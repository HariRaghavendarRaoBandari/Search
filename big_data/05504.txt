X-Ray Spectra of The High-Mass X-RAY Binary 4U 1700-37

using BeppoSAX, Suzaku and RXTE Observations

Elena Seiﬁna1, Lev Titarchuk2 & Nikolai Shaposhnikov3

ABSTRACT

We present an X-ray spectral analysis of the high-mass binary 4U 1700-37
during its hard-soft state evolution. We use the BeppoSAX, Suzaku and RXTE
(Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer) observations for this investigation. We argue
that the X-ray broad-band spectra during all spectral states can be adequately
reproduced by a model, consisting of a low-temperature Blackbody component,
two Comptonized components both due to the presence of a Compton cloud
(CC) that up-scatters seed photons of Ts1
∼ 1.4 keV, and Ts2 <1 keV, and
an iron-line component. We ﬁnd using this model that the photon power-law
index is almost constant, Γ1 ∼ 2 for all spectral states. However, Γ2 shows a
behavior depending on the spectral state. Namely, Γ2 is quasi-constant at the
level of Γ2 ∼ 2 while the CC plasma temperature kT (2)
is less than 40
keV; on the other hand, Γ2 is in the range of 1.3 < Γ2 < 2, when kT (2)
is greater than 40 keV. We explain this quasi-stability of Γ during most of
hard-soft transitions of 4U 1700-37 in a framework of the model in which the
resulting spectrum is described by two Comptonized components. We ﬁnd that
these Comptonized spectral components of the HMXB 4U 1700-37 are similar
to those previously found in NS sources. This index dependence versus
both mass accretion rate and kTe revealed in 4U 1700-37 is a universal
observational evidence for the presence of a NS in 4U 1700-37.

Introduction

Our knowledge of diagnostics for a BH or a NS presence in X-ray binaries has been
challenged in the last years by growing observational evidence that the spectral index is
uniquely sensitive to the type of the compact object (NS or BH ) during burst events
(Titarchuk & Shaposhnikov, 2005; Shaposhnikov & Titarchuk 2009; Shrader et al. 2010;
Farinelli & Titarchuk, 2011; Titarchuk et al. 2014, hereafter TSS14). In other words, this
observational signature can be used as a probe for the nature of a compact star.
The photon index Γ of the energy spectrum tends to be quasi-constant, around Γ ∼ 2 (or
the spectral index α = Γ − 1 ∼ 1) for a neutron star. When Γ monotonically increases with
an outburst ﬂux and then saturates at the burst peak, this compact object is identiﬁed as
a black hole (BH). The observational behavior of the index in a NS is combined with the
speciﬁc decrease of Γ, from the level of Γ = 2 to Γ < 2 at the high plasma temperatures of
the transition layer (TL) when kTe > 50 keV [see SST14 and Seiﬁna et al. (2015), hereafter
STSS15]. This speciﬁc behavior of Γ versus kTe is never observed in BHs and thus can be
considered as a spectral signature of a NS.

The index correlations for BHs were demonstrated by Shaposhnikov & Titarchuk (2009),
hereafter ST09. Seiﬁna & Titarchuk (2011), hereafter ST11, discovered the photon index
behavior versus mass accretion rate in NSs, and then it was conﬁrmed by TSS14. Because the
above NS diagnostic was only tested for low mass X-ray binaries (LMXB), now we decided
to check this index versus mass accretion rate correlation also for high mass X-ray binaries
(HMXB). Therefore, it is important to test this method, using this index versus mass accre-
tion correlation, in application to HMXBs which are relatively young sources consisted of a
massive early-type stellar companion (OB/Be-type star) and a compact object (NS or BH).
In some Be/X-ray binaries X-rays are produced when matter accretes to a compact object
passing through the dense equatorial disk of Be-star. Other HMXBs contain a more massive
OB supergiant, which is characterized by stellar winds with mass-loss rates of 10−7 to 10−5
M⊙ per year. A fraction of this outﬂow may be attracted by a compact object. Usually,
HMXBs with O-B stars produce periodic X-ray outbursts in a case of high eccentric binary
orbits during periastron passages. For the circular orbit cases, some of OB/X-ray binaries
containing supergiants, demonstrate large sporadic X-ray ﬂares. Roche lobe overﬂow usually
leads to an accretion disk and a wind. Long-term observation revealed precession eﬀects in
V-optical light curve (see Khruzina & Cherepashchyk, 1983) which can be interpreted as an
indication of a disk component in accretion ﬂow.

These binaries usually host black holes [e.g., Cyg X-1 and a number of HMXBs in
the Magellanic Clouds and the Milky Way, see a review by Lewin & van der Klis (2010)].
HMXB 4U 1700-37 is an interesting example of such OB/X-ray binary. However, the nature

– 3 –

of the compact object in this system is still an open question (a NS or a BH?) in spite of
the fact that observations of 4U 1700-37 have been obtained for more than 40 years.

4U 1700-37 is a well studied accreting supergiant X-ray binary (SgXB) ﬁrst detected by
the Uhuru satellite in 1970s (see Jones et al. 1973). A companion star is O6.5 Iaf supergiant
with a fairly well measured mass and radius (Abubekerov 2004; Rubin et al. 1996; Heap
& Corcoran 1992). 4U 1700-37 displays regular eclipses every 3.41 days, which are ﬁrmly
associated with the orbital period (see Table 1 for other binary parameters). This eclipse
covers about 14% of the orbit (i.e. 0.5 days), and residual emission is visible during this
period probably because of scattering of X-rays in a wind from the supergiant star (Boroson
et al. 2013). The compact object associated with this system does not exhibit any pulsation,
while Boroson et al. (2003) reported an information on quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs).
Most of NSs in X-ray binaries demonstrate coherent pulsations [see e.g. Ford & van der Klis
(1998) that in 4U 1728-34]. Thus, the origin of the compact object in 4U 1700-37 is not
clear (see Gottwald et al. 1986; Clark et al. 2002).
In comparisons with other SgXBs,
the 4U 1700-37 source displays prominent X-ray long and short variabilities which are very
similar to those seen, for example, in Vela X-1 [see Kreykenbolm et al. (2008)].
Prominent X-ray ﬂares in 4U 1700-37 are observed by INTEGRAL for which ﬂux increases
up to two orders of magnitude (by a factor of ∼100), often reaching 1.5 Crab, or more (see
Kuulkers et al. 2007). This can be due to an increase of the rate of wind-fed accretion
or due to magnetospheric storms. That behavior of 4U 1700-37 is similar to that seen in
previous observations by CGRO/BATSE, GRANAT/SIGMA (Markert et al. 1979; Pietsch
et al. 1980; Laurent et al. 1992; Rubin et al. 1996; Kudryavtsev et al. 2001; Laycock et al.
2003; Orr et al. 2004).

Because of non-detection of pulsations and the observed X-ray hard tails, Brown et
al. (1996) proposed that this source is a BH candidate. However, Reynolds et al. 1999
found that the 2 – 200 keV BeppoSAX spectrum of 4U 1700-37 was ﬁtted by a high energy
cutoﬀ power-law model which is a typical spectrum of an accretion powered X-ray pulsars.
Moreover, using the BeppoSAX spectrum, Reynolds et al. (1999) also declared a presence of
cyclotron absorption feature at ∼37 keV.

Suzaku observations possibly revealed a pronounced cyclotron absorption feature at ∼39
keV and spectral variability on ks time scales, due to both variable absorption around the
average value of 2 × 1022 cm−2 and changes in the spectral slope (Jaisawal & Naik, 2015).
These results argue against a possibility of a black hole in the 4U 1700-37 source.

High resolution spectra of XMM-Newton and Chandra observations were well ﬁtted by a
two component absorption model which was previously utilized for interpretation of the 1991
April GINGA observations (see Boroson et al. 2003 and van der Meer et al. 2005). The

– 4 –

Chandra observations during the intermittent ﬂare state of 4U 1700-37 revealed ﬂuorescence
emission lines from neutral atoms and the recombination lines from H and He like species.
The line strengths varied over the observations. Boroson et al. (2003) found that triplet
structure in Mg and Si points to the non-equilibrium of photo-ionized plasma. During eclipse
and low ﬂux time intervals of the binary van der Meer et al. (2005) found many ﬂuorescence
emission lines as well as recombination lines in the XMM-Newton spectrum of 4U 1700-37.
An extended ionization region around the source was suggested because of presence of these
recombination lines. Using the Chandra observations Boroson et al. (2003) also revealed a
few of mHz QPOs in the power density spectra of 4U 1700-37.

We found a large range in the mass evaluations of the compact object (MX) and sec-
ondary star (MV ) in 4U 1700-37 (see Table 1). Recent mass estimates of MX = 2.44±0.27M⊙
(Clark et al. 2002; Rude et al. 2010) are signiﬁcantly above the usually accepted mass
limit for neutron stars. It is worth noting that Abubekerov (2004) analyzed radial-velocity
curves of hydrogen Balmer absorption lines for the 4U 1700-37 source using the 1973 – 1976
IUE spectral data (see Hammerschlang-Hensberge et al. 1978). They estimated MX (i)
using the current paradigm about the gravitational acceleration of the optical component
(MX ∼ 2.2 ± 0.2 M⊙), (ii) using a radius of the optical component (MX ∼ 1.7 ± 0.2 M⊙)
and (iii) based on the mass-luminosity relation (MX ∼ 1.41 ± 0.08 M⊙). The upper limit of
these estimates is in agreement with the results of Dolan (2011) in which MX ∼ 2.44 M⊙
(see also similar estimates by Clark et al., 2002; Rude et al., 2010) and thus these estimates
are signiﬁcantly above the usually accepted mass limit for the neutron star. The dynamical
measurement of this compact object mass can be taken as a demonstration that the object
is a BH. However, such a mass estimate is not a conclusive argument for the compact object
nature. A real proof should be followed from an observational corrobaration of the absence
or presence of any solid surface for a particular object.

In this paper, we use an essentially new method for diagnostic of the compact ob-
ject origin in 4U 1700-37 applying an analysis of available RXTE, BeppoSAX and Suzaku
observations. The list of observations used for the data analysis is shown in §2, while in
§3 we describe a reader details of our spectral analysis. We discuss how X-ray properties
change during the low−high spectral state transition of 4U 1700-37 in §4. We make our ﬁnal
conclusions in §5.

2. Details of observations and reduction of the data

2.1. Data Selection

2.1.1. BeppoSAX

BeppoSAX in April of 1997 observed 4U 1700-37 during uneclipsed interval, ϕ = 0.45 ÷
0.59 (see Table 1). We obtained the broad-band energy spectrum of the source using the
combined data from three BeppoSAX Narrow Field Instruments (NFIs): the Low Energy
Concentrator Spectrometer [LECS; Parmar et al.
(1997)], the Medium Energy Concentra-
tor Spectrometer [MECS; Boella et al.
(1997)] and the Phoswich Detection System [PDS;
Frontera et al.
(1997)] for the 0.3 − 4 keV, 1.8 − 10 keV and the 15−150 keV ranges re-
spectively. The source spectra were extracted from the event data using a circular region
centered on the source of radius 30". While an annulus region within 30" and 180" radii
was used to determine the background. We applied the SAXDAS data analysis package for
data reprocessing. We carried out the spectral analysis in the energy band for which the
response is well known. In a model ﬁtting we treated a relative normalization of the NFIs
as a free parameter while the MECS normalization was frozen at a value of 1. This method
led to cross-normalization factors in the range, expected for each of these instruments 1.

The spectra were rebinned according to instrument energy resolution to have signiﬁcant
statistics in each bin. Thus, the LECS spectra were rebinned using an energy dependent
binning factor (see §3.1.6 of Cookbook for the BeppoSAX NFI spectral analysis) and ap-
plying rebinning template ﬁles provided by GRPPHA of XSPEC2. The PDS spectra were
rebinned with a binning factor 2, grouping two bins together (resulting bin width is 1 keV).
For the BeppoSAX analyzed spectra we applied a systematic error of 1%. The BeppoSAX
observations taken for our analysis are listed in Table 2.

2.1.2. Suzaku

During the binary uneclipsed interval spanning 0.29 – 0.72 orbital phases Suzaku in
2006, September 13−14 observed 4U 1700-37 (see details in Rubin et al. 1996). The obser-
vations were implemented in ”XIS nominal” position using an eﬀective exposure of ∼ 82.1
ks and ∼ 81.5 ks for HXD and XIS, respectively. XIS detectors worked in the ”burst” clock

– 6 –

mode with ”1/4 window” option providing time resolution of 1 s. For the Suzaku observa-
tions we utilized publicly available data (version 2.0.6.13). We used for our data analysis
HEASOFT software package (version 6.13) and calibration database (CALDB) released
on 2012 February 10 and 2011 September 13 for XIS and HXD, respectively. We applied
the unﬁltered event ﬁles for each of the operational XIS detectors (XIS0, 1 and 3) using the
latest HEASOFT software package (version 6.13) and following the Suzaku Data Reduction
Guide3. We obtained cleaned event ﬁles by re-running the Suzaku pipeline implementing
the latest calibration database (CALDB) available since 2013, January 20 and also applying
the associated screening criteria ﬁles.

Thus, we got the 4U 1700-37 spectra from the ﬁltered XIS event data taking a circular
region, centered on the source, of radius 30", and the corresponding background spectra from
an annulus region with 30" and 180" radii. Using the BeppoSAX sample we considered the
background region to be in the vicinity of the source extraction region. We extracted spectra
and lightcurves from the cleaned event ﬁles using XSELECT, and we generated responses
for each detector utilizing the XISRESP script with a medium resolution.

Implementing reprocessed HXD/PIN event ﬁle and XSELECT package of FTOOLS
we created HXD/PIN spectra and light curve of 4U 1700-37. Applying tuned non X-ray
background (NXB4) event ﬁle we accumulated the HXD/PIN background light curves and
spectrum. We included a correction for cosmic X-ray background (CXB5) in the PIN spectra
as recommended by the instrument team.

In these Suzaku observations we have also found ﬂare-type variability of a factor of 100
(XIS-0) on time scales from minute to hours. We assumed that the above X-ray variabil-
ity versus orbital phase within these observations was caused by a clumping wind structure
or local NH variations. Note, that this kind on inhomogeneity has already been ob-
served in other SgXBs, like 4U 1538-52 and GX 301-2 [see Rodes-Roca et al.
(2015) and Evangelista et al.

(2010), respectively].

Thus, we did not relate these X-ray variations to mass accretion rate changes ( ˙M ). A
time averaged spectral analysis was implemented using the HXD/PIN and XIS-0 spectra.
We carried out spectral ﬁtting applying XSPEC v12.7.1. The energy ranges around of 1.75
and 2.23 keV are not used for spectral ﬁtting because of the known artiﬁcial structures in
the XIS spectra around the Si and Au edges. Therefore, for spectral ﬁts we have chosen the

– 7 –

0.3 – 10 keV range for the XISs (excluding 1.75 and 2.23 keV points) and the 15 – 70 keV
range for the PIN spectrum.

2.1.3. RXTE

For our analysis, we have also applied publicly available data of the RXTE acquired
from 1996 September to 2003 September. These data consist of 62 observations related
to diﬀerent spectral states of the source. For data processing we utilized standard tasks
of the LHEASOFT/FTOOLS 5.3 software package. Spectral analysis was implemented
using PCA Standard 2 mode data, collected in the 3−23 keV range and applying the most
updated release of PCA response calibration (ftool pcarmf v11.7). We also used the standard
dead time correction to the data and the data from HEXTE detectors to make broad-band
spectra. A background collected during oﬀ-source observations was subtracted. For the
spectral analysis we took only the HEXTE data in the 19−200 keV range. The GSFC public
archive (http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov) can provide these data. In Table 3 we present a list
of observations which covers the complete sample of the state evolution of the source.

One can assess the source intensity on month timescale using an example of the light
curve (during 1996 September) of the All Sky Monitor (ASM, Levine et al. 1996) onboard
of RXTE shown in Figure 1. As we have already mentioned above, 4U 1700-37 displays
a prominent variability in the soft band which can be associated with long-term variation
(of order of ten days) and short-term variability on a daily (hourly) timescale (see e.g. see
Kuulkers et al. 2007). Extremely large sporadic outbursts indicate that this system can
be also aﬀected by short periods of disk-accretion, especially when soft X-ray luminosity
(proportional to ˙M) increases signiﬁcantly (Fryxell & Taam, 1988; Romano et al. 2015).
This type of variability of 4U 1700-37 is the main focus of the present investigation.
In
order to do this, we have made an analysis of RXTE observations of this source spanning
seven years and divided them to ﬁve intervals indicated in Table 3. We modeled the RXTE
spectra using XSPEC ﬁtting package and we applied a systematic uncertainty of 0.5% to all
analyzed spectra.

3. Results

As we have already pointed out above, 4U 1700-37 shows a complex X-ray behavior
on a time scale of ∼ day probably caused by orbital modulation (Rubin et al.,
1998). The source soft photons are also subject to a variable inner absorption related to

– 8 –

dipping into a stellar wind during of orbital motion (Buﬀ & McCray, 1964; Haberl et al.,
1989; Branduardi et al., 1978). Orbital variation of X-ray absorption can be additionally
modiﬁed by gas stream (Haberl et al, 1989), wind interaction (Titarchuk et al., 2007; By-
chkov & Seiﬁna, 1996a,b) and bow shock trailing the compact object (Livio et al., 1979;
Blondin et al., 1990; Saraswat et al., 1996). Stellar wind from supergiant stars are
known to be inhomogeneous, because of clumping in the hot-star winds [see, for
example, a model by Hamann et al.
(2008)]. The presence of these dense clumps
dramatically aﬀects the mass loss regime and causes sporadic suborbital variability. Note,
that aforementioned variabilities are not related to any global changes in ˙M . Indeed, X-ray
emission of 4U 1700-37 is modiﬁed by transitions between the spectral states (the low/hard
and high/soft ones), which are usually a result of signiﬁcant changes of

˙M (see below).

Here, we focus on a type of variability and spectral properties of 4U 1700-37 related to
the mass accretion rate changes. Thus, we have only selected observations during the binary
uneclipsed intervals of orbital period. X-ray eclipse takes place around optical primary
minima, in the phase interval 0.93 < ϕ < 1.07 (see van Paradijs, Hammmerschlag-
Hensberge & Zuiderwijk 1978). To exclude the eclipse orbital modulation we have
only utilized observations occurred in interval 0.07 ≤ ϕ ≤ 0.93. This resulted in 90
out-of-eclipse intervals. It is worth noting that 27 observations occurred during eclipses.
We applied the ephemeris of Rubin et al. (1996): orbital period Porb = 3.411581(27) d and
mid-eclipse T0 = JD 2 448 900.873(2) to calculate the orbital phase

3.1. Hardness-intensity and Color-color diagrams of 4U 1700-37

To evaluate the source spectral evolution in time we build hard (HC) and
soft colors (SC) making color-color diagrams (CCDs). Figure 2 shows CCDs and hardness-
intensity diagrams (HIDs) (see left panel and right panel, respectively). CCD presents the
count ratios: hard color (20-40 keV/9-20 keV) versus soft color (4-9 keV/2-4 keV), while HID
demonstrates hard color (20-40 keV/9-20 keV) versus PCA count rate (2-40 keV). ObsIds of
the observational sets are indicated on the top of the right panel of Figure 2. As we show our
data sets related the low/hard to the high/soft states cover diﬀerent parts of the CCD and
HID. We also mark the data of the diﬀerent sets as red for ObsId 10148-01-01-000, blue for
ObsId 10148-01-02-00, bright blue for ObsId 10148-01-03-000, green for ObsId 30094-01-01-
00, crimson for ObsId 30094-01-02-00, yellow for ObsId 30094-01-03-00 and black for ObsIs
30094-01-04-00, 30094-01-05-00.

Data sets that we investigated are associated with diﬀerent epoch. Clearly our data do
not indicate a secular shift eﬀect. The CCD and HID form plain and smooth tracks. Note,

– 9 –

that the HMXB 4U 1700-37 is similar to LMXBs (Z-sources and atolls) in terms of their
CCDs and HIDs [see, for example Seiﬁna et al.

(2015)].

As one can also see, 4U 1700-37 demonstrates a typical outburst behavior, marked by
CCD/HID track evolution from the LHS to the HSS. The CCD and HID tracks are, however,
an empirical description and thus one needs a physical interpretation of their behavior.
Therefore, we intend to apply these data for a detailed X-ray analysis of the spectral evolution
of the source.

3.2. Details of Spectral analysis

3.2.1. Selection of the Spectral Model

Because of the debated orgin of the compact object in 4U 1700-47 (a NS
or a BH), we test the source spectrum using diﬀerent models in application to Suzaku,
BeppoSAX and RXT E observations (see examples of the source spectra in Figs. 3−4). We
should point out that diﬀerent Comptonization models are usually used for a BH (e.g., Stiele
et al. 2013) and for a NS (e.g., Farinelli et al. 2003; Paizis et al. 2006). Speciﬁcally, we
started with a model of an absorbed bbody plus the Comptb. The line feature at 6 – 7
keV range is approximated using the Gaussian line proﬁle. This model [phabs*(bbody+-
comptb+gaussian)] is successfully applied for BH spectral modelling (see also, STS14). In the
case of 4U 1700-37, however this model poorly ﬁts the data as it is clearly seen from Figure 4,
where we demonstrate the 4U 1700-37 spectrum (ObsId=10148-01-02-00) observed by RXTE
on 1996, September 13 along with the ﬁt residuals ∆χ. On the left panel the model, which
the phabs*(bbody+comptb+gaussian) model,
includes a single Comptb component, i.e.
is applied. Clearly from this plot the model gives unacceptable ﬁt (χ2
red = 12.3 for 86
dof). Signiﬁcant positive residuals at high energies (E > 60 keV) indicate the existence
of an additional emission component. As a result, we also add another Comptonized
component (Comptb2) with a diﬀerent seed photon temperature (kT (2)
s ) which results in
a signiﬁcant improvement of the ﬁt (see below).

In Figure 4 (right panel) we demonstrate the best-ﬁt spectrum, and ∆χ for this ﬁt where
the model is: phabs*(bbody+comptb1+comptb2+gauss). This model includes two Comptb
components and χ2
red = 1.12 for 81 dof. We show the data by crosses and the spectral
model is presented by light-blue line. The components of the model are color-coded
in red, green, dark-blue and crimson lines for Comptb1, Comptb2, Blackbody and Gaussian
components, respectively.

We have also applied various models to the available BeppoSAX and Suzaku data us-

– 10 –

ing a better spectral coverage and detector resolution for the 0.3−200 keV range (see Ta-
ble 4).
In Figure 3 we show the BeppoSAX (left, ObsId=20339001) and Suzaku (right,
ObsId=401058010) spectra of 4U 1700-37 ﬁtted using the two-Comptb model. The data
are shown by crosses and the best-ﬁt spectral model, phabs*(bbody + comptb + comptb +
gaussian) by light-blue line. The model components are also presented by red, green, dark-
blue and crimson lines for Comptb1, Comptb2, Blackbody and Gaussian line, respectively.
∆χ versus photon energy in keV is shown in the bottom panels. The best-ﬁt parameters of
the model for the BeppoSAX data (see left panel) are Γ1=2.00±0.03, kT (1)
e =15.3±0.4 keV,
Γ2=1.41±0.02, kT (2)
red=0.96
for 335 dof). Notably, Reynolds et al. (1999) ﬁtted the same data by an absorbed power-law
model, combined with a high energy cutoﬀ, low energy thermal bremsstrahlung components,
an iron line and cyclotron absorption component. While this model is often used for accret-
ing pulsar spectra ﬁtting, it provides almost the same power-law index of 2.07±0.02 as that
in our model for the ﬁst Comptonized component, Comptb1. Using the second Comptonized
component of our model, Comptb2, we found that the hard tail in 4U 1700-37 spectrum is
similar to one observed in 4U 1705-44 (see STSS15).

e =96±8 keV, kTBB=0.56±0.07 keV and Eline=6.48±0.07 keV (χ2

As we have already mentioned, Jaisawal & Naik (2015) applied another
model to ﬁt the Suzaku spectra. In particular, they used a combination of partial
covering NPEX, a high energy cutoﬀ power-law model, three Gaussian-line and
cyclotron absorption components. As a result, they claimed a detection of a
cyclotron line at ∼ 39 keV. Using BeppoSAX data Reynolds et al. (1999) also
suggested an existence of the cyclotron absorption feature at ∼37 keV in the
spectrum. Keeping in mind these results, we have also tested the presence of
this line centered at ∼ 36 – 39 keV using these available BeppoSAX and Suzaku
spectral data and our spectral model. While this model is statistically valid but its
performace is worse than that using our model (see Table 4).

More speciﬁcally, we ﬁtted these spectral data using phabs ∗ cyclabs ∗ (bbody +
comptb1+comptb2+gauss) model. For the BeppoSAX spectrum (ObsId=20339001)
we found χ2
red = 1.17(335 dof), while for the Suzaku one (ObsId=401058010) we
obtained χ2
red = 1.21(416 dof).

In fact, one cannot see any structure near ∼40 keV in the residuals of our
spectra (see Figure 3). Thus, we are not able to support the presence of this
line in the BeppoSAX and Suzaku spectra using our spectral model.

3.2.2. Modelling of 4U 1700-37 spectra with two-Comptonization components

The best-ﬁt models for RXTE, BeppoSAX and Suzaku spectra were obtained using
the two-COMPTB model phabs*(Bbody+Comptb1+Comptb2+Gauss). In fact, this model
provides a physical picture, in contrast to previously models applied to X-ray spectra of
4U 1700-37 (see e.g., Reynolds et al. 1999; van der Meer et al. 2005; Jaisawal & Naik, 2015).
We want to emphasize that the two-COMPTB model is usually applied to NS spectra,
because in NSs, the two Comptonized components are created in the CC for which the
seed photons come from the NS surface and the accretion disk. On the other hand, in a BH
the seed soft photons are only produced in the accretion disk which is located next to the
relatively hot CC.

Our model for 4U 1700-37 describes a scenario in which an accretion disk is connected
to the compact object (NS) through the Compton cloud (CC) (see a possible geometry ﬁgure
in STSS15). Note, X-ray ﬂux is highly variable (by factor ∼ 100), showing evidence for a
clumpy stellar wind (Jaisawal & Naik 2015), which probably results in a varying accretion
rate.

In our picture, the emergent thermal Comptonization spectrum is formed in the hot
Compton cloud (CC), where soft photons of temperature kTs1 from the neutron star and the
accretion disk of temperature kTs2 are up-scattered oﬀ the hot electrons giving rise to two
components, Comptb1 and Comptb2, respectively. Some fraction of these seed soft photons
can be also observed directly from by the Earth, that explains why we add a soft black-
body of the temperature TBB with normalization NBB. Note, the Comptb model describes
the resulting spectrum as a convolution of a seed blackbody of normalization NCom and
temperature kTs with the Comptonization Green function.

The spectral index of the emergent spectra of the Comptonization component is de-
termined by the energy release in the CC. As TSS14 demonstrate that if the gravitational
energy release occurs throughout the cloud around a NS then the spectral index should be
around 1 (or the photon index Γ is around 2). However, if the release of the energy takes
place only in outer portion of the CC then the spectral index α is less than 1 (or Γ is less
than 2). The latter case is realized in the sources for which the local emergent luminosity
exceeds the Eddington limit and where the plasma temperature of the CC outer part is
higher than 30 keV. Note, that in this particular case the critical luminosity can be a factor
of 1.2-1.4 higher than the Eddington one depending on a value of kTe (see TSS14 and Figure
10 there). This eﬀect of the index decrease has been established in Sco X-1 and 4U 1705-44
(see TSS14 and STSS15, respectively), which are characterized by high luminosites. Our
goal is to investigate this eﬀect in 4U 1700-37.

where L is source luminosity of a source and D is distance to the source. The free param-
eters of the applied model, phabs*(Bbody+Comptb1+Comptb2+Gauss), are: the equiva-
lent hydrogen absorption column density NH; the spectral indices α1, α2; the seed photon
temperatures Ts1, Ts2; log(A1) and log(A2) are linked to the Comptonized fractions f1, f2
(f = A/(1 + A)); the plasma temperatures T (1)
; normalizations of NCom1 and
NCom2 of the Comptb1 and Comptb2, respectively. In the model we also include a XSPEC
Gaussian, whose parameters are Eline, the line width σline and line normalization Nline, to
ﬁt the data in the 6−8 keV range.

and T (2)

e

e

Note, we ﬁxed the following Comptb model parameters: γ = 3 and δ = 0 [see meaning
(2014)). The value of log(A) is frozen at 2 when
of these parameters in Titarchuk et al.
log(A) ≫ 1 because the model ﬁt becomes insensitive to the parameter f = A/(1 + A). We
list all best-ﬁt parameters in Table 4.

The most important issue is how the photon index behaves depending on the diﬀerent
model parameters. These dependences are crucial for understanding the compact object
origin in 4U 1700-37. In this respect, for the Suzaku and BeppoSAX data (see Table 4) we
ﬁnd that the spectral indices α1 and α2 are around 1.00±0.02 and 0.34±0.08, respectively (or
Γ1 = α + 1 and Γ2 = α2 + 1 are 2.02±0.02 and 1.34±0.08, respectively). We also reveal that
kTs1 and kTs2 change in the intervals of 1.3−1.4 keV and 0.8−0.84 keV, correspondingly,
for all available data sets. Thus, using Suzaku and BeppoSAX data we reveal two main
blackbody sources: the ﬁrst one is associated with the NS surface as the second one is
presumably associated with the accretion disk region for which kTs1 ∼ 1.3 keV and kTs2 ∼ 0.8
keV, respectively (see Table 4).

RXTE detectors can provide data only above 3 keV, while using the broad energy band
of Suzaku and BeppoSAX we can ﬁnd the low energy blackbody parameters. Thus, for
the RXTE spectra we should ﬁx the blackbody temperature at a value of kTBB =0.6 keV
obtained using our analysis of the Suzaku and BeppoSAX data. In Tables 5 and 6 we report
the best-ﬁt spectral parameters of the two-Comptb model as a result of analysis of the RXTE
observations.
. In Figure 5 we show six spectral evolution diagrams (see upper and lower
panels). The RXTE data (denoted by crosses) correspond to observations, 30094-01-01-10
(green); 3009401-12-00 (orange); 30095-02-02-20 (violet); 30094-01-33-00 (red), 30094-01-31-
00 (blue) and 30095-01-01-00 (black). Moreover, from Figure 5 we can establish how the
spectral shape changes in the energies greater than 30 keV reﬂecting an eﬀect of a sum of the
two Comptonized components for diﬀerent states. The hard tail at 50−200 keV grows with

– 13 –

X-ray luminosity, except for the intermediate soft state [see 30094-01-33-00 spectrum (red)].
In our data we have found many spectra with the strong high energy tail which extended to
200 keV (see Figure 5).

As one can see from Tables 4-6 normalization of the Comptb1 component changes in
the range of 0.01 to 22.6 in units of L37/D2
10 (where L37 is the seed blackbody luminosity
in units 1037 erg sec−1 and D10 is distance in units of 10 kpc), while the photon index Γ1
is almost constant (Γ1 = 1.99 ± 0.06) for all set of observations (see Fig. 6, left diagram).
However, we established a two-phase sample for Γ2: the phase of the quasi-constancy of
Γ2 = 2.01 ± 0.07 when kT (2)
changes in the 3−40 keV interval; and the low photon index
phase of Γ2 < 2 for kT (2)
e > 40 keV (see Figure 6, right panel). Note that the Gaussian
line width σline does not change much and numerous ﬁts indicate that σline varies in the 0.5
– 0.8 keV range. Thus, σline has been ﬁxed at 0.7 keV for all RXT E spectral ﬁts. The
plasma temperatures kT (1)
change in broad ranges of 2−22 keV and 19−100 keV,
respectively (see Tables 4-6 and Figure 6).

3.3. Overall picture of X-ray properties

In Figure 6 we also plot the photon indices Γ1 (blue) and Γ2 (red) versus the seed photon
temperatures Ts1, Ts2 which related to the up-scattering of the NS and accretion disk soft
photons. As one can see from this Figure that Γ2 < 2 when the kTs2 decreases from 1.1 to
0.8 keV. This is the strong demonstration that Γ2 drops when the Compton cloud area
enlarges. As we have already pointed out the diminishing index phase corresponds to the
high plasma temperature phase (kT (2)
in the 2−30 keV range the
index remains constant.

This two component Comptonization model gives very good ﬁts for all in-
vestigated data sets. From Figures 3 – 5 one can see that the source spectra are
well ﬁtted by our two−Comptb model: χ2
red ∼ 1 for most of the cases. For 2% of
the observations corresponding to higher S/N χ2

red reaches 1.4.

From top to bottom in Figure 1 we show the RXTE/ASM count rate evolution dur-
ing the R2 1999 observations, the (10-50 keV)/(3-10 keV) ratio (pink) and the (50-
200 keV)/(3-10 keV) ratio (green), kT (1)

Comptb1, Comptb2 and Bbody components (red, blue and black, respectively), and the
indices α1 and α2 (red and blue, correspondingly). Notably, the Bbody component is very
weak, sometimes it is detected at the limit of “visibility”. However, for a number outburst
states we detected the strengthening of this component. Blue vertical strips denote the light

curve phases when the Bbody component increases. The photon index Γ2 drops when kTe
increases (see bottom panel of Fig. 1). We should emphasize once again that the photon in-
dex, Γ2 correlates with kTs2 (see Fig. 6, left panel) which clearly indicates the CC expansion.
The disk seed photons, in this case, come from the cooler outer regions [see Seiﬁna et al.
(2015) for a possible geometry of the source].

4. Discussion

4.1. Quasi-constancy of the index is a signature of a NS

Using our analysis of the index evolution in 4U 1700-37 we have ﬁrmly established the Γ1
quasi-constancy versus Comptb normalization NCom1, (proportional to ˙M ) and also versus
other parameters, kTs and kTe (see Fig. 6). FT10 and ST11 argue that this Γ stability is a
signature of solid surface of a compact object, pointing to a NS presence in the HMXB
4U 1700-37. On the other hand the photon index Γ2 decrease is directly related to expansion
of the transition layer (TL) due to high radiation pressure when the index drops and the
plasma temperature kTe increases (see Fig. 6). TSS14 explained this observational eﬀect.
At high luminosity the radiation pressure from the NS photons stops the falling
plasma. As a consequence the gravitational energy deposition only takes place in
an outer part of the transition layer where the plasma temperature is high (above
30 keV). At such temperatures the critical luminosity is not achieved. Observationally, the
expansion of the TL is also conﬁrmed by a decrease of the seed photon temperature kTs2.
Thus, the photon index Γ2 demonstrates the stability at the sub-Eddington luminosity and
a decrease at the high plasma temperature state as was previously found in Sco X-1 (TSS14)
and 4U1705-44 (STSS15).

Note that only three sources, 4U 1705-44, 4U 1700-37 and Sco X-1 show a drop of
the photon index (see Figure 7). However, this index eﬀect in 4U 1700-37 begins at lower
kTe ∼ 40 keV, than that in Sco X-1 (kTe ∼ 60 keV) and 4U 1705-44 (kTe ∼ 80 keV). We
should point out that in Sco X-1 the maximum of the plasma temperature, kT max
exceeds
100 keV while that for 4U 1700-37 and 4U 1705-44 are in the range kT max
e ∼ 95 − 100 keV
(see Figure 7).

4.2. Possible detection of the switches between the wind and disk accretion

regimes

The optical component in 4U 1700-37 is characterized by a strong wind as it is usu-
ally observed in O−supergiants. The wind velocity near inner Lagrange point increases
(Abubekerov, 2004). SgXB 4U 1700-37 have also been proposed to undergo episodes of disk
accretion due to the formation of short lived accretion disks (see, e.g., Fryxell & Taam 1988).
Generally, the angular momentum of the fast wind launched from a supergiant star is too
low to form a disk (Ducci et al. 2009). However, this is not true if the velocity of the wind
is strongly reduced by the eﬀect of ionization of the X-rays emitted from the NS (in this
case the line driven acceleration mechanism can be nearly turned oﬀ). As discussed recently
by Romano et al. (2015), in systems with an orbital period of a few days (5 – 10 days)
and a moderate eccentricity, a disk is likely to form when the velocity of the wind from the
massive companion drops by a factor of ∼100 (i.e. from thousands to tens of km/s). Thus,
when accretion switches from the wind to the disk mode, X-ray luminosity is expected to
rise signiﬁcantly (≃ 1037 − 1038 erg/s), due to the enhanced disk mass accretion rate. A
rapid spin up phase is also expected to take place due to the angular momentum of the disk
material that acquired by the NS during the accretion process (Klochkov et al. 2011 and
Jenke et al. 2012).

Variable inner absorption is an observational evidence in favor of accretion disk for-
mation in 4U 1700-37. In fact, the absorption amount should rises as the compact object
appears behind the wind dense parts, close to eclipse ingress and egress. However, this ab-
sorption is asymmetric about orbital phase ϕ = 0.5 in this system (Branduardi, Mason, &
Sanford 1978). Mason et al. 1976 and Haberl et al. 1989 that a sharp increase in absorption
at ϕ ≥ 0.6 is related to a region of increased density. Boroson et al. (2003) detected a ”soft
excess” in the ﬂux at ϕ ≃ 0.7. Haberl, White, & Kallman (1989) pointed out that this
absorption excess at ϕ > 0.6 could be due to an accretion taking 8% of the gas ﬂow that
accretes through the disk.

Using BeppoSAX, Suzaku and RXTE observations, we ﬁnd two blackbody emission
sources: the ﬁrst one is probably associated with the disk and the second is presumably
associated with the neutron star (NS), for which soft photon temperatures are about 1 keV
or less and 1.4 keV, respectively. We also established that some spectra can be ﬁtted
with an additional Blackbody (with normalization Nbb and kTbb ∼ 0.6 keV), while
other spectra do not require this component. Note, the absense of the Bbody
at 0.6 keV is generally related to the low/hard states of 4U 1700-37, while its
detection is strictly accompanied by ﬂaring events. These episodes are marked
by vertical strips in Figure 1 to relate these episodes to transient accretion disk

– 16 –

events. One can also see that these ﬂaring events are associated with drops of the index
Γ2 and surges of Nbb (∝ ˙M ) by factor 10. Therefore, we can relate these moments with
transient accretion disk events. In fact, we have found six of these intervals, in which we
suggest switches between the wind and disk accretion regimes.

In the case of very low Nbb at 0.6 keV we ﬁx Nbb at 0.001×L39/D2

10, in order to model
and compare our results for all spectral states and use the same model for all states.
This procedure allows us to take into account a weak accretion disk.

In our case, the extended power-law is a tail of the Comptonization spectrum which
is created in the outer hot part of the Compton cloud and we have already demonstrated
and explained this PL phenomenon for a number of NS sources (see STSS15, TSS14 for
details). Thus, our spectral model has a basic, physical meaning, because it relies on the
Comptonization of two sources of soft photons, one coming from the NS and the other
has the disk origin. As for the Bbody source, these soft photons come from outer part of
the extended disk.

It is worth noting that we keep log A = 2 when A ≫ 1 because an illumination
factor f=A/(1+A) is close to one in this case. We should also clarify a relation
between the XSPEC COMPTT and COMPTB models because they are widely
used for modeling X-ray data. The COMPTT model parameters are the optical
depth, which value depends on an assumed geometry, and the plasma tempera-
ture Te. We prefer to be independ on any assumption of the plasma cloud (TL)
geometry. Thus, we use the COMPTB model where the main parameters are
the spectral index α and the plasma temperature Te. Instead of using the optical
depth and plasma temperature provided by the COMPTT one can simply apply
the COMPTB model.

Our Figure 6 presents the main result of the paper where we show that the photon
index Γ (α+1) is around 2 while the CC plasma temperature is less than 30 keV. Note,
that the applied electron cross-section is Thomson in this case. However, when the CC
plasma temperature increases above 30 keV the electron cross-section drops and thus, the
critical luminosity increases.
In this case, kTe > 30 keV, the emergent luminosity is less
than the critical and thus, the radiation pressure originated at the NS surface cannot stop
the accretion ﬂow.

Note, 4U 1700-37 HID is similar to those of LMXBs while the CCD is diﬀerent. Thus,
we can conclude that 4U 1700-37 behaves in the same way as a NS in LMXB in terms of
physical quantities (the spectral index and the CC plasma temperature) keeping, however in
mind that CCD is only a qualitative description of the data. Indeed, our Figure 2 presents

– 17 –

clearly the spectral softening when the count rate increases.

One possible issue for the presented study is that the magnetic ﬁeld which can be as high
as normal X-ray pulsar, see aforementioned claims using the data analysis of the appropriate
BeppoSAX observations [Reynolds et al. (1999) and Jaisawal & Naik, 2015]. The absence of
pulsations from this source even leads to a suggestion that the source could be a BH source.
In fact, we have found using our analysis that the illumination factor of the Compton cloud,
f is very close to 1 (or log A ≫ 1) in most of the observations. This means that the NS is
embedded in a thick Compton cloud that does not allow a direct view of the NS surface,
making diﬃcult to estimate the NS magnetic ﬁeld.

5. Conclusions

Applying Suzaku, BeppoSAX, and RXTE observations we studied the correlations of
˙M observed in the non-pulsating high mass

spectral properties, with mass accretion rate,
binary, 4U 1700-37.

We ﬁnd that all broad-band energy spectra of this source can be adequately presented
as a sum of two Comptonization spectra associated with the seed photon temperatures,
Ts1 ∼ 1.3 − 2 keV and Ts2 = 0.8 − 1.1 keV. We also put an iron-line component to the model.

Our model of the 4U 1700-37 spectra allows us to separate the contributions
of two speciﬁc spectra, related to the hard and soft X-ray components along the
CCD and HID presumably dictated by ˙M . The observed luminosity determined
by two normalizations NCom1 and NCom2 of the Comptonized components which
are proportional to ˙M . We also found that the soft Comptonization component
(associated with the NS seed photons) dominates over the hard Comptonization
component (associated with the disk seed photons). This eﬀect is clearly visible
in the second panel from the bottom in Figure 1.

During X-ray ﬂares, in a surge of
rise of the plasma temperature kT (2)

e

˙M , we observe an increase of NCom2 correlated with a
(see 2nd and 3rd panels from the bottom of Figure 1).

e

from 2 keV to 30 keV, while a drop of Γ2 is seen during a rise of kT (2)

Our spectral analysis of 4U 1700-37 also discovers the stability of photon indices Γ1
and Γ2 around 2 during the states which relate to the CC plasma temperature range of
kT (2)
e > 40 keV (see
Figure 6). We interpret the quasi-stability of Γ around 2 in the framework of a model in
which the gravitational energy release occurs in the transition layer (TL) and this energy
deposition in the TL greatly exceeds that in the disk. The similar eﬀect was previously

– 18 –

revealed in LMXBs: atolls, 4U 1705-44, 4U 1728-34, GX 3+1, 4U 1820-30 and Z-sources,
Sco X-1, GX 340+0 (see Figure 7). In addition to the index plateau phase of Γ1,2 ∼ 2 we
also reveal the index decrease for the hard Comptonization component detected over the
ﬂaring branch (FB), in addition to the index plateau stage of Γ ∼ 2. Note, that a similar
phase is observed in 4U 1705-44 over the upper banana branch and in Sco X-1 at the FB
which is an additional argument for the NS presense in 4U 1700-37.

We can interpret this index decrease using the model in which the gravitational energy
release occurs only in an outer part of the Compton cloud (CC) (see details in TSS14).
The radiation force acting on the accretion ﬂow stops it near the inner boundary of the CC
where Te is actually dictated by the photon ﬂux from the NS surface and as a result the
Klien-Nishina cross-section rises with a plasma temperature decrease (see §4 of TSS14 for
details).

Note, in BHs the photon index rises and then saturates when the luminosity increases
(see e.g. ST09). This index behavior in a BH is in contrast to that seen in 4U 1700-37,
4U 1705 and Sco X-1.

In our analysis we establish the robust nature of the parameter correlations in 4U 1700-

37 and we want to point out that this source is a neutron star one.

We appreciate editing the text of the paper by Demos Kazanas and his valuable sug-
gestions which improve the paper presentation. We should acknowledge hot discussion of
the paper results with Sergio Campana (see Discussion section for details). We also want to
acknowledge the referees eﬀorts on the clear presentation of our paper.

Fig. 2.— CCDs (left panel) and HIDs (right panel) for observations of 4U 1700-37 used
in our analysis, with bin size 16 s. The typical error bars for the colors are shown in the
right bottom corner of the left panel while errors of the intensity are negligible. The sets
are indicated by diﬀerent colors: red (ObsId 10148-01-01-000), blue (ObsId 10148-01-02-00),
bright blue (ObsId 10148-01-03-000), green (ObsI 30094-01-01-00), crimson (ObsId 30094-01-
02-00), yellow (ObsId 30094-01-03-00) and black (ObsIds 30094-01-04-00, 30094-01-05-00).

Fig.
4.— On the spectral model choice for 4U 1700-37 using RXTE observation
(ObsId=10148-01-02-00; 1996, September 13). Left: the spectrum along with the ﬁt residu-
als for the model ﬁt, phabs*(bbody+comptb+gauss), which includes a single Comptb com-
ponent (χ2
red = 12.3 for 86 dof), and right: the best-ﬁt spectrum and ∆χ for the model
ﬁt, phabs*(bbody+comptb1+comptb2+gauss), which consists of two Comptb components
(χ2
red = 1.12 for 81 dof). The data are shown by crosses and the best-ﬁt spectral model is pre-
sented by light-blue line. The model components are indicated by dark-blue, red, green and
crimson lines for Blackbody, Comptb1, Comptb2 and Gaussian components, respectively.

Fig. 6.— The photon indices Γ1 and Γ2 plotted versus the best-ﬁt seed photon kTs (left) and
electron kTe (right) temperatures of the Comptb1 and Comptb2 components, respectively,
measured in keV (see also Tables 5-6). Blue and red points correspond to Comptb1 and
Comptb2 components, respectively, which are related to the thermal Comptonization of the
soft photons by plasma (electrons) in the Compton cloud.
