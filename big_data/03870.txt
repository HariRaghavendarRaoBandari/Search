Recent measurements of spin Hall eﬀect (SHE) in chemically treated graphene, reporting un-
expectedly large charge-to-spin conversion eﬃciency, have raised a ﬁerce controversy. Here, using
eﬃcient implementations of numerically exact Kubo and Landauer-B¨uttiker formulas, we analyze
the SH conductivity, the nonlocal resistance and the SH angle for realistic disordered models of
gold-decorated graphene. Similar large SH angles of (cid:39) 0.1 are obtained with both methods at
zero-temperature, but decrease by one order of magnitude at room temperature, whereas adatom
segregation is found to be detrimental for large SHE signal. Our ﬁndings also conﬁrm the existence
of surprisingly large nonlocal resistance in disordered graphene, even in the absence of spin-orbit
interaction, and suggest ways to clarify the experimental debate.

Introduction.—Over the past decade, the spin Hall ef-
fect (SHE) has evolved rapidly from an obscure theoret-
ical prediction to a major resource for spintronics [1–3].
In the direct SHE, injection of conventional unpolarized
charge current into a material with extrinsic (due to im-
purities) or intrinsic (due to band structure) spin-orbit
coupling (SOC) generates pure spin current in the di-
rection transverse to charge current. Although SHE was
ﬁrst observed only a decade ago [4], it is already ubiq-
uitous within spintronics as standard pure spin-current
generator and detector [5, 6]. The ratio of the spin Hall
current to the charge current, i.e., spin Hall angle (θsH)
is the ﬁgure of merit of charge to spin current conversion
eﬃciency. To date, measured values of θsH range from
∼ 10−4 for semiconductors [4, 7] to 0.1 for metals such
as Au, Ta, Pt or β-W [8, 9].

On the other side, the discovery of graphene [10]
has been followed by a considerable amount of activ-
ity, owing to its unique electronic properties and ver-
satility for practical applications, including spintronics
[11, 12]. The intrinsically small SOC and hyperﬁne in-
teractions in graphene lead to spin relaxation lengths
reaching several tens of micrometers at room tempera-
ture [13–17], but simultaneously making clean graphene
inactive for SHE. Recently, by decorating graphene with
heavy metal adatoms like copper, gold, silver or ﬂuorine
(locally enhancing SOC), Balakrishnan and coworkers
have reported one of the largest values of θsH (cid:39) 0.2 ever
measured [18, 19]. Besides, similar values were also sur-
prisingly obtained using weak hydrogenation [20]. These

large values of θsH are supported by semiclassical trans-
port analysis [21, 22].

However, those ﬁndings have raised a lot of debate,
ﬁrst at the experimental side with contradictory ﬁndings
obtained for both hydrogenated or functionalized (with
metallic adatoms) graphene, in which large nonlocal re-
sistance signals were also oberved but apparently discon-
nected from SHE physics [23, 24]. Wang and coworkers
[23] reported that Au- or Ir- decorated graphene exhibit
no signature of SHE, and relate the measured large non-
local resistance (RNL) to the formation of neutral Hall
currents, whereas Kaverzin and van Wees found large
RNL signal in hydrogenated graphene, however insensi-
tive to an applied in-plane magnetic ﬁeld [24]. The au-
thors exclude valley Hall eﬀect and long-range chargeless
valley currents as mediating such RNL, given the absence
of both temperature dependence and broken inversion
symmetry [25–28], and conclude that a nontrivial phe-
nomenon is at play.

Additionally, the theoretical interpretation of a largely
enhanced SOC (estimated about 2.5 meV) by hydrogen
defects [20] is contradicted by ab-initio calculations [29],
for which SOC is one order of magnitude smaller, and
spin lifetime very short owing to the magnetic resonant
mechanism [30]. Besides, the presently available theories
for θsH [21] or RNL [31] oﬀer little guidance on how to
resolve these controversies since they utilize semiclassical
approaches to charge transport and spin relaxation which
are known to break down [32, 33] near the charge neutral-
ity point (CNP). Additionally, while Kubo formula [34]

oﬀers fully quantum-mechanical treatment that can in
principle capture all relevant eﬀects, its standard analyt-
ical evaluation neglects [35] terms in the perturbative ex-
pansion in disorder strength which can become crucial for
clusters of adatoms (such as those corresponding to skew-
scattering from pairs of closely spaced impurities [36]).
Finally the impact of unavoidable adatom clustering [37]
onto graphene surface on θsH is an open and important
question, since adatom segregation has been shown to
strongly aﬀect spin transport properties [38, 39].

In this Letter, the SH angles in graphene decorated by
Au-adatoms are computed by using numerically exact
quantum transport theory, namely the Kubo transport
method and the multiterminal Landauer-B¨uttiker (LB)
approach. At zero temperature, conventional approxi-
mations made for the SH Kubo conductivity (σsH) yield
to SH angles typically in the order of θsH ∼ 0.1−0.3, simi-
lar to the semiclassical estimates and experimental values
[18, 21]. Nonlocal transport simulations, via the LB ap-
proach, also conﬁrm, for the same density of adsorbed
Au impurities, similar values for θsH. However, those
values drop when surface adatom clustering is taken into
account, whereas temperature eﬀects reduce θsH by up to
one order of magnitude, consistently with the decrease of
RNL. Moreover, RNL of similar value to the case with
θsH (cid:54)= 0 is found even when SOC is artiﬁcially turned oﬀ
while keeping random spin-independent potential due to
adatoms.

Hamiltonian model

for gold-decorated graphene.—
When an adatom like gold, thallium or indium is ab-
sorbed onto graphene surface, it places in the hollow sites
of graphene carbon rings and induces both the intrinsic
type VI and Rashba SOC VR on carbon atoms in these
rings due to the broken inversion symmetry [40]. The
π-π* orthogonal tight-binding model for graphene under
the eﬀect of such kind of adatoms reads

The ﬁrst term is the nearest neighbor hopping term with

bor hopping term which represents the intrinsic SOC in-
duced by the adatoms. (cid:126)dkj is the unit vector pointing
from atom i to atom k, with atom k standing in between
i and j, and (cid:126)s is a vector deﬁned by the Pauli matri-
ces (sx, sy, sz). The third term describes the Rashba
SOC which explicitly violates (cid:126)z → −(cid:126)z symmetry. The
last term is the potential shift µ associated to the car-
bon atoms in the hexagonal rings R containing adatoms,
simulating some charge modulation induced very locally
around the adatom [40]. Such model has been employed
to study spin dynamics in graphene [32]. Here we take
the same parameters VI = 0.007γ0, VR = 0.0165γ0 and

Kubo formula, we use a graphene region of the size
400 nm × 400 nm enclosed in dashed square (with pe-
riodic boundary conditions). For LB calculations of RNL
and θsH = I sz

width W = 50 nm and with variable distance L between
the pair of electrodes 1 and 2 and the pair of electrodes
3 and 4. This mimics the experimental circuit used in
Ref. [18, 20, 23, 24]

ries to ﬁnite order M [41]. The trace in µmn is computed
by the average on a small number R (cid:28) N of random
phase vectors |ϕ(cid:105). Hereafter M = 1500 (resp. 6000) for
σsH (resp. σxx), R = 1, N = 4 × 106. Similar real-space
methods have been developed for the longitudinal con-
ductivity σxx [42], Hall conductivity σxy [43, 44] and SH
conductivity σsH [45]. The method is here validated for
both intrinsic and Rashba SOC clean cases by compari-
son with prior studies in the quantum spin Hall regime
(where σsH = e/2π) and with analytical derivations [46]
(Supplemental information [47]).

Clustering eﬀect on spin Hall angles.—Figure 2 shows
σsH (main frame) for 15% of Au adatoms distributed in
two diﬀerent manners, namely as scattered distributions
and clustered coverages, deﬁned by randomly distributed
islands of radius ∈ [1, 3] nm. Although the random dis-
tribution of Au impurities (and related Rashba SOC and
ﬁeld) induce scattering [µ = 0.1γ0 in Eq.(1)], in absence
of intrinsic SOC, the energy proﬁle of σsH is reminiscent
from the typical step behavior obtained for an homoge-
neous Rashba ﬁeld [47], with a characteristic value of
σsH (cid:39) ±e/4π near half ﬁlling. Adding a small intrinsic
SOC (VI = 0.007γ0 (cid:28) VR) slightly changes the absolute
value of σsH but preserves the step behavior.

In contrast, the clustered distribution of Au adatoms
destroys the step behavior and smoothen the shape of σsH
close to CNP, a fact showing that clustering eﬀectively
decreases the Rashba SOC eﬀect. The eﬀect of intrinsic
SOC is more pronounced for the clustered distribution
with a more signiﬁcant enhancement of σsH on both elec-
tron and hole sides. One notes that the magnitude of
SH conductivity close to CNP for the scattered case is
larger than one for clustered case, another evidence of
the detrimental eﬀect of clustering on SHE in graphene.
The SH angle θsH = σsH/σxx requires the calculation
of the longitudinal conductivity σxx, which is also per-
formed using a real space Kubo approach [47]. Figure
2 (insets) shows σxx for both cases. Comparable values
of σxx are obtained at CNP for two cases, but for the
scattered case, σxx increases with energy faster than for
the clustered case. Figure 3 shows θsH for 15% of Au
adatoms on graphene surface distributed homogeneously
(black line) or into islands (red line). Remarkably, the
value of θsH is very large, in the order of few 0.1 close
to CNP, which is similar to the experimental values [18]
and semiclassical transport estimates [21]. Furthermore,
a threefold decrease in θsH is obtained close to CNP when
adatoms are segregated into islands with small radius,

Nonlocal charge transport and SHE.—In SHE experi-
ments [18, 20], a multiterminal graphene transport con-
ﬁguration is used as illustrated in Fig. 1.
In such a
circuit, charge current I1 injected from lead 1 towards
lead 2 generates nonlocal resistance RNL = (V3 − V4)/I1
for the Fermi energy EF tuned within the some interval
around the CNP. The appearance of non-zero RNL is ex-
plained by charge current I1 inducing spin current I S in
the ﬁrst crossbar in Fig. 1 ﬂowing in the direction 5 → 6,
which is subsequently converted into the nonlocal voltage
VNL = V3−V4 by the inverse SHE in the second crossbar.
The exponential decay of RNL ∝ e−L/λs with the chan-
nel length L is governed by the characteristic length λs
that is comparable to the spin-relaxation length ((cid:39) 150

for the chosen cluster conﬁguration. This originates from
the larger RNL for the case of scattered Au adatoms in
Fig. 4 (left panel). While both Kubo and LB calcula-
tions predict large value of SH angle close to the CNP
θsH (cid:39) 0.1, thermal broadening eﬀects obtained in LB
calculations reduce θsH by about one order of magnitude.
We observe that by using the Kubo formula, calculations
are eﬀectively performed in thermodynamic limit by av-
eraging local nonconserved spin current over the whole
sample, while LB calculations are performed for a ﬁnite
size system attached to external leads where spin cur-
rent is deﬁned as conserved quantity [50, 51]. Those dif-
ferences are however not jeopardizing the possibility to
measure sizable SHE using metal adatom functionaliza-
tion, but indicate strong variability of θsH upon adatom
segregation and varying temperature. By comparing Fig.
4 with Fig.S2 in [47], we ﬁnd that the hypothetical case
of an homogeneous SOC, with Au adatoms covering uni-
formly every hexagon in Fig. 1, generates an intrinsic
SHE with θsH vs. EF exhibiting wider peak (centered
at 0.3 γ0 due to doping of graphene by Au adatoms) of
slightly smaller magnitude than in the case of randomly
scattered Au adatoms (covering 15% of hexagons). Thus,
adatom induced resonances at the CNP play a crucial role
in generating large spin Hall current and nonlocal voltage
RNL, as observed experimentally [18, 20].

Bulk and multiterminal calculations found a consistent
decrease of θsH when switching from scattered (i.e., iso-
lated) to clustered Au adatoms. Also interestingly, our
current prediction can be contrasted with the onset of
SHE found in the case of thallium (Tl) segregation [39].
Heavier adatoms such as Tl locally induce large intrin-
sic SOC and negligible contribution of the Rashba SOC
[40]. For large density and uniform distribution, a quan-
tum spin Hall eﬀect (QSHE) is expected [40] followed by
a crossover from a QSHE to SHE upon Tl segregation
[39]. The formation of SHE for Tl adatoms is here con-
ﬁrmed, but with a larger θsH compared to Au-adatoms
[47]. Finally, we show that a non-zero RNL is obtained
when switching oﬀ all SOC-terms (VR = VI = 0), while
keeping the other disorder potential terms of the Hamil-
tonian unchanged (see Fig 4, left inset). This value of
RNL is comparable to the one in the presence of SHE,
and it cannot be accounted by the trivial Ohmic con-
tribution (expected to decay faster ∝ (−πL/W ) with L
[31]). This observation suggests that another nonlocal
transport mechanism is at play in disordered graphene,
but we exclude valley currents [25–28] in absence of en-
ergy bandgap.

Our ﬁndings allow to revisit the controversy generated
in recent experiments [18, 20, 23, 24], suggesting vari-
ous ways to clarify the existence adatom-induced SHE
physics by controlling the impact of adatom segregation,
performing temperature-dependent studies and analyz-
ing how the nonlocal resistance signals change with the
channel length. The quest is to establish how spin-driven

[32]. We note that such exponential damping is used to
support the SHE interpretation in Ref.

[18, 20].

We compute the total spin and charge currents in a
multiterminal geometry via the LB formula [48] imple-
mented in the KWANT package [49]. The generic formula
q Gpq(Vp − Vq) connects the total charge cur-
rent Ip, ﬂowing through semi-inﬁnite ideal (i.e., with-
out impurities or SOC) graphene lead p =1–6 attached
to the central region decorated with Au adatoms, with
voltages Vq in all other leads. The charge conduc-

One applies the equation for Ip to the circuit in Fig. 1
by either setting the voltages Vq to ﬁnd currents Ip and
I sα
p , or ﬁx the injected current Ip and then ﬁnd voltages
Vq which develop as the response to it. For the analysis
of experiments reported in Ref. [18, 20, 23, 24] the latter
approach is the most suitable, so we set injected charge
current I1 through lead 1 and current −I1 ﬂows through
lead 2 while Ip ≡ 0 in the other four leads. We then
compute voltages which develop in the leads p =3–6 in
response to injected current I1 and obtain the nonlocal
resistance RNL.

In Fig. 4 (right panel), the large values of θsH obtained
by the Kubo formula are conﬁrmed by LB calculations, as
well as the detrimental eﬀect of clustering of Au adatoms
which signiﬁcantly reduces θsH, by at least a factor of 2
