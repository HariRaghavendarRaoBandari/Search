ON TANGENT CONES AT INFINITY OF ALGEBRAIC VARIETIES

Abstract. In this paper, we establish the following version at inﬁnity of Whitney’s theo-

rem [7, 8]: Geometric and algebraic tangent cones at inﬁnity of complex algebraic varieties

coincide. The proof of this fact is based on a geometric characterization of geometric tan-

gent cones at inﬁnity and using the global  Lojasiewicz inequality with explicit exponents

for complex algebraic varieties. We also show that tangent cones at inﬁnity of complex

algebraic varieties can be computed using Gr¨obner bases.

1. Introduction

Let V ⊂ (Cn, 0) be an analytic variety in some neighborhood of the origin 0 in Cn. In his
seminal papers [7, 8], Whitney showed (among other results) that geometric and algebraic

tangent cones of V at 0 coincide. The aim of this paper is to give a version at inﬁnity of this

result for complex algebraic varieties.

In order to state our main result, we need some notation. Let V ⊂ Cn be an algebraic
variety. The geometric tangent cone Cg,∞(V ) of V at inﬁnity is deﬁned by the set of “tangent”
vectors, in the sense that v ∈ Cg,∞(V ) if, and only if, there exist a sequence {xk}k∈N ⊂
V, kxkk → ∞, and a sequence of numbers {tk}k∈N ⊂ C such that tkxk → v. By the algebraic
tangent cone Ca,∞(V ) of V at inﬁnity we mean the set

Ca,∞(V ) := {v ∈ Cn | f ∗(v) = 0 for all f ∈ I(V )} ,

where I(V ) denotes the ideal deﬁning V , and for each polynomial f ∈ I(V ), f ∗ denotes its
homogeneous component of highest degree.

The main result of this paper can be formulated as follows.

Theorem 1.1. Let V ⊂ Cn be an algebraic variety. Then Ca,∞(V ) = Cg,∞(V ).

Example 1.1. Let V := {(x, y) ∈ C2 | x2 − y3 = 0}. We have

Ca,∞(V ) = Cg,∞(V ) = {y = 0}.

Remark 1.1. The proof for Theorem 1.1 is diﬀerent from the one given in [8, Theorem 10.6].
In fact, the proof of the inclusion Cg,∞(V ) ⊆ Ca,∞(V ) is rather straightforward (Lemma 2.3),
while the proof of the converse one will follow from a geometric characterization of geometric

tangent cones at inﬁnity (Lemma 2.4) and the global  Lojasiewicz inequality with explicit

exponents for algebraic varieties (Lemma 2.5).

The paper is organized as follows. The proof of Theorem 1.1 will be given in Section 2.

Then in Section 3, using Gr¨obner bases, we compute tangent cones at inﬁnity of algebraic

varieties.

2. Proof of Theorem 1.1

Let V ⊂ Cn be an algebraic variety. By deﬁnition, we can verify that the sets Cg,∞(V )
and Ca,∞(V ) are closed cones in Cn with the vertex at the origin 0 ∈ Cn, i.e.
for every
element v ∈ C∞(V ) and for every λ ∈ C, we have λv ∈ C∞(V ), where C∞(V ) denotes for
both Cg,∞(V ) and Ca,∞(V ). Moreover, the following properties of these cones are obtained
easily from their deﬁnitions.

Lemma 2.1. For any two algebraic varieties V and W in Cn, the following properties hold:

(i) C∞(W ) ⊆ C∞(V ) if W ⊆ V ;
(ii) C∞(V ∪ W ) = C∞(V ) ∪ C∞(W );
(iii) C∞(V ∩ W ) ⊆ C∞(V ) ∩ C∞(W ).

Remark 2.1. In general we cannot replace “⊆” by “=” in (iii).
Indeed, let us consider
the algebraic varieties V and W in C2 deﬁned respectively by x = 0 and y − x2 = 0. Then
C∞(V ) = C∞(W ) = {x = 0}, while C∞(V ∩ W ) = {0}. Hence in this case, C∞(V ∩ W )  
C∞(V ) ∩ C∞(W ).

The following statement shows that tangent vectors to V at inﬁnity may be deﬁned by

analytic curves (compare [6, Proposition 2] and [8, Theorem 11.8]).

Lemma 2.2. Let V ⊂ Cn be an algebraic variety. Then, for each nonzero vector v ∈
Cg,∞(V ), there exists an analytic curve ϕ : (0, ǫ) → Cn (ǫ > 0) with ϕ(s) ∈ V for all
s ∈ (0, ǫ), such that

lim
s→0+

kϕ(s)k = +∞ and

lim
s→0+

ϕ(s)
kϕ(s)k

= − lim
s→0+

ϕ′(s)
kϕ′(s)k

=

v
kvk

.

Proof. Indeed, let v be a nonzero vector in Cg,∞(V ). By deﬁnition, there exist a sequence
{xk}k∈N ⊂ V, kxkk → ∞, and a sequence of numbers {tk}k∈N ⊂ C such that tkxk → v.
In view of the Curve Selection Lemma at inﬁnity (see [2, 5]), there exist analytic curves
ψ := (ψ1, . . . , ψn) : (0, ǫ) → Cn and t : (0, ǫ) → C, for some ǫ > 0, such that

2

(a) ψ(s) ∈ V for all s ∈ (0, ǫ);
(b) lims→0+ kψ(s)k = +∞;
(c) lims→0+ t(s)ψ(s) = v.

Since v 6= 0, we have that t(s) 6≡ 0, and so we can write

t(s) = asp + higher terms in s,

for some a ∈ C, with a 6= 0, and p ∈ Z. Let J := {j | ψj(t) 6≡ 0} 6= ∅. For each j ∈ J we can
write

ψj(s) = bjsqj + higher terms in s,

for some bj ∈ C, with bj 6= 0, and qj ∈ Z. It follows from conditions (b) and (c) that

Let λ ∈ C be such that λ−p = a and we may regard ψ as an analytic curve from the disc
{s ∈ C | |s| < ǫ} to Cn. Deﬁne the curve ϕ : (0, ǫ/|λ|) → Cn by ϕ(s) := ψ(λs). Then, by
condition (a), ϕ(s) ∈ V for all s ∈ (0, ǫ/|λ|). Furthermore, we have

kϕ(s)k = cs−p + higher terms in s

for some real number c > 0. Finally, a direct computation shows that

Remark 2.2. By Lemma 2.2, it will not alter the deﬁnition of the cone Cg,∞(V ) if we require
that the tk be real and positive. In particular, v ∈ Cg,∞(V ) \ {0} if, and only if, there exists
a sequence {xk}k∈N ⊂ V such that

lim
k→∞

kxkk = +∞ and

lim
k→∞

Lemma 2.3. Let V ⊂ Cn be an algebraic variety. Then Cg,∞(V ) ⊆ Ca,∞(V ).

Proof. We ﬁrst consider the case where V is a hypersurface deﬁned by a polynomial f ∈
C[x1, . . . , xn]. We can write

where d := deg f and each fi is homogeneous polynomial of degree i.

f = fd + fd−1 + · · · + f0,

3

Take any non-zero vector v ∈ Cg,∞(V ). By Lemma 2.2, there exists a sequence {xk}k∈N ⊂

V such that

lim
k→∞

kxkk = +∞ and

lim
k→∞

xk
kxkk

v

.

For k suﬃciently large we have kxkk > 0 and hence

0 = f (xk) = f (cid:18)kxkk

Letting k → ∞ yields fd(v) = 0, i.e. v ∈ Ca,∞(V ).

Now let V be any algebraic variety in Cn and v ∈ Cg,∞(V ). Take any f ∈ I(V ). We
have V ⊆ V(f ) := {x ∈ Cn | f (x) = 0}, and so, by Lemma 2.1(i), Cg,∞(V ) ⊆ Cg,∞(V(f )).
It follows from the hypersurface case considered above that v ∈ Ca,∞(V(f )). Note that
Ca,∞(V(f )) = {w ∈ Cn | fd(w) = 0}. Therefore, fd(v) = 0. Since f is arbitrary, v ∈ Ca,∞(V ).
The proof is complete.
(cid:3)

In order to show the reverse inclusion Cg,∞(V ) ⊇ Ca,∞(V ), we need the following geometric

characterization of the cone Cg,∞(V ).

Lemma 2.4. Let V ⊂ Cn be an algebraic variety and let v be a non-zero vector in Cn. Then
v ∈ Cg,∞(V ) if and only if there exists a sequence {tk}k∈N of positive real numbers such that

lim
k→∞

tk = +∞ and

lim
k→∞

dist(tkv, V )

tk

= 0,

where dist(x, V ) denotes the usual Euclidean distance from a point x ∈ Cn to the variety V.

Proof. ⇒ Assume that v ∈ Cg,∞(V ). By Lemma 2.2, there exists a sequence {xk}k∈N ⊂ V
such that

lim
k→∞

kxkk = +∞ and

lim
k→∞

xk
kxkk

v

Then we may assume that tk := kxkk

kvk > 0 for all k ∈ N. We have limk→∞ tk = +∞ and

⇐ Conversely, assume there exists a sequence {tk}k∈N of positive real numbers such that

For each k ∈ N, let xk be a point in V such that dist(tkv, V ) = ktkv − xkk (such a point

does always exist because V is a closed set in the usual topology on Cn). Then

v −

Let V ⊂ Cn be an algebraic variety of dimension k. It is well-known that, for any generic
(n−k)-dimensional linear subspace P in Cn, the set V ∩P is ﬁnite, and its cardinality is called
the degree of V and denoted by deg(V ). In particular, if V = V(f ) := {x ∈ Cn | f (x) = 0}
is a hypersurface deﬁned by a complex polynomial f of degree d, then deg(V ) = d. The

following lemma will be useful in the sequel.

Lemma 2.5 ([4, Lemma 8]). Let V ⊂ Cn be an irreducible algebraic variety of degree d.
Then there are ﬁnitely many polynomials gi, i = 1, . . . , s, of degree at most d vanishing on V
and a constant c > 0 such that

dist(x, V )d ≤ c max
i=1,...,s

{|gi(x)|}

for all

x ∈ Cn.

We are now ready to complete the proof of Theorem 1.1.

Proof of Theorem 1.1. By Lemma 2.3, we have Cg,∞(V ) ⊆ Ca,∞(V ). Hence, it remains to
show the reverse inclusion.

We ﬁrst remark that it suﬃces to prove the inclusion Ca,∞(V ) ⊆ Cg,∞(V ) for the case
where the variety V is irreducible. Indeed, if V1, . . . , Vr are irreducible components of V , and
assume that we have proved that Cg,∞(Vi) = Ca,∞(Vi) for every i, then by Lemma 2.1(ii) we
have

Cg,∞(V ) =

r

[i=1

Cg,∞(Vi) =

r

[i=1

Ca,∞(Vi) = Ca,∞(V ).

5

Therefore, we may now assume that V is irreducible of degree d. By Lemma 2.5, there
exist ﬁnitely many polynomials gi, i = 1, . . . , s, of degree at most d vanishing on V and a
constant c > 0 such that for all x ∈ Cn we have

dist(x, V )d ≤ c max
i=1,...,s

{|gi(x)|}.

Let v be a non-zero vector in Ca,∞(V ). Since V ⊆ V(gi) for every i = 1, . . . , s, by

Lemma 2.1(i) we have Ca,∞(V ) ⊆ Ca,∞(V(gi)), and so v ∈ Ca,∞(V(gi)). Hence

(gi)di(v) = 0,

for all

i = 1, . . . , s,

(1)

where (gi)di denotes the homogeneous component of gi of degree di := deg gi.

Now let {tk}k∈N be a sequence of positive real numbers such that limk→∞ tk = +∞. It
follows from (1) that for every i = 1, . . . , s, there exists a positive constant ci such that for
all k suﬃciently large,

Since di := deg gi ≤ d for i = 1, . . . , s, we obtain for all k suﬃciently large,

|gi(tkv)| ≤ citdi−1

i=1,...,s

{|gi(tkv)|} ≤ c′td−1

where c′ := maxi=1,...,s ci > 0. Therefore

By letting k → ∞, we get

Hence v ∈ Cg,∞(V ) by Lemma 2.4. The proof of the theorem is complete.

3. Computations

In this section, given an algebraic variety V ⊂ Cn, we shall compute the tangent cone at

inﬁnity C∞(V ) := Ca,∞(V ) = Cg,∞(V ) of V by using Gr¨obner bases.

If I(V ) = hf i ⊂ C[x1, . . . , xn], then it is easy to see that

C∞(V ) = V(f ∗) := {v ∈ Cn | f ∗(v) = 0}.

(Recall that f ∗ stands for the homogeneous component of highest degree of f .) However, if
I(V ) = hf1, . . . , fri has more generators, then it need not follow that

C∞(V ) = V(f ∗

1 , . . . , f ∗

r ) := {v ∈ Cn | f ∗

1 (v) = · · · = f ∗

r (v) = 0}.

6

For example, let V ⊂ C3 be deﬁned by the ideal generated by polynomials

f1 := xy

and

f2 := z(x3 − y2 + z2).

We have f ∗

1 = xy, f ∗

2 = x3z, and

V(f ∗

1 , f ∗

2 ) = {x = 0} ∪ {y = z = 0}.

Consider the polynomial f ∈ C[x, y, z] deﬁned by

f (x, y, z) := yz(y2 − z2) = zx2f1 − yf2.

We see that f ∗ = f vanishes on C∞(V ), however f ∗ does not vanish on V(f ∗
that C∞(V ) 6= V(f ∗

1 , f ∗

2 ).

1 , f ∗

2 ). It follows

We can overcome this diﬃculty by using an appropriate Gr¨obner basis for the ideal deﬁning
V . In order to compute the ideal deﬁning the cone C∞(V ) we need the following notation.
For a polynomial f ∈ C[x1, . . . , xn] of degree d, its homogenization f h is a polynomial in

C[x0, x1, . . . , xn] deﬁned by

f h(x0, x1, . . . , xn) := xd

0f (cid:18)x1

x0

, . . . ,

xn

x0(cid:19) ,

where x0 is a new variable. For an ideal I in the ring C[x1, . . . , xn], its homogenization is the
ideal

For any g ∈ C[x0, x1, . . . , xn], let

I h := (cid:10)f h | f ∈ I(cid:11) ⊂ C[x0, x1, . . . , xn].

g|x0=0 := g(0, x1, . . . , xn) ∈ C[x1, . . . , xn].

Following [3] we deﬁne

Lemma 3.1. Let V ⊂ Cn be an algebraic variety and let I := I(V ). Then

I∞ := (cid:10)g|x0=0 | g ∈ I h(cid:11) ⊂ C[x1, . . . , xn].

C∞(V ) = V(I∞).

Proof. Let us take any x = (x1, . . . , xn) ∈ C∞(V ) and f ∈ I∞. Then there exists g ∈ I such
that f = gh|x0=0. Decomposing g into homogeneous components as

where d is the degree of g, we have

g = g0 + g1 + · · · + gd,

gh = g0xd

0 + g1xd−1

0 + · · · + gd−1x0 + gd ∈ C[x0, x1, . . . , xn].

It follows that

f = gh|x0=0 = gd = g∗.

7

By deﬁnition of C∞(V ) = Ca,∞(V ), we have f (x) = g∗(x) = 0, and so x ∈ V(I∞). Therefore,
C∞(V ) ⊆ V(I∞).

Conversely, let us take any x ∈ V(I∞) and f ∈ I. Assume we decompose f into homoge-

neous components as

where e is the degree of f. Then

f = f0 + f1 + · · · + fe,

f h = f0xe

0 + f1xe−1

0 + · · · + fe−1x0 + fe ∈ I h.

It follows that

fe = f h|x0=0 ∈ I∞.

By deﬁnition of V(I∞), therefore f ∗(x) = fe(x) = 0. It follows that x ∈ Ca,∞(V ) = C∞(V ).
The proof is complete.
(cid:3)

By [3, Lemma A.4.15], the variety V(I∞) ⊂ Cn equals to the so-called part at inﬁnity of
V. Hence, it follows from Lemma 3.1 and the remark after [3, Lemma A.4.15] the following
computation for C∞(V ) = V(I∞).

Corollary 3.1. Let V ⊂ Cn be an algebraic variety. Let {g1, . . . , gk} be a Gr¨obner basis for
I(V ) with respect to a degree ordering, then

C∞(V ) = V(gh

1 |x0=0, . . . , gh

k |x0=0).

Example 3.1. Let us compute the tangent cone at inﬁnity of the algebraic variety V ⊂ C3
deﬁned by the ideal I ⊂ C[x, y, z] generated by polynomials f1 := xy and f2 := z(x3 −y2+z2)
as considered at the beginning of this section.

It is easy to compute a Gr¨obner basis for I with respect to a degree ordering is

{g1 = xy,

g2 = x3z − y2z + z3,

g3 = yz(y2 − z2)}.

The homogenization of these polynomials by a new variable t in the polynomial ring C[x, y, z, t]:

gh
1 = xy,

gh
2 = x3z − y2zt + z3t,

gh
3 = yz(y2 − z2).

Substituting t = 0, using Corollary 3.1, we have

C∞(V ) = V(xy, x3z, yz(y2 − z2)),

which is a union of 5 lines through the origin in C3.
