We calculate the root-mean-square radii for a three-body system in two dimensions compounded
by two identical bosons (A) and a distinguishable particle (B). We use a pairwise Dirac-delta
potential in order to study the universal regime. For a B/A mass ratio of 0.01 the system displays
eight three-body bound states, which one by one disappears into the continuum as the mass ratio is
increased, and eventually leaving only the ground and the ﬁrst excited states. Energies and radii of
the states for small mass ratios can be understood by use of the Coulomb-like Born-Oppenheimer
potential at small distances where the lowest-lying of these states are located. For large mass ratio
the radii of the two remaining bound states are consistent with a slightly asymmetric three-body
structure. We found that the radii diverge at the mass ratio threshold where the three-body excited
states disappear. The divergences are linear in the inverse energy deviations from the corresponding
two-body thresholds.

INTRODUCTION

Recently, the study of few-body correlations has received a special attention due to the possibility of changing
the two-body interactions inside ultracold atomic traps by using Feshbach resonance techniques[1]. The experimental
realization of such traps also allows the construction of a quasi two-dimensional (2D) environment[2, 3] where, in many
situations, the physics involved diﬀers considerably from the three-dimensional (3D) case [4, 5]. In the case of diluted
atomic gases compounded by neutral atoms the interactions between them are of very short range compared to the
two-body scattering length [6–8]. This implies that the (low-energy) observables are universal: they do not depend
on the details of the interaction [9, 10]. In order to study this universal regime we employ a zero-range interaction.

The universal regime can be described by only a few scale-parameters [11, 12]. Furthermore, in a three-boson
system the number of these scales is drastically aﬀected by the dimensionality of the system. In 3D, we need both a
two- and a three-body scale to describe the observables [13]. In contrast, in 2D all observables can be expressed as
functions of only one two-body scale parameter, e.g. the two-body scattering length [9, 10]. This diﬀerence is closely
related to the appearance of the Eﬁmov eﬀect [14] in 3D and its absence in 2D [15]. The extra scale appearing in 3D
may be explained by the emergence of the Thomas collapse.

We already have an extensive amount of investigations about the energy spectrum of three atoms in 2D [16–24],
but very little information can be found in the literature about the three-body structures [9]. For three identical
bosons we have only two three-body bound states with energies (E3) proportional to the two-body energy (E2), and
given by E3 = 16.52E2 and E3 = 1.27E2, respectively for the ground and excited states [16]. However, considering an
asymmetric system as AAB formed by two identical bosons, A, and a distinguishable particle, B, we can increase the
number of three-body bound states by changing the mass asymmetry [21]. When the mass ratio, mB/mA, between
particles B and A is decreased, then B-particle may be easier exchanged between the identical heavy A-particles,
which in turn generates an eﬀective potential with inﬁnite attraction in the limit of mB/mA → 0 [22, 24, 25]. This
provides a prescription for a large number of three-body bound states.
An interesting question is how the three-body bound-state structure varies close to the mass threshold where the
state disappear into the continuum. In general, the structure variation with the mass ratio is not known in 2D for
neither ground nor excited states.
If the quantum mechanical wave function is known it is in principle direct to
calculate and study the density distribution. However, this may be too elaborate for a ﬁrst overall orientation.

The simplest observable quantities that carry structure information are the relative average distances between pairs
of particles. Here the second moment is most often used as the measure, but obviously only as a constraint on the
possible structure. First order or higher moments would clearly add information to the spatial distribution. The
present work is dedicated to study the relative sizes of an asymmetric three-body AAB-system. We shall use the
Faddeev formalism with a pairwise Dirac-delta potential in momentum space [26]. The mean-square radii between
atoms AA (hr2
BCMi) and the three-body center-of-mass are then
calculated from a derivative of the Fourier transform of the respective matter density. This is much simpler than a
full Fourier transformation and subsequent study of the density distribution. Still, the relative average distances are
very indicative of the underlying structure.

The analyses of the results show that the spectrum and radii are modiﬁed Coulombic, although ﬁnite, for very small

mass ratios, and limited to two slightly asymmetric bound states for large mass ratios. We demonstrate that close to
the point where the excited states disappear their radii diverge linearly with the inverse three-body energy measured
with respect to the two-body threshold. We specially point out results for some experimentally relevant mass ratios
for atomic systems already produced in traps, that is 6Li-133Cs-133Cs and 6Li-87Rb-87Rb [2, 3].

The paper is organized as follows.

In section II we give ﬁrst the appropriate Faddeev equations in momentum
space for an AAB system of one distinguishable and two identical particles. Then we construct the three-body
wave functions and the form factors from where we calculate the diﬀerent radii. In section III we show our diﬀerent
numerical results for the radii. We present and analyze the characteristic quantities, energy spectra and mean square
radii, as functions of the mass ratio. In particular, we discuss the threshold behavior when a level is passing into
the three-body continuum of one particle and a bound pair. Finally, conclusions and perspectives are summarized in
section IV.

II. THEORETICAL FORMULATION

We consider a three-body system, AAB, consisting of two identical particles, A, of mass, mA, and bound state
energy, EAA < 0, and a third distinguishable particle, B, of mass, mB, bound to each A-particle with energy, EAB < 0.
We denote the identical particles by A and A′ when it is necessary to distinguish their coordinates. The two-body
interaction is assumed to be of very short range, and in this paper parametrized and included in the extreme zero-range
limit. This almost schematic interaction has the advantage of emphasizing universal properties, which only depend
on gross properties of the two-body interaction. The absence of spatial regions inside the potential by deﬁnition only
allows extraction of universal properties. Furthermore, simpliﬁcations are very substantial and zero-range interactions
are therefore ideal for this purpose.

The three-body problem with short-range interactions are conveniently formulated by use of the Faddeev decompo-
sition in momentum space. In the zero-range limit only s-waves are important and a number of previous investigations
derived and formulated the necessary theory [9–12]. The three-body momentum-space wave function, ΨAB,A, for the
state |ΨAABi of the AAB system is constructed from the spectator functions, χA(qA) and χB(qB), as

ΨAB,A(~qA, ~pA) ≡ h~qA, ~pA |Ψi =

where |E3| is the three-body binding energy, the mass ratio between particles B and A is denoted A ≡ mB/mA. The
wave function is denoted ΨAB,A when it is expressed in terms of ~pA and ~qA, that is respectively the relative momenta
between the B and the A′-particle, and the center-of-mass of these two and the last A-particle. Correspondingly, ~qA′
and ~qB are the other relative momenta related by

Each of these pairs of Jacobi momenta, (~pA, ~qA), (~pA′~qA′ ) and (~pB, ~qB), is complete and may conveniently be expressed
in terms of any other pair depending on the desired application.

The Faddeev components of the spectator functions, χA and χB, obey coupled integral equations obtained after

s-wave projection. The detailed derivation of these equations can be found in [20], with the result

The mean-square radii can be computed from the momentum space wave function by Fourier transform and sub-
sequent calculation of the corresponding matrix element. We ﬁrst turn to the distances between one A-particle and

the center-of-mass of the remaining AB-pair, and the distance between these two AB-particles. For this we need to
deﬁne the proper one-body densities, that is

ρ(~rA) =Z d2rAB|h~rA, ~rAB|ΨAABi|2 ,
¯ρ(~rAB) =Z d2rA|h~rA, ~rAB|ΨAABi|2 ,

(6)

(7)

where h~rA, ~rAB|ΨAABi is the coordinate-space wave function expressed in terms of the coordinates, ~rA and ~rAB, which
are the canonically conjugated to the momenta ~qA and ~pA, respectively. The Fourier transforms, FA and FAB, of
these one-body densities are now each expanded to second order in the corresponding momentum, that is

In order to calculate the remaining distances in the system, we write the three-body wave function in the set of

Jacobi momenta of the B-particle, namely

The procedure is now to solve the three-body equations in Eqs.(3) and (4) and obtain three-body energy, spectator
functions, and the total wave function in Eq. (1). The next steps are to calculate numerically FA, FB, FAA and FAB
and the necessary ﬁrst order derivatives of these functions of the squared momenta.

III. MASS DEPENDENCE

The structure is in principle known in all details from properties of the wave function. However, observables must
be expressed as expectation values where we here focus on the mean-square radius. The three-body wave function
is completely determined from the ratios of particle masses, A = mB/mA, and two-body energies, EAB/EAA. In
practical calculations it is then possible to use mA = 1 and |EAA| = 1, which corresponds to the speciﬁc choices of
mass and energy units, mA and |EAA|. To extract meaningful structure properties it is crucial to know more than
just individual radii for a given system speciﬁed by mass and energy ratios. We therefore investigate radii of a number
of low-lying excited states as functions of A.

point marked C.M. means center-of-mass of the three-body system. The notation used in the paper for the relevant distances
are also shown.

We conﬁne ourselves to bound two-body systems, where both EAB and EAA are negative. We furthermore restrict
the investigations to one typical set of energies, EAB/EAA = 1. It is possible to extend the calculations to diﬀerent
two-body energies and even to unbound two-body states. However, in the present paper we only extract the overall
behavior of many excited states by varying A. This will both provide knowledge of eﬃciency of the calculations and
accuracy of the method as well as a number of interesting physical results. The three-body system is represented
schematically in Fig.1 where the deﬁnitions are given for various mean-square radii.

FIG. 2: Low-energy spectrum of an AAB system as a function of the mass ratio A = mB/mA. The two two-body energies
are equal, EAB = EAA = E2, and the three-body energy is E3. The energies on the y-axis are given relative to the two-body
bound state energies, E2. The vertical lines indicate the mass ratios A = 6/133 and A = 6/87 corresponding to the systems
6Li-133Cs-133Cs and 6Li-87Rb-87Rb. Only ground state and ﬁrst excited states are bound for A ≥ 1.

A. Three-body energies

The energy is for most quantum states the all-important characterizing quantity which is necessary to understand
ﬁrst. Universal structure of weakly bound systems often relates spatial extension and binding energy [19]. We therefore
ﬁrst focus on the energy dependence of the system, AAB, sketched in Fig. 1 with two identical particles, A, and
another distinguishable particle, B. We show the energy spectrum in Fig. 2 as obtained from the numerical solution
of the coupled integral Eqs.(3) and (4). A similar ﬁgure can be found in [20] for other physical conditions. For A = 1
we recover the well known results that only ground and ﬁrst excited states are bound with universally given energies,
E3 = 16.52E2 and E3 = 1.27E2, proportional to the two-body energy, E2. These energies are predicted by a number
of entirely diﬀerent calculations [19]. Increasing the mass ratio even further we see that this situation persists for
all A ≥ 1, and the two bound states only show moderate relative energy variations. This may be understood from
the limit of one very heavy particle surrounded by two light masses moving around the center-of-mass in a roughly
mass-independent ﬁeld.

In the other limit of small A we ﬁnd a tremendous increase of bound states with decreasing mass ratio A. The
smallest mass ratio we consider is A = 0.01, where the system displays eight bound states of energies E3. The excited
three-body states disappear into the continuum of positive energies as A is increased. The rather dramatic mass
dependence for small A can be understood as a consequence of the increase of the eﬀective interaction generated
by the light particle. This has been known since 1979 [27] and 1980 [25] for systems in three and two dimensions,
respectively. Recently, a diﬀerent technique was used to derive the responsible eﬀective potential in two dimensions
[22]. These derivations assumed the Born-Oppenheimer approximation where validity only is justiﬁed for A ≪ 1, or
at least when A ≤ 1. After integrating out the coordinate of particle B we are left with an eﬀective hamiltonian for
the relative motion of the two heavy A-particles, that is

where ~rAA is the relative coordinate between the two A-particles, µAA and VAA(r) are their reduced mass and two-
body potential, while V (BO)(rAA) is the strongly A-depending Born-Oppenheimer potential resulting from the light
[22] the eﬀective Born-Oppenheimer potential was derived analytically as function of
third particle, B.

rAA, given in units of (2/mA|EAA|)1/2. More details of derivation and accuracy can be found in Ref. [22].
The large-distance behavior in Eq. (23) is exponentially convergent towards the negative two-body energy, EAA,
with a length scale proportional to 1/mef . The short-distance part exhibits an attractive Coulombic behavior in
Eq. (22). Thus only a ﬁnite number of bound states below EAB are possible, although that number would increase
unlimited as the radius of the allowed space increases inversely proportional to (4A/(2 + A))1/2. However, we are
mostly interested in the lowest energy states which necessarily are located in the strongly attractive region at smaller
distances. The small-distance Coulomb-like behavior is controlled by an eﬀective charge squared, Z 2

We can use Eq. (25) as a useful reference spectrum for comparison to the energies in the limit of A ≪ 1, shown
in Fig. 2. To do this we have to distinguish between the present calculations and the pure Coulomb spectrum
obtained by neglecting the short-range potential between the two heavy A-particles. We compare these results in
Table I for the lowest two bound states. The pure Born-Oppenheimer binding energies in the ﬁrst column turn out
to be larger by about 15 % for the two lowest states than the numerically calculated energies for precisely the same
system. These deviations, already veriﬁed in Ref.
[22], arise entirely from the inherent approximation in the Born-
Oppenheimer procedure, that is neglect of recoil energy of the heavy particles. This diﬀerence has the same origin as
the non-adiabatic diagonal term in an adiabatic expansion like in [15].

The numerical inaccuracy in these computations are much smaller and rather on the level of fractions of permille. It
is probably useful here to emphasize that omission of the AA-interaction in the present two dimensions is completely
equivalent to use of zero binding energy between the two A-particles. This is seen formally by letting EAA approach
zero in Eqs.(3) and (4).

We can now turn to the results in both Table I and Fig. 2 where the A-interaction is included. We ﬁrst notice that
each level roughly seems to follow the predicted linear decrease on the logarithmic scale for small A. Quantitatively,

7

the calculated energies for A = 0.01 are much more bound than the pure Coulomb spectrum in Eq. (25). The lowest
levels are inﬂuenced the most by the short-range attraction between the two A-particles. The ground and ﬁrst excited
states are more bound by factors of about 2.3 and 1.5, respectively.

The following two or three excited states in Table I show a less systematic behavior. They deviate by even less
from the Coulomb estimate but still from the side of more binding. The continuation to larger excitations begins to
deviate from being Coulombic, since the states exploit distances outside the Coulomb-like attractive region.

These comparisons explain the increasing attraction for the whole spectrum and the derived larger binding with
decreasing A. The absolute values are most Coulomb-like for the four ﬁrst excited states. The ground state is
substantially lower due to the AA-attraction at very short distance and the higher-lying levels feel the long-range
Born-Oppenheimer potential. As A increases the bound states move up in energy, the number decreases, and the
Coulomb potential support fewer and fewer bound states.

B. Size and structure

Equipped with an understanding of the energy spectrum as function of the mass ratio we turn to the corresponding
underlying structure. We show ﬁrst in Fig. 3 the calculated mean-square radial distances, < r2
AA >, between the two
identical particles. We notice an almost reﬂected behavior compared to the three-body energies. The radii decrease
while the binding energies increase. The two lowest bound states are present for all mass ratios, whereas the sizes for
the higher excited states diverge as their energies reach their thresholds for binding.

the Born-Oppenheimer estimates precisely as we did for the energies. We observe the opposite behavior compared
to the energies, that is the mean square radii are largest for the smallest binding energies. The results for the two
lowest states for rigorous Born-Oppenheimer are about 15 % smaller than obtained from the full numerical calculation

AA i, from Eq. (26), and numerical results without,

without an AA interaction. These deviations are again due to the neglect of recoil energy as assumed in the Born-
Oppenheimer prescription. The observed opposite tendency is reﬂected in the formula in Eqs. (25) and (26) where
the product is state independent apart from the last factor in Eq. (26).

We now turn to the full calculation with sizable two-body energies between all three pairs of particles. The ground
state mean-square radius is a factor of about 3.5 smaller than derived from the Coulomb estimate in Eq. (26). This
deviation is again qualitatively consistent with the similar larger binding energy of that state. The ﬁrst excited
state is only smaller than the Coulomb estimate by a factor of 2.2. The following two higher-lying states have radii
rather similar to the Coulomb estimates. These states extend beyond the Coulomb region and into the region of the
more conﬁning large-distance Born-Oppenheimer potential from Eq. (23). The eﬀect is a comparably smaller spatial
extension which is very close to the results from Eq. (26).

At least one more distance is required to characterize the three-body geometric structure. We ﬁrst choose the
distance between unequal pairs of particles, A and B. The mean-square radius is a quantum mechanical expectation
value where the two identical particles cannot be distinguished. The results shown in Fig. 4 are therefore averages
over distances between particle B and the two A-particles. We notice ﬁrst that the AB mean-square distance is a
ﬂat or slightly increasing function with decreasing small mass ratios for both ground and ﬁrst excited states. The
higher-lying states show the opposite tendency of marginal decrease. Furthermore the rAB-value in Fig. 4 is much
larger than the rAA radius in Fig. 3, although with a diﬀerence decreasing with excitation energy. To understand this
we cannot turn to the Born-Oppenheimer calculations which only provides information about the AA system while
the B-coordinate is integrated out. In the limit of small mass ratios the light B-particle is very little concerned with
the slow relative AA motion. The B-particle moves much faster and almost independently in an orbit of much larger
radius.

The behavior at small mass ratios is changing drastically with increasing mass ratio. First the radii of the excited

9

states diverge at their thresholds of binding. Second, the distance rAB decreases with increasing A for the two bound
states. The results for A = 1 agree with the known mean-square ratio of about 70 between the two bound states [15].
As A increases above 1 we see that the radii only changes very little precisely consistent with the same behavior as
shown by the binding energies.
The sizes reﬂect the structures originated in corresponding wave functions. We would like to reproduce the relative
as well as the absolute sizes in ﬁgs. 3 and 4 by interpretation with appropriate wave functions and/or geometric
conﬁgurations. We focus now on a large mass ratio of A = 100 where the ratio between mean-square distances of
AA and AB-particles is 1.67 and 1.3 for ground and excited states, respectively. A fully symmetric wave function in
hyperspherical coordinates corresponds to ρ−3/2 exp(−κρ) where the general deﬁnition of ρ is given in Eq. (29). For
the present special case we have

(27)
where the κ-value is given by 2κ2 = 2mA|E3|. The mean-square radius between a pair of particles, i and k, is then
from this very simpliﬁed symmetric wave function found by straightforward calculations to give

(2mA + mB)ρ2 = mA(~rA − ~rA′ )2 + mB(~rA − ~rB)2 + mB(~rA′ − ~rB)2 ,

hr2
iki = 2/(8µik|E3|) ,

(28)

where µik is the reduced mass of particles i and k (i, k=A,A,B). We shall refer to it as symmetric estimate as it is
obtained from the fully symmetric wave function. This schematic estimate from Eq. (28) are smaller by a factor of 2.6
and 8.8 for the AA mean-square radii of ground and excited states, respectively. The corresponding ratios for the AB
mean-square radii are 3.1 and 14 which ﬁrst of all reﬂect the diﬀerent reduced mass dependence. These numbers are
for squared radii, and the linear distances, obtained by taking the square root, then only deviate by factors varying
from 1.5 to about 4.

Extreme asymmetric structures may be with two particles in a bound state at small distance and the third particle
more loosely bound at a larger distance. To produce a ﬁnite AA-distance the conﬁguration must correspond to a
structure like A − (AB) (see Eq. 26). The mean-square radius is then 2/(4µA,AB|EA,AB|) which again is inversely
proportional to the two-body reduced mass of the distant A-particle relative to the stronger bound AB-entity. How-
ever, the absolute value of this estimate lies between those of ground and excited states for a reasonable choice of
EA,AB ≈ 2 × EAB.
Both extreme structures of total symmetry and extreme asymmetry fail to reproduce the calculated moments.
Furthermore, the large diﬀerence between ground and excited states indicate a sizable structure variation. The ground
state is within a factor of two from the symmetric estimate, whereas the excited state extends in size substantially
beyond the inverse three-body energy relation in Eq. (28). The latter is more reminiscent of the huge increase of radii
found in the Eﬁmov states which in three dimensions are coherent superpositions of asymmetric geometric structure.

Let us ﬁnally consider asymmetric structures where a ﬁnite average radius is assumed between the strongest bound
AB two-body substructure. We ﬁrst assume a given distance, rAA′ , between the two A-particles, where the B-particle

The sizes are often measured as distances relative to the total center-of-mass. This only provides little additional
information but it is very illustrative beside serving as consistency check on our understanding of the underlying
structures. We show in Fig. 5 the mean-square radial distance of particles A from the center-of-mass. The two limits
of A diﬀer very much from each other. Varying A from small to large values the three-body center-of-mass moves
from the center-of-mass of the AA system to the center of particle B. This implies by geometric reasoning thatphr2

There is a lack of experimental information concerning the sizes of these systems in two dimensions. However, we
are able to compare our results for A = 1 with those from Ref. [15] as follows. The spatial extension of a system can be
measured by radial moments. Often the second moment, the root-mean-square radius, is used as an average measure.
Diﬀerent distributions can be of interest as exempliﬁed by average charge- or mass-radii. For a self-supported system
of bound particles the center-of-mass is conserved and it is natural to measure all distances with respect to this point,
~RCM . The hyper-radius, ρ, is a length coordinate designed for this purpose, that is

mAρ2 =

Xk=1

mk(~rk − ~RCM )2 ,

(29)

where we chose mA as the normalization mass in the general deﬁnition of the hyper-radius. The corresponding
expectation value is related to the root-mean-square radius, Rrms, of the mass distribution as deﬁned for our three-
body system by

where the vectors, ~rkCM , by deﬁnition connects particle k and the center-of-mass of the three-body system. The

AB-particles, and analogousluy for particle B. We therefore have the relations

FIG. 7: The threshold behavior of diﬀerent mean-square radii for the second excited state as function of mass ratio. The
divergent mean-square radii reach a constant value at threshold when multiplied by E3 − E2. Vertical lines are the mass ratios
corresponding to the systems 6Li-133Cs-133Cs and 6Li-87Rb-87Rb.

We want now to investigate in more details how the structure varies with mass ratio when the energy of a state
approaches its threshold for binding. We know that in three dimensions the sizes of bosonic three-body systems diverge
logarithmically at their three-body energy thresholds. In contrast, the sizes remain ﬁnite for brunnian systems with
more than three bosons [28], even at their corresponding thresholds of binding. In these cases, the thresholds are
reached from the bound side by decreasing the two-body attraction which all the time are unable to bind a pair. In
the present study we are decreasing the mass ratio, and in practice decreasing the eﬀective interaction between the
constituents of the system.

Again we use the mean-square radii as indicative measures. We focus on the second excited state which is the
lowest-lying state with diverging size. Its behaviour is repeated by the other excited states, which we therefore do
not need to discuss in this paper. We show in Fig. 7 the results as functions of A for the diﬀerent radii of the second
excited state. We multiply the radii by the energy above the two-body threshold, |E3 − E2|, in order to extract the
behavior of the divergence. The striking results are constants as the threshold is approached. Thus, the divergence
is inversely proportional to E3 − E2. The implication is that the threshold structure must have the energy, E3 − E2,
corresponding to one bound two-body system.

These structures would according to Ref.

Two structures seems to be intuitively possible at threshold, that is either particle A or particle B is ejected while
the remaining pair settles in their ground state. In both cases the threshold structure resembles two-body systems,
that is (AA) − B or (AB) − A with corresponding reduced masses µAA,B ≈ 0.18 or µAB,A ≈ 0.54, where we used a
threshold value of A ≈ 0.2.
ik >= 2/(3µik|Eth|), where
µik and |Eth| are two-body reduced mass and the vanishing threshold energy, respectively. This means that the
curves in Fig. 7 for mA < r2

AB > |Eth|/2) → (0.62, 0.62)
|Eth|/2, mA < r2
are the two corresponding two-body threshold structures, where either B or A are ejected. The two identical ﬁnite
values in the latter case are due to the same distance between the ejected A-particle and both the remaining A and
B particles in a bound state.

ik > |Eth|/2 = mA/(3µik), which can be either 1.85 or 0.62. Thus, (mA < r2

AB > |Eth|/2) → (0.0, 1.85) or (mA < r2

[15] lead to the two-body divergence, < r2

AA > |Eth|/2, mA < r2

Obviously the best match to the results displayed in Fig. 7 is ejection of one of the A-particles. In the calculated
expectation value is contained an average over the distances between the two A-particles and particle B. One of these
distances remains ﬁnite and do not contribute except through a reduction of the probability by a factor of 2. This
accounts for the value of mA<r2

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We studied the structure of a three-body system formed by two identical bosons and a third particle using a two-
body Dirac-delta potential in momentum space. We computed all distances to characterize our three-body system
for a mass ratio supporting up to eight bound states. The development of our formalism in momentum space may
be suitable to study such weakly-bound systems as in conﬁguration space the tail of the three-body wave function
should extend considerably making the numerical part of the calculation more diﬃcult. The mean-square radii were
extracted here from the derivative of the one and two-body form factors, which is also easier than to perform the
complete Fourier transform of the wave function.

The technique used here may be easily extended to a fully asymmetric system considering even unbound two-body
subsystems or fermions. Our zero-range calculation, which is the limit for the short-range potentials, provides a
qualitative guide for the experimentalists to study the universal behavior of the structure of molecules inside a mixed
species atomic trap. Direct quantitative comparisons are certainly possible, but the necessary derivations are beyond
this paper.

For the system we studied, the relevant parameters were the two-body energies and the mass ratios. For our
purposes we considered equal two-body energies and varied the mass ratio. We saw a very diﬀerent behavior for small
and large mass ratios. For the energy spectrum we obtained the same result as previous calculations: as the mass
ratio is decreased the number of three-body bound states increases. As this mass ratio is increased only the ground
and ﬁrst excited state survive. Small mass ratio was analyzed by use of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation of the
potential. The eﬀective interaction generated by the light particle has a Coulomb like behavior for small distances
between particles of the heavier pair. This is the most attractive region, where the short-range interaction between
the two A-particles also is strongest. Consequently this is where the lowest states are located.

Considering this Coulomb potential calculated from the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, the three-body energies
and AA radii were derived and compared to the full calculations. We saw that the numerically obtained ground state
is more bound with a smaller radius than arisng from the Coulomb estimate. The ﬁrst few of the following higher-
lying states still feel the AA interaction but are more similar to the Coulomb estimates. The even higher excited
states extend spatially beyond the Coulomb-like potential, but all bound states eventually being conﬁned within the
exponentially decaying potential at large distance.

We discussed the diﬀerent radii results for the limits of small and large mass ratios, where some distances should
match. The radii close to the mass ratio threshold diverge proportional to the three-body energy measured with
respect to the two-body threshold. The analysis of the diﬀerent radii permitted to conclude that at the threshold
we have a bound AB pair and the ejection of particle A. In the ﬁgures we showed explicitly the mass ratios for the
recent set of atoms 6Li-133Cs-133Cs and 6Li-87Rb-87Rb produced experimentally.

In summary, the present work contribute to the characterization of the many variations of universal three-body
structures in two dimensions. We conﬁned ourselves to two-body mean-square moments in AAB systems where
each pair is bound with the same energy. Interesting generalizations would then be to vary the ratio of two-body
energies, and extract radial dependencies when thresholds of two-body binding are approached. Also extensions into
the two-body continuum, still for bound three-body systems, would be another set of interesting investigations. The
last tempting generalization is the ABC systems with three diﬀerent particles.
