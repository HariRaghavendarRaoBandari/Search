Abstract

In this paper we relate the dynamical properties of the sequence of orthonormal
polynomials deﬁned by a probability measure µ with non-polar compact support
S(µ) to the potential theoretic properties of S(µ).

1 Introduction and general results
For µ a Borel probability measure in C of inﬁnite but compact support S(µ) we denote
by {Pn(z)} := {Pn(µ;z)} the sequence of orthonormal polynomials w.r.t. µ. That is the
unique orthonormal sequence in L2(µ) with :

Pn(z) = γnzn + lower order terms,

where γn > 0.

(1)

Equivalently Pn is the unique normalized polynomial of the form (1) and orthogonal to
all lower degree polynomials. Bounds on and asymptotic behavior of such polynomials
using a potential theoretic approach is established in the monograph, [S-T] by Stahl and
Totik.

For S ⊂ C a compact non-polar subset we denote by Ω = Ω(S) the unbounded
connected component of C(cid:114)S by K = K(S) := C(cid:114)Ω the ﬁlled-in or just ﬁlled S and
by J = J(S) = ∂ K = ∂Ω ⊂ S the outer boundary of S. Furthermore we deﬁne the
exceptional subset E of S as

E = E(S) = {z ∈ J |z is not a Dirichlet regular boundary point }.

The set E is an Fσ polar subset, [R, Th. 4.2.4 plus Th. 4.2.5]. Finally we denote by
gΩ : C −→ [0,∞) the Greens function for Ω with pole at inﬁnity. That is the unique
non-negative subharmonic function, which is harmonic and positive on Ω, zero pre-
cisely on K(cid:114)E and satisﬁes gΩ(z) = log|z| + O(1) at inﬁnity.
The bounds in Stahl and Totik [S-T] involves also the extended notion of Greens
function gB : C −→ [0,∞), with pole at inﬁnity for a general connected Borel subset
B ⊂ C with bounded, non-polar complement L. That is the unique non-negative sub-
harmonic function, which is harmonic and positive on the interior of B, satisﬁes

gB(z) = log|z|− logCap(L) + o(1)

at inﬁnity

and equals zero qu. e. on C\ B. (qu.e. quasi-everywhere meaning except on a set of
zero capacity, for comparison [R] uses n.e. nearly everywhere.)
Deﬁnition 1.1. We denote by B the set of Borel probability measure on C with compact
non polar support.

The following notation, which merges the notation of [S-T] with the above, shall be

used through out and without further notice:
Notation 1. For µ ∈ B we denote by S = S(µ) the support of µ, by Ω = Ω(S(µ))
the unbounded component of the complement and by gΩ the Greens function for Ω
and by K = K(S(µ)) the ﬁlled-in S(µ), in [S-T] denoted the polynomial convex hull
of S. We also write J = J(S(µ)) = ∂Ω = ∂ K for the outer boundary of S(µ) and E =
E(S(µ)) for the exceptional subset of J. We denote by gµ : C −→ [0,∞) the minimal
carrier Greens function for µ, see [S-T, (1.3) p. 2, Lemma 1.2.4 p. 9]. And by Eµ the
exceptional set for gµ, that is

Eµ := {z ∈ S(µ) |gµ (z) > 0}

and ﬁnally by Pn(z) = Pn(µ;z), n ≥ 0 the associated orthonormal polynomials.

We shall invoke the following two theorems from [S-T], recast in this notation.

[S-T]-Theorem 1 ([S-T, Lemma 1.1.3]). For µ ∈ B all zeros of the orthonormal poly-
nomials Pn(z), n ∈ N, are contained in the convex hull Co(K), and for any compact
subset V ⊆ Ω the number of zeros of Pn(z), n ∈ N, on V is bounded as n → ∞.
[S-T]-Theorem 2 ([S-T, Th. 1.1.4]). For any µ ∈ B we have

|pn(z)| 1

n ≤ e gµ (z)

limsup
n→∞

(2)

2

locally uniformly in C, and

(3)
locally uniformly in C\ Co(K). In Co(K)∩ Ω the lower bound (3) holds true only in
capacity, that is, for every compact set V ⊆ Ω and every ε > 0 we have

liminf
n→∞

|pn(z)| 1

n ≥ e gΩ(z)

Cap({z ∈ V||pn(z)| 1

n < e gΩ(z) − ε}) = 0.

lim
n→∞

(4)
In Co(K) ∩ Ω the lower bound can also be given in the following form: For every
inﬁnite subsequence N ⊆ N we have

|pn(z)| 1

n ≥ e gΩ(z)

qu.e. in Ω∩ Co(K)

limsup
n→∞, n∈N

and on the boundary J of K we have
|pn(z)| 1

n ≥ 1

limsup
n→∞, n∈N

qu.e. in

J = ∂Ω.

(5)

(6)

The meaning of locally uniformly for limsup, liminf and lim here as in e.g (3) is
as follows : For a sequence of functions { fn : U −→ C}n and a function f : U −→ C

limsup
n→∞

fn(z) ≤ f (z)

fn(z) ≥ f (z)

liminf
n→∞

lim
n→∞

fn(z) = f (z)

if and only if for every z ∈ U and every sequence {zn}n ⊂ U converging to z the respec-
tive statements holds, e.g.

fn(zn) ≥ f (z)

liminf
n→∞

This is weaker than uniform convergence on every compact subset of U. But one
easily checks that, if f is respectively lower semi-continuous, upper-semicontinuous
or continuous, on some compact subset K ⊂ U, then the respective locally uniform
convergences implies uniform convergence on K.

For P(z) = γzd + . . . a polynomial of degree d > 1 we denote by ΩP the basin of

attraction for ∞ for P:

(cid:122)

(cid:125)(cid:124)

k times

(cid:123)

ΩP := {z ∈ C |Pk(z) −→
k→∞

∞},

P◦ P◦ . . .◦ P, by KP := C(cid:114)ΩP the ﬁlled Julia set for P and by JP := ∂ΩP =
where Pk =
∂ KP the Julia set for P. The ﬁlled Julia set KP is compact and can also be characterized
as follows. Let R be so big that P(C(cid:114)D(R)) ⊂ C(cid:114)D(R), where D(R) := {z||z| < R},
then P−1(D(R)) ⊂ D(R) and KP equals the nested intersection :

KP =

P−k(D(R)).

(7)

(cid:92)

k≥0

We denote moreover by gP : C −→ [0,∞) the Greens function for ΩP with pole at infty.
It vanishes precisely on KP, i.e. the exceptional set E for gP is empty and hence every
point of JP is a Dirichlet regular boundary point of ΩP. It satisﬁes

gP(z) = lim
k→∞

1

dk log+|Pk(z)|

3

where log+ is the positive part of log. It follows from this formula that

gP(P(z)) = d · gP(z)

and thus

Cap(KP) =

1
|γ| 1
d−1

.

In addition to the notation deﬁned in Notation 1 we shall use the following notation
through out and without further mention:
Notation 2. For a Borel measure µ ∈ B and Pn the associated orthonormal polyno-
mials we denote by Ωn, Jn and Kn respectively the basin of attraction for ∞, the Julia
set and the ﬁlled Julia set of Pn. Moreover we denote by gn the Greens function for Ωn
with pole at ∞.

From the formula for the capacities of the ﬁlled Julia sets Kn above we have

we obtain immediately by combining with [S-T, Cor. 1.17, formula (1.13)]
Proposition 1.2. For µ ∈ B:
cµ ≤ liminf
n→∞

Cap(Kn) ≤ Cap(K),

Cap(Kn) ≤ limsup
n→∞

(8)

where cµ is the so-called minimal carrier capacity [S-T, Def. 1.1.1].

Furthermore we have

Proposition 1.3. Let µ ∈ B and let R > 0 be so that K ⊂ D(R). Then there exists N
such that for all n ≥ N:

Kn ⊂ P−1

n (D(R)) ⊂ D(R).

Proof. By (3) we have

n

log|Pn(z)| ≥ gΩ(z)

locally uniformly on C(cid:114)Co(K). Suppose K ⊂ D(R). Then {z | |z| = R} =: CR is a
compact subset disjoint from K on which gΩ is continuous. Let ε := inf{gΩ(z) | |z| =
R} > 0. Then by the above inequality and the compactness of CR ⊂ Ω, there exists N
such that

∀ n ≥ N,∀ z ∈ CR :

log|Pn(z)| ≥ ε/2.

n

Possibly increasing N we can suppose log(R) < Nε/2. Then since the zeros of Pn are
contained Co(K) ⊂ D(R), [S-T]-Theorem 1, the minimal modulus principle implies

∀ n ≥ N :

Pn(C(cid:114)D(R)) ⊂ C(cid:114)D(R)

and thus by (7)

∀ n ≥ N :

Kn ⊂ P−1

n (D(R)) ⊂ D(R).

Proof. Deﬁne c := liminf

K ⊂ D(R(cid:48)). Further let R > R(cid:48) and choose N so that

Cap(Kn) > 0, let ε > 0 be given and choose R(cid:48) > 1 such that

∀ n ≥ N : Kn ⊂ D(R(cid:48))

and

From the representation of the Greens functions
gn(z) = log|z|− logCap(Kn) +

R(cid:48) ≥ Cap(Kn) > c/2.
(cid:90)
C log|1− w/z|dωn(z)

we ﬁnd
|gn(z)− log|z|| < M =: log(1−R(cid:48)/R)+max{logR(cid:48),−2logc}
∀ n≥ N, ∀ z,|z|≥ R :
Possibly increasing N we can suppose max{M,R} < Nε/2. For each n denote by An
the set {z|log+|Pn(z)| < nε/2}. Then for each n ≥ N and all z ∈ C(cid:114)An : |Pn(z)| ≥ R

uniformly on C.
Moreover by (8) the hypothesis on the capacities is satisﬁed, if the minimal carrier
capacity cµ > 0. However according to [S-T, Example 1.5.4], there are measures µ ∈
B for which 0 = cµ < c = liminf
k→∞
Deﬁnition 1.6. In the sequel we shall denote by B+ ⊂ B the set

Cap(Knk ).

B+ := {µ ∈ B | 0 < liminf
n→∞

Cap(Kn)}

Combining Theorem 1.4 with with Stahl and Totiks bounds [S-T]-Theorem 2 above

we obtain as immediate corollary
Corollary 1.7. For all µ ∈ B+ :

gn(z) ≤ gµ (z)

limsup
n→∞

(10)

locally uniformly in C. And

(11)
locally uniformly in C\ Co(K). In Co(K)∩ Ω the lower bound (11) holds true only in
capacity, that is, for every compact set V ⊆ Ω and every ε > 0 we have

liminf
n→∞

gn(z) ≥ gΩ(z)

Cap({z ∈ V|gn(z) ≤ gΩ(z)− ε}) = 0.

(12)
In Co(K) ∩ Ω the lower bound can also be given in the following form: For every
inﬁnite subsequence N ⊆ N we have

lim
n→∞

gn(z) ≥ gΩ(z)

limsup
n→∞, n∈N

qu.e. in Co(K).

(13)

Note that as with (2) the bound (10) holds for µ ∈ B. However if the minimal

carrier capacity cµ = 0, then gµ ≡ ∞ and the statement is trivial.
Question 1.8. What is the analog of [S-T, Th. 2.1.1]?

Question 1.9. What is the relation between K and limits of Kn?

We shall start giving answers to these questions below.

6

2 Relating the sequence {Kn}n to K
2.1 The Hausdoff distance between compact subsets of C.
Let K denote the set of compact subsets of C. For L,M ∈ K we deﬁne the Hausdorff
semi-distance from L to M

dH(L,M) := sup{d(z,M) | z ∈ L} = sup
z∈L

inf
w∈M

|z− w|

and the Hausdorff distance between the two sets as

DH(L,M) := max{dH(L,M),dH(M,L)}.

For (Kn)n ⊂ K a bounded sequence of compact sets, i.e. a sequence for which there
exists R > 0 such that Kn ⊂ D(R) for all n, we deﬁne the symbols

liminf
n→∞
limsup
n→∞

Kn := {z ∈ C | ∃(zn)n,Kn (cid:51) zn −→
n→∞
Kn := {z ∈ C | ∃(nk)k,nk (cid:37) ∞ and ∃(znk )k,Knk (cid:51) znk −→
k→∞

z}

z}

Kn is the largest compact set L with lim
n→∞

Kn is the smallest compact set M with lim
n→∞

It can be shown that liminf
n→∞
that limsup
n→∞
serves to explain the names, but they will not bee needed here. Instead we shall use :
Lemma 2.1. The complements of I := liminf
n→∞
by:

dH(L,Kn) = 0. And
dH(Kn,M) = 0. These statements

Kn and S := limsup
n→∞

Kn are characterized

z0 /∈ I ⇐⇒ ∃ δ0 > 0, ∃(nk)k, nk (cid:37) ∞ s.t. ∀ k : d(z0,Knk ) > δ0

z0 /∈ S ⇐⇒ ∃ δ0 > 0, ∃ N ∀n ≥ N : d(z0,Kn) > δ0.

Proof. The ﬁrst implication ”⇐” is trivial. For the reverse implication let z0 /∈ I be
arbitrary and suppose the right hand side does not hold. Then

∀δ > 0 ∃ N s.t. ∀ n ≥ N : d(z0,Kn) ≤ δ .

(14)
For each n let zn ∈ Kn be a point with |zn − z0| = d(z0,Kn). Then Kn (cid:51) zn → z0 by (14),
which contradicts the assumption z0 /∈ I.
The second implication ”⇐” is also trivial. For the reverse implication let z0 /∈ S be
arbitrary and suppose the right hand side does not hold. Then for any δ > 0 there are
inﬁnitely many values of n with d(z0,Kn) ≤ δ . Thus we may construct an increasing
sequence (nk)k of integers such that d(z0,knk ) ≤ 1/k say. Take as above for each k
a point zk ∈ Knk with |zk − z0| = d(z0,Knk ) ≤ 1/k. The existence of this sequence
contradicts z0 /∈ S.

It follows immediately that the sets liminf
n→∞

since by the Lemma they have open complements.

Kn ⊆ limsup
n→∞

Kn ⊆ D(R) are compact,

7

2.2 Nearly convergence of Kn to K
As a response to the ﬁrst part of Question 1.9 we have:
Theorem 2.2. For any µ ∈ B+ :

J(cid:114)Eµ ⊂ liminf
n→∞

Jn.

Proof. Since the right hand side is compact and hence closed it sufﬁces to prove that
J(cid:114)Eµ ⊂ liminf
Jn.
n→∞
Then gµ (z0) = 0 and according to Lemma 2.1

Jn. Suppose to the contrary that there exists z0 ∈ (J(cid:114)Eµ )\liminf
n→∞

∃ δ > 0, ∃(nk)k, nk (cid:37) ∞ s.t. ∀ k : D(z0,δ )∩ Jnk ) = /0.

(15)
Since z0 ∈ J there exists w0 ∈ D(z0,δ /4) ∩ Ω. Choose r, 0 < r ≤ δ /4 such that
D(w0,r) ⊂ Ω. Let 2ε = gΩ(w0) > 0 and deﬁne

L := {w ∈ D(w0,r) | gΩ(w) ≥ 2ε}.

Let L0 denote the connected component of L containing w0. Since gΩ is subharmonic,
it has no local maxima. It follows that L0 ⊂ Ω∩ D(z0,δ /2) is a non trivial compact
continuum and hence Cap(L0) > 0. Thus by Stahl and Totiks bound (12) there exists
N such that

∀ k ≥ N : Cap({z ∈ L0|gnk (z) ≤ gΩ(z)− ε}) < Cap(L0).

Since gΩ(z) ≥ 2ε on L0 it follows that ∀ k ≥ N ∃ zk ∈ L0 such that gnk (zk) ≥ ε. Com-
bining with (15) we ﬁnd that D(z0,δ ) ⊂ Ωnk for k ≥ N. And by applying Harnacks
inequality we obtain

1− 1
2
1 + 1
2

≥ ε/3 > 0.

gnk (z0) ≥ gnk (zk)

On the other hand by (10)

gnk (z0) ≤ gµ (z0) = 0,

limsup
k→∞

which is a contradiction.
Theorem 2.3. For µ ∈ B+ :

Kn ⊂ Co(K)

limsup
n→∞

Moreover for any ε > 0 and Vε := {z ∈ C|gΩ(z) ≥ ε}
Cap(Vε ∩ Kn) = 0

lim
n→∞

8

Proof. Since z ∈ Kn if and only if gn(z) = 0 and gΩ(z) > 0 on Ω = C(cid:114)K the inclusion

Kn ⊂ Co(K)

limsup
n→∞

follows immediately from (11). Choose R > 0 so large that Kn ⊂ D(R) for all n ≥ 2.
Then we obtain from (12)

Cap({z ∈ Vε ∩ D(R) |gn(z) < gΩ(z)− ε/2}) = 0.

lim
n→∞

combining with gΩ(z) ≥ ε on Vε and gn(z) = 0 on Kn we obtain in particular

Cap(Vε ∩ Kn) = 0.

lim
n→∞

3 Results on n-th root regular measures
According to Stahl and Totik a measure µ ∈ B is nth-root regular, in short µ ∈ Reg iff

1

n log|Pn(z)| = gΩ(z).

lim
n→∞

locally uniformly for z ∈ C(cid:114)Co(K), in particular Reg ⊂ B+. This is equivalent to
[S-T, Th. 3.2.1 formula (2.1)]

|Pn(µ;z)|1/n ≤ egΩ(z).

limsup
n→∞

locally uniformly in C. Combining these with Theorem 1.4 we have as immediate
corollary

Corollary 3.1. The following statements are equivalent:
i) µ ∈ Reg
ii) µ ∈ B+ and

lim
n→∞

gn(z) = gΩ(z).

locally uniformly for z ∈ C(cid:114)Co(K(µ))

iii) µ ∈ B+ and

locally uniformly on C.

iv) µ ∈ B+ and

for quasi every z ∈ J.

gn(z) ≤ gΩ(z).

limsup
n→∞

lim
n→∞

gn(z) = 0

(18)

Example 3.2. Prime examples of µ ∈ Reg are the harmonic measures viewed from
inﬁnity on the outer boundary of a compact non-polar subset of C.

Recycling the proof of Theorem 2.2 but using (17) instead of (10) we obtain the

stronger result (compare also with Theorem 2.3)
Theorem 3.3. Suppose µ ∈ Reg. Then

J(cid:114)E ⊂ liminf
n→∞

Jn,

where E denotes the (Fσ and polar) exceptional set for the Greens function gΩ.
Corollary 3.4. For µ ∈ Reg with J Dirichlet-regular :

J ⊂ liminf
n→∞

Jn.
Proposition 3.5. If µ ∈ Reg with K = Co(K) then
Kn ⊆ limsup
n→∞

J ⊆ liminf
n→∞

Kn ⊆ K.

Proof. For a compact set K with Co(K) = K every boundary point is (Dirichlet)-
regular. Moreover Jn ⊂ Kn so that the ﬁrst inclusion follows from Corollary 3.4. And
the last follows from Theorem 2.3.

Corollary 3.6. For any compact convex subset K and any ε > 0 there exists polynomi-
als Pn (of high degree n) with

D(∂ K,Kn) < ε

and

D(Kn,K) < ε.

Example 3.7. The following example shows that we can not expect that

Kn ⊂ K.

limsup
n→∞

holds for general non-convex K. Suppose K ⊂ C is any full compact subset of C with
K = −K, i.e. z (cid:55)→ −z is an involution of K and let ω denote harmonic measure on
J = ∂ K. Then the orthonormal polynomials Pn for ω are even for n even and odd for n
odd. In particular 0 is a ﬁxed point of each P2n+1, n ≥ 0 and so 0 ∈ K2n+1. In particular
0 ∈ limsupn→∞ Kn. However we may choose K as above with 0 /∈ K. Note that K
can not be connected in this case. Note also that it is well known that for measures µ
with compact, non-polar and not connected support contained in the real line R, the
orthogonal polynomials will have zeros in the real gaps of the support.

4 The orthogonal polynomials for the measure of max-

imal entropy of a polynomial.

In this section we shall discuss the monic orthogonal polynomials w.r.t. the measure of
maximal entropy of a monic polynomial of degree d ≥ 2.

As the degree of the polynomials are rather high, the coloring scheme of equipotentials is ﬁner
than the standard coloring scheme, which simply colors according to the number of iterations, it

Let Q be any monic polynomial of degree d ≥ 2 and let ω denote the harmonic

2) ω is the unique measure of maximal entropy for Q, [L].

The following Theorem furnishes relations between holomorphic dynamics and

orthogonal polynomials:
Theorem 4.1 ([B-G-H]). Let Q(z) = zd + azd−1 + . . . be a monic polynomial and let
ω denote the unique measure of maximal entropy for Q. Then the monic orthogonal
polynomials {Qn} w.r.t. ω satisﬁes:

1. Q1(z) = z + a/d.
2. ∀k ∈ N : Qkd(z) = Qk(Q(z)).
3. ∀k ∈ N : Qdk (z) = Q(Qk(z)) = Qk(z) + a/d

in particular if Q is also centered, (meaning that a = 0), then Qdk = Qk for all k ≥ 0.
Since ω equals harmonic measure on J we have ω ∈ Reg and the ω-2-norm 1/γn

of Qn satisﬁes

n→∞

1
n = Cap(K) = 1

However by the above, more is true:
Corollary 4.2. For any ﬁxed k ∈ N and any m ≥ 0

Question 4.3. Is the entire sequence logγn bounded?

γkdm = γk.

Recall that Jn and Kn are the Julia sets and ﬁlled Julia set of the n-th orthonormal
polynomial Pn := γnQn. The Greens function gQ for KQ vanishes precisely on KQ, so
the exceptional set E = Eω is empty. Thus we have
Corollary 4.4.

JQ ⊆ liminf
n→∞

Jn ⊆ limsupKn ⊆ Co(KQ).

And moreover for any ε > 0 and Vε := {z ∈ C|gΩ(z) ≥ ε}

Cap(Vε ∩ Kn) = 0.
