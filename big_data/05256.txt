We report the progress on the lattice QCD calculation of the glue spin contribution to proton
spin. This calculation is carried out with valence overlap fermion on 2+1 ﬂavor DWF gauge
conﬁgurations at two lattice spacings with the momentum of the frame in the kinematic range
0 ≤ p2 ≤ 2 GeV2. A mild frame dependence is observed. The matching and mixing with large-
momentum effective ﬁeld theory are in progress. The unrenormalized result at p2 = 4 GeV2 with
O(a2) correction gives SG = 0.13(3).

Glue Spin/Helicity in Nuclueon

Yi-Bo Yang

Deep-inelastic experiments revealed that, contrary to the naive quark model picture, the quark
spin contribution to proton spin is quite small, about 25% [1]. Recent analysis [2, 3] of the high-
statistics 2009 STAR [4] and PHENIX [5] experiments at RHIC showed evidence of non-zero glue
helicity in the proton, ∆g. For Q2 = 10 GeV2, the glue helicity distribution ∆g(x,Q2) is found
to be positive and away from zero in the momentum fraction region 0.05 ≤ x ≤ 1 (speciﬁcally
0.05 ≤ x ≤ 0.2, the region in which RHIC can determine ∆g(x) much better than the other regions).
However, the results have very large uncertainty in the region x ≤ 0.05.

Given the importance of ∆g to address the origin of the proton spin, and the fact that large
efforts are devoted to a precise experimental determination, a theoretical understanding and esti-
mation of ∆g is highly desired. In the inﬁnite momentum frame (IMF), the total glue helicity which

|PS(cid:105), with momentum Pµ and polarization Sµ. The light cone gauge-link L (ξ −,0) is in the adjoint
representation. It connects the gauge ﬁeld tensor and its dual, ˜Fαβ = 1
2εαβ µνFµν, to construct a
gauge invariant operator. After integrating the longitudinal momentum x, the light-cone operator
for the matrix element has the following non-local expression [7, 8],

In principle, one cannot evaluate this expression in the light-front frame on the lattice due to its

It is shown in [8] that when boosting the glue spin operator (cid:126)Sg in Eq. (3) to IMF, the condition
+ = 0 and the forward matrix

Eq. (7) corresponds to the light-cone gauge ﬁxing condition Aphys
element of the longitudinal glue spin operator corresponds to the glue helicity, ∆G.

In contrast to the deﬁnition of the glue helicity operator in the IMF, the matrix element of the
glue spin operator in the ﬁnite momentum frame is calculable in lattice QCD. Solutions for Aphys
and Apure
satisfying Eqs. (5-7) can be obtained through a gauge link ﬁxed in the Coulomb gauge
under a gauge transformation gC(x),

In order to extract the glue spin contributions to the nucleon, we compute the ratio of the
disconnected three-point function to the two-point function with the source and sink of the nucleon
propagator located at t0 and t, respectively. The glue spin operator is inserted at the time slice t(cid:48)
between t0 and t. Then the ratio of the disconnected insertion three-point function to two-point
function in the moving frame along the z direction is,

3 /Γe is the polarized/unpolarized projection matrix
where χ is the nucleon interpolation ﬁeld and Γm
of the proton respectively. The signal to noise ratio (SNR) can be improved by using the summed
ratio method [15] and we denote the summed ratio by SR(t,t0) = ∑t−1
t(cid:48)=t0+1 R(t,t(cid:48),t0). SR(t,t0) has a
linear behavior in the region where t is large enough that excited-state contamination is negligible,

SR(t −t0) ≡ SR(t,t0) −−→

t(cid:29)1 C0 + (t −t0)SG + O(e−∆E(t−t0)),

(12)

where SG is the matrix element of the longitudinal glue spin operator in the proton.

A preliminary attempt [13] to calculate SG on the lattice following the above prescription has
been carried out on 2 + 1 ﬂavor dynamical domain-wall conﬁgurations on a 243 × 64 lattice (24I)
with the sea pion mass at 330 MeV. In this proceeding, we improve the statistics on the ensemble

(blue dots) cases, at the unitary point of the 24I ensemble. Linear behaviors are observed, starting from t=4.

Upon incorporating these improvements, we see a clear linear behavior of the ratio SR(t) as
a function of time, which indicates that excited state contamination is negligible, thus allowing a
clean and reliable extraction of the matrix element. Fig. 2 shows the case of the unitary point of the
24I ensemble, as an example.

The valence quark mass dependence is mild regardless the momentum involved, as in Fig. 3,
which shows the case for the 24I ensemble. The sea quark mass dependence is not explored in this
proceeding, and will be investigated in the future.

The glue helicity in proton spin, ∆G, corresponds to the glue longitudinal spin component SG
in the inﬁnite momentum frame. An equivalent approach [17] is matching the glue spin under a
regularization in a ﬁnite momentum frame (such as the lattice regularization) at a relatively large

from the other regions is negligible.
