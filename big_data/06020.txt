Abstract

Quandle 2-cocycles deﬁne invariants of classical and virtual knots, and extensions of quandles.
We show that the quandle 2-cocycle invariant with respect to a non-trivial 2-cocycle is constant,
or takes some other restricted form, for classical knots when the corresponding extensions satisfy
certain algebraic conditions. In particular, if an abelian extension is a conjugation quandle, then
the corresponding cocycle invariant is constant. Speciﬁc examples are presented from the list
of connected quandles of order less than 48. Relations among various quandle epimorphisms
involved are also examined.

Key words: quandles, quandle cocycle invariants, abelian extensions of quandles

Introduction

Sets with certain self-distributive operations called quandles have been studied since the 1940s [26],
and have been applied to knot theory since early 1980s [19, 22]. The number of colorings of knot
diagrams by quandle elements, in particular, has been widely used as a knot invariant. Algebraic
homology theories for quandles were deﬁned [3,16], and investigated. Knot invariants using cocycles
have been deﬁned [3] and applied to knots and knotted surfaces [6]. Extensions of quandles by
cocycles have been studied, for example, in [1, 2, 14].

Computations by Vendramin [28] signiﬁcantly expanded the list of small connected quandles.
These quandles, called here Rig quandles, may be found in the GAP package Rig [27]. Rig includes
all connected quandles of order less than 48, at this time. Properties of some of Rig quandles, such
as homology groups and cocycle invariants, are also found in [27]. We use the notation Q(n, i) for
the i-th quandle of order n in the list of Rig quandles.

It was observed that some Rig quandles have non-trivial second cohomology, yet have constant
2-cocycle invariants with non-trivial 2-cocycles, as much as computer calculations have been per-
formed for the knot table (Remark 4.5, [11]). It does not seem to have been established previously
whether they actually have constant values for all classical knots. From Theorem 5.5 in [7], any
non-trivial 2-cocycle has non-constant invariant values for some virtual links. Thus it is of interest
if these quandles actually have constant values for all classical knots. More generally, possible
values of the cocycle invariants are largely unknown, and are of interest. In this paper, we show
that certain algebraic properties of quandles imply that the cocycle invariant is constant, or takes

1

some restricted form, for classical knots. In particular, we prove that several speciﬁc Rig quandles,
including some of those conjectured in [11], have constant cocycle invariant values for all classical
knots for some non-trivial 2-cocycles.

In Section 2, deﬁnitions, terminology and lemmas are presented. The main results and corol-
laries, and their proofs are given in Section 3. Conjugation quandles are discussed in Sections 4
and 5. Relations among various epimorphisms used in the proofs are examined in Secition 6.

2 Preliminaries

In this section we brieﬂy review some deﬁnitions and examples. More details can be found, for
example, in [6].

A quandle X is a set with a binary operation (a, b) 7→ a ∗ b satisfying the following conditions.

(Idempotency)

For any a ∈ X, a ∗ a = a.

(1)

(Right invertibility)

For any b, c ∈ X, there is a unique a ∈ X such that a ∗ b = c. (2)

(Right self-distributivity)

For any a, b, c ∈ X, we have (a ∗ b) ∗ c = (a ∗ c) ∗ (b ∗ c).

(3)

A quandle homomorphism between two quandles X, Y is a map f : X → Y such that f (x ∗X y) =
f (x) ∗Y f (y), where ∗X and ∗Y denote the quandle operations of X and Y , respectively. A quandle
isomorphism is a bijective quandle homomorphism, and two quandles are isomorphic if there is
a quandle isomorphism between them. A quandle epimorphism f : X → Y is a covering [14] if
f (x) = f (y) implies a ∗ x = a ∗ y for all a, x, y ∈ X.

Let X be a quandle. The right translation Ra : X → X, by a ∈ X, is deﬁned by Ra(x) = x ∗ a
for x ∈ X. Then Ra is an automorphism of X by Axioms (2) and (3). The subgroup of Sym(X)
generated by the permutations Ra, a ∈ X, is called the inner automorphism group of X, and is
denoted by Inn(X). The map inn : X → inn(X) ⊂ Inn(X) deﬁned by inn(x) = Rx is called the
inner representation. An inner representation is a covering.

A quandle is connected if Inn(X) acts transitively on X. A quandle is faithful if the mapping

inn : X → Inn(X) is an injection.

As in Joyce [19] a quandle is deﬁned by a pair (G, f ) where G is a group, f ∈ Aut(G), and the
quandle operation is deﬁned by x ∗ y = f (xy−1)y, x, y ∈ G. We call such a quandle a generalized
Alexander quandle and denote it by GAlex(G, f ). If G is abelian, such a quandle is known as an
Alexander quandle.

In this paper all quandles are assumed to be ﬁnite.

Figure 1: Colored crossings and cocycle weights

Let D be a diagram of a knot K, and A(D) be the set of arcs of D. A coloring of a knot diagram
D by a quandle X is a map C : A(D) → X satisfying the condition depicted in Figure 1 at every

2

positive (left) and negative (right) crossing τ , respectively. The pair (xτ , yτ ) of colors assigned to
a pair of nearby arcs of a crossing τ is called the source colors, and the third arc is required to
receive the color xτ ∗ yτ .

In this paper we denote by A a ﬁnite multiplicative abelian group whose identity element is
denoted by 1. A function φ : X × X → A for an abelian group A is called a quandle 2-cocycle [3]
if it satisﬁes

φ(x, y)φ(x, z)−1φ(x ∗ y, z)φ(x ∗ z, y ∗ z)−1 = 1

for any x, y, z ∈ X and φ(x, x) = 1 for any x ∈ X. For a quandle 2-cocycle φ, E = X × A becomes
a quandle by setting

(x, a) ∗ (y, b) = (x ∗ y, a φ(x, y))

for x, y ∈ X, a, b ∈ A, denoted by E(X, A, φ) or simply E(X, A), and it is called an abelian
extension of X by A. Let π : E(X, A) = X × A → X be the projection to the ﬁrst factor. We also
say that a quandle epimorphism f : Y → Z is an abelian extension if there exists a isomorphisms
ν : E(X, A) → Y and h : X → Z such that hπ = f ν. An abelian extension is a covering. See [2]
for more information on abelian extensions of quandles and [3–5] for more on quandle cohomology.
Let X be a quandle, and φ be a 2-cocycle with coeﬃcient group A, a ﬁnite abelian group. Let
D be a diagram of a knot K. The 2-cocycle (or cocycle, for short) invariant is an element of the
group ring Z[A] deﬁned by Φ(X,A,φ)(D) = Φφ(D) = PC Qτ φ(xτ , yτ )ǫ(τ ), where the product ranges
over all crossings τ , the sum ranges over all colorings of a given knot diagram, (xτ , yτ ) are source
colors at the crossing τ , and ǫ(τ ) is the sign of τ as speciﬁed in Figure 1. For a given coloring
C, the element Qτ φ(xτ , yτ )ǫ(τ ) ∈ A is denoted by Bφ(D, C). For an abelian group A, the cocycle
invariant takes the form Pa∈A naa where na ∈ Z, and it is constant if na = 0 when a is not the
identity of A. It is known [3] that Φφ(D) is independent of choice of diagram D for a knot K. Thus
we have the 2-cocycle invariant Φ(X,A,φ)(K) = Φφ(K) = Φφ(D).

A 1-tangle is a properly embedded arc in a 3-ball, and the equivalence of 1-tangles is deﬁned
by ambient isotopies of the 3-ball ﬁxing the boundary (cf. [12]). A diagram of a 1-tangle is deﬁned
in a manner similar to a knot diagram, from a regular projection to a disk by specifying crossing
information, see Figure 2(A). An orientation of a 1-tangle is speciﬁed by an arrow on a diagram
as depicted. A knot diagram is obtained from a 1-tangle diagram by closing the end points by a
trivial arc outside of a disk. This procedure is called the closure of a 1-tangle.
If a 1-tangle is
oriented, then the closure inherits the orientation. Two diagrams of the same 1-tangle are related
by Reidemeister moves. There is a bijection between knots and 1-tangles for classical knots, and
invariants of 1-tangles give rise to invariants of knots, see [14], for example.

A 1-tangle is obtained from a knot K as follows. Choose a base point b ∈ K and a small closed
ball neighborhood B of b in the 3-sphere S3 such that (B, K ∩ B) is a trivial ball-arc pair (so that
K ∩ B is unknotted in B, see Figure 2(B)). Then (S3 \ Int(B), K ∩ (S3 \ Int(B))) is a 1-tangle called
the 1-tangle associated with K. The resulting 1-tangle does not depend on the choice of a base
point. If a knot is oriented, then the corresponding 1-tangle inherits the orientation.

A quandle coloring of an oriented 1-tangle diagram is deﬁned in a manner similar to those for
knots. We do not require that the end points receive the same color for a quandle coloring of
1-tangle diagrams. As in [11] we say that a quandle X is end monochromatic for a tangle diagram
T if any coloring of T by X assigns the same color on the two end arcs. We use the same notations
Φφ(T ) = PC Qτ φ(xτ , yτ )ǫ(τ ) and Bφ(T, C) for tangle diagrams T . This Φφ(T ) is again independent
of choice of a diagram, and an invariant of tangles. Figures 1, 2, 3 are taken from [11].

Figure 3: Colorings of a tangle

We recall the following two lemmas.

Lemma 2.1 (Eisermann [14], Theorem 30). Let f : Y → X be a covering, and CX : A(T ) → X
be a coloring of a 1-tangle T by X. Let b0, b1 be the top and bottom arcs as depicted in Figure 3.
Then for any y ∈ Y such that f (y) = CX(b0), there exists a unique coloring CY : A(T ) → Y such
that f CY = CX and CY (b0) = y.

Lemma 2.2 ( [2, 11] ). Let E = E(X, A, φ) be an abelian extension for a 2-cocycle φ. Then E is
end monochromatic T if and only if Φ(X,A,φ)(K) is constant, where T is a 1-tangle for a knot K.

Lemma 2.3. Let C : A(T ) → Y be a coloring of a classical 1-tangle diagram T by a quandle Y .
For the top and bottom arcs b0 and b1 of T , respectively, let y0 = C(b0) and y1 = C(b1). Then
inn(y0) = Ry0 = Ry1 = inn(y1).

Proof. The proof in [11], based on corresponding statements in [23–25] on faithful quandles, applies
in this situation. The idea of proof is seen in Figure 3. The large circle behind the tangle T in the
ﬁgure can be pulled out of T if T corresponds to a classical knot. Colorings of tangle diagrams can
be deﬁned when a tangle has more than one component, in a similar manner. Hence any color y at
the left of the large circle should extend to the color to the right, so that for the colors y0 and y1
for the top and bottom arcs b0 and b1 must satisfy y ∗ y0 = y ∗ y1, hence we obtain Ry0 = Ry1.

Remark 2.4. To see that the condition of being a classical knot is essential, we observe examples
of long virtual knots (i.e., virtual 1-tangles) for which the conclusion of Lemma 2.3 does not hold.

See [21], for example, for long virtual knots. Colorings of oriented virtual (and long virtual) knots
are deﬁned in a manner similar to classical knots, with colors unchanged for each transverse arc at
each virtual crossing [20]. Suppose a (virtual or classical) knot diagram D is colored non-trivially
by a faithful quandle X, and let τ be a non-trivially colored crossing (that is, distinct colors appear
at τ ). Since X is faithful, all three colors at τ are distinct (see Figure 4(A) left). Make τ a virtual
crossing (called virtualization of a crossing) as in the middle of (A), and cut and prolong one of the
under-arcs up and down, to make a long virtual knot (a virtual 1-tangle), as in (A) right. A cut
point is indicated by a dot in (A) middle. Prolonged arcs cross other arcs by virtual crossings. Then
the top and bottom arcs are colored by elements a, c ∈ X such that Ra 6= Rc. Thus the resulting
long virtual knot is not classical. An example of this construction is illustrated in Figure 4(B) with
a Fox tri-coloring. The quandle used here is Z3 with a ∗ b = 2b − a mod 3, a well known dihedral
quandle of order 3, which is faithful.

3 Cocycle invariants and the images of inner representations

In this section we present relations between certain algebraic properties of quandles and values of
the quandle cocycle invariant. We do not assume connectivity of quandles in this section unless
otherwise speciﬁed.

Theorem 3.1. Let E = E(X, A, φ) be an abelian extension of a quandle X. If E ∼= inn(Y ) for
some quandle Y , then Φ(X,A,φ)(K) is constant for all classical knots K.

Proof. Let T be a 1-tangle of K, b0, b1 be the top and bottom arcs of T , respectively. Let C be a
coloring of a diagram of K by X, and use the same notation C : A(T ) → X for a corresponding
coloring of T such that C(b0) = C(b1) = x ∈ X. Then C extends to a coloring CE : A(T ) → E by
Lemma 2.1.

Recall that the inner representation is a covering. Without loss of generality, we assume that

5

inn(Y ) = E. By assumption and Lemma 2.1, CE extends to a coloring CY . Since E is an abelian
extension of X, Lemma 2.2 and Lemma 2.3 imply that the cocycle invariant is constant.

To apply the theorem to some Rig quandles, we observe the following.

Lemma 3.2. If inn : Y → inn(Y ) = X, for connected quandles X and Y , satisﬁes |Y |/|X| = 2,
then inn is an abelian extension.

Proof. For inn : Y → inn(Y ) = X, where X and Y are connected quandles, it is proved in [1] that
there is a quandle isomorphism ν : X × S → Y for a set S, such that π = inn(ν) for the projection
π : X × S → X. The quandle operation on X × S is deﬁned by

(x, s) ∗ (y, t) = (x ∗ y, βx,y(s))

for

(x, s), (y, t) ∈ X × S,

for some β : X 2 → Sym(S). The proof of Theorem 7.1 of [11] shows that if the cardinality of S is
2, then we can assume S = Z2 and βx,y(a) = a φ(x, y) where φ is a 2-cocycle with coeﬃcient group
A = Z2. Hence inn is an abelian extension.

We say that an epimorphism f : Y → X is of index k if |Y |/|X| = k. Note that if Y is

connected, then each ﬁber f −1(x), x ∈ X, has cardinality k.

Corollary 3.3. The following Rig quandles have non-trivial second cohomology groups with the
coeﬃcient group A = Z2, yet give rise to constant quandle 2-cocycle invariants for any classical
knot with the corresponding non-trivial 2-cocycles:

Q(6, 1),
Q(10, 1), Q(12, 5), Q(12, 6), Q(12, 7), Q(12, 8), Q(16, 4), Q(16, 5),
Q(16, 6), Q(18, 1), Q(18, 2), Q(18, 8), Q(18, 9), Q(18, 10), Q(24, 3), Q(24, 4),
Q(24, 13), Q(24, 22), Q(30, 2), Q(30, 7), Q(30, 8), Q(40, 8), Q(40, 9), Q(40, 10),
Q(42, 1), Q(42, 3), Q(42, 4), Q(42, 7), Q(42, 8).

Proof. Computer calculations show the following quandle sequences of Rig quandles:

Q(24, 1)

Q(40, 2)

inn
−→ Q(12, 1)
inn
−→ Q(20, 3)

inn
−→ Q(6, 1),
inn
−→ Q(10, 1).

For example, the ﬁrst sequence shows that Q(12, 1) is an abelian extension of Q(6, 1) by a cocycle
φ, and is the image of Q(24, 1) by inn. Then Lemma 3.2 and Theorem 3.1 imply that Φφ(K) is
constant for all classical knots K. For the other quandles, the result follows in a similar fashion
from sequences of inner representations in Tables 1 and 2. See [10] for multiplication tables of
quandles in Tables 1 and 2.

R(192, 2) → R(48, 3) → Q(24, 3) → Q(12, 6)
R(192, 3) → R(48, 4) → Q(24, 4) → Q(12, 5)

were conjectured in [11] to have constant quandle 2-cocycle invariants for any classical knot with

R(216, 3) → Q(36, 1) → Q(18, 1)

Table 2: Three-term sequences of inner representations for small connected quandles

non-trivial 2-cocycles except Q(15, 2), and Q(15, 7), which will be shown to have constant invariant
in Section 5. Those in the above list of order larger than 16 do not appear in the conjectured list
in [11].

Tables 1 and 2 contain sequences of connected quandles where all arrows represent inner repres-
entations. The quandle on the left of each sequence is a generalized Alexander quandle, but others
in the sequence may or may not be generalized Alexander quandles. The right-most quandle in
each sequence is faithful, so the sequences cannot be extended non-trivially to the right with inner
representations. The notation R(n, j) is used to indicate a quandle of order n when n > 47 and
hence not a Rig quandle. The index j is simply to distinguish non-isomorphic quandles.

Remark 3.4. Terminating sequences of inn,

X = X0

inn−→ X1 = inn(X0) inn−→ · · ·

inn−→ Xn = inn(Xn−1),

are discussed in [1], where Xn is faithful and Xj are not, for j = 1, . . . , n − 1. For the 790 Rig
quandles of order less than 48, there are 66 non-faithful quandles X, and all but two have faithful
images inn(X). The two exceptions are the above ﬁrst two Rig quandles Q(24, 1) and Q(40, 2) in
Corollary 3.3.

On the other hand, Tables 1 and 2 include many quandles X with inn(X) being non-faithful

Rig quandles.

Let X = Q(12, 5) or Q(12, 6). Then the second quandle cohomology group H 2

Q(X, Z4) is
known [27] to be isomorphic to Z4. See [3, 6], for example, for details on quandle cohomology.

7

Q(X, Z4) ∼= Z4. Let u denote
Let ψ : X × X → Z4 be a 2-cocycle which represents a generator of H 2
a multiplicative generator of A = Z4. The cocycle invariants Φψ(K) for X = Q(12, 5) or Q(12, 6)
with respect to ψ, computed for some knots in the table in [27] up to 9 crossing knots, contain
non-constant values, while for A = Z2 the invariant is constant by Corollary 3.3. This is explained
by the following.

Theorem 3.5. Let X be a quandle and n, m, d > 1 be positive integers such that n = md. Let ψ
be a 2-cocycle of X with values in Zn, and Φψ(K) = Pn−1
j=0 aj(K) uj be the cocycle invariant of a
knot K with respect to ψ.

Let E = E(X, Zm, φ) α→ X be the abelian extension corresponding to φ = ψd, and suppose that
α
→ X. Then ak(K) = 0 for all k that are not divisible by

inn
−→ E

there is a sequence of quandles Y
m, for any classical knot K.

Proof. For each coloring C : A(T ) → X, the weight φ(xτ , yτ )ǫ(τ ) at a crossing τ for φ is equal to
ψ(xτ , yτ )dǫ(τ ). Hence if Bψ(T, C) = uj, then we have Bφ(T, C) = udj. Then

The following solves a conjecture stated in [11].

Corollary 3.6. Let X = Q(12, 5) or Q(12, 6), and ψ : X × X → A = Z4 be a 2-cocycle which
represents a generator of H 2
j=0 aj(K) uj ∈ Z[A] be the cocycle
invariant. Then a1(K) = a3(K) = 0 for any classical knot K.

Q(X, Z4) ∼= Z4. Let Φψ(K) = P3

This situation is also found for X = Q(18, 1) or Q(18, 8), where H 2

Q(X, Z6) ∼= Z6. Let u be a
multiplicative generator of A = Z6. Then the invariant values are restricted to the following form.

Corollary 3.7. Let X = Q(18, 1) or Q(18, 8), and ψ : X × X → Z6 be a 2-cocycle which represents
a generator of H 2
j=0 aj(K) uj ∈ Z[A] be the cocycle invariant.
Then ak(K) = 0 for k = 1, 3, 5 for any classical knot K.

Q(X, Z6) ∼= Z6. Let Φψ(K) = P5

The cocycle invariant for connected quandles of order 18 are computed in [27] for up to 7
crossing knots at the time of writing. The invariant values for Q(18, 8) do contain non-constant
values. For Q(18, 1), the invariant is constant, and we do not know whether this is an artifact of
limited number of knots or it is constant for all classical knots.

Theorem 3.1 can be applied contrapositively: if E → X is an abelian extension with a 2-cocycle
φ such that Φφ(K) is not constant for a classical knot K, then there is no ﬁnite quandle Y such

8

that inn(Y ) = E for the inner representation inn. Thus we obtain the following from [8] and [27].
The list contains abelian extension E(X, Z2, φ) such that Φφ(K) is non-constant for some knot K
in the table. The list is from the information available at the time of writing.

Corollary 3.8. For the following Rig quandles E, there is no ﬁnite quandle Y such that inn(Y ) = E
for the inner representation inn:

Q(8, 1), Q(24, 1), Q(24, 7), Q(32, 1).

The arguments in Corollary 3.6 can be applied contrapositively to obtain the following as well.

Corollary 3.9. Let E be one of the Rig quandles Q(12, 2), Q(36, 1) or Q(32, 9). Then there is no
ﬁnite quandle Y such that inn(Y ) = E for the inner representation inn.

Proof. Each of the Rig quandles Q(6, 2), Q(16, 1), Q(16, 7) has the second cohomology group iso-
morphic to Z4. It is computed in [8] that the index 2 abelian extensions corresponding to ψ2 for
a 2-cocycle ψ representing a generator of the second cohomology group are, respectively, Q(12, 2),
Q(36, 1), and Q(32, 9).

Let E be one of Q(12, 2), Q(36, 1), and Q(32, 9).

If there is a ﬁnite quandle Y such that
inn(Y ) = E, then by the proof of Corollary 3.6, the cocycle invariant Φψ(K) = P3
j=0 aj(K) uj
satisﬁes a1(K) = a3(K) = 0 for all classical knots K. However, this is not the case from [27], and
the result follows.

Remark 3.10. Similar arguments apply to other Rig quandles for Q with cyclic second cohomology
groups, but the corresponding index 2 abelian extensions go out of bounds of Rig quandles, and
we are not able to specify the quandles with this property. However, we can conclude that for
each Rig quandle Q in the list given below, there is a non-trivial abelian extension α : X → Q of
index 2 with the property that there is no ﬁnite quandle Y such that inn(Y ) = X for the inner
representation inn:

Q(18, 3), Q(18, 6), Q(18, 7), Q(12, 10), Q(12, 3), Q(18, 5).

4 Φ(X,A,φ)(K) is constant if E(X, A, φ) is a conjugation quandle

Let G be a ﬁnite group. For a, b ∈ G we write ab = b−1ab and denote the conjugacy class of G
containing x by xG. The conjugacy class xG under conjugation, a ∗ b = ab, is a quandle. Here we
call such a quandle a conjugation quandle. We note that such a quandle need not be connected.
In general, a subquandle of a group G under conjugation need not be a conjugacy class. But it is
easy to see that if X is a subset of a group G closed under conjugation and if X under conjugation
is a connected quandle then X is a conjugacy class of the group hXi generated by X. Note that we
are only interested in this paper in the case where both X and G are ﬁnite.

We show in this section that a connected quandle E satisﬁes the condition in Theorem 3.1 if

and only if E is a conjugation quandle.

To simplify the proof of the next theorem we will need the following lemma.

Lemma 4.1. Suppose A, B, and C are quandles, f and g are quandle epimorphisms and h is a
well-deﬁned bijection such that g = hf , then h is a quandle isomorphism.

9

Proof. Let a1, a2 ∈ A. Since f is an epimorphism there exist c1, c2 ∈ B such that f (c1) = a1 and
f (c2) = a2. Then using g = hf we have h(a1 ∗ a2) = h(f (c1) ∗ f (c2)) = h(f (c1 ∗ c2)) = g(c1 ∗ c2) =
g(c1) ∗ g(c2) = hf (c1) ∗ hf (c2) = h(a1) ∗ h(a2).

Theorem 4.2. If X is a conjugation quandle, then X ∼= inn(Y ) for some quandle Y .

Proof. Let X = xG be a conjugation quandle for some ﬁnite group G and element x ∈ G. Deﬁne
f ∈ Aut(G) by f (a) = x−1ax, a ∈ G and let Y be the generalized Alexander quandle GAlex(G, f ).
Deﬁne p : Y → X by p(g) = xg. An easy calculation shows that p is a homomorphism. The
homomorphism p is clearly surjective as is the homomorphism inn : Y → inn(Y ). Now we claim
that the mapping ϕ : inn(Y ) → X given by ϕ(Rg) = xg is a bijection and hence by Lemma 4.1 it
is a quandle isomorphism. The see this we note that Rg = Rh holds if and only if a ∗ g = a ∗ h for
all a ∈ G. That is, if and only if x−1ag−1xg = x−1ah−1xh which by cancellation is equivalent to
xg = xh. This completes the proof.

Remark 4.3. We note that if Y is connected then X = inn(Y ) is a conjugacy class in Inn(Y ). So
for connected X the converse of Theorem 4.2 holds. In fact, by using Lemma 25 in [14] if X is a
connected conjugation quandle one may even ﬁnd a connected quandle Y such that X ∼= inn(Y ).
However, we do not assume connectivity for the results of this section.

The following is immediate from Theorems 3.1 and 4.2.

Theorem 4.4. If φ : Q × Q → A is a 2-cocycle of a quandle Q with an abelian coeﬃcient group
A such that the extension X = E(Q, A, φ) is a conjugation quandle, then Φφ(K) is constant for all
classical knots K.

Theorem 4.2 and Corollaries 3.8, 3.9 imply the following as well.

Corollary 4.5. The following Rig quandles are not conjugation quandles:

Q(8, 1), Q(12, 2), Q(24, 1), Q(24, 7), Q(32, 1), Q(32, 9), Q(36, 1).

5 A criterion for a ﬁnite connected quandle to be a conjugation

quandle

We are grateful to Leandro Vendramin for suggesting the criterion in this section for a connected
quandle to be a conjugation quandle and for pointing out the relevance of Lemma 1.8 in [18] to its
proof.

The development here is from the paper [18] by Vendramin and Heckenberger as well as the
paper [17]. For a (ﬁnite) quandle X = (X, ∗), its enveloping group is the group GX with presentation

GX = hxi, i ∈ X | xi∗j = x−1

j xixj, i, j ∈ Xi

and with the natural mapping

∂ : X → GX, i 7→ xi.

This group has been deﬁned and used several times previously, Joyce [19] denoted it by Adconj(X),
Fenn and Rourke called it the associated group and denoted it by As(X) [15], and Eisermann [13]

10

called it the adjoint group and denoted it by Adj(X). The group GX obtained from GX by adding
the relations xni
i , i ∈ X where ni is the order of Ri is called the ﬁnite enveloping group. That this
group is ﬁnite was proved in [17], Lemma 2.17. As in [18] we write

for the canonical surjection. Let

π : GX → GX

ρ : X → GX

be the natural mapping from X to GX , that is ρ = π∂. It is clear that ρ is a quandle homomorphism
to GX considered as a quandle under conjugation. Then we have the following theorem.

Theorem 5.1. (Vendramin’s Criterion [29]) A connected quandle X is a conjugation quandle if
and only if ρ : X → GX is an injection.

Proof. It is clear that the mapping ∂ : X → GX , i 7→ xi is universal for quandle homomorphisms
f : X → G where G is considered as a conjugation quandle. That is, for any such f there is a
unique group homomorphism g : GX → G such that f = g∂. It then follows that if f : X → G is
an injection, that is, if X is a conjugation quandle then ∂ must also be an injection. By Lemma
1.8 in [18] ∂ is injective implies that ρ is injective. Since X is connected the converse is clear.

Clearly each faithful connected quandle is a conjugation quandle. Among the 790 connected
quandles of order at most 47 there are precisely 66 non-faithful quandles. Using GAP/Rig and
Vendramin’s Criterion we ﬁnd that exactly 30 of the 66 non-faithful Rig quandes are conjugations
quandles. These are found in Table 3.

Q(12, 1) Q(20, 3) Q(24, 3) Q(24, 4) Q(24, 5) Q(24, 6)
Q(24, 14) Q(24, 16) Q(24, 17) Q(30, 1) Q(30, 16) Q(32, 5)
Q(32, 6) Q(32, 7) Q(32, 8) Q(36, 1) Q(36, 4) Q(36, 17)
Q(36, 20) Q(36, 21) Q(36, 28) Q(36, 30) Q(40, 12) Q(40, 13)
Q(40, 17) Q(40, 18) Q(40, 19) Q(40, 20) Q(42, 12) Q(42, 21)

Table 3: Non-faithful conjugation Rig quandles

These are listed in [9] together with groups in which they are conjugation quandles. Furthermore
each of these 30 quandles is an abelian extension of index 2 of the form inn : Q → inn(Q), as
indicated in Table 4. By Theorem 4.4 the corresponding cocycle invariants of these extensions are
constant for all knots. Note for example that Q(12, 8) has three diﬀerent such cocycle extensions.
This is possible since H 2

Q(X, Z2) ∼= Z2 × Z2 × Z2.

Remark 5.2. Some of the quandles in Table 3 are missed in Corollary 3.3 since they are homo-
morphic images under inn of quandles that are too large to be found easily with random searches.
We were able to identify these using Theorem 5.1.

Question 5.3. Is there a connected quandle Q with a 2-cocycle φ : Q × Q → A with |A| > 2 such
that E(Q, φ, A) is a conjugation quandle?

6 Relations among some types of epimorphisms

In this section, we examine relations among the epimorphisms used in the proofs of the main results;
coverings, abelian extensions and inner representations. As we pointed out, abelian extensions and
inner representations are coverings. We show that there is no other implication:

Proposition 6.1. (i) There exists an abelian extension that is not an inner representation.

(ii) There exists an inner representation that is not an abelian extension.
(iii) There exists a covering that is neither an abelian extension nor an inner representation.

Proof. (i) Suppose X is faithful, and let E = E(X, A) be an abelian extension. Then R(x,a) = R(y,b)
if and only if x = y, where (x, a), (y, b) ∈ E = X × A. Hence inn : E → inn(E) is an abelian
extension, where inn(E) is isomorphic to X. If there is a proper non-trivial subgroup C in A, then
in [11] it was proved that there is a sequence of abelian extensions E(X, A) → E(X, A/C) → X.
If X is faithful, therefore, E(X, A) → E(X, A/C) is not the inner representation. An example is
given by π : Q(24, 2) → Q(12, 2) where Q(24, 2) = E(Q(6, 2), Z4) and Q(24, 2) = E(Q(12, 2), Z2)
as noted in [11].

(ii) This was given in [11]: there it is shown that inn : Q(30, 4) → Q(10, 1) is not an abelian
2 (Q(10, 1)) ∼= Z2. Another proof that this is not an abelian extension follows

extension since H Q
from Lemma 6.2 below.

(iii) Consider the product of the two mappings mentioned above:

inn × π : Q(30, 4) × Q(24, 2) → Q(10, 1) × Q(12, 2),

where inn × π : (x, y) 7→ (inn(x), π(y)). We know that inn : Q(30, 4) → Q(10, 1) is an inner
representation that is not an abelian extension and π : Q(24, 2) → Q(12, 2) is an abelian extension
that is not an inner representation. We claim that inn×π is a covering but not an abelian extension
and not an inner representation.

12

To see that inn × π is not an inner representation note that if innZ denotes the inner represent-

ation on a quandle Z, then

innX×Y = innX × innY .

Thus since π is not an inner representation neither is inn × π.

Since both inn and π are coverings it is easy to see that their product is a covering. It is more

diﬃcult to show that inn × π is not an abelian extension. For this we use the following lemma.

Lemma 6.2. Let X and Y be ﬁnite quandles. Assume f : Y → X is an abelian extension, x ∈ X,
y ∈ f −1(x) and β ∈ Inn(Y ). If β(y) = y then β acts as the identity on the ﬁber f −1(x).

Proof. We take Y = E(X, A, φ) = X × A, and let π be the projection onto X. To simplify notation
we write the quandle products in X and Y by juxtaposition. Moreover, we deﬁne y1y2y3 = (y1y2)y3
and inductively, for n > 3 we set y1y2 · · · yn+1 = (y1y2 · · · yn)yn+1.

Since Y is ﬁnite for β ∈ Inn(Y ) we may write

β = R(xn,an)R(xn−1,an−2) · · · R(x1,a1).

Then we have for (z, b) ∈ X × A

β(z, b) = (z, b)(x1, a1)(x2, a2) · · · (xn, an).

Using the deﬁnition of the product in E(X, A, φ) it follows that

β(z, b) = (zx1x2 · · · xn, b φ(z, x1) φ(zx1, x2) · · · φ(zx1x2 · · · xn−1, xn)).

If we assume that β(z, b) = (z, b) then we have

zx1x2 · · · xn = z

and

φ(z, x1) φ(zx1, x2) · · · φ(zx1x2 · · · xn−1, xn) = 1.

The ﬁber π−1(z) is equal to {(z, c) : c ∈ A}. It follows that β(z, c) = (z, c) for all c ∈ A, that is, β
is the identity on the ﬁber π−1(z), as claimed.

Now returning to the claim that

inn × π : Q(30, 4) × Q(24, 2) → Q(10, 1) × Q(12, 2)

is not an abelian extension, we note ﬁrst that computation shows that for inn : Q(30, 4) → Q(10, 1)
there exist z ∈ Q(10, 1), α ∈ Inn(Q(30, 4)) and x, y ∈ inn−1(z) such that α(x) = x but α(y) 6= y.
This gives an alternative proof via Lemma 6.2 that inn : Q(30, 4) → Q(10, 1) is not an abelian
extension. Now to show that inn × π : Q(30, 4) × Q(24, 2) → Q(10, 1) × Q(12, 2) is not an abelian
extension, we note that using the same x and y we have that (x, w) and (y, w) for any w ∈ Q(24, 2)
lie in the same ﬁber of inn × π. It is easy to see that Inn(X × Y ) = Inn(X) × Inn(Y ) for any
quandles X and Y . Thus taking α ∈ Inn(Q(30, 4)) and the identity id ∈ Inn(Q(24, 2)) we have
that β = α × id ∈ Inn(Q(30, 4) × Q(24, 2)). Clearly β(x, w) = (x, w) and β(y, w) 6= (y, w). So by
Lemma 6.2 we have that inn × π is not an abelian extension.
