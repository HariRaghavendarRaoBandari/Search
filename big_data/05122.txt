Local solutions and twisted holomorphic proper

maps

Pan Ma Hansong Huang

Abstract: This paper mainly concerns the von Neumann algebras induced
by a tuple of multiplication operators on Bergman spaces which arise es-
sentially from holomorphic proper maps over higher dimensional domains.
It is known that in many interesting cases local inverse plays an important
role in this study. Local solution is deﬁned as a natural generalization of
local inverse, and one will see that how local solutions give rises to a local
inverse. Many examples are presented, and it turns out that there is a close
interplay between operator theory, algebra and geometry.

Keywords: von Neumann algebra; holomorphic proper map; local solution

Introduction

In this paper, D denotes the unit disk in the complex plane C, Bd denotes
the unit ball in Cd. Let Ω denote a bounded domain in the complex space
Cd, and dA be the Lebesgue measure on Ω. The Bergman space L2
a(Ω) is the
Hilbert space consisting of all holomorphic functions over Ω which are square
integrable with respect to the Lebesgue measure dA. For a holomorphic map
F : Ω → Cd, denote by J F the determinant of the Jacobian of F.
tiplication operator with the symbol φ on L2

For a bounded holomorphic function φ over Ω, let Mφ,Ω denote the mul-

a(Ω), given by

Mφ,Ωf = φf, f ∈ L2

a(Ω).

In general, for a tuple Φ = {φj : 1 ≤ j ≤ n}, let {MΦ,Ω}′ denote the commu-
tant of {Mφj ,Ω : 1 ≤ j ≤ n}, consisting of all bounded operators commuting
with each operator Mφj ,Ω(1 ≤ j ≤ n). Here, we emphasize that MΦ,Ω de-
notes a family of multiplication operators rather than a single vector-valued

1

multiplication operator. Let V ∗(Φ, Ω) denote the von Neumann algebra

{Mφj ,Ω, M ∗

φj ,Ω : 1 ≤ j ≤ n}′,

which consists of all bounded operators on L2
a(Ω) commuting with both
Mφj ,Ω and M ∗
φj ,Ω for each j. It is known that there is a close connection
between orthogonal projections in V ∗(Φ, Ω) and all adjoint reducing sub-
spaces of {Mφj ,Ω : 1 ≤ j ≤ n} [DSZ, GH1, GH4]. Precisely, the range
of an orthogonal projection in V ∗(Φ, Ω) is exactly an adjoint reducing sub-
spaces of {Mφj ,Ω : 1 ≤ j ≤ n}, and vice versa. We say that V ∗(Φ, Ω) is
trivial if V ∗(Φ, Ω) = CI. This is equivalent to that {Mφj ,Ω : 1 ≤ j ≤ n}
has no nonzero adjoint reducing subspace other than the whole space. In
single-variable case, investigations on commutants and reducing subspaces
of multiplication operators and von Neumann algebras induced by those
operators have been done in [Cow1, Cow2, Cow3, CW, DPW, GH1, GH2,
GH3, GH4, HZ, SZZ, T1, T2] and some special multi-variable cases have
been studied in [DH, GW, Ti, WDH].

Concerning the commutants of analytic Toeplitz operators, Thomson
[T1, Cow1] shows that for a holomorphic function φ over D, there exist a
ﬁnite Blaschke product B and an H ∞-function ψ such that φ = ψ(B) and
{Mφ}′ = {MB}′ hold on the Hardy space. Their techniques and results
naturally move to the Bergman space. In particular, in this case V ∗(φ, D) =
V ∗(B, D). The proof in [T1] rests heavily on the notion of (admissible) local
inverse, which has natural generalization in higher dimension case. For an
admissible local inverse ρ, let [ρ] denote the equivalence of ρ in the sense of
analytic continuation. Then deﬁne

E[ρ]h = Xσ∈[ρ]

h ◦ σJ σ, h ∈ L2

a(D),

(1.1)

where [ρ] denote the equivalent class of ρ, consisting of all analytic continu-
ations of ρ, and the sum in (1.1) involves only ﬁnitely many terms. In [HZ],
Zheng and the second author obtained some results on V ∗(Φ, Ω) in higher
dimensional case. Let Φ : Ω → Cd be a holomorphic map on Ω and the
image of Φ contains an interior point. Then V ∗(Φ, Ω) is a ﬁnite dimensional
von Neumann algebra. Furthermore, in this case V ∗(Φ, Ω) is generated by
E[ρ], where ρ run over admissible local inverses of Φ. Also, similar results
also hold if Φ is a holomorphic proper map [HZ], see Theorems 3.2 and 3.3.
This paper mainly gives some examples and extensions of the works
in [HZ]. First, we give some examples of holomorphic maps Φ and study
V ∗(Φ, Ω).
It is shown that the structure of V ∗(Φ, Ω) can have links with

2

algebra. Precisely, let A denote a d× d Z+-entry matrix, and let α1,··· , αd
be d raw vectors from A.

ΦA(z) = (zα1

,··· , zαd

), z ∈ Dd.

We have the following.

Theorem 1.1. Suppose ΦA is deﬁned as above. Then we have

dimV ∗(ΦA, Dd) < ∞

if and only if det A 6= 0. Furthermore, V ∗(ΦA, Dd) is trivial if and only if A
is a unimodular matrix.

Also, one can show that ΦA is a holomorphic proper map if and only if

det AΦ 6= 0. In this case, V ∗(ΦA, Dd) is abelian.

Before continuing, we pose two properties of a domain Ω [HZ]:

(1) The boundary ∂Ω of Ω is of Lebesgue measure zero in Cd;

(2) For each point ζ ∈ ∂Ω and any open neighborhood O(ζ) of ζ, O(ζ)− Ω

contains an open ball.

Some results in [HZ] require Ω have properties (1) and (2) at least technically,
and there are many domains satisfy both (1) and (2) [HZ]. Throughout this
paper, for convenience we always assume that Ω is a bounded domain in
Cd with properties (1) and (2).

In this paper, we introduce a notion called local solution, a natural
generalization of local inverse. For two holomorphic maps Φ and Ψ from Ω
to Cd, if there is a subdomain ∆ of Ω and a holomorphic function ρ over ∆
such that

Ψ(ρ(z)) = Φ(z), z ∈ ∆,

then ρ is called a local solution. If Φ and Ψ are holomorphic proper maps
over Ω, one can deﬁne a complex manifold SΦ,Ψ, which equals

{(z, w) ∈ Ω : Ψ(w) = Φ(z)}

minus some small subset. This is inspired by the Riemann surface SB,B
deﬁned in [GSZZ]. It turns out that all related admissible local solutions
have a close link with SΦ,Ψ. In addition, we deﬁne a holomorphic map FΦ,Ψ.
For convenience, let Ω be a domain in C2 and

Φ(z1, z2) = (φ1(z1, z2), φ2(z1, z2)), Ψ(z1, z2) = (ψ1(z1, z2), ψ2(z1, z2)),

3

where (z1, z2) ∈ Ω. Write P (z) = (z1 +··· + z4,Pj<k zj zk,··· , Π4

FΦ,Ψ is deﬁned by

j=1zj), and

FΦ,Ψ(z1, z2, z3, z4) = P ◦(cid:0)Φ(z1, z2), Ψ(z3, z4)(cid:1), (z1, z2, z3, z4) ∈ Ω2.

Then we have the following.

Theorem 1.2. Suppose Φ and Ψ are two holomorphic proper maps over Ω
such that Φ(Ω) 6= Ψ(Ω), and both Φ and Ψ are holomorphic on Ω. Assume
that FΦ,Ψ has no nontrivial compatible equation. Then V ∗(FΦ,Ψ, Ω2) is ∗-
isomorphic to V ∗(Φ, Ω) ⊗ V ∗(Ψ, Ω).
Theorem 1.2 still holds if Ω is a domain in Cd(d ≥ 1). The condition of
FΦ,Ψ having no nontrivial compatible equation is quite geometric, and such
a condition is easy to check, see below (5.5).

By similar methods, we also obtain the following result: for holomorphic
functions f and g over D, if f (D) 6= g(D), then V ∗(f (z1)+g(z2), f (z1)g(z2), D2)
is ∗-isomorphic to V ∗(f, D) ⊗ V ∗(g, D) (Proposition 5.5). With a bit more
eﬀort, one sees this von Neumann algebra is abelian. But this fails if both
f and g are replaced with ﬁnite Blaschke products.

In fact, we have the following result, which shows that abelian property
of V ∗(ΦB1,B2 , D2) rests on the connectedness of the Riemann surface SB1,B2.
Theorem 1.3. Write ΦB1,B2(z) = (B1(z1) + B2(z2), B1(z1)B2(z2)), where
both B1 and B2 are ﬁnite Blaschke products. Then ΦB1,B2 is a holomorphic
proper map on D2. Furthermore, V ∗(ΦB1,B2 , D2) is abelian if and only if
SB1,B2 is connected.

As a special case of Theorem 1.3, V ∗(zk

2, D2) is abelian if and
only if GCD(k, l) = 1, see Example 6.2. Besides, Theorem 1.3 fails if d
(d ≥ 3) twisted ﬁnite Blaschke products are involved, see Example 6.3.
Last but not the least, the structure of V ∗(FΦ,Ψ, Ω2) is determined by
If in Theorem 1.2 the condition
admissible local inverses of FΦ,Ψ [HZ].
Φ(Ω) 6= Ψ(Ω) is replaced with Φ(Ω) = Ψ(Ω), it turns out that some admis-
sible local solutions for SΦ,Ψ and SΨ,Φ give rise to admissible local inverses
of FΦ,Ψ, see Theorem 5.3.

This paper is arranged as follows.
In Section 2 we give some preliminaries. Section 3 gives the deﬁnition
and some properties of local solution. Also included are some results from
[HZ] on von Neumann algebras V ∗(Φ, Ω), where Φ is a holomorphic map
from Ω to Cd. In Section 4 we present some examples of V ∗(Φ, Ω) and the
proof of Theorem 1.1 is provided. Section 5 mainly focuses on two twisted

4

holomorphic proper maps and present The proof of Theorem 1.2. Section 6
mainly establishes Theorem 1.3 and gives some examples for it. As is shown,
there is an interplay between operator theory and geometry.

2 Some preliminaries

This section gives some preliminaries, including proper map, zero variety
and local inverse, which will be useful later.

Let Ω, Ω′, Ω′′ be domains in Cd. A holomorphic function Ψ : Ω′ → Ω′′ is
called a proper map if for any sequence {pn}(pn ∈ Ω′) without limit point
in Ω′, {Ψ(pn)} has no limit point in Ω′. This is equivalent to say that each
compact subset K of Ω′, Ψ−1(K) is compact. A holomorphic function Ψ on
Ω is called proper if Ψ(Ω) is open and Ψ : Ω → f (Ω) is proper. In particular,
if Ψ is holomorphic on Ω, then Ψ is proper on Ω if and only if Ψ(Ω) is open
and

A holomorphic map Φ from Dd to Dd is proper if and only if up to a per-
mutation of coordinates

Ψ(∂Ω) ⊆ ∂Ψ(Ω).

Φ(z) = (φ1(z1),··· , φd(zd)),

where each φj(1 ≤ j ≤ d) is a ﬁnite Blaschke product [Ru1, Theorem 7.3.3].
In general, a holomorphic proper map is open, which easily follows from
[Ru2, Theorem 15.1.6], see the following.
Theorem 2.1. Suppose F : Ω → Cd is a holomorphic function and for each
w ∈ Cd, F −1(w) is compact. Then F is an open map.

Let F : Ω → Cd be a holomorphic map and Z denotes the zeros of
the determinant of the Jacobian of F . Then its image F (Z) is called the
critical set of F . Each point in F (Z) is called a critical value, and each
point in F (Ω) − F (Z) is called a regular point. A holomorphic proper map
is always an m-folds map, and its critical set a zero variety, see as follows
[Ru2, Theorem 15.1.9].
Theorem 2.2. Given two domains Ω and Ω′ in Cd, suppose F : Ω → Ω′
is a holomorphic proper function. Let ♯(w) denote the number of points in
F −1(w) with w ∈ Ω′. Then the following hold:
(1) There is an integer m such that ♯(w) = m for all regular values w of

F and ♯(w′) < m for all critical values w′ of F ;

5

(2) The critical set of F is a zero variety in Ω′.

A subset E of Ω is called a zero variety of Ω if there is a nonconstant
holomorphic function f on Ω such that E = {z ∈ Ω|f (z) = 0}. A relatively
closed subset V of Ω is called an (analytic) subvariety of Ω if for each point w
in Ω there is a neighborhood N of w such that V ∩N equals the intersection
of zeros of ﬁnitely many holomorphic functions over N .
An easier version of Remmert’s Proper Mapping Theorem reads as fol-
lows, see [Ch, p. 65] or [Re1, Re2].
Theorem 2.3. If f : Ω′ → Ω′′ is a holomorphic proper map and Z is a
subvariety of Ω′, then f (Z) is a subvariety of Ω′′.

Here we recall a basic lemma, which follows directly from Theorem 2.1.
Lemma 2.4. Suppose Φ : Ω → Cd is holomorphic on Ω. If all local inverses
of Φ are members of Aut(Ω), then Φ is open and Φ : Ω → Φ(Ω) is a
holomorphic proper map.

We need some notations about analytic continuation [Ru3, Chapter 16].
A function element is an ordered pair (f, D), where D is a simply-connected
open set and f is a holomorphic function on D. Two function elements
(f0, D0) and (f1, D1) are called direct continuations if D0 ∩ D1 is not empty
and f0 = f1 holds on D0 ∩ D1. A curve is a continuous map from [0, 1] into
Cd. Given a function element (f0, D0) and a curve γ with γ(0) ∈ D0, if
there is a partition of [0, 1]:

0 = s0 < s1 < ··· < sn = 1
and function elements (fj, Dj)(0 ≤ j ≤ n) such that

1. (fj, Dj) and (fj+1, Dj+1) are direct continuation for all j with

0 ≤ j ≤ n − 1;

2. γ[sj, sj+1] ⊆ Dj(0 ≤ j ≤ n − 1) and γ(1) ∈ Dn,

then (fn, Dn) is called an analytic continuation of (f0, D0) along γ ; and
(f0, D0) is called to admit an analytic continuation along γ. In this case,
we write f0 ∼ fn. Clearly, ∼ deﬁnes an equivalence and we write [f ] for the
equivalent class of f .
Also we need a result from operator algebra. It determines the structure

of ﬁnite dimensional von Neumann algebras [Da, Theorem III.1.2].
Theorem 2.5. Assume that A is a ﬁnite dimensional von Neuamm algebra
on a Hilbert space H. Then A is ∗-isomorphic to Lr

k=1 Mnk (C).

Local solution

This section gives the deﬁnition and some properties of local solution. Also,
we include some results from [HZ] on von Neumann algebras V ∗(Φ, Ω), where
Φ : Ω → Cd is holomorphic.
As follows, we will give a generalization of local inverse. For convenience,
ﬁrst assume both Φ and Ψ are holomorphic maps from Ω to Cd. Write

and similarly,

SΦ,Ψ = {(z, w) ∈ Ω : Ψ(w) = Φ(z), z 6∈ Φ−1 ◦ Ψ(cid:16)Z(JΨ)(cid:17)}.
SΨ,Φ = {(z, w) ∈ Ω : Φ(w) = Ψ(z), z 6∈ Ψ−1 ◦ Φ(cid:16)Z(JΦ)(cid:17)}.

It can happen that SΦ,Ψ or SΨ,Φ is empty, but they make good sense in
cases we are interested. If there is a subdomain ∆ of Ω and a holomorphic
function ρ over ∆ such that

Ψ(ρ(z)) = Φ(z), z ∈ ∆,

then ρ is called a local solution for SΦ,Ψ, denoted by

ρ ∈ Ψ−1 ◦ Φ.

In particular, if Φ = Ψ, then ρ is a local inverse of Φ [T1] and we rewrite
SΦ for SΦ,Φ. Following [HZ], a local solution ρ for SΦ,Ψ is called admissible
if for each curve γ in Ω − Φ−1 ◦ Ψ(cid:16)Z(JΨ)(cid:17), ρ admits analytic continua-
Φ−1◦ Ψ(cid:16)Z(JΨ)(cid:17). As done in [HZ], one can show that Ω− Φ−1◦ Ψ(cid:16)Z(JΨ)(cid:17)

tion with values in Ω. In this case, we say ρ is admissible with respect to

is connected if both Φ and Ψ are holomorphic on Ω.

Remark 3.1. If both Φ and Ψ are holomorphic proper maps, then in the def-
initions of SΦ,Ψ, SΨ,Φ and admissible local solution, we must replace Z(JΦ)
and Z(JΨ) with Z(JΦ) and Z(JΨ), respectively. In this case,

Ω − Φ−1 ◦ Ψ(cid:16)Z(JΨ)(cid:17)

is connected.

It is worthy to mention that if proper maps Φ and Ψ are meanwhile

holomorphic on Ω, then

Ψ−1 ◦ Φ(cid:16)Z(JΦ)(cid:17) = Ψ−1 ◦ Φ(cid:16)Z(JΦ)(cid:17),

7

and

Φ−1 ◦ Ψ(cid:16)Z(JΨ)(cid:17) = Φ−1 ◦ Ψ(cid:16)Z(JΨ)(cid:17).

Given an admissible local inverse ρ of Φ, deﬁne

E[ρ]h(z) = Xσ∈[ρ]

h ◦ σ(z)J σ(z), h ∈ L2

a(Ω), z ∈ Ω − A.

Under mild conditions of Φ, E[ρ] turns out to be a bounded operator on
L2
It is shown in [HZ] that for a holomorphic proper map Φ on Ω,
a(Ω).
V ∗(Φ, Ω) is nontrivial if and only if Φ is not biholomorphic. Observe that
SΦ is a complex manifold. One has the following [HZ, Theorem 1.5].
Theorem 3.2. Suppose Φ is a holomorphic proper map on Ω. Then V ∗(Φ, Ω)
is generated by E[ρ], where ρ are local inverses of Φ. In particular, the dimen-
sion of V ∗(Φ, Ω) equals the number of components of SΦ, and it also equals
the number of equivalent classes of local inverses of Φ.

For a holomorphic map Φ : Ω → Cd, the deck transformation group
G(Φ) of Φ consists of all automorphisms ρ of Ω satisfying Φ ◦ ρ = Φ. The
following is shown in [HZ].
Theorem 3.3. Suppose Φ : Ω → Cd is holomorphic on Ω and the image
of Φ contains an interior point. Then dimV ∗(Φ, Ω) < ∞, and V ∗(Φ, Ω)
is generated by E[ρ], where ρ run over admissible local inverses of Φ. If in
addition, all such ρ are holomorphic in Ω, then V ∗(Φ, Ω) is ∗-isomorphic to
the group von Neumann algebra L(G(Φ)).
In the case of Ω = D, Theorem 3.3 follows directly from a combination of
[DSZ, Theorem 7.6] and the theorem in [T1].

Below we will present some properties of local solutions. To begin with,
when we mention the maps Φ and Ψ, it is assumed that they satisfy the
assumption of Theorems 3.2 or 3.3. In this case, SΦ,Ψ is a nonempty open
set. For two local solutions ρ and σ for SΦ,Ψ, if ρ is an analytic contin-
uation of σ, then their images lie in a same component of SΦ,Ψ, and vice
versa. Therefore, the number of diﬀerent classes of local solutions equals
the number of components of SΦ,Ψ.
simplicity, we redeﬁne

Now assume that both Φ and Ψ are holomorphic proper maps on Ω. For

SΦ,Ψ =n(z, w) ∈ Ω : Ψ(w) = Φ(z), z 6∈ Φ−1◦Ψ(cid:16)Z(JΨ)(cid:17), z 6∈ Ψ−1◦Φ(cid:16)Z(JΦ)(cid:17)o.

8

That is,

where

SΦ,Ψ =n(z, w) ∈ Ω : Ψ(w) = Φ(z)} − ΓΦ,Ψ,

(3.1)

ΓΦ,Ψ = {(z, w) ∈ Ω : Ψ(w) = Φ(z), z ∈ Φ−1◦Ψ(cid:16)Z(JΨ)(cid:17)[ Ψ−1◦Φ(cid:16)Z(JΦ)(cid:17)o.
Note that the numbers of components of both SΦ,Ψ and SΨ,Φ remains in-
variant after we remove only a special set of complex codimension 1 away
from them. This can be seen as follows. By [Ru2, Theorem 14.4.9], a zero
variety of a domain in Cd can be represented as a union of compact sets Ln
whose Hausdorﬀ measures h2d−2(Ln) < ∞, and so is a union of countably
many zero varieties. By [Ru2, Theorem 14.4.5], given a connected domain
U in R2d, if a relatively closed set G can be written as the union of count-
ably many compact sets Kn whose Hausdorﬀ measure ht(Kn) < ∞ for some
t ∈ (0, 2d− 1), then U − G is connected. Since Ψ−1 ◦ Φ(cid:16)Z(JΦ)(cid:17) is relatively
zero varieties as well as Φ(cid:16)Z(JΦ)(cid:17),

closed and by Theorem 2.3 it can be presented as a union of countably many

O − Ψ−1 ◦ Φ(cid:16)Z(JΦ)(cid:17)

is connected for any subdomain O of Ω. Note that SΦ,Ψ consists of disjoint
connected components. Since the newly-deﬁned SΦ,Ψ (see (3.1)) is exactly
the original one minus Ψ−1 ◦ Φ(cid:16)Z(JΦ)(cid:17), they have the same number of
components, and so is SΨ,Φ.
Note that SΦ,Ψ and SΨ,Φ are equal now up to a permutation of coordi-
nates, and they have the same number of components. Thus the numbers of
equivalent classes of local solutions for SΦ,Ψ and SΨ,Φ are exactly equal. Let
n(Φ, Ψ) denote the number of components of SΦ,Ψ. By similar discussion,
we get the following.

Proposition 3.4. Suppose one of the following hold:

(i) both Φ and Ψ are holomorphic proper maps on Ω.

(ii) both Φ and Ψ are holomorphic over Ω and their images in Cd have

nonempty interior.

Then SΦ,Ψ and SΨ,Φ have the same number of components, and there are
n(Φ, Ψ) equivalent classes of local solutions for SΦ,Ψ (or SΨ,Φ).

9

In the sequel, for holomorphic proper maps Φ and Ψ on Ω we use (3.1)
as the deﬁnition of SΦ,Ψ for simplicity. Besides, we have the following result
for local solutions. For the special case of Φ = Ψ, it is shown by the proof
of [HZ, Theorem 1.4].

Proposition 3.5. Suppose that Φ and Ψ are holomorphic proper maps on
Ω with same images. Then each local solution ρ for SΦ,Ψ is admissible in Ω.
Proof. Suppose that Φ and Ψ are holomorphic proper maps on Ω with the
same images. Write

A = Φ−1 ◦ Ψ(cid:16)Z(JΨ)(cid:17).
Since Ψ are proper, by Theorem 2.2 Ψ(cid:16)Z(JΨ)(cid:17) is a zero variety. Then
Ψ(cid:16)Z(JΨ)(cid:17) is relatively closed in Ω, and so is A.
Now for each curve γ in Ω − A, write z0 = γ(0). Given a local solution
ρ with Ψ(ρ(z0)) = Φ(z0), we will prove that ρ admits analytic continuation
along γ. To see this, note that Φ and Ψ has same images. Since γ ⊆ Ω − A,

Φ(γ) ∩ Ψ(cid:16)Z(JΨ)(cid:17) = ∅.

For each point w on γ, Φ(w) lies in the image of Φ. By Theorem 2.2, there
is a constant interger n depending only on Ψ so that Ψ−1(Φ(w)) has exactly
n distinct points. Furthermore, there is an open ball Uw centered at w and
n holomorphic maps ρw

n over Uw satisfying

1 ,··· , ρw
j (z)) = Φ(z), z ∈ Uw, 1 ≤ j ≤ n.

Ψ(ρw

Since γ is compact, by Henie-Borel’s theorem there are ﬁnitely many such
balls Uw whose union covers γ. Then it is straightforward to show that
all ρz0
(1 ≤ j ≤ n) admit analytic continuation along γ. Since one of ρz0
j
(1 ≤ j ≤ n) is the direct continuation of ρ, ρ admits analytic continuation
along γ. The proof is complete.

j

With the assumption of Proposition 3.5, the closure of the range of an
admissible local solution and all its continuations equals that of Ω. To be
precise, let σ be an admissible local solution for SΦ,Ψ and [σ] denotes the
equivalent class of σ, Range [σ] denotes the union of all images of local
solutions in the equivalent class of σ. By deﬁnition we have

Range [σ] ⊆ Ω.

10

Then the inverse σ− of σ is a local solution of SΨ,Φ. By Proposition 3.5,
both σ and σ− are admissible with respect to a common set E, deﬁned by

E = Φ−1 ◦ Ψ(cid:16)Z(JΨ)(cid:17)[ Ψ−1 ◦ Φ(cid:16)Z(JΦ)(cid:17).

Also, we address that Ω − E is connected. Since σ− or its continuation is
well deﬁned on a given point of Ω − E, the union of the images of σ and all
its continuation contains Ω − E. That is,

forcing

Ω − E ⊆ Range [σ],

Ω − E ⊆ Range [σ] ⊆ Ω,

where E is relatively closed subset of Ω with zero Lebesgue measure.
In
conclusion, if both Φ and Ψ are holomorphic proper maps on Ω, then for
each (admissible) local solution σ for SΦ,Ψ

Range [σ] = Ω.

(3.2)

In particular, (3.2) holds if σ is a (necessarily admissible) local inverse of a
holomorphic proper map Φ over Ω.

Remark 3.6. If Φ is holomorphic over Ω and σ is an admissible local
inverse of Φ, then (3.2) still holds. In fact, this can be deduced by similar
reasoning as above and the fact that the family of admissible local inverses
of Φ is closed under composition [T1].

4 Monomials

In this section, we present some maps given by simple polynomials, say
monomials, and most of them induces proper maps. Also, the proof of
Theorem 1.1 is given.

We ﬁrst give the proof of Theorem 1.1.

Proof of Theorem 1.1. First assume det A 6= 0. Then JΦ 6≡ 0 and the
image of ΦA contains an interior point. By Theorem 3.3

dimV ∗(ΦA, Dd) < ∞.

Conversely, assume det A = 0, and we will prove that dimV ∗(ΦA, Dd) = ∞.
Write

eT
j = (0,··· , 1, 0,··· ), 1 ≤ j ≤ d,

11

with 1 lying on the j-th coordinate. Consider the following n + 1 vectors in
Zd
+:

eT = (1, 1,··· , 1), fT

j = eT

j + eT , 1 ≤ j ≤ d.

Since det A = 0,

Zα1 + ··· + Zαd 6= Zd.

Not all the above n + 1 vectors lie in Zα1 + ··· + Zαd. Without loss of
generality, we may assume that for l = 1, 2,··· , leT 6∈ Zα1 + ··· + Zαd. For
each positive integer k, set

Mk = {z

eβ : eβ = keT + β ∈ Zd

+, β ∈ Zα1 + ··· + Zαd}.

Then each Mk is a reducing subspace for TΦA, and the orthogonal projection
Pk onto Mk lies in V ∗(ΦA, Dd). It’s easy to see Pk are distinct since for
l = 1, 2,··· ,

leT 6∈ Zα1 + ··· + Zαd.

Since these Pk are mutually orthogonal, it is clear that dimV ∗(ΦA, Dd) = ∞.
It remains to prove the latter part. To see the “if” part, assume det A = 1
without loss of generality. Since A is a unimodular matrix, its elementary
row transformation involves two classes [Ma, Theorem 22.5]:

(i) row switching;

(ii) multiplying all entries of a row by an integer constant and then adding

to another.

Note that all involved elementary matrices are of determinant 1 or −1.
After ﬁnitely many times of elementary row transformations, A becomes an
upper-triangular matrix eA with integer entries:

Since either det eA = det A or det eA = − det A, we have

Since each pj(1 ≤ j ≤ d) is an integer,

pj = ±1, 1 ≤ j ≤ d.

Then by ﬁnitely many elementary row transformations as above, A becomes
a diagonal matrix whose diagonal entries are 1 or −1. Immediately, for each
integer j(1 ≤ j ≤ d), there are integers {nk

[Zα1 + ··· + Zαd] ∩ Zd

M = span{zβ : β ∈ [Zα1 + ··· + Zαd] ∩ Zd

In conclusion,
V ∗(ΦA, Dd) is trivial if and only if det A 6= ±1.
(cid:3)

a(Dd). This implies that V ∗(ΦA, Dd) is nontrivial.

In Theorem 1.1, we assume det A 6= 0. Under this assumption we will see
that V ∗(Φ, Dd) is abelian. In fact, since A is a matrix with integer entries,
all of its raw transformations involves non-singular matrices with rational
entries. Via raw transformations, A can become a diagonal matrix with
integer diagonal entries. With this observation, letting Φ(w) = Φ(z), one
can ﬁnd positive integers jk(1 ≤ k ≤ d) satisfying
k , 1 ≤ k ≤ d.

k = zjk
wjk

Thus, all local inverses ρ must have the form:

ρ(z1,··· , zd) = (ε1z1,··· , εdzd),
where εj1
d = 1. Clearly, all admissible local inverses commute
with each other under composition. Then by Theorem 3.3, V ∗(ΦA, Dd) is
abelian. In addition, by Lemma 2.4 ΦA is a holomorphic proper map. So
we get the following corollary of Theorem 1.1.

1 = ··· = εjd

Corollary 4.1. Suppose ΦA and A are deﬁned as above Theorem 1.1. Then
ΦA is a holomorphic proper map if and only if det A 6= 0. In this case,
V ∗(ΦA, Dd) is abelian.

14

In Theorem 1.1, we proved that dimV ∗(Φ, Dd) < ∞ if and only if det A 6=
0. In this case, V ∗(Φ, Dd) is abelian. However, if det A = 0, things will be
diﬀerent. Suppose det A = 0. If the dimension d = 2, then V ∗(ΦA, D2) is
non-abelian. In fact, since det A 6= 0, there are integers k0, and l0 such that
both α1 and α2 are integer multiples of (k0, l0). Then

It is known that V ∗(zk0
is not abelian.

V ∗(Φ, D2) ⊇ V ∗(zk0
2 , D2) is not abelian [LZ, SL]. Therefore, V ∗(Φ, D2)

2 , D2).

The following is a generalization of Theorem 1.1.

Example 4.2. In Theorem 1.1, replace z1,··· , zd with B1(z1),··· , Bd(zd),
where Bj(1 ≤ j ≤ d) are d ﬁnite Blaschke products. Write

F (z) = (B1(z1),··· , Bd(zd)),

and consider the map ΨA = (F (z)α1
) on Dd. Assume det A =
±1. Note that the structure of V ∗(ΨA, Dd) rests on the study of admissible
local inverses of ΨA. Using the techniques in the proof of Theorem 1.1, one
can show that for z, w ∈ Dd,

,··· , F (z)αd

ΨA(w) = ΨA(z)

if and only if F (w) = F (z); if and only if Bj(wj) = Bj(zj), 1 ≤ j ≤ d.
Therefore, Ψ(w) = Ψ(z) if and only if

wj = σj(zj),

where σj is a local inverse of Bj(1 ≤ j ≤ d). Since each σj must be an ad-
missible local inverse of Bj on D, (σ1(z1),··· , σd(zd)) deﬁnes an admissible
local inverse of ΨA on Dd. By Theorem 3.3, each operator S in V ∗(ΨA, Dd)
is the linear span of the following:
h 7→ Xρj ∈[σj],1≤j≤d(cid:16)h(ρ1(z1),··· , ρd(zd)) Y1≤j≤d
where each σj is a local inverse of Bj(1 ≤ j ≤ d). Then it is easy to check
that V ∗(ΨA, Dd) is ∗-isomorphic to

j(zj)(cid:17), h ∈ L2

a(Dd),

(4.3)

ρ′

V ∗(B1, D) ⊗ V ∗(B2, D)··· ⊗ V ∗(Bd, D).

By [DPW, Theorem 1.1], for each Blaschke product B V ∗(B, D) is abelian
and hence V ∗(Bk, D)(1 ≤ k ≤ n) are abelian. Therefore, V ∗(ΨA, Dd) is
abelian if A is a unimodular matrix.

15

In Example 4.2,

if the assumption det A = ±1 is replaced with
det A 6= 0, then V ∗(ΨA, Dd) is still abelian. To this this, by the para-
graph above Example 4.2 if ΨA(w) = ΨA(z), then there are positive inte-
gers jk(1 ≤ k ≤ d) such that Bjk
j (zj), 1 ≤ j ≤ d. Replacing
Bj with Bjk
j , each operator in V ∗(ΨA, Dd) can be presented as ﬁnite linear
span of (4.3). Then one can check that V ∗(ΨA, Dd) is abelian. Furthermore,
V ∗(ΨA, Dd) is a ∗-subalgebra of

j (wj) = Bjk

V ∗(Bn1

1 , D) ⊗ V ∗(Bn2

2 , D)··· ⊗ V ∗(Bnd

d , D).

The following example is inspired by elementary symmetric polynomials.

Example 4.3. Suppose Ω is a domain in Cd. Recall that the complete
homogeneous symmetric polynomial hk of degree k in d variables z1,··· , zd,
is the sum of all monomials of total degree k in the variables. Precisely,

zj1 ··· zjk .

hk(z) = X1≤j1≤j2≤···≤jk≤d
ΦI(z) = (z1 + ··· + zd,Xj<k
zj zk,··· , Πd
dXj=1

ΦII(z) = (z1 + ··· + zd,

z2
j ,··· , Πd

j=1zj),

j=1zd

j ),

Write

and

ΦIII(z) = (h1(z), h2(z),··· , hd(z)).

Note that both ΦI and ΦII contain elementary symmetric polynomials. There
are a polynomial p and q such that

ΦI = p ◦ ΦII

and ΦII = q ◦ ΦI .

Thus, MΦI and MΦII have the same adjoint reducing subspaces, and then

V ∗(ΦI , Ω) = V ∗(ΦII , Ω).

Since every symmetric polynomial can be expressed as a polynomial expres-
sion in h1,··· , hd, by same reasoning we also get
V ∗(ΦI , Ω) = V ∗(ΦIII, Ω).

16

Furthermore, if Ω is invariant under Sd, the permutation group, then by
the comments below [HZ, Proposition 6.6] we have V ∗(ΦI , Ω) ∼= L(Sd). For
example, let Ω = Dd or Bd. In particular, we have

V ∗(z1 + z2, z1z2, D2) = V ∗(z1 + z2, z2

1 + z2

2 , D2) ∼= L(S2).

Note that ΦI, ΦII and ΦIII are holomorphic proper maps on Ω if Ω is
invariant under Sd. To see this, note that ΦI (w) = ΦI (z) if and only if
ΦII (w) = ΦII (z); if and only if ΦIII(w) = ΦIII(z). By [HZ, Proposition
6.6] these hold if and only if there is a permutation ρ satisfying

w = ρ(z).

Since Ω is invariant under Sd, ρ is in Aut(Ω). That is, all local inverses of
ΦI are in Aut(Ω). By Lemma 2.4 ΦI is a proper map on Ω, as well as ΦII.

It is natural that if we replace symmetric polynomials with elementary
ones in Example 4.3, we can have more members of admissible local inverses.
The following provides such an example.

Example 4.4. Let k be a positive integer and write

Φ(z) = (zk

1 + zk

2 , z1z2), (z1, z2) ∈ D2.

To study V ∗(Φ, D2), we will determine all local inverses of Φ. For this, write
Φ(w) = Φ(z). Then

(wk

1 + wk

2 , wk

1 wk

2 ) = (zk

1 + zk

2 , zk

1 zk

2 ).

Thus (wk
multiplicity, where

1 , wk

2 ) and (zk

1 , zk

2 ) are the same zeros of a polynomial p counting

p(x) = x2 + (wk

1 + wk

2 )x + wk

1 wk
2 .

Since (wk
1 , zk
inverses are exactly of the following forms:

2 ) is a permutation of (zk

1 , wk

2 ), it is easy to check that all local

or

ρ(z) = (εz1, εz2).

ρ(z) = (εz2, εz1),

(4.4)

(4.5)

where εk = 1. By Lemma 2.4 Φ is a holomorphic proper maps on D2.
Applying Theorem 3.3 shows that the von Neumann algebra V ∗(Φ, D2) is

17

isomorphic to the group von Neumann algebra L(G(Φ)), where G(Φ) consists
of members (4.4) and (4.5).
It is easy to check that G(Φ) is not abelian only if k ≥ 3. Therefore,
V ∗(Φ, D2) is abelian if and only if k = 1, 2. By Theorem 3.3, V ∗(Φ, D2) is
∗-isomorphic to L(G(Φ)).

In Example 4.4 it is easy to check that for k = 3, G(Φ) is not abelian
and ♯G(Φ) = 6. Since S3 is the minimal non-abelian group, and thus in this
case G(Φ) is isomorphic to S3.

5 Twisted Proper maps

This section mainly focus on two twisted holomorphic proper maps and one
will see how their related local solutions give rise to local inverses of the
twisted map. The proof of Theorem 1.2 is presented.

We need a lemma. Let Θ be one of the map ΦI , ΦII and ΦIII deﬁned

in Example 4.3.

Lemma 5.1. Suppose H is a holomorphic function over Ω and the image
of H contains an interior point. Then dimV ∗(Θ ◦ H, Ω) < ∞. As Θ varies,
these three von Neumann algebras are equal.

Proof. Let Θ be one of the map ΦI, ΦII ΦIII deﬁned in Example 4.3.

Assume that H is a holomorphic function over Ω and the image of H
contains an interior point. Then Θ ◦ H is a holomorphic function over Ω.
Besides, by Example 4.3 Θ is a holomorphic proper map on Cd, and hence
by Theorem 2.1 Θ is open. Since the image of H contains an interior point,
so does Θ ◦ H. Therefore, by Theorem 3.3 the conclusion in Lemma 5.1
holds.

By the above proof, if H satisﬁes the assumption in Lemma 5.1, then
V ∗(Θ ◦ H, Ω) equals the linear span of E[ρ] where ρ are admissible local
inverses of Θ ◦ H. In particular, if H is a holomorphic proper map over Ω
and H is holomorphic on Ω, then Lemma 5.1 holds.
Below, we give a general setting. Let f1,··· , fd be d holomorphic func-

tions over a domain on Cd. Deﬁne

where

F (z) = (ϕ1(z),··· , ϕd(z)),
dXj=1
fj(z), ϕ2(z) = X1≤j<k≤d

fj(z)fk(z),

ϕ1(z) =

(5.1)

18

··· and ϕd(z) =Q1≤j≤d fj(z). Note that F is the composition of (f1(z),··· , fd(z))

and ΦI . Consider the equation

F (w) = F (z);

that is,

Note that

(ϕ1(w),··· , ϕd(w)) = (ϕ1(z),··· , ϕd(z)).

xd − ϕ1(z)xd−1 + ··· + (−1)d−1ϕd−1(z)x + (−1)dϕd(z) =

dYj=1
(x − fj(z)),

and then (f1(w),··· , fd(w)) is a permutation of (f1(z),··· , fd(z)). Thus
solving the equation F (w) = F (z) is equivalent to solving all equations:

fj(w) = fπ(j)(z), 1 ≤ j ≤ d,

(5.2)

where π runs over all permutations of {1,··· , d}.
A special case of (5.2) will be discussed as follows. For simplicity, let
Ω be a bounded domain in C2. Let Φ = (φ1, φ2) and Ψ = (ψ1, ψ2) be
holomorphic proper maps over Ω satisfying

and both of them are holomorphic on Ω Write

Φ(Ω) = Ψ(Ω),

f1(z) = φ1(z1, z2), f2(z) = φ2(z1, z2),

and

f3(z) = ψ1(z3, z4), f4(z) = ψ2(z3, z4).

In this case, rewrite FΦ,Ψ for the map F deﬁned by (5.1). That is,

FΦ,Ψ = ΦI ◦ (Φ, Ψ).

To investigate the structure of V ∗(FΦ,Ψ, Ω2), we must determine all admissi-
ble local inverses for FΦ,Ψ on Ω2. Among them, two admissible local inverses
are related with SΦ, SΨ, and SΦ,Ψ. Precisely, consider two equations

(Φ(w1, w2), Ψ(w3, w4)) = (Φ(z1, z2), Ψ(z3, z4)),

and

(Φ(w1, w2), Ψ(w3, w4)) = (Ψ(z3, z4), Φ(z1, z2)).

19

We get these solutions:

and

(σ1(z1, z2), σ2(z3, z4)), σ1 ∈ Φ−1 ◦ Φ, σ2 ∈ Ψ−1 ◦ Ψ,

(η1(z3, z4), η2(z1, z2)), η1 ∈ Φ−1 ◦ Ψ, η2 ∈ Ψ−1 ◦ Φ.

(5.3)

(5.4)

By Proposition 3.5, both (5.3) and (5.4) give admissible local inverses of
FΦ,Ψ. It is possible that there exists admissible local inverse diﬀerent from
(5.3) or (5.4), see the following.

Example 5.2. Let Ω = D2, put Φ(z1, z2) = (B1(z1), B2(z2)) and

Ψ(z1, z2) = (B3(z1), B4(z2)),

where B1,··· , B4 are ﬁnite Blaschke products. In this case, one can have
more admissible local inverses of FΦ,Ψ. In fact, for a permutation π of
{1,··· , 4} (5.2) gives

Bj(wj) = Bπ(j)(zπ(j)),

and this gives admissible local inverses

(ρ1(zπ(1)),··· , ρ4(zπ(4))), ρj ∈ B−1

j ◦ Bπ(j), 1 ≤ j ≤ 4.
Thus FΦ,Ψ possesses a lot of admissible local inverses as π varies.

In some cases, (5.3) and (5.4) exhaust all admissible local inverse of FΦ,Ψ
on Ω2. Let (g1, g2, g3, g4) be a permutation of (f1, f2, f3, f4). By (5.2), we
get

(f1(w), f2(w), f3(w), f4(w)) = (g1(z), g2(z), g3(z), g4(z)).

Letting ρ be a local inverse of FΦ,Ψ gives

(f1(ρ(z)), f2(ρ(z)), f3(ρ(z)), f4(ρ(z))) = (g1(z), g2(z), g3(z), g4(z)), z ∈ Ω−E,
where E is a subset of Ω with zero Lebesgue measure. In particular, by (3.2)
we get
(5.5)

(f1, f2, f3, f4)(Ω2) = (g1, g2, g3, g4)(Ω2).

If (5.5) holds, then we call the equation

(f1(w), f2(w), f3(w), f4(w)) = (g1(z), g2(z), g3(z), g4(z))

compatible. If the only possible compatible equations are

(Φ(w1, w2), Ψ(w3, w4)) = (Φ(z1, z2), Ψ(z3, z4)),

20

and

(Φ(w1, w2), Ψ(w3, w4)) = (Ψ(z3, z4), Φ(z1, z2)),

then we call FΦ,Ψ has no nontrivial compatible equations. By Lemma 5.1 we
get the following.

Theorem 5.3. Suppose Φ and Ψ are two holomorphic proper maps over Ω
such that Φ(Ω) = Ψ(Ω), and both maps are holomorphic on Ω. Assume that
FΦ,Ψ has no nontrivial compatible equation. Then V ∗(FΦ,Ψ, Ω2) is generated
by E[ρ], where ρ is of the form (5.3) or (5.4).
In particular, under the assumption of Theorem 5.3 V ∗(FΦ,Ψ, Ω2) is trivial
if and only if Φ = Ψ and Φ is biholomorphic.
The following provides an example of FΦ,Ψ with no nontrivial compatible

equation.

Example 5.4. Write Ω = D2, and deﬁne

Φ(z1, z2) = (z2

1 + z3

2 , z2

1 z3

2), (z1, z2) ∈ Ω,

and

Ψ(z1, z2) = (z1 + z2, z1z2), (z1, z2) ∈ Ω.

Clearly, we have Φ(Ω) = Ψ(Ω).

First, we state that there is no nontrivial compatable equations for FΦ,Ψ.

For this, consider

Deﬁne π1(z) = z1, π2,3(z) = (z2, z3), z ∈ C4 and etc. From (5.5) we have

π1(f1, f2, f3, f4)(Ω2) = π1(g1, g2, g3, g4)(Ω2),

π1,2(f1, f2, f3, f4)(Ω2) = π1,2(g1, g2, g3, g4)(Ω2),

(5.6)

and etc. By (5.6) we would have

{(w1 + w2, w1w2) : w1, w2 ∈ D} = 2D × D,

but this is impossible. Similarly, one can show that any equations of the
form

can not be compatible. The remaining cases can be handled in a same way.
Thus, there is no nontrivial compatable equations for FΦ,Ψ.

As follows, we will determine all admissible local inverses of FΦ,Ψ. For

this, it suﬃces to consider compatible equations. First consider

The corresponding local inverse is

(ρ(z1, z2), σ(z3, z4)),

where ρ has the form

(qz3

2 , 3qz2

1)

or

(c1z1, c2z2), with c2

1 = c3

2 = 1,

and

σ(z3, z4) = (z3, z4)

or σ(z3, z4) = (z4, z3).

It remains to deal with the equations

By solving them, we get the local inverses

and

(√z3, 3√z4, z2

2 ), (√z3, 3√z4, z3

1 , z3

2 , z2
1 )

( 3√z4,√z3, z2

2), ( 3√z4,√z3, z3

1 , z3

2 , z2

1).

All the above local inverses are admissible. This shows that V ∗(FΦ,Ψ, Ω2)
can have rich structures.

We are ready to give the proof of Theorem 1.2.

Proof of Theorem 1.2. Suppose Φ and Ψ are two holomorphic proper
maps over Ω and both maps are holomorphic on Ω. We must determine all
admissible local inverses of FΦ,Ψ. Since FΦ,Ψ has no nontrivial compatible
equation., it suﬃces to consider two cases of (5.2):

(Φ(w1, w2), Ψ(w3, w4)) = (Φ(z1, z2), Ψ(z3, z4))

(5.7)

22

and

(Φ(w1, w2), Ψ(w3, w4)) = (Ψ(z3, z4), Φ(z1, z2))

(5.8)

Note that both sides of (5.8) deﬁne holomorphic proper maps on Ω2. If there
were an admissible local solution for (5.8), then by (3.2)

Φ(Ω) × Ψ(Ω) = Ψ(Ω) × Φ(Ω),

forcing Ψ(Ω) = Ψ(Ω). This is a contradiction. Therefore, there is no admis-
sible local solution for (5.8).

It remains to deal with (5.7). It is clear that each admissible local so-
lution η of (5.7) is exactly of the form (ρ(z1, z2), σ(z3, z4)), where ρ and σ
are admissible local inverses of Φ and Ψ in Ω, respectively. Since Φ is a
holomorphic proper maps over Ω, all of its local inverses are admissible.
Theorem 3.2 shows that V ∗(Φ, Ω) is generated by Eρ, where ρ run over all
admissible local inverses of Φ. Similar result holds for V ∗(Ψ, Ω). Then by
setting

E[ρ(z1,z2),σ(z3,z4)] 7→ E[ρ] ⊗ E[σ],

we obtain a ∗-isomorphism between V ∗(FΦ,Ψ, Ω2) and V ∗(Φ, Ω) ⊗ V ∗(Ψ, Ω),
ﬁnishing the proof of Theorem 1.2.

(cid:3)

Both Theorems 5.3 and 1.2 have natural generalizations to the case of
Ω being a bounded domain in Cd. The proofs are just the same. Also, one
can deﬁne a map F (like FΦ,Ψ) based on three or more holomorphic proper
maps on Ω, and there will be no essential diﬀerence from Theorems 5.3 and
1.2.

For d = 1, the following is of independent interest.

Proposition 5.5. Suppose f and g are holomorphic over D. Write
Φf,g = (f (z1) + g(z2), f (z1)g(z2)). If f (D) 6= g(D), then V ∗(Φf,g, D2) is
∗-isomorphic to V ∗(f, D) ⊗ V ∗(g, D). Therefore, V ∗(Φ, D2) is abelian.
Proof. Following the proof of Theorem 1.2, one can obtain a ∗-isomorphism
between V ∗(Φf,g, D2) and V ∗(f, D) ⊗ V ∗(g, D). The only diﬀerence here is
Theorem 3.2 is replaced by Theorem 3.3, which implies that if h is holomor-
phic over D, then V ∗(h, D) is generated by Eρ, where ρ run over all admissible
local inverses of h.
Since f is holomorphic over D, by Thomson’s theorem [T1] there is a

ﬁnite Blaschke product Bf such that

V ∗(f, D) = V ∗(Bf , D).

23

Recall that for each ﬁnite Blaschke product B, V ∗(B, D) is abelian [DPW,
Theorem 1.1]. Then so is V ∗(f, D), as well as V ∗(g, D). Therefore, V ∗(f, D)⊗
V ∗(g, D) is adbelian, and hence V ∗(Φf,g, D2) is abelian.

If the condition f (D) 6= g(D) is dropped, then V ∗(Φf,g, D2) is not neces-
sarily abelian, and thus V ∗(Φf,g, D2) may not be ∗-isomorphic to
V ∗(f, D) ⊗ V ∗(g, D). This will be illustrated in the next section.

6 Twisted ﬁnite Blaschke products

This section mainly establishes Theorem 1.3 and gives some examples for
it. It will be shown that there is an interplay between operator theory and
geometry.

We ﬁrst provide the proof of Theorem 1.3.

Proof of Theorem 1.3. Let B1 and B2 be ﬁnite Blaschke products and
write

ΦB1,B2(z) = (B1(z1) + B2(z2), B1(z1)B2(z2)), (z1, z2) ∈ D2.

Since ΦB1,B2 is the composition of two holomorphic proper maps (z1 +
z2, z1z2) and (B1(z1), B2(z2)), ΦB1,B2 is a holomorphic proper map on D2.
Below we will show that V ∗(ΦB1,B2 , D2) is abelian if and only if SB1,B2
is connected. To see this, by Theorem 3.2 studying V ∗(ΦB1,B2 , D2) reduces
to studying the admissible local inverses of ΦB1,B2. For this, write

ΦB1,B2(w) = ΦB1,B2(z), w, z ∈ D2.

Then by discussion in Example 4.3 either

(cid:26) B1(w1) = B1(z1),

B2(w2) = B2(z2),

(cid:26) B1(w1) = B2(z2),

B2(w2) = B1(z1).

or

Thus either

(w1, w2) = (ρ(z1), σ(z2)), ρ ∈ B−1

1 ◦ B1, σ ∈ B−1

2 ◦ B2,

or

(w1, w2) = (ζ(z2), η(z1)), ζ ∈ B−1

1 ◦ B2, η ∈ B−1

2 ◦ B1.

24

(6.1)

(6.2)

By Proposition 3.5 all ρ, σ, ζ and η are admissible, and the above local
inverses (6.1) and (6.2) of ΦB1,B2 are also admissible. Observe that in (6.2)
a local solution for SB1,B2 and another for SB2,B1 give rise to a local inverse
of the map ΦB1,B2. Thus, two single-variable local solutions induce a two-
variable local inverse.

To discuss the abelian property of V ∗(ΦB1,B2 , D2), we must study whether
their equivalent class commute with each other under composition. This
heavily relies on whether ([ρ] ◦ [ζ](z2), [σ] ◦ [η](z1)) equals

([ζ] ◦ [σ](z2), [η] ◦ [ρ](z1)).

Before continuing, one must determine what is the composition of two equiv-
alent classes [GH3]. Observe that for any local inverses [τ1] and [τ2], E[τ1]E[τ2]
has the form

Xj

E[σj ],

where the sum is ﬁnite and some σj may lie in the same class. Based on
this, we deﬁne the composition

to be a formal sum Pj[σj]. Thus

[τ1] ◦ [τ2]

E[τ1]E[τ2] = E[τ2]E[τ1]

if and only if [τ1] ◦ [τ2] = [τ2] ◦ [τ1]. The formal sum of k [σ] is denoted by
k[σ].
Since a ﬁnite Blaschke product has no critical point on the unit circle T,
it is conformal on each point on T. Thus for j, k = 1, 2 the local solutions
for SBj ,Bk are analytic on a neighborhood of each point on T. Concerning
these local solutions, we can just discuss their behavior on the unit circle
T. Suppose order B1 = m and order B2 = n. Let a1,··· , am be m distinct
points on T and b1,··· , bn be n distinct points on T, both in anti-clockwise
direction and satisfying

B1(aj) = B2(bk) = 1, 1 ≤ j ≤ m, 1 ≤ k ≤ n.

(6.3)

Suppose SB1,B2 is not connected. That is, SB1,B2 has more than one

component. Let [ζ](a1) denote the set of all eζ(a1) as eζ run over all analytic

continuation along a loop beginning at a1. Writing

[ζ](a1) = {bk : k ∈ Λ},

25

we have

[ζ](a1) 6= {b1,··· , bn}.

Thus there is at least a local solution η of SB1,B2 such that η(a1) 6∈ [ζ](a1).
Write

η(a1) = bj0.

By conformal property of B1 and B2 on T, local solutions for SB1,B2 (or
SB2,B1) admit continuation along any curve contained in T. In particular,
by (6.3) there must be some aj such that ζ −1(bj0) = aj, forcing

ζ(aj) = bj0 .

Let ρ be the identity map, and σ be the local inverse of B1 determined by
σ(a1) = aj. Then

Noting that η(a1) = bj0, we deduce that [ζ] ◦ [σ] must contain [η]. But

bj0 ∈ ζ ◦ σ(a1).

[ρ] ◦ [ζ] = [ζ] 6= [η].

Therefore, [ρ] ◦ [ζ] 6= [ζ] ◦ [σ], forcing

([ρ] ◦ [ζ](z2), [σ] ◦ [η](z1)) 6= ([ζ] ◦ [σ](z2), [η] ◦ [ρ](z1)).

This means that there are two equivalences of admissible local inverses of
ΦB1,B2, (6.1) and (6.2), do not commute. Then by Theorem 3.2 V ∗(ΦB1,B2 , D2)
is not abelian.
Now assume SB1,B2 is connected. That is, SB1,B2 has only one com-
ponent, as well as SB2,B1. In this case, we will prove that V ∗(ΦB1,B2, D2)
is abelian. First, it will be shown that the equivalence of a local inverse
(6.1) commutes with that of (6.2). Assume [ζ] and [η] are the only equiva-
lent classes for local solutions of SB1,B2 and SB2,B1, respectively. By careful
analysis of boundary behaviors of B1 and B2, we get

[ρ] ◦ [ζ] = ♯[ρ] · [ζ] and [σ] ◦ [η] = ♯[σ] · [η].

Thus, letting z1 and z2 be complex variables gives

([ρ] ◦ [ζ](z2), [σ] ◦ [η](z1)) = ♯[ρ] · ♯[σ]([ζ](z2), [η](z1)).

Similarly,

([ζ] ◦ [σ](z2), [η] ◦ [ρ](z1)) = ♯[ρ] · ♯[σ]([ζ](z2), [η](z1)),

26

which gives

([ρ] ◦ [ζ](z2), [σ] ◦ [η](z1)) = ([ζ] ◦ [σ](z2), [η] ◦ [ρ](z1)).

Thus, the equivalence of a local inverse (6.1) commutes with that of (6.2).
Besides, we will see that two equivalences of local inverses with the form
(6.1) commutes. In fact, since B1 is a ﬁnite Blaschke product, by [DPW,
Theorem 1.1] V ∗(B1, D) is abelian. Since V ∗(B1, D) is generated by E[ρ]
where ρ are local inverses of B1, we have

Similarly,

[ρ1] ◦ [ρ2] = [ρ2] ◦ [ρ1], ρ1, ρ2 ∈ B−1

1 ◦ B1.

[σ1] ◦ [σ2] = [σ2] ◦ [σ1], σ1, σ2 ∈ B−1

2 ◦ B2.

Therefore, we have

([ρ1](z1), [σ1](z2))◦([ρ2](z1), [σ2](z2)) = ([ρ2](z1), [σ2](z2))◦([ρ1](z1), [σ1](z2)).
In addition, equivalences of local inverses with the form (6.2) commute be-
cause there is exactly one of such local inverse. In summary, all admissible
local inverses of ΦB1,B2 commute with each other under composition. There-
fore, if SB1,B2 is connected, V ∗(ΦB1,B2, D2) is abelian. The proof is complete.

(cid:3)

By the proof of Theorem 1.3 all local admissible inverses of ΦB1,B2 ex-
actly have either the form (6.1) or (6.2). Then by Theorem 3.3 it follows
that

dimV ∗(ΦB1,B2, D2) = n(B1, B1)n(B2, B2) + n(B1, B2)n(B2, B1)
= dim(cid:0)V ∗(B1, D) ⊗ V ∗(B2, D)(cid:1) + n(B1, B2)2,

where n(Bj, Bk)(j, k = 1, 2) are the numbers of components of S(Bj ,Bk) de-
ﬁned above Proposition 3.4. In particular, V ∗(ΦB1,B2, D2) is not ∗-isomorphic
to the von Neumann algebra V ∗(B1, D) ⊗ V ∗(B2, D).
Besides, it is worthy to re-mention in Theorem 1.3 SB1,B2 is connected if
and only if all local solution for SB1,B2 are equivalent in the sense of analytic
continuation.
If B1 = B2, one
component of SB1,B2 is {(z, z) : z ∈ D − J}, where J is a ﬁnite set. There-
fore, SB1,B1 is connected if and only if order B1=1. This immediately gives
Example 6.5 in [HZ].

Some special cases of Theorem 1.3 are of interest.

In the case of B1 6= B2, things are interesting, see the following.

27

Example 6.1. Write m = orderB1, and n = orderB2. One will see that
if GCD(m, n) = 1, SB1,B2 is also connected. Therefore, by Theorem 1.3
V ∗(ΦB1,B2, D2) is abelian. To see this, note that the proof of Theorem 1.3
has shown that a local solution for SB1,B2 admits continuation along any
curve contained in T. Without loss of generality, m > n. Let aj and bk
be chosen as in the proof of Theorem 1.3. Suppose ζ is a local solution
satisfying

ζ(a1) = b1.

Note that for 1 ≤ j ≤ m − 1 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1, the image of the circular
arc ^aj aj+1 under B1 is the same as that of the circular arc ^bkbk+1 under B2.
Then we get

eζ(aj) = bj, 1 ≤ j ≤ m.

where eζ denotes some analytic continuation along a circular curve γ in T.
Letting γ go a bit further, and noting eζ(am) = bm yield
where bζ is also an analytic continuation of ζ. This procedure can be repeated.
Since GCD(m, n) = 1, one can show that for each k(1 ≤ k ≤ n) there exists
an analytic continuation η of ζ such that

bζ(a1) = bm+1,

η(a1) = bk.

Thus all local solutions for SB1,B2 is an analytic continuation of ζ, and
SB1,B2 has exactly one component. That is, SB1,B2 is connected.

The following is a special case.

Example 6.2. Write B1(t) = tk and B2(t) = tl with t ∈ D and k, l ∈ Z+.
We claim that SB1,B2 is connected if and only if

GCD(k, l) = 1.

Then by Proposition 1.3 V ∗(zk

1 + zl

2, zk

1 zl

2, D2) is abelian if and only if

GCD(k, l) = 1,

1 +zl
if and only if V ∗(zk
from [DH, Theorem 1.1].

2, D2) is abelian. The latter statement follows directly

To ﬁnish the proof, we must show that SB1,B2 is connected if and only if

GCD(k, l) = 1.

28

In fact, by the discussion in the above paragraph, if GCD(k, l) = 1, then
SB1,B2 is connected. Now suppose GCD(k, l) = d0 > 1. Write ωj =
exp( j2πi

k ) and

ςj = exp(

j2πi

l

), j ∈ Z+.

Let η denote local solution for SB1,B2 satisfying η(ω1) = ς1. Note that each
local solution for SB1,B2 admits analytic continuation along any curve in
C − {0}. All continuations of η can be realized by a loop on T. Then it is
not diﬃcult to see that

[η](ω1) = {ς1+md0 : m ∈ Z+}.

Clearly, [η](ω1) 6= {ςj : j ∈ Z+}. Take an integer j0 such that

ςj0 6∈ [η](ω1),

and let ζ denote the local solution for SB1,B2 satisfying ζ(ω1) = ςj0. Then

[η] 6= [ζ].

Thus there are at least two components of SB1,B2, and SB1,B2 is not con-
nected.

Theorem 1.3 fails if more than two Blaschke products are twisted. This

is illustrated by the following.

Example 6.3. Let d ≥ 3. For d Blaschke products B1, B2 ··· , Bd, let Φ(z)
denote
(B1(z1)+B2(z2)+···+Bd(zd),Xj<k
Then V ∗(Φ, Dd) is not abelian.
We will ﬁrst deal with the case of d = 3. The remaining case, as will be
seen, can be handled similarly. Consider solutions for the equation Φ(w) =
Φ(z) :

Bj(zj)Bk(zk),··· , B1(z1)B2(z2)··· Bd(zd)).

Then we have (w1, w2, w3) = (ζ1,2(z2), ζ2,1(z1), ζ3,3(z3)), where

B1(w1) = B2(z2)
B2(w2) = B1(z1)
B3(w3) = B3(z3)




ζj,k ∈ B−1

j ◦ Bk(1 ≤ j, k ≤ 3)

29

are admissible local solutions. Also, write

B1(w1) = B3(z3)
B2(w2) = B2(z2)
B3(w3) = B1(z1)




Then we get another admissible local inverse of Φ:

(ζ1,3(z3), ζ2,2(z2), ζ3,1(z1)).

By taking the compositions of their equivalent classes, we get

([ζ1,2] ◦ [ζ2,2](z2), [ζ2,1] ◦ [ζ1,3](z3), [ζ3,3] ◦ [ζ3,1](z1)),

and

([ζ1,3] ◦ [ζ3,3](z3), [ζ2,2] ◦ [ζ2,1](z1), [ζ3,1] ◦ [ζ1,2](z2)).

Clearly, they can not be equal since the complex variables do not match.
Thus not all equivalent classes of local inverse commute with each other
under composition. Therefore, by Theorem 3.3 V ∗(Φ, Dd) is not abelian.
