HIGHER-ORDER VARIATIONAL PROBLEMS

OF HERGLOTZ TYPE WITH TIME DELAY

SIM ˜AO P. S. SANTOS, NAT ´ALIA MARTINS AND DELFIM F. M. TORRES

Abstract. We study, using an optimal control point of view, higher-
order variational problems of Herglotz type with time delay. Main re-
sults are a higher-order Euler–Lagrange and DuBois–Reymond neces-
sary optimality conditions as well as a higher-order Noether type theo-
rem for delayed variational problems of Herglotz type.

1. Introduction

The generalized variational problem proposed by Herglotz in 1930 [11]
can be formulated as follows: determine the trajectories x ∈ C 1([a, b]; Rm)
and the functional z ∈ C 1([a, b]; R) such that
z(b) −→ extr,

(H 1)

where the pair (x(·), z(·)) satisﬁes

˙z(t) = L(t, x(t), ˙x(t), z(t)),

t ∈ [a, b],

subject to x(a) = α,

z(a) = γ,

for some α ∈ Rm and γ ∈ R, and where the Lagrangian L is assumed to
satisfy the following assumptions:
i. L ∈ C 1([a, b] × R2m+1; R);

ii. the functions t 7→

∂L
∂x

(t, x(t), ˙x(t), z(t)), t 7→

∂L
∂ ˙x

(t, x(t), ˙x(t), z(t))

and t 7→

(t, x(t), ˙x(t), z(t)) are diﬀerentiable for any admissible

∂L
∂z

pair (x(·), z(·)).

Observe that if the Lagrangian L does not depend on the variable z, then
we get the classical problem of the calculus of variations. An advantage
of formulation (H 1) is the ability to provide a variational description of

non-conservative processes, even when the Lagrangian L is autonomous,
something that is not possible with the classical variational problem. For
important applications in thermodynamics see [5].

The variational problem of Herglotz attracted the interest of the math-
ematical community only in 1996, with the publications [8, 9]. Since then,
several authors investigated such variational problems. The following gen-
eralizations of well-known classical results are available: extension of both
Noether symmetry theorems for ﬁrst-order problems [5–7]; Euler–Lagrange
and transversality optimality conditions for higher-order variational prob-
lems of Herglotz type [14]; the ﬁrst Noether theorem for ﬁrst-order problems
of Herglotz with time delay [15]; and the ﬁrst Noether theorem for higher-
order problems of Herglotz type [17]. For an optimal control approach to
ﬁrst-order Herglotz type problems see [16].

Dynamic systems with time delay are very important in modelling real-
life phenomena in several ﬁelds, such as mathematics, biology, chemistry,
economics and mechanics. Indeed, several process outcomes are determined
not only by variables at present time, but also by its behaviour in the past.
Motivated by the importance of problems with time delay, many authors
generalized the classical results of the calculus of variations to the delayed
case. The ﬁrst work in this direction seems to have been published by
`El’sgol’c [3]. For some recent works on optimal control see [1, 2] and refer-
ences therein. The importance of variational problems of Herglotz, as well as
the wide applicability of problems with time delay, allied to the impossibility
of applying the classical Noether theorem to these problems, constitute the
main motivation to the present work.

The main goal of this paper is to generalize the results of [14–17] by con-
sidering higher-order variational problems of Herglotz type with a time delay,
proving the corresponding Euler–Lagrange equations, transversality condi-
tions, the DuBois–Reymond necessary optimality condition and Noether’s
ﬁrst theorem.
In particular, in relation to our previous work with time
delay [15], we improved its results by considering a wider class of admissi-
ble functions. Moreover, we extend the results of [15] to the higher-order
case. Precisely, we generalize Herglotz’s problem (H 1) by considering the
following variational problem with time delay.

τ ). Let τ be a real number such that 0 ≤ τ < b − a. Determine
Problem (Hn
the piecewise trajectories x ∈ P C n([a − τ, b]; Rm) and the functional z ∈
P C 1([a, b]; R) such that:

The structure of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we recall the nec-
essary background: the well-known Pontryagin’s maximum principle, the
DuBois–Reymond necessary optimality condition, and an extension of the
classical Noether’s theorem for optimal control problems. In Section 3 we
formulate and prove our main results:
the higher-order Euler–Lagrange
equations and transversality conditions for generalized variational problems
with time delay (Theorem 3.4); the DuBois–Reymond optimality condition
(Theorem 3.8); and Noether’s theorem for higher-order variational problems
of Herglotz type with time delay (Theorem 3.11). We end with Section 4 of
conclusions and possible future work.

We begin by recalling the problem of optimal control in Bolza form:

2. Preliminaries

(P )

J (x(·), u(·)) =Z b

a

f (t, x(t), u(t))dt + φ(x(b)) −→ extr

subject to ˙x(t) = g(t, x(t), u(t)),

with some initial condition on x, where f ∈ C 1([a, b] × Rm × Ω; R), φ ∈
C 1(Rm; R), g ∈ C 1([a, b] × Rm × Ω; Rm), x ∈ P C 1([a, b]; Rm) and u ∈
P C([a, b]; Ω), with Ω ⊆ Rr an open set. Usually x and u are called the
state and control variables, respectively, while φ is known as the payoﬀ or
salvage term. It is clear that the classical problem of the calculus of varia-
tions is a particular case of problem (P ) with φ(x) ≡ 0, g(t, x, u) = u and
Ω = Rm. Next we present Pontryagin’s maximum principle, one of the main
tools for this paper.

Theorem 2.1 (Pontryagin’s maximum principle for problem (P ) [13]). If a
pair (x(·), u(·)) with x ∈ P C 1([a, b]; Rm) and u ∈ P C([a, b]; Ω) is a solution
to problem (P ) with the initial condition x(a) = α, α ∈ Rm, then there
exists ψ ∈ P C 1([a, b]; Rm) such that the following conditions hold:

• the optimality condition

(2.1)

∂H
∂u

(t, x(t), u(t), ψ(t)) = 0;

4

• the adjoint system

( ˙x(t) = ∂H

˙ψ(t) = − ∂H

∂ψ (t, x(t), u(t), ψ(t))

∂x (t, x(t), u(t), ψ(t));

• the transversality condition

ψ(b) = grad(φ(x))(b);

(2.2)

(2.3)

where the Hamiltonian H is deﬁned by

(2.4)

H(t, x, u, ψ) = f (t, x, u) + ψ · g(t, x, u).

Deﬁnition 2.2 (Pontryagin extremal to (P )). A triplet (x(·), u(·), ψ(·))
with x ∈ P C 1([a, b]; Rm), u ∈ P C([a, b]; Ω) and ψ ∈ P C 1([a, b]; Rm) is
called a Pontryagin extremal to problem (P ) if it satisﬁes the necessary
optimality conditions (2.1)–(2.3).

Now we present the following necessary optimality condition that is used

in the proof of our Theorem 3.8.

Theorem 2.3 (DuBois–Reymond condition of optimal control [13]). If
(x(·), u(·), ψ(·)) is a Pontryagin extremal to problem (P ), then the Hamil-
tonian (2.4) satisﬁes the equality

dH
dt

(t, x(t), u(t), ψ(t)) =

∂H
∂t

(t, x(t), u(t), ψ(t)),

t ∈ [a, b].

Many years before the publication of the celebrated result of Pontryagin et
al. in [13], Emmy Noether proved two remarkable theorems that relate the
invariance of a variational integral with the corresponding Euler–Lagrange
equations. Several extensions of the two Noether theorems were proved in
diﬀerent contexts.
In this paper we are concerned with the ﬁrst Noether
theorem, also known simply by Noether’s theorem. The Noether theorem
[12] is a fundamental tool of the calculus of variations [22], optimal control
[18, 19, 21] and modern theoretical physics [4]. This theorem guarantees
that when an optimal control problem is invariant under a one parameter
family of transformations, then there exists a corresponding conservation
law: an expression that is conserved along all the Pontryagin extremals of
the problem (see [18, 19, 21] and references therein). Here we use Noether’s
theorem as stated in [18], which is formulated for problems of optimal control
in Lagrange form, that is, for problem (P ) with φ ≡ 0. In order to apply
the results of [18] to the Bolza problem (P ), we rewrite it in the following
equivalent Lagrange form:

(2.5)

I(x(·), y(·), u(·)) =Z b

a

[f (t, x(t), u(t)) + y(t)] dt −→ extr,

( ˙x(t) = g (t, x(t), u(t)) ,

˙y(t) = 0,

x(a) = α, y(a) =

φ(x(b))
b − a

.

To present Noether’s theorem for the optimal control problem (P ), we need
to deﬁne the concept of invariance. In this paper we follow the deﬁnition of
invariance found in [18] applied to the equivalent optimal control problem
(2.5). In Deﬁnition 2.4 we use the little-o notation.

Deﬁnition 2.4 (Invariance of problem (P )). Let hs be a one-parameter
family of invertible C 1 maps

hs : [a, b] × Rm × Ω −→ R × Rm × Rr,

hs(t, x, u) = (T s(t, x, u), X s(t, x, u), U s(t, x, u)) ,

h0(t, x, u) = (t, x, u) for all (t, x, u) ∈ [a, b] × Rm × Ω.

Problem (P ) is said to be invariant under transformations hs if for all
(x(·), u(·)) the following two conditions hold:

(cid:20)f ◦ hs(t, x(t), u(t)) +

φ(x(b))
b − a

+ ξs + o(s)(cid:21) dT s

(t, x(t), u(t))

= f (t, x(t), u(t)) +

φ(x(b))

for some constant ξ; and

dX s
dt

(t, x(t), u(t)) = g ◦ hs(t, x(t), u(t))

dT s
dt

(t, x(t), u(t)).

As a direct consequence of Noether’s theorem proved in [18] and Pontrya-
gin’s maximum principle (Theorem 2.1), we get the following result that is
central to prove our Theorem 3.11.

Theorem 2.5 (Noether’s theorem for the optimal control problem (P )). If
problem (P ) is invariant in the sense of Deﬁnition 2.4, then the quantity

(b − t)ξ + ψ(t) · X(t, x(t), u(t))

−(cid:20)H(t, x(t), u(t), ψ(t)) +

φ(x(b))

b − a (cid:21) · T (t, x(t), u(t))

is constant in t along every Pontryagin extremal (x(·), u(·), ψ(·)) of problem
(P ), where H is deﬁned by (2.4) and

T (t, x(t), u(t)) =

X(t, x(t), u(t)) =

3.1. Reduction to a non-delayed problem. We generalize the technique
of reduction of a delayed ﬁrst-order optimal control problem to a non-delayed
problem proposed by Guinn in [10] to our higher-order delayed problem. In
order to reduce the higher-order problem of Herglotz with time delay to a
non-delayed ﬁrst-order problem, we assume, without loss of generality, the
initial time to be zero (a = 0) and the ﬁnal time to be an integer multiple of
τ , that is, b = N τ for N ∈ N (see Remark 3.3). We divide the interval [a, b]
into N equal parts and ﬁx t ∈ [0, τ ]. We also introduce the variables xk;i and
zj with k = 0, . . . , n, i = 0, . . . , N , and j = 1, . . . , N + 1. The variable k is
related to the order of the derivative of x, i is related to the ith subinterval
of [−τ, N τ ], and j is related to the jth subinterval of [0, (N + 1)τ ] as follows:

xk;i(t) = x(k)(t + (i − 1)τ ),

zj(t) = z(t + (j − 1)τ ),

˙zj(t) = Lj(t),

xk;N +1(t) = 0,

˙zN +1(t) = LN +1 = 0

(3.1)

with

Lj(t) := L(cid:0)t + (j − 1)τ, x0;j(t), . . . , xn;j(t), x0;j−1(t), . . . , xn;j−1(t), zj (t)(cid:1) .

Finally, the higher-order problem of Herglotz with time delay (Hn
written as an optimal control problem without time delay as follows:

τ ) can be

zN (τ ) −→ extr,

subject to

(3.2)

˙xk;i(t) = xk+1;i(t),

for all t ∈ [0, τ ] and with the initial conditions

γ ∈ R,

zj(0) = zj−1(τ )

for k = 0, . . . , n − 1, i = 0, . . . , N and j = 1, . . . , N . In this form we look to
xk;i and zj as state variables and to ui := xn;i as the control variables.

Remark 3.3. We considered the case of b being an integer multiple of
τ .
If b is not an integer multiple of τ , then there is an integer N such
that (N − 1)τ < b < N τ .
In that case, the only modiﬁcation required
in the change of variables given in (3.1) is to consider the variables xk;N ,
k = 0, . . . , n, and ˙zN as deﬁned in (3.1) for t ∈ [0, b − (N − 1)τ ] and zero for
t ∈]b − (N − 1)τ, τ ]. With this slight change, the functional to be extremized
remains the same and we can consider, without loss of generality, b to be an
integer multiple of τ .

3.2. Higher-order Euler–Lagrange and DuBois–Reymond optimal-
ity conditions with time delay. We begin by proving a necessary condi-
τ ). Along the
tion for a pair (x(·), z(·)) to be an extremizer to problem (Hn

have been clearly stated before.

dealing with piecewise functions instead of continuous, the theorem presents
a similar conserved quantity but without the imposition of two additional
hypotheses required in [15]. Moreover, the current deﬁnition of invariance
is more general than the one considered in [15].

4. Conclusion

Optimal control is a convenient tool to deal with delayed and non-delayed
Herglotz type variational problems. In this work we have shown how some of
the central results from the classical calculus of variations can be proved for
higher-order Herglotz variational problems with time delay from analogous
and well-known optimal control results. The techniques here developed can
now be used to obtain other results. For example, our optimal control
approach can be employed together with [20] to derive an extension of the
second Noether theorem to the delayed or non-delayed Herglotz framework.
This is under investigation and will be addressed elsewhere.
