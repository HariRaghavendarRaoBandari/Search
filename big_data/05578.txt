ABSTRACT
We investigate a method to construct parametrized progenitor models for core-collapse
supernova simulations. Diﬀerent from all modern core-collapse supernova studies,
which rely on progenitor models from stellar evolution calculations, we follow the
methodology of Baron & Cooperstein (1990) to construct initial models. Choosing
parametrized spatial distributions of entropy and electron fraction as a function of
mass coordinate and solving the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium, we obtain the
initial density structures of our progenitor models. First, we calculate structures with
parameters ﬁtting broadly the evolutionary model s11.2 of Woosley et al. (2002). We
then demonstrate the reliability of our method by performing general relativistic hy-
drodynamic simulations in spherical symmetry with the isotropic diﬀusion source
approximation to solve the neutrino transport. Our comprehensive parameter study
< 0.4 kB nucleon−1) can ex-
shows that initial models with a small central entropy (∼
plode even in spherically symmetric simulations. Models with a large entropy (∼
> 6 kB
nucleon−1) in the Si/O layer have a rather large explosion energy (∼ 4 × 1050 erg) at
the end of the simulations, which is still rapidly increasing.

INTRODUCTION

Numerical simulations of core-collapse supernovae have
been showing signiﬁcant rapid development during the
last decade (see Janka 2012; Kotake et al. 2012; Burrows
2013; Foglizzo et al. 2015, for recent reviews and references
therein). Especially, multi-dimensional neutrino-radiation
hydrodynamic simulation, which consistently solve the equa-
tions of hydrodynamics and neutrino transport, become
a doable problem thanks to the advance in supercom-
puter performance and the development of eﬃcient nu-
merical schemes. After Buras et al. (2006), an increasing
number of authors have been presented multi-dimensional
simulations including some treatment of spectral neu-
trino transport, which obtained explosions (Marek & Janka
2009; Suwa et al. 2010; M¨uller et al. 2012; Bruenn et al.
2013; Pan et al. 2016; O’Connor & Couch 2015 for 2D and
Takiwaki et al. 2012; Melson et al. 2015; Lentz et al. 2015;
M¨uller 2015 for 3D), while other simulations produced fail-
ures, i.e., no explosion by neutrino heating (Burrows et al.
2006; Ott et al. 2008; Hanke et al. 2013; Dolence et al.

the explosion energy problem, that is, the explosion energies
obtained in these simulations (∼ 1050 erg) are much smaller
than the canonical observed values (∼ 1051 erg).

els (especially from Woosley et al. 2002; Limongi & Chieﬃ

the explosion characteristics

that
strongly depend on
the mass of the progenitor and on its internal structure.
However, it is still unclear which are the most important
quantities among those characterizing the internal structure
of a core-collapse supernova progenitor.

Because stellar evolutionary calculations are subject
to restrictions (see, e.g. Jones et al. 2015, for recent code
comparison), we decided to generate progenitor mod-
els by ourselves in a more systematic and manageable
way. To this end, we used the approach proposed by
Baron & Cooperstein (1990) to construct initial models. In
this approach one prescribes the distributions of entropy
and electron fraction (Ye) in a progenitor model as func-
tions of the mass coordinate, and one assumes hydrostatic
equilibrium to obtain the density structure from these dis-
tributions. The hydrodynamic evolution of the progenitor
models is then simulated employing a microscopic equation
of state.

Contrary to Baron & Cooperstein (1990), we apply
their approach to modern radiation hydrodynamic simula-
tions of neutrino-driven core-collapse supernovae. While a
neutrino-driven explosion is the current standard paradigm
for core-collapse supernovae, Baron & Cooperstein (1990)
were discussing the inﬂuence of progenitor properties on
the prompt explosion scenario, in which the prompt shock
resulting from core bounce was thought to cause the ex-
plosion. In particular, we have performed one-dimensional
(1D) general relativistic hydrodynamic simulations includ-
ing a detailed treatment of neutrino transport and a nuclear
equation of state, i.e., our study is more elaborate than that
of Baron & Cooperstein (1990).

Using this approach, we were able to perform a com-
prehensive parameter study which displays the dependen-
cies of the outcome of 1D core-collapse supernova simula-
tions on the properties of the progenitor models. In addi-
tion, our approach has the advantage over other numerical
studies of core-collapse supernovae, which all rely on pro-
genitor models from stellar evolutionary calculations (but
see Yamamoto & Yamada 2016), that initial conditions can
be studied, which extend those currently predicted by stellar
evolutionary calculations.

In section 2 we explain how we constructed the progen-
itor models, and in section 3 we describe our hydrodynamic
method and present the results of our simulations. We dis-
cuss in detail the inﬂuence of the progenitor properties on
the core-collapse supernova dynamics in section 4, and con-
clude in section 5 with a summary and discussion of our
results.

2 PROGENITOR MODELS

In this section, we explain the strategies to obtain progenitor
models for core-collapse supernova simulations. First of all,
we construct progenitor models resembling the stellar evo-
lutionary model s11.2 of Woosley et al. (2002), which has
been widely used in hydrodynamic simulations.

2.1 Hydrostatic equation

To construct a progenitor model for our hydrodynamic sim-
ulations, we solve the hydrostatic equation

dP
dM

= −

GM
4πr4 ,

(1)

where P, M, G, and r are the pressure, the mass coordinate,
the gravitational constant, and the radial coordinate, respec-
tively. The density is given by dM/dr = 4πr2ρ. To solve
Eq. (1) one needs to specify a value for the central density,
ρ0, which is one of parameters of this approach, and one
needs to have P given as a function of density ρ, entropy S,
and electron fraction Ye, i.e., an equation of state (EOS).

Following Baron & Cooperstein (1990), we change G →
geﬀG in Eq. (1), where geﬀ < 1 is a factor mimicking the fact
that the progenitors are no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium,
but already in a dynamic state. We used this procedure to
destabilize the core in a uniform way, because reducing in-
stead the pressure (by reducing the entropy or Ye) may lead
to undesirable eﬀects, like e.g., a strange mass accretion his-
tory (see Baron & Cooperstein 1990).

In the following subsections, we give the distributions
of S and Ye as functions of the mass coordinate M that we
used in our study. Given these functions, we integrate Eq. (1)
and obtain ρ(r) and M (r). Due to limited extent of the tab-
ular equation of state used in our simulations, we integrate
Eq. (1) outward in mass until the density drops below a value
of 103 g cm−3. We note that this Newtonian treatment of the
progenitor model is compatible with the general relativistic
treatment used in our hydrodynamic simulations, because
the central lapse function is 1 − α ≈ O(10−3) for the pro-
genitor models, i.e., the use of the Newtonian approximation
is well justiﬁed.

2.2 Entropy and electron fraction

Following Baron & Cooperstein (1990) the entropy as a
function of mass M of our progenitor models is given by

S(M 6 M1) = Sc + (S1 − Sc)(cid:18) M

M1(cid:19) ,
M2 − M1(cid:19) ,
S(M1 6 M 6 M2) = S1 + (S2 − S1)(cid:18) M − M1

S(M2 6 M 6 M4) = S2 = S3 = S4,

S(M4 6 M 6 M5) = S4 + (S5 − S4)(cid:18) M − M4

M5 − M4(cid:19) ,

S(M5 6 M ) = S5,

(see also Fig. 1). These two distributions contain the param-
eters M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, Sc, S1, S2, S5, Yec, Ye3, and
Ye4, which uniquely characterize the progenitor model.

The mass parameters have the following signiﬁcance for
an iron core which is undergoing silicon shell-burning after
the central convective core has been exhausted of fuel. M1
is the mass coordinate of the edge of the ﬁnal convection in
the radiative core, M2 is the mass coordinate of the inner
edge of the convection zone in the iron core, M3 is the mass
coordinate up to which the core matter is in nuclear statis-
tical equilibrium (NSE core), M4 is the iron core mass, and
M5 is the mass coordinate at the base of the silicon/oxygen
shell which has a much larger entropy than the iron core
(S5 ≫ S2) and consequently a much lower density.

Since the entropy distribution is a consequence of a
complicated sequence of burning and convection stages, its
proﬁle is more structured than the Ye proﬁle, because the
latter only depends on the electron capture timescale. Dif-
ferent from Baron & Cooperstein (1990), we used two ad-
ditional parameters, M5 and S5, in our study, because in
more recent stellar evolutionary models the locations do not
coincide where S and Ye increase strongly. Also note that in
Baron & Cooperstein (1990) the iron core mass is given by
(M3 + M4)/2, whereas it is M4 in our study.

According to stellar evolutionary calculations, these
above parameters vary from progenitor model to progeni-
tor model. For example, Sc varies from ∼ 0.5 to ∼ 2, and
the values of M5 range from ∼ 1.2 to ∼ 3.7 (see Table 4 in
the Appendix).

Fig. 2 shows the S (solid lines) and Ye (dotted lines)
distributions of the three models investigated in this study
(purple, blue, and green lines) compared to those of the
stellar evolutionary model s11.2 (red line) of Woosley et al.
(2002), which has been used in many core-collapse supernova
studies during the past decade. In Table 1 we give the corre-
sponding parameters of our three progenitor models, which
have the same Ye proﬁle, but diﬀer by the values of S1, S2,
and geﬀ . We used diﬀerent values of S1 and S2 to match the
density structure of the stellar evolutionary model s11.2, and
varied the value of geﬀ from 0.99 to 0.95. As shown in Fig. 3,

(2002), and the purple, blue, and green lines show the distribu-
tions of our models, whose parameters are given in Table 1.

all three models reproduce the density structure of model
s11.2 very well.

2.3 Density structures

The top panel of Fig. 3 shows the density structures of the
stellar evolutionary model s11.2 together with those of our
three corresponding progenitor models, which are obtained
by integrating Eq. (1) numerically. The bottom plot of this
panel, which displays the density distributions of our three
models normalized by that of the s11.2 model, proves that
our three models have almost the same density structure
as model s11.2, the error being less than a few 10% except
for the outermost layers (M
> 1.3M⊙) of our models. On
∼
the other hand, the temperature structures (bottom panel
in Fig. 3) of all of our three models diﬀer signiﬁcantly from
that of model s11.2 for M
< 1.0M⊙ because of they have
∼
quite diﬀerent entropy proﬁles from the s11.2 model.

Obviously the parameterized progenitor models of
Baron & Cooperstein (1990) can reproduce the progenitor
structure of stellar evolutionary models at collapse consid-
erably well. The model parameters that ﬁt the structural
properties of other progenitor models are given in Appendix
A.

In
IDSA the electron neutrino and electron anti-neutrino dis-
tribution functions are split into two components, which are
solved with diﬀerent numerical techniques.

The weak interaction rates implemented in our code
are based on Mezzacappa & Bruenn (1993), and the cool-

scheme. Neutrino-electron scattering is also implemented
in this code according to Liebend¨orfer (2005) by express-
ing the electron fraction Ye as a function of ρ. However,

els and it is not always adequate, we did not employ it in
this work. The equation of state (EOS) used in our simu-
lations is that of Lattimer & Swesty (1991) with an incom-
pressibility K = 220 MeV for ρ > 108 g cm−3 and that of
Timmes & Arnett (1999) for ρ < 108 g cm−3. In the lat-
ter density range the average nuclear mass number A and
atomic number Z are assumed to be the same as in the EOS
of Lattimer & Swesty (1991) at ρ = 108 g cm−3. We follow
O’Connor & Ott (2010) to match the thermodynamic quan-
tities of both EOS tables at the transition density. The min-
imum density of of our combined EOS table is 103 g cm−3.
Accordingly, the results of our study are based on the
use of a modern numerical tool that is well suited for sim-
ulations of neutrino-driven supernova explosions, because it
is able to handle general relativistic gravity, neutrino radi-
ation transport, and a nuclear equation of state. Nowadays
we know that all of these ingredients are of considerable im-
portance for a proper simulation of the supernova explosion
mechanism, but none of them were taken into account in the
work of Baron & Cooperstein (1990).

3.2 Results

Fig. 4 shows the central density as a function of time after
bounce for all investigated models based on s11.2. Because
our models were computed with diﬀerent values of geﬀ , they
bounce at diﬀerent times, which range from ∼ 390 to 170 ms.
The density evolution of the stellar evolutionary model s11.2
is very similar to that of model WHW02-s11.2-g0.975 (al-
though the central density of the model slightly decreases

and ≈ 1014 g cm−3 (dotted lines), respectively. At the earlier
snapshot (ρc = 1011 g cm−3), the temperature distribution
of model WHW02-s11.2-g0.95 is quite diﬀerent, because its
initial temperature proﬁle diﬀered signiﬁcantly from those
of all other models. At later times all models evolved quite
similarly. The early electron fraction distributions exhibit
larger diﬀerence than those of the other quantities, because
the electron capture rate strongly depends on temperature
(∝ T 6), i.e., a small diﬀerence in temperature can result
in a large diﬀerence in Ye. However, once β−equilibrium is
achieved, the Ye distributions of the models become quite
similar (see dotted lines in bottom panel).

In Fig. 6 we display the evolution of the mass accre-
tion rate measured at a radius of 300 km (top panel) and of
the electron neutrino (solid lines) and electron antineutrino
(dashed lines) luminosities of the stellar evolutionary model
s11.2 and of our three corresponding progenitor models. Be-
cause of small diﬀerences in the density structures of the
models, both the mass accretion rates and the neutrino lu-
minosities diﬀer slightly between the models. About 50 ms
post bounce, model s11.2 has the smallest mass accretion
rate because the density gradient at M ≈ 1.3M⊙ is steepest
for this model. At later times (∼ 100 ms post bounce) the
mass accretion rate is largest in this model, because its den-
sity is the largest of all models in the relevant mass range

implies that the collapse of our initially hydrostatic models
with geﬀ

genitor model s11.2, even though the former models do not
have any initial radial velocity.

and grey lines give the proﬁles of our parameterized models and

Fig. 7 illustrates the shock evolution after core bounce.
We deﬁne the shock position as the radius where the spe-
ciﬁc entropy reaches a value of 6 kB baryon−1. Model s11.2
has the largest peak shock radius among all the investigated
models, because it possesses the steepest density gradient
(see Fig. 3). This fact leads to a rapid decrease of the mass
accretion rate with radius and hence of the ram pressure
on the shock. Since the shock radius is determined by the
force balance between the thermal post-shock pressure and
the pre-shock ram pressure, a lower ram pressure gives rise
to a larger shock radius. Our three other corresponding pro-
genitor models also show slightly diﬀerent shock evolutions
because their mass accretion rates diﬀer from each other and
from that of model s11.2 (see Fig. 6).

4 PARAMETER DEPENDENCIES AND

EXPLOSION PROPERTIES

In the last section, we demonstrated the reliability of the new
method for constructing initial conditions for core-collapse
supernova simulations by comparing models constructed by
this method with a particular widely used presupernova
model (WHW02-s11.2). The hydrodynamic features of these
models agree with each other quite well. In Appendix A,
we provide ﬁtting parameters (see Table A1) which closely
approximate the density structures of other presupernova
models used in the literature (see Fig. A1).

Next we consider a second set of initial conditions dif-
fering from those reproducing progenitor models based on
stellar evolutionary calculations. In particular, we present
our numerical results for parameterized initial models based
on model 109 of Baron & Cooperstein (1990), which has a
relatively small central entropy and a small core mass, i.e.
its structure diﬀers signiﬁcantly from that of initial models
obtained with stellar evolutionary calculations. Thus, this
second set of parametrized initial models allows us to study
the dependence of the outcome of core-collapse supernova
simulations for quite diﬀerent initial conditions. The corre-
sponding model parameters are given in Table 2.

We ﬁrst changed the value of one parameter from model
to model (BC01 to BC15 in Table 2), and then we ﬁxed the
value of the central entropy to Sc = 0.4 and again changed

one of the other parameters from model to model(BC16 to
BC22 in Table 2). As we will show below, the reason for this
approach was that model BC02 gives rise to a successful ex-
plosion, i.e., the parameter space around this model is worth
investigating. We note that we restricted the parameters we
chose in our study by the condition that the density at M5
is larger than 103 g cm−3, which implies a lower limit for
the entropy or the electron fraction, because a low entropy
or electron fraction leads to a faster decrease of the density
with increasing mass coordinate.

In Table 3 we give the values of some quantities char-
acterizing the density structures of our second set of
parametrized models. Columns 2 to 4 give the radius (in
units of 108 cm), the density (in units of 106 g cm−3), and
the temperature (in units of 109 K) at the mass coordinate
M = M5, respectively. In the ﬁfth column we list the com-
pactness parameter ξM (O’Connor & Ott 2011), which is
deﬁned as

ξM =

M/M⊙

R(M )/1000 km

,

(10)

where R(M ) is the radius of the sphere containing a mass
M . Note that we use here the compactness parameter ξM5 ,
whereas O’Connor & Ott (2011) considered ξM =2.5M⊙ in-
stead. According to O’Connor & Ott (2011) smaller values
of ξM are better for explosions. Column 6 gives the param-
eter µM , deﬁned by Ertl et al. (2016) as

µM =

= 4πρR2(M ).

(11)

dM

dr (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)r=R(M )

Whereas Ertl et al. (2016) obtained the value of dM/dr
by computing the numerical derivative of dM/dr at the
mass shell where S = 4kB baryon−1 with a mass interval of
0.3M⊙, we used for simplicity the second equality in Eq. (11)
to compute dM/dr analytically. Ertl et al. (2016) showed
that for a given value of MS=4 (the mass coordinate where
S = 4kB baryon−1), a smaller value of µM is better for an
explosion. Finally, the last column gives the total binding
energy of the initial model, which includes the contribution
of the internal energy.

Fig. 8 shows the structure of our second set of parame-
terized models (solid lines) in a density-temperature plane.

Figure 9. Evolution of the diagnostic explosion energy for model
BC18.

The additional grey lines give the structures of the models
listed in Appendix A, which are obtained by stellar evolu-
tion calculations. Obviously, our parametrized models show
a similar trend as the evolutionary ones, except for their
non-monotonic behavior at densities ρ ∼ 107 g cm−3 and
at densities of a few times 109 g cm−3, i.e. near the center.
In other words, these models allow us to investigate ther-
modynamic regimes beyond those encountered in canonical
models.

The Chandrasekhar mass is often used as a rough esti-
mate of the iron core mass. Since the former mass depends
on the electron fraction as

Mch ≈ 5.87Y 2

e M⊙

= 1.01(cid:18) Ye

0.415(cid:19)2

M⊙,

(12)

(13)

our small iron core (M4 = 1.15M⊙) can be unstable.

In Table 4 we provide an overview of the hydrody-
namic simulations with our second set of models. The table
columns give the time until bounce, the postbounce time
when the shock reaches a radius of 400 km, the ﬁnal time of
the simulation, the maximum shock radius, the ﬁnal bary-
onic mass of the PNS, and the diagnostic explosion energy
at the times when the shock reaches a radius of 1000km and
at tﬁn, respectively. The remaining columns give the mini-
mum inner core mass, the value of Ye in the center at tbounce,
and the initial kinetic energy. The PNS mass is deﬁned as
the mass with ρ > 1011 g cm−3, and the diagnostic explo-
sion energy as the integral of the local energy, i.e. the sum
of the speciﬁc internal, kinetic and gravitational energies,
of all zones where this quantity and the radial velocity are
positive. Here we used the general relativistic expression for
the local energy of M¨uller et al. (2012), which is given as

elocal = α(cid:2)(cid:0)ρc2 + ǫc2 + P(cid:1) W 2

− P(cid:3) − ρW c2,

where α is the lapse function, c the speed of light, ǫ the
speciﬁc internal energy, and W the Lorentz factor. This ex-
pression reduces to the well-known Newtonian expression
(elocal = ρφ + ρv2/2 + ρǫ with φ and v being the gravi-
tational potential and the velocity, respectively) when one
omits higher-order terms like (v/c)2.

(14)

For model BC18, which produces the most energetic
explosion of our second set of models, Sc = 0.4 and

S5 = 6 kB baryon−1. The diagnostic explosion energy of this
model already reaches 0.39 B (= 3.9 × 1050 erg) at the end
of the simulation, and it is still increasing (see Fig. 9) at a
rate of 5 B s−1, i.e., it will reach a value of 1 B about 310 ms
after core bounce.

Concerning the explosion energy one should note that
the envelope located above the Si/O layer has a large binding
energy of O(1049) to O(1051), the actual value depending on
the ZAMS mass of the progenitor (e.g. Pejcha & Thompson
2015). Therefore, the values given in Table 4 are not the
observable explosion energies. To determine the latter ener-
gies, one needs to perform long-term simulations including
the stellar envelopes, which will be left for future work.

For our second set of models, the electron fraction at
bounce is larger than in the simulations with our ﬁrst set
of models based on the stellar evolutionary model s11.2
(see previous section and Fig. 5), in which Yc,bounce ≈ 0.3.
Because of their smaller initial central entropy, the latter
models have a lower temperature, which implies a smaller
electron capture rate during collapse. The resulting larger
electron fractions explain the larger kinetic energies at the
bounce (see, e.g. M¨uller 1998), which are given by the ki-
netic energy of the inner core at the “last good homology”
(Brown et al. 1982). Of the models listed in the upper part
of Table 4, model BC02 has the largest initial kinetic energy.
Among these models, model BC02 is also the only explod-
ing model. Although a higher value of Yec also leads to a
larger value of Yc,bounce and a larger initial kinetic energy
(see model BC19 in the lower part of Table 4), model BC19
does not explode because of its larger gravitational binding
energy (see Table 3). However, we note that in comparison to
the other non-exploding models (BC16-BC18, BC20-BC22),
the shock propagates out to an exceptionally large maximum
shock radius of 873 km in model BC19, i.e, it is a marginal
model marking the boundary between exploding and non-
exploding models.

In all exploding models the explosion sets in early (∼
20 ms after core bounce), which seems to suggest a prompt
explosion. However, these explosions are still aided by neu-
trino heating, i.e., they diﬀer from prompt explosion models,
in which initial kinetic energy is large enough to eject the
envelope. To validate this statement, we performed a simu-
lation without neutrino heating by setting the distribution
function of streaming particles, which is essential for neu-
trino heating in IDSA (see Liebend¨orfer et al. 2009), to zero.
Then, the exploding model does no longer explode, i.e., it
was no prompt explosion.

From these result, we conclude that the iron core struc-
ture is crucial for obtaining an explosion. Especially, a low
entropy at the center helps to make an explosion. To reach
a more general conclusion, we need a large number of sim-
ulations covering a wider range of parameter space, which
will be reported in a forthcoming publication.

5 SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

In this paper, we investigated a method to construct
parametrized initial progenitor models for core-collapse su-
pernova simulations. So far, initial conditions of these simu-
lations have been taken from the ﬁnal phase of stellar evolu-
tionary calculations, which depend on several uncertainties,

like the treatments of semi-convection, overshooting, and
composition mixing. In particular, many phenomenological
treatments are employed to approximate multi-dimensional
eﬀects in evolution simulations done in spherical symme-
try.2 In this paper, we proposed a alternative methodol-
ogy to construct initial conditions. This is not a completely
new idea and we reused a method by Baron & Cooperstein
(1990). However, diﬀerent from these authors, we used the
latest input microphysics including neutrino transfer, a mi-
croscopic nuclear equation of state and general relativistic
hydrodynamics. In their paper, they presented functions of
entropy and electron fraction expressed by mass coordinate.
With these functions and solving hydrostatic equation, we
can construct initial density structures.

First of all, we constructed structures with parameters
ﬁtting the commonly used model s11.2 from Woosley et al.
(2002) and showed the similarity between our models
and the model s11.2. We then performed general rela-
tivistic neutrino-radiation hydrodynamics simulations in
spherical
symmetry with the public code Agile-IDSA

2 Recently, aspherical ﬂuid motion has been paid attention to
amplify explodability (Couch & Ott 2013; M¨uller & Janka 2015;
Couch et al. 2015).

MNRAS 000, 1–10 (2016)

(Liebend¨orfer et al. 2009)3 and showed the reliability of our
method. Next, we constructed models based on parameters
given in Baron & Cooperstein (1990) and studied parame-
ter dependencies. Interestingly, we found several exploding
models with small central entropy even in spherically sym-
metric simulations. More surprisingly, models with a large
entropy in the Si/O layer give rather large explosion ener-
gies, ∼ 4 × 1050 erg at the ﬁnal time of our simulations, and
the energy still being increasing.

Nevertheless of the large explosion energy (

> 4 × 1050
∼
erg), we ﬁnd that the PNS masses are rather small (∼ 1.1M⊙
in baryonic mass) for exploding models, so that these explo-
sions are not fully compatible with observations. This dis-
crepancies will be reduced when we use multi-dimensional
simulations, since multi-dimensional eﬀects amplify neutrino
heating and explodability signiﬁcantly. With multi-D simu-
lations, we may ﬁnd parameter sets leading to a large ex-
plosion energy, ∼ 1051 erg, and a typical NS gravitational
mass, ∼ 1.3–2.0 M⊙, which is typically ∼ 10% smaller than
the baryonic mass. A broader parameter survey is necessary
to explore these more promising combinations.

Suwa and M¨uller

In this study we considered diﬀerent entropy stratiﬁca-
tions in the initial models, and did not pay much attention
to the temperature proﬁles. But the temperature is crucially
important for nuclear synthesis and an energy generation
rate in burning layers. Therefore, our current model might
not be fully consistent with stellar evolution and an improve-
ment will be presented in the forthcoming papers.

This work is the very ﬁrst step toward investigating ini-
tial conditions other than those resulting from stellar evo-
lutionary calculations. The virtue of the method used in
our study is that we can choose initial conditions beyond
those predicted by current stellar evolutionary calculations.
Hence, we may be able to ﬁnd robust conditions for energetic
explosions, i.e. explosions in which the energy is larger than
the canonical value 1051 erg. This is one of the important
goals for the core-collapse supernova simulation community.

APPENDIX A: FITTING OTHER
PROGENITOR MODELS

In the main text, we discussed a set of models based on
the stellar evolutionary model s11.2 of Woosley et al. (2002),
since it is a well studied model in the literature. In this ap-
pendix, we give the ﬁtting parameters (Table A1) and den-
sity structures (Fig. A1) of parameterized models reproduc-
ing other typical progenitor models for convenience.
