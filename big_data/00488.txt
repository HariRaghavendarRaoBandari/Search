ABSTRACT
We present deep new GTC/OSIRIS narrow-band images and optical WHT/ISIS long-
slit spectroscopy of the merging system Mrk273 that show a spectacular extended halo
of warm ionised gas out to a radius of ∼ 45 kpc from the system nucleus. Outside of the
immediate nuclear regions (r > 6 kpc), there is no evidence for kinematic disturbance
in the ionised gas: in the extended regions covered by our spectroscopic slits the
emission lines are relatively narrow (FWHM (cid:46) 350 kms−1) and velocity shifts small
(|∆V| (cid:46) 250 kms−1). This is despite the presence of powerful near-nuclear outﬂows
(FWHM > 1000 kms−1; |∆V| > 400 kms−1; r < 6 kpc). Diagnostic ratio plots are fully
consistent with Seyfert 2 photo-ionisation to the NE of the nuclear region, however to
the SW the plots are more consistent with low-velocity radiative shock models. The
kinematics of the ionised gas, combined with the fact that the main structures are
aligned with low-surface-brightness tidal continuum features, are consistent with the
idea that the ionised halo represents tidal debris left over from a possible triple-merger
event, rather than a reservoir of outﬂowing gas.

1 INTRODUCTION
Major gas-rich mergers are believed to be a key mechanism
in driving galaxy evolution, where two (or multiple) galaxies
coalesce, forcing gas and dust towards the nuclear regions
and triggering both starburst and AGN activity. (e.g. Di
Matteo et al. 2005). The nuclear activity can create highly
energetic outﬂows which blast material out of the galaxies,
suppressing star formation and shaping the evolution of the
systems.

It is well established that ultraluminous infrared galax-
ies (ULIRGs) in the local Universe are triggered close to
the peaks of major mergers between gas-rich spiral galax-
ies. (e.g. Sanders et al. 1988; Veilleux et al. 2002). Local
ULIRGs are therefore ideal laboratories for detailed study,
as they represent the phase in which nuclear outﬂows are
expected to have the most signiﬁcant eﬀects on the host
galaxy. Nuclear outﬂows have been detected in ULIRGs in
all phases; from ionised (e.g. Rodríguez Zaurín et al. 2013)
to neutral (e.g. Rupke & Veilleux 2011) to molecular (e.g.
Cicone et al. 2014), and it has been shown that the velocity
widths (FWHM) and radial shifts of these outﬂows are sub-
stantially greater in ULIRGs showing signs of AGN activity
(e.g. Rodríguez Zaurín et al. 2013; Veilleux et al. 2013). Pre-

vious observations, however, have focused on a radius of only
a few kpc from the nucleus and evidence for larger-scale out-
ﬂows is lacking, leading to uncertainties in quantifying the
energetics. It is now important to determine the true spatial
extents of these outﬂows and investigate the ultimate fate
of the outﬂowing gas.

In order to address these issues, we are undertaking a
deep imaging and spectroscopic survey of a complete sample
of 32 nearby ULIRGs. As part of this study we have observed
Mrk273, one of the closest ULIRGs (z = 0.0373, LIR =
1012.21L(cid:12)) and a key target for detailed study. This ob-
ject shows evidence for three nuclei: two detected at near-
and mid-IR wavelengths and a third detected in [OIII] and
radio emission (Rodríguez Zaurín et al. (2014); hereafter
RZ14). The previous HST imaging and spectroscopic ob-
servations of RZ14 also shows a loop of [OIII] emission ex-
tending ∼20 kpc to the east of the nuclear region, as well as
highly disturbed emission line kinematics within a radius of
6 kpc (see also Rupke & Veilleux (2013), RV13). The slits
for these spectroscopic observations, however, did not sam-
ple the full extent of the halo, and the HST imaging did not
probe the low-surface brightness features. The present study
builds on this work and combines deep GTC/OSIRIS imag-
ing with WHT/ISIS long-slit spectra in order to investigate
the kinematics and ionisation mechanism of the extended
halo of Mrk273. We adopt H0 = 68kms−1, Ωm = 0.29 and

ΩΛ = 0.71. The systemic redshift of the source gives a lumi-
nosity distance of DL = 171.5 Mpc and a scale of 0.762 kpc
arcsec−1.

Imaging data

2 OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION
2.1
Hα Tunable ﬁlter (TF) imaging observations were taken
for Mrk273 using the OSIRIS instrument1 mounted on the
10.4m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC). To sample the
Hα emission from the galaxy, the TF was centered on
6810.7±2.0Å (i.e. the red-shifted Hα wavelength for the
galaxy) and used with order sorter ﬁlter f680/43 (λcentral
= 6802.1Å; FWHM = 432Å). These narrow-band obser-
vations had an eﬀective bandpass of 17.7Å, sensitive to
|∆VHα| < 400kms−1. In addition, a medium-band contin-
uum image blueward of Hα was taken using the OSIRIS red
Order Sorter (OS) Filter f657/35 (λcentral = 6572Å; FWHM
= 350Å). The exposure times were 1680 and 270 seconds for
the Hα and the continuum images respectively.

The TF and OS ﬁlter OSIRIS images were bias and ﬂat-
ﬁeld corrected in the usual way. For the ﬂux calibration, a
photometric standard star was observed using exactly the
same set up as for the galaxy. A ﬂux calibration factor was
then derived using a customised python routine that gener-
ates a TF transmission curve for a given central wavelength
and FWHM.

Any night sky lines contained within the bandwidth of
the ﬁlter cause ring structures in the TF images. To remove
such sky emission, a series of 1D polynomials were ﬁtted in
the x- and y-directions which generated a synthetic image
containing only the sky emission. This image was then sub-
tracted from the original, ﬂux calibrated image of the source
resulting in an image cleaned from any background and sky
emission with the faintest visible structures having a surface
brightness of ∼ 1.1 × 10−17ergcm−1s−1arcsec−2 Full details
on this process will be provided in Spence et al. (2016, in
preparation).

2.2 Spectroscopic data
Follow-up long-slit spectroscopic observations were taken in
June 2014 using the Intermediate dispersion Spectrograph
and Imaging System (ISIS) on the WHT telescope at the Ob-
servatorio del Roque de los Muchachos (ORM), La Palma.
The 1.5" slit was oﬀset by 2.7±0.1" (2.1±0.1 kpc) to the east
of the continuum centre and positioned at PA 23 in order
to include the extended emission to the NE of the nucleus
and to the west of the tidal tail. The slit position is indi-
cated in Figure 1d. The observations were obtained using a
dichroic cutting at 6100Å, with R316R and R300B gratings.
This instrumental setup resulted in a spatial scale of 0.4
arcsec pix−1, and a spectral resolution of 5.4±0.1Å in the
blue and 5.0±0.1Å in the red, as calculated using the mean
widths (FWHM) of the night-sky lines. The data were re-
duced (bias subtracted, ﬂat ﬁeld corrected, cleaned of cosmic
rays, wavelength calibrated and then ﬂux calibrated) using
the standard packages in IRAF and FIGARO. The relative
ﬂux calibration was estimated to be accurate to within 5%.
The seeing for the observations was estimated to be 1.2±0.2
arcsec (FWHM).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Morphology
Our deep line-free continuum image of Mrk273 is presented
in Figure 1a. This shows the impressive tidal tail to the south
of the galaxy, which represents debris from the main merger.
The presence of a narrow dust lane in this tidal tail (RZ14)
suggests that the disk of the main merging galaxy – and
the plane of the main merger – is viewed close to edge-on.
Notable is the appearance of an extensive looped continuum
structure extending > 45 kpc to the east of the nucleus, at
an angle of ∼130o to the tidal tail. Assuming we are viewing
the plane of the main merger edge-on, this structure could
represent the tidal debris of a second merging galaxy which
is approaching the nucleus at a large angle to the plane of the
main merger. The conclusion that Mrk273 is a triple merger
is further supported by the presence of three nuclei in the
nuclear region (RZ14). We also ﬁnd signiﬁcant continuum
emission to the west of the main tidal tail, but much less
emission to the east.

Our deep continuum-subtracted Hα image is presented
in Figure 1b. This shows a spectacular nebula of ionised gas,
which stretches ∼ 40 kpc to the NE and SW of the nuclear
region, with lower surface brightness regions also visible >
45 kpc to the SE. It is notable that the Hα nebula to the
NE stretches in a similar direction and with a similar spatial
extent to the continuum loop. Note that the inner (< 20
kpc) higher surface brightness Hα knots were also detected
in [OIII] emission by RZ14. The substantial Hα emission
observed to the west of the main tidal tail is also striking,
as little [OIII] emission was detected in this region in the
previous HST imaging. This Hα emission is most prominent
to the west of the main tail, again following the continuum
emission. The composite colour image in Figure 1c highlights
this.

3.2 Kinematics
Figure 2 shows the velocity widths (FWHM) and radial ve-
locity shifts (∆V ) measured using single Gaussian ﬁts at
diﬀerent locations along the slit. The reference point (D = 0
kpc) was chosen to be the centroid of the continuum emis-
sion along the slit, roughly corresponding to the position of
closest approach to the nucleus. Broad lines (FWHM > 500
kms−1) are detected in the region where the slit intersects
the near-nuclear region. These velocities are in agreement
with previous studies (e.g. U et al. 2013; Rodríguez Zau-
rín et al. 2014) and indicate the presence of powerful near-
nuclear outﬂows. Apart from one region with large error bars
at r ∼ -8 kpc, these broad lines appear to be conﬁned to a
narrow range along the slit (0 (cid:46) r (cid:46) 5 kpc), corresponding
to a maximum radial distance of ∼6 kpc from the nucleus.
Outside the near-nuclear regions (r > 6 kpc), the Hα,
[NII]λ6583 and [OIII]λ5007 emission lines are relatively nar-
row (FWHM (cid:46) 350 kms−1), and the velocity widths small
(|∆ V| (cid:46) 250 kms−1). All emission lines are well ﬁt with
single Gaussians and show no signs of multiple kinematic
components. We ﬁnd the same quiescent kinematics in the
extended regions in all our other slits, four from RZ14 and
one from Rodríguez Zaurín et al. (2009) (indicated on Fig-
ure 1d). Despite extreme outﬂows with velocities up to 1500
kms−1 in the near-nuclear regions, these observations pro-
vide no clear evidence of the outﬂow extending beyond a
radius of ∼ 6 kpc.

Ionisation mechanism

3.3
The ionisation mechanism for the emission lines observed at
diﬀerent locations across Mrk273 was investigated using the
Baldwin, Phillips & Terlovich (BPT) diagnostic diagrams
(Baldwin et al. 1981; Veilleux & Osterbrock 1987). The dia-
grams are shown in Figure 3. Over-plotted on the ﬁrst dia-
gram are the theoretical "maximum starburst line" derived
by Kewley et al. (2001) as an upper limit for star-forming
galaxies (solid), and the semi-empirical lower boundary for
star-forming galaxies derived by Kauﬀmann et al. (2003)
(dashed). The area between these lines deﬁnes the compos-
ite region. Over-plotted on the second and third diagrams
are the main AGN and Seyfert2/LINER empirical divid-
ing lines from Kewley et al. (2006). Also over-plotted over
all three diagrams are the Allen et al. (2008) pre-cursor +
shock model grids for solar abundance and pre-shock density
of 10cm−3. The grids range in magnetic ﬁeld (1 < B < 100
µG) and in shock velocity (200 < v < 1000 kms−1). A total
of 9 apertures across the slit (denoted a to i) were analysed,

sampling the extended emission to the NE and SW of the
nuclear region, as well as the near-nuclear region. Figure 1d
shows the location of these apertures. For clarity, apertures
a and b will be denoted "NE", c to e as "Near-nuclear" and
f to i as "SW". The apertures are also indicated on the plots
in Figure 2 for comparison.

The line ratios measured for both the NE neb-
ula and nuclear regions are fully consistent with AGN
(NLAGN/Sy2) photo-ionisation in all three diagnostic plots.
The agreement with the shock models for these regions
is poorer, particularly for the [OI]/Hα ratio. This agrees
with RZ14 who found that all areas of the nuclear region
and extended ﬁlaments to the NE covered by their obser-
vations were consistent with Sy2 photo-ionisation, and the
shock models generally failed to reproduce the line ratios.
The case for Sy2 photo-ionisation in these regions is fur-
ther supported by the detection of HeIIλ4686 emission to
the NE. A HeIIλ4686/Hβ ratio of 0.30±0.05 was measured
in aperture b, consistent with the typical values for AGN
(HeIIλ4686/Hβ > 0.2; Osterbrock & Ferland (2006)).

Disregarding the aperture at ∼-8 kpc due to large error bars, quiescent gas (FWHM (cid:46) 350 km s−1) is found outside the range 0 < r <
5 kpc, corresponding to radial distance distance of ∼6 kpc from the nucleus. No complex kinematics are seen. The main apertures used
to investigate the ionisation mechanism are indicated by the shaded areas. b) the velocity shifts relative to the continuum centre. Note
there is an intrinsic uncertainty on these relative shifts due to the slit being oﬀset from the system centre.

The nebula to the SW was not covered by the spectro-
scopic observations presented in RZ14 and is covered here
by apertures f through i. There is an obvious division in Fig-
ure 3 between the ratios observed in the NE and SW of the
galaxy, with the positions of the SW apertures more consis-
tent with composite/LINER photo-ionisation than Sy2. The
shock models reproduce the line ratios measured to the SW
consistently across all three diagnostic plots, with shock ve-
locities in the range 200 - 400 kms−1. These shock velocities
are also consistent with the velocity widths measured at this
location (Figure 2a). In comparison, AGN photo-ionisation
models (Groves et al. 2004) do not reproduce the line ratios
across all three plots with the same level of consistency.

3.4 Electron density, temperature and gas mass
Single Gaussians were ﬁtted to the [SII]λλ6717,6731 emis-
sion lines in the extended apertures (a,b,f,g,h and i) to de-
termine the electron density, and an error-weighted mean ra-
tio of [SII]λ(6717/6731) = 1.4±0.1 was obtained, consistent
with the low density limit. This leads to a 3σ upper limit es-
timate of the density across the halo of ne ≤ 430cm−3 using
the nebular modeling package FIVEL (De Robertis et al.
1987). The detection of [OIII]λ4363 in aperture b also al-
lowed an estimate of the electron temperature. The ratio of
the [OIII]λλ(4959+5007)/4363 emission lines is 85±20, re-
sulting in an electron temperature of T = (1.37+1.8−0.9)×104K.
Reddening is important in the nuclear regions of
Mrk273 due to the large amounts of gas and dust present,
however in the extended regions of our slit the degree of
reddening appears to be small. We found an error weighted
mean for Hα/Hβ across the extended apertures of 3.1±0.1,
consistent with case B recombination for AGN (Gaskell &
Ferland 1984).

A lower limit for the warm gas mass of the extended halo
(r > 6 kpc) was estimated using the Hα luminosity (L(Hα)
= 1.02 × 1041ergs−1), measured in the extended regions by
integrating the ﬂux over the whole system (raperture = 45
kpc) and subtracting that of the nuclear region (raperture=
6 kpc). Combining this with the eﬀective recombination co-

ef f = 0.77 × 10−13, for case B gas at 104K (see
eﬃcient, αHα
Pequignot et al. (1991)) and the upper limit on the density
presented earlier leads to a lower limit on the total halo gas
mass of Mhalo (cid:38) 8 × 105M(cid:12).

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
New GTC/OSIRIS and WHT/ISIS observations have been
used to investigate the kinematics and ionisation mechanism
of the extended halo of warm ionised gas surrounding the
nuclear regions of Mrk273. Mrk273 shows both extended
structure and extreme nuclear kinematics, which makes it
an excellent object for investigating the connection between
AGN-induced outﬂows and the host galaxy. AGN feedback
is expected to be important to the evolution of galaxies
yet current observational evidence is lacking for the impact
of these outﬂows outside of the nuclear regions, on scales
greater than a few kpc. This raises the question: to what
extent do the AGN-driven outﬂows truly inﬂuence the outer
regions of their host galaxies, and what is the ultimate fate
of the outﬂowing gas?

Studies have shown the presence of an ionised outﬂow
out to a 6 kpc radius from the nuclear regions of Mrk273.
Therefore, one possibility is that the ionised gas in the ex-
tended nebula represents a reservoir of gas expelled from
past/current outﬂows. Outﬂowing gas is generally identiﬁed
by large velocity shifts and broad widths (FWHM) in emis-
sion line proﬁles. The shifts measured for the extended halo
within our slit, however, are small (|∆V (cid:46) 250 kms−1) and
the line widths narrow (FWHM (cid:46) 350 kms−1) – inconsistent
with the values observed in the nuclear regions by RV13 and
RZ14. This is only consistent with the idea that the warm
halo represents the accumulated reservoir of the outﬂowing
gas if the turbulence in the outﬂow is somehow dissipated
outside the near-nuclear regions. On the other hand, the rel-
atively quiescent kinematics of the extended gas are entirely
consistent with gravitational motions, given that the esti-
mated total stellar mass of Mrk273 (7× 1011M(cid:12); Rodríguez
Zaurín et al. (2010)) is similar to that of the Milky Way.
Furthermore, RV13 found a mass outﬂow rate of 10

lines are described in section 3.3. Also shown are the Allen et. al (2008) shock-ionisation model grids. The gridlines correspond to 3 values
of magnetic ﬁeld (B=1, 10 and 100 µG) and 9 shock velocities (Vs = 200, 300...1000 kms−1). Vs increases from bottom to top. The
gridlines are grey-coded from light-grey to black, with light-grey corresponding to the lowest and highest values of B and Vs. Notable is a
clear divide between the northern and southern apertures suggesting diﬀerent mechanisms dominate the two regions. The shock models
are consistent with the SW ratios, but a poorer consistency is seen for the ratios in the NE.

.

M(cid:12)yr−1 for the inner warm outﬂow (r < 4 kpc). Using
their typical outﬂow velocity of 750 kms−1, it would take
∼60 Myr to reach the outer extent of the halo (∼45 kpc).
Therefore the AGN would have a lifetime at least this long if
the entire halo represents a reservoir of outﬂowing gas. Over
this time the accumulated mass would be ∼ 6×108M(cid:12) for a
constant mass outﬂow rate of 10 M(cid:12)yr−1. This is a factor of
∼750 greater than the lower limit on the warm gas mass cal-
culated in section 3.4; therefore, in order for the two masses
to be consistent, the warm gas would have to be extremely
rareﬁed (ne (cid:46) 1cm−3).

The most likely origin for the ionised halo in Mrk273 is
gas left over from the merger(s) which triggered the activity.
This is supported by the continuum "loop" observed to the
NE of the nuclear region, which is clearly a tidal feature. The
Hα emission to the NE has a similar extent and stretches in
the same direction as the continuum loop, also indicative of
tidal debris.

We have analysed the ionisation mechanism for the
ionised gas using BPT diagrams and Allen et al. (2008) ra-
diative shock models. The model predicts the line ratios us-
ing a pre-cursor+shock model, with a pre-shock density of
ne = 10cm−3, consistent with a compression factor ∼10 -
40, assuming the electron density measured in section 3.4 is
post-shock. The line ratios measured to the NE and in the
near-nuclear regions are fully consistent with AGN photo-
ionisation on the BPT diagrams (Fig. 3). The Allen et. al
(2008) shock models, in comparison, are less successful at
reproducing the ratios (see also RZ14). These results lead
us to conclude that the gas to the NE is tidal debris which
is being illuminated by the nuclear AGN.

The situation in the SW is less clear, with the BPT dia-
grams indicating that AGN photo-ionisation is a less domi-
nant mechanism with respect to the NE and near-nuclear re-
gion. The line ratios fall mainly in the composite/LINER re-
gion and are also consistent with the Allen et. al (2008) low-
velocity radiative shock model, demonstrating that radiative
shocks have the potential to produce LINER-like emission.
Such low-velocity shocks can occur from collisions between
clouds of gas and dust as they settle down after disrup-

MNRAS 000, 1–6 (2015)

tion by the major merger. The predicted shock velocities are
in agreement with the measured velocity widths, shown in
Figure 2, for the SW apertures. In comparison, AGN photo-
ionisation models fail to reproduce the measured line ratios
with the same level of consistency. Moreover, similarly to
the NE, the ionised gas is observed to have a similar ex-
tent and direction as the continuum emission to the west
of the tidal tail. Together, these results support the conclu-
sion that the ionised gas to the SW is tidal debris which is
being ionised by low-velocity shocks caused by turbulence
from the merger(s).

Note that, if the SW gas were a reservoir from past
outﬂows then the outﬂows in this location would most likely
to be driven by intense star formation or supernovae in the
tidal tail, stimulated by the merger. However this would not
explain the asymmetry of the gas, as there would be no
reason for the outﬂows to be preferentially directed to the
west of the tidal tail. A further consideration is the travel
time for any outﬂowing gas to reach the extended region.
Although no evidence is seen here for large scale outﬂows,
perhaps in this particular ULIRG the central AGN have not
been active long enough for the outﬂows to reach kpc scales.
Overall, this study demonstrates the need for further
detailed observations of extended emission line gas in local
ULIRGs in order to probe the true extent of AGN-induced
nuclear outﬂows and discover their true impact on the evo-
lution of their host galaxies.
