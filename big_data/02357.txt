We report a study of the superconducting and normal-state properties of the ﬁlled-skutterudite
system PrPt4Ge12−xSbx. Polycrystalline samples with Sb concentrations up to x = 5 were synthe-
sized and investigated by means of x-ray diﬀraction, electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility,
and speciﬁc heat measurements. We observed a suppression of superconductivity with increasing
Sb substitution up to x = 4, above which, no signature of superconductivity was observed down
to 140 mK. The Sommerfeld coeﬃcient, γ, of superconducting specimens decreases with increasing
x up to x = 3, suggesting that superconductivity may depend on the density of electronic states
in this system. The speciﬁc heat for x = 0.5 exhibits an exponential temperature dependence in
the superconducting state, reminiscent of a nodeless superconducting energy gap. We observed
evidence for a weak “rattling” mode associated with the Pr ions, characterized by an Einstein tem-
perature ΘE ∼ 60 K for 0 ≤ x ≤ 5; however, the rattling mode may not play any role in suppressing
superconductivity.

INTRODUCTION

Filled-skutterudite compounds with the generic chem-
ical formula M T4X12, where M is an alkali metal, alka-
line earth, lanthanide, or actinide, T is a transition metal
from the Fe or Co column, and X is a pnictogen [1], have
been of interest to physicists and chemists worldwide due
to the various types of strongly correlated electron behav-
iors they exhibit and their potential for use in applica-
tions; intriguing properties studied in ﬁlled skutterudite
compounds include conventional BCS-type superconduc-
tivity, unconventional superconductivity, Kondo-lattice
behavior, valence ﬂuctuations, non-Fermi liquid behav-
ior, heavy-fermion behavior, Kondo-insulator behavior,
metal-insulator transitions, magnetic ordering, spin ﬂuc-
tuations, and quadrupolar order [2–16]. Filled skutteru-
dites also have demonstrated potential viability for use
in thermoelectric applications [3,14,15].

Among the ﬁlled-skutterudite compounds, Pr-based
systems, in particular, exhibit unusual physical proper-
ties [2,4,12,17,18], including a metal-insulator transition
and a low-ﬁeld ordered phase in PrRu4P12 and PrFe4P12,
respectively [17,19]. The heavy-fermion superconduct-
ing state in PrOs4Sb12 has attracted considerable inter-
est and was the ﬁrst such state to be discovered in a
Pr-based system. It has a very large Sommerfeld coef-
ﬁcient, γ ∼ 500 mJ/mol K2 [4,11], and exhibits uncon-
ventional superconductivity in which there is evidence
for time-reversal symmetry breaking [8], multiple super-
conducting bands [16,20,21], point nodes in the energy
gap [21,22], and potential spin-triplet pairing of elec-
trons [23].

Recently, a new class of ﬁlled-skutterudite compounds

with the chemical formula M Pt4Ge12 has been synthe-
sized and studied [24–30]. The compounds with M =
Sr, Ba, La, Pr, and Th have all been found to display
superconductivity. For (Sr,Ba)Pt4Ge12, the supercon-
ducting transition temperatures, Tc, are ∼ 5.4 and 5.1
K, respectively, and BCS-like superconductivity is ob-
served, originating from the Pt-Ge cage structure. For
(La,Pr)Pt4Ge12, superconductivity occurs at relatively
high temperatures of Tc ∼ 8.2 and 7.9 K, respectively.
Both LaPt4Ge12 and ThPt4Ge12 exhibit conventional
BCS-type superconductivity; however, ThPt4Ge12 was
also found to be a clean-limit strong-coupling supercon-
ductor with Tc = 4.6 K.

In contrast, the compound PrPt4Ge12 displays un-
conventional superconductivity that is similar to that
of PrOs4Sb12 in several ways. Transverse muon spin
relaxation (µSR) and speciﬁc heat measurements sug-
gest point nodes in the superconducting energy gap of
PrPt4Ge12, and zero-ﬁeld µSR measurements provide ev-
idence for time-reversal symmetry breaking in the su-
perconducting state [28,31]. The compound PrPt4Ge12
exhibits a similar type of multiband unconventional su-
perconductivity [32–34]. A recent study of Ce substitu-
tion into the ﬁller sites for Pr ions in PrPt4Ge12 reported
the suppression of superconductivity with increasing Ce
concentration and suggested a crossover from a nodal to
nodeless superconducting energy gap or the suppression
of multiple superconducting energy bands, revealing a
single, robust BCS-type superconducting energy gap [35].
A few studies attempting to understand the eﬀect of
chemical substitution within the Pt-Ge cage have been
conducted. Upon substitution of Au for Pt in BaPt4Ge12,
the electronic density of states and superconducting tran-

sition temperature Tc increase with increasing Au con-
centration [36]. The eﬀect of Sb substitution for Ge
has also been studied for several Pt-Ge based skutteru-
dite compounds: The compound CePt4Ge12 is close to a
boundary between Ce intermediate valence and Kondo-
lattice behavior [27,37]. By substituting Sb for Ge,
CePt4Ge12 is tuned from a nearly intermediate-valent
paramagnet, through a non-Fermi liquid phase, and into
an antiferromagnetically-ordered phase with localized Ce
4f magnetic moments [38,39]. A rapid suppression of
superconductivity in the system LaPt4Ge12−xSbx with
increasing x is observed, accompanied by a decrease of
charge-carrier density and an increase of the Seebeck ef-
fect at room temperature by about one order of magni-
tude [40].

Motivated by previous studies, and in order to fur-
ther investigate the unresolved nature of superconduc-
tivity in the compound PrPt4Ge12, we undertook a sys-
tematic study of the PrPt4Ge12−xSbx system. The evo-
lution of superconducting properties with increasing Sb
concentration was investigated by means of x-ray diﬀrac-
tion, electrical resistivity in zero and applied magnetic
ﬁelds, DC and AC magnetic susceptibility, and speciﬁc
heat measurements. We observed a suppression of super-
conductivity with positive curvature in a plot of Tc ver-
sus Sb concentration; above x = 4, there is no evidence
for superconductivity down to 140 mK. Our results from
speciﬁc heat measurements is similar to that of previous
studies, suggesting a possible crossover from a nodal to
a nodeless superconducting energy gap or from multiple
energy gaps to a single BCS-type superconducting en-
ergy gap [32–35]. Evidence for a “rattling” mode for the
Pr ions was observed throughout the series, but does not
seem to have a strong eﬀect on superconductivity. Con-
jectures about an observed feature or phase transition of
unknown origin above x = 4 are also discussed.

II. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

Polycrystalline specimens of PrPt4Ge12−xSbx were
synthesized by arc-melting on a water-cooled copper
hearth under an Ar atmosphere with a Zr getter. The
starting materials were obtained from Pr ingots (Alfa Ae-
sar 99.9%), Pt sponge (99.9999+%), Ge pieces (Alfa Ae-
sar 99.9999+%), and Sb pieces (Alfa Aesar 99%). These
starting materials were weighed out in accordance with
the stoichiometric ratios and arc-melted, turned over,
and arc-melted again a total of ﬁve times to promote
homogeneity of the samples. The arc-melted boules were
then annealed in sealed quartz ampoules (containing 150
torr of Ar at room temperature) for 336 hours at 750
◦C. The crystal structure was determined by x-ray pow-
der diﬀraction (XRD) using a Bruker D8 Discover x-
ray diﬀractometer with Cu-Kα radiation, and XRD pat-
terns were analyzed via Rietveld reﬁnement using the
GSAS+EXPGUI software package [41,42]. The electri-
cal resistivity was measured from 1.1 K to 300 K us-

2

ing a standard four-wire method with a Linear Research
LR700 AC resistance bridge in a home-built probe in a
liquid 4He Dewar, and down to 140 mK using a commer-
cial 3He-4He dilution refrigerator. Magnetic susceptibil-
ity measurements were performed between 2 K and 300
K in magnetic ﬁelds up to 7 T using a Quantum Design
Magnetic Property Measurement System (MPMS). Al-
ternating current magnetic susceptibility measurements
were made down to ∼ 1.1 K in a liquid 4He Dewar using
home-built mutual inductance coils. Speciﬁc heat mea-
surements were carried out at temperatures down to 1.8
K with a Quantum Design Physical Property Measure-
ment System (PPMS) DynaCool.

from XRD data

for
PrPt4Ge12−xSbx (0 ≤ x ≤ 5). All of the XRD patterns
are well indexed with the cubic ﬁlled-skutterudite crys-
tal structure with space group Im¯3. The conventional
residual parameters, Rp, are in the range from 0.0910
to 0.1595 for x ≤ 5. Figure 1(a) shows a representative
XRD pattern for the PrPt4Ge12−xSbx system (for x =
3.5) and the resultant ﬁt from the Rietveld reﬁnement.
The stars indicate the presence of Pr and/or PtSb2 im-
purity phases, the amount of which gradually increases
with x from ∼ 0.2 to 1% by mass ratios for 3 ≤ x ≤ 5.
Additionally, Ge, PrSb2, and PrPtGe impurities were
observed; however, the amount of these impurities is
less than 1% by mass ratio, suggesting very weak eﬀects
on the properties of these samples. For samples with
x ≥ 6, the dominant phase is PtSb2; the mass ratios of
PtSb2 by Rietveld reﬁnement are 6% and 52% for x =
6 and 7, respectively, indicating the solubility limit is
near or just beyond x = 6. This result is consistent with
the observation that the lattice parameter a exhibits a
plateau for x ≥ 5 (data not shown). Since the atomic
radius of Sb is larger than that of Ge, it is expected that
a increases with increasing Sb concentrations. As seen in
Figure 1(b), we observed that the thermal displacement
parameters, Uiso, for Pr atoms are large compared with
values of Pt or Ge/Sb atoms, which is a common feature
in ﬁlled-skutterudite systems. Figure 1(c) displays the
occupancies of the Pr and Pt crystallographic positions
and the relative ratios of Sb to Sb+Ge occupancies,
suggesting that the Pr sites are not fully occupied down
to ∼ 0.7 for x ≥ 3.5. A similar result is occasionally
observed in other ﬁlled skutterudite compounds [43,44].
This result is also consistent with the increase of
Pr-based impurity phases for samples with x ≥ 3.

Power-law ﬁts of ρ(T ) = ρ0 + AT 2 were performed up to 250
K2, indicated by the red solid lines. The dashed arrow indi-
cates the deviation from the ﬁt, possibly due to an impurity
phase. (b) Coeﬃcient A versus x. A scatters between 2 and
7 nΩ cm/K2 and increases rapidly for x ≥ 4. (c) The residual
resistivity, ρ0, from the ﬁts versus x is shown. ρ0 increases
rapidly from ∼2 to ∼216 µΩ cm, consistent with disorder
introduced by Sb substitution into PrPt4Ge12.

B. Electrical Resistivity

Electrical resistivity, ρ(T ), data taken in zero magnetic
ﬁeld are shown in Fig. 2. All concentrations of Sb dis-
play metallic behavior, as shown in Fig. 2(a). We show
only representative concentrations for visual clarity. The
residual resistivity ratio, RRR, versus x is presented in
Fig. 2(b); a semilogarithmic plot of (ρ300/ρ0) versus x,
where ρ300 is the room temperature resistivity and ρ0
is the resistivity value right above the superconducting
transitions, shows a rapid decrease with increasing x for
0 ≤ x ≤ 1, consistent with increased disorder produced
by the substitution of Sb for Ge in PrPt4Ge12. A gen-
eral trend of increasing residual resistivity ρ0 is observed
with increasing Sb concentration; however, there is some
scatter due to uncertainties in the measurement of the ge-
ometrical factors of the resistivity samples. Figure 2(c)
displays ρ(T ) normalized to its value at 10 K versus x. Tc
was deﬁned as the temperature where ρ(T )/ρ10 drops to
50% of its value (i.e., 0.5), and the width of the transition
was characterized by the temperatures where ρ(T )/ρ10
is 0.9 and 0.1. Even though the superconducting tran-
sitions are slightly broadened for x = 0.5, 1.5, and 2.5,
all transitions are still relatively sharp, indicating good
sample homogeneity or small amounts of impurity phases
in the samples. Tc is suppressed more rapidly with initial
Sb substitution with the eﬀect becoming weaker with in-
creasing x, similar to the behavior of the RRR versus x.
Superconductivity onsets are observed for x = 3.5 and 4
in measurements performed down to 140 mK.

centrations, with diﬀerent y-scales for visual clarity. The

bars are the transition widths, determined as described in
the text. Solid lines are ﬁts of the WHH theory to the data.
(b) Magnetic ﬁeld H - x phase diagram of PrPt4Ge12−xSbx at
T = 0 K. The solid line, which is a guide to the eye, represents
the rapid suppression of the 0 K value of the upper critical
ﬁeld, Hc2(0), with increasing x. The values of Hc2(0) were
determined from the WHH ﬁts in Fig. 4(a).

red solid lines represent least squares ﬁts to the data with
the formula ρ(T ) = ρ0 + AT 2 in the temperature range
c and 250 K2, suggesting Fermi-liquid behav-
between T 2
ior in PrPt4Ge12−xSbx for 0 ≤ x ≤ 5 [35]. Deviations
from the ﬁts were observed for the x = 4 and 5 samples,
which is probably due to the PtSb2 impurity phase. We
also performed a resistivity measurement on the samples
with x = 6, 7, and 12 (data not shown); these inho-
mogeneous samples exhibit the same feature marked by
arrows in Figs. 2 and 3 at the same temperature and
with the same character. For x = 6 and 7, the amount
of the PtSb2 phase is large; moreover, the x = 12 sample
turned out to be the compound PtSb2, with a very small
amount of PrPt4Ge7Sb5. The coeﬃcient, A, scatters be-
tween 2 to 7 nΩ cm/K2, increasing to 30 nΩ cm/K2 for
x ≥ 4. Figure 3(c) shows that values of the residual
resistivity ρ0 versus x, obtained from the ﬁts, increase
from ∼ 2 to 216 µΩ cm; though, the values of ρ0 ﬂuc-
tuate strongly with increasing x due to uncertainties in
the measurement of the geometrical factors of the resis-
tivity samples, as we mentioned previously to explain the
behavior seen in Fig. 2(a).

We also measured the upper critical ﬁelds, Hc2(T ), for
selected samples. In Fig. 4(a), the data points were de-
termined from the temperature where ρ(T ) decreases to
50% of its value in the normal state just above Tc at
ﬁxed magnetic ﬁelds, and the width of the transitions
was deﬁned using the 10% and 90% values of the drop in
ρ(T ). In general, the superconducting transitions become
broader at higher applied magnetic ﬁelds. The deriva-
tive (dHc2/dT )T =Tc was obtained by ﬁtting straight lines
to the data near Hc2 = 0 and estimated values are ∼
−0.39 T/K for all concentrations. Using the Werthamer-

PrPt4Ge12−xSbx with selected concentrations, measured in
applied magnetic ﬁelds of H = 0.5 T for the sample with x =

indicate upturns due to small amounts of paramagnetic im-
purities, as discussed in the text. The inset highlights the
Meissner eﬀect and diamagnetic shielding plotting 4πχ ver-
sus T for the x = 0 and 0.5 samples. (b) Alternating current
magnetic susceptibility χ′ and χ′′ versus temperature T for
x = 1, 1.5, and 2. (a), (b) Superconducting volume fractions
are close to 1. The deviations from unity are presumably due
to not accounting for the demagnetization factor.

Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) model [32,45], where Hc2(0)
is −0.693Tc(dHc2/T )T =Tc, the temperature dependence
of Hc2 was extracted, as shown in Fig. 4(a). Figure 4(b)
reveals a rapid decrease of Hc2(0) with increasing x,
showing similar behavior to those observed in the rapid
suppressions of Tc and the RRR with increasing x.
It
is noteworthy that the curvature of Hc2(T ) seems to de-
crease with increasing x, similar to the behavior previ-
ously observed in the Pr(Os1−xRux)4Sb12 system [46].

C. Magnetic Susceptibility

Magnetization divided by applied magnetic ﬁeld,
M/H, versus T data are displayed in Fig. 5(a). We
performed measurements under applied magnetic ﬁeld of
H = 0.5 T for the x = 0 sample and 1 T for the rest of
the samples containing Sb. The magnitude of M/H de-
creases with increasing x; however, an increase in magni-
tude and low-temperature upturns were observed for x ≥
4, which are expected from the XRD results. The de-
crease of the estimated Pr occupancy (see Fig. 1(c)) and
presence of ∼1 atomic percent of Pr and PtSb2 impurity
phases in x = 4 and 5 samples might be the reasons.
The inset of Fig. 5(a) shows superconducting transitions
for x = 0 and 0.5 under an applied magnetic ﬁeld H =
10 Oe. Tc was deﬁned by the point where zero-ﬁeld-
cooled (ZFC) and ﬁeld-cooled (FC) data deviated from
one another. The superconducting volume fractions were

estimated from the ZFC χ(T ) data by using the relation
4πχ × d, where d is the molar density of the samples
in units of mol/cm3. The superconducting samples with
x = 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 have volume fractions slightly
greater than 1, which results from exclusion of demagne-
tization factor corrections in this analysis; nevertheless,
these results oﬀer strong support for bulk superconduc-
tivity in the system PrPt4Ge12−xSbx.

We ﬁt the M/H versus T data in Fig. 5(a) to a Curie-

Weiss law in the temperature range from 75 to 300 K,

M/H = C0/(T − ΘCW),

(1)

where C0 is the Curie constant and ΘCW is the Curie-
Weiss temperature. The average eﬀective magnetic mo-
ment, µef f , of the Pr ion is extracted from the relation
C0 = µ2
ef f NA/3kB, where NA is Avogadro’s number
and kB is Boltzmann’s constant. The best ﬁt values are
shown in Fig. 6. Values of µef f scatter around 3.58µB,
the value for Pr3+ free ions, calculated using Hund’s
rules. The Curie-Weiss temperatures, ΘCW, are nearly
independent of x with a value of ∼ −10 K. Real and
imaginary components of the alternating current mag-
netic susceptibility, χ′ and χ′′, respectively, for the sam-
ples with x = 1, 1.5, and 2 are shown in Fig. 5(b). Clear
signatures of superconductivity were observed and Tc was
deﬁned as the temperatures where χ′′ drops sharply.

Isothermal magnetization measurements were also per-
formed at 2 K under applied magnetic ﬁelds up to 7 T
(data not shown). We observed a rapid suppression of
superconductivity below 1 T and above that, paramag-
netism was observed; however, slight curvatures in the
isothermal magnetization for the samples with x = 4 and
5 were seen, possibly due to small concentrations of para-
magnetic impurities, as we discussed in previous sections.
In order to roughly estimate the concentrations of para-
magnetic impurities, Gd was used as a standard impurity

this work has a large error bar since we included the Einstein
model; thus, the values obtained using other methods are also
presented for reference [26,35].

and assumed to be located at the Pr sites. This choice
was arbitrary; it could be other lanthanide ions on the
Pr site or 3d transition metal ions such as Fe on the Pt
site. The impurity concentration (N/V ) was determined
in two ways: Curie law ﬁts to the upturns at low tempera-
tures and the procedure described in reference [47], using
isothermal magnetization data. For the Curie law ﬁts,
eﬀ ), where µ2
we used the relation N/V = 3C0kB/(NAµ2
eﬀ
is the eﬀective magnetic moment of Gd ions (7.94 µB).
Both methods yielded estimates of the impurity concen-
tration of about 1 ∼ 2% of the lanthanide ions, consistent
with the results from XRD measurements. Since we have
evidence for larger amounts of impurities in the samples
with high Sb concentrations, we excluded other possibili-
ties for the upturn at low temperatures, such as a change
in the crystalline electric ﬁeld ground state of the Pr ions.

D. Speciﬁc Heat

Speciﬁc heat, C, versus T data are shown in Fig. 7(a).
The feature in C/T associated with superconductivity
was only observed in the x = 0 and 0.5 samples (the Tc
values for x ≥ 1 are at temperatures below the low tem-
perature limit of the PPMS DynaCool). Superconduct-

ing transition temperatures Tc were determined with the
aid of an idealized entropy-conserving constructions (not
shown). The resultant Tc values are consistent with the
values obtained from the ρ(T ) and χ(T ) measurements.
In order to analyze the behavior of the electronic and
phonon contributions to C, we ﬁrst attempted to em-
ploy linear ﬁts of C/T versus T 2 to the data, which is
a commonly-used method [35]. However, this method
is inappropriate for PrPt4Ge12−xSbx; the electronic spe-
ciﬁc heat coeﬃcient, γ′, becomes negative for x ≥ 4,
possibly due to low temperature upturns in the C/T ver-
sus T 2 plots (data not shown). The Debye temperature,
Θ′
D, extracted from the coeﬃcient β using the equation
C(T )/T = γ′ + βT 2, increases from ∼ 192 K to ∼ 271
K over the entire concentration range (data not shown).
Possible explanations will be addressed below in the dis-
cussion section.

Since we have evidence that the speciﬁc heat data need
to be analyzed using an alternative method, we consid-
ered contributions due to rattling motion of Pr ions or a
Pr nuclear Schottky. We reasoned that a nuclear Schot-
tky contribution is not reasonable since it could not fully
account for the continuous increase of the Debye tem-
perature, Θ′
D, for all x. We found that introducing an
Einstein contribution is more appropriate for the analysis
in this study. For example, the Einstein model accurately
describes the temperature dependence of the speciﬁc heat
of ﬁlled Tl0.22Co4Sb12 and unﬁlled Co4Sb12 skutterudite
compounds [48]. Also, the broad kink observed in the
C/T versus T 2 data for NdOs4Sb12 was explained by us-
ing a combination of Debye and Einstein models [49],
so there exists some precedent for including an Einstein
model in analysis of speciﬁc heat data.
If Pr ions be-
have as Einstein oscillators, the relationship between the
thermal displacement parameter, Uiso, and the Einstein
temperature, ΘE, is given by the expression:

Uiso =

2

2mPrkBΘE

coth(cid:18) ΘE

2T (cid:19) ,

(2)

where mPr is the mass of the Pr ion and kB is the Boltz-
man constant. For all x, estimated values of ΘE are
∼ 60 K, as shown in Fig. 7(b). Since there is support
for the possibility that Pr ions are behaving like Ein-
stein oscillators, the speciﬁc heat can be expressed as
C = γT + CEin(T ) + CDeb(T ) [49], where

CEin(T ) = r · 3R

(ΘE/T )2e(ΘE/T )
(e(ΘE/T ) − 1)2 ,

r is the mixing ratio of Pr ions, and R is the universal gas
constant. We assumed that only Pr ions are behaving
like Einstein oscillators in this analysis; thus, the mix-
ing ratio is constrained to be r ≤ 1. The least-squares
ﬁts of γT + CEin(T ) + CDeb(T ) to the C(T ) data were

performed in the temperature range between 1.8 and 30
K and corresponding best-ﬁt values for γ, ΘE, and ΘD
were extracted. As shown in Fig. 7(b), ΘE scatters in
the range of ∼ 60 to 65 K, indicating a consistent result
with the values from the XRD analysis using Eq. (2).
The ΘD versus x plot in Fig. 7(c) exhibits a relatively
modest increase of ΘD with x compared to the analysis
of C(T )/T = γ′ + βT 2 ﬁts to the speciﬁc data. The elec-
tronic speciﬁc heat coeﬃcient γ, presented in Fig. 7(d),
ﬁrst decreases from ∼ 107 at x = 0 to ∼ 1 mJ/mol K2
at x = 3, and then increases to ∼ 180 mJ/mol K2 for
x ≥ 4. Both ΘD and γ values for x = 0 are larger than
previously reported values, γ′, of 48 and 87 mJ/mol K2,
respectively [26,35]; however, this is expected due to the
diﬀerent methods used to extract the ΘD and γ values.
The electronic contribution to the speciﬁc heat, Ce(T ),
was extracted by subtracting the phonon contribution,
Cph(T ) = CEin(T ) + CDeb(T ), from the C(T ) data. Fig-
ure 8 displays semilogarithmic plots of Ce/γTc versus
Tc/T for PrPt4Ge12 and PrPt4Ge11.5Sb0.5. The ﬁts to
the data were performed in the range 1 ≤ Tc/T ≤ 2.5.
The red line in Fig. 8(a) demonstrates that PrPt4Ge12 is
well described by b(Tc/T )n, where n ∼ −2.5, suggesting
multiband superconductivity or nodes in the gap func-
tion in this compound [28]. The ﬁt values for b and n are
slightly diﬀerent from the previous report [35], because
diﬀerent phonon contributions to the speciﬁc heat were
subtracted. Figure 8(b) shows that the sample with x =
0.5 can be ﬁt by an exponential temperature dependence,
ae−∆/Tc, where a is a ﬁtting parameter and ∆ is the su-
perconducting energy gap. The coeﬃcient a is around 5.3
and ∆/Tc is ∼1.3, which is somewhat smaller than the
value of 1.76 from the BCS prediction of weak-coupled
superconductivity. This change from power law to expo-
nential temperature dependence is similar to behaviors

observed in previous reports for the Pr(Os1−xRux)4Sb12
and Pr1−xCexPt4Ge12 systems [35,50] and could be ex-
plained by a crossover in the structure of the supercon-
ducting energy gap from one containing point-nodes to
one that is nodeless, or a suppression of one or more
superconducting energy gaps in a multiband supercon-
ductor [28,33,34,51].

IV. DISCUSSION

Figure 9 summarizes results from ρ(T ), χ(T ), χ′′(T ),
and C(T ) measurements in a phase diagram of supercon-
ducting transition temperature Tc versus nominal anti-
mony concentration x. The Tc values were taken from
the onset of diamagnetic signals for the χ′′(T ) and χ(T )
measurements. For the C(T ) measurements, Tc was de-
termined from the results of idealized entropy-conserving
constructions [52,53] (data not shown). This suppression
of Tc with x is also consistent with the decrease of the
upper critical ﬁeld as shown in Fig. 4(b).

In order to understand the suppression of supercon-
ductivity, we need to consider the eﬀects of Sb substi-
tution in this system, including the increase of disor-
der, the increase in unit-cell volume, and the increase
in electron concentration (electron doping). It has been
reported that in Pt-Ge based skutterudite compounds,

7

a large density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level is a
common feature, and it is believed to facilitate supercon-
ductivity [24,26]. Moreover, soft x-ray valence-band pho-
toemission spectroscopy on PrPt4Ge12 and LaPt4Ge12
display almost identical spectra, indicating that the elec-
tronic structures for both systems are very similar with
one another [54]. Both have a similar Tc near 8 K and ex-
hibit evidence for multiband superconductivity; however,
PrPt4Ge12 shows time-reversal symmetry breaking of the
superconducting state [31]. Therefore, a comparison of
the suppression of superconductivity and the eﬀect of Sb
substitution on these two diﬀerent systems, LaPt4Ge12
and PrPt4Ge12, may provide new insights. Our careful
comparison reveals that there are several similarities and
one signiﬁcant diﬀerence [40]. The increase in disorder
results in a rapid decrease of RRR (see Fig. 2), indicating
a correlation between disorder and the suppression of su-
perconductivity for low x concentrations, consistent with
the result in LaPt4Ge12−xSbx. The unit-cell volume of
superconducting Pt-Ge based skutterudites seems to be
uncorrelated or very weakly correlated to their supercon-
ducting states, because the changes of Tc upon applied
pressure are small or non-monotonic; Tc is probably more
dependent on the electronic structure [55,56]. Humer et
al. discussed the decrease of the DOS and γ values with
Sb substitution, and its role in facilitating a rapid sup-
pression of superconductivity [40]; a very similar decrease
of γ values for samples in the range 0 ≤ x ≤ 3 is observed
in this study .

The response of superconductivity to Sb substitution
observed in this study contrasts with what was reported
for LaPt4Ge12−xSbx. Even though there were no sam-
ples with Sb concentrations between x = 0.5 and 3 in the
LaPt4Ge12−xSbx study, no evidence of superconductivity
was observed at x = 3 down to 0.4 K; moreover, a ﬁrst
principles calculation predicts that the system moves to-
ward a metal-to insulator transition with higher Sb con-
centration. With these facts in mind, we conjecture that
the suppression of superconductivity in LaPt4Ge12−xSbx
with x could be faster than and/or diﬀerent from that
of PrPt4Ge12−xSbx, as indicated by the red dashed line
in Fig. 9. Similarly, a diﬀerent suppression rate of Tc
is observed upon substitution of Ce ions into the La
and Pr sites [57]. The observed diﬀerences in the sup-
pression of Tc, therefore, could be explained by diﬀering
pairing mechanisms in these two systems; PrPt4Ge12 ex-
hibits an unconventional type of superconductivity, while
LaPt4Ge12 is a conventional BCS-type superconductor.
However, there is evidence that PrPt4Ge12 has multiple
isotropic BCS-type energy gaps, which cannot be ruled
out from this study [32–34]. Also, the expected behav-
ior associated with point nodes in speciﬁc heat measure-
ments on polycrystalline samples is not supported by the
results from a single crystal study: Polycrystalline speci-
mens show a T 3 temperature dependence of the electronic
speciﬁc heat, which has been attributed to a possible nu-
clear Schottky anomaly arising from Pr-containing sur-
face contamination [34].

A rattling mode of the rare-earth ion has been observed
in several ﬁlled-skutterudite compounds [58,59], espe-
cially in the ROs4Sb12 (R = rare earth) family [60–62].
On the other hand, the Pt-Ge based skutterudites exhibit
no strong evidence for oﬀ-center displacements of ﬁller
ions; thus, the DOS, composed of Ge-p and Pt-5d states,
has more signiﬁcant eﬀects on various phenomena [30].
However, the introduction of Gd ions into the La site in
LaPt4Ge12 provides an extra phonon mode with ΘE ∼
24 K [63].
In this work, a weak “rattling” mode with
a value of ΘE ∼ 60 K was estimated. In analogy with
the behavior of Gd ions, the introduction of Sb ions into
the Pt-Ge cage might produce additional phonon modes.
The value of ΘE stays roughly constant throughout the
entire range of x, suggesting that the rattling motion is
independent of x; rattling in the PrPt4Ge12−xSbx sys-
tems does not seem to have signiﬁcant eﬀects on either
the superconducting state nor the localized Pr+3 elec-
tronic conﬁguration, consistent with the x-independent
behavior of µef f /µB as seen in Fig. 6(a).

We are currently unable to deﬁnitively address the re-
lationships among the Pr site occupancy, rattling dynam-
ics, and the observed enhancement of electronic correla-
tions for x ≥ 4 samples. It has been reported that the
partial ﬁlling of the Pr sites does not have a signiﬁcant ef-
fect on the superconducting properties of PrPt4Ge12 [64].
A Pr Schottky anomaly could make it diﬃcult to properly
analyze the speciﬁc heat data [34], possibly leading to an
artiﬁcial enhancement of γ. The presence of small con-
centrations of impurities could also potentially be respon-
sible for an anomalous enhancement of the speciﬁc heat
at low temperature for higher x (see Fig. 7(a)). All of
these factors complicate our ability to clearly determine
the phenomena or phase that occurs in the gradient-ﬁlled
region for x ≥ 4 in Fig. 9. In order to have a better un-
derstanding of not only the features in the properties of
samples with high Sb concentrations, but also the nature
of superconductivity in PrPt4Ge12, future research such
as neutron scattering, ultrasonic, or NMR-NQR measure-
ments on high-quality single crystalline specimens will be

necessary.

V. CONCLUDING REMARKS

We have studied the superconducting and normal-
state properties of PrPt4Ge12-based pseudoternary com-
pounds in which Sb has been substituted for Ge. Poly-
crystalline samples of PrPt4Ge12−xSbx with Sb concen-
trations up to x = 5 were investigated via x-ray diﬀrac-
tion, electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and
speciﬁc heat measurements. We observed a suppression
of superconductivity with increasing Sb substitution up
to x = 4, above which, no signature of superconductivity
was observed down to 140 mK. The electronic coeﬃcient
of speciﬁc heat γ decreases with increasing Sb concentra-
tion in the superconducting region, indicating that the
density of states might be an important parameter that
facilitates superconductivity. The speciﬁc heat data for
x = 0.5 exhibits an exponential temperature dependence
in the superconducting state, suggesting a nodeless su-
perconducting energy gap. A constant “rattling” mode
of Pr ions with a value of ΘE ∼ 60 K across the entire sub-
stitution range was suggested by Rietveld reﬁnements of
XRD data and ﬁts of the Einstein model to speciﬁc heat
data; however, it does not seem to be correlated with
superconductivity in this system.
