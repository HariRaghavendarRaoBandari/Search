Abstract

Narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s) are active galactic nuclei (AGN) recently identiﬁed as a
new class of γ-ray sources. The high energy emission is explained by the presence of a relativistic
jet observed at small angles, just like in the case of blazars. When the latter are observed at larger
angles they appear as radio-galaxies, but an analogue parent population for beamed NLS1s has
not yet been determined. In this work we analyze this problem by studying the physical properties
of three diﬀerent samples of parent sources candidates: steep-spectrum radio-loud NLS1s, radio-
quiet NLS1s, and disk-hosted radio-galaxies, along with compact steep-spectrum sources. In our
approach, we ﬁrst derived black hole mass and Eddington ratio from the optical spectra, then we
investigated the interaction between the jet and the narrow-line region from the [O III] λλ4959,5007
lines. Finally, the radio luminosity function allowed us to compare their jet luminosity and hence
determine the relations between the samples.

Introduction

One of the most intriguing classes in the vast zoology of active galactic nuclei (AGN) are narrow-line
Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s). First classiﬁed by Osterbrock & Pogge (1985), they exhibit a low full
width at half maximum (FWHM) of Hβ (by deﬁnition below 2000 km s−1), and a ratio [O III]/Hβ <
3. Such characteristics, along with the high Eddington ratio [9], are often interpreted as consequences
of the presence of a relatively low mass black hole (106-108 M⊙) accreting fast. One explanation for
the low black hole mass is the young age of these objects [27]. Another possibility is that the broad-line
region (BLR) of these sources is disk-like shaped [12]. In this case, NLS1s would be AGN observed
pole-on, in which the Doppler broadening due to the rotation is not visible and the permitted lines
appear to be narrow.

NLS1s drew new attention with the discovery of γ-ray emission from a few of them with the
Fermi Satellite [1]. This high-energy emission is typically detected in radio-loud sources with ﬂat
radio-spectra and high brightness temperatures [37], which reveal that these objects likely harbor a
relativistic jet pointed toward the Earth. NLS1s then became the third class of AGN with a beamed

jet, along with BL Lacs and ﬂat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). According to the uniﬁed model,
the misaligned counterparts, also known as the parent population, of BL Lacs and FSRQs are radio-
galaxies [36]. For beamed NLS1s, whose properties were extensively investigated by [17], the nature
of such population is still uncertain. In this work we will present a review of the researches published
in recent papers by Berton et al. [5, 6, 7], in which this parent population problem was investigated
in several aspects.

A ﬁrst hypothesis regarding parent sources was suggested in [16]. A ﬂat-spectrum radio-loud NLS1
(F-NLS1), observed under a diﬀerent inclination, appears as a steep-spectrum radio-loud NLS1 (S-
NLS1) with jets viewed at large angles. Such sources exist, but they are quite rare. In the complete
sample of [37], out of 23 radio-loud NLS1s (RLNLS1s) 12 have a ﬂat-spectrum and only 7 have
a measured steep-spectrum. For geometrical reasons, the theoretical number of misaligned sources
should be 2Γ2 times the number of beamed objects, where Γ is the bulk Lorentz factor. For a typical
value of Γ ∼ 10 [2], the 12 beamed sources in [37] should correspond to ∼2400 misaligned objects but,
as mentioned before, only 7 can be found in the sample. It is clear from these numbers that something
is missing.

It is possible that this lack of sources is due to a selection eﬀect. Beamed sources are more
luminous because of relativistic eﬀects, and therefore visible at larger distances. But it is also possible
that misaligned F-NLS1s appear as completely diﬀerent sources, and hence are not easily recognizable
as such [16]. If, for instance, NLS1s are young, it is possible that they have not developed radio lobes
yet, and that only a strongly collimated jet is present. If this is the case, at large inclination the diﬀuse
emission coming from the jet would be weak and virtually undetectable, making the source appear as
a radio-quiet NLS1 (RQNLS1). Conversely, if NLS1s are AGN observed pole-on with a ﬂattened BLR,
a diﬀerent angle would increase the Doppler broadening, and the source would appear as a broad-line
radio-galaxy (or narrow-line radio-galaxy when the line of sight intercepts the molecular torus). As
NLS1s often hosted in disk galaxies [11], parent sources should share the same property. A suitable
candidate would then be a disk-hosted radio-galaxy.

Finally, another option must be kept on the table. Many authors have suggested a link between
NLS1s and compact steep-spectrum objects (CSS, e.g. [30, 25, 37, 10, 21]). The latter are also often
considered young radio-galaxies with the jets still conﬁned within the host-galaxy and radio-lobes
developed only on a small scale [15], and RLNLS1s are reminescent of them in several respects [21]. For
this reason, it is possible that misaligned F-NLS1s can be identiﬁed with CSS, and in particular with
those having a high-excitation spectrum (CSS/HERG). To understand which of these hypotheses is
correct, we investigated the physical properties of four samples of candidates approaching this problem
with diﬀerent methods.

2 Methods

2.1 Black hole mass

To derive this physical property along with the Eddington ratio, we analyzed the optical spectra,
obtained from the SDSS or with the Asiago Astrophysical Observatory. We derived the mass under
the assumption of virialized system, deriving in type 1 AGN the second-order moment σ of the Hβ
line, since σ is relatively insensitive to inclination eﬀects and BLR geometry [33], and therefore it is
particularly helpful in our case. For type 2 AGN, we instead used as a proxy the width of the [O III]
core component. The latter is connected to the stellar velocity dispersion [29] and, as a consequence,
to the black hole mass. In both cases, the use of lines instead of the continuum partially avoids con-
tamination from the jet synchrotron emission, and should provide a less biased estimate of black hole
mass. To derive ﬁnally the bolometric luminosity, and hence the Eddington ratio, we measured the
line luminosities, focusing again on Hβ and [O III], which are both directly connected with the AGN
luminosity [20].

2.2 Lines decomposition

We studied the [O III] lines proﬁles in 124 NLS1s, 68 radio-quiet and 56 radio-loud. The ﬁrst sam-
ple was derived from SDSS DR7, the second was a collection of all known RLNLS1s with a suitable
optical spectrum. A typical [O III] lines proﬁle can be decomposed in two components. The ﬁrst one
represents the line core, which is usually associated with gas moving far away from the nucleus, whose
motion is dominated only by the gravitational potential of the bulge. The second one is a blue wing,
thought to be originated in outﬂows moving in the inner narrow-line region (NLR), possibly generated
by the strong radiation pressure coming from the accretion disk, or via interaction with a relativistic
jet [26]. We decomposed each [O III] line using two Gaussians. The ﬁtting was performed by means
of an automatic procedure, and the errors estimation on each parameter via Monte-Carlo method.

2.3 Luminosity function

The luminosity function (LF) is the volumetric density of sources as a function of their luminosity.
Complete samples are required to compute it. We used this technique on the only two complete
samples available in literature of F-NLS1s and CSS/HERGs, and on a control sample of FSRQs. The
method we used was the same described in [35, 31]. For each source, we evaluated the maximum
volume at which it could be detected, Vmax, testing then the evolution of the samples with a V/Vmax
test. Then we derived the LF at 1.4 GHz by dividing the samples in luminosity bins. We later used the
model of relativistic beaming described in [35]. This technique allowed us to add relativistic beaming
to the parent candidate sample, comparing then the resulting model with the LF obtained for the
beamed sample, and testing the uniﬁcation of the two populations on a statistical basis.

3 Steep-spectrum radio-loud NLS1s

In the ﬁrst parent sample, S-NLS1s, we studied the black hole mass and Eddington ratio distributions.
The values we found are in good agreement with several works already published in the literature.
S-NLS1s have masses between 106-108.5 M⊙. Such values are quite close to those found among F-
NLS1s which, according to [17], are between 106.5-108.5 M⊙. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (K-S)
we performed seems to point out that these two mass distributions might be drawn from the same
population. This result is particularly robust when statistically complete subsamples of sources are
considered. For the Eddington ratio distibutions the result does not change, with typical values
between 0.01 and 1 in both samples. This indicates that S-NLS1s are very likely misaligned F-NLS1s,
in analogy with what happens for blazars and radio-galaxies. At large inclinations, the radio-lobes
extended emission starts to dominate over that of the core, making the radio-spectrum steeper. These
sources cannot anyway represent the entire parent population, since this sample by construction does
not include obscured parent candidates (type 2 AGN).

4 Disk-hosted radio-galaxies

If this is not
Disk RGs can be type 1 parent sources only if the BLR has a ﬂattened geometry.
the case, a large FWHM in the permitted lines is indeed an indication of high black hole mass, not
compatible with that of NLS1s. Obscured RLNLS1s instead are more likely to appear as narrow-line
radio-galaxies hosted in a disk galaxy.
In our work, we analyzed the black hole mass distribution
of these sources, ﬁnding that disk-hosted RGs black holes span a large range of masses. This class
of AGN appears to be similar to a bridge connecting the low-mass/high-Eddington sources, such as
NLS1s, with high-mass/low-Eddington objects, such as elliptical radio-galaxies. Our ﬁnding is that
those sources with low black hole mass and high Eddington ratio are suitable parent candidates, and
that disk RGs with a pseudobulge can be even better candidates as F-NLS1s parent sources.

Our sample included a few type 1 AGN, which have FHWM larger than 2000 km s−1, but black
hole masses that overlap with the F-NLS1s distribution. Our method is relatively insensitive to BLR
geometry, so the higher FWHM of these sources and the similar black hole mass might be a hint of a
ﬂattened component in the BLR. It is ﬁnally worth noting that two of these disk-hosted radio-galaxies
are the only γ-ray emitters included in our samples. They are 3C 120, hosted in a disk galaxy [23]
and detected by [3], and IC 310, hosted in a lenticular galaxy [32] and identiﬁed as a TeV emitter by
[24]. Both these sources are included in the 3rd Fermi catalog of γ-ray emitting AGN [4].

5 Radio-quiet NLS1s

The black hole mass analysis on RQNLS1s did not provide a clear result. Their distribution is slightly
diﬀerent with respect to that of F-NLS1s, with values between 105.5-108.5 M⊙ and on average a
lower mass. Conversely the Eddington ratio distribution is close to that of F-NLS1s. Therefore we
investigated these sources also by means of their [O III] lines proﬁle, trying to compare the dynamics
of their NLR to that of RLNLS1s (both steep- and ﬂat-spectrum). Our result was that the NLR of
RLNLS1s typically shows stronger signs of perturbation, likely due to interaction with a relativistic jet.
In particular, we found that the [O III] lines in RLNLS1s often show a large blueshift, corresponding to
velocities higher than 150 km s−1. This feature likely indicates a bulk outﬂowing motion of the NLR
in these sources [26]. This behavior is observed also among RQNLS1s, but the number of such blue
outliers is much less frequent, as conﬁrmed by the Anderson-Darling statistical test we performed. The
interpretation we gave for these results is that in RLNLS1s a fully developed, perhaps intermittent,
relativistic jet is moving through the medium and interacting with it. In RQNLS1s, however, only
a jet-base [14] or an aborted jet [18] is present, originating weak non-thermal emission in the core
[19] and a strong wind which, despite being able to induce turbulence in the NLR, has not the same
eﬃciency as the relativistic jet. Therefore the vast majority of RQNLS1s are probably not part of the
parent population, though few exceptions are present (e.g. Mrk 1239 [13]). The latter are anyway
likely due to the diﬃcult measurement of the radio-loudness for nearby sources. Radio-loudness in
fact is strongly aﬀected by the way in which the optical and radio ﬂuxes are evaluated. In particular,
some sources can move from the radio-quiet to the radio-loud domain when in the optical ﬂux only
the nuclear component is considered [22].

6 Compact steep-spectrum sources

To understand whether CSS, particularly those classiﬁed as HERG, are part of the parent population,
we investigated again their black hole mass and Eddington ratio distribution. In this case we found
a nearly perfect agreement between this class of sources and F-NLS1s, both in mass and in accretion
luminosity. The K-S test indeed suggested that the two distributions are very likely originated by the
same population. To get further conﬁrmation of such result, we investigated CSS by means of the radio
LF at 1.4 GHz. After computing it, as mentioned before we added a model of relativistic beaming
to the parent candidate LF, and compared the result with the observed LF of F-NLS1s. We found
that, using reasonable beaming parameters, such as bulk Lorentz factor Γ = 10 and ratio between jet
luminosity and unbeamed luminosity f = 0.5, CSS/HERGs represent a very good candidate as parent
population, at least in a statistical sense. It is worth noting that this does not contradict the previous
conclusions on the parent sources. Both S-NLS1s and disk RGs are indeed probably connected with
CSS/HERGs. As pointed out by several authors (see for instance the recent works by [10] and [21])
S-NLS1s often show a radio morphology which is consistent with that of CSS. Moreover other studies
(e.g. [28, 8]) showed that CSS/HERGs might be hosted in disk galaxies, therefore CSS/HERGs might
be part of the the disk RGs class. Finally, the LFs seem also to point out a possible evolutionary
scenario in which F-NLS1s and CSS/HERGs are the young and still growing version of FSRQs and
Fanaroﬀ-Riley radio-galaxies with high-excitation spectrum, respectively [7].

7 Conclusions

All the results we have previously summarized seem to unveil a new uniﬁed model of young AGN.
This investigation led us to understand that, when observed at larger angles, F-NLS1s can appear as
CSS objects with high-excitation spectra. Both S-NLS1s and disk RGs can be, with some caveats,
considered as sources related to CSS/HERGs. Therefore the following picture seems to come to light.
A beamed NLS1, when observed at larger angles without obscuration, appears as a S-NLS1, and can be
classiﬁed as a CSS according to its radio morphology and young age. When the line of sight intercepts
the molecular torus, the source appears as a disk-hosted narrow-line radio-galaxy, again with a CSS
morphology. The incidence of the BLR geometry on this model is still unclear. More detailed studies
on larger samples are then required to better address this problem, which might also reveal in turn
very interesting information on the evolution of AGN through cosmic time.
