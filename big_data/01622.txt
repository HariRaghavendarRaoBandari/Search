ABSTRACT

We present a sample of accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in low-mass galaxies at z < 1.
We identify dwarf galaxies in the NEWFIRM Medium Band Survey with stellar masses M(cid:63) < 3 ×
109M(cid:12) that have spectroscopic redshifts from the DEEP2 survey and lie within the region covered
by deep (> 200 ks) archival Chandra X-ray data. From our sample of ∼ 600 low-mass galaxies,
10 exhibit X-ray emission consistent with that arising from AGN activity. If black hole mass scales
roughly with stellar mass, then we expect that these AGN are powered by SMBHs with masses
of ∼ 105 − 106 M(cid:12) and typical Eddington ratios ∼ 5%. Furthermore, we ﬁnd an active fraction
consistent with extrapolations of other searches of ∼ 0.006 − 3% for 109 M(cid:12) ≤ M(cid:63) ≤ 3 × 109 M(cid:12)
and 0.1 < z < 0.6. This is the ﬁrst time an active fraction has been directly measured outside of
the local universe for these SMBH mass ranges. We ﬁnd good agreement with semi-analytic models,
suggesting that as we search larger volumes we may use comparisons between observed active fractions
and models to understand seeding mechanisms in the early universe.

1. INTRODUCTION

Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are ubiquitous in
massive, bulge-dominated galaxies (e.g. Kauﬀmann et al.
2003a), and the masses of these black holes have been
found to correlate with the properties of the stellar
spheroid (e.g., the galaxies’ stellar velocity dispersion,
MBH − σ(cid:63); e.g., McConnell et al. 2012; Kormendy &
Ho 2013). These relationships suggest that a full un-
derstanding of galaxy evolution requires knowledge of
SMBH formation and evolution. Unfortunately, there is
very little known about SMBH formation and detecting
the ﬁrst SMBHs directly is practically impossible with
the tools currently available.

Low-mass SMBHs in dwarf galaxies, which are ex-
pected to have had little growth through mergers or ac-
cretion, can provide an indirect window to the primordial
seed of the SMBHs in more massive galaxies we see to-
day (Bellovary et al. 2011). Therefore, the distribution
of central black hole masses in dwarf galaxies can give
us many insights into SMBH and galaxy evolution (see
reviews in Volonteri 2010; Greene 2012).

It is unclear whether all low-mass, bulgeless galaxies
harbor massive black holes. From dynamical measure-
ments, it is believed that M33 must have a supermas-
sive black hole no larger than 1500 M(cid:12), if it has one
at all (Gebhardt et al. 2001). Likewise, any black hole
in NGC 205 must be less than 3.8 × 104 M(cid:12) (Valluri
et al. 2005). On the other hand, there is dynamical ev-
idence for SMBHs in some nearby dwarf galaxies, such

as NGC404 and NGC 4395, which appear to host black
holes with masses ∼ 105 M(cid:12) (see, for example, Filip-
penko & Sargent 1989; Seth et al. 2010; Thornton et al.
2008; den Brok et al. 2015). In order to understand the
connection between SMBHs and dwarf galaxies, we need
a large, representative sample of dwarf galaxies with cen-
tral SMBHs.

With current technology, direct dynamical measure-
ments of < 105 M(cid:12) black holes cannot extend beyond a
few Mpc. On the other hand, accreting SMBHs, known
as active galactic nuclei (AGN), can be identiﬁed up to
very large redshifts. The ﬁrst attempts to search for a
large sample of AGN in dwarf galaxies used broad and/or
narrow optical emission lines to ﬁnd AGN (e.g. Greene
& Ho 2004, 2007; Reines et al. 2013; Moran et al. 2014).
However, optical data is inherently limited by dust ob-
scuration and emission from star formation (Goulding
& Alexander 2009). Both mid-IR (Satyapal et al. 2008,
2009) and radio (Reines et al. 2011, 2014) searches have
yielded complementary samples for follow-up (Whalen
et al. 2015; Reines & Deller 2012).
In this paper, we
focus on X-rays, which are insensitive to dust and pro-
vide a relatively clean tool for identifying accreting black
holes (e.g., Brandt & Alexander 2015). Searches of local
dwarf galaxies in the X-ray have also yielded interest-
ing targets (Desroches & Ho 2009; Schramm et al. 2013;
Lemons et al. 2015). Miller et al. (2015) used a uniform
survey of red galaxies within 30 Mpc to constrain the
distribution of black hole masses in dwarf galaxies, but
were fundamentally limited by their very small volume.
In order to ﬁnd the best estimate of the occupation
fraction in dwarf galaxies, larger survey volumes must

2

be used, which implies we must push to higher redshifts.
Recent deep surveys now allow us to complete this type
of search up to z ∼ 1. X-ray stacking has been used to
search for dwarf galaxies up to z < 1.5 (Mezcua et al.
2016), but using the technique of looking for X-ray point
sources that correspond to dwarf galaxies beyond z ∼ 0.4
has not yet been attempted. This type of search requires
deep X-ray data, as well as accurate galaxy masses in the
same region.
We have performed a search for SMBHs in dwarf galax-
ies up to redshift z (cid:46) 1 in order to shed light on SMBH
and galaxy evolution. In this paper, we outline our search
for SMBHs in dwarf galaxies identiﬁed using a combina-
tion of NEWFIRM Medium-Band Survey (NMBS), Hub-
ble Space Telescope (HST ), Chandra X-ray Observatory,
& DEEP2 observations.
In Section 2, we outline our
source selection process. We begin by identifying dwarf
galaxies (M(cid:63) < 3 × 109 M(cid:12)) with DEEP2 spectroscopic
redshifts z < 1 in the AEGIS ﬁeld using the NEWFIRM
Medium-Band Survey. We then analyze these sources us-
ing Chandra X-ray Observatory Archival data. Section 3
details the results of our search, while Section 4 discusses
the Eddington and AGN fractions that we measure and
how these results compare to other studies and simula-
tions. Section 5 is a summary. Throughout, we assume
the standard, ﬂat ΛCDM cosmology with parameters:
H0 = 68 km s

−1 Mpc−1 and Ωm = 0.3.

2. DATA & SOURCE SELECTION

Our goal is to select dwarf galaxies (M(cid:63) ≤ 3× 109 M(cid:12))
that may harbor central supermassive black holes. For
this, we require deep X-ray data and complementary
multi-wavelength data that can provide estimates of the
galaxy properties. In addition, it is important to have
deep, homogenous spectroscopic redshifts and high spa-
tial resolution imaging. The All-Wavelength Extended
Groth Strip International Survey (AEGIS) ﬁeld has deep
X-ray data (∼ 200 − 800 ks) while still providing suﬃ-
cient volume for statistically signiﬁcant source numbers
and excellent multi-wavelength data. The AEGIS ﬁeld is
centered at α = 14h17m, δ = +52◦30m (J2000), and cov-
ers an area of ∼ 0.9 deg2 (Davis et al. 2002; Davis et al.
2007). The requirement of data from the NMBS, HST
and Chandra within the AEGIS ﬁeld yields a contiguous
overlapping footprint of ∼ 0.1 deg2 (see Figure 1). We
select galaxies within this region as described below.

2.1. A Dwarf Galaxy Sample with Robust Stellar Mass

Measurements

For reliable stellar masses, we turn to the NEWFIRM
Medium-Band Survey (NMBS; see Whitaker et al. 2011,
for a complete description), which is a near-infrared
imaging survey of part of the AEGIS ﬁeld. Since this
survey splits the broad-band JHK bands into 7 medium-
band ﬁlters, there is improved modeling of the spec-
tral energy distribution, which leads to more depend-
able stellar masses (van van Dokkum et al. 2009). The
27(cid:48).6 × 27(cid:48).6 NMBS survey region is centered at α =
14h18m00s, δ = +52◦36m07s (J2000) (van van Dokkum
et al. 2009). The K-band 90% limiting magnitude is
22.5 AB mag and the 50% limiting magnitude is 23.6 AB
mag (Whitaker et al. 2011). The NMBS sources were K-
band selected using SExtractor (Bertin & Arnouts 1996),

Fig. 1.— Survey region with galaxies selected from the NEW-
FIRM Medium-Band Survey (NMBS) indicated. The black line
outlines the Chandra X-ray Observatory AEGIS observations. The
blue line corresponds to the Hubble Space Telescope observations,
and the yellow line shows the region covered by the NMBS. The red
circles indicate the positions of the low-mass (M(cid:63) < 3 × 109M(cid:12))
galaxies with DEEP2 spectroscopic redshifts z < 1 selected from
the NMBS.

Fig. 2.— Mass as a function of redshift, with mass and redshift
histograms for the low-mass galaxies selected from NMBS. The
black points and lines indicate all low-mass galaxies selected from
NMBS, with the histograms normalized to 10% of their actual val-
ues to enable better comparison with the ≥ 2σ X-ray sources. The
red circles and red dotted lines indicate our ≥ 2σ X-ray sources.
The blue circles signify our ≥ 3σ X-ray sources.

and the stellar population parameters, including star for-
mation rates, were derived with FAST (Kriek et al. 2009)
using the Bruzual & Charlot (2003) models. To ensure
more accurate stellar masses, the NMBS used spectro-
scopic redshifts from the DEEP2 survey, which has a

limit of R < 24.1, (Davis et al. 2002; Steidel et al. 2003)
when available. For our purposes, accurate stellar masses
are paramount, hence we restrict ourselves to the sources
with spectroscopic redshifts. In addition, we restrict the
galaxies to those with zspec < 1 due to the limited depth
of the NMBS for such low masses. Of the 27652 sources
identiﬁed by the NMBS, we ﬁnd 642 within our mass and
redshift ranges that have spectroscopic redshift measure-
ments.

To ensure that all of our sources are low-mass galax-
ies rather than tidal tails or point sources mistakenly
identiﬁed by the NMBS, we require morphologies of our
sources. HST surveyed a 0.197 deg2 region of the AEGIS
ﬁeld using the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS)
(Davis et al. 2007). Using the HST data, we discard
43 of the galaxies within our mass and redshift ranges
because they are point sources or mergers. We exclude
these mergers because of the possibility of inaccurate
mass measurements. This leaves us with 599 sources se-
lected from the NMBS and HST data.
The 599 galaxies selected are shown, binned by mass
and redshift, in Figure 2. The masses range from ∼ 5 ×
107 M(cid:12) to 3 × 109 M(cid:12). The star formation rates (SFR)
vary from ∼ 3×10−4 to 10 M(cid:12) yr−1, with a median SFR
= 0.24 M(cid:12) yr−1.

2.2. X-ray Analysis

We now identify the dwarf galaxies from our sample
that show signiﬁcant X-ray emission by using the avail-
able X-ray data within the AEGIS ﬁeld. The Chandra
X-ray Observatory has observed ∼ 0.7 deg2 of AEGIS
with the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS)
as part of XDEEP2 (Goulding et al. 2012, see also Nan-
dra et al. 2005; Laird et al. 2009; Nandra et al. 2015).
To ensure the most reliable measurements, we apply the
latest calibration ﬁles using the CIAO software (version
4.7) and CALDB 4.6.5 (Fruscione et al. 2006).

Our X-ray analysis consists of performing forced aper-
ture photometry at the optical positions of our selected
galaxies. Some of our selected galaxies have X-ray data
from diﬀerent, overlapping subregions within AEGIS.
However, we only use the X-ray data from the region with
an aim-point closest to each source. This is because we
wish to limit the amount of contamination from diﬀuse
emission, and the Chandra psf deteriorates with distance
from the aim-point. We deﬁne the X-ray source region as
the 90% enclosed energy radius around the optical source
position using the CIAO psf module. This is done for
the soft band (SB; 0.5−2 keV), the hard band (HB; 2−7
keV), and the full band (FB; 0.5 − 7 keV). The 90% en-
closed energy radii range from ∼ 1(cid:48)(cid:48) − 15(cid:48)(cid:48) for most of
our sources. We deﬁne the background region to be a
square with sides that are at least four times as large as
the radius of the source region. We ﬁnd that 18 of the
599 low-mass galaxies selected from NMBS have a sec-
ond spatially coincident galaxy within the 90% enclosed
energy radius. The X-ray photons associated with these
neighbors cannot be reliably disentangled from the tar-
get low-mass galaxy, and thus these sources are discarded
from the sample.

Note that our method here diﬀers from that of tra-
ditional X-ray catalogs created independently of multi-
wavelength source positions. Using X-ray data alone to

3

detect a source necessitates a high cut in X-ray signal-
to-noise. However, our forced photometry method allows
us to identify X-ray sources that may fall below the typi-
cal signiﬁcance level cut and helps to mitigate the eﬀects
of Eddington bias. Since we already know that there
is an optical source at a given position, we can accept
a lower level of signiﬁcance and still expect almost no
false positives from random background ﬂuctuations. Of
our ∼ 600 sources, we expect only ∼ 2 false positives.
This approach is standard for deep ﬁeld Spitzer data,
and WISE catalog construction (e.g., Lang et al. 2014).
In addition, a similar implementation has recently been
performed on the CDF-S/N by Xue et al. (2016).

We determine the ﬂux for each source using the same
prescription followed in Goulding et al. (2012). A counts
to ﬂux conversion is applied assuming a power law spec-
trum with a photon index of 1.9, and Galactic NH
∼ 1 × 1020 cm−2 (Kalberla et al. 2005). We calculate
the X-ray luminosity for each of our sources using the
spectroscopic redshift provided by the NMBS, and bring
each X-ray luminosity to the rest frame by K-correcting
the luminosities using a typical power-law with Γ = 1.9
(Brandt & Hasinger 2005). Finally, we calculate the
hardness ratios for each of our sources, which is given
by

HR =

,

(1)

H − S
H + S

where H is the number of HB counts and S is the num-
ber of SB counts. We use the Bayesian Estimation of
Hardness Ratios code (Park et al. 2006) to calculate the
hardness ratio and its associated uncertainties. Hard-
ness ratios vary from −1 to 1, with typically more posi-
tive values for AGN and more negative values for X-rays
produced by stellar processes (Brandt & Hasinger 2005).
For each of our sources, we compute a false detection
probability, which gives the probability of a spurious X-
ray source being falsely identiﬁed as a signiﬁcant source.
In order to compute the false detection probability, we
assume that the number of background counts have a
Poisson distribution with a mean equal to the number of
counts observed in the background region normalized to
the area of the source region for each source. We then
sample from this distribution 106 times. The false de-
tection probability is the percentage of times that the
sampled distribution produced counts greater than the
observed source counts. We calculate this probability for
the SB, HB, and FB. The false detection probability is
used to set the signiﬁcance of our sources (i.e. a false
detection probability < 4.55% denotes a ≥ 2σ source).
We consider a source to be a ≥ 3σ or ≥ 2σ detection if
it is signiﬁcant to that level in any of the three bands.
AGN are typically detected at hard X-ray energies. But,
given the eﬀective area of the ACIS instrument, Chan-
dra is most sensitive and has the smallest PSF at soft
energies, where the background is also the lowest. In the
low-number Poisson regime, there is a further trade-oﬀ
that more robust detections can be made over the widest
possible energy band. Thus, our false detection proba-
bilities are assigned as follows: full-band, soft-band and
hard-band. The false detection probabilities are listed in
Table 2 for each source detected with a signiﬁcance ≥ 2σ.
Note that the NMBS and Chandra astrometry is within
∼ 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)9 (Nandra et al. 2015), so we allow our ≥ 3σ X-ray

centroid positions to vary by up to 1(cid:48)(cid:48) before applying
the counts to ﬂux conversion.

3. RESULTS

There are 151 low-mass galaxies selected from NMBS
with X-ray ﬂuxes above the detection threshold. As de-
scribed in detail below, we ﬁnd 10 sources with ≥ 3σ
detections and 29 sources with ≥ 2σ signiﬁcant detec-
tions (Section 3.1). We give the optical properties of our
≥ 2σ sources in Table 1, and their X-ray properties in
Table 2. We discuss the nature of these X-ray sources in
Section 3.2.

3.1. X-ray Detections

We consider any ≥ 3σ sources (those with false de-
tection probability < 0.27%) to be a robust X-ray de-
tection. These ten sources are shown circled in blue
in Figure 2 and their properties are given in Table 3.
Their HST and Chandra X-ray Observatory images are
given in Figure 3. Of the ten, seven are signiﬁcant in the
FB and one other band, two are only signiﬁcant sources
in the SB, one is only signiﬁcant in the HB, and two
sources are signiﬁcant in all three bands. Note that the
observed SB and HB correspond to rest-frame 0.75 − 3
keV and 3 − 10 keV, respectively at z = 0.5. The red-

shifts range from z ≈ 0.08 − 0.53, although most of the
sources are below z ∼ 0.3. The rest frame X-ray lumi-
nosities of these sources range from LX ∼ 4×1039 erg s−1
to 2× 1042 erg s−1. The median hardness ratio for these
sources is −0.09, and the median SFR is ∼ 0.3 M(cid:12) yr−1.
Goulding et al. (2012) performed a blind X-ray search in
the AEGIS ﬁeld, and found three sources that correspond
to galaxies in the NMBS survey within our stellar mass
range. Two of those sources, 17650 and 34347, are also
identiﬁed by our method. Our estimated LX agrees with
that from Goulding et al. (2012) for both sources. The
ﬁnal source they identiﬁed, 31041, was removed from our
sample because it is a merging system.

Using the HST data, we can glean some basic infor-
mation about the morphologies of our sources. Most are
late-type spirals at a variety of inclinations (see Figure
3). However, one (19957) is irregular, and one at high
redshift (34347) is compact with little else about its mor-
phology readily identiﬁable. A more quantitative anal-
ysis of the morphologies (e.g., to determine their bulge-
to-disk ratios) is beyond the scope of this paper.
Our ≥ 2σ sources (those with false detection probabil-
ity < 4.55%) are included as grey x’s in Figures 4 and
5, and their properties are included in Tables 1 and 2.
As described in Section 2.2, because our ≥ 2σ sources

given by the NMBS. The black, dashed line gives our mass cut (M(cid:63) < 3 × 109 M(cid:12)).

are at known galaxy positions, the vast majority are real
sources. We include these sources as they enable us to
have a large enough sample to give better statistics on
the AGN properties of our sample as a whole (Section
4).

3.2. Nature of the X-ray Sources

There are multiple processes that may produce X-ray
emission in a star-forming galaxy other than AGN accre-
tion. High-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) are the domi-
nant source of X-rays from star-forming regions (e.g. Fra-
gos et al. 2013). Hot gas associated with supernovae rem-
nants can also emit in the X-ray, although this should be
a very small factor for such low star formation rates (see
Mineo et al. 2012b). At LX > 1040 erg s−1, HMXBs
contribute many orders of magnitude more to the lumi-
nosity than the low-mass X-ray binaries (see, for exam-
ple, Lehmer et al. 2010; Mineo et al. 2012a). Thus, we
need only consider the contribution from HMXBs and X-
ray emitting hot gas from supernovae remnants as AGN
contaminants.

Although we cannot measure detailed X-ray spectra
with so few counts, we can use hardness ratios as a proxy
for the type of X-ray emission we are observing. Ob-
scured AGN (intrinsic NH (cid:38) 1 × 1022 cm−2) normally
have the highest hardness ratios of HR > 0, followed by
unobscured AGN with HR ∼ −0.5. HMXBs and X-ray
emitting hot gas associated with supernovae remnants
normally have very low hardness ratios of HR ≤ −0.8
(Brandt & Hasinger 2005). The hardness ratios for our
≥ 2σ and ≥ 3σ sources are given in Tables 2 & 3, and
plotted versus the spectroscopic redshift in Figure 5. We
plot the expected hardness ratio as a function of red-
shift for an obscured AGN with Γ = 1.9 and intrinsic

Fig. 5.— Hardness Ratio versus z for ≥ 2σ sources selected from
NMBS. The Hardness Ratio, (H − S)/(H + S), is calculated using
the Bayesian Estimation of Hardness Ratio Code. The colored
points are all of the sources selected from NMBS with ≥ 3σ X-ray
detections, while the grey points indicate the ≥ 2σ X-ray sources.
The colors correspond to the SFR, as given by the NMBS. The
various lines give hardness ratios for diﬀerent models as calculated
by the PIMMS online calculator.

NH = 3 × 1022 cm−2 (black, solid line), an unobscured
AGN with Γ = 1.9 (blue, dashed line), an HMXB with
Γ = 3 (green, dotted-dashed line), and hot gas, modeled
by APEC, at ∼ 0.5 keV (red, dotted line). We calcu-
late each of these with the PIMMS online calculator and
allow for a constant galactic NH = 1 × 1020 cm−2. As
shown in the ﬁgure, three of our sources (7290, 19957, &
31097) are clearly obscured AGN as they fall well above

6

the track shown for the model unobscured AGN. Most
of our other sources are consistent with being either an
obscured or unobscured AGN. Our three softest sources
(17650, 33915, & 34347) appear inconsistent with either
AGN model. They are either very heavily obscured AGN
or have X-ray emission due to stellar processes. Note that
for two of these, this is consistent with their SFR rates of
0.47 M(cid:12) yr−1 and 0.11 M(cid:12) yr−1, which are among the
highest of our ≥ 3σ sources. Thus, based on HRs, we
conclude that at least seven of our ten sources are likely
AGN powered.

Now, we consider the possible contamination to the
measured LX due to HMXBs speciﬁcally. To quantify
this contamination, we assign each source an HXMB
probability (i.e. the probability that the X-ray luminos-
ity observed can be attributed to HMXBs). We assume
Gaussian statistics, setting our mean to the observed X-
ray luminosity in the full-band (FB), LX, and compar-
ing it to the estimated X-ray luminosity due to HMXBs,
LHMXB. We obtain LHMXB using the star formation rate
(SFR) given by the NMBS and the relation3 given by
Lehmer et al. (2010):

LHMXB = βSF R ,

(2)
where β = (1.62 ± 0.22) × 1039 erg/s (M(cid:12)/yr)−1. The
LHMXB for each of our sources is given in Table 1. The
68% conﬁdence interval for LHMXB of each of our sources
is shown in Figure 6. The colored points are the mea-
sured LX in the FB for each of our ≥ 3σ sources, where
the colors correspond to the redshift. The grey points
give the measured LX in the FB for all of our ≥ 2σ
sources. Eight of our ≥ 3σ sources are more than 3σ
away from the expected LX from star formation.

Fig. 6.— X-ray luminosity as a function of star formation rate for
the NMBS galaxies with ≥ 2σ X-ray detections. The shaded grey
region indicates the 68% conﬁdence interval for the LHMXB. The
colored points represent the measured X-ray luminosity in the full-
band for our ≥ 3σ sources. The colors correspond to the redshift of
each source. The grey points correspond to our ≥ 2σ sources. Note
that for most of these sources, LX,min is still well above LHMXB.
3 This relation gives the luminosity in the 2−10 keV energy range
at redshift z = 0. However, once this is corrected for the higher
redshifts needed for our study, the energy band is equivalent to our
FB.

Fig. 7.— DEEP2 spectra with important emission lines marked
for our ≥ 3σ X-ray sources. Note that object 31097 has no emission
lines because the lines all fall in detector gaps.

Since high-luminosity X-ray sources will only be pop-
ulated stochastically at these SFRs < 1M(cid:12) yr−1 (Gil-
fanov et al. 2004), we also calculate the total number
of luminous X-ray binaries expected in the entire sam-
ple, including any ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs).
We take the summed SFR for our galaxies with LX ≥
1040 erg s−1, and integrate the best-ﬁt power law for the
luminosity distribution of the HMXBs given by Mineo
et al. (2012a) over the range of luminosities we measured.
We ﬁnd that we should expect (cid:46) 3 HMXBs/ULXs with
LX ≥ 1040 erg s−1 in our entire sample. In line with our
hardness ratio predictions, the distribution of LX (given
the SFRs in our sample) strongly suggests that at least
seven of our ten sources are powered by AGN in the X-
ray. We should stress that the X-ray binary luminosity
function is still largely unknown - it is currently unclear
how to include second order factors, like metallicity.

Another way of diagnosing the source of X-ray emis-
sion is to use the DEEP2 spectra to plot our sources on a
Baldwin, Phillips & Terlevich (BPT) diagram (Baldwin
et al. 1981). These diagrams use line ratios of strong op-
tical emission lines to categorize the source of photoion-
ization in galaxies. Normal star-forming galaxies occupy
the left-hand locus of the BPT diagram, with lower-

cretion to ﬁnd supermassive black holes, there is a nat-
ural degeneracy between the distribution of black hole
mass and the distribution of accretion rates onto the
black holes (e.g., Miller et al. 2015). It is well beyond
the scope of this work to attempt to disentangle these
two, but we do present active black hole fractions and
compare with prior observational and theoretical work.

4.1. Black Hole Masses & Eddington Ratios

Eddington ratios are a useful tool for comparing AGN
fractions from diﬀerent studies; however, the masses of
our black holes, MBH, are very uncertain. As mentioned
in Section 1, we cannot measure the black hole masses
MBH using dynamical methods. We also cannot use the
MBH − σ(cid:63) relation to infer MBH because we do not have
In addition, the MBH − σ(cid:63) relation

has not been well-measured in this low-mass regime (e.g.
Barth et al. 2004; Dong et al. 2012), and may not hold
for late-type spiral galaxies (e.g. Greene et al. 2010).

For lack of more detailed data, we simply assume that
MBH scales with M(cid:63). This scaling is seen (e.g., Reines
& Volonteri 2015), albeit with considerable scatter. To
bracket this range, we take two extremes of the galaxy
population at low mass: NGC 4395 and M32. NGC 4395
is a low-mass bulgeless spiral galaxy with a measured
central SMBH mass of MBH = 4+8−3 × 105M(cid:12) (den Brok
et al. 2015). M32 is a dwarf elliptical galaxy of a similar
mass as NGC 4395, but with a measured central SMBH
mass of MBH = (2.4 ± 1.0) × 106M(cid:12) (van den Bosch &
de Zeeuw 2010). We use NGC 4395 and M32 to bracket
the range of MBH/M(cid:63). For NGC 4395, MBH/M(cid:63),4395 =
3.5× 10−4 (Reines & Volonteri 2015), while for M32 this
is MBH/M(cid:63),M 32 = 8 × 10−4 (van den Bosch & de Zeeuw
2010). We derive a corresponding average black hole
mass range of MBH ∼ 5.5 × 105 − 1.3 × 106 M(cid:12) for both
our ≥ 2σ and ≥ 3σ sources. To ﬁnd the Eddington ratios,
we assume that LX = 0.1 × Lbol (Marconi et al. 2004).
The range of average Eddington ratios, Lbol/LEdd, for
our ≥ 3σ sources is 3 − 7%, and 3 − 6% for our ≥ 2σ
sources.

4.2. The Fraction of AGN in Low-Mass Galaxies

This paper represents the ﬁrst attempt to quantify the
AGN fraction beyond z ∼ 0.4 in ∼ 109 M(cid:12) galaxies.
At the very least, the AGN fraction represents a lower
limit on the fraction of dwarf galaxies that host massive
black holes. As we will show, we are at the limits of the
capabilities of both the optical and X-ray surveys, which
makes quantifying our incompleteness challenging.

Let us start with our X-ray completeness. Examina-
tion of Figure 4 shows that for redshifts 0.2 < z < 0.8,
we are incomplete below an X-ray luminosity of LX ∼
1041 erg s−1. Thus, for calculating our active fraction
we will only consider sources with LX greater than this
limit.

Our optical limit, on the other hand, has a more com-
plicated selection function. First, we ﬁnd our stellar
masses from the NMBS survey, whose point-source de-
tection limit is mK = 23.2 AB. However, we also require
a DEEP2 spectrum, which introduces a known incom-
pleteness for faint red galaxies with z > 0.7 (Newman
et al. 2013). We examine the ratio of NMBS to DEEP2
sources in redshift bins, and ﬁnd that this ratio remains

Fig. 8.— A Baldwin, Phillips & Terlevich (BPT) diagram (Bald-
win et al. 1981). The dashed lines indicate the line ratios for our
≥ 3σ sources. The blue contours are given by all of the dwarf
galaxies in SDSS, while the grey contours are all of the AGN in
SDSS. The position of NGC 4395 is given as a reference. Note that
our sources, as a whole, will most likely lie between the positions
of the dwarf galaxies in SDSS and the AGNs in SDSS. The dotted
lines give the boundary between starburst galaxies and AGN as
found by Kauﬀmann et al. (2003b) (lower line) and Kewley et al.
(2001) (upper line).

metallicity sources typically having lower [N II]/Hα and
higher [O III]/Hβ (e.g., Moustakas & Kennicutt 2006).
AGN appear in the upper-right of the diagram, while
AGN in low-mass galaxies, which also have low metal-
licity, tend to fall to the left of the typical AGN se-
quence due to their lower-than-average [N II]/Hα (e.g.,
NGC4395; Groves et al. 2006; Ludwig et al. 2009).
The DEEP2 spectra for our ≥ 3σ sources are given
in Figure 7. With the exception of 31097, which was
at the exact redshift where all of the necessary emission
lines were in detector gaps, all of our sources exhibit
strong [N II], [O III], Hα, or Hβ emission lines. Due
to the coverage of DEEP2, none of the spectra include
all of the lines needed to properly place the sources in a
BPT diagram. However, we can consider the sample as
an ensemble by plotting the ratios we do have for each
source (either [N II]/Hα or [O III]/Hβ). The intersection
of these lines places the sample in a spot on the BPT
diagram ([N II]/Hα ∼ 0.15 − 0.35, [O III]/Hβ ∼ 2 − 3)
between normal SDSS dwarf galaxies and AGN within
SDSS (see Figure 8). This is consistent with the low-
metallicity AGN described by Groves et al. (2006). Thus,
the BPT diagram indirectly argues for AGN powering in
our sources as well.

Therefore,

the

ratios,
LX/SFR, and optical line ratios together strongly imply
that our sample is dominated by AGN.

4. AGN PROPERTIES

As mentioned in Section 1, the SMBH occupation frac-
tion in dwarf galaxies can be an important constraint on
possible SMBH formation mechanisms. When we use ac-

8
constant out to z ∼ 0.8 if we restrict our attention to
galaxies with M(cid:63) > 109 M(cid:12). Thus, for calculating an
AGN fraction, we also restrict our attention to a mass
and redshift range of 109 M(cid:12) ≤ M(cid:63) ≤ 3 × 109 M(cid:12) and
0.1 < z < 0.6.

The AGN fraction, fAGN , for our sources within these

limits is given by

N(cid:88)

(1 − P i

false)(1 − P i

HMXB)

,

(3)

fAGN =

Ntotal

where Pfalse is the false detection probability, PHMXB is
the HMXB probability (see Section 3.2), and Ntotal is the
total number of galaxies analyzed with mass 109 M(cid:12) ≤
M(cid:63) ≤ 3 × 109 M(cid:12) and 0.1 < z < 0.6. All of our ≥ 3σ
sources with luminosity above the incomplete luminosity
limit, Lmin = 1041 erg s−1, are included in this calcula-
tion. The AGN fraction for our ≥ 3σ sources is 0.6%. To
boost our statistics, we also compute the AGN fraction
for our ≥ 2σ sources, which we ﬁnd to be 3%. This is
within the rough observational uncertainties of the ≥ 3σ
fraction given. These fractions are shown in Figure 9.

Fig. 9.— Active Fraction as a function of redshift. The blue,
striped region gives our measured AGN fraction for our ≥ 2σ and
≥ 3σ sources with 109 M(cid:12) ≤ M(cid:63) ≤ 3×109 M(cid:12), 0.1 < z < 0.6, and
LX ≥ 1041 erg s−1. The blue dashed line gives the AGN fraction
found using semi-analytic models and applying the same luminosity
and mass cuts. The red, hashed region gives the AGN fraction
found by extrapolating from Aird et al. (2012) for 109 M(cid:12) ≤ M(cid:63) ≤
3 × 109 M(cid:12) and 0.2 < z < 0.6. The red triangle gives the Reines
et al. (2013) AGN fraction, which is for 107 < M(cid:63) < 109.5 M(cid:12).

Several studies have measured AGN fractions for dwarf
galaxies in the local universe. It is highly non-trivial to
compare our fractions with these others studies, given the
diﬀerent techniques, depths, and redshifts of the diﬀerent
surveys. Miller et al. (2015) give an AGN fraction in red,
low-mass galaxies down to L/LEdd ∼ 10−4 for the local
Universe of > 20% for M(cid:63) < 1010 M(cid:12). We do not probe
this low Eddington regime here. At higher AGN lumi-
nosities, Reines et al. (2013) study dwarf galaxies in the
local Universe, and ﬁnd a much lower optically-selected
AGN fraction of ∼ 0.5% for 107 < M(cid:63) < 109.5 M(cid:12) with
a typical Eddington fraction of ∼ 10%, but no incom-
pleteness correction was applied. Looking at the local
obscured AGN population as a whole, as probed by the
SDSS, the AGN fraction is ∼ 10% down to an Eddington
fraction of ∼ 1% (Kauﬀmann et al. 2003b).

Perhaps more comparable are the X-ray studies of Aird
et al. (2012) and Goulding et al. (2012), which use similar
X-ray deep-ﬁeld data. They ﬁnd AGN fractions of ∼ 1%
up to z ∼ 1 for their entire samples. Note that they have
a diﬀerent signiﬁcance criteria than adopted here, and
thus typically lower AGN fractions.

Examining the Aird et al. (2012) study in more detail,
we ﬁnd that they measured the active fraction for M(cid:63) >
3× 109 M(cid:12) in the redshift range z = 0.2− 0.6. Although
Aird et al. (2012) does not provide an active fraction for
the same mass bin as our study, we can extrapolate to our
mass range from the data they do provide. Using a linear
extrapolation from Aird’s Figure 4, we predict an active
fraction for z = 0.2−0.6 and 109 M(cid:12) ≤ M(cid:63) ≤ 3×109 M(cid:12)
of ∼ 0.2% − 28%.

More recently, Mezcua et al. (2016) completed an X-
ray stacking analysis of the COSMOS ﬁeld for the same
mass ranges up to redshifts z < 1.5. However, since
stacking was used and they only considered late-type spi-
rals and starburst galaxies (the early-type galaxies from
the sample were studied in Paggi et al. 2015), we cannot
give a direct comparison with their work.
Thus, our calculated active fraction at z ∼ 0.2 − 0.6 is

consistent with previous observations.

4.3. Comparison to Semi-Analytic Models

We compare the fractions of detected active black holes
with the predictions of semi-analytic models of the joint
formation and evolution of galaxies and SMBH from
Somerville et al. (2008, see also Hirschmann et al. 2012).
These models are based on cosmological merger trees
and contain recipes for the usual processes included in
models of galaxy formation, including gas accretion and
cooling, star formation, and stellar feedback.
In addi-
tion, in these models, each top-level halo is seeded with
a 104M(cid:12) black hole. Black hole accretion is triggered by
mergers with mass ratio greater than 1:10, based on the
results of hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy mergers
(Hopkins et al. 2006, 2007), and the black hole growth
is self-regulated by radiative feedback from the accret-
ing black hole, resulting in power-law lightcurves as de-
scribed in Hopkins et al. (2006). Here we consider a
model in which black hole accretion is triggered only by
mergers, although in reality secular processes and inter-
nal disk instabilities are likely also important for driving
black hole accretion (see Hirschmann et al. 2012).

We select galaxies from a mock AEGIS lightcone using
the same stellar mass criteria and redshift range as for
the observed sample. Our model predicts the accretion
rate onto the black hole, and we convert this to an X-
ray luminosity using a conversion of rest mass to energy
of 0.1, and the bolometric correction to the hard X-ray
band from Marconi et al. (2004). We do not account
for obscuration of the AGN radiation. We then compute
the active fraction by counting the fraction of galaxies
in the relevant stellar mass and redshift bins with LX ≥
1041 erg s−1.
In this way, we ﬁnd a detected active fraction for
109 M(cid:12) ≤ M(cid:63) ≤ 3 × 109 M(cid:12) and 0.1 ≤ z ≤ 0.6 of 3.1%,
which is encouragingly close to the observational results
presented here (see Figure 9). The mean Eddington frac-
tion for the black holes in the simulation is 3.6%. We
have also done the exercise of adding the X-ray ﬂux that
would be expected from high-mass X-ray binaries using

Equation 2 and the stellar masses and SFR predicted by
the model. We ﬁnd that only a few additional galaxies
would be above the adopted X-ray detection limit due to
the added contribution to the X-ray ﬂux from HMXBs,
resulting in a negligible change in our predicted active
fractions. This is consistent with the results shown in
Figure 6.

5. SUMMARY AND FUTURE WORK

Here, we study a sample of 599 dwarf galaxies with
the aim of ﬁnding AGN and constraining the AGN frac-
tion in these galaxies. First, we identify dwarf galaxies
(M(cid:63) < 3 × 109M(cid:12)) with redshift z < 1 using the NEW-
FIRM Medium-Band Survey, along with HST observa-
tions and DEEP2 spectra. We then perform aperture
photometry using available Chandra ACIS-I data at the
optical positions of the dwarf galaxies. We identify 10
AGN with ≥ 3σ certainty and ∼ 30 AGN with ≥ 2σ
certainty out of our sample of nearly 600 galaxies. It is
diﬃcult to directly separate the emission of high-mass X-
ray binaries (HMXBs) from low-luminosity AGN in these
galaxies, but we use several diﬀerent techniques to argue
that the majority of our sources are AGN. Most of the
hardness ratios of our sources are consistent with AGN
rather than HMXBs or X-ray emitting hot gas associated
with supernovae remnants, which both have more nega-
tive hardness ratios than those we observed. In addition,
the LX we measure is much higher than the estimated X-
ray luminosity due to star formation. Also, the number
of HMXBs/ULXs in our sample with X-ray luminosities
as high as those observed is estimated to be very low.
Furthermore, by plotting the optical line ratios found
in the DEEP2 spectra of our sources on a BPT diagram,
we ﬁnd that they tend to occupy a region consistent with
other AGN.

Finally, we use our results to calculate an AGN fraction
for dwarf galaxies - the ﬁrst time this has been directly
calculated beyond the local universe. We ﬁnd a fraction
of 0.6 − 3% for 109 M(cid:12) ≤ M(cid:63) ≤ 3 × 109 M(cid:12) and 0.1 ≤
z ≤ 0.6. This agrees well with other studies, like Miller
et al. (2015) and Reines et al. (2013), that ﬁnd the active
fraction for dwarf galaxies in the nearby universe.
It
also agrees with extrapolations of Aird et al. (2012) to
our mass range. We also compared our results to semi-
analytic models. These models seeded all top-level halos
with 104 M(cid:12) black holes, and assume that accretion was
triggered only by mergers. We ﬁnd that these results
agree well with our observed fraction.

There are some caveats to these results. We exclude
mergers, where the AGN fraction may be higher. We
did apply our X-ray analysis to the 43 galaxies that we
excluded for being point sources or mergers. Of those, we
found 3 to have ≥ 3σ X-ray sources. This would increase
our ≥ 3σ AGN fraction to a maximum of ∼ 2%.
In
addition, it is diﬃcult to know the fraction of HMXBs in
these galaxies as the eﬀects of metallicity on the HMXB
luminosity distribution are still unknown, and these are
relatively metal poor systems compared to the galaxies
typically studied.
it is still too early to give any con-

straints on supermassive black hole seeds. However, it
is clear that at least some ∼ 109 M(cid:12) galaxies must have
SMBHs. We hope to apply our technique to a larger cos-
mological volume and over a wider range of masses. In
future work, we plan to explore how the predictions of
semi-analytic models and numerical hydrodynamic simu-
lations depend on black hole seeding mechanisms, as well
as physical mechanisms for the triggering and regulation
of black hole growth. This will allow us to properly com-
pare the AGN fractions with other studies, and to give a
constraint on seeding mechanisms.
