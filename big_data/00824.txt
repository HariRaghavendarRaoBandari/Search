ABSTRACT
We present late time, low frequency observations of SN 2011dh made using the Giant Metre-
wave Radio Telescope (GMRT). Our observations at 325 MHz, 610 MHz and 1280 MHz
conducted between 93 − 421 days after the explosion supplement the millimeter and centi-
meter wave observations conducted between 4 − 15 days after explosion using the Combined
Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA) and extensive radio observa-
tions (1.0 − 36.5 GHz) conducted between 16 − 93 days after explosion using Jansky Very
Large Array (JVLA). We ﬁt a synchrotron self absorption model (SSA) to the 610 MHz and
1280 MHz radio light curves. We use it to determine the radius (Rp) and magnetic ﬁeld (Bp)
at 173 & 323 days after the explosion. A comparison of the peak radio luminosity Lop, with
the product of the peak frequency νp and time to peak tp shows that the supernova evolves
between the epochs of CARMA, JVLA and GMRT observations. It shows a general slowing
down of the expansion speed of the radio emitting region on a timescale of several hundred
days during which the shock is propagating through a circumstellar medium set up by a wind
with a constant mass loss parameter, ˙M/w. We derive the mass loss parameter (A⋆) based on
610 MHz and 1280 MHz radio light curves, which are found to be consistent with each other
within error limits.
Key words: supernovae: individual (SN 2011dh) – stars: mass-loss – radiation mechanisms:
non-thermal – radio continuum: general – techniques: interferometric.

1 INTRODUCTION

Identifying the nature of progenitors is a key question in the study
of core-collapse and thermonuclear supernovae. Type IIb super-
nova are an intermediate class of core-collapse supernova between
the Type II and Type Ib supernovae (Filippenko 1997). Their
spectra show a transition from Type II supernovae (photospheric
Balmer, Hα, lines in early time spectra, near maximum brightness)
to a spectra characteristic of Type Ib supernovae (absence of broad
Hα emission lines in late time spectra). The prototypical example
of type IIb supernovae is SN 1993J. Their progenitor stars are be-
lieved to have lost most of the outer Hydrogen envelope prior to
collapse. The mechanisms which can cause the star to lose their
hydrogen envelope may diﬀer for single stars vs stars in binaries.
The binaries can have a) mass transfer with a companion star while
b) stellar winds c) pulsations and eruptions of evolved supergiants
can operate in both single and binary stars. Most models for the
prototypical IIb SN 1993J were binary based (Nomoto et al. 1996,

1993; Ray et al. 1993; Podsiadlowski et al. 1993; Utrobin 1994;
Woosley et al. 1994; Smith 2014). Therefore when the supernova
is young the lines are formed in the thin Hydrogen envelope and
as the supernova ejecta expands with age the inner and deeper
layers are exposed revealing the Helium zone. Type IIb super-
novae therefore provide a link between the progenitors of Hydro-
gen rich Type II (the Hydrogen envelope is intact before collapse)
and Hydrogen poor Type Ib/c supernovae (massive stars stripped of
their Hydrogen envelope). Chevalier & Soderberg 2010 have pro-
posed that Type IIb supernovae can be sub-divided into compact
IIb (Type cIIb) with R⋆ ∼ 1011 cm) and extended IIb (Type eIIb)
with R⋆ ∼ 1013 cm) based on the mass-loss history and radius of
the progenitor star and properties of the forward shock. Type eIIb
have smooth radio light curves and slower shock, whereas Type
cIIb have modulations in their radio light curves and high shock
velocities (∼ 0.1c).

SN 2011dh is a Type IIb supernova which exploded in the
spiral galaxy M51 (distance taken in this work D ∼ 8.4 ± 0.6 Mpc
(Feldmeier et al. 1997)). It was discovered in the optical by A.Riou
on 2011 May 31.89 UT; Griga et al. 2011 and on 2011 Jun 01.19
UT by the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF, Law et al. 2009; Rau

Naveen Yadav et al.

et al. 2009); Silverman et al. 2011. Its evolution was followed in
multiple wavelengths as it was a bright nearby supernova. Arcavi
et al. 2011b suggested its classiﬁcation as a Type IIb supernova
on the basis of similarities between the spectrum of SN 2011dh
reported by (Silverman et al. 2011) and a spectrum of SN 1993J
and SN 2008ax.

In this work we present the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope
(GMRT) observations of SN 2011dh. We derive the properties of
the post-shock plasma based on SSA model using combination
of GMRT data and other archival data. We put together our res-
ults with published parameters based on Combined Array for Re-
search in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA) and Jansky Very
Large Array (JVLA, hereafter referred as VLA) data. In section 2,
we present a brief summary of the published work on SN 2011dh
and its progenitor star. In section 3 we present the radio observa-
tions and their reduction. The salient features of the radio emission
model are discussed brieﬂy in section 4. This is followed by the res-
ults in section 5. In section 6 we discuss the long term evolution of
the parameters of this SN, including the long term mass loss from
the progenitor before it exploded as obtained from CARMA, VLA
and GMRT data.

2 PREVIOUS OPTICAL, RADIO AND X-RAY

OBSERVATIONS OF SN 2011DH AND ITS
PROGENITOR

SN 2011dh was discovered in radio by Horesh et al. 2011 on 2011
June 04.25 UT. Horesh et al. 2013 reported extensive early time
(day 4 to day 16 after explosion) mm (33.6 GHz, 44.2 GHz, 93 GHz
and 107 GHz) and cm (4.8 GHz, 5.0 GHz, 7.4 GHz, 8.5 GHz
and 22.5 GHz) CARMA and VLA observations of SN 2011dh.
They concluded that in order to reconcile the radio emission model
(Chevalier 1998) and X-ray emission model (inverse Compton (IC)
mechanism (Beall 1979; Chevalier 1982b)) an equipartition value
1, feB ≈ 500 − 1700 is required, which leads to a shock wave velo-
city of ∼ 15000 ± 1800 km s−1. Soderberg et al. 2012 argued that
the X-ray emission can be attributed to IC mechanism provided
the equipartition assumption is relaxed ( feB ≈ 30 and ǫB ≈ 0.01)
which leads to a doubling of mass loss rate. Krauss et al. 2012 ob-
served radio emission (> 16 days) of SN 2011dh extensively with
VLA and ﬁtted the observations with the synchrotron self absorp-
tion model (Chevalier 1998). It is to be noted that there is a dis-
crepancy in the shock velocity inferred by Soderberg et al. 2012
(∼ 3.0 × 109 cm/s) and Horesh et al. 2013 (∼ 2.1 × 109 cm/s) as-
suming equipartition. Maeda 2012 incorporated IC cooling to cal-
culate the radio light curves and obtained strong constraints on the
eﬃciency of the electron acceleration (ǫe) and magnetic ﬁeld amp-
liﬁcation (ǫB) in the post-shock region. They obtained ǫe < 0.01,
which is smaller by a factor of ∼ 30 compared to the value sug-
gested by Soderberg et al. 2012. Maeda 2012 also suggested that
a single power law electron distribution cannot explain the radio
and X-ray emission together and a pre-acceleration injection pop-
ulation of electrons peaking around Lorentz factor γ ∼ 20 − 30 in
addition to a power law extending to higher energy is required. It
should be noted that the results of Horesh et al. 2013 and Soderberg
et al. 2012 are based on early time (< 16 days) radio emission from
SN 2011dh whereas the results of Krauss et al. 2012 are based on
late time (∼ 16 − 93 days) radio emission.

1 Equipartition factor ( feB) is the ratio of fraction of post-shock energy
density in relativistic electrons and post-shock magnetic ﬁeld respectively.

Soderberg et al. 2012 inferred a high forward shock velocity
s ∼ 0.1c on the basis of radio observations which indicated that the
progenitor was compact. They also used the early time (< 5 days)
optical observations to constrain the size of progenitor star. They
found the progenitor star to be consistent with a compact progenitor
at the time of explosion R⋆ ∼ 1011 cm (Type cIIb) and is dissim-
ilar from those of Type eIIb SNe. A similar conclusion was arrived
at on the basis of the SN’s optical light curve and measurement of
its photospheric temperature Arcavi et al. 2011a. A putative pro-
genitor was detected in the pre-explosion Hubble Space Telescope
images by Li & Filippenko 2011, Maund et al. 2011 and Van Dyk
et al. 2011. Maund et al. 2011 found that the progenitor star is con-
sistent with an F8 supergiant star on the basis of its spectral energy
distribution (SED). On the basis of comparison with stellar evolu-
tion tracks they suggested that it corresponds to a single star at the
end of core C-burning with an initial mass of MZAMS = 13 ± 3 M⊙.
Van Dyk et al. 2011 found that the star’s radius (∼ 1013 cm) is
more extended than what has been inferred for the SN progenitor
by Soderberg et al. 2012 and Arcavi et al. 2011a. They speculated
that the detected star is either an unrelated star very near the posi-
tion of the actual progenitor, or, more likely, the progenitor’s com-
panion in a mass-transfer binary system. They found the position
of the detected star in a Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram to be
consistent with initial mass of MZAMS ∼ 17 − 19 M⊙. Murphy
et al. 2011 estimated the mass of the progenitor based on stellar
population synthesis and found that MZAMS to be in close agree-
ment with the estimate of Maund et al. 2011. Early optical and near
IR photometry and spectroscopy of SN 2011dh showed fast evol-
ution. Ergon et al. 2014, 2015 found a small amount of hydrogen
(∼ 0.01 − 0.04 M⊙) in the envelope, and they made a detailed com-
parison with the prototypical type IIb SN 1993J.

Bersten et al. 2012 computed a set of hydrodynamical models
and found that a large progenitor star with R⋆ ∼ 200 R⊙ is needed
to reproduce the early light curve which was consistent with the
hypothesis that the detected yellow-supergiant in the pre-explosion
HST images was the progenitor star. They also suggested that a
single star evolutionary scenario for the progenitor of SN 2011dh
is unlikely. Benvenuto et al. 2013 proposed that the progenitor be-
longs to a close binary (16 M⊙ +10 M⊙) system on the basis of stel-
lar evolutionary calculations following the evolution of both stars
in the system. Van Dyk et al. 2013 reported the vanishing of yellow
supergiant as seen in the pre explosion images which is consist-
ent with the analysis by Bersten et al. 2012 and Benvenuto et al.
2013. There has been considerable debate about the nature of the
residual emission from the location of the SN. Using HST observa-
tions in the F225W and F336W bands on day 1664, Folatelli et al.
2014 claimed that the residual blue point source was the hot com-
pact companion of the progenitor YSG star that has exploded in
2011 as predicted by Benvenuto et al. 2013. This has however been
contested by Maund et al. 2015 who argue on the basis of UV and
optical HST observations at approximately the same day that the
Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of the late time source is incon-
sistent with that of a stellar source although a partial contribution
to the observed UV ﬂux from the possibly still present companion
star cannot be ruled out. The separate claims of the two groups are
subject to key assumptions made in their respective analyses. While
Folatelli et al. 2014 assume that the UV ﬂux originated only from
the binary companion, Maund et al. 2015 show this is not borne
out by the expected decrease of the ﬂux at redder wavelengths and
the observed SED is contrary to such expectations. On the other
hand, the analysis of Maund et al. 2015 is subject to the assump-
tion that there is no signiﬁcant circumstellar interaction of the SN

MNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)

which is contaminating the observed SED. Although they state that
the presence of signiﬁcant late time ﬂux at optical wavelengths in
SN 2011dh suggests that the UV ﬂux is not necessarily attributable
to a binary companion, a binary companion could still be hidden in
the light of the SN itself thereby constraining the progenitor mass
to a lower value than has been estimated so far. This in turn would
imply that the mass transfer which stripped the progenitor star’s
hydrogen envelope was not very eﬃcient (compared to the case for
SN 1993J) and most of the mass lost from the progenitor may have
been lost from the system rather than accreted on the companion. It
is possible, as claimed by Maund et al. 2015 that a binary compan-
ion is not a prerequisite for the progenitor of SN 2011dh, for e.g.,
SN 1993J which showed a signiﬁcant evidence of a hot binary com-
panion to its progenitor whereas in the case of SN 2008ax very late
HST observations conﬁrmed the disappearance of the original pre-
supernova star and did not show any residual from a stellar remnant
at the SN position. Our GMRT observations have bearing on these
issues, which we describe below.

SN 2011dh was observed in X-rays using Swift from ∼ 3 −
50 days after the explosion (Margutti & Soderberg 2011; Soder-
berg et al. 2012; Campana & Immler 2012). It was also observed
by XMM-Newton on two epochs: 2011 June 07.20 UT & 2011
June 11.20 UT (Campana & Immler 2012) and by Chandra on
two epochs : 2011 June 12.30 UT (Pooley 2011) & 2011 July
03.40 UT (PI: A.M. Soderberg) at early times. Chandra looked
at M51 on 2012 Sept 09 through 2012 Oct 10 (PI: K.D. Kuntz),
which provided a long exposure of SN 2011dh corresponding to
467 − 498 days after the explosion (Maeda et al. 2014). Soderberg
et al. 2012 reported spectral softening with time on the basis of
spectrum extracted from June 3-7 (photon index: 0.9±0.3) and June
7-17 (photon index: 1.8 ± 0.2) and also noted that the X-ray lumin-
osity is lower by a factor of ≈ 10 compared to the well observed
Type eIIb SN 1993J and SN 2001gd. According to their analysis,
synchrotron emission at forward shock and free-free emission at
reverse shock do not explain the the origin of X-ray emission. They
suggested that the X-ray emission may be due to IC emission. Sa-
saki & Ducci 2012 detected a hard component in the XMM-Newton
spectrum taken at ∼ 7 days which disappeared by ∼ 11 days. They
suggested that the soft component in the X-ray emission can be
identiﬁed as IC emission while the harder component has its origin
in the shocked circumstellar gas. Campana & Immler 2012 have ﬁt-
ted the early time (7 day and 11 day) X-ray data with two hot diﬀuse
gas component model originating at the forward shock and reverse
shock respectively and also show the existence of a non-negligible
absorption column in addition to Galactic column density. A sim-
ilar study was done for the case of SN 1993J (Uno et al. 2002) in
which it was found that the low-temperature component has much
higher column depth than the high-temperature component. Maeda
et al. 2014 also derived mass-loss rate (∼ 3×10−6 M⊙ yr−1 for wind
velocity of ∼ 20 kms−1) of the progenitor based on the late time
(∼ 500 days) Chandra X-ray observations. Note that X-rays and ra-
dio probe diﬀerent parts of the SN with the reverse shock emission
measure being sensitive to ejecta density proﬁle, in addition to that
of the circumstellar medium while the radio probes the blastwave
shock’s interaction with the CSM. The estimates of Maeda et al.
2014 are based on very steep (ρej ∝ r−n, n ∼ 20) ejecta density
proﬁles, which is similar to that inferred for SN 1993J (Suzuki &
Nomoto 1995; Fransson et al. 1996).

3 GMRT OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION

The data presented in this work were acquired using the Giant
Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) in full intensity mode and
with a 32 MHz bandwidth at 325 MHz, 610 MHz and 1280 MHz
between 93−421 days after the explosion. Our observations supple-
ment the millimeter (33.6 GHz, 44.2 GHz, 93 GHz and 107 GHz)
and centimeter wave (4.8 GHz, 5.0 GHz, 7.4 GHz, 8.5 GHz and
22.5 GHz) observations conducted between 4 − 15 days after ex-
plosion using the CARMA and extensive radio observations (1.0 −
36.5 GHz) using the VLA conducted between 16 − 93 days after
explosion. All the datasets have been analyzed using standard tech-
niques in Astronomical Image Processing System (AIPS). Each
dataset was manually ﬂagged for instances of Radio Frequency In-
terference (RFI) and malfunctioning baselines and subsequently the
raw visibilities were calibrated using 3C286 (which is both the ﬂux
calibrator as well as the phase calibrator). The bandpass calibrated
dataset was used for imaging using the AIPS task IMAGR. The
source ﬂux was obtained using AIPS task JMFIT. The reported im-
age RMS are obtained from the region surrounding the source. The
details of the observation are presented in Table 1. The errors used
in the analysis have been calculated using
I + σ2
C,

to take in to account calibration errors and other unknown eﬀects.
Here σI is rms noise in the image and σC is the 10% of the determ-
ined ﬂux taken as calibration error. The ﬁtting results are summar-
ized in Table 2.

4 SYNCHROTRON SELF ABSORPTION MODEL

Radio emission from core collapse supernovae has long been ar-
gued to be of non-thermal origin (Chevalier 1982a,b; Fransson &
Björnsson 1998). It originates at the forward shock where elec-
trons are accelerated to relativistic energies and magnetic ﬁelds are
strong. These electrons radiate by synchrotron mechanism in the
post-shock ampliﬁed magnetic ﬁeld. The early time, low frequency
turnover in the spectral energy density seen in many SNe can be
due to synchrotron self absorption (SSA) and/or free-free absorp-
tion (FFA) (Chevalier 1982a, 1998), and their relative importance
in the context of the prototypical type IIb SN 1993J has been dis-
cussed by Fransson & Björnsson 1998. We use the SSA model
to ﬁt our GMRT radio light curves and extract model parameters.
Krauss et al. 2012 also have used the SSA model to ﬁt the early data

4

Naveen Yadav et al.

from VLA (and CARMA) of SN 2011dh. However, while Krauss
et al. 2012 ﬁt the broad-band spectral energy distribution at speciﬁc
epochs, we use the SSA model to ﬁt our light curves.

We model the 610 MHz and the 1280 MHz data using the
synchrotron self absorption model (Chevalier 1998). The electron
index p (the electron energy distribution function index p is deﬁned
as: N(E) ∝ E−p) is taken to be 2.8 in accordance with Krauss et al.
2012. The blast wave expands according to a power-law: R ∝ tm,
where the value of m is taken to be: 0.87 ±0.07 (Krauss et al. 2012).
The non thermal radio ﬂux at any given frequency can be written
as (Chevalier 1998)

and where tp is the age at which the optical depth becomes unity and

5 RESULTS

We ﬁt the low frequency data with the synchrotron self absorp-
tion model (see Equation 2) which has been presented in the previ-
ous section (ﬁxing the value of m and p from Krauss et al. 2012).
The ﬁts to the low frequency radio data are shown in Figure 1.
The 610 MHz data point on 93.2 day falls on the spectrum re-
ported by Krauss et al. 2012 on 92.9 day as shown in Figure 3.
The ﬁt at 1280 MHz shown in Figure 1 (bottom panel) comprises
of all the available L-Band data from GMRT and VLA (Krauss
et al. 2012). The 1.40 GHz VLA data has been scaled to 1.28 GHz
(using optically thick synchrotron emission scaling: F1.28/F1.40 =
(1.28/1.40)5/2) for the purpose of ﬁtting. We derive the values of Rp
and Bp using Equation 4 & 5 and assuming equipartition ( feB = 1).
We can use the radio emission models derived by (Krauss et al.
2012) and Horesh et al. 2013 to predict the radio ﬂux densities for
GMRT observations. We have plotted the predicted ﬂux densities
based on model from Krauss et al. 2012 and Horesh et al. 2013
along with the observed ﬂux densities in Figure 1 & 2. Krauss et al.
2012 have used the SSA model to ﬁt the broadband radio spectra on
various days. The model is written as (Equation 1 in Krauss et al.
2012)

where S ντ is the ﬂux density at frequency ντ, at which the op-
tical depth is unity. The Krauss et al. 2012 predictions shown in
Figure 1 & 2 are calculated using their ﬁt parameters for broad-
band radio spectra at 92.9 day (S ντ = 6.44 ± 0.21 mJy and ντ =
2.235 ± 0.076 GHz). We have taken the parameters correspond-
ing to 92.9 day as it is the closest to GMRT observation epoch on
93 day and onwards. To calculate the ﬂux densities based on Horesh
et al. 2013 we have used the following equations from Horesh et al.
2013:

feB =

ǫB

,

(6)

where ǫe and ǫB are the fraction of energy density in relativistic
electrons and post-shock magnetic ﬁeld respectively. The wind

written as

In the circumstellar interaction model a fraction ǫB, of the thermal
energy of shocked medium is converted to post-shock magnetic
ﬁeld energy. The energy density in magnetic ﬁeld uB, can be related
to the mass loss parameter A⋆, using Equation 8 from Chevalier &
Fransson 2006 as

2013 deviate more from the observed late time data compared to
the predicted ﬂux densities based on the model from Krauss et al.
2012. This may be due to the fact that the two models were based
on diﬀerent time ranges of observations and the parameters that
determine the radio emission have changed with time. This is in
contrast to many cases where the radio emission from a supernova
can be consistently ﬁtted with a model valid across temporal and
frequency coverage of the observations. We note that Fransson &
Björnsson 1998 advocated an evolution in the shock speed for the
case of SN 1993J, with a break after ∼ 100 days. For the case of
325 MHz observations, we have detection at two epochs and an up-
per limit on the ﬂux density. Therefore we have not attempted to
ﬁt the radio light curve, and we show the observed data in Figure 2
along with the predicted values. We have obtained radius and mag-
netic ﬁeld at two epochs using Equation 4 & 5. The errors in these

In Figure 4, we plot the radius and magnetic ﬁeld values we
obtain along with the values reported in literature (Krauss et al.
2012; Horesh et al. 2013; Bietenholz et al. 2012; de Witt et al. 2016)
for the purpose of comparison. Our GMRT measurements taken
along with VLA and Very long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI)
measurements are consistent with a deceleration index m = 0.96 for
radio sphere evolution. The values of dimensionless parameter A⋆
(using ǫB = 0.1) are plotted in Figure 5. All the points are based on
ﬁtting a radio spectra except the latest two points, which are based
on 610 MHz and 1280 MHz (VLA+GMRT) light curves, therefore
the corresponding A⋆ is valid for the entire duration of the corres-
ponding light curve at a given frequency. There are small variations
in the mass loss rate ( ˙M = 6.2 × 1012
wA⋆ gm s−1), but the average
value of A⋆ is around ∼ 3.7+1.3
−0.3. Using this A⋆ = 3.7 we obtain a
nearly constant value of mass loss rate of, ˙M = 7.2 × 10−7 M⊙ yr−1
for a yellow supergiant progenitor with an assumed wind speed of
w = 20 km/s. In Figure 6, we plot Fop vs. νptp using all the ﬁts
from Horesh et al. 2013 and Krauss et al. 2012 including our meas-
urements based on 610 MHz and 1280 MHz. This type of plot was
used by Chevalier 1998 to distinguish between diﬀerent types of su-
pernovae on the basis of their radio emission properties. The peak
luminosity Lop and mean forward shock velocity p can be related
(for p = 2.8) using Equation 4 as

where Lop = 4πD2Fop is the peak radio spectral luminos-

moves on the plot between various constant velocity lines and the
velocity decreases as the object ages. The average shock velocity
2.5 × 109 cm s−1 (based on feB = 1) quoted by Krauss et al. 2012
appears to be on the left corner of this diagram (refer to Figure 6),
while that of the Horesh et al. 2013 overlaps with the range of ve-
locities shown between the black and blue lines. The shock appears
to slow down with time according to this diagram which supports
m < 1.

Figure 5. The mass loss parameter A⋆ plotted for the observation time range
of 3 − 450 days. The parameter shows some variation which is consistent
with an average value of around 3.5. All the points are calculated based
on ǫB = 0.1 and are based on ﬁtting a radio spectra except the last two
points, which are based on 610 MHz and 1280 MHz (VLA+GMRT) light
curve. The corresponding A⋆ is therefore valid for the entire duration of the
respective light curve.

data (empty squares). The points labeled as [a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m &

been obtained using Equation 16 as in Chevalier 1998. Note the evolution
between expansion speeds at early times (VLA) to late times (GMRT).

6 DISCUSSIONS

In Figure 4 we show the time evolution of the shock wave radius
based on GMRT data together with VLBI and early VLA data. We
have drawn a line with slope m ∼ 0.96 (de Witt et al. 2016), and the
shaded error regions correspond to error in the ﬁts by Krauss et al.
2012 (m ∼ 0.87 ± 0.07) and Horesh et al. 2013 (m ∼ 1.14 ± 0.24).
It is evident that the SN shock has been propagating through a
circumstellar medium set up by a wind with constant mass loss
˙M/vw. If we assume that a pre-SN stellar wind speed,
parameter,
vw = 20 km/s (corresponding to the constant wind speed of a yel-
low supergiant), then the radio observations imply an average value
˙M = 7.2 × 10−7 M⊙yr−1, which is a factor of
of mass loss rate of
∼ 4 smaller than the determination by Maeda et al. 2014 from X-
ray analysis. We note that the deviations of predicted ﬂux densit-
ies from the observed radio ﬂux densities is more for the case of
Horesh et al. 2013 compared to Krauss et al. 2012 (see Figure 1
& 2). Horesh et al. 2013 found a value of m which is marginally
consistent with the physically acceptable m obtained by Krauss
et al. 2012, (m ∼ 0.87 ± 0.07) and the former authors’ central
value of index m was biased on the higher side of unity which is
in an improbable dynamical regime given the asymptotic solution
due to Chevalier 1982a for a shock wave in medium set up by a
wind with constant mass loss rate, has the shock decelerating as
m = (n − 3)/(n − 2) < 1, where n is the index for ejecta density
proﬁle. A possible reason may be the change in the properties of
the blast wave or the electron population with time as the Horesh
et al. 2013 model is based on very early time data while Krauss
et al. 2012 model is based on slightly late time data. It is noted

MNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)

that the velocity of blastwave seems to have decreased with time
as expected for an interacting blast wave (shown in Figure 6). The
points are located between constant velocity lines corresponding to
2.5 × 109 cm s−1 and 3.0 × 109 cm s−1 at early time (< 58 days),
and thereafter (> 90 days) move towards lower values of velocity
of around 2.0 × 109 cm s−1. On the basis of early optical spectra
Arcavi et al. 2011a suggested that the supernovae had a compact
progenitor (R⋆ ∼ 1011 cm). Soderberg et al. 2012 also supported
the hypothesis with a compact progenitor star using the initial X-
ray and radio data. On the other hand, a slowed down shock as
found in the size estimates of the radio sphere based on synchrotron
spectra from early CARMA, VLA and our late time GMRT data is
consistent with a type eIIb classiﬁcation (Chevalier & Soderberg
2010). Also, the VLBI measurements of de Witt et al. 2016 con-
ﬁrms that by 453 days, the average expansion velocity was reduced
to 1.89 ± 0.28 × 109 cm s−1 (modulo a slightly diﬀerent smaller
distance of ∼ 7.8 Mpc). Also, type cIIb SNe show late time ra-
dio variability as for example in SN 2001ig (Ryder et al. 2004)
or SN 2003bg (Soderberg et al. 2006) which SN 2011dh did not
display. The fact that the GMRT radio data is also consistent with
evolution from the earlier VLA phase (albeit a shock speed change
between 58 to 92 days) points to the extended nature of type pro-
genitor rather than a compact Wolf-Rayet progenitor.

The residual blue point source found at the location of SN
2011dh could be due to a combination of the following four pos-
sible causes as pointed out by Maund et al. 2015, namely: a) a bin-
ary companion of the exploded supernova YSG progenitor, b) light
echo from dust around the SN position, c) SN 2011dh itself (either

8

Naveen Yadav et al.

due to Freeze-out in the Helium envelope or in combination with
radioactivity powered optical emission) and d) due to circumstel-
lar interaction of the SN. Maund et al. 2015 discard the light echo
scenario (case-b) due to the special arrangement of dust directly
behind the SN in the line of sight required to produce the point-like
residual source. They also use their Swift X-ray Telescope (XRT)
and VLA observations to argue against ongoing CSM interaction at
the time of late time HST observations. However, we note that their
5 ksec XRT exposure gives a 3σ upper limit of 1.2 × 1039 erg s−1
which is higher than the predicted X-ray luminosity (5×1037 erg s−1
at 500 days). (Soderberg et al. 2012) based on early Swift data and
the measured Chandra luminosity of 5.5 × 1037 erg s−1 which is
much lower even at 500 days (Maeda et al. 2014) i.e. half the age
of the SN considered by Maund et al. 2015. Therefore the X-ray
observations do not rule out any ongoing strong CSM interaction
continuing till 1164 days as claimed by Maund et al. 2015. They
further claim that their VLA observation on October 18, 2014 UT
(day 1236) which showed a radio ﬂux density of 459 ± 93 µJy in
the C-band (6.1 GHz) and 109 ± 17 µJy in the K-band (22 GHz)
are well within the expectations based on earlier VLA measure-
ments, assuming that the CSM has an extended wind-like structure.
As already argued here, the Horesh et al. 2013 predictions some-
what overestimate the optically thin part of the emission in the L-
band even during our GMRT observation epochs. In fact, with our
GMRT L-band (1.387 GHz) measurements on day 421, we would
expect about 230 µJy at 6.1 GHz and on day 1229 using Equa-
tion 12 & 13 which is about half of what has been reported. This,
together with the evidence of early slowing down of the shock both
in our GMRT data as well as in the long term average of VLBI
measurements show that the there is fairly strong ongoing CSM
interaction which may have even been enhanced by day 1229 and
must be contributing substantially in other bands (optical and UV
included) within the as yet point source. There is also evidence that
the nebular line proﬁles of SN 2011dh observed between 201 and
678 days show a roughly spherical explosion with a few aspher-
ical clumps and the SN is showing signs of strong CSM interaction
(Shivvers et al. 2013). However, the CSM interaction may decrease
with time if the circumstellar wind is roughly spherically symmet-
ric and with time may even be resolved if it continues to remain
strong.

A comparison with the prototypical type IIb SN 1993J which
had a considerable fraction of its hydrogen envelope stripped oﬀ
prior to explosion shows that SN 2011dh had less radio luminosity
at its peak and it evolved much more rapidly compared to SN 1993J
(see de Witt et al. 2016 for a comparison). This fast rise to peak of
the radio light curve as well as the low peak luminosity imply that
the CSM surrounding SN 2011dh was less dense than that for SN
1993J. There is thus variation of the properties of the environment
and past history of the progenitors of the same spectroscopic type
of SN.

7 CONCLUSIONS

We ﬁnd that the radio emission models based on early time data
(< 16 days) of SN 2011dh are not very suitable for predicting the
late time (> 100 days) radio ﬂux densities. This may be because
the parameters of the shock-CSM interaction may have varied over
time as exempliﬁed by e.g. the variation of shock wave velocity
with time. Such a hypothesis will be the scope of future investig-
ations in similar types of SNe. We note that the SN 2011dh has
many unsettled questions regarding binarity, mass and mass loss of

the progenitor which if probed will go a long way in helping us
understand supernovae and their progenitors in general.
