Transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) are essential to many technologies. These materials are
doped (n- or p-type) oxides with a large enough band gap (ideally >3 eV) to ensure transparency.
However, the high carrier concentration present in TCOs lead additionally to the possibility for
optical transitions from the occupied conduction bands to higher states for n-type materials and
from lower states to the unoccupied valence bands for p-type TCOs. The “second gap” formed by
these transitions might limit transparency and a large second gap has been sometimes proposed as
a design criteria for high performance TCOs. Here, we study the inﬂuence of this second gap on
optical absorption using ab initio computations for several well-known n- and p-type TCOs. Our
work demonstrates that most known n-type TCOs do not suﬀer from second gap absorption in the
visible even at very high carrier concentrations. On the contrary, p-type oxides show lowering of
their optical transmission for high carrier concentrations due to second gap eﬀects. We link this
dissimilarity to the diﬀerent chemistries involved in n- versus typical p-type TCOs. Quantitatively,
we show that second gap eﬀects lead to only moderate loss of transmission (even in p-type TCOs)
and suggest that a wide second gap, while beneﬁcial, should not be considered as a needed criteria
for a working TCO.

Transparent conducting materials are crucial for many
technologies (e.g., displays or thin-ﬁlm solar cells)[1, 2].
The exceptional combination of transparency to the visi-
ble light and high conductivity can be achieved by doping
large band gap oxides in order to form so-called trans-
parent conducting oxides (TCOs). A wide variety of n-
type and p-type doped oxides have been considered and
extensively studied [e.g., n-type: In2O3 doped with tin
(ITO)[3–7] and ZnO doped with aluminum (AZO)[8–11]
or p-type: SnO[12, 13] and CuAlO2[14, 15]]. While TCOs
are widespread nowadays, important eﬀorts are still un-
derway to discover new materials and to optimize the
current ones. This is especially the case for p-type TCOs
that are lagging behind the best n-type materials.

The properties of importance for a TCO are well-
known (transparency, mobility, high dopability) and can
be related to the fundamental electronic structure of the
oxide[4, 16, 17]. This has led to an important body of
computationally or chemically driven searches for good
TCOs candidates[12–14, 18–24]. Those studies have
highlighted a series of straightforward design criteria, or
necessary properties for a TCO: a large band gap (ide-
ally >3 eV), a low eﬀective mass (of electrons for n-type
and holes for p-type), and a high dopability[25–27]. To
achieve substantial conductivity, TCOs often present car-
rier concentrations on the order of 1021 cm−3. The ad-
ditional electrons or holes inserted into the conduction
band(CB) (for n-type TCOs) or the valence band(VB)
(for p-type TCOs) can lead to new optical transitions.
When interacting with incident photons, the electrons in
the CB of n-type TCOs can absorb photons and undergo

transitions to higher states as illustrated in the left panel
of Fig. 1. In a similar way, in p-type TCOs (right panel
of Fig. 1), the electrons in lower states can transition up
and recombine with the holes in the VB. Such second gap
transitions, may aﬀect signiﬁcantly the transparency of
TCOs, and therefore appear as another key criteria for
the design of transparent conductors.

In this paper, we investigate the inﬂuence of second gap
transitions on the transparency of TCOs. The absorp-
tion coeﬃcient is computed for various doping concentra-
tions in various well-known n-type (ZnO, In2O3, SnO2,
BaSnO3) and p-type TCOs (CuAlO2, SnO, LaCuOS,
ZnRh2O4). We show that, at large doping concentra-
tions, the transparency can be lowered by second gap
transitions and provide a quantitative estimate of the

magnitude of this eﬀect. We also point out a funda-
mental dissimilarity in second gap eﬀect in many p-type
TCOs compared to n-types. We relate this fundamental
contrast to the very diﬀerent type of chemistry present
in n- versus p-type TCOs.

We use the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzherof (HSE) hybrid
exchange-correlation functional as it is known to bet-
ter capture the electronic structure and especially the
band gap of semiconductors and insulators[28, 29]. Fol-
lowing previous works, we use a diﬀerent fraction a
of exact-exchange for each material in order to obtain
band gaps reproducing the experimental data: a=25%
for In2O3[7, 21, 30], BaSnO3[31], CuAlO2[20, 32], and
ZnRh2O4[33]; a=32% for SnO2[34] and SnO[35]; and
a=37.5% for ZnO[36]. For LaCuOS, we are not aware
of any previous HSE studies. So, we adopt a value of
a=25% which leads to a good agreement with exper-
imental data[37] (see supplementary material).
In or-
der to study the optical properties, we calculate, at dif-
ferent carrier concentrations, the frequency-dependent
dielectric tensor within the random-phase approxima-
tion (RPA)[38] by using the VASP code [39, 40] and
pymatgen[41] for post-treatment (more details in supple-
mentary material).

The selected n-type and p-type TCOs cover a diverse
range of chemistries. A series of information about these
compounds (such as formula, space group, type of dop-
ing, computed and experimental direct band gap, etc.)
is provided in Table I of supplementary material.
The computed absorption coeﬃcients at diﬀerent car-
rier concentrations (C=1018-1021 cm−3) of the selected
n-type materials (In2O3, ZnO, SnO2, and BaSnO3) are
reported in Fig. 2 (on the left side) together with the
corresponding band structures. Interestingly, increasing
the carrier concentration does not lead to any absorp-
tion in the visible range. Indeed, the second gap above
the CB is quite large, typically around 4 eV, and cannot
lead to contributions in the visible range. In fact, for the
highest carrier concentrations (C≥1020 cm−3), the opti-
cal gap for these n-type TCOs is even widened due to
the Moss-Burnstein eﬀect[42]. The right side of Fig. 2
shows the absorption for the selected p-type materials
(CuAlO2, LaCuOS, ZnRh2O4 and SnO). Signiﬁcant ab-
sorption appears at low energy as the hole concentration
increases. The eﬀect is particularly large for the highest
hole concentrations (C≥ 1020 cm−3). ZnRh2O4, CuAlO2
and LaCuOS all show second gap transitions at energies
lower than 3 eV. Among the p-type materials, only SnO
does not present a strong degradation of its transparency
when the carrier concentration is increased. Indeed, the
band structure of SnO shows a large second gap of about
4 eV.

The diﬀerence between n- and p-type TCOs is strik-
ing. The n-type materials tend to have large second gap
transitions that do not aﬀect transparency when doped.
In contrast, most p-type TCOs show signiﬁcant absorp-
tion in the visible range due to second gap transitions
with the notable exception of SnO. A quantitative esti-

2

mate of the eﬀect of the second gap on the transparency
is provided by the visible transmittance of a typical thin-
ﬁlm. Fig. 3 plots the transmittance for a 100-nm ﬁlm
depending on the carrier concentration. We assume here
no reﬂection of the incident light. The blue (red) lines
correspond to n-type (p-type) materials. As expected
from the computed absorption coeﬃcients, n-type TCOs
do not show any degradation of their VT when the car-
rier concentration increases. In contrast, the transmit-
tance of p-type TCOs is signiﬁcantly degraded. This is
the case for CuAlO2 and LaCuOS. The lower band gap
of ZnRh2O4 induces a degradation in the transmission
with doping but only in an energy window lower than
the visible light (in the near infra-red). Finally, SnO
shows an improvement in transparency due to its large
second gap combined with a Moss-Burnstein eﬀect. We
would like to stress that our analysis only takes into ac-
count direct inter-band transitions. Including also non-
direct intra-band transitions [43] would be signiﬁcantly
more computationally expensive. Moreover, we do not
consider the loss of transmission due to the possible con-
tribution of plasma reﬂectivity when carrier concentra-
tion is increased [2, 4]. Nevertheless, our study points
out to lower second gap transitions as one of the reasons
explaining why many p-type TCOs show a less favorable
trade-oﬀ between transparency and carrier concentration
than n-type materials do[44].

The dissimilitude between n- and p-type TCOs can be
traced back to the materials chemistry. Fig. 4 shows sim-
pliﬁed molecular orbital diagrams for the studied TCOs.
The corresponding projected band structures and bond-
ing analysis data are reported in the supplementary ma-
terial.
In n-type oxides (panel a), the second gap is
formed by M-s/O-s and M-s/O-p anti-bonding states
(with M=In, Sn or Zn) which have a large diﬀerence in
energy. BaSnO3 (panel b) is slightly diﬀerent with the
presence of a Ba-d non-bonding states but also provides
a wide second gap.

The p-type TCOs on the other hand (panels c to f)
show more complex orbital diagrams. The materials
based on transition metals (TM) have a valence band
maximum (VBM) formed by TM-d /O-p or TM-d /S-p
anti-bonding states (with TM=Cu or Rh). The second
gap is formed between the VBM and other TM-d /O-p,
or TM-d /S-p states that are very close in energy to this
VBM. This leads to small second gap transitions that can
be in the visible range. In contrast, SnO presents a very
diﬀerent character for its VBM (Sn-s/O-p) and no hy-
bridized d -states. Hence, it shows a much larger second
gap which is due to the larger hybridization of Sn-s/O-p
states compared to d states to O-p. This indicates that
the lower hole eﬀective mass obtained by M-s/O-p hy-
bridization is not only beneﬁcial for the mobility of this
compound but also for its second gap transitions. Our
analysis points out to an intrinsic limit to transition d -
metal-based compared to s-metal-based p-type TCOs as
they not only lead to higher eﬀective masses but also
present larger limitations in terms of second gap absorp-

gap” transitions. We studied a series of common n-type
and p-type TCOs. A very diﬀerent behavior is observed
between n- and p-type materials. The n-type TCOs
show high second gap transitions and do not lose
transparency when highly doped. On the contrary, most
p-type materials have second gap transitions lower than
3 eV which lead to a degradation of their transparency
when doped. We relate the asymmetry in behavior
between n- and p-type materials to their chemistry.
The lower second gap present in transition metal-based
p-type TCOs comes from the small energy diﬀerences
between metal-d/O-p hybridized states. Our results on
SnO, one of the rare non-transition metal-based p-type
TCO, indicates that using p-type TCOs relying on the
hybridization of O-p with metal s-states lead naturally
to higher second gap transitions that are less detrimental
to transparency. Our work also quantitatively estimates
the eﬀect of these second gap transitions and demon-
strates that, while it is beneﬁcial to select materials with
a high second gap (>3 eV ideally), the magnitude of the
eﬀect should not lead to making it a strict requirement
for TCO design.

tion.

We give a quantitative estimate of the eﬀect of the
second gap transitions (see Fig. 3). For a 100-nm ﬁlm,
the observable loss in transparency with carrier concen-
tration reached 10% at most (20% for a 200-nm ﬁlm)
and for the highest carrier concentrations (1020 cm−3 to
1021 cm−3). Therefore, a small second gap has a more
moderate eﬀect on transparency than the principal band
gap. This comes from the smaller amount of carriers
available in the small energy window corresponding to
the second gap. This suggests that, while beneﬁcial, a
high second gap should not be considered a necessary
condition for obtaining a working TCO.

In summary, we used ab initio calculations combined
with the rigid band approximation to study the eﬀect
of heavy doping on optical absorption through “second
