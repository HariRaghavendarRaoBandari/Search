Particle-hole symmetry without particle-hole symmetry in the quantum Hall eﬀect at

ν = 5/2.

Numerical results suggest that the quantum Hall eﬀect at ν = 5/2 is described by the Pfaﬃan or
anti-Pfaﬃan state in the absence of disorder and Landau level mixing. Those states are incompatible
with the observed transport properties of GaAs heterostructures, where disorder and Landau level
mixing are strong. We show that the recent proposal of a PH-Pfaﬃan topological order by Son is
consistent with all experiments. The absence of the particle-hole symmetry at ν = 5/2 is not an
obstacle to the existence of the PH-Pfaﬃan order since the order is robust to symmetry breaking.

One of the most interesting features of topological in-
sulators and superconductors is their surface behavior. A
great variety of gapless and topologically-ordered gapped
surface states have been proposed [1]. Such states are
anomalous, that is, they can only exist on the surface of
a 3D bulk system and not in a stand-alone ﬁlm. Finding
experimental realizations of exotic surface states proved
diﬃcult and most of them have remained theoretical pro-
posals. Thus, it came as a surprise when Son [2] argued
that one such exotic state [3], made of Dirac compos-
ite fermions with the particle-hole symmetry (PHS), has
long been observed experimentally in a two-dimensional
system:
the electron gas in the quantum Hall eﬀect
(QHE) with the ﬁlling factor ν = 1/2.

At ﬁrst sight, Son’s idea violates the fermion doubling
theorem [4]. However, the theorem does not apply to
interacting systems such as the one Son considered. Be-
sides, in contrast to the conditions of the doubling the-
orem, the action of PHS is nonlocal in QHE since it in-
volves ﬁlling a Landau level.
Interestingly, composite
Dirac fermions allow an explanation of the geometrical
resonance experiments [5] which the classic theory [6] of
the 1/2 state could not explain. In this paper we show
that a closely related idea [2] provides a natural expla-
nation of the observed phenomenology on the enigmatic
QHE plateau at ν = 5/2 in GaAs.

Cooper pairing of Dirac composite fermions in the s
channel results in a fractional QHE state dubbed PH-
Pfaﬃan [2], where “PH” stands for “particle-hole”. We
argue that the PH-Pfaﬃan topological order is present
on the QHE plateau at ν = 5/2. This might seem un-
likely because the particle-hole symmetry is violated by
the Landau level mixing (LLM) in the observed states of
the second Landau level in GaAs. Besides, numerics [10–
15] supports the Pfaﬃan [7] and anti-Pfaﬃan [8, 9] states
at ν = 5/2 even in the presence of PHS. At the same time,
the existing numerical work, which always neglects strong
disorder and typically neglects strong LLM, is not yet in
the position to explain the physics of the 5/2 state, as
is evidenced by a major discrepancy between numerical
and experimental energy gaps [16]. Note that a recent at-
tempt to incorporate LLM [15] into simulations led to the

manifestly wrong conclusion that the 5/2 state does not
exist at realistic LLM. There is also no conﬂict between
the PH-Pfaﬃan order and the absence of PHS at ν = 5/2
since topological orders in the fractional QHE are not
protected by symmetry. On the other hand, it turns out
that the PH-Pfaﬃan order naturally explains the exper-
imental data that could not be explained [17, 18] by the
Pfaﬃan and anti-Pfaﬃan hypotheses. Thus, the support
for the Pfaﬃan and anti-Pfaﬃan states from numerical
studies of simpliﬁed Hamiltonians with PHS opens an
intriguing possibility of “symmetry from no symmetry”:
the particle-hole Pfaﬃan order is stabilized by LLM and
impurities which break PHS.

Below we review the properties of the PH-Pfaﬃan state
and compare them with experiment. We also propose
new experimental probes. Besides QHE in GaAs, our
motivation comes from the possibility of new non-Abelian
states [19] in ZnO [20] and multilayer graphene [21, 22].

Most experiments probe edge physics. The edge theory
can be constructed from the bulk wave function accord-
ing to the bulk-edge correspondence [23]. We will take
the opposite route and deduce the PH-Pfaﬃan ground
state from the edge Lagrangian. The latter is ﬁxed by
symmetry considerations. We do not expect the ground
state to be invariant under PHS. Nevertheless, its topo-
logical order must be compatible with such a symmetry
because our system is in the same phase as the particle-
hole symmetric superﬂuid built by Cooper paring of Son’s
composite fermions. In particular, the electric and ther-
mal Hall conductances are determined by the topological
order and hence must be invariant to the particle-hole
conjugation.

As usual, we ignore the ﬁlled states of the ﬁrst Lan-
dau level. The particle-hole conjugation then demands
reversing the directions of all edge modes and adding an-
other integer edge mode with the Hall conductance e2/h
and the thermal conductance π2k2
BT /3h. It thus follows
from symmetry that the electric and thermal conduc-
tances of the PH-system must be one half of the above
expressions: G = e2/2h and κ = π2k2
BT /6h. This cor-
responds to an edge theory with a downstream charged
Bose-mode whose thermal conductance is 2κ and an up-

stream Majorana fermion whose thermal conductance is
one half that of a Bose mode. The Lagrangian density

the topological charge α = 1, σ or ψ. The phase depends
on the fusion channel β of the topological charges α and
σ and equals

2

L = −

4π

[∂tφ∂xφ + vc(∂xφ)2] + iψ(∂t − vn∂x)ψ,

(1)

where the chiral Bose-ﬁeld φ propagates with the veloc-
ity vc and determines the charge density on the edge ac-
cording to ρ(x) = e∂xφ/2π. The neutral chiral Majorana
fermion ψ = ψ† travels in the direction opposite to that
of the Bose-mode. The action (1) is very similar to the
edge theory of the Pfaﬃan state [24] and diﬀers only by
the propagation direction of the neutral mode.

Many ground-state wave functions correspond to the
same low-energy edge theory (1). They depend on details
of impurities and LLM in a particular sample. We use
the generalized Moore-Read prescription [25] to write an
example of a wave function with the PH-Pfaﬃan topolog-
ical order. A topological order in the ﬁrst Landau level
is encoded by a simpler wave function than the same or-
der in the second level. To facilitate a comparison with
the literature on possible 5/2 states [26] we write a wave
function for electrons in the ﬁrst Landau level:

Ψ({zi}) = Z {d2ξi}h{zi}|{ξi}iΦ({ξi}),

(2)

where zk = xk + iyk and ξk are complex coordinates,
h{zi}|{ξi}i = Πi exp[−(|ξi|2 − 2 ¯ξizi + |zi|2)/(4l2
B)] is the
coherent state kernel that projects the wave function into
the lowest Landau level, lB is the magnetic length and
the bar denotes complex conjugation. The factor Φ is the
correlation function [25] of the electron operators Ψe =
ψ(x) exp(2iφ(x)) in the conformal ﬁeld theory (1):

Φ({ξi}) = Pf(cid:26) 1

¯ξi − ¯ξj(cid:27) Πi<j(ξi − ξj)2.

(3)

Our choice of the electron operator determines the shift
[27, 28] S = χ(hz − h¯z), where χ is the Euler character-
stics of the surface that conﬁnes electrons, and hz and h¯z
are the scaling dimensions of the holonomic and antiholo-
nomic parts of the electron operator Ψe. Thus, S = 1 on
a sphere in agreement with Son [2].

Quasiparticles braid trivially with electrons and are
created by the same operators as in the Pfaﬃan the-
ory [24]. There are six superselection sectors: vac-
uum 1, neutral fermion ψ, two charge-e/2 excitations
exp(iφ) and ψ exp(iφ), and two non-Abelian quasipar-
ticles σ exp(iφ/2) and σ exp(3iφ/2) with charges e/4 and
3e/4, where the operator σ twists the boundary condi-
tions for the Majorana fermion. The fusion rules are
ψ × ψ = 1, ψ × σ = σ and σ × σ = 1 + ψ. The braiding
rules are diﬀerent from the Pfaﬃan state. We will need
the statistical phase, picked up by an e/4-particle after it
encircles an excitation with the electric charge ne/4 and

φ =

+ φ′

αβ,

(4)

where φ′

1σ = 0, φ′

ǫσ = π, φ′

σ1 = π/4 and φ′

σǫ = −3π/4.

The particle-hole conjugation changes the signs of all
statistical phases mod 2π. One easily veriﬁes that the
above fusion and braiding rules are compatible with PHS.
For example, one can use the invariance of the braid-
ing phase under a simultaneous change of the signs of
all electric charges. Next, one observes that all phases
change their signs mod 2π after the excitations exp(iφ)
and ψ exp(iφ) transform into each other while all other
superselection sectors remain unchanged (remember that
π = −π mod 2π).
We now turn to comparison with experiment. The
experiment [29] revealed an upstream neutral mode on
the 5/2 edge. Upstream modes can be either topolog-
ically protected, as at ν = 2/3, or emerge from edge
reconstruction, as at ν = 1/3. The observed propagation
length of the neutral mode at ν = 5/2 is comparable with
the propagation length at ν = 2/3 and much longer [30]
than at ν = 1/3. Thus, the 5/2 upstream mode is topo-
logically protected. This agrees with the Lagrangian (1).
The anti-Pfaﬃan state also has topologically protected
upstream modes. The Pfaﬃan order appears incompati-
ble with the experiment.

Next, consider experiments on quasiparticle tunnel-
ing through narrow constrictions [18, 31, 32]. Tun-
neling is dominated by the lowest-charge quasiparticles
σ exp(iφ/2). Theory [23, 26] predicts the power depen-
dence of the zero-bias conductance on the temperature:
G ∼ T 2g−2 with a universal exponent g. The exponent
g = 1/4 is the same in the PH-Pfaﬃan and Pfaﬃan
states [26]. The anti-Pfaﬃan order corresponds [26] to
g = 1/2. Experimental results for g exceed [18, 26, 33, 34]
the theoretical values at all fractional ﬁlling factors [35].
This is explained by a combination of three mechanisms
that suppress low-temperature tunneling: Coulomb re-
pulsion across the constriction [26, 34], edge reconstruc-
tion [36, 37] and dissipation [38]. Hence, experiments can
only give an upper bound on g. At ν = 5/2 that bound
[18, 31, 32] is 0.4. Thus, the PH-Pfaﬃan state is compat-
ible with the tunneling data and the anti-Pfaﬃan state
is not. We observe that the transport data exclude both
the Pfaﬃan and anti-Pfaﬃan states. The PH-Pfaﬃan
topological order agrees with the existing experiments.

One interpretation of the Fabry-P´erot interference ex-
periment [39] at ν = 5/2 is based on the even-odd
topological eﬀect [40, 41], predicted for the Pfaﬃan and
anti-Pfaﬃan states. The same even-odd eﬀect occurs in
the PH-Pfaﬃan state.
Indeed, the magnetic ﬂux de-
pendence of the current through a Fabry-P´erot device,

Fig. 1, comes from the interference of the quasiparti-
cle paths through the two constrictions. Such interfer-
ence is present whenever an even number of σ exp(iφ/2)-
quasiparticles is localized inside the device. If the num-
ber is odd, the tunneling quasiparticle can fuse with the
topological charge α of the interferometer in two ways.
In both fusion channels β, the phase diﬀerence φ(β) be-
tween the two trajectories is given by the braiding phase
(4). Since the phases (4) diﬀer by π in the two fusion
channels, there is no interference and the even-odd eﬀect
is observed.

In common with the Pfaﬃan and anti-Pfaﬃan states,
we expect the PH-Pfaﬃan topological order to occur in a
spin-polarized electron liquid. The existing data on the
polarization of the 5/2 liquid are controversial. A recent
observation of the 5/2 plateau in ZnO strengthens the
case for nonzero polarization [20].

What new experiments could probe the PH-Pfaﬃan or-
der? First, the thermal Hall conductance κ = π2k2
BT /6h
in the PH-Pfaﬃan state diﬀers from all other proposed
topological orders. A more striking manifestation of the
PH-Pfaﬃan state comes from Mach-Zehnder interferom-
etry [42–46] which we address below. We discover two
unique signatures of the PH-Pfaﬃan order: the current
through the interferometer does not depend on the mag-
netic ﬁeld; the Fano factor for the current noise diverges
at some values of the magnetic ﬁeld. Neither feature is
known to occur in any other QHE state at any ﬁlling
factor.

Quasiparticles can tunnel between the inner and outer
edges of the Mach-Zehnder interferometer, Fig. 2, at
quantum point contacts QPC1 and QPC2. After a tun-
neling event, a quasiparticle/hole travels along the in-
ner edge and is absorbed by drain D2. The drain is in-
side the interferometer. As a result, the total topological
charge, accumulated in the drain, aﬀects the probability
of the next tunneling event. Indeed, the phase diﬀerence
between the two possible tunneling processes through
QPC1 and QPC2 depends on the statistical phase φs,
accumulated when a quasiparticle encircles the drain.
The tunneling probability also depends on the Aharonov-
Bohm phase φAB, accumulated on the loop QPC1-A-
QPC2-B-QPC1. Since tunneling is dominated by e/4-

3

particles, the phase φAB = πΦ/2Φ0, where Φ is the mag-
netic ﬂux through the loop QPC1-A-QPC2-B-QPC1 and
Φ0 = hc/e is the ﬂux quantum.

To compute the tunneling probabilities we use the

Hamiltonian of the interferometer

ˆH = ˆHinner + ˆHouter + ˆT1 + ˆT2,

(5)

where ˆHinner and ˆHouter are the Hamiltonians of the two
edges and the operators ˆT1,2 describe quasiparticle tun-
neling at QPC1 and QPC2. The four terms on the right
hand side of Eq. (5) depend on the gauge choice. We
select such a gauge for the electromagnetic ﬁeld that
all information about the Aharonov-Bohm phase φAB is
contained in the tunneling operator ˆT2. All information
about the statistical phase φs is also absorbed into ˆT2.
Thus, we select the tunneling operators in the form

ˆT1 = Γ1Ψq
ˆT2 = Γ1 exp(iφAB + iφs)Ψq

outer(QPC1)Ψq†
outer(QPC2)Ψq†

inner(QPC1) + h.c.,(6)
inner(QPC2) + h.c.,(7)

where h.c. stays for the Hermitian conjugate and the op-
erators Ψq
edge destroy quasiparticles of charge e/4 on the
inner/outer edge at the locations of the quantum point
contacts.

We will restrict our discussion to the zero-temperature
limit, where charge only travels from the higher to lower
potential. We thus assume that quasiparticles can only
tunnel from the outer edge to the inner edge. The tunnel-
ing probability P (ne/4, α, β) = uαβP β(ne/4, α), where
ne/4 and α are the electric and topological charges of
drain D2 before tunneling, β is the fusion channel of α
with the tunneling quasiparticle, uαβ is the probability of
the fusion outcome β, and P (ne/4, α, β) is the tunneling
probability in the fusion channel β. uσ1 = uσǫ = 1/2.
The fusion probabilities of all other possible processes
equal 1. The probability P β can be found from the sec-
ond order perturbation theory in ˆT1,2:

P β(ne/4, α) = r{|Γ1|2+|Γ2|2+2u|Γ1Γ2| cos(φAB+φs+γ)},
(8)
where γ = arg[Γ2/Γ1], and r and u come from the
voltage-dependent correlation functions of the quasipar-
ticle operators in the edge theory with the unperturbed

¯hvc/L, ¯hvn/L, where L is the interferometer size, the
factor u ≈ 1 since the distance between QPC1 and QPC2
can be neglected in the calculation of the correlation
functions.
It is convenient to label the possible values
of P β(ne/4, α) as p0, pπ/2, pπ, and p−π/2 depending on
φs = 0, π/2, π, or −π/2. Fig. 3 shows all the possible
transitions between the 6 superselection sectors of the
drain.

We are ready to compute the current I between S1
and D2. Be deﬁnition, I = Q/t, where Q = N e is the
charge, transmitted through the interferometer during a
long time interval t. At large N, the interval t ≈ N ¯t,
where ¯t is the average time of four consecutive tunneling
events. Since each tunneling event transfers charge e/4,
one ﬁnds I = e/¯t.

The system follows the arrows in Fig. 3. Hence, the
drain always returns to the initial superselection sec-
tor (−e/4, σ) after four quasiparticles tunnel. This can
happen in one of the four ways: (−e/4, σ) → (0, 1) →
(e/4, σ) → (e/2, 1) → (−e/4, σ), (−e/4, σ) → (0, ψ) →
(e/4, σ) → (e/2, 1) → (−e/4, σ), (−e/4, σ) → (0, 1) →
(e/4, σ) → (e/2, ψ) → (−e/4, σ), (−e/4, σ) → (0, ψ) →
(e/4, σ) → (e/2, ψ) → (−e/4, σ). The average time
¯t = P qi¯ti, where qi are the probabilities and ¯ti are the
average times for the above four trajectories. For exam-
ple, the probability of the ﬁrst trajectory is p0/[p0 +pπ]×
pπ/2/[pπ/2 + p−π/2]. The average travel time along that
trajectory is 2/(p0+pπ)+1/p0+2/(pπ/2+p−π/2)+1/pπ/2.
One ﬁnds the electric current

The current does not depend on the magnetic ﬂux
through the interferometer.

We next compute the low-frequency current noise S =
R ∞
−∞ dt[h ˆI(0) ˆI(t) + ˆI(t) ˆI(0)i − 2h ˆI(0)i2]. It can be con-
veniently represented as S = 2hδQ2i/[N ¯t], where δQ is
the ﬂuctuation of the charge, transmitted during the in-
terval of time N ¯t, and the angular brackets denote the
average over all the realizations of the noise. To ﬁnd
δQ for a particular realization, we deﬁne tN = N ¯t + ∆t

4

as the time during which the charge N e is transferred.
Then the charge, transmitted during the time N ¯t, equals
Q ≈ N e − I∆t with I from Eq. (9). Hence, δQ = −I∆t
and S = 2I 2h∆t2i/[N ¯t]. Observe that ∆t ∼ √N . Thus,
S = 2I 2δt2/¯t, where δt2 is the mean square ﬂuctuation
of the time required for 4 consecutive tunneling events.
The latter ﬂuctuation is computed in the same way as ¯t.
One ﬁnds S = 2e∗I with the Fano factor

where i runs over the set {0, π/2, π,−π/2} and s =

in a symmetric interferometer with |Γ1| = |Γ2|. Then
the Fano factor e∗ = e/[1 − cos(2πΦ/Φ0 + 4γ)] diverges
at Φ = [n − 2γ/π]Φ0.
The 113 topological order [17] can also explain the ob-
served upstream neutral mode and tunneling exponent.
The explanation, based on the PH-Pfaﬃan state, has two
advantages. First, the quantization of the Hall conduc-
tance in the 113 state depends on an edge equilibra-
tion mechanism. Any such mechanism fails at a suf-
ﬁciently low temperature but no signiﬁcant deviations
from G = 5e2/2h at low temperatures have been reported
in the literature. At the same time, the conductance of
the PH-Pfaﬃan state remains quantized arbitrarily close
to absolute zero. Besides, an elegant combination of sym-
metry and non-Abelian statistics makes the PH-Pfaﬃan
order aesthetically appealing.

In conclusion, the PH-Pfaﬃan order is consistent with
all the transport experiments at ν = 5/2. Numerical
support for the Pfaﬃan and anti-Pfaﬃan states in sim-
pliﬁed systems without disorder and LLM suggests an
interesting possibility of “symmetry from no symmetry”.
A smoking gun evidence of such an eﬀect would come
from a unique behavior in Mach-Zehnder interferometry.
