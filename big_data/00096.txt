Temperature and voltage measurement in quantum systems far from equilibrium

Department of Physics, University of Arizona, 1118 East Fourth Street, Tucson, AZ 85721

We show that a local measurement of temperature and voltage for a quantum system in steady
state, arbitrarily far from equilibrium, with arbitrary interactions within the system, is unique when
it exists. This is interpreted as a consequence of the second law of thermodynamics. We further
derive a necessary and suﬃcient condition for the existence of a solution. In this regard, we ﬁnd
that a positive temperature solution exists whenever there is no net population inversion. However,
when there is a net population inversion, we may characterize the system with a unique negative
temperature. Voltage and temperature measurements are treated on an equal footing: They are
simultaneously measured in a noninvasive manner, via a weakly-coupled thermoelectric probe, deﬁned
by requiring vanishing charge and heat dissipation into the probe. Our results strongly suggest that
a local temperature measurement without a simultaneous local voltage measurement, or vice-versa,
is a misleading characterization of the state of a nonequilibrium quantum electron system. These
results provide a ﬁrm mathematical foundation for voltage and temperature measurements far from
equilibrium.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Scanning probe microsopy [1–5] revolutionized the ﬁeld
of nanoscience and enabled the measurement of local
thermodynamic observables such as voltage [6] and tem-
perature [7] in nonequilibrium quantum systems. The
ability to deﬁne local thermodynamic variables in a sys-
tem far from equilibrium is of fundamental interest be-
cause it is a necessary step toward the construction of
nonequilibrium thermodynamics [8–15]. Many experi-
ments in mesoscopic electrical transport utilize voltage
probes as circuit elements [16–19], and scanning poten-
tiometers are now a mature technology [20–22], routinely
achieving sub-angstrom spatial resolution to study a host
of novel physical phenomena [23–26]. In contrast, scan-
ning thermometry [7] has proven signiﬁcantly more chal-
lenging [27], but is currently undergoing a rapid evo-
lution toward nanometer resolution [28–31], leading to
important insights into transport and dissipation at the
nanoscale [32–36]. A fundamental challenge for theory is
to develop a rigorous mathematical description of such
local thermodynamic measurements. Until now, mainly
operational deﬁnitions [12, 37–46] have been advanced,
leading to a competing panoply of often contradictory
deﬁnitions of such basic observables as temperature and
voltage.

The second law of thermodynamics is one of the corner-
stones of physics. The origin of the second law was rooted
in empirical observations in the early nineteeth century,
and its theoretical explanation emerged with the gradual
development of the statistical foundation of thermody-
namics. The statistical basis of the second law places it
in a league of its own, among the laws of physics. A quote
on the subject, at once exalting and to the point, by the
famous astrophysicist Sir Arthur Eddington reads as fol-
lows [47]: “The law that entropy always increases holds,
I think, the supreme position among the laws of Nature.
If someone points out to you that your pet theory of the
universe is in disagreement with Maxwell’s equations —

If it
then so much the worse for Maxwell’s equations.
is found to be contradicted by observation — well, these
experimentalists do bungle things sometimes. But if your
theory is found to be against the second law of thermo-
dynamics I can give you no hope; there is nothing for
it but to collapse in deepest humiliation.” Any theory
which purports to describe the measurement of tempera-
ture, voltage or other thermodynamic parameters, must
therefore satisfy this fundamental requirement, and as
Eddington notes, regardless of the nature of microscopic
interactions.

We examine statements of the second law of thermo-
dynamics, accompanied with mathematical proofs, and
their consequences, in the context of local noninvasive
measurements of temperature and voltage in nonequi-
librium quantum electron systems. We derive our re-
sults from very general considerations, i.e., for electron
transport in steady state, arbitrarily far from equilib-
rium, and for arbitrary interactions within the quantum
electron system. Our considerations apply to any system
of fermions, charged or neutral. While our analyses in
this article are presented in a theorem-proof format, their
motivation draws from physical principles. We show that
the uniqueness of the temperature and voltage measure-
ment is a consequence of the second law of thermodynam-
ics and that, in order to obtain a unique measurement, it
is necessary to measure both temperature and voltage si-
multaneously. Simply put, this is because electrons carry
both energy and charge.

In order to have a meaningful deﬁnition of tempera-
ture, the Hamiltonian must be bounded below (hHi ≥ −c
for some ﬁnite c ∈ R). By the same token, a system can,
in principle, exhibit negative temperatures if the energy
averaged over the spectrum is bounded above (hHi ≤ c
for some ﬁnite c ∈ R). These are well-known results
in statistical physics, and we highlight their role in the
context of local noninvasive measurements of tempera-
ture and voltage. We derive a condition, that is both
necessary and suﬃcient, for the existence of a joint tem-

perature and voltage measurement. This condition cor-
responds physically to a nonequilibrium system that does
not exhibit local population inversion. We obtain also,
as a corollary of the former condition, the result that
nonequilibrium systems exhibiting local population in-
version can be characterized with a negative temperature
which is also unique. Population inversion is the working
principle behind important Fermionic devices such as the
maser and laser [48–51].

In this article, we consider a probe that couples ex-
clusively to the electronic degrees of freedom. Out of
equilibrium, the temperature distributions of diﬀerent
microscopic degrees of freedom (e.g., electrons, phonons,
nuclear spins) do not, in general, coincide, so that one
has to distinguish between measurements of the electron
temperature [37, 38, 44, 52] and the lattice temperature
[53, 54]. This distinction is particularly acute in the ex-
treme limit of elastic quantum transport [55], where elec-
tron and phonon temperatures are completely decoupled.
It should be emphasized that the electrons within the sys-
tem are free to undergo arbitrary interactions, e.g., with
photons, phonons, other electrons, etc. However, direct
heat transport into the probe via black-body radiation,
phonons, etc. is excluded. Inclusion of these additional
heat transfer processes into the probe leads to a tem-
perature measurement that is simply a combination of
the temperatures of the various microscopic degrees of
freedom [45].

The article is organised as follows. We outline the for-
malism in Sec. II, and introduce a postulate that helps
put our results on sound mathematical footing. In Sec.
III, we discuss our theory of local thermodynamic mea-
surements, explain the idea behind noninvasive measure-
ments, and also derive some useful expressions for further
analysis. In Sec. IV, we provide several statements of the
second law of thermodynamics and show their relation
to the uniqueness of temperature and voltage measure-
ments.
In Sec. V, we start by deﬁning certain useful
quantities and proceed to derive the condition for the
existence of a solution. We also discuss here the case of
broadband probes in order to further illustrate the physi-
cal meaning behind our results, and conclude that probes
operating in the broadband limit can be considered to be
ideal. We consider the other extreme as well, i.e., nar-
rowband probes and conclude that they are unsuitable for
measurements. Our results are illustrated for a two-level
system which is detailed in Sec. V D. We conclude with
a summary of our central ﬁndings in Sec. VI, contrast-
ing our approach to prior theoretical work, and discuss
possible future directions. Some key results on the local
properties of fermions in a nonequilibrium steady state
are presented in Appendix A, which are needed in our
analysis of the measurement problem.

II. FORMALISM

2

We use the nonequilibrium Green’s function formalism
(NEGF) for describing the motion of electrons within
a quantum conductor. A general expression for the
nonequilibrium steady-state electrical current (ν = 0)
[56] and the electronic contribution to the heat current
(ν = 1) [57] ﬂowing into a macroscopic electron reservoir
P , can be written in a form analogous to the two-terminal
Landauer-B¨uttiker formula [13]:

I (ν)
p =

1

hZ ∞

−∞

dω(ω − µp)νTps(ω)[fs(ω) − fp(ω)],

with ν = {0, 1},

where one may think of

Tps(ω) = 2π Tr {Γp(ω)A(ω)}

(1)

(2)

as a local transmission function between the macroscopic
probe terminal and the nonequilibrium quantum system.
fs(ω) is the nonequilibrium distribution function of the
system, as sampled by the probe, and is deﬁned by [13]

fs(ω) ≡

Tr {Γp(ω)G<(ω)}
2πi Tr {Γp(ω)A(ω)}

.

(3)

In Eqs. (2–3), A(ω) =(cid:0)G<(ω) − G>(ω)(cid:1)/2πi is the spec-

tral function. G<(ω) and G>(ω) are the Fourier trans-
forms of the Keldysh “lesser” and “greater” Green’s func-
tions [58], describing the nonequilibrium electron and
hole distributions within the system, respectively (see
Appendix A for details). Γp(ω) is the tunneling width
matrix describing the coupling of the probe to the system,

and fp(ω; µp, Tp) = 1/(cid:0)1+exp( ω−µp

distribution of the probe. We note that the expression
in Eq. (1) is completely general and allows for arbitrary
interactions within the quantum system, and arbitrary
bias conditions of the reservoirs.

Tps(ω) ≥ 0, ∀ω ∈ R.

We note that fs(ω) satisﬁes the property of a distribu-

tion function, namely,

0 ≤ fs(ω) ≤ 1 ∀ω ∈ R,

(6)

as shown in appendix A. We start our analysis with the
following postulate, and explain its physical signiﬁcance.

Postulate 1 The local probe-system transmission
function Tps : R → [0, ∞) and the nonequilibrium dis-
tribution function fs : R → [0, 1] are measurable over
any interval [a, b] ∈ R, and Tps(ω) satisﬁes

The measurability of Tps(ω) and fs(ω) is taken to lend
meaning to the currents in Eq. (1). We point out that
the ﬁniteness of the two integrals given in Eqs. (7) and
(8) is more relevant to our discussion of existence in Sec.
V. Our result on uniqueness, as stated in Theorem 2, is
somewhat stronger and requires only that the function
Tps(ω) grow slower than exponentially for large values of
energy (for ω → ±∞).

On physical grounds, the probe-sample transmission
function Tps(ω) can be argued to have a compact support
(non-zero only for some ﬁnite interval [ω−, ω+] ⊂ R). It
is easy to see that Tps must have a lower bound ω− such
that Tps(ω) = 0 ∀ ω < ω−, since physical Hamiltonians
must have a ﬁnite ground-state energy. However, for en-
ergies larger than the probe work function (ω+), it can
be argued that the particle will merely pass through the
probe and not contribute to the steady state currents into
the probe. Tps(ω) then has a compact support and sat-
isﬁes Eqs. (7) and (8). In section V, we comment upon
the limiting case where the measure of ωTps(ω) in Eq. (8)
tends to inﬁnity. The absolute value on the lhs in Eq. (8)
is somewhat redundant since the limiting case must have
ω+ → ∞ while ω− → −∞ is ruled out based on the prin-
ciple that any physical spectrum has a ﬁnite ground-state
energy. We note that Eqs. (7), (8) also imply

III. LOCAL MEASUREMENTS

The local voltage and temperature of a nonequilibrium
quantum system, as measured by a scanning thermoelec-
tric probe, is deﬁned by the simultaneous conditions of
vanishing net charge dissipation and vanishing net heat
dissipation into the probe [13, 15, 44, 45, 52, 60]:

I (ν)
p = 0,

ν ∈ {0, 1},

(11)

FIG. 1: Illustration of the measurement setup: The
quantum conductor represented below is in a
nonequilibrium steady state. A weakly-coupled
scanning tunneling probe noninvasively measures the
local voltage (µp) and local temperature (Tp)
simultaneously: By requiring both a vanishing net
charge exchange (I (0)
p = 0)and a vanishing net heat
exchange (I (1)
nonequilibrium steady state has been prepared, in this
particular illustration, via the electrical and thermal
bias of the strongly-coupled reservoirs (1 and 2). The
measurement method itself is completely general and
does not depend upon (a) how such a nonequilibrium
steady-state is prepared, (b) how far from equilibrium
the quantum electron system is driven, and (c) the
nature of interactions within that system.

p = 0) with the system. The

where ν = 0, 1 correspond to the electron number cur-
rent and the electronic contribution to the heat current,
respectively. Eq. (11) gives the conditions under which
the probe is in local equilibrium with the sample, which
is itself arbitrarily far from equilibrium.

We deﬁne the system’s local temperature and voltage
using a probe that is weakly coupled via a tunnel barrier.
The other end of this scanning probe [4, 5] is the macro-
scopic electron reservoir whose temperature and voltage
are both adjusted until Eq. (11) is satisﬁed. A weakly
coupled probe is a useful theoretical construction for our
analysis, and the extension of our results beyond the
weak-coupling limit is an open question. We explain the
physical basis of weak coupling below, and derive some
useful formulae.

A. Noninvasive measurements

When the coupling of the probe to the system is weak,
we may take Tps(ω) in Eq. (2) and the local nonequilib-
rium distribution function fs(ω) to be independent of the
probe Fermi-Dirac distribution fp(ω). While both these

quantities depend upon the local probe-system coupling
in an obvious manner, the weak-coupling condition essen-
tially implies that the nonequilibrium steady state of the
system is unperturbed by the introduction of the probe
terminal. The voltage and temperature of the probe it-
self play no role in preparing the nonequilibrium steady
state. In other words, the probe does not drive the sys-
tem but merely exchanges energy and particles across a
weakly-coupled tunnel barrier and constitutes a nonin-
vasive measurement.

Given a system prepared in a certain nonequilibrium
steady state (e.g., by a particular bias of the strongly cou-
pled reservoirs), the currents given by Eq. (1) are func-
tions of the probe Fermi-Dirac distribution speciﬁed by
its temperature and chemical potential

I (ν)
p ≡ I (ν)

p (µp, Tp).

(12)

It can be seen that the currents are continuous func-
tions of µp ∈ (−∞, ∞) and Tp ∈ (0, ∞) with continuous
gradient vector ﬁelds deﬁned by

∇I (ν)

p ≡(cid:18) ∂I (ν)

p
∂µp

,

p

∂I (ν)

∂Tp (cid:19).

(13)

With kB set to unity, we compute the gradients of the
currents using Eq. (1). We ﬁnd the gradient of the num-
ber current to be

∇I (0)

p =(cid:18) − L(0)

ps , −

L(1)
ps

The gradient of the heat current reduces to

∇I (1)

−∞

dω(ω − µp)ν Tps(ω)(cid:18) −

∂fp

∂ω(cid:19),

(16)

which are easily seen to be ﬁnite [61].

Although the coeﬃcients L(ν)
ps

formally resemble the
Onsager linear-response coeﬃcients [62] of an elastic
quantum conductor [63], it is very important to note that
we do not make the assumptions of linear response, local
equilibrium, or elastic transport in the above deﬁnition of
L(ν)
ps : The system itself may be arbitrarily far from equi-
librium with arbitrary inelastic scattering processes. The
coeﬃcients above appear naturally when we calculate the
gradient ﬁelds deﬁned by Eq. (13), and the gradient oper-
ator is of course given by the ﬁrst derivatives. Our main
results follow from an analysis of the properties of these
gradient ﬁelds.

IV. UNIQUENESS AND THE SECOND LAW

We now turn to one of the central problems which we
set out to address: I (ν)
p (µp, Tp) = 0, with ν = {0, 1}, is
a system of coupled nonlinear equations in two variables
that deﬁnes our local voltage and temperature measure-
ment. There is no a priori reason to expect a unique
solution, if a solution exists at all. We begin the sec-
tion with statements of the second law of thermodynam-
ics, and conclude by showing that the uniqueness of the
measurement emerges as a consequence.

A. Statements of the second law

We note that ∀ µp ∈ (−∞, ∞) and Tp ∈ (0, ∞),

L(0)
L(2)

ps (µp, Tp) > 0
ps (µp, Tp) > 0,

(17)

since Tps(ω) ≥ 0, and the measure of Tps(ω) and the
Fermi-function derivative are both nonzero and strictly
positive. This leads to two statements of the second law
of thermodynamics, related to the Clausius statement,
which are presented in the following two lemmas. The
idea is to choose the correct contour for each case, and
to evaluate the line integral over the current gradients
in Eqs. (14) and (15). A cursory glance at the number
current gradient in Eq. (14) suggests that the contour
should be deﬁned over a constant temperature, while the
heat current gradient in Eq. (15) suggests a line integral
over a constant voltage contour.

Lemma 1 The number current contour deﬁned by
I (0)
p (µp, Tp) = 0 exists for all Tp ∈ (0, ∞) and deﬁnes
a function M : (0, ∞) → R where µp = M (Tp), such that
the second law of thermodynamics is obeyed:

I (0)
p (µ′
I (0)
p (µ′

p, Tp) > 0, if µ′
p, Tp) < 0, if µ′

p < M (Tp) and
p > M (Tp).

(18)

Proof. We ﬁrst show that I (0)(µp, Tp) = 0 is satisﬁed for
all Tp ∈ (0, ∞). For any Tp ∈ (0, ∞), we have

This implies the existence of a unique solution to
I (0)
p (µp, Tp) = 0 for every Tp ∈ (0, ∞) which we denote
by µp = M (Tp), and Eq. (18) is implied by Eq. (22). (cid:4)

We also note that the number current [µp = M (Tp)]
contour is vertical when the temperature approaches ab-
solute zero, as shown in Fig. 2, since L(1)
ps /Tp → 0 as

5

Tp → 0, and implies a vanishing Seebeck coeﬃcient for
the probe-system junction near absolute zero.

An “ideal potentiometer” was initially proposed [37] by
merely requiring I (0)
p = 0. Subsequently, B¨uttiker [64, 65]
clariﬁed that this deﬁnition holds only near absolute zero
due to the absence of thermoelectric corrections. Such a
voltage probe determines the voltage uniquely at zero
temperature in the linear response regime, and is rele-
vant for experiments in mesoscopic circuits [16–19] which
are carried out at cryogenic temperatures. However, at
higher temperatures and/or larger bias voltages, where
the sample may be heated by both the Joule and Peltier
eﬀects, thermoelectric corrections to voltage measure-
ments must be considered. Indeed, Bergﬁeld and Staﬀord
[60] argue that an ideal voltage probe must be required to
equilibrate thermally with the system (I (1)
p = 0), with-
out which “a voltage will develop across the system-probe
junction due to the Seebeck eﬀect.”

Voltage probes have been used extensively in the theo-
retical literature to mimic the eﬀects of various scattering
processes, such as inelastic scattering [64, 66–70] and de-
phasing [71–73] in mesoscopic systems. A modern vari-
ation of B¨uttiker’s voltage probe, additionally requiring
that the probe exchange no heat current, has been used
to model inelastic scattering in quantum transport prob-
lems at ﬁnite temperature [39, 42, 74–76]. The probe
technique, as a model for scattering, has also been exten-
sively studied beyond the linear response regime [77–79].
Lemma 1 implies that a “voltage probe” (deﬁned only
by I (0)
p = 0) requires the simultaneous speciﬁcation of a
probe temperature Tp so that µp = M (Tp) is uniquely
determined. Fig. 2 illustrates that the measured volt-
age shows a large dependence on the probe temperature.
Therefore, it is important to deﬁne a simultaneous tem-
perature measurement by imposing I (1)
Lemma 2 The heat current contour deﬁned by
I (1)
p (µp, Tp) = c, where c is some constant, obeys the

p (µp, Tp) = 0.

p > Tp.

(23)

Proof. We follow an analogous argument to lemma 1, and
show the monotonicity of I (1)
p (µp, Tp) along a certain con-
tour in the µp-Tp plane. Naturally, the contour we choose
is along a ﬁxed µp [cf. Eq. (15)] since we know that L(2)

is positive. Therefore we have ∆I (1)

This implies Eq. (23).

(cid:4)

We stated lemma 2 with a constant c [80], not nec-
essarily c = 0, unlike lemma 1. This is because we do
not a priori know whether the contour I (1)
p = 0 exists,
and we derive a necessary and suﬃcient condition for its
existence in Sec V.

Analogous to Lemma 1, Lemma 2 implies that a “tem-
perature probe” [37] (deﬁned only by I (1)
p = 0) requires
the simultaneous speciﬁcation of a probe voltage µp so
that the temperature Tp = τ0(µp) (cf. footnote [80]) is
uniquely determined. Fig. 3 illustrates that the measured
temperature shows a large dependence on the probe volt-
age. Therefore, it becomes important to simultaneously
measure the voltage by imposing I (0)
p = 0. If the temper-
ature probe is not allowed to equilibrate electrically with
the system, then a temperature diﬀerence will build up
across the probe-system junction due to the Peltier eﬀect,
leading to an error in the temperature measurement.

Clearly, depending upon the probe voltage, the “tem-
perature probe” could measure any of a range of val-
ues, rendering the measurement somewhat meaningless
(see Fig. 3). Analogously, the “voltage probe” could
measure any of a range of values depending upon the
probe temperature (see Fig. 2). Thermoelectric probes
(also referred to as dual probes, and voltage-temperature
probes) treat temperature and voltage measurements on
an equal footing, and implicitly account for the thermo-
electric corrections exactly. Only such a dual probe is in
both thermal and electrical equilibrium with the system
being measured, and therefore yields an unbiased mea-
surement of both quantities. A mathematical proof of the

uniqueness of a voltage and temperature measurement is
therefore of fundamental importance.

consistent with the third law of thermodynamics. How-
ever, temperatures arbitarily close to absolute zero are,
in principle, possible [15].

Lemmas 1 and 2 are equivalent to the Clausius state-
ment of the second law [81]: “No process is possible whose
sole eﬀect is to transfer heat from a colder body to a
warmer body.” Lemma 2 gives us the direction in which
heat will ﬂow [cf. Eq. (24)] when the probe is biased away
from thermal equilibrium I (1)
p (µp, Tp) = 0: whenever the
probe is hotter than the temperature corresponding to lo-
cal thermal equilibrium, with the chemical potential held
constant, heat ﬂows out of the probe and vice versa. Sim-
ilarly, Lemma 1 gives us the direction in which particle
ﬂow occurs when the probe is biased away from electri-
cal equilibrium I (0)
p (µp, Tp) = 0: whenever the probe is
at a higher chemical potential than the one correspond-
ing to local electrical equilibrium, with temperature held
constant, particles ﬂow out of the probe and vice versa.
The problem of a unique measurement of a “voltage
probe” (deﬁned only by I (0)
p = 0), or a “temperature
probe” (deﬁned only by I (1)
p = 0) has been attempted
previously by Jacquet and Pillet [12] for transport be-
yond linear response, and to our knowledge is the only
work in this direction. However, in Ref. [12], the bias
conditions considered are quite restrictive and the result
assumes noninteracting electrons. Lemma 1 and lemma
2, respectively, generalize the result to arbitrary bias con-
ditions, and arbitary interactions within a quantum elec-
tron system while also providing a useful insight via the
Clausius statement of the second law of thermodynamics.
However, the question we would like to answer in this ar-
ticle pertains to the uniqueness of a thermoelectric probe
measurement, deﬁned by both I (0)
p = 0. A
result for such dual probes has been obtained only in the
linear response regime and for noninteracting electrons
[39].

and

h(ω) = (ω − µp)sTps(ω)(cid:18) −

We note that g(ω) and h(ω) belong to L2(R) [61]. Not-

The integral appearing on the lhs is L(1)

We drop the equality case above by noting that g and h
are linearly independent except for the trivial case when
Tps(ω) = 0 ∀ω, or when the probe coupling is narrowband
[Tps(ω) = ¯γδ(ω − ω0)] which we discuss in sec V C.
(cid:4)

The proof above can be easily extended to show the
positive-deﬁniteness of the linear response matrices [62]
widely used for elastic transport calculations (e.g.,
in
Refs. 63 and 82). Theorem 1 implies a positive thermal
conductance (see e.g., Ref. [82]), which is necessary for
positive entropy production consistent with the second
law of thermodynamics.

B. Uniqueness

nonequilibrium quantum system, measured by a thermo-
electric probe, is unique when it exists.

due to theorem 1. Therefore I (1)
p = 0 (or for that matter
I (1)
p = c, for any c) is satisﬁed at most at a single point
along I (0)
(cid:4)

p = 0.

Theorem 1 is a form of the second law of thermody-
namics that gives us the direction in which the heat cur-
rent ﬂows along the contour I (0)
p = 0 (cf. Eq. (34)). The
heat current I (1)
p decreases monotonically along the con-
tour I (0)
p = 0. Therefore we may ﬁnd only one point
along I (0)
p = 0 that also satisﬁes I (1)
p = 0 , which implies
a unique solution to Eq. (11) when it exists.

Indeed, Onsager points out in his 1931 paper [62] that
for positive entropy production, the linear response ma-
trix will have to be positive-deﬁnite (which translates to
our condition in Theorem 1). However, that analysis
rests upon the assumption of linear response near equi-
librium. Our result in Theorem 1 does not require such
a condition for the nonequilibrium state of the system,
but instead emerges out of the analysis of the currents
ﬂowing into a weakly-coupled probe. In addition, we ob-
tain a strict mathematical proof of theorem 1. We point
out that theorem 1 holds even when the physically ex-
pected postulate 1 fails, making the uniqueness result in
theorem 2 very general [61].

V. EXISTENCE

A unique local measurement of temperature and volt-
age is only part of our main problem. An equally im-
portant part is to derive the conditions for the existence
of a solution. The main idea behind this analysis is to
follow the number current contour I (0)
p = 0 and ask what
happens to the heat current I (1)

second law of thermodynamics: The heat current is monotonically decreasing along P Q (thus implying uniqueness).

The resonances in the spectrum ¯A(ω) correspond to the eigenstates of the closed two-level Hamiltonian (see Sec.
V D) ǫ± = ±1 shown in magenta. The Fermi-Dirac distribution is monotonically decreasing with energy, and
corresponds to a situation with positive temperature (no net population inversion). The necessary and suﬃcient
condition for the existence of a positive temperature solution is stated in Theorem 3.

p = 0 (shown in

higher and higher temperatures, Tp → ∞. We noted that
near Tp = 0, the heat current into the probe must be posi-
tive, consistent with the third law of thermodynamics [cf.
Eq. (25)]. Since we know that the heat current is mono-
tonically decreasing along the number current contour
(Theorem 2), we could guess whether or not a solution
occurs depending upon the asymptotic value of the heat
current along that contour as Tp → ∞. In this way, we
ﬁnd a necessary and suﬃcient condition for the existence
of a solution while analyzing the problem for positive
temperatures (see Fig. 4 for an illustration of this case).
On the other hand, when this condition is not met, one
can immediately prove that a negative temperature must
satisfy the measurement condition I (ν)
p = 0, ν = {0, 1}.
This latter condition corresponds to a system exhibiting
local population inversion which leads to negative tem-
perature [83] solutions, as illustrated in Fig. 5.

Our results here are again completely general and are
valid for electron systems with arbitrary interactions, ar-
bitrary steady state bias conditions, and for any weakly-
coupled probe. However, our analysis here leads us to de-
marcate between two extremes of the probe-system cou-
pling. We conclude that an ideal probe is one which op-
erates in the broadband limit. A measurement by such a
probe depends only on the properties of the system that
it couples to, and is independent of the spectral proper-
ties of the probe itself. The broadband limit lends itself
to an easier physical interpretation of the population in-
version condition as well, and we discuss this important
limit in Sec. V B. The other extreme is that of a narrow-

band probe which is capable of probing the system at just
one value of energy, leading to a nonunique measurement
(see also the proof of theorem 1), and is discussed in Sec.
V C. Only this pathological case leads to an exception to
Theorem 2.

The simplest system which could, in principle, exhibit
population inversion is a two-level system. Therefore,
our results, including that of the previous section, have
been illustrated by using a two-level system. The details
of the nonequilibrium two-level system and its coupling
to the thermoelectric probe are given in Sec. V D.

Our analysis starts with a rearragement of the currents
given by Eq. (1) and a restatement of the measurement
condition [cf. Eq. (11)] in terms of energy currents, and
we also deﬁne some useful quantities along the way. We
may rewrite the number current in Eq. (1) as

p = h ˙N i|fs − h ˙N i|fp
I (0)

(35)

where

h ˙N i|fs ≡

h ˙N i|fp ≡

hZ ∞

dωTps(ω)fs(ω),

(36)

dωTps(ω)fp(ω).

(37)

The quantitity h ˙N i|fs is the rate of particle ﬂow into the
probe from the system, while h ˙N i|fp gives the rate of
particle ﬂow out of the probe and into the system.

Similarly, the rate of energy ﬂow into the probe from

the system is

dω ωTps(ω)fs(ω),

(38)

dω ωTps(ω)fp(ω)

(39)

gives the rate of energy outﬂux from the probe back into
the system. The net energy current ﬂowing into the probe
is given by I E

p = h ˙Ei|fs − h ˙Ei|fp .

The local equilibration conditions in Eq. (11) now be-

come

h ˙N i|fp = h ˙N i|fs
h ˙Ei|fp = h ˙Ei|fs.

(40)

The equation for the rate of energy ﬂow above is equiv-
alent to the condition I (1)

p = 0 when I (0)

p = 0 since

p (µp, Tp) ≡ h ˙Ei|fs − h ˙Ei|fp = I (1)

(41)

The lhs in Eq. (40) depends upon the probe parameters
(temperature and voltage) while the rhs is ﬁxed for a
given nonequilibrium system with a given local distribu-
tion function fs(ω). The probe measures the appropriate
voltage and temperature when it exchanges no net charge
and energy with the system.

We may introduce a characteristic rate of particle ﬂow

[cf. Eq. (7)] as

and we retain the strict inequalities imposed by Eq. (43)
(see also Eqs. (9) and (10) and the preceding discussion).
We similarly introduce a characteristic rate for the en-

ergy ﬂow between the system and probe:

ﬁnd that ωc → ∞ necessarily implies a positive temper-
ature solution. We remind the reader that ωc → −∞
is physically impossible due to the principle that any
physical system must have a lower bound for the energy
(hHi ≥ −c for some ﬁnite c ∈ R).

The quantities h ˙N i|fs , h ˙N i|fp , h ˙N i|f ≡1, h ˙Ei|fs , h ˙Ei|fp ,
h ˙Ei|f ≡1 are all ﬁnite due to postulate 1 [cf. Eqs. (7-10)].

A. Asymptotic Properties, and Conditions for the

Existence of a Solution

p

Traversing along I (0)

p = 0 results in a monotonically
decreasing heat current I (1)
(Theorem 2). Here, we tra-
verse the contour from low temperatures (Tp → 0) to
higher temperatures (Tp → ∞) as discussed in Theorem
2. This implies a monotonically increasing h ˙Ei|fp due to
Eq. (41). We proceed to calculate the asymtotic value of
h ˙Ei|fp along the number current contour.

Let the asymptotic scaling of µp = M (Tp) deﬁned by

the contour I (0)

p (µp, Tp) = 0 (lemma 1) be

The above limiting value satisﬁes the inequality in Eq.

h ˙N i|fp = h ˙N i|fs by construction, therefore Λ is computed
from the equation

γp


= h ˙N i|fs .

(47)

It is important to note that the asymptotic scaling de-
ﬁned by Eq. (45) does not mean that the scaling is lin-
ear. For example, a sublinear scaling M (Tp) = αT n
p with
n < 1 merely corresponds to Λ = 0 which could satisfy
Eq. (47) if the nonequilibrium system is prepared in that
way. However, Λ → ±∞ do not obey the strict inequality
in Eq. (43). Λ → ∞ corresponds to a trivial and unphys-
ical nonequilibrium distribution fs(ω) ≡ 1, and likewise,
Λ → −∞ corresponds to fs(ω) ≡ 0 ∀ω.

Ideal Probes: The Broadband Limit

Theorem 3 A positive temperature solution exists if
and only if there is no net population inversion, i.e., when

h ˙Ei|fs
h ˙N i|fs

< ωc.

(49)

Proof. h ˙Ei|fp /h ˙N i|fs < h ˙Ei|fs /h ˙N i|fs when Tp → 0
along the contour I (0)
p = 0 [cf. Eq. (25) and Eq. (41)].
The asymptotic limit of h ˙Ei|fp /h ˙N i|fs is ωc [cf. Eq. (48)].
h ˙Ei|fp is continuous ∀ µp ∈ (−∞, ∞), Tp ∈ (0, ∞) and
is monotonically increasing along I (0)
p = 0 (Theorem 2).
We use the intermediate value theorem.
(cid:4)

Corollary 3.1 There exists a negative temperature so-
lution for a nonequilibrium system with net population
inversion, i.e., when

In the broadband limit, the probe-system coupling be-
comes energy independent, and we may write Γp(ω) =
Γp(µ0). The spectrum of the system, sampled locally by
the probe, is given by

¯A(ω) ≡

Tr {Γp(ω)A(ω)}

Tr {Γp(ω)}

=

Tr {Γp(µ0)A(ω)}

Tr {Γp(µ0)}

[13]

hN i|fp = hN i|fs
hEi|fp = hEi|fs .

(55)

The above equations imply that an ideal measurement of
voltage and temperature constitutes a measurement of
the zeroth and ﬁrst moments of the local energy distri-
bution of the system. That is to say, when the probe
is in local equilibrium with the nonequilibrium system,
the local occupancy and energy of the system are the
same as they would be if the system’s local spectrum
were populated by the equilibrium Fermi-Dirac distribu-
tion fp ≡ fp(µp, Tp) of the probe.

We may now write the condition for the existence of a

the eigenstates of the closed two-level Hamiltonian (see Sec. V D) ǫ± = ±1 shown in magenta. The system has a net
population inversion, satisfying the conditions of Corollary 3.1, and the probe Fermi-Dirac distribution is
monotonically increasing with energy, corresponding to a negative temperature.

p = 0 (shown in

The condition in Eq. (56) implies the following: Given
some nonequilibrium distribution function fs, one can
have a positive temperature solution if and only if the
average energy per particle is smaller than the centroid
of the spectrum. In other words, a positive temperature
solution exists if and only if there is no net population
inversion. Similarly, the corollary 3.1 states that there
exists a negative temperature solution for a system ex-
hibiting population inversion:

hEi|fs
hN i|fs

> ωc.

(58)

The advantage of the broadband limit is that one may
write the measurement conditions, as well as the condi-
tion for the existence of a solution, in terms of the local
expectation values of the energy and occupancy directly,
instead of using the rate of particle and energy ﬂow into
the probe. We also do not need to introduce a “char-
acteristic tunneling rate.” We note that ωc in Eq. (57)
is the centroid since the local spectrum ¯A normalizes to
unity within the broadband limit (see Appendix A 1).

A local measurement by a weakly-coupled broadband
thermoelectric probe is ideal in the sense that the re-
sult is independent of the properties of the probe, and
depends only on the nonequilibrium state of the system
and the subsystem thereof sampled by the probe. Such a
measurement provides more than just an operational def-
inition of the local temperature and voltage of a nonequi-
librium quantum system, since the thermodynamic vari-
ables are determined directly by the moments (54) of the

local (nonequilibrium) energy distribution.

C. Nonunique Measurements: The Narrowband

Limit

A narrowband probe is one that samples the system
only within a very narrow window of energy. The extreme
case of such a probe-system coupling would be a Dirac-
delta function:

Γp(ω) = 2πV †

p Vpδ(ω − ω0),

(59)

which gives Tps(ω) = 2π Tr(cid:8)VpA(ω)V †

we write simply as

p(cid:9) δ(ω − ω0) which

Tps(ω) = γ(ω) δ(ω − ω0),

(60)

where γ(ω) = 2π Tr(cid:8)VpA(ω)V †

ergy.

p(cid:9) has dimensions of en-

We previously noted that Theorem 1 does not hold for
Tps given by Eq. (60). One can verify straightforwardly
that, for a probe-sample transmission that is extremely
narrow, we will have

L(0)

ps L(2)

ps(cid:1)2
ps −(cid:0)L(1)

= 0.

(61)

This results in a nonunique solution since following the
proof of theorem 2 would give us [cf. Eq. (34)] ∆I (1)
p = 0.
In fact, it would lead to a family of solutions.

We may solve for the solution explicitly. The number

12

current reduces to

I (0)
p =

γ(ω0)

h (cid:0)fp(ω0) − fs(ω0)(cid:1),

while the heat current is given by

I (1)
p = (ω0 − µp)

γ(ω0)

h (cid:0)fp(ω0) − fs(ω0)(cid:1),

which trivially vanishes for vanishing number current.
Therefore, the family of solutions to the measurement
is simply given by

(62)

(63)

fp(ω0; µp, Tp) = fs(ω0),

(64)

which is linear in the µp − Tp plane and is given by

µp = ω0 − Tp log(cid:18) 1 − fs(ω0)
fs(ω0) (cid:19).

(65)

fs(ω) has the following explicit form:

fs(ω) =

A narrowband probe is therefore unsuitable for thermo-
electric measurements. Even if a probe were to sample
the system at just two distinct energies ω1 and ω2, the-
orem 1 would hold and the thermoelectric measurement
would be unique.
Indeed, the narrowband probe is a
pathological case whose only function is to highlight a
certain theoretical limitation for the measurement of the
temperature and voltage.

D. Example: Two-level system

Net population inversion is essentially a quantum phe-
nomenon, since classical Hamiltonians are generally un-
bounded above due to the kinetic energy term, i.e., there
does not exist a ﬁnite c ∈ R that satisﬁes hHi < c. In
other words, ωc → ∞ generally holds for classical sys-
tems and negative temperatures are not possible. The
simplest quantum system where a net population inver-
sion can be achieved is a two-level system. We therefore
illustrated our results for a two-level system in ﬁgs. 2
to 5.

The system Hamiltonian here was taken to be

H =(cid:20) ǫ1 V
V ∗ ǫ2(cid:21) ,

(67)

whose values were set as V = 2(1−i)
, ǫ1 = 1/3 and
ǫ2 = −1/3, such that the eigenvalues are ǫ± = ±1
and units are taken as eV . We introduce two reserv-
iors that are strongly coupled locally to each site with
Γ1 = diag(0.5, 0) and Γ2 = diag(0, 0.5), while the probe
coupling is taken as Γp = diag(0.01, 0.1), which is about

ﬁve times weaker than the coupling to the reservoirs that
bias the system.

We used two diﬀerent bias conditions: (a) To illustrate
the case without a net population inversion in ﬁgs. 2 to 4,
the reservoirs had a symmetric (µ1 + µ2 = 0) voltage bias
µ1 − µ2 = 1eV ; (b) to illustrate the case with a net pop-
ulation inversion in ﬁg. 5, the reservoirs had a symmetric
voltage bias of µ1 − µ2 = 4eV . The two reservoirs are
held at T = 300K for both cases.

It has been previously noted that the probe-system
coupling strength does not strongly aﬀect the measured
temperature and voltage even when varied over several
orders of magnitude [52], but we remind the reader that
our theoretical results depend upon the assumption of a
weakly-coupled probe (noninvasive measurements). How
weak is weak enough is a diﬀerent, and perhaps more
subtle, theoretical question. Numerically, however, we do
ﬁnd that the probe measurements are not much altered
even when the probe coupling strength is comparable to
that of the strongly-coupled reservoirs.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

The local temperature and voltage of a nonequilibrium
quantum system are deﬁned in terms of the equilibration

of a noninvasive thermoelectric probe, locally coupled to
the system. The simultaneous temperature and voltage
measurement is shown to be unique for any system of
fermions in steady state, arbitrarily far from equilibrium,
with arbitrary interactions within the system, and the
conditions for the existence of a solution are derived. In
particular, it is shown that a positive temperature solu-
tion exists provided the system does not have a net local
population inversion; in the case of population inversion,
a unique negative temperature solution is shown to exist.
These results provide a ﬁrm mathematical foundation for
temperature and voltage measurements in quantum sys-
tems far from equilibrium.

Our analysis reveals that a simultaneous temperature
and voltage measurement is uniquely determined by the
local spectrum and nonequilibrium distribution of the
system [cf. Eq. (40)], and is independent of the prop-
erties of the probe for broadband coupling (ideal probe).
Such a measurement therefore provides a fundamental
deﬁnition of local temperature and voltage, which is not
merely operational.

In contrast, prior theoretical work relied almost exclu-
sively on operational deﬁnitions [12, 37–46], leading to
a competing panoply of often contradictory predictions
for the measurement of such basic observables as tem-
perature and voltage. Measurements of temperature or
voltage, taken separately (see, e.g., Refs. 12 and 37), are
shown to be ill-posed: a thermometer out of electrical
equilibrium with a system produces an error due to the
Peltier eﬀect across the probe-sample junction, while a
potentiometer out of thermal equilibrium with a system
produces an error due to the Seebeck eﬀect.

Our results put the local thermodynamic variables
temperature and voltage on a mathematically rigorous
footing for fermion systems under very general nonequi-
librium steady-state conditions, a necessary ﬁrst step to-
ward the construction of nonequilibrium thermodynam-
ics [8–15]. Our analysis includes the eﬀect of interactions
with bosonic degrees of freedom (e.g., photons, phonons,
etc.) on the fermions. However, the temperatures of
the bosons themselves [53, 54] were not addressed in the
present analysis. Moreover, we did not explicitly con-
sider magnetic systems, which require separate consider-
ation of the spin degree of freedom, and its polarization.
Future investigation of probes that exchange bosonic or
spin excitations may enable similarly rigorous analysis of
local thermodynamic variables in bosonic and magnetic
systems, respectively.

Appendix A: The nonequilibrium steady state

The nonequilibrium steady state is described by a den-
sity matrix ˆρ that is time-independent. The expectation
values of observables are given by their usual prescription
in statistical physics, e.g.,

h ˆQi = Trnˆρ ˆQo =Xµ,ν

ρµνhν| ˆQ|µi.

(A1)

The “lesser” and “greater” Green’s functions [58] used

in the paper are deﬁned as follows

G<

αβ(t) ≡ ihd†

β(0)dα(t)i,

while its Hermitian conjugate is

αβ(t) ≡ −ihdα(t)d†

evolves according to the Heisenberg equation of motion
for a system with Hamiltonian ˆH. Here, α, β denote
basis states in the 1-body Hilbert space of the system.

The spectral representation uses the eigenbasis of the
Hamiltonian ˆH|νi = Eν |νi, where ν denotes a many-
body energy eigenstate. One may write the “lesser”
Green’s function as

G<

αβ(ω) = 2πi Xµ,µ′,ν

(cid:19),

while the “greater” Green’s function becomes

(A9)
In our theory of local thermodynamic measurements,
the quantity of interest is the local spectrum of the sys-
tem sampled by the probe ¯A(ω), deﬁned in Eq. (53).
This obeys a further sum rule in the broadband limit
(ideal probe), discussed below.

a. Local spectrum in the broadband limit

The probe-system coupling is energy independent in
the broadband limit, Γp(ω) = const, and we write
Tr {Γp} = ¯Γp for its trace. The local spectrum sampled
by the probe ¯A(ω) deﬁned in Eq. (53) can be written in
the broadband limit as

¯A(ω) =

1

¯Γp Xα,β

hβ|Γp|αiAαβ (ω).

(A10)

In this limit, it obeys a further sum rule:

h ˆQ(t)i =Xµ,ν
=Xµ,ν
=Xµ,ν

ρµν hν| ˆQ(t)|µi

The system observables must be independent of time in
steady state. Therefore ˆρ must be diagonal in the energy
basis, as seen from the above equation. The nondiagonal
parts of ˆρ in the energy basis, when they exist, must be
in a degenerate subspace so that Eµ = Eν in the above
equation.

For states degenerate in energy, the boundary condi-
tions determining the nonequilibrium steady state will
determine the basis in which ˆρ is diagonal. Henceforth,
we work in that basis.

3. Positivity of −iG<(ω) and iG>(ω)

Working in the energy eigenbasis in which ˆρ is diagonal,

−ihα|G<(ω)|αi ≡ −iG<

αα(ω) =

2πXµ,µ′

Similarly,

It follows that

Therefore, all three operators −iG<(ω), iG>(ω), and
A(ω) are positive-semideﬁnite.

0 ≤ fs(ω) ≤ 1

The broadband limit is special in that the measurement
is determined by the local properties of the system itself,
and is not inﬂuenced by the spectrum of the probe. In
this limit, the local spectrum ¯A(ω) obeys the sum rule
(A11) since the probe samples the same subsystem at
all energies. One should not expect such a local sum
rule to hold outside the broadband limit, since the probe
samples diﬀerent subsystems at diﬀerent energies.

The nonequilibrium distribution function fs(ω) was

deﬁned in Eq. (3) as

fs(ω) ≡

Tr {Γp(ω)G<(ω)}
2πi Tr {Γp(ω)A(ω)}

.

(A16)

We have Γp(ω) > 0 by causality [58]:

Im Σr

p(ω) = −

1
2

Γp(ω) < 0.

(A17)

Let Γp|γpi = γp|γpi, where γp ≥ 0 and some γp satisfy
γp > 0. The energy dependence is taken to be implicit.
The traces in Eq. (A16) may be evaluated in the eigen-
basis of Γp, yielding:

Therefore

γphγp|G<(ω)|γpi
γphγp|A(ω)|γpi

γphγp| − iG<(ω)|γpi

γphγp| − iG<(ω) + iG>(ω)|γpi

(A18)
