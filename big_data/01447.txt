An approach to QCD vacuum as a medium describable in terms of statistical ensemble of almost
everywhere homogeneous Abelian (anti-)self-dual gluon ﬁelds is brieﬂy reviewed. These ﬁelds play
the role of the conﬁning medium for color charged ﬁelds as well as underline the mechanism of
realization of chiral SUL(Nf )× SUR(Nf ) and UA(1) symmetries. Hadronization formalism based on
this ensemble leads to manifestly deﬁned quantum eﬀective meson action. Strong, electromagnetic
and weak interactions of mesons are represented in the action in terms of nonlocal n-point interaction
vertices given by the quark-gluon loops averaged over the background ensemble. New systematic
results for the mass spectrum and decay constants of radially excited light, heavy-light mesons and
heavy quarkonia are presented. Interrelation between the present approach, models based on ideas
of soft wall AdS/QCD, light front holographic QCD, and the picture of harmonic conﬁnement is
outlined.

INTRODUCTION

2

Almost forty ﬁve years ago Feynman, Kislinger, and Ravndal noticed [1] that the Regge spectrum of meson and
baryon masses could be universally described by assuming the four-dimensional harmonic oscillator potential acting
between quarks and antiquarks. During subsequent years the idea of four-dimensional harmonic oscillator re-entered
the discussion about quark conﬁnement several times in various ways. Leutwyler and Stern developed the formalism
devoted to the covariant description of bilocal meson-like ﬁelds Φ(x, z) combined with the idea of harmonic conﬁne-
ment [2–6]. Considerations of paper [1] and Leutwyler-Stern formalism [2–6] can be seen as the forerunners to at
present time very popular soft wall AdS/QCD models [7] and the light front holographic QCD [8–10]. In recent years,
the approaches to conﬁnement based on the ideas of soft wall AdS/QCD model and light front holography demon-
strated an impressive phenomenological success [7–12]. The crucial for phenomenology features of these approaches
are the particular dilaton proﬁle ϕ(z) = κ2z2 and the harmonic oscillator form of the conﬁning potential as the func-
tion of ﬁfth coordinate z. All these approaches begin with diﬀerent motivation but ﬁnally come to the Schr¨odinger
type diﬀerential equation with the harmonic potential in z deﬁning the wave functions and mass spectrum of mesons
and baryons.

The physical origin of the above-mentioned particular form of dilaton proﬁle in AdS/QCD and light front holography
as well as the harmonic potential in the Stern-Leutwyler studies and, hence, the Laguerre polynomial form of the
meson wave functions, could not be identiﬁed within these approaches themselves. The preferable form of the dilaton
proﬁle and/or the potential are determined by the phenomenological requirement of Regge character of the excited
meson mass spectrum [1–7].

The approach presented in this paper has been developed in essence twenty years ago [13]. It clearly incorporates
the idea of harmonic conﬁnement both in terms of elementary color charged ﬁelds and the composite colorless hadron
ﬁeld. The distinctive feature of the present approach is that it basically links the concept of harmonic conﬁnement
and Regge character of hadron mass spectrum to the speciﬁc class of nonperturbative gluon conﬁgurations – almost
everywhere homogeneous Abelian (anti-)self-dual gluon ﬁelds. A posteriori a close interrelation of the Abelian (anti-
)self-dual ﬁelds and the hadronization based on harmonic conﬁnement can be read oﬀ the papers [2–6, 14–16]. In
brief, the line of arguments is as follows (for more detailed exposition see [17]).

An important benchmark has been the observation of Pagels and Tomboulis [18] that Abelian self-dual ﬁelds describe
a medium inﬁnitely stiﬀ to small gauge ﬁeld ﬂuctuations, i.e. the wave solutions for the eﬀective quantum equations of
motion are absent. This feature was interpreted as suggestive of conﬁnement of color. Strong argumentation in favour
of the Abelian (anti-)self-dual homogeneous ﬁeld as a candidate for the global nontrivial minimum of the eﬀective
action originates from the papers [14, 16, 19–21]. In particular, Leutwyler has shown that the constant gauge ﬁeld
is stable (tachyon free) against small quantum ﬂuctuations only if it is Abelian (anti-)self-dual covariantly constant
ﬁeld [14, 16]. Nonperturbative calculation of the eﬀective potential within the functional renormalization group [19]
supported the earlier one-loop results on existence of the nontrivial minimum of the eﬀective action for the Abelian
(anti-)self-dual ﬁeld.

The eigenvalues of the Dirac and Klein-Gordon operators in the presence of Abelian self-dual ﬁeld are purely discrete,
and the corresponding eigenfunctions of quarks and gluons are of the bound state type. This is a consequence of the
fact that these operators contain the four-dimensional harmonic oscillator, acting as a conﬁning harmonic potential.
Eigenmodes of the color charged ﬁelds have no (quasi-)particle interpretation but describe ﬁeld ﬂuctuations decaying
in space and time. The consequence of this property is that the momentum representation of the translation invariant
part of the propagator of the color charged ﬁeld in the background of (anti-)self-dual Abelian gauge ﬁeld is entire
analytical function. The absence of pole in the propagator was treated as the absence of the particle interpretation
of the charged ﬁeld [15]. However just the absence of a single quark or anti-quark in the spectrum can not be
considered as suﬃcient condition for conﬁnement. One has to explain the most peculiar feature of QCD – the Regge
character of the physical spectrum of colorless hadrons. Usually Regge spectrum is related to the string picture of
conﬁnement, justiﬁed in two complementary ways and limits: classical relativistic rotating string connecting massless
quark and antiquark, and the linear potential between nonrelativistic heavy quark and antiquark with the area law
for the temporal Wilson loop as a relevant criterion for static quark conﬁnement. Neither the homogeneous Abelian
(anti-)self-dual ﬁeld itself nor the form of gluon propagator in the presence of this background had the clue to linear
quark-antiquark potential. Nevertheless, the analytic structure of the gluon and quark propagators and assumption
about the randomness of the background ﬁeld ensemble led both to the area law for static quarks and the Regge
spectrum for light hadrons.

Randomness of the ensemble of almost everywhere homogeneous Abelian (anti-)self-dual gluon ﬁelds has been taken
into account implicitly in the model of hadronization developed in [13, 22] via averaging of the quark loops over the
parameters of the random ﬁelds. The nonlocal quark-meson vertices with the complete set of meson quantum numbers
were determined in this model by the form of the color charged gluon propagator. The spectrum of mesons displayed
the Regge character both with respect to total angular momentum and radial quantum number of the meson. The

3

reason for conﬁnement of a single quark and Regge spectrum of mesons turned out to be the same – the analytic
properties of quark and gluon propagators.

This result has almost completed the quark conﬁnement picture based on the random almost everywhere homo-
geneous Abelian (anti-)self-dual ﬁelds. Self-duality of the ﬁelds plays the crucial role in this picture. This random
ﬁeld ensemble represents a medium where the color charged elementary excitations exist as quickly decaying in space
and time ﬁeld ﬂuctuations but the collective colorless excitations (mesons) can propagate as plain waves (particles).
It should be stressed that in this formalism any meson looks much more like a complicated collective excitation of
a medium (QCD vacuum) involving quark, antiquark and gluon ﬁelds than a nonrelativistic quantum mechanical
bound state of charged particles (quark and anti-quark) due to some potential interaction between them. Within this
relativistic quantum ﬁeld description the Regge spectrum of color neutral collective modes appeared as a ”medium
eﬀect” as well as the suppression (conﬁnement) of a color charged elementary modes.

However, besides this dynamical color charge conﬁnement, a correct complete picture must include the limit of
static quark-antiquark pair with the area law for the temporal Wilson loop. In order to explore this aspect an explicit
construction of the random domain ensemble was suggested in paper [23], and the area law for the Wilson loop was
demonstrated by the explicit calculation. Randomness of the ensemble (in line with [24]) and (anti-)self-duality of
the ﬁelds are crucial for this result.

In this paper we brieﬂy review the approach to conﬁnement, chiral symmetry realization and bosonization based on
the representation of QCD vacuum in terms of the statistical ensemble of almost everywhere homogeneous Abelian
(anti-)self-dual gluon ﬁelds, systematically calculate the spectrum of radial meson excitations and their decay constants
and outline the possible relation between the formalism of soft wall AdS/QCD and light-front holography, and this,
at ﬁrst sight, diﬀerent approach.

The character of meson wave functions in hadronization approach [13] is ﬁxed by the form of the gluon propagator
in the background of the speciﬁc class of vacuum gluon conﬁgurations. These wave functions are almost identical
to the wave functions of the soft wall AdS/QCD with quadratic dilaton proﬁle and Leutwyler-Stern formalism. In
all three cases we are dealing with the generalized Laguerre polynomials as the functions of z. In the hadronization
approach of [13] and [22] the ﬁfth coordinate z appears as the relative distance between quark and antiquark in
the center of quark mass coordinate system, while the center of mass coordinate x represents the space-time point
where the meson ﬁeld is localized. This treatment of coordinates goes in line with the Leutwyler-Stern approach.
Comparison of the soft wall AdS/QCD action and the eﬀective action for auxiliary bilocal meson-like ﬁelds of the
hadronization approach hints at the link between very appearance of dilaton and its particular proﬁle and the form
of nonperturbative gluon propagator. The strictly quadratic in z dilaton proﬁle corresponds to the propagator in
the presence of strictly homogeneous (anti-)self-dual Abelian gluon ﬁeld that is an idealization of the domain wall
network background with inﬁnitely thin domain walls. These three approaches can be considered as complementary
to each other ways to describe conﬁnement in terms of meson wave functions. However, unlike two other approaches
bosonization in the background of domain wall networks relates the form of meson wave functions to the particular
vacuum structure of QCD and provides one with the manifestly deﬁned meson eﬀective action that describes strong,
electromagnetic and weak interactions of mesons in terms of nonlocal vertices given by the quark-gluon loops. New
results for mass spectrum and decay constants of radially excited light, heavy-light mesons and heavy quarkonia
are presented. An overall accuracy of description is 10-15 percent in the lowest order calculation achieved with the
minimal for QCD set of parameters: infrared limits of renormalized strong coupling constant g and quark masses mf ,
scalar gluon condensate (cid:104)g2F 2(cid:105) as a fundamental scale of QCD and topological susceptibility of pure QCD without
quarks. This last parameter can be related to the mean size of domains. It should be noted that the present paper
also completes and clariﬁes the studies of [13, 22, 25] in two important respects: diagonalization of the quadratic
part of the meson eﬀective action with respect to radial quantum number, clariﬁcation of the physical meaning of
the quark mass parameters in the context of the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking by the background ﬁeld and
four-fermion interaction.

The paper is organized as follows. Section II is devoted to motivation of the approach. Derivation of the eﬀective
meson action is considered in section III. Results for the masses, transition and decay constants of various mesons
are presented in section IV. In the section V we outline possible relation between the present hadronization approach
and the formalism of the soft wall AdS/QCD model, light front holographic QCD, compare the quark and gluon
propagators of the present approach with the results of functional renormalization group (FRG) and Dyson-Schwinger
equations (DSE). Important technical details are given in the appendices.

II. DOMAIN WALL NETWORKS AS QCD VACUUM

The primary phenomenological basis of the present approach is the existence of nonzero condensates in QCD, ﬁrst

of all – the scalar gluon condensate (cid:104)g2F 2(cid:105).

µ to be integrated over (see, e.g., Ref.[26]). Besides the formal mathematical content, these conditions play the
role of substantial physical input which, together with the classical action of QCD, complements the statement of the
quantization problem. In other words, starting with the very basic representation of the Euclidean functional integral

Thus deﬁned quantum eﬀective action Seﬀ[B] has a physical meaning of the free energy of the quantum ﬁeld system

in the presence of the background gluon ﬁeld Ba
of gauge ﬁeld conﬁgurations representing the equilibrium state (vacuum) of the system.

Quite reliable argumentation in favour of (almost everywhere) homogeneous Abelian (anti-)self-dual ﬁelds as dom-
inating vacuum conﬁgurations was put forward by many authors [14, 18]. As it has already been mentioned in
Introduction, nonperturbative calculation of QCD quantum eﬀective action within the functional renormalization
group approach [19] supported the one-loop result [14, 16, 18] and indicated the existence of a minimum of the
eﬀective potential for nonzero value of Abelian (anti-)self-dual homogeneous gluon ﬁeld.

Ginzburg-Landau (GL) approach to the quantum eﬀective action indicated a possibility of the domain wall network
formation in QCD vacuum resulting in the dominating vacuum gluon conﬁguration seen as an ensemble of densely
packed lumps of covariantly constant Abelian (anti-)self-dual ﬁeld [17, 20, 21, 23]. Nonzero scalar gluon condensate

FIG. 1. Eﬀective potential (2) as a function of the angle ω between chromomagnetic and chromoelectric ﬁeld and the mixing
angle ξ in the Cartan subalgebra. The minima in the dark gray regions correspond to the Abelian (anti-)self-dual conﬁgurations
and form a periodic structure labelled by integer indices (kl) in Eq. (3) (for more details see [17, 20, 23]).

where l = 0 and l = 1 correspond to the self-dual and anti-self-dual ﬁeld respectively, matrix ˘nk belongs to Cartan
subalgebra of su(3) with six values of the angle ξk corresponding to the boundaries of the Weyl chambers in the root
space of su(3).

The minima are connected by the parity and Weyl group reﬂections. Their existence indicates that the system is
prone to the domain wall formation. To demonstrate the simplest example of domain wall interpolating between the
self-dual and anti-self-dual Abelian conﬁgurations, one allows the angle ω between chromomagnetic and chromoelectric
ﬁelds to vary from point to point in R4 and restricts other degrees of freedom of gluon ﬁeld to their vacuum values.
In this case Ginsburg-Landau Lagrangian leads to the sine-Gordon equation for ω with the standard kink solution
(for details see Ref. [17, 20])

ω(xν) = 2 arctan (exp(µxν)) .

Away from the kink location vacuum ﬁeld is almost self-dual (ω = 0) or anti-self-dual (ω = π). Exactly at the wall it
becomes purely chromomagnetic (ω = π/2). Domain wall network is constructed by means of the kink superposition.
In general kink can be parametrized as

where µi is inverse width of the kink, ηi

µ can be constructively repre-
sented as the inﬁnite dimensional (in the inﬁnite volume) integral over the parameters of N → ∞ domain walls in
the network: their positions, orientations and widths, with the weight determined by the eﬀective action. It should
be noted that chronologically the explicit construction of the domain wall network is the most recent development of
the formalism that have been studied in the series of papers [13, 22, 23, 25, 27], in which the domain wall defects in

the homogeneous Abelian (anti-)self-dual ﬁeld were taken into account either implicitly or in an explicit but simpli-
ﬁed form with the spherical domains. The practical calculations in the next sections will be done within combined
implementation of domain model given in paper [25]: propagators in the quark loops are taken in the approximation
of the homogeneous background ﬁeld and the quark loops are averaged over the background ﬁeld, the correlators of
the background ﬁeld are calculated in the spherical domain approximation.

is an example of conﬁning almost everywhere homogeneous Abelian (anti-)self-dual ﬁelds. Red (blue) color corresponds to the
self-dual ﬁeld (anti-self-dual), green – pure chromomagnetic ﬁeld. The rightmost plot represents the case of preferably pure
chromomagnetic ﬁeld when the topological charge density is nearly zero and color charged quasiparticles can be excited thus
indicating deconﬁnement (for more details see [17]).

III. HADRONIZATION WITHIN THE DOMAIN MODEL OF QCD VACUUM

The haronization formalism based on domain model of QCD vacuum was elaborated in the series of papers
[13, 22, 23, 25]. We refer to these papers for most of the technical details omitted in this brief presentation. It has
been shown that the model embraces static (area law) and dynamical quark conﬁnement (propagators in momentum
representation are entire analytical functions) as well as spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry by the background
domain structured ﬁeld itself. UA(1) problem was resolved without introducing the strong CP-violation [27]. Esti-
mation of masses of light, heavy-light mesons and heavy quarkonia along with their orbital excitations [13, 22, 25]
demonstrated promising phenomenological performance. However, calculations in Refs. [22, 25] have been done ne-
glecting a mixing between radially excited meson ﬁelds. Below we present results of calculation reﬁned in this respect.
In the spherical domain approximation, the background gluon ﬁelds are represented by the ensemble of domain-

structured ﬁelds with the strength tensor [23, 25]

ˆn(k) = t3 cos ξk + t8 sin ξk,

(2k + 1), k = 0, . . . , 5

,

where zk is the space-time coordinate of the k-th domain center, scale Λ and mean domain radius R are parame-
ters of the model related to the scalar gluon condensate and topological susceptibility of pure Yang-Mills vacuum,
respectively [23].

The measure of integration over ensemble of background ﬁelds is deﬁned as [23, 25]

where by construction the gauge coupling constant g and the exact renormalized n-point gluon Green functions of pure
gauge theory in the presence of the background ﬁeld B appear to be renormalized within appropriate renormalization
scheme. It is needless to say that the functional form of these Green functions, gluon propagator in particular, has
been a subject of many investigations carried out over decades. Quite reliable information about two- and three-
point Euclidean Green functions was obtained within the functional renormalization group, Lattice QCD as well as
calculations based on Dyson-Schwinger equations.
At this step one has to set up the approximation scheme. We truncate the exponent in W [j|B] up to the four-fermion
interaction term. Interaction between standard local color charged quark currents is described by the product of the
(x1, x2|B) which will be approximated
renormalized coupling constant squared and exact gluon propagator g2Ga1a2
µ1µ2
by the gluon propagator in the presence of homogeneous Abelian (anti-)self-dual ﬁeld. Radiative corrections due to
the gluon and ghost ﬁeld ﬂuctuations are neglected (for more details see Refs. [13, 22, 25]). It should be noted that
omitted radiative corrections can be represented in terms of the standard for pure gluodynamics set of Feynman graphs
for gluon polarization function but the internal lines in the graphs correspond to the gluon and ghost propagators in
the background ﬁeld B. In other words, the approximation in use corresponds to the lowest (tree level) order with
respect to perturbative ﬂuctuations Q, but the background ﬁeld (vacuum ﬁeld B) itself is taken into account exactly.
The randomness of domain ensemble is taken into account implicitly by means of averaging the nonlocal meson-
meson interaction vertices over all possible conﬁgurations of the homogeneous background ﬁeld at the ﬁnal stage of
derivation of the eﬀective meson action [22, 25].

It has to be
noted here that quark ﬁelds are seen as pure ﬂuctuations describable in terms of four-dimentional harmonic oscillator
eigenmodes of the bound state type [17, 23, 25] in R4. Interpretation of the quark ﬁeld in terms of point-like particle
is simply does not exist in the conﬁning background under consideration. Function G(z) originates from the gluon
propagator in the presence of the homogeneous Abelian (anti-)self-dual gluon ﬁeld [13]. It diﬀers from the free massless
scalar propagator by the Gaussian exponent, which completely changes the IR properties of the propagator but leaves
its UV asymptotic behaviour unchanged. In momentum representation it takes the form

It is important that nonzero gluon condensates (cid:104)g2F 2(cid:105) and (cid:104)g2| ˜F F|(cid:105) represented by the Abelian (anti-)self-dual
vacuum ﬁeld remove the pole from the propagator which can be treated as dynamical conﬁnement of the color
charged ﬁelds [15].

Here ”±” corresponds to self-dual and anti-self-dual background ﬁeld conﬁgurations. One can easily reconstruct
explicit form of functions HJ from Eq.(9). More detailed description of diﬀerent form factors, particularly the scalar
one, and their role in the chiral symmetry realization will be given in section V. This structure of the quark propagator
plays important role for successful description of the meson spectrum, especially for the ground state light mesons.
There are two equivalent ways to derive eﬀective meson action based on the functional integral (4) with the
interaction term L taken in the form (6). The ﬁrst one is bosonization of the functional integral in terms of bilocal
meson-like ﬁelds (see for example Ref. [28]). We shall return to this option in the discussion section. Another, more
elucidative way is to decompose the bilocal currents (5) over complete set of functions f nl

FIG. 4. Dependence of relative variation of the model parameters ∆N = |PN − PN−1|/PN−1 on the number of Laguerre
polynomials N taken into account during diagonalization of the quadratic part of the meson action with respect to the radial
number n. It can be seen that the iterations converge with N for all quantities faster than ∆N ≈ ∆1 exp(−.35N ) for N > 5.
For N = 7 the variations of light quark mass mu/d and coupling constant g slow down to one percent level, while the change
of the scale Λ and the strange quark mass ms approach a fraction of a percent. Alternations of the masses of heavy c and b
quarks and domain size R are not shown as it is of order of .1% or less for any N which is far smaller than the overall accuracy
of the model.

perform the orthogonal transformation of the auxiliary ﬁelds that diagonalizes the quadratic part of the action and,
ﬁnally, rescale the meson ﬁelds to provide the correct residue of the meson propagator at the pole corresponding to
its physical mass (if any). More details can be found in Ref. [13, 22, 25]. The result can be written in the following

Bar denotes integration over all conﬁgurations of the background ﬁelds. As it is illustrated in Fig.3, vertex functions
Γ(k) include, in general, several one-loop diagrams correlated via the background ﬁeld.
In the simpliﬁed model
of spherical domains, the n-point correlator Ξn(x1, . . . , xn) is given by a volume of overlap of n four-dimensional
hyperspheres [23, 25].

It has to be noted that though all Dirac structures, besides the vector and scalar ones, are nulliﬁed by the integration
of the propagator (10) over the background ﬁeld, all of them give highly nontrivial contribution to the quark loops
(products of several propagators). For example, the two-point correlators responsible for the mass spectrum contain
not only the one gluon (ﬂuctuation Q!) exchange interaction hidden in the vertex VQ but also additional S, P , V , A
and T interactions eﬀectively generated by the background gluon ﬁeld B.

It has to be stressed that the terms linear in meson ﬁelds are absent in (13). The linear terms naturally vanish for
all mesons besides the scalar ones, and their elimination for the scalar ﬁelds requires solution of an inﬁnite system of
equations

interesting details of the chiral symmetry realization in the presence of the background ﬁeld under consideration.

Explicit construction of ˜ΠQ(p2) will be discussed in the next section. Solution of Eq. (17) identiﬁes the position of the

hQ provides correct residue at the pole.

The free parameters of the model are the IR limits of the running renormalized strong coupling constant αs, quark
masses mu = md, ms, mc, mb, and the scales Λ and R. By construction, the coupling constant and the quark masses
correspond to the background Feynman gauge condition and momentum subtraction (MOM) renormalization scheme

It should be noted that decomposition (11) and (12) attributes the same radial form factor Fnl to the mesons with
diﬀerent spin-parity J. Moreover, the form of Fnl appears to be the same for all quarkonium-like collective excitations
with diﬀerent quark content and spin-parity such as π and J/ψ mesons. On the contrary, the physical meson states
correspond to the momentum dependent transformed basis and respectively transformed quark current

After diagonalization with respect to (n, n(cid:48)), function (21) contains information about the masses of all radial ex-
citations of light, heavy-light mesons and heavy quarkonia with J = S, P, V, A and zero orbital momentum l = 0.
One can see from Eq.(22) that expressions for ˜Πnn(cid:48)
J with the same spin but opposite parity diﬀer only in the sign
of the function F2 (second term in square brackets in (21)). This diﬀerence has a peculiar consequence for meson
spectrum. Real M 2 solutions of Eq.(17) for both scalar and axial mesons are absent, while pseudoscalar and vector
meson solutions exist irrespective to the quark content of a meson. In the present approach scalar and axial mesons
as quark-antiquark collective excitations analogous to the corresponding pseudoscalar and vector mesons are absent
in the spectrum. However, scalar and axial mesons naturally appear in the hyperﬁne splitting structures of the orbital
excitations of vector mesons [22]. For example, σ-meson as a plain analogue of π-meson is absent. The reason is
that the term in Eq.(21) proportional to the quark masses dominates both in the case of heavy and light quarks. For
heavy quarks it dominates just because of their large masses. For the light quarks, due to the contribution of zero
modes to the scalar part of quark propagator (9) this term dominates again. As a result, solutions to Eq.(17) for
scalar and axial states are absent in the whole range of the quark masses. Further below we will not discuss scalar
and axial mesons any more. The study of the spectrum of parity partners in a more detailed and systematic way than
the estimates of paper [22] has to be done. It will be presented elsewhere.

Solving Eq.(17) with completely (i.e. over radial and ﬂavour indices) diagonalized correlator one ﬁnds masses of η, η(cid:48)
and their excited states.
The values of parameters given in Table I were ﬁtted to the ground state of π, ρ, K, K∗, J/ψ, Υ and η(cid:48) mesons.
The ﬁt can be successfully done irrespective to the number N of radially excited states used for diagonalization of the
quadratic part of the action. However, the ﬁtted values of parameters depend on N . Figure 4 illustrates dependence
of relative variation of the model parameters on N . The iterations converge with N for all parameters faster than
∆N ≈ ∆1 exp(−.35N ) for N > 5. For N = 7 the variations of light quark mass mu/d and coupling constant g slow
down to one percent level, while the change of the scale Λ and the strange quark mass ms approach a fraction of a
percent. Parameters given in Table I and used for calculation of all masses and decay constants correspond to N = 7.

The results of computation of the masses of light mesons and their lowest radial excitations are given in Table II.
The rightmost column demonstrates behaviour of meson masses in the chiral limit as it has been deﬁned in [25]. Since
the quark masses here have the meaning of IR limit of the running eﬀective mass, the appropriate way to turn the
system into the chiral limit is to alter the masses of quarks mu/d and ms to the value ˜m

˜mu/d = ˜ms = ˜m = 136 MeV,

(25)

at which the light pseudoscalar octet mesons become massless. Then the current quark masses µf may be found as
diﬀerences

µu/d = mu/d − ˜m = 9 MeV, µs = ms − ˜m = 240 MeV.

Unlike the current masses themselves, their ratio is renormalization group invariant. The ratio takes the value

15

µs
µu/d

= 26.7,

that is close to the generally recognized value and just slightly diﬀers from the result of [25] where diagonalization
has been ignored.

It follows from Eq.(23) that in the chiral limit (25) a degeneracy emerges,

Ru/d(p2) = Rs(p2),

and according to Eq.(24) mixing between η0 and η8 disappears. The two-loop diagram contributes only to the
correlator of η0. As a result, η meson becomes massless simultaneously with pions and kaons, but the η(cid:48) meson stays
massive with a slightly reduced mass. This mechanism provides resolution of the UA(1) problem as it is seen in terms
of η(cid:48) mass. A basic scheme of simultaneous resolution of the UA(1) and the strong CP-problem in terms of the quark
eigenmodes was elaborated in papers [25, 27] within the spherical domain approximation.

Results of numerical calculation of the masses of ground state and two ﬁrst radial excitations of light, heavy-
light mesons and heavy quarkonia are given in Tables II, III and IV. Overall inaccuracy of description is less than
15% besides the second radial pion excitation π(1800) where it rises to 17%. It has to be stressed that there are
rigid asymptotic regimes which drive the three regions of meson spectrum [13, 22]: chiral symmetry breaking and
dynamical quark conﬁnement for the light mesons, proper Isgur-Wise limit for the case of heavy-light mesons and
correct UV behaviour of the gluon and quark propagators combined with the dynamical quark conﬁnement for the
heavy quarkonia.

Numerical values of transition constants are given in Table V. Though the masses of ρ and ω mesons are equal to
each other, their transition constants gV γ diﬀer due to isospin. Transition constants gV γ for heavy quarkonia turn
out to be underestimated. Though a clear reason for this has not been identiﬁed yet, it could be due to the necessity
to take into account larger N in calculations related to heavy quarkonia.

Numerical values of several leptonic decay constants are given in Table V. In agreement with general expectations
based on arguments related to the chiral symmetry breaking [33] and ﬁnite energy sum rules [34, 35], decay constants
are order of magnitude smaller for excited states than for the ground state mesons. In the present approach this sharp
P n/Λ2 ∼ 10, and naively
decrease is a highly nontrivial feature since the integrand in (27) includes exponents of M 2
one would expect large decay constants. However, the chiral symmetry realisation combined with the orthogonal
transformation O correctly leads to very small value.

V. DISCUSSION

In this section we touch on several issues which have not been fully elaborated yet but appear to be very important
as they allow one to identify the place of the present approach among other models of conﬁnement, chiral symmetry
breakdown and hadronization as well as the methods underlining them. These are potential interrelations of the
present approach to the soft wall AdS/QCD models, comparison of the properties of gluon correlator (8) with the
Landau gauge gluon and quark propagators as they appear in functional renormalization group, Schwinger-Dyson
Equations and lattice QCD, as well as details of chiral symmetry realization in the present approach. Some basic
properties of these approaches seem to be visible from the viewpoint of the present formalism.

are deﬁned by the action S2 via corresponding integral equation. Solution of this eigenfunction problem is equivalent
to diagonalization of the quadratic part of the eﬀective action in Eq.(14). Speciﬁc Gaussian form (7) of gluon
propagator D(z) is the reason for the radial part of the wave functions to be represented in terms of the generalized
Laguerre polynomials, see Eq. (11). The mass spectrum has Regge character [22].

which is a solution of the eigenfunction problem in diﬀerential form. The eigenvalues can be treated as the meson
masses squared, and they strictly correspond to Regge spectrum for the quadratic in z dilaton ﬁeld.

There are obvious diﬀerences between eﬀective action (28) and the soft wall AdS/QCD action. The ﬁfth space-time
coordinate z of AdS/QCD model appears in the present approach as a distance between quark and anti-quark. There
are four z-coordinates in (28), and hence the meson wave function contains angular part. Also it is not immediately
clear where AdS metrics could come from in Eq.(28). Apart from this, the feature in common is the Gaussian
weight function which in both cases plays the most important role for Regge character of the mass spectrum. After
integrating out z coordinate the quadratic part of the eﬀective meson action put on-shell (that is neglecting terms of
order (p2 − M 2)k with k ≥ 2),

One gets an impression that the form of dilaton proﬁle in soft wall AdS/QCD approach could be linked to the
gluon propagator and thus to the properties of QCD vacuum. A systematic veriﬁcation of this conjecture requires
derivation of the approximate (or reduced to some appropriate limit) diﬀerential form of the action (28). Weight and
basis functions of the domain model have to be systematically compared with those employed in soft-wall AdS/QCD
[7] and harmonic conﬁnement [2–6] approaches.

B. Gluon propagator: Landau gauge DSE, FRG, LQCD vs Abelian (anti-)self-dial ﬁeld

It is interesting to take a look at the properties of gluon (8) and quark (9) correlators in view of the known functional
form of quark and Landau gauge gluon propagators calculated within the functional renormalization group, Lattice
QCD and Dyson-Schwinger equations [36–41]. We do not intend to compare the propagators on a detailed quantitative
basis if for no other reason than diﬀerence in gauge condition. Unlike just mentioned studies, the present approach
have assumed background gauge condition so as renormalization of quark-gluon coupling constant is related to the
gluon ﬁeld renormalization. The tree level gluon propagator (8) without radiative corrections multiplied by the IR
limit of the running coupling constant αs(0) and corresponding ”dressing” function are shown by solid lines in Fig.7.
At large Euclidean momenta the propagator (solid line in LHS of Fig.7) behaves as the free one (1/p2) and the dressing
function approaches to a constant value (solid line in RHS of Fig.7). In order to model the logarithmic scaling at
short distances, one may divide the tree-level propagator by an appropriate logarithm1, which, for background gauge,
can be attributed to the eﬀective running coupling constant,

Here the form of logarithmic factor has been chosen to correspond to the form used in [39–41]. The result is shown
by the dashed lines in Fig.7. One can see that the propagator itself (LHS) is not that much aﬀected by taking into
account the short distance scaling. On the contrary, the dressing function is expectedly modiﬁed at large p2 (RHS).
The shape of modiﬁed by logarithmic scaling gluon correlator is in agreement with the result of ab initio numerical
calculations presented in [36–38] and a corresponding part of ad-hoc postulated input gluon propagator for the quark

factor in the ﬂuctuation gluon ﬁeld propagator (8) in the presence of the Abelian (anti-)self-dual nonperturbative
gluon ﬁelds. This factor is also responsible for the absence of a pole in the propagator which would correspond to
the colour charged particles in the spectrum. In the infra-red limit the dressing function behaves as p2/Λ2, where
scale Λ is exactly the same for the tree level (solid line) and UV-corrected (dashed line) dressing functions in Fig.7.
In our approach scale Λ, a gluon gap, is related to the scalar gluon condensate represented in terms of the Abelian
(anti-)self-dual vacuum ﬁelds. It is also notable that identiﬁcation of this gap with a kind of literally understood
gluon mass would be misleading.

1 We are grateful to Jan Pawlowski who has prompted us to model the short distance scaling of the dressing function in this manner.

C. Quark propagator, conﬁnement and chiral symmetry: DSE vs scaling in the Abelian (anti-)self-dial

background

Qualitative analysis of the scaling properties can be done with regard to the quark propagator. The tree level
propagator (9) takes into account the background Abelian (anti-)self-dual ﬁeld exactly and completely neglects per-
turbative radiative corrections. In this approximation the quark mass has a meaning of the IR limit of the eﬀective
running mass.
The propagator has complicated Dirac structure (10) which includes the complete set of Dirac matrices ΓJ with
corresponding form factors HJ (p2) (J = S, P , V , A, T ). For the case of constant quark mass m(0) functions HJ (p2)
and corresponding dressing functions p2HJ (p2) are shown in Fig.8. At large Euclidean momentum (short distance)
the scalar and vector dressing functions tend to unity while the rest of functions vanish quickly, and the propagator
approaches the free Dirac propagator with mass m(0).
If one switches on the momentum dependence of the quark masses and naturally assumes that m2(p) (cid:28) p2 at large
momenta p2 (cid:29) 1 (we use here dimensionless notation p2 = p2/2vΛ2, m2 = m2/2vΛ2 ) then the following simple

It should be stressed here that the ﬁrst leading terms in above equations have the standard perturbative form while
the subleading terms are purely nonperturbative, and they are suppressed by the Gaussian exponents. The squared
mass in the denominator of subleading terms in the last three form factors (J = S, P, T ) originate from the zero mode
contribution to the propagator. These terms are also ﬁnite since the scaling of the mass to zero value (in the absence
of the current masses!) is suppressed by the Gaussian factor if m2(p) > exp(−p2) at asymptotically large p2. In the
limit p2 → ∞ various dressing functions p2HJ of the quark propagator read

One can see that at large momenta the propagator approaches the standard Dirac propagator. For intermediate
values of momenta the dressing functions are shown in LHS of Fig.11. The RHS of this ﬁgure emphasizes that the
scalar part of the dressing function multiplied by the mass (see (10)) scales at large momentum as the running mass,
while pseudoscalar and tensor structures vanish.

Dimensionless notation p2/2vΛ2 → p2 is used.

As is illustrated in Fig.10 this equation has two solutions Φ0(αs) for any αs. The trivial solution Φ0 = 0 is absent
as the integral over s is singular in the limit Φ0 → 0 due to the contribution of zero modes. We see that there are
two contributions to the scalar condensate: the vacuum ﬁeld itself and the four-fermion interaction. Thus, due to the
Abelian (anti-)self-dual vacuum ﬁeld the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken for arbitrarily small four-fermion
interaction. For the values of strong coupling constant and scale given in the Table I, αs = 3.45 and Λ = 416 MeV, one
arrives at the estimate ¯m(0) = 166 MeV, which is not that diﬀerent from the value (25). It is also very important that
the quark propagator with the running mass of the form (30) remains an entire analytical function in the complex
p2 plane, and the dynamical conﬁnement property stays intact. Moreover, the propagator with the running mass
decreases both in Euclidean and Minkowski domains of p2, as it is illustrated in Fig.11. Similar shape of the scalar
and vector form factors was reported in Dyson-Schwinger approach [42] and interpreted in terms of the complex
conjugated poles of the quark propagator. However this is not a unique interpretation, as one may conclude from the
present consideration.

ﬂavours. Like equation (32), in the chiral limit this system of equations is free from divergences, both ultraviolet and
infrared (for discussion of analogous quark condensates see paper [43]). Complete solution of Eq.(16) should allow us
to use the current quark masses as free parameters instead of the infrared limit of the nonperturbative constituent
masses.

VI. SUMMARY

In the present approach, dependence of the light meson masses on radial quantum number n and orbital momentum
l has Regge character for n (cid:29) 1 or l (cid:29) 1 as it has been shown long time ago [13]. The source of Regge mass spectrum
in the model is the same as the source of dynamical colour conﬁnement – the impact of the Abelian (anti-)self-dual
background ﬁelds onto gluon and quark propagators resulting in the absence of singularities in propagators in the
whole complex momentum plane. Gaussian exponential dependence of propagators on momentum is of particular
importance for the strictly equidistant spectrum of M 2
nl (see a highly instructive consideration of the toy nonlocal
Kutkosky model in papers [44, 45]). Nondiagonal in radial number terms in the quadratic part of the action were
neglected in our previous estimations [22, 25]. Results of improved computation with proper diagonalisation is given
in Tables II, III, IV and V. Diagonalization signiﬁcantly changes the values of parameters of the model but does not
aﬀect main features of the model. The values of parameters given in Table I were ﬁtted to ground state mesons
π, ρ, K, K∗, η(cid:48), J/ψ, Υ. The rest of masses, decay and transition constants were computed straightforwardly without
further tuning of the parameters. In particular the same strong coupling constant was taken for light, heavy light
mesons and heavy quarkonia. Diagonalization in combination with chiral symmetry implementation turned out to
be crucial for computation of leptonic decay constants fP for radially excited states. In comparison with available
experimental data the overall accuracy of the model is about 11-15% (with very few exceptions like gV γ for heavy

In the Discussion section we have touched on several important issues related to the chiral symmetry implementation,
comparison with FRG and DSE results for propagators, and the interrelation of the present formalism with AdS/QCD
models. More systematic study of these problems will be presented elsewhere.
