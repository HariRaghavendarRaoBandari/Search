Abstract: We provide an analytical as well as a numerical study of the holographic s-wave
superconductors in Gauss-Bonnet gravity with Power-Maxwell electrodynamics. We limit
our study to the case where scalar and gauge ﬁelds do not have an eﬀect on the background
metric. We use a variational method, based on Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem for our
analytical study, as well as a numerical shooting method in order to compare with our
analytical results. Interestingly enough, we observe that unlike Born-Infeld-like nonlinear
electrodynamics which decrease the critical temperature compared to the linear Maxwell
ﬁeld, the Power-Maxwell electrodynamics is able to increase the critical temperature of the
holographic superconductors in the sublinear regime. We ﬁnd that requiring the ﬁnite value
for the gauge ﬁeld on the asymptotic boundary r → ∞, restricts the power parameter, q,
of the Power-Maxwell ﬁeld to be in the range 1/2 < q < (d − 1)/2. Our study indicates
that it is quite possible to make condensation easier as q decreases in its allowed range.
We also ﬁnd that for all values of q, the condensation can be aﬀected by the Gauss-Bonnet
coeﬃcient α. However, the presence of the Gauss-Bonnet term makes the transition slightly
harder. Finally, we obtain an analytic expression for the order parameter and thus obtain
the associated critical exponent near the phase transition. We ﬁnd that the critical exponent
has its universal value of β = 1/2 regardless of the parameters q, α as well as dimension d,
consistent with mean-ﬁeld values obtained in previous studies.

It has been well established that the correspondence between gravity in a d-dimensional
anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime and conformal ﬁeld theory (CFT) living on the (d − 1)-
dimensional boundary of the corresponding spacetime, provides a powerful tool to study
strongly coupled systems [1]. One of the intriguing applications of gauge/gravity duality
is to shed light on the open problems in condensed-matter physics. Understanding the
mechanism governing the high-temperature superconductor systems has been one of the
most important challenges in condensed-matter physics. The AdS/CFT correspondence
provides a new approach for calculating the properties of the superconductors using a
dual classical gravity description and may shed light on the pairing mechanism in high
temperature superconductors. Recently, it has been shown that some properties of strongly
coupled superconductors can be potentially described by classical general relativity living in
one higher dimension, which is known as holographic superconductors [2]. It was suggested
that the instability of the bulk black hole corresponds to a second order phase transition
from normal state to superconducting state which brings the spontaneous U (1) symmetry
breaking [3]. The ﬁrst holographic s-wave superconductor model known as Abelian-Higgs
model was proposed by Hartnoll et al., [2, 4]. This basically consists of a black hole and a
complex scalar ﬁeld minimally coupled to an Abelian gauge ﬁeld. It was observed that a
scalar hair is formed below a certain critical temperature, Tc, due to the breaking of a local
U (1) gauge symmetry near the black hole event horizon.

Following this novel idea by Hartnoll et al., [2], studies of holographic superconduc-
tors have attracted considerable attention and become an active ﬁeld of research. Con-
sequently, various aspects of the holographic superconductors, in the context of Einstein
gravity have been explored in the literature [5–12]. Generalization to other gravity theories
such as Gauss-Bonnet gravity have also been considered. For example, holographic su-
perconductors with various condensates in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity were explored in

– 1 –

[13]. A general class of holographic superconducting models with Gauss-Bonnet corrections
terms was studied in [14]. It was shown that diﬀerent values of Gauss-Bonnet correction
term and model parameters can determine the order of phase transitions and critical ex-
ponents of second-order phase transition [14]. Also, using the variational method for the
Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem, some properties of holographic superconductors with
Gauss-Bonnet gravity in probe limit were analytically calculated [15]. It was found that
the critical exponent of the condensation in Gauss-Bonnet gravity is β = 1/2 which is con-
sistent with mean-ﬁeld theory and previous studies[15]. Other studies on the holographic
superconductors in the framework of Gauss-Bonnet-AdS black holes were carried out in
[16, 17].

Most of the works mentioned above have been done with the gauge ﬁeld as a linear
Maxwell ﬁeld. However, it is interesting to investigate the eﬀects of nonlinear electrody-
namics on the properties of the holographic superconductor both in Einstein as well as
Gauss-Bonnet gravities. Considering three types of nonlinear electrodynamics, namely,
Born-Infeld, Logarithmic and Exponential nonlinear electrodynamics, and using numerical
methods, it has been observed that, in the Schwarzschild AdS black hole background, the
higher nonlinear electrodynamics corrections make the condensation harder [18]. The ef-
fects of an external magnetic ﬁeld on the holographic superconductors in the presence of
nonlinear corrections to the usual Maxwell action were examined in [19]. Analytical study
of holographic superconductors in Born-Infeld electrodynamics have been carried out in
[20]. When the background metric is the Gauss-Bonnet AdS black holes, several properties
of holographic s-wave superconductors with Born-Infeld electrodynamics were explored by
employing the Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem [21]. Performing explicit analytic com-
putations, Meissner-like eﬀect in the (4 + 1)-dimensional planar Gauss-Bonnet-AdS black
hole background with several nonlinear corrections to the gauge ﬁeld have also been studied
[22].

Applying the Sturm-Liouville analytical and numerical methods in the background of d-
dimensional Schwarzschild AdS black hole, the behavior of the holographic superconductors
have been explored by introducing a complex charged scalar ﬁeld coupled with a Power-
Maxwell ﬁeld, both in the probe limit [23] and in the presence of backreaction [24]. However,
the properties of the Gauss-Bonnet holographic superconductor from the Power-Maxwell
ﬁeld have not been explored yet. In this paper, we intend to extend the analytical study
of holographic superconductor, by taking into account both the higher order Gauss-Bonnet
curvature correction terms, as well as the nonlinear Power-Maxwell electrodynamics.
In
particular, we shall disclose the eﬀects of these correction terms on the critical temperature
of the superconductor and its condensation. Interestingly, we ﬁnd that the eﬀect of sublinear
Power-Maxwell ﬁeld can lead to the easing of condensation formation and consequently a
higher Tc.

This paper is outlined as follows: In the next section, we introduce the basic ﬁeld
equations of holographic superconductors in the background of Gauss-Bonnet AdS black
holes when the gauge ﬁeld is in the form of Power-Maxwell ﬁeld. In section 3, we use the
Sturm-Liouville method and obtain a relation between the critical temperature and charge
density, and show that Tc increases for some values of Power-Maxwell parameter. In section

– 2 –

4, we perform the numerical study and calculate the critical temperature by applying the
shooting method. We also compare our analytical and numerical results in this section.
In section 5, we calculate the critical exponent and the condensation values of the Power-
Maxwell holographic superconductor and show that it indeed has the universal value of
β = 1/2. The last section is devoted to concluding remarks.

2 Gauss-Bonnet holographic superconductors with Power-Maxwell ﬁeld

We consider the action of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-AdS gravity in d-dimensions,

(R2 − 4Rµν Rµν + RµνρσRµνρσi ,

(2.1)

where α is the Gauss-Bonnet coeﬃcient, Λ = −(d − 1)(d − 2)/(2l2) is the cosmological
constant of d-dimensional AdS spacetime with radius l. For simplicity, hereafter we set
l = 1. Since we consider the probe limit, the gauge and the scalar ﬁelds do not back
react on the background metric. The line element of the d-dimensional spacetime with ﬂat
horizon is written as [25]

ds2 = −f (r)dt2 + dr2

f (r) + r2dxidxi,

where r+ is the positive real root, f (r+) = 0. In the asymptotic region where r → ∞, we
have

f (r) ≈

(1 − √1 − 4α).

(2.4)

Here, the positivity of f (r) implies 0 ≤ α ≤ 1/4 and real. The Hawking temperature of
black hole on the horizon r+, which will be interpreted as the temperature of the CFT,
may be obtained as [13]

(2.7)

which has the form of Schwarzschild AdS black hole for r → ∞. Now, consider the action
of matter which is made of complex charged scalar ﬁeld in bulk, that minimally couples to
the Power-Maxwell ﬁeld:

Sm =Z ddx√−g(cid:2)−b(Fµν F µν)q − |∇ψ − iAψ|2 − m2|ψ|2(cid:3) ,

(2.8)

where F µν is the electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor, A and ψ are respectively, the gauge and
complex charged scalar ﬁeld. Here, b is a constant and q is the power parameter of the
Power-Maxwell ﬁeld. In the case where b → 1/4 and q → 1, the Power-Maxwell Lagrangian
will reduce to the Maxwell case. Throughout this work, we set the charge of the scalar
ﬁeld ψ equal to unity. Varying the matter action (2.8) with respect to the scalar and gauge
ﬁelds yield the following ﬁeld equations,

(∇µ − iAµ)(∇µ − iAµ)ψ − m2ψ = 0,

4bq∇νh(FσδF σδ)q−1F µνi − 2Aµ|ψ|2 + i(ψ∇µψ∗ − ψ∗∇µψ) = 0.

We shall assume ψ and φ to be real and only function of r, i.e., ψ=ψ(r) and A = φ(r)dt.
Thus, the equations of motion for the gauge and scalar ﬁelds can be written as,

(2.16)

According to AdS/CFT correspondence, ψ+ and ψ− are normalizable modes of the scalar
ﬁeld ψ which can be regarded as the source of the dual operator O, ψ− =< O− > and
ψ+ =< O+ >, respectively. Following [2, 4], we can impose the boundary condition in
which either ψ+ or ψ− vanishes, so that the theory is stable in the asymptotic AdS region.

– 4 –

It is worth noting that the gauge ﬁeld φ depends on the power parameter q of the Power-
Maxwell ﬁeld at the asymptotic AdS region (r → ∞). This is in contrast to the case of
holographic superconductor with other nonlinear electrodynamics such as Born-Infeld [20]
and Born-Infeld-like electrodynamics [18].

At the boundary where r → ∞, the gauge ﬁeld should have a ﬁnite value. Thus
Eq. (2.14) implies that d−2
2q−1 − 1 > 0, which restricts the values of q to be q < (d − 1)/2. On
the other hand since d−2
2q−1 > 1, it must then be a positive real number, which considering
that d − 2 > 0, implies that 2q − 1 > 0 or q > 1/2. We have therefore simply extracted the
meaningful range of the parameter q to be 1/2 < q < (d − 1)/2.

3 Critical temperature in terms of charge density

In this section, we obtain a relation between the critical temperature and charge density of
the holographic superconductor in Gauss-Bonnet-AdS black holes in the presence of Power-
Maxwell gauge ﬁeld. We shall use the Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem and limit our
study to the case where the scalar and gauge ﬁeld do not aﬀect on the background metric.
For this purpose, we ﬁrst transform the coordinate r to z, where z = r+/r. In this new

coordinate, the equations of motion (2.11) and (2.12) are rewritten as,

(3.2)

where the prime now indicates the derivative with respect to the new coordinate z. Very
close the critical temperature Tc, we have ψ → 0, which implies that the condensation
approaches zero. Therefore, Eq. (3.1) reduces to

φ′′ +(cid:18) 4q − d

2q − 1(cid:19) φ′

= 0.

(3.3)

Using the boundary conditions (2.13) and (2.14), one can easily show that, near the critical
temperature (r+ = r+c), Eq.(3.3) has a solution of the form

φ = ζr+c(cid:16)1 − z

It is a matter of calculations to convert Eq. (3.6) to the standard form of the Sturm-Liouville
equation,

Here ˜F1 is the Appell hypergeometric function [27] with two variables α and z. Expanding

We now provide a systematic presentation of the critical temperature as a function of
various variables and parameters. The critical temperature can change continuously as a
function of q in the allowed range. Therefore, in Fig. (1) we provide such a variation for
three diﬀerent values of α and two diﬀerent values of ˜m2 for d = 5. Clearly, increasing α
decreases the critical temperature. However, and more importantly, the critical temperature
is a decreasing function of q, indicating the possibility of easing the superconducting phase
transition with sublinear Power-Maxwell ﬁeld. It is also interesting to note that the behavior
of the critical temperature at both lower and upper bound of q. In the lower bound, where
the maximum occurs, the results are independent of both α as well as ˜m2. This can clearly

Figure 3: Rescaled critical temperature (Tc/ρ1/(d−2)) as a function of q for a ﬁxed value

be seen from Eq. (3.21) where γ becomes only a function of d in this limit. On the other
hand, the superconducting phase transition vanishes as q approaches its upper bound. This
can also be seen from Eq. (3.4) where the gauge ﬁeld vanishes for q → (d − 1)/2, where
ψ = 0 becomes the only solution. This is consistent with the understanding that the
electrostatic repulsion must overcome the gravitational attraction for the formation of the
scalar ﬁeld [28]. We also provide the same information in one higher dimensions, d = 6,
in Fig. (2), where the critical temperature now scales with ρ1/4. Here, the general trend
discussed above is the same except that the range of possible q values has increased and
that the transition point at the lower bound (q = 1/2) increases with increasing d. This is
also consistent with the general understanding that phase transitions are easier to achieve
in higher dimensional systems.

In order to more explicitly show the eﬀect of ˜m2, Fig. (3) provides such a plot for
(a) d = 5 and (b) d = 6, where one can clearly see that decreasing ˜m2 increases the
critical temperature for a given value of q. Furthermore, Fig. (4) shows the easing of
superconducting phase transition in a higher dimensional system.

4 Critical Temperature from numerical method

In this section, we propose to numerically study the critical behavior of the Power-Maxwell
holographic superconductor in Gauss-Bonnet gravity. For this purpose, we adopt the shoot-
ing method []. Let us note that Eqs. (2.11) and (2.12) remain unchanged under transfor-
mation

r → ar,

f → a2f,

φ → aφ,

ψ → ψ.

(4.1)

Taking advantages of this scaling symmetry, we can set r+ as unity in our numerical calcu-
lations and we can build dimensionless quantities such as T /ρ

1
d−2 .

Because we want to obtain critical temperature, we will take φ as (3.4). Thus the

Using the equation of motion for ψ, we can ﬁnd ψ′(1) and ψ′′(1) in the terms of ψ(1) which
is an arbitrary constant. Considering the fact that we are close to the critical point and
ψ is very small, we choose ψ(1) = 0.001. According to the shooting method, for speciﬁc

the horizon boundary with one shooting parameter ρ to get proper solutions at the inﬁnite
boundary. For speciﬁc values of ρ, boundary condition ψ− = 0 (or ψ+ = 0) is satisﬁed.
In Fig. (5), we plot ψ(z) for three ﬁrst critical charge densities for some values of q, ˜m2
and α in ﬁve dimensions. It is believed that the ﬁrst condensation occurs for the lowest
value of ρc and condensations due to higher values of ρc are not considered to be stable [28].

Having the lowest ρc and using dimensionless quantity T /ρ
d−2 , we easily obtain the critical
temperature for diﬀerent values of q and α. In Table 2 we compare the values of the critical
temperature from the numerical results based on shooting method with boundary condition
ψ− = 0 for ˜m2 = −3 with the analytical results obtained in the previous section. We see
that our analytical results obtained by Sturm-Liouville method are in good agreement with
the numerical results from shooting method.

5 Critical exponent

In this section, we propose to analytically calculate the critical exponent of the Gauss-
Bonnet holographic superconductor in the presence of the Power-Maxwell ﬁeld. Near the

First of all, we note that the solutions of Eq. (5.3) for χ(z) depend on the parameters d,
q and λi but are independent of r+ , Tc and T . Eq. (5.3) may not have an analytical
solution for all values of parameters q, d and λi but we only need χ|z→0 which can be found
numerically using the boundary conditions χ(1) = χ′(1) = 0 [31]. Thus, χ(z = 0) is just a
constant which does not include r+, Tc or T . Solving Eq. (5.8) for < Oi >, after using the
fact that χ(0) is a constant, one ﬁnds

It is worth noting that the result (5.14) holds for both the scalar operators < O+ > and
< O− > in the allowed ranges of the Power-Maxwell parameter 1/2 < q < (d − 1)/2 and
in arbitrary dimensions. It is obvious from (5.14) that the critical exponent of system is
equal to β = 1/2 which is consistent with the mean-ﬁeld value. This implies that neither
the higher curvature Gauss-Bonnet correction term nor the Power-Maxwell nonlinear elec-
trodynamics aﬀect the critical exponent of the holographic superconductors. This is not
surprising as the critical exponent is a universal feature of such theories. However, the
non-universal proportionality constant ( ˜AT λi

c r(cid:16) d−2

2q−1 − 1(cid:17)) depends on d as well as q. We

note that the behavior of this proportionally constant is somewhat suspect at q = 1/2. This
is not an allowed value, but we can get close to it arbitrarily. The more exact formula for
order parameter, Eq. (5.12), also display some limitation for q → 1/2 and/or T → 0 limit.

6 Concluding remarks

Based on the Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem, we analytically investigated the holo-
graphic s-wave superconductors with Power-Maxwell electrodynamics in the background
of Gauss-Bonnet AdS spacetime. Our main results are analytic expressions for the critical
temperature and order parameter (which gives the critical exponent) associated with the
superconducting phase transition. We provided a systematic illustration of the behavior
of the critical temperature as various parameters change. We also carried out a numerical
study of the critical temperature by using the shooting method. We conﬁrmed that the
analytical results obtained based on the Sturm-Liouville method are in good agreement
with the numerical results. The physically relevant range of Power-Maxwell parameter
1/2 < q < (d − 1)/2 is in focus here. Most importantly, and in contrast to various other
studies, we ﬁnd that the presence of nonlinear electrodynamics can lead to the easing of
the transition thus leading to higher critical temperatures for sublinear Power-Maxwell pa-
rameter q. On the other hand, the eﬀect of Gauss-Bonnet coeﬃcient α always lowers the
critical temperature. Also, transition is helped in higher dimensions. We ﬁnd that the crit-
ical exponent associated with the order parameter is not eﬀected by the main parameter
under consideration here, i.e, q, α and d.

Finally, we would like to mention that in this paper, we only considered the probe limit,
where the scalar and gauge ﬁelds do not back react on the metric background. It would be
interesting if one could consider the Gauss-Bonnet holographic superconductor from Power-
Maxwell ﬁeld away from the probe limit and take the backreaction into account. One may
also consider the case in which the Gauss-Bonnet coupling α is negative [32]. These issues
are currently under investigation and the results will be reported subsequently.
