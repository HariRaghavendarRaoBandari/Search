We calculate low-frequency gyrotropic spin excitation modes of the skyrmion ground state ul-
trathin cylindrical magnetic dots. The skyrmion is assumed to be stabilized at room temperature
and zero external magnetic ﬁeld due to an interplay of the isotropic and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya ex-
change interactions, perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and magnetostatic interaction. We consider
Bloch- and Neel-type magnetic skyrmions and assume that the dot magnetization does not depend
on the thickness coordinate. The skyrmion gyrotropic frequencies are calculated in GHz range as a
function of the skyrmion equilibrium radius, dot radius and the dot magnetic parameters. Recent
experiments on magnetic skyrmion gyrotropic dynamics in nanodots are discussed.

INTRODUCTION

Magnetic skyrmions received recently considerable at-
tention due to their unusual physical properties and
promising applications in nanoelectronics,
information
data storage, spintronics etc.1,2. Nanoscale dimensions,
considerable stability, high mobility, several controllable
parameters (polarity, chirality, topological charge) make
them attractive for the implementations in information
storage and processing devices on nanoscale.

Being a kind of magnetic topological solitons3 in 2D
spin systems, skyrmions exhibit a wide variety of unusual
properties that are related to their non-trivial topology.
The ﬁrst theoretical estimation of the stability of lo-
calized topological solitons in inﬁnite ferromagnets has
been presented by Dzyaloshinskii et al.4 Then, it was
noticed5 that the Dzyaloshinskii - Moriya exchange inter-
action (DMI) stabilizes 2D magnetic vortices (skyrmions
in modern terminology) in magnetic systems whose sym-
metry group lacks of the space inversion symmetry oper-
ation. Twenty years later 2D hexagonal skyrmion lattices
were experimentally detected in magnetic ﬁlms with bulk
(cubic B20 compounds, like MnSi, FeGe)6–8, and inter-
facial types9,10 of DMI. It is accepted that the bulk DMI
stabilizes Bloch skyrmions in B20 magnets6–8, whereas
the interfacial DMI leads to formation of Neel skyrmions9
in ultrathin multilayer ﬁlms. The B20 skyrmions are sta-
ble predominantly at low temperatures and ﬁnite mag-
netic ﬁelds6–9. However, metastable skyrmion lattices
can also exist at zero magnetic ﬁelds in thin epitaxial
FeGe ﬁlms8 and monolayer Fe ﬁlms on Ir(111) surface10.
and
experiments11–14showed that skyrmions can be stabi-
lized at room temperatures (RT) in ultrathin multilayer
structures deposited by sputtering (Co/Pt11–14, and
Ir/Co/Pt12,13),
including magnetic dots. Moreau-

single skyrmions are stabilized by chiral DMI. Very
recently, RT skyrmions were observed in bulk CoZnMn
in Fe/Ni/Cu/Ni/Cu multilayer ﬁlms16, and
alloys15,
in tri-layer stripes Ta/CoFeB/TaO17.
In the most
cases, the existence of magnetic skyrmions is related to
DMI. However, the alternative approaches referring to
artiﬁcial RT skyrmion crystals18–22, skyrmions stabilized
by perpendicular magnetic anisotropy23 without DMI,
dynamically stabilized skyrmions24, etc., have been also
developed.

The complex structure of magnetic skyrmions repre-
senting particle-like nanosize objects containing thou-
sands of spins results in their reach dynamics. A num-
ber of associated extraordinary ﬁndings including emer-
gent electromagnetic ﬁelds, topological Hall eﬀect, ul-
tralow densities of spin currents driving skyrmion mo-
tion, skyrmion breathing and rotation excitation modes
etc. were reported in recent years25–32.

Low and high frequency spin dynamics over a
skyrmion background being of particular interest has
been actively explored in 2D skyrmion lattices26–31.
Mochizuki26showed the existence of two in-plane ro-
tational eigenmodes (clockwise and anticlockwise) of
skyrmion spin texture unit cell and one breathing mode
(oscillations of the skyrmion radius) in the GHz fre-
quency range. Later on, the experiments detecting in-
ternal skyrmion modes have been carried out27–31. How-
ever, the microwave measurements27,28 conﬁrmed the ex-
istence of only one of the skyrmion rotating modes and a
breathing mode. Contrary, two rotating spin eigenmodes
and one breathing mode were detected by time-resolved
31. Very recent broadband
magneto-optics in Cu2OSeO3
ferromagnetic resonance measurements of MnSi, FeCoSi
30 showed existence of only two excitation
and Cu2OSeO3
modes in the spectra of these skyrmion crystals. There-
fore, there is no clear understanding of the B20 skyrmion
spin excitation modes to the moment.

To understand the complicated skyrmion spin exci-
tation spectra researches appeal to simpliﬁed systems:

netic ﬁlms and dots. Additional reason for that are
perspective applications of the RT isolated skyrmions in
nanoscale devices33.
Isolated skyrmions, conditions re-
quired for their existence in patterned ﬁlms11–14,23,34,35,
and the dynamics of isolated skyrmions in magnetic
ﬁlms and nanodots have been simulated29,33,36,37 and
experimentally explored38.

found one gyrotropic mode,
several breathing and
non-symmetric skyrmion shape modes in the area of
the skyrmion stability. The skyrmion gyrotropic mode
excited by the spin polarized current in a nanopillar was
simulated in Ref.33. Simulations of the skyrmion breath-
ing modes in cylindrical dots were presented in Ref.36.
Spin excitation spectrum in presence of the magnetic
vortex (half-skyrmion) ground state was investigated

magnetization in the
Similar classiﬁcation of the spin eigenmodes can be
applied to isolated skyrmions in magnetic dots and
inﬁnite ﬁlms. The spin waves on the Bloch skyrmion
background were recently calculated in Ref.37 within a
simple model.
In general, the skyrmion magnetization
oscillations can be represented as a superposition of
spin eigenmodes - spin waves and gyrotropic modes.
Gyrotropic modes correspond to translation motion of
the skyrmion center around its equilibrium position.
There are also standing and travelling spin waves
with quantized eigenfrequencies in a conﬁned system.
The frequencies of excited spin eigenmodes depend
on a variety of factors (system geometry (e.g., nan-
odot diameter), magnetic anisotropy, exchange etc.).
The experimental investigations of spin dynamics of
the RT isolated skyrmions are in a beginning stage.
Sometimes it appears to be diﬃcult to recognize exper-
imentally the type and origin of a particular skyrmion
excitation mode and a theoretical input is crucial. Two
spin excitation modes, presumably gyrotropic ones,
of magnetic bubble skyrmions in CoB/Pt multilayer
dots with CoB layer thickness of 0.4 nm were recently
measured by Buettner et al.38. They detected clockwise
(CW) and counterclockwise (CCW) rotating spin modes,
and an unusual pentagon like trajectory of the bubble
skyrmion core.

In this article we focus on skyrmion gyrotropic
excitation modes considering the skyrmion as a ground
state of thin cylindrical magnetic dot. We calcu-
late the mode eigenfrequencies within rigid skyrmion
model accounting the exchange, DMI, magnetostatic
interaction and uniaxial magnetic anisotropy. We
show that for the given dot parameters there exists
just one gyrotropic mode, which can be CCW or CW
depending on the skyrmion core magnetization direction.

portional to the Heisenberg exchange integral, K > 0
is the constant of uniaxial magnetic anisotropy, α, µ =
x, y, z, m = M /Ms is the unit magnetization vector, Ms
is the saturation magnetization, and Hm is the magne-
tostatic ﬁeld. The DMI term in Eq. (1) can be repre-
sented in two forms: 1. wD = D(m · rotm)1,9,25–31 and
D = D[mz(∇· m)− (m·∇)mz], see Refs.2,11–14,16,38
2. w∗
and references therein. Here D is the constant of the
Dzyaloshinskii Moriya exchange interaction. The ﬁrst
form is used for bulk DMI in the B20 cubic compounds
(MnSi, FeGe, etc.), and the second is used for interfa-
cial induced DMI in the case of an interface of ultra-
thin metallic ferromagnet with a nonmagnetic metal hav-
ing a strong spin orbit coupling2, i.e., Co/Pt, Co/Pd.
The DMI term w∗
D favors to stabilization of so-called
φ−skyrmions, where the skyrmion core and peripheries
are separated by a Bloch domain wall (Fig. 1a). The in-
terface DMI term leads to stabilization of ρ−skyrmions,
where the skyrmion core and peripheries are separated by
a Neel domain wall (Fig. 1b). The DMI is not of prin-
cipal importance for φ−skyrmions in dots, which can be
stable even at D = 023,38. However, the interface DMI
essentially contributes to the ρ−skyrmion stabilization
and dynamics, the skyrmions are not stable if the DMI
strength is lower than some critical value2,34.

It is convenient to rewrite the LL equation of motion
of the dot magnetization M (ρ, t) = M (ρ, X(t)) in the
form of Thiele equation of motion for the skyrmion core
position X = (X, Y ) in the dot via complex variables

the dot thickness, R is the dot radius, W = LR d2ρw is
the total dot magnetic energy, p = ±1 is the skyrmion
core polarization. The skyrmion magnetic energy can be
decomposed in series on small parameter |s| << 1 as
W (s) = W (0) + κ|s|2/2, where κ is the stiﬀness coef-
ﬁcient. Let us use the cylindrical coordinates (ρ, φ) to
describe the in-plane radius vector ρ(x, y). We assume
that the dot is thin enough, so there is no dependence
of the skyrmion magnetization on the thickness z- coor-
dinate and the φ− and ρ− skyrmion ground states are
clearly deﬁned. The problem is reduced to calculation

duced skyrmion radius, and the skyrmion phase is Φ0 =
Cπ/2 ( C = ±1 is the skyrmion chirality) for φ-skyrmion
or Φ0 = 0, π for ρ-skyrmion. To unify description of
φ- and ρ-skyrmions we deﬁne the generalized skyrmion
chirality C as follows. C = sign(mφ) = sin(Φ0) for φ-
skyrmions and C = sign(mρ) = cos(Φ0) for ρ-skyrmions.
The static DMI energy density is proportional to the
product DC, and is minimal at DC = −|D| < 0 deﬁning
the chiral skyrmion ground state. Nonzero DMI strength
lifts the energy degeneracy with respect to the skyrmion
chirality C. It is evident that in the exchange approxima-
tion (4) the DMI energy just renormalizes the isotropic

To calculate the skyrmion magnetostatic energy wm
we distinguish the energy of the bulk (non–zero for
ρ−skyrmions), side surface and face dot surface mag-
netic charges. The energy cannot be simply expressed
via the analytical function f (z), therefore, we used a di-
rect calculation of wm via the magnetization bulk divm
and surface divergence (m · n), where the vector n is
normal to the dot surface ( n = ˆz, ˆρ for the face and side
surface charges, correspondingly). The magnetostatic en-
ergy of the face and side surface charges of the displaced
skyrmion can be calculated by the equation

der Bessel function, f (x) = 1 − (1 − exp(−x))/x, and
β = L/R. Detailed calculations of the skyrmion magne-
tostatic energy will be published elsewhere. Here we note
that the bulk and side surface charges energies are pro-
portional to the small dot aspect ratio L/R and can be
neglected for ultrathin dots. Whereas, the face charges

the skyrmion displacement s. We use complex variables
z = (x + iy)/R and an analytic function f (z) to de-
scribe the skyrmion dynamics in 2D ferromagnet. The
linearized system of Eqs. (2) has the same form for the
φ−skyrmion and ρ−skyrmion backgrounds if the mag-
netostatic energy related to the volume and side surface
charges is neglected. The magnetization components can

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We calculated a low-frequency skyrmion dynamics of
ρ− and φ−skyrmions diﬀering by the type of a domain
wall (Bloch and Neel) in the skyrmion spin conﬁguration.
An ultrathin circular ferromagnetic dot with radius R
about of 100 nm and thickness L about of 1 nanometer
was considered. For such small dot thickness the magne-
tostatic energy is reduced to the magnetic energy of the
face charges, which can be accounted in the simpliﬁed
form of an eﬀective easy-plane anisotropy.

In the main approximation the skyrmion eigenmodes
can be conventionally divided into internal (low fre-
quency) and external (high frequency) modes. The in-
ternal modes related to weak skyrmion deformations are
localized close to the skyrmion center and include trans-
lation (gyrotropic) and breathing modes. The highfre-
quency spin wave modes are delocalized and occupy the
whole dot volume. We calculate the skyrmion spin ex-
citation modes that are closely related to the skyrmion
topological charge, i.e., translation or gyrotropic modes.
These collective spin modes correspond to the skyrmion
rotation around an equilibrium position corresponding
to minimum of the total magnetic energy. Based on
the Thiele collective coordinate approach we describe the
motion of skyrmion center position in a magnetic dot
within rigid skyrmion model accounting the exchange,
DMI, magnetostatic interactions and uniaxial magnetic
anisotropy, calculate the frequency of circular skyrmion
rotation (gyrotropic freq uency) and compare results with
recent experimental data and micromagnetic simulations.

The skyrmion gyrotropic frequency of ultrathin cylin-
drical dots given by Eq.
(11) is represented via the
skyrmion radius c. The equilibrium value of the skyrmion
radius c can be found using minimization of the total
magnetic energy given in Ref.23 within the ultrathin dot
limit L/R → 0 adding the DMI term by the substitu-
tion of the exchange stiﬀness A → A′ = A + DCRc/2.
The gyrotropic frequency (11) is proportional to the in-
verse in-plane magnetic susceptibility similarly to the
vortex gyrotropic frequency39 and is positive in the sta-
ble skyrmion state. Otherwise, the skyrmion will escape
from the dot lowering its energy. The line ωG(c) = 0
marks the border of the skyrmion stability within the
model. Accounting the reduced skyrmion radius c < 1
we note that if the DMI parameter d of any sign is
small (|d| < dc = 2Le/Rc) the skyrmion in an ultra-
thin dot is stabilized by the face magnetostatic inter-
action at moderate perpendicular anisotropy Q < 1.
This is typical for φ−skyrmions23,38, but is valid also for
ρ−skyrmions in ultrathin dots. If the parameter d is neg-
ative (d = −|d| < 0 corresponds to the skyrmion ground
state) and its magnitude is large (above the critical value
|d| > dc), then the ρ−skyrmions might be stabilized by
the DMI in ultrathin dots having a large perpendicular
anisotropy Q > 12,11–14. The gyrotropic frequency ωG
for such ρ−skyrmions decreases approximately as 1/R
at the dot radius R increasing. We note that the sim-
ilar dependence ωG(R) ≈ 1/R was calculated by Gus-
lienko et al.39 for the vortex gyrotropic frequency in thin
cylindrical dots due to the dominating magnetostatic in-
teraction. The φ− and ρ−skyrmion states are stable in
circular magnetic dots within some range of the param-
eters according to Refs.2,30,32. Estimation of the critical
value of the DMI parameter Dc = 2A/Rc using typi-
cal parameters A=10 pJ/m and Rc =10 nm yields Dc
= 2 mJ/m2 in good agreement with experiments12–14.
X-ray imaging of magnetic skyrmions in the ultrathin
multilayer circular dots Co/Pt11–14, Ir/Co/Pt12,13 and
CoB/Pt38 showed that the skyrmion radius Rc is sev-
eral tens of nm, much smaller than the dot radius and
the typical ratio c = Rc/R = 0.1 − 0.2 is small. This is
in some disagreement with micromagnetic simulations of
the ρ−skyrmion stability in the ultrathin circular dots,
where the larger values of c = 0.3−0.5 strongly dependent
on the DMI strength, dot radius2, and dot thickness14
have been found.

The positive skyrmion core polarization p = mz(0) cor-
responds to the counter clock-wise (CCW) skyrmion core
gyrotropic rotation and negative p = −1 corresponds
to the gyrotropic mode rotating clock-wise (CW). I.e.,
there is always only one gyrotropic mode for the given
skyrmion polarization p and corresponding sign of the gy-
rovector (see Theory). The second low-frequency mode
(CW for p = +1) simulated by Mochizuki26,32 cannot
be interpreted as a second gyrotropic eigenmode. In the
simulations26,32 the sign of p was determined by the sign
of the bias magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular to the ﬁlm plane.
It was noticed by Mochizuki et al.32 that the CCW low-

frequency mode has intensity much larger than intensity
of the higher-frequency CW mode.
I.e., the CCW gy-
rotropic mode is a sole resonance mode for p = +1, or
eigenmode of the system.

More precisely, moving skyrmion cannot be consid-
ered as an absolutely rigid object,
its dynamical pro-
ﬁle is deformed that can be represented as a hybridiza-
tion with azimuthal spin waves excited over the skyrmion
background37 and resulting in a ﬁnite skyrmion inertia
term in the Thiele equation of motion. The low fre-
quency gyrotropic eigenmodes are closely related to non-
zero skyrmion mass38,40. Recently two gyrotropic modes
in the CoB/Pt circular dots modes were simulated and
measured by X-ray imaging technique38. According to
the interpretation of Ref.38 existence of two gyrotropic
modes (rotating in opposite directions) corresponds to a
ﬁnite skyrmion mass. However, the second higher fre-
quency gyrotropic mode can be interpreted as azimuthal
spin wave37,39,40, and there is only one gyrotropic mode
in the dot spin excitation spectrum. Nevertheless, the
skyrmions can have a considerable mass accounting for
their magnetic energy change increasing skyrmion veloc-
ity. The skyrmion mass might also depend on mechanism
driving skyrmion motions (external ﬁeld gradient, tem-
perature, current, etc.).

We apply Eq.

(11) to estimate the gyrotropic fre-
quency of the bubble φ−skyrmion measured in Ref.38.
The dot radius is R=275 nm, Ms = 1190 G, Q=0.866,
and D = 0. Using the reduced value of A=15 pJ/m
typical for ultrathin Co-ﬁlms2,12,13,34 we get with these
parameters ωM /2π=43.5 GHz (assuming typical value
of γ/2π= 2.9 M Hz/Oe) and Le=14.5 nm. The total
magnetic material thickness is 12 nm (30 repeats of ul-
trathin CoB layer), and the magnetostatic energy in Eq.
(11) should be accounted more precisely. This energy for
displaced φ−skyrmion appears due to side surface mag-
netic charges and can be accounted by adding the term
F (β)(1 + c2) (see deﬁnition of the function F (β) in Sec.
2) to the square bracket in Eq. (11). The gyrotropic fre-
quency calculated by corrected Eq. (11) is equal to 1.11
GHz, whereas the value of 1.00 GHz was detected for
the low frequency CCW mode in Ref.39. The agreement
is reasonable good accounting that the relaxation time in
Ref.39 is comparable with the magnetization oscillation
period. That did not allow determining the skyrmion
eigenfrequencies with good accuracy and therefore, the
gyrotropic frequencies and skyrmion mass obtained in
Ref.39 are just semi-quantitative estimations.

The gyrotropic frequency of the skyrmion state ul-
(11) is plotted in Figure
trathin dots given by Eq.
2. It increases/decreases with dot radius increasing for
d > 0/d < 0 (Fig. 2a). However, the frequency at d > 0
decreases at R increasing if the side surface magnetostatic
interaction for a moderate dot thickness is accounted.
The eigenfrequency of the gyrotropic mode (11) is split-
ted due to DMI in the chiral φ− and ρ−skyrmion state
magnetic dots. There are two distinct gyrotropic fre-
quencies for the skyrmions due to possible diﬀerent signs

ity for ρ−skyrmions. The frequency splitting between
the corresponding gyromodes is determined by the DMI
strength ∆ωG(c) = ωM (L2
e|d|/R)c3/(1 + c2)2 and might
be of several hundred M Hz (see Fig. 2b). However, the
DMI energy for the skyrmion state dots is lower for such
sign of chirality that the parameter d = −|d| < 0 and
corresponding gyrotropic frequency is higher (the curve
2 in Fig. 2a,b). The gyrofrequency (11) is determined
by the exchange stiﬀness A, intrinsic DMI parameter D,
the perpendicular anisotropy constant K, as well as the
dot saturation magnetization and radius R. The recent

simulations by Zhang et al.33 of the gyrotropic dynam-
ics of the skyrmion in a free layer of circular nanopillar
are in qualitative agreement with Eq.
(11). There is
one gyrotropic frequency ωG(R), which rapidly decreases
from 1.4 GHz to zero with the dot radius R increas-
ing from 20 to 70 nm for Co dot with the thickness 0.6
nm (the magnetic parameters are the same as in Ref.2).
Eq. (11) for the gyrotropic frequency is applicable as
well to 2D skyrmion triangular lattices in B20 compounds
in the case of in-phase motions of the skyrmions in the
lattice unit cells (the dot diameter 2R should be substi-
tuted to the skyrmion lattice period in this case). The
eigenfrequency is about 1 GHz for typical B20 skyrmion
lattice parameters.

We note that the skyrmion gyrotropic frequency in
magnetic dots has not been observed yet. The reason
for that is the stable skyrmions in ultrathin ferromag-
netic dots were obtained very recently and there was no
chance to detect the skyrmion excitations in such mag-
netic nanostructures. Another diﬃculty we foresee is
large value of the magnetization damping (the resonance
linewidth) in ultrathin Co ﬁlms that does not allow ap-
plying a precise broadband ferromagnetic resonance tech-
nique for the gyrotropic frequencies detection in φ− and
ρ−skyrmion state magnetic dots. The ultrathin Fe/Ni
ﬁlms16 with expected low resonance linewidth are more
promising to detect the skyrmion dynamics. This is a

6

challenge for the future experiments.

IV. CONCLUSION

We calculated low-frequency gyrotropic spin excitation
modes of the skyrmion ground state cylindrical magnetic
dots. The skyrmion was assumed to be stabilized at
room temperature and zero external magnetic ﬁeld
due to interplay of the isotropic and Dzyaloshinskii-
Moriya exchange interactions, perpendicular magnetic
anisotropy and magnetostatic interaction. We consid-
ered the Bloch- and Neel-type magnetic skyrmions and
assumed that the magnetic dot is thin enough (magne-
tization does not depend on the thickness coordinate).
The skyrmion gyrotropic eigenfrequencies are calculated
within the rigid skyrmion model as a function of the
skyrmion equilibrium radius, dot radius and the dot
magnetic parameters. Now the challenge is to detect
experimentally the predicted gyrotropic eigenfrequncies.
