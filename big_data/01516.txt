Abstract

We demonstrate coherent control of multiphoton and above-threshold photoemission from a

single solid-state nanoemitter driven by a fundamental and a weak second harmonic laser pulse.

Depending on the relative phase of the two pulses, electron emission is modulated with a visibility

of up to 94%. Electron spectra reveal that all observed photon orders are aﬀected simultaneously

and similarly. We conﬁrm that photoemission takes place within 10 fs. Accompanying simulations

indicate that the current modulation with its large contrast results from two interfering quantum

pathways leading to electron emission.

Ionization by two-color laser ﬁelds with well-deﬁned relative phase allows one to tune

and control electronic dynamics on the (sub-) femtosecond time scale. By virtue of the

synthesized laser ﬁeld the energy and angular distributions of emitted electrons can be ma-

nipulated. Two-color pulses have been used in investigations of above-threshold ionization

of atoms [1–3], controlled ionization [4–6], dichroism [7, 8] and orientation of molecules [9].

Recently, they have also been applied to control interference fringes in the momentum dis-

tribution of electron emission [10–12]. In this letter we present exquisite coherent emission

control by simultaneous interaction of fundamental (ω) and second harmonic (2ω) femtosec-

ond laser pulses with condensed matter. Speciﬁcally, we control photoemission from an

individual nanotip.

While nanotips are nowadays routinely used as electron sources in high-resolution electron

microscopes [13], their superb transverse coherence known from DC ﬁeld emission has only

recently been observed in photoemission [14]. Field enhancement at the apex of nanotips

[15] conﬁnes and enhances electron emission, thus enabling the study of strong-ﬁeld physics

with moderate laser intensities well below the damage threshold [16–21]. Laser-induced

photoemission from tips (for extensive reviews see [22]) has already been employed in pulsed

electron guns for electron diﬀraction experiments [23, 24], while arrays of nanotips have lately

been fabricated and explored as electron sources for compact coherent x-ray production [25–
27]. Recently, a ω−2ω experiment was performed on a silicon tip array, but no phase-resolved
signal indicative of coherent control was reported [27].

In our experiment, atomic-scale in-situ control over the sample surface results in a well-

deﬁned nanoemitter that surpasses the limitations of focal averaging and inhomogeneous

broadening. We show that electron emission induced by a strong fundamental pulse can be

enhanced or suppressed with a contrast of up to 94% when superimposing a weak second

harmonic pulse. Accompanying simulations suggest that the strong modulation can be

explained in terms of two nearly perfectly constructively or destructively interfering quantum

pathways, each individually leading to electron emission.

We generate phase-locked pairs of fundamental and second harmonic pulses by passing

the output of an Er3+-doped femtosecond ﬁber laser through a 100 µm thick β-barium

borate (BBO) crystal (Fig. 1). Central wavelengths and pulse durations are 1560 nm and

74 fs for the fundamental and 780 nm and 64 fs for the second harmonic. The pulses are

sent into a Mach-Zehnder interferometer with dichroic beamsplitters where the delay (or,

FIG. 1. (Color online) Experimental setup. The second harmonic of Er3+-doped ﬁber laser pulses

is generated in BBO using oﬀ-axis parabolas (OAPs) for dispersion-free focusing and collimation.

Beams enter a Mach-Zehnder interferometer with dichroic beam splitters (DBS), where the funda-

mental passes a variable delay stage. Intensities are independently controlled with neutral density

wheels (ND) and the beams are spectrally ﬁltered (F1, F2). The polarization of the second har-

monic is rotated with a half-wave plate (WP). After recombination of the two pulses with variable

time delay τ they are focused onto a tungsten tip with an oﬀ-axis parabola (OAP). Electrons

are detected on a microchannel plate (MCP) or with a spectrometer using single electron pulse

counting.

equivalently, the relative optical phase) between the pulses can be varied by up to 2 ps by a

piezoelectric actuator and locked at any speciﬁc value [28]. A half-wave plate in the 2ω arm

rotates the 2ω polarization to align it with the ω polarization and the tip axis, unless stated

otherwise. Intensities can be adjusted independently by neutral density ﬁlter wheels. The

laser pulses are directed into a UHV chamber and focused onto a (310)-oriented tungsten

nanotip with a nominal work function of W0 = 4.31 eV [29]. With the applied bias voltage an
eﬀective barrier height of W ≈ 3.6 eV results. The tip’s radius of curvature is (10.2 ± 1.7)
nm determined in situ by ﬁeld ion microscopy [30] (see SI for details). Photoelectrons

from the biased tip are either counted directly at a microchannel plate (MCP) detector,

or, alternatively, pass an energy high-pass ﬁlter and are only then detected by the MCP,

enabling spectrally resolved measurements.

Typical peak near-ﬁeld intensities at the tip’s apex are on the order of Iω = 4·1011 W/cm2
for the fundamental and I2ω = 6 · 109 W/cm2 for the second harmonic, including ﬁeld en-
hancement [31, 32] (see SI for details). The near-ﬁelds of both colors result in electron

emission in the multi-photon regime with minimum Keldysh parameters γ = pW0/2Up of

γω,min = 4.8 and γ2ω,min = 53, where Up is the ponderomotive energy. The second harmonic

is a weak perturbation with the ratio of second harmonic to fundamental near-ﬁeld peak
intensity I2ω/Iω ≤ 4%. Electron emission induced exclusively by a pulse at frequency ω is
observed to be at least more than one order of magnitude larger than electron emission by

a 2ω-pulse.

In regions of temporal overlap of the ω and 2ω pulses we observe a dramatic change in the

emission characteristics: The emitted current strongly oscillates as a function of the delay

(central region of Fig. 2(a), magniﬁed in panel (b)). This behavior is well described by a

sine ﬁt (red solid line). The contrast is up to 94%, i.e., electron emission is either drastically

enhanced or reduced to almost zero as compared to the emission from the tip for separated

pulses. Despite the weak 2ω intensity admixture of 2 % the maximum achievable electron

current is almost four times the current for separated pulses for these parameters.

For further analysis we Fourier transform the data of Fig. 2(a) and obtain the spectrum

shown in Fig. 2(c). On top of a white noise background the Fourier spectra for overlapping

pulses feature two main peaks: a low-frequency (DC) component in region of interest 0

(ROI 0) and a component at ﬁnite frequency (ROI 1) peaking at 390 THz, the frequency

of the second harmonic. A windowed inverse Fourier transform of the data in ROI 0 and

ROI 1 and an additional Hilbert transform of the data in ROI 1 to obtain its envelope

yield the temporal variation of the amplitude of the ROI 0 and ROI 1 components as

a function of the delay τ (Fig. 2(d)). These can be well approximated by Gaussian ﬁts
Gi(τ ) = Ai + Bi exp(−4 ln 2τ 2/∆2
i ). Here i = 0, 1 for ROI 0 and ROI 1, τ denotes the ω − 2ω
delay, and ∆i are the full widths at half maximum of the photocurrent components. The

ROI amplitude ﬁt parameters Bi serve as direct measure of the cooperative eﬀects in the

region of temporal overlap.

We ﬁnd that B0 and B1 scale diﬀerently with the second harmonic intensity I2ω. While
B0 increases linearly with I2ω, B1 shows a √I2ω dependence (Fig. 2(e)). The contrast of the
oscillating current signal, i.e. its visibility

determined from sine ﬁts reaches up to 94% for an intensity admixture of the 2ω-component

of 2% to the fundamental near-ﬁeld intensity of Iω = 330 GW/cm2 (Fig. 2(e)). For admix-

tures of 4% an additional Fourier component at 4ω emerges from the background indicating

the onset of a new interaction process. We therefore exclude the data point at I2ω = 14

GW/cm2 from the following analysis.

The cooperative electron emission also varies as a function of the orientation of the inci-

dent polarization vector of the second harmonic pulse (Fig. 2(f)). The maximum cooperative

eﬀect is found for the 2ω polarization aligned with the ω component, which is parallel with

the tip axis. Rotating the incident 2ω polarization vector the cooperative electron emission

is reduced and reaches its minimum for the 2ω polarization perpendicular to the tip axis.

This is expected as the near-ﬁeld excited by the 2ω ﬁeld is strongest for an incident polar-

ization aligned with the tip axis and also overlaps best with the near-ﬁeld excited by the

fundamental. For an incident polarization vector orthogonal to the tip axis its enhanced

region is moved away from the tip apex [33], so away from the low-workfunction (310) plane.

To gain further insight into the underlying processes we have recorded electron-energy

spectra (Fig. 3) when either one of the two pulses is blocked or both are simultaneously

present. With only the 2ω pulse on target (blue line) we observe only a weak two-photon

emission current. By contrast, with only the fundamental pulse present (black line) a typical

above-threshold photoemission (ATP) spectrum containing many orders appears [17]. For

overlapping ω and 2ω pulses and for the pulse delay locked to minimum (green) and max-

imum (red) all photon orders reach their minimum or maximum synchronously. Moreover,

the variation of the peak height relative to the ATP spectrum for the ω pulse only is almost

independent of the photon order.

Since all photon orders show maxima and minima at the same relative optical phase with

the same relative amplitude (see Fig. 3), we can describe the total emitted current with

just two eﬀective emission pathways (see SI). The emitted current from fundamental alone
(≈ A0) scales with I 4
ω despite the presence of higher photon orders. Thus, eﬀective emission
pathway 1 with rate R1 corresponds to the absorption of four photons of the fundamental.

Eﬀective pathway 2 involves the absorption of two photons of the fundamental and one

photon of the second harmonic resulting in electron emission with rate R2. The interference

term between the two paths R12 oscillates with the relative phase between the pathways,
φ(τ ) = φ2ω − 2φω − φe, which we control via the adjustable pulse delay τ . φe denotes the
unknown phase relation of the electronic states connected by the optical transition. It is

easy to see that this model predicts the following dependences on the intensities:

where α and β are proportionality factors for the absorption of ω and 2ω photons, respec-

tively. We identify the cooperative contribution to B0 with pathway R2 and the amplitude

of the oscillation B1 with R12.

The parameters α and β can be extracted by comparing our experimental data with
the quantum-pathway interference model introduced above. Evaluating R1 (∝ α4) from
the observed count rate with the fundamental at Iω = 330 GW/cm2 alone we ﬁnd α4 =
(8.068 ± 0.080) · 10−43 Hz cm8 W−4. Evaluating R2 to extract α2β from the scaling of B0
with second harmonic intensity in Fig. 2(e) yields α2β = (1.22 ± 0.15) · 10−29 Hz cm6 W−3.
From these results for α4 and α2β we can directly obtain the prefactor for the interference
term R12, yielding 2α3√β = (6.27 ± 0.38) · 10−36 Hz cm7 W−3.5. This factor can also
be derived independently from the scaling of B1 with I2ω (Fig. 2(e)), which yields 2α3√β =
(5.70±0.52)·10−36 Hz cm7 W−3.5. The excellent agreement of the two independently obtained
values for 2α3√β is a strong indication that our simple model captures the essential features
of the two-color ionization process well.

Fig. 2(e) shows the visibility V (Iω, I2ω) calculated using the quantum-pathway interference

model (black dotted line) together with the experimental data points (Eq. 1). Again, excel-

lent agreement between the model and the experimental data is found.

On the other hand, as expected for the multi-photon regime, a simple strong-ﬁeld physics

model for photoemission at nanotips [19] fails to describe our results. The ionization prob-

ability of electrons near the Fermi edge bound by the (reduced) work function W directly

tunneling through the surface barrier would display an exponential variation with the am-

plitude of the superimposed ﬁelds (in atomic units)

rather than the observed sinusoidal variation with the ω−2ω phase φ(τ ) (Fig. 2(b)). Interest-
ingly, also a one-dimensional time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) simulation

for a jellium with the experimental work function, that has previously yielded good agree-

ment with the experiment for the strong-ﬁeld plateau of rescattered electrons at higher ﬁeld
intensities (Iω ≈ 1013 W/cm2) [19], fails to reproduce the sinusoidal variation, even though
multiphoton processes are included in this model. Instead, it predicts emission rates as a
function of the ω − 2ω phase that are similar to the dependence of the tunneling rate (Eq. 6,
see also SI).

In a 3D ground-state density functional theory (DFT) calculation for the W(310) surface

we observe a strong modulation of the local density of states (LDOS) below the vacuum
√E of the jellium model (Fig. 4, see SI for details).
level compared to the smooth ρ ∝
Of importance appear the pronounced peaks in the vicinity of EF + 2ω and in particular

EF + 4ω. These broad peaks can act as doorway states resonantly enhancing multiphoton

emission compared to the prediction of the jellium model. Their presence supports the

quantum-pathway interference model for reaching the short-lived resonance at EF + 4ω,

from where photoemission proceeds.

The lifetime of excited states is limited by their spectral width, by the presence of the

optical ﬁeld, which ionizes them, and by diﬀusion of the electron to the bulk. From our

experiment we can determine an upper bound for the lifetime of involved intermediate

states to be less than 10 fs. This can be concluded from the full width at half maximum
of the photocurrent components, which are (78 ± 10) fs for ROI 0 and (84 ± 10) fs for ROI
1, determined from the Gaussian ﬁts to the data in Fig. 2. These are slightly shorter than

the expected cooperative signals from a simple convolution of the laser pulses for all applied

intensities. The symmetry of the photocurrent components of ROI 0 and ROI 1 as a function

of the pulse delay is another indicator of a short lifetime.

In summary, we have demonstrated quantum-pathway interference in multiphoton and

above-threshold photoemission at a tungsten tip on femtosecond time scales with two-color

femtosecond driving ﬁelds. Despite the solid-state nature of the emitter, the maximum

modulation depth of 94% is among the highest reported values for two-color coherent control

experiments, including isolated atoms in the gas phase [34]. This high visibility is closely

related to the nanometer-sized interaction volume, preventing the inﬂuence of focal averaging

eﬀects and inhomogeneous broadening. Nanotips may therefore be used as nanometric

probes to measure light phases [35]. Moreover, we demonstrate a potential building block

for the development of lightwave electronics [36] on the femtosecond duration and nanometer

9

length scales. Additionally, we expect that polarization-shaped [37] two-color laser pulses

together with the polarization-sensitive near-ﬁeld distribution [33], the spatially-dependent

work function on the nanometer scale, and the Gouy phase shift will permit engineered

spatiotemporal electron emission proﬁles at single tips and tip arrays, highly desired for use

in electron guns for coherent x-ray generation [25].
