IDEALS ON THE QUANTUM PLANE’S JET SPACE

ANDREY GLUBOKOV

The goal of this paper is to introduce some rings that play the role of the
jet spaces of the quantum plane and unlike the quantum plane itself possess
interesting nontrivial prime ideals. We will prove some results (theorems 1-4)
about the prime spectrum of these rings.

1. Introduction

According to the classical perception of plane geometry the aﬃne plane corresponds to
the algebra freely generated by two variables x and y subject to the trivial commutation
relation yx = xy. When the commutation relation yx = xy is replaced by yx = qxy the
resulting algebra is called the quantum plane[1],[2].

Objects like ”planes” are expected to possess some analogue of ”curves”. But the quan-
tum plane possesses very few prime ideals. The idea of the paper is to look at certain rings
that play the role of jet spaces of the quantum planes. This is done by introducing new
”jet” variables in the style of Kolchin’s diﬀerential algebra[3] and by considering commu-
tation relations among these variables which are compatible with the action of the natural
derivations on these rings. These are the multiplicative relations unlike the ones of Weyl
type considered in particular in [4]. It turns out these new rings possess plenty of prime
ideals which are related to the (commutative) geometry of Pn × Pn, n ≥ 1

2. Background and Motivation.

2.1. Quantum Symmetry (basic example). It is well-known that symmetry plays an
important role in modern mathematics and theoretical physics. Gauge symmetry leads
to the Standard Model in high energy physics; crystallographic space symmetry is funda-
mental to solid state physics, conformal symmetry is crucial to string theory and critical
phenomenon. In a sense, the progress of modern physics is accompanied by study of sym-
metry.

The mathematical counterpart of all the above mentioned symmetries and other popular
ones is group. Recently there has been great interest in the study of quantum group and
quantum symmetry. Quantum group in contrast to its literal meaning is not a group,
even not a semi-group. However a quantum group is the deformation of the universal
enveloping algebra of a ﬁnite-dimensional semi-simple Lie algebra introduced by Drinfeld
[5]and Jimbo[6] in their study of the Yang-Baxter equation.

The word ”quantum” in quantum group is from the Yang-Baxter equation: solutions of
the classical Yang-Baxter equation are closely related with classical or semi-simple groups,
while solutions of the quantum Yang-Baxter equation related with quantum groups. The
quantum thus really diﬀers from the canonical quantization and possesses diﬀerent mean-
ings for diﬀerent systems. Conventionally, quantum group is a Hopf algebra which is
neither commutative nor cocommutative. A Hopf algebra is endowed with the algebra
homomorphisms: comultiplication ∆ and counit ε, and the algebra anti-homomorphism:
the antipode S.

Quantum group theory has been developed in diﬀerent directions.

In the quantum
space approach [1], the initial object is a quadratic algebra which is considered being as
the polynomial algebra on a quantum linear space. Quantum group appears like a group
of automorphisms of the quantum linear space.

The basic example is a Quantum Group GLq(2). Let k be a ground ﬁeld, q ∈ k∗. By
deﬁnition, the ring of polynomial functions F = F [GLq(2)] is a Hopf algebra which can be
described in the following way. As a k−algebra, it is generated by a, b, c, d and a formal
inverse of the central element

D = DETq(cid:18) a b

c d (cid:19) = ad − q−1bc

where a, b, c, d satisfy the following commutation relations:

ab = q−1ba
ac = q−1ca
cd = q−1dc
bd = q−1db
bc = cb

The comultiplication ∆ : F → F ⊗ F is deﬁned by

ad − da = (q−1 − q)bc

∆(cid:18) a b

c d (cid:19) =(cid:18) a b

c d (cid:19)
c d (cid:19) ⊗(cid:18) a b

where the tensor product in the r.h.s. denotes the usual product of matrices in which

products like ab are replaced by a ⊗ b . The counit is given by

The antipode map S : F → F is

c d (cid:19) =(cid:18) 1 0
0 1 (cid:19)

ε(cid:18) a b
c d (cid:19) = D−1(cid:18) d

−c/q a

S(cid:18) a b

−qb

(cid:19)

It can be checked directly that all these structures are well deﬁned and satisfy the Hopf
algebra axioms.

3. Quantum plane: Gauss Polynomials and the q-Binomial Formula.

Deﬁnition. Let k be a ﬁeld . Let q 6= 1 be an invertible element of the ground ﬁeld
k and let Iq be the two-sided ideal of the free algebra k < x, y > of noncommutative
polynomials in x and y generated by the element f = yx − qxy. The quantum plane is
deﬁned as the quotient algebra k<x,y>
. For future developments, we need to compute the
powers of x + y in the quantum plane. To this end we have to consider Gauss polynomials..
Gauss polynomials are polynomials in one variable q whose values at q = 1 are equal to

Iq

the classical binomial coeﬃcients. For any integer n > 0 , set

(n)q = 1 + q + q2 + ... + qn−1 =

qn − 1
q − 1

Deﬁne the q−factorial of n by (0)!q = 1 and

(n)!q = (1)q(2)q...(n)q =

(q − 1)(q2 − 1)...(qn − 1)

(q − 1)n

when n > 0. The q−factorial is a polynomial in q with integral coeﬃcients and with value
at q = 1 equal to the usual factorial n!. We deﬁne the Gauss polynomials for 0 ≤ k ≤ n by

(cid:18)n
k(cid:19)q

=

(n)!q

(k)!q(n − k)!q

with following properties:

k(cid:1)qis a polynomial in q with integral coeﬃcients and with value at q = 1 equal to

Finally for all n > 0,

c). q−analog of the Chu-Vandermonde formula, for m ≥ p ≥ n,we have

In particular, if q is a root of unity of order p > 0,
(x + y)p = xp + yp

Let z be a variable commuting with q.The q−exponential can be deﬁned as following

formal series:

such that eq(x + y) = eq(x)eq(y)

eq(z) =Xn≥0

ANDREY GLUBOKOV

In this paper q will eventually be assumed not a root of unity. However some of the
results can be extended to the case when q is a root of unity in which case the q−binomial
formulae become relevant.

4. Quantum plane and Quantum Group.

A more conceptual approach to GLq(2) consists in introducing quantum plane k<x,y>

Iq
and obtaining the commutation relations of GLq(2) from the following matrix relations:

y′(cid:19) =(cid:18) a b
(cid:18)x′
y ′′(cid:19) =(cid:18) a c
(cid:18)x′′

c d (cid:19)(cid:18)x
y(cid:19)
b d (cid:19)(cid:18)x
y(cid:19)

such that x′, y′ and x′′, y′′ are on Quantum Plane and

y′x′ = qx′y′
y′′x′′ = qx′′y′′

In this way, GLq(2) emerges merely as a quantum automorphism group of noncommu-

tative linear space.

5. The problem and the main results

The family of prime ideals of the quantum plane has a simple structure as we shall
presently review. Recall that an ideal P is prime if P 6= (1) and if from ab ∈ P it follows that

a ∈ P or b ∈ P. We denote by Spec B the set of prime ideals in any ring B. Spec(cid:16) k<x,y>
Iq (cid:17)

consists of the following prime ideals: {< 0 >, < x, y >, < x − α, y >, < x, y − β >} where
α, β ∈ k×and < S > denotes the two-sided ideal generated by set S.

Due to the commutation relation yx = qxy the above set of ideals can be rewritten as

{< 0 >< x, y >, < x − α >, < y − β >} since, for example,

y(x − α) − q(x − α)y = (q − 1)αy

so y ∈< x − α > and < x − α, y >=< x − α > .

The fact that the ring structure of the quantum plane is so trivial prevents us from consid-
ering ”curves” on it . That is a motivation to attempt to introduce new rings that play the
role of the jet spaces of the quantum plane and possess interesting nontrivial prime ideals.
Let us consider the noncommutative ring B(n) = k < x, x′, x′′, ..., x(n), y, y′, y′′, ...y(n) >
where x′, x′′, ..., x(n), y′, y′′, ...y(n) are new indeterminates. Consider the unique k−derivation
δ : B(n−1) → B(n) sending δx = x′, δx′ = x′′, ....and δy = y′, δy′ = y′′, ... Recall that a
k−derivation δ is a k−linear map satisfying the usual Leibniz rule: δ(F G) = δF G + F δG

Deﬁne the following elements of B(1) :
g1 = y′x − qxy′
g2 = yx′ − qx′y
g3 = y′x′ − qx′y′

IDEALS ON THE QUANTUM PLANE’S JET SPACE

Hence δf = g1 + g2
Also deﬁne
h = xx′ − x′x, h = yy′ − y′y and, more generally, deﬁne the following elements of B(n) :
hij = x(i)x(j) − x(j)x(i)
hij = y(i)y(j) − y(j)y(i)
gij = y(i)x(j) − qx(j)y(i)for integers i, j ≤ n. Finally, deﬁne A(n) =

B(n)

<f,hij ,hij ,gij >

For further purposes we deﬁne the commutative ring A(n)

c = k[x, x′, x′′, ..., x(n), y, y′, y′′, ...y(n)]

which is the ring of the usual(commutative) polynomials. Any monomial xio (x′)i1 (x′′)i2
... (x(n))in yj0(y′)j1 (y′′)j2 ...(y(n))jnhas the bi-degree (i, j) where the total degree in

Let us recall the previously deﬁned derivation δ : B(n−1) → B(n). Let A = lim−→ A(n). Then
δ induces a k−derivation δ : A → A. For each n we have x(n) = δx(n−1) and y(n) = δy(n−1)

6. δ−prime ideals

6

ANDREY GLUBOKOV

Deﬁne a δ−prime ideal to be a prime ideal P such that δP ⊂ P. As in Theorem 3 let

T = {f ∈ P |f is bi-homogeneous } so P =< T >

We can prove the following Proposition:

δP ⊂ P ⇐⇒ δT ⊂ T

Proof.
Implication =⇒: δT ⊂ δP ∩ {bi-homogenious elements of A} ⊂ P ∩ {bi-homogenious

elements of A} = T

The ⇐= part follows because if f ∈ P then

so

δf =Xi

αifiβi, fi ∈ T

f =Xi
δαifiβi +Xi

αiδfiβi +Xi

αifiδβi

Since δT ⊂ T , then δf ∈< T >= P

7. Appendix

For the proofs of theorems 1-4 we need the following deﬁnition of the lexicographical

ordering in N2

(a, b) ≤ (c, d) ⇐⇒(cid:26) either a < c

or a = c , b ≤ d (cid:27)

Let’s consider a polynomial g ∈ A(n) Write g =Pij gij, such that gij is bi-homogeneous

of bi-degree (i, j). Let’s consider the set Γg = {(i, j), gij 6= 0} ⊂ N2. The size of a polyno-
mial g in A(n) is size(g)= #Γg , number of points in Γg. If gij has the bi-degree (i, j) then
gijx has the bi-degree (i + 1, j) and ygij has bi-degree (i, j + 1). The size of gx and yg will
stay the same as the size of g.

Lemma 1. If h = yg − qνgy and (ν, µ) ∈ Γg , then the size of Γh will be strictly less

than the size of Γg.

Indeed,

.

h = yg − qνgy = yXij

gij − qνXij

gijy =Xij

gijy(qi − qν)

It follows that all points of Γgwith the ﬁrst coordinate equal to ν will disappear in Γh

and the size of Γh will be strictly less than the size of Γg.

Similarly, if h = gx − qµxg and (ν, µ) ∈ Γg, then the size of Γh will be strictly less than

the size of Γg.

7.1. Proof of Theorem 1. We start by showing the following claim:
there exists a
nonzero bi-homogeneous polynomial in P. Indeed take 0 6= g ∈ P of smallest possible size.
We claim that size(g) = 1 which means g is bi-homogeneous. Assume that size(g) ≥ 2

Case 1. g is not homogeneous in x, x′, ..., x(n).
Let’s consider g = yg − qνgy ∈ P such that there is at least one term with total degree
in x, x′, ..., x(n) equal to ν. Since g is not homogeneous in x, x′, ..., x(n), g 6= 0. On the other
hand by the Lemma we have #Γg < #Γg which contradicts the minimality of size(g).

Case 2. g is homogeneous in x, x′, ..., x(n) but not in y, y′, ....y(n).
Let’s consider ˆg = gx − qµxg ∈ P such that there is at least one term in g with the total
degree in y, y′, ....y(m) equal to µ. Since g is not homogeneous in y, y′, ....y(n), ˆg 6= 0. On
the other hand by the Lemma we have #Γˆg < #Γg which contradicts with minimality of
size(g)

This proves our claim. To conclude the proof of the Theorem 1, using our claim one
can pick a nonzero bi-homogeneous polynomial f ∈ P of smallest bi-degree (i∗, j∗) with
respect to lexicographical order among the nonzero bi-homogeneous polynomials in P .

We claim that f is irreducible in A(n)
If we assume it is not, then f = g ·c h, g, h ∈ A(n)
Write:

.

c

, ( g, h /∈ k)

c

g = Xij
h = Xij

gij ,gij bi-homogeneous of bidegree (i, j)

hij, hij bi-homogeneous of bidegree (i, j)

Note the following properties of bi-degrees:

1. bideg(gi1j1 · hi2j2) = (i1 + i2, j1 + j2)
2.

If (i1, j1) < (i0, j0)
and (k1, l1) ≤ (k0, l0)

then (i1 + k1, j1 + l1) < (i0 + k0, j0 + l0)

Let (i0, j0) be the highest element of Γg with respect to lexicographical order, (k0, l0)
be the highest element of Γh with respect to lexicographical order. and let (i1, j1) be the
lowest element of Γg, (k1, l1) be the lowest element of Γh

Then the highest element of Γg ·ch will be (i0 +k0, j0 +l0) and the lowest element of Γg ·ch
will be (i1 + k1, j1 + l1). Since f = g ·c h we have (i0 + k0, j0 + l0) = (i1 + k1, j1 + l1) = (i∗, j∗)
Since i∗ = i0 + k0 = i1 + k1and i0 ≥ i1 it follows that i0 = i1 because if i0 > i1 then k0
has to be less then k1 which contradicts with the choice of k0. It immediately follows that
k0 = k1. Similarly, j0 = j1 and l0 = l1, so g and h are both bi-homogeneous of degrees less
than (i∗, j∗).

Since P is a prime ideal, at least one of them belongs to P. This contradicts the choice

of f.

We prove by induction on the total degree N in x, x′, ..., x(n), y, y′, ....y(n) that if f has

Let N be the total degree of f. We have that from g · h ∈< f >it follows that g ·

Since f is bi-homogeneous, Pi αif βi = Pi αiβiqnif =Pi γif = γf, for some ni, γi, γ.

γ = Xij

of η is (cid:0)k, l(cid:1))

Let (i0, j0) be the highest element of Γg with respect to lexicographical order, (k0, l0) be

the highest element of Γh and (m0, n0) be the highest element of Γγ. Then

gi0j0 · hk0l0 = γm0n0 · f

qtgi0j0 ·c hk0l0 = qsγm0n0 ·c f

for some t and s.
Since f is irreducible in the commutative ring A(n)

, it follows that gi0j0 = η ·c f = q−liη ·f
(f is bi-homogeneous and the bi-degree of η is (k, l) ) or hk0l0 = η ·c f = q−liη · f (bi-degree

c

Assume, for example, the former is the case. From gh = γf we get (g − gi0j0 + gi0j0) · h =
(g − gi0j0) · h + gi0j0 · h = g′ · h + qwη · f · h where g′ = g − gi0j0.Obviously, g′ · h ∈< f > .
Since the total degree in x, x′, ..., x(n), y, y′, ....y(m)of g′ · h is less or equal to N − 1, by
the induction hypothesis either g′ ∈< f >and g = g′ + qwη · f ∈< f >or h ∈< f > and we
are done.

7.3. Proof of the theorem 3. It is obvious that < T >⊂ P.

To prove < T >⊃ P assume on the contrary that P does not belong to < T > . Let
f ∈ P \ < T > be of minimal size. Since by this assumption f cannot be bi-homogeneous
the size(f ) > 1. There are two cases.

Case1. f is not homogeneous in x, x′, ..., x(n). Write f = Pst fst. For an arbitrary

(k, l) ∈ Γf .

There exists a pair (i, j) ∈ Γf such that i 6= k otherwise f ought to be homogeneous in

x, x′, ..., x(n).

Let h = yf − qif y ∈ P.

Then by the Lemma 1 size(h) < size(f ). It follows that h ∈< T > so h can be written

as

h = γ1B1 + γ2B2 + ... + γmBm

where Bl

Let us pick out the bi-homogeneous components of bi-degree (k, l + 1). Then λki ·fkl ·y =

Also h =Pst(yfst − qifsty) =Pst λsifsty, where λsi = qs − qi.
eγ1B1 + eγ2B2 + ... + fγmBm ∈< T > where eγ1,fγ2,....,fγm are bi-homogeneous. Since λki 6= 0

because i 6= k, we have fkl · y ∈< T > . So fkl · y ∈ P

Similarly let h(s) = y(s)f − qif y(s) . As above we get fkl · y(s) ∈ P for all s. Since
< y, y′, ....y(n) > is not contained in P it follows that at least one of y(s) /∈ P. Because P
is prime, fkl ∈ P. But fkl is obviously bi-homogeneous so fkl ∈< T >

Since the pair (k, l) is arbitrary it follows that f =Pst fst ∈< T > - a contradiction.

Case 2. f is homogeneous in x, x′, ..., x(n) but not in y, y′, ....y(n). Write

f =Xt

fkt

For an arbitrary (k, l) ∈ Γf . there exists a pair (k, j) ∈ Γf such that l 6= j otherwise f

ought to be homogeneous in y, y′, ....y(n).

Let h = f x − qjxf ∈ P. Then by the Lemma 1 size(h) < size(f ). It follows that

h ∈< T > so h can be written as

h = γ1B1 + γ2B2 + ... + γmBm

where Bl

∈ P and bi-homogeneous .

Also h = Pt(fktx − qjxfkt) = Pt λtjfkty, where λsi = qt − qj. Let us pick out the bi-
homogeneous components of bi-degree (k +1, l). Then λlj ·x·fkl = eγ1B1 +eγ2B2 +...+fγmBm
∈< T > where eγ1,fγ2,....,fγm are bi-homogeneous.

Since λlj 6= 0 because ofl 6= j, we have x · fkl ∈< T >, so x · fkl ∈ P
Similarly let h(s) = f x(s) − qjx(s)f . As above we get x(s) · fkl ∈ P for all s. Since
< x, x′, ..., x(n) > is not contained in P it follows that at least one of x(s) /∈ P. Since P
is prime, fkl ∈ P, but fkl is obviously bi-homogeneous so fkl ∈< T > . The pair (k, l) is

arbitrary so it follows that f =Pst fst ∈< T > - a contradiction.

7.4. Proof. of Theorem 4.a . Let us consider the factor ideal
