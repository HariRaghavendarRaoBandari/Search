Relying on generalized-gradient and hybrid ﬁrst-principles simulations, this work provides a com-
plete characterization of the electronic properties of ZnO ultra-thin ﬁlms, cut along the Body-
Centered-Tetragonal(010), Cubane(100), h-BN(0001), Zinc-Blende(110), Wurtzite(1010) and (0001)
orientations. The characteristics of the local densities of states are analyzed in terms of the reduction
of the Madelung potential on under-coordinated atoms and surface states/resonances appearing at
the top of the VB and bottom of the CB. The gap width in the ﬁlms is found to be larger than
in the corresponding bulks, which is assigned to quantum conﬁnement eﬀects. The components of
the high frequency dielectric constant are determined and the absorption spectra of the ﬁlms are
computed. They display speciﬁc features just above the absorption threshold due to transitions from
or to the surface resonances. This study provides a ﬁrst understanding of ﬁnite size eﬀects on the
electronic properties of ZnO thin ﬁlms and a benchmark which is expected to foster experimental
characterization of ultra-thin ﬁlms via spectroscopic techniques.

INTRODUCTION

vestigated in detail.

Zinc oxide is a wide-gap semiconductor1 of technolog-
ical importance, widely used for its semiconducting and
optical properties.
It can be grown under a wide va-
riety of nanoparticle shapes and sizes or as thin ﬁlms,
with many potential applications in the ﬁelds of catal-
ysis, gas sensors, photoelectric devices or transparent
electronics2–4. This richness of applications partly comes
from the existence of many structural polymorphs, with
rather close formation energies. While wurtzite (WUR)
is its structural ground state under normal conditions,
ZnO has also been prediceted to adopt zinc-blende (ZB),
body-centred tetragonal (BCT), cubane (CUB) or hexag-
onal Boron Nitride (h-BN) structures, depending upon
the conditions of formation5–9.

In these polymorphs, the zinc and oxygen atoms ex-
perience diﬀerent environments, especially when some
reduction of dimensionality takes place, which may
strongly modify the electronic properties. Bulk gap
widths and densities of states (DOS) have been scruti-
nized by ﬁrst principles simulations10,11 and we have re-
cently disentangled the eﬀects of band narrowing and of
electrostatics in the modiﬁcations of quasi particle, ab-
sorption and electron energy loss spectra12.

Beyond bulk properties, the possibility of tuning elec-
tronic and optical properties through a reduction of di-
mensionality has fostered advances in the fabrication and
structural characterization of ZnO nanostructures13–19
and thin ﬁlms on various substrates20–30, with a range
of techniques and under a variety of experimental con-
ditions. In particular in ultra-thin ﬁlms, theoretical and
experimental works indicate important variations of the
atomic structure as a function of thickness31–34. How-
ever, to which extent the electronic properties are af-
fected by these structural changes has not yet been in-

In the present work, we focus on the electronic proper-
ties of ZnO thin-ﬁlms with four monolayer (4ML) thick-
ness, cut along the BCT(010), CUB(100), h-BN(0001),
ZB(110), WUR(1010) and (0001) orientations. We ana-
lyze the gap widths, the layer-projected density of states
and the optical properties. We are able to highlight the
role of surface under-coordinated atoms in determining
the largest modiﬁcations of these properties with respect
to the corresponding bulk structures.

The structure of the paper is the following. After a
description of the numerical approach (Section II), we
stress the main structural characteristics which will be of
importance for the understanding of the electronic prop-
erties (Section III). We then analyze the DOS character-
istics, with special emphasis on electrostatic eﬀects, and
we discuss the gap widths (Section IV). Optical dielec-
tric functions and absorption spectra are the subject of
Section V, before the conclusion.

II. METHOD

All ground state calculations are performed within the
framework of the Density Functional Theory (DFT), us-
ing the projector augmented wave method35,36, and a
plane wave basis set, as implemented in VASP37. Va-
lence electrons are 2s and 2p for oxygen, 3d and 4s
for zinc. The Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof (PBE)
generalized-gradient approximation38 is systematically
used for structural optimization, while electronic prop-
erties are computed with the range-separated hybrid
HSE03 exchange-correlation functional39. The use of the
HSE03 functional is meant to improve the PBE under-
estimation of the band gap in semiconductors and insu-
lators and the excessive delocalization of d electrons. It

is especially useful for the simulation of compounds with
full or empty d shells, to the description of which the
DFT+U approach is less eﬃcient.

Slabs of 4ML40 have been designed for each struc-
ture and orientation, with approximately 12 ˚A of empty
space to prevent spurious interactions between replicated
slabs. Dipole correction is applied to slabs with two non-
equivalent terminations. The energy cutoﬀ is 500 eV
and the k-point grids, centered at Γ, used to sample the
Brillouin zone of the (1 × 1) surface cell, are 5x7x1 for
BCT(010), 4x4x1 for CUB(100), 8x8x1 for h-BN(0001),
8x6x1 for WUR(10¯10), 8x8x1 for ZB(110) and 6x6x1 for
WUR(0001). Cell optimization is stopped when all forces
get lower than 0.01 eV/˚A and in-plane components of the
stress tensor below 0.01 eV/˚A3. This setting leads to con-
verged values of the cell-parameters within 0.01 ˚A and of
the total energies within 0.01 eV per formula unit. Only
the ideal BCT structure (a = b) is considered.

Optical properties are computed within the linear re-
sponse theory, in which the response to a perturbing ﬁeld
is described by the complex dielectric function (q, ω) =
1(q, ω) + i2(q, ω) (ω the energy of the perturbation and
q the exchanged momentum which tends to zero for inter-
action with light). In the random phase approximation41
(RPA), and under the assumption of an homogeneous
medium (neglect of local ﬁelds), the dielectric function
(q, ω) = 1− 4πχ0(q, ω)/|q|2 is expressed in terms of the
macroscopic component of the independent particle po-
larizability χ0(q, ω), that we compute as the weighted
sum over all transitions42,43 from occupied to empty
(HSE03) Kohn-Sham states, thus neglecting excitonic ef-
fects. Within such approximations, the absorption spec-
trum is given by A(ω) = limq→0 2(q, ω). Depending on
the Cartesian direction along which the limit is taken,
the spectra along x, y or z direction are computed (z
perpendicular to the surface). The dielectric constant
limq→0 1(q, 0) is computed via Kramers Kronig relations
from the imaginary part 2(q, ω). The sum over all tran-
sitions has been cut at 30 eV and ﬁner k-point grids (all
centered in Γ) are used: 12x9x1 for WUR(10¯10), 9x12x1
for BCT(010), 9x9x1 for CUB(100) and 12x12x1 for the
remaining three structures.

III. STRUCTURAL PROPERTIES

This section is devoted to a description of the main
structural characteristics of the 4ML ﬁlms, with a special
emphasis on those which will be of importance for under-
standing the electronic properties. For each polymorph,
we have considered the ﬁlm orientation which has the
lowest energy, i.e. BCT(010), CUB(100), h-BN(0001),
ZB(110) and WUR(1010)31,44. We have also considered
the WUR(0001) polar orientation, with a reconstructed
(2 × 2) surface conﬁguration in which one oxygen (resp.
zinc) atom upon 4 is removed on the oxygen (resp. zinc)
termination. This is the conventional method to reduce
the build-up of a macroscopic dipole. The 2D unit cells

of these 4ML ﬁlms are sketched in Figure 1. The sur-
face unit cells display diﬀerent symmetries: square for
CUB(100), hexagonal
in the case of h-BN(0001) and
WUR(0001), and rectangular for BCT(010), WUR(10¯10)
and ZB(110). At the ﬁlm surfaces, some atoms are under-
coordinated. We label them U1 and U2 according to
whether they are directly in contact with vacuum or im-
mediately sub-surface. Internal atoms are labeled I, as
sketched in Figure 1. In the h-BN(0001) ﬁlms, U2 atoms
do not exist. In the case of WUR(0001), there are two
types of sub-surface atoms with diﬀerent local environ-
ments: three atoms (labeled U3 in the following) are adja-
cent to the surface vacancy while the fourth one (labeled
U2) is not.

A feature shared by all ﬁlms except h-BN(0001) is

3

the expansion of the lateral lattice parameters, with re-
spect to bulk. This eﬀect is caused by a ﬂattening of
the surface layers, evidenced by an increase in the aver-
age surface bond angle (cid:104)α(cid:105). This is the so-called rota-
tional relaxation mechanism, well-known at the surface
of semiconductors46,47.
It induces a contraction of the
structure in the perpendicular direction, to preserve the
atomic volumes. However, in the present case, it does not
preclude some simultaneous bond contraction. In the h-
BN(0001) ﬁlm, since the layers are already ﬂat, surface
bond breaking only induces a contraction of the in-plane
parameters, which leads to an expansion in the perpen-
dicular direction.

More detailed analysis (Table III in Section IV) shows
that, in all structures, under-coordinated atoms U1 or U3
have lost one ﬁrst neighbor and between 3 and 5 second
neighbors, while atoms U2 have a complete ﬁrst coordi-
nation shell and a second coordination shell reduced by
1 to 3 units. The average Zn-O bond-lengths around U1
and U3 atoms are reduced by approximately 0.1 ˚A (see
Table I in Supplemental Material48). In all cases, I atoms
have complete ﬁrst and second coordination shells, and
the bond relaxation around them is quasi-negligible in
average.

Finally, in Table I, we give the angle θ between the ab
plane and the plane which contains the three ﬁrst neigh-
bors of U1 atoms. This angle measures the projection
of the dangling bond located on U1 atoms on the z axis
perpendicular to the surface, and thus characterizes the
mixing of pz with px, py orbitals in the surface dangling
bonds.

IV. ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE

In this section, we discuss the electronic character-
istics, obtained by using the hybrid HSE03 exchange-
correlation functional on top of the PBE structural
ground state of the ﬁlms. The relevant characteristics
include the main DOS structures in the valence (VB)
and conduction (CB) bands, and the gap width. We re-
late their modiﬁcations with respect to their respective
bulks to changes in the local environment of the surface
atoms.

A. Characteristics of the local densities of states

Figure 2 displays the local densities of states (LDOS)
of the six ﬁlms, projected on internal layers (I atoms),
surface atoms of type U1 and sub-surface atoms of type
U2 or U3.

The overall DOS shape is similar for all polymorphs.
At the very bottom of the VB, two peaks with nearly
O 2s and Zn 3d character, respectively, are found, lower
in energy than the oxygen band, formed by the O1 peak
(∼ −5 eV) due to Zn 4s-O 2p bonding states, and the O2
region (from Fermi level to about -4 eV), associated to

4

delocalized nature of the orbitals involved, except in the
two WUR ﬁlms for which the S and P2 peaks of the U1
and U2 LDOS are shifted towards higher energies. Close
to the VB and CB band edges, there is a clear enhance-
ment of the surface LDOS on under-coordinated atoms,
but, considering the orbital overlap between surface and
sub-surface atoms and the small width of the ﬁlms, it
is diﬃcult to discriminate between actual surface states
and surface resonances. In the CB, for all polymorphs,
surface resonances mainly localized on U1 and U2 atoms
are present from approximately 2 to 4 eV above the CB
minimum. The CB minimum itself involves orbitals on
all atoms of the ﬁlms, except in the WUR(0001) ﬁlm,
where there is a well-deﬁned surface state on U3 atoms.
In the VB, surface resonances with strong U1 and
U2 oxygen pz character and to a lesser extent I oxy-
gen orbitals are present in all polymorphs in an en-
ergy range from 0.2 to ≈ 1 eV below the top of the
VB. At the extreme top of the VB true surface states
with U1/U3 and U2 oxygen px and py character are
present, with a degree of hybridization with pz orbitals
which increases in the series: h-BN(0001), WUR(0001),
BCT(010), WUR(10¯10), CUB(100), ZB(110) (see Figure
1 in Supplemental Material48). As expected, the evolu-
tion of the degree of hybridization follows the variations
of the angle θ between the U1 dangling bond orientation
and the direction z perpendicular to the surface which in-
creases in the series (Table I). The relationship between
these VB LDOS characteristics, the absorption spectra
and the optical dielectric function will be discussed in
Section V.

More remarkable are the diﬀerences between internal
and surface LDOS involving localized O2s and Zn3d or-
bitals in the valence band. Figure 2 evidences a sys-
tematic shift towards higher energies (blue-shift) for the
former and towards lower energies (red-shift) for the lat-
ter on the U1 or U3 atoms, while the opposite is true on
U2 atoms. These shifts are given in Table III and are
related to the modiﬁcations of the electrostatic potential
on under-coordinated atoms, to be discussed below.

B. Electrostatic eﬀects

LDOS characteristics, especially as far as localized
states are concerned, may be understood by consider-
ing the electrostatic potentials49 VO and VZn acting on
the various oxygen and zinc atoms of the ﬁlms. They
include long range contributions, but their variations
among nonequivalent atoms are mainly related to lo-
cal environments (i.e.
to the variations δN1 and δN2
of the numbers of ﬁrst and second neighbors). Table
III records the diﬀerences δVO and δVZn of electrostatic
potentials between under-coordinated surface atoms and
fully-coordinated internal atoms.

On U1/U3 atoms, the negative sign of δVO and the pos-
itive sign of δVZn indicate a decrease (in absolute value)
of the electrostatic potential, as expected from the loss

dashed-dotted green lines, respectively.

Zn 3d-O 2p anti-bonding states and O-O hybridization.
In the conduction band, beyond the extended onset re-
gion, three zones can be identiﬁed: the S zone, mainly
formed by O 2p - Zn 4s anti-bonding states, the P1 zone,
formed by states with mixed Zn p and Zn s character,
and the P2 zone at higher energy, with predominant Zn
p orbital component. The average positions of the most
noticeable structures are reported in Table II, together
with a comparison of gap widths Eg between the bulks
and the ﬁlms.

There is a close resemblance between the LDOS shapes
that are found on the internal I atoms and those in the
bulk, displayed in our previous work12. The tiny diﬀer-
ences, in particular the splitting of the Zn d-state due to
the crystal ﬁeld which is somewhat blurred in some ﬁlms,
result from the long range electrostatic and/or covalent
interactions existing in ZnO, which are partly cut in the
ﬁlms.

As far as LDOS on surface atoms U1, U2 or U3 are con-
cerned, it is diﬃcult to ﬁnd systematic characteristics of
the S, P1 or P2 peaks in the CB, likely because of the

Within a Hartree or Hartree-Fock approximation, the
diagonal matrix elements of the Hamiltonian/Fock oper-
ator on an atomic orbital basis set have a contribution
−Vi due to the electrostatic potential50,51. Applied to
ZnO ﬁlms, the decrease of |δV | on U1 and U3 atoms thus
pushes their O 2s levels towards higher energies and their
Zn 3d levels towards lower energies. Conversely, the in-
crease of |δV | on U2 atoms pushes their O 2s levels and
their Zn 3d levels in the opposite direction. Figure 3
shows that the correlation is quantitatively obeyed, for
all under-coordinated atoms.

of one ﬁrst neighbor. The eﬀect is modulated by longer
range interactions and by the length of the broken bond.
For example, in the h-BN ﬁlm, which has a quasi lay-
ered structure, the bonds which are broken at the sur-
face are very long and do not induce strong modiﬁca-
tions of electrostatic potential. Consequently, the latter
is mostly determined by the in-plane arrangement, which
does not change from plane to plane. In WUR(1010) and
(0001), BCT(010), ZB(110) and CUB(100) ﬁlms, δVO
and δVZn are quite noticeable. WUR(0001) ﬁlm displays
the largest potential variations, which we will discuss sep-
arately. Conversely, as far as U2 atoms are concerned, the
signs of δVO and δVZn are opposite to those on U1 and
U3, consistently with no loss of ﬁrst neighbors (of op-
posite charge) and a decrease in the number of second
neighbors (of same charge).

sitions with respect to I of the Zn3d and O 2s LDOS peaks

text).

The reduction of electrostatic potential on U1/U3
atoms is also responsible for the presence of strong sur-
face states/resonances in the top part of the VB and the
bottom part of the CB. However, the hybridized charac-
ter of these states makes the correlation between their
positions and the reduction of electrostatic potential less
quantitative than for the more localized O 2s and Zn 3d
states, and the precise surface geometry also plays a role.

with a substantial admixing with I atom orbitals, despite

tures corresponding to surface resonances may be found

character. In ZB(110) ﬁlms, little oxygen-oxygen bond-
ing exists within the surface layer, so that the states at
the very top of the VB have a resonance, not a surface
state, character. As well recognized at the surface of ZB
semi-conductors, the buckling of the surface dimers which
pushes oxygens outwards and tends to transform the sp3
bonding into sp2 hybridization pushes back the dangling
bond surface state into the VB. In the h-BN(0001) ﬁlm,
all layers being nearly identical from an electronic point
of view due to the extremely weak interlayer coupling
(reﬂected in the weak δVO and δVZn values), VB states
display a mixed character between U1 and I orbitals.
Finally, the largest electrostatic potential variations are
found at the surface of WUR(0001) on U3 atoms. They
induce the presence of surface states with px, py charac-
ter, not only at the top of the VB but also at the bottom
of the CB.

As shown in Table III, in WUR(0001), there is a sur-
prisingly large diﬀerence in δVO and δVZn values be-
tween U1 and U3 atoms, while their local environments
present the same reduction of ﬁrst neighbors and a not so
much diﬀerent reduction of second neighbors. Remem-
bering that atoms U1 and U3 are of same chemical nature
and are located at opposite ﬁlm terminations, we assign
the diﬀerence to a residual electrostatic dipole, due to
an incomplete compensation of polarity. Indeed, at the
WUR(0001) semi-inﬁnite polar surface, it is usually con-
sidered that the removal of one fourth of surface ions
does heal polarity because the ratio of successive inter-
layer distances R1/(R1 + R2) is close to 1/4. However
this statement neglects the fact that the R1/(R1 + R2)
ratio is not exactly equal to 1/4.
It also neglects the
polarization of electronic origin, which exists in the non-
centro-symmetric wurtzite structure. Moreover, in the
4ML ﬁlm, ﬁnite size eﬀects have to be taken into account,
which modify the criterion of polarity compensation52,53.
This interpretation is further conﬁrmed by an analo-
gous simulation of a 4ML ZB(111) ﬁlm. Since along the
ZB(111) polar orientation R1/(R1 + R2) = 1/4 and since
there is no spontaneous polarization in the ZB centro-
symmetric structure, the removal of one fourth of sur-
face ions exactly heals polarity at its semi-inﬁnite (111)
surface. In ZB(111) thin ﬁlms, thus only ﬁnite size ef-
fects may produce a residual dipole. We indeed ﬁnd
that the diﬀerence in δVO and δVZn values between U1

6

and U3 atoms is strongly reduced compared to that in
WUR(0001) (-0.02 V and +0.17 V on oxygen and zinc
atoms, respectively, to be compared to -0.52 V and +0.67
V).

C. Band gaps

As shown in Table II, the HOMO-LUMO gaps of the
ﬁlms are systematically larger than their bulk coun-
terparts, except in the WUR(0001) ﬁlm. Several ef-
fects aﬀect the gap widths. The ﬁrst one, which has
been invoked to explain gap variations in ZnO bulk
polymorphs10,12, is a gap enlargement due to the de-
crease of surface band widths.
Indeed, surface atoms
have less second neighbors than internal atoms, leading
to a narrowing of the O2p-O2p band width at the top of
the valence band and of the Zn4s-Zn4s band width at the
bottom of the conduction band. However, this surface ef-
fect does not modify the minimal gap of the ﬁlm, which
is found in the LDOS of internal atoms. A second eﬀect
is a gap reduction due to the decrease of the electrostatic
potential on surface atoms, as discussed above. Surface
states present at the top of VB or bottom of CB induce a
gap reduction. We have previously seen that the eﬀect is
especially strong in the WUR(0001) ﬁlm but also exists,
although to a lesser extent, in WUR(1010), BCT(010),
and CUB(100) ﬁlms. However, Table II shows that, in all
cases except WUR(0001), this electrostatic-driven gap re-
duction is not dominant. The gaps in the ﬁlms are larger
than in the bulks, which requires larger gaps in the LDOS
of I atoms than in the bulks. Quantum conﬁnement, i.e.
the quantiﬁcation of states propagating perpendicular to
the ﬁlm surfaces, can induce such opening of the gap.
This eﬀect, which asymptotically decreases as the ﬁlms
become thicker, is expected to be particularly strong in
such ultra-thin ﬁlms and to prevail over the gap narrow-
ing due to electrostatic eﬀects, except when the latter is
exceptionally strong as in WUR(0001).

V. OPTICAL PROPERTIES

On the basis of the electronic structure characteristics
discussed in the preceding section, we now analyze the
optical properties of the ZnO ﬁlms, ﬁrst focusing on the
optical dielectric constant and then on the absorption
spectra.

A. Optical dielectric function

The values of the high frequency bulk dielectric con-
stant ∞, i.e.
the values of the dielectric constant in
the limit of inﬁnite phonon and zero electronic frequen-
cies, are gathered in Table IV, for the various ZnO poly-
morphs. In anisotropic bulks (WUR, BCT and h-BN),
the ordinary (OC) and extraordinary (EC) components

are given, associated to a momentum transfer parallel
and perpendicular to the ab plane, respectively.

TABLE IV: High frequency dielectric function, in the bulk
(left part of the table) and in the ﬁlms (right part), with ref-
erence to the mean electronic density n in the bulk (in ˚A−3).
OC and EC denote the ordinary and extraordinary compo-
nents, respectively. In the ﬁlms, x and y refer to directions
parallel to the surface, while z is perpendicular to it.

h-BN 3.58 3.68 1.60 (0001) 4.53 4.53 4.09

In bulk WUR, the values found are in agreement with
previous theoretical estimations at the same level of
theory54–56, and close to the experimental value of 3.757,
a typical value for a semiconductor of mixed ionic and
covalent character. Among the polymorphs, the varia-
tions of ∞ qualitatively correlate with the mean valence
electronic density n, as expected from simple models of
screening50 ∞ ≈ 1 + 4πne2/(mE2
g ).

The evaluation of the high frequency dielectric con-
stants ∞ of the ﬁlms is less straightforward. In a ﬁrst
step, the dielectric constant sc(L) of the simulated su-
percell, which includes the ﬁlm (of thickness h) and a
large vacuum thickness L, is calculated for several values
of L and shown to depend on L according to the following
law:

sc(L) =

h ∗ ∞ + L ∗ vac

L + h

(2)

in which vac = 1 is the vacuum dielectric constant. This
law, which is an extrapolation of the expression derived
in Ref. 58 for the dielectric screening in two-dimensional
insulators, assumes that the electronic polarizability of
a complex medium can be estimated from an average of
the polarizabilities of its various parts weighted by their
respective volumes. From the extrapolation at L → 0
of the linear plot of (L + h)sc(L)/h, the ﬁlm dielectric
function ∞ can be obtained. Its three components asso-
ciated to momentum transfers along x, y and z are given
in Table IV.

As a general statement, the components of the ﬁlm di-
electric functions are larger than in the bulk by c.a. 20%,
but still correlate with the mean electronic density. The
anisotropy between the x and y components is nonexis-
tent (WUR(0001), CUB(100), h-BN(0001)) or extremely
weak (WUR(10¯10), BCT(010)59, ZB(110)), while the z
component is systematically smaller than the x and y
ones. The overall anisotropy is thus larger in thin ﬁlms
than in the bulks.

and bulks. For the bulks, dashed-dotted black and dotted
red lines mark the ordinary and extraordinary spectra.
In
the ﬁlms, solid black, dotted blue and dashed red lines are
for the q (cid:107) x, q (cid:107) y, q (cid:107) z spectra, respectively. CUB(100)
and h-BN(0001) are isotropic on the xy plane, so only the
q (cid:107) x component is reported. Dotted vertical lines arbitrarily
aligned with structures of WUR(10¯10), highlight A, B, C, and
X regions of the spectra. All spectra have been convoluted
with a 0.5 eV wide Gaussian function.

B. Absorption spectra

The absorption spectra (frequency dependence of the
imaginary part of the dielectric function in the limit of
vanishing momentum transfer) of the six ZnO thin ﬁlms
are displayed in Figure 4, together with their bulk ref-

As for the high frequency dielectric constant,
the anisotropy of the ﬁlms is reﬂected in an increase of
nonequivalent contributions in the absorption spectra.

Beyond the onset region to be discussed below, the
ﬁlm absorption spectra present many similarities with
their corresponding bulks. The main absorption peaks,
labeled A, B and the shoulder C correspond to transitions
from the upper part of the VB (from 0 to ≈ 3 eV below
the VB maximum), to the lower part of the CB (from 0
to ≈ 4 eV above the CB minimum), to the S/P1 region,
and to the P2 region, respectively, with reference to the
LDOS structures (Figure 2). Transitions from the Zn
3d states have a small weight and their contributions to
this part of the spectrum is negligible. At variance, the
small X structure located around ω = 20 eV in both
OC and EC is due to transitions from these localized
Zn 3d states to the P2 region. Due to the diﬀerences in
local environments of the I, U1, U2 and U3 atoms and the
LDOS structure shifts which result, the absorption peaks
in the ﬁlms are generally broadened with respect to their
bulk counterparts.

The main diﬀerences between the bulk and ﬁlm ab-
sorption spectra occur in the vicinity of the absorption
threshold, as seen in Figure 5 which displays an enlarged
view of this spectral region. First, the threshold energy
is slightly shifted with respect to the bulk due to the gap
variations (cf Table II). In most polymorphs, this shift is
very small and hardly visible at the scale of the ﬁgure.
Only in WUR(0001) can it be well observed, due to the
larger reduction of Madelung potential on surface atoms.
Speciﬁc structures are observed in the ω range approx-
imately 0-3 eV above threshold, which involve transi-
tions between surface states/resonances in close vicinity
to the VB maximum and CB minimum. Starting from
the threshold, the ﬁrst peaks which appear are in the x
and y components of the spectra, consistently with the
mostly px and py orbital character of the surface states
at the top of the valence band. In the WUR(0001) ab-
sorption spectrum, a well-deﬁned pre-peak exists due to
a transition between the surface states at the top of the
VB and the bottom of the CB.

eﬀects play a prominent role, this energy diﬀerence ∆ in-
versely correlates with the degree of hybridization of the

IV A. It decreases in the series h-BN(0001), BCT(010),
WUR(10¯10), CUB(100), ZB(110), which is consistent
with the decrease of anisotropy of the optical dielectric
constant displayed in Table IV.

The present work, which relies on gradient-corrected
and hybrid ﬁrst principles simulations, provides a com-
plete characterization of the electronic properties of
ZnO thin-ﬁlms with four monolayer thickness, cut
along the BCT(010), CUB(100), h-BN(0001), ZB(110),
WUR(1010) and (0001) orientations.

The modiﬁcations of the local densities of states have
been described and analyzed in terms of the reduction of
the Madelung potential on under-coordinated atoms and
surface states/resonances appearing at the top of the VB
and bottom of the CB. The gap width in the ﬁlms is
found to be larger than in the corresponding bulk, which
is assigned to quantum conﬁnement eﬀects.

The components of the high frequency dielectric con-
stant have been determined. They are larger than their

9

bulk counterparts and display a larger anisotropy. Fi-
nally, the absorption spectra of the ﬁlms have been com-
puted. They display speciﬁc features in an energy range
just above threshold due to transition from or to surface
states/resonances.

This study provides a ﬁrst understanding of ﬁnite size
eﬀects on the electronic properties of ZnO thin ﬁlms.
Analysis of their thickness dependence is currently un-
der progress in our group.
