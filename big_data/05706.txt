SLOW AND FAST ESCAPE FOR OPEN INTERMITTENT MAPS

MARK F. DEMERS AND MIKE TODD

Abstract. If a system mixes too slowly, putting a hole in it can completely destroy the richness of
the dynamics. Here we study this instability for a class of intermittent maps with a family of slowly
mixing measures. We show that there are three regimes: 1) standard hyperbolic-like behavior
where the rate of mixing is faster than the rate of escape through the hole, there is a unique
limiting absolutely continuous conditionally invariant measure (accim) and there is a complete
thermodynamic description of the dynamics on the survivor set; 2) an intermediate regime, where
the rate of mixing and escape through the hole coincide, limiting accims exist, but much of the
thermodynamic picture breaks down; 3) a subexponentially mixing regime where the slow mixing
means that mass simply accumulates on the parabolic ﬁxed point. We give a complete picture of
the transitions and stability properties (in the size of the hole and as we move through the family)
in this class of open systems. In particular we are able to recover a form of stability in the third
regime above via the dynamics on the survivor set, even when no limiting accim exists.

1. Introduction and Statement of Results

Dynamical systems with holes are examples of systems in which the domain is not invariant under
the dynamics. Such systems arise in a variety of contexts: For example, in the study of non-
attracting invariant sets, as well as in non-equilibrium dynamical systems, in which mass or energy
is allowed to enter or escape.
In this latter context, a system with a hole can be viewed as a
component of a much larger system of interacting components.

To date, systems with holes have been studied almost exclusively in situations in which the rate
of mixing of the closed system (before the introduction of the hole) is exponential and therefore
the rate of escape from the system is also exponential. Such systems include expanding maps
[PY, CMS, CV, LM], Smale horseshoes [C], Anosov diﬀeomorphisms [CM, CMT], certain unimodal
maps [BDM], and dispersing billiards [DWY1, D3, D4], to name but a few.

In all these papers, the main focus is the existence and physical properties of conditionally invariant
measures, which describe the limiting distribution of mass conditioned on non-escape. Given a
dynamical system, (T, X, B), one identiﬁes a measurable set H ∈ B and studies the open system,
˚T : ˚X → X, where ˚X = X \ H. The n-step survivor sets are deﬁned by ˚X n =Tn
i=0 T −i( ˚X), which
correspond to the non-invariant domains of the iterates of the map, ˚T n = T n| ˚X n.
A measure µ on X is called conditionally invariant if

˚T∗µ(A)
˚T∗µ(X)

:=

µ( ˚X 1 ∩ T −1(A))

µ( ˚X 1)

= µ(A)

for all A ∈ B.

If we set µ( ˚X 1) = λ, the relation above can be iterated to obtain ˚T n
∗ µ(A) = λnµ(A), so that a
conditionally invariant measure necessarily predicts an exponential rate of decay of mass from the
open system. Unfortunately, under quite general conditions, uncountably many such measures exist
for any eigenvalue λ ∈ (0, 1), even if one restricts to measures absolutely continuous with respect
to a given reference measure [DY], so existence questions are meaningless.

In order to obtain a physically relevant measure, one ﬁxes a reference measure m and focuses on the
existence and properties of limiting distributions obtained by pushing forward m and conditioning
. For systems with exponential rates
on non-escape, i.e. studying limit points of the sequence
of escape, such limiting distributions are often conditionally invariant measures which describe
the limiting dynamics with respect to a large class of reference measures, and enjoy many of
the properties that equilibrium measures enjoy in closed systems. Moreover, in many cases the
eigenvalue λ associated with such measures describes the exponential rate of escape from the open
system with respect to m,

Recently, there has been interest in open systems exhibiting subexponential rates of escape [DO,
APT, DR], and in particular their relation to slowly mixing systems from non-equilibrium statistical
mechanics [Ya]. Such open systems exhibit qualitatively diﬀerent behavior from systems with expo-
nential escape rates. For example, conditionally invariant measures no longer have a physical inter-

are typically singular (with respect to m) invariant measures supported on ˚X∞ :=T∞i=0 T −i(X\H),

the set of points which never enter the hole [DF]. From the point of view of limiting distributions,
systems with subexponential rates of escape are unstable with respect to leaks in the system.

In the present paper, we introduce holes into a class of Manneville-Pomeau maps f = fγ of the
unit interval with intermittent behavior. We consider the dynamics of the open system from the
point of view of the family of geometric potentials, tφ = −t log |Df|, t ∈ [0, 1]. When t = 1, the
conformal measure with respect to φ = − log |Df| is Lebesgue measure, with respect to which
these maps have polynomial rates of mixing. As such, the open system has no physically relevant
conditionally invariant measure absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue [DF]. But for t < 1,
the maps admit conformal measures mt with respect to tφ that are exponentially mixing and so
have exponential rates of escape, where the mixing rate converges to zero as t → 1, yielding an
excellent test bed for the study of slow mixing with holes.

Fixing a hole H as described in Section 1.2, we are able to precisely characterize the dynamics of
the open system in terms of the parameter t in 3 distinct regimes: t ∈ [0, tH ), t ∈ [tH, 1), and t = 1,
where tH is the Hausdorﬀ dimension of the survivor set.

• When t ∈ [0, tH ), the escape rate (1.1) with respect to mt is slower than the rate of mixing
of the closed system, and so the transfer operator associated with the open system has
a spectral gap.
In this setting, the classical results proved for strongly hyperbolic open
systems mentioned above are recovered (Theorem 1.6).

• When t ∈ [tH , 1), the escape rate with respect to mt equals the rate of mixing of the
closed system and the associated transfer operator for the open system has no spectral gap;
, yield conditionally invariant measures,
however, averaged limit points of the form
absolutely continuous with respect to mt (Theorem 1.9).

In order to recover a form of stability for the open system when t = 1, we use an induced map
to construct an invariant measure on the survivor set. When t ∈ [0, tH ], these measures maximize
the pressure on the survivor set and satisfy an escape rate formula (see Theorem 1.6). When
t ∈ (tH, 1], these measures do not maximize the pressure on the survivor set, but they do converge
to the absolutely continuous equilibrium state for the closed system as the hole shrinks to a point
(Theorem 1.11). Thus, although the system is unstable with respect to leaks from the point of

One of the principal tools we use is a Young tower, which is a type of Markov extension for the
open system.
It is of independent interest that in order to obtain the sharp division between
the regimes listed above, we signiﬁcantly strengthen previous results on Young towers with holes.
Speciﬁcally, we prove the existence of a spectral gap for the associated transfer operator under a
weak asymptotic condition: The escape rate from the tower is strictly less than the rate of decay in
the levels of the tower. Previous results [D1, BDM, DWY1] assumed strong control on the amount
of mass lost at each step, while we are able to prove comparable results under this much weaker
and more natural condition. Our results are in some sense optimal: When the escape rate equals
the rate of decay in the levels of the tower, the essential spectral radius and spectral radius of the
associated transfer operator on the relevant function space coincide. This optimality suggests that
these results provide a new paradigm for open non-uniformly hyperbolic systems in general.

The paper is organized as follows. In the remainder of Section 1, we state our assumptions precisely,
deﬁne the relevant terminology and state our main results. In Section 2 we provide some background
and initial results on pressure, while in Section 3 we prove an essential inequality relating the escape
rate to the diﬀerence in pressures between the open and closed systems. In Sections 4, 5 and 6, we
prove our main theorems in the three regimes outlined above. Section 7 contains some examples of
large holes that do not satisfy our conditions and some analysis of the dynamics in such cases.

1.1. Class of maps. For γ ∈ (0, 1), we will study the class of Manneville-Pomeau maps deﬁned
by

f = fγ : x 7→(x(1 + 2γxγ)

2x − 1

if x ∈ [0, 1/2),
if x ∈ [1/2, 1].

Such maps exhibit intermittent behavior due to the neutral ﬁxed point 0 and have been well-studied,
most commonly from the point of view of Lebesgue measure [Y2, LSV1], which is the conformal
measure with respect to the potential φ := − log |Df|. We will be interested in the related family
of geometric potentials tφ, t ∈ [0, 1], and their associated pressures.
For a dynamical system (T, X, B) with some measurable and metric structure and a measurable
potential ψ : X → [−∞,∞], we deﬁne the pressure of this system to be

P (ψ) = PT (ψ) := sup(cid:26)hT (µ) +Z ψ dµ : µ ∈ MT and −Z ψ dµ < ∞(cid:27) .

Here, MT is the set of ergodic, T -invariant probability measures on X and hµ(T ) is the metric
entropy of µ. Note that the restriction on the integral is to deal with cases where the system has
inﬁnite entropy, so that the sum deﬁning the pressure may not make sense.

M.F. DEMERS AND M. TODD

For our class of maps and potentials, we set p(t) := P (tφ). Note that p(t) = 0 for t > 1. It is
well-known that for t 6 1 there exists a unique (tφ − p(t))-conformal measure mt (note that m1 is
Lebesgue measure). Moreover,

with respect to m1. The system is subexponentially mixing with respect to µ1.

• For γ ∈ (0, 1) and t = 1, there is an equilibrium state µ1 for φ that is absolutely continuous
• For t < 1, there exists a unique equilibrium state µt for tφ, which is exponentially mixing

and furthermore equivalent to mt.

We will study the dynamics of the related open system with respect to this family of potentials,
taking their associated conformal measures mt as our reference measures.

1.2. Introduction of holes. We next introduce a hole H into the system, which in this paper
will be a ﬁnite union of intervals. The sets ˚I n = ∩n
i=0f−i(I \ H), n > 0, denote the set of points
that have not entered H by time n. Deﬁne ˚f = f|˚I 1 to be the map with the hole and its iterates,
˚f n := f n|˚I n. The dynamics of this map deﬁne the open system.
A particularly convenient form of hole is deﬁned as follows. Let P1 be the standard renewal
partition, i.e., Z ∈ P1 implies Z is an interval for which either f (Z) ∈ P1, or Z = [1/2, 1). We then
let Pn := P1 ∨(cid:16)Wn−1
k=0 f−k{[0, 1/2), [1/2, 1)}(cid:17). We ﬁx N0 > 0 and then deﬁne a hole to be some
collection of elements of PN0: we call such a set a Markov hole.
Before formulating a condition on the hole, we introduce an induced map ˚F , deﬁned as the ﬁrst
return map to Y = [1/2, 1) \ H under ˚f . Let τ : Y → N denote the inducing time, so that either
˚F (x) = ˚f τ (x)(x) ∈ Y or ˚F (x) = ˚f τ (x)(x) ∈ H. In the absence of a hole, F : Y → Y would be a
full-branched map; however, once a hole has been introduced, ˚F is no longer full branched. Let Q
denote the coarsest partition of Y by images of ﬁrst returns of elements of PN0. Note that Q is a
ﬁnite partition of Y \ H due to our deﬁnition of PN0.
The classical deﬁnitions of transitivity via open sets no longer make sense for the open system1
(since everything except the hole would be transient), so we adopt the following combinatorial
deﬁnition in terms of the Markov partition.

We say that H is non-swallowing if:

(1) Q is transitive on elements: For each pair Q1, Q2 ∈ Q, ∃n ∈ N such that ˚f n(Q1) ∩ Q2 6= ∅;
(2) For all δ > 0, m1(˚F (1/2, 1/2 + δ)) > 0.

Otherwise, we call the hole swallowing. Deﬁne X := Y \ H = ∪Q∈QQ. Note that our deﬁnition of
non-swallowing implies that ˚F|X is transitive on elements, but not necessarily aperiodic; however,
in Lemma 4.14 we will show that ˚f is aperiodic on elements with this deﬁnition.

Condition (2) ensures that the system has repeated passes through a neighborhood of the neutral
ﬁxed point: Were this condition violated, much of the non-expansive behavior present in the closed
system would be lost or trivialized. Examples of swallowing holes and a brief description of the
dynamics in these nontransitive cases are given in Section 7. For our main results, we will assume
that our hole is non-swallowing.

1The open system can be decomposed into a disjoint union of open intervals ˚I = S∞n=1

that f (˚I n−1 \ ˚I n) = ˚I n−2 \ ˚I n−1 and f n(˚I n−1 \ ˚I n) ⊂ H.

Below we record two important facts about the open system that follow from the deﬁnition of
non-swallowing.
Lemma 1.1. Let Xi, i ∈ N, denote the maximal intervals in [1/2, 1] on which ˚F is smooth and
injective. Then there exists K1 > 0 so that |{τ = n}| 6 K1n−(1+ 1
γ ) and #{i : τ (Xi) = n} 6 CN0 for
some CN0 > 1 depending only on N0. Moreover, if H is non-swallowing then there exists K2 > 0
such that for any N ∈ N, there exists n > N with |{τ = n}| > K2n−(1+ 1

γ )

Proof. The ﬁrst fact follows immediately from standard constructions. See for example, [Y2, LSV1].
The second uses the same constructions, with the added information that there are inducing do-
mains arbitrarily close to 1/2.
(cid:3)
Lemma 1.2. If H is a non-swallowing Markov hole then the survivor set ˚I∞ := ∩∞n=0
entropy.

˚I n has positive

Proof. Let A and B be 1-cylinders for ˚F . By deﬁnition of non-swallowing, there exist nA, nB ∈ N
be such that ˚f nA(A) = ˚f nB (B) = X. Then our system contains a horseshoe with entropy at least
log 2/ max{nA, nB} > 0.
(cid:3)

Given the potential φ = − log |Df|, set φH to be the punctured potential,

φH (x) =(φ(x)

if x ∈ I \ H,

−∞ if x ∈ H.

Then let p(t) = P (tφ) and pH(t) := P (tφH ). Due to the neutral ﬁxed point, it is clear that

p(t) > pH(t) > 0, for t ∈ [0, 1]. Also, since φ is bounded, the condition −R φH dν < ∞ is equivalent

to ν(H) = 0, which implies the supremum in P (tφH ) is over invariant measures supported on the
survivor set, ˚I∞.

1.3. Transfer Operator. We will study the evolution of measures from the point of view of the
transfer operators associated with our family of potentials. Given the potential tφ, we deﬁne the
associated transfer operator acting on L1(mt) by

Ltf (x) := Ltφ−p(t)f (x) = Xy∈f−1x

f (y)etφ(y)−p(t).

When we introduce a hole, the transfer operator for the open system corresponds to the transfer
operator for the punctured potential,

˚Ltf (x) := LtφH−p(t)f (x) = Ltφ−p(t)(1˚I 1 · f )(x) = Xy∈˚f−1x

f (y)etφ(y)−p(t).

Since mt is conformal with respect to tφ − p(t), we have
t f dmt =Z˚I n

Z ˚Ln

f dmt,

so that the spectral properties of ˚Lt are tied to the rate of escape of the open system with respect
to mt.

1.4. Main results. The standing assumptions of this section are that f = fγ is a map as described
above and H is a non-swallowing hole.

One of the key quantities associated with an open system is the exponential rate of escape. We
will be primarily concerned with the rate of escape with respect to the conformal measures mt. To
this end we deﬁne,

log λt = lim sup

k

1
k

log mt(˚I k) and log λt = lim inf

k

k

log mt(˚I k),

and when these two quantities coincide we denote the common value log λt.

A fundamental relation between pressure and escape is given by the following proposition, which
we prove in Section 3.
Proposition 1.3. For any t ∈ [0, 1], we have

log λt > pH(t) − p(t).

In fact, Corollary 1.7 shows that for the class of maps we study here, the inequality above is always
an equality.

Whether the punctured pressure pH(t) is positive or zero has a strong inﬂuence on the dynamics
of the open system with respect to the reference measure mt. The following series of results
characterizes this behavior in the relevant regimes. To this end, deﬁne

tH := sup{t ∈ R : pH(t) > 0}.

By Lemma 1.2, the following result applies in all non-swallowing cases.
Lemma 1.4. If ˚I∞ has positive entropy, then tH ∈ (0, 1] and pH(tH ) = 0.
Proof. First note that t 7→ pH(t) is a continuous function of t since φ is bounded. We have
pH(t) 6 p(t) = 0 for all t > 1, and indeed pH(1) = 0 as well, since for example hδ0(f ) +R φ dδ0 = 0
where δ0 denotes the point mass at 0. Also, pH(0) > 0 since the entropy on ˚I∞ is assumed to be
positive. Thus, by the continuity of pH(t), tH is ﬁnite and is contained in (0, 1].
(cid:3)

Note that techniques described later in this paper further show that tH < 1 for any non-trivial
hole.

Our next proposition establishes tH as the Hausdorﬀ dimension of the survivor set and describes
the behavior of the pressure function on both sides of tH. As in [IT2], we say that a potential
φ is recurrent if there exists a ﬁnite conservative (φ − P (φ))-conformal measure; and transient
otherwise. Recurrence can also be related to induced potentials. The potential for the induced
map F corresponding to φ is

As described in Section 2.1 below, φ is recurrent if and only if P (Φ − P (φ)τ ) = 0.

(d) If t > tH, then pH(t) = 0 and we have P (tΦH − pH(t)τ ) < 0. Hence tφH is transient.
(e) If t < tH, then pH(t) > 0 and P (tΦH − pH(t)τ ) = 0. Hence tφH is recurrent.
(f) DpH(tH) = 0 if tH ∈ (γ/(1 + γ), 2γ/(1 + γ)]. Otherwise2 D−pH(tH ) < 0

Proposition 1.5 suggests that t = tH is a dividing line between qualitatively diﬀerent behaviors
of the dynamics with respect to the conformal measures mt. The following theorem demonstrates
that the dynamics is strongly hyperbolic in the regime t ∈ [0, tH ). The proof of the theorem uses
the induced map F : Y (cid:9) to construct an extension of the open system, known as a Young tower,
which we denote by ∆. Young towers are deﬁned precisely in Section 4.1.
Theorem 1.6. (The case t ∈ [0, tH ): uniformly hyperbolic behavior.) Fix q > 0 which will deter-
mine the class of C q functions that we will lift to ∆.

If − log λt < p(t), then the following hold.

(1) λt < 1 exists and is the spectral radius of the punctured transfer operator on the tower. The
associated eigenvector projects to a nonnegative function gt, which is bounded away from
zero on I \ H and satisﬁes ˚Ltgt = λtgt.

(2) pH(t) = log λt + p(t) > 0.
(3) There is a unique (tφH − pH(t))-conformal measure mH
mt and supported on ˚I∞.

t is the invariant density deﬁning the equilibrium
state µt for the closed system with potential tφ − p(t); this also implies that the escape rates with
respect to both mt and µt are the same.
The following variational principle relating the escape rate to the pressure for t ∈ [0, 1] is a sim-
ple consequence of Proposition 1.3 and Theorem 1.6. Notice that it also justiﬁes identifying the
condition − log λt < p(t) with the condition t ∈ [0, tH ) in the statement of Theorem 1.6.
Corollary 1.7. For all t ∈ [0, 1],

− log λt < p(t) if and only if pH(t) > 0 if and only if t < tH.

Moreover, for all t ∈ [0, 1], λt exists and log λt = pH(t) − p(t).
Our next result shows that in the regime t ∈ [0, tH ), the conditionally invariant measures µH
construct vary continuously as the hole shrinks to a point.

Next we turn our attention to invariant measures on the survivor set. By Theorem 1.6, we have νt,
an equilibrium measure for tφH − pH(t) for t < tH that is supported on ˚I∞. Our next result shows
that in fact, one can construct physically meaningful invariant measures on ˚I∞ even for t > tH,
including for t = 1, which are not simply the point mass at the neutral ﬁxed point and indeed
contain no atoms. For t > tH, these measures do not maximize pressure on the survivor set (in
this regime the point mass at 0 does this), but they do converge to the equilibrium measure for the
unpunctured potential tφ − p(t) as the hole shrinks to a point.
In order to obtain suﬃcient expansion for our map, we will consider the induced map ˚F and
work with ˚F 2 rather than ˚F . The induced hole for F is deﬁned by ˜H = H if H ⊂ [1/2, 1]
and ˜H = F −1(H) if H ⊂ [0, 1/2]. Since we will be working with ˚F 2, the hole will eﬀectively
be ˜H ∪ F −1( ˜H), which always has countably many connected components in Y = [1/2, 1]. Let
Yn ⊂ Y be such that f (Yn) = Jn, i.e. these are 1-cylinders for F before the introduction of the
hole. Set Yi,j = Yi ∩ F −1(Yj) and note that this is the maximal partition on which the return time
τ 2 = τ + τ ◦ F is constant.
Fix z ∈ (0, 1] and let (Hε)ε∈[0,ε0] be a nested family of intervals (not necessarily elements of a Markov
partition) containing z and such that Hε has length ε. Let ˚Fε denote the map corresponding to Hε
i=0F −i(Y \ ˜Hε). Let {Zk,ε}k∈N denote the countable collection of maximal intervals
and let ˚Y n
on which ˚F 2
ε is smooth. Note that each interval Zk,ε is contained in some Yi,j. We shall need the
following condition on the family (Hε)ε6ε0.

Remark 1.10. If one is interested only in the case t = 1, then one can work with F rather than
F 2 and condition (H) can be stated in terms of ˚Fε(Yn).

For t ∈ [0, 1], recalling the deﬁnition of induced potential in (1.2), let Pt,ε = P (tΦ − τ pHε(t)). In
Lemma 6.1 we will prove that there exists a (tΦ − τ pH(t) − Pt,ε)-conformal measure ˜mt,H for F on
Y , which has no atoms.

Theorem 1.11. Let (Hε)ε6ε0 be a nested family of intervals (not necessarily elements of a Markov
partition) satisfying (H).
If ε0 is suﬃciently small, for t ∈ [0, 1], ˚Fε admits a physical conditionally invariant measure µY,ε,
absolutely continuous with respect to ˜mt,H , with eigenvalue Λt,ε. The limit

exists for each ψ ∈ C 0(Y ) and deﬁnes an ergodic invariant probability measure νY,ε supported on
the survivor set ˚Y ∞ε = ˚I∞ε ∩ Y . Moreover,

log Λt,ε = P (tΦHε − τ pHε(t)) − P (tΦ − τ pHε(t))

and νY,ε is an equilibrium measure for the potential tΦHε − τ pHε(t) − P (tΦHε − τ pHε(t)).
The measure νY,ε projects to a probability measure νHε with the following properties:

(1) νHε is an invariant measure for f supported on the survivor set ˚I∞ε ;
(2) νHε is an equilibrium state for tφHε − pHε(t) − P (tΦHε − τ pHε(t)) · 1Y ; so if t 6 tHε then
νHε is an equilibrium state for tφHε − pHε(t), i.e. it coincides with the measure νt from
Theorem 1.6;
(3) for ﬁxed t, the free energy hνHε (f ) +R tφHε dνHε is continuous in ε for ε > 0 close enough
(4) for ﬁxed ε, the free energy of νHε = νHε,t is analytic for t ∈ (tH, 1) and continuous on the
(5) νHε converges weakly (when integrated against both continuous functions and functions of

closure, [tHε, 1];

to 0;

bounded variation) to the equilibrium measure µt for the closed system as ε → 0.

Remark 1.12. Note that νHε is not a measure which maximizes the pressure hν(f ) + tR φHε dν

on ˚I∞ε when t > tHε. One has

0 = hδ0 (f ) + tZ φHε dδ0,

where δ0 denotes the point mass at 0. On the other hand, for the induced system, for any t 6 1,
we have for the original map f ,

hνHε (f ) + tZ φHε dνHε =

+ pHε(t)

P (tΦHε − τ pHε(t))
=(cid:0)P (tΦHε − τ pHε(t))(cid:1) νε(Y ) + pHε(t),

where the ﬁnal equality follows from Kac’s formula. Using Proposition 1.5, when t > tHε then
pHε(t) = 0 and P (tΦHε) < 0 so the right hand side of (1.4) is negative.
Conversely, when t < tHε then pHε(t) > 0 and P (tΦHε − τ pHε(t)) = 0, so the right hand side of
(1.4) is positive and νHε is indeed an equilibrium state for tφHε − pHε(t) as stated in Theorem 1.11.

(1.4)

10

M.F. DEMERS AND M. TODD

When t = tHε, pHε(tHε) = P (tHεΦHε) = 0 as in Proposition 1.5(a), so the right hand side of (1.4)
is 0 and again νHε is an equilibrium state for tφHε − pHε(t).
Note that t = 1 is the only value of t ∈ [0, 1] which is not eventually less than tH as H shrinks to
a point. Despite this, the sequence of measures νHε constructed in Theorem 1.11 converges to the
SRB measure µ1 for the closed system as ε → 0. From the point of view of the invariant measure
on ˚I∞, then, this theorem recovers a form of stability of the SRB measure for the system in the
presence of small leaks. This is in contrast to the instability of the SRB measure from the point of
view of limiting distributions in the open system, since ˚f n

∗ m1/|˚f n

∗ m1| → δ0 as n → ∞ [DF].

2. Basic pressure results

In this section we will start by recalling thermodynamic formalism for symbolic systems, and then
push this onto our system, proving Proposition 1.5.

2.1. Thermodynamic formalism in symbolic spaces. Let (Σ, σ) be a one-sided Markov shift
over the countable alphabet N. This means that there exists a matrix (tij)N×N of zeros and ones
(with no row and no column made entirely of zeros) such that

Σ :=(cid:8)(xn)n∈N : txixi+1 = 1 for every i ∈ N(cid:9) .

The shift map σ : Σ → Σ is deﬁned by σ(x1x2x2 . . . ) = (x2x2 . . . ). We will always assume the
system (Σ, σ) to be topologically transitive (but not necessarily mixing), which means that for any
two elements a, b ∈ N, there is a sequence (xn)n∈N ∈ Σ with x0 = a and xn = b for some n ∈ N.
Note that the theory usually assumes the stronger condition of topological mixing (see [S1] for a
precise deﬁnition), but in [BS] this was shown to be unnecessary. The space Σ endowed with the
topology generated by the cylinder sets

Ci1i2...in := {(xn)n∈N ∈ Σ : xi = ij for j ∈ {1, 2, 3 . . . n}} ,

is a non-compact space. We deﬁne the nth variation of a function φ : Σ → R by

varn(φ) =

sup

(i1...in)∈Nn

sup

x,y∈Ci1i2...in |φ(x) − φ(y)|.

A function φ : Σ → R is locally H¨older if there exists 0 < γ < 1 and C > 0 such that for every
n ∈ N we have varn(φ) ≤ Cγn.
Given a potential φ : Σ → R, let Snφ(x) := Pn−1
k=0 φ(σkx), be the n-th ergodic sum. A measure µ
on Σ is called a Gibbs measure for φ if there exist K > 1 and P ∈ R such that, given the n-cylinder
Ci1i2...in, for each x ∈ Ci1i2...in,

1
K
Here P is called the Gibbs constant of µ.

6 K.

The Gurevich Pressure of a locally H¨older potential φ : ∪nXn → R was introduced by Sarig in [S1],
generalizing Gurevich’s deﬁnition of entropy. It is deﬁned by letting

where 1Xi(x) denotes the characteristic function of the cylinder Xi, and the Gurevich pressure is

Zn(φ) = Xσnx=x

n→∞

where the limit exists by almost superadditivity ([S1, Theorem 1]). The limit always exists and its
value does not depend on the cylinder Xi considered. This notion of pressure satisﬁes the following
variational principle: if φ is a locally H¨older potential then by [S1, Theorem 3],

PG(φ) = P (φ).

Hence we can write P in place of PG. A measure attaining the supremum above will be called an
equilibrium measure for φ.

The potential φ is called recurrent if

Zn(φ)e−nPG(φ) = ∞,

Xn

and otherwise it is called transient. Note that due to [S2, Theorem 1], in this setting this deﬁnition
of transience is equivalent to that given in the previous section. Deﬁning Z∗n(φ) similarly to Zn(φ),
but only summing over those periodic points which make their ﬁrst return to Xi at time n, we say
that a recurrent potential φ is positive recurrent if

and otherwise φ is null recurrent. Again this deﬁnition is independent of Xi, and indeed a k-cylinder
yields the same result.

nZ∗n(φ)e−nPG(φ) < ∞,

Xn

It is easy to see from the deﬁnition of PG that the pressure function is convex, when ﬁnite (one can
also easily prove this from the basic deﬁnition of pressure P ). Hence we have the following lemma.

Lemma 2.1. Suppose that φ : Σ → R is locally H¨older and t1 < t2 are such that PG(tφ) < ∞ for
t ∈ (t1, t2). Then t 7→ PG(tφ) is continuous on (t1, t2).

We say that (Σ, σ) has the big images and preimages (BIP) property if

∃b1, . . . , bN ∈ N such that ∀ a ∈ N, ∃i, j such that tbiatabj = 1.
A simple example of such a system is the full shift on N. As in [S3], we can set

i.e., we needn’t restrict ourselves to Xi, and it can be shown that

˜Zn(φ) = Xσnx=x

eSnφ(x),

log( ˜Zn(φ))

.

n

P (φ) = lim
n→∞
Moreover, P (φ) < ∞ if and only if ˜Z1(φ)) < ∞.
Theorem 2.2 ([S3]). PG(φ) < ∞ if and only if there is an invariant Gibbs measure µ for φ with
Gibbs constant PG(φ). Moreover, if h(µ) < ∞ (equivalently R φ > −∞) then µ is an equilibrium
state for φ.
Let Cn be a cylinder and ¯σ : Cn → Cn the ﬁrst return map to Cn with return time rCn. (Cn, ¯σ) is
known as the induced system on Cn. Given a potential ψ : Σ → R, let Ψ : Cn → Cn be deﬁned by
Ψ(x) := SrCn ψ(x) =PrCn−1

Given a σ-invariant measure µ, giving positive mass to Cn, we call ¯µ = µ|Cn
µ(Cn) the lift of µ. By
Kac’s Lemma, this is ¯σ-invariant. Conversely, given a ¯σ-invariant measure ¯ν, if ν lifts to ¯ν, then ν

k=0 ψ(σkx).

12

is called the projection of ¯ν. Abramov’s formula gives

h(¯ν) =(cid:18)Z rCn d¯ν(cid:19) h(ν) and Z Ψ d¯ν =(cid:18)Z rCn d¯ν(cid:19)(cid:18)Z ψ dν(cid:19) .

We note that these results also pass to induced maps which are not ﬁrst return maps.

Given a metric on Σ, a potential ψ : Σ → R is called a metric potential if there exists K > 1 such
that

The following is [I, Theorem 3.1], adapted slightly. The proof uses inducing to some domain to
produce a BIP system, so we change the statement to include this explicitly rather than talking
about recurrent points as in [I].

Theorem 2.3. If (Σ, σ) has the BIP property and is topologically transitive and ψ is a metric
potential, then

dimH(Σ) = t∗ := inf{t : PG(−t log ψ) 6 0}.

2.2. Preliminary results on pressure for our systems. For A contained in some interval,
we say that the map T : A → A is Markov if there exists a countable Markov shift (Σ, σ) and
a continuous bijective map π : Σ → A such that T ◦ π = π ◦ σ. We will use the notation
[i1, . . . , in] := π(Ci1...in). We will also lift potentials φ : A → R to their symbolic version φ◦ π which
we will require to be locally H¨older.
Now we return to our open system (˚f , ˚I, H). Recall that X = ∪Q∈QQ and let ˚X∞ denote the set
of points which map inﬁnitely often into X under ˚F . In the following, we will use the fact that the
natural symbolic coding of the system ˚F : ˚X∞ → ˚X∞ satisﬁes the BIP property and is transitive,
although it may be not mixing. This means that all the results in Section 2.1 pass to our system:
here our potential Φ lifts to a metric potential on the symbolic model (that is, compatible with the
Euclidean metric on [0, 1)), thus also inducing a compatible metric.

The next two lemmas follow immediately from the structure of our system.

Lemma 2.4. Suppose that H is a non-swallowing Markov hole. Then

consists of at most the countable set of preimages of 0.

˚I∞ \(cid:16)∪k>0f−k( ˚X∞)(cid:17)

Lemma 2.5. In the non-swallowing case there exists a sequence of parabolic cycles with Lyapunov
exponent tending to zero.

Proof of Lemma 2.5. Our deﬁnition of non-swallowing means that for large enough n we can ﬁnd
an inducing domain Y ′ ⊂ X with inducing time n such that ˚F (Y ′) ⊃ Y ′. Since the Lyapunov
exponent3 of the ﬁxed point of F in this domain, which is an n-periodic point for f , is, up to a
distortion constant 1
(cid:3)

n log n, the lemma follows.

|Y ′| ∼ 1

While we already knew that pH(t) > 0 for all t ∈ R due to the free energy of the Dirac measure at
0 being zero, the above lemma shows that there is a sequence of measures (µn)n on I∞ (each a sum
of Dirac masses on a periodic orbit) which give some mass to Y such that h(µn) + tR φ dµn → 0
as n → ∞. This will be important when computing the pressure on Markov structures which do
not see the ﬁxed point at 0, but do see Y . We close this section with the proof of our ﬁrst main
result, Proposition 1.5.

Proof of Proposition 1.5. The fact that pH(tH) = 0 is part of Lemma 1.4. The following claim then
completes the proof of (a).

Claim. P (tHΦH) = 0

Proof. The fact that P (tH ΦH) 6 0 follows as in [IT1, Lemma 4.1]. Moreover, the same arguments,
coupled with the existence, given by Lemma 2.5, of a sequence of measures (µn)n each of which lifts

to our inducing scheme, and such that h(µn) + tR φ dµn → 0 as n → ∞, mean that t < tH implies
that P (tΦH) > 0. So by the continuity of t 7→ P (tΦH), when ﬁnite (Lemma 2.1), to complete the
proof of the claim, we need to show that there is t < tH such that P (tΦH) < ∞.
As described in Section 2.1, P (tH ΦH) 6 0 implies that ˜Z1(tH Φ) < ∞, which means thatPi |Xi|tH
<
∞. Since by Lemma 1.1, the diameter of each of the domains in this sum is polynomially small in the
inducing time, and the number of domains with the same inducing time is uniformly bounded, this
also implies that there exists t < tH such that ˜Z1(tΦ) < ∞. Hence P (tΦH) < ∞, as required. (cid:3)

By Theorem 2.3, dimH( ˚X∞) = tH. By Lemma 2.4, dimH (˚I∞) = dimH( ˚X∞) = tH, proving (b).

1+γ , since the number of domains
< ∞ so (c)

For (c), by Lemma 1.1, we have Pi |Xi|t < ∞ if and only if t > γ
with the same inducing time is uniformly bounded by CN0. As in the claim, Pi |Xi|tH
follows immediately.
We next prove (d). Lemma 2.5 implies that pH(t) > 0 for all t ∈ R. The claim implies pH(tH ) = 0,
so since pH is decreasing, pH(t) = 0 for all t > tH. Hence P (tΦH − τ pH(t)) = P (tΦH ) for t > tH,
so the ﬁnal part of (d) follows since t 7→ P (tΦH) is strictly decreasing.
For (e), by deﬁnition pH(t) > 0. Again as in [IT1, Lemma 4.1], P (tΦH − pH(t)τ ) 6 0. By the
continuity of pressure, in domains where it is ﬁnite (Lemma 2.1) we only need show that for any
small δ > 0, 0 < P (tΦH − (pH(t) − δ)τ ) < ∞. However, from the variational deﬁnition of pressure,
there must exist an ergodic invariant measure with positive entropy µ such that

h(µ) +Z tφH dµ > pH(t) − δ.

This measure must lift to a measure µF on (Y, F ). By the Abramov formula,

h(µF ) +Z tΦH − (pH(t) − δ)τ dµF =(cid:18)Z τ dµF(cid:19)(cid:18)h(µ) +Z tφH − (pH (t) − δ) dµ(cid:19) > 0.

Hence the variational principle implies P (tΦH − (pH(t) − δ)τ ) > 0. The fact that this pressure
is also ﬁnite when δ > 0 is small follows from the fact that if δ < pH(t), then clearly ˜Z1(tΦH −
(pH(t) − δ)τ ) < ∞ since |{τ = n}| is subexponential and the number of domains with τ = n is
uniformly bounded by Lemma 1.1.

(f) is a standard consequence of the null-recurrence of tHφ, see for example [IT1, Section 8–9]. (cid:3)

3. Proof of Proposition 1.3

The proof relies on a volume lemma argument (c.f. [Y1, DWY1]) applied to the conformal measures
mt. However, in order to obtain the volume estimates we need, we shall rely on the following cylinder
structure, which is coarser than Pn.
Let D := {[0, 1/2), [1/2, 1)} and let Dn := Wn−1
k=0 f−kD. Now for x ∈ [0, 1), let Dn(x) denote the
element of Dn containing x. The next lemma follows from ‘tempered distortion’, see [JR] for a
proof.
Lemma 3.1. There exists a sequence (Vn)n ⊂ (0,∞) where Vn → 0 as n → ∞ such that for any
D ∈ Dn and any x, y ∈ D, | log Df n(x) − log Df n(y)| 6 nVn.
Using this lemma in conjunction with the Mean Value Theorem, we will estimate the mt-measure
of elements of Dn.
Recalling that H is a union of elements of PN0, let ˆN0 be such that H is a union of elements of
D ˆN0
Suppose ν is an ergodic invariant probability measure for ˚f supported on ˚I∞ such that ν(∂D1) = 0.
This assumption excludes ν = δ0 and ν = δ1, the point masses at 0 and 1, respectively. Since D1
is a generating partition for f , the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem yields,

.

for ν-a.e. x.

lim

n→∞−

n

log ν(Dn(x)) = hν (f )

By Lemma 3.1, conformality and the fact that f n(Dn(x)) = [0, 1), we have

mt(Dn(x)) > mt(f n(Dn(x)))etSn φ(x)−n(p(t)+Vn) = etSnφ(x)−n(p(t)+Vn).

(3.1)

Now for ε > 0, deﬁne

Gε,n :=(cid:26)x ∈ ˚I∞ :

1
n

Sntφ(x) > tZ φ dν − ε and ν(Dn(x)) 6 e−n(hν−ε)(cid:27) .

By the ergodic theorem and the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem, for σ > 0 we may choose n
so large that ν(Gε,n) > 1 − σ for all n suﬃciently large.
By choice of H, for n > ˆN0 and D ∈ Dn, if ˚I∞ ∩ D 6= 0, then D ⊂ ˚I n− ˆN0−1. Let Kn = {D ∈
Dn : D ∩ Gε,n 6= ∅}. Note that by construction we must have ν(∪D∈KnD) > 1 − σ for suﬃciently
large n. Thus by deﬁnition of Gε,n, the cardinality of Kn must be at least (1 − σ)en(hν−ε). These
considerations together with (3.1) yield,

mt(˚I n− ˆN0−1) > XD∈Kn

mt(D) > XD∈Kn

en(R tφdν−p(t)−ε) > (1 − σ)en(hν +t R φdν−p(t)−2ε).

Now taking logs and dividing by n yields, log λt > hν + tR φdν − p(t) − 2ε, and since this is true
for each ε > 0, we conclude log λt > hν + tR φdν − p(t).
We treat the case ν = δ0 separately. In this case Pδ0 (tφH) = 0, so the required inequality will hold
if log λt > −p(t). This is immediate since ˚I n ⊃ [0, an) for n suﬃciently large. Thus

mt(˚I n) > mt([0, an)) > CXi>n

|Ji|te−ip(t) > C′nt/γe−np(t),

SLOW AND FAST ESCAPE FOR OPEN INTERMITTENT MAPS

15

and log λt > −p(t) follows.
The only other ergodic invariant measure which gives positive mass to ∂D1 is δ1, the point mass at
1. Clearly Pδ1(tφH ) = −t log 2 and so by our previous work,

log λt > −p(t) > −t log 2 − p(t) = Pδ1(tφH) − p(t).

We have shown that

log λt > supnhν (f ) + tZ φH dν : ν is f -invariant and ergodic and ν(H) = 0o − p(t),

which is precisely what is required for the proposition.

4. Proofs of Theorems 1.6 and 1.8 and Corollary 1.7

In this section we prove results in the uniformly hyperbolic regime: for t ∈ [0, tH ), the exponential
tail decays faster than the rate of escape.

We will prove Theorem 1.6 by using the induced map F : Y (cid:9), and an associated object known as
a Young tower. We begin by recalling some basics about Young towers.

4.1. Deﬁning the Young Tower. Given the inducing scheme with a hole, (Y, F, τ, H), we deﬁne
the corresponding Young tower as follows. Recall the ﬁnite partition Q of images in Y on which
˚F is transitive on elements deﬁned in Section 1.2. Deﬁne ∆0 = X and denote by ∆0,i, the ﬁnitely
many elements of Q comprising X. Let

∆ = {(x, n) ∈ ∆0 × N | n < τ (x)}.

∆ is viewed schematically as a tower with ∆ℓ = ∆|n=ℓ as the ℓth level of the tower. The tower
map, f∆, is deﬁned by f∆(x, ℓ) = (x, ℓ + 1) if ℓ + 1 < τ (x) and either f τ (x) ∈ H, in which case
we deﬁne a hole Hτ,j ⊂ ∆τ , or f τ (x) ∈ ∆0, in which case f∆(x, τ (x) − 1) = (f τ (x), 0) = (F (x), 0).
There is a canonical projection π : ∆ → I satisfying π ◦ f∆ = f ◦ π. ∆0 is identiﬁed with ∪Q∈Q′Q
so that π|∆0 = Id.
Let {Xi} denote the maximal partition of ∆0 = X into intervals such that τY is constant on each Xi.
The partition {Xi} then induces a countable Markov partition {∆ℓ,j} on ∆ via the identiﬁcation
∆ℓ,j = f ℓ
∆(Xj ), for 0 < ℓ < τ (Xj ). On level ℓ = 0, we insist on keeping the partition ﬁnite and use
∆0,i as our partition elements. Since f is expanding, the partition {Xi}, and hence the partition
{∆ℓ,j}, is generating.
Note that since H is a 1-cylinder in PN0, by deﬁnition of {Xi}, ˜H := π−1H is the union of countably
many partition elements ∆ℓ,j. We set ˚∆ = ∆\ ˜H and refer to the corresponding partition elements
as ˚∆ℓ,j. Similarly, we deﬁne ˚∆n =Tn
Given a potential ϕ and a ϕ-conformal reference measure m on I, we deﬁne a reference measure
for ℓ > 1. For x ∈ ∆ℓ, let x− := f−ℓx
m on ∆ by m = m on ∆0 and m|∆ℓ = (f∆)∗m|∆ℓ−1∩f−1
denote the pullback of x to ∆0. We deﬁne the induced potential on ∆ by

∆|˚∆n, n ∈ N.

With these deﬁnitions, the measure m is ϕ∆-conformal.

Lemma 4.1. For t ∈ [0, 1), let mt be the measure on ˚∆ induced by mt, the conformal measure

Indeed, the following lemma shows that the escape rates from I and from ∆ are the same.

Lemma 4.2. Let mt be the measure on ∆ induced by mt as in Lemma 4.1. Then for each t ∈ [0, 1],

log λt = lim sup

log mt(˚I n) = lim sup

Proof. When t = 1, p(t) = 0 and the above quantities are all 0, so equality is trivial. Now assume
t < 1.
Recall the ﬁnite partition Q of [1/2, 1] \ H deﬁned in Section 1.2 on which ˚F is transitive on
elements. It follows from the deﬁnition of non-swallowing that ˚I ⊂ ∪i>0f i(∪Q∈QQ) = π(˚∆) up to
a countable collection of points comprising the pre-images of 0. Thus

log λt = lim sup

Due to the transitivity and ﬁnitely many elements of Q, we may choose a collection of indices,
K := {(ℓ, j)} with ℓ 6 L for some L > 0 such that π(∪(ℓ,j)∈K∆ℓ,j) = π(˚∆) and π(∆ℓ,j)∩π(∆ℓ′,j′) = ∅
for all pairs (ℓ, j) 6= (ℓ′, j′) in K. Further, we may choose K so that all elements of the base, ∆0,i,
belong to K.

Now let Pπ,t be the projection deﬁned by (4.2) with respect to the measures mt and mt. Denote by
Jtπ the relevant Jacobian. On each ∆ℓ,j for (ℓ, j) ∈ K, deﬁne ˜ψ(x) = Jtπ(x). Set ˜ψ ≡ 0 elsewhere
on ˚∆. Then by construction of K, Pπ,t ˜ψ = 1π(˚∆).
Note that by conformality, for x ∈ ∆ℓ, Jtπ(x) = e−tSℓφ(x)+ℓp(t). Thus there exists M > 0, depending
on L, such that 1 6 ˜ψ 6 M on ∆. Also, Jtπ = 1 on ∆0 so that ˜ψ = 1 on ˚∆0.

4.2. Abstract Results for Young Towers with Holes. In this section, we prove results about
an abstract Young tower with holes which may be of independent interest: We prove the transfer
operator on the tower has a spectral gap in a space of Holder continuous functions under the
assumption that the escape rate is slower than the decay rate in the levels of the tower. After
stating our assumptions formally below, we will describe how the present results generalize the
existing results of [BDM] and related references.

We assume that we have a tower map f∆ : ∆ (cid:9) with a countable generating Markov partition
{∆ℓ,j} and such that the return map to the base has ﬁnitely many images, denoted by ∆0,i. We
further assume that our reference measure m is conformal with respect to a potential ϕ∆.

In this context, we assume the following properties of the tower map.

(P1) (Exponential tail.) There exist constants C, α > 0 such that m(∆n) 6 Ce−αn, for n ∈ N.
We deﬁne a natural metric adapted to the dynamics as follows. Let τ n(x) be the time of the nth
return of x to ∆0. Deﬁne the separation time on ∆ to be

s(x, y) = min{n ≥ 0 : f τ n

∆ (x), f τ n

∆ (y) lie in diﬀerent partition elements ∆0,i}.

s(x, y) is ﬁnite m-almost everywhere since {∆ℓ,j} is a generating partition for f τ . Choose4 δ > 0
and deﬁne a metric dδ on ∆ by dδ(x, y) = e−δs(x,y).

We introduce a hole H in ∆ which is the union of countably many partition elements ∆ℓ,j, i.e.
H = ∪ℓ,kHℓ,k where Hℓ,k = ∆ℓ,j for some j. Set Hℓ = ∪jHℓ,j ⊂ ∆ℓ. For simplicity we assume
that the base ∆0 contains no holes (this can always be arranged in the construction of the tower

4In this abstract setting, the choice of δ > 0 is constrained only by (P3); however, in applications, δ will be
constrained by the expansion and regularity of the underlying map f . We will introduce this restriction on δ when
we apply this abstract framework to our map with neutral ﬁxed point in Section 4.3.

by choosing a suitable reference set X). We assume that ˚f∆ is transitive and aperiodic on the
elements {∆0,i} after the introduction of the hole.
(P2) (Slow escape.) Deﬁne log λ = lim supn→∞
(P3) (Bounded distortion.) We suppose that eϕ∆ is Lipschitz in the metric dδ. Furthermore, we

A spectral gap for tower maps with holes was established in [BDM] (see also [D1, D2, DWY1,
DWY2] for applications) under stronger conditions than those listed here.

Remark 4.3. There are two signiﬁcant diﬀerences between our assumptions and those in [BDM].
(1) The metric dδ in [BDM] uses a stronger notion of separation time which requires the derivative
of the underlying map f to grow exponentially at return times; since our maps have only polynomial
growth in the derivative, we adopt a weaker metric which requires signiﬁcant changes to our function
space arguments; in particular, see the proofs of Lemmas 4.5 and 4.10. (2) The assumption in
[BDM] on the size of the hole is comparatively strict, allowing one to control the maximum amount
of mass lost in a single iterate of the map; by contrast, our assumption (P2) only assumes that the
tail decay is faster than the escape rate asymptotically, which again requires signiﬁcant revisions to
the proof of the spectral gap.

Choose β satisfying − log λ < β < α. We deﬁne the standard weighted L∞-norm on the space of
functions on ∆, given by

We proceed to prove the quasi-compactness for the punctured transfer operator ˚L∆ := ˚LϕH

Next we prove that the essential spectral radius is strictly smaller than λβ. This bound, together
with the preceding lemma, will imply that ˚L∆ is quasi-compact as an operator on B.

Since the unit ball of B is compactly embedded in L1(m), it follows from the by-now classical
results [HH] together with Lemma 4.5 that ˚L∆ is quasi-compact as an operator on B: Its essential
spectral radius is bounded by σ < λ, and for any σ′ > σ, its spectrum outside the disk of radius
σ′ comprises only ﬁnitely many eigenvalues each of ﬁnite multiplicity. It follows from Lemma 4.4,
that the spectral radius of ˚L∆ is at least λ > σ so that the peripheral spectrum is nonempty and
lies outside the disk of radius σ.

SLOW AND FAST ESCAPE FOR OPEN INTERMITTENT MAPS

Our next step in the proof is showing that ˚L∆ has a real eigenvalue greater than σ and a corre-
sponding eigenvector which is strictly positive. Once this is done, we will use it to prove that ˚L∆
has a spectral gap.

Lemma 4.6. There exists M0 > 0 such that k
rate − log λβ with respect to 1βm exists and λβ = λβ = λβ is the spectral radius of ˚L∆ on B.

Proof. Let ρ, |ρ| > σ, be an eigenvalue of maximum modulus of ˚L∆. Since the peripheral spectrum
of ˚L∆ is ﬁnite dimensional, we may choose ρ such that ρ has maximum defect for eigenvalues
on the circle of radius |ρ|. Thus there exists d > 1 and gi ∈ B, gi 6= 0, i = 1, . . . , d, such that
( ˚L∆ − ρI)gi = gi−1 for i > 1 and ( ˚L∆ − ρI)g1 = 0, and d is the maximal such index for eigenvalues
with modulus |ρ|. Thus for n > d, we have

Integrating over ˚∆, we use the above identity to obtain the following lower bound,

Since the ﬁrst term is a polynomial of degree d− 1 while the second term has degree at most d− 2,
there exists C1 > 0 and N > 0 such that for n > N ,

Thus for n > N ,

this together with (4.12) for n > N . The bound for n < N is obtained by taking the maximum

B and m(˚∆n) > 0 for each n.
Now (4.12) implies λβ > |ρ|, while Lemma 4.4 implies λβ 6 |ρ|. Thus λβ exists and is the spectral
radius of ˚L∆.

(4.12)

(cid:3)

From now on, we use the notation λβ rather than λβ since we know the escape rate with respect

The ﬁrst fraction converges to ψ∗ by choice of the subsequence (ni)i. By the proof of Lemma 4.6,
the numerator of the second fraction has k · kB-norm bounded above by Cnd−1

the denominator is bounded below by C′nd
i , thus the second fraction converges to 0 in B (and also
in L1(m)) as i → ∞. This proves that ˚L∆ψ∗ = λβψ∗, so that λβ is in the spectrum of ˚L∆.
Note that ψ∗ > 0 and R ψ∗ dm = 1, so that necessarily λβ < 1. This is because

Lemma 4.7. Let ψn be deﬁned by (4.13). There exists M > 0 such that ψn|∆0 ∈ Blog(M ) for all

Since kψn|∆0klog 6 M for all n > 1, we have kψ∗|∆0klog 6 M , and so for each i, either ψ∗ > 0 on ∆0,i
or ψ∗ ≡ 0 on ∆0,i. Since for x ∈ ˚∆ℓ by conditional invariance, ψ∗(x) = λ−ℓ
∆ (x),
the second alternative implies ψ∗ ≡ 0 on the entire column above ∆0,i. Again using conditional
invariance, this implies that ψ∗ ≡ 0 on every ∆0,j that eventually maps to ∆0,i. By transitivity,
this is the entire base ∆0 and so ψ∗ ≡ 0 on ˚∆, which is impossible since R ψ∗dm = 1. Thus there
exists δ0 > 0 such that ψ∗ > δ0 on ∆0, and again using conditional invariance, we conclude that
ψ∗ > δ0 on all of ˚∆.

Proposition 4.9. ˚L∆ has a spectral gap, i.e. λβ is simple and all other eigenvalues have modulus
strictly less than λβ.

M.F. DEMERS AND M. TODD

Proof. We remark that the stronger assumptions used in [BDM] (see Remark 4.3) allow one to
show that ˚N∆(Blog(M )) ⊂ Blog(M ) and that the semi-norm k ˚Ln
∆ψklog obeys a uniform Lasota-
Yorke inequality for ψ ∈ Blog(M ). We prove neither property here under our weaker assumptions,
and give a substantially diﬀerent proof of the spectral gap.
We begin by assuming that there exists g ∈ B such that ˚L∆g = λβeiωg for some ω ∈ [0, 2π). We
will show this implies ω = 0 and g is a multiple of ψ∗.
Using the fact that g is an eigenfunction, we have

Since ψ∗ > δ0 on ∆0, we may choose K > |g|∆0|∞ suﬃciently large so that g1 := (Re(g)+Kψ∗)/C >
0 on ˚∆, where Re(g) denotes the real part of g and C > 0 is chosen so that R˚∆ g1 dm = 1. Note
that by (4.16) and the conditional invariance of ψ∗, by choice of K, there exists δ1 such that for
each ℓ > 0,

Deﬁne gs = sg1 + (1 − s)ψ∗ and J = {s ∈ R : inf ˚∆ gs > 0}. Note that J contains [0, 1] and by
(4.17), J is open. To see that in fact J ⊃ R+, we will use the following lemma.
Lemma 4.10. Let ψ ∈ B with kψklog < ∞ and let An,T ⊂ ˚∆n ∩ ˚f−n
of Lemma 4.5. Suppose there exists a function r(n) with r(n) → 0 as n → ∞ such that

Now let s0 > 1 be the right endpoint of J. Since gs → gs0 uniformly on each ∆ℓ,j as s → s0 from
the left, we have gs0 ∈ Blog(C2) as well. The following lemma from [BDM] completes the proof of
the proposition.
Lemma 4.11. ([BDM, Lemma 3.2]) gs0 is bounded away from 0 on ∆.

We refer the interested reader to [BDM] for the proof of this lemma since it requires no changes in
the current setting. The proof uses only the mixing property of ˚f∆ and the fact that gs0 ∈ Blog(C2).
The lemma implies s0 ∈ J and so J ⊃ R+. The fact that gs > 0 for all s > 0 implies g1 > ψ∗. But
sinceR g1 dm =R ψ∗ dm = 1, we conclude that in fact g1 = ψ∗. This implies that Re(g) = (C−K)ψ∗
and using the linearity of ˚L∆, we conclude that Im(g) is also a multiple of ψ∗ and so ω = 0.
We have proved that λβ has strictly larger modulus than all other eigenvalues of ˚L∆ and that its
multiplicity is one. The last step is to eliminate Jordan blocks for λβ. Suppose there exists g ∈ B
such that ( ˚L∆ − λβI)g = ψ∗. It follows that ˚Ln

4.3. Application of abstract results and proof of Theorem 1.6. In this section, we complete
the proof of Theorem 1.6 by projecting the results of Theorem 4.12 to our underlying map f with
neutral ﬁxed point. In order to invoke these results, we ﬁx t ∈ [0, 1) and show that our constructed
tower satisﬁes assumptions (P1)-(P4) with respect to the measure mt and potential ϕH
∆ induced by
tφH − p(t).
(P1) follows immediately from Lemma 4.1 with α = p(t) > 0.

(P2) follows from Lemma 4.2 and the assumption that − log λt < p(t).
(P4) is satisﬁed since Df is bounded above and also below by 1 so that Snϕ∆(x) grows at most
linearly in n for x ∈ ∆0.
It remains to verify (P3). First choose 0 < δ 6 γ log 2
1+γ for reasons to be made clear below. Standard
estimates (see for example [DF, Lemma 3.1]) imply that there exists Cd > 0 such that for all n ∈ N:
(D1) if f n(x) ∈ Y , then Df n(x) > max{2, C−1
(D2) if f i(x), f i(y) lie in the same element of P1 for each 0 6 i 6 n, then

d n1+ 1

γ };

The ﬁrst ratio above is bounded by |ψ|C q(I). To estimate the second ratio, note that if s(x, y) = n,
then by construction of ∆, f i(π(x)) and f i(π(y)) lie in the same element of P1 for all i 6 τ n(x). By
(D1), Df τ n
(π(x)) > 2n, so that using also (D2), |π(x)−π(y)| 6 C2−n. Thus |π(x)−π(y)|q 6 Ce−δn
as long as q > δ/ log 2, as required.

(cid:3)

By (D2) above, we see that the potential φ = − log Df is H¨older continuous with exponent γ/(1+γ).
By Lemma 4.13, the induced potential ϕ∆ will be Lipschitz in the metric dδ if
1+γ , i.e. if
δ 6 γ log 2
1+γ , which is what we chose initially. Then (D2) also implies the bounded requirement of
(P3) for eSnφ with this choice of δ.

This extends to the potential tSnφ − np(t) for t ∈ [0, 1] since

1+γ ,

6 Ct| log eSnφ(x)−Snφ(y)| 6 C′t|f n(x) − f n(y)|

where we have used the fact that φ 6 0 and p(t) > 0. Thus (P3) is satisﬁed with this choice of δ
for all t ∈ [0, 1].
The ﬁnal point to check is that ˚f∆ is transitive and aperiodic on the partition {∆ℓ,j}. This is
implied by the following.

28

M.F. DEMERS AND M. TODD

Lemma 4.14. Suppose that H is non-swallowing. Then for each base ∆0,i, there exists N = N (i)
such that ˚f n(∆0,i) ⊇ ∆0 for all n > N .

Proof. Transitivity of ˚f∆ is obvious by the non-swallowing assumption (1) on Q and ∆0 = ∪Q∈QQ.
It remains to verify aperiodicity.

By property (2) of the deﬁnition of non-swallowing, there exists i0 ∈ N such that ∆0,i0 ⊃ (1/2, 1/2+
δ) for some δ > 0. Let ∆0,j ⊆ ˚F (∆0,i0). Since ∆0,i0 is recurrent, there exists n0 ∈ N such that
˚f n0(∆0, j) ⊇ ∆0,i0. Now due to the renewal structure and the fact that ∆0,i0 contains all Yk for
k greater than some k0, if ˚f n1(∆0,i0) ⊇ ∆0,j, then also ˚f n1+1(∆0,i0) ⊇ ∆0,j. So we have both
˚f n0+n1(∆0,i0) ⊇ ∆0,i0 and ˚f n0+n1+1(∆0,i0) ⊇ ∆0,i0. Thus ˚f∆ is aperiodic.

(cid:3)

With properties (P1)-(P4) veriﬁed, we conclude by the results of the previous section that ˚L∆ has
a spectral gap on B and the conclusions of Theorem 4.12 apply.
The last step in the proof of Theorem 1.6 is to show that we can project the results of Theorem 4.12
to our open system (˚f , mt; H). For this we need the following proposition, which is an adaption of
[BDM, Prop. 4.2].

Proposition 4.15. Recall the projection Pπ,t deﬁned by (4.2) with respect to the measure mt. Let
C q(˚I) be the set of H¨older continuous functions with exponent q supported on ˚I. Then Lip(Jtπ|∆ℓ ) <
∞ for each ℓ and C q(˚I) ⊂ Pπ,tB0 for all q > δ/ log 2.

Proof. Due to conformality and the deﬁnition of mt, for x ∈ ∆ℓ, x = f ℓ

∆(y), we have

Jtπ(x) =

dmt(πx)
dmt(x)

=

dmt(π(f ℓ
dmt(y)

∆y))

=

dmt(f ℓ(πy))

dmt(πy)

= e−tSℓφ(πy)+ℓp(t).

Now by the proof of Lemma 4.13, Jtπ is Lipschitz in the metric dδ with Lipschitz constant depending
only on the level ℓ and the distortion constant from (D2).
Now let ψ ∈ C q(˚I) for some q > δ/ log 2. Recall from the proof of Lemma 4.2 the index set K
of pairs (ℓ, j) such that ℓ 6 L, π(∪(ℓ,j)∈K∆ℓ,j) = π(˚∆), and π(∆ℓ,j) ∩ π(∆ℓ′,j′) = ∅ for all pairs
(ℓ, j) 6= (ℓ′, j′) in K.
For (ℓ, j) ∈ K and x ∈ ∆ℓ,j, deﬁne ˜ψ(x) = ψ ◦ π(x)Jtπ(x). Deﬁne ˜ψ ≡ 0 elsewhere on ∆. Then it
follows from fact that Jtπ is Lipschitz on ∪ℓ6L∆ℓ and Lemma 4.13 that ˜ψ ∈ B0. Also, since the
images π(∆ℓ,j) and π(∆ℓ′,j′) are disjoint for all pairs (ℓ, j) 6= (ℓ′, j′) in K, we have Pπ,t ˜ψ = ψ. (cid:3)

We proceed to prove the items of Theorem 1.6. Fix q > 0 as in the statement of Theorem 1.6
and choose δ > 0, such that δ 6 min{ q
1+γ } so that the conditions of Lemma 4.13 and
Proposition 4.15 are satisﬁed as well as (P3).
(1) The characterization of λt < 1 as the spectral radius and the existence of a spectral gap for ˚L∆
follow immediately from Lemma 4.1 and Theorem 4.12.
It follows from the deﬁnitions of ˚LtφH−p(t) and ˚LϕH
above in the proof of Proposition 4.15, that

This relation also holds if ψ is supported on H ∪ π(˚∆) since the part of ψ on H is deleted in one
step.
Deﬁne gt = Pπ,t¯gt. Since ¯gt is bounded away from 0 on ˚∆, it follows using the index set K from
the proof of Lemma 4.2 that gt is bounded away from 0 on ˚I. Moreover, by (4.19), we have

log λt = hνt(f ) +Z tφH dνt − p(t),

due to Theorem 4.12(b) and (c). To project this relation from ∆ to I, we use Lemma 4.1, the
deﬁnition of ϕH and the fact that π : ∆ → I is at most countable-to-one to deduce hνt(f ) = h¯νt (f∆).
Indeed, νt attains the supremum of pressures over all measures η that lift to ∆. However, due to
Proposition 1.3, we conclude that the supremum of measures that lift to ∆ is in fact the supremum
of all ergodic, invariant measures supported on ˚I∞. Thus log λt = pH(t) − p(t), completing the
proof of item (2). Moreover, it follows immediately that νt is the equilibrium state for the potential
tφH − pH(t).

4.4. Proof of Corollary 1.7. First note that the statement pH(t) > 0 if and only if t < tH is
simply the deﬁnition of tH together with Proposition 1.5(a).
We next prove − log λt < p(t) if and only if pH(t) > 0. Recall that by Proposition 1.3, we have

log λt > log λt > pH(t) − p(t).

Assume pH(t) > 0. Then by the above inequality, log λt > −p(t) and we are in the setting of
Theorem 1.6: the associated transfer operator on the tower has a spectral gap and in particular,
the escape rate exists, λt = λt = λt and the variational principle holds,

log λt = pH(t) − p(t).

On the other hand, assume log λt > −p(t). Then again we are in the setting of Theorem 1.6 and
the same set of results holds, including the variational principle. This implies in particular, that
pH(t) = p(t) + log λt > 0.

Finally, we show that λt exists and the variational principle holds in all cases. The only case that
remains to be addressed is when pH(t) = 0. In this case, Proposition 1.3 implies

In fact, all inequalities must be equalities otherwise log λt > −p(t) and again we are in the case of
the spectral gap which forces pH(t) > 0 by Theorem 1.6, contrary to our assumption.

log λt > log λt > −p(t).

4.5. Proof of Theorem 1.8. Let z ∈ I and let Hε ⊃ {z}, ε ∈ (0, ε0) be a nested sequence of
intervals that are nonswallowing holes. Our ﬁrst step is to show that the sequence of conditionally
invariant densities gHε
given by item (2) of Theorem 1.6 enjoy some uniform regularity in ε. To
this end we deﬁne the variation of a function ψ on an interval J = [c, d] by,

which implies that the sequence Zn is increasing and unbounded. Thus the third term on the right

to 0 as well, since the numerator is the ﬁnal summand of the subexponentially diverging series in
the denominator.
We have shown that ˚Ltµ = λtµ and iterating this relation yields ˚Ln
t µ, which implies s = 0
so that µ = ψ∗mt is an absolutely continuous conditionally invariant probability measure with
eigenvalue λt. Indeed, due to the regularity of ψn, which is inherited by ψ∗, ψn converges pointwise
uniformly to ψ∗ on each element of PN0. Thus the convergence of ψn to ψ∗ holds in L1(mt).

6. Proof of Theorem 1.11

In this section, we will work principally with the domain Y := [1/2, 1] and the induced map
F = f τ : Y (cid:9), where τ is the ﬁrst return time to Y deﬁned earlier. Recall that F has countably
many branches created by the preimages of the intervals Jn, n > 0. Let Yn ⊂ [1/2, 1] be the interval
such that f (Yn) = Jn. Then F (Yn) = Y for each n > 0 so that F is a full-branched Gibbs-Markov
map.

Now ﬁx a family of holes (Hε)ε6ε0 satisfying assumption (H) of Section 1.4. Unlike in previous
sections, the holes Hε are not required to be elements of a Markov partition for f .

Since we are interested in the limit as Hε shrinks to a point, and thus tHε increases to 1, we will
make a standing assumption throughout this section that

tHε >

(6.1)

Our goal is to construct an invariant measure on the survivor set compatible with the punctured
potential tφHε − pHε(t) and then show that this sequence of singular measures converges weakly to
the absolutely continuous (with respect to mt) equilibrium state µt for the closed system as ε → 0.
This program will be carried out in several steps. We ﬁrst show that the transfer operator associated
with the induced punctured potential tΦHε − τ pHε(t) is quasi-compact (Section 6.1) and for small
In Section 6.3 we use the spectral gap to construct an

invariant measure for ˚F supported on Y . This measure projects to an invariant measure for ˚f on
˚I∞ and items (1)-(5) of Theorem 1.11 are proved in Sections 6.4 and 6.5.

Since we normalize the induced potential tΦHε by the punctured pressure pHε(t) rather than p(t),
the measure mt is no longer a conformal measure for this potential. In order to proceed, we ﬁrst
prove the existence of a conformal measure for this potential.

Recall the deﬁnition of the variation of a function ψ on an interval J deﬁned by (4.20).

Lemma 6.1. For t < 1, let

Pt,ε = P (tΦ − τ pHε(t)).

Then Pt,ε > 0 and there exists a (tΦ − τ pHε(t) − Pt,ε)-conformal measure ˜mt,Hε for F on Y , which
has no atoms.

Proof. First note that P (tΦ − τ p(t)) = 0. So using the fact that τ > 1, we have

0 = P (tΦ − τ p(t) + τ pHε(t) − τ pεH(t)) 6 pHε(t) − p(t) + P (tΦ − τ pHε(t)).

If Hε is a Markov hole, then since pHε(t) − p(t) = log λt < 0 by Corollary 1.7, we conclude that
Pt,ε > 0 as required. On the other hand, if Hε is not a Markov hole, we can always ﬁnd Hε′ ⊂ Hε
such that Hε′ is a Markov hole. Then the above argument implies Pt,ε′ > 0 so that by monotonicity,
Pt,ε > 0 as well.
In order to prove the existence of ˜mt,Hε, we will check that the potential tΦ− τ pHε(t) is contracting
in the sense of [LSV1].

tΦ−τ p(t)1. Since F is full-branched Gibbs Markov and the spectral radius of
LtΦ−τ p(t) on C 1(Y ) is 1, Ln0
tΦ−τ p(t)1 converges uniformly on Y to a smooth invariant density for F
which is bounded below away from 0.
Now that we have veriﬁed that the potential tΦ − τ pHε(t) is contracting, we may apply [LSV1,
Theorem 3.1] to conclude the existence of the (tΦ − τ pHε(t) − Pt,ε)-conformal measure ˜mt,Hε. (cid:3)
The importance of ˜mt,Hε is that it enables us to compute the escape of mass from Y under ˚F via a
change of variables. Deﬁne Ψ1,ε = tΦ− τ pHε(t)− Pt,ε and the corresponding punctured potential by
i=0F −i(Y \ ˜Hε)
1,ε = tΦHε − τ pHε(t)− Pt,ε. Let ˜Hε be the hole in Y induced by Hε and let ˚Y n

Before proceeding to the proof of Proposition 6.2, we make some observations about our holes
Hε. Let ˜Hε be the hole in Y induced by Hε and recall the sets {Yi,j}i,j>0 deﬁned in Section 1.4,
which denote the maximal intervals on which τ 2 is constant, Yi,j = Yi ∩ F −1(Yj). Since F is
full branched and Hε has ﬁnitely many components, it follows that ˚F 2 := F 2|˚Y 2
enjoys the ﬁnite
images condition: The set {˚F 2(Yi,j)}i,j>0 comprises a ﬁnite union of intervals. The number of these
intervals varies depending on the placement of Hε, but is uniformly bounded above.
For example, suppose z = H0 ⊂ [0, 1/2] lies in the interior of one of the intervals Ji0,j0 := Ji0 ∩
f−n
L (Yj0), for some i0 > 1, j0 > 0, where fL is the left branch of L. It follows from condition (H)
that Hε ⊂ Ji0,j0 for ε 6 ε0 since otherwise, as ε → 0, image intervals of arbitrarily short length
would be created. For i ∈ N and j < i0, j 6= j0, we have ˚F 2
ε (Yi,j) = Y , while for j > i0, j 6= j0,
we have ˚F 2
ε (Yi,j) = Y \ f i0(Hε), which is a union of two intervals, A1 = [1/2, a1] and A2 = [a2, 1].
Note that f i0(H) ⊂ Yj0. It remains to consider the intervals Yi,j with j = j0. If i < i0 and j0 < i0,
then again, ˚F 2
ε (Yi,j0) = Y \ f i0(Hε). If i > i0 and j < i0,
then ˚F 2
ε (Yi,j0) = Y \ F (f i0Hε), again the union of two intervals, A3 = [1/2, a3] and A4 = [a4, 1].
Finally, if i > i0 and j0 > i0, then ˚F 2
ε (Yi,j0) = Y \ (f i0(Hε) ∪ F (f i0Hε)), which can be at most
3 intervals, A5 = [1/2, a5], A6 = [a6, 1] and A7 = [a7, a8]. Other cases for z on the boundary of
two consecutive Ji,j or in [1/2, 1] are similar. In all cases, our assumption (H) guarantees that the
minimum length of these image intervals is uniformly bounded away from 0 in ε, making it possible
to obtain uniform Lasota-Yorke inequalities.

ε (Yi,j0) = Y , while if j0 > i0 then ˚F 2

include it to show that there is suﬃcient contraction uniformly for t ∈ [0, 1] and that the constants
are independent of ε under assumption (H).

For convenience, let us reindex the countably many intervals on which ˚F 2 is smooth and injective
by Zn = [an, bn], n ∈ N. Note that each Zn ⊂ Yi,j for some pair (i, j), although some Yi,j will
contain two or at most three Zn as described earlier. We denote by ξn the inverse of ˚F 2 restricted
to Zn. For brevity, we will denote the potential for ˚L2

SLOW AND FAST ESCAPE FOR OPEN INTERMITTENT MAPS

Proof of Sublemma 6.5. We want to maximize eG on Y and show that this maximum is less than
1/3. For t = 1, this maximum is 1/4 since pH(1) = p(1) = 0. From now on, we assume t < 1.

We begin by estimating the weakest contraction due to

etΦHε−τ p(t) = (DF )−te−τ p(t).

Clearly, this is maximized when τ = 1 and DF = 2, i.e. at a point in Y ∩f−1(Y ). We will maximize
this by minimizing its reciprocal,6 i.e. egγ (t),

where

gγ(t) = t log 2 + pγ(t).

We have added the subscript γ to the expression for the pressure p(t) to emphasize its dependence
on γ. We proceed to minimize gγ(t) over γ ∈ (0, 1) and t ∈ [0, 1].
Note that gγ(t) is strictly convex with gγ(0) = log 2 = gγ(1), for all γ ∈ (0, 1), so that its minimum
occurs at an interior point of [0, 1]. We will ﬁnd the minimum of gγ by ﬁnding the point of
intersection of two lines that lie below it:
lower bounds on the tangent lines to gγ at t = 0 and
t = 1.
At t = 1, g′γ(1) = log 2 − χγ(µ1) > 0 where χγ(µ1) is the positive Lyapunov exponent with respect
to the SRB measure µ1 for f = fγ. Note that χγ(µ1) ↓ 0 as γ ↑ 1 so we take as a lower bound for
this tangent line, the line u = t log 2. This line lies below gγ and u(1) = log 2 = gγ(1). Although
u(t) is not tangent to gγ(t), it is the limit of tangent lines at t = 1 as γ → 1.
At t = 0, g′γ(0) = log 2 − χγ(µ0) < 0, where µ0 is the measure of maximal entropy for f . We
proceed to derive an upper bound for χγ(µ0) that is independent of γ ∈ (0, 1).
Let aγ := f−1
equal weight to all two-cylinders of the partition {[0, 1/2), [1/2, 1]}, i.e.,

L (1/2), where fL denotes the left branch of f = fγ. We will use the fact that µ0 gives

µ0([0, aγ ]) = µ0([aγ, 1/2]) = µ0([1/2, 3/4]) = µ0([3/4, 1]) = 1/4.

We want to maximize

χγ(µ0) =Z[0,aγ ]

log |Dfγ| dµ0 +Z[aγ ,1/2]

log |Dfγ| dµ0 +Z[1/2,1]

log |Dfγ| dµ0.

(6.6)

The last integral above simply equals 1
strictly increasing for x ∈ [0, 1/2], so that for all x ∈ [aγ, 1/2] and all γ ∈ (0, 1),

2 log 2. For the ﬁrst two integrals, notice that Dfγ(x) is

Dfγ(x) 6 Dfγ(1/2) = 2 + γ 6 3 = Df1(1/2).

On the other hand, for x ∈ [0, aγ ],

Dfγ(x) 6 Dfγ(aγ) = 1 + (1 + γ)(2aγ )γ.

We claim that this expression is increasing in γ and so is maximized when γ = 1.

Claim. supγ∈(0,1) Dfγ(aγ) = Df1(a1) = √5.

6To prove Sublemma 6.5 for the potential ΨH

1,ε, one must instead minimize, 2tepHε (t)+Pt,ε . But observe that

0 = P (tΦ − τ p(t)) = P (tΦ − τ pHε(t) + τ (pHε(t) − p(t))) 6 pHε (t) − p(t) + P (tΦ − τ pHε(t))

since τ > 1. Thus Pt,ε > p(t) − pHε(t) and so 2tepHε (t)+Pt,ε > egγ (t), and the estimate reduces to the current estimate
for ΨHε
2 .

=
˚LtΦHε−τ p(t) is a perturbation of LΨ2 using the framework of [KL] to conclude that this spectral
gap persists for the punctured transfer operator for suﬃciently small holes under assumption (H).
Indeed, it will follow that the spectral gap enjoyed by ˚LtΦHε−τ p(t) has a lower bound that is uniform

We begin with the following lemma.

|||P1ψ − P2ψ||| = sup{|P1ψ − P2ψ|L1(mt) : kψkBV 6 1}.

|||LΨ2 − ˚LΨH

2 ||| 6 mt( ˜H ∪ F −1( ˜H)).

Proof. Let ψ ∈ BV (Y ), kψkBV 6 1. Then in particular, |ψ|∞ 6 1. So,

, respectively, we conclude that both vary continuously in ε for ε suﬃciently small.

For a family of holes satisfying (H), since mt( ˜Hε ∪ F −1( ˜Hε)) → 0 as ε → 0 and using Proposi-
tion 6.2 and Lemma 6.7, it follows from [KL, Corollary 1] that the spectrum and spectral projectors
corresponding to eigenvalues outside the disk of radius σ1/2 vary Holder continuously in the size of
the perturbation.
Since LΨ2 has spectral radius 1 and enjoys a spectral gap, let ¯βt,0 < 1 denote the magnitude of its
second largest eigenvalue. Letting ¯Λt,ε and ¯βt,ε denote the largest and second largest eigenvalues
of ˚LΨHε
In
particular, we may choose ε0 suﬃciently small that ¯Λt,ε − ¯βt,ε > (1 − ¯βt,0)/2 for all ε 6 ε0.

Our next lemma shows that in fact the bound obtained in the previous lemma is continuous in ε.
Lemma 6.9. Let (Hε)ε6ε0 be a collection of holes centered at z ∈ I with Hε → {z} as ε → 0. Then
for t ∈ [0, 1],

pHε(t) → p(t),

tHε → 1 and Pt,ε → 0 as ε → 0.

Proof. Note that for t = 1, the statement of the lemma is trivial since pHε(1) = p(1) = 0 and so
P1,ε = − log ¯Λ1,ε is continuous in ε by Step 1. We now focus on t < 1. Since the quantities of
interest are clearly monotone in the size of the hole, we need only prove the lemma for Markov
holes.

By Corollary 1.7, we have log λHε
have λHε

t → 1 as ε → 0. Thus pHε(t) → p(t) as ε → 0.

t = pHε(t) − p(t). By (4.23) and the comment following it, we

44

M.F. DEMERS AND M. TODD

Now ﬁx t < 1. Since p(t) > 0, by the previous paragraph we may choose ε > 0 suﬃciently small
such that pHε(t) > 0. By Proposition 1.5, this implies tHε > t and by monotonicity, tHε′ > t for all
ε′ 6 ε. Since this is true for each t < 1, we have tHε → 1 as ε → 0.
Finally, consider the rescaled transfer operator ePt,εLΨ1,ε = LtΦ−τ pHε (t) whose spectral radius on
BV (Y ) is ePt,ε. Replacing LΨ1,ε by this rescaled operator in the statement and proof of Lemma 6.8
yields,

kLtΦ−τ pHε (t) − LtΦ−τ p(t)kBV 6 C(p(t) − pHε(t)).

Using now that pHε(t) → p(t) as ε → 0 and the fact that LtΦ−τ p(t) has a spectral gap with
leading eigenvalue 1, we conclude using standard perturbation theory that the leading eigenvalue
of LtΦ−τ pHε (t) tends to 1 as ε → 0. This implies Pt,ε → 0 as required.

and ˚LΨHε

Since Pt,ε → 0 and pHε(t) → p(t) as ε → 0, Lemmas 6.8 and 6.9 imply that as operators on
BV (Y ), ˚LΨH
are close so that their spectra and spectral projectors vary continuously
by standard perturbation theory (see [K]).
Thus for ε suﬃciently small, the largest eigenvalue of ˚LΨH
, Λt,ε, is close to ¯Λt,ε, while the second
largest eigenvalue, βt,ε is as close as we like to ¯βt,ε (if it lies outside the disk of radius σ1/2). Since
by Step 1, ¯Λt,ε and ¯βt,ε are uniformly bounded away from one another for all ε 6 ε0, we may further
shrink ε0 if necessary so that Λt,ε and βt,ε are uniformly bounded away from one another for all
ε 6 ε0. Thus ˚LΨH

measure on the survivor set deﬁned by (6.11). Then

νε(ψ) → ν0(ψ) as ε → 0 for each ψ ∈ C 0(Y ) ∪ BV (Y ),

where ν0 is the unique invariant measure absolutely continuous with respect to mt for F , the induced
map without the hole.

Proof. Note that for ε > 0, νε is singular with respect to mt for ε > 0, but that dν0 = g0dmt where
g0 ∈ BV (Y ) is the unique invariant probability density for LtΦ−τ p(t).7
Let ¯gεdmt, ¯gε ∈ BV (Y ), denote the conditionally invariant probability measure formed using the
eigenvector ¯gε for ˚LΨHε
formed
via the limit in (6.11), but using ¯gεdmt in place of gεd ˜mt,Hε.
For ψ ∈ BV (Y ), we have

To estimate the ﬁrst term above, we write

|νε(ψ) − ¯νε(ψ)| 6 |eε(ψgε) − ¯eε(ψgε)| + |¯eε(ψgε) − ¯eε(ψ¯gε)| .

kΠε − ¯ΠεkBV 6 ζ(ε).

Since the term on the left of the inequality is of order ζ(ε) and the second term on the right is of
the same order, then the same must be true of the ﬁrst term on the right. It follows then that eε(·)
and ¯eε(·) can be made arbitrarily close on BV functions by choosing ε small. Thus the ﬁrst term
in (6.13) can be made arbitrarily small by choosing ε small.

For the second term of (6.13), we estimate,

which can again be made arbitrarily small. This completes the estimate on the ﬁrst term of (6.12).

The ﬁrst term above tends to zero as ε tends to 0 due to Lemma 6.7, while the second term tends
to zero by [KL, Corollary 1].

Putting these estimates together with (6.13) in (6.12) completes the proof of convergence of νε to ν0
when integrated against functions in BV (Y ). We extend this convergence to continuous functions
by approximation. For ψ1 ∈ C 0(Y ), let δ > 0 and choose a step function ψ2 ∈ BV (Y ) such that
|ψ1 − ψ2|∞ < δ. Then

|νε(ψ1) − ν0(ψ1)| 6 |νε(ψ1) − νε(ψ2)| + |νε(ψ2) − ν0(ψ2)| + |ν0(ψ2) − ν0(ψ1)|

6 2δ + |νε(ψ2) − ν0(ψ2)|,

and the last term tends to 0 as ε → 0 since ψ2 ∈ BV (Y ). Since δ > 0 was arbitrary, this implies
the required convergence on continuous functions.

6.4. An invariant measure for ˚fε on ˚I∞ε . In this section, we push the invariant measure νε = νY,ε
to obtain an invariant measure νHε for ˚fε which inherits good properties from νY,ε,
on ˚Y ∞ε onto ˚I∞ε
thus completing parts (1) and (5) of Theorem 1.11.

next lemma shows that in fact τ is uniformly integrable with respect to νY,ε for all ε suﬃciently

Proof. Fix k > 0 and let e(tΦ−τ pHε (t)−Pt,ε)(Yk) denote the maximum of etΦ−τ pHε (t)−Pt,ε on Yk. Since
F (Yk) = [1/2, 1], we have for n > 1,

k0 increases.

Lemma 6.12. R τ dνY,ε →R τ dνY,0 as ε → 0 .
Proof. Fix δ > 0. By 6.16, we may choose k0 so that Rτ >k0
(including ε = 0). Since τ is constant on each Yk, we have τ · 1{τ 6k0} ∈ BV (Y ). Thus

τ dνY,ε < δ for all ε suﬃciently small

For part (5) of Theorem 1.11, we need to show that νHε → µt as ε → 0, where µt is the equilibrium
state (absolutely continuous with respect to mt) for the unpunctured potential tφ − p(t). This is
straightforward with Lemmas 6.11 and 6.12 in hand since µt is simply the projection of νY,0 to I
via the formula analogous to (6.14). Fix a function ψ with bounded variation on I and δ > 0.

τ dνY,ε < δ. Then

Now the terms on the second line are bounded by 2δkψkBV and each of the ﬁnitely many diﬀerences
on the right hand side of the ﬁrst line tend to 0 with ε by Lemma 6.12 and Proposition 6.10. Since
δ > 0 was arbitrary, this proves the required convergence of νHε to µt when integrated against func-
tions of bounded variation. To complete the proof of items (1) and (5) of Theorem 1.11, we extend
this convergence to continuous functions by approximation as in the proof of Proposition 6.10.

6.4.1. Interpretation of νHε. In this section, we prove items (2) and (3) of Theorem 1.11. We
restrict to a sequence of holes (Hε)ε6ε0 satisfying (H) and such that ε0 is suﬃciently small that
˚LtΦHε0 −τ pHε0 (t)−Pt,ε
Given a Markov hole H = Hε, set

has a spectral gap by Proposition 6.6.

We ﬁrst note that

so P (ΨH

t ) = 0.

ψH

:= tφH − pH(t) − P (tΦH − τ pH(t)) · 1Y .

ΨH

t = Sτ ψH

t = tΦH − τ pH(t) − P (tΦH − τ pH(t)),

It follows from [BDM] that the measure νY,ε constructed in Section 6.3 is a Gibbs measure with
Gibbs constant 0 for the potential tΦH − τ pH(t) − Pt,ε − log Λt,ε. So by Theorem 2.2,

0 = P (cid:0)tΦH − τ pH(t) − Pt,ε − log Λt,ε(cid:1) = P (tΦH − τ pH(t)) − P (tΦ − τ pH(t)) − log Λt,ε.

48

Hence

M.F. DEMERS AND M. TODD

log Λt,ε = P (tΦH − τ pH(t)) − P (tΦ − τ pH(t))

and we conclude that νY,ε is a Gibbs measure for ΨH
is an equilibrium state for ΨH
Lemma 6.11 and since whenever pH(t) = 0, then t > γ

t provided the integral of ΨH

t . Then by Theorem 2.2, we know that this
is ﬁnite. This latter fact follows from

1+γ by Proposition 1.5.

Since

0 = P (ΨH

t ) = hνY,ε +Z ΨH

t dνY,ε = hνY,ε +Z tΦH − τ pH(t) − P (tΦH − τ pHε(t)) dνY,ε,

Abramov’s formula implies

i.e.,

hνH +Z ψH

t dνH = 0,

hνH +Z tφH dνH = P (tΦH − τ pH(t))νH (Y ) + pH(t).

(6.17)

In particular, νH is an equilibrium state for ψH
holes.

t , which proves (2) of Theorem 1.11 for Markov

We will next show that the free energy given by (6.17) varies continuously in ε. Using this and the
fact that Markov holes are dense in our sequence (Hε)ε6ε0, we will be able to conclude that in fact
(6.17) holds for non-Markov holes as well.

For a given t ∈ (0, 1), note that setting

εt := inf{ε 6 ε0 : P (tΦHε) > 0},
we have P (tΦHεt ) = 0 whenever εt is ﬁnite. Moreover, set ε1 = 0.

We will address two cases, noting that for some values of t 6 tHε0 , Case 2 will be empty.

Case 1: ε 6 εt. In this case pHε(t) = hνHε +R tφHε dνHε, and we can show the continuity of this
quantity via the Implicit Function Theorem and the fact that in this case s = pHε(t) is the unique
solution to P (tΦHε − τ s) = 0.
Case 2: ε > εt. In this case pHε(t) = 0 and hνHε +R tφHε dνHε = P (tΦHε)νHε(Y ), so we need to
prove continuity of induced pressure and νHε(Y ) in ε.
Lemma 6.13. Fix t ∈ (0, 1] and s ∈ R. Let (Hε)ε∈[0,ε0] be a collection of holes centered at z ∈ I
with ε < ε′ implying Hε ⊂ Hε′. If P (tΦ− τ s) < ∞, then ε 7→ P (tΦHε − τ s) is continuous on [0, ε0].

Proof. We will set s = 0 since the proof for any other value is analogous. Clearly ε 7→ P (tΦHε) is
monotone decreasing. Since we can approximate any hole Hε by elements of the Markov partition,
it is suﬃcient to consider monotone sequences (Hεn)n of Markov holes. We will prove that for Hε,
for any η > 0 there exists n ∈ N such that P (tΦHε\Cn) − P (tΦHε) < η where Cn is any n-cylinder.
This then implies the lemma.
By assumption on Φ, we have P (tΦ) < ∞. Also the spectral radius of LtΦ on BV (Y ) is eP (tΦ). On
the one hand,

while on the other, RY LtΦ1 dmt = RY eτ p(t) dmt, since mt is (tΦ − τ p(t))-conformal. Thus eτ p(t) ∈

L1(mt).

|LtΦ1|L1(mt) 6 kLtΦkBV k1kBV < ∞,

We claim that ˚LtΦH
since

is a perturbation of LtΦ. This follows precisely as in the proof of Lemma 6.7
| ˚LtΦψ − ˚LtΦHε ψ|L1(mt) 6 |ψ|∞Z ˜Hε∪F −1 ˜Hε

eτ p(t) dmt,

and this expression tends to 0 with ε since eτ p(t) ∈ L1(mt).
Since P (tΦ) > 0, it follows from the above that in the perturbative regime ε 6 ε0, we have
P (tΦHε) > −t log 2. Let δ := P (tΦHε) + t log 2 > 0. Since DF > 2, we have tΦ 6 −t log 2 for t > 0,
so

tΦ − P (tΦHε) 6 −δ.

So for large n, subtracting an n-cylinder Cn from an existing hole adds at most

etSnΦ(x) 6 e−δn+nP (tΦHε )

(cid:3)

We use the lemma to prove Cases 1 and 2.
Cae 1. Noting that for ﬁxed t ∈ R and ε > 0, s 7→ P (tΦHε − τ s) is strictly decreasing, Lemma 6.13
and the Implicit Function Theorem (in its continuous version) imply that ε 7→ pHε(t) is continuous
for ε 6 εt.

Case 2. In this case pHε(t) = 0 so the free energy of νHε is given by P (tΦHε)νHε(Y ), according

to (6.17). Lemma 6.13 gives continuity of P (tΦHε), while continuity of νHε(Y ) = R τ dνY,ε follows

from Lemma 6.12 for ε 6 ε0.

6.5. Analyticity of the free energy for t > tH . In this section we focus on the pressure (or free
energy) of the measures νHε = νHε,t constructed previously. Fixing ε suﬃciently small, we drop
the subscript ε and denote Hε simply by H. We will show that the pressure

hνH,t +Z tφH dνH,t,

is an analytic function of t for t > tH, thus proving item (4) of Theorem 1.11 and completing the
proof of that theorem.
For brevity, we will denote ˚LtΦH by ˚Lt in this section (recall that pH(t) = 0 for t > tH). Fix
s = tH +1

and the interchange of sums is justiﬁed once we show that the series of operatorsP∞n=0 Ls,n, where
Ls,nψ = ˚Ls(ψesΦH (t−s)n

n! Φn), converges in the operator norm on BV (Y ). This will follow from our

next lemma.

Lemma 6.14. There exists CH > 0, depending only on H and f , but not t, such that kLs,nkBV 6
C|t − s|n. Thus ˚Lt is an analytic perturbation of ˚Ls for t ∈ (tH , 1). Moreover, the perturbation is
continuous on the closure [tH , 1].

Similarly, the operator for the closed system Lt = LtΦ is an analytic perturbation of LsΦ for
t ∈ (tH, 1) and continuous on the closure.

Proof. We will show the estimates for Ls,n using the punctured potential ΦH. The corresponding
estimates for Φ are nearly identical and are omitted.

Let Kj,i = [aj,i, bj,i] denote the images of intervals of monotonicity for ˚F for which τ = j and let
ξj denote the inverse branch of F on Kj,i. Note that by assumption on H, there are a ﬁnite and
uniformly bounded number of i for each j, and if H = ∅, then there is only one i per j, thus the
inverse ξj depends only on j and not on i. Now for ψ ∈ BV (Y ), we estimate following (6.2) and

hνH,t +Z tφH dνH,t =

(6.19)

where ΛH,t is the largest eigenvalue of ˚LtΦH−Pt and Pt = P (tΦ) is the largest eigenvalue of LtΦ
(both as operators on BV (Y )). Lemma 6.14 implies that both ΛH,t and Pt vary analytically in t
for t ∈ (tH, 1), and are continuous on the closure of this interval. All that remains to consider is
the denominator of the fraction on the right hand side of the above expression for the free energy
of νH,t.

t = ΛH,t˜gH

t . (Alternatively one can derive the existence of ηH

t be the unique probability density in BV (Y ) satisfying ˚LtΦH−Pt ˜gH

Let ˜gH
t . Now since
tΦH − Pt is a contracting potential of bounded variation (see the proof of Lemma 6.1), it follows
t with eigenvalue ΛH,t, supported on ˚Y ∞,
from [LSV1] that ˚LtΦH−Pt admits a conformal measure ηH
such that νY,t = ˜gH
t ηH
t as in Section 4.3 in the
proof of Theorem 1.6.)
Since ˚LtΦH−Pt enjoys a spectral gap by Proposition 6.6, we have the following spectral decomposi-

where the spectral radius of Rt is strictly smaller than ΛH,t, ΠtRt = RtΠt = 0 and Π2
Moreover,

˚LtΦH−Ptψ = ΛH,tΠtψ + Rtψ,

and Πt is analytic as an operator on BV (Y ). It follows that R ψ dηH
ψ ∈ BV (Y ).
While τ /∈ BV (Y ), we do have ˚LtΦH−Ptτ ∈ BV (Y ). Thus, Πt( ˚LtΦH−Ptτ ) is analytic in t. It follows
from (6.20) and the analyticity of ˜gH

this with (6.19) proves that the free energy of νH,t varies analytically in t.

7. The swallowing cases

In this section we describe possible behaviors of escape through a swallowing hole and explore ways
in which transitivity on the survivor set can fail. For simplicity, we always assume that H is an
interval. Although the following list is not exhaustive (for example, a hole can be a union of intervals
and divide the open system into any number of transitive components), further generalizations will
be a combination of the situations described below, with some components leaking into others, and
the component with the slowest rate of escape dominating the rest.

7.1. Case 1: The hole contains 0. This is the simplest case, when H = (0, a). Then the system
is uniformly hyperbolic and the classical analysis for uniformly expanding maps holds: the transfer
operator acting on an appropriate space of functions (H¨older continuous in the Markov case, and
functions of bounded variation in the non-Markov case) will have spectral gap, the largest eigenvalue
will correspond to the escape rate and the corresponding eigenfunction will deﬁne a conditionally
invariant measure absolutely continuous with respect to the conformal measure mt. See [DY] for
references.

7.2. Case 2: H = (a, 1] for a 6 1/2. In this case, only a single branch will remain for the open
system and the dynamics are trivial: intervals map progressively to the right until they enter the
hole. The escape rate here is clearly p(t) since ˚I n = [0, ˚f−n(a)] and the conformality of mt implies
that mt(Jk−1) = etSkφ−kp(t) since f k(Jk−1) = I for each k > 1, so that

lim
n→∞

log mt(˚I n) = lim
n→∞
where na is the index such that ˚f−n(a) ∈ Jna .
For t < 1, Theorem 1.9 gives the existence of physically relevant accim with escape rate p(t). For
t = 1, the only limiting distribution is δ0 ([DF]).

log mt(∪k>naJk) = −p(t),

7.3. Case 3: Hole to the left of 1/2, not capturing 0. If H = (a, b) is a collection of adjacent
1-cylinders of P1 strictly between 1/2 and 0 then the system is divided into two components,
L = [0, a] and R = [b, 1]. Note that L maps to itself and to H, but not to R, while R maps to itself,
to L and to H.

t and the associated absolutely continuous invariant measure by µr

The dynamics restricted to R is uniformly hyperbolic and so the classical results hold regarding
escape rate and spectral gap for the associated transfer operator. We denote the escape rate out of
R by log λr
t . On the other hand,
the dynamics on L are completely dominated by the tail as described in Case 2 above.
There are two possibilities for how measures evolve in such a system. If − log λr
t < p(t), then escape
is slower from R than from L (note that this cannot happen when t = 1). Since R maps to L,
the overall escape rate matches that of R, − log λr
t , any limiting distribution obtained by pushing
∗ mt/|˚f n
forward and renormalizing mt, i.e. as a limit of ˚f n
∗ mt| will be fully supported on I \ H. In
fact, this limiting distribution must be a multiple of µr
The second possibility is that − log λr
t > p(t). In this case, the escape rate from L is slower than the
escape rate from R, but since L does not map to R, any limiting distribution obtained by pushing
forward and renormalizing mt must be identically 0 on R. Any such limit point will have a density
on L with escape rate p(t) for t < 1. For t = 1, δ0 will be the only limit point.

t on R.

Note that both possibilities will occur as t varies in [0, 1]. Due to the uniformly hyperbolic behavior
on R, for Markov holes we have the variational equation for the open system, − log λr
r (t),
where pH
r (t) is the punctured pressure for the open system on R. So the two cases above can be
If t = 0, we have pH
equivalently characterized as pH
r (0) equal to the
topological entropy of the survivor set on R, which is positive since R contains a horseshoe; if
t = 1, then pH
r (1) < 0 since p(1) = 0 and the rate of escape from R with respect to Lebesgue
measure is exponential.

t = p(t)−pH

r (t) > 0 or pH

r (t) < 0.

7.4. Case 4: H = (1/2, a), for some 1/2 < a < 1. Since H contains a right neighborhood of 1/2,
the set [b, 1] is invariant for the open system, where b = f (a) > 0. As in Case 3, the system splits

SLOW AND FAST ESCAPE FOR OPEN INTERMITTENT MAPS

into two components, L = [0, b) which is single branched and dominated by the tail, and R = [b, 1],
which is uniformly hyperbolic. The diﬀerence is that now the leakage is from L to R and not from
R to L.
Considering again the two possibilities, if − log λr
matches − log λr
and 0 on L.
On the other hand, if − log λr
t > p(t), then the overall escape rate will be p(t), and densities will
evolve on L as in Case 2 above. For t < 1, limit points of ˚f n
∗ mt| will be fully supported on
I \ H and the density on R will be a pushforward average of the limiting density on L. For t = 1,
δ0 will be the only limit point.

t < p(t) then as above, the overall escape rate

t , but now the limiting distribution obtained from ˚f n

∗ mt| is simply µr

∗ mt/|˚f n

∗ mt/|˚f n

7.5. Case 5: H = (3/4, 7/8). This is anomalous in the sense that if the hole were H = (3/4, 1],
then H would be non-swallowing, so we see that a subset of a non-swallowing hole can be swallowing.

In this case, the system once again divides into two transitive components, L = [0, 3/4) and
R = [7/8, 1], with L mapping to R, but R not mapping to L.

The dynamics on L acts as if H were simply (3/4, 1] and so the theorems of Section 1.4 apply to this
system. The dynamics on R are simply those of the doubling map with a single surviving branch,
so the classical results for uniformly hyperbolic systems apply to this restricted system. In fact, the
escape rate from R is necessarily p(t) + t log 2. The escape rate from L is − log λℓ
ℓ (t)
by Corollary 1.7, where pH
ℓ (t) is the punctured pressure for the open system restricted to L. So for
all t ∈ [0, 1], we have that the escape rate from L is strictly slower than the escape rate from R.
Thus, for t < 1 any limit points of ˚f n
∗ mt| are fully supported on I \ H and are determined
by the limiting behavior of the open system on L. As usual, for t = 1 the sole limit point is δ0.

t = p(t) − pH
