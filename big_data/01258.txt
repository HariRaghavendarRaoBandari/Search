The “failed Kondo insulator” CeNiSn has long been suspected to be a nodal metal, with a node
in the hybridization matrix elements. Here we carry out a series of Nernst eﬀect experiments to
delineate whether the severely anisotropic magnetotransport coeﬃcients do indeed derive from a
nodal metal or can simply be explained by a highly anisotropic Fermi surface. Our experiments
reveal that despite an almost 20-fold anisotropy in the Hall conductivity, the large Nernst signal is
isotropic. Taken in conjunction with the magnetotransport anisotropy, these results provide strong
support for an isotropic Fermi surface with a large anisotropy in quasiparticle mass derived from a
nodal hybridization.

There is a wide and growing interest in electron mate-
rials with topologically protected excitation spectra, in-
cluding Z2 topological insulators and topological super-
conductors [1–3] and, most recently, topologically pro-
tected Weyl semimetals [4, 5]. Rare earth heavy fermion
systems have recently emerged as a new venue to ex-
plore the interplay of strong correlations with topology
[6–9]: the strong electron-electron interactions and spin-
orbit coupling make these systems ideal candidates for
research in this area. The class of Kondo insulators,
such as SmB6, has received much attention as candidate
strongly interacting Z2 topological insulators. The little-
known family of Kondo semimetals [10–13] may provide
a second example of such topological protection. These
compounds are considered to be failed Kondo insulators,
in which the hybridization gap contains a node that closes
the gap in certain directions, giving rise to a semimetal
with a pseudogap. Transport studies on these materials
have conﬁrmed the presence of a large anisotropy in the
magnetotransport, but such anisotropies are not in them-
selves an indication of a nodal hybridization, and could
derive from anisotropic Fermi surface geometries.

In this paper we carry out a series of magneto-
thermoelectric measurements on the Kondo semimetal
CeNiSn. They reveal that unlike the Hall conductiv-
ity, which is highly anisotropic, the large Nernst eﬀect
is essentially isotropic. We show how this unexpected
isotropy rules out an anisotropic Fermi surface geome-
try and is a natural consequence of cancellations between
mean free path and mass anisotropies expected in a nodal
semimetal. This deﬁnite understanding of the material’s
bulk properties is an important prelude to any future
studies of putative surface contributions.

CeNiSn is a heavy electron material with emergent
semimetallic properties. When it develops coherence at
low temperatures, a pseudogap opens in its electronic
density of states, as revealed by both tunneling [14, 15]
and nuclear magnetic resonance [16, 17] studies. Modest
magnetic ﬁelds are suﬃcient to remove the pseudogap
[15]. The material exhibits marked anisotropy in its mag-

netotransport properties [18–21]. To account for this un-
usual behavior, Ikeda and Miyake proposed a hybridiza-
tion model for this Kondo lattice system [10], treating
it as a Kondo insulator in which the hybridization gap
contains a node along the crystallographic a-axis. The
presence of this node leads to a “V”-shaped electronic
density of states, a feature which is consistent with both
tunneling and NMR measurements [14–17].

An important aspect of this problem which has not
received much attention is the Fermi surface and mo-
mentum space structure of CeNiSn. One of the most
striking features of CeNiSn is the anisotropy in the Hall
conductivity. As will be shown below (Fig. 3), it is al-
most 20-fold between orbits within the basal (bc-)plane
and those that are perpendicular to it. Conventionally,
Hall conductivity anisotropies are associated with corre-
sponding anisotropies in the mean free path: according
to the Ong formula, the Hall conductivity is given by [22]

σxy =

as ~k moves around the Fermi surface on orbits perpendic-
ular to the applied magnetic ﬁeld ~B = (0, 0, Bz). ~z is the
unit vector along z and Φ0 = h/e is the ﬂux quantum.

A 20-fold anisotropy in the Hall conductivity thus re-
quires a corresponding anisotropy in the electronic mean
free paths. Although this large anisotropy has been in-
terpreted in terms of the nodal hybridization model, a
priori the most natural interpretation would be a one-
band model with a severely anisotropic Fermi surface.

Only in combination with the isotropic Nernst eﬀect pre-
sented here we can eliminate this possiblilty, and pro-
vide a deﬁnitive interpretation in terms of a nodal Kondo
semimetal.

High-quality single crystals grown by the Czochralski
technique in a radio-frequency furnace and puriﬁed by
solid state electron transport [23] were investigated by
a steady-state heat transport technique with one heater
and diﬀerential thermocouples. To conform to the stan-
dard x, y, z notation, in the following we refer to the a-
axis as z, and to b and c as x and y, respectively. To mea-
sure the Nernst signal Nyx = Ey/∇xT and the Nernst
coeﬃcient νyx = Nyx/(µ0Hz) we apply a temperature
gradient ∇xT along x and a magnetic ﬁeld µ0Hz along z,
which generates an electrical ﬁeld Ey along y. Other Nij
are obtained via cyclic index permutations. The trans-
verse temperature gradient ∇yT due to the Righi-Leduc
eﬀect was estimated to be less than 2% of the longitudinal
gradient ∇xT , making any thermopower contributions to
the large Nernst signal negligible. Thus, the experimen-
tally realized adiabatic condition with thermally ﬂoating
side edges of the sample corresponds, for our samples,
approximately to the isothermal condition that is prefer-
entially treated by theories. In addition, measurements
of the electrical resistivity and the Hall coeﬃcient were
performed in a commercial physical property measure-
ment system (Fig. 1).

Figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of Nij and
νij (insets) for three diﬀerent conﬁgurations in diﬀerent
magnetic ﬁelds. The absolute values of Nij (and νij)
strongly increase below 10 K as the pseudogap opens.
The maximum value of 120 µV/K reached for |Nyx| at
7 T and 1.8 K is by a factor of 1.2, 4, and 130 larger
than in the previously studied f -electron based “giant”
Nernst eﬀect compounds PrFe4P12 [24], URu2Si2 [25],
and CeCoIn5 [26], respectively. At small magnetic ﬁelds

FIG. 2. (Color online) Temperature dependence of the Nernst
signal Nij and Nernst coeﬃcient ν = νij (inset) of CeNiSn for
three diﬀerent conﬁgurations, in magnetic ﬁelds up to 7 T.

B < 3 T the Nernst coeﬃcient of CeNiSn is essentially
ﬁeld independent for all directions. In the following dis-
cussion we concentrate on the 1 T data, which are in the
linear response regime.

Our most striking observation is that this giant Nernst
signal is practically isotropic, in contrast to the highly
anisotropic Hall response. It is even more isotropic than
the zero-ﬁeld electrical conductivity σii. This is seen from
Fig. 3 where we plot the ratio of the electrical conductiv-
ity along the (putative) nodal direction σzz to the arith-
metic mean of the conductivities in the plane perpendic-
ular to z, 1
2 (σxx + σyy), together with analoguous (linear
response) Hall and Nernst ratios 1
2 (σzy + σzx)/σyx and
Nzx/ 1

unity, whereas the conductivity and Hall conductivity ra-
tios reach much larger values of 4 and 18, respectively.

To understand this dichotomy, we now contrast a one-
band transport scenario with the nodal hybridization pic-
ture. In a one-band picture the severe Hall anisotropy
of CeNiSn, 1
2 (σzy + σzx) ≫ σyx, would conventionally
be understood as a result of Fermi surface curvature.
For example, a severely ﬂattened ellipsoidal Fermi sur-
face (Fig. 4 a) with the dispersion ( = 1)

Ek =

2m∗

gives rise to a reduction of order m/m∗ in the Fermi
velocity in the basal plane and, assuming an isotropic
scattering rate τk, a corresponding reduction of the mean
free path and the Hall conductivity in the basal plane.
By contrast, in a two-band picture, strong anisotropies of
the mean free path can be driven by anisotropies in the
hybridization. Suppose V (~k) ∼ V (kx ± iky) with a node
along the z-axis (Fig. 4 b). The corresponding dispersion
is given by

Ek =

ǫk + ǫf

Such hybridized bands are frequently evoked to provide a
simple understanding of heavy fermion metals and Kondo
insulators [27–30]. Here ǫk = ~k2/2m is the conduction
band dispersion and ǫf is the position of the f -level it hy-
bridizes with. In this second scenario, the anisotropy in
the quasiparticle velocities does not derive from the Fermi
surface curvature, but from the anisotropy in the hy-
bridization, even if the Fermi surface is spherical. Along

bridized two-band models of CeNiSn, showing the dispersion
(left), Fermi surface (center), and mean free path as a func-
tion of chemical potential (right).
In the one-band model,
the anisotropy in the mean free path reﬂects the anisotropy
in the dispersion along the z, x, and y directions, but in the
two-band model, the anisotropy is driven by nodes in the hy-
bridization along the z-axis. Both models give rise to mean
free path anisotropy but they diﬀer distinctly in the depen-
dence of this anisotropy on the position of the chemical poten-
tial. In the one-band model the mean free path anisotropy is
independent on the position of the chemical potential, while in
the two-band model, the anisotropy dependence on chemical
potential lies predominantly in the basal plane.

tron dispersion ǫk with the velocity vF = kF /m, whereas
within the basal plane the hybridization with the f -
state gives rise to a much smaller velocity v∗
F , where

kF (Supplemental Material).
Indeed,
Shubnikov–de Haas experiments indicate the presence of
very heavy quasiparticles as the ﬁeld is tilted towards
the z-axis [21]. Assuming again that τk is isotropic,
the velocity (or eﬀective mass) anisotropy then leads
to corresponding mean free path and Hall conductivity
anisotropies.

Thus, the curvature and hybridization induced mass
anisotropies can both give rise to the same Hall
anisotropies. We now demonstrate that the anisotropy
of the Nernst conductivity αxy distinguishes between the
two. According to the Mott formula, αxy is determined
by the energy derivative of the Hall conductivity

αxy = Q0T

(5)

∂σxy

∂E (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)EF

B

with Q0 = π2k2
3e . Combining this with the Ong formula
(1) we see that the Nernst conductivity is sensitive to
the energy dependence of the mean free path around the
Fermi surface. In the one-band picture, this anisotropy
is entirely determined by the Fermi surface curvature,
and thus the Hall and the Nernst signals share the same

anisotropy. By contrast, in the hybridization picture, the
energy dependence of the mean free path is distinct from
the Fermi surface curvature.

To understand this in more detail, it is useful to con-
sider the normalized ratio of the Nernst and Hall conduc-
tivities (Nernst-Hall ratio)

and an essentially isotropic Nernst conductivity.

In experiment, it is the Nernst coeﬃcient Nxy rather
than the Nernst conductivity αxy which is measured. In
this experiment Ez = ∇zT = 0. Using in addition ∇Ty ≈
0 and σ2
xy ≪ σxxσyy as estimated to be valid to better
than 10% for the data shown in Fig. 3, we obtain

where the integral over kz is the direction perpendicular
to the xy plane. Thus, D∗
xy is a measure of those regions
of the quasiparticle orbit in which the area swept out
by the mean free path is most sensitive to the chemical
potential.

In a one-band picture, changing the Fermi energy EF
does not aﬀect the aspect ratios of the Fermi surface. In
a simple relaxation time approximation the Fermi mo-
menta, velocities, and mean free paths are all propor-
tional to the square-root of the Fermi energy so that, as-
suming τk to be independent of energy, the logarithmic
derivative of the conductivity is given by

independent of the direction of measurement. In other
words, the anisotropies in densities of states and mean
free path compensate one another in all directions and
thus the Nernst-Hall ratio is isotropic. A strongly
anisotropic Hall conductivity, as observed for CeNiSn,
would thus be accompanied by a Nernst conductivity
with a qualitatively similar anisotropy, which is at odds
with our Nernst measurements on CeNiSn.

However, in the hybridized two-band picture, a change
in the Fermi energy produces a very large change in the
Fermi momentum of the heavy hybridized band in the
plane perpendicular to the nodal axis (Fig. 4 (b) right,
see Supplemental Material for details), but only a small
change in Fermi momentum in the unhybridized direction
along the z-axis.

In the Supplemental Material we show that in the re-
laxation time approximation, with an energy indepen-
dent τk, the ratio of Fermi energy to Kondo energy en-
ters in the expression for the Hall conductivity anisotropy
but drops out of the corresponding relation for the Nernst
conductivity, leading to the Nernst-Hall ratios

For CeNiSn we ﬁnd that, at 1 T, the ﬁrst term is negli-
gible below 8 K and thus

αyx ≈ σyyNyx

.

(12)

In addition, the Nernst ratio is close to 1, in particular
below 4 K, where it lies between 0.8 and 1.2. There-
fore, the ratio αzx/ 1
2 (αxy + αyx) follows the ratio of the
electrical conductivities at low temperatures (Fig. 3) and
reaches thus values of up to 4. Though less isotropic than
the Nernst signal itself, the Nernst conductivities are still
much less anisotropic than the Hall conductivities.

The dichotomy between an isotropic Nernst and a
strongly anisotropic Hall conductivity provides a valuable
signature of nodal hybridization in failed Kondo insula-
tors. One of the unsolved mysteries of Kondo insulators is
that all known true Kondo insulators are cubic, whereas
the putative nodal Kondo semimetals, including CeNiSn,
CeRhSb, and CeRu4Sn4 [31] develop a conducting pseu-
dogap. In the ongoing search for topological Kondo sys-
tems [6, 8, 9] it is important to understand why the depar-
ture from cubic behavior leads, seemingly innevitably, to
semimetallic behavior. One interesting possibility is that
these systems are related to nodal-line semimetals [32].
The Nernst-Hall dichotomy that we have discovered will
provide a useful way to conﬁrm nodal behavior in these
systems.

An extreme version of nodal semimetallic behavior
has been hypothesized to occur in the quantum critical
semimetal β-YbAlB4 [33–35]. In this system, the pres-
ence of a double vortex in the hybridization node is a ten-
tative explanation of the singular density of states that
develops under ambient pressure conditions. Measure-
ments of the Hall and Nernst anisotropies may provide
a way to conﬁrm the nodal hypothesis in this system in
future work.

In conclusion, we have measured the Nernst coeﬃcient
for the Kondo semimetal CeNiSn, showing that the di-
chotomy between the severely anisotropic Hall conduc-
tivity and the giant, yet isotropic Nernst signal can be
understood in terms of the nodal hybridization theory
of this system. One of the fascinating open questions is
whether the semimetallic behavior of CeNiSn is, in any
way, topologically protected by the crystal symmetries,
as in the case of Weyl semimetals. One of the unexplored
and interesting issues of this line of thought is whether
CeNiSn might possess novel surface states, an aspect that
has not been considered in our current analysis. We hope
that the Hall-Nernst dichotomy will provide a new im-
petus for experimental and theoretical work to address

these open questions.
