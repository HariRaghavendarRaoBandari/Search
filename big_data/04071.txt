Search for the Giant Pulses

Here we present results of our search for Giant Pulses(GPs) from pulsars of Northern Hemisphere.
Our survey was carried out at a frequency of 111 MHz using the Large Phased Array (LPA) radio
telescope. Up to now we have detected regular generation of strong pulses satisfying the criteria of
GPs from 2 pulsars: B1133+16, B1237+25.

1 Introduction

Slow pulse-to-pulse variation of intensity is very typical for overwhelming majority of known pulsars.

However, a handful of pulsars have mysterious mechanism which can break such a stability.

Phenomenon of generation GPs was ﬁrst detected for Crab pulsar(B0531+21) [1] and the millisecond
pulsar B1937+21 [2]. In following studies a set of typical characteristics of GPs was determined. These are:
very narrow components in pulse’s microstructure (up to several nanoseconds), high peak ﬂux density(up
to several MJy), and power-law distribution of the peak ﬂux density of GPs. It is important to emphasize,
that the pulsar B0531+21 and B1937+21 have very strong magnetic ﬁeld on the light cylinder (BLC ≈
106 G) and are considered as ”classical” pulsars with GPs. In course of time, GPs were detected from
5 pulsars with very strong magnetic ﬁeld on the light cylinder (BLC ≈ 105 − 106 G): B0218+42 [3],
B0540-69 [4], B1821-24 [5], J1823-3021 [6] and B1957+20 [3].

However, later on similar phenomenon was detected (mostly at low radio frequencies between 40 and
111 MHz) for set of pulsars with a value of BLC from several to several hundreds gauss: J0034-0721 [7],
J0529-6652 [8], J0659+1414 [9], J0953+0755 [10, 11], J1115+5030 [12] and J1752+2359 [13].

In present work we describe the results of our observations that were held to search for new pulsars

generating GPs or anomalous strong pulses at low radio frequencies.

2 Observations and Processing

The observations were made during 2012 and 2014 at the Pushchino Radio Astronomy Observatory
with the Large Phased Array radio telescope. This is the transit telescope with the eﬀective area of about
20000 ± 4000 m2 in the zenith direction. The main frequency of the observations was 111 MHz with a
bandwidth of 2.3 MHz(460×5 kHz channels digital receiver with post-detector DM (Dispersion Measure)
removal). The sampling interval was 1.2288 ms and the duration of each observation session was about
3.5 min (153 periods of PSR B1237+25).

We have processed the results of 66 observational sessions containing 11 091 pulses of B1133+16 and

89 observational sessions containing 13 617 pulses of B1237+25.

Average pulse of pulsar was obtained by summing and averaging of all individual pulses during one
session of pulsar’s observation. We have analyzed every pulse with a peak ﬂux density > 4σnoise and
located at the phase of the average pulse. Pulses with peak ﬂux density more than 30 peak ﬂux density
of the average (per session) pulse were marked as GPs candidates.

For PSR B1133+16 we calculated peak ﬂux density distribution separately for two main components

of the average pulse of pulsar.

3 Results and Conclusion

B1133+16 and B1237+25 are active second period (normal) radio pulsars with multicomponent
average pulses having two and ﬁve main components respectively. B1133+16 has a rotational period
P = 1.1879 s and BLC = 11.9 G, B1237+25 – P = 1.3824 s and BLC = 4.14 G. We have regularly
observed strong pulses from each pulsar during entire period of our observation [14, 15].
An example of GPs from B1237+25 and B1133+16 are shown in Fifure 1. The most powerful GP of
B1237+25 was detected on August 12, 2012, and have a ﬂux density of 900±130 Jy. There are around 12
GP events per 10000 pulses for B1237+25, and around 16 GP events per 10000 pulses for B1133+16.

The distribution of the peak ﬂux density (in signal to noise ratio units) in the Log-Log scale is shown in
Figure 2. For B1237+25 distribution of the strong pulses has a bimodal power-law shape with exponents
-1.26±0.05 and -3.36±0.34, which is quite typical of GPs and obviously diﬀers from log-normal individual
pulses distribution of regular pulses. The distribution for B1133+16 has a complex character and may be
ﬁtted as a combination of two log-normal distributions for the ﬁrst component of pulse and two log-normal
and one power-law components with an exponent -2.39 ± 0.08, for the second.

86, respectively.

Data was ﬁtted by the combination of two power-law distributions, and two log-normal plus power-law
distribution, respectively.

We can conclude that strong individual pulses of PSR B1133+16 and PSR B1237+25 observed at
111 MHz satisfy the main criteria of GPs. It worth noting that B1133+16 and PSR B1237+25 are pulsars
with low magnetic ﬁeld on light cylinder. This is the further conﬁrmation of our earlier assumptions that
such pulsars (including J0034-0721, J0529-6652, J0659+1414, J0953+0755, J1115+5030 and J1752+2359)
may be referred as a sub-class of pulsars with GP, having low magnetic ﬁeld on light cylinder and
generating GPs mostly at low radio frequencies.
