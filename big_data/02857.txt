formulas are obtained for some potential barrier models.

Key words: quantum mechanics, resonance, metastable state, unstable state, 1/N

A resonance in quantum mechanics originates from the coupling of a state in the discrete
spectrum to a continuum [1, 2, 3], such coupling generally increasing with the energy of
the resonance. As well known indeed, decay widths increase with the resonance energy,
the reason for that being kinematic: by increasing the energy, the available phase space
to the decay products becomes larger. The idea, roughly speaking, is to take advantage
of this fact to generate an expansion for high-energy resonances, which actually works also
for low-energy ones. Let us consider a Hamiltonian ˆH depending, for simplicity’s sake, on
a single coupling z,

ˆH = ˆH(z),

(1)

(3)

and possessing an inﬁnite tower of resonances ψn(z), n = 1, 2, 3, · · · going, in the free limit
z → 0, into the discrete spectrum of the limiting Hamiltonian

ˆH0 ≡ lim
z→0

ˆH(z).

(2)

As example of a free Hamiltonian, one may consider for example a particle in a box or a
harmonic oscillator. Conversely, we may consider a Hamiltonian ˆH0 possessing an inﬁnite
discrete spectrum {φn}, and add to it an interaction Hamiltonian involving a small coupling
z,

ˆH0 → ˆH(z) ≡ ˆH0 + ˆHI(z).

For a generic interaction, by switching on the coupling from z = 0 to z 6= 0 (|z| ≪ 1
always), the discrete states φn disappear from the spectrum and, according to the adiabatic
continuity principle [4], go one-to-one into long-lived resonance states. As we are going to
explicitly show in the following examples, an observable O related to the nth resonance, has
a general double series expansion of the form:

∞

k

O(n, z) = αn +

ck,lnlzk = αn + c0,0 + c1,1nz + c1,0z + c2,2n2z2 + c2,1nz2 + c2,0z2 + · · · ,

Xk=0

Xl=0

(4)
where α and ck, l are complex coeﬃcients. By collecting together all the terms with the
same power of z, one can rewrite the above formula as an ordinary series:

O(n, z) = α n +

∞

Xk=0

pk(n) zk,

where pk(n) is the polynomial in n of degree k,

pk(n) ≡

Xl=0

ck, l nl.

In the free limit at a ﬁxed resonance,

we obtain for the observable the free value:

z → 0,

ﬁxed n,

O(n, z = 0) = α n + c0,0 ,

whose ﬁrst term has been separated out of the above series. The standard perturbative
expansion involves the truncation of the series in z at some (ﬁnite) order, let’s say k = N,
together of course with the exact evaluation of the corresponding coeﬃcients:

O(n, z) ≃ α n +

N

Xk=0

pk(n) zk.

(9)

Let us notice that, in the limit speciﬁed in eq.(7), one is perturbing a free model, in which
resonances are stable, as there is no coupling of the latter with the continuum. Now, the
key observation is simply that, in eq.(4), each power k of the coupling z is multiplied by a
smaller or equal power l of the excitation number n,

Let us then assume we are interested in the study of a high-energy resonance,

nl zk :

0 ≤ l ≤ k < ∞.

in the weakly-interacting domain,

n ≫ 1,

0 < |z| ≪ 1,

such that the product of the above variables is of order one:

n z = O(1).

(10)

(11)

(12)

(13)

Because of the inequality (11), to a ﬁrst approximation, the double series in eq.(4) can be
replaced by a single series with the highest possible power of n for each power of z, i.e.
with l = k. Eq.(4) then simpliﬁes to:

O(n, z) ≈ α n +

∞

Xk=0

ck, k (nz)k = αn + c0,0 + c1,1nz + c2,2(nz)2 + c3,3(nz)3 + · · · .

(14)

In order for the above approximation to be sensible, one has to assume that the coeﬃcients
ck,l do not behave in a wild way with l: that is a priori possible, but it turns out to be false
a posteriori in all the examples (see later). The crucial point is however that the ”eﬀective
coupling” of the nth resonance ψn to the continuum, is actually n z, rather than z.
In
other words, not one, but two diﬀerent couplings are involved in resonance phenomena: a
state-independent coupling z, entering ˆH, and an eﬀective, state-dependent coupling nz,
which controls the actual size of the coupling of the nth resonance to the continuum. The
physical situation described above formally corresponds to the correlated limit:

n → ∞,

z → 0,

with the variable product approaching a non-zero constant:

n z → const 6= 0, ∞.

(15)

(16)

Let us stress that the limit (15-16) involves a delicate balance of eﬀects: If we send z → 0
without increasing n, metastable dynamics disappear from the model, because resonances

2

become stable states, i.e. eigenfunctions of ˆH. On the other side, if we send n → ∞ by
keeping z constant (and not zero), resonances become so wide as to loose some meaning and
their description becomes less accurate (see eq.(34)). The next step is to notice that eq.(14)
can be systematically improved, by thinking to its right-hand-side as the lowest-order term
of the following function series:

O(n, z) = α n +

∞

Xk=0

nk σk(ζ) = α n + σ0(ζ) +

σ1(ζ) +

n2 σ2(ζ) + · · · ,

where:

σk(ζ) ≡

∞

Xl=k

cl, l−k ζ l,

k ≥ 0.

(17)

(18)

We have deﬁned the nth resonance coupling as ζ ≡ n z. The following remarks are in
order. Eq.(17) is exact but, as it stands, is just a rearrangement of the z-expansion in
eq.(5). The general problem of analytic computations of resonances is that, apart from
exceptional cases, one is not able to exactly resum the series for O(n, z) in any form, so is
forced to use truncated formulas. In our new scheme, we then truncate the function series
above to some k = K < ∞:

O(n, z) ∼= α n +

K

Xk=0

nk σk(ζ).

(19)

As we will see later, this equation eﬀectively allows for simple analytic results in various
models. Roughly speaking, the idea of the 1/n-expansion is that eq.(19) provides a better
approximation to the exact theory than the standard perturbative expansion, eq.(9). To
begin with, the 1/n-expansion is obviously better, by construction, at least for high-energy
resonances. Because of eq.(10), any truncated expansion in z, at whatever order N, cannot
describe resonances with excitation number

n >

∼ ncr ≡

1
|z|

,

(20)

as |nz| >
∼ 1 in this case, implying that the neglected terms are of the same size as the com-
puted ones (|z| ≪ 1, z 6= 0 and ﬁxed: ”ﬁxed physics”). The critical value of the excitation
number, ncr = ncr(z), represents then an ”essential barrier” for ﬁxed-order perturbation
theory. In order to have a graphical representation of the z and the 1/n expansions, let us
consider a square plane lattice L, consisting of all points with positive integer coordinates
(see ﬁg.1),

L ≡ n(k, l); k, l = 0, 1, 2, 3, · · ·o.

(21)

We select the points p = (k, l) representing the terms ck, lzknl in eq.(4) lying, according to
this equation, below or on the top of the half-line m of equation l = k ≥ 0, namely the main
diagonal. Geometrically, these points p ﬁll the lower half H of L. Each perturbative order,
i.e. each power zs, corresponds to the vertical segment k = s, with 0 ≤ l ≤ s. The points
corresponding to σ0 lie instead on the main diagonal m. In general, each function σs(ζ)
corresponds to the half-line of equation l = k − s with k ≥ s, parallel to and below the main

3

diagonal m. By means of a (truncated) z-expansion, one then ﬁlls a triangle inside H with
one vertex at the origin, while with the 1/n expansion one ﬁlls a tilted inﬁnite strip inside
H, with the upper side on the diagonal m. In brief: with the perturbative expansion, one
sums the double series of the observable O(n, z) along vertical segments, while with the 1/n
expansion one sums along diagonals. Let us notice that at the lowest (non-trivial) order

Figure 1: The (big) points p = (k, l) with k = 0, 1, 2, 3, · · · and 0 ≤ l ≤ k on the lattice L
represent the terms zknl in the expansion of the observable O(n, z) (see text). The (dotted)
vertical segments represent the terms associated to some power of z. The (continuous) main
diagonal m, of equation l = k ≥ 0, contains the points corresponding to the resummed terms
in σ0. The two (dashed) half-lines parallel to m correspond to the functions σ1 and σ2.

in 1/n, we obtain a diﬀerent limiting model compared to the z-expansion, which we may
just call the ”n=∞ model”. This model already contains metastable states, described by
the leading-order function σ0(ζ). One is then perturbing this model by taking n large but
ﬁnite, obtaining corrections proportional to powers of 1/n, of the form σk(ζ)/nk according
to eq.(19). Contrary to the usual perturbative expansion in z in eq.(9), the 1/n-expansion
in eq.(19) involves an approximate resummation of the perturbative series to all orders,
as each term σk(ζ) involves the summation of inﬁnitely many terms in z. Therefore, in
this sense, we may say that a (truncated) 1/n expansion is non-perturbative in character
because, even though it is not exact, it allows to describe some phenomena which are
unreachable or invisible to a truncated expansion in z. It is clear that the expansions in z
and in 1/n of the same model have to be mutually consistent. That implies in particular
that, by expanding the σk(ζ)’s in powers of ζ, one should obtain the standard perturbative
expansion. On the contrary, by means of any truncated expansion in z, one is not able to
fully reconstruct anyone of the σk(ζ)’s. Generally speaking, one expects the 1/n-expansion
to be more diﬃcult to implement than the z-expansion, but at the same time to contain a
more rich dynamics.

For simplicity’s sake, in order to illustrate the method avoiding asymptotic expansions
of special functions, let us analyze some one-dimensional barrier models. We begin with
the so-called Winter model, describing a particle on the half-line x ≥ 0, subjected to a
potential spike at some point [5, 6, 8, 9, 10]. The Hamiltonian, after proper rescaling of

4

space, time and energy, reads:

ˆH = −

∂2
∂x2 −

1
πz

δ(x − π)

(22)

on the positive half line x ≥ 0 and with vanishing boundary conditions at the origin:
ψ(x = 0, t) = 0. We may also say that the model describes a particle contained inside
a cavity — the segment (0, π) in our conventions — with an impermeable wall at x = 0
and a permeable one at x = π. The model therefore implements the coupling of the box
eigenfunctions to a set of continuum states. In the free limit z → 0, the system decomposes
into two non-interacting subsystems [10]: (1) a particle in the box (0, π), with a discrete
spectrum only, composed of the eigenfunctions

r 2

π

sin(nx), n = 1, 2, 3, · · · , 0 < x < π;

(23)

(2) a particle on the half line (π, ∞), having eigenfunctions in the continuum spectrum
only, of the form:

r 2

π

sin(cid:2)k(x − π)(cid:3),

k > 0,

π < x < ∞.

(24)

As discussed in the Introduction, by switching on the coupling from z = 0 to z 6= 0, the
discrete spectrum above turns into an inﬁnite tower of resonant states, having wavefunctions
are of the form:1

ψn(x, t) = r 2

π

exp [−i En(z) t](cid:26)

sin [kn(z) x]

an(z) exp [i kn(z) x]

for 0 ≤ x ≤ π;
for π < x < ∞.

The outside amplitude has the explicit expression:

an(z) ≡

π z kn(z)

2πi z kn(z) + 1

.

The nth resonance has the complex energy En(z) = kn(z)2. The quantity

k = kn(z)

(25)

(26)

is the generalized, complex momentum of ψn and it is the only non-trivial quantity to
compute. In order to simplify the coeﬃcients of the equation determining the allowed k’s,
it is convenient to set:

For a ﬁxed coupling z (ﬁxed physics), the allowed w’s satisfy the implicit equation:

w ≡ 2πi k,

ew − zw − 1 = 0.

(27)

(28)

The transcendental character of the above equation in w is related to the fact that the
model has an inﬁnite tower of resonances, implying that it must admit an inﬁnite number

1 Due to the Gamow divergence [1], normalization is conventional (resonance wavefunctions are only

locally integrable: they are not even globally integrable in a weak sense).

of solutions: with an algebraic equation, one would obtain only ﬁnite-order multivaluedness.
The 1/n expansion is obtained by setting:

where n 6= 0 is an integer and the eﬀective coupling is deﬁned as:2

w = wn(z) ≡ 2πi n + σ(n, ζ)

ζ ≡ 2πi n z.

To generate a recursion in 1/n, eq.(28) is conveniently rewritten as:

σ = ln(cid:20)1 + ζ +

1

2πin

ζσ(cid:21) .

By formally expanding σ(n, ζ) in inverse powers of 2πin,

σ(n, ζ) =

∞

Xk=0

1

(2πin)k σk(ζ),

one obtains for the leading-order function:

σ0(ζ) = ln0 (1 + ζ) ,

(29)

(30)

(31)

(32)

(33)

where by ln0(z) we denote the principal branch of the complex logarithm of z 6= 0, i.e. the
one with −π < arg0(z) ≤ π. The leading-order (lo) decay rate reads:

Γlo

n (z) =

n
π

ln(cid:2)1 + (2πzn)2(cid:3) ,

(34)

where we have assumed z real (the physical case) and ln(x) is the real-analysis logarithm
of x. By expanding eq.(34) in powers of z, one obtains all the 1/n-leading contributions
to Γn(z), of the form n2l+1z2l, l ≥ 1. It is remarkable that the lowest-order perturbative
result Γn(z) ≈ n3z2 is converted, via the resummation implied by the 1/n-expansion, into
the large-n asymptotic behavior Γn(z) ≈ n ln (n|z|) [10]. Eq.(34) actually represents an
improvement of the leading result in eq.(244) of [10] (g ≡ −z). The ﬁrst few corrections
explicitly read:

σ1(ζ) = +

σ2(ζ) = −

(35)

(36)

The evaluation of higher-order terms is straightforward. By means of the simple third-
order expansion above, one already obtains an excellent approximation to wn(z), even for
small n: for z = −0.1, for example, our expansion gives for n = 1 a value of wn(z) with
a relative diﬀerence with respect the exact value of about 6 × 10−5, the error decreasing
down to 2 × 10−6 for n = 5. The reason for the convergence even at n = 1 may be that

2 The additional factor 2πi is inserted just for practical convenience.

the expansion parameter is actually 2πn, rather than n. As discussed in the Introduction,
since σ0(ζ) is a truly complex function, resonances already appear at lowest order in 1/n,
while in the standard perturbative treatment, resonances appear only at second order in z
[5, 6, 2, 8]. By expanding in powers of z the functions σ0(ζ), σ1(ζ) and σ2(ζ) above, one
explicitly obtains all the terms of the form (nz)l, z(nz)l, z2(nz)l, l ≥ 1 respectively.

As a more elaborate application of the 1/n-expansion, let us investigate the resonance
structure of a system consisting of a particle on the real line subjected to a double δ-potential
with general couplings z0 and z+. By a proper shift and rescaling of the x-coordinate, we
can assume the δ’s to be centered at x = 0 and at x = π, so that the Hamiltonian reads:

ˆH = −

∂2
∂x2 −

1
πz0

δ(x) −

1

πz+

δ(x − π).

(37)

Unlike previous case, the coordinate x has range in the entire real line in this model. We
may also say that the Hamiltonian in eq.(37) describes a particle in a cavity — the segment
(0, π) — with permeable walls on both sides, rather than just at one side as in the case of
the Winter model. The model therefore implements a coupling of the box eigenfunctions
to two sets of continuum states. By introducing w as in the previous case, the non-trivial
part of the evaluation of the nth resonance wavefunction involves again the evaluation of
this quantity, which satisﬁes in this case the equation:

ew − (1 + z0w) (1 + z+w) = 0,

(38)

The 1/n expansion is derived similarly to the case of the Winter model, so we report the
ﬁnal results only. In lowest order we ﬁnd:

and in next-to-leading order:

σ0 (ζ0, ζ+) = ln0(cid:2) (1 + ζ0) (1 + ζ+)(cid:3),

σ1 (ζ0, ζ+) = (cid:18) ζ0

1 + ζ0

+

ζ+

1 + ζ+(cid:19) ln0 [(1 + ζ0) (1 + ζ+)] ,

(39)

(40)

where ζi ≡ 2πinzi for i = 0, +. Let us observe that the leading function is, for real z0 and
z+, the sum of two Winter-model leading functions,

σ0 (ζ0, ζ+) = σ0 (ζ0) + σ0 (ζ+) ,

(41)

implying that the leading-order decay rate is the sum of the corresponding Winter model
contributions (see eq.(34)):

Γlo
n (z0, z+) = Γlo

n (z0) + Γlo

n (z+) .

(42)

The physical interpretation is that the amplitude inside the cavity ﬂows through each one
of the barriers, as if the other one was impermeable.

As a ﬁnal application of the 1/n expansion, let us consider the 3-δ model with general

couplings z−, z0 and z+ and equal spacing between them, described by the Hamiltonian:

ˆH = −

∂x2 −

with the coordinate x ranging in the real line. This model involves two cavities:
the
segments (−π, 0) and (0, π), and two continuum sets of states, describing a particle lying in
the half lines (−∞, −π) and (π, ∞). Each cavity is coupled to the other one for z0 6= 0, as
well as to the continuum states on the same side of the real axis for z−, z+ 6= 0. Resonance
wavevectors satisfy the transcendental equation:

where a, b and c are the following functions of z−, z0, z+ and w:

a e2w − b ew + c = 0,

a ≡ 1 − z0w;
c ≡ 1 + (z− + z0 + z+) w + (z−z0 + z−z+ + z0z+) w2 + z−z0z+w3.

b ≡ 2 + (z− + z+) w;

(44)

(45)

In eq.(44), powers of w up to the third one included are involved, each multiplied by a
symmetric polynomial in z−, z0 and z+ of the same degree. Unlike previous cases, where
only the exponential term ew was involved, two exponential terms, ew and e2w, are present
in this case; we will see later that this fact is the ”analytic source” of the degeneracy in the
resonance spectrum for z− = z+ in the limit z0 → 0. In order to generate the 1/n-expansion
in this case, the idea is to treat ew and e2w as unknown quantities, while treating the terms
containing powers of w as known quantities. By setting ξ = ew, with w = 2πin + σ±, we
obtain the implicit equation on σ±:

σ± = log0(cid:26) 2 + (2πin + σ±) [z+ + z− ± H (z−, z0, z+, σ±)]

2 [1 − (2πin + σ±)z0]

(cid:27) ,

(46)

where we have deﬁned:

H (cid:0)z−, z0, z+, σ±(cid:1) ≡ n (z+ − z−)2 + 4z2

0 h1 +(cid:0)2πin + σ±(cid:1) z+ih1 +(cid:0)2πin + σ±(cid:1) z−io1/2

.

(47)
For the determination of z1/2, let us take the principal branch, i.e. the one with −π <
arg(z) ≤ π. The equation above is solved recursively by setting as usual:

σ± (n; ζ−, ζ0, ζ+) =

∞

Xk=0

1

(2πin)k σ±

k (ζ−, ζ0, ζ+) ,

(48)

where ζi ≡ 2πinzi for i = −, 0, +. At the lowest order in 1/n, we obtain the rather compact
formula:

σ±

0 (ζ−, ζ0, ζ+) = log0(cid:20) 2 + ζ+ + ζ− ± ∆ (ζ−, ζ0, ζ+)

2(1 − ζ0)

(cid:21) ,

where:

∆ (ζ−, ζ0, ζ+) ≡ (cid:2) (ζ+ − ζ−)2 + 4 ζ0

2 (1 + ζ+)(1 + ζ−)(cid:3)1/2

By means of the Mathematica system [11], the next-to-leading-order correction is obtained:

(49)

(50)

.

σ±
1 (ζ−, ζ0, ζ+) =

N ± (ζ−, ζ0, ζ+)
D± (ζ−, ζ0, ζ+)

log0(cid:20) 2 + ζ+ + ζ− ± ∆ (ζ−, ζ0, ζ+)

2(1 − ζ0)

(cid:21) ,

(51)

8

where N ±, D± are the following algebraic functions:

N ± (ζ−, ζ0, ζ+) ≡ −2ζ 3

0 (ζ− + ζ+ + 2ζ−ζ+) + ζ 2

0 (4 + 6ζ− + 6ζ+ + 8ζ−ζ+) + (ζ− − ζ+)2 +
(52)

± (2ζ0 + ζ− + ζ+) ∆ (ζ−, ζ0, ζ+) ,

and

D± (ζ−, ζ0, ζ+) ≡ (1 − ζ0)h(ζ−−ζ+)2+4ζ0

2(1+ζ+)(1+ζ−)±(2+ζ−+ζ+)∆ (ζ−, ζ0, ζ+)i. (53)

As expected on the basis of physical intuition, eqs.(49) and (51) exhibit resonance degen-
eracy for ζ0 → 0 and ζ− = ζ+. The expressions above largely simplify in particular cases,
such as for example equal couplings of the side barriers, ζ− = ζ+, or small coupling of the
intermediate barrier, |ζ0| ≪ |ζ−|, |ζ+|. A plot of the resonance poles, in the next-to-leading
approximation speciﬁed by the σ±

same n (see text).

Let us conclude by saying that the calculation of resonant state parameters, such as
energy distributions, decay widths, branching ratios, etc., is of primary importance in
applications of non-relativistic quantum mechanics [2, 3]. This problem is generally treated,
apart from the simplest cases, with speciﬁc numerical methods [12]. We have presented in
this letter a general analytic expansion in 1/n for resonance states, where n = 1, 2, 3, · · ·
is the excitation number, which substantially simpliﬁes the relevant equations. In order to
avoid asymptotic expansions of special functions and obtain compact analytic formulas, we
applied the 1/n-expansion to some simple one-dimensional barrier systems, namely particles
subjected to δ-like potentials. Let us remark however that the expansion presented is quite
general and can be applied to any systems containing an inﬁnite tower of resonances. On the
mathematical side, the 1/n expansion can also be applied to solve transcendental equations
involving exponential and power functions of the unknown variable.

Expansions of similar form as the one presented in this paper are well known in statistical
physics and quantum ﬁeld theory [13], the main diﬀerence being that in the latter cases the

9

parameter n ≫ 1 denotes the number of components of a ﬁeld or the order of some symmetry
group, i.e. a state-independent quantity entering the Hamiltonian of the system. The idea
of an approximate, all-order, resummation of the perturbative series — as opposed to an
exact, ﬁxed-order, perturbative calculation — is basic in the studies of the current theory
of strong interactions, the so-called Quantum-Chromodynamics (QCD). In the latter case,
the role of our small quantity z is played by the coupling constant at a large momentum
transfer Q, αS(Q) ≪ 1, while the role of the large parameter n is played by the square of
a large logarithm L2 of infrared (soft and collinear) origin, or by a large logarithm L of
infrared or ultraviolet origin.

I would like to thank M. Bochicchio for discussions.
