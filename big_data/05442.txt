Abstract

The kinetic modeling and simulation of reactive ﬂows, especially for those with

detonation, are further investigated. From the theoretical side, a new set of

hydrodynamic equations are deduced, where the viscous stress tensor and heat

ﬂux are replaced by two non-equilibrium quantities that have been deﬁned in

our previous work. The two non-equilibrium quantities are referred to as Non-

Organized Momentum Flux (NOMF) and Non-Organized Energy Flux (NOEF),

respectively, here. The numerical results of viscous stress (heat ﬂux) have a

good agreement with those of NOMF (NOEF) near equilibrium state. Around

sharp interfaces, the values of NOMF (NOEF) deviate reasonably from those

of viscous stress (heat ﬂux). Based on this hydrodynamic model, the relations

between the two non-equilibrium quantities and entropy productions are es-

tablished. Based on the discrete Boltzmann model, four kinds of detonation

phenomena with diﬀerent reaction rates, including Negative Temperature Co-

eﬃcient (NTC) regime, are simulated and investigated. The diﬀerences of the

four kinds of detonations are studied from three aspects: hydrodynamic quan-

tities, non-equilibrium quantities and entropy productions. It is found that, the

eﬀects of NTC on hydrodynamic quantities are to lower the von-Neumann peaks

of density, pressure, and velocity, to broaden the reaction zone, and to subdue

the chemical reaction.

It may also vanish the peak of temperature. Conse-

quently, the eﬀects of NTC are to widen the non-equilibrium regions and reduce

the amplitude of the non-equilibrium eﬀects in the reaction zone. Besides, it is

also found that the (local) entropy production has three sources: the chemical

reaction, NOEF and NOMF. As for the global entropy production in the sys-

tem, the portion caused by reaction is much larger than the other two, and the

portion caused by NOMF is larger than that by NOEF. Furthermore, the eﬀect

of NTC is to widen the region with entropy production caused by reaction and

lower the global entropy productions caused by reaction, NOMF and NOEF,

which means that NTC drives detonation closer to an isentropic process.

Keywords: NTC, discrete Boltzmann model, detonation, non-equilibrium,

entropy production

1. Introduction

Detonation is a special case of combustion which is the major energy con-

version process and plays a dominant role in the transportation and power gen-

eration. It is a kind of chemical reaction phenomenon accompanied with violent

energy release [1–4]. The system with detonation can generally be regarded

as a kind of chemical reactive ﬂow. The controlled detonation has long been

extensively used in various engineering problems. Typical examples are referred

to Pulse Detonation Engine [5], Rotating Detonation Engine [6, 7], Oblique

Detonation ramjet-in-Tube [8], etc.

A detonation process may involve many species of reactants and a large

number of reactions. For example, the CH4/air detonation involves 53 kinds

of species and 325 reactions [9, 10] and n-heptane/air includes 2540 reversible

elementary reactions among 556 species [11]. The reaction rate generally varies

with the speciﬁc reaction. For a practical detonation, the varieties of reactant

species, shock strength, local temperature, speciﬁc volume, premixing homo-

2

geneity may guide the reactions into diﬀerent chains. Consequently, the ﬁnal

detonation process may show diﬀerent mechanical and thermodynamical be-

haviours according to the speciﬁc conditions. Therefore, the global reaction

rate may show non-monotonic dependence on the temperature, even though

the reaction rate shows exponential dependence on temperature in common

cases, just like what the Arrhenius model describes. In fact, the phenomena re-

lated to Negative Temperature Coeﬃcient (NTC) have been observed [11–14].

Physically, the occurrence of NTC may lead to signiﬁcant diﬀerent detonation

behaviours. To the authors’ knowledge, however, its possible eﬀects have not

obtained careful investigations.

It has been realized that various non-equilibrium behaviours extensively ex-

ist in the combustion and detonation phenomena [15]. But those complicated

behaviours and their possible eﬀects have far from been well studied. It has also

been well known that the traditional hydrodynamic modeling based on Euler or

Navier-Stokes (NS) equations is not enough to describe such complicated non-

equilibrium behaviours. The spatial-temporal scales that those complicated

non-equilibrium behaviours make eﬀects are much larger than those that the

molecular dynamics can access. Under such cases, to investigate the possible ef-

fects of the non-equilibrium behaviours, a kinetic model based on the Boltzmann

equation becomes preferable.

As a special discretization of the Boltzmann equation, the Lattice Boltzmann

Method (LBM) [16–20] has long been attempted to simulate combustion phe-

nomena [21–28]. The ﬁrst work was given by Succi, et al [21] in 1997. In those

previous studies, the LBM works as a kind of alternative numerical scheme. The

combustion systems are described by some kinds of hydrodynamic models.

To extend the LBM to model and simulate the detonation phenomena with

complicated non-equilibrium behaviours, at least two technical bottlenecks must

be broken through. The ﬁrst one is to extend its application range to the cases

where the Mach number is larger than 1. The second is that the improved

model must be some kinetic model which not only can recover, in the hydro-

dynamic limit, but also is beyond the traditional NS model. As was shown in

3

recent years, one solution to the ﬁrst bottleneck is to come back to the Finite-

Diﬀerence(FD) LBM [29].

In the FD-LBM, the discretization of the particle

velocity space is independent of the discretizations of the space and time. This

independence, together with the ﬂexibilities in choosing FD scheme and in dis-

cretizing the particle velocity space, makes it easier for the numerical system

to satisfy the von-Neumann stability condition in the cases with high Mach

number compressible ﬂows. The solution to the second bottleneck sees also sig-

niﬁcant progress in recent years. The LBM has been extended to investigate

various non-equilibrium behaviours in complex ﬂows [29–32]. Via such a model-

ing some new physical insights into the complex ﬂows have been obtained. The

observations have also been promoting the development of related methodology.

For example, the strength of the non-equilibrium increases in the spinodal de-

composition stage and decreases in the domain growth stage. Consequently, it

can work as a kind of physical criteria to discriminate the two stages [33]. Dif-

ferent kinds of interfaces, such as material interface and mechanical interface,

compressive wave and rarefactive wave, show diﬀerent speciﬁc non-equilibrium

properties. Consequently, the Thermodynamic Non-Equilibrium(TNE) can be

used to distinguish various interfaces [34]. The TNE behaviours in complex

ﬂows have also been used in interface-tracking scheme designs [35]. It has been

found that the viscosity (heat conductivity) decreases the local TNE but in-

creases global TNE around the detonation wave [36]. Such an extended lattice

Boltzmann kinetic model or discrete Boltzmann model (DBM) should follow

more strictly some necessary kinetic moment relations of the local equilibrium

distribution function f eq. In a recent study a double-distribution function DBM

was proposed, where one distribution function is used to describe the reactant,

the other distribution function is used to describe the reaction product [37].

This DBM corresponds to the so-called “two-ﬂuid” hydrodynamic model for

combustion.

Entropy production is a highly concerned quantity in both physics and en-

gineering studies. From the physics side, it is helpful for understanding the

complex non-equilibrium behaviours. From the engineering side, a process with

4

lower entropy production may have a higher energy transformation eﬃciency.

The objective of the present work is two-fold. Firstly, we further develop

the DBM to investigate various non-equilibrium behaviours in combustion, es-

pecially in detonation phenomena, aiming to establish a relation between the

TNE and the entropy production. Secondly, via a newly composed reaction

function, we investigate the possible inﬂuences of the NTC on the behaviour of

detonation in hydrodynamic quantities, TNE and entropy productions.

The organization of the present paper is as below. In section 2 we brieﬂy

review the DBM and the newly composed reaction rate function, present the

new form of ﬂuid hydrodynamic equations, and establish the relations between

TNE and entropy production. In section 3 we validate the model by simulating

two classical detonation benchmarks. In section 4, we simulate four kinds of

detonations with diﬀerent temperature dependent reaction rates, analyze the

diﬀerences of the four cases, and summarize the eﬀects of NTC on detonation.

Section 5 concludes the present paper.

2. Models and methods

2.1. Kinetic and Hydrodynamic models, non-equilibrium eﬀects and entropy pro-

duction

The kinetic model based on Boltzmann equation with chemical reaction has

a form as follows:

∂f
∂t

+ v · ∇f = Ω + C,

(1)

where f indicates the distribution function of particle velocity, v indicates the

particle velocity, t is temporal coordinate, Ω and C are the collision term and

chemical reaction term, respectively. The equilibrium distribution function of

velocity particle in Eq. (1) reads:

f eq = ρ(

1

2πT

)D/2(

1

2nπT

)1/2exp[−

(v − u)2

2T

−

η2
2nT

].

(2)

where D indicates spatial dimension, v and u are particle velocity and hydro-

dynamic velocity, respectively. η is a free parameter introduced to describe the

5

n extra degrees of freedom corresponding to molecular rotation and/or vibra-

tion [38]. The central moment M∗

2, M∗

3,1 and thermodynamic non-equilibrium

quantities ∆∗

2, ∆∗

3,1 are deﬁned as [39]

M∗

2(f ) = Z Z f (v − u)(v − u)dvdη,

M∗

3,1(f ) = Z Z f (v − u) · (v − u)(v − u)dvdη,

∆∗

2(f eq),

∆∗

3,1 = M∗

3,1(f ) − M∗

3,1(f eq).

(3)

(4)

(6)

Taking the velocity moment R R dvdη of the Eq. (1) gives the continuity

equation:

Taking the velocity moment R R vdvdη of the Eq.

conservation equation:

(1) gives the momentum

Taking the velocity moment R R ( v

∂t

+ ▽ · [ρu(e + T +

2

) + ∆∗

2 · u + ∆∗

3,1] = ρQF (λ).

(9)

Comparing with NS equations as shown in Eqs. (10a)-(10c) [40], we can conclude

that ∆∗

2 corresponds to the viscous stress tensor Π, and ∆∗

3,1 corresponds to the

heat ﬂux jq. Here we refer ∆∗

2 to as Non-Organized Momentum Fluxes (NOMF),

and refer ∆∗

3,1 to as Non-Organized Energy Fluxes (NOEF). The hydrodynamic

models, Eqs. (7)-(9), are derived from the Boltzmann equation, Eq.(1), with

the complete distribution function f . While, the common NS models , Eqs.

(10a)-(10b), are derived from the Boltzmann equation, with the approximation,

6

f ≈ f 0 + f 1, where the Knudsen number has been absorbed in f 1, f 0 is the

local thermodynamic equilibrium distribution function and f 1 is the ﬁrst-order

deviation of f from f 0. Consequently, the quantity, ∆∗

2 (∆∗

3,1), contains more

information than Π (jq) in NS equations. The numerical comparisons of Π and

∆∗

2, jq and ∆∗

3,1 are made in section 4.3.

∂ρ

(11)

(12)

where µ and κ′ are viscosity coeﬃcient and heat conductivity, respectively.

Following the way of deﬁning entropy equilibrium equation in the non-

equilibrium thermodynamics [41], replacing Π and jq with ∆∗

2 and ∆∗

3,1, re-

spectively, we get a new entropy equilibrium equation as follows:

∂s

(13)

where F (λ) indicates the reaction rate function that will be deﬁned later. In

fact, the ∂s

∂t can be written as

∂s
∂t

= − ▽ ·Js + σ.

(14)

The two terms on the right hand side of Eq. (14) are called entropy ﬂux and

entropy production, respectively. Comparing Eqs. (13) and (14) gives

Js = su +

(16)

From Eq. (16) it is clear that there are three source terms in entropy pro-

duction. The ﬁrst term is caused by NOEF, the second is caused by NOMF, and

the third is caused by chemical reaction. In the following sections, we will com-

pare the three portions of entropy production during detonation under diﬀerent

temperature-dependent reaction rates.

2.2. Discrete Boltzmann model

In 2013, an uniform scheme for composing single-relaxation-time and multiple-

relaxation-time DBM was proposed [38]. In this scheme the discrete local equi-
librium distribution function f eq
i

is inversely calculated from the kinetic mo-

ment relations it satisﬁes. Our studies in this work are based on a hybrid model

coupled by a DBM for high speed compressible ﬂows in Ref.

[38] and a phe-

nomenological reaction rate function [42].

Mathematically, the discrete model equations read

∂fi

else.

where subscript i indicates the i-th particle velocity, τ is the relaxation time,

t and rα are temporal and spatial coordinate, respectively. λ is a parameter

indicating the chemical reaction process, k indicates the reaction rate constant,

Tth is temperature threshold for chemical reaction. fi indicates the distribution
function of particle velocity and f ∗eq

indicates the local equilibrium distribution

function containing the eﬀect of chemical reaction, which reads

f ∗eq
i = f eq

i (ρ, u, e∗) = f eq

i (ρ, u, e + τ QF (λ)),

with

F (λ) =

dλ

.

8

(18)

(19)

where ρ, u, e are density, velocity, and internal energy, respectively. Q is the

amount of heat released by the chemical reactant per unit mass.

Here we consider the case where the time scale of thermodynamic relaxation

is much smaller than that of chemical reaction. So, the eﬀect of chemical reaction

is dynamically considered in the calculation of equilibrium distribution function.
The discrete velocity model adopted here (D2V16) and the method to solve f eq
i

are the same as in Ref. [38].

The impact of temperature on reaction rate is described by the dependence

of k on the temperature.

In fact, the dependence is non-monotonic [12] as

shown in Fig. 1. Figure 1(a) is for the most common case that k increases with

temperature. Figure 1(b) is for the explosion reaction. When the temperature

reaches a threshold value, the reaction rate increases drastically. Figure 1(c) is

for the enzymic catalytic reaction. Neither too high nor too low temperature

is of beneﬁt to the activity of enzymes which largely determines the reaction

rate. Figure 1(d) is for some kinds of reactions, such as the oxidation of large

hydrocarbons. The rise of temperature may has a signiﬁcant impact on the side

reaction inducing a more complicated reaction. Figure 1(e) is for the reaction

that k decreases with temperature, which is also a kind of NTC phenomenon 1.

An example for this case is the reaction: 2N O + O2 → 2N O2.

To describe the general relation between k and temperature (T ), a new

function k(T ) is constructed as follows:

k(T ) = a + bZ T

0

(t − T1)(t − T2)dt,

with

a = −

(20)

(21)

(22)

1It should be pointed out that, in many combustion references, Negative Temperature

Coeﬃcient (NTC) does not simply represent the fact that the reaction rate decreases with

temperature.

where h1 and h2 are the peak and valley values of k, respectively. T1 and T2

are temperatures corresponding to h1 and h2, respectively. Its schematic graph

is shown in Fig. 2.

To investigate the cases with diﬀerent kinds of temperature-dependent reac-

tion rates, we need only to adjust the parameters: h1, h2, T1, and T2, in such

a way that the temperature in reaction zone falls into a required range of the

curve shown in Fig. 2. In this paper, all the reactant components and the prod-

uct components are considered as only one kind. The total number of moles do

not change during the reaction. So λ can be denoted by the concentration of

the product. Considering the reaction is irreversible, λ = 0 at the beginning of

reaction and λ = 1 at the end of reaction.

3. Model Veriﬁcation

To demonstrate the validity of the new model, two typical benchmarks of

detonation are tested. The ﬁrst is the one-dimensional self sustainable sta-

ble detonation, and the second is the piston problem. The temporal partial

derivative in Eq.(17a) is solved by ﬁrst-order forward diﬀerence method, and

the spatial partial derivative is solved by NND scheme [43].

3.1. Self sustainable stable detonation

Consider a rigid tube which is full of premixed combustible gas. At a certain

time, a blast start from the left end of the tube. After a while, a self sustainable

stable detonation wave will be developed and formed. Initial condition is set as

follows:




(ρ, u, T, λ)L = (1.38837, 0.57735, 1.57856, 1),

(ρ, u, T, λ)R = (1, 0, 1, 0).

(23)

Here the subscripts L and R indicate the left and right side of the domain,

respectively. The left boundary is set as a static wall and the right is set to

be free ﬂow condition. Other parameters are ∆x = ∆y = 2 × 10−4, ∆t =

5 × 10−6, τ = 2 × 10−5, γ = 1.4, and the number of grid are Nx × Ny =

5000 × 1. Besides, the chemical reaction rate are described by Eq. (17b) and

it has k = 2 × 104, Tth=1.1, and Q = 1.0. At the time t = 0.35, the proﬁles

of hydrodynamic quantities around wave front are shown in Fig. 3(b). The

sound velocity surface behind detonation wave is shown in Fig. 3(a). The

corresponding values of macroscopic physical quantities in the surface can be

obtained from Fig. 3(b) and are shown in Table 1. In Fig. 3(a), the red solid

line indicates the propagation speed of detonation wave, and the black dotted

line indicates the sum of velocity of ﬂuid behind detonation and the local sound

velocity. The intersection of two lines is the position of sound velocity surface.

Table 1 shows the comparison of DBM simulation results and CJ theoretical

values. We can see that relative errors are all less than 0.38%, which shows that

the new model has a high accuracy in simulating one-dimensional detonation.

3.2. Piston problem

As shown in Fig.4, a detonation wave in rigid tube followed by a piston

whose velocity is speciﬁed. Due to the inﬂuence of the piston, there will be

three kinds of diﬀerent cases according to the relations between the speed of

piston and the ﬂuid velocity behind the detonation wave front:

1. up > ucj, where up is the speed of piston and ucj is propagation speed

of the wave front for CJ detonation. In this case, over-driven detonation

will be obtained. Fluid behind the detonation wave is accelerated by

piston and compressional waves generate continually until the velocity of

the ﬂuid reachs to up. Then there is a uniform zone between detonation

wave front and the piston. The speed of detonation wave is determined

by the speed of piston and the detonation energy is provided by both the

chemical reaction and the work of piston.

2. up = ucj. In this case, CJ detonation will be obtained. The ﬂow speed

behind detonation wave equals to the speed of piston, so the piston and

detonation wave keep relatively static. Behind the wave there is a uniform

zone, the macroscopic physical quantities of ﬂuid behind the wave and the

speed of the wave conform well with theoretical value of CJ detonation.

3. up < ucj. In this case, CJ detonation followed by rarefaction wave will be

obtained. Because the speed of piston is lower than that of ﬂuid behind

detonation wave, rarefaction wave develops from the surface of piston.

However, the disturbance of rarefaction behind the detonation wave can

not catch up with the wave front, so the speed of detonation wave remains

unchanged.

Initial condition set here is the same as those in Fig. 3. Top and bottom

boundary conditions are set to be periodic conditions. The left boundary is

piston with a constant speed up and the right boundary condition is set to be

free ﬂow condition. Other parameters are ∆x = ∆y = 2 × 10−4, ∆t = 5 × 10−6,

τ = 2 ×10−5, γ = 1.4, and the number of grid are Nx ×Ny = 5000 ×1. Chemical

reaction conditions are adopted the same as in Ref. [44]. Fig. 5 shows spatial

distribution of hydrodynamic quantities at the time t = 0.35. Figures 5(a)-(c)

correspond to up = 1.2, 0.57735, and 0.2, respectively. From Fig. 5 we can see

the basic characteristics of detonation including von-Neumann peak, reaction

area and rarefaction wave. Table 2 gives the value of macroscopic physical

quantities behind detonation wave, it is clear that the detonation type in the

case where up > ucj is over-driven detonation else it is CJ detonation.

From the simulation results, it is found that over-driven detonation, CJ det-

onation, and CJ detonation followed with a rarefaction wave area are obtained

when up > ucj, up = ucj, and up < ucj, respectively. From Fig. 5 and Table

2 we can conclude that the simulation results are well in accordance with the

4. Detonation phenomena under diﬀerent temperature-dependent re-

action rates

4.1. Four kinds of temperature dependent reaction rates

In this section, we simulate detonations in four kinds of cases: (i) the re-

action rate constant k keeps being a constant, (ii) k increases with increasing

temperature, (iii) k decreases with increasing temperature (i.e., NTC), and (iv)

k increases ﬁrstly and then decreases with increasing temperature. The four

kinds of cases are denoted by Case 1, Case 2, Case 3, and Case 4, respectively.

The parameters in Eqs. (20)-(22) are set as follows:

• Case 1: T1 = 1.1, T2 = 1.6, h1 = 2000, h2 = 2000;

• Case 2: T1 = 1.1, T2 = 1.6, h1 = 10, h2 = 2000;

• Case 3: T1 = 1.1, T2 = 1.6, h1 = 2000, h2 = 10;

• Case 4: T1 = 1.25, T2 = 1.6, h1 = 2000, h2 = 10.

The relations between k and T are shown in Fig. 6. We will study the diﬀerence

for the four cases from three aspects in the following section.

Case 1-Case 4, respectively.

4.2. Hydrodynamic quantities

The hydrodynamic quantities around detonation wave front are shown in

Fig. 7. It is found that the proﬁles for cases 1 and 2 are highly similar to each

other, and there is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in macroscopic physical quantities

between the two cases. The reason is that the reaction rate constant determined

by temperature for Case 2 approaches to the one for Case 1 in the reaction zone.

Besides, it can be found that there is little variation in temperature for Case

2 in the reaction zone from Fig. 7(d), so k reaches a stable level at k = 2000.

The reaction rate proﬁles for Case 1 and Case 2 can be seen from Fig. 7(f) and

they are almost identical.

From the proﬁles of ρ, ux, and P in Fig. 7(a), (b), (c), it can be seen that

there is a lower peak value and a wider wave structure for Case 3 and Case 4

than those for Case 1 and Case 2. The change is more obvious for Case 3 than

Case 4. In fact, Case 3 has a complete NTC while Case 4 contains a partial

NTC. So the characteristic in Case 4 should be somewhere in between Case

2 and Case 3. From the above analysis, it can be concluded that the role of

NTC is to lower the peak value and broaden the wave structure of ρ, ux, P . The

reason can be found in Fig. 7(e) and (f). From Fig. 7(e), it can be seen than

chemical time are much longer for case 3 and 4 than cases 1 and 2, and it also

can be seen that the distribution of reaction rates for cases 3 and 4 have a lower

amplitude and wider regions than cases 1 and 2 from Fig. 7(f). That is why

cases 3 and 4 has a wider wave structure. Further, a wider wave structure leads

a stronger rarefaction behind the detonation wave front, which is the reason

why the peaks of ρ, ux, and P are lower for cases 3 and 4 than cases 1 and 2.

From the proﬁles of T in Fig. 7(d), it can be seen that temperatures increase

rapidly at ﬁrst, then reach to a peak value and decrease toward a steady-state

value for cases 1 and 2. However, the temperatures rise slowly and have no peak

value during the whole process for cases 3 and 4. We can conclude that the role

of NTC is to smooth the variation in temperature and vanish the peak value of

T .

In our model, we assume that the chemical reaction will start as soon as

the temperature reaches a threshold value (Tth). It is possible for the chemical

reaction to start and consequently release heat in the shocking stage. Before the

19

von-Neumann peak, there are two kinds of mechanisms, shocking and reaction,

to increase the temperature. Behind the von-Neumann peak, the chemical re-

action is to increase the temperature, while the rarefaction eﬀect is to decrease

the temperature. The behaviour of the temperature is determined by the com-

petition of the two mechanisms. So, the temperature may show non-monotonic

behaviour.

For cases 1 and 2, the chemical reaction is very quick, it has nearly ﬁnished

around the von-Neumann pressure peak, consequently there is nearly no more

heat released after the von-Neumann pressure peak. That is the reason why we

observe a decrease of temperature. For case 3 or 4, the situation is signiﬁcantly

diﬀerent. The NTC makes the reaction more slowly. After the von-Neumann

pressure peak, the chemical reaction is still in process and the reaction heat

is still continuously added into the system. At the same time, the rarefaction

eﬀect here is weaker than in cases 1 and 2. Thus, we do not observe the decrease

of temperature in cases 3 and 4. For cases 3 and 4, the decrease of temperature

may result in a more violent detonation, as shown in Figs. 7(e)-(f), which is

responsible for that the temperature peak disappears for cases 3 and 4.

From the proﬁles of λ and dλ/dt in Fig. 7(e) and (f), it can be seen that

the chemical reactions complete in a very short time and the reactions are very

violent for case 1 and 2. However, for cases 3 and 4, the reaction zones have an

obvious extension and the reaction rate amplitudes is much lower than those for

cases 1 and 2. We can conclude that another role of NTC is to lower reaction

rate and prolong the reaction time.

Figure 8 shows the P-V diagram. From this ﬁgure we can see that detonation

process develop as follows: ﬁrstly, the pressure and density increase along the

Hugoniot curve with λ = 0 till the pressure and density reach to their peak

values, then they begin to make a transition from the peak values to their

stable state, i.e., CJ point which is in the Hugoniot curve with λ = 1, and

chemical reaction completes within the transition period. It can be found that

the four cases have similar P-V diagrams, but the peak value for Case 3 is lower

than Case 4, and they are both lower than those for cases 1 and 2. However,

20

the ﬁnal state behind the wave structure for the four cases are almost the same.

From the Rayleigh relation we can conclude that the speed of detonation wave

structure should be the same value for the four cases. So, it can be concluded

that the NTC lower the peak value of density and pressure but has no eﬀect on

the detonation process and the speed of wave structure.

4.3. Non-equilibrium eﬀects

Considering that all cases in this paper are for one-dimensional issues, only

the ∆∗

2,xx and ∆∗

3,1,x of non-equilibrium tensor, deﬁned in Eqs. (5) and (6) are

used in this section.

Firstly, the viscous stress (Πxx) and heat ﬂux (jq,x) are compared with the

non-equilibrium quantities, respectively, in Fig. 9(a) and (b). It can be seen

that, for the four cases Πxx are in accordance well with ∆∗

2,xx in the region where

the system are in or near equilibrium state, but there are observable deviations

between the two terms in the region where the system have signiﬁcant deviations

from equilibrium state. There are the same characteristics between jq,x and

∆∗

3,1,x.

In section 2, we have known that ∆∗

2,xx and ∆∗

3,1,x in the Eq. (8) and (9)

are derived directly from Boltzmann equation while Πxx and jq,x are derived

based on the approximation, f ≈ f 0 + f 1.

It is a reasonable approximation

when the system is near the equilibrium state, but it would be inaccurate when

the system deviates far from equilibrium sate. This means that NS may be

imperfect to describe detonation, especially in the region near the detonation

wave front where non-equlibrium eﬀect is remarkable.

The proﬁles of ∆∗

2,xx and ∆∗

3,1,x for four cases are shown together in Fig.

10. It can be seen that the amplitudes of ∆∗

2,xx and ∆∗

3,1,x in reaction zones for

cases 3 and 4 are lower than those for cases 1 and 2, and the non-equilibrium

regions for cases 3 and 4 are wider than those for cases 1 and 2. Furthermore,

the amplitudes of ∆∗

2,xx and ∆∗

3,1,x around the detonation wave front for cases

3 and 4 are also lower than those for cases 1 and 2. Because the deviation

from thermodynamical equilibrium state in reaction zone is mainly caused by

chemical reaction rate, while the NTC lower amplitude of the reaction rate and

extend the reaction zone. So the NTC lower the strength of non-equilibrium

eﬀect and wider the non-equilibrium zone.

The local entropy productions(σi, i = 1, 2, 3) and global entropy productions

(∆si, i = 1, 2, 3) of four cases are shown in Fig. 11 and Fig. 12, respectively.

From Fig. 11, it can be seen that there are two regions with entropy pro-

duction in the process of detonation. The ﬁrst one is in near the wavefront

where the entropy production mainly caused by NOEF (σ1) and NOMF (σ2),

while the second one happens in the chemical reaction zone where the entropy

production mainly caused by chemical reaction (σ3). The magnitude of σ2 is

higher than σ1 and they are both much lower than σ3. For cases 1 and 2, σ3

have concentrated distributions in reaction zone. While for cases 3 and 4, σ3

have relatively sparse distributions and the peak values are lower than those for

cases 1 and 2. Besides, this change for Case 3 is more obvious than Case 4.

The entropy productions, σ1 and σ2, for cases 3 and 4 are not obvious. From

Fig. 12, it can be seen that the global entropy production is mainly caused by

chemical reaction. It has the relation that ∆s3 >> ∆s2 > ∆s1. Because it

is a high-Mach propagation process for detonation, the role of NOMF is more

important than that of NOEF in entropy production. Besides, with the increas-

ing of Mach number, the entropy production caused by NOMF becomes more

remarkable. Comparing the four cases, we can see that the three global entropy

productions of Case 3 are all smaller than those of Case 4 and they both are

smaller than those of Case 1 and Case 2. As for the eﬀect of NTC on ∆s2 and

∆s1, because NTC reduces reaction rate and the intensity of reaction, lowers

24

the impact strength, drives the detonation to be closer to the isentropic process,

consequently it lowers the value of ∆s2 and ∆s1. While as for the eﬀect on ∆s3,

the detonation with NTC has a lower reaction rate which increases the extent

of quasi-static, so the value of ∆s3 is lower than in the cases without NTC.

5. Conclusions

To study the combustion system, both the kinetic and hydrodynamic models

are revisited. A new version of hydrodynamic model is presented. The relations

between non-equilibrium quantities and entropy productions are established.

Based on the DBM with a new reaction rate model, four kinds of detonations

with diﬀerent temperature-dependent reaction rates are simulated. The be-

haviours of the four cases are comparatively studied through three aspects:

hydrodynamic quantities, non-equilibrium eﬀects, and entropy productions.

From the side of hydrodynamic quantities, it is concluded that the role of

NTC is to lower the peak of density, pressure, and velocity in reaction zone, to

broaden the reaction zone, and to lower the instantaneous strength of reaction.

It may also vanish the peak of temperature. The reason is that reaction rate

determined by temperature in reaction zone is comparatively lower for the cases

containing NTC than those not. Besides, k would continue to decrease with the

rise of temperature, which results in a further decrease of reaction rate.

From the side of non-equilibrium, comparisons are made between viscous

stress and NOMF, heat ﬂux and NOEF. The numerical results of viscous stress

(heat ﬂux) have a good agreement with those of NOMF (NOEF) near equi-

librium state. Around sharp interfaces, the values of NOMF (NOEF) deviate

reasonably from those of viscous stress (heat ﬂux). Besides, the role of NTC is

to lower amplitude of non-equilibrium eﬀect and broaden the non-equilibrium

zone in reaction zone.

From the side of entropy production, it is found that the portion of global

entropy production caused by the reaction is much larger than those by NOMF

and NOEF. Entropy production caused by NOMF is much larger than that

25

caused by NOEF (i.e., σ2 > σ1 and ∆s2 > ∆s1). Besides, NTC deconcentrates

the distribution of entropy production caused by chemical reaction and lower

the global entropy productions caused by chemical reaction, NOMF and NOEF.

This means that detonation cases containing NTC are more likely to follow an

isentropic and quasi-static process.
