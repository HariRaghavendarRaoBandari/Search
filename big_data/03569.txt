AN INTEGRAL REPRESENTATION OF DILATIVELY STABLE

PROCESSES WITH INDEPENDENT INCREMENTS

THORSTEN BHATTI AND PETER KERN

Abstract. Dilative stability generalizes the property of selfsimilarity for inﬁnitely
divisible stochastic processes by introducing an additional scaling in the convolu-
tion exponent. Inspired by results of Iglói [6], we will show how dilatively stable
processes with independent increments can be represented by integrals with re-
spect to time-changed Lévy processes. Via a Lamperti-type transformation these
representations are shown to be closely connected to translatively stable processes
of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck-type, where translative stability generalizes the notion of
stationarity. The presented results complement corresponding representations for
selfsimilar processes with independent increments known from the literature.

1. Introduction

Many processes in physics and other sciences show certain space-time scaling prop-
erties for which the class of self-similar processes provides a natural tool in stochastic
modeling. For inﬁnitely divisible processes Iglói [6] introduced a more general scaling

property called dilative stability with an additional scaling in the convolution expo-
nent. We denote by ΨX
t1,...,tk the log-characteristic function or the Lévy exponent of
(Xt1, . . . , Xtk) for an inﬁnitely divisible process X = (Xt)t∈T, where T is either R
or R+ = [0, ∞) and t1, . . . , tk ∈ T, i.e. ΨX
t1,...,tk : Rk → C is the unique continuous
function with ΨX

t1,...,tk(0, . . . , 0) = 0 and

for all θ1, . . . , θk ∈ R. Following [1], the inﬁnitely divisible process X is called (α, δ)-
dilatively stable for some parameters α, δ ∈ R if

(1.1)

ΨX

T t1,...,T tk(θ1, . . . , θk) = T δΨX

t1,...,tk (T α− δ

2 θ1, . . . , T α− δ

2 θk)

holds for all T > 0, k ∈ N, t1, . . . , tk ∈ T and θ1, . . . , θk ∈ R.
It is immediately
clear that for δ = 0 and α > 0 an (α, δ)-dilatively stable process is α-selfsimilar. We

remark that the original deﬁnition of Iglói [6] is more restrictive (e.g., the process is
assumed to be non-Gaussian and to possess moments of arbitrary order) but we use

the more general approach from [1]. The class of dilatively stable processes contains
some interesting classes of processes that are not selfsimilar, see [6, 1] for details.

In particular, additionally assuming weak right-continuity of the inﬁnitely divisible
process X, dilative stability of X is equivalent to the notion of aggregate-similarity
introduced by Kaj [11], see Proposition 1.5 in [1]. From this point of view, dilatively

stable processes naturally appear as the class of limit processes in certain aggregation
models as shown in Theorem 3.1 of [12]. Examples of dilatively stable limit processes

in aggregation schemes appear in [11, 19], see section 3 in [1] for a detailed analysis.
In this paper we will restrict our considerations to additive processes (Xt)t∈T which

are deﬁned as in [21] by the following conditions:

(i) The process has independent increments, i.e. for any t0 < t1 < . . . < tn in T the
random variables Xt0, Xt1 − Xt0, Xt2 − Xt1, . . . , Xtn − Xtn−1 are independent.
(ii) The process is stochastically continuous, i.e. P {|Xs − Xt| > ε} → 0 as s →

t ∈ T for any ε > 0.

(iii) The process has càdlàg paths, i.e. almost surely the mapping t 7→ Xt is right-

continuous with left limits.

(iv) X0 = 0 almost surely.

It is well known that additive selfsimilar processes are closely connected to selfde-

composable random variables and thus can be represented as integrals with respect
to a Lévy process; cf. Wolfe [22, 23], Jurek and Vervaat [8, 10] and Sato [20].
In

order that the random integrals do properly exist, the Lévy process necessarily must
have a ﬁnite logarithmic moment. Certain extensions of the integral representation

for additive operator-selfsimilar and semi-selfsimilar processes are given in [7] and
[2, 15], respectively. Further, the Lamperti transform [14] gives a well known cor-

respondence between selfsimilar processes and stationary processes. The latter are

INTEGRAL REPRESENTATION OF DILATIVELY STABLE PROCESSES

stationary Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes in case of additive selfsimilar processes

and the integral representation of an additive selfsimilar process is directly related to
the integral representation of the corresponding OU-process.

Our aim is to generalize the above mentioned integral representations and con-

nections for the larger class of additive dilatively stable processes in Section 2. As
already laid out in sections 2.5 and 2.6 of Iglói [6], these are integrals with respect

to certain time-changed Lévy processes. Since Iglói [6] requires ﬁnite moments of
arbitrary order, for our less restrictive deﬁnition (1.1) of dilative stability we are par-

ticularly interested in deriving appropriate moment conditions for the driving Lévy
processes. In case α = δ/2 it will turn out that there is also a connection to additive
quasi-selfsimilar processes introduced by Maejima and Ueda [17]; see Remark 2.6.

A certain generalization of the Lamperti transform directly relates dilatively sta-
ble processes to so-called translatively stable processes. The deﬁnition of the latter

processes also goes back to Iglói [6] and is directly connected to processes which are
inﬁnitely divisible in time and to time-stable processes as introduced by Mansuy [18],

respectively Kopp and Molchanov [13]. We will lay out this connection in Section
3 and, inspired by Iglói [6], we will further show how our integral representation of

additive dilatively stable processes from Section 2 is related to certain translatively
stable processes of OU-type via a Lamperti-type transformation.

2. Random Integral representation

We use the following construction of random integrals as almost surely pathwise

limits of Riemann-Stieltjes sums which goes back to Wolfe [22, 23] or Jurek and
Vervaat [8, 10], cf. also Lemma 2.1 in [2]. Let Y = (Yt)t∈T be an additive process on
R and let A : T → R be continuously diﬀerentiable. Then for any a < b < ∞ and any
sequence of partitions a = t(n)
n = b of [a, b] ⊆ T
with max1≤j≤n(t(n)

1 ≤ s(n)
j−1) → 0 as n → ∞ we have

2 < . . . ≤ s(n)

where the integral exists pathwise as a Riemann integral and the exceptional nullset

does not depend on the particular choice of partitions. Now we are able to deﬁne a

where we deﬁne s(n)
n+1 := b. In this context the additive process Y is

called the background driving process. We will frequently make use of the following

change of variables formula which is an easy consequence of the random integral
construction. For a continuous non-increasing or non-decreasing function γ : T → R
and [a, b] ⊆ T we have

where in case γ(b) < γ(a) the random integral on the right-hand side is deﬁned by

Our background driving process Y itself will be deﬁned by random integrals of the

following kind.

Lemma 2.1. Let X = (Xt)t≥0 be an additive process. Then the process Y = (Yt)t∈R
given by

for t < 0

Proof. By the deﬁnition of the random integral, (Yt)t∈R has independent increments
because (Xt)t≥0 has and its paths are almost surely càdlàg functions. Of course
Y (0) = 0. It remains to check that (Yt)t∈R is stochastically continuous. For s, t ∈ R
we have

Yt − Ys = e−t(α−δ/2)Xet − e−s(α−δ/2)Xes +Z et

where e−t(α−δ/2)Xet − e−s(α−δ/2)Xes → 0 in probability as s → t, since (Xt)≥0 is
stochastically continuous, and the integral converges to zero almost surely as s → t,

since the integrand is almost surely bounded on compact sets; see [9, p.114].

(cid:3)

This directly enables us to obtain a random integral representation for additive

dilatively stable processes.

Theorem 2.2. Let (Xt)t≥0 be an additive (α, δ)-dilatively stable process and (Yt)t∈R
be the corresponding process given in Lemma 2.1. Then for any t > 0 we have

By stochastic continuity Xt − Xs → Xt − X0 = Xt in probability as s ↓ 0. Since
the process X has independent increments, convergence in probability is equivalent

to almost sure convergence by Theorem A2.2 in [10].

We will now show that the backround driving process (Yt)t∈R is a time-transformed

Lévy process. Preparatory, we will investigate its increments.

Lemma 2.3. For ﬁxed T ∈ R let (Kt;T )t∈R := (Yt+T − YT )t∈R, where Y is the process
from Lemma 2.1 with an additive (α, δ)-dilatively stable process X. In terms of the
Lévy exponent this process fulﬁlls

Proof. Let us ﬁrst prove that ΨK

Let Y be an inﬁnitely divisible random variable. We say that (L(t))t∈R is the

two-sided Lévy process generated by the law of Y if it can be represented as

L(t) =(L(1)(t)

−L(2)((−t)−)

if t ≥ 0
if t < 0

with independent copies (L(1)(t))t≥0, (L(2)(t))t≥0 of the Lévy process generated by the
law of Y . Note that (L(t))t∈R has càdlàg paths.

Lemma 2.4. Let X = (Xt)t≥0 be an additive (α, δ)-dilatively stable process. Then the
background driving process Y = (Yt)t∈R from Lemma 2.1 is the time-changed process

(Yt)t∈R

d=(cid:0)L( eδt−1

8

THORSTEN BHATTI AND PETER KERN

where (L(t))t∈R is the two-sided Lévy process generated by the law of Y1 and d= denotes
equality in distribution. Note that for δ = 0 the time-change function is simply deﬁned

by limδ→0(cid:0)(eδt − 1)/(eδ − 1)(cid:1) = t.

Proof. In case δ = 0 the process X is a selfsimilar additive process and it is well

known that the corresponding background driving process is a Lévy process. Thus
we will only prove the case δ 6= 0. For N ∈ N and n = 0, . . . , N − 1, setting T = nt

in Lemma 2.3 we get for any t ∈ R

for all k ∈ N and t1, . . . , tk, θ1, . . . , θk ∈ R. It suﬃces to prove the assertion for k = 2

Nevertheless, Maejima and Ueda [17] provide an integral representation in case

α = δ/2 as follows. Writing α = −γ/2 and hence δ = −γ for γ ∈ R, an ad-
ditive (−γ/2, −γ)-dilatively stable process (Xt)t≥0 is γ-quasi-selfsimilar, which by
Deﬁnition 1.3 in [17] means that the Lévy exponent fulﬁlls

ΨX

T t(θ) = T −γΨX

t (T θ)

for all t ≥ 0, T > 0, θ ∈ R.

This has the following interesting consequence. If γ < 0 then by Theorem 2.2(II)(i) in
[17] the Lamperti-type transform (Zt = (1 − γt)1/γX(1−γt)−1/γ )t≥0 is a γ-mild OU-type
process, which by Deﬁnition 1.2(i) in [17] means that

Zt = (1 − γt)1/γZ t

1/γ

(1 − γu)−1/γ Y (du),

where Y denotes an independently scattered random measure. In conclusion we get

γ (1+t−γ )

Xt =Z 1

1/γ

(1 − γu)−1/γ Y (du) =Z log t

−∞

eu Y (dϕ(u)),

where the last equality applies by formal change of variables ϕ(log t) = 1
γ (1 + t−γ).
Similar representations hold for 0 < γ < 2 by Theorem 2.2(II) together with Def-

inition 1.2 in [17] if certain moment conditions on Y are fulﬁlled. Note that by
Theorem 2.3(II) in [17] a further connection between γ-quasi-selfsimilar processes

and γ-selfdecomposable random variables is outlined. The latter fulﬁll an integral
representation by [16].

For α 6= δ/2 we will investigate a Lamperti-type transformation of dilatively stable

processes and its connection to OU-type processes in Section 3.

We now turn to the converse relation of constructing additive dilatively stable pro-
cesses as random integrals with respect to a time-changed Lévy process. As mentioned
in the Introduction, for additive selfsimilar processes (case δ = 0) the driving Lévy

process must have a ﬁnite logarithmic moment. Since the desired converse relation
for additive selfsimilar processes is already fully established in the mathematical liter-

ature, we concentrate on the case δ 6= 0. For δ < 0 we will need the following moment
condition for which we were not able to ﬁnd a suitable reference.

eδ − 1(cid:17) d= L(cid:16)eδT eδt − 1

by Corollary A2.3 in [10] is equivalent to the asserted almost sure convergence. (cid:3)

thus X = (Xt)t≥0 is well-deﬁned. Similar to the proof of Lemma 2.1 one can show
that X is an additive process. It remains to show that X is (α, δ)-dilatively stable.

t

(2.14) converges absolutely almost surely, then Lemma 2.7 applied to a = 2, b = 1

assure the almost sure convergence of the integral in (2.13) for arbitrary sequences
decreasing to −∞ in Theorem 2.10, we asserted the stronger moment condition (2.8)
of order γ > −δ
α+δ/2 > 1/β which can get arbirary large for α ↓ −δ/2. We were not
able to derive a precise moment condition which is necessary and suﬃcient for the

existence of the integral in (2.13) in an almost sure sense.

3. Translatively stable processes

In this section we restate Iglói’s [6] notion of translative stability, a generalization
of stationarity for stochastic processes. Similar to stationary processes, a Lamperti-

type transformation provides a close connection to dilatively stable processes already
laid out in [6]. Specifying this connection to the subclass of additive dilatively stable
processes, we can relate our results from Section 2 to an integral representation for

certain translatively stable processes of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type.

Deﬁnition 3.1. An inﬁnitely divisible process (Vt)t∈R is called δ-translatively stable
if for some δ ∈ R in terms of the Lévy exponent we have

ΨV

t1+T,...,tk+T (θ1, . . . , θk) = eδT ΨV

t1,...,tk (θ1, . . . , θk)

for all T ∈ R, t1, . . . , tk ∈ R, θ1, . . . , θk ∈ R .

Note that for δ = 0 this deﬁnition coincides with stationarity. There appears a
related scaling relation in the literature called δ-time stability by Kopp and Molchanov

[13]. The deﬁnition of this scaling relation goes back to Mansuy’s [18] concept of
inﬁnite divisibility with respect to time and was further investigated in [4, 5]. We will

ﬁrst state these concepts in our context of characteristic functions to compare them
to translatively stable processes.

A real-valued process (Dt)t≥0, is said to be inﬁnitely divisible with respect to time

(IDT) if for any n ∈ N we have

(3.1)

ΨD

nt1,...,ntk(θ1, . . . , θk) = n · ΨD

t1,...,tk (θ1, . . . , θk)

for all t1, . . . , tk ≥ 0 and θ1, . . . , θk ∈ R . A stochastically continuous process (Zt)t≥0
is called δ-time stable for some δ 6= 0 if for any n ∈ N we have

(3.2)

ΨZ

n1/δt1,...,n1/δtk

(θ1, . . . , θk) = n · ΨZ

t1,...,tk(θ1, . . . , θk)

for all t1, . . . , tk ≥ 0 and θ1, . . . , θk ∈ R. As a direct consequence from (3.1), respec-
tively (3.2) we immediately get D0 = 0 and Z0 = 0 almost surely.

We will now show that these concepts are closely related to translative stability
and thus examples of IDT, respectively δ-time stable processes given in [4, 5, 13, 18]

may also serve as examples of δ-translatively stable processes.

INTEGRAL REPRESENTATION OF DILATIVELY STABLE PROCESSES

Lemma 3.2. Let δ 6= 0.

(a) If (Vt)t∈R is stochastically continuous and δ-translatively stable with Vt → 0 in
probability as t ↓ −∞ then (Zt := Vlog t)t≥0 is δ-time-stable. Conversely, if (Zt)t≥0 is
a δ-time-stable process then (Vt := Zet)t∈R is δ-translatively stable.

(b) If (Vt)t∈R is δ-translatively stable then (Dt := V1/δ log t)t≥0 is IDT. Conversely, if
(Dt)t≥0 is IDT and all its ﬁnite-dimensional distributions are weakly right-continuous
then (Vt := Deδt)t∈R is δ-translatively stable.

Proof. (a) For n ∈ N let T = 1
t1, . . . , tk ≥ 0 the Lévy exponent of (Zt = Vlog t)t≥0 fulﬁlls

Rewriting S = eδT for T ∈ R this shows that (Vt := Zet)t∈R is δ-translatively stable.
(b) Setting V−∞ = 0 = V∞ we can show that (Dt := V1/δ log t)t≥0 is IDT similar to
part (a). For the converse relation our assumption on weak right-continuity guaran-

stable.

As mentioned above, a Lamperti-type transformation connects the class of dila-
In the special case of a

tively stable and translatively stable processes as follows.

convolution exponent δ = 0, the classical Lamperti transform [14] is known to build
a one-to-one correspondence between self-similar processes and stationary processes

on the real line. We use the following generalization of the Lamperti transform due
to Iglói [6].

Deﬁnition 3.3. Let (Xt)t>0 be a real-valued stochastic process and α, δ ∈ R. We
call the stochastic process

V = (Vt := e−(α−δ/2)tXet)t∈R

20

the Lamperti-type transform of (Xt)t>0. Its inverse on the path space given by

X = (Xt := tα−δ/2Vlog t)t>0

is called the inverse Lamperti-type transform of (Vt)t∈R.

Proposition 3.4. (a) If (Xt)t≥0 is (α, δ)-dilatively stable for some α, δ ∈ R then its
Lamperti-type transform (Vt = e−(α−δ/2)tXet)t∈R is δ-translatively stable.

(b) If (Vt)t∈R is δ-translatively stable for some δ ∈ R then with X0 := 0 its inverse
Lamperti-type transform (Xt = tα−δ/2Vlog t)t≥0 is (α, δ)-dilatively stable for any α ∈ R.

Proof. The proof is a straightforward calculation using the scaling properties of

translatively and dilatively stable processes.

(a) For T ∈ R, t1, . . . , tk ∈ R and θ1, . . . , θk ∈ R we get

Further we can show that there is a close connection between additive dilatively

stable processes and translatively stable wide-sense Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type (OU-
type) processes as introduced in Maejima and Sato [15].

Deﬁnition 3.5. Let (Yt)t∈R be an additive process. A stochastic process (Ut)t∈R is
called wide-sense OU-type process with parameter λ ∈ R and background driving

process (Yt)t∈R if

(3.3)

e−λsdYs(cid:19) for all t ∈ R.

Proposition 3.6. (a) Let (Xt)t≥0 be an additive (α, δ)-dilatively stable process for
some α, δ ∈ R. Then its Lamperti-type transform (Vt = e−(α−δ/2)tXet)t∈R is a δ-
translatively stable wide-sense OU-type process with parameter λ = δ/2−α and driving
process (Yt)t∈R as in Lemma 2.1.

(b) For some α, δ ∈ R let (Vt)t∈R be a δ-translatively stable wide-sense OU-type
process with parameter λ = δ/2 − α and driving process (Yt = (L( eδt−1
eδ−1 ))t∈R, where
(L(t))t∈R is a two-sided Lévy process. If e(α−δ/2)tVt → 0 in probability as t ↓ −∞
then the inverse Lamperti-type transform (Xt = tα−δ/2Vlog t)t≥0 is an additive (α, δ)-
dilatively stable process.

Proof. (a) By Proposition 3.4(a) the process (Vt)t∈R is δ-translatively stable and by
Theorem 2.2 we have

eλt(cid:18)V0 +Z t

0

e−λu dYu(cid:19) = e−(α−δ/2)t(cid:0)X1 + (Xet − X1) = e−(α−δ/2)tXet = Vt

showing that (Vt)t∈R is a wide-sense OU-type process as asserted.

(b) By Proposition 3.4(b) the process (Xt)t≥0 is (α, δ)-dilatively stable with Xt →

0 =: X0 in probability as t ↓ 0 by assumption. For 0 < s < t we observe by (3.3)

Xt − Xs = tα−δ/2Vlog t − sα−δ/2Vlog s =Z log t

log s

e(α−δ/2)udL( eδu−1
eδ−1 )

showing that (Xt)t≥0 has independent increments, is stochastically continuous and
has càdlàg paths.
(cid:3)

Combining Proposition 3.6 with the results of Section 2 we can directly state an

integral representation for translatively stable wide-sense OU-type processes.

Corollary 3.7. (a) For some α, δ ∈ R let (Vt)t∈R be a δ-translatively stable wide-sense
OU-type process with parameter λ = δ/2 − α and driving process (Yt = (L( eδt−1
eδ−1 ))t∈R,
where (L(t))t∈R is a two-sided Lévy process. If e(α−δ/2)tVt → 0 in probability as t ↓ −∞
then (Vt)t∈R has the integral representation

Vt =Z t

−∞

e(u−t)(α−δ/2)dYu.

(b) For δ 6= 0 let (L(t))t∈R be a two-sided Lévy process and (Yt)t∈R = (L( eδt−1

eδ−1 ))t∈R
be the time-changed Lévy process such that for some α ∈ R one of the conditions (a)
or (b) in Lemma 2.9 is fullﬁlled. Then the process (Vt)t∈R given by

Vt :=Z t

−∞

e(u−t)(α−δ/2)dYu

is well-deﬁned and a δ-translatively stable wide-sense OU-type process with parameter
λ = δ/2 − α and driving process (Yt)t∈R.

Proof. Part (a) follows directly from Proposition 3.6(b) and Theorem 2.2, whereas

part (b) is a direct consequence of Theorem 2.10 together with Proposition 3.6(a). (cid:3)
