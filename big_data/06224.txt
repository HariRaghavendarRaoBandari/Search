ABSTRACT
Kuiper Belt objects with absolute magnitude less than 3 (radius &500 km), the dwarf
planets, have a range of diﬀerent ice/rock ratios, and are more rock-rich than their
smaller counterparts. Many of these objects have moons, which suggests that colli-
sions may have played a role in modifying their compositions. We show that the dwarf
planets fall into two categories when analysed by their mean densities and satellite-to-
primary size ratio. Systems with large moons, such as Pluto/Charon and Orcus/Vanth,
can form in low-velocity grazing collisions in which both bodies retain their composi-
tions. We propose that these systems retain a primordial composition, with a density
of about 1.8 g/cm3. Triton, thought to be a captured KBO, could have lost enough
ice during its early orbital evolution to explain its rock-enrichment relative to the pri-
mordial material. Systems with small moons, Eris, Haumea, and Quaoar, formed from
a diﬀerent type of collision in which icy material, perhaps a few tens of percent of the
total colliding mass, is lost. The fragments would not remain in physical or dynamical
proximity to the parent body. The ice loss process has not yet been demonstrated
numerically, which could be due to the paucity of KBO origin simulations, or missing
physical processes in the impact models. If our hypothesis is correct, we predict that
large KBOs with small moons should be denser than the primordial material, and that
the mean density of Orcus should be close to the primordial value.

1 INTRODUCTION

The Kuiper belt is composed of icy building blocks left
over after the era of planet formation beyond the orbit
of Neptune. The distant dwarf planets, Kuiper belt ob-
jects with absolute magnitude less than 3 (radii & 500
km), represent the largest products of planetesimal ac-
cretion in the outer Solar System, with the vast major-
ity of Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) being much smaller in
size. Wide-ﬁeld surveys (Millis et al. 2002; Trujillo & Brown
2003; Elliot et al. 2005; Jones et al. 2006; Larsen et al.
2007; Brown 2008; Petit et al. 2011; Schwamb et al. 2010;
Sheppard et al. 2011; Rabinowitz et al. 2012; Brown et al.
2015; Bannister et al. 2015) have completed the inventory
of distant dwarf planets brighter than ∼21.5th apparent R
magnitude (Schwamb et al. 2013; Brown et al. 2015), yield-

ing seven bodies comparable in size to Pluto: Makemake,
Haumea, Eris, Sedna, 2007 OR10, Quaoar, and Orcus. These
objects are bright enough to be studied with the current
suite of large ground-based and space-based telescopes. Ob-
servations of their sizes, masses, and compositions can pro-
vide a window into the early environment of the outer Solar
System and planet formation processes (e.g., Brown 2008,
2012, and references therein).

Adaptive optics observations with ground-based 8-10-
m class telescopes and imaging from the Hubble Space
Telescope have revealed that the majority of the dwarf
planets have satellites, and that satellites are more com-
mon in the dwarf planet population than in other size
classes (Brown et al. 2006). A moon’s orbit about its pri-
mary and knowledge of the primary’s size allow an estimate
of density. The densities of the dwarf planets with moons
range from ∼1.6 g/cm3 to 2.6 g/cm3 (Tholen et al. 2008;
Brown et al. 2010; Lellouch et al. 2010; Sicardy et al. 2011;

2

Barr and Schwamb

Braga-Ribas et al. 2013; Lockwood et al. 2014; Stern et al.
2015), suggesting that some are more rock-rich than oth-
ers. The data reveal no clear correlation between size
and density (Brown 2008), and a number of oddities, no-
tably, Eris, which is 27% more massive than Pluto, despite
having a nearly identical radius (Brown & Schaller 2007;
Sicardy et al. 2011).

In the past six years, improvements in the predictions of
stellar occultations, and New Horizons images of the Pluto
system, have provided updated information about the sizes
and densities of the dwarf planets. The radii derived from
these methods have uncertainties of a few kilometres, in con-
trast to the much larger measurement errors from optical
and infrared observations. Images of Pluto from the New
Horizons ﬂyby in July 2015 have yielded an extremely accu-
rate measurement of Pluto’s physical size, separate from its
atmosphere (Stern et al. 2015). Before the encounter, the
best estimates of the densities of Pluto and Charon were
¯ρ = 2.06 g/cm3 and ¯ρ = 1.63 g/cm3 (Tholen et al. 2008).
Post-encounter densities for the two bodies diﬀer by only
10% (Stern et al. 2015), and the value of Pluto’s density has
been lowered to 1.86 ±0.01 g/cm3. Recent stellar occultation
data show that Quaoar, once thought to be essentially pure
rock (Fraser & Brown 2010; Fraser et al. 2013), is more ice-
rich, with ¯ρ = 1.99 ± 0.46 g/cm3 (Braga-Ribas et al. 2013).

Why are the dwarf planets so rock-rich, and why do
they exhibit such a large range of densities? The estimated
densities of smaller KBOs, like Salacia (radius ∼ 430 km,
¯ρ = 1.29+0.29
−0.23 g/cm3 (Fornasier et al. 2013)), and 2002 UX25
(radius ∼ 325 km, ¯ρ = 0.82 ± 0.11 g/cm3 (Brown 2013)), in-
dicate low rock fractions, even when porosity is accounted for
(Brown 2013). Thus, simply accreting large rock-rich KBOs
from these smaller, rock-poor bodies is not a viable scenario
(Brown 2013), and other processes must be at work.

The presence of moons around the dwarf planets points
toward planet-scale collisions as a means of changing KBO
densities (Brown et al. 2007; Brown 2008; Brown 2013). Col-
lisions between large KBOs are thought to be common, oc-
curring every ∼ 100 to 300 Myr (Kenyon & Bromley 2013)
throughout the history of the solar system. The high angular
momentum per unit mass of the Pluto/Charon system sug-
gests that the system formed via an impact (Canup 2005).
There is direct evidence that Haumea was modiﬁed by a
collision: Haumea is the progenitor of a collisional family of
ice-rich and neutral-coloured objects identiﬁed in the Kuiper
belt (Brown et al. 2007; Snodgrass et al. 2010; Carry et al.
2012), thought to be fragments of the mantle removed from
the body. In its present state, Haumea has a water ice-rich
spectrum but a rock-rich composition, and is spinning at
nearly break-up speed.

Here, we show that the dwarf planet systems fall into
two categories, when characterised by the bulk density of
their primary object and the size ratio between moons and
primary. We hypothesise that the two types of systems
formed in two types of collisions. Low-velocity collisions be-
tween undiﬀerentiated primordial dwarf planets make large
planet/moon pairs, in which both bodies retain their original
compositions, similar to Pluto/Charon. Higher velocity col-
lisions between fully diﬀerentiated dwarf planets could yield
rock-enriched primaries with small ice-rich satellites.

2 DWARF PLANET SYSTEM PROPERTIES

We consider KBOs with a primary or secondary whose eﬀec-
tive radius is greater than ∼500 km or absolute magnitude
(H) less than 3, the magnitude at which the number and
sizes of objects begins to deviate from a power law (Brown
2008). At the time of writing, this consists of ﬁve dwarf
planets with semi-major axes > 30 AU, for which we have
mass and size measurements: Pluto, Quaoar, Eris, Orcus,
and Haumea. Of the satellites of the dwarf planet systems,
only Charon, Pluto’s largest moon, satisﬁes these require-
ments and is included in our sample. Previous works have
compared the icy dwarf planets to Triton, an irregular satel-
lite of Neptune, thought to have originated in the same re-
gion as the largest KBOs and been captured by Neptune
(McKinnon 1984; Goldreich et al. 1989; Agnor & Hamilton
2006; Nogueira et al. 2011).

Table 1 summarises the radii and mean densities of
each of these objects. We calculate the density of the pri-
mary object from the system mass and the best mea-
sured eﬀective primary radius. System masses are taken
from Brown & Schaller (2007); Ragozzine & Brown (2009);
Brown et al. (2010); Fraser et al. (2013) and Brozovi´c et al.
(2015). If stellar occultations or New Horizons measure-
ments are available, we use those size estimates for the
primary body (Sicardy et al. 2011; Braga-Ribas et al. 2013;
Stern et al. 2015). For Orcus/Vanth, we use estimates of
sizes based on modeling Spitzer observations (Brown et al.
2010). Otherwise, the most recent Herschel observations for
the eﬀective system radius are used (Fornasier et al. 2013).
For the Pluto-Charon system, the exact masses and den-
sities are both bodies are known (Brozovi´c et al. 2015). We
do not yet know the relative sizes of Orcus and its moon
Vanth. The thermal emission from the total system is con-
sistent with a single body of radius 470±35 km (Brown et al.
2010). But estimates of the sizes of each body requires that
assuming albedoes for each body. In Table 1, we report
two values for the radius of Orcus, one assuming Vanth
has an albedo equal to that of Orcus (Brown et al. 2010),
which yields a density for both members of the system
¯ρ = 1.605 ± 0.03 g/cm3. If Vanth has an albedo half that
of Orcus, the radius of Orcus is 430 km, yielding a density
for Orcus and Vanth ¯ρ = 1.747 ± 0.03 g/cm3 (Brown et al.
2010). The assumption of unequal albedoes seems consis-
tent with the disparate surface compositions of the objects:

Vanth does not share the water absorption feature present
in the infrared spectrum of Orcus, indicating that the two
bodies have diﬀerent surface compositions (Brown & Calvin
2000; Brown et al. 2010). Both pairs of size estimates for Or-
cus and Vanth are similar to the sizes derived from Herschel
data (Fornasier et al. 2013).

For Eris, Haumea, and Quaoar, we know the system
mass; the satellites are so small that assumptions about
their physical properties do not aﬀect the estimate of pri-
mary mass (Brown & Schaller 2007; Ragozzine & Brown
2009; Fraser et al. 2013). However, it is worth noting that
the primaries and moons in each of these systems have
similar colour,
in contrast to Orcus and Vanth (e.g.,
Brown 2008 and references therein). The large uncertainty
in the density for Quaoar is due to the uncertainty in
Quaoar’s mass (Fraser et al. 2013; Braga-Ribas et al. 2013).
At present, there are no independent estimates for size
and density for Haumea. The current estimates for its size
and density, which come from combining optical and ther-
mal data (Lellouch et al. 2010; Lockwood et al. 2014), re-
port only their best-ﬁtting results, and give the same den-
sity of 2.6 g/cm3. Haumea has a spin period of 3.9 days
(Lacerda et al. 2008), and has a shape best ﬁt by a tri-
axial ellipsoid (Rabinowitz et al. 2006; Lellouch et al. 2010;
Lockwood et al. 2014). We use the eﬀective radius measured
from Hershel observations (Fornasier et al. 2013).

Figure 1 illustrates the sizes and densities of the dwarf
planet primaries. Brown (2008) notes no statistically sig-
niﬁcant correlation between size and density; the updated
masses and radii determined in the last few years seem to
support this conclusion. We are also interested in the relative
sizes of the satellites versus the primary, which we describe
as q = Msatellites/(Msatellites + Mp), the ratio between the
combined masses of the satellites and the total system mass,
where Mp is the mass of the primary.

Table 2 summarises the q values for each of the systems.
To derive q, we assume equal albedos and densities for all
of the bodies in the Eris and Quaoar systems. Thus, our
values of q are upper limits; if the small satellites are more
ice-rich than their primaries, the true q values for Eris and
Quaoar could be smaller. For Haumea, we use estimates of
the masses of each satellite from the multi-body orbital ﬁts of
Ragozzine & Brown (2009). For Orcus/Vanth, the assump-
tion of equal albedo is known to be inaccurate. Following
(Brown et al. 2010), we report two values of q, one assum-
ing the bodies have the same albedo, and the other where
we assume the albedo of Vanth is a factor of two lower than

3 TWO CLASSES OF DWARF PLANET

DENSITIES

We ﬁnd that the systems fall into two categories when clas-
siﬁed by q (see Figure 2). Excluding Triton, bodies with den-
sities >2 g/cm3, Haumea, Quaoar, and Eris, have extremely
small satellites, indicated by small q values. More ice-rich
bodies, including Pluto, Charon, and Orcus, are part of sys-
tems with large moons. In a collision, the mass of the ﬁnal
moon and the system’s ﬁnal q value depend on the speed, an-
gle, and impactor-to-total mass ratio, and the diﬀerentiation
state of the precursor objects (see, e.g., Leinhardt & Stewart
2012 for discussion).

We hypothesise that the two categories represent two
classes of collision, each of which has a diﬀerent eﬀect on
the densities of the ﬁnal objects. Systems with large moons
originate in low-velocity, grazing collisions between undif-
ferentiated precursors. These collisions involve little-to-no
vaporisation or melting, and so both bodies retain their pri-
mordial compositions. Thus, the primordial composition of
Kuiper Belt material can be inferred from the present com-
positions of members of these systems. Systems with rock-
rich primaries and small moons originate in a diﬀerent type
of collision (see Brown 2008 and references therein), perhaps
a “graze and merge” (Leinhardt et al. 2010), or another type
of collision yet to be identiﬁed by numerical simulations.

3.1 Lower Density, Large Moons

3.1.1 Pluto/Charon

Successful impact scenarios for the formation of the Pluto
system involve an impactor-to-total mass ratio, γ = 0.3
to 0.5,
implying that precursor bodies range from 0.3
MT to 0.7MT (Canup 2011), where the total mass of
the Pluto/Charon system, MT = 1.463 × 1025 grams
(Stern et al. 2015). The successful collisions are gentle,
with impact velocities vimp ≈ vesc, where vesc =

p(2GMT )/(Ri + Rt), where Ri and Rt are the radii of

the impactor and target, respectively (Canup 2011); for the
Pluto/Charon system, vesc ∼ 1 km/s. The peak shock pres-
sure at the point of impact, P ∼ ρv2
∼ 1 GPa (Melosh
1989), is barely high enough to melt ice (Stewart & Ahrens
2005; Barr & Citron 2011). Impact simulations show that
the temperature rise in the interiors of both bodies ∆T ∼
tens of K (Canup 2005). The successful collision is so oblique
that the bodies do not undergo signiﬁcant mixing or modify
their original densities.

imp

Canup (2011) shows that the mixed ice/rock compo-
sition of Charon is best reproduced by impacts in which
one or both objects are undiﬀerentiated. The most success-
ful cases are those in which 90% of both precursor bodies
are composed of an intimate mixture of ice and rock, with
the remaining 10% of their masses composed of pure water
ice, likely in an outer ice shell (Canup 2011). If both bod-
ies have undergone complete ice/rock separation, their rock
cores merge during the collision, and the relatively small
amount of material launched into orbit is too ice-rich to ac-
count for Charon’s mean density (Canup 2005; Canup 2011).
The small ice-rich satellites of Pluto, Styx, Nix, Kerberos,
and Hydra, represent fragments of the pure ice mantles of the
precursor bodies launched into orbit by the collision (Canup
2011; Kenyon & Bromley 2013).

3.1.2 Orcus/Vanth

The Orcus/Vanth system shares several similarities to
Pluto/Charon, including its q value and dynamical state.
Vanth orbits Orcus at a distance of a = 8980±20 km
(Brown et al. 2010), ∼ 20 Orcus radii, similar to Charon’s
orbit, at ∼ 15 Pluto radii. Like Pluto and Charon, Orcus and
Vanth show diﬀerent spectral features indicating slightly dif-
ferent surface composition (Brown et al. 2010; Carry et al.
2011).

Two possible modes of origin have been suggested
for the system: a giant impact followed by tidal evolu-
tion to a low-eccentricity orbit and capture into a high-
inclination orbit followed by damping by the Kozai mech-

anism (Brown et al. 2010). If the system formed as a result
of a giant impact, the masses of Orcus and Vanth are high
enough to permit the system to have evolved into at least a
synchronous state (in which the orbital period of Vanth is
equal to its rotation period) (Brown et al. 2010).

If the system has achieved its ﬁnal dual synchronous
state, the angular momentum of the system about its centre
of mass (Canup 2005),

Lsys ≈

qωMsysa2
(1 + q)2 ,

(1)

where Msys is the combined masses of Orcus and Vanth,
and a is the semi-major axis of Vanth’s orbit. This is com-
sysRsys)1/2, where Rsys =
monly scaled by L′ = (GM 3
[Msys/(4/3π ¯ρ)]1/3. The normalised system angular momen-
tum, J = Lsys/L′ (Canup 2005). For Orcus/Vanth, J ≈ 0.12
to 0.30. By comparison, J ≈ 0.28 for post-encounter sys-
tem properties for Pluto/Charon, and J ≈ 0.11 for the
Earth/Moon system (Canup 2004).

Thus, it seems plausible that the system formed as
a result of a giant impact, similar in character to the
Pluto/Charon collision. With these values of q and J, the
Orcus/Vanth system falls into the range of impact out-
comes reported by Canup (2005) in her initial search for
the Pluto/Charon impact. Two of the outcomes from Canup
(2005) yield the proper q and J for Orcus/Vanth, but were
performed for larger MT . The candidate collisions occur be-
tween undiﬀerentiated objects, with γ = 0.3, vimp ∼ 1.1 to
1.2vesc, which would correspond to about 0.3 to 0.4 km/s
for Orcus/Vanth. Thus, the system could have formed from
a collision between undiﬀerentiated objects ranging in size
from 300 to 400 km.

Regardless of its mode of origin, Orcus and Vanth have
likely retained much of their primordial compositions. If
Vanth were captured, modiﬁcation of its orbit by tidal fric-
tion would cause an average temperature rise of only ∼ 1
to 10 K for the duration of the orbital evolution (Ragozzine
2009). The candidate collisions would result in little-to-no
mass loss, melting, or vaporisation, and little heating (Canup
2005), preserving the primordial compositions of both bod-
ies. This may explain why Orcus and Vanth have vastly dif-
ferent colours, unlike the satellite systems of Eris, Haumea,
and Quaoar, for which satellite colours are highly correlated
with the colour of the primary (Brown et al. 2010). The
colour diﬀerence between Orcus and Vanth is much larger
than the typical color diﬀerences observed in smaller KBO
binaries, which also points toward a possible impact origin
(Benecchi et al. 2009).

3.2 Higher Density, Small Moons

Because Eris, Quaoar, and Haumea have similar q val-
ues, it seems likely that all three bodies suﬀered a similar
type of collision. After the discovery of Haumea, the ﬁrst
collisional family in the Kuiper belt (Brown et al. 2007),
numerical simulations were performed to study its origin
(Leinhardt et al. 2010). To date, no numerical simulations
have been performed for the origin of the Eris and Quaoar
systems.

Leinhardt et al. (2010) ﬁnd that scenarios yielding the
proper dynamical state for the system involve the collision
of two diﬀerentiated ice/rock bodies Ri = Rt =650 km and

MNRAS 000, 1–8 (2016)

Mi = Mt = 2.25 × 1024 grams, a little bit larger than Orcus.
The collision occurs at vimp ∼ 0.8 to 0.9 km/s, comparable
to the Pluto/Charon impact, with little melting or vapori-
sation. In the half-dozen cases that successfully reproduce a
rapidly spinning primary with small icy moons, the impactor
and target actually collide twice (Leinhardt et al. 2010). The
ﬁrst collision gravitationally binds the impactor to the tar-
get and sets the system spinning; the second collision is
a merger. When the impactor and target merge, the rock
cores of both objects merge. This behaviour has also been
observed in the impact that formed Earth’s Moon (Canup
2004). The central body spins more rapidly after the rock
cores merge, due to the decrease of its moment of inertia.
A bar instability, similar to that observed in galaxy merg-
ers (e.g., Barnes 2002) develops, which lofts mantle ice into
orbit. The orbiting ice clumps together to make Haumea’s
small moons. Statistically, such collisions are expected to be
common in the scattered disc (Levison et al. 2008).

Unfortunately, this scenario does not reproduce the
rock-rich composition of the Haumea primary, nor is it a par-
ticularly realistic collisional scenario. The successful cases
begin with impactor and target densities of 2.0 g/cm2 (which
we now know is actually more rock-rich than either Pluto
or Charon), and yields primary densities only marginally in-
creased to 2.1 and 2.2 g/cm3, much lower than the 2.6 g/cm3
observed (Leinhardt et al. 2010). Secondly, the only scenar-
ios that yield the rapidly spinning primary and the proper
moon masses are those between identical objects (γ = 0.5),
with equal masses and radii. This is highly unlikely. More-
over, an idealised numerical impact simulation, a perfectly
symmetric initial condition such as that used in the Haumea
impact can only yield a symmetric outcome: a disc (Canup
2010).

With new constraints on the sizes and compositions of
Eris and Quaoar, it may now be worthwhile to search for im-
pact conditions that could have modiﬁed the densities and
formed the satellites of these systems. Before searching for
candidate impact scenarios, it is important to determine why
the Haumea simulations were so unsuccessful. Why don’t nu-
merical impact simulations yield rock-rich primaries? Intu-
itively, high-velocity grazing impacts could plausibly “chip
oﬀ” fragments of ice from the mantle of a fully diﬀerenti-
ated primary body, leaving behind a rock-enriched primary
with a rapid spin (Brown et al. 2007; Brown 2013). Indeed,
if such a collision occurred in the Kuiper belt, any fragments
launched from the primary at vesc would soon become phys-
ically and dynamically separated from the primary because
the Keplerian orbital velocities are similar to vesc for many
dwarf planet systems. This has been demonstrated for the
Haumea family by Lykawka et al. (2012).

Despite eﬀorts to demonstrate this numerically, the
mode of ice loss in dwarf planet collisions remains unclear.
We suggest two reasons why this might be the case. One pos-
sibility is that we have not yet identiﬁed the proper impact
conditions (velocity, γ, impact angle, diﬀerentiation state
of precursors). Because numerical simulations have explored
the origin of only two dwarf planet systems, it seems likely
that there are signiﬁcant areas of parameter space that re-
main unexplored. For example, an improbable, but not im-

of impact conditions could be a fruitful avenue for future
research.

Another possibility is that the material strength of ice,
which has been ignored in all prior simulations of dwarf
planet collisions, could modify how the bodies respond
to compression during the collision. Strength eﬀects are
thought to be important if the yield stress of the material
σY ∼ ̺gR, where g is the local gravity (Melosh 1989), a
condition not met for rock or ice on the dwarf planets. How-
ever, material strength is known to change the partitioning
of compressional deformation and heat in the early stages of
the impact (Grady 1980), and can lead to radically diﬀer-
ent outcomes in laboratory (Stickle & Schultz 2011) and nu-
merical (Schultz 2011) collisions between spherical objects.
The eﬀects could be pronounced in a diﬀerentiated body
composed of rock and ice, for which σY varies by an or-
der of magnitude. Recent eﬀorts to compare outcomes of
icy body collisions with and without strength show that
while the compositions of the ﬁnal bodies may be some-
what similar in both cases, there is substantially more ice
fragmentation in the cases including strength (Maindl et al.
2014). Notably, Maindl et al. (2014) report a single unusual
Haumea-like outcome in which a diﬀerentiated ice-rock body
is spun beyond its breakup limit, permitting its ice mantle
to fracture and loft into orbit, losing 15% of the total system
water content in the process.

4 PRIMORDIAL DENSITY OF KUIPER BELT

MATERIAL

If Pluto and Charon represent samples of the source mate-
rial for the Kuiper Belt objects, we can estimate an over-
all bulk density for that material, ̺, using an average den-
sity for the system, ρsys = (MP + MC )/(VP + VC), where
MP and MC are the masses of Pluto and Charon, and VP
and VC are their volumes. Updated values from New Hori-
zons gives ̺ = 1.842 g/cm3. Alternatively, one could also
view the individual densities of Pluto and Charon as an
upper and lower bound on the primordial density, yielding
̺ = 1.781 ± 0.08 g/cm3. In either case, it seems ̺ ≈ 1.8
g/cm3. This is not dissimilar from the bulk system den-
sities of the Uranian satellites, ρsys = 1.63 g/cm3, which
are similar in size to the dwarf planets. We note there may
be a continuum of KBO densities up to our proposed pri-
mordial density for the dwarf planet-sized bodies. Mid-sized
bodies like Varda and Salacia have densities greater than
1 g/cm3 and less than 1.5 g/cm3 (Stansberry et al. 2012;
Grundy et al. 2015). Bodies with radii less than ∼ 400 km,
including 2002 UX25 and Typhon, have measured densities
less than 1 g/cm3 (Grundy et al. 2008; Brown 2013).

This range of bulk densities implies a rock mass frac-
tion ∼ 72% for a nominal ice density ρi = 0.92 g/cm3
and rock density ρr = 3.0 g/cm3. We have chosen a rock
density mid-way between ρr = 3.3 g/cm3 for Prinn-Fegley
rock, and ρr = 2.8 g/cm3, the grain density of CI chon-
drite, thought to be the rocky component of the icy satellites
(Mueller & McKinnon 1988). The rock density may be lower
if the rock is hydrated, but this is unlikely because both bod-
ies would get hot enough to dehydrate silicate in the ﬁrst
billion years of their evolution (Malamud & Prialnik 2015).
Compression of rock and ices at depth is not a signiﬁcant ef-

6

Barr and Schwamb

fect in bodies of this size (Lupo & Lewis 1979; Brown 2013),
but the ice density may also be higher if the ice contains sig-
niﬁcant hydrocarbons (McKinnon et al. 2008), which could
be tested with New Horizons surface spectra.

How can one create the high-density dwarf planets from
this primordial material? Eris can achieve its present density
of 2.52 g/cm3 with a single core-merging collision between
two primordial-composition objects with combined masses
MT = 2.1×1025 g, each of which would be roughly the size of
Pluto. If only 15% of the total mass was lost, and that mass
was composed of pure ice, Eris could achieve its present-
day mean density. Quaoar’s present density ρ = 1.99 g/cm3
can be achieved in a core-merging collision between two ̺
primordial objects of radii 405 km, close to the estimated
size of Vanth, and smaller than Charon. Similarly, loss of
10% of the total impacting mass, in ice, would give Quaoar
the proper density. The Haumea-forming collision similar
to that suggested by Leinhardt et al. (2010) could yield a
primary of proper density if ∼ 20% of icy material was lost
from the system. It is interesting to note that these loss rates
are not dissimilar from those observed in by Maindl et al.
(2014), and that the amount of ice removed from Haumea
and Quaoar impacts is comparable in magnitude to the mass
of Salacia.

5 TRITON

Triton’s inclined and retrograde orbit strongly suggests that
it is a captured satellite (McKinnon 1984; Goldreich et al.
1989; Agnor & Hamilton 2006; Nogueira et al. 2011). The
current favoured scenario for capture involves an encounter
of a binary Kuiper Belt system with Neptune, in which Tri-
ton represents one member of the binary; the other having
been lost (Agnor & Hamilton 2006). Early works on the cap-
ture scenario suggested that if Triton were a captured Kuiper
Belt object, its ice/rock ratio should be similar to Pluto and
thus similar to the primordial densities of the other distant
dwarf planets (McKinnon & Mueller 1989). This viewpoint
was bolstered by the remarkable equality between the den-
sity of Triton, 2.06 g/cm3, and the best pre-encounter esti-
mates of Pluto’s density from multi-body orbital ﬁts, 2.06
g/cm3 (Tholen et al. 2008).

For most of the age of the Solar System, Triton has been
in a diﬀerent environment than the dwarf planets. Thus, di-
rect comparisons with the dwarf planets may not be valid.
With the updated density for Pluto, it seems that Triton
contains more rock than Pluto and has a density closer
to Quaoar. Here, we re-examine Triton’s thermal history
and assess whether tidal heating during its orbital evolution
post-capture could have modiﬁed its ice/rock ratio.

After

have

capture, Triton would

experienced
an episode of
strong tidal heating (McKinnon 1984;
Goldreich et al. 1989; Ross & Schubert 1990; Correia 2009;
Nogueira et al. 2011) as its orbit around Neptune decreased
from an original semi-major axis of ao ∼ 80-1000 RN
to its present day value of af = 14.3RN (Nogueira et al.
2011). The vast majority of this energy is dissipated within
Triton (McKinnon 1984). The total energy per unit mass
dissipated in Triton to date is equal to the diﬀerence
between the speciﬁc orbital energy of the captured object

and Triton’s present orbit (McKinnon et al. 1995),

∆E = (cid:18) GMN

2af

−

GMN

2ao (cid:19),

(2)

where G is the gravitational constant, MN is the mass of
Neptune, ao is Triton’s semi-major axis from Neptune at
capture, and af is the semi-major axis of Triton’s orbit
around Neptune today. The amount of energy is relatively
insensitive to the assumed value of ao because ao >> af .
Regardless of the details of the capture scenario, ∆E ≈ 1011
erg/g, a factor of 3 higher than the latent heat of sublima-
tion of water ice Ls = 2.8 × 1010 erg/g (Kieﬀer et al. 2006).
Alternatively, for a speciﬁc heat Cp ∼ 107 erg/g K appro-
priate for rocky and icy material, this gives a temperature
rise ∆T ∼ 104 K, suﬃcient to melt Triton’s ice and rock
(McKinnon et al. 1995).

Numerical integrations of the tidal evolution equations
coupled with thermal evolution models show that the vast
majority of the tidal heat is dissipated in a short period of
time, with strong heating lasting only a few hundred million
to a billion years (McKinnon 1984; Goldreich et al. 1989;
Ross & Schubert 1990; Prockter et al. 2005). During this
brief epoch of strong heating, the surface heat ﬂow peaks
at F ∼ 0.5 W/m2 (500 erg/s cm2), about half the observed
heat ﬂow from Io (e.g.,Veeder et al. 1994).

Heat ﬂows of this magnitude, ∼ 0.25 W/m2 (250
erg/s cm2) (Howett et al. 2011) have also been observed
in the south polar terrain of Saturn’s icy moon Ence-
ladus, which is experiencing an episode of high tidal
heating (Meyer & Wisdom 2007) and concomitant ice loss
(Porco et al. 2006; Hansen et al. 2006; Waite et al. 2006).
Much of the thermal emission from Enceladus is coming
from four linear features (Spencer et al. 2006) about 130
km long and 2 km across (Porco et al. 2006), which are also
the source of water-rich plume eruptions, that are removing
˙ME ∼ 2 ×105 grams of water-rich material from the satellite
per second (Hansen et al. 2006).

A rough estimate of the eﬃciency of conversion from
tidal heat to sublimation and loss from an icy body can be
obtained from the present energy budget of Saturn’s moon
Enceladus. We construct a crude “eﬃciency factor” using a
ratio between the measured mass loss rate times the latent
˙Etidal ∼ (∆E/τ ),
heat and dividing by the tidal heat power,

f ∼

˙MELs
˙Etidal

(3)

which gives f ∼ 0.036. If Triton uses f = 3.6% of its tidal
power to sublimate and lose ice, the total mass lost over
a τ ∼ 500 Myr episode of intense heating is 2.5 × 1024
grams, about half of the present-day mass of ice in Triton.
Adding back this mass of ice would yield a body with density
ρ = 1.84 g/cm3, similar to Pluto, and radius R ∼ 1455 km,
within the range of other dwarf planets. Although we do not
know the exact devolatilization history of Triton, we show
that the thermal energy dissipated during its post-capture
orbital evolution is capable of modifying a pre-capture Tri-
ton from an original Pluto-like primordial density of ∼ 1.8
g/cm3 to its present composition, depending on the value of
f .

A range of binary mass ratios produce a viable capture
Triton scenario, but we note that the all modelling attempts
have used the present-day mass of Triton for one of the bod-

MNRAS 000, 1–8 (2016)

ies in the binary. The most successful capture scenarios from
Vokrouhlick´y et al. (2008) require a pre-capture binary q of
∼ 0.25 to 0.333. During Neptune’s subsequent planetesimal-
driven migration, Nogueira et al. (2011) can produce suc-
cessful captures with a escaping binary companion with 0.1,
0.3, 1, and 3 Triton masses (implying q values of 0.09, 0.23,
0.5, and 0.25 respectively). This could place the pre-cursor
binary system in density-q space close to Pluto/Charon and
Orcus/Vanth, the two other systems we propose formed in a
gentle collision, potentially enabling Triton to have our pro-
posed primordial density at the time of Neptune capture.

Regardless of the exact scenario for Triton’s origin, we
show that the tidal heating from its initial orbital evolution
is suﬃcient to remove a substantial amount of ice from the
body. Thus, Triton’s present composition may not be pri-
mordial, and should not be used as a standard by which to
interpret the densities of the largest bodies in the Kuiper
belt.

6 CONCLUSIONS

We now have good estimates for the sizes and densities of
the largest objects in the Kuiper belt, the dwarf planets
with absolute magnitude less than 3, corresponding to radii
& 500 km. Many of these objects have moons, which has
facilitated estimates of the mass of the central body. Colli-
sions have undoubtedly played a role in shaping the compo-
sition of the distant dwarf planets. We have shown that these
systems fall into two broad categories, and we hypothesise
that these categories represent the products of two types of
planet-scale collision. Pluto/Charon and Orcus/Vanth com-
prise one category, formed from a gentle, grazing collision
with little to no vaporisation, melting, or heating, and very
little mass loss. We propose that the composition of these
bodies may represent the bulk composition of the primordial
material from which the Kuiper belt objects accreted, with
density ̺ ∼ 1.8 g/cm3. Triton could have been composed of
this primordial material at the time of capture, but vigorous
tidal heating and volatile loss could have modiﬁed Triton’s
composition.

Eris, Haumea, and Quaoar, with small satellites and
high rock fractions, comprise the other category. Collisions
between Orcus-to-Pluto-sized objects, in which a few tens
of percent of the system is carried away in icy fragments,
could explain the ice-rich compositions of these three bodies.
However, numerical simulations have so far failed to produce
such outcomes. We suggest that the gap between model and
observation could be bridged by a broader exploration of im-
pact parameter space, or by adding physical processes hith-
erto overlooked, such as material strength (Stickle & Schultz
2011; Schultz 2011; Maindl et al. 2014).

If signiﬁcant ice was lost from Eris and Quaoar in col-
lisions, these objects may have had (or presently have) col-
lisional families. Identiﬁcation of collisional families in the
Kuiper Belt is diﬃcult because fragments lost during a col-
lision have velocities comparable to the Keplerian orbital ve-
locity, and do not remain in physical or dynamical proximity
to the parent dwarf planet (e.g., Lykawka et al. 2012). The
Haumea family was identiﬁed due to the unique spectral sig-
nature of its members (Brown et al. 2007). It is possible this

could provide a means by which collisional families could be
identiﬁed for Eris and Quaoar.

If our hypothesis is true, we predict that dwarf plan-
ets without moons should have a mean density comparable
to that of the Pluto/Charon system. Speciﬁcally, we predict
that the overall system density of the Orcus/Vanth system is
comparable to this primordial density. Improved estimates
of the sizes of Orcus and Vanth are crucial to testing our
hypothesis. Stellar occultation measurements could yield the
sizes of Orcus, which would help to further constrain its bulk
density. Also, the present estimate for the density of Quaoar,
1.99±0.46 g/cm3, is tantalisingly close to our estimate of the
primordial density. An improved measurement of the mass
of Quaoar, which is the main driver of uncertainty in the es-
timate for mean density, could distinguish whether Quaoar
is truly similar to Eris and Haumea (low q and high ¯ρ),
or whether it suﬀered a diﬀerent type of collision. Finally,
the overwhelming majority of impact simulations have used
¯ρ ∼ 2 g/cm3 material as a starting point, have overlooked
the possible importance of material strength (Maindl et al.
2014), and have explored only a small area of the total im-
pact parameter space. More impact simulations with more
realistic material behaviors, and a variety of impact condi-
tions and compositional initial states are crucial to improv-
ing our understanding of role of collisions in modifying dwarf
planet densities.
