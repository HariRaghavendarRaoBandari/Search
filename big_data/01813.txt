CHARACTERIZATION OF CIRCUITS SUPPORTING POLYNOMIAL

SYSTEMS WITH THE MAXIMAL NUMBER OF POSITIVE SOLUTIONS

BOULOS EL HILANY

Abstract. A polynomial system with n equations in n variables supported on a set W ⊂ Rn
of n + 2 points has at most n + 1 non-degenerate positive solutions. Moreover, if this bound is
reached, then W is minimally aﬃnely dependent, in other words, it is a circuit in Rn. For any
positive integer number n, we determine all circuits W ⊂ Rn which can support a polynomial
system with n+1 non-degenerate positive solutions. Restrictions on such circuits W are obtained
using Grothendieck’s real dessins d’enfant, while polynomial systems with n + 1 non-degenerate
positive solutions are constructed using Viro’s combinatorial patchworking.

1. Introduction

The support W of a polynomial f ∈ C[z±1

n ] is the set of points w ∈ Zn corresponding
to monomials zw appearing with a non-zero coeﬃcient in f . The support of a polynomial system

1 , . . . , z±1

((cid:63))

f1(z) = ··· = fn(z) = 0,

in n variables is the union of supports of the individual polynomials f1, . . . , fn. An important
result by Kouchnirenko in [10] shows that the number of non-degenerate solutions of ((cid:63)) in
(C∗)n is at most n! Vol(∆W ), where Vol(∆W ) is the standard Euclidean volume of the convex
hull ∆W of W. Real polynomial systems (deﬁned by polynomials with real coeﬃcients) appear
ubiquitously in mathematics, and we are interested in estimating their numbers of real solutions.
Although both Bezout’s and Kouchnirenko’ bounds hold true for the number of non-degenerate
solutions in (R∗)n as well, the resulting bounds are not always sharp. This typically happens
when W has few elements comparatively to ∆W ∩ Zn. A particular attention is paid on the
positive solutions of ((cid:63)), which are the solutions contained in the positive orthant of Rn. Indeed,
assume that there exists a sharp upper bound NW on the number of non-degenerate positive
solutions of ((cid:63)) that depends only on W. Then this NW also bounds the number of solutions
contained in any other orthant, and thus ((cid:63)) will not have more than 2nNW solutions in (R∗)n.
Descartes showed in 1637 that we have NW = |W| − 1 for n = 1, but still, before Khovanskii’s
book [9], it was not clear that such NW even exists for n ≥ 2. He proved that the number of non-
degenerate positive solutions of a system of n equations in n variables having a total of n + k + 1
distinct monomials is bounded by 2(n+k
2 )(n + 1)n+k. This bound was later improved by F. Bihan
2)nk, however only a handful of sharp fewnomial bounds are known
and F. Sottile [7] to e2+3
(c.f. [3, 5, 11]). When k = 0, the system ((cid:63)) can be reduced to a system where each polynomial
is a binomial, and thus has at most one non-degenerate positive solution. The previous bounds
on the number of non-degenerate positive solutions also hold true for (generalized) polynomial
systems with support W ⊂ Rn, which are systems where each equation is a linear combination
of monomials with real exponents.

One of the ﬁrst non-trivial cases arises when n ≥ 2 and k = 1, in which case the support
is a set of n + 2 points in Rn. F. Bihan [3] proved that any polynomial system supported
on such W has at most n + 1 non-degenerate positive solutions. Moreover, if this bound is

reached, then W is minimally aﬃnely dependent, which means that it is a circuit in Rn. In the
following we assume that W is a circuit in Rn. Note that up to a scalar multiplication, there
exists a unique aﬃne relation on W. Polynomial systems supported on a circuit in Zn whose
all non-degenerate complex solutions are positive have been studied in [2] (such systems are
called maximally positive). As a main result, it is given for any positive integer n a ﬁnite list
of circuits in Zn that can support maximally positive systems up to the obvious action of the
group of invertible integer aﬃne transformations of Zn. Also for the circuit case, a very recent
generalization of the Descartes’ rule of sign was developed by F. Bihan and A. Dickenstein in [4].
This gave some conditions on both the circuit and the coeﬃcient matrix that are necessary for
the system to have n + 1 non-degenerate positive solutions. More precisely, the authors in [4]
show that if such system has n + 1 non-degenerate positive solutions, then all maximal minors

of the coeﬃcient matrix are nonzero and any aﬃne relation(cid:80)n+2

number (up to 1 if n is odd) of positive coeﬃcients as that of negative ones.

In this paper, we completely characterize the circuits which are supports of polynomial systems

with n + 1 non-degenerate positive solutions.

F. Bihan proved in [2] that if a circuit in Zn supports a maximally positive system with n + 1
non-degenerate positive solutions, then it has a primitive aﬃne relation (i.e. aﬃne relation with
coprime integer coeﬃcients) as in Theorem 1.1 with α1 = βn+2 = 1 and all other coeﬃcients
are equal to two. This can be seen as a consequence of Theorem 1.1 (see Example ??). Indeed,
if W supports a maximally positive system with n + 1 non-degenerate positive solutions, then
s+1 βiwi is a primitive
s+1 βi = n + 1 (see [2] for more details), which together with
In order to prove Theorem 1.1, one can reduce to the case where W ⊂ Zn. Indeed, assume that
a system with support W = {w1, . . . , wn+2} ⊂ Rn has n + 1 non-degenerate positive solutions.
Then for i = 1, . . . , n + 2, points ˜wi ∈ Qn that are suﬃciently close to wi support a (generalized)
polynomial system with the same coeﬃcients and having at least n + 1 non-degenerate positive
solutions, and thus exactly this number of non-degenerate positive solutions since n + 1 is an
upper bound. Now, multiplying all ˜wi by some integer, one acquires a system supported on
a circuit in Zn with n + 1 non-degenerate positive solutions. Since the inequalities appearing

i=1 αiwi =(cid:80)n+2

inequalities in Theorem 1.1 imply the desired equalities.

Assume that W = {w1, . . . , wn+2} is a set of n + 2 points in Zn and consider any aﬃne
i=1 λiwi = 0 with integer coeﬃcients. After a small perturbation, any system with

, where (1.1) can be completely recoverd from the function ϕ
and vice-versa. We apply Gale duality (c.f. [2, 6, 7]) to obtain a correspondence between non-
degenerate solutions of a system supported on W and those of ϕ(y) = 1. This correspondence
restricts to a bijection between non-degenerate positive solutions of the system and the solutions
contained in the (possibly empty) interval ∆+ := {y ∈ R| Pi(y) > 0 for i = 1, . . . , n + 1}. After
homogenization, we get a real rational map CP 1 → CP 1 that we denote again by ϕ. The real
dessin d’enfant Γ associated to ϕ : CP 1 → CP 1, is the inverse image of the real projective line
under ϕ. Given that ϕ(y) = 1 has n + 1 solutions in ∆+, we deduce by analyzing Γ in Section 3
the inequalities of Theorem 1.1.

The solutions of ϕ(y) = 1 in ∆+ are roots of the Gale polynomial

construct polynomial systems (1.1) supported on a circuit in Zn with n + 1 non-degenerate
positive solutions using Viro polynomials Pi,t(y) = ai + tαibi, where ai, bi, αi ∈ R, and t > 0 is
a parameter that will be taken small enough. They apply the version of Viro’s combinatorial
patchworking developed in [14] which involves mixed subdivision of Newton polytopes. Here, we
also use Viro polynomials Pi,t, but look directly at the roots of the corresponding Gale polyno-
mial in ∆+. The inequalities in Theorem 1.1 appear explicitly as being necessary to construct
polynomial systems (1.1) with n+1 non-degenerate positive solution using Viro polynomials Pi,t.

2. Technical Preamble

Given a system of n polynomials in n variables with total support a circuit W = {w1, . . . , wn+2},
perturbing slightly its coeﬃcients if necessary, we may assume that the coeﬃcients of zw1, . . . , zwn
in the system form an invertible matrix (a small perturbation does not decrease the number of
non-degenerate positive solutions). Since we are only interested in non-degenerate positive so-
lutions, we may assume that wn+2 = 0 and we transform ((cid:63)) via Gaussian elimination into an
equivalent system such that the coeﬃcients of zw1, . . . , zwn form a diagonal matrix

(2.1)
where Pi(zwn+1) = ai + bizwn+1 for i = 1, . . . , n. We start by giving a brief description about
Gale duality for the system (2.1) (c.f. [2, 3, 6]). We use the linear relations on W to obtain

point of ϕ. In what follows, we see ϕ (after homogenization) as a real rational map CP 1 → CP 1.

Assume that ∆+ is a non-empty interval. Note that all special points of ϕ are contained in
RP 1, and that by deﬁnition, the endpoints of ∆+ are special points of ϕ. Choose an orientation
of RP 1 and enumerate the special points x1, . . . , xn+2 of ϕ with respect to this orientation so
that xi < xi+1 for i = 1, . . . , n + 1 and the endpoints of ∆+ are x1 and xn+2 (see Figure 1). We
also renumber the polynomials Pi so that xi is the root of Pi for i = 1, . . . , n + 2.

Figure 1.

The real dessin d’enfant associated to ϕ is Γ := ϕ−1(RP 1). The notations we use are taken
from [3] and for a more detailed description of real dessins d’enfant see [8, 12] for instance. The
dessin d’enfant Γ is a graph on CP 1 invariant with respect to the complex conjugation and which
contains RP 1. Any connected component of CP 1 \ Γ is homeomorphic to an open disk. Real
critical points of ϕ with real critical value are vertices of Γ. Moreover, each vertex of Γ has even
valency, and the multiplicity of a critical point with real critical value of ϕ is half its valency.
The graph Γ contains the inverse images of 0, ∞ and 1. The inverse image of 0 (resp. ∞) are
the roots of all Pi where λi are positive (resp. negative). Denote by the same letter p (resp. q
and r) the points of Γ which are mapped to 0 (resp. ∞ and 1). Orient the real axis on the target
space via the arrows 0 → ∞ → 1 → 0 (orientation given by the decreasing order in R) and pull
back this orientation by ϕ. The graph Γ becomes an oriented graph, with the orientation given
by arrows p → q → r → p. The graph Γ is called real dessin d’enfant associated to ϕ. A cycle
of Γ is the boundary of a connected component of CP 1\Γ. Any such cycle contains the same
non-zero number of letters r, p , q ordered by p → q → r → p (see Figure 2): we say that a
cycle obeys the cycle rule.

Figure 2. Cycles of Γ obeying the cycle rule.

Since the graph is invariant under complex conjugation, it is determined by its intersection
with one connected component H (for half) of CP 1 \ RP 1. In most ﬁgures we will only show
one half part H ∩ Γ together with RP 1 = ∂H represented as a horizontal line. Moreover, for
simplicity, we omit the arrows. Let a, b be two critical points of ϕ i.e. vertices of Γ. We say that
a and b are neighbors if there is a branch of Γ \ RP 1 joining them such that this branch does
not contain any special or critical points of ϕ other than a or b. In what follows, we assume that
ϕ(y) = 1 has n + 1 solutions contained in ∆+. Since the latter interval does not contain special
points of ϕ, by Rolle’s theorem, the function ϕ has at least n non-special critical points in ∆+,
and by Remark 3.1, the non-special critical points of ϕ (all n of them) are contained in ∆+.

Lemma 3.2. We have λiλi+1 < 0 for i = 1, . . . , n + 1.
Proof. Consider a couple xi, xi+1 of two consecutive special points of ϕ with i ∈ {1, . . . , n + 1}.
Then these two points are endpoints of an open interval in RP 1 which does not contain special
points or non-special critical points. By the cycle rule, this implies that one endpoint is a root
(cid:3)
(letter p) and the other is a pole (letter q) of ϕ.

We will assume that for i = 1, . . . , n + 2, we have λi > 0 if i is odd, and λi < 0 if i is even.

Lemma 3.3. The non-special critical points of ϕ cannot be neighbors to each other.
Proof. First, note that all special points of ϕ are contained in RP 1 \ ∆+. Consider the branch
of Γ contained in one of the connected components of CP 1 \RP 1 joining two non-special critical
points. Then one of the two connected components of CP 1 \ Γ adjacent to this edge will have a
(cid:3)
boundary disobeying the cycle rule.

Lemma 3.4. A special critical point of ϕ cannot be a neighbor to more than one non-special
critical point.

Proof. Assume that there exists a special critical point α of ϕ that is a neighbor to at least two
non-special critical points of ϕ (in RP 1). Let c1 and c2 be two such consecutive non-special
critical points. Consider two branches of Γ contained in one of the connected components of
CP 1 \ RP 1 joining α to c1 and α to c2 respectively. Then one of the two connected components
of CP 1 \ Γ adjacent to these two branches will have a boundary containing only α as a special
(cid:3)
point, and thus disobeying the cycle rule.

Lemma 3.5. The special points x1 and xn+2 of ϕ are not neighbors to any of the non-special
critical points.

Proof. Assume that x1 is a neighbor to a non-special critical point c (the case where xn+2 is a
neighbor to c is symmetric). Recall that ∆+ does not contain special points of ϕ. Consider the
branch of Γ contained in one of the connected components of CP 1 \ RP 1 joining x1 to c. Then
one of the two connected components of CP 1 \ Γ adjacent to this branch will have a boundary
(cid:3)
containing only x1 as a special point, and thus disobeying the cycle rule.

Recall that ϕ has n non-special critical points all contained in ∆+. Let c2, . . . , cn+1 denote

these points numbered so that xn+2 < cn+1 < cn < ··· < c2 < x1.
Proposition 3.6. For i = 2, . . . , n + 1, the special point xi is a neighbor to ci (see Figure 3).

Proof. First, by Lemma 3.5, we have that the roots of P1 and Pn+2 are not neighbors to non-
special critical points. Recall that there exists n non-special critical points in ∆+. Therefore,
by Lemmata 3.3 and 3.4, we have that for i = 2,··· , n + 1, the special point xi is a neighbor

CHARACTERIZATION OF CIRCUITS WITH MAXIMAL NUMBER OF POSITIVE SOLUTIONS

to only one non-special critical point cj. Consider the closed interval I ⊂ RP 1 with endpoints
xi and cj and which contains x1. The special points in I are x1, x2, . . . , xi and the non-special
critical points in I are c2, . . . , cj. Then the non-special critical points in I can only be neighbors
to special points in I \{x1} (see Lemma 3.5). This induces a bijection between {x2, . . . , xi} and
{c2, . . . , cj}, thus i = j.

Figure 3.

(cid:3)

Lemma 3.7. The special point x1 (resp. xn+2) of ϕ can only be a neighbor to the special point
x2 (resp. xn+1) of ϕ.

Proof. We prove the result only for x1 since the case for xn+2 is symmetric. Consider the open
interval I with endpoints c2 and x2 containing x1. By Proposition 3.6, we have that c2 and x2
are neighbors. The result comes as a consequence of Lemma 3.5 and of the fact that there does
(cid:3)
not exist special points or non-special critical points in I other than x1 (See Figure 4).

Lemma 3.8. For i = 1, . . . , n, the only special points which can be neighbors to xi+1 are xi and
xi+2.

Proof. Assume ﬁrst that i = 1 (the case i = n is symmetric). Recall that by Proposition 3.6, the
special point x2 (resp. x3) and c2 (resp. c3) are neighbors. Therefore, the only other possible
neighbors to x2 are x1 and x3 (see Figure 4).

Figure 4.

Assume now that i (cid:54)= 1 and i (cid:54)= n. Recall that by Proposition 3.6 the point xi (resp. xi+2) is
a neighbor to ci (resp. ci+2). Consider the disc C in CP 1 with boundary given by the union of
[ci+2, ci], [xi, xi+2] and the complex arcs of Γ joining ci to xi (resp. ci+2 to xi+2), and which are
contained in one given connected component of CP 1 \ RP 1 (see Figure 5). The result follows
from the fact that the only special points in C are xi and xi+2.

(cid:3)

Recall that λi is positive if i is odd and negative if i is even, and thus the root xi of Pi is a
zero (resp. pole) of ϕ if i is odd (resp. even). Recall that the valency of any special point xi is
the number Vi of edges of Γ that are incident to xi.

For i = 1, . . . , n+1, denote by Ni,i+1 the number of edges of Γ in CP 1\RP 1 joining the special
points xi and xi+1. By Lemmata 3.5 and 3.7, we have V1 = N1,2 + 2 and Vn+2 = Nn+1,n+2 + 2
(each number 2 corresponds to the pair of edges of Γ in RP 1 incident to x1 and xn+2 respectively).
Moreover, for i = 2, . . . , n+1, Proposition 3.6 and Lemma 3.8 show that Vi = Ni−1,i +Ni,i+1 +4,
where the number 4 counts the branches in RP 1 together with the branches joining xi to ci.
Knowing that Vi = |2λi|, it is straightforward to compute that for k = 1, . . . ,(cid:98)n/2(cid:99) + 1, we have

λ2j−1 < − k(cid:88)

This ﬁnishes the proof of the ”only if part” of Theorem 1.1.

We now ﬁnish the description of Γ. For i ∈ {0, . . . , n + 1}, consider the real branch L0 joining
two consecutive special points xi and xi+1 of ϕ. Let k := Ni,i+1/2, and for j = 1, . . . , k, consider
the couple of conjugate branches (Lj, Lj) joining xi to xi+1 enumerated such that the open
disc of CP 1 with boundary (Lj, Lj) and containing L0, contains the couple (Lj−1, Lj−1) as well
(assuming that L0 ≡ L0). The branch Lk (resp. Lk) does not contain a letter r since there
exists a cycle of Γ1 containing both Lk (resp. Lk) and a letter r ∈ ∆+, and thus obeying the
cycle rule. On the other hand, the branch Lk−1 (resp. Lk−1) contains a letter r where the cycle
formed by the union of Lk and Lk−1 (resp. Lk and Lk−1) and containing xi and xi+1 obeys the
cycle rule. We deduce that for j = 0, . . . , k, the branch Lj (resp. Lj) has exactly 1 or 0 letters
r according as j and k − 1 have the same parity or not (see Example 3.1).

In fact, this complete description of the dessin d’enfant Γ can be used to prove the ”if” part
of Theorem 1.1 with the same techniques as in [3]. However, we choose in Section 4 a diﬀerent
method, namely Viro’s combinatorial patchworking, which shows clearly why the inequalities of
Theorem 1.1 are necessary.

Remark 3.9. From the relations described above, we see that the collection of integers Ni,i+1
is determined by the collection of the coeﬃcients λi (and vice-versa). Moreover, we see that the
inequalities of Theorem 1.1 are equivalent to Ni,i+1 ≥ 0 for i = 1, . . . , n + 1.

complex branches connecting consecutive special points and letters r as described above.

Assume that λi > 0 if i is odd, λi < 0 if i is even and (3.3) or (3.4) is satisﬁed (depending
on the parity of n). In this section, we construct polynomials Pi (see Section 3) such that (3.1)
has n + 1 solutions in ∆+. These polynomials have the form P1,t(y) = tα1y, Pn+2,t(y) = 1 and
Pi,t(y) = 1 + tαiy for i = 2, . . . , n + 1, where t is a real positive parameter that will be taken
small enough, and each αi is a real number. The corresponding Gale polynomial (2.5) is

We now recall how one can recover in some cases the real roots of ft for t small enough (see

Its
lower hull L is the union of the edges e1, . . . , el of D whose inner normals have positive second
coordinate. Let Ii be the image of ei under the projection R2 → R forgetting the last coordinate.
Then the intervals I1, . . . , Il subdivide the Newton segment [p0, d] of ft. Let f (i) be the facial
subpolynomial of f for the face ei. That is, the polynomial f (i) is the sum of terms cp,qyp such
that (p, q) ∈ ei. Suppose that ei is the graph of y (cid:55)→ aiy + bi over Ii. Expanding ft(yt−ai)/tbi in
powers of t gives

(4.2)

ft(yt−ai)/tbi = f (i)(y) + g(i)(y, t)

and i = 1, . . . , l,

where g(i)(y, t) collects the terms whose powers of t are positive. Then f (i)(y) has Newton
segment Ii and its number of non-zero roots counted with multiplicities is |Ii|, the length of the
interval Ii.

Lemma 4.1. Assume that for i = 1, . . . , l, the polynomial f (i) is a binomial. Then there exists
a bijection between the set of all non-degenerate positive roots of ft for t > 0 small enough and
the set of non-degenerate positive roots of f (1), . . . , f (l).

Proof. Since f (i)(y) is a binomial, it has at most one positive root r which is simple, and there
will be a positive root ri,t of

f (i)(y) + g(i)(y, t)

near such r for t small enough. Let K ⊂ ]0, +∞[ denote a compact interval containing the
positive root of f (i) for i = 1, . . . , l. Then, for t > 0 small enough, the interval K contains the
positive root ri,t of ft(yt−ai)/tbi. Moreover, the intervals t−a1K, . . . , t−alK are disjoint for t > 0
small enough. This gives l positive roots of ft for t > 0 small enough. Roots of ft(yt−ai)/tbi
which are close to a point r are positive only if r is positive, and the number of these roots is
determined by the ﬁrst term f (i)(y). Since f (i)(y) is a binomial, it has only one simple positive
(cid:3)
root.

To simplify the notations, set p0 = 0, p1 = λ1, p2 = −λ2, p3 = λ1 + λ3, . . . and pn+1 =
λ2j if n is odd. Then by assumption, we have
p0 < p1 < ··· < pn+1. Set h0 = 0 and choose real numbers h1, . . . , hn+1 such that the lower part
L of the convex hull of {(pi, hi)| i = 0, . . . , n+1} consists of the segments [(pi, hi), (pi+1, hi+1)] for
i = 0, . . . , n. Therefore, projecting L to R via the map R2 → R forgetting the last coordinate,
we get the subdivision of [0, pn+1] by the intervals [pi, pi+1] (see Figure 8). Set α1 = h1/p1,
α2 = h2/p2 and

Proposition 4.2. For t > 0 small enough the polynomial (4.1) has n+1 roots in ∆+,t =]0, +∞[.

Proof. It is easy to see that the lower hull of the Viro polynomial

(4.3)

is composed of the segments [(p2j+1, h2j+1), (p2j+3, h2j+3)] for j = 0, . . . ,(cid:98)n/2(cid:99) − 1. Similarly,
the lower hull of

is composed of the segments [(p2j−2, h2j−2), (p2j, h2j)] for j = 1, . . . ,(cid:98)(n + 1)/2(cid:99).
It follows
that the lower hull of the Viro polynomial Gt is L. Now we apply Lemma 4.1 to Gt. For i =
0, . . . , n, the facial subpolynomial G(i) corresponding to the segment [(pi, hi), (pi+1, hi+1)] ⊂ L is
a binomial where one monomial comes from (4.3) and the other comes from (4.4). Consequently,
this binomial has coeﬃcients of diﬀerent signs and thus it has one simple positive root. Therefore
by Lemma 4.1, the polynomial Gt has n + 1 non-degenerate positive roots for t > 0 small
(cid:3)
enough.

Example 4.1. Choose for i = 0, . . . , n, the slope of the segment [(pi, hi), (pi+1, hi+1)] of L to
be equal to i. We compute explicitly the values α1, . . . , αn+1 of the exponent of t appearing

Since α1 = 0 and for i = 0, . . . , n − 1, we have αi+2 = (hi+2 − hi)/(pi+2 − pi), then
