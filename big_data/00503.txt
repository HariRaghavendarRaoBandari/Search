VEECH GROUPS OF INFINITE GENUS SURFACES

CAMILO RAMÍREZ MALUENDAS AND FERRÁN VALDEZ

ABSTRACT. We show that every countable subgroup G < GL+(2, R) without contracting ele-
ments is the Veech group of a tame translation surface S of inﬁnite genus, for inﬁnitely many
different topological types of S . Moreover, we prove that as long as every end has genus, there
are no restrictions on the topological type of S to realise all possible uncountable Veech groups.

INTRODUCTION

A surface S endowed with an atlas whose transition functions are translations is called a transla-
tion surface. To each such surface we can associate the group Aﬀ+(S) formed by all orientation-
preserving homeomorphisms of S which are afﬁne in local coordinates. It is easy to see that the
derivative of any afﬁne homeomorphism of S is constant, hence we have a well deﬁned map

Aﬀ+(S) D−→ GL+(2, R).

(1)
The main purpose of this article is the study of the image Γ(S ) of this map. When S is a compact
translation surface1 Γ(S ) lies in SL(2, R), is Fuchsian and hence acts on the hyperbolic plane by
Möbius transformations. In a milestone paper [Vee89], W.A. Veech proved the geodesic ﬂow
on a compact translation surface S for which Γ(S ) is a lattice behaves, roughly speaking, like
the geodesic ﬂow on a ﬂat torus. For this reason it is usual to call Γ(S ) the Veech group of
the surface S . Aside from questions regarding the dynamical properties of the geodesic ﬂow,
it is natural to investigate which subgroups of GL+(2, R) can be realised as Veech groups. For
compact translation surfaces, this is a difﬁcult question. Moreover, simpler instances of this
problem, as the existence of hyperbolic cyclic Veech groups, are still open.
In this paper we address the aforementioned realisation problem from the perspective of inﬁnite
type tame translation surfaces2. This kind of translation surfaces appears naturally when study-
ing irrational polygonal billiards [Val09] or inﬁnite coverings of compact translation surfaces
[Hoo12]. Given that translation surfaces are orientable, the topological type of an inﬁnite type
translation surface is determined by its genus g = g(S ) ∈ N ∪ {∞} and a couple of nested com-
pact, metrisable and totally disconnected spaces Ends∞(S ) ⊂ Ends(S ). Here Ends(S ) is the
space of ends of S and Ends∞(S ) is formed by those ends that carry (inﬁnite) genus. Recipro-
cally, every couple of nested closed subspaces of the Cantor set X∞ ⊂ X ⊂ 2ω can be realised

g ≥ 1.

1That is, when the metric completion of S with respect to the natural ﬂat metric is a compact surface of genus

2These are surfaces whose fundamental group is not ﬁnitely generated and whose natural ﬂat metric has only
singularities of (possibly inﬁnite) conic type. Compact translation surfaces are tame, but not all translation surfaces
of inﬁnite type are tame. We refer the reader to [BV13] for a general discussion on singularities of translation
surfaces.

as the space of ends and the space of ends with genus of some surface. The following result
describes in general terms what is to be expected from the Veech group of a tame translation
surface.
Theorem 0.1. [PSV11] The Veech group Γ(S ) of a tame translation surface is either:

(1) Countable and does not contain contracting elements, or
(2) Conjugated to P :=
(3) Conjugated to P(cid:48) < GL+(2, R), the subgroup generated by P and −Id, or
(4) Equal to GL+(2, R).

(cid:41)

It is not difﬁcult to see that condition 4 above implies that S is isometric to either the plane or
a ramiﬁed covering of the plane. Hence, it is natural to ask if all other expected groups can be
realised within the same topological class of an inﬁnite type tame translation surface:
Question 0.1. Let X∞ ⊂ X ⊂ 2ω be a nested couple of closed subspaces of the Cantor set. Is
it possible to realise any subgroup of GL+(2, R) satisfying (1), (2), or (3) in theorem 0.1 as the
Veech group of some tame translation surface S satisfying X∞ = Ends∞(S ) and X = Ends(S )?
For the simplest instance of this question X∞ = X = {∗} the answer is positive:
Theorem 0.2. (Ibid.) Any subgroup of GL+(2, R) satisfying (1), (2), or (3) in theorem 0.1 can
be realised as the Veech group of an inﬁnite genus tame translation with only one end.

The main contribution of this article is to show that question 0.1 has a positive answer for a large
topological class of inﬁnite type tame translation surfaces. For instance, in §2 we show that
within the topological class of inﬁnite type tame translation surfaces S for which Ends∞(S ) =
Ends(S ), there are no restrictions to realise uncountable Veech groups:
Theorem 0.3. Let X be any closed subset of the Cantor set and P, P(cid:48)
theorem 0.1. Then there exist tame translation surfaces S and S (cid:48) for which:

< GL+(2, R) be as in

• Ends(S ) = Ends∞(S ) = Ends(S (cid:48)) = Ends∞(S (cid:48)) = X
• the Veech groups of S and S (cid:48) are conjugated to P and P(cid:48), respectively.

The rest of the results we present deal with realising countable subgroups of GL+(2, R) with-
out contracting elements as Veech groups of inﬁnite type tame translation surfaces satisfying
Ends∞(S ) = Ends(S ). We present them according to the following heuristic picture: if one was
to order inﬁnite genus surfaces satisfying Ends∞(S ) = Ends(S ) according to their topological
complexity, the simplest surface would be the one for which the space of ends is just a single-
ton and the most sophisticated would be the one for which the space of ends is homeomorphic
to the Cantor set. These surfaces are called the Loch Ness Monster and the Blooming Cantor
Tree, respectively (see Figures 1 and 2). The nomenclature is due to Sullivan [PS81] and Ghys
[Ghy95].
Theorem 0.4. Let G < GL+(2, R) be any countable subgroup without contracting elements.
Then there exist a tame translation surface S homeomorphic to Blooming Cantor tree whose
Veech group is G.

In other words, question 0.1 has a positive answer if we move from the simplest topological
type of an inﬁnite genus surface without planar ends to the most sophisticated one. After this,
we show that for inﬁnitely many cases "in between" question 0.1 has also a positive answer.
Theorem 0.5. Let X be a countable closed subspace of the Cantor set with characteristic system
(k, 1) where k ∈ N ∪ {0}, and G < GL+(2, R) any countable subgroup without contracting
elements. Then there exists a tame translation surface S whose spaces of ends Ends∞(S ) =
Ends(S ) are homeomorphic to X and whose Veech group is G.
Recall that a countable compact Hausdorff space X has characteristic system (k, n) if its k-th
Cantor-Bendixon derivative, that we denote by Xk, is a ﬁnite set of n points [MS20]. We remark
that for k = 0, the statement of theorem 0.5 is the statement of theorem 0.2 for countable
subgroups of GL+(2, R) without contracting elements.
On the other hand, we know from the Cantor-Bendixson theorem that every uncountable closed
subset of the Cantor set 2ω is homeomorphic to a subset of the form B (cid:116) U ⊂ 2ω, where B is
homeomorphic to 2ω and U is countable and discrete.
Theorem 0.6. Let B (cid:116) U be an uncountable closed subset of the Cantor set, where B is home-
omorphic to the Cantor set and U is countable, discrete and its boundary ∂U is just one point.
Then for any countable subgroup G < GL+(2, R) without contracting elements there exist a
tame translation surface S whose spaces of ends Ends∞(S ) = Ends(S ) are homeomorphic to
B (cid:116) U and whose Veech group is G.

The proof of theorem 0.3 is largely inspired in the proof of theorem 0.2 found in [PSV11]
and a convenient characterisation of spaces of ends using binary trees that we introduce in the
next chapter. On the other hand, theorems 0.4, 0.5 and 0.6 are consequence of an abstract and
general construction that we call a puzzle and deﬁne in §3. As a matter of fact, some of the main
results found in [PSV11] can be deduced using this construction. Sadly, puzzles do not work
to give an answer to all possible instances of question 0.1. For example it is still unknown if
every countable subgroup G < GL+(2, R) can be realised as the Veech group of an inﬁnite type

translation surface S whose spaces of ends Ends∞(S ) = Ends(S ) contain only n ≥ 2 elements.
However, given the evidence provided by the results shown in this article we conjecture that
question 0.1 has always a positive answer.
Remark 0.1. All the translation surfaces constructed in this article will have inﬁnite area. We
believe that this hypothesis is crucial to answer question 0.1 positively. For ﬁnite area inﬁnite
type translation surfaces little is known about the Veech group, see for example [BV13].
Reader’s guide. In §1 we discuss the basic concepts needed to develop the proofs of our main
results. Namely, we recall the topological classiﬁcation of all orientable surfaces, the Cantor-
Bendixon derivative and the notion of a characteristic system. We also show that every closed
subset X of the Cantor set is the space of ends of a subgraph TX of an inﬁnite (binary) tree. In
particular, we introduce a decomposition of TX into a countable union of inﬁnite paths which
is crucial to the constructions we present. We ﬁnish this section by explaining the construction
of the "building block" used to deﬁne puzzles. In §2 we prove theorem 0.3. Finally, in §3 we
introduce the so called puzzles and show how theorems 0.4, 0.5 and 0.6 follow from the same
general construction.

1. PRELIMINARIES

We begin this section recalling the topological classiﬁcation of orientable surfaces, the Cantor-
Bendixon derivative and the notion of a characteristic system. We then introduce a model
for spaces of ends of surfaces based on subgraphs of an inﬁnite (binary) tree. We ﬁnish by
explaining the construction of the elementary piece that will be used in the next section to
deﬁne puzzles and give the proof of theorems 0.4, 0.5 and 0.6.

1.1. Topological classiﬁcation of surfaces. Through this text we will only work with ori-
entable surfaces S without boundary. It is a well know fact that any such surface with ﬁnitely
generated fundamental group is determined up to homeomorphism by its genus and number of
punctures. When the fundamental group of the surface is not ﬁnitely generated new topological
invariants, namely the spaces of ends of S , are needed to determine the surface up to homeo-
morphism. In what follows we review these invariants in detail, for they will be used in the
proof of our main results. For more details we refer the reader to [Ric63].
A pre-end of a connected surface S is a nested sequence U1 ⊃ U2 ⊃ ··· of connected open
subsets of S such that the boundary of Un in S is compact for every n ∈ N and for any compact
subset K of S there exist l ∈ N such that Ul∩ K = ∅. We shall denote the pre-end U1 ⊃ U2 ⊃ ···
n)n∈N are said to be equivalent if for any i ∈ N
as (Un)n∈N. Two such sequences (Un)n∈N and (U(cid:48)
j ⊂ Ui and viceversa. We denote by Ends(S ) the corresponding set of
exist j ∈ N such that U(cid:48)
equivalence classes and call each equivalence class [Un]n∈N ∈ Ends(S ) an end of S . We endow
Ends(S ) with a topology by specifying a pre-basis as follows: for any open subset W ⊂ S whose

VEECH GROUPS OF INFINITE GENUS SURFACES

5

boundary is compact, we deﬁne W∗ := {[Un]n∈N ∈ Ends(S ) : W ⊃ Ul for l sufﬁciently large}.
We call the corresponding topological space the space of ends of S.
Proposition 1.1. [Ric63, Proposition 3] The space of ends of a connected surface S is totally
disconnected, compact, and Hausdorff. In particular, Ends(S ) is homeomorphic to a closed
subspace of the Cantor set.

A surface is said to be planar if all of its compact subsurfaces are of genus zero. An end
[Un]n∈N is called planar if there exist l ∈ N such that Ul is planar. The genus of a surface
S is the maximum of the genera of its compact subsurfaces. Remark that if a surface S has
inﬁnite genus there exist no ﬁnite set C of mutually non-intersecting simple closed curves with
the property that S \ C is connected and planar. We deﬁne Ends∞(S ) ⊂ Ends(S ) as the set of
all ends of S which are not planar. It follows from the deﬁnitions that Ends∞(S ) forms a closed
subspace of Ends(S ).
Theorem 1.1 (Classiﬁcation of orientable surfaces). [Ker23, Chapter 5] Let S and S (cid:48) be two
orientable surfaces of the same genus. Then S and S (cid:48) are homeomorphic if only if both
Ends∞(S ) ⊂ Ends(S ) and Ends∞(S (cid:48)) ⊂ Ends(S (cid:48)) are homeomorphic as nested topological
spaces.

Of special interest in this paper is the surface of inﬁnite genus and only one end and the surface
without planar ends whose ends space is homeomorphic to the Cantor set. The former is known
as the Loch Ness Monster (Figure 1) and the latter as the Blooming Cantor tree (Figure 2). The
nomenclature is due to [PS81] and [Ghy95] respectively. Remark that a surface S has only one
end if only if for all compact subset K ⊂ S there exist a compact K(cid:48) ⊂ S such that K ⊂ K(cid:48) and
S \ K(cid:48) is connected, see [Spe49].
1.2. Cantor-Bendixson derivative. We recall brieﬂy Cantor-Bendixon’s theorem and how the
Cantor-Bendixon rank classiﬁes countable compact Polish spaces up to homeomorphism.
Theorem 1.2 (Cantor-Bendixson, [Kec94]). Let X be a Polish space. Then X can be uniquely
written as X = B (cid:116) U, where B is perfect and U is countable and open.
Corollary 1.1. Any uncountable Polish space contains a closed subset homeomorphic to the
Cantor set.
Given a topological space X, the Cantor-Bendixson derivate of X is the set X(cid:48) := {x ∈ X :
x is a limit point of X}. For every k ∈ N, the k-th Cantor-Bendixon derivative of X is deﬁned as
Xk := (Xk−1)(cid:48), where X0 = X. A countable Polish space is said to have characteristic system
(k, 1) if Xk (cid:44) ∅, Xk+1 = ∅ and the cardinality of Xk is exactly one.
Remark 1.1. Any countable Polish space with characteristic system (k, 1) is homeomorphic
to the ordinal number3 ωk + 1, where ω is the least inﬁnite ordinal. In particular, every two
countable Polish spaces with characteristic system (k, 1) are homeomorphic. For further details,
see [MS20].

The following results will be used in the proof of theorem 0.6.

3Recall that ordinal number can be made into a topological space by endowing it with the order topology.

Theorem 1.3. Let X1 = B1 (cid:116) U1 and X2 = B2 (cid:116) U2 be two uncountable closed subset of the
Cantor set. Suppose that both boundaries ∂U1 and ∂U2 are just singletons. Then X1 and X2 are
homeomorphic.

this action by:

By hypothesis there are homeomorphisms f j : B j →(cid:81)

is well a deﬁned bijection. We claim that F is the desired homeomorphism. Let V be an open
set in X2 containing F(∂U1) = ∂U2. There are open sets W1 and W2 in X1 containing the point
∂U1 such that f (W1∩B1) ⊂ V∩B2 and h(W2∩U1) ⊂ V∩U2. Then F(W1∩W2) ⊂ V. This proves
that function F is continuous at ∂U1. Since F is deﬁned by glueing homeomorphisms at this
point, this is sufﬁcient to prove that F is continuous. On the other hand, the function F is closed
because every continuous function from a compact and Hausdorff space onto a Hausdorff space
(cid:3)
is closed (see [Dug66, p.226]). Therefore F is a homeomorphism.
1.3. The Cantor Binary tree. One of the fundamental objects we use in the construction of
inﬁnite translation surfaces with prescribed Veech group is the inﬁnite 3-regular tree. This graph
plays a distinguished role for the space of ends of any surface is homeomorphic to a subspace
of its space of ends. We give binary coordinates to the vertex set of the inﬁnite 3-regular tree,
for we use these in a systematic way during the proofs of our main results.
i=1{0, 1}i} and πi : 2n → {0, 1} be the projection onto the
i-th coordinate. We deﬁne V := {Ds : Ds ∈ 2n for some n ∈ N} and E as the union of ((0), (1))
with the set {(Ds, Dt) : Ds ∈ 2n and Dt ∈ 2n+1 for some n ∈ N, and πi(Ds) = πi(Dt) for every
i ∈ {1, ..., n}}. The inﬁnite 3-regular tree with vertex set V and edges E will be called the Cantor
binary tree and denoted by T2ω, see Figure 3.
Remark 1.2. Let (vn)n∈N, vn ∈ 2ω be an inﬁnite simple path in T2ω. If we deﬁne Vn as the
connected component of T2ω \ {vn} such that vn+1 ∈ Vn, then [Vn] ∈ Ends(T2ω) is completely
{0, 1}i with the discrete and

determined by (vn)n∈N. Hence, if we endow {0, 1} and 2ω := (cid:81)

by the inﬁnite path (vn := (x1, . . . , xn))n∈N and the inﬁnite path (vn := (x1, . . . , xn))n∈N in T2ω.
Lemma 1.1. Let X be a closed subset of the Cantor set. Then there exist a connected subgraph
TX ⊂ T2ω such that its ends space Ends(TX) is homeomorphic to X.

Proof. Without loss of generality we suppose that X ⊂(cid:81)

The constructions of translations surfaces that we present follow at most a countable number
of steps. In order to integrate the graphs TX to these constructions it is important to be able to
express them as a countable union of inﬁnite paths which intersect at most at a vertex.
Example 1.1. Deﬁne T as the union of ((0), (1), (1, 1), (1, 1, 1), ...) and ((0), (0, 0), (0, 0, 0), ...)
with the countable set of inﬁnite paths:

{((Ds), (Ds, x), (Ds, x, x), (Ds, x, x, x), ...) ∈ T2ω : Ds ∈ 2n, x ∈ {0, 1}, and πn(Ds) (cid:44) x}n∈N,

then it is easy to see that T2ω :=(cid:83)

or intersect in just one vertex (see Figure 4).

Moreover, every two inﬁnite paths γ, γ(cid:48) ∈ TX intersect in at most one vertex.
Proof. Let us ﬁrst suppose that X is uncountable. By theorem 1.2, Ends(TX) = B (cid:116) U, where
B is homeomorphic to the Cantor set and U is a countable, discrete and open. If U = ∅, then
w.l.o.g. we can suppose that TX = T2ω and treat this case as in example 1.1. Let us suppose
then that U = {un}n∈N. By Lemma 1.1 we have

1.4. Translation surfaces and the Veech group. We recall some general aspects of translation
surfaces. For more details we refer the reader to [PSV11] and references within. A translation
surface is a real surface S whose transition functions are translations. Every translation surface

of S with respect to its natural ﬂat metric.

VEECH GROUPS OF INFINITE GENUS SURFACES

Deﬁnition 1.1. [PSV11] A translation surface S is called tame if for every point x ∈ (cid:98)S there
exist a neighborhood Ux ⊂(cid:98)S which is either isometric to some neighborhood of the Euclidean

9

plane or to the neighborhood of the branching point of a cyclic branched covering of the unit
disk in the Euclidean plane. In the later case we call x a cone angle singularity of angle 2nπ
if the cyclic covering is of (ﬁnite) order n ∈ N and an inﬁnite cone angle singularity when the
We denote by Sing (S ) ⊂(cid:98)S the set of cone angle singularities of S . A geodesic in S is called

singular if it has one endpoint in Sing (S ) and no singularities in its interior. A singular geodesic
having both endpoints in Sing (S ) is called a saddle connection. To every saddle connection γ
we can associate two holonomy vectors {v,−v} ⊂ R2 by developing the translation surface
structure along γ. Analogously, one can associate two unit vectors to every singular geodesic,
which we will also call holonomy vectors. Two saddle connections or singular geodesics are
said to be parallel if their corresponding holonomy vectors are parallel.
An afﬁne diffeomophism is a map f : S → S which is afﬁne on charts. We denote by Aﬀ+ (S )
the group of all orientation-preserving afﬁne diffeomorphisms. Given that S is a translation
surface, the differential of every element in Aﬀ+ (S ) is constant. Hence we have a well deﬁned
group morphism:

D : Aﬀ+(S ) → GL+(2, R),

where D( f ) is the differential matrix of f . The image of D, that we denote by Γ(S ) :=
D(Aﬀ+(S )), is called the Veech group of S , see [Vee89].
We ﬁnish this section by recalling that GL+(2, R) acts on the set of all translation surfaces by
post composition on charts. For every g ∈ GL+(2, R), we denote by S g := g·S and g : S Id → S g
the corresponding afﬁne diffeomorphism.
1.5. Auxiliary Constructions. In the following paragraphs we introduce some elementary
constructions needed to prove our main results. All these constructions are based on the same
principle: to glue translation surfaces along parallel marks. A mark m on a translation surface
S is ﬁnite length geodesic having no singular points in its interior. As with saddle connections,
we can associate to each mark two holonomy vectors by developing the translation structure
along them. Two marks on S are parallel if their respective holonomy vectors are parallel.
Deﬁnition 1.2 (Gluing marks). Let m and m(cid:48) be two disjoint parallel marks on a translation
surface S . We cut S along m and m(cid:48), which turns S into a surface with boundary consisting
of four straight segments. We glue this segments back using translations to obtain a tame
translation surface S (cid:48) different from the one we started from. We say that S (cid:48) is obtained from S
by regluing along m and m(cid:48).
We denote by m ∼glue m(cid:48) the operation of glueing the marks m and m(cid:48) and S (cid:48) = S /m ∼glue m(cid:48). In
Figure 5 we depict the glueing of two marks on the plane. Remark that the operation of glueing
marks can also be performed for marks on different surfaces. In any case, Sing S (cid:48) \ Sing S is
formed by two 4π cone angle singularities, that is, S tame implies S (cid:48) tame.

Proof. Given that family of marks M j does not accumulate in (cid:98)S j the quotient S is a tame
translation surface. Let K be a compact subset of S . We will show that there exists a compact
subset K ⊂ K(cid:48) ⊂ S such that S \ K(cid:48) is connected. By the remark done after theorem 1.1, this
implies that S has only one end. Let f : S 1 → S 2 be a homeomorphism such that f (m1

cutting along marks does not destroy genus, for each j ∈ {1, 2} the open surface S j \ M j with
(cid:3)
boundary of S j has inﬁnite genus and is naturally embedded in S .
Construction 1.1 (Elementary piece). Let X be a closed subset of the Cantor set, TX the sub-
graph of T2ω given by Lemma 1.1 and TX a countable family of inﬁnite paths as in Lemma 1.2.
Suppose that for each path γ ∈ TX we have a tame translation surface S (γ) homeomorphic to
not accumulate on the metric completion (cid:100)S (γ). Suppose that the vertex set of γ is labeled by
the Loch Ness Monster and a countable family of marks M := {mk : k ∈ N} ⊂ S (γ) which do
(vk = (x1, . . . , xk)) as in (3). For each k ∈ N we label the k-th mark mk of the family M with
vk ∈ γ and deﬁne the elementary piece associated to X and the family of translation surfaces
{S (γ)}γ∈TX as :
(7)
where ∼ is the equivalent relation given by glueing marks with the same labels.
Lemma 1.4. For every closed subset X of the Cantor set, S elem = S elem(X) is a tame translation
surface with Ends(S elem) = Ends∞(S elem) homeomorphic to X.
Proof. Tameness follows from two facts: any two inﬁnite paths in TX intersect in at most one

vertex and marks never accumulate on the metric completion (cid:100)S (γ). The rest of the proof goes
as follows. First we prove that Ends(S elem) is homeomorphic to X. The idea is to deﬁne an
embedding i : TX (cid:44)→ S elem and show that it induces a homeomorphisms between Ends(TX) and
Ends(S elem). Finally, we prove that S elem has no planar ends.
The embedding. Let [U(γ)n]n∈N be the end of S (γ). Up to making an isotopy on S (γ), for every
k ∈ N we can suppose that the marks {v1, . . . , vk} ⊂ S (γ) are contained in S (γ)\ U(γ)k. It is then
easy to see that there exists an inﬁnite simple embedded path δ : [0,∞) → S (γ) such that δ(0) is
an extremity of the mark labeled with the vertex v1, all marks M are contained in δ([0,∞]) and
δ−1(U(γ)k) = (n,∞). In other words, the image of δ goes only once over each mark5 and runs
into the only end of the surface. On the vertex set V(γ) = (vk)k∈N, we deﬁne iγ(vk) as the only
endpoint in the mark labeled with vk satisfying the following property: if iγ(vk)iγ(vk+1) is the
segment in the image of δ going from iγ(vk) to iγ(vk+1) and pk+1 is the endpoint on the mark vk+1
different from iγ(vk+1), then pk+1 ∈ iγ(vk)iγ(vk+1). We extend the map iγ to all edges by declaring
the image of the edge (vk, vk+1) to be iγ(vk)iγ(vk+1). This deﬁnes an embedding:

iγ : γ (cid:44)→ S (γ),

by declaring that the image of the edge (vk, vk+1) is precisely the subarc of δ joining iγ(vk) to
iγ(vk+1). Now consider two inﬁnite paths γ, γ(cid:48) ∈ TX sharing a vertex vk. This means that S (γ)

i : TX (cid:44)→ S elem,

and S (γ(cid:48)) are glued along the mark labeled with vk when constructing S elem. By the way we
deﬁned iγ and iγ(cid:48) we have that their images in S elem only intersect in iγ(vk) = iγ(cid:48)(vk). Therefore
we can glue the family of maps {iγ}γ∈TX to deﬁne an embedding:
(8)
Remark that in general we cannot use the set of paths in TX to characterise all points in Ends(TX)
because TX is always countable but Ends(TX)’s cardinality is the same as X’s, which may be
uncountable. To overcome this difﬁculty, let us deﬁne the family DX of descending paths of TX
as the set of all inﬁnite paths (Dn)n∈N of TX such that Dn ∈ 2n (see §1.3). Every descendent path
(Dn)n∈N deﬁnes an element [Un]n∈N ∈ Ends(TX) as follows: for every vertex Dn let Un ⊂ TX be
the connected componen of TX\ Dn containing Dn+1. This deﬁnes a bijection between Ends(TX)
and DX. We use the family of descending paths of TX to deﬁne a homeomorphism between
Ends(TX) and Ends(S elem).
Let (Dn)n∈N ∈ DX be the descending path determining [Un]n∈N ∈ Ends(TX). For each vertex Dn
we consider two cases:
0 ∈
N be the smallest positive integers such that iγα(Dn) (cid:60) U(γα)k0 ∈ [U(γα)k]k∈N and
∈ [U(γβ)k]k∈N. We deﬁne then Wn as the connected component of
iγβ(Dn) (cid:60) U(γβ)k(cid:48)
S elem \ ∂U(γα)k0 ∪ ∂U(γβ)k(cid:48)
(2) Suppose Dn ∈ γα ∈ TX but is not contained in any other inﬁnite path of TX. Let k0 be
the smallest positive integer such that iγα(Dn) (cid:60) U(γα)k0 ∈ [U(γα)k]k∈N. We deﬁne then
Wn as the connected component of S elem \ ∂U(γα)k0 containing i(Dn+1).

(1) Suppose that there exist two paths γα, γβ ∈ TX such that Dn ∈ γβ ∩ γα. Let k0, k(cid:48)

It is easy to check that the map

m = ∅, hence i∗([Un]n∈N) = [Wn]n∈N (cid:44) [W(cid:48)

This implies that Wm ∩ W(cid:48)
Surjectivity. Consider an end [Wn]n∈N of S elem. By the way the embedding (8) was deﬁned,
[i−1(Wn ∩ i(TX))] deﬁnes an end in TX. Let (Dn)n∈N ∈ DX be the descending path deﬁning
[i−1(Wn ∩ i(TX))] and [Un]n∈N = [i−1(Wn ∩ i(TX))]. Then i∗([Un]n∈N) = [Wn]n∈N.
The map i∗ is continuous. Let W ⊂ S elem be an open set with compact boundary and W∗ ⊂
Ends(S elem) the basic open set it deﬁnes in the space of ends. Since (8) is an embbeding, we
have that U := i−1(W ∩ TX) is an open set with compact boundary and i∗(U∗) ⊂ W∗.
The map i∗ is closed for it is a bijection from a compact Hausdorff space into a Hausdorff space.
Finally we remark that S elem has no planar ends for each piece S (γ) used in its construction has
(cid:3)
inﬁnite genus.

2. PROOF THEOREM 0.3

The proof that we present relies on construction 1.1 and lemma 1.4. First we deﬁne a tame
translation surface S P homeomorphic to the Loch Ness Monster whose Veech group is exactly

P. This surface comes with an inﬁnite family of marks which do not accumulate on the bound-
ary, hence we are in shape to perform construction 1.1 taking all S (γ) to be equal to S P and X
an arbitrary closed subset of the Cantor set. We then check that the Veech group of the resulting
elementary piece S elem is P. The case for P(cid:48) is treated analogously.
Construction 2.1. Consider E a copy of the Euclidean plane equipped with a ﬁxed origin 0 and
an orthogonal basis β = {e1, e2}. On E we deﬁne6 two inﬁnite families of marks:

L := {li = ((4i − 1)e1, 4ie1) : ∀i ∈ N} and, M := {mi = ((4i − 3)e1, (4i − 2)e1) : ∀i ∈ N}.

and the tame Loch Ness Monster (see Figure 7):

FIGURE 7. Tame Loch Ness Monster S P.

Given that {±e1} is the set of all holonomy vectors of S P and there are no saddle connections
on the half plane x < 0, the Veech group of S P is P. We remark that S P comes with the inﬁnite
family of marks M = {mk}k∈N, none of which has been glued to another mark.
Let X be a closed subset of the Cantor set and
S elem :=

be the tame translation surface obtained by performing construction 1.1 with initial data X and
all S (γ) equal to S P. By lemma 1.4, S elem has no planar ends and its ends space is homeomorphic
to X. Since all marks M in S P are parallel, all saddle connections in S elem are parallel as well.
Hence we can deﬁne for each g ∈ P an afﬁne diffeomorphism f on S P whose differential
is exactly g and which ﬁxes all points in the marks belonging to L and M. Since S elem is
obtained by glueing copies of S P along saddle connections, these afﬁne diffeomorphisms can
be glued together to deﬁne a global afﬁne diffeomorphism f ∈ Aﬀ+ (S elem) whose differential
is precisely g. In other words P is a subgroup of Γ(S elem). To see that Γ(S elem) is a subgroup of
P it is sufﬁcient to remark that there is only one horizontal direction deﬁning inﬁnite singular
geodesics in S elem and this direction has to be ﬁxed by the (linear) action of Γ(S elem) on the
plane. The construction of a tame translation surface having ends space homeomorphic to X
and Veech group equal to P(cid:48) done exactly as we did for P, except that instead of taking all copies
of S (γ) equal to S P we take them equal to the surface S P(cid:48) deﬁned in the following paragraph.

that its space of ends is homeomorphic to X.
Indeed, consider E the copy of the Euclidean plane described by the Construction 2.1 with only
the family of marks M and proceed verbatim as in case 1.

3. PROOF OF MAIN RESULTS

In this chapter we present the proofs of theorems 0.4, 0.5 and 0.6. These follow from a general
construction that we introduce in the ﬁrst section of this chapter.
3.1. Puzzles. Let (X, G, H) be a triple where X is a closed subset of the Cantor set, G is a
countable subgroup of GL+(2, R) without contracting elements generated7 by H. To the triple
(X, G, H) we will associate a family of tame translation surfaces P(X, G, H) = {S g : g ∈ G}.
This set will be called a puzzle and each of its elements a piece. As notation suggests, each
piece of the puzzle is an afﬁne copy of a ﬁxed tame translation surface, which will be called
the elementary piece of the puzzle for it is obtained through construction 1.1. The pieces S g of
the puzzle are endowed with families of marks that do not accumulate in the metric completion,
hence we can glue them together to form a tame translation surface S P that we will call the
assembled surface. The Veech group of the surface S P is G. Moreover, this surface satisﬁes
Ends(S P) = Ends∞(S P), and we will give an explicit description of this space of ends that will
allow us to prove, for different instances of X, theorems 0.4, 0.5 and 0.6.
The elementary piece of a puzzle. As it name suggest, this piece is obtained using construction
1.1. Recall that this construction has as initial data a closed subset X of the Cantor set and, for
each path γ in the countable family of paths TX given by lemma 1.2, a tame Loch Ness Monster
S (γ) endowed with an inﬁnite family of marks that do not accumulate. We build the surfaces

this purpose in mind, we choose an enumeration8 G := {g1, ..., g|G|} and H := {h1, ..., h|H|} for

Buffer Loch Ness Monster. For every h j ∈ H and g ∈ G we construct a tame translation
surface S (g, gh j) homeomorphic to the Loch Ness Monster. The purpose of these surfaces is
to separate singularities during the construction of S P, guaranteeing thus tameness. This idea
already appears in construction 4.4 in [PSV11].
For each element h j ∈ H, consider E( j, 1) and E( j, 2) two copies of the Euclidean plane equipped
with origins 0 and an orthogonal basis β = {e1, e2}. On E( j, 1) we draw the following two
families of marks:

Remark that by Lemma 1.3 the surface S (Id, h j) is a tame translation surface with inﬁnitely

That is, S (g, gh j) is the afﬁne copy of S (Id, h j) obtained by postcomposing every chart by
the afﬁne transformation associated to the matrix g. The family of marks ˇM j and h j ˇM− j on
S (g, gh j) are relabeled as g ˇM j and gh j ˇM− j, respectively. These marks will be used later to
construct S P. As said before, the purpose of the surfaces S (g, gh j) is to separate singularities
during the construction of S P, guaranteeing thus tameness. The following lemma is essential to
assure this property.

Decorated Loch Ness Monster. Using S (Id, h j) deﬁned above, we construct a tame translation
surface S homeomorphic to the Loch Ness Monster and having only one conic singularity of
angle 6π. This surface will be called the decorated Loch Ness Monster and its purpose is to
force the Veech group of S P to be exactly G. This idea also already appears in construction 4.6
in [PSV11].
Consider E a copy of the Euclidean plane equipped with an origin 0 and the same orthogonal
basis β = {e1, e2} as before. On E we draw the following families or marks:

Construction 3.1 (Elementary piece associated to puzzle P(X, G, H)). Consider X a closed
subset of the Cantor set, the graph TX with ends space homeomorphic to X given by Lemma 1.1
and TX the countable family of paths given by lemma 1.2 and decomposing TX. Pick an arbitrary
path ˜γ ∈ TX. We deﬁne S (˜γ) as a copy of the decorated Loch Ness Monster described above.
We endow this tame translation surface with the family of marks M (see preceding remark).
Clearly, the family M does not accumulate in the metric completion of S (˜γ). Moreover, for
each k ∈ N we label the k-th mark mk of the family M in S (˜γ) with the vertex vk ∈ ˜γ.
For each inﬁnite path γ in TX \{˜γ} we deﬁne S (γ) as a copy of the Loch Ness Monster described
in the Construction 2.1. By construction, each S (γ) is endowed with a countable family of
marks which, abusing notation, we also denote by M. These marks do not accumulate on the
metric completion. For each k ∈ N we label the k-th mark mk of the family M in S (γ) with the
vertex vk ∈ γ. The elementary piece associated to the puzzle P(X, G, H), which we denote by
S elem is deﬁned as the tame translation surface obtained by performing construction 1.1 on the

Deﬁnition 3.1 (Puzzle and assembled surface). Let X be a closed subset of the Cantor set, G a
countable subgroup of GL+(2, R) without contracting elements generated by H. For each g ∈ G

the linear transformation deﬁned by g. For each j ∈ {1, ...,|H|} we denote by gh j ˇM− j and gM− j
the families of marks on S g given by the image of the families of marks h j ˇM− j and M− j via the
afﬁne diffeomorphism g : S elem → S g (see §1.4). We deﬁne the puzzle associated to the triplet

Remark that the end ig([Un]n∈N) of S P is not planar. The following proposition describes the
space of ends of the assembled surface as a set.
Theorem 3.1. The assembled surface S P is a tame translation surface without planar ends and
its Veech group is G. Moreover:

We insist that the preceding is an equality in the category of sets, not in the category of topo-
logical spaces. In particular, this result says that all distinguished ends in the puzzle P(X, G, H)

merge into a single end {[(cid:101)Un]n∈N} when constructing S P. We will call this end the secret end of

S P.
Proof. We begin by showing that the assembled surface S P is tame. This follows from the
following two facts:
• The surface S P is a complete metric space11. Indeed, let (xn)n∈N ⊂ S P be a Cauchy
sequence. Lemma 3.1 implies that the cost (in distance inside S P) to scape from a piece

S g of the puzzle is at least
the closure (in S P) of the open subset:

1√
2. Hence, the sequence (xn) is eventually contained in the

U(g) := S g \

|H|(cid:91)
(gh j ˇM− j ∪ gM− j),

j=1

and this closure is, by construction, a complete metric subspace of S P.
• The set of singularities of S P is discrete in S P. This follows from lemma 3.1 and the
fact that the set of singularities at each piece S g of the puzzle is discrete.
We now proof that the Veech group of S P is G. For every g, g(cid:48) ∈ G there is a natural afﬁne
diffeomorphism fgg(cid:48) : S g → S g(cid:48)g whose differential is precisely g(cid:48). These transformations send
parallel marks to parallel marks, therefore one can glue all fgg(cid:48)’s together to induce an afﬁne
diffeomorphism in the quotient Fg(cid:48) : S P → S P whose differential is precisely g(cid:48). Since g(cid:48) was
arbitrary we have that G < Γ(S P). When constructing the elementary piece S elem we added in
purpose a decorated Loch Ness Monster so that S elem has only one 6π singularity x(Id) and only
three saddle connections γ1, γ2, γ3 issuing from it. Moreover, the holonomy vectors of these
saddle connections are {±e1,±e2}. This implies that every piece S g in the puzzle P(X, G, H)
has only one singularity x(g) of total angle 6π only three saddle connections γ1, γ2, γ3 issuing
from it. The holonomy vectors of these are {±g · e1,±g · e2}. On the other hand suppose that an
afﬁne diffeomorphism f ∈ Aﬀ+(S P) sends x(Id) ∈ S elem = S Id to x(g). Its derivative D f must
then send {±e1,±e2} to {±g · e1,±g · e2} and have positive determinant. The only possibility is
D f = g, therefore Γ(S ) < G.
We address now equation (19). Given that this is the most technical part of the proof we divide
our approach in three steps:
I. For any two different elements g (cid:44) g(cid:48) in G we have that the embeddings deﬁned in (18) have
disjoint images:

tive WN which does not intersect any of the buffer surfaces in the decorated Loch Ness Monster
forming S g. Since path from S g to S g(cid:48) has to go through one of these buffer surfaces, there
exists a representative ZM such that WN ∩ ZM = ∅. Therefore the ends [Wn]n∈N and [Zn]n∈N are
disjoint in Ends(S P).

To ﬁnish the proof remark that, by construction, all ends in (19) have inﬁnite genus.

3.2. Proof of the Theorem 0.4. Let 2ω denote the Cantor set and consider the puzzle P(2ω, G, H).
Following theorem 3.1, it is sufﬁcient to prove that Ends(S P) has no isolated points. Let then
W∗ be an open neighbourhood of [Un]n∈N ∈ Ends(S P). From equation (19) we have two cases
to consider. First, suppose that there exist g ∈ G such that [Un]n∈N ∈ ig(Ends(S g)\{[Ug

this case there exist an open subset V of S P with compact boundary such that Ul ⊂ V ⊂ W ∩ S g.
[Un]n∈N is not empty. Now suppose that [Un]n∈N is equivalent to the secret end [(cid:101)Un]n∈N. We know

3.3. Proof of the Theorem 0.5. Consider the ordinal number ωk + 1, for a ﬁxed k ∈ N. Fol-
lowing theorem 3.1 it is sufﬁcient to prove that Ends(S P) is homeomorphic to ωk + 1. Roughly
speaking the idea of the proof is the following: ﬁrst we choose properly the path ˜γ in construc-
tion 3.1, so that the k-th iterate of the Cantor-Bendixon derivative on Ends(S g) is precisely the

distinguished end [Ug
particular case, we will deﬁne a countable topological space Yk. Finally, we will prove that
Ends(S P) is homeomorphic to Yk and that the characteristic system of Yk is precisely (k, 1).
Fix a topological embedding ωk + 1 (cid:44)→ Ends(T2ω), let Tωk+1 be the graph with ends space
homeomorphic to ordinal number ωk + 1 given by lemma 1.1 and Tωk+1 the countable family of
paths given by lemma 1.2. Given that ωk + 1 is countable, the sets Ends(Tωk+1) and Tωk+1 are in

bijection (see corollary 1.2). Let then ˜γ ∈ Tωk+1 be the inﬁnite path corresponding to the only
point left in Ends(Tωk+1) after the k-th iteration of the Cantor-Bendixon derivative. We perform
then construction 3.1 of the elementary piece of the Puzzle P(ωk +1, G, H) choosing the inﬁnite
path ˜γ ∈ Tωk+1, associated to the decorated Loch Ness Monster, as above. With this choice we
assure that the k-th iteration of the Cantor-Bendixon derivative on the space of ends of every

We claim that the characteristic system of Yk is (k, 1). To see this ﬁrst remark that for each
g ∈ G, the copy ωk
g of ωk ﬁguring in the right-hand side of (22) is (topologically) embedded
in Yk. On the other hand, given that ωk is not a limit ordinal, y is a limit point of the subset
(cid:116)g∈Gωk
g. These two facts combined imply that the set of accumulation points of Yk is precisely
Yk−1 for every k ≥ 2 and just the singleton {y} when k = 1. Hence the (k − 1)-th iteration of the
Cantor-Bendixon derivative on Yk yields Y1, which has characteristic system (1, 1). This implies
that the characteristic system of Yk is precisely (k, 1) and the proof is complete.

3.4. Proof of Theorem 0.6. Following theorem 3.1, it is sufﬁcient to prove that Ends(S P) is
homeomorphic to B (cid:116) U, where by hypothesis B is homeomorphic to the Cantor set and U is
a countable discrete set of points such that ∂U = u ∈ B. As in the proof of theorem 0.5, we
deal ﬁrst with P(B(cid:116) U, G, H)’s elementary piece. From corollary 1.3 we know that there exists
a path ˜γ ∈ TB(cid:116)U that deﬁnes the end of TB(cid:116)U corresponding to u, the boundary of U in B (cid:116) U.
We perform construction 3.1 of the elementary piece taking the decorated Loch Ness Monster
as S (˜γ), where ˜γ is chosen just as mentioned before. This way, for every g ∈ G we have that
Ends(S g) = Bg (cid:116) Ug, with Bg homeomorphic to the Cantor set, Ug discrete, countable and
n]n∈N. On the other hand, given that for every g ∈ G
∂Ug is equal to the distinguished end [Ug
the map ig : Ends(S g) \ {[Ug
n]n∈N} → Ends(S P) deﬁned in (18) is an embedding, Ends(S P) is
uncountable and:
(24)
By the Cantor-Bendixon theorem 1.2, we can write Ends(S P) = BP (cid:116) UP, where BP is homeo-
morphic to the Cantor set and UP is discrete and countable. From theorem 1.3 it is sufﬁcient to
show that ∂UP is just a point to ﬁnish the proof. We achieve this in what follows.
