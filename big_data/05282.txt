Abstract. We use a variant of the fountain Theorem to prove the exis-
tence of inﬁnitely many weak solutions for the following fractional p-Laplace
equation

(−∆)s

pu + V (x)|u|p−2u = f (x, u) in RN ,

where s ∈ (0, 1), p ≥ 2, N ≥ 2, (−∆)s
p is the fractional p-Laplace operator,
the nonlinearity f is p-superlinear at inﬁnity and the potential V (x) is
allowed to be sign-changing.

1. Introduction

In this paper we are interested in the study of the nonlinear fractional p-
Laplacian equation:

(−∆)s

pu + V (x)|u|p−2u = f (x, u) in RN ,

(1.1)

where s ∈ (0, 1), p ≥ 2 and N ≥ 2.

More recently, a new nonlocal and nonlinear operator was considered, namely
the fractional p-Laplacian. In the works of Franzina and Palatucci [9] and of
Lindgren and Linqvist [14], the eigenvalue problem associated with (−∆)s
p is
studied, in particular some properties of the ﬁrst eigenvalue and of the higher
order eigenvalues are obtained. Torres [16] established an existence result for
the problem (1.1) when f is p-superlinear and subcritical. Iannizzotto et al.
[11] investigated existence and multiplicity of solutions for a class of quasi-
linear nonlocal problems involving the p-Laplacian operator.
Motivated by the above papers, we aim to study the multiplicity of nontrivial
weak solutions to (1.1).
Here we require that the potential V (x) satisﬁes the following assumptions:
(V1) V ∈ C(RN ) is bounded from below;
(V2) There exists r > 0 such that

lim
|y|→∞

|{x ∈ RN : |x − y| ≤ r, V (x) ≤ M}| = 0

for any M > 0,

while the nonlinearity f : RN ×R → R and its primitive F (x, t) = Z t

0

f (x, z) dz

are such that
(f1) f ∈ C(RN × R), and there exist c1 > 0 and p < ν < p∗

s such that

|f (x, t)| ≤ c1(|t|p−1 + |t|ν−1) ∀(x, t) ∈ RN × R,
N −sp if sp < N and p∗

s = ∞ for sp ≥ N.
(f2) F (x, 0) ≡ 0, F (x, t) ≥ 0 for all (x, t) ∈ RN × R and

where p∗

s = N p

lim
|t|→∞

F (x, t)
|t|p = +∞.

(f3) There exists θ ≥ 1 such that

θF (x, t) ≥ F (x, τ t) ∀(x, t) ∈ RN × R and τ ∈ [0, 1]

where F (x, t) = tf (x, t) − pF (x, t).

(f4) f (x, −t) = −f (x, t) for all (x, t) ∈ RN × R.
Examples of V and f satisfying the above assumptions are

V (x) = (cid:26) 2n|x| − 2n(n − 1) + c0

−2n|x| + 2n2 + c0

if n − 1 ≤ |x| ≤ (2n − 1)/2
if (2n − 1)/2 ≤ |x| ≤ n (n ∈ N and c0 ∈ R)

,

and

f (x, t) = a(x)|t|p−2t ln(1 + |t|) ∀(x, t) ∈ RN × R,

where a(x) is a continuous bounded function with positive lower bound.
Our main result can be stated as follows.

Theorem 1. Assume that f satisﬁes (f 1) − (f 4) and V satisﬁes (V 1) − (V 2).
Then the problem (1.1) has inﬁnitely many nontrivial weak solutions.

Remark 1. The assumptions (V 1) and (V 2) on the potential V and (f 1)-(f 4)
with p = 2 and s = 1, have been used in [17] to extend a known multiplicity
result due to Bartsch and Wang [2]. For this reason, we would note that
Theorem 1, can be seen as the nonlocal counterpart of Theorem 1.1 in [17].

In order to prove Theorem 1, we will consider the following family of functionals

Jλ(u) =

p (cid:20)ZZR2N

|u(x) − u(y)|p

|x − y|N +sp dxdy +ZRN

V (x)u2(x)dx(cid:21)−λZRN

F (x, u) dx,

with λ ∈ [1, 2] and u ∈ E, where

E = (cid:26)u ∈ W s,p(RN ) : ZRN

V (x)|u(x)|pdx < ∞(cid:27) ,

and we will show that Jλ satisﬁes the assumptions of the following variant of
fountain Theorem due to Zou [18]:

Theorem 2. [18] Let (E, ||·||) be a Banach space, E = ⊕j∈NXj, with dim Xj <
∞ for any j ∈ N. Set Yk = ⊕k
j=kXj. Let Jλ : E → R a
family of C 1(E, R) functionals deﬁned by

j=1Xj and Zk = ⊕∞

Jλ(u) = A(u) − λB(u),

λ ∈ [1, 2].

Assume that Jλ satisﬁes the following assumptions:

(i) Jλ maps bounded sets to bounded sets uniformly for λ ∈ [1, 2], Jλ(−u) =

Jλ(u) for all (λ, u) ∈ [1, 2] × E.

(ii) B(u) ≥ 0 for all u ∈ E, and A(u) → ∞ or B(u) → ∞ as ||u|| → ∞.
(iii) There exists rk > ρk such that

βk(λ) = max

u∈Yk,||u||=rk

Jλ(u) < αk(λ) =

Moreover, for a.e. λ ∈ [1, 2], there exists a sequence {uk
that

Remark 2. By using (V 1) we know that there exists V0 > 0 such that V1(x) =
V (x) + V0 ≥ 1 for any x ∈ RN . Let f1(x, t) = f (x, t) + V0|t|p−2t for all
(x, t) ∈ RN × R. Then it is easy to verify that the study of (1.1) is equivalent
to investigate the following problem

(−∆)s

pu + V1(x)|u|p−2u = f1(x, u) in RN .

From now on, we will assume that V (x) ≥ 1 for any x ∈ RN in (V 1).

2. Preliminaries and functional setting

In this preliminary Section, for the reader’s convenience, we recall some basic
results related to the fractional Sobolev spaces. For more details about this
topic we refer to [6].
Let u : RN → R be a measurable function. We say that u belongs to the space
W s,p(RN ) if u ∈ Lp(RN ) and

W s,p(RN ) := ZZR2N
[u]p

|u(x) − u(y)|p
|x − y|N +sp dxdy < ∞.
Then W s,p(RN ) is a Banach space with respect to the norm
W s,p(RN )]1/p.

||u||W s,p(RN ) = [||u||p

Lp(RN ) + [u]p

Now we recall the main embeddings results for this class of fractional Sobolev
spaces:

Theorem 3. [6] Let s ∈ (0, 1) and p ∈ [1, ∞) be such that sp < N. Then
there exists C = C(N, p, s) > 0 such that

|u|Lp∗

s (RN ) ≤ C||u||W s,p(RN ).

for any u ∈ W s,p(RN ). Moreover the embedding W s,p(RN ) ⊂ Lq(RN ) is locally
compact whenever q < p∗
s.
If sp = N then W s,p(RN ) ⊂ Lq(RN ) for any q ∈ [p, ∞).

If sp > N then W s,p(RN ) ⊂ C

0, sp−N
loc

p

(RN ).

Now we give the deﬁnition of weak solution for the problem (1.1).
Taking into account the presence of the potential V (x), we introduce the fol-
lowing fractional space

E = (cid:26)u ∈ W s,p(RN ) : ZRN

V (x)|u(x)|pdx < ∞(cid:27)

endowed with the norm

||u|| := ||u||E = (cid:18)[u]p

W s,p(RN ) +ZRN

V (x)|u(x)|pdx(cid:19)1/p

.

Let us denote by (E∗, || · ||∗) the dual space of (E, || · ||).
We deﬁne the nonlinear operator A : E → E∗ by setting

hA(u), vi = ZZR2N

|u(x) − u(y)|p−2(u(x) − u(y))

|x − y|N +sp

(v(x)−v(y)) dxdy+ZRN

V (x)|u|p−2uv dx,

for u, v ∈ E. Here h·, ·i denotes the duality pairing between E and E∗.
Let

B(u) = ZRN

F (x, u)dx

for u ∈ E, and we set J (u) = 1

phA(u), ui − B(u) for u ∈ E.

Deﬁnition 1. We say that u ∈ E is a weak solution to (1.1) if u satisﬁes

for all v ∈ E.

hA(u), vi = hB′(u), vi

Now we prove that the following compactness result holds.

Lemma 1. Under the assumption (V 1) and (V 2), the embedding E ⊂ Lq(RN )
is compact for any q ∈ [p, p∗

s).

Proof. We follow the proof of Lemma 3.1 in [3] to verify the claim.
Let {un} ⊂ E such that un ⇀ 0 in E. We have to show that un → 0 in Lq(RN )
for q ∈ [p, p∗
s). By the interpolation inequality we only need to consider q = p.
By using the Theorem 3 we know that un → 0 in Lp
loc(RN ). Thus it suﬃces to
show that, for any ǫ > 0, there exists R > 0 such that

ZBc

R(0)

|un|p dx < ǫ;

R(0) = RN \ BR(0).

here Bc
Let {yi}i∈N be a sequence of points in RN satisfying RN ⊂ ∪i∈NBr(yi) and such
that each point x is contained in at most 2N such balls Br(yi). We recall that
we are assuming V (x) ≥ 1 for any x ∈ RN .
Let

AR,M = {x ∈ Bc

R : V (x) ≥ M}

and BR,M = {x ∈ Bc

R : V (x) < M}.

Then

ZAR,M

|un|p dx ≤

and this can be made arbitrarily small by choosing M large.
Take γ > 1 such that pγ ≤ p∗

Finally we recall the following result proved in [16] which we will use later

Lemma 2. [16] If un ⇀ u in E and hA(un), un − ui → 0 then un → u in E.

Let us introduce the following family of functional Jλ : E → R deﬁned by

Jλ(u) =

1
p

hA(u), ui − λB(u),

λ ∈ [1, 2].

By (V 1) and (f 1) follows that Jλ is well deﬁned on E and of class C 1. More-
over, the derivative of Jλ is given by

J ′

λ(u)v = hA(u), vi − λhB′(u), vi,

(2.1)

where

hB′(u), vi = ZRN

f (x, u)vdx.

Then the critical points of J1 = J are weak solutions to (1.1).
0 (RN )
In order to apply the Theorem 2 we can observe that E is a separable (C ∞
is separable and dense in W s,p(RN )) and reﬂexive Banach space, so there
exist (φn) ⊂ E and (φ∗
n) ⊂ E∗ such that E = span{φn : n ∈ N}, E∗ =
span{φ∗
Then, for any n ∈ N, we set Xn = span{φn}, Yn = ⊕n

n : n ∈ N} and hφn, φmi = 1 if n = m and zero otherwise.

3. Proof of Theorem 1

In this section we give the proof of the main result of this paper.
Firstly we prove the following Lemmas:

MULTIPLE SOLUTIONS FOR A FRACTIONAL p-LAPLACIAN EQUATION

Lemma 3. Assume that V satisﬁes (V 1)-(V 2) and that f satisﬁes (f 1). Then
there exists k1 ∈ N and a sequence ρk → ∞ as k → ∞ such that

αk(λ) =

inf

u∈Zk,||u||=ρk

Jλ(u),

∀k ≥ k1.

Proof. After integrating, we obtain from (f 1) that for any (x, t) ∈ RN × R

|F (x, t)| ≤

|t|p +

|t|ν ≤ c1(|t|p + |t|ν).

Let us deﬁne

Now we prove that

bp(k) =

|u|p

u∈Zk,||u||=1

bν(k) =

sup

|u|ν.

u∈Zk,||u||=1

bp(k) → 0 and bν(k) → 0 as k → ∞.

(3.2)

It is clear that bp(k) and bν(k) are decreasing with respect to k so there exist
bp, bν ≥ 0 such that bp(k) → bp and bν(k) → bν as k → ∞. For any k ≥ 0,
there exists uk ∈ Zk such that ||uk|| = 1 and |uk|p ≥ bp(k)
2
Taking into account that E is reﬂexive and by using the deﬁnition of Zk, we
deduce that uk ⇀ 0 in E. Since E is compactly embedded in Lp(RN ) by
Lemma 1, we have uk → 0 in Lp(RN ), which implies that bp = 0. Similarly we
can prove that bν = 0.
Then, for any u ∈ Zk and λ ∈ [1, 2], we can see that

Lemma 4. Assume that (V 1), (V 2), (f 1) and (f 2) hold. Then for the positive
integer k1 and the sequence ρk obtained in Lemma 3, there exists rk > ρk for
any k ≥ k1 such that

βk(λ) = max

u∈Yk,||u||=rk

Jλ(u) < 0.

Proof. Firstly we prove that for any ﬁnite dimensional subspace F ⊂ E there
exists a constant δ > 0 such that

|{x ∈ RN : |u(x)| ≥ δ||u||}| ≥ δ,

∀u ∈ F \ {0}.

We argue by contradiction and we suppose that for any n ∈ N there exists
0 6= un ∈ F such that

Let vn := un

||un|| ∈ F for all n ∈ N. Then ||vn|| = 1 for all n ∈ N and

(3.4)

Up to a subsequence, we may assume that vn → v in E for some v ∈ F since
F is a ﬁnite dimensional space. Clearly ||v|| = 1. By using Lemma 1 and the
fact that all norms are equivalent on F , we deduce that

Since v 6= 0, there exists δ0 > 0 such that

|vn − v|p → 0 as n → ∞.

Set

and for all n ∈ N,

|{x ∈ RN : |v(x)| ≥ δ0}| ≥ δ0.

we can ﬁnd δk > 0 such that

|{x ∈ RN : |u(x)| ≥ δk||u||}| ≥ δk,

∀u ∈ Yk \ {0}.

By using (3.1) and Lemma 1 we can see that Jλ maps bounded sets to bounded
sets uniformly for λ ∈ [1, 2]. Moreover, by (f 4), Jλ is even. Then the condition
(i) in Theorem 2 is satisﬁed. The condition (ii) is clearly true, while (iii)
follows by Lemma 3 and Lemma 4.

Since (3.12) hold true, for any j ∈ N, we can choose rj = (2jp)1/pwn such that
(3.15)

rj||un||−1 ∈ (0, 1)

provided n is large enough. By (3.13), F (·, 0) = 0 and the continuity of F , we
can see

F (x, rjwn) → F (x, rjw) = 0 a.e. x ∈ RN

(3.16)
as n → ∞ for any j ∈ N. Then, taking into account (3.1), (3.13), (3.16), (f 2)
and by using the Dominated Convergence Theorem we deduce that

F (x, rjwn) → 0 in L1(RN )

(3.17)

as n → ∞ for any j ∈ N. Then (3.14), (3.15) and (3.17) yield

Jλn(tnun) ≥ Jλn(rjwn) ≥ 2j − λnZRN

F (x, rjwn)dx ≥ j

provided n is large enough and for any j ∈ N. As a consequence

Jλn(tnun) → ∞ as n → ∞.

(3.18)

Since Jλn(0) = 0 and Jλn(un) ∈ [ck, dk], we deduce that tn ∈ (0, 1) for n large
enough. Thus, by (3.14) we have

hJ ′

λn(tnun), tnuni = tn

Jλn(tun) = 0.

(3.19)

Taking into account (f 3), (3.19) and (2.1) we get

λn(un), uni = Jλn(un)

which contradicts (3.11) and (3.18).
Secondly, assume that

(3.20)
Thus the set Ω := {x ∈ RN : w(x) 6= 0} has positive Lebesgue measure. By
using (3.12) and (3.20) we have

w 6≡ 0.

|un(x)| → ∞ a.e. x ∈ Ω as n → ∞.

(3.21)

Combining (3.13), (3.21), and (f 2), by Fatou’s Lemma, we can easily deduce
that

which is in contradiction with (3.11).
Then, we have proved that the sequence {un} is bounded in E.

(cid:3)

Now we are able to provide the proof of Theorem 1:

Proof of Theorem 1. In view of Lemma 6 and (3.11), for each k ≥ k1, using
the similar arguments in the proof of Lemma 5, we can also show that the
sequence {uk
n} has a strong convergent subsequence with the limit uk being
just a critical point of J = J1. Clearly, J (uk) ∈ [ck, dk] for all k ≥ k1.
Since ck → ∞ as k → ∞ in (3.8), we obtain inﬁnitely many nontrivial critical

points of J . As a consequence, we can deduce that (1.1) possesses inﬁnitely
many nontrivial weak solutions.
