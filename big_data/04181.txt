Abstract

The coarsening behavior of bubbles is studied by molecular dynamics simulations. The kinetic

equation, which denotes the growth or shrinkage rate of a bubble, is directly observed. The

form of the kinetic equation is consistent with the prediction by the classical Lifshitz-Slyozov-

Wagner (LSW) theory for the reaction-limited case. The distribution function of bubbles are well

reproduced from the obtained kinetic equation. This means that the scaling hypothesis of the

LSW holds well. While everything is consistent with the LSW theory when the temperature of

the system is suﬃciently low, the kinetic equation is found to be multivalued function for higher

temperature regime, and therefore, the mean-ﬁeld like treatment can fail in this regime.

INTRODUCTION

When a thermodynamic variable, such as temperature or pressure, is quickly changed,

a single phase system becomes unstable and the system is forced to put into a two-phase

system. Then nucleation, growth, and coarsening are observed. These phenomena are

very common and widely observed in any systems involving the ﬁrst-order transition. The

coarsening, also termed Ostwald ripening, is the process that larger droplets become larger

at the expense of smaller ones. The basic theory of the coarsening was constructed by

Lifshitz and Slyozov [1] and Wagner [2] and the theory is now referred to the LSW theory.

Since the LSW theory is a kinds of the mean-ﬁeld theory, the dynamics of the system is

determined by a behavior of a single droplet. The behavior is described by an equation

denoting the time and volume dependency of the growth rate of droplets and this equation

is called the kinetic equation. Assuming the self-similarity, the LSW theory predicts the

form of the distribution function in the late stage of coarsening. After the publication of

the LSW theory, many experiments have been performed to verify the theory. While the

self-similarity is widely conﬁrmed, the distribution function is generally broader than the

theoretical predictions [3–5]. One of the accused for the discrepancy is the assumption of

the low volume fraction. While a considerable eﬀorts have been made to extend the LSW

theory beyond the mean-ﬁeld treatments [6–11], the problem remains unsolved. One of the

diﬃculties of this problem is that it is diﬃcult to observe the kinetic equation directly. One

has to assume the form of the kinetic equation, and then predicts the form of the distribution

function within the framework of the LSW theory. If there is a discrepancy between the

predicted and the observed distribution function, one can infer that the assumed kinetic

equation does not describe the real kinetics. However, one cannot know why and how

the assumed kinetic equation deviates from the real one. Recently, Werz et al. investigates

coarsening of particles in the Al-Cu system [12]. Owing to the improvements of the resolution

of the X-ray tomography, they succeeded to track individual particles with submillimeter

size, and determined the growth rate directly. They reported that the obtained growth

rate, which is the kinetic equation, is signiﬁcantly deviated from the prediction of the LSW

theory.

While many experimental and numerical studies have been performed on coarsening of

the solid phase, very little attention has been paid to coarsening of bubbles, especially one-

2

component ﬂuid systems. Since interactions between bubbles in ambient liquid is expected to

be much stronger than those of particles in solid, the discrepancy between the theory and the

observation can be more severe. Recently, we studied the coarsening behavior of bubbles [13].

In contrast with our expectation, the LSW theory described the bubble coarsening well

without any modiﬁcations. We found that (i) the total number of bubbles showed the power-

law decrease as t−x, (ii) the bubble-size distribution functions showed the self-similarity, and

(iii) the value of the power-law exponent changes from x = 3/2 to 1 as temperature increases.

From the value of the exponent, the low and high temperature regimes were expected to

exhibit the reaction-limited and the diﬀusion-limited growth, respectively. However, it was

diﬃcult to determine whether the microscopic dynamics was really determined by reaction

only from the information of the distribution functions. Therefore, more detailed analyses

are required to investigate the kinetics of bubbles. The purpose of the present paper is to

investigate microscopic dynamics of bubble coarsening and to identify the bottle-neck of the

dynamics directly with the help of the huge-scale molecular dynamics simulations.

This paper is organized as follow. A brief summary of the theoretical background is given

in Sec. II. Section. III is devoted to describe the method, especially how to determine the

kinetic equation from the simulation data. The obtained results are presented in Sec. IV.

Finally, Sec. V concludes the present paper with discussions.

II. THEORY

We start from a distribution function f (v, t) that denotes a number of bubbles having

volume v at time t. In the following, we use the volume of a bubble as a variable for later

convenience while a radius is usually used as a variable in past studies. Also, we consider

only a three-dimensional system for the simplicity, since a two-dimensional system involves

logarithmic behavior [14, 15]. The time evolution of the system is governed by the following

equation of continuity:

∂f
∂t

= −

∂
∂v

( ˙vf ) ,

(1)

where ˙v(v, t) is the kinetic equation denoting the growth or shrinkage rate of a bubble having

volume v at time t. Here, we assume the mean-ﬁeld like nature, i.e., all bubbles in the system

feel the identical ambient pressure. This assumption corresponds to the fact that the kinetic

equation is single-valued. We also assume that the kinetic equation is a continuous function

3

which means that there are no discontinuous jumps in volume of bubbles due to nucleation

or coalescence. In the coarsening process, the critical volume vc(t) is deﬁned where bubbles

larger than the critical volume will grow, while bubbles smaller than it will shrink. Following

the manner of the LSW theory, we assume that the asymptotic behavior of the distribution

function f and the kinetic equation ˙v can be scaled by the critical volume vc as

f (v, t) ∼ ty ˜f (z),

˙v(v, t) ∼ tω˜˙v(z),

(2)

(3)

where z ≡ v/vc is a scaling variable, vc is the critical volume, and y and ω are scaling

exponents, respectively. For later convenience, we deﬁne the cumulative distribution function

(CDF)

where

F (v, t) = C −1Z v

0

f (v, t)dv,

C ≡ Z ∞

0

f (v, t)dv,

since its scaling behavior is simple as

F (v, t) ∼ ˜F (z).

We assume that the power-law growth of the critical volume as

vc(t) = v0tx

(4)

(5)

(6)

(7)

with a coeﬃcient v0 and a scaling exponent x. We require that the total volume of gas is

conserved, i.e.,

d

dt Z vf dv = 0,

(8)

which leads to y = −2x. From the the equation of continuity (1), the additional relation

ω = x−1 can be obtained with straight forward calculations. Since there are three exponents

and two constraints, only one degree of freedom remains, x, which determines the dynamics

of coarsening. For example, the time evolution of the average volume of bubbles ¯v has the

following power-law behavior with the exponent x as

¯v ≡

1

n Z vf dv ∼ tx,

4

(9)

where n(t) is the total number of bubbles deﬁned as

n ≡ Z f dv.

(10)

Inserting Eqs. (2) and (3) into Eq. (1), we have the ordinary diﬀerential equation of the

scaling functions as,

x(2 ˜f + z

d ˜f
dz

) =

d

dz   ˜˙v ˜f
v0 ! .

(11)

The above equation can be solved in the following manner [11]. Equation (11) can be

rewritten as,

where

Integrating Eq. (12), we have

˜f =

d

dz (cid:16)u ˜f(cid:17) ,

u(z) ≡

˜˙v
xv0

− z.

˜f (z) =

1
|u|

expZ z

0

1
u

dz.

(12)

(13)

(14)

Equation (14) means that the distribution function f can be determined from the kinetic

equation ˙v.

The kinetic equation has diﬀerent form corresponding to the bottle-neck of the system [1,

2, 13, 16, 17]. Especially, Wagner discussed two cases, the diﬀusion-limited and the reaction-

limited, simultaneously [2]. If the system is diﬀusion-limited, then the kinetic equation has

the following form

˙v(v, t) ∝ "(cid:18) v

vc(cid:19)1/3

− 1# .

(15)

The above immediately leads to ω = 0, and therefore, x = 1, corresponding to the t1/3 law.

On the other hand, the kinetic equation int the reaction-limited system becomes

˙v(v, t) = Kv1/3"(cid:18) v

vc(cid:19)1/3

− 1# ,

(16)

with a constant coeﬃcient K. Using the scaling variable z ≡ v/vc, the kinetic equation (16)

can be rewritten to be

where

˙v(v, t) = tx/3˜˙v(z),

˜˙v(z) ≡ Kv1/3

0 z1/3(z1/3 − 1).

Equation (17) leads to ω = x/3. Considering the relation ω = x − 1, we obtain x = 3/2 and

ω = 1/2, corresponding to the t1/2 law.

It is worth mentioning about the behavior of a kinetic equation in the limit of v → 0.

While the shrink rate remains ﬁnite in the diﬀusion limited case (15), it becomes zero in the

reaction limited case (16). Therefore, if the shrink rate of a small bubble goes to zero, it is

a strong evidence that the dynamics is of the reaction limited.

III. METHODS

We have analyzed the data obtained by MD simulation with the truncated Lennard-

Jones (LJ) potential. Refer the previous study for the details of the simulation [13].

In

the following, we measure the physical quantities in the units of LJ, i.e., the Boltzmann

constant kB is set to be unity, the length is measured by the diameter of atoms, and so

forth. The system is a cube with linear size 960. The periodic boundary condition is taken

in all directions. The time step is ﬁxed to 0.005 throughout the simulations. The system

is ﬁrst thermalized to be the pure-liquid phase using Nos´e–Hoover thermostat [18]. The

time evolution of the isothermal system is perforemd by the reversible reference system

propagation algorithm (r-RESPA) [19]. We consider two initial temperatures, T = 0.8

and 1.0. After thermalization of 104 steps, the thermostat is turned oﬀ and uniform and

adiabatic expansion is performed. The linear size of the system is then changed from 960 to

984. The number of atoms, the initial densities and the densities after the expansions are

summarized in Table. I. The system becomes unstable after the expansion and many bubbles

appears. The snapshots of the system are stored every 1000 steps. After simulations, we

identify bubbles for each snapshot on the basis of the subcell-dividing method [13, 20–22].

The system is divided into subcells and the local density is computed in each subcell. A

FIG. 1: A schematic illustration of the calculation of the kinetic equation. There are two successive

snapshots. We ﬁrst identify bubbles in each snapshots and then identify which bubble in a snapshots

corresponds to which in the other one. In this example, two bubbles are found, A and B. After

some time evolution, the bubble A grows while the bubble B shrinks. We can calculate the growth

or shrinkage rates of them with the ﬁnite diﬀerence approximation.

subcell is identiﬁed to be in gas phase when its local density is lower than some threshold.

Neighboring subcells in gas phase are identiﬁed to be a bubble. Since the densities of gas

and liquid diﬀer substantially, the identiﬁcation process is robust against the value of the

threshold. We choose the linear length of subcells to be 3.075. The volume of each subcell is

29.08 which determines the resolution of bubbles’ volume. Simulations were performed with

a parallelized MD program [23, 24] on 4096 nodes of the K computer at RIKEN. We conﬁrm

that the volume fraction of gas phase to liquid phase becomes almost constant during the

coarsening, and the fraction is about 4% [13].

We calculated the growth or shrinkage rate of bubbles as follows. Consider two successive

snapshots at time t−τ and t+τ . First, we identify bubbles for each snapshot. If two bubbles

have spatial overlap across two snapshots, then two bubbles are identiﬁed to be the same

bubble (see Fig. 1). Suppose a bubble i has a volume vi at time t. In order to obtain the

growth rate of the bubble, we adopt the central diﬀerence as

˙vi(t) ∼

vi(t + τ ) − vi(t − τ )

2τ

,

(19)

with a ﬁxed time interval τ . In this simulation, we use τ = 5. A pair of the volume and

the growth rate (v(t), ˙v(t)) can be determined from a bubble in the snapshots. We calculate

all growth rate of bubbles in a snapshot at time t. The set of growth rates is nothing but

the kinetic equation. While we consider two initial temperatures, we mainly describe the

results at T = 0.8 in the following, since the results at the higher temperature is found to

be diﬃcult to analyze. We will discuss it later.

IV. RESULTS

A. Scaling Behavior of the kinetic term

The obtained kinetic equation at T = 0.8 is shown in Fig. 2 (a). The kinetic equations

are found to be almost single value functions. This fact means that bubbles feel the iden-

tical pressure at each time, and therefore, a mean-ﬁeld like treatment is justiﬁed at this

temperature. The scaling plot of the kinetic equations are shown in Fig. 2 (b). The kinetic

equation at diﬀerent time are well scaled with respect to the scaling variable z. One can

also conﬁrm that there is a critical volume z = 1, and growth rates of bubbles smaller than

the critical size are negative, and therefore, the smaller bubbles shrink and vice versa. The

solid line is the theoretical prediction in Eq. (18). There are two ﬁtting parameters, K and

v0, which are determined to be 168(4) and 16.7(3), respectively. The function form of the

kinetic equation is well described by the prediction for the reaction-limited case (16), and

clearly diﬀerent from the form in the diﬀusion-limited case (15).

B. Critical Volume

Since the function form of the kinetic equation is well described by the theoretical pre-

diction, we can estimate the critical volume at each time by ﬁtting Eq. (16) to the obtained

data. For ﬁtting, we ﬁx the value of the coeﬃcient K to be 168 which is obtained by the

scaling behavior of the kinetic equation. Therefore, the only ﬁtting parameter is the critical

volume vc(t) at each time t. The time evolution of the critical volume at T = 0.8 is shown

in Fig. 3.

In the scaling regime (t > 103) , the critical volume is well described by the

power-law behavior (7) with the exponent x = 3/2. Assuming Eq. (7), we can estimated

C. Distribution function

The kinetic equation (16) contains only two coeﬃcients, K and v0. Since we have deter-

mined the value of them, we can reconstruct the distribution function using the relation in

Eq. (14). The scaling behavior of the CDFs at T = 0.8 are shown in Fig. 4. The scaled

CDFs are well described by the reconstructed function.

D. Higher temperature

So far, we discuss the data obtained in the lower temperature T = 0.8. In the previous

work, we found that crossover of the value of the exponent from 3/2 to 1 as temperature

increases [13]. Considering the value x = 1, the system in T = 1.0 is expected to be of the

diﬀusion-limited case, and the kinetic equation should be described by the form in Eq. (15).

However, we found that the kinetic equations at higher temperature are not single-valued

function as shown in Fig. 5. This behavior of the bubbles shows that bubbles with same

volume have diﬀerent growth rates, and therefore, the mean-ﬁeld like treatment cannot be

justiﬁed.

V. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

To summarize, we have performed the molecular simulations of bubble coarsening. From

the time evolution of the bubble conﬁgurations, we have determined the kinetic equation

of bubbles.

In low temperature regime, the function form of the kinetic equation is as

predicted by the case of the reaction-limited. The bubble-size distribution functions are well

reconstructed from the obtained kinetic equation. Note that, it is trivial that a function can

be reconstructed if we use all information of its derivative. What we have done here is that

we ﬁrst determine the value of two constants, K and v0, and we reproduce the distribution

function for any bubbles’ volume v and time t assuming the form of the kinetic term in

Eq. (16). These analyses show that the classical LSW theory successfully describes bubble

coarsening without additional corrections when the temperature of the system is suﬃciently

low. The comparison between the distribution functions and the form predicted by the

LSW theory is given in Fig. 4 (b). Many past studies reported that while the distribution

functions in late stage have the self-similarity, the forms of them are generally broader than

the LSW predictions [5]. While the scaling behaviors of distribution functions and kinetic

equations are well conﬁrmed, the accuracy of the calculation is insuﬃcient to discuss the

shape of the form, especially to determine whether the obtained form is broader than the

predictions or not. This should be one of the further issues. The growth or shrinkage rate

at higher temperature T = 1.0 is found to be a multivalued function, i.e., a growth rate of a

11

bubble cannot be determined by its volume. This suggests that the pressure of the system is

inhomogeneous, and therefore, the mean-ﬁeld treatments is expected to fail. Nevertheless the

distribution function shows the self-similarity and the value of the exponent is as predicted

by the LSW theory for the diﬀusion-limited case. This is also one of the problems which

should be resolved in the future.
