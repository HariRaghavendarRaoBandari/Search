We use a description based on diﬀerential forms to systematically explore the space of scalar-tensor
theories of gravity. Within this formalism, we propose a basis for the scalar sector at the lowest order
in derivatives of the ﬁeld and in any number of dimensions. This minimal basis is used to construct
a ﬁnite and closed set of Lagrangians describing general scalar-tensor theories invariant under Local
Lorentz Transformations in a pseudo-Riemannian manifold, which contains ten physically distinct
elements in four spacetime dimensions. Subsequently, we compute their corresponding equations
of motion and ﬁnd which combinations are at most second order in derivatives in four as well
as arbitrary number of dimensions. By studying the possible exact forms (total derivatives) and
algebraic relations between the basis components, we discover that there are only four Lagrangian
combinations producing second order equations, which can be associated with Horndeski’s theory. In
this process, we identify a new second order Lagrangian, named kinetic Gauss-Bonnet, that was not
previously considered in the literature. However, we show that its dynamics is already contained
in Horndeski’s theory. Finally, we provide a full classiﬁcation of the relations between diﬀerent
second order theories. This allows us to clarify, for instance, the connection between diﬀerent
covariantizations of Galileons theory. In conclusion, our formulation aﬀords great computational
simplicity with a systematic structure, facilitating advances towards unveiling the most general
scalar-tensor theories.

INTRODUCTION

Gravity is central to many of the unsolved problems in physics, from the origin of the Universe and its fate, to
the uniﬁcation of the fundamental interactions. Despite its fantastic successes, Einstein’s theory might not be the
ﬁnal answer and it is necessary to explore diﬀerent paradigms to shed light on these deep questions. In this sense,
alternative theories of gravity can be viewed as eﬀective descriptions of the underlying theory of quantum gravity or
tools to solve other theoretical issues, such as the cosmological constant problem.

Recent advances in cosmology also motivate the proposal and investigations of alternatives to Einstein’s theory.
The discovery of the current era of accelerated expansion [1, 2] requires a radical change in our description of gravity:
either by the inclusion of new gravitational degrees of freedom or by the introduction of a tiny cosmological constant
that challenges our interpretation of gravity as an eﬀective ﬁeld theory [3]. Moreover, mounting evidence indicates
that the early universe underwent another phase of accelerated expansion, cosmic inﬂation, that shaped the large scale
features of the universe and seeded perturbations that evolved into galaxies and other large scale structures [4, 5].
Cosmic inﬂation could not be caused by a cosmological constant and requires additional degrees of freedom able to
strongly aﬀect the gravitational dynamics.

Finally, alternative paradigms are necessary to put our notions of gravity to the test in disparate regimes and honor
the eﬀort of experimental collaborations. Earth experiments and Solar System measurements provide very precise
data through a variety of post-newtonian eﬀects [6]. Cosmological observations of the expansion of the universe and
the evolution of large scale structure provide complementary information on the largest scales available to observation

[7–9]. Finally, astrophysical systems [10] such as binary pulsars [11] and our central black hole [12] can be used to
explore gravity in the strong ﬁeld regime in which general-relativistic eﬀects are dominant. The recent discovery of
gravitational waves from a black hole merger at cosmological distance [13] provides a double edge tool for this eﬀort,
allowing us to extract information both from the strong ﬁeld regime and from the cosmological expansion.

The theoretical questions and the experimental enterprise have motivated the construction of novel, alternative
theories of gravity. Among them, scalar-tensor (ST) theories provide the minimal extension of Einstein’s theory, with
one single additional degree of freedom. Such degree of freedom, the scalar ﬁeld, has historically been used in eﬀective
ﬁeld theories to describe phenomena whose energy scale is not accessible, e.g.
in the Landau-Ginzburg theory of
superconductivity [14] before Bardeen-Cooper-Schriﬀer electron-hole pairs and condensate [15], or the description of
pions [16] before the discovery of quarks [17]. There could be fundamental scalars like the Higgs, recently discovered
at the LHC [18, 19], but most of these ﬁelds are eﬀective descriptions of a more complicated underlying dynamics, like
the scalaron in the case of Starobinsky inﬂation [20, 21]. In any case, the inclusion of a scalar partner of the graviton
in scalar-tensor theories seems the most economical extension of Einstein gravity.

In addition, the simplicity of the scalar ﬁeld under Lorentz transformations enables one to couple it to the metric
in many diﬀerent ways, allowing the introduction of a rich pattern of possible interactions with the tensor degrees
of freedom. Moreover, it is easy to propose ST models with interesting cosmologies, as shown by the plethora of
inﬂationary models considered in the literature [4, 5]. In contrast, other theories with more degrees of freedom are
far more restricted. Such is the case of theories with massive gravitons, which were only recently developed [22, 23]
(see [24, 25] for reviews) and lead to either instabilities [26] or lack of distinctive signatures [27] in their application
to cosmology. For this reasons, ST theories have become the standard for tests of gravity as well as models for cosmic
acceleration.

In the pursuit of generality, systematic approaches are essential to characterize alternative paradigms and ensure
that every possibility is addressed.
In this sense, Ostrogradski’s theorem allows us to distinguish theories with
additional and ghost degrees of freedom caused by higher derivatives in the action [28] (for a modern presentation
see [29]). Furthermore, this result also allows us to classify ST theories depending on the mechanism by which they
avoid Ostrogradski’s result. The ﬁrst generation of theories contains no derivatives of the scalar and are given by
generalizations of Jordan-Brans-Dicke theories [30]. Theories in the second generation are described by second order
equations of motion and are characterized by Horndeski’s theory [31]. Finally, a third generation of theories with
higher-derivative dynamical equations but no additional degrees of freedom has been recently identiﬁed [32, 33]. This
new family of ST theories is now an active area of research aimed at ﬁnding the most general framework for ghost-free
ST gravity.

A general and systematized classiﬁcation of gravitational theories is a very challenging task and several attempts
have relied on simplifying assumptions in order to construct the most possible general interactions. This has been
particularly fruitful in the context of cosmology, where the high degree of symmetry of the background solution
facilitates the characterization of possible gravitational interactions order-by-order in the perturbations. This eﬀort
led to the eﬀective ﬁeld theory of inﬂation [34], which was latter generalized to its dark energy analog to explore
late-time cosmic acceleration [35, 36] (and reﬁnements within speciﬁc frameworks [37, 38]). One of our objectives is
to provide the tools to systematically explore this landscape of theories and understand their features without relying
on such simplifying assumptions.

At the same time, systematic approaches have also appeared for gravitational theories with only tensorial degrees
of freedom.
In this ﬁeld, the basic work was made by Lovelock [39], who found the most general second order
Euler-Lagrange equations for a single massless spin-2 particle in arbitrary dimensions. Then, he found the associated
Lagrangian, which is the natural generalization of Einstein’s theory.
In this sense, Horndeski’s theory is just the
scalar-tensor extension of Lovelock’s theory in four dimensions. To apply these theories to the real world, one must
remember that in order to couple fermions to gravity, the gravitational theory must be reformulated in the tangent
space [40], which can be easily done using diﬀerential forms language [41]. From this point of view, systematic studies
have been performed too, for instance in Ref.
[42]. Despite of the actual need of coupling fermions to gravity, the
diﬀerential form version of Lovelock’s theory has been very useful to simplify the computations and understand the
inner structure of the theory. Diﬀerential forms have also been used in theories involving massive gravitons [43], but
such an analysis had not been performed yet in the case of scalar-tensor theories.

In this paper, we are going to investigate the space of ST theories using the language of diﬀerential forms. The
advantage will be that we are going to ﬁnd a ﬁnite and closed basis of Lagrangians. Moreover, the antisymmetric
structures used to derive, for instance, Horndeski’s theory [31] or Generalised Galileons (G2) [44], which could seem ad-
hoc at ﬁrst sight, naturally arise from the requirement that the building blocks of the Lagrangian are diﬀerential forms.
Remarkably, this approach also clearly disentangles the internal relations between diﬀerent ST theories, presenting in
a systematic way all the equivalences through total derivatives or algebraic identities.

In Sec. II we present the set of diﬀerential forms that will act as building blocks for our basis of ST theories. Since
this section is going to be discussed using the mathematics of diﬀerential forms, we have included a summary of the

key concepts in Appendix A. In Sec. III we analyze which Lagrangians of our basis (or combinations thereof) give rise
to second order equations of motion, thus becoming automatically free of Ostrogradski’s instabilities. We will ﬁrst
consider the scalar equations of motion, Sec. III A, and then the tensorial ones, Sec. III B. Subsequently, we will study
the relations between diﬀerent second order theories in Sec. IV. This will allow us to identify which second order
Lagrangians are independent. Finally, in Sec. V, we will conclude by summarizing the main results and discussing
the advantages and potential of our approach.

II. A GENERAL BASIS FOR SCALAR-TENSOR THEORIES

Scalar-tensor theories are generally described by an action functional S, which corresponds to the integral of the
Lagrangian L over the curved space-time.
In this paper, we are going to exploit the fact that, mathematically,
integration is an operation deﬁned in terms of the space of diﬀerential forms Ωq(M), where q is the order of the
q-form and the dimension of the base manifold M. Since the action is deﬁned as an integral over a D-dimensional
curved space-time manifold, the Lagrangian must be a D-form, i.e.

(cid:90)

S =

M L.

(1)

Crucially, a D-form is characterized for being proportional to the volume element η = √−gdx1 ∧ ··· ∧ dxD, leading
to a direct connection with the usual component notation. Furthermore, due to the fact that Ωq(M) is constructed
as the space of totally antisymmetric (0, q)-tensors, if we construct our D-form Lagrangians with exterior products of
diﬀerential forms, the set of possibilities will be ﬁnite.

In order to determine a general basis for scalar-tensor Lagrangians, we must ﬁrst identify the appropriate building
blocks written in diﬀerential form language. From the tensorial side, we have the usual geometrical quantities charac-
terizing a manifold. In particular, we will work with diﬀerentiable manifolds with an associated metric g and 1-form
connection ωa
b. Also, we will ﬁx the metric to have a Lorentzian signature. Moreover, we will focus on manifolds
with a vanishing torsion T a = 0 and a metric-compatible connection ωab = −ωba, i.e. pseudo-Riemannian manifolds.
In such a case, the connection is uniquely determined by the non-coordinate basis elements θa, which can be related
to the curved space-time metric via the ﬂat Minkowski metric ηab, i.e. g = ηabθa ⊗ θb.
Introducing an exterior
covariant derivative D constructed from ωa
b, the geometry of the manifold is encoded in the 2-form curvature, deﬁned
as Ra
b. This will be our building block charactering the tensorial part of the action. In components, it reads

b = Dωa

Ra

b =

Ra

bcdθc ∧ θd,

(2)

where Ra
bcd is the corresponding Riemann tensor. One should notice that, throughout the text, we will use latin
indices to denote non-coordinate components and greek indices for coordinate ones. Both basis are linked with the
vielbein ea
µdxµ. Moreover, the 1-form connection ω and the Levi-Civita connection Γ are related by
the vielbein postulate ∇µea
b = 0. In case
the reader is not familiar with this notation, we have included in App. A a short review on diﬀerential geometry in
diﬀerential forms language.

ν = 0. In this language, Bianchi’s second identity simply implies that DRa

µ by θa = ea

Subsequently, we must encounter possible q-forms describing the scalar ﬁeld and its derivatives. The scalar ﬁeld
φ itself deﬁnes a 0-form. Its partial derivative is also a well-deﬁned 1-form, corresponding to the exterior derivative
of the scalar ﬁeld dφ = ∇µφdxµ. However, it is not trivial to introduce the second covariant derivative of the scalar
ﬁeld ∇µ∇νφ because it is a symmetric (0, 2)-tensor. Consequently, we must ﬁnd an appropriate antisymmetric tensor
which encodes the information from the second derivatives. Since the tensor is symmetric, we cannot apply directly
an antisymmetric operator, i.e. ∇[µ∇ν]φ = 0. If we apply an antisymmetric operator to only one of the indices, in
order to ﬁnally obtain a q-form, we will end up with a D-form, which is a trivial case since it is already proportional
to the volume element. Additionally, using Poincare lemma, the exterior derivative of the gradient ﬁeld vanishes, i.e.
ddφ = 0. Moreover, by deﬁnition, the wedge product of dφ with itself is also zero, i.e. dφ ∧ dφ = 0. This means
that using this 1-form we could never construct the kinetic term, because it contains two ﬁrst derivatives. Clearly,
we need more adequate deﬁnitions of the q-forms representing the ﬁrst and second derivatives of the scalar ﬁeld. In
the following, we propose a minimal setup, in which derivatives of the ﬁeld appear in the lowest possible order while
fulﬁlling our requirements. This leads to two derivatives of the scalar in each element of the basis. In App. B 1, we
introduce a non-linear generalization of the scalar-tensor theories we are going to present next.

Let us deﬁne two vector-valued 1-forms that encode the ﬁrst and second covariant derivatives of φ

Ψa ≡ ∇aφ∇bφ θb,
Φa ≡ ∇a∇bφ θb.

(3)

(4)

Then, we will construct the most general scalar-tensor theory obeying:

• It is described by an action principle in which the Lagrangian is a D-form invariant under Local Lorentz

Transformations (LLT) deﬁned in a pseudo-Riemannian manifold.
• The Lagrangian is built up out of exterior products of the vielbein θa, the 2-form curvature Rab, ﬁrst derivatives
of the scalar ﬁeld Ψa and second derivatives of the scalar ﬁeld Φa.

4

As a consequence, in order to have a Lagrangian invariant under LLT, there cannot be free indices. Thus, they must
be contracted with the tangent space metric ηab and the totally antisymmetric symbol a1···aD , which are invariant
objects1. Moreover, the fact that we restrict to pseudo-Riemannian manifolds, i.e. manifolds with a metric-compatible
connection and a vanishing torsion, implies that all the tensorial dynamics is contained in the 2-form curvature (2).
With these two conditions, we can deﬁne a basis of Lagrangian given by

L(lmn) =

where (cid:86) is an abbreviation for a set of consecutive wedge products and l, m, n ∈ N. In this notation, if any of the

subindices of the Lagrangian are zero, the corresponding terms in the r.h.s do not appear. Here, θ(cid:63)

(6)

One should notice that the previous result dφ ∧ dφ = 0 appears in this notation making L(lmn) vanish for n > 1.
Additionally, it must hold that 2l + m + n ≤ D due to the antisymmetry by the Hodge dual basis. This will be very
important because it means that for a given dimension D our basis of Lagrangians will be ﬁnite. Interestingly, if we
do not include the scalar ﬁeld, setting m = n = 0, these Lagrangians correspond to Lovelock’s theory [39] written in
diﬀerential forms (see [45] for a modern summary using our notation). Therefore, this basis of Lagrangians could be
seen as its scalar-tensor extension. Finally, it is important to remark that there are three additional Lagrangians that
fulﬁl our premises but are not included in our basis (5). They correspond to Lagrangians in which the indices of the
building blocks are contracted among them, e.g. Rab ∧ Φa ∧ Ψb. However, they do not lead to second order equations
of motion. Thus, we discard them from the beginning. For completeness, we present them in App. B 2.
In the scalar-tensor theories represented by the basis (5), the action will be the sum over all possible Lagrangians

with diﬀerent l, m and n integrated over the space-time manifold, i.e.

where p ≡ 2l + m + n and n ≤ 1. In this context, the coeﬃcients αlmn represents 0-forms, which, in general2, can be
functions of the scalar ﬁeld and its derivatives αlmn = αlmn(φ, X, [Φ],··· ), where we are using the notation, detailed

exempliﬁed in App. A 3, for which a square bracket represents the contraction of two free indices, e.g.
and an angle bracket the contraction with partial derivatives of the scalar ﬁeld, e.g. (cid:104)tµν(cid:105) ≡ φ,µtµνφ,ν. Also, partial
derivatives are shorten by a comma, ∂µφ = φ,µ, and covariant derivatives by a semicolon, ∇µ∇νφ = φ;µν. Lastly, we
write the contractions of second derivatives as Φn
In 4D, we have 15 possible Lagrangians in our basis. In order to translate them into the usual component notation,
we only need to apply the deﬁnition of the wedge product and the Hodge dual basis. For completeness, we present in
App. A 3 the explicit component expression for a general L(lmn). Here, we show for the ﬁrst cases how this general
recipe works. Recalling that η = θ1 ∧ ··· ∧ θD is the volume element, we ﬁnd the following Lagrangians:

1 We will choose the convention ηab = diag(−1, 1, 1, 1) for the metric signatures and 0123 = +1 for the antisymmetrizations.
2 Here, it will be important that the coeﬃcient is a 0-form and that we are constructing the geometrical quantities out of the 2-form
curvature Rab. Consequently, we will not consider any dependence in curvature scalars in αlmn, e.g. R2 or RabRab. In this sense,
we will not be covering theories such as f (R) [46] or more generally f (Lovelock) [47], which are automatically free of Ostrogradski’s
instabilities. Nevertheless, such theories can be described as scalar-tensor theories in most cases [47].

where R is the Ricci scalar, Rab is the Ricci tensor and Gab is the Einstein tensor, given by Gab = Rab − 1
2 gabR.
As a consequence of the above expressions, we can easily relate our results with the current literature. For instance,
the modern version of Horndeski’s Theory [31] is a linear combination of (8), (9), (11-12) and (14-15), and the class
of viable theories Beyond Horndeski known as Generalized Generalized Galileons (G3) [33] are simply (17) and (22).
In addition, terms such as (16) and (21) appear when doing a Kaluza-Klein compactiﬁcation of higher dimensional
Lovelock’s densities [48]. Furthermore, when we are in ﬂat space, Galileon theory [49] is built up with (9), (10),
(13), (17) and (22).
In this work, we will show that there is a well-established interconnection between all these
Lagrangians. In fact, not all of them are independent, as we will see in Sec. IV, and only certain linear combination
give rise to second order equations of motion, cf. Sec. III.

Before computing the Euler-Lagrange equations, we should consider an extension of our basis (5), which naturally
appears when one applies an exterior derivative to the previous expressions. Acting D on the scalar one-forms Ψa
and Φa, given in (3) and (4), we ﬁnd3:

DΨa =D(∇aφ) ∧ Dφ + ∇aφ ∧ D(Dφ) = Φa ∧ Dφ,

Also, we have assumed a vanishing torsion, which in terms of D reads T a = Dθa = 0, implying that Dθ(cid:63)

Lastly, we have used that Φa = D(∇aφ). Thus, a covariant exterior derivative applied on Φa introduces a contraction
of the 2-form curvature with the ﬁrst derivative of the scalar ﬁeld. Moreover, if we apply this derivative to a general
coeﬃcient αlmn = αlmn(φ, X, [Φ],··· ), we obtain

derivatives, contractions of the building blocks with gradient ﬁelds appear. For that reason, we enlarge the two
deﬁning conditions of the basis of Lagrangians L(lmn) presented above to allow contractions with the gradient ﬁeld
∇aφ. In the following, we summarize all the relevant new terms of the extended basis in

and L(lm¯1) = −2XL(lm1). As before, this general Lagrangian written in diﬀerential forms can be translated into
components. We include the component expression of the 10 possible contracted Lagrangians in 4D in App. C 1.

III. EQUATIONS OF MOTION

In order to obtain the equations of motion (e.o.m.), we must vary the action (7). When we vary with respect to
the frame θa, we end up with the vielbein e.o.m (equivalent to Palatini variation). In this respect, we will restrict our
computations to the second order formalism, i.e. we will consider the connection 1-form as a unique function of the
vielbein, ω = ω(θ) (equivalent to metric variation). However, as it will become clear later, our approach can be easily
extrapolated to a ﬁrst order formalism, where ωab and θa are independent variables. When we vary with respect to
the scalar ﬁeld φ, we obtain the scalar e.o.m. We will include a 0-form coeﬃcient in front of every Lagrangian, namely
αlmn. The functional dependence of these coeﬃcients αlmn = αlmn(φ, X, [Φ],··· ) will be relevant to derive the e.o.m.
In fact, it will be a crucial ingredient for analyzing the derivative order of the e.o.m. Our goal will be to compute
the e.o.m. associated to each possible L(lmn). Then, we will look for combinations of those Lagrangians giving rise to
second order e.o.m., thus automatically evading Ostrogradski instabilities [28]. Since there is a well deﬁned hierarchy
in terms of the number of ﬁelds, or the number p, deﬁned as p ≡ 2l + m + n, we will follow that order to obtain the
e.o.m., from lower to higher p.
Before computing the e.o.m., we will have to work out some expressions. Since we want to work in a manifestly
covariant way, we will use the exterior covariant derivative D.
In this notation, Cartan’s structure equations are
simply T a = Dθa and Ra
b = Dωa
b = 0. For the
scalar 1-forms Ψa and Φa, we have already seen that acting with D yields (23) and (24). Also, we will make use of
the generalized Stoke’s theorem [50]

b. Accordingly, Bianchi identities read DT a = Ra

Assuming that the boundary contribution vanishes, this could be used, for instance, to move the derivative from
one q-form to another in a wedge product, recalling that the exterior derivative follows a graded Leibniz rule, i.e.
d(αq ∧ βr) = (dαq) ∧ βr + (−1)qαq ∧ (dβr), where αq is a q-form. In addition, we will use the following identities

ν = 0, the derivatives act trivially on the Hodge dual basis, i.e. Dθ(cid:63)

where iV ω represents the interior product4 of a q-form ω with respect to a vector ﬁeld V . The ﬁrst identity, (29), is
just the diﬀerential form version of the commutator of two covariant derivatives. The second one, (30), is the analog
of Bianchi’s second identity. Furthermore, thanks to the vanishing of the torsion, T a = Dθa = 0, and the vielbein
postulate, ∇µea
Finally, one should notice that the possible higher derivative terms, meaning higher than two derivatives in φ or
θa, will be ∇zΦa and ∇zRab. However, whenever all of the indices are contracted with the Hodge dual basis, the
previous terms are not dangerous due to the antisymmetry of its indices. In the ﬁrst case, a commutator of covariant
derivatives naturally appears. In the second case, the whole expression vanishes due to Bianchi second identity. To
make this point more visual, we will use the ﬁrst letters of the latin alphabet, a, b, c,··· , to indicate indices of the
Hodge dual basis. Conversely, we will use the last letters of the latin alphabet, z, y, x,··· , to denote indices not
contracted with the Hodge dual. Indeed, one could notice that we have implicitly introduced this index notation in
previous expressions. Furthermore, to make the computations as clear as possible, we will underline the dangerous
higher derivative terms. When the line is dashed, e.g. ∇zΦa , it will indicate that this particular higher derivative
term is compensated with another term in the same expression. This cancellation of higher derivatives will be caused
by the commutation of covariant derivatives, (29), or by applying Bianchi identity, (30). On the contrary, when
the higher derivative term is not cancelled within that expression, we will underline the term with a solid line, e.g.
∇zRab. The philosophy will be to investigate if the remaining solid underlined terms of diﬀerent Lagrangians can be
eliminated by choosing appropriate coeﬃcients among them. If the ﬁnal Lagrangian can be directly related with the
standard formulation of Horndeski’s theory, we will dub it LH

A. Scalar Equations of Motion

We begin the computation with the scalar e.o.m. As it was stated before, we will classify the diﬀerent Lagrangians
by the order of the q-form constructed with the curvature 2-form and the ﬁrst and second derivative one-forms, i.e.
by an increasing number p. At each level, we will consider separately the Lagrangians with n = 0 and n = 1, because
they have a diﬀerent structure. One should notice that the only building blocks of our basis depending on φ are Ψa
and Φa. Their variations with respect to the scalar ﬁeld follow

δΨa = ∇aδφDφ + ∇aφDδφ,
δΦa = D∇aδφ,

(31)
(32)

where we have used that the variation commutes with the covariant derivatives. Additionally, we will have to consider
the variation of the coeﬃcient in front of each Lagrangian L(lmn). In the following, we will focus ﬁrst in the case of
4D, where we will denote the coeﬃcients by Gi, Fi, Ei and Hi for shortness. Since the structure of the computation
will be very similar, we will only include the details of the calculations for the ﬁrst cases. For the rest, we will include
the full result only in App. C 2. Afterwards, we will generalize the result to D-dimensions, where we will use the
general notation for the coeﬃcients αlmn because it will be important to analyse terms with diﬀerent (lmn). As we
have mentioned above, the coeﬃcients can, in principle, depend on higher derivative scalars, e.g.
[Φ]. However, we
will argue in the next computation that they must depend only in φ and X in order to have second-order equations.

(i) p = 0

For this ﬁrst case, we only need to consider G2L(000) = G2 ∧ θ(cid:63). The scalar e.o.m are simply given by the
variation of the coeﬃcient G2 = G2(φ, X, [Φ],··· ), i.e.

δ(G2L(000)) =δG2 ∧ θ(cid:63)

(33)

(cid:19)

Therefore, in order to obtain 2nd order e.o.m, we only need to impose G2 = G2(φ, X). Importantly, this will
also happen for the rest of the cases. The point is that if the coeﬃcient depends on second derivatives or
higher, there will always be a higher derivative term in the e.o.m. proportional to the original Lagrangian, e.g.
∇z∇z(Gi,[Φ])L(lmn). Thus, it cannot be cancelled with another term in the e.o.m. since any other variation

changes the original Lagrangian5. Moreover, it cannot be eliminated with similar terms from other Lagrangians
since they will be proportional to diﬀerent L(lmn). Consequently, we will have to impose Gi = Gi(φ, X) in the
following calculations. In this particular case, L(000) = η, choosing G2 = G2(φ, X) also eliminates the possible
degeneracy of having G2 equal to the component form of any other L(lmn), see (9-22). Nevertheless, there is a
remaining degeneracy between G2(φ, X)∧L(000) and L(001) = −2Xη that we will deal in Sec. IV B. In conclusion,
for p = 0, we have found that the e.o.m. of the following Lagrangian are at most 2nd order

Since this Lagrangian can be directly linked with Horndeski’s theory, we have used the superscript H.

At this level, we have two possible Lagrangians, L(010) and L(001). As mentioned above, we are going to consider
separately the ones with n = 0 and n = 1. We begin with G3L(010) = G3 ∧ Φa ∧ θ(cid:63)

Now, using the commutation of covariant derivatives, (29), we can eliminate the higher derivatives of the terms

we must impose that G3 = G3(φ, X) to avoid higher than two Euler-Lagrange equations. Consequently, any

In the following computations, we will write directly the expanded expression after
applying Stoke’s theorem.
In conclusion, imposing G3 = G3(φ, X) ensures that the e.o.m.

Gi reproduces the component expression of any of the Lagrangians L(lmn) considered in the next computations. Obviously, this would
imply a repetition of the same results. Thus, in the following, we are going to set Gi = Gi(φ, X) to eliminate this degeneracy.

Secondly, we compute

δ(F4L(020)) =δF4 ∧ Φa ∧ Φb ∧ θ(cid:63)

Subsequently, we can analyze the higher derivative terms, recalling that when all the indices are antisymmetrized
there is no such a problematic term. As in the previous case, using the commutation of covariant derivatives,
(29), we can rewrite the dashed underlined terms of (41) as a curvature 2-form. Moreover, we can rearrange the
solid underlined term of (40), recalling Bianchi identity, (30), in order to compensate the corresponding one of
(41). Doing so, we learn that these higher derivative terms only cancel each other if F4 = G4,X . Additionally,
2nd order e.o.m. are only achieved if G4 = G4(φ, X). Altogether, we have obtained that

is a second-order Lagrangian. Clearly, writing it in components, we recover the well-known L4 of Horndeski’s
theory. For the rest of the cases, the process of ﬁnding a Lagrangian with second order e.o.m. will be analogous to
the one just described: using the commutation of covariant derivatives, (29) one eliminates the higher derivatives
of the dashed underlined terms, and, using Bianchi identity, (30), and setting the appropriate coeﬃcient, one
cancels the unwanted parts underlined with solid lines.
When n = 1, we encounter E3L(011) = E3 ∧ Φa ∧ Ψb ∧ θ(cid:63)

When n = 0, there are three possible terms: L(200), L(120) and L(040). Nevertheless, the computation is equivalent
to the previous cases in which we had two higher derivatives terms arising from each of the Lagrangians that
cancel each other choosing the right coeﬃcient. In this case, L(120) will have two higher derivative terms that
will be eliminated with two other coming from L(200) and L(040) (see details in App. C 2). At the end, we ﬁnd

In the following we will refer to the above theory as kinetic Gauss-

Bonnet. To the best of our knowledge, this general Lagrangian was not considered previously in the literature.
Nevertheless, the particular case when E6 = E6(φ) describes a Gauss-Bonnet (GB) gravity coupled with a scalar
function, which is a model extensively studied in the literature, see e.g. [51]. In fact, in Ref. [52], it was claimed
that f (φ)GB is already contained in Horndeski’s theory. In the next section, we will investigate if this result
holds for the more general Lagrangian presented in (48).

In order to conclude the analysis of the scalar e.o.m., we are going to study a general L(lmn) in D-dimensions.
This calculation will help us understand how the higher than second order terms in the e.o.m. can be cancelled in
D-dimensions and what is the origin of the concrete numerical factors obtained. In particular, we are looking for
relations between diﬀerent coeﬃcients in front of each L(lmn) that build up automatically ghost-free combinations of
Lagrangians, as we have done before. In this computation, since we are considering a general case, we will use the
general notation for the coeﬃcient αlmn. As we have discussed for the e.o.m. in 4D, a dependence of αlmn in second
derivatives or higher induces higher than two derivatives terms in the e.o.m. that cannot be cancelled since they are
proportional to the original Lagrangian, e.g. ∇z∇z(αlmn,[Φ])L(lmn). For that reason, we impose from the beginning
that αlmn = αlmn(φ, X). Also, we will be mostly interested in the remaining higher derivative terms. Therefore, we
will try to keep the rest as simple as possible. Making a variation with respect to the scalar ﬁeld, we obtain

δ(αlmnL(lmn)) =δαlmn ∧ L(lmn) + αlmn ∧ δL(lmn)

where we have already used Bianchi identity (30) to rewrite the third one. Clearly, the ﬁrst two terms safely add
up to give a Riemann tensor, since they form a commutator of covariant derivatives, cf. (29). However, the last two
terms must be canceled with extra Lagrangians with diﬀerent (lmn). These new terms added will contribute also
with other higher derivative terms. We can repeat this process iteratively until we reach a Lagrangian that does not
contribute with extra higher order terms. Thus, the resulting combination that avoids higher order derivatives is

With these general expression, we can easily derive, for instance, Horndeski Lagrangians, i.e. (34), (37), (42) and
(45). Although in D-dimensions there are (D + 1)(D + 2)/2 possible Lagrangians L(lmn), the above result indicates
that there are only 2D + 1 independents linear combinations giving second order e.o.m.

B. Vielbein Equations of Motion

Subsequently, we proceed to compute the corresponding equations of motion for the frame ﬁeld θa. In doing so, we
will apply a second order approach, which means that we deﬁne the 1-form connection as a function of the vielbein
only, i.e. ω = ω(θ). This is equivalent to the metric formalism, in which it is assumed that the only dynamical degrees
of freedom are contained in the metric, i.e. Γ(g). Alternatively, one could have chosen a ﬁrst order approach (or
Palatini formalism), in which the connection 1-form and the vielbein are independent variables. As it will become
clear in the computation, our method can be easily extrapolated to that situation. Having developed the general
framework to taking variations with respect to diﬀerential forms, we will directly study the general D-dimensional
case.

A ﬁrst point to consider is how to relate the 1-form connection and the vielbein. We can do this by ﬁxing a metric-
compatible and torsionless connection, i.e. ωab = −ωba and T a = Dθa = 0 respectively. If we have two diﬀerent
connections ωab and ˜ωab, arising from θa and ˜θa, we ﬁnd that they are related by

˜ωab = ωab +

1
2

i˜eb (D ˜θa) − i˜ea (D ˜θb) + i˜ea (i˜eb (D ˜θc)) ˜θc

,

(57)

which is nothing but the diﬀerential form version of the usual torsionless spin connection in supergravity [53]. Alter-
natively, it is the non-coordinate analog of the relation between two diﬀerent Levi-Civita Connections [54]. To clarify
this formal deﬁnition, we include a more detailed discussion in App. A. Therefore, if we deﬁne a perturbed connection
δωab, to linear order in the perturbations of δθa, it will be

(cid:0)ieb (Dδθa) − iea

(cid:0)

Dδθb(cid:1) + iea (ieb (Dδθc)) θc(cid:1) = ∇bδθa − ∇aδθb.

δωab =

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

Thus, we have a relation that links δω with δθ.

As a consequence, the vielbein e.o.m. are going to be given by

where in the second line we have used the variation of the 1-form connection given in (58) and integrated by parts,
neglecting the surface terms. Nevertheless, if we want to analyze the higher derivatives only, we do not need to
calculate all the terms. First, we should notice that θa appears linearly (with an exterior product) in Φa, Ψa and
θ(cid:63)
a1···ak . Consequently, since our Lagrangian does not contain higher than second derivatives by construction, the
variation with respect to θa is not going to introduce them in the dynamical equations. Next, we should notice that
the 1-form connection appears linearly in the second derivative of the scalar ﬁeld, i.e. Φa = d∇aφ + ωab∇bφ, and
through a covariant exterior derivative in the 2-form curvature, i.e. Rab = Dωab. For these reasons, the variation
with respect to the connection, δω, takes the form

δω(αlmnL(lmn)) = lδω(Rab) ∧ αlmn[L((l−1)mn)]ab + mδω(Φa) ∧ αlmn[L(l(m−1)n)]a

= δωab ∧ (l(αlmn,φDΦ ∧ [L((l−1)mn)]ab − αlmn,X∇zφΦz ∧ [L((l−1)mn)]ab

+ mαlmn∇bφ ∧ [L(l(m−1)n)]a),

(60)

where we are taking αlmn = αlmn(φ, X) for the same arguments discussed previously (see Sec. III A). Then, to obtain
the contribution to the e.o.m., we only need to apply the covariant derivative. The ﬁrst term will be

where we have used the fact that a covariant derivative contracted with θ(cid:63)

a1···ak , in this case shown by the indices
a1···ak too is not generating higher derivatives because the indices

+ mlαlmn∇zφ∇zRbc ∧ [L((l−1)(m−1)n)]abc
+ m(m − 1)αlmn∇zφ∇zΦb ∧ [L(l(m−2)n)]ab

On the other hand, (62) has the following higher derivative terms

− lαlmn,X∇zφ∇bΦz ∧ [L((l−1)mn)]ab
+ lmαlmn∇zφ∇bRcz ∧ [L((l−1)(m−1)n)]abc

where we have exchanged a and b in order to get more similar expressions to the above ones and introduced the
relative sign between (61) and (62) appearing in (59). Using the usual commutation of indices it is straightforward
to see that the sum of (64), (65), and (68) is zero. Thus, we are led with only two higher derivatives terms

− 2lαlmn,X∇zφ∇bΦz ∧ [L((l−1)mn)]ab
+ m(m − 1)αlmn∇zφ∇zΦb ∧ [L(l(m−2)n)]ab

(69)

(70)

where the ﬁrst one correspond to the sum of (63) and (67), and the second one is (66).

As a consequence, in order to eliminate the higher derivative terms of the e.o.m. we have to add counter terms
iteratively, equivalently to the previous case of scalar e.o.m. In fact, we ﬁnd that the result is the same, i.e. the
Lagrangian given by (54).
It is interesting that in the scalar case the higher terms come from the derivatives of
the curvature while in the vielbein case they appear from third derivatives of the ﬁeld. This result has important
consequences because it means that Lagrangian (54) is a scalar-tensor theory in D-dimensions whose Euler-Lagrange
equation is second order in derivatives.

IV. COMPLETENESS OF THE FORMULATION

After computing the e.o.m., we must investigate what is the role of those Lagrangians LN H

that cannot be directly
linked with Horndeski’s theory. To accomplish this task, we must ﬁrst study if there are redundancies in our basis of
Lagrangians, meaning that diﬀerent L(lmn) give the same e.o.m. This could happen if two Lagrangians are related by
an exact form, the diﬀerential form analog of a total derivative, or by an algebraic identity. Consequently, we will study
ﬁrst the space of exact forms deﬁned by L(lmn). Then, we will analyze algebraic identities due to the antisymmetry of
the Hodge dual basis. In both cases, we will start the analysis in D-dimensions and then particularize for 4D. Finally,
we will apply all these identities, which will act as constraints linking diﬀerent Lagrangians, to conclude what is the
most general basis and what are their corresponding combinations with second order e.o.m.

i

A. Exact Forms

We begin the analysis of the completeness of the formulation by computing the possible exact forms. An exact
form is a q-form deﬁned as an exterior derivative of a (q − 1)-form, i.e. ωq = dωq−1. It is important to consider them
because by applying Stoke’s theorem (28), assuming no contribution at the boundary, they do not contribute to the
e.o.m. We can build the space of exact D-forms in an analogous way to L(lmn) in (5). However, since the exterior
derivative is a mapping from q-forms to (q + 1)-forms, we should start with an L(lmn) satisfying p ≤ D − 1. Moreover,
we should be aware that the ﬁnal outcome must be part of the basis of Lagrangians in order to have a closed set. For
that reason, we cannot directly consider the reduction of L(lmn) with an interior product, which is a mapping from
q-forms to (q − 1)-forms, because terms such as D(i∇φRab) or D(i∇φΦa) do not belong to the set of L(lmn), L(¯lm0)
and L(l ¯m0) presented in (5), (26) and (27) respectively. Thus, D(i∇φL(lmn)) cannot be used.
Alternatively, we could deﬁne the space of exact forms by contracting one of the indices of the Hodge dual basis
with a gradient of the scalar ﬁeld. This is because the Hodge dual basis θ(cid:63)
a1···ak is a (D − k)-form. Thus, adding
one index is equivalent to reducing one order in the diﬀerential form, which is exactly what we were looking for.
This could be seen too as applying the interior product i∇φ only to θ(cid:63)
a1···ak . One should notice that by applying the
interior product to Ψa is an equivalent operation with an extra −2X factor. For all these arguments, we ﬁnd that the
appropriate space of exact forms is

(71)

where the contraction of the last index of the Hodge dual ensures that we have a (D-1)-form inside the exterior
derivative. One should notice that the above expression identically vanishes if n (cid:54)= 0. This is because Ψa = ∇aφDφ
and the antisymmetry of the Hodge dual basis kills it, i.e. θ(cid:63)
ab∇aφ∇bφ = 0. This cancellation will happen again for
any Lagrangian containing Ψ. In contrast to the previous expression, this exact form only generates terms belonging
to L(lmn), L(¯lmn) and L(l ¯mn).
the exact form (71)

Since we have already worked out the action of D in all of the building blocks for the e.o.m., we can easily expand

(lmn)[Gi] = Gi,φL(lm(n+1)) − Gi,XL(l(m+1)n) + Gi

In App. C 3, we include the explicit computation of each of them. We will make full use of these expressions in the
next subsections.

B. Antisymmetric Degeneracies

To continue the analysis of possible degeneracies in the set of Lagrangians, we consider now identities derived from
a1···an . Using its deﬁnition (6), it is easy to prove that Hodge dual bases

the antisymmetry of the Hodge dual basis θ(cid:63)
with diﬀerent number of indices are related by

θa ∧ θ(cid:63)

b1···bk = δa

bk−1θ(cid:63)

b1···bk−2bk + ··· + (−1)k−1δa

(79)

In fact, this identity, rewritten in components via the totally antisymmetric tensor, was used by Horndeski to rewrite
its equations of motion in [31]. Also, it was utilized by Ref. [45] in their study of Lovelock’s theories.

Applying this identity, we observe that it can be used to relate diﬀerent Lagrangians. We conclude that a general

L(lmn) with n = 1 can be related with other Lagrangians with n = 0 through

Since we are working in D = 4, we can ﬁnd nine new identities, i.e.

L(lm1) = −2lL(¯lm0) − mL(l ¯m0) − 2XL(lm0).

L(001) = − 2XL(000),
L(011) = − L(0¯10) − 2XL(010),
L(101) = − 2L(¯100) − 2XL(100),
L(021) = − 2L(0¯20) − 2XL(020),
L(111) = − 2L(¯110) − L(1¯10) − 2XL(110),
L(031) = − 3L(0¯30) − 2XL(030).
L(201) = − 4L(¯200) − 2XL(200) = 0,
L(121) = − 2L(¯120) − 2L(1¯20) − 2XL(120) = 0,
L(041) = − 4L(0¯40) − 2XL(040) = 0.

These 9 new relations together with the previous 6 exact forms add up to a total of 15 constraints. Thus, if we sum all
the possible L(lmn) in D = 4, i.e. 15, and all the possible L(¯lmn) and L(l ¯mn), i.e. 10, we are left with 10 independent
Lagrangians. Among them, there is a certain freedom in the choice, that we summarize in Fig. 1. From all the
possibilities, one could choose to have the six terms of Horndeski theory, i.e. L(000), L(010), L(100), L(020), L(110)
and L(030); the two of Beyond Horndeski’s G3, i.e. L(021) and L(031); and two additional terms, which we choose
to be L(040) and the Gauss-Bonnet term L(200). In the next subsection, we will see how these constraints aﬀect the
Lagrangians that we have found with second order e.o.m., which are the relevant ones at the end.

C. Relations between Second-Order Theories

After computing all the relations that connect diﬀerent terms in our basis of Lagrangians, the key question is: do
these Lagrangians represent any viable/second-order sector diﬀerent from Horndeski? To analyze this point, we will

the interior, which can be either an exact form (73-78), presented with dotted arrows, or an algebraic antisymmetric identity
(81-89), plotted with dashed arrows. Here, a dash-dotted arrow indicates that two Lagrangians are related by both types of
identities. In total, there are 10 independent Lagrangians. In the ﬁgure, we show a possible choice, framing each term in a

L(040) (red dotted rectangles). Finally, we emphasize the structure by levels indicating in the left the number of building blocks

sets of Lagrangians LH

Consequently, the aspect that we need to address is if Eqs. (94-98) contain any dynamics beyond Eqs. (90-93).

Our analysis will be systematic. Starting with the terms with lowest p, we will apply all the exact forms and

antisymmetric redundancies at that level. Then, we will do the same with the next level. We ﬁnd that

Then, we have LN H

Therefore, this result implies that LN H

that we already know that LN H

combination of Horndeski’s theory up to quartic order and L(021). In the discussion, we will extend on this issue.

Therefore, LN H
the one obtained by [52], in which they showed that f (φ)GB belongs to Horndeski using the e.o.m. Here, we
show explicitly that a kinetic Gauss-Bonnet term as LN H
, which contains the case studied by [52], belongs to
Horndeski Lagrangian. Furthermore, from the above expression we also learn that if G5 is only a function of X,
LN H
becomes an exact form itself. We should point out that LN H

not been previously studied in the literature. Here, we have shown that such a new Lagrangian has second order
e.o.m. but its dynamics is already described by Horndeski’s theory.

In conclusion, we have seen that there is a total of ten independent Lagrangians, which can be chosen to be the six
of Horndeski, plus Beyond Horndeski, i.e. L(021) and L(031), plus L(040) and the Gauss-Bonnet L(200). From them,
there are only four independent combinations giving rise to second order e.o.m. This four independent Lagrangians
can be chosen to be the ones of Horndeski, i.e. (90-93). We realize that with this procedure we are not able to
conclude anything whether L(021) and L(031) are well behaved by themselves, as they do in Beyond Horndeski theories
(G3) theory [33]. This would require a Hamiltonian analysis. However, this result tells us that the higher derivative
structure of G3 model, i.e. L(021) and L(031), is precisely the same as the one of L(101) and L(111) respectively. This
seems to indicate that those terms might also be ghost free.

V. DISCUSSION

In this work, we have developed a new formulation for scalar-tensor theories in the language of diﬀerential forms.
We have found a ﬁnite and closed basis that describes general theories of this class in arbitrary dimensions, including
Horndeski and the G3 set of Beyond Horndeski theories. Within this basis, we have been able to systematically
classify the relations between diﬀerent physical theories and to ﬁnd all possible Lagrangians leading to second-order
equations of motion in four as well as arbitrary number of spacetime dimensions. At this point, it is crucial to discuss
the implications of our work in connection to the recent literature.

In the ﬁeld of general scalar-tensor theories, the fundamental analysis was made by Horndeski [31], who found
the most general second order scalar-tensor Euler-Lagrange equations in four dimensions. In practice, Horndeski’s
theorem was ﬁrst proven at the level of the equations of motion, imposing a relation between the divergence of the
metric and the scalar ﬁeld equations arising from diﬀeomorphism invariance. He then classiﬁed all the possible terms
compatible with this requirement and proceeded by ﬁnding an action that produced them in the equations of motion.
In this sense, our work has followed the opposite direction. We have started by looking for the most general action
satisfying invariance under Local Lorentz Transformations in a pseudo-Riemannian manifold and constructed with
a ﬁxed set of building blocks; the vielbein θa, the curvature 2-form Rab, the 1-form Ψa encoding ﬁrst derivatives of
the scalar ﬁeld and the 1-form Φa containing second derivatives linearly. Then, we have looked for the combinations
which give rise to second-order e.o.m. It is important to remark that in this paper we have not proven Horndeski’s
theorem, since, as we have discussed in Sec. II, our basis of Lagrangians can be generalized to higher powers of the
derivatives of the ﬁeld, cf. App. B 1. However, what we have proven is that Horndeski’s theory corresponds to the
most general second order 4-form Lagrangian invariant under LLT in a pseudo-Riemannian manifold and constructed
with θa, Rab, Ψa and Φa. Consequently, Horndeski theorem guarantees that any non-linear extension of our basis
will be either equivalent to it or characterized by higher derivatives e.o.m.

On the one hand, Ref.

N

[56] started from LGal,1

More recently, Horndeski’s theory was encountered in the context of Covariant Galileons [44]. These models are
the curved-space extensions of the Galileon theory [49] described by second order equations of motion. Galileons in
turn represents the most general scalar theory in ﬂat space with only second order derivatives (since the Galileon
symmetry φ → φ + c + bµxµ eliminates all ﬁrst derivatives). This model has diﬀerent formulations that diﬀer only
by total derivatives (exact forms in our notation). The original one, denoted by LGal,1
in [55], corresponds in our
notation to the terms L(0N 1), where N runs from 0 to D − 1. The other relevant formulation, named LGal,3
also in
[55], can be written in the context of this paper as XL(0N 0), where again N = 0,··· , D − 1. From these two version
of the Galileon theory, a curved-space extension has been performed.
. They found a general result in D-dimensions that yields second
order e.o.m. Their result is equivalent to our Lagrangian (54) with n = 1. Since they are considering always terms
with n = 1, they obtain D diﬀerent Lagrangians, provided that 2l + m + 1 ≤ D. On the other hand, Ref. [55] found
a Covariant Galileon theory from LGal,3
. Their result can be written as our Lagrangian (54) with n = 0. Due to
the fact that they wanted to reproduce Galileon theory in ﬂat space, they only considered D diﬀerent Lagrangians.
Therefore, they did not considered the possible second order Lagrangian satisfying 2l + m = D. This Lagrangian
LN H
[E6(φ, X)], which we named kinetic Gauss-Bonnet and presented in (98), has not been previously studied in the
literature. However, we have also shown in this work that its dynamics is already contained in the full Horndeski’s
theory. A particular case of this Lagrangian, when E6 = E6(φ), is the well-known scalar coupling to the Gauss-
Bonnet term f (φ)GB [51]. In this respect, with the previous result, we have additionally proven explicitly that such
a theory belongs to Horndeski, as it was claimed in Ref.
[52]. Interestingly, when there is only kinetic dependence
in the coeﬃcient, i.e. E6 = E6(X), the kinetic Gauss-Bonnet Lagrangian becomes identically an exact form. As an
additional remark, with our set of exact forms and algebraic relation, summarized in Fig. 1, one can easily link the
two covariantized forms of Galileon theory [55, 56]. This relation is not trivial, as pointed out by [55], and it was
missing in the literature.

Lastly, a new line of analysis has been opened for scalar-tensor theories in the last few years. It consists in studying
theories with higher than two time derivatives in the e.o.m. but with hidden constraints that save from Ostrogradski’s
instabilities, implying the existence of viable theories Beyond Horndeski [32]. At the end, the key ingredient to avoid
the pressence of ghosts is to have a degenerate theory [57], as it is clearly explained in [29]. Lagrangians of this type
include the G3 theory [33, 58], which in our notation correspond to L(021) and L(031), cf. (17) and (22) respectively.
Such theories need a Hamiltonian analysis in order to properly disentangle the physical degrees of freedom [59, 60],
and in fact several subtleties can arise to make the theory inviable [61]. Within this work, we have focused in scalar-
tensor theories with second-order Euler-Lagrange equations and we cannot conclude anything about the viability of
this third generation of scalar-tensor theories. However, from our analysis, one learns that the form of this higher
derivative terms in the e.o.m. is the same for L(101) and L(021), and for L(111) and L(031). This fact seems to point out
that L(101) and L(111), given by (16) and (21), will also propagate only the graviton and the scalar ﬁeld. As stressed,
a speciﬁc Hamiltonian analysis in this direction would be needed to conﬁrm this argument.
In the ground of general ﬁeld theoretical studies of gravity, our work could be seen as a scalar-tensor extension
of the analysis of Lovelock’s theory [39] in diﬀerential forms [42] (see a recent review in [45]). Moreover, we have
been able to systematically classify every possible Lagrangian in our basis and present its interconnections with the
others, uncovering the internal structure of the scalar-tensor theories. These relations lead to a minimal basis of ten
independent Lagrangians, of which four independent combinations produce second-order Euler-Lagrange equations.
Along this paper, we have followed the common choice of considering the modern version of Horndeski’s theory as
the basic set, together with the extra Lagrangians present in G3 Beyond Horndeski theories, plus an additional L(200)
and L(040). Ultimatelly this choice of basis is a matter of taste and we want to emphasize the diﬀerent possibilities
through Fig. 1.
As a ﬁnal remark, it is important to note that our formalism greatly simpliﬁes the computations. The fact
that the full e.o.m. of a general scalar-tensor theory can be presented in a few lines is an example of the power
of this new notation. Then, using the dictionary between diﬀerential forms and component notation included in
App. A 3, the connection with the literature is direct. Moreover, the compact diﬀerential form version of the
scalar-tensor Lagrangians compared to the usual tensorial form represents a great advantage. Additionally, the well-
established relations between diﬀerent building blocks through derivative operations allow for a simple connection
between Lagrangians with diﬀerent number of ﬁelds and derivatives. For these reasons, the potential application of
this new formulation for scalar-tensor theories extends to many possible grounds of research interest.

The simplicity aﬀorded by diﬀerential forms encourages a broad range of applications. Our formalism could be
easily adapted to study the role of ﬁeld redeﬁnitions in scalar-tensor theories in a manner analogue to the use of
total derivatives and algebraic relations, extending the scope of previous works and potentially ﬁnding new sets of
equivalences [62–65]. These tools are also suited to analyze other phenomenological and theoretical properties of
scalar-tensor theories: for example, simpliﬁcations of the equations of motion in the presence of symmetries become

19

very transparent in this formalism. Finally, these tools can be applied to a fundamental analysis of the degrees of
freedom present in general Lagrangians, paving the way towards the discovery and characterization of the most general
scalar-tensor theories of gravity.

Appendix A: Notation

The aim of this appendix is to summarize the notation used throughout this work. In order to achieve this task,
we must ﬁrstly review some key concepts about diﬀerential geometry. For a complete and detailed introduction to
this subject, one could read, for instance, Ref.
[50]. Afterwards, we will present particular notation of this work
introduced to simplify the calculations.

1. Diﬀerential Forms

Let us begin with the fundamental building block in which we rewrite our scalar-tensor theory, a diﬀerential q-form.
A q-form is a totally antisymmetric (0, q)-tensor. Due to its antisymmetric character, the space of q-forms, Ωq(M),
(D−q)!q! , where D is the dimension of the space-time manifold M. For convenience, we will
has a ﬁnite dimension
work in a non-coordinate basis θa, assuming, as it is required by physical arguments, that our base manifold M posses
a metric g. Then, we can deﬁne the metric as

D!

g = gµνdxµ ⊗ dxν = ηabθa ⊗ θb,

(A1)

using that θa is related with the cotangent basis vector dxµ through the vielbeins ea
µdxµ. Here, ηab is the
Minkowski metric. Along the work, we will use greek indices to represent coordinate components and latin indices for
non-coordinate ones.

µ by θa = ea

The basic operations that one can build on the space of q-forms Ωq(M) are:
(i) Wedge Product

It is a totally antisymmetric tensor product that maps ∧ : Ωq(M) × Ωr(M) → Ωq+r(M). In components, if we
r! vb1···br θb1 ∧ ··· ∧ θbr , the wedge product of ω and v is given by
start with ω = 1

q! ωa1···aq θa1 ∧ ··· ∧ θaq and v = 1

ω ∧ v =

1

q!r!

ωa1···aq vb1···br θa1 ∧ ··· ∧ θaq ∧ θb1 ∧ ··· ∧ θbr .

(A2)

Importantly, this product posses the property ω ∧ v = (−1)q·rv ∧ ω. Moreover, it can be used to construct

the whole space of q-forms in D-dimensions. In particular, there is only one independent D-form, the volume
element η, which can be written as

η =θ1 ∧ ··· ∧ θD = √−gdx1 ∧ ··· ∧ dxD,

(A3)

where g corresponds to the determinant of the metric tensor gµν. One should notice that the volume element can
D! a1···aD θa1 ∧ ··· ∧ θaD , where a1···aD is the totally antisymmetric symbol. The
be equivalently written as η = 1
term √−g appears due to the antisymmetrization of the vielbeins when we change from θa to dxµ. Naturally,

we can now deﬁne the integral of a function f , i.e. a 0-form, over a manifold M by(cid:82)

M f ∧ η.

(ii) Exterior Derivative

It is a derivative operation that maps d : Ωq(M) → Ωq+1(M). If we introduce the partial derivative 1-form
operator ∂, then the exterior derivative is deﬁned by

dω = ∂ ∧ ω.

(A4)

Relevantly, this derivative satisﬁes a graded Leibniz rule d(ω ∧ v) = (dω) ∧ v + (−1)qω ∧ (dv). Additionally, it
also fulﬁls that d2 = 0. When a q-form α can written in terms of (q − 1)-form β via α = dβ, it is said that α is
an exact form. Whenever we have a q-form ω such that dω = 0, ω is called a closed form.

20

(iii) Interior Product

It is an operation that maps iX : Ωq(M) → Ωq−1(M), where X is a vector ﬁeld. In components, it contracts

the ﬁrst index of the q-form with the vector ﬁeld, i.e.

iX ω =

1

(q − 1)!

X a1ωa1a2···aq θa2 ∧ ··· ∧ θaq .

(A5)

(iv) Hodge Dual

Interestingly, one can now relate the exterior derivative and the Lie derivative through LX ω = iX (dω) + d(iX ω).
It is an operation that arises in manifolds endowed with a metric and maps (cid:63) : Ωq(M) → ΩD−q(M). Its action

on the non-coordinate basis is

(cid:63) (θa1 ∧ ··· ∧ θaq ) =

a1···aq



1

(D − q)!

ap+1···aD θaq+1 ∧ ··· ∧ θaD .

(A6)

Since, we will need this expression many times, we will dub it the Hodge dual basis and denote it by θ(cid:63)
a1···aq . In
addition, this operation is the dual of the wedge product and it can be used to the deﬁne the inner product of

two q-forms α and β by (α, β) =(cid:82) α ∧ (cid:63)β.

2. Diﬀerential Geometry

Once we have introduced the standard operations, we are ready to present the geometrical quantities characterizing
b, which is matrix-valued 1-form. Subsequently, we

a curved manifold. First, we introduce the connection 1-form ωa

(A8)

These equations can be further simpliﬁed if we introduce an exterior covariant derivative D, constructed from the
b. In this notation, we have T a = Dθa and Ra
connection ωa
b. Moreover, Bianchi’s identities, which are just
the result of applying D on Cartan’s structure equations, read

b = Dωa

Additionally, it will be relevant in the calculations the generalized version of Stoke’s theorem,

which summarizes all the usual Calculus integration theorems. With this tool, and assuming that the surface terms
vanish, we will be able to eliminate the exact forms from our Lagrangians.

For the purpose of our physical discussion, we will restrict our analysis to manifolds in which the connection is
uniquely determined by the vielbein, i.e. space-times in which the non-metricity and the torsion vanish (see [53] for a
speciﬁc discussion in more general manifolds). These two conditions translates into the antisymmetry of the 1-form
connection indices, ωab = −ωba, and into T a = 0 respectively. In this context, we will be interested in ﬁnding the
relation between two connections associated to diﬀerent vielbeins. With this result, we will be able to ﬁnd the actual
relation between ωab and θa. We start with a metric compatible and torsionless connection, i.e. ωab = −ωba, and
T a = 0, associated to a given vielbein θa. Then, we deﬁne another connection ˜ωab, which is also metric compatible
and torsionless, arising from a vielbein ˜θa. If we parametrize the diﬀerence between the two connections with a 1-form
X ab = ˜ωab − ωab, the vanishing of the torsion tells us that

˜T a = ˜D ˜θa = D ˜θa + X a

b ∧ ˜θb = 0.

(A12)

Now, using the basic operations of the exterior algebra presented above, we can ﬁnd a unique solution for ˜ωab in terms
of ˜θa that is also metric compatible, i.e.

(cid:16)

,

(A13)

where ˜θa = ˜ea
µdxµ. This result is the diﬀerential form version of the usual tensorial expression for the spin connection
used in supergravity, as it can be found, for instance, in Ref. [53]. If we impose the vielbein postulate, i.e. ∇µea
ν = 0,
this result is directly linked to the Levi-Civita connection Γ(g). The component expression of ˜Γ(˜g) can be found, for
example, in [54].

In this work, the explicit expression of the 1-form connection (A13) will be important because it will allow us to
compute the variation of the connection δωab as a function of the variation of the frame, given by ˜θa = θa + δθa.
Using that T a = Dθa = 0 and keeping at ﬁrst order in the perturbations6, we ﬁnd that

(cid:0)ieb (Dδθa) − iea (Dδθb) + iea (ieb (Dδθc))θc(cid:1) = ∇bδθa − ∇aδθb.

δωab =

(A14)

This relation will be very useful for computing the vielbein e.o.m. in the second order formalism, see Sec. III B.

3. Contractions with the Hodge Dual Basis

Finally, we present the dictionary between the diﬀerential forms language used throughout this work and the
standard tensorial notation appearing in the literature of scalar-tensor theories. For that purpose, we are going to
introduce some extra notation following Ref.
[32]. The possible powers of second derivatives of a scalar ﬁeld φ are
encoded in

Φn

µν = φ;µα1 φ;α1

;α2 ··· φ;αn−1

;ν ,

(A15)

where the covariant derivatives follow ∇µ∇νφ = φ;µν and ∇µφ = φ,µ = ∂µφ. In this context, the Riemann curvature
tensor appear via the commutator of two covariant derivatives acting on a vector, i.e. [∇µ,∇ν]vλ = Rλ
In addition, we denote the contraction of a (0,2)-tensor tµν with the metric, i.e. the trace, by [tµν] ≡ tµνgµν. In
the same fashion, we denote its contraction with ﬁrst derivatives of the scalar ﬁeld by (cid:104)tµν(cid:105) ≡ φ,µtµνφ,ν. Applying
these concepts to the Riemann tensor, we can have, for instance,

γµνvγ.

[Rµν] = Rµνgµν,

(cid:104)Rµν(cid:105) = φ,µRµνφ,ν,

and

(cid:104)RµνργΦνγ(cid:105) = φ,µRµνργΦνγφ,ρ.

(A16)

In the case of the contractions of the second derivatives, we can omit the indices inside the brackets since there is no
ambiguity, i.e.

[Φn] = Φn

µν gµν,

and

(cid:104)Φn(cid:105) = φ,µ Φn

µν φ,ν.

(A17)

Subsequently, we show how to translate a general Lagrangian written in diﬀerential forms, such as (5), in compo-
nents. We simply need to use the deﬁnitions presented before for the Hodge dual basis and the exterior product. One
should notice that, as a Lagrangian consists in a D-form, it is going to be proportional to the volume element η, since
there is only one independent D-form. Then, the component structure of the total set of wedge products can be read

from θa1 ∧ ··· ∧ θaD = a1···aD η. Afterwards, the remaining free indices can be contracted using the deﬁnition of the
Hodge dual basis in (A6). Lastly, we only need to recall the component expression for the diﬀerent building blocks of
bcdθc ∧ θd, Φa = ∇a∇bφθb and Ψa = ∇aφ∇bφθb. Therefore, a general Lagrangian given by
the theory, i.e. Ra
(5) can be written in components as

Appendix B: Generalizations

1. Higher Order Lagrangians

In this appendix, we are going to present a generalization of the basis of Lagrangians L(lmn) introduced in (5). We
are going to consider building blocks for our theory that depend non-linearly on the power of derivatives of the ﬁelds.
In particular, we are going to substitute our 1-form encoding the second derivatives of the scalar Φa, given in (4), by

which contains any possible contraction of the ﬁeld’s second derivatives. Also, we are going to generalize the ﬁrst
derivative 1-form Ψa, deﬁned in (3), to

(Φn)a ≡ Φn a

where Φn a

which shares the same structure of (5) but including any possible higher order 1-form (Φn)a and (Ψmn)a. The
diﬀerence is that, now, for maximum power u, we have u possible building blocks (Φm)a appearing mu times each.
Also, for maximum power v, we have v2 possible building blocks (Ψmn)a appearing nst times each, where s, t < v.

In this more general framework, we can accommodate the extended basis L(¯lmn) and L(l ¯mn) presented in (27) and
= φ,aφ,b Φ bc θc.
The only terms that are not contained are those involving a direct contraction of the curvature 2-form with gradients
of the scalar ﬁeld.

2. Pontryagin Forms

Here, we are going to show the terms that complete the set of Lagrangians L(lmn) to give the most general basis
satisfying invariance under Local Lorentz Transformations in a pseudo-Riemannian manifold and constructed with
the vielbein θa, the curvature 2-form Rab, Ψa and Φa. However, as we are going to argue, they are not very interesting
because they cannot give rise to second order e.o.m.
These extra terms appear by direct contraction of the indices of the building blocks. They are the scalar-tensor
equivalent of the Pontryagin forms in Lovelock-Cartan theories [42]. Since we cannot introduce the Hodge dual basis
θ(cid:63)
a1···ak , they must satisfy that p ≡ 2l + m + n = D. In 4D, we obtain that there are ﬁve possible terms, labeled with
an upper P from Pontryagin, but only three are no zero, i.e.

LP

L(200) = Rab ∧ Rcd ∧ θ(cid:63)
abcd, characterising a pseudo-Riemannian manifold in 4D.
Due to the fact that we have computed the Euler-Lagrange equations for a general L(lmn), we can easily analyze
the case of Pontryagin forms. As we have extensively discussed in Sec. III, there are higher than two derivatives terms
associated with the variation of each Lagrangian that must be canceled, in order to avoid Ostrogradski instabilities.
The case under study now is similar to case studied in which p = 4, where we found two viable combinations LN H
and LN H
, given in (97) and (98). However, there is an important diﬀerent now. Two of the Lagrangians with p = 4
are identically zero, i.e. (B7) and (B8). Consequently, they cannot be used to erase the higher derivative of the other
terms. In conclusion, there cannot be constructed Lagrangians with second order e.o.m. out of the Pontryagin forms.

As it is clear in the above results, any (¯lm1) or (l ¯m1) term is zero since we are contracting two equal vectors with an
antisymmetric tensor (it is the same argument that limits n to be 0 or 1). In addition, the terms of the form (lm¯1)
do not introduce new structures since they are equal to (lm1) with an extra (−2X) factor in front. In total, there are
only 10 independent Lagrangians.

2. Scalar Equations of Motion in 4D

We continue the calculation presented in Sec. III, for the scalar e.o.m.:

Using the commutation of covariant derivatives (29), we can eliminate the unwanted contribution of the higher
derivative terms, underlined with a dashed line. Also we can see that the second term of the last line is identically
zero due to Bianchi’s identity and the antisymmetry of its indices. The only remaining higher order term is
underlined with a solid line.

Then, we have

Doing a similar analysis as before, we can see that the dashed underlined terms add up in the appropriate
way. Moreover, the third terms of both the fourth and last line are well behaved do to the antisymmetry

of their indices. Finally, we are left again with only one higher order contribution, i.e. the solid underlined
term. Remarkably we can eliminate the higher terms of (C23) and (C24) by applying the Bianchi identity (30).
We obtain that this cancellation occurs if F5 = 1
3 G5,X . As in all the previous cases, we also must to impose
G5 = G5(φ, X) to avoid higher than 2nd order terms in the e.o.m. Doing so, we obtain the Lagrangian presented
in Eq. (45).
When n = 1, we also have two diﬀerent contributions, E4L(101) = E4 ∧ Rab ∧ Ψc ∧ θ(cid:63)

Similarly to previous cases, after applying the the commutator of covariant derivatives (29), we are left with
only one higher order contribution. We can eliminate the higher terms of (C25) and (C26) by applying the
Bianchi identity (30). We obtain that this cancellation occurs if H4 = E4,X . As in all the previous cases, we
also must to impose E4 = E4(φ, X) to avoid higher than 2nd order terms in the e.o.m. Thus, we obtain the
Lagrangian presented in Eq. (46).

abcd. As usual, we investigate them one by one.

abcd, E6L(200) = E6 ∧ Rab ∧ Rcd ∧ θ(cid:63)

In this last case, we ﬁnd ﬁve diﬀerent Lagrangians: E5L(111) = E5 ∧ Rab ∧ Φc ∧ Ψd ∧ θ(cid:63)

Continuing with the e.o.m., we analyse the third term. It corresponds to the Gauss-Bonnet Lagrangian, which
only depends on φ through its coeﬃcient E6. Thus, we ﬁnd
