Introduction

For given k-uniform hypergraphs G and H, the Ramsey number R(G, H) is the smallest
positive integer N such that in every red-blue coloring of the edges of the complete k-
uniform hypergraph Kk
N , there is a red copy of G or a blue copy of H. A k-uniform loose
cycle Ck
n (shortly, a cycle of length n) is a hypergraph with vertex set {v1, v2, . . . , vn(k−1)}
and with the set of n edges ei = {v1, v2, . . . , vk} + (i − 1)(k − 1), i = 1, 2, . . . , n, where we
use mod n(k − 1) arithmetic and adding a number t to a set H = {v1, v2, . . . , vk} means
a shift, i.e. the set obtained by adding t to subscripts of each element of H. Similarly,
a k-uniform loose path P k
n (shortly, a path of length n) is a hypergraph with vertex set
{v1, v2, . . . , vn(k−1)+1} and with the set of n edges ei = {v1, v2, . . . , vk} + (i − 1)(k − 1),
i = 1, 2, . . . , n. For an edge ei = {v(i−1)(k−1)+1, v(i−1)(k−1)+2, . . . , vi(k−1)+1} of a given
loose path (also a given loose cycle) K, the ﬁrst vertex (v(i−1)(k−1)+1) and the last vertex
(vi(k−1)+1) are denoted by fK,ei and lK,ei, respectively.
In this paper, we consider the
problem of ﬁnding the 2-color Ramsey number of k-uniform loose paths and cycles for

The investigation of the Ramsey numbers of hypergraph loose cycles was initiated by

extended by Gy´arf´as, S´ark¨ozy and Szemer´edi [1] to k-uniform loose cycles. More precisely,
they proved that for all η > 0 there exists n0 = n0(η) such that for every n > n0, every

In [2], Gy´arf´as and Raeisi determined the value of the Ramsey number of a k-uniform
loose triangle and quadrangle. Recently, we proved the following general result on the
Ramsey numbers of loose paths and loose cycles in 3-uniform hypergraphs.

In [5], we presented another proof of Theorem 1.1 and posed the following conjecture.

Conjecture 1. Let k ≥ 3 be an integer number. For every n ≥ m ≥ 3,

R(P k

n, P k

m) = R(P k

n, Ck

m) = R(Ck

m) + 1 = (k − 1)n + ⌊

Also, the following theorem is obtained on the Ramsey number of loose paths and cycles
in k-uniform hypergraphs [5].

Theorem 1.2. [5] Let n ≥ m ≥ 2 be given integers and R(Ck
Then R(P k
n = m we have R(P k

2 ⌋. Moreover, for

Using Theorem 1.2, one can easily see that Conjecture 1 is equivalent to the following.

Conjecture 2. Let k ≥ 3 be an integer number. For every n ≥ m ≥ 3,

R(Ck

n, Ck

m) = (k − 1)n + ⌊

m − 1

2

⌋.

Recently, it is shown that Conjecture 2 holds for n = m and k ≥ 8 (see [6]). In this
paper, we investigate Conjecture 2 for k = 4, 5. More precisely, we extend the method
that used in [5] and we show that Conjecture 2 holds for k = 4 where n > m or n = m is
odd. When n = m is even we show that R(C4
m) either is the value that is claimed in
Conjecture 2 or is equal to this value minus one. Also, we demonstrate that Conjecture
2 holds for k = 5 when n ≥ ⌊ 3m
2 ⌋. Consequently, using Theorem 1.2, we obtained the
values of some Ramsey numbers involving paths. Throughout the paper, by Lemma 1
of [2], it suﬃces to prove only the upper bound for the claimed Ramsey numbers. The
last section of this paper contains some concluding remarks. Throughout the paper, for
a 2-edge colored hypergraph H we denote by Hred and Hblue the induced hypergraphs on
red edges and blue edges, respectively. Also we denote by |H| and kHk the number of
vertices and edges of H, respectively.

2 Preliminaries

In this section, we prove some lemmas that will be needed in our main results. Also, we
recall some results from [2] and [5].

In order to state our main results we need some deﬁnitions. Let H be a 2-edge colored
complete k-uniform hypergraph for k ≥ 4, P be a loose path in H and W be a set of
vertices with W ∩ V (P) = ∅. By a ̟S-conﬁguration, we mean a copy of P k

2 with edges

{x, a1, a2, . . . , ak−1}, {ak−1, ak, . . . , a2k−3, y},

so that {x, y} ⊆ W and S = {aj : 1 ≤ j ≤ 2k − 3} ⊆ (ei−1 \ {fP,ei−1}) ∪ ei ∪ · · · ∪ ei+k−3 is
a set of unordered vertices of k − 1 consecutive edges of P with |S ∩ (ei−1 \ {fP,ei−1})| ≤ 1.
The vertices x and y are called the end vertices of this conﬁguration. A ̟S-conﬁguration,
S ⊆ (ei−1\{fP,ei−1})∪ei∪· · ·∪ei+k−3, is good if at least one of the vertices of ei+k−3\ei+k−4
is not in S. We say that a monochromatic path P = e1e2 . . . en is maximal with respect to
(w.r.t. for short) W ⊆ V (H) \ V (P) if there is no W ′ ⊆ W so that for some 1 ≤ r ≤ n
and 1 ≤ i ≤ n − r + 1,

P ′ = e1e2 . . . ei−1e′

ie′

i+1 . . . e′

i+rei+r . . . en,

is a monochromatic path with n + 1 edges and the following properties:

(i) V (P ′) = V (P) ∪ W ′,

(ii) if i = 1, then fP ′,e′

i

= fP,ei,

(iii) if i + r − 1 = n, then lP ′,e′

i+r

= lP,en.

Clearly, if P is maximal w.r.t. W , then it is maximal w.r.t. every W ′ ⊆ W and also every
loose path P ′ which is a sub-hypergraph of P is again maximal w.r.t. W .
We use these deﬁnitions to deduce the following essential lemma.

Lemma 2.3. Assume that k ≥ 4 and H = Kk
n is 2-edge colored red and blue. Let P ⊆ Hred
be a maximal path w.r.t. W, where W ⊆ V (H) \ V (P) and |W | ≥ k. For every k − 2
consecutive edges e1, e2, . . . , ek−2 of P there is a good ̟S-conﬁguration, say C = f g,
in Hblue with end vertices x ∈ f and y ∈ g in W and S ⊆ e1 ∪ · · · ∪ ek−3 ∪ ek−2.
Moreover, there are two subsets W1 ⊆ W and W2 ⊆ W with |W1| ≥ |W | − (k − 2) and
|W2| ≥ |W | − (k − 1) so that for every distinct vertices x′ ∈ W1 and y′ ∈ W2, the path

C ′ = (cid:16)(f \ {x}) ∪ {x′}(cid:17)(cid:16)(g \ {y}) ∪ {y′}(cid:17) is also a good ̟S-conﬁguration in Hblue with

end vertices x′ and y′ in W.

Proof. Let

ei = {v(i−1)(k−1)+1, v(i−1)(k−1)+2, . . . , vi(k−1)+1},

i = 1, 2, . . . , k − 2.

Among diﬀerent choices of k − 1 distinct vertices of W, choose a (k − 1)-tuple X =
(x1, x2, . . . , xk−1) so that EX has the minimum number of blue edges, where EX =
{f1, f2, . . . , fk−1} and

f1 = {v1, x1, v2, . . . , vk−2, v(k−3)(k−1)+2},
f2 = {vk−2, x2, vk−1, . . . , v2k−5, v(k−3)(k−1)+3},
...
fk−1 = {v(k−4)(k−1)+3, xk−1, v(k−4)(k−1)+4, . . . , v(k−4)(k−1)+k, v(k−2)(k−1)+1}.

Note that for 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1, we have |fi ∩ (ek−2 \ {fP,ek−2})| = 1. Since P is a max-
imal path w.r.t. W, there is 1 ≤ j ≤ k − 1 so that the edge fj is blue. Otherwise,
replacing e1e2 . . . ek−2 by f1f2 . . . fk−1 in P yields a red path P ′ with n + 1 edges; this
is a contradiction. Let W1 = (W \ {x1, x2, . . . , xk−1}) ∪ {xj}. For each vertex x ∈ W1
the edge fx = (fj \ {xj}) ∪ {x} is blue. Otherwise, the number of blue edges in EY for
Y = (x1, x2, . . . , xj−1, x, xj+1, xk−1), is less than this number for EX, a contradiction.

Now choose distinct vertices uℓ’s for 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ (k − 2)(k − 1) − 1, so that

e1 ∪ · · · ∪ ek−2 \ {v1, v(k−2)(k−1)+1} = {u1, u2, . . . , u(k−2)(k−1)−1},

|hi ∩ (fj \ {xj})| = 1 and |hi ∩ (ek−2 \ (fj ∪ {v(k−3)(k−1)+1}))| ≤ 1, where

h1 = {v1, u1, u2, . . . , uk−2},
h2 = {uk−2, uk−1, uk, . . . , u2k−4},
...
hk−1 = {u(k−2)(k−2), u(k−2)(k−2)+1, . . . , u(k−2)(k−1)−1, v(k−2)(k−1)+1}.

Let Y = (y1, y2, . . . , yk−1) be a (k − 1)-tuple of distinct vertices of W \ {xj} with minimum
number of blue edges in FY , where FY = {g1, g2, . . . , gk−1} and gi = hi ∪ {yi}. Again since
P is maximal w.r.t. W , for some 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ k − 1 the edge gℓ is blue and also, for each vertex
y ∈ W2 = W \{xj, y1, . . . , yℓ−1, yℓ+1, . . . , yk−1} the edge (gℓ \{yℓ})∪{y} is blue. Therefore,
for every x′ ∈ W1 and y′ ∈ W2, we have C = f g which is our desired conﬁguration, where
f = (fj \ {xj}) ∪ {x′} and g = (gℓ \ {yℓ}) ∪ {y′}. Since |W1| = |W | − (k − 2), each vertex
of W, with the exception of at most k − 2, can be considered as an end vertex of C. Note
that this conﬁguration contains at most two vertices of ek−2 \ ek−3.

By an argument similar to the proof of Lemma 2.3, we have the following general

result.

Lemma 2.4. Assume that k ≥ 4 and H = Kk
n, is 2-edge colored red and blue. Let
P ⊆ Hred be a maximal path w.r.t. W, where W ⊆ V (H) \ V (P) and |W | ≥ k. Let
A1 = {fP,e1} and Ai = V (ei−1) \ {fP,ei−1} for i > 1. Then for every k − 2 consecutive

4

edges ei, ei+1, . . . , ek+i−3 of P and for each u ∈ Ai there is a good ̟S-conﬁguration, say
C = f g, in Hblue with end vertices x ∈ f and y ∈ g in W and

S ⊆ (cid:16)(ei \ {fP,ei}) ∪ {u}(cid:17) ∪ ei+1 ∪ ei+2 ∪ · · · ∪ ek+i−4 ∪ (ek+i−3 \ {v}),

for some v ∈ Ak+i−2. Moreover, there are two subsets W1 ⊆ W and W2 ⊆ W with
|W1| ≥ |W | − (k − 2) and |W2| ≥ |W | − (k − 1) so that for every distinct vertices x′ ∈ W1

and y′ ∈ W2, the path C ′ = (cid:16)(f \ {x}) ∪ {x′}(cid:17)(cid:16)(g \ {y}) ∪ {y′}(cid:17) is also a good ̟S-

conﬁguration in Hblue with end vertices x′ and y′ in W.

The following result is an immediate corollary of Lemma 2.4.

Corollary 2.5. Let k ∈ {4, 5} and H = Kk
l be two edge colored red and blue. Also let
P = e1e2 . . . en, n ≥ k − 2, be a maximal red path w.r.t. W, where W ⊆ V (H) \ V (P) and
|W | ≥ k. Then for some r ≥ 0 and W ′ ⊆ W there are two disjoint blue paths Q and Q′,
with kQk ≥ 2 and

kQ ∪ Q′k = 2(n − r)/(k − 2) = 


2(|W ′| − 2)

if kQ′k 6= 0,

2(|W ′| − 1)

if kQ′k = 0,

between W ′ and P = e1e2 . . . en−r so that e ∩ W ′ is actually the end vertex of e for each
edge e ∈ Q ∪ Q′ and at least one of the vertices of en−r \ en−r−1 is not in V (Q) ∪ V (Q′).
Moreover, if kQ′k = 0 then either x = |W \ W ′| ∈ {k − 3, k − 2} or x ≥ k − 1 and
0 ≤ r ≤ k − 3. Otherwise, either x = |W \ W ′| = k − 4 or x ≥ k − 3 and 0 ≤ r ≤ k − 3.

Proof. Let P = e1e2 . . . en be a maximal red path w.r.t. W, W ⊆ V (H) \ V (P), and

ei = {v(i−1)(k−1)+1, v(i−1)(k−1)+2, . . . , vi(k−1)+1},

i = 1, 2, . . . , n,

are the edges of P.

Step 1: Set P1 = P, W1 = W and P 1 = P ′
1 = e1e2 . . . ek−2. Since P is maximal
w.r.t. W1, using Lemma 2.3 there is a good ̟S-conﬁguration, say Q1 = f1g1, in Hblue
with end vertices x ∈ f1 and y ∈ g1 in W1 so that S ⊆ P ′
1 and Q1 does not contain a vertex
of ek−2 \ ek−3, say u1. Set X1 = |W \ V (Q1)|, P2 = P1 \ P 1 = ek−1ek . . . en and W2 = W.
If |W2| = k or kP2k ≤ k − 3, then Q = Q1 is a blue path between W ′ = W1 ∩ V (Q1) and
P = P 1 with desired properties. Otherwise, go to Step 2.

Step 2: Clearly |W2| ≥ k + 1 and kP2k ≥ k − 2. Set P 2 = ek−1ek . . . e2k−4 and P ′

(cid:16)(ek−1 \ {fP,ek−1}) ∪ {u1}(cid:17)ek . . . e2k−4. Since P is maximal w.r.t. W2, using Lemma 2.4

2 =

there is a good ̟S-conﬁguration, say Q2 = f2g2, in Hblue with end vertices x ∈ f2 and
y ∈ g2 in W2 such that S ⊆ P ′
2 and Q2 does not contain a vertex of e2k−4 \ e2k−5, say u2.
By Lemma 2.4, there are two subsets W21 ⊆ W2 and W22 ⊆ W2 with |W21| ≥ |W2|−(k −2)
and |W22| ≥ |W2| − (k − 1) so that for every distinct vertices x′ ∈ W21 and y′ ∈ W22,
the path Q′

2 = (cid:16)(f2 \ {x}) ∪ {x′}(cid:17)(cid:16)(g2 \ {y}) ∪ {y′}(cid:17) is also a good ̟S-conﬁguration in

Hblue with end vertices x′ and y′ in W2. Therefore, we may assume that S2

Clearly |W3| = |W2|. If |W3| ≤ k or kP3k ≤ k − 3, then S2
Q′ (in the case S2

i=1 Qi = Q ∪ Q′) are the paths between W ′ = W ∩ S2

P = P 1 ∪ P 2 with desired properties. Otherwise, go to Step 3.

i=1 Qi = Q and ∅ or Q and
i=1 V (Qi) and

Step ℓ (ℓ > 2): Clearly |Wℓ| ≥ k + 1 and kPℓk ≥ k − 2. Set

Since P is maximal w.r.t. Wℓ, using Lemma 2.4 there is a good ̟S-conﬁguration, say
Qℓ = fℓgℓ, in Hblue with end vertices x ∈ fℓ and y ∈ gℓ in Wℓ such that Qℓ does not contain
a vertex of eℓ(k−2) \ eℓ(k−2)−1, say uℓ. By Lemma 2.4, there are two subsets Wℓ1 ⊆ Wℓ and
Wℓ2 ⊆ Wℓ with |Wℓ1| ≥ |Wℓ| − (k − 2) and |Wℓ2| ≥ |Wℓ| − (k − 1) so that for every distinct
vertices x′ ∈ Wℓ1 and y′ ∈ Wℓ2, the path Q′

Proof. Let C = e1e2 . . . en−1 be a copy of C4

n−1 in Hred with edges

ej = {v3j−2, v3j−1, v3j, v3j+1}

(mod 3(n − 1)),

1 ≤ j ≤ n − 1,

and W = V (H) \ V (C). So we have |W | = t + 3. Consider the following cases:

Case 1. For some edge ei = {v3i−2, v3i−1, v3i, v3i+1}, 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, there is a vertex z ∈
W such that at least one of the edges e = {v3i−1, v3i, v3i+1, z} or e′ = {v3i−2, v3i−1, v3i, z}

We can clearly assume that the edge e = {v3i−1, v3i, v3i+1, z} is red. Set

P = ei+1ei+2 . . . en−1e1e2 . . . ei−2ei−1

and W0 = W \ {z} (If the edge {v3i−2, v3i−1, v3i, z} is red, consider the path

Let W0 = {u1, u2, u3}. We show that Hblue contains C4

f1 = {u1, v3i−3, v3i−1, u2}, f2 = {u2, v3i−4, v3i, u3} and f3 = {u3, z, v3i−2, u1}. Since there
is no red copy of C4
n, the edges f1, f2 and f3 are blue. If not, let the edge fj, 1 ≤ j ≤ 3,
is red. Then fjeei+1 . . . en−1e1 . . . ei−1 is a red copy of C4
n, a contradiction. So f1f2f3 is
n, the path P ′ = ei−3ei−2 (we use
a blue copy of C4
mod (n − 1) arithmetic) is maximal w.r.t. W = W0 ∪ {z}. Using Lemma 2.4, there is

a good ̟S-conﬁguration, say C = f g, in Hblue with end vertices x ∈ f and y ∈ g in W
and S ⊆ ei−3ei−2. Note that, by Lemma 2.4, there are two subsets W1 and W2 of W with
|W1| ≥ 2 and |W2| ≥ 1 so that for every distinct vertices x′ ∈ W1 and y′ ∈ W2, the path

C ′ = (cid:16)(f \ {x}) ∪ {x′}(cid:17)(cid:16)(g \ {y}) ∪ {y′}(cid:17) is also a good ̟S-conﬁguration in Hblue with

end vertices x′ and y′ in W. Clearly, at least one of the vertices of W0, say u1, is an end
vertex of C. Let u ∈ W0 \ V (C). Set g1 = {u2, u3, z, v3i−2} and g2 = {u, v3i−3, v3i−1, u1}.
Since the edge e is red, the edges g1 and g2 are blue (otherwise, we can ﬁnd a red copy of
n) and Cg1g2 is a blue copy of C4
C4
4.

Now let m ≥ 5. Clearly |W0| = t + 2 ≥ 4. Since there is no red copy of C4

n, P is a
maximal path w.r.t. W0. Applying Corollary 2.5, there are two disjoint blue paths Q and
Q′ between P, the path obtained from P by deleting the last r edges for some r ≥ 0, and
W ′ ⊆ W0 with the mentioned properties. Consider the paths Q and Q′ with kQk ≥ kQ′k
so that ℓ′ = kQ ∪ Q′k is maximum. Among these paths choose Q and Q′, where kQk is
maximum. Since kPk = n − 2, by Corollary 2.5, we have r = n − 2 − ℓ′.

Subcase 1. kQ′k 6= 0.
Set T = W0 \ W ′. Let x, y and x′, y′ be the end vertices of Q and Q′ in W ′, respectively.
Using Corollary 2.5, we have one of the following cases:

I. |T | ≥ 2.

It is easy to see that ℓ′ ≤ 2t − 4 and so r ≥ 2. Hence this case does not occur by
Corollary 2.5.

II. |T | = 1.

Let T = {u}. One can easily check that ℓ′ = 2t − 2. If n > m, then r ≥ 2, a
contradiction to Corollary 2.5. Therefore, we may assume that n = m. If n is even,
then ℓ′ = n − 2. Remove the last two edges of Q ∪ Q′ to get two disjoint blue paths
Q and Q′ so that kQ ∪ Q′k = n − 4 and (Q ∪ Q′) ∩ ((ei−2 \ {fP,ei−2}) ∪ ei−1) = ∅
(note that by the proof of Corollary 2.5, this is possible). By Corollary 2.5, there is
a vertex w ∈ ei−3 \ ei−4 so that w /∈ V (Q ∪ Q′). We can without loss of generality
assume that Q = Q. First let kQ′k > 0 and x′, y′′ with y′′ 6= y′ be end vertices of Q′
in W ′. Set

f1 = {y′′, v3i−3, v3i−1, u}, f2 = {u, z, v3i−2, y′}, f3 = {y′, v3i, v3i−4, x}.

Since the edge e is red, then the edges fi, 1 ≤ i ≤ 3, are blue (otherwise we
can ﬁnd a red copy of C4
If the edge f =
{y, w, v3i−7, x′} is blue, then Qf Q′f1f2f3 is a copy of C4
m in Hblue. Otherwise, the
edge g = {y, v3i−6, v3i−5, y′′} is blue (if not, f gei−1 . . . en−1e1 . . . ei−3 is a red copy of
C4
n, a contradiction). Also, since there is no red copy of C4

n, a contradiction to our assumption).

n, the edges

g1 = {x′, v3i−3, v3i−1, u}, g2 = {u, z, v3i−2, y′}, g3 = {y′, v3i, v3i−4, x},

are blue. Clearly QgQ′g1g2g3 is a blue copy of C4
m. Now, we may assume that
kQ′k = 0. In this case, set f ′ = {y, w, v3i−7, x′}. If the edge f ′ is blue, then Qf ′g1g2g3

f ′g′ei−1 . . . en−1e1 . . . ei−3 make a red C4
and the edge e is red,

m. Otherwise, the edge g′ = {y, v3i−6, v3i−5, y′} is blue (if not,
n). Similarly, since there is no red copy of C4
n

Qg′{y′, v3i−3, v3i−1, u}{u, z, v3i−2, x′}{x′, v3i, v3i−4, x},

is a blue copy of C4
m.

Therefore, we may assume that n is odd. Clearly, ℓ′ = n − 3 and r ≥ 1. Again, since
there is no red copy of C4

n, the edges

h1 = {y, v3i−4, v3i−1, x′}, h2 = {y′, v3i−2, z, u}, h3 = {u, v3i, v3i−3, x},

are blue and Qh1Q′h2h3, make a copy of C4
m.

III. |T | = 0.

Clearly we have ℓ′ = 2t. First let m be odd. Therefore, we have ℓ′ = m − 1.
Remove the last two edges of Q ∪ Q′ to get two disjoint blue paths Q and Q′ so that
kQ ∪ Q′k = m − 3 and (Q ∪ Q′) ∩ ((ei−2 \ {fP,ei−2}) ∪ ei−1) = ∅ (this is possible, by
the proof of Corollary 2.5). We can without loss of generality assume that Q = Q.
First let kQ′k > 0 and x′, y′′ with y′′ 6= y′ be end vertices of Q′ in W ′. Since the edge
e is red and there is no red copy of C4

n, the edges

f1 = {y, v3i−3, v3i−1, x′}, f2 = {y′′, v3i−4, v3i, y′}, f3 = {y′, z, v3i−2, x},

Now let m be even. If n > m, then ℓ′ = m − 2 and r ≥ 1. Clearly,

Remove the last two edges of Q ∪ Q′ to get two disjoint blue paths Q and Q′ so
that kQ ∪ Q′k = m − 2 and (Q ∪ Q′) ∩ ((ei−2 \ {fP,ei−2}) ∪ ei−1) = ∅. We can
without loss of generality assume that Q = Q. First let kQ′k > 0 and x′, y′′ with

m.

Subcase 2. kQ′k = 0.
Let x and y be the end vertices of Q in W ′ and T = W0 \ W ′. Using Corollary 2.5 we
have the following:

I. |T | ≥ 3.

In this case, clearly ℓ′ ≤ 2(t − 2) and so r ≥ 2. This is a contradiction to Corollary
2.5.

II. |T | = 2.

Let T = {u1, u2}. So we have ℓ′ = 2t − 2. First let m be odd. Hence, ℓ′ = m − 3
and r ≥ 1. Since there is no red copy of C4

n and the edge e is red, the edges

f1 = {y, v3i−4, v3i−1, u1}, f2 = {u1, v3i−3, v3i, u2}, f3 = {u2, z, v3i−2, x},

Now let m be even. If n > m, then ℓ′ = m − 4 and r ≥ 3. Using Corollary 2.5,
there is a vertex w ∈ ei−4 \ ei−5 so that w /∈ V (Q). Since P is maximal w.r.t. W =
{x, y, u1, u2, z}, using Lemma 2.4, there is a good ̟S-conﬁguration, say C1 = f g, in
Hblue with end vertices x′ ∈ f and y′ ∈ g in W and

S ⊆ (ei−3 \ {v3i−11} ∪ {w}) ∪ ei−2.

1 = (cid:16)(f \ {x′}) ∪ {x′}(cid:17)(cid:16)(g \ {y′}) ∪ {y′}(cid:17) is also a good ̟S-conﬁguration in Hblue

Moreover, by Lemma 2.4, there are two subsets W1 and W2 of W with |W1| ≥ 3
and |W2| ≥ 2 so that for every distinct vertices x′ ∈ W1 and y′ ∈ W2, the path
C ′
with end vertices x′ and y′ in W . Since |W1| ≥ 3 and ℓ′ is maximum, we may assume
that y and z or x and z are end vertices of C1 in W . By symmetry suppose that y
and z are end vertices of C1 in W . Since there is no red copy of C4
n and the edge e
is red, then

Corollary 2.5, there is a vertex w′ ∈ ei−1 \ ei−2 so that w′ /∈ V (Q). Again, since we
don’t have any copy of C4

n in Hred, so

Q{y, u1, v3i−1, w′}{w′, v3i, u2, x},

is a blue copy of C4
m.

III. |T | = 1.

Clearly ℓ′ = 2t. Let T = {u1}. First let m be odd. Therefore, ℓ′ = m − 1. By
Corollary 2.5 there is a vertex w ∈ ei−1 \ ei−2 so that w /∈ V (Q). Clearly the edge
g = {y, w, z, x} is blue (otherwise geei+1 . . . en−1e1 . . . ei−1 make a red copy of C4
n).
m. Now, suppose that m is even. If n > m, then ℓ′ = m − 2
Thereby Qg is a blue C4
and r ≥ 1. Since the edge e is red and there is no red copy of C4
n,

In this case, remove the last
two edges of Q to get two disjoint blue paths Q and Q′ so that kQ ∪ Q′k = m − 2

kQk ≥ kQ′k. First suppose that kQ′k = 0. Then we may suppose that x, y′ with

Qh1h2 form a blue copy of C4
m. So we may assume that kQ′k > 0. Let x′, y′ and
x′′, y′′ be end vertices of Q and Q′ in W ′, respectively. One can easily check that

Q{y′, v3i−3, v3i−1, x′′}Q′{y′′, v3i, v3i−4, x′},

is a blue copy of C4
m.

IV. |T | = 0.

Clearly, we have ℓ′ = 2t + 2. First let m be odd. Therefore, ℓ′ = m + 1. Remove the
last two edges of Q to get two disjoint blue paths Q and Q′ so that kQ ∪ Q′k = m − 1
and (Q∪Q′)∩((ei−2\{fP,ei−2})∪ei−1) = ∅. By symmetry we may assume that kQk ≥
kQ′k. If kQ′k = 0, then we may suppose that x, y′ with y′ 6= y be end vertices of Q in
W ′. Clearly the edge g = {y′, v3i−2, z, x} is blue (otherwise geei+1 . . . en−1e1 . . . ei−1

two edges of Q ∪ Q′. By an argument similar to the before cases we can ﬁnd a blue
copy of C4

emit it here.

Case 2. For every edge ei = {v3i−2, v3i−1, v3i, v3i+1}, 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, and every vertex
z ∈ W , the edges {v3i−1, v3i, v3i+1, z} and {v3i−2, v3i−1, v3i, z} are blue.

Let W = {x1, x2, . . . , xt, u1, u2, u3}. We have two following subcases:

Subcase 1. For some edge ej = {v3j−2, v3j−1, v3j, v3j+1}, 1 ≤ j ≤ n − 1, there are vertices
u and v in W so that at least one of the edges {v3j−2, v3j−1, u, v} or {v3j, v3j+1, u, v} is
blue.
We can without loss of generality assume that the edge {v3j−2, v3j−1, u, v} is blue (if the
edge {v3j, v3j+1, u, v} is blue, the proof is similar). By symmetry we may assume that

Lemma 4.1. Let H = K5
q be 2-edge colored red and blue and P = e1e2 . . . en ⊆ Hblue
be a maximal path w.r.t. W, where W ⊆ V (H) \ V (P) and |W | ≥ 7. For every two
consecutive edges ei and ei+1 of P there is a P 5
3 ⊆ Hred, say Q, with end vertices in W
such that V (Q) ⊆ ei ∪ ei+1 ∪ W, at least one of the vertices of ei+1 \ ei is not in Q and
|W ∩ V (Q)| ≤ 6. Moreover, each vertex of W, with the exception of at most one, can be
considered as an end vertex of Q.

Proof. Let P = e1e2 . . . en be the blue path with edges

ei = {v4i−3, v4i−2, v4i−1, v4i, v4i+1},

1 ≤ i ≤ n.

Also, let ei = {v4i−3, v4i−2, v4i−1, v4i, v4i+1} and ei+1 = {v4i+1, v4i+2, v4i+3, v4i+4,
v4i+5} be two consecutive edges of P and W = {x1, ..., xt}.

Case 1. There exists xi, xj ∈ W such that the edge e = {v4i−3, v4i−2, v4i−1, xi, xj} is blue.

13

Suppose without loss of generality that xi = x1 and xj = x2. If for every vertex x3 ∈
W \ {x1, x2} the edge f1 = {x2, x3, v4i+1, v4i+3, v4i+4} is blue, then for arbitrary vertices
x4, x5, x6, x7 ∈ W \ {x1, x2, x3} the edges

f2 = {x1, x4, v4i+4, v4i+5, v4i+2},
f3 = {v4i+2, v4i−2, x3, x5, v4i},
f4 = {v4i, v4i−1, v4i+1, x6, x7},

are red (since P is maximal w.r.t. W ) and Q = f2f3f4 is the desired path. Note that for
every α 6= 2, xα can be considered as an end vertex of Q. To see that, let x3 /∈ {xα, x1, x2}.
Thereby, for α = 1 we have xα ∈ f2 and otherwise we may assume that xα = x6 (xα ∈ f4).
Now, we may assume that there is a vertex x3 ∈ W \ {x1, x2} so that f1 is red. Again,
since P is maximal w.r.t. W, the path Q = f1f4{v4i−2, v4i, v4i+2, x4, x5} is the desired red
P 5
3 . It is easy to check that for every α 6= 1, xα can be considered as an end vertex of Q.

Case 2. There exists xi, xj ∈ W such that the edge e′ = {v4i−1, v4i, v4i+1, xi, xj} is blue.

Similar to Case 1, assume that xi = x1 and xj = x2. Since P is maximal w.r.t. W,
for every xi ∈ W \ {x1, x2}, 3 ≤ i ≤ 7, the edges g1 = {v4i−3, v4i−2, v4i−1, x3, x4} and
g2 = {v4i−3, v4i, x5, x6, x7} are red (if the edge gj, 1 ≤ j ≤ 2, is blue, replacing the edge
ei by gje′ in the path P, yields a blue path P ′ with n + 1 edges, a contradiction).
If
there is k ∈ {1, 2} such that the edge g3 = {v4i+3, v4i+4, v4i+5, xk, x5} is blue, then for
ℓ ∈ {1, 2} \ {k}, the edge g4 = {v4i+1, v4i+2, v4i+3, x6, xℓ} is red. So Q = g1g2g4 makes the
desired red P 5
3 (it is obvious that for every α 6= k, xα can be seen as an end vertex of Q).
So we may assume that for every k ∈ {1, 2}, the edge g3 is red and Q = g1g2g3 is a red
P 5

3 such that v4i+2 /∈ V (Q) and every xα ∈ W can be considered as an end vertex of Q.

For every x1, x2, x3, x4 ∈ W, the edges e = {v4i−3, v4i−2, v4i−1, x1, x2} and

Case 3.
e′ = {v4i−1, v4i, v4i+1, x3, x4} are red.
We may assume for every k 6= j, 1 ≤ j ≤ 4, the edge h1 = {x4, v4i+3, v4i+4, v4i+5, xk}
is red and so Q = ee′h1 is the desired path (note that v4i+2 /∈ V (Q)).
If not, since
P is maximal w.r.t. W, for every vertices xℓ, xℓ′ ∈ W \ {x1, x2, x3, x4, xk} the edge
h2 = {v4i+1, v4i+2, v4i+3, xℓ, xℓ′} is red and Q = ee′h2 is the desired path (note that, in
this case, every vertex of W can be considered as an end vertex of Q).

By an argument similar to the proof of Lemma 4.1, we have the following general

lemma.

Lemma 4.2. Let H = K5
q be 2-edge colored red and blue and P = e1e2 . . . en ⊆ Hblue be a
maximal path w.r.t. W, where W ⊆ V (H) \ V (P) and |W | ≥ 7. Assume that A1 = {fP,e1}
and Ai = V (ei−1) \ {fP,ei−1} for i > 1. Then for every two consecutive edges ei and ei+1
of P and for each u ∈ Ai, there is a P 5
3 ⊆ Hred, say Q, with end vertices in W such that
V (Q) ⊆ ((ei \ {fP,ei}) ∪ {u}) ∪ ei+1 ∪ W, at least one of the vertices of Ai+2 is not in Q
and |W ∩ V (Q)| ≤ 6. Moreover, each vertex of W, with the exception of at most one, can
be considered as an end vertex of Q.

We shall use Lemmas 4.1 and 4.2 to prove the following basic lemma.

Set W = V (K5

t ) \ V (C). We have two following cases.

Case 1. For some edge ei = {v4i−3, v4i−2, v4i−1, v4i, v4i+1}, 1 ≤ i ≤ m − 1, there
are two vertices u, v ∈ W such that at least one of the edges {v4i−1, v4i, v4i+1, u, v} or
{v4i−3, v4i−2, v4i−1, u, v} is blue.

We can without loss of generality assume that the edge e = {v4i−1, v4i, v4i+1, u, v} is blue.
Set

P = ei+1ei+2 . . . em−1e1e2 . . . ei−2ei−1

and W0 = W \ {u, v} (if the edge {v4i−3, v4i−2, v4i−1, u, v} is blue, consider the path
P = ei−1ei−2 . . . e2e1em−1 . . . ei+2ei+1 and do the following process to get a red copy of
C5
n−1).
Let m = 2k + l, where l = 0, 1. For 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1, do the following process.

Step 1: Set P1 = P = g1g2 . . . gm−2, W1 = W0 and P ′
w.r.t. W1, using Lemma 4.1, there is a red path P 5

1 = W1 ∩ V (Q1). By Lemma 4.1, we have |W ′

Step i (2 ≤ i ≤ k − 1): Set Pi = Pi−1 \ P i−1 = g2i−1g2i . . . gm−2, P ′

is maximal w.r.t. Wi, using Lemma 4.2, there is a red path P 5
3 , say Qi, with mentioned
properties so that V (Qi) ⊆ V (P ′
i) ∪ Wi and Qi does not contain a vertex of g2i \ g2i−1,
say ui. Since each vertex of Wi, with the exception of at most one, can be considered as

Therefore we have two subcases.

i=1 Qi is a red path of length 3k − 3 with end vertices xk−1, yk−1 in

Subcase 1. m = 2k.
Since |W0| = 5k + 1, we have |W ′| ≥ 5. Let {u1, u2, . . . , u5} ⊆ W ′ and z be a vertex of
gm−2 \ gm−3 (ei−1 \ ei−2) so that z /∈ V (Q). Since there is no blue copy of C5
m and the
edge e is blue, the edges

f1 = {yk−1, u1, u2, v4i−1, z}, f2 = {z, v4i−2, u, u3, xk−1},

are red and Qf1f2 is a red copy of C5

n−1 (note that n = 3k).

15

Subcase 2. m = 2k + 1.
In this case we have n = 3k + 1 and |W ′| ≥ 6. Let {u1, u2, . . . , u6} ⊆ W ′. Also we have
(ei−1 \ {fP,ei−1}) ∩ V (Q) = ∅. Since there is no blue copy of C5
m and the edge e is blue, the
edges

g1 = {yk−1, v4i−4, v4i−1, u1, u2}, g2 = {u2, u3, u4, v4i−5, v4i},

are red and Qg1g2g3 is a copy of C5

n−1 in Hred.

g3 = {v4i, v4i−3, u5, u6, xk−1},

Case 2. For every edge ei = {v4i−3, v4i−2, v4i−1, v4i, v4i+1}, 1 ≤ i ≤ m − 1, and every
vertices u, v ∈ W the edges {v4i−1, v4i, v4i+1, u, v} and {v4i−3, v4i−2, v4i−1, u, v} are red.

5k + 3 if m = 2k,

5k + 4 if m = 2k + 1.

Now let W ′ = {x1, x2, . . . , x5k+3} ⊆ W . For 0 ≤ j ≤ k − 2 and 1 ≤ l ≤ 3, set

(e2j+1 \ {v8j+4, v8j+5}) ∪ {x5j+1, x5j+2} if l = 1,

(e2j+1 \ {v8j+1, v8j+2}) ∪ {x5j+3, x5j+4} if l = 2,

(e2j+2 \ {v8j+5, v8j+6}) ∪ {x5j+4, x5j+5} if l = 3,

e2j+1 = {v8j+1, v8j+2, v8j+3, v8j+4, v8j+5}, e2j+2 = {v8j+5, v8j+6, v8j+7, v8j+8, v8j+9}.

Set W = V (H) \ V (C). We have the following cases.

16

Case 1. For some edge ei = {v4i−3, v4i−2, v4i−1, v4i, v4i+1}, 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, there
are vertices z1, z2 ∈ W such that at least one of the edges {v4i−1, v4i, v4i+1, z1, z2} or
{v4i−3, v4i−2, v4i−1, z1, z2} is red.

We can without loss of generality assume that there are vertices z1, z2 ∈ W so that the
edge e = {v4i−1, v4i, v4i+1, z1, z2} is red. Set

P = ei+1ei+2 . . . en−1e1e2 . . . ei−2ei−1

and W0 = W \ {z1, z2}. If the edge {v4i−3, v4i−2, v4i−1, z1, z2} is red, then consider the
path

P = ei−1ei−2 . . . e2e1en−1 . . . ei+2ei+1

and do the following procedure to get a blue copy of C5
m.

First let m = 4. Hence we have n ≥ 6 and |W0| = 3. Let W0 = {u1, u2, u3}. Since
there is no red copy of C5
n, P is a maximal path w.r.t. W . Applying Lemma 2.3, there is a
good ̟S-conﬁguration, say C1, in Hblue with end vertices in W so that S ⊆ ei−4ei−3ei−2.
Since C1 is a good ̟S-conﬁguration, there is a vertex w ∈ ei−2 \ ei−3 so that w /∈ V (C1).
We have two following cases.

(i) V (C1) ∩ W0 6= ∅.

Assume that u1 ∈ V (C1) ∩ W0. Since |W0| = 3, we have W0 \ V (C1) 6= ∅. Suppose
that u2 ∈ W0 \ V (C1). Let f = {u1, w, v4i−6, v4i−5, u2}. If the edge f is blue, then
set

g1 = {u2, v4i−3, v4i−2, u3, z1},
g2 = {u2, v4i−3, v4i−2, u3, z2}.

Since there is no red copy of C5
n and the edge e is red, then the edges g1 and g2
are blue. Clearly at least one of C′ = C1f g1 or C′′ = C1f g2 is a blue copy of
C5
4. So we may assume that the edge f is red. If {z1, z2} ∩ V (C1) 6= ∅, then set
g = {u2, v4i−4, v4i−3, z1, z2}. The edge g is blue (otherwise, f geiei+1 . . . en−1e1 . . . ei−2
is a red copy of C5
n and
the edge e is red, C1g{v4i−3, v4i−2, v4i−1, u3, u1} is a blue copy of C5
4 . Otherwise,
{z1, z2} ∩ V (C1) = ∅. Therefore, u1 and u3 are end vertices of C1 in W. Clearly

n, a contradiction). Again, since there is no red copy of C5

C1{u1, z1, z2, v4i−4, v4i−3}{v4i−3, v4i−2, v4i−1, u2, u3}

is a blue copy of C5
4 .

(ii) V (C1) ∩ W0 = ∅.

Therefore z1 and z2 are end vertices of C1 in W . Let f = {z1, w, v4i−6, v4i−5, u1}. If
the edge f is blue, then

C1f {u1, u2, v4i−3, v4i−2, z2},

is a blue copy of C5
n, the edge g =
{z1, u2, u3, v4i−4, v4i−3} is blue and C1g{u2, u1, v4i−5, v4i−2, z2} is a blue copy of C5
4 .

4 . Otherwise, since there is no red copy of C5

17

Now let m = 5. Therefore, we have n ≥ 7 and |W0| = 4. Let W0 = {u1, . . . , u4}. Since
n, P is a maximal path w.r.t. W ′ = W0 ∪ {z1}. Applying Lemma
there is no red copy of C5
2.3, there is a good ̟S-conﬁguration, say C2, in Hblue with end vertices in W ′ so that
S ⊆ ei−5ei−4ei−3. Since C2 is a good ̟S-conﬁguration, there is a vertex w ∈ ei−3 \ ei−4
so that w /∈ V (C2). Clearly V (C2) ∩ W0 6= ∅. By symmetry we may assume that u1 is an
end vertex of C2 in W0. Since |V (C2) ∩ W ′| = 2, we have |W0 \ V (C2)| ≥ 2. Without loss
of generality suppose that u2, u3 ∈ W0 \ V (C2). Let f ′ = {u1, v4i−9, v4i−10, w, u2}. If the
edge f ′ is blue, then set

C′ = C2f ′{u2, v4i−7, v4i−6, v4i−5, u3}{u3, u4, z1, v4i−3, v4i−2},
C′′ = C2f ′{u2, u3, v4i−1, v4i−2, v4i−3}{v4i−3, v4i−4, v4i−5, z1, u4}.

5 . So we may assume that the edge f ′ is
Clearly at least one of C′ or C′′ is a blue copy of C5
n, the edge g′ = {u1, u3, z2, v4i−7, v4i−8} is blue. If the
red. Since there is no red copy of C5
edge g′′ = {u3, v4i−9, v4i−6, v4i−5, u2} is blue, then C2g′g′′{u2, v4i−3, v4i−2, z1, u4} is a blue
copy of C5

5 . Otherwise,

C2g′{u3, u2, v4i−1, v4i−2, v4i−3}{v4i−3, v4i−4, v4i−5, z1, u4}

is a blue copy of C5
5 .

Now let m = 6. So we have n ≥ 9 and |W0| = 4. Since P is maximal w.r.t. W , using
Lemma 2.3 there is a good ̟S-conﬁguration, say Q1, in Hblue with end vertices x1 and y1 in
W so that S ⊆ ei−7 ∪ei−6∪ei−5 and Q1 does not contain a vertex of ei−5 \ei−6, say u. Now,
Since P is maximal w.r.t. W \{x1}, using Lemma 2.4 there is a good ̟S-conﬁguration, say

Q2, in Hblue with end vertices in W \{x1} so that S ⊆ (cid:16)(ei−4 \{fP,ei−4})∪{u}(cid:17)∪ei−3∪ei−2

and Q2 does not contain a vertex of ei−2 \ ei−3, say u′. Clearly, Q1 ∪ Q2 is either a blue
path of length 4 or the union of two disjoint blue paths of length 2. First consider the
case Q1 ∪ Q2 is a blue path, say Q, of length 4 with end vertices x1 and y2 in W . It is
easy to see that one of the following cases holds.

(i) |{x1, y2} ∩ {z1, z2}| = 0

In this case, obviously |V (Q) ∩ {z1, z2}| ≤ 1. By symmetry we may suppose that
z2 /∈ V (Q). Since |W0| = 4, we have |W0 \ V (Q)| ≥ 1. Let u1 ∈ W0 \ V (Q). Consider
the edge f = {y2, u′, v4i−6, v4i−5, u1}.
If the edge f is blue, since there is no red
copy of C5
n and the edge e is red, then Qf {u1, v4i−3, v4i−2, z2, x1} is a blue copy of
C5
6. Otherwise, set T = W \ (V (Q) ∪ {u1}). So we have z2 ∈ T and |T | = 2. The
edge f ′ = {y2, v4i−4, v4i−3} ∪ T is blue (otherwise, f f ′eiei+1 . . . en−1e1 . . . ei−2 is a
n, a contradiction). Thereby, Qf ′{v4i−3, v4i−2, v4i−1, u1, x1} is a blue
red copy of C5
copy of C5
6 .

(ii) |{x1, y2} ∩ {z1, z2}| = 1

By symmetry we may assume that y2 = z1. Since |W0| = 4 and |W ∩ V (Q)| =
3, we have |W0 \ V (Q)| ≥ 2. Let u1 ∈ W0 \ V (Q). Consider the edge f =
{y2, u′, v4i−6, v4i−5, u1}.
If the edge f is blue, then Qf {u1, v4i−3, v4i−2, v4i−1, x1}
is a blue copy of C5
6 . Otherwise, set T = W \ (V (Q) ∪ {u1}). Clearly, the edge

18

f ′ = {y2, v4i−4, v4i−3} ∪ T is blue and thereby, Qf ′{v4i−3, v4i−2, v4i−1, u1, x1} is a
blue copy of C5
6 .

(iii) |{x1, y2} ∩ {z1, z2}| = 2

In this case, clearly |W0 \ V (Q)| = 3. Set T = W0 \ V (Q) = {u1, u2, u3}.
If
the edge f = {y2, u′, v4i−6, v4i−5, u1} is blue, then Qf {u1, v4i−3, v4i−2, u2, x1} is a
blue copy of C5
6. Otherwise, the edge f ′ = {y2, v4i−4, v4i−3, u2, u3} is blue and
Qf ′{u3, u1, v4i−5, v4i−2, x1} is a blue copy of C5
6.

Now let Q1 and Q2 are two disjoint blue paths with end vertices x1, y1 and x2, y2 in

W, respectively. We have the following cases.

(i) |{x1, y1, x2, y2} ∩ {z1, z2}| = 0

Let f = {y1, u′, v4i−6, v4i−5, x2}. If the edge f is blue, since there is no red copy of
C5
n and the edge e is red, then

Q1f Q2{y2, v4i−3, v4i−2, v4i−1, x1},

is a blue copy of C5
not, we can ﬁnd a red copy of C5
is a blue copy of C5
6 .

6. Otherwise, the edge f ′ = {x1, v4i−5, v4i−4, v4i−3, y2} is blue (if

n, a contradiction). Thereby, Q1f ′Q2{x2, v4i−6, v4i−2, v4i−1, y1}

(ii) |{x1, y1, x2, y2} ∩ {z1, z2}| ≥ 1

By symmetry we may assume that y2 = z1. Clearly |W0\V (Q1 ∪Q2)|, |W0 ∩V (Q1)| ≥
1. We can without loss of generality suppose that u1 ∈ W0 \ V (Q1 ∪ Q2) and x1 ∈
W0 ∩ V (Q1). If the edge f = {y1, u′, v4i−6, v4i−5, y2} is blue, then set

g = {x2, v4i−3, v4i−2, u1, x1},
g′ = {x2, v4i−3, v4i−2, v4i−1, x1}.

n, a contradiction). Otherwise, the edge g′ is blue (if not, g′eei+1 . . . en−1e1 . . . ei−1

6 (if not, geei+1 . . . en−1e1 . . . ei−1 is a red

n) and Q1f Q2g′ is a blue copy of C5
6 .

If x2 = z2, then Q1f Q2g is a blue copy of C5
copy of C5
is a red copy of C5
Therefore, we may assume that the edge f is red. Since there is no red copy of C5
n, the
edges h1 = {x1, v4i−5, v4i−4, v4i−3, x2} and h2 = {y1, v4i−4, v4i, u1, x2} are blue (if the
edge hj, 1 ≤ j ≤ 2, is red, then f hjei . . . en−1e1 . . . ei−2 is a red copy of C5
n). If y1 6= z2,
then Q1h1Q2{y2, u1, v4i−2, v4i−6, y1} is a blue copy of C5
6 . If y1 = z2, then there is a
vertex u2 ∈ W0 \ (V (Q1 ∪ Q2) ∪ {u1}) and clearly Q1h2Q2{y2, v4i−3, v4i−2, u2, x1} is
a blue copy of C5
6 .

For every edge ei = {v4i−3, v4i−2, v4i−1, v4i, v4i+1}, 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, and every
Case 2.
vertices z1, z2 ∈ W the edges {v4i−1, v4i, v4i+1, z1, z2} and {v4i−3, v4i−2, v4i−1, z1, z2} are

Also, let W = V (H) \ V (C). We have the following cases:

For some edge ei = {v4i−3, v4i−2, v4i−1, v4i, v4i+1}, 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, there are

vertices z1, z2 ∈ W and v′ ∈ ei+1 \ {lC,ei+1} (resp. z1, z2 ∈ W and v′ ∈ ei−1 \ {fC,ei−1})
such that the edge {v4i−1, v4i, v′, z1, z2} (resp. the edge {v′, v4i−2, v4i−1, z1, z2}) is red.
We can without loss of generality assume that there are vertices z1, z2 ∈ W and v′ ∈

the edge {v′, v4i−2, v4i−1, z1, z2} is red, consider the path

P = ei−1ei−2 . . . e1en−1en−2 . . . ei+2ei+1

and repeat the following procedure to get a blue copy of C5
m.

Since m ≥ 7, we have |W0| = ⌊ m−1

2 ⌋ + 2 ≥ 5. Also, since there is no red copy of
C5
n, P is a maximal path w.r.t. W0. Applying Corollary 2.5, there are two disjoint blue

If the edge h1 is blue, then Qh′Q′h1{u1, v4i−3, v4i−2, v4i−1, y} is a blue copy of C5

Therefore, we may assume that the edge h1 is red. Since there is no red copy of C5

the edge h2 is blue and Qh′Q′h2{v4i−3, v4i−2, v4i−1, u1, y} is a blue copy of C5

Using Lemma 2.4 and since ℓ′ is maximum, we may assume that y′ and z1 are end
vertices of C1. Let h = {z1, v4i−5, v4i−6, w, x}. If the edge h is blue then

Q′C1hQ{y, v4i−3, v4i−2, v4i−1, x′}

is a blue copy of C5
clearly

m. Otherwise, the edge h′ = {z1, z2, v4i−4, v4i−3, y} is blue and

Q′C1h′Q{x, v4i−5, v4i−2, v4i−1, x′}

is a copy of C5

m in Hblue.

We can clearly observe that ℓ′ = 2⌊ m−1
2 ⌋. If m is even, then ℓ′ = m − 2 and r ≥ 1.
By Corollary 2.5, there is a vertex w ∈ ei−2 \ ei−3 so that w /∈ V (Q ∪ Q′). Since
there is no red copy of C5

n and the edge e is red, the edges

g = {y′, v4i−3, v4i−2, v4i−1, x},
g′ = {x′, v4i−3, v4i−2, v4i−1, y},

are blue. If the edge f = {y, w, v4i−6, v4i−5, x′} is blue, then Qf Q′g is a blue copy
of C5
m. Therefore, we may assume that the edge f is red. Thereby the edge f ′ =
{x, v4i−5, v4i−4, v4i, y′} is blue (if not, f f ′ei . . . en−1e1 . . . ei−2 is a red copy of C5
n, a
contradiction) and Qf ′Q′g′ is desired C5
m.
If m is odd, then ℓ′ = m − 1. Remove the last two edges of Q ∪ Q′ to get two disjoint
blue paths Q and Q′ so that V (Q ∪ Q′) ∩ (ei−2 ∪ ei−1) = ∅. We can without loss of
generality assume that Q = Q. First let kQ′k > 0 and x′, y′′ with y′′
6= y′ be the
end vertices of Q′ in W ′. Since there is no red copy of C5
n and the edge e is red, the
edges

g1 = {y′, v4i−3, v4i−2, v4i−1, x},
g2 = {y′, v4i−3, v4i−2, v4i−1, y},

are blue. Consider the edge h1 = {y, v4i−11, v4i−10, v4i−9, x′}. If the edge h1 is blue,
then at least one of C1 or C2 is the desired blue cycle, where

C1 = Qh1Q′{y′′, v4i−7, v4i−6, v4i−5, y′}g1,
C2 = Qh1Q′{y′′, z1, z2, v4i−4, v4i−3}g1.

So we may assume that the edge h1 is red. Then, since there is no red copy of C5
n,
the edge h2 = {x, v4i−9, v4i−8, v4i−7, y′′} is blue. Clearly, at least one of C3 or C4 is
the desired blue cycle, where

C3 = Qh2Q′{x′, v4i−10, v4i−6, v4i−5, y′}g2,
C4 = Qh2Q′{x′, z1, z2, v4i−4, v4i−3}g2.

If kQ′k = 0, by some discussions similar to the above, we can ﬁnd a blue copy of C5
m.
So we omit it’s proof here.

Subcase 2. kQ′k = 0.
Let x and y be the end vertices of Q in W ′ and T = W0 \ W ′. Using Corollary 2.5, we
have one of the following cases:

I. |T | ≥ 4.

Since ℓ′ ≤ 2⌊ m−1

II. |T | = 3.

3 (n − 2 − r) and n ≥ ⌊ 3m

Let T = {u1, u2, u3}. Clearly ℓ′ = 2⌊ m−1
2 ⌋ − 4. First let m be odd. There-
fore, ℓ′ = m − 5. Since ℓ′ = 2
2 ⌋, we have r ≥ 5. Let
W = {x, y, z1, z2, u1, u2, u3} and v ∈ ei−6 \ ei−7 be a vertex so that v /∈ V (Q)
(the existence of v is guaranteed by Corollary 2.5). Using Lemma 2.4, there is
a good ̟S-conﬁguration, say C1, in Hblue with end vertices in W so that S ⊆
(ei−5 \ {fP,ei−5} ∪ {v})ei−4ei−3 and at least one of the vertices of ei−3 \ ei−4, say
w, is not in C1. By Lemma 2, each vertex of W with the exception of at most
three can be considered as an end vertex of C1. Since ℓ′ is maximum, by symme-
try, we may assume that y and z1 are the end vertices of C1 in W .
If the edge
f = {u1, w, v4i−10, v4i−9, x} is blue, then set

g1 = {u2, v4i−5, v4i−6, v4i−7, u1},
g2 = {z1, v4i−5, v4i−4, u3, v4i−3}.

First let the edge g1 is blue. Since there is no red copy of C5
n and the edge e is red, the
cycle g1f QC1{z1, v4i−3, v4i−2, u3, u2} is a blue copy of C5
m. So we may assume that the
edge g1 is red. Therefore, the edge g2 is blue (otherwise, g1g2eiei+1 . . . en−1e1 . . . ei−2
is a red copy of C5
n, a contradiction to our assumption). Again, since there is no
red copy of C5
n and the edge e is red, the edge g3 = {v4i−3, v4i−2, v4i−1, u2, u1} is
blue (otherwise, g3eei+1 . . . en−1e1 . . . ei−1 is a red copy of C5
n, a contradiction) and
f QC1g2g3 is a blue copy of C5
m. Now suppose that the edge f is red. Then the edge
f ′ = {u3, v4i−7, v4i−8, v4i−9, z1} is blue (otherwise, f f ′ei−1ei . . . en−1e1 . . . ei−3 is a
red copy of C5

n, a contradiction). Consider the edges

h1 = {u2, v4i−5, v4i−6, v4i−10, u3},
h2 = {x, u1, v4i−5, v4i−4, v4i−3}.

If the edge h1 is blue, then h1f ′C1Q{x, v4i−3, v4i−2, v4i−1, u2} is a blue copy of C5
m.
So suppose that the edge h1 is red. Therefore, the edge h2 is blue (otherwise,
h1h2eiei+1 . . . en−1e1 . . . ei−2 is a red copy of C5
n, a contradiction). Again, since there
n and the edge e is red, the cycle f ′C1Qh2{v4i−3, v4i−2, v4i−1, u2, u3}
is no red copy of C5
is a blue copy of C5
m.

Now, let m be even. Hence, we have ℓ′ = m−6 and r ≥ 7. Let W = {x, y, z1, z2, u1, u2, u3}
and v ∈ ei−8 \ ei−9 be a vertex so that v /∈ V (Q) (the existence of v is guaranteed
by Corollary 2.5). Using Lemma 2.4, there is a good ̟S1-conﬁguration, say C1,
in Hblue with end vertices in W so that S1 ⊆ (ei−7 \ {fP,ei−7} ∪ {v})ei−6ei−5 and
at least one of the vertices of ei−5 \ ei−6, say w, is not in C1. By an argument
similar to case odd m, we may assume that y and z1 are the end vertices of C1

in W . Now set fW = W \ {y} = {x, z1, z2, u1, u2, u3}. Again, using Lemma 2.4,
there is a good ̟S2-conﬁguration, say C2, in Hblue with end vertices in fW so that
may assume that x and z2 or z2 and u1 are end vertices of C2 in fW . It is not diﬃcult

S2 ⊆ (ei−4 \ {fP,ei−4} ∪ {w})ei−3ei−2 and at least one of the vertices of ei−2 \ ei−3,
say w′, is not in C2. By the properties of Lemma 2.4 and since ℓ′ is maximum, we

III. |T | = 2.

Let T = {u1, u2}. Since ℓ′ = 2⌊ m−1
2 ⌋ − 2, for odd m we have ℓ′ = m − 3 and r ≥ 2.
By Corollary 2.5, there is a vertex w ∈ ei−3 \ ei−4 so that w /∈ V (Q). If the edge
f = {y, w, v4i−10, v4i−9, u1} is blue, then set

g1 = {u1, z1, z2, v4i−4, v4i−3},
g2 = {u1, v4i−7, v4i−6, v4i−5, u2}.

n, at least one of the edges g1 or g2, say g′, is blue
Since there is no red copy of C5
(otherwise, g2g1eiei+1 . . . en−1e1 . . . ei−2 is a red copy of C5
n). Now, since that edge
e is red, the cycle C1 = Qf g′{v4i−3, v4i−2, v4i−1, u2, x} is a blue copy of C5
m. So we
may assume that the edge f is red. Therefore, since there is no red copy of C5
n, the
edge g = {x, v4i−9, v4i−8, v4i−7, u2} is blue and at least one of C3 or C4 is a blue copy
of C5

m, where

C3 = Qg{u2, u1, v4i−1, v4i−2, v4i−3}{v4i−3, v4i−4, v4i−5, z1, y},
C4 = Qg{u2, v4i−10, v4i−6, v4i−5, u1}{u1, v4i−3, v4i−2, v4i−1, y}.

Now, we may assume that m is even. Consequently, ℓ′ = m − 4 and r ≥ 4. Let
W = {x, y, z1, z2, u1, u2} and u be a vertex of ei−5 \ ei−6 so that u /∈ V (Q). Using
Lemma 2.4, there is a good ̟S-conﬁguration, say C1, in Hblue with end vertices
in W so that S ⊆ ((ei−4 \ {fP,ei−4}) ∪ {u})ei−3ei−2. Let w ∈ ei−2 \ ei−3 so that
w /∈ C1. Since ℓ′ is maximum, then u1, u2 or uj, x or uj, y for 1 ≤ j ≤ 2 can not be
end vertices of C1. By symmetry we may assume that one of the following cases holds:

(i) y and z1 are the end vertices of C1 (when y, z2 or x, z1 or x, z2 are end vertices
of C1 the proof is similar to this case).

If the edge f = {u1, v4i−5, v4i−6, w, x} is blue, then QC1{z1, v4i−2, v4i−3, u2, u1}f is
a blue copy of C5
m. So we may suppose that the edge f is red. Since there is no red
copy of C5

n, the edge f ′ = {z1, u2, v4i−5, v4i−4, v4i−3} is blue and

QC1f ′{v4i−3, v4i−2, v4i−1, u1, x},

is a blue copy of C5
m.

(ii) u2 and z1 are the end vertices of C1 (when u2, z2 or u1, z1 or u1, z2 are end
vertices of C1 the proof is similar to this case).

If the edge f = {y, w, v4i−6, v4i−5, u2} is blue, then Qf C1{z1, v4i−3, v4i−2, u1, x} is a
m. Otherwise, Qf ′C1{u2, z2, v4i−2, v4i−3, y} is our desired cycle, where
blue copy of C5
f ′ = {x, v4i−5, v4i−4, v4i−1, z1}.

24

IV. |T | = 1.

Let T = {u1}. One can easily check that ℓ′ = 2⌊ m−1
2 ⌋. If m is odd, then ℓ′ = m − 1.
Let w be a vertex of ei−1 \ ei−2 so that w /∈ V (Q)(the existence of w is guaranteed
by Corollary 2.5). Since there is no red copy of C5
n and the edge e is red, the cycle
Q{y, u1, v4i−1, w, x} is a blue copy of C5
m.
Now, we may assume that m is even. So ℓ′ = m − 2 and r ≥ 1. Let w be a vertex
of ei−2 \ ei−3 so that w /∈ V (Q). Since there is no red copy of C5
n at least one of the
edges

g1 = {y, w, v4i−6, v4i−5, u1},
g2 = {x, v4i−5, v4i−4, z1, v4i−3},

is blue (if not, g1g2eiei+1 . . . en−1e1 . . . ei−2 form a red copy of C5
blue, then

n). If the edge g1 is

Qg1{u1, v4i−3, v4i−2, v4i−1, x}

is a blue copy of C5

m. Otherwise,

Qg2{v4i−3, v4i−2, v4i−1, u1, y}

is a copy of C5

m in Hblue.

V. |T | = 0.

One can easily check that ℓ′ = 2⌊ m−1
2 ⌋ + 2. Remove the last two edges of Q to get
two disjoint blue paths Q and Q′ so that kQ ∪ Q′k = 2⌊ m−1
2 ⌋ and (Q ∪ Q′) ∩ ((ei−3 \
{fP,ei−3}) ∪ ei−2 ∪ ei−1) = ∅. By an argument similar to the case |T | = 0 of Subcase
1 and the case |T | = 1 of this subcase, we can ﬁnd a blue copy of C5
m.

For every edge ei = {v4i−3, v4i−2, v4i−1, v4i, v4i+1}, 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, and ev-
Case 2.
ery vertices z1, z2 ∈ W and v′ ∈ ei+1 \ {lC,ei+1} (also v′ ∈ ei−1 \ {fC,ei−1}) the edge
{v4i−1, v4i, v′, z1, z2} (also the edge {v′, v4i−2, v4i−1, z1, z2}) is blue.

Let W = {u1, u2, . . . , u⌊ m−1

2 ⌋+4}. First assume that m = 7. Set

hi = 


(ei \ {v4i, v4i+1}) ∪ {ui, ui+1} for 1 ≤ i ≤ 6,

(ei \ {v4i, v4i+1}) ∪ {ui, u1}

for i = 7.

Since hi’s, 1 ≤ i ≤ 7, are blue, then h1h2 . . . h7 is a blue copy of C5
7 . Therefore, we may
assume that m ≥ 8. Let P = e1e2 . . . en−3 and W0 = W \ {u1}. Clearly |W0| ≥ 6. Since
there is no red copy of C5
n, P is a maximal path w.r.t. W0. Applying Corollary 2.5, there
are two disjoint blue paths Q and Q′ between P, the path obtained from P by deleting
the last r edges for some r ≥ 0 and W ′ ⊆ W0 with the mentioned properties. We can
without loss of generality assume that kQk ≥ kQ′k. By Corollary 2.5, since kPk = n − 3,

25

we have ℓ′ = 2

3 (n − 3 − r).

Subcase 1. kQ′k 6= 0.
Set T = W0 \ W ′. Let x, y and x′, y′ be the end vertices of Q and Q′ in W ′, respectively.
Using Corollary 2.5 we have one of the following cases:

I. |T | ≥ 3.

In this case we have ℓ′ ≤ 2⌊ m−1
occur by Corollary 2.5.

2 ⌋ − 4 and so r ≥ 4. Therefore, this case does not

II. |T | = 2.

In this case, ℓ′ =
We can without loss of generality assume that T = {u2, u3}.
2⌊ m−1
2 ⌋ − 2. If m is even, then ℓ′ = m − 4 and r ≥ 3. It is impossible by Corollary
2.5. So we may assume that m is odd. Therefore, ℓ′ = m − 3 and r ≥ 1. Based on
our assumptions, the edges h1, h2 and h3 are blue, where

h1 = (en−3 \ {v4(n−3)−3, v4(n−3)−2}) ∪ {y, x′},
h2 = (en−2 \ {v4(n−2)−3, v4(n−2)−2}) ∪ {y′, u2},
h3 = (en−1 \ {v4(n−1), v1}) ∪ {u3, x}.

Thereby Qh1Q′h2h3 is our desired blue C5
m.

III. |T | = 1.

By symmetry we may assume that T = {u2}. Clearly ℓ′ = 2⌊ m−1
2 ⌋. If m is odd,
then ℓ′ = m − 1. Remove the last two edges of Q ∪ Q′ to get two disjoint blue paths
Q and Q′ so that V (Q ∪ Q′) ∩ (en−4 ∪ en−3) = ∅. We can without loss of generality
assume that Q = Q. First let kQ′k > 0 and x′, y′′ with y′′ 6= y′ be the end vertices
of Q′ in W ′. It is easy to check that Qh1Q′h2h3 is a blue copy of C5

m, where

h1 = (en−3 \ {v4(n−3)−3, v4(n−3)−2}) ∪ {y, x′},
h2 = (en−2 \ {v4(n−2)−3, v4(n−2)−2}) ∪ {y′′, y′},
h3 = (en−1 \ {v4(n−1), v1}) ∪ {u2, x}.

So we may assume that kQ′k = 0. Clearly Qh′

1h′

2h′

3 is a blue copy of C5

m, where

h′
1 = (en−3 \ {v4(n−3)−3, v4(n−3)−2}) ∪ {y, x′},
h′
2 = (en−2 \ {v4(n−2)−3, v4(n−2)−2}) ∪ {x′, y′},
h′
3 = (en−1 \ {v4(n−1), v1}) ∪ {u2, x}.

Now let m be even. Therefore, ℓ′ = m − 2 and r ≥ 0. Let w be a vertex of en−3 \ en−4
so that w /∈ V (Q ∪ Q′) (the existence of w is guaranteed by Corollary 2.5). By
the assumption, the edges h = (en−2 \ {fC,en−2, v4(n−2), v4(n−2)+1}) ∪ {w, y, x′} and
h′ = (en−1 \ {v4(n−1), v1}) ∪ {y′, x} are blue and thereby QhQ′h′ is a blue copy of
C5
m.

26

Subcase 2. kQ′k = 0.
Let x and y be the end vertices of Q in W ′ and T = W0 \ W ′. Using Corollary 2.5 we
have the following cases:

I. |T | ≥ 4.

In this case, we have ℓ′ = 2⌊ m−1
Corollary 2.5.

2 ⌋ − 4 and r ≥ 4. So this subcase does not occur by

II. |T | = 3.

We suppose without loss of generality that T = {u2, u3, u4}. Clearly ℓ′ = 2⌊ m−1
First let m be odd. Then ℓ′ = m − 3 and r ≥ 1. Set

2 ⌋−2.

h1 = (en−2 \ {v4(n−2), v4(n−2)+1}) ∪ {y, u1},
h2 = (en−2 \ {v4(n−2)−3, v4(n−2)−2}) ∪ {u2, u3},
h3 = (en−1 \ {v4(n−1), v1}) ∪ {u4, x}.

Clearly Qh1h2h3 is a blue copy of C5
m.

Now, let m be even. Hence ℓ′ = m − 4 and r ≥ 3. It is easy to see that Qh′
is a blue copy of C5

m, where

1h′

2h′

3h′

h′
1 = (en−4 \ {v4(n−4), v4(n−4)+1}) ∪ {y, u1},
h′
2 = (en−3 \ {v4(n−3), v4(n−3)+1}) ∪ {u1, u2},
h′
3 = (en−2 \ {v4(n−2), v4(n−2)+1}) ∪ {u2, u3},
h′
4 = (en−1 \ {v4(n−1), v1}) ∪ {u3, x}.

III. |T | = 2.

By symmetry we may assume that T = {u2, u3}. Clearly ℓ′ = 2⌊ m−1
2 ⌋. If m is odd,
then ℓ′ = m − 1. Since the edge h = (en−1 \ {v4(n−1), v1}) ∪ {x, y} is blue, then Qh
is a blue copy of C5
m.
Now, we may assume that m is even. So ℓ′ = m − 2. Set

h = (en−1 \ {v4(n−1), v1}) ∪ {u2, x},
h′ = (en−2 \ {v4(n−2)−3, v4(n−2)−2}) ∪ {y, u3}.

Thereby, Qh′h is a copy of C5

m in Hblue.
