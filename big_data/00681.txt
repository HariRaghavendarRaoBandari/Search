Abstract

In this paper, by using bi-periodic Fibonacci numbers, we introduce
the bi-periodic Fibonacci octonions. After that, we derive the generating
function of these octonions as well as investigated some properties over
them. Also, as another main result of this paper, we give the summations
for bi-periodic Fibonacci octonions.

Keywords: Bi-periodic Fibonacci sequence, Fibonacci sequence, gen-

erating functions, octonions.

1 Introduction

There has been an increasing interest on quaternions and octonions that
play an important role in various areas such as computer sciences, physics, dif-
ferential geometry, quantum physics, signal, color image processing, geostatics
and analysis [1, 8].

Let O be the octonion algebra over the real number ﬁeld R. It is known, by

the Cayley-Dickson process that any p ∈ O can be written as

∗e mail: nzyilmaz@selcuk.edu.tr, yyazlik@nevsehir.edu.tr, ntaskara@selcuk.edu.tr

p = p

′ + p

′′

e ,

where p′, p′′ ∈ H =(cid:8)a0 + a1i + a2j + a3k(cid:12)(cid:12) i2 = j2 = k2 = −1, ijk = −1, a0, a1, a2, a3 ∈ R(cid:9)

the real quaternion division algebra. The octonions in Cliﬀord algebra C are a normed
division algebra with eight dimensions over the real numbers larger than the quater-
nions. The ﬁeld O ∼= C 4 of octonions

p =

Xs=0

pses, ps ∈ R,

is an eight-dimensional non-commutative and non-associative R-ﬁeld generated by
eight base elements

e0 = 1, e1 = i, e2 = j, e3 = k, e4 = e, e5 = ie, e6 = je, e7 = ke .

The addition and multiplication of any two octonions, p = p′ + p′′e, q = q′ + q′′e,

are deﬁned by

p + q = p′ + q′ + (p′′ + q′′)e and pq = p′q′ − q′′p′′ + (q′′p′ + p′′q′)e ,

where q′, q′′ denote the conjugates of the quaternions q′, q′′, respectively. The conju-
gate and norm of p are denoted by

p = Re(p) − Im(p) and pp =

p2
s ,

Xs=0

(1.1)

respectively [1, 8, 38, 42].

On the other hand, the literature includes many papers dealing with the special
number sequences such as Fibonacci, Lucas, Pell ([4, 9, 21, 25, 26, 30, 39, 40, 41]).
One of these directions goes through to the bi-perodic Fibonacci (or, equivalently, gen-
eralized Fibonacci ) and the bi-periodic Lucas (or, equivalently, generalized Lucas). In
fact bi-perodic Fibonacci sequences have been ﬁrstly deﬁned by Edson and Yayenie in
2009 and then some important properties for these sequences have been investigated in
the references [9, 39]. Also, bi-perodic Lucas sequences have been deﬁned by Bilgici in
2014 and then some important properties for these sequences have been investigated in
the reference [4]. For any two nonzero real numbers a and b, the bi-periodic Fibonacci
{qn}∞

n=0 and bi-periodic Lucas sequences {ln}∞

n=0 are deﬁned recursively by

and

bqn−1 + qn−2,

q0 = 0, q1 = 1, qn =(cid:26) aqn−1 + qn−2,
l0 = 2, l1 = a, ln =(cid:26) bln−1 + ln−2,

if n is even
if n is odd

n ≥ 2

(1.2)

if n is even
if n is odd

n ≥ 2 .

(1.3)

aln−1 + ln−2,

In addition, the authors in the references [4],[9] and [39] expressed so many prop-
erties on the bi-periodic Fibonacci and bi-periodic Lucas sequences.
In fact some
of the main outcomes (that depicted in these references) of these sequences can be
summarized as in the following:

• The Binet formulas are given by

qn =

a1−ξ(n)
(ab)⌊ n

2 ⌋ (cid:18) αn − βn
α − β (cid:19)

(1.4)

2

and

ln =

aξ(n)
(ab)⌊ n+1
2 ⌋

(αn + βn) ,

where the condition ξ (n) = n − 2(cid:4) n

2(cid:5) can be read as
ξ (n) =(cid:26) 0, n is even

1, n is odd

(1.5)

(1.6)

and α, β are roots of characteristic equation of λ2 − abλ − ab = 0.

• The generating functions for the bi-periodic Fibonacci and bi-periodic Lucas

sequences with odd subscripted are

f (x) =

∞

Xm=1

and

L1(x) =

Xm=0

q2m−1x2m−1

.

(1.7)

(1.8)

• The bi-perodic Fibonacci and bi-peridoic Lucas sequences satify the equations

and

(ab + 4)qn = ln−1 + ln+1 ,

ln = qn−1 + qn+1

q−n = (−1)n−1qn ,

l−n = (−1)nln .

(1.9)

(1.10)

(1.11)

(1.12)

After all these above material on bi-periodicity, let us give our attention to the
other classiﬁcation parameters on these above special sequences, namely quaternions
and octonions. We should note that, in the literature (see [2, 3, 5]-[7], [10]-[20],[22]-
[24],[27]-[29], [31]-[37] and the references cited in them), it can be found some works on
the quaternions and octonions for Jabosthal, Pell as well as the Fibonacci and Lucas
numbers. For example, in [24], it is investigated some properties of the Fibonacci and
Lucas octonions.

It is natural to wonder whether there exits a connection between the parameters
bi-periodicity and quaternions. Actually this was done in [35, 36]. The authors deﬁned
the bi-periodic Fibonacci and Lucas quaternions as

Qn =

3

Xs=0

qn+ses and Pn =

ln+ses ,

3

Xs=0

where n ≥ 0.

In the light of all these above material (depicted as separate paragraphs), the
main goal of this paper is to deﬁne bi-periodic Fibonacci octonions with a diﬀerent
viewpoint. To do that, by using bi-periodic Fibonacci numbers, we obtain the gen-
erating function of these octonions. We also actually investigated some properties of
bi-periodic Fibonacci octonions.

2 The bi-periodic Fibonacci octonions

As we indicated in the previous section, in this part, we introduce the bi-periodic
Fibonacci octonions as a new generalization of Fibonacci octonions by considering the
bi-periodic Fibonacci numbers.

Deﬁnition 2.1 The bi-periodic Fibonacci octonions On(a, b) are deﬁned by

On(a, b) =

qn+ses,

7

Xs=0

(2.1)

where qn is the bi-periodic Fibonacci number for n ∈ N = {0, 1, 2, 3, . . .}.

From the Equation (1.11), that is q−n = (−1)n−1qn, the bi-periodic Fibonacci

octonions with negative subscripts are deﬁned by

O−n(a, b) =

7

Xs=0

(−1)n−s−1qn−ses,

(2.2)

where n ∈ N = {0, 1, 2, 3, . . .}.

After all, we present the following ﬁrst proposition of this paper.

Proposition 2.1 For n ∈ N, we give the results related to bi-periodic Fibonacci octo-
nions:

i) On(a, b) + On(a, b) = 2qne0,
ii) O2

n(a, b) + On(a, b)On(a, b) = 2qne0On(a, b),

iii) On(a, b)On(a, b) =P7

iv) O−n(a, b) + O−n(a, b) = 2(−1)n−1qne0

s=0 q2

n+s

v) On(a, b) + O−n(a, b) = lnO0(a, b), where n is even.

Proof.

i) From Deﬁnition 2.1, we obtain

7

On(a, b) + On(a, b) =

qn+ses + qne0 −

Xs=0

= 2qne0 .

qn+ses

7

Xs=1

ii) By taking into account i), we have

O2

n(a, b) = On(a, b)(2qne0 − On(a, b))

= 2qne0On(a, b) − On(a, b)On(a, b) .

iii) The proof is easily seen by using the Equation (1.1).

iv) The proof is similar to i).

4

v) From the Equations (2.1) and (2.2), we write for n even

On(a, b) + O−n(a, b) =

=

qn+ses +

7

(−1)n−s−1qn−ses

Xs=0

(qn+s + (−1)s−1qn−s)es .

7

7

Xs=0
Xs=1

By taking into account the Equations (1.2) and (1.10), we obtain

7

On(a, b) + O−n(a, b) = ln

qses

Xs=1

= lnO0(a, b) .

Theorem 2.1 For n ≥ 0, the Binet formula for the bi-periodic Fibonacci octonions
is

On(a, b) =

Proof. It can easily seen by considering the Deﬁnition 2.1 and the Equation (1.4).

Theorem 2.2 For n, r ∈ Z+ and n ≥ r, the following equality is hold:

O2n−2r(a, b)O2n+2r(a, b) − O2

2n(a, b) =

α∗β ∗((ab)2r − α4r) + β ∗α∗((ab)2r − β4r)

(ab)2r(α − β)2

.

Proof. Let us take U = O2n−2r (a, b)O2n+2r(a, b) − O2
2.1, we write

2n(a, b). Then, by using Teorem

U =

If we take r = 1 in Theorem 2.2, it is obtained in the following corollary.

Corollary 2.1 For n ∈ Z+, we have the Cassini-like identity

O2n−2(a, b)O2n+2(a, b) − O2

2n(a, b) =

α∗β ∗((ab)2 − α4) + β ∗α∗((ab)2 − β4)

(ab)2(α − β)2

.

Theorem 2.3 For n, r ∈ Z+, n ≥ r and r is even, we have

On−r(a, b)On+r(a, b)−O2

n(a, b) =( α∗β ∗((ab)r

if n is odd

.

Proof. The proof is done similarly to the proof of Theorem 2.2.

Now, we present the generating function of the bi-periodic Fibonacci octonions in

the following theorem.

Theorem 2.4 For the bi-periodic Fibonacci octonions, we have the generating func-
tion

On(a, b)xn =

O0(a, b) + x(O1(a, b) − bO0(a, b)) + (a − b)R(x)

Proof. Assume that G(x, a, b) is the generating function for the bi-periodic Fibonacci
octonions. Then we have

G(x, a, b) = O0(a, b) + O1(a, b)x + O2(a, b)x2 + · · · + On(a, b)xn + · · · .

(2.3)

If it is multiplying equation (2.3) with bx and x2, respectively, then we have

bxG(x, a, b) = bO0(a, b)x + bO1(a, b)x2 + bO2(a, b)x3 + · · · + bOn(a, b)xn+1 + · · · . (2.4)

x2G(x, a, b) = O0(a, b)x2 + O1(a, b)x3 + O2(a, b)x4 + · · · + On(a, b)xn+2 + · · · . (2.5)
By considering the Equations (1.2), (2.3), (2.4), (2.5) and Deﬁnition 2.1, it is obtained
the equation

(1 − bx − x2)G(x) = O0(a, b) + x(O1(a, b) − bO0(a, b))

(On(a, b) − bOn−1(a, b) − On−2(a, b))xn

(qn+s − bqn+s−1 − qn+s−2)esxn .

6

By considering again the Equations (1.2) and (1.7), we get

(1 − bx − x2)G(x) = O0(a, b) + x(O1(a, b) − bO0(a, b)) + (a − b)

Consequently, we have

(1 − bx − x2)G(x) = O0(a, b) + x(O1(a, b) − bO0(a, b)) + (a − b)xf (x)e0
+(a − b)(f (x) − q1x)e1 + (a − b)x−1(f (x) − q1x)e2
+(a − b)x−2(f (x) − q1x − q3x3)e3
+(a − b)x−3(f (x) − q1x − q3x3)e4
+(a − b)x−4(f (x) − q1x − q3x3 − q5x5)e5
+(a − b)x−5(f (x) − q1x − q3x3 − q5x5)e6
+(a − b)x−6(f (x) − q1x − q3x3 − q5x5 − q7x7)e7
= O0(a, b) + x(O1(a, b) − bO0(a, b)) + (a − b)R(x)

as required.

For bi-periodic Fibonacci octonions, we give the summations according to speciﬁed

rules.

Theorem 2.5 For n ∈ Z+, there exist

On+1(a, b) + On(a, b) − On−1(a, b) − On−2(a, b)

similarly with it. The main point of the proof will be touched just the result Theorem
2.1(in other words the Binet formula of these octonions). We must note that the proof
should be investigated for both cases of n.

Corollary 2.2 In the all results of Section 2, to reveal the importance of this subject,
we can express certain and immediate relationships as follows:

• If we replace a = b = 1 in qn, we obtain the same result in [24] for Fibonacci

octonions.

• If we replace a = b = 2 in qn, we obtain the same result in [34] for Pell octonions.

• If we replace a = b = k in qn, we get the k-Fibonacci octonions.

Conclusion 2.1 In this paper, we deﬁne the octonions for bi-periodic Fibonacci se-
quences and present some properties of these octonions. By the results in Sections 2
of this paper, we have a great opportunity to compare and obtain some new properties
over these octonions. This is the main aim of this paper. Thus, we extend some recent
result in the literature.

In the future studies on the octonions for number sequences, we except that the

following topics will bring a new insight.

• It would be interesting to study the diﬀerent summations and properties for bi-

periodic Fibonacci octonions,

• Also, it would be interesting to investigate the octonions for bi-periodic general-

ized Fibonacci sequences.
