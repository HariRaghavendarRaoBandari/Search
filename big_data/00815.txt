ABSTRACT
We explore the formation of superbubbles through energy deposition by multiple supernovae
(SNe) in a uniform medium. We use total energy conserving, 3-D hydrodynamic simulations
to study how SNe correlated in space and time create superbubbles. While isolated SNe ﬁzzle
out completely by ∼ 1 Myr due to radiative losses, for a realistic cluster size it is likely that
subsequent SNe go oﬀ within the hot/dilute bubble and sustain the shock till the cluster life-
time. We scan the parameter space of ISM density (ng0), number of SNe (NOB), and star cluster
radius (rcl) to study the conditions for the formation of an overpressured (super)bubble. For
realistic cluster sizes, we ﬁnd that the bubble remains overpressured only if, for a given ng0,
NOB is suﬃciently large. While most of the input energy is still lost radiatively, superbubbles
can retain up to ∼ 5 − 10% of the input energy in form of kinetic+thermal energy till 10 Myr
for ISM density ng0 ≈ 1 cm−3. We ﬁnd that the mechanical eﬃciency decreases for higher
densities (ηmech ∝ n−2/3
). We compare the radii and velocities of simulated supershells with
observations and the classical adiabatic model. Our simulations show that the superbubbles
retain only . 10% of the injected energy, thereby explaining the observed smaller size and
slower expansion of supershells. We also conﬁrm that a suﬃciently large (& 104) number of
SNe is required to go oﬀ in order to create a steady wind with a stable termination shock
within the superbubble.

1 INTRODUCTION

HI holes, shells, rings, expanding cavities, galactic chimneys, and ﬁlaments
are ubiquitous structures which are embedded in the large scale gas distribu-
tion of a galaxy. Heiles (1979) identiﬁed large cavities in the local interstel-
lar medium (ISM) with energy requirement of & 3 ×1052 erg as supershells.
Our solar system is itself embedded in such a cavity (radius ∼ 100 pc) ﬁlled
with hot (∼ 106 K) and tenuous (n ∼ 5 × 10−3 cm−3) plasma (Sanders et al.
1977; McCammon et al. 1983) known as the local hot bubble (LHB).

When the size of a superbubble becomes comparable to the galactic HI
scale height, it may break out of the galactic disk if the shell is suﬃciently
fast (e.g., Mac Low & McCray 1988; Roy et al. 2013) and inject energy and
metals into the galactic halo. The widely accepted model of galaxy-scale
superwinds involves injection of mechanical energy by massive stars in the
form of radiation (L⋆), stellar winds (Lw) and supernova (SN) explosions
(ESN ∼ 1051 erg). Clearly, such large cavities cannot be created by either the
wind from a single massive star or by the supernova explosion of a single
star. Further it is known from observations of O-type stars in the Galaxy that
∼ 70% of them are associated with clusters and OB associations and a very

small fraction of the known O-stars are isolated (Chu & Gruendl 2008).
Out of the remaining 30%, more than one-third are runaway stars which
have been ejected in close gravitational encounters (Gies 1987). Hence the
most plausible mechanism for the formation of large superbubbles is quasi-
continuous energy injection from multiple stars. The expanding shells of
each individual star/SN merge to form a large scale bubble known as a su-
perbubble.

Pikel’Ner (1968); Avedisova (1972) studied the interaction of a strong
stellar wind with the interstellar medium (ISM). The circumstellar shell
enters the snowplow phase when the radiative cooling timescale for the
swept gas becomes equal to the dynamical age of the shell. Weaver et al.
(1977) calculated the detailed structure for interaction of a strong stellar
wind with the interstellar medium. Castor et al. (1975) obtained a solution
for the case of continuous energy injection (at a point) inside a homogen-
eous medium by a stellar wind (Lw = ˙M2
w/2) in the absence of radiative
energy losses and found the presence of a transition region dominated by
thermal conduction between the cold outer layer of the shell (shocked ISM)
and the hot inner layer of the shell (shocked stellar wind). Weaver et al.
(1977) analytically calculated detailed structure of the bubble in various
phases of evolution, including the eﬀects of radiative cooling. McCray &
Kafatos (1987) highlighted that the stellar initial mass function and stellar
ages are such that the impact of mechanical energy input from supernovae
(SNe) within a star cluster can be well modeled as a constant luminosity
driven superbubble.

Yadav, Mukherjee, Sharma, & Nath

Chevalier & Clegg (1985) obtained the steady wind solution driven by
a constant rate of mass and thermal energy injection within a small spherical
volume. Their solution is subsonic within the injection radius, and beyond
that reaches a constant supersonic speed. They applied their wind solution
to understand the observations of the galactic outﬂow in M82. Tomisaka
et al. (1981) performed 1D calculations in a medium with constant particle
density. In their calculations all explosions occur at the same point in space
sequentially inside the cavity created by previous SNe. Vasiliev et al. (2015)
have recently carried out 3-D simulations in which SNe are uniformly dis-
tributed throughout the simulation box. Sharma et al. (2014) (hereafter,
SRNS14) show that isolated supernova, in typical ISM conditions, lose al-
most all their mechanical energy by radiative losses by . 0.1 Myr, whereas
a sequence of explosions occurring inside the cavity blown by previous SNe
can retain up to ∼ 40% of the injected mechanical energy for few tens of
Myr (of order the galactic dynamical time ∼ 50 Myr).

Understanding the impact of massive stars, via their radiation, winds,
and SNe, on the ISM is essential for star and galaxy formation. Observed
star formation is ineﬃcient, both locally on molecular cloud scales (e.g.,
Krumholz & Tan 2007) and globally on galactic scales (e.g., Kauﬀmann
et al. 2003). Supersonic turbulence, magnetic ﬁelds, radiative, photoioniza-
tion and jet feedback from massive stars, etc. are invoked to explain the inef-
ﬁciency of star formation on molecular cloud scales (Krumholz et al. 2014
and references therein). Because of several complex processes involved,
there is no consensus on the relative contribution of these diﬀerent mech-
anisms acting on molecular cloud scales. The situation is slightly better on
galactic scales and feedback due to correlated SNe (in space and time) ap-
pears to explain feedback on galactic scales & 1 kpc (e.g., Strickland et al.
2004; de Avillez & Breitschwerdt 2005; Joung & Mac Low 2006; Creasey
et al. 2013; Hennebelle & Iﬀrig 2014; Li et al. 2015).

It is well recognized that isolated SNe suﬀer catastrophic cooling
losses in high density clouds in which they are born (e.g., Thornton et al.
1998). In this case, almost all of the injected energy is lost rather than coup-
ling to the ISM, especially over global dynamical timescales (∼ 10s of
Myr). Even when SNe coalesce before each of them suﬀer radiative losses
(i.e., if supernova rate density is high enough), they only retain ∼ 10% of
the injected energy (Sharma et al. 2012). Even such a small eﬃciency of
mechanical energy coupling to the ISM appears more than enough to signi-
ﬁcantly suppress star formation on global scales for Milky Way and lower
mass galaxies (e.g., Efstathiou 2000; red dot-dashed line in Fig. 4 of Sharma
et al. 2012).

Shocks generated by supersonic turbulence (expected within the dense
shell) enhance density perturbations and gravitational instability locally
(e.g., McCray & Kafatos 1987), but turbulence and magnetic ﬁelds in the
dense shell, in all likelihood, prevent eﬃcient global star formation (e.g.,
Stone & Norman 1992; Mac Low & Klessen 2004). Since turbulence can
only be faithfully captured in 3-D, it is necessary to study the ISM using
3-D simulations.

The problem of star-ISM interaction involves complex chemical, ion-
ization/recombination, thermal, and dynamical processes, and it is neces-
sary to begin with understanding the most important processes in some de-
tail. In this paper we ignore all these processes except for idealized dynam-
ical and thermal processes associated with SNe resulting from the death
of massive stars. We also ignore magnetic ﬁelds and thermal conduction,
which can greatly modify the structures with large temperature gradients
(e.g., Fig. 9 of SRNS14). We only consider the hot and warm phases of the
ISM by turning oﬀ cooling below 104 K, corresponding to the thermally
stable warm neutral medium of the ISM. We do not consider the denser
cold neutral phase because: (i) the stable cold phase exists globally only for
a large enough ISM pressure, and hence is unlikely to be present in substan-
tial amount in galaxies less massive than Milky Way (Wolﬁre et al. 1995);
(ii) our focus is on feedback at scales larger than molecular clouds, and we
assume that a good fraction of supernova energy is able to leak out (aided
by low density channels formed due to stellar winds and radiation) into the
more uniformly spread and geometrically thicker warm neutral disk. Thus,
this paper is a generalization of 1-D simulations of SRNS14, with a real-
istic spatial distribution of SNe in 3-D. Unlike that work, we also use a total
energy conserving code so that the value of mechanical eﬃciency is more
accurate.

In this paper we study the formation of superbubbles using ideal-
ized 3-D hydrodynamic numerical simulations of SNe exploding in an ini-
tially homogeneous, isotropic ISM. Ours are among the highest resolution
uniform-grid simulations of its kind. In section 2 we describe the physical
setup and numerical simulations. In section 3.1 we describe the key results
from our simulations. Section 4 discusses analytic estimates and implica-
tions of our work. In section 5 we conclude.

2 PHYSICAL SETUP

We choose an idealized physical setup of a uniform ISM at 104 K, corres-
ponding to the warm neutral medium (WNM) maintained in thermal bal-
ance by photoelectric/photoionization and cosmic ray heating (Wolﬁre et al.
1995). Thermal energy is injected by SNe going oﬀ at random locations in-
side a spherical ‘star cluster’ and plasma is allowed to cool due to free-free
and line emission till 104 K. The key aim is to study the dynamics and ther-
modynamics of SNe coalescing in the WNM, and to study the conditions
for the formation of overpressured superbubbles.

2.1 Simulation Setup

We solve the hydrodynamic equations for the evolution of density, velocity
and pressure in 3-D Cartesian coordinates using the static grid version of
the ﬁnite volume, conservative, Godunov Eulerian code PLUTO (Mignone
et al. 2007). The mass and energy injected due to SNe are added as source
terms. The grid spacing is taken to be uniform in x, y and z directions. We
numerically solve the following equations:

∂ρ

(3)

where symbols have their usual meanings, cs = (γp/ρ)1/2 is the sound
speed, ˙ρSN is the mass density source term, ˙eSN is the thermal energy source
term mimicking supernova feedback (see section. 2.2), ˙erad ≡ neniΛ[T ]
(ne is electron number density, ni is ion number density and Λ[T ] is the
temperature-dependent cooling function) is the rate of energy loss per unit
volume due to radiative cooling. We use the ideal gas equation

ρǫ =

p

(γ − 1)

(4)

with γ = 5/3 (ǫ is internal energy per unit mass).

PLUTO solves the system of conservation laws which can be written as

∂u
∂t

= −∇ · Π + S,

(5)

where u is a vector of conserved quantities, Π is the ﬂux tensor and S is
the source term. The system of equations is integrated using ﬁnite volume
methods. The temporal evolution of Eq. 5 is carried by explicit methods
and the time step is limited by the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL; Courant
et al. 1928) condition. The code implements time-dependent optically thin
cooling (˙erad in Eq. 3) and the source terms ( ˙ρSN in Eq. 1 and ˙eSN in Eq. 3)
via operator splitting. Our results are unaﬀected by boundary conditions be-
cause we ensure that our box-size is large enough such that the outer shock
is suﬃciently inside the computational domain. We use the HLLC Riemann
solver (Toro et al. 1994). The solution is advanced in time using a second
order Runge-Kutta (RK2) scheme and a total variation diminishing (TVD)
linear interpolation is used. The CFL number is set to 0.3 for numerical
stability. The computational domain is initialized with an interstellar me-
dium (ISM) of uniform density (ng0), with a mean molecular weight per
particle µ = 0.603 (mean molecular weight per electron µe = 1.156) and
solar metallicity at a temperature of 104 K.

We have used the cooling module of PLUTO with the solar metallicity
cooling table of Sutherland & Dopita 1993).The cooling function is set to

zero below 104 K. We do not include self-gravity, disk stratiﬁcation, mag-
netic ﬁelds, and any form of gas heating (except by thermal energy injection
due to SNe) in our simulations.

3 RESULTS

3.1 The ﬁducial Run

Supernovae to Superbubbles

We have two types of simulation setups:

• Full box: The full box simulations have a computational domain ex-
tending from −L to +L in all three directions. Outﬂow boundary condi-
tions are used at the boundary of the computational box (i.e., the planes
x = −L, +L, y = −L, +L and z = −L, +L).

• Octant: In octant simulations the simulation box extends from 0 to +L
along the three directions. We inject SNe in a spherical ‘star cluster’ centred
at the origin, and the outcomes are spherically symmetric in a statistical
sense. Therefore, these simulations are statistically equivalent to the full
box simulations, but are computationally less expensive by roughly a factor
of 8. These simulations are only carried out for a large number of SNe
(NOB > 103) because of a larger spatial stochasticity for small number
of SNe; for small NOB, an octant may have an eﬀective number of SNe
which is substantially diﬀerent from NOB/8. For precise mass and energy
budgeting, we account for the actual mass and energy dumped in by SNe in
all cases. Reﬂective boundary conditions are used at the faces intersecting
within the ‘star cluster’ (i.e., the planes x = 0, y = 0 and z = 0).

2.2 Supernova Energy Injection

In our setup, supernovae explode within a ‘star cluster,’ a spherical region
of radius rcl centred at the origin of the simulation box. Most young star
clusters are . 10 pc in size (e.g., see Larsen 1999) but we allow rcl to be
larger. A larger rcl crudely mimics a collection of star clusters that powers
global galactic outﬂows such as in M82 (O’Connell et al. 1995). The loca-
tions of SNe are chosen randomly, distributed uniformly within a sphere of
radius rcl, using the uniform random number generator ran2 (Press et al.
1986). Supernovae are injected uniformly in time, with the time separation
between successive SNe given by

δtSN =

τOB
NOB

,

(6)

where τOB (chosen to be 30 Myr) is the life time of the OB association and
NOB is the total number of SNe (which equals the total number of O and B
stars).

Each SN deposits a mass of MSN = 5 M⊙ and internal energy of
ESN = 1051 erg over a sphere of size rSN = 5 pc; the SN energy injection
radius is chosen to prevent artiﬁcial cooling losses (see Eq. 7 in SRNS14,
corresponding to their thermal explosion model). SRNS14 found that the
late time (after a SN enters the Sedov-Taylor stage) results are independent
of whether SN energy is deposited as kinetic or thermal energy (see their
Figs. 2 & 3), so we simply deposit thermal energy.

Mass and energy injection from each SN is spread in space and time
using a Gaussian kernel, such that the mass and internal energy source terms
( ˙ρSN in Eq. 1 and ˙eSN in Eq. 3) are proportional to exp(−[t − ti]2/δt2
inj) ×
exp(−[x − xi]2/r2
SN), where ith SN is centred at ti in time and at xi in space.
The injection timescale is chosen to be δtinj = δtSN/10. SN injection with
smoothing is found to be numerically more robust and the results are insens-
itive to the details of smoothing. In addition to thermal energy, we deposit a
subdominant amount of kinetic energy because the mass that we add in each
grid cell (Eq. 1) is added at the local velocity. We account for this additional
energy in our energy budget.

We have carried out simulations with diﬀerent values of initial ambi-
ent density (ng0), cluster size (rcl) and number of supernovae (NOB). The
physical size of the simulation box is chosen according to the number of
SNe and the ambient density (based on the adiabatic bubble formula of Mc-
Cray & Kafatos 1987, the outer shock radius rsb ∝ [NOBt3/ng0]1/5). All our
3-D simulations are listed in Table B1 (convergence runs for the ﬁducial
parameters, NOB = 100, ng0 = 1 cm−3, rcl = 100 pc) and Table 1 (all other
runs).

MNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)

In this section we describe in detail the morphology and evolution of a su-
perbubble for number of SNe NOB = 100, initial gas density ng0 = 1 cm−3,
and cluster radius rcl = 100 pc, which we choose as our ﬁducial run. The
assumed parameters are typical of supershells (e.g., Heiles 1979; Suad et al.
2014; Bagetakos et al. 2011), but as mentioned earlier, rcl is larger than typ-
ical cluster sizes. Our spatial resolution is δL = 2.54 pc (run R2.5 in Table
B1). Simulations with diﬀerent NOB and ng0 evolve in a qualitatively similar
fashion, the diﬀerences being highlighted in section 3.3. Numerical resolu-
tion quantitively aﬀects our results, although the qualitative trends remain
similar. Strict convergence is not expected because thermal and viscous dif-
fusion are required to resolve the turbulent boundary layers connecting hot
and warm phases (e.g., Koyama & Inutsuka 2004). A detailed convergence
study is presented in Appendix B.

Fig. 1 shows the gas density and pressure slices in the midplane of the
simulation domain at times when SNe are eﬀectively isolated (1.27 Myr)
and when they have coalesced (9.55 Myr) to form an overpressured super-
bubble. Since the evolution of a single SN is well known (see, e.g., Figs. 1
& 2 in Kim & Ostriker 2015), in order to compare with superbubble evol-
ution we just brieﬂy review the diﬀerent phases of SN evolution. A SN
shock starts in the free-expansion phase, moving ballistically till the ejecta
sweeps up its own mass in the ISM. The next phase is the well-known adia-
batic Sedov-Taylor phase, which transitions to a radiative snowplow phase
with a thin radiative shell. The bubble loses pressure adiabatically after this,
and pressure inside the bubble falls below the ambient value by ∼0.5 Myr,
and the bubble stops expanding. In this state the shock slows down to the
sound speed in the ambient medium and becomes a sound wave. The SN
ﬁzzles out by ∼ 1 Myr. The maximum SN bubble size is . 50 pc.

Various stages of a single SN evolution can be seen in the top panels
of Fig. 1, which show four isolated SNe that have exploded by 1.27 Myr.
The top-left SN (see the projected locations of SNe in the top-left panel)
is the oldest, followed by the bottom left one; both have faded away, as
can be seen from a relatively high density and low pressure in the bubble
region. The other two SNe are younger. The bottom two panels of Fig. 1
show a fully developed superbubble; it is impossible to make out individual
SN remnants. Since most stars form in clusters, individual SN remnants are
an exception rather than a norm (e.g., see Wang 2014). Most superbubble
volume is overpressured (albeit slightly) relative to the ISM. Thus, super-
bubbles as a manifestation of overlapping SNe are qualitatively diﬀerent
from isolated SNe.

3.1.1 Global mass and energy budget

A key advantage of using a total energy conserving code like PLUTO is that
energy is conserved to a very high accuracy and we can faithfully calculate
the (typically small) mechanical eﬃciency of superbubbles. Fig. 2 demon-
strates that our mass injection (mimicking SNe) adds 100MSN by 30 Myr,
the intended amount. The energy added is higher by ≈ 30% because, as
mentioned earlier, the mass added by the density source term (Eq. 1) is ad-
ded at the local velocity, and hence mass addition leads to the addition of
kinetic energy.

Fig. 3 shows thermal, kinetic, and total energy eﬃciency as a function
of time for the ﬁducial run. Energy eﬃciency is deﬁned as the ratio of ex-
cess energy (current minus initial) in the simulation domain and the total
energy injected by SNe. The energy eﬃciency that is higher at early times,
decreases and asymptotes to a small value. Due to eﬃcient cooling, most
(≈ 95% by 30 Myr) of the deposited energy is lost radiatively. Out of the
remaining 5, ≈ 4% is retained as the thermal energy and 1% is retained as
the kinetic energy of the gas. In terms of the energy deposited by a single
supernova, the total (kinetic+thermal) energy retained is ≈ 6 ESN.

Figure 1. Gas density (left panels; log10 ng[cm−3]) and pressure (right panels) snapshots in the z = 0 plane from our ﬁducial run shown before (top panels) and
after (bottom panels) SNe coalesce. The yellow dots mark the projected location of SNe in the z = 0 plane, with four SNe having exploded by 1.27 Myr and
31 by 9.55 Myr. Top panels show that the SNe at 1.27 Myr are eﬀectively isolated and even at this short time (say, compared to a galaxy’s dynamical time) the
pressure within their individual bubbles is smaller than the ISM pressure. The bottom panels show the formation of a superbubble due to the overlap of several
SNe. The pressure inside most of the bubble volume, except at the center, is larger than the ISM value. Note that a SN has gone oﬀ just before 9.55 Myr, and
it creates a high pressure sphere right at the center. Also note that while the density scale is logarithmic, the pressure scale is linear.

with respect to the ISM for a similar duration. The strength of the bubble
pressure compared to that of the ambient medium is a good indicator of its
strength. As pressure decreases with the expansion of the bubble, it will no
longer be able to sustain a strong forward shock and will eventually degen-
erate into a sound wave.

Fig. 4 shows the volume distribution of pressure at all times for the
ﬁducial run. At t = 0 all the gas is at the ambient ISM pressure (indic-
ated by the vertical red line at 1.38 × 10−12 dyne cm−2). Because of a very

short-lived high pressure (Sedov-Taylor) phase and a small volume occu-
pied by the very overpressured gas, the volume fraction of gas with pres-
sure & 5 × 10−12 is small at all times. Before few Myr there is no coherent
(in time) structure in the pressure distribution. After overlap of SNe and the
formation of a superbubble, there is a coherent high pressure peak (shown
by the solid line marked by small circles) in the volume distribution that de-
creases with time. Bubble pressure decreases because of radiative and adia-
batic losses. As the input energy is spread over a larger and larger volume

energy are normalized (5 M⊙ for mass and 1051 erg for energy) such that
every SN adds 1 unit. Total energy injected is larger than just the thermal
energy put in due to SNe by ≈ 30% because kinetic energy is injected in
addition to the dominant thermal energy. The insets at top left and bottom
right show a zoom-in of injected energy and mass, respectively. One can
clearly see a unit step in the injected mass and energy for each SN that goes
oﬀ.

the bubble pressure decreases and eventually (much later than for an isol-
ated supernova) becomes comparable to the ambient pressure. At this stage
the shell propagates as a sound wave.

Fig. 5 shows the evolution of gas in the pressure-density plane. The
white plus (+) at ng/ng0, pg/p0 = 1 marks the location of the ambient ISM.
At early times SNe are isolated as evident from the multiple bright areas
(marked with white ‘x’) in the p − ng distribution at t = 1.27 Myr. Signiﬁc-
ant volume is occupied by gas at the ambient temperature (104 K), which
represents dense/isothermal radiative shells of isolated SNe at early times
and weak outer shock at later times. As the entire cluster volume is ﬁlled
with hot gas, it forms an extended hot bubble, and the p − ng plane shows a
bimodal volume distribution in which the shell/ISM gas is on right and the
hot (∼ 108 K) and rariﬁed gas in the bubble is on left. As the superbubble
ages, the hot (∼ 108 K) and warm (∼ 104 K) phases reach rough pressure
equilibrium (most of the superbubble volume is still slightly overpressured;
see Fig. 4). However, the bubble gas density, even at late times, is ∼ 4 orders
of magnitude smaller relative to the ambient ISM value. In some snapshots
(bottom three panels) we see a straight line with slope equal to γ = 5/3
stretching from low density/pressure to the peak in the hot gas distribution.
These streaks represent adiabatic hot winds launched by continuous (for a
short time δtinj) SN energy injection (see section 2.2) inside the dilute hot
bubble (see the very low density/pressure sphere at the center in the bottom
panels of Fig. 1). The curved streak at low pressure/density is due to smaller
energy injection at the beginning (and end) of SN energy injection (recall
that energy injection follows Gaussian smoothing in time; see section 2.2).
These streaks are an artifact of our smooth SN energy injection.

the simulation the gas retains a small fraction, ≈ 1% and ≈ 5% of the total

3.1.3 1-D proﬁles & overpressure-fraction

The radius evolution of a single SN remnant inside a uniform medium
is well known. The radius expands diﬀerently with time in each of the
free-expansion, Sedov-Taylor, pressure-driven snowplow and momentum-
conserving phases (e.g., Cox 1972). The radius evolution of a superbubble
is qualitatively diﬀerent from the radius evolution of a single SN because
of the continuous injection of mechanical energy till the lifetime of the OB
association (e.g., SRNS14). A large bubble pressure is maintained until the
energy (only a small fraction of it is retained due to radiative losses) is
spread over a large volume.

The superbubble radius (rsb) and velocity (sb = drsb/dt) evolves with

time as (Eq. 5 of Weaver et al. 1977)

where V = 8L3 is the volume of the simulation box; ˜p = p/p0; bin-size
in pressure ∆ ˜p = 0.007) of diﬀerent pressures at all times. The vertical
red line at unity corresponds to the large volume occupied by the ambient
unperturbed ISM. The circles connected by a solid line mark the location
of the local pressure maximum on the higher side. Before 5 Myr a coher-
ent overlap of isolated SNe has not happened and a distinct structure in the
pressure distribution does not appear.

where c0,1 is the sound speed in the ambient medium in units of 10 km s−1.
Fig. 6 shows density, pressure and x− velocity proﬁles along the x−
axis for the ﬁducial run at the same times as the panels in Fig. 5. The evolu-
tion of various proﬁles is as expected. The shell become weaker and slower
with time and eventually propagates at roughly the sound speed of the am-
bient medium (c0). Time evolution of the angle-averaged (unlike Fig. 6,
which shows a cut along x− axis) inner and outer shell radii (see Appendix
A) is shown in Fig. 7.

The radius and velocity evolution of bubbles is critically dependent
on the presence of radiative losses (encapsulated by ηmech; Weaver et al.
1977). In order to assess the strength of a superbubble, it is useful to deﬁne
an overpressure volume fraction (ηO) as
V>

(11)

ηO =

,

V> + V<

where V> is the volume occupied by gas at pressure p > 1.5p0 and V< is the
volume occupied by gas at p < p0/1.5 (p0 is the ambient ISM pressure; the
choice of 1.5 is somewhat arbitrary). Thus ηO gives the fraction of volume
occupied by high pressure, hot and dilute bubble gas. Since we exclude gas
close to the ambient ISM pressure in its deﬁnition, ηO is independent of
the computational domain and characterizes the bubble pressure. In Fig. 7
we also show the evolution of the hot volume fraction (ηO) as a function of
time for the ﬁducial run. The hot volume fraction drops initially when SNe
have not overlapped, but reaches unity after ≈ 3 Myr, and starts decreasing
rapidly after radiative losses become signiﬁcant and the bubble pressure
become comparable to the ISM pressure (or equivalently, the shock velocity
becomes comparable to the ISM sound speed). The nature of the hot volume
fraction evolution is discussed in more detail in sections 3.3.2 and 4.1.

3.2 Comparison with 1-D simulations

Most of supernova and superbubble studies are carried out in spherical 1-
D geometry because these systems are spherical (although only crudely)
and very high resolution runs can be done. We want to compare our more
realistic 3-D simulations (albeit with much lower resolution compared to
the modern 1-D simulations) with 1-D runs to highlight the similarities and
diﬀerences between the two.

For a realistic comparison of 1-D spherical and 3-D Cartesian runs,
in the simulations highlighted in this section we explode all SNe at the
origin (i.e., rcl = 0). Both the 1-D and 3-D runs have the same resolution
as the ﬁducial run (δL = δr=2.54 pc; the only diﬀerence between this 3-D
simulation and the ﬁducial run is that here rcl = 0). As discussed in section
3.1.1, the amount of total mechanical energy injected in the box is slightly
larger than NOB × ESN because of extra kinetic energy that we put in due to
mass addition at the local velocity. For an exact comparison of our 1-D and
3-D runs we match the total energy injected in our 1-D and 3-D runs (by
slightly scaling ESN for the 1-D run).

Three panels of Fig. 8 (except the bottom-right one) compare the time
evolution of 1-D and 3-D simulations. The top two panels show that the
total radiative losses are slightly higher (by ≈ 3%) for the 1-D spherical
run (correspondingly, mechanical energy in the box is slightly smaller), and
they are similar for the 3-D Cartesian simulations with rcl = 0 and rcl =
100 pc. The overpressure fraction (ηO) evolution is also very similar for
the spherical 1-D and the 3-D simulation with rcl = 0. The wild spikes
at late times show that the bubble pressure is close to the ISM value and
jumps above 1.5p0 after every SN exploding inside the bubble. The outer
(inner) shell radius for the 3-D simulation (with rcl = 0) is only slightly
larger (smaller) than the 1-D run. To conclude, 1-D spherical simulations
capture the correct evolution of global (or volume-averaged) quantities such
as mechanical eﬃciency.

The bottom right panel of Fig. 8 shows the radial distribution of
emissivity for the three runs. For 3-D runs, average pressure and dens-
ity are obtained by averaging over radial shells of size δL and emissivity
(neniΛ[T ]) is calculated. The almost discontinuous rise in emissivity cor-
responds to the contact discontinuity between the shocked SN ejecta and the
shocked ISM. While the 1-D emissivity proﬁle is very sharp, the transition
for 3-D runs (particularly with rcl = 100 pc) is smoother. This smoothing
is due to deviation from sphericity, in particular the crinkling of the contact
surface seen in the bottom panels of Fig. 1. This also makes the shell in
Cartesian simulations slightly thicker compared to the spherical 1-D run.
Radiative losses for 3-D runs are spread almost throughout the shell but are
conﬁned to the outer radiative relaxation layer in the spherical run (see Fig.
5 in SRNS14).

3.3 Eﬀects of cluster & ISM properties

After discussing the ﬁducial run in detail, in this section we study the inﬂu-
ence of cluster and ISM parameters (cluster radius rcl, number of OB stars
NOB, and ISM density ng0).

3.3.1 Eﬀects of ISM density

The gas density in which SNe explode is a crucial parameter that determines
their subsequent evolution, both in adiabatic (rsb ∝ ρ−1/5) and radiative
(radiative losses are higher for a larger density) regimes. The left panel of
Fig. 9 shows that the overpressure fraction at early times (< 5 Myr) both
falls and rises slowly for a higher density ISM. The overlap of SNe at higher
densities takes longer because the individual bubble radius is smaller for a
higher density and one needs to wait longer to ﬁll the whole cluster with
hot gas. At late times, the overpressure fraction drops earlier for higher
densities because of larger radiative losses (although the bubble pressure
scales as n3/5

g0 according to Weaver et al. 1977 adiabatic scaling).

The right panel of Fig. 9 shows that the bubble expands more rap-
idly in the lower density medium. It also shows that although the shell in a
higher density ISM expands slowly, it sweeps up more mass. An adiabatic-
ally expanding strong bubble in a uniform medium is expected to sweep up

∆ log10 ˜p = 0.01) for the ﬁducial run at diﬀerent times. At late times there are two peaks in the distribution function corresponding to the WNM (ambient ISM
at 104 K) and the hot bubble (at ∼ 106 − 108 K). At 1.27 Myr we can see the signatures of non-overlapping SNe ﬁzzling out. Later, after about 5 Myr, we see
the formation of a low density and (slightly) over pressured superbubble. At some times we see streaks with p ∝ n5/3
, representing adiabatic cooling of recent
SNe ejecta expanding in the low density cavity. The white line shows a temperature of 104 K, ‘+’ represents the ambient pressure and density, and ‘x’s at 1.27
Myr represent bubbles corresponding to individual SNe (the bottom-right SN in the top-left panel of Fig. 1 is very young and not clearly seen).

ng0 = 0.5, 0.8 cm−3 shown in Fig. 9 is expected to be (0.5/0.8)2/5 ≈ 0.8,
whereas the actual value is ≈ 0.9. This is because the bubble expanding
in a denser ISM is slower than the adiabatic model due to radiative losses;
moreover, shells in a higher density medium suﬀer larger radiative losses.
The shell for the highest density run (ng0 = 2 cm−3) sweeps up an increas-
ingly larger mass at later times because RO ∝ c0t at late times, when the
shell moves close to the ISM sound speed.

3.3.2 Eﬀects of cluster radius

The key diﬀerence of this work from SRNS14 is that we are doing 3-D
simulations, which are necessary to study a realistic spatial distribution of
SNe. In 1-D spherical setup all SNe can only explode at the origin because
of spherical symmetry. Fig. 10 shows the evolution of overpressure volume
fraction (ηO) as a function of time for simulations with NOB = 104, ng0 = 10
cm−3, and diﬀerent star cluster radii.1 The plot has a characteristic shape

1 Here we choose parameters (NOB, ng0) diﬀerent from the ﬁducial run because the diﬀerent
stages of evolution are nicely separated in time for this choice.The temporal behavior is expected to
be qualitatively similar for diﬀerent choice of parameters.

MNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)

We can estimate the time when SNe start

with an initial fall, a rise and saturation, and an eventual fall. The initial
fall occurs as isolated SNe, without overlapping, ﬁzzle out due to radiative
losses (the top panels of Fig. 1 show density and pressure in this stage). The
rise happens as SNe overlap and form a superbubble. Eventually, the over-
pressure volume fraction drops as the volume of the superbubble becomes
too large and the outer shock weakens due to adiabatic and radiative losses.

ing that SNe overlap only after they have become radiative. In this case, by
a similar argument as that of the last paragraph, the overlap time to,rad is

large, overlap of supernovae is likely to occur. In this state the time for a
superbubble to ﬁzzle out is independent of the cluster size.

3.3.3 Eﬀects of supernova rate: formation of a steady wind

Chevalier & Clegg 1985 found a solution (hereafter CC85) for the wind
driven by internal energy and mass deposited uniformly within an injection
radius (r < R). This was applied to the galactic outﬂow in M82. For a large
number of SNe (i.e., a large NOB), the mechanical energy injection can be
approximated as a constant luminosity wind, Lw = NOBESN/τOB. Accord-
ing to CC85, within the injection radius (r . R) the mass density is constant,
whereas at large radii (wind region, r & R) density is expected to be ∝ r−2.
A termination shock is expected at the radius where the wind ram pressure
balances the pressure inside the shocked ISM. For small NOB, however, the
individual SN ejecta does not thermalize within the termination shock ra-
dius (rTS) as the SN occurs inside a low density bubble (the bubble density
is low in the absence of signiﬁcant mass loading as most of the ambient gas
is swept up in the outer shell) created by the previous SNe. For a large SN
rate the solution should approach the steady state described by Chevalier &
Clegg 1985. SRNS14 derived analytic constraints on NOB required for the
existence of a smooth CC85 wind inside the superbubble (see their Eq. 11)

Figure 7. The inner (green line) and outer (red line) radius of the super-
bubble shell as a function of time for the ﬁducial run. The blue line shows
the overpressure fraction (ηO) as a function of time. The superbubble starts
to ﬁzzle out when the overpressure fraction starts falling from ≈ 1, which
happens around 15 Myr. The average outer shell velocity is comparable to
the ISM sound speed; the inner shell speed is smaller. The bottom panel of
Fig. 6 shows that at late times the shell material moves at ≈ c0/2, similar
to the inner shell speed. The outer shell velocity is higher, ≈ c0, consistent
with the shell density decreasing in time.

CC85 model has two parameters: the eﬃciency with which star formation
is converted into thermal energy (α ≡ ˙E/SFR), and the mass loading factor
(β ≡ ˙M/SFR), which determine the properties of galactic outﬂows (e.g.,
Sarkar et al. 2016). From our setup we can determine the mass-loading for
large NOB simulations by calculating the mass loss rate from the cluster
measured at radii where the mass outﬂow rate ˙M(r) ≡ 4πr2ρ is roughly
constant. The mass loading factor for our NOB = 105 run is ≈ 1 as most of
the SN injected mass ﬂows out in a roughly steady wind. For much larger
NOB (or equivalently, SFR) valid for starbursts, the mass loading factor can
be reduced because of radiative cooling and mass drop-out from the dense
ejecta of SNe. This will be investigated in future.

4 DISCUSSION

In this section we discuss the astrophysical implications of our work, fo-
cusing on radiative losses, comparison the observed HI supershells, and gas
expulsion from star clusters.

4.1 Mechanical eﬃciency & critical supernova rate for

forming a superbubble

While isolated SNe lose all their energy by ∼ 1 Myr, even overlapping
SNe forming superbubbles lose majority of energy injected by SNe. The
mechanical eﬃciency of superbubbles is deﬁned as

ηmech ≡

(KE + ∆T E)

Einj

,

(17)

where KE is the total kinetic energy of the box, ∆T E is the increase in
the box thermal energy, and Einj is the energy injected by SNe (which is
slightly larger than NOBESN because mass is added at the local velocity).
By energy conservation (the computational box is large enough that energy

Figure 6. Gas density, pressure and x− velocity proﬁles along the x−axis
(y = z = 0) for the ﬁducial run at various times. The swept-up shell density
decreases with time as the superbubble weakens and eventually the shell
propagates at the sound speed in the ambient medium (c0 ≈ 15 km s−1). As
seen in Fig. 1, the bubble density is ∼ 4 orders of magnitude smaller than
the ambient value. The main bubble pressure decreases with time, except
during SN injection, during which a high pressure core and an adiabatic
wind with large velocity and small pressure (similar to Chevalier & Clegg
1985) forms (the streaks seen in some panels of Fig. 5 are also a signature
of this). The inset in the lowest panel shows that the dense shell propagates
at about half the sound speed in the ambient ISM, but the velocities in the
low density bubble are much higher.

for a smooth CC85 wind to appear by 1 Myr. Using the standard stellar mass
function, this corresponds to a star formation rate of ∼ 0.01M⊙yr−1. This
is a lower limit because thermalization just before the termination shock
does not lead to a high density/emissivity core, the characteristic feature of
a CC85 wind .

Fig 11 shows the density proﬁles for a range of NOB (NOB = 105 cor-
responds to a SN rate of ∼ 0.003 yr−1). As expected from thermalization
of a SN within the ejecta of all previous SNe (Eq. 16), a smooth CC85-
type wind with density ∝ r−2 at 30 Myr only forms for NOB & 104. Since
SNe form in OB associations, they are expected to overlap and form super-
bubbles. For a suﬃciently large number of SNe (& 105; e.g., in the super
star clusters powering a galactic wind in M82) a strong termination shock
(with Mach number ≫ 1) exists till late times, which may accelerate ma-
jority of Galactic and extragalactic high energy cosmic rays (e.g., Parizot
et al. 2004). In contrast, strong shocks (especially the reverse shock; McKee
1974) in isolated SNe exist only at early times (. 103 yr), after which the
reverse shock crushes the central neutron star and the outer shock weakens
with time (in fact catastrophically after it becomes radiative).

Fig. 12 shows the 2-D density snapshots of the 3-D runs shown in
Fig. 11, albeit at an earlier time. As expected, the shell is much thinner for a
larger number of SNe. Also, a dense injection region and a clear termination
shock are visible for the runs with NOB & 104. Crinkling of the contact
discontinuity and the thin shell is the key diﬀerence of 3-D runs as compared
to the spherical 1-D simulations.

The SNe driven wind is able to maintain a strong non-radiative termin-
ation shock that is able to power the outward motion of the outer shock. The

mulative radiative losses. Fig. 13 shows the mechanical eﬃciency (Eq. 17)
as a function of the initial gas density (ng0) at various times for runs with
diﬀerent NOB. One immediately sees that mechanical eﬃciency decreases
with an increasing ISM density (ng0). Eﬃciency also decreases with time
(by almost a factor of 10 from 5 to 30 Myr), especially for higher densities.
The maximum eﬃciency is ∼ 20%, occurring at early times. Our simula-
tions show that the mechanical eﬃciency of 3-D and 1-D simulations are
comparable and almost independent of the cluster size (rcl, see section 3.2

& Fig. 8), provided that SNe overlap before ﬁzzling out. A rough scaling of
ηmech ∝ n−2/3
, valid at most times, can be deduced from Fig. 13. Also note
that the mechanical eﬃciency increases very slightly for a larger number of
SNe.

Fig. 13 shows mechanical eﬃciencies that are about an order of mag-
nitude smaller than the values quoted in SRNS14. For example, the eﬃ-
ciency (which equals 1− fractional radiative losses; see the right panel of
Fig. 8 in SRNS14) for NOB = 105 and ng0 = 1 cm−3 in SRNS14 at 30 Myr
is ≈ 40%. The value for the same choice of parameters from Fig. 13 is ≈ 6%,

Figure 10. The evolution of overpressure fraction as a function of time for
ng0 = 10 cm−3 and NOB = 104, but with diﬀerent star-cluster sizes (rcl). The
overpressure fraction plummets initially as SNe are eﬀectively isolated and
cool catastrophically within 1 Myr. After that, as more SNe go oﬀ, they start
to overlap and create an overpressured bubble. As expected, the transition
to overlap happens later for a larger star-cluster. The late time drop in over-
pressure fraction, occurring due to adiabatic and radiative losses, is similar
for diﬀerent rcl. This suggests that the superbubble evolution is independent
of the cluster size, once the coherent overlap of SNe occurs.

MNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)

smaller by a factor of ≈ 7. This quantitative diﬀerence is a consequence of
the non-conservative nature of the ZEUS code used in SRNS14. Since in this
work we have used a conservative code and thoroughly investigated energy
conservation (see Fig. 2), our values should be considered more reliable.

Fig. 10 shows that the overpressure volume fraction ηO for ng0 = 10
cm−3 and NOB = 104 has a similar value for cluster sizes as large as rcl =
300 pc. This means that the evolution of the superbubble is independent
of rcl, as long as overlap of SNe happens before the cluster age, which is
very likely not only for individual star clusters but also for clusters of star
clusters as in the center of M82 galaxy (O’Connell et al. 1995). Therefore,
the key parameter that determines if the superbubble remains suﬃciently
overpressured by the end of the star-cluster lifetime, for a given gas density,
is the number of SNe NOB (and not the cluster size rcl).

The overpressure volume fraction (deﬁned in Eq. 11) is an appropriate
diagnostic to determine if a superbubble has ﬁzzled out or not. As described
earlier, we consider a superbubble ﬁzzled out if the average overpressure
fraction falls below 0.5 at late times (25 to 30 Myr). Fig. 14 shows the plot of
critical number of SNe required to produce an average overpressure volume
fraction of 0.5 at late times (25 to 30 Myr), for a given gas density. We
vary the ISM density for a given NOB, such that the late-time overpressure
fraction is close to 0.5. The critical NOB roughly scales as n2
g0.

Now we turn to analytic arguments to understand the scaling of critical
NOB for a given ISM density (ng0). The superbubble pressure as a function
of time, according to the adiabatic model of Weaver et al. (1977), is ∼ 3

This estimate of the critical number of OB stars to maintain an overpres-

ng0 = 10 cm−3 is about 104. From Eq. 19, we get the scaling of critical NOB
as NOB,crit ∝ ng0η−1

Figure 12. Density slices at t = 9.55 Myr in the x − y (z = 0) plane for
runs with diﬀerent NOB but with the same ISM density and cluster radius
(ng0 = 1 cm−3 and rcl = 100 pc). The shell becomes progressively thinner
with increasing NOB because a stronger shock causes higher compression.
Like Fig. 11, the axes are scaled with respect to the analytic scaling. The

density injection region are visible in the bottom two panels.

but comparable in magnitude (this depends on the assumed scale height and
disk radius). In the case of starbursts, the normalization for the KS relation
can be larger (Kennicutt & Evans 2012), but this normalization is also con-
sistent with the critical curve in this paper. Also note that the critical number
of OB stars (Eq. 20) depends sensitively on the ISM temperature and can
be much smaller for a cooler (say 100 K) disk. Therefore, a comparison of
Eqs. 20 & 22 should be made only after using appropriate disk/ISM para-
meters. A steeper slope for critical NOB as compared to the KS relation
(despite the dependence on other parameters as disk radius and ISM tem-
perature) implies that SNe can disrupt the star-forming regions more easily
in weak/moderate star-forming regions but not in dense starbursts. This may
explain the observed higher eﬃciency of star-formation (or a larger normal-
ization of KS relation; Eq. 21) in starbursts relative to moderate star forming
regions. The key uncertain step in this argument (which is beyond the scope
of this paper) is how the maintenance of an overpressured bubble translates
into suppression of star formation.

We can also compare our critical NOB − ng0 curve with the observed
threshold of SFR ∼ 0.1 M⊙ yr−1 kpc−2 for galactic superwinds (e.g., Heck-
man 2002). Using similar arguments used to derive Eq. 22, the critical SFR
density corresponding to our critical curve is

ΣSFR,crit ∼ 2 × 10−4M⊙yr−1kpc−2n1.89

g0 R−2

d,kpc.

(23)

While this is much smaller than the Heckman limit, it is comparable to the
lower limit on SFR density for the appearance of radio halos in spiral disks,
∼ 10−4 erg cm−2s−1 (equivalent to SFR density of 10−5M⊙yr−1kpc−2; Dah-
lem et al. 1995). Roy et al. (2013) argue that to form a galactic superwind
the superbubble has to break out with a suﬃciently high Mach number
(& 5), but our critical curve (Eq. 19) is based on a Mach number of unity.

resolution as the 3-D run) is much thinner as compared to 3-D because the
3D shell is not perfectly spherical and the contact discontinuity is crinkled
(see Fig. 12). The outer shock is weaker for a smaller NOB but its location
scales with the analytic scaling (∝ N1/5
OB ).

(20)

A steeper ηmech versus ng0, which is not inconsistent with Fig. 13, will give
an even better match. The important point to note is that a decreasing mech-
anical eﬃciency with an increasing ISM density, is required to explain the
critical NOB curve.

The scaling between NOB and gas density (hereafter critical curve) in
Fig. 14 can be compared with the empirical relation between star formation
rate (SFR) and gas density. The Kennicutt-Schmidt (hereafter KS) relation
(Schmidt 1959; Kennicutt 1998) between gas surface density and SFR sur-
face density is

ΣSFR

Σg

,

(21)

which is valid for Σg > 10 M⊙ pc−2, below which a much steeper relation
holds (Bigiel et al. 2008). Consider a scale height (H) of 100 pc and a disk
radius (Rd) of 1 kpc. For each OB star, the total stellar mass is ∼ 100 M⊙
for Kroupa/Chabrier initial mass function (Kroupa 2002; Chabrier 2003).
Then for a star formation time scale of 30 Myr, we have ΣSFR ≈ 10−6NOB
M⊙ yr−1 kpc−2 τ−1
d,kpc. For a gas density of ng0 cm−3, we also have
Σg ≈ 3 ng0H100pc M⊙ pc−2 for mean molecular weight µ = 1.3 (assum-
ing neutral/molecular disk). Therefore, the KS relation can be re-written in
terms of the parameters used in this paper as

An important point to note is that the scaling of NOB,KS with gas dens-
ity is somewhat shallower than the scaling for the critical curve (Eq. 20),

Figure 13. Eﬃciency of mechanical energy retention in superbubbles as
a function of ISM density for diﬀerent simulations. Clearly, the eﬃciency
decreases with an increasing density because of radiative losses. Colors rep-
resent NOB and the sizes of circles stand for diﬀerent times. Note that for
the same density, a higher NOB gives a slightly larger mechanical eﬃciency.
The black solid line shows the n−2/3
scaling of ηmech, which describes well
the variation of mechanical eﬃciency with the ambient density at almost
all times. For most runs, especially with high ambient densities (ng0 & 2
cm−3), the mechanical eﬃciency decreases by almost a factor of 10 from 5
to 30 Myr.

4.2 Radius - velocity distribution of HI supershells

Our setup provides an opportunity to study the observed properties of HI
shells supershells, especially the ones which are close to spherical and not
much aﬀected by the background density stratiﬁcation. Fig 15 compares the
radius-velocity distribution of observed HI supershells (Heiles 1979; Suad
et al. 2014; Bagetakos et al. 2011) with the evolution seen in our numer-
ical simulations; also shown are the Castor et al. (1975) analytic scalings.
We can write the radius and velocity of the shell in terms of the parameter
Lw,38/ng0 (luminosity Lw,38 ≈ NOB,2ES N,51 /τOB,30 is the mechanical lu-
minosity scaled to 1038 erg s−1) using Eq. 9 as

Lw,38
ng0

=   rsb

58 pc!2

sb

34 km s−1(cid:19)3

(cid:18)

.

(24)

The vertical colorbar in Fig. 15 shows the contours of constant L/ng0. The
‘(cid:3)’ symbols represent the radius and velocity obtained from our simula-
tions (NOB/ng0 ranges from 100 to 105); it is very encouraging that the
observed distribution of rsb − sb is similar to our simulations, which corres-
pond to reasonable star cluster parameters. The solid red color track marks
the evolution of a bubble with NOB ≈ 103 and ng0 = 1.0 cm−3, which cor-
responds to Lw,38/ng0 ≈ 10. But the track lies close to the analytic contours
of Lw,38/ng0 ≈ 0.5 − 1.0. It means that, for a given rsb − sb the adiabatic
theory overpredicts Lw,38/ng0 by a factor of ∼ 10 − 20. This discrepancy
is primarily due to large radiative losses; mechanical eﬃciency in Fig. 13
. 10% is consistent with the evolution in the rsb − sb space. Also we note
that some of the simulation points (below the t = 30 Myr line) have a dy-
namical age (≡ 5rsb/3sb) longer than the simulation time.

If SNe are the dominant cause of bubble formation, then we require
large OB associations for the creation of the observed HI supershells. In

Figure 14. Critical NOB required for a given density of the ISM for the su-
perbubble to remain suﬃciently overpressured at late times. The colorbar
and the size of squares (a smaller square means that ¯ηO is closer to 0.5) rep-
resent deviation from an average overpressure fraction of 0.5 at late times
(25 to 30 Myr). The best-ﬁt power-law scaling is indicated, and 3 −σ spread
about the best ﬁt is indicated by the grey shaded region.

order to quantify the size of OB associations, we also need to evaluate
the mechanical energy injection from stellar winds and radiation. However,
even without accounting for these additional energy/momentum sources,
the observed shells are much smaller and slower compared to what is expec-
ted from the predictions of adiabatic theory applied to the observed stellar
population – the so-called power problem in superbubbles (Oey 2009 and
references therein). Our simulations show that radiative losses can account
for the power problem.

4.3 Gas removal from clusters

Due to the presence of feedback from OB stars (radiative, stellar winds
and SNe) the star forming regions clear gas on timescales ∼ 106 yr
(Lada & Lada 2003). For clusters simulated by us the mstars/mcl ∼
0.17NOB,2/ng0r3
cl,100 < 1 (for each OB star, the total stellar mass is ∼ 100
M⊙ for Kroupa/Chabrier initial mass function), therefore the gravitational
well is largely provided by the cluster gas (this is also true for embedded
clusters buried in their natal molecular clumps). As a result of gas expul-
sion the cluster potential becomes shallower and the cluster may become
unbound depending on the ratio of gas removal timescale and dynamical
timescale of the cluster (Lada & Lada 2003). If the gas expulsion time is
long compared to the dynamical time, the stars can adiabatically attain new
viral equilibrium without being unbound. However, in the opposite regime
because of a suddenly reduced gravity majority of stars become unbound.
The timescale of gas expulsion is also important to account for multiple
populations observed in globular clusters (e.g., Krause et al. 2015 and ref-
erences therein).

While our simulations do not account for gravity that holds the
star cluster together (inclusion of gravity is important for strongly bound
massive clouds, not so much for smaller clumps with lower gravitational
binding energies), we can qualitatively understand the action of super-

ates (vertical colorbar; ηmech = 1 is used in Eq. 8), our numerical simula-
tions (colored squares; horizontal colorbar indicates time), and observations
(black and white symbols; Heiles 1979; Suad et al. 2014; Bagetakos et al.

ner radius in spherically averaged density proﬁles (RI) of the shell and the
velocity is obtained by dRI /dt. Solid black lines correspond to the dynam-
ical age (1.67rsb/sb; see Eqs. 7 & 8). The solid red line shows the evolution
of velocity and radius for NOB = 1000, ng0 = 1 cm−3, rcl = 100 pc. At early
times the line closely follows the analytic curve for Lw/ng0 = 1038 erg s−1
(corresponding to NOB = 100 and ng0 = 1 cm−3), with a factor ∼ 10 smaller
mechanical luminosity; at later times it dips even further. This is consistent
with the radiative eﬃciency of . 10%, which decreases with time (Fig. 13).

nova/stellar wind energy injection in gas expulsion from star clusters.
Fig. 16 shows the mass fraction mcl(t)/mcl(0) (mcl is the gas mass inside the
cluster radius, r < rcl) as a function of time for various values of NOB and
ng0. Since the ratio of energy injected by SNe to the gravitational potential
energy ∼ NOBESN/(Gµ2m2
cl,2) is large,
the eﬀect of neglecting gravity is negligible for the choice of our paramet-
ers (for simulations with gravity, see Calura et al. 2015; Krause et al. 2015).
We ﬁnd that the clusters are evacuated due to the formation of a superbubble
within . 10 Myr (Fig. 16). As expected, lower ISM density and higher NOB
evacuate the cluster gas in a shorter time. An estimate of evacuation times-
cale is given in Eq. 14. The estimate depends strongly on the cluster radius
(rcl) but is weakly sensitive to parameters such as ISM density, NOB, ηmech,
etc. The results in Fig. 16 are consistent with the timescale in Eq. 14; there-
fore, for diﬀerent parameters our numerical results can be scaled according
to the theoretical scaling.

5 CONCLUSIONS

We have carried out 3-D hydrodynamic simulations of supernovae (SNe) in
an OB association that creates and drives a superbubble. Our aim has been to
study the eﬀect of multiple SNe distributed over a limited region of a cluster,
on the ambient material far outside the cluster, and derive the dependence
of fundamental parameters such as the eﬃciency of energy deposition and
the critical number of SN required to create overpressured bubbles. Our set-
tings have been admittedly, and intentionally, kept idealized so that we can

perform controlled numerical experiments. Physical eﬀects such as mag-
netic ﬁelds, thermal conduction, stratiﬁcation, and inhomogeneities in the
ambient gas, which we have not included here, presumably do play import-
ant roles in superbubble formation and evolution, and will be the focus of
our future studies.

The broad astrophysical implications of our results are discussed in

section 4. Our key results can be summarized as follows:

• While isolated SNe ﬁzzle out by ∼ 1 Myr due to radiation losses, for a
realistic cluster size it is likely that subsequent SNe go oﬀ in a hot and tenu-
ous medium and sustain a shock lasting for the cluster lifetime ∼ 30 Myr,
comparable to the galactic dynamical timescale. 1-D numerical simulations
faithfully capture the global energetics but cannot, by construction, capture
morphological features such as the crinkling of the contact discontinuity
seen in 3-D.

• While most of the input energy is lost via radiative cooling, the super-
bubble retains a fraction ηmech of the input energy, and this fraction scales
as ηmech ∝ n−2/3
, being of order ∼ 6% for ng0 ∼ 1 cm−3 over a time period
of ∼ 30 Myr.

g0

• We have explored the parameter space of ISM density (ng0), number
of SNe (NOB) and star cluster radius (rcl) to study the conditions for the
formation of an overpressured superbubble. For realistic cluster sizes, we
ﬁnd that the bubble remains overpressured only if, for a given ng0, NOB is
larger than a threshold value. Our results show that threshold condition can
be roughly expressed as NOB,crit ∼ 200n1.9
g0 , where ng0 is the particle density
in cm−3.

• Classical adiabatic superbubble evolution overestimates the ratio of the
wind luminosity and the ISM density (Lw/ng0) by a factor of ∼ 10 − 20, by
not taking radiation losses into account. This explains the ‘power problem’
of the observed size and speed of superbubbles, and our simulations conﬁrm
that radiative losses are the reason for discrepancies between the size-speed
distribution of HI supershells and the sizes of OB associations driving them.
• We conﬁrm that a minimum value of NOB(& 104) is need to produce a
steady wind and a strong termination shock within the cluster region. For a
smaller number of SNe, all the supernova energy is deposited at the radiative
dense shell.

APPENDIX A: RADIUS DETERMINATION OF THE
SHELL

For 3−D simulations the dense shell is not perfectly spherical. Some ﬁgures
(e.g., Figs. 7, 15) show the evolution of the shell radius with time. Fig. A1
shows how we determine the inner and outer radii of the supershells. We
construct angle-averaged radial density proﬁles by dividing the simulation
box into spherical shells of thickness δr = δL, and averaging over all the
grid cells contained within the shell. The inner shell radius is taken at the
radius where ng = 0.98ng0 and the outer shell radius has ng = 1.02ng0.

run (ng0 = 1 cm−3, T0 = 104 K, NOB = 100, rcl = 100 pc) with diﬀerent
grid resolutions (see Table B1). The timestep is shorter for a higher grid
resolution as ∆t ∝ N−1, where N is the number of grid points along any
direction. Hence, the total computational cost scales ∝ N4, which becomes
prohibitive for a large number of grid-points. An optimum resolution, large

the shell radius for various grid resolutions. A larger energy is retained and
the overpressure fraction (Eq. 11) is larger for a higher resolution, but the
diﬀerence is small for the highest resolutions (δL = 1.27, 2.54 pc). The
evolution of the inner and outer shell radii are also similar.

Fig. B2 shows the density snapshots of four simulations with the grid
resolution of 1.27 pc, 2.54 pc and 3.57 pc and 4.53 pc at 9.55 Myr. The sim-
ulations with higher resolution better resolve the internal structures within
the bubble. Strict convergence is only expected with explicit viscosity and
thermal conductivity. Since molecular transport is negligible, we do not in-
clude these in our simulations. The run with δL = 2.54 pc looks morpholo-
gically very similar to the run with δL = 1.27 pc, but is ≈ 16 times faster.
Since simulations of the cluster over its typical lifetime (∼ 30 Myr) is com-
putationally expensive, we have chosen a resolution close to δL ≈ 2.54
(corresponding to run R2.5 in Table B1) for most of our simulations (see
Table 1).

Figure B1. Various volume-averaged quantities (kinetic energy, change in thermal energy, overpressure fraction, and inner and outer radii of the shell) for the
ﬁducial parameters (NOB = 100, ng = 1 cm−3, rcl = 100 pc) as a function of time for diﬀerent grid resolutions, δL = 1.27, 2.54, 3.57, 4.53 pc. The top two
and the bottom-left panels show binned data with a bin-size of 0.18 Myr. The results show convergence with an increasing resolution.

Figure B2. Density snapshots in the x − y plane at 9.55 Myr for the ﬁducial parameters but with various grid resolutions (see Table B1). The runs with higher
resolution better resolve the features at the bubble-shell interface. Yellow ﬁlled circles indicate the projected locations of SNe that have gone oﬀ.
