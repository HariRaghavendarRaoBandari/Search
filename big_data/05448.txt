COFIBRANT OBJECTS IN THE THOMASON MODEL

STRUCTURE

ROMAN BRUCKNER AND CHRISTOPH PEGEL

Abstract. There are Quillen equivalent Thomason model structures on the
category of small categories, the category of small acyclic categories and the
category of posets. These share the property that coﬁbrant objects are posets.
In fact, they share the same class of coﬁbrant objects. We show that every
ﬁnite semilattice, every chain, every countable tree, every ﬁnite zigzag and
every poset with ﬁve or less elements is coﬁbrant in all of those structures.

1. Introduction

In [Tho80], Thomason showed that there is a model structure on Cat—the cate-
gory of small categories—which is Quillen equivalent to the Quillen model structure
on sSet, the category of simplicial sets. This model structure has been lifted to
Pos, the category of posets in [Rap10], and to Ac, the category of small acyclic
categories in [Bru15]. In his original paper, Thomason already showed that every
coﬁbrant object in his model structure on Cat is a poset [Tho80, Proposition 5.7].
Since the model structures on Pos, Ac and Cat are coﬁbrantly generated by the
same classes of generating coﬁbrations and trivial coﬁbrations, and pushouts and
colimits along coﬁbrations yield the same objects in all of those, this implies that
all three categories feature the same class of coﬁbrant objects.

There have been many attempts to ﬁnd Thomason model structures on various
categories, e.g. the category of G–categories [BMO+15], the category of G–posets
[MSZ16], the category of strict n-categories [AM14] or the category of small n-fold
categories [FP10]. However, to the knowledge of the authors, there have been no
attempts to identify coﬁbrant objects in the Thomason model structure, except for
one chapter in [MSZ16].

In [MSZ16, Proposition 6.5] it was proved, that every ﬁnite one-dimensional poset
is coﬁbrant, i.e. every poset that has a 1-skeletal nerve. In this paper we identify
various other classes of coﬁbrant posets. In Section 3, we show that every ﬁnite
semilattice, every countable tree, every chain and every ﬁnite zigzag is coﬁbrant. In
Section 4 we show that every poset with ﬁve or less elements is coﬁbrant. Moreover,
we prove that every inclusion of a minimum into any of the coﬁbrant posets we
identiﬁed is a coﬁbration.

2. Preliminaries

We assume that the reader has some general knowledge on model categories and
the Thomason model structure and use this section primarily to ﬁx some notation
and terminology. We denote by ∆n the standard n–simplex, given by ∆n = N ([n])
where N : Cat → sSet is the usual nerve functor, and

[n] = 0 → 1 → · · · → n

the ﬁnite ordinal with n + 1 elements. Given a simplicial set X, the barycentric
subdivision is denoted by Sd X. In particular, given the barycentric subdivision of

1

2

ROMAN BRUCKNER AND CHRISTOPH PEGEL

a standard n–simplex, we denote the vertices of Sd ∆n by sets of vertices of ∆n.
For example,

(Sd ∆2)0 = {{0} , {1} , {2} , {0, 1} , {1, 2} , {0, 2} , {0, 1, 2}} .

By τ1 : sSet → Cat we denote the fundamental category functor, i.e. the left
adjoint of the nerve.

Given any poset P , we treat it as a category in the sense that there is an arrow
from x to y if and only if x ≤ y. In particular, when talking about the natural
numbers N, we are talking about the category

0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → · · · .

Furthermore, we denote by ∅ the initial, and by [0] the terminal object in Pos,
Cat, and Ac, respectively.

When we talk about the Thomason model structure, we mean the Thomason
model structure on either Pos, Ac, or Cat. In particular, when we use the term
category, we refer to an object in any Thomason model structure. Given any
category C, we denote by C(0) its class of objects and by C(1) its class of morphisms.
Given two categories C and D, we say that D is a retract of C, if ∅ → D is a retract
of ∅ → C.

We need a few theorems, that are used throughout this paper.

Theorem 2.1. The category τ1 Sd ∆n is coﬁbrant, and every inclusion

ik : [0] → τ1 Sd ∆n,

0 7→ {k}

is a coﬁbration.

Proof. This is found in the proof of [Cis99, Lemma 1].

(cid:3)

Lemma 2.2. Let C be a category. If [0] → C is a coﬁbration, C is coﬁbrant.

Proof. Since [0] lies in the image of τ1 Sd2, [0] is coﬁbrant, and since coﬁbrations are
closed under composition, ∅ → [0] → C is a coﬁbration and thus, C is coﬁbrant. (cid:3)

Moreover, note that since τ1 Sd2 is a left Quillen functor, and monomorphisms in
sSet are coﬁbrations, the image of a monomorphism under τ1 Sd2 is a coﬁbration
in the Thomason model structure. We will use this fact quite often throughout this
paper.

3. Trees, Zigzags, Chains and Semiattices

In this section, we proof that every countable tree, every ﬁnite zigzag, every

chain and every ﬁnite semilattice is coﬁbrant in the Thomason model structure.

3.1. Finite Semiattices. We ﬁrst show that the semilattices constructed from a
Boolean lattice by removing either the top, or the bottom element are coﬁbrant in
Lemma 3.3 and 3.4, respectively. In Theorem 3.5 we use the resulting semilattices
to construct arbitrary, ﬁnite semilattices as retracts of those. We start by giving
some deﬁnitions.

Deﬁnition 3.1. Let C be a small category, A ⊆ C(0). We denote by C \ A the full
subcategory of C with object set C(0) \ A. In particular, if A = {x}, we simply write
C \ x.

Deﬁnition 3.2. Let C be a small category. We denote by P(C) the category which
is given by the power set lattice of C(0).

COFIBRANT OBJECTS IN THE THOMASON MODEL STRUCTURE

In the following, we will denote the minimal element of P(C) by ∅, as opposed
to ∅ to avoid any confusion on whether we are talking about the minimal element
of P(C), or the initial object in the ambient category.

Lemma 3.3. The category P([n])\[n] is coﬁbrant and the inclusion [0] → P([n])\[n]
of the minimum is a coﬁbration.

Proof. Let ξ : Pos → Cat be the functor which maps a poset P to the lattice of
non-empty chains in P , ordered by inclusion. Then ξ = τ1 Sd N and ξ2 = τ1 Sd2 N
(cf. [Cis99]). Consider the diagram

[0]

i∅

ξ[0]

ι∅

[0]

i∅

,

P([n]) \ [n]

i

ξ(P([n]) \ [n])

p

P([n]) \ [n]

where i∅ and ι∅ are the minima inclusions, and i and p are given as follows: let
A = {m1, m2, . . . , mk} ∈ P([n]) \ [n], such that m1 ≤ m2 ≤ · · · ≤ mk. We set

i(A) = {{∅}, {m1}, {m1, m2}, . . . , {m1, m2, . . . , mk}}

and given B ∈ P([n]) \ [n], we set p(B) =S B.

It is easy to see, that p ◦ i = id, hence i∅ is a retract of ι∅. If we apply ξ to the
whole diagram, we get that ξ(i∅) = ι∅ is a retract of ξ(ι∅), which is a coﬁbration
since ξ(ι∅) = τ1 Sd2 N (i∅) and N (i∅) is a monomorphism in sSet. Hence i∅ is a
coﬁbration and P([n]) \ [n] is coﬁbrant.
(cid:3)

Lemma 3.4. The category P([n])\∅ is coﬁbrant and the inclusions of the respective
minima are coﬁbrations.
Proof. Since P([n]) \ ∅ ∼= τ1 Sd ∆n, this follows from 2.1.

(cid:3)

Theorem 3.5. Every ﬁnite semilattice is coﬁbrant.

Proof. Let L be a ﬁnite join–semilattice. Deﬁne

i : L → P(L) \ ∅,

x 7→ { y ∈ L | y ≤ x }

and

p : P(L) \ ∅ → L,

where W A denotes the join over all elements of A in L. Then p ◦ i = id, hence L is

a retract of P(L) \ ∅ and since P(L) \ ∅ is coﬁbrant by Lemma 3.4, so is L. Thus
every join–semilattice is coﬁbrant.

A 7→_ A,

Let M be a ﬁnite meet–semilattice. Since M op is a join–semilattice and P(M ) =

P(M op) we obtain a retract diagram

M op

i

P(M ) \ ∅

p

M op

,

where i and p are given as before. Dualizing every object we obtain a retract

iop

M

(P(M ) \ ∅)op

pop

M

.

But (P(M ) \ ∅)op is isomorphic to P(M ) \ M , which is coﬁbrant by Lemma 3.3
and hence so is M .
(cid:3)

Corollary 3.6. Let S be a ﬁnite semilattice, and im : [0] → S an inclusion that
maps the single element of [0] to a local minimum m in S, then im is a coﬁbration.

4

ROMAN BRUCKNER AND CHRISTOPH PEGEL

Proof. Let L be a ﬁnite join–semilattice, m ∈ L be a local minimum. Deﬁne

and

We obtain a diagram

im : [0] → L,
0 7→ m

ιm : [0] → P(L) \ ∅,

0 7→ {m} .

where i and p are given as in the proof of Theorem 3.5. It is easy to see that every
square commutes and since ιm is a coﬁbration by Theorem 2.1, so is im.

Now let M be a ﬁnite meet–semilattice, m ∈ M be the minimal element. Deﬁne

as before, and

im : [0] → M ,
0 7→ m

ι∅ : [0] → P(M ) \ M ,

0 7→ ∅.

Consider the isomorphisms

(P(M ) \ ∅)op ϕ

−→ P(M ) \ M

ψ
−→ (P(M ) \ ∅)op,

both of which are given by mapping a subset A ⊆ M to its complement. We obtain
a retract diagram

and since ι∅ is a coﬁbration by Lemma 3.3, so is im.

(cid:3)

3.2. Chains.

Deﬁnition 3.7. Let C be a category. We call C a chain if C is either isomorphic
to a ﬁnite ordinal [n], or to the natural numbers N.

Theorem 3.8. Every chain is coﬁbrant and the inclusion of the minimum is a
coﬁbration.

Proof. Let C be a chain.
If C is ﬁnite, then it is coﬁbrant by Theorem 3.5 and
the inclusion of the minimum is a coﬁbration by Corollary 3.6. Assume that C is
isomorphic to N. We will construct a sequence

X : N → Cat,

i 7→ Xi,
(i → i + 1) 7→ Fi

COFIBRANT OBJECTS IN THE THOMASON MODEL STRUCTURE

such that X0 is coﬁbrant, colimN X ∼= C, and the map X0 → colimN X is a coﬁ-
bration and the inclusion of the minimum, which yields that colimN X is coﬁbrant.
Let X0 = x0. Assume that

Xi = x0

f0−→ x1

f1−→ x2

f2−→ · · ·

fi−1−−−→ xi

and let D = x → y. We construct Xi+1 from Xi via the pushout

f

Fi

[0]

h

Xi

D

,

Xi+1

where f and h are given by f (0) = x and h(0) = xi. Since f is a coﬁbration
by Corollary 3.6, so is Fi. Moreover, since the class of coﬁbrations is closed under
transﬁnite composition, the map X0 → colimN X is a coﬁbration and thus colimN X
is coﬁbrant. Furthermore C is a universal co-cone for X by construction and thus
colimN X ∼= C.
(cid:3)

3.3. Finite Zigzags. We will proof that every ﬁnite zigzag is coﬁbrant by showing
that a certain class of zigzags is coﬁbrant (Lemma 3.10) and then glue together
arbitrary ﬁnite zigzags from elements of this class (Theorem 3.11). At ﬁrst, we
should give a deﬁnition of what we mean by zigzag.

Deﬁnition 3.9. A zigzag is a category Z, which is generated by a (possibly inﬁnite)
directed graph

· · · ↔ xi−1 ↔ xi ↔ xi+1 ↔ · · ·

where ↔ denotes either an arrow pointing to the left, or to the right.

Alternatively one might say a zigzag is a category generated by a total order

· · · → xi−2 → xi−1 → xi → xi+1 → xi+2 → · · ·

where some of the generating arrows are ﬂipped:

· · · ← xi−2 → xi−1 ← xi ← xi+1 → xi+2 → · · ·

Lemma 3.10. Let Z be a ﬁnite zigzag with a global maximum, then Z is coﬁbrant
and the minimum inclusions are coﬁbrations.

Proof. The claim is trivial for zigzags with one or less elements. Hence let Z be a
zigzag with n + 2 elements and a global maximum. If Z is isomorphic to [n + 1], Z
is coﬁbrant by Theorem 3.5 and we are done. Otherwise, we can write Z as

Z = x0

f0−→ · · ·

fi−2−−−→ xi−1

fi−1−−−→ xi

fi←− · · ·

fn←− xn+1.

Assume without loss of generality that i > n/2. By Theorem 2.1, the inclusions

ιk : [0] ֒→ τ1 Sd ∆n,

0 7→ {k}

are coﬁbrations. We construct Z as a retract of τ1 Sd ∆n and the inclusions
i0, in+1 : [0] → Z of the minima as retracts of ι0 and ιn, respectively. Deﬁne

i : Z → τ1 Sd ∆n,

{0, 1, . . . , k}
if k < i
{0, 1, . . . , n}
if k = i
{k − 1, k, . . . , n} if k > i

where k = l = 0 or k = n + 1, l = n. Since ι0 and ιn are coﬁbrations, so are i0 and
in+1. Hence Z is coﬁbrant by Lemma 2.2.
(cid:3)

Theorem 3.11. Every ﬁnite zigzag is coﬁbrant, and every inclusion of a minimum
into a zigzag is a coﬁbration.

Proof. Given a zigzag Zn, we prove the claim by induction over the number n of
local minima. If n = 1, Zn is a either a chain, hence coﬁbrant and the inclusion of
the minimum is a coﬁbration by Theorem 3.8, or can be obtained by gluing together
two chains C1, C2 along their minima via the pushout

where i and j are the respective minimum inclusions. Since i and j are coﬁbrations
by Theorem 3.8, so are α and β and thus, in particular, the compositions α ◦ j or
β ◦ i.

Now assume the for every n < N , a zigzag with n local minima is coﬁbrant, and
every inclusion of a minimum is a coﬁbration. Let ZN be a zigzag with N local
minima. There is a zigzag ZN −1 with N − 1 local minima, and a zigzag Z with a
global maximum, such that we can construct ZN via a pushout

[0]

where i0 and kN −1 are inclusions of local minima, hence coﬁbrations. Thus, so are

i1−→ Z κ−→ ZN ,

[0]

[0]

and

[0]

kj−→ ZN −1

κ−→ ZN ,

j = 1, . . . , N − 1,

where i1 is the other minimum inclusion of Z, and kj are the minimum inclusions
of ZN −1.
(cid:3)

COFIBRANT OBJECTS IN THE THOMASON MODEL STRUCTURE

Remark 3.12. Since the map ι from the previous proof is a coﬁbration, we can
construct some inﬁnite coﬁbrant zigzags with a countable number of objects via
transﬁnite composition, similar to the methods used in proof of Lemma 3.10. There
are however zigzags, where this will not work.

Assume that Z is a countable inﬁnite zigzag, with a ﬁnite number N of local

maxima. If

Z = · · · ⇆ xi−1 → xi ← xi+1 ← · · · ,

such that there are no more local extrema to the right of xi, then Z is not con-
structable as a pushout along a coﬁbration using the methods from the previous
proof.

3.4. Posets generated by directed trees. By a directed tree, we mean a directed
graph which is also a rooted tree, satisfying that every edge points away from the
root. There is a natural poset structure on the set of vertices: given two vertices
x, y, we say that x ≤ y if and only if the unique path from the root to y passes
through x. We call the resulting poset the poset generated by the tree.

Note that there is a natural grading on the resulting poset structure, where the
rank of an element x is given by the length of the minimal chain including x and the
root. We will now show, that any such poset is coﬁbrant in the Thomason model
structure, and that the inclusion of the root is a coﬁbration:

Theorem 3.13. Every countable poset generated by a directed tree is coﬁbrant, and
the inclusion of the root is a coﬁbration.

Proof. Let T be a countable poset generated by a directed tree, and rk: T → N
the associated rank function. We deﬁne a sequence

X : N → Cat,

i 7→ Xi,
(i → i + 1) 7→ Fi,

such that X0 is coﬁbrant, colimN X ∼= T and the map X0 → colimN X is coﬁbrant
and the inclusion of the root, which yields that T is coﬁbrant. For that purpose, let
X0 be the category with a single object r, and no non–identity morphisms. Assume
that Xi is a subposet of T that contains all elements with rank lower or equal to i.
If the rank of T is lower than i, we set Xi+1 = Xi. Otherwise we construct Xi+1
from Xi as follows: Let J ⊆ T be the set of all elements with rank i. Given j ∈ J,
we deﬁne

Kj := { t ∈ T | rk(t) = i + 1 and t ≥ j } ,

i.e. the set of all rank i + 1 elements that are smaller than j. Let D = x → y. We
obtain Xi+1 via the pushout

composition X0 → colimN X—which is also the inclusion of the root—is a coﬁbra-
tion. Hence by Lemma 2.2, colimN X is coﬁbrant. Furthermore T is a universal
co-cone for X by construction, which ﬁnishes the proof.
(cid:3)

4. Cofibrant objects with a fixed number of elements

In this section, we proof that every poset with ﬁve or less elements is coﬁbrant
and that their respective inclusions of minima are coﬁbrations. Most of those
posets are already covered by previous theorems, so there are only a handful of
posets which we have to construct by hand. Before starting with the proofs, we
need a small lemma which we use throughout this section.

Lemma 4.1. Let Q be a poset, A ⊆ Q a subset and i : A → [n] an injective map
of sets. Let furthermore

m : N (aa∈A

[0]) → ∆n

0a 7→ i(a)

be a map in sSet. If there is a retract h : `a∈A[0] → Q of τ1 Sd2 m satisfying

h(0a) = a, then the poset P obtained by the pushout

[0]

`a∈A

h

Q

[0]

α

P

is coﬁbrant, and the inclusion α is a coﬁbration.
Proof. Since m is a monomorphism, τ1 Sd2 m is a coﬁbration and thus, so is h.
Hence α is a coﬁbration and by Lemma 2.2, P is coﬁbrant.
(cid:3)

4.1. Posets with four or less elements.

Theorem 4.2. Every poset with three or less elements is coﬁbrant, and every
inclusion of a local minimum into one of those posets is a coﬁbration.

Proof. Every connected poset with three or less elements is a semilattice, hence
coﬁbrant by Theorem 3.5 and the inclusions are coﬁbrations by the Corollary 3.6.
Furthermore, since coproducts of coﬁbrant objects are coﬁbrant, every poset with
three or less elements is coﬁbrant.
(cid:3)

Theorem 4.3. Every poset with four elements is coﬁbrant, and the respective in-
clusions of minima are coﬁbrations.

Proof. Every poset with four elements that is a coproduct of coﬁbrant posets is
coﬁbrant, hence every disconnected poset with four or less elements is coﬁbrant
by Theorem 4.2. Up to isomorphism, there are ten connected posets with four
elements. Eight of those are semilattices, hence coﬁbrant by Theorem 3.5, and
their respective inclusions of minima are coﬁbrant by Corollary 3.6.

P1

where ιb1 and ιx are given by ιb1 (0) = b1 and ιx(0) = x respectively. Since ιb1
and ιx are coﬁbrations by Theorem 4.2, so are α and β and hence—in particular—
the compositions with the respective inclusions of minima into D and E and every
inclusion of a minimum into P1 can be written as such a composition.

Regarding P2, consider the pushout

τ1 Sd2 ∂∆1

h

τ1 Sd2 ∆1

[0]

α ,

P2

where h is the usual boundary inclusion. Since h is a coﬁbration, so is α. Hence by
Lemma 2.2, P2 is coﬁbrant. Note that α is one of the inclusion 0 7→ xk, and since
P2 is symmetric, the other inclusion has to be a coﬁbration as well.
(cid:3)

4.2. Posets with ﬁve Elements. In this section, we will show that every poset
with ﬁve or less elements is coﬁbrant, and that every inclusion of a minimum
into one of those is a coﬁbration. As before, we only have to consider posets
that are connected. According to the Chapel Hill Poset Atlas 1, there are up to
isomorphism 44 connected posets with ﬁve elements. 25 of those are semilattices.
Of the remaining 19, nine can be constructed via simple pushouts in a similar
fashion to P1 in the previous proof, i.e. by gluing a category with two elements
and a single non-identity morphism between those two to a coﬁbrant poset with
four elements. Of the remaining ten, one is τ1 Sd2 ∆1. To see that the inclusion of
{{0, 1}} is a coﬁbration, we have to construct it by gluing two copies of the poset
E from the previous section together at one of their respective local minima.

h

˜P

[0]

ix2

P1

COFIBRANT OBJECTS IN THE THOMASON MODEL STRUCTURE

where ix2(0) = x2. We have to show that h is a coﬁbration. For that purpose, let

m : ∂∆1 → ∆2,

0 7→ 0,
1 7→ 2

in sSet. Since m is a monomorphism, τ1 Sd2 m is a coﬁbration. We will construct
h as a retract of τ1 Sd2 m. Consider the embedding of ˜P into τ1 Sd2 ∆2 given as
follows:

x1

y1

y2

x2a

Folding this along the axis between x1 and x2b , we obtain

From here, it is easy to see that we can obtain h as a retract of τ1 Sd2 m as indicated
in the diagram above. Hence ix2 is a coﬁbration and by symmetry, so is ix3 : [0] →
P1, given by ix3(0) = x3. Thus by Lemma 2.2, P1 is coﬁbrant.

To show that the inclusion

is a coﬁbration, we need to construct P1 diﬀerently. Consider the poset Q given by

ix1 : [0] → P1,
0 7→ x1

and let

Q =

Taking the pushout

where h is the usual boundary inclusion, we obtain the poset ˜P given by

˜P =

x1

The map ιx1 : [0] → Q, given by ιx1(0) = x1 is a coﬁbration by Theorem 4.3, and
since h is a coﬁbration, so is α and in particular the composition α ◦ ιx1 . We will
construct ix1 as a retract of α ◦ ιx1. For that purpose, let

and

i : P1 → ˜P
x1 7→ x1,
x2 7→ x2,

p : ˜P → P1
x1 7→ x1,
x2 7→ x2,

x3 7→ y2,
yk 7→ zk

y1 7→ y1,
y2 7→ x3,
y3 7→ y2.

z1 7→ y1,
z2 7→ y2,

It is easy to see that p ◦ i = id and that this gives ix1 as a retract of α ◦ ιx1 .

Lemma 4.5. The poset P2 is coﬁbrant, and every inclusion of a minimum into P2
is a coﬁbration.

Proof. Let

m : ∂∆1 → ∆1,

0 7→ 0,
1 7→ 1

in sSet. Since m is a monomorphism, τ1 Sd2 m is a coﬁbration. Let Q be the poset

for k = 1, 3. Let

ιak : [0] → Q,
0 7→ ak

ixk : [0] → P2,
0 7→ xk,

where k = 1, 2, 3. We will construct ix1 as a retract of ιb1 via the retract diagram

It is easy to see that p ◦ i = id. Hence ix1 is a coﬁbration and by symmetry, so are
ix2 and ix3.
(cid:3)

Lemma 4.6. The poset P3 is coﬁbrant, and every inclusion of a minimum into P3
is a coﬁbration.

14

ROMAN BRUCKNER AND CHRISTOPH PEGEL

Proof. We will give two constructions of P3. One for each of the inclusions of x1
and x2 respectively. Let

y2

z

˜P1 =

y1

x1a

x1b

and

˜P2 =

Similar to the proof of P1 being coﬁbrant, we construct coﬁbrant maps

hk : τ1 Sd2 ∆1 → ˜Pk,
{{0}} 7→ xka ,
{{1}} 7→ xkb

as retracts of an inclusion τ1 Sd2 m : τ1 Sd2 ∂∆1 → τ1 Sd2 ∆2, and then obtain P3
via pushouts

Let

We obtain h1 as a retract of τ1 Sd2 m as indicated in the diagram below

and h2 as a retract of τ1 Sd2 m as follows:

y1

z

x2a

y2

x2b

.

Note that we skipped the step where we apply the folding from the proof of The-
orem 4.4. Since m is a monomorphism in sSet, τ1 Sd2 m is a coﬁbration and thus,
so is hk for k = 1, 2.
(cid:3)

Lemma 4.7. The poset P4 is coﬁbrant, and every inclusion of a minimum into P4
is a coﬁbration.

Proof. Again, we have to construct P4 twice, once to show that the inclusion

ix : [0] → P4,

0 7→ x

is a coﬁbration, and once to show that

iy2 : [0] → P4,
0 7→ y2

is a coﬁbration.

We will start with ix. Let D = x → y, and Q be the poset given by

Q =

y1

z2

z1

y2

.

We obtain P4 via the pushout

ιy

[0]

ιy1

P4

where ιy(0) = y and ιy1 (0) = y1. Since ιy1 is a coﬁbration by Theorem 4.3, so is α
and hence in particular the composition ix = α ◦ ιx where ιx : [0] → D is given by
ιx(0) = x.

To show that iy2 is a coﬁbration, let ˜P be the poset

z1

˜P =

y2a

z2

y2b

.

y1

16

ROMAN BRUCKNER AND CHRISTOPH PEGEL

We will use the same procedure as before, i.e. construct the two–point embedding

h : τ1 Sd2 ∆1 → ˜P ,
{{0}} 7→ y2a,
{{1}} 7→ y2b

as a retract of a two–point embedding into the folded τ1 Sd2 ∆2 as indicated by the
following diagram:

x

y1

z1

z2

y2a

y2b

.

Then apply Lemma 4.1 to glue ˜P together at y2a and y2b.

(cid:3)

Lemma 4.8. The poset P5 is coﬁbrant, and every inclusion of a minimum into P5
is a coﬁbration.

Proof. Let

z1

Q1 =

and

z2

yb

and

Q2 =

ya

x1

x2

ιxk : [0] → Q2,
0 7→ xk

for k = 1, 2. Then we can construct P5 via the pushout

ιyb

[0]

ιya

Q1

Q2

α ,

P5

where ιya and ιyb are given by ιya (0) = ya and ιyb(0) = yb. Since ιya is a coﬁbration
by Corollary 3.6, so is α and thus in particular the compositions α ◦ ixk for k = 1, 2.
By Lemma 2.2, P5 is coﬁbrant and the minima inclusions are coﬁbrations.
(cid:3)

Lemma 4.9. The poset P6 is coﬁbrant, and every inclusion of a minimum into P6
is a coﬁbration

COFIBRANT OBJECTS IN THE THOMASON MODEL STRUCTURE

Proof. Let Q be the poset

y1b

x2

y2

x1

x3

,

y1c

Q =

y1a

and let h : `3

as a retract of

i=1[0] → Q be the inclusion with image {y1a, y1b, y1c}. We obtain h

m : N (

We can construct P6 via the pushout

P6

Hence by Lemma 4.1, P6 is coﬁbrant and the inclusion of y1 into P6 is a coﬁbration
and by symmetry, so is the inclusion of y2.
(cid:3)

Theorem 4.10. The poset P7 is coﬁbrant, and every inclusion of a minimum into
P7 is a coﬁbration.

18

ROMAN BRUCKNER AND CHRISTOPH PEGEL

Proof. Let Q be the poset

Q =

a1

c1

b1

c2

b2

c3

a2

.

We will obtain a coﬁbrant embedding

as a retract of the inclusion

ix1 : [0] → P7,
0 7→ x1

ιa1 : [0] → Q,
0 7→ a1,

and ιa1 as a pushout of a retract of the boundary inclusion τ1 Sd2 ∂∆2 → τ1 Sd2 ∆2.
We will start with the embedding of the folded boundary into the folded τ1 Sd2 ∆2:

{{0, 1, 2}}

{{0, 1}}

Folding again at the axis between {{0, 1}} and {{0, 1, 2}} as indicated in the dia-
gram above, we obtain

We will denote the resulting inclusion by m : B → S. We obtain the poset Q by
taking the pushout

.

B

and since m is a coﬁbration, so is ιa1 . Let

and

i : P7 → Q,
xk 7→ ak,
yk 7→ bk,
z 7→ c2

p : Q → P7,
ak 7→ xk,
bk 7→ yk,

c1 7→ y1,
c2 7→ z,
c3 7→ y2.

Then p ◦ i = id and the diagram

[0]

commutes. Thus, ix1 is a coﬁbration and by symmetry, so is ix2 : [0] → P7, given
by ix2(0) = x2. Applying Lemma 2.2 yields that P7 is coﬁbrant.
(cid:3)

Lemma 4.11. The poset P8 is coﬁbrant, and the inclusion of the minimum into
P8 is a coﬁbration.

Proof. Let Q and R be the posets given by

z1

Q =

y1

z2

y3

y2

x

and let

y1

y2

and

R =

x

h : R → Q,
y1 7→ y1,
y2 7→ y3,
x 7→ x.

Consider the embedding m : ∆1 → ∆2 that maps ∆1 to the 1-simplex between 0
and 1. We obtain h as a retract of τ1 Sd2 m as indicated by the following diagram
(where we skipped the usual folding and the image of τ1 Sd2 m is located at the
bottom of the diagram):

z1

y1

y2

z2

Now let D = x → y, and

We obtain P8 via the pushout

f : R → D,
yk 7→ y,
x 7→ x.

α .

P8

Since m is a monomorphism in sSet, τ1 Sd2 m is a coﬁbration and hence, so is h.
Thus α is a coﬁbration, and since the inclusion ιx : [0] → D given by ιx(0) = x is a
coﬁbration, so is the composition ix = α ◦ ιx, which is the inclusion of the minimum
into P8. Hence by Lemma 2.2, P8 is coﬁbrant.
(cid:3)

Theorem 4.12. The poset P9 is coﬁbrant, and every inclusion of a minimum is a
coﬁbration

Proof. Let

and

z

˜P =

y1

x1a

y2

x2

x1b

h : τ1 Sd2 ∂∆1 → ˜P ,

{{0}} 7→ x1a ,
{{1}} 7→ x1b .

Then P9 is given by the pushout diagram

τ1 Sd2 ∂∆1

h

˜P

[0]

,

ix1

P9

where ix1 is the inclusion given by ix1(0) = x1. Let furthermore

h : ∂∆1 → ∆2,

0 7→ 0,
1 7→ 1

in sSet. We obtain h as a retract of τ1 Sd2 m as indicated by the following diagram:

x2

z

y1

y2

x1a

x1b

.

COFIBRANT OBJECTS IN THE THOMASON MODEL STRUCTURE

21

Hence h is a coﬁbration and thus, so is ix1 (and by symmetry, so is ix2 : [0] → P9,
given by ix2(0) = x2). So by Lemma 2.2, P9 is coﬁbrant.
(cid:3)

Combining all of our previous results, we have proved the following theorem:

Theorem 4.13. Every poset with ﬁve or less elements is coﬁbrant, and the respec-
tive inclusions of minima are coﬁbrations.

5. Appendix

The posets on the following pages are mostly computer generated with the data
pulled from Chapel Hill Poset Atlas. We denote the posets by their generating
graphs. That means that we will only use anonymous nodes, instead of named
objects and will only draw the minimal generating set of arrows, i.e. those arrows,
that are indecomposable.

Moreover, when arranging the objects, we put our focus on avoiding crossing

arrows.

5.1. Posets with 4 or less elements. There is exactly one poset with one ele-
ment, and one connected poset with two.

There are three connected posets with three elements, and all three are semilat-

tices:

There are ten connected posets with four elements, eight of those are semilattices,

namely:

.

and the remaining two are the posets P1 and P2 from Theroem 4.3:

.

5.2. Posets with 5 Elements. There are 44 connected posets with ﬁve elements,
25 of those are semilattices and listed below:

.

22

ROMAN BRUCKNER AND CHRISTOPH PEGEL

Of the remaining 19, nine can be constructed by gluing the connected poset with
two elements along its minimum to a coﬁbrant poset with four elements. Those are

.

Of the remaining ten, one is τ1 Sd2 ∆1:

.

The remaining nine are the posets P1 to P9 from Section 4.2.
