Abstract

We ﬁnd formulas of the Chebyshev-polynomial expansion of the energy dependence
of the inverse localization length of Hermitian and non-Hermitian random chains. For
Hermitian models, the expansion numerically produces the energy dependence as a function
in one run of the algorithm. This is in strong contrast to the standard transfer-matrix method,
which produces the inverse localization length for a ﬁxed energy in each run. For non-
Hermitian models, our algorithm also produces the inverse localization length for a ﬁxed
(complex) energy. We also ﬁnd a formula of the Chebyshev-polynomial expansion of the
density of states of non-Hermitian models. In all cases, we do not need to store the entire
matrix in computer memory because the algorithm is based on the multiplication of the
Hamiltonian matrix. Our algorithm for non-Hermitian models may be the only available
one that enables us to ﬁnd the density of states of models with interactions.

1 Introduction

Impurities are ubiquitous in nature and play an essential role in various physical phenomena;
one of the most important is the Anderson localization. Anderson [1] originally introduced the
concept to describe localization of electrons diffusing in random lattices but later on it has been

1

applied to various other systems where waves are present in a random environment; see e.g.
Ref. [2]. Waves, quantum mechanical or classical, that are scattered by random impurities tend
to interfere destructively with each other and localized in space under speciﬁc conditions.

The thus localized wave typically has exponential tails:

ψ(x) ∼ e−κ|x−x0|,

(1)

where x0 is the center of localization. The index κ speciﬁes how strongly the wave is localized
and referred to as the inverse localization length. A small value of κ indicates a widely localized
wave, while a large value a narrowly (strongly) localized one.

For quantum mechanical systems in large regular environments, the inverse localization
length κ of each eigenstate of the Hamiltonian depends on its eigenenergy; the function κ(E)
is typically larger near energy bounds and smaller away from them, even vanishes in an energy
region. It is now widely accepted that, without particle-particle interactions, almost all eigen-
states are localized, that is, κ(E) > 0 for any E, in one dimension, while there is an energy
region of κ(E) = 0, namely an extended phase, in three dimensions with a transition to a local-
ized phase at a so-called mobility edge. It has been stressed [3, 4, 5, 6] that a detailed ﬁnite-size
scaling analysis of numerical data is essential to ﬁx precisely the exponent ν, which indicates
how the inverse localization length in the localized phase vanishes at the mobility edge Ec as
in κ(E) ∼ |E − Ec|ν, and thereby the universality class of the Anderson localization transi-
tion. Numerical methods of computing the inverse localization length precisely are still in need
for more intricate systems, such as quantum Hall systems, spin-orbit systems and topological
insulators.

In the present paper, we introduce a new numerical method of computing the energy depen-
dence of the inverse localization length κ(E); we discover an expansion of the function κ(E)
in terms of the Chebyshev polynomials Tn(E). The most popular method present is presum-
ably to ﬁnd it as the Lyapunov exponent of the random transfer matrix. Our new method is
completely different; it extracts the inverse localization length from the density of states of the
Hamiltonian. The most prominent difference may be the following point. Each run of the trans-
fer matrix method ﬁnds the inverse localization length for a very large system at a ﬁxed energy.
In contrast, each run of our method ﬁnds κ(E) as a function for a moderately large system.

We also present an algorithm of computing the inverse localization length of non-Hermitian
Hamiltonians in the complex energy plane, using again the Chebyshev-polynomial expansion.
Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and Liouvillians can appear in quantum mechanics when the en-
vironment is traced out in open quantum systems [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. Interest
in non-Hermitian quantum mechanics was renewed in 90’s, when several important studies on
non-Hermitian Hamiltonians appeared, including a non-Hermitian extension of a model of the
Anderson localization [17, 18, 19] and the PT -symmetric quantum mechanics [20, 21, 22]. In
the former, the competition between randomness and non-Hermiticity was found; the inverse
localization length vanishes at the critical value of a non-Hermitian parameter. If we go further
away from the realm of quantum mechanics, the presence of randomness in non-Hermitian ma-
trices is quite common, such as in the Fokker-Planck dynamics [24], ﬂuid dynamics [25] and
in neural networks [23], and the concept of the Anderson localization ﬂourishes. Our method

2

should come in handy in analyzing such non-Hermitian systems.

The paper is organized as follows. We ﬁrst review in Section 2.1 the Chebyshev-polynomial
expansion of the density of states ρ(E) of Hermitian Hamiltonians. We then move on to our
new Chebyshev-polynomial expansion of the inverse localization length κ(E) in Section 2.2.
We present in Section 2.3 two demonstrations of the method, employing the random-potential
and random-hopping tight-binding models.

We turn to our method for the inverse localization length of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians in
Section 3. After the derivation of the expansion formula, we give a demonstration of it, using
the non-Hermitian random-sign model.

We ﬁnally present the method for the density of states of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians in

Section 4. A demonstration with non-Hermitian random matrices follows.

2 Method for the localization length of Hermitian chains

2.1 Chebyshev-polynomial method of computing the density of states

Let us ﬁrst brieﬂy overview the Chebyshev-polynomial expansion method of computing the
density of states of a (Hermitian) Hamiltonian matrix [26, 27, 28]. The method with the er-
ror due to the termination of expansion taken care of is often called the kernel-polynomial
method [29]. Throughout the paper, we only employ the straightforward simple Chebyshev-
polynomial expansion without dealing with termination errors. The method works best for
large sparse matrices, to which point we will come back below.

Suppose that an L × L Hermitian matrix H has the real (unknown) eigenvalues {Eν|ν =

1, 2,· · · , L}. Its density of states is given by
1
L

ρ(E) :=

L

Xν=1

δ(E − Eν),

(2)

where δ(x) is Dirac’s delta function. The strategy is to expand the density of states ρ(E) in
terms of a set of orthogonal polynomials; often used is the Chebyshev polynomial. To employ
the Chebyshev polynomial, we have to normalize the matrix H so that all eigenvalues Eν lie
in the range [−1, 1], which is the support of the Chebyshev polynomial; the upper and lower
bounds of the eigenvalue spectrum are roughly estimated e.g. by the Gershgorin circle theorem.
We assume that the matrix H has been already normalized properly throughout this and next
subsections.

The Chebyshev polynomials of the ﬁrst kind, which are deﬁned on [−1, 1] by

Tn(x) := cos(n arccos x),

constitute a set of orthogonal polynomials that satisfy the orthogonality

for n = m = 0,

and the recursion relation

Tn+1(x) = 2xTn(x) − Tn−1(x)

(5)

with T0(x) = 1 and T1(x) = x. The even-order and odd-order polynomials are even and odd
functions, respectively.

If we assume the expansion of the density of states in the form

The key aspect of the method is the fact that we can evaluate the expansion coefﬁcients by
numerical matrix multiplication. Using the diagonalizing bases of the matrix H, we can show
that the matrix polynomial Tn(H) should satisfy the recursion relation of the same form as
Eq. (5):

Tn+1(H) = 2HTn(H) − Tn−1(H)

(12)

with T0(H) = I, which is the L × L identity matrix, and T1(H) = H. We can therefore
recursively generate the matrix polynomial Tn(H) by matrix multiplications (once every order),
and thereby ﬁnd the expansion coefﬁcient 1

L Tr Tn(H) in Eq. (11).

In practical numerical calculation, we of course have to truncate the summation over n in
the expansion (11). The deﬁnition (3) of the Chebyshev polynomial implies that the truncation
at the Nth order can reproduce structures up to the resolution of order 1/N. On the other hand,
the level spacing is of order 1/L for a matrix with an almost uniform density of states, which
means that the truncation at the order N & L is legitimate for ﬁnding the general feature of the
density of states. There have also been devised various methods of minimizing the truncation
errors [29]; for simplicity of demonstrations, however, we do not employ any such methods
throughout the paper.

As another comment, any kinds of orthogonal polynomial should work in the expansion
but the Chebyshev polynomial usually works best in practical numerical calculations. We use
only the Chebyshev polynomial in the present paper. For problems without ﬁnite bounds of the
spectrum, e.g., for a random model with the Cauchy (Lorentzian) distribution, we would need
an orthogonal polynomial with an inﬁnite support.

For very large matrices, the trace operation in Eq. (11) is often replaced by Monte Carlo
summation over a set of basis vectors less than L. We can then carry out the matrix multiplica-
tion by storing only a few vectors in the computer memory rather than storing the whole matrix;
for sparse matrices, in particular, the multiplication of the L × L matrix to a vector takes the
CPU time only of order L. This is the advantage of the Chebyshev-polynomial method over the
diagonalization of the matrix itself. For the sake of demonstration, however, we here throughout
the paper use only matrices that we can store in the computer memory.

2.2 Chebyshev-polynomial expansion of the inverse localization length

We now introduce the Chebyshev-polynomial expansion of the inverse localization length κ(E)
of the Hermitian one-dimensional random tight-binding model. The idea is simple; we employ
the Thouless formula [30], which relates the inverse localization length κ(E) to the density of
states ρ(E) in the form

κ(E) =Z 1

−1

ρ(x) ln |E − x|dx − ln|t|,

(13)

where |t| is the geometric mean of the modulus of the hopping elements. We can sketch the
derivation of the Thouless formula as follows. The end-to-end Green’s function G1L(E) of a
chain of length L under open boundary conditions is given by

G1L(E) =

L−1

tx,x+1

Yx=1
det(E − H)

=

L−1

L

tx,x+1

Yx=1
Yν=1
(E − Eν)

,

(14)

while it presumably decays as exp(−κ(E)L). Taking logarithm of the moduli of the both sides
of Eq. (14) results in the formula (13) with ln|t| being the average of ln|tx,x+1|.

5

Let us insert the Chebyshev-polynomial expansion of the density of states, Eq. (6), into the

Thouless formula (13):

κ(E) =

Xn=0

µnfn(E) − ln|t|,

where

fn(E) :=Z 1

for n > 0 along with

f0(E) = −π ln 2.

We thereby arrive at the expansion

Xn=1

Tn(E) − ln 2|t|.

(15)

(16)

(17)

(19)

Note the resemblance of the factor 1/n to the expansion of logarithm ln(1 − x). Indeed, the
simple insertion of Eq. (2) into Eq. (13) results in

κ(E) =

1
L

ln|E − Eν| − ln|t| =

1

Tr ln|E − H| − ln|t|,

(20)

Xν=1

from which we can directly derive the expansion (19). Thanks to the logarithmic factor 1/n in
the expansion coefﬁcient, higher-order Chebyshev polynomials contribute less in the expansion
of κ(E) than in the one of ρ(E), and hence the former is generally smoother than the latter, as
we will demonstrate below. Despite the simpleness of the idea, this is, as far as we know, the
ﬁrst appearance of the Chebyshev-polynomial expansion of the inverse localization length.

2.3 Demonstration

Let us demonstrate the Chebyshev-polynomial expansion of the density of states, Eq. (11) [26,
27, 28], as well as that of the inverse localization length, Eq. (19), for random-potential and
random-hopping tight-binding models. First, Fig. 1 shows the results for the random-potential
model

Chebyshev-polynomial expansion up to the 1000th order of the random-potential chain (21)
of length L = 101 under open boundary conditions. We took the arithmetic average over the
same set of 1000 random samples. For comparison, we also plotted in (b) as the green dots the
inverse localization length given in Fig. 14 of Ref. [18], which was deduced by monitoring the
change of the spectrum as we increase the real parameter g for one sample of a non-Hermitian
extension of the random-potential chain, Eq. (22), of length L = 1000 under periodic boundary
conditions. (c) An example of the spectrum of the model (22) of length L = 10000 for g = 0.5

to the 1000th order. We here used only one random sample of the random-potential chain (21)
of length L = 1001.

we sampled the potential Vx at each site randomly from the uniform distribution on [−1, 1],
making t the unit of energy. Both in Fig. 1 (a) and (b), we computed the arithmetic average over
the same set of 1000 random samples of length L = 101 under open boundary conditions and
terminated the Chebyshev-polynomial expansion at the 1000th order.

Notice that the result of our expansion of the localization length κ(E) in Fig. 1 (b) is much
smoother than that of the density of states ρ(E) in Fig. 1 (a). This is presumably because,
as we mentioned at the end of Section 2.2, higher-order polynomials contribute less in the
expansion of κ(E) than in the expansion of ρ(E). We show in Fig. 2 the modulus of the factor
1
L Tr Tn(H) in the expansion coefﬁcients. This quantity decays exponentially until the ﬁrst 20
to 30 terms (Fig. 2 (a)), after which it ﬂuctuates around 0.01 except for occasional very small
values (Fig. 2 (b)). (We saw similar dependence of the quantity for the random-hopping model
used below.) This means that the numerical evaluation of the density of states (11) needs quite
many terms, while that of Eq. (19) can be quite stable; the numerical error of lacking the 1000th
term in the evaluation of the inverse localization length would result in an error less than 10−5
because the expansion coefﬁcient is divided by the number of the order, whereas that of the
density of states would be of order 10−2, which is indeed the order of ﬂuctuation of the plot in
Fig. 1 (a).

We can argue in another way that the zigzag in Fig. 1 (a) is due to the truncation of the
expansion rather than due to the delta peaks of the individual eigenvalues. In Fig. 1 (a), we
have about 105 eigenvalues (1000 samples of 101 eigenvalues) rather uniformly distributed in
the range around [−1.5, 1.5], which implies that the average level spacing is about 3× 10−5. On
the other hand, the resolution due to the truncation of the expansion is of order 4 × 10−3, which
is too coarse to see the delta peaks of individual eigenvalues.
In contrast, such truncation errors are virtually invisible in Fig. 1 (b). This demonstrates the
high potential of our Chebyshev-polynomial expansion of the localization length. A disadvan-
tage may be the fact that the expansion produces the localization length for the energy ranges

8

where the states actually do not exist. This is a common problem of the Thouless formula [30].
Incidentally, we superimpose on Fig. 1 (b) a numerical estimate of κ(E) by an independent
method given in Refs. [17, 18, 19], where a non-Hermitian extension of the random tight-
binding model was introduced by making the amplitude of the hopping to the right different
from the one to the left:

(22)

where g is a real constant with periodic boundary conditions being assumed. It was shown [17,
18, 19] that an eigenstate for g = 0 with the inverse localization length κ is delocalized upon
increasing the asymmetric parameter g up to g = κ and at the same time the corresponding
eigenvalue, unchanged for g < κ, starts moving in the complex energy plane. We can thus ob-
tain the estimate of κ(E) of the Hermitian random model, which is superimposed on Fig. 1 (b),
by monitoring the movement of the eigenvalues (not the eigenvectors) that the change of the
real parameter g gives rise to; e.g. in Fig. 1 (c), the states on the endpoints of the bubble of
the spectrum for g = 0.5 has the inverse localization κ = 0.5 for g = 0. The result from the
model (22) is indeed consistent with the present estimate of κ(E).

Next, we present the results for the random-hopping model

(23)

see Fig. 3. We here sampled the hopping element at each link tx from a uniform distribution
on [−t − ∆,−t + ∆] with ∆/t = 0.5. Both in Fig. 3 (a) and (b), we computed the arithmetic
average over the same set of 1000 random samples of length L = 1001 under open boundary
conditions and terminated the Chebyshev-polynomial expansion at the 10000th order.

Note the sharp peak of the density of states and a dip of the inverse localization length at
E = 0. It is widely accepted [31, 32, 33, 34, 35] that the random-hopping chain (23) has a
diverging density of states around E = 0 and the corresponding singularity of the localization
length:

ρ(E) ∼(cid:12)(cid:12)E(ln E2)3(cid:12)(cid:12)
κ(E) ∼(cid:12)(cid:12)ln E2(cid:12)(cid:12)

Since the eigenvalue spectrum of the random-hopping chain (23) is exactly symmetric with
respect to E = 0, the chains of odd length has an eigenstate with the zero eigenvalue, namely
the zero mode.

Let us take a look at the zero mode here from the point of view of the Chebyshev-polynomial

where we took advantage of the fact that only the even-order terms contribute because the spec-
trum of this model is symmetric with respect to E = 0. We have noticed that in our numerical
data that the factor Tr T2m(H) almost alternates in sign with respect to m, which makes the
series non-alternating when combined with the factor (−1)m. Because of this behavior, the es-
timates of ρ(0) and κ(0) change monotonically as we increase the cutoff N/2 of the summation
over m. Figure 4 shows the cutoff-dependence of the two quantities ρ(0) and κ(0). The former
increases and the latter decreases seemingly in power of the cutoff N, which indeed suggests
that the density of states diverges and the inverse localization length vanishes at E = 0.

3 Method for the localization length of non-Hermitian chains

For non-Hermitian matrices, we need a method of evaluating the density of states and the lo-
calization length on the complex energy plane. A naive extension of the polynomial-expansion
method to non-Hermitian matrices might be to ﬁnd a double expansion with respect to the real

the average and the error from 24 random samples.

and imaginary parts of the energy; such double expansions themselves were indeed found e.g.
for speciﬁc functions appearing in the random matrix theory [37, 38]. The straightforward
generalization of the Chebyshev-polynomial method would not work, however, at least in an
obvious way; we would not be able to generate the coefﬁcients of the double expansion by
means of the simple recursion relation (12).

3.1 Method of Hermitization

In order to resolve the issue, we employ the method of Hermitization proposed by Feinberg and
Zee [39]. For an L×L non-Hermitian Hamiltonian matrix H, consider the 2L×2L ‘Hermitized’
matrix

H(z, z∗) =(cid:18) 0
H † − z∗

0 (cid:19) .
H − z

The density of states ρ(z, z∗) of the non-Hermitian matrix H in terms of the variables

z = Re E + i Im E

and

z∗ = Re E − i Im E

is given by [39]

the integrated density of states of the Hermitized matrix H(z, z∗). In other words,

For a large M, the integrated density of states Ω(M; z, z∗) approaches unity, while for a small
ǫ, it approaches 1/2 (because ω(µ; z, z∗) is an even function of µ), losing the dependence on z
and z∗ in both limits. The ﬁrst term in the parentheses of Eq. (33) therefore vanishes after the
derivative ∂∂∗. We thus have

3.2 Method of Hermitization for the inverse localization length

Our strategy is now obvious. We can obtain the Chebyshev-polynomial expansion of the density
of states ρ(z, z∗) by applying the method to the density of states ω(µ; z, z∗) on the real axis of
µ. In fact, we ﬁnd that the Chebyshev-polynomial expansion of the inverse localization length
κ(z, z∗) is easier than that of ρ(z, z∗). We here in the present section describe the former; we
will come back to the latter in Section 4.

In order to ﬁnd the Chebyshev-polynomial expansion of the inverse localization length
κ(z, z∗), we ﬁrst need to express κ(z, z∗) in terms of the density of states ω(µ; z, z∗) of the
Hermitized matrix. The formula that we utilize is the generalized Thouless formula derived by
Derrida et al. [40]:

ρ(z, z∗) =

∂∂∗κ(z, z∗).

Note that its inverse [40]

κ(z, z∗) =

2ZZ dζdζ ∗ρ(ζ, ζ ∗) ln|z − ζ|

(37)

is an equivalent of the original Thouless formula (13). Comparing Eq. (36) with Eq. (35), we
have

κ(z, z∗) = 2Z ∞

0

ω(µ; z, z∗) ln µ dµ + f (z) + g(z∗),

(38)

where f (z) and g(z∗) are arbitrary functions, which we ﬁx hereafter by looking into the limit
of |z| → ∞.
Suppose that the one-dimensional Hamiltonian matrix is given by

For very large values of |z|, we can ﬁnd the inverse localization length κ(z, z∗) as follows.

The eigenvalue equation hx|H|ψi = Ehx|ψi reads

Ehx|ψi = hx|H|ψi

= tx−1,xhx − 1|ψi + tx+1,xhx + 1|ψi + Vxhx|ψi.

We can cast this into the form of the transfer matrix as

we conclude that

κ(E) ≃ ln|E| − ln|t|,

(46)

(47)

where |t| is the geometric mean of |tx−1,x|. This is the behavior of the left-hand side of Eq. (38)
for large values of |z|.
On the other hand, we can ﬁnd the right-hand side of Eq. (38) for large values of |z| as
follows. The Hermitized matrix H(z, z∗) is reduced to
0 (cid:19)
H →(cid:18) 0 −z

−z∗

(48)

for large values of |z|, and hence its eigenvalues are degenerate into µν = ±|z|, which means
(49)

ω(µ; z, z∗) =

1
2

(δ(µ − |z|) + δ(µ + |z|)) .

Therefore, the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of Eq. (38) is reduced to ln|z|, which is the same
as the ﬁrst term of the right-hand side of Eq. (47).
The remaining terms in Eq. (38), f (z) + g(z∗), therefore should converge to the constant
value − ln|t| for large values of |z|. An analytic function in general attains its maximum in
a given domain on the boundary of that domain. Moreover, a bounded analytic function is
necessarily a constant. Since both f (z) and g(z∗) are bounded, they are constants; they cannot
balance each other, since one is holomorphic and the other is anti-holomorphic. In other words,
we can ﬁx the arbitrary functions as

f (z) + g(z∗) = − ln|t|

for all z and z∗.

We therefore arrive at the relation

κ(z, z∗) = 2Z ∞

0

ω(µ; z, z∗) ln µ dµ − ln|t|.

(50)

(51)

Comparing this to Eq. (35), we note that we have gotten rid of the differentiation ∂∂∗ here.
This is the reason why the Chebyshev-polynomial expansion of κ(z, z∗) is easier than that of
ρ(z, z∗).

3.3 Chebyshev-polynomial expansion of the inverse localization length

We are now in a position to ﬁnd the Chebyshev-polynomial expansion of the inverse localization
length κ(z, z∗) by applying the method to the density of states ω(µ; z, z∗) on the real axis of µ.

14

Assume that the density of states of the Hermitized matrix is expanded in the form

(52)

ω(µ; z, z∗) =

p1 − µ2

Xm=0
where we used only the even-order terms because ω(µ; z, z∗) is always an even function of µ
thanks to the symmetry of the Hermitized matrix H.
An important remark is in order here; we can employ the Chebyshev polynomial expansion
only after we properly rescale the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian H in such a way that the support
of the spectrum ω(µ; z, z∗) of the Hermitized matrix H is contained in [−1, 1]. Let us ﬁnd the
proper rescaling factor. Suppose that the sum of the moduli of all elements in a row or a column
of the non-Hermitian matrix H is bounded by a constant Λ, which is the bound of the spectrum
according to the Gershgorin circle theorem. Let us then rescale H by a factor r, so that the
bound is rescaled as Λ/r. It is then enough to scan the spectrum over the range | Re E| ≤ Λ/r
and | Im E| ≤ Λ/r, which means |z| = |z∗| ≤ √2Λ/r. Therefore, the sum of the moduli of all
elements in a row or a column of the Hermitized matrix H(z, z∗) is bounded by (1 + √2)Λ/r
if we scan the spectrum only over the above range. The support of the Chebyshev polynomial
[−1, 1] should contain this bound. We therefore rescale the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian H with
a rescaling factor r that is equal to or greater than (1 +√2)Λ. We assume that the matrix H has
been already normalized throughout this subsection.

Let us come back to Eq. (52) and ﬁnd the expansion coefﬁcients using the orthogonal rela-

tion (4). The coefﬁcients are given by

The trace on the right-hand side of Eq. (53) is recursively generated from

Tn+1(H) = 2HTn(H) − Tn−1(H).

(55)
Let us remember here that we need only the even-order Chebyshev polynomials of H. As
we show in Appendix B, the even-order matrix polynomials T2m(H) have the elements only
on the L × L upper-left and lower-right diagonal blocks, whereas the odd-order ones have the
elements only on the off-diagonal blocks. We also prove in Appendix B that for the even-order
polynomials of H, the trace of the upper-left block is equal to the trace of the lower-right block.
We can therefore reduce the size of the recursion relation (55) to L × L:

where the superscripts (1, 1) and (2, 1) denote the L × L upper-left and lower-left blocks, re-
spectively. We can save the computer memory storage by using these recursion relations and
use

3.4 Demonstration

Let us now demonstrate our new algorithm of the Chebyshev-polynomial expansion (62). We
here use the random-sign model, also known as the Feinberg-Zee random hopping model [41,
42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 23], which is given by

H =

L

Xx=1

(tx|x + 1ihx| + sx|xihx + 1|) ,

(63)

where each of {tx} and {sx} is independently randomly chosen from ±1 with the equal proba-
bility; the periodic boundary conditions are assumed. The spectrum is a fuzzy fractal-like object

one random sample of the random-sign chain (63) of length L = 1000.

as is shown in Fig. 5(a); note the exact reﬂection symmetries with respect to the real and imag-
inary axes as well as the statistical reﬂection symmetries with respect to the 45◦ and 135◦ lines.
The result of our expansion (62) for the inverse localization length is shown in Fig. 5 (c) and (d).
This is basically consistent with the result in Fig. 9 (a) of Ref. [23], where the inverse local-
ization length of the random-sign model (63) was estimated by means of the transfer-matrix
approach as the average of the logarithm of the Ricatti variable hx + 1|ψi/hx|ψi.
Note the smoothness of the result in Fig. 5 (c). We attribute it again to the factor 1/m in the
expansion (62), as we did at the end of Section 2.2 for Hermitian models. We show in Fig. 6
the modulus of the factor 1
2m (H(z, z∗)) in the expansion coefﬁcients. At z = 1 + i,
the factor decays almost exponentially up to the 200th order but ﬂuctuates around 0.01 with a
possible slight decay. The behavior was similar for almost any value of z except for z = 0,
where it regularly decays as shown in Fig. 6 (b). The cutoff error is suppressed thanks to the
factor 1/m in the expansion coefﬁcient.

L Tr T (1,1)

While many studies [41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49] had focused on the fractal-like
spectrum of the random-sign model (63), the study in Ref. [23] found two new features of
the model’s inverse localization length, which we here reproduce by means of our Chebyshev-
polynomial expansion (62). First, the inverse localization length was numerically found to
behave interestingly around E = 0 [23]. We can prove that the inverse localization length
vanishes at E = 0 [23] just as in the random-hopping model (23), but the behavior around
E = 0 [31, 32, 33, 34, 35] seems to be very different from Eq. (25). Numerical data of the
Chebyshev-polynomial expansion in Fig. 7 suggest that the κ(E) is proportional to |E|2 around
E = 0 with the proportional constants depending on the argument ϕ of E = |E|eiϕ. The
linearity with respect to |E|2 seen in Fig. 7 implies a non-singular density of states around
E = 0 according to Derrida’s formula (36), which is indeed consistent with the results in
Ref. [23], where the density of states is shown to be vanishing around E = 0 in a non-singular
way.

The other feature found in Ref. [23] for the random-sign model (63) concerns its asymmetric

extension made in the spirit of the model (22):

L

(64)

H =

Xx=1(cid:0)egtx|x + 1ihx| + e−gsx|xihx + 1|(cid:1) ,

where g is again a real parameter and the periodic boundary conditions are assumed. As we
increase g, a hole appears in the fractal-like spectrum as exempliﬁed in Fig. 5 (b) for g = 0.1.
It was conjectured [23] that the eigenstates that reside on the rim of the hole for g > 0 had the
inverse localization length κ = g for g = 0, as was the case for the model (22). As an example,
the rims of the hole of the spectrum of the model (64) for g = 0.1 (the one in Fig. 5 (b)) and
g = 0.2 are superimposed on the contour plot of κ(E) of the model (63) in Fig. 5 (d). The rims
of the hole fall nicely on to the contours of κ(E) = 0.1 and 0.2, which indeed conﬁrms the
conjecture.

4 Method for the density of states of non-Hermitian matrices

4.1 Chebyshev-polynomial expansion of the density of states

We ﬁnally give the algorithm for the density of states of non-Hermitian matrices. We can apply
the same logic as in Section 3.3 to Eq. (35) instead of Eq. (51). We thus arrive at the expansion

We can generate the factor
differentiating Eq. (55), we have

∂Tn+1(H) = −2(cid:18)0 I
∂∗Tn+1(H) = −2(cid:18)0 0
∂∂∗Tn+1(H) = −2(cid:18)0 0

0 0(cid:19) Tn(H) + 2H∂Tn(H) − ∂Tn−1(H),
I 0(cid:19) Tn(H) + 2H∂∗Tn(H) − ∂∗Tn−1(H),
I 0(cid:19) ∂Tn(H) − 2(cid:18)0 I

0 0(cid:19) ∂∗Tn(H) + 2H∂∂∗Tn(H) − ∂∂∗Tn−1(H).

(67)

(68)

(69)

We can thereby generate the series of ∂Tn(H) and the series of ∂∗Tn(H) with the help of the
series Tn(H), and ﬁnally the series of ∂∂∗Tn(H) with the help of the preceding two series.
We therefore need four matrix multiplications to generate one more element in the series of
∂∂∗Tn(H).
4.2 Demonstration

For demonstration of the expansion (66) for the density of states of non-Hermitian matrices, we
here use an L × L sign random matrix with correlation: for each pair of off-diagonal elements
Hij and Hji, we set both of them equal to ±1 with the probability τ (that is, to +1 with the
probability τ /2 and to −1 with the probability τ /2), but set them independently randomly to
±1 with the probability 1−τ, while setting all diagonal elements to zero. This means a partially
symmetric random matrix with the correlation hHijHjii = τ.

According to Ref. [50] for Gaussian randomness, the density of states forms an ellipse:

ρ(E) =((πab)−1

0

if (x/a)2 + (y/b)2 ≤ 1,
otherwise,

(70)

where a = √L(1 + τ ) and b = √L(1 − τ ). This reduces to the celebrated Wigner semi-circle

law [51] on the real axis in the completely symmetric case, namely τ = 1, and to Girko’s
circle law [52] in the completely asymmetric case, namely, τ = 0. Figure 8 (a) and (b) shows
the results of the diagonalization of 10000 × 10000 sign random matrices with τ = 0 and
τ = 0.5, respectively, which indeed follows the law (70) for Gaussian random matrices. Our

96 samples of (c) the fully asymmetric random matrix (τ = 0) and (d) a partially asymmetric
random matrix (τ = 0.5), both of size 100 × 100, from the results of the expansion (66).

expansion (66), on the other hand, produces Fig. 8 (c) and (d) for 100 × 100 random matrices.
We can see a ridge on the real axis, which is presumably a ﬁnite-size effect.
The expansion (65) for the density of states is a much more time-consuming algorithm
than the diagonalization for relatively small dense matrices, which is the case of the present
demonstration. For large non-Hermitian matrices, on the other hand, it would be almost the
only available algorithm and can be quite efﬁcient for sparse matrices. For large dense matrices,
we might need to replace the trace operation in Eq. (65) with Monte Carlo summation over a
set of basis vectors less than L.

5 Summary

We have found the Chebyshev-polynomial expansion of the energy dependence of the inverse
localization length both for Hermitian and non-Hermitian chains. For Hermitian chains, the
expansion produces the energy dependence as a function in one run. This is in strong contrast
to the standard transfer-matrix method, which produces the inverse localization at a ﬁxed energy
in one run. Since our method is based on the repeated multiplication of the Hamiltonian matrix,
we can execute the algorithm by storing only vectors in principle; we do not need to store the
entire matrix in computer memory. This feature will enable us to generalize the method to
models with interaction. For non-Hermitian chains, the expansion produces only the inverse
localization length at a ﬁxed (complex) energy in one run. Again, we do not need to store the
entire matrix in computer memory.

We have also found the Chebyshev-polynomial expansion of the density of states for non-
Hermitian matrices. The present algorithm may be almost the only available algorithm of ﬁnd-
ing the density of states without storing the entire matrix in computer memory.

C Integration of Equation (61)

We can ﬁnd the integration in Eq. (61) in the following way. Since the Chebyshev polynomial
is expressed in the form Tn(x) = cos(n arccos x), we change the integration variable from x to
θ, where x = cos θ. We have dx = − sin θdθ with the integration region π/2 through 0. We
thus have

I2m =Z π/2

ln cos θ

√1 − cos2 θ

cos(2mθ)

Since sin θ ≥ 0 in the integration region, we can set √1 − cos2 θ to sin θ. We thereby have

I2m =Z π/2

cos(2mθ) ln cos θdθ.

For m > 0, we integrate it by parts to have

that ln cos θ → −∞ as θ → π/2, because (θ − π/2) ln(θ − π/2) → 0 as θ → π/2. We thus
have

D Equations (19) and (62) for Hermitian matrices

We here show that the Chebyshev expansion (62) for non-Hermitian matrices reduces to the
expansion (19) when H is a Hermitian matrix. For the purpose, we ﬁrst introduce summation
formulas for Chebyshev polynomials. We start from the Fourier series

Setting θ = arccos(x − y) in Eq. (104) to use the deﬁnition Tn(x) = cos(n arccos x), we have

= − ln 2|x − y|.

We use the formula (112) to prove that Eq. (62) reduces to Eq. (19) for a Hermitian matrix
H. We here make use of the last form of Eq. (94) for the expansion coefﬁcient in Eq. (62). For
Hermitian matrices, the eigenvalues {Eν} of H are all real. We put z to the real variable E,
because we are interested in κ(E) on the real axis in Eq. (19). We can therefore cast Eq. (62)
into the form

κ(E) = −
