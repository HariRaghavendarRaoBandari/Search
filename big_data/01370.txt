COMPACT OPERATORS ON MODEL SPACES

ISABELLE CHALENDAR AND WILLIAM T. ROSS

Abstract. We give a characterization of the compact operators
on a model space in terms of asymptotic Toeplitz operators.

1. Introduction

If H 2 denotes the classical Hardy space of the open unit disk D [4, 7], a
theorem of Brown and Halmos [3] says that a bounded linear operator
T on H 2 is a Toeplitz operator if and only if

S ∗T S = T,

where Sf = zf is the well-known unilateral shift on H 2. By a Toeplitz
operator [2], we mean, for a given symbol ϕ ∈ L∞(T, m) (T is the unit
circle and m is normalized Lebesgue measure on T), the operator

Tϕ : H 2 → H 2, Tϕf = P (ϕf ),

where P is the orthogonal projection of L2 onto H 2.

This notion of “Toeplitzness” was extended in various ways. Barria
and Halmos [1] examined the so-called asymptotically Toeplitz operators
operators T on H 2 for which the sequence of operators

{S ∗nT Sn}n>1

converges strongly. This class certainly includes the Toeplitz operators
but also includes other operators such as those in the Hankel algebra.
Feintuch [5] discovered that one need not restrict to strong convergence
of {S ∗nT Sn}n>1 and worthwhile classes of operators arise from the weak
and uniform (or norm) limits of this sequence. Indeed, an operator T
on H 2 is uniformly asymptotically Toeplitz, i.e., S ∗nT Sn converges in
operator norm, if and only if

where T1 is a Toeplitz operator, i.e., S ∗T1S = T1, and K is a compact
operator on H 2. Nazarov and Shapiro [8] examined other associated
notions of “Toeplitzness” with regards to certain composition operators
on H 2.

In this paper we explore a model space setting for this “Toeplitzness”
discussion. For an inner function Θ on D (i.e., a bounded analytic
function on D whose radial boundary values are unimodular almost
everywhere on T), one can deﬁne the model space [6, 9]

KΘ = H 2 ⊖ ΘH 2.

Beurling’s theorem [4] says that these spaces are the generic invariant
subspaces for the backward shift operator
f − f (0)

S ∗f =

z

on H 2. By model theory for contractions [9], certain types of Hilbert
space contractions are unitarily equivalent to compressed shifts

where PΘ is the orthogonal projection of L2 onto KΘ.

SΘ = PΘS|KΘ,

In this model spaces setting, we examine, for a bounded operator A on
KΘ, the sequence

{S ∗n

Θ ASn

Θ}n>1.

Here we have a similar result as before (see Lemma 2.6 below) in that
S ∗n
Θ ASn

Θ converges in operator norm if and only if

A = A1 + K,

where K is a compact operator on KΘ and A1 satisﬁes S ∗
ΘA1SΘ = A1.
In the analogous H 2 setting, the operator T1 from (1.1) is a Toeplitz
operator. In the model space setting, the corresponding operator A1 is
severely restricted. Indeed,

A1 ≡ 0.

Thus, as the main theorem of this paper, we have the following char-
acterization of the compact operators on KΘ.

Theorem 1.2. For an inner function Θ and a bounded linear operator
A on KΘ, the following are equivalent:

(i) The sequence S ∗n

Θ ASn

Θ converges in operator norm;

(ii) S ∗n

Θ ASn

Θ → 0 in operator norm;

(iii) A is a compact operator.

One can also explore the convergence of the sequence S ∗n
Θ in other
topologies, such as the strong/weak operator topologies. Surprisingly
what happens is entirely diﬀerent from what happens in H 2.

Θ ASn

Proposition 1.3. For any inner function Θ and any bounded linear
operator A on KΘ, the sequence S ∗n

Θ converges to zero strongly.

Θ ASn

In other words, the convergence of S ∗n
Θ in the strong or weak topol-
ogy is always true (and to the same operator) and provides no infor-
mation about A.

Θ ASn

2. Characterization of the compact operators

The following lemma proves the implication (iii) =⇒ (ii) of Theorem
1.2.

Lemma 2.1. If K is a compact operator on KΘ then

lim
n→∞

kS ∗n

Θ KSn

Θk = 0.

Proof. Let BΘ = {f ∈ KΘ : kf k 6 1} denote the closed unit ball in
KΘ. First observe that

kSn

Θk 6 kSΘkn 6 kPΘS|KΘkn 6 kSkn = 1.

From here we see that

kS ∗n

Θ KSn

kS ∗n

Θ KSn

Θf k

Θk = sup
f ∈BΘ
6 sup
g∈BΘ
6 sup

h∈K(BΘ)

kS ∗n

Θ Kgk

kS ∗n

Θ hk.

(2.2)

Second, note that S ∗n → 0 strongly. Indeed, if f = Pk>0 akzk ∈ H 2,

then

kS ∗nf k2 = Xk>n+1

|ak|2 → 0 n → ∞.

Thus since S ∗n

Θ = S ∗n|KΘ (since KΘ is S ∗-invariant), we see that

(2.3)

S ∗n

Θ → 0 strongly.

Let ǫ > 0 be given and let h ∈ K(BΘ). Since S ∗n
exists an nh,ǫ such that kS ∗n

Θ → 0 strongly, there
Θ hk < ǫ/2 for all n > nh,ǫ. The continuity

4

CHALENDAR AND ROSS

of the operator S ∗nh,ǫ implies that there exists a rh,ǫ such that for all q
belonging to

B(h, rh,ǫ) = {q ∈ KΘ : kq − hk < rh,ǫ}

we have kS ∗nh,ǫqk < ǫ.

Again using the fact that kS ∗
and all n > nh,ǫ we have

Θk 6 1, we see that for all q ∈ B(h, rh,ǫ)

(2.4)

kS ∗n

Θ qk = kS

∗(n−nh,ǫ)
Θ

S

∗nh,ǫ
Θ

qk 6 kS

∗nh,ǫ
Θ

qk < ǫ.

Moreover, we have

K(BΘ) ⊂ [h∈K(BΘ)

B(h, rh,ǫ).

The compactness of K(BΘ) implies that there exists h1, . . . , hN (N =
Nǫ) belonging to K(BΘ) such that

K(BΘ) ⊂

N[k=1

B(hk, rhk,ǫ).

For all n > max{nh1,ǫ, . . . , nhN ,ǫ} we use (2.4) along with (2.2) to see
that

kS ∗n

Θ hk < ǫ ∀h ∈ K(BΘ).

This proves the lemma.

(cid:3)

Remark 2.5. Important to the proof above was the fact that S ∗n
Θ → 0
strongly (see (2.3)). One can show that SΘ is unitarily equivalent to
S ∗
Ψ, where Ψ is the inner function deﬁned by Ψ(z) = Θ(z) [6, p. 303].
From here we see that Sn
Θ → 0 strongly. This detail will be important
at the end of the paper in the proof of Theorem 1.3.

Lemma 2.6. Suppose T is a bounded operator on KΘ such that S ∗n
Θ T Sn
Θ
converges in norm. Then T = T1 + K, where K is a compact operator
on KΘ and T1 is a bounded operator on KΘ satisfying S ∗

ΘT1SΘ = T1.

Proof. Let A be a bounded operator on KΘ such that

kS ∗n

Θ T Sn

Θ − Ak → 0.

Then

kS ∗(n+1)

Θ

This implies that

From here it follows that

S ∗n
Θ T Sn

Θ − A = S ∗n

Θ (T − A)Sn

Deﬁne

and observe that

Pn(T − A)Pn = (T − A)

(2.9)

− Qn(T − A) + Qn(T − A)Qn − (T − A)Qn.

Furthermore by (2.8) we have

kPn(T − A)Pnk = kSn

ΘS ∗n
Θ (T − A)Sn
Θ (T − A)Sn

Θ k

If

kλ(z) =

1 − Θ(λ)Θ(z)

1 − λz

,

λ, z ∈ D,

is the reproducing kernel for KΘ, then [10, p. 497] gives us the well-
known operator identity

SΘS ∗

Θ = I − k0 ⊗ k0.

Iterating the above n times we get

In other words,

ΘS ∗n

Qn = I − Pn =

is a ﬁnite rank operator.

By (2.9) this means that

Fn := −Qn(T − A) + Qn(T − A)Qn − (T − A)Qn

is a ﬁnite rank operator which converges in norm to A − T . Hence
A − T a compact operator and, by (2.7), A satisﬁes S ∗
ΘASΘ = A. (cid:3)

6

CHALENDAR AND ROSS

So far we know from Lemma 2.1 that every compact operator K on
KΘ satisﬁes

lim
n→∞

kS ∗n

Θ KSn

Θk = 0.

Furthermore, from Lemma 2.6 we see that an operator A for which
S ∗n
Θ ASn
Θ converges in operator norm can be written as A = A1 + K
where K is compact and A1 satisﬁes S ∗
ΘA1SΘ = A1. To complete the
proof of Theorem 1.2, we need to show that

S ∗

ΘASΘ = A ⇐⇒ A ≡ 0.

This is done with the following result.

Proposition 2.10. Suppose A is a bounded operator on KΘ. Then
S ∗

ΘASΘ = A if and only if A ≡ 0.

Proof. Recall that

kλ(z) =

1 − Θ(λ)Θ(z)

1 − λz

is the kernel function for KΘ. There is also the “conjugate kernel”

Θ(z) − Θ(λ)

z − λ

ekλ(z) =

which also belongs to KΘ [10, p. 495]. The proof depends on the
following kernel function identities from [10, p. 496]:

SΘekλ = λekλ − Θ(λ)k0,

SΘkλ =

kλ −

k0.

1
λ

1
λ

This gives us

(Aekλ)(z) = hS ∗

ΘASΘekλ, kzi

= hA(λekλ − Θ(λ)k0),
(Aekλ)(z) −

Re-arrange the above identity:

Multiply through by z:

(Aekλ)(z)(1 −
(z − λ)(Aekλ)(z) = −Θ(λ)(Ak0)(z) − λ(Aekλ)(0) + Θ(λ)(Ak0)(0).

(Ak0)(0).

z

COMPACT OPERATORS ON MODEL SPACES

Divide by (z − λ) and re-arrange:

(2.11)

(Aekλ)(z) = −Θ(λ)(cid:18)(Ak0)(z) − (Ak0)(λ)

z − λ

(cid:19) − λ

(Aekλ)(0)

z − λ

.

Observe that the functions

z − λ
belong to KΘ for all λ ∈ D. This means that

(Aekλ)(z) and

(Ak0)(z) − (Ak0)(λ)

λ

(Aekλ)(0)

z − λ

must also belong to KΘ for all λ ∈ D which means (since there is an
obvious pole at z = λ) that

The identity in (2.11) can now be written as

(Aekλ)(0) = 0.

(2.12)

(2.13)

Plug in z = 0 into the previous identity and use (2.12) to see that

(Aekλ)(z) = −Θ(λ)(cid:18)(Ak0)(z) − (Ak0)(λ)
0 = (Aekλ)(0) =

((Ak0)(0) − (Ak0)(λ)),

z − λ

Θ(λ)

λ

(cid:19) .

λ ∈ D.

Since Θ is not the zero function, we get

(2.14)

(Ak0)(λ) = (Ak0)(0),

λ ∈ D.

Plus this into (2.13) to get that

Aekλ = 0 ∀λ ∈ D.

But since the linear span of these conjugate kernels form a dense subset

in KΘ (the conjugation operator f 7→ ef is isometric and involutive [10,

p. 495]), we see that A must be the zero operator.

(cid:3)

Proof of Proposition 1.3. For any f, g, ∈ KΘ and n > 0 we have
Θgk.

|hS ∗nASnf, gi| = |hSn

Θgi| 6 kSn

Θf kkA∗Sn

Θf, A∗Sn

(2.15)

Taking the supremum in (2.15) over g ∈ KΘ with kgk 6 1, and using
the fact that kSΘk 6 1, we get

(2.16)

kS ∗nASnf k 6 kSn

Θf kkA∗k.

From Remark 2.5, we conclude that the right hand side of (2.15) goes
to zero as n → ∞. Thus S ∗n
(cid:3)

Θ → 0 strongly.
