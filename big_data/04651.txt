We consider the dissipative single-qubit circuit QED architecture in which the atomic transition
frequency undergoes a weak external time-modulation. For sinusoidal modulation with linearly
varying frequency we derive eﬀective Hamiltonians that resemble the Landau-Zener problem of ﬁ-
nite duration associated to a two- or multi-level systems. The corresponding oﬀ-diagonal coupling
coeﬃcients originate either from the rotating or the counter-rotating terms in the Rabi Hamiltonian,
depending on the values of the modulation frequency. It is demonstrated that in the dissipation-
less case one can accomplish almost complete transitions between the eigenstates of the bare Rabi
Hamiltonian even for relatively short duration of the frequency sweep. To assess the experimental
feasibility of our scheme we solved numerically the phenomenological and the microscopic quantum
master equations in the Markovian regime at zero temperature. Both models exhibit qualitatively
similar behavior and indicate that photon generation from vacuum via eﬀective Landau-Zener tran-
sitions could be implemented with the current technology on the timescales of a few microseconds.
Moreover, unlike the harmonic dynamical Casimir eﬀect implementations, our proposal does not re-
quire the precise knowledge of the resonant modulation frequency to accomplish meaningful photon
generation.

INTRODUCTION

The area of circuit Quantum Electrodynamics (circuit
QED) oﬀers unprecedented possibilities to manipulate
in situ the properties of mesoscopic systems composed
of superconducting artiﬁcial atoms interacting with the
Electromagnetic ﬁeld inside the waveguide resonator on a
chip [1–3]. Along with practical application for Quantum
Information Processing (QIP) this solid-state architec-
ture also allows for the experimental study of some of the
most fundamental physical processes, such as the light–
matter interaction at the level of a few photons. Due to
the relative ease to achieve the strong coupling regime, in
which the coherent light–matter coupling rate is much
larger than the system damping and dephasing rates
[1, 4], this setup can probe novel phenomena with tiny
coupling rates. One example is the implementation of the
dynamical Casimir eﬀect (DCE) and associated phenom-
ena using actively controlled artiﬁcial atoms, which may
serve both as the source and the detector of modulation-
induced radiation [5–11]. We recall that DCE is a com-
mon name ascribed to the processes in which photons
are generated from vacuum due to the external time-
variation of boundary conditions for some ﬁeld [12–15].
For the usual Electromagnetic case this corresponds to
the fast motion of a mirror or modulation of the dielec-
tric properties of the mirror / intracavity medium [16].
Analogs of DCE were recently veriﬁed experimentally in
the setups resembling a single-mirror [17] and a lossy

cavity [18], where the modulation of the boundary condi-
tions was achieved by threading a time-dependent mag-
netic ﬂux through SQUIDs (superconductive quantum
interference devices) located inside the coplanar waveg-
uide. These experiments stimulated new theoretical re-
search on role of dynamical Casimir physics in quantum-
information processing, quantum simulations and engi-
neering of nonclassical states of light and matter [19–24].
Recent studies have indicated that DCE could be im-
plemented even using a single two-level atom (qubit) with
time-dependent parameters, such as the transition fre-
quency or the atom–ﬁeld coupling strength [5, 25–28].
Generation of excitation from vacuum occurs due to the
counter-rotating terms in the Rabi Hamiltonian, which
for many years had been neglected under the Rotat-
ing Wave Approximation (RWA). Moreover, single-atom
DCE carries some new characteristics, such as the atom–
ﬁeld entanglement, saturation in the number of created
photons (due to intrinsic nonlinearities associated with
non-harmonic spectrum of the composite system) and
emergence of additional resonant modulation frequencies
[27]. Since the ultra-strong coupling regime [29–32] (for
which the atom–ﬁeld coupling rate is comparable to the
cavity and atomic frequencies) is experimentally demand-
ing, especially in nonstationary conﬁgurations, here we
assume moderate values of the coupling strength, which
in turn imply small transition rates for the phenomena
originating from the counter-rotating terms. Hence the
dissipation must be suﬃciently weak and the frequency
of modulation must be tuned with a high precision, typi-

cally of the order of 10 −100 kHz for modulation frequen-
cies in the GHz range, that ultimately should be deter-
mined experimentally or numerically. For the harmonic
modulation of system parameters the observable quan-
tities, e. g., the average photon number or the atomic
excitation probability, exhibit a oscillating behavior as
function of time [5, 28]. Therefore the duration of mod-
ulation must also be minutely adjusted to grasp a mean-
ingful amount of excitations, since the detection is typi-
cally carried out when the modulation has ceased.

In this paper we propose a simple scheme to implement
the phenomena induced by the counter-rotating terms
that does not require an accurate knowledge of the reso-
nance frequencies and is little sensitive to the duration of
the perturbation. Our method is based on the adiabatic
variation of the modulation frequency of the atomic level
splitting through the expected resonance, when one can
steadily create excitations from vacuum and other initial
states without the aforementioned sporadic comebacks of
the system to the initial state. This phenomenon can be
understood in terms of some eﬀective two- or multi-level
Hamiltonians with constant nondiagonal couplings, de-
pendent on the modulation depths, and time-dependent
diagonal terms, which are responsible for Landau-Zener
processes.

By the way, Landau-Zener transitions [33–36] are a
very fundamental phenomenon, since they occur every
time a two-level system is subjected to a time-dependent
Hamiltonian whose bare energies change with time and
cross at some instant of time. In its original form, LZ
model is characterized by bare energies changing lin-
early in time. Over the years, the original scheme has
been extended in several directions: non linear time-
dependence of the diagonal matrix elements of the Hamil-
tonian [37, 38], multilevel systems, even with n-fold cross-
ings [39, 40], and, of course, including environmental ef-
fects inducing dissipation and decoherence [41–44]. This
ubiquitous model has been applied to describe similar
dynamical situations in several physical scenarios. For
example, it has been useful in such systems as spino-
rial Bose-Einstein condensates [45], Josephson junctions
[46, 47],
in optical lattices with cold atoms [48], and
even — in its modiﬁed version know as ‘Hidden Crossing
model’ [49] — in classical optics [50]. Also in the context
of Circuit QED, Landau-Zener tunneling has been exten-
sively used to suitably manipulate the state of a single
qubit [41, 51, 52]. In our case, Landau-Zener processes
naturally rise from the fact that the frequency sweep al-
lows realizing a series of resonances between the (time-
varying frequency) external perturbation and a series of
couples of the Rabi-Hamiltonian eigenstates.

One possible downside of our method is the relatively
long implementation times. Nonetheless, we demonstrate
that it can work with the current dissipative parameters
provided the modulation depth of the atomic transition
frequency is of the order of a few percent of its bare value.
Besides, we show that the states generated from vacuum
can be quite diﬀerent from the squeezed vacuum state

2

(SVS) that is typically generated for strictly harmonic
modulations [16, 53], so our scheme may ﬁnd new appli-
cations in QIP.

This paper is organized as follows.

In section II we
deduce the eﬀective Hamiltonians similar to the Landau-
Zener physics in the resonant and dispersive regimes of
atom–ﬁeld interaction.
In section III we describe our
approach to realistically account for the dissipation, with
thorough numerical analysis carried out in section IV.
Finally, in section V we discuss the obtained results and
present our conclusions.

II. EFFECTIVE LANDAU-ZENER SWEEPS

We consider a single qubit in nonstationary circuit
QED. Our starting point is the Hamiltonian (we set
 = 1)

(cid:0)ˆa + ˆa†(cid:1) (ˆσ+ + ˆσ−) ,

(1)

ˆHR(t) = ω0 ˆn +

Ω(t)

2

ˆσz + g0

where ˆa and ˆa† are cavity annihilation and creation op-
erators and ˆn = ˆa†ˆa is the photon number operator;
ˆσ+ = |e(cid:105)(cid:104)g|, ˆσ− = |g(cid:105)(cid:104)e| and ˆσz = |e(cid:105)(cid:104)e| − |g(cid:105)(cid:104)g| are
the atomic ladder operators, where |g(cid:105) (|e(cid:105)) denotes the
atomic ground (excited) state. ω0 is the cavity frequency,
Ω is the atomic transition frequency and g0 is the atom–
ﬁeld coupling strength. For the sake of simplicity here we
consider the external modulation of the atomic transition
frequency as Ω(t) = Ω0 + εΩ sin[η(t)t + φΩ], although it
was shown that for g0 (cid:28) ω0, Ω0 the weak modulation of
any system parameter produces similar results. In this
work we suppose that the modulation frequency η(t) may
also slowly change as function of time. It will be shown
that in speciﬁc regimes we obtain the two-level or multi-
level eﬀective Landau-Zener physics, so initially unpop-
ulated system states can be excited without undergoing
oscillations back to the initial state.
For εΩ (cid:28) Ω0 and εΩ (cid:46) g0 we can treat the external
modulation as a perturbation that drives the transitions
between the bare eigenstates of the Rabi Hamiltonian,
R |Ri(cid:105) = Ei|Ri(cid:105), where
ˆH (0)

(cid:0)ˆa + ˆa†(cid:1) (ˆσ+ + ˆσ−)

(2)

and Ei increases with the index i. Expanding the wave-
function corresponding to the Hamiltonian (1) as

(cid:88)

i

(cid:88)

|ψ(t)(cid:105) =

Ai(t)e−itEi|Ri(cid:105)

(3)

the probability amplitudes obey the coupled diﬀerential
equations

i ˙Aj(t) =

εΩ sin (ηt + φΩ)

2

i

Ai(t)e−it(Ei−Ej )(cid:104)Rj|ˆσz|Ri(cid:105).

(4)

Thus one can induce the coherent coupling between the
Rabi dressed states {|Ri(cid:105),|Rj(cid:105)} by setting the modula-
tion frequency roughly equal to |Ei− Ej|. The remaining
rapidly oscillating terms can be neglected according to
the RWA approach, which sets the criteria for the valid-
ity of the resulting eﬀective equations. In addition, the
RWA method introduces small intrinsic frequency shifts
in the ﬁnal equations, which slightly alter the resonant
modulation frequency [26, 27]. One of the advantages of
the present scheme is that such frequency shifts are com-
pletely irrelevant for the experimental implementation.
For the weak qubit–ﬁeld coupling considered here,
g0 (cid:28) ω0, we can ﬁnd the approximate spectrum of the
Rabi Hamiltonian by performing the unitary transforma-
tion [54]

ˆUR = exp(cid:2)Λ(cid:0)ˆaˆσ− − ˆa† ˆσ+

(cid:1) + ξ(cid:0)ˆa2 − ˆa†2(cid:1) ˆσz

(5)
where Λ ≡ g0/∆+, ξ ≡ Λg0/2ω0 and ∆± = ω0 ± Ω0.
To the ﬁrst order in Λ we get the Bloch-Siegert Hamilto-
nian [? ]

The approximate eigenstates of (2) are |Ri(cid:105) = ˆUR|Υi(cid:105),
where |Υi(cid:105) are the eigenstates of ˆHBS:

Contrary to the standard studies on DCE and related
resonant eﬀects, where the precise knowledge of spec-
trum is necessary to accomplish the desired transitions
[25, 27, 28, 55], in this work only an approximate knowl-
edge of the spectrum is enough to achieve the phenom-
ena of interest. Therefore the lowest order eigenvalues
and eigenstates derived above are suﬃcient for our pur-
poses. The essence of our proposal is most clearly seen in
speciﬁc regimes of the system parameters, as illustrated
below for the resonant and dispersive regimes.

A. Resonant regime

First we consider the resonant regime, ∆− = 0, and
assume a small number of excitations, Λ2n (cid:28) 1. For
the initial system ground state |R0(cid:105) and the modulation
frequency

η = 2ω0 ± g0

one can show [by neglecting the rapidly oscillating terms
in equation (4)] that to the lowest order in Λ the dynam-
ics is described by the eﬀective Hamiltonian

Notice that this Hamiltonian only holds for the modula-

of the counter-rotating terms in the Rabi Hamiltonian
(2).

such transition is 1 − exp(cid:0)−πβ2/| ˙ν|(cid:1), which is close to

When ν (t) is a linear function of time the equation
(16) describes the standard two-level Landau-Zener prob-
lem, so for adiabatic variation of V (t) across the avoided-
crossing one can transfer steadily the population from
the initial state |R0(cid:105) to the ﬁnal one |R2,±(cid:105). For the lin-
ear variation of V (t) from −∞ to +∞ the probability of
one provided we have | ˙ν| (cid:28) πβ2. However, the equation
(16) is only valid for small values of |ν|, so our scheme
corresponds to the ﬁnite duration Landau-Zener sweeps
in which we have |ν(t)| ≤ K|β|, where K is of the order
of 10. Nonetheless, as shown later, in this way we can
achieve the desired transition with suﬃciently high prob-
ability and compensate for the ignorance in the knowl-
edge of the exact eigenvalues of the system Hamiltonian.

B. Dispersive regime

The dispersive regime is deﬁned as g0

n (cid:28) |∆−| /2 for
all relevant values of n, and we also assume the standard
condition |∆−| (cid:28) ω0. Repeating the above reasoning one
ﬁnds that for the initial ground state and the modulation

where D = ±, being the sign of ∆−/|∆−|. Thus one
can achieve the steady population transfer from |R0(cid:105) to
|R2,−D(cid:105), which corresponds approximately to the tran-
sition |g, 0(cid:105) → |e, 1(cid:105). For ν(t) = 0 this behavior was
previously named Anti-Jaynes-Cummings regime [5, 6]
or the blue-sideband transition [54].

On the other hand, for

η = 2ω0 + 2 (δ− − δ+) − 4α − ν(t)

(21)

we obtain an analog of the DCE Hamiltonian in the pres-
ence of the Kerr nonlinearity [27]

|β| (cid:38) |α| we get the ‘multi-level’ Landau-Zener prob-
in which one can couple several dressed states
lem,
|R2n,D(cid:105) ≈ |g, 2n(cid:105) at each avoided-crossing (although the
avoided crossings for diﬀerent pairs of levels do not co-
incide exactly), so one can asymptotically create several
photons from the initial vacuum state |g, 0(cid:105).

Our approach is not limited to the initial ground state.
For example, for the initial state with a ﬁnite number of
excitations one can apply the low modulation frequency

η = |∆− − 2δ+m| + 2|δ−| m − 2|α| m2 − ν(t) .

in the Hamiltonian (25) rely only on the rotating terms
in the Rabi Hamiltonian, so the parameter Λ does not
m (cid:28) g0
appear in the coupling coeﬃcient β. For εΩ
and |ν|max (cid:46) 10|β| we achieve the coupling only between
the states {|Rm,D(cid:105),|Rm,−D(cid:105)}, that corresponds approxi-
mately to the steady transition |g, m(cid:105) → |e, m − 1(cid:105). For
larger variations of |ν| several dressed states may become
successively coupled during the frequency sweep.

III. ACCOUNT OF DISSIPATION

For open quantum systems the dynamics must be de-
scribed by the master equation (ME) for the system den-
sity operator

dˆρ/dt = −i[ ˆHR(t), ˆρ] + ˆLˆρ,

(27)
where ˆL is the Liouvillian superoperator whose form de-
pends on the details of system-reservoir interaction. In
this work we do not aim to develop a microscopic ab initio
model for dissipation in nonstationary systems, instead
we assess whether the eﬀective Landau-Zener transitions
discussed in the previous section could be implemented
in real circuit QED architectures. So we use the simplest
consistent dissipation approaches available in the liter-
ature to evaluate numerically the dynamics during the
timescales of interest.

We consider independent reservoirs for diﬀerent pro-
cesses, such as dissipation and pure dephasing. Moreover,
we assume that their correlation times are much shorter
than the system relevant timescales, virtually zero, so
that we can treat the noise in the Markovian limit. Ap-
plying the Davies-Spohn theory [56], we can consider that
in a given time window the bath sees the system as if it
was governed by a time-independent Hamiltonian, and if
such time window is larger than the typical correlation
time of the bath, then the bath acts on the system as if it
was governed by a time-independent Hamiltonian, time
interval after time interval. If the transition frequencies
of the system are all diﬀerent for any pair of eigenstates
of ˆHR(t), which is true for the examples discussed below,

then at zero temperature the master equation reads [54]

as ˆLR may be important for future studies where the
numerical evaluation of ˆLR or ˆLJC is prohibitively com-
plicated.

From the lowest order approximate expressions for the
eigenvalues and the eigenstates [consider equations (7)
– (12)], we see that for εΩ (cid:28) max{g0, ∆−} the time-
dependent eigenvalues and eigenstates are very close to
the time-independent ones evaluated at the bare qubit
frequency Ω0. In this work we assume a small modula-
tion depth and g0 (cid:28) ω0, Ω0, hence in the ME (28) we can
use the lowest order time-independent Rabi eigenvalues
and eigenstates given by equations (7) – (12) [? ]. More-
over, we do not restrict our analysis to a speciﬁc model
for the reservoirs’ spectral densities and make the sim-
plest assumption that the dissipation rates are zero for
 < 0 and take on constant values κ, γ and γφ for  ≥ 0.
Since our primary goal is to study the photon generation
from vacuum, such assumption is the most conservative
with regards to the spurious generation of excitations due
to dephasing [54, 57, 58]. Besides, eventual random ﬂuc-
tuations in the modulation frequency may be treated as
additional dephasing noise [54, 57], so the simultaneous
inclusion of κ, γ and γφ covers the most common exper-
imental situations.
The numeric integration of the master equation (28)
with the approximate Rabi eigenstates |Ri(cid:105) is still cum-
bersome from the practical viewpoint, so we also evaluate

Jaynes-Cummings eigenvalues and eigenstates obtained
by setting δ+ = Λ = ξ = 0 in equations (7) - (12). It
will be shown that in our examples, where Λ ≈ 0.02,
these two approaches give almost indistinguishable re-
sults, which are qualitatively similar to the prediction
of the phenomenological ‘standard master equation’ of

We veriﬁed the feasibility of photon generation from
vacuum via Landau-Zener sweeps of the modulation fre-
quency in actual circuit QED setups by solving numer-
ically the master equation (27) for the kernels ˆLR, ˆLJC
and ˆLph. We considered the standard value ω0/2π =
8 GHz for the cavity frequency, the realistic qubit–ﬁeld
coupling strength g0/ω0 = 4 × 10−2 and the currently
available dissipative rates κ = 10−4g0, γ = γφ = 7 ×
10−4g0 [60–62].

lines correspond to the unitary evolutions, while red, blue and
green lines correspond to the three dissipative models char-
acterized by Lph,LJC ,LR, respectively. The three dissipative
models give almost the same results. The inset in (a) displays
the photon statistics at the time instant βt = 10 under the
dissipative kernel LR.

In ﬁgure 1 we exemplify the implementation of the
transition |g, 0(cid:105) → |R2,+(cid:105) in the resonant regime for
the parameters: ∆− = 0, εΩ = 0.01 × Ω0, η =
√
2 − ν(t), where ν(t) = −8β + (β2/2)t and
√
2ω0 + g0
β ≡ g0εΩ/(2
2∆+). We plot the average photon number
(cid:104)ˆn(cid:105), the Mandel’s Q-factor Q = [(cid:104)(∆ˆn)2(cid:105)−(cid:104)ˆn(cid:105)]/(cid:104)ˆn(cid:105) (that
quantiﬁes the spread of the photon number distribution)
and the atomic excitation probability Pe = Tr[|e(cid:105)(cid:104)e|ˆρ]. In
the ideal case the system ends up approximately in the
dressed state |R2,+(cid:105). Under realistic conditions the pho-
ton generation from vacuum persists for initial times, but
later the system decays to the ground state associated to
the kernel ˆL because the external modulation goes oﬀ-
resonance. We notice that the predictions of diﬀerent
dissipation models are quite similar in this example, so
for a estimative of the time behavior one can employ the
simplest phenomenological master equation. In the inset
we show the photon statistics evaluated at the time in-
terval βt = 10 for the dissipator LR, which conﬁrms that
one or two photons could be measured with roughly 70 %
probability.
In ﬁgure 2 we consider the transition |g, 0(cid:105) → |R2,−D(cid:105)
in dispersive regime for the parameters: ∆− = 9g0,
εΩ = 0.04× Ω0, η = ∆+ − 2 (δ− − δ+) + 4α− ν(t), where
ν(t) = −8β + (β2/2)t and β ≡ g0εΩ/2∆+. Under the
unitary evolution one would generate approximately the
state |e, 1(cid:105), but the dissipation alters dramatically such
behavior due to successive couplings |R1,D(cid:105) → |R3,−D(cid:105),
|R2,D(cid:105) → |R4,−D(cid:105) (roughly |g, 1(cid:105) → |e, 2(cid:105) and |g, 2(cid:105) →
|e, 3(cid:105)) induced by the modulation for large times, while
the transitions |R2,−D(cid:105) → |R1,D(cid:105) and |R3,−D(cid:105) → |R2,D(cid:105)
are caused by dissipation. These additional transitions
are testiﬁed by plotting the behavior of probabilities
Pe,n ≡ Tr[|e, n(cid:105)(cid:104)e, n|ˆρ] obtained from the kernel LJC (ﬁg-
ure 2a); they can be avoided by sweeping the modulation
frequency in the opposite direction, ν(t) → −ν(t), since
in this case the transition |R1,D(cid:105) → |R3,−D(cid:105) becomes
oﬀ-resonant for larger times. In the inset of 2c we show
the photon statistics obtained from the kernel LJC for
the time instant βt = 32, which proves that two photons
could be observed experimentally. Again we notice that
the predictions of the kernels LJC and LR are almost
indistinguishable, and qualitatively identical to the pre-
dictions of Lph. So in the remaining of the paper we shall
only employ the dissipators ˆLJC and ˆLph, as the evalu-
ation of ˆLR becomes too demanding for a large number
of excitations.
In ﬁgures 3 – 4 we consider multiple transitions |g, 0(cid:105) →
|R2k,D(cid:105) (k = 1, 2, . . .) in dispersive regime for the pa-
rameters of ﬁgure 2 and the modulation frequency η =
2ω0+2 (δ− − δ+)−4α−Sν(t), where ν(t) = [8β−(β2/2)t],
√
S = ± and β ≡ δ−εΩ/
2∆+. For these parameters we
have β/α ≈ 0.9, so from the Hamiltonian (22) we expect
Landau-Zener transitions among several dressed states
during each avoided-crossing. In ﬁgure 3 we set S = +,
so only the states |R2k,D(cid:105) with k ∼ 1 may become popu-
lated from the initial vacuum state, as can be seen from
the plots.
In the ideal case the atom acquires a small

sive regime and modulation frequency η = ∆+−2 (δ− − δ+)+

ities Pe,n ≡ Tr(|e, n(cid:105)(cid:104)e, n|ˆρ) (a) and the photon statistics for

probability of excitation and up to six photons are cre-
ated with non-negligible probability – this is shown in the
inset of 3b, where the photon statistics is displayed for
the time instant βt = 25. Besides, the created ﬁeld state
is nonclassical and quite diﬀerent from the usual squeezed
vacuum state created during standard DCE, as corrobo-
rated by the negative values of the Q-factor (recall that
for the SVS one has Q = 1 + 2(cid:104)ˆn(cid:105)). In the presence of
dissipation the system tends to the ground state for large
times, since the modulation becomes oﬀ-resonant. Still
it is possible to measure a meaningful average photon
number (cid:104)ˆn(cid:105) ∼ 2 on the timescales of a few microseconds.
When S = − one can generate a quite large amount of
photons from vacuum in the ideal case, since the system
undergoes successive Landau-Zener transitions towards
the higher-energy dressed states. This is illustrated in
ﬁgure 4. For adiabatic variation of η only a few pho-
ton states are populated at a time (see 4c for the photon
statistics at the time instants βt = 15 and 30), which is
reﬂected in the sub-Poissonian photon statistics for large

times. The amount of created photons can substantially
exceed the average photon number achievable for the har-
monic modulation with constant frequency [27, 28] (green
lines in 4a and 4b, for which η was found numerically to
optimize the photon generation). Our numerical sim-
ulation of dissipation is not accurate for large photon
numbers, so we only show the dissipative dynamics for
βt < 21. The diﬀerences between the predictions of ker-
nels LJC and Lph become signiﬁcant for (cid:104)ˆn(cid:105) (cid:38) 4 due
to the diﬀerences in the available decay channels, but
the overall behavior is qualitatively similar. Our results
demonstrate that several photons can be generated on
the timescales of a few microseconds, but the dissipation
modiﬁes the photon statistics to super-Poissonian (see
the inset in 4a, evaluated at the time instant βt = 10 for
the kernel LJC).
Finally, in ﬁgure 5 we study the transitions between the
dressed states |Rn,+(cid:105) → |Rn,−(cid:105) in the dispersive regime
for n ≤ M , which roughly correspond to the transitions
|g, n(cid:105) → |e, n − 1(cid:105). We consider the initial state |g, α(cid:105),
where |α(cid:105) denotes the coherent state with α =
4.5.
Other parameters are: ∆− = 10g0, εΩ/ω0 = 4×10−3, η =

M = 4 and β ≡ g0εΩ/∆−. As expected, the dissipation
strongly aﬀects the dynamics, since excitations are lost
to the environment from the very beginning and the slow
modulation is unable to create additional excitations. To
conﬁrm the selective Landau-Zener sweeps between the
states {|Rn,+(cid:105),|Rn,−(cid:105)} in 5c and 5d we show the time
evolution of the probabilities Pg,n ≡ Tr(|g, n(cid:105)(cid:104)g, n|ˆρ),
which change one at a time from the initial value to
roughly zero (Pg,n also undergoes fast oscillations due to
the dispersive exchange of excitations between the ﬁeld
and the qubit). For n > M the probabilities Pg,n are
not aﬀected by the perturbation, since the correspond-
ing avoided-crossings are not swept during the frequency
variation (for the frequency change in the opposite di-
rections, ν(t) → −ν(t), only the states with n ≥ M
would be aﬀected). Although under dissipation the oc-
currence of the Landau-Zener transitions is almost com-

tem nor accurately adjusting the shape of the modulation
frequency. Besides, it is only little sensitive to the dura-
tion of the external perturbation. The latter property is
related to the fact that, provided the diabatic energies
(i.e., the diagonal Rabi-basis matrix elements) in the ef-
fective Hamiltonians vary in a suﬃciently wide range and
with a suﬃciently low speed, each Landau-Zener process
essentially leads to the same ﬁnal result, irrespectively of
the speciﬁc range and speed.

It is worth noting that although we considered the
modulation of the atomic transition frequency, our
method can easily be extended to the time-variation of
the atom-ﬁeld coupling strength, or both. Moreover, the
eﬀective Hamiltonians deduced here are valid for arbi-
trary variation of the modulation frequency. So our re-
sults can be employed to propose protocols that optimize,
for instance, the photon production or generation of spe-
ciﬁc entangled states, although in these cases one would
need a precise knowledge of the system spectrum and to
control accurately the duration of the perturbation.

We showed that the eﬀective Landau-Zener transitions
could be implemented for current parameters of dissipa-
tion provided one maintains the modulation for a time in-
terval of the order of microseconds with relative modula-
tion strength of a few percent. For consistent description
of the experimental results the dissipation must be neces-
sarily included because it alters signiﬁcantly the unitary
behavior due to the additional transitions between the
system eigenstates induced by the combined action of dis-
sipation and coherent perturbation. It is remarkable that
the predictions of the phenomenological quantum optical
master equation are qualitatively similar to the predic-
tions of the microscopic dressed-picture master equation,
and in many situations both predictions are almost indis-
tinguishable (this is typical in the weak damping limit).
This means that one can use the simpler phenomenolog-
ical master equation to get a crude estimation about the
overall behavior. The eﬀect of random ﬂuctuations of
the modulation frequency can be incorporated into our
approach as additional pure dephasing, so one does not
expect major qualitative diﬀerences in this case. There-
fore we hope that our protocol will facilitate the hitherto
missing experimental observation of DCE due to a single
qubit.

V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

In this work we have discussed a simple scheme to
achieve photon generation from vacuum due to the
counter-rotating terms in a time-dependent Rabi Hamil-
tonian, where a suitable perturbation characterized by a
sinusoidal time dependence with a slowly changing fre-
quency is present. Because of this frequency change
the perturbation intercepts several resonance frequen-
cies of the system (described by the time-independent
Rabi Hamiltonian) and can induce a single or a series
of Landau-Zener processes that allow for populating the
upper levels starting from the ground state. This scheme
then works quite well without the need to know accu-
rately the resonant unperturbed frequencies of the sys-
