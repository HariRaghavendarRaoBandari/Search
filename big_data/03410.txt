In semiconductor nanostructures nonradiative Auger recombination is enhanced by the presence
of boundaries which relax the momentum conservation and thereby removes the threshold reduction
for these processes. We propose a method to strongly reduce the Auger recombination rate by
injecting spin-polarized carriers. Our method is illustrated on the example of a quantum well in
which the spin-orbit coupling of conduction band is negligible as compared to valence band and thus
holes can be considered as spin-unpolarized. The suppression factor of the Auger recombination is
determined by the two-dimensional character of the system, given by the ratio of the Fermi energy of
electrons and the separation of the electron levels quantized in the growth direction. Our predictions
can be tested experimentally and we discuss their implications for semiconductor lasers relying on
injection of spin-polarized electrons.

PACS numbers:

Auger recombination (AR) is the dominant nonradia-
tive process in many semiconductors.1,2 It is recognized
for its limiting role in the performance, not just of lasers,
light-emitting diodes, and solar cells, but also of transis-
tors and other devices whose performance is governed by
lifetimes.1 In a simple picture, AR rate is cubic in a car-
rier density, unlike the quadratic dependence of the radia-
tive recombination rate. These trends already suggest an
increased role of the AR with heavy doping and scaling-
down of devices. However, even more drastic changes
result when bulk semiconductors are replaced by their
nanostructures.

In the AR, the recombination energy of an electron-
hole pair is transferred to a third carrier, for example, an
electron, as depicted in Fig. 1. In bulk semiconductors
the AR is strongly suppressed at low temperatures. The
simultaneous conservation of the energy and momenta
of colliding particles leads to a large energy threshold.1
However, in quantum wells, the quantum conﬁnement
removes the momentum conservation along the quanti-
zation direction. Colliding particles can exchange their
momenta with the boundaries of the conﬁnement and the
AR becomes thresholdless.3–5

The resulting strong enhancement of AR is not lim-
ited to quantum wells (QWs), but ubiquitous in many
other nanostructures. For example, in colloidal quantum
dots (QDs), AR is attributed to intermittent ﬂourescence
(blinking), permanent photobleaching, and multiexciton
decay.6,7 Consequently, there is a great interest to over-
come this problem and suppress the AR rate in semicon-
ductor nanostructures. For example, using strain was
considered for AR suppression in QWs (with contradic-
tory results),8–10 while in colloidal QDs it was suggested
that smoothing the conﬁnement potential could signiﬁ-
cantly reduce the AR rate, as compared to abruptly ter-
minated boundaries.11

In this work we focus on QWs and propose a diﬀer-
ent mechanism for the suppression of the AR rate which
relies on injecting the spin-polarized carriers. Consid-
ering that such a spin injection is one of the key ele-

ments for spintronic devices and many spin-dependent
phenomena,12–15 it would be important to understand
the role of carrier spin polarization on AR.

With experimental advances in semiconductors spin-
laser which rely on injected spin-polarized carriers,16–25
the suggested AR suppression may extend the limits
of what is feasible in conventional (spin-unpolarized)
lasers. For example, in such spin-lasers a steady-state
lasing threshold reduction17,18,26,27and spin-ﬁltering,22
could also be accompanied with the improved dynami-
cal performance in the modulation bandwidth, switch-
ing properties, and eye diagrams,28 suitable for high-
performance optical interconnects.29

We consider a usually dominant AR in QWs,4 denoted
by CCCH in a conventional notation:1 a recombination of
an electron (1) with a heavy hole (2) is accompanied by
an excitation of another electron (3) to the ﬁnal state (4),

see Fig. 1. We assume, as it is typically the case, that
the heavy hole mass is much bigger than the mass of the
light hole. As a result, the heavy holes density is much
bigger than that of the light ones and the electron-heavy
hole recombination dominates.
In the initial state the
carriers are conﬁned within the QW, their momenta are
being deﬁned by the temperature or the Fermi energy,
while the Auger electron (4) is ejected out of the QW
with a large momentum directed almost perpendicular to
the QW plane. Due to the presence of the heterobound-
aries the momentum is not conserved, the characteristic
of the thresholdless processes. This non-conservation of
the carriers’ momenta makes the AR in heterostructures
so important and detrimental for lasers and other devices.
In our analysis we focus on the spin-polarized electrons,

described by the electron density spin polarization,

Pn =

n↑ − n↓
n↑ + n↓

,

(1)

where the total two-dimensional (2D) electron density,
n, is the sum of the spin-up and spin-down contribu-
tions, n = n↑ + n↓, while the holes are considered spin-
unpolarized. This is readily realized experimentally by
electrical spin injection of electrons, or an optical injec-
tion by circularly polarized light in which the holes loose
their spin polarization nearly instantaneously (for exam-
ple, 3-4 orders of magnitude faster than electrons in GaAs
at room temperature), as a consequence of much stronger
spin-orbit coupling in the valence band.12,14 Equivalently,
we expect that the hole spin-relaxation time is shorter
than the AR time. Assuming spin-unpolarized holes is
also widely used in the studies of spin-lasers.17–19,26,27

Formally, we consider AR in materials with spin-orbit
splitting of the valence band much smaller than the band
gap, ∆ (cid:28) Eg, and neglect the spin-orbit coupling in the
conduction band. The electrons occupy only the ﬁrst
quantum level in the well, i.e. kBT < F (cid:28) δEz, where
δEz is the energy separation between the quantized levels
in growth direction, T is the temperature, and F is the
Fermi energy of electrons.

In order to understand the physical picture, let us con-
sider the limiting case when the electrons are fully spin-
polarized. Since two electrons (1) and (3) in the initial
state belong to the same quantum level in z-direction
and diﬀer only by the values of the momenta within the
plane, it is clear that in the lowest approximation with
respect to the parameter F /δEz (cid:28) 1 their quantum
states are the same and the symmetrized wave function
of two-particle state is zero (suppression is due to the
Pauli principle). It means that non-zero contribution to
the AR rate appears only as a square of the diﬀerence be-
tween the longitudinal momenta of the initial electrons.
Thus, the rate will be proportional to the above men-
tioned parameter. This small parameter describes the
AR rate suppression for the spin-polarized initial state,
as compared to the rate for the unpolarized case. The lat-
ter was calculated in Refs. 4 and 5, but answers obtained
in these papers are mutually diﬀerent in some limiting

cases. Note that a more pronounced suppression of the
Auger rate occurs for a smaller QW width.

It is straightforward to obtain the dependence of the
AR rate on Pn. The Auger rate is given by the expression

Here M is the matrix element of the Coulomb interaction,
and the sum is taken over all the quantum numbers of

functions for electrons and holes.

In the absence of the spin-orbit coupling, the sum over
the spins in Eq. (2) may be written for the unpolarized

electrons as,4(cid:88)

Here MI and MII are the direct and exchange Coulomb
matrix elements, correspondingly. The two terms in Eq.
(3) are due to contributions from the singlet and triplet
states of the initial electrons, correspondingly.

Under the conditions considered in Ref. 4 [when the
initial momenta of electrons within the 2D plane were
small and neglected in Eqs. (4) and (5)], the matrix ele-
ments MI and MII were equal, and only the contribution
which was taken into account was that from the singlet
state, i.e. the ﬁrst term in Eq. (3). It reads

(6)

When electrons are spin-unpolarized, this contribution is
much bigger than that due to the second term in Eq. (3).
Within the approximation outlined above the initial car-
rier energies in the argument of the δ-function in Eq. (2)
can be neglected (these energies are small compared to
Eg). Moreover, since |MI|2 does not depend anymore on
the in-plane momenta of the initial electrons p1, p3, we
can easily perform the summations4 over these momenta

in Eq. (2) (cid:88)

(9)
From the comparison of Eqs. (7) and (9) we conclude
that the AR rate for an arbitrary Pn is related to the
corresponding rate for an unpolarized system through the
simple formula,

R(Pn) = R(0)(1 − P 2
n).

(10)

We note that the rate R(0) can include all the processes
considered in Ref. 5, i.e. thresholdless, quasithreshold
and threshold ones. As it follows from Eq.(10), for the
system of initially fully spin-polarized electrons the AR
rate is totally suppressed. In fact, this conclusion is only
correct in the lowest approximation used above, when
in calculations of MI and MII the initial in-plane elec-
tron momenta p1, p3 were entirely neglected. Let us
estimate the residual value of the AR rate for a fully
spin-polarized system, that is the value of |MI − MII|2,
see Eq. (8). From the expressions for the wave func-
tions of electrons and heavy holes presented in Ref. 5
(we use them at zero spin-orbit coupling) we obtain
|MI − MII|2 (cid:39) |MI|2(p1 − p3)2/p2
0, where p0 is the

3

characteristic electron momentum in the growth direc-
tion (p0 = π/a for the square well of the width a). It
means that the AR rate for the fully polarized electrons
will be suppressed compared to its value at zero polariza-
tion in accordance with the small parameter F /E0 (cid:28) 1,
where F = π2n/me is the electron Fermi energy at zero
polarization and E0 = p2
0/2me is the energy of the size
quantization in the z-direction. We assume that E0 (cid:28) U ,
where U is the height of the barrier for the electrons.
Thus, the estimate for the residual value of the AR rate
for a fully spin-polarized system is
R(Pn = 1) (cid:39) R(0)

If we also take into account a small spin-orbit coupling
for the electron states, we obtain that the residual value
of the Auger rate for a strongly polarized electron system
will be determined by a small factor (∆/Eg)2 (cid:28) 1. This
factor replaces F /E0 in Eq. (11).

In conclusion, we have derived a simple formula which
describes the supression of CCCH Auger recombination
rate in quantum wells with the spin polarization of elec-
tron density. The parameter which describes this sup-
pression is the ratio of the electron Fermi energy and the
electron quantization energy in the growth direction. Our
prediction can be tested experimentally and further moti-
vates eﬀorts to realize eﬀective spin injection in lasers. In
particular, the suppression of Auger recombination with
carrier spin polarization provides opportunities for addi-
tional advantages of spin-lasers over their conventional
counterparts.
