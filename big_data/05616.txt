Gravitational wave (GW) source counts have been recently shown to be able to test how gravi-
tational radiation propagates with the distance from the source. Here, we extend this formalism to
cosmological scales, i.e. the high redshift regime, and we also allow for models with large or compact-
iﬁed extra dimensions like in the Kaluza-Klein (KK) model. We ﬁnd that in the high redshift regime
one would potentially expect two windows where observations above the minimum signal-to-noise
threshold can be made, assuming there are no higher order corrections in the redshift dependence
of the signal-to-noise S/N (z) for the expected prediction. Furthermore, we also consider the case
of intermediate redshifts, i.e. 0 < z (cid:46) 1, where we show it is possible to ﬁnd an analytical ap-
proximation for the source counts dN
S/N in terms of the cosmological parameters, such as the matter
density Ωm,0 in the cosmological constant model or the cosmographic parameters (q0, j0, s0) for a
general dark energy model. We then forecast the sensitivity of future observations in constraining
GW physics but also the underlying cosmology by simulating sources distributed over a ﬁnite range
of signal-to-noise with a number of sources ranging from 10 to as many as 500 sources as expected
from future detectors. We ﬁnd that with 500 events it will be possible to provide constraints on
Ωm,0 on the order of a few percent and with the precision growing fast with the number of events.
In the case of extra dimensions we ﬁnd that depending on the degeneracies of the model, with 500
events it maybe possible to provide stringent limits on the existence of the extra dimensions if the
aforementioned degeneracies can be broken.

INTRODUCTION

The recent detection of gravity waves (GWs) by LIGO
opens a new window into the universe by the ﬁrst direct
detection of gravitational waves emitted from a merging
black hole binary system [1]. Just as cosmological dis-
tances can now be inferred from standard sirens, one can
do the same with number counts. For gravitational waves
emitted from an inspiralling black hole binary system at
high redshifts we have that the amplitude of the waves
(or strain) h+×(t) can be given in terms of the frequency
of the waves f , the chirp mass Mc, the cosmological red-
shift z of the objects and their luminosity distance DL(z)
[2]:

In order to extract cosmological information we have
to know the propagation of GWs in space from the source
to the detector, and its eﬀect on the detector in terms of
S-N ratios, given by:

|˜h(f )|2 = H 2

(1.4)

(1.5)

where Sn(f ) is the spectral noise density of the detectors.
In Ref. [3] it was shown that, neglecting for the time-
being the dependence on the chirp mass, the expected
low redshift (z (cid:28) 1) source counts scale as

dN

d(S/N )

∼ (S/N )−4,

(1.6)

where it was also shown that the expected source counts
can place strong constrains in the underlying theory of
gravity without knowing the actual redshift of the GW
sources. The methodology of Ref. [3] does not require or
assume any redshift dependence for the BH sources and
as a result it can only be valid in short, i.e. not cosmo-
logical (z (cid:28) 1), distances. However, in general we would
expect BH sources to be present also in higher redshifts
and as a result the diﬀerential source counts should pick
up relativistic corrections due to the expansion of the
universe.

It should be noted that it is unclear whether the
hosts of the BH binaries can always be really observed.
Progress was recently made in this direction as Ref. [4] it
was proposed that the cross-correlation between spatial
distributions of GW sources and galaxies with known red-
shifts can be used as an alternative means of constraining
the distance-redshift relation from GWs.

Therefore, anticipating future progress in better de-
termining the redshifts of BH binaries or at least con-
straining their distance-redshift relation, in this paper we
will also consider the high z limit of the diﬀerential GW
source counts, by extending the methodology of Ref. [3].
In this limit we will assume that either the number den-
sity of BH is approximately constant per comoving vol-
ume or that it is proportional to that of the galaxies, as-
suming a GW to galaxy bias bGW and since only a given
fraction of BH binaries coalesce to emit in the form of
GW signal, we can compute the number counts using
the luminosity of these sources as a function of redshift.
Furthermore, we will also consider the case when the
underlying gravity theory is diﬀerent from General Rela-
tivity in four dimensions, thus extending the analysis of
Ref. [3]. In particular, we also allow for models with n
large euclidean or compactiﬁed extra dimensions like in
the Kaluza-Klein (KK) model. Obviously, the ﬁrst case
is readily ruled out, but we still consider it as an inter-
esting toy model. The diﬀerence of our analysis with
that of Ref. [3] is that we also consider the eﬀects of the
gravitons propagating in the extra dimensions, thus also
aﬀecting the source counts.

In the KK case, the propagation of GW will depend
on the radius of the ﬁfth compact dimension or alterna-
tively on the mass of the graviton. Note that the LIGO
collaboration has already provided a bound on the gravi-
ton mass mg < 1.2 × 10−22 eV/c2, which translates into
a distance Rc > 0.3 pc. Old studies of clusters of galax-
ies actually put a much stronger constraint mg < 10−29
eV/c2, or Rc > 10 Mpc. Here we consider the compact
extra dimension to be larger than about Rc (cid:39) 1 Gpc.

II. GRAVITY WAVE SOURCE COUNTS

A. The high redshift limit in 4 dimensions

In this section we generalize the result of Ref. [3] to
all redshifts z. The signal-to-noise associated to a GW
source at redshift z in 4 space-time dimensions and at a
distance DL(z) is given by [2]:

S/N ∝ (1 + z)5/3
DL(z)

.

(2.1)

In Fig. 1 we show the signal-to-noise S/N of Eq. (2.1)
as a function of redshift for the ﬂat ΛCDM model with
Ωm,0 = 0.27 (black solid line), a ﬂat matter dominated
model with Ωm,0 = 1 (dot-dashed line) and the low red-
shift expression of S/N ∝ 1
D (dashed line) extrapolated
to high z. We have normalized the signal-to-noise so
that at a redshift of zLigo = 0.09, the redshift of the
event observed by LIGO, the signal-to-noise corresponds
to S/N = 24, ie S/N (zLigo) = 24. The dotted lines
correspond to the minimum and maximum S/N for the
LIGO experiment. It should be noted that the minimum
S/N occurs at z ∼ 2.72 for the ΛCDM model and at
z = 33/16 (cid:39) 2.06 for the matter dominated one.

FIG. 1: The signal-to-noise S/N of Eq. (2.1) as a function of
redshift for the ΛCDM model with Ωm,0 = 0.27 (black solid
line), a ﬂat matter dominated model with Ωm,0 = 1 (dot-
dashed line) and the low-z prediction of S/N ∝ 1
D (dashed
line). We have normalized the signal-to-noise so that at a
redshift of zLigo = 0.09, the redshift of the event observed
by LIGO, the signal-to-noise corresponds to S/N = 24, ie
S/N (zLigo) = 24. The dotted lines correspond to the mini-
mum and maximum S/N for the LIGO experiment. It should
be noted that the minimum S/N occurs at z ∼ 2.72 for the
ΛCDM model and at z = 33/16 (cid:39) 2.06 for the matter domi-
nated one.

As can be seen in Fig. 1, compared to the low redshift
expression of S/N ∝ 1
D , in reality the signal-to-noise has
some interesting features. First of all, due to the expan-
sion of the universe the signal-to-noise has a minimum
of S/N ∼ 3.29 at z ∼ 2.72 for the ΛCDM model, well
below the detector threshold of (S/N )min = 8. This im-
plies that, contrary to the ∼ 1/D behavior, there is a
physical limit to the minimum signal-to-noise necessary
to observe distant events.

Furthermore, at high redshifts the signal-to-noise coun-
terintuitively grows again due to the expansion of the
universe as the (1 + z)5/3 term overtakes the luminosity
distance DL(z). The physical explanation of this is that
since the signal-to-noise is a quantity integrated over all
the frequencies f , at high redshifts this creates a volume
eﬀect due to the many sources and we now have more
events. This is analogous to the well known eﬀect of the
maximum of the angular diameter distance at intermedi-
ate redshifts, see Ref. [5]. This creates the potentially in-
teresting situation that with the current technology of the
LIGO detectors that operate in the range S/N ∈ [8, 24]
one would expect two possible windows for observations
approximately at z < 0.30 and at higher redshifts ap-
proximately at z > 30, with the latter depending on the
cosmological parameters.

The derivative of the signal-to-noise with respect to

the redshift z is given by:

at some redshift z ∈ [2.1, 2.7], depending on the cosmo-
logical parameters. We will discuss the implications of
this in what follows.

Then, the diﬀerential number counts will be:

while the number of sources with redshift between z and

NBH (z, (cid:96)) dz d(cid:96), where NBH (z, (cid:96)) is the number of BH
sources per proper volume at redshift z with apparent
luminosity (cid:96). However, we are interested in the number
of sources at a given redshift range [z, z + dz] integrated
over all apparent luminosities (cid:96), so we have

We can estimate NBH (z, (cid:96)) dz d(cid:96) in terms of the ˜NBH ,
the number of sources per proper volume and absolute
luminosity L and L + dL as follows, see Section 1.11 in
Ref. [6] but also Refs. [7, 8]:

Now we can express the diﬀerential dr in terms of dt and
ﬁnally to dz via [6]:

Next, we will examine two cases. First, if the BH sources
are not evolving in time and second when the BH sources
are following the distribution of the galaxies.

(2.11)

1. Non-evolving BH sources.

In the non realistic cases of non-evolving BH sources,
studied here only for completeness and since it is much
simpler, we have that the number density ˜NBH (z, L) will
be proportional to (1 + z)3, ie

density is related to the number of sources per proper

tem. Most of these black holes are formed at rest and
have the velocities of the majority of stars in the galaxy.
Therefore, we have that BH sources evolve at
a rate proportional to the galaxy number density
˜NBH (z, L) = bBH (z) Ngal(z, L), where bBH (z) is the
redshift-dependent BH to galaxy bias [4]. Thus, we have

Using Eqs. (2.16) and (2.18) along with an assumption
for the bias bBH (z) allows us in principle to estimate the
diﬀerential source counts

dN

d(S/N ) .

(2.18)

3. The number counts as a function of the S/N

By inspecting Eqs. (2.1) and (2.16) it is obvious that
d(S/N ) as a function of the signal-to-

in order to estimate

dN

noise (S/N ) we need to know both the underlying cosmol-
ogy in order to calculate the luminosity distance DL(z),
but also the number of sources per proper volume at red-
shift z given by ˜NBH (z, L) = bBH (z) Ngal(z, L). There-
fore, for the sake of simplicity in what follows we will
only consider the case of a constant bias bBH (z) = b0.

dN

Unfortunately, at this point we should note that there
are two more problems. First, even if know all of the
above information, ti is obvious that
d(S/N ) will only be
given as a function of the signal-to-noise (S/N ) para-
metrically, as eliminating the redshift analytically from
Eqs. (2.1) and (2.16) is in general not possible, but only
numerically or by using a series expansion as we will de-
tail later on. Also, another problem that arises is that
as mentioned earlier and illustrated in Fig.1 the signal-
to-noise as given by Eq. (2.1) has a minimum at z ∼ 2
depending on the cosmological parameters and clearly its
ﬁrst derivative d(S/N )
obviously becomes zero at the same
z. This is obviously problematic as d(S/N )
appears in the
denominator of the diﬀerential number counts
d(S/N ) as
seen in Eq. (2.10), thus leading in a singularity.

dN

dz

dz

DL(z)

However, it should be noted that Eqs. (2.1) is an ap-
proximation and one should not expect it to be valid at
all redshifts z and as already mentioned in Ref. [12] one
should not really trust it at z (cid:39) 2. Therefore, we will
follow two approaches:
in the ﬁrst, we will consider a
phenomenological modiﬁcation of Eqs. (2.1) of the form
S/N ∝ (1+z)5/3+α
, where α is a constant, chosen such
that there is no minimum or equivalently no singularity
at all and in the second we will remove the singularity
by patching the low z and high z limits with a third
order polynomial. The justiﬁcation for this is that we
expect the signal-to-noise of Eqs. (2.1) to be modiﬁed by
high-order eﬀects, e.g. terms higher than quadrupole in
the expansion or even the possibility that the BHs have
spins. Both eﬀects should in principle induce corrections
in the redshift dependence of Eqs. (2.1), thus alleviating

the singularity, and for the time being are left for future
work. In what follows we will only consider the second
approach.

DL(z)

(1+z)5/3+α

In Fig. 2 we show the two diﬀerent schemes: on the
left panel we show the modiﬁed signal-to-noise S/N ∝
for various values of the parameter α and for
(Ωm,0, w) = (0.27,−1). As α decreases and it becomes
negative, the minimum completely disappears. On the
other hand, on the right panel of Fig. 2 we show the
regularized diﬀerential source counts
d(S/N ) as a function
of redshift for various values of z0, normalized to unity
at it’s maximum value. Now, there is only a small bump
where the singularity was and then the source counts
decrease once again.

dN

In order to calculate parametrically and numerically

dN

the signal-to-noise (S/N ) and the source counts
d(S/N )
we need to specify the maximum redshift zmax up to
which we are evolving equations Eqs. (2.1) and (2.16). In
Fig. 3 we show the numerical solutions to the diﬀerential
source counts dN
dx as a function of the normalized signal-
to-noise x = S/N
for zmax = 1 (left) and for zmax = 3
(right), both for the second regularization scheme nor-
malized to one at x = 1. The black solid line corresponds
to the low redshift expectation dN/d(S/N ) ∝ (S/N )−4,
the dashed line to the unrealistic but simple case of non-
evolving BH sources given by Eq. (2.15) and the dotted
line to the one of evolving BH sources given by Eq. (2.16),
with a constant bias b0 and z0 = 0.7.

S/Nmin

As mentioned before, even though in this case it is not
possible to ﬁnd an analytical expression for the source
counts in terms of the signal-to-noise, it is possible to
do so using a series expansion, assuming that the back-
ground expansion history is given by the cosmological
constant model. First, we perform a Taylor expansion of

FIG. 4: The diﬀerential source counts dN
dx as a function of
the normalized signal-to-noise x = S/N
in the case of non-
evolving BH sources for the numerical result (dashed line)
and the series expansion of Eq. (2.21). For all cases we used
Ωm,0 = 0.27.

(2.19)

where A is the proportionality constant in Eq. (2.1) and
Ωm,0 is the matter density today. Then, using the La-
grange inversion theorem, see Chapter 3.6.6. in Ref. [13],
we invert the series in favor of the signal-to-noise (S/N ):

(2.20)

and ﬁnally we expand Eq. (2.15) around z = 0 and use
(2.20) for the non-evolving BH sources, to ﬁnd

tional form for the bias. Again, we see that the leading
term is ∼ (S/N )−4 as expected.

(2.21)

As can be seen in Eq. (2.21), the ﬁrst term in the expan-
sion goes as ∼ (S/N )−4 as expected from the low redshift
limit ﬁrst derived in Ref.[3]. However, we do not expect
this series expansion to be valid at redshifts higher than
z (cid:39) 1, as then the approximation breaks down. A simi-
lar expression can be found for Eq. (2.16), after assuming
some functional form for the bias.

For both cases we normalized dN/dx to one at x = 1, we
used Ωm,0 = 0.27 and for the series expansion in addition
we also matched its derivative at x = 4 to that of the
numerical case, so as to ﬁx the value of A.

B. The eﬀect of extra dimensions

1. Euclidean extra dimensions

In this section we generalize the result of Ref. [3] to
higher dimensions2. We will assume that there are n
extra space dimensions besides the usual three. Even
though this case is obviously not realistic as any number
of Euclidean extra dimensions would be readily observ-
able, we still consider it as an interesting toy model.

Then, the signal-to-noise associated to a GW source at

redshift at a distance R is given by [2]:

S/N ∝

1

R1+n/2

(2.24)

The radial distribution of the source counts on the hyper-
sphere, since the gravitons also propagate on the extra
dimensions, will be given by:

∝ R2+n

dN
dR

(2.25)

Therefore the diﬀerential number counts will be:

where in the last line we used Eq. (2.24) to relate the
distance R to the signal-to-ratio. As can be seen from
Eq. (2.26) for n = 0 we get the expected result for 4
dimensions.

We can also renormalize the counts with respect to
the minimum signal-to-noise S/Nmin, so that if S/N =
x S/Nmin, then we have

modiﬁcation one should consider as the graviton also propagate
in the bulk. Here, we speciﬁcally consider this case.

cases we have normalized the source counts to unity at
x = 1 for simplicity.

2. Compactiﬁed extra dimensions

In the section we will examine the eﬀect of compactiﬁed
extra dimensions on the source counts. For simplicity,
given the abundance of possibilities, we will consider as
an example a ﬁve-dimensional Kaluza-Klein (KK) theory,
where the extra dimension has a compactiﬁcation radius
Rc. Then, if we assume that the metric does not depend
on the extra dimension, much like in Kaluza’s original
theory. Then the ﬁve dimensional metric would be given
by [14]

AB = diag{gµν,−R2
c},
G(5)

(2.28)

where gµν is the usual four-dimensional metric. Then,
this will induce the existence of a KK graviton mode
with equation, see for example Sec. 1.5 in Ref. [14]:

(cid:3)5h = (cid:3)h + m2

gh = 0 ,

(2.29)

whose solution at large distances is a Yukawa type po-
tential:

h+× ∝ e−R/Rc

R

.

(2.30)

This will act as an eﬀective cut-oﬀ on the ﬂux from BH
binaries’ emission of GW. In this case, we have a similar
result as in Ref. [3] where the authors considered an ad-
hoc signal cut-oﬀ, but now the exponential cut-oﬀ is due
to the eﬀects of the compactiﬁed KK extra dimension.

Again, the signal-to-noise is

S/N ∝ e−R/Rc

R

or equivalently,

(cid:18)

R = Rc W

B

Rc(S/N )

(cid:19)

,

(2.31)

(2.32)

where B is the constant of proportionality in Eq. (2.31)
and W(z) is the Lambert function3.

In this case, as we only consider one extra dimension
with size Rc, like in the simple KK theory, then the radial
distribution of the source counts, since the gravitons also
propagate on the extra dimension, will be given by:

∝ R2Rc.

f (z) = zez or z = f−1(zez) = W(zez) and is implemented
in Mathematica as ProductLog[z].

Source counts follow Poisson statistics and are as such

described by the probability distribution[15]

P (di|λi) = e−λi

λdi

,

(3.1)

where, after dividing the data in Nb bins, di is the number
of objects in each bin i and λi is the mean value of dN/dx
in the bin. In our case the previous expression reduces
to:

(cid:18) dN

(cid:19)

where now i stands for the i-th observation of a
source at the given normalized signal to noise x =
(S/N )/(S/N )min and i = 1, ..., Ntot.

Then, there are are two ways one can can deﬁne the
likelihood and a chi-square statistic χ2 in order to extract
the model parameters. The ﬁrst would be, as in Ref. [3],
to deﬁne the log-likelihood describing the sample of data
points as [15]

In principle also one can choose to have one event per
bin, thus calculating the log-likelihood per object.

The other method, which is also what we will consider

here, is to deﬁne the chi-square as usual:

χ2 =

(Oi − Ei)2 ,

(3.5)

i=1

where Oi is the number of events and Ei = dN
dx i is the
expected number counts, both at a particular xi. We
have checked that we get results in good agreement with
Ref. [3] in the appropriate limit and therefore we will
use this approach in what follows. We now simulate a
random realization of 10, 50, 100 and 500 sample sources
and calculate the likelihood for each of these realizations.
There are two approaches to build these samples.

A ﬁrst approach would be to distribute sources homo-
geneously over S/N up to a maximum threshold, here
taken at S/Nmax = 32 or x = 4. This method obviously
contradicts the fact that the number counts decrease with
increasing S/N . A second, more realistic approach, is to
place the sources with increased probability at low S/N
by virtue of taking Eq. (2.27) as the probability density
function of sources for the case where n = 0 and ˜B = 0,
the expected best-ﬁt for the data where no extra dimen-
sions are present. In this case, the probability distribu-
tion function used to generate the sources at (x, x + dx)
is given by:

P (x) = Dx−4,

x ∈ [x−1/4

we have ˜B = (0.1, 1, 10, 100). In all cases we have normalized
the source counts to unity at x = 1 for simplicity.

S/Nmin

We can also renormalize the counts with respect to
the minimum signal-to-noise S/Nmin, so that if S/N =
x S/Nmin, then we have:

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS

In this section we present forecasts based on simu-
lations of diﬀerential number counts detected at vary-
ing values of signal-to-noise (S/N ) above the threshold
S/Nmin = 8 for all the three cases studied before: the in-
termediate redshift limit, the Euclidean extra dimensions
and the compactiﬁed KK extra dimensions.

From the diﬀerential number counts at a given S/N , as
calculated by Eq. (2.21), Eq. (2.27) and Eq. (2.35) for the
intermediate redshift limit, the Euclidean and compact-
iﬁed KK extra dimensions respectively, it follows that
in all scenarios the diﬀerential number counts depend on
two parameters: A and Ωm,0 for the ﬁrst, C and n for the
second and ˜A and ˜B for the third case respectively. The
aim of this section is to provide forecasted constraints in
each of these parameters.

threshold and strongest event, and D is a normalization
constant.

While both methods have been run through the
pipeline, no signiﬁcant diﬀerences have been found in the
posterior distributions of parameters, and thus from now
on we continue our analysis using focusing the second,
inhomogeneous sampling method to make the mock ob-
servations based on the Poisson distribution of Eq. (3.2).
By doing this, we create mock realizations for the simu-
lated diﬀerential number counts dN/dx corresponding to
each x. Then we can calculate the χ2 by using Eq. (3.5),
and thus the likelihood. As mentioned earlier, we have
checked that our choices for the data analysis are ro-
bust and are in agreement at the appropriate limits with
Ref. [3].

With the likelihood ﬁnally available, we are ﬁnally able
to perform a MCMC sampling of the posterior4. The
following subsections deal with the prior choices, chain
speciﬁcations and constrains on the parameters, for the
three diﬀerent cases with each with 10, 50, 100 and 500
detected sources.

A.

Intermediate redshift limit

We perform the MCMC analysis in the case of the
intermediate redshift limit with the theoretical prediction
for dN
dx given by Eq. (2.21), which has two free parameters
A and Ωm,0 for a ﬂat universe, and assuming a ΛCDM
model with Ωm,0 = 0.27.

In Fig. 7 we show the 2D 68.3% and 95.5% conﬁdence
contours and the 1D marginalized posteriors for the case
of the intermediate redshift limit given by Eq. (2.21) for
the two free parameters A and Ωm,0. The plots cor-
respond to 10 (top left), 50 (top right), 100 (bottom
left) and 500 (bottom right) events respectively. As can
be seen, with a small number of events it is not pos-
sible to constrain the geometry of the universe, hence
Ωm,0, but the situation improves dramatically with 500
events when the best-ﬁt value for the matter density is
Ωm,0 = 0.280 ± 0.083, perfectly consistent with the real
value of Ωm,0 = 0.27.

B. Euclidean extra dimensions

In this case we perform the MCMC analysis in the case
of the Euclidean extra dimensions with the theoretical
prediction for dN
dx given by Eq. (2.27). Note that n and
C are related through the number of observed events,
by C = 2Ntot(n + 3)/(n + 2) and ˜A = 3 Ntot/W( ˜B)3

4 The MCMC analysis was performed with codes developed by the
authors. One such generic MCMC sampler made by one of the
authors can be found at www.uam.es/savvas.nesseris/codes.html

respectively. It is then expected that, for a low number
of sources, they will be degenerate with respect to each
other, though larger number of events may break the
degeneracy and measure both parameters independently,
as seen in a similar case in Ref. [3].

We create the mock data assuming no extra dimen-
sions, i.e. n0 = 0 as the lower bound of the prior. Do-
ing so, we ﬁnd that a suitable upper bound that cap-
tures the full conﬁdence region is very dependent on the
number of sources, since that, while no value of n seems
to adequately constrain the conﬁdence region when only
Ntot = 10 sources are available (thus setting arbitrarily
n ∈ [0, 100] and c ∈ [0, 300]), for the other three sce-
narios with Nobj = 50, 100, 500 the priors n ∈ [0, 2] and
c ∈ [0, 3000] perfectly constrain the parameters.

We map out the posterior function and ﬁnd constraints
on such parameters by running a chain up to 105 samples
long in each of the scenarios considered. Convergence is
quickly achieved and the burn-in phase barely takes more
than 103 steps before the chains becomes Markovian. In
this case the 2D 68.3% and 95.5% conﬁdence contours
and the 1D marginalized posteriors for the two free
parameters C and n can be seen in Fig. 8. The plots
correspond to 10 (top left), 50 (top right), 100 (bottom
left) and 500 (bottom right) events respectively. As can
be seen in the plots, in order to rule out extra dimensions
at a high signiﬁcance > 5σ it requires at least 500 events,
something that could be achievable with future detectors.

C. Compactiﬁed extra dimensions

In this case we perform the MCMC analysis in the case
of the compactiﬁed extra dimensions with the theoretical
prediction for dN
dx given by Eq. (2.35). In this case the
free parameters are ˜B and ˜A and are related through the
number of observed events, by ˜A = 3 Ntot/W( ˜B)3. It
is then expected that for a low number of sources, they
will be degenerate with respect to each other. In contrast
with the previous case, we have not found that a larger
number of events may break the degeneracy between the
two.

For all four scenarios with Nobj = 10, 50, 100, 500 we
take the limiting case of inﬁnite compactiﬁcation radius
for which ˜B = 0 as the lower bound of the prior. We ﬁnd,
however, that no upper bound is able to capture the full
conﬁdence region, which is to be expected if the degener-
acy between the two parameters remains unbroken for a
larger number of events, and thus we arbitrarily choose
˜B ∈ [0, 1] and ˜A ∈ [0, 107].

Again we map out the posterior function and ﬁnd con-
straints on the parameters by running the MCMC up to
105 samples in each of the scenarios considered. Conver-
gence is quickly achieved and the burn-in phase barely
takes more than 103 steps before the chains becomes
Markovian. In this case the 2D 68.3% and 95.5% con-
ﬁdence contours and the 1D marginalized posteriors for

to be at intermediate to large redshifts, i.e. 0 < z (cid:46) 1.

IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

The recent detection of gravity waves (GWs) by LIGO
has been a remarkable breakthrough as it has opened a
new window into the universe by the ﬁrst direct detection
of gravitational waves emitted from a merging black hole

dN

In this paper we extended the methodology of Ref. [3]
by generalizing the source counts
d(S/N ) to all redshifts
by properly taking into account the evolution of the
source properties. First, we found that in the high red-
shift regime one would potentially expect two windows
where observations above the minimum signal-to-noise
threshold can be made, assuming there are no higher or-
der corrections in the redshift dependence of the signal-

to-noise S/N (z) for the expected prediction. However,
this could also be attributed to the fact that the expres-
sion for the signal-to-noise of Eq. (2.1) is valid only for
small to intermediate redshifts, thus making the mini-
mum of the signal-to-noise potentially artiﬁcial. In this
regard, we proposed two regularization methods that
solve this issue and we have left the determination of the
higher order redshift corrections to Eq. (2.1) for future
work.

NBH ∼ (1 + z)3. We took both possible eﬀects into
account and speciﬁcally in the ﬁrst case we allowed for a
BH to galaxy bias bBH (z), as suggested by Ref. [4], and
we also included the proper galaxy redshift distribution
as a function of the median redshift of the survey z0. In
general, taking all these eﬀects into account means that
calculating the the source counts
d(S/N ) is possible only
numerically and requires certain assumptions, such as the
knowledge of the BH to galaxy bias bBH (z).

Another important aspect is whether the GW sources
follow the distribution of their hosts or the less real-
istic case where they simply evolve with the volume

However,

in the simple case where we can assume
the GW sources simply evolve with the volume NBH ∼
(1 + z)3 it is possible to calculate the source counts, as

we had done in Eq. (2.21), by a series approximation at
intermediate redshifts z (cid:46) 1 for the cosmological con-
stant model or by Eq. (2.23) for any dark energy model
described by the cosmographic parameters (q0, j0, s0) in
a ﬂat universe. The source counts for the general case
and for all redshifts, unfortunately cannot be calculated
analytically.

After implementing an MCMC analysis with a vary-
ing number of events, 10, 50, 100 and 500 respectivel,
we found that for a small number of events the number
counts are completely insensitive to the value of the mat-
ter density Ωm,0 of the ﬂat cosmological constant model,
while for a high enough number, i.e. 500 it gives a con-
straint of Ωm,0 = 0.280± 0.083, perfectly consistent with
the real value of Ωm,0 = 0.27 used for the mock data.

We also considered two cases with extra dimensions in

the low redshift limit (z (cid:28) 1), one rather unrealistic but
interesting as a toy model with n extra space-like dimen-
sions and another case with a Kaluza-Klein compactiﬁed
dimension with compactiﬁcation radius Rc. After doing
the MCMC forecasts as before, we found that in the ﬁrst
case we require a number of events of the order of 500
in order to exclude the extra dimensions with a 5σ con-
ﬁdence, while in the case of the KK extra dimension we
ﬁnd that the degeneracies are not fully broken, but in-
stead the parametric space is just made smaller. In any
case, the methodology as described remains promising
as a detection of a high number of events even at high
redshifts z should be possible with future detectors.
