Abstract—In this paper, we evaluate the end-to-end bit error
rate (BER) of point-to-point underwater wireless optical com-
munication (UWOC) systems with multi-hop transmission. To
do so, we analytically derive the BER expression of a single-hop
UWOC link as the building block for end-to-end BER evaluation.
We also apply photon-counting method to evaluate the system
BER in the presence of shot noise. Moreover, we use Gauss-
Hermite quadrature formula to obtain the closed-form solutions
for the system BER in the case of log-normal underwater fading
channels. Our analytical treatment involves all the impairing
effects of the underwater optical channel, namely absorption,
scattering and fading. Numerical results demonstrate that multi-
hop transmission by alleviating the aforementioned impairing
effects of the channel, can signiﬁcantly improve the system
performance and extend the viable end-to-end communication
distance. For example, dual-hop transmission in 22.5 m and 45
m coastal water links can provide 17.5 dB and 39 dB performance
enhancement at the BER of 10−6, respectively.

I. INTRODUCTION

Nowadays the growing interest to underwater explorations
necessitates design of appropriate and efﬁcient underwater
communication methods and systems. In comparison to the
traditional underwater communication method, namely acous-
tic communication, the optical counterpart has three interesting
advantages: higher bandwidth, lower time latency and higher
security. These unique features make underwater wireless
optical communication (UWOC) as a powerful alternative
for high speed and large data underwater communications.
However, presently UWOC systems have the capability to
communicate through ranges that are typically less than 100
m, which hampers their widespread usage. This impediment is
mainly due to the three degrading effects in UWOC channels,
i.e., absorption, scattering and turbulence which cause loss,
inter-symbol interference (ISI) and fading on the propagating
light wave, respectively.

Although, many worthwhile researches have been carried
out to investigate the performance of free-space optical (FSO)
communication systems over turbulent atmosphere channels
[1]–[4], study and design of appropriate UWOC systems yet
have received less attention. The primary works in UWOC
area have mainly focused on investigating the absorption
and scattering effects of underwater optical channels [5], [6].
Meanwhile, UWOC channel impulse response has been mod-

eled using Monte Carlo (MC) approach in [7]. Also a cellular
UWOC network based on optical code division multiple access
(OCDMA) technique has been proposed in [8] while potential
applications and challenges of such a network is elaborated
in [9]. Furthermore, beneﬁcial application of serial relaying
on the performance of OCDMA-based underwater users is
investigated in [10].

On the other hand, turbulence-induced fading in UWOC
channels has been studied in [11], [12]. Moreover, the average
BER of an UWOC system with respect to the log-normal
distribution for fading statistics has been evaluated in [13],
[14]. Also in [15] the authors have proposed spatial diversity
technique,
transmission
over UWOC links, to mitigate degrading effects of turbulence-
induced fading; and therefore to improve the system perfor-
mance.

i.e., multiple-input multiple-output

The research in this paper is inspired by the need to design
an UWOC system to support longer ranges communications
with realistic transmit powers. It has been shown that all
the above mentioned impairing effects of UWOC channels
are incremental functions of distance [7], [12]. This distance
dependency motivates us to design some intermediate nodes,
namely relay nodes, in order to divide a long communication
distance to shorter ones each with much reduced absorption,
scattering and fading effects. Therefore, in this paper we con-
sider multi-hop transmission over turbulent underwater optical
channel. Relay nodes operate based on bit detect-and-forward
(BDF) strategy, i.e., each intermediate node only detects the
received signal from the previous node and forwards the
detected signal to the next node.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section
II, the channel and system models are described. In Section
III, we analytically derive the BER expressions of a single-
hop UWOC link as the building block for end-to-end BER
evaluation. We also apply photon-counting method to evaluate
the system BER in the presence of shot noise. In section
IV, we use the results of Section III to analyze the end-to-
end performance of multi-hop UWOC systems. In Section V,
we provide the numerical results for our derived analytical
expressions as well as MC simulations. Finally, we conclude
the paper in Section VI.

II. CHANNEL AND SYSTEM MODEL

A. Channel Model

As discussed in the previous section, UWOC channel im-
poses absorption, scattering and turbulence on the propagating
light wave. In order to include the absorption and scattering
effects, we apply Monte Carlo method to simulate the UWOC
channel impulse response similar to [7] and [16]. We denote
this fading-free impulse response of the ith hop by h(i)

On the other hand, to take into account the ith hop tur-
bulence effects we multiply h(i)
0 (t) by a fading coefﬁcient
˜h(i), which for weak oceanic turbulence can be modeled as
a random variable (RV) with log-normal probability density
function (PDF) [13], [14] as;

As it is illustrated in Fig. 1, we consider an UWOC system
with N intermediate relay nodes in a serial topology. Each
of the relay nodes operates based on BDF strategy, i.e., each
ith node1 after detecting the received optical signal, transmits
the detected signal with the average transmitted power per bit
of P (i)
. Therefore, the transmitted data sequence of the ith
k P (i) (t − kTb), in
k=−∞ b(i)
k ∈ {0, 1} is the
which Tb is the bit duration time and b(i)
kth time slot transmitted bit of the ith node, representing
on-off keying (OOK) modulation. P (i)(t − kTb) is the kth
time slot transmitted optical signal of the ith node, which
has the average power of P (i)
. For the sake of fairness, we
assume that the total transmitted power per bit of multi-hop
transmission is equal to the transmitted power per bit of single-

hop transmission, i.e.,(cid:80)N

Γ(i) (t − kTb),
(2)
where Γ(i)(t) = P (i−1)(t) ∗ h(i)
0 (t), and ∗ denotes the convo-
lution operation. Each receiver, either within the relay nodes
or in the destination performs symbol-by-symbol processing,
which is suboptimal in the presence of ISI [17]. In other words,
each receiver integrates over each Tb seconds and compares
the result with an appropriate threshold to detect the received
optical signal. It is worth noting that various noise compo-
nents, namely signal-dependent shot noise, background light,
dark current and thermal noise, all affect the aforementioned
detection process.

III. BER OF SINGLE-HOP UWOC SYSTEM

In this section, we analytically obtain the average BER
of single-hop transmission. We also apply photon-counting
method [17] to evaluate the ith node conditional BER in the
presence of shot noise.
A. Analytical Approach

As discussed above, various noise components, i.e., signal-
dependent shot noise, background light, dark current and
thermal noise all affect the system performance. Since these
components are additive and independent from each other,
in this subsection we model
them as an equivalent noise
component with Gaussian distribution [18]. Moreover, we
assume that the signal-dependent shot noise is negligible with
respect to the other noise components and hence the noise
variance is independent from the incoming optical signal
power [19]. Based on Eq. (2), the 0th time slot integrated
current of the receiver output can be expressed as;

f is the optical source frequency and L denotes the channel
memory. It is worth noting that γ(I,k(cid:54)=0) refers to the ISI effect
and γ(I,k=0) interprets the desired signal contribution, i.e.,
γ(I,k=0) = γ(s). Furthermore, vTb is the receiver integrated
noise component, which has a Gaussian distribution with mean
zero and variance σ2
Tb

Assuming the availability of channel state information
(CSI), the receiver compares its integrated current over each
Tb seconds with threshold value of ˜hγ(s)/2. Therefore, the
conditional probability of error when “b0” is sent, can be
obtained as;

[18], [20].

B. Photon-Counting Method

In the previous subsection, we dealt with additive white
Gaussian noise (AWGN) model, which considers the incoming
optical signal as a constant coefﬁcient (conditioned on ˜h) and
all the noise components as an equivalent additive Gaussian
RV. This model, however is straightforward and common [1],
[2], [18], does not consider the shot noise effect induced by
the ﬂuctuating nature of optical signals. In other words, due to
the statistical nature of light as a stream of photons, in optical
systems the signals have random ﬂuctuations which can be
modeled by Poisson distribution [17]. Also signal-dependent
shot noise, dark current and background light can be modeled
as Poisson distributed RVs, while thermal noise induced by
the receiver electronic circuit is usual to be considered as
a Gaussian distributed RV [17]. In this circumstances, either
saddle-point or Gaussian approximations, which are based on
photon-counting methods, can be used to evaluate the system
BER in the presence of shot noise. In this subsection, we apply
photon-counting methods to evaluate the conditional BER of
the ith node.

When the (i − 1)th node transmits data bit b(i−1)

on its
0th time slot, the photo-detected count signal generated by
the ith node integrate and dump circuit can be modeled as
u(i)
th is a Gaussian distributed
b(i−1)
RV with mean zero and variance σ2
th = 2KbTrTb/Rq2,
corresponding to the ith node thermal noise. Kb, Tr and R
are Boltzmann’s constant, the receiver equivalent temperature
and load resistance, respectively. Moreover based on (2),
conditioned on {b(i−1)

It can be shown that the parameters s0, s1 and β(i) can be
obtained by numerical solving of the following set of equations
[17];

(14)
As solving the above equations may be cumbersome and
time consuming, Gaussian approximation, which is simple and
fast but is not as accurate as saddle-point approximation, can
be used to evaluate the conditional BER based on photon-
counting methods. In fact, Gaussian approximation approx-
imates all the Poisson RVs with Gaussian distributed RVs,
where each of the approximated RVs has the same mean and
variance, and then leads to the following equation for the
system conditional BER [17];

IV. END-TO-END BER ANALYSIS

In this subsection, we analyze the end-to-end BER of the
relay-assisted UWOC system relying on the ith node condi-
tional BER, obtained in the previous section. Let U denote the
number of nodes that incorrectly detect their previous node’s
0th time slot transmitted bit. For this case, the conditional end-
to-end correct detection probability Pe2e−b0(c|{ ¯β}, ¯H) can be
obtained as;

N +1(cid:88)
Pe2e−b0(c|{ ¯β}, ¯H) =

Pe2e−b0(c|U,{ ¯β}, ¯H) Pr(U = u|b0,{ ¯β}, ¯H),

(16)

u=0

in which ¯H = (˜h(1), ˜h(2), ..., ˜h(N +1)) is the fading coefﬁcients
vector and { ¯β} implies the transmitted data sequences of all
transmitters. Pr(U = u|b0,{ ¯β}, ¯H) is the conditional proba-
bility that u nodes out of N + 1 nodes incorrectly detect the
received bit. Obviously, Pe2e−b0(c|U = odd,{ ¯β}, ¯H) = 0 and
Pe2e−b0(c|U = even,{ ¯β}, ¯H) = 1. Therefore, the end-to-end
conditional BER can be evaluated as Pe2e−b0(error|{ ¯β}, ¯H) =
Pr(U = u|b0,{ ¯β}, ¯H), where ΛN speciﬁes the
set of all the even numbers in the set {0, 1, ..., N + 1}, i.e.,
of the real value x. On the other hand, Pr(U = u|b0,{ ¯β}, ¯H)
for u = 0, 1, ..., N + 1 can be obtained as;

turbulence leads to a closed form solution, using GHQF as
demonstrated in (6).
It is worth noting that in some common scenarios (e.g., the
following two cases) Pr(U = u|b0) and therefore the average
BER can be expressed more explicitly.
• The form of Eq. (17) suggests that Pr(U = u|b0)
decreases rapidly for larger values of u, since it is propor-
tional to the product of the BERs of u nodes. Therefore,
to simplify the average end-to-end BER expression, we
make an assumption: however, it is possible to detect a bit
correctly at the destination despite of incorrect detection
in some of the intermediate relay nodes, i.e., when u (cid:54)= 0,
we neglect these fortunate events and assume that a bit
can be correctly detected at the destination if and only if
all the receivers detect without an error (i.e., when u = 0).
This assumption is valid particularly when each hop has
a good performance, i.e., a small P (i)
. In this case, the
average end-to-end BER can be evaluated as;

• Suppose that all links have the same average BER of
P (i)
= Pbe−b0. This is a valid assumption for example
when all hops have the same link length and water quality
and all receivers have the same structure. In this case, the
average BER of the system can be obtained as follows;

Averaging Pe2e−b0(error|{ ¯β}, ¯H) over { ¯β} and ¯H results into
Pr(U = u|b0), where Pr(U =
u|b0) is deﬁned as;

probability and ˜h(i)s are also independent, Eq. (18) reduces to
a similar form of Eq. (17) except that P (i)

Pr(U = u|b0), and eventually the end-to-end average BER
Pr(U =

the end-to-end average BER of UWOC
systems with serial BDF relaying can be obtained through
one-dimensional integrals which in the case of weak oceanic

V. NUMERICAL RESULTS

In this section, we present the numerical results for the
relay-assisted UWOC system BER. We also obtain the system
BER using numerical simulations to verify the accuracy of
our derived analytical expressions. We simulate the channel
impulse response similar to [7], [16] and the channel scin-
tillation index for a propagating plane wave like [12]. Table
I shows some of the important parameters for the channel
simulation and noise characterization. In our simulations we
assume that the UWOC system is established in coastal water
[7].

Fig. 2 illustrates the BER of a single-hop UWOC system for
various link ranges and 1 Gbps data transmission rate, obtained
using Eq. (19). As it can be seen, increasing the range of
communication severely degrades the performance. This is rea-
sonable, since all impairing effects of the underwater channel
increase rapidly with the link range. This issue motivated us in
the ﬁrst place, to locate some intermediate relay nodes in order
to have hops with smaller ranges and therefore, with much
reduced absorption, scattering and fading effects. Moreover,
we applied (6) to calculate the system BER using GHQF. It
is observed that the system BER can be effectively calculated
using only V = 30 points. Furthermore, well matches between
the analytical results and numerical simulations conﬁrm the
accuracy of our derived expressions.

In Fig. 3, photon-counting methods, namely saddle-point
and Gaussian approximations are compared. As it can be seen,
Gaussian approximation can provide relatively the same results
as saddle-point approximation. Hence, due to its simplicity
and acceptable accuracy, Gaussian approximation can be con-
sidered as a reliable and favorable photon-counting method.
Moreover, excellent matches between the results of analytical
and photon-counting approaches further conﬁrm the accuracy
of our assumptions in Section III-A.

In Fig. 4,

the average BER of a relay-assisted UWOC
system with 1 Gbps data rate, 45 m end-to-end communication
distance and N = 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 relay nodes is obtained
using Eqs. (20) and (21). As it is obvious, using intermediate
relay nodes provides signiﬁcant performance improvement,
e.g., a dual-hop UWOC system with 45 m and 22.5 m end-to-
end distances can introduce 39 dB and 17.5 dB performance
enhancement at the BER of 10−6, respectively. Moreover, as
it can be seen, (20) provides an acceptable approximate of
the system BER especially for low BERs. Only for high BER
regimes a negligible discrepancy exists between the results
of Eqs. (20) and (21), since (20) neglects the probability of
correct detection for u (cid:54)= 0 and therefore, it provides an
upper bound on the system BER. Comparing Figs. 2 and 3
indicates that the dominant bottleneck on the performance
of a relay-assisted UWOC system is the degrading effects
of each intermediate hop. In other words, a relay-assisted
UWOC system with N intermediate relay nodes and d0 m end-
to-end communication distance can achieve the performance
of a single-hop UWOC system with d0/(N + 1) m end-to-
end distance and by approximately 10 log(N + 1) dB excess
average transmitted power per bit. Furthermore, excellent
matches between analytical and numerical simulation results
conﬁrm the correctness of our analysis for end-to-end BER
characterization.

diate relay nodes and with 105 m end-to-end communication
distance. First, second, third and fourth hops lengths are 22.5

communication, designing the relay-assisted topology should
be of utmost importance. For instance, dual-hop transmission
in 45 m and 22.5 m coastal waters, improved the system
performance at the BER of 10−6 by 39 dB and 17.5 dB,
respectively.

investigated in this ﬁgure by evaluating the end-to-end BER
of the system for various data rates, i.e., 20 Mbps, 100 Mbps,
1 Gbps, 5 Gbps and 10 Gbps, and it is observed that due
to the scattering nature of UWOC channels, increasing the
data rate degrades the system performance. Furthermore, this
ﬁgure indicates the beneﬁcial application of the relay-assisted
topology in UWOC systems, where via 3 intermediate relay
nodes we can appropriately communicate through 105 m
coastal water with a realistic average transmitted power per
bit. This available communication range signiﬁcantly differs
from the reported distances in the existing literature [7], [8].
Therefore, designing the relay-assisted conﬁguration is of
utmost importance for UWOC systems, especially for longer
range communications.

VI. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we analytically studied the end-to-end perfor-
mance of UWOC systems with serial relaying. Our channel
model is based upon the major degrading effects of the chan-
nel, namely absorption, scattering and turbulence-induced fad-
ing. Relying on Gauss-Hermite quadrature formula a closed-
form solution for the BER of system under weak oceanic
turbulence obtained. We also applied photon-counting method
to evaluate the system BER in the presence of shot noise. Well
matches between the results of analytical and photon-counting
methods further conﬁrmed the correctness of our assumption
in derivation of analytical expressions, i.e., the negligibility
of signal-dependent shot noise effect on the system perfor-
mance. Moreover, excellent matches between analytical results
