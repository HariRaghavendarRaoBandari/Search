Abstract. The Beyond Horndeski class of alternative gravity theories allow for Self-accelerating
de-Sitter cosmologies with no need for a cosmological constant. This makes them viable al-
ternatives to ΛCDM and so testing their small-scale predictions against General Relativity
is of paramount importance. These theories generically predict deviations in both the New-
tonian force law and the gravitational lensing of light inside extended objects. Therefore, by
simultaneously ﬁtting the X-ray and lensing proﬁles of galaxy clusters new constraints can be
obtained. In this work, we apply this methodology to the stacked proﬁles of 58 high-redshift
(0.1 < z < 1.2) clusters using X-ray surface brightness proﬁles from the XMM Cluster Survey
and weak lensing proﬁles from CFHTLenS. By performing a multi-parameter Markov chain
Monte Carlo analysis, we are able to place new constraints on the parameters governing
deviations from Newton’s law Υ1 = −0.11+0.93−0.67 and light bending Υ2 = −0.22+1.22−1.19. Both
constraints are consistent with General Relativity, for which Υ1 = Υ2 = 0. We present here
the ﬁrst observational constraints on Υ2, as well as the ﬁrst extragalactic measurement of
both parameters.

The elusive nature of dark energy [1] has prompted considerable research eﬀort into alterna-
tive theories of gravity as a potential driving mechanism for the acceleration of the cosmic
expansion (see [2, 3]), the most common and well-studied being scalar ﬁeld modiﬁcations.
On smaller scales, consistency with Solar System and other tests of General Relativity (GR)
is achieved using screening mechanisms [4]. These are non-linear features of the theory that
ensure that any additional degrees of freedom decouple in the Solar System despite the fact
that they are relevant on cosmological scales. Typically, these come in two varieties: those
that screen by suppressing the scalar charge such as the chameleon [5] and symmetron [6]
mechanisms, and those which screen by suppressing the scalar ﬁeld gradient, such as the
K-mouﬂage [7–9] and Vainshtein [10–13] mechanisms1.

This paper is concerned with the Vainshtein mechanism, which is ubiquitous in scalar-
tensor alternative gravity theories. First seen in the non-relativistic limit of Lorentz-invariant
massive gravity theories [10], the mechanism was re-discovered in the context of DGP braneworld
models [15–17], whose decoupling contains a higher-order derivative interaction known as the
cubic galileon [11] (so called because it involves three ﬁelds). Despite its higher-order nature,
a special galilean symmetry ensures that the ﬁeld equations are second-order and therefore
the Ostrogradski ghost instability is avoided. A natural question to ask is whether one can
ﬁnd other healthy higher-derivative interactions, and the answer is indeed yes; one can also
ﬁnd a quartic and quintic galileon2 [11]. Away from the decoupling limit, it is necessary
to add couplings of the scalar to curvature tensors in order to ensure the ghost-free nature
of the theory on arbitrary dynamical space-times. In this way, one is led to the Horndeski
[18] or covariant galileon [19] theory, the most general scalar-tensor theory that gives rise to
manifestly second-order ﬁeld equations for both the scalar and the metric.

In Horndeski theories, the Newtonian force proﬁle sourced by an object of mass M is

where α is an O(1) coupling constant and rV is a length-scale known as the Vainshtein
radius. The power n > 0 depends on the speciﬁc theory and is equal to 3/2 in the simplest
cubic galileon theories. The ﬁrst term is the Newtonian force predicted by GR and the
second is a correction due to the scalar ﬁfth-force. On scales smaller than the Vainshtein
radius (r (cid:28) rv) this correction is negligible and Newtonian physics is recovered. This is the
Vainshtein mechanism. As an example, the Vainshtein radius of the Sun is of order 102 pc
[20] and so the entire solar system lies well within this. This makes the Vainshtein mechanism
diﬃcult to test on small scales although some attempts have been made3 [30–33].

Recently, it has been shown that there are healthy extensions of Horndeski’s theory
[34, 35] deemed beyond Horndeski theories. In these theories, the equations of motion are
not manifestly second-order in time, but one can always ﬁnd a combination of equations that
is [36] 4. In these theories, the Vainshtein mechanism is only partially successful at screening.
Deﬁning the perturbed Minkowski line-element via ds2 = (−1 + 2Φ) dt2 + (1 + 2Ψ)δij dxi dxj,
the metric potentials sourced by an extended object satisfy the same equations as GR outside
the object but inside they are modiﬁed to [40, 41]

Here Υi are dimensionless numbers that depend on the speciﬁc theory. In the simplest case of
the covariant (G3) quartic galileon one has Υ1 = Υ2 = ( ˙φ/Λ)4 where φ is the (dimensionless)
cosmological scalar and Λ is the mass scale associated with the quartic galileon deﬁned by
2Λ4. Note that this parameterisation has been chosen to make contact with [41–44].
Λ6
Since Φ governs the motion of non-relativistic particles, Υ1 parameterises deviations from
General Relativity in non-relativistic systems. Typically, the mass of astrophysical objects
is more concentrated in the centre (the density decreases radially outwards) and so Υ1 > 0
(< 0) corresponds to a weakening (strengthening) of gravity.
Several works [41, 43–46] have examined the behaviour of non-relativistic stars in these
theories5 and Υ1 is constrained to lie in the interval −0.51 < Υ1 < 0.027 at redshift zero.
The lower limit comes from the consistency of the Chandrasekhar mass with the lowest mass
white dwarf [46] and the upper limit comes from the consistency of the minimum mass for
hydrogen burning in stars with the lowest mass red dwarf [43, 44]. Note that one requires
Υ1 > −2/3 at all redshifts in order to have stable spherically static stellar solutions [45].
Υ2 governs deviations in the motion of light from around non-relativistic objects, and is not
presently constrained at any redshift.

Υi are very important parameters because they are related to the parameters appearing

in the eﬀective ﬁeld theory of dark energy (EFT) [35, 47] via

3In contrast, small scale tests of chameleon (and similar) mechanisms provide the strongest constraints

[21–29].

4Note that one must be careful when combining Horndeski and Beyond Horndeski theories since the wrong

combination can introduce ghosts [37–39]

5Note that [45] use a diﬀerent parameter to Υ1. Furthermore, Υ1 is referred to as Υ in [41, 43–45].

The ﬁrst of these equations was derived by [45]6 and we derive the second in appendix A.
The ﬁve parameters that appear in the EFT completely characterise the linear cosmology
of beyond Horndeski theories7 and therefore constraints on Υi directly constrain deviations
from GR on cosmological scales.

The aim of this work is to place new constraints on Υ1 by comparing the stacked
X-ray and weak lensing proﬁles of galaxy clusters using a similar method to [48, 49] who
have used cluster proﬁles to constrain chameleon models. The intracluster ionised plasma
is in hydrostatic equilibrium8 and is therefore sensitive to Υ1 through the pressure support
equation dΦ/ dr = −1/ρ dP/ dr. The thermal pressure can be directly related to the X-ray
surface brightness (see below) and in this work we use the same data and ﬁtting methods
as [49], with X-ray data from the XMM-Newton public archive [50]. The lensing of light by
the dark matter halo is governed by Φ + Ψ and can hence be used to probe both Υ1 and
Υ2. In the case of chameleon models the lensing is unaﬀected by the modiﬁcations of gravity.
This is not so for beyond Horndeski theories, and it is this that gives rise to our constraining
power. Performing a joint multi-parameter Markov chain Monte Carlo MCMC ﬁt to both the
X-ray and lensing proﬁles, we obtain new constraints on both Υ1 and Υ2 which are consistent
with GR. The clusters in our sample span the redshift range 0.1 < z < 1.2 with a median
value zmed = 0.33, so our constraints apply at this redshift9. Our constraints are therefore
complimentary to those previously obtained at redshift zero, and provide a new hurdle that
any successful beyond Horndeski theory must jump in order to be viable.

This paper is organised as follows: In section 2 we provide a brief introduction to the
principles of cluster physics underpinning our test. Since our methodology is identical to [49]
we do not repeat it in depth and instead refer the reader there for a more detailed description
of the procedure. However, we indicate where the Vainshtein case diﬀers from the chameleon
one, which is mostly in the treatment of lensing. In section 3 we present our results and
discuss the implications for beyond Horndeski models, as well as necessary caveats. We
conclude in section 4.

2 Cluster Properties in Beyond Horndeski Theories

As discussed in the introduction, here we give a brief overview of cluster physics in beyond
Horndeski theories, and our methodology; we refer the interested reader to [49, 51] for a
more detailed account. We describe the dark matter halo using a Navarro-Frenk-White
(NFW) proﬁle [52] which has been shown to be appropriate for chameleon gravity models
via numerical simulations [51],

found that the dark matter density is well described by the NFW proﬁle [53, 54]. When the

modiﬁcations of GR of the form studied here only appear on small scales if there is at least one beyond

where M1(r) represents the diﬀerence between Mtherm(r) and M (r). So far, we have assumed
that the gas is in perfect hydrostatic equilibrium and have ignored any eﬀects of non-thermal
pressure. The addition of non-thermal pressure leads to the modiﬁed relation Mtherm +
Mnon−therm = M + M1, where the non-thermal mass comes from the non-thermal pressure
Pnon−therm and the thermal mass is found by solving the hydrostatic equilibrium equation for
the thermal part i.e. by assuming an equation of state Ptherm = nthermkBTtherm, which is the
part deduced from X-ray temperature proﬁles.
[49] found that non-thermal pressure tends
to increase the hydrodynamical mass Mtherm + Mnon−therm and is therefore degenerate with
regions where M1 > 0, which corresponds to r < rs when Υ1 > 0 and r > rs when Υ1 < 0.

We note that when ﬁtting chameleon gravity models and simulations against our stacked
X-ray surface brightness cluster proﬁles [49, 51] we found no evidence for any signiﬁcant non-
thermal pressure component in the outskirts of the clusters (e.g. infall of gas onto the cluster).
However, as a precaution we did exclude the central 100kpcs from these stacked proﬁles as
it is well-established that the centres of clusters are often aﬀected by cooling ﬂows and AGN
feedback [55].

The weak gravitational lensing convergence, caused by light deﬂection by the cluster

mass, is governed by a radial integral along the line of sight of the quantity

∇2(Φ + Ψ) = 8πGρNFW(r).

Using the fact that ∇2 = r−2 d

where we have again written the contribution from modiﬁed gravity as an eﬀective mass
showing how the lensing mass diﬀers from the true mass in beyond Horndeski theories.
Ignoring non-thermal pressure, one has the consistency condition MWL = Mtherm in GR
whereas here we have found a diﬀerent consistency condition MWL = Mtherm − M1 + M2,
which is the generalisation of 2.20 in [48]. This is the essence of our test. Since we can ﬁt
jointly for Mtherm and MWL, any non-agreement (within errors) can be used to place bounds
in the Υ1–Υ2 plane. Note from equations (2.5) and (2.10) that it is not possible to tune Υ1
and Υ2 such that MWL = Mtherm, and therefore we do not expect to see any degeneracy
between the two beyond Horndeski parameters.

3 Results

In this section we present the results of our MCMC analysis of lensing and X-ray data, and
discuss the implications for beyond Horndeski theories.

3.1 Constraints

The data set and methods used to obtain the bounds on Υi are identical to those used by
[49, 51] with the exceptions that the X-ray proﬁles are now ﬁtted using equation (2.4) and
the convergence is calculated using equation (2.8). To ﬁt this model to our lensing proﬁles
we have converted from convergence to shear assuming spherical symmetry [56]. Brieﬂy,
the cluster X-ray surface brightness and lensing proﬁles are constructed from stacking 58
clusters detected in the XMM Cluster Survey [50] and Canada France Hawaii Telescope
Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS) [57]. The CFHTLenS survey analysis combined weak lensing
data processing with THELI [58], shear measurement with lensfit [59], and photometric
redshift measurement with PSF-matched photometry [60]. These clusters span a range of
redshift (0.1 < z < 1.2, median z = 0.33) and X-ray temperatures (0.2 < Tx < 8 keV, median
Tx = 2.3) and are fully described in [49]. We ﬁt these stacked proﬁles using a full MCMC
analysis (eight parameters covering the NFW parameters c and M200, the cluster properties
T0, n0, b1, and r1, and the modiﬁed gravity parameters Υ1 and Υ2) and our methodology has

modiﬁed; all of the deviations from GR are captured by equations (1.2) and (1.3).

been tested against simulations (both ΛCDM and chameleon gravity) in [51]. Our MCMC
run was a parallelised implementation using 128 walkers with 10000 time steps. We removed
the ﬁrst 2000 iterations as a “burn in” phase.

Figure 1 shows the results of our MCMC analysis, having marginalised over the other
model parameters in [49]. One can see that the data is consistent with GR (Υ1 = Υ2 = 0)
and individually we ﬁnd

Υ1 = −0.11+0.93−0.67

and Υ2 = −0.22+1.22−1.19,

(3.1)

which constitute the best ﬁt values and the 95% conﬁdence range.

3.2

Implications for Beyond Horndeski Theories

To date, only constraints on Υ1 have been obtained (this is because all of the current con-
straints come from stellar probes, which do not respond to Ψ). The constraint we have
derived on Υ2 is the ﬁrst in the literature. This is important because it provides a second
constraint on a diﬀerent combination of the parameters appearing in the EFT (see equation
(1.4)) and therefore improves our ability to constrain the parameters directly.

We note that the redshift range of our sample is 0.1 < z < 1.2 with median value
zmed = 0.33 and therefore the constraints we have derived here do not apply at redshift zero;
they are complimentary to the previous constraints and should be taken to apply at zmed. Any
consistent beyond Horndeski theory should therefore satisfy our constraints at z = zmed as
well as previous ones that apply at z = 0. The EFT parameters are typically time-varying and

– 6 –

dependence of beyond Horndeski cosmologies rather than simply constraining the value of the
EFT parameters today. We note that our constraints should be taken somewhat equivocally
when applied to models where Υ1,2 vary rapidly over the redshift range 0.1 < z < 1.2.

4 Conclusions

Beyond Horndeski theories represent a very general class of ghost-free scalar-tensor modiﬁ-
cations of gravity and therefore encapsulate a wide-variety of dark energy models including
galileon theories that admit de-Sitter solutions [61–63] without the need for a cosmological
constant. They are therefore viable alternatives to ΛCDM11. On astrophysical scales, the
Vainshtein mechanism acts to suppress the scalar force outside of extended bodies but it is
partially broken inside (provided there is at least one beyond Horndeski term i.e. αH (cid:54)= 0),
which gives rise to deviations from the Newtonian limit of GR exempliﬁed by equations (1.2)
and (1.3). This breaking opens up the possibility of distinguishing beyond Horndeski models
from GR locally and is completely characterised by two dimensionless parameters Υ1 and
Υ2, which parameterise deviations in the 00- and ij- components of the metric (Φ and Ψ)
respectively. These parameters are themselves given by combinations of the parameters ap-
pearing in the eﬀective ﬁeld theory of dark energy (see (1.4)), which characterise the linear
cosmology of these theories. Constraints on Υ1,2 therefore constitute constraints on the linear
cosmology of beyond Horndeski theories.

The modiﬁcations have the result that the hydrostatic and lensing mass of clusters are
not equal (as they are in GR) but instead diﬀer by an amount which is a function of Υ1,2 and
the parameters appearing in the NFW proﬁle. In this work, we have exploited this fact by
ﬁtting the stacked X-ray and weak lensing proﬁles of 58 galaxy clusters at median redshift
zmed = 0.33. Using a multi-parameter MCMC analysis described above, we have obtained the
constraints given in equation (3.1). The constraint on Υ2 is the ﬁrst to date, and hence allows
one to constrain the cosmology of beyond Horndeski theories to tighter levels since it is given
by a diﬀerent combination of EFT parameters to Υ1. Furthermore, our constraints are the
ﬁrst that apply at higher redshifts—previous constraints [43, 44, 46] use stellar eﬀects in the
local neighbourhood and hence apply at redshift zero—and therefore represent a constraint
not only on the EFT parameters today but also their time-dependence.

A Relation of Υi to the EFT Parameters

In this appendix we derive the relations between Υi and the parameters appearing in the
eﬀective ﬁeld theory of dark energy. Our goal is not to re-derive the non-relativistic limit,
as this was done by [40, 41]. Instead, we will follow the procedure of [45], and translate the
parameterisation used by [40] into the EFT language. [40] deﬁne the following parameters,
which we give in terms of the EFT parameters using the relations given by [45]12:

M∗Λ2
4MplX

(cid:18) M∗Λ2

α∗ =

ν =

MplX

8

αH α1 =

M∗Λ2
4MplX

(cid:19)2 αH − αT − αB

(αH − αB) α2 =

M∗Λ2
4MplX

αT

F = 1 + αT G = 1 + αH ,

(A.1)

where the speed of tensor perturbations is c2
[40]13

T = 1 + αT . The parameters Υi are given by

Υ1 = −8

α2∗(1 + αB)

Ξ

and Υ2 = − 8α∗α1(1 + αB)

5Ξ

,

where

Ξ = G (4α1α2 − 2α1α∗ + Gν) − 2Fα2
1.

Using the relations (A.1) in (A.2) yields equation (1.4).

(A.2)

(A.3)

12Note that these relations only apply when cubic terms are absent, and that we have translated the
parameters into the mass scale Λ deﬁned in [41]. The conversion to the scale ˜Λ used by [40, 45] (called Λ by
[45]) is ˜Λ3 = MplΛ2. Furthermore, one has X → Mpl
2X. This means that we work with dimensionless scalars
whereas those used by [40, 45] have mass dimension one.

13Note that we have made the same choice as [45] who set ˜Mpl = M∗ where ˜Mpl is deﬁned in [40].
