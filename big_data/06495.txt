This paper presents a connection between the topological properties of hardcore bosons and that of
magnons in quantum spin magnets. We utilize the Haldane-like hardcore bosons on the honeycomb
lattice as an example. We show that this system maps to a spin-1/2 quantum XY model with
a next-nearest-neighbour Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction. We obtain the magnon excitations of
the quantum spin model and compute the edge states, Berry curvature, thermal and spin Nernst
conductivities. Due to the mapping from spin variables to bosons, the hardcore bosons possess the
same nontrivial topological properties as those in quantum spin system. These results are important
in the study of magnetic excitations in quantum magnets and they are also useful for understanding
the control of ultracold bosonic quantum gases in honeycomb optical lattices, which is experimentally
accessible.

INTRODUCTION

In recent years, topologically nontrivial properties of
band theory in electronic systems have become the driv-
ing force in condensed matter physics1–10. Although
electronic band theory has been studied over the past
decades, the topological properties associated with it
have only been appreciated recently. The Haldane
model10 was the ﬁrst example of quantum anomalous
Hall eﬀect (zero magnetic ﬁeld quantum Hall eﬀect) in
electronic systems that originates completely from the
topology of the energy bands. For many decades, this
model was deemed as a toy model due to lack of exper-
imental evidence. Quite recently, the experimental real-
ization of Haldane model10 has been reported in ultra-
cold fermionic atoms in a periodically modulated optical
honeycomb lattice11. This observation has motivated nu-
merous theoretical studies of the eﬀects of interactions in
the so-called Haldane-Hubbard model12–15.

On the other hand, topologically nontrivial energy
bands occur frequently in ordered quantum spin magnets,
however, their topological properties are rarely studied
in quantum magnetism. The study of topological spin
excitations (magnons) recently began with the work of
Katsura-Nagaosa-Lee16 on the kagome and pyrochlore
Heisenberg ferromagnets with a nearest-neighbour (NN)
Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya (DM) interaction17,18. In addition
to breaking the inversion symmetry of the lattice, the
DM interaction plays the role of spin-orbit coupling as
in electronic systems. As a result, the bosons acquire a
phase (magnetic ﬂux) while hopping on the lattice and
the system exhibits similar topological properties as in
electronic systems. However, in bosonic systems there
is no Fermi energy or Fermi level, and the idea of com-
pletely ﬁlled band does not apply. In this respect, the
Chern number characterizing the nontrivial topology of
the energy bands is, in fact, independent of the statisti-
cal nature of the particles. It merely predicts counter-
propagating edge state modes in the vicinity of the bulk
gap as a result of the bulk-edge correspondence. This

leads to magnon edge state modes in ordered quantum
magnets.
Interestingly, the magnon edge state modes
carry a transverse heat (spin) current upon the applica-
tion of a longitudinal temperature gradient. As magnons
are uncharged particles, there is no Lorentz force, the
DM interaction plays the role of a magnetic ﬁeld by al-
tering the propagation of the magnon in the system, thus
leads to thermal Hall eﬀect dubbed magnon Hall eﬀect.
It was discovered experimentally by Onose et al.,19 in the
ferromagnetic insulator Lu2V2O7 with a 3D pyrochlore
lattice structure. Recently, thermal Hall eﬀect has been
observed experimentally on the 2D kagome magnet Cu(1-
3, bdc)20. Besides, phonon Hall eﬀect had been observed
previously21–26 in a completely diﬀerent scenario.

Mathematically, magnon Hall eﬀect is manifested as a
result of the nontrivial topology of magnon bulk band en-
coded in the Berry curvature Ω(k) = ∇k × A(k), which
acts a magnetic ﬁeld, where A(k) is a vector potential.
This result was derived by Matsumoto and Murakami27
and relates the transverse thermal conductivity κxy di-
rectly to the Berry curvature of the magnon bulk bands
reminiscent of Hall conductivity in electronic systems28.
It simply shows that the DM interaction can appear in
any form provided the system exhibits a nontrivial topol-
ogy in the magnon bulk bands. It was also shown that
due to the boson population of the bands at high and
low temperatures, thermal conductivity changes sign as
function of temperature or magnetic ﬁeld on the kagome
and pyrochlore lattices29,30. In addition, spin Nernst and
torque eﬀects have been recently proposed theoretically
in these systems31.

The Heisenberg ferromagnet on the honeycomb lat-
tice is known to exhibit Dirac points in the magnon
energy bands32.
In this regard, we have proposed and
studied a topological magnon insulator on the honey-
comb lattice33,34. We observed many distinctive fea-
tures on the honeycomb lattice. Firstly, the DM inter-
action appears as a next-nearest-neighbour (NNN) cou-
pling transversing through the triangular plaquettes of
the NNN sites on the honeycomb lattice as opposed

It generates a
spin chirality on the triangular plaquettes of the NNN
sites given by χA = Si · (Sj × Sk) on sublattice A and
χB = −χA on sublattice B, where Si is the spin at site
i.
In the spin wave bosonic representation, the result-
ing Hamiltonian33,34 is analogous to the Haldane model
in electronic systems10, which is known to possess a non-
trivial insulating phase. Secondly, due to a small gap gen-
erated by the DM interaction, thermal Hall conductivity
κxy does not change sign as a function of temperature
or magnetic ﬁeld and the low temperature dependence
follows a T 2 law34. Recently, spin Nernst eﬀect has been
studied in this system35.

In this paper, we show that the topological properties
of magnons are not diﬀerent from those of hardcore boson
systems. This is due to a one-to-one correspondence be-
tween bosonic systems and quantum magnetic systems.
We study a Haldane-like hardcore bosons on the hon-
eycomb lattice, which possesses a superﬂuid phase and a
Mott phase. This model has a quantum Monte Carlo sign
problem which hinders an explicit numerical simulation
using this method. However, it can be studied by other
available numerical schemes. We utilize the magnetic
spin analogue of this model by mapping it to a quantum
XY model with a DM interaction. This enables us to
study the magnetic excitations (magnons) of the quan-
tum system. We observe nontrivial topological proper-
ties of this model by studying the magnon energy bands,
edge states, Berry curvature, thermal and spin Nernst
conductivities of the corresponding quantum spin model
of the hardcore bosons. The correspondence between
hardcore bosons and quantum spin systems suggests that
the associated hardcore boson model exhibits the same
properties in the boson language, because its excitations
have to be magnons as well. These results are impor-
tant as they can be studied in cold atom experiments. In
fact, the phase transitions between superﬂuid phase and
Mott phase have been reported experimentally in ultra-
cold bosonic atom experiments in optical lattices36–41.
Hence, it is possible to realize magnon topological prop-
erties by using cold atoms trapped in honeycomb optical
lattices as has been reported in fermionic systems11.

II. HALDANE-HARDCORE BOSONS

As mentioned above, the shortcoming of most topologi-
cal bosonic models is that quantum Monte Carlo (QMC)
simulation is not applicable due to a deliberating sign
problem.
In this paper, we study one of these mod-
els in which QMC suﬀers a sign problem. For hardcore
bosons on the honeycomb lattice without any topologi-
cal eﬀects, QMC has been utilized eﬀectively in the study
of the ground state phase diagrams42,43. In this system
there is a U(1) invariance, hence the bosonic excitations
(magnons) always exhibit a gapless (Goldstone) mode at
the Γ points (k = 0) and the two magnon bands ex-
hibit Dirac points at the corners of the Brillouin zone

√
K(K(cid:48)) = (±4π/3
3a, 0). Such 2D systems with Dirac
nodes have no topological eﬀects in the excitation spec-
trum. The topological properties of these systems have
received no attention mostly for the reason mentioned
above. Fortunately, the hardcore boson Hamiltonian has
a one-to-one correspondence to a spin-1/2 quantum XXZ
or XY model44. Hence, the topological eﬀects in this
model can be studied in terms of the magnetic excita-
tions of the quantum spin model. As in many electronic
systems, topological eﬀects arise when a gap opens at
K(K(cid:48)). There are many diﬀerent ways to open a gap
at K(K(cid:48)). The simplest way is to add a staggered on-
site potential, as has been shown recently45,46.
In the
magnetic spin language, this corresponds to a staggered
magnetic ﬁeld. An alternative way is to add a Haldane-
like imaginary hopping interaction along the NNN sites,
this would correspond to a DM interaction in the spin
language33–35. The resulting Hamiltonian of a gapped
hardcore boson model on the honeycomb lattice can be
written as

investigate the mapping to quantum spin systems, but fo-
cused mainly on the Haldane-Hubbard Hamiltonian with
a Hubbard on-site interacting potential. However, topo-
logical eﬀects should also arise in noninteracting hard-
core bosons 1. In contrast to Haldane model in fermionic
systems10,11, the hardcore bosons 1 can be mapped to a
spin-1/2 quantum spin system44. In the spin language,

the sign of the DM interaction which corresponds to the
imaginary hopping amplitude with Dij = D for i → j
on sublattice A plus cyclic permutations, and Dij = −D
on sublattice B for i → j etc. As mentioned above, this
alternating DM interaction corresponds to a chirality op-
erator χA = Si·(Sj ×Sk) on sublattice A and χB = −χA
on sublattice B, where Si is the spin at site i. It is impor-
tant to note that the spin Hamiltonian 2 is unfrustrated
in all the parameter regimes. It simply describes a canted
spin texture which is a ferromagnetic insulator. Hence,
Eqs. 1 and 2 describe an ordered system and the magnon
excitations of the spin system correspond to excitations
of the hard-core bosons.

It is well-known that topologically nontrivial prop-
erties of magnon excitations such as magnon edge
states,
ef-
fect,
can be understood entirely by semiclassical
approximations16,19,27,29,30,33–35. Spin wave theory pro-
vides the simplest way to study the topological eﬀects in
ordered quantum magnetic systems. In this section, we
apply this formalism to the present model.

A. Mean-ﬁeld phase diagram.

The mean ﬁeld phase diagram provides the possi-
ble phases in the system.
In the mean ﬁeld ap-
proximation, the spins can be approximated as clas-
sical vectors parameterized by a unit vector: Si =
S (sin θi cos φi, sin θi sin φi, cos θi). There are two sublat-
tices on the honeycomb lattice as shown in Fig. 1. The
classical energy with φi = 0 (coplanar spins) is given by
Ec/N S = −hc sin θA sin θB − h(cos θA + cos θB), (3)

3

where N is the number of unit cells, hc = 2JSz is the
critical ﬁeld, and z = 3 is the coordination number of
the lattice. At the mean-ﬁeld level, the DM interaction
does not contribute to the classical energy. The ﬁlling
factor is given by ρ = 1/2 + S(cos θA + cos θB)/2. In this
model, there are only two possible phases — a canted
ferromagnet or superﬂuid at small magnetic ﬁeld and a
fully polarized ferromagnet or Mott phase, with the spins
eqnarrayed along the z-axis at large magnetic ﬁeld. In
both ferromagnets θA = θB = θ. The ﬁlling factor for
the Mott phases are ρ = 0 (empty) and ρ = 1 (full) for
Sz = ∓S respectively. The phase boundary is obtained
by minimizing Eq. 3 yielding cos θ = h/hc.

B. Magnetic excitations

In ordered quantum magnets, it is customary to study
magnetic excitations by linear spin-wave theory. In the
spin wave expansion, we ﬁrst rotate the coordinate axes
so that the z-axis coincides with the local direction of the
classical polarization.

6JS sin2 θ + h cos θ. At zero magnetic ﬁeld, the spins
are aligned along the x-axis and θ = π/2. Hence, the
z-component of the DM interaction does not contribute
in the linear spin wave expansion, as it is not along the
quantization axis. In this case, one should take D = Dˆx.
As one can discern from Eq. 5, the XY model does
not have a simple analogue to Haldane model10 as the
Heisenberg ferromagnets16,19,27,29,30,33–35. This is due to
additional oﬀ-diagonal term with coeﬃcient v2. Fourier

FIG. 3: Color online. The spin-1/2 magnon Berry curvatures
of the hardcore bosons for the top and bottom bands of Fig. 2.

The spin wave Hamiltonian in Eq. 7 is Hermitian but
it is not diagonal. It is diagonalized by a matrix U(k)
†
via the transformation Ψ

the relation

k contains the Bogoliubov

k) and (k) = [(k),−(k)] are the eigen-
operators (α
values. This transformation leads to a non-Hermitian
Bogoliubov Hamiltonian HB(k) = ηH(k), which is given
by

HB(k) = σza(k) + iσyb(k) + m(k)Iστz,

(10)

where

a(k) = τ0v0 − ˜v1(τ+γk + h.c.),
b(k) = −˜v2(τ+γk + h.c.).

(11)
(12)

The eigenvalues of the non-Hermitian Bogoliubov Hamil-
tonian give the magnon energy bands. For m(k) = 0, the
matrices a(k) and b(k) are constants of motion and can
be diagonalized separately. In this case the Hamiltonian

corresponds to the conventional XY model (or hardcore
bosons) and the energy bands are gapless at K(K(cid:48)). For
m(k) (cid:54)= 0 this symmetry is broken and dynamics are in-
troduced into the system. The positive eigenvalues are
given by

(cid:115)(cid:18)

(cid:113)

λ(k) =

v0 + λ

(˜v1|γk|)2 + [m(k)]2

(cid:19)2 − (˜v2|γk|)2,

(13)
where λ = ± labels the top and the bottom bands of the
positive energies.
Although the DM interaction does
not contribute to the classical energy, the magnon exci-
tations depend on it, thus a chiral superﬂuid is formed in
the magnon bands. The two magnon bulk bands in chiral
superﬂuid phase are shown in Fig. 2. At K(K(cid:48)), γk = 0
√
and m(k) = m = ∓3
3vD, hence a gap of magnitude
2|m| is generated in the magnon bulk bands. As men-
tioned above, the topological properties of this system
are manifested once a gap opens at K(K(cid:48)) in the magnon
bulk bands. From the bulk-edge correspondence, we ex-
pect magnon edge states in the vicinity of the bulk gap.
Indeed, we observe such edge states as shown in Fig. 2.

FIG. 4: Color online. Spin Nernst conductivity (a) and Thermal Hall conductivity (b) of hardcore bosons in honeycomb lattice
with J = 0.5; D = 0.25J. We have set the natural constants to unity.

Due to the mapping from spin variables to bosonic oper-
ators and verse versa, the hardcore boson model 1 also
exhibits bosonic edge states.

An important consequence of gapped systems is the
non-vanishing of the Berry curvature associated with the
topology of the energy bands. The Berry curvature asso-
ciated with the gapped hard-core bosons is given by

Ωλ(k) = −2Im[(cid:104)∂kx ψλ(k)|∂ky ψλ(k)(cid:105)],

(14)

where |ψλ(k)(cid:105) are the positive eigenvectors. It is more
feasible to calculate the Berry curvature numerically.
Hence, Eq. 14 can be written as

Ωλ(k) = −(cid:88)

λ(cid:54)=λ(cid:48)

D. Thermal and Spin Nernst conductivities

In the preceding sections, we have explicitly demon-
strated the nontrivial topological properties of the
gapped honeycomb hardcore bosons. As mentioned in
the Introduction, the magnon edge states carry a heat or
spin current upon the application of a temperature gra-
dient. This is, in fact, due to the nontrivial topological
properties of the Berry curvature. These edge states lead
to two important phenomena — thermal Hall eﬀect27 and
spin Nernst eﬀect.31 They are characterized by two con-
ductivities given by27,31

Figure 3 shows the Berry curvatures for the top and the
bottom bands. It is obvious that the dominant contribu-
tions come from the states near K and K(cid:48). In the low-
energy limit, we expand the Hamiltonian near K(K(cid:48)).
We obtain

HB(k) = σz[Iτ v0 − ¯v1(ξτxkx + τyky)]

− iσy ¯v2(ξτxkx + τyky) + ξmIστz,

(16)

where ξ = ∓ for states at K(K(cid:48)) and ¯v1,2 = 3v1,2/2. At
the fully polarized Mott states, θ = 0 or θ = π, we have
¯v1 = 3v0/2 and ¯v2 = 0. Then, the model decouples into
two Bogoliubov Hamiltonians. In this case, Eq. 16 is sim-
ilar to the Haldane model10. This is a direct consequence
of the hard-core boson Hamiltonian 1.

where αxy is the spin Nernst conductivity and κxy
is the thermal Hall conductivity; nλ ≡ nB[λ(k)] =
[eλ(k)/kB T − 1]−1 is the Bose function and the ci func-
tions are c1(x) = (1 + x) ln(1 + x) − x ln x; c2(x) =

(cid:1)2 − (ln x)2 − 2Li2(−x), and Lin(x) is a

(1 + x)(cid:0)ln 1+x

x
polylogarithm.

The plots of αxy and κxy as functions of tempera-
ture for varying magnetic ﬁeld are shown in Fig. 4. The
spin Nernst conductivity vanishes at zero temperature
as there is no thermal excitations. In stark contrast to
the Heisenberg ferromagnet35, it increases with increas-
ing magnetic ﬁeld as the system progresses from chiral
superﬂuid phase to Mott phase and approaches a con-
stant value at high temperature. The thermal Hall con-
ductivity on the other hand is negative and never changes
sign. At small magnetic ﬁeld the system is in the chiral
superﬂuid phase. As the magnetic ﬁeld increases, κxy
decreases as the system transits to the Mott insulator

Eq. 1 should exhibit the same properties due to the map-
ping from spin variables to bosonic operators.

erators are not independent. They are related by the
identities:

Though the noninteracting hardcore boson model cap-
tures topologically nontrivial properties, in most cases
of physical interest interactions are not negligible. The

opening at K(K(cid:48)), hence its eﬀects are negligible in the
topological considerations. Furthermore, we claim that
these topological properties should also be observed in
frustrated systems. For the XY model on the honey-
comb lattice, frustration is induced by an antiferromag-
netic NNN coupling48. The system also possesses ordered
states in the phase diagram, and the excitations of these
ordered states should exhibit similar topological proper-
ties when a nontrivial gap is introduced. However, the
explicit analysis of this frustrated model is beyond the
purview of this paper.

SCHWINGER BOSON MEAN-FIELD

THEORY

The Schwinger boson mean-ﬁeld theory49 provides an-
other semiclassical approach to study the magnon exci-
tations in quantum magnets. This method has been em-
ployed to study the magnon bulk bands of SU(2) Heisen-
berg ferromagnets with DM interactions.30,35 In this rep-
resentation, the spin operators are mapped to bosons us-

The momentum space Hamiltonian can be written in the
same form as the HP case with summation over spins and
the Bogoliubov Hamiltonian is given by
HBσ(k) = m(k)Iστz + σz[Iτ v0(k) − ˜v1(τ+γk + h.c.)]
(31)

− ˜v2iσy(τ+γk + h.c.),

and ˜ρk = 2(cid:80)

where ˜v1 = −zσJP/2, ˜v2 = −zJQ/2, m(k) =
−σDQ1,−σρk/2, v0(k) = (λ − σh/2 − σD ˜ρkQ2,−σ/2),
µ cos k · aµ. To determine the P (cid:48)s and the
Q(cid:48)s one needs to diagonalize Eq. 31 using the Bogoliubov
quasiparticles and solve a self-consistent equation. We
do not perform this procedure here as it is not necessary
since it gives quantitatively the same result as the con-
ventional spin wave theory. In fact, experimental results
reported on the kagome ferromagnet20 suggest that the
Holstein Primakoﬀ transformation is a better predictor
than the Schwinger boson representation. The purpose
of this section is to provide an alternative representation
of the spin wave Hamiltonian.

V. SPINFUL HALDANE-HUBBARD MODEL

The spinful Haldane-Hubbard model has recently gar-
nered much attention.12,14,15 The Hamiltonian is gov-
erned by

We restrict the operators to obey only the boson commu-

of this model for fermionic systems have been discussed
in Ref.12,14,15. For bosons, it has not been studied exten-
sively in the topological context. Considering only the
ﬂux enclosed by the unit cell in the big triangular pla-
quettes of the NNN sites, in the strong coupling limit

sums over the triangular plaquettes on the NNN sites. It
corresponds exactly to the DM interaction as discussed
above. In this model, the interactions are ferromagnetic.
Quite remarkably, Eq. 33 is exactly the model studied
in Ref.33–35 These results show a strong relationship be-
tween bosonic systems and quantum spin systems.

VI. CONCLUSION

The main result of this paper is that the topological
properties of hardcore bosons and that of magnons in
quantum magnets are not independent. This is because
topological eﬀects manifest in the excitations of the cor-
responding system and the hardcore bosons correspond
to quantum magnetic systems. In the spin language, we
have shown that the Haldane-hardcore bosons exhibit in-
teresting nontrivial topological properties. This suggests
that the bosonic excitations of hardcore bosons (which
have to be magnons) possess the same topological prop-
erties. Although QMC is not applicable in the present
model, other numerical schemes should provide further
insights into these topological eﬀects. We believe that
these nontrivial topological eﬀects should also manifest in
frustrated systems by including a next-nearest-neighbour
antiferromagnetic interaction. We also showed that in
the strong coupling limit of the spinful Haldane-Hubbard
model on the honeycomb lattice, the system maps to
Heisenberg ferromagnet whose topological magnon exci-
tations have been studied recently. This correspondence
suggests experimental procedures in cold atoms on the
honeycomb optical lattices to search for these interesting
topological properties in bosonic and magnetic systems.
