ORDER NINE MMIK GRAPHS

THOMAS W. MATTMAN, CHRIS MORRIS, AND JODY RYKER

Abstract. We show that there are exactly eight MMIK (minor minimal in-
trinsically knotted) graphs of order nine.

Introduction

A graph is intrinsically knotted (IK) if every tame embedding in R3 has a
nontrivially knotted cycle. Since the opposite property ‘not intrinsically knotted’
is closed under taking minors [NT], it follows from the Graph Minor Theorem of
Roberston and Seymour [RS] that the set of IK graphs is characterized by a ﬁnite
set of MMIK (minor minimal IK) graphs. Recall that a minor of a graph G is
any graph obtained by contracting edges in a subgraph of G. We say that graph
G is minor minimal with respect to graph property P if G has P, but no proper
minor does.

In their seminal paper Conway and Gordon [CG] demonstrate that K7 is IK
and Kohara and Suzuki [KS] subsequently showed it is MMIK. This means K7 is
the unique MMIK graph on seven vertices and any graph of lesser order is not
IK. Two groups, working independently, classiﬁed the MMIK graphs on eight ver-
tices [BBFFHL, CMOPRW]; there are exactly two: K3,3,1,1 and the graph obtained
by a single ∇Y exchange on K7. We take the next step by proving the following.
Theorem 1. There are exactly eight MMIK graphs of order nine.

The eight graphs have all been described elsewhere, including proofs that they
are MMIK. In this paper we show there are no other examples. Two of the graphs
are in the K7 family, ﬁrst described by Kohara and Suzuki [KS]; they call those
graphs F9 and H9 and proved that they are MMIK.

The remaining examples are described in [GMN]; in this paragraph we summarize
the relevant ideas from that paper. The family of a graph G is the set of graphs
that can be obtained from G by a sequence of ∇Y and Y∇ moves. The K3,3,1,1
family contains four MMIK graphs of order nine. Two of these come from ∇Y
moves on K3,3,1,1 and were known to be MMIK by combining work of Foisy [F]
with Kohara and Suzuki [KS]. Returning to [GMN], the authors show that the
other two order nine graphs in that family are also MMIK. For this, they use Miller
and Naimi’s [MN] program to argue that the two graphs are IK. The ﬁnal two
MMIK graphs of order nine are called E9 + e and G9,28 in [GMN]. They have a
traditional proof that G9,28 is MMIK while again relying on the program of [MN]
to verify that E9+e is IK. In summary, Miller and Naimi’s program is used to show
that three of the order nine graphs are IK. Even in those cases, the authors provide
a traditional proof that those graphs are minor minimal IK. See [GMN] for details.

Our proof that there are no other instances of order nine MMIK graphs also relies
on computers. Let us ﬁrst outline the parts of the argument that are independent
of the computer. In her thesis [R], the third author proves the following.

Proposition 2. The only order nine MMIK graph of size 28 or greater is G9,28.

The classiﬁcation of MMIK graphs of size 21 or less is due, independently, to

two groups and has the following corollary.

Corollary 3. [BM, LKLO] There are exactly two order nine MMIK graphs of size
at most 21, F9 and H9.

In the current paper, we give a conventional proof for graphs on 22 edges.

Proposition 4. There are exactly ﬁve order nine MMIK graphs of size 22.

We prove Propositions 2 and 4 in Sections 2 and 3 respectively. What remains is
to prove that there are no order nine MMIK graphs with between 23 and 27 edges.
For this we rely on computers. As described in Section 4, we have two distinct
approaches implemented in three diﬀerent computer languages. We feel that this
variety of techniques and languages all pointing to the same conclusion amount
to a rather robust proof of the remaining cases. Together with Corollary 3 and
Propositions 2 and 4, the argument of Section 4 completes our proof of Theorem 1.
We begin by gathering preliminary deﬁnitions and lemmas in the next section.

1. Definitions and Lemmas

This section collects a number of deﬁnitions and lemmas used through the rest
of the paper. For a graph G, |G| will be the order or number of vertices and (cid:107)G(cid:107)
the size or number of edges, and we frequently use the pair (|G|,(cid:107)G(cid:107)) to describe
a graph. The maximum and minimum degree among the vertices of G are denoted
∆(G) and δ(G), respectively. We denote the complement of G as ¯G. For vertex
a, N (a) denotes the neighborhood of a, meaning the set of vertices adjacent to a.
For a, b ∈ V (G), G − a and G − a, b are the induced graphs on V (G) \ {a} and
V (G) \ {a, b}. A graph is said to be n-apex if there is a set of n or fewer vertices
whose deletion makes G planar. This generalizes the notion of apex, common in
the literature and which corresponds to 1-apex. The abbreviation MMNA describes
graphs that are minor minimal not apex. Similarly MMN2A graphs are those that
are minor minimal for the property not 2-apex.
For graph G containing a 3-cycle abc, a ∇Y move results in a graph G(cid:48) of equal
size to G but with an additional vertex v. The edges of the 3-cycle are deleted
and replaced with av, bv, and cv. We say that G(cid:48) is a child of G. The reverse
operation (delete a degree three vertex v and make N (v) a 3-cycle) is a Y∇ move.
We generally assume that any extra, doubled edges introduced by a Y∇ move are
deleted so that the resulting graph is, again, simple.

In this paragraph we deﬁne several named graphs used here as well as in the two
theses [Mo, R] that are the basis of Sections 2 and 4. Graphs H8, F9, and H9 are
MMIK graphs in the K7 family and were named by Kohara and Suzuki [KS]. We
use A9 and B9 to denote the two children of K3,3,1,1. These are called L1 and L2
in [OT], and are Cousins 2 and 3 in the K3,3,1,1 family as described in [GMN]. As
with all graphs in that family, A9 and B9 are MMIK.

The third author’s thesis [R] includes an unknotted embedding (due to Ramin
Naimi [N]) of a (9, 29) graph that we call 260910. The complement of 260910 is the

disjoint union of a 6-cycle, K2, and K1. It’s also given by adding the edges {1, 2},
{2, 3}, and {2, 4} to the graph G9,26 described near the end of Section 4.
Lemma 5. If G is MMIK, then δ(G) ≥ 3.
Proof. Suppose G is IK. If δ(G) ≤ 2, we can form a proper minor H either by
deleting a vertex, or by contracting an edge adjacent to a vertex of degree one or
(cid:3)
two. Then H is also IK, and G is not MMIK.

Lemma 6. If G is IK and H is a child of G, then H is also IK.

Proof. Sachs [S] showed this for the intrinsic linking property. The proof for IK is
(cid:3)
similar.
Lemma 7. [CMOPRW] If |G| = n > 7 and (cid:107)G(cid:107) ≥ 5n − 14, then G is IK but not
MMIK.

Proof. Mader [Ma] has shown that such a graph has a K7 minor.

Lemma 8. [BBFFHL, OT] If G is IK, then G is not 2-apex

(cid:3)

Lemma 9. [BM] A graph that is not apex has at least 15 edges. The graphs in the
Petersen family are the only MMNA graphs of size 16 or less.

2. Proof of Proposition 2

In this section we summarize the proof of Proposition 2, see [R] for additional

detail. We begin with a lemma.
Lemma 10. If G is MMIK of order nine and (cid:107)G(cid:107) = 29 or 30, then δ(G) ≥ 4.
Proof. Let G be MMIK and either (9, 29) or (9, 30). By Lemma 5, δ(G) ≥ 3.
Suppose there is a vertex of degree three and perform the Y∇ move on G to obtain
a graph G(cid:48) of order eight. After removing doubled edges, 26 ≤ (cid:107)G(cid:48)(cid:107) ≤ 28, and by
Lemma 7, G(cid:48) is IK. Reverse the Y∇ move by applying a ∇Y move to G(cid:48) to obtain
the graph H, a proper subgraph of G. Then H is IK by Lemma 6, contradicting G
MMIK. Therefore, δ(G) ≥ 4.
(cid:3)
Proof. (of Proposition 2) Let |G| = 9. By Lemma 7, if (cid:107)G(cid:107) ≥ 31, then G is not
MMIK. This leaves three cases: (cid:107)G(cid:107) = 30, 29, and 28.

Suppose G is a (9, 30) graph. There are exactly 63 such graphs, four of which
have δ(G) < 4 and are not MMIK by Lemma 10. Of the remainder, 51 have the
MMIK graph A9 as a subgraph. An additional ﬁve are 2-apex and of the from
P + K2, the join with K2 of a planar triangulation on seven vertices. This leaves
three graphs, two of which have B9 as a subgraph and the last having a K7 minor.
Next suppose G is a (9, 29) graph. There are exactly 148 such graphs, of which
15 have δ(G) < 4. The remainder include 25 graphs that are subgraphs of the size
30 P + K2 examples as well as a graph (called 260910 in [R]) that has an unknotted
embedding although it is not 2-apex. (The unknotted embedding given in [R] is
due to Ramin Naimi [N].) The other 107 graphs are IK but not minor minimal as
they admit either an A9 subgraph (97 graphs) or else a K7 or B9 minor (ﬁve each).
There are 344 connected (9, 28) graphs, of which 11 have δ(G) < 3 and 39
δ(G) = 3. The analysis of [R] is mainly concerned with the 294 graphs with
δ(G) > 3. For example, the appendix of that paper includes drawings of all of
those graphs. As mentioned there, there are 181 IK graphs including 168 having F9

subgraph, four with a B9 subgraph, and a further eight with a K7 minor. Although
these 180 graphs are IK, the proper minors show that they are not MMIK. In
addition, there is a single MMIK graph, whose complement is the disjoint union
of K2 and a seven cycle. (See also [GMN] where this graph is called G9,28 and
shown to be MMIK.) The remaining 113 graphs are not IK, and all but two of
these are 2-apex. Those two are subgraphs of the (9, 29) graph 260910 which has
an unknotted embedding. There are a couple of typos in [R], which we correct here.
There are 97 (and not 98) graphs whose complement has three components. In case
the complement consists of two isolated vertices and a third connected component,
there are 56 (and not 57) graphs with F9 subgraph.

It remains to investigate the 39 graphs of minimum degree three. Let G be a
(9, 28) graph with δ(G) = 3. It’s easy to see that there can be at most one degree
three vertex, let’s call it a, and denote by G(cid:48) the result of a Y∇ move at a. We
delete any double edges so that 25 ≤ (cid:107)G(cid:48)(cid:107) ≤ 28. Suppose G(cid:48) is IK. Then applying a
∇Y move to reverse the Y∇ move gives H, an IK subgraph of G with (cid:107)H(cid:107) = (cid:107)G(cid:48)(cid:107).
If H is a proper subgraph of G, then G is not MMIK. The only other possibility
is that (cid:107)G(cid:48)(cid:107) = 28, meaning G(cid:48) is K8. But a ∇Y move on K8 results in a graph
(H = G) that has a F9 subgraph and is not MMIK.
CMOPRW], G(cid:48) is one of two graphs, both of which are 2-apex. We’ll argue G must
also be 2-apex, hence not MMIK. Note that losing three edges in the Y∇ move
means a is part of a K4 subgraph in G. In other words, G is formed from G(cid:48) by
adding, to a 3–cycle xyz of G(cid:48), vertex a and the three edges ax, ay, and az. The
two G(cid:48) graphs have, up to symmetry, three or ﬁve 3–cycles respectively. It’s easy
to check that adding a and its edges to any of these results in a graph G that is
(cid:3)
again 2-apex.

So, we may assume G(cid:48) is not IK. By the classiﬁcation of order eight IK graphs [BBFFHL,

3. Proof of Proposition 4

Proof. (of Proposition 4) Suppose G is a (9, 22) MMIK graph. By Lemma 8, G is
not 2-apex and, for any vertex a, G − a is not apex. By Lemma 9, (cid:107)G − a(cid:107) ≥ 15,
so ∆(G) ≤ 7. Since a 4–regular graph has only 18 edges, ∆(G) ≥ 5.
Suppose ∆(G) = 5. Then G has degree sequence (58, 4) and there are a pair of
nonadjacent degree ﬁve vertices a, b so that G − a, b is a nonplanar (7, 12) graph
with δ(G − a, b) ≥ 2. Moreover, G − a, b can have at most one degree two vertex.
We next show that we can assume ∆(G − a, b) = 5.

Indeed, if not, then for every choice of vertices a, b of degree ﬁve, every other
vertex of degree ﬁve is adjacent to at least one of a and b. This means that, in the
complement, there are no triangles of degree ﬁve vertices. Deleting the degree four
vertex gives a (8, 18) graph. The complement G − a is then a triangle free (8, 10)
graph of degree sequence (34, 24). Contract an edge adjacent to each degree two
vertex to make a minor that is a 3–regular (4, 6) multigraph, either K4 or a 4–cycle
with opposing edges doubled. Subdividing edges so as to eliminate triangles, we
see that there are only ten such (8, 10) graphs G − a. Adding back the degree four
vertex, we ﬁnd that each of the resulting graphs is 2-apex, contradicting that G is
MMIK.
We assume, then, that ∆(G − a, b) = 5, δ(G − a, b) ≥ 2, and that G − a, b is
(7, 12) and nonplanar. There are six such graphs shown in Figure 1. In each case,

deleting the two starred vertices in G results in a planar graph. Therefore, G is
2-apex and not MMIK, a contradiction.
Next, suppose ∆(G) = 7. Deleting a vertex a of maximal degree leaves an (8, 15)
graph G− a that is not apex. Since G is MMIK, by Lemma 5, δ(G− a) ≥ 2. Then,
by Lemma 9, G−a is one of the two (8, 15) Petersen family graphs, which we denote
K4,4 − e and P8. Since a has degree seven, it is adjacent to all but one vertex in
G − a.
Suppose G − a is K4,4 − e. There are two types of vertices, of degree three and
four, in K4,4 − e, and consequently G is one of two graphs. If a is adjacent to every
vertex of G − a but one of degree three, then G has a proper H9 minor and is not
MMIK. On the other hand, if it’s a degree four vertex that is not a neighbor of a,
then G is 2-apex and again, not MMIK.

THOMAS W. MATTMAN, CHRIS MORRIS, AND JODY RYKER

There are four types of vertices in P8 and four graphs that can be constructed by
adding a degree seven vertex to it. One of them is A9. The others are not MMIK,
one because it has a proper F9 minor, the other two being 2-apex.

Figure 2. Seven (8, 12) graphs formed by adding an edge to an
order eight Petersen graph.

In the remainder of the proof, we assume ∆(G) = 6. For a vertex a of maximal
degree, G − a is an (8, 16) not apex graph with ∆(G − a) ≤ 6 and δ(G − a) ≥ 2.
By Lemma 9, G − a has a minor in the Petersen family. Then G − a is either
one of eight graphs (see Figure 2 for the complements of these graphs) obtained
by adding an edge to an eight vertex graph or one of seven (Figure 3) that results
from splitting a vertex of an order seven Petersen family graph.
We conclude our proof by examining each of the 15 candidate G − a graphs in
turn. To recover G, we add back the degree six vertex a, which is adjacent to all
but two of the vertices of G − a. So, in the ﬁgures, we label the diﬀerent classes of
vertex, up to symmetry, b, c, etc. In most cases, choosing the two vertices not in

Figure 3. Six (8, 12) graphs formed by splitting a vertex of an
order seven Petersen graph.

N (a) results in a graph G that is not IK because it is 2-apex (Lemma 8) and we’ll
only list the choices of vertex pair that produce an IK graph. Generally, this will
be due to a proper IK minor, but the four cases that result in a MMIK graph are
Figure 2vii (yielding Cousin 12 of the K3,3,1,1 family [GMN]) and viii (E9 + e) as
well as Figure 3i (B9) and iii (Cousin 41 of the K3,3,1,1 family).
If G − a is the graph of Figure 2i, there are ﬁve types of vertices. To get an
IK graph, with proper H8 minor, choose {c, d} or {d, f} as the vertex pair not in
N (a).
If G − a is as in Figure 2ii, there are again ﬁve types of vertices. The only case
that results in an IK graph, with proper H9 minor, is {c, d} ∩ N (a) = ∅.

The graph of Figure 2iii is K4,4 with all vertices symmetric. However, the two
that are not adjacent to a are either in the same part, in which case G is 2-apex,
or in distinct parts, meaning G has a proper H9 minor.

THOMAS W. MATTMAN, CHRIS MORRIS, AND JODY RYKER

There are six types of vertices for the graph of Figure 2iv. Except for the case

where {d, e} ∩ N (a) = ∅, which leads to a proper F9 minor, G will be 2-apex.
There are only two vertices that share the same symmetry type (that of vertex
c) for the graph of Figure 2v. If {d, f} or {f, h} are the pair not in N (a), then G
has a proper H8 minor.
In the case of Figure 2vi, adding back in a results in a 2-apex graph except for
two cases. If {b, e} ∩ N (a) = ∅, there is a proper H8 minor and if it’s d and e that
are avoided, a proper F9 minor results.
For Figure 2vii, there are only four types of vertices. To get an IK graph, use
{b, e} as the avoided pair (which leads to a proper F9 minor), or else the two vertices
of type e. It is this last case that leads to an MMIK graph, Cousin 12 in the K3,3,1,1
family of [GMN].
For the ﬁnal graph of Figure 2, avoiding the two vertices of type d gives an IK
graph that has a proper F9 minor. On the other hand, if {d, e} ∩ N (a) = ∅, we
obtain the MMIK graph E9 + e.
Turning to Figure 3, the complement of graph i will produce a 2-apex graph
unless it’s {e, f} that are not in N (a). In that case, we achieve the MMIK graph
B9.

For Figure 3ii, the result is IK only in the case that a is adjacent to neither
vertex of type e, in which case we have the MMIK graph A9. However, this graph
has ∆(G) seven, and not six as we have been assuming.

The only way to get an IK graph from Figure 3iii, by having a avoid two ver-
tices of type b, gives the MMIK graph denoted Cousin 41 of of the K3,3,1,1 family
in [GMN].
There are three ways to construct an IK graph from Figure 3iv. If {c, e} or {e, f}
are outside of N (a), then G will have a proper H8 minor. On the other hand, if a
is not adjacent to either of the vertices of type f , there will be a proper H9 minor.
The IK graphs obtained from Figure 3v, by avoiding {b, d} or {b, f}, both have
a proper H8 minor.
The G − a whose complement is Figure 3vi is similar. There are two ways to
achieve an IK graph, both with H8 minor: take either {b, d} or the pair of vertices
of type d outside of N (a).
The ﬁnal example, Figure 3vii, can produce IK graphs in a number of ways. If
{b, f} ∩ N (a) = ∅, G has a proper H8 minor. If N (a) avoids any two of d, e, and
(cid:3)
f , then G has a proper F9 minor.

4. Computer Verification for Size 23 through 27

In this section we show that a graph G with |G| = 9 and 23 ≤ (cid:107)G(cid:107) ≤ 27 cannot
be MMIK. We outline two approaches. The ﬁrst is found in the second author’s
thesis [Mo] where he implemented the algorithm in both Ruby and Java languages.
The second is based on a classiﬁcation of MMN2A (minor minimal not 2-apex)
graphs [MP] achieved using Mathematica.
The idea of the ﬁrst approach is to start with a listing of all graphs G with
|G| = 9 and 23 ≤ (cid:107)G(cid:107) ≤ 27 and systematically apply a sequence of six tests to G
in an eﬀort to determine whether or not it is IK. In each case, applying the test to
a graph G produces one of three outcomes: the graph G is IK, the graph G is not
IK, or the status of graph G remains indeterminate.

ORDER NINE MMIK GRAPHS

The ﬁrst three tests are based on basic facts about the order and size of G. By
assuming G of order nine with 23 ≤ (cid:107)G(cid:107) ≤ 27, we’ve already taken these constraints
into consideration and these three tests will leave G indeterminate. A fourth test,
the Minor Of Classiﬁcation, checks if G is a minor of certain well-known MMIK
graphs. However, the implementation only makes use of MMIK graphs on 21 and
22 edges and again will leave our graphs, of size 23 at least, indeterminate.

This leaves only two tests. Fortunately, they are quite eﬀective at sorting our
graphs. The Contains Minor Classiﬁcation checks if G has K7, H8, F9, H9, K3,3,1,1,
A9, or B9 as a minor. If so G is IK. As we are assuming G has at least 23 edges the
found minor is proper and G is not MMIK. The ﬁnal test, Planarity Classiﬁcation,
says G is not IK, hence not MMIK, if it is 2-apex.
In [Mo], the algorithm is applied to all connected graphs of order nine, leaving
only 32 indeterminate graphs with 24 having 23 ≤ (cid:107)G(cid:107) ≤ 27. Four of these are
subgraphs of the graph 260910. Since 260910 has an unknotted embedding (see [R])
these four are not IK. The remaining 20 indeterminate graphs have E9 + e, a 22
edge MMIK graph, as a proper minor and are therefore not MMIK themselves.
A second proof that there is no MMIK order nine graphs with 23 ≤ (cid:107)G(cid:107) ≤ 27
is based on the classiﬁcation of order nine MMN2A graphs. Using Mathematica,
in [MP] the authors show that there are a total of 12 MMN2A graphs through
order nine, including ﬁve each in the K7 and K3,3,1,1 families as well as a (9, 26)
and (9, 27) example; we’ll call them G9,26 and G9,27.

By Lemma 8, a MMIK graph of order nine must have a MMN2A minor. Most
of the 12 MMN2A graphs are in fact MMIK. As shown in [GMN] every graph
in the K3,3,1,1 family is MMIK. Also, all but six of the graphs in the K7 family
are MMIK [GMN, HNTY]. Only one of the six exceptions has order nine or less;
in [GMN] they call that graph E9. So, to show that there are no MMIK graphs of
order nine with 23 ≤ (cid:107)G(cid:107) ≤ 27, it’s enough to prove the following proposition.
Proposition 11. There is no MMIK graph G of order nine with 23 ≤ (cid:107)G(cid:107) ≤ 27
that has E9, G9,26, or G9,27 as a minor.

Proof. The three MMN2A graphs mentioned in the statement, E9, G9,26, and G9,27,
are all of order nine. If G is an order nine MMIK graph with one of these three as
a minor, then G is formed by adding edges.

Up to symmetry, there are two types of edges missing from E9. By adding a
single edge, we either form E9 + e, a MMIK graph of order 22 (see [GMN]), or else
a 22 edge graph with a proper F9 subgraph. To construct G with 23 ≤ (cid:107)G(cid:107) ≤ 27
requires addition of further edges and any such G has either E9 + e or F9 as a
proper minor and is not MMIK.

We can describe G9,26 by its edge list [MP]:

{{1, 4},{1, 5},{1, 7},{1, 8},{1, 9},{2, 5},{2, 6},{2, 7},{2, 8},
{2, 9},{3, 5},{3, 6},{3, 7},{3, 8},{3, 9},{4, 6},{4, 7},{4, 8},

{4, 9},{5, 6},{5, 8},{5, 9},{6, 8},{6, 9},{7, 8},{7, 9}}.

Adding edges {1, 3} and {2, 4} results in the graph G9,28, which is MMIK [GMN].
This means neither G9,26, nor any 27 edge graph formed by adding a single one of
those edges is MMIK or even IK. It remains to investigate adding other edges to
G9,26. Up to symmetry, there are four other possibilities. Adding {2, 3} results in
a graph that is not IK since it is a subgraph of the graph 260910, which has an

10

unknotted embedding (see [R]). Adding {8, 9} or {5, 7} gives a size 27 graph with a
proper A9 minor, while the graph formed by adding {1, 6} has a proper B9 minor.
So, neither G9,26 nor any 27 edge graph formed by adding a single edge is MMIK.
The remaining possibility is that G9,27 itself is MMIK. However, G9,27 is a sub-
graph of the graph 260910 that is shown to have an unknotted embedding in [R].
(cid:3)
Therefore, G9,27 is not IK and also not MMIK.

In summary, we’ve described two diﬀerent arguments that there is no order nine
MMIK graph G with 23 ≤ (cid:107)G(cid:107) ≤ 27. The ﬁrst approach is implemented in two
diﬀerent languages in [Mo]. The second approach instead relies on the classiﬁcation
of order nine MMN2A graphs achieved using Mathematica [MP].
