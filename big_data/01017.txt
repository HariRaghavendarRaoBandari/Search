ABSTRACT
We present an updated version of the spectroscopic catalogue of white dwarf-main
sequence (WDMS) binaries from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We identify
939 WDMS binaries within the data releases (DR) 9–12 of SDSS plus 40 objects
from DR 1–8 that we missed in our previous works, 646 of which are new. The total
number of spectroscopic SDSS WDMS binaries increases to 3294. This is by far the
largest and most homogeneous sample of compact binaries currently available. We
use a decomposition/ﬁtting routine to derive the stellar parameters of all systems
identiﬁed here (white dwarf eﬀective temperatures, surface gravities and masses, and
secondary star spectral types). The analysis of the corresponding stellar parameter
distributions shows that the SDSS WDMS binary population is seriously aﬀected by
selection eﬀects. We also measure the Na I λλ 8183.27, 8194.81 absorption doublet and
Hα emission radial velocities (RV) from all SDSS WDMS binary spectra identiﬁed in
this work. 98 objects are found to display RV variations, 62 of which are new. The RV
data are suﬃcient enough to estimate the orbital periods of three close binaries.

Key words: (stars:) binaries (including multiple): close – stars: low-mass – (stars):
white dwarfs – (stars:) binaries: spectroscopic.

INTRODUCTION

A large fraction of main sequence stars are found in binary
systems (Duquennoy & Mayor 1991; Raghavan et al. 2010;
Yuan et al. 2015a). It is expected that ∼25 per cent of all
main sequence binaries are close enough to begin mass trans-
fer interactions when the more massive star becomes a red
giant or an asymptotic giant star (Willems & Kolb 2004).
This has been observationally veriﬁed e.g. by Farihi et al.
(2010) and by Nebot G´omez-Mor´an et al. (2011). Because
the mass transfer rate generally exceeds the Eddington limit,
the secondary star is not able to accrete the transferred ma-
terial and the system evolves through a common envelope
phase. That is, the core of the giant and the main sequence
companion orbit within a common envelope formed by the
outer layers of the giant star. Drag forces between the two
stars and the envelope lead to the shrinkage of the orbit
and therefore to the release of orbital energy. The orbital

c(cid:13) 2015 RAS

energy is deposited into the envelope and is eventually used
to eject it (Webbink 2008). The outcome of common enve-
lope evolution is hence a close binary formed by the core
of the giant star (which later becomes a white dwarf) and
a main sequence companion, i.e. a close white dwarf-main
sequence (WDMS) binary. These are commonly referred to
as post-common envelope binaries (PCEBs). The remain-
ing ∼75 per cent of main sequence binaries are wide enough
to avoid mass transfer interactions. In these cases the more
massive stars evolve like single stars until they eventually be-
come white dwarfs. The orbital separations of such WDMS
binaries are similar to those of the main sequence binaries
from which they descend.

During the last years we have mined the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS; York et al. 2000) spectroscopic data base
to build up the largest, most homogeneous and complete cat-
alogue of WDMS binaries (Rebassa-Mansergas et al. 2010,
2012a, 2013a), which contains 2316 systems as for data re-

lease (DR) 8. Observational studies led by our team have
resulted in the identiﬁcation of 1050 wide SDSS WDMS
binaries and 206 PCEBs (Rebassa-Mansergas et al. 2007;
Schreiber et al. 2008, 2010; Rebassa-Mansergas et al. 2011),
for which we have measured the orbital period of 90
(Rebassa-Mansergas et al. 2008; Nebot G´omez-Mor´an et al.
2011; Rebassa-Mansergas et al. 2012b).

The analysis of the entire SDSS WDMS binary sam-
ple, as well as the sub-samples of close PCEBs and widely
separated WDMS binaries have led to numerous advances
in several ﬁelds of modern astrophysics. These include
for example: constraining current theories of close com-
pact binary evolution (Zorotovic et al. 2010; Davis et al.
2010; Zorotovic et al.
2011b; Rebassa-Mansergas et al.
2012b); demonstrating in a robust way that the ma-
jority of
low-mass white dwarfs are formed in bina-
ries (Rebassa-Mansergas et al. 2011); constraining the pair-
ing properties of main sequence stars (Ferrario 2012);
providing robust observational evidence for disrupted
constraining
magnetic braking (Schreiber et al. 2010);
the rotation-age-activity relation of
low-mass main se-
quence stars (Rebassa-Mansergas et al. 2013b); studying
the statistical properties of the PCEB population us-
ing Monte Carlo techniques (Toonen & Nelemans 2013;
Camacho et al. 2014; Zorotovic et al. 2014); analysing why
the average mass of white dwarfs in cataclysmic vari-
ables is signiﬁcantly larger than the average mass of sin-
gle white dwarfs (Zorotovic et al. 2011a; Schreiber et al.
2016; Nelemans et al. 2015); testing hierarchical probabilis-
tic models used to infer properties of unseen companions
to low-mass white dwarfs (Andrews et al. 2014); detect-
ing new gravitational wave veriﬁcation sources (Kilic et al.
2014); analysing the interior structural eﬀects of common
envelope evolution on low-mass pulsating white dwarfs
(Hermes et al. 2015). In addition, many eclipsing SDSS
PCEBs have been identiﬁed (Nebot G´omez-Mor´an et al.
2009; Pyrzas et al. 2009, 2012; Parsons et al. 2013, 2015)
which are being used to test theoretical mass-radius rela-
tions of both white dwarfs and low-mass main sequence stars
(Parsons et al. 2012a,b), as well as the existence of circumbi-
nary planets (Zorotovic & Schreiber 2013; Parsons et al.
2014; Marsh et al. 2014).

The motivation of this paper is to update our spectro-
scopic catalogue of SDSS WDMS binaries by searching for
new identiﬁcations within the third survey generation of the
SDSS (SDSS III, Eisenstein et al. 2011) to thus increase the
number of systems available for follow-up studies1.

2 THE SDSS III SURVEY

In this work we search for WDMS binaries within the
i.e. the ninth
spectroscopic data base of the SDSS III,
(SDSS-III Collaboration et al.
tenth (Ahn et al.
2014), eleventh and twelfth (Alam et al. 2015) DRs of the
SDSS. In particular, we mined the optical (R ∼2000) spectra

2012),

1 The SDSS DR 8 contains the ﬁrst set of spectra observed by
SDSS III, which are not considered here because we have already
identiﬁed WDMS binaries within this DR. Thus, in this paper we
will consider SDSS III as all data collected from DR 9 to DR 12.

obtained by the Sloan Exploration of Galactic Understand-
ing and Evolution 2 survey (SEGUE-2; C. Rockosi et al.
2015, in preparation) and the Baryon Oscillation Spectro-
scopic Survey (BOSS; Dawson et al. 2013).

BOSS uses a new set of spectrographs with 1000 ﬁbres
available per exposure. The main goal of the survey is to
obtain spectra for galaxies and quasars selected from the
SDSS imaging data to study the baryon oscillation feature
in the clustering of galaxies and Lyman-α absorption along
the line of sight to distant quasars. BOSS uses a diﬀerent tar-
get selection criteria for targeting quasars (Ross et al. 2012)
than the one employed by the SDSS I/II surveys. Thus,
whilst SDSS I/II targeted objects with i < 19.1, BOSS went
down to g < 22.0 in order to give a signiﬁcantly higher sur-
face density of targets than in SDSS I/II (Ross et al. 2012).
BOSS has obtained a total number of 4,571,520 spectra. Be-
cause WDMS binaries and quasars overlap in colour space
(Smolˇci´c et al. 2004), we expect a large number of WDMS
binaries being (most likely accidentally) observed by the
BOSS survey. SEGUE-2 used the SDSS I/II spectrographs
to obtain spectra of stars at high and low Galactic latitudes
to study Galactic structure, dynamics, and stellar popula-
tions. SEGUE-2 gathered a total of 155,520 spectra.

3 IDENTIFICATION OF WDMS BINARIES

In Rebassa-Mansergas et al. (2010) we developed a routine
based on reduced χ2 and signal-to-noise (SN) ratio con-
straints (χ2-SN method hereafter) to identify spectroscopic
SDSS WDMS binaries. As in our previous works, we use this
method here for identifying WDMS binaries observed by the
SDSS III survey.

In a ﬁrst step we χ2-ﬁt all SDSS III spectra with a
grid of 163 WDMS binary templates covering a wide range

c(cid:13) 2015 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–??

of white dwarf eﬀective temperatures (6000–100000 K) and
surface gravities (6.5–9.5 dex), and secondary star M-dwarf
spectral types (M0–M9)2 and represent the reduced χ2 val-
ues as a function of SN ratio for each template. We then
deﬁne an equation of the form

Table 1. Number of WDMS binary spectra we have identiﬁed or
studied (ﬁrst column), number of WDMS binary spectra added
to the SDSS III sample identiﬁed in this work (second column)
and total number of SDSS III WDMS binary spectra. In brackets
we give the number of WDMS binary candidate spectra.

and consider as WDMS binary candidates all objects be-
low this curve (χ2

parameters deﬁned for each template and χ2
spec is the χ2
that results from ﬁtting a considered spectrum with a
given template (see Rebassa-Mansergas et al. 2010 for a
complete description of the method). The form of Eq. (1)
is deﬁned to account for systematic errors between tem-
plate and observed spectra, which become more important
the larger the SN ratio is. This exercise resulted in 9,593
WDMS binary candidate spectra which were visually in-
spected. We also inspected their SDSS images for morpho-
logical problems and made use of the GALEX ultraviolet
(Martin et al. 2005; Morrissey et al. 2005) and UKIDSS in-
frared (Dye et al. 2006; Hewett et al. 2006; Lawrence et al.
2007) magnitudes to probe for the presence of excess ﬂux at
the blue and red ends of the SDSS spectra, respectively.

We found 872 of the 9,593 selected spectra to be genuine
WDMS binaries and we considered 47 spectra as WDMS bi-
nary candidates. In what follows, we ﬂag an object to be
a WDMS binary candidate when the spectrum is that of a
white dwarf (main sequence star) displaying some red (blue)
ﬂux excess which cannot be conﬁrmed to arise from a com-
panion due to the lack of GALEX (UKIDSS) magnitudes.
The above outlined χ2-SN method has been proven to
be very eﬃcient at identifying WDMS binaries, achieving a
completeness (deﬁned as the ratio between the number of
SDSS WDMS binary spectra we have successfully identiﬁed
and the total number of SDSS WDMS binary spectra ob-
served) around 96 per cent (Rebassa-Mansergas et al. 2010,
2012a, 2013a). However, it is important to keep in mind that
the limiting magnitude of the quasar survey has been mod-
iﬁed from i <19.1 in SDSS I/II to g <22 in SDSS III. We
therefore expect a considerable fraction of SDSS III WDMS
binary spectra to generally be of lower SN ratio than those
from SDSS I/II. Low SN ratio spectra (. 5) are challenging
to classify for any method, including our χ2-SN routine.

Ren et al. (2014) developed an independent strategy
based on the wavelet transform (WT, e.g. Chui 1992)
that proved to be eﬃcient at identifying such low SN ra-
tio WDMS binary spectra. Ren et al. (2014) searched for
WDMS binaries among spectra obtained as part of the
LAMOST (Large Aperture Multi-Object Spectroscopy Tele-
scope) surveys (Cui et al. 2012; Luo et al. 2012; Liu et al.
2014; Yuan et al. 2015b). The analysis unit of the WT is the
local ﬂux of the spectrum, i.e. the selected spectral features.
Thus, for a given spectrum, the WT recognizes the spectral
features rather than the global continuum. The WT decom-
poses the considered features of a given spectrum into ap-
proximation signals, also referred to as approximation coeﬃ-
cients. The wavelength values under the considered spectral

contains a considerably larger fraction of low (65) SN spectra.

regions where the WT is applied are converted into “data
points”. The outcome of a WT can be considered, for com-
parative purposes, as a smooth version of the spectrum. The
WT is therefore a suitable method to identify spectral fea-
tures among low-SN ratio spectra, and we adopt it here to
complement our search of SDSS III WDMS binaries.

We applied the WT to the following spectral regions:
the 3910-4422˚A range thus covering the Balmer lines typi-
cal of hydrogen-rich (DA) white dwarfs, and the 6800-8496˚A
range which samples a large number of TiO and VO molec-
ular bands typical of low-mass main sequence stars. This
choice implies that our WT routine is most eﬃcient at iden-
tifying WDMS binaries containing DA white dwarfs, by far
the most common among white dwarfs. Once we applied the
WT to all SDSS III spectra, WDMS binaries could be easily
selected by applying a number of cuts to the approxima-
tion coeﬃcients and data points obtained for each spectrum
(see Eqs. (1) & (2) of Ren et al. 2014). Applying the WT
and aforementioned cuts to all SDSS III spectra resulted in
36,543 selected spectra. We visually inspected the spectra

method is more eﬃcient at ﬁnding WDMS binaries in which one

and found 1,072 of these to be genuine WDMS binaries, and
30 to be WDMS binary candidates.

4 THE SDSS SPECTROSCOPIC CATALOGUE

OF WDMS BINARIES

Here we quantify the total number of SDSS III WDMS bi-
nary spectra we identiﬁed in the previous section and deter-
mine how many of these objects are new additions to our
latest SDSS DR 8 WDMS binary catalogue. We also esti-
mate the completeness of our SDSS III WDMS binary sam-
ple and compare our catalogue to previously published lists
of SDSS III WDMS binaries. Finally, we provide the total
number of systems that form the spectroscopic catalogue of
SDSS WDMS binaries.

4.1 The SDSS III WDMS binary sample

As explained above, 872 and 47 SDSS III WDMS binary
and candidate spectra respectively have been identiﬁed fol-
lowing the χ2-SN ratio method. Also, 1,072 and 30 WDMS
binary and candidate spectra were identiﬁed following the
WT method (see Table 1). Whilst 670 (10 candidates) are
systems commonly identiﬁed by both methods, 202 (37 can-
didates) and 402 (20 candidates) are independently found by
the χ2-SN ratio and the WT routines, respectively (see Fig-
ure 1, top panel). This brings the total number of SDSS III
WDMS binary and candidate spectra we have identiﬁed to
1,274 and 67, respectively (Table 1).

Inspection of the numbers outlined above reveals that

the χ2-SN ratio method has identiﬁed only ∼68 per cent
of our total number of SDSS III WDMS binary spectra and
that the WT method has successfully identiﬁed ∼84 per
cent of the total number. That is, the WDMS binary sam-
ples identiﬁed by the χ2-SN and the WT methods are ∼68
and ∼84 per cent complete, respectively (the completeness
of the overall sample is derived in the next section). Whilst
the ∼84 per cent of WDMS binary spectra found by the WT
method is in agreement with the results of Ren et al. (2014)
— they estimate a completeness of ∼90 per cent — the ∼68
per cent of WDMS binary spectra identiﬁed by the χ2-SN
ratio method is considerably lower than the ∼ 96 per cent
determined in our previous works (Rebassa-Mansergas et al.
2010, 2012a, 2013a). As we show in Figure 2, this seems to
be simply a consequence of SDSS III WDMS binary spectra
being generally of lower SN ratio due to the limiting magni-
tude of the BOSS quasar survey (Ross et al. 2012). Indeed,
we investigated the 402 WDMS binary spectra the χ2-SN
ratio method failed to identify and found that 81 per cent of
them are of SN65. If we consider only WDMS binary spec-
tra of SN ratio above 5, i.e. a total of 876 spectra, then the
χ2-SN and WT methods successfully identify 800 and 677
spectra, respectively, 601 in common (see Figure 1, bottom
panel). That is, ∼91 and ∼77 per cent of the total number
of WDMS binary spectra with SN ratio >5. This implies
the WT method is considerably more eﬃcient at identify-
ing WDMS binary spectra of low SN ratio. We also visually
inspected the list of spectra the WT methods failed to iden-
tify and found that it mostly contained WDMS binaries in
which the ﬂux of one of the two components dominates the
spectrum. Therefore, we conclude that the χ2-SN ratio and
WT methods eﬃciently complement each other for identi-
fying WDMS binaries within SDSS III. In Figure 3 we show
a few examples of WDMS binary spectra identiﬁed only by
the χ2-SN ratio method and only by the WT method. In the
following section we analyse the completeness of the entire
SDSS III WDMS binary sample.

4.2 Completeness of the SDSS III WDMS binary

sample

Using the χ2-SN and WT methods we have identiﬁed a total
of 1,274 and 67 SDSS III WDMS binary and candidate spec-
tra (Table 1). Here, we analyse how complete this sample is.
WDMS binaries deﬁne a clear region in the u −
g vs g − r colour-colour diagram (Smolˇci´c et al. 2004)
and can be selected via the colour cuts provided by
Rebassa-Mansergas et al. (2013a, see also Figure 4):

+12.38 × (g − r)3 + 3.08 × (g − r)4
+16.67 × (g − r)6

(u − g) < 0.93 − 0.27 × (g − r) − 4.7 × (g − r)2
− 22.19 × (g − r)5
− 3.89 × (g − r)7,
(u − g) > −0.6,

−0.5 < (g − r) < 1.3

(4)

Obviously, the eﬃciency of the above colour cuts in se-
lecting WDMS binaries relies on the accuracy of the SDSS
photometry. This is diﬃcult to achieve in cases where the
two components are partially resolved (blended) in the SDSS
images, when the systems are too faint so that their mag-
nitudes are associated to large uncertainties, and/or when

one of the the two stars outshines its companion. This results
in ∼15 per cent of the SDSS III WDMS binaries identiﬁed
by the χ2-SN and WT methods to fall outside the colour
cuts (see Figure 4). However, it has to be stressed that the
colour selection can be used to test the completeness of our
spectroscopic sample, as visual inspection of all sources with
available SDSS spectra satisfying the cuts would result in a
WDMS binary sample that is 100 per cent complete (within
the colour selection). We hence used the casjobs interface
to select all spectroscopic point sources with clean photom-
etry satisfying the cuts. This resulted in 1,264,475 objects
among 7,121,388 photometric sources. Excluding all targets
with spectroscopic redshifts below 0.05 (to thus avoid quasar
contamination) we ended up with 50,691 SDSS III selected
objects (in this exercise we did not take into account all
spectra contained in the DR 8 or earlier SDSS releases). We
visually inspected the spectra and identiﬁed 933 (26) WDMS
binary (candidate) spectra (Table 1). Of these, only 30 (4)
spectra were not included in our list of systems identiﬁed by
the χ2-SN and WT methods. Visual inspection of the spec-
tra we failed to identify revealed that, in most of the cases,

c(cid:13) 2015 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–??

one of the two binary components dominates the spectral
energy distribution. This exercise strongly suggests that our
SDSS III WDMS binary sample is highly complete (≃96 per
cent) and that the WDMS binary spectra we miss are likely
dominated by the ﬂux of one of the binary components. We
include the 34 missed spectra in our sample and thus in-
crease the number of SDSS III WDMS binary and candidate
spectra to 1,304 and 71, respectively (Table 1).

It is important to emphasise that, although our spec-
troscopic sample is highly complete, the population of SDSS
WDMS binaries does not represent the real and unbiased
population of WDMS binaries. First, there exists an intrin-
sic binary bias that allows us to detect only those objects
displaying both components in the SDSS spectra. We stud-
ied this issue in detail in Camacho et al. (2014) so we here
provide in Table 2 the combination of stellar parameters and
ﬂux ratios that allow the detection of the two components
in the SDSS spectra. Second, the majority of SDSS WDMS
binaries have been observed simply because they have sim-
ilar colours to those of quasars. This eﬀect is clearly visible
in Figure 4, where there is a clear scarcity of WDMS sys-

and quasars (green solid dots) in the u − g vs. g − r colour plane.
Colour cuts for WDMS binaries are given as solid red lines. ∼15
per cent of all WDMS binaries fall outside the colour selection
mainly due to the large photometric uncertainties.

SDSS objects with available spectroscopy (F=Nspec/Nphot, rang-

objects with available spectra and the number of SDSS photo-
metric point sources, respectively). As expected, the fraction is
the highest in quasar dominated areas. Bottom panel: density

tems with g − r > 0.5 colours, and also in Figure 5 (top
panel), where we show a density map illustrating the frac-
tion of SDSS objects with available spectra. This implies the
majority of spectroscopic SDSS WDMS binaries generally
contain hot white dwarfs (see further details in Section 6).

4.3 Comparison with Li et al. (2014)

Li et al. (2014) provided a list of 227 DR 9 WDMS bina-

ries, of which 148 (1) are included in our WDMS binary
(candidate) list. Of the remaining 78, 70 spectra are not
considered as WDMS binaries by us (the majority are main
sequence plus main sequence superpositions and also some
single white dwarfs), and 5 (3) are WDMS binary (candi-
date) spectra that we missed. This implies we have success-
fully identiﬁed ∼95 per cent of the total WDMS binary sam-
ple of Li et al. (2014). The missed spectra are dominated by
the ﬂux emission of one of the two components and we in-
clude them in our lists, thus raising the number of SDSS III
WDMS binary and candidate spectra to 1,309 and 74, re-
spectively (Table 1). We also note that our list contains 447
WDMS binary spectra that are part of SDSS DR 9 which
are not included in the catalogue of Li et al. (2014). This
indicates that our routines are much more eﬃcient at identi-
fying SDSS WDMS binaries, and that the catalogue of SDSS
WDMS binaries by Li et al. (2014) is highly incomplete.

Li et al. (2014) provide eﬀective temperatures, surface
gravities and masses for the white dwarfs in their WDMS
binary sample. As we also do, they derive these parameters
ﬁtting the white dwarf spectra with the 1D white dwarf
model grid of Koester (2010). However, they do not apply
3D corrections to avoid the so-called log g problem at low
eﬀective temperatures (see further details in Section 5).

4.4 Comparison with Kepler et al. (2015) and

Kepler et al. (2016)

An additional list of 177 DR 9-10 SDSS WDMS binary spec-
tra has been provided by Kepler et al. (2015). 153 (2) of
these are included in our WDMS binary (candidate) list, we
only missed 5 (4) WDMS binary (candidate) spectra (Ta-
ble 1), the majority dominated by the ﬂux contribution of
the white dwarf. We classify the remaining 13 spectra as sin-
gle white dwarfs or main sequence plus main sequence su-
perpositions. Hence, we have successfully identiﬁed ∼94 per
cent of the total sample provided by Kepler et al. (2015).
We include the 9 missed objects in our lists and increase to
1,314 and 78 the number of WDMS binary and candidate
spectra, respectively (Table 1). Moreover, we note that we
have identiﬁed 759 DR 9-10 WDMS binary spectra that are
not included in the list of Kepler et al. (2015). The fact that
Kepler et al. (2015) missed this large number of WDMS bi-
nary spectra is not too surprising, as their main focus was
to identify single white dwarfs.

Kepler et al. (2016) presented an updated SDSS white
dwarf catalogue from DR 12, which includes 160 new WDMS
binary spectra. 123 of these are included in our lists, 122 as
genuine WDMS binaries and 1 as a candidate (Table 1). The
remaining 37 spectra include 5 (1) WDMS binaries (can-
didate) that we missed and 31 objects that we classify as
either single white dwarfs, cataclysmic variables or unclassi-
ﬁed. Thus, we have identiﬁed ∼95 per cent of WDMS binary
sample provided by Kepler et al. (2016). We include the 6
missed objects in our lists thus increasing to 1,319 and 79
the number of WDMS binary and candidate spectra, respec-
tively (Table 1). We also note that our catalogue contains
337 DR 12 WDMS binary spectra that Kepler et al. (2016)
did not identify.

spectral types for the WDMS binaries observed by the BOSS, SEGUE-2, SEGUE and Legacy surveys of SDSS. Given that WDMS
binaries can be observed by more than one survey, we consider them to be part of as many samples as diﬀerent surveys have observed
them. In the bottom panels we provide the distributions for the entire (All) spectroscopic catalogue of SDSS DR 12 WDMS binaries. In
this case WDMS binaries that are observed by more than one survey are only considered once. We also provide the number of systems
per distribution in each panel.

4.5 Comparison with Gentile Fusillo et al. (2015)

Gentile Fusillo et al. (2015) developed a method which uses
cuts in colour-colour and reduced proper motion-colour
space to select ∼23 000 high-ﬁdelity white dwarf candidates.
Among the 8,701 of them with available spectra, they clas-
siﬁed 98 as WDMS binaries, of which 91 are included in
our WDMS binary catalogue. The remaining 7 include 2
WDMS binaries that we missed clearly dominated by the
ﬂux contribution of the white dwarfs and 5 objects that we
classify as single white dwarfs or cataclysmic variables. We
thus have identiﬁed 99 per cent of the WDMS binary sam-
ple of Gentile Fusillo et al. (2015). We include the 2 missed
objects in our list and thus raise to 1,321 and 79 the num-
ber of WDMS binary and candidate spectra, respectively
(Table 1).

4.6 Applying the WT method to DR 8 spectra

We have shown that the WT is more eﬃcient than the
χ2-SN method at identifying SDSS WDMS binaries of low
SN ratio spectra (Section 3). It is therefore plausible that

8

A. Rebassa-Mansergas et al.

Rebassa-Mansergas et al. (2010, 2012a, 2013a) missed a
fraction of low SN ratio SDSS I/II WDMS binary spectra.
In order to investigate this we applied the WT as speci-
ﬁed in Section 3 to all SDSS DR 8 spectra, which resulted
in 20,060 selected candidates. We found 1,852 to be genuine
WDMS binaries and 13 are considered as WDMS binary
candidates. Only the 12 candidate spectra and 46 WDMS
binary spectra are not included in our SDSS WDMS binary
catalogue (Table 1) — ∼3 per cent of the total identiﬁed
sample (Rebassa-Mansergas et al. 2013a).

4.7 The ﬁnal number of spectroscopic SDSS

WDMS binaries

In the previous sections we have identiﬁed a total of 1,367
(91) WDMS binary (candidate) spectra (Table 1). We cross-
correlate this list with our latest catalogue of 2,316 DR 8
WDMS binaries (Rebassa-Mansergas et al. 2013a) and ﬁnd
979 new systems, 647 of which have not been published
before (Table 3). Thus, the total number of spectroscopic
SDSS WDMS binaries raises to 3,295, i.e. an increase of ∼40
per cent. We have updated our web site http://www.sdss-
wdms.org including the new systems and spectra identiﬁed
in this work. The object names, coordinates and ugriz mag-
nitudes of the SDSS WDMS binaries found in this work are
also available in the electronic edition of the paper.

5 STELLAR PARAMETERS

We here derive white dwarf eﬀective temperatures, surface
gravities and masses, and secondary star spectral types
for all WDMS binaries identiﬁed in this work. To that
end we use the decomposition/ﬁtting routine outlined by
Rebassa-Mansergas et al. (2007). We ﬁrst use a combined
set of observed M dwarf and white dwarf templates to ﬁt a
given SDSS WDMS binary spectrum and record the spec-
tral type of the secondary star. We then subtract the best-
ﬁt M dwarf template and ﬁt the normalized Balmer lines
of the residual white dwarf spectrum with a model grid
of DA white dwarfs (Koester 2010) to derive the eﬀective
temperature and surface gravity. The Balmer line ﬁtting is
subject to a “cold/hot” solution degeneracy, which is bro-
ken ﬁtting the entire spectrum (continuum plus lines) with
the same grid of model spectra (note that the continuum is
most sensitive to the eﬀective temperature). Given that 1D
white dwarf model spectra such as those used in this work
yield overestimated surface gravity values for white dwarfs of
eﬀective temperatures below ∼12000 K (e.g. Koester et al.
2009; Tremblay et al. 2011), we apply the 3D corrections of
Tremblay et al. (2013) to our eﬀective temperature and sur-
face gravity determinations (we apply the 3D corrections to
all SDSS WDMS binaries we identiﬁed in previous works
too, as these corrections were not available at that time).
We then interpolate these values in the updated cooling se-
quences of Bergeron et al. (1995) and derive white dwarf
masses. For the sake of comparison, we also derive the white
dwarf masses using the models of Renedo et al. (2010) and
ﬁnd no substantial diﬀerence between the values obtained
from the two cooling sequences. The SDSS spectra of the
WDMS binaries for which we cannot obtain stellar param-
eters are either too noisy and/or are dominated by the ﬂux

Figure 7. Cumulative distributions of white dwarf eﬀective tem-
perature (top left), mass (bottom left), surface gravity (top right)
and secondary star spectral type (bottom right) for the BOSS,
SEGUE-2, Legacy and SEGUE WDMS binary populations.

from one of the two stellar components. In cases where more
than one spectrum per target is available we average the cor-
responding parameter values. The white dwarf eﬀective tem-
peratures, surface gravities and masses, and secondary star
spectral types that result from ﬁtting spectra of the same
targets are found to agree at the 1.5σ level in 53, 64, 67 and
89 per cent of the cases, respectively. The stellar parameters
are accessible via our web site http://www.sdss-wdms.org.

The parameter distributions are shown Fig. 6, where we
divide the sample into BOSS (top panels) and SEGUE-2
(second top panels) WDMS binaries. In the distributions
we only consider white dwarf eﬀective temperatures with
a relative error under 10 per cent, and white dwarf sur-
face gravities and masses of absolute errors under 0.075 M⊙
and 0.075 dex, respectively. For completeness, in the mid-
bottom panels of the same Figure we also provide the param-
eter distributions of SDSS I/II WDMS binaries, where these
are divided into objects that were observed by the Legacy
(Adelman-McCarthy et al. 2008; Abazajian et al. 2009) sur-
vey of quasars and galaxies (hereafter Legacy WDMS bina-
ries) and objects that were observed as part of our ded-
icated SEGUE (the SDSS Extension for Galactic Under-
standing and Exploration, Yanny et al. 2009) survey for tar-
geting objects containing cool white dwarfs and early type
companions (Rebassa-Mansergas et al. 2012a). We restrict
the Legacy and SEGUE samples by the same error param-
eter cuts as above outlined. It is also important to mention
that we do not exclude duplicated targets that have been
observed by diﬀerent surveys. Thus, for example, a given
WDMS binary is part of both the SEGUE and BOSS pop-
ulations if it has been independently observed by both sur-
veys. Finally, in the bottom panel of Figure 6 we provide the
parameter distributions of the entire spectroscopic catalogue
of SDSS DR 12 WDMS binaries, i.e. the sum of all WDMS
binary sub-samples. In this case we do exclude duplicated
targets that have been observed by diﬀerent surveys. In the
following section we compare the diﬀerent SDSS WDMS bi-
nary populations.

6 A COMPARISON OF THE DIFFERENT

SDSS WDMS BINARY POPULATIONS

SDSS WDMS binaries come in diﬀerent ﬂavours. On the one
hand, the majority of WDMS binaries are observed by SDSS
simply because they have similar colours as quasars. These
WDMS binaries include objects observed by the Legacy sur-
vey of SDSS I/II and objects observed by the BOSS survey of
SDSS III. On the other hand, as can be seen in Figure 6, a
small number of WDMS binaries have been also observed
by the SEGUE-2 survey of SDSS III. Finally, SDSS I/II
WDMS binaries were additionally observed as part of our
dedicated SEGUE survey (Rebassa-Mansergas et al. 2012a).
Here we compare these diﬀerent SDSS WDMS binary popu-
lations. The stellar parameter cumulative distributions of
white dwarf eﬀective temperatures, surface gravities and
masses, and secondary star spectral types for the diﬀerent
WDMS binary populations are shown in Figure 7.

We run Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests to quantita-
tively compare the cumulative distributions (a χ2 test in
the case of the secondary star spectral types). The results
are provided in Table 4. The probabilities are in most cases
very low, thus indicating that the WDMS binaries of the
four sub-samples are drawn from diﬀerent parent popula-
tions. Indeed, there are no two sub-samples for which the
obtained probabilities are above 15 per cent in all four cases
(white dwarf eﬀective temperature, mass, surface gravity
and secondary star spectral type). The fact that the four
sub-samples seem to be statistically diﬀerent is not too sur-
prising and clearly indicates that the SDSS WDMS binary
catalogue is heavily aﬀected by selection eﬀects of the dif-
ferent populations.

Legacy and BOSS WDMS binaries are most likely acci-
dentally selected by the target selection algorithm of quasars
and, in principle, we may expect these populations to be sta-
tistically similar. However, as we have already mentioned,
the quasar selection algorithm has modiﬁed the limiting
magnitude from i <19.1 in SDSS I/II to g <22 in SDSS III
(Ross et al. 2012). Intrinsically faint WDMS binaries con-
taining late-type companions and/or cool/high-mass white

dwarfs are therefore more likely to be observed by the BOSS
survey than the Legacy survey. Thus, the BOSS WDMS
binary population displays a scarcity of low-mass (MWD.
0.5M⊙) as well as a higher fraction of cooler (.15000 K)
white dwarfs than the Legacy one (Figure 6). Moreover, the
secondary star spectral type distribution of BOSS WDMS
binaries presents a clear overabundance of late-type (>M6)
companions as compared to the spectral type distribution
of Legacy WDMS binaries. This result suggests that the
observed overall scarcity of SDSS WDMS binaries contain-
ing late-type companions (bottom right panel of Figure 6)
is a simple consequence of selection eﬀects incorporated by
the SDSS selection criteria rather than an intrinsic physical
property of these binaries.

SEGUE WDMS binaries were observed thanks to
a dedicated survey performed by us
to select ob-
jects with a strong contribution of the companion star
(Rebassa-Mansergas et al. 2012a), hence they present sta-
tistical properties that are diﬀerent from the other sub-
samples. Interestingly, white dwarfs of both SEGUE and
SEGUE-2 WDMS binaries seem to be of similar properties
in terms of white dwarf mass and surface gravity (Table 4),
although the number of SEGUE-2 systems is too low and
these similarities need to be taken with caution.

SEGUE-2 WDMS binaries are selected as the result of
a selection algorithm that aims at obtaining spectra of main
sequence stars and red giants. The colours of WDMS bina-
ries are similar to those of single main sequence stars only
when the ﬂux contribution of the white dwarf is small, i.e.
the white dwarfs are expected to be cool and/or massive.
Indeed, the white dwarf population of SEGUE-2 WDMS bi-
naries is the coolest among the four sub-samples and the
masses of 1/3 of the white dwarfs are >0.8 M⊙(Figure 6).
The secondary stars that are part of SEGUE-2 WDMS bi-
naries seem to be of similar properties to those of the Legacy
sample (Table 4).

7 RADIAL VELOCITIES AND

IDENTIFICATION OF PCEBS

We here measure the Na I λλ 8183.27, 8194.81 absorption
doublet and Hα emission radial velocities (RV) from all
SDSS WDMS binary spectra identiﬁed in this work. We
analyse these RVs to detect close binaries, i.e. PCEBs, in
our sample. That is, an object is considered to be a PCEB
if we detect signiﬁcant (more than 3σ) RV variation. If we
do not detect RV variation we consider the system as a likely
wide binary, as the probability exists for the RVs to sample
the same orbital phase of a PCEB, in which case we would
not detect RV variation (note also that low-inclination and
long orbital period PCEBs are more diﬃcult to identify).

We ﬁt the Na I λλ 8183.27,8194.81 absorption doublet
with a second order polynomial plus a double-Gaussian line
proﬁle of ﬁxed separation, and the Hα emission line with
a second order polynomial plus a single-Gaussian line pro-
ﬁle, as described in Rebassa-Mansergas et al. (2008) and
Ren et al. (2013). Each SDSS spectrum is the result of com-
bining several diﬀerent exposures (hereafter sub-spectra),
hence we measure the RVs from all available sub-spectra
to thus increase the chances of detecting short orbital pe-
riod PCEBs. However, we need to keep in mind that a large

fraction of WDMS binaries found in this work are observed
by the BOSS survey of SDSS and that their spectra are
generally of low SN ratio (Figure 2). Therefore, we expect a
large fraction of BOSS WDMS binary sub-spectra to be of
extremely low SN ratio and hence not suitable for measuring
accurate RVs. Thus, we decide to measure the RVs from all
combined spectra too. Measuring RVs from combined spec-
tra has the main eﬀect of decreasing the sensitivity to RV
variations of very short orbital period PCEBs due to aver-
aging out some orbital phase information.

We derive at least one Na I λλ 8183.27, 8194.81 absorp-
tion doublet and Hα emission RV of an accuracy better than
20 km s−1 for 536 and 291 WDMS binaries, respectively.
Since many of these WDMS binaries are not new identiﬁca-
tions, we combine the RVs measured here to those available
from our previous studies to analyse the number of close bi-
naries, i.e. PCEBs, in the sample. We thus count 390 and 224
WDMS binaries with at least two available Na I and/or two
available Hα RV measurements respectively, among which
we detect 73 objects displaying more than 3σ Na I RV vari-
ation and 66 systems displaying more than 3σ Hα RV vari-
ation. If we only take into account systems with RVs taken
on diﬀerent nights3 we derive a PCEB fraction of ∼27 per
cent based on our Na I RV measurements, or ∼40 per cent
based on our Hα RV measurements. Whilst the former value
is in agreement with the close binary fraction found by
Nebot G´omez-Mor´an et al. (2011) of 21-24 per cent, the lat-
ter seems to be rather overestimated. This is a consequence
of Hα RVs being less robust as probe for RV variations most
likely due to magnetic activity aﬀecting the secondary stars,
i.e. the M dwarfs may be relatively rapidly rotating for the
Hα emission to be patchy over their surface thus resulting
in apparent RV variations (Rebassa-Mansergas et al. 2008).
Hence, caution needs to be taken with those PCEBs display-

3 230 WDMS binaries have at least two available Na I RVs taken
on diﬀerent nights, of which 62 display more than 3σ RV variation.
127 objects have at least two available Hα emission RVs taken on
diﬀerent nights, of which 51 display more than 3σ RV variation.

RV variations measured from the Na I absorption doublet in
SDSSJ073455.91+410537.4 and SDSSJ102438.46+162458.2 and
from the Hα emission line in SDSSJ125645.47+252241.6. The

ing only Hα emission RV variation. Two obvious exceptions
here are SDSSJ093947.95+325807.3, which is found to be
an eclipser (see Section 8), and SDSSJ125645.47+252241.6,
for which we estimate its orbital period based on the Hα
RVs (see below). Excluding duplicate binaries that display
both Na I and Hα RV variation we end up with 98 unique
PCEBs, of which 62 are new identiﬁcations. In Table 5 we
provide the IAU names of the 62 new PCEBs.

We ﬁnally combine the RV information presented

SDSS PCEBs and analyse the Scargle (1982) periodograms
calculated from the RVs of each system to investigate
the periodic nature of the RV variations. In three cases

SDSSJ102438.46+162458.2
and SDSSJ125645.47+252241.6) we are able to estimate
the orbital periods based on the resulting periodograms
(see left panels of Figure 8). We adopt the orbital periods
as the values corresponding to the highest power in the
periodograms and we then carry out sine-ﬁts of the form

8 ECLIPSING WDMS BINARIES

In this ﬁnal section we search for eclipsing WDMS bi-
naries using photometry from the Catalina Sky Survey
(CSS) and Catalina Real Time Transient Survey (CRTS;
Drake et al. 2009). We followed the same approach de-
tailed in Parsons et al. (2013) and Parsons et al. (2015)
whereby we selected all WDMS binaries with magnitudes
of r < 19 and re-reduced the raw CSS data ourselves to
more easily identify very deeply eclipsing systems and
remove any contaminated exposures. Out of the 1,177 and
91 WDMS binaries and candidates identiﬁed here, only
314 were bright enough and with suﬃcient coverage to
search for eclipses, i.e. a fraction of ∼25 per cent. This
low percentage is mainly due to the fact that a large
fraction of the WDMS binaries identiﬁed in this work
were observed by the BOSS survey of SDSS of limiting
magnitude g < 22.0. That is, many WDMS binaries do
not survive the r < 19 cut we applied. We identiﬁed seven
eclipsing systems, however all of these were previously
known: SDSSJ011009.14+132615.66 (Pyrzas et al. 2009),
SDSSJ093947.92+325807.59, SDSSJ095719.24+234240.69,
SDSSJ141057.72-020236.48,
SDSSJ142355.06+240924.43,
SDSSJ145634.25+161138.11
and
(Drake et al.
SDSSJ141536.38+011718.59 (Green et al. 1978). We also
discovered that SDSSJ074244.91+421426.17 is in fact a
MS+MS eclipsing binary as revealed by a deep secondary
eclipse and thus exclude it from our list. Hence, the total
number of SDSS WDMS binaries is 3294, 646 of which are
new. The number of eclipsing systems among our sample is
consistent with previous results indicating that ∼10 per cent
of PCEBs — which make up roughly one fourth of WDMS
binaries (Schreiber et al. 2010; Rebassa-Mansergas et al.
2011; Nebot G´omez-Mor´an et al. 2011) — are eclipsing
systems (Parsons et al. 2013).

The spectroscopic catalogue of SDSS WDMS binaries now
contains 3294 systems from DR 12. 979 are additions from
the here presented work, 646 of which have not been pub-
lished before. This is by far the largest, most complete and
most homogeneous catalogue of compact binaries currently
available. We have provided stellar parameters (white dwarf
eﬀective temperatures, surface gravities and masses, and sec-
ondary star spectral types) and RVs for the here identiﬁed
WDMS binaries. We have also applied 3D corrections to the
derived white dwarf parameters of all SDSS WDMS bina-
ries. The stellar parameter distributions corresponding to
WDMS binaries observed by the diﬀerent surveys of SDSS
(Legacy, BOSS, SEGUE, SEGUE-2) are statistically diﬀer-
ent due to the diﬀerent target selection criteria used. This
clearly reveals that the SDSS WDMS binary sample, though
being the largest, is heavily aﬀected by selection eﬀects. In
particular, we ﬁnd indications for these selection eﬀects to be
responsible for the overall scarcity of observed SDSS WDMS
binaries containing late type (>M6) companions. The RVs
of 98 of our here studied SDSS WDMS binaries (62 of which
are new identiﬁcations) display signiﬁcant variation and we
ﬂag these systems as close binaries. For three of them the RV
data are suﬃcient to estimate their orbital periods. We have
also identiﬁed seven WDMS binaries as eclipsing, although
all of them have been published before.

The SDSS WDMS binary catalogue is a superb sample
that is being used to tackle many diﬀerent open problems
in modern astrophysics, ranging from constraining the phys-
ical properties of low-mass main sequence stars and white
dwarfs to improving our understanding of close compact bi-
nary evolution, among others.

(Section 7). However, they were ﬂagged as wide WDMS
binaries in our previous studies (Schreiber et al. 2010;
Rebassa-Mansergas et al. 2011). This may indicate that
these binaries have relatively long orbital periods of a few
hundred of days (as the spectra analysed in this work are
separated by this amount of time from the spectra analysed
in our previous studies), or simply that our previous RV
measurements sampled always the same orbital phases.

The SDSS spectra and ugriz ﬂuxes derived from SDSS

u-band ﬂuxes (also the z-band ﬂux for SDSSJ0839) do not
match the spectra. We consider this may be a consequence
of the SDSS photometry being obtained during eclipses,
i.e. the u-band photometry correspond to that of the main
sequence companions. Finally, we detect several faint points
in the Catalina light curve of SDSSJ1018, indicating that it
may well be eclipsing, however there is insuﬃcient data to
conﬁrm this or determine its period.

SDSSJ123931.98+210806.2 : the SDSS spectrum shows a
DA white dwarf, a late-type secondary star and Balmer
lines in emission. Originally classiﬁed as a WDMS binary,
this object was excluded from our sample after we realised
it is the cataclysmic variable IR Com (Manser & G¨ansicke
2014). The SDSS spectrum was taken in a low state.

SDSSJ213408.21+065057.5 : the SDSS spectrum displays
the typical features of a DO degenerate and a early-type
secondary star. Hα is in emission.
