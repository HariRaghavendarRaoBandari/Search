Groups not acting on compact metric

spaces by homeomorphisms

Azer Akhmedov

Abstract: We show that the direct sum of uncountably many non-Abelian
groups does not embed into the group of homeomorphisms of a compact metric
space.

The main result of this note does not seem to exist in the literature.
Among other things, it provides very simple examples of left-orderable
groups of continuum cardinality which do not embed in Homeo+(R) 1

Theorem 1. Let X be a compact metric space, I be an uncountable
set, and Gα be a non-Abelian group, for all α ∈ I. Then the direct
sum ⊕
Gα does not embed into the group of homeomorphisms of X.
α∈I

Proof. We will assume that the direct sum ⊕
α∈I

Gα embeds in Homeo(X).

For all α ∈ I, let fα, gα be some non-commuting elements in Gα. We
will denote the metric on X by d(., .). Notice that the group Homeo(X)
of homeomorphisms of X also becomes a metric space where for φ, ψ ∈
Homeo(X), we deﬁne the metric by D(φ, ψ) = sup
x∈X

d(φ(x), ψ(x)).

By compactness of X, we have a sequence Cn, n ≥ 1 of ﬁnite subsets

of X such that

(i) for all n ≥ 1, Cn is a 1

n -net, i.e. for all x ∈ X, there exists z ∈ Cn

such that d(z, x) < 1
n,

(ii) Cn ⊆ Cn+1, for all n ≥ 1,
(iii) ∪n≥1Cn = X.

Let Cn = {x(n)

1 , . . . , x(n)

pn }, n ≥ 1. For all n ≥ 1 and δ > 0, we will

also write

Fn,δ = {φ ∈ Homeo(X) | diamφ(B 2

n

(x(n)

i

)) < δ, ∀i ∈ {1, . . . , pn}}

1It is well known that a countable group is left-orderable iﬀ it embeds into
Homeo+(R). Thus it becomes an interesting question whether or not there exists a
left-orderable group of continuum cardinality which does not embed in Homeo+(R).
This question has been addressed in a very recent paper [M] where two diﬀerent
examples have been constructed.

Since Homeo(X)\{1} = ∪
i≥1

{φ | D(φ, 1) >

} there exists c > 0

and an uncountable set I1 ⊂ I such that for all α ∈ I1 we have
D([fα, gα], 1) > c.

By compactness, all homeomorphisms of X are uniformly continuous.
Then there exists an uncountable set I2 ⊂ I1 and positive integers n, m
such that max{ 1

Then, since Homeo(X) is separable, there exists an uncountable set
I3 ⊂ I2 and f⋆, g⋆ ∈ Homeo(X) such that for all γ ∈ I3 we have
max{D(fγ, f⋆), D(gγ, g⋆)} < 1

m } < c

Then for all γ, η ∈ I3 and for all x ∈ X we have the inequalities

d(gηfγ(x), gγfγ(x)) <

50n

and d(fγgη(x), fγgγ(x)) <

c

.

On the other hand, for any two distinct η, γ ∈ I3 there exists x0 ∈ X
such that d(fγgγ(x0), gγfγ(x0)) > c.

By triangle inequality, we obtain that d(gηfγ(x0), fγgη(x0)) > c
2.

Thus [gη, fγ] 6= 1. Contradiction. (cid:3)

Remark. To obtain interesting applications of the main theorem,
X can be taken to be an arbitrary compact manifold (with bound-
In the case of a closed interval I ∼= [0, 1], we obtain a non-
ary).
embeddability result into Homeo+(R), i.e. the direct sum of uncount-
ably many isomorphic copies of a non-Abelian group G does not embed
in Homeo+(R). The result of Theorem 1 can be extended to a much
larger class of topological spaces. One can also drop or replace the
non-Abelian condition on the group G in certain special contexts.
