ABSTRACT

We present the peculiar in-plane velocities derived from the LAMOST red clump stars. From
the variations of the in-plane velocity with the Galactocentric radius for the young and old red
clump stars, we are able to identify two types of peculiar velocities: 1) both the two red clump
populations show that the radial velocity is negative within R = 9.0 kpc and becomes positive beyond
(denoted as the long-wave mode); and 2) the young red clump stars show larger mean radial velocity
than the old population by about 3 kms−1 between R = 9 and 12 kpc (denoted as the short-wave
mode). We ﬁnd that the elliptical disk induced by the rotating bar can well explain the long-wave
mode peculiar velocity. The axis ratio of the elliptical disk is around 0.8-0.95 and the disk keeps
circular at R = 9.24 ± 0.2 kpc, which should be the location of the outer Lindblad resonance radius
(OLR). Adopting the circular speed of 238 kms−1, the pattern speed of the bar is then derived as
48 ± 3 kms−1kpc−1 from the location of OLR. On the other hand, the short-wave mode is likely the

perturbation of the spiral arms as density waves.

INTRODUCTION

In recent years, the Galactic disk is found not symmet-
ric in both the star density and kinematics. Widrow et
al. (2012) claimed that the vertical stellar density shows
small-amplitude but signiﬁcant oscillation in both the
north and south of the Galactic mid-plane. Xu et al.
(2015) further found the wave-like ring in the outer disk.
Siebert et al. (2011a) discovered from the RAVE (Siebert
et al. 2011b) survey data that the radial velocity in the
solar neighborhood is not symmetric, the stars show
about 7 kms−1 toward the inner Galaxy. Bond et al.
(2010) also conﬁrmed this from the SDSS survey data.
Carlin et al. (2013), Williams et al. (2013), and Sun et
al. (2015) demonstrated that the asymmetric motion is
not only in radial direction, but also in vertical direction.
And Tian et al.
(2015) found that the asymmetric mo-
tion may be related to the age of the stars. Bovy et al.
(2015) studied the power spectrum of the velocity map
in the X–Y plane for the APOGEE (Alam et al. 2015)
red clump stars and argued that the velocity oscillation
with a broad peak at the wave number of 0.2–0.9 kpc−1
is likely due to the Galactic central bar.

Several theoretical works provided possible explana-
tions about how the asymmetric stellar density and os-
cillated velocity happen. G´omez et al.
(2013) thought
that the asymmetric vertical stellar density and the bulk
motions can be the result of the perturbation of the mi-
nor merger. Siebert et al. (2012), who used a simpliﬁed

model of the perturbation from the spiral density wave
and Faure et al. (2014) ran N-body simulations with spi-
ral arms to explain that the asymmetric motion revealed
by Siebert et al. (2011a) could be the induced by the
spiral structures. Debattista (2014) found from the N-
body simulations that the (strong) spiral structures can
induce vertical oscillation near the disk mid-plane. Re-
cently, Grand et al. (2015) applied the power spectrum
approach to the N-body simulation data and found that
the bar with transient co-rotating spiral structures can
produce similar features found in Bovy et al. (2015).

Theoretically, the peculiar velocities can be either
induced by the perturbation of the non-axisymmetric
structures or can geometrically reﬂect the lopsidedness
of the disk. Many works have discussed about the for-
mer scenario (Siebert et al. 2012; G´omez et al.
2013;
Debattista 2014). Here we highlight more about the lat-
ter.

Lopsidedness, which means the surface brightness of
a galactic disk is not perfectly axisymmetric but varies
with the azimuthal angle in the polar coordinates, is a
common feature in galaxies (Richter & Sancisi 1994; Rix
& Zaritsky 1995; Zaritsky & Rix 1997; Swaters et al.
1999; Conselice et al. 2000; Bournaud et al. 2005, etc.).
Rix & Zaritsky (1995) decomposed the surface brightness
of 18 face-on galaxies to Fourier series in polar coordi-
nates and found many of them show signiﬁcantly large
amplitudes from mode 1 to mode 6. Particularly, the
bar and two-arm spiral structure can naturally form the
mode 2 structure, i.e. the disk looks elliptic rather than
circular. The lopsided and elliptic disk should be in state
status and thus the stars in these non-axisymmetric disks
must have coherent peculiar motion biased from the ax-
isymmetric velocities. Kuijken & Tremaine (1994) and
Rix & Zaritsky (1995) derived the features of both the
geometry and the coherent radial and azimuthal veloc-

2

HJT, CL, et al.

ities for the disk given a non-rotating elliptical gravita-
tional potential. Speciﬁcally, the major axis of the el-
liptical disk is perpendicular to the major axis of the
elliptical gravitational potential. The ellipticity of the
surface brightness within the underlying elliptical poten-
tial smoothly disappear when the radius become large
(see Eq. (11) in Rix & Zaritsky 1995). Meanwhile, the
maximal azimuthal velocity occurs at the points of minor
axis, while the maximum of radial velocity shift to 45◦
from the minor axis. Based on the non-rotating ellipti-
cal gravitational potential, Kuijken & Tremaine (1994)
investigated the ellipticity of the disk of the Milky Way
and found the axis ratio of the iso-potential is about 0.9.
However, these models for the elliptical disk do not
account for the rotation of the non-axisymmetric com-
ponent. For a disk with a rotating bar in the central
region, Binney & Tremaine (2008) derived the radius
of the closed loop orbit as the function of the azimuth
angle (see Eqs (4.148a,b)) and displayed that the ma-
jor axes of the closed loop orbits change their direction
at various radii:
inside the Inner Lindblad Resonance
radius (ILR) the major axis of the closed loop orbits
are aligned with the minor-axis of the bar; between the
ILR and the Corotation Resonance radius (CR) they are
aligned with the major-axis of the bar; between the CR
and the Outer Lindblad Resonance radius (OLR) they
are aligned with the minor-axis again; and beyond the
OLR they are aligned back with the major-axis of the
bar. Therefore, the ellipticity of the disk with a central
rotating bar is much more complicated than the mod-
els introduced in Kuijken & Tremaine (1994) and Rix &
Zaritsky (1995) in the sense that not only the axis ratio
may changes with radius, the phase of the ellipticity also
changes with radius.

In this paper, we use the red clump stars, which are
mostly distributed in the Galactic anti-center region,
from the LAMOST survey (Cui et al. 2012; Zhao et al.
2012) to investigate the peculiar in-plane velocities from
Galactocentric radius of R ∼ 7 to 14 kpc in the Galactic
disk. We identify the peculiar velocity features from both
the ellipticity of the bar and from the local perturbation
of the spiral structures from our sample.

The paper is organized as follows.

In Section 2, we
describe how to select the proper red clump stars from
the LAMOST catalog and separate them into young and
old population. In Sections 3, we discuss the approach
to derive the in-plane velocity based on the velocity de-
projection technique. In Section 4, we demonstrate our
results about two kinds of peculiar in-plane velocities,
the long-wave and short-wave oscillations. In Section 5,
we discuss the possible mechanisms which induce these
peculiar velocities. Finally, we draw brief conclusions in
Section 6.

2. DATA

Large Aperture Multi-Object ﬁber Spectroscopic Tele-
scope (LAMOST; also called Guo Shoujing telescope), is
a quasi-meridian reﬂecting Schmidt telescope with the ef-
fective aperture of about 4 meter. In its 5◦ ﬁeld of view,
4000 ﬁbers are installed, which is capable of obtaining
the same number of low resolution spectra (R∼ 1800)
covering from 380 to 900 nm simultaneously (Cui et al.
2012; Zhao et al. 2012). The on-going LAMOST spec-
troscopic survey is focusing on both the stars and some

bright extragalactic objects.
In its 5-year survey plan,
it will obtain a few millions of stellar spectra in about
20,000 square degrees in the northern hemisphere (Deng
et al. 2012).

As December 2015, LAMOST has delivered its second
data release (DR2), containing about 4 million stellar
spectra. Among them, the LAMOST pipeline has pro-
vided stellar astrophysical parameters (eﬀective temper-
ature, surface gravity, and metallicity) as well as line-of-
sight velocities for about 2.2 millions FGK type stars (Wu
et al. 2014). Most of the spectra have well measured line
indices (Liu et al. 2015a). Based on the line indices and
applying the classiﬁcation approach developed by Liu et
al. (2014b), about half million K giant stars are iden-
tiﬁed from LAMOST DR2. Liu et al. (2015b) has im-
proved the surface gravity (logg) estimation with uncer-
tainty of ∼ 0.1 dex for the metal-rich giant stars. Wan et
al. (2015) subsequently identiﬁed about 120 thousands
of red clump (RC) star candidates from LAMOST DR2
catalog based on the empirical distribution model in the
Teﬀ –logg–[Fe/H] space. Not only the primary RC stars,
which are usually considered as standard candles, but
also the secondary RC stars, which are more massive and
young helium core burning stars, are identiﬁed in Wan
et al. (2015). The distances of both types of RC stars
are estimated by them from the isochrone ﬁtting with
accuracy of ∼ 10%.

2.1. Remove the RGB contaminations

The technique used in Wan et al. (2015) is based on
statistics, i.e., for each star, the method can give the
probability to be a RC star. A small fraction of red giant
branch (RGB) stars are then mixed in the RC candidate
catalog. In order to remove these contaminations, we ap-
ply another technique mentioned in the Appendix of Liu
et al. (2014b) to distinguish the RGB stars from the RC
candidates. We map the RC candidates to the [Fe/H] vs.
Mgb plane, where Mgb is the Lick index for the spectral
line of Mg I located around 5184 ˚A based on Worthey et
al. (1994), in Figure 1. It is obviously seen that the den-
sity map of the RC candidates in Figure 1 shows clear
bimodality with a elongated valley from [Fe/H]=-0.6 dex
and Mgb∼ 2 ˚A to [Fe/H]∼ −0.1 dex and Mgb∼ 2.5 ˚A.
Because the RC stars are always warmer than the RGB
stars given the same metallicity and surface gravity, they
should have relatively smaller values of Mgb than the
RGB stars with same [Fe/H] and logg. On the other
hand, logg of the RC stars should be smaller than that
of the RGB stars with same metallicity and eﬀective tem-
perature. The smaller logg also leads to smaller value of
Mgb. Combining the two trends together, given a metal-
licity, the RC stars always locate at the side with smaller
Mgb than the RGB stars.

Therefore, the clump with smaller Mgb should be con-
tributed by the RC stars, while the another clump with
larger Mgb should be contributed by the RGB stars. For
the stars with [Fe/H]> −0.1, the gap between the RC
and the RGB stars is not quite clear. We then over-
lap the common stars between the LAMOST DR2 and
Stello et al. (2013), who classiﬁed the RGB, primary
and secondary RC stars from the seismic features in the
ﬁgure. The RC stars (blue hollow circles for the pri-
mary RC stars and the blue ﬁlled triangles for the sec-

The peculiar velocities in the Galactic outer disk

ondary RC stars) and the RGB stars (represented with
the black hollow rectangles) from Stello et al. (2013)
are well separated in the [Fe/H]–Mgb plane. Then, we
are able to extend the separation between RGB and RC
stars from metallicity lower than −0.1 dex to super-solar
metallicity using the empirical separation line from (Mgb,
[Fe/H])=(2.1, -0.5), (2.5, -0.3), and (3.3, 0.0) to (5.0 ˚A,
0.38 dex) (the thick black line).

Testing the performance of the empirical separation,
we ﬁnd 97% seismic-identiﬁed RC stars are also identi-
ﬁed as the RC stars from the separation line and 94%
seismic-identiﬁed RGB stars are also identiﬁed as RGB
stars. If the RC candidate catalog from Wan et al. (2015)
suﬀers 30% RGB contaminations, the empirical separa-
tion shown in Figure 1 can reduce the contamination by
only about 2%, according to the data from Stello et al.
(2013).

2.2. The young and old RC populations

The primary RC stars are those in the helium core
burning stage which had the degenerate helium core in
late RGB stage and have been triggered the helium ﬂash.
On the contrary, the second RC stars have initial stellar
mass larger than the critical mass of helium ﬂash (around
2M(cid:12)) and thus ignite the helium core before the core be-
come electronic degenerate. Because the diﬀerent evolu-
tionary tracks, the positions for the two types of stars in
the Hertzprung–Russell diagram (or equivalently in the
Teﬀ –logg diagram) are slightly diﬀerent. Moreover, be-
cause the initial stellar mass for the secondary RC stars
are larger, they are in general younger than the primary
RC stars, which is helpful to trace the evolution of the
Galactic disk. However, in practice, it is very diﬃcult
to separate the two kinds of stars directly from the Teﬀ –
logg diagram. Although they can be separated from the
their distinct asteroseismic features (Bedding et al. 2011;
Stello et al. 2013), only very few stars have accurate seis-
mic measurements. Therefore, we turn to separate the
young and old populations of RC stars with the help of
the isochrones. We use the PARSEC isochrones (Bressan
et al. 2012) for the age separation. The triangles shown
in the panels of Figure 2 are the theoretical positions
of the helium core burning stars in Teﬀ –logg plane with
diﬀerent metallicities (from the left to the right panels
are [Fe/H]=(-0.6, -0.3), (-0.3,0.0), and (0.0, 0.4), respec-
tively) . From the isochrones in each [Fe/H] bin, we select
a straight line best ﬁtting the data points at 2 Gyr as the
separation line. The RC stars younger than 2 Gyr are
mostly located below the lines. Although the very young
and massive Helium core burning stars (> 10 M(cid:12)) can
go above the lines, they should be very rare and may not
aﬀect our later analysis. Therefore we ignore these stars
and deﬁne all RC stars located below the 2 Gyr line are
the young population and the RC stars located above the
2 Gyr lines are old.

In order to assess whether the isochrone-based age sep-
aration is feasible, we cross-match the LAMOST RC cat-
alog with the APOGEE data with age estimates from the
[C/N] by Martig et al. (2016). We ﬁnd about 2100 com-
mon RC stars after cross-matching. Figure 3 shows the
distributions of the age derived by Martig et al. (2016)
for the young (blue line) and old (red line) RC stars iden-
tiﬁed from Figure 2. We ﬁnd that the young RC stars are

indeed dominated by young stars, although there is also
many samples located beyond 2 Gyr. And most of the
old RC stars are located in the right side of the 2 Gyr
line (the vertical black dotted-dash line) in the ﬁgure.
The mean values (standard deviations) of the age are 2.7
(1.6) and 4.6 (2.1) Gyr for the isochrone-identiﬁed young
and old RC stars, respectively. Note that the age de-
rived from Martig et al. (2016) may not be consistent
with the PARSEC isochrones, it could have systematical
diﬀerence in age, which can explain why the young RC
stars have larger age in Martig et al. (2016) than what
the isochrones expect. However, in this work, we do not
need accurate age separation but only mark the young
and old populations and focus on the comparison of the
stellar kinematics. For this purpose, the isochrone-based
young/old population separation is suﬃciently helpful.

2.3. The ﬁnal sample

We further select the RC stars close to the Galactic
mid-plane with the criterion of |z| < 1000 pc, where z is
the vertical height above or beneath the mid-plane for
a RC star. And to ensure that the stellar parameters
applied in the above data selection is reliable, we only
select the stars with signal-to-noise ratio larger than 10.
Finally, we obtain 42,713 old and 19,963 young RC stars.
Figure 4 displays the spatial distribution of the old (in
left panels) and young (in the right panels) RC stars in
the three dimensional Galactocentric cylindrical coordi-
nates. The top row is for the R–φ plane and the bottom
row is for the R–z plane. The smoothed color contours
represent for the number density of the stars.

3. THE METHOD

Ideally, to obtain the in-plane velocity of the Galac-
tic disk, we need to know the tangential velocity as well
as the line-of-sight velocity for the tracers. However, as
shown in Figure 4, lots of the samples are too far to have
reliable proper motion measures. Therefore, we cannot
directly obtain the tangential velocities. However, if we
assume that the mean velocity components, namely (cid:104)vR(cid:105),
(cid:104)vφ(cid:105), and (cid:104)vz(cid:105), are same at given Galactocentric radius
R for the dataset, we can derive them from the velocity
de-projection technique (Liu et al. 2014a; Tian et al.
2015). This assumption is held if the disk is axisymmet-
ric. When the disk is non-axisymmetric, if (cid:104)vR(cid:105), (cid:104)vφ(cid:105),
and (cid:104)vz(cid:105) do not substantially change within the relative
smaller range of the azimuth angle that the data sam-
ples expand, the invariance of the three mean velocity
components is still approximately held. For our sample,
the range of the azimuth angle is only about 20◦ and
based on Kuijken & Tremaine (1994) our Galaxy is not
dramatically elliptical, then we can determine the three
mean velocity components for each R bin using the de-
projection approach.

3.1. The velocity de-projection approach

Although McMillan & Binney (2009) found that the
de-projection can induce systematic bias in velocity el-
lipsoid, especially the cross-terms, Tian et al.
(2015)
have proved that the de-projection approach can well re-
produce the ﬁrst-order momenta, i.e. the mean velocity
components, without taking into account the bias of the
spatial sampling.

HJT, CL, et al.

Given a star, the line-of-sight velocity can be obtained

from

vlos = −(cid:104)vR(cid:105) cos(l + φ) cos b +(cid:104)vφ(cid:105)(z) sin(l + φ) cos b

+(cid:104)vz(cid:105) sin b − v(cid:12),los,

(1)

where l, b, and φ are the Galactic longitude, latitude and
the azimuth angle with respect to the Galactic center,
respectively. Noted that (cid:104)vφ(cid:105) is a declining function of
|z|. Bond et al. (2010) suggested the empirical relation
between (cid:104)vφ(cid:105) and |z| as

(cid:104)vφ(cid:105)(z) = (cid:104)vφ(cid:105)(z = 0) − 19.2|z|1.25.

(2)

It is derived from the SDSS proper motion data beyond
z = 1 kpc. However, our data is within z = 1 kpc. There-
fore, we have to extrapolate the relation to our data. It is
also worthy to note that Smith et al. (2012) also provided
a few data points of (cid:104)vφ(cid:105) between |z| = 500 and 1000 pc.
We tested to use both relations in equation 1 to derive
the 3D averaged velocity components. The diﬀerence
between the two relations are very small. Therefore, we
decided to adopt the relation from Bond et al.
(2010)
in this work.

The solar motion about the Galactic center projected

to the line of sight can be written as
v(cid:12),los = U(cid:12) cos l cos b + (v0 + V(cid:12)) sin l cos b + W(cid:12) sin b,
(3)
where U(cid:12), V(cid:12), and W(cid:12) are the three components of the
solar motion w.r.t the local standard of rest (LSR) and
v0 is the circular speed of the LSR. We adopt the so-
(2015) as (U(cid:12), V(cid:12), W(cid:12)) =
lar motion from Tian et al.
(9.58, 10.52, 7.01) kms−1, the distance of the Sun to the
Galactic center is R0 = 8 kpc, and the circular speed of
LSR is v0 = 238 kms−1 (Sch¨onrich 2012).

3.2. Method validation with the mock RC data

Before we apply the velocity de-projection method to
the observed data, we run a Monte Carlo simulation to
test its validation. We borrow the 3D spatial positions
from the observed RC samples and re-assign 3D mock ve-
locities for each star such that we prepare a mock dataset
with exactly the same spatial sampling and known ve-
locity. We then use the velocity de-projection approach
to derive the mean velocity components at various radii
from the mock data and compare them with the input
values to test the validation of the method and to derive
the uncertainties of the derived mean velocity compo-
nents owe to the biased spatial sampling of the survey.

For each mock star, we draw an arbitrary veloc-
ity vector from a 3D Gaussian distribution with the
peak value of (vR, vφ, vz)=(0,200,0) kms−1and sigmas
of (σR, σφ, σz)=(35,25,20) kms−1. Then, for each R bin
we run a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simula-
tion to derive the most likely (cid:104)vR(cid:105), (cid:104)vφ(cid:105), and (cid:104)vz(cid:105) and
their uncertainties. We use the emcee code to run the
MCMC (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013). We repeatedly
produce 50 sets of the mock dataset with diﬀerent ran-
dom velocities drawn from the same Gaussian distribu-
tion and the ﬁnal mean velocities as functions of R for
the young and old RC populations are shown in Fig-
ure 5. The top panel shows the mean radial velocity as
a function of R for the young (blue asterisks) and old
(red circles) mock RC stars. The de-projection-derived

(cid:104)vR(cid:105) for both populations well reproduce the true value
of (cid:104)vR(cid:105), which is zero. The error bars at various R bins
are the standard deviations of (cid:104)vR(cid:105) for the 50 simula-
tions. The ﬁrst point at R = 7.5 kpc and the points
beyond 12 kpc show larger errors, which is likely because
the fewer samples falling in these bins.

The bottom panel shows the similar test result for the
azimuthal velocity. Again, the de-projection-derived (cid:104)vφ(cid:105)
well follow the true value of 200 kms. Compared with
(cid:104)vR(cid:105), the error bars of (cid:104)vφ(cid:105) for the bins beyond 12 kpc are
signiﬁcantly larger for two reasons: the fewer samples in
these bins and the observed RC stars expand in a much
smaller range in azimuth angle.
Indeed, the range of
azimuth angle for the RC stars located within R = 12 kpc
is about 20-30◦ (see Figure 4), while for the stars beyond
12 kpc the range reduces to less than 10◦. The smaller
range of φ is responsible for the larger uncertainties of
(cid:104)vφ(cid:105) in these radii.
Nevertheless, this test demonstrates that the veloc-
ity de-projection approach is feasible to derive (cid:104)vR(cid:105) and
(cid:104)vφ(cid:105) with moderate uncertainties due to the sampling of
the survey.
It is worthy to note that the velocity de-
projection also works out the mean vertical velocity with
larger uncertainty. More investigations on the vertical
velocity will be in Liu et al. in preparation.

4. RESULTS

4.1. The radial variation of the in-plane velocities
Both the young and old RC stars are not evenly dis-
tributed in R, as shown in Figure 4, therefore, we need to
carefully choose the binning strategy along R. In prin-
ciple, we want the number of stars in each R bin to be
large enough for better statistics. On the other hand, we
want that the resulting velocities between the neighbor-
ing bins can be comparable. Therefore, we separate the
R bins with equal number of 1500 for the young and old
RC stars respectively. At the smallest and largest ends
of R, namely when R < 8 kpc and when R > 12 kpc,
the number of stars become much fewer, keeping 1500
stars within a bin will signiﬁcantly enlarge the bin size.
Therefore, we reduce the number of stars in a bin at the
two ends of R to a much smaller number from 250 to 700.
The choice of these numbers of stars at the two ends are
empirical based on many tests so that the statistics and
the resolution in R in this two regimes can be relatively
balance.

Tian et al.

(2015) have claimed that the LAM-
OST line-of-sight velocity is systematically smaller than
the APOGEE measure by 5.7 kms−1 for unclear reason.
Thus, we add 5.7 kms−1 to the line-of-sight velocity for
all the RC stars before deriving the mean in-plane veloc-
ity components.

We then apply the velocity de-projection technique to
the observed dataset and obtain the mean velocity com-
ponents at each R bin, as shown in the left panels of
Figure 6.
In this work, we focus only on the in-plane
velocities, i.e. (cid:104)vR(cid:105) and (cid:104)vφ(cid:105). The vertical velocity is be-
yond the scope of this paper and will be further discussed
in the next paper (Liu et al. in preparation).

4.1.1. Radial variation of (cid:104)vR(cid:105)

tion of (cid:104)vR(cid:105) for both the young (blue lines) and the old

(red lines) RC stars. The error bars are composed of
two parts: the uncertainty of the derived (cid:104)vR(cid:105) from the
MCMC procedure and the uncertainties of the sampling
in the R bin obtained from the Monte Carlo simulation
mentioned in section 3.2. The detail values showing in
the ﬁgure can be found in Table 1 for the young and
Table 2 for the old RC stars.

The most prominent feature displayed in the panel is
that (cid:104)vR(cid:105) for the both populations are mostly negative
at R (cid:46) 9.0 kpc (except only one point at R = 7.09 kpc,
which is probably a real feature but for some unclear
reasons, or just due to the special selection eﬀect at this
radius), while both the radial proﬁles of (cid:104)vR(cid:105) become pos-
itive beyond R ∼ 9.0 kpc. For the bins with R (cid:46) 9.0 kpc,
the mean radial velocity can be as large as ∼ −33 kms−1
at R ∼ 7.6 kpc. For the bins with R (cid:38) 9.0 kpc, most of
the mean radial velocities are between 4 and 8 kms−1. It
is obvious that the young and the old RC stars have dif-
ferent radial (cid:104)vR(cid:105) proﬁle, especially at 9 < R < 12 kpc.
Although the two populations show diﬀerent (cid:104)vR(cid:105) at dif-
ferent R bins, the cross-zero points of the radial proﬁles
of (cid:104)vR(cid:105) are consistent with each other.
Compare this result with Bovy et al. (2015), who
mapped the line-of-sight velocity into X-Y plane (see
their Fig.2), the pattern of the radial variation is quite
consistent with this work.
If we only focus in about
1 kpc around the Sun, the variation of the radial velocity
with R is also in agreement with Siebert et al. (2011a).
At the location of the Sun, their vR reads about −7 ∼
−24 kms−1, while we derive about −5 ∼ −33 kms−1. We
then look at the variation of (cid:104)vR(cid:105) with Carlin et al. (2013)
and ﬁnd that within R ∼ 9 kpc, the radial velocities is
about −10 kms−1 and at R > 9 kpc, the radial velocity
increases to about −5 kms−1. The trend of vR with R in
of the velocity shift by about −10 kms−1 contrast to our

their result seems similar to this work, while the values

RC stars. Notice that Carlin et al. (2013) measured the
radial velocity from the combination of the line-of-sight
velocities and the proper motions, complicated system-
atics may be responsible for the diﬀerence. For instance,
Carlin et al. (2013) did not correct the LAMOST DR1 de-
rived line-of-sight velocities by adding 5.7 kms−1, which
is found by comparing with the APOGEE data (Tian
et al. 2015); the diﬀerent distance estimations may in-
duce systematics; and the proper motion may also lead
to some bias in velocity.

The diﬀerential radial velocity, ∆(cid:104)vR(cid:105), between the
young and the old populations are displayed in the top-
right panel of Figure 6 and the detailed values are listed
at the last few columns in Table 1. The plot shows that
the mean radial velocities for the young RC stars are
larger than those for the old RC stars by about 3 kms−1
between R = 9 and 12 kpc. This diﬀerence is at least 2-σ
signiﬁcance for each bin. However, combined with the
all the bins within the range of R, the diﬀerence turns to
be very signiﬁcant, implying that the diﬀerence should
be a real feature.
It is worthy to note that the range
of R happened to be located between the Perseus and
the Outer arm. The radial positions of the spiral arms,
i.e. the local arm, the Perseus arm, and the Outer arm,
from the trigonometric parallaxes of the masers (Reid et
al. 2014) are superposed in the ﬁgure with cyan vertical
lines.

Another large diﬀerence between the two populations
of RC stars occurs at R ∼ 8 kpc, at which (cid:104)vR(cid:105) for the
young RC stars is signiﬁcantly smaller than that of the
old stars and hence produces a huge dip.

4.1.2. Radial variation of (cid:104)vφ(cid:105)

The bottom-left panel of Figure 6 displays the radial
proﬁles of (cid:104)vφ(cid:105) for the young (blue line) and old (red line)
RC stars. The dashed horizontal line indicates the ve-
locity of 238 kms−1, which is the adopted circular speed
in the solar neighborhood, as a reference.

The radial proﬁle of (cid:104)vφ(cid:105) shows two patterns. In the
regime of R < 11 kpc, the mean azimuthal velocities for
both the young and old populations mildly decrease by
10-20 kms−1 from R ∼ 7.0 kpc to 10.5 kpc. Moreover,
(cid:104)vφ(cid:105) for the young population is larger than those for
the old population by ∼ 10 kms−1 in this regime. This is
natural since the young RC stars should be kinematically
colder and hence rotates faster than the old population.
However, beyond R = 10.5 kpc, the mean azimuthal ve-
locities for the old RC stars increase to around 260 kms−1
at R > 13 kpc, while the young population abruptly in-
creases to 245 kms−1 at R = 12 kpc, and then drop back
to 220 kms−1 when R > 13 kpc. The abrupt change of
(cid:104)vφ(cid:105) for the young population is within 1σ uncertainty,
thus must be due to the fewer observed sample in such
large distance. The pattern of the radial proﬁle of (cid:104)vφ(cid:105)
for the old population is consistent with the the result
from Liu et al. (2014a), who used mostly the old popula-
tion of the RC stars to reconstruct the in-plane kinemat-
ics of the Galactic outer disk. The reason of the sudden
raise of (cid:104)vφ(cid:105) for old population is not quite clear.
The bottom-right panel of Figure 6 shows the ra-
dial proﬁle of the diﬀerential mean azimuthal velocities,
∆(cid:104)vφ(cid:105), subtracting (cid:104)vφ(cid:105) for the old stars from that of the
young stars. ∆(cid:104)vφ(cid:105) is essentially ﬂat at about 10 kms−1,
reﬂecting the diﬀerence in rotation between the two age
populations.

5. DISCUSSIONS

The radial variation of (cid:104)vR(cid:105) discussed in section 4.1.1
looks much clearer than that of (cid:104)vφ(cid:105) shown in sec-
tion 4.1.2, because the uncertainty in the derivation of
(cid:104)vR(cid:105) is much smaller for our dataset. From (cid:104)vR(cid:105) proﬁles,
we identify two types of peculiar velocity. First, both
the young and old populations have negative (cid:104)vR(cid:105) with
R (cid:46) 9.0 kpc and turn to be positive beyond the value. If
we consider this type of variation of the radial velocity
as a radial wave, the wave length must be larger than
6 kpc by a factor of a few, since there is only one cross-
zero point between R = 8 and 14 kpc.
In this sense,
we denote such a peculiar velocity as a long-wave mode.
Second, the diﬀerential radial velocity shows a bump be-
tween R = 9 and 12 kpc, which is much shorter than the
long-wave mode. We then denote the wave shown in the
diﬀerence of (cid:104)vR(cid:105) between the young and old populations
as a short-wave mode. In the next two sub-sections we
discuss the possible mechanisms for the two types of the
peculiar velocities.

5.1. The long-wave mode

From previous works, it is noted that the velocity wave
perturbed by the spiral structures are always spatially

6

HJT, CL, et al.

correlated with the spiral arms (see Siebert et al. 2012;
Faure et al. 2014; Grand et al. 2015). The long-wave
mode structure in radial velocity, however, does not show
correlation with any spiral arm in the outer disk. More-
over, it seems that the perturbation from the merging
dwarf galaxies, e.g.
the Sgr dwarf, will raise vertical
wave but may not intensively aﬀect the in-plane veloc-
ity (G´omez et al. 2013). Therefore, the long-wave mode
may neither be induced by the spiral arms nor by the
merging dwarf galaxies.

Alternatively, if the disk is elliptical due to the bar, the
orbital ellipticity can naturally produce non-zero mean
radial velocities. It is apparently that the elliptical grav-
itational potential introduced by Kuijken & Tremaine
(1994) and Rix & Zaritsky (1995) do not match the radial
variation of (cid:104)vR(cid:105). Then the rotating bar, which makes
the elliptical gravitational potential rotate, is taken into
account.

Notice that the direction of the major axis of the el-
liptical closed loop orbits in a rotating elliptical gravita-
tional potential changes a few times at various radii (see
section 1) To better demonstrate this we show a cartoon
in Figure 7. The elliptical closed loop orbits (shown as
the blue line) located between the CR and OLR should
be perpendicular to the major axis of the bar. In this
case, the radial component of the velocity (indicated with
blue arrow) for the closed loop orbit at the Galactic anti-
center region should be negative according to the relative
spatial position between the bar and the Sun. On the
other hand, the orbits located beyond the OLR (red cir-
cle) are aligned with the major axis of the bar and thus
show positive radial velocity (indicated with the red ar-
row) in the Galactic anti-center direction. Right at the
OLR, the two directions of the elliptical closed orbits
mixed with each other and together show zero mean ra-
dial velocity. Therefore, it is expected that the closed
loop orbit should be elliptical at both sides of the OLR,
but keep circular right at the OLR. Meanwhile, looking
the stars along the Galactic anti-center direction from
the Sun, the radial velocity is expected to be negative at
smaller R, and be zero at this point corresponds to the
OLR, and then becomes positive at larger R.

For the real stars, they are rarely moving exactly on
the closed stellar orbits, but on the non-closed objects
with radial excursions. The excursions in radial direc-
tion may lead to dispersions and may produce an en-
velope surrounding the closed loop orbit. However, the
mean velocities should well follow that on the closed loop
orbits.

This schematic scenario with a rotating bar in the cen-
tral region can well explain the observed radial variation
of the mean radial velocities shown in Figure 6.

We then estimate the variation of the ellipticity due
to the rotating bar with the simple projection of the in-
plane velocity components for the stars with elliptical
closed loop orbits, which should exist in the underlying
gravitational potential with a rotating bar:

(cid:104)vR(cid:105) = vφ,0(cid:104)sin 2(φ − φ0)(cid:105)
(cid:104)vφ(cid:105) = vφ,0(1 − (cid:104)cos 2(φ − φ0)(cid:105)),

(4)

where vφ,0 is the azimuthal velocity when the closed loop
orbit is circular.  refers to the ﬂattening of the elliptical
closed loop orbit. And φ0 is the angle between the major

axis of the bar and the line connecting the Galactic center
and the Sun. The axis ratio of the orbit can be written
as

q = 1 − .

(5)

The axis ratio q and vφ,0 can be derived from the ob-
served (cid:104)vR(cid:105) and (cid:104)vφ(cid:105) when φ0 is known. We give three
measurments for φ0 = 20◦, 30◦, and 40◦, respectively.
The results corresponding to various φ0 are quite sim-
ilar and are listed in Tables 1 and 2. Figure 8 shows
the derived q and vφ,0 at various R bins for both the
young (blue lines) and old (red lines) RC stars only at
φ0 = 20◦. Focusing only on the old population since it is
less aﬀected by other types of perturbation, the axis ratio
of the closed loop orbits shown in the top panel is about
0.8 with R < 8 kpc and then increases to almost 1.0,
i.e. the closed loop orbits are circular, at the cross-zero
point (R = 9.24 ± 0.2 kpc), and then beyond 9.24 kpc,
the axis ratio drops again to around 0.95. The diﬀerence
between the old and young populations should be related
to the short-wave mode, which will be discussed in the
next sub-section. The radial variation of the axisymmet-
ric azimuthal velocity vφ,0 is shown in the bottom panel.
Both the young and old populations show quite ﬂat vφ,0
with R < 10.5 kpc. Beyond this radius, due to the un-
clear abrupt changes, the derived vφ,0 shifts far from the
reference 238 kms−1.

The derived q of the old population is evident that
the closed loop orbits are elliptical before and after R =
9.24 ± 0.2 kpc, but are circular at this radius.
For the rotating bar, the CR should be in the inner disk
of R ∼ 4 − 6 kpc depending on the pattern speed of the
bar (Gerhard 2011). Then the OLR should be beyond
R0 if the circular speed is around 238 kms−1. Therefore,
the point R = 9.24 ± 0.2 kpc with q ∼ 1.0 and (cid:104)vR(cid:105)= 0
should be exactly at the OLR. Consequently, the circular
frequency, Ω, at this point should satisfy the following
equation:

m(Ω − Ωb) = κ,

(6)

where m = 2 in our case, κ is the radial frequency of the
stellar orbit at OLR, and Ωb is the pattern speed of the
bar (cf. Eq. 3.150 in Binney & Tremaine 2008). With
the assumption that the epicyclic approximation is valid
for the stellar orbits, κ can be given as

κ2 = (R

dΩ2
dR

+ 4Ω2).

(7)

According to Binney & Tremaine (2008),
it can be
derived that κ = √3Ω given the ﬂat circular speed
nearby the OLR. With known local circular speed
(238 kms−1), the pattern speeds of the bar is estimated
as 48±3 kms−1kpc−1, within the range of the previous

estimates (Gerhard 2011; Long et al. 2013; Wang et al.
2013).

The long-wave mode is one of the most prominent fea-
tures compared with the short-wave mode discussed in
next section. And it may reﬂect the ellipticity of the disk
induced by the rotating bar according to our above dis-
cussions. This can well explain that when Grand et al.
(2015) compared the power spectra from diﬀerent sim-
ulations with that from the APOGEE RC data derived
by Bovy et al. (2015), they found that the simulations

The peculiar velocities in the Galactic outer disk

7

with a bar show very similar power spectra to the ob-
served one.

It is noted that the Eq. (3.150) in Binney & Tremaine
(2008) is based on the epicyclic approximation and hence
requires that the velocity dispersion must be suﬃciently
small. Indeed, the bottom-left panel of Figure 6 shows
that the azimuthal velocities for both RC populations
are quite close to the circular speed with lags of 10-
20 kms−1, implying that both the populations are kine-
matically cold and the epicyclic approximation should be
held. Therefore, we would expect that the ellipticity of
the two RC populations should be same.

5.2. The short-wave mode

Another interesting feature shown in Figure 6 is that
the mean radial velocities between the young and the
old RC stars are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent between 9 and
12 kpc. Because the Perseus arm is located at about
10 kpc and the Outer arm is located at about 13 kpc in
the Galactic anti-center region (Reid et al. 2014), the
diﬀerential radial velocity may be associated with the
two spiral arms.

In order to investigate whether the diﬀerential velocity
is associated with the spiral structures, we adopt the an-
alytical analysis discussed by Siebert et al. (2012), which
is based on the perturbation theory of the density wave.
The potential from the spiral structures can be given in
the following form:

Φspiral = A(R) exp[i(ωt − mφ + Θ(R))],

(8)
where A(R) is the amplitude of the perturbation, m is
the number of arms, ω is the angular speed, which is as-
sociated with the angular frequency via Ωs = ω/m, φ is
the azimuth angle, and Θ(R) is a monotonic function to
describe the shape of the spiral. The spiral structures

can induce the perturbed radial velocity ((cid:104)(cid:101)VR(cid:105)) and az-
imuthal velocity ((cid:104)(cid:101)Vφ(cid:105)) as

with k(R) < 0 for trailing waves and k(R) > 0 for leading

We generate the (cid:104)(cid:101)VR(cid:105) and (cid:104)(cid:101)Vφ(cid:105) for a toy model of the

Galactic potential including an exponential disk and 2
spiral arms based on Eq. (8) for comparison with the
observed short-wave mode. The adopted parameters of
the model of potential are listed in Table 3. The top
panel of Figure 9 shows the radial variations of the model

(cid:104)(cid:101)VR(cid:105) (black lines) and (cid:104)(cid:101)Vφ(cid:105) (red lines) in the Galactic

anti-center direction. The solid lines represent for the
radial variations mimic to the young population with
F (1) = F (2) = 0.8, while the dashed lines stand for
the radial variations mimic to the old population with
F (1) = F (2) = 0.5. The dot-dashed blue lines refer to
the two spiral arms in the toy model.
It shows that
the phases of the radial and azimuthal velocity, relative
to the location of the spiral arms, are quite diﬀerent.
For the radial velocity, the peak of the wave occurs in
between the two arms and the valleys of the wave well
overlap the location of the spiral arms, while for the az-
imuthal velocity, the peak of the wave is not consistent
with the radial velocity, but right behind of the spiral
arm. And as expected, the young population has larger
amplitude than the older population in both velocities.
The bottom panel of Figure 9 shows the diﬀerential
velocities between the young and the old populations.
Compared this with the diﬀerential velocities in the right
panels of Figure 6, we ﬁnd that, qualitatively, they show
quite similar pattern in the diﬀerential radial velocity to
the observed RC stars. Therefore, it is very likely that
the signiﬁcant diﬀerential radial velocity for the young
and old RC stars reﬂect the diﬀerent extents of response
of the perturbation of the two outskirt spiral arms. How-
ever, for the observed diﬀerential azimuthal velocity, it is
not agree with the toy model. This is probably because
that, in the realistic situation, the perturbation in the
velocities are much more complicated and the measured
velocities may be the combination of all perturbations.

6. CONCLUSIONS

The perturbations due to the bar, the spiral arms, the
merging dwarf galaxies etc. may only give very small
amount of oﬀset in the stellar kinematics. The disk
stars are likely aﬀected simultaneously by a few diﬀerent
kinds of perturbations. Hence, the resulting variations
of the mean velocity may be the combination of diﬀerent
modes. In this work, we identify at least two types of
the perturbation in the LAMOST RC stars. The long-
wave mode seems associated with the rotating bar, which
reshapes the disk to be elliptical. In the underlying ro-
tating elliptical gravitational potential, the closed loop
orbits corresponding to the minimum total energy is no
longer circular as in an axisymmetric potential, but be-
come elliptical. Moreover, the major-axis of the ellipti-
cal orbits varies with radii due to the torque induced by
the rotating non-axisymmetric potential. This leads to
a various radial velocity along the Galactic anti-center

direction depending on the relevant angular position be-
tween the Sun the the bar. The radial velocity is neg-
ative within the OLR and become positive beyond the
OLR. At the OLR, the radial velocity is exactly zero.
The observed radial proﬁle of (cid:104)vR(cid:105) perfectly shows such
a trend. The derived axis ratio of the elliptical orbits is
about 0.8 within OLR and 0.95 beyond for the case of
20◦. Moreover, the (cid:104)vR(cid:105)= 0 point, which should be at
48± 3 kms−1kpc−1 with the circular speed of 238 kms−1.

the OLR, implies that the pattern speed of the bar is

The diﬀerential radial velocity between the young and
old RC stars may reveal the perturbation from the spiral
arms. The amplitude of the perturbation induced by the
spiral structures depends on how cold the kinematics of
the stars is, i.e. the stars with smaller velocity disper-
sion are easier to be perturbed by the spiral arms, while
the torque from the rotating bar aﬀects all ages of the
stars with large angular momenta. Therefore, ∆(cid:104)vR(cid:105) be-
tween the young and old populations can ﬁlter the eﬀect
from the bar and emphasize the inﬂuence from the spiral
arms. Based on the simpliﬁed toy model of the pertur-
bation from density wave spiral structures, we ﬁnd the

diﬀerential radial velocity is very likely associated with
the spiral arms, although the diﬀerential azimuthal ve-
locity does not completely coincide with the perturbation
model.

Fig. 1.— The distribution of the RC candidate stars from Wan et al. (2015) in the [Fe/H]-Mgb plane. The contours show the number
density of the LAMOST RC candidates. The black rectangles, blue circles, and blue ﬁlled triangles are the red giant branch stars, the
primary red clump stars, and the secondary red clump stars identiﬁed by Stello et al. (2013), respectively.

Fig. 2.— The separation of the young and old RC stars in three [Fe/H] bins, -0.6<[Fe/H]<-0.3 (left panel), -0.3<[Fe/H]<0 (middle panel),
and 0<[Fe/H]<0.4 (right panel). The black triangles are the isochrones for the helium core burning stars from Bressan et al. (2012). From
the left to the right in the left panel, the isochrones are at [Fe/H]=-0.6, -0.5, and -0.4. For each isochrone, the triangles present for 0.2, 0.5,
1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 5.0 Gyr from left to top-right. In the middle panel, the isochrone tracks are at [Fe/H]=-0.3, -0.2, and -0.1 from left to
right, respectively. In the right panels, the isochrones are at [Fe/H]=0.1 and 0.3 from left to right, respectively. The straight lines are the
best ﬁt separation lines at 2 Gyr in diﬀerent ranges of [Fe/H]. Below the lines are the isochrone-based young population with age< 2 Gyr
and above are the old population with age> 2 Gyr.

Fig. 6.— The top-left panel displays the variation of (cid:104)vR(cid:105) for the young (blue) and old (red) RC stars. The green dashed values indicate
the zero line. The bottom-left shows the variation of (cid:104)vφ(cid:105) for the both populations. The green dashed line indicates the 238 kms−1 as
a reference. The top-right panel shows the diﬀerential radial velocity (Young - Old) along R. And the bottom-right panel shows the
diﬀerential azimuthal velocities as a function of R. The cyan vertical solid and dash lines in all panels mark the range of the location of
spiral arms (Reid et al. 2014). The corresponding values in all four panels are speciﬁed in Table 1 and 2.

Fig. 7.— This cartoon demonstrates the elliptical closed loop orbit inside (blue curve) and outside (red curve) the OLR. The red and
blue straight lines represent for the major axes of the two orbits, respectively. The arrows indicate the velocity vectors at the Galactic
anti-center direction. φb is the angle of the bar from the Galactic center-Sun baseline, while φa is angle of the minor axis of the bar. The
location of OLR and the Sun are marked as the black dashed circle and asterisk, respectively.

Fig. 8.— The top panel displays the derived axis ratio from the young (blue) and old (red) RC stars. The bottom panel shows the
axisymmetric azimuthal velocity derived from the young (blue) and old (red) RC stars. These quantities are derived given φb = 20◦. The
cyan and green lines are same as in Figure 6.

Fig. 9.— The top panel displays the peculiar velocities derived from the toy model of the perturbation of the density wave spiral arms.
The solid curves are for the mimic-young population and the dashed curves are for the mimic-old population. The black lines stand for the

mean radial velocity (cid:104)(cid:101)VR(cid:105), and the red lines are for (cid:104)(cid:101)Vφ(cid:105). The bottom panel shows the diﬀerential mean radial velocity (black) and mean

azimuthal velocity (red) between the mimic-young and old populations as functions of R. The blue dot-dashed lines indicate the location
of the spiral arms in the model.
