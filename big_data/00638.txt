The 120Sn(p,pα)116Cd reaction at 392 MeV is investigated with the distorted wave impulse approximation
(DWIA) framework. We show that this reaction is very peripheral mainly because of the strong absorption of α
by the reaction residue 116Cd, and the α-clustering on the nuclear surface can be probed clearly. We investigate
also the validity of the so-called factorization approximation that has frequently been used so far. It is shown
that the kinematics of α in the nuclear interior region is signiﬁcantly affected by the distortion of 116Cd, but it
has no effect on the reaction observables because of the strong absorption in that region.

INTRODUCTION

Nuclear clustering has been one of the main subjects in nu-
clear physics; for a recent review, see Ref. [1]. As a new topic,
α-clustering on the surface of heavy nuclei, Sn isotopes, is
theoretically predicted in Ref. [2]. This result itself is in-
teresting and important because it has been believed that α-
clustering is developed mainly in light nuclei, although some
indication for α-clustering in 40Ca and 44Ti was discussed [3].
Furthermore, the result gives a signiﬁcant impact on the nu-
clear equation of state [2].

As emphasized in Ref. [1], however, one should keep it in
mind that a large spectroscopic factor of α does not neces-
sarily indicate the α-clustering, because of the duality of the
mean-ﬁeld-type structure and the cluster structure [4]. On the
other hand, the localization of α in the nuclear surface region
is direct evidence of the α-clustering in a nucleus. In this view,
the α transfer reaction, (6Li,d) in particular, has been utilized
for investigating the α-clustering. Very recently, a three-body
reaction model with a microscopic cluster wave function was
applied to the 16O(6Li,d)20Ne reaction and the transfer cross
section was shown to be sensitive to the α distribution on the
nuclear surface of 20Ne [5].

In the present study, as an alternative way to the α trans-
fer reaction, we consider the proton-induced α knockout re-
action on 120Sn, and investigate how clearly it can probe
the α distribution in the surface region of 120Sn, i.e., the α-
clustering of 120Sn. We adopt the distorted wave impulse
approximation (DWIA) framework to describe the (p,pα) re-
action; DWIA has successfully been used in the analysis of
various nucleon knockout experiments [6–11]. In many pre-
ceding studies, however, the so-called factorization approxi-
mation, which factors out the nucleon-nucleon (N N ) transi-
tion amplitude in the evaluation of the total transition matrix
element of the knockout process, has been adopted. In this
paper we explicitly examine the validity of the factorization
approximation by means of the local semi classical approxi-
mation (LSCA) [12, 13] to the distorted waves. It was argued

∗yoshidak@rcnp.osaka-u.ac.jp

in Ref. [6] that the factorization approximation becomes ques-
tionable when the distortion effect is large. It is thus important
to examine its validity for the α knockout process for a heavy
nucleus, in which the distortion on α by the reaction residue
is expected to be very strong.

In Sec. II we describe the DWIA formalism for the (p,pα)
reaction, with introducing the LSCA that is a key prescription
for discussing the accuracy of the factorization approxima-
tion. In Sec. III we discuss the validity of the factorization
approximation in the 120Sn(p,pα)116Cd reaction at 392 MeV.
We then show that the 120Sn(p,pα)116Cd reaction probes the
α distribution in the surface region with high selectivity. Fi-
nally, a summary is given in Sec. IV.

II. FORMALISM

We consider the A(p,pα)B reaction in normal kinematics
in the DWIA framework. The incoming proton in the initial
channel is labelled as particle 0, and the outgoing proton and
α are particles 1 and 2, respectively. A (B) denotes the tar-
get (residual) nucleus. Ki and Ωi (i = 0, 1, 2) represent the
momentum and its solid angle, respectively, and Ei (Ti) is
the total (kinetic) energy of particle i. All quantities with and
without superscript L indicate that they are evaluated in the
center-of-mass (c.m.) and laboratory (L) frame, respectively.
The transition amplitude in the DWIA formalism is given

is the α-cluster wave
function. n, l, j, and m are, respectively, the principal quan-
tum number, the orbital angular momentum, the total angular
momentum, and its third component of α in the nucleus A.
The superscripts (+) and (−) specify the outgoing and incom-
ing boundary conditions on χi, respectively. The deﬁnition of
the coordinates is given in Fig. 1.

(24)

This prescription is called the factorization approximation.
One sees that this approximation is equivalent to use the
asymptotic momentum Ki instead of the local momentum
Ki(R) in Eq. (7), i.e.,

χi,Ki(R + ∆R) ≈ χi,Ki(R) eKi ·∆R,

(25)

which we call
the asymptotic momentum approximation
(AMA). Therefore the accuracy of the factorization approx-
imation can be judged, in principle, by that of the AMA.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Numerical inputs

α

For the bound state wave function ϕnljm

, we assume that
the α particle is bound in the 4S orbit in a Woods-Saxon po-
tential with R0 = 1.27 × A1/3 fm and a0 = 0.67 fm, where
R0 and a0 are the range and diffuseness parameters, respec-
tively; the depth of the potential is adjusted so as to reproduce
the α separation energy Sα of 120Sn; Sα = 4.81 MeV. The
spectroscopic factor for α is taken to be unity.

The EDAD1 parameter set of the Dirac phenomenol-
ogy [14] is adopted for the incoming and outgoing proton dis-
torting potentials. For the α-116Cd scattering in the ﬁnal state,
the global optical potential of Ref. [15] is employed. The ef-
fect of the nonlocality of the distorting potentials is taken into
account by multiplying the scattering waves by the Perey fac-
tor [16] FP (R) = [1 − µβ2/(22)U (R)]−1/2, where µ is the
reduced mass between the two scattering particles. The range
of nonlocality β for p (α) is taken to be 0.85 fm (0.2 fm) [17].
The differential cross section dσpα/dΩpα of the p-α scat-
tering is calculated by the single folding model [18] with the
phenomenological nuclear density of α and the Melbourne
N N g-matrix interaction [19]. As shown in Fig 2, the cal-
culated dσpα/dΩpα agrees very well with the experimental
data [20, 21] at 297 MeV and 500 MeV; we introduce no free
adjustable parameter.

We take the following kinematical condition on the
120Sn(p,pα)116Cd reaction at 392 MeV; the Madison con-
vention is adopted. The kinetic energy of particle 1 is ﬁxed
at 328 MeV and its emission angle is set to (θ1, φ1) =
(43.2◦, 0◦). As for particle 2, φ2 is ﬁxed at 180◦ and θ2 is var-
ied around 61◦; the kinetic energy T2 changes around 59 MeV
accordingly [22]. We always adopt the relativistic kinematics
for all the scattering particles in this study.

B. Validity of the LSCA and the AMA

The validity of the LSCA for the scattering of nucleon has
been examined in Refs. [13, 23] and it was concluded that
at energies higher than about 50 MeV, the LSCA works for
the propagation within 1.5 fm. Furthermore, at those energies
the AMA is found to work at almost the same level as of the
LSCA [23]. Considering the aforementioned kinematical con-
dition on particles 0 and 1, one may conclude that for proton
both the LSCA and the AMA are valid in the description of
the 120Sn(p,pα)116Cd reaction. On the other hand, such a val-
idation for particle 2, the knocked out α particle, has not been
done before.

In Fig. 3 we show the validity of the LSCA and the AMA
for χ(−)
with (θ2, φ2) = (61◦, 180◦), which corresponds to
2,K2
the quasi-free condition, i.e., the residual nucleus 116Cd is at
rest in the L frame. Figures 3(a) and 3(b) correspond to the
propagation from Ra ≡ (7 fm, 61◦, 180◦) and Rb ≡ (7 fm,
29◦, 0◦), respectively, in the spherical coordinate representa-
tion. In each panel the solid, dashed, and dotted lines show,
respectively, the real part of the exact wave function, that with
the LSCA, and that with the AMA. Since Ra (Rb) corre-
sponds to the foreside (rear side) of 116Cd for the outgoing
α, the distortion effect on α at Ra (Rb) is weak (strong).

With weak distortion, as shown in Fig. 3(a), both approx-
imations work well within about 0.5 fm of the propagation.
It should be noted that, with considering the range of the p-α
interaction of about 2 fm and the constant 1/(Aα + 1) = 1/5

the propagation from (7 fm,
61◦, 180◦) and (7 fm, 29◦, 0◦) are investigated, respectively;
(θ2, φ2) = (61◦, 180◦) is chosen for the kinematics of the α
particle.

In Figs. 3(a) and 3(b),

in front of s in Eq. (6), the LSCA and the AMA are required
to be valid for the propagation of about 0.4 fm. The two ap-
proximations are thus validated for the propagation from Ra.
In case of the strong distortion, as shown in Fig. 3(b) and sug-
gested in Ref. [6], the AMA cannot describe the behavior of
the exact scattering wave function; the dotted line is almost
constant, whereas the solid line shows clear variation. On the
other hand, the LSCA reproduces well the exact solution at
almost the same level as in the case of weak distortion. Thus,
one sees that the kinematics of α on the rear side of 116Cd
is signiﬁcantly changed from that in the asymptotic region by
the distorting potential of 116Cd; this kinematical change is
well traced by using the LSCA, i.e., the local momentum of
the α particle.

Therefore one can conclude that the LSCA works for the
α scattering wave function that is strongly distorted, whereas
the AMA not. This may cast doubt on the use of the factoriza-
tion approximation for the (p, pα) reaction investigated in the
present study. In the following subsections we discuss this in
view of the TDX.

FIG. 4:

and with the factorization approximation, respectively. One
sees from the good agreement between the solid and dashed
lines that the factorization approximation, or equivalently, the
AMA, affects very little the TDX, although the AMA for α is
shown to be invalid in the rear-side region with respect to the
emitting direction of α. This is due to the strong absorption of
α in that region as shown in Sec. III D.

α

The dotted line in Fig. 4 represents the result of the plane
wave impulse approximation (PWIA) calculation divided by
200. The renormalization factor 1/200 shows the strong ab-
sorption mainly caused by the α-116Cd distorting potential.
In the PWIA, the TDX is essentially proportional to the ab-
solute square of the Fourier transform of the α distribution
inside 120Sn. Since we take a 4S state, the dashed line
ϕnljm
in Fig. 5 below, the TDX calculated with the PWIA shows
an oscillation pattern accordingly. The shape of the TDX
calculated with the DWIA is quite different from that with
the PWIA. The widening of the width of the TDX caused by
distortion suggests that, because of the uncertainty principle,
is probed by the (p, pα) reac-
only a limited region of ϕnljm
α
tion, as shown in Sec. III D.

It should be noted that the slight shift of the peak of the
TDX with the DWIA from pR = 0 is understood by the shift
of the momentum of particles 2 due to the real part of the
distorting potential [24].

D. Probed region of α in 120Sn by the (p,pα) reaction

one can understand naturally the reason why the AMA is al-
lowed in the calculation of the TDX and also the mechanism
that makes the width of the TDX wider when the distortion is
taken into account.

also plotted by the dashed line. One sees that the magnitude of
I(R) is strongly suppressed in the interior region, R <∼ 6 fm,
mainly because of the absorption due to the α-116Cd distorting
potential.

Furthermore, in Fig. 6 the calculated TDXs with the min-
imum value of the integration range of R; Rmin = 0, 6, 7, 8

sult shows that the (p,pα) reaction on heavy nuclei probes the

the amplitude is located in the foreside region with R = 6–
9 fm, where χ(−)
2,K2(R) is not absorbed and ϕα(R) has a ﬁnite
amplitude. Figure 7 shows that the (p, pα) reaction has selec-
tivity not only in the radius but also the direction of the target
nucleus. In fact, it is found that about 80% of the TDX comes
from the region x < 0 and 0◦ < θ < 120◦, where θ is the
polar angle of R; the solid lines in Fig. 7 show the boundaries
of this region on the z-x plane.

IV. SUMMARY

We have examined the 120Sn(p,pα)116Cd reaction at
392 MeV in the DWIA framework. It was clariﬁed that the so-
called factorization approximation adopted in many preced-
ing studies is equivalent to the AMA to the distorted waves,
which is a further simpliﬁcation of the LSCA. Although the
AMA does not work for the propagation of α in the region
where the nuclear deﬂection is signiﬁcant, it does not affect
the TDX because of the strong absorption in that region. In

other words, the integrand of the transition matrix has a con-
tribution only in the region where the AMA works well. As
a result, the factorization approximation was veriﬁed for the
calculation of the TDX of the (p, pα) reaction. It should be
kept in mind, however, that the inaccuracy of the AMA may
affect the TDX if a scattering particle feels a potential hav-
ing a strong real part and a weak imaginary part; this can be
realized, for instance, for nucleon scattering at lower energies.
The strong absorption due to the α-116Cd distorting poten-
tial makes the (p, pα) reaction very peripheral, which allows
one to clearly probe the α-clustering of nuclei. Furthermore,
the (p, pα) reaction has high selectivity also in the direction
of the target nucleus; only the foreside region with respect to
the emitting α with the radius of 6–9 fm is probed.

Validation of the on-shell approximation to the p-α transi-

tion amplitude will be important for more reliable description
of the knockout processes.
