Young star clusters in the outer disks of LITTLE THINGS dwarf

irregular galaxies

ABSTRACT

We examine F UV images of the LITTLE THINGS sample of nearby dwarf
irregular (dIrr) and Blue Compact Dwarf (BCD) galaxies to identify distinct
young regions in their far outer disks. We use these data, obtained with the
Galaxy Evolution Explorer satellite, to determine the furthest radius at which
in situ star formation can currently be identiﬁed. The F UV knots are found at
distances from the center of the galaxies of 1 to 8 disk scale lengths and have
ages of ≤ 20 Myrs and masses of 20 M⊙ to 1 × 105 M⊙. The presence of young
clusters and OB associations in the outer disks of dwarf galaxies shows that dIrrs
do have star formation taking place there in spite of the extreme nature of the
environment. Most regions are found where the H i surface density is ∼ 1 M⊙
pc−2, although both the H i and dispersed old stars go out much further. This
limiting density suggests a cutoﬀ in the ability to form distinct OB associations
and perhaps even stars. We compare the star formation rates in the F UV regions
to the average rates expected at their radii and beyond from the observed gas,
using the conventional correlation for gas-rich regions. The localized rates are
typically 10% of the expected average rates for the outer disks. Either star
formation in dIrrs at surface densities < 1 M⊙ pc−2 occurs without forming
distinct associations, or the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation over-predicts the rate
beyond this point. In the latter case, the stellar disks in the far-outer parts of
dIrrs result from scattering of stars from the inner disk.

Introduction

Star formation in dwarf irregular galaxies (dIrrs ) is diﬃcult to understand because gas
densities are low, but this is particularly true in the outer parts where the gas densities

are even lower than in the central regions. There, the standard 2-dimensional Toomre
(1964) gravitational instability parameter for the gas, suggested by Kennicutt (1989) as
an important parameter for star formation, predicts that the gas is highly stable against
collapse into star-forming clouds (Hunter et al. 2011). Yet, F UV emission, a signpost of
recent star formation, is detected even into the outer disks.

In a deep-imaging study, we obtained V -band and Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX;
Martin et al. 2005) F UV images of 4 dIrr galaxies and one Blue Compact Dwarf (BCD),
and B-band images for 3 of the dIrrs (Hunter et al. 2011). Through surface photometry we
traced stellar disks in these images to µV ∼ 30 mag arcsec−2. We found that the stellar
surface brightness in both V and F UV continues exponentially as far out as we can measure
(see also Bellazzini et al. 2014). The presence of F UV emission into the outer disk suggests
a continuity of star formation with radius even though the outer gas is stable against two-
dimensional gravitational collapse in the conventional model (Elmegreen & Hunter 2015).

In spiral galaxies, numerical simulations show that spiral arms are capable of scattering
stars into the outer disks (Ro˘skar et al. 2008; Minchev et al. 2012; Radburn-Smith et al.
2012), and this could be a signiﬁcant source of the stellar populations there. However, dIrrs
do not have spiral arms. Are outer disks of dIrrs populated primarily through stars scattered
from the inside out or from in situ star formation? Are the outer parts of dIrrs from halos
and not disks (Martin-Navarro et al. 2014)? If star formation is taking place in the outer
parts of dIrrs, then there should be young F UV -bright star clusters, not just diﬀuse F UV
emission. We have previously identiﬁed clusters and associations to a radius of a few disk
scale lengths (Melena et al. 2009). Here we use F UV images to search for young star clusters
and OB associations in the far outer regions of a larger sample of nearby dIrr galaxies. Since
scattering takes longer than the ages of young clusters and strong scattering may destroy
clusters (but see Carraro et al. 2006), this search is a good test for in situ star formation in
outer disks.

We also examine the environments for star formation in the far outer parts of these
galaxies (§4). The pressure and average density are low, gravity is weak, and the dynamical
time is long. Most of the identiﬁed regions occur near the radius where the average gas surface
density drops below ∼ 1 M⊙ pc−2, suggesting a cutoﬀ or slowdown at lower densities. The
gas and distributed stellar population go further than this. To test whether the outer disk
might be built up from dispersed regions like those we observe, we compare in §5 the star
formation rates (SFRs) in the F UV regions to the average rates expected in the outer disks
from the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation (Kennicutt & Evans 2012).

2. Sample, Data, and Procedure

The sample of galaxies is taken from LITTLE THINGS (Local Irregulars That Trace
Luminosity Extremes, The H i Nearby Galaxy Survey, Hunter et al. 2012). This is a multi-
wavelength survey of nearby (< 10.3 Mpc) dIrr galaxies and Blue Compact Dwarfs (BCDs),
which builds on the THINGS project, whose emphasis was on nearby spirals (Walter et al.
2008). The galaxies and a few key parameters are listed in Table 1. The galaxies Haro 29,
Haro 36, Mrk 178, and VIIZw 403, which appear at the end of the table, are classiﬁed as
BCDs. NGC 3738, classiﬁed as a dIrr, has characteristics, such as a central concentration of
stars, star formation, and gas, that are similar to BCDs, and so we will include it with the
BCDs when that group is singled out.

The LITTLE THINGS sample was chosen to be relatively isolated because we are in-
vestigating internal processes of star formation. None of the galaxies are companions to
large spiral galaxies, members of dense clusters, or obviously engaged in an interaction with
another galaxy. Most are, however, members of groups and so other galaxies are around.
In addition a few galaxies and particularly the BCDs (NGC 1569, IC 10, Haro 29, Haro 36,
Mrk 178, VIIZw 403) are undergoing bursts of star formation that may have been triggered
by some sort of external process, including mergers (Nidever et al. 2013; Ashley et al. 2013,
2014). Hunter & Elmegreen (2004) gives the nearest neighbor to each galaxy and their sep-
aration. The non-starburst LITTLE THINGS galaxies are 110-1100 kpc from their nearest
known neighbor, with a median separation of 480 kpc. The starburst sub-sample is at a
comparable range of distances – 240-900 kpc with a median separation of 450 kpc. There-
fore, we expect that for most of the galaxies the extra-galactic environment is not a factor
in determining the extent of star-formation in the systems.

We used F UV (1516 ˚A) images obtained by GALEX (Melena et al. 2009; Hunter et al.
2010, 2011; Zhang et al. 2012) to identify knots of emission in the outer disks of each galaxy.
In order to better distinguish knots from the wide-spread diﬀuse emission, we subtracted
the stellar continuum from each F UV image using the V -band image. The F UV image was
geometrically transformed to match the pixel scale and dimensions of the V -band image.
The V -band image was scaled and Gaussian-smoothed so that, as well as possible, when it
was subtracted from the F UV image, the diﬀuse emission disappeared.

In order to select F UV knots that we were conﬁdent belonged to the galaxy, we used
F UV − NUV false-color pictures produced by the GALEX pipeline to pick out bright, blue
knots that stood out compared to the surrounding background/foreground populations. In
particular we were looking at the density of comparably bright and blue objects well beyond
the galaxy. The shape of the object is also a clue:
is it resolved compared to a star or
lumpy? As a training exercise, we began with a few galaxies also studied by Melena et al.

(2009), and compared our identiﬁcations of individual regions with theirs. The distance
to the furthest knot from the center of the galaxy in the plane of the galaxy, Rknot, was
determined by comparing the location of the knot to ellipses superposed that were used
for surface photometry. The major axis and minor-to-major axis ratio of the ellipses were
determined for the galaxy from the V -band image. We then identiﬁed the annulus or ellipse
boundary at which the F UV knot fell. The Rknot are given in Table 1, along with the ratios
of Rknot to the disk scale length, RD, and to the break radius, RBr. The break radius is
the radius at which the exponential stellar surface brightness proﬁle changes slope. Dwarf
irregular galaxies, despite having irregular and sporadic star formation, have well-behaved
exponential stellar disk proﬁles, even out to 6-10RD (Saha et al. 2010; Hunter et al. 2011;
Bellazzini et al. 2014). These azimuthally-averaged proﬁles, like those in spirals, often show
abrupt breaks, most often dropping in brightness into the outer disk more steeply than in
the interior disk (Type II proﬁles) but occasionally dropping less steeply (Type III). Surface
brightness proﬁles without breaks (Type I) are actually rare. RD and RBr were taken from
Herrmann et al. (2013). Two galaxies (DDO 47, DDO 210) do not have breaks in their
exponential disk surface brightness proﬁles.

The F UV regions are identiﬁed on the F UV images shown in Figure 1, along with the
H i shown as contours from the integrated H i maps. The H i extends much further than
the outermost F UV regions, which are usually located just inside the 5th or 6th contour,
counting inwards from the outermost one. The H i column density there is 5 − 10 × 1020
atoms cm−2, which corresponds to 2.7 − 5.4 M⊙ pc−2 assuming a mean atomic weight of 1.36
times the Hydrogen mass. The H i maps are irregular, as expected for the dIrr morphology,
and the F UV regions are often associated with one of these irregularities, indicating the
presence of a local gas concentration. We show in §3.3 that the average H i density at the
radius of the F UV region is several times less than this local density.

3. Analysis

3.1. Characteristics of the F UV regions

We have estimated ages and masses of the knots by ﬁtting aperture photometry from
the F UV , NUV , U, B, and V images (Hunter & Elmegreen 2006). We determined the
brightness of the underlying stellar disk for subtraction from the region photometry for most
of the regions using the mode of the counts in an annulus 5 pixels (1.35′′ to 5.67′′) wide and
2 pixels (0.54′′ to 4.6′′) in radius beyond the photometric aperture. Since the regions are
generally in the far outer parts of the disk, they are not crowded and aperture photometry
is adequate. For some galaxies, such as those in which the star formation is centrally con-

Fig. 1.— F UV images of the galaxies in our sample. The red circle outlines the distinct
F UV region belonging to the galaxy that we considered to be at the furthest radius in the
plane of the galaxy. The circle has a radius of 15′′ unless the aperture used for photometry
of the region (given in Table 2) is larger; then the aperture radius is used. The blue contours
are of the integrated natural-weighted H i map of the galaxy from Hunter et al. (2012) and
outline column densities of 5, 30, 100, 300, 500, 1000, and 3000×1018 atoms cm−2. The blue
ellipse in the bottom right of each galaxy panel outlines the FWHM of the H i beam (major
axis, minor axis, and position angle). (The complete ﬁgure set (7 pages) is available in the
online journal).

centrated, the F UV regions are too crowded with other regions for an annulus around the
region to give a reliable measure of underlying galaxy. For these galaxies (DDO 53, DDO
101, M81dwA, NGC 3738, NGC 4163, Haro 29, Haro 36, VIIZw 403), we determined the
background from nearby areas at approximately the same disk surface brightness as that
where the F UV region was found. No UBV photometry was available from our data for the
F UV region in NGC 6822. The aperture radius, colors, and E(B − V ) used for reddening
corrections are given in Table 2.

E(B −V ) includes foreground reddening from Burstein & Heiles (1984) and 0.05 mag for
internal reddening. The internal reddening is half that determined from Balmer decrements
in H ii regions in a sample of 39 dIrr galaxies, as described in Hunter et al. (2010). The
expectation is that these stars are not as embedded as one would ﬁnd in H ii regions. Fur-
thermore, since most of these regions are in the outer disks of the dwarfs, extinction due to
dust is expected to be minor. We use the reddening law of Cardelli et al. (1989) to produce
the extinction in each optical ﬁlter. For the GALEX ﬁlters, we use AF U V = 8.24E(B − V )
and AN U V = 7.39E(B − V ) taken from Wyder et al. (2007) and discussed in relation to the
LITTLE THINGS dwarfs by Hunter et al. (2010).

To model the ages and determine masses, we compared the integrated cluster photom-
etry with cluster evolutionary models of Leitherer et al. (1999). These models trace the
evolution of a 106 M⊙ cluster over time, assuming a Salpeter (1955) stellar initial mass func-
tion from 0.1 to 100 M⊙. We used the models for Z = 0.004 metallicity, since this is typical
of the LITTLE THINGS dwarfs. See Billett et al. (2002) and Hunter et al. (2003) for more
details on our color ﬁtting procedure.

The ages and masses of the clusters are given in Table 2, values are shown as histograms
in Figures 2 and 3, and mass is plotted against age in Figure 4. The uncertainties in the ages
and masses represent the range of ages allowed by the colors. The ages are all less than 20
Myrs. Young ages are expected since the regions were selected to be bright knots of F UV
emission. Masses range from 20 M⊙ to 1.3 × 105 M⊙. There is no correlation between age
or mass and distance from the center of the galaxy.

Eight of the galaxies in our sample were also analyzed by Melena et al. (2009). Working
from the NUV images, they identiﬁed, not just the furthest regions, but all of the discrete
regions in the galaxies. The ensembles of clusters of these 8 galaxies extended to radii that
were comparable to ours: 0.7-1.1 times the radii where we identiﬁed our furthest F UV knots.
Their ensembles included older clusters, but the masses of our regions are within the range
of the masses found by Melena et al. (2009) out at their furthest radius. The exceptions
are DDO 70 and DDO 210 which have masses that are lower by a factor of 15 and 20,
respectively, in our study. Thus, we conclude that the regions we identiﬁed in our study are

3.2. Locations of the F UV regions

Histograms of the ratios Rknot/RD and Rknot/RBr are shown in Figure 5. There is
structure due to star formation present in almost all of the outer disks. All of the furthest
F UV knots in the dIrr galaxies are beyond one disk scale length and 69% are beyond 2RD.
A few (DDO 70 and NGC 4214) are out as far as 7-8RD. In terms of the break in the V -band
surface brightness proﬁles, in 57% of the dIrr galaxies the furthest F UV knots are at radii
≤2RBr, and so the regions are found roughly near the break. In two of the galaxies (DDO
75 and NGC 6822) the regions are found around 10RBr.

NGC 6822 is one of the extreme dIrr galaxies with a Rknot/RBr ratio of 10. The F UV
region is located in an H i cloud to the northwest of the galaxy center at a distance of 4.6
kpc. This region had been suggested to be a companion that is interacting with NGC 6822
(de Blok & Walter 2000; Komiyama et al. 2003), but an HST study of the stellar populations
of this region and others along the H i extent found that the star formation histories of all
six of their positions are similar over the past 500 Myr (Cannon et al. 2012). Cannon et al.
(2012) argue that the “companion” has an old stellar population that is like that of the
extended halo of NGC 6822. Therefore, we include it here as the furthest F UV region in
NGC 6822.

DDO 75 is also a dIrr with a Rknot/RBr ratio of 10, but it also has a peculiar surface
brightness proﬁle. The V -band surface brightness proﬁle is ﬂat to mildly increasing in
brightness from the center to 0.7 kpc, and then the surface brightness drops like a normal
exponential proﬁle to a radius of 1.3 kpc (Herrmann et al. 2013). After that, as the surface
brightness becomes fainter with radius, there are superposed up and down wiggles in the
surface brightness proﬁle (Bellazzini et al. 2014). Therefore, RD may not be as well deﬁned
as it is in other galaxies.

The two dIrrs with the highest Rknot/RD ratios are DDO 70 and NGC 4214. The
surface brightness proﬁle of DDO 70 is also ﬂat but only to a radius of 0.1 kpc and then is
well-behaved after that (Bellazzini et al. 2014). NGC 4214 has a steeper proﬁle in the inner
disk, to a radius of 0.8 kpc. Beyond that radius, the surface brightness drops as a normal
exponential. In spite of these small peculiarities, it is not obvious what is special about DDO
70 and NGC 4214 that they would have F UV knots at such large RD; there are other dwarfs
that are more peculiar than these with smaller Rknot/RD.

For the BCDs, 43% of the furthest F UV regions are beyond 2RD and 80% are found
relatively near the break radius, with only one further out at 3-4RBr. Statistics are poor,
of course, with only ﬁve BCDs. Nevertheless, we expect BCDs to be more centrally concen-
trated than normal dIrrs, and their Rknot are roughly in agreement with that. The BCDs in

the LITTLE THINGS sample have also been shown to likely be the result of an interaction

Fig. 6.— Rknot/RD plotted versus ∆PA, the diﬀerence between the position angle of the
major axis of the stellar disk, determined from V -band images, and the position angle of the
H i kinematics, determined from ﬁts to the bulk velocity ﬁeld of the gas (Oh et al. 2015).
We assume an uncertainty in the optically derived PA of 2◦ and the uncertainty in the H i
kinematics is from Oh et al. (2015).

3.3. Relationships of F UV regions to other galactic characteristics

To explore a potential connection between large-scale structural peculiarities and the
extended nature of star formation in dwarfs, we look at the relationship between Rknot/RD
and diﬀerences between optical and H i kinematic position angles. The position angle of
the optical major axis was determined from smoothed outer isophotes of the V -band images
(Hunter & Elmegreen 2006), and the H i kinematic major axis was determined from iterative
ﬁts to the bulk velocity ﬁeld of the gas (Oh et al. 2015). Twenty-six of the LITTLE THINGS
galaxies were in the study by Oh et al. (2015) and all but two are included in this study. We
would expect these two position angles - one describing the stellar disk and one describing
the gas disk – to be co-located, but over half of the LITTLE THINGS galaxies have ∆PA
that are larger than 20◦. The large diﬀerences could represent some peculiarity of the galaxy
structure.
In Figure 6 we plot Rknot/RD as a function of the diﬀerence in the position
angles. We ﬁnd that galaxies with large ∆PA are not distinguished in terms of Rknot/RD
compared to those with small ∆PA, although there is a decline in the upper envelope such
that Rknot/RD declines as ∆PA increases.

Fig. 7.— Rknot/RD plotted versus the log of the star formation rate determined from the
integrated F UV luminosity (Hunter et al. 2010; Zhang et al. 2012). The SFR is normalized
to the area of the galaxy within one disk scale length: πR2
D. The uncertainties in the SFRF U V
are smaller than the point size and are not plotted.

D

In Figure 7 we plot Rknot/RD as a function of the galactic integrated SFR determined
(M⊙yr−1
from the F UV luminosity (Hunter et al. 2010; Zhang et al. 2012):
kpc−2). The SFR is normalized to the area contained within one disk scale length. The
thought here is that if a galaxy has a higher SFR, it might also have more extended star
formation. In Figure 7 we see that, with one exception, the galaxies with the highest SFRs
do also have the furthest F UV knots in terms of disk scale lengths. In addition, the galaxies
with lowest SFRs have among the lower Rknot/RD ratios. However, the galaxies in between
these extremes display a range of SFRs and a range of Rknot/RD without a clear trend.

log SFRF U V

D

To explore the relationship between the extent of the F UV knots and the average gas
densities at that radius, we plot Rknot/RD against the log of the azimuthally-averaged H i
surface density ΣHI (Hunter et al. 2012) at the radius of Rknot in Figure 8. There is no trend
of Rknot/RD with ΣHI , but most points are centered around a value of 1 M⊙pc−2.

– 16 –

Fig. 8.— Rknot/RD plotted versus the log of the azimuthally-averaged H i surface density
(Hunter et al. 2012) at the radius of Rknot. The uncertainties in ΣHI are determined from
the rms in the integrated H i map and the number of beams within the annulus over which an
average was taken. The rms in the integrated H i map was determined from the uncertainty
in individual channels and an assumed average number of channels contributing to each pixel
(see de Blok et al. 2008).

4. Environment for star formation near the knots

Fifteen galaxies in the present study have outer star formation knots within the radial
range of the survey of dIrr in Elmegreen & Hunter (2015), for which we determined gas
column densities, scale heights, midplane densities, and Toomre Q values as a function of
radius for gas and stars. The scale heights and densities came from solutions to the vertical
equilibrium of a three component ﬂuid consisting of gas, stars, and dark matter, using
observed velocity dispersions and column densities. The Q values also included the observed
rotation curves to give the epicyclic frequency. Figures 9 and 10 show histograms of these
quantities for gas and stars, respectively, at the radii of the F UV knots. Comparing the two
ﬁgures, the average densities and column densities for the stars are much lower than for the
gas at these radii, emphasizing that the F UV knots are in gas-dominated regions. Q is high
for both gas and stars, but higher for stars because of the lower stellar surface densities. The
scale heights at these radii are about the same for the two components.

The average environment at the radius of an F UV region is important for understanding

how the gas ﬁrst got concentrated into a cloud to begin the process of star formation.
H i excesses near the identiﬁed regions are sometimes directly evident as deformations in
the H i contours in Figure 1. Almost all of the F UV knots occur in larger-scale F UV
structures too. These large-scale structures typically have a size comparable to the disk
scale length. Their formation would presumably involve processes that operate on the local
average dynamical time, which depends on the average midplane density.
In these far-
outer regions, the average midplane density is typically 10 or more times lower than the gas
density in the solar neighborhood (which is about 1 cm−3) as a result of both the low H i
surface density and the large gas scale height from weak gravity (Fig. 9). Consequently, the
dynamical time over the region that the star-forming gas came from was long: tﬀ = 140 Myr
for midplane gas density ngas at the typical value of 0.1 cm−3. The free fall time is taken
to be tﬀ = (3π/32Gρ)1/2 for ρ = 1.36ngasmH and mH = 1.67 × 10−24 g. This time is 20
times the average age of the knots, which is 7 Myr from Table 2. Unless there is a relatively
dense layer of undetected molecular gas near the midplane or some triggering event like an
extragalactic cloud impact, the formation of the observed knots by large-scale dynamical
processes requires a relatively long time. This suggests there was a threshold density or
column density for the cluster to form so the cloud could grow without early disruption from
the ﬁrst few stars.

A threshold surface density for star formation in the outer parts of dIrr galaxies is most
likely not the same as that in the solar neighborhood (e.g., Lada et al. 2010) because the
pressures and metallicities in dIrrs are much lower. The threshold column density for strong
self-gravity in a cloud scales as the square root of the boundary pressure, with collapse
proceeding exponentially slower as P/(GΣ2
gas) increases (Padoan et al. 2012). With P lower
by a factor of 10, the threshold column density for strong gravity in our case should be
lower by a factor of about 3. That would make it Σthresh ∼ 40 M⊙ pc−2 inside the star-
forming region of a cloud, if we take the solar neighborhood threshold as 116 M⊙ pc−2 from
Lada et al. (2010). Another threshold involves opacity and the formation of strong coolants,
like CO. The opacity threshold, measured in terms of a mass column density threshold,
scales inversely with metallicity, and the metallicities for these dIrrs are lower than solar by
a factor of about 8. Thus the mass column density for an opacity threshold should be 8 times
larger in these dIrrs than in the solar neighborhood. If ∼ 1.5 mag is the local threshold for
CO formation (Glover & Clark 2012), then the corresponding surface density of gas would
be 230 M⊙ pc−2 for the clouds that formed our F UV knots. This is what we observe for
CO emission in the dIrr WLM, where the metallicity has this value (Rubio et al. 2015). If
both strong self-gravity and high extinction are required for star formation, then the larger
of these two thresholds should apply. However, if strong self-gravity alone is required and
the opacity threshold automatically follows during the ensuing collapse, then only the lower

– 20 –

threshold is required. This cloud threshold, ∼ 40 M⊙ pc−2, is a factor of ∼ 13 larger than
the average surface density of H i at the radius of the F UV knots, which is ∼ 3 M⊙ pc−2
from Figures 8 and 9. A factor of 13 increase in column density corresponds to a factor of
131/2 ∼ 3.6 contraction in two dimensions. This is about the same factor that clouds in the
solar neighborhood would have to contract if the cloud threshold for star formation always
scales with the square root of the ambient pressure. In this sense, star formation in outer
dIrr disks may not be qualitatively diﬀerent from other star formation.

This picture of star formation at the local dynamical rate changes if a particular event
was triggered by something rapid, such as an extragalactic cloud impact. Some BCDs
and extremely low-metallicity dwarf galaxies have single dominant star-forming regions with
lower metallicities than in the rest of the galaxy (S´anchez Almeida et al. 2013, 2014, 2015).
These regions could be the sites of extragalactic cloud impacts with low metallicities from
nearly pristine gas. One example, Kiso 5639 (Elmegreen et al. 2016), has a star formation
rate surface density in a ∼ 800 pc region that is ∼ 5× larger than the value expected from
the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation at the likely gas surface density. The total young mass there
is ∼ 106 M⊙ for a ∼ 108 M⊙ galaxy. These regions are all much larger and brighter than the
F UV regions studied here, which look more typical for disk galaxies, although they formed
at extremely low gas densities.

5. Does star formation occur in the far-outer regions?

One of the motivations for the present study was to determine if star formation could
account for the outer F UV disks of dIrr galaxies, as opposed to stellar scattering from the
inner disk. Here we compare the star formation rate inside each F UV knot, obtained from
the ratio of the knot mass to the age, to the total rate inside an annulus of width RD at
the radius of the knot, as determined from the average Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation for
dIrrs at the local gas surface density (Elmegreen & Hunter 2015). If the total rate in the
small knot is comparable to the total rate expected from the gas in the annulus, which is
based on large-scale averages from many other observations, then one might conclude that
star-forming regions like these can generally populate outer disks. If the annular rate is much
larger than the local rate, then either we are missing F UV regions that are too small, faint,
or dispersed to detect (e.g., Pellerin et al. 2008), or the average KS relation over-estimates
the star formation rate at and below a gas surface density of ∼ 1 M⊙ pc−2, where our F UV
regions begin to disappear.

Such an over-estimate would imply that star formation virtually stops below ∼ 1 M⊙
pc−2, according to our understanding of conventional processes (e.g., Kennicutt & Evans

– 21 –

2012). In that case, stellar scattering from the inner disk would seem to be important in
ﬁlling the outer disk with stars. The outer disks have relatively smooth exponential radial
proﬁles in V -band down to ∼ 0.1 M⊙ pc−1 or lower (Herrmann et al. 2013). This is below
the average stellar surface density at the radius of the F UV regions, as shown in Figure 10.

The left-hand panel of Figure 11 shows a histogram of star formation rates in the F UV
knots. There is a wide range of rates, primarily because the regions vary a lot in mass and
age. The middle panel shows a histogram of the ratio of the theoretical star formation rate
in an annulus of width RD around a knot to the rate in the knot. The right-hand panel
shows the ratio of the theoretical rate integrated from the knot radius to inﬁnity compared
to the knot rate. For the theory, we use the expression

ΣSFR = 1.7 × 10−5Σ2

gas M⊙ Myr−1 pc−2

for H i surface density Σgas in M⊙ pc−2. This implies that in the annulus,

SF R = 2πRknotRDΣSFR M⊙ Myr−1

and for the integral

SF R = 2πRD (RD + Rknot) ΣSFR M⊙ Myr−1.

(1)

(2)

(3)

The theoretical rate follows from the expression ΣSFR = ǫﬀΣgas/tﬀ for a pure gas disk after
substituting ρ = Σgas/(2H) and H = σ2/(πGΣgas) inside the equation for free fall time given
in the previous section, i.e.,

1/tﬀ = 4GΣgas/[31/2σ].

(4)

The theoretical rate compares well with observations of 20 dIrr galaxies if ǫﬀ = 0.01 and
the velocity dispersion is the observed value of σ ∼ 6 km s−1 (Elmegreen & Hunter 2015;
Elmegreen 2015). It also agrees with observations in the outer parts of spiral galaxies, which
are gas-dominated like the dIrrs (Elmegreen 2015). This is the steep part of the KS relation,
beyond the main disks of spirals, where atoms dominate molecules, gas dominates stars,
and the total consumption time approaches 100 Gyrs (Bigiel et al. 2008, 2010). Note that
equation (4) gives tﬀ = 590 Myr for Σgas = 1 M⊙ pc−2 and σ = 6 km s−1, so the gas
consumption time would be tﬀ/ǫ = 59 Gyr with ǫ = 0.01. For equation (3), we assume that
the gas disk has an exponential radial proﬁle with a scale length twice that of the V -band
disk, as found for the 20 dIrrs and for the outer parts of 23 blue spirals by Wang et al. (2014).

The middle and right-hand panels in Figure 11 suggest that the annuli around the
knots and the outer disks would have ∼ 8× larger star formation rates than the knots have
now, given the KS relation for average rates extrapolated to the local average gas surface
densities around the knots. Figure 12 illustrates this point by plotting the two theoretical

are for the annulus and blue dots are for the outer disk. For the largest knots the two
rates agree well, but for the smallest knots, the star formation rates fall short of the outer-
disk expectations by a factor of ∼ 10. As mentioned above, this shortfall could be because
smaller, fainter and more dispersed regions cannot be seen in our data, or because the SFR
is actually below the extrapolated KS relation at ∼ 1 M⊙ pc−2.

6. Summary

We have identiﬁed on GALEX images the furthest out distinct F UV knot in the LITTLE
THINGS sample of dIrr and BCD galaxies that we are conﬁdent belong to the galaxy. These
knots are found at distances from the center of the galaxies of 1 to 8 disk scale lengths and
have ages of ≤ 20 Myrs and masses of 20 M⊙ to 1 × 105 M⊙. The presence of young clusters
in the outer disks of dwarf galaxies shows that dIrrs do have in situ star formation taking
place in their outer disks. Most regions are found around an H i surface density of 1 M⊙
pc−2, making this look like a threshold for the formation of prominent OB associations.

The environments of these remote star-forming regions are extreme compared to the
solar neighborhood and inner Milky Way (§4), or even compared to the inner parts of dIrr
galaxies. The average pressures and midplane densities are lower by a factor of ∼ 10, the disks

Fig. 12.— The theoretical star formation rates are plotted versus the average rate in the
corresponding F UV knot. The blue points for the outer disk integral are slightly higher
than the red points for an annulus around the knot. The line is the unity relation. The rates
are equal for the largest knots, suggesting that star-forming regions like these could build
up the outer disk. The smallest knots cannot account for the outer disks in their galaxies,
but we could be missing similar knots because of faintness, or these particular knots could
be uncharacteristically small for their galaxies.

are relatively thick compared to the radial extents (Hodge & Hitchcock 1966; van den Bergh
1988; Elmegreen & Hunter 2015), and the metallicities are ∼ 8 times lower. Consequently,
self-gravity is weak in the interstellar medium, cloud contraction times are long, ∼ 100 Myr
or more, and molecules are sparse. Moreover, the threshold column density for strong gravity
inside clouds should be ∼ 3 times lower than it is locally, placing this collapse threshold ﬁrmly
in the optically thin regime where atomic gas should still dominate. Presumably molecules
form after the collapse begins (Glover & Clark 2012; Krumholz 2012).

The star formation rates in the most remote F UV knots fall short by a factor of ∼ 8 of
the average rates obtained from the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation for these types of regions.
Only for the most massive F UV knots are the rates comparable. Either we are missing other
discrete star-forming regions owing to faintness or rapid dispersal, or the star formation rate
drops below the KS relation for outer disks starting at around ∼ 1 M⊙ pc−2. In the latter
case, stellar scattering from the inner disk would have to ﬁll the outer disks with stars, which
go out much further than the last F UV knot seen here.
