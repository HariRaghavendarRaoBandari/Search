We use the Koashi-Imoto decomposition of the degrees of freedom of joint initial states to inves-
tigate the reduced dynamics. We show that a subset of joint initial states guarantees completely
positive reduced dynamics, if and only if the system privately owns all quantum degrees of freedom
and can locally access the classical degrees of freedom, without disturbing all joint initial states in
the given subset. Furthermore, we show that the quantum mutual information for such kinds of
states must be independent of the quantum degrees of freedom.

As the standard tool mathematically describing quan-
tum operations and quantum channels, the completely
positive (CP) linear maps between quantum states are
of great importance in quantum information processing
and the dynamics of open quantum systems [1–7]. It is
well known that for uncorrelated joint initial states with
a ﬁxed environmental state, the reduced dynamical maps
for open quantum systems from the initial time to any
later time are always CP, no matter what the interaction
is [4–7]. For correlated joint initial states, characteriz-
ing the reduced dynamical maps is much more compli-
cated [8–14], and until now not too much about it has
been known.

However, restricting to some special subsets of (corre-
lated) joint initial states, the reduced dynamical maps
can be described by CP linear maps [8, 9], so that many
elegant structures and features of CP linear maps can
be directly applied to study the reduced dynamics, e.g.,
the non-Markovianity based on indivisibility of CP dy-
namical maps [15–18]. Some eﬀorts have been devoted
to pursue a complete characterization of the structure of
subsets of joint initial states that guarantee CP reduced
dynamics for any joint unitary evolution [19–25].
It is
particularly concerned whether the system-environment
correlations are relevant or not [19–22, 24], since joint ini-
tial states that have only classical correlations was shown
to lead to CP reduced dynamics [19]. Recently, it was
shown that the purely classical correlations is not nec-
essary for the CP reduced dynamics, and in principle
any kind of correlation can be present in the joint initial
states guaranteeing CP reduced dynamics [21, 22]. An
alternative approach is to consider the families of joint
initial states that are post-selected via an ancillary from
an ancillary-system-environment tripartite state. In such
a case, the reduced dynamics is CP if and only if the tri-
partite state is a short quantum Markov chain [23]. Yet
despite all that, a structure theory of subsets of joint ini-
tial states guaranteeing CP reduced dynamics is still not
available.

In this paper, we use the Koashi-Imoto (KI) decompo-

sition to tackle this question. The KI decomposition is
an elegant way to characterize the structure of subsets
of quantum states [26]. In terms of how the information
carried by individual states can be accessed by the oper-
ations that leave invariant all states in the given subset,
the KI decomposition classiﬁes the degrees of freedom
of individual states into three parts: the quantum part
is inaccessible, the classical part is read-only, and the
redundant part is the same for all states in the given
subset [26]. We show that a subset of joint initial states
guarantees CP reduced dynamics, if and only if the sys-
tem privately owns all quantum degrees of freedom and
can locally access the classical degrees of freedom, with-
out disturbing all joint initial states in the given subset.
Moreover, we show that the correlations play a role in
the CP reduced dynamics from a structural perspective:
the quantum mutual information must be independent of
the quantum degrees of freedom.
Let Hs and He be the Hilbert spaces of the system
and its environment respectively, which are assumed to
be ﬁnite-dimensional throughout this work. The entirety
as a closed dynamical system experiences a joint unitary
evolution as ρse (cid:55)→ U ρseU†, where U is a unitary operator
acting on Hs ⊗ He. The reduced dynamical maps are
deﬁned as the transformation of the reduced states of
the system, namely,

Υ : ρs (cid:55)→ Tre(U ρseU†),

(1)

where ρs = Tre(ρse) is the reduced density operator fr the
open quantum system, and Tre denotes the partial trace
with respect to the environment. To make Υ well-deﬁned
by Eq. (1) for any unitary transformation U , the joint ini-
tial states ρse must be restricted in a subset, known as
the initial condition, such that each ρs corresponds to a
single ρse. Otherwise, for some unitary transformations
there will be two diﬀerent ﬁnal reduced states that corre-
spond to a single reduced initial state [8, 24, 25]. In other
words, the partial trace Tre must be a one-to-one map,
when restricted to the subset of joint initial states. The
reduced dynamical map can be generalized by identify-
ing a diﬀerent system-environment partition at the ﬁnal

time [23], namely,

Υ[s → s(cid:48)] : ρs → Tre(cid:48)(U ρseU†),

(2)

where s(cid:48) and e(cid:48) constitute another system-environment
partition such that Hs ⊗ He = Hs(cid:48) ⊗ He(cid:48).
Let B(H) be the space of all bounded linear operators
on a Hilbert space H. A linear map Φ from B(H1) to
B(H2) is called a CP map, if idn ⊗Φ maps all positive
semideﬁnite operator in B(Cn ⊗ H1) to positive semidef-
inite operators in B(Cn ⊗ H2) for any positive integer n,
where idn denote the identity maps from B(Cn) to B(Cn).
We say that a reduced dynamical map Υ admits a CP de-
scription, if there exists a CP extension of Υ to all density
operators of the system, that is, there exists a CP map
Φ such that Υ(ρs) = Φ(ρs) for all ρs in the domain of Υ.
Furthermore, we say that a subset of joint initial states
guarantees CP reduced dynamics, if any generalized re-
duced dynamical map Υ[s → s(cid:48)] (for any joint unitary
transformation and any system-environment partition at
the ﬁnal time) admits a CP description. Characterizing
the structure of the subsets of joint initial states that
guarantee CP reduced dynamics is the main purpose of
this work.

The CP description of reduced dynamics, if exists, is in
general dependent on the common characteristics shared
by the joint initial states, and independent of the indi-
vidual characteristics carried by the joint initial states in
the given subset. For instance, in the canonical case of
product initial states, the Kraus operators of the reduced
dynamical map depend on the ﬁxed state of the envi-
ronment. Similarly, for a set of correlated initial states,
the information concerning the common characteristics
of joint initial states can be incorporated into the de-
scription of the reduced dynamical map. The KI decom-
position [26] is such a method that separates the common
characteristics and the individual characteristics of states
in a given subset, and thus will be used for this problem.
The KI decomposition is restated by Hayden et al. [27]
as follows. For a set D of ﬁnite-dimensional density oper-
ators, there exists a unique decomposition of the Hilbert
space as

H =

Hlj ⊗ Hrj

(3)

such that the following two conditions are satisﬁed. (i)
Every density operator ρ in D can be expressed as

FIG. 1. Commutative diagram of the relevant maps between
quantum states.

B(Hlj ), and Φrj are quantum operations—CP and trace-
preserving linear maps—satisfying Φrj (˜ωrj ) = ˜ωrj for all
j. The tilde notation, ˜•, on a density operator means that
we are considering a ﬁxed density operator, henceforth.
By the KI decomposition, the degrees of the freedom
of states in a given subset are classiﬁed into three parts
in terms of Eq. (4), see Ref. [26]: The classical part {pj}
can be accessed by the projective measurement, whose el-
ements are the projections onto the subspace Hlj ⊗ Hrj ,
without disturbing all states in the given subset. The
quantum part {ρj} are inaccessible by the quantum op-
erations that do not disturb all states in the given subset.
The knowledge about the Hilbert space decomposition
Eq. (3) and the redundant part {˜ωj} are the same for all
states in the given subset, thus can be incorporated into
the CP description of reduced dynamical maps.

In order to bridge the complete positivity of reduced
dynamical maps and the KI decompositions, we resort
to the assignment maps [8], which assigns each reduced
initial state in the domain to a joint initial state. See
Fig. 1 for the relationships between the relevant maps.
Note that an assignment map Λ can be in principle de-
ﬁned on the domain as the inverse of Tre, as the joint
initial states ρse must be restricted in a subset such that
each ρs corresponds to a single ρse, in order to make the
reduced dynamical maps given by Eq. (1) well-deﬁned
for any joint unitary transformation U . The general-
ized reduced dynamical maps can then be expressed as
Υ[s → s(cid:48)] : ρs (cid:55)→ Tre(cid:48)(U Λ(ρs)U†).

Now, we give our main result by the following propo-

sition.
Proposition 1. For a given subset Dse of joint initial
states, the following statements are equivalent.

(a) Any generalized reduced dynamical map admits a

ρ =

pjρlj ⊗ ˜ωrj .

(4)

CP description.

(ii) Every quantum operation Φ that leaves all ρ in D
invariant satisﬁes
B(Hlj ⊗Hrj ) = idlj ⊗Φrj ,
Φ|

(5)
where {pj} is a probability distribution, ˜ωrj are ﬁxed
density operators on Hrj , idlj are the identity maps on

(b) There exists a CP assignment map, in the sense
that the assignment map Λ deﬁned on the subset of
reduced initial states admits a CP extension to all
density operators.

(c) There exists a decomposition Hs = (cid:76)

j Hlj ⊗ Hrj

for the system Hilbert space such that every state

ρseUρseU†ρsTre0(UρU†)UTreTre0Υ[s→s0]Λin Dse can be expressed as

(cid:77)

ρse =

pjρlj ⊗ ˜ωrj e,

(6)

j

where {pj} is a probability distribution, ρlj are den-
sity operators on Hlj , and ˜ωrj e are ﬁxed density
operators on Hrj ⊗ He.

Proof. The fact that (a) implies (b) can be seen by noting
that the generalized reduced dynamical map with U =
11s ⊗ 11e and Hs(cid:48) = Hs ⊗ He itself is an assignment map,
where 11s and 11e are the identity operators on Hs and
He respectively.

We now prove that (b) implies (c). Let Λ be a CP
(cid:76)
assignment map satisfying Tre[Λ(ρs)] = ρs for all ρs
in the domain Ds := {Tre ρse|ρse ∈ Dse}. Let Hs =
j Hlj ⊗ Hrj be the KI decomposition of the system
Hilbert space for Ds. Since the composite map Tre ◦Λ
leaves all density operators in Ds invariant, it must sat-
isfy Eq. (5) with Φ = Tre ◦Λ, that is,

Tre ◦Λ|

B(Hlj ⊗Hrj ) = idlj ⊗ Tre ◦Λrj

(7)
with Λrj being a CP map from B(Hrj ) to B(Hrj ⊗ He)
(cid:76)
such that Tre ◦Λrj (˜ωrj ) = ˜ωrj . Thus, ρse = Λ(ρs) =
j pjρlj ⊗ ˜ωrj e with ˜ωrj e = Λrj (˜ωrj ), which is in the

form of Eq. (6).

To prove that (c) implies (a), we explicitly construct a
CP assignment map for the states of the form Eq. (6) as
follows:

Λ(ρs) =

Trrj (ΠjρsΠj) ⊗ ˜ωrj e,

(8)

j

where Πj are the projections from Hs onto the subspace
Hli ⊗Hrj . Note that the unitary channel and the partial
trace are both CP, and the compositions of CP maps are
also CP. Therefore, any generalized reduced dynamical
map, Υ[s → s(cid:48)] : ρs (cid:55)→ Tre(cid:48)(U Λ(ρs)U†), is CP.

(cid:88)

We shall show how our result are related to the pre-
vious ones. First, if we require the reduced initial states
to contain all density operators on the system Hilbert
space, then the KI decomposition of the reduced initial
states can only have a single subspace and Hl1 = Hs.
In other words, the joint initial states must be product
states with a ﬁxed environmental state, which recovers
Pechukas’s result [8]. Second, Liu and Tong [22] showed
that the CP reduced dynamics is guaranteed if the joint
initial states are in the subsets of the form

 n(cid:77)

where the system Hilbert space is decomposed into Hs =
j=1 Hs,j, {pj} is an arbitrary probability distribution,

j=n+1

3
ρs,j are arbitrary density operators on Hs,j, ˜ωse,j are
ﬁxed density operator on Hs,j ⊗ He, and ˜ωe,j are ﬁxed
operators on He. This form includes as special cases
the previous examples of the subset of joint initial states
with vanishing quantum discord [19] as well as with non-
vanishing quantum discord [21]. It is easy to see that the
states given in Eq. (6) are in the form of Eq. (6) with Hlj
being either 1-dimensional or of the same dimension as
Hs,j.

Third, Buscemi considered a typical kind of joint initial
states that are generated from a ﬁxed ancillary-system-
environment tripartite state by post-selecting in the an-
cillary, that is,

(cid:26) Tra[(Ea ⊗ 11s ⊗ 11e)˜ρase]

Tr[(Ea ⊗ 11s ⊗ 11e)˜ρase]

Dse =

| 0 ≤ Ea ≤ 11a

(10)

(cid:27)

(cid:77)

with 11a being the identity operator on the ancillary
Hilbert space [23]. It was shown that a post-selected fam-
ily of joint initial states guarantee CP reduced dynamics,
if and only if the tripartite state ˜ρase is an ancillary-
system-environment short quantum Markov chain [23].
Note that a short quantum Markov chain ˜ρase can be
expressed as

˜pj ˜ρalj ⊗ ˜ρrj e

(11)

˜ρase =

j

with the decomposition Hs =(cid:76)

j Hlj ⊗ Hrj for the sys-
tem Hilbert space, where {˜pj} is a probability distribu-
tion, ˜ρalj and ˜ρrj e are density operators on Ha ⊗ Hlj
and Hrj ⊗ He respectively (see Theorem 6 in Ref. [27]).
Then, it is easy to see that the post-selected family from
a tripartite short quantum Markov chain are in the form
of Eq. (6).

In fact, the post-selected families used in Ref. [23] are
suﬃciently general such that a family of joint states in
the form of Eq. (6) can always be generated as a post-
selected family, Eq. (10), with a tripartite short quantum
Markov chain [28]

˜ρase =

|j(cid:105)(cid:104)j|a1 ⊗ φa2,lj ⊗ ˜ωrj e,

(12)

j

k,l=1

Ha1 ⊗Ha2 , and φa2,lj =(cid:80)dim Hlj

where the ancillary is associated with the Hilbert space
|k(cid:105)(cid:104)l|⊗|k(cid:105)(cid:104)l|/(dimHlj )
are maximally entangled states deﬁned on Ha2 ⊗ Hlj for
all j. Note that the dimension of Ha2 should be not
less than the maximal dimension of Hlj for all j. Thus,
any subset of joint initial states that guarantee the CP
reduced dynamics can be generated as a subset of a post-
selected family from a speciﬁc tripartite short quantum
Markov chain.

From the perspective of the classiﬁcation of degrees of
freedom by the KI decomposition, Proposition 1 means
that a subset of joint initial states guarantees CP reduced
dynamics, if and only if all quantum degrees of freedom

(cid:88)

are privately owned by the system, and the classical de-
grees of freedom can be locally accessed by the system
without disturbance. Here, the local accessibility of the
classical degrees of freedom without disturbance means
that there exists a local measurement, performed only on
the system, such that the classical probability distribu-
tion can be produced without disturbing all joint initial
states in the given subset. To be precise, such a local
measurement is the projective measurement with respect
to the projections from Hs onto Hlj ⊗ Hrj . The equiva-
lence between the families given by Eq. (6) and Eq. (10)
is also proved in Ref. [liu]

It is of interest whether correlation between the sys-
tem and its environment plays an essential role in the
complete positivity of the reduced dynamics restricted
to a given subset of joint initial states. It was pointed
out in Ref. [21, 22] that there is no deﬁnite relation be-
tween correlations in the individual states and the com-
plete positivity of the reduced dynamics; this also can
be seen by noting that the redundant part, the ﬁxed
density operators {˜ωrj e} in Eq. (6), may in principle
possess any kind of correlation. Here, we show that
there is indeed a relation between the CP reduced dy-
namics and the classicality of the correlation in another
sense: the quantum mutual information of the joint ini-
tial states that guarantee CP reduced dynamics is inde-
pendent of the quantum degrees of freedom. This can
be seen by substituting Eq. (6) into the quantum mu-
tual information I(ρse) = S(ρs) + S(ρe) − S(ρse), where
S(ρ) = − Tr(ρ ln ρ) being the von Neumann entropy. It
follows after some algebras that

(cid:88)

(cid:0)S(˜ωrj ) − S(˜ωrj e)(cid:1) ,

I(ρse) = S(ρe) +

pj

(13)

j

where ˜ωrj

(cid:80)
used S(⊕jpjρj) = −(cid:80)

:= Tre(˜ωrj e) and ρe

:= Trs ρse =
j pj Trrj ˜ωrj e. In the derivation of Eq. (13), we have
j pjS(ρj) and S(ρ ⊗

j pj ln pj +(cid:80)

σ) = S(ρ) + S(σ).

We here give the Kraus operators of the CP reduced
dynamical maps for a subset of joint initial states given
by Eq. (6) and a given joint unitary operator U . For sim-
plicity, it is enough to consider the union of the supports
of all reduced initial states, and from now on we will as-
sume that this reduction of the system Hilbert space has
been done. As a consequence, ˜ωrj , deﬁned as Tre ˜ωrj e,
have full ranks on the Hilbert space Hrj . Then, gen-
eralized reduced dynamical maps can be expressed as
αβ KαβρsK†αβ with the Kraus opera-
tors from Hs to Hs(cid:48) being deﬁned by Kαβ = (cid:104)αe(cid:48)|U A|βe(cid:105),
is an operator on Hs ⊗ He,
and {|αe(cid:48)(cid:105)} and {|βe(cid:105)} are bases of He(cid:48) and He respec-
tively. It is easy to convince oneself that Kαβ is a set of

Υ[s → s(cid:48)](ρs) =(cid:80)

In summary, we have investigated the complete posi-
tivity of the reduced dynamics, from the structural per-
spective of considering the degrees of freedom of joint
initial states in a given subset.
