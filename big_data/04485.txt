Abstract

We revisit the subject of holographic renormalization for asymptotically AdS spacetimes.
For many applications of holography, one has to handle the divergences associated with the
on-shell gravitational action. The brute force approach uses the Feﬀerman-Graham (FG) ex-
pansion near the AdS boundary to identify the divergences, but subsequent reversal of the
expansion is needed to construct the inﬁnite counterterms. While in principle straightforward,
the method is cumbersome and application/reversal of FG is formally unsatisfactory. Various
authors have proposed an alternative method based on the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. How-
ever, this approach may appear to be abstract, diﬃcult to implement, and in some cases limited
in applicability. In this paper, we clarify the Hamilton-Jacobi formulation of holographic renor-
malization and present a simple algorithm for its implementation to extract cleanly the inﬁnite
counterterms. While the derivation of the method relies on the Hamiltonian formulation of
general relativity, the actual application of our algorithm does not. The work applies to any
D-dimensional holographic dual with asymptotic AdS boundary, Euclidean or Lorentzian, and
arbitrary slicing. We illustrate the method in several examples, including the FGPW model, a
holographic model of 3d ABJM theory, and cases with marginal scalars such as a dilaton-axion
system.

Introduction

In many applications of gauge-gravity duality, there is a need to regulate divergences that appear
near the boundary of the bulk theory; these are simply associated with UV divergences in the
dual quantum ﬁeld theory. The divergences appear, for example, in calculations of conformal
anomalies, correlation functions, and the free energy. The prescription for regulating divergences
is to include suitable local counterterms. The resulting process of holographic renormalization
it was discussed in the early days of AdS/CFT [1] and implemented in the
is an old subject:
classic calculations of conformal anomalies [2], the trace of the stress-tensor [3], and since then in
countless other examples.

We focus on bulk spacetimes that are asymptotically AdS or Euclidean AdS. This includes
duals of conformal theories (CFTs) as well as holographic renormalization group ﬂows with a UV
CFT. For a given gravity dual, the local counterterms are universal and one can calculate them
once and for all in any given gravitational model. We distinguish between inﬁnite counterterms and
ﬁnite counterterms. The former are unambiguous and can be determined using the bulk equations
of motion. The ﬁnite counterterms, however, can typically only be ﬁxed using further constraints,
such as supersymmetry. In this paper, we are concerned only with the inﬁnite counterterms.

There is a standard ‘brute force’ procedure for determining the inﬁnite counterterms [2, 3, 4, 5].
One expands the metric and ﬁelds near the AdS boundary using the Feﬀerman-Graham (FG)
expansion [6]. Solving the equations of motion relates various coeﬃcients in the FG expansion,
but leaves unﬁxed the coeﬃcients that correspond to the source and vev rates for each ﬁeld. Using
a suitable cutoﬀ, the on-shell action is evaluated near the AdS boundary by plugging in the FG
expansion, subject to the equations of motion. This identiﬁes the divergences, however, they will
be expressed in terms of the free coeﬃcients in the FG expansion. This is not suﬃcient, as local
counterterms must be expressed directly in terms of the ﬁelds on the cutoﬀ surface. So starting
with the most divergent terms, one works systematically backwards to convert each divergence
to a local ﬁeld expression, thus basically reversing the FG expansion. This process identiﬁes the
ﬁeld polynomials that are responsible for the divergences in the on-shell action. The counterterm
action is then taken to be exactly minus those ﬁeld expressions; this ensures that the renormalized
action Sbulk + Sct is ﬁnite. (This still leaves the possibility of ambiguities from ﬁnite counterterms;
we will discuss this brieﬂy in the Discussion section.)

While straightforward for many simple models with just one or two scalar ﬁelds, the brute force
approach outlined above becomes increasingly tedious for models with multiple ﬁelds. Moreover,
it is fundamentally unsatisfying that one ﬁrst abandons the ﬁeld expressions in favor of Feﬀerman-
Graham only to reverse back to ﬁelds after identifying the inﬁnite terms. For this reason, another
approach, based on the Hamiltonian formalism for gravity and the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, has
been proposed for holographic renormalization.

Early in the studies of holographic renormalization group ﬂows, de Boer, Verlinde, and Ver-
linde [7] proposed to use the Hamilton-Jacobi equation to derive ﬁrst-order equations for the
supergravity model and they related it to the Callan-Symanzik equation. The speciﬁc application
of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation to determine inﬁnite counterterms was studied by Papadimitriou
and Skenderis in [8] (see also [9, 10, 11]). One limitation of the method in [8] is that the dilatation
operator is used to organize the calculation. This requires that the ﬁelds are eigenfunctions of the
dilatation operator, but that fails for scalars dual to operators with scaling dimension ∆ = d/2,
because of its leading log-falloﬀ. This is not an exotic case, but a very common one; for example,
in a d = 4 ﬁeld theory, a scalar mass term is a relevant operator of dimension ∆ = 2. Another

2

challenge is that, as presented in [8], the Hamilton-Jacobi method looks rather diﬃcult to carry
out in practice.

The goal of this paper is to straighten out and simplify the approach of [8]. We will show
that the application of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation can be implemented via an algorithm that
signiﬁcantly simpliﬁes the process of computing the inﬁnite counterterms. To avoid the issue of the
dilatation operator and have an approach that applies more generally, we organize the calculation
in terms a derivative expansion, as also suggested in for example [7] and [11].

We will be working with bulk actions of the form

S = −

1

2κ2 ZM

dd+1x√g(cid:16)R[g] − gµν GIJ ∂µΦI∂ν ΦJ − V (Φ)(cid:17) ,

(1.1)

where we allow for a general metric GIJ = GIJ (Φ) on the scalar manifold. We will consider
domain wall solutions with arbitrary slicing and assume that the asymptotic UV structure of the
metric is AdS (or Euclidean AdS). For such a system, we formulate the Hamilton-Jacobi problem
for the on-shell action Son-shell; this is basically a partial diﬀerential equation for Son-shell and
once derived, one no longer has to think about the Hamiltonian formulation of general relativity.
Instead, one systematically solves the Hamilton-Jacobi diﬀerential equation for Son-shell by writing
a suitable Ansatz for its divergent terms and then solving for the coeﬃcients in this Ansatz. (A
similar approach was taken in the context of dS space in [12].) The key point here is that scalars
dual to relevant operators in the ﬁeld theory go to zero at the boundary. Therefore there can only
be limited powers of each ﬁeld in the inﬁnite counterterms, and that makes the Ansatz ﬁnite.

We illustrate the use of the method in several contexts. To start out, we reproduce the purely
gravitational counterterms [4] in d-dimensions. To show how the method works for a case with d
odd, we reproduce the inﬁnite counterterms of the d = 3 ABJM dual model of [13]. We then turn
to the example of the d = 4 FGPW model [14] whose two scalars have ∆ = 2 and ∆ = 3.

In the presence of a marginal scalar, more care must be taken. A marginal scalar generically
goes to a ﬁnite value at the boundary and therefore the associated counterterms do not enjoy
the same suppression as the scalars dual to relevant operators. We handle this by allowing the
coeﬃcients of our Ansatz for Son-shell to be functions of the marginal scalar. We have applied
this method successfully to calculate the counterterms for a ten-scalar model dual to (a limit of)
N = 1∗ theory on S4 [15]; this indeed served as a motivation for us to revisit the subject of
holographic renormalization. However, for the purpose of presentation here, we restrict ourselves
to simply show how our method reproduce the inﬁnite counterterms for the dilaton-axion system
in [11].

The paper is organized as follows.

In Section 2, we present the Hamilton-Jacobi equation
for the bulk and describe our algorithm for determining the inﬁnite counterterms. Section 3
implements the method for pure gravity in d dimensions. The examples of the ABJM model
and FGPW can be found in Sections 4 and 5; these give very concrete illustrations of how we
implement the algorithm. The more advanced case of marginal scalars is treated in Section 6. The
three appendices contain various technical details. Appendix A is a short list of useful identities
for the metric variations of gravitational curvatures. Appendix B gives details of the calculation
of the gravitational six-derivative terms needed for counterterms in d = 6. Finally, Appendix
C oﬀers explicit calculation of the one-point functions in FGPW to illustrate that the one-point
functions determined from the renormalized action with our inﬁnite counterterms are indeed all
ﬁnite.

2 Hamiltonian Approach to Holographic Renormalization

We start with a brief description of the essential parts of the Hamiltonian formulation needed
for holographic renormalization. We then formulate of the problem of determining the on-shell
action in terms of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation and we present our algorithm for calculating the
divergent part of the on-shell action.

2.1 Hamiltonian formalism of gravity

We consider a general form of the bulk gravitational action:

S = −

1

2κ2 ZM

dd+1x √g(cid:0)R[g] − gµν GIJ ∂µΦI∂ν ΦJ − V (Φ)(cid:1) −

ddx √γK .

(2.1)

1

κ2 Z∂M

The last term in (2.1) is the Gibbons-Hawking boundary term which ensures that the variational
problem is well-deﬁned.
In this term, γij is the induced metric on the boundary and K is its
extrinsic curvature.

We choose a gauge for the bulk metric gµν such that the line element takes the form

ds2 = dr2 + γij(r, x)dxidxj ,

(2.2)

where latin indices i, j, . . . are in the range i, j = 1, 2, . . . , d and will denote boundary coordinates.

This allows us to decompose the Ricci scalar in the action to get

S = −

1

2κ2 ZM

ddx dr√γ(cid:16)R[γ] + K 2 − KijK ij − GIJ ˙ΦI ˙ΦJ − γijGIJ ∂iΦI∂jΦJ − V (Φ)(cid:17) ,

(2.3)

where the extrinsic curvatures are

K i

j =

1
2

γik ˙γkj

and

K =

1
2

γij ˙γij .

(2.4)

The dots denote derivatives with respect to r. The boundary Gibbons-Hawking term does not
appear in the expression (2.3), since it has been canceled by boundary terms that occur from
partial integration of second derivative terms in the expansion of R[g].

In the Hamiltonian formulation of holographic renormalization, the radial coordinate r plays

the role of the time coordinate. Therefore, the conjugate momenta to the ﬁelds are given by

πij =

δS
δ ˙γij

=

and the Hamiltonian is

1

2κ2√γ(cid:0)K ij − Kγij(cid:1)

and

πI =

δS
δ ˙ΦI

=

1

κ2√γGIJ ˙ΦJ ,

(2.5)

H =Z∂M

ddx(cid:16)πij ˙γij + πI ˙ΦI − L(cid:17)

=

1

2κ2 Z∂M

ddx√γ(cid:0)R[γ] − K 2 + KijK ij + GIJ pI pJ − γijGIJ ∂iΦI ∂jΦJ − V (Φ)(cid:1) ,

where, for simplicity, we have introduced pI ≡ κ2

√γ πI.

(2.6)

4

2.2 Hamilton-Jacobi formulation

The Hamilton-Jacobi formulation is well-known in classical mechanics [16]. With the radial coor-
dinate r playing the role of time, the Hamilton-Jacobi equation takes the form

H +

∂Son-shell

∂r

= 0 .

(2.7)

Just as in classical mechanics, it is key to emphasize that in the Hamilton-Jacobian formalism,
the Hamiltonian is a functional of canonical momenta deﬁned by

πij =

δSon-shell

δγij

and

pI =

κ2
√γ

πI =

κ2
√γ

δSon-shell

δΦI

,

(2.8)

as opposed to the canonical deﬁnitions (2.5). When the momenta are deﬁned via equation (2.5)
with the extrinsic curvature given by (2.4), the Hamiltonian constraint of Einstein’s equation is
simply H = 0. If this were used with the Hamilton-Jacobi equation (2.7), it would imply that
the action has no explicit r-dependence; this is of course true for the diﬀeomorphism-invariant
gravitational bulk action whose metric equations-of-motion imply the Hamiltonian constraint.
However, it is not true for the on-shell action, which is a boundary action; it has explicit r-
dependence, as we shall see, and to determine it via the Hamilton-Jacobi equation we must use
the deﬁnitions (2.8). With (2.8), the Hamilton-Jacobi equation (2.7) should be thought of as a
ﬁrst-order partial diﬀerential equation for Son-shell with respect to the ﬁelds, the metric, and r.

A practical approach is to use an Ansatz for the on-shell action: below we will be more explicit
about how we choose an appropriate Ansatz, but for now we will develop the general formalism
further. Let us write the Ansatz as

Son-shell =

1

κ2 Z∂Mǫ

ddx√γ U (γ, Φ, r) .

(2.9)

The function U is a function of the induced (inverse) metric γij on the boundary and the scalar
ﬁelds ΦI, and it has also explicit dependence on r. The cutoﬀ surface ∂Mǫ becomes the boundary
of the spacetime when ǫ → 0.

Using the above Ansatz, the Hamilton-Jacobi equation takes the form

R[γ] + KijK ij − K 2 + GIJ pI pJ − γijGIJ ∂iΦI∂jΦJ − V (Φ) + 2

∂U
∂r

= 0 .

(2.10)

We emphasize that this equation is to be understood as an integral equation, i.e. it holds up to
total derivatives and we can manipulate it using partial integration in the boundary coordinates.
As discussed above, the conjugate momenta in (2.10) will be given by derivatives of U . For

the scalar ﬁeld conjugates, this straightforwardly gives

pI =

κ2
√γ

δSon-shell

δΦI

⇒ pI =

δU
δΦI

(2.11)

The conjugate momentum of the metric enters (2.10) via the extrinsic curvatures, since K ij =
2κ2

d−1 γijπklγkl(cid:1), as follows from (2.5). Now in the context of the Hamilton-Jacobi for-

malism, the extrinsic curvatures K ij in (2.10) must then be expressed in terms of πij as given by
(2.8). This gives

√γ(cid:0)πij − 1

j = −2γik δU
K i

δγkj −

1

d − 1(cid:18)U − 2γmn δU

δγmn(cid:19) δi

(2.12)

where we have used γijγjk = δk
i
derivatives with respect to the inverse metric rather than the metric; this will be useful later.

=⇒ (δγij )γjk = −γij(δγjk) to express K i

in terms of

j

It is convenient to deﬁne

Yij =

δU
δγij

and

Y = γijYij .

(2.13)

One then ﬁnds from (2.12) that the dependence on extrinsic curvatures in the Hamilton-Jacobi
equation (2.10) is given in terms of U as

K ≡ KijK ij − K 2 = 4YijY ij −

1

d − 1

(U − 2Y )2 − U 2 .

(2.14)

To summarize, our strategy for computing the on-shell action Son-shell is to use the Ansatz

(2.9) and solve the Hamilton-Jacobi equation

R[γ] + K + GIJ pI pJ − γijGIJ ∂iΦI ∂jΦJ − V (Φ) + 2

∂U
∂r

= 0 .

(2.15)

with conjugate momenta given by (2.11) and K deﬁned in (2.14). We remind the reader that
equation (2.15) has to hold only as an integral equation, so we are free to manipulate it using
partial integration. While this was derived using the Hamiltonian formalism of gravity, we no
longer need to think of the problem that way. Rather, we now have diﬀerential equation (2.15)
for the on-shell action Son-shell. Next, we explain how to solve it systematically.

2.3 Algorithm to determine the divergent part of the on-shell action

Let us next address how we propose to use the Hamilton-Jacobi formulation to determine the
divergent part of the on-shell action and thereby the counterterms needed for a ﬁnite result. We
outline here the general approach, however the method is much better illustrated by concrete
examples; these follow in the next sections.

We assume that asymptotically the bulk metric approaches AdS space: in terms of the choice

of coordinates (2.2), ds2 = dr2 + γij(r, x)dxidxj, this means that

γij → e2r/L γ(0)ij + . . .

as

r → ∞ ,

(2.16)

where L is the AdS radius. The boundary metric γ(0)ij can be Lorentzian or Euclidean, it can be
ﬂat or curved. For example, recent applications of holography considered the dual ﬁeld theory on
a d-dimensional compact Euclidean spaces, such as spheres. In the following, γ(0)ij will be general.

The asymptotic behavior (2.16), gives √γ ∼ edr√γ(0). We are focusing only on the divergent
parts of the on-shell action, so we need terms in U only up to orders e−dr (possibly including
also terms polynomial in r). Since the inverse metric γij scales as e−2r, we can ignore any terms

with more than (cid:4) d

2(cid:5) inverse metrics. Any (boundary) derivatives that appear in terms in U must

necessarily be contracted pairwise by inverse metrics γij, so we do not consider terms with more
than d-derivatives. All in all, this makes it natural to organize the Ansatz for U in a derivative
expansion:

where the subscript represents the number of derivatives in each term. Curvature terms such as
the boundary Ricci scalar, Ricci tensor, and Riemann tensor are each order 2 (i.e. they have two

U = U(0) + U(2) + . . . + U(2⌊ d

2⌋) ,

(2.17)

6

derivatives). Previous work, for example [7] and [11], have also organized the on-shell action as a
derivative expansion.

For the 0th order in the derivative expansion, we have Y(0)ij =

δU(0)
δγij = 0, so (2.14) simply gives

Thus at 0th order, the Hamilton-Jacobian equation (2.10) becomes

K(0) = −

V (Φ) = GIJ δU(0)

δΦJ −

U 2

(0) + 2

∂U(0)

∂r

.

d
d − 1

(2.18)

(2.19)

Without the last r-derivative term, we see that U(0) is essentially like a (fake) superpotential for
the scalar potential V ; this was also noted [7] (see also [17, 11]). In general, it is not easy to solve
for a superpotential for a given V ; however, we will not need to since our focus is on the generic
asymptotically divergent terms only. As noted in the discussion below (2.8) the presence of the
explicit r-derivative term in the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, and hence in (2.19), is crucial — this
point does not seem to have been appreciated in previous discussions of the method.

Let us for later convenience also record the results for K at two- and four-derivative order:
K(2) = −
d − 1
K(4) = 4Y(2)ij Y ij

U(0)(cid:2)U(2) − 2Y(2)(cid:3) − 2U(0)U(2) ,
d − 1(cid:2)U(2) − 2Y(2)(cid:3)2 −
(2) −
d − 1

U(0)(cid:2)U(4) − 2Y(4)(cid:3) − U 2

(2) − 2U(0)U(4) ,

1

2

(2.20)

2

where Y(k)ij =

δU(k)
δγij .

We propose the following algorithm to determine the inﬁnite terms in the on-shell action:

Step 1: Ansatz for U(2n). For each U(2n), we write a systematic Ansatz that includes all
potentially divergent terms of this order with undetermined coeﬃcients,1 for example

U(0) = A0 + A1φ + A3φ2 + . . .

and U(2) = B0R + B1Rφ + B2φ(cid:3)φ + . . .

(2.21)

where the coeﬃcients Ai and Bi can have explicit dependence on r. The Hamilton-Jacobi equations
will therefore give us diﬀerential equations of these coeﬃcients which we solve asymptotically,
keeping only terms that give divergent contributions to the on-shell action.

I is ΦI → ΦI

Recall that the asymptotic behavior of a scalar with bulk mass m2

(0)e−(d−∆I )r/L,
where m2
I L2 = ∆I (∆I − d). The two solutions for ∆I correspond to the source and vev-rate
falloﬀs. When a scalar approaches zero at the boundary, as is the case in many applications, we
can immediately read oﬀ how many powers of the scalar can possibly appear in U(2n); the number
of possible terms is ﬁnite and limited by the fact that we are only interested in the divergent
terms.2 For example, if φ is a scalar with dimension ∆φ = 3 in d = 4, then φ ∼ e−r, and we
have to include powers up to φ4 in U(0) and φ(cid:3)φ can appear in U(2). (Note: such terms with e−dr
falloﬀ will be ﬁnite unless the r-dependence in the coeﬃcient makes it divergent.) On the other
hand, if φ in (2.21) is a ∆φ = 2 scalar in d = 4, there can at most be quadratic powers of φ in
U(0) and the term φ(cid:3)φ is not divergent, so it not included in the Ansatz for U(2).

1Terms are considered equivalent if related by partial integration.
2We will also discuss cases with a marginal scalar m2

I = 0, for which there is no suppression near the boundary
and generically the scalar goes to a non-zero constant. For such cases, we allow the coeﬃcients Ai in our Ansatz to
be functions of the marginal scalar. An example is presented in Section 6.

7

One can impose symmetries of the theory in order to further simplify the Ansatz for U(2n).
If, for example, the bulk action has a symmetry φ → −φ, we can drop any terms odd under this
symmetry in the Ansatz.

Step 2: Conjugate momenta. Next, using the leading asymptotic behaviors of the ﬁelds, we
determine the leading asymptotics of the conjugate momenta. Using this together with pI = δU
δΦI
ﬁxes some of the coeﬃcients in U(0) quite easily.

Step 3: Solving the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. We plug the Ansatz for U(2n) into the
Hamilton-Jacobi equation and we solve it order by order by demanding that the coeﬃcients of
the diﬀerent ﬁeld monomials vanish independently. When necessary, use partial integration to
eliminate potentially non-independent terms that appeared by varying U . We start with U(0),
then use those results to determine U(2), then U(4) etc.

Step 4: Counterterm action. Once the divergent terms in Son-shell have been determined,
the counterterm action is simply

This is added to the bulk action to get the regularized action Sreg = Sbulk + SGH + Sct from which
correlation functions can be computed and by construction are guaranteed to be ﬁnite. In many
cases, counterterm actions are presented in term of the Feﬀerman-Graham radial coordinate ρ
related to r via ρ = e−2r/L, so that the line element is

Sct = −Son-shell(cid:12)(cid:12)div .

(2.22)

ds2 = L2 dρ2

ρ2 + γij dxidxj .

(2.23)

We determine the divergent terms in on-shell action using the r-coordinate, but convert to ρ-
coordinates for the ﬁnal presentation of our counterterm actions. In terms of the ρ-coordinate,
the cutoﬀ surface ∂Mǫ, introduced in (2.9), is then located at ρ = ǫ.

In the following sections, we demonstrate the procedure explicitly in a set of representative
explicit examples. We start with pure gravity in d-dimensions with d = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, then move
on to a d = 3 ABJM dual model and the d = 4 two-scalar model known as FGPW. Finally, we
illustrate how our method works with marginal scalars (dilaton + axion in d = 4).

3 Pure Gravity

The simplest model one can consider is pure AdS gravity with no matter content in D = d + 1
dimensions. Counterterms obtained by renormalizing this model will be present in every other
model and it is therefore useful to deal with them once and for all. The action we consider is
given by (2.1) with no scalar ﬁelds and constant scalar potential

The Hamilton-Jacobi equation (2.15) simpliﬁes to

(3.2)

with K given by (2.14). Let us now apply the algorithmic procedure described in the previous
section in order to determine the necessary counterterms for this class of theories.

Step 1: Since there are no scalars, the general Ansatz for each order of the expansion of U is

U(0) = A(r) ,

U(2) = B(r)R ,

U(4) = C1(r)RijRij + C2(r)R2 ,

(3.3)

where the four-derivative terms are only needed for d ≥ 4.3 We are not including terms like (cid:3)R
since it is a total derivative and it will not contribute in the on-shell action. For d ≥ 6, we need
(3.4)

k + D4RijRklRikjl + D5R(cid:3)R + D6Rij (cid:3)Rij .

U(6) = D1R3 + D2RRijRij + D3R j

i R k

j R i

This is not a complete list of independent six-derivative terms, but it turns out to be a suﬃcient
list.

It is important that all the coeﬃcients in the above expressions for U depend on the radial

coordinate r, as this will capture the explicit r-dependence of the on-shell action.

Step 2: This step is irrelevant for the pure gravity case since there are no matter ﬁelds.

Step 3: We now solve Hamilton-Jacobi equation (3.2) order by order to determine the unknown
coeﬃcients A, B, C1,2 and Di.

At zero-derivatives, (3.2) with K(0) given by (2.18) gives

The linear r behavior in the d = 2 case is our ﬁrst illustration of the explicit r-dependence in the
on-shell action and the importance of keeping the ∂Son-shell
-term in the Hamilton-Jacobi equation.
For the four-derivative terms, we calculate the inverse-metric variation of U4 using the formulas
in Appendix A. In particular, we ﬁnd Y(4) = 2C1RijRij + 2C2R2 (up to total derivatives that can
be dropped). Using this together with the results for Y(2) above, we can calculate K(4) given in
∂U(4)

These purely gravitational counterterms reproduce results well-known in the literature, see for
example [4], but it is relevant to present them here in the context of our approach to holographic
renormalization. In particular, they will appear in the following examples.

4 Renormalization for the ABJM model

ABJM theory [18] is the N = 6 superconformal Chern-Simons theory in d = 3 dimensions with
gauge group U (N ) × U (N ) and Chern-Simons levels k and −k. Its holographic dual is M-theory
on AdS4 × S7/Zk. In the limit of large t’Hooft coupling (λ = N/k), M-theory reduces to eleven
dimensional supergravity on AdS4× S7/Zk. The recent paper [13] by Freedman and Pufu explores
the gauge-gravity dual description of F -maximization for ABJM theory on a 3-sphere using a 4-
dimensional holographic dual. We will use the model of [13] as a very simple example to illustrate
our approach to holographic renormalization.

The ABJM holographic model [13] is described by the Euclidean bulk action

Sbulk = −

2κ2 ZM

where κ2 = 8πG4 and the matter Lagrangian is

1 − za ¯za(cid:19) .

(4.1)

(4.2)

In the Euclidean theory, the scalars za and ¯za are independent complex ﬁelds, not related by
complex conjugation. However, since only products of za and ¯za appear in this Lagrangian, it
is useful to deﬁne za → 1
(χa − iψa), where χa and ψa are ﬁelds that can
√2
take complex values.

(χa + iψa) , ¯za → 1

V =

(4.4)

so the six ﬁelds χa and ψa all have mass −2/L2. By our general discussion, this means that their
asymptotic falloﬀ is generically e−r/L.

For simplicity, let us start out with a model with just one pair of the ﬁelds χ and ψ; since the
ABJM dual has the three pairs appear the same way and they do not mix, it is easy to generalize
the result back to that case. Thus setting the ﬁelds with a = 2, 3 to zero, we will consider the
model described by the potential

where K is given by equation (2.14) and the conjugate momenta pχ and pψ are the χ and ψ
derivatives of the on-shell action (2.11). We now proceed to determine the inﬁnite counterterms
for this model.

Step 1: Since we are working in d = 3 dimensions we need to include in our Ansatz only terms
with up to two derivatives:

U = U(0) + U(2) .

(4.7)

Terms with four or more derivatives give ﬁnite contributions to the on-shell action.

Keeping only potentially divergent contributions means that for U(0) we only need to consider
terms up to cubic order in the scalar ﬁelds. However, we get strong constraints on the Ansatz
from the symmetries of the model: it is invariant under the transformations χ → −χ, ψ → −ψ,
and χ ↔ ψ. With these symmetries imposed, the most general Ansatz at zero-derivative order is
(4.8)

+ A(r)(χ2 + ψ2) .

U(0) = −

L

The constant term is ﬁxed from the purely gravitational calculation of Section 3. At two-derivative
order, the only potentially divergent term that preserves the symmetries of the theory is purely
gravitational and it was calculated in Section 3:

U(2) = −
We can skip Step 2 because the model is so simple.

This has solution

(4.13)

Since A was the only unknown coeﬃcient in the Ansatz for U , this concludes the calculation of
the inﬁnite contributions in the on-shell action. Speciﬁcally, we have found that

U(0) = −

This result is in perfect agreement with the counterterm action given in equations (6.4)-(6.5) in
[13]. For the applications in [13] one further needs to use supersymmetry to the determine the
ﬁnite counterterms; we do not discuss this here.

5 Renormalization for the FGPW model

The FGPW model [14] is the holographic dual of the single-mass limit of N = 1∗ gauge theory
in ﬂat space. This non-conformal ﬁeld theory is obtained from N = 4 SYM theory by softly
breaking the supersymmetry to N = 1 as follows. In N = 1 language, N = 4 SYM consists of
a vector multiplet and three chiral multiplets. The ﬁeld theory dual to FGPW is obtained by
giving a mass to one of the chiral multiplets. In the UV, the conformal theory of N = 4 SYM is
recovered, while in the infrared, the theory ﬂows to a Leigh-Strassler ﬁxed point. The holographic
dual FGPW model captures the RG ﬂow of the this theory via a ﬂat-space sliced domain wall
solution which approaches asymptotic AdS5 in the UV and another AdS5 in the IR. The ratio of
the AdS radii in the UV and IR translates to the ratio of UV and IR central charges a in the ﬁeld
theory. More generally, the authors of [19, 14] derived the ﬁrst version of a holographic version of
the c-theorem.

The holographic FGPW model is described by a D = 4 + 1-dimensional bulk action

(5.4)

The scalars ψ and φ are dimension ∆ψ = 3 and ∆φ = 2 ﬁelds dual to the fermion and scalar mass
deformations of N = 4 SYM. They approach zero near the UV boundary as

ψ ∼ ψ0 e−r/L

and

φ ∼ (φ0r + ˜φ0) e−2r/L ,

(5.5)

as r → ∞. For the purpose of holographic renormalization, we only need to keep the terms in the
potential that can give divergent terms in this limit, so we expand the potential in small ﬁelds to
ﬁnd

ψ = −3/L2 and m2

φ = −4/L2, are directly related to the scaling

The actual FGPW model has c = 1 in (5.6), but here we keep the coeﬃcients general. This
will serve to illustrate how the counterterms carry information that is speciﬁcally dependent on
coeﬃcients in the scalar potential; i.e. one should in general expect model-dependent terms in the
counterterm action.

The HJ equation (2.15) for the FGPW model takes the form

R[γ] + K + p2

so we write

We now proceed with solving for the divergent terms of the on-shell action following the algorithmic
procedure described in Section 2.3:

U = U(0) + U(2) + U(4) .

(5.9)

Step 1: We begin by writing the most general Ansatz for each U(i). We only keep terms that
can give divergent contributions. With the scalar falloﬀs (5.5) and each inverse metric giving e−2r,
the most general Ansatz at 0th order is

A1 = A4 = A5 = B1 = 0 .

Step 2: At the leading order, the conjugate momenta obtained from (2.5) must agree with those

Section 3. The terms that are quadratic in the ﬁelds are uniquely ﬁxed by the mass terms in
the scalar potential and are as such universal for all models. Finally, the ψ4-terms are clearly
model-dependent, as can be seen from the explicit dependence on c.

Finally, notice that the combination of the Laplace operator (cid:3) and the Ricci scalar R that appears
in the last term is proportional, up to an overall constant to the conformal Laplacian.

ﬁelds of the FGPW model. The one-point function of the operator dual to ﬁeld φI will be given

where the regularized action (ignoring possible ﬁnite counterterms) is

Sreg = Sbulk + SGH + Sct .

(5.27)

(5.28)

In order to check that the expressions obtained are indeed ﬁnite, one has must impose the equations
of motion on the coeﬃcients in the Feﬀerman-Graham expansion of the ﬁelds. We ﬁnd that with
our inﬁnite counterterms, all three one-point functions in FGPW are indeed ﬁnite. Details are
presented in Appendix C.

6 Renormalization of a dilaton-axion model

In this section we present the procedure of renormalization of a dilaton-axion model. The purpose
of this example is to illustrate how the procedure for holographic renormalization applies to
theories that include marginal scalars. Speciﬁcally, we examine the renormalization of the dilaton-
axion model previously studied in [11]: the 5d bulk action is

with

Sbulk = −

Lm = ∂µϕ∂µϕ + Z(ϕ)∂µχ∂µχ −

L2 .

(6.1)

(6.2)

The ﬁelds ϕ and χ are massless and therefore correspond to marginal QFT operators with
scaling dimension ∆ = 4. Z denotes an arbitrary function of the dilaton ﬁeld ϕ. Near the
asymptotic boundary, these scalars generically do not vanish but instead approach a ﬁnite value.
In particular, their asymptotic behavior is given by

ϕ(x, r) = ϕ(0)(x) + O(cid:16)e−2r/L(cid:17) ,

χ(x, r) = χ(0)(x) + O(cid:16)e−2r/L(cid:17) .

5 In the special case where ∆I = d/2 the one-point function has an extra factor of log ρ.

(6.3)

As a consequence, we cannot regard the eﬀective action as a power-expansion in these ﬁelds, as
higher powers are not suppressed. Instead, we will take the Ansatz to involve general functions of
ϕ and χ.

By deﬁning the ﬁeld Φ to be Φ = (ϕ, χ) and the K¨ahler metric to be G =  1

conclude that the HJ Equation (2.15) now becomes

(6.4)

Let us now examine step-by-step the procedure introduced in the previous sections and spot

any important diﬀerences.

Step 1: With d = 4, we need to keep terms with up to four derivatives:

U = U(0) + U(2) + U(4) .

(6.5)

Taking into account that any possible function of the ﬁelds could give divergent contributions in
the on-shell action we write the following Ansatz for the zero, two and four derivative parts of U
respectively:

(6.7)

(6.6)

U(0) = A(ϕ, χ, r) ,
U(2) = B0R + B1(∇ϕ) · (∇χ) + B2(∇ϕ)2 + B3(∇χ)2 ,
U(4) = C1R2 + C2RijRij + C3R(cid:3)ϕ + C4R(cid:3)χ + C5R(∇ϕ)2 + C6R(∇χ)2 + C7R(∇ϕ) · (∇χ)

+C8Rij∇iϕ∇jϕ + C9Rij∇iχ∇jχ + C10Rij∇iϕ∇jχ + C11((cid:3)ϕ)2 + C12((cid:3)χ)2
+C13(cid:3)ϕ(cid:3)χ + C14∇i∇jϕ∇i∇jϕ + +C15∇i∇jχ∇i∇jχ + +C16∇i∇jϕ∇i∇jχ
+C17(cid:3)ϕ(∇ϕ)2 + C18(cid:3)χ(∇χ)2 + C19(cid:3)ϕ(∇χ)2 + C20(cid:3)ϕ(∇ϕ) · (∇χ)
+ C24(cid:0)(∇χ)2(cid:1)2
+C21(cid:3)χ(∇ϕ)2 + C22(cid:3)χ(∇ϕ) · (∇χ) + C23(cid:0)(∇ϕ)2(cid:1)2
+C25(∇ϕ)2(∇χ)2 + C26((∇ϕ) · (∇χ))2 + C27(∇ϕ)2(∇ϕ) · (∇χ) + C28(∇χ)2(∇ϕ) · (∇χ) .
The coeﬃcients A, Bi and Ci are all considered functions of the radial coordinate r as well as the
ﬁelds ϕ and χ. We have omitted terms that up to total derivatives can be decomposed to the ones
already included. For example, since B(cid:3)ϕ = ∇i(B∇iϕ) − ∂ϕB(∇ϕ)2 − ∂χB(∇ϕ) · (∇χ), such a
term can be absorbed in B1 and B2, so it is redundant to include it in the Ansatz.

(6.8)

Step 2: We use equation (2.5) and the asymptotic behavior of the ﬁelds (6.3) to determine the
leading behavior of pϕ and pχ to be

On the other hand, our Ansatz for U(0) gives

pϕ = ˙ϕ = O(cid:16)e−2r/L(cid:17) ,

pχ = Z(ϕ) ˙χ = O(cid:16)e−2r/L(cid:17) .

pϕ(0) =

δU(0)
δϕ

= ∂ϕA ,

pχ(0) =

δU(0)
δχ

= ∂χA .

(6.9)

(6.10)

By comparing the two sets of expressions for the momenta, we understand that the coeﬃcient A
can neither depend on ϕ nor χ, and thus pϕ(0) and pχ(0) vanish. This leaves U(0) to be purely
gravitational and thus we can use directly our result from Section 3:

U(0) = −

(6.11)

Step 3: We now proceed to solve HJ equation and determine the unknown coeﬃcients of our
Ansatz. Since the zero-derivatives contribution has already been ﬁxed, we start our analysis with
the two-derivative terms. At this order, the HJ equation simpliﬁes to

After plugging everything into the HJ equation, one uses partial integration to eliminate terms
that were not in our original Ansatz and therefore were not independent. Demanding that the
coeﬃcient of each independent term in the resulting HJ equation is zero, one ﬁnds that the two-
derivative contribution to the on-shell action is

and the complicated tensor Y(4)ij is is not needed for the calculation. The total derivatives of Y(4)
will not contribute to HJ equation since they are multiplied by U(0), which is a constant, and total
derivatives can be dropped by the equation.

7 Discussion

We have presented a simple implementation of the Hamiltonian approach to holographic renor-
malization. The idea of using the Hamilton-Jacobi equation is not new, but we hope that our
presentation and algorithm makes the method more accessible and useful for others to use. For
our own purposes, it has shown great value in the application to the holographic renormalization
of a 10 scalar model dual to N = 1∗ gauge theory on S4, an analysis will be presented elsewhere
[15].

Determining the inﬁnite counterterms is typically only one part of holographic renormalization.
One often needs the ﬁnite counterterms too, but just as in standard quantum ﬁeld theory, this
typically amounts to be a scheme-dependent question. However, in the presence of supersymmetry,
one can ﬁx the ﬁnite counterterms to be compatible with the supersymmetries in the problem. In
the case of ﬂat-sliced domain walls, this can be done using the Bogomolnyi-trick of writing the bulk
action in terms of sums of squares that each vanish on the BPS equations. This rewriting requires
a partial integration that leaves a boundary term that exactly becomes the counterterm action
and encodes both inﬁnite and ﬁnite counterterms. In the case of non-ﬂat slicing, one can then
argue that the universality of the counterterms allows one to pick the ﬁnite counterterms of the
ﬂat-space Bogomolnyi boundary term and use them in conjunction with the more general inﬁnite
counterterms discussed in this paper. This has worked successfully in several cases, for example
[13] and [20]. The prescriptions does, however, have a bit of an ad hoc feel to it and it would be
interesting to understand better the relationship between the BPS equations for curved domain
walls and how/if they can be used to determine directly the inﬁnite and ﬁnite counterterms.

B Six derivative counterterms for pure gravity

In d = 6 dimensions one needs to consider counterterms with up to six derivatives. For the pure
gravity case, the six-derivative Ansatz is given by equation (3.4). In this Ansatz, it is possible to
include terms with contractions of two or three Riemann tensors, but it is easy to show that the
coeﬃcients of such terms will be zero.

The HJ equation at six-derivative order becomes

K(6) + 2

∂U(6)

∂r

= 0 .

(B.1)

The total derivatives of Y(4)ij that appear in K(6) are now important because they are multiplied
by the non-constant Y(2)ij = BRij. In particular, we have that

Y(4)ij = C1(cid:18)2RklRikjl +

(cid:3)Rγij + (cid:3)Rij − ∇i∇jR(cid:19) + C2(cid:18)2RRij + 2(cid:3)Rγij − 2∇i∇jR(cid:19) . (B.2)

The coeﬃcients B and C1,2 are those calculated in Section 3. Additionally,
, terms proportional to Rij∇i∇jR can be changed to R∇i∇jRij = 1
2 R(cid:3)R by adding
Y(2)ijY
appropriate total derivatives and using the Bianchi identity. Finally, by using the variation rules
of Appendix A, one realizes that Y(6) = 3U(6) up to total derivative terms that can be ignored
because Y(6) is only multiplied by the constant U(0). Putting everything together and demanding
that the coeﬃcient of each of the independent is zero gives diﬀerential equations for the coeﬃcients

C One-point functions

In this appendix we calculate the one-point functions for the quantum ﬁeld theory operators dual
to the ﬁelds of the FGPW model and explicitly check that the counterterm contributions cancel
the divergences that come from the bulk action. One may consider three diﬀerent one-point
functions, hOφi, hOψi and hTiji, where the QFT operators Oφ/ψ are dual to the bulk ﬁelds φ/ψ
respectively and the QFT energy-momentum tensor Tij is dual to the metric γij.

These one point functions can be calculated by variations of the renormalized action

Sren = lim
ρ→0

Sreg = lim
ρ→0

(Sbulk + SGH + Sct) ,

(C.1)

where the regularized action Sreg is the sum of the bulk action (5.1), the Gibbons-Hawking bound-
ary term, and the counterterm action (5.26). In particular, the three correlation functions are
given by:

hOφi = − lim

and U as calculated in Section 5.

To determine whether the above expressions are ﬁnite, one has to use the Feﬀerman-Graham

expansions for the metric and the scalar ﬁelds of the theory:

γij =

1
ρ

γ(0)ij +(cid:0)γ(2)ij + γ(2,1)ij log ρ(cid:1) + ρ(cid:0)γ(4)ij + γ(4,1)ij log ρ + γ(4,2)ij log2 ρ(cid:1) + O(ρ2) (C.9)

ψ = ρ1/2ψ(0) + ρ3/2(cid:0)ψ(2) + ψ(2,1) log ρ(cid:1) + O(ρ5/2)
φ = ρ(cid:0)φ(0) + φ(0,1) log ρ(cid:1) + O(ρ2)

Notice that for the special case of the φ-ﬁeld there is a logarithmic term even in leading order
in ρ. (This is generally true for all ﬁelds with scaling dimension ∆ = d/2.) All the coeﬃcients
of the above expansions can be determined in terms of γ(0)ij, γ(4)ij , φ(0), φ(0,1), ψ(0) and ψ(2)
using the equations of motion for the ﬁelds and the metric. These undetermined coeﬃcients
encode information about the boundary QFT. Namely, the leading order coeﬃcients φ(0,1) and
ψ(0) are related to the source of the respective QFT operators, while coeﬃcients φ(0) and ψ(2)
are related to their vev rate. Additionally, the leading coeﬃcient γ(0)ij in the expansion of γ is
the background metric of the boundary QFT. Finally, although γ(4)ij is not fully determined, its
trace and covariant divergence can be related to the other expansion coeﬃcients using Einstein’s
equation.

The substitution of the expansion (C.11) for φ into hOφi directly leads to cancellation of all of

the divergences, without using the equations of motion, and the result is

hOφi = −

23

(C.12)

Plugging the expansion (C.10) for ψ into hOψi leads to direct cancellation of the divergent
terms in leading order, i.e. those proportional to 1/ρ, however, a logarithmic divergence remains:

In order to see the desired cancellations, one has to calculate the expansion coeﬃcient ψ(2,1) via
the equation of motion for the ﬁeld ψ,

L2(cid:3)γψ + 4ρ2∂2

ρψ + 4ρ∂ρψ + 2ρ2∂ρψ Tr(γ−1∂ργ) + 3ψ − 2cψ3 = 0 .

(C.15)

By the asymptotic expansions for ψ and the metric, the terms proportional to ρ3/2 give

ψ(2,1) = −

4(cid:16)L2(cid:3)(0) + Tr(γ−1

Finally, γ(2) is determined using Einstein’s equation:

Rµν[g] = ∂µφ∂ν φ + ∂µψ∂ν ψ +

The ij component of this equation is

A similar approach leads to the renormalized one-point function for the energy-momentum
tensor. A direct substitution of the asymptotic expansions in equation (C.7) leads to the cancella-
tion of the leading O(ρ−2) divergences. However, the remaining divergences can be canceled only
after solving Einstein’s equation for γ(4,1) and γ(4,2). Terms proportional to ρ log ρ give

The trace of the stress-tensor one-point function gives a much simpler expression, since the trace
