The structure of d∗(2380) is re-studied with the single cluster structure in the chiral SU(3) quark
model which has successfully been employed to explain the scattering and binding behaviors of
baryonic systems. The mass and width are explicitly calculated with two types of trial wave func-
tions. The result shows that the (0s)6[6]orb conﬁguration is easy to convert to the conﬁguration
with the same [6]orb symmetry but 2ω excitation back and forth, however, it is seldom to turn
into a two-cluster conﬁguration with a (1s) relative motion in between. The resultant mass and
width are about 2394MeV and 25MeV, respectively, and the stable size is about 0.75f m, which are
consistent with both the results in the two-cluster conﬁguration calculation and the data measured
by the COSY collaboration. It seems that the observed d∗ is a six-quark dominated exotic state
with a spherical shape and breath mode in the coordinate space. Moreover, if d∗ does have 2ω
excitation, the d∗
→ npπππ decay mode might be a good place to distinguish the real structure
of the observed phenomenon by COSY. The masses of various isospin-spin states of six-light-quark
systems are also computed. It is shown that by considering the coupling with the conﬁgurations
with 2ω excitations, only the mirror state with IS=30 will be lower down to the place where whose
mass is slightly higher than the value of the ∆∆ threshold.

INTRODUCTION

During past years, a resonant structure d∗(2380) has
been reported in the double-pion fusion reactions pn →
dπ0π0 and pn → dπ+π− by the WASA collaboration
[1, 2]. Later on, this resonance has also been observed in
pn → pnπ0π0, pn → ppπ−π0, pd → 3He π0π0, pd →
3He π+π−, dd → 4He π0π0, and dd → 4He π+π−
reactions[3–8], and conﬁrmed by the angular distribution
and analyzing power data, together with the partial wave
analysis, as a genuine state[8, 9]. The data show that
d∗(2380) has a mass of 2380 MeV, a width of Γ ≈ 70MeV,
and an isospin-spin-parity being I(J P ) = 0(3+).

Since the mass of d∗(2380) is far away from the thresh-
olds of the ∆∆, ∆N π, N N ππ channels, the threshold
eﬀect is expected to be smaller than that in some ex-
otic XYZ states[10, 11]. The structural uncertainty in
studying d∗(2380) would be greatly reduced. On the
other hand, although observed mass is much higher than
∆N π, N N ππ channels, its width is only 70 MeV, which
is much smaller than the width of two ∆s. The fact
that the width of d∗(2380) is remarkably small excludes
the scenario of the naive colorless ∆∆ molecular struc-
ture, and indicates the hidden color channel should be
signiﬁcant[12, 13]. Due to these extraordinary proper-
ties, d∗(2380) becomes a good platform to investigate
new physics in the hadronic system.

The properties of dibaryon states was ﬁrstly discussed
by Dyson and Xuong in 1964 in a framework of SU(6)

∗Electronic address: lvqifang@ihep.ac.cn

symmetry where no dynamics is considered [14]. Since
then, various theoretical investigations on dibaryon have
been performed [15–25]. Recently, Gal and Garcilazo
studied the πN ∆ system in a Faddeev type three-body
calculation and dynamically generated a pole where its
mass and width are close to the data of COSY, although
some crude approximations were employed [18, 19]. In
Ref. [20], Huang, et al, investigated the binding behav-
ior of the ∆∆ system in a coupled channel calculation in
the framework of the chiral SU(2) model and obtained
a binding energy of about 71MeV and a width of about
150MeV, which is much larger than the reported data.
Even in a QCD sum rule calculation, one also got a mass
of 2.4 ± 0.2 GeV[21].

It is noteworthy that in a much earlier calculation in
the chiral SU(3) quark model, the binding property of the
∆∆ system with I(J P ) = I(SP ) = 0(3+), where I, J(or
S), and P stand for the isospin, spin, and parity, re-
spectively, was studied by including a hidden color (CC)
component , and a bound state with a binding energy of
40 − 80MeV relative to the threshold of the ∆∆ channel
was predicted[13, 22]. After the new discovery by COSY,
more detailed calculations for such a state have been per-
formed on the base of the chiral SU(3) quark model and
extended chiral SU(3) quark model[23–25]. In the frame-
work of the Resonating Group Method (RGM), the mass
and wave function of the state are obtained by dynam-
ically solving the coupled-channel equations where the
coupling of the ∆∆ channel with a hidden color chan-
nel has been considered. The partial decay widths of the
d∗ → d π0π0 and d∗ → d π+π− processes are evaluated
in terms of the extracted wave function, and the total
width of d∗ is then obtained via the branching ratio data

reported by the COSY collaboration. It is shown that
due to a large CC component in the system, the resul-
tant mass and width can well explain the data, especially,
such a component plays an essential role in interpreting
the narrow width. Thus, one conjectured that d∗(2380)
might be a hexaquark dominated exotic state.

Inspired by a large CC component in d∗(2380) and
a small size in the coordinate space, it is reasonable to
study the (IS) = (03) six quark system in an alternative
model space with a single cluster conﬁguration (SCC).
On the other hand, according to Harvey’s relation from
the group theory, in a six quark system, single-cluster
conﬁgurations and two-cluster conﬁgurations (TCC) can
transform to each other via Fierz transformation.
In
this sense, if d∗(2380) is a hexaquark dominated state,
the major characters obtained in the TCC calculation,
say the binding behavior and the narrow width, should
also appear in the SCC calculation. This is because that
by re-arranging the form of the wave function obtained
in the TCC calculation, one ﬁnds that the main com-
ponent in TCC is also a genuine six-quark conﬁgura-
tion (0s)6[6]orb[111111]SIC, or called hexaquark conﬁg-
uration. Therefore, in order to see whether SCC has the
same properties as those obtained in the TCC calcula-
tion, in this work, we would re-study such a six quark
system in a SCC calculation with the same chiral SU(3)
quark model and the same model parameters. We choose
two types of trial wave functions in the SCC calculation.
One consists of a (0s)6[6]orb[111111]SIC component plus
two 2ω-excited components, both of which are orthog-
onal to the wave function of the excited center of mass
motion and also to each other. The other one includes
the same (0s)6[6]orb[111111]SIC component plus a com-
ponent where a (1s) relative wave function intervenes
between two three-quark ∆ clusters. The results show
that the ﬁrst type of trial wave function has about 80%
(0s)6[6]orb[111111]SIC component, and its main proper-
ties basically consist with those obtained in our previous
two-channel RGM calculation.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sect.II, the for-
malism for both interaction and wave functions is brieﬂy
introduced. The results and discussions are shown in
Sect.III. Finally, a short summary is given in Sect.IV.

II. BRIEF FORMULISM

A.

Interaction

The SU(2) linear σ model has been widely used in
hadron physics for years. In order to better describe vari-
ous types of data of the hadronic system with light ﬂavors
systematically, this model was extrapolated to the ﬂavor
SU(3), and a chiral SU(3) quark model is established[26].
The interactive Lagrangian between the quark and chiral

ﬁelds in such a model is written as

where gch is the coupling constant of quark with the
chiral ﬁeld, ψ is the quark ﬁeld, and σa and πa (a =
0, 1, ..., 8) are the scalar and pseudo-scalar nonet chiral
ﬁelds, respectively. Then, the interactive Hamiltonian
can be obtained by,

F (q

(3)

with Λ being the cutoﬀ mass that corresponds to the
scale of the chiral symmetry breaking[27–29]. From
this Hamiltonian, the chiral ﬁeld caused quark-quark
interaction V σa and V πa, which mainly provide the
medium-range interaction from the non-perturbative
QCD (NPQCD), can easily be derived. To reasonably
present the short-range interaction from the perturbative
QCD (pQCD), one-gluon-exchange interaction V OGE is
still needed. Meanwhile, a phenomenological conﬁning
potential V conf should also be adopted to account for
the long-range interaction from NPQCD. As the total
Hamiltonian of a six-quark system in the chiral SU(3)
quark model, it can be written as

The explicit expressions of theses potentials can be found
in Ref.[26]. In this work, preference is given to the chi-
ral SU(3) quark model with a linear conﬁning potential,
and corresponding model parameters are listed in Ta-
ble.I. It should specially be mentioned that the values of
these parameters are determined by ﬁtting the data of
the baryon masses and the mass splittings between octet
baryons, the stability conditions of baryons, the data of
the baryon-baryon scattering, and the binding energy of
the deuteron. These values are exactly the same as those
in our previous two channel calculations except the values

replaced by a linear one[25]. It should be mentioned that
since the inter-cluster interaction in the N -N case inter-
venes between two color singlets, the color conﬁnement
will not cause any visible eﬀect between them. There-
fore, replacing the quadratic conﬁning potential with a
linear one would not aﬀect both scattering and binding
results [25, 26]. But in the SCC calculation, adopting a
linear conﬁnement is more suitable and reliable. we will
go back to this point in the next section.

B. Wave function

Now, we select the trial wave function of the six-quark
system in the model space of SCC. Since the ground state
of the six-quark system with (IS) = (03) and L = 0 in
this model space is

(6)

ψ0 =(cid:0)(0s)6[6]orb[111111]SIC(cid:1)(IS)=(03) ,

where (0s) is the ground state harmonic oscillator, i.e.
in the coordinate space, the quark stays in the (0s) or-
bit. As shown in Ref. [30], this conﬁguration is not
adequate to describe the system, therefore the compo-
nents with higher excitations should be included. On
the other hand, the result in the TCC calculation shows
that the CC component in the wave function of d∗ has a
rather large fraction, about 2/3. By re-organizing such
a wave function (refer to Fig.1b in Ref.[23]) to form a
((0s)6[6]orb[111111]SIC)(IS)=(03) state, one sees that such
a state has a fraction of about 80% in the total wave
function. That is one of the main reason why we plan to
inspect the structure of d∗ in a SCC calculation. Besides,
the rest component has a one-node structure, namely it
looks like a (1s) radially excited wave function, see the
right diagram in Fig. 1. Thus, we can assume that the
additional wave functions which supplement the inade-
quacy of ψ0 in describing d∗ in the lowest order should
have some 2ω excitation conﬁgurations. In the SCC of
this six quark system, we consider three conﬁgurations
with a 2ω excitation. They are

(cid:0)(0s)5(1s)[6]orb[111111]SIC(cid:1)(IS)=(03) ,
(cid:0)(0s)4(0p)2[6]orb[111111]SIC(cid:1)(IS)=(03) ,

As mentioned above, the TCC calculation tells us that

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

It is well known that due to the NPQCD eﬀect, the
conﬁning potential prefers a linear form. According to
the lattice calculation, it even tends to a color screened
form whose strength is weaker than that of the linear one
at the larger separation between quarks. In the spectrum
study of hadron, because the mass scale is about GeV,
the NPQCD eﬀect must be nonnegligible, consequently
the spectrum is sensitive to the form of the conﬁning
potential, especially in the SCC calculation. In order to
get a valuable prediction to the spectrum, it is better to
take a linear form or even color screened form for the
conﬁning potential. Therefore, in this study, we take a
linear conﬁning potential rather than a quadratic one in
the chiral SU(3) quark model.

Solving the eigenvalue equation and varying the varia-
tional parameter b, the width parameter of the harmonic
wave function of quark, one obtains the mass and the
wave function of d∗(2380). We tabulate the results in
Tab.II. For reference, we also put the results in the TCC
calculation in the table.

and ψ(I)

It should be reiterated that in the Set I case, since both
ψ(I)
2 have 2ω excitation and are orthogonal to
the 2ω excitation of the CM motion and also orthogonal
to each other, no spurious excited states of the CM mo-
tion exist in the trial wave function, and result would be
meaningful. The result obtained with such a trial wave
function shows that without the conﬁguration mixing,
the mass of the system is about 2525MeV, however with
the 2ω components mixing in, it immediately reduces
to 2394MeV which is 70MeV lower than the ∆∆ thresh-
old and consists with the mass of 2416MeV obtained in
the TCC calculation. This means that some 2ω con-
ﬁgurations couple strongly to the 0ω conﬁguration, the
mixing eﬀect is enormous. Nevertheless, in this struc-
ture, the 0ω component ψ0 which has the spatial sym-
metry [6] still remains a fraction of 81% and constitutes
the dominant structure. The 2ω component ψ(I)
2 , whose
spatial symmetry is also [6], has a fraction of 16% and

4

would provides a considerable inﬂuence on the mass of
the system. But the fraction of the 2ω component ψ(I)
that has the spatial symmetry [42] is only about 2.6%,
which implies that this component would not make too
much contribution to the mass of the system.

1

This issue can also be understood by a rough estimate
in terms of the hamiltonian matrix elements. The value
of the transition matrix element between ψ0 and ψ(I)
is
1
about 100MeV which is relatively smaller than the mass
diﬀerence of 350MeV between these two conﬁgurations.
So it only mildly suppresses the mass of the ψ0 conﬁg-
uration, which implies that the coupling between these
two components is weak. However, the transition ma-
trix element between ψ0 and ψ(I)
2 has a quite large value
of 255MeV, which is comparable with mass diﬀerence of
about 428MeV between these two conﬁgurations. Then
the ψ(I)
conﬁguration would substantially suppress fur-
ther the mass of the new lower conﬁguration where the
major component is ψ0. It means that ψ(I)
couples to ψ0
2
strongly, or can easily convert to each other. The rela-
tively easy conversion between the two spatial [6] symme-
try conﬁgurations, which have the 0ω and 2ω excita-
tions respectively, indicates that such a six-quark system
is totally symmetric in the coordinate space and has a
breath mode.

2

Moreover, the size of this system is about 0.75f m,
which is also close to the RMS of 0.88f m found in the
TCC RGM calculation. Comparing with the results in
the TCC calculation, a little bit smaller size in the SCC
calculation ﬁts to a smaller mass (or larger binding en-
ergy with respect to the ∆∆ threshold) in SCC. It seems
that with this coupled structure Ψ(I)
6q in the SCC model
space, one can also explain the mass of the observed d∗
state.

1

1

However, in the Set II case, the situation is quite diﬀer-
ent. Without conﬁguration mixing, namely no coupling
between ψ0 and ψ(II)
, the mass of d∗ is about 2505MeV,
it is 41MeV higher than the ∆∆ threshold. With conﬁg-
uration mixing, namely considering the coupling between
ψ0 and ψ(II)
, the mass of d∗ reduces to 2500MeV which is
only 5MeV smaller than that in the case without conﬁgu-
ration mixing. It indicates that the coupling eﬀect here is
rather weak, namely the conﬁguration with ((0s)6)orb is
diﬃcult to transit to the conﬁguration with (1s) relative
motion between two ∆s ( (∆∆)χ1s(rrel) ), so that the
fraction of ψ0 reaches 99% and only less than 1% ψ(II)
is mixed in.

1

1

This argument can also be cross-checked by the hamil-
tonian matrix elements. The transition matrix element
from ψ(II)
to ψ0 is rather small, only 4MeV. But, the
mass diﬀerence between these two conﬁgurations is huge,
about 400MeV which is almost two orders larger than
the value of the transition matrix element. This observa-
tion tells us that ψ0 is diﬃcult to transit to the colorless
two-cluster conﬁguration with (1s) relative wave func-
tion, and the weaker coupling between these two conﬁg-
urations results the small mass shift for the lower con-

ﬁguration. Therefore, from the mass point of view, the
structure of trial wave function Ψ(II)
6q would not ﬁt to the
d∗ state.

Next, we would estimate the width of the d∗ state in
the SCC calculation. Since the mass of d∗ in the Set II
case is larger than the threshold of ∆∆, it is not necessary
to discuss the width of d∗. We only focus on the width
in the Set I case. It could be done by using the method
employed in Ref. [24]. According to Harvey’s relation
[31] from the group theory, symmetry basis function ψ0
of a six-quark cluster can be expressed by physical basis
functions with two three-quark clusters, as:

ψ0 = (0s)6[6]orb[111111]SIC

= r 1

5

(∆∆)IS=03 +r 4

5

(CC)IS=03.

(12)

Then, 20% (∆∆) components in ψ0 can decay into dππ,
npππ and relevant channels [24]. In the coordinate space,
the structures of other two conﬁgurations in set I can be
re-written as

(ψ(I)

ter being radially excited to the 1s orbit in the co-
ordinate space. Then ψ(I)
also have chance
to decay into dππ, npππ and relevant channels, which
can be evaluated in terms of the method employed in
Ref.[24] as well, although the produced width might be
smaller. The roughly estimated partial decay widths of
the d∗ → dπ0π0 process show that the major contribu-
tion comes from ψ0, which is about 2.86MeV. Comparing
with this width, contributions from ψ(I)
2 are rel-
atively smaller, which are, respectively, only about 11%
and 3%of the ψ0’s. The obtained partial width, and con-
sequently the width of d*, is smaller than the experi-
mental value, which tells us that the assumed trial wave
function Ψ(I)
6q dose not well approach to the reality of
the observed phenomenon due to an improper cutoﬀ in
choosing it. A more careful study should be carried out

and ψ(I)

further. However, the six quark structure still gives the
main characters of d∗, the mass is much higher than ∆N π
and N N ππ channels, and its width is much smaller than
the width of two ∆s.

Comparing these results with those in the TCC
calculation, we have following observations.
ψ0 =
((0s)6[6]orb[111111]SIC)IS=03 is a dominant component
and has a fraction of more than 80% in Ψ(I)
6q . The size
for the system being stable is about 0.75f m. These fea-
tures are similar to those obtained in the TCC calcula-
tion. However, the resultant decay widths show that it
is smaller than that in the TCC calculation, although it
seems not contradictory to the data. The reason is that
the wave function in SCC is more compact than that in
TCC, so this conﬁguration would not decay as easy as
the conﬁguration in the TCC calculation does. Besides
the decay from the common component ψ0, in which only
20% ∆∆ component can decay into colorless ﬁnal states,
the other components ψ(I)
1 , which have been
treated as diﬀerent combinations of ∆∆∗, where we as-
sume ∆∗ could be regard as ∆∗(1600) (3/2)+, with rel-
ative 0s wave and ∆∆ with relative 1s wave, can also
decay into colorless ﬁnal states. Since the branching ra-
tios of the N π decay mode for ∆∗(1600) (3/2)+ is almost
one order smaller than that for ∆, the decay rates from
ψ(I)
are much smaller than that from the wave
function other than ψ0 in the TCC calculation.

It should specially be noted that in the Set I case, if
we regard ∆∗ as ∆∗(1600) (3/2)+, the branching ratios
of the decay mode ∆∗(1600) (3/2)+ → N ππ is about
75 − 90%. This implies that d∗ can have the N N πππ
decay mode, and this decay mode might be a good place
to distinguish the structure of d∗, because it would not
appear in a d∗ structure where no ∆ excitations, for in-
stance ∆N π, exist.

Moreover, in the Set I case, the masses obtained in the
SCC calculation diﬀer with those in the TCC calculation
by 20 − 30MeV. The reason could be the following: In
the TCC calculation, both clusters have a certain size
which disenables them getting very close to each other,
but no such restriction in the SCC calculation. This is
an important diﬀerence between SCC and TCC model
spaces. Moreover, the characters of the other components
mixed in are also diﬀerent. In the TCC calculation, the
component other than ψ0 looks like some highly excited
relative (ns) waves between two clusters, for example rel-
ative (1s) wave between two ∆’s, see right-hand diagram
in Fig. 1, but in the SCC calculation, it is mainly a com-
ponent of (0s)5(1s)[6]orb[111111]SIC, which looks like a
spherical six-quark state with a breath mode. In a word,
the origin of the diﬀerence is the choice of the bases in
the TCC and SCC calculations. In principle, two types
of basis sets can convert to each other as long as they
are complete. However, no matter in the TCC or SCC
calculation, the basis functions are all truncated to a few
lower conﬁgurations, it would cause diﬀerences in results.
Fortunately, as we expected, the main features of results
in both types of calculations are similar to each other:

the mass of the system (d∗) is a few tens of MeV below
the value of the ∆∆ threshold, and the main component
of d∗ is a six-quark state ((0s)6[6]orb[111111]SIC)IS=03,
namely d∗ is a six-quark dominated exotic state. This is
a system where the interaction has an attractive feature
in the short-distance we have ever seen. Just because of
such an attraction, the system becomes very compact,
and forms a six-quark state with a narrow width.

of the IS = 01, 10, 12, and 21 states are all much
larger than the thresholds of corresponding baryon-
baryon states about 200 − 450MeV. It seems not pos-
sible to form a bound state by including 2ω and even
higher excited conﬁgurations. Because of the noncom-
pact character of these four states, it is better to study
their binding behavior by performing the TCC calcula-
tion. For the state with IS = 30, its mass is 115MeV
higher than the ∆∆ threshold, mixing in 2ω excited
conﬁgurations might lead to a resonance with a mass of
2475MeV, which is very close to the ∆∆ threshold. This
result is diﬀerent with that of the d∗ state. The reason
for such a diﬀerence is due to its repulsive nature from
the one-gluon-exchange interaction between two ∆s, al-
though the symmetry character is as good as that of the
IS=03 d∗ state.

IV. SUMMARY

In this paper, the mass and width of d∗(2380) are stud-
ied in the SCC approximation within the chiral SU(3)
quark model. Two types of trial wave functions are em-
ployed. One of them Ψ(I)
6q , called Set I, is constituted by
orb and wave functions ψ(I)
a wave function ψ0 with (0s)6
and ψ(I)
2 with a 2ω excitation in the orbital space. The
other one Ψ(II)
is composed of a same wave function ψ0
plus a wave function ψ(II)
in a form of (∆∆)χ1s(rrel).
Minimizing the mass of the system by adjusting the vari-
ation parameter bu, the width parameter of the wave
function of a quark, a stable mass can be obtained. It

is shown that in the Set I case, the coupling between ψ0
is rather strong but that between ψ0 and ψ(I)
and ψ(I)
1
exhibits a quite weak character. This means that the
six-quark system can easily convert between the 0ω and
2ω modes which have the same [6] spatial symmetry.
Then, the structure of d∗ looks like a spherical ball with
a breath mode in the coordinate space. As a result, if
the six quark system has the structure of Ψ(I)
6q , its sta-
ble mass reduces to about 2394MeV, the stable size is
about 0.75f m, and the roughly estimated width is about
25MeV, which mainly contributed by ψ0 and partly by
1 and ψ(I)
ψ(I)
2 . It indicates that the main features of d∗, a
binding behavior with respect to the ∆∆ threshold and
a narrow width, can also be produced in the SCC calcu-
lation, although the resultant width underestimates but
still not contradicts the data. It again supports that the
d∗ state might be a hexaquark dominated state. How-
ever, in the Set II case, the mass of the system with
the coupling between ψ0 and ψ(II)
, is about 2500MeV,
which is much higher than the observed mass by COSY.
This implies that this is not the case for the structure of
d∗(2380).

An interesting feature of Ψ(I)
6q

is that because it has
components with 2ω excitations, the system should have
npπππ decay mode. Although their decay rates might be
very small, they would be one of the criterion to distin-
guish whether d∗ is a hexaquark dominated state or a
hadronic molecular-like state.

Combining with the issues from the TCC calculation,
we consider that d∗(2380) looks like a hexaquark domi-
nated system in a spherical shape with a breath mode in
the orbital space.

For comparison, the masses of various isospin-spin
states of six-light-quark systems are also calculated. It
is shown that for the states with IS = 01, 10, 12, and
21, their masses are 200 − 450MeV higher than the cor-
responding baryon-baryon thresholds. It is not possible
to form a bound structure by including additional com-
ponents with 2ω excitations. However, as the mirror
state of the IS = 03 state, the IS = 30 state state with
0ω conﬁguration has a stable mass of about 115MeV
higher than the ∆∆ threshold. Coupling with the conﬁg-
urations with 2ω excitations might lead to a resonance
with a mass of 2475MeV, which is very close to the ∆∆
threshold.
