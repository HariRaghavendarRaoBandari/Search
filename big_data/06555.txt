Abstract

We present ﬁrst principles study of thermoelectric transport properties of sandwiched heterostructure of

Graphene (G)/hexagonal Boron Nitride (BN)/G, based on Boltzmann transport theory for band electrons

using the bandstructure calculated from the Density Functional Theory (DFT) based plane-wave method.

Calculations were carried out for three, four and ﬁve BN layers sandwiched between Graphene layers with
three diﬀerent arrangements to obtain the Seebeck coeﬃcient and Power factor in T ∼ 25 − 400K range.
Moreover, using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations with very large simulation cell we obtained the

thermal conductance (K) of these heterostructures and obtained ﬁnally the Figure-of-Merit (ZT ). These

results are in agreement with recently reported experimental measurements.

for chemical potentials lower than the Fermi energy, S = 0

at Fermi energy and S < 0 for values greater the Fermi en-

ergy. The sign of S indicates the sign of the majority charge

carriers. This is also observed experimentally when the gate

voltage crosses the charge neutrality point (CNP). S = 0 at

the CNP. We thus see a direct correspondence between chem-

ical potential and gate voltage. Thus, the gate voltage can

tune the chemical potential. As seen in Fig 2, the chemical

potential changes sign at the Fermi level. The eﬀect of chem-

ical potential on S can thus be demonstrated by tuning the

chemical potential (Fermi energy EF ).

We would like to mention that we have calculated the the

components of σ along the cartesian axes, with z-axis being

normal to the plane of the G/h-BN/G heterostructure, shown

in [30]. Then using the Mott’s formula 4 we obtained the See-

beck coeﬃcients along the principal directions [30]. We have

obtained a ﬁnite Sz near the Fermi energy which contributes

to the total Seebeck coeﬃcient which could be due to periodic

boundary condition. We feel that the electrical conduction

along the z-axis should include contributions also from the

other two principal directions, as planar Graphene is used as

the contact on both sides of multi-layer h-BN in the experiment

the experimental value at T =300K [12]. The inset shows the

Seebeck coeﬃcient plotted against Temperature at a constant

Though the band gap of G/h-BN/G heterostructure is

formed due to h-BN, the Fermi level does not shift since the

number of boron atoms is equal to the number of nitrogen

atoms. Further, since boron is an acceptor whereas nitrogen

is a donor, the total number of charge carriers n remains the

same as that in graphene and hence the conductance at low

√

temperatures, which is essentially proportional to

n is essen-

tially that of graphene [42]. We therefore expect that the form

of S, which depends only on conductivity, to have a similar

form as that of graphene. In Fig. 2 we see that, as expected,

the form of S is that of graphene. However, at very low tem-

peratures the Seebeck coeﬃcient has a ﬂat region around the

Fermi energy which is due to the band gap.

In the 40K - 300K temperature (T ) range it is seen that the

pared with the available experimental results of Jo et al [13].

For each calculation, the system was thermalized to the desired

temperature ﬁrst for each set of initial uniform distribution of

velocities. κ was calculated for ﬁve diﬀerent sets of initial ve-

locities and the error bar was estimated from the standard

deviation.

We found κ increases with T and tend to saturate at
T ∼ 220K for each samples of h-BN, with results for 11-layer
tending towards the bulk value. Moreover, for each of the three

samples of h-BN multilayered ﬁlms, κ shows maxima in the

erostructures with three-, four- and ﬁve-layers of h-BN at the

ﬁxed chemical potential has been shown in Fig 6. The chem-

Seebeck coeﬃcient of -99.3 µV/K as shown in Fig 2. Note,

we have plotted the thermal conductance in Fig 6, obtained

by multiplying the thermal conductivity (κ) with the height of

the G/h-BN/G heterostructure as indicated in Fig 1. Similarly,

for the Power Factor (S2G), we have taken G as the electrical

conductance, so that ZT becomes a dimensionless quantity.

It can be seen from Fig 3 that as we increase the number of

layers, the power factor increases whereas the thermal conduc-

tivity decreases with temperature. As a result the power factor
