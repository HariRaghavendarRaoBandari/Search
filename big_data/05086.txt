Abstract

We determine the exact values of the linear complexity of 2p-
periodic quaternary sequences over Z4 (the residue class ring modulo
4) deﬁned from the generalized cyclotomic classes modulo 2p in terms
of the theory of of Galois rings of characteristic 4, where p is an odd
prime. Compared to the case of quaternary sequences over the ﬁnite
ﬁeld of order 4, it is more diﬃcult and complicated to consider the
roots of polynomials in Z4[X] due to the zero divisors in Z4 and hence
brings some interesting twists. We prove the main results as follows

Introduction

Due to applications of quaternary sequences in communication systems, radar
and cryptography [9], it is of interest to design large families of quaternary
sequences.

Certain quaternary sequences were deﬁned in the literature1 by using
generalized cyclotomic classes modulo 2p for an odd prime p. Let g be
an odd number such that g is a primitive root modulo p and modulo 2p
simultaneously. We note that such g always exits, see [11]. We denote by
Z2p = {0, 1, . . . , 2p − 1} the residue class ring modulo 2p. Put

D0 = hg2i = {g2n

(mod 2p) : n = 0, 1, . . . , (p − 3)/2} ⊂ Z2p,

and

D1 = {g2n+1

(mod 2p) : n = 0, 1, . . . , (p − 3)/2} ⊂ Z2p.

If we write Ei = {2u (mod 2p) : u ∈ Di} for i = 0, 1, we have the following
partition

Z2p = D0 ∪ D1 ∪ E0 ∪ E1 ∪ {0, p}.

We remark that D0 ∪ D1 is exactly the set of all odd numbers in Z2p \ {p}
and E0 ∪ E1 is exactly the set of all even numbers in Z2p \ {0}.

In terms of the generalized cyclotomic classes above, Chen and Du [4]
deﬁned a family of quaternary sequences (eu)u≥0 with elements in the ﬁnite
ﬁeld F4 = {0, 1, α, 1 + α} as

0,

[2, 3, 21].

They determined the linear complexity of (eu)u≥0 in [4]. Later Ke, Yang and
Zhang [12] calculated their autocorrelation values2 . In fact, before [4, 12]
Kim, Hong and Song [14] deﬁned another family of quaternary sequences
(su)u≥0 with elements in Z4 = {0, 1, 2, 3}, the residue class ring modulo 4, as
follows

if i = 0 or i ∈ D0,
if i ∈ D1,
if i = p or i ∈ E0,
if i ∈ E1.

They derived the periodic3 autocorrelation function of (su)u≥0. However, as
we know, the linear complexity of (su)u≥0 is still open since it faces more
diﬃculties due to the phenomenon of zero divisors in Z4. In this work, we
will develop a way to solve this problem using the theory of Galois rings of
characteristic 4. We note that there are many quaternary sequences over Z4
have been investigated in the literature, see e.g., [17, 18, 6, 7, 8].

We recall that the linear complexity LC((su)u≥0) of (su)u≥0 above is the
least order L of a linear recurrence relation (i.e., linear feedback shift register,
or LFSR for short) over Z4

su+L + c1su+L−1 + . . . + cL−1su+1 + cLsu = 0 for u ≥ 0,

which is satisﬁed by (su)u≥0 and where c1, c2, . . . , cL ∈ Z4, see [19]. The
connection polynomial is C(X) given by 1 + c1X + . . . + cLX L. We note that
C(0) = 1. Let

S(X) = s0 + s1X + . . . + s2p−1X 2p−1 ∈ Z4[X]

be the generating polynomial of (su)u≥0. Then an LFSR with a connection
polynomial C(X) generates (su)u≥0, if and only if [19],

S(X)C(X) ≡ 0

(mod X 2p − 1).

That is,

LC((su)u≥0) = min{deg(C(X)) : S(X)C(X) ≡ 0

(mod X 2p − 1)}.

(2)

2Ke and Zhang extended to deﬁne quaternary cyclotomic sequences of length 2pm [13].
Chang and Li deﬁned quaternary cyclotomic sequences of length 2pq [1]. Both are over
the ﬁnite ﬁeld F4.

3The period of (su)u≥0 is 2p.

Let r be the order of 2 modulo p. We denote by GR(4r, 4) the Galois
ring of order 4r of characteristic 4, which is isomorphic to the residue class
ring Z4[X]/(f (X)), where f (X) ∈ Z4[X] is a basic irreducible polynomial
of degree r, see [20, 15]. The group of units of GR(4r, 4) is denoted by
GR∗(4r, 4), which contains a cyclic subgroup of order 2r − 1. Since p|(2r − 1),
let β ∈ GR∗(4r, 4) be of order p. Then we ﬁnd that4 γ = 3β ∈ GR∗(4r, 4) is of
order 2p. From (2), we will consider the values S(γv) for v = 0, 1, . . . , 2p − 1,
which allow us to derive the linear complexity of (su)u≥0. Due to S(X) ∈
Z4[X], we cannot consider it in the same way as those in ﬁnite ﬁelds. For
example, 1 and 3 are the roots of 2X − 2 ∈ Z4[X], but 2X − 2 is not
divisible by (X − 1)(X − 3), i.e., in the ring Z4[X] the number of roots of
a polynomial can be greater than its degree. So we need to develop some
necessary technique here. Indeed, the theory of Galois ring enters into our
problem by means of the following lemmas.

Lemma 1. Let P (X) ∈ Z4[X] be a non-constant polynomial. If ξ ∈ GR(4r, 4)
is a root of P (X), we have P (X) = (X − ξ)Q1(X) for some polynomial
Q1(X) ∈ GR(4r, 4)[X].

Furthermore, if η ∈ GR(4r, 4) is another root of P (X) and η −ξ is a unit,

we have P (X) = (X − ξ)(X − η)Q2(X), where Q1(X) = (X − η)Q2(X).

Lemma 2. Let γ ∈ GR∗(4r, 4) be of order 2p, and let P (X) ∈ Z4[X] be any
non-constant polynomial.

(I). If P (γv) = 0 for all v ∈ Di, where i = 0, 1, then we have

P (X) = P1(X) Yv∈Di

(X − γv)

for some polynomial P1(X) ∈ GR(4r, 4)[X]. Similarly, If P (γv) = 0 for all
v ∈ Ei, where i = 0, 1, then we have

P (X) = P2(X) Yv∈Ei

(X − γv)

for some polynomial P2(X) ∈ GR(4r, 4)[X].

(II). If P (γv) = 0 for all v ∈ {p} ∪ D0 ∪ D1, then we have

P (X) = P3(X)(X p + 1)

4In the context we always suppose that γ ∈ GR∗(4r, 4) is of order 2p.

4

for some polynomial P3(X) ∈ GR(4r, 4)[X]. Similarly, if P (γv) = 0 for all
v ∈ {0} ∪ E0 ∪ E1, then we have

P (X) = P4(X)(X p − 1)

for some polynomial P4(X) ∈ Z4[X].

(III). If P (0) = 1, P (γv) = 0 for v ∈ Z2p \ {0, p}, and P (±1) ∈ {0, 2},
then we have deg P (X) ≥ 2p − 1. Furthermore, if either P (1) = P (−1) = 0
or P (1) = P (−1) = 2, we have deg P (X) ≥ 2p.

We give a proof of both lemmas in the Appendix for the convenience of

the reader.

2 Linear complexity of (su)u≥0

2.1 Auxiliary lemmas

We describe a relationship among D0, D1, E0 and E1.

Lemma 3. Let i, j ∈ {0, 1}.
(I). For v ∈ Di, we have

vDj , {vu (mod 2p) : u ∈ Dj} = Di+j mod 2,

and

vEj , {vu (mod 2p) : u ∈ Ej} = Ei+j mod 2.

(II). For v ∈ Ei, we have

vDj , {vu (mod 2p) : u ∈ Dj} = Ei+j mod 2,

and

vEj , {vu (mod 2p) : u ∈ Ej} = Ei+j mod 2

if p ≡ ±1 (mod 8), and otherwise

vEj , {vu (mod 2p) : u ∈ Ej} = Ei+j+1 mod 2.

(III). If p ≡ ±1 (mod 8), we have

Di = {(v + p)

(mod 2p) : v ∈ Ei},

5

and otherwise

Di+1 mod 2 = {(v + p)

(mod 2p) : v ∈ Ei}.

(IV). If p ≡ ±1 (mod 8), we have

Ei = {(v + p)

(mod 2p) : v ∈ Di},

and otherwise

Ei+1 mod 2 = {(v + p)

(mod 2p) : v ∈ Di}.

(V). If p ≡ ±1 (mod 8), we have

Ei = {u + p : u ∈ Di, u < p} ∪ {u − p : u ∈ Di, u > p}.

Proof. (I). If v ∈ Di for i = 0, 1 and u ∈ Dj for j = 0, 1 then we can write
that v ≡ gi+2k (mod 2p), 0 ≤ k ≤ (p − 3)/2 and u ≡ gj+2l (mod 2p), 0 ≤
l ≤ (p − 3)/2. So, vu ≡ gi+j+2k+2l (mod 2p), hence vu ∈ Di+j mod 2. Since
|vDi| = |Di+j mod 2|, it follows that vDi = Di+j mod 2. The equality vEj =
Ei+j+1 mod 2 may be proved similarly as the ﬁrst.

(II). Let v ∈ Ei. We write v ≡ 2u (mod 2p), u ∈ Di. Therefore, by (I)

and our deﬁnitions we have that

vDj = 2uDj = 2Di+j mod 2 = Ei+j mod 2.

Now, we consider vEj. First, we have by (I) again

vEj = 2uEj = 2Ei+j mod 2.

Second, for any w ∈ 2Ei+j mod 2, we can write w ≡ 4a (mod 2p) for a ∈
Di+j mod 2. Clearly w is even and w ∈ E0 ∪ E1, so we have w ≡ 2b (mod 2p)
for b ∈ D0 ∪ D1. Then we have b ≡ 2a (mod p).

For p ≡ ±1 (mod 8), in which case 2 is a quadratic residue modulo p
[11], we have b ∈ Di+j mod 2, which leads to w ≡ 2b (mod 2p) ∈ Ei+j mod 2,
i.e., 2Ei+j mod 2 ⊆ Ei+j mod 2. Since 2Ei+j mod 2 and Ei+j mod 2 have the same
cardinality, it follows that vEj = 2Ei+j mod 2 = Ei+j mod 2.

The case of p ≡ ±3 (mod 8) follows in a similar way, in which case 2 is

a quadratic non-residue modulo p.

(III). Let p ≡ ±1 (mod 8), in which case 2 is a quadratic residue modulo
p [11]. Then we can ﬁnd when v runs through D0 (resp. D1), p + 2v modulo

6

2p runs through D0 (resp. D1). Since otherwise, if p + 2v0 (mod 2p) ∈ D1
for some v0 ∈ D1, then we write p + 2v0 ≡ g1+2k0 (mod 2p) for some integer
k0, from which we derive 2v0 ≡ g1+2k0 (mod p). It leads to the result that
2 is a quadratic non-residue modulo p, a contradiction. So, Di = {(v + p)
(mod 2p) : v ∈ Ei} if p ≡ ±1 (mod 8).

The equality Di+1 mod 2 = {(v + p) (mod 2p) : v ∈ Ei} for p ≡ ±3
(mod 8) is proved similarly as the ﬁrst. Here, if v runs through D0 (resp.
D1),then p + 2v modulo 2p runs through D1 (resp. D0).

(IV) Comes from (III).
(V). In fact ﬁrst, the set {u + p : u ∈ D1, u < p} ∪ {u − p : u ∈ D1, u > p}
exactly contains |D1| many even numbers. Second, we suppose that a ∈ E0
for some a ∈ {u + p : u ∈ D1, u < p} ∪ {u − p : u ∈ D1, u > p}. Write
a ≡ 2v (mod 2p) for some v ∈ D0. From the deﬁnition of D0, we see that
v is a quadratic residue modulo p. Then a is a quadratic residue modulo
p due to p ≡ ±1 (mod 8), in which case 2 is a quadratic residue modulo
p [11]. However, a is of the form u + p or u − p for some u ∈ D1, and
a ≡ u (mod p) is a quadratic non-residue modulo p, a contradiction. So
{u + p : u ∈ D1, u < p} ∪ {u − p : u ∈ D1, u > p} ⊆ E1, and both have the
same cardinality.

For i = 0, 1, let

Si(X) = Xu∈Di

X u

and

Ti(X) = Si(X 2) = Xu∈Ei

X u

(mod X 2p − 1).

According to (1), the generating polynomial of (su)u≥0 is

S(X) = 2X p + S1(X) + 2T0(X) + 3T1(X).

(3)

As mentioned before, we will consider the values S(γv) for a unit γ ∈
GR∗(4r, 4) of order 2p and v = 0, 1, . . . , 2p − 1. According to the deﬁni-
tions of D0, D1, E0 and E1, we will describe S(γv) in the following Lemma in
terms of S0(γ) (or S1(γ)) due to the fact that in the ring GR(4r, 4)

S0(γ) + S1(γ) = Xu∈D0∪D1

γu =

Lemma 4. Let γ ∈ GR∗(4r, 4) be of order 2p, and let S(X) be the generating
polynomial of (su)u≥0 described in (3).

(I). If p ≡ ±3 (mod 8), we have

(II). If p ≡ ±1 (mod 8), we have

S(γv) = 

S(γv) = 

2 − 2S0(γ),

2S0(γ),

if v ∈ D0 ∪ D1,
if v ∈ E0,
if v ∈ E1.

Proof. (I). Let p ≡ ±3 (mod 8). By Lemma 3(I) we ﬁrst get

S1(γv) = (cid:26) 1 − S0(γ),

S0(γ),

if v ∈ D0,
if v ∈ D1.

Second, for any v ∈ Ej for j ∈ {0, 1}, write v = 2v for v ∈ Dj. We see that
p + 2v ∈ Dj+1 by Lemma 3(III) and γv = γ2v = −γp+2v, by Lemma 3(I) we
derive

S1(γv) = S1(−γp+2v) = − Xu∈D1

which leads to

γu(p+2v) = 

if v ∈ D0,

if v ∈ D1,

S1(γv) = (cid:26) −S0(γ),

if v ∈ E0,
if v ∈ E1.

Similarly, by Lemma 3(I)-(IV), we have

and

1 − S0(γ),

S0(γ),

if v ∈ D0,
if v ∈ D1,
if v ∈ E0,
if v ∈ E1.

Then putting everything together, we get the ﬁrst assertion.

The second assertion of this lemma can be proved in a similar way.
So in order to determine the values of S(γv), it is suﬃcient to calculate
S0(γ). We need the parameter [i, j] for i, j ∈ {0, 1}, which is the cardinality
of the set (1 + Di) ∩ Ej, i.e.,

[i, j] = |(1 + Di) ∩ Ej|,

where 1 + Di = {1 + u (mod 2p) : u ∈ Di}.

Lemma 5. With notations as before. We have

Proof. Since g used above is also a primitive modulo p, we write

H0 = {g2n

(mod p) : n = 0, 1, . . . , (p − 3)/2}

and

H1 = {g1+2n

(mod p) : n = 0, 1, . . . , (p − 3)/2}.

We ﬁnd that for i = 0, 1

{u (mod p) : u ∈ Di} = Hi

and

{2u (mod p) : u ∈ Di} = Hi+ℓ mod 2,

where ℓ = 0 if p ≡ ±1 (mod 8) and ℓ = 1 if p ≡ ±3 (mod 8), i.e., ℓ = 0 if 2
is a quadratic residue modulo p, and ℓ = 1 otherwise [11]. Therefore,

[i, j] = |(1 + Di) ∩ Ej| = |(1 + Hi) ∩ Hj+ℓ mod 2|.

We conclude the proof by applying the values of |(1 + Hi) ∩ Hj| computed in
[10].

With the values of [0, 0] and [0, 1], we prove the following statement,

which is a generalization of [5, Theorem 1].

Lemma 6. Let γ ∈ GR∗(4r, 4) be of order 2p. Then we have

(S0(γ))2 = S0(γ) +

(p − 1)/4,

Xl,m=0

γg2l+g2m

=

(p−3)/2

Xl,m=0

γg2m(g2(l−m)+1).

For each ﬁxed m, since the order of g modulo 2p is p − 1, we see that l − m
modulo (p − 1) runs through the range 0, 1, . . . , (p − 3)/2 if l does. So we
have

(p−3)/2

(S0(γ))2 =

γg2m(g2n+1).

Xm,n=0

(5)

Since g is odd, we see that g2n + 1 (mod 2p) is even for any n. That is,
g2n + 1 (mod 2p) ∈ E0 ∪ E1 ∪ {0}. So we consider g2n + 1 (mod 2p) in three
diﬀerent cases.
Case 1. Let

N0 = {n : 0 ≤ n ≤ (p − 3)/2, g2n + 1

(mod 2p) ∈ E0}.

In fact, the cardinality |N0| of N0 equals [0, 0]. For each n ∈ N0, as the proof
of Lemma 4 we obtain that by (4)

(p−3)/2

Xm=0

γg2m(g2n+1) = Xv∈D0

γ2v = S0(γ2) = S0(−γp+2)

= (cid:26) −S0(γ),

if p ≡ ±1
if p ≡ ±3

(mod 8),
(mod 8).

Case 2. Similar to Case 1, we let

N1 = {n : 0 ≤ n ≤ (p − 3)/2, g2n + 1

(mod 2p) ∈ E1}.

10

Then the cardinality |N1| equals [0, 1]. Now for each n ∈ N1, we obtain that

(p−3)/2

Xm=0

γg2m(g2n+1) = Xv∈D1

γ2v = S1(γ2) = S1(−γp+2)

= (cid:26) −1 + S0(γ),

−S0(γ),

if p ≡ ±1
if p ≡ ±3

(mod 8),
(mod 8).

Case 3. There is an n such that (g2n + 1) ≡ 0 (mod 2p) if and only if
γg2m(g2n+1) =

p ≡ 1 (mod 4). In this case, we have n = (p−1)/4 and P(p−3)/2

(p − 1)/2.

m=0

Let p ≡ 1 (mod 8). Using (5) we obtain that

(S0(γ))2 = |N0| · (−S0(γ)) + |N1| · (−1 + S0(γ)) + (p − 1)/2.

Then we get the desired result by using the values of[0, 0] (=|N0|) and [0, 1]
(= |N1|) in Lemma 5.

The assertions for p ≡ −1, 3, −3 (mod 8) can be obtained in a similar

way.

With the help of Lemma 6 we now deduce the values of S0(γ).

It is
clear that S0(γ) ∈ GR∗(4r, 4) or S1(γ) ∈ GR∗(4r, 4) from (4). Therefore,
without loss of generality we always suppose that S0(γ) ∈ GR∗(4r, 4). (Of
course, if one supposes that S1(γ) ∈ GR∗(4r, 4), then S1(γ) will be used in
the context.)

Lemma 7. Let γ ∈ GR∗(4r, 4) be of order 2p with S0(γ) = Pu∈D0

GR∗(4r, 4). We have

γu ∈

S0(γ) =

where ρ satisﬁes the equation ρ2 + 3ρ + 3 = 0 over Z4.

Proof Let p ≡ ±1 (mod 16). Then, by Lemma 6, we obtain that (S0(γ))2 =

S0(γ). Under given assumptions about S0(γ), we have S0(γ) = 1. The other
assertions of this lemma can be proved in a similar way.

Lemma 8. Let γ ∈ GR∗(4r, 4) be of order 2p with S0(γ) = Pu∈D0

γu ∈
GR∗(4r, 4), and let S(X) be the generating polynomial of (su)u≥0 described in
(3).
(I). For any odd prime p, we have

S(γv) = (cid:26) p + 1,

(II). If p ≡ ±3 (mod 8), we have

S(γv) ∈ GR∗(4r, 4), for all v ∈ D0 ∪ D1 ∪ E0 ∪ E1,

S(γv) = (cid:26) 0,

Lemmas 4 and 7.

In the following subsections, we will derive linear complexity of (su)u≥0

in (2) by considering the factorization of S(X).

2.2 Linear complexity for the case p ≡ ±3 (mod 8)

Proof. With notations as before. That is, we use S(X) the gener-
ating polynomial of (su)u≥0 and let γ ∈ GR∗(4r, 4) be of order 2p with
γu ∈ GR∗(4r, 4). Suppose that C(X) ∈ Z4[X] is a connec-

tion polynomial of (su)u≥0. We remark that min deg(C(X)) ≤ 2p.

S0(γ) = Pu∈D0

For p ≡ ±3 (mod 8), by (2) and Lemma 8(II) we get

C(γv) = 0 for all v ∈ D0 ∪ D1 ∪ E0 ∪ E1.

Now we consider the values of C(γ0) and C(γp) 5. Let s(X) and c(X) be the
polynomials of degree < 2 such that

S(X) ≡ s(X)

(mod X 2 − 1), C(X) ≡ c(X)

(mod X 2 − 1).

5In fact, C(γ 0) = C(1) and C(γ p) = C(−1).

12

If p ≡ −3 (mod 8), we have S(−1) = S(1) = 2 by Lemma 8(I). It follows

that s(X) = 2 or s(X) = 2X. So by (2) again, we see that

c(X) ∈ {0, 2, 2X, 2X + 2}

and hence either C(−1) = C(1) = 0 or C(−1) = C(1) = 2.

In terms of all values of C(γv) for v = 0, 1, . . . , 2p − 1 above, by Lemma
2(III) we have deg C(X) ≥ 2p. Consequently, we get min deg(C(X)) = 2p
and hence LC((su)u≥0) = 2p for this case.

Similarly if p ≡ 3 (mod 8), we have S(1) = 0 and S(−1) = 2 by Lemma

8(I), and hence s(X) = 1 − X. Then we get

c(X) ∈ {0, 2, X + 1, 2X + 2}

and hence C(−1) = C(1) = 0, or C(−1) = C(1) = 2, or C(−1) = 0 and
C(1) = 2. Then by Lemma 2(III) we have deg C(X) ≥ 2p − 1.

On the other hand, since s(X) = 1 − X, we see that S(X) is divisible by

X − 1 over Z4, from which we derive

S(X) ·

X 2p − 1
X − 1

≡ 0

(mod X 2p − 1).

Then X 2p−1
2p − 1, i.e., LC((su)u≥0) = 2p − 1.

X−1 is a connection polynomial of (su)u≥0. So we get min deg(C(X)) =

2.3 Linear complexity for the case p ≡ ±1 (mod 8)

Due to Lemma 8(III), it is more complicated to determine the connection
polynomial C(X) with the smallest degree when p ≡ ±1 (mod 8). We need
more detailed research on the generating polynomial S(X) of (su)u≥0. For
j = 0, 1, deﬁne

Γj(X) = Yv∈Dj

(X − γv) and Λj(X) = Yv∈Ej
where γ ∈ GR∗(4r, 4) is of order 2p with S0(γ) = Pu∈D0

particular, by Lemma 3(IV) we have for j = 0, 1,

(X − γv),

γu ∈ GR∗(4r, 4). In

Λj(X) = Yv∈Dj

(X − γv+p).

13

Lemma 10. If p ≡ ±1 (mod 8), then Γj(X) and Λj(X) are polynomials
over Z4 for j = 0, 1.

Proof. We only consider Γ0(X) here, for Γ1(X), Λ0(X) and Λ1(X) it can
be done in a similar manner. It is suﬃcient to show that the coeﬃcients of
Γ0(X)

am = (−1)m Xi1<i2<...<im

i1,i2,...,im∈D0

γi1+i2+...+im ∈ Z4

for 1 ≤ m ≤ (p − 1)/2.

Let γb be a term of the last sum and b ≡ i1 + i2 + . . . + im (mod 2p),
b 6≡ 0 (mod p). By Lemma 3 for any n : 0 < n < (p − 1)/2 we have that
g2nij ∈ D0, j = 0, . . . , m. Hence, X − γg2nij , j = 0, . . . , m are the factors in
(X − γv). So, γg2ni1 . . . γg2nim = γg2nb is also a term of this
the product Qv∈Dj

sum for any n = 0, ..., (p − 3)/2, i.e.,

γb + γg2b + · · · + γgp−3b = S0(γb)

is a part of this sum. Therefore, there must exist the elements b1, . . . , bn such
that

n

am = (−1)m

S0(γbi) + A,

Xi=0

where A = |{a|a ≡ (i1 + i2 + . . . + im) ≡ 0 (mod p) and i1 < i2 < . . . <
im; i1, i2, . . . , im ∈ D0}|.

By Lemma 7 and the proof of Lemma 4 we have that S0(γbi) ∈ Z4. This

completes the proof of Lemma 10.

Since γv is a root of X p + 1 for any v ∈ {p} ∪ D0 ∪ D1, and γv1 − γv2 ∈

GR∗(4r, 4) for distinct v1, v2 ∈ {p} ∪ D0 ∪ D1, it follows that

X p + 1 = (X + 1)Γ0(X)Γ1(X),

(6)

from Lemma 2 and the deﬁnitions on Γ0(X) and Γ1(X). Similarly, we have

X p − 1 = (X − 1)Λ0(X)Λ1(X).

(7)

Now, let us explore the expansion of

S(X) = 2X p + S1(X) + 2T0(X) + 3T1(X).

14

Lemma 11. We have the polynomial factoring in the ring Z4[X]

S1(X) + 3T1(X) =

(cid:26)

(X p − 1)Γ0(X)U1(X),

(X p − 1)Γ0(X)U2(X) + 2(X p + 1),

if p ≡ ±1
if p ≡ ±9

(mod 16),
(mod 16),

and

2X p + 2T0(X) =

(cid:26) Γ0(X)Λ0(X)(X − 1)V1(X) + 2(X p + 1),

Γ0(X)Λ0(X)V2(X) + 2(X p + 1),

where Ui(X), Vi(X) ∈ Z4[X], i = 1, 2.

if p ≡ −1, −9
if p ≡ 1, 9

(mod 16),

(mod 16),

Proof. Since p ≡ ±1 (mod 8), by Lemma 3(V) we obtain

where we use γp = −1 and (4). So for v ∈ D0, by Lemma 7 we get

M(γv) = (cid:26) 0,

if p ≡ ±1
if p ≡ ±9

(mod 16),
(mod 16),

from which, and by Lemma 2, we derive

2 + Γ0(X)U2(X),

if p ≡ ±1
if p ≡ ±9

(mod 16),
(mod 16),

15

where U1(X), U2(X) ∈ Z4[X]. We complete the proof of the ﬁrst statement.
Now, we consider the polynomial 2X p + 2T0(X). Since 2X p + 2T0(X) =

2(X p + 1) + 2 + 2T0(X), we only need to consider 2 + 2T0(X).

We ﬁrst consider the roots of 2 + 2S0(X). According to the proof of
Lemma 4, we see that p + 2 ∈ D0 since p ≡ ±1 (mod 8). For any v ∈ E0
with v ≡ 2v (mod 2p), where v ∈ D0, we obtain by (4) and Lemma 7

2 + 2S0(γv) = 2 + 2 Xu∈D0

γuv = 2 + 2 Xu∈D0

γ2vu

= 2 + 2S0(γ2) = 2 + 2S0(−γp+2)
= 2 − 2S0(γ) = 0.

So, by Lemma 2 we have

2 + 2S0(X) = Λ0(X)G(X)

for some G(X) ∈ Z4[X], then we have

2 + 2S0(X 2) = Λ0(X 2)G(X 2).

Since T0(X) = S0(X 2) (mod X 2p − 1) and

(X 2 − γv) = Yu∈D0

(X 2 − γ2u)

Λ0(X 2) = Yv∈E0
= Yu∈D0
= Yu∈D0
= Yu∈D0

(X − γu)(X + γu)

(X − γu)(X − γu+p)

(X − γu) Yv∈D0

(X − γv+p)

= Γ0(X)Λ0(X),

it follows that

2 + 2T0(X) = 2 + 2S0(X 2) = Γ0(X)Λ0(X)G(X 2).

On the other hand, from the fact that

2 + 2T0(1) = p + 1 = (cid:26) 0,

2,

if p ≡ −1
if p ≡ 1

(mod 8),

(mod 8),

16

and Γ0(1)Λ0(1) ∈ GR∗(4r, 4), we write

G(X 2) = (X − 1)V1(X)

for p ≡ −1 (mod 16) or p ≡ −9 (mod 16). Otherwise, we write V2(X) =
G(X 2). Putting everything together, we complete the proof of the second
statement.

Lemma 12. Let S(X) be the generating polynomial of (su)u≥0 described in
(3). We have in the ring Z4[X]

S(X) =




(X − 1)Γ0(X)Γ1(X)W1(X),

Γ0(X)Γ1(X)W2(X),

(X − 1)Γ0(X)Γ1(X)Λ0(X)W3(X),

Γ0(X)Γ1(X)Λ0(X)W4(X),

if p ≡ −1
if p ≡ 1
if p ≡ −9
if p ≡ 9

(mod 16),

(mod 16),

(mod 16),

(mod 16),

where Wi(γv) 6= 0, i = 1, 2 for v ∈ E0 ∪ E1 and Wi(γv) 6= 0, i = 3, 4 for
v ∈ E1.

Proof. Let p ≡ −1 (mod 16). By (6) we have

2(X p + 1) = 2(X + 1)Γ0(X)Γ1(X) = 2(X − 1)Γ0(X)Γ1(X).

Then according to Lemma 11, we write

S(X) = (X − 1)Γ0(X)H(X),

where H(X) = U1(X)(X p − 1)/(X − 1) + Λ0(X)V1(X) + 2Γ1(X). We check
that

= 0,
6= 0,
6= 0,

if v ∈ D1,
if v ∈ E0,
if v ∈ E1.

H(γv)


For v ∈ D1, we have S(γv) = 0 by Lemma 8. Since (γv − 1)Γ0(γv) ∈

GR∗(4r, 4), we have H(γv) = 0 by Lemma 1.

For v ∈ E0, we have ((γv)p − 1)/(γv − 1) = 0 and Λ0(γv) = 0, so that

H(γv) = 2Γ1(γv) 6= 0;

For v ∈ E1, since S(γv) = 2 by Lemma 8, we have H(γv) 6= 0.

So we have by Lemma 1

H(X) = Γ1(X)W1(X)

for some W1(X) ∈ Z4[X] and W1(γv) 6= 0 for v ∈ E0 ∪ E1. Then we get the
factorization of S(X) for p ≡ −1 (mod 16).

Another assertions of this lemma can be proved in a similar way.

17

Theorem 13. Let (su)u≥0 be the quaternary sequence over Z4 deﬁned by (1).
Then the linear complexity of (su)u≥0 satisﬁes

LC((su)u≥0) = (cid:26) p,

p + 1,

if p ≡ −1
if p ≡ 1

(mod 16),

(mod 16).

Proof. Let p ≡ −1 (mod 16). Since S(X) = (X − 1)Γ0(X)Γ1(X)W1(X)
by Lemma 12, together with Lemma 8(I) we have W1(γv) 6= 0 for v ∈ E0 ∪
E1 ∪ {p}. Then we see that

S(X)(X + 1)Λ0(X)Λ1(X) ≡ 0

(mod X 2p − 1).

That is, (X +1)Λ0(X)Λ1(X) is a connection polynomial of degree p of (su)u≥0.
So the minimal degree of connection polynomials of (su)u≥0 is ≤ p.

Let C(X) ∈ Z4[X] be a connection polynomial of (su)u≥0. Due to

gcd((X − 1)Γ0(X)Γ1(X), (X + 1)Λ0(X)Λ1(X)) = 1,

we have

W1(X)C(X) ≡ 0

(mod (X + 1)Λ0(X)Λ1(X))

by (2), (6), (7) and Lemma 12. So we deduce

W1(γv)C(γv) = 0 for v ∈ E0 ∪ E1 ∪ {p}.

Since W1(γv) 6= 0 for v ∈ E0 ∪ E1 ∪ {p}, if W1(γv) ∈ GR∗(4r, 4) then
we get C(γv) = 0, and if W1(γv) = 2η, η ∈ GR∗(4r, 4), then we have either
C(γv) = 0 or C(γv) = 2. I.e., 2C(γv) = 0 for v ∈ E0 ∪ E1 ∪ {p}.

By the deﬁnition of C(X) = 1 + c1X + . . ., i.e., 2C(x) is non-constant,
then by Lemma 1 we have that 2C(x) is divisible by (X + 1)Λ0(X)Λ1(X),
i.e., deg C(X) ≥ p and hence LC((su)u≥0) = p for this case. We prove the
ﬁrst statement.

Let p ≡ 1 (mod 16). From that

S(X)(X 2 − 1)Λ0(X)Λ1(X) ≡ 0

(mod (X 2p − 1)),

we see that (X 2 − 1)Λ0(X)Λ1(X) is a connection polynomial of (su)u≥0 of
degree p + 1.

For any connection polynomial C(X) of (su)u≥0, a similar way presented

above gives

W2(X)C(X) ≡ 0

(mod (X 2 − 1)Λ0(X)Λ1(X)).

18

As in the proof of Theorem 9, denote by s(X) and c(X) the polynomials of
degree < 2 such that

S(X) ≡ s(X)

(mod X 2 − 1), C(X) ≡ c(X)

(mod X 2 − 1).

As earlier, we can obtain that c(X) ∈ {0, 2, 2X, 2X + 2}, hence 2c(X) = 0
and 2C(X) = (X 2 − 1)M(X) for some M(X) ∈ Z4[X]. Since by Lemma 12
W2(γv) 6= 0 for v ∈ E0 ∪ E1, it follows that 2C(γv) = 0 and M(γv) = 0 for
v ∈ E0 ∪ E1. Therefore, M(X) is divisible by Λ0(X)Λ1(X) by Lemma 1, i.e.,
deg C(X) ≥ p + 1 and hence LC((su)u≥0) = p + 1 for this case.

Theorem 14. Let (su)u≥0 be the quaternary sequence deﬁned by (1). Then
the linear complexity of (su)u≥0 satisﬁes

LC((su)u≥0) = (cid:26) (p + 1)/2,

(p + 3)/2,

if p ≡ −9
if p ≡ 9

(mod 16),

(mod 16).

Proof. The proof can follow that of Theorem 13 in a similar way. Here

we give a sketch.

Let p ≡ −9 (mod 16). On the one hand, (X + 1)Λ1(X) is a connection

polynomial of (su)u≥0 of degree (p + 1)/2 by (2).

On the other hand, for any connection polynomial C(X) of (su)u≥0, we

have

W3(X)C(X) ≡ 0

(mod (X + 1)Λ1(X)).

Now since W3(γv) 6= 0 for v ∈ E1 ∪ {p}, it follows that 2C(γv) = 0 for v ∈
∪E1 ∪ {p}. Therefore, by Lemma 2 again 2C(x) is divisible by (X + 1)Λ1(X),
i.e., deg C(X) ≥ (p + 1)/2 and hence LC((su)u≥0) = (p + 1)/2 for this case.
The case of p ≡ 9 (mod 16) follows the way of p ≡ 1 (mod 16) in Theo-

rem 13 and we omit it.

3 Final remarks and conclusions

We determined the exact values of the linear complexity of 2p-periodic qua-
ternary sequences over Z4 deﬁned from the generalized cyclotomic classes
modulo 2p by considering the factorization of the generating polynomial
S(X) in Z4[X].
It is more complicated to study this problem than that
in ﬁnite ﬁelds. Besides the autocorrelation considered in [14], this is another
cryptographic feature of the quaternary cyclotomic sequences of period 2p.

19

A direct computing of the linear complexity has been done for 3 ≤ p ≤
1000 by the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm adapted by Reeds and Sloane in
[16] for the residue class ring to conﬁrm our theorems. Below we list some
experimental data.

1. p = 3, (su)u≥0 = (0, 0, 2, 2, 3, 1), then C(X) = 1+X+X 2+X 3+X 4+X 5

and LC((su)u≥0) = 5(= 2p − 1).

2. p = 5, (su)u≥0 = (0, 0, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 0), then C(X) = 1 + 3X 10 and

LC((su)u≥0) = 10(= 2p).

3. p = 7, (su)u≥0 = (0, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 0, 3, 0, 3, 1), then C(X) = 1 +

X 2 + X 3 + 3X 4 and LC((su)u≥0) = 4(= (p + 1)/2).

4. p = 17, C(X) = 1 + X + 3X 17 + 3X 18, LC((su)u≥0) = 18(= p + 1).
5. p = 31, C(X) = 1 + 3X 31, LC((su)u≥0) = 31(= p).
6. p = 41, C(X) = 1 + 2X 2 + 3X 3 + 2X 5 + 2X 6 + 3X 7 + 3X 8 + 3X 9 +
X 10 + 2X 11 + 3X 12 + X 13 + X 14 + X 15 + 2X 16 + 2X 17 + X 19 + 2X 20 + 3X 22,
LC((su)u≥0) = 22(= (p + 3)/2).

We hope that the procedures in this paper used to derive the linear com-
plexity can be extended to quaternary cyclotomic sequences with larger pe-
riod (for example, 2pn).

We ﬁnally remark that it is interesting to consider the k-error linear

complexity of the sequences in this work.

Appendix

Proof of Lemma 1.

It is a well-known fact that if ξ ∈ GR(4r, 4) is a root of the polyno-
mial P (X) ∈ Z4[X] then P (X) = (X − ξ)Q1(X) for some polynomial
Q1(X) ∈ GR(4r, 4)[X]. Let η be another root of P (X) and ξ−η ∈ GR∗(4r, 4)
then 0 = (ξ − η)Q1(η), i.e.,Q1(η) = 0. So, Q1(X) = (X − η)Q2(X) for some
polynomial Q2(X) ∈ GR(4r, 4)[X] and P (X) = (X − ξ)(X − η)Q2(X).

Proof of Lemma 2.

(I). By the choice of γ we have an expansion (X p−1)/(X −1) = Qp−1

j=1(X −
j=1(1 − γj)(1 + γj) . So, γj − γn ∈ GR∗(4r, 4) when
j, n = 0, ..., 2p − 1 and j 6≡ n (mod p). Therefore, if P (γj) = 0 for all
j ∈ Di or for all j ∈ Ei, i = 0, 1, then by Lemma 1 P (X) is divisible by
(X − γj). The ﬁrst assertion of Lemma 2 is proved.

γ2j), hence p = Qp−1
(X − γj) or Qj∈Ei

Qj∈Di

(II). This assertion follows from (I).
(III). We consider two cases.
Let P (1) = 0 or P (−1) = 0. Suppose P (−1) = 0, in this case by (II) we

have that

P (X) = (X p + 1) P3(X)

and 2P3(X) 6= 0 since P (0) = 1. From the equality P (X) = (X p + 1) P3(X)
for X = γv, v ∈ E0 ∪ E1 we deduce 2P3(γv) = 0, therefore 2P3(X) is divisible
by (X p − 1)/(X − 1) and deg P (X) ≥ 2p − 1. Furthermore, if P (1) = 0 then
2P3(X) is divisible by (X p − 1) and deg P (X) ≥ 2p.

Let P (1) 6= 0 and P (−1) 6= 0. Then, by condition P (1) = 2 and P (−1) =
2 and P (γj) = 0 for all j : j ∈ D0 ∪ D1. By (I) we have that P (X) =
Q(X) (X p + 1) /(X + 1), Q(X) ∈ Z4[X] and 2Q(X) 6= 0. Since P (−1) = 2
it follows that Q(−1) = 2 and Q(X) = (X + 1)F (X) + 2, F (X) ∈ Z4[X] or

P (X) = (X p + 1) F (X) + 2 (X p + 1) /(X + 1).

From the last equality and conditions of this lemma we obtain that 2F (γv) =
0 for v ∈ E0 ∪E1 ∪{0}, therefore 2F (x) is divisible by xp −1 and deg P (X) ≥
2p.

Remark. The polynomial P (X) is not obliged to be divisible by X 2p − 1
when P (γj) = 0 for j = 0, 1, . . . , 2p − 1. For example, P (X) = X 2p − 1 +
2(X p + 1).
