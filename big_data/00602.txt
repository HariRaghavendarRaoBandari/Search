Abstract

We reveal the universality of short-term anisotropic inﬂation. As a demonstration, we study

inﬂation with an exponential type gauge kinetic function which is ubiquitous in models obtained by

dimensional reduction from higher dimensional fundamental theory. It turns out that an anisotropic

inﬂation universally takes place in the later stage of conventional inﬂation. Remarkably, we ﬁnd
that primordial gravitational waves with a peak amplitude around 10−26 ∼ 10−27 are copiously
produced in high-frequency bands 10MHz∼100MHz. If we could detect such gravitational waves

in future, we would be able to probe higher dimensional fundamental theory.

INTRODUCTION

As is often said, cosmology has entered into the precision area. Therefore, we need to

reﬁne predictions of inﬂation up to the percent level and reveal qualitatively new phenomena.

To this aim, we should recall that slight violation of time translation symmetry among de

Sitter symmetry gives rise to a tilt of the power spectrum of curvature perturbations of

the order of a slow roll parameter. The point is that the slow roll parameter characterizes

deviation from the exact de Sitter spacetime.

It is interesting to observe that the non-

gaussianity is also of the order of the slow roll parameter in conventional inﬂation. Thus,

it is legitimate to infer that the symmetry breaking is a key to seek other qualitatively new

phenomena of the order of the slow roll parameter.

Along the above line of thought, it is natural to consider the possibility of violation

of rotational symmetry among the de Sitter symmetry, which must lead to the statistical

anisotropy in primordial ﬂuctuations. In fact, there were observational hints of statistical

anisotropy in the CMB data [1]. Nevertheless, it was not so easy to invent a mechanism to

realize the statical anisotropy in an inﬂationary scenario partially because of psychological

barrier due to the cosmic no-hair conjecture. Indeed, it had been widely believed that an

anisotropy of the universe rapidly decays during inﬂation. This is the so called the cosmic

no-hair conjecture.

Indeed, the cosmic no-hair theorem [2] where homogeneous universe

with a cosmological constant is assumed supported the cosmic no-hair conjecture. This is

because the inﬂaton potential can mimic the cosmological constant. Historically, there have

been challenges to give a counter example to the cosmic no-hair conjecture [3]. However,

these models suﬀer from either instability, a ﬁne tuning problem or a naturalness problem

[4].

Eventually, an anisotropic inﬂationary model was found [5], which can be regarded as

the ﬁrst counter example to the cosmic no-hair conjecture. More precisely, it is shown

that anisotropic inﬂation occurs in the presence of a gauge kinetic function through which

the gauge ﬁeld is coupled to an inﬂaton and gives rise to the statical anisotropy of the

order of a few percent [6]. It should be stressed that anisotropic inﬂation can be naturally

realized in the context of supergravity. After the discovery of anisotropic inﬂation, many

cosmological predictions [6, 7] and further extension to various models [8–10] have been

discussed. Importantly, anisotropic inﬂation can be tested with observations [11, 12].

2

In previous works, it has been assumed that the gauge kinetic function has a speciﬁc

relation to the inﬂaton potential function. Actually, it is not necessary to assume the spe-

ciﬁc functional form for the presence of short-term anisotropic inﬂation. Indeed, short-term

anisotropic inﬂation occurs universally. In this paper, we emphasize this point and study

its phenomenological consequence. As a concrete demonstration, we study inﬂation with

the exponential type gauge kinetic function. As is well known, the exponential function is

ubiquitous from the point of view of dimensional reduction from higher dimensional funda-

mental theory. As to the inﬂaton potential, we consider a monomial potential which can

drive chaotic inﬂation. It turns out that anisotropic inﬂation occurs in the last several e-

folds. In fact, the gauge ﬁeld starts to grow in the last stage of inﬂation. We show that this

universally happens for any monomial potential.

In the conventional inﬂation, primordial gravitational waves are produced from vacuum

quantum ﬂuctuations. In the present model, due to the coupling between the inﬂaton and

the gauge ﬁeld, copious gravitational waves are produced by the classical gauge ﬁeld. Since

the production occurs in the last stage of the inﬂation, the frequency range of gravitational
waves is typically 10MHz∼100MHz. The amplitude of gravitational waves depends on model
parameters. In fact, it is easy to exceed the bound coming from the nucleosynthesis. Hence,

it is important to observationally explore primordial gravitational waves with MHz frequen-

cies from short-term anisotropic inﬂation. Although the current sensitivity of observations is

too low to detect the gravitational waves [13], future detectors [14] may achieve the required

sensitivity. The recent discovery of gravitational waves [15] encourages us to pursue the

study of high frequency gravitational waves.

The paper is organized as follows. In section II, we discuss the universality of short-term

anisotropic inﬂation. As a demonstration, we show that short-term anisotropic inﬂation

occurs even in a model with the monomial inﬂaton potential and the exponential type

gauge kinetic function. We explain how this occurs in the case of chaotic inﬂation in detail.

In section III, we discuss quantization of the gauge ﬁled during anisotropic inﬂation and

derive mode functions for later calculations. In section IV, we calculate the power spectrum

of the gravitational waves induced by the gauge ﬁeld during anisotropic inﬂation. It turns

out that copious gravitational waves can be produced in the MHz frequency range. The

ﬁnal section is devoted to the conclusion.

II. UNIVERSALITY OF SHORT-TERM ANISOTROPIC INFLATION

In this section, ﬁrst we review anisotropic inﬂation [5]. We stress that the universality

of short-term anisotropic inﬂation. Then, we investigate a speciﬁc exponential type gauge

kinetic function to reveal universality of short-term anisotropic inﬂation.

We consider an action

where Mp represents the reduced plank mass, g is the determinant of the metric gµν and

R is the Ricci scalar. Here, we introduced a gauge ﬁeld Aµ with the ﬁeld strength Fµν =
∂µAν − ∂νAµ and the gauge ﬁeld is coupled to an inﬂaton φ through a gauge kinetic function
f (φ). For the moment, we do not specify a potential function for the inﬂaton V (φ).

Let us discuss the cosmological homogeneous dynamics. The homogeneity imposes φ =

φ(t). For the gauge ﬁeld, we can take an ansatz Aµ = (0, vA(t), 0, 0) without loss of generality.

In the presence of the non-trivial gauge ﬁeld, we can not take isotropic ansatz for the metric.

Instead, we take the anisotropic ansatz

ds2 = −dt2 + e2α(t)(cid:2)e−4σ(t)dx2 + e2σ(t)(dy2 + dz2)(cid:3) .

(2)

Now, we can derive equations of motion. It is easy to solve the equation for the gauge ﬁeld

as

˙vA = pAf−2

where pA is an integration constant. Thus, the ﬁeld equation for the inﬂaton reads

From the Einstein equation, we obtain the hamiltonian constraint

To understand how anisotropic inﬂation occurs, it is convenient to express the gauge

kinetic function in terms of the scale factor a(t) as

f (φ) ∝ a−n(t) = e−nα .

(8)

From Eq.(5), one can see that the energy density of the gauge ﬁeld grows if n > 2 .

It

decays for n < 2. In the case of n = 2, it is almost constant. Note that σ is always negligible

compared with α. In the regime where the inﬂaton slow rolls and the back reaction from

the gauge ﬁeld is negligible, Eqs.(4) and (5) can be reduced to

These equations lead to

(13)

Although the expression (13) is useful for discussing concrete models of anisotropic inﬂation,

it is too restrictive.

In fact, it requires the gauge ﬁeld is always active during inﬂation.

However, it is interesting to consider the possibility that the gauge ﬁeld becomes relevant

for a certain period during inﬂation. Actually, as stressed in [11], the condition for the

occurrence of anisotropic inﬂation reads

M 2
pl

> 2 .

(14)

This condition determines the region where short-term anisotropic inﬂation occurs. In the

extreme case (13), the gauge ﬁeld is sustained in the whole period of inﬂation.

From now on, as a concrete demonstration, we consider the gauge kinetic function

f (φ) = e

c

Mpl

φ

,

(15)

where c is a coupling constant.

It should be noted that such an exponential type gauge

kinetic function is ubiquitous in models obtained by dimensional reduction from higher

5

dimensional fundamental theory such as superstring theory. Apparently, from the criterion

(13), anisotropic inﬂation does not happen. In fact, however, for a certain constant c, the

gauge ﬁeld can grow. We will show it explicitly. For the gauge ﬁeld to grow, the decreasing

rate of the gauge kinetic function must be larger than that of (13) with n = 2. Note that

Eq.(13) is a decreasing function. When we choose the functional form (15), this condition

is given by

(16)

Of course, this does not hold in general. Rather, it constrains the region where anisotropic

inﬂation is possible. Indeed, we have the condition

c >

2
Mpl

V
V,φ

,

(17)

where we used the fact that the derivative of the inﬂaton with respect to time is negative.

Notice that this is nothing but the condition (14). If the inequality (17) is satisﬁed, the

gauge ﬁeld grows. To be more precise, let us consider a monomial potential

V (φ) ∝ φl ,

where l is a real parameter. Then it becomes

c >

2
l

φ
Mpl

.

(18)

(19)

Thus, in the region where the condition (19) is satisﬁed, we can realize anisotropic inﬂation.
For example, for the potential (18), the inﬂaton takes the value φ ∼ O (10Mpl) around
CMB scales provided the number of e-foldings 50 ∼ 60, and the inﬂation ends around
φ ∼ O (1Mpl). Hence, if c > O(1) we can see the growth of the gauge ﬁeld in the late stage
of inﬂation.

In Eq.(8), we assumed constancy of n. Then, we obtained the functional form (13). Since

we took the gauge coupling function (15) diﬀerent from the function (13), n should be time

dependent. Let us try to express the gauge kinetic function (15) in the form (8) with the

time dependent n(t):

c

φ ∝ a−n(t) = e−n(t)HI t ,

where HI is the Hubble constant during inﬂation. This gives rise to the following relation

.

(21)

Here, we assume the ﬁrst term of the right-hand side of Eq.(21) is negligible compared with
the second term in a time scale of expansion H−1

If the slow roll condition is satisﬁed, it is much smaller than 1. Therefore we can treat n(t)

as an almost constant quantity during slow roll inﬂation.

inﬂaton φ0 = 13Mpl , and c = 9. In Fig.1, we plotted the evolution of the inﬂaton. We can

see a transition around at α = 38. From Fig.2, taking a look at the green dotted arrow,

one can ﬁnd that the gauge ﬁeld start to grow at around α = 22 and eventually enter into

the attractor around at α = 38. From Fig.1, the number of e-folds α = 22 corresponds to

φ = 9Mpl. This is a consequence of the inequality (19). This growth of the gauge ﬁeld made
the transition of the inﬂation to the second inﬂationary phase around at α (cid:39) 38 . In the

(32)

We note that Eq.(29) holds during the attractor. Considering the eﬀective potential of

the inﬂaton ﬁeld, it turns out that the attractor like behavior means the inﬂaton falls the

trough of the eﬀective potential. Numerical result Fig.3 tells us that the inﬂaton moves

with the trough. In the second inﬂationary phase, the rolling of the inﬂaton is governed

by the eﬀective potential corrected by the gauge ﬁeld, so that the velocity of the inﬂaton

decreases gradually. This result is diﬀerent from that of conventional anisotropic inﬂation

with the gauge kinetic function (13) [5]. From the view of Eq.(20), we can understand that

the diﬀerence comes from the growth of the power n.

In the above example, we took c = 9. In this case, at some point the gauge ﬁeld starts to

grow and continues to grow for about 15 e-folds, and enter into the attractor phase of short-

term anisotropic inﬂation which persists about 20 e-folds. For a more moderate parameter

c, the duration of short-term anisotropic inﬂation becomes more short. In the extreme case,

there would be no attractor phase and the period where the gauge ﬁeld is relevant would be

about 4 e-folds. It is the case that we are focusing on in the rest of this paper.

III. QUANTUM GAUGE FIELD DURING ANISOTROPIC INFLATION

In this section, we derive the mode function of the gauge ﬁeld which will be used for

calculations of gravitational waves in the next section.

Neglecting the back reaction from the gauge ﬁeld, we consider the isotropic inﬂationary

background

ds2 = a(τ )2(cid:2)−dτ 2 + dx2 + dy2 + dz2(cid:3) ,

where τ is the conformal time. One can expand the gauge ﬁeld in Fourier space as

In this section, we consider short-term anisotropic inﬂation with c ∼ 3 for which typically
there is no an attractor phase. We show that copious gravitational waves can be produced

by the gauge ﬁeld during the phase approaching the attractor. The analysis is quite similar

to that used in a diﬀerent context [16].

Since we consider the situation where the gauge ﬁeld is negligible in background equations,

the energy momentum tensor, namely the nonlinear part, of the gauge ﬁeld becomes the

source of gravitational waves. One can get the tensor sector of the action (1) as

To calculate the integration (78), we must know the function ν(z(cid:48)). Taking a look at Eq.(59),
we see an explicit form of the inﬂaton potential V (φ) is necessary. Here, we consider a
monomial inﬂaton potential, namely V (φ) ∝ φl. Then we obtain

z ≡ −kτ = e−(Ne−Nk) ,

(82)

where N corresponds to the variable z(cid:48). Since α = N − Nin , we get

α = − ln(z(cid:48)) − ln(qin) .

Similarly, we have the relation

Ntot ≡ Ne − Nin = − ln(z) − ln(qin) .

FIG. 5.

In the case of l = 2, the spectrum of gravitational waves are depicted. The red peak

respectively.

17

We are now in a position to calculate the integral (78) for several values of l and c. The
results are shown in Figs.5∼7, where we took the Hubble constant to be HI = 10−5Mpl . In
Figs.5∼7, the spectrum of the energy density parameter h2
0ΩGW of gravitational waves are
depicted against the frequency of gravitational waves. The yellow line represents conven-

tional vacuum tensor ﬂuctuations constrained by CMB observations. The green dotted line

is an upper bound to the primordial gravitational waves from big-bang nucleosynthesis. In

the case of l = 4, 6 (Figs.6,7), we have assumed that the inﬂaton potential on CMB scales

is diﬀerent from that near the end of inﬂation. It is assumed that they are connected with

each other smoothly. From the results, we see that gravitational waves can be copiously

produced by the gauge ﬁeld in the ecφ/MplF F model.

FIG. 6.

In the case of l = 4, the spectrum of gravitational waves are depicted. The red peak

represents the case of c = 3.1, the blue and green one correspond to c = 3 and c = 2.9 respectively.

There exists a peak in the spectrum of the density parameter because the scales which

have exited the horizon earlier are more enhanced than the one exited later. Note that the

amplitude can exceed the bound of the nucleosynthesis depending on the parameters. As

can be seen, gravitational waves can be produced for a short period. It is because that ν

of Eq.(79) grows in the late stage of inﬂation and it aﬀects the integral (78) signiﬁcantly.
As to observations, several works to detect the gravitational waves in MHz∼GHz frequency
bands have been carried out [17]. The current sensitivity for the amplitude of gravitational

waves at the frequency 100MHz is hc ∼ 10−13 [13], where the characteristic strain is deﬁned
. On the other hand, our model can reach 10−26 ∼ 10−27 in the frequency
bands 10MHz∼100MHz. Although the current sensitivity is too low to detect the signal,
recently new methods are suggested and under development [14]. Since scalar ﬂuctuations

are also produced by the same mechanism, one may worry about primordial black holes.

However, primordial black holes with mass range produced at the end of inﬂation have no

severe constraints because they evaporate well before the big-bang nucleosynthesis.

FIG. 7.

In the case of l = 6, the spectrum of gravitational waves are depicted. The red peak

represents the case of c = 2.9, the blue and green one correspond to c = 2.8 and c = 2.7 respectively.

V. CONCLUSION

We claimed short-term anisotropic inﬂation is universal in the sense that it appears in

models with a broad class of potential and gauge kinetic functions. As a concrete demonstra-

tion, we studied anisotropic inﬂation with an exponential type gauge kinetic function (15)

which is ubiquitous in fundamental theory. For example, it is obtained by dimensional re-

duction from higher dimensional fundamental theory. In the ecφ/MplF F model, it turned out

that the gauge ﬁeld starts to grow in the late stage of inﬂation and consequently anisotropic
inﬂation commences for a generic parameter c ∼ O(1).

Remarkably, short-term anisotropic inﬂation provides an interesting phenomenology. In-

19

deed, we have shown that the gauge ﬁeld during short-term anisotropic inﬂation produces
copious gravitational waves in the frequency band 10MHz ∼ 100MHz. The amplitude of
the gravitational waves can reach about 10−26 ∼ 10−27. Such gravitational waves could be
detectable in near future [14] and it enable us to probe fundamental theory. We note that

our model is quite diﬀerent from other models which predict the existence of high-frequency

primordial gravitational waves [18] in that the spectrum of our model has a peak and a

red-tilt rather than a blue-tilt.

There are several applications to be considered. It is interesting to investigate the creation

of cosmological magnetic ﬁelds in the present model. Since the gauge ﬁeld begins to grow

in the last stage of inﬂation, we may have a diﬀerent scenario for primordial magnetic ﬁelds

[9]. It is also possible to extend the present model to non-abelian cases [10] or other inﬂaton

potentials.
