AFFINE MULTIPLE YIELD CURVE MODELS

CHRISTA CUCHIERO, CLAUDIO FONTANA, AND ALESSANDRO GNOATTO

Abstract. We propose a ﬂexible and tractable approach based on aﬃne processes to model multiple
yield curves. More precisely, we model a num´eraire process and multiplicative spreads between Libor
rates and simply compounded OIS rates as functions of an underlying aﬃne process. Besides allowing
for ordered spreads and an exact ﬁt to the initially observed term structures, this general framework
leads to tractable valuation formulas for caplets and swaptions and embeds most of the existing multi-
curve models based on aﬃne processes. In particular, in the case of a model driven by a Wishart process,
we derive a closed-form pricing formula for caplets. The empirical performance of some speciﬁcations
of our framework is illustrated by calibration to market data.

1. Introduction

Starting from the 2007 crisis, one of the most striking features of today’s ﬁnancial environment
is represented by the segmentation of interest rate markets. More speciﬁcally, while the pre-crisis
interest rate market was well described by a single yield curve and interbank (Libor/Euribor) rates
associated to diﬀerent tenors were simply determined by no-arbitrage relations, nowadays the market is
segmented in the sense that distinct yield curves are constructed from market instruments that depend
on a speciﬁc tenor, thus giving rise to multiple yield curves. The credit and liquidity risks existing
in the interbank market, which were perceived as negligible before the crisis, are at the origin of this
phenomenon. This is also reﬂected by the emergence of spreads between OIS rates and interbank rates
as well as between interbank rates associated to diﬀerent tenors.

In this paper, we propose a general and ﬂexible approach to model multiple yield curves, based
on aﬃne processes. More speciﬁcally, inspired by our previous work [13], we choose to model mul-
tiplicative spreads between (normalized) spot Libor rates and (normalized) simply compounded OIS
rates. Besides being directly observable from market quotes, multiplicative spreads represent a conve-
nient modeling quantity and admit a natural interpretation in terms of forward exchange premia. We
consider a general interest rate market where OIS zero-coupon bonds and FRA contracts are traded,
for a ﬁnite set of tenors and for all maturities, and assume the existence of an abstract num´eraire -
martingale measure couple, thus ensuring absence of arbitrage in a sense precisely speciﬁed below. We
then model the logarithm of the multiplicative spreads and of the num´eraire process as aﬃne functions
of an underlying aﬃne process. In the special case where the num´eraire process is chosen as the OIS
bank account, our framework can be regarded as the natural extension of classical aﬃne short rate
models to the multi-curve setting.

The proposed framework fully exploits the analytical tractability of aﬃne processes and exhibits

several desirable modeling features. Indeed, besides its generality, it allows for

• an automatic ﬁt to the initially observed term structures of OIS bond prices and spreads;
• a transparent characterization of order relations between spreads associated to diﬀerent tenors;
• eﬃcient valuation formulae for caplets and swaptions in a multi-curve setting.

The driving aﬃne process is allowed to take values in a general convex state space. In particular,
we analyze a speciﬁcation based on Wishart processes and we derive a novel closed-form formula for
the price of a caplet, expressed in terms of the distribution function of weighted sums of independent
non-central chi-square-distributed random variables. Beyond that, we test the empirical performance
of two simple speciﬁcations of our setup and show that they achieve a satisfactory ﬁt to market data.
Referring to the introductory section of [13] as well as to the book [26] for a more detailed overview
of the relevant literature, we mention here that aﬃne processes have been used to model multiple
yield curves in [18, 23, 24, 35, 36, 39] by adopting a short rate approach and, more recently, in [25]
by extending the aﬃne Libor model originally introduced in [33]. The ﬂexibility of our approach
is highlighted by the fact that, to the best of our knowledge, all of the existing aﬃne multi-curve
models can be recovered as special cases of our framework. Finally, the present paper also provides
a broad class of tractable speciﬁcations of the general framework introduced in [13], where an HJM
approach has been proposed for the arbitrage-free modeling of the term structures of OIS bonds and
multiplicative spreads.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 starts by introducing the main market rates and
multiplicative spreads and then presents an abstract approach to the arbitrage-free modeling of a
general multi-curve interest rate market. In Section 3, we introduce a general framework driven by
aﬃne processes and discuss a possible speciﬁcation based on a short rate approach. Moreover, we also
relate our setup to several aﬃne multi-curve models recently proposed in the literature. In Section 4,
we derive general semi-closed valuation formulae for caplets and an approximation for the price of a
swaption. Section 5 contains a detailed analysis of a tractable speciﬁcation based on Wishart processes,
deriving an analytical pricing formula for caplets. Section 6 presents calibration results to market data
for two speciﬁcations of the framework. Finally, Appendix A presents general pricing formulae for
typical interest rate derivatives in terms of the quantities used in our framework and Appendix B
contains the proof of Proposition 2.4.

2. Modeling the post-crisis interest rate market

2.1. Libor rates, OIS rates and spot multiplicative spreads. The underlying quantities of most
interest rate products are represented by Libor (or Euribor) rates. We denote by Lt(t, t + δ) the Libor
rate prevailing at date t for the time interval [t, t + δ], where the tenor δ > 0 is typically one day (1D),
one week (1W) or several months (1M, 2M, 3M, 6M or 12M). In the post-crisis ﬁxed income market,
Libor rates associated to diﬀerent tenors started to exhibit distinct behaviors, leading for instance to
non-negligible basis spreads (see Appendix A.1). In this paper, we shall consider Libor rates for a
ﬁnite set of tenors {δ1, . . . , δm}, with δ1 < . . . < δm, for some m ∈ N.

The reference rates for overnight borrowing (i.e., for the shortest tenor of 1D) correspond to the
Eonia (Euro overnight index average) rate in the Eurozone and to the Federal Funds rate in the US
market. Overnight rates represent the underlying of overnight indexed swaps (OIS), whose market
swap rates are referred to as OIS rates (see Appendix A.1), typically considered as the best proxy
for risk-free rates in market practice. By bootstrapping techniques (see, e.g., [2]), OIS rates allow to
recover the OIS term structure T (cid:55)→ B(t, T ), where B(t, T ) denotes the price at date t of an OIS
zero-coupon bond with maturity T . We deﬁne the simply compounded (risk-free) OIS spot rate by

Our main modeling quantities are the following spot multiplicative spreads:

Sδi(t, t) :=

1 + δiLt(t, t + δi)
1 + δiLOIS
(t, t + δi)

t

,

for i = 1, . . . , m,

corresponding to multiplicative spreads between (normalized) Libor rates and (normalized) simply
compounded OIS spot rates. Note that the multiplicative spreads Sδi(t, t) are directly observable
on the basis of the OIS and Libor rates quoted on the market. Moreover, in the post-crisis market
environment, the quantities Sδi(t, t) are usually greater than one and increasing with respect to the
tenor’s length δi. Neglecting liquidity issues, this is related to the fact that Libor rates embed the
risk that the average credit quality of the banks included in the Libor panel deteriorates over the
term of the loan, while OIS rates reﬂect the average credit quality of a newly refreshed Libor panel
(see, e.g., [18]). As will be shown below, a key feature of our modeling framework is the facility of
generating multiplicative spreads satisfying such requirements.

Besides representing a convenient modeling quantity, multiplicative spreads also admit a natural
economic interpretation in a multiple curve setting. Referring to [13, Appendix B] for full details,
Libor rates can be associated with artiﬁcial risky bond prices Bδi(t, T ), so that 1 + δiLt(t, t + δi) =
1/Bδi(t, t + δi), for i = 1, . . . , m. If risky bonds are interpreted as bonds of a foreign economy, with
Bδi(t, T ) representing the price (in units of the foreign currency) of a foreign zero-coupon bond, and
OIS bonds are interpreted as domestic bonds, then the quantity Sδi(t, t) corresponds to the forward
exchange premium between the domestic and the foreign economy over the period [t, t + δi]. In this
sense, the multiplicative spread Sδi(t, t) can be regarded as a market expectation (at date t) of the
riskiness of the Libor panel over the period [t, t + δi]. Related foreign exchange analogies have been
proposed in [3] and [40].

2.2. Basic traded assets and fundamental properties. Let us now make precise the ﬁnancial
market considered in this paper. Among all ﬁnancial contracts written on Libor rates, forward rate
agreements (FRA) can be rightfully considered as the basic building blocks, due to the simplicity of
their payoﬀ and to the fact that all linear interest rate derivatives (such as interest rate swaps and basis
swaps) can be represented as portfolios of FRAs. Motivated by this observation, we shall consider a
general ﬁnancial market consisting of the following basic traded assets, with T < +∞ denoting a ﬁxed
time horizon:

(i) OIS zero-coupon bonds for all maturities T ∈ [0, T];
(ii) FRA contracts for all maturities T ∈ [0, T] and for all tenors {δ1, . . . , δm}.

Note that, diﬀerently from the pre-crisis single-curve setting, FRA contracts have to be considered
on top of OIS bonds since they cannot be perfectly replicated by the latter any longer, due to the
discrepancy between Libor rates Lt(t, t + δi) and simply compounded OIS rates LOIS
(t, t + δi). We
denote by ΠF RA(t; T, T + δi, K) the price at date t of a FRA contract starting at date T with maturity
T +δi, rate K > 0 and unitary notional, for 0 ≤ t ≤ T ≤ T and i = 1, . . . , m. We denote by Lt(T, T +δi)
the corresponding fair FRA rate, i.e., the rate K ﬁxed at date t satisfying ΠF RA(t; T, T + δi, K) = 0.
We say that a FRA contract written at t is fair if its rate K is set equal to Lt(T, T + δi), i.e., if
the price of the FRA contract at the inception date t is zero. Extending deﬁnition (2.1) of the spot
multiplicative spread, we deﬁne (forward) multiplicative spreads Sδi(t, T ), for 0 ≤ t ≤ T ≤ T and
i = 1, . . . , m, by

CHRISTA CUCHIERO, CLAUDIO FONTANA, AND ALESSANDRO GNOATTO

Multiplicative spreads of the form (2.2) have been ﬁrst introduced in [27] and further considered as
modeling quantities in [13] (see also [40]). We refer to [13, Appendix B] for the interpretation of the
forward multiplicative spread Sδi(t, T ) in terms of the foreign exchange analogy introduced at the end
of Section 2.1.

A ﬁrst and fundamental issue is the absence of arbitrage in the ﬁnancial market composed by the
basic traded assets introduced above. To this end, we let (Ω,F) be a measurable space endowed with
a ﬁltration (Ft)0≤t≤T and formulate the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 2.1. Let Q be a probability measure on (Ω,F) and B = (Bt)0≤t≤T a strictly positive (Ft)-
adapted process such that B0 = 1. We say that (B, Q) is a num´eraire - martingale measure couple if
the B-discounted price of every basic traded asset is a martingale on (Ω, (Ft)0≤t≤T, Q).

In other words, if (B, Q) is a num´eraire - martingale measure couple, the price of every OIS zero-
coupon bond and FRA contract is a Q-martingale when discounted with respect to the num´eraire
process B. Deﬁnition 2.1 is in the spirit of [16], where the authors consider term structure models
generated by a num´eraire - martingale measure couple in the above sense. Note that we do not
assume that B is a traded asset and it can thus be interpreted as a state-price density process when
Q corresponds to the physical probability measure (see, e.g., [19, 43]).

In the present paper, we shall work under the following standing assumption.
Assumption 2.2. There exists a num´eraire - martingale measure couple (B, Q).

In particular, Assumption 2.2 suﬃces to exclude the existence of arbitrage proﬁts, in the sense of
no asymptotic free lunch with vanishing risk (see [14]), in the large ﬁnancial market composed by all
basic traded assets, i.e., by all OIS zero-coupon bonds and FRA contracts.

Remark 2.3 (OIS bank account as num´eraire). In the literature on multiple curves, the num´eraire is
typically chosen to be the OIS bank account and Q is the corresponding (spot) martingale measure.
While this choice of (B, Q) will be considered in detail in Section 3.3, we want to point out that
our framework is not limited to this speciﬁcation and allows to consider several alternative settings,
depending on the choice of the num´eraire - martingale measure couple (see Section 3.2 below). For
the moment, we just think of (B, Q) in abstract and general terms.

Assumption 2.2 implies that the arbitrage-free price of every basic traded asset can be computed
by taking the conditional Q-expectation of its B-discounted payoﬀ, similarly as in the classical risk-
neutral valuation paradigm1. Throughout the paper, unless explicitly indicated, expectations are
taken under the measure Q, while the measure QT denotes the T -forward measure with density
dQT /dQ = 1/(BT B(0, T )), for T ∈ [0, T]. We can now state the following proposition, which is a
simple consequence of Deﬁnition 2.1 (for completeness, the proof is given in Appendix B).

Proposition 2.4. Suppose that Assumption 2.2 holds. Then the following hold:

(i) OIS zero-coupon bond prices satisfy

B(t, T ) = E

for all 0 ≤ t ≤ T ≤ T;

1In the typical situation where B is the OIS bank account and Q the corresponding martingale measure, as considered
in Remark 2.3, computing the price of a derivative by taking the conditional Q-expectation of its B-discounted payoﬀ
corresponds to computing its clean-price, i.e., neglecting counterparty risk and assuming a funding rate equal to the OIS
rate (compare also with the discussion in [13, Appendix A]).

(ii) for every i = 1, . . . , m, the fair FRA rate satisﬁes
Lt(T, T + δi) = EQT +δi [LT (T, T + δi)|Ft],

(2.4)

for all 0 ≤ t ≤ T ≤ T;

(2.5)

Sδi(t, T ) = EQT

[Sδi(T, T )|Ft],

for all 0 ≤ t ≤ T ≤ T.

From the modeling perspective, Proposition 2.4 together with representation (2.2) implies that, in
order to give an arbitrage-free description of the ﬁnancial market composed by all OIS zero-coupon
bonds and FRA contracts, it suﬃces to model the num´eraire process B together with the spot multi-
plicative spreads {(Sδi(t, t))0≤t≤T, i = 1, . . . , m}, under some reference measure Q. In the next section,
this will be achieved in a ﬂexible and tractable way by letting the num´eraire process and the spot
multiplicative spreads be driven by a common underlying aﬃne process.

3. Multi-curve models based on affine processes

In this section we present a general framework based on aﬃne processes for modeling multiple curves.
We ﬁrst recall in Section 3.1 some general results on aﬃne processes, mainly relying on [12, 15, 32].
In Section 3.2, we provide the general deﬁnition of an aﬃne multi-curve model with respect to an
abstract num´eraire-martingale measure couple and derive its fundamental properties. This general
setup is then specialized in Section 3.3 in the typical setting where the num´eraire is given by the
OIS bank account modeled via a short rate. Section 3.4 shows how our setup relates to the existing
multi-curve models driven by aﬃne processes.

3.1. Preliminaries on aﬃne processes. Let V be a ﬁnite-dimensional real vector space with asso-
ciated scalar product (cid:104)·,·(cid:105). We denote by D a non-empty closed convex subset of V , which will serve
as state space for the stochastic process to be introduced below, endowed with the Borel σ-algebra
BD. Typical choices for the state space are represented by D ∈ {Rd, Rd
+} or combinations thereof,
for some d ∈ N, where Sd
On a ﬁltered probability space (Ω,F, (Ft)0≤t≤T, Q) satisfying the usual conditions, we introduce a
stochastic process X = (Xt)0≤t≤T, starting from an initial value X0 = x belonging to the interior of
D. The process X is assumed to be an adapted, time-homogeneous and conservative Markov process
taking values in D and we denote by {pt : D × BD → [0, 1]; t ∈ [0, T]} the family of its transition
kernels. To the process X we associate the sets

Deﬁnition 3.1. The Markov process X = (Xt)0≤t≤T is said to be aﬃne if

(i) it is stochastically continuous, i.e., the transition kernels satisfy lims→t ps(x,·) = pt(x,·)

weakly on D, for every (t, x) ∈ [0, T] × D;

(ii) its Fourier-Laplace transform has exponential aﬃne dependence on the initial state, i.e., there
exist functions φ : D → C and ψ : D → V + iV such that, for every initial value x ∈ D and
for every (t, u) ∈ D, it holds that

Remark 3.2.

(i) Deﬁnition 3.1 slightly diﬀers from the usual deﬁnition of aﬃne process where
the exponential aﬃne form (3.2) is only assumed to hold on the set of bounded exponentials.
The question of when the usual deﬁnition can be extended to our deﬁnition is treated in [32].
In particular, in view of [32, Lemma 4.2], it holds that

UT =(cid:8)ζ ∈ V + iV : E(cid:2)e(cid:104)ζ,XT (cid:105)(cid:3) < +∞(cid:9),

for all T ∈ [0, T].

(ii) At the expense of greater technicalities, our setup can be extended to aﬃne processes taking
values in general (i.e., possibly non-convex) state spaces. However, the class of aﬃne processes
considered in Deﬁnition 3.1 is suﬃciently rich to cover any aﬃne multi-curve model of practical
interest.

The aﬃne property (3.2) together with the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation implies that the func-
tions φ and ψ enjoy the semiﬂow property, i.e., for every u ∈ U and t, s ∈ [0, T] with s + t ≤ T, it holds
that

φ(t + s, u) = φ(t, u) + φ(cid:0)s, ψ(t, u)(cid:1),
ψ(t + s, u) = ψ(cid:0)s, ψ(t, u)(cid:1).

(3.3)

The stochastic continuity of the aﬃne process X also implies its regularity, according to [15, Theorem
+ × Rd−n, for some n ∈ {0, 1, . . . , d}, and [12,
7] (see also [34, Theorem 4.3] in the case D = Rn
Proposition 3.4] in the case D = Sd

+), in the sense that the derivatives

(3.4)

F (u) :=

∂φ(t, u)

∂t

exist and are continuous at u = 0. Regularity implies that it is possible to diﬀerentiate the semiﬂow
relations (3.3) with respect to t and evaluate them at t = 0, thus obtaining the following system of
generalized Riccati ODEs

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=0+

∂ψ(t, u)

∂t

and R(u) :=

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=0+
= F(cid:0)ψ(t, u)(cid:1), φ(0, u) = 0;
= R(cid:0)ψ(t, u)(cid:1), ψ(0, u) = u ∈ U.

∂φ(t, u)

∂t

∂ψ(t, u)

∂t

We report the following result (see [31, Theorem 4.10]), which will be useful for some speciﬁcations
of our setup. We refer to [29] for the notion of diﬀerential characteristics of an aﬃne process and we
denote by V 1 and V 2 two real vector spaces.

Lemma 3.3. Let X = (X 1, X 2) be an aﬃne process taking values in a state space of the form
D = D1 × D2 ⊆ V 1 × V 2, with initial value X0 = (x1, x2) and such that the diﬀerential characteristics
of X 2 only depend on X 1. Then there exist functions ˜φ : D → C and ˜ψ : D → V 1 + iV 1 such that, for
every (t, u1, u2) ∈ D, it holds that
e(cid:104)u1,X 1

˜φ(t,u1,u2)+(cid:104) ˜ψ(t,u1,u2),x1(cid:105)+(cid:104)u2,x2(cid:105).

E(cid:104)

t (cid:105)+(cid:104)u2,X 2

= e

Typical examples where aﬃne processes satisfying the assumptions of Lemma 3.3 are employed are
short rate models (see Section 3.3) and aﬃne stochastic volatility models (see, e.g., [11, Chapter 5]).

3.2. Deﬁnition and general properties of aﬃne multi-curve models. As explained in Sec-
tion 2.2, our general setup assumes the existence of a num´eraire-martingale measure couple (B, Q),
meaning that the B-discounted price of every traded asset is a Q-martingale. Recall also that we
consider as basic traded assets the OIS zero-coupon bonds and the FRA contracts, for all maturities
T ∈ [0, T] and for a ﬁnite set of tenors {δ1, . . . , δm}, with δ1 < . . . < δm, for m ∈ N.

AFFINE MULTIPLE YIELD CURVE MODELS

7

Letting X = (Xt)0≤t≤T be an aﬃne process taking values in a state space D ⊆ V under a measure

Q, we are now in a position to give the general deﬁnition of an aﬃne multi-curve model.
Deﬁnition 3.4. Let u = (u0, u1, . . . , um) be a family of functions ui : [0, T] → V , i = 0, 1, . . . , m, such
that u0(t) ∈ Ut and ui(t) + u0(t) ∈ Ut, for every i = 1, . . . , m and t ∈ [0, T], and v = (v0, v1, . . . , vm)
a family of functions vi : [0, T] → R, i = 0, 1, . . . , m. We say that the triplet (X, u, v) is an aﬃne
multi-curve model if

(i) the logarithm of the num´eraire process Bt satisﬁes

(3.5)

log Bt = −v0(t) − (cid:104)u0(t), Xt(cid:105),

for all t ∈ [0, T];

(ii) the logarithm of the spot multiplicative spreads {Sδi(t, t); i = 1, . . . , m} satisﬁes
for all t ∈ [0, T] and i = 1, . . . , m.

log Sδi(t, t) = vi(t) + (cid:104)ui(t), Xt(cid:105),

(3.6)

Depending on the choice of the num´eraire-martingale measure couple (B, Q) and of the triplet
(X, u, v), diﬀerent modeling approaches can be obtained from the present general setup. For instance:
• if the num´eraire asset B is chosen to be the OIS bank account, Q is the corresponding (spot)
martingale measure and B is modeled via an OIS short rate r = (rt)0≤t≤T, then Deﬁnition 3.4
embeds a classical aﬃne framework for modeling the OIS short rate and the multiplicative
spreads. This speciﬁcation will be analyzed in detail in Section 3.3 (compare also with Section
3.4.1);

• if the OIS zero-coupon bond with maturity T is chosen as num´eraire and Q is the T-forward
measure, then Deﬁnition 3.4 yields an extension of the aﬃne Libor model with multiple curves
recently introduced in [25] (see Section 3.4.2);

• if Q is the physical probability measure and B is chosen as the growth-optimal portfolio (in
the spirit of the benchmark approach to interest rate modeling, see, e.g., [5, 42] and, for a
general account of the benchmark approach, [41]) or, more generally, as a state-price density
(as recently considered in the rational multi-curve models [10, 17, 40]), then Deﬁnition 3.4
leads to a real-world approach to the modeling of multiple curves.

Aﬃne multi-curve models lead to a tractable structure for OIS bond prices and multiplicative
spreads. More precisely, aﬃne multi-curve models can be characterized via the exponentially aﬃne
form of OIS bond prices and spreads. To this end, let us give the following deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 3.5. The aﬃne process X is said to generate exponentially aﬃne OIS bond prices and
spreads if

(i) the B-discounted prices of OIS zero-coupon bonds satisfy

B(t, T )

for all 0 ≤ t ≤ T ≤ T,
for some functions A0 : [0, T] × [0, T] → R and B0 : [0, T] × [0, T] → V , and

Bt

= exp(cid:0)A0(t, T ) + (cid:104)B0(t, T ), Xt(cid:105)(cid:1),
Sδi(t, T ) = exp(cid:0)Ai(t, T ) + (cid:104)Bi(t, T ), Xt(cid:105)(cid:1),

for all 0 ≤ t ≤ T ≤ T,

(ii) the multiplicative spreads satisfy

(3.7)

(3.8)

for some functions Ai : [0, T] × [0, T] → R and Bi : [0, T] × [0, T] → V , for all i = 1, . . . , m.

The following proposition provides the announced characterization of aﬃne multi-curve models,

thereby showing that Deﬁnition 3.4 turns out to be equivalent to Deﬁnition 3.5.

Proposition 3.6. Let X be an aﬃne process. Then the following hold:

A0(t, T ) = v0(T ) + φ(cid:0)T − t, u0(T )(cid:1),
B0(t, T ) = ψ(cid:0)T − t, u0(T )(cid:1),
Ai(t, T ) = vi(T ) + φ(cid:0)T − t, ui(T ) + u0(T )(cid:1) − φ(cid:0)T − t, u0(T )(cid:1),
Bi(t, T ) = ψ(cid:0)T − t, ui(T ) + u0(T )(cid:1) − ψ(cid:0)T − t, u0(T )(cid:1),

(3.9)

for all 0 ≤ t ≤ T ≤ T and i = 1, . . . , m, where φ and ψ denote the characteristic exponents of
X as in Deﬁnition 3.1;

(ii) conversely, if X generates exponentially aﬃne OIS bond prices and spreads, then (X, u, v) is

an aﬃne multi-curve model, where the functions ui, vi, i = 0, 1, . . . , m, are given by

(3.10)

v0(t) = A0(t, t),

u0(t) = B0(t, t),

vi(t) = Ai(t, t),

ui(t) = Bi(t, t),

for all t ∈ [0, T] and i = 1, . . . , m.

Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that (X, u, v) is an aﬃne multi-curve model. Then, in view of Proposition 2.4,
OIS bond prices are given by

where the last equality follows from (3.2) together with the assumption that u0(T ) ∈ UT (see also
Remark 3.2). This proves that representation (3.7) holds with the functions A0 and B0 being given as
in (3.9). Similarly, Proposition 2.4 together with the assumption that ui(T ) + u0(T ) ∈ UT , for every
T ∈ [0, T] and i = 1, . . . , m, implies that the multiplicative spreads satisfy

Sδi(t, T ) = EQT

thus showing that representation (3.8) holds with the functions Ai and Bi being given as in (3.9).

Conversely, suppose that X generates exponentially aﬃne OIS bond prices and spreads. Then, for

every t ∈ [0, T], letting T = t in (3.7)-(3.8) and recalling that B(t, t) = 1, it follows that

log Bt = −A0(t, t) − (cid:104)B0(t, t), Xt(cid:105)

and

log Sδi(t, t) = Ai(t, t) + (cid:104)Bi(t, t), Xt(cid:105).

Deﬁning the functions ui and vi as in (3.10), this proves that representations (3.5)-(3.6) hold true.
It remains to prove that u0(T ) = B0(T, T ) ∈ UT and ui(T ) + u0(T ) = Bi(T, T ) + B0(T, T ) ∈ UT , for
every T ∈ [0, T] and i = 1, . . . , m. This follows from Proposition 2.4, since

E(cid:104)

Together with Remark 3.2, this implies that u0(T ) ∈ UT and ui(T ) + u0(T ) ∈ UT , for all T ∈ [0, T]
(cid:3)
and i = 1, . . . , m, thus proving that (X, u, v) is an aﬃne multi-curve model.

AFFINE MULTIPLE YIELD CURVE MODELS

In particular, Proposition 3.6 implies that aﬃne multi-curve models admit explicit valuation formu-
las for all linear interest rate derivatives (i.e., FRA contracts, interest rate swaps, overnight swaps and
basis swaps), since their prices can always be expressed in terms of OIS bond prices and multiplicative
spreads (see Appendix A.1).

A major issue when modeling multiple curves consists in characterizing when the multiplicative
spreads are greater than one and ordered with respect to the tenor’s length, as it is the case in
typical market scenarios. To this eﬀect, we can establish the following result (compare also with [13,
Corollary 3.17]).

Proposition 3.7. Let (X, u, v) be an aﬃne multi-curve model. Suppose that the process X is of the
form X = (X 0, Z) and takes values in a state space D = DX 0 × CZ, with CZ a cone. Suppose that
vi(t) ≥ 0, for all t ∈ [0, T] and that the functions ui are of the form ui = (0, wi) with wi : [0, T] → C∗
Z,
Z denotes the dual cone of CZ, for all i = 1, . . . , m. Then Sδi(t, T ) ≥ 1 for all 0 ≤ t ≤ T ≤ T
where C∗
and i ∈ {1, . . . , m}. Moreover, if in addition

v1(t) ≤ v2(t) ≤ . . . ≤ vm(t)

and
with ≺ denoting the partial order on C∗

w1(t) ≺ w2(t) ≺ . . . ≺ wm(t),

for all t ∈ [0, T],

Z, then it holds that

Sδ1(t, T ) ≤ Sδ2(t, T ) ≤ . . . ≤ Sδm(t, T ),

for all 0 ≤ t ≤ T ≤ T.

Proof. The assertion is a direct consequence of Proposition 2.4, stating that the process (Sδi(t, T ))0≤t≤T
is a QT -martingale, for every i = 1, . . . , m and T ∈ [0, T]. It thus satisﬁes

Sδi(t, T ) = EQT

[Sδi(T, T )|Ft] = EQT

[evi(T )+(cid:104)wi(T ),ZT (cid:105)|Ft],

for all t ∈ [0, T].

(cid:3)

Besides the modeling ﬂexibility and tractability ensured by aﬃne processes, this facility of generating
spreads which are greater than one and ordered with respect to the tenor’s length represents one of
the main advantages of specifying multiplicative spreads via (3.6).

The family of functions v = (v0, v1, . . . , vm) appearing in Deﬁnition 3.4 can always be chosen in
such a way to automatically achieve an exact ﬁt to the initially observed term structures of OIS bond
prices and multiplicative spreads. We denote by BM (0, T ) the price of an OIS zero-coupon bond
with maturity T observed on the market at the initial date t = 0 and, similarly, by SM,δi(0, T ) the
multiplicative spread of tenor δi observed on the market at t = 0, for i = 1, . . . , m and T ∈ [0, T]. We
say that an exact ﬁt to the initially observed term structures is achieved if

B(0, T ) = BM (0, T )

and

Sδi(0, T ) = SM,δi(0, T ),

for all T ∈ [0, T] and i = 1, . . . , m.

The following proposition provides a necessary and suﬃcient condition for an exact ﬁt to hold. If
(X, u, v) is an aﬃne multi-curve model, we denote by B0(t, T ) and S0,δi(t, T ), for 0 ≤ t ≤ T ≤ T and
i = 1, . . . , m, the theoretical bond prices and spreads computed according to the model (X, u, 0) via
(3.7)-(3.9), i.e., with all the functions vi, i = 0, 1, . . . , m, set equal to zero.

Proposition 3.8. An aﬃne multi-curve model (X, u, v) achieves an exact ﬁt to the initially observed
term structures if and only if the family of functions v = (v0, v1, . . . , vm) satisﬁes

v0(t) = log BM (0, t) − log B0(0, t),
vi(t) = log SM,δi(0, t) − log S0,δi(0, t),

for all t ∈ [0, T],
for all t ∈ [0, T] and i = 1, . . . , m,

with B0(0, t) and S0,δi(0, t) denoting the theoretical bond prices and spreads computed according to the
aﬃne multi-curve model (X, u, 0) via (3.7)-(3.9), for t ∈ [0, T] and i = 1, . . . , m.

3.3. Aﬃne short rate multi-curve models. We have so far introduced a general setup based on
aﬃne processes for modeling multiple curves. As outlined in the previous subsection, depending on
the choice of the num´eraire-martingale measure couple (B, Q), diﬀerent modeling approaches can be
obtained from Deﬁnition 3.4. We now specialize the above general framework to the classical setting
where the num´eraire is given by the OIS bank account, deﬁned with respect to the (risk-free) OIS
short rate process r = (rt)0≤t≤T, and Q is the associated (spot) martingale measure. More speciﬁcally,
in this subsection we shall work under the following assumption.

0 rudu), for all t ∈ [0, T],
where r = (rt)0≤t≤T is a real-valued (Ft)-adapted process denoting the OIS short rate. The probability
measure Q is such that the B-discounted price of every basic traded asset is a Q-martingale.

Assumption 3.9. The num´eraire B = (Bt)0≤t≤T satisﬁes Bt = exp((cid:82) t
also introduce the auxiliary aﬃne process Y = (Yt)0≤t≤T deﬁned by Yt := (Xt,(cid:82) t
Deﬁnition 3.10. Let λ ∈ VX , (cid:96) : [0, T] → R such that (cid:82) T

Throughout this subsection, let X = (Xt)0≤t≤T be an aﬃne process taking values in DX ⊆ VX . We
0 Xudu), for t ∈ [0, T],
and taking values in DY := DX × DX . The set UY is deﬁned as in (3.1) with respect to Y . We

and c = (c1, . . . , cm) a family of functions ci : [0, T] → R, i = 1, . . . , m. The tuple (X, (cid:96), λ, c, γ) is said
to be an aﬃne short rate multi-curve model if (Y, u, v) is an aﬃne multi-curve model in the sense of
Deﬁnition 3.4, where

0 rudu), assuming that a tuple (X, (cid:96), λ, c, γ) is an aﬃne
short rate multi-curve model in the sense of Deﬁnition 3.10 is equivalent to letting the OIS short rate
rt and the spot multiplicative spreads Sδi(t, t) be speciﬁed as follows:
for all t ∈ [0, T],
for all t ∈ [0, T] and i = 1, . . . , m.

rt = (cid:96)(t) + (cid:104)λ, Xt(cid:105),
log Sδi(t, t) = ci(t) + (cid:104)γi, Xt(cid:105),

(3.11)

(3.12)

Note that Deﬁnition 3.10 implicitly requires (via Deﬁnition 3.4) that the parameters λ and γ =
(γ1, . . . , γm) satisfy (γi,−λ) ∈ UY , for all i = 0, 1, . . . , m, with γ0 := 0.

Remark 3.11. If the function (cid:96) is chosen to be constant and c and γ set to 0, Deﬁnition 3.10 reduces
to a classical (i.e., single-curve) time-homogeneous aﬃne short rate model. By additionally allowing
(cid:96) and also c to be deterministic functions we introduce a time-inhomogeneity which in turn enables

AFFINE MULTIPLE YIELD CURVE MODELS

11

a perfect ﬁt to the initial term structures (see Proposition 3.15 below). Deﬁnition 3.10 thus already
incorporates deterministic shift extended models ﬁrst introduced in [4] in the single curve setting and
recently taken up in [23] in the multi-curve setting (cf. Section 3.4.1 for the relation between [23] and
the present setting).

X = (X 0, Z1, . . . , Zm), where X 0 is an aﬃne process on some state space DX 0 and Zi :=(cid:82) ·

Remark 3.12. In Deﬁnition 3.10, the OIS bank account is speciﬁed via a short rate modeled as in
(3.11). By analogy, multiplicative spreads can also be speciﬁed via an instantaneous short spread rate,
similarly as in [13, Remark 3.19]. This can be achieved by letting the aﬃne process X be of the form
s )ds,
with qi : DX 0 → R being an aﬃne function, for all i = 1, . . . , m. The coeﬃcients c = (c1, . . . , cm) and
γ = (γ1, . . . , γm) are chosen as ci := 0 and γi := (0, ei), for all i = 1, . . . , m, with {e1, . . . , em} being
the canonical basis of Rm. The spot multiplicative spreads admit then the representation

0 qi(X 0

Sδi(t, t) = eZi

t = e

0 qi(X 0

s )ds,

for all t ∈ [0, T] and i = 1, . . . , m,

(cid:82) t

where the process (qi(X 0

t ))0≤t≤T can be interpreted as a short spread rate, for i = 1, . . . , m.

Similarly as in the case of general aﬃne multi-curve models, aﬃne short rate multi-curve models
admit an equivalent characterization in terms of the structure of OIS bond prices and spreads. More
speciﬁcally, we can establish the following result, which specializes Proposition 3.6.

Proposition 3.13. Let X be an aﬃne process and suppose that Assumption 3.9 holds. Then the
following hold:

(i) if (X, (cid:96), λ, c, γ) is an aﬃne short rate multi-curve model, then X generates exponentially aﬃne

OIS bond prices and spreads, in the sense that

where the functions (cid:101)Ai, (cid:101)Bi, i = 0, 1, . . . , m, are given by

(cid:101)A0(t, T ) = −
(cid:101)Ai(t, T ) = ci(T ) + ˜φ(T − t, γi,−λ) − ˜φ(T − t, 0,−λ),

for all 0 ≤ t ≤ T ≤ T and i = 1, . . . , m, with ˜φ and ˜ψ denoting the characteristic exponents

of the aﬃne process Y = (X,(cid:82) ·
(cid:101)Ai, (cid:101)Bi, i = 0, 1, . . . , m, with T (cid:55)→ (cid:101)A0(t, T ) and T (cid:55)→ (cid:101)B0(T ) diﬀerentiable, for all t ∈ [0, T],

(ii) conversely, if OIS bond prices and spreads admit the representation (3.13) for some functions

0 Xudu) as in Lemma 3.3;

(cid:96)(t) = − ∂
∂T

(cid:0)(cid:101)A0(cid:1)(t, T )|T =t,

then (X, (cid:96), λ, c, γ) is an aﬃne short rate model, where, for all i = 1, . . . , m,

λ = −(cid:0)(cid:101)B0(cid:1)(cid:48)
Proof. Noting that the aﬃne process Y = (X,(cid:82) ·
and spreads admit the representation (3.13) with respect to some diﬀerentiable functions (cid:101)Ai and (cid:101)Bi,

0 Xudu) satisﬁes the assumptions of Lemma 3.3, part
(i) easily follows from Deﬁnition 3.10 together with Proposition 3.6. Conversely, if OIS bond prices

ci(t) = (cid:101)Ai(t, t)

γi = (cid:101)Bi(0).

and

(0),

i = 0, 1, . . . , m, then the instantaneous OIS forward rate is given by

((cid:101)A0)(t, T ) − (cid:104)((cid:101)B0)(cid:48)(T − t), Xt(cid:105),

for all 0 ≤ t ≤ T ≤ T,

ft(T ) := − ∂

log B(t, T ) = − ∂

12

so that the OIS short rate rt satisﬁes

((cid:101)A0)(t, T )|T =t − (cid:104)((cid:101)B0)(cid:48)(0), Xt(cid:105) =: (cid:96)(t) + (cid:104)λ, Xt(cid:105),

rt = ft(t) = − ∂

Representations (3.11)-(3.12) then follow by letting ci(t) := (cid:101)Ai(t, t) and γi

for all t ∈ [0, T].

:= (cid:101)Bi(0), for all i =

1, . . . , m. Finally, the condition (γi,−λ) ∈ UY , for all i = 0, 1, . . . , m, with γ0 := 0, follows by the
(cid:3)
same arguments used in the last part of the proof of Proposition 3.6.

In view of Proposition 3.7, multiplicative spreads greater than one and ordered with respect to the

tenor’s length can be easily generated by aﬃne short rate multi-curve models.

Remark 3.14 (On the possibility of negative OIS short rates and spreads greater than one). In the
current market environment, negative OIS short rates have been observed to coexist with spreads
which are strictly greater than one and ordered with respect to the tenor’s length. This market
scenario can be easily captured by letting the aﬃne process X be of the form X = (X 0, Z) and take
value in a state space of the form Rn × CZ, for some n ∈ N and where CZ is a cone. If (cid:96) takes values
in R, λ ∈ Rn and the assumptions of Proposition 3.7 are satisﬁed, then spreads will be greater than
one and ordered, while the OIS short rate will not be restricted to positive values only.

Similarly to Proposition 3.8, there exists a necessary and suﬃcient condition to achieve an exact
ﬁt to the initially observed term structures. Let us denote by B0(t, T ) and S0,δi(t, T ) the bond prices
and spreads computed according to the model (X, 0, λ, 0, γ). Moreover, we denote by T (cid:55)→ BM (0, T )
and {T (cid:55)→ SM,δi(0, T ); i = 1, . . . , m} the initially observed term structures of OIS bond prices and
spreads. We also deﬁne the corresponding OIS forward rates by

t (T ) := − ∂
f M
∂T

log BM (t, T )

and

t (T ) := − ∂
f 0
∂T

log B0(t, T ),

for all 0 ≤ t ≤ T ≤ T.

The following result is a direct consequence of the above deﬁnitions together with Proposition 3.8.

Proposition 3.15. Suppose that Assumption 3.9 holds. Then an aﬃne short rate multi-curve model
(X, (cid:96), λ, c, γ) achieves an exact ﬁt to the initially observed term structures if and only if

0 (t) − f 0

(cid:96)(t) = f M
ci(t) = log SM,δi(0, t) − log S0,δi(0, t),

0 (t),

for all t ∈ [0, T],
for all t ∈ [0, T] and i = 1, . . . , m.

Remark 3.16. In view of Proposition 3.15, assuming that the spreads S0,δi(t, T ) generated by (X, 0, λ, 0, γ)
are greater than one and ordered, it then easily follows that

(i) for any i ∈ {1, . . . , m}, if SM,δi(0, t) ≥ S0,δi(0, t), for all t ∈ [0, T], then Sδi(t, T ) ≥ 1, for all

0 ≤ t ≤ T ≤ T;

(ii) for any i, j ∈ {1, . . . , m} with i < j, if

log SM,δi(0, t) − log SM,δj (0, t) ≤ log S0,δi(0, t) − log S0,δj (0, t),
then Sδi(t, T ) ≤ Sδj (t, T ), for all 0 ≤ t ≤ T ≤ T.

for all t ∈ [0, T],

3.4. Relations with existing multi-curve models based on aﬃne processes. In this section,
we discuss how our framework relates to other multiple curve models based on aﬃne processes that
have been recently proposed in the literature. We show that all the existing approaches we are aware
of can be recovered as special cases of our setup.

3.4.1. Short rate models. As mentioned in the introduction, short rate models based on aﬃne processes
have been proposed for modeling multiple curves, see [18, 23, 24, 35, 36, 39]. A general framework

AFFINE MULTIPLE YIELD CURVE MODELS

13

encompassing all the models introduced in these papers has been recently provided in [26, Chapter
2]. In that work, the authors assume that the num´eraire is given as usual by the OIS bank account,
modeled via a short rate r = (rt)0≤t≤T, with a corresponding martingale measure Q. Considering for
simplicity of presentation a single tenor δ > 0, spot Libor rates Lt(t, t + δ) are then speciﬁed by

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

Lt(t, t + δ) =

Bδ(t, t + δ)

,

for all 0 ≤ t ≤ T,

where Bδ(t, t + δ) denotes the price at date t of an artiﬁcial risky bond with maturity t + δ. Note
that risky bonds are only introduced as a modeling tool, their riskiness being referred to the interbank
market, and do not represent real traded assets. By analogy to the short rate approach in a classical
single-curve setting, OIS bond prices and risky bond prices are assumed to be given by

B(t, T ) = E(cid:104)
t rudu(cid:12)(cid:12)Ft
e−(cid:82) T

(cid:105)

and Bδ(t, T ) = E(cid:104)

e−(cid:82) T

(cid:105)

,

for all 0 ≤ t ≤ T ≤ T, where s = (st)0≤t≤T denotes an instantaneous spread. The OIS short rate rt
and the spread st are modeled as aﬃne functions of a common aﬃne process X = (Xt)0≤t≤T taking
+ × Rd−n ([23] also consider the case of a Wishart process X
values on some state space D ⊆ V := Rn
and deterministic shift extensions, meaning that the constant part of the aﬃne function is actually a
deterministic function in time). This framework can be regarded as a special case of our aﬃne short
rate setup introduced in Section 3.3. Indeed, it suﬃces to observe that in the present setting the spot
multiplicative spreads can be represented as

speciﬁcation of the aﬃne functions for rt and st. This shows that the representations (3.11)-(3.12) hold
with respect to the underlying aﬃne process X. Similar considerations allow to recover the Gaussian
exponentially quadratic model recently proposed in [24]. Since the spot multiplicative spread is an
observable quantity, unlike the instantaneous spread st, it seems to us more natural to deﬁne aﬃne
short rate multi-curve models directly with respect to spot multiplicative spreads as in Deﬁnition 3.10.

3.4.2. Aﬃne Libor models. The general aﬃne multi-curve setup introduced in Section 3.2 allows to
recover a generalization of the model recently introduced in [25], which extends to a multi-curve setting
the aﬃne Libor model originally proposed in [33]. In this setting, the num´eraire - martingale measure
couple (B, Q) is given by the OIS zero-coupon bond with maturity T and the corresponding T-forward
measure, i.e., (B, Q) = (B(·, T), QT
). We explicitly indicate this measure in the expectations below.
As in Section 3.2, consider an aﬃne process X = (Xt)0≤t≤T (under QT

By its own nature, the model of [25] is formulated with respect to a ﬁnite collection of maturities.
However, a continuous extension can be obtained by considering a function u : [0, T] → U such that
u(T δ

to [33, Section 6], let OIS bond prices be given as follows:

Sδ(t, T ) = M v(T,δ)
[exp ((cid:104)v(T, δ), XT(cid:105))|Ft]. Observe that, in order to ensure that Sδ(t, T ) ≥ 1, for
with M v(T,δ)
all 0 ≤ t ≤ T ≤ T and δ > 0, it suﬃces to require that v(T, δ) ≥ u(T ) for all T ∈ [0, T] and δ > 0.
Similarly, order relations among multiplicative spreads Sδ(t, T ) associated to diﬀerent tenors can be
obtained by imposing suitable requirements on the function δ (cid:55)→ v(T, δ).

for all 0 ≤ t ≤ T ≤ T and δ > 0,

where φ and ψ denote the characteristic exponents of X. Similarly, representation (3.16) implies that
the spot multiplicative spreads satisfy, for all t ∈ [0, T] and δ > 0,

= φ(cid:0)T − t, v(t, δ)(cid:1) − φ(cid:0)T − t, u(t)(cid:1) +(cid:10)ψ(cid:0)T − t, v(t, δ)(cid:1) − ψ(cid:0)T − t, u(t)(cid:1), Xt

The model (3.15)-(3.16) thus represents a special case of our general aﬃne multi-curve framework.
Indeed, representations (3.5)-(3.6) follow by letting, for all t ∈ [0, T] and i = 1, . . . , m,

v0(t) := φ(cid:0)T − t, u(t)(cid:1),
vi(t) := φ(cid:0)T − t, v(t, δi)(cid:1) − φ(cid:0)T − t, u(t)(cid:1),

u0(t) := ψ(cid:0)T − t, u(t)(cid:1),
ui(t) := ψ(cid:0)T − t, v(t, δi)(cid:1) − ψ(cid:0)T − t, u(t)(cid:1).

Moreover, in view of [32, Lemma 4.3], it holds that u0(T ) ∈ UT and ui(T ) + u0(T ) ∈ UT , for all
T ∈ [0, T] and i = 1, . . . , m, thus showing that this version of the aﬃne Libor model with multiple
curves can be recovered as a special case of Deﬁnition 3.4.

3.4.3. Aﬃne multiple yield curve models in the sense of [13]. When choosing (cid:96) and c to be constant,
Deﬁnition 3.10 is equivalent to [13, Deﬁnition 5.3]. For clarity of notation, let us denote all the
ingredients appearing in [13, Deﬁnition 5.3] with Fractur letters. Then [13, Deﬁnition 5.3] can be
embedded into Deﬁnition 3.10 by setting X := (X, Y), ci = 0 and γi = (0, ui), for all i = 1, . . . , m.
Conversely, Deﬁnition 3.10 can be embedded into [13, Deﬁnition 5.3] by letting X = X, Y = (1, X),
i = ci and uj+1
u1
i , for all j = 1, . . . , dim(VX ) and i = 1, . . . , m. In view of [13, Proposition 5.7],
this implies that every aﬃne short rate multi-curve model in the sense of Deﬁnition 3.10 belongs to the
class of risk neutral HJM-type multiple yield curve models introduced in [13], with the forward rates
and forward spread rates admitting explicit representations in terms of the characteristic exponents
of X.

4. General pricing formulae for caplets and swaptions

We now show that aﬃne multi-curve models, in the sense of Deﬁnition 3.4, lead to tractable gen-
eral valuation formulae for caplets and swaptions. We compute clean-prices and follow the pricing
approach outlined in [13, Appendix A], in particular assuming that the collateral account is given by

the num´eraire asset. For simplicity of presentation, we shall consider a ﬁxed maturity T > 0 and
assume that (X, u, v) is an aﬃne multi-curve model in the sense of Deﬁnition 3.4.

4.1. Caplets. In the present aﬃne setting, caplets can be easily priced by means of Fourier techniques.
As a preliminary, let i ∈ {1, . . . , m} and deﬁne the stochastic process (Yt)t∈[0,T +δi] by

The sets AYT and ΛYT depend on the speciﬁc choice of the driving process X. By relying on [38,
Theorem 5.1], we now provide a general caplet pricing formula, which is valid for any choice of the
underlying aﬃne process X and for diﬀerent choices of the contour of integration. In particular, the
next result highlights the tractability of our framework: caplets can be priced by means of univariate
Fourier integrals. In turn, this implies that a calibration may be obtained with a reasonable amount of
computational eﬀort (which may be further reduced by means of an application of an FFT algorithm).
Proposition 4.2. Let ζ ∈ C,  ∈ R, ¯K := 1 + δK and assume that 1 +  ∈ AYT . Then the price at

Since the modiﬁed moment generating function of YT can be explicitly computed as in (4.2), the
pricing of a caplet is thus reduced to the pricing of a call option written on an asset whose characteristic
function is explicitly known. At this point, a direct application of [38, Theorem 5.1] yields the result.
Note that, in the terminology of [38, Theorem 5.1], the present case corresponds to G = G1 and b1 = 1,
which is an element of AYT by Deﬁnition 3.4.
(cid:3)

4.2. Swaptions. In the present general setting, swaptions do not admit a closed-form pricing formula.
Indeed, on the one side, we consider general multi-factor models, so that the “Jamshidian trick” (see
[28]) is not applicable; on the other side, in a multiple curve setting, a payer (resp. receiver) swaption
cannot be represented as a put (resp. call) option on a coupon bond. In this subsection, by relying
on Fourier methods and along the lines of [6, 7], we provide a general analytical approximation which
exploits the aﬃne property of our framework. We work in the general setting of Section 3.2, noting
that all formulas admit suitable simpliﬁcations in the case of aﬃne short-rate multi-curve models.

We consider a European payer swaption with maturity T , written on a (payer) interest rate swap
starting at T0 = T , with payment dates T1, . . . , TN , with Tj+1 − Tj = δi for j = 1, . . . ,N − 1 and
i ∈ {1, . . . , m}, with notional N . As shown in Appendix A.2, the value of such a claim at date t is
given by

ΠSW P T N (t; T1, TN , K, N ) = NE

B(T, Tj−1)Sδi(T, Tj−1) − (1 + δiK)B(T, Tj)

The general idea underlying our approximation consists in approximating the exercise region by an
event deﬁned in terms of an aﬃne function of XT . More speciﬁcally, we have that

Proof. The claim is a direct consequence of [38, Theorem 5.1], noting that each summand appearing
in (4.4) corresponds in the notation of [38] to the case G = G3, b1 = ψ(Tl− T, ui,j(Tl) + u0(Tl)), b0 = β
(cid:3)
and k = α.

Proposition 4.3 gives a general lower bound for the price of a swaption, parameterized in terms of
(α, β). These parameters should be determined in such a way that the lower bound becomes as tight
as possible, while at the same time ensuring the ﬁniteness of suitable exponential moments of XT . As
pointed out in [6], to which we refer for more details on the numerical implementation, the values of
(α, β) can be chosen in two ways:

Note that this solution can be computationally demanding, especially for highly dimensional

in order to ensure the ﬁniteness of joint exponential moments of XT .

α, β (the well-known Singleton-Umantsev approximation constitutes an example in this sense,
see [44] and compare also with [37])3.

5. A tractable specification based on Wishart processes

(cid:16)

κQ(cid:62)Q + M Xt + XtM(cid:62)(cid:17)

(cid:112)

For notational simplicity we consider here the case of one single tenor δ and suppose that the driving

process X is a Wishart process on (Ω,F, (Ft), Q) with state space S+

d of the form

dXt =

(5.1)
where W is d× d matrix of Brownian motions, κ ≥ d− 1 and Q, M are d× d matrices. We consider an
aﬃne short rate multi-curve model as of Section 3.3 with short rate r(t) = (cid:96)(t) + (cid:104)λ, Xt(cid:105) and spread
log Sδ(t, t) = c(t) +(cid:104)γ, Xt(cid:105), where c(t) ∈ R+ and γ ∈ S+
d to guarantee positivity of the spreads. Recall
that the scalar product (cid:104)·,·(cid:105) is here the trace.

Xt, X0 = x0,

(cid:112)

Remark 5.1. By choosing λ and γ to be diagonal matrices, the above model represents a natural
extension of the classical CIR model to the multiple curve setting since the diagonal elements of a
Wishart process are stochastically correlated CIR processes.

The goal of this section is to study the pricing of caps for this particular model. As shown in

Section A.2, the price of a caplet with unitary notional can be computed via

(5.2)

ΠCP LT (t; T, T + δ, K, 1) = Sδ(t, T )B(t, T )(cid:101)Q(cid:104)
where the probability measure (cid:101)Q ∼ Q is deﬁned via

− (1 + δK)B(t, T + δ)QT +δ(cid:104)
d(cid:101)Q

dQ :=

Sδ(T, T )B(T, T )
BT Sδ(0, T )B(0, T )

.

(cid:105)

Sδ(T, T ) ≥ (1 + δK)B(T, T + δ)|Ft

Sδ(T, T ) ≥ (1 + δK)B(T, T + δ)|Ft

(cid:105)

,

In the case of the above introduced model, it can be easily shown that the process X follows under

both measures(cid:101)Q and QT +δ a non-central Wishart distribution with time dependent parameters, which

is stated in Lemma 5.3 below. As the density is (up to the solution of ODEs) explicitly known, this
allows obtaining (semi-)analytical pricing formulas for caplets, similarly as in the CIR model. As a
preliminary, let us introduce the following deﬁnition, in line with [30, Deﬁnition A.4].
Deﬁnition 5.2. Suppose that κ ≥ d − 1, Σ ∈ S+
positive semideﬁnite. A symmetric positive deﬁnite random matrix U is said to be non-centrally
Wishart distributed with κ degrees of freedom, covariance matrix Σ, and matrix of non-centrality
parameter Θ, if its Laplace transform satisﬁes

d and Θ is a d × d matrix such that ΣΘ is symmetric

E[e−(cid:104)u,U(cid:105)] = det(Id − 2uΣ)− δ

2 e−(cid:104)u(Id+2uΣ)−1,ΣΘ(cid:105).

3We also want to mention that, in the recent paper [25], the performance of the Singleton-Umantsev approximation has
been empirically tested and compared to Monte-Carlo simulations in the context of a multi-curve model.

In this case, we write U ∼ Wd(κ, Σ, Θ).

5.2. A closed form expression for the price of caplet. Finally, by relying on the above results,
we are ready to give a (semi-)analytical formula for the price of a caplet in the above Wishart model.

model with

• OIS short rate rt = (cid:96)(t) + (cid:104)λ, Xt(cid:105), for all t ∈ [0, T] and
• logarithmic multiplicative spreads log Sδ(t, t) = c(t) + (cid:104)γ, Xt(cid:105), for all t ∈ [0, T].

Then the price of a caplet at date 0 with unitary notional, reset date T and payoﬀ δ(LT (T, T +δ)−K)+
at the settlement date T + δ, is given by

(5.5) ΠCP LT (0; T, T +δ, K, 1) = Sδ(0, T )B(0, T )(cid:0)1−(cid:101)FT (CT,K)(cid:1)−(1+δK)B(0, T +δ)(cid:0)1−FT (CT,K)(cid:1),

additionally on the strike. In the case where (cid:96) and c are constants, C only depends on K and we
write only CK. In this case the matrix (FT (CK))T∈{T1,...,Tm},K∈{K1,...,Kl} for diﬀerent maturities and
strikes needed for calibration purposes can be obtained by a matrix product U V where U ∈ Rm×n

6. Model calibration

In this section, we discuss the calibration of two simple speciﬁcations of our general aﬃne multi-
curve framework to caplet market data. The aim is to illustrate the practical feasibility of the proposed
approach and it is not meant to represent a thorough calibration analysis of a speciﬁc model. We start
by brieﬂy describing our market data sample.

6.1. Market data. Our data sample consists of a cross section of market quotes (corresponding
to perfectly collateralized transactions as of August 22, 2011) of linear and non-linear interest rate
derivatives. As far as linear products are concerned, we consider market data for overnight indexed
swaps and interest rate swaps. As a preliminary step, on the basis of market quotes of linear products,
we construct the OIS discount curve T (cid:55)→ B(0, T ) and the forward curve T (cid:55)→ L0(T, T + δ), for a
given choice of the tenor length δ (in our case, 6 months). This has been performed by relying on the
Finmath Java library (see [21]), which was linked to a spreadsheet application via the Obba add-in
(see [22]; full documentation on the procedure is provided in [20]). Figure 1 depicts the interest rate
curves obtained by following such a procedure.

Figure 1. Discount and forward curves as of August 22, 2011.

Concerning non-linear interest rate products, we consider a caplet implied volatility surface, suitably
bootstrapped from cap implied volatility data. The surface refers to strike prices ranging between
0.75% and 6% and maturities between 3 and 10 years. Let us recall that caps with maturity larger
than two years are indexed to the 6-month forward rate. Hence, given the set of maturities we consider,
we restrict our attention to the single tenor δ =6M. Note that, in the post-crisis interest rate market,

the quoting convention for implied volatilities shifted from log-normal (Black) to normal (Bachelier)

normal), such that the Bachelier pricing formula for a caplet

We perform a ﬁrst approximation by introducing a trapezoidal rule of the form zj1 := η(j1 − 1), η >
0, j1 = 1, . . . , N , so that the eﬀective upper limit of integration is now given by (N − 1)η. As we want
to perform a simultaneous evaluation of the integral term for a grid of strike prices, we also introduce
a grid for k of the form kj2 := −b + η(cid:63)(j2 − 1), η(cid:63) > 0, j2 = 1, . . . , N , which gives a mesh covering
the interval [−b, b), with b = 0.5N η(cid:63). Since we want to apply the FFT algorithm, we need to impose
the Nyquist condition, meaning that we set ηη(cid:63) = 2π/N , thus introducing a tradeoﬀ between the
accuracy of the log-strike and integration grids. As suggested by [8], we introduce the weights of the
Simpson rule, in order to obtain a satisfactory accuracy even for large values of η. In summary, the
integral term (along a grid of log-strikes) is approximated via

Formula (6.1) can be computed by a direct application of the FFT algorithm. In our experiments, we
set N = 4096 and η = 0.1.

For a given vector of model parameters p, belonging to the set of admissible parameters P, we
compute caplet prices using the above methodology and convert them into model implied normal
volatilities, that we denote by σimp

mod(p). The aim of the calibration procedure is to solve

6.3. Calibration results. In the following we concretely illustrate the two candidate speciﬁcations
we propose along with their calibration results. Note that both models allow for a perfect ﬁt to the
observed term structures via a suitable choice of the functions (cid:96) and c in line with Proposition 3.15.

Table 1 reports the calibrated model parameters while Figure 2 illustrates the quality of the ﬁt

In particular, despite its simplicity, the model achieves
a reasonably good ﬁt to the observed market quotes. The quality of the ﬁt is lower for low strikes
and for the ﬁrst maturity we considered (3 years). Note also that the computational complexity of
the procedure is at the same level of a calibration of a standard aﬃne stochastic volatility model for
equities.

6.3.2. Wishart-Gamma model. We now present the results of the calibration to the same market data
sample of a simple model driven by a Wishart process. To the best of our knowledge, this represents
the ﬁrst example of the calibration of a Wishart-driven interest rate model to market data on non-
linear products. Let X = (X 1, X 2) be a process where X 1 is a Wishart process as deﬁned in (5.1)
for d = 2 and X 2 is a Gamma process exactly as in the ﬁrst model considered above. The short rate
is speciﬁed as rt = (cid:96)(t) + λ(cid:104)Id, X 1
t (cid:105) + X 2
t )
with γ, λ ∈ R. We term this speciﬁcation Wishart-Gamma model. We report in Table 2 the calibrated
parameters, while Figure 3 illustrates the quality of the ﬁt in terms of price and implied volatility
errors.

Remark 6.1. We want to point out that, since the caplet pricing formula obtained in Proposition
4.2 only depends on the speciﬁc form of the solutions to the system of generalized Riccati ODEs,
the overall structure of the software implementation does not depend on the speciﬁc combination of
processes/state spaces.

Appendix A. General pricing formulae

This appendix presents general pricing formulas for typical interest rate derivatives. As we are
going to show, the quantity Sδ(t, T ) plays a pivotal role in the valuation of interest rate products. We
here derive clean prices in the spirit of [13, Appendix A], assuming perfect collateralization with the
collateral asset being equal to the num´eraire.

A.1. Linear products. The prices of linear interest rate products (i.e., without optionality features)
can be directly expressed in terms of the basic quantities B(t, T ) and Sδ(t, T ).

Forward rate agreement.
A forward rate agreement (FRA) starting at T , with maturity T + δ, ﬁxed rate K and notional N is
a contract which pays at time T + δ the amount

ΠF RA(T + δ; T, T + δ, K, N ) = N δ(cid:0)LT (T, T + δ) − K(cid:1).

The value of such a claim at time t ≤ T is

ΠF RA(t; T, T + δ, K, N ) = N B(t, T + δ)δ EQT +δ

= N(cid:0)B(t, T )Sδ(t, T ) − B(t, T + δ)(1 + δK)(cid:1).

Overnight indexed swap.
An overnight indexed swap (OIS) is a contract where two counterparties exchange two streams of
payments: the ﬁrst one is computed with respect to a ﬁxed rate K, whereas the second one is indexed
by an overnight rate (EONIA). Let us denote by T1, . . . , Tn the payment dates, with Ti+1 − Ti = δ for
all i = 1, . . . , n − 1. The swap is initiated at T0 ∈ [0, T1). The value of an OIS at t ≤ T0 with notional
N can be expressed as (see e.g. [18, Section 2.5])

ΠOIS(t; T1, Tn, K, N ) = N

B(t, T0) − B(t, Tn) − Kδ

Interest rate swap.
In an interest rate swap (IRS), two streams of payments are exchanged between two counterparties:
the ﬁrst cash ﬂow is computed with respect to a ﬁxed rate K, whereas the second one is indexed by
the Libor rate. The value of the IRS at time t ≤ T0, where T0 denotes the inception time, is given by

ΠIRS(t; T1, Tn, K, N ) = N

B(t, Ti−1)Sδ(t, Ti−1) − B(t, Ti)(1 + δK)

Basis swap.
A basis swap is a special type of interest rate swap where two cash ﬂows related to Libor rates
associated to diﬀerent tenors are exchanged between two counterparties. For instance, a typical basis
swap may involve the exchange of the 3-month against the 6-month Libor rate. Following the standard
convention for the deﬁnition of a basis swap in the Euro market (see [2]), the basis swap is equivalent
to a long/short position on two diﬀerent interest rate swaps which share the same ﬁxed leg. Let
n3, T 1 ⊂ T 2,
n1 < n2 and corresponding tenor lengths δ1 > δ2, with no constraints on δ3. The ﬁrst two tenor
structures on the one side and the third on the other are associated to the two ﬂoating and to the
single ﬁxed leg, respectively. We denote by N the notional of the swap, which is initiated at time

A.2. Products with optionality features. In this section, we report general valuation formulas
for plain vanilla interest rate products such as (European) caplets and swaptions. Caplet.

Remark A.1. Note that, in the classical single curve setting (i.e., under the assumption that Sδ(T, T )
is identically equal to one), the valuation formula (A.1) reduces to the classical relationship between
a caplet and a put option on a zero-coupon bond with strike 1/(1 + δK).

From (A.1), we see that the payoﬀ of a caplet at time T and notional N = 1 corresponds to

(cid:16)

Sδ(T, T ) − (1 + δK)B(T, T + δ)

(cid:17)+

Swaption.
We consider a standard European payer swaption with maturity T , written on a (payer) interest rate
swap starting at T0 = T and payment dates T1, ..., Tn, with Ti+1 − Ti = δ for all i = 1, . . . , n − 1, with
notional N . The value of such a claim at time t is given by

Under Assumption 2.2, the process (B(t, T )/Bt)0≤t≤T is a martingale, for all T ∈ [0, T]. Since

thus proving part (i). In particular, note that this implies that B(0, T ) = E[1/BT ], thus ensuring that
dQT /dQ = 1/(BT B(0, T )) deﬁnes a probability measure QT ∼ Q, for every T ∈ [0, T]. Recalling that
ΠF RA(t; T, T + δi, Lt(T, T + δi)) = 0, for all 0 ≤ t ≤ T ≤ T and i = 1, . . . , m, it holds that

Since B(t, T + δi)/Bt > 0 by part (i), the last equality proves part (ii). Finally, by Bayes’ formula,
the process (Sδi(t, T ))0≤t≤T is a QT -martingale if and only if the process (M i
