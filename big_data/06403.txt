Two vortex rings can form a localized conﬁguration whereby they continually pass through one
another in an alternating fashion. This phenomenon is called leapfrogging. Using parameters suit-
able for superﬂuid helium-4, we describe a recurrence phenomenon that is similar to leapfrogging
which occurs for two coaxial straight vortex ﬁlaments with the same Kelvin wave mode. For small
amplitude Kelvin waves we demonstrate that our full Biot–Savart simulations closely follow pre-
dictions obtained from a simpiﬁed model that provides an analytical approximation developed for
nearly parallel vortices. Our results are also relevant to thin-cored helical vortices in classical ﬂuids.

INTRODUCTION

The mathematical foundation of vortex dynamics was
laid down by H. Helmholtz (1821-1894) [1, 2] who sub-
sequently applied his theory to study the propagation of
vortex rings.
In his work, he suggested that two vor-
tex rings moving along the same axis would thread each
other in an alternating fashion. The study of vortex rings
was also taken up by Lord Kelvin who also contributed
signiﬁcantly to our understanding of the motion of vor-
tices in general. Following the works of Helmholtz and
Kelvin, the leapfrogging motion of vortex rings has been
studied in more detail for classical ﬂuids [3–5], and also
for superﬂuids [6, 7].

Leapfrogging of vortex rings is an interesting example
of a recurrence phenomena involving two vortices.
In
this work, we will give another example of leapfrogging,
which greatly resembles the motion of two coaxial vortex
rings. Part of our motivation is to understand the inter-
action of Kelvin waves on quantized superﬂuid vortices.
It has been argued that Kelvin waves, which are helical
perturbations of a straight vortex, are important for the
energy dissipation in superﬂuid turbulence at very low
temperatures [8–10]. However, a large body of analytical
results, and a number of numerical studies rely on the
simplifying assumption of neglecting the interaction of
the Kelvin-waves between diﬀerent vortex ﬁlaments and
focus on how Kelvin waves evolve on a single ﬁlament.
Despite this, the justiﬁcation of these assumptions on
which many of these theories are based are not fully es-
tablished.

In this work we will uncover a novel type of interaction
between adjacent vortex ﬁlaments that can play an im-
portant role in our understanding of how energy is trans-
ferred across scales.
In particular, we note that some

Kelvin wave phenomena bear resemblance to the motion
of vortex rings. For example, a superﬂuid vortex ring ex-
periencing a counterﬂow (the relative velocity of normal
ﬂuid and superﬂuid [11]) through it will either shrink or
grow depending on the direction of the counterﬂow. Sim-
ilarly, the amplitude of a Kelvin wave will either decrease
or increase depending on the direction of the counterﬂow
along the vortex axis [12]. Although the correspondence
is not exact, in this work we propose that a stacked row
of vortex rings mimics the motion of Kelvin waves on a
vortex ﬁlament: it turns out that this analogy provides
a qualitative understanding of some of our results.

Aside from its importance for superﬂuid turbulence,
helical vortices are also important for classical ﬂuid dy-
namics. For example, the wake behind rotors can be
treated as one or many interlaced helical vortices. Other
circumstances where helical vortices are relevant include
wakes behind propellers, wind turbines or helicopter
blades [13–22]. Moreover, experiments have shown how
the adjacent turns of two helices may contract and ex-
pand in a manner that resembles leapfrogging of vortex
rings [14, 17].

In this work, we study the leapfrogging of helical vor-
tices, where the contraction and expansion occurs along
the entire helix as opposed to individual turns. In ordi-
nary viscous ﬂuids, it is expected that the interaction be-
tween helical vortices will eventually lead to the merging
of the vortices [20, 22]. However, in our superﬂuid con-
text, viscous eﬀects and the dynamics of the vortex core
are irrelevant (the core has a negligible atomic scale). In
this scenario, the problem of the interaction of the Kelvin
waves acquires its simplest possible form.

We model the dynamics of helical superﬂuid vortices
using a vortex ﬁlament model in which the vortices are

described as discretized space curves s(ξ, t) that are pa-
rameterised by their arclength, ξ. In our work, parame-
ters for superﬂuid helium-4 vortices are used: each vortex
has circulation κ = 0.0997 mm2/s and a core diameter
a0 ≈ 10−7 mm. Since the core diameter is several orders
of magnitude smaller than any other length scale in the
system, for example the characteristic intervortex sepa-
ration in the experiments, this justiﬁes the use of the ﬁl-
ament model. With this model, a ﬁlament is discretized
by a ﬁnite set of points along the curve s(ξ, t). Each
vortex point then evolves according to the Biot–Savart
law

where s1 = s(ξ1, t), dot denotes time derivative, and a
prime denotes diﬀerentiation with respect to arc-length.
The ﬁrst term arises from a commonly adopted regulari-
sation of the singular integrand in the expression for the
velocity in the Biot-Savart integral [23]. Lengths of the
two adjacent line segments connected to s are denoted
by l±. The Biot–Savart integral contained in the second
term is then evaluated over the segments of the curve
excluding a small interval {s(ξ − l−), s(ξ + l+)}. The
integration also covers all the other vortices.

In this work, we focus on the motion of vortices at zero
temperature in the absence of any normal ﬂuid which al-
lows us to neglect mutual friction that would otherwise
act on the vortices [11]; in practice, this regime refers to
helium-4 experiments at temperatures below 1 K. Above
this temperature, mutual friction acts to damp Kelvin
waves along vortex ﬁlaments. Without the normal com-
ponent, the dynamics of the vortices are equivalent to
the motion of vortices in a classical ideal ﬂuid but with
the constraint that the circulation is quantized in units
of h/m4 where m4 is the atomic mass of 4He.

A Kelvin wave is a helical perturbation of a straight
vortex. We choose our coordinate system such that the
principal axis of the ﬁlament is aligned along the z axis.
Since for a helix, the x and y coordinates are single-valued
functions of the z coordinate, we can introduce a complex
function

w(z) = x(z) + iy(z).

(2)
Then the equation of a helical vortex is given by w(z) =
A exp(i(kz + φ)). Here A is the amplitude of the wave, k
is the wavenumber, and φ is a phase that determines the
orientation of the helix. For an inﬁnitely long straight
vortex, k is any real number. In this work, we will sim-
ulate vortices in a domain with periodic boundary con-
ditions along the z coordinate direction. In this case, al-
lowable wavenumbers correspond to k = 2πm/Lz, where
m is an integer and Lz is the period along z.

In general, a single-valued curve can be expressed as a

linear combination of Kelvin waves

conﬁguration is a helical vortex with mode 5 and amplitude
A0 = 0.015 mm wound around a straigth vortex. The length
of the z period is Lz = 1 mm. Vortex conﬁgurations are
shown at times 0 s, 0.007 s, 0.014 s and 0.021 s. The scaling
of the axis is chosen to emphasize the helical wave.

This allows us to decompose a general helical perturba-
tion in terms of its fourier modes and thereby evaluate
the Kelvin wave spectrum. Since Kelvin waves can be
quantized [24], we refer to the elementary excitations on
a vortex as kelvons. The kelvon occupation number spec-
trum is then deﬁned as

n(k) = |wk|2 + |w−k|2,

k > 0.

(4)

The vortex conﬁgurations considered will typically
have a single Kelvin wave mode. The phase of the vor-
tex can then be obtained by simply tracking the location
of point z = 0 in the computational domain that spans
the interval 0 ≤ z ≤ Lz. The phase of the Kelvin wave
is deﬁned as the azimuthal angle of that point in the
xy plane. On the other hand, the amplitude of the wave
is determined by ﬁtting a circle to the projection of the
vortex on the xy plane; the radius of that circle being the
amplitude A. One advantage of this method is that it is
also applicable to localized wavepackets, and localized
nonlinear excitations such as Hasimoto solitons [25]. We
have tested that our method for determining the phase
and amplitude is consistent with ﬁnding them by using
a Fast Fourier Transform.

For a helical vortex, the dimensionless product Ak is
an important parameter.
It appears in the dispersion
relation of a Kelvin wave of arbitrary amplitude (derived
using the local induction approximation) [26, 27]:

from the intrinsic nonlocal dynamics of the Biot-Savart
law. The phenomena we describe cannot be described us-
ing the so-called Local Induction Approximation which
retains only the ﬁrst term in Eq. (1).

During the evolution, the momentum (or, more pre-

cisely, the impulse) of the vortices deﬁned as

is conserved. Here ρs is the superﬂuid density and the
integral is performed over the interval 0 ≤ z ≤ Lz. The
z component of the momentum (i.e. along the vortex) is
proportional to the product of the area of the projection
of the vortex line onto the xy plane times the mode num-
ber, i.e. the number of times the vortex winds around the
axis within one period. From this, we can determine the
√
instants when the amplitude of the Kelvin waves of each
vortex are equal. This should occur when A = A0/
2
(where A0 is the initial amplitude). This is conﬁrmed in
the results presented in Fig. 2.

We have found that the leapfrogging motion of Kelvin
waves is a robust eﬀect, which occurs even if we add
some random white noise to the initial conﬁguration.
Fig. 3 shows the evolution of a Kelvin wave on a vor-
tex to which we added some noise with magnitude equal
to 2 percent of the original amplitude. It is clear that
even after more than ten recurrence periods we can still

where Λ is the logarithmic prefactor of the ﬁrst term con-
taining ˆs(cid:48) × s(cid:48)(cid:48) in Eq. (1). The inclusion of mutual fric-
tion or counterﬂow would change the dispersion relation
[27]. The motion of a helical vortex is purely rotational
when Ak → 0.
If Ak → ∞, then the motion is pure
translation along the vortex axis. We will use the condi-
tion Ak = 1 to distiguish small amplitude Kelvin waves
(Ak < 1) from large amplitude Kelvin waves (Ak > 1).

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS FOR SMALL

AMPLITUDE KELVIN WAVES

Let us consider two coaxial vortices, one straight and
one with a Kelvin wave. Subsequent integration of Eq.
(1) with such an initial condition reveals that a Kelvin
wave with the same wave number as that initially present
on the perturbed vortex will grow on the initially straight
vortex. This is compensated by a decrease in the ampli-
tude of the initially perturbed vortex until it becomes
straight. The cycle then continues resulting in a recur-
rence as can be seen in Fig. 1. For dynamics, see SM
[28].

When the vortices are viewed along their common axis,
they appear as vortex rings passing through one another.
We, therefore, refer to this behaviour as ‘leapfrogging
Kelvin waves’. This recurrent motion is easy to see if
we consider the amplitudes of the vortices as the func-
tions of time (see Fig. 2). We note that the exchange of
energy that is associated with the hopping of the Kelvin

connection would increase the vortex length and thus not
be energetically favorable.

The upper panel of Fig. 7 shows that for vortices with
small amplitude Kelvin waves, the recurrence time de-
pends only very weakly on the wavelength of the Kelvin
wave. If we ignore the wavelength, then A0 and κ are the
only relevant dimensional parameters in the system and
they can be combined to identify a relevant timescale. In-
deed, the recurrence time τ seems to be proportional to
0/κ for a given phase diﬀerence (see Fig. 6). In Fig. 6,
A2
we included only numerical simulations with very small
amplitudes for practical computational reasons. How-
ever, in Fig. 7 we can see that when Ak is close to unity,
the recurrence time is no longer proportional to A2

0/κ.

tial conﬁguration is two vortices with equal amplitude Kelvin
waves (m = 1, Lz = 20 mm). The diﬀerent lines are
for diﬀerent phase diﬀerences (blue circles π/2, red squares
5π/12, green diamonds π/3 and yellow triangles π/4). Solid
lines are from the model, points from simulations. Ampli-
tudes are between 0.1 mm and 0.6 mm (this corresponds to
A0k = 0.031, . . . , 0.19, so we are clearly in the small amplitude
regime). It is clear that τ ∝ A2
0/κ, but the proportionality
coeﬃcient depends on the phase diﬀerence.

diﬀerence is ∆φ = π/3, and when the vortices have equal

m = 5, Lz = 1 mm is shown in the inset. In this case the
vortices do not straighten completely.

see the initial Kelvin mode, conﬁrming the persistence of
the leapfrogging behaviour for initially perturbed Kelvin
waves. We have also tested the stability to sideband
modes (m − 1 and m + 1) with small amplitudes, and
found that such a perturbation did not destroy the re-
currence of the leapfrogging.

We note that for the leapfrogging to take place, it is not
necessary for one of the vortices to be initially straight.
Leapfrogging occurs whenever the coaxial vortices have
the same Kelvin wave mode. If the vortices initially have
equal amplitudes (an example is shown in Fig. 4), then
the minimum and maximum amplitudes Amin and Amax
will depend on the phase diﬀerence (see Fig. 5). We
observe that the amplitude tends to zero, i.e. the vor-
tex straightens, only when the phase diﬀerence tends to
π/2 (as in Fig. 2). The minimum and maximum am-
plitudes are symmetric with respect to π/2 while the re-
currence time τ increases as the phase diﬀerence is in-
creased. If the phase diﬀerence is 0 < ∆φ ≤ π/2 when
the vortices have equal amplitudes, then the phase dif-
ference oscillates around 0 (as can be seen from Figs. 2
and 4). In contrast, when the amplitudes are equal and
π/2 < ∆φ < π, the phase diﬀerence oscillates around π.
It is remarkable that throughout the leapfrogging pro-
cess, the two helical vortices do not cross and reconnect.
If the phase diﬀerence is small when the vortices have
equal amplitudes, they come really close to each other
(∆φ cannot be exactly zero, since then the vortices would
coincide). Even then the reconnection does not happen
easily. This is because the vortices are parallel, and re-

NEARLY PARALLEL VORTICES

We have seen that helical vortices can be expressed
in the form of Eq. (2).
If the amplitude is small, the
helices are nearly parallel to the z axis. In this case, it
is possible to describe the motion of the vortices using
simpliﬁed equations that account for the interaction of
nearly parallel vortex ﬁlaments as given in [29]. This
model essentially combines a local induction approxima-
tion (LIA) with a nonlocal term for the interaction of two
essentially straight line vortices.

To provide a systematic but more straightfoward
derivation of this model, we will begin by considering
the Hamiltonian formulation of the Biot-Savart law as
given in [9]. In particular, we recall that the Biot-Savart
law conserves energy as given by

From this deﬁnition for the energy, it follows that for
a ﬁlament that can be parameterized in terms of the z
coordinate, the Hamiltonian can be expressed as

Since the integrand in the above expression for H is sin-

We have approximated the logarithmic factor to be
constant, and for helium-4 its value in typical experi-
ments is Λ (cid:39) 12. We remark that since LIA ignores all
nonlocal interactions it alone cannot explain the interac-
tion between the two vortices. The model above is based
on similar assumptions to those considered in [29]. The
nonlocal interactions, varying along z, are approximated
to be similar to those of two straight line vortices. An
intuitive explanation for the above form of the Hamilto-
nian is that since the vortices are almost straight their
respective self-induced velocities must be very small. On
the other hand, since each vortex is also nearly paral-
lel to the z axis, the velocity it induces on the other, is
inversely proportional to their separation.

where B and C are real constants with units of length.
Without loss of generality, we can restrict B and C to
be positive since the negative values can be encoded
within the phases θu and θv. Alternatively, we can set
θu = θv = 0 because these constants will simply shift
the origin of the graphs for the amplitudes and phases.
In principle, the wavenumber k could be diﬀerent for u
and v, but the case with the same k is relevant for the
leapfrogging Kelvin waves that is the focus of this work.

In III, we arrived at the proportionality τ ∝ A2
0/κ from
dimensional reasoning. In Fig. 6 we show τ as a func-
tion of A2
0/κ, where A0 corresponds to the value of the
amplitude at the instant when the respective amplitudes
of the Kelvin waves of both vortices become equal. This

is true because τ ∝ B2 where B =(cid:112)4A2

This model gives very good agreement to the results of
our numerical simulations of the vortex ﬁlament model.
We note that since B and C determine the phase dif-
ference, τ also depends on ∆φ as observed in our sim-
ulations.
In Fig. 2, the results of both the numerical
simulation and the solution of the model are shown. The
time scale of the recurrence diﬀers slightly. Since our nu-
merical simulations are obtained by integrating the full
Biot–Savart law, we attribute the diﬀerence in timescales
to the approximations made in arriving at Eq. (15).

V. LARGE AMPLITUDE KELVIN WAVES

If the amplitude is increased, so that Ak > 1, then
there is a clear change in the behaviour (see Fig. 7, lower
panel). If the Kelvin wave amplitude of one of the vor-
tices is suﬃciently large in comparision with the other,
then the amplitudes of the waves on the vortices might
never coincide with one another. In this case, the am-
plitudes of the Kelvin waves in each vortex will oscillate
within diﬀerent ranges (see Fig. 8 and SM [28]).

In order to explain the diﬀerence between the case of
small amplitudes and the case of large amplitudes, it is
useful to draw the following analogy. If we consider two
coaxial vortex rings, it is possible that one of the rings es-
capes and no leapfrogging occurs. In the case of Kelvin
waves, there is no direct analogy to this eﬀect, so we
must consider two rows of coaxial vortex rings instead
of just two vortex rings. Now there are two possibilities.
The ﬁrst possibility takes place if rings of the inner row
leapfrog with corresponding rings of the outer row. This
scenario is analogous to leapfrogging of small amplitude
Kelvin waves. The analogy then allows us to associate
the amplitude and wavelength of the Kelvin wave to the

Figure 8. Amplitudes and phase diﬀerence (inset) as func-
tions of time. Initially one of the vortices was straight and
the other vortex had a Kelvin wave (m = 1, A0 = 0.5 mm,
Lz = 2.5 mm). In the large amplitude regime, the amplitudes
will oscillate within diﬀerent ranges.

Kelvin wave amplitudes and wavelengths will not behave
in exactly the same way.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We have shown that coaxial vortices with the same
Kelvin wave mode exchange energy in a periodic fashion.
The helical vortices move through each other in a way
that is similar to leapfrogging vortex rings. In the small
amplitude limit, the amplitudes of the two helical waves
oscillate within the same range. In contrast, in the large
amplitude limit, the amplitudes oscillate around two dif-
ferent mean values, although leapfrogging continues to
occur in a periodic fashion.

Using a simpliﬁed model for nearly parallel vortices,
we were able to explain the leapfrogging behaviour ob-
served in our Biot–Savart simulations in the limit of
small-amplitude Kelvin waves. The success of the model
in this regime suggests that it may be possible to gener-
alize it to other contexts, most notably in studying how
adjacent vortex ﬁlaments can inﬂuence the theoretically
predicted Kelvin wave cascades in the high wavenumber
regime of superﬂuid turbulence. For example, such a sce-
nario would be relevant to understanding Kelvin waves
on polarized vortex bundles that are believed to form in
superﬂuid turbulence.

In the large amplitude Kelvin wave regime, there is
a qualitative change in the dynamical behaviour of the
vortices. We have been able to interpret this by drawing
an analogy with the dynamics of coaxial rows of vortex
rings. We end by noting that the phenomena predicted
here will also contribute to our understanding of the dy-
namics of vortices and their interaction in classical ﬂuids.

Figure 7. Extra length due to Kelvin wave as function of time.
In all simulations there is one initially straigth vortex and one
with Kelvin wave (m = 1, A0 = 0.5 mm). The length of the z
period is varied between diﬀerent runs which corresponds to
a variation in the wavelength of the Kelvin wave. Only the
length of the initially straight vortex is plotted.
Top: For all of the small amplitude cases (A0k < 1 or
Lz > 2πA0 = π mm) the recurrence time is almost the same.
Deviations are most visible when A0k ∼ 1.
Bottom: For A0k > 1 (or Lz < 2πA0 = π mm) the recur-
rence times do not follow the same pattern as for the long
wavelengths. For Lz ≤ 3 mm the amplitudes of the two vor-
tices are never equal.

radius of the rings and the distance between consecu-
tive rings on the same row, respectively. Moreover, the
phase diﬀerence at the instant when the amplitudes of
the vortices are equal, is related to the distance between
the rings in the two rows at the moment when they have
equal radii).

For the scenario of large amplitude Kelvin waves, the
analogy with two coaxial rows of vortex rings implies
that a qualitatively diﬀerent behaviour is expected. In
this case, if the ring in the inner row escapes the corre-
sponding outer ring, its radius may increase some time
until it approaches the next ring in the outer row. Then
the inner ring shrinks and passes through the outer ring,
and this cycle repeats. This analogy can provide a qual-
itative interpretation for the change in leapfrogging of
Kelvin waves between small amplitudes and large ampli-
tudes. Furthermore, it provides an explanation for the
sudden qualitative diﬀerence in the recurrence phenom-
ena as the amplitudes are increased. However, care must
be taken not to push this analogy too far as it cannot
provide accurate quantitative predictions. In particular,
rings having amplitudes and distances that are similar to
