Abstract

In November 2015, El Salvador reported their ﬁrst case of Zika virus (Zv) leading to
an explosive outbreak that in just two months had over 6000 suspected cases. Many com-
munities along with national agencies initiated the process to implement control measures
that ranged from vector control and the use of repellents to the suggestion of avoiding preg-
nancies for two years, the latter one, in response to the growing number of microcephaly
cases in Brazil. In our study, we explore the impact of short term mobility between two
idealized interconnected communities where disparities and violence contribute to the Zv
epidemic. Using a Lagrangian modeling approach in a two-patch setting, it is shown via
simulations that short term mobility may be beneﬁcial in the control of a Zv outbreak
when risk is relative low and patch disparities are not too extreme. However, when the
reproductive number is too high, there seems to be no beneﬁts.

1 Introduction

Zika virus (Zv), an emerging mosquito-borne ﬂavivirus related to yellow fever, dengue, West Nile
and Japanese encephalitis [17], has taken the Americas by a storm. Zv is transmitted primarily
by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which also transmits dengue and chikungunya, are responsible for
huge outbreaks in some regions in Brazil, Colombia, and El Salvador. Zv cases as of February
9, 2016, according to the CDC [6], have been reported throughout the Caribbean, Mexico as
well as in most South American nations except for Chile, Uruguay, Argentina, Paraguay and
Peru. Several states within the United States have reported Zv cases[23] and although it is
expected that Zv will be managed within the USA, the possibility of localized Zv outbreaks is
not out of the question.

Phylogenetic analyses have revealed the existence of two main virus lineages (African and
Asian) [15, 16]. Up to date, there are no concise clinical diﬀerences between infections with
either one of these two lineages. This is in part due to the few human isolates belonging to
the African lineage which were mainly obtained from sentinel rhesus in 1947 in Uganda, where
it was ﬁrst discovered during primate and mosquito surveillance for Yellow Fever [11]. Its ge-
ographic habitat at that time was tied in to narrow equatorial belt running across Africa and
into Asia. The African lineage circulated primarily in wild primates and arboreal mosquitoes
such as Aedes africanus; spillover infections in humans rarely occurred even in areas were it was
found to be highly enzootic [21, 14]. The more geographically expanded Asian lineage seems
to have originated from the adaptation of the virus to invade a diﬀerent vector, Aedes aegypti,
which unfortunately seems to be perfectly adapted to infect humans [16, 14]. The ﬁrst human
infection was reported in Nigeria in 1954 [20].
In 2007, Zika moved out of Africa and Asia
causing an outbreak in Yap Island in the Federated States of Micronesia [12], this was followed
by a large outbreak in French Polynesia in 2013-2014 [4] and then spreading to New Caledo-
nia, the Cook Islands and Eastern Islands [22]. Some evidence exists regarding Zika spread
following chikungunya epizootics and epidemics as African researchers observed this decades
ago. This pattern was also present in 2013 when chikungunya pandemic spread from west to
east followed by Zika [14]. In early 2015, Zv was detected in Brazil. Phylogenetic analyses of
the virus isolated from patients placed the Brazilian strains in the Asian lineage [27], which has
been previously detected during the French Polynesian outbreak [5]. Since the ﬁrst detection
of Zv in Brazil, the following countries have reported ongoing substantial transmission of Zv in
South America: Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guyana, Guyana, Paraguay, Suri-
name and Venezuela [9]. Several Central America countries are also aﬀected including Costa
Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama [10]. The rapid expansion of
Zv has led the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare it a public health emergency of
international concern [26].

It has been estimated that about 80% of persons infected with Zv are asymptomatic [12, 7] and
it is known that those with clinical manifestations present dengue-like symptoms that include
arthralgia, particularly swelling, mild fever, lymphadenopathy, skin rash, headaches, retro or-
bital pain and conjunctivitis which normally last for 2-7 days [27, 26, 7]. Due to the similarity
in clinical characteristics between dengue, chikungunya and Zv, the lack of widely distributed
Zv-speciﬁc tests, the high proportion of asymptomatic individuals, it may turn out that the
number of patients infected with Zv may actually be a lot higher than what it is being reported
[14, 24]. Moreover, co-infection with dengue and Zv is not uncommon. In fact, it has been
previously reported making Zv diagnosis even more diﬃcult[13].

The challenges linked to the control of Zv must include the fact that there is no vaccine available,
a troublesome situation given the fact that Zv has been linked recently to potential neurological
(microcephaly) and auto-immune (Guillain-Barré syndrome) complications. Further the evi-
dence so far points to the likelihood that Zv can also be sexually transmitted [8, 26]. Education
about Zv modes of transmission and ways of preventing transmission are essential in order to
halt mosquito growth and thus Zv spread at the community, population, regional, national and
global levels. Control measures available are limited and include the use of insect repellents
to protect us against mosquito bites and sex abstinence or protection while engage in sexual
activity [8]. Some countries face immense challenges that if not addressed would make current
eﬀorts by oﬃcials to educate the public highly ineﬀective. And additional challenges that may
limit if not stop the use of whatever control or education measures that a city, or nation or
region may be able to put in place, are tied in to the eﬀectiveness of public safety, violence and

2

organized crime activity (including gangs). The Latin America and the Caribbean population
comprise only 9% of the global population and yet, it accounts for 33% of the world’s homicides
[18]. In this study, we analyze the impact of that restrictions to public safety may have in the
control of Zv. The motivation comes from our interest in addressing the role of violence and
insecurity within the context of the Caribbean, particularly El Salvador.

2 Derivation of the model

As speciﬁed in the introduction, the objective of this manuscript is to look at the impact of
mobility and security on the transmission dynamics of the Zika virus (Zv), in regions where
insecurity, violence and resource limitations make it diﬃcult to implement eﬀective intervention
eﬀorts. As a ﬁrst step, we proceed to build a two-patch model, both patches deﬁned by their
relationship to security and associated per capita resources. And so, the ﬁrst patch is deﬁned
by low level security, which makes it diﬃcult to have access and carry out systematic vector
control eﬀorts due, for example, to gang activity. The second patch a safe territory, that is, a
place where security is high, access to health services is expected, and relative high levels of
education are the norm.

Building detailed parametrized models that account for all the above factors would require
tremendous amount of data and information and so, the model would require a large number of
parameters, some that have never been measured. Its use as a policy simulation tool would also
require impressive amounts of information on, for example, individuals’ daily scheduled activi-
ties. Here, it is assumed, that each patch is made up of individuals all experiencing the same
degree of risk to infection. It is also assumed that all individuals are typical representatives
of either the high risk (Patch1) or low risk (Patch 2) communities. The level of risk (violence
and infection) is incorporated within a single parameter ˆβi, i = 1, 2 and so, by deﬁnition, we
have in general that ˆβ1 ≫ ˆβ2. This assumption captures in a rather simplistic way the essence
of what we want to address, namely, the fact that we are looking at the dynamics of Zv in a
highly heterogeneous world, modeled, for the purpose of exploring its role, in as simple scenario
as possible. Here we look at an extreme case where the situation, idealistically deﬁned via two
patches; a high and a low risk patch. The dynamics of individuals in both patches, short time
scales are incorporated. The analysis is over the duration of a single outbreak.

In the rest of this section, we introduce the prototypic model that will be used to model Zv
dynamics within a patch. And so, we let Nh denote the host patch population size interacting
with a vector population of size Nv. The transmission process is model through the interactions
of the following epidemiological state variables. And so, we let Sh, Eh, Ih,a, Ih,s and Rh denote
the susceptible, latent, infectious asymptomatic, infectious symptomatic and recovered sub-
populations, respectively while Sv, Ev and Iv are used to denote the susceptible, latent and
infectious mosquito sub-populations. Since the focus is on a single outbreak, we neglect the
hosts’ demography while assuming that the vector’s demography does not change, this is done,
by simply assuming that the birth and death per capita mosquito rates are the same. New
reports point [7, 12] to the identiﬁcation of an increasing number of asymptomatic infectious
individuals from ongoing Zv outbreaks. And so, we consider two classes of infectious Ih,a and
Ih,s, asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals. Furthermore, since not much is known about
the dynamics of Zv transmission, we assume that Ih,a and Ih,s individuals are equally infectious
and that their periods of infectiousness are roughly the same. This is not a terrible assumption
given our current knowledge of Zv epidemiology and the fact that in general Zv infections are

3

not severe. Furthermore, since the infectious process of Zv is similar to dengue we proceed to
use parameter estimates for dengue transmission in El Salvador [14, 24] as well as our current
estimates of the basic reproduction number for Zv obtained from the data on Barranquilla’s
Colombia current Zv outbreak [25]. The selection of model parameters ranges beneﬁted from
those estimated from the 2013-2014 French Polynesia outbreak [19]. The dynamics of the
prototypic single patch system, single epidemic outbreak, is modeled via the following nonlinear
system of diﬀerential equations:

Figure 1: Flow diagram of the model

The parameters of Model 1 are collected and described in Table 1 while the ﬂow diagram of the
model is provided in Fig 1. We now proceed to compute the formula for the basic reproduction
number for this prototypic model, that is, the average number of secondary infections generated
by a typical infectious individual in a population where nobody has experienced a Zv-infection.
That is, we take S(0) = Nh, that is, we focus on perturbations of the disease free equilibrium
of Model (1), that is, on E0 = (Nh, 0, 0, 0, 0). And so, using standard approaches, we ﬁnd that
the basic reproduction number is given by

is the average number of secondary cases produced by a symtptomatic infectious during their

ratio and the infectiousness of humans to mosquitoes, ˆβ = bβvh

0 > 1 we have that the
host population experiences an outbreak, that is, the number of cases exceeds the initial size
of the introduced infected population at time t = 0. When R2
0 > 1, the population of infected
individuals eventually decreases and the disease dies out (single outbreak model).

In short, if R2

In the next section, a two patch model using a Lagrangian approach found in [1, 3] is introduced.
And so, individual in Patch i, i = 1, 2 never loose their residency status. The mobility of patch,
residents visiting other patches is modeled by the use of a residence times matrix. Each entry
models the proportion of time that each resident spends in his own patch or as a visitor, every
day. We make use of the 2 × 2 matrix P, with entries pij, i, j = 1, 2; pi1 + pi,2 = 1, i = 1, 2.
Parameters speciﬁc to El Salvador are used and the most recent estimates of R0 for Zv we

5

explore, via simulations, the consequences of mobility, modeled by the matrix P, the impact
that the diﬀerences in risk, captured on the assumption ˆβ1 ≫ ˆβ2, have on the transmission of
Zv by asymptomatic and symptomatic infectious individuals.

3 Heterogeneity through residence times

The role of mobility between two communities, within the same city, living under dramatically
distinct health, economic, social and security settings is now explored using as simple model as
possible. We need two patches, the inclusion of within- and across-patches vector-host trans-
mission, and the ability of each individual to ‘move’ without loosing, within the model, its place
of residence. We consider two highly distinct patches. Patch 1 with access to health facilities,
regular security, resources and eﬀective public health policies, while Patch 2 lacks nearly every-
thing. Within this highly simpliﬁed setting, the diﬀerences in risk, which depend on host vector
ratios, biting rates, use of repellents, access to vector control crews and more, are captured by
assuming dramatic diﬀerences in transmission; all captured by the single parameter ˆβ. It is
therefore assumed that ˆβ1 ≫ ˆβ2, where ˆβi deﬁnes the risk in patch i, i = 1, 2 [high risk Patch 1
and low risk Patch 2].

The two-patch Lagrangian model makes use of a host population stratiﬁed by epidemiological
classes indexed by residence patch, that is, we let Sh, Eh, Ih,a, Ih,s and Rh denote the suscep-
tible, latent, infectious asymptomatic, infectious symptomatic and recovered sub-populations,
respectively while Sv, Ev and Iv denote the susceptible, latent and infectious mosquito sub-
populations. Again, Nh denotes the host patch population size and Nv the total vector popula-
tion in each patch. It is further assumed, a reasonable assumption in the case of Aedes aegypti,
that the the vector does not travel between patches. The single-patch model-parameters are
collected and described in Table 1 while the ﬂow diagram of the single-patch dynamics model,
when residents and visitors do not move; that is, when the 2 × 2 residence times matrix P is
such that p11 = p22 = 1, are captured in Fig 1

The 2 × 2 residence matrix P with entries pij, i, j = 1, 2, pi1 + pi,2 = 1, i = 1, 2, where pij
denotes the proportion of the day that a resident of Patch i spends in Patch j, i = 1, 2, deﬁnes
host-mobility, Lagrangian approach used here. The use of this approach, under the assumption
that vectors do not move [1], has consequences. For example, it leads to the conclusion that
at time t, the population on each patch does not necessarily have to be equal to the number
of residents in that patch, in other words, the eﬀective population patch size must account for
residents and visitors at each patch at time t. The speciﬁcs of the model are now provided
following the work of Bichara et al. [1, 2].

3.1 Two patch model

Following our recently developed version of residence patch models [1, 2, 3], leads to the follow-
ing two patch model where P = (pij) and pi,j represents the residence time that an individual
from Patch i spends in Patch j; i = 1, 2.

And so, we proceed to make use of the disparity between patches assumption, captured by the
inequality, ˆβ1 ≫ ˆβ2, where ˆβi is directly proportional to the local basic reproduction number or
R0i, i = 1, 2, which deﬁnes the risk in patch i, i = 1, 2, [high risk Patch 1 and low risk Patch 2]
under idealized, that is, no mobility conditions. Changes in the entries of P lead to changes in
the global basic reproduction number, R0, which naturally impact for example, the long-term
dynamics of Zv in the two-patch system. It impacts the overall ﬁnal epidemic size as well as the
residents prevalence within each patch. A possible scenarios that allow us to explore the role
that mobility, P and local risk, R0i have on global risk (R0) and on the prevalence of infections
among the residents of each patch are explored via simulations.

4 Simulations

Simulations are used to assess the impact of local mobility, on the dynamics of Zv, between
two close communities. The ﬁrst heavily aﬀected by violence, poverty and lack of resources and
a second with access to public health vector control measures, health facilities, resources and
the ability to minimize crime and violence. We assume the high risk community (Patch 1) is
at a higher risk of acquiring Zv; this risk will be manifested through higher biting rates and a
higher vector-host ratio leading well captured with a high reproductive number.
The simulations of this idealized world considers two scenarios for Patch 1, the ﬁrst deﬁned by a
high local basic reproductive number, R01 = 3 and the second by taking R01 = 1.5, both within
the ranges of previous Zv outbreaks [25, 19]. It is assumed that in the absence of mobility,
Patch 2 would be unable to support a Zv outbreak and since its mobility-free reproductive
number is assumed to be R02 = 0.9. It is further assumed that mobility from Patch 2 into
Patch 1 is unappealing due to, for example, high levels of violent activity in Patch 1. And so,
individuals from Patch 2 spend on average a a limited amount of their day in Patch 1; thus for
our baseline simulations we take p21 = 0.10.
Figure 2, shows the proliferation of the outbreak as a result of mobility when we assume the
reproduction number from the current Barranquilla outbreak (R01 = 3) [25]. Both the incidence
and ﬁnal size of Patch 1 and Patch 2 increase for all the mobility values tested.

mobility values (around 0.6 or greater) for which Patch 1 beneﬁts from mobility. Nonetheless,
this reduction on the ﬁnal size of Patch 1 is not signiﬁcant enough to have a positive eﬀect on
the outcome of the global ﬁnal size.

Figure 3: Proportion of incidence and proportion of ﬁnal infected individuals in Patch 1 and
Patch 2, for traveling times p21 = 0.10 and p12 = 0, 0.20, 0.40 and 0.60. There is no signiﬁcant
change in Patch 1, but a notable increment of the ﬁnal size in Patch 2. R01 = 1.5 and R02 = 0.9.

Analysis of the Final size as a function of residence times (mobility values) show, in Figure 4,
the aforementioned behavior along with a change in behavior for the case where R01 = 1.5.
Furthermore, the global reproductive number R0 is reduced for almost all mobility values
compared to the zero mobility case.
It is important to notice that the global reproductive
number never drops below 1, meaning that for these two particular cases (R01 = 1.5, 3), mobility
is not enough to bring R0 < 1.

Figure 4: Local and global ﬁnal sizes through mobility values when p21 = 0.10. Although
mobility reduces the global R0, allowing mobility in the case of El Salvador (R0 = 2) leads to
a detrimental eﬀect in the global ﬁnal size.

Figure 5, suggests that a small change in the local basic reproductive number of the high
risk Patch, is able to drive a considerable change in the behavior of the cumulative ﬁnal size.
Meaning that the eﬀective implementation of control measures along with speciﬁc mobility
patters could have a beneﬁcial impact on the outcome of the epidemic.

Figure 5: Global ﬁnal size through mobility values when p21 = 0.10. R2
0 is ﬁxed to 0.9,
meanwhile R01 is varied. R01 = 1.5 shows an interval of residence times that reduces the ﬁnal
size.

Finally, we wanted to study the eﬀect produced by the population size from Patch 2 in the
cumulative ﬁnal size and the global R0. Figure 6 summarize the mobility eﬀects for both
scenarios R01 = 3 and R01 = 1.5, while R02 = 0.9 and N1 = 10000. In both scenarios, the
eﬀect of mobility is adverse when N1 ≈ N2, however when N1 ≫ N2, it is possible to ﬁnd a set
of residence times (around 0.20) that reduces the cumulative ﬁnal size in comparison with the
zero movement case.

Figure 6: Cumulative ﬁnal size and global R0 under mobility (p21 = 0.10) and population
proportions eﬀects. When N1 ≫ N2, it is possible to ﬁnd a set of residence times (around 0.20)
that reduces the cumulative ﬁnal size in comparison with the zero movement case

On the other hand, the global R0 is being reduced considerably when N1 ≈ N2, while for the
case N1 ≫ N2 the global R0 remains almost equal.
For the two epidemiological scenarios R01 = 3 and R01 = 1.5, tables 2 and 3 show a summary
of the average proportion of infected population when low (p12 = 0 − 0.32), intermediate
(p12 = 0.33 − 0.65) and high mobility (p12 = 0.66 − 0.99) is allowed for p21 = 0.10. A ﬁxed
population size for Patch 1 N1 = 10000 and diﬀerent population sizes for Patch 2 are considered
N2 = 1000, 3000, 5000, 7000 and the case N1 = N2 = 10000.

Figure 7 shows the global R0 over all mobility values for diﬀerent population sizes of Patch 2,
for the two epidemic scenarios. The minimum R0 value is reached for all cases when mobility
is at 90% and this value is being reduced when N1 ≈ N2. The global R0 is dominated by the
local R01, this is, the local R0 of the high risk Patch.

Figure 7: Global R0 dynamics through mobility when p21 = 0.10. Patch 2 populations are
varied from N2 = 1000, 3000, 5000, 7000 up to 10000. The global R0 hits its minimum always
at 90% of mobility and as N1 ≈ N2 this minimum value is decreasing.

5 Conclusions

This manuscript looks at the role of mobility in an idealized setting involving two adjacent
highly distinct communities. The ﬁrst community has the resources and means to control a
Zv outbreak (R02 < 1) while the second faces dramatic limitations, R01, very large, or strong
limitations R01, large. We also explored the role of density by assuming that N1 = kN2 with k
=1,..,10. Each simulation looks at the role of the mobility matrix P, the global R0, and local
R0i, i=1,2. On the local and overall prevalence of Zv. We verify the expected results, density
matters, the global R0 has a minimum value, which depends on the entries of the mobility
matrix P, and R01, very large is a lot worse than R01 large. We also see that unless movement
is dramatically reduced that there is no hope that Zv can be contained. Certainly, stopping
mobility would lead to the elimination of Zv in Patch 2. By stopping mobility would bring
the economy to a halt, in this idealized two-world community. Naturally, the set up is not
representative of any real situation. The model could be easily modiﬁed to include the type of
heterogeneity found in ‘real’ communities. The dynamics of Zv in places where violence is high
due to gangs or other type of criminal activities, would be no doubt, make it nearly impossible
to eliminate Zv.
