ON THE COMPUTATION OF TORUS LINK HOMOLOGY

BEN ELIAS AND MATTHEW HOGANCAMP

ABSTRACT. We introduce a new method for computing triply graded link homology, which is
particularly well-adapted to torus links. Our main application is to the (n, n)-torus links, for
which we give an exact answer for all n. In several cases, our computations verify conjectures
of Gorsky et al relating homology of torus links with Hilbert schemes.

1. INTRODUCTION

Triply-graded Khovanov-Rozansky homology is a link homology theory which was orig-
inally introduced by Khovanov-Rozansky [KR08] using matrix factorizations, but was soon
after reinterpreted by Khovanov [Kho07a] using the Hochschild homology of Soergel bimod-
ules. It has generated a great deal of interest, admitting spectral sequences which converge
to various sln-link homology theories [Ras15], and having deep connections to the represen-
tation theory of Hecke algebras in type A.

Khovanov’s construction begins with a braid β on n strands. To such a braid, Rouquier
[Rou] has associated a complex (up to homotopy) F (β) of Soergel bimodules, which are
certain graded bimodules [Soe07] over the polynomial ring R = Rn = Q[x1, . . . , xn] in n
variables. More precisely, Rouquier associates a complex to each braid generator (e.g. over-
or under-crossing). From this, one obtains a complex for any braid diagram by taking the
tensor product of these elementary complexes. Rouquier proves that two braid diagrams for
the same braid yield complexes which are canonically isomorphic in the homotopy category
of R-bimodules.

Khovanov [Kho07b] observed that taking the closure β of a braid β should correspond to
identifying the right and left actions of R, or rather the higher derived functors of this oper-
ation. These higher derived functors are known as Hochschild homology and are denoted
by HHi(R; M ); when R is understood we write HHi(M ) = HHi(R; M ). Khovanov proved
that the complex obtained by applying HHi to each Soergel bimodule in a Rouquier complex
F (β) yields a complex of vector spaces which (up to homotopy) depends only on the closure
β, and thus the homology groups of this complex are link invariants of β. The three grad-
ings come from the Hochschild homological grading, the usual homological grading, and
the internal grading of the Soergel bimodules.

It is well known (see [Kho07b] and references therein) that if R = Rn is a polynomial
ring and M is an R-bimodule, then there is an isomorphism between Hochschild homology
group HHi(R; M ), and the Hochschild cohomology group HHn−i(R; M ). The Hochshild co-
homology groups are the the higher derived functors of M (cid:55)→ Hom(R,R)(R, M ), the space of
R-bimodule maps from the monoidal identity R. For the remainder of this paper, we work
exclusively with Hochschild cohomology.

The Khovanov-Rozansky homology of torus links has deep connections to Hilbert schemes,
rational Cherednik algebras, and reﬁned Chern-Simons theory [GORS14; GN15; GNR]. At
the moment these connections are purely conjectural, but they suggest that the Khovanov-
Rozansky homologies of torus links are quite interesting objects. Up until now, however,
the connection with other subjects has been difﬁcult to verify, since the computation of
Khovanov-Rozansky homology is quite challenging in practice. In this paper we introduce
a new method for computing Khovanov-Rozansky homology which seems particularly well
adapted to compute homologies of torus links. In particular, we provide a remarkably simple
description of the triply-graded homology of the (n, n) torus links, in Theorem 1.6.
In §1.5 we compare our results with the predictions of Gorsky-Negut [GN15] (also Gorsky-
Negut-Rasmussen [GNR]) coming from ﬂag Hilbert schemes; in every case we have checked,
they match identically. Previous checks of the connection with Hilbert schemes have been
limited to the cases n = 2, 3, but with our method we are able to verify the predictions of
loc. cit. for n ≤ 4.

On the other hand, it is difﬁcult to compare our results on (n, n) torus links with the
conjectures of Gorsky-Oblomkov-Rasmussen-Shende [GOR13] since they focus on the case
of the (n, m)-torus knots, that is, when n and m are coprime, and much less is known about

ON THE COMPUTATION OF TORUS LINK HOMOLOGY

3

the link case. Nonetheless, from P. Etingof we learned that the ring of k-quasi-invariants for
Sn acting on Q[x1, . . . , xn] (see [ES] for a survey) is a representation of the rational Cherednik
algebra for sln, and is the correct replacement for the simple module Lm/n which appears in
[GORS14] when m = kn. Thus, the minimal Hochschild degree part of the Poincar´e series
of the (n, nk) torus links is expected to equal the Hilbert series for a certain ﬁltration on the
ring of k-quasi-invariants. However, it is not clear how to ﬁlter the ring of quasi-invariants
in an appropriate way, so we we will not say more about this connection in this paper.

In Appendix A we include some additional computations. We found that the Poincar´e
polynomial of HH0 of the (n, n + 1) torus knot is given by the q, t Catalan number for n =
2, 3, 4, which veriﬁes a conjecture of Gorsky’s [Gor12] for these knots.

Our particular interest in the homology of the (n, n) torus links stems from the fact that
this triply graded vector space parametrizes maps from the identity Soergel bimodule R to
the Rouquier complex associated to the full twist braid FTn. The computation above is used
in forthcoming work of the authors, in which we decompose the Soergel category into its
“eigencategories” for the action of FTn, thereby laying the groundwork for the study of the
categorical representation theory of Hecke algebras.
1.1. Motivation from categorical representation theory. It was shown by Khovanov-Thomas
[KT07] that Rouquier complexes give a faithful action of the braid group on the homotopy
category of Soergel bimodules. For this reason, the collection of Rouquier complexes is often
refered to as a categoriﬁcation of the braid group, but this is somewhat misleading, as this
particular action of the braid group is intricately tied to its Hecke quotient. Soergel [Soe07]
proved that Soergel bimodules over Rn categorify the Hecke algebra H = Hn of the sym-
metric group Sn. Note that H is linear over the ring Z[Q, Q−1], where Q is categoriﬁed by
the grading shift of an R-bimodule1; for this to work correctly, R is graded so that deg xi = 2
for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Taking the image of a Rouquier complex in this Grothendieck group
yields the familiar quotient map from the braid group (or its group algebra over Z[Q, Q−1])
to the Hecke algebra. However, the fact that Rouquier complexes only reﬂect the “Hecke-
type” actions of the braid group is an advantage, not a limitation, as one can lift results from
the representation theory of Hecke algebras to study the homotopy category of Soergel bi-
modules. This paper can be understood and appreciated without a foray into categorical
representation theory, but we provide some brief motivation here.
The Hecke algebra admits a sign representation sgnn, on which each of its standard genera-
tors (the images of the overcrossings) acts by −Q−1. The projection from an arbitrary Hecke
algebra representation to its isotypic component for the sign representation is an idempotent
often known as a (generalized) Jones-Wenzl projector, after the corresponding idempotent
in the Temperley-Lieb algebra [Jon01; Wen87]. This projection can not be deﬁned in H itself,
requiring certain scalars to be inverted (like Q + Q−1, for example). It can be deﬁned in the
base change H ⊗Z[Q,Q−1] Z((Q)).

In [Hogb], the second author constructs an inﬁnite complex of Soergel bimodules Pn
which categoriﬁes this Jones-Wenzl projector. In this paper we study a ﬁnite complex Kn
which categoriﬁes the “renormalized” Jones-Wenzl projector, a rescaling of the projector
which is actually deﬁned within H before base change. The fact that the Jones-Wenzl idem-
potent projects to the sign representation is categoriﬁed by the fact that the Rouquier complex
for an overcrossing, acting by tensor product on Kn, will simply act by a homological and a
grading shift.

1Works of Soergel and those who followed him often work over the ring Z[v, v−1] instead; to compare con-

ventions, use the equality Q = v−1.

The inductive construction of Kn itself also is motivated by the representation theory of
the Hecke algebra. When sgnn is induced from Hn to Hn+1, it splits into two irreducible rep-
resentations, sgnn+1 and another representation V . This splitting is actually the eigenspace
decomposition for the Young-Jucys-Murphy operator yn+1, a certain element of the braid
group on n + 1 strands which commutes with any braid on the ﬁrst n strands. If γ is the
eigenvalue corresponding to V , then yn+1 − γ kills V , and thus is equal to the projection to
sgnn+1 up to scalar. If kn ∈ Hn ⊂ Hn+1 denotes the renormalized projection onto the sign
representation, then by the previous discussion there is a linear relation

kn+1 = knyn+1 − γkn.

On the categorical level, this relation becomes an exact triangle. More precisely, there is
a grading shift Γ and a chain map ϕ : ΓKn → KnF (yn+1) such that Kn+1 := Cone(ϕ)
categoriﬁes the renormalized projection to sgnn+1. Recall that F (yn+1) indicates the Rouquier
complex associated to yn+1. It turns out that γ = Q2, and Γ = Q2 is simply the functor which
shifts internal degree up by 2. This chain map is constructed in [Hogb], and we recall the
basics in §2.6.

This is an example of categorical diagonalization, a concept which is developed in forthcom-
ing work [EH]. The chain map ϕ mentioned above is an eigenmap; in our categoriﬁcation of
various concepts in linear algebra, the cones of eigenmaps are used to categorify the oper-
ators (A − λI) for an eigenvalue λ of an operator A. This makes the computation of HH0
of a braid particularly signiﬁcant, because it describes the space of maps from the (shifted)
monoidal identity, which are potential eigenmaps.
In fact, the main result of this paper
will be used as a lemma in [EH] to prove that the full twist in the braid group has enough
eigenmaps and therefore is categorically diagonalizable. We use this to construct categori-
cal projections to arbitrary irreducible representations of the Hecke algebra, not just the sign
representation.

In this paper, our focus is on computation: the existence of Kn is known by other means,
and we use the recursive deﬁnition of Kn to compute link invariants. This strategy is out-
lined below.

1.2. Our method, decategoriﬁed. The Hecke algebra Hn is isomorphic to a quotient of the
group algebra Z[Q, Q−1][Brn] where we identify

−

= (Q − Q−1)

.

The Jones-Ocneanu trace Tr : Hn → Z[Q±, A±] is such that Tr(β) is the Homﬂy polynomial
of the braid closure ˆβ. Using the skein relation above, and the formula which deﬁnes Tr, one
can in principal compute the Homﬂy polynomial for any link. In (1.2) we introduce another
skein-like relation which is often useful.

There are elements kn ∈ Hn deﬁned inductively by k1 = 1 ∈ Hn, and

(1.1)

kn

=

kn−1

− Q2

kn−1

.

The element kn is a renormalized projection onto the sign representation: knσ±
i = −Q∓kn =
σ±
i kn for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, where σi denotes the elementary braid generator. This implies

that

(1.2)

kn−1

= (−Q)n−1

kn

+ Q2

kn−1

.

The Jones-Ocneanu trace Tr(kn) can easily be computed inductively from this equation using
the invariance of Tr under the Markov moves together with the fact that kn absorbs crossings.
We can use kn to compute link invariants:

• Assume β is given. Choose a crossing x in β. Place k1 somewhere in the vicinity of
this crossing. Since k1 is the idenity element of H1 , this does not change the element
β ∈ Hn.
• Apply the relation (1.2); one of the terms will involove the switched crossing x−1,
and in the other term k1 will have grown to k2, which now has the potential to absorb
some crossings.
• Repeat. That is, assume that β is a braid with a k(cid:96) inserted somewhere. After ma-
nipulating the diagram, if necessary, arrange the picture so that Equation (1.2) can
be applied. In one of the resulting terms, some crossings will be switched, which
in good situations will simplify β. In the other term, k(cid:96) grows in size and can now
absorb more crossings, also resulting in a simpler diagram.

If one is lucky, this process can be repeated until the trace Tr of the resulting terms is trivial
to compute. Torus links seem especially well adapted to the application of this trick.
Example 1.1. Let x = σ1 ∈ H2 denote the crossing. The trefoil is the (2, 3) torus knot, and can
be presented as the closure of x3. Equation (1.2) says that x = −Qk2 + Q2x−1. Multiplying
by x gives

Multiplying by x again gives

x2 = k2 + Q2.

x3 = (−Q−1)k2 + Q2x.

The trace of k2 is easy to compute, and the trace of x is the Homﬂy polynomial of the unknot,
up to normalization. Thus, the trace of x3 is expressed in terms of known quantities. We can
continue in this manner, obtaining

x2m = (Q2(1−m) + Q2(2−m) + ··· + Q2(m−1))k2 + Q2m

and

x2m+1 = (−Q−1)(Q2(1−m) + Q2(2−m) + ··· + Q2(m−1))k2 + Q2mx,

from which the Homﬂy polynomials of the (2, m) torus links are readily computed.

1.3. Our method, categoriﬁed. In this paper we categorify the method outlined in the pre-
vious section. As alluded to earlier in this introduction, the element kn ∈ Hn gets re-
placed by a ﬁnite complex Kn of Soergel bimodules, and the relations (1.1) and (1.2) be-
come exact triangles. More precisely, there is a chain map constructed in [Hogb] from
Q2Kn−1 → Kn−1F (yn+1), and Kn+1 is deﬁned to be the mapping cone on this map. The
fact that kn absorbs crossings becomes the fact that KnF (σi) (cid:39) T Q−1Kn (cid:39) F (σi)Kn. Here
and throughout we use T and Q to denote the functors which increase homological degree

6

and bimodule degree respectively. We have, for instance, an equivalence

(1.3)

Kn−1

(cid:39)

Kn

−→ Q2

Kn−1

(T Q−1)1−n

 ,

where the notation A (cid:39) (B → C) means that there is an exact triangle

C → A → B → T −1C.

The distinguished triangle (1.3) will be essentially the only weapon we need to attack our
computations. Suppose F (β) is a Rouquier complex that we would like to study. Iterated
application of the above exact triangle results in a certain kind of ﬁltered complex (a convolu-
tion of a twisted complex; see below) which is homotopy equivalent to F (β), and whose sub-
quotients are tensor products of Rouquier complexes and some K(cid:96). In favorable situations
these have Hochschild cohomologies which are easy to compute. There then arises the prob-
lem of recovering the homology of the total complex from the homology of its constituents.
For certain computations, we will see that this very serious complication is nulliﬁed by an
equally serious miracle: the miracle of parity.
We ﬁrst explain what sorts of ﬁltered complexes we will use. Suppose Ai (i ∈ I) is a
family of complexes, indexed by a ﬁnite partially ordered set I. Suppose dij : Aj → Ai are a
collection of linear maps such that

• dij increases homological degree by 1.
• dii is the given differential on Ai.
• dij = 0 unless i ≥ j.

• the total differential dtot :=(cid:80)

tot = 0.

i≥j dij satisﬁes d2

Then C := ((cid:76)
on this construction in homological algebra. We will also say that C = (cid:76)

i∈I Ai, dtot) is a chain complex, which we call a convolution of the Ai. More
precisely, this is the convolution of a one-sided twisted complex; see [BK90] for more details
i Ai with twisted
differential, to indicate that the differential is not merely the sum of the differentials on the
Ai. The differential on this complex may be quite complicated, possibly sending terms in
homological degree m inside Aj to terms in homological degree m + 1 inside many different
Ai, but it does respect the order on I. Thus, convolutions can also be thought of as certain
kinds of ﬁltered complexes, whose subquotients are the Ai.

Note that any exact triangle

A2 → C → A1 → T −1A2

gives rise to an equivalence C (cid:39) (A1 ⊕ A2) with twisted differential. Iterated mapping cones
can be regarded as convolutions in a similar way.
Our main application is to the Rouquier complex FTn associated to the full twist braids.
In §3 we iterate the equivalence (1.3), obtaining a convolution description of F (yn), the
Rouquier complex associated to the Young-Jucys-Murphy braid. Using the relation FTn =
FTn−1 F (yn), we then prove:

Theorem 1.2. We have FTn (cid:39) (cid:76)

v qkDv with twisted differential. The sum is over sequences
v ∈ {0, 1}n such that vn = 1. Here, q = Q2 indicates a grading shift, k is the number of zeroes in v,
and Dv is described below. The differential respects the anti-lexicographic order on sequences.

In the antilexicographic order we regard (∗, 1) as larger than (∗, 0), where ∗ denotes any
sequence of zeroes and ones. For each sequence v ∈ {0, 1}n—which we will call a shufﬂe—
there is a complex which we call Dv. For example, here is D10101101, which occurs (up to

ON THE COMPUTATION OF TORUS LINK HOMOLOGY

shift) in the expression of FT8.

D10101101 = FT3

K5

Inside v, the zeroes indicate which strands are connected to the full twist FTk, and the ones
indicate which are connected to K(cid:96), for k + (cid:96) = n.

Then, of course, one wants to compute the Hochschild homology of the complexes Dv.
Let us be precise. Given a complex F of Soergel bimodules, let HHi(C) denote the complex
obtained by applying the functor HHi to each bimodule, and let HH(C) = ⊕ HHi(C). Let
HHH(C) denote the cohomology of the complex HH(C).
Because Hochschild cohomology of a complex C is unchanged by conjugation C (cid:55)→ F CF −1
for any invertible complex F , we can move part of Dv from the bottom to the top, yielding
the complex C(cid:48)
v:

C(cid:48)
10101101 =

FT4

K3

00···0.

Note that FTn = C(cid:48)
For purely combinatorial reasons, we work instead with a similar complex Cv, which is de-
ﬁned by the same expression as C(cid:48)
v, but with K(cid:96) replaced by its reduced version ˆK(cid:96). Reduced
complexes are discussed in §4.3. The effect this has on Poincare polynomials is multiplication
by a factor of (1 − Q2).
Let v · w denote the concatenation of two shufﬂes (sequences of zeroes and ones). For any

shufﬂe v, we can use our distinguished triangle for Kn to prove the following:

Proposition 1.3. We have HH(Cv·0) (cid:39)(cid:16)

HH(C1·v) → Q2 HH(C0·v)

.

(cid:17)

Next, we can use some relatively easy arguments involving the complex Kn to prove that
HH(Cv·1) is just a direct sum of shifted copies of HH(Cv). For readers familiar with knot
theory, this last statement should be thought of as analogous to the Markov move; it allows
us to reduce the number of strands by 1. Finally, a simple observation (pertaining to reduced
complexes) allows one to replace the computation of HH(C000···0) with HH(C100···0). Com-
bining these three operations, we obtain a recursive convolution description of any HH(Cv).
This is the main result of §4.5.

Let us return to the computation of the Hochschild cohomology of the Rouquier complex

for the full twist FTn on n strands.

We are interested in the cohomology HHH(Cv) of the complexes HH(Cv). However, in
general, the cohomology of a convolution of complexes is not the direct sum of the cohomol-
ogy of the individual complexes; instead, there is a spectral sequence relating the two. Our
ﬁnal argument comes from observing a parity miracle! We prove inductively that HHH(Cv)
is concentrated in even homological degrees. This forces every spectral sequence in sight to

8

BEN ELIAS AND MATTHEW HOGANCAMP

degenerate at the E1 page, and implies that our convolution description of HH(Cv) gives a
direct sum description of HHH(Cv). See Theorem 4.22 and its proof for further discussion of
this parity argument.

Thus, we have a recursive formula for the triply graded cohomologies HHH(Cv), and as a

special case, a formula for HHH(FTn). We discuss this formula in the next section.

Let us pause to point out one of the subtleties we have ignored above. One can conjugate
a complex by a braid and obtain a non-isomorphic complex with the same Hochschild coho-
mology. We begin to apply this operation freely in §4. Above, we have stated that HH(Cv·0) is
a convolution of HH(C0·v) and HH(C1·v), but the same statement does not hold for the origi-
nal complexes. Instead, some conjugate of Cv·0 is a convolution of a conjugate of C0·v and a
conjugate of C1·v (conjugating by different braids for each term). For purposes of Hochschild
cohomology, this imprecision is harmless. However, were one to try to actually construct a
chain map from R to Cv using this computation of HHH0(Cv), then one would need to keep
track of conjugation more carefully, which would be rather difﬁcult.
On the other hand, the work done in §3 describes full twist as a genuine convolution of
complexes Dv, not complexes up to conjugation. This result is not actually needed or used in
the recursive computation of HHH(Cv) which is our main result. We include this auxiliary re-
sult because it can be used to construct chain maps from R to FTn. Our main theorem implies
that the complexes Dv satisfy a parity condition, and therefore our convolution description
of FTn induces a direct sum decompositions on Hochschild cohomology. In particular, any
chain map (up to homotopy) from R to the complex Dv (an element of HHH0(Dv)) can be
extended uniquely (up to homotopy) to a chain map from R to the entire complex FTn. We
use this fact to construct eigenmaps to the full twist in [EH].
In addition, the convolution description involving Dv from §3 can be adapted to other
torus links, whereas the results §4 are fundamentally tied to the case of (n, n)-torus links.
Remark 1.4. Suppose that one were interested in computing the Hochschild cohomologies
of FT−1
n similar to the description of
FTn above, but the parity miracle no longer holds! The corresponding spectral sequence is
far from degenerate, and consequently there are extremely few (non-nulhomotopic) chain
maps from R to FT−1
n is an interesting and
complicating feature in categorical representation theory.
1.4. The recursive formula. We will ﬁnd it convenient to use a non-standard choice of vari-
ables for our Poincare series. We let t = T 2Q−2, q = Q2, and a = Q−2A, where T denotes the
usual homological degree, Q the bimodule degree (also called internal degree, or quantum
degree), and A the Hochschild degree. For instance, the Poincar´e series of the polynomial
ring R = Q[x1, . . . , xn] is written 1/(1 − q)n, and the Poincar´e series of its Hochschild coho-
mology is (1 − q)−n(1 + a)n. In general, all our Poincar´e series will be power series in the
variables q, a, and t
Proposition 1.5. There is a unique family of polynomials fv(q, a, t), indexed by integers n ≥ 0 and
binary sequences v ∈ {0, 1}n, satisfying f∅ = 1 together with
fv·1(q, a, t) = (t|v| + a)fv

fv·0(q, a, t) = qf0·v + f1·v

The following theorem, together with the fact that the fv are rational functions in q, a, t

rather than q, a, t

2 implies that the parity miracle holds:

Theorem 1.6. The Poincar´e series of HHH(Cv) is fv(q, a, t), where Cv are the complexes from Deﬁni-
tion 4.8. In particular, the Hochschild cohomology HHH(FT) is given by fv(q, a, t) for v = (00··· 0).
These homologies are all supported in even homological degrees.

These results are restated and proved in §4.6. The proof of Theorem 1.6 comes from the

convolution description of HH(Cv) discussed in the previous section.

Pv,w(a, t), which is a product of n− k factors each of the form (t(cid:96)+m + a) for various numbers
(cid:96) and m depending on the sequences v and w.

The equivalence between these recursions is proven in chapter 5, which contains various
such numerological considerations. For example, one can show that both rule (1.6a) and
(1.6b) are actually just consequences of rule (1.6c) when applied verbatim, although this is
not obvious.
Remark 1.8. In our original version of this manuscript, our convolution argument categoriﬁed
the recursive formula of Deﬁnition 1.7 rather than Proposition 1.5, thus proving that this
complicated recursion does compute HHH(Cv). Then we discovered the simpler recursion
of Proposition 1.5, drastically simplifying our arguments.

Note that the contribution to higher Hochschild gradings comes only from a factor in
rule (1.6b) and the factor Pv,w(a, t) in rule (1.6c); both of these become explicit monomials
in t upon setting a = 0. Thus, to understand the zero-th Hochschild degree coefﬁcient, i.e.
the polynomial fv(q, 0, t), one use a simpliﬁed recursion relation. Using this, we prove the
following closed formula for the power series f00···0(q, 0, t), also known as the Poincar´e series
of the zero-th Hochschild cohomology HHH0(FT):

Example 1.10. In case n = 1 we have F1(q, t) = 1 + q + q2 + ··· = 1/(1 − q).

After rearranging, this becomes F2(q, t) = t/(1 − q) + q/(1 − q)2, agreeing with f00(q, 0, t)
which was computed above.

The proof of this closed formula from Theorem 1.6 is a simple combinatorial argument,
and is found in §5. Unfortunately, the polynomials Pv,w(q, a, t) are sufﬁciently complicated
so that we have been unable to produce a closed formula for the higher Hochschild degrees
along these lines.

We conclude with a recursion for the normalized polynomials (cid:101)fv(q, a, t) := (1−q)kfv(q, a, t),

where k is the number of zeroes in v. The recursion of Proposition 1.5 immediately gives rise
to
(1.7a)

(cid:101)fv·1(q, a, t) = (t|v| + a)(cid:101)fv
(cid:101)fv·0(q, a, t) = q(cid:101)f0·v + (1 − q)(cid:101)f1·v

(1.7b)
Remark 1.12. A clumsy card dealer has a deck of n cards, some face up and some face down.
When the dealer encounters a face down card, he deals it. When the dealer encounters a
face up card, he puts it back on the bottom of the deck, sometimes remembering to ﬂip it
face down. Eventually, the deck is dealt (with probability 1). Every time the dealer deals a
card, you, the player, choose whether to receive 1 silver coin, or a number of dollars equal

to the number of face-up cards in the deck. Then the coefﬁcient of akt(cid:96) in (cid:101)fv(q, a, t) is the

number of ways of ending up with k silver coins and (cid:96) dollars, weighted by their probability
of occuring. In particular, the coeffcient on an is 1.

Computer experiments suggest the following:

Conjecture 1.13. We have the following symmetry: (cid:101)f00···0(q, a, t) = (cid:101)f00···0(t, a, q).

This symmetry would follow from a formula of Gorsky-Negut-Rasmussen, which we dis-

cuss now.

1.5. Flag Hilbert schemes and a magic formula. According to the remarkable work of Gorsky,
Negut, and Rasmussen [GN15; GNR], triply graded link homology can be extracted from ﬂag
Hilbert schemes.2 Roughly, the picture looks like this: there is a space FHilbn(C2), which
parametrizes ﬂags of ideals I1 ⊂ ··· ⊂ In ∈ C[x, y] such that Ii/Ii−1 is 1-dimensional. As-
sociated to each n-strand braid, Gorsky-Negut-Rasmussen conjecture that there exists a line
bundle (or sheaf, or complex of sheaves) on FHilbn(C2) whose space of global sections re-
covers HHH0(F (β)). The sheaves are meant to be equivariant with respect to an obvious
action of C∗ × C∗, and the variables q, t correspond to weights with respect to this action.
The variable a can also be accounted for with more work. A combination of Atiyah-Bott
localization and careful analysis of the ﬂag Hilbert scheme near its torus ﬁxed points yields
a remarkably simple combinatorial formula which, given their conjecture, will describe the
knot homology of positive torus links. Now we state the formulas, and we will make no
further mention of the geometric foundations which motivate them.

Let λ be a Young diagram, drawn in the “English style” as in:

Suppose a box c is in the i-th column and j-th row. Here columns and rows are counted
left-to-right and top-to-bottom, starting at zero. To such a box we associated the monomial
zc = tiqj.3 To a Young diagram, we let zλ = zλ(q, t) be the product of zc as c ranges over all
the boxes of λ. Note that zλ(q, t) = zλt(t, q), where λt is the transposed partition.
A box in λ is removable if λ (cid:114) c is a Young diagram. Now we discuss boxes, i.e. coordinates
(i, j), which need not be in the given Young diagram λ. We call c /∈ λ an outer corner of λ if
the top left corner of c coincides with the bottom right corner of a removable box in λ. We
call a box c /∈ λ an inner corner of λ if λ ∪ c is a Young diagram. Pictorially, we have

The inner corners are darkly shaded, and the outer corners are lightly shaded. Let In(λ) and
Out(λ) denote the sets of inner and outer corners of λ. If c ∈ In(λ), then we deﬁne

(cid:81)
(cid:81)
d∈Out(λ)(zc − zd)
e∈In(λ)(cid:114){c}(zc − ze)

.

fλ,c(q, t) :=

It is easy to observe that fλ,c(q, t) = fλt,ct(t, q), where ct is the corresponding transposed
inner corner of λt.
Remark 1.14. Let {x1, . . . , xn} and {y1, . . . , yn+1} be two families of abstract variables. It is
not a hard excercise to show that

2We warn the reader that this story is related to, but quite different from, other connections between link
3 In other variables, zc = T 2iQ−2x(c), where x(c) is the content of the box c, which is i − j.

Applying this general formula to the deﬁnition above, one obtains

(cid:88)

c∈In(λ)

fλ,c = 1,

a fact which has nothing to do with the combinatorics of partitions.

A standard tableau T can be thought of as a sequence of Young diagrams T = (λ1, . . . , λn)
such that λ1 = (cid:3) and λi+1 (cid:114) λi = (cid:3). Let Sh(T ) = λn denote the shape of T . To each tableau
we set

n−1(cid:89)

fT (q, t) :=

fλi,ci(q, t)

i=1

Finally, associated to a Young diagram λ, let gλ(q, a, t) denote the product over all boxes

where ci ∈ In(λi) is the box such that λi+1 = λi ∪ ci. Once more, fT (q, t) = fT t(t, q), where
T t is the transposed tableau.

a sum over all tableaux with n boxes. In particular, the right hand side is symmetric under replacing
q with t, and thus so is the left hand side. We remind the reader that zSh(T ) and fT are functions of q
and t, while gSh(T ) is a function of q, a, and t.

When r = 0, the formula yields 1 = (cid:80)

T gSh(λ)(q, a, t)fT (q, t), whose a-degree zero part
follows from (1.8). We have veriﬁed the magic formula for r = 1 and for 1 ≤ n ≤ 4, using a

The factor z−1
Sh(T ) comes from taking the a-degree n part of gSh(T )(q, a, t). This instance of the
magic formula can be prove directly from our recursive description of this series (see Remark
1.12).

Another consequence of the magic formula concerns the sub-maximal part of the Poincar´e

series of full twists:
Conjecture 1.16. The a-degree n − 1 part of the Poincar´e series of HHH(FTn) is a geometric pro-
gression

We expect that this is not difﬁcult to prove, but we do not do so here. We have veriﬁed

this conjecture up to n = 7 using computer calculations.
In the algorithm to compute f00···0(q, a, t) using (1.6c), one travels from the zero sequence
(00··· 0) ∈ {0, 1}n to the sequence ∅ ∈ {0, 1}0 by repeatedly choosing subsets (i.e. smaller
sequences in {0, 1}k) of the previous set of zeroes. Our instinct indicates that such a sequence
of sequences can be thought of as encoding the entries in a Robinson-Shensted row-bumping

from this sequence of sequences and the contribution to(cid:80)

algorithm, and can thus be assigned a tableau. The contribution to f00···0(q, a, t) coming
T zSh(T )gSh(T )fT coming from the

tableau T have many superﬁcial similarities, but no direct relation has yet been found.
1.6. Organization of the paper. In §2 we provide some background. We describe various
elements of the braid group, including full twists, Young-Jucys-Murphy elements, shufﬂe
braids, and shufﬂe twists. In §2.4 we brieﬂy recall Soergel’s categoriﬁcation of the Hecke
algebra and Rouquier’s categoriﬁcation of the braid group. In §2.5 we deﬁne convolutions of
complexes, and give the crucial argument involving the degeneration of a spectral sequence
thanks to parity considerations. In §2.6 we recall the main result of [Hogb], a complex which
categoriﬁes a renormalized Jones-Wenzl projector, and state its properties. The speciﬁcs of
the Soergel-Rouquier construction need not concern the reader, as all we will use in this
paper are facts about the braid group and the results of [Hogb].
In §3 we ﬁnd a convolution description of the full twist FTn in terms of certain complexes
Dv associated to v ∈ {0, 1}n.
In §4 we switch to a Hochschild frame of mind. Since Hochschild cohomology of a com-
plex is invariant under conjugation by Rouquier complexes of braids, we will allow ourselves
to freely conjugate complexes. In §4.2 we discuss another result of [Hogb] which is an analog
of the Markov move on braid closures: a relationship between the Hochschild homologies
of the Jones-Wenzl projector on n strands and the projector on n− 1 strands. We also discuss
reduced complexes in §4.3, ﬁnally describing complexes Cv in §4.4 which may be thought of
as reduced versions of conjugates of Dv. Finally, in §4.5 and §4.6 we state and prove the main
result, which is a convolution description of the Hochschild cohomology of Cv in terms of
the Hochschild cohomologies of smaller Cw, which is an analogue of the recursion of Propo-
sition 1.5.
In §5 we prove some combinatorial results which justify Theorem 1.9, our closed form

solution for HHH0(FT), and show that the two recursive formulas agree.

In the appendix, we include without proof some computations for other (n, m) torus links.
These were obtained by techniques entirely analogous to the computation for (n, n) torus
links, and many of them have not appeared in the literature before.

1.7. Notation. We collect here some of our notational conventions, for the reader’s conve-
nience. Unfamiliar concepts will be explained in due course. Soergel bimodules are graded.
We denote by (1) the grading shift, so that M (1)i = M i+1. We let Q = (−1) denote the
functor which increases the degree of each element. Complexes of Soergel bimodules are bi-
graded. The differentials always preserve the bimodule degree, and increase homological
degree by 1. The shift in homological degree is denoted by (cid:104)1(cid:105), so that C(a)(cid:104)b(cid:105)i,j = Ci+a,j+b.
We denote by Kb(A) the homotopy category of ﬁnite complexes over an additive category A.
Isomorphism in Kb(A), that is, chain homotopy equivalence, is denoted by (cid:39). The existence
of a distinguished triangle

A → B → C δ→ A(cid:104)1(cid:105)

14

BEN ELIAS AND MATTHEW HOGANCAMP

will be indicated by writing B (cid:39) (C δ→ A). We also let T = (cid:104)−1(cid:105) denote the functor which
increases homological degree by 1. If β is a braid, we denote the braid exponent by e(β);
this is the signed number of crossings in a diagram representing β. The Rouquier complex
F (β) is normalized so that if β is a positive braid, then there is a chain map (T Q−1)e(β)R →
F (β) which is the inclusion of the degree e(β) chain bimodule, whereas if β is a negative
braid, there is a chain map F (β) → (T Q−1)e(β)R which is the projection onto the degree e(β)
bimodule. Note, in [AH] and [Hogb], the shifts (k) and (cid:104)(cid:96)(cid:105) would have been denoted (−k)
and (cid:104)−(cid:96)(cid:105), respectively.

Hochschild cohomology gives rise to a functor HH whose input is a graded bimodule, and
whose output is a bigraded vector space. The additional grading is called the Hochschild
grading, and shifts in the Hochschild grading are denoted by A. Extending to complexes
gives a functor from complexes of graded bimodules to complexes of bigraded vector spaces.
These are triply graded objects, so all together we have the shift functors Q, A, T . If C is a
complex of bimodules, then the homology of HH(C) is denoted by HHH(C).
We also ﬁnd it convenient to introduce t = T 2Q−2, q = Q2, and a = AQ−2. One might call
these the geometric variables, since they appear most naturally in the connection with Hilbert
schemes. When convenient, we express our degree shifts and Poincar´e series in terms of
these variables.

2. BACKGROUND AND KEY TOOLS

2.1. Braids. Let Brn denote the braid group with n strands. The generators will be denoted
by σi, for 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, and drawn as an overcrossing of the i-th and (i + 1)-st strands. The
overcrossing σi and its inverse, the undercrossing σ−1

σi =

i − 1

n − i − 1

i

, are depicted below.
σ−1

i − 1

=

i

n − i − 1

A labelled strand denotes the corresponding number of parallel copies of that strand. We
will always draw our braids in a rectangle, with n boundary points on the top and bottom.
Composition of braids is given by vertical stacking, so that ββ(cid:48) is β on top of β(cid:48). There is a
group homomorphism e : Brn → Z sending σ±
(cid:55)→ ±1. The integer e(β) is called the braid
exponent of β.

A braid is positive if it has an expression only involving overcrossings, and negative if it has
an expression only involving undercrossings. Given an element w of the symmetric group
Sn, its positive braid lift in Brn is the product σi1σi2 ··· σid, where si1si2 ··· sid is a reduced
expression for w in terms of the usual Coxeter generators {si} of Sn. This element is inde-
pendent of the choice of reduced expression. Its negative braid lift is σ−1
Deﬁnition 2.1. We deﬁne the following symmetries of Brn:

··· σ−1
id .

τ (α)τ (β). Then τ is an involution.

(1) Rotation about the vertical axis: Let τ : Brn → Brn satisfy τ (σi) = σn−i and τ (αβ) =
(2) Rotation about the horizontal axis: Let ω : Brn → Brn satisfy ω(σi) = σi and ω(αβ) =
(3) Reﬂection across a horizontal plane: Let (−)∨ : Brn → Brn satisfy σ∨

ω(β)ω(α). Then ω is an antiinvolution.
and
(αβ)∨ = β∨α∨. Then (−)∨ is an antiinvolution, and is just another notation for taking
the inverse braid.
(−)L is an involution, and (β)L = ω(β)∨.

(4) Crossing swap: Let (−)L : Brn → Brn satisfy σL

and (αβ)L = (α)L(β)L. Then

i = σ−1

The letter L indicates that βL this is the left-handed version of the braid β. This swaps the
positive and negative braid lifts of an element of Sn. Note that τ and ω preserve positive
braids, while (−)∨ and (−)L swap positive braids and negative braids. These symmetries all
commute with each other.
We let (cid:116) : Brk × Brl → Brk+l denote the homomorphism given by horizontal concatena-

tion.
2.2. Shufﬂe braids.
Deﬁnition 2.2. A shufﬂe permutation is a permutation π ∈ Sn which is a minimal length coset
representative for some coset in Sn/(Sk × S(cid:96)), for some 0 ≤ k, (cid:96) ≤ n with k + (cid:96) = n. Said
differently, a shufﬂe permutation preserves the ordering of {1, . . . , k} and {k + 1,··· , n} for
some k, but “shufﬂes” these two sets together.
Let v ∈ {0, 1}n be a sequence with k zeroes and (cid:96) ones. We call v a shufﬂe. There is
a corresponding shufﬂe permutation πv, a minimal coset representation for Sn/(Sk × S(cid:96)),
for which πv({1, . . . , k}) gives the locations of the zeroes, and πv({k + 1, . . . , n}) gives the
locations of the ones.

Note that a shufﬂe permutation can come from a shufﬂe in multiple different ways. For
example, the identity element is a minimal coset representative for Sk × S(cid:96) for every k and
l with k + (cid:96) = n; whenever all the zeroes come before all the ones, π0···01···1 is the identity.
When the shufﬂe v ∈ {0, 1}n is understood, k will always refer to the number of zeroes, and
(cid:96) to the number of ones.
Example 2.3. The shufﬂe permutation π1···10 is the n-cycle (n, n − 1, . . . , 2, 1).
Deﬁnition 2.4. For each v ∈ {0, 1}n, let βv denote the positive braid lift of πv. Let Twv :=
ω(βv)βv, the shufﬂe twist, denote the positive pure braid obtained by gluing βv with its rota-
tion.
Example 2.5. If v = (0101100), then the shufﬂe permutation πv, its positive braid lift, and the
associated pure braid are pictured as:

πv =

βv =

Twv =

.

Note that v partitions the strands in these diagrams into two subsets: the 0-strands and the
1-strands. In βv the 0-strands cross over the 1-strands. In the ω(βv) portion of Twv, they cross
back under.

The following gives a useful recursive description of the braids Twv:

Proposition 2.6. Let v be a shufﬂe with k zeroes and (cid:96) ones, with k + (cid:96) = n. Let · denote con-
catenation of shufﬂes, so that v · 0 and v · 1 are the two shufﬂes of length n + 1 which extend v.
Then

Twv·0 =

Twv

k 1

(cid:96)

Here a strand labeled (cid:96) actually represents (cid:96) strands cabled together in the usual way, so that the
“thick crossings” in the expression for Twv·0 each represent (cid:96) ordinary crossings. This recursion,

Tww·1 =

k

Twv
(cid:96) 1 .

16

BEN ELIAS AND MATTHEW HOGANCAMP

together with the base cases Tw0 = Tw1 = 1, produces all the shufﬂe twists Twv. There is a similar
such recursion which describes Tw0·v and Tw1·v.
Proof. Graphically obvious.

(cid:3)

We now discuss the behavior of the shufﬂe braids with respect to the symmetries of the

braid group.
Deﬁnition 2.7. For each v ∈ {0, 1}n, let r(v) denote the sequence obtained by reversing the
order, so that r(v)i = vn+1−i. Let v∗ be the sequence obtained by swapping the 1’s with 0’s
and vice versa: (v∗)i = 1 − vi.
Proposition 2.8. Let v ∈ {0, 1}n be given. Then

(1) τ (βv) = βr(v)∗
(2) ω(β−1
v ) = βL
v
Proof. Clear.
2.3. Half twists and shufﬂe braids. Let HT = HTn ∈ Brn denote the half twist braid

HTn = σ1(σ2σ1)(σ3σ2σ1)··· (σn−1 ··· σ2σ1).

(cid:3)

The full twist is FTn = HT2
n, and is central in the braid group. This implies that the mapping
β (cid:55)→ HT β HT−1 deﬁnes an involution on the braid group. Indeed, HT β HT−1 = τ (β). We
leave the proof of this fact to this reader, as it is elementary. It is also elementary that HTn is
ﬁxed by τ and ω.

We will need to know how the shufﬂe braids interact with HT and FT:

Proposition 2.9. Let v ∈ {0, 1}n be given. Let k and (cid:96) be the number of zeroes and ones in v,
respectively. Then

(1) HTn γv = γr(v)∗ HTn, where γv is any of the braids βv, ω(βv), βL
(2) HTn βL
(3) FTn TwL

v = βr(v)(HTk (cid:116) HT(cid:96)).
v ∼ Twr(v)(FTk (cid:116) FT(cid:96)).

v , or ω(βv)L.

Here ∼ denotes that the given braids are equivalent modulo conjugation.
Proof. Statement (1) follows from Proposition 2.8, since conjugation by HTn acts on the braid
group by τ (180 degree rotation about a vertical axis).

The idea of the proof of (2) is best illustrated with an example. For instance, when v =

(1100101) we have

HTk+(cid:96)

(cid:39)

(cid:39)

HTk+(cid:96)

(cid:39)

.

HTk

HT(cid:96)

HTk

HT(cid:96)

In the second diagram, the left-handed shufﬂe braid corresponds to r(v)∗ = (0101100) by
statement (1) of the proposition. In the third diagram we have simply rewritten the half
twist in terms of the “thick crossing” between 4 cabled strands and 3 cabled strands. This is
a well-known identity in the braid group. In the last diagram we have performed an isotopy.
Finally, statement (3) follows from (2). First, note that an application of ω to statement (2)

yields

ω(βL

v ) HT = (HTk (cid:116) HT(cid:96))ω(βr(v))

Then observe:

∼ ω(βr(v))βr(v)(FTk (cid:116) FT(cid:96))

The ﬁrst equality holds since FTn ∈ Brn is central. The second holds since FT = HT HT.
The third holds by (1) and (2). Finally the last ∼ holds by transferring the (HTk (cid:116) HT(cid:96)) to the
right-hand side (recall that β ∼ β(cid:48) means β is conjugate to β(cid:48)). This completes the proof. (cid:3)
2.4. Rouquier complexes. Let R = Rn = Q[x1, . . . , xn] be the polynomial ring in n vari-
ables, graded so that deg xi = 2. This is the polynomial ring associated to the standard
n-dimensional representation of Sn over Q. Given a graded R-bimodule M, we let M (1)
denote the shifted bimodule for which M (1)d = M 1+d, where M d denotes the degree d
part of M. We denote tensor product of graded bimodules over R simply by juxtaposition:
M ⊗R N = M N. We often let 1 = 1n denote the bimodule R, which is the monoidal identity.

For each i with 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, let Bi denote the graded R-bimodule

Bi := R ⊗Ri R(1),

where Ri denotes the subring of polynomials invariant under the reﬂection si = (i, i + 1).
Let SBimn denote the category of Soergel bimodules associated to R. This is the full graded
monoidal additive Karoubian subcategory of graded R-bimodules generated by Bi for 1 ≤
i ≤ n − 1. Thus, its objects are direct sums of grading shifts of direct summands of tensor
products of Bi. Let Cb(SBim) denote the category of bounded complexes of Soergel bimod-
ules modulo homotopy.
Associated to each braid word β we have the Rouquier complex F (β) in Cb(SBim), deﬁned

by

together with F (ββ(cid:48)) = F (β)F (β(cid:48)). The underline indicates which object lies in homological
degree 0. Rouquier proved that there is a canonical homotopy equivalence between F (β)
and F (β(cid:48)) when β and β(cid:48) are braid words expressing the same braid. A more direct proof
which works over Z can also be found in [EK10].
Remark 2.10. Recall the notation Q, T for gradings shifts (see §1.7). One reason why t is more
natural that T is that any Rouquier complex F (β) always has a unique copy of R which
appears in homological degree e(β) and internal degree −e(β), so that this copy of R appears
2 e(β), where e(β) is the braid exponent. It was proven in [EW14] that Rouquier
with shift t
complexes for reduced expressions are perverse (when one works in characteristic zero). A
complex is perverse if each indecomposable bimodule in the complex appears with a grading
shift equal to its homological degree, or equivalently, that the grading and homological shifts
are described only as powers of (T Q−1). Note that the Rouquier complex for the full twist
is not perverse, nor are shufﬂe twists. We will not use any perversity results in this paper.
Nonetheless, we will express our shifts using the variables t = T 2Q−2 and q = Q2.

The symmetries of the braid group lift to symmetries of SBimn and its homotopy category.

Let τ : R → R denote the map sending xi (cid:55)→ xn+1−i.

BEN ELIAS AND MATTHEW HOGANCAMP
Deﬁnition 2.11. We deﬁne the following symmetries of SBimn:

(1) Rotation about vertical axis: let τ : SBimn → SBimn denote the covariant graded
monoidal functor induced by the Dynkin automorphism of Sn. That is, τ : Bi (cid:55)→
Bn−i, and satisﬁes τ (M N ) = τ (M )τ (N ) and τ (M (1)) = τ (M )(1).
(2) Rotation about horizontal axis: let ω : SBimn → SBimn denote the covariant graded
anti-monoidal functor which sends Bi (cid:55)→ Bi and satisﬁes ω(M N ) = ω(N )ω(M ) and
ω(M (1)) = ω(M )(1).
n denote the con-
travariant anti-graded anti-monoidal “duality” functor on SBimn, which sends Bi (cid:55)→
Bi and satisﬁes (M N )∨ = N∨M∨ and M (1)∨ = M∨(−1).
(4) Crossing swap: Let (−)L : SBimn → SBimn denote the contravariant anti-graded
monoidal functor (−)∨ ◦ ω.

(3) Reﬂection across a horizontal plane: let (−)∨ : SBimn → SBimop

These symmetries commute up to canonical isomorphism.

Proposition 2.12. These symmetries intertwine the braid symmetries from Deﬁnition 2.1, under
Rouquier’s map F , via a canonical isomorphism. In particular, F (β)∨ ∼= F (β−1).
Proof. This is easy. Although we have not stated explicitly what the differentials in F (σi)
and F (σ−1
) are, they live in one-dimensional morphism spaces, and are interchanged by
(cid:3)
duality.
There is an isomorphism of rings Rk (cid:2) Rl → Rk+l given by renaming the variables, where
(cid:2) denotes tensor product over Q. Correspondingly, there is an inclusion functor (cid:116) : SBimk (cid:2)
SBiml → SBimk+l, which sends Bi (cid:2) 1l to Bi and sends 1k (cid:2) Bi to Bk+i. This intertwines
with the map (cid:116) : Brk × Brl → Brk+l after applying Rouquier’s map F .
It was proven by Soergel that morphisms between objects in SBimn are free as left or right
modules over Rn. Using Soergel’s Hom formula [Soe07, Thm 5.15], one can prove that (cid:116) is
actually fully faithful, after identifying Rk (cid:2) Rl with Rn. Another way of phrasing this result
is that the inclusion SBimi → SBimn for i < n, which comes from the functor (−) (cid:116) 1n−i, is
fully faithful after base change along the inclusion from Ri to Rn. See [EW, Remark 3.19] for
further discussion.
2.5. Complexes and convolutions. We may write (cid:104)1(cid:105) for the homological shift of a complex,
so that the homological degree d part of F(cid:104)1(cid:105) is the homological degree d + 1 part of F . By
convention, (cid:104)1(cid:105) also negates the differential.
We now introduce some notation which we will be used exhaustively throughout. To
motivate it, we begin with an example. Suppose A and B are complexes, and f : A → B is a
chain map. The mapping cone Cf is the chain complex (Cf )k = Ak+1 ⊕ Bk with differential
. In other words Cf = A(cid:104)1(cid:105) ⊕ B with an additional component
given by the matrix
of the differential from A(cid:104)1(cid:105) to B, given by f. Note that the additional sign on the differential
of A(cid:104)1(cid:105) is necessary for the differential on Cf to satisfy d2 = 0. We prefer to keep track of the
homological degree shift explicitly, so that the mapping cone can be written as

(cid:104) −dA 0

(cid:105)

f

dB

Cf = (A(cid:104)1(cid:105)

f−→ B).

We will also say that Cf = A(cid:104)1(cid:105) ⊕ B with twisted differential. This notation will come in
handy when we later consider mapping cones of mapping cones, and so on.

For instance, this notation allows us to use explicit shifts instead of underlines in a com-

plex, so that we may write

F (σi) = (Bi → R(1)(cid:104)−1(cid:105))

F (σ−1

i

) = (R(−1)(cid:104)1(cid:105) → Bi).

ON THE COMPUTATION OF TORUS LINK HOMOLOGY

The general way to describe an iterated cone is using the idea of a convolution of com-
plexes. Let Fj (j ∈ J) be complexes of R-bimodules indexed by a ﬁnite partially-ordered
set J. Let dj denote the differential on the complex Fj (which, in our notation, is a map of
bigraded R-bimodules of homological degree +1 and graded degree 0). Let E = ⊕j∈J Fj be
a bigraded R-bimodule, and let d be a differential on E such that

• restricted to a map Fj → Fj, d agrees with dj, and
• restricted to a map Fj → Fj(cid:48), d is zero unless j ≤ j(cid:48).

equivalent to E. We may write d =(cid:80)

mapping Fi to Fj.

Then E is called a convolution of the complexes Fj, as is any complex which is homotopy
i≤j dji, where dji is the component of the differential
We refer to Fj as the subquotients of the convolution E. We say that E = ⊕j∈J Fj with
twisted differential, indicating that the differential is not just the direct sum of the differentials
on each summands. We say that this twisted differential respects the partial order on J
because dji = 0 for i (cid:2) j.

f−→ B)
Remark 2.13. By abuse of language, we will refer to a two term convolution E = (A
as a mapping cone. Note that, strictly speaking f is not a chain map from A to B, but rather
a chain map A(cid:104)−1(cid:105) → B. Here J has two elements, with the order determined by the arrow.
A general convolution can be described as an iterated cone of complexes, where each Fj is
added one at a time.

In practice, one can often show indirectly that a complex E is a convolution of other com-
plexes Fj, in which case the components dji of the differential may be difﬁcult to write down
for i (cid:54)= j (the task is complicated further by the presence of homotopy equivalences). In par-
ticular, this makes it difﬁcult to compute the homology H(E). Thankfully, a parity argument
will come to the rescue in this paper.

j∈J Fj with twisted differential, for some ﬁnite partially ordered
set J. Suppose the homology H(Fj) is supported in even homological degrees, for all j ∈ J. Then

Proposition 2.14. Suppose E =(cid:76)
H(E) ∼=(cid:76)
be maximal. Set B := Fj and A =(cid:76)
for some map δ of homological degree +1. We have H(A) ∼= (cid:76)
we must prove that H(E) ∼= H(A) ⊕ H(B).

Proof. We induct on the cardinality of J. In the base case J = {j}, we have E = Fj, and the
statement is trivial. Now, assume by induction that we have proved the result for partially
ordered sets of cardinality r, and let J be a partially ordered set of cardinality r + 1. Let j ∈ J
i∈J(cid:114){j} Fj with twisted differential. Note that E = A⊕B
E = (A δ−→ B)

The short exact sequence 0 → B → E → A → 0 gives rise to a long exact sequence

i(cid:54)=j H(Fi) by induction, so

j H(Fj).

with twisted differential:

··· → H k−1(A) → H k(B) → H k(E) → H k(A) → H k+1(B) → ··· .

Our parity assumption implies that H k(A) = H k(B) = 0 when k is odd. Thus H k(E) = 0
when k is odd. When k is even we have a short exact sequence
0 → H k(B) → H k(E) → H k(A) → 0.

If we work over a ﬁeld, then this short exact sequence splits. This completes the inductive
(cid:3)
step, and completes the proof.

BEN ELIAS AND MATTHEW HOGANCAMP

Remark 2.15. In general, there is a spectral sequence converging to H(E), whose E2 page is
j H(Fj). If H(Fi) is even, then the subsequent differentials (which have odd homological

degree) must all vanish. This gives an alternate proof of the above.
Remark 2.16. The above presents a “computation-free and serendipitous” approach to com-
puting homology groups. Suppose we wish to compute the homology of a chain complex E.
We may get lucky and discover a ﬁltration on E whose successive quotients are supported
in even homological degrees. In this case, Proposition 2.14 says that H(E) simply splits as
a direct sum of these homology groups. In this paper we are extraordinarily lucky in this
regard.
2.6. Categoriﬁed symmetrizers. In this subsection we recall the constructions of the second
author in [Hogb], and extract from them a ﬁnite complex Kn ∈ Kb(SBimn) which will play
an essential role in this paper. First, deﬁne the following complexes:
Deﬁnition 2.17. Let X = Xn = F (σn−1 ··· σ1) and Y = Yn = F (σ−1
1 ) denote the
Rouquier complexes associated to the positive and negative braid lifts of the standard n-
cycle (n, n − 1, . . . , 2, 1). In other words, X = F (βv) and Y = F (βL
v ) for v = (11··· 10). Note
that τ (X) = ω(X) = Y −1, τ (Y ) = ω(Y ) = X−1.

n−1 ··· σ−1

In this paper we adopt a graphical notation for certain complexes of Soergel bimodules.
We will denote a braid and its Rouquier complex similarly, so for example pictures such as

X4 =

and

Y4 =

will denote the complexes Xn and Yn of Deﬁnition 2.17. The tensor product of complexes
corresponds to vertical stacking. For example we have

(2.1)

X4Y −1

4 =

∈ Br4

Complexes of the form XY −1 play a very special role in this paper. They are the Rouquier
complexes associated to the Young-Jucys-Murphy braids. Note that braids corresponding
to XkY −1
generate a commutative subgroup of the braid group, and their product is the
full twist. The following deﬁnes a family of complexes Kn which are compatible with these
braids, in a particular sense.
Proposition 2.18. There exists a family of ﬁnite complexes Kn ∈ Cb(SBimn) (n ≥ 1) such that:

k

(1) K1 = R.
(2) We have Kn−1XY −1 (cid:39) (Kn → qKn−1). Graphically this is

(3) Kn kills all generating Bott-Samelson bimodules in SBimn. That is, KnBi (cid:39) 0 (cid:39) BiKn for

1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1.

Note that ﬁniteness of the Kn follows from the recursion (2).

Proof. In [Hogb] the second author deﬁned deﬁned a family of complexes Pn ∈ K−(SBimn)
such that

ON THE COMPUTATION OF TORUS LINK HOMOLOGY

21

• Pn kills all Bott-Samelsons: Pn ⊗ Bi (cid:39) 0 (cid:39) Bi ⊗ Pn for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1.
• Any other complex M ∈ K−(SBimn) kills Bott-Samelsons if and only if Pn ⊗ M (cid:39)

M (cid:39) Pn ⊗ M.

Further, Pn is uniquely characterized up to homotopy equivalence by these properties. The
complexes Pn can be thought of as categorical projections onto the sign representation of the
Hecke algebra:
We will construct the complexes Kn inductively. First, set K1 = R1. Now, assume Kn−1
has been constructed for n ≥ 2. In §4 of [Hogb] it was shown that there is a chain map
ψ : qPn−1 → Pn−1XY −1 such that the mapping cone Qn := Cone(ψ) kills Bott-Samelsons4.
Graphically, this is:

From the above characterization of Pn−1, the fact that Kn−1 kills the Bott-Samelsons in
SBimn−1 implies that Kn−1Pn−1 (cid:39) Kn−1. We deﬁne Kn by tensoring Equation (2.3) on the
left with Kn−1 and applying the equivalence Kn−1Pn−1 (cid:39) Kn−1. Note that Kn (cid:39) Kn−1Qn.
The recursion (2) is satisﬁed after rotating triangles. Clearly Kn kills all Bott-Samelsons on
the right since Qn does. It was shown in [Hogb] that a complex kills Bott-Samelsons from
(cid:3)
the right if and only if it kills all Bott-Samelsons from the left. This gives statement (3).

3. RESOLVING THE FULL TWIST

In this section we give a new expression for the Rouquier complex associated to the full
twist braid FTn. Our main result is that FTn ∈ Cb(SBimn) is homotopy equivalent to a
convolution whose subquotients are described in terms of shufﬂe braids and the complexes
Kn.

3.1. Young-Jucys-Murphy braids. First, we describe the Rouquier complexes for Young-
Jucys-Murphy braids as convolutions. We write yi = σi−1 ··· σ2σ1σ1σ2 ··· σi−1 for the i-th
Young-Jucys-Murphy braid, which is an element of Bri. For example, y4 is picture in (2.1).
We may also view yi as an element of Brn for any n ≥ i, which acts on the ﬁrst i strands; this
comes from the inclusion Bri = Bri ×1n−i ⊂ Bri × Brn−i → Brn.
Deﬁnition 3.1. Let v ∈ {0, 1}n be a shufﬂe on n letters, with k zeroes and (cid:96) ones, so that
k + (cid:96) = n. Let Ev ∈ Cb(SBim) be deﬁned as follows:
(3.1)

v )(1k (cid:116) K(cid:96))F (ω(βL
Note that the shufﬂe braids involved here are left-handed.

Ev := F (βL

v )).

Example 3.2. For example, when v = (1011001), the complex Ev looks like

K4

.

In this section the only complexes that concern us are those of the form Ev·1. Recall that
· denotes concatenation of sequences, so that v · 1 ranges over all sequences which end in 1.
Note that (analogously to Proposition 2.6) βv·1 is equal to βv (cid:116) 11, and the right-most strand
in Ev·1 is a straight vertical line which does not cross over or under any other strands.

Proposition 3.3. The Rouquier complex F (yn) satisﬁes
t−((cid:96)

F (yn) (cid:39) (cid:77)

2)qkEv·1

with twisted differential. As usual, k is the number of zeroes in v and (cid:96) is the number of ones, with
k + (cid:96) = n − 1. The partial order in this convolution is the antilexicographic order on sequences.

v∈{0,1}n−1

ON THE COMPUTATION OF TORUS LINK HOMOLOGY

23

Remark 3.4. Consider the “thick crossing” between Km and n − m parallel strands, which
one might picture as

Km
n − m

.

m

There is an expression of this complex as a direct sum (with twisted differential) of complexes
Ev·1m with shifts, where v ∈ {0, 1}n−m. Proposition 3.3 corresponds to the case m = 1. This is
the only case that concerns us, so we leave the statement (and proof) for m > 1 to the reader.
Proof. We prove this by induction on n ≥ 1. In the base case we have y1 = 1 and F (y1) = K1.
There is exactly one element of {0, 1}0, the empty sequence, so that the sum on the RHS has
one term E∅·1, and that term is K1. This establishes the base case.
Assume by induction that the result holds for n ≥ 1. Note that yn+1 = σnynσn. By

induction, we have

(3.2)

F (σn)F (yn)F (σn) (cid:39) (cid:77)

v∈{0,1}n−1

GvF (σn)(Ev·1 (cid:116) 11)F (σn)

with twisted differential, for some grading shifts Gv. Each of the above summands can be
rewritten as follows: for ﬁxed v ∈ {0, 1}n−1, let k denote the number of zeroes in v and (cid:96) the
number of ones. Then the summand corresponding to v is

The ﬁrst equality (or rather, homotopy equivalence) is a simple isotopy, pulling one strand
past the cable of l strands. In the second equality we have used (2.4). Applying Lemma
2.19 to the ﬁrst complex on the right, K(cid:96)+2 absorbs the (cid:96) negative crossings (in the cabled
crossing below K(cid:96)+2) and 1 positive crossing (above), gaining an additional grading shift of
2− 1
2 (cid:96). After absorbing these crossings and applying an isotopy to the right-most complex,

The ﬁrst term is just Ev·1·1, and the second is Ev·0·1. Applying this simpliﬁcation to each
term of the right-hand side of (3.2) completes the inductive step. It remains to verify that the
grading shifts and partial order on the convolution are as claimed.

24

BEN ELIAS AND MATTHEW HOGANCAMP

The grading shifts are determined recursively by Gv·1 = t−|v|Gv and Gv·0 = qGv, from

which the formula Gv = t−(|v|

2 )qn−1−|v| follows easily.

Suppose that, for two sequences v, w ∈ {0, 1}n−1, the differential from the summand
Ev·1 to the summand Ew·1 is zero in the twisted differential for F (yn). Then replacing
F (σn)(Ev·1 (cid:116) 11)F (σn) and F (σn)(Ew·1 (cid:116) 11)F (σn) by the equivalent complexes in the right-
hand side of (3.3) does not introduce any differential between any of the corresponding terms
in the twisted differential for F (yn+1). Moreover, there is no differential from Ev·0·1 to Ev·1·1.
Therefore, induction implies that the twisted differential respects the antilexicographic or-
(cid:3)
der.

3.2. The full twist. It is fairly easy to bootstrap this convolution description of the Young-
Jucys-Murphy elements into a convolution description of the full twist.
Deﬁnition 3.5. Let v ∈ {0, 1}n be a shufﬂe, with k zeroes and (cid:96) ones, so that k + (cid:96) = n. Then
let Dv ∈ Cb(SBim) be deﬁned as follows:

(3.4)

Dv := F (βv)(FTk (cid:116)K(cid:96))F (ω(βv)).

Note that the shufﬂe braids involved here are right-handed.

Example 3.6. Here is Dv for v = (10101101).

D10101101 = FT3

K5

In this example, the last index in v is a one, so the rightmost strand in Dv does not cross the
strands coming from the full twist.

Theorem 3.7. Let FTn denote the full right-handed twist on n-strands. We have

(3.5)

FTn (cid:39) (cid:77)

qkDv·1

v∈{0,1}n−1

with twisted differential, respecting the antilexicographic order on {0, 1}n−1. Here k is the number of
zeroes in v.

We have omitted the functor F from the notation, identifying a braid with its Rouquier

complex. We employ this abuse of notation frequently henceforth.

Proof. Note that the full twist braid factors as FTn+1 = FTn yn+1, where as usual FTn is
viewed as an element inside Brn+1 via the inclusion Brn → Brn+1. Actually it will be more
useful to write

FTn+1 = HTn yn+1 HTn .

(cid:1) crossings), and the two copies of HTk contribute a

Remark 3.8. One can construct convolution descriptions of other torus links in much the same
way. At the moment, we have done this ad hoc for small torus links, and have neglected to
write it down here for reasons of space. It would be interesting to ﬁnd a combinatorial frame-
work (analogous to shufﬂes) in order to treat the general torus link in a more holistic fashion.
The results of the next chapter, including the parity miracle which makes these convolution
descriptions useful, can also be adapted to our small examples in a straightforward way. The
fruits of this labor are presented in the appendix.

4. RESOLVING THE HOCHSCHILD HOMOLOGY OF THE FULL TWIST

In this section we introduce Hochschild cohomology HH, and we compute HH(FTn) for
all n ≥ 1. Our strategy is recursive. The main result of the previous section expresses FTn
as a ﬁltered complex whose subquotients are of the form Dv. In this section we show that
HH(Dv) has a ﬁltration in terms of other HH(Dw), with smaller w. However, we will ﬁnd it
convenient to work instead with related complexes Cv, to be deﬁned in section §4.4.

4.1. Hochschild cohomology. The zeroth Hochschild cohomology functor HH0 is the func-
tor which takes a graded R-bimodule M to the graded vector space ⊕m∈ZHom(R, M (m)) of
bimodule maps of all degrees. Its higher derived functors HHk are packaged together in a
single functor HH = ⊕k≥0 HHk : SBimn → Q-vectZ×Z, where this latter category is the cate-
gory of bigraded vector spaces. The two gradings are the internal grading of the bimodule
(the m in the direct sum above), and the Hochschild cohomological grading k, which we call
the Hochschild grading.

Extending to complexes gives a functor HH : Cb(SBimn) → Cb(Q-vectZ×Z

). Given a com-
plex C, HH0(C) is the complex RHom(R, C) used to compute maps of all internal and homo-
logical degrees from the complex R (concentrated in a single homological degree) to C. The
homology of HH(C) and HH0(C) are denoted by HHH(C) and HHH0(C). When we wish
to emphasize the index n (which is not a degree, but the number of strands) we will write
HH(Rn; C), HH0(Rn; C), and so on.

BEN ELIAS AND MATTHEW HOGANCAMP

Note that HH(C) is triply graded. We will denote shifts in the tridegree by QiAjT k HH(C),
where Q is the usual degree, A is Hochschild degree, and T is homological degree. In pre-
vious sections we found it useful to introduce the variables (or grading shifts) t = T 2Q−2
and q = Q2. In the sequel it will prove convenient to package the Hochschild and q-degrees
together by introducing a = AQ−2. We write PC(q, a, t) for the Poincar´e series of HHH(C).
The experienced reader may wish to orient himself or herself by observing that in these

conventions, we have

PR1 =

1 + Q−2A
1 − Q2 =

1 + a
1 − q

which is the Hochschild cohomology of the ring Q[x] as a bimodule over itself. The reader
should think of (1− q)−1 as the Poincar´e series of Q[x] itself, and (1 + a) as the Poincar´e series
of the exterior algebra in one variable. Similarly, PRn = (1 + a)n(1 − q)−n.
Example 4.1. We have PBs = (1−Q2)−n(1+Q−2A)n−1(Q+Q−3A). Here is a brief conceptual
explanation. Consider the Koszul complex which resolves R by free R-bimodules. Applying
Hom to R, the differentials all become zero, yielding (1 + Q−2A)n times the Poincar´e series
of R, as for PR above. Applying Hom to Bs instead, one of the differentials in the Kozsul
complex is non-zero, becoming the middle differential in Example 2.21, except dualized.
Thus this differential yields a factor of (Q+Q−3A) instead. We will not use this computation.
Deﬁnition 4.2. We say that two complexes A, B ∈ Cb(SBimn) are HH-equivalent if HH(A) (cid:39)
HH(B) as complexes of triply graded vector spaces. In this case we will write A ∼ B.
The basic property of Hochschild cohomology which motivates its relationship with braid
closures is that HH(CD) ∼= HH(DC) whenever these tensor products make sense (e.g.
if
C, D ∈ C(SBimn) are simultaneously bounded above or below). Thus, any complex C is
HH-equivalent to F (β)CF (β−1) for any braid β.

Note that HHi can actually be viewed as a map from R-bimodules to the subcategory
of R-bimodules for which the left and right actions agree, which can be identiﬁed with R-
modules. However, the isomorphism HH(CD) ∼= HH(DC) is not an isomorphism of (com-
plexes of) R-bimodules, only of their underlying vector spaces. Nonetheless, there is still an
action of Rn on any Hochschild complex HHi(Rn; C).
Remark 4.3. The isomorphism HH(Rn; CD) ∼= HH(Rn; DC) of complexes of vector spaces
does actually lift to an isomorphism of modules over the invariant subring RSn.
4.2. The Markov move for Jones-Wenzl projectors. The Markov move states that the clo-
sure of a braid β on n− 1 strands is isotopic (as a link) to the closure of the braid σ±
n−1(β (cid:116) 11)
on n strands. To prove that HHH is a link invariant, Khovanov [Kho07b] proved a result
comparing HH(Rn−1; β) and HH(Rn; σ±
n−1(β (cid:116) 11)). In this paper, we will need a similar
result, comparing HH(Rn−1; Kn−1) and HH(Rn; Kn).
Proposition 4.4. Suppose that 2 ≤ n. Let C ∈ Cb(SBimn−1) be viewed as a complex in Cb(SBimn)
via the usual inclusion functor. We have
(4.1)
This can also be described as

HH(Rn; CKn) (cid:39) tn−1 HH(Rn−1; CKn−1) ⊕ a HH(Rn−1; CKn−1).

HH(Rn; CKn) (cid:39) tn−1 HH(Rn−1; CKn−1) ⊗ Λ[ξn]

where deg(ξn) = t1−na. Hence PCKn = (tn−1 + a)PCKn−1.

ON THE COMPUTATION OF TORUS LINK HOMOLOGY

Proof. We use results in [Hogb]. Let Cn denote the bounded derived category of graded
(Rn, Rn)-bimodules, where Rn = Q[x1, . . . , xn] as usual. Let Dn = Kb(Cn) denote the ho-
motopy category of Cn. Note that SBimn includes as a full subcategory of Cn, and Kb(SBimn)
includes as a full subcategory of Dn. In case n = 0, D0 is equivalent to the category QZ×Z×Z
of triply graded vector spaces.
There is a partial Hochschild cohomology functor Tn : Dn → Dn−1, such that HHH = T1 ◦ ··· ◦
Tn. These can be deﬁned as the right adjoints to the standard inclusions In : Dn−1 → Dn.
We usually abuse notation, and write C when we mean I(C). For each C ∈ Dn−1 and each
D ∈ Dn we have

T (CD) ∼= CT (D)

and

T (DC) ∼= T (D)C.

Recall from the proof of Proposition 2.18 that Kn (cid:39) Kn−1Qn, so that Tn(Kn) (cid:39) Kn−1Tn(Qn).
It was proven in §4 of [Hogb] that Tn(Qn) (cid:39) tn−1Pn−1 ⊗ Λ[ξn]. Since Kn−1Pn−1 (cid:39) Kn−1, we
conclude that
(4.2)
From this, the Lemma follows from the observation that HHH = T1 ◦ ··· ◦ Tn.

Tn(Kn) (cid:39) Kn−1T (Qn) (cid:39) tn−1Kn−1 ⊗ Λ[ξn].

(cid:3)

In our reduction algorithm to come, we need a relative version of the above proposition.
Corollary 4.5. Suppose that 2 ≤ (cid:96) ≤ n, with n = k + (cid:96). Let C ∈ Cb(SBimn−1) be viewed as a
complex in Cb(SBimn) via the usual inclusion functor. We have
(4.3)
Hence PC(1k(cid:116)K(cid:96)) = (t(cid:96)−1 + a)PC(1k(cid:116)K(cid:96)−1).
Proof. We picture the partial trace Tn : Dn → Dn−1 graphically as identifying the top right
and bottom right strands. The statement of the Lemma then becomes

HH(Rn; C(1k (cid:116) K(cid:96))) (cid:39) t(cid:96)−1 HH(Rn−1; C(1k (cid:116) K(cid:96)−1)) ⊗ Λ[ξ(cid:96)].

This corollary allows one to slowly shrink copies of K(cid:96) that appear, reducing the num-
ber of strands in the process. However, the case (cid:96) = 1 is separate; diagrammatically, this
corresponds to taking the complex C and adding a circle, since K1 is the identity.
Proposition 4.6. Let C ∈ Cb(SBimn−1) be viewed as a complex in Cb(SBimn) via the usual inclusion
functor. We have
(4.5)
where deg(ξ1) = Q−2A = a. Hence PC(cid:116)K1 = (1 − q)−1(1 + a)PC.
Proof. In general, HHH(A (cid:116) B) ∼= HHH(A) ⊗ HHH(B). So this proposition just amounts to
the observation that HHH(Q[xn]) ∼= Q[xn] ⊗ Λ[ξ1]. This may be pictured as

HH(Rn; C (cid:116) K1) (cid:39) HH(Rn−1; C) ⊗ Q[xn] ⊗ Λ[ξ1]

Results like these we will also call HH-equivalences.

Deﬁnition 4.7. We extend Deﬁnition 4.2 above to say that two complexes A ∈ Cb(SBimn)
and B ∈ Cb(SBimk) are HH-equivalent, written A ∼ B, if HH(A) (cid:39) HH(B) as complexes of
triply graded vector spaces. Note that n and k need not be equal. The complexes A and B
are allowed to have built-in formal Hochschild grading shifts.
4.3. Reduced complexes. Observe that the formulas for PC(1k(cid:116)K(cid:96)) for (cid:96) ≥ 2 and (cid:96) = 1 do
not follow the same pattern, as the (cid:96) = 1 case has an extra factor of (1 − q)−1. We will
need to use both (4.3) and (4.5) in our recursion for HHH(FTn), and the differences between
these two formulas lead to a bookkeeping nightmare. Instead, we will introduce the reduced
complexes ˆK(cid:96), which admit a streamlined formula which works for (cid:96) = 1 as well as for (cid:96) ≥ 2.
Deﬁnition 4.8. For each complex C ∈ K(SBimn) and each element f ∈ Rn of the ground ring,
let f IdC and IdC f denote the endomorphisms of C given by left and right multiplication by
f, respectively. Set ˆC := Cone(xn IdC).

Remark 4.9. Effectively, ˆC is the result of killing the left action of xn on C. Indeed, since Rn
acts freely on Soergel bimodules, standard arguments imply that ˆC (cid:39) C/xnC. Thus, one
may think of ˆC as a reduced version of C. The usual reduced complex is the mapping cone
on e1 IdC (equivalently, the quotient C/e1C), where e1 = x1 + ··· + xn. The two notions are
related, but generally different. Our sole reason for introducing ˆC is have a functorial way
of converting expressions involving Kn to expressions involving ˆKn.

The relationship between ˆKn and Kn is best understood as follows. Let Pn be the com-
plex introduced in [Hogb], whose deﬁnition is recalled in the proof of Proposition 2.18. Let
END(Pn) denote the bigraded ring spanned by all homogeneous chain maps QiT jPn → Pn
modulo homotopy. In [Hogb] the second author showed that END(Pn) ∼= Q[u1, u2, . . . , un],
where the uk are variables of bidegree deg(uk) = Q2kT 2−2k = qt1−k. In particular, u1 has
degree q, and is represented by left or right multiplication by xi ∈ R in the ground ring
(in [Hogb] it is shown that all such maps are homotopic; see also the proof of Lemma 4.10
below).
The complex Kn can be interpreted as the total complex of the Koszul complex associated
to the action of u2, . . . , un acting on Pn. Precisely: Kn (cid:39) Cone(u2)Cone(u3)··· Cone(un),
where concatenation denotes tensor product. This description clariﬁes the manner in which
our deﬁnition of Kn gives special treatment to the case n = 1. A more equitable construction
would also include a factor of Cone(u1). By our comments above, this is precisely what ˆKn
does: ˆKn (cid:39) Cone(u1)Cone(u2)··· Cone(un).
Lemma 4.10. We have ˆKn (cid:39) ˆK1Kn.
Proof. It is clear that ˆK1Kn = Cone(x1 IdKn), while ˆKn = Cone(xn IdKn) by deﬁnition. Thus,
it sufﬁces to prove that x1 IdKn (cid:39) xn IdKn, and the Lemma will follow by homotopy invari-
ance of mapping cones. It is a standard fact that there are canonical maps R(−1) → Bi and
Bi(−1) → R whose composition is αi := xi − xi+1. Thus, BiKn (cid:39) 0 implies that αi IdKn
factors through a contractible complex, hence is null-homotopic for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1. This
implies that x1 IdKn (cid:39) xn IdKn, and completes the proof.

lence ˆFTn (cid:39)(cid:76)

Remark 4.11. Applying the functor C (cid:55)→ ˆC to the result of Theorem 3.7 yields an equiva-
v∈{0,1}n−1 qk ˆDv·1 with twisted differential. Further, ˆDv·1 is given by the same

formula as Dv·1, except with K(cid:96) replaced by ˆK(cid:96).

Our next result will later be used to show that the computation of HHH(FTn) reduces to a

computation of HHH( ˆFTn). In particular PFTn = 1
Proposition 4.12. If C ∈ Cb(SBimn) is such that HHH( ˆC) is supported in even homological degrees,
then so is HHH(C), and HHH(C) ∼= Q[xn] ⊗ HHH( ˆC). In particular, if PC(q, a, t) denotes the
Poincar´e series of HHH(C), then

1−qP ˆFTn.

PC =

1
1 − q

P ˆC.

Proof. Consider a more general situation in which M is a chain complex on which some
polynomial ring Q[x] acts. Let Z denote the dg algebra Q[x, y, θ] with d(θ) = x− y, d(x) = 0,
and d(y) = 0. Here, θ is an odd variable, hence we assume that θ2 = 0. The differential
ensures that y (cid:39) x. More precisely, there is a chain map Z → Q[x] sending θ (cid:55)→ 0, x (cid:55)→ x,
and y (cid:55)→ x. This map is a homotopy equivalence Z → Q[x]. Further, the inverse map and
the relevant homotopies can all be chosen to be Q[x]-equivariant.
Consider the chain complex M(cid:48) (cid:39) Z ⊗Q[x] M. This is regarded as a dg Q[x]-module in a
slightly non-standard way, where x acts by multiplication by y on the ﬁrst tensor factor. The
above paragraph implies that there is a homotopy equivalence M(cid:48) (cid:39) M which commutes
the Q[x] actions up to homotopy. Now, M(cid:48) ∼= Q[y, θ] ⊗ M with twisted differential

• d(y ⊗ m) = y ⊗ d(m),
• d(θ ⊗ m) = y ⊗ m − 1 ⊗ xm − θ ⊗ d(m).

After rearranging, we see that M (cid:39) M(cid:48) (cid:39) Q[y] ⊗ ˆM with twisted differential, where ˆM de-
notes the “reduced complex” ˆM := Cone(M x→ M ). This construction is formally analogous
to the fact that if X is a topological space on which a group G acts, then there is a space X(cid:48)
on which G acts freely, such that X (cid:39) X(cid:48) via a G-equivariant homotopy equivalence.

Now we apply this construction to the case of interest. Since HH is a linear functor which
is extended to complexes, we have that HH commutes with mapping cones. In particular
HH( ˆC) is the mapping cone of xn acting on HH(C). The above construction then produces a
twisted differential on Q[xn] ⊗ HH( ˆC) such that the resulting complex is homotopy equiva-
lent to HH(C). Thus we may regard HH(C) as a convolution of complexes qk HH( ˆC), indexed
by k ∈ Z≥0. The result now follows by the parity miracle (Proposition 2.14). Strictly speak-
ing the parity miracle doesn’t directly apply, because the indexing set is not ﬁnite. To ﬁx this
problem we ﬁx r and consider the subcomplex of HH(C) consisting of chains with q-degree
r. Each of these is a convolution with only ﬁnitely many terms, since qk HH( ˆC) is supported
in large q-degrees for k large. Thus, the parity miracle can be applied separately to each
(cid:3)
q-degree. The details are straightforward, so we omit them.
Proposition 4.13. The complexes ˆKn satisfy the same recursion as Kn. That is:

Proof. For n ≥ 2 simply tensor (2.2) on the left with ˆK1 and use Lemma 4.10. For the some-
what degenerate case n = 1, the result follows from the following argument. Note that when
n = 1, the left hand side of (4.6) is Q[x1], and the second term on the right-hand side can
be identiﬁed with x1Q[x1]. Then the result follows from the observation that ˆK1 (cid:39) Q, and
Q[x1] ∼= Q ⊕ x1Q[x1].
(cid:3)

We have the following streamlined version of the Markov move for the reduced Jones-

Wenzl complexes.
Corollary 4.14. Suppose that 1 ≤ (cid:96) ≤ n, with n = k + (cid:96). Let C ∈ Cb(SBimn−1) be viewed as a
complex in Cb(SBimn) via the usual inclusion functor. We have

HH(Rn; C(1k (cid:116) ˆK(cid:96))) (cid:39) t(cid:96)−1 HH(Rn−1; C(1k (cid:116) ˆK(cid:96)−1)) ⊗ Λ[ξ(cid:96)]

(4.7)
where Λ denotes an exterior algebra, and deg ξi = t1−ia. Hence PC(1k(cid:116) ˆK(cid:96)) = (t(cid:96)−1+a)PC(1k(cid:116) ˆK(cid:96)−1).
Proof. For (cid:96) > 1 this follows by the same argument in the proof of Corollary 4.5. For (cid:96) = 1 this
follows from the fact that HH( ˆK1) is the mapping cone of x1 acting on HH(Q[x1]; Q[x1]) =
Q[x1] ⊗ Λ[ξ1]. Since x1 acts freely, standard arguments imply that this mapping cone is
(cid:3)
equivalent to the quotient Λ[ξ1], which has Poincare polynomial 1 + a.
Corollary 4.15. Let Λ = Λ[ξ1, . . . , ξn] be the exterior algebra. Let PΛ denote its Poincar´e polynomial.
Then P ˆKn

4.4. The complexes we use. Now let us return to the convolution description of the full
twist.
Deﬁnition 4.16. For each v ∈ {0, 1}n with k zeroes and (cid:96) ones, let Cv = Twv(FTk (cid:116) ˆK(cid:96)).
Recall that the shufﬂe twist Twv was described in Deﬁnition 2.4. Again, we identify a braid
with its Rouquier complex.

Example 4.17. If v = (0101100), then we have

Cv =

FT4

ˆK3

It is clear that Cv is conjugate to ˆDv, where Dv is as in Deﬁnition 3.5. These will be the

complexes we use in our inductive computation of Hochschild cohomology.

We now present a simple convolution recursion for HH(Cv).

Proof. This is simply the result of Proposition 2.6, followed by an isotopy.

To prove the Proposition, we must show that the term on the left is HH-equivalent to C1·v,

the left-handed crossing (rather, the cabled crossing between 1 strand and k parallel strands)
from the top to the bottom, through the full twist, where it meets and annihilates the right-
handed crossing. The resulting complex is C0·v. For the term on the left, we have the follow-

The ﬁrst equivalence is obtained by rewriting the full-twist as FTk+1 = FTk Jk+1, where Jk+1
is the Jucys-Murphy braid. The second is an HH-equivalence which slides the Jucys-Murphy
braid from the bottom to the top. The ﬁnal equivalence is an obvious isotopy. The braid
on the top of the resulting complex is Tw1·v (similar to the statement of Proposition 2.6 for
Twv·0). The resulting complex is therefore C1·v. Each of the above equivalences corresponds
to an honest homotopy equivalence after applying the functor HH(−). This completes the
(cid:3)
proof.
4.6. Our main result. In this section we prove our main theorem, which gives a recursion
formula for the Poincar´e series for HHH(Cv).
Proposition 4.21. There is a unique family of rational functions fv(q, a, t), indexed by binary se-
quences v ∈ {0, 1}n with n ∈ Z≥0, satisfying
(4.9a)

fv·1(q, a, t) = (t|v| + a)fv(q, a, t)
fv·0(q, a, t) = qf0·v + f1·v(q, a, t)

(4.9b)
together with f∅ = 1.
Proof. Let us ﬁrst prove uniqueness. Note that rule (3) applied to the sequence v = (00··· 0)
yields f00···0 = qf00···0 + f10···0. In other words:

(4.10)

f00···0 =

1
1 − q

f10···0,

Now, deﬁne a partial order on the set of binary sequences as follows: given v ∈ {0, 1}n

which we think of as our replacement for rule (3) when applied to the zero sequence.
and w ∈ {0, 1}m, write v < w if one of the following conditions is met:

• n < m
• n = m and v has fewer zeroes than w.
• n = m, v and w have the same number of zeroes, and number of inversions in the

shufﬂe permuation πv is less than the number of inversions in πw.

Then < deﬁnes a partial order on the set of binary sequences. The number of inversions in
πv is the number of pairs (i < j) where vi = 1 and vj = 0. Thus, 0 · v ≤ v · 0 with equality if
and only if v = (00··· 0). Clearly the empty sequence is the unique minimum with respect to
this partial order, and rules (2) and (3) express any fv in terms of fw with w < v. This proves
uniqueness.

ON THE COMPUTATION OF TORUS LINK HOMOLOGY

33

For existence, we need to prove consistency of the rules (1), (2), and (3). However, this is
(cid:3)

clear since for each v, exactly one of the rules (1), (2), (3), can be applied.

We now have our main theorem:

Theorem 4.22. The Poincar´e series for HHH(Cv) equals the rational function fv(q, a, t) from Propo-
sition 4.21. In particular, HHH(Cv) is supported in even homological degrees. As a special case we
have that HHH(FTn) = f00···0(q, a, t) is the Poincar´e series of the triply graded homology of the
(n, n) torus link, up to an overall shift.
Proof. Let Pv = PCv denote the Poincar´e series for HHH(Cv). We will show that Pv = fv by
induction on v, using the partial order on the set of binary sequences introduced in the proof
of Proposition 4.21.
In case v = ∅, we have C∅ = Q, which satisﬁes HHH(R0; Q) = HHH(Q; Q) = Q. Thus
P∅ = 1 = f∅.
Now, ﬁx v ∈ {0, 1}n, and assume by induction that Pw = fw for all w < v. If v = (00··· 0),
then P10···0 = f10···0 by induction. Further, C10···0 = ˆC00···0, so Proposition 4.12 says that
1−qP10···0, which equals f00···0 by (4.10). This takes care of the case where v is the
P00···0 = 1
zero sequence. Thus, we assume below that v is nonzero.
There are two cases: either v = w · 1 or w · 0 for some w. In the ﬁrst case, then Corollary
4.14 says that Pw·1 = (t|v| + a)Pw, hence Pw·1 = fw·1 by Equation (4.9a) and induction. Thus,
we may assume that v = w · 0. Since v is nonzero, we have 1 · w < w · 0 (fewer zeroes) and
0 · w < w · 0 (fewer inversions). Thus, by induction, we have P1·w = f1·w and P0·w = f0·w.
Also by induction, we may assume that HHH(C1·w) and HHH(C0·w) are supported in even
homological degrees. Thus, the terms of the convolution Proposition 4.20 have the same
parity after taking HHH. Proposition 2.14 implies that HHH(Cw·0) splits as a direct sum

HHH(Cw·0) ∼= q HHH(C0·w) ⊕ HHH(C1·w).

Taking Poincar´e series, we see that Pw·0 = qP0·w +P1·w. It follows that Pv = fv, by induction
(cid:3)
and the uniqueness statement of Proposition 4.21.

5. NUMEROLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS

Below, we give an alternate recursive formula for the power series fv(q, a, t) for sequences

v ∈ {0, 1}n. We then give a closed formula for a = 0 specialization f00···0(q, 0, t).
5.1. An alternate recursive formula. The recursion described in this section was actually
discovered before the recursion that appears in Proposition 4.21. We originally proved our
main result (Theorem 4.22) using this recursion, and later found a much more elegant route
which now appears in our §4.6. Nonetheless this alternate recursion is quite useful, and will
lead us to a closed formula for the a-degree zero part of HHH(FTn) in §5.3. We introduce
some combinatorial notions which will be relevant below.
Deﬁnition 5.1. Fix a sequence v ∈ {0, 1}n. We will call a pair of sequences (v, w) compatible
if w ∈ {0, 1}k, where k is the number of zeroes in v. If (v, w) is a compatible pair, we deﬁne a
sequence v ◦ w by “inserting w into the zeroes of v.” That is, let (v ◦ w)i = 1 if either vi = 1,
or if vi is the j-th zero in v and wj = 1. We let Iv,w ⊂ {1, . . . , n} denote the subset of indices
such that vi = 0 but (v ◦ w)i = 1. We say that i is a one in v if vi = 1, and i is a one in w (relative
to v) if vi = 0 but (v ◦ w)i = 1. When v is understood, we omit the phrase relative to v.
Example 5.2. Let v = (1101001) and w = (001). In this case we have v◦w = (1101011), where
the underlined terms indicate where we have inserted w into v.

Deﬁnition 5.3. Fix v ∈ {0, 1}n and w ∈ {0, 1}k as above. For each index i, let (cid:96)(i) denote
the number of ones of v strictly to the left of i, and let m(i) denote the number of ones in w
strictly to the right of i. Let Pv,w,i denote (t(cid:96)(i)+m(i) + a) if vi = 1 and Pv,w,i = 1 otherwise.
Lemma 5.4. The following relations hold:

(1) Pv·1,w = (t|v| + a)Pv,w
(2) Pv·0,w·0 = Pv,w
(3) P1·v,w = (t|w| + a)Pv·0,w·1.
(4) P0·v,0·w = Pv,w
(5) P0·v,1·w = Pv,w

Proof. These are easily veriﬁed directly from the deﬁnition.
Proposition 5.5. The functions fv(q, a, t) deﬁned in Proposition 4.21 can also be deﬁned by the
recursion:
(5.1a)

(cid:3)

(cid:88)

f00···0(q, a, t) = (1 − q)−1f10...0(q, a, t)
Pv,w(q, a, t)qk−|w|fw(q, a, t)

( if v (cid:54)= 0)

(5.1b)

fv(q, a, t) =

w∈{0,1}k
The base of the recursion is still f∅ = 1.

Note that we regard {0, 1}0 as the set containing the empty set. Thus, (5.1b) gives

f11···1(q, a, t) = P11···1,∅(q, a, t) =

n(cid:89)

(ti−1 + a)

as a special case.

i=1

First, note that gv·1 =(cid:80)

Proof. Both recursions uniquely pin down a collection of functions fv(q, a, t). Therefore, if
one of these deﬁnitions satisﬁes the other’s recursive formula, then they are equivalent def-
initions. The recursions are clearly equivalent when computing fv for sequences of length
n ≤ 1. Let us temporarily denote by gv the family of functions determined by (5.1a) and
(5.1b). We will show that the gv also satisfy the recursion which deﬁnes fv (Equations (4.9a)
and (4.9b)).
w∈{0,1}k Pv·1,wqk1gw where k1 is the number of zeroes in w. By part
(1) of Lemma 5.4, we have Pv·1,w = (t|v| + a)gw, which implies that gv·1 = (t|v| + a)gv. Thus,
the rule (4.9a) is satisﬁed by gv.
We now check that gv·0 satisﬁes (4.9b). If v = (00··· 0), then this translates precisely to rule
(5.1a), which we are assuming is valid. Thus, we may assume that v is nonzero. We must
show that gv·0 = qg0·v + g1·v. To do this, ﬁx v ∈ {0, 1}n, let (cid:96) = |v| the number of ones in v and
k = n − (cid:96) the number of zeroes. Below, we let k1 denote the number of zeroes in w, so that

(cid:88)

w

gv =

Pv,wqk1gw

Let us expand gv·0(q, a, t) using the rule (5.1b). Because of the extra zero, there are twice as
many terms in this sum as there were for gv, corresponding to sequences w · 0 and sequences
w · 1. We obtain

(cid:19)

gv·0 =

qk1

qPv·0,w·0gw·0 + Pv·0,w·1gw·1

.

(cid:18)

(cid:88)

ON THE COMPUTATION OF TORUS LINK HOMOLOGY

35

For the sequence w · 0 relative to w, there is an extra zero yielding an extra factor of q. By
Lemma 5.4, we have Pv·0,w·0 = Pv,w, and by rule (5.1a), we have gw·1 = (t|w| + a)gw. This
yields

(5.2)

gv·0 =

qk1

qPv,wgw·0 + (t|w| + a)Pv·0,w·1gw

.

Recall that we are assuming v is not the zero-sequence, hence k < n. Now we apply
induction on n, assuming (4.9a) and (4.9b) hold for gw. Applying both of these equations to
the right hand side of (5.2) we obtain

qk1

q2Pv,wg0·w + qPv,wg1·w + (t|w| + a)Pv·0,w·1gw

Lemma 5.4 says P0·v,0·w = Pv,w = P0·v,1·w and P1·v,w = (t|w| + a)Pv·0,w·1. Thus,
q2Pv,wg0·w + qPv,wg1·w + (t|w| + a)Pv·0,w·1gw

qg0·v + g1·v =

Comparing (5.3) to (5.4), we have shown that gv·0 = qg0·v + g1·v, as desired.

5.2. The redundancy of rule (5.1a).
Proposition 5.6. Equation (5.1a) follows from a verbatim application of Equation (5.1b) to the case
of the zero sequence v = (00··· 0).
Proof. Let v be the zero sequence of length n. When we expand f00···0 using Equation (5.1b) ,
we obtain a sum of 2n terms, indexed by sequences w ∈ {0, 1}n. We claim that the sum of the
terms with w ending in 1 is actually just f10···0; that the sum of the terms with w ending in 10
is actually just qf10···0; the sum of the terms with w ending in 100 is q2f10···0; and so forth. Of
course, the unique term where w ends in 10 · 0 (length n) is just qn−1f10···0, because qn−1 is
easy observed to be the coefﬁcient of f10···0 in this expansion.

Given this claim, we have

f00···0 = qnf00···0 + (1 + q + q2 + . . . + qn−1)f10···0,

which immediately implies Equation (5.1a). So it is enough to show the claim.

The claim is proven by an easy induction, using Equation (4.9b). For instance,

qn−2f10···0 = qn−1f010···0 + qn−2f110···0.

by one application of Equation (4.9b). These are the two terms which end in (10··· 0) (length
n − 1). This proves one statement of the claim. For the next, we apply Equation (4.9b) again
and decrease the power of q, obtaining

qn−3f10···0 = qn−1f0010···0 + qn−2(f1010···0 + f0110···0) + qn−3f1110···0.

These are the 4 terms which end in 10··· 0 (length n − 2), and each appears with the correct
power of q. This proves the second statement of our claim. The remaining parts of the claim
(cid:3)
follow by repeating this argument. We leave the details to the reader.

5.3. The closed form of HHH0(FTn). One useful consequence of the alternate recursion is
that it leads to a simple derivation of Theorem 1.9. To remind the reader, this theorem stated
that

f00···0(q, 0, t) =

ta(σ)+b(σ)qc(σ)

(cid:88)

σ

where the sum is over functions σ : {1, . . . , n} → Z≥0, and the integers a(σ), b(σ), c(σ) are
deﬁned by

(2) b(σ) is the number of pairs (i, j) ∈ {1, . . . , n} such that i < j and σ(j) = σ(i) + 1.

(cid:1)

(1) a(σ) =(cid:80)
(3) c(σ) =(cid:80)n

k≥0

i=1 σ(i).

Deﬁnition 5.7. Recall Deﬁnition 5.1. If (v, w) is a compatible pair of sequences, let c(v, w)
denote the number of pairs of indices i < j such that i is a one in v and j is a one in w (relative
to v).
Example 5.8. Let v = (1101000101) and w = (10110). In this case we have v◦w = (1111011101),
where the underlined terms indicate where we have inserted w into v. Then c(v, w) = 8. We
interpret c(v, w) as the number of crossings in a certain diagram associated to (v, w). First,
draw the shufﬂe permutation associated to v:

1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1

The 1’s in the sequence w tell us which strands corresponding to zeroes of v are “on.” We
will color green and red the strands which are “on” and “off,” respectively, in the case of
w = (10110):

1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1

Then c(v, w) is the total number of crossings between the 1-strands and the “on” 0-strands,
shown here as dots.

We now prove:

Lemma 5.9. Let v ∈ {0, 1}n be a sequence with (cid:96)0 ones and k0 = n − (cid:96)0 zeroes. The functions
fv(q, 0, t) satisfy the recursion f∅(q, 0, t) = 1 and

fv(q, 0, t) =

t((cid:96)0

2 )+c(v,w)qk1fw(q, 0, t)

(cid:88)

w∈{0,1}k0

where w has k1 zeroes.
Proof. Setting a = 0 in Deﬁnition 5.3, we see that Pv,w(q, 0, t) is the product of t(cid:96)(i)+m(i) over
all indices i such that vi = 1. The t(cid:96)(i) factors contribute t((cid:96)1
2 ) and the tm(i) factors contribute
tc(v,w). Thus, setting a = 0 in the alternate recursion Proposition 5.5 gives the statement. We
are also using the result of Proposition 5.6 in the special case where v is the zero sequence. (cid:3)
Proof of Theorem 1.9. Consider a sequence v = (v(0), v(1), . . . , ) of sequences v(r) ∈ {0, 1}n
for all i ∈ {1, . . . , n} and all r ≥ 0. Assume that v(r) = (1, 1, . . . , 1) for
such that v(r)

i ≤ v(r+1)

i

ON THE COMPUTATION OF TORUS LINK HOMOLOGY

37

r (cid:29) 0. Then v deﬁnes a function σ : {1, . . . , n} → Z≥0, where σ(i) is the smallest r such that
v(r)
i = 1. It is easy to see that this yields a bijection between sequences v and functions σ.
Let k(r) denote the number of zeroes of v(r), and let w(r) ∈ {0, 1}k(r) denote the sequence
such that w(0) = v(0) and v(r−1) ◦ w(r) = v(r) for r ≥ 1. Clearly this establishes a bijection
between increasing sequences v and eventually empty sequences w = (w(1), w(2), . . .) such
that (w(r), w(r+1)) are compatible for all r.

With these notions in place, we apply Lemma 5.9 to f(00···0) iteratively. After one applica-
tion, we see that f00···0 is a sum over sequences w(0) of fw(0), weighted by some monomials
in q and t. We apply the recursion again. The result can be viewed as a sum over sequences
w(0) and w(1) with (w(0), w(1)) compatible. Iterating indeﬁnitely, we see that f00···0 can be
expressed as a sum over all sequences w of some monomials in q and t. Using the bijection
between the w’s and the v’s, we regard this as a sum over all sequences v of some monomials
gv computed from v. We claim that gv = ta(σ)+b(σ)qc(σ), which would prove the theorem.
Suppose an index i is such that v(r−1) = 0 but v(r) = 1, with r ≥ 1. Then the t contribution
at the r-th step is tc(w(r−1),w(r))+(σ−1(r)
) by Lemma 5.9. Taking the product over all r ≥ 1
Finally, the number of zeroes in w(r) of indices i such that σ(i) > r, that is,(cid:80)
accounts for the factor of ta(σ)+b(σ).
s>r |σ−1(s)|.
Each of these contributes a factor of q. Taking the product over all r ≥ 0 yields q to the power

APPENDIX A. MISCELLANEOUS COMPUTATIONS

In this appendix we illustrate the usefulness of our method with a few computations of
triply graded homology for certain torus knots. For the reader’s convenience we present our
results with the proper normalization, and we state how to obtain classical invariants from
them.
Let Pβ(Q, A, T ) denote the Poincar´e series of HHH(F (β)), where Q, A, T denote the usual
quantum degree, homological degree, and Hochschild degree, respectively. This Pβ is an
invariant of the braid closure L = ˆb up to multiplication by a unit in Z[A±, Q±, T ±]. The
precise normalization which yields a link invariant requires that we introduce half-integral
powers of A and T :

PL(Q, A, T ) = T −e(β)Qn(Q−1A1/2T 1/2)e(β)−nPβ(Q, A, T ),

where e(β) is the braid exponent (signed number of crossings). The decategoriﬁcation corre-
sponds to specializing T = −1. To avoid choosing a square root of −1, we ﬁrst rewrite PL in
terms of Q, T , and the Homﬂy variable α = A1/2T 1/2Q−1:

PL(Q, α, T ) := T −e(β)Qnαe(β)−nPβ(Q, α, T ).

We call PL the super polynomial. Setting T = −1 recovers the Homﬂy polynomial in variables
α, Q. The slN specialization is then obtained by setting α = QN . For reference, the invariant
of the unknot is

PU (Q, α, T ) =

α−1 + αT −1
Q−1 − Q

.

38

BEN ELIAS AND MATTHEW HOGANCAMP

Recall that we prefer the variables t = T 2Q−2, q = Q2, a = AQ−2. Thus, we will usu-
√−1, then one should also
ally rewrite PL in terms of these variables. The decategoriﬁcation is obtained by setting
set a1/2(tq)1/4 = −α. For knots, it turns out that the reduced superpolynomial (cid:101)PL(q, a, t) :=
t1/2 = −q−1/2; if one wishes to avoid working in a ring with

PL(q, a, t)/PU (q, a, t) is a Laurent polynomial in q1/2, a, t1/2, so no technical issue arises from
the decategoriﬁcation t1/2 (cid:55)→ −q−1/2. The slN specialization is then obtained by setting
a = −qN . The following computations were all done by hand. We omit their derivations, in
the interest of readability and length.
Example A.1. The reduced superpolynomial of the (2, 2k + 1) torus knot is
tk + qtk−1 + ··· + qk + a(tk−1 + qtk−2 + ··· + qk−1)

ak(tq)−k/2

(cid:19)

(cid:18)

In particular, the superpolynomial of the right-handed trefoil—that is, the (2, 3) torus knot—
is a(tq)−1/2(q + t + a). The decategoriﬁcation is −a(q + q−1 + a), and the slN specialization is
qN−1 + qN +1 − q2N .
Example A.2. The reduced superpolynomial of the (3, 4) torus knot is

(cid:18)
q−3 + q−1 + 1 + q + q3 + a(q−2 + q−1 + 1 + q + q2) + a2(cid:17)

The decategoriﬁcation is

Setting a = −q2 and tq = 1 gives the correct sl2 specialization (Jones polynomial):

.

Observation A.5. Each of the above polynomials is symmetric with respect to exchanging q
and t. Further, the smallest a-degree summands of the Poincar´e series of the (n, n + 1) torus
knots are the q, t Catalan numbers, for n = 2, 3, 4. This veriﬁes a conjecture in [GORS14] in
these cases.
