ABSTRACT

We have developed a method for simulating the mesoscale compaction of early solar system solids
in low velocity impact events, using the iSALE shock physics code. Chondrules are represented by
nonporous disks, placed within a porous matrix. By simulating impacts into bimodal mixtures over
a wide range of parameter space (including the chondrule-to-matrix ratio, the matrix porosity and
composition and the impact velocity), we have shown how each of these parameters inﬂuences the
shock processing of heterogeneous materials. The temperature after shock processing shows a strong
dichotomy: matrix temperatures are elevated much higher than the chondrules, which remain largely
cold. Chondrules can protect some matrix from shock compaction, with shadow regions in the lee
side of chondrules exhibiting higher porosity that elsewhere in the matrix. Using the results from
this mesoscale modelling, we show how the ε − α porous compaction model parameters depend on
initial bulk porosity. We also show that the timescale for the temperature dichotomy to equilibrate
is highly dependent on the porosity of the matrix after the shock, and will be on the order of seconds
for matrix porosities of less than 0.1, and on the order of 10’s to 100’s seconds for matrix porosities of
∼ 0.3–0.5. Finally, we have shown that the composition of the post-shock material is able to match
the bulk porosity and chondrule-to-matrix ratios of meteorite groups such as carbonaceous chondrites
and unequilibrated ordinary chondrites.

INTRODUCTION

Primitive solar system solids are expected to have accu-
mulated as bimodal mixtures of mm-scale zero-porosity
inclusions (chondrules) surrounded by highly porous,
sub-µm dust particles (matrix). Previous numerical sim-
ulations of impact processing (e.g. compaction and heat-
ing) of such materials have treated the mixture as ho-
mogeneous and estimated impact-generated bulk shock
pressures and temperatures over large (i.e. planetesimal)
scales (e.g. Keil et al. 1997; Davison et al. 2010). To
model the bimodal mixtures explicitly, and resolve shock
response at the scale of individual chondrules, requires a
diﬀerent numerical approach known as mesoscale model-
ing (e.g., Nesterenko 2001). By adopting this approach,
Bland et al. (2014a) revealed new insight into the het-
erogeneous response of chondritic precuror material to
impact-induced compaction.

Williamson & Berry (1986) ﬁrst introduced “microlevel
numerical modeling” and showed how a shock wave af-
fects a small unit cell of closest packed cylinders of stain-
less steel, with void or air in the interstitial spaces; that
work conﬁrmed the experimental result that there is a
concentration of heating at the particle boundaries due
to the localisation of plastic deformation. Williamson
et al. (1989) extended this model to include a second
material. However, this work still only simulated a small
cell, which could not provide any information about the
material on a larger scale. To extend this type of model-
ing to investigate the bulk eﬀects of shock waves on het-
erogenous materials, Eulerian ﬁnite element simulations
of impacts into randomly packed particles were devel-

oped (Benson 1994; Benson et al. 1997), and were found
to reproduce averaged values of pressure, density and
porosity in close agreement with stationary shock exper-
iments into granular materials. This approach has now
become widely adopted for characterising the shock re-
sponse of granular materials (e.g. Borg & Vogler 2008,
2012), including constructing bulk-material Hugoniot re-
lationships and equations of state.

Mesoscale modeling has also been used for planetary
impact applications. Simulations of impact crater growth
on asteroids have investigated the eﬀects of target grain
size and heterogeneous materials (Barnouin-Jha et al.
2002; Crawford & Barnouin-Jha 2003). The conse-
quences of the presence of water ice on Mars has been
investigated by modeling rock/ice mixtures using a range
of geometries, including modeling ice inclusions within
a rock matrix (Ivanov 2005; Ivanov & Pierazzo 2011).
More recently, G¨uldemeister et al. (2013) simulated the
mesoscale response of porous and water-saturated ma-
terials and found good agreement with both macroscale
models (where the porosity was parameterised and the
water-saturated material was described by a mixed-
material equation of state) and Hugoniot data from shock
experiments, for both regularly and randomly distributed
pores. Finally, Bland et al. (2014a) applied mesoscale
modeling techniques to the scenario of shock process-
ing of primitive materials, by explicitly modeling shock
wave propagation through a mixture of non-porous chon-
drules distributed within a porous matrix. That work
showed that the heterogeneous nature of primitive me-
teoritic material leads to strong dichotomies in the tem-

peratures experienced by the two diﬀerent components:
Porous matrix was heated to > 1000 K by impact veloc-
ities of ∼ 1.5 km s−1, while the non-porous chondrules
were only heated by tens of Kelvin. Here, we describe
the modeling techniques used by Bland et al. (2014a) in
more detail, including a sensitivity analysis, and expand
the parameter space of the simulations presented in that
work.

Using the results of this mesoscale modeling, we then
determine: (1) how the parameters of the ε − α porous
compaction model (W¨unnemann et al. 2006; Collins et al.
2011) depend on the initial bulk porosity for diﬀerent
chondrule-matrix mixtures; (2) the timescale for equili-
bration of the temperature between the matrix and the
chondrules; and (3) that the porosities and chondrule
abundances of the post-shock material are able to match
those of chondritic meteorite groups.

2. METHODS

2.1. The iSALE Shock Physics Code

To quantify the compaction of porous meteoritic ma-
terial in an impact we used the iSALE shock physics
code (Collins et al. 2004; W¨unnemann et al. 2006), a
multi-material, multi-rheology extension of the SALE hy-
drocode (Amsden et al. 1980). iSALE incorporates sev-
eral additions to the original SALE code, including an
elasto-plastic constitutive model, fragmentation models,
various equations of state (EoS), and multiple materials
(Melosh et al. 1992; Ivanov et al. 1997). Recent additions
include a modiﬁed strength model (Collins et al. 2004)
and a porosity compaction model (W¨unnemann et al.
2006; Collins et al. 2011). iSALE has been benchmarked
against other hydrocodes (Pierazzo et al. 2008) and val-
idated against laboratory impact experiments (e.g. Pier-
azzo et al. 2008; Davison et al. 2011) for crater forma-
tion applications. In Bland et al. (2014b), we performed
a suite of two-dimensional (2D) plane-strain, mesoscale
simulations of shock wave propagation through a bimodal
mixture of non-porous chondrules (represented as 2D
disks) surrounded by a highly porous continuous matrix.
Here we describe and justify the methodology used in
that work and supplement those results with several ad-
ditional simulation suites to expand the physical parame-
ter space of our results and to demonstrate the sensitivity
of results to model choices.

Chondritic meteorites contain (nominally) non-porous
spherical chondrules (∼ 0.1–1 mm in diameter) sur-
rounded by a highly porous matrix composed of sub-µm
particles. Because the length scale of these two compo-
nents is so diﬀerent (approximately three orders of mag-
nitude), we chose to simulate the bimodal mixture by
explicitly resolving the chondrules as non-porous (2D)
disks, and modeling the porous matrix as a continuum.
The compaction of the matrix porosity was computed
using the ε − α porous-compaction model (W¨unnemann
et al. 2006; Collins et al. 2011), because the length-
scale of the porosity implied that it was too small to
be resolved in the simulation. ANEOS-derived tabu-
lar equations of state were used to describe the chon-
drules and the matrix.
In all cases, the ANEOS table
for dunite/forsterite (Benz et al. 1989) was used for the
chondrules. The solid component of the matrix was de-
scribed by either the dunite/forsterite ANEOS table, or

an ANEOS table for serpentine, created using param-
eters listed in Brookshaw (1998). The response of the
chondrules and matrix to changes in deviatoric stress
was calculated using a geologic strength model (Collins
et al. 2004). Chondrules were assigned a high cohesive
strength of 1 GPa, while the matrix was assumed to be
very weak (cohesive strength of 0.1 MPa; see Table 1
for all the iSALE material input parameters used in this
work).

2.2. Simulation Design

The bimodal mixture of chondrules and matrix was
generated by randomly placing circular disks of the chon-
drule material throughout the computational mesh. The
diameters of the disks were randomly distributed in the
size range 0.3–1 mm, based on typical chondrule sizes
(Scott & Krot 2003). Chondrules were added in this way
until the desired chondrule-to-matrix volume ratio was
reached, and the interstitial space was ﬁlled with matrix
material. Chondrule-to-matrix fraction was quantiﬁed
by matrix abundance, Ami, the initial matrix volume as
a percentage of the total; Ami varied between 30% and
70%, which was found a posteriori to account for the
observed range in current matrix abundance observed in
chondritic meteorites (Scott & Krot 2003). The initial
matrix porosity was typically 0.7, although some simula-
tions examined the eﬀect of changing this to 0.6 or 0.8.
The initial temperature was 300 K in all simulations pre-
sented here; some test simulations were run with diﬀerent
starting temperatures (down to 170 K), but as these sim-
ulations resulted in the same increase in temperature as
those reported here, for brevity, only 300 K simulations
are discussed below and only absolute temperatures are
reported.

To generate a shock or impact-induced compaction
wave in the simulated chondritic precursor material, nu-
merical planar impact experiments were performed in
which a ﬂyer plate impacted a target, comprising a sam-

bimodal mixture of explicitly resolved non-porous chondrules surrounded by a high-porosity matrix (Ami = 70%, φmi = 0.7, vi = 2 km s−1).
The far left hand panel shows the initial distribution of chondrules (light grey) and matrix (dark grey). The colour-scale for the right panels
of each of the remaining images denotes the instantaneous stress; the colour-scale for the left panels denotes the temperature. Upon impact,
shockwaves are generated at the ﬂyer-sample interface and propagate both down into the sample and up into the ﬂyer plate, compacting
the matrix. In this example, after approximately 14.8 µs the shockwave in the sample has reached the sample/buﬀer plate interface; by
this time the shock in the ﬂyer plate has reﬂected oﬀ the rear of the ﬂyer plate as a release wave that propagates back through the ﬂyer,
sample and buﬀer plates. By 32 µs the release wave has left the computational domain and the post-shock state of the sample may be
recorded. The variation in peak pressure, peak and post-shock temperature experienced by both the chondrules and matrix was recorded
for subsequent analysis as was the reduction in porosity in the matrix. See text for details.

ple sandwiched between a cover plate above and a buﬀer
plate below. The ﬂyer, cover, sample and buﬀer plates
were all composed of the same bimodal mixture of non-
porous chondrule disks, surrounded by a high porosity
matrix, to eliminate any unwanted wave reﬂections. The
presence of a cover plate allowed the planar shock wave to
achieve a steady form before passing through the sample
and then the adjacent buﬀer plate.

Figure 1 shows the propagation of a shock wave in a
typical simulation from this study. The ﬁrst panel (on
the left) shows the initial make up of the numerical ex-
periment: the ﬂyer plate at the top of the mesh (extend-
ing out the top of the image shown), which impacts the
cover plate. This generates a shock wave that travels
into both the ﬂyer and cover plates (second panel). At
early times (t ≈ 3 µs in Fig. 1), the shock front is un-
steady owing to grain-scale reverberations, which tend to
diﬀuse the shock front thickness over a distance related
to the grain diameter. In the simulations presented here,
the shock front thickness was typically ∼2 chondrule di-
ameters, consistent with front thicknesses determined by
mesoscale simulations of granular material compaction
(Benson et al. 1997). A consequence of this initial in-
crease in shock front thickness is that shock compaction
(and hence peak pressure) is greatest at the impact plane
and decays with distance until a steady shock wave is
achieved. This is evidenced by a gradient in porosity
in the cover (and ﬂyer) plate near the interface between
them (Fig. 2).

A thickness of the cover plate of several chondrule
diameters was chosen to ensure that the shock wave
was steady when it entered the sample. Hence, by the
time the shock wave propagated into the sample plate
(t = 7 µs in Fig. 1), it had achieved a constant shock
front thickness and rise time, which resulted in no gradi-
ent in compaction within the sample (see Figure 2).

Figure 2. Porosity ﬁeld in the cover and sample plates after shock
compaction. White lines on the left denote the boundary between
the ﬂyer and cover plates (top), the cover and sample (middle)
and the sample and buﬀer plate (bottom); the average position of
these boundaries are shown by the red, green and blue lines on
the right, respectively. The panel on the right shows the average
porosity in the matrix along horizontal strips, 5 computational cells
wide (error bars show 1-σ variations). In the cover plate, there is a
gradient in the porosity, rising from 0.04 at the ﬂyer plate boundary
to 0.08 at the sample plate boundary. In the sample, there is no
systematic porosity gradient, just local variations, showing that
the shock wave has reached a steady state.

Despite achieving a steady wave amplitude and shock
front thickness, the propagating shock wave exhibited
resonant oscillations around the steady wave amplitude,
caused by the mesoscale structure of the chondrule-
matrix mixture. Such oscillations have been noted in

previous models of shock compaction of porous granu-
lar materials (e.g. Trott et al. 2007) and porous rocks
(G¨uldemeister et al. 2013). They have also been observed
in laboratory experiments of layered composites of ‘hard’
and ‘soft’ materials (e.g. Zhuang et al. 2003). These ex-
periments revealed that the magnitude and duration of
the oscillations depends on the impedance mismatch be-
tween the components in the system (Zhuang et al. 2003),
which is very large for the chondrule – matrix system
studied here. It is these violent oscillations that result in
heterogeneous heating of the matrix within the sample
(Bland et al. 2014b).

The dimensions of the ﬂyer plate were designed such
that the release wave generated when the shock wave re-
ﬂected oﬀ the rear end of the ﬂyer plate did not reach the
sample plate material until the shock front had already
propagated through the entire sample region (t = 14.8 µs
in Fig. 1). The simulation time extended until the sam-
ple was released from high pressure by a release wave
from the rear of the ﬂyer plate (t = 32 µs inFigure 1).

2.3. Diagnosis of Bulk and Component Response

In all

simulations, Lagrangian tracer particles
monitored the response to shock wave passage of
computational-cell-sized parcels of material. This com-
plete record of material history allowed us to construct
the response to shock of the individual components
(chondrule and matrix) and the bulk material, as well
as to document spatial variations in response within the
chondrules and insterstitial matrix. The tracer particles
were placed throughout the computational mesh (one
tracer per cell) at the beginning of the simulation. These
particles then tracked the movement of that volume of
material throughout the simulation. The advantage of
using Lagrangian tracers here, rather than the Eulerian
cell-based quantities, it that they can record both the
pressure, temperature and porosity at each timestep, and
the peak temperature and pressure that each tracer ex-
perienced during the entire simulation. Using the cell-
based quantities alone would not allow us to track the
material’s history, and thus the peak quantities.

In post-processing, each bulk property (ﬁnal and peak
temperature; ﬁnal and peak pressure; porosity) in the
sample was calculated as the volume-weighted average
of that variable for all the tracers in the sample plate be-
hind the shock wave (using the tracer volume at the ﬁnal
time). We used a tracer’s location to diagnose whether
it had been shocked or not: once the tracer started mov-
ing (i.e.
its displacement was greater than a threshold
value), it was determined to be behind the shock wave.
The tracer records also allowed the properties of the in-
dividual components (matrix and chondrules) to be cal-
culated, as each tracer represented only one of the two
components (see Tables 2 and 3). Values of post-shock
temperature and porosity were recorded just after the re-
lease wave had passed through the sample mixture (e.g.,
∼ 32 µs in Figure 1). Hence, these temperatures repre-
sent the temperature of the material immediately after
the passage of the shock and release waves, but prior to
the (likely rapid) equilibration of heat between the ma-
trix and chondrules, which is not accounted for in our
models and is discussed later (Section 4.2).

A consequence of the heterogeneity of the sample is
that the shock wave is also heterogenous, and thus the

peak shock pressure recorded by any tracer throughout
the duration of shockwave passage can be substantially
higher than the instantaneous bulk shock pressure at any
time. For example, in the simulation shown in Figure 1,
the average bulk shock pressure in the shockwave was ap-
proximately 3.0 GPa and yet the mean peak shock pres-
sure experienced by chondrule and matrix material in the
sample was 6.5 GPa and 8.4 GPa respectively. This can
be seen in Figure 3, which shows the variation in pressure
within the shock wave at three diﬀerent timesteps. The
line graphs show the average pressure along each row of
computational cells, with the 1-σ variation in pressure
denoted by the blue shaded region. Within the shock
wave, these average pressures can vary by as much as 2
GPa within a space of 5 mm. This behaviour has been
observed previously in models of compaction of porous
sandstone, where a peak pressure was recorded of up to 4
times greater than the bulk pressure (G¨uldemeister et al.
2013).

2.3.1. Lagrangian tracer motion

Due to the large number of mixed-material computa-
tional cells in these simulations with many small particles
supported in a continuous matrix, it is important to make
sure that the Lagrangian tracers used to track material
history stay with their respective materials. The stan-
dard approach in iSALE is to move tracers through the
computational mesh using velocities interpolated from
the surrounding nodal velocities. However, it was found
that in mixed cells, some tracers “drifted” into neigh-
bouring materials (e.g. chondrule tracers ended up in
a cell full of matrix, etc.). To address this problem, a
new method of calculating tracer velocities was devised
using material volume ﬂuxes. This is documented fully
in Appendix A.

Figure 4 shows a comparison of a simulation run us-
ing the old (velocity) method and the new (material)
method. Note that in areas where chondrules (black trac-
ers) have collided, in the velocity method some matrix
tracers have drifted into the chondrules, whereas in the
material method, all tracers respect the material bound-
aries. The new material method is used throughout the
work presented here.

2.4. Resolution

Simulations were run at various resolutions, ranging
from a mean value of 40 cells per particle radius (cppr)
to 2.5 cppr (cell sizes of 12.5 µm to 200 µm), with an
identical particle distribution and number of tracer par-
ticles in each simulation (Figure 5). The mean pressure
converges at around 10 cppr (Figure 6), but diﬀerences
in the shock speed and structure within the shock are
still discernible between 10 and 20 cppr (Figure 5d &
5e). The mean porosity converges at around 20 cppr.

The error bars on Figure 6 show the standard deviation
in pressure in that simulation (they are not a measure of
model error). For simulations with a resolution of at least
5 cppr, the mean pressures all fell within the 1-σ variation
in pressure for all other resolutions; the same is true for
porosity for simulations with 10cppr or above (a similar
trend is seen for temperature). As a compromise between
computational expense and time, a mean particle radius
of 20 cppr was used for the remainder of this study.

shaded region shows the 1-σ variation in pressure along each row of cells. At any given time, the pressure in the shock wave can vary by
several GPa, on lengthscales of a few millimetres.

Figure 4. A comparison of the two methods in iSALE for mov-
ing tracers during a timestep. The velocity method (left) allows
tracers to drift out of their respective materials, whereas the new
material-based method (right) respects material boundaries. Note
that where some tracers appear to have crossed the material bound-
ary in the material method, they are in mixed-material cells (i.e. a
cell with a material boundary in it) and thus are still attached to
their respective material — this is just a result of how the material
boundary contours were drawn while constructing the ﬁgure.

2.5. Shock Duration

The duration of the shock pulse in the simulations pre-
sented below (Section 3 and Tables 2 and 3) (i.e. the time
from shock to release) ranges from 30 to 80 µs (90% of
the simulations presented here have a shock duration of
at least 40 µs). It should be noted that this shock du-
ration is signiﬁcantly lower than the duration expected
on a meteorite parent body during an impact event, but
longer than the shock durations that are possible in typ-

ical gas-gun experiments. To investigate the shock dura-
tion required in order to reach a steady state (and thus
allow any simulation results to be applied to the larger
planetesimal scale), a simulation was run of two collid-
ing 120 mm long impactors, with a similar composition
to that shown in Figure 1 and a mutual impact velocity
of 1 km s−1. For all tracers, the time of the shock wave
arrival and the time of release were recorded; from these
measurements, the shock duration experienced by each
tracer was calculated. The mean and standard devia-
tion of the peak pressure, ﬁnal porosity and ﬁnal tem-
perature among those tracers in the shock were recorded
as a function of shock duration. Figure 7 shows that

simulations shown in Figure 5.
for shock durations of 20–30 µs or longer, the porosity,
pressure and temperature measured in the simulation
has reached a steady state. This suggests that the re-
sults presented here should apply to impacts over a large
range of scales (with longer shock durations) including
planetesimal-scale collisions.

3. RESULTS

The response of the bimodal mixture of chondrules and
matrix to a shock wave was simulated using the tech-
niques described in Section 2. In Section 3.1, the model
shown in Figure 1 is documented in detail. In the sub-
sequent sections (3.2 – 3.5), a wide parameter space is
explored (impact velocity, matrix fraction, matrix poros-
ity and matrix material) and results compared to those
of this reference model (see also Tables 2 and 3).

The range of impact velocities we consider here is 0.75
– 3 km s−1. While the average collision velocity in the
main asteroid belt today is ∼ 5 km s−1, dynamical mod-
els of terrestrial planet formation and planetesimal colli-
sional histories (O’Brien et al. 2006, 2007; Davison et al.
2013) show that in the ﬁrst million years of solar system
evolution the mean collision velocity of planetesimals was
likely < 3 km s−1. The velocities range simulated here
was also chosen to give post-compaction matrix abun-
dances and porosities consistent with carbonaceous and
ordinary chondrites (see Section 4.3).

3.1. Mesoscale Response to Shock of Bimodal Mixtures
Figure 1 depicts the evolution of a simulation we use as
a reference in discussing our results. In that simulation
the impact velocity vi = 2 km s−1, the matrix fraction
Ami = 70% and the initial matrix porosity φmi = 0.7.
The left hand panel depicts the initial model setup. A
ﬂyer plate impacts a cover plate at vi, sending a shock-
wave into both the cover plate and the ﬂyer (3 µs). At

7 µs, the shockwave enters the sample plate (the region
over which the statistical analysis will be performed). At
14.8 µs, the shockwave reaches the back edge of the sam-
ple, and enters a buﬀer plate (the purpose of which is
to prevent the generation of a release wave at this loca-
tion). Also at this time, a release wave is formed at the
top edge of the ﬂyer, which starts to move though the
ﬂyer towards the cover and sample. By 32 µs, the entire
sample has been released from high pressure.

In Figure 8 the diﬀerences between the chondrules and
matrix are highlighted for the reference simulation. The
peak pressures in the chondrules range from ∼ 4 to 11
GPa, with a mean of 6.5 GPa, and in the matrix from
4 to 16 GPa, with a mean of 8.4 GPa. The pressure
is higher in the matrix than in the chondrules, due to
the large strength diﬀerence between the two compo-
nents (the longitudinal stress, however, is the same in
both components). Both the peak-shock and post-shock
temperatures in the chondrules are low (between 300 K
and 500 K) compared to temperatures in the matrix (900

K to > 1500 K). The chondrules begin with no porosity,
and that is not changed in the shock event; the matrix
begins with a porosity of 0.7, and is reduced to a range
of 0 – 0.2 porosity in the shock event, with a mean of
0.07. The bulk porosity, φbf is compacted from 0.5 be-
fore the impact to 0.03 after the impact, and the abun-
dance of matrix decreases from 70% to 45% as a result of
that compaction. The location of the residual porosity is
shown in the top row of Figure 9, and appears as shadow
regions on the lee side of the chondrules (the shock di-
rection was down the page), where material is somewhat
protected from the shock and compaction is incomplete.

3.2. Eﬀect of Impact Velocity, vi

Figure 9 shows the eﬀect of changing the velocity from
the model shown in Section 3.1: The top row shows an
impact at 1 km s−1, the middle row shows an impact at
1.5 km s−1 and the bottom row shows the model shown
previously (vi = 2 km s−1). Increasing the velocity in-
creases the peak pressures throughout both the matrix
and chondrules. The peak temperatures are signiﬁcantly
higher in the matrix with increasing velocity, while the
increase in chondrule temperatures is more modest. As
shown in Tables 2 and 3, these trends persist for other
combinations of initial matrix fraction, porosity and ma-

terial. The incomplete compaction seen in the reference
simulation (top row of Fig. 9) is also seen at lower veloc-
ities; in these cases, even less pore space is compacted,
and the shadow regions are larger.

Also evident is an increase in chondrule deformation
with impact speed (Fig. 9). At 1 km s−1 the chon-
drules retain their circular shapes whilst at 2 km s−1
many chondrules are shortened in the direction of shock
or inter-chondrule collision.

Figure 10 shows how the bulk material and the in-
dividual components respond to the shock for a range
of velocities from 0.75 km s−1 to 3 km s−1, including
the simulations described in this section and Figure 9

(Ami = 70%, φmi = 0.7). The bulk response of the mix-
ture (solid symbols), calculated as the volume-weighted
mean of peak pressure, peak temperature and porosity
over all sample tracers, is in good agreement with an es-
timate of the Hugoniot curve for the bulk material calcu-
lated using the equation of state and the ε–α porous com-
paction model (for details of this calculation, see Davison
et al. 2010). However, the peak pressures and tempera-
tures experienced by the individual components are very
diﬀerent from the bulk response, particularly at high im-
pact speeds. For vi ≥ 2 km s−1, both the chondrules and
matrix see shock pressures 2–4 times higher than those
recorded for the bulk material: This is due to a diﬀer-

Compaction of primitive solar system solids

3.3. Eﬀect of Initial Matrix Fraction, Ami

Simulations were run with initial matrix fractions rang-
ing from Ami = 30% to Ami = 80%. Higher matrix
fraction reduces the bulk density and increases the bulk
porosity of the impactor and sample material. As shown
in Figure 11, this implies that a decrease in the initial
matrix fraction leads to an increase in peak pressures,
at ﬁxed impact speed, and consequently higher peak and
ﬁnal temperatures in both the matrix and chondrules.
However, the bulk temperature decreases slightly by ∼20
K over this range in Ami for vi = 2 km s−1, because the
increased volume fraction of cold chondrules reduces the
average temperature.

Final matrix porosity appears to be inﬂuenced by two
competing processes that depend on matrix abundance
and impact speed. At low speeds, as matrix abundance
decreases, shock pressures are higher, and thus more
compaction occurs, leading to lower porosity. However,
at velocities high enough for chondrules to come into con-
tact with each other, the porous matrix can be shielded
from the shock eﬀects by stress bridges between chon-
drules, and is compacted less. Chondrule contact be-
comes more prevalent and occurs at lower impact speeds
when the matrix abundance is low. For example, at
1 km s−1 impact speed, the ﬁnal matrix porosity de-
creases with decreasing matrix abundance (compaction
dominated), owing to the higher shock pressures that the
matrix experiences. At 2 km s−1, the ﬁnal matrix poros-
ity increases as the initial matrix abundance decreases
(i.e., there is less compaction when there are more chon-
drules; stress-bridging dominated), due to the matrix
being sheltered in the interstitial spaces between chon-
drules (bottom left frame of Figure 11). At an interme-
diate velocity, both of these competing processes (com-
paction and stress-bridging) can be seen: At 1.5 km s−1,
the porosity ﬁrst decreases with decreasing matrix abun-
dance, and then increases (see Table 2).

3.4. Eﬀect of Initial Matrix Porosity, φmi

Figure 12 shows the eﬀect of the initial matrix porosity
on the peak pressure, peak temperature and ﬁnal poros-
ity, for impacts at 2 km s−1 and a matrix abundance of
Ami = 70%. As we would expect, as the initial porosity
increases, the peak pressures in both the chondrules and
the matrix decrease, due to the reduction in bulk den-
sity. The lower pressures in the non-porous chondrules
lead to lower temperatures. However, as the matrix has
experienced enhanced compaction (and thus there is ad-
ditional waste heat in the matrix), the resulting matrix
temperatures are higher. In the cases shown in Figure 12,
this leads to an increase in the bulk temperature. With a
lower initial matrix abundance, a lower bulk temperature
could be the result. The trends in pressure and temper-
ature are the same for the lower velocity simulations at
1 km s−1 shown in Tables 2 and 3.

3.5. Eﬀect of Matrix Composition

Simulations were also run to test the inﬂuence of the
choice of material for the matrix.
In one set of simu-
lations, the matrix was changed from porous dunite to

ence in the way the peak and bulk values are calculated.
Bulk values are calculated by ﬁnding a weighted average
across the entire same region at a given time. However,
peak quantities are recorded as the maximum value that
each tracer experienced at any time throughout the cal-
culation; thus, resonant oscillations of the shock wave
about the steady state may result in peak values that
exceed the bulk value. This is in good agreement with
behaviour observed in previous mesoscale impact simu-
lations (G¨uldemeister et al. 2013).

the increase in chondrule deformation with impact speed. In these three simulations, the matrix abundance (Ami = 70%), matrix porosity
(φmi = 0.7) and matrix material (dunite) were all kept constant.

a second set of serpentine matrix calculations were run,
with a matrix porosity of 0.6 (instead of 0.7), to match
the bulk density of the matrix in the dunite simulations.
Simulations were run at 1, 2 and 3 km s−1 (Tables 2 and
3).

At 1 km s−1, the pressures and temperatures across all
three simulations are similar (although the higher poros-
ity serpentine simulation has slightly higher pressure and
temperature than the lower porosity run, as expected
from Section 3.4). The serpentine simulations show more
matrix compaction than observed in the dunite simula-
tion. At 2 km s−1, the pressure in the matrix is around
0.5 GPa higher in the φmi = 0.6 serpentine model than
in the dunite model, and around 0.7 GPa lower in the
φmi = 0.7 porosity serpentine model than in the dunite
model. However, in both cases, the temperatures in the
matrix are signiﬁcantly lower than in the dunite simula-
tion (814 K and 941 K in the 60% and 70% serpentine,
compared to 1110 K in the dunite; Figure 13). The same

observation can be made for the 3 km s−1 simulations.
The low serpentine matrix temperature is a consequence
of the phase change of the water content buﬀering the
temperature increase.

4. DISCUSSION

in Macroscale Simulations

4.1. Determination of ε − α Model Parameters For Use
The ε−α porous compaction model (W¨unnemann et al.
2006; Collins et al. 2011) is used to parameterise the
bulk response of porous materials to shock compaction
in impact simulations. The input parameters for this
model are typically constrained by experimental data;
however, they can also be determined using the results
of mesoscale compaction simulations. The ε − α model
was developed as an alternative to the conventional P −α
model (Hermann 1969), because it has the eﬃciency ad-
vantage of computing the distension (α) directly from
the volume strain (ε). As volume strain is usually com-

strain at the transition from the elastic (reversible) to
exponential (irreversible) compaction regimes. For high
porosity materials, εe is small and has a very minor eﬀect
on the compaction curve; hence, in this work εe was set to
a constant −10−5 for all porous mixtures. εx corresponds
to the transition from the exponential to the power-law
compaction regime, and is derived by setting α = αx
in Equation (1). εc is the volume strain at which all
pore space is crushed out (at the transition from power-
law compaction to pure compression). It is derived by
diﬀerentiating Equation (2), and setting dα/dε = 0 to
ensure a smooth termination of compaction. Thus, the
bulk permanent compaction of our mesoscale mixtures
can be characterised by two material speciﬁc parame-
ters (αx and κ). Here we derive estimates for the val-
ues of those two parameters by ﬁtting Hugoniot curves
calculated using the ε-α model to the mesoscale simula-
tion results for a given initial matrix fraction and matrix
porosity over a range of impact velocities.

For the three mixtures which have simulations with ﬁve
or more impact velocities (Ami = 32%, 70% and 81%),
we ﬁnd that αx = 1.06 ﬁts all three well; however the
value of κ is dependent on the bulk porosity. For Ami
= 70% and 80% (i.e. a bulk porosity of 0.49 and 0.57,
respectively), κ = 0.98 ﬁts the simulated data well (this
agrees well with previous simulations of ∼ 50% porous
material; for example W¨unnemann et al. 2008; Davison
et al. 2010). This is shown in Figure 14. For Ami = 32%
(φbi = 0.23), κ = 0.925, a value somewhat lower than
used before.

Using Ami = 32% and Ami = 70% as endpoints, the
value of κ for Ami = 41%, 50% and 62% was estimated
using a linear interpolation (κ = 0.939, 0.953 and 0.966,
respectively), and was found to ﬁt the iSALE data well
(Figure 14). Thus, for future macroscale simulations of
planetesimal collisions, the ε− α model parameter κ can
be determined using the following relationship:

κ = 0.0014Ami + 0.88

For the given matrix porosity used here (φmi = 0.7),

that corresponds to the following relationship:

κ = 0.21φbi + 0.88

4.2. Equilibration Timescale

The temperature dichotomy between the matrix and
chondrules observed in all mesoscale simulations will be
short lived, as the cold chondrules act as heat sinks in-
side the heated matrix. To determine the approximate
timescale of this equilibration, a 1-D ﬁnite diﬀerence
calculation was performed to solve the heat conduction
equation:

puted before the pressure in shock physics models such
as iSALE, this avoids the need for an iteration to ﬁnd
pressure and distension simultaneously. There are four
regimes in the ε−α model to describe the compaction and
compression of a porous material: elastic compaction, ex-
ponential compaction, power-law compaction and com-
pression. Permanent compaction of pore space occurs
in the exponential and power-law compaction regimes,
which are deﬁned, respectively, as:

the boundary was determined by the ﬁnal matrix-to-
chondrule volume ratio (Amf ); for example, if Amf =
40%, the mesh would be composed of 60% chondrule and
40% matrix. The temperature of each component was set
to the mean post-shock temperature for that component
from the iSALE simulation (Tcf and Tmf ; Table 3), and
the porosity of the matrix was assigned the mean post-
shock matrix porosity (φmf ; Table 2). The calculation
was allowed to continue until the standard deviation of
the temperature ﬁeld had decreased below a threshold
value, here taken to be 1% of the bulk temperature.

simulations into a 1D problem here, the calculations
were initialised as follows: The mesh was divided into

Figure 12. The eﬀect of initial matrix porosity (φmi) on the peak pressure, peak temperature and porosity. In these three simulations,
the impact velocity (vi = 2 km s−1), matrix abundance (Ami = 70%) and matrix material (dunite) were all kept constant.
The time taken for these simulations to equilibrate to the
bulk temperature are presented in Table 4. As shown in
Figure 15, the equilibration time is strongly dependent
on the choice of κ0. As we would expect, the time taken
when κ0 = 7 × 10−7 m2 s−1 is a factor of 7 shorter than
the time taken when κ0 = 1 × 10−7 m2 s−1. As the
diﬀusivity in the matrix is also controlled by the poros-
ity, there is a clear dependence of equilibration time on
matrix porosity. For cases where the matrix porosity is
0.1 or less, the equilibration time is on the order of a
less than a second to a few seconds. For higher poros-
ity (φmf = 0.3–0.5), the equilibration time takes 10’s to
100’s of seconds.

An estimate for the length of time a material will re-
main under high pressure for during a shock event is
given by L/Up = 2L/vi (where L is ths impactor di-
ameter, Up is the particle velocity and vi is the impact
velocity; Melosh 1989). For the timescales presented in
Table 4 and Figure 15, this would mean that for impactor
diameters of > 10 km, it is possible that the equilibration

timescale would be shorter than the shock duration (and
thus suggests equilibration may be complete before the
arrival of the release wave). Since most impacts on me-
teorite parent bodies come from impactors smaller than
10 km (Davison et al. 2013), this should not be an im-
portant eﬀect for most impacts. Further modeling to

unequilibrated ordinary chondrites shows that the com-
paction processes presented in this work are able to re-
produce ﬁnal properties consistent with real meteorite
observations (Figure 16(b)).

4.3. Meteorite Groups

Diﬀerent meteorite groups have diﬀerent ranges of bulk
porosities and matrix fractions. For example, carbona-
ceous chondrites have a range of porosities of ∼ 0.04–
0.28 (Macke et al. 2011) and matrix abundances of 30–
70% (Scott & Krot 2003), while ordinary chondrites have
porosities in the range ∼ 0.06–0.16 (Consolmagno et al.
1998) and matrix abundances in the range 10–15% (Scott
& Krot 2003). By choosing simulations with diﬀerent
starting conditions and impact velocities, ﬁnal compo-
sitions can be produced which are similar to those ob-
served in the diﬀerent meteorite groups. Figure 16 shows
the ﬁnal bulk porosities and matrix fractions for a range
of simulations with diﬀerent velocities, for two diﬀerent
starting conditions. The similarity between simulations
that started with Ami = 70% and carbonaceous chon-
drites, and between simulations with Ami = 30% and

4.4. Model Limitations

The simulations described above are a signiﬁcant ﬁrst
step in quantifying the heterogeneous response of pri-
mordial solar system solids to shock compaction. How-
ever, there are several limitations of this approach which
should be addressed in future.

One key limitation is the use of 2D plane-strain ge-
ometry, rather than a more realistic 3D geometry. This
assumption was necessary for this large-parameter-space
study to limit computational cost (both in terms of time
and memory).
In a simulation with 3D geometry, out
of plane contacts between chondrules would likely stiﬀen
the bulk response of the mixture (compared to the plane-
strain geometry), particularly in scenarios where the ini-
tial chondrule volume fraction is high. However, based on

and serpentine) are also over-simpliﬁed. First, the com-
paction model assumes that all of the P dV work de-
posited by the shock in the porous matrix will lead to
a temperature increase. In reality, dissipative processes
during compaction, such as grain deformation and frac-
turing will lead to an increase in entropy as well as
temperature. Neglecting the entropy increase during
crushing will result in an overestimate of shock heat-
ing, but this is diﬃcult to quantify without experimental
measurements of shock heating. Second, the version of
ANEOS that we used to derive the forsterite and serpen-
tine tables does not permit both solid-solid and solid-
liquid phase transitions to be included at the same time
(e.g. Melosh 2007). As in previous work (e.g. Davison
et al. 2010) we regarded the eﬀect of the solid-liquid
phase transition as less important than that of the solid-
solid phase transition. Neglecting latent heat of melting
implies that temperatures in the table that exceed the
solidus are over-estimated.

At higher shock pressures, recent shock compression
experiments of quartz (Hicks et al. 2006) suggest that
ANEOS over estimates the temperature increase and un-
der estimates the entropy increase during shock compres-
sion, because it assumes a heat capacity in the ﬂuid re-
gion that is too low (Kraus et al. 2012). If this limitation
of ANEOS is also important for other silicate rocks, it
implies that the shock pressure required to vaporise the
matrix is over-estimated by ANEOS and that peak and
post-shock temperatures above the liquidus are also over-
estimated. The primary focus of the simulations in this
work was relatively low velocity collisions, which in gen-
eral produced matrix heating below and up to the solidus;
thus, this limitation of ANEOS is of minor signiﬁcance

similar numerical mesoscale studies of pore-space com-

3D geometries were simulated, we expect qualitatively
similar behaviour in both geometries: The magnitude

ity and the trends in the heterogeneity with impact ve-
locity, initial chondrule volume fraction, matrix porosity
and matrix material should all be qualitatively similar.

solid-liquid, Collins & Melosh 2014), which will be im-
portant in those cases.

For the reasons described above, the temperatures
(both peak and post-shock) quoted in Tables 2 and 3, and
particularly those above the solidus, should be considered
as upper limit for each given impact scenario. However,
since the peak and post-shock temperatures are strongly
dependant on the initial matrix porosity and initial tem-
perature, using less conservative initial conditions (e.g.,
higher initial porosity or starting temperature) in our
models could easily compensate for any overestimate in
temperature due to inadequacies of the material model.
Thus, while the exact temperatures in a given simulation
may change with initial conditions or model assumptions,
the relative trends of increasing temperature with impact
velocity, matrix porosity and chondrule volume fraction
are robust.

5. CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we adapted a mesoscale modeling tech-
nique and applied it to meteoritic material. We investi-
gated the eﬀects of impact velocity, composition, matrix
porosity and abundance on the shock processing of me-
teoritic material during an impact. Our results show
that low-speed impact compaction of chondrule-matrix
mixtures can reproduce observed properties of meteoritic
samples. One key observation from our simulations is a
strong temperature dichotomy between the chondrules
(cold) and the matrix (hot) after an impact, even at
relatively low speeds. This temperature dichotomy will
be short lived (seconds to minutes), and the timescale
of equilibration is dependant on the post-shock porosity
of the matrix — since the thermal diﬀusivity decreases
with increasing porosity, more porous materials will stay
hot for longer. In addition to the strong dichotomy in
the temperature between the matrix and the chondrules,
we have observed heterogeneous heating and compaction
within the matrix itself; for example, on the lee side of
chondrules the matrix may be protected from the shock
and thus experience less compaction than the surround-
ing matrix.

In materials with a low matrix abundance (i.e. more
chondrules), as more chondrules come into contact with
each other (at velocities of > 2 km s−1), the matrix can
be protected by the chondrules forming stress bridges, re-
sulting in less compaction than that observed in higher
matrix abundance materials. At low impact velocities
(< 2 km s−1), chondrules typically remain circular. How-
ever, at velocities of 2 km s−1 and above, many chon-
drules are deformed; they become shortened in either the
direction of the shock or due to inter-chondrule collisions.
Using the mesoscale simulation results, we have con-
strained ε − α porous compaction model parameters as
a function of matrix abundance or bulk porosity, which
are appropriate for describing the bulk material response
in macroscale simulations of planetesimal collisions.

where F is the net volume of the tracer’s material ﬂux-
ing into the cell through each face (subscripts L, R, B and
T denote the left, right, bottom and top faces, respec-
tively), α is the volume fraction of the tracer’s material
ﬂuxing through the face compared to the total volume of
material (i.e. Fm/Ftot), Vi,j is the volume of the cell i, j,
and dt is the length of the current time step.

To ensure numerical stability, in cases where the vol-
ume fraction of the tracer’s material is 0 on one face of
the cell, the tracer is assumed to be on the opposite face
and the term for that face in Equations A2 or A3 is ig-
nored; this avoids a divide-by-zero error. For example,
if αL = 0, then sx is assumed to be 1, and the term
(1 − sx)FL/αL is set to 0.
Finally, some checks must be made to ensure that the
velocity calculated here is not going to (a) move the
tracer into a cell that does not contain any of the tracer’s
material, or (b) leave the tracer in a cell that will be-
come empty of the tracer’s material during the timestep.
These two cases are countered by ﬁnding the tracer’s
distance from the cell face, and then moving the tracer
along its current trajectory (determined by the velocity
components in Equations A2 and A3) far enough to just
cross the cell face. For case (a) above, this will return
the tracer to its original cell, and for case (b) it will move
the tracer into the cell where the material is also moving.
As shown in Figure 4, this means that tracers remain
with their material, and do not get isolated from their
material as was possible in the prior cell-node velocity
method. Note that in Figure 4 where some tracers appear
to have crossed the material boundary in the material
method, they are in mixed-material cells (i.e. a cell with
a material boundary in it) and thus are still attached
to their respective material — this is just a result of
how the material boundary contours were drawn while
constructing the ﬁgure.

We note that the problem of tracer drift that we ame-
liorate with the above algorithm is a consequence of ma-
terial being advected through the mesh at a diﬀerent
speed to the bulk ﬂow. This, in turn, is a consequence
of the multi-material advection and interface construc-
tion algorithms in iSALE, which modify material ﬂuxes
between cells to preserve sharp interfaces between ma-
terials. In other words, tracer drift is not necessarily a
limitation of iSALE’s original method for moving tracers
and the optimum tracer movement algorithm for a given
problem will depend on whether it is more important to
track material history or kinematics. The new method
presented here is preferable when a faithful record of ma-

A NEW METHOD FOR MOVING LAGRANGIAN TRACER

PARTICLES

The techniques presented in this work for simulating
the mesoscale eﬀects of shockwaves on meteoritic mate-
rial require the use of Lagrangian tracer particles, which
allow the history of a particular parcel of material to be
tracked as it moves through the ﬁxed (Eulerian) mesh in
iSALE. Here we describe a new method implemented in
iSALE for moving tracer particles.

The original method for displacing a tracer in iSALE
is a simple forward Euler projection of the tracer posi-
tion using the interpolated velocity vector at the tracer
location multiplied by the current timestep duration. Ve-
locity interpolation is bilinear in the x and y directions,
using the velocity stored at the four nodes of the cell
within which the tracer is located at the start of the
timestep.

If ξn

x and ξn

y are the fractional distances across the cell
of the tracer from the four cell nodes (n = 1–4, counter-
clockwise from the bottom left), and vn
y are the
horizontal and vertical components of the velocity at the
node of the cell, then the horizontal and vertical compo-
nents of the tracer’s velocity are calculated as such:

x and vn

(vx, vy) =

(1 − ξn

x )(1 − ξn

y )(vn

x , vn
y )

(A1)

This method works well in simulations with few ma-
terial boundaries, and thus few cells containing multi-
ple materials (typical iSALE simulations involve an im-
pactor into a target with up to three layers, and thus
fewer mixed cells than the simulations presented in this
work). However, as this approach does not respect ma-
terial boundaries it often results in tracers drifting away
from the material they were intended to track through
the simulation (see the top panel of Figure 4). This prob-
lem is more severe in simulations with many material
interfaces and a high proportion of mixed cells. To over-
come this issue, a new method was developed for this
work, in which tracers are moved according to material
ﬂuxes into and out of each face of the cell in which they
are positioned. This information is already calculated
during the advection step of the iSALE cycle and so does
not entail a signiﬁcant computational overhead.

Using the fractional distances from the bottom left
y), the horizontal and vertical

of the cell (i.e. ξ1
velocity components, vx and vy, can be calculated as:
