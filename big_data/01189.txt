Abstract. We give a recursive algorithm for computing the Orlik-Terao algebra of the Coxeter
arrangement of type An−1 as a graded representation of Sn, and we give a conjectural description
of this representation in terms of the cohomology of the conﬁguration space of n points in
SU (2) modulo translation. We also give a version of this conjecture for more general graphical
arrangements.

Introduction

We consider the subalgebra OTn of rational functions on Cn generated by
for all i 6= j. This
is a special case of a class of algebras called Orlik-Terao algebras, which have received much recent
attention [Ter02, PS06, ST09a, Sch11, VLR13, SSV13, DGT14, Le14, Liu, MP15, EPW]. Our
interest is in understanding OTn as a graded representation of the symmetric group Sn, which acts
by permuting the indices.

Let Cn be the cohomology of the conﬁguration space of n labeled points in R3, which is also acted
on by Sn. The ring Cn is related to OTn in two diﬀerent ways. The ﬁrst is that Cn is isomorphic
to the quotient of OTn by the ideal generated by the squares of the generators. This can be seen
explicitly by computing presentations of the two rings, but there is also a much deeper geometric
explanation. Braden and the second author proved that OTn is isomorphic to the equivariant
intersection cohomology of a certain hypertoric variety (Theorem 3.1), and Cn is isomorphic to the
equivariant cohomology of a certain smooth open subset of that hypertoric variety; the map from
OTn to Cn is simply the restriction map in equivariant intersection cohomology. By exploring this
geometric relationship further and considering not only the open subset in question but also other
strata of higher codimension, we obtain a formula which allows us to recursively compute OTn in
terms of Cn (Theorem 3.2). Since the action of Sn on Cn is well understood, this allows us to
compute the action of Sn on OTn for arbitrary n.

Once we do these computations, a diﬀerent and a priori unrelated relationship between OTn
and Cn becomes apparent. Let Rn be the symmetric algebra of the irreducible permutation rep-
resentation of Sn, generated in degree two. The ring OTn is naturally an algebra over Rn, and it

is ﬁnitely generated and free as a graded module. Thus we may deﬁne Mn := OTn ⊗Rn
C, and we
have an Sn-equivariant isomorphism OTn ∼= Rn ⊗C Mn. This reduces the problem of understanding
OTn to the problem of understanding Mn. Let Dn be the cohomology of the conﬁguration space
of n labeled points in SU (2) ∼= S3 modulo the action of SU (2) by simultaneous left translation.
It is easy to show that Cn and Dn are closely related; see Propositions 2.3 and 2.5 for precise
statements. Our computations suggest the following result, which is the main conjecture in this
paper (Conjecture 2.10):

Conjecture. There exists an isomorphism of graded Sn representations Mn ∼= Dn.

Given that we have descriptions of both Mn and Dn in terms of Cn, one would think that this
conjecture would be easy to prove. However, our recursive formula for Mn involves plethysms of
symmetric functions, and while plethysms are ﬁne for computing in SAGE, it is notoriously diﬃcult
to use them to prove anything.

Our paper is structured roughly in the reverse of the order in which it was presented above. We
begin in Section 2 by giving a detailed account of our main conjecture, without any discussion of
how to compute OTn and Mn. We also generalize our conjecture to arbitrary graphs. In Section 3,
we explain how to use the equivariant intersection cohomology of hypertoric varieties to compute
OTn. Our main result in this section is Theorem 3.2, but we also we also do some extra work to
translate our recursive formula to the language of symmetric functions (Proposition 3.6), since this
is the most convenient formulation for actually computing with SAGE.

with the assistance of the computer algebra systems SAGE [S+15], GAP [GAP15], and Macaulay
2 [GS].

2 Conjectures

We begin by introducing the main players in our paper: the Orlik-Terao algebra OTn and its ﬁnite
dimensional quotient Mn (Section 2.1), the cohomology rings Cn and Dn of two closely related
conﬁguration spaces (Section 2.2), and our main conjecture relating them (Section 2.3). We also
generalize our conjecture to arbitrary graphs (Section 2.4).

2.1 The Orlik-Terao algebra

Fix a positive integer n, and let OTn be the subalgebra of rational functions on Cn generated by
the elements eij := 1
for all i 6= j. This algebra is known as the Orlik-Terao algebra of the
Coxeter arrangement of type An−1. It follows from [PS06, Theorem 4] and [ST09b, Proposition
2.7] that the ideal of relations between these generators is generated by eij + eji for all i, j and

xi−xj

2

eijejk +ejkeki+ekieij for all distinct triples i, j, k. We regard OTn as a graded ring with deg(eij) = 2.
Our goal is to understand OTn as a graded representation of the symmetric group Sn, which acts
by permuting the indices.

Let Rn := C[z1, . . . , zn]/hz1 + · · · + zni, with its natural Sn action, and graded by putting
deg(zi) = 2. Consider the Sn-equivariant graded algebra homomorphism ϕn : Rn → OTn taking zi

toPj6=i eij. This gives OTn the structure of a graded module over Rn, and it is in fact a free module

by [PS06, Proposition 7]. In other words, if we deﬁne Mn := OTn ⊗Rn
by setting ϕn(zi) equal to zero for all i, then there exists an isomorphism of graded Rn-modules

C to be the ring obtained

OTn ∼= Rn ⊗C Mn.

This isomorphism is not canonical, and is not compatible with the ring structures on the two sides.
However, it is compatible with the action of Sn on both sides. Thus, we may reduce the problem
of understanding OTn as a graded representation to the problem of understanding Mn.

Remark 2.1. It is easy to describe Mn as a graded vector space. For any ﬁnite dimensional

graded vector space V concentrated in even degree, let H(V, q) := P qi dim V2i, where V2i is the

degree 2i part of V . Then H(Mn, q) is equal to the h-polynomial of the broken circuit complex
associated with the Coxeter arrangement of type An−1 [PS06, Proposition 7], which is equal to
(1 + q)(1 + 2q) · · · (1 + (n − 2)q).

The following proposition was proved by the ﬁrst author [Mos12, Theorem 3.10]; it may also

be deduced from [CEF15, Theorem 3.3.3].

Proposition 2.2. The sequence {Mn} of graded representations of symmetric groups is represen-
tation stable.

2.2 Two conﬁguration spaces

Consider the conﬁguration space Conf(n, R3) be the conﬁguration space of n labeled points in R3,
which admits an action of Sn given by permuting the labels. Let

Cn := H ∗(Conf(n, R3); C),

which is a graded representation of Sn. The ring Cn has a presentation closely related to that of
OTn; it is isomorphic to the quotient of OTn by the ideal generated by e2
ij for all i, j [CLM76,
Chapter III, Lemma 7.7]. This algebra is also known as the Artinian Orlik-Terao algebra of
the Coxeter arrangement of type An−1. The structure of Cn as a graded representation of Sn is
complicated but well understood; see Equation (1).

Next, let G = SU (2) ∼= S3, and consider the conﬁguration space Conf(n, G)/G of n labeled
points in G up to simultaneous translation by left multiplication. This space admits an action of
Sn by permuting the labels; let

Dn := H ∗(Conf(n, G)/G; C),

3

which is a graded representation of Sn.

Proposition 2.3. There exists an isomorphism

Cn−1 ∼= ResSn

Sn−1

(Dn)

of graded representations of Sn−1.

Proof. We have a diﬀeomorphism Conf(n, G)/G ∼= Conf(n − 1, R3) given by using the action of
G to take the nth point to the identity, leaving the remaining n points in G r {id} ∼= R3. This
diﬀeomorphism is equivariant with respect to the action of Sn−1 ⊂ Sn.

Remark 2.4. The polynomial H(Dn, q) = H(Cn−1, q) is equal to the f -polynomial of the broken
circuit complex associated with the Coxeter arrangement of type An−2 [OT94, Theorem 4.3], which
is equal to (1 + q)(1 + 2q) · · · (1 + (n − 2)q).

Let Wn := Rn/hzizji be the ring obtained by truncating Rn to degree two. As a graded
representation of Sn, Wn is isomorphic to the 1-dimensional trivial representation in degree zero
plus the irreducible permutation representation of dimension n − 1 in degree two.

Proposition 2.5. There exists an isomorphism

Cn ∼= Dn ⊗C Wn

of graded representations of Sn.

Proof. Consider the projection Conf(n + 1, G)/G → Conf(n, G)/G given by forgetting the (n + 1)st
point. This is an Sn-equivariant ﬁber bundle with ﬁber diﬀeomorphic to the complement of n
points in G. The base is simply connected and both the base and the ﬁber have cohomology only
in even degree, thus the Leray-Serre spectral sequence degenerates and the cohomology of the total
space is isomorphic to the tensor product of the cohomology of the base and the cohomology of the
ﬁber. This yields the desired isomorphism.

Remark 2.6. Proposition 2.3 tells us that, if we know how to compute Dn+1, we know how to
compute Cn. Conversely, since Wn is not a zero divisor in the semiring of graded representations
of Sn, Proposition 2.5 tells us that we can recover Dn from Cn. This is important because there
exist extremely explicit formulas for Cn in the literature; see Equation (1).

Corollary 2.7. The sequence {Dn} of graded representations of symmetric groups is representation
stable.

Proof. Representation stability of {Cn} (or, more generally, for the cohomology of the conﬁguration
space of any manifold) was proved by Church [Chu12, Theorem 1]. For {Wn}, it is obvious.
Representation stability of {Dn} then follows from Proposition 2.5.

4

Given a graded representation V of Sn, let V be the ungraded representation obtained by
forgetting the grading. In this section, we describe C n and Dn. Let Zn ⊂ Sn be the cyclic group.

Proposition 2.8. There exist isomorphisms

C n ∼= C[Sn]

and

Dn ∼= C[Sn/Zn] ∼= IndSn
Zn

(triv)

of representations of Sn.

Proof. The ﬁrst isomorphism is well-known, but we quickly review one proof here because we will
use a very similar argument for the second isomorphism. Consider the action of U (1) on R3 ∼= R⊕ C
given by rotation on the second factor, which induces an action of U (1) on Conf(n, R3). Since
H ∗(Conf(n, R3); C) is concentrated in even degree, this action is equivariantly formal, meaning that
the U (1)-equivariant cohomology of Conf(n, R3) is a free module over the equivariant cohomology
of a point. It follows that there is a natural ﬁltration on the cohomology of the ﬁxed point set
Conf(n, R3)U (1) whose associated graded is isomorphic to the cohomology of Conf(n, R3) [Mos,
Corollary 2.6]. Since the action of U (1) commutes with the action of Sn, this isomorphism is
Sn-equivariant [Mos, Proposition 2.8]. We have

Conf(n, R3)U (1) ∼= Conf(n, R) ≃ Sn,

so

H ∗(cid:16)Conf(n, R3)U (1); C(cid:17) ∼= C[Sn].

Passing to the associated graded does not change the isomorphism type of an (ungraded) represen-
tation of a ﬁnite group, thus C n ∼= C[Sn].

For the second isomorphism, we note that U (1) acts on Conf(n, G)/G by right translation,

commuting with the action of Sn, with ﬁxed point set

(Conf(n, G)/G)U (1) ∼= Conf(n, U (1))/U (1) ≃ Sn/Zn.

The second isomorphism follows by the same argument.

Remark 2.9. The ﬁltration of H ∗(Conf(n, R)) ∼= C[Sn] whose associated graded is isomorphic to
Cn can be described very explicitly. First, note that Conf(n, R) is a disjoint union of contractible
pieces, so its cohomology ring is simply the ring of locally constant functions. A Heaviside
function hij is a function that takes the value 1 on one side of a given hyperplane {xi = xj} and 0
on the other side. We deﬁne the pth ﬁltered piece Fp C[Sn] to be the vector space of functions that
can be expressed as polynomials of degree at most p in the Heaviside functions. This ﬁltration,
was ﬁrst studied by Varchenko and Gelfand [?], coincides with the one arising from equivariant
cohomology [Mos, Remark 4.9].

Similarly, we may deﬁne a cyclic Heaviside function hijk on Conf(n, U (1))/U (1) by specifying
a cyclic ordering of the ith, jth and kth points. This is equal to the pullback of hij from Conf(n−1, R)

5

along the isomorphism from Conf(n, U (1))/U (1) to Conf(n−1, R) given by using the action of U (1)
to move the kth point to the origin. Since we know that the ﬁltration of H ∗(Conf(n − 1, R); C)
arising from equivariant cohomology coincides with the one induced by Heaviside functions, we
may conclude that, for any ﬁxed index k, the ﬁltration of H ∗(Conf(n, U (1))/U (1); C) arising from
equivariant cohomology coincides with the ﬁltration generated by the cyclic Heaviside functions
{hijk | 0 ≤ i < j ≤ n}. Since the ﬁltration arising from equivariant cohomology is preserved by the
action of Sn, it must also coincide with the ﬁltration generated by all cyclic Heaviside functions,
where all three indices are allowed to vary.

2.3 The main conjecture

Our main conjecture is as follows.

Conjecture 2.10. There exists an isomorphism of graded Sn representations Mn ∼= Dn.

Remark 2.11. Using the computational technique described in Section 3 (speciﬁcally Proposition
3.6), we have checked Conjecture 2.10 on a computer up to n = 10.

Remark 2.12. Remarks 2.1 and 2.4 tell us that Conjecture 2.10 holds at the level of graded vector
spaces.

Remark 2.13. Since Wn is not a zero divisor in the semiring of graded representations of Sn,
Conjecture 2.10 is equivalent to the statement that Mn ⊗CWn ∼= Dn⊗CWn. Since OTn ∼= Rn ⊗CMn,
we have

Mn ⊗C Wn ∼= OTn/hzizji.

On the other hand, Proposition 2.5 says that

Dn ⊗C Wn ∼= Cn ∼= OTn/he2

ij i.

We know that C{zizj} and C{e2
ij} are both isomorphic to the symmetric square of the irreducible
permutation representation, thus Conjecture 2.10 holds in degrees zero, two, and four for all values
of n.

Remark 2.14. Since zizj = −e2
natural to consider the family of rings

ij + fij, where fij is a certain sum of square-free monomials, it is

An(t) := OTn/h(1 − t)e2

ij − tzizji = OTn/he2

ij − tfiji,

where t ∈ C. By Remark 2.13, An(0) ∼= Dn ⊗C Wn and An(1) ∼= Mn ⊗C Wn. There exists a
nonempty Zariski open subset U ⊂ C such that the restriction of this family to U is ﬂat, which
means that the graded Sn representations An(t) are isomorphic for all t ∈ U . If 0, 1 ∈ U , this would
imply Conjecture 2.10. Unfortunately, this is not the case. For example, when n = 4, computations
in Macaulay 2 reveal that U = C r {0, 1, − 1

2 }.

6

Put diﬀerently, this means that most ideals in OT4 that are generated by a copy of the symmetric
square of the permutation representation in degree four are strictly larger than both he2
ij i and hzizji.
These two ideals are exceptional, and our conjecture (which is true when n = 4) says that they are
exceptional in the same way.

2.4 Generalizing to graphs

In this section we generalize some of our results and conjectures to graphs; the cases described
above correspond to the complete graph.

Let Γ be a simple connected graph with vertex set [n], and let Aut(Γ) ⊂ Sn be the group of
automorphisms of Γ. Let OTΓ be the Orlik-Terao algebra of the hyperplane arrangement associated
with Γ; this is the subalgebra of rational functions on Cn generated by
whenever i and j are
connected by an edge. It is a graded representation of the automorphism group Aut(Γ) ⊂ Sn, with
the generators in degree two. We again have a map from Rn to OTΓ as before, and we let

xi−xj

1

Then there exists a graded Aut(Γ)-equivariant isomorphism

MΓ := OTΓ ⊗Rn

C.

OTΓ ∼= Rn ⊗C MΓ,

and H(MΓ, q) = hΓ(q), the h-polynomial of the corresponding broken circuit complex [PS06, Propo-
sition 7].

For any space X, consider the space Conf(Γ, X) of maps from the vertices of Γ to X such that

adjacent vertices map to diﬀerent points. Let

CΓ := H ∗(Conf(Γ, R3)

and

DΓ := H ∗(Conf(Γ, G)/G; C),

both graded representations of Aut(Γ). Let ˆΓ be the cone over Γ; this is the graph with vertex set
[n + 1] such that the (n + 1)st vertex is connected to all other vertices and the subgraph spanned by
the remaining vertices is equal to Γ. The following proposition is a straightforward generalization
of Proposition 2.3.

Proposition 2.15. There exists an isomorphism

of graded representations of Aut(Γ).

CΓ ∼= ResAut(ˆΓ)

Aut(Γ)(cid:0)DˆΓ(cid:1)

The following conjecture is a natural generalization of Conjecture 2.10.

Conjecture 2.16. For any simple connected graph Γ, there exists an isomorphism

MΓ ∼= DΓ

7

of graded representations of Aut(Γ). In particular, there exists an isomorphism

Remark 2.17. We have H(MˆΓ, q) = hˆΓ(q) = fΓ(q) = H(CΓ, q), thus the second part of Conjecture
2.16 holds at the level of graded vector spaces.

ResAut(ˆΓ)

Aut(Γ)(cid:0)MˆΓ(cid:1) ∼= CΓ.

3 Computing Mn via hypertoric geometry

In this section, we explain how to use the geometry of hypertoric varieties to compute Mn.

3.1 Hypertoric varieties

Given any hyperplane arrangement A deﬁned over the rational numbers, one may deﬁne a variety
called a hypertoric variety. Rather than giving a general construction, we will instead give a
direct deﬁnition of the hypertoric variety Xn associated with the (doubled) Coxeter arrangement
of type An−1. For a general deﬁnition, see [Pro08].

Let Kn be the lattice of rank n(n − 1) with basis {yij | i 6= j ∈ [n]}. Consider the map
π : Kn → Z{x1, . . . , xn} taking yij to xi − xj, and let Ln be the image of π. Consider the
polynomial ring in 2n(n − 1) variables

Qn := C[zij, wij]i6=j.

This ring has a grading by K ∗
ij = − deg(wij). Let QL
the subring of Qn spanned by homogeneous elements whose degree lies in the sublattice L∗
Consider the map

n deﬁned by putting deg(zij) = y∗

n denote
n ⊂ K ∗.

taking yij to zijwij, and deﬁne

µn : Sym K C

n → QL
n

Pn := QL

n /hµn(y) | π(y) = 0i

and

Xn := Spec Pn.

The variety Xn is the hypertoric variety that will be the main object of our attention. Let

Tn := Hom(L∗

n, C×)

be the algebraic torus of dimension n − 1 with character lattice L∗
n induces
an action of Tn on Xn. We also have an action of the symmetric group Sn on Xn given by permuting
indices. This action does not commute with the action of Tn, but rather deﬁnes an action of the
semidirect product Tn ⋊ Sn on Xn, where Sn acts on Tn in the obvious way. The variety Xn and
its various symmetries are important to us due to the following theorem [BP09, Corollary 4.5] (see
also [MP15, Proposition 3.16]).

n; the grading of Pn by L∗

8

Theorem 3.1. There exists a canonical isomorphism

IH ∗

Tn(Xn; C) ∼= OTn

between the Tn-equivariant intersection cohomology of Xn and OTn. This isomorphism is compatible
with the maps from

H ∗

Tn(∗; C) ∼= Sym(L∗

n)C ∼= Rn.

In particular, this implies that

IH ∗(Xn; C) ∼= Mn.

Furthermore, all of these isomorphisms are compatible with the natural actions of the symmetric
group Sn.

We next deﬁne a stratiﬁcation of Xn, following the general construction in [PW07, Section 2].

For each partition B1 ⊔ · · · ⊔ Bℓ of the set [n], consider the ideal

J B
n := hzij, wij | there exists an r such that i, j ∈ Bri ⊂ Qn.

This ideal descends to an ideal in Pn, which cuts out a subvariety X B
if and only if B reﬁnes B′, and we deﬁne

n ⊂ Xn. We have X B ′

n ⊂ X B
n

Then

˚X B

n := X B

is a Tn-equivariant stratiﬁcation of Xn. For each partition B, consider the subtorus

T B
n := T|B1| × · · · × T|Bℓ| ⊂ Tn,

embedded in the natural way. Then T B
n acts freely on ˚X B
thus the torus Tn/T B
quotient of ˚X B
to Conf(ℓ, R3) [PW07, Proposition 5.2]. Finally, the stratum ˚X B
equivariantly isomorphic to X|B1| × · · · × X|Bℓ| [PW07, Lemma 2.4].

n is the stabilizer of every point in ˚X B
n [PW07, Remark 2.3],
n . The quotient space is not Hausdorﬀ, but if we take the
n , we obtain a manifold homeomorphic
n has a normal slice that is T B
n -

n by the maximal compact subtorus of Tn/T B

3.2 A geometric recursion

Given any partition B of [n], let SB be the stabilizer of B. Letting mi be the number of parts of
B of size i, we may express SB as a product of wreath products:

Si ≀ Smi.

SB

∼=

Yi=1

9

Given any partition λ of n, let B(λ) be the partition of [n] given by putting B1 = {1, . . . , λ1},
B2 = {λ1 + 1, . . . , λ1 + λ2}, and so on. Let Sλ := SB(λ) ⊂ Sn be the stabilizer of the partition B(λ),

and let Wλ :=Q Smi ⊂ Sλ.

We deﬁne a graded representation M c

n)i := (Mn)4(n−1)−i. Theorem 3.1
says that Mn ∼= IH ∗(Xn; C), and 4(n − 1) = 2 dimC Xn = dimR Xn, thus we have M c
c (Xn; C)
by Poincar´e duality. We will use the geometry of the hypertoric variety Xn to prove the following
result.

n of Sn by putting (M c

∼= IH ∗

Theorem 3.2. For any positive integer n, there exists an isomorphism of graded Sn representations

λ1 ⊗ Rλ1) ⊗ · · · ⊗ (M c

λℓ(λ)

⊗ Rλℓ(λ))(cid:17) .

Here the subgroup Wλ ⊂ Sλ acts on Cℓ(λ) via the embedding Wλ ֒→ SP mi = Sℓ(λ), and it also
permutes the remaining tensor factors of the same size.
In addition, each factor of the form
M c
λj

⊗ Rλj is acted on by a separate subgroup Sλj ⊂ Sλ.

Remark 3.3. We claim that Theorem 3.2 provides a recursive means of computing Mn for all
n ≥ 2. To see this, we ﬁrst observe that, since OTn ∼= Rn ⊗C Mn, it is possible to recover Mn from
OTn. Moreover, since Mn vanishes in degrees greater than 2(n − 2), it is possible to recover Mn
from the truncation of OTn to degree 2(n − 2). If we try to use Theorem 3.2 to compute OTn and
Mn in terms of Mk for k < n, we run into the problem that M c
n appears on the right-hand side of
the isomorphism. However, M c
n vanishes in degrees less than 4(n − 1) − 2(n − 2) = 2n, therefore
we can compute the truncation of OTn to degree 2(n − 2) without knowing Mn, and we avoid any
circularity.

Remark 3.4. Theorem 3.2 can be generalized to a recursive expression for OTA in terms M c
A′ for
various restrictions A′ of A and CA′′ for various localizations A′′ of A. Taking A to be a graphical
Γ′ for various contractions Γ′ of Γ
arrangement, this means we may compute OTΓ in terms of M c
and CΓ′′ for various subgraphs Γ′′ of Γ.

Let ICXn be the Tn-equivariant intersection cohomology sheaf on Xn. For each partition B =
n ֒→ Xn be the inclusion. To prove Theorem 3.2, we ﬁrst establish

B1 ⊔ · · · ⊔ Bℓ of [n], let ιB : ˚X B
the following lemma.

Lemma 3.5. There exists an SB-equivariant isomorphism of graded vector spaces

Proof. The cohomology of the complex ι!

Since the category of graded representations of Sn is semisimple, we have a (noncanonical) Sn-
Tn(Xn; C) ∼= E∞. The result now follows from
equivariant isomorphism of graded vector spaces IH ∗
Theorem 3.1.

3.3 Symmetric functions

In order to implement the recursive formula in Theorem 3.2 in SAGE, it is convenient to convert
everything to the language of symmetric functions. Let Λ be the ring of symmetric functions in
inﬁnitely many variables with coeﬃcients in the formal power series ring Z[[q]]. If V is a graded
representation of Sn, concentrated in even degree, with ﬁnite dimensional graded parts, then its

11

graded Frobenius characteristic ch V is an element of Λ of symmetric degree n; the coeﬃcient
of qi is equal to the usual Frobenius characteristic of V2i. The Frobenius characteristic map is an
isomorphism of vector spaces, thus it is suﬃcient to compute ch OTn and ch Mn for each n. More
concretely, expressing Mn as an N[q]-linear combination of irreducible representations is equivalent
to expressing ch Mn as an N[q]-linear combination of Schur functions.

We begin by analyzing a single summand from Theorem 3.2. The ﬁrst piece that we need to
understand better is Cℓ(λ), which is acted on by the subgroup Wλ ⊂ Sλ. We want to decompose
Cℓ(λ) into irreducible representations for this subgroup:

Cℓ(λ)

∼= M(ν1,...,νn)

νi⊢mi

Vν1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ Vνn ⊗ U (ν1, . . . , νn),

where

U (ν1, . . . , νn)

:= HomWλ(cid:0)Vν1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ Vνn, Cℓ(λ)(cid:1)
∼= HomSn(cid:16)IndSn

(Vν1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ Vνn) , Cℓ(λ)(cid:17)

Wλ

is the graded vector space that records the graded multiplicity of Vν1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ Vνn in Cℓ(λ).

Let Yλ denote the Young subgroup Qn

up our induction into two steps, ﬁrst from Sλ to Yλ and then from Yλ to Sn. We have

i=1 Simi, so that we have Sλ ⊂ Yλ ⊂ Sn. We will break

The graded Frobenius characteristic map has the following properties [Mac95, Sections I.7-8]:

• ch Vν = sν (irreducibles go to Schur functions)

• if Sn y V and Sn y V ′, then ch(V ⊕ V ′) = ch V + ch V ′

• if Sn y V and Sn y V ′, then ch(V ⊗ V ′) = ch V ∗ ch V ′ (internal or “Kroneker” product)

• if Sn y V and Sn y V ′, then H(HomSn (V, V ′) , q) = hch V, ch V ′i (inner product)

• if Si y V and Sj y V ′, then ch IndSi+j
Si×Sj

(V ⊗ V ′) = ch V · ch V ′ (ordinary product)

• if Si y V and Sj y V ′, then ch Ind

Sij

Si≀Sj(cid:0)V ′ ⊗ V ⊗j(cid:1) = ch V ′[ch V ] (plethysm).

The analysis that we have done in this section, combined with Theorem 3.2, gives us the following
result.

12

Proposition 3.6. We have

ch OTn = X(ν1,...,νn)

P i|νi|=n

Dsν1 · · · sνn, ch CP |νi|E

n

Yi=1

sνi[ch M c

i ∗ ch Ri].

Recall that M c

i is just Mi “backward”, so ch M c

i is obtained from ch Mi by replacing q with q−1
and multiplying by q2(i−1). Thus, in order to use Proposition 3.6 to compute ch OTn and ch Mn
recursively, it remains only to ﬁnd explicit formulas for ch Cn and ch Rn. A formula for Cn is
given by Hersh and Reiner [HR, Theorem 2.7], based on the work of Sundaram and Welker [SW97,
Theorem 4.4(iii)]. Let ζn be an irreducible 1-dimensional representation of the cyclic group Zn ⊂ Sn
whose character takes a generator of Zn to a primitive nth root of unity, and let ℓn := ch IndSn
(ζn).
Zn
Let hn denote the complete homogeneous symmetric function of degree n. Then

ch Cn =Xλ⊢n

qP(i−1)mi

hmi[ℓi].

The description of ch Rn can be found in [Pro03, Section 5.6]:

ch Rn = (1 − q)Xλ⊢n

sλ(1, q, q2, . . .)sλ.
