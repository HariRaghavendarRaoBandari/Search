It has been generally accepted that unﬁlled skutterudites process high lattice thermal conductivity
(κl) that can be eﬃciently reduced upon ﬁlling. Here by using ﬁrst principles Boltzmann-Peierls
transport calculations, we ﬁnd pure skutterudite of FeSb3 with no ﬁller in fact has an intrinsic
ultralow κl smaller than that of CoSb3 by one order of magnitude. The value is even smaller than
those of most of the fully ﬁlled skutterudites. This ﬁnding means that with FeSb3 as a reference,
ﬁlling does not necessarily lower κl. The ultralow κl of FeSb3 is a consequence of much softened
optical phonon branches associated with the weakly bonded Sb4 rings. They overlap more with heat-
carrying acoustic phonons and signiﬁcantly increase the phase space for three-phonon anharmonic
scattering processes. This provides an alternative non-ﬁlling related mechanism for lowering the κl
of skutterudites.

Skutterudites are an important class of high perfor-
mance thermoelectrics [1–20] as the embodiment of the
Slack’s “electron-crystal phonon-glass” idea [21]. The ex-
istence of two isosahedron voids in their crystal structures
allows for ﬁlling in a variety of cations (e.g., rare earth,
alkali earth or alkali metals). This oﬀers dual advantages
for good thermoelectrics: ﬁrst, according to the Zintl con-
cept the additional electrons transferred from the elec-
tropositive ﬁllers to the CoSb3 framework make possi-
ble ﬂexible control of n-type doping [4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 15–
17, 22, 23], and provides compensating change to the
p-type doping with Co replaced by electron deﬁcient Fe
[1, 2, 5, 8, 14, 24]. Second, and more importantly, ﬁll-
ing strongly lowers lattice thermal conductivity (κl) [1–
4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 15, 17–19, 22] and optimizing the ﬁlling
to lower κl both in terms of ﬁlling fraction and by using
suitable mixtures of ﬁlled cations plays a central role in
the optimization of high performance skutterudite ther-
moelectrics [4].

The physical mechanism responsible for the reduction
in ﬁlled skutterudites remains elusive after two
of κl
decades of intensive research. There are several debated
aspects about the nature and role of the vibrations as-
sociated with the ﬁlled “rattling” atoms:
(i) whether
the motion of the rattling atoms is incoherent and non-
correlated [21, 25–27] or coherently couples with the
host framework [28, 29]; (ii) whether there exists anhar-
monic interaction between the localized rattling modes
and the propagating phonons of the host framework [30–
34]; (iii) whether the reduction of κl originates from
the energy dissipation caused by the resonant scatter-
ing of the rattling atoms [2, 21, 25, 35] or the enhanced
conventional anharmonic (Umklapp) scattering processes
[29, 33, 34, 36].

Despite controversy over the mechanism, there is con-
sensus that the ﬁlling should reduce the κl of skutteru-
dites. In this Letter we report the ﬁnding via ﬁrst prin-

ciples transport calculations that the recently reported
skutterudite FeSb3 [37–42] often presumed to be closely
related to CoSb3 in fact has an very low κl without ﬁlling,
even lower than those of most of the fully ﬁlled skutteru-
dites (e.g., with Ba, La and Ce). This ultralow κl in an
unﬁlled skutterudite is a consequence of the much soft-
ened optical phonon branches that take the role of the
rattling modes in the ﬁlled skutterudites. The emerged
low-lying optical phonons overlap more with the heat-
carrying acoustic phonons and increase three-phonon an-
harmonic scattering channels, thus signiﬁcantly reducing
phonon lifetimes and κl. This ﬁnding demonstrates an
unexpected mechanism for the reduction of κl in skut-
terudites.

We perform ﬁrst principles calculations of κl for FeSb3
and fully ﬁlled skutterudites of La/CeFe4Sb12 by iter-
atively solving the linearized Boltzmann-Peierls trans-
port equation of phonons with the SHENGBTE pack-
age [43] (see Supplementary methods for more details).
The equilibrium crystal structures and interatomic force
constants (IFCs) are obtained from DFT calculations
with the plane-wave projector-augmented-wave method
[44], as implemented in the VASP code [45]. We em-
ploy the local density approximation (LDA) as exchange-
correlation functional. A ferromagnetic conﬁguration for
FeSb3 is used, which is the lowest-energy magnetic con-
ﬁguration at the LDA level. Structural optimization is
done with the kinetic energy cutoﬀs of 350 eV or more
and the 8×8×8 k-point mesh, which ensures the residual
forces smaller than 1x10−4 eV/˚A. The resulted equilib-
rium lattice constants are slightly smaller than the ex-
perimental data (by 2.03%, 1.78%, and 2.00% for FeSb3,
LaFe4Sb12 and CeFe4Sb12, respectively) as in Supple-
mentary Table S1. The agreements are reasonably good
by consideration of the usual underestimation of lattice
constants in the DFT-LDA calculations. The harmonic
and third-order anharmonic IFCs are calculated by using

the real-space supercell approach [43, 46], in a 3×3×3
supercell with a 2×2×2 k-point mesh and a 2×2×2 su-
percell with a 3×3×3 k-point mesh, respectively. The
phonon momenta q-mesh of 15×15×15 is used in solv-
ing the transport equation to ensure κl converged at the
1×10−6 W/mK level.

Fig. 1 shows calculated κl as the function of temper-
ature for unﬁlled FeSb3 and CoSb3 [47], as well as fully
ﬁlled skutterudites of LaFe4Sb12, CeFe4Sb12, YbFe4Sb12
[34], BaFe4Sb12 [34] and BaCo3Sb12 [33]. The excel-
lent agreement between theoretical results of CoSb3 and
available experimental data [12, 48] strongly indicate the
validity of our calculations. Surprisingly, we ﬁnd that
FeSb3 exhibits a quite low κl of 1.14 W/mK at 300 K,
about one order of magnitude lower than 11.6 W/mK of
CoSb3. In the whole temperature range the κl of FeSb3
is apparently much lower than the values of the most
ﬁlled skutterudites (by more than two-third). The only
exception is YbFe4Sb12 that owes the lowest theoretical
κl among reported ﬁlled skutterudites [34].

room-temperature heat capacity and the averaged group
velocity over the long-wavelength acoustic phonons con-
tributing predominately to heat-carrying, respectively.
The diﬀerence in the heat capacities of FeSb3 and CoSb3
is negligibly small (less than 0.7%) and their values are
∼7% lower than those of La/YbFe4Sb12. This is almost
exactly as expected from the Dulong-Petit law, in accord
with experiments (see Supplementary Fig. S1). The
square of averaged phonon velocity for FeSb3 is about
17% and 10% lower than that of CoSb3 and LaFe4Sb12,
respectively. This originates from the substantially re-
duced frequencies and velocities of the acoustic phonons
in FeSb3 (see below). However, the inﬂuences of these
two factors are far from enough to explain the above large
discrepancies in κl. Therefore it must be the phonon life-
time that plays a central role in reducing κl of FeSb3.

FIG. 2.
(color online) Analysis of key factors that may
aﬀect κl for FeSb3, CoSb3 and the ﬁlled skutterudites of
La/YbFe4Sb12: (a) heat capacity, (b) phonon velocity, (c)
interatomic force constant and (d) scattering phase space. In
(b) the phonon velocity is calculated by averaging the group
velocities of the long-wavelength (both transverse and longi-
tudinal) acoustic phonons along diﬀerent phonon momentum
directions. In (c) the notation of M nth represents that the
nth-order IFCs of the compound M is used to replace the
original IFCs when calculating the room-temperature κl.

The intrinsic phonon lifetimes of crystalline materi-
als are primarily dominated by the three-phonon anhar-
monic scattering processes. Fig. 3 shows the calculated
anharmonic scattering rates at 300 K. As seen, the scat-
tering rates of FeSb3 are nearly one order of magnitude
larger than those of CoSb3 in the low and intermedi-
ate frequency (ω) regions (below 5 THz). Clearly at

most of ω the rates of FeSb3 are much higher than those
of LaFe4Sb12, though lower than those of YbFe4Sb12.
Therefore the observed diﬀerences in the anharmonic
scattering processes that limit phonon lifetimes indeed
account for the discrepancies in κl. Note that the anhar-
monic scattering rates of FeSb3 are remarkably enhanced
in a wide intermediate frequency range between ∼1 and
5 THz. The behavior is similar to those in La/YbFe4Sb12
and other ﬁlled skutterudites [33, 34]. This aﬀects con-
tributions of phonon modes to κl, as indicated by the
cumulative plot of κl (κc
l ) that represents the fraction of
heat carried by the phonons with less frequencies than
ω (inset of Fig. 3). The higher anharmonic scattering
rates correspond to the smaller lifetimes, and thus the
less contributions of the phonons to κl. While for CoSb3
κc
l increase rapidly with ω and the phonons below 2 THz
have already contributed to ∼80% of κl, κc
l of FeSb3 show
a much slower increase and the phonons below 2 THz
only contribute to ∼50% of κl. The behavior of κc
l of
FeSb3 resembles those of ﬁlled skutterudites, especially
YbFe4Sb12.

inset.

We further investigate the roles of harmonic and third-
order anharmonic IFCs in enhancing three-phonon an-
harmonic scattering processes and reducing κl in FeSb3.
In particular we perform calculations of κl by deliberately
interchanging the harmonic/anharmonic IFCs between
two diﬀerent compounds, as shown in Fig. 2c. For FeSb3,
when replacing the anharmonic IFCs by the ones from

3

CoSb3 and remaining the other quantities unchanged, we
ﬁnd that κl increases by ∼30%, whereas κl of CoSb3 de-
creases by ∼30% when using the anharmonic IFCs from
FeSb3. The anharmonic scattering rates are generally
proportional to the square of the anharmonic IFCs (Eq.
S3 and S4). The result means the anharmonic IFCs of
FeSb3 are larger than those of CoSb3, corresponding to
the higher scattering rates in FeSb3, but far from enough
to account for its one-order lower κl. For the ﬁlled skut-
terudites of LaFe4Sb12 and YbFe4Sb12, when using the
anharmonic IFCs from FeSb3, the resulted κl show ∼50%
and ∼130% increases, respectively. This indicates the an-
harmonic IFCs of FeSb3 are smaller, corresponding to the
lower scattering rates, which conﬂicts with the smaller κl
of FeSb3 than that of LaFe4Sb12. When we interchange
the harmonic IFCs between FeSb3 and CoSb3, we ﬁnd κl
of FeSb3 increases by about 8 times, and κl of CoSb3 de-
creases by almost the same amount. The changes accord
well with the discrepancy of κl between FeSb3 and CoSb3.
From these results, we can conclude that the main factor
responsible for the enhanced anharmonic scattering in
FeSb3 is the harmonic IFCs, rather than the third-order
anharmonic IFCs.

anharmonic scattering processes is through phonon fre-
quencies and eigenvectors (Eq. S3 and S4). The phonon
eigenvectors contribute to the three-phonon scattering
matrix elements. Usually for the same class of materi-
als, the changes of eigenvectors with the varied harmonic
IFCs are not as large as the changes of frequencies. It
is thus reasonably to assume the scattering matrix ele-
ments do not change substantially here. The action of
phonon frequencies on the anharmonic scattering is em-
bodied by the three-phonon scattering phase space W±
(see Eq. S5), which depicts available three-phonon scat-
tering channels among all modes. It consists of two com-
ponents corresponding to absorption (W+, two phonons
merging into one) and emission (W−, one splitting into
two) processes, respectively. As show in Fig. 2d, the W+
of FeSb3 are distinctly larger than those of CoSb3 by
several times in the low frequency (< 3.5 THz) region,
and the W− of FeSb3 show much larger values in the
wide frequency region below 5 THz as well. The origin
of the signiﬁcantly enhanced W± of FeSb3 lies in its dis-
tinct phonon spectrum. Comparing with that of CoSb3
(Fig. 4b), the phonon spectrum of FeSb3 (Fig. 4a) shows
a clear softening for the lowest optical branch (down to
below 2 THz). This optical branch is even lower in fre-
quency than the La-derived rattling mode in LaFe4Sb12
(Fig. 4c), and is not far away from the extremely low
frequency Yb-derived mode in YbFe4Sb12 (cyan curve in
Fig. 4c). Actually it is not only the lowest optical branch,
but several adjacent upper optical branches that become
softened in FeSb3. This is unambiguously reﬂected by a
sharp PHDOS peak appearing around 2 THz (Fig. 4e). It
is located in the region similar to that of the La-derived
rattling modes in LaFe4Sb12 (blue dash line in Fig. 4e).
The low-lying optical phonons overlaps more with the
acoustic branches, appreciably increases the phase space
W± for three-phonon scattering processes (Fig. 2d). This
reduces signiﬁcantly phonon lifetimes, which is the main
root cause for the ultralow κl of FeSb3.

Fig. 4d shows the vibration pattern of the lowest op-

Sb4 ring, a typical quasi-molecular motif in skutterudites.
The softening of this optical mode in FeSb3 originates
from the weaker Sb-Sb bonds of the Sb4 ring, as demon-
strated by the electron localization function contour plot
in Fig. 5. Clearly the electrons in the Sb4 ring of FeSb3
are much less localized than the case of CoSb3. This
indicates the rather weaker Sb-Sb bonds in FeSb3, as
expected from its electron deﬁcient nature. This is con-
sistent with the fact that the Young modulus of FeSb3 is
smaller than that of CoSb3 [40, 41]. As the result, the
phonon modes that are mainly dominated by Sb atoms
(below 6 THz) show general softening in FeSb3 (Fig. 4e).
The softening also occurs to the acoustic phonons, espe-
cially the transverse modes (Fig. 4b), which leads to the
moderately reduced averaged phonon velocity of FeSb3 in
Fig. 2b. In addition to the phonon softening, the weaker

4

Sb-Sb bonds in FeSb3 results in abnormal Gr¨uneisen pa-
rameters (γ) of phonons (Fig. 4a). For the low-lying op-
tical branches and the transverse acoustic phonons, the
values of γ are negative (in red) and quite large in mag-
nitude. Such phonon modes with the large magnitude γ
in principle facilitate high lattice anharmonicity [49] and
thus low κl. The negative sign of γ for the low-lying op-
tical branches implies that they will be further softened
under contraction. This is expected to cause the more
overlapping with acoustic phonons, more enhanced W±
and thus even lower κl at high pressures.

For the ﬁlled skutterudites, the electrons of ﬁller trans-
fer to the host framework following the Zintl behav-
ior. These electrons primarily distribute on the Sb4
ring, which considerably strengthens the Sb-Sb covalent
bonds, as indicated in Fig. 5c for the LaFe4Sb12 case.
This is consistent with the band structure of skutteru-
dites, which shows a light Sb derived band at the top of
the valence bands [50]. This may also explain why ﬁlled
Fe-based skutterudites are easier to form than FeSb3 usu-
ally stabilized in ﬁlms [37, 39, 40]. If one considers only
the fact that the strengthened Sb-Sb bonds after La ﬁll-
ing lift the Sb-derived optical branches in LaFe4Sb12, an
increase of κl is expected. In fact, the La ﬁller derived
rattling modes take the role to remarkably enhance W±.
As the result κl of LaFe4Sb12 is still much lower than that
of CoSb3, and only about three times larger than that of
FeSb3. For the case of YbFe4Sb12, the Yb derived even
lower frequency and rather ﬂat optical phonon branches
increase W± more signiﬁcantly, resulting in the more re-
duced κl [34].

function within the (100) plane of (a) FeSb3, (b) CoSb3 and

To summarize, we report a discovery of ultralow lat-
tice thermal conductivity (κl) of pure skutterudite FeSb3
with no ﬁller by using ﬁrst principles Boltzmann-Peierls
transport simulations. The calculated κl
is only 1.14
W/mK at room temperature, one order of magnitude
lower than that of CoSb3. It is even lower than the values
of the most fully ﬁlled skutterudites. This is in contrast
to the generally accepted approach where ﬁlling is used
for reduction of κl in skutterudites. The origin of the ul-
tralow κl is attributed to the remarkably softened optical
phonon branches associated with the weaker Sb-Sb bonds
in FeSb3 owing to its electron deﬁcient nature. These low

frequency optical phonons, having similar frequencies to
those of the rattling modes in ﬁlled skutterudites, take
the role of the rattling modes. They overlap more with
the heat-carrying acoustic phonons and increase signiﬁ-
cantly the phase space of three-phonon anharmonic scat-
tering processes. This leads to much reduced phonon
lifetimes, and thus very low intrinsic κl. By ﬁnding the
intrinsic ultralow κl of an unﬁlled skutterudite, our re-
sults oﬀer new insight into the still debated mechanism
responsible for the reduction of κl upon ﬁlling in skut-
terudites. Finally we evaluate the maximum mean free
path of phonons for bulk FeSb3 and ﬁnd the value smaller
than 600 nm (Supplementary Fig. S3), suggesting that
the experimentally synthesized FeSb3 ﬁlms [40] can be
directly applied to verify our theoretical prediction.

The ﬁrst principles calculations of lattice thermal conductivity (κl) are performed by solving the linearized
Boltzmann-Peierls transport equation of phonons [1]. All the contributions from two-phonon and three-phonon
scattering processes responsible for intrinsic κl of crystalline materials are included. Brieﬂy the isotopic κl of cubic
skutterudies at temperature T can be represented as the sum of contributions over each phonon mode λ (with branch
p and wave vector q):

where N is the number of q points uniformly sampled in the phonon Brillouin zone, V is the unit cell volume, Cλ is
the phonon mode heat capacity, fλ(ωλ, T ) is the Bose-Einstein distribution form that is the function of the phonon
frequency ωλ and T, υα
λ is the phonon group velocity along the α direction, and τλ is the phonon lifetime. In bulk
materials without impurities, τλ is determined by the processes of two-phonon scattering from isotopic disorder and
In the relaxation time approximation, τλ is equal to a sum of the isotope
three-phonon anharmonic scattering.

The available experimental data for CoSb3 [6] and LaFe4Sb12 [7] are shown for comparison. The agreement between our calcu-
lation and the experiments is good. In addition to this comparison, the validity of our ﬁrst principles calculations
is also indicated by the comparison of κl for CoSb3 between our theory and available experiments in Fig. 1 of
the main text, as well as the following comparison of phonon spectrum for LaFe4Sb12 (Fig. S2).

FIG. S3. (color online) The normalized cumulative κl of FeSb3 as a function of the phonon mean free path (lph) at 300 K. The
maximum lph among all the modes, which corresponds to the onset point of the cumulative κl becoming constant (equal to
1.0), is indicated. The purpose of this calculation is to provide a reference to future experimental measurements
for how thick thin-ﬁlm samples are required to take on the intrinsic κl of bulk FeSb3 we calculated here.
According to our result, the maximum lph is less than 600 nm. The sample size above this value is needed to
safely avoid surface and grain boundary scatterings. Therefore the experimentally synthesized FeSb3 ﬁlms with
the thicknesses of 1.0-1.5 µm [6] may be directly applied to measure the intrinsic κl and verify our theoretical
prediction.
