ABSTRACT
We use near infrared integral ﬁeld unit (IFU) spectroscopy to search for Hα emission associ-
ated with star formation in a sample of 28 heavily reddened (E(B − V ) ≃ 0.5 − 1.9), hyper-
luminous (log(Lbol/ergs−1) ≃ 47 − 48) broad-line quasars at z ≃ 1.4-2.7. Sixteen of the 28
quasars show evidence for star formation with an average extinction-corrected star formation
rate (SFR) of 320 ± 70 M⊙yr−1. A stacked spectrum of the detections shows weak [NII], con-
sistent with star formation as the origin of the narrow Hα emission. The star-forming regions
are spatially unresolved in 11 of the 16 detections and constrained to lie within ∼6 kpc of the
quasar emission. In the ﬁve resolved detections we ﬁnd the star-forming regions are extended
on scales of ∼8 kpc around the quasar emission. The prevalence of high SFRs is consistent
with the identiﬁcation of the heavily reddened quasar population as representing a transitional
phase from apparent ‘starburst galaxies’ to optically-luminous quasars. Upper limits are de-
termined for 10 quasars in which star formation is undetected. In two of the quasars the SFR
is constrained to be relatively modest, <50 M⊙yr−1, but signiﬁcantly higher levels of star
formation could be present in the other eight quasars. The combination of the 16 strong star
formation detections and the eight high SFR limits means that high levels of star formation
may be present in the majority of the sample. Higher spatial resolution data, of multiple emis-
sion lines, will allow us to better understand the interplay between star formation and Active
Galactic Nucleus (AGN) activity in these transitioning quasars.

1 INTRODUCTION

The discovery of the correlation between the bulge mass and
the black-hole mass of nearby galaxies (Magorrian et al. 1998;
Tremaine et al. 2002) lead to the prediction that the central black
hole of a galaxy plays a vital role in determining the ﬁnal stellar
mass of the galactic bulge. Understanding this link in galaxies at
z ∼ 2 − 3, when the majority of galaxy assembly and black-hole
accretion is occurring, is therefore important to understand the for-
mation and evolution of massive galaxies.

In the evolutionary picture ﬁrst postulated by Sanders et al.
(1988) infra-red luminous galaxies and quasars are different obser-
vational manifestations of the same phenomena. In the sequence il-
lustrated by Hopkins et al. (2008), massive galaxies are thought to
form hierarchically through major mergers (e.g. Narayanan et al.
2010). The merger induces a luminous starburst, enshrouding
the galaxy in dust such that the starburst appears bright at far
infra-red wavelengths. This emission is redshifted to submillime-
tre wavelengths for systems at z ∼2 and therefore the popula-
tion of dusty galaxies are termed Submillimetre Galaxies (SMGs;
e.g. Blain et al. 2002, Smail et al. 2004, Swinbank et al. 2004,
Chapman et al. 2005). The star formation triggers black-hole accre-

tion and as the dust and gas clear from the decaying starburst, the
central nuclear region is revealed as an unobscured quasar. Feed-
back from the central Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) eventually
shuts off star formation within the quasar host and then the galaxy
evolves passively into a red and dead elliptical (e.g. Springel et al.
2005a,b; Croton et al. 2006; Hopkins & Beacom 2006).

The evolutionary scenario can be tested by observing the tran-
sition phase from massive starburst to unobscured quasar, during
which the quasar will be enshrouded in dust and will therefore
appear as a reddened quasar. This blowout phase (Di Matteo et al.
2005) is expected to be short-lived based on estimates of the vol-
ume density of far infra-red bright quasars at 2 < z < 3 (∼1 Myr
estimated by Simpson et al. 2012) and therefore large volumes
must be observed to detect these systems.

Banerji et al. (2012, 2013) and Banerji et al. (2015) (hereafter
Paper I) present the results of searching for dust-reddened Type
1 broad-line quasars using the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Sur-
vey (UKIDSS) Large Area Survey (LAS; Lawrence et al. 2007),
the Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy (VISTA)
Hemisphere Survey (VHS; McMahon et al. 2013) and the Wide In-
frared Survey Explorer (WISE; Wright et al. 2010) All-Sky Survey.

These studies provide a well deﬁned sample of luminous and very
massive dust-reddened quasars at z ∼ 2 − 3. In Paper I we ﬁnd
evidence that the number of reddened quasars exceeds that of the
unobscured quasars at very high luminosities such that they are the
dominant population of high luminosity quasars at z ∼ 2 − 3, the
main epoch of galaxy formation. We suggest that they represent a
short phase in the evolution of massive galaxies, corresponding to
high intrinsic luminosities and obscurations.

In Paper I we utilise near infra-red Integral Field Unit (IFU)
observations of the reddened quasar sample, performed using VLT-
SINFONI (Spectrograph for INtegral Field Observations in the
Near Infrared), by considering a single integrated spectrum per ob-
ject. In this paper we now utilise the spatially resolved IFU obser-
vations to explore the star forming properties of the quasar host
galaxies. Integral Field Spectroscopy provides a spectrum in each
spatial pixel (spaxel) of a two dimensional ﬁeld of view and the
narrow Hα emission lines in each spaxel allow the ionized gas dis-
tribution to be determined.

IFU observations of high redshift systems have been used to
study the morphological and kinematic properties of star form-
ing galaxies by tracing the narrow Hα emission associated with
star formation (e.g F¨orster-Schreiber et al. 2009). Hα IFU ob-
servations of SMGs have found that these systems are made
of multiple components, with dynamically disturbed gas mo-
tions, providing evidence that these intense starbursts are merger
induced (Swinbank et al. 2005, 2006; Alaghband-Zadeh et al.
2012; Men´endez-Delmestre et al. 2013). IFU observations of the
[OIII]λλ4959, 5007 emission-line doublet have been used to ex-
plore the dynamics of galaxies hosting AGN, ﬁnding evidence
for outﬂows of gas (e.g. Alexander et al. 2010; Harrison et al.
2012, 2014). In the reddened quasar sample, the combination
of a powerful accreting black-hole and large amounts of dust
is predicted to drive strong outﬂows due to the effects of ra-
diation pressure on dust (Fabian 2012). It is possible that out-
ﬂows may both enhance or inhibit the host galaxy star formation
(Silk & Rees 1998; Silk 2005; Zubovas et al. 2013; Farrah et al.
2012; Zinn et al. 2013; Ishibashi et al. 2013; Barai et al. 2014). Star
formation has been found to be suppressed in the outﬂow regions
of z∼2 quasars (Cano-D´ıaz et al. 2012; Cresci et al. 2015) demon-
strating how AGN feedback can be probed using resolved IFU stud-
ies.

A challenge of studying the star formation properties of quasar
host galaxies is the need to separate the quasar emission (e.g.
broad Hα line) from the host galaxy emission (e.g. narrow Hα
line). Combining adaptive optics with integral ﬁeld spectroscopy
has proved to be effective (Inskip et al. 2011). Vayner et al. (2014)
demonstrate that this method enables the broad Hα emission from
the quasar to be disentangled from the narrow emission associated
with the host galaxy in z ∼ 2 quasars. Two quasars are found to
have star formation offset from the quasar nuclei and star formation
limits are constrained for the rest of the sample. In the nearby Uni-
verse, IFU observations have been used to decompose the narrow
and broad Hα emission, from star formation and the AGN respec-
tively, in a sample of low redshift Type 1 quasars (Husemann et al.
2014) resulting in the ﬁnding that over half the sample exhibit star
formation on kiloparsec scales.

In this paper we explore the star formation properties of our
z∼2 reddened quasar sample, making use of the high resolution
VLT-SINFONI observations. In Section 2 we summarise the obser-
vations and reduction of the data, in Section 3 we describe the anal-
ysis techniques used to determine the star formation rates (SFRs)
and place constraints on the locations of the star forming regions.

In Section 4 we explore the implications of our results. All cal-
culations assume a ﬂat, ΛCDM cosmology with ΩΛ = 0.7 and
H0 = 71 kms−1Mpc−1 in which 0.7 arcsec corresponds to a phys-
ical scale of ∼6 kpc at z = 2.3 (the median seeing and redshift of
our observations and targets respectively).

2 OBSERVATIONS AND REDUCTION

We observed 23 reddened quasars with the near infra-red IFU VLT-
SINFONI in 2013 and ﬁve with VLT-SINFONI in 2009. Details
of the object selection and the observations are given in Paper I
and Banerji et al. (2012) respectively. Our observations targeted the
redshifted Hα emission line which lies in the H and K bands for
our sample of sources with redshifts of 1.4 < z < 2.7. The 2009
observations used the SINFONI H+K ﬁlter (R=1500 covering a
range of 1.45−2.45 µm) and the 2013 observations used the K ﬁl-
ter only (R=4000 covering 1.9−2.5 µm). For both SINFONI pro-
grammes we made use of the largest ﬁeld of view (8×8 arcsec)
which gives a pixel scale of 0.250×0.125 arcsec which is resam-
pled to 0.125×0.125 arcsec in the ﬁnal combined cubes. Each
source was moved around four quadrants of the IFU (at offsets of
±1.5 arcsec from the centre of the IFU) to enable simultaneous sky
subtraction. The resulting area with 100% exposure was therefore
5×5 arcsec which corresponds to ∼40×40 kpc at z = 2.3 (the me-
dian redshift of our sample).
The data were reduced using the standard SINFONI ESOREX
pipeline which includes extraction, sky subtraction, wavelength
calibration, and ﬂat-ﬁelding. We spatially aligned and co-added the
cubes from each observation block using an average with a 10σ
clipping threshold. We also applied a 3 × 3-pixel median ﬁlter to
the co-added spatial images at each wavelength, replacing individ-
ual pixels with values |(Ipixel − Imedian)|/(1.48×MAD)>7.0 with
the median value. The MAD (median absolute deviation) was cal-
culated from the distribution of |(Ipixel − Imedian)| values for all
pixels in the image. Care was taken to ensure that the replacement
threshold did not affect pixels associated with the centroids of the
targets. The result of the ﬁltering were data cubes with a vastly
reduced number of spurious, single-pixel, non-Gaussian artifacts
and noise. We carried out relative ﬂux calibration by observing
bright standard stars throughout the nights on which the observing
blocks were performed. We were then able to perform the absolute
ﬂux calibration by comparing the integrated K-band ﬂuxes of the
sources to those measured from broad band VHS/UKIDSS K-band
observations of the targets.

In Table 1 we list the object identiﬁcations, redshifts and best-
ﬁt E(B − V )s for the targets. The error in the E(B − V ) values
is ∼0.1 mag. The E(B − V ) values are derived using SED ﬁts to
the available broadband photometry that probe rest-frame optical
wavelengths where the choice of extinction curve makes little dif-
ference to the inferred E(B−V ) values. Further details of these de-
rived properties are given in Paper I and Banerji et al. (2012). Table
1 also includes the exposure times and the seeing of the SINFONI
observations. The seeing values are derived by integrating the three
dimensional IFU observations of the (unresolved) quasar emission,
collapsing along the wavelength axis, to create maps of the inte-
grated ﬂux from which we can measure the spatial Full Width at
Half Maximum (FWHM) of the Point Spread Function (PSF). We
measure the velocity resolution of the observations by determining
the width of the sky lines close to the redshifted Hα line (i.e. the
velocity centre of the observations). For the 2009 SINFONI obser-

Table 1. The positions, redshifts and reddenings for the targets. The error in the E(B − V ) values is ∼0.1 mag. The top section details the newest SINFONI
sample (Paper I) and the bottom section details the older SINFONI sample described in Banerji et al. (2012). The redshifts are derived from the centroids of
single Gaussian proﬁles ﬁt to the broad Hα lines, as described in Paper I. We also list the exposure times of the observations and the size of the seeing disk
(the FWHM in arcsec of the PSF). We list the 1σ ﬂux limits of the observations, corresponding to the noise in PSF-aperture spatial regions offset from the
central broad-line emission. These are calculated assuming a σ=100 kms−1 Gaussian proﬁle, for a σ=200 kms−1 Gaussian proﬁle these ﬂux limits should be
multiplied by √2 to allow for the doubling in the wavelength region.

vations the resolution is σ ∼90 kms−1 and for the 2013 SINFONI
observations the resolution is σ ∼50 kms−1 (Paper I).

2.1 Noise Properties

The exposure times for the VLT-SINFONI observations in 2013
were adjusted for each target at the telescope to ensure the broad
Hα line was detected. Exposure times therefore vary as a function
of sky conditions, the K-band magnitudes and the strength of the
broad Hα emission of the individual sources (Table 1). The result-
ing range in spectrum ﬂux sensitivity is signiﬁcant (Table 1). As a
consequence, star-formation rate sensitivities across the sample are
very different, which should be noted when interpreting the results.
The wavelength-dependent noise for all the targets is domi-
nated by the signal from the sky, with strong wavelength-dependent
variations due to the presence of individual sky emission features.
The noise at a given wavelength can be determined from the am-
plitude of ﬂux-variations calculated using PSF-aperture spatial re-
gions, σ(λ)PSF that lie offset from the central AGN broad-line, i.e.
excluding any ’signal’ remaining after the broad-emission line sub-
traction for each object. The wavelength-dependence of the noise is

c(cid:13) 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

essentially identical, with only the amplitude (from σMAD
ing from target to target.

1) vary-

Treating the two observing runs (2009 and 2013) separately,
we constructed a master wavelength-dependent noise-spectrum by
combining the results from the off-centre PSF-aperture regions of
all the targets. The master noise-spectrum was then scaled using the
value of σMAD for each target.

3 ANALYSIS AND RESULTS

To explore the star formation in the reddened quasar sample we
must disentangle the Hα emission, originating from the quasar
broad line region, from any narrow Hα line emission, originating
from star formation in the quasar host galaxy.

The total emission proﬁle is dominated by broad Hα line

lute deviation of the noise, σMAD, for the PSF-aperture regions, integrated
across the H- and/or K-bands.

emission from the quasar. The emission is unresolved and thus ap-
pears in the data cubes as a PSF, with a proﬁle set by the observing
conditions. An example map of this broad emission, created by in-
tegrating a cube in the velocity axis over the the Hα line (from Hα-
12000 kms−1 to Hα+12000 kms−1) is shown in the top left panel
in Fig. 1. For each source we set the central velocity (i.e. 0 kms−1)
at the velocity centroid of the broad Hα emission (see Paper I). In
the following analysis we search for evidence of narrow Hα emis-
sion after subtracting the broad Hα proﬁle from the cubes.

3.1 Assumptions

We search for narrow emission with linewidths of σ=100 kms−1
and 200 kms−1, corresponding to narrow Hα arising due to star
formation in the host galaxy as opposed to originating from the
Narrow Line Region (NLR) associated with the AGN. We per-
form further tests on the lines detected in Section 3.2.3 to con-
ﬁrm the star formation origin. The σ=100 kms−1 and 200 kms−1
linewidths correspond to de-convolved linewidths of 40 kms−1 and
180 kms−1 for the 2009 observations and 90 kms−1 and 190 kms−1
for the 2013 observations. Our choice of velocity widths are consis-
tent with the properties of narrow Hα observed in SMGs (with no
evidence for AGN affecting the spectra) owing to the star formation
in these galaxies (Swinbank et al. 2004; Alaghband-Zadeh et al.
2012).

Star formation rates corrected for extinction are calculated us-
ing the reddenings, given in Table 1, assuming a value of Rv=3.1.
We make the assumption that the extinction is the same towards
the quasar as towards the star forming regions. If the extinctions
towards the star forming regions are lower, the derived extinction-
corrected star formation rates will be over-estimated.

3.2 Procedure

In order to search for a narrow component of Hα we must subtract
off the broad Hα emission (Fig. 1). The broad Hα emission spec-
trum is determined by summing the spectra of each spaxel lying
within a circular aperture centred on the AGN. The radius of this
circular aperture is the distance from the centre at which, for the
unresolved quasar emission, the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) within
the circle is a maximum (see Fig. 1), therefore giving the optimal
estimate of the broad line proﬁle. We deﬁne this circular aperture as
the ‘PSF-aperture’. We note that the ‘PSF-aperture’ does not con-
tain the entire ﬂux from the quasar since the spatial proﬁle of the
quasar emission will extend beyond this region. Indeed ≃32 per
cent of the total ﬂux from the unresolved emission lies outside the
‘PSF-aperture’ and therefore an aperture correction must be applied
to give the total ﬂuxes. This correction must be applied when cal-
culating the total ﬂuxes of all unresolved emission, including any
unresolved narrow Hα emission we ﬁnd in the following analysis.
The resulting broad Hα emission spectra for each source are
shown in Figure A2 of Paper I. We then ﬁt a single or double
broad-Gaussian proﬁle to each spectrum. The FWHMs of the sin-
gle proﬁle or both components of the double proﬁle are constrained
to be >1000 kms−1 and <10000 kms−1 in the ﬁt. We choose
to use a double Gaussian proﬁle only in the cases where the ﬁt
is signiﬁcantly improved by the addition of the second compo-
nent, as in Paper I. The FWHMs of the broad line ﬁts range from
1000−9600 kms−1.
Any narrow Hα emission may be coincident in velocity with
the broad Hα proﬁle and therefore included in the overall Gaussian

ﬁts mentioned above. To identify any such emission we search the
residuals from the broad Gaussian ﬁt for regions of excess positive
ﬂux on scales of ∼100 kms−1 and exclude these spectral regions
in the next ﬁt iteration (illustrated in Fig. 1). This ﬁnal ﬁt repre-
sents the deﬁned broad line proﬁle to be subtracted from the spectra
across the cube.

We re-bin the cube such that the spectrum in each spaxel is re-
placed with the sum of the spectra from the spaxels in the surround-
ing region of the size of the PSF-aperture. In this way we therefore
search for narrow Hα emission in PSF-apertures across the ﬁeld
of view. The broad-line proﬁle is then subtracted from each binned
spaxel in the data cube with an amplitude, k, determined using the
maximum-likelihood technique (e.g. Hewett et al. 1985) where

k =

Σi(Pi/σi)2
and Si is the spectrum (with i wavelength steps) in each
spaxel, Pi is the broad proﬁle deﬁned above and σi is the wave-
length dependent noise (Section 2.1).

After subtracting the broad-line proﬁle from each binned
spaxel we search the resultant residual spectra for narrow Hα
emission, assumed to possess a Gaussian proﬁle with widths of
σ=100 kms−1 or 200 kms−1 (see Sections 3.1 and 3.2.1). At each
wavelength, the amplitude and χ2 of the two Gaussian proﬁles is
calculated, using velocity intervals of 600 kms−1 or 1200 kms−1
(for the 100 kms−1 or 200 kms−1 search respectively). Fig. 2 shows
how the S/N and χ2 values change across an example spectrum
containing a narrow Hα line when searching for a σ=200 kms−1
Gaussian proﬁle.

3.2.1 Criteria for detections

Hα emission from star-formation is expected to be present at rela-
tively low S/N. The number of potential locations in position and
velocity searched is large: ∼80000 locations within ±1000 kms−1
of the systemic velocity and ±20 kpc from the location of the
quasar centre for each source are searched in the 2013 sample. In
the 2009 sample, with the lower spectral resolution, ∼30000 loca-
tions are searched for each source. False-positive detections are of
particular concern, therefore we choose a conservative S/N thresh-
old of S/N>5 for our narrow Hα detections. The appropriateness of
the S/N>5 threshold was veriﬁed from stacking the narrow Hα de-
tections with S/N>5 (Fig. 5) and ﬁnding evidence for the presence
of a weak [NII]λ0.6583µm signal (see Section 3.2.3).

The Gaussian-proﬁle template search, with the two velocity
widths σ=100 and 200 kms−1, retains sensitivity to the presence of
all emission features with widths σ .250 kms−1. The χ2 values
do, however, increase for features that do not match the Gaussian
proﬁles of either speciﬁc velocity-width. A relaxed χ2-threshold of
χ2 <4 was adopted to ensure any such features were not excluded
from the search.

The area with 100 per cent exposure in our observations
is 5×5 arcsec and our emission-line search extends over an
area of 4×4 arcsec centred on the quasar, which corresponds to
∼30×30 kpc at z=2.3 (the median redshift of our sample). Since
we search in overlapping PSF-apertures, real emission lines result
in multiple detections in neighbouring spaxels. In such cases we
ﬁrst take the location of the line detection to be the spaxel with the
highest S/N. After examination of these detections, we ﬁnd that the
locations of all the detections are within the PSF-sized aperture re-
gion centred around the quasar emission. The narrow emission is
therefore consistent with lying at the centre of the quasar and we

Figure 1. An example sequence (using VHSJ2355-0011) to illustrate the method used to search for narrow Hα emission. First we integrate the cube over
the broad Hα line (from Hα-12000 kms−1 to Hα+12000 kms−1) to create an estimate of the PSF. The radius at which the PSF-signal has maximum S/N is
determined and the signal from within the radius (the ‘PSF-aperture’) is used to provide the optimal estimate of the broad line proﬁle. We characterise the broad
line proﬁle by ﬁrst ﬁtting a single or double Gaussian proﬁle to the spectrum (blue line). The ﬁt requires that the Gaussian proﬁles must have FWHMs greater
than 1000 kms−1. Since it is possible that the narrow component may be spatially coincident with the broad line PSF, and therefore included in this spectrum,
the residuals of the initial ﬁt are searched for regions of excess positive ﬂux on scales of > 100kms−1 (red line). These regions are then excluded and the ﬁt
is recalculated (blue line). This ﬁnal ﬁt represents the broad line proﬁle to be subtracted from each spaxel region. We re-bin the spaxels such that each spaxel
contains the sum of the surrounding spaxels in a region the size of the PSF-aperture. We then subtract the broad proﬁle, using a maximum likelihood technique
to scale the proﬁle, from each spaxel region and search the proﬁle-subtracted cube for narrow Gaussian Hα emission with σ=100 kms−1 and 200 kms−1.

therefore present the spectra from the central PSF-apertures as the
detections in the following analysis.

After running the automated search for narrow Hα emission,
with the above detection criteria, we apply an additional check of
the broad Hα proﬁle subtraction, examining the residuals of the
ﬁt. In two of the sample (VHSJ2101-5943 and ULASJ2224-0015)
potential narrow Hα emission is found, meeting our detection cri-
teria. However, after subtracting the broad Hα proﬁle we ﬁnd that
the resulting spectra contain multiple large residuals in the region
of Hα±5000 kms−1, suggesting that the narrow emission features
are not real. In Figs. 3 and 4 we show the residuals of the broad sub-
tractions for VHSJ2101-5943 and ULASJ2224-0015 respectively.
The potential narrow emission found in our automated search for
VHSJ2101-5943 and ULASJ2224-0015 is shown in Figs. C7 and
C15 respectively, however we exclude these sources from the nar-
row Hα detection sample for the remainder of the analysis.

3.2.2 Search for extended emission

It is possible that the narrow emission we detect originates from
star forming regions that are extended beyond the size of the PSF-
apertures. In order to test for resolved, extended emission in the
sample of narrow Hα detections we increase the aperture size of

c(cid:13) 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

the binned cubes and re-run our narrow Hα emission search pro-
cedure. In ULASJ1002+0137, VHSJ2028-4631, VHSJ2144-0523,
VHSJ2235-5750 and VHSJ2332-5240 the S/N of the resulting nar-
row emission is improved by increasing the aperture size and there-
fore we ﬁnd ﬁve sources in which there is evidence for extended
and resolved star forming regions lying around the quasar centres.
The sizes of the larger apertures (listed in Table 2) correspond to
the aperture sizes at which the S/N of the detections are maxima.
In the analysis that follows we use the spectra from these larger
apertures.

3.2.3 Search for [NII]

Application of the search procedure described above results in the
detection of narrow Hα emission in 16 of the 28 reddened quasars.
In order to test whether the narrow emission arises due to star for-
mation in the quasar host galaxy or from the NLR of the AGN itself
we search the spectra for [NII] emission. Strong [NII] would indi-
cate that the narrow emission may originate from the NLR, whereas
weak [NII] would suggest a star-formation origin. Given the veloc-
ity centroid of the narrow Hα emission we can constrain the lo-
cation of the [NII] emission in each spectrum. We search only for
the stronger [NII] λrest=0.6583µm component of the [NII] doublet

Figure 5. The stacked spectra of 14 detections of narrow Hα emission (marked by the blue line) with the position of the [NII] lines marked by the red lines.
We do not include the 2 high S/N narrow Hα detections (VHSJ1556-0835 and ULASJ2200+0056) as discussed in Section 3.2.3. The ratio of [NII]/Hα in the
stack is 0.25±0.08.

given its suitability for discriminating between star-formation and
AGN origin of the Hα emission (e.g. Kewley et al. 2006). In each
of the 16 spectra, based on the velocity-width of the putative Hα
detection, we ﬁt a σ=100 kms−1 or 200 kms−1, Gaussian proﬁle at
the predicted position of the [NII] line.

Two of the sources (VHSJ1556-0835 and ULASJ2200+0056)
exhibit large residuals in the spectral region of [NII] following the
broad Hα proﬁle subtraction (shown in Figs. C2 and C13). Given
the high S/N detections of the narrow Hα in these two sources we
are conﬁdent that the residuals at the position of [NII] are not real
[NII] features. The narrow Hα emission in both cases is Gaussian
shaped, whereas the excess ﬂux at the position of [NII] is highly
non-Gaussian, therefore not matching the narrow Hα line features.
For these two sources we are therefore unable to constrain the real
[NII] emission. The origin of the excess ﬂux may be from poor
characterisation of the broad Hα line, for example if it is not well
ﬁt by a single or double Gaussian proﬁle, such that the broad sub-
traction leaves excess ﬂux at the location of [NII]. Narrow [NII]
associated with the narrow Hα may be present but the extent of the
residuals precludes any reliable measurement. In the analysis that
follows we include VHSJ1556-0835 and ULASJ2200+0056 in our
sample of star-formation detections, since we cannot rule out that
the narrow Hα emission arises due to star formation, however we
do not include these two sources in the stack of the detections (Fig.
5) since we use the stack to constrain the low S/N [NII] emission
for the sample.

The stack of the 14 remaining detections is shown in
Fig. 5 and we constrain the [NII]/Hα ratio for
the stack
as [NII]/Hα=0.25±0.08. The low [NII]/Hα ratio is consistent
with a star-formation origin (e.g. Kewley et al. 2006 who ﬁnd
[NII]/Hα<0.7 as indicative of star formation).

For VHSJ2235-5750 we detect [NII] with a S/N>5 and there-
fore we can establish the [NII]/Hα ratio of 0.45±0.09. Since this
ratio is <0.7 we are conﬁdent of the star-formation the origin of the
narrow Hα emission for this source. For the 13 remaining detec-

tions we quote the limits on the [NII]/Hα ratio in Table 2. The up-
per limit of the [NII] ﬂux is the 5σ limit, from our S/N>5 detection
criteria. In nine of the detections the upper limits to the [NII]/Hα
ratio are <0.7 indicating that the narrow Hα emission is from star
formation. In the remaining four detections the upper limits to the
[NII]/Hα ratio are >0.7 and it is possible that the narrow Hα emis-
sion originates from the NLR, however, since only upper limits are
available we retain the sources in our sample of objects possessing
evidence of star formation.

3.3 Results

In Figs. C1 to C18 we show the maps and spectra of the 16 star
formation detections, along with the corresponding noise spectra.
In Fig 6 we show an example detection of the narrow emission in
VHSJ2355-0011. The maps of the detections are made by integrat-
ing the broad Hα proﬁle-subtracted cubes from the centre of the
narrow line ±150 kms−1 or ±300 kms−1, corresponding to 1.5σ
for the 100 kms−1 and 200 kms−1 search respectively. The proﬁle-
subtracted cubes are made by subtracting the broad line proﬁle
(scaled using the maximum likelihood technique) from the spec-
trum in each binned spaxel. The spaxels are binned such that each
spaxel represents the sum of the surrounding spaxels in a PSF-
aperture sized region. For each detection we present the spectrum
originating from the binned spaxel at the quasar centre, in which
there is evidence for narrow Hα emission.

Table 2 lists the extinction-corrected star-formation rates
(assuming the Calzetti et al. (2000) reddening law) using the
relation between Hα luminosity and star formation rate from
Kennicutt & Evans (2012):
log(SFRHα/M⊙yr−1) = log(LHα/ergs−1) − 41.27

In Table 2 we quote the star formation rates using the Hα ﬂux
within the PSF-apertures for the unresolved sample (SFRaperture).
The PSF-aperture is deﬁned as a circle with a radius at which, for

Figure 6. Left: Map of the narrow Hα emission in VHSJ2355-0011, created by integrating the proﬁle-subtracted cube from the centre of the narrow line
±150 kms−1 (1.5σ). The proﬁle-subtracted cube is made by subtracting the broad line proﬁle (scaled using the maximum likelihood technique) from the
spectrum in each binned spaxel. The spaxels are binned such that each spaxel represents the sum of the surrounding spaxels in a PSF-aperture sized region.
The black cross marks the quasar centre and corresponds to the aperture in which the total spectrum has evidence for a narrow Gaussian of width σ=100 kms−1.
We show the FWHM of the PSF-aperture by the black line in the bottom, right-hand corner. Top Right: The total spectrum from the aperture at the quasar
centre with the scaled Gaussian overlayed. Bottom Right: The noise spectrum (as detailed in Section 2.1).

an unresolved point source, the S/N of the emission is a maximum
(see Section 3.2) and ≃32 per cent of the total ﬂux lies outside the
aperture. We therefore apply an aperture-correction to calculate the
total star formation rate (SFRtotal). For objects with resolved de-
tections, the Hα ﬂux within the extended aperture is used to derive
the star formation rate. Sizes, in kpc, of the star forming regions are
also given. The sizes correspond to the FWHMs of the apertures for
the resolved detections and to the FWHMs of the PSF-apertures (as
upper limits) for the unresolved detections.

While we explore the spatial positions of the narrow Hα detec-
tions we do not analyse the velocity offsets of the narrow Hα emis-
sion from the systemic velocities since the centroids of the broad
Hα emission are themselves not tightly constrained.

In Fig. 7 we show the star formation rates against

the
star forming region sizes. The average star formation rate is
320±70 M⊙yr−1 for the 16 quasars in which we detect narrow
Hα emission. We ﬁnd extended, resolved emission in ﬁve sources
with star forming regions of 8±1 kpc around the quasar centre. The
emission is unresolved in the remainder of the sample, typically
constrained to lie within ∼6 kpc of the quasar centres (the angular
resolution of the observations)

3.4 Star formation rate limits

In the sources without detected narrow Hα emission, upper limits
on the star-formation rates may be derived via a series of simula-
tions. We add three-dimensional Gaussian proﬁles to the data cubes
(in RA, Dec and velocity space) with spatial widths that match the
seeing of the observations (the broad Hα PSF spatial proﬁle) and
a velocity width of σ=100 kms−1. The input proﬁles are placed at
the quasar centres and the minimum intensity necessary to produce
a ’detection’, using our search procedure, is determined. In Table
2 we quote the resulting upper limits of the star formation rates,
assuming the star forming region lies within the PSF region. In our
test we assume velocity widths of σ=100 kms−1 for out input nar-
row Hα emission. We note that to place limits on narrow emission
with widths of σ=200 kms−1 the σ=100 kms−1 limits would need
to be scaled up by a factor of √2 to take into account the doubling
in the velocity range of the noise calculation. In two sources the

c(cid:13) 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

limits on the star formation rates are <50 M⊙yr−1 indicating that
these systems may contain very little star formation.

For ULASJ1234+0907 (Banerji et al. 2014) we have also per-
formed narrow-band Hα imaging observations (detailed in Ap-
pendix A). Above, we ﬁnd that star formation within the PSF
(<6.1 kpc) must be <4600 M⊙yr−1, consistent with the conclu-
sion from the narrow band imaging, that the star formation must be
within the central 8 kpc.

4 DISCUSSION

We ﬁnd evidence for signiﬁcant star formation in 16 of 28 reddened
quasars (≃54 per cent) with an average Hα star formation rate of
320±70 M⊙yr−1 2. In the remaining quasars, our observations pro-
vide limits on the Hα star formation rates. In two of the sample star
formation rates of 50 M⊙yr−1 or lower are ruled out within the
central ∼6 kpc. High-redshift starburst galaxies have typical star
formation rates of ∼100 M⊙yr−1, therefore our limits could sug-
gest that such levels of star formation have already been quenched
in a fraction of the reddened quasar population. Alternatively, the
star formation may be distributed over wider areas than our (seeing-
determined) ≃<6 kpc resolution, thus eluding discovery in the pro-
cedure we have adopted. For the remaining eight quasars the limits
are not as constraining (<110 M⊙yr−1 to <4600 M⊙yr−1) there-
fore it is possible that there is signiﬁcant star formation within the
central ∼6 kpc of these quasars. Our ﬁndings are consistent with
the ∼71 per cent of quasar host galaxies found to be actively form-
ing stars in a sample of X-ray selected obscured quasars at z∼2
(Mainieri et al. 2011).
Observations of high-redshift unobscured luminous quasars,
made at far infrared and submillimetre wavelengths, have shown
that approximately a quarter of the unobscured sample are bright in
the far infrared and therefore are likely associated with recent star

2 The star formation rates we derive assume that the extinctions towards
the star formation regions are the same as towards the quasars, however, the
extinctions may be smaller at locations offset from the quasar nucleus hence
the extinction-corrected star formation rates could be over-estimated.

Table 2. The ﬂuxes and star formation rates of the narrow Hα emission. We quote both the extinction corrected star formation rates and the rates uncorrected
for extinction. For the unresolved detections we also scale the extinction corrected SFRs within the PSF-apertures to give the total aperture-corrected SFRs.
For the cases where we do not see any evidence for narrow Hα emission we quote the input SFR required to be added to the cubes (in the form of a narrow
Gaussian component) for the narrow component to be detected in our procedure (i.e. with S/N>5) as detailed in Section 3.4. For the unresolved detections we
quote the FWHM of the PSF in kpc as the limit on the size of the star forming regions around the quasar centres.The FWHM of the PSF is listed in arcsec
in Table 1. For the resolved emission we quote the FWHM of the aperture size that maximises the S/N of the detections. We quote the upper limits to the
[NII]/Hα ratio for the sources with narrow Hα detections as detailed in Section 3.2.3. The upper limit to the [NII] ﬂux is the 5σ upper limit such that we match
the S/N>5 detection criteria.

formation (e.g. Omont et al. 2003; Priddey et al. 2003). A higher
fraction of the reddened quasars contain star formation compared
to similarly luminous blue quasars, although a direct comparison
is not possible because different star formation indicators are used
for the two populations. Hubble Space Telescope observations of
z∼1-2 unobscured luminous quasars have been used to estimate
mean star formation rates of ∼50-350 M⊙yr−1 (Floyd et al. 2013),
indicating that the reddened quasars exhibit higher levels of star
formation than the unobscured quasars.

The presence of high star formation rates, associated with
larger dust extinctions, provides a natural explanation for the ob-
served correlation between luminous reddened quasars and the
presence of signiﬁcant star formation. Far-infrared to millimetre
dust continuum observations have already constrained star for-
mation rates in three of our reddened quasars: ∼2000 M⊙yr−1
for ULASJ1234+0907 (Banerji et al. 2014), ∼275 M⊙yr−1 for
ULASJ1002+0137 (Brusa et al. 2014) and >250-1600 M⊙yr−1
for ULASJ1539+0557 (Feruglio et al. 2014). The average star for-
mation rate of 320±70 M⊙yr−1 we measure is consistent with the
rates deduced from far-infrared and millimetre dust continuum ob-
servations. The high level of star formation observed in our sample

is consistent with the hypothesis that the reddened quasars repre-
sent a post-merger stage in the evolution of massive galaxies in
which the merger has induced both a starburst and increased fu-
elling of the central supermassive black hole (e.g Hopkins et al.
2008).

We now draw comparisons between the typical scales of the
star-forming regions seen in our reddened quasars and those mea-
sured in other populations of star-forming galaxies and AGN.

4.1 Comparison to SMGs at z∼2
In the evolutionary sequence proposed by Hopkins et al. (2008),
merger induced star formation triggers accretion onto the central
black-holes of the galaxies such that the systems appear as dusty
(reddened) quasars. The dusty star forming galaxies of the SMG
population may then represent a phase that is followed by a red-
dened quasar phase. The average star formation rate we measure
in the reddened quasar sample of 320±70 M⊙yr−1 matches the
average Hα-derived star formation rate of the z∼2 SMGs stud-
ied in Alaghband-Zadeh et al. (2012) of 370±90 M⊙yr−1 (Fig. 7)

Figure 7. The total, i.e. aperture-corrected in the case of unresolved emission, star-formation rates derived from the narrow Hα emission as a function of the
radius within which the narrow Hα emission is constrained to originate. The radii correspond to the FWHM of the PSF of the broad Hα emission for the
unresolved emission and the aperture size that maximises the S/N for the resolved emission. For sources without Hα emission detections we plot an upper
limit to the star-formation rate calculated as described in Section 3.4. We plot literature detections of star formation around other high-z quasars (Vayner et al.
2014; Cano-D´ıaz et al. 2012; Walter et al. 2009), z ∼0.7 reddened quasars (Urrutia et al. 2008, 2012) and also the predictions from hydrodynamical simu-
lations of mergers (Narayanan et al. 2009. We also show the range of extents of the star formation in SMGs from Hα observations (Swinbank et al. 2006;

(Alaghband-Zadeh et al. 2012). The scale of star formation observed in the majority of our reddened quasar sample is consistent with the observations of other
high-z quasars and the local reddened quasars.

indicating that powerful starbursts are occurring in the reddened
quasars, similar to the SMGs.

quasar host galaxies and SMGs would ideally be undertaken for
sub-populations of comparable total mass.

In the z∼2 SMGs, star formation observed through Hα
studies
(Swinbank et al. 2006; Alaghband-Zadeh et al. 2012;
Men´endez-Delmestre et al. 2013) is seen to be extended on scales
of ∼2-17 kpc, leading to the proposal that the SMGs consist of mul-
tiple merging components. Furthermore, in the AGN-SMG system
(SMMJ0217-0503; Alaghband-Zadeh et al. 2012) there is an offset
of ∼18 kpc between the AGN and the star-forming SMG compo-
nent. We ﬁnd evidence for extended star formation on scales of
∼8 kpc in ﬁve of our sample, consistent with the extended star for-
mation observed in the SMGs. In the majority of our sample the star
forming regions are constrained to lie within ∼6 kpc of the quasar
centres and therefore are at the lower end of the range of offsets in
SMGs (Fig. 7). It is possible that the reddened quasar phase rep-
resents a more advanced stage in a merger sequence, when the star
forming gas is more compact than observed in the SMGs. However,
a comparison between the star-forming properties of the reddened

In the hydrodynamic simulations of SMG mergers detailed in
Narayanan et al. (2009), the star formation rate during the ﬁrst pas-
sage and inspiral phases of the merger is ∼200 M⊙yr−1 (rising up
to ∼1000 M⊙yr−1 at ﬁnal coalescence) matching the average star
formation rates of our reddened quasar sample (320±70 M⊙yr−1).
In the simulations, the sizes of the 12CO(3-2) emission regions,
tracing the molecular gas and therefore the fuel for the star forma-
tion, are predicted to be ∼1.5 kpc during the star burst phase and
only extend up to ∼2.5 kpc for cases where the intense star burst
occurs at the early stages of the merger (Fig. 7). The origin of the
compact star formation in the simulations is the gas being pushed
into the centre during the merger. While the sizes are consistent
with the upper limits constrained from our observations, the sim-
ulations are tracing the molecular gas which fuels star formation,
whereas our Hα emission observations arise from ionized gas fol-
lowing the formation of massive stars.

tems with a wide range of separations, suggesting that the red-
dened quasar phase in the low-redshift sample may occur at differ-
ent stages of the merger process; from early on, where the merging
galaxies are still identiﬁable, through more advanced stages, where
multiple nuclei are observed, as well as in the ﬁnal coalescence
stage when tidal tails are visible.

Five of the low-redshift reddened quasar sample exhibit
more than one component, with separations of 1.2−9.2 kpc, and
starburst-like star formation rates of ∼100 M⊙yr−1 (calculated
using the far-infrared luminosities from Urrutia et al. 2012 and
Kennicutt & Evans 2012) as shown in Fig. 7. Our ﬁnding that star
formation is located within ∼6 kpc of the quasar nuclei in the ma-
jority of the high-redshift reddened quasar sample is consistent
with the component separations of these clumps (associated with
the quasar hosts) in the low-redshift sample. The similarity in the
spatial scales of the high rates of star-formation provides some sup-
port for associating the high-redshift reddened quasars with the late
stage (ﬁnal coalescence) of a galaxy merging event, as also found
by Glikman et al. (2015).

4.3 Comparison to high redshift quasars

Observations of the star formation rates and locations in unob-
scured quasars of comparable luminosity to our reddened quasars
are few in number. In a study of ﬁve z ∼ 2 quasars (Vayner et al.
2014; Fig. 7), two objects are found to possess star formation rates
of ∼40-110 M⊙yr−1 at distances of 2-4 kpc from the quasars, with
three non-detections. We therefore ﬁnd that a signiﬁcant fraction of
the reddened quasars are associated with more extreme star forma-
tion rates than is common for unobscured quasars, although the spa-
tial locations of the events may be consistent. Walter et al. (2009)
show that at z ∼6, an extreme star formation rate (1700 M⊙yr−1)
in a quasar host galaxy is conﬁned to the central ∼1 kpc (Fig. 7)
which they suggest may be the result of a merger, although they
do not rule out the possibility of infall of cold gas from streams
triggering the star formation (Dekel et al. 2009). The limits on the
sizes of the majority of our sample are not as constraining as the
compact star formation observed in this source, however we cannot
rule out that a similar origin may apply for our sample.

Urrutia et al. (2008) present Hubble Space Telescope observations
of low-redshift reddened quasars from the FIRST/2MASS Red
Quasar Survey (Glikman et al. 2007) ﬁnding that they exhibit mul-
tiple, interacting components and tidal tails, consistent with an ori-
gin in recent merger activity. Their sample is composed of sys-

4.4 Feedback

IFU observations enable both the spatial locations of star forming
regions to be determined and the effects of the AGN on the host
galaxy to be studied. Recent work supports a mixture of both posi-
tive and negative AGN-feedback affecting the host galaxy star for-
mation. More speciﬁcally, AGN outﬂows have been suggested both
to cause gas to condense to form stars and also remove (or heat) gas
and thus inhibit star formation (e.g. Silk & Rees 1998; Silk 2005;
Zubovas et al. 2013; Farrah et al. 2012; Zinn et al. 2013).

Ishibashi et al. (2013) suggest that star formation can occur
in AGN-feedback driven outﬂows and that the AGN-induced star
formation can explain a number of other galaxy properties such as
the evolution of their size and structure (Ishibashi & Fabian 2014).
In general, models predict signiﬁcant inﬂuence of an AGN-driven
ﬂow close to the AGN, whereas there is much less clarity regarding
the signiﬁcance of any AGN-induced activity on large scales. The
models of Nayakshin (2014) predict positive-feedback due to the
effect of the AGN on star formation in the early gas-rich phases of
galaxy evolution with negative feedback important on much larger
scales at later times. Our observations of star formation found to lie
in regions of ∼6 kpc around the quasar centre indicate that it is pos-
sible that the AGN has induced star formation in these systems on
these scales. However, higher resolution (likely AO assisted) IFU
observations are required to resolve the morphology and dynamics
of the star forming regions much closer to the quasar nuclei (<∼1-
3 kpc) such that AGN-induced star formation could be identiﬁed or
discounted. Positive AGN-feedback occurring at large offsets from
the nucleus has been suggested from observations of extended Lyα
around a quasar at z ∼3 (Rauch et al. 2013). We ﬁnd extended star
formation in ﬁve of our sample, on ∼8 kpc scales, suggesting that
AGN-driven outﬂows could trigger star formation on these scales.
The detection of kiloparsec scale molecular outﬂows in both
high redshift and local quasars (Feruglio et al. 2010; Cicone et al.
2012; Maiolino et al. 2012; Cicone et al. 2014) indicates that out-
ﬂows could affect star formation in host galaxies on the ∼5 kpc
scales of our star-formation detections. Both the resolved observa-
tions and the interpretation are however not straightforward (e.g.
Rupke & Veilleux 2011), particularly if both positive and negative
feedback occur with different spatial and temporal dependencies.
The large average star formation rate we measure for 16 quasars
within ∼6 kpc does not support strong negative feedback on such
scales in approximately half our sample. However negative feed-
back may be responsible for the two sources in which the star for-
mation rates are constrained to be <50 M⊙yr−1 suggesting very
little star formation is occurring in these host galaxies. The limits
on the star formation rates in the remaining eight quasars are not
constraining enough to rule out signiﬁcant star formation therefore
feedback effects cannot be assessed.

Cresci et al. (2015) combine their detections of narrow Hα
emission in ULASJ1002+0137 (see Appendix B) with [OIII] and
HST U-band observations and propose that ULASJ1002+0137
contains both positive and negative feedback. They detect an out-
ﬂow in [OIII] extending up to 13 kpc from the AGN; the AGN ap-
pears to reside in a region with little star formation, surrounded
by areas experiencing elevated star formation. Their interpreta-
tion invokes an outﬂow, which removes gas within the extent of
the outﬂow, therefore inhibiting star formation, while also induc-
ing star formation at the interface between the outﬂow and gas in
the host galaxy. A similar scenario is seen around a z∼2 quasar
(Cano-D´ıaz et al. 2012) in which extended star formation (on scales
of several kpc; Fig. 7) is observed, however, there is no star forma-

c(cid:13) 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

tion observed in the region where a strong outﬂow is detected in
[OIII]. To explore the various feedback effects further, and deter-
mine the fraction of reddened quasars which exhibit such a geom-
etry, a comparison to the resolved [OIII] emission in each source
is required. Complimentary [OIII] observations can be used to
compare the outﬂows and star formation morphologies. Higher-
resolution observations of multiple diagnostic emission lines will
enable the gas properties and kinematics to be studied, allowing the
importance of AGN-feedback in the evolution of the host galaxies
to be constrained.

5 CONCLUSIONS

We have utilised IFU observations to study the star formation prop-
erties of a sample of 28 reddened quasars at z ∼ 2, ﬁnding evidence
for star formation in 16 reddened quasars (i.e. 57%), with an aver-
age star formation rate of 320±70 M⊙yr−1. The star forming re-
gions detected are constrained to lie within ∼6 kpc of the central
AGN in the majority of the sample, however in ﬁve of the sample
there is evidence for resolved, extended emission around the quasar
centre on scales of ∼8 kpc. In two of the sources in which we do not
detect star formation the star formation rates are constrained to be
<50 M⊙yr−1 suggesting very little star formation is occurring in
these host galaxies. However, the limits on the star formation rates
for the remaining eight quasars are not as constraining, implying
that signiﬁcant star formation may be present in the majority of
our sample. Higher resolution observations of the star formation in
the reddened quasar sample are required to disentangle the poten-
tial positive and negative feedback effects of the AGN on the star
formation properties of its host galaxy.

APPENDIX A: ISAAC NARROW-BAND Hα IMAGING OF
ULASJ1234+0907

For ULASJ1234+0907 we have also performed narrow-band imag-
ing observations using the ISAAC (Infrared Spectrometer And Ar-
ray Camera) camera on the VLT (Moorwood et al. 1998). We used
a narrow-band ﬁlter at 2.29 µm corresponding to the observed
wavelength of Hα in this quasar. Observations were carried out
in 2013 March. The ISAAC ﬁeld of view is 2.5×2.5 arcmin and
the pixel scale is 0.148 arcsec per pixel. ULASJ1234+0907 is the
most extreme object in our sample. With (J − K)=5.3 (Vega), it
is by far the reddest quasar currently known and the reddest near
infra-red luminous source in the extragalactic sky. The host galaxy
of the rapidly accreting black-hole is a hyperluminous starburst
with an enormous star formation rate conservatively estimated to be
∼2000M⊙yr−1 (Banerji et al. 2014). The objective of the narrow-
band observations was therefore to detect extended Hα emission
associated with star formation in the quasar host galaxy. A broad
K-band continuum image was also taken using ISAAC to allow
calibration of the narrow-band image and subtraction of contin-
uum emission from any narrow-band detected sources. The narrow-
band observations were split into two Observing Blocks (OBs) for
ease of scheduling. Each OB consisted of seven dithered exposures
of 4×75s each resulting in a total integration time of 70 minutes
across the two OBs. The KS-band observations were taken using
15 dithered exposures of 6×10s each resulting in a total integration
time of 15 minutes. All observations were carried out under photo-
metric conditions and in very good seeing of <0.5 arcsec in order
to be able to spatially resolve kiloparsec scale structures associated
with extended star formation in the quasar host.

The data was reduced using standard ESO tools provided as
part of the gasgano package. Data reduction steps included dark
subtraction, ﬂat-ﬁelding and co-addition of the individual expo-
sures to produce the combined images. Images were registered onto
the World Coordinate System (WCS) using the positions of known

2MASS stars in the ﬁeld. Flux calibration was performed using
standard stars observed in the KS ﬁlter on the same night. The me-
dian KS band zero-point derived from these observations is 24.16.
We applied an offset of 1.9 mags (Retzlaff et al. 2010) in KS to
convert the magnitudes to the AB system. The relative throughput
between the broad and narrow-band ﬁlters was determined using
a single 2MASS star in our ﬁeld. Due to the lack of other bright
objects in the ﬁeld, this ﬂux calibration is expected to be accurate
at the level of 0.1 mags. As the two narrow-band OBs were exe-
cuted on different nights, we reduced each of these separately to
produce two co-added narrow-band images. After ensuring that the
photometry and astrometry were consistent between the two im-
ages, the two reduced narrow-band images were then combined to
produce our ﬁnal narrow-band image.

The measured FWHM of the quasar in the KS-band is
0.41 arcsec which is consistent with the size of the seeing disk
of the ISAAC observations. The FWHM of the quasar in the two
narrow-band images is 0.43 arcsec and 0.51 arcsec once again con-
sistent with the seeing of the ISAAC observations.

The quasar appears to be unresolved in both the broad and
narrow-band observations. In order to search for faint extended Hα
emission, we attempted to perform PSF subtraction on the quasar
image using the single bright star in the ﬁeld. The star was sub-
tracted from the quasar images after scaling the ﬂux of the star to
match that of the quasar. Although some residuals remained due
to imperfect subtraction, the PSF subtracted images are consistent
with noise and we do not ﬁnd any evidence for obvious extended
Hα emission around the quasar.

In order to derive the noise on the Hα images, we extracted
a region of 256×256 pixels around the quasar in which there are
no other bright sources. The quasar broad-line emission was then
masked from the images by removing all pixels above 5σ which
are all located within the seeing disk of the image. The remaining
pixels were then used to calculate the RMS noise properties of the
narrow-band images. The RMS noise is 0.10 µJy per pixel in the
combined narrow-band image which translates to an Hα ﬂux of
1.7×10−18 erg/s/cm2 per pixel.
We subtract the broad-line Hα emission from our narrow-band
image such that we are only sensitive to extended star formation
at radii outside the seeing FWHM (∼1 arcsec from the quasar nu-
cleus). This corresponds to physical scales of &8 kpc at z = 2.503.
At scales of >8 kpc from the quasar, our narrow-band imaging al-
lows us to place limits on the star formation rate density (converting
Hα ﬂux to a star formation rate using Kennicutt & Evans (2012))
of ΣSFR <3 M⊙yr−1 per pixel or < 2 M⊙yr−1kpc−2 (3σ). In
Fig. A1 we show the star formation rate density map in a box
of 6×6 arcsec around ULASJ1234+0907. The nuclear source has
been masked out from the image.
The total star formation taking place in ULASJ1234+0907
has been constrained as ∼2000 M⊙yr−1 from far infra-red obser-
vations (Banerji et al. 2014), enabling a comparison to the lim-
its on the level of unobscured star formation derived from our
Hα narrow-band imaging. Given the extreme starburst luminos-
ity of ULASJ1234+0907 and even accounting for a dust-extinction
of AV = 6 mags as measured towards the central black-hole
(Banerji et al. 2012), the Hα ﬂux due to star formation is expected
to be 3.4×10−17 erg/s/cm2. This is a lower limit given that the ex-
tinction may be less severe towards the star-forming regions. As-
suming this star formation is occurring over a region of ∼6 kpc or
0.75 arcsec consistent with observations of SMGs (Swinbank et al.
2006; Alaghband-Zadeh et al. 2012; Men´endez-Delmestre et al.
2013), this means that the Hα ﬂux per pixel due to star forma-

Figure A1. Narrow-band Hα emission map in a region of 6×6 arcsec
around ULASJ1234+0907 where the Hα emission per pixel has been
converted to a star formation rate density per pixel. The pixel size is
0.148 arcsec. The image has been smoothed using median ﬁltering over a
2×2 pixel box. The 1σ contours can also be seen. From this map, we ob-
tain a 1σ limit on the star formation rate density of ΣSFR <1 M⊙yr−1 per
pixel

tion is expected to be ∼7×10−18 erg/s/cm2. The noise in our co-
added narrow-band image is 1.7×10−18 erg/s/cm2 per pixel so we
should have detected this star formation at the ∼4σ level if it was
occurring at radii >8 kpc from the central black-hole. We conclude
therefore that the starburst in ULASJ1234+0907 is located within
∼8 kpc of the central black-hole. In Section 3.3 we ﬁnd that any star
formation within the PSF (<6.1 kpc) must have a star formation
rate <4600 M⊙yr−1. These results are therefore consistent with the
ﬁndings of the narrow band imaging that the star formation must be
contained within the central 8 kpc.

APPENDIX B: ULASJ1002+0137

Using the same Hα data, Cresci et al. (2015) highlight two re-
gions (at 9σ and 4σ signiﬁcance levels) of narrow Hα emission
in ULASJ1002+0137 from which they measure a combined Hα
star formation rate of ∼230 M⊙/yr, consistent with the star forma-
tion rate of ∼275 M⊙/yr constrained from far-infrared observations
(Brusa et al. 2014). The narrow Hα proﬁle of ULASJ1002+0137
presented in both Bongiorno et al. (2014) and Cresci et al. (2015)
is present in our integrated spectrum (see Paper I). A strong sky-
emission line is coincident with the narrow Hα emission. Using
our noise-weighted, broad proﬁle-subtracting, detection scheme we
detect a smaller narrow Hα signal with a star formation rate of
47±9 M⊙/yr found to lie in a region of ∼11 kpc around the quasar
centre. Owing to the 0.8′′ seeing of the observations we do not at-
tempt to undertake a spatially resolved analysis of this object. We
note that our procedure is tailored for use on multiple objects with
no prior information available about the shape of both the broad
and narrow Hα lines.

Figure C1. Left: Map of the narrow Hα emission in ULASJ1002+0137, created by integrating the proﬁle-subtracted cube from the centre of the narrow line
±150 kms−1 (1.5σ). The proﬁle-subtracted cube is made by subtracting the broad line proﬁle (scaled using the maximum likelihood technique) from the
spectrum in each binned spaxel. Since we ﬁnd evidence for extended (spatially resolved) narrow Hα emission in this case the spaxels are binned such that
each spaxel represents the sum of the surrounding spaxels in a region the size of which maximises the S/N of the detection. The black cross marks the quasar
centre and corresponds to the aperture in which the total spectrum has evidence for a narrow Gaussian of width σ=100 kms−1. We show the FWHM of the
PSF-aperture by the black line in the bottom, right-hand corner. Top Right: The total spectrum from the aperture at the quasar centre with the scaled Gaussian
overlayed. Bottom Right: The noise spectrum (as detailed in Section 2.1).

Figure C2. As for C1 for the narrow Hα emission in VHSJ1556-0835. Since the narrow Hα emission is spatially unresolved the spaxels are binned such that
each spaxel represents the sum of the surrounding spaxels in a region the size of PSF-aperture. The black cross marks the quasar centre and corresponds to the
PSF-aperture in which the total spectrum has evidence for a narrow Gaussian of width σ=100 kms−1. We show the FWHM of the PSF-aperture by the black
line in the bottom, right-hand corner.
