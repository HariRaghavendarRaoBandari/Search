Abstract

In this paper we prove the conjecture of Alexander and Currier that states, except for
covering maps of equidistant surfaces in hyperbolic 3-space, a complete, nonnegatively
curved immersed hypersurface in hyperbolic space is necessarily properly embedded.

1 Introduction

Suppose that φ : M n → Rn+1 is an immersed hypersurface with principal curvatures κ1, . . . , κn.
Then φ is said to be

• convex at a point if κi ≥ 0 for all i = 1, . . . , n.

• of nonnegative Ricci curvature if κi(Pn

• nonnegatively curved if κiκj ≥ 0 for all i, j = 1, . . . , n.

k=1 κk) ≥ κ2

i for all i = 1, . . . , n.

It is easily seen that up to orientation all three of the above curvature conditions are point-
wise equivalent for hypersurfaces immersed in Euclidean space. An immersed hypersurface in
Euclidean space is said to be locally convex if the hypersurface is locally supported by a hyper-
plane. It is not true that nonnegativity of the sectional curvatures alone implies local convexity
of a hypersurface (cf. [18]).

The study of nonnegatively curved immersed hypersurfaces goes back to Hadamard, who
showed that a compact, strictly convex, immersed surface in Euclidean 3-space is necessarily
embedded [16]. This was later extended in [23, 25, 9, 18] to such that a complete, nonnega-
tively curved, nonﬂat, immersed hypersurface in Euclidean space is necessarily embedded as a
boundary of convex body.

In this paper we consider oriented immersed hypersurfaces φ : M n → Hn+1 in hyperbolic

space. The following pointwise curvature conditions are no longer equivalent:

• convex at a point if κi ≥ 0 for all i = 1, . . . , n.

• nonnegative Ricci curvature if κi(Pn

• nonnegatively curved if κiκj ≥ 1 for all i, j = 1, . . . , n.

k=1 κk) ≥ n − 1 + κ2

i for all i = 1, . . . , n.

• (non-strictly) horospherically convex if κi ≥ 1 for all i = 1, . . . , n.

In fact, they are in strictly ascending order as listed above (cf. [1, 2]). Do Carmo and Warner
[11] showed that a compact, convex, immersed hypersurface in hyperbolic space is necessarily
embedded. For noncompact cases, even with strict convexity, a complete, immersed hypersur-
face in hyperbolic space may not be embedded [13] (see also [22], pg. 84). On the other hand,
Currier [10] showed that a (non-strictly) horospherically convex, complete, immersed hypersur-
face in hyperbolic space is necessarily embedded and, if noncompact, a horosphere. Therefore
one wonders whether a complete immersed hypersurface with nonnegative sectional or even
nonnegative Ricci curvature is necessarily embedded?

Naturally the embeddedness problem for a complete noncompact hypersurface in hyperbolic
space is related to its asymptotic boundary at inﬁnity. The asymptotic boundaries at inﬁnity of
complete hypersurfaces with nonnegative curvature in hyperbolic space have been studied in
[13, 1, 2]. In [1], based on a theorem of Volkov and Vladimirova [26] and the splitting theo-
rem of Cheeger and Gromoll [8], Alexander and Currier showed that a complete, nonnegatively
curved, embedded hypersurface in hyperbolic space has an asymptotic boundary at inﬁnity of
at most two points and, if two points, it is an equidistant surface about a geodesic line (see also
[2]). Interestingly, in [13], Epstein showed that a complete, strictly convex, immersed surface
in H3 with its asymptotic boundary at inﬁnity of one single point is necessarily embedded as
an extension of van Heijenoort’s theorem [25]. Based on the studies in [13, 1, 2], Alexander
and Currier [2] stated that an appropriate conjecture would be: Except for covering maps of
equidistant surfaces in H3, every nonnegatively curved immersed hypersurface in Hn+1 is a
proper embedding. They also mentioned a sketch of a proof of this conjecture for higher di-
mensions (n ≥ 3) suggested by Gromov. Their conjecture remains completely open in the case
when n = 2 (cf. [2]).

In this paper we present proofs of the conjecture of Alexander and Currier for the case when

n = 2 as well as all higher dimensions (n ≥ 3). Our main theorem is as follows:

Main Theorem. Except for covering maps of equidistant surfaces in H3, a complete, non-
negatively curved, immersed hypersurface in hyperbolic space Hn+1 for n ≥ 2 is properly
embedded.

Our approach for solving the conjecture of Alexander and Currier in higher dimensions
(n ≥ 3) is based on the recent work [4] on the weakly horospherically convex hypersurfaces
(cf. Deﬁnition 2.2) in hyperbolic space, which may be considered as an extension of the em-
bedding theorem in [13]. Please see Theorem 2.2 and Theorem 2.3 in Section 2.

An oriented, immersed hypersurface φ : M n → Hn+1 ⊂ R1,n+1 in hyperbolic space with

principal curvatures κi in the curvature directions ei is said to be

• weakly horospherically convex if κi > −1 for all i = 1, . . . , n (cf. Deﬁnition 2.2 and

Lemma 2.1) and

• uniformly weakly horospherically convex if κi ≥ κ0 > −1 for some κ0 and all i =

1, . . . n (cf. [4]).

The choice of the words “weakly horospherically convex” was mostly due to the lack of any
better ones but this terminology seems beﬁtting to our discussion. We could continue to use
“horospherically concave” as in [4], but we think that is perhaps more appropriate for a choice
of an orientation such that all principal curvatures are less than 1.

Let η : M n → S1,n ⊂ R1,n+1 be the unit normal vector to φ and let

ψ = φ − η = eρ(1, G) : M n → Nn+1

+ ⊂ R1,n+1

be the so-called light cone map for φ, where ρ : M n → R is the signed hyperbolic distance of
the supporting horosphere to the vertex of Hn+1 and G : M n → Sn is the hyperbolic Gauss
map. The hyperbolic Gauss map G is a local diffeomorphism and gives rise to the so-called
horospherical metric

gh = e2ρG∗gSn

when φ is weakly horospherically convex. Horospherical metrics are locally conformally ﬂat
by deﬁnition and the Gauss map is naturally a development map from (M n, gh) when n ≥ 3.
The geometry of the horospherical metric gh is found to be intimately tied to the geometry of
the hypersurface φ (cf. [13, 15, 3, 4]). Namely, one may calculate the sectional curvature of gh
in the plane σij generated by ei and ej to ﬁnd

Kgh(σij) = 1 −

simply by

Schgh(ei, ej) = (

In the case when n = 2, the Schouten tensor is replaced by the following symmetric 2-tensor

(1.1)

Based on the embedding Theorem 2.2 in Section 2 (please also see [4]), we will present a
proof of the conjecture of Alexander and Currier [2] in higher dimensions (n ≥ 3) using the
injectivity of development maps of Schoen and Yau [20, 21], the Hausdorff dimension estimates
of Zhu [27], and the rigidity result of Alexander and Currier [1, 2] for complete, nonnegatively
curved, embedded hypersurfaces with the asymptotic boundary at inﬁnity of exactly two points.
An extension of the embedding theorem of Epstein [13] in higher dimensions (n ≥ 3) solves the
cases where the asymptotic boundary at inﬁnity is exactly a single point (please see Theorem
2.3 in Section 2).

To prove the conjecture of Alexander and Currier [2] in the case when n = 2, we ﬁrst es-
tablish a new proof of the classical result of Volkov and Vladimirova [26], which states that the
only way to isometrically immerse the Euclidean plane R2 in H3 is as a covering map of an
equidistant surface about a geodesic line or as a horosphere. Our proof is based on the confor-
mal property of the 2-tensor P associated with the horospherical metric and the sharp growth
estimate (4.8) in Lemma 4.2 for solutions to Gauss curvature equations based on [17, 24]. Our
approach in principle is to show that a complete, noncompact, nonnegatively curved, nonﬂat,
immersed surface in H3 lies inside a horosphere, hence has an asymptotic boundary at inﬁnity
of exactly one point. Then the embeddedness follows from the embedding theorem of Epstein
[13].

This paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we introduce the geometry of horospherical
metrics for weakly horospherically convex hypersurfaces in hyperbolic space and some frame-
work from [15, 3, 4]. In Section 3, we apply the embedding Theorems 2.2 and 2.3 (see also [4])
to prove the conjecture of Alexander and Currier [2] in higher dimensions (n ≥ 3). In Section
4 we present the proof of the conjecture of Alexander and Currier [2] in the case when n = 2.

2 Hyperbolic Gauss Maps and Horospherical Metrics

In this section we recall the deﬁnitions of hyperbolic Gauss maps and weak horospherical con-
vexity to set the terminologies and notations. Readers are referred to the papers [12, 14, 15, 3, 4]

for more details.

For n ≥ 2, we denote Minkowski spacetime by R1,n+1, which is the vector space Rn+2

endowed with the Minkowski spacetime metric h, i given by

h¯x, ¯xi = −x2

0 +

n+1Xi=1

x2
i ,

where ¯x ≡ (x0, x1, . . . , xn+1) ∈ Rn+2. Then hyperbolic space, de Sitter space, and the positive
null cone are given by the respective hyperquadrics

Hn+1 =(cid:8)¯x ∈ R1,n+1 : h¯x, ¯xi = −1, x0 > 0(cid:9) ,
S1,n =(cid:8)¯x ∈ R1,n+1 : h¯x, ¯xi = 1(cid:9) ,
+ =(cid:8)¯x ∈ R1,n+1 : h¯x, ¯xi = 0, x0 > 0(cid:9) .

Nn+1

We identify the ideal boundary at inﬁnity ∂∞Hn+1 of hyperbolic space with the unit round
sphere Sn sitting at x0 = 1.
Deﬁnition 2.1 (cf. [5, 12, 14]). Let φ : M n → Hn+1 denote an immersed oriented hypersurface
in Hn+1 with unit normal η : M n → S1,n. The hyperbolic Gauss map

G : M n → Sn

of φ is deﬁned as follows: for p ∈ M n, the image G(p) ∈ Sn is the point at inﬁnity of the unique
horosphere in Hn+1 passing through φ(p) and whose outward unit normal at φ(p) agrees with
η(p).

Given an oriented, immersed hypersurface φ : M n → Hn+1 with unit normal vector ﬁeld

η : M n → S1,n, the light cone map ψ associated to φ is deﬁned by

ψ := φ − η : M n → Nn+1
+ .

As the ideal boundary Sn of Hn+1 is identiﬁed with the unit round sphere at x0 = 1, we have

ψ = eρ(1, G),

(2.1)

where ψ0 = eρ is the so-called horospherical support function of the hypersurface φ [15].
Note that, in our convention given in Deﬁnition 2.1, horospheres with outward orientation
are the unique surfaces such that both the hyperbolic Gauss map and the associated light
cone map are constant. Moreover, if x ∈ Sn is the point at inﬁnity of such a horosphere,
then ψ = eρ(1, x) where ρ is the signed hyperbolic distance of the horosphere to the point
O = (1, 0, . . . , 0) ∈ Hn+1 ⊆ R1,n+1.

Considering the fact that horospheres are intrinsically ﬂat, one can then use horospheres to

deﬁne concavity/convexity for hypersurfaces in hyperbolic space.

5

Deﬁnition 2.2 (cf. [19, 15, 4]). Let φ : M n → Hn+1 be an immersed oriented hypersurface
and let Hp denote the horosphere in Hn+1 that is tangent to φ(M) at φ(p) whose outward unit
normal at φ(p) agrees with η(p). We will say that φ is weakly horospherically convex at p if
there exists a neighborhood V ⊂ M n of p so that φ(V \{p}) stays outside of Hp. Moreover, the
distance function of the hypersurface to the horosphere does not vanish up to the second order
at p in any direction.

Due to [15], we have the following characterization of weakly horospherically convex hy-

persurfaces.
Lemma 2.1 ([15]). Let φ : M n → Hn+1 be an immersed oriented hypersurface. Then φ is
weakly horospherically convex at p if and only if the principal curvatures κ1, . . . , κn of φ at p
are simultaneously > −1. In particular, φ is weakly horospherically convex at p implies that
dG is invertible at p and therefore the hyperbolic Gauss map of φ is a local diffeomorphism.

To realize this second statement, let {e1, . . . , en} denote an orthonormal basis of principal
directions of φ at p and let κ1, . . . , κn denote the associated principal curvatures. Then dφ(ei) =
ei and dη(ei) = −κiei for i = 1, . . . , n, so as in [15], it follows that

h(dψ)p(ei), (dψ)p(ej)iR1,n+1 = (1 + κi)2δij = e2ρh(dG)p(ei), (dG)p(ej)iSn,

(2.2)

where gSn denotes the round metric on Sn. Now given an immersed oriented weakly horospher-
ically convex hypersurface φ : M n → Hn+1, one can use the hyperbolic Gauss map (or light
cone map) to induce a canonical locally conformally ﬂat metric on M n as follows:
Deﬁnition 2.3 ([13, 14, 15]). Let φ : M n → Hn+1 be an immersed oriented weakly horo-
spherically convex hypersurface. Then the hyperbolic Gauss map G : M n → Sn is a local
diffeomorphism. We consider the locally conformally ﬂat metric

gh = Ψ∗h, iLn+2 = e2ρG∗gSn

(2.3)

on M n and call it the horospherical metric associated to the immersed oriented weakly horo-
spherically convex hypersurface φ.

For a weakly horospherically convex hypersurface φ, its associated light cone map Ψ is
spacelike and parameterizes a codimension 2 submanifold in R1,n+1. φ and η provide two unit
normal ﬁelds to Ψ and the second fundamental form is given by

IIΨ(ei, ej) = (

1 + κi

φ −

κi

1 + κi

η)gh(ei, ej)

(2.4)

where {e1, . . . , en} is an orthonormal basis of principal directions with respect to φ. Hence, due
to the Gauss equations in R1,n+1, the sectional curvatures of the horospherical metric gh on M n
are given by

Kgh(

When n ≥ 3, the Schouten tensor then is given by

Schgh(ei, ej) = (

When n = 2, instead, one considers the symmetric 2-tensor

whose trace is the Gaussian curvature

and whose divergence is 2dKgh. Hence we get the Gauss curvature equation

−∆G∗gS2 ρ + 1 = Kghe2ρ.

(2.6)

(2.7)

(2.8)

(2.9)

(2.10)

When the hyperbolic Gauss map G : M n → Sn of a weakly horospherically convex hyper-
surface φ : M n → Hn+1 is injective, one may push down the horospherical metric gh onto the
image

to obtain the conformal metric

Ω = G(M) ⊂ Sn

ˆgh = (G−1)∗gh = e2ˆρgSn,

(2.11)

(2.12)

where ˆρ = ρ ◦ G−1 : Ω → R. When there is no confusion, we will also refer to this conformal
metric ˆgh as the horospherical metric. The correspondence between weakly horospherically
convex hypersurfaces φ : M n → Hn+1 in hyperbolic space and the conformal metric ˆgh on the
image Ω of the Gauss map G have been promoted in [13, 15, 3, 4]. The following result follows
from the so-called global correspondence from [4, 15] and will be useful to our work here.

Theorem 2.1 (cf. [4, 15]). For n ≥ 2, let φ : M n → Hn+1 be a complete uniformly weakly
horospherically convex hypersurface with injective hyperbolic Gauss map G : M n → Sn. Then

• φ induces a complete conformal metric ˆgh = e2ˆρgSn on the image Ω = G(M) ⊂ Sn with

bounded curvature.

• More importantly, when n ≥ 3, the asymptotic boundary ∂∞φ(M n) ⊂ Sn at inﬁnity of the
hypersurface φ in Hn+1 coincides with the boundary ∂Ω ⊂ Sn of the Gauss map image.

7

• One may use the image Ω of Gauss map as the parameter space to reparametrize φ so

that the Gauss map

G(x) = x : Ω → Sn

and

φt =

eρ+t

2

(1 + e−2(ρ+t)(1 + |∇ρ|2))(1, x) + e−(ρ+t)(0, −x + ∇ρ)

(2.13)

is the nornal ﬂow of the hypersurface φ(M n).

The contribution of [3] is the use of the normal ﬂow of a weakly horospherically convex
hypersurface with injective hyperbolic Gauss map to possibly unfold the hypersurface into an
embedded one. This is because the leaves of regular part of the normal ﬂow are the same as the
level surfaces of the geodesic deﬁning function of the horospherical metric ˆgh (cf. [3, 4]). For
instance, it is observed in [3] that any horospherical ovaloid can be deformed along its normal
ﬂow into an embedded one. Consequently this leads to new proofs of Obata type theorems for
horospherical ovaloids. In [4], based on the global correspondence theorem, we established an
extension of the embedding theorem of Epstein [13] as follows:

Theorem 2.2. (cf. [4]) For n ≥ 2, let φ : M n → Hn+1 be a complete uniformly weakly
horospherically convex hypersurface with injective hyperbolic Gauss map G : M n → Sn.
Suppose that the asymptotic boundary ∂∞φ(M n) at inﬁnity of the hypersurface is a disjoint
union of smooth closed submanifolds in Sn. Then, along the normal ﬂow from the hypersurface,
the leaves eventually become embedded.

An argument similar to those in [25, 13] results in the following slight extension of the

embedding theorem of Epstein [13].

Theorem 2.3. For n ≥ 2, let φ : M n → Hn+1 be a complete, locally strictly convex, immersed
hypersurface. Suppose that the asymptotic boundary ∂∞φ(M n) at inﬁnity of the hypersurface
is a single point in Sn. Then the hypersurface is in fact embedded.

Proof. For convenience of readers, we would like to present a proof based on the arguments
in [25, 13], which are similar to those in [4]. Since the asymptotic boundary at inﬁnity of
the hypersurface is a single point in Sn, one may ﬁnd a family of round (n − 1)-spheres in
Sn to foliate the sphere Sn with the point and its antipodal point deleted. Then the family of
hyperplanes whose asymptotic boundary at inﬁnity are the family of round (n − 1)-spheres
foliates hyperbolic space. To ﬁnish the argument one simply needs to observe that, close to
the ﬁrst touch point of the hyperplanes and the hypersurfaces from the antipodal point, the
hypersurface is locally embedded and the intersections of the hyperplanes and hypersurfaces are
embedded convex topological spheres. Moreover, everything remains the same up to the end.
The connectedness and convexity of the hypersurface force each intersection to be connected
and convex. The embeddedness of the intersections is due to [11].

3 Embeddedness in Higher Dimensions

In this section we consider noncompact hypersurfaces immersed in hyperbolic space with non-
negative sectional curvature and present a proof for the conjecture of Alexander and Currier [2]
in higher dimensions (n ≥ 3). Based on the injectivity of development maps of Schoen and
Yau [20, 21] and the Hausforff dimension estimates of Zhu [27], the proof of the conjecture
of Alexander and Currier [2] is rather straightforward following our work in [4] and the brief
summary in the previous section.

First of all, from the curvature relations (2.5), we have:

Lemma 3.1. Suppose that φ : M n → Hn+1 is a nonnegatively curved immersed hypersurface.
Then φ is weakly horospherically convex and the horospherical metric is also nonnegatively
curved.

Proof. It is easily seen that a nonnegatively curved hypersurface in hyperbolic space is weakly
horospherically convex, in fact, it is strictly convex. Then the lemma is a simple consequence
of (2.5).

There does not seem to be any analog of Lemma 3.1 available if we consider nonnegative
Ricci curvature for the hypersurface φ instead. In higher dimensions (n ≥ 3), using the works
in [20, 21, 27], we obtain the following:
Lemma 3.2. For n ≥ 3, let φ : M n → Hn+1 be a complete, nonnegatively curved, immersed
hypersurface. Then the hyperbolic Gauss map is a development map from (M n, gh) and injec-
tive. Moreover, the Hausdorff dimension of ∂G(M n) = Sn\G(M n) is zero.

Proof. Due to the uniform weak horospherical convexity (strict convexity) of the hypersurface
φ, the completeness of the hypersurface implies the completeness of the horospherical metric gh.
In the light of Lemma 3.1, (M n, gh) is a complete, nonnegatively curved Riemannian manifold.
Therefore the lemma follows from the injectivity theorem of Schoen and Yau in [20, 21] and
the Hausdorff dimension estimates of Zhu in [27]. Notice that the theorem of Schoen and Yau
only needs gh to have nonnegative scalar curvature, and the Hausdorff estimates of Zhu only
need gh to be Ricci nonnegative.

One more ingredient for our proof of the conjecture of Alexander and Currier [2] in higher

dimensions (n ≥ 3) is the following:
Lemma 3.3. Suppose that φ : M n → Hn+1 is a weakly horospherically convex immersed
hypersurface. Then, along the normal ﬂow (2.13), the hypersurface remains nonnegatively
curved.

9

Proof. For the normal ﬂow (2.13) in hyperbolic space, one knows exactly how the principal
curvatures evolve:

(3.1)

κt
i =

κi + tanh t
1 + κi tanh t
ij = κt

.

One may then calculate the sectional curvatures K t

iκt

j − 1 for t > 0 to ﬁnd

K t

ij = κt

iκt

j − 1 =

Kij(1 − tanh2 t)

(1 + κ1 tanh t)(1 + κ2 tanh t)

≥ 0,

(3.2)

where Kij are the sectional curvatures of φ.

We are now ready to prove the conjecture of Alexander and Currier [2] in higher dimensions

(n ≥ 3).

For n ≥ 3, let φ : M n → Hn+1 be an im-
Proof. (Main Theorem in higher dimensions)
mersed, complete, noncompact hypersurface with nonnegative sectional curvature. In the light
of Lemma 3.2 the hyperbolic Gauss map G : M → Sn is injective and the Hausdorff dimension
of ∂G(M n) ⊂ Sn is zero. According to Theorem 2.1 (cf. [4]), we have

∂∞φ(M n) = ∂G(M n).

Now, if ∂∞φ(M n) = ∂G(M n) were empty, then φ(M n) would be compact. Moreover, since
any set of Hausdorff dimension zero is totally disconnected, due to the splitting theorem of
Cheeger and Gromoll [8], the asymptotic boundary ∂∞φ(M n) = ∂G(M n) consists of either
one single point or exactly two points.

When ∂∞φ(M n) is a single point, the result follows from Theorem 2.3. Assume ∂∞φ(M n)
consists of exactly two points. We then ﬁrst apply Theorem 2.2 (please also see [4]) and ob-
serve that along the normal ﬂow the nonnegatively curved hypersurface φt is embedded for
sufﬁciently large t. Notice that the nonnegativity of the sectional curvatures of φt follows from
Lemma 3.3. Therefore, by the rigidity result of Alexander and Currier [1, 2], for t sufﬁciently
large the hypersurface φt has to be an equidistant hypersurface about a geodesic line in hy-
perbolic space. This forces the hypersurface φ to be an equidistant hypersurface in hyperbolic
space. Thus the prooof for the conjecture of Alexander and Currier [2] in higher dimensions
(n ≥ 3) is complete.

4 Embeddedness of Nonnegatively Curved Surfaces

In this ﬁnal section we consider noncompact surfaces immersed in H3 with nonnegative Gaus-
sian curvature and we present a proof of the conjecture of Alexander and Currier [2] in dimen-
sion n = 2.

10

Suppose that φ : M 2 → H3 is a complete, nonnegatively curved immersed surface. We may
assume the surface is locally strictly convex after a change of orientation, if necessary. There-
fore the hyperbolic Gauss map G : M 2 → S2 is a local diffeomorphism, and the horospherical
metric gh is complete (cf. Theorem 2.1) and nonnegatively curved in the light of (2.9). In fact,
the symmetric tensor P associated with the horosphericl metric gh satisﬁes

−

1
2

gh < P <

gh

(4.1)

according to (2.8). With the complex structure given by the horospherical metric gh the Gauss
map G indeed is a conformal map into Riemann sphere. Lemma 3.2 breaks down in dimension
2 because of the abundance of local holomorphic functions (the lack of Liouville Theorem).
The search for a type of Picard theorem for holomorphic functions analogous to Lemma 3.2
in dimension 2 is technically much more difﬁcult, though it seems to be a classic topic. We
are going to rely on the growth estimate (4.8) in Lemma 4.2 based on [17, 24] for the support
function ρ as a solution to the Gauss curvature equation (2.10). The novelty of our approach is
to recognize that nonﬂatness implies that the asymptotic boundary at inﬁnity consists of exactly
one point and embeddedness then follows directly from the embedding theorem of Epstein [13]
as a hyperbolic analog of the embedding theorem of van Heijenoort [25].

Let π : fM 2 → M 2 be the universal covering map. Then we consider the new parametriza-
tion ˜φ = φ ◦ π : fM 2 → H3 with the hyperbolic Gauss map ˜G = G ◦ π : fM 2 → S2 and

the horospherical metric ˜gh = π∗gh whose Gaussian curvature K˜gh = Kgh ◦ π ≥ 0. Most
importantly we have the symmetric tensor

˜P = P ◦ π = −Dd˜ρ + d˜ρ ⊗ d˜ρ −

(|d˜ρ|2 − 1) ˜G∗gS2,

1
2

where ˜ρ = ρ ◦ π and

˜gh < ˜P <

˜gh.

(4.2)

It follows from Theorem 15 in [17] of Huber that (M 2, gh) is parabolic when the surface φ is

nonnegatively curved. Therefore the universal coverfM 2 of M 2 is biholomorphic to the complex

plane C.

4.1 Flat Cases

In this subsection we present a proof to the following theorem of Volkov and Vladimirova [26].
Our proof will provide an opportunity for us to examine what is crucially different when the
surface is nonnegatively curved and nonﬂat.

Theorem 4.1 ([26]). Let φ be an isometric immersion from Euclidean plane to hyperbolic 3-
space. Then φ is either a covering map of an equidistant surface about a geodesic line in H3 or
it is an embedded horosphere.

Proof. First of all it follows from (2.9) that Kgh ≡ 0 whenever Kφ ≡ 0. Therefore (R2, gh)
is isometric to the Euclidean plane. Let z = (x, y) be the Euclidean coordinate for (R2, gh) so
that gh = |dz|2. From the properties of the tensor P , we know that P is a symmetric 2-tensor,
which is trace-free, divergence-free and bounded in the sense that

−

|dz|2 < P <

|dz|2.

Thus P is in fact constant since P induces a bounded holomorphic function on C.

By rewriting the deﬁnition of the horospherical metric we now have

G∗gS2 = e−2ρ|dz|2.

One may calculate the tensor P = P11dx2 + 2P12dxdy + P22dy2 from (1.1) to ﬁnd

P21 P22 (cid:19) =(cid:18) −ρxx − 1

Therefore we arrive at the following equations from the fact that P is constant:

for q(x, y) = eρ(x,y) and some constants C1 and C2. It is clear in the following that (C1, C2) =
(0, 0) corresponds to horospheres while otherwise it corresponds to equidistant surfaces. In fact
we will ﬁnd all positive solutions of (4.4) deﬁned on the entire plane R2.

CASE 1: (C1, C2) = (0, 0):
In this case P = 0 and all principal curvatures are identically
one. Hence this is the case where the surface is a horosphere. Let us solve (4.4). From the
second equation in (4.4) it follows that

for some function F (x) and G(y). Then, from the ﬁrst equation in (4.4), we conclude that

q(x, y) = F (x) + G(y)

q(x, y) = C[(x − x0)2 + (y − y0)2] + A

12

for some constants C > 0, A > 0, due to the separation of variables. Finally, from the third
equation in (4.4) at (x0, y0), we get 4AC = 1. Thus

q(x, y) = C[(x − x0)2 + (y − y0)2] +

and

ρ(x, y) = log(C[(x − x0)2 + (y − y0)2] +

for some positive constant C.

(4.5)

CASE 2: (C1, C2) 6= (0, 0):
In this case we may assume that C1 > 0 and C2 = 0 after a
rotation, if necessary. That is to say P is a constant and diagonal. Then the surface has two
constant principal curvatures and is a so-called isoparametric surface. Therefore the surface is
an equidistant surface from a geodesic line in H3 by the classiﬁcation of isoparametric surfaces
(cf. for example, [6, 7, 26]). Again let us solve (4.4) in these cases too. Due to the separation
of variables, we have

√C1x + B1e−√C1x + A2 cos(pC1y) + B2 sin(pC1y))

with A1, B1, C1 > 0. The covering property is clearly seen from

ρ(x, y) = log(A1e

4.2 Nonﬂat Cases

In this subsection we consider a complete, noncompact, nonnegatively curved, nonﬂat, im-
mersed surface φ : M 2 → H3. We will focus on how to recognize and use the nonﬂatness.
Continuing from the discussions before the subsection above, from Huber’s result [17], we

know the universal cover (fM 2, ˜gh) is globally conformal to the Euclidean plane . Let z = (x, y)
be the Euclidean coordinate for fM 2 so that

˜gh = e2˜ρ0|dz|2 = e2˜ρ ˜G∗gS2.

Rewrite the relation above as

and consider the symmetric 2-tensor

|dz|2 = e2(˜ρ−˜ρ0) ˜G∗gS2 = e2ρ0 ˜G∗gS2

P0 = −∇ ˜G∗gS2

dρ0 + dρ0 ⊗ dρ0 −

(|dρ0|2

− 1) ˜G∗gS2.

(4.7)

It is perhaps helpful to think that with the Gauss map ˜G and support function eρ0, P0 corresponds
to a surface in H3 as in Theorem 2.1. What is this surface? From the discussion in the ﬂat cases
we know that it is a horosphere if P0 vanishes. The following is a conformal property of the
symmetric 2-tensor P0, which is a simple calculation.

is the symmetric 2-tensor for the surface ˜φ.

The most important technical tool in this case is the following sharp growth estimates for
solutions to Gauss curvature equations based on [17, Theorem 10] and [24, Lemma 3]. We will
present the proof in the next subsection.
Lemma 4.2. Suppose that (R2, e2u|dz|2) is complete, noncompact, nonnegatively curved, and
nonﬂat. Then

u = −m logp1 + |z|2 + o(logp1 + |z|2) as |z| → ∞

(4.8)

for some m ∈ (0, 1].

We are now ready to prove that P0 vanishes.

Lemma 4.3. The symmetric 2-tensor P0 in (4.7) vanishes identically on R2 and ρ0 is given as
a solution in (4.5).

Proof. First of all, in the light of the calculations in Lemma 4.1, we know that P0 is a trace-free,
divergence-free, symmetric 2-tensor on R2, therefore it is constant if it is bounded. To show P0
is in fact identically zero one just needs to show P0 → 0 as |z| → ∞. Applying Lemma 4.2, we
get

˜ρ0 = −m logp1 + |z|2 + o(logp1 + |z|2)

as |z| → ∞

for some m ∈ (0, 1]. Then we know from (4.2) that

| ˜P | ≤ e2˜ρ0 → 0

as |z| → ∞.

This uses the fact that m > 0, which is a consequence of the fact that the surface is nonﬂat.
Also, by a direct calculation, we have

|∂2

xx ˜ρ0| + |∂2

xy ˜ρ0| + |∂2

yy ˜ρ0| + |∂x ˜ρ0|2 + |∂y ˜ρ0|2 ≤

C(m)

(1 + |z|2)

→ 0

as |z| → ∞.

We are now ready to complete the proof of the conjecture of Alexander and Currier [2] in

dimension 2.

Proof. (Main Theorem in dimension 2) As a consequence of Lemma 4.3, a surface that has
hyperbolic Gauss map ˜G and support function eρ0 is a horosphere. Therefore the Gauss map ˜G
is injective onto 2-sphere with one point deleted and the covering map π is injective. Hence the
Gauss map G is injective onto the 2-sphere with one point deleted.

Meanwhile, in the light of (4.5), we know

ρ = ˜ρ = ρ0 + ˜ρ0 = (2 − m) logp1 + |z|2 + o(logp1 + |z|2) → ∞ as |z| → ∞.

Thus we conclude that the asymptotic boundary of φ(M) consists of a single point and therefore
φ(M) is embedded by the embedding theorem of Epstein in [13].

4.3 Proof of the Key Analytic Lemma

In this subsection we prove the estimate (4.8) in Lemma 4.2. To begin, we ﬁrst state [24, Lemma
2] as follows:
Lemma 4.4 ([24, Lemma 2]). Let Ω be an open neighborhood of the origin in R2. Suppose that
v is harmonic in the punctured neighborhood Ω\{0}. If

Z|z|<ε

|v(x, y)|dxdy = o(ε) as ε → 0+,

then there is a constant β such that

v(x, y) − β log

1
|z|

(4.9)

has a harmonic extension to Ω.

Next we prove a variant of [24, Lemma 3] of Taliaferro for solutions to the Poisson equation

−∆u = f

(4.10)

in a domain in R2. The difference in the following Lemma 4.5 from [24, Lemma 3] is that
we do not assume the solutions to be nonnegative, instead we assume f to be nonnegative and
integrable.

15

Lemma 4.5. Let f : Ω\{0} → [0, +∞) be continuous and f ∈ L1
solution to (4.10) in Ω\{0}. Then u ∈ L1
function uh : ¯Br(0) ⊂ Ω → R such that

loc(Ω). Suppose u is a C 2
loc(Ω) and there exists a constant β and a harmonic

u = β log

|z|

+ uα + uh in Br(0)\{0}

where

Moreover, if

uα(z) =

|z − w|

)f (w)

1

2πZ|w|<r
Z r

exp(u(x, 0))dx

is inﬁnite, then β ≥ 1.

Proof. Averaging (4.10) and integrating the resulting ODE we get

(4.11)

(4.12)

(4.13)

r2¯u′(r2) = r1 ¯u′(r1) +

f (z) for 0 < r2 ≤ r1,

1

2πZr2<|z|<r1

where ¯u(r) = 1

2πrR∂Br(0) udθ. But then, since f ≥ 0 and f ∈ L1(Br(0)), it follows that

r¯u′(r) = −β + o(1) as r → 0+

for some β ∈ R (not necessarily nonnegative) so

¯u(r)
log 1
r

= β + o(1) as r → 0+.

This implies

Z|z|<ε

u =Z ε

0

2πr¯u(r)dr = O(ε2 log

1
ε

) as ε → 0+

and therefore u ∈ L1(Br1(0)).

Deﬁne uα : R2 → R by (4.12). Then, as in [24, Lemma 3], it follows that

Therefore,

¯uα(r) = o(log

1
r

) as r → 0+.

Z|x|<ε

|u − uα|dx ≤ O(ε2 log

1
ε

) as ε → 0+.

16

So by Lemma 4.4 (cf. [24, Lemma 2]), it follows that for some β′ ∈ R and some harmonic
function uh that we have

in Br(0)\{0}. It is clear that β′ = β.

u − uα − β′ log

1
r

= uh

At last, if β < 1, then we can choose β < β1 < 1 and r3 sufﬁciently small so that

But then

and

u < β1 log

for 0 < |z| < r3.

exp(u) < r−β1 for 0 < |z| < r3

Z r3

exp(u(x, 0))dx <Z r3

r−β1dr < ∞,

which by contraposition completes the proof.

When considering the Gauss curvature equations, the integrability of the right hand side
Ke2u comes from [17, Theorem 10], which is very signiﬁcant contribution even though the
geometric intuition is clear. For the convenience of readers, we recall this result.
Lemma 4.6 ([17, Theorem 10]). Suppose that g = e2u(x,y)(dx2 + dy2) is a conformal metric de-
ﬁned on Br(0)\{0} that is complete at the origin. If the Gaussian curvature Kg is nonnegative,
then Kge2u is integrable and

ZBr(0)

Kge2u ≤ 2π.

(4.14)

Now we are ready to prove the estimate (4.8) in Lemma 4.2.
|z|2 be the inversion map. Then

Let ˜z = z

Proof. (Lemma 4.2)

|dz|2 =

1
|˜z|4 |d˜z|2.

We use the inversion to take R2\B1(0) to B1(0)\{0}. Therefore

g = e2u|dz|2 = e2(u−2 log |˜z|)|d˜z|2.

For ˜u(˜z) = u( ˜z

|˜z|2 ) − 2 log |˜z|, we have

− ˜∆˜u = Kg(

˜z
|˜z|2 )e2˜u

in B1(0)\{0}.

17

Applying Lemma 4.6 and Lemma 4.5 to ˜u, we arrive at

u(z) − 2 log |˜z| = m1 log

1
|˜z|

+ o(log

1
|˜z|

) as |˜z| → 0+,

where m1 ≥ 1. Therefore,

u(z) = (2 − m1) log

1
|z|

+ o(log

1
|z|

) as |z| → ∞,

where m = 2 − m1 ≤ 1.

To see m > 0 when g is nonnegatively curved and nonﬂat, we recall

−∆u = Ke2u ≥ 0

in R2.

Taking the approach similar to that in the proof of Lemma 4.5, for 0 < r2 < r1, we have that

r2 ¯u′(r2) = r1¯u′(r1) +

1

2πZr2<|z|<r1

Ke2u,

(4.15)

where

Then

¯u(r) =

|¯u′(r)| ≤

2πZ 2π

1

0

u(r cos θ, r sin θ)dθ.

|∇u(r cos θ, r sin θ)|dθ

and therefore

lim
r2→0+
Plugging this back into (4.15), we have that

r2 ¯u′(r2) = 0.

r1¯u′(r1) = −

1

2πZ|z|<r1

Ke2u.

+ o(log |z|) as |z| → ∞, it follows that

r1¯u′(r1) = −m = −ZR2

lim
r1→∞

Ke2u < 0,

Now, from u = m log 1
|z|

unless Kg ≡ 0.
