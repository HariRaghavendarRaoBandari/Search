A CO-ANALYTIC COHEN-INDESTRUCTIBLE MAXIMAL

COFINITARY GROUP

VERA FISCHER, DAVID SCHRITTESSER, AND ASGER TÖRNQUIST

Abstract. Assuming that every set is constructible, we ﬁnd a Π1
1 max-
imal coﬁnitary group of permutations of N which is indestructible by
Cohen forcing. Thus we show that the existence of such groups is con-
sistent with arbitrarily large continuum. Our method also gives a new
proof, inspired by the forcing method, of Kastermans’ result that there
exists a Π1

1 maximal coﬁnitary group in L.

1. Introduction

(A) We denote the group of bijections (permutations) of N by S∞, and
its unit element by idN. An element of S∞ is coﬁnitary if and only if it has
only ﬁnitely many ﬁxed points, and G is called a coﬁnitary group precisely
if (up to isomorphism) G ≤ S∞ and all elements of G \ {idN} are coﬁnitary.
A coﬁnitary group is said to be maximal if and only if it is maximal under

inclusion among coﬁnitary groups.

Maximal coﬁnitary groups (or short, mcgs) have long been studied under
various aspects; see e.g. [3, 4, 1, 20, 21, 15]. A fair number of studies have
been devoted to the possible sizes of mcgs; their relation to maximal almost
disjoint (or mad) families, of which they are examples; as well as to inequali-
ties relating ag, i.e. the least size of a mcg, to other cardinal invariants of the
continuum; see e.g. [22, 23, 8, 2, 6]. Analogous questions about permutation
groups on κ, where κ is an uncountable cardinal, have also been studied; see
e.g. [5]. The isomorphism types of mcgs have been investigated in [12].

Finally, the line of research to which this paper belongs concerns the

deﬁnability of mcgs.

(B) While the existence of mcgs follows from the axiom of choice, the
question of whether a mcg can be deﬁnable has drawn considerable interest.
It was shown by Truss [20] and Adeleke [1] that no mcg can be countable;
this was improved by Kastermans’ result [11, Theorem 10] that no mcg can
be Kσ. On the other hand, Gao and Zhang [7] showed that assuming V = L,
there is a mcg with a co-analytic generating set. This, too, was improved by
Kastermans with the following theorem.

Theorem 1.1 ([11]). If V = L there is a Π1
mcg.

1 (i.e. eﬀectively co-analytic)

The previous theorem immediately raises the question of whether the ex-
1 mcg is consistent with V 6= L, or even with the negation of

istence if a Π1
the continuum hypothesis.

In this paper we answer these questions in the positive:

Theorem 1.2. The existence of a Π1
continuum (assuming the consistency of ZFC).

1 mcg is consistent with arbitrarily large

At the same, time we give a new proof of Kastermans’ Theorem 1.1.
Reproving Kastermans’ result is worthwhile for several reasons: ﬁrstly, our
method shows that in L, any countable coﬁnitary group is contained in
maximal, Π1
1, Cohen-indestructible coﬁnitary group. Secondly, the ‘coding
technique’ which ensures that the group is co-analytic, described in Deﬁnition
3.5, is much more straightforward than the one in [11]. Thirdly, this method
seems open to a wider range of variation, allowing to construct mcgs with
additional properties. In the present paper, this allows us to obtain a mcg
which is Cohen-indestructible, a property which we now deﬁne.

For this, ﬁrst observe that if G is a coﬁnitary group, then it remains so in

any model W of ZFC such that W ⊇ V.

Deﬁnition 1.3. Let G be a mcg and let C denote Cohen forcing. We say G
is Cohen-indestructible if and only if (cid:13)C ˇG is maximal.

The following is our main result; Theorem 1.2 is clearly a corollary.

Theorem 1.4. If V = L, there is a Π1

1 Cohen-indestructible mcg.

To prove the theorem, we ﬁrst ﬁnd a forcing which, given a coﬁnitary
group G and z ∈ 2N, adds a generic coﬁnitary group G′ such that G ≤ G′
and with the property that each element of G′ \ G lies above z in the Turing
hierarchy. To ﬁnd this forcing, we reﬁne Zhang’s forcing from [22] (also see
[6] and [5] for variations).

We then use this to give a new proof of Kastermans’ result Theorem
1.1, building our group from permutations which are generic over certain
countable initial segments of L. We use ideas from [5] to see that the group
produced in this manner is Cohen-indestructible.

(C) The paper is structured as follows. In §2, we establish basic termi-
nology. In particular, we establish a convenient shorthand notation for the
path of a natural number under the action of an element of S∞ on N. In
§3.1 we give a streamlined presentation of Zhang’s forcing QG, in order to
simplify the deﬁnition and discussion of our forcing Qz
G, which follows in 3.2;
the most important properties of Qz
G are collected in Theorem 3.15. In §4,

A CO-ANALYTIC COHEN-INDESTRUCTIBLE MAXIMAL COFINITARY GROUP

we prove our main result, Theorem 1.4, in a slightly more general form (The-
orem 4.2), obtaining Theorem 1.2 as a corollary. We close in §5 by listing
some questions which remain open.

2. Notation and Preliminaries

We start by reviewing the necessary deﬁnitions and introduce convenient

terminology, in particular the notion of a path.

(A) Since we build a generic element of S∞ from ﬁnite approximations,
we shall work with partial functions. We write par(N, N) for the set of partial
functions from N to N. For a ∈ par(N, N), when we write a(n) = k it is clearly
implied that n ∈ dom(a). We say a(n) is deﬁned to mean n ∈ dom(a) and
a(n) is undeﬁned otherwise. For the set of ﬁxed points of a we write

ﬁx(a) = {n ∈ N : a(n) = n}.

The set par(N, N) is naturally equipped with the operation of composition

of partial functions

(f g)(n) = m ⇐⇒ f (g(n)) = m,

making it an associative monoid.

Let G be an arbitrary group. By F(X) we denote the free group with single
generator X. Recall that the group G ∗ F(X), i.e. the free product of G and
F(X), is isomorphic to the set WG,X of reduced words from the alphabet
(cid:0)G \ {idN}(cid:1) ∪ {X, X −1}, equipped with the familiar ‘concatenate and reduce’
operation, the neutral element being the empty word, which we denote by ∅
(see e.g. [16, Normal Form Theorem]).

By a cyclic permutation of a non-empty word w = wn . . . w1 we mean the
result of reducing the word wσ(n) . . . wσ(1), where σ is a cyclic permutation
of {1, . . . , n}. By a subword of w we mean a contiguous subword wi . . . wj
for n ≥ i ≥ j ≥ 1, or the empty word. Thus, e.g. ca is a subword of a
cyclic permutation of abc. Of course, the empty word is both the only cyclic
permutation and the only subword of itself.

We call a group homomorphism ρ : G → S∞ a coﬁnitary representation of
G if and only if all elements of ran(ρ) are coﬁnitary. Clearly, if ρ is injective,
we may identify G with the coﬁnitary subgroup ran(G) ≤ S∞.

For the remainder of this section, assume G ≤ S∞. Choosing an arbitrary

s ∈ par(N, N) gives rise to a unique homomorphism of monoids

ρ : G ∗ F(X) → par(N, N)

4

VERA FISCHER, DAVID SCHRITTESSER, AND ASGER TÖRNQUIST

such that ρ(X) = s and ρ is the identity on G. It can be deﬁned by induction
on the length of words in the obvious way. Let’s denote this homomorphism
by ρG,s, departing from [6] (where it is precisely the map w 7→ ew(s)). Its
image is the compositional closure hG, si of G ∪ {s} in par(N, N).

Convention 2.1. Whenever G can be inferred from the context, we adopt the
convention to denote ρG,s(w) by w[s], for any w ∈ WG,X (we “substitute s
for X in w”; as e.g. in [22, 11]).

Observe that slightly awkwardly, by this convention, ∅[s] = idN for any

s ∈ par(N, N).

(B) In the remainder of this section, we deﬁne the notion of a path, which
will be extremely useful in the next section. Fix s ∈ par(N, N). Say w ∈
WG,X, and in reduced form

w = an . . . a1.

We deﬁne the path under (w, s) of m (also called the (w, s)-path of m) to

be the following sequence of natural numbers:

path(w, s, m) = hmi : i ∈ αi,

where m0 = m and for l, i ∈ N such that i > 0,

mnl+i =ai . . . a1wl[s](m0)

and for l > 1,

mnl =wl[s](mnl−1),

and α ∈ ω + 1 is maximal such that all of these expressions are deﬁned.

That is, we simply iterate applying all the letters of w as they appear
from right to left, and record the outcome until we reach a value not in the
domain of s. We can represent such a path e.g. as follows:

. . . mn+2

a2←− mn+1

a1←− mn

an←− . . .

a2←− m1

a1←− m0.

(supposing w has length n ≥ 2 and α > n + 2). We shall also use the phrase
that the letter ai occurs, or is applied (to mnl+i−1), at step nl + i in the path
(although strictly speaking, it is ai[s] that is applied).

If α < ω, we say the evaluation path (under (w, s) at m) terminates after
k = α − 1 steps and call mk last value (of this path).We shall also use the
phrase the (w, s)-path terminates before (an occurrence of ) the letter aj in
this situation (where j ≡ k + 1 mod n, 1 ≤ j ≤ n).

Sometimes we are interested in the path merely as a set, rather than as a

sequence; so let

use(w, s, m) = {mi : i < α}.

(C) Of course, we identify N and ω, but prefer to denote this set as N in
the context of permutations. We denote by |X| the cardinality of X, for any
set X. We do not regard it as compulsory to decorate names in the forcing

A CO-ANALYTIC COHEN-INDESTRUCTIBLE MAXIMAL COFINITARY GROUP

5

language with dots and checks as in [9]; we shall nevertheless freely use such
decorations occasionally, with the goal of aiding the reader.

3. Coding into a generic group extension

Fix, for this section, a coﬁnitary group G ≤ S∞. We want to enlarge this
group by σ∗ ∈ S∞, such that all of hG, σ∗i is coﬁnitary. This can be done
using a forcing invented by Zhang [22], which has proven extremely valuable
in applications (see [2, 23, 8, 24, 14, 7, 13]).

In Section 3.2, we introduce a new forcing Qz

G, based on Zhang’s QG,
such that in addition to the above, every element of hG, σ∗i not already in G
‘codes’ a given, ﬁxed z ∈ 2N, in a certain sense.

Before we introduce this new forcing notion, we give our own deﬁnition
of QG in Section 3.1, with ≤QG diﬀering slightly from [22]. We then analyze
carefully how paths behave when conditions in QG are extended, facilitating
the treatment of Qz
G.

Note that in the case of countable G, Zhang’s QG from [22], our version
G are all countable, i.e. particular

of QG described in §3.1, and the forcing Qz
presentations of Cohen forcing.

3.1. Zhang’s forcing, revisited. We now turn to our deﬁnition of the
forcing to add a generic group extending G.

Deﬁnition 3.1 (The forcing QG).

(a) Conditions of QG are pairs p = (sp, F p), where s ∈ par(N, N) is

injective and F ⊆ WG,X \ G is ﬁnite.

(b) (sq, F q) ≤QG (sp, F p) if and only if sq ⊇ sp, F q ⊇ F p and for all
w ∈ F p, if m ∈ ﬁx(w[sq]), then there is a non-empty subword w′ of
w such that use(w, sq, m) ∩ ﬁx(w′[sp]) 6= ∅.

For any condition p ∈ QG we write (sp, F p) if we want to refer to the

components of that condition.

This forcing produces a coﬁnitary representation of G ∗ F(X):

If G is

(V, QG)-generic, letting

σG = [

sp,

p∈G

we have σG ∈ S∞ and hG, σGi is a coﬁnitary group which is isomorphic to
G ∗ F(X).

Note that in (b) above, we demand that if q ≤QG p and sq gives rise to
a new ﬁxed point of w ∈ F p, then the (w, sq)-path of that ﬁxed point must
meet a certain ﬁnite set of numbers, where this set depends only on p. We
will see below in Lemma 3.10 and 3.12 that this guarantees that hG, σGi is
coﬁnitary.

As is pointed out in [22, p. 42f.], one cannot replace (b) by the simpler

6

VERA FISCHER, DAVID SCHRITTESSER, AND ASGER TÖRNQUIST

(b)′ (sq, F q) ≤QG (sp, F p) if and only if sq ⊇ sp, F q ⊇ F p and for all

w ∈ F p, if m ∈ ﬁx(w[sq]), then m ∈ ﬁx(w[sp]).

For with this simpler deﬁnition, supposing n ∈ ﬁx(g), any condition p such
that X −1gX ∈ F p and n /∈ ran(sp) cannot be extended to any q so that
n ∈ ran(sq). Similar examples abound; (b) is formulated to pinpoint the
problem.

In a previous paper [6] by two of the present authors, restricting F p to
contain only so-called ‘good words’ made it possible to deﬁne ≤QG as in (b)′.
Here, we deﬁne ≤QG diﬀerently from [6] and also slightly diﬀerently from
[22]. This allows the coding to apply to arbitrary words (only subject to
the obvious constraint that they not be from G), while at the same time
simplifying the proofs of the Extension Lemmas (see below).

We now prove increasingly stronger versions of the Domain Extension
Lemma, culminating in a crucial lemma concerning the length of certain
paths (Lemma 3.4). This will considerably clean up the presentation when
we deal with the more complicated forcing Qz
G. All other proofs regarding
QG will be omitted; but note that they can be easily inferred from their
counterparts for Qz

G in the next section.

The following is implicitly shown in [22]; we include a very short proof,

for the convenience of the reader.

Lemma 3.2 (Contingent Domain Extension for QG). Let s ∈ par(N, N)
and w ∈ WG,X be arbitrary, and suppose n ∈ N is such that n /∈ ﬁx(w′[s])
for any non-empty subword w′ of w. Then for a coﬁnite set of n′, letting
s′ = s ∪ {(n, n′)}, we have that s′ is injective and ﬁx(w[s′]) = ﬁx(w[s]).

Proof. Let W ∗ be the set of subwords of cyclic permutations of w and pick
n′ arbitrary such that

(3.1)

n′ /∈ [ (cid:8) ﬁx(w′[s]) : w′ ∈ W ∗ \ {∅}(cid:9),
n′ /∈ [ (cid:8)w′[s]i(n) : i ∈ {−1, 1}, w′ ∈ W ∗(cid:9), and
n′ /∈ ran(s) ∪ dom(s).

As ∅ ∈ W ∗, (3.1) ensures that s′ is injective.

Assume towards a contradiction that m0 ∈ ﬁx(w[s′]) \ ﬁx(w[s]). Write the

(w, s′)-path of m0 as
wn←− mk(n)

wn−1←− . . .

w2←− mk(2)

X j(1)
←− mk(1)

X j(n−1)

←− mk(n−1)

(3.2) m0
where for each i, mk(i) = n when j(i) = 1 and mk(i) = n′ when j(i) = −1,
and wi ∈ WG,X is such that wi[s] = wi[s′]; that is, from mk(i) to mk(i+1), the
path contains no application of X to n or of X −1 to n′. Further, we allow
any wi to be empty, but otherwise no cancellation (that is, the number of
applications of X to n and X −1 to n′ together is exactly n − 1). As m0 is
not a ﬁxed point of w[s], n ≥ 2.

w1←− m0

Assume n > 2. We make some simple observations:

A CO-ANALYTIC COHEN-INDESTRUCTIBLE MAXIMAL COFINITARY GROUP

7

1. mk(2) = mk(3); for otherwise, n′ = (w2)j[s](n) for j ∈ {−1, 1}, con-

tradicting the choice of n′.

2. Thus, w2 6= ∅, since on one side of w2 we have X and on the other

X −1 and they may not cancel.

3. As n′ /∈ ﬁx(w2[s]), we have that mk(2) = mk(3) = n.
4. So n ∈ ﬁx(w2[s]), contradicting the hypothesis of the lemma.

Thus n = 2, and the (w, s′)-path of m0 has the form
w1←− m0.

X j
←− mk(1)

m0

w2←− mk(2)

Supposing, with out loss of generality, that j = 1, the above becomes:

m0

w2←− n′ X←− n

w1←− m0.

We infer that n = w1w2[s](n′), again contradicting the choice of n′.

(cid:3)

This puts us in the position to give a short proof of Lemmas 2.2 and 2.3

from [22]:

Lemma 3.3 (Domain Extension for QG). For any n ∈ N, the set of q such
that n ∈ dom(sq) is dense in Q.

Proof. Fix p ∈ Q; we shall ﬁnd a stronger condition q ∈ Q such that n ∈
dom(sq). Analogously to the previous proof, let F ∗ consist of all words which
are a subword of a cyclic permutation of a word in F p, and let n′ be arbitrary
such that

(3.3)

n′ /∈ [{ﬁx(w[s]) : w ∈ F ∗ \ {idN}},
n′ /∈ [ (cid:8)w[s]i(n) : i ∈ {−1, 1}, w ∈ F ∗ ∪ {∅}(cid:9), and
n′ /∈ ran(sp) ∪ dom(s).

Note that (3.3) excludes only ﬁnitely many possible values for n′. Deﬁne
s′ = s ∪ {(n, n′)} and q = (s′, F p). As in the proof of Lemma 3.2, s is
injective.

Given w ∈ F p and supposing m0 ∈ ﬁx(w[s′]) \ ﬁx(w[s]), the proof of
the previous lemma shows that there is a subword w′ of w such that n ∈
ﬁx(w′[s]). As moreover, n shows up in the (w, s′)-path of m0, we have

use(w, s′, m) ∩ ﬁx(w′[s]) 6= ∅.

Thus, q ≤QG p.

(cid:3)

A crucial observation for the following discussion of Qz

G is that when ex-
tending the domain of sp for a given condition p, we have ﬁne control over
the length of paths that result from this extension.

Lemma 3.4 (Domain Extension for QG, Strong Version). Fix w ∈ WG,X
and m ∈ N. Moreover, let s ∈ par(N, N) and n ∈ N \ dom(s) be given.

Then for coﬁnitely many n′ ∈ N, if we let s′ = s ∪ {(n, n′)} the following

obtains:

8

VERA FISCHER, DAVID SCHRITTESSER, AND ASGER TÖRNQUIST

1. If the (w, s)-path of m terminates with last value n before an occur-
rence of X, the (w, s′)-path of m contains exactly one more applica-
tion of X than does the (w, s)-path.

2. If the (w, s)-path of m does not terminate with last value n before an

occurrence of X, path(w, s′, m) = path(w, s, m).

Proof. Let E = dom(s) ∪ ran(s) ∪ {n} ∪ {m} and W ∗ be the set of subwords
of cyclic permutations of w. Suppose n′ is arbitrary such that

(3.4)

n′ /∈ [ (cid:8) ﬁx(w′[s]) : w′ ∈ W ∗ \ {∅}(cid:9) and
n′ /∈ [ (cid:8)w′[s]i[E] : i ∈ {−1, 1}, w′ ∈ W ∗(cid:9).

For Case 2 of the lemma, suppose that the (w, s)-path of m terminates
after k steps with last value mk before an occurrence of X j, j ∈ {−1, 1}. We
must show path(w, s′, m) = path(w, s, m).

If j = 1, mk 6= n by assumption; and as the (w, s)-path terminates with
mk, we have mk /∈ dom(s). Therefore mk /∈ dom(s′) = dom(s) ∪ {n} and
the (w, s′)-path terminates as well.

So assume towards a contradiction that j = −1 and mk+1 in the (w, s′)-
path of m is deﬁned. As the (w, s)-path terminates with mk, before an
occurrence of X −1, while (w, s′)-path does not terminate, mk = n′. Thus,
n′ ∈ w′[s](m) for a subword w′ of w, contradicting (3.4).

Now consider Case 1 of the lemma. Suppose that, using the same notation
as in (3.2) in the proof of Lemma 3.2, the (w, s)-path of m terminates after
k(l) steps with last value mk(l) = n before an occurrence of X. We must
show that the (w, s′)-path terminates after k(l + 1) steps.

Note mk(l) = n′; we must examine the value mk(l+1), where

mk(l+1) = wl+1[s′](n′) = wl+1[s](n′).

This is indeed the last value in the (w, s′)-path, proving the lemma; for
otherwise,

or

n′ ∈ (wl+1)−1[E]

n′ ∈ ﬁx(wl+1),

contradicting (3.4).

(cid:3)

Here we end our discussion of QG.

3.2. Coding into a generic coﬁnitary group extension. Our next goal
is to modify QG so that all new elements of our generic coﬁnitary represen-
tation compute a ﬁxed, given real. That is, given z ∈ 2N, we deﬁne Qz
G
such that whenever G is (V, Qz
G)-generic, the following holds: There exists
σG ∈ S∞ such that for each σ ∈ hG, σGi \ G, we have z ≤T σ.

A CO-ANALYTIC COHEN-INDESTRUCTIBLE MAXIMAL COFINITARY GROUP

9

First, we describe the algorithm by which z is computed from an element
of hG, σGi \ G. Since our forcing shall use ﬁnite approximations to σG, we
deﬁne the coding for elements of par(N, N).

Deﬁnition 3.5 (Coding).

(1) We say that σ ∈ par(N, N) codes a ﬁnite string t ∈ 2l with parameter

m ∈ N iﬀ

(∀k < l) w[s]k(m) ≡ t(k) mod 2.

We say it exactly codes t (with parameter m) if it codes t and in
addition, w[s]l(m) is undeﬁned.

(2) We say that σ ∈ par(N, N) codes z ∈ 2N with parameter m iﬀ

(∀k ∈ N) σk(m) ≡ z(k) mod 2.

Fix, for the rest of this section, an arbitrary non-periodic z ∈ 2N. Now we

can deﬁne the forcing.

Deﬁnition 3.6 (Deﬁnition of Q = Qz

G).

(A) Conditions of Q are triples p = (sp, F p, ¯mp) s.t.

(1) (sp, F p) ∈ QG
(2) ¯mp is a partial function from F p to N.
(3) For any w ∈ dom( ¯mp) there is l ∈ ω such that w[sp] exactly

codes z ↾ l with parameter ¯mp(w).

(4) If w, w′ ∈ dom( ¯mp) and w 6= w′,

use(w, s, ¯mp(w)) ∩ use(w′, s, ¯mp(w′)) = ∅

(B) (sq, F q, ¯mq) ≤ (sp, F p, ¯mp) if and only if both

(1) (sq, F q) ≤QG (sp, F p),
(2) ¯mq extends ¯mp.

For any condition p ∈ Q we write (sp, F p, ¯mp) if we want to refer to the

components of that condition.

Note that the non-periodicity of z together with (A3) ensures that no
path under (w, sp) at ¯m(w) is eventually periodic. Thus for any p ∈ Q and
w ∈ dom( ¯m), the path under (w, sp) of ¯mp(w) must be ﬁnite and contain no
repetitions (although other paths may be eventually periodic).

Also note that by (A4), |G| is collapsed to ω by Q whenever G is uncount-

able in the ground model.

We now prove a series of lemmas to help us show that forcing with Q
achieves our goal. For a (V, Q)-generic G, as in the previous section we let

σG = [

sp.

p∈G

We shall show hG, σGi is a coﬁnitary group which is isomorphic to G ∗ F(X)
and for any τ ∈ hG, σGi \ G, τ codes z.

10

VERA FISCHER, DAVID SCHRITTESSER, AND ASGER TÖRNQUIST

We begin with a Lemma showing that σG is forced by Q to be totally
deﬁned on N. The second, stronger claim in the lemma will be useful for the
Generic Hitting Lemma and the proof that ρG,σG is forced to be injective.

Lemma 3.7 (Domain Extension).

1. For any n ∈ N, the set of q such that n ∈ dom(sq) is dense in Q.
2. In fact, suppose p ∈ Q and n ∈ N are such that for some w∗ ∈ WG,X
and m∗ ∈ N, n is the last value of path(w∗, sp, m∗) and this path
terminates before an occurrence of X. Then one can ﬁnd q ∈ Q such
that q ≤ p and path(w∗, sq, m∗) contains exactly one more application
of X, and no further application of X −1, than does path(w∗, sp, m∗).

While Part 2 of the lemma is only strictly necessary for the proof of Lemma

3.14, its proof presents no additional burden.

Before we prove the lemma, to avoid repetition, we introduce the following
terminology: Fix w ∈ WG,X and j ∈ {−1, 1}. We call an occurrence of X j in
w critical if there is no occurrence of X or X −1 in w to its left. Otherwise,
we call it an uncritical occurrence. Clearly, it is through a critical occurrence
of X (resp. X −1) in some word in dom( ¯m) that the coding requirements
from (A3) restrict our possibilities to extend dom(sp) (resp. ran(sp)).

Proof of Lemma 3.7. Let p ∈ Q, w∗ ∈ WG,X, and m∗, n ∈ N be as above
and suppose n 6∈ dom(sp). We will ﬁnd n′ such that for s′ = sp ∪ {(n, n′)},
q = (s′, F p, ¯mp) is a condition stronger than p.

Write s for sp and ¯m for ¯mp. Let

E = ran(s) ∪ dom(s) ∪ {n} ∪ ran( ¯m) ∪ {m∗},

and let F ∗ consist of all words which are a subword of a cyclic permutation
of a word in F p ∪ {w∗}. The ﬁrst requirement we make is that n′ be chosen
such that

(3.5)

n′ /∈ [{ﬁx(w[s]) : w ∈ F ∗ \ {∅}} and
n′ /∈ [ (cid:8)gwi[s][E] : i ∈ {−1, 1}, w ∈ F ∗, g ∈ F ∗ ∩ G(cid:9).

Note that (3.5) excludes only ﬁnitely many possible values for n′. That in
addition to the now familiar requirements, we close of under g ∈ F ∗ ∩ G in
(3.5) serves only one purpose, namely to ensure that

(3.6)

g(n′) /∈ [{use(w, s, ¯m(w)) : w ∈ dom( ¯m)}

for g = idN as well as for all g ∈ G occuring in a word from F p.

If for some w ∈ dom( ¯m), n appears in the (w, s)-path of ¯m(w) before
a critical occurrence of X, we must make an additional requirement. So
ﬁx such w, and note that there is no other w′ ∈ dom( ¯m) in whose path n
appears. Let l be maximal such that w[s] codes z ↾ l with parameter ¯m(w).
Further, suppose w = gXw′, where w′ ∈ WG,X and we allow g ∈ G to be idN

A CO-ANALYTIC COHEN-INDESTRUCTIBLE MAXIMAL COFINITARY GROUP 11

but no cancellation in Xw′. Now in addition to (3.5), require that g(n′) be
even if z(l) = 0 and odd if z(l) = 1.

To see that q is a condition, it suﬃces to check (A3). Towards a contradic-
tion, let m = ¯m(w) and assume wl+1[s′](m) 6≡ z(l) (mod 2). As w[s] exactly
codes an initial segment of z, the (w, s′)-path is longer than the (w, s)-path
of m. Thus, by choice of n′ and the proof of Lemma 3.4, we have that Case 1
in the statement of Lemma 3.4 holds: The (w, s)-path of m terminates with
last value n before an occurrence of X, and the (w, s′)-path of m continues
for exactly one or two more steps, as follows:

wl+1[s′](m)

g
←− n′ X←− n ←− . . . ,

where we allow g ∈ G to be idN. Thus, the occurrence of X in the above is
critical; but then n′ was chosen so that wl+1[s′](m) = g(n′) ≡ z(l) (mod 2),
in contradiction to the assumption.

We have seen that if (w, s)-path and the (w, s′)-path of ¯m(w) diﬀer for
w ∈ dom( ¯m), then the latter must terminate with n. Thus, by (A4), at most
one such path acquires new values, and these were seen to be n′ and possibly
g(n′), where g ∈ G occurs in a word in dom( ¯m). By (3.6), requirement (A4)
holds of q, allowing us to conclude that q is a condition in Q.

We end the proof of Part 1 of the lemma by quoting the proof of the

Domain Extension Lemma for QG to conclude that q ≤ p.

For Part 2 of the lemma, note that by the proof of Lemma 3.4, indeed
the (w∗, s)-path of m∗ contains exactly one more application of X, and no
further application of X −1, than does the (w∗, s′)-path of m∗.
(cid:3)

Remark 3.8. It can be checked that (3.5) is not the minimal requirement
(and neither are (3.3) or (3.1)). One can arrive easily at a minimal version
of this requirement by listing precisely which types of words in F ∗ are needed
in the proof.

The next lemma shows that Q forces σG to be onto N.

Lemma 3.9 (Range Extension).

1. For any n ∈ N, the set of q such that n ∈ ran(sq) is dense in Q.
2. In fact, suppose p ∈ Q and n ∈ N are such for some w∗ ∈ WG,X
and m∗ ∈ N, n is the last value of path(w∗, sp, m∗) and this path
terminates before an occurrence of X −1. Then one can ﬁnd q ∈
Q such that q ≤ p and path(w∗, sq, ¯m∗) contains exactly one more
application of X −1 than does path(w∗, sp, ¯m∗).

Proof. The lemma is entirely symmetrical to the Domain Extension Lemma.
By symmetry, the proofs of Lemmas 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.7 can easily be
adapted.
(cid:3)

By the previous two lemmas, (cid:13)Q σ ˙G ∈ S∞. By the next two lemmas, Q

forces that for all w ∈ WG,X, w[σ ˙G] codes z, as promised:

12

Lemma 3.10. For any w ∈ WG,X, the set of q such that w ∈ F q is dense
in Q.

Proof. Simply observe that (sp, F p ∪ {w}, ¯mp) is a condition in Qz
G.

(cid:3)

Lemma 3.11 (Generic Coding). If p ∈ Q, w ∈ WG,X \ G and l ∈ N, there is
q ≤ p such that w ∈ dom( ¯m) and q exactly codes z ↾ l with parameter ¯m(w).

Proof. Fix p, w and l as above. We may assume w ∈ dom( ¯mp); otherwise,
ﬁnd an n′ ∈ N such that (3.5) holds and replace F p by F p ∪ {w} and ¯mp by
¯mp ∪ {(w, n′)} in p and call the result p′. By (3.5), (A4) is satisﬁed for p′
and by the argument in the proof of Lemma 3.4, the (w, sp′
)-path of n′ will
terminate before the right-most application of X or X −1 in w. As sp = sp′
,
this suﬃces to show p′ is a condition below p.

So supposing w ∈ dom( ¯mp), let m′ be the last value of the (w, sp)-path of
¯m(w) and assume this path terminates before an occurrence of the letter X.
By the Domain Extension Lemma, we may ﬁnd q ≤ p such that m′ ∈ dom(sq)
and the (w, sq)-path at ¯m(w) terminates either at the next step or after one
further application of a letter in G \ {idN}.

If instead the (w, sp)-path of ¯m(w) terminates before an occurrence of the

letter X −1, argue similarly using the Range Extension Lemma.

Repeating until the path has length nl + 1; we obtain a condition q such
(cid:3)

that sq exactly codes z ↾ l.

By the next lemma, hG, σGi is forced to be coﬁnitary. The reader may
care to notice that the proofs of the remaining lemmas, up to Theorem 4.2,
go through (sometimes in simpler form) for hQG, ≤Gi (as was the case for
Lemma 3.10).

Lemma 3.12. For all w ∈ WG,x, (cid:13)Q ﬁx(w[σ ˙G]) is ﬁnite.

Proof. We shall show that whenever p ∈ Q satisﬁes w ∈ F p, there is N such
that p (cid:13) ﬁx(w[σ ˙G]) \ ﬁx(w[sp]) has size at most N . Thus, the set of p which
force ﬁx(w[σ ˙G]) to be ﬁnite, is dense.

Let q ≤ p be arbitrary. Consider

(3.7)

n ∈ ﬁx(w[sq]) \ ﬁx(w[sp]).

Then letting hmk, . . . , m0i be the (w, sq)-path of n, we have that for some
l ≤ k, ml ∈ ﬁx(u[sp]), for some subword u of a word in F p. For each n
satisfying (3.7), pick some such l = l(n) and u = u(n) and let m(n) = ml ∈
ﬁx(u[sp]). If we have

n, n′ ∈ ﬁx(w[sq]) \ ﬁx(w[sp]),

such that l(n) = l(n′), u(n) = u(n′) and m(n) = m(n′), it must be that
n = n′ (by injectivity).1

1Although we do not use this here, the reader may care to note that in fact, m(n) =
′) implies u(n) = u(n

′) by (A4) of Deﬁnition 3.6.

m(n

A CO-ANALYTIC COHEN-INDESTRUCTIBLE MAXIMAL COFINITARY GROUP 13

Let N be the number of triples (l, u, m) such that l is less than the length
of w, u is a subword of w, and m ∈ ﬁx(u[sp]). We have that no q ≤ p can
force that (w[σ ˙G]) has more than N ﬁxed points not already in ﬁx(w[sp]). (cid:3)
The next lemma shows that our construction yields a group which is max-
imal with respect to permutations from the ground model. It is a special
case of the P-generic Hitting Lemma in §4.

Lemma 3.13 (Generic Hitting). For any σ ∈ S∞ and m ∈ N, the set of q
such that there is n ≥ m with sq(n) = σ(n), is dense.

Proof. This follows from the P-generic Hitting Lemma below; we give a sep-
arate proof for the sake of clarity.

Let p ∈ Q, σ ∈ S∞ and m ∈ N be given. Find n ∈ N such that n ≥ m,
and such that letting n′ = σ(n), n′ satisﬁes the ﬁrst requirement given in the
proof of the Domain Extension Lemma, i.e. (3.5) with F ∗ as deﬁned there.
Such n exists, as these requirements exclude only a ﬁnite set n ∈ N. By
the proof of the Domain Extension Lemma, letting s′ = sp ∪ {(n, σ(n))},
q = (s′, F p) is a condition stronger that p.
(cid:3)

Although this is not needed in the rest of this paper, for the sake of

completeness we also show the following:

Lemma 3.14. Q forces that ρG,σG is injective.

Proof. It is enough to show that for any p ∈ Q, w ∈ WG,X \ G and g ∈ G, we
can ﬁnd q ≤ p such that

q (cid:13)Q w[σ ˙G] 6= ˇg.

By taking inverses, we can assume without loss of generality that w starts
with X and ends with X j for j ∈ {−1, 1}. Now suppose w has length k.

Pick n /∈ dom(sp) ∪ ran(sp), or in any case such that the (w, sp) path of
n terminates before reaching the kth step. If necessary, by repeatedly using
the proof of the Domain extension Lemma or the Range extension Lemma,
ﬁnd p′ ≤ p such that the (w, sp′
)-path of n terminates after exactly k − 1
steps, before the ﬁrst letter from the left in w, i.e. X. Let m be its last value.
As m /∈ dom(sp′
), we may easily extend p′ once more to obtain q ∈ Q, q ≤ p′
such that sq(m) 6= g(n), since the proof of the Domain Extension Lemma
shows we can chose sq(m) arbitrarily in a co-ﬁnite subset of N.
(cid:3)

We sum up the crucial properties of Qz

G in the following theorem:

Theorem 3.15. Let G ≤ S∞ be coﬁnitary and suppose z ∈ 2N is not periodic.
Let M be a transitive ∈-model satisfying the axiom of separation and such
that Q ∈ M . Let G be (M, Qz

G)-generic. Then, letting

σG = [

sp

p∈G

we have:

(I) σG ∈ S∞

14

VERA FISCHER, DAVID SCHRITTESSER, AND ASGER TÖRNQUIST

(II) hG, σGi is a coﬁnitary group isomorphic to G ∗ F(X).
(III) For any word w ∈ WG,X \ G, we have that w[σG] codes z in the sense

of deﬁnition 3.5, and thus z ≤T w[σG].

(IV) For any τ ∈ coﬁn(S∞) ∩ M such that τ /∈ G, there is no coﬁnitary

group G′ such that

hG, σGi ∪ {τ } ⊆ G′.

Proof. The only ﬁne point here is that we do not assume that M can deﬁne
the forcing relation. We thus have to circumvent its use.

The Domain and Range Extension Lemmas can be seen as describing a
countable family of dense subsets of Q, and by separation each of them is an
element of M . Thus G meets each of them, proving (I).

The proof of Lemma 3.12 likewise describes a family of dense sets, and as

G meets each of them, ran(ρG,σG) = hG, σGi is coﬁnitary.

By analogous arguments, (II), (III) and (IV) are obtained using dense sets
described in (the proofs of) Lemma 3.14, the Generic Coding Lemma and
the Hitting Lemma, respectively.
(cid:3)

4. A co-analytic Cohen-indestructible mcg

We now use the ideas from the previous section to prove the main results

of this paper, Theorem 4.2 and Corollary 4.4 below.

At the same time, we give a new proof of Kastermans’ result that there
is a Π1
1, maximal coﬁnitary group in L, based on forcing. While for the ap-
propriate choice of G0, our method will produce a group which is isomorphic
to Kastermans’, these groups are not outright identical.
In fact, we shall
see our group is Cohen-indestructible, which is unlikely to be the case for
Kastermans’ group.

The main result of this paper can be harvested using the following lemma,
which implies that for any forcing P ∈ V, the group extension generically
added to V by P × Q is maximal with respect to S∞ ∩ VP. It draws in-
spiration from [5, Theorem 4.1], where a Cohen-indestructible mcg was ﬁrst
constructed.

Lemma 4.1 (P-generic hitting). Let G, z and Q = Qz
G be as in Theorem
3.15. Let an arbitrary forcing P, a P-name ˙τ , a condition (p, q) ∈ P × Q and
k ∈ ω be given and suppose p (cid:13)P ˙τ ∈ S∞ and ˙τ is coﬁnitary.

Then there is (p′, q′) ∈ P × Q such that (p′, q′) ≤P×Q (p, q) and

(p′, q′) (cid:13)P×Q (∃n ∈ N) n > k ∧ σ ˙G(n) = τ (n).

Proof. Extend p to p′ ∈ P such that for some pair n, n′ ∈ N, we have that

p′ (cid:13)P ˙τ (ˇn) = ˇn′,

n /∈ dom(sq)

and, letting s = sq, ¯m = ¯mq and F ∗ be the set of subwords of cyclic per-
mutations of words in F q, n′ satisﬁes (3.5). This is possible as the above

A CO-ANALYTIC COHEN-INDESTRUCTIBLE MAXIMAL COFINITARY GROUP 15

requirements for n and n′ exclude only ﬁnitely many n and ﬁnitely many n′
and as p (cid:13) ˙τ is coﬁnitary.

By the Domain Extension Lemma we can extend q to q′ ∈ Q such that

q′ (cid:13)Q σ ˙G(ˇn) = ˇn′,

and we are done.

(cid:3)

We are now ready to prove the main theorem of this paper:

Theorem 4.2. Assume V = L. Let G0 be any countable coﬁnitary group,
and ﬁx c ∈ 2N such that G0 is ∆1
1(c) as a subset of NN. Then there is a
Cohen-indestructible Π1
1(c) maximal coﬁnitary group which contains G0 as a
subgroup.

Our argument resembles Miller’s classical construction of co-analytic sets

given in [19].

To simplify matters, we adopt the following convention: Given x ∈ 2N, let

Ex ⊆ ω2 be the binary relation deﬁned by

m Ex n ⇐⇒ x(2m3n) = 0.

If it is the case that Ex is well-founded and extensional, we denote by Mx
the unique countable transitive ∈-model isomorphic to hω, Exi,

Note also that for any countable transitive set M , we can ﬁnd x ∈ 2N such
, for y ∈ 2N, then we may ﬁnd

that hM, ∈i ∼= Mx. Moreover, if M ∈ L
such x ∈ L

ωy
1

.

ωy
1

Proof. Fix G0 as above. Since the argument relativizes to any parameter c,
we may suppress c and assume that G0 is (lightface) ∆1
1.

Work in L. For each ξ < ω1 we shall deﬁne

• δ(ξ), a countable ordinal,
• zξ ∈ 2N ∩ L
• σξ ∈ S∞ ∩ L

δ(ξ)+ω which is non-periodic,
δ(ξ)+ω.

We deﬁne these so that the following is satisﬁed for each ξ < ω1:

(i) δ(ξ) is the least ordinal δ above supν<ξ δ(ν) such that Lδ projects to

ω and G0 ∈ Lδ.

(ii) zξ is the unique code for the theory of L
ical deﬁnable surjection from ω onto L

δ(ξ), obtained via the canon-
δ(ξ) (see, e.g. [10]).

(iii) Letting Gξ = { σν : ν < ξ} ∪ G0, we have that Gξ is coﬁnitary and

Gξ ∈ L

δ(ξ).

(iv) σξ = σG, where G is the unique (L

δ(ξ), Q

zξ
Gξ

)-generic obtained using

the canonical deﬁnable surjection from ω onto L

δ(ξ).

Obtaining such a sequence is straight-forward, since (i) and (ii) determine
h(δ(ξ), zξ ) : ξ < ω1i, and assuming (iii) by induction, (iv) uniquely deter-
mines σξ from the sequence h(δ(ν), σν ) : ν < ξi. Let

G = [
ξ<ω1

Gξ,

16

VERA FISCHER, DAVID SCHRITTESSER, AND ASGER TÖRNQUIST

which is a coﬁnitary group by (iii) above.

Claim 4.3. As a subset of NN, G is Π1
1.

Proof of Claim. Let Ψ(~x) be the formula saying that for some ξ, ~x is a

sequence

~x = h(ρ(ξ), zξ, σξ) : ξ ≤ ζi,

such that for every ξ < ζ, (i), (ii) and (iv) above hold. That is, Ψ(~x) holds
if and only if ~x is an initial segment of our construction above.

Note that Ψ(~x) is absolute for all transitive models of a certain fragment
of ZFC—say, Mathias’ MW from [18]—satisﬁed by all initial segments of the
L-hierarchy of limit height.

Thus, membership in G is determined by a Σ1(H(ω1)) formula: σ ∈ G

holds if and only if

(4.1)

there exists a countable ∈-model M of MW s.t. for some ~x ∈ M ,
M (cid:15) “~x = h(δζ , zζ , τζ) : ζ ≤ ξi) ∧ Ψ(~x)” and σ = (τξ)M .

In fact, examining our construction of the sequence h(δ(ξ), zξ , σξ) : ξ < ω1i,
one ﬁnds that for σ = σξ, we can take M in (4.1) to be L

δ(ξ)+ω.

Let Φ(y, σ) be the formula expressing that Ey is well-founded and exten-

sional, My |= MW and for some ~x ∈ My,

My (cid:15) “~x = h(δζ , zζ, τζ) : ζ ≤ ξi) ∧ Ψ(~x)”

with σ = (τξ)My . We can take Φ(y, σ) to be a Π1

1 formula.

Thus (4.1) is equivalent to

(∃y ∈ 2N) Φ(y, σ).

We now make use of the fact that y as in the preceding formula can be found
eﬀectively in σ.

Since a well-order of length δ(ξ) is computable in zξ and zξ ≤T σξ, we
δ(ξ)+ω can be found inside

σξ
1 . Thus, y ∈ 2N such that My = L

have δ(ξ) < ω
Lωσ

1 when σ = σξ. This gives us “⇒” in the following (“⇐” is obvious):

σ ∈ G ⇐⇒ (∃y ∈ 2N ∩ Lωσ

1 ) Φ(y, σ).

By Mansﬁeld-Solovay [17, Corollary 4.19, p. 53], the right-hand side can be
rendered as a Π1
(cid:3)Claim.

1 formula, proving the claim.

Since any σ ∈ S∞ appears in some Lδ(ξ), maximality of G follows from
(IV) of Theorem 3.15, and (iv) above. In fact, we show the stronger state-
ment that G is Cohen-indestructible:

Towards a contradiction, suppose we have a C-name ˙τ and p ∈ C such

that

(4.2)

p (cid:13)C h ˇG, ˙τ i is coﬁnitary.

A CO-ANALYTIC COHEN-INDESTRUCTIBLE MAXIMAL COFINITARY GROUP 17

We may assume that there is ξ < ω1 such that ˙τ ∈ Lδ(ξ). In fact, we may
assume that there is a ∆0( ˙τ , C) formula Ψ(x, y, z) such that for all p′ ∈ C
below p and all n, n′ ∈ N,

p (cid:13)C ˙τ (ˇn) = ˇn′

is equivalent to Ψ(p, n, k) (by choosing a ‘nice’ name).

We may also assume that there is N such that

p (cid:13)C |{n ∈ N : ˇσξ(n) = ˙τ (n)}| = ˇN .

By repeatedly using Lemma 4.1, the set D of q ∈ Q
such that for some
p′ ∈ C stronger than p and for some set Z ⊆ dom(sq) of size N + 1 we have

zξ
Gξ

(4.3)

(∀n ∈ Z) p′ (cid:13)C ˙τ (ˇn) = ˇsq(ˇn)

zξ
Gξ

. As (4.3) can be replaced by a ∆0 formula, D ∈ L

δ(ξ). Thus,
is dense in Q
Gξ meets D and we conclude that for some p′ ∈ C stronger than p and for
some set Z ⊆ N of size N + 1 we have

(∀n ∈ Z) p′ (cid:13)C ˙τ (ˇn) = ˇσξ(ˇn),

contradicting the assumption (4.2); thus, G is Cohen-indestructible.

(cid:3)

We obtain as an immediate corollary:

Corollary 4.4. Theorem 1.2 holds: The existence of a Π1
1 maximal coﬁnitary
group is consistent with ¬ CH (in fact, with arbitrarily large continuum),
provided ZFC is consistent.

5. Questions

We close by posing some questions that remain open. Considering the
many known models where some inequality holds between ag and other car-
dinal invariants of the continuum, the methods developed in the present
paper suggest to consider the following deﬁnable analog.

For Γ an arbitrary pointclass, let ag(Γ) be the least cardinal κ such that

there is a mcg G ∈ Γ of size κ.

Question 5.1. How does ag(Π1
continuum?

1) compare to other cardinal invariants of the

Lastly, we would like to mention the following long-standing open question

in relation to deﬁnable mcgs:

Question 5.2. Can a mcg be Borel (equivalently, analytic)?

Note that it is still open whether ZFC rules out that a mcg be closed.
