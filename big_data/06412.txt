SOME REMARKS ON EXPANDING MAPS.

F. MICENA

Abstract. In this work we treat a famous topic in Ergodic Theory and Dynam-
ical Systems: uniformly expanding maps. We relate regularity of expanding
maps and conjugacies with Lyapunov exponents, metric and topological en-
tropies for expanding maps of the circle. In Theorem C, we present a result of
rigidity of expanding maps on the torus T2, after we naturally generalize it in
higher dimensions. Here, we present techniques involving ordinary diﬀeren-
tial equations to study rigidity problems of expanding maps. Along of this
work we provide another proof of a Shub-Sullivan’s Theorem, concerning the
regularity of the conjugacy between expanding endomorphism of the circle.

1. Introduction and Statements of the Results

Expanding maps are an important object of study in dynamical systems.
Roughly speaking an expanding map is a C1 transformation of a riemannian
manifold M that it dilates distances between distinct points by a factor λ > 1.
Deﬁnition 1.1 (Expanding maps). Let M be a C∞−complete riemannian manifold,
∂M = ∅. A C1−endomorphism f : M → M is expanding if there are constants C > 0
and λ > 1 such that for every x ∈ M we have ||D f n(x) · v|| ≥ Cλn||v||, for any n ∈ N
and v ∈ TxM.

Expanding endomorphism of the circle is one of the most studied examples
of dynamical systems. A more classical class of expanding endomorphisms
of the circle are the linear models Ed : S1 → S1, Ed(x) = dx(mod1), where d ≥ 2
is an integer number. It is very known that if f : S1 → S1 is an orientation
preserving expanding endomorphism of the circle with degree d ≥ 2, then f
is conjugated with Ed, it means that there is a homeomorphism h : S1 → S1,
such that f ◦ h = h ◦ Ed. In particular two orientation preserving expanding
endomorphisms of the circle f and g with the same degree, (deg( f ) = deg(g)),
In the case that f, g as above are Cr, r ≥ 2, two orientation
are conjugated.
preserving expanding endomorphism of S1, it is known by Shub-Sullivan result
in [12], that f and g are absolutely continuous conjugated by a conjugacy h if
and only if h is Cr, r ≥ 2.

An important fact is that every Cr, r ≥ 2, expanding map f of the circle
admits a unique borelian probability invariant measure µ f which is absolutely

continuous with respect to the normalized Lebesgue measure m of the S1,
moreover µ f is ergodic.

Let f : S1 → S1 be a C1 expanding map, we deﬁne the set of regular points of f

R f = (cid:26)x ∈ S1| there is the limit λ f (x) := lim

n→+∞

n

log(|D f n(x)|)(cid:27) . By the Oseledec’s

Theorem µ(R f ) = 1, for every borelian probability and f −invariant measure µ.
Denote by Per( f ) the set of all periodic points of a map f.

The main results of this paper are the followings.

Theorem A. Let f
map with degree d ≥ 2. The map f
Ed(x) = dx(mod1), d ≥ 2, if and only if λ f (p) = λ f (q) for every p, q ∈ Per( f ).

: S1 → S1 be a Cr, r ≥ 2, orientation preserving expanding
is Cr conjugated to a linear expanding map

Theorem A is a generalization of Theorem 1.1 of [1]. We don’t need to require
that λ f (p) = log(d), for any p ∈ Per( f ), as in [1], indeed it is a consequence of
the assumption λ f to be constant on Per( f ).

Theorem B. Let f : S1 → S1 be a C1−orientation preserving expanding map with
degree d ≥ 2. If µ is a borelian invariant measure of f, then

ZS1

log(|D f (x)|)dµ(x) ≤ log(d).

Suppose that µ is an ergodic absolutely continuous invariant probability measure with
a positive and continuous density ω f . The equality

ZS1

log(|D f (x)|)dµ(x) = log(d)

holds if and only if f is C1 conjugated with Ed.

Remark 1.2. We must to mention that, C1−generically, expanding maps of the
circle don’t have absolutely continuous invariant measures. It is due to a result
of Avila-Bochi in [2].

Remark 1.3. Since there are computational methods to approximate µ f , (see
for instance [6]), Theorem B can be seen as criteria to verify the regularity (or
absolute continuity) of conjugacies.

The next theorem concerns on the rigidity in two dimension setting. We give
necessary and suﬃcient conditions to an absolutely continuous conjugacy h to
be a C1,1 conjugacy, where h being C1,1 it means that h is C1 and Dh is Lipschitz.
Consider the 2-torus T2 = S1 × S1, equipped with a probability measure

m = m1 × m2, where mi, i = 1, 2 are the Lebesgue measure on S1.

For the statement of the next theorem we assume the results in [8] about the
m−almost everywhere diﬀerentiability of absolutely continuous functions in
several variables.

Theorem C. Let f : T2 → T2 be a Cr, r ≥ 1, expanding map, absolutely continuously
conjugated by a conjugacy h to a linear expanding map F : T2 → T2, where F is diago-
nalizable with two distinct eigenvalues a, b ∈ R. Then f and F are C1,1−conjugated if
and only if there is K > 1, such that 1
K < |Dh(x) · v| < K, for m−almost everywhere
x ∈ T2 and any unity vector v ∈ TxT2, and the Oseledec invariant splitting of f admits
a uniform lipschitzian extension TxT2 = E1(x) ⊕ E2(x) on T2.

To prove the above Theorems B we use classical concepts involving metric
and topological entropy. We assume that these concepts are known, see for
instance [10].

2. Well Known Results

In this section we present some important classical results about expanding

maps of the circle, which will be useful for our purposes.

Lemma 2.1 (Bounded Distortion Lemma). Let f be a C2 expanding map of S1.
There is a constant C f ≥ 1, such that if I ⊂ S1 is an interval and f n is injective on I,
then

<

for any x, y ∈ I.

|D f n(x)|
|D f n(y)|

< C f ,

Proof. Since f is an expanding map, there are λ > 1 and C > 0 such that
|D f n(z)| > Cλn, for every z ∈ S1 and n ≥ 0.

Consider x, y ∈ I and denote xi = f i(x), yi = f i(y). So we have

(cid:3)

Theorem 2.2. Any C2−expanding map f : S1 → S1 has a unique absolutely continu-
ous invariant probability measure, µ f , given by a continuous positive density denoted
by ω f . Furthermore, µ f is ergodic.

For a proof, see [5], page 193.

Theorem 2.3 (Sackesteder [11], Krzyzewski-Szlenk [7]). Let f : M → M be a
Cr, r ≥ 2, expanding map. Then there is a unique normalized Cr−1 invariant measure
for f.

2.1. Another Proof of a Shub-Sullivan’s Theorem. It is a well known result
on expanding maps of the circle. Here we provide another proof of Theorem
2.4 based on a similar argument involving ordinary diﬀerential equations that
appears in [3].
Theorem 2.4 (Shub-Sullivan, [12]). Let f, g be two Cr, r ≥ 2, orientation preserving
expanding map of the circle. Then f and g are absolutely continuous conjugated if and
only if f and g are Cr conjugated.

Proof. Let µ f and µg be the unique absolutely continuous invariant probability
measures on the circle for f and g respectively. Let ω f and ωg be the positive
densities of µ f and µg respectively. Since the conjugacy h is absolutely contin-
uous, the measure h∗µ f is a probability invariant measure for g, moreover, h∗µ f
is absolutely continuous. By the uniqueness established in Theorem 2.2, we
have h∗µ f = µg.

Since h is an absolutely continuous homeomorphism, there is h′ for almost

every point x ∈ S1. So using the change of variable formula, we have:

ZI

ω f (x)dx = Zh(I)

d(h∗µ f ) = Zh(I)

ωgdx = ZI

ωg(h(x))|h′(x)|dx,

for any interval I ⊂ S1.

So we have ω f (x) = ωg(h(x))|h′(x)|, for almost everywhere x ∈ S1.
Since f, g have the same orientation, then h is not reverse wise, then h′ > 0.
So for almost everywhere t ∈ S1, the function h satisﬁes the general ordinary
diﬀerential equation in t ∈ S1

z′ =

ω f (t)
ωg(z)

.

(2.1)

By Theorem 2.3, the densities ω f and ωg are Cr−1 functions. So considering
general equation (2.1) for every t ∈ S1, by classical theory of ordinary diﬀerential

SOME REMARKS ON EXPANDING MAPS.

equations, the O.D.E above has a unique Cr solution H satisfying H(0) = h(0),
which also satisﬁes the integral equation:

H(t) = h(0) +Z t

0

ω f (s)

ωg(H(s))

Since h has bounded variation, for every t ∈ S1 we have

h(t) = h(0) +Z t

0

h′(s)ds = h(0) +Z t

ωg(h(s))

on the other hand, by Picard’s Theorem, the function H is the unique continuous
function satisfying the above integral equation with the initial condition H(0) =
h(0). Then, by a continuation argument, H(t) = h(t), for every t.

(cid:3)

3. Consequences of the Approach Applied to Prove Theorem 2.4

Corollary 3.1. Let f : S1 → S1 be a C1−orientation preserving expanding map with
degree d. Suppose that the maximal entropy measure µ f of f is absolutely continuous
with respect to m with a Ck, k ≥ 0, positive density. Then f is a C1+k expanding map.

Proof. Let h : S1 → S1 be the conjugacy between Ed and f, we have

h ◦ f ◦ h−1 = Ed,

if we prove h is a C1+k−diﬀeomorphism, the statement of the corollary holds.

We know that m is the maximal entropy measure for Ed. Since the maximal
entropy measure for expanding maps exists and it is unique and the conjugacy
preserves maximal entropy measure, it implies that

h∗µ f = m.

Since ω f is positive, we have h is an absolutely continuous conjugacy. Fol-
lowing the same idea of the previous proof (of Theorem 2.4), with g = Ed, we
obtain that h satisﬁes the equation

z′ = ω f (t), ω f ∈ Ck(S1).

Thus, the conjugacy is the unique primitive of ω f such that z(0) = h(0), which
is C1+k.

(cid:3)

Remark 3.2. From the above corollary we observe that if the maximal entropy
measure of an orientation preserving expanding map f is m, then f is conju-
gated with Ed by a rotation. It is because the equation that deﬁnes h is h′ = 1.

Corollary 3.3. Let f : S1 → S1 be a Cr, r ≥ 2, orientation preserving expanding map.
Consider ρ : S1 → R, a C1−positive and normalized function on S1, where normalized

ρdm = 1. Then there is a C2 expanding map g : S1 → S1 conjugated to f,

means ZS1

dµg
dm

such that

= ρ.

Proof. To ﬁnd the desired expanding map g, we consider the equation in S1

z′ =

ω f (t)
ρ(z)

, z(0) = 0.

The solution h of this equation is a C2−diﬀeomorphism of S1. We consider
g = h ◦ f ◦ h−1. Evidently g is C2 and by chain rule g also is an expanding map.
By construction, since h is absolutely continuous, h∗µ f = µg, moreover, this
equation leads us to

h′(t) =

ω f (t)
ρ(h(t))

=

ω f (t)

ωg(h(t))

, t ∈ S1,

thus ρ(t) = ωg(t) =

dµg
dm

(t), t ∈ S1.

(cid:3)

Example 1. We will construct a Cr, r ∈ [2, +∞], expanding map of S1 that is
m−preserving but it is not absolutely continuous conjugated to Ed.

Consider Ed and f : S1 → S1 a small perturbation of Ed in the C1 topology such that
f (0) = 0 and D f (0) , d. The map f can be chosen Cr, r ∈ [2, +∞]. Since D f (0) , d,
then f and Ed can not be conjugated by an absolutely continuous (consequently Cr)
conjugacy. Using Corollary 3.3 we obtain a Cr expanding map g of the circle that
preserves m = µg. We have hm(g) = hµ f ( f ) < log(d), see Corollary 4.4. Thus g is
a Cr, r ∈ [2, +∞], expanding map of S1 that is m−preserving but it is not absolutely
continuous conjugated to Ed.

4. Proof of Theorems A, B and C

4.1. Proof of Theorem A.

Proof. Since the degree of f is d ≥ 2 we know that f is conjugated to Ed(x) =
dx(mod1). Fix the notation: log(λ), λ > 1, denoting the Lyapunov exponent on
periodic points. In particular if p has period n, then

|D f n(p)| = λn.

Fix n > 1 and {In, j}dn
j=1 maximal intervals of injectivity of f n, such that f n(In, j) =
S1, j = 1, 2 . . . , dn. By conjugacy with Edn, in each In, j, there is a periodic point
pn, j, f n(pn, j) = pn, j.

Denote by |I| the size of the oriented interval I ⊂ S1. By bounded distortion

lemma we have that there is C > 1, such that

|D f n(pn, j)| · |In, j| ≤ |S1| = 1 ≤ C|D f n(pn, j)| · |In, j|,

conjugacy, consequently an absolutely continuous conjugacy, which it is Cr by
Theorem 2.4.

The equality λ f (p) = λ f (q) for any p, q ∈ Per( f ) is obvious when f and Ed are

Cr−conjugated.

(cid:3)

8

F. MICENA

Corollary 4.1. Let f : S1 → S1 be a Cr, r ≥ 2, orientation preserving, with degree
d ≥ 2. Then f is Cr conjugated to Ed if and only if R f = S1.

Proof. Of course if f and Ed are Cr conjugated then R f = S1. On the other hand,
suppose that R f = S1, we claim: λ f is constant on Per( f ). In fact, suppose
that the Lyapunov exponent is not constant on Per( f ). Let λ f (p) , λ f (q) be
two diﬀerent Lyapunov exponents at periodic points p and q. Then using the
’symbolic representation’ it is possible to obtain x ∈ S1 for which there are two
subsequences {nk}k≥1 and {mk}k≥1 such that

it can be made alternating increasing periodic blocks corresponding to p and q,
thus the point x < R f .
(cid:3)

Let f, g : S1 → S1 be two Cr, r ≥ 2, orientation preserving expanding map

with same degree d ≥ 2.

Question 1. Let h be the conjugacy between f and g, that is, (h ◦ f = g ◦ h). If
h(R f ) = Rg, then is h a Cr− conjugacy

4.2. Proof of Theorem B.

Proof. Using the Jensen inequality we have

ZS1

log |D f (x)|dµ(x) ≤ log ZS1

|D f (x)|dµ! .

(4.4)

If Ii = 1, . . . , d is an interval of a Markov partition of f and gi is the respective

inverse branch, then

ZIi

|D f (x)|dµ(x) = Zgi(S1)

|D f (gi(y))|dµ(gi(y)),

using change of variables we have

Zgi(S1)

|D f (gi(y))|dµ(gi(y)) = ZS1

|D f (x)| · |Dgi(y)|dµ(x),

since |D f (x)| · |Dgi(y)| = 1 we have that the integral above is equal to 1.

Thus, varying i = 1, . . . , d we have

ZS1

|D f (x)|dµ(x) = d.

SOME REMARKS ON EXPANDING MAPS.

9

By the inequality in (4.4), we haveRS1 log |D f (x)|dµ(x) ≤ log(d).

We remember the Rokhlin’s formula for metric entropy of a C1−expanding

map of S1 preserving a borelian probability measure µ, given by

hµ( f ) = ZS1

log(|D f (x)|)dµ(x).

(4.5)

Now suppose that µ is an absolutely continuous probability measure, invari-

ant by f, with a positive continuous density ω f and hµ( f ) = ZS1

log(|D f (x)|)dµ(x) =

log(d). We have that the measure µ is the unique maximal entropy measure for
f. Let h be the conjugacy between f and Ed, then h∗µ = m, since ω f is positive,
it implies that h is absolutely continuous. As in Corollary 3.1, the conjugacy h
is a solution of

z′ = ω f (t), t ∈ S1,

since ω f is continuous, the solution of the equation above is C1.

Now suppose that f and Ed are C1 conjugated by a conjugacy h. Since h
is C1 and m is ergodic for Ed, it implies that the measure ν := (h−1)∗m is an
ergodic absolutely continuous invariant probability measure for f. We have
that µ and ν are equivalent ergodic absolutely continuous measures for f. Then
their basins have non empty intersection, it implies that µ = ν, consequently

log(d) = hν( f ) = hµ( f ) = ZS1
Remark 4.2. The inequality ZS1

log(|D f (x)|)dµ(x).

log(|D f (x)|)dµ(x) ≤ log(d) is trivial by using

(cid:3)

Rokhlin’s Formula and Variational Principle. For such purpose, here we prefer
to use more elementary tools.

Corollary 4.3. Consider f : S1 → S1 a Cr, r ≥ 2, orientation preserving expanding

map with degree d ≥ 2. ThenZS1

holds if and only if f is Cr conjugated to Ed.

log(|D f (x)|)dµ f (x) ≤ log(d). Moreover, the equality

Proof. The inequality ZS1

log(|D f (x)|)dµ f (x) ≤ log(d) follows direct from Theo-

rem B. Since µ f is ergodic, also, by Theorem B, the equality holds if and only if
the conjugacy h is C1. Finally h is C1 if and only if is Cr, by Theorem 2.4.

Corollary 4.4. Let f be a Cr, r ≥ 2 orientation preserving expanding map of the circle,
with deg( f ) = d ≥ 2. The following statements are equivalents:

(1) f is Cr conjugated to Ed(x) := dx(mod1),

(cid:3)

10

F. MICENA

(2) λ f is constant on Per( f ),
(3) λ f (p) = log(d), for every p ∈ Per( f ),
(4) R f = S1
(5) λ f (x) = log(d), for m− a.e. x ∈ S1.
(6) µ f is the maximal entropy measure for f.

Proof. From the proof of Theorem A and Corollary 4.1, we have (1) ⇒ (2) ⇒
(3) ⇒ (2) ⇒ (1), and (4) ⇒ (2) ⇒ (1) ⇒ (4).

Also, assuming (1), we have h∗m is absolutely continuous and it is the max-
imal entropy measure for f. By uniqueness of both (absolutely continuous in-
variant measure and maximal entropy measure) we have h∗m = µ f . So (1) ⇒ (6).
By Pesin’s formula (6) ⇒ (5) and by Theorem B we have (5) ⇒ (1).

(cid:3)

4.3. Proof of Theorem C. In this subsection, we use the concept of n−absolute
continuity that appears in [8], for simplicity, in the present section, we write
absolutely continuous to mean a 2−absolutely continuous function. For more
details of absolute continuity in higher dimensions we refer [8] and references
therein. Particularly, in the sense that we are assuming, absolute continuity im-
plies diﬀerentiability m−almost everywhere and the derivative of an absolutely
continuous fuction is a L2(T2, m) function.

An important tool to prove Theorem C, is the Journ´e’s Theorem, [4].

Theorem 4.5 (Journ´e’s Theorem). Let F1 and F2 be transverse foliations of a mani-
fold M whose leaves are uniformly Cr. Let ψ : M → R be any continuous function
such that the restriction of ψ to the leaves of F1 is uniformly Cr and the restriction of
ψ to the leaves of F2 is uniformly Cr. Then ψ is Cr, with estimates on the Cr norm that
are uniform in the estimates along the leaves of F1 and F2.

: T2 → T2 be a Cr, r ≥ 1, expanding map,
Theorem 4.6 (Theorem C). Let f
absolutely continuously conjugated by a conjugacy h to a linear expanding map F :
T2 → T2, where F is diagonalizable with two distinct eigenvalues a, b ∈ R. Then f
and F are C1,1−conjugated if and only if there is K > 1, such that 1
K < |Dh(x) · v| < K,
for m−almost everywhere x ∈ T2 and any unity vector v ∈ TxT2, and the Oseledec
invariant splitting of f admits a uniform lipschitzian extension TxT2 = E1(x) ⊕ E2(x)
on T2.

Remark 4.7. If the Oseledec splitting is E1(x) ⊕ E2(x) at x ∈ R f , the hypothesis
of the above Theorem means that x 7→ Ei(x), x ∈ R f , induces a lipschitzian
oriented and unity vector ﬁeld Xi on T2, for i = 1, 2 and X1, X2 are transversal.
Proof. Consider v1 and v2 non null eigenvectors of F, corresponding to the
eigenvalues a and b respectively. First we prove that for m− almost everywhere
x ∈ T2 we have Dh(x) · vi is an invariant direction of the Oseledec splitting for
f at the point h(x).

SOME REMARKS ON EXPANDING MAPS.

Consider D the set of points of T2, such that h is diﬀerentiable. Take A =
F−n(D), by construction we have that h is diﬀerentiable on the positive orbit

\n≥0

{Tn(x)}n≥0, for any x ∈ A, and m(A) = 1.

Step 1: Dh(x) sends the Oseledec splitting of F to the Oseledec splitting

of f, for m− almost everywhere x ∈ T2.

Since h is the conjugacy we have h ◦ Fn = f n ◦ h, for any n ∈ Z, so for x ∈ A,

we have

so

thus

Dh(Fn(x)) · Fn(x) · v1 = D f n(h(x)) · [Dh(x) · v1],

log(||D f n(h(x)) · [Dh(x) · v1]||) = log(|a|),

log(||D f n(h(x)) · [Dh(x) · v2]||) = log(|b|),

Thus we can deﬁne Ei(h(x)) = hDh(x) · vii, i = 1, 2 and x ∈ A.

Step 2: The Conjugacy h is C1,1.
We denote T2 = S1 × S1, the measure mi is the Lebesgue measure in the
i−coordinate. The Lebesgue measure m on T2 is the product measure m1 × m2.
The Oseledec splitting E1(x) ⊕ E2(x) at x ∈ R f , is such that x 7→ Ei(x), x ∈ R f ,
induces a Lipschitz oriented and unity vector ﬁeld Xi on T2, for i = 1, 2 and the
vector ﬁelds X1, X2 are uniformly transversal.

It is known from [8] that h is diﬀerentiable m almost everywhere point, |Dh|2
is integrable, which implies that |Dh| is integrable, by the natural inclusion
L2(T2, m) ⊂ L1(T2, m). Since m(A) = m(RT) = m(A ∩ RT) = 1, we can suppose
that every point in A is regular.

Consider U ⊂ T2 a non empty and connected open set. By a linear change
of basis, we can consider that the invariant directions of F are the canonical
vectors e1 and e2. We denote FH and FV the foliations given by linear segments
in the directions e1 and e2. The foliations FH and FV are called horizontal and
vertical foliations. The leaf FH(x) is the leaf of FH through x, restricted to U
and FV(x) is the leaf of FV through x, restricted to U. Finally we can suppose
U is such that its boundary is given by the union of segments of leaves of the
horizontal and vertical foliations.

12

F. MICENA

Let us consider local coordinates (z, t), it means z ∈ FH(x0) and t ∈ FV(x0),
such that x0 := (z0, t0) ∈ U. Also, we can denote m by dzdt. Let us to denote the
neighborhood U by the product U = [Z0, Z1] × [τ0, τ1].

The foliation FV is absolutely continuous, it means that for m1 almost every-
where z in the ﬁrst coordinate, the leaf FV(z, t) intersects A in a m2 full measure
set. Since Dh is an isomorphism in m−almost everywhere point, then, for
m−almost everywhere x = (z, t) ∈ FV(x) ∩ A, we have that the derivative with
respect to the variable t, denoted by ˙h(z, t) := ∂2h(z, t) = Dh(z, t) · e2, it satisﬁes
h ˙h(z, t)i = Dh(z, t) · [TxFV(x)] = E2(h(x)), by step 1.

Fix z as above, such that the leaf FV(z, t) intersects A in a m2 full measure set.
The topological arc h(FV(z, t)) is tangent to X2(h(x)) for m2−almost everywhere
t. Consider the length arc

the function s(t) is a bounded, since we are supposing 1
K < |h′(x) · v| ≤ K, for
m−almost everywhere x ∈ T2 and any unity vector v ∈ TxT2. Moreover, the
function s is increasing in the variable t. In fact, consider an ε > 0, such that

s(t + ε) − s(t) = Z t+ε

By classical analysis, since s is lipschitizan, then s is diﬀerentiable for m2−almost

everywhere t ∈ [τ0, τ1]. The inverse t(s) is also an increasing and bi-lipschitzian
surjective map t : [0, L] → [τ0, τ1], similarly, it is diﬀerentiable for Lebesgue
almost every point s ∈ [0, L], where L = Lz depends on the corrdinate z, which
is ﬁxed.

For m2−almost everywhere t, we have s′(t) = | ˙h(z, t)|. In fact, since s is an

where s we have |∂sβ(z, s)| = 1, and the tangent vector at β(z, s) = h(z, t(s)) is a
unity vector of the ﬁeld X2, it means

˙β(z, s) = ±X2(β(z, s)).

By continity of h, we can take X2 such that

˙β(z, s) = X2(β(z, s)),

for m1−almost everywhere ﬁrst coordinate z and almost everywhere s ∈ [0, L].
For the z ﬁxed, consider γ(z, s) the curve given by γ(z, 0) = β(z, 0) and ˙γ(z, s) :=
X2(β(z, s)). Note that the ˙γ is uniformly continuous, it implies that the derivative
dβ
ds (z, s) can be C1− extended to [0, L]. We claim β(z, s) is C1 and ˙β(z, s) = X2(β(z, s))
for any s ∈ [0, L].

Let s0 ∈ [0, L] and consider the ratio

By Picard’s Theorem, there is a unique solution for the equation above, which

is C1,1, since we are supposing X2 a lipschitzian unity vector ﬁeld.

mean h(z, t) in the below lines.

Doing n → +∞ expression (4.7) is equal to zero and the limit in the expression

So

Since the sequence tn → t0 is arbitrary, the number L is in fact well deﬁned
Indeed, since h(z, t) is diﬀeretiable in t and h(z, t(s)) is
by the limit above.
diﬀerentiable in s, an easy calculus allows us to conclude that t(s) and s(t) are
diﬀerentiable functions.

We have

˙h(z, t) = s′(t)X2(β(t(s))),

where 1

K < |s′| < K, the vector ﬁeld X2 is Lipschitz and β(t(s)) is C1,1, so ˙h(z, t)

We have h(z, t) is uniformly Lipschitz for m1−almost everywhere ﬁrst coor-

dinate z. Let zn → z0 in U, then by uniform continuity of h, we have

is a C1,1 function restricted to FV(z0, τ0).

Thus conjugacy h restricted to the vertical foliation is uniform C1,1 on each
leaf of FV. An analogous argument leads us to conclude that the conjugacy
h restricted to each leaf of FH is uniform C1,1. Since FV and FH are uniform
transverse C∞ foliations, then by Journ´e’s Theorem, h is C1,1 restricted to U. As
the neighborhood U is arbitrary, then h is C1,1 on T2. Particularly f, initially
supposed C1, is in fact C1,1.

Directly from the ideas to prove Theorem C, we can prove in S1.

Corollary 4.8. Let f : S1 → S1 be a Cr, r ≥ 1, expanding map, absolutely continuously
conjugated by a conjugacy h to a linear expanding map Ed : S1 → S1, d ≥ 2. Then f
and Ed are C1,1−conjugated if and only they are bi-Lipschitz conjugated (with positive
bi-Lipschitz constants).

Proof. In fact, denoting h : S1 → S1, the conjugacy between f and Ed, we have
that there is K ≥ 1, such that

1
K

||x − y|| ≤ ||h(x) − h(y)|| ≤ K||x − y||,

for any x, y ∈ S1.

K

Since h is bi-Lipschitz, then h is m− almost everywhere diﬀerentiable and
≤ |Dh(x)| ≤ K, for m− almost everywhere x ∈ S1.
We don’t need suppose a Lipschitz extension of the Oseledec splitting for
f, because we are leading with dim(TxM) = 1, for any x ∈ S1. The functions
h(z, t(s)), β(z, s) and h(z, t) in this case they become h(t(s)), β(t(s)) and h(t) respec-
tively. The veriﬁcation of the C1,1 diﬀerentiability of these function, we make
as in the previous Theorem. The statement is proven. Particularly f, initially
supposed C1, is in fact C1,1.

Corollary 4.9 (Theorem C for equal eigenvalues). Let f : T2 → T2 be a Cr, r ≥ 1,
expanding map, absolutely continuously conjugated by a conjugacy h to a linear
expanding map F : T2 → T2, where F is diagonalizable with two equal eigenvalues.
Then f and F are C1,1−conjugated if and only if there is K > 1, such that 1
K < |Dh(x)·v| <
K, for m−almost everywhere x ∈ T2 and any unity vector v ∈ TxT2, and there are

linearly independent invariant diretions v1, v2 for F, such that Dh(x) · vi, i = 1, 2 induce
a Oseledec invariant splitting TT2 = E1 ⊕ E2 of f, which can be lipschitzian extended
to transversal direction ﬁelds on T2.

The proof follows in the same lines of Theorem C.
A minor variation in the proof of the Theorem C allows us to prove.

Theorem 4.10. Let f : Tk → Tk, k ≥ 2, be a Cr, r ≥ 1, expanding map, absolutely
continuously conjugated by a conjugacy h to a linear expanding map F : Tk → Tk,
where F is diagonalizable with k distinct eigenvalues a1, . . . , ak ∈ R. Then f and F
are C1,1−conjugated if and only if there is K > 1, such that 1
K < |Dh(x) · v| < K,
for m−almost everywhere x ∈ Tk and any unity vector v ∈ TxTk, and the Oseledec
invariant splitting of f admits a uniform lipschitzian extension TxTk = E1(x) ⊕ . . . ⊕
Ek(x) on Tk.

We use the argument of Theorem C to prove that h restricted to each linear
foliation in the direction of the eigenvectors of F is C1,1, after we use inductively
the Journ´e’s Theorem to conclude that h is C1,1.
