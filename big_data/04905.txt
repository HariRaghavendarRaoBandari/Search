Abstract. We study an initial value problem for the Toda lattice with almost periodic initial
data. We consider initial data for which the associated Jacobi operator is absolutely continuous
and has a spectrum satisfying a Craig-type condition, and show the boundedness and almost
periodicity in time and space of solutions.

Toda was not the ﬁrst to explore solid models with nearest-neighbor interactions. Notably, in
numerical experiments, Fermi, Pasta, and Ulam observed a surprising characteristic of systems
deﬁned by Hamiltonians with polynomial interaction terms: that, rather than thermalizing to an
equilibrium state, the particles asymptotically tended to almost periodic solutions in time [10]. We
intend to explore this same phenomenon rigorously for the Toda lattice (1.4).

The formulation of the system described by (1.4) as (1.1), (1.2) follows from the change of variables

due to Flaschka [11] given by

(qn+1 − qn)),

Flaschka’s variables demonstrate that the Toda lattice is the discrete analogue of the Korteweg-de
Vries equation [17] in the sense that the system (1.1), (1.2) can be expressed equivalently as a Lax
pair [18]

J(t) = [P (t), J(t)]

and

(J(t)u)n = an−1(t)un−1 + bn(t)un + an(t)un+1

(P (t)u)n = −an−1(t)un−1 + an(t)un+1.

Systems with a Lax pair formulation are often described as completely integrable; indeed, it easily
follows from (1.5) that the operators J(t) are mutually unitarily equivalent, which can be used to
extract conserved quantities. This is particularly convenient for the periodic Toda lattice, which is a
ﬁnite dimensional integrable system in which a maximal set of conserved quantities can be obtained
as traces of powers of J(t) [31]. In the aperiodic case considered in this paper, one cannot rely on
this method. Indeed, proving stronger statements of integrability is a problem highly dependent on
the type of initial data considered.

In the context of the KdV equation, Deift [8] posed an open problem whether, for almost periodic
initial data, solutions to the KdV equation were almost periodic in the time variable. In [1], this
question is partially answered in the aﬃrmative; namely, that for small, quasi-periodic analytic
initial data at Diophantine frequency, unique solutions exist and are almost periodic in time. In
this paper, we consider the analogous question for the Toda lattice (posed, e.g., in [1]): for almost
periodic initial data (˜a, ˜b), is it true that the solution to (1.1), (1.2), (1.3) is almost periodic in
the time variable t? Our main theorem provides suﬃcient spectral conditions on the initial data to
guarantee this indeed occurs.

We now describe an aspect of these spectral conditions. Denote by J0 = J(0) the Jacobi operator
corresponding to the initial data ˜a, ˜b. The spectrum E = σ(J0) is compact, and can thus be written

E = [E, E] \ [j∈I

(E−

j , E+
j )

for an appropriate (at most countable) indexing set I. Here, E = inf E, E = sup E, and (E−
are the bounded maximal open intervals in R \ E, called gaps. Denote the gap lengths by

It will be important for our spectrum to satisfy conditions analogous to that of Craig [2]. If we
denote

(1.7)

Heuristically, this condition guarantees that relatively large gaps of the spectrum do not accumulate.
In this context, we have a suﬃcient condition which demonstrates the time-and-space almost

periodicity of the associated solution:

Theorem 1.1. Let the initial data J0 = (˜a, ˜b) be almost periodic. Denote E = σ(J0), and assume
that E = σac(J0) and E satisﬁes (1.7). Then:

(1) the unique solution (a, b)(t) of the initial value problem (1.1),(1.2),(1.3) is bounded in time;
(2) the solution is almost periodic in t, in the sense that there is a continuous map

M : TI → ℓ∞(Z) × ℓ∞(Z),

a point ω ∈ TI , and a direction ζ ∈ RI such that (a, b)(t) = M(ω + ζt);

(3) for each t ∈ R, the associated Jacobi operator J(t) is almost periodic with frequency module

equal to the frequency module of J0.

The proof of this theorem relies heavily on the previous work establishing analogous results for
quasi-periodic initial data with ﬁnite-gap spectra; these results are collected in, e.g., [12]. It also
relies on the inverse spectral-theoretic works of Remling [22, 23] and Sodin-Yuditskii [27, 28]. These
results and their relevance will be discussed in further detail later in the paper.

On comparison with the continuum analogue [1], one may notice that the application to small
quasiperiodic initial data [1, Theorem 1] is conspicuously absent. The proof of this application was
due in large part to extensive machinery developed in [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] for the continuum Schr¨odinger
operator. The importance of this machinery is that it provides a direct spectral criterion guaranteeing
that the analogue of (1.7) is satisﬁed. With this in mind, we remark that the analogue of [1, Theorem
1] is very likely true in the Toda lattice case, pending a number of discrete analogues to continuum
results. One would then apply comparable results to [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] to small quasi-periodic initial
data J0 to verify this assumption, consequently concluding time almost periodicity. Proving these
discrete analogues, however, seems an undertaking well beyond the scope of this paper.

The paper will be structured as follows: in Section 2, we establish some deﬁnitions and notation
and review some fundamental results in inverse spectral theory. In Section 3, we review the cocycle
representation of the Toda ﬂow and describe the time evolution of the Weyl M -matrix. Section 4
addresses perhaps the primary diﬃculty by demonstrating that the Dirichlet data corresponding to
the Toda ﬂow do not pause at the edges of gaps. In Section 5, we prove a relation describing the
Toda ﬂow on the Dirichlet data; in particular, we prove that the Dirichlet data ﬂow in a diﬀerentiable
manner with respect to a Lipschitz vector ﬁeld. Finally, Section 6 addresses the linearization of the
Toda ﬂow under the Abel map, and contains the proof of Theorem 1.1. For the curious reader, we
have also appended a number of useful facts pertaining to the Sodin-Yuditskii inversion approach;
namely, that our condition (1.7) implies Carleson homogeneity (Appendix A) and everywhere-zero
Lyapunov exponents in the Sodin-Yuditskii regime (Appendix B).

2. Background and Notation

We consider bounded Jacobi operators, which are operators J = J(a, b) on ℓ2(Z) parametrized

by a pair of bounded, real-valued sequences a, b ∈ ℓ∞(Z) as follows:

(Ju)n = anun+1 + bnun + an−1un−1.

(2.1)

Jacobi operators arise naturally in the context of the spectral theorem: any bounded self-adjoint
operator A with a cyclic vector is unitarily equivalent to a Jacobi operator on a half-line. They also
correspond closely to orthogonal polynomials on the real line and generalize discrete one-dimensional
Schr¨odinger operators (for which an = 1 for all n ∈ Z). We restrict to the non-singular case, where
an > 0 for all n ∈ Z.

It is easy to see that, under these conditions, J is a bounded self-adjoint operator. The spectrum
σ(J) is the set of z ∈ C for which J − z does not have a bounded inverse operator (J − z)−1 :
ℓ2(Z) → ℓ2(Z). Because J is self-adjoint, σ(J) ⊂ R, and because J is bounded, σ(J) is compact.

Associated to each Jacobi operator J is its resolvent, (J −z)−1, which (by deﬁnition) is a bounded
operator for z ∈ C \ σ(J), the resolvent set. This operator can likewise be put in a matrix form,
with elements given by

r(n, m; J, z) = hδn, (J − z)−1δmi

(2.2)

We write r(n; J, z) := r(n, n; J, z) for the diagonal elements of the resolvent matrix, and r(J, z) :=
r(0; J, z) for the spectral theoretic Green’s function of J. This function is holomorphic on the
resolvent set ρ(J) := C \ σ(J).

For ψ ∈ ℓ2(Z), the spectral measure dµψ is the unique measure on R with the property that

hψ, (J − z)−1ψi =Z

1

x − z

dµψ(x), ∀z ∈ C \ R.

(2.3)

Spectral measures are always supported on the spectrum. Using the Lebesgue decomposition of
dµψ = dµψ,ac + dµψ,s, the absolutely continuous spectrum σac(J) can be deﬁned as the smallest
common topological support of absolutely continuous parts of all spectral measures,

σac(J) = [ψ∈ℓ2(Z)

supp dµψ,ac.

Clearly, σac(J) ⊂ σ(J). We will focus on cases where σac(J) = σ(J).

For each z /∈ σ(J), the diﬀerence equation Ju = zu has nontrivial (formal) solutions u±(J; z),
called Weyl solutions, such that u±(J; z) ∈ ℓ2(Z±). The Weyl solutions are clearly linearly indepen-
dent, and thus span the 2-dimensional solution space ker(J − z). Furthermore, they are unique up
to a multiplicative constant. For simplicity of notation, we write

V±(J; z) =(cid:20)

u±(J; z)(1)

a0(J)u±(J; z)(0)(cid:21) .

The resolvent function then satisﬁes the important relation

r(n, m; J, z) =

u±(n)u∓(m)
W (u−, u+)

,

where ±1 = sgn(n − m) and W (u−, u+) = a0(u−(0)u+(1) − u−(1)u+(0)) denotes the Jacobi Wron-
skian.

In terms of the Weyl solutions, one can express the half-line m-functions by

m±(J; z) = ∓

u±(J; z)(1)

a0(J)u±(J; z)(0)

.

These functions are the half-line analogues of the spectral Green’s function. For ﬁxed J, these are
meromorphic functions of z ∈ C \ E which analytically map the upper half-plane to itself.

(2.5)

It can be shown that r(J, z) has at most one simple zero µj ∈ (E−
j ) for each j ∈ I. When such
a zero exists, it is likewise a pole of exactly one of m±(J; z). Write σj = ±1 in this case. More
precisely, ﬁxing J and observing that r(n, n; z) is strictly increasing for z ∈ (E−

In the ﬁrst case, the sign σj is deﬁned so that mσj has a pole at µj; in the latter two cases, we

Dirichlet data of J.

and vector ﬁelds on D(E) will be equipped with the sup-norm obtained from (2.9). Denote the map
taking a Jacobi operator (a, b) to its Dirichlet data at the origin by B:

B((a, b)) := ϕ(0).

(2.10)

We introduce a vector ﬁeld Ψ via

(cid:17)

We will soon see that this vector ﬁeld describes the Toda ﬂow in the discrete case. Craig initially
proposed a similar vector ﬁeld to describe the translation ﬂow in the continuum case [2]. Roughly
speaking, Ψj(ϕ) is the residue of (r(J, z))−1 at µj. This is not quite true in general – r(J, z) does
not have proper zeroes at the gap edges – but at least motivates the deﬁnition.

To ensure that the vector ﬁeld Ψ is Lipschitz, we also enforce condition (1.7) on E. This condition
prevents relatively large gaps from accumulating at a gap edge; we show this is analogous to Craig’s
conditions [2, Theorem 6.2] in Lemma 5.1.

We are interested particularly in the class of Jacobi operators which can be completely recovered

from their Dirichlet data. To this end, we introduce the following

ALMOST PERIODICITY IN TIME OF SOLUTIONS OF THE TODA LATTICE

6

Deﬁnition 2.1. Let E ⊂ R. A Jacobi operator J is said to be reﬂectionless on E if

Re(r(J, x + i0)) = 0

(2.11)

for Lebesgue almost every x ∈ E.

The importance of the reﬂectionless condition is that it allows one to recover a Jacobi operator’s

resolvent r(n; z) from its spectral data {E±

j } ∪ {(µj(n), σj (n))}j∈I .

For a ﬁxed positive-measure compact set E ⊂ R, deﬁne

J (E) : = {(a, b) ∈ ℓ∞(Z) × ℓ∞(Z) : σ(J(a, b)) ⊂ E, J(a, b) is reﬂectionless on E}.

If E has |I| < ∞ gaps, J (E) can be parametrized by the real divisors on the two-sheeted genus
|I| Riemann surface ΣI covering ˆC \ E. Thus, J (E) is homeomorphic to the real Jacobian of ΣI ,
which is in turn homeomorphic (via the so-called Abel map) to a torus in |I| dimensions, TI , by the
Abel-Jacobi theorem [19].

In a remarkable paper [28], Sodin and Yuditskii showed that, if E is homogeneous in the sense
of Carleson, a generalized Abel map A gives a homeomorphism between π∗(C \ E) := Hom(π1(C \
E), T) and D(E), and the restriction B : J (E) → D(E) of (2.10) is likewise a homeomorphism.
What’s more, they provide continuous trace formulas P, Q : D(E) → R allowing recovery of the
parametrizing sequences (see Appendix B). We denote

V(ϕ) := (P(ϕ), Q(ϕ)).

(2.12)

When E is homogeneous (in the sense of Carleson), the shift action on J (E) is completely
understood: namely, shifting corresponds exactly to translation in π∗(C \ E) by the constant vector
αE. Our condition (1.7) is, in fact, stronger than homogeneity (see Appendix A); thus, for E
satisfying (1.7), we are indeed in Sodin-Yuditskii’s regime.

The idea behind the proof of Theorem 1.1 can be summarized as follows: Our assumptions allow
us to conclude that our initial data lies in J (E), that E is homogeneous, and that the trace formulas
P and Q are valid. This will suﬃce to prove (1). We use this information to pass from our initial
data to the Dirichlet data, and conclude global existence and uniqueness of the ﬂow there. To show
(2), we will approximate our inﬁnite-gap operators in Dirichlet data via lifts of ﬁnite-gap operators,
where this theorem is known, into our larger isospectral torus, and use uniform convergence to
conclude that the result must still hold. Finally, (3) comes for free as an immediate corollary of
Sodin-Yuditskii [28, Corollary of Theorem C]. The remainder of this paper is, of course, dedicated
to the details.

3. Evolution of the Weyl M-matrix Under the Toda Flow

In this section, we review a number of prior results, which can be found, for example, in [29].
Under the assumptions above, we have that J (E) is homeomorphic to a torus of some dimension.
Thus, J (E) can be naturally studied as a dynamical system. Consider an orbit {J(t)}t∈R of an
R-action on J (E). One can study these orbits by way of cocycles. By a cocycle, we mean a
matrix-valued function T : R × J (E) → SL2(C) satisfying

T (g + h, J) = T (g, J(h))T (h, J), T (0, J) = I.

(3.1)

A fundamental action on J (E) is given by conjugation by the shift operator; namely, if J = J(a, b),
we are interested in SJS∗ = J(Sa, Sb), where S : δn 7→ δn−1. We abuse notation and write SJ
for this action. By ﬁxing a solution space and canonical basis, it is possible to explicitly express S
as a cocycle. Namely, for z ∈ C, in the 2-dimensional solution space ker(J − z) ⊂ CZ we have a
correspondence of any solution to a vector in C2, given by

u ↔(cid:20) u(1)
a0u(0)(cid:21) .

The corresponding basis of solutions is given by solutions e1 and e2 such that

S(J; z) is commonly referred to as a 1-step transfer matrix. Note here we have critically used the
relation Ju = zu to collapse the solution space to two dimensions, and that an(J) 6= 0.

We intend to study a diﬀerentiable R-action on J (E) induced by the Toda lattice (1.1), (1.2).
This action, initially characterized via equations relating the positions and momenta of particles
on a line, was shown to be equivalent to a Lax pair (1.5), where J(t) = (a, b)(t) and P (t) is the
antisymmetric operator given by

(P (t)u)n = −an−1(t)un−1 + an(t)un+1.

The importance of the Lax pair formalism is that, for any solution J(t) to (1.5), for each t0, s0 ∈ R,
J(t0) is unitarily equivalent to J(s0) via a unitary propagator. We are thus interested in diﬀerentiable
solutions u(t) to J(t)u(t) = λu(t); in particular, those satisfying

∂tu(t) = P (t)u(t)

(3.6)

will be of some importance. Such solutions are uniquely determined by an initial value [29, Lemma
12.15]. In addition, we can express the ﬂow via a cocycle [23, Proposition 1.3]. The key features of
the Toda cocycle are summarized in the following

Proposition 3.1. [23, Proposition 1.3, Proposition 1.4],[21] Denote by J(t) the unique solution to
(1.1),(1.2), with initial condition J ∈ J (E). Then:

(1) J(t) ∈ J (E) for all t ∈ R.
(2) For ﬁxed z ∈ C, the action is autonomous and admits a cocycle T (·, ·; z) : R × J (E) →

SL2(C):

T (t + s, J; z) = T (t, J(s); z)T (s, J; z).

(3) T commutes with the shift action (and corresponding cocycle):

T (t, SJ; z)S(J; z) = S(J(t); z)T (t, J; z),

(4) For each z ∈ C, T (·, ·; z) properly updates the Weyl solutions satisfying (3.6):

(5) For each z ∈ R, T (t, J; z) ∈ SL2(R).

V±(J(t); z) = T (t, J; z)V±(J; z)

(3.7)

(3.8)

(3.9)

We now compute some relevant quantities relating to the evolution of this system.

Proposition 3.2. [21] For ﬁxed z ∈ C, there is a function A(·, ·; z) : R × J (E) → sl2(C) such that

given by

˙T (t, J; z) = A(t, J; z)T (t, J; z),

where J(t) = (a, b)(t) is the unique solution to (1.1),(1.2), with initial condition J ∈ J (E).

Proof. Fix z ∈ C. It is straightforward to check that

˙T (t + s, J; z)T −1(t + s, J; z) = ˙T (t, J(s); z)T −1(t, J(s); z).

Set t = 0 and take A(s, J; z) = ˙T (0, J(s); z)T −1(0, J(s); z). Clearly, A(s, J; z) ∈ sl2(C) (the tangent
space of SL2(C) at the identity); now merely substitute and verify the identity.
From [29, equation (12.56)], we have that P (t; z) := P (t)|ker(J(t)−z) satisﬁes

P (t; z) = 2a(t)S − (z − b(t)).

(3.12)

By the deﬁnition of our cocycle and the property (3.9), one sees that

with e1, e2 as deﬁned in (3.2) (3.3). The entries Aij follow from simple computations using e1, e2 ∈
ker(J(t) − z) and (3.12).
(cid:3)

A(t, J; z) =(cid:2)P (t; z)e1(J(t); z)|P (t; z)e2(J(t); z)(cid:3)

Notice that by diﬀerentiating the right-hand side of (3.9), the vector families V±(t; z) are diﬀer-

entiable in t, and satisfy

This leads to the following easy

∂tV±(t; z) = A(t, J; z)V±(t; z).

Proposition 3.3. [29, Lemma 12.15] The Wronskian W (u−, u+) is independent of time:

Deﬁne the Weyl M -matrix of a Jacobi operator as

∂tW (u−, u+) = 0.

We have the following theorem describing the time-evolution of M :

M (J, z) =(cid:20)r(1, 1; J, z)

r(0, 1; J, z)

r(1, 0; J, z)

r(0, 0; J, z)(cid:21) .

∂tM = BM + M B⊤,

where B is given by

Proof. We ﬁx z ∈ C and suppress its notation. Write

B(t; z) =(cid:20)(z − b1(t))

Remark. As noted at the beginning of this section, many of these results can be found in some
form in, e.g., [29, Chapter 12]. However, we have not seen Theorem 3.4 presented quite in this form.
The advantage of presenting the time evolution in the form of Theorem 3.4 is that this theorem is
the analogue of [24, Theorem 1].

4. The Non-Pausing of Dirichlet Data in the Non-Stationary Toda Flow

We wish to prove a Dubrovin-type evolution formula for the angular coordinates describing the
Dirichlet data of the Jacobi operators under the Toda ﬂow (1.1), (1.2). To this end, it will become
important to show that the Dirichlet data do not pause at the gap edges. As long as (a, b) is a
non-constant (i.e., non-stationary) solution, this pausing indeed does not occur. We clarify these
statements here.

The following Proposition establishes exactly the non-pausing of the Dirichlet data at gap edges

under the Toda ﬂow:

Proposition 4.1. Assume that E satisﬁes (1.7) and (a, b) : R → J (E) is a non-constant solution
satisfying (1.1),(1.2). Fix a j ∈ I and let λ ∈ {E±

j }. Then the set {t ∈ R : µj(t) = λ} is discrete.

Before proving this proposition, we need two important lemmas. The ﬁrst will show time-
invariance of subordinacy (in the sense of Gilbert and Pearson [13]); the second will demonstrate
real analyticity in time of solutions.

Lemma 4.2. Suppose (a, b) : R → ℓ∞(Z) × ℓ∞(Z) is the solution of (1.1), (1.2), and λ ∈ R. Then
subordinacy at ±∞ is time-invariant; i.e., if u0 solving J0u = λu is subordinate at ±∞, then u(t)
solving J((a, b)(t))u(t) = λu(t), ∂tu(t) = P (t)u(t), u(0) = u0 is subordinate at ±∞ for all t ∈ R.

Proof. Denote by J(t) := J((a, b)(t)) the Jacobi operator associated to (a, b)(t), ﬁx λ ∈ R, and let
K(t) = ker(J(t) − λ). We treat only the subordinacy at +∞ case, noting the −∞ case is exactly

analogous. Deﬁne a norm k · kL on St∈R K(t) by

⌊L⌋

Xj=0

kuk2

L =

|uj|2 + (L − ⌊L⌋)|u⌊L⌋+1|2,

where ⌊·⌋ denotes the typical ﬂoor function. Suppose also that u0 ∈ K := K(0) is subordinate, i.e.
for any v0 ∈ K which is linearly independent of u0,

lim
L→∞

ku0kL
kv0kL

= 0.

(4.1)

Since P is uniformly bounded operator and u is a solution of Ju = λu, there is some constant
C(t) > 0 such that |(P u)j| ≤ C(t)(|uj | + |uj+1|) for all u ∈ K(t), for all j ∈ Z. In fact, since our
parametrizing sequences a(t), b(t) are uniformly bounded in t and P depends polynomially on these
sequences, this constant C(t) is in fact uniformly bounded (say by C) in t. Thus, if u(t) ∈ K(t) is a
solution, if we write S(L, t) := ku(t)k2

L (with L ∈ Z for simplicity), then we have

|2

L

Xj=0

Re(uj(s)(P u)j(s))| ≤ 8C(S(L, t) + |uL+1(s)|2)

≤ ˜CS(L, t)

(4.2)

(4.3)

where the ﬁrst inequality in the comes from the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality and the deﬁnition of
P [29, Equation 12.96], and the second comes from the recursion relation Ju = λu and the uniform
boundedness of the parametrizing sequences (a, b).

ALMOST PERIODICITY IN TIME OF SOLUTIONS OF THE TODA LATTICE

Thus, by (4.2), we have

|

S(L, t)| = |2

Re(uj(s)(P u)j(s))|

L

Xj=0

≤ ˜CS(L, t)

and, by Gronwall’s inequality, it follows that

S(L, 0) exp(− ˜Ct) ≤ S(L, t) ≤ S(L, 0) exp( ˜Ct).

(4.4)

Suppose u(·) : R → K(·) solves ∂tu = P u, and that u0 = u(0) is subordinate at +∞. Let
vt0 ∈ K(t0) be linearly independent of u(t0). There exists a unique v(t) solving ∂tv = P v, J(t)v(t) =
λv(t) such that v(t0) = vt0 ; what’s more, this solution is linearly independent of u(t) for all time by
uniqueness of weak solutions [29, Theorem 12.5]. In particular, v0 := v(0) is linearly independent of
u0. Then, by (4.4) and subordinacy of u0,

lim
L→∞

ku(t)kL
kv(t)kL

≤ lim
L→∞

= 0

exp(2 ˜Ct)ku0kL

kv0kL

i.e., u(t) is subordinate at +∞ in K(t).

(cid:3)

Lemma 4.3. Suppose E satisﬁes (1.7). Let J(·) : R → J (E) be a solution to (1.1),(1.2), λ ∈ E,
and let u(t) solve J(t)u = λu, ∂tu(t) = P (t)u(t). Then, for ﬁxed n ∈ Z, the terms un(t) are real
analytic in t.

Proof. Because u(t) solves J(t)u = λu and ∂tu = P u, it is diﬀerentiable in t, with derivative

d
dt

un(t) = 2an(t)un+1(t) − (λ − bn(t))un(t).

(4.5)

One recursively ﬁnds that un(t) ∈ C∞(R, R). Now, to check analyticity, it suﬃces to show that

lim sup

m→∞   supt∈[−t0,t0] | dm

< ∞.

(4.6)

for each t0 > 0.

First, note that because J(t) ∈ J (E) for all t ∈ R and E is compact, the parametrizing sequences
(a, b) are uniformly bounded by some constant C. Furthermore, because (a, b) solve (1.1),(1.2), they
are smooth and have derivatives which are polynomials in a and b of total degree 2. At each step
of diﬀerentiation, the number of terms in the polynomial doubles, and the degree of each new term
increases by 1. Thus, letting D = 4C, one can then check via a straightforward induction that

k

k

dm
dtm a(t)k ≤ m!Dm+1
dm
dtm b(t)k ≤ m!Dm+1

(4.7)

(4.8)

Because E satisﬁes (1.7), E is homogeneous. It follows that the Lyapunov exponent agrees with
the value of the spectral Green’s function on E (by Proposition B.3). In particular, we have that
the Lyapunov exponent at spectral energies must be zero, i.e. the solution u can grow at most
sub-exponentially in the spatial variable n.

Equations (4.7) and (4.8) and the sub-exponential growth of the terms un combined with the
(cid:3)

diﬀerential relation (4.5) imply that (4.6) holds, and thus un(t) is indeed real analytic.

With Lemmas 4.2 and 4.3 in hand, we can address the

ALMOST PERIODICITY IN TIME OF SOLUTIONS OF THE TODA LATTICE

11

Proof of Proposition 4.1. Separating the term l = j in the product formula (2.2), we write

r(n, n; z, t) =

1

j − z)vuut
2s (µj(n, t) − z)2

j − z)(E−

(E+

1

(E − z)(E − z)Yl6=j

(µl(n, t) − z)2
l − z)(E+

l − z)

(E−

.

We can do this because (a, b) is non-constant. Note that, as z → λ, if Re(z) ∈ [E−
j ], the product
over l 6= j has a ﬁnite limit (since the lth term is bounded in modulus by 1 + γl/ηl,j). We can
therefore conclude that

j , E+

|r(n, n; λ + i0, t)| =(0

µj(n, t) = λ
+∞ µj(n, t) 6= λ

.

(4.9)

Thus, if µj(n0, t0) = λ for some (n0, t0) ∈ Z × R, we have that one of m±(λ + i0) = ∞ by
the relationship (2.4). By shifting and ﬂowing appropriately, suppose without loss of generality that
µj(0, 0) = λ. Suppose ﬁrst that m+(λ+i0) = ∞. Then, by the important inequality of Jitomirskaya-
Last [14, Theorem 1.1], [15], it follows that, up to a multiplicative constant, the solution e1(J(0); λ)
is the unique nontrivial solution subordinate at +∞ for the energy λ. Ostensibly, there may be
some t0 such that µj(0, t0) = λ and m−(λ + i0) = ∞. Again by Jitomirskaya-Last, it follows that
the solution e1(J(t0); λ) is the unique nontrivial solution subordinate at −∞ for λ. In either case,
denote by ˜u+(t) the unique weak solution ˜u+ of J(t)u = λu, ∂tu = P (t)u with ˜u+(0) = e1(J(0); λ),
and by ˜u−(t) the unique weak solution with ˜u−(t0) = e1(J(t0); λ).

Noting that subordinacy is invariant under the shift and Toda ﬂow by Lemma 4.2, then by the

uniqueness of the subordinate solution and Jitomirskaya-Last, it follows that

{t ∈ R : µj(t) = λ} ⊂ {t ∈ R : ˜u+,0(t) = 0} ∪ {t ∈ R : ˜u−,0(t) = 0},

(4.10)

where one may have to exclude one of the two sets on the right-hand side in the event the corre-
sponding solution ˜u± does not exist.

We now prove this set is discrete. By our assumptions, Lemma 4.3 applies to ˜u±, and the zeros of
˜u± are either discrete or ˜u±,0(t) = 0 for all t. Suppose we are in the latter case. Then ∂t ˜u±,0(t) = 0
for all t. But then, because ˜u±,0(t) = 0 for all t,

∂t ˜u±,0(t) = 2an(t)˜u±,1(t)

= 0

However, ˜u± is non-trivial, so ˜u±,1(t) 6= 0, and an(t) is non-zero by the non-singularity of (a, b) ∈
J (E). This is a contradiction. Thus, it follows that the set {t ∈ R : µj(t) = λ} is subset of a union
of two discrete sets, and thus is itself discrete.
(cid:3)

Remark. The thorough reader may notice that the proof of 4.1 varies signiﬁcantly from that of
its continuum analogue, [1, Proposition 2.1]. There, a critical step in the proof relied on oscillation
theory to ﬁnd a site where the Dirichlet eigenvalue µj lies within the open gap (E−
j ). We avoid
this issue completely via the non-triviality of the subordinate solution and the diﬀerential relation
∂tu = P u. However, our proof fails to show something we suspect to be true: that the “pair” u± is
in fact just one solution, subordinate at both ±∞.

5. A Dubrovin-Type Formula for the Toda Flow

We wish to implement a vector ﬁeld over D(E) which describes the time evolution of the Dirichlet

data via the Toda ﬂow. We begin by proving an analogue of [2, Theorem 6.2]:

Lemma 5.1. If E satisﬁes (1.7), then Ψ is a Lipschitz vector ﬁeld on D(E).

Proof. This proof is simply the analogue of [2, Theorem 6.2]. Recall the terms Cj from (1.6). A
simple estimate shows kΨjk∞ ≤ Cj (cf. [2, Lemma 6.1]), and thus kΨjkD(E) is ﬁnite by (1.7) (since
the ηj is uniformly bounded above, supj γ

j Cj < ∞).

We now show that the vector ﬁeld Ψ describes the Toda ﬂow on D(E):

Proposition 5.2. Suppose E satisﬁes (1.7), and let (a, b)(t) solve (1.1),(1.2), and (1.3) with (˜a, ˜b) ∈
J (E). Then, the corresponding function ϕ(t) ∈ D(E) is diﬀerentiable in t and obeys

∂tϕj(t) = Ψj(ϕ(t))

(5.2)

We prove part of this proposition away from gap edges:

Lemma 5.3. Under the assumptions of Proposition 5.2, at any t such that ϕj(t) /∈ πZ, ϕj (t) is
diﬀerentiable and obeys (5.2).

Proof. The M -matrix is analytic in z ∈ C \ E.

(5.3)

Recall that M22 is exactly the diagonal Green’s function r(J(t), z).

ALMOST PERIODICITY IN TIME OF SOLUTIONS OF THE TODA LATTICE

13

At any t such that µj(t) ∈ (E−

j , E+

j ), by applying the implicit function theorem to the relation

r(J(t), µj (t)) = 0, we have that µj(t) is diﬀerentiable, and

(5.5)

By (3.13) and (3.11), we note that

∂tM22(J(t), z)|z=µj = 2(B21M12 + B22M22)|z=µj

Thus, we obtain an expression for

(5.6)

By Proposition 5.1, we likewise ﬁnd that µj is continuous in (E−

j , E+

j ).

Next, we claim that σj (t) is constant while µj(t) ∈ (E−

j , E+

j ). Indeed,

∂t(M12(J(t), z) + M21(J(t), z)) = tr(B)(M12 + M21) + tr(M )(B12 + B21).

Thus, ∂tσj = 0 in this situation, and σj(t) is constant in t while µj(t) ∈ (E−

j ).

Remark. Note that, as a result of the a0(t) factors in the Weyl M-matrix, this aspect of the proof
varies slightly from the continuum case in [1]. Namely, diﬀerentiating the oﬀ-diagonal terms picks
up an additional summand. However, the fact that B is no longer traceless saves the day here.

Thus, from (2.7) and (2.8), we conclude that ϕj(n, t) is likewise diﬀerentiable in t, and

(cid:3)

In particular, ϕ is uniformly continuous on compacts. We can now prove Proposition 5.2:

Proof of Proposition 5.2. To show diﬀerentiability, Lemma 5.3 and Proposition 4.1 reduce the proof
to the case where ϕj (t0) ∈ πZ.

Suppose ϕj(t0) ∈ πZ. By Proposition 4.1, we can shrink ε such that {t ∈ (t0 − ε, t0 + ε) : ϕj(t) ∈
πZ} = {t0}. The remainder of the proof is straightforward. By continuity, Lemma 5.3, and the
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we have

Z t

t0

Ψj(ϕj (τ ))dτ = ϕj(t) − ϕj(t0),

t ∈ (t0, t0 + ε)

(and similarly for t ∈ (t0 − ε, t0)). Consequently, the derivative of ϕj (t) exists at t0, and

∂tϕj (t)|t=t0 = Ψj(ϕ(t0)).

This exhausts all cases, and completes the proof.

6. Linearization of the Toda Flow

In this section, we will consider the behavior of the ﬁnite-gap solutions (a, b)N to the Toda lattice
and their limit (a, b) with respect to the generalized Abel map of Sodin-Yuditskii [28], and ﬁnally
prove Theorem 1.1. To prove these facts, we will need to recall additional details from the work of
Sodin and Yuditskii [27, 28]. We assume throughout that E is homogeneous.

For what follows, we assume that the gaps of E are indexed by the positive integers, i.e. I = N.
This doesn’t reduce generality, because in the case where I is ﬁnite, these results are already known
[12]. Denote

EN = [E, E] \ [j≤N

(E−

j , E+
j )

and denote the corresponding isospectral torus by D(EN ) and corresponding trace maps V N , vector
ﬁeld ΨN , and Sodin-Yuditskii translation constant αN ∈ Γ∗

In their paper, Sodin-Yuditskii introduce functions ξj(z) for each gap (E−

j , E+

j ) of E. The map

EN .

ξj(z) is the solution of the Dirichlet problem on C \ E with boundary conditions given by

ξj (z) =(1 x ∈ E, x ≥ E+

j
0 x ∈ E, x ≤ E−
j

.

(6.1)

The regularity of E implies that ξj (z) is a continuous function on ˆC and a harmonic function on
C \ E, with values on E given by 6.1.

Let π(C \ E) be the fundamental group of C \ E. It is a free group with the set of generators given

by {cj}j∈I , where cj is a counterclockwise simple loop intersecting R at E − 1 and (E+

j + E−

j )/2.

Following Sodin-Yuditskii, consider the group π∗(C \ E) of unimodular characters of π(C \ E),
with additive notation for the composition law. An element α ∈ π∗(C \ E) is uniquely determined
by its action on loops cj, so we can write α = {αj}j∈I , where αj = α(cj ) ∈ T. Endow π∗(C \ E)
with the topology dual to the discrete topology on π(C \ E); one metric which would induce this
topology is

d(α, ˜α) =Xj∈I

min(|αj − ˜αj|, γj), α, ˜α ∈ π∗(C \ E)

where γj = E+

j − E−

j , as before. An important realization about this topology is that projections

onto the ﬁrst N coordinates converge uniformly to the identity (since P γj < ∞).

Sodin-Yuditskii deﬁne the Abel map A : D(E) → π∗(C \ E) by deﬁning its components Aj :=

Aj(cj),

Aj(ϕ) = πXk∈I

σk(ξj(µk) − ξj(E−

k )) mod 2πZ

(6.2)

where, as before, we assume µk, σk are given by ϕk as in (2.7), (2.8). They then prove the following:
(1) For each j, the sum in (6.2) converges absolutely and uniformly in ϕ ∈ D(E); in particular,

the map A is well-deﬁned.

(2) A is a homeomorphism between D(E) and π∗(C \ E) linearizing the translation ﬂow: there

exists αE ∈ π∗(C \ E) such that

A(ϕ(n)) = A(ϕ(0)) + nαE.

This, in turn, uniquely deﬁnes ϕ(n) given ϕ(0); thus, B : J (E) → D(E) is a bijection (in
fact, a homeomorphism).

ALMOST PERIODICITY IN TIME OF SOLUTIONS OF THE TODA LATTICE

15

(3) Denote by AN : D(EN ) → π∗(C \ EN ) the Abel map for EN . Project D(E) to D(EN )
by truncation and embed π∗(C \ EN ) into π∗(C \ E) by assuming αN (cj) = 0 for j > N .
With these conventions, consider AN as a map from D(E) to π∗(C \ E). Then, AN → A as
N → ∞, uniformly on D(E).

This extended Abel map A was introduced to generalize the notion of Jacobi inversion, which exists
in the ﬁnite-gap setting. We will use this language to reinterpret the Toda and translation ﬂows on
the Dirichlet data:

Lemma 6.1. Suppose E satisﬁes (1.7), and let f ∈ D(E). Then there exists a function ϕ : Z × R →
D(E) such that ϕ(0, 0) = f , and

ϕ(n + 1, t) = A−1(A(ϕ(n, t)) + α),

∂tϕ(n, t) = Ψ(ϕ(n, t)).

(6.3)

(6.4)

If we deﬁne (a, b) : Z × R → R2 by

(a, b) = V ◦ ϕ

then the function (a, b) satisﬁes (1.1),(1.2), and (1.3). Moreover, for each t ∈ R, we have (a, b)(t) ∈
J (E), and B((a, b)(t)) = ϕ(0, t).

Proof. This is an immediate corollary of the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the Toda IVP
[29, Theorem 12.6], the preservation of the reﬂection coeﬃcients under the Toda ﬂow [23, Proposition
1.4], and the work of Sodin-Yuditskii [28, Theorem C].
(cid:3)

We will prove Theorem 1.1 via approximation, and begin by constructing our ﬁnite-gap approxi-

mants. Starting from an element f ∈ D(E), observe the functions ϕN : Z × R → D(EN ) solving

∂tϕN (n, t) = ΨN (ϕN (n, t)),

ϕN (n + 1, t) = (AN )−1(AN (ϕN (n, t)) + αN )

(6.5)

(6.6)

obeying initial condition

ϕN

j (0, 0) = fj, j ≤ N.

This uniquely determines the function ϕN , by results of [12] (although condition (6.3) appears here
in a diﬀerent, but equivalent, form).

Furthermore, by [12], the function (a, b)N = V N ◦ ϕN has the following properties:
(1) For every t, J N (t) := (a, b)N (t) is almost periodic and the Jacobi operator J N (t) has spec-

trum EN .

(2) (a, b)N satisﬁes the Toda lattice (1.1),(1.2).
(3) The Dirichlet data of (a, b)N are ϕN .
Our ultimate goal will be to compare trajectories on ﬁnite-gap approximants to our isospectral

torus. To do so, we employ a lemma from [1], which we quote here for convenience:

Lemma 6.2. [1, Lemma 4.4] Assume that U , ˜U are Lipschitz vector ﬁelds on D(E), with Lipschitz
constants less than or equal to L. Consider solutions φ, ˜φ : R → D(E) of ∂tφ = U (φ), ∂t ˜φ = ˜U ( ˜φ).
Then

where m = 2L log(2) and

ALMOST PERIODICITY IN TIME OF SOLUTIONS OF THE TODA LATTICE

To apply this lemma to compare trajectories on diﬀerent isospectral tori, we lift all the ﬁelds and

solutions to D(E) as follows.

There is a natural projection πN : D(E) → D(EN ) given by

π(φ)j = φj, j ≤ N.

Lift the trace formulas to ˜V N : D(E) → R2 by

˜V N = V N ◦ π.

Introduce the vector ﬁelds ˜ΨN on D(E) by

˜ΨN

j (φ) =(ΨN

j (π(φ))

Ψj(φ)

j ≤ N
j > N.

To deﬁne ˜ϕN : Z × R → D(E), set the initial value

˜ϕN (0, 0) = f,

and ﬂow via

∂t ˜ϕN (0, t) = ˜ΨN ( ˜ϕN (0, t)), ∀t ∈ R,

˜ϕN

j (n, t) =(((AN )−1(AN ( ˜ϕN (0, t)) + nαN ))j

((A)−1(A( ˜ϕN (0, t)) + nα))j

j ≤ N
j > N

With these deﬁnitions, one can check that

ϕN = π ◦ ˜ϕN .

In particular, note that V N (ϕN ) = ˜V N ( ˜ϕN ). Here, it is important that we established that Ψ (and,
consequently, ˜ΨN ) is Lipschitz to guarantee existence and uniqueness of the functions ˜ϕN .

Finally, introduce ϕ : Z × R → D(E) by

ϕ(0, 0) = f,

ϕ(n + 1, 0) = A−1(A(ϕ(n, 0)) + α), ∀n ∈ Z

∂tϕ(n, t) = Ψ(ϕ(n, t)), ∀(n, t) ∈ Z × R.

It will become important to consider the convergence of the inverses of the ﬁnite-gap Abel maps
AN . By an abuse of notation, we will denote by (AN )−1 : π∗(C \ E) → D(E) the lift of the proper
inverse of AN , such that

((AN )−1(AN )(φ))j =(φj

0

j ≤ N
j > N

.

Under these assumptions, it is a straightforward exercise to prove

Lemma 6.3. (AN )−1 converges uniformly to A−1.

Proof. By [27, Equation (4.1.2)], convergence of AN to A is uniform, and by the deﬁnition of the
metric on π∗(C \ E) and compactness, lifted projections ˜αN of a α ∈ π∗(C \ E) likewise converge
uniformly to α. Since π∗(C \ E) is compact, A−1 is uniformly continuous.

Let ε > 0 be given, and ﬁnd the corresponding uniform δ for A−1. There exists an integer N0

such that for all N > N0, for all α ∈ π∗(C \ E), d(α, ˜αN ) < δ/2 and kAN − Ak∞ < δ/2. Then

kA(A−1(α)) − A((AN )−1(α))k ≤ kα − ˜αN k + kAN − Ak∞

< δ/2 + δ/2 = δ.

ALMOST PERIODICITY IN TIME OF SOLUTIONS OF THE TODA LATTICE

17

Consequently, by uniform continuity of A−1, for N > N0

kA−1(A(A−1(α))) − A−1(A((AN )−1(α)))k = kA−1(α) − (AN )−1(α)k

< ε,

i.e. (AN )−1 converges uniformly to A−1.

(cid:3)

Lemma 6.4. Suppose E satisﬁes (1.7), and let K > 0. Then there exists m > 0 and constants KN
such that limN→∞ KN = 0 and, for all t ∈ R,

k ˜ϕN (n, t) − ϕ(n, t)k ≤ KN em|t|.

sup
|n|≤K

(6.8)

Proof. By our assumptions on E and Lemma 5.1, Ψ is a Lipschitz vector ﬁeld. The proof of this
fact gives upper bounds for the Lipschitz constants in terms of gap sizes and distances, so it also
applies to ˜ΨN , giving uniform Lipschitz estimates in N . Denote by L such an upper bound on the
Lipschitz constant which works for all ˜ΨN and Ψ.

In particular, under these assumptions, the values ˜ϕN (0, t) and ϕ(0, t) deﬁned above are all
uniquely determined by existence and uniqueness theorems for diﬀerential equations, and conse-
quently ˜ϕN (n, t) and ϕ(n, t) are uniquely determined for each n.

One can show (cf. [1, Lemma 4.5]) that, for j ≤ N , we have

where Cj is deﬁned as in 1.6 and

kΨj − ˜ΨN

j k ≤ 2(Cj − Cj,N )

Since γj → 0, it follows that ˜KN → 0 as N → ∞.

Applying Lemma 6.2 to compare trajectories of the vector ﬁelds ˜ΨN and Ψ with initial condition

f , we ﬁnd

k ˜ϕN (n, t) − ϕ(n, t)k ≤ (2k ˜ϕN (n, 0) − ϕ(n, 0)k + ˜KN )em|t|.

To verify our claim, it suﬃces to show sup|n|≤K k ˜ϕN (n, 0) − ϕ(n, 0)k → 0 as N → ∞. We analyze
j (n, 0) − ϕj(n, 0)| = 0. Otherwise, if

by entry. There are two cases. First, if j > N , we have that | ˜ϕN
j ≤ N ,

| ˜ϕN

j (n, 0) − ϕj(n, 0)| = |((AN )−1(AN (f ) + nαN ))j − A−1(A(f ) + nα)j |

+ |A−1(AN (f ) + nαN ))j − A−1(A(f ) + nα)j |.

By Lemma 6.3 and the uniform convergence of AN and αN to A and α respectively [27], it follows
that these terms go to zero uniformly in N for each |n| ≤ K.

Taking KN = 2 max( ˜KN , 2 sup|n|≤K k ˜ϕN (n, 0) − ϕ(n, 0)k), the claim is proved.

ALMOST PERIODICITY IN TIME OF SOLUTIONS OF THE TODA LATTICE

In the ﬁnite-gap setting, it is known that Jacobi inversion linearizes both translation and Toda

ﬂows [12, Theorem 1.41]. Therefore,

AN (ϕN (n, t)) = AN (ϕN (0, 0)) + nαN + ζ N t

(6.9)

for some αN , ζ N ∈ RN .

Deﬁne the map

M := B−1 ◦ A−1 : π∗(C \ E) → J (E).

If E satisﬁes (1.7), then the map M is a homeomorphism by the considerations of Sodin and Yuditskii
[28]. We will use this map and proceed as in [1] to prove our main theorem.

Proof of Theorem 1.1. Since J0 is almost periodic and σ(J0) = σac(J0) = E, a result of Remling
[22, Theorem 1.4] implies that J0 ∈ J (E). By [29, Theorem 12.6], there is a unique solution J(t)
to (1.1), (1.2), (1.3), and by [23, Proposition 1.4], J(t) ∈ J (E) for each t ∈ R. Consequently, the
solution J(t) is uniformly bounded in time. By Section 3 and Sodin-Yuditskii [28, Theorem C], the
Dirichlet data ϕ(n, t) := B(SnJ(t)) obey

ϕ(n + 1, t) = A−1(A(ϕ(n, t)) + α), ∂tϕ(n, t) = Ψ(ϕ(n, t)).

(6.10)

We now recall the functions ˜ϕN (n, t) introduced above. Since ˜ϕN → ϕ uniformly on compacts
and AN → A uniformly, we can conclude that AN ( ˜ϕN (n, t)) converges uniformly on compacts to
j (ϕN (n, t)) for j ≤ N . Taking the jth
A(ϕ(n, t)). Note that, by deﬁnition, AN
component of (6.9), it follows from uniform convergence that the limits

j ( ˜ϕN (n, t)) = AN

αj = lim
N→∞
ζj = lim
N→∞

αN

exist, and

Aj(ϕ(n, t)) = Aj(ϕ(0, 0)) + nαj + ζjt.

(6.11)

In particular, M−1((a, b)(t)) = M−1(J0) + ζt. This proves the time almost periodicity of solutions.
Finally, the spatial almost periodicity of solutions and the equivalence of frequency modules follow
(cid:3)

from the considerations of Sodin-Yuditskii [28].

Appendix A. Homogeneity as a Consequence of Craig’s Condition

Denote by gC\E(z) the potential-theoretic Green’s function for the domain C\E with a logarithmic

We will focus on sets E which are Regular and Parreau-Widom. We write E ∈ [RP W ] in this case.
We restrict the class of admissible sets even further. Consider the uniformization z : D → ˆC \ E,
and let θ : D → C denote the Blaschke product with zeros at {z−1(cj)}j∈I . The fundamental group
π1( ˆC \ E) is isomorphic to a Fuchsian group ΓE acting on D. Acting by this group preserves the
modulus of θ: |θ(γ · ζ)| = |θ(ζ)|. Thus, there is a function ν : ΓE → T (the “character of θ”) such
that θ(γ · ζ) = e2πiν(γ)θ(ζ). Denote by H 1(ν) the set of all integrable holomorphic functions on the

Sodin and Yuditskii show that a more explicit criterion on E implies E ∈ [RP W ] ∩ [DCT ]:

Theorem A.1 (Theorem H, [28]). Suppose E is homogeneous in the sense of Carleson, i.e., there
exist constants τ > 0 and δ > 0 such that, for all x ∈ E and 0 < r < δ,

Then E ∈ [RP W ] ∩ [DCT ].

|E ∩ (x − r, x + r)| ≥ τ r.

The following lemma is due to Sodin [20, 26]. For the sake of completeness, we present Sodin’s

proof here.

Lemma A.2. Let K = [E, E] \Sj∈I (E−

j ) ⊂ R be a set satisfying condition (1.7). Then K is
a homogeneous set. Moreover, the homogeneity constant τ depends only on E, E, and the value of
the supremum in (1.7).

j , E+

Proof. First observe that for any ﬁxed τ > 0, an intersection of a decreasing sequence of τ -
homogenous sets with uniform δ is always τ -homogeneous, so it is enough to prove the assertion of
the lemma for a ﬁnite collection I. Let us denote

(A.1)

Note the supremum in (A.1) is ﬁnite by condition (1.7), since Cj ≥ E − E. By re-scaling, we can
also assume that E = 0, E = 1. Note that it implies that for all j ∈ I, γj ≤ 1.

We will use a condition which follows from (A.1): if γk ≥ δγj then

Thus, if we deﬁne Kj = K ∩ I ′

j \ Lj, then (A.3) implies condition (A.4).

If Pj χKj (t) > 100C2 then for the j corresponding to the longest interval among I ′

j containing

establishes (A.5).

In the case t− + t+ ≥ t/4, (A.8) follows with ρ = 1/4.
Consider now the case t− + t+ < t/4. In this case, consider the intervals Ij+ and Ij− such that

Appendix B. Vanishing Lyapunov Exponents in the Sodin-Yuditskii Regime

In the context of homogeneity, it is a sort of folklore that we have an equivalence of the equilibrium
and density of states measures (denoted dρE and dk, respectively), and, in particular, everywhere
zero Lyapunov exponents for reﬂectionless Jacobi operators. We oﬀer a formal write-up of this
fact, perhaps initially observed in Eremenko-Yuditskii [9], here. Throughout, we assume our ﬁxed
compact set E is homogeneous.

The equivalence of equilibrium and density of states measures arises in light of a theorem of

Simon:

Theorem B.1 (Theorem 1.15, [25]). For an ergodic family of Jacobi operators J(ω), let E =
1
supp(dk) and C(E) be the logarithmic capacity of E. If limn→∞(a1a2...an)
n = C(E), then dk(x) =
dρE(x).

Here, we have denoted by C(E) the potential-theoretic capacity of E. To apply this theorem in our
situation, we once more appeal to the work of Sodin and Yuditskii.

The Hardy spaces of character automorphic functions on the disk H 2(ω), ω ∈ π∗(C \ E), deﬁned
in the previous section are Hilbert spaces with reproducing kernels kω : D → C. In [28, Theorem F],
these kernels are used to describe continuous trace formulas:

(gC\E(µ+

j )gC\E(cj))

j , σ+

Here, (µ+
j ) correspond to ϕ+ := A−1(A(ϕ)+αE), where αE ∈ π∗(C\E) is completely determined
by E. It is shown that, when E is homogeneous, a Jacobi operator can be recovered exactly from
its Dirichlet data via these trace formulas:

Theorem B.2 (Theorem F, [28]). Let E be homogeneous, let J = (a, b) ∈ J (E), and let B(J) = ϕ.
Then

an = P(A−1(A(ϕ) + nαE))
bn = Q(A−1(A(ϕ) + nαE)).

In particular, the shift action on J (E) conjugates to translation by a constant vector, which,
by deﬁnition, preserves the Haar measure on J (E). By continuity of the above maps, it follows
that every element of J (E) is almost periodic, and, in fact, ergodic. With this theorem and the
aforementioned theorem of Simon, we ﬁnd the following

Proposition B.3. For any J ∈ J (E), we have dk(x) = dρE(x).

ALMOST PERIODICITY IN TIME OF SOLUTIONS OF THE TODA LATTICE

22

We again present a lemma encompassing the majority of the technical details of the proof.

Lemma B.4. For all ω ∈ π∗(C \ E), the reproducing kernels kω satisfy

0 < |θ(0)| ≤ kω(0) ≤ 1

(B.1)

Proof. Because ∞ is not a critical point of Green’s function, θ(0) 6= 0. Furthermore, note that, by
the Direct Cauchy Theorem, we have

where the norms in (B.2) are taken in L2(∂D).

|θ(0)|
kω(0)

= |hθ, kωi| ≤ kθkkkωk = 1

(B.2)

(cid:3)

Applying the Sodin-Yuditskii characterization of the oﬀ-diagonal elements an above, the proof of

the above corollary is now a simple calculation:

Proof of Proposition B.3. Note now that

(cid:3)

kω+α

A somewhat remarkable (although not necessarily surprising) consequence of this is that the

Lyapunov exponent vanishes throughout the spectrum:

Theorem B.5. Suppose E is homogeneous, and let J ∈ J (E). Then the shift cocycle S(1; J, z) has
Lyapunov exponent L(x) zero for all x ∈ E.

Proof. Since E is homogeneous, it is [RP W ], and Green’s function G(z) vanishes throughout the
spectrum and is everywhere continuous. Thus, for all x ∈ E,

By equality of the DOS and equilibrium measures, (B.4), and the Thouless formula, for all x ∈ E,

log |t − x|dρE(t) − log(C(E)) = 0

(B.4)

G(x) =ZE
L(x) =ZE

log |t − x|dk(t) − log(C(E)) = 0.
