Abstract. We study the Stoke’s eﬃciency and it’s ﬂuctuating properties in the
case of a spatial asymmetric ratchet potential with a temporal asymmetric driving
force from adiabatic to nonadiabatic regime. Our numerical investigations show that
the average Stoke’s eﬃciency and the average current decrease with the frequency
of driving. For low frequency of driving, i.e., in the case of an adiabatic regime,
we reproduced the analytical results supporting our numerical simulations. By
evaluating the probability distribution, p(ηs) for Stoke’s eﬃciency, ηs we focus on the
stochastic properties of Stokes eﬃciency. We ﬁnd that in most of the parameter space,
ﬂuctuations in ηs are comparable to or larger than the mean values. In such a situation
one has to study the full probability distribution of ηs. With increase in frequency of
driving, the distribution becomes multipeaked. At the same time the average Stoke’s
eﬃciency decreases with increase in frequency of drive. For high frequency of driving,
the distribution develops a peak across zero. Further increase in frequency this peak
gets sharper. And ﬁnally at suﬃciently high frequency we get a strong peak across
zero indicating that there is no eﬀective transport in this regime.

1. Introduction

Over the last several decades the study of interplay of noise and nonlinearity has become
a major subject of research in various multidisciplinary areas[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. These
studies include the noise induced directed transport, stochastic resonance, noise induced
stability of unstable states, noise induced phase transition, noise induced ordering etc.
In most of the above mentioned cases the presence of noise is very much essential. In
the literature, the noise induced directed transport in periodic extended structures in
the absence of overall net bias has been extensively studied. Two basic ingredients
are required for the posilibity of such directed transport, namely, the system should
be driven out of equilibrium and there should be some asymmetry (either temporal or
spatial) along with nonlinearity in the system. The systems consisting of Brownian
particles and operating with the minimal conditions for such directed transport are
known as Brownian ratchets/Brownian motors [7, 8]. There is increasing interest from
physicists, biologists and engineers on the study of so called ratchets or Brownian motors
[9, 10, 11, 12]. Based on the various ways of introducing the asymmetry or nonlinearity
in the systems, there are various kinds of Brownian ratchet models like ﬂashing ratchets,
rocking ratchets, time-asymmetric ratchets and inhomogeneous ratchets[3].

The main motivation in the study of performance characteristics of Brownian
ratchet is the notion of eﬃciency of energy transduction from the thermal ﬂuctuations
[13]. With the help of stochastic energetic formalism [14, 15, 16] proposed by Sekimoto,
eﬃciency can be deﬁned in a wide class of ratchet models [17, 18]. Diﬀerent kinds
of eﬃciency (thermodynamic, Stoke’s and generalized) for ratchet models have been
studied in detail both analytically and numerically.
Since the Brownian ratchet
operates out of equilibrium, there is always an unavoidable heat transfer to the
medium/environment, which makes it to be less eﬃcient.
It has been noticed that
Brownian motors based on the principle of ﬂashing ratchet models result in low eﬃciency.
On the other hand, Brownian motors based on the adiabatically changing potentials,
e.g., rocked ratchet models exhibit high value in eﬃciency [19, 20, 21, 22, 23]. In this
work, we are mainly interested in the case of spatial asymmetric rocked ratchet models.
In all kinds of ratchet models, it is to be emphasized that the Brownian particle
moves in a periodic potential system and hence it ends up with the same potential energy
even after crossing over to the adjacent potential minimum. Hence there is no extra
energy stored in the particle which can be used for a given purpose. In order to extract
work/energy out of it’s motion, it is necessary to apply an external load force against
which the particle moves and stores energy in the form of potential energy [14, 19, 24].
In this context the eﬃciency of the ratchet can be deﬁned as the output work against
the load force per input energy given to the system. This deﬁnition of eﬃciency is called
as thermodynamic eﬃciency and it’s value is zero when there is no applied load in the
ratchet [14]. The ratchets are not designed to lift the load all the time. Alternatively,
there are various ways of deﬁning the eﬃciency in the ratchet based on the purpose of
the work given to the ratchet. In this work, we are mainly interested in the notion of

Stoke’s eﬃciency and it’s stochastic properties

3

Stoke’s eﬃciency, which is deﬁned as the ratio of the rate of work done against the mean
viscous drag and the rate of input energy given to the ratchet [25, 26, 27].

The Brownian ratchets operate at microscopic length scale. For the systems
operating at this length scale, the energy exchanged (i.e., in the form of mechanical
energy, chemical energy etc.)
between the system and it’s environment is of the
order of thermal energy (few kBT , kB being the Boltzmann constant and T being
the temperature). Thermal ﬂuctuations play a predominant role, thereby exhibiting
distinctly diﬀerent behavior from that of macro systems [28]. In the present work, we
are mainly interested in the study of ﬂuctuating properties of Stoke’s eﬃciency in case of
a spatial and temporal asymmetric rocked ratchet model. Recently the enhancement of
Stoke’s eﬃciency by noise was studied in a microscale domain [29]. In this study, we are
mainly interested on the stochastic properties of Stoke’s eﬃciency and it’s probability
distribution from adiabtic to nonadiabatic limit. We show that in most of the parameter
space, ﬂuctuations dominate the mean values. As we increase the frequency of the drive
the mean Stoke’s eﬃciency and the average current decreases.

2. The Model

We consider the dynamics of an overdamped Brownian particle in a periodic spatial
asymmetric ratchet potential V (x) in the presence of an external time asymmetric
driving force F (t). The motion is governed by the overdamped Langevin equation
[18]

γ ˙x = −V ′(x) + F (t) + ξ(t),

(1)

where x(t) denotes the instantaneous position of the particle and γ being the friction
ξ(t) is the randomly ﬂuctuating Gaussian thermal noise satisfying the
coeﬃcient.

< ... > denote the ensemble average over all the realizations of noise. A schematic
diagram of the ratchet potential V (x) along with the external drive, F (t) is shown in
Fig.1.

where Q is the height of the ratchet potential. λ = λ1 + λ2, is the spatial periodicity of
the ratchet potential, which is set to unity. ∆ = λ1 − λ2 represents the spatial asym-
metric parameter which characterizes the asymmetry of the ratchet potential.

The temporal asymmetric driving force F (t) is given by

F (t) =

τ (1 − ǫ) < t ≤ (n + 1)τ ).

(3)

Here ǫ represents the temporal asymmetric parameter in the driving force and ranges
from 0 to 1. τ (= 2π
ω ) denotes time period of the external driving force with ω being the
frequency of the drive. n = 0, 1, 2.... is an integer.

This model has been studied extensively in the adiabatic limit in [23].

In this
reference, the nature of the averaged current and average eﬃciency is studied in detail.
In the adiabatic limit and at temperature, T → 0 limit, the analytical expression for
the time averaged current, < j > is obtained in [22].

< j >= j1 + j2,

(4)

where j1 and j2 are the fraction of currents in the positive and negative direction over
a time period of τ (1 − ǫ)/2 and τ (1 + ǫ)/2 respectively. j1 is the current when the
external driving force, F (t) = ( 1+ǫ
1−ǫ )F and j2 is the current when the external driving
force, F (t) = −F .

In our present work, we study the unidirectional current as well as the Stoke’s
eﬃciency in the adiabatic as well as nonadiabatic regimes. We show that in general the
current decreases as we shift from adiabatic to nonadiabatic regime. For the ﬁrst time we
have also studied the nature of the stochastic Stoke’s eﬃciency, ηs and it’s ﬂuctuations.
We show that in general average Stoke’s eﬃciency, < ηs > is not a good physical variable
because ﬂuctuations dominate the mean values. Large spatial asymmetry in the ratchet
potential decrease the ﬂuctuations in ηs. To this end we have calculated the probability
distribution, P (ηs) of stochastic Stoke’s eﬃciency, ηs. Recently stochastic eﬀeciency in
heat engines has been studied in great detail in ref. [30]. The Stoke’s eﬃciency is related
to the rate of work done against the average frictional force to the rate of input energy.
Formally stochastic Stoke’s eﬃciency, ηs at any instant of time can be deﬁned as

nature of average Stoke’s eﬃciency, < ηs > as well as on it’s distribution P (ηs).

This is a stochastic quantity and for a given period of the drive. It depends on a

3. Numerical Simulation

(7)

We have simulated the overdamped Langevin dynamics using the algorithim of Huens
method [31]. From the solution of Langevin equation, we evaluate the averaged current,
input energy and Stoke’s eﬃciency. The averaged current is given by

< j >=<

xt − x0
t − t0

>,

(8)

where xt represents the instantaneous position of the particle at time t and x0 being the
position of the particles at time t0. We have run the simulation for 105τ , τ being one
period of the drive. The steady state averages were taken just after ignoring the initial
transients upto 104τ . Each time step is taken to be 0.001.

4. Result and Discussion

This particular ratchet model has been studied theoretically in Ref. [23] in the adiabatic
limit. The nature of average Stoke’s eﬃciency, < ηs > in the adiabatic regime has
been studied in detail. In the present work, we are mainly interested on the stochastic
properties of Stoke’s eﬃciency, ηs and hence on its probability distribution, P (ηs) in
the adiabatic limit as well as for diﬀerent frequency of driving, ω. In this particular
ratchet model, when the noise strength is very low, i.e., in the deterministic limit there
exists potential barriers for the motion of the Brownian particle in both forward as well
as backward directions. The potential barrier in the forward direction disappears only
when the driving force in the forward direction is larger than the force exerted by the
barrier towards the right of the potential, i.e., when ( 1+ǫ
1−ǫ )F > Q
. Similarly the barrier
in the backward direction disappears only when F > Q
. Hence there are critical forces,
λ2
Fc1 = Q
beyond which the barrier disappears in both forward as
λ1
well as backward direction. It implies that a ﬁnite current exists in the ratchet only
when the amplitude of driving, F is in between Fc1 and Fc2. When barrier disappears
in the backward direction, there is a ﬁnite current in the backward direction resulting

1+ǫ ) and Fc2 = Q

a negative contribution in the net current, < j > in the ratchet. In the deterministic
limit, the averaged current, < j > shows a peaking behavior as a function of amplitude
of driving force, F . The current increases from F = Fc1 and shows a maximum at
around F = Fc2 and then decreases with F .

We have simulated the averaged current, < j > and the average Stoke’s eﬃciency,
< ηs > as a function of F and plotted in Fig.2 and Fig.3 respectively for diﬀerent values
of temporal asymmetry parameter, ǫ for a symmetric potential and for temperature
T = 0.01 (close to the deterministic limit). The inset of both the ﬁgures shows the
same plot with larger temperature T = 0.1. These results are for ω = 0.5 corresponding
to the adiabatic limit. In this limit the forcing F (t) is assumed to change very slowly.
It’s frequency is smaller than any other frequency related to the relaxation rate in
the problem, i.e., the system remains in the steady state at each instant of time. From
Fig.2 and Fig.3, we notice that our simulation is in perfect agreement with the analytical
obtained in [23]. The Stoke’s eﬃciency follows the nature of average current as expected.
In our work we have scaled all the lengths with respect to λ1 + λ2 and energies with
respect to the height of the ratchet potential, Q. All physical quantities are in the
dimensionless form. We have set γ = 1. From the simulation results obtained in Fig.2,
we have calculated the values of Fc1 for three diﬀerent values of ǫ, i.e., Fc1 = 1.63
for ǫ = 0.1, Fc1 = 0.857 for ǫ = 0.4 and Fc1 = 0.105 for ǫ = 0.9 respectively in the
deterministic limit (T = 0.01). Fc2 = 2 remains same for all ǫ values since Fc2 = Q
is
λ2
independent of ǫ. These values are in exact agreement with analytically obtained values
in [23].

(ﬂuctuations) of stochastic Stoke’s eﬃciency, Rηs = σs
as a function
of F . Rηs shows a decreasing behaviour with F and shows a minimum. However, the
minimum is larger than 1, indicating that the ﬂuctuations, σs in the Stoke’s eﬃciency
always dominate their mean values, < ηs >. Hence the average Stoke’s eﬃciency is
not a good physical variable in this parameter regime. The distribution of stochastic
Stoke’s eﬃciency is studied in Fig.4(d) for various values of amplitude of driving, F . For
lower F values (F < Fc1), the distribution shows a single peak. This is because of the
presence of potential barrier in both forward as well as backward directions. As a result
the particle makes random movement across any one minimum of the ratchet potential.
With further increase in F (> Fc1) values, the barriers in the forward direction disappears
and the probability of moving the particle towards right increases. The distribution
exhibits multipeaked structure and the mean value shifts towards right indicating that
the average Stoke’s eﬃciency, < ηs > increases with F . The multipeaked structure in
the distribution is related to the distribution of local average velocities (which we have
checked separately in Fig.5) and is due to the presence of barriers. The distribution for
negative values of ηs has a ﬁnite weight. This results from atypical realizations of input
energy (Fig.6) which show negative tails [32, 33, 34]. For larger F , the distribution
becomes narrow and the variance decreases. At the same time the mean value shifts
towards left. In this regime, the barriers in both forward as well as backward directions
disappear and the particle follows straight paths in both the directions.

Next in Fig.7, we have studied the average current, < j >, average Stoke’s eﬃciency,

temperature for a symmetric potential in (a), (b), (c) and (d) respectively. We have
ﬁxed the other parameters as F = 1 and ω = 0.5. In this parameter regime, in order
to have ﬁnite current in the ratchet, the minimum value of ǫ should be greater than
Q−λ1F
Q+λ1F = 0.33. Hence we have kept ﬁxed the value of ǫ as 0.4. Here also we observe that
the average current, < j > and average Stoke’s eﬃciency < ηs > show peaking behaviour
with temperature, T . The Stoke’s eﬃciency < ηs > follows the same behaviour of
average current < j >. However, from Fig.7(a) and 7(b), we notice that there exists
a ﬁnite current and ﬁnite Stoke’s eﬃciency even at zero temperature. This is because
of the absence of potential barrier in the forward direction even at zero temperature.
In this ﬁxed parameter regime, the crictical value of F , Fc1 = Q(1−ǫ)
λ1(1+ǫ) = 0.857 and
hence F > Fc1. Therefore the barrier disappears in the forward direction, as a result
we get a ﬁnite current and ﬁnite Stoke’s eﬃciency even at T → 0 limit. The relative
ﬂuctuations in Stoke’s eﬃciency Rηs with temperature is studied in Fig.7(c). Rηs shows
a minimum in the limit T − > 0 limit and then increases with increase in temperature,
T .
It is always larger than 1 for all values of T . This indicates that ﬂuctuation in
Stoke’s eﬃciency, σs = q< η2
s > − < ηs >2 always dominate the mean value, < ηs >
conﬁrming that ηs is not a self averaging quantity in this parameter regime. The nature
of the distribution function, P (ηs) for various temperature values is studied in Fig.7(d).
For lower temperature values, i.e., close to the deterministic limit, the distribution shows
a single peaked structure with few minor peaks. With further increase in temperature,
the probability of moving the particle to the nearest neighbouring potential minima
in the forward direction increases, resulting a ﬁnite positive contribution towards the
net current, < j > and towards the average Stoke’s eﬃciency, < ηs >. For larger
temperature, the barriers disappear in both the directions. As a result the particle
spreads over in both the direction. This results decrease in the net current, < j > and
average Stoke’s eﬃciency, < ηs >. At the same time the distribution becomes narrow
and shifts towards left.

The average current, < j >, average Stoke’s eﬃciency, < ηs >, the relative
ﬂuctuations in ηs, Rηs and the distribution function P (ηs) with spatial asymmetry, ∆ is
studied in Fig.8(a), (b), (c) and (d) respectively. The average current, < j > (Fig.8(a))
and average Stoke’s eﬃciency, < ηs > (Fig.8(b)) increase with increase in spatial
asymmetry, ∆. This is due to the fact that with increase in asymmetry of the ratchet
potential, the barriers in the forward direction starts decreasing and the probability
of moving the particle towards the next nearest neighbouring potential minima in the
forward direction increases. This results in a ﬁnite positive contribution to the net
current in the ratchet and hence to the average Stoke’s eﬃciency, < ηs >. Therefore, in
this given parameter regime, for a spatial asymmetry ratchet potential, the magnitude
of average current is quite larger than that in case of a symmetric ratchet potential and
hence the spatial asymmetry in the ratchet helps in enhancing the Stoke’s eﬃciency.
However, the relative ﬂuctuations, Rηs (Fig. 8(c)) shows a decreasing behaviour with
increase in spatial asymmetry, ∆, and become less than 1 for larger spatial asymmetry
in the potential. This result reﬂects that for a larger spatial asymmetry in the ratchet

potential, the ﬂuctuations in Stoke’s eﬃciency do not dominate the mean values. As
a result < ηs > behaves as a good physical variable in this parameter regime and a
self-averaging physical quantity. The probability distribution, P (ηs) is studied in Fig.
8(d) for various ∆ values. For a symmetric ratchet potential, i.e., for ∆ = 0.0, the
distribution shows a single peaked structure with few minor peaks in it. The inclusion
of spatial asymmetry in the potential decreases the barrier height towards the right of
the potential. As a result the local velocities in the forward direction increases and the
minor peaks in the distribution disappears. Therefore, with increase in ∆ values, the
spreading in the distribution decreases at the same time the distribution with mean
value shifts towards right indicating that the < ηs > increases with ∆.

Finally we have studied the average current, < j >, average Stoke’s eﬃciency,
< ηs >, Relative ﬂuctuations, Rηs and the probability distribution, P (ηs) with the
frequency of driving, ω in Fig.9(a), (b), (c) and (d) respectively. The average current,
< j > (Fig.9(a)) and the average Stoke’s eﬃciency, < ηs > (Fig.9(b)) shows a decreasing
behaviour with frequency of drive, ω. This is because with increase in frequency of drive,
the forcing amplitude varies so fast that, the particle is not able to take the advantage
of force in either of the direction and the movement of the particle towards the nearest
neighbouring potential minima is suppressed. This decreases the net current as well as
the average Stoke’s eﬃciency. For very high frequency of driving, the forcing amplitude
varies so fast that the particle doesn’t feel the inﬂuence of forcing. The particle as if

stays at one position only and hence the net current, < j > and the average Stoke’s
eﬃciency approaches to zero. However, the relative ﬂuctuations, Rηs (Fig.9(c)) increases
with increase in the frequency of driving, ω and is always larger than 1. The probability
distribution function, P (ηs) with frequency of driving, ω is shown in Fig.9(d). For low
frequency of driving, i.e., in the adiabatic limit, the distribution shows a maximum and
with increase in frequency, ω, the distribution spreads over towards left as well as the
mean value shifts towards left. With further increase in ω, a ﬁnite peak developes across
zero with few minor peaks towards the right side of the distribution. At suﬃciently high
value of ω (i.e., in nonidiabatic regime), we get a sharp peak across zero and the minor
peaks in the distribution get suppressed. This clearly conﬁrms that there is no eﬀective
transport in the parameter regime with high frequency of driving.

5. Conclusion

In conclusion, we have studied the Stoke’s eﬃciency and it’s stochastic properties in the
case of a temporal asymmetric rocked ratchet potential using overdamped Langevin
dynamics simulation. Our main results indicate that over larger parameter space,
stochastic Stoke’s eﬃciency behaves as a non-self averaging physical quantity. The mean
current and stochastic eﬃciency monotonically decrease as we go from adiabatic to the
non-adiabatic regime. All the above mentioned quantities have been studied for diﬀerent

values of forcing amplitude, temperature, asymmetry parameter and driving frequency.
We are presently investigating the nature of stochastic thermodynamic eﬃciency in these
ratchet systems.
