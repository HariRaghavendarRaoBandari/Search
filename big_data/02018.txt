Linear Codes over Galois Ring GR(p2, r) Related to Gauss sums ∗

Aixian Zhang, Jin Li, Keqin Feng

Abstract: Linear codes over ﬁnite rings become one of hot topics in coding the-
ory after Hommons et al.([4], 1994) discovered that several remarkable nonlin-
ear binary codes with some linear-like properties are the images of Gray map of
linear codes over Z4. In this paper we consider two series of linear codes C(G)
and eC(G) over Galois ring R = GR(p2, r), where G is a subgroup of R(s)∗ and
R(s) = GR(p2, rs). We present a general formula on Nβ(a) in terms of Gauss sums
on R(s) for each a ∈ R, where Nβ(a) is the number of a-component of the codeword
cβ ∈ C(G)(β ∈ R(s)) (Theorem 3.1). We have determined the complete Hamming
weight distribution of C(G) and the minimum Hamming distance of eC(G) for some
special G (Theorem 3.3 and 3.4). We show a general formula on homogeneous
weight of codewords in C(G) and eC(G) (Theorem 4.5) for the special G given in
Theorem 3.4. Finally we obtained series of nonlinear codes over Fq (q = pr) with
two Hamming distance by using Gray map (Corollary 4.6).

1 Introduction

Linear codes over ﬁnite rings, like R = Z4, have been researched from as early
as 1970’s, but a series of active eﬀorts appears since the paper of Hammons et
al.[4] in 1994 where the authors discovered that several remarkable nonlinear bi-
nary codes with some linear-like properties are the images of Gray map of linear
codes over Z4. The underlying ﬁnite ring of linear codes has been extended from Z4
to Frobenius rings. Several classiﬁcation results on linear or cyclic codes over ﬁ-
nite rings have been given, the proper(homogeneous) weight and related Gray map
have been found, and the error-correcting ability has been determined by comput-
ing for relatively small parameters or estimated by using exponential sums over
Galois rings[14]. But in general, to determine the minimal distance and weight
distribution of linear codes over Galois ring is a diﬃcult problem.

In 1970’s, Baumert and McEliece [1,12] initiated a method to compute the
weight distribution of irreducible cyclic codes over ﬁnite ﬁelds by using Gauss
sums. The method is developed by Langevin, Van Der Vlugt et al.([9, 18]). The
main aim of this paper is to extend this method to Galois ring R = GR(p2, r).
Namely, we compute the weight distribution for a wide class of linear codes over
R = GR(p2, r) by using Gauss sums on Galois rings. Then by using the homoge-
neous weight for linear codes on R and the Gray map given by [3, 7], we obtain a
series of good nonlinear codes over ﬁnite ﬁeld Fq.

The paper is organized as following. In section 2 we introduce basic facts on
Galois ring R = GR(p2, r) including the additive and multiplicative structure of R.
The group bR of additive characters and the group bR∗ of multiplicative characters,

and Gauss sums on R. Section 3 is the main body of our paper where we express
the Hamming weight distribution of a large class of linear codes over R by Gauss
sums. In section 4, we introduce the homogeneous weight for the linear codes over
q
R and Gray map from R = GR(p2, r) into F
q (q = pr) . As Gray map’s image of
linear codes over R, we obtain a series of good nonlinear codes over ﬁnite ﬁeld Fq.
At last we make some conclusion remarks in section 5.

2 Basic Facts on the Galois ring R = GR(p2, r)

In this section, we introduce some basic facts on the Galois ring R = GR(p2, r).
FACT(1)-(4) can be seen in Wan’s book[16] and for FACT(5) and (6), we refer to
Li et al.[10].

FACT(1) Let p be a prime number, Zp2 = Z/p2Z and Zp = Fp be the ﬁnite ﬁeld
with p elements, we have the following ”module p” homomorphism of rings

(modp) : Zp2 −→ Zp = Fp, a(modp2) 7−→ a = a(modp)

This mapping can be naturally extended as a homomorphism of polynomial rings

(modp) : Zp2[x] −→ Fp[x], f (x) =X

i

aixi 7−→ f (x) =X

i

aixi

The Galois ring GR(p2, r) is deﬁned by the quotient ring

R = GR(p2, r) =

Zp2[x]
(h(x))

(2.1)

(2.2)

where h(x) is a basic primitive polynomial of degree r in Zp2[x] which means that
h(x) is a primitive polynomial of degree r in Fp[x]. Then the ′′module p′′ map
(2.1) induces the following homomorphism of rings

(modp) : R =

Zp2[x]
(h(x)) −→ R =

Fp[x]
(h(x))

= Fq (q = pr)

2

The kernel is the unique maximal ideal M = pR, and R∗ = R\M is the(multiplicative)
group of units. Therefore R is a (commutative) local ring. R have three ideal only:
R, M = pR and (0).

FACT(2) Let ξ be a root of h(x) in R. Then the order of ξ is q− 1 and ξ is a root
of h(x), Fp[ξ] = Fq. By deﬁnition (2.2) of R, each element α of R can be expressed
uniquely as

α = c0 + c1ξ +··· + cr−1ξr−1 (ci ∈ Zp2)

and R is a free Zp2− module with rank r. On the other hand, let
T∗ = hξi = {1, ξ, ξ2,··· , ξq−2}, T = T∗ ∪{0}

Then R = T ⊕ pT . Namely, each element α of R can be expressed uniquely by

α = α1 + pα2 (α1, α2 ∈ T )

we have M = pR = pT . Namely, α ∈ M if and only if α1 = 0 and α ∈ R∗ if and only
if α1 ∈ T∗. Particularly,T = Fq, T∗ = F∗q and |R| = q2 = p2r,|M| = q,|R∗| = q(q− 1).
FACT(3) The group R∗ of units has the direct decomposition

R∗ = T∗ × (1 + M)

where T∗ = hξi is a cyclic group with order q − 1, and the multiplicative group
1 + M = 1 + pT is isomorphic to the additive group Fq by

1 + pTg−→(Fq, +), 1 + pc 7−→ c (c ∈ T )

Thus (1 + M) is an elementary p−group. Namely, 1 + M is a direct product of r
copies of cyclic groups with order p.

FACT(4) R/Zp2 is Galois extension of rings and the Galois group is the following
cyclic group of order r

where σp is deﬁned by

Gal(R/Zp2) = hσpi

σp(α) = αp
1

+ pαp

2 (α = α1 + pα2, α1, α2 ∈ T ).

Then we have the trace mapping:

Zp2 : R −→ Zp2, T R
T R

Zp2 (α) =

r−1X

i=0

p(α) =(cid:0)
σi

r−1X

i=0

1 (cid:1) + p(cid:0)
αpi

r−1X

i=0

2 (cid:1)

This is a surjective homomorphism of Zp2− modules.

More general, let Q = qs(= prs), and

R(s) = GR(p2, rs) =

Zp2[x]
(h(s)(x))

= Zp2[ξ(s)].

where h(s)(x) is a basic primitive polynomial in Zp2[x] with degree rs, and ξ(s) is
a root of h(s)(x) in R(s). Then T (s)∗ = hξ(s)i is a cyclic group with order Q − 1,
T (s) = T (s)∗ ∪{0} and

2 ∈ T (s)}

2 : α(s)

+ pα(s)

2 ∈ T (s)}

We have the following isomorphism of groups

(1 + M(s),·)g−→(FQ, +), 1 + pc 7−→ c(modp) (c ∈ T (s))

The extension R(s)/R of rings is Galois extension with Galois group

where

A character of the additive group (R, +) is called an additive character of R.

The group of all additive characters of R is

bR = {λβ : β ∈ R},
where (for each positive integer m, let ζm = e 2π√

−1
m ∈ C)

A character of the unit group (R∗,·) is called a multiplicative character of R.

Since R∗ = T∗ × (1 + M) and 1 + M (cid:27) (Fq, +), we know that the group of multiplica-
tive characters of R is

bR∗ = bT∗ × (1 + M)b(cid:27) bT∗ × (Fq, +)b (T∗ = hξi, M = pT )

= {ωiϕb : 0 ≤ i ≤ q− 2, b ∈ T},

where

ω(1 + M) = 1, ω(ξ) = ζq−1;

ϕb(T∗) = 1, ϕb(1 + px) = ζ

FACT (6) Gauss sums on R

p

f or x ∈ T.

The calculation of Gauss sums on general ﬁnite rings is initiated by Lamprecht
[8] in 1989. The Gauss sums on Galois rings has been computed in [13,7,10]. In
this paper we restate the result in [10].

Let χ and λ be a multiplicative and additive character respectively. The Gauss

sum on R is deﬁned by

G(χ, λ) = GR(χ, λ) = X
x∈R∗

χ(x)λ(x) ∈ Z[ζ(q−1)p2].

The following result shows that the non-trivial values of all Gauss sums G(χ, λ) on
R are essentially reduced into ones of the Gauss sums on ﬁnite ﬁeld Fq. For the
Gauss sums on ﬁnite ﬁelds we refer to Lidl and Niederreiter’s book [11].
Lemma 2.1[10] For χ = ωiϕb ∈ bR∗(0 ≤ i ≤ q− 2, b ∈ T ) and λ = λβ ∈ bR (β ∈ R), we

have

(II) Let χ , 1((i, b) , (0, 0) ∈ Zq−1 × T ) and λ = λβ , 1(β , 0),

(2.5)

where Gq(ωi) = Px∈F∗q

This result has been proved in [10]. Here we reproduce the proof for reader’s

convenience.

(I) The case λ = 1 is easy. Now we assume that χ = 1 and λ = λβ for β ∈ R\{0}.

In this case,

If β ∈ R∗, then β ∈ F∗q so that the right-hand side is 0. If β ∈ M\{0}, then β = 0 and
the right-hand side is −q.

(II) Proof of (II.1) is easy. For (II.2), we denote T r = T R

ωi(x1)ϕb(1 + px2)ζT r(x1(1+px2))

G(χ) = X

If b = 0, there is no x1 ∈ T∗ such that x1 = 0, so that G(χ) = 0. If b ∈ T∗, there is
unique b′ ∈ T∗ such that b′ = −b, so that G(χ) = qωi(b′)ζT r(b′)
. For p ≥ 3, −b ∈ T∗
so that b′ = −b. For p = 2, we have −b = b, so that b′ = b. We completes the proof
of (2.4). For the Gauss sum G(χ, λp), we have

p2

G(χ, λp) = X

ωi(x1)ϕb(1 + px2)ζT r(x1)

This completes the proof of (2.5).

3. Linear Codes C = C(G) over R = GR(p2, r)

In this section we consider a class of linear codes C = C(G) over Galois ring
R = GR(p2, r), where G is a subgroup of R∗. We computer the weight distribution
of C by using Gauss sums on Galois ring given in section 2.

Let Q = qs, q = pr where p is a prime number. For Galois ring R = GR(p2, r)

and R(s) = GR(p2, sr), their unit groups are

R(s)∗ = T (s)∗ × (1 + pT (s)), R∗ = T∗ × (1 + pT )

where

T (s)∗ = hξ(s)i, T (s) = T (s)∗ ∪{0}
T∗ = hξi, T = T∗ ∪{0}, and ξ = ξ(s)

Q−1
q−1

.

Each subgroup G of R(s)∗ has the following structure

G = D× (1 + pV)

where D = hξ(s)e
i is a subgroup of T (s)∗, Q − 1 = e f , and 1 + pV is a subgroup of
1 + pT (s). Since 1 + pT (s) is an elementary p−group with rank rs, 1 + pV is an ele-
mentary p−group with rank d (0 ≤ d ≤ rs) and V is a d−dimensional Fp−subspace
of FQ = T (s). Thus the size of G is

n = |G| = f pd.

Let G = {x1,··· , xn}, we consider the following code C = C(G) over R,

C = {cβ = (T R(s)

R (βx1),··· , T R(s)

R (βxn)) ∈ Rn : β ∈ R(s)}

(3.1)

7

This is a R−linear code. Namely, C is a R−submodule of Rn. For β ∈ R(s)\{0} and
a ∈ R, let Nβ(a) be the number of a-components of the codeword cβ

Nβ(a) = ♯{1 ≤ i ≤ n : T R(s)
Let R = {a1, a2,··· , aq2}. For m1,··· , mq2 ≥ 0, let

R (βxi) = a}

N(m1,··· , mq2) = ♯{β ∈ R(s) : Nβ(ai) = mi (1 ≤ i ≤ q2)}

(3.2)

Then {N(m1,··· , mq2) : m1,··· , mq2 ≥ 0, m1 + ··· + mq2 = n} is called the complete
weight distribution of C(G), and A0, A1,··· , An is called the Hamming weight dis-
tribution of C(G), where

and

Ai = ♯{β ∈ R(s) : wH(cβ) = i}

wH(cβ) = X
a∈R\{0}

Nβ(a) = n− Nβ(0)

is the Hamming weight of the codeword cβ. The number {A0 = 1, A1,··· , An} is
called the weight distribution of C.

Our main result in this section is the following theorem where Nβ(a) can be

expressed in terms of Gauss sums.

Theorem 3.1 Let C be the linear code over R deﬁned by (3.1). For β ∈ R(s)\{0} and
a ∈ R, Nβ(a) is deﬁned by (3.2). Then
(1) For β ∈ M(s)\{0}, β = pb, b ∈ T (s)∗ ,

If M1 < 1 and M2 < 1, then Nβ(0) < n for all β ∈ R(s)\{0} which means that cβ(β ∈

Remark 3.2 (1) It is well-known that for any χ ∈bF∗Q, we have |GQ(χ)| = √Q. Then
by Lemma 2.1 we know that for χ ∈ dR(s)∗, |GR(s)(χ)| ≤ Q. Since GR∗ = hξ(s)e′
i ×

(2) For any γ ∈ R∗ and β ∈ R(s), T R(s)

R (γβ) = 0
if and only if T R(s)
R (β) = 0. We know that G ∩ R∗ is a subgroup of G with size
l = |G ∩ R∗|, and G is a disjoint union of n′ cosets a j(G ∩ R∗) (a j ∈ G, 1 ≤ j ≤ n′)
of the subgroup G ∩ R∗(⊆ R∗), where n′ = n/l. Now we construct the following
R−linear code

R (β). Therefore T R(s)

eC = eC(G) = {ecβ = (T R(s)

R (βa1),··· , T R(s)

R (βan′)) ∈ Rn′ : β ∈ R(s)}

(3.9)

We know that the parameters of eC is (n′,|C|, d′)q where n′ = n/l and d′ = d(C)/l.
By Theorem 3.1, the values Nβ(a) and d = dH(C) are expressed in terms of
Gauss sums on Galois rings R(s), R and ﬁnite ﬁelds FQ and Fq. By Theorem 2.1,
the values of Gauss sums on Galois rings can be expressed by ones on ﬁnite ﬁelds.
But in general case it is hard to calculate explicitly such values. Now we consider
several very special subgroup G of R(s)∗ for which we can get the values of Nβ(a)
and dH(C) for C = C(G).

For a Fp− subspace A of FQ , the dual subspace of A is deﬁned by

A⊥ = {a ∈ FQ : T Q

p (ax) = 0 for all x ∈ A}

Particularly, C has length n = |G| = (Q−1)pd, size |C| = Q2 and minimum Hamming

From d ≥ r(s− s′) ≥ r and by an elementary calculation we get

pd(Qq−2 − 1) < pd(Qq−2 − 1) + (q− 1)Qq−1 ≤ (Qq−1 − 1)pd < n = (Q− 1)pd

(3.11)
which means that Nβ(0) < n for all 0 , β ∈ R(s). Namely, cβ (β ∈ R(s)) are distinct
codewords of C. Therefore |C| = |R(s)| = Q2 and the minimum Hamming distance
of C is
dH(C) = n− max{Nβ(0) : 0 , β ∈ R(s)} = pd(Q− 1)− pd(Qq−1 − 1) = pdQq−1(q− 1).

4. Homogeneous weight and Gray map

As a generalization of the Lee weight on Z4 = GR(22, 1) ([4]), the homogeneous
weight on Galois ring R = GR(pl, r) (and on more general ﬁnite chain rings) has
been presented in [3,14,17]. Here we consider the l = 2 case.

Deﬁnition 4.1 The homogenous weight whom : R = GR(p2, r) −→ Z is deﬁned by

whom(a) =

q− 1,
q,
0,



i f a ∈ R∗,

where q = pr. This mapping can be extended to ( for any n ≥ 1 )

whom : Rn −→ Z, whom(v) =

nX

i=1

whom(vi) ( f or v = (v1,··· , vn) ∈ Rn)

If C is a linear code over R with length n, the minimum homogeneous distance

of C is deﬁned by

Deﬁnition 4.2 A mapping ψ : Rn −→ F
isometric. Namely, for v, v′ ∈ Rn,

nq
q is called (generalized) Gray map if ψ is

whom(v− v′) = wH(ψ(v)− ψ(v′)).

Since isometric mapping should be injective, the following result can be derived
from Deﬁnition 4.2 directly.

Lemma 4.3 Let C be a linear code over R = GR(p2, r) with length n, ψ : Rn −→ F
be a Gray map. Then ψ(C) is a (nonlinear) code over Fq with length nq, |ψ(C)| = |C|
and the minimum Hamming distance

nq
q

dH(ψ(C)) = min{wH(v− v′) : v, v′ ∈ ψ(C), v , v′}

is dhom(C).

Gray maps ψ : Rn −→ F

nq
q have been constructed in [3] and [17] by algebraic

and combinatorial ways respectively. Here we use the construction given in [3].

Let Fq = {a1,··· , aq}. Each element β of R can be expressed uniquely by

β = β0 + pβ1 (β0, β1 ∈ T so that β0, β1 ∈ T = Fq)

We deﬁne the mapping ψ : R −→ F

q
q by

ψ(β) =(a1β0 + β1, a2β0 + β1,··· , aqβ0 + β1)

q

=( f (a1), f (a2),··· , f (aq)) ∈ F

q ( f (x) = β0x + β1 ∈ Fq[x])

(4.1)

The image of ψ is

ψ(R) = {( f (a1),··· , f (aq)) : f (x) ∈ Fq[x], deg f (x) ≤ 1}

which is the ﬁrst-order generalized Reed-Muller code over Fq. From the well-
known complete Hamming weight distribution of such RM code we can see that
q
the mapping ψ : (R, whom) −→ (F
q, wH) is isometric ([3], Theorem1.1). Then for
each n ≥ 1,
ψ : (Rn, whom) −→ (F
is a Gray map.

Now we compute the homogeneous weight of codewords in C(G) and eC(G)

deﬁned by (3.1) and (3.9) respectively.

Theorem 4.4 Assume that
(i) q = pr, Q = qs, R = GR(p2, r) = T + pT, R(s) = GR(p2, rs) = T (s) + pT (s).
(ii) G = D× (1 + pV) be a subgroup of R(s) = T (s)∗ × (1 + pT (s)), where T (s)∗ = hξ(s)i,

This completes the proof of (4.3). Moreover, aR∗ = R∗ and a(pT∗) = pT∗ for any
a ∈ R∗. This implies that for each a ∈ G ∩ R∗ and x ∈ G, T R(s)
R (βx) so
that whom(cβ) = whom(caβ). Therefore for each codeword ecβ ∈ eC(G), whom(ecβ) =
whom(cβ)/l. This completes the proof of Theorem 4.4.
Applying Theorem 4.4 to C(G) and eC(G) where G is given in Theorem 3.4, we

R (βax) = T R(s)

get the following result.

Finally, we use the Gray map to obtain series of nonlinear codes over Fq. The

following result can be derived from Lemma 4.3 directly.

Corollary 4.6 Let C = C(G) and eC = eC(G) be the linear codes over R given in
Theorem 4.5, ψ be the Gray map deﬁned by (4.1) and (4.2). Then ψ(C) and ψ(eC)
are codes over Fq with length qn = (Q−1)qpd
|ψ(C)| =
|ψ(eC)| = Q2. The Hamming weight distribution of ψ(C) and ψ(eC) are the same as
shown in Table 2, but instead of whom(cβ) and whom(ecβ) by wH(ψ(cβ)) and wH(ψ(ecβ))
respectively. Particularly, both of ψ(C) and ψ(C′) are two-distance code. Their

5. Conclusion

In this paper we consider a series of linear codes C(G) and eC(G) over Galois
ring R = GR(p2, r) where G = D×(1 + pV) is a subgroup of R(s)∗ = T (s)∗ ×(1 + pT (s))
(R(s) = GR(p2, rs)). We have presented a general formula on Nβ(a) in terms of
Gauss sums on R(s) where Nβ(a) is the number of a-component of the codeword
cβ = (T R(s)
R (βx))x∈G in C(G) for a ∈ R and β ∈ R(s) (Theorem 3.1). We have de-
termined the complete Hamming weight distribution of C(G) and the minimum
Hamming distance of eC(G) if D = T (s)∗ and 1 + pV is some special subgroup of
1 + pT (s) (Theorem 3.3). If e′ = [T (s)∗ : GR] = 1, we have determined the minimum
Hamming distance of C(G) and eC(G) (Theorem 3.4). Then we have introduced the
homogeneous weight whom on Rn and showed a general formula whom(cβ), whom(ecβ)
for codeword cβ ∈ C(G) and ecβ ∈ eC(G) (Theorem 4.4). For the special subgroup G
and eC(G) (Theorem 4.5). Finally we obtained series of nonlinear codes over Fq

in Theorem 3.4, we have determined the homogeneous weight distribution of C(G)

with two Hamming distances by using Gray map (Corollary 4.6).

22

Our consideration is mainly concerned on case e′ = 1 in this paper. If e′ ≥ 2
more computation on Gauss sums on R will be involved. In consequent paper we
will deal with some case of e′ ≥ 2 where the Gauss sums can be determined explic-
itly. Moreover, Theorem 3.1 can be viewed as a generalization of irreducible cyclic
codes over ﬁnite ﬁelds, as we indicated in section 1. Recently, several techniques
have been found to determine the Hamming weight distribution of reducible cyclic
codes over ﬁnite ﬁelds. It will be interesting to know if such techniques can be
used in Galois ring case.
