Abstract: It is shown that

P(ka1U1 + · · · + anUnk > u) 6 c P(akZdk > u)

for all real u, where U1, . . . , Un are independent random vectors uniformly distributed on the unit
sphere in Rd, a1, . . . , an are any real numbers, a := q(a2
n)/d, Zd is a standard normal
random vector in Rd, and c = 2e3/9 = 4.46 . . . . This constant factor is about 89 times as small as
the one in a recent result by Nayar and Tkocz, who proved, by a diﬀerent method, a corresponding
conjecture by Oleszkiewicz. As an immediate application, a corresponding upper bound on the tail
probabilities for the norm of the sum of arbitrary independent spherically invariant random vectors
is given.

Usually, at the heart of any good limit theorem is at least one good inequality. This should become clear
if one recalls the deﬁnition of the limit and the fact that a neighborhood of a point in a speciﬁc topology
is usually deﬁned in terms of inequalities. A limit theorem can be very illuminating. However, it only
describes the behavior of a function near a given point (possibly at inﬁnity), whereas a corresponding
inequality would cover an entire range.

Also, the nature of limit theorems is more qualitative, whereas that of inequalities is more quantitative.
E.g., a central limit theorem would state that a certain distribution is close to normality; such a statement
by itself is qualitative, as it does not specify the degree of closeness under speciﬁc conditions. In contrast,
a corresponding Berry–Esseen-type inequality can provide such quantitative speciﬁcs.

This is why good inequalities are important. A good inequality would be, not only broadly enough
applicable, but also precise enough. Indeed, only such results have a chance to be adequately used in real-
world applications. Such an understanding of the role of good and, in particular, best possible bounds
goes back at least to Chebyshev; cf. the theory of Tchebycheﬀ systems [10, 12] developed to provide
optimal solutions to a broad class of such problems. These ideas were further developed by a large
number of authors, including Bernstein [4], Bennett [2], and Hoeﬀding [8, 9]. In particular, Bennett [2]
exerted a considerable eﬀort on comparing various bounds on tail probabilities in various ranges. Quoting
Bennett [2]:

Much work has been carried out on the asymptotic form of the distribution of such sums [of independent
random variables] when the number of component random variables is large and/or when the component
variables have identical distributions. The majority of this work, while being suitable for the determination of
the asymptotic distribution of sums of random variables, does not provide estimates of the accuracy of such

2

asymptotic distributions when applied to the summation of ﬁnite numbers of components. [...] Yet, for most
practical problems, precisely this distribution function is required.

In this note, we shall present an upper bound on a tail probability that is about 89 times as small as

the corresponding bound recently obtained in [14].

To provide a relevant context, let us begin by introducing the class C 2

conv of all even twice diﬀerentiable
functions h : R → R whose second derivative h′′ is convex. Let ε, ε1, . . . , εn be independent Rademacher
random variables (r.v.’s), and let ξ1, . . . , ξn be any independent symmetric r.v.’s with E ξ2
i = 1 for all i.
Take any natural d. For any vectors x and y in Rd, let, as usual, x·y denote the standard inner product
of x and y, and then let kxk := √x · x.
Theorem 2.3 in [15] states that E h(cid:0)√εAεT(cid:1) 6 E h(cid:0)qξAξT(cid:1) for any h ∈ C 2
conv and any nonnegative
deﬁnite n× n matrix A ∈ Rn×n, where ε := [ε1, . . . , εn] and ξ := [ξ1, . . . , ξn]. This can be restated as the
following generalized moment comparison:

E h(kε1x1 + ··· + εnxnk) 6 E h(kξ1x1 + ··· + ξnxnk)

(1)

conv and any (nonrandom) vectors x1, . . . , xn in Rd; indeed, any nonnegative deﬁnite
for any h ∈ C 2
matrix A ∈ Rn×n is the Gram matrix of some vectors x1, . . . , xn in Rd for some natural d, and then
kα1x1 +···+ αnxnk = √αAαT for any α := [α1, . . . , αn] ∈ R1×n. From the comparison (1) of generalized
moments of the r.v.’s kε1x1 + ··· + εnxnk and kξ1x1 + ··· + ξnxnk, a tail comparison was extracted
( [15, Theorem 2.4]), an equivalent form of which is the inequality

P(kε1x1 + ··· + εnxnk > u) < c P(kZrk > u)

(2)

for all real u, where x1, . . . , xn are any (nonrandom) vectors in Rd whose Gram matrix is an orthoprojector
of rank r, Zr is a standard normal random vector in Rr, and

c = c3 := 2e3/9 = 4.46 . . . .

A special case of (2) is the inequality

for all real u, where a1, . . . , an are any real numbers such that

P(|ε1a1 + ··· + εnan| > u) 6 c P(|Z1| > u)

a2
1 + ··· + a2

n = 1.

The quoted results generalize and reﬁne results of [6, 7]. In turn, they were further developed in [16, 17].
A simple inductive argument, which was direct rather than based on a generalized moment comparison,
was oﬀered in [5], where (4) was proved with c ≈ 12.01. Based in part on that inductive argument in [5],
the constant c in (4) was improved to ≈ 1.01c∗ in [19] and then to c∗ in [3], where c∗ := P(|ε1 + ε2| >
2)/ P(|Z1| > √2) = 3.17 . . . , so that c∗ is the best possible value of c in (4).
In [1], another kind of multidimensional generalized moment comparison was obtained. A continuous
function f : Rd → R is called bisubharmonic if the (Sobolev–Schwartz) distribution ∆2f is a nonnegative
Radon measure on Rd, where ∆ is the Laplace operator on Rd. By [1, Theorem 3], for any continuous
function f : Rd → R one has

f is bisubharmonic if and only if E f (y + U√t) is convex in t ∈ (0,∞) for each y ∈ Rd,

(5)

where U is a random vector uniformly distributed on the unit sphere Sd−1 in Rd.

Let U1, . . . , Un be independent copies of U . Theorem 1 in [1] states that

E f (a1U1 + ··· + anUn) 6 E f (b1U1 + ··· + bnUn),

(6)

where f is a bisubharmonic function and a1, . . . , an, b1, . . . , bn are real numbers such that the n-tuple
(b2

1, . . . , b2
One may note that, whereas in (1) each of the random summands ε1x1, . . . , εnxn, ξ1x1, . . . , ξnxn is dis-

n) in the sense of the Schur majorization (see e.g. [13]).

n) is majorized by (a2

1, . . . , a2

tributed on a straight line through the origin, each of the random summands a1U1, . . . , anUn, b1U1, . . . , bnUn
in (6) is uniformly distributed on a sphere centered at the origin.

Since the distributions of the random vectors a1U1 + ··· + anUn and b1U1 + ··· + bnUn are clearly
spherically invariant, without loss of generality one may assume that the function f in (6) is spherically
invariant as well, that is, f (x) depends on x ∈ Rd only through kxk. If f is indeed a spherically invariant
bisubharmonic function, it then follows from (6) and [1, formulas (1.2), (1.3)] that

Let C 2

conv(H) denote the class of all spherically invariant twice diﬀerentiable functions f from a Hilbert
space H to R whose second derivative f ′′ is convex in the sense that the function H ∋ x 7→ f ′′(x; y, y)
is convex for each y ∈ H, where f ′′(x; y, y) is the value of the second derivative of the function R ∋ t 7→
f (x + ty) at t = 0. The class C 2
conv(R)
coincides with the class C 2

conv(H) was characterized in [18], with some applications. Clearly, C 2

conv deﬁned in the beginning of this note.

K. Oleszkiewicz conjectured [14] that

P(ka1U1 + ··· + anUnk > u) 6 c P(akZdk > u)

(9)

for some universal constant c and all real u, where a1, . . . , an, a, U1, . . . , Un, Zd are as before; clearly, (9)
is a generalization of (4). This conjecture was proved in [14] with c = 397 based, in part, on the idea
from [5].

Using inequality (2.6) in [15], one can improve the lower bound 1/397 in [14, Lemma 1] to 1/e2
and thus improve the constant c in (9) from 397 to e2 = 7.38 . . . . Indeed, let, as usual, Φ denote the

standard normal distribution function. Then, by inequality (2.6) in [15], g(d) := P(kZdk > √d + 2 ) >
1 − Φ(cid:0)(√d + 2 − √d − 1 )√2(cid:1) =: q(d), which latter is clearly increasing in d, with q(4) > 1/e2, whence
g(d) > 1/e2 for d = 4, 5, ..., whereas g(2) = 1/e2 < g(3). So, P(kZdk > √d + 2 ) = g(d) > 1/e2 for
d = 2, 3, .... Similarly, P(kZdk > √d ) > 1/e for d = 2, 3, ... (but a lower bound on P(kZdk > √d ) is not

really needed in the proof of the main result in [14]).

The aim of this note is to point out that, based on the generalized moment comparison (7) and results

in [15, 16], one can further improve the constant c in (9):

Theorem 1. Inequality (9) holds (for all real u) with c as in (3). The strict version of (9), again with
c as in (3), also holds.

Our method is quite diﬀerent from that of [14]. In view of (7), Theorem 1 is an immediate corollary

of the following two lemmas.

I. Pinelis/Spherically invariant extension of the Rademacher–Gaussian comparison

Lemma 1. For any function h ∈ C 2
for x ∈ Rd is a spherically invariant bisubharmonic function.
Lemma 2. Let ξ be any nonnegative r.v. such that

conv, the function f : Rd → R deﬁned by the formula f (x) := h(kxk)

Then

E h(ξ) 6 E h(kZdk)

for all h ∈ C 2

conv.

P(ξ > u) < c3 P(kZdk > u)

(10)

(11)

for all real u, with c3 deﬁned in (3).

Proof of Lemma 1. Let U be as in (5) and then let ε be a Rademacher r.v. independent of U . For all
t ∈ (0,∞) and y ∈ Rd

E f (y + U√t) = E f (y + εU√t) = E h(ky + εU√tk) = E EU gbU ,h(βU + ε√t),

(12)

where EU denotes the conditional expectation given U , gb,h(u) := h(cid:0)√u2 + b(cid:1) for b ∈ [0,∞) and u ∈ R,
βU := y · U , and bU := kyk2 − (y · U )2 > 0, so that the r.v. ε is independent of the pair (bU , βU ), which
latter is a function of U . By [15, Lemma 3.1], gb,h ∈ C 2
conv for each b ∈ [0,∞). Hence, by [20, Lemma 3.1]
or [15, Proposition A.1], EU gbU ,h(βU + ε√t) is convex in t ∈ (0,∞). So, in view of (12), E f (y + U√t)
is convex in t ∈ (0,∞). Now it follows by (5) that the function f is indeed bisubharmonic. That f is
spherically invariant is trivial.

Proof of Lemma 2. Taken almost verbatim, the proof of Theorem 2.4 in [15] (based on Theorem 2.3
in [15]) can also serve as a proof of Lemma 2. Indeed, no properties of the r.v. εΠεT were used in the
proof of [15, Theorem 2.4] except that this nonnegative r.v. satisﬁes the inequality in [15, Theorem 2.3]
with A = Π and ξ = Zn, which can then be written as (10) with ξ = √εΠεT and d equal the rank
of Π. (Note here a typo in [15]: in place of “Theorem 2.3” in line 7- on page 363 there, it should be
“Theorem 2.4”.)

Instead of following the entire proof of [15, Theorem 2.4], one can alternatively reason as follows. Let
ξ be any nonnegative r.v. such that (10) holds. Then [15, Lemma 3.5] holds with ξ2 in place of εΠεT . So,
in view of [15, formula (3.11)] and [16, formula (22) in Theorem 3.11], inequality (11) holds for u > µr,
with r := d and µr deﬁned on page 362 in [15]. The cases r1/2 6 u 6 µr and 0 6 u 6 r1/2 are considered
as was done at the end of the proof of [15, Lemma 3.6], starting at the middle of page 365 in [15]. The
case u < 0 is trivial.

An immediate application of Theorem 1 is

Corollary 1. Let X1, . . . , Xn be any independent spherically invariant random vectors in Rd, which are
also independent of the Gaussian random vector Zd. Then

P(kX1 + ··· + Xnk > u) <

2e3
9

P(cid:0)pkX1k2 + ··· + kXnk2 kZdk > u(cid:1)

(13)

for all real u.

This corollary follows from Theorem 1 by the conditioning on kX1k, . . . ,kXnk, because for each i =
1, . . . , n the conditional distribution of the spherically invariant random vector Xi given kXik = ai is the
distribution of aiUi.
In the case when the independent spherically invariant random vectors X1, . . . , Xn are bounded almost
surely by positive real numbers b1, . . . , bn, respectively, one can obviously replace pkX1k2 + ··· + kXnk2

in the bound in (13) by pb2
of 2e3

1 + ··· + b2
9 = 4.46 . . . , was obtained in [14].
Similarly to the extension (13) of inequality (9), one can extend (7) as follows:

n. The resulting bound, but with the constant factor 397 in place

E f (X1 + ··· + Xn) 6 E f(cid:0)pkX1k2 + ··· + kXnk2 Zd(cid:1)

(14)

for any spherically invariant bisubharmonic function f , where X1, . . . , Xn are as in Corollary 1.

A related result was obtained in [11]: if X1, . . . , Xn are independent identically distributed spherically
invariant random vectors in Rd such that E h(kX1k2) 6 E h(kZdk2) for all nonnegative convex functions
h : R → R, then
(15)

Eka1X1 + ··· + anXnkp 6 E kaZd√dkp

for real p > 3, where a1, . . . , an, a are as in (7)–(8).
