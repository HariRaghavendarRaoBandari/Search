Multidimensional Lévy White Noises in Weighted Besov Spaces

March 7, 2016

Julien Fageot, Alireza Fallah, and Michael Unser

Abstract

In this paper, we study the Besov regularity of d-dimensional Lévy white noises. More
precisely, we describe new sample paths properties of a given white noise in terms of weighted
Besov spaces. In particular, the smoothness and integrability properties of Lévy white noises
are characterized using the Blumenthal-Getoor indices. Our techniques rely on wavelet
methods and generalized moments estimates for Lévy white noises.

Introduction

This paper is dedicated to the study of the regularity of a general d-dimensional Lévy white
noise in terms of Besov spaces and is a continuation of our previous work [13]. A random
process is traditionally deﬁned as a collection (Xt) of random variables indexed by t ∈ R,
with some adequate properties. For instance, Lévy processes are described as stochastically
continuous random processes with independent and stationary increments [1, 35]. However, it
is not possible to deﬁne Lévy white noises in the traditional framework. Typically, in the 1D
setting, it is tempting to introduce Lévy white noises as the derivatives of Lévy processes. The
well-known issue is that Lévy processes are (almost surely) not diﬀerentiable in the classical
sense: The derivative of a non-trivial Lévy process does not have a pointwise interpretation. An
alternative way of introducing random processes is based on the abstract theory of measures on
function spaces, as developed by Bogachev [5] among others. In this context, a random process
is a random variable that takes values in a function space endowed with the adequate measurable
structure. In this spirit, Gelfand [15] and Itô [21] have independently introduced the concept of
generalized random processes, deﬁned as random elements in the Schwartz space of generalized
functions [40]. This approach was more extensively exposed in [16, Chapter 3] and [22]. The
d-dimensional Schwartz space has the advantage of being stable by (weak) diﬀerentiation, and
does not only include not only the d-dimensional Lévy white noises, but also all their derivatives.

Measuring regularity with Besov spaces Since we are considering processes that have no
pointwise interpretation, we should consider function spaces with negative smoothness. When
talking about the regularity of random processes, the Sobolev or the Hölder regularities are
natural concepts that comes into mind. In order to be more general, we will question the Besov
regularity of Lévy white noises. Besov spaces include both Sobolev and Hölder spaces, and
provide a ﬁner measure of the regularity of a function [44, 45]. Evaluating the Besov regularity
of random processes over Rd requires the introduction of weights, since they are generally not
decreasing towards inﬁnity. Thereafter, we therefore consider weighted Besov spaces or local
Besov spaces.

Regularity of Lévy white noises and related processes To the best of our knowledge, the
Besov regularity of d-dimensional Lévy white noises has never been addressed in all generality.
Kusuoka [25] estimated the weighted Sobolev regularity of the Gaussian white noise, while Veraar
[48] obtained complete results on the local Besov regularity of the Gaussian white noise. However,
these works are based on intrinsic Gaussian methods and are not easily extended to the non-
Gaussian case. In [13], we derived new results on the Besov regularity of symmetric-α-stable
(SαS) Lévy white noises on the d-dimensional torus. This paper is an extension of [13] in two
ways: (1) we consider Lévy white noises over Rd and deduce the local results as corollaries, and
(2) we extend the results from SαS white noises to general Lévy white noises.

Other important works on the Besov regularity of 1-dimensional Lévy processes shall be
mentioned. The pioneer works concern the Brownian motion [3, 8, 33]; see also [30] for extensions
to more general Gaussian processes, including the fractional Brownian motion. Stable Lévy
processes are being studied in [8] and [32]. Note that Rosenbaum [32] is using wavelet techniques
similar to ours. The case of general Lévy processes was extensively studied by Schilling, both
in the local [36] and weighted cases [37, 38]. Herren obtained similar local results in [18]. In
particular, Schilling and Herren rely on the Blumenthal-Getoor indices introduced in [4] for their
generalization to non-stable processes. In addition, they extend their results to more general
classes of Markov processes. Those indices also play a crucial role in the present study. For a
comprehensive survey on the Besov regularity of Lévy processes, we refer the reader to [6].

Contributions and outline The paper is organized as follows.

• In Section 2, we deﬁne Lévy white noises in the framework of generalized random processes.
We also introduce weighted Besov spaces, based on the wavelet methods developed in [44].

• We derive estimates of the moments of Lévy white noises in Section 3. Moment estimates
are standard technical results to study the regularity of Lévy processes [10]. Our contribu-
tion is to adapt this question to Lévy white noises by considering general test functions.

• In Section 4, we show that weighted Besov spaces are measurable for the cylindrical σ-ﬁeld
on the space S ′(Rd) of tempered generalized functions. More concretely, it allows us to
address the question of the Besov regularity of any generalized random process.

• Sections 5 and 6 are dedicated to the weighted Besov regularity of d-dimensional Lévy
white noises. Section 5 is restricted to weighted L2-Sobolev spaces, and is therefore an
intermediate step required to apply our wavelet techniques in Section 6. The main result
of this paper is Theorem 3. There, we give suﬃcient conditions for a Lévy white noise
to be almost surely in a given weighted Besov space in terms of the Blumenthal-Getoor
indices of the noise.

• In Section 7, we deduce the local Besov regularity of Lévy white noises from the above.

• Finally, we discuss our results in Section 8 and apply them to some speciﬁc families of Lévy

white noises that are often encountered in practice.

2 Preliminaries

2.1 Generalized Processes and Lévy White Noises

The stochastic processes of this paper are deﬁned in the framework of generalized random pro-
cesses [16, Chapter 3]. It allows one in particular to consider Lévy white noises as well-deﬁned

2

random processes, which is not possible in more traditional approaches since they do not admit
a pointwise interpretation.

The Schwartz space of inﬁnitely smooth functions and rapidly decaying functions on Rd
is denoted by S(Rd).
It is endowed with the topology associated with the following notion
of convergence: A sequence (ϕn) of functions in S(Rd) converges to ϕ ∈ S(Rd) if, for every
multiindex α ∈ Nd and every µ ≥ 0, the functions x 7→ |x|µDα{ϕn}(x) converge to x 7→
|x|µDα{ϕ}(x) in L2(Rd), where |·| is the Euclidian norm on Rd. The space S(Rd) is a nuclear
Fréchet space [42, Section 51]. The topological dual of S(Rd) is the space S ′(Rd) of tempered
generalized functions. A cylindrical set of S ′(Rd) is a subset of the form

nu ∈ S ′(Rd),

(hu, ϕ1i, . . . , hu, ϕni) ∈ Bo,

where n ≥ 1, ϕ1, . . . , ϕn ∈ S(Rd), and B is a Borel subset of Rn. We denote by Bc(S ′(Rd))
the cylindrical σ-ﬁeld of S ′(Rd), deﬁned as the σ-ﬁeld generated by the cylindrical sets. Then,
(S ′(Rd), Bc(S ′(Rd)) is a measurable space. We ﬁx the probability space (Ω, F, P).

Deﬁnition 1. A generalized random process is a measurable function

s : (Ω, F) → (S ′(Rd), Bc(S ′(Rd)).

Its probability law is the measure on S ′(Rd), image of P by s. For every B ∈ Bc(S ′(Rd)),

The characteristic functional of s is deﬁned for every ϕ ∈ S(Rd) by

Ps(B) = P({ω ∈ Ω, s(ω) ∈ B}).

Ps1 = Ps2 ⇔ cPs1 = cPs2,

A generalized random process is a random element of the space of tempered generalized func-
tions. The characteristic functional is the inﬁnite-dimensional generalization of the characteristic
function. It characterizes the law of s in the sense that

(d)
= s2 (where (d) stands for equality in distribution). Since the space S(Rd)
which we denote by s1
is nuclear, the Minlos-Bochner theorem [16, 29] gives a complete characterization of admissible
characteristic functionals.

tional of a generalized random process s if and only if it is continuous and positive-deﬁnite over

Theorem 1 (Minlos-Bochner theorem). A functional cP on S(Rd) is the characteristic func-
S(Rd) and satisﬁes cP(0) = 1.

Lévy processes are random processes index by R with stationary and independent increments.
They are deeply related to inﬁnitely divisible random variables [35]. For the same reasons, there
is a one-to-one correspondence between inﬁnitely divisible laws and Lévy white noises. An
inﬁnitely divisible random variable X can be decomposed as X = X1 + · · · + Xn for every n ≥ 1.
We say that a function f from R to C is a Lévy exponent if it is the continuous log-characteristic
function of an inﬁnitely divisible random variable. We say moreover that f satisﬁes the Schwartz
condition if the moment E[|X|ǫ] of X is ﬁnite for some ǫ > 0.

Let X = (X1, . . . , Xn) be i.i.d.

inﬁnitely divisible random variables with common Lévy

exponent f . By independence, the characteristic function of X is

ΦX (ξ) = exp  nXi=1

f (ξi)!

(6)

for every ξ = (ξ1, . . . , ξn) ∈ Rn. The class of Lévy white noise can be seen as the generalization
of this principle in the continuous domain, up to the replacement of the sum in (6) by an integral.

Deﬁnition 2. A Lévy white noise is a generalized random process w with characteristic func-
tional of the form

cPw(ϕ) = exp(cid:18)ZRd

f (ϕ(x))dx(cid:19)

for every ϕ ∈ S(Rd), where f is a Lévy exponent that satisﬁes the Schwartz condition.

Gelfand and Vilenkin have proved that the functional (7) is a valid characteristic functional on
D(Rd), the space of compactly supported and inﬁnitely smooth functions, without the Schwartz
condition on f [16]. The Schwartz condition is suﬃcient to extend this result to S(Rd) [12,
Theorem 3]. Recently, Dalang and Humeau have shown that this condition is also necessary: A
white noise with Lévy exponent that does not satisfy the Schwartz condition is almost surely
not in S ′(Rd) [9, Theorem 3.13].

A Lévy white noise is stationary, in the sense that w

(d)
= w(· − x0) for every x0 ∈ Rd. It is
moreover independent at every point, meaning that hw, ϕi and hw, ψi are independent whenever
ϕ and ψ ∈ S(Rd) have disjoint supports. In 1-D, we recover the usual notion of white noise,
since w is the derivative in the sense of generalized functions of the Lévy process with the same
Lévy exponent. This principle can be extended in any dimension d ≥ 2: The d-dimensional Lévy
white noise is the weak derivative Dx1 · · · Dxd{s} of the d-dimensional Lévy sheet s [9].

2.2 Weighted Sobolev and Besov Spaces

Our goal is to characterize the smoothness of Lévy white noises in terms of weighted Besov
spaces. All our results related to Besov spaces would require the corresponding intermediate
result for Sobolev spaces which we introduce in Section 2.2.1.

2.2.1 Weighted Sobolev Spaces

We set hxi = p1 + |x|2. The Fourier transform of f ∈ S ′(Rd) is denoted by bf. For τ ∈ R,

we deﬁne Lτ (the Bessel operator of order τ ) as the pseudo-diﬀerential operator with Fourier
multiplier h·iτ . In Fourier domain, we write

(7)

(8)

\Lτ {ϕ}(ω) := hωiτbϕ(ω)

for every ω ∈ Rd and ϕ ∈ S(Rd). When τ > 0, the operator Iτ = L−τ is called a Bessel potential
[17]. The operator Lτ is self-adjoint, linear, and continuous from S(Rd) to S(Rd), since its
Fourier multiplier is inﬁnitely smooth and bounded by a polynomial function. It can therefore
be extended as a linear and continuous operator from S ′(Rd) to S ′(Rd).

Deﬁnition 3. Let τ, µ ∈ R. The Sobolev space of smoothness τ is deﬁned by

W τ

2 (Rd) :=nf ∈ S ′(Rd), Lτ {f } ∈ L2(Rd)o

4

(9)

and the Sobolev space of smoothness τ and weight µ is

W τ

2 (Rd; µ) :=nf ∈ S ′(Rd),

We also set L2(Rd; µ) := W 0

2 (Rd; µ).

h·iµf ∈ W τ

2 (Rd)o .

(10)

We summarize now the basic properties on weighted Sobolev spaces that are useful for our

work.

Proposition 1. The following properties hold for weighted Sobolev spaces.

• For µ, τ ∈ R, W τ

2 (Rd; µ) is a Hilbert space for the scalar product

hf, giW τ

2 (Rd;µ) := hLτ {h·iµf }, Lτ {h·iµg}iL2(Rd) .

We denote by kf kW τ

2 (Rd;µ) = hf, f i1/2
W τ

2 (Rd;µ) the corresponding norm.

• For µ ∈ R ﬁxed and for every τ1 ≤ τ2, we have the continuous embedding

W τ2

2 (Rd; µ) ⊆ W τ1

2 (Rd; µ).

• For τ ∈ R ﬁxed and for every µ1 ≤ µ2, we have the continuous embedding

W τ

2 (Rd; µ2) ⊆ W τ

2 (Rd; µ1).

(11)

(12)

(13)

• For µ, τ ∈ R, the operator Lτ,µ : f 7→ h·iµLτ {f } is an isometry from L2(Rd) to W −τ

(Rd; −µ).

• The dual space of W τ

(Rd; −µ) for every τ, µ ∈ R.

• We have the countable projective limit

• We have the countable inductive limit

(Rd;−µ) = kL−τ {h·i−µLτ,µf }kL2(Rd) = kf kL2(Rd)

proves that Lτ,µ is an isometry. For every f, g ∈ L2(Rd), we have that

hLτ {h·iµf }, L−τ {h·i−µg}iL2(Rd) = hf, giL2(Rd).

(16)

(19)

Since W τ
Finally, we can reformulate the topology on S(Rd) as (14). This implies directly (15).

2 (Rd; µ) = {Lτ {h·iµf }, f ∈ L2(Rd)}, we easily deduce the dual of W τ

2 (Rd; µ) from (19).

2.2.2 Weigthed Besov Spaces

Following Triebel [44], our deﬁnitions of weighted Besov spaces are based on wavelets. More
traditionally, Besov spaces are introduced through the Fourier transform, see for instance [43].
The use of wavelets is equivalent and appears to be more convenient for our framework.

Let us ﬁrst introduce the wavelet bases that we should use. We denote by j ≥ 0 the scaling
index and m ∈ Zd the shifting index. Consider ψF and ψM, which are the father and mother
wavelet of a wavelet basis for L2(R), respectively. We set G0 = {M, F }d and Gj = G0\(F, . . . , F )
for j ≥ 1. For a gender G = (G1, . . . , Gd) ∈ G0 and for every x = (x1, . . . , xd) ∈ Rd, we deﬁne

ψG(x) =

ψGi(xi).

dYi=1

(20)

Proposition 2 (Section 1.2.1, [44]). For every integer u ≥ 0, there exist compactly supported
wavelets ψF and ψM such that

is an orthonormal basis of L2(Rd), where

(cid:8)ψj,G,m,

j ≥ 0, G ∈ Gj, m ∈ Zd(cid:9)

ψj,G,m := 2jd/2ψG(2j · −m)

and ψG is deﬁned according to (20).

(21)

(22)

Concretely, [44] considers separable Daubechies wavelets with the adequate regularity. For

τ, µ ∈ R and 0 < p, q ≤ ∞, the Besov sequence space bτ

p,q(µ) is the collection of sequences

λ = {λj,G,m,

j ≥ 0, G ∈ Gj, m ∈ Zd}

such that

,

with the usual modiﬁcations when p and/or q = ∞.

Deﬁnition 4. Let τ, µ ∈ R and 0 < p, q ≤ ∞. Fix

u > max(τ, d(1/p − 1)+ − τ )

and set (ψj,G,m) a wavelet basis of L2(Rd) with regularity u. The weighted Besov space Bτ
is the collection of generalized function f ∈ S ′(Rd) that can be written as

p,q(Rd; µ)

f = Xj,G,m

2−jd/2λj,G,mψj,G,m

(26)

with λ = (λj,G,m) ∈ bτ

p,q(µ), where the convergence holds unconditionally in S ′(Rd).

6

This deﬁnition is usually introduced as a characterization of Besov spaces. When (26) occurs,

the representation is unique and we have that [44, Theorem 1.26]

λj,G,m = 2jd/2hf, ψj,G,mi.

(27)

To measure a given Besov regularity (ﬁxed p, q, τ , and µ), we should select a wavelet with
p,q(Rd; µ). This is the
enough regularity that the wavelet coeﬃcients are well-deﬁned for f ∈ Bτ
meaning of (25). Under this condition, and for f ∈ Bτ

p,q(Rd; µ), the quantity

kf kBτ

p,q(Rd;µ) :=Xj≥0

1/q

q/p

is ﬁnite, with the usual modiﬁcations when p and/or q = ∞. The quantity (28) is a norm
for p, q ≥ 1, and a quasi-norm otherwise.
In any case, the Besov space is complete for its
(quasi-)norm, and is therefore a (quasi-)Banach space. We have moreover the equivalence [11,
Theorem 4.2.2]

f ∈ Bτ

p,q(Rd; µ) ⇔ h·iµf ∈ Bτ

p,q(Rd)

(29)

p,q(Rd) := Bτ

Weighted Besov spaces are embedded, as we show in Proposition 3.

Proposition 3. We ﬁx τ0, τ1, µ0, µ1 ∈ R and 0 < p0, q0, p1, q1 ≤ ∞. We assume that

τ0 > τ1 and µ0 ≥ µ1.

If, moreover, we have that

Proof. Condition (32) was proved to be suﬃcient in [11, Section 4.2.3]. Note however that we
can easily prove the embedding by using Besov sequence spaces, as we shall do for the other
condition. We could not ﬁnd any precise statement of embeddings between Besov spaces for
p1 ≤ p0 in the literature, so we provide our own proof for the suﬃciency of (33).

First of all, the parameter q is dominated by parameters τ and p in the sense that, for every

τ ≥ 0, ǫ > 0, and 0 < p, q, r ≤ ∞, we have the embedding [45, Proposition 2, Section 2.3.2]

Bτ +ǫ

(35)

Note that Triebel considers unweighted spaces in [45], but the extension to the weighted case
is obvious. This allows to restrict us to the case q0 = q1 = q. Fix λ = {λj,G,m, j ≥ 0, G ∈

Gj, m ∈ Zd}. Due to the Hölder inequality, as soon as 1/a + 1/b = 1, we have, for every j ≥ 0

We choose a = p0/p1 ≥ 1, thus (µ1 − µ0)p1b = (µ1 − µ0)/(1/p1 − 1/p0) < −d by using (33), and

the corresponding embedding between Besov sequence spaces. Finally, (34) is a consequence of
the isomorphism between Besov sequence spaces and Besov function spaces in Deﬁnition 4 (see
[44, Theorem 1.26] for more details on the isomorphism). We let the reader adapt the proof
when p and/or q are inﬁnite.

p1 ,q(µ1) ≤ C ′kλkbτ0

If the only knowledge provided to us is that the generalized function f is in S ′(Rd), then
this is not enough to of which regularity u should be the wavelet to characterize the Besov
smoothness of f . But if we have additional information on f , for instance its inclusion in a
Sobolev space, then the situation is diﬀerent. Proposition gives a wavelet-domain criterion to
determine if a generalized function f , known to be in W τ0
2 (Rd; µ0), is actually in a given Besov
space Bτ

p,q(Rd; µ).

Proposition 4. Let τ, τ0, µ, µ0 ∈ R and 0 < p, q ≤ ∞. We set

u > max(|τ0| , |τ − d(1/p − 1/2)+|).

(38)

Then, the generalized function f ∈ W τ0

with (ψj,G,m) a wavelet basis of L2(Rd) of regularity u, with the usual modiﬁcations when p

Proof. Let τ1 < min(τ0, τ −d(1/p−1/2)+) and µ1 ≤ min(µ0, µ−d(1/p−1/2)+). Then, according
to Proposition 3, we have the embeddings

p,q(Rd; µ) ⊆ W τ1

Condition (38) implies that we can apply Deﬁnition 4 into the space W τ1
2 (Rd; µ1). In particular,
if (ψj,G,m) is the wavelet basis of Deﬁnition 4 with regularity u, and for every function f ∈
W τ1
2 (Rd; µ1), then the wavelet coeﬃcients hf, ψj,G,mi are well-deﬁned. Moreover, we have the
characterization

f ∈ Bτ

p,q(Rd;µ) < ∞

for f ∈ W τ1

2 (Rd; µ1) and, therefore, for f ∈ W τ1

3 Moment Estimates for Lévy White Noises

The goal of this section is to obtain bounds for the pth moments of the random variable hw, ϕi,
where w is a Lévy white noise and ϕ ∈ S(Rd). The bounds are related to the moments of ϕ. For
instance, for a symmetric α-stable white noise wα, it is known [13, Lemma 2] that

E [|hwα, ϕi|p] = Cp,αkϕkp
α,

(40)

where Cp,α is a constant, ﬁnite if and only if α = 2 (Gaussian case), or p < α < 2 (non-Gaussian
case).

3.1 Blumenthal-Getoor Indices

In order to generalize (40) to non-stable white noises, we consider the Blumenthal-Getoor indices
introduced in [4], which are classical tools to estimate the moments of Lévy processes [10, 24, 27].

Deﬁnition 5. Let f be a Lévy exponent. We consider the two intervals

I0 =(p ∈ [0, 2],
I∞ =(p ∈ [0, 2],

lim sup

|ξ|→0

f (ξ)

The indices of Blumenthal-Getoor are deﬁned by

β0 = sup I0,

β∞ = inf I∞.

(41)

(42)

(43)

Proposition 5. Consider a Lévy exponent f with intervals I0 and I∞ as in (41) and (42). Then,
for ˜β0 ∈ I0 and ˜β∞ ∈ I∞, we have the inequality

ZRd

|f (ϕ(x))|dx ≤ C(cid:16)kϕk

(Rd) and some constant C > 0.

for all ϕ ∈ L ˜β0
Proof. The functions ξ 7→ |f (ξ)| and ξ 7→ |ξ| ˜β0 + |ξ| ˜β∞ are two continuous functions, the second
one dominating the ﬁrst one at zero and at inﬁnity. Therefore, there exists a constant C > 0
that satisﬁes

Integrating the latter equation over x ∈ Rd with ξ = ϕ(x), we obtain (44).

|f (ξ)| ≤ C(cid:16)|ξ|

˜β0 + |ξ|

˜β∞(cid:17) .

3.2 Moment Estimates for hw, ϕi

We estimate the moments of a random variable by relaying the fractional moments to the char-
acteristic function. Proposition 6 can be found for instance in [10, 26, 28] with some variations.
For the sake of completeness, we recall the proof, similar to the one of [10].

Proposition 6. For a random variable X with characteristic function ΦX and 0 < p < 2, we
have the relation

E[|X|p] = cpZR

Theorem 2. Consider a Lévy white noise w with Blumenthal-Getoor indices β0 and β∞. Then,
for every ϕ ∈ S(Rd) and 0 < p < β0, we have the inequality

for some constant C > 0, with ˜β0 ∈ I0, ˜β∞ ∈ I∞, and p < ˜β0, ˜β∞. Moreover, the result is still
valid for p = ˜β0 = ˜β∞ = 2 if β0 = 2 ∈ I0 (ﬁnite-variance case).

We use three simple lemmas in the proof of Theorem 2.

Lemma 1. There exists a constant C > 0 such that, for every z ∈ C with ℜ(z) ≤ 0, we have
that

(47)

(48)

(49)

(50)

(51)

(52)

Proof. First, for any z ∈ C, we have that (1 − e−|z|) ≥ 0. Consider the function

|1 − ez| ≤ C(cid:16)1 − e−|z|(cid:17) .

h(z) =

|1 − ez|
1 − e−|z|

,

which is well-deﬁned and continuous over C\{0}. Since h(z)→1 when z → 0, we extend h
continuously to C with h(0) = 1. For z such that ℜ(z) ≤ 0 and |z| ≥ log 2, we have (1 − e−|z|) ≥
1/2 and |1 − ez| ≤ 2, hence 0 ≤ h(z) ≤ 4. Moreover,

K = {z ∈ C,

|z| ≤ log 2, ℜ(z) ≤ 0}

is compact. Therefore, the continuous function h is bounded on K. Finally, we have shown that
h is bounded on {z ∈ C, ℜ(z) ≤ 0}, which gives (51).

Lemma 2. Let x, y ≤ 1. Then, (1 − xy) ≤ (1 − x) + (1 − y).

Proof. From the assumption, we know that 0 ≤ (1 − x)(1 − y) = (1 − x) + (1 − y) − (1 − xy) and
the result follows.

ZR

for every x ∈ R.

ΦX(ξ) = exp(cid:18)ZRd

ending the proof.

The ﬁnite-variance case, when β0 = 2 ∈ I0, cannot be deduced with the same arguments,

since (45) is not valid any more. However, we know in this case that

E[hw, ϕi2] = σ2kϕk2

(58)

where σ2 and µ are the variance and the mean of the inﬁnitely divisible random variable with the
same Lévy exponent as w [47, Proposition 4.15], respectively. Hence, the result is still valid.

We take advantage of Theorem 2 in a slightly less general form and apply it to wavelets, which
are functions that are rescaled versions of an initial function.Corollary 1 is a useful consequence
of Theorem 2. For ϕ ∈ S(Rd), j ≥ 0, and m ∈ Zd, we set ϕj,k = 2jd/2ϕ(2j · −m).

11

Corollary 1. Let w be a Lévy white noise with indices β0 and β∞. We assume either that

β∞ < β0, or that β∞ = β0 ∈ I∞T I0. We ﬁx p < β ∈ I0T I∞. Then, there exists a constant C

such that, for every ϕ ∈ S(Rd), j ≥ 0, and m ∈ Zd,

E [|hw, ϕj,mi|p] ≤ C2jdp(1/2−1/β)kϕkp
β.

(59)

Moreover, this result is still valid if p = β = 2 ∈ I0.

Proof. Remark ﬁrst that the assumptions on β0 and β∞ imply that I0T I∞ 6= ∅. We apply

Theorem 2 with ˜β∞ = ˜β0 = β. In particular, we have that E [|hw, ϕj,mi|p] ≤ Ckϕj,mkp
result follows from the relation

β. The

(60)

the last equality being obtained by the change of variable y = 2j x − m. The result is still valid
for p = β = 2 for which we can still apply Theorem 2.

3.3 Application of Moment Estimates to the Extension of hw, ϕi for Non-

Smooth Functions

A generalized random process s is a random variable from Ω to S ′(Rd). Alternatively, it can be
seen as a linear and continuous map from S(Rd) to the space L0(Ω) of real random variables,
that associates to ϕ ∈ S(Rd) the random variable hs, ϕi1. The space L0(Ω) is a Fréchet space
associated with the following notion of convergence. A sequence (Xn) converges to X in L0(Ω)
if and only if kXn − XkL0(Ω) = E[min(|Xn − X|, 1)] −→
0. The topology on L0(Ω) corresponds
n→∞
to the convergence in probability. We also deﬁne the spaces Lp(Ω) for 0 < p < ∞ associated for
p ≥ 1 (p < 1, respectively) with the norm (the quasi-norm, respectively) kXkLp(Ω) = E[|X|p].
See [22, Section 2.2] for more details.

To measure the Besov regularity of Lévy white noises, we shall consider random variables
hw, ϕi for test functions ϕ not in S(Rd). We handle this by extending the domain of test functions
through which one can observe a generalized random process.

Lemma 4. Let 0 < p, β < ∞. Consider a generalized random process s. We assume that, for
all ϕ ∈ S(Rd),

E[|hs, ϕi|p] ≤ Ckϕkp
β

(61)

for some constant C > 0. Then, we can extend s as a linear and continuous map from Lβ(Rd)
to L0(Ω). Moreover, (61) remains valid for ϕ ∈ Lβ(Rd).

Before proving this result, we remark that it immediately implies Corollary 2.

Corollary 2. Under the conditions of Corollary 1, we can extend hw, ϕi for ϕ ∈ Lβ(Rd). More-
over, (59) remains valid for any ϕ ∈ Lβ(Rd).

1This is not as obvious as it might seem in inﬁnite-dimension, and is again due to the nuclear structure of
S(Rd). For the links between E′-valued random variables and linear functionals from E to L0(Ω) (with E′ the
dual of E), see [22, Section 2.3], in particular Theorems 2.3.1 and 2.3.2.

12

Proof of Lemma 4. Fix ϕ ∈ Lβ(Rd). Let (ϕn) be a sequence of elements in S(Rd) such that
ϕ in Lβ(Rd). Such a sequence exists by density of S(Rd) into Lβ(Rd), well-known for
ϕn −→
n→∞
β ≥ 1, and easily extended for 0 < β < 1. Then, for every n, m ∈ N, it holds that

E[|hs, ϕni − hs, ϕmi|p] = E[|hs, ϕn − ϕmi|p]

≤ Ckϕn − ϕmkp
β,

so that (hs, ϕni) is a Cauchy sequence in the complete space Lp(Ω). It therefore converges to a
random variable X in Lp(Ω). Moreover, this limit does not depend on the sequence (ϕn) chosen
to approximate ϕ. Indeed, if ( ˜ϕn) is another sequence converging to ϕ in Lβ(Rd), and deﬁning
˜X as the limit of hs, ˜ϕni in Lp(Ω), we have that

E[|X − ˜X|p] = E[|X − hs, ϕni + hs, ϕn − ˜ϕni + hs, ˜ϕni − ˜X|p]

(62)

We have moreover, for x, y, z ∈ R, that

|x + y + z|p ≤(3p−1 (|x|p + |y|p + |z|p)

|x|p + |y|p + |z|p

if p ≥ 1,
otherwise.

Hence, if we set Cp = 3p−1 if p ≥ 1 and Cp = 1 if p < 1, we deduce from (62) that

E[|X − ˜X|p] ≤ Cp(cid:16)E[|X − hs, ϕni|p] + E[hs, ϕn − ˜ϕni|p] + E[hs, ˜ϕni − ˜X|p](cid:17) .

The three terms in (63) vanish when n → ∞. For the second one, we use that E[hs, ϕn − ˜ϕni|p] ≤
Ckϕn − ˜ϕnkp

β. This proves that X = ˜X almost surely. We therefore deﬁne X = hs, ϕi.
Finally, (61) is still valid for ϕ ∈ Lβ(Rd) by continuity of s from Lβ(Rd) to Lp(Ω).

4 Measurability of Weighted Besov Spaces

A generalized random process is a measurable function from Ω to S ′(Rd), endowed with the
cylindrical σ-ﬁeld Bc(S ′(Rd)). In the next sections, we investigate in which Besov space (local
or weighted) is a given Lévy white noise. We show here that this question is meaningful in the
sense that any Besov space Bτ

p,q(Rd; µ) is measurable in S ′(Rd).

Proposition 7. For every 0 < p, q ≤ ∞ and τ, µ ∈ R, we have that

Bτ

p,q(Rd; µ) ∈ Bc(S ′(Rd)).

(64)

The proof of this result is very similar to the one of [13, Theorem 4], except we work now

over Rd and deal with weights. In particular, we will rely on [13, Lemma 1].

Proof. We obtain the desired result in three steps. We treat the case p, q < ∞ and let the reader
adapt the proof for p and/or q = ∞.

• First, we show that W τ

2 (Rd; µ) ∈ Bc(S ′(Rd)) for every τ, µ ∈ R. Let (hn)n∈N be an
orthonormal basis of L2(Rd), with hn ∈ S(Rd) for all n ≥ 0. (We can for instance consider
the Hermite functions, based on Hermite polynomials, see [41, Section 2] or [22, Section
1.3] for the deﬁnitions.) The interest of having basis functions in S(Rd) is that we have
the characterization

L2(Rd) =(f ∈ S ′(Rd), Xn∈N

|hf, hni|2 < ∞) .

(65)

13

More generally, with the notations of Section 2.2.1, f ∈ W τ
L2(Rd), from which we deduce that

2 (Rd; µ) if and only if Lτ {h·iµf } ∈

W τ

2 (Rd; µ) =(f ∈ S ′(Rd), Xn∈N

|hf, h·iµLτ {hn}i|2 < ∞) .

(66)

We can therefore apply [13, Lemma 1] with α = 2, S = N, and ϕn = h·iµLτ {hn}, to deduce
that W τ

2 (Rd; µ) ∈ Bc(S ′(Rd)).

• For any τ, µ ∈ R, the cylindrical σ-ﬁeld of W τ

2 (Rd; µ) is the σ-ﬁeld Bc(W τ

2 (Rd; µ))generated

by the sets

nu ∈ W τ

2 (Rd; µ), (hu, ϕ1i, · · · , hu, ϕni) ∈ Bo,

(Rd; −µ), and B is a Borelian subset of RN . Then,

(67)

where N ≥ 1, ϕ1, . . . , ϕN ∈ W −τ
W τ

2 (Rd; −µ) ∈ Bc(S ′(Rd)) implies that

2

Bc(W τ

2 (Rd; µ)) ⊂ Bc(S ′(Rd)).

(68)

• Finally, we show that Bτ

p,q(Rd; µ) ∈ Bc(W τ1

2 (Rd; µ1)) for some τ1, µ1 ∈ R. Coupled with

(68), we deduce (64).
Fix τ1 ≤ τ + d (1/2 − 1/p) and µ1 < µ + d (1/p − 1/2). According to Proposition 3, we
have the embedding Bτ
2 (Rd; µ1). Now, we can rewrite Proposition 4 (with
τ0 = τ1 and µ0 = µ1) as

p,q(Rd; µ) ⊆ W τ1

Bτ

p,q(Rd; µ) =

f ∈ W τ1

2 (Rd; µ1), Xj,G Xm

|hf, 2j(τ −d/p+d/2)h2−j miµψj,G,mi|p!q/p

(69)
Again, we apply [13, Lemma 1] with S = {(j, G), j ∈ Z, G ∈ Gj}, n = (j, G), Tn = T(j,G) =
Zd, ϕn,m = ϕj,G,m = 2j(τ −d/p+d/2)h2−jmiµψj,G,mi, α = p, and β = q/p, to deduce that
Bτ
2 (Rd; µ1)). Remark that, strictly speaking, Lemma 1 in [13] is stated
for Tn ﬁnite, but the proof is easily adapted to Tn countable.

p,q(Rd; µ) ∈ Bc(W τ1

.

< ∞

Proposition 7 suggests that the framework of generalized random processes is particularly
well-suited to addressing regularity issues. By comparison, we recall that the space C(Rd) of
continuous functions is not measurable with respect to the topological σ-ﬁeld on the space of all
functions, while we have that

C(Rd) ∈ Bc(D′(Rd)),

(70)

which is the cylindrical σ-ﬁeld of the space of generalized functions (not necessarily tempered)
[14, Proposition III.3.3]. See [7] for a discussion on the measurability of function spaces and the
advantages of generalized random processes.

5 Lévy White Noises on Weighted Sobolev Spaces

In order to characterize the Besov smoothness of Lévy white noises, we ﬁrst obtain information
on their Sobolev smoothness.

Proposition 8. A Lévy white noise w with indices β0 > 0 and β∞ is in the weighted Sobolev
space W −τ

W n

2 (Rd; n).

We are therefore in the context of [19, Theorem A.2]. It implies in particular that, if

• the characteristic functional cPw of w is continuous over L2(Rd; µ0), and

• the identity operator I is Hilbert-Schmidt from W τ

2 (Rd; µ) to L2(Rd; µ0),

then w ∈ W −τ

|log cPw(ϕ)| ≤ZRd

|f (ϕ)| ≤ C ′kϕk2

L2(Rd;−µ0).

(76)

This implies that cPw is well-deﬁned over L2(Rd; −µ0) and continuous at ϕ = 0. Since cPw is

positive-deﬁnite, it is therefore continuous over L2(Rd; −µ0) [20].

Hilbert-Schmidt condition The operator L−τ,−µ is deﬁned in Proposition 1.

L−τ,−µ{ϕ}(x) =ZRd

Its kernel

(77)

(78)

is given by

with k−τ being the Fourier multiplier of L−τ , which satisﬁesbk−τ (ω) = hωi−τ .

According to Proposition 1, the operator L−τ,−µ+µ0 is an isometry from L2(Rd) to W τ

µ0). Therefore, we have the equivalences

2 (Rd; µ−

I : W τ

2 (Rd; µ) → L2(Rd; µ0) is HS ⇔ I : W τ

2 (Rd; µ − µ0) → L2(Rd; µ0) is HS

There HS means Hilbert-Schmidt. The last condition in (79) is equivalent with the condition
[31, Theorem VI.23]

⇔ L−τ,−µ+µ0 : L2(Rd) → L2(Rd) is HS.

(79)

Moreover, by the change of variable z = (y − x) and using Parseval relation,

k−τ,−µ+µ0(·, ·) ∈ L2(Rd × Rd).

Therefore, kτ,µ−µ0 is square-integrable if and only if (µ − µ0) > d/2 and τ > d/2. By choosing
µ0 close to d(1/β0 − 1/2), we ﬁnally obtain that w ∈ W −τ

6 Lévy White Noises on Weighted Besov Spaces

We investigate here the Besov smoothness of Lévy white noises over the complete space Rd.
p,q(Rd), since their is no decay
The paths of a nontrivial white noise w are never included in Bτ
at inﬁnity. For this reason, and as for Sobolev spaces, we consider the weighted Besov spaces,
introduced in Section 2.2. The main course of this section is to prove Theorem 3. .

Theorem 3. Consider a Lévy white noise w with Blumenthal-Getoor indices β0 > 0 and β∞.
Let 0 < p, q ≤ ∞, τ, µ ∈ R. If

µ >

d

min(p, β0)

and τ > d(cid:18)1 −

1

max(p, β∞)(cid:19) ,

(84)

then w ∈ B−τ

p,q (Rd; −µ) a.s.

Proof. We start with some preliminary remarks.

16

• First of all, it is suﬃcient to prove (84) for p = q, the other cases being deduced by
the embedding relations B−τ +ǫ
p,q (Rd; −µ) already seen in (35). Therefore, a
diﬀerent parameter q can always be absorbed at the cost of an arbitrarily small smoothness,
which is still possible in our case since the condition on τ in (84) is a strict inequality. For
the same reason, it is admissible to consider that p < ∞.

(Rd; −µ) ⊆ B−τ

p,p

• Second, we know from Proposition 8 that, for a ﬁxed ǫ > 0 and with probability 1,

w ∈ W −d/2−ǫ

2

(cid:18)Rd; −

d
β0

− ǫ(cid:19) .

(85)

From now, we ﬁx p = q, τ, µ. We can apply Proposition 4 with τ0 = −d/2 − ǫ and
µ0 = d( 1
2 ) + ǫ. We set u according to (38) and consider (ψj,G,m) a wavelet basis with
β0
regularity u thereafter.

− 1

First case: β∞ < β0 or β∞ = β0 ∈ I0T I∞ We ﬁx p < β ∈ I∞T I0. We are by assumption in

the conditions of Corollary 1. In particular, Corollary 2 applies: The random variable hw, ϕi is
well-deﬁned for any ϕ ∈ Lβ(Rd). In particular, since β ∈ (0, 2], the Daubechies wavelets ψj,G,m,
which are compactly supported and in L2(Rd), are in Lβ(Rd), so that the random variables
hw, ψj,G,mi are well-deﬁned and (59) is applicable to them. We shall show that w ∈ B−τ
p,p (Rd; −µ)
a.e. if

To show that w ∈ B−τ

p,p (Rd; −µ) with probability 1, it is suﬃcient to show that

µ > d/p and τ > d(1 − 1/β).

corresponds to (84) for p < β0. Finally, the case p ≥ β0 is deduced from the result for p < β0
(by considering values of p arbitrarily close to β0) and the embedding (32).

Second case: general (β0, β∞) A white noise w can be decomposed as

w = w1 + w2,

(94)

where w1 and w2 are independent, w1 is a compound-Poisson white noise, and w2 is ﬁnite-
variance. To see that, we invoke the Lévy-Itô decomposition, see for instance [35, Chapter 4].
It means in particular that β0(w1) = β0 > 0 and β∞(w1) = 0. Therefore, w1 is covered by
the ﬁrst case. Moreover, β∞(w2) = β∞ and β0(w2) = 2 ∈ I0(w2). Again, w2 is covered by the
ﬁrst case. Indeed, it is obvious if β∞ < 2. But if β∞ = 2, we have that β∞(w2) = β0(w2) =
p,q (Rd; −µ)
under the conditions (84). Besov spaces being linear spaces, these conditions are also suﬃcient
for w.

2 ∈ I0(w2)T I∞(w2). Hence, w is the sum of two processes w1 and w2 that are in B−τ

7 Lévy White Noises on Local Besov Spaces

The space of inﬁnitely smooth and compactly supported functions is denoted by D(Rd).
Its
topological dual is D′(Rd), the space of generalized functions, not necessarily tempered.
In
the same way that we deﬁned generalized random processes over S ′(Rd), we can also deﬁne
generalized random processes over D′(Rd). This is actually the original approach of Gelfand and
Vilenkin in [16]. As we brieﬂy saw in Section 2.1, the class of Lévy white noises over D′(Rd) is
strictly larger than the one over S ′(Rd). A Lévy white noise over D′(Rd) is also in S ′(Rd) if and
only if its Lévy exponent satisﬁes the Schwartz condition [9] or, equivalently, if and only if its
Blumenthal-Getoor index β0 is not 0. Until now, we have only considered Lévy white noises for
which β0 6= 0. Since we shall now focus on the local Besov smoothness of Lévy white noises, the
two equivalent conditions are now superﬂuous.

The weighted and local Besov regularities are linked according to Proposition 9.

Proposition 9. Let τ, µ ∈ R, 0 < p, q ≤ ∞. We have the continuous embedding

p,q (Rd).

The local regularity of Lévy white noise is directly obtained from the previous results, essen-
tially up to the case of compound-Poisson noise with β0 = 0. Before stating the main result of
this section, we therefore have to analyze the compound-Poisson case.

Deﬁnition 7. A compound-Poisson white noise is a Lévy white noise with a Lévy exponent of
the form

(96)

f (ξ) = exp(cid:16)λ(bPjump(ξ) − 1)(cid:17) ,

where λ > 0 is called the Poisson parameter and Pjump is a probability law on R\{0} called the
law of jumps.

Compound-Poisson random variables are inﬁnitely divisible [35], so that (96) deﬁnes a valid

Lévy exponent.

Lemma 5. Let τ ∈ R and 0 < p, q ≤ ∞. Consider a compound-Poisson noise w. If

τ > d(cid:18)1 −

1

p(cid:19) ,

(97)

then w ∈ B−τ,loc

p,q

(Rd).

Proof. Let λ and Pjump be the Poisson parameter and the law of jumps of w, respectively. The
compound-Poisson noise w can be written as [46, Theorem 1]

w =Xn∈N

akδ(· − xk),

(98)

where (ak) are i.i.d. with law Pjump and (xk) are such that the number of xk in any Borelian
B ∈ Rd is a Poisson random variable with parameter λµ(B), µ denoting the Lebesgue measure
on Rd. For ϕ ∈ D(Rd), the function ϕ being compactly supported, the generalized random

process w × ϕ =Pn∈N anϕ(xn)δ(· − xn) is almost surely a ﬁnite sum of shifted Dirac functions.

Hence, it has the Besov regularity of a single Dirac function, which is precisely (97); see [39, p.
164].

Corollary 3. Let 0 < p, q ≤ ∞, τ ∈ R. Consider a Lévy white noise w with indices β0, β∞. If

τ > d(cid:18)

1

max(p, β∞)

− 1(cid:19) ,

(99)

then w ∈ B−τ,loc

p,q

(Rd) a.s.

Proof. The case β0 > 0 is a direct consequence of Theorem 3 and Proposition 9. Let assume
now that β0 = 0. Again, we can split w as w1 + w2, where w1 is compound-Poisson and w2 is
ﬁnite-variance. For w2, we can still apply Theorem 3. We can therefore restrict our attention to
the case of compound-Poisson noises with β0 = 0. But we have seen that the compound-Poisson
case—regardless of β0— was covered in Lemma 5. Since β∞ = 0 for compound-Poisson noises,
Lemma 5 is consistent with (99), ﬁnishing the proof.

8 Discussion and Examples

8.1 Discussion and Comparison with Known Results

It is noteworthy to observe that Sections 5 and 6,
Sobolev regularity of Lévy white noises
while based on very diﬀerent techniques, give exactly the same results when applied to Sobolev
spaces. Indeed, applying Theorem 3 with p = q = 2, we recover exactly (71) due to the relations
min(2, β0) = β0 and max(2, β∞) = 2. Theorem 3 is therefore the generalization of Proposition
8, from Sobolev to Besov spaces.

Interestingly, the Sobolev smoothness parameter τ of a Lévy white noise does not depend
on the noise: The universal suﬃcient condition is τ > d/2. Moreover, we conjecture that this
2 (Rd; µ) with probability 1 for τ ≥ d/2 for
condition is also necessary, in the sense that w /∈ W τ
any µ and any white noise w. The situation is diﬀerent when considering Besov smoothness for
p 6= 2.

Hölder regularity of Lévy white noises We obtain the Hölder regularity of a white noise
by setting p = q = ∞ in Theorem 3. Because min(∞, β0) = β0 and max(∞, β∞) = ∞, we
deduce Corollary 4.

Corollary 4. The Lévy white noise w with Blumenthal-Getoor indices β0 > 0 and β∞ is in the
weighted Hölder space H −τ (Rd; −µ) if

µ > d/β0,

τ > d.

(100)

As for the Sobolev regularity, the Hölder regularity of a Lévy noise that we obtained is
independent of the noise. However, the Gaussian white noise has a local Hölder regularity of
(−τ ) for every τ > d
2 [48]. It means that our bounds for the regularity are suboptimal for the
Gaussian white noise. By contrast with the Gaussian case, we conjecture that the condition
τ > d is optimal for non-Gaussian Lévy white noises.

The regularity of Lévy white noises for general p Fixing the parameters p = q > 0, we
deﬁne

τp(w) = min{τ ∈ R, w ∈ B−τ,loc

p,p

(Rd) a.s.}.

(101)

The quantity τp(w) measures the regularity of the Lévy white noise w for the Lp-(quasi-)norm.

1

max(p,β∞) − 1(cid:17), a quantity that does not depend

(102)

on β0. We conjecture that

In Corollary 3, we have seen that τp(w) ≤ d(cid:16)
τp(w) = d(cid:18)

1

max(p, β∞)

− 1(cid:19)

for non-Gaussian white noises. If this is true, then the quantity max(p, β∞) is a measure of the
regularity of a Lévy white noise for the Lp-(quasi-)norm.

We summarize the local results of Corollary 3 with the diagram of Figure 1. We use the
classical (1/p, τ )-representation, which is most convenient for visualization. We indeed see in
(102) that the parameters 1/p and τ are linked with a linear relation for p ≤ β∞.

Weights and Lévy white noises As for the regularity, we can deﬁne for p = q > 0 the
optimal weight

µp(w) = min{µ ∈ R, ∃τ ∈ R, w ∈ B−τ

p,p (Rd; µ) a.s.}.

According to Theorem 3, we have that µp(w) ≤

d

min(p,β0) . We conjecture that

µp(w) =

d

min(p, β0)

(104)

for every white noise w.

If this conjecture is true, then µ∞(w) = 1/β0. When β0 goes to 0, we need stronger and
stronger weights to include the Lévy white noise into the corresponding Hölder space. The limit
case is β0 = 0 for which we only have local results. Indeed, polynomial weights are not increasing
fast enough to compensate the erratic behavior of the white noise. This is consistent with the
fact that a Lévy white noise with β0 = 0 is not tempered [9].

8.2 Besov Regularity of Some Speciﬁc Lévy White Noises

We apply our results to speciﬁc Lévy white noises. We start by recalling the Blumenthal-Getoor
indices of the considered white noises. We gives in Table 1 the Lévy exponent and the probability
density of the underlying inﬁnitely divisible law, when they can be expressed in a closed form.
All the considered distributions are known to be inﬁnitely divisible. For Gaussian, SαS, or
compound-Poisson noises, this can be easily seen from the deﬁnition. For the others, it is a
non-trivial fact, and we refer to [35] for more details and references to the adequate literature.
We moreover remark that any combination of β0 and β∞ is possible, as stated in Proposition

10.

Proposition 10. For every β0, β∞ ∈ [0, 2], there exists a Lévy white noise with Blumenthal-
Getoor indices β0 and β∞.

Figure 2: Besov localization of speciﬁc Lévy white noises. A white noise is almost surely in a
given Besov space Bτ,loc

p,q (Rd) if (1/p, τ ) is located in the shaded region.

Proof. We ﬁrst recall that a Lévy exponent can be uniquely represents by its Lévy triplet
(µ, σ2, ν) as [35, Theorem 8.1]

f (ξ) = iµξ −

σ2ξ2

2

+ZR\{0}

(eiξx − 1 − iξx1|x|≤1)ν(dx),

(105)

where µ ∈ R, σ2 ≥ 0, and ν is a Lévy measure, that is, a measure on R\{0} such that

RR\{0} inf(1, x2)ν(dx) < ∞. When µ = σ2 = 0 and ν is symmetric, the Lévy white noise

with Lévy triplet (0, 0, ν) has Blumenthal-Getoor indices given by [10, Section 3.1]

β∞ = inf

β0 = sup

p∈[0,2](Z|x|≤1
p∈[0,2](Z|x|>1

|x|pν(dx) < ∞) ,
|x|pν(dx) < ∞) .

For 0 < β0 ≤ 2 and 0 ≤ β∞ < 2, we set

νβ0(x) = |x|−(β0+1)

1|x|>1,

νβ∞(x) = |x|−(β∞+1)

1|x|≤1.

22

(106)

Moreover, for β0 = 0 and β∞ = 2, we set

ν0(x) = log−2(1 + |x|)|x|−1

1|x|>1,

ν2(x) = log−1/2(1 + |x|)|x|−3

1|x|≤1.

For 0 ≤ β0, β∞ ≤ 2 and deﬁning νβ∞
β0

= νβ0 + νβ∞, we see easily that

is a Lévy measure. Based on (106), we also see that the associated indices are β0

8.3 Conclusion

We derived new results on the Besov regularity of general multidimensional Lévy white noises.
We have shown that the local regularity depends on the Blumenthal-Getoor index β∞ which
measures the behavior of the Lévy exponent at inﬁnity. The global regularity over the complete
space Rd requires the introduction of polynomial weights. We have shown that the second
Blumenthal-Getoor index β0 characterizes the weight parameter. Finally, we applied our results
to speciﬁc white noises.
