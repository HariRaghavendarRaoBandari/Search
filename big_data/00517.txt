Abstract. For two graphs, G and F , and an integer r ě 2 we write G Ñ pF qr if
every r-coloring of the edges of G results in a monochromatic copy of F .
In 1995,
the ﬁrst two authors established a threshold edge probability for the Ramsey property
Gpn, pq Ñ pF qr, where Gpn, pq is a random graph obtained by including each edge of
the complete graph on n vertices, independently, with probability p. The original proof
was based on the regularity lemma of Szemerédi and this led to tower-type dependencies
between the involved parameters. Here, for r “ 2, we provide a self-contained proof
of a quantitative version of the Ramsey threshold theorem with only double exponential
dependencies between the constants. As a corollary we obtain a double exponential upper
bound on the 2-color Folkman numbers. By a diﬀerent proof technique, a similar result
was obtained independently by Conlon and Gowers.

§1. Introduction

For two graphs, G and F , and an integer r ě 2 we write G Ñ pFqr if every r-coloring of
the edges of G results in a monochromatic copy of F . By a copy we mean here a subgraph

of G isomorphic to F . Let Gpn, pq be the binomial random graph, where each of `n
2˘

possible edges is present, independently, with probability p. In [4] the ﬁrst two authors
established a threshold edge probability for the Ramsey property Gpn, pq Ñ pFqr.

For a graph F , let vF and eF stand for, respectively, the number of vertices and edges

of F . Assuming eF ě 1, deﬁne

The original proof of Theorem 1 was based on the regularity lemma of Szemerédi [7] and

this led to tower-type dependencies of the involved parameters. In [5] it was noticed that

for two colors the usage of the regularity lemma could be replaced by a simple Ramsey-
type argument. Here we follow that thread and for r “ 2 prove a quantitative version of
Theorem 1 with only double exponential dependencies between the constants.

In order to state the result, we ﬁrst deﬁne inductively four parameters indexed by the

number of edges of a k-vertex graph F . For ﬁxed k ě 3 we set

Note that, for r “ 2, Theorem 1 is an immediate corollary of Theorem 2.

Another consequence of Theorem 2 concerns Folkman numbers. Given an integer k ě 3,
the Folkman number fpkq is the smallest integer n for which there exists an n-vertex
graph G such that G Ñ pKkq2 but G Č Kk`1. In the special case of F “ Kk and r “ 2,
Theorem 2, with p “ Cpk
In
Section 4, by a standard application of the FKG inequality, we also estimate from below
PpGpn, pq Č Kk`1q, so that the sum of the two probabililities is strictly greater than 1.
This, after a careful analysis of the involved constants, provides a self-contained derivation
of a double exponential bound for fpkq.
Corollary 3. There exists an absolute constant c ą 0 such that for every k ě 3

k`1 , provides a lower bound on PpGpn, pq Ñ pKkq2q.

.

Independently, a similar double exponential bound (with arbitrarily many colors) was

obtained by Conlon and Gowers [1]. The method used in [1] is quite diﬀerent from ours

and allows for a further generalization to hypergraphs. After Theorem 2 as well as the

result in [1] had been proved, we learned that Nenadov and Steger [3] have found a new

proof of Theorem 1 by means of the celebrated containers’ method. In [6], we used the
ideas from [3] to obtain the bound fpkq ď 2Opk4 log kq which, at least for large k, supersedes
Colorary 3. However, the advantage of our approach here is that the proofs of both

Theorem 2 and Corollary 3, as opposed to those in [6], are self-contained and, in case of

Theorem 2, incorporate the original ideas from [4].

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 3 we prove our main result, Theorem 2.

This is preceded by Section 2 collecting preliminary results needed in the main body of

the proof. Section 4 is devoted to a proof of Corollary 3

§2. Preliminary results

Before we start with the proof of Theorem 2, we need to recall abridged versions of

two useful facts from [2, Lemmas 2.52 and 2.51] (see also [4, 5]), which we formulate as

Propositions 4 and 5 below.

Given a set Γ and a real number p, 0 ď p ď 1, let Γp be the random binomial subset of Γ,
that is, a subset obtained by independently including each element of Γ with probability p.

Further, given an increasing family Q of subsets of a set Γ and an integer h, we denote
by Qh the subfamily of Q consisting of the sets A P Q having the property that all subsets
of A with at least |A| ´ h elements still belong to Q.

Proposition 4. Let 0 ă c ă 1, δ “ c2{9, N p ě 72{δ2 “ 2336{c4, and h “ δN p{2. Then
for every increasing family Q of subsets of an N -element set Γ the following holds. If

then

P`Γp1´δqp R Q˘ ď expp´cN pq
PpΓp R Qhq ď expp´δ2N p{9q .

Proof. We shall apply [2, Lemma 2.52], which is very similar to Proposition 4. Lemma 2.52
from [2] states that if c and δ ą 0 satify

δp3 ` logp1{δqq ď c

(6)

and

then

PpΓp1´δqp R Qq ď expp´cN pq

PpΓp R Qhq ď 3aN p expp´cN p{2q ` expp´δ2N p{8q .
To this end we ﬁrst note that by assumption of Proposition 4 we have δ ă 1{9. Since
?xplogp1{xq is increasing for x P p0, 1{e2s it follows for every δ ď 1{9 that

(7)

?δ logp1{δq ď

3 ď 2 .

Consequently, ?δp3`logp1{δqq ď 3 and owing to the assumption δ “ c2{9 this is equivalent
to (6). Moreover, since N p ě 2336{c4 ą p12{cq2 we have

3aN p ď expp3aN pq ď exppcN p{4q .

Hence, (7) yields

PpΓp R Qhq ď expp´cN p{4q ` expp´δ2N p{8q ď 2 expp´δ2N p{8q

ď expp´δ2N p{8 ` 1q ď expp´δ2N p{9q,
where the last inequality follows by our assumption N p ě 72{δ2.

In the proof of Theorem 2 we will also use an elementary fact about p̺, dq-dense graphs.
For constants ̺ and d with 0 ă d, ̺ ď 1 we call an n-vertex graph Γ p̺, dq-dense if every
induced subgraph on m ě ̺n vertices contains at least dpm2{2q edges. It follows by an
easy averaging argument that it suﬃces to check the above inequality only for m “ r̺ns.
Note also that every induced subgraph of a p̺, dq-dense n-vertex graph on at least cn
vertices is p ̺

It turns out that for a suitable choice of the parameters, p̺, dq-dense graphs enjoy a
Ramsey-like property. For a two-coloring of (the edges of) Γ we call a sequence of vertices
pv1, . . . , vℓq canonical if for each i “ 1, . . . , ℓ ´ 1 all the edges tvi, vju, for j ą i are of the
same color.

Proposition 6. For every ℓ ě 2 and d P p0, 1q, if n ě 2p4{dqℓ´2 and 0 ă ̺ ď pd{4qℓ´2{2,
then every two-colored n-vertex p̺, dq-dense graph Γ contains at least

canonical sequences of length ℓ.

Proof. First, note that as long as ̺ ď 1{2 every p̺, dq-dense graph contains at least n{2
vertices with degrees at least dn{2. Indeed, otherwise a set of m “ rpn ` 1q{2s vertices of
degrees smaller than dn{2 would induce less than mdn{4 ď dpm2{2q edges, a contradiction.
We prove Proposition 6 by induction on ℓ. For ℓ “ 2, every ordered pair of adjacent

Assume that the proposition is true for some ℓ ě 2 and consider an n-vertex p̺, dq-dense
graph Γ, where ̺ ď pd{4qℓ´1{2 and n ě 2p4{dqℓ´1. As observed above, there is a set U of
at least n{2 vertices with degrees at least dn{2. Fix one vertex u P U and let Mu be a set
of at least dn{4 neighbors of u connected to u by edges of the same color. Let Γu “ ΓrMus
be the subgraph of Γ induced by the set Mu. Note that Γu has nu ě dn{4 ě 2p4{dqℓ´2
vertices and is p̺u, dq-dense with ̺u ď pd{4qℓ´2{2. Hence, by the induction assumption,

Corollary 7. For every k ě 2, every graph F on k vertices, and every d P p0, 1q, if
n ě p4{dq2k and 0 ă ̺ ď pd{4q2k, then every two-colored n-vertex, p̺, dq-dense graph Γ
contains at least γnk monochromatic copies of F , where γ “ d2k2
Proof. Every canonical sequence pv1, . . . , v2k´2q contains a monochromatic copy of Kk.
Indeed, among the vertices v1, . . . , v2k´3, some k´1 have the same color on all the “forward”
edges. Therefore, these vertices together with vertex v2k´2 form a monochromatic copy

of Kk. On the other hand, every such copy is contained in no more than k!`2k´2

p2k ´ 2qknk´2 canonical sequences of length 2k ´ 2. Finally, every copy of Kk contains at
least one copy of F , and diﬀerent copies of Kk contain diﬀerent copies of F . Consequently,

§3. Proof of Theorem 2

3.1. Preparations and outline. For given n P N, p P p0, 1q, and a k-vertex graph F we
denote by XF the random variable counting the number of copies of F in Gpn, pq. We also
recall that µF “ EXF .

For ﬁxed k ě 3 we prove Theorem 2 by induction on eF . We may assume n ě k, as for

n ă k we have µF “ 0 and there is nothing to prove.
Base case. Let F1 be a graph consisting of one edge and k ´ 2 isolated vertices. Note that
mF1 “ 1{2 (see (2)) and for every two-coloring of the edges of Gpn, pq every copy of F1 in
Gpn, pq is monochromatic. Clearly,

Thus, by Chernoﬀ’s bound (see, e.g., [2, ineq. (2.6)]) we have

which holds for any values of p and n. Hence, Theorem 2 follows for F “ F1 and with the
constants a1 “ 1{2, b1 “ 1{8, and C1 “ n1 “ 1 as given in (3).

Inductive step. Given a graph G, an edge f of G and a nonedge e, that is an edge of
the complement of G, we denote by G ´ f a graph obtained from G by removing f , and
by G` f a graph ontained by adding e to G. Let Fi`1 be a graph with i` 1 ě 2 edges and
maximum degree ∆pFi`1q ě 2. If i`1 ě 3, then we can remove one edge from Fi`1 in such
a way that the resulting graph Fi still contains at least one vertex of degree at least two,
i.e., ∆pFiq ě 2. If i` 1 “ 2, the graph Fi`1 “ F2 consists of a path of length two and k´ 3
isolated vertices and removing any of the two edges results in the graph Fi “ F1. In either
case, we may ﬁx an edge f P EpFi`1q such that the graph Fi “ Fi`1 ´ f is k-admissible.
Hence, we can assume that Theorem 2 holds for Fi and for the constants ai, bi, Ci, and ni
inductively deﬁned by (3) and (4).

We have to show that Theorem 2 holds for Fi`1 and constants ai`1, bi`1, Ci`1, and ni`1
given in (4). To this end, let n ě ni`1 and p ě Ci`1n´1{mFi`1 . We will expose the random
graph Gpn, pq in two independent rounds Gpn, pIq and Gpn, pIIq and have

Gpn, pq “ Gpn, pIq Y Gpn, pIIq .

For that, we will ﬁx pI and pII as follows. First we ﬁx auxiliary constants1

(10)

Outline. At ﬁrst we consider a two-coloring χ, with colors red and blue, of the edges
of Gpn, pIq (the so-called ﬁrst round). Owing to the induction assumption (Theorem 2
for Fi) we note that with high probability the coloring χ yields many monochromatic copies
of Fi. We will say that an unordered pair of vertices e “ tu, vu is χ-rich if Gpn, pIq ` e
possesses “many” (to be deﬁned later) copies of Fi`1, in which e plays the role of the
edge f and the rest is a monochromatic copy of Fi. Let Γχ be an auxiliary graph of all
χ-rich pairs. We will show that with ‘high’ probability (to be speciﬁed later), Γχ is, in
fact, p̺, dq-dense for d and ̺ as in (8) (Claim 8).

1The proof requires several auxiliary constants which at ﬁrst may appear a bit unmotivated. For
example, we now deﬁne δII, while δI is to be deﬁned only later. Both δ’s will be used in applications of
Proposition 4.

8

VOJTĚCH RÖDL, ANDRZEJ RUCIŃSKI, AND MATHIAS SCHACHT

To this end, note that if the monochromatic copies of Fi were clustered at relatively
few pairs, then we might fall short of proving Claim 8. However, we will show that in
the random graph Gpn, pIq it is unlikely that many copies of Fi share the same pair of
vertices. For that, we will consider the distribution of the graphs T consisting of two
copies of Fi which share the vertices of a missing edge f (and possibly other vertices).
We will show that the number of those copies is of the same order of magnitude as its

expectation (Fact 9), and will also require that this holds with high probability. Such a

sharp concentration result is known to be false, but Proposition 5 asserts that it can be
obtained on the cost of removing a few edges of Gpn, pIq.

The auxiliary graph Γχ is naturally two-colored (by azure and pink), since every χ-rich
pair closes either many blue or many red copies of Fi (or both and then we pick the
color for that edge, azure or blue, arbitrarily). Consequently, Corollary 7 yields many
monochromatic copies of Fi`1 in Γχ and at least half of them are colored, say, pink.
That is, there are many copies of Fi`1 in Γχ such that each of their edges closes many
red copies of Fi in Gpn, pIq under the coloring χ. By Janson’s inequality combined with
Proposition 4, with high probability, many pink copies will be still present in ΓχXGpn, pIIq
(second round) even after a fraction of edges is deleted. Thus, we are facing a ‘win-win’
scenario. Namely, if an extension of χ colors only few pink edges of Γχ X Gpn, pIIq red
then, by the above, many copies of Fi`1 in Γχ X Gpn, pIIq have to be colored completely
blue. Otherwise, many pink edges of Γχ X Gpn, pIIq are red, which, by the deﬁnition of a
pink edge, results in many red copies of Fi`1 in Gpn, pq.
Useful estimates. For the veriﬁcation of several inequalities in the proof, it will be useful
to appeal to the following lower bounds for γ, α, and ̺ in terms of powers of ai and 2.

First round. As outlined above, in the ﬁrst round we want to show that with high probabil-

By the induction assumption, if ̺n ě ni and pi ě Cip̺nq´1{mFi then, with high probability,
there are many monochromatic copies of Fi in GpU, pIq. For technical reasons that will
become clear only later, we want to strengthen the above Ramsey property so that it is

resilient to deletion of a small fraction of edges. For that we apply the induction assumption
to the random graph GpU,p1 ´ δIqpIq, followed by an application of Propositions 4. We
begin by verifying the assumptions of Theorem 2 with respect to Fi and GpU,p1 ´ δIqpIq.

Our goal is to show that, with high probability, any two-coloring χ of GpU, pIq yields
at least dp|U|2{2q χ-rich edges, and ultimately, by repeating this argument for every set
U Ď rns with ̺n vertices, that Γχ is p̺, dq-dense. The above ‘robust’ Ramsey property
(23) means that after applying Proposition 5 to GpU, pIq the resulting subgraph of GpU, pIq
will still have the Ramsey property with high probability.

Let Y be the random variable counting the number of double creatures in GpU, pIq. It

follows from Fact 9 that

Second round. Let B be the conjunction of E and the event that |Gpn, pIq| ď n2pI. In the

Formally, let A be the (bad) event that there is a two-coloring of the edges of Gpn, pq with
fewer than ai`1µFi`1 monochromatic copies of Fi`1. (That is,  A is the Ramsey property

The edges of Γχ are naturally two-colored according to the majority color among the
monochromatic copies of Fi attached to them. We color an edge of Γχ pink if it closes
at least ℓ{2 red copies of Fi and we color it azure otherwise. Subsequently, we apply
Corollary 7 to Γχ for Fi`1 and d (chosen in (8)). Note that in (8) we chose ̺ to facilitate
such an application. Moreover, the required lower bound on n is equivalent to ̺n ě 1
and this follows from (17). Hence, by Corollary 7 and the choice of γ in (8), we may
assume without loss of generality, that there are at least γnk{2 pink copies of Fi`1 in Γχ.
In particular, all these copies of Fi`1 consist entirely of edges closing each at least ℓ{2
red copies of Fi (from the ﬁrst round). Let us denote by Fχ the family of these copies
of Fi`1, and let Γpink
be the subgraph of Γχ containing the pink edges. Since every edge
may belong to at most nk´2 copies of Fi`1, we have
