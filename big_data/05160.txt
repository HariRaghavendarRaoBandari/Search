Abstract. Large scale surveys of Andromeda’s resolved stellar populations have revolutionized
our view of this galaxy over the past decade. The combination of large-scale, contiguous photo-
metric surveys and pointed spectroscopic surveys has been particularly powerful for discovering
substructure and disentangling the structural components of Andromeda. The SPLASH (Spec-
troscopic and Photometric Landscape of Andromeda’s Stellar Halo) survey consists of broad-
and narrow-band imaging and spectroscopy of red giant branch stars in lines of sight ranging in
distance from 2 kpc to more than 200 kpc from Andromeda’s center. The SPLASH data reveal
a power-law surface brightness proﬁle extending to at least two-thirds of Andromeda’s virial ra-
dius (Gilbert et al. 2012), a metallicity gradient extending to at least 100 kpc from Andromeda’s
center (Gilbert et al. 2014), and evidence of a signiﬁcant population of heated disk stars in An-
dromeda’s inner halo (Dorman et al. 2013). We are also using the velocity distribution of halo
stars to measure the tangential motion of Andromeda (Beaton et al., in prep).

1. Introduction

The Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31) provide the two best opportunities for in
depth studies of stellar halos. Moreover, they provide complementary perspectives. While
our internal vantage point provides us with exquisite detail of the inner halo of the MW,
it is diﬃcult to study the outer halo due to the large distance uncertainties, low stellar
densities and vast survey areas required for even a partial view of the halo. Conversely,
our external vantage point provides a global view of the halo of Andromeda. While
Andromeda’s distance has historically precluded measurements that are commonplace for
the MWs halo, the last decade has seen tremendous progress. This has largely been due to
the photometric and spectroscopic observations obtained by the SPLASH (Spectroscopic
and Photometric Landscape of Andromeda’s Stellar Halo) and PAndAS (Pan-Andromeda
Archaeological Survey; McConnachie et al. 2009) collaborations.

The SPLASH collaboration has utilized the Mosaic camera on the Kitt Peak 4 m
Mayall Telescope to obtain broad-band (M and T2) and narrow-band (DDO51) imaging
and the DEIMOS spectrograph on the Keck II 10 m telescope to obtain spectroscopy of

individual M31 stars. The surface-gravity sensitive DDO51 imaging enables the selection
of stars that are likely to be red giants at the distance of Andromeda, greatly increasing
the eﬃciency of the spectroscopic observations. The SPLASH collaboration has imaged
78 ﬁelds and obtained > 20,000 stellar spectra in Andromeda’s disk, dwarf galaxies, and
halo, in ﬁelds ranging from 2 – 230 kpc in projected distance from Andromeda’s center.
This dataset has led to the discovery and characterization of Andromeda’s extended,
metal-poor stellar halo (Guhathakurta et al. 2005, Gilbert et al. 2006, Kalirai et al. 2006a,
& Courteau et al. 2011), and has been used to measure the global properties of the halo
(Gilbert et al. 2012 & 2014) and to characterize the inner stellar halo and disk (Dorman
et al. 2012, 2013, & 2015). It has been used to study the properties of Andromeda’s
dwarf satellites (Majewski et al. 2007, Kalirai et al. 2009, Howley et al. 2008, Kalirai
et al. 2010, Tollerud et al. 2012, Ho et al. 2012 & Howley et al. 2013), to identify and
characterize tidal debris features (Guhathakurta et al. 2006, Kalirai et al. 2006b, Gilbert
et al. 2007, 2009a, 2009b), and led to the discovery of the continuation of Andromeda’s
giant southern stream (Gilbert et al. 2007, Fardal et al. 2008, 2012).

2. Surface Brightness Proﬁle and Metallicity Gradient

SPLASH spectroscopic and photometric observations in 38 halo ﬁelds (Fig. 1) have
been combined to measure the radial surface brightness and metallicity proﬁle of An-
dromeda’s stellar halo. These lines-of-sight span all quadrants of the halo and range from
9 – 230 kpc in projected distance from Andromeda’s center. The stellar spectra were
used to identify secure samples of Andromeda red giant branch stars (removing Milky
Way dwarf star contaminants; Gilbert et al. 2006) and to identify stars associated with
kinematically cold tidal debris features (Gilbert et al. 2007, 2009b, & 2012).

The surface brightness proﬁle of Andromeda’s stellar halo is consistent with a single

Figure 2. Surface brightness proﬁle of Andromeda’s stellar halo, with (left) and without (right)
stars associated with kinematically cold tidal debris features. Andromeda’s stellar halo is con-
sistent with a single power-law with an index of −2.2 over a radial range of 10 – 175 kpc in
projected distance from Andromeda’s center. Tidal debris features have only been identiﬁed in
ﬁelds less than 90 kpc from Andromeda’s center: the low number of Andromeda stars in the
outer halo ﬁelds (Rproj > 90 kpc) prevent identiﬁcation of multiple kinematical components.

associated with kinematically cold tidal debris features. As in Fig. 2, tidal debris features have
only been identiﬁed and removed in ﬁelds less than 90 kpc from Andromeda’s center. In the

power-law extending to a projected distance of more than 175 kpc from Andromeda’s
center (∼ 2/3 the virial radius; Fig. 2). The surface brightness proﬁle is derived from the
ratio of counts of spectroscopically conﬁrmed Andromeda red giant branch stars to Milky
Way dwarf stars (Gilbert et al. 2012). The right panel shows the surface brightness proﬁle
once tidal debris features have been removed, using the results of maximum-likelihood,
multi-Gaussian ﬁts to each ﬁeld’s velocity distribution. Tidal debris features have been
identiﬁed in half of the SPLASH spectroscopic ﬁelds within 90 kpc of Andromeda’s center.
Andromeda’s stellar halo shows clear evidence of a metallicity gradient, extending
to ∼100 kpc (Fig. 3), with a total decrease of ∼1 dex (Gilbert et al. 2014). The [Fe/H]
estimates are based on a comparison of the star’s position in the color-magnitude diagram

Figure 4. Evidence for a kicked-up disk component in Andromeda’s inner halo. Left: Compari-
son of the disk fraction from a kinematical analysis of the velocity distribution of stars (measured
fdisk) with the disk fraction favored by a model that includes unresolved surface brightness data
and the stellar luminosity function, as well as the stellar velocity distribution (model fdisk).
The disk fraction favored by the model is systematically higher than the measured dynamically
cold disk fraction, suggesting there is a population of dynamically hot (“kicked-up”) disk stars.
Right: In order to reconcile the observed stellar luminosity function and the stellar kinematics,
a fraction of the stars with a disk-like luminosity function must be dynamically hot. This panel
shows the dynamically hot fraction of disk stars as a function of radius. Vertical error bars
denote 1σ uncertainties while horizontal error bars show the full radial range of each spatial
region shown in the ﬁgure. Figures are from Dorman et al. (2013).

with stellar isochrones (assuming an age of 10 Gyr and the solar value of [α/Fe]). In the
right panel, stars that may be associated with tidal debris features have been removed,
and a gradient of −1 dex over 100 kpc in radius remains. This shows that the metallicity
gradient in Andromeda’s stellar halo is not driven by the tidal debris features included
in the SPLASH dataset. For a subset of spectra with the highest S/N, spectroscopic
estimates of [Fe/H] based on the equivalent width of the Calcium Triplet were compared
with the photometric estimates of [Fe/H]. On average the spectroscopic and photometric
estimates agree, and the same gradient in [Fe/H] with radius is found.

Broad inferences about Andromeda’s merger history can be made by comparing the
surface brightness and metallicity proﬁles to simulations of stellar halo formation. The
lack of a downward break in the surface brightness proﬁle may indicate that Andromeda
has undergone a fairly large number of recent, low-mass accretion events (Gilbert et al.
2012). The large-scale metallicity gradient extending over 100 kpc may indicate that the
majority of the stars in the halo were contributed by one to a few early, relatively massive
(∼ 109 M⊙) accretion events (see discussion in Gilbert et al. 2014). However, to make
more concrete statements about the luminosity function and time of accretion of the
satellites that formed Andromeda’s stellar halo, we will need to measure the α-element
abundances of halo stars. Vargas et al. (2014a,b) published the ﬁrst [α/Fe] measurements
of Andromeda stars (including 4 halo stars and measurements in 9 dwarf galaxies). The
SPLASH dataset provides a rich archive for measuring [α/Fe] in many more halo ﬁelds.

3. Kinematics of M31’s Inner Spheroid

Dorman et al. (2013) combined stellar kinematics from SPLASH (> 5000 spectra), the
stellar luminosity function derived from resolved HST imaging (from the PHAT survey;
Dalcanton et al. 2012), and unresolved surface photometry in Andromeda’s disk to model
the relative strength of each of the structural components (bulge, disk, and halo) as a

along two dimensions — vsys along the line-of-sight to the center of mass and vt perpendicular
to vsys — and the eﬀect of observing tracers at lines-of-sight at widely separated angles, ρ. For
a tracer at ρ ∼ 0, the line-of-sight of the center of mass and of the tracer are aligned, whereas
for ρ > 0, this is no longer the case (i.e., vlos 6= vsys) and the magnitude of the diﬀerence
depends on both the radial (ρ) and azimuthal (φ) location of the tracer. Right: Measurements
of Andromeda’s tangential motion; vW and vN are the plane of sky motions to the West and
North. Measurements from diﬀerent sources are compared: direct HST proper motions (square)
and statistical tests using the line-of-sight velocities of dwarf satellite galaxies (circles) and halo
stars (diamond). In the on-line proceedings, each point is color-coded based on the source of the

function of radius. The best-ﬁtting models favor a disk fraction that is systematically
higher than the disk fraction measured solely from an analysis of the stellar velocity
dispersion (Fig. 4). The number of stars with a disk-like luminosity function is 5.2%±2.1%
larger than the number of stars with dynamically cold, disk-like kinematics. This implies
Andromeda’s inner regions contain a population of stars with a disk-like luminosity
function but spheroid-like kinematics. This is the ﬁrst direct evidence that there are
stars that were born in Andromeda’s disk and subsequently dynamically heated into the
halo; they are now kinematically indistinguishable from Andromeda’s inner stellar halo.
The number of stars that have been dynamically heated are consistent with that expected
from simulations (see discussion in Dorman et al. 2013).

4. Tangential Motion of M31 From Halo Stars

Knowledge of the orbit of Andromeda is central to understanding the past, current,
and future dynamical state of the Local Group. This requires determining Andromeda’s
three dimensional motion, an extremely challenging measurement. Recently, Sohn et al.
(2012) used HST imaging obtained over a long time baseline to measure Andromeda’s
tangential motion via the observed proper motion of Andromeda’s stars.

Indepedent conﬁrmation of Andromeda’s transverse velocity can be made using the
kinematics of halo populations. This technique relies on the projection of the three di-
mensional center-of-mass motion on the line-of-sight motions of bound objects (Fig. 5,
left ). This technique is most powerful when applied over the large spatial baseline pro-
vided by tracer populations in Andromeda’s halo: dwarf satellites, globular clusters (van
der Marel & Guhathakurta 2008, van der Marel et al. 2012) and halo stars.

Beaton et al. (in prep) are employing the SPLASH dataset to make the ﬁrst mea-
surement of Andromeda’s tangential motion using line-of-sight velocities of individual

halo stars. We also incorporate the kinematics of Andromeda’s dwarf satellites and halo
globular clusters. Our model’s only assumption is that the tracer stars come from a sin-
gle virialized component (van der Marel & Guhathakurta 2008). Following Gilbert et
al. (2012), we exclude stars likely to belong to dwarf satellites or tidal debris features.
The greatest potential source of bias is from unidentiﬁed substructure. However, the
magnitude of this eﬀect can be estimated empirically from the data and is added to the
total uncertainty. We ﬁnd broad agreement between our measurement of Andromeda’s
tangential motion and previous measurements (Fig. 5, right ). The error-weighted mean
of all independent measurements is (vW , vN ) = (-96.4 ± 22.4 km s−1, -44.7 ± 25.4).

5. Summary

The SPLASH collaboration has obtained a rich dataset of photometric and spectro-
scopic observations spanning the Andromeda system. Among the many results from the
SPLASH survey, four have been highlighted here. This dataset has been used to measure
the surface brightness and metallicity proﬁle to two-thirds of Andromeda’s virial radius
(Gilbert et al. 2012 & 2014). In conjunction with the PHAT HST imaging of Andromeda’s
disk, it has been used to show that there is a signiﬁcant population of kicked up disk
stars in Andromeda’s inner stellar halo (Dorman et al. 2013). Finally, it is providing an
independent measurement of Andromeda’s tangential motion (Beaton et al., in prep).
