ARBORIFIED MULTIPLE ZETA VALUES

DOMINIQUE MANCHON

Abstract. We describe some particular ﬁnite sums of multiple zeta values which arise from J.
Ecalle’s ”arboriﬁcation”, a process which can be described as a surjective Hopf algebra morphism
from the Hopf algebra of decorated rooted forests onto a Hopf algebra of shuﬄes or quasi-shuﬄes.
This formalism holds for both the iterated sum picture and the iterated integral picture.
It
involves a decoration of the forests by the positive integers in the ﬁrst case, by only two colours
in the second case.

Keywords: Rooted trees; multiple zeta values; shuﬄes; quasi-shuﬄes.

1. Introduction

Multiple zeta values are deﬁned by the following nested sums:

(1)

ζ(n1, . . . , nr) := Xk1>k2>···>kr≥1

1

kn1
1 · · · knr

r

,

where the nj’s are positive integers. The nested sum (1) converges as long as n1 ≥ 2. The
integer r is the depth, whereas the sum p := n1 + · · · nr is the weight. Although the multiple zeta
values of depth one and two were already known by L. Euler, the full set of multiple zeta values
ﬁrst appears in 1981 in a preprint of Jean Ecalle under the name ”moule ζ •
<”, in the context of
resurgence theory in complex analysis [13, Page 429], together with its companion ζ •
≤ now known
as the set of multiple star zeta values. The systematic study begins a decade later with the works
of M. E. Hoﬀman [19] and D. Zagier [28]. It has been remarked by M. Kontsevich ([28], see also
the intriguing precursory Remark 4 on Page 431 in [13]) that multiple zeta values admit another
representation by iterated integrals, namely:

(2)

ζ(n1, . . . , nr) =Z · · ·Z0≤up≤···u1≤1

du1

ϕ1(u1)

· · ·

dup

ϕp(up)

,

with ϕj(u) = 1 − u if j ∈ {n1, n1 + n2, n1 + n2 + n3, . . . , p} and ϕj(u) = u otherwise. For later
use we set:

f0(u) := u,

f1(u) := 1 − u.

Iterated integral representation (2) is the starting point to the modern approach in terms of mixed
Tate motives over Z, already outlined in [28] and widely developed in the literature since then
[25, 10, 2, 3, 4]. Multiple zeta values verify a lot of polynomial relations with integer coeﬃcients:
the representation (1) by nested sums leads to quasi-shuﬄe relations, whereas representation (2) by
iterated integrals leads to shuﬄe relations. A third family of relations, the regularization relations,
comes from a subtle interplay between the two ﬁrst groups of relations, involving divergent multiple
zeta sums ζ(1, n2 . . . nr). A representative example of each family (in the order above) is given

It is convenient to write multiple zeta values in terms of words. In view of representations (1)

and (2), this can be done in two diﬀerent ways. We consider the two alphabets:

X := {x0, x1},

Y := {y1, y2, y3, . . .},

and we denote by X ∗ (resp. Y ∗) the set of words with letters in X (resp. Y ). The vector space
QhXi freely generated by X ∗ is a commutative algebra for the shuﬄe product, which is deﬁned
by:

(v1 · · · vp) ∐∐ (vp+1 · · · vp+q) := Xσ∈Sh(p,q)

vσ−1

1

· · · vσ−1

p+q

with vj ∈ X, j ∈ {1, . . . , p + q}. Here, Sh(p, q) is the set of (p, q)-shuﬄes, i.e. permutations σ of
{1, . . . p + q} such that σ1 < · · · σp and σp+1 < · · · < σp+q. The vector space QhY i freely generated
by Y ∗ is a commutative algebra for the quasi-shuﬄe product, which is deﬁned as follows: a (p, q)-
quasi-shuﬄe of type r is a surjection σ : {1, . . . p + q} →→ {1, . . . p + q − r} such that σ1 < · · · σp and
σp+1 < · · · < σp+q. Denoting by Qsh(p, q; r) the set of (p, q)-quasi-shuﬄes of type r, the formula
for the quasi-shuﬄe product ∐∐-

is:

(w1 · · · wp) ∐∐- (wp+1 · · · wp+q) :=Xr≥0 Xσ∈Qsh(p,q;r)

wσ

1 · · · wσ

p+q−r

with wj ∈ Y , j ∈ {1, . . . , p + q}, and where wσ
j is the internal product of the letters in the set
σ−1({j}), which contains one or two elements. The internal product is deﬁned by [ykyl] := yk+l.

We denote by Y ∗

conv the submonoid of words w = w1 · · · wr with w1 6= y1, and we set X ∗

x0X ∗x1. An injective monoid morphism is given by changing letter yn into the word xn−1
namely:

conv =
0 x1,

s : Y ∗ −→ X ∗

yn1 · · · ynr

and restricts to a monoid isomorphism from Y ∗
conv
are two convenient ways to symbolize convergent multiple zeta values through representations (1)
and (2) respectively. The following notation is commonly adopted:

conv. As notation suggests, Y ∗

conv onto X ∗

conv and X ∗

and extended to ﬁnite linear combinations of convergent words by linearity. The relation:

ζ∐∐- (yn1 · · · ynr ) := ζ(n1, . . . nr) =: ζ∐∐(cid:0)s(yn1 · · · ynr )(cid:1),

(6)

(7)

(8)

is obviously veriﬁed. The quasi-shuﬄe relations then write:

(9)

ζ∐∐- (w ∐∐- w′) = ζ∐∐- (w)ζ∐∐- (w′)

ζ∐∐- = ζ∐∐ ◦ s

for any w, w′ ∈ Y ∗

conv, whereas the shuﬄe relations write:

ARBORIFIED MULTIPLE ZETA VALUES

3

ζ∐∐ (v ∐∐ v′) = ζ∐∐ (v)ζ∐∐ (v′)

(10)
for any v, v′ ∈ X ∗
conv. By ﬁxing an arbitrary value θ to ζ(1) and setting ζ∐∐- (y1) = ζ∐∐ (x1) = θ, it
is possible to extend ζ∐∐- , resp. ζ∐∐ , to all words in Y ∗, resp. to X ∗x1, such that (9), resp. (10),
still holds. It is also possible to extend ζ∐∐ to a map deﬁned on X ∗ by ﬁxing an arbitrary value
θ′ to ζ∐∐ (x0), such that (10) is still valid. We will stick to θ′ = θ for symmetry reasons, reﬂecting
the following formal equality between two inﬁnite quantities:

Z 1

0

dt
t

=Z 1

0

dt

1 − t

.

It is easy to show that for any word v ∈ X ∗ or w ∈ Y ∗, the expressions ζ∐∐ (v) and ζ∐∐- (w) are
polynomial with respect to θ.
It is no longer true that extended ζ∐∐- coincides with extended
ζ∐∐ ◦ s, but the defect can be explicitly written:

Theorem 1 (L. Boutet de Monvel, D. Zagier [28]). There exists an inﬁnite-order inversible
diﬀerential operator ρ : R[θ] → R[θ] such that

(11)

ζ∐∐ ◦ s = ρ ◦ ζ∐∐- .

The operator ρ is explicitly given by the series:

ρ = exp
Xn≥2

(−1)nζ(n)

n

dθ(cid:19)n
(cid:18) d
 .

ζ∐∐(cid:0)x1 ∐∐ s(w) − s(y1 ∐∐- w)(cid:1) = 0,

In particular, ρ(1) = 1, ρ(θ) = θ, and more generally ρ(P ) − P is a polynomial of degree ≤ d − 2 if
P is of degree d, hence ρ is inversible. A proof of Theorem 1 can be read in numerous references,
e.g. [6, 21, 24]. Any word w ∈ Y ∗

conv gives rise to Hoﬀman’s regularization relation:

which is a direct consequence of Theorem 1. The linear combination of words involved above is
convergent, hence (13) is a relation between convergent multiple zeta values, although divergent
ones have been used to establish it. The simplest regularization relation (5) is nothing but (13)
applied to the word w = y2.

Rooted trees can enrich the picture in two ways: ﬁrst of all, considering a rooted tree t with set
of vertices V(t) and decoration nv ∈ Z>0, v ∈ V(t), we deﬁne the associated contracted arboriﬁed
multiple zeta value by:

(14)

ζ T-(t) := Xk∈Dt Yv∈V(t)

1
knv
v

,

where Dt is made of those maps v 7→ kv ∈ Z>0 such that kv < kw if and only if there is a path
from the root to w through v. The sum (14) is convergent as long as nv ≥ 2 if v is a leaf of t. The
deﬁnition is multiplicatively extended to rooted forests. A similar deﬁnition can be introduced
starting from the integral representation (2): considering a rooted tree τ with set of vertices V(τ )
and decoration ev ∈ {0, 1}, v ∈ V(τ ), we deﬁne the associated arboriﬁed multiple zeta value by:

(12)

(13)

(15)

ζ T (τ ) :=Zu∈∆τ Yv∈V(τ )

duv
fev

,

where ∆τ ⊂ [0, 1]|V(τ )| is made of those maps v 7→ uv ∈ [0, 1] such that uv ≤ uw if and only if there
is a path from the root to w through v. The integral (15) is convergent as long as ev = 1 if v is the
root of τ and ev = 0 if v is a leaf of τ . A multiplicative extension to two-coloured rooted forests

4

DOMINIQUE MANCHON

will also be considered. Arboriﬁed multiple zeta values, in this non-contracted form, appear in a
recent paper by S. Yamamoto [27].

Arboriﬁed and contracted arboriﬁed multiple zeta values are ﬁnite linear combinations of ordi-

nary ones. For example we have :

n1

n2

ζ T-(

n3

) = ζ(n1, n2, n3) + ζ(n2, n1, n3) + ζ(n1 + n2, n3)

and, choosing black for colour 0 and white for colour 1:

ζ T(cid:18) (cid:19) = 2ζ(3, 1) + ζ(2, 2),

ζ T (

) = 3ζ(4).

The terminology comes from J. Ecalle’s arboriﬁcation, a transformation which admits a ”sim-
ple” and a ”contracting” version [15, 16]. This transformation is best understood in terms of a
canonical surjective morphism from Butcher-Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra of rooted forests onto
a corresponding shuﬄe Hopf algebra (quasi-shuﬄe Hopf algebra for the contracting arboriﬁcation)
[17].

The paper is organized as follows: after a reminder on shuﬄe and quasi-shuﬄe Hopf algebras,
we describe the two versions of arboriﬁcation in some detail, and we describe a possible trans-
formation from contracted arboriﬁed to arboriﬁed multiple zeta values, which can be seen as an
arboriﬁed version of the map s from words in Y ∗ into words in X ∗. A more natural version of
this arboriﬁed s with respect to the tree structures is still to be found.

2. Shuffle and quasi-shuffle Hopf algebras

Let V be any commutative algebra on a base ﬁeld k of characteristic zero. The product on V
will be denoted by (a, b) 7→ [ab]. This algebra is not supposed to be unital: in particular any vector
space can be considered as a commutative algebra with trivial product (a, b) 7→ [ab] = 0. The

associated quasi-shuﬄe Hopf algebra is (cid:0)T (V ), ∐∐- , ∆(cid:1), where (cid:0)T (V ), ∆(cid:1) is the tensor coalgebra:

T (V ) =Mk≥0

V ⊗k.

The indecomposable elements of V ⊗k will be denoted by v1 · · · vk with vj ∈ V . The coproduct ∆
is the deconcatenation coproduct:

(16)

∆(v1 · · · vk) :=

kXr=0

v1 · · · vr ⊗ vr+1 · · · vk.

The quasi-shuﬄe product ∐∐-

is given for any v1, . . . vp+q by:

(17)

(v1 · · · vp) ∐∐- (vp+1 · · · vp+q) :=Xr≥0 Xσ∈Qsh(p,q;r)

vσ
1 · · · vσ

p+q−r

with vj ∈ Y , j ∈ {1, . . . , p + q}, and where vσ
is the internal product of the letters in the set
j
σ−1({j}), which contains one or two elements. Note that if the internal product vanishes, only
ordinary shuﬄes (i.e. quasi-shuﬄes of type r = 0) do contribute to the quasi-shuﬄe product,

ARBORIFIED MULTIPLE ZETA VALUES

which specializes to the shuﬄe product ∐∐ in this case. The tensor coalgebra endowed with
the quasi-shuﬄe product ∐∐-
is a Hopf algebra which, remarkably enough, does not depend on
the particular choice of the internal product [20]. An explicit Hopf algebra isomorphism exp

from (cid:0)T (V ), ∐∐- , ∆(cid:1) onto (cid:0)T (V ), ∐∐ , ∆(cid:1) is given in [20]. Although we won’t use it, let us recall

its expression:
the set of sequences
I = (i1, . . . , ir) of positive integers such that i1 + · · · + ir = k. For any u = v1 . . . vk ∈ T (V ) and
any composition I = (i1, . . . , ir) of r we set:

let P(k) be the set of compositions of the integer k, i.e.

Then:

I[u] := [v1 . . . vi1].[vi1+1 · · · vi1+i2] . . . [vi1+···+ir−1+1 . . . vk].

exp u = XI=(i1,...,ir)∈P(k)

1

i1! . . . ir!

I[u].

Moreover ([20], lemma 2.4), the inverse log of exp is given by :

log u = XI=(i1,...,ir)∈P(k)

(−1)k−r
i1 . . . ir

I[u].

For example for v1, v2, v3 ∈ V we have:

exp v1 = v1

exp(v1v2) = v1v2 +

log v1 = v1,

Going back to the notations of the introduction, QhY i is the quasi-shuﬄe Hopf algebra associated
to the algebra tk[t] of polynomials without constant terms, whereas QhXi is the shuﬄe Hopf
algebra associated with the two-dimensional vector space spanned by X.

3. The Butcher-Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra of decorated rooted trees

Let D be a set. A rooted tree is an oriented (non planar) graph with a ﬁnite number of vertices,
among which one is distinguished and called the root, such that any vertex admits exactly one
incoming edge, except the root which has no incoming edges. A D-decorated rooted tree is a
rooted tree t together with a map from its set of vertices V(t) into D. Here is the list of (non-
decorated) rooted trees up to ﬁve vertices:

A D-decorated rooted forest is a ﬁnite collection of D-decorated rooted trees, with possible repe-
titions. The empty set is the forest containing no trees, and is denoted by 1. For any d ∈ D, the
grafting operator Bd
+ takes any forest and changes it into a tree by grafting all components onto
a common root decorated by d, with the convention Bd

+(1) = d.

Let T D denote the set of nonempty rooted trees and let HD

BCK = k[T D] be the free commutative
unital algebra generated by elements of T D. We identify a product of trees with the forest
containing these trees. Therefore the vector space underlying HD
BCK is the linear span of rooted
forests. This algebra is a graded and connected Hopf algebra, called the Hopf algebra of D-
decorated rooted trees, with the following structure: the grading is given by the number of
vertices, and the coproduct on a rooted forest u is described as follows [18, 23]: the set V(u) of

6

DOMINIQUE MANCHON

vertices of a forest u is endowed with a partial order deﬁned by x ≤ y if and only if there is a
path from a root to y passing through x. Any subset W of V(u) deﬁnes a subforest u|W
of u in
an obvious manner, i.e. by keeping the edges of u which link two elements of W . The coproduct
is then deﬁned by:

(18)

∆(u) = XV ∐W =V(u)

W <V

u|V

⊗ u|W

.

Here the notation W < V means that y < x for any vertex x in V and any vertex y in W such
that x and y are comparable. Such a couple (V, W ) is also called an admissible cut, with crown
(or pruning) u|V

. We have for example:

and trunk u|W

The counit is ε(1) = 1 and ε(u) = 0 for any non-empty forest u. The coassociativity of the
coproduct is easily checked using the following formula for the iterated coproduct :

⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ + ⊗

⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ + 2 ⊗ + ⊗ .

∆(cid:0) (cid:1) =
∆(cid:0) (cid:1) =
e∆n−1(u) = XV1∐···∐Vn=V(u)

Vn<···<V1

u|V1

⊗ · · · ⊗ u|Vn

.

The notation Vn < · · · < V1 is to be understood as Vi < Vj for any i > j, with i, j ∈ {1, . . . , n}.

This Hopf algebra ﬁrst appeared in the work of A. D¨ur in 1986 [11]. It has been rediscovered and
intensively studied by D. Kreimer in 1998 [22], as the Hopf algebra describing the combinatorial
part of the BPHZ renormalization procedure of Feynman graphs in a scalar ϕ3 quantum ﬁeld
theory. Its group of characters:

(19)

GD

BCK = Homalg(HD

BCK, k)

is known as the Butcher group and plays a key role in approximation methods in numerical
analysis [5]. A. Connes and D. Kreimer also proved in [9] that the operators Bd
+ satisfy the
property

∆(cid:0)Bd

+(t1 · · · tn)(cid:1) = Bd

for any t1, ..., tn ∈ T . This means that Bd
with values in HD

BCK.

+(t1 · · · tn) ⊗ 1 + (Id ⊗Bd

+) ◦ ∆(t1 · · · tn),

+ is a 1-cocycle in the Hochschild cohomology of HD

BCK

4. Simple and contracting arborification

The Hopf algebra of decorated rooted forests enjoys the following universal property (see e.g.
[18]): let D be a set, let H be a graded Hopf algebra, and, for any d ∈ D, let Ld : H → H be a
Hochschild one-cocycle, i.e. a linear map such that:

∆(cid:0)Ld(x)(cid:1) = Ld(x) ⊗ 1H + (Id ⊗Ld) ◦ ∆(x).

BCK → H such that:

Then there exists a unique Hopf algebra morphism Φ : HD
+ = Ld ◦ ΦL

ΦL ◦ Bd

(22)

for any d ∈ D. Now let V be a commutative algebra, let (cid:0)T (V ), ∐∐- , ∆(cid:1) be the corresponding

quasi-shuﬄe Hopf algebra, let (ed)d∈D be a linear basis of V , and let Ld : T (V ) → T (V ) the right
concatenation by ed, deﬁned by:

(23)

Ld(v1 . . . vk) := v1 . . . vked.

(20)

(21)

ARBORIFIED MULTIPLE ZETA VALUES

7

One can easily check, due to the particular form of the deconcatenation coproduct, that Ld veriﬁes
the one-cocycle condition (21). The contracting arboriﬁcation of the quasi-shuﬄe Hopf algebra
above is the unique Hopf algebra morphism

(24)

aV : HD

BCK →→(cid:0)T (V ), ∐∐- , ∆(cid:1)

such that aV ◦Bd
+ = Ld ◦ aV for any d ∈ D. It is obviously surjective, since the word w = ed1 · · · edr
can be obtained as the image of the ladder ℓY (w) with r vertices decorated by d1, . . . dr from top
to bottom. This map is invariant under linear base changes. For the shuﬄe algebra (i.e. when
the internal product on V is set to zero), the corresponding Hopf algebra morphism aV is called
simple arboriﬁcation, and the corresponding section will be denoted by ℓX.

Let us apply this construction to multiple zeta values (the base ﬁeld k being the ﬁeld Q of
rational numbers): we denote by aX (resp. aY ) the simple (resp. contracting) arboriﬁcation
from HX
BCK onto QhY i). The maps ζ∐∐ and ζ∐∐- deﬁned in the
introduction are characters of the (Hopf) algebras QhXi and QhY i respectively, with values in
the algebra R[θ]. The simple and contracted arboriﬁed multiple zeta values are then respectively
given by:

BCK onto QhXi (resp.

An obvious answer to this problem is given by:

where ℓX is the section of aX described in the previous section. It has the drawback of completely
destroying the geometry of trees: indeed, any Y -decorated forest is mapped on a linear combina-
tion of X-decorated ladders. We are then looking for a more natural map with respect to the tree
