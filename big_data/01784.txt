OF AFFINE QUIVERS

XUEQING CHEN, MING DING AND FAN XU

Abstract. It has been proved in [19] that cluster variables in cluster algebras
of every skew-symmetric cluster algebra are positive. We prove that any reg-
ular generalized cluster variable of an aﬃne quiver is positive. As a corollary,
we obtain that generalized cluster variables of aﬃne quivers are positive and
construct various positive bases. This generalizes the results in [12] and [8].

1. Introduction

Cluster algebras were introduced by S. Fomin and A. Zelevinsky [14] in or-
der to develop a combinatorial approach to study problems of total positivity and
canonical bases in quantum groups. A cluster algebra A is a subring of the ﬁeld
Q(x1, · · · , xn) of rational fractions in n indeterminates, and deﬁned via a set of
generators constructed recursively. These generators are called cluster variables
and are grouped into subsets of ﬁxed ﬁnite cardinality called clusters. Monomials
in the variables belonging to the same cluster are called cluster monomials. By the

Laurent phenomenon [14], it is well-known that A ⊂ Tc Z[c±1] where c runs over
the clusters in A. An element x ∈ A is called positive if x ∈ Tc N[c±1] where c runs

over the clusters in A. It is conjectured that cluster variables are always positive
[14]. It has been proved in [19] that the positivity conjecture holds for the class of
skew-symmetric cluster algebras.

Various Z−bases were constructed in the cluster algebras A(Q) [24, 4, 16, 10,
8, 15]. When Q is an aﬃne quiver, these bases can be expressed as a disjoint
union of the set of cluster monomials and a set of generalized cluster variables
XM associated to some non-rigid regular kQ−modules M . Hence, studying the
positivity for regular generalized cluster variables is helpful for us to construct
canonical bases of cluster algebras.

for any cluster c which is compatible with R (see Deﬁnition 2.1).

For types eA and eD, G. Dupont has proved [12, Corollary 5.5] that if M is an in-
decomposable regular module in an exceptional tube R, then XM ∈ A(Q)T N[c±1]
In this paper, we focus on cluster algebras of aﬃne quivers, that is of type eA, eD
or eE and prove that the coeﬃcients of Laurent expansions in normalized Chebyshev

polynomials of the generalized cluster variable associated to quasi-simple modules
in homogeneous tubes are positive integer (Proposition 3.2). As an application,
we deduce the positivity in regular generalized cluster variables (Theorem 3.3) and

obtain various positive integral bases in cluster algebras of aﬃne quivers (Corollary
3.4).

2. preliminary

Let Q be an acyclic quiver with vertex set Q0 = {1, 2, · · · , n} and we denote
by A(Q) the associated cluster algebra. Let C be the complex number ﬁeld and
A = CQ be the path algebra of Q and we denote by Pi(resp. Ii) the indecom-
posable projective(resp. injective) CQ-module with the simple top(resp. socle) Si
corresponding to i ∈ Q0. A connected component in the Auslander-Reiten quiver
of CQ−modules is called regular if it doesn’t contain any projective or injective
CQ−module. A CQ−module is called regular if all of its indecomposable direct
summands belong to regular components. Every regular component is of the form
ZA∞/(p) for p ≥ 0. If p ≥ 1, the regular component is called a tube of rank p. If
p > 1, the regular component is called an exceptional tube. If p = 1, the regular
component is called a homogeneous tube. If p = 0, the regular component is called
a sheet.

Let Db(Q) be the bounded derived category of modCQ with the shift functor
T and the AR-translation τ . The cluster category associated to Q was introduced
in [1] in the spirit of categoriﬁcation of cluster algebras. It is the orbit category
C(Q) := Db(Q)/F with F = [1] ◦ τ −1. Let Q(x1, · · · , xn) be a transcendental
extension of Q. The Caldero-Chapton map of an acyclic quiver Q is the map

X Q

? : obj(C(Q)) → Q(x1, · · · , xn)

deﬁned in [2] by the following rules:

(1) if M is an indecomposable CQ-module, then

M = X

(2) if M = Pi[1] is the shift of the projective module associated to i ∈ Q0, then

X Q

M = xi;

(3) for any two objects M, N of CQ, we have
M X Q
N .

M⊕N = X Q

X Q

Here, we denote by h−, −i the Euler form on CQ-modules and Gre(M ) is the e-
Grassmannian of M, i.e. the variety of submodules of M with dimension vector e.
χ(Gre(M )) denote its Euler-Poincar´e characteristic. We note that the indecompos-
able CQ-modules and Pi[1] for i ∈ Q0 exhaust the indecomposable objects of the
cluster category C(Q). For any object M ∈ C(Q), X Q
M will be called the generalized
cluster variable for M . If M is a regular CQ-module, X Q
M will be called the regular
generalized cluster variable. In [22], the author generalized the Caldero-Chapoton
map for any cluster-tilting object T which is called the cluster character associated
to T .

We recall that the normalized Chebyshev polynomial of the ﬁrst kind is deﬁned

by:

F0(x) = 2, F1(x) = x,

Fn(x) = xFn−1(x) − Fn−2(x) f or any n ≥ 2.

It is known that Fn is characterized by

Fn(t + t−1) = tn + t−n

Following the terminology of [8, 10], we denote the generalized cluster variables
associated to indecomposable regular modules with quasi-length n in homogeneous
tubes for aﬃne type by Xnδ.

Deﬁnition 2.1. [12] (1) A cluster-tilting object T and a regular component R are
called to be compatible if R does not contain any indecomposable direct summand
of T as a quasi-simple module.

(2) Let T be any cluster-tilting object in C(Q). Set FT = HomC(Q)(T, −), B =
EndC(Q)(T ) and cT = {ci|i ∈ Q0}. For any object M in C(Q) which is not in
add(T [1]) and for any e ∈ K0(mod − B), the e−component of X T

M is

The following result which was proved in [12] will be useful for us to prove the

positivity.

Theorem 2.2. [12] Let Q be a quiver of aﬃne types with at least three vertices. Let
T be a cluster-tilting object such that there exists an exceptional tube T compatible
M ) ∈ N[c±1
with T . Assume that int(X T
T ] for any quasi-simple module M in T .
Then, for any n ≥ 1, the following holds:

Fn(Xδ) ∈ A(Q) ∩ N[c±1
T ].

In [5], the authors has solved the positivity conjecture for all cluster variables of
all skew-symmetric quantum cluster algebras. In particular, we have the following
result.

Theorem 2.3. [5] Let Q be a quiver of aﬃne types. Let T be any cluster-tilting
object in C(Q) and M be an indecomposable rigid object not in add(T [1]). Then,
for any e ∈ K0(mod − B), we have

χ(Gre(FT M )) ≥ 0.

According to Theorem 2.2 and Theorem 2.3, we can deduce the following corol-

lary which are proved in [12] for types eA and eD:

Corollary 2.4. Let Q be a quiver of aﬃne types with at least three vertices. Let
T be a cluster-tilting object such that there exists an exceptional tube T compatible
with T . Then, for any n ≥ 1, the following holds:

Fn(Xδ) ∈ A(Q) ∩ N[c±1
T ].

3. positivity for regular generalized cluster variables of affine

quivers

In this section, we will prove the positivity for regular generalized cluster vari-

ables of aﬃne quivers.

XUEQING CHEN, MING DING AND FAN XU

Lemma 3.1. Let Q be a quiver of aﬃne types and T be a cluster-tilting object of
C(Q) such that each exceptional regular component R contains at least an indecom-
posable direct summand of T . Then there exists some i such that Ti is not a regular
module and satisﬁes that dimC Ext1
C(Q)(Ti, M (δ)) = 1, where M (δ) is a regular
module with dimension vector δ in any homogeneous tube.

Proof. It is known that the shift functor [1] = τ induces an equivalence of cluster
categories and maps cluster-tilting object to another cluster-tilting object. For

types eA, such Ti is always exists because of δ = (1, · · · , 1). Now we consider the
types eD and eE. In these cases, we can also ﬁnd such Ti, since then the cluster-tilting

object T contains at least an indecomposable direct summand in the exceptional
regular component of rank 2.
(cid:3)

For any object M L ⊕iPi[1] in the cluster category C(Q) where M is a CQ−module

and Pi is a projective CQ−module associated to the vertex i, recall that the di-
mension vector is deﬁned by

dim(M M ⊕iPi[1]) = dimM − ΣidimSi,

where Si is a simple CQ−module associated to the vertex i. We are now ready to
prove the following result.

Proposition 3.2. Let Q be a quiver of aﬃne types, then

Fn(Xδ) ∈ A(Q) ∩ N[c±1]

for any cluster c.

Proof. When Q is a Kronecker quiver, it has been proved in [24]. In the following,
we always assume that the aﬃne quiver Q with at least three vertices.

i=1 Ti be any cluster-tilting object in C(Q), we only need to prove

Let T = Ln

that Fn(Xδ) ∈ A(Q) ∩ N[X ±1
T1

, · · · , X ±1
Tn ].

According to Corollary 2.4, we only need to prove it for such cluster-tilting
object T satisfying that each exceptional regular component R contains at least
an indecomposable direct summand of T . By Lemma 3.1, there exists some i such
that Ti is not a regular module and satisﬁes that dim Ext1
C(Q)(Ti, M (δ)) = 1. Then
by the one dimension cluster multiplication formulas in [3], we get

XδXTi = XE + XE ′.

Remark that E and E′ are both indecomposable rigid objects but not regular
CQ−modules. For convenience, we denote the rigid object in C(Q) whose dimension
vector e by M (e). Thus we have M (dimTi) = Ti, as they are both rigid objects
with the same dimension vectors.

We now prove the following claim by induction:

Fn(Xδ)XTi = XM(dimTi+nδ) + XM(dimTi−nδ)

for dimTi > nδ;

Fn(Xδ)XTi = XM(dimTi+nδ) + XM(nδ−dimTi)[−1]

for dimTi < nδ.

Firstly suppose that n = 1, by the above discussions, we have

XδXTi = XM(dimTi+δ) + XM(dimTi−δ)

for dimTi > δ;

XδXTi = XM(dimTi+δ) + XM(δ−dimTi)[−1]

for dimTi < δ.

Secondly suppose that n = 2, which need to be divided into the following two

cases:

ON POSITIVITY FOR GENERALIZED CLUSTER VARIABLES OF AFFINE QUIVERS

(1) If dimTi > δ, we have

F2(Xδ)XTi = (X 2

δ − 2)XTi

= Xδ(XM(dimTi+δ) + XM(dimTi−δ)) − 2XTi
= XM(dimTi+2δ) + XTi + XδXM(dimTi−δ) − 2XTi.

We compute XδXM(dimTi−δ), which can be solved in the following cases:
In the case that dimTi > 2δ, we have

XδXM(dimTi−δ) = XTi + XM(dimTi−2δ),

thus

F2(Xδ)XTi = XM(dimTi+2δ) + XM(dimTi−2δ);

In the case that dimTi < 2δ, we have

XδXM(dimTi−δ) = XTi + XM(2δ−dimTi)[−1],

thus

F2(Xδ)XTi = XM(dimTi+2δ) + XM(2δ−dimTi)[−1].

(2) If dimTi < δ, we have

F2(Xδ)XTi = (X 2

δ − 2)XTi

= Xδ(XM(dimTi+δ) + XM(δ−dimTi)[−1]) − 2XTi
= XM(dimTi+2δ) + XTi + XM(2δ−dimTi)[−1] + XTi − 2XTi
= XM(dimTi+2δ) + XM(2δ−dimTi)[−1].

Now suppose that the above equations hold for all k ≤ n, we need to prove them

for k = n + 1, which can be divided into the following two cases:

(1) If dimTi > nδ, we have

Fn+1(Xδ)XTi = (XδFn(Xδ) − Fn−1(Xδ))XTi

= Xδ(XM(dimTi+nδ) + XM(dimTi−nδ))
− (XM(dimTi+(n−1)δ) + XM(dimTi−(n−1)δ))
= XM(dimTi+(n+1)δ) + XM(dimTi+(n−1)δ) + XδXM(dimTi−nδ)
− (XM(dimTi+(n−1)δ) + XM(dimTi−(n−1)δ)).

We need to compute XδXM(dimTi−nδ) :
In the case that dimTi > (n + 1)δ, we have

XδXM(dimTi−nδ) = XM(dimTi−(n−1)δ) + XM(dimTi−(n+1)δ),

Thus we have

Fn+1(Xδ)XTi = XM(dimTi+(n+1)δ) + XM(dimTi−(n+1)δ);

In the case that dimTi < (n + 1)δ, we have

XδXM(dimTi−nδ) = XM(dimTi−(n−1)δ) + XM((n+1)δ−dimTi)[−1],

thus

Fn+1(Xδ)XTi = XM(dimTi+(n+1)δ) + XM((n+1)δ−dimTi)[−1].

(2) If dimTi < nδ, we have

6

XUEQING CHEN, MING DING AND FAN XU

Fn+1(Xδ)XTi = (XδFn(Xδ) − Fn−1(Xδ))XTi

= Xδ(XM(dimTi+nδ) + XM(nδ−dimTi)[−1]) − Fn−1(Xδ)XTi
= XM(dimTi+(n+1)δ) + XM(dimTi+(n−1)δ)
+ XδXM(nδ−dimTi)[−1] − Fn−1(Xδ)XTi .

When dimTi > (n − 1)δ, we have

XδXM(nδ−dimTi)[−1] = XM((n+1)δ−dimTi)[−1] + XM(dimTi−(n−1)δ),

and

then we have

Fn−1(Xδ)XTi = XM(dimTi+(n−1)δ) + XM(dimTi−(n−1)δ),

Fn+1(Xδ)XTi = XM(dimTi+(n+1)δ) + XM((n+1)δ−dimTi)[−1];

When dimTi < (n − 1)δ, we obtain

XδXM(nδ−dimTi)[−1] = XM((n+1)δ−dimTi)[−1] + XM((n−1)δ−dimTi)[−1],

and

Fn−1(Xδ)XTi = XM(dimTi+(n−1)δ) + XM((n−1)δ−dimTi)[−1],

thus we have

Fn+1(Xδ)XTi = XM(dimTi+(n+1)δ) + XM((n+1)δ−dimTi)[−1].

The claim is proved.

Note that XM(dimTi+nδ), XM(dimTi−nδ) and XM(nδ−dimTi)[−1] are all cluster vari-
Tn ]. Thus, by the above

ables, then by [19], they belong to A(Q) ∩ N[X ±1
T1
proved claim, we obtain

, · · · , X ±1

Fn(Xδ) ∈ A(Q) ∩ N[X ±1
T1

, · · · , X ±1
Tn ].

Therefore the result follows.

(cid:3)

Now we make use of Proposition 3.2 to prove the main result in this paper.

Theorem 3.3. Let Q be a quiver of aﬃne types, then

XM ∈ A(Q) ∩ N[c±1]

for any object M in C(Q) and any cluster c.

Proof. For any object M, N ∈ C(Q), we have XM⊕N = XM XN , and also it is well-
known that cluster variables are positive, so we only need to prove the theorem for
any indecomposable regular generalized variables.

Firstly, we consider the case in homogenerous tubes. Note that Xnδ = Fn(Xδ) +

X(n−2)δ, thus we can prove Xnδ ∈ N[c±1] by induction.

Secondly, we consider the case in non-homogenerous tubes. We ﬁx a non-
homogenerous tube T of rank r. The quasi-simples of T are denoted by Ei with
1 ≤ i ≤ r ordered so that τ Ei = Ei−1. The regular module with quasi-socle E
and quasi-length k for any k ∈ N are denoted by E[k]. According to the general
diﬀerent property (see [11, Theorem 3.4]):

XEi[nr+k] = XEi[k]Fn(Xδ) + XEi+k+1[nr−k−2]

where r is the rank of an exceptional tube, n ≥ 0 and 0 ≤ k ≤ r − 1, and the
positivity of Fn(Xδ) which is proved in Proposition 3.2, we can deduce XEi[nr+k] ∈

ON POSITIVITY FOR GENERALIZED CLUSTER VARIABLES OF AFFINE QUIVERS

A(Q)∩N[c±1] by induction. Here we only need to note that XδXEi[r−1] = XEi[2r−1]
where 0 ≤ i ≤ r − 1.
(cid:3)

Let Q be a quiver of aﬃne types, then we have the following three integral bases

of the cluster algebras A(Q) (see [8, 10, 11]):

B = CM ∪ {Fn(Xδ)XR|R is a regular rigid kQ-module and n ≥ 1}

S = CM ∪ {XnδXR|R is a regular rigid kQ-module and n ≥ 1}
G = CM ∪ {X n

δ XR|R is a regular rigid kQ-module and n ≥ 1}

where we denote the set of all cluster monomials of the cluster algebras A(Q) by
CM.

We can now put all these results together to obtain:

Corollary 3.4. Let Q be a quiver of aﬃne types and c be any cluster, then we have

(1) B ∈ A(Q) ∩ N[c±1];
(2) S ∈ A(Q) ∩ N[c±1];
(3) G ∈ A(Q) ∩ N[c±1];

Proof. By Proposition 3.2 and the positivity in cluster variables, we obtain that

B ∈ A(Q) ∩ N[c±1].

By Theorem 3.3 and the positivity in cluster variables, we obtain that

S ∈ A(Q) ∩ N[c±1] and G ∈ A(Q) ∩ N[c±1].

The result follows.

(cid:3)

Remark 3.5. (1) The basis B was initially constructed for rank 2 cluster algebras
in [15] where are called canonical

of ﬁnite and aﬃne types in [24] and for type eA(1)
bases, and then constructed for types A and eA in [13] where are called the atomic

basis.

(2) The basis B was constructed for the Kronecker quiver [4] where is called the

dual semicanonical basis.

(3) The basis G was constructed in [10] for type eA and [8] for aﬃne types, and

for more general case in [17] where are called the generic basis.

4. An example: type eD4
We consider the tame quiver Q of type eD4 as follows

In this case, we will provide an explicit description of the proof in Proposition 3.2.
The category of regular modules decomposes into a direct sum of tubes indexed
by the projective line P1 among which there are just three tubes of rank 2 and
all other tubes are homogeneous tubes [6]. We denote these three exceptional

tubes labelled by the subset {0, 1, ∞} of P1. The quasi-simple modules in non-
homogeneous tubes are denoted by E1, E2, E3, E4, E5, E6, where

dim(E1) = (1, 1, 1, 0, 0), dim(E2) = (1, 0, 0, 1, 1), dim(E3) = (1, 1, 0, 1, 0),

dim(E4) = (1, 0, 1, 0, 1), dim(E5) = (1, 0, 1, 1, 0), dim(E6) = (1, 1, 0, 0, 1).

We remark that {E1, E2}, {E3, E4} and {E5, E6} are pairs of the quasi-simple
modules at the mouth of exceptional tubes labelled by 1, ∞ and 0, respectively.
We denote the minimal imaginary root by δ = (2, 1, 1, 1, 1). From the Auslander-

Reiten quiver of type eD4, we know that all preprojective modules are the following

forms:

1): C(n) with dimC(n) = (2n − 1, n − 1, n − 1, n − 1, n − 1), where n ≥ 1.

The following result proved in [7] is useful for us to get the positivity.

Proposition 4.1. [7] Assume that n ≥ 1, then we have

(1) If n = 1, then

XδXP2 = XM1(3) + XM ′

1(1);

(2) If n ≥ 3 is odd, then

XδXM1(n) = XM1(n+2) + XM1(n−2).

Similar to Proposition 4.1(2), it is easy to show the following result directly.

Proposition 4.2. If n ≥ 3 is odd, then

XδXM ′

1(n) = XM ′

1(n+2) + XM ′

1(n−2).

For any cluster-tilting object T , it is easy to see that there exists at least a
direct summand Ti of T such that τ mTi is equal to some Pk for 2 ≤ k ≤ 5 and some
certain m ∈ Z. Note that τ induces an equivalence of cluster categories and maps
cluster-tilting object to another cluster-tilting object. Without loss of generality,
we can assume that Ti = P2, then we have the following result.

Proposition 4.3. Assume that n ≥ 1, then we have

Fn(Xδ)XP2 = XM1(2n+1) + XM ′

1(2n−1).

Proof. We prove it by induction. When n = 1, it follows from the Proposition
4.1(1). When n = 2, note that P2 = M1(1), we have

F2(Xδ)XP2 = (X 2

δ − 2)XP2

= Xδ(XM1(3) + XM ′
= XM1(5) + XM1(1) + XM ′
= XM1(5) + XM ′

1(3).

1(1)) − 2XP2

1(3) + XM1(1) − 2XP2

Now suppose that it holds for n ≤ k. When n = k + 1, then by Proposition 4.1 and
Proposition 4.2, we have

Fk+1(Xδ)XP2 = (XδFk(Xδ) − Fk−1(Xδ))XP2

= Xδ(XM1(2k+1) + XM ′
= XM1(2k+3) + XM1(2k−1) + XM ′
− (XM1(2k−1) + XM ′
= XM1(2k+3) + XM ′

1(2k−3))
1(2k+1).

1(2k−1)) − (XM1(2k−1) + XM ′

1(2k−3))

1(2k+1) + XM ′

1(2k−3)

Thus the proof is ﬁnished.

(cid:3)

It is obvious to see that XM1(2n+1) and XM ′
, · · · , X ±1

both of them belong to A(Q) ∩ N[X ±1
T1
Proposition 4.3, we get

1(2n−1) are all cluster variables, so
Tn ]. Note that XP2 = XTi , then by

Fn(Xδ) ∈ A(Q) ∩ N[X ±1
T1

, · · · , X ±1
Tn ].
