Multi-band Variability Analysis of Mrk 421

H. Z. Li1, Y. G. Jiang2,†, D. F. Guo2, X. Chen2, T. F. Yi3

ABSTRACT

We have assembled the historical variability data of Mrk 421 at radio 15 GHz,
X-ray and γ-ray bands, spanning about 6.3, 10.3 and 7.5 yr, respectively. We ana-
lyzed the variability by using three methods. The results indicated that there is a
period of 287.6 ± 4.4 days for 15 GHz, 309.5 ± 5.8 days for X-ray and 283.4 ± 4.7
days for γ-ray, respectively. This period can be reasonably explained by the
nonballistic helical motion of the emitting material. The correlation analysis
suggested that the variabilities of radio 15 GHz, X-ray and γ-ray are remark-
able correlated, and the emission of radio 15 GHz lags behind that of X-ray, and
the X-ray ﬂux lags behind the γ-ray. This suggests that the γ-ray derives from
inverse Compton (IC) scattering of the synchrotron photons, supporting the syn-
chrotron self-Compton (SSC) model. Moreover, the time delay between diﬀerent
wavebands could be explained by the shock-in-jet models, in which a moving
emission region produces the radio to γ-ray activity, implying that the emission
region of γ-ray is closer to the center than ones of X-ray and radio emission.

Introduction

Blazars are a subclass of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with strong variabilities. The
variability analysis is the most powerful tool to probe the emission mechanism and processes
(Chandra et al. 2014; Sillanp¨a¨a et al. 1988; Lainela et al. 1999). Based on the variability

timescales, the variabilities can be roughly divided into three classes: the intra-day vari-
ability (IDV) with the timescale from several minutes to a day, the short term variability
(STV) with the timescale from several days to several months, and the long term variability
(LTV) on the timescale of years (Gupta et al. 2008; Gaur et al. 2012). Blazar variabilities
have been well studied by many authors (e.g. Chen et al. 2014; Li et al. 2006, 2009, 2010,
2015; Poon et al. 2009; Qian et al. 2007; Raiteri et al. 2003; Sillanp¨a¨a et al. 1988; Xie et al.
2008; Zhang et al. 2008).

Mrk 421 (B2 1101+384) is the ﬁrst extragalactic source detected at TeV energy, and
is one of the nearest and brightest BL Lac object with a redshift z = 0.031 (Lico et al.
2012; Punch et al. 1992). It is classiﬁed as the high energy peaked BL Lac object (HBL),
because the synchrotron hump peaks at soft X-rays. In the optical band, strong variability
was observed for this object (Gaur et al. 2012; Liu et al. 1997; Miller 1975). Xie et al. (1988)
discovered that the optical brightness changed 1.4 mag in 2.5 hr. Stein et al. (1976) found
a LTV with 4.6 mag. In X-ray and γ-ray bands, the source is almost always active with
a big eruption on a timescale about two years (Bartoli et al. 2011; Cui 2004; Gaur et al.
2012; Tluczykont et al. 2010). Moreover, a major outburst always accompanies with many
quick ﬂares (Bartoli et al. 2011). In the spring-summer 2006, Tramacere et al. (2009) found
that the X-ray ﬂux of Mrk 421 reached its highest record. In 2006 April, Mrk 421
underwent a large ﬂare and the X-ray ﬂux was variable (Ushio et al. 2009). In
2010 January and February, big X-ray outbursts were observed from the object (Isobe et al.
2010). X-ray and TeV outbursts were also reported for the source by Kerrick et al. (1995)
and Takahashi et al. (1994, 1995) in 1994 and 1995, respectively.

Diﬀerent timescale variabilities of Mrk 421 have been intensively investigated (Blasi et al.

2013). A radio ﬂare at 43 GHz during 2011 on a timescale about △t ∼ 150 days was re-
ported in the VLBI core by Blasi et al. (2013). Racero & de la Calle (2013) studied the
multiwavelength data of Mrk 421, and the results suggest that the radio emission is consis-
tent with γ-ray on timescales from 1 day to 6 months. For infrared emission, IDV and STV
were found by Gupta et al. (2004) for the source. Variability on timescales from 32 to 256
days in X-ray and TeV bands was discovered by Smith et al. (2008). By using the structure
function, Horan et al. (2009) found that the variability timescales are △t ∼ 5 and 8 days for
the Proportional Counter Array (PCA) data, △t ∼ 20 and 25 days for the All Sky Monitor
(ASM) data, △t ∼ 55 and 71 days for the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) data, and △t ∼ 40
and 60 days for the optical data. Bartoli et al. (2011) reported that Mrk 421 would undergo
a major outburst about once every two years in X-ray and γ-ray bands, and the outburst
usually lasts several months. By using the Jurkevich method, Liu et al. (1997) found that
there are two possible periods with timescales of 23.1 ±1.1 and 15.3 ±0.7 years in the B band
of Mrk 421. Chen et al. (2014) investigated the B and V bands historical variability data,

– 3 –

and a possible period of about 1.36 years was found. These previous results suggest that
various quasi-periodic timescales exist in the variability of Mrk 421 at multiple wavebands.

The correlations among diﬀerent wavelengths of Mrk 421 have been intensively stud-
ied. The correlation analysis of X-ray and γ-ray variability suggests that there is a signiﬁcant
correlation between them (Balokovi´c et al. 2013; Acciari et al. 2014, 2011; Abdo et al. 2014;
Fossati et al. 2008; Horan et al. 2009; Smith et al. 2008; Ushio et al. 2010; Bartoli et al.
2011; Bla`zejowski et al. 2005). Gaur et al. (2012) investigated the correlation between the
optical and X-ray bands, and found that the optical variability lags behind the X-ray vari-
ability for 9.5±2 days. Max-Moerbeck et al. (2014) investigated the relationship between the
radio and γ-ray emission of Mrk 421, and found that the γ-ray variability is well correlated
with radio variability lagging for 40 ± 9 days. Richards et al. (2013) found that the 15
GHz and LAT γ-ray light curves are well correlated around the 2012 ﬂares, with
15 GHz lagging 40 days behind. Moreover, Lico et al. (2014) suggested that the radio
and γ-ray light curves of Mrk 421 are correlated with zero delay.

Obviously, Mrk 421 is a very active and highly variable source with variable timescales.
In this work, we extracted the radio 15 GHz, X-ray and γ-ray light curves from the published
database. Both the variability and the correlations among diﬀerent wavelengths are analyzed
in detail. This paper is arranged as follows: the data assembling is described in Sect. 2; the
periodic analysis methods and the results are given in Sect. 3; the correlation analysis is
given in Sect. 4; in the last section, we give discussion and conclusions.

2. Observation Data and Variability Analysis of the Light Curves

We presented the variability data of Mrk 421 at radio 15 GHz, X-ray (0.3-10 keV) and
γ-ray (0.1-300 GeV). The 15 GHz data of Mrk 421 were taken from the 40 m Telescope
at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO)1. The objects measured by OVRO at 15
GHz are same as ones observed by Fermi γ-ray, which can promote the understanding of the
emission mechanisms of blazars. The light curve of 15 GHz spans about 6.3 yr from January
7th, 2008 to May 14th, 2014.

The data of X-ray (0.3-10 keV) were obtained from the database of the X-ray Telescope
(XRT) in Swift, and were processed using the web-based tool2 (Evans et al. 2009). Using this
software, the light curves of Mrk 421 were obtained using the observation bin and 3-σ upper

limits. The overall light curves contain all Swift-XRT observations in Photon Counting (PC)
and Windowed Timing (WT) modes (Burrows et al. 2005; Evans et al. 2009) from February
28th, 2005 to June 24th, 2015.

The γ-ray data (0.1 − 300 GeV) are measured by Fermi LAT (The Large Area Telescope
on the Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope spacecraft), and the weekly variability data are
taken from the Fermi light curves3. The γ-ray data used in this paper were observed during
August 2th, 2008 to August 18th 2015.

The light curves are displayed in Figure 1. Figure 1 shows that Mrk 421 is a highly active
source, with a variability index V15GHz = 0.50, VX = 0.98 and Vγ = 0.87. The variability
index is deﬁned by the formula (Fan et al. 2002; Li et al. 2009)

V =

Fmax − Fmin
Fmax + Fmin

,

(1)

where Fmax and Fmin is the maximal and minimal ﬂux, respectively.

3. Analysis Method and Periodicity Results

3.1. The results of the Lomb-Scargle periodogram

The Lomb-Scargle periodogram (Lomb 1976; Scargle 1982) is a traditional method,
and can be applied to analyze the periodicity in the nonequispaced variability data. The
periodogram is a function of circular frequency ω, and is deﬁned by the formula

PX(ω) ≡

1
2

{

[ΣiX(ti)cosω(ti − τ )]2

Σicos2ω(ti − τ )

+

[ΣiX(ti)sinω(ti − τ )]2

Σisin2ω(ti − τ )

},

where X(ti) (i = 0, 1..., N0) is a time series. τ is calculated by the equation

τ =

1
2ω

tan−1[

Σisin2ωti
Σicos2ωti

],

(2)

(3)

where ω = 2πν. Thus, the periodogram is a function of frequency ν. For a true signal
X(ti), the power in PX(ω) would present a peak, or the power of a purely noise signal would
be a exponential distribution. For a power level z, the False Alarm Probability (FAP) is
calculated by (Scargle 1982; Press et al. 1994)

p(> z) ≈ N · exp(−z),

(4)

3http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/access/lat/msl lc/

– 5 –

where N is the number of data point (Press et al. 1994).

The result of the Lomb-Scargle periodogram is shown in Figure 2. The (a), (b) and (c)
panel of Figure 2 give the results of 15 GHz, X-ray and γ-ray, respectively. The (a) panel
shows that possible periods are 181.9, 206.1, 237.8 and 289.9 days in the light curves of 15
GHz. The FAP of the results is computed using the equation 4, and the red line in the (a)
panel of Figure 2 denotes the FAP levels of 0.01. The (a) panel suggests that the FAP
levels of the four possible timescales are smaller than 0.01 (FAP< 0.01), which means that
the conﬁdence levels of all the timescale are larger than 99%. The (b) and (c) panel of Figure
2 implies that the possible periods are 311.7 and 281.1 days in the X-ray and γ-ray light
curves, respectively. The (b) and (c) panel also displays that the FAP levels of all timescales
are smaller than 0.01. The results of the X-ray and γ-ray are consistent with the period of
289.9 days in the 15 GHz light curve.

In order to test the reliability and the signiﬁcance level of the possible detected peak
signals in the power spectra, we also estimated the red noise signiﬁcance level using the RED-
FIT38 software4 (Schulz & Mudelsee 2002), which ﬁts a ﬁrst-order autoregressive process
to the time series to estimate the red-noise spectrum. The top, middle and bottom panel of
Figure 3 give 15 GHz, X-ray and γ-ray results calculated by REDFIT38 software. Figure 3
shows that the variability timescales f = 0.003443 (P = 290.4 days) with signiﬁcance level
p > 80% for 15 GHz, f = 0.003318 (P = 301.4 days) with signiﬁcance level p > 99% for
X-ray, and f = 0.003489 (P = 286.6 days) with signiﬁcance level p > 99% for γ-ray.

3.2. The Jurkevich method and results

Based on the standard deviation, the Jurkevich method (Jurkevich 1971) is a very
useful technology to seek the variability signal from the nonequispaced variability data. This
method tests a range of possible signals. According to a possible signal, the data are folded
and split into m terms. For the lth term of a data series xi, the parameters xl = 1
i=1 xi
ml
and V 2
l are calculated. Then, the sum of the squared deviations of m
terms V 2
is also calculated. If the possible signal tested is a genuine one, the
value of V 2

m would attain its minimum value (Jurkevich 1971).

The (a), (b) and (c) panel of Figure 4 give the results of 15 GHz, X-ray and γ-ray light
curves of Figure 1 from the Jurkevich method, respectively. The (a) panel of Figure 4 shows
that there is a clear least value of V 2
m plot at the timescale of 289 ± 11.5 days, indicating

4http://www.geo.uni-bremen.de/geomod/staﬀ/mschulz/#software2

– 6 –

a possible period in the trial. The red line in the (a) panel is the FAP level of 0.01, which
gives a quantitative criterion for the detection of a minimum (Fan et al. 2010; Horne et al.
1986). The FAP was computed by a simple Monte Carlo method with N=10000. The (a)
panel suggests that the FAP level of the possible timescales of 289 ± 11.5 days is smaller
than 0.01 (FAP< 0.01).

The (b) panel of Figure 4 indicates that the timescales are 315 ± 5 and 630 ± 51.5 days
for X-ray light curves. Considering that 630 days is two times of 315 days, we infer that
315 ± 5 days is the possible period of X-ray light curve for Mrk 421, which is in agreement
with the results of 15 GHz. From the (c) panel of Figure 4, period of 278, 571 and 833 days
are conﬁrmed. Since the timescale of 278 days is about one half and third of the timescales
of 571 and 833 days, respectively, we think that 278 days is the possible period of γ-ray
variability for Mrk 421. The (b) and (c) panel also show that the FAP levels of the results
of X-ray and γ-ray are smaller than 0.01. Figure 4 implies that the variability timescales
derived by the Jurkevich method using 15 GHz, X-ray and γ-ray variability data of Mrk 421
are consistent.

3.3. The discrete correlation function (DCF) method and results

The discrete correlation function (DCF) (Edelson & Krolik 1988) is a powerful technique
to search for the correlation and time delay between two times series. For a single times
series, this method can be applied to seek the variability timescales in the time series. If
there is a true signal on timescale of Tpe in the variability time series, the DCF would attain
its maximum value at time delay τ = 0 and τ = Tpe. Namely, it will show a peak at the lags
τ = 0 and τ = Tpe.

The values of the DCF of each pair of data (ai, bj) can be calculated as follows: At ﬁrst,
we compute the set of unbinned discrete correlations (UDCF) of all pairs of data (ai, bj) by
the formula,

UDCFij =

,

(5)

(ai − ¯a)(bj − ¯b)

σaσb

where ¯a and ¯b are the average of the data sets, σa and σb are the corresponding standard
deviations. Each pair of data can be related to the pairwise lag △tij = tj − ti. Then, the
DCF (τ ) can be calculated by the formula,

where M is the number of pairs for which τ − △τ /2 ≤ △tij < τ + △τ /2, and τ is the time

DCF (τ ) =

lag. The standard error for each time lag τ is

– 7 –

σ(τ ) =

1

M − 1

{Σ[UDCFij − DCF (τ )]2}1/2.

(7)

The analytical results of DCF are displayed in Figure 5. Figure 5 suggests that the
periods Tpe derived by the DCF method are 186 and 281 days for 15 GHz light curves; 67,
202, and 310 days for the X-ray light curves; 86 and 288 days for the γ-ray light curves.

3.4. Periodicity results

Figure 2-5 and Table 1 give the results of the light curve of Mrk 421 at three diﬀerent
bands with three kinds of period analysis techniques. The foregoing analyses and Table 1
show that a certain result, 281.0-290.4 days for 15GHz variability dataset, 301.4-315.0 days
for X-ray variability dataset, 278-288 days for γ-ray variability dataset were conﬁrmed by
three kinds of period analysis methods. This also shows that the timescales 278 − 315 days
obtained from three diﬀerent wavelengths is consistent. From table 1, one can also ﬁnd the
other timescales, such as 181.9, 206.1 237.8, 186 days for 15 GHz, 67, 202 days for X-ray,
and 86 days for γ-ray, only appear in the result of a single method. Therefore, these results
should be excluded, and more observation are needed to conﬁrm them. Moreover, the Figure
1 shows that the light curves of Mrk 421 are dominated by the big 2012 ﬂare, which is most
likely not a periodic event. In order to study the extent of the ﬂare inﬂuence on the variability
timescales, we also subtract the 2012 ﬂare from the data. The excluded period, a shaded
area overlaid on Figure 1, is from MJD 56178 to 56230 for 15 GHz, and from
MJD 56109 to 56188 for γ-ray band. Moreover, the X-ray data of the 2012 ﬂare
is lost (see Figure 1, a gap at the same time interval). Then, we analyze the new
light curves removing the 2012 ﬂare data using the Lomb-Scargle periodogram
and Jurkevich methods, and Figure 6 gives the results. From Figure 6, one can ﬁnd
that the timescales is 279-288 days with FAP level smaller than 0.01, which is consistent with
the results obtained from the data containing the 2012 ﬂare data. Therefore, the impact of
the episodic ﬂares on the variability timescale is very small. Thus, the foregoing analyses
and Table 1 implies that there is a true period on timescale of 287.6 ± 4.4 days (the average
of 289.9, 290.4, 289, and 281 in the results of 15 GHz) in 15 GHz light curves, 309.5 ± 5.8
days (the average of 311.7, 301.4, 315, and 310 in the results of X-ray) in X-ray light curves,
283.4 ± 4.7 days (the average of 281.1, 286.6, 278, and 288 in the results of γ-ray) in γ-ray
light curves. The variability periodicity of three diﬀerent wavelengths is broadly consistent
with each other.

4. Correlation Analysis

The correlations in the variability can improve our understanding of the emission mech-
anisms of blazars. The DCF method can be used to calculate the correlation and time lag
between diﬀerent light curves. Thus, we will be looking for the correlations between the
variability of 15 GHz, X-ray and γ-ray using the DCF method. The Figure 7 gives the
correlation result calculated by the DCF method. From Figure 7, one can ﬁnd that there
is a signiﬁcant peak at the timescale of τ ≃ 52 days in the X-ray / 15 GHz panel; τ ≃ 55
days in the γ-ray / 15 GHz panel, and τ ≃ 2 days in the γ-ray / X-ray panel. This suggests
that the emission of radio 15 GHz lags behind that of X-ray, and the X-ray variability lags
the γ-ray variability. To assess the signiﬁcance of the correlation, we followed the approach
presented by Chatterjee et al. (2008). Firstly, we simulated 10000 light curves using the al-
gorithm recommended by Timmer & Koenig (1995) with a power law slope of 1.5 (Lico et al.
2014). The mean and standard deviation of the simulated curves is same with ones of the ob-
served light curves. Secondly, based on the original light curve, we resampled the simulated
curves. Thirdly, we analyzed the correlation of the simulated light curves, and identiﬁed
the peak in each of the correlations of the simulated curves. Finally, we compared the peak
values obtained from the simulated curves with the ones computed from the the observed
light curves. The results shows the signiﬁcance levels of the correlation between the X-ray
and 15 GHz, and γ-ray and 15 GHz, and γ-ray and X-ray are 85.82%, 100%, and 97.26%,
respectively. This implies that the emissions at 15 GHz, X-ray and γ-ray band are well
correlated. This agrees with the previous results obtained by many authors (e.g. Abdo et al.
2014; Balokovi´c et al. 2013; Bartoli et al. 2011; Bla`zejowski et al. 2005; Fossati et al. 2008;
Gaur et al. 2012; Lico et al. 2014; Richards et al. 2013; Smith et al. 2008; Ushio et al. 2010),
who found that there are clear correlations among diﬀerent energy regimes, and the lower
frequencies variations lag behind the higher frequencies variability.

5. Discussion and Conclusions

We presented the long term historical light curves of radio 15 GHz, X-ray and γ-ray
bands of Mrk 421, and analyzed the period of the light curves in the three diﬀerent wavebands
using various methods. Possible period on timescales of 287.6 ± 4.4 days in 15 GHz light
curves, 309.5 ± 5.8 days in X-ray light curves, 283.4 ± 4.7 days in γ-ray light curves were
conﬁrmed by three diﬀerent methods. The period of 283.4 − 309.5 days in 15 GHz, X-ray
and γ-ray bands light curves are similar with the variability timescale of 256 days reported
by Smith et al. (2008). The periodic variability may be associated with some physical time
scales, e.g. the lasting time of big outbursts or a total time intervals of many rapid ﬂares

– 9 –

close in time (Kartaltepe & Balonek 2007). Nevertheless, the light curves of 15 GHz, X-ray
and γ-ray presented in Figure 1 show that there are no any obvious activities lasting for
about 300 days. This shows that the variability on timescales of 283.4 − 309.5 days got in
this paper may be related to a periodic nature of the intrinsic variability.

For blazars, the emission is usually dominated by non-thermal emission from the rel-
ativistic jet, and the emission variability is caused by the disturbance propagating down
the jet. The cyclic variation may be usually ascribed to the seasonally changing beaming
eﬀects caused by the periodic change of the visual angle, providing a geometrical explana-
tion for the blazar emission variability (Britzen et al. 2009). The visual angle changing over
time suggests that the emitting material moves along a curved track. Many observational
phenomena of blazars have been explained by geometrical origin (e.g. Ostorero et al. 2004;
Raiteri et al. 2001; Britzen et al. 2009; Poon et al. 2009; Li et al. 2006, 2009, 2010, 2015;
Fuhrmann et al. 2006; Raiteri et al. 2011). The changing viewing angle can be explained in
the term of the bending jet, wiggling jet and the helical magnetic ﬁelds in jet (Li et al. 2015).
The supermassive binary black hole (SMBBH) model can oﬀer a suﬃcient interpretation for
the bending jet and wiggling jet (Li et al. 2015). Now, it is expected that SMBBH really
exists in the center of blazar (e.g. Begelman et al. 1980; Liu et al. 2014). The SMBBH model
has been successfully applied to explain a number of observational phenomena of blazar (e.g.
Chen et al. 2014; Britzen et al. 2012; Li et al. 2015; Valtonen et al. 2011; Sillanp¨a¨a et al.
1988; Tsalmantza et al. 2011). We assume that SMBBH exists in the center of Mrk 421 and
a helical magnetic ﬁeld exists in the jet. Chen et al. (2014) have interpreted the multiwave-
length behaviour of Mrk 421 using the SMBBH model. Therefore, the emitting material
would move along a asymmetrical curved track generated by the jet with a precession and
helical magnetic ﬁeld. This leads to a nonballistic helical motion for the emitting material
(Britzen et al. 2010; Li et al. 2015). The periodicity variability in the light curves of Mrk
421 on the timescale 283.4 − 309.5 days can be reasonably interpreted by the nonballistic
helical motion of the emitting material.

A multiwavelength cross-correlation analysis shows that there is a well correlation be-
tween the light curves of the radio 15 GHz, X-ray and γ-ray waveband, which is in agree-
ment with the conclusions obtained in literatures (e.g. Gaur et al. 2012; Balokovi´c et al.
2013; Abdo et al. 2014; Fossati et al. 2008; Smith et al. 2008; Ushio et al. 2010; Bartoli et al.
2011; Bla`zejowski et al. 2005; Richards et al. 2013). The correlation between the radio, X-
ray and γ-ray band can be best interpreted by the leptonic models (Giommi et al. 1999;
Tagliaferri et al. 2003). The spectral energy distributions of blazars from radio to γ-ray ener-
gies have two characteristic components. In leptonic scenarios, the lower-energy part of pho-
ton SED can be produced by synchrotron emission, and the high energy part of SED is pro-
duced by the inverse Compton (IC) scattering (Sambruna et al. 1996; Tagliaferri et al. 2003).

– 10 –

The source photons could be synchrotron photons (synchrotron self-Compton, SSC), or come
from the outer radiation ﬁelds of jet (external Compton, EC) (e.g. Dermer & Schlickeiser
1993; Dermer et al. 2009; Marscher & Travis 1996; Bla`zejowski et al. 2000). Our results in-
dicate that the variability timescales of Mrk 421 at radio 15 GHz, X-ray and γ-ray are
both consistent with each other, and the variations of the three wavebands are correlated.
This suggests that the radiations of three diﬀerent bands are from the electrons with same
property in the leptonic models. Namely, the emission of radio and X-ray is produced by
the synchrotron radiation process, and the γ-ray is produced by IC scattering from the syn-
chrotron photons. This is in agreement with the results obtained by many authors (e.g.
Abdo et al. 2014; Acciari et al. 2011; Aleksi´c et al. 2012; Balokovi´c et al. 2013; Gaur et al.
2012; Horan et al. 2009; Ushio et al. 2010), who suggest that emission of Mrk 421 is domi-
nated by the SSC processes.

In addition, our results also suggest that the emission of X-ray lag behind that of γ-
ray with a timescale about 2 days, and the emission of X-ray and γ-ray lead that of radio
with a timescale about 50 days. This time delay between diﬀerent wavebands could be
caused by the frequency stratiﬁcation expected in the shock-in-jet models (Gaur et al. 2012;
Marscher & Travis 1996; Max-Moerbeck et al. 2014; Wagner & Witzel 1995). In this model,
a moving radiation region, restricted to the jet, produces the radio to γ-ray activity, and the
moving emission region moves outward at the bulk jet speed βc (Max-Moerbeck et al. 2014).
In the process of moving, the high frequency radiation would become observable earlier than
the low frequency radiation, because the opacity region from the central engine of high fre-
quency radiation is smaller than that of low frequency radiation. That is, the low frequencies
variability lags behind the high frequencies variability is because the higher frequency emis-
sion originates from the upstream of the lower frequency emission (Max-Moerbeck et al.
2014). Hence, the emission variability should appear in higher frequencies ﬁrst, followed by
the lower frequencies. Thus, the emission of γ-ray would lead that of the X-ray band, and
the X-ray variability would lead the radio band.
