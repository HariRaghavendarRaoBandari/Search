SHELLABLE WEAKLY COMPACT SUBSETS OF C[0, 1]

J. LOPEZ-ABAD AND P. TRADACETE

Abstract. We show that for every weakly compact subset K of C[0, 1] with ﬁnite Cantor-
Bendixson rank, there is a reﬂexive Banach lattice E and an operator T : E → C[0, 1] such
that K ⊆ T (BE). On the other hand, we exhibit an example of a weakly compact set of C[0, 1]
homeomorphic to ωω + 1 for which such T and E cannot exist. This answers a question of M.
Talagrand in the 80’s.

1. Introduction

In the celebrated paper [9], W. Davis, T. Figiel, W. Johnson and A. Pelczynski showed

that every weakly compact operator between Banach spaces factors through a reﬂexive Banach

space. This fact relies on a general construction, arising from interpolation theory, which shows

that every weakly compact set in a Banach space is contained in the image of the unit ball

by an operator deﬁned on a reﬂexive Banach space. Analogous statements in the category of

Banach lattices and Banach algebras have been considered respectively by C. Aliprantis and O.

Burkinshaw in [2] and A. Blanco, S. Kaijser and T. J. Ransford in [7]. In the former paper,

it was shown that under some extra assumptions, a weakly compact operator between Banach

lattices can be factored through a reﬂexive Banach lattice. In [19], M. Talagrand showed that

these extra assumptions cannot be completely removed.

In fact, let us say that a set A in a Banach space X is shellable by reﬂexive Banach lattices

if there is a reﬂexive Banach lattice E and an operator T : E → X such that A ⊆ T (BE),
where BE denotes the unit ball of E. In [19], the author constructs a weakly compact set KT
of continuous functions on the interval [0, 1] which is not shellable by reﬂexive Banach lattices.
Associated to this compact set KT , one can consider a weakly compact operator T : ℓ1 → C[0, 1]
which cannot be factored through a reﬂexive Banach lattice. The compact set KT is small, as it
is homeomorphic to the ordinal ωω2
+1. It was naturally asked in [19] what is the smallest ordinal
α for which there is a weakly compact set K ⊂ C[0, 1] homeomorphic to α and not shellable by
reﬂexive Banach lattices. The main result of this note is that this ordinal is precisely ωω + 1.

Our proof has two parts. For the lower bound, we will use crucially that when K is a countable

compact space with ﬁnite Cantor-Bendixson rank then the space C(K) of continuous functions

on K has an unconditional basis, in fact it is isomorphic to c0. This implies that when K is
a countable weakly-compact subset of C[0, 1], the natural evaluation operator ξ ∈ C[0, 1]∗ 7→

C(K), ξ(µ)(p) :=R pdµ, p ∈ K, factors through a reﬂexive Banach lattice. From this, a simple

duality argument then shows that K is shellable by a reﬂexive Banach lattice.

For the upper bound we will construct a weakly compact set Kω ⊂ C(ωω2

+ 1) homeomorphic
to ωω which is not shellable by reﬂexive Banach lattices. It is well-known that on L1(µ) spaces,
weak-compactness, uniform integrability and the Banach-Saks property are equivalent. In [19],

uniform integrability in combination with martingale techniques was heavily used. In this paper,

instead of that we exploit the weak Banach-Saks property of L1.

2. Preliminaries

We shall make use of standard Banach space facts and terminology as may be found in

[1, 13, 14]. Throughout, BX denotes the unit ball of a Banach space X, that is BX = {x ∈
X : kxk ≤ 1}. Also, an operator will always refer to a bounded and linear map. Recall that
A ⊂ X is a Banach-Saks set if every (xn) ⊂ A has a Cesaro convergent subsequence (xnk ), that
is the arithmetic means 1
k=1 xnk are convergent. Recall that a reﬂexive Banach lattice E can
always be represented as a space of measurable functions on some probability space (Ω, Σ, µ)
such that L∞(µ) ⊂ E ⊂ L1(µ), with kf k1 ≤ kf kE [14, Theorem 1.b.12].
In particular, E∗
is also a space of measurable functions on (Ω, Σ, µ) and both BE and BE∗ are equi-integrable
sets in L1(µ) (or equivalently, Banach-Saks sets). A subset of a Banach lattice A ⊆ E is
solid when |x| ≤ |y| with y ∈ A implies that x ∈ A. Given a set A ⊆ E, we deﬁne its solid

nPn

hull sol(A) = {x ∈ E :

|x| ≤ |y| for some y ∈ A}. The reader is refered to [3, 14] for further

explanations concerning Banach lattices.

Recall the classical result by S. Mazurkiewicz and W. Sierpinski [16] that states that every
countable compact space K is homeomorphic to a unique ordinal number ωαK · nk + 1, nK ∈ N,
with its order topology. We will use here the fact that when K has ﬁnite Cantor-Bendixson

index, that is when αK is ﬁnite, then the corresponding space of continuous functions C(K) has
an unconditional basis, in fact, C(K) is isomorphic to c0. This is actually a characterization of
those compact spaces (see [1, Theorem 4.5.2] for more details).

Deﬁnition 2.1. Let Y be a Banach space, and X a collection of Banach spaces. A set K ⊂ Y

will be called X -shellable (or shellable by X ) if there is a space X in X and an operator T : X →
Y such that K ⊂ T (BX). In this case, we will write K ∈ ShX (Y ).

SHELLABLE WEAKLY COMPACT SUBSETS OF C[0, 1]

We will denote by ShX (Y ) the family of subsets K ⊂ Y which are X -shellable. In particular,
let ShR(Y ) and ShRL(Y ) be the collections of subsets of Y which are shellable by a reﬂexive
Banach space and by a reﬂexive Banach lattice, respectively. The following is easy to prove.

Proposition 2.1.

(a) ShX (Y ) is closed under subsets and convex hulls.

(b) If X is closed under ﬁnite direct sums, then ShX (Y ) is closed under ﬁnite unions.
(c) If Y0 is a complemented subspace of Y1, then ShX(Y0) = {W ⊆ Y0 : W ∈ ShX(Y1)}. (cid:3)

We recall the main construction in [9], later adapted in [2] to the lattice setting (see also [3,

Section 5.2]).

Theorem 2.2. Let W be a convex, circled, bounded subset of a Banach space X. There is

Banach space Y , and a continuous linear injection J : Y → X such that W ⊂ J(BY ).
addition,

In

(a) Y is reﬂexive if and only if W is relatively weakly compact.

(b) If X is a Banach lattice, and W is solid, then Y can be taken to be a Banach lattice.

It is not true in general that the solid hull of a weakly-compact set in a Banach lattice is

weakly-compact. Nevertheless, if X is a space with an unconditional basis, or if X is a Banach

lattice not containing c0, then every weakly compact set has weakly compact solid hull (see [8]
for more details). As a consequence we obtain the following.

Corollary 2.3. Let W be a relatively weakly-compact subset of a Banach space X. Then

(a) W is shellable by a reﬂexive Banach space.

(b) If X is a Banach lattice and W is solid, then W is shellable by a reﬂexive Banach lattice.

(c) If X has an unconditional basis, then W is shellable by a reﬂexive Banach lattice.

(d) If X is a Banach lattice that does not contain c0, then W is shellable by a reﬂexive Banach

lattice.

3. Main results

3.1. Lower bound. Let us begin this section with the lower bound concerning Talagrand’s

problem:

Theorem 3.1. Every countable weakly-compact subset of C[0, 1] of ﬁnite Cantor-Bendixson

rank is in ShRL(C[0, 1]).

Proof. Let us consider a countable weakly-compact subset K ⊆ C[0, 1] with ﬁnite Cantor-

Bendixson rank. Let

φ : C[0, 1]∗ → C(K)

SHELLABLE WEAKLY COMPACT SUBSETS OF C[0, 1]

4

given by φ(µ)(f ) = R f dµ for each µ ∈ C[0, 1]∗ and f ∈ K ⊂ C[0, 1]. Clearly, φ deﬁnes a

bounded linear operator with kφk ≤ max{kf k : f ∈ K}.

Let L = φ(BC[0,1]∗), which is a weakly compact subset of C(K). Since K has ﬁnite Cantor-
Bendixson rank, C(K) has an unconditional basis (en). Hence, by [3, Theorem 4.39], it follows
that its solid hull (with respect to the unconditional basis)

sol(L) = {Xn

anen ∈ C(K) : there isXn

bnen ∈ L such that |bn| ≤ |an| for all n}

is a weakly compact subset of C(K). Hence, by [2, Theorem 2.2], φ factors through a reﬂexive

Banach lattice E. More precisely, there is eφ : C[0, 1]∗ → E and an interval preserving lattice

homomorphism J : E → C(K) (with respect to the lattice structure induced by the uncondi-
tional basis (en) of C(K)) with sol(L) ⊂ J(BE) and kJk ≤ kφk, such that the following diagram
commutes:

C[0, 1]∗

●●●●●●●●●

eφ

φ

E

/ C(K)

<②②②②②②②②

J

Thus, we clearly have the dual diagram as follows:

C(K)∗

●●●●●●●●

J ∗

φ∗

E∗

/ C[0, 1]∗∗

:✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈

eφ∗

Let j : C[0, 1] → C[0, 1]∗∗ denote the canonical embedding in the bidual. Note that for every
f ∈ K we have that φ∗(δf ) = j(f ). Indeed, for every µ ∈ C[0, 1]∗ we have

φ∗(δf )(µ) = δf (φ(µ)) = µ(f ) = j(f )(µ).

Now, since φ∗ is w∗ − w continuous, we have that

φ∗(BC(K)∗) = φ∗(cid:0)cow∗

({±δf : f ∈ K})(cid:1) ⊂ cow({±φ∗(δf ) : f ∈ K}) ⊂ j(C[0, 1]),

so we actually have φ∗ : C(K)∗ → C[0, 1]. Let F be the (reﬂexive) sublattice of E∗ generated

by {J ∗(δf ) : f ∈ K}. Let T : F → C[0, 1], be the restriction of eφ∗ on F . Since for f ∈ K we

have that J ∗(δf ) ∈ kφkBF , and

T (J ∗(δf )) = φ∗(δf ) = f,

we have that K ⊆ kφkT (BF ) and the proof is ﬁnished.

3.2. Upper bound. We continue by proving that the Cantor-Bendixson rank ω + 1 is sharp.

The main result is the following.

Theorem 3.2. There is a weakly-compact subset of C[0, 1] homeomorphic to ωω + 1 which is
not shellable by reﬂexive Banach lattices.

In fact, we ﬁnd a weakly compact subset of C(ωω2

+ 1) homeomorphic to ωω + 1 which is
not shellable by reﬂexive lattices. This implies Theorem 3.2, since for any countable compact

space L its space of continuous functions C(L) can be isometrically embedded in C[0, 1] in a
complemented way (any such compact space is homeomorphic to a retract of {0, 1}N).

It is

more convenient to work with the appropriate compact families of ﬁnite subsets of N rather

than directly with ordinal numbers. Recall that a family F of ﬁnite subsets of an index set I

is considered as a topological space by identifying each element s of F with its characteristic
function, and then by considering the induced product topology on 2I . In particular, we will
consider the Schreier family

S = {s ⊂ N : ♯s ≤ min s}.

It is well-known that S is compact and homeomorphic to ωω + 1. The Schreier barrier S is the
family of maximal elements in S or equivalently, the set of isolated points of S. Explicitly,

S = {s ⊂ N : ♯s = min s}.

Since S is a scattered compact space, its set of isolated points S is dense in it. So it makes

sense to consider the following continuous extension property. Let us call a sequence (xs)s∈S a
weakly-convergent tree if the assignment s ∈ S 7→ xs ∈ E is continuous with respect to the weak
topology in E.

Lemma 3.3. Given a reﬂexive Banach space E and (xs)s∈S bounded in E, there is an inﬁnite
set M ⊆ N such that we can extend (xs)s∈S↾M to be a weakly convergent tree.

Proof. First of all, we can assume that (E, w) is metrizable with d. An induction argument

on n ∈ N gives that for every ε > 0, n ∈ N and any inﬁnite set M ⊆ N, there exists an inﬁnite
set N ⊆ M such that (xs)s∈[N ]≤n is a weakly convergent tree with

diamd((xs)s∈[N ]≤n) < ε.

Using this, one can ﬁnd a sequence (Mn)n∈N with Mn+1 ⊆ Mn ⊆ N, so that if mn = min Mn,
then (x{mn}∪s)s∈[Mn]≤mn−1 is a weakly convergent tree with d-diameter smaller than 1/n. Let
L ⊆ {mn}n∈N be such that xm →m∈L x∅. Then (xs)s∈S↾L is a weakly convergent tree.
(cid:3)

The previous Lemma generalizes to uniform families with a similar proof (see [5] for details

on uniform families).

SHELLABLE WEAKLY COMPACT SUBSETS OF C[0, 1]

We will also use the “square” of the Schreier family S2. Recall that given two families F and

G of ﬁnite subsets of N their product is

F ⊗ G := {

si : s1 < · · · < sn, si ∈ F for 1 ≤ i ≤ n and {min si}i ∈ G},

n[i=1

where s < t means max s < min t. Let S2 := S ⊗ S. Given n ∈ N, let Nn := [n, ∞[. Let

Fn := [Nn]≤n, Gn := S ⊗ [Nn]≤n, Fω := S and Gω := S2. Notice that Sn Fn = Fω and
Sn Gn = Gω. The families Fα, Gα, α ≤ ω are compact, hereditary and any restriction of them

have rank α + 1 and ω · α + 1, respectively. It is easy to show from the deﬁnition of S2 that each
element t ∈ S2 = S ⊗ S has a unique decomposition s = s[0] ∪ s[1] · · · ∪ s[n], where

(a) s[0] < s[1] < · · · < s[n],
(b) {min s[i]}i≤n ∈ S,
(c) s[0], · · · , s[n − 1] ∈ S and s[n] ∈ S.

Deﬁnition 3.1. Given s = {m0 < · · · < mk} ∈ S and t = t[0] ∪ · · · ∪ t[l] ∈ S2, let us denote

hs, ti = #({0 ≤ i ≤ min{k, l} : mi ∈ t[i]}).

Let Θ : S × S2 → {0, 1} be the mapping that to (s, t) ∈ S × S2 assigns

Θ(s, t) :=hs, ti + 1

mod 2.

(1)

Proposition 3.4. The mapping Θ is coordinate-wise continuous.

Proof. Since

Θ(s, t) =

1

2(cid:16)(−1)hs,ti + 1(cid:17),

we only need to prove that h·, ·i is a coordinate-wise continuous mapping. Suppose that sn →n s
in S, and ﬁx t ∈ S2. Let n0 be such that sn ∩ t = s ∩ t for every n ≥ n0. Then hsn, ti = hs, ti
for n ≥ n0. Similarly one proves the continuity with respect to the second variable.
(cid:3)

It is interesting to note that Talagrand’s compactum given in [19] can also be constructed as
Θ1(S2) where Θ1 : S2 → C(S) is the mapping t ∈ S2 7→ Θ1(t) := Θ(·, t) ∈ C(S). Similarly, let
Θ0 : S → C(S2) be the mapping s ∈ S 7→ Θ0(s) := Θ(s, ·) ∈ C(S2). Set

for α ≤ ω.

Kα := Θ0(Fα),

Lα := Θ1(Gα),

Proposition 3.5. Kα and Lα have Cantor-Bendixson rank α + 1 and ω · α + 1, respectively.

Proof. Since Θ0 and Θ1 are continuous, it follows that Kα and Lα have Cantor-Bendixson
index at most α + 1 and ω · α + 1, respectively. Since in addition, Θ1 is 1-1, it follows that Lα
has rank exactly ω · α + 1.

SHELLABLE WEAKLY COMPACT SUBSETS OF C[0, 1]

7

On the other hand, let M := {2n}n≥0. Then the restriction of Θ0 to Fα ↾ M := {s ∈ Fα :
s ⊆ M } is 1-1, which shows that the rank of Kα is α + 1. Suppose that s0 6= s1 are elements of
Fα ↾ M , s0 = {2i0 < · · · < 2ik−1 < 2ik < · · · < 2il}, and s1 = {2i0 < · · · < 2ik−1 < 2jk < · · · <
2jr }, with ik 6= jk, say ik < jk. For each m ≤ k, let tm := [2im , 2im+1 − 1] ∈ S. Then it follows

that 2im ∈ tm for every m ≤ k and 2jk /∈ tk. If we set t :=Sm≤k tm ∈ S2, then (tm)m≤k is the

canonical decomposition of t, hence hs0, ti = hs1, ti + 1, so Θ(s0, t) 6= Θ(s1, t).

(cid:3)

Deﬁnition 3.2. Let E be a Banach space and let α ≤ ω. By a (Θ, α)-embedding into E × E∗
we mean mappings γ0 : Fα ↾ M → E and γ1 : Gα ↾ M → E∗ for some inﬁnite M ⊆ N such that
(a) γ0 and γ1 are continuous, when we consider E with its weak-topology and E∗ with its

weak∗-topology, respectively.

(b) γ1(t)(cid:0)γ0(s)(cid:1) = Θ(s, t) for every (s, t) ∈ Fα ↾ M × Gα ↾ M .

The diameter of a (Θ, α)-embedding is

D(γ0, γ1) = sup{kγ0(s)kkγ1(t)k : (s, t) ∈ Fα ↾ M × Gα ↾ M }.

Theorem 3.6. No reﬂexive Banach lattice admits a (Θ, ω)-embedding. In fact, if (γ0, γ1) is a
(Θ, n)-embedding in a reﬂexive Banach lattice, then D(γ0, γ1) ≥ n.

Proof. Suppose otherwise, and ﬁx a (Θ, n)-embedding γ0 : Fn ↾ M → E and γ1 : Gn ↾ M → E∗.
To simplify the notation, we assume without loss of generality that M = N. For s ∈ Fn let
xs = γ0(s) ∈ E, and for t ∈ Gn let x∗

t = γ1(t) ∈ E∗.

Claim 3.6.1. There is a mapping ∆ : [N]≤n → S ∪ {∅} such that

(a) ∆(∅) = ∅, ∆(s) 6= ∅ for every #s < n, s 6= ∅, and for every s < m0 < m1,

s ||ys| > 1 + i − ε(1 + 5i).

We use the previous Claim 3.6.2 to ﬁnd a > 0 such that

U mZ|y∗

s∪{m}|>a

|y∗

s∪{m}||ys| < ε.

Since y∗

s , it follows that

U mZ |y∗

s∪{m}||ys| > 1 + i − ε(2 + 5i).

Combining (15) and (16) we obtain that

U mZ|y∗

s∪{m}|≤a

|y∗

s∪{m}||ys| > 1 + i − ε(3 + 5i).

Since ys∪{m}

k·kL1→ m ys, it follows from (17) that

On the other hand, given n we have from (3) that

From this last claim, we can ﬁnd s ∈ [N]n such that

Z |y∗

s ys| ≥ n.

Since, ys ∈ conv(cid:0)γ0(Fn)(cid:1) and y∗

Proposition 3.7. Let E be a reﬂexive Banach space.

s ∈ γ1(Gn), it follows that D(γ0, γ1) ≥ n.

(a) Suppose T : E → C(S2) is such that Kα ⊆ T (BE). Then there is a (Θ, α)-embedding in

E × E∗ with diameter less or equal than kT k.

(b) Suppose T : E → C(S) is such that Lα ⊆ T (BE). Then there is a (Θ, α)-embedding in

E∗ × E with diameter less or equal than kT k.

Proof. Suppose that T : E → C(S2) is such that Kα ⊆ T (BE). For each maximal s ∈ Fα
choose xs ∈ BE such that T (xs) = Θ0(s). From Lemma 3.3 there is an inﬁnite M ⊆ N such
that (γ0(s))s∈Fα↾M is a weakly convergent tree. Since T is weak-weak-continuous, it follows that
T (γ0(s)) = Θ0(s) for every s ∈ Fα ↾ M . For each t ∈ Gα, let γ1(t) := T ∗(δt). Then for every
(s, t) ∈ Fα ↾ M × Gα ↾ M one has that

γ1(t)(cid:0)γ0(s)(cid:1) = T ∗(δt)(cid:0)γ0(s)(cid:1) = δt(cid:0)T (γ0(s))(cid:1) = δt(cid:0)Θ0(s)(cid:1) = Θ(s, t).

Notice that kγ0(s)kkγ1(t)k ≤ kT ∗k = kT k, thus D(γ0, γ1) ≤ kT k.

(24)

Now, if T : E → C(S) is such that Lα ⊆ T (BE), then arguing as above, one could ﬁnd
M ⊆ N and a continuous γ1 : Gα ↾ M → E such that T (γ1(t)) = Θ1(t) for every t ∈ Gα ↾ M .

Let γ0 : Gα ↾ M → E∗, γ0(s) := T ∗(δs) for every s ∈ Gα ↾ M . Again, γ1(t)(cid:0)γ0(s)(cid:1) = Θ(s, t), and

we get D(γ0, γ1) ≤ kT k.

(cid:3)

As a consequence we get the following:

Corollary 3.8. Neither Kω nor Lω are shellable by reﬂexive Banach lattices. In fact, if T :
E → C[0, 1] is such that Kn or Ln ⊆ T (BE), then kT k ≥ n.

(cid:3)

Several important aspects of the geometric structure of C(Ω) spaces are closely related to

operators T : C(Ω) → C(Ω) (see [12, 17] for recent and complete accounts on this relation).

Note that the compact Kω and Lω constructed above are not contained in the image of the unit
ball by any weakly compact operator T : C[0, 1] → C[0, 1]. In fact, we have the following:

Proposition 3.9. Let Ω be a compact Hausdorﬀ space and K ⊂ C(Ω) a weakly compact set
such that K ⊆ T (BC(Ω)) for some weakly compact operator T : C(Ω) → C(Ω). Then K is in
ShRL(C(Ω)).

Proof. Since T is weakly compact, so is its adjoint. Now, C(Ω)∗ does not contain c0 so the
solid hull of T (BC(Ω)∗ ) is weakly compact. Thus, we could factor T ∗, and also T , through a
reﬂexive Banach lattice.
(cid:3)

The converse however is not true. In fact, it is not even true that a subset of C[0, 1] shellable
by a reﬂexive lattice is contained in T (BC[0,1]) for a weak Banach-Saks operator T : C[0, 1] →
C[0, 1]. Recall that an operator is weak Banach-Saks when it sends weakly compact sets to

Banach-Saks sets. Note that the Dunford-Pettis property of C[0, 1] yields in particular that

every weakly compact operator T : C[0, 1] → C[0, 1] is weak Banach-Saks. Now, suppose that

X is a copy of the Schreier space in C[0, 1] and let K = {0} ∪ {un}n where (un)n is the unit
basis of X. By Theorem 3.1, we have that K is in ShRL(C[0, 1]). If T : C[0, 1] → C[0, 1] is such
that K ⊆ T (BC[0,1]), then one can prove that its Szlenk index (see [17]) is at least ω2. Hence,
by a result of D. E. Alspach [4], T ﬁxes a copy of C(S), hence T cannot be weak Banach-Saks.

It was observed in [11] that Talagrand’s weakly compact set KT is a Banach-Saks set. Since
every space with the Banach-Saks property is reﬂexive, as a consequence of [19] it follows that

KT is not shellable by Banach lattices with the Banach-Saks property. In a similar spirit, one
might wonder what is the smallest ordinal α such that there exists a Banach-Saks set K ⊆ C[0, 1]

homeomorphic to α which is not shellable by Banach lattices with the Banach-Saks property.

It can be seen that the compact set Kω constructed before fails the Banach-Saks property.
However, in [15] an example was given of a Banach-Saks set whose convex hull is not Banach-

Saks, so it is not even shellable by Banach spaces with the Banach-Saks property. Note this set

is homeomorphic to ω + 1.
