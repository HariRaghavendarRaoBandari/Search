Abstract:
at the HIRFL-CSR facility in Lanzhou by employing the Isochronous Mass Spectrometry (IMS) method. The new
mass excesses of 52−54Sc nuclides are determined to be -40492(82), -38928(114), -34654(540) keV, which show a
signiﬁcant increase of binding energy compared to the reported ones in the Atomic Mass Evaluation 2012 (AME12).
In particular, 53Sc and 54Sc are more bound by 0.8 MeV and 1.0 MeV, respectively. The behavior of the two neutron
separation energy with neutron numbers indicates a strong sub-shell closure at neutron number N = 32 in Sc isotopes.

Key words:

Isochronous Mass Spectrometry, exotic nuclei, mass excess, new magic number.

Introduction

Atomic nuclei are many-body quantum systems com-
posed of two distinct types of fermions: protons and neu-
trons. Some special nuclei with certain conﬁgurations
of protons and neutrons are found to be more bound
and more stable than others [1]. These magic nuclei are
cornerstones of the nuclear shell model which was intro-
duced by Mayer and Jense more than 60 years ago [2].
Since then, how magic numbers evolve with extreme
proton-to-neutron ratios toward the drip lines has be-
come one of the research frontiers of nuclear physics. The
nuclear mass reﬂects the total complex eﬀect of strong,
weak and electromagnetic interactions among nucleons

[3, 4], and thus is a useful tool for this research.

Recently, studies of exotic nuclei, especially neutron-
rich nuclei, far away from the β-stability line have re-
sulted in some fruit. The 24O nucleus has been veriﬁed
to be doubly magic by three diﬀerent experiments [5–7],
conﬁrming the appearance of the new magic number N
= 16. On the other hand, several mass measurements of
neutron-rich Si, P, S and Cl isotopes [8–11] indicate the
reduction of the traditional N = 28 neutron shell gap.
This appearance or collapse of the magic number is often
believed to be caused by the change of the single-particle
level order [12].

In f p-shell nuclei, the magicity of N = 32 has been
substantially found in several experiments with Ca [13],

Ti [14], and Cr [15] isotopes by investigating the sys-
tematic behavior of the E(2+
1 ) energies with the neutron
number in the even-even nuclei of the corresponding iso-
topic chain. The new magic number N = 32 in Ca iso-
topes is also conﬁrmed by recent precision mass measure-
ments of 51,52Ca at the TITAN Penning trap facility [16]
and 53,54Ca with the multi reﬂection time-of-ﬂight mass
spectrometer of ISOTRAP at CERN [17].

In this paper, we report on the results

from
isochronous mass measurement of 86Kr projectile frag-
ments in the vicinity of N = 32 at the Institute of Mod-
ern Physics in Lanzhou, China. Most of our results are
in good agreement with the literature ones reported in
AME12 [18, 19], except for four nuclides: 52−54Sc and
56Ti. Masses of all nuclides of interest are re-evaluated.
With the new data, an N = 32 neutron shell gap en-
ergy in Sc isotopes is obtained, which is conspicuously
stronger than the former one determined from previous
data.

2 Experiment and Data Analysis

This experiment was performed at the HIRFL-CSR
accelerator facility [21]. The primary beam of 86Kr28+
ions was accumulated in the main Cooler Storage Ring
(CSRm) and then accelerated to an energy of 460.65
Mev/u. The 86Kr28+ ions were fast extracted and then
focused on a ∼15 mm thick beryllium target which was
placed at the entrance of the RIBLL2 (an in-ﬂight frag-
ment separator). The secondary ions were produced via
projectile fragmentation of 86Kr28+. Exotic fragments
were separated by the RIBLL2 and then injected to the
experimental Cooler Storage Ring (CSRe). Both RI-
BLL2 and CSRe were set to a ﬁxed magnetic rigidity of
Bρ = 7.6755 Tm for optimum transmission of 61Cr24+.
Other fragments within a Bρ-acceptance of about ±0.2%
of the RIBLL2-CSRe system were also transmitted and
stored. As a result, about 5 ions were simultaneously
stored in CSRe in each injection.

For various ions stored in the CSRe, their revolution
times T are a function of their mass-to-charge ratios m/q
and their velocities v in the ﬁrst order approximation as
follows [22–24]:

where γt
is the so-called transition point of the ring
[24, 25] and γ is the the relativistic Lorentz factor. In the
IMS experiment, the ring is tuned to a special ion-optical
mode [26] allowing the faster ions of a certain ion species
always to circulate in longer orbits while the slower ones
are in correspondingly shorter orbits. The energy of the
primary beam was chosen such that the isochronous con-
dition γ ≈ γt is fulﬁlled. Hence, the velocity spread of

injected ions is compensated by their orbit lengths and
thus the revolution times directly reﬂect m/q ratios of
the stored ions [27].

At each revolution, the stored ions passed through
a dedicated timing detector [28] equipped with a 19
µg/cm2 thin carbon foil of 40 mm in diameter installed
inside CSRe. When passing through, the ions lose energy
so that secondary electrons are released from this foil.
These electrons were collected by a set of micro-channel
plates, thus forming a time stamp for each revolution.
The revolution times of all stored ions used in further
analysis were extracted from these time stamps. More
details can be found in Refs [29, 30].

This experiment lasted for about ﬁve days. The in-
stabilities of the CSRe magnetic ﬁelds caused drifts of
the entire revolution times and thus limited the achiev-
able mass resolving power for all ions. We applied a
new data analysis method, as described in Ref [31], to
minimize the eﬀect of such instabilities. By accumulat-
ing the results of each injection and carefully correcting
the eﬀect of instability of the magnetic ﬁeld, a common
revolution time spectrum was obtained, from which nu-
clides were identiﬁed applying the method described in
Refs [23, 29]. Fig. 1 shows a revolution time spectrum
of most nuclides within a range of 603 ns ≤ t ≤ 622 ns.

termined in this experiment and those used as ref-
erences are indicated with bold and italic letters,
respectively.

To calibrate the mass values of stored ions from that
spectrum, a third polynomial function was utilized to
describe the relationship between m/q ratios and revo-
lution times T . In this calibration, twelve nuclides with
accurately known masses [19] were selected as reference
to deduce the freely ﬁtted parameters of Eq.(2), and thus
masses of interested nuclides can be obtained by interpo-
lating the ﬁtting function to the corresponding revolution
time T .

In order to evaluate the reliability of our results,
we re-determined the masses of each of the twelve ref-
erence nuclides by calibrating the spectrum with the
other eleven nuclides. The comparison between the re-
determined mass values and those in the literature are
presented in Fig. 2. The normalized χn value was deﬁned
as:

with n = 12 in our case. The obtained value of χn = 1.45
is slightly out of the expected range of χn = 1 ± 0.24 at
the 1σ conﬁdence level, which means that an additional
systematic error σsys = 35 keV must be required.

The results from TOFI1 [33] show that the two nuclides
are more than 1 MeV unbound compared to the three
former experiments. This is similar to the situation
for 52Ca, for which an increase of 1.74 MeV in bind-
ing energy was discovered by the precise Penning-trap
measurement established at TITAN [16]. As a conse-
quence, we think that the results from TOFI1 might
need to be revised. The results from TOFI3 [35], al-
though with large uncertainties, also disagree for 53Sc.
However, AME12 only adopted the recent results of the
two nuclides from MSU [20]. The MSU data show that
the two nuclides are more unbound by about 0.8 MeV
and 1.0 MeV compared to the three experiments which
support each other. Moreover, for 53Sc, the MSU data
agree with the result from TOFI1 but not with TOFI3,
while the conclusion for 54Sc was the reverse. Hence, the
choice for the two nuclides in AME12 seems to be ques-
tionable. In our re-evaluation, we employed results from
CSRe, GSI and TOFI2 and the re-evaluated values are
displayed in Table 2.

For 52Sc, the results from CSRe and three TOFI ex-
periments agree well with each other. However, we still
only adopt results from CSRe and TOFI2 to be consis-
tent with the choice for 53Sc and 54Sc.

For 56Ti, the situation is more complicated, as even
the results from CSRe, GSI and TOFI2 disagree slightly
with each other. We have to ignore the dispute, and give
a suggested mass excess value adopting the results from
all three chosen experiments as mentioned above. More
precise mass experiments for this nuclide are necessary
to shed light on this conﬂict.

3 Results and discussion

Our new mass excess (ME) values of nuclides of inter-
est as well as corresponding ones reported in AME12 [19]
are presented in Table 1. Most of our results are in good
agreement with those in the literature at the 1σ con-
ﬁdence level except for four nuclides 52−54Sc and 56Ti.
Our ME values of these four nuclides are smaller by
1.8σ, 2.8σ, 1.6σ and 1.9σ than the corresponding ones in
AME12. For nuclides with consistent mass values, our
results are included in a new atomic mass evaluation.
The re-evaluated mass values are the weighted averages
of our ME values and corresponding values from the lit-
erature and are presented in Table 1.

For the four nuclides with observed deviations, we
investigated further and found that there were six corre-
sponding direct mass measurements. ME values of the
four nuclides from these experiments are presented in
Table 2.

For 53Sc and 54Sc, results from CSRe, GSI [32] and
TOFI2 [34] are in excellent agreement with each other.

The mass excesses or binding energies reﬂect the total
eﬀect of interactions within nuclei and provide essential
information about the ordering of single-particle energies
in exotic regions of the nuclear chart. As can be seen in
Fig. 3, our results show the decrease in mass excess leads
to a distinct variation of the two neutron separation en-
ergy S2n in the vicinity of N = 32 and Z = 20. S2n is
deﬁned as S2n = M E(N, Z − 2) + 2M E(n) − M E(N, Z),
where N and Z are neutron numbers and proton num-
bers, respectively. To better understand the behavior of
the S2n with increasing neutron number in this region,
new 53,54Ca data from ISOTRAP [17] are also included.

Solid symbols connected by solid lines represent

from AME12 while hollow ones are estimated
in AME12. Red solid circles connected by red
dashed lines are derived from mass values from
our work, and blue solid triangles are derived from
53,54Ca mass values from Ref [17].

The consequent behavior of S2n with increasing neu-
tron number in the Sc isotopic chain is dramatically ﬂat-
ter from N = 30 to N = 32. This is in line with the
behavior in the K and Ca isotopic chains, as discussed
in Refs [16, 17] and explained theoretically by the eﬀect
of three nucleon (3N) forces.

From N = 32 to N = 33, the drop of S2n occurs in
both Ca and Sc isotopic chains and is as steep as the drop

from N = 28 to N = 29. The latter manifests the eﬀect
of the traditional neutron magic number 28. Hence, the
former is substantial evidence of the persistence of N =
32 magicity in the Sc isotopes. Although this magicity
has been well established by many experiments as intro-
duced in the introduction, it is conﬁrmed in an odd-Z
isotopic chain for the ﬁrst time.

symbols connected by solid lines represent val-
ues based completely on experimental data from

53Sc mass values from our work and 51,55Sc from
AME12, while the blue solid triangle is derived
from 50,52Ca mass values from AME12 and 54Ca
from Ref [17].

The strength of this sub-shell closure can be eval-
uated via the neutron shell gap energy, deﬁned as the
diﬀerence of two neutron separation energy ∆(N, Z) =
S2n(N, Z) − S2n(N + 2, Z). Fig. 4 illustrates the system-
atic behavior of empirical neutron shell gap energy with
neutron number in Ca, Sc, and Ti isotopic chain. The
distinct peak of neutron shell gap energy at N = 28
demonstrates the traditional neutron magic number 28
again. One can see that the shell gap for 52Ca is almost
4 MeV, which unambiguously establishes a prominent
shell closure at N = 32 in Ca isotopes [17]. For 53Sc, the
shell gap value obtained from our data is more than 4

MeV and is about 2 MeV stronger than the former one
obtained from AME12, although these two values both
have large uncertainties.

4 Summary

The results of an isochronous mass measurement of
86Kr projectile fragments are presented in this paper.
Our results show that 53Sc and 54Sc are stonger bound by
0.8 MeV and 1.0 MeV than the literature values reported
in AME12, respectively. However, our results agree per-
fectly with two other experiments, which are not adopted

in AME12. It seems that the data selections in AME12
for these two nuclides are not very reasonable. Mass val-
ues of the nuclides of interest are re-evaluated including
our new data. The large increase in binding energies of
53Sc and 54Sc suggests the persistence of the new neutron
magic number N =32 in Sc isotopes, which has already
been conﬁrmed in the Ca isotopic chain by several ex-
periments. The physics behind this phenomena is still
under exploration.

We thank Professor Georges Audi for very helpful dis-
cussion about Atomic Mass Evaluation and data analy-
sis.
