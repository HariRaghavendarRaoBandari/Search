MINIMAL SURFACES IN THE PRODUCT OF TWO

DIMENSIONAL REAL SPACE FORMS ENDOWED WITH A

NEUTRAL METRIC

MARTHA P. DUSSAN, NIKOS GEORGIOU, MARTIN MAGID

Abstract. We investigate minimal surfaces in products of two-spheres S2
×S2
p,
with the neutral metric given by (g, −g). Here S2
⊂ Rp,3−p , and g is the
induced metric on the sphere. We compute all totally geodesic surfaces and
we give a relation between minimal surfaces and the solutions of the Gordon
equations. Finally, in some cases we give a topological classiﬁcation of compact
minimal surfaces.

Introduction

There has been an explosion of recent papers which consider products of space
of constant curvature as ambient spaces. In particular Harold Rosenberg and his
co-authors have looked at constant mean curvature submanifolds in products for
a long time, beginning with [8]. The surface theory in products of two-spheres or
the product of hyperbolic planes has been of great interest and has been studied
extensively in the two articles [3] and [11].

In this article, our ambient spaces are the products S2×S2, H2×H2 and dS2×dS2.
Each such four manifold is the space L+(M 3) (resp. L−(M 3)) of spacelike (resp.
timelike) oriented geodesics in a certain 3-manifold (M 3, g). In particular, L+(S3) =
S2 × S2, L+(AdS3) = H2 × H2 and L−(AdS3) = dS2 × dS2 and we simply write
L±(M 3) to denote these three manifolds. It is well known, that L±(M 3) enjoys
two natural K¨ahler or para-K¨ahler structures with the same symplectic structure Ω
such that the one metric (denoted by G) is of neutral signature, locally conformally
ﬂat and scalar ﬂat, while the other (denoted by ¯G) is Einstein (see [1] and [2]).
Furthermore, G and ¯G are invariant under the group action of the isometry group
g.

There is interesting relation between the surface theory of the space L±(M 3) of
oriented geodesics with the surface theory of M 3. In particular, the set of oriented
geodesics L(S) that are orthogonal to a surface S in M 3 form a Lagrangian surface
in L±(M 3) with respect to the symplectic structure Ω. For example, L(S) is ﬂat
with respect to the neutral metric G, if and only if, S is Weingarten, that is, its
principal curvatures are functionally related (see [2], [6] and [7]). Furthermore, G-
minimal Lagrangian surfaces in L±(M 3) are orthogonal to equidistant tubes along
a geodesic in M 3. The study of minimal Lagrangian surfaces in L±(M 3) with

respect to the Einstein metric G′ have been studied by many authors (see [3], [9]
and [11]).

Torralbo and Urbano in [10], have studied G′-minimal surfaces in L(S3) = S2×S2
which, inspired us to investigate G-minimal surfaces in L±(M 3) = S2 × S2, H2 × H2
and dS2 × dS2. This leads to new, interesting examples of minimal surfaces in
S2 × S2 and dS2 × dS2, as well as a classiﬁcation of the totally geodesic surfaces.
Our debt to them is clear throughout this paper.

1. Surfaces in S2

Consider the real space R3, endowed with the pseudo-Riemannian metric

Note that the 2-sphere S2 = S2

1 + dx2
For δ ∈ {−1, 1}, we deﬁne the 2-dimensional complete quadric S2

of signature (p, 3 − p), with p = 1, 2. For p = 0, deﬁne h., .i0 = dx2
2 + dx2
3.
p,δ := {x ∈
R3| hx, xip = δ}, endowed with the induced metric g obtained by the canonical
inclusion S2
p,δ ֒→ (R3,h., .ip). The metric g has signature (p, 2 − p) if δ = 1 and
(p − 1, 3 − p) if δ = −1. Furthermore g is of constant Gauss curvature K g = δ.
0,1 and the hyperbolic plane H2, which is anti-
2,1 ∩ {x ∈ R3| x3 > 0}, are the only Riemannian quadrics, while the
isometric to S2
de Sitter 2-space dS2 = S2
1,1, which is anti-isometric to the anti de Sitter 2-space
AdS2 = S2
2,−1, are the only Lorentzian quadrics. Since we can get all the cases by
looking at −g we only consider the case where δ = 1. For simplicity we replace S2
p,1
with S2
p
p as jx(v) := −x×v.

If g is Riemannian, we can deﬁne a complex structure j in T S2

The formula

shows that j is an isometry.

ha × b, a × di = ha, aihb, di − ha, dihb, ai

In the case where S2

p is the de Sitter 2-space dS2, the paracomplex structure j
can be deﬁned as follows: If R1,2 denotes the Lorentzian space (R3,h,i1), we deﬁne
the Lorentzian cross product ⊗ in R1,2 by

u ⊗ v := I1,2 · (u × v),

hu ⊗ v, u ⊗ wi1 = − hu, ui1 hv, wi1 + hu, vi1 hu, wi1 .

where u × v is the standard cross product in R3 and I1,2 = diag(−1, 1, 1). For
u, v, w ∈ R3 we have
(1.1)
The paracomplex structure j on dS2 is given by jx(v) := −x ⊗ v, where v ∈ R3 is
such that hx, vi1 = 0. It can be veriﬁed easily that x ⊗ (x ⊗ v) = v.
p, g, j), where j is the (para-)complex structure as deﬁned be-
fore, (i.e., j2 = (−1)p+1Id) we may deﬁne the K¨ahler 2-form, ω(., .) := g(j., .)
and therefore the quadruples (S2
p, g, j, ω) are 2-dimensional K¨ahler structures for
p = 0, 2, while for p = 1 the quadraple (dS2, g, j, ω) is a para-K¨ahler structure.

For the triples (S2

On the product S2

p, deﬁne two (para-)complex structures J1, J2 by
J1 = j ⊕ j,

J2 = j ⊕ −j,

and the symplectic structures Ω1, Ω2 by

2 ω.

G(., .) = (−1)p+1Ω1(J1., .) = (−1)p+1Ω2(J2., .).

Observe that G is of signature (+ + −−) and is called a neutral metric. The
Levi-Civita connection ∇ with respect to the metric G is given by

∇X Y = (DX1 Y1, DX2Y2),

where X = (X1, X2), Y = (Y1, Y2) are vector ﬁelds in S2
p and D denote the
Levi-Civita connection with respect to g. If p = 0 or p = 2, the endomorphisms
J1, J2 are both almost complex structures and then

p × S2

Ωk(X, Y ) = Ωk(JkX, JkY ) = −G(X, JkY ) = G(JkX, Y ).

If p = 1, the endomorphisms J1, J2 are both almost paracomplex structures. Thus,

Ωk(X, Y ) = −Ωk(JkX, JkY ) = −G(X, JkY ) = G(JkX, Y ).

We then have:

Proposition 1. [2], [4] The quadruples (S2

If πk : S2

p : (x1, x2) 7→ xk is the k-th projection, and F is an
p, we deﬁne the maps F1, F2 : Σ → S2
immersion of an oriented surface Σ in S2
by Fk := πk ◦ F , where k = 1, 2 and we write F = (F1, F2). The Jacobians of F1
and F2 are deﬁned by

F ∗

k ω = Jac(Fk) ωΣ,

k = 1, 2.

Then,

Jac(F1) = (C1 + C2)/2,

Jac(F2) = (−C1 + C2)/2.

Note also that we have a class of Lagrangian surfaces:

Example 1. Any product of non-null curves deﬁned by F1(x, y) = φ(x) and

F2(x, y) = ψ(y) which use arc-length parameters is Lagrangian.

Let {e1, e2} be an orthonormal frame with respect to F ∗G such that |e1|2 =
ǫ|e2|2 = 1, where ǫ ∈ {−1, 1} and is oriented such that e1 = e2 and e2 = −ǫe1.
Then  is a complex structure when ǫ = 1 while,  is a paracomplex structure when

4

MARTHA P. DUSSAN, NIKOS GEORGIOU, MARTIN MAGID

ǫ = −1. Furthermore,  is compatible with (F ∗G, ωΣ) and thus ωΣ(., .) = F ∗G(., .).
Hence,

(1.3)

ωΣ(e1, e2) = F ∗G(e1, e2) = F ∗G(e2, e2) = ǫ.

p such that |s1|2 = (−1)p|s2|2 =
Consider an oriented orthonormal frame (s1, s2) of S2
1 and js1 = s2 and js2 = (−1)p+1s1. Deﬁne the functions λk, ˜λk, µk, ˜µk on Σ by

dF1(e1) = λ1s1 + λ2s2,
dF2(e1) = ˜λ1s1 + ˜λ2s2,

dF1(e2) = µ1s1 + µ2s2,

dF2(e2) = ˜µ1s1 + ˜µ2s2

If R and K g = 1 denote the Riemann and the Gauss curvature of g, respectively,
we have

g(R(s1, s2)s2, s1) = K g(g(s1, s1)g(s2, s2) − g(s1, s2)2) = (−1)p.

The Riemann curvature tensor ¯R of G satisﬁes

(1.4)

¯R(e1, e2, e2, e1) = (−1)p((λ1µ2 − λ2µ1)2 − (˜λ1 ˜µ2 − ˜λ2 ˜µ1)2)

On the other hand, from (1.2) and (1.3), we have

ǫC1 = ωΣ(e1, e2)C1

= (−1)p(λ1µ2 − λ2µ1 − ˜λ1 ˜µ2 + ˜λ2 ˜µ1).

(1.5)

Similarly, we ﬁnd

(1.6)

ǫC2 = (−1)p(λ1µ2 − λ2µ1 + ˜λ1 ˜µ2 − ˜λ2 ˜µ1),

and therefore, the relation (1.4) becomes

Note also that,

¯R(e1, e2, e2, e1) = (−1)pC1C2.

R(e1, e2, e2, e1) = ǫK.

If K denotes the Gauss curvature of F ∗G, the Gauss equation of F gives:

(1.7)

K = ǫ(−1)pC1C2 + 2|H|2 − |h|2

,

where h, H are the second fundamental form and the mean curvature, respectively
and |h|2 := |h(e1, e1)|2 + |h(e2, e2)|2 + 2ǫ|h(e1, e2)|2. Notice that, if {e′
2} is
another orthonormal frame the function |h|2 is invariant.
The following Proposition follows directly from (1.7).

Proposition 2. Every totally geodesic Lagrangian immersion in S2
respect to either (G, Ω1, J1) or (G, Ω1, J1), is ﬂat.

Using (1.5) and (1.6) we have,

ǫ(−1)p(−C1 + C2)

= ǫ(−1)pJac(F2).

Let {e1, e2} be an oriented orthonormal frame of F ∗G given as before and let
{v1, v2} be sections of the normal bundle such that {e1, e2, v1, v2} is an oriented
orthonormal frame of G. Then,

¯R(e1, e2, v2, v1) = 0.

5

The curvature K ⊥ of the normal bundle is K ⊥ = R⊥(e1, e2, v2, v1), where R⊥ is
the Riemann curvature tensor of the normal connection ∇⊥. The Ricci equation
gives

K ⊥ = ¯R(e1, e2, v2, v1) + G([Av2 , Av1]e1, e2),

where A denotes the shape operator of F . But, ¯R(e1, e2, v2, v1) = 0 and therefore,
the Ricci equation becomes

(1.8)

K ⊥ = G([Av2 , Av1 ]e1, e2).

2. Minimal surfaces

We now study minimal surfaces in (S2

p, G) which will be referred as G-

minimal surfaces.

p × S2

Deﬁnition 2. Let F be an immersion of a surface Σ in S2
p. A point in Σ is
said to be a (para-) complex point with respect to the (para-)complex structure Jk
if the tangent plane of the surface is preserved by Jk. The immersion F is said to
be a (para-) complex curve in S2
p if all points are (para-)complex points with
respect to either J1 or J2.

induced metric F ∗G such that hFx, Fxip = ǫ hFy, Fyip = e2u and hFx, Fyip = 0.
Note that for ǫ = 1, the induced metric is Riemannian, in the sense that every
non-zero tangent vector ﬁeld has positive length. Analogously, we could consider
the negative deﬁnite case where each tangent vector ﬁeld has negative length.

Furthermore we can see that for isothermal coordinates:

C1ǫe2u = g(jF1(∂x), F1(∂y)) − g(jF2(∂x), F2(∂y))
C2ǫe2u = g(jF1(∂x), F1(∂y)) + g(jF2(∂x), F2(∂y)).

We now introduce the conformal variable z := x + iy, with i2 = −ǫ. In other
words, z is a complex variable when ǫ = 1 while, z is a paracomplex variable when
ǫ = −1. We then have the following operators:

Furthermore, (2.6) and (2.7) come directly from diﬀerentiating both expressions of
(2.2) with respect to z and using the following expressions
(J1Fz)z = 2(iuzC1 + be−2u¯γ1f1)Fz + 2be−2uγ1f2F¯z + (2ǫuzγ1 − iC1f1)ξ + iC1f2 ¯ξ,

The septuple (u, Cj, γj, fj

the complexifed normal bundle then there is a function θ such that ξ∗ = expǫ(iθ)ξ,

Proof. We diﬀerentiate with respect to z and ¯z the relations in (2.2) and then by
(2.6) and (2.7) we obtain (2.9) and (2.11). Finally using the relation Fz ¯zz = Fzz ¯z
we obtain (2.10).
(cid:3)

Given (para-)complex functions u, Cj, γj, fj satisfying (2.9), (2.10) and (2.11),
the following Proposition proves that there exists a unique minimal surface with
Riemannian induced metric, whose fundamental data is (u, Cj, γj, fj : j = 1, 2).

Proposition 7. Let Σ be a smooth surface and u, A, Cj, γj, fj, j = 1, 2, be com-
plex functions with Cj non-constant so that (2.9), (2.10), (2.11) and (2.12) hold.
Suppose that γj vanishes in at most isolated points. Then there exist, up to congru-
ences, a unique minimal immersion F : Σ → S2
p that is non-(para) complex, and
an orthonormal frame of the complexiﬁed normal bundle {ξ, ¯ξ} whose fundamental
data is (u, Cj, γj, fj : j = 1, 2).
Proof. From the deﬁnition of A, where γj 6= 0 we have

p×S2

(γj)z = (−1)jAγj + 2uzγj − 2iǫCjfj.

From γj z ¯z = γj ¯zz and using (2.9), (2.10), (2.11) and (2.12), we get

(2.13)

2uz ¯z + 4ǫe−2u|fj|2 + (−1)j( ¯Az + A¯z) + ǫ(−1)pe2uC1C2/2 = 0.

Using now (2.13), a brief computation shows Fzz ¯z = Fz ¯zz and ξ¯zz = ξz ¯z, which are
the integrability conditions of the Frenet system.

To end this subsection, we note that at the (para-)complex points with respect
to the (para-)complex structure Jk of a minimal immersion F , the Frenet equations
and the fundamental data (u, Cj, γj, fj) are given by the Propositions 5 and 6 by
setting γk = fk = 0 and C 2

Example 2. The slices S2

with respect to both J1 and J2.

p × q and q × S2

p are the only surfaces that are complex

Example 3. Consider the inverse stereographic projection function from R2 →

S2 given by

s(x, y) =(cid:18)

2x

x2 + y2 + 1

,

2y

x2 + y2 + 1

,

x2 + y2 − 1
x2 + y2 + 1(cid:19) .

Take any locally holomorphic function w(z) = (u(x, y) + iv(x, y)) and consider the
immersion F (x, y) = (s(x, y), s(u(x, y), v(x, y))). A straight-forward computation
shows that this is a J1 complex curve in S2
0. The only thing needed for this to
work is the Cauchy Riemann equations. The coordinates are isothermal. One has
to check that the metric is deﬁnite. This is not automatic; if we look at u(x, y) = −y
and v(x, y) = x the metric is totally degenerate.
In general the immersion is deﬁnite oﬀ a one-dimensional manifold in the domain.

0 × S2

For example, if w(z) = z2 then

G(Fx, Fx) =

4(cid:0)3x4 + 8x3 + 6x2(cid:0)y2 + 1(cid:1) + x(cid:0)8y2 + 4(cid:1) + y2(cid:0)3y2 + 2(cid:1)(cid:1)

(x2 + y2 + 1)2 (2x2 + 2x + 2y2 + 1)2

which is zero, on the circles (x + 1)2 + y2 = 1.

Thus we get a wealth of distinct complex curves.

Example 4. This is the same example modiﬁed for the para-complex case. Here

inverse stereographic projection is:

σ(t, s) =(cid:18)

2t

,

2s

s2 − t2 + 1

s2 − t2 + 1

,

s2 − t2 − 1
s2 − t2 + 1(cid:19) .

Take any locally para-holomorphic function w(t + is) = (u(t, s) + iv(t, s)) and con-
sider the immersion F (x, y) = (σ(x, y), σ(u(t, s), v(t, s))). The same computation
shows that this is a J1 para-complex curve in dS2 × dS2 using the fact that ut = vs
and us = vt. The coordinates are isothermal. One has to check that the metric
is non-degenerate, which is not always the case. Indeed using u(t, s) = t/(t2 − s2)
and v(t, s) = s/(t2 − s2), which come from 1/z yields a totally degenerate metric.
But, for example z2 and the function w = s + it both are non-degenerate

Again this is a large family of examples.

2.3. The general case. We have the following
Proposition 10. Let F : Σ → S2
p be a minimal immersion of an orientable

F ∗G, respectively and j ′ := 3 − j. We use this latter symbol from now on.
Proof. Assuming that the surface Σ is minimal, the normal curvature, given in
(1.8), becomes

K ⊥ = 2[G(h(e1, e1), v1)G(h(e1, e2), v2) − G(h(e1, e1), v2)G(h(e1, e2), v1)],

where h denotes the mean curvature of Σ, and {e1, e2}, {v1, v2} are orthonormal
frames of the tangent and the normal bundle, respectively, such that {e1, e2, v1, v2}
is an oriented orthonormal frame.

A brief computation gives,

On the other hand, the Gauss curvature K is:

K ⊥ = 4ǫe−4u(|f1|2 − |f2|2).

K = −4ǫe−2uuz ¯z.

• C1C2 = 0.

Assume, without loss of generality, that C1 = 0. We prove that C2 = 0. Since
f1 = f2 = 0, we use (2.18) to get

a1 = a2 = 0,

which yields K = K ⊥ = 0. Then from (2.15), we have that ∆C1 = −C2 = 0 and
thus Σ is locally the product of geodesics in S2
p.

(b) ⇒ (c) This is trivial.
(c) ⇒ (a) Suppose that the K¨ahler functions C1 and C2 are both constant. We

prove that F is totally geodesic. We use (2.9) to obtain

¯γ1f1 = ¯γ2f2 = 0.

• Assume, without loss of generality, that γ1(q) 6= 0.

We know that γ1 6= 0 in a neighborhood of a Then, from (2.20), we have f1 = 0 in
that neighborhood and therefore, using (2.10) for j = 1, we have C2 = 0. On the
other hand, from (2.15), we get

0 = ∆C2 = −C1,

and thus C1 = C2 = 0, which is locally the product of geodesics in S2
F is G-totally geodesic.

• We now assume, without loss of generality, that γ1(q) = 0.

This implies that C1 = 1, so that f1 = 0 and if, in addition, f2 = 0, we have that F
is G-totally geodesic. If f2 6= 0, then (2.20) shows that γ2 = 0 and thus F is a (para-
)complex curve with respect to both J1 and J2. Here, the structure equations of F
are no longer valid and so we can not apply them. We then consider local isothermic
coordinates (x, y) of the induced metric F ∗G such that hFx, Fxip = ǫ hFy, Fyip = e2u
and hFx, Fyip = 0. From the deﬁnition of the K¨ahler functions C1, C2 in (1.2), and
using the fact that Jk : T Σ → T Σ, we have that

JkFx = CkFy,

JkFy = −ǫCkFx,

and if z = x + iy, we have JkFz = iCkFz.

hh(Fz, Fz), ξi = (−1)p hJ2h(Fz, Fz), J2ξi

= − hh(Fz, Fz), ξi ,

which shows that

(2.21)

hh(Fz, Fz), ξi = 0.

(cid:10)h(Fz, Fz), ¯ξ(cid:11) = 0.

Hence (2.21) and (2.22) gives h(Fz, Fz) = 0. The fact that F is G-minimal implies
that h(Fz, F¯z) = 0 and therefore h = 0.
(cid:3)

Following [10], the next Proposition gives a relation between the solutions of the

various Gordon equations equations and minimal surfaces.
Proposition 11. Let F : Σ → S2
p, be a minimal immersion of an orientable
surface without complex points. Let C1 and C2 be the K¨ahler functions of F . Then,
we have the following:
(1) If p ∈ {0, 2} and the induced metric F ∗G is Riemannian, there exist smooth
functions v, w : Σ → R satisfying the following sinh-Gordon equations:

p × S2

If λC1C2 > 0, where λ ∈ {−1, 1}, then

vz ¯z + λ|hJ1Fz, J2Fzi|

sinh 2v = 0, wz ¯z + λ|hJ1Fz, J2Fzi|

sinh 2w = 0.

(2) If p = 1 and the induced metric F ∗G is Lorentzian, there exist smooth functions
v, w : Σ → R satisfying the following equations:

• If |C1| < 1 and |C2| < 1,
vz ¯z − |hJ1Fz, J2Fzi|
• If |C1| > 1 and |C2| > 1 and λC1C2 > 0, where λ ∈ {−1, 1}, then
vz ¯z − λ|hJ1Fz, J2Fzi|

sinh 2v = 0, wz ¯z − λ|hJ1Fz, J2Fzi|

sinh 2v = 0, wz ¯z − |hJ1Fz, J2Fzi|

4

sinh 2w = 0,

sinh 2w = 0.

(3) If p = 1 and the induced metric F ∗G is Riemannian, there exist smooth func-
tions v, w : Σ → R satisfying:
vz ¯z + |hJ1Fz, J2Fzi|

sin 2v = 0, wz ¯z − |hJ1Fz, J2Fzi|

sin 2w = 0.

4

4

(4) If p ∈ {0, 2} and the induced metric F ∗G is Lorentzian, there exist smooth
functions v, w : Σ → R satisfying:

vz ¯z − |hJ1Fz, J2Fzi|

4

sin 2v = 0, wz ¯z + |hJ1Fz, J2Fzi|

sin 2w = 0.

4

Proof. (1) Assume that F is a Riemannian immersion, that is ǫ = 1, of a minimal
surface in S2 × S2 or H2 × H2. The normal vector ﬁeld N satisﬁes |N|2 = −1, and
thus the constant function b is equal to 1. Since |γj| ≥ 0, from (2.12), we conclude
that the K¨ahler functions C1, C2 satisfy:

(2.23)

C 2
1 ≥ 1,

and

C 2
2 ≥ 1.

Using (2.14), we have the following equations

∆ log |Cj − 1| = aj + Cj ′ ,

∆ log |Cj + 1| = aj − Cj ′ ,

where

Deﬁne the real functions v, w by

aj = K + (−1)j+1K ⊥.

13

2v = logs|C1 + 1||C2 + 1|
|C1 − 1||C2 − 1|

,

2w = logs|C1 − 1||C2 + 1|
|C1 + 1||C2 − 1|

.

(2.24)

Therefore,

(2.25)

C1 = coth(v − w),

C2 = coth(v + w).

We also have the following relations
coth(v − w) + coth(v + w)

,

2

∆v = −

∆w = −
From (2.25), observe that Cj > 0 iﬀ v + (−1)jw > 0.
• We ﬁrst consider the case C1C2 > 0 and assume that Cj > 1 for j = 1, 2. From
hJ1Fz, J2Fzi = −γ1γ2, we see

2

coth(v − w) − coth(v + w)

.

|hJ1Fz, J2Fzi|2 =

e4u(C 2

1 − 1)(C 2

2 − 1)

.

4

Since C1C2 > 0, we have that sinh(v − w) sinh(v + w) > 0. In particular,

Thus,

(2.26)
The fact that ∆f = 4e−2ufz ¯z together with (2.27) implies that v and w both satisfy
the equations

vz ¯z + |hJ1Fz, J2Fzi|

4

sinh 2v = 0,

wz ¯z + |hJ1Fz, J2Fzi|

4

sinh 2w = 0.

• Consider now the case C1C2 < 0. In this case, the computations are identical
with the part of C1C2 > 0, except that

(2.27)

e2u = −2|hJ1Fz, J2Fzi| sinh(v − w) sinh(v + w).

Therefore, the functions v and w satisfy the equations

vz ¯z − |hJ1Fz, J2Fzi|

4

sinh 2v = 0,

wz ¯z − |hJ1Fz, J2Fzi|

4

sinh 2w = 0.

(2) Assume that F is a Lorentzian immersion (ǫ = −1) of a minimal surface in
S2
1 × S2
j 6= 1. Using (2.14),
we have the following relations

1. Working away of paracomplex points, we have that C 2

∆ log |Cj − 1| = −aj + Cj ′ ,

∆ log |Cj + 1| = −aj − Cj ′ .

Deﬁning v and w by (2.24), then Cj = coth(v + (−1)jw), if |Cj| > 1 and Cj =
tanh(v + (−1)jw), if |Cj| < 1. Observe again that, v + (−1)jw > 0 iﬀ Cj > 0.
• Let |Cj| < 1 for j = 1, 2. Here,

cosh(v + w) =

cosh(v − w) =

,

∆w = −

tanh(v − w) − tanh(v + w)

2

.

We also have

and thus,

|hJ1Fz, J2Fzi|2 =

e4u(1 − C 2
1 )(1 − C 2
2 )
4

.

The fact that ∆f = −4e−2ufz ¯z yields,
sinh 2v = 0,

e2u = 2|hJ1Fz, J2Fzi| · cosh(v − w) · cosh(v + w),
wz ¯z − |hJ1Fz, J2Fzi|

vz ¯z − |hJ1Fz, J2Fzi|

4

sinh 2w = 0.

• Let |Cj| > 1 for j = 1, 2. If the functions v, w are deﬁned by (2.24), then

C1 = coth(v − w),

C2 = coth(v + w),

and

∆v = −

coth(v − w) + coth(v + w)

2

,

∆w = −

coth(v − w) − coth(v + w)

2

.

If C1C2 > 0 (iﬀ v2 − w2 > 0), then sinh(v − w) sinh(v + w) > 0 and thus,

e2u = 2|hJ1Fz, J2Fzi| · sinh(v − w) · sinh(v + w).

A brief computation gives,

vz ¯z − |hJ1Fz, J2Fzi|

4

sinh 2v = 0,

wz ¯z − |hJ1Fz, J2Fzi|

4

sinh 2w = 0.

If now C1C2 < 0 (iﬀ v2 − w2 < 0), we have sinh(v − w) sinh(v + w) < 0 and thus,

e2u = −2|hJ1Fz, J2Fzi| · sinh(v − w) · sinh(v + w).

Thus,

vz ¯z + |hJ1Fz, J2Fzi|

4

sinh 2v = 0,

wz ¯z + |hJ1Fz, J2Fzi|

4

sinh 2w = 0.

(3) Assume that F is a Riemannian immersion (ǫ = 1) of a minimal surface in
S2
1 × S2

1. Using (2.14), we have the following relations

∆ tan−1 Cj = −Cj ′ .

Deﬁne the following functions:

v =

1
2

(tan−1 C1 + tan−1 C2), w =

1
2

(tan−1 C1 − tan−1 C2).

Then, C1 = tan(v + w) and C2 = tan(v − w) and thus,
cos2(v − w) =

cos2(v + w) =

1

1 + C 2
1

,

1

1 + C 2
2

.

Since v + w = tan−1 C1 and v − w = tan−1 C2 we have |v + w| < π/2 and |v − w| <
π/2. Thus, cos(v + w) > 0 and cos(v − w) > 0. Therefore,

The expression,

cos(v + w) =

In addition,

∆v = −

,

∆w =

and using the fact that ∆f = 4e−2ufz ¯z we ﬁnally obtain,

sin 2w = 0.

(4) Assume that F is a Lorentzian immersion (ǫ = −1) of a minimal surface in
S2 × S2 or H2 × H2. We deﬁne the functions u, v as for the case (3) and following
the same argument and using the fact that ∆f = 4e−2ufz ¯z we ﬁnd,

functions on Γ = {z ∈ C| v2(z, ¯z) − w2(z, ¯z) > 0}:

Cj = coth(v + (−1)jw),

octuple (u, A, Cj , γj, fj) satisfy the compatibility equations (2.9), (2.10) and (2.11)
for ǫ = b = 1 and p ∈ {0, 2} for A given by

A =

∂

∂z  logs sinh(v + w)
sinh(v − w)! .

Note that the complex function also satisﬁes (2.8). Thus, from Proposition 7, the
septuple (u, Cj, γj, fj) is the fundamental data of a unique Riemannian minimal
immersion Ft : Γ → S2
p with p ∈ {0, 2}. Moreover, for each t ∈ R, the
immersion Ft is non-Lagrangian without complex points.

p × S2

The cases (A.2), (B.1) , (B.2) and (B.3) are similar to (A.1).

(C.1.) Let v, w be solutions of (2.30). For j = 1, 2, we deﬁne the following functions
on Γ = {z ∈ C| |v − w| < π/2, |v + w| < π/2}:

Cj = tan(v + (−1)j+1w),

A =

∂

∂z  logs cos(v − w)
cos(v + w)! ,

which a brief computation shows that satisﬁes (2.8). Thus, from Proposition 7, the
septuple (u, Cj, γj, fj) is the fundamental data of a unique Riemannian minimal
immersion Ft : Γ → S2
1. Furthermore, for each t ∈ R, the immersion Ft is
non-Lagrangian without complex points.

Following a similar argument with the case (C.1), we prove (C.2).

2.4. Compact surfaces. By a compact surface we mean that the surface is closed,
oriented and connected. For a G-minimal immersion of a compact surface in S2× S2
or H2 × H2, we have the following theorem:
Theorem 4. Let Σ be a compact two-manifold, G-minimally immersed in S2
p × S2
p,
with p ∈ {0, 2}.
(1) If the induced metric is Riemannian, then Σ is a complex curve. In particular,
Σ is a topological type of a sphere.
(2) If the induced metric is Lorentzian then for every j = 1, 2, there exists a Ωj-
Lagrangian curve.
Proof. (1) Let F : Σ → S2
p be a G-minimal immersion such that F ∗G is
Riemannian. As we have seen in the proof of Proposition 11, when p ∈ {0, 2} the
K¨ahler functions C1, C2 satisfy (2.23). The expressions (2.14) and (2.15) become

p × S2

(2.31)

(2.32)

j − 1)(cid:16)K + (−1)j+1K ⊥ − C1C2(cid:17),
|∇Cj|2 = (C 2
∆Cj = 2Cj(cid:16)K + (−1)j+1K ⊥(cid:17) − Cj ′ (1 + C 2

j ).

We ﬁrst prove the existence of a Jj complex point, for every j = 1, 2. Assume that
Σ has no Jj complex points, for some j = 1, 2. Then C 2
j (x) > 1, for every x ∈ Σ.
Let M be a maximum point of Cj and assume that M is not Jj-complex. Since M
is a critical point of Cj, from (2.31) we have that

(2.33)
On the other hand, we have that ∆Cj (M ) ≤ 0 and, using (2.32) and (2.36), we
obtain the following inequality:

K(M ) + (−1)j+1K ⊥(M ) = C1(M )C2(M ).

Cj ′ (M )(C 2

j (M ) − 1) ≤ 0.

By the assumption that M is a non-Jj-complex point, we have that C 2
j (M ) > 1
and thus, Cj ′ (M ) ≤ 0. The fact that Σ is connected implies that Cj ′ (x) ≤ −1 for
all x ∈ Σ.

Let m be the minimum point of Cj. Then, (2.31) gives

(2.34)
Using the fact that ∆Cj(m) ≥ 0, the equations (2.32) and (2.34) give

K(m) + (−1)j+1K ⊥(m) = C1(m)C2(m).

Cj ′ (m)(C 2

j (m) − 1) ≥ 0,

which implies that Cj ′ (m) ≥ 0 and therefore we have a contradiction.

We now prove that Σ is a topological type of a sphere.
If F is a complex curve with respect to both complex structures then Σ must
have the same genus as S2
p. Then for p = 0, the compact surface Σ is a topological
type of a sphere. Note that for the case p = 2 no such immersion exists, since the
hyperbolic plane H2 is non-compact.

Assume now that F is a non-complex curve with respect to Jj (then it must have
isolated Jj-complex points) and suppose that p ∈ Σ is a critical point of Cj . If y is
a complex point, then C 2
j (y) = 1, and thus y is a local maximum or minimum of

18

Cj (because C 2
critical, non-Jj-complex point, from (2.31) we get

j (x) ≥ 1, for every x ∈ Σ and Σ is connected). Assuming that y is a

(2.35)

K(y) + (−1)j+1K ⊥(y) = C1(y)C2(y).

Substituting (2.35) into (2.32), we have

∆Cj(y) = 2Cj ′ (y)(C 2

j (y) − 1),

which is non-zero and thus, y is a local maximum or minimum. Then every critical
point is either local minimum or local maximum and using Morse’s Theorem, we
conclude that Σ is a topological type of a sphere.

We now prove that F must be a complex curve. Consider the Hopf diﬀerential

Θ associated to the immersion F given by,

Θ(z) =

1
2 hJ1Fz, J2Fzi dz ⊗ dz,

where z is the conformal parameter. From (2.2), we see that hJ1Fz, J2Fzi = −γ1γ2
and using (2.11), we see that Θ is holomorphic. Because Σ is a sphere, it follows
from Riemann-Roch’s Theorem that Θ is must be indentically zero throughout Σ
and thus γ1γ2 = 0 which means that F must be a complex curve.

(2) In this case, the expressions (2.14) and (2.15) become

(2.36)

(2.37)

Then,

j + 1)(cid:16)K + b(−1)jK ⊥ − C1C2(cid:17),
|∇Cj|2 = −(C 2
∆Cj = −2Cj(cid:16)K + b(−1)jK ⊥(cid:17) − Cj ′ (1 − C 2

∆ tan−1 Cj =

(C 2

and using (2.36) with (2.37), we obtain

Hence,

∆ tan−1 Cj = −Cj ′ .
C1 =ZΣ
ZΣ

C2 = 0,

and thus C1 and C2 must vanishes at least in curves on Σ.
Corollary 1. Every compact G-minimal surface in S2 × S2 or in H2 × H2 is either
a topological type of a sphere or a torus.

(cid:3)

For the case of dS2 × dS2, we obtain the following:

Theorem 5. Every compact G-minimal surface Σ in dS2 × dS2 is a topological
type of a torus. If furthermore, the metric G induced on Σ is Riemannian then for
every j = 1, 2, there exists a Ωj-Lagrangian point.

Proof. Clearly Σ is a tori when the induced metric is Lorentzian. Assume that the
induced metric is Riemannian. Let m and M be the minimum and the maximum
point of Cj , respectively. Then, substituting ǫ = p = 1 into (2.14) and (2.15) and
using the fact that m is a minimum point of Cj we get aj(m) = −C1(m)C2(m)
and Cj ′ (m) ≥ 0. Following a similar argument for the point M , we obtain that
Cj ′ (M ) ≤ 0. Since Σ is connected, there exists x ∈ Σ such that Cj ′ (x) = 0. We

now prove that Σ is a topological type of a torus. We again consider the Hopf
diﬀerential Θ associated to the immersion F which is holomorphic. On the other
hand, Θ is non-vanishing on Σ since,

19

|hJ1Fz, J2Fzi|2 = |γ1|2|γ2|2 = e4u(C 2

1 + 1)(C 2

2 + 1)/4,

and thus the genus is one.

(cid:3)

Finally, the following Theorem gives a rigidity result for the function K ± K ⊥

for compact minimal Riemannian surfaces in dS2 × dS2.
Theorem 6. Let F : Σ → dS2 × dS2 be a G-minimal immersion of a compact
surface Σ such that the induced metric is Riemmanian. For m ∈ {1, 2} assume
that we have K + (−1)mK ⊥ ≥ 0 or K + (−1)mK ⊥ ≤ 0. Then, K = K ⊥ = 0 and
F is locally the product of geodesics in dS2.
Proof. Consider a G-minimal immersion F : Σ → dS2 × dS2 such that the surface
Σ is compact and the induced metric F ∗G is Riemannian. In this case, we have

(2.38)

and,

(2.39)

|∇Cm′|2 = (C 2

m′ + 1)(K + (−1)mK ⊥ + C1C2),

∆Cm′ = 2Cm′ (K + (−1)mK ⊥) − Cm(1 − C 2

m′ ).

A brief computation gives

and thus,

∆ logq1 + C 2

m′ = K + (−1)mK ⊥,

ZΣ

K + (−1)mK ⊥ = 0.

Assuming, without loss of generality that K + (−1)mK ⊥ ≥ 0, we have
(2.40)

K + (−1)mK ⊥ = 0.

Using (2.40), the expressions (2.38) and (2.39) become

|∇Cm′|2 = (C 2

(2.41)
and since |∇Cm′|2 ≥ 0 we have C1C2 ≥ 0.

m′ + 1)C1C2,

The relations (2.41) yield

and ∆Cm′ = Cm(C 2

m′ − 1),

∆C 2

m′ = 4C1C2C 2

m′ ≥ 0.

Thus, C 2

m′ ∆C 2

m′ ≥ 0 and therefore, the K¨ahler function Cm′ is constant. Then,

and since

¯γm′ fm′ = 0,

|γm′|2 =

e2u(C 2
m′ + 1)
2

,

we have that fm′ = 0. Hence, ¯γm′Cm = 0, and thus Cm = 0. Then F is Lagrangian
and therefore it is the product of geodesics in dS2.
