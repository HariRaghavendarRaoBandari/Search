ABSTRACT

In this work we analyze constrained superﬁelds in supersymmetry and supergravity. We
propose a constraint that, in combination with the constrained goldstino multiplet, consistently
removes any selected component from a generic superﬁeld. We also describe its origin, providing
the operators whose equations of motion lead to the decoupling of such components. We illustrate
our proposal by means of various examples and show how known constraints can be reproduced
by our method.

1 Introduction
At energy scales well below the scale of supersymmetry breaking √f supersymmetry is nonlin-
early realized [1]. While initially geometric methods were used for writing down the correspond-
ing lagrangians [1, 2], it became clear soon that one could still eﬃciently employ superspace
techniques if constrained superﬁelds were introduced [3, 4, 5]. Such superﬁelds impose the de-
coupling of heavy states below the scale of supersymmetry breaking and implement nonlinear
supersymmetry of eﬀective low-energy actions in a novel way with respect to the more familiar
introduction of explicit soft-breaking terms in lagrangians for the minimal supersymmetric stan-
dard model (MSSM). Used in a few works to deﬁne manifestly supersymmetric generalizations
of MSSM [6], they became more recently widely used in cosmology [7]–[11] (for a recent review,
see [12]). This also revived a comprehensive study of constrained superﬁelds in supergravity
theories [9], [10], [13]-[19], which are the natural framework for building inﬂationary scenarios.
Even if we are mainly interested in models with constrained superﬁelds to build eﬀective
theories, it is desirable to understand their origin from an ultraviolet (UV) perspective. First
of all, it would single out stable microscopic frameworks, versus unstable ones, like models
containing ghosts. Secondly, it would help clarifying the needed dynamics for removing the
massive particles from the low-energy spectrum. Finally, it would make clear the generality and
the naturalness of such constraints [20]. In this paper we address this issue in a ﬁeld-theoretical
framework. Although explicit string constructions based on tachyon-free non-BPS systems are
known since some time [21] and their non-linear supersymmetry has been studied in detail [22],
at present their connection with the constrained superﬁeld formalism is still unknown (for recent
progress on the string theory description of the nilpotent goldstino see [23]).

Our approach to generate the constraints is similar to the one used when passing from
the linear to the non-linear σ-model. The original UV lagrangians have standard (linearly
realized), spontaneously broken supersymmetry. Speciﬁc terms in the lagrangian generate large
mass splittings in certain multiplets after supersymmetry breaking. At energy well below these
masses, the (super)ﬁeld equations of motion are dominated by these terms, which turn equations
of motion into superﬁeld constraints. Each such operator eliminates one ﬁeld component. Several
such operators, with large coeﬃcients can eliminate several ﬁeld components. Often the resulting
multiple constraints can be combined into an equivalent single superﬁeld constraint. We give
several examples for chiral, vector and linear multiplets, with various components decoupled,
in rigid supersymmetry and supergravity. To simplify the discussion, we assume that there is
always a goldstino (chiral) multiplet, satisfying the standard polynomial constraint X 2 = 0.

In the simplest examples considered here, the UV actions are standard two-derivative super-
symmetry/supergravity ones. However, in some examples, the UV operators needed to generate
the desired constraints are of higher-derivative type, especially when considering constraints
on the auxiliary ﬁelds. This means that one should treat with care these models, because the
original UV theory may be sick.

So far, the many superﬁeld constraints that have been proposed seem to have no speciﬁc
organizing principle behind them, and one has to ﬁnd the appropriate constraint by a trial and
error procedure. In this work we ﬁll this gap and provide a simple organizing principle: when
the supersymmetry breaking sector has a goldstino superﬁeld satisfying

X 2 = 0,

any constraint on another superﬁeld Q originates from

XX Q = 0.

This constraint removes the lowest component of Q and is enough to explain the origin and the
properties of all the known constraints in the literature, opening at the same time the way for
many new possibilities.

2 General constrained superﬁelds and their origin

When supersymmetry is broken and non-linearly realized, it is known that one may remove
various component ﬁelds from the spectrum by imposing supersymmetric constraints. Even
though various examples are known, a systematic method to generate new constraints, and to
reproduce all known ones as speciﬁc cases, is still lacking. In this section we aim to ﬁll exactly
this gap: we present a single superspace constraint which, when imposed on a superﬁeld, will
remove from the spectrum its lowest component ﬁeld. Moreover, imposing various constraints
on the same superﬁeld will result in removing additional component ﬁelds and may be equivalent
to diﬀerent known constraints. The structure of this generic constraint depends crucially on the
properties of the supersymmetry breaking sector, which we shall review brieﬂy.

2

The breaking of a global symmetry implies the existence of a massless goldstone mode. For
supersymmetry this is the goldstino. In the simplest setup, the goldstino belongs to a chiral
multiplet and has a scalar superpartner (the sgoldstino), which, once supersymmetry is broken,
acquires a non-supersymmetric mass. Decoupling the sgoldstino by giving it an inﬁnite mass
leads to a non-linear realization of supersymmetry. In particular, the non-linear realization is
induced by imposing on the SUSY-breaking chiral superﬁeld X the constraint [3, 4, 5, 24]

X 2 = 0.

(1)

Whenever supersymmetry is broken by means of a non-trivial F -term F 6= 0, this constraint is
solved by

X =

G2
2F

+ √2θG + θ2F.

(2)

Actually, consistency does not require the existence of a decoupled massive scalar and therefore
(1) may be used more generally. For instance, there are examples where this constraint does
not appear as the infrared limit of the supersymmetry breaking sector [20], in case of generic
couplings of X to other decoupled scalar ﬁelds. However, under speciﬁc assumptions on the
UV theory, the constraint (1) will generically hold. In particular it will hold for a very heavy
sgoldstino with small mass mixing to other ﬁelds.

In this work we will always assume that (1) is imposed on X, without further assumptions

about the supersymmetry breaking sector, which will be described by the lagrangian

LX =Z d4θXX +(cid:26)fZ d2θX + c.c.(cid:27) .

(3)

We can then construct generic eﬀective theories when more heavy states have been integrated
out by imposing constraints that remove the lowest component from a superﬁeld QL, where the
subscript “L” stands for a generic index labeling the Lorentz representation of the superﬁeld1.
This can be done by imposing

XX QL = 0.

(4)

To remove more components from the same or from diﬀerent supermultiplets, one has to impose
several such constraints. As we will see, in most cases the constraint (4) can be understood as
the decoupling of the speciﬁc component ﬁeld, following from the introduction of a very large
non-supersymmetric mass.

A method to solve (4) is to act on it with various combinations of the superspace derivatives
Dα and D ˙α and project the result to θ = θ = 0. This leads to various relations between the
component ﬁelds of the superﬁeld QL and the component ﬁelds of the supersymmetry breaking

1If the representation of the ﬁeld QL under the Lorentz group derives from the action of derivatives, one

should be careful and check also the integrability of the solution to the constraint.

sector. In fact the other conditions serve as consistency checks to the complete solution which is
found by acting on (4) with the maximum number of superspace derivatives, namely by taking

D2D

2(cid:0)XXQL(cid:1)| = 0,

(5)

where the bar denotes the projection to θ = θ = 0. In other words, when imposing the constraint
(4) one simply has to solve (5) by expressing the component ﬁeld QL| in terms of the other
component ﬁelds in the theory:

QL = −2

(6)

Once projected at θ = θ = 0, we get an expression for the component QL| and all other condi-
tions, which arise from (4) by acting with diﬀerent combinations of Dα and D ˙α are identically
satisﬁed.

In principle the component ﬁelds which reside in an unconstrained superﬁeld give a reducible
representation of the supersymmetry algebra, therefore we impose supersymmetric conditions to
reduce the component content to an irreducible representation (for example a chiral superﬁeld
has D ˙αΦ = 0). It is easy to see that the supersymmetric conditions used to deﬁne the various
superﬁelds are respected by the constraint (4). As we show in the appendix, if we had acted
on (6) with D ˙γ without projecting to components we would ﬁnd the identity D ˙γQL = D ˙γQL.
Similarly, if we had acted with Dγ we would ﬁnd DγQL = DγQL. Clearly this property of the
constraint will hold also when we act with more Dα or D ˙α and guarantees that the supersym-
metric conditions on the superﬁeld are not altered by the constraint. In particular it implies
that the component ﬁelds all satisfy the same conditions as they did before we imposed the
constraint (4). This is diﬀerent from what happens for constraints that remove more than one
component at once.

Now let us discuss the UV origin of the constraint (4). Assuming that (1) holds, the constraint
(4) can be understood as the decoupling of the component ﬁeld QL|, by taking some formal limit.
We can illustrate this by a scenario where the supersymmetry breaking sector is appropriately
coupled to the superﬁeld QL, such that the component QL| gets a non-supersymmetric mass.
The total Lagrangian will have either the form

L = LX,QL −

or the form

depending on the properties of the superﬁeld QL, and LX,QL stands for some supersymmetric
Lagrangian containing the constrained superﬁeld X and QL. In the limit

mQL → ∞

(9)

QL| decouples because it gets an inﬁnite mass. The superspace equations of motion for the
superﬁeld QL will have a ﬁnite part but also a part which diverges. Due to the structure of the
terms in (7) (or (8)) which give rise to the non-supersymmetric mass, the divergent part of the
equations of motion will always identically vanish once we impose (4)

XXQL = 0

(10)

and viceversa, by requiring the divergent part to vanish, we will deduce the constraint (4). We
will illustrate this with various examples in the next section.

Let us end this general part with a comparison with the original approach in obtaining
constrained multiplets. It was originally believed [5] that the constraints are unique and inde-
pendent on the UV details, in particular on the masses of the decoupled supertpartners and
more generally on the coeﬃcients of the UV operators needed in the decoupling procedure. This
would have indeed been desirable, because it would have implied the UV independence of the
resulting constraints, like in the case of the Volkov–Akulov ﬁeld alone. However, it was later
realized [20] that in the more general case where, in addition to the sgoldstino, superpartners
in other multiplets are decoupled, the resulting constraints were generally modiﬁed. For this
reason, here we take the simpler limit of inﬁnite mass/coeﬃcient for some operators. This should
be a valid procedure in string theory examples [21, 22, 23], where superpartners are just absent
from the ﬁeld-theory spectrum. From a ﬁeld theory point of view it does imply speciﬁc UV
assumptions on the dynamics, see e.g. [20], [25].

3 General constrained superﬁelds in global supersymmetry

3.1 Constrained chiral superﬁelds

In this section we apply our general technique to constrained chiral superﬁelds. We start by
considering models where a single component is removed from the spectrum and then move
to more complicated examples involving multiple components. We start by noting that the
standard chiral constraint removing the scalar component from the chiral superﬁeld Y , namely
XY = 0 [26], is equivalent to the condition (4) introduced earlier:

This is easily understood by recalling that the chiral superﬁeld D
in the supersymmetry breaking sector we have

2

X is nowhere vanishing because

XX Y = 0.

(11)

F = −

D

X| = −f + ··· .

(12)

2 on (11) gives a constraint equivalent to XY = 0 upon
This means that the action of D
X)−1. Following the general procedure detailed in the previous section,
multiplication with (D
the constraint (11) follows from a lagrangian containing the constrained goldstino multiplet, the
Y multiplet, and the coupling

2

(13)

−

m2
y

f 2 Z d4θ |X|2|Y |2,

5

which gives a non-supersymmetric mass to the lowest scalar component of Y . In the limit my →
∞, the scalar is completely removed from the spectrum, leading to a constrained superﬁeld.
Indeed, in this limit, the superspace equations of motion for Y have a my dependent part which
will diverge. Requiring the my part to be identically vanishing yields

2

D

(|X|2 Y ) = 0,

(14)

which is equivalent to (11).

Another simple example is the decoupling of the fermion component ﬁeld of Y . The term

which generates the non-supersymmetric mass for √2 χα ≡ DαY | has the form

−

mχ

2f 2 Z d4θh|X|2DαY DαY + c.c.i

and the divergent part of the superspace equations of motion in the limit mχ → ∞ is

This is easily proved to be equivalent to

D

2(cid:8)Dα(|X|2DαY )(cid:9) = 0.

|X|2DαY = 0,

(15)

(16)

(17)

by acting on (16) with XDβX and using the fact that |D2X|2 6= 0. This constraint has been
ﬁrst proposed in [17] to consistently remove the fermion ﬁeld in Y , while preserving a non-trivial
F -term, which allows consistent general couplings to the rest of the matter multiplets2. This
diﬀers from the constraint

Dα(X H) = 0,

(18)

which was proposed in [5] and removes both the fermion and the auxiliary component ﬁelds of
the chiral superﬁeld H. Actually, we can prove that it is equivalent to imposing simultaneously
two constraints of the form (4). First, if we multiply (18) by X we recover

|X|2DαH = 0,

which removes the fermion in H. Then, if we multiply (18) with XDα we obtain

|X|2D2H = 0,

(19)

(20)

which removes the auxiliary ﬁeld. We can actually do more and prove that these two are also
equivalent to (18). In fact, by acting on (19) with D2 we get

(D2X)XDαH − XDαXD2H = 0,

(21)

2The operator (15) was proposed in Appendix C of [20]. From our current discussion it is clear that in the
inﬁnite mass limit it leads to the constraint (17) and not to the KS constraint (18). This explains the puzzle
mentioned there; the auxiliary ﬁeld is indeed not removed. The existence of two diﬀerent constraints removing
the fermion from a chiral multiplet adds evidence to the non-uniqueness of the constrained superﬁelds, even in
the inﬁnite mass limit.

6

and the second term is vanishing because of (20), leaving us with the ﬁrst term, which is
equivalent to (18). We now have a simple way to obtain (18) from a lagrangian where only the
goldstino multiplet is constrained. We need to introduce large interaction terms of the form

−

mh

2f 2 Z d4θh|X|2DαHDαH + c.c.i −

gF H

f 2 Z d4θh|X|2D2HD

2

Hi.

(22)

Note that if the chiral superﬁeld X was not nilpotent, the last term in (22) proportional to
gF H could introduce ghosts into the theory. This is a non-trivial property of the decoupling
procedure, and signal that such constraints could (but not necessarily) come from a sick UV
theory. We are interested once more in the dominant part of the H superspace equations of
motion, in the limit of large mH/f 2 and gF H /f 2 couplings. This is

D

2(cid:26) mh

f 2 Dα(|X|2DαH) −

gF H
f 2 D2(|X|2D

2

H)(cid:27) = 0,

which, multiplied by XX, produces

which is equivalent to (20), and acted upon by DβXX and using (20) gives

|X|2|D2X|2D

2

H = 0,

|X|2|D2X|2DβH = 0,

(23)

(24)

(25)

which implies (19).

It is interesting here to pause for a second and discuss an alternative way to impose a
constraint on the F -term. It is in fact clear that, in our setup, |X|2D2H = 0 is equivalent to
the antichiral constraint

X D2H = 0.

A suitable term that produces this constraint in the large mass limit is

−

mh

2f 2 Z d4θ XDαHDαH + c.c..

The relevant part of the H equations of motion gives

which is equivalent to

and, by multiplying with X, to

2

D

Dα(XDαH) = 0,

2

D

(XD2H) = 0

X D2H = 0.

(26)

(27)

(28)

(29)

(30)

We will see in the next section that in the locally supersymmetric case one has to be careful in
implementing the two options and in fact in some cases we are forced to choose the ﬁrst over
the second.

7

As a ﬁnal example we study the constraint on the chiral superﬁeld A that removes the

imaginary part of the scalar, the fermion and the auxiliary ﬁeld [5]:

It is a straightforward exercise to prove that (31) is equivalent to the following set of constraints

X(A − A) = 0.

(31)

|X|2(A − A) = 0,
|X|2D ˙αA = 0,
|X|2D
A = 0.

2

(32)

(33)

(34)

This means that we can generate the constraint (31) by means of three terms in the lagrangian,
which generate non-supersymmetric masses for the component ﬁelds we remove:

Z d4θh m2

b

2f 2|X|2(A − A)2 −

gF A
f 2 |X|2D2AD

2

Ai −

mζ

2f 2 Z d4θh|X|2DαADαA + c.c.i.

(35)

In the limit mb → ∞, gF A → ∞ and mζ → ∞, the superspace equations of motion for the chiral
superﬁeld A are dominated by

D

2(cid:26) m2

b

f 2 |X|2(A − A) +

mζ
f 2 Dα(|X|2DαA) −

gF A
f 2 D2(|X|2D

2

A)(cid:27) = 0.

(36)

This reproduces the constraint (31) by looking at diﬀerent projections: multiplication with XX
gives (34); the action with DβXX gives (33); ﬁnally, using (33) and (34) in (36) and then
multiplying with X gives (32).

3.2 Constrained vector multiplets

It is well known that in a theory with a vector multiplet coupled to the nilpotent goldstino
superﬁeld, a simple way to remove the gaugino λα = −iWα| from the spectrum is to impose [5]
(37)

XWα = 0.

Clearly, such constraint is equivalent to

XX Wα = 0.

(38)

This form of the constraint can be generated by following our general procedure, introducing a
large term of the form

The ﬁeld equations deriving from such term give

−

mλ

2f (cid:18)Z d2θ X W αWα + c.c.(cid:19) .

Dα(X Wα) + D ˙α(X W

˙α

) = 0 ,

8

(39)

(40)

which, projected with XXDβ, give

XXWα = 0.

(41)

We therefore see that (37) corresponds to the decoupling of the gaugino, due to its large mass.
We could also consider other models where more components are removed from the spectrum

by constraints of the form (4). For instance, in the theory for a massive vector superﬁeld

L =

m2

4 Z d4θ(V − Φ − Φ)2 +

1

4g2 (cid:18)Z d2θ W 2 + c.c.(cid:19) ,

(42)

gauge invariance is maintained if Φ → Φ + S together with V → V + S + S. This is a
supersymmetric version of the Stueckelberg mechanism. Of course we may gauge ﬁx Φ = 0, but
then V should not be written in the Wess-Zumino gauge. The component ﬁeld spectrum of the
Lagrangian (42) comprises a massive vector, a massive real scalar, two massive fermions with
Dirac mass, a complex scalar auxiliary ﬁeld, and a real scalar auxiliary ﬁeld. All propagating
ﬁelds have the same mass. The superspace constraint which removes the massive vector from
the spectrum is

XX[Dα, D ˙α](V − Φ − Φ) = 0

and the term which gives a non-supersymmetric mass to the massive vector is

m2
v

16f 2 Z d4θXX[Dα, D ˙α](V − Φ − Φ)[Dα, D

˙α

](V − Φ − Φ).

3.3 Constrained real linear superﬁelds

(43)

(44)

We conclude this section by analyzing constrained real linear superﬁelds. In this case we will give
more details on the constraints and on their solutions, because they have not appeared previously
in the literature. A real linear superﬁeld is deﬁned by a real multiplet L = L∗ satisfying

D2L = 0 = D

L.

Its component ﬁelds are

φ = L|,

[Dα, D ˙α]L|.

√2χα = DαL|,

(45)

(46)

Note that Hm satisﬁes the constraint ∂mHm = 0, which means that it is eﬀectively the ﬁeld
strength of a real two-form

Hm = ǫmnkl∂nBkl.

(47)

We now present various constraints of the form (4), which remove some components of L.

To remove the real scalar we impose

which leads to the equation

A dynamical origin of the constraint (48) follows from the equations of motion generated by

(52)

which give a non-supersymmetric mass to φ once the auxiliary ﬁeld of the supersymmetry
breaking sector F is integrated out. When mφ is large, the scalar decouples and the constraint
(48) follows. Indeed we ﬁnd that, in the mφ → ∞ limit, the divergent term of the L superspace
equations of motion gives

which, after acting with XDβX, becomes (48).

To remove the fermion we can impose the constraint

2

D

Dα(|X|2L) = 0,

XXDαL = 0.

DαL is anti-chiral Dβ(DαL) = 0 and therefore the constraint simpliﬁes to

2

D

DβnDα(|X|2DαL) + D

˙α

(|X|2D ˙αL)o = 0,

(59)

which we multiply by |X|2 to deduce (54).

For the real two-form Bkl the situation changes because Bkl is a gauge ﬁeld, and therefore
it is protected by the gauge symmetry to be massless. If we insist on removing the two-form
from the spectrum we have to embed it ﬁrst in a massive real linear multiplet. We note that
the embedding into the massive real linear is essential not for the mass term it will give to the
two-form, but rather for the extra degrees of freedom the two-form will get via the Stueckelberg
mechanism by absorbing a U(1) vector. The real linear multiplet can be written with the help
of a chiral prepotential (D ˙β τα = 0) as

so that the superﬁeld τα has a gauge invariance

L = Dατα + D ˙ατ ˙α,

τα → τα + i Wα,

(60)

(61)

where the chiral superﬁeld Wα is a vector ﬁeld-strength superﬁeld and D(ατβ) contains the
2-form Bmn. The manifest gauge invariant Lagrangian for the massive real linear multiplet is

L = −Z d4θL2 −

m2
L

2 (cid:18)Z d2θ(τ α − i ˜W α)(τα − i ˜Wα) + c.c.(cid:19) ,

where we have introduced a chiral superﬁeld

(62)

(63)

and the gauge superﬁeld transforms as ˜V → ˜V + V .
In what follows we choose the gauge
˜V = 0 to keep the formulas simple. To remove the two-form from the spectrum we impose the
constraint

The term which will give the large mass to the two-form is

XX (Dατβ + Dβτα) = 0.

and once we multiply with XDγX we deduce (64) (always keeping in mind that D2X is invert-

4 General constrained superﬁelds in supergravity

Constrained superﬁelds in supergravity have been discussed by various authors [3, 14, 7, 9]–[19],
mainly reproducing the ones introduced in global supersymmetry. Once more, our approach
allows to consistently couple constrained superﬁelds to supergravity via the introduction of the
same general constraint as in global supersymmetry

XX QL = 0,

(67)

provided we have a nilpotent goldstino superﬁeld X in our model. This includes all known
examples and paves the way for many new possibilities.

Also in this case, this constraint can be recovered in supergravity by adding large non-
supersymmetric mass contributions for the component we wish to remove. This can be obtained
once more by adding terms of the form

L =

or

L

mQ2

16f 2 (cid:20)Z d2Θ 2E (D

(68)

(69)

depending on the properties of QL. Actually, if QL is a chiral superﬁeld, one may equivalently
QL|X|2|QL|2 to the Kähler potential, which give a large mass to QL|.
add terms of the form m2
When we take the formal limit mQL → ∞ and require the divergent part of the superspace
equations of motion to be vanishing, we see that the constraint they imply is identically satisﬁed
once we impose (67). The applications this constraint can have are numerous, and we shall not
discuss them here, but we will discuss various interesting examples containing chiral superﬁelds.

12

4.1 Constraints on chiral superﬁelds: removing physical ﬁelds

The ﬁrst example we wish to discuss is the elimination of the lowest complex scalar component y
from the chiral superﬁeld Y . It is known that the constraint XY = 0 can be consistently solved
also in supergravity [16, 17] and eliminates y. As in global supersymmetry, by multiplying it
with X we get

Viceversa, assuming that (70) holds, we can multiply it with X D

2, which gives

XXY = 0.

2

XX D

X Y = 0,

(70)

(71)

which is also equivalent to the previous one whenever supersymmetry is broken by the X super-
ﬁeld.

To illustrate the origin of this constraint, we start from a supergravity theory coupled to X

and Y via a Kähler potential

K = XX + Y Y −

m2
y
f 2 |Y |2|X|2

(72)

and a superpotential containing a non-trivial F -term for X. The superspace equations of motion
for the chiral multiplet Y are

2

(D

− 8R)e−K/3KY = 0.

(73)

Now to decouple the scalar y, we take the formal limit my → ∞, and require the terms which
diverge to be vanishing. This yields the constraint

2

(D

− 8R)(e−Y Y /3(|X|2Y − |X|2Y Y

3

2

)) = 0.

We multiply with X to ﬁnd

e−Y Y /3|X|2Y (cid:18)1 −

Y Y

3 (cid:19) = 0

(74)

(75)

which is equivalent to (70), because we can multiply with eY Y /3
(cid:16)1− Y Y
3 (cid:17)

.

It is clear that, using a combination of constraints, one may remove from the spectrum of

the theory a real scalar and the fermion in a single chiral multiplet

B = b + ic + √2Θαχα + Θ2F B.

By imposing on B the following constraints

|X|2(B − B) =0 ,
|X|2 DαB =0 ,

13

(76)

(77)

one may remove the real scalar c and the fermion component of χα. To derive these constraints
as the decoupling of c and χα, we can consider a Kähler potential of the form

K = XXZ(B,B) + U (B,B) −

m2
c
2f 2|X|2|B − B|2 ,

together with a mediation term that gives a non-supersymmetric mass to the fermion

L =

mχ

16f 2 (cid:20)Z d2Θ 2E (D

2

− 8R)|X|2 DαB DαB(cid:21) + c.c.

(78)

(79)

and a superpotential containing a non-trivial F -term for X. The study of the divergent parts of
the superspace equations of motion in the limits

mc → ∞ , mχ → ∞ ,

(80)

leads to the constraints (77).

4.2 Constraints on chiral superﬁelds: removing auxiliary ﬁelds

Until now we have seen that supersymmetry and supergravity would give similar results. This
does not happen when we start to remove auxiliary ﬁelds from the spectrum. We now illustrate
this by considering a chiral superﬁeld Y and removing its auxiliary ﬁeld F y. As we have seen
in global supersymmetry, this can be achieved by the introduction of one of the two diﬀerent
mediation terms: the second term inside (22) or (27). The ﬁrst option in supergravity becomes

Laux2 =

gF y

8f 2 Z d2Θ 2E (D

2

Yi + c.c. .

The divergent part of the superspace equations of motion in the limit gF y → ∞ give

− 8R)h|X|2D2Y D

2

|X|2D2Y = 0 ,

(81)

(82)

which removes the auxiliary ﬁeld F y from the spectrum. Alternatively, we could use the medi-
ation term

Laux2 =

gF y

8f (cid:20)Z d2Θ 2E (D

2

− 8R)X D ˙αY D

˙α

Y(cid:21) + c.c.

which produces the constraint

2

XD

Y = 0.

(83)

(84)

Clearly (84) will give (82) once we multiply with X and therefore it removes the auxiliary ﬁeld
from the spectrum. However, in contrast to the global case, once we act with D ˙α on (84) we
ﬁnd a non-trivial result

X RD ˙αY = 0.

14

(85)

When supersymmetry is broken with vanishing vacuum energy, the lowest component of R
always has a non-vanishing value, which is proportional to the gravitino mass. Therefore, in this
setup one may consistently employ R−1 to ﬁnd

X D ˙αY = 0 ,

(86)

which removes also the fermion χα from the spectrum. This is an example of a constraint being
imposed indirectly via gravity mediation. Indeed, if we turn to the exact component form of
(83), we ﬁnd (in the gauge Gα = 0)

gF y

y

(87)

e−1Laux2 =

f (cid:2)F (F

)2 + M F χ2(cid:3) + c.c.

which shows that the fermion will get a mass when for the supergravity auxiliary ﬁeld M we
have hMi 6= 0.

5 Summary and prospects

In this work we have studied theories where the supersymmetry breaking sector is described
by the nilpotent superﬁeld X. We have shown that all known constraints on additional matter
and gauge superﬁelds are manifestations of a single generic constraint. We have also shown
that all known constraints plus some new ones we derive, can be understood microscopically as
arising from the decoupling of heavy states in the inﬁnite mass limit or, for the case of auxiliary
ﬁelds, in the inﬁnite coupling limit of appropriate operators. For rigid supersymmetry and in all
examples, for each component ﬁeld removed there is a corresponding operator in the UV. In the
case of supergravity, one operator can decouple several ﬁeld components simultaneously and we
gave an example where a single operator decouples simultaneously a fermion and an auxiliary
ﬁeld.

It would be interesting to understand under which conditions the formal limit of inﬁnite mass
and couplings is a good approximation of UV dynamics. From this perspective, our examples
are not really microscopic UV models leading to the superﬁeld constraints in the IR, but a
parametrization of needed operators with large coeﬃcients. We believe however that they are
a ﬁrst step in unravelling the required UV dynamics, by identifying the necessary ingredients
needed in ﬁnding truly microscopic models.

A Self-consistency of the constraint

In this appendix we prove that the constraint (4) removes no other component from the superﬁeld
QL, other than the lowest one. This is proved by showing that by acting with Dα or D ˙α on the
condition constraining the θ = ¯θ = 0 component of Q, we obtain identities, and therefore we do
not impose any further constraint on the higher components. From (4) we have
