Abstract. In this article we study the analytic classiﬁcation of certain types
of quasi-homogeneous cuspidal holomorphic foliations in (C3, 0) via the essen-
tial holonomy deﬁned over one of the components of the exceptional divisor
that appears in the reduction of the singularities of the foliation.

1. Introduction

The objective of this paper is to give a contribution to the analytical classiﬁcation
of germs of codimension one holomorphic foliations deﬁned on an ambient space
of dimension three. More generally, assume that the dimension of the ambient
space is arbitrary, call it n. Let F1, F2 be two such germs, generated by integrable
1-forms ω1, ω2, respectively, holomorphic in a neighbourhood of 0 ∈ Cn. We will
say that F1, F2 are analytically equivalent if there exists a germ of diﬀeomorphism
φ : (Cn, 0) → (Cn, 0) such that φ∗ω1 ∧ ω2 = 0.

Let us mention here some of the previous results concerning this subject. When
n = 2, J. Martinet and J.-P. Ramis [19, 20] consider simple (reduced) singularities,
both in the saddle-node case and in the resonant case. Concerning non-simple
singularities, consider the nilpotent case (i.e.
foliations deﬁned by a 1-form ω
such that its dual vector ﬁeld has nilpotent, non-zero, linear part), in which these
foliations admit a formal normal form d(y2 + xn) + xp.u(x)dy, where n ≥ 3, p ≥ 2
[32], and u(0) 6= 0, and in fact an analytic pre-normal form ω = d(y2 + xn) +
A(x, y)(nydx − 2xdy) (see [6]). These foliations have been the object of study of
R. Moussu [27], D. Cerveau [6], R. Meziani [24], M. Berthier, P. Sad [2] and E.
Str´o˙zyna [31]. It is worth to mention here other previous works that contribute
to the analytic classiﬁcation of holomorphic foliations, as the ones by J.-F. Mattei
[21, 22] and Y. Genzmer [12]. Other authors focus in the topological classiﬁcation,
that we will not treat in this paper. Among them, let us mention, without trying
to be exhaustive, works of D. Mar´ın and J.-F. Mattei [18], and of R. Rosas [30].

In dimension n = 3, simple singularities have been studied by D. Cerveau and
J. Mozo in [7]. Concerning non-simple singularities, P. Fern´andez and J. Mozo
studied in [8] the case of quasi-ordinary, cuspidal singularities. In these works, the

main tool used is, either the holonomy of one of the separatrices of the foliation or,
more frequently, the projective holonomy of a certain component of the exceptional
divisor that appears after the reduction of the singularities.
In order to apply
this technique, specially in dimension higher than two, it is of great importance to
study the topology of the divisor, as the holonomy group of each component is a
representation of its fundamental group.

In this paper, we will apply this technique to a kind of cuspidal foliations more
general than the quasi-ordinary ones studied in [8], more precisely, admissible quasi-
homogeneous foliation (see Deﬁnition 1 in Section 2) of generalized surface type.
Recall, from [9] and [10], that a germ F of non dicritical foliation in (C3, 0), gener-
ated by an integrable 1-form ω, is a generalized surface if every generically trans-
verse plane section ϕ : (C2, 0) → (C3, 0) (i.e., ϕ∗ω 6≡ 0) deﬁnes a generalized curve
in the sense of [3]. In particular, for generalized surfaces, once its set of separatrices
has been reduced, the foliation has only simple singularities, as shown in [9] and
generalized in [10] for higher dimensions.

In Section 2, a cuspidal foliation in (C3, 0) will be deﬁned as a generalized
surface F having a separatrix written as z2 + ϕ(x, y) = 0, in appropriate coor-
dinates. We will consider in this paper the situation in which the separatrix is
quasi-homogeneous. The ﬁrst point would be to ﬁnd an analytic normal form for
these type of foliations, in the style of the ones considered by D. Cerveau and R.
Moussu in dimension two. This is the main problem studied in [11]. In that pa-
per, it is shown that a cuspidal, quasi-homogeneous foliation F with a separatrix
z2 + ϕ(x, y) = 0, can be generated by an integrable 1-form

ω = d(z2 + ϕ) + G(Ψ, z) · z · Ψ ·(cid:18)2

dz
z

−

dϕ

ϕ (cid:19) ,

where Ψr = ϕ, Ψ is not a power, and G is a germ of holomorphic function in two
variables. This is the starting point of the present paper.

Also in Section 2, the main deﬁnitions of the paper are presented. We will work
with a concrete reduction of singularities of cuspidal quasi-homogeneous foliations,
obtained via the Weierstrass-Jung method. For the sake of completeness, this
reduction will be sketched in Section 3. In Section 4, the topology of the components
of the exceptional divisor is studied. As we said before, this is important in order to
identify the component of the exceptional divisor where the holonomy is computed.
In particular there is one component such that, once removed the singular locus, it
is homeomorphic to (C∗ × C) r C, where C is a certain algebraic plane curve, whose
topology will be interesting for us. The fundamental group will be computed in
this section.

In order to lift the holonomy of a component of the divisor, a ﬁbration transverse
to the foliation outside the separatrices, is constructed in Section 5. Finally, Sec-
tion 6, is devoted to study the main problem of the paper: to classify analytically
quasi-homogeneous generalized surfaces following this method. Unfortunately, the
answer is not complete, and we must impose some conditions (properties ℘1, ℘2
of Deﬁnition 5), that guarantee the linearization of the holonomy over some “end
component” of the divisor, that we will call special components. Under these con-
ditions, Theorem 6 of this section is the main result of the paper, and gives the
analytic classiﬁcation.

As a future work, we would like to study a wider class of foliations. The existing
works of Mattei and Genzmer [21, 22, 12] in dimension two lead us to think that
diﬀerent techniques should be developed, as for instance, techniques concerning
deformations of foliations. We will not follow this method here.

2. Generalities

In dimension n ≥ 2, a germ of codimension one holomorphic foliation F is called
cuspidal if, besides being generalized hypersurface (see Section 1 and [9]), its sep-
aratrix is deﬁned in appropriate coordinates (x, z), where x := (x1, x2, · · · , xn−1),
by a reduced equation z2 + ϕ(x) = 0, with ν0(ϕ(x)) ≥ 2. In [11, Thm. 1.4] we
constructed a pre-normal form for germs of holomorphic foliation of cuspidal type.
In particular, if z2 + ϕ(x) = 0 is a quasi-homogeneous hypersurface, we know that
there exist analytic coordinates such that a generator of F is the 1-form

ω = d(z2 + ϕ) + G(Ψ, z)(z · Ψ) ·(cid:18)2

dz
z

−

dϕ

ϕ (cid:19) ,

where ϕ = Ψr for some r ∈ N, Ψ is not a power, and G is a germ of holomorphic
function in two variables ([11, Cor. 4.2]).

In dimension three, there exist analytic coordinates (x, y, z) such that

Ψ = xn1 yn2

(yp − aixq)di,

lYi=1

where ni, p, q ∈ N, and ai ∈ C∗ are pairwise distinct. After [11, Thm. 2.4] and [9,
Thm. 11], the reduction of the singularities of this type of foliations follows the
same scheme that the desingularization of their separatrix S,

S := z2 + xn1 yn2

(yp − aixq)di = 0.

lYi=1

A key to prove the main result of this paper (Theorem 6) is the existence of the
ﬁrst integral in the intersections of the components of the exceptional divisor. Let us
mention in dimension two the work [17], where it is said that the classiﬁcation tech-
nique from R. Moussu [27] and F. Loray [14] can be used in the quasi-homogeneous
framework, provided that the coordinate axis are not part of this set of separatrices.
i.e., after reduction of singularities, all the separatrices lie on the same component
of the exceptional divisor. Because of this, we will assume an analogous hypothesis
in dimension three, i.e., n1 = n2 = 0, and Theorem 6 will be proved based on
this property. This means that coordinate hyperplanes are not part of its set of
separatrices. Let us mention that on the other hand, in [12] this hypothesis is not
considered, but other techniques of a rather diﬀerent nature have been used, which
will not be addressed here. According to this, let us state the following deﬁnition:

Deﬁnition 1. A cuspidal holomorphic foliation, F , in (C3, 0) is called quasi-
homogeneous of admissible type, if its separatrix, in appropriate coordinates,
is deﬁned by the equation

S = z2 +

(yp − aixq)di = 0,

lYi=1

4 PERCY FERN ´ANDEZ-S ´ANCHEZ, JORGE MOZO-FERN ´ANDEZ, AND HERN ´AN NECIOSUP

where p, q ≥ 2, ai ∈ C∗, and ai 6= aj, if i 6= j.

So, a quasi-homogeneous foliations of admissible type is generated by a 1-form

(1)

where ϕ = Ψr =

Ω = d(z2 + ϕ) + G(Ψ, z) · z · Ψ(cid:18) dϕ
lYi=1

ϕ

(yp − aixq)di, p, q ≥ 2, r = gcd(d1, · · · , dl).

− 2

dz

z (cid:19) ,

In general, let us denote by Fω a holomorphic foliation of codimension one
generated by an integrable 1-form ω ∈ Ω1(Cn, 0). Not every such 1-form deﬁnes a
quasi-homogeneous foliation of admissible type, as we have imposed to the deﬁnition
the condition of being a generalized surface. In general, such a foliation may have
more separatrices, or be dicritical. In [11, Thm. 5.2] a suﬃcient condition is stated
Gα,βΨαzβ,

for being a generalized surface. More precisely, if we write G(Ψ, z) =Xα,β

and

ν2,r(G) := min(cid:26) 2α + rβ

gcd(2, r)

; Gα,β 6= 0(cid:27) ,

then, if ν2,r(G) ≥ r−2

gcd(2,r) , the foliation is a generalized surface.

On the other hand, let us observe that if di = 1 for all i, ϕ is reduced and the
singular locus of FΩ is the origin of coordinates. By Frobenius singular Theorem
[16], FΩ admits holomorphic ﬁrst integral and the study of these foliations is then
equivalent to that of the surfaces. We will suppose, at any time, that di > 1 for
some i, and we will denote Σ(d1,··· ,dl)
the set of integrable 1-forms analytically
equivalent to a 1-form as in (1), with di > 1 for some i.

3. Desingularization of quasi homogeneous foliations

Let us consider a quasi-homogeneous foliation of admissible type, FΩ, generated
by an integrable 1-form Ω ∈ Σd1,··· ,dl
, according with the notations of Section
2. The reduction of the singularities of FΩ is achieved after the reduction of its
separatrices. We use in this paper a precise reduction, namely the one obtained by
Weierstrass-Jung method, that we shall sketch here for the sake of completeness.
This precise reduction will be useful in the sequel in order to extend the conjugation
of the holonomy to a whole neighbourhood of the exceptional divisor.

This reduction will be described in three steps:

Step I: The separatrix S being deﬁned by z2 + ϕ(x, y) = z2 +

With the conditions imposed, the singular locus S := Sing(eF ), is an analytic

space of dimension 1 with normal crossings. S is given by the intersection of the
components of the divisor E, along with the intersection of the strict transform of S
with the divisor. These components are denoted as Dα, Dαj, Aj × D (see Section
3 for notations). It will be useful, in order to study the projective holonomy of the

foliation, to know their homotopy type, once we have removed the singular locus.
Let us describe it brieﬂy in this section.

In the ﬁrst step of the reduction we have produced several components Dα. After

removing the singular locus they are homotopically equivalent to:

Dα r S ≈

C × C∗,


t2 −  lYi=1

C × C,

C∗ × C∗,

if α = 1;

if 1 < α ≤ c0 + 1;

in other cases.

(yδ − ai)d′

i!r

= 0,

The components Dαj appearing in the second step, removing the singular locus,
are homotopically equivalent to C × C∗, to C∗ × C∗, to C × (C r {2 points}), or,
in the most interesting case, to (C∗ × C) r C, where, in coordinates (y, t), C is the
aﬃne curve deﬁned by t2 − ya.v = 0, where v is a unit, or

with previous notations.

Finally, Step III produces new components homotopically equivalent to C × C,
C∗ × C or (C r {2 points}) × C, that are not relevant for our study. However,
we highlight the component Dαj (generated in the second step) which is modiﬁed

now to eD (essential component deﬁned in Section 3), but whose topology does not
change in this step and consequently eD r Sing(eFΩ) ≈ (C∗ × C) r C.

The fundamental group of (C∗ × C) r C can be computed using the Zariski-
Van Kampen method, as described, for instance, in [1] (see also [33] as a classical
reference). Even if it is standard enough, for the sake of completeness we shall
brieﬂy review here this method. Consider the projection ρ : C2 → C, ρ(x, t) = x.

Let us denote by ∆ := {a1, a2, · · · , al} and L :=[j

ρ−1(aj). The restriction

(2)

ρ : C2 r C ∪ L → C r ∆,

is a locally trivial ﬁbration, with ﬁbres isomorphic to C r {2 points}. So, for every
point in C r ∆, we obtain the exact sequence

1

/ π1 (C r {2 points})

i∗

/ π1(C2 r C ∪ L)

s∗

ρ∗

/ π1(C r ∆)

/ 1 ,

where i∗ and s∗ are map induced in homotopy from inclusion and section of ρ
respectively. Let D ⊂ C be a suﬃciently big closed disk, such that ∆ is contained
in its interior. Choose a point ⋆ on ∂D. Take a small disk Dj centered at aj ∈ ∆
containing no other elements of ∆ and choose a point R ∈ ∂Dj. Consider a path
α ∈ Cr∆ joining R and ⋆, and denote by ηR,Dj the closed path based at R that runs
counterclockwise along ∂Dj. The homotopy class of the loop γj := α−1.ηR,Dj .α is
called a meridian of aj in C r ∆. Then, the collections of meridians in C r ∆ (one
for each point of ∆) deﬁne bases of π1(C r ∆, ⋆). Similarly we can choose meridians
g1, g2 in a ﬁber of the restriction (2) and γ a meridian around the straight line

5. Holonomy of the essential component

The dynamical behavior of one foliation may be studied in a neighbourhood of a
leaf by the representation of its fundamental group, as introduced by C. Ehresmann
in 1950. In this study we will mainly follow J.-F. Mattei and R. Moussu [23]: let
us choose a point p of a leaf L and a germ of a transversal section Σ in p. The
lifting of a closed path γ starting in p, following the leaves of the foliation, induces
germs of diﬀeomorphisms

hγ : (Σ, p) → (Σ, p),

that only depend on the homotopy class of the path. The map hγ is called holonomy
of the leaf L. The representation of the holonomy of π1(L, p) is the morphism
deﬁned by

Hol(L)

: π1(L, p) → Dif f (Σ, p)

γ

hγ,

and the holonomy group of the foliation along L is the image of this application
Hol(L). Diﬀerent points in the leaf and diﬀerent transversal sections deﬁne conju-
gated representations.

In order to lift the path γ it is necessary to have a ﬁbration, that is transverse to
the foliation. Let us describe it. In general let Ω be an integrable 1-form in (C3, 0),

6. Analytic classification

In this section we will study the analytic classiﬁcation of quasi-homogeneous
cuspidal foliations FΩ in (C3, 0), using as the main tool the lifting of the projective
holonomy, as stated in previous sections.

As described in Section 4, after the reduction of singularities of a quasi-homogeneous

cuspidal holomorphic foliation in (C3, 0), the ﬁrst component, D1, of the exceptional
divisor E, is either

• D1 r S ≃ C∗ × C∗, if the separatrix of FΩ is deﬁned by the equation

z2 + xn1 yn2

lYi=1(cid:0)yp − aixq(cid:1)di = 0, with (n1, n2) 6= (0, 0),

• or D1 r S ≃ C2, if the separatrix of FΩ is deﬁned by the equation

z2 +

lYi=1(cid:0)yp − aixq(cid:1)di = 0.

In the admissible case that we are studying, D1 r S is simply connected, so, the
existence of a ﬁrst integral around it is guaranteed due to the results of Mattei and
Moussu [23]. In order to be able to extend this ﬁrst integral, and consequently, to
extend the conjugation diﬀeomorphism, it would be necessary to impose additional
technical conditions on one, or possibly several components of the exceptional divi-
sor, that we will be call in the sequel special components. These special components
will be those that arise at the end of the monoidal transformations with center the

projective lines D1 ∩ S1, Dc0+1 ∩ Sc0+1 that we will denote by eD′, eD′′ respectively.

Note that

This will motivate the following deﬁnition:

eD′ r S ≃ C × (C r {2pts}) ≈ eD′′ r S.

to non-zero eigenvalues of the linear part. In higher dimension, the separatrix is called strong if
it corresponds to a strong separatrix in dimension two for a generic plane transversal section.

The following theorem is the main result of this paper.

FΩ2 that satisfy one of the properties ℘1, ℘2 if we are in one of the cases described
above, with exceptional holonomy groups HΩi, ˜D = hhi

consequence, the holonomy of the leaf D2 r S ≈ C× C∗, generated by a loop around
L1 := D1 ∩ D2, is periodic (see [23]). The same argument proves that Dα r S has

Lα := Dα ∩ Dα+1, 1 ≤ α ≤ c0 + 1.

On the other hand, the leaves Dα r S ≈ C∗ × C∗ have periodic holonomy,

generated by two loops around the lines

Lα = Dα ∩ Dα+1;

sν = Dα ∩ Dsν .

The above arguments prove the existence of the ﬁrst integral around the lines

Lαj := Dαj ∩ Dα(j−1)

where α, j are such that Dαj r S ≈ C × C∗ or ≈ C∗ × C∗.

Finally, we need to guarantee the existence of the ﬁrst integral around the points
that represent the intersection of the divisor with the strict transform of the sepa-
ratrix. These points are in the components Dαj, and:

• Either Dαj r S ≈ C × (C r {2 points}),
• or Dαj r S ≈ C∗ × (C r {2 points}),
• or Dαj r S ≈ (C∗ × C) r C.

Let us denote by D := Dαj such that Dαj r S ≈ C × (C r {2 points}). Note

that D ∩eS = L1 ∪ L2 or D ∩eS = L, where eS represents the strict transform of the

separatrix, and L, L1, L2 are projective lines.

Now let us prove the existence of the ﬁrst integral around the points (see Figure

Let hαi be the holonomy associated to αi, loop around Li; hαi is linearizable. Now
let us consider β ⊂ D r S ≃ C × (C r {2 points}), a loop around Dαj ∩ D. Note
that β ⊂ C × {1 point} ≃ C; so, β is homotopically trivial and the associated
holonomy to β is 1C, the identity map, hβ = 1C. Then, the holonomy group of

Dαj r S is linearizable and therefore, around ρi, eΩi is linearizable. So, there exists

a ﬁrst integral around ρi. Consider now the points µi (see Figure 4), and hγ, the
holonomy associated to γ, loop around the projective line D(α+1)j ∩ Dαj. Note that
γ is such that γ−1 is a loop around Dα−1 ∩ Dαj, so hγ−1 is the holonomy of the
leaf Dα−1 r S, which is periodic. Then around µi there exists a ﬁrst integral. In a

D ∩ eS = L. It is easy to see that around L there exist a ﬁrst integral, and the

existence of ﬁrst integral around the lines L1, L2 follows, from property ℘2, as in
the previous case.

Let us see now the extension of Ψ around all the exceptional divisor. The idea is,
ﬁrst, to extend Ψ to a neighborhood of all the components of the divisor in which
the separatrix intersects, and ﬁnally to extend it to the rest of the components. In
both situations we should respect the ﬁbration and the ﬁrst integral that we have

on Ψ2(eFΩ2 ), and respects the ﬁrst integral

xmν snν +2(ǫ−1)tnν −2ǫ.

It is deﬁned on a set of the type

|xmν snν +2(ǫ−1)tnν −2ǫ| < ε,

in the considered charts, and this set intersects the domain of deﬁnition of Ψ. So
Ψ = Ψ2 ◦ Θ ◦ Ψ−1
can be extended to a neighbourhood of D(α−1)β ∩ D(α−1)(β−1).

and in consequence, Ψ can be extended to a neighbourhood of D(α−1)β. This process
can be repeated and extend Ψ to a neighbourhood of the exceptional divisor E. So
FΩi are analytically conjugated, outside of the singular locus of codimension two.
Finally, using Hartogs theorem we can obtain the extension of the conjugation
around of the origin.
