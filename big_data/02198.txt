ABSTRACT
We have performed a full time- and luminosity-resolved spectral analysis of the high-mass X-
ray binary 4U 1538−522 using the available RXTE, INTEGRAL, and Suzaku data, examining
both phase-averaged and pulse-phase-constrained datasets and focusing on the behavior of
the cyclotron resonance scattering feature (CRSF). No statistically signiﬁcant trend between
the energy of the CRSF and luminosity is observed in the combined dataset. However, the
CRSF energy appears to have increased by ∼ 1.5 keV in the ∼ 8.5 years between the RXTE
and Suzaku measurements, with Monte Carlo simulations ﬁnding the Suzaku measurement
4.6σ above the RXTE points. Interestingly, the increased Suzaku CRSF energy is much more
signiﬁcant and robust in the pulse-phase-constrained spectra from the peak of the main pulse,
suggesting a change that is limited to a single magnetic pole. The 7 years of RXTE mea-
surements do not show any strongly-signiﬁcant evolution with time on their own. We discuss
the signiﬁcance of the CRSF’s behavior with respect to luminosity and time in the context
of historical observations of this source as well as recent observational and theoretical work
concerning the neutron star accretion column, and suggest some mechanisms by which the
observed change over time could occur.

1 INTRODUCTION

Many neutron stars possess magnetic ﬁelds with dipole strengths
in excess of 1012 G, making them some of the strongest magnets in
the universe. Material that falls onto the neutron star (NS) is chan-
neled along the ﬁeld lines and is concentrated onto the magnetic
poles, forming a hot, dense column of accreted plasma. The con-
ditions within this accretion column are extreme: the infalling ma-
terial comes in at relativistic (v ∼ 0.5c) velocities and must come
to a halt by the time it reaches the NS surface. Radiation pressure
in the column can play a signiﬁcant role here, shaping the dynam-
ics of the column, which in turn inﬂuences the observed radiation
spectrum (see, e.g., Becker et al. 2012).

Cyclotron resonance scattering features (CRSFs, also referred
to as “cyclotron lines”) are pseudo-absorption features found in

the hard X-ray spectra of approximately two dozen accreting X-
ray pulsars. The ﬁrst CRSF was discovered in Hercules X-1 by
Trümper et al. (1978). CRSFs appear as a result of the quantized
nature of electron cyclotron motion in the characteristically strong
magnetic ﬁeld of young pulsars, which creates resonances in the
electron-photon scattering cross-section at the cyclotron line ener-
gies and scatters photons out of the line of sight. These features
are notable for being the only direct means of measuring the ﬁeld
strength of the NS, as their centroid energy is directly proportional
to the ﬁeld strength in the scattering region.

The last several years have seen a great deal of activity around
cyclotron lines, mainly focused on the variation of the CRSF en-
ergy with luminosity. The Be/X-ray binary V 0332+53 displays a
signiﬁcant negative correlation between CRSF energy and lumi-
nosity (Mowlavi et al. 2006; Tsygankov et al. 2010), while Her X-
1 (Staubert et al. 2007) and GX 304-1 (Yamamoto et al. 2011;
Klochkov et al. 2012) show positive correlations. This relationship

2

can be complex: NuSTAR observations of Vela X-1 (Fürst et al.
2014) found that the energy of the ﬁrst harmonic of the CRSF was
positively correlated with luminosity, while the behavior of the fun-
damental was more difﬁcult to discern, while A 0535+26’s CRSF
is fairly constant at most luminosities (Caballero et al. 2007) but
does display a positive correlation between the CRSF energy and
ﬂux in certain pulse phase bins (Klochkov et al. 2011; Müller et al.
2013b). A 0535+26 may also have a positive correlation in phase-
averaged spectra at its highest luminosities (Sartore et al. 2015).

A superb, well-studied example of complicated CRSF be-
havior can be found in Her X-1, whose CRSF shows a posi-
tive Ecyc-luminosity correlation (Staubert et al. 2007; Vasco et al.
2011), variability with pulse phase (Vasco et al. 2013), and varia-
tion with the phase of Her X-1’s 35 d super-orbital period. Most re-
cently, Staubert et al. (2014) showed that for Her X-1, on top of all
these observed trends, there is additional variability in the CRSF
energy that can only be explained by a long-term decrease in the
CRSF energy. Recent NuSTAR observations of Her X-1 have con-
ﬁrmed this trend (Fürst et al. 2013). This result suggests that there
is the possibility for some long-term evolution within the accretion
column that is not observable either in the overall spectral shape or
the luminosity of the source.

The accreting X-ray pulsar 4U 1538−522 was discovered by
the Uhuru satellite (Giacconi et al. 1974), and the system was iden-
tiﬁed as an X-ray pulsar by Becker et al. (1977); Davison (1977),
and Davison et al. (1977). The system consists of a ∼ 1 M⊙ NS ac-
creting from the stellar wind of QV Nor, a ∼ 16 M⊙ B0Iab star
(Reynolds et al. 1992; Rawls et al. 2011; Falanga et al. 2015). Esti-
mates of 4U 1538−522’s distance have ranged from 4.5 kpc (Clark
2004) to 6.4 ± 1.0 kpc (Reynolds et al. 1992), with older measure-
ments by Crampton et al. (1978) and Ilovaisky et al. (1979) ﬁnd-
ing 6.0 ± 0.5 kpc and 5.5 ± 1.5 kpc, respectively. The system’s bi-
nary parameters have similarly been difﬁcult to constrain: while
the 3.7 d orbital period was established by some of the earliest
observations (Becker et al. 1977; Davison et al. 1977), the orbital
parameters found by Makishima et al. (1987); Clark (2000), and
Mukherjee et al. (2006) disagree on whether this orbit is circular
or elliptical. While we adopt an eccentricity of 0.174 ± 0.015 from
Clark (2000) and Mukherjee et al. (2006), we note that this choice
has only minimal effects on this analysis. Interestingly, Rawls et al.
(2011) estimated the neutron star mass to be 0.874 ± 0.073 M⊙
when using the elliptical orbital solution and 1.104 ± 0.177 M⊙ for
a circular orbit — using either orbital solution, their results clearly
suggest that 4U 1538−522 contains a surprisingly low-mass neu-
tron star.

The pulse period of 4U 1538−522 has an interesting his-
tory. Around the time of its discovery,
its pulse period was
528.93 ± 0.10 s (Becker et al. 1977); over the next decade this
increased to at least 530.43 ± 0.014 s (Makishima et al. 1987;
Corbet et al. 1993), but CGRO-BATSE observations revealed that
the source underwent a torque reversal sometime in 1989 or 1990
(Rubin et al. 1997). The spin-up trend continued (Clark 2000;
Coburn 2001; Mukherjee et al. 2006; Baykal et al. 2006) for ap-
proximately 20 years, until another torque reversal in ∼ 2008 put
the source on its current spin-down trend, as revealed by Fermi-
GBM1 (Finger et al. 2009), INTEGRAL (Hemphill et al. 2013), and
Suzaku (Hemphill et al. 2014). The pulse period is currently ∼
526 s.

4U 1538−522’s ∼ 20 keV CRSF was discovered by Clark et al.
(1990) in Ginga observations. The Ginga spectra were further an-
alyzed by Makishima et al. (1987). The feature has since been ob-
served in data from RXTE (Coburn 2001; Rodes-Roca et al. 2009),
BeppoSAX (Robba et al. 2001), INTEGRAL (Rodes-Roca et al.
2009; Hemphill et al. 2013), and Suzaku (Hemphill et al. 2014).
A direct comparison of these results is somewhat difﬁcult, as the
various authors used different models for the spectral continuum
and the CRSF, as well as different energy bands when calcu-
lating ﬂuxes. Discussions of the effects of model choice on the
measured CRSF energy can be found in Müller et al. (2013a) and
Hemphill et al. (2013). However, limiting ourselves to results us-
ing the same models, there is a noticeable change between the
early RXTE observations in 1996–1997, which found the CRSF at
20.66+0.05
−0.06 keV (Coburn 2001), and the 2012 observation by Suzaku,
where Hemphill et al. (2014) found the feature at 22.2+0.8
−0.7 keV. It
should be noted, however, that the early RXTE spectral ﬁt of Coburn
(2001) had a very poor reduced χ2 of ∼ 2.2, so its small error bars
should not be viewed as authoritative.

In this paper, we re-analyze the archival RXTE, INTEGRAL,
and Suzaku observations of 4U 1538−522 using consistent spec-
tral models to better understand and quantify this apparent trend.
We also produce the best-yet characterization of the CRSF’s vari-
ability with luminosity. After a summary of the data used and the
data reduction procedure in Section 2 and a brief timing analysis
of the source in Section 3, we present our spectral analysis and
results in Sections 4 and 5. A discussion of these results in the con-
text of recent theoretical work can be found in Section 6. All plots
display 90% error bars, and we generally present 1-sigma (68%)
conﬁdence intervals on linear ﬁts to our results, unless otherwise
indicated.

2 OBSERVATIONS & DATA ANALYSIS

A search of the NASA High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive
(HEASARC) ﬁnds 70 RXTE observation IDs (obsids) containing
4U 1538−522 between the years 1996 and 2004. There is addi-
tionally a single Suzaku observation from 2012. We supplement
our results with ∼ 700 ks of INTEGRAL data lying mostly between
the RXTE and Suzaku observations; more in-depth analyses of the
available INTEGRAL data can be found in Rodes-Roca et al. (2009)
and Hemphill et al. (2013). Overall, our dataset for 4U 1538−522
spans 16 years, from the earliest RXTE observations in 1996 to the
2012 Suzaku observation. We summarize the analyzed observations
of 4U 1538−522 in Table 1. The RXTE, INTEGRAL, and Suzaku
lightcurves are plotted in Fig. 1.

Unless otherwise stated, all spectral and lightcurve analysis
was performed using version 1.6.2-30 of the Interactive Spectral
Interpretation System (ISIS; Houck & Denicola 2000).

2.1 RXTE data

The Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE; Bradt et al. 1993)
carried two instruments relevant to this study: the Proportional
Counter Array (PCA; Jahoda et al. 1996, 2006), a set of ﬁve propor-
tional counter units (PCU 0–4) with a nominal energy range of 2–
60 keV, and the High Energy X-ray Timing Experiment (HEXTE;
Rothschild et al. 1998), which consists of two independent clus-
ters of phoswich scintillation detectors (HEXTE-A and HEXTE-
B), each with an energy range of 15–250 keV. The HEXTE de-
tectors rocked between on-source and off-source positions to ob-

tain near-real-time background data; while there were times later
in the mission where this rocking mechanism failed, all RXTE ob-
servations of 4U 1538−522 were taken while both HEXTE rocking
mechanisms were functional.

Four RXTE proposals included observations of 4U 1538−522:
P10145, P20146, P50067, and P80016. P20146 was a monitoring
campaign: a year’s worth of monthly snapshot observations be-
tween 1996 and 1997, each with ∼ 2 ks exposure, The remaining
three proposals, from 1997, 2001, and 2003, respectively, were ded-
icated pointed observations with many observations within a few
3.7 d orbital periods. Each proposal’s data are divided into multi-
ple observation IDs with exposures ranging from a few to a few
dozen kiloseconds each; after excluding observations taken close
to and during the X-ray eclipse, our ﬁnal RXTE dataset comprises
50 obsids. We extracted PCA and HEXTE spectra and lightcurves
from each obsid using the standard RXTE pipeline found in version
6.16 of the HEASOFT software distribution. We then determined

MNRAS 000, 1–17 (2015)

the pulse period of the source and extracted spectra in luminosity
and phase bins of interest to this analysis.

Calibration uncertainties in the background modeling for the
RXTE PCA at high energies can result in the background count rate
being over- or under-estimated by a few percent. Thus, during spec-
tral ﬁtting, we correct the background in the PCA via the corback
procedure in ISIS. The magnitude of this shift was typically on the
order of a few percent, on average reducing the background count-
ing rate by ∼ 2%. This correction allowed us to take PCA spectra
between 3 and 60 keV; HEXTE spectra were used between 18 and
80 keV.

2.2 Suzaku data

Suzaku carries two sets of instruments: four X-ray Imaging Spec-
trometers (XIS 0-3; Koyama et al. 2007) and the Hard X-ray Detec-
tor (HXD; Takahashi et al. 2007). The XIS telescopes are imaging

4

P. B. Hemphill et al.

CCD detectors with 0.2–12 keV energy ranges. XIS2 was taken of-
ﬂine in 2006 after a micrometeorite impact, and so we only use
XIS0, XIS1, and XIS3 data. The HXD consists of a set of silicon
PIN diodes (energy range 10–70 keV) and a GSO scintillator (40–
600 keV); we only used HXD/PIN data in the hard X-ray band, as
the GSO signal-to-noise ratio was very low.

Suzaku observed 4U 1538−522 on 10 August 2012 for
61.9 ks. The reduction of the Suzaku data is explained at length
in Hemphill et al. (2014). In this analysis, we focus on the phase-
averaged data from the ﬁrst half of the observation (as the second
half contains signiﬁcantly higher variability), as well as the pulse
phase-constrained spectrum of the peak of the main pulse and the
secondary pulse (phase bins 1 and 4 in Hemphill et al. 2014). The
data were reprocessed and spectra were extracted using the stan-
dard Suzaku pipeline in HEASOFT v6.16. We used XIS data be-
tween 1 and 12 keV, taking the standard step of ignoring bins be-
tween 1.6 and 2.3 keV due to calibration uncertainties in that range.
Data below 1 keV was ignored to avoid having to model the soft ex-
cess at those energies, which is outside the scope of this work. We
rebinned the XIS spectra according to the binning scheme used by
Nowak et al. (2012), which attempts to best account for the spec-
tral resolution of the XIS detectors. The HXD/PIN data were used
between 15 and 60 keV and rebinned to a minimum of 100 counts
per bin.

2.3 INTEGRAL data

We used two of the instruments aboard INTEGRAL to supplement
the RXTE and Suzaku analysis: ISGRI, a 15 keV to 2 MeV CdTe
imager which forms the upper layer of the coded-mask IBIS tele-
scope, and JEM-X, a pair of coded mask X-ray monitors which
work in the 3–35 keV band. There are a total of 870 ∼ 2 ks expo-
sure Science Windows (SCWs) which include 4U 1538−522 within
the 9◦ × 9◦ fully-coded ﬁeld of view (FCFOV) of ISGRI and 211
with the source inside the 4.8◦-diameter FCFOV of JEM-X. We
extracted ISGRI and JEM-X spectra using the standard analysis
pipelines found in version 10.0 of the Ofﬂine Scientiﬁc Analysis
(OSA) software package.

The available data lie mostly in a few INTEGRAL revolutions,
so we produced four spectra each for ISGRI and JEM-X 1, adding
together SCWs from revolutions 0200 through 0299, 0300 through
0399, 0700 through 0799, and 0900 through 0999, totalling 667
ISGRI and 125 JEM-X 1 science windows (there were not enough
JEM-X 2 SCWs in this dataset to produce good spectra). These
cover the years 2004–2006 and 2009–2010. This extraction pro-
vides long exposures (long exposures are needed due to the low
signal-to-noise inherent in coded-mask detectors) while still main-
taining some time resolution.

The background for each pixel in a coded-mask detector con-
tains contributions from every point on the sky in the ﬁeld of view,
so it was necessary to compile a list of bright sources in the FOV
for each SCW. This list was fed back into the background subtrac-
tion routines in the standard spectral extraction procedure. These
data give us INTEGRAL results that lie in the temporal gap between
the RXTE and Suzaku observations. Several INTEGRAL revolutions
from after 2010 include many SCWs with 4U 1538−522 in the ﬁeld
of view; however, these data are rather sparse and, due to the long-
term evolution of the ISGRI detector, the recommendation for the

most recent observations is to ignore data below 22 keV2. For these
reasons, these data are not suitable for this analysis.

3 TIMING ANALYSIS

To determine the pulse period of the source, we extracted barycen-
tered lightcurves for each RXTE obsid. After applying a binary
orbit correction using orbital parameters from Clark (2000) and
Mukherjee et al. (2006) (see Table 2), we used epoch folding
(Leahy et al. 1983) to determine an initial guess for the pulse pe-
riod in each obsid. By folding the lightcurve on the pulse period,
we produced a “reference” pulse proﬁle for each obsid, which was
then compared via cross-correlation to each individual pulse in the
lightcurve (the source is bright enough that individual pulses are
clearly visible in the RXTE/PCA lightcurve, so no averaging was
necessary). The peak in the cross-correlation results gives the phase
shift between the reference pulse proﬁle and the individual pulse.
By ﬁtting the time-of-arrival and phase-shift results for each RXTE
proposal with a polynomial in pulse frequency, a more precise pic-
ture of the pulse period can be obtained, as a linear trend in the
phase shift over time indicates a shift in the frequency from the
originally assumed value, while higher-order terms in the ﬁt return
the derivatives of the pulse frequency.

δϕ(t) = ϕ0 + δν(t − t0) +

˙ν(t − t0)2

(1)

Here, t contains the times-of-arrival of the pulses, ϕ0 is the phase at
t = t0 (in our case, we deﬁne ϕ0 and t0 such that the peak of the main
pulse is ϕ = 0.0), δν is the deviation of the true pulse frequency
from the originally assumed value computed by epoch folding, and
˙ν is the pulse frequency derivative. With the exception of RXTE
proposal P20146, the RXTE data were over short enough timespans
that the evolution of the pulse period was not needed in the model,
and we ﬁxed ˙ν to zero in these cases. This returns results which are
broadly in line with the analyses of Coburn (2001) and Baykal et al.
(2006). Our pulse period measurements, with 90% conﬁdence in-
tervals, are displayed in Table 3. We additionally include the pulse
period during the Suzaku observation, as reported in Hemphill et al.
(2014).

In Fig. 2, we plot the 2–10 keV and 20–30 keV pulse pro-
ﬁles for the three focused RXTE proposals (P10145, P50067, and
P80016) using PCA as well as the Suzaku observation (using the
XIS for the 2–10 keV proﬁle and the PIN for the 20–30 keV pro-
ﬁle), with the phase bins used in our spectral extraction indicated.
Due to the long timespan and relatively large uncertainty in ˙P for
RXTE proposal P20146, we do not plot the proﬁle for that set of
obsids. At higher energies, the primary pulse narrows and the sec-
ondary pulse weakens considerably; the pulse proﬁles for RXTE
and Suzaku are qualitatively similar in both bands with the excep-
tion that the secondary pulse appears to vanish completely in the
PIN proﬁle while the PCA proﬁle still shows a weak secondary
pulse. There are no pronounced phase shifts in the positions of the
peaks or major changes in the overall structure of the pulse pro-
ﬁle with energy, unlike, e.g., 4U 0115+63 (Ferrigno et al. 2009) or
Vela X-1 (Kreykenbohm et al. 2002).

Our aim in this paper is to examine and quantify the change over
time in the CRSF energy of 4U 1538−522. This necessitates con-
trolling for other parameters which may inﬂuence the measured line
energy. Thus, we perform our analysis on four different selections
of data. The ﬁrst, and simplest, selection is the spectra from each
of the RXTE obsids. This is a phase-averaged dataset, with no cuts
based on luminosity or pulse phase, although we do exclude obser-
vations taken during the eclipse. This dataset comprises 50 RXTE
spectra and the single Suzaku observation, and covers a fairly wide
range of ﬂuxes. Second, we determined the peak PCU2 counting
rate in each individual pulse and produced a set of good time inter-
vals (GTIs) for four counting rate bins, with cuts at 103, 123, 140,
and 171 counts per second (the Suzaku observation’s mean ﬂux is
approximately in line with the 123–140 count/s RXTE bin). These
GTIs were used to extract a set of phase-averaged and luminosity-
selected spectra. Note that this dataset is constructed on a pulse-by-
pulse basis, adding up all individual pulses in a proposal that are
in a given range of counting rates. This avoids averaging over too
broad of a range of ﬂuxes while also ensuring that the dataset is
fully phase-averaged, with better statistics than the obsid-by-obsid
dataset. Finally, using the pulse period of the source, we produced
GTIs and extracted spectra for the peak of the main pulse and for
the secondary pulse.

P. B. Hemphill et al.

For our pulse-phase-constrained analysis, in order to ensure
that we selected the same pulse phase bins across all datasets, we
computed the cross-correlation between the 2–10 keV RXTE PCA
and Suzaku XIS proﬁles; the shift in the PCA proﬁle which gives
the largest value of the correlation coefﬁcient is thus the phase shift
between that PCA proﬁle and the XIS proﬁle, which was then used
to deﬁne phase 0.0 in all datasets. For RXTE proposals P10145,
P50067, and P80016, we used the pulse proﬁle from the full pro-
posal lightcurve, as the change in the pulse period is small over
the few days that each proposal spans. RXTE proposal P20146 was
treated on an obsid-by-obsid basis due to its extended duration and
the long gaps between observations. The pulse phase bins used for
the RXTE data thus correspond to the 1st and 4th phase bins used
in Hemphill et al. (2014), each of which has a width of one-sixth of
the pulse. The phase bins used are plotted in Fig. 2.

The main pulse spectra were restricted to a PCA counting
rate between 60 and 200 counts/s and the secondary pulse spec-
tra were restricted to a 50–160 counts/s range in order to avoid
major dips and ﬂares. This phase-resolved analysis is essential,
as the CRSF energy varies over 4U 1538−522’s pulse by 5–10 %
(1–2 keV; Hemphill et al. 2014). Since the phase-averaged CRSF
energy is the weighted average of the observed CRSF across all
phase bins, any long-term evolution in either the pulse shape or
the CRSF’s variability with pulse phase could potentially inﬂuence
the measured CRSF energy in phase-averaged spectra. Performing
this pulse phase-constrained analysis allows us to account for this
effect.

For Suzaku, we produced a single set of XIS and HXD/PIN
spectra for the ﬁrst half of the observation (this is effectively the
sum of phase-averaged spectra 1 through 4 in Hemphill et al. 2014)
for comparison to the phase-averaged and luminosity-resolved
RXTE spectra, while for comparison to the pulse-phase-constrained
RXTE spectra we took the corresponding bins (phase-resolved
spectra 1 and 4) from the phase-resolved spectra of Hemphill et al.
(2014). The quality of the INTEGRAL data is not high enough to
warrant phase-resolved spectroscopy, so we simply use the four sets
of phase-averaged spectra as described in Section 2.3 for compari-
son to the phase-averaged RXTE and Suzaku datasets.

4.1 Spectral model

The choice of spectral model can inﬂuence the measured CRSF
parameters (see, e.g., Müller et al. 2013a). Thus, an important ﬁrst
step is to ensure that every spectrum is ﬁt with the same model.
There are several different phenomenological continuum models
used for accreting X-ray pulsars, and while no model is devoid of
problems, the model that we found worked best overall for RXTE,
Suzaku, and INTEGRAL was a powerlaw of photon index Γ mod-
iﬁed by the standard highecut high-energy cutoff (White et al.
1983):

plcut(E) = 

.

AE−Γ

E < Ecut

AE−Γ exp(cid:16) Ecut −E

Efold (cid:17) E ≥ Ecut

(2)

This piecewise model can result in spurious features around
the cutoff energy Ecut; we account for this by including a narrow
(width frozen to 0.01 keV) negative Gaussian with its energy tied
to the cutoff energy Ecut (see, e.g., Coburn et al. 2002; Fürst et al.
2013). For simplicity, we will refer to this modiﬁed powerlaw-
cutoff continuum model as mplcut.

The CRSF at ∼ 21 keV is modeled using a Gaussian optical
depth proﬁle, gauabs. This model component is identical to the
XSPEC model gabs with a slightly different deﬁnition of the line
depth parameter, which here represents the maximum optical depth
in the line, τ0:

gauabs(E) = e−τ(E)

τ(E) = τ0 exp −

(E − E0)2

2σ2

.

The ﬁrst harmonic of the CRSF is at ∼ 50 keV in 4U 1538−522
(Rodes-Roca et al. 2009; Hemphill et al. 2013). We include the har-
monic CRSF in the phase-averaged, luminosity-selected spectra,
using a gauabs feature with its depth free to vary but with energy
and width ﬁxed to 50 and 5 keV, respectively. The feature is only
detected (i.e., depth inconsistent with zero) in the brightest spec-
tra, but we include it in all the phase-averaged spectra in order to
ensure consistency in this dataset. The harmonic CRSF was not de-
tected in the individual obsids or the pulse phase-constrained data
and thus was not included in the ﬁnal model for those datasets. We
performed ﬁts for Suzaku with and without the harmonic CRSF, but
the only noticeable effect on the ﬁtted parameters was a slight de-
crease in the source ﬂux (due mainly to our chosen energy range of
3–50 keV including part of the harmonic CRSF).

Several X-ray pulsars, 4U 1538−522 included, show a pecu-
liar feature in their ∼ 8–12 keV spectrum. This typically appears as
broad emission around ∼ 10–11 keV (as such, it is usually called the
“10-keV bump” or “10-keV feature”), although it can be modeled
as an absorption feature at somewhat lower energy (Müller et al.
2012). A discussion of this feature, along with several examples,
can be found in Coburn (2001), although currently no satisfactory
physical explanation exists. In this work, most (∼ 80%) of our spec-
tra were poorly ﬁt without a 10-keV feature, with reduced χ2 > 1.4.
In these poorly-ﬁtted cases, we include a gauabs feature in the
model with energy ∼ 8.5 keV and width frozen to 1 keV. However,
in the ∼ 20% of spectra which were well-ﬁt without such a fea-
ture, its inclusion tended to severely overﬁt the spectrum (reduced
χ2 <
∼ 0.5). We thus include the feature only in the poorly-ﬁt cases,
in order to bring the reduced χ2 down to ∼ 1 and obtain realistic
error bars on the other ﬁtted parameters. There do not seem to be
any systematic factors which determine whether or not a particular
spectrum will need an 8-keV dip; the distributions of ﬁtted param-
eters and uncertainties for spectra with and without 8-keV features
are entirely consistent with each other. However, spectra which did
not need an 8-keV dip to obtain a good ﬁt do tend to have lower to-
tal counts, with an average of 7.7×105 counts compared to 1.8×106
for the spectra with an 8-keV dip. Thus, the lack of an 8-keV dip
in some spectra is an issue of data quality and is not of physical
origin. We also tried ﬁtting with an emissive feature at ∼ 11 keV
as has been used before (Rodes-Roca et al. 2009; Hemphill et al.
2013); however, the broad width of the 10-keV feature led to it in-
terfering with the parameters of the CRSF.

We do include an 8-keV dip in the model for Suzaku, in order
to bring that model as close as possible to the one we used for
RXTE. Its depth and energy are consistent with the values found by
RXTE. The INTEGRAL spectra suffered from the same issues as the
lower-quality RXTE spectra in this matter, so we did not include an
8-keV feature in those spectra.

The spectral model is further modiﬁed by an additive Gaus-
sian emission line modeling the iron K α at ∼ 6.4 keV, as well as

MNRAS 000, 1–17 (2015)

photoelectric absorption, using the latest version 3 of the tbnew
absorption model (Wilms et al. 2010). We used the abundances
from Wilms et al. (2000) and the cross-sections from Verner et al.
(1996). The iron K α energy is ﬁxed to 6.4 keV in the RXTE spec-
tra, and the line width is ﬁxed to 0.01 keV in all spectra, as it is
unresolved even at the energy resolution of Suzaku’s XIS.

To ﬁnish out the model, we apply a multiplicative constant
to each instrument to account for ﬂux calibration differences be-
tween the PCA and HEXTE, the XIS and HXD/PIN, and INTE-
GRAL’s JEM-X and ISGRI. The XIS0, PCA, and JEM-X constants
were ﬁxed to 1, while HEXTE and ISGRI’s constants were allowed
to vary, with the HEXTE constant typically taking values around
∼ 0.85 and ISGRI’s constant being found between 0.8 and 1. For
Suzaku, we left the HXD/PIN calibration constant free to vary in
the phase-averaged data, ﬁnding a value of 1.02+0.08
−0.02. The phase-
constrained spectra were very difﬁcult to constrain with the cali-
bration constant left free to vary, so we ﬁxed it to the recommended
value of 1.16 in that dataset. We plot a representative RXTE spectral
ﬁt and the best-ﬁt Suzaku spectrum and model in Fig. 3.

As a check, we also performed ﬁts with a “Fermi-Dirac cut-

off” continuum (Tanaka 1986):

pow ∗ fdcut(E) = AE−Γ

×"1 + exp  E − Ecut

Efold

!#−1

(5)

.

This, unlike plcut, is not piecewise. However, fdcut
tended to ﬁt
the RXTE data worse than mplcut; while we
were eventually able to obtain comparable goodness-of-ﬁt to our
mplcut results, it was necessary to include a signiﬁcantly deeper
8-keV dip, with central optical depths greater by a factor of ∼ 2–
10. In the cases with the most pronounced 8-keV dip, the remain-
ing spectral parameters were very poorly constrained. Fitting with
an emissive Gaussian at ∼ 11 keV resulted in somewhat better con-
straints on the continuum parameters, but lead to the same difﬁculty
disentangling the CRSF and 10-keV bump as we encountered us-
ing mplcut. Thus, we will rely primarily on our mplcut results,
supplementing with the fdcut results when applicable.

In all cases we calculate the unabsorbed continuum ﬂux in the
3–50 keV band by convolving our continuum model, 8-keV dip,
and CRSFs with an enflux spectral component in ISIS. We ﬁt the
RXTE and Suzaku spectra with this model (omitting the harmonic
CRSF in the case of the individual RXTE obsids), and calculated
90% error bars on all parameters. We used a considerably sim-
pler model for the INTEGRAL spectra, omitting the absorption, iron
line, and 8-keV dip — the low spectral sensitivity and 5 keV lower
energy bound of JEM-X meant these features were undetected.

5 RESULTS

Our analysis ﬁnds that 4U 1538−522 displays few signiﬁcant corre-
lations between spectral parameters. The spectral shape is relatively
stable over time, although the parameters are often quite broadly
scattered, especially in the obsid-by-obsid dataset. We present
the spectral parameters for the pulse-by-pulse, phase-averaged
RXTE dataset in Table 4, and the parameters for the pulse-phase-
constrained datasets in Table 5. The Suzaku and INTEGRAL param-
eters are presented in Tables 6 and 7, respectively. It was necessary

in a few cases to freeze spectral parameters to obtain a stable ﬁt:
the 3 keV lower energy bound of the RXTE/PCA meant we had to
freeze NH to its ﬁtted value in the 123–140 count s−1 bin of pro-
posal P10145 and the 140–171 count s−1 bin of proposal 80016.
Both spectra found NH at 2.9 × 1022 cm−2; since this low of an NH
does not have strong effects on the spectrum above 3 keV, it is un-
likely that ﬁxing this parameter has large effects on the other pa-
rameters. We also froze the energy of the 8-keV dip to 8.5 keV in
the model for the secondary pulse in both RXTE and Suzaku due to
the relatively poor quality and low ﬂux of those spectra. Finally, it
was necessary to freeze both the photon index to 1.2 and the CRSF
width to 3 keV in the INTEGRAL spectra from the 900–999 revolu-
tions to obtain a stable ﬁt.

We plot the iron line ﬂux, photon index, absorbing column
density, and 8-keV feature depth against luminosity (calculated
from the unabsorbed 5–50 keV ﬂux) in Fig. 4. The iron line ﬂux
shows a clear positive correlation with luminosity, with a slope
of (0.93 ± 0.03) × 10−3 ph cm−2 s−1 per 1037 erg s−1 in the obsid-
by-obsid dataset, while the photon index Γ displays a negative
correlation with luminosity, with a linear ﬁt ﬁnding a slope of
−0.262±0.006 in the obsid-by-obsid dataset. In both of these cases,
the ﬁtted slope in the pulse-by-pulse dataset is highly consistent
with the obsid-by-obsid result; the positive correlation between the
iron line ﬂux and broad-band ﬂux is not seen in the pulse-phase-
constrained results, but the iron line is near its weakest ﬂux in the
pulse peak (Hemphill et al. 2014) and the secondary peak phase bin
has low ﬂux overall, making the iron line difﬁcult to constrain in
PCA data in both phase-constrained datasets. Fits using the fdcut
continuum ﬁnd statistically similar results for these parameters.

The absorbing column density NH varies over the binary orbit,
typically sitting between 1 and 5 ×1022 cm−2 at most orbital phases,
but rising dramatically to ∼ 1023 cm−2 near eclipse. We plot NH ver-
sus orbital phase, using results from the obsid-by-obsid dataset, in
Fig. 5. While the increase in NH near eclipse is primarily a line-
of-sight effect, the high variability seen while the source is out of
eclipse indicates highly variable local absorption, consistent with
a clumpy or otherwise inhomogenous stellar wind. Our observed
variability in NH is largely consistent with RXTE/PCA and Bep-
poSAX data analyzed by Mukherjee et al. (2006) and with MAXI
results from Rodes-Roca et al. (2015). Qualitatively, we see some-
what higher variability over the orbit compared to the RXTE/PCA
results of Mukherjee et al. (2006), although this may be due to the
different absorption model and abundances that we use compared
to that analysis, in addition to our considerably larger energy cov-
erage. NH also appears to show some anticorrelation with the un-
absorbed ﬂux (see Fig. 4), but this correlation is statistically in-
signiﬁcant — taking NH measurements from obsids between orbital
phases 0.2 and 0.7 (i.e., ignoring eclipse ingress and egress), Pear-
son’s r for these two parameters is −0.12, for a p-value of 0.52.
The lowest observed NH is ∼ 0.6 × 1022 cm−2 and most obsids ﬁnd
NH above 1 × 1022 cm−2, consistent with the approximate line-of-
sight Galactic NH (Dickey & Lockman 1990; Kalberla et al. 2005;
Willingale et al. 2013) 4. This would point towards the local ab-
sorption dropping to effectively undetectable levels at times — e.g.,
at those points we are viewing the neutron star through a “hole” in
the surrounding medium.

The energy of the 8-keV dip feature is uncorrelated with the
source ﬂux, with an average energy of 7.6±1.6 keV in the pulse-by-

pulse dataset. However, the feature’s depth is clearly inversely cor-
related with luminosity (Fig. 4), trending down by −0.057 ± 0.015
per 1037 erg s−1. This decrease is in line with the fact that the
brighter spectra tend to be less likely to need the feature at all,
although with no physical explanation for the feature in the ﬁrst
place, the reason for the trend is unclear.

Across all RXTE obsids and the INTEGRAL and Suzaku mea-
surements, the ﬂux varies by a factor of ∼ 3, with most of the ob-
servations lying between 6 and 14 ×10−10 erg cm−2 s−1 (assuming
a distance of 6.4 kpc, this translates to a luminosity between 3 and
7 × 1036 erg s−1), reaching a peak luminosity of ∼ 1.2 × 1037 erg s−1
during ﬂares.

5.1 CRSF variability with luminosity

Previous analyses (Hemphill et al. 2013, 2014) have found only
tentative evidence for correlations between 4U 1538−522’s CRSF
energy and luminosity. With our considerably larger dataset, we
can report the best limits yet on any correlation between these two
parameters.

We plot the obsid-by-obsid and pulse-by-pulse CRSF en-
ergy versus the unabsorbed 3–50 keV ﬂux in the left-hand pan-
els of Fig. 6. Linear ﬁts to the obsid-by-obsid and pulse-by-pulse
RXTE datasets ﬁnd slopes of −0.48 ± 0.13 and 0.11 ± 0.19 keV
per 1037 erg s−1, respectively. No trend is visible in the RXTE peak-
pulse and secondary-pulse phase-constrained results (with the ex-
ception of the signiﬁcantly higher-energy Suzaku measurement),
consistent with what is seen in the pulse-by-pulse results.

The obsid-by-obsid results have an intriguing hint of a change
in slope at a luminosity of ∼ 6 × 1036 erg s−1, with a slope of
+1.0 ± 0.4 keV per 1037 erg s−1 below this luminosity and −1.48 ±

0.35 keV per 1037 erg s−1 for higher luminosities. This is especially
interesting given the observed bimodality of Ecyc-luminosity slopes
across all CRSF sources, with lower-luminosity sources showing
positive slopes and higher-luminosity sources showing negative
slopes. However, the obsids each average over a range of lumi-
nosities; the overall ﬂatness of the pulse-by-pulse measurements
may be a more authentic representation of the source’s true behav-
ior. Breaking the pulse-by-pulse CRSF measurements at a luminos-
ity of 6 × 1036 erg s−1 as we did for the obsid-by-obsid results, the
slopes are −0.1 ±0.8 and +1.20 ±0.65 keV per 10−37 erg s−1 for high
and low luminosities, respectively. The upward trend at lower lumi-
nosities for this dataset is only signiﬁcant at the ∼ 2σ level and is
entirely due to the two lowest-luminosity measurements; while this
suggests a break, similar to that seen in the obsid-by-obsid dataset,
at ∼ 4 × 1036 erg s−1, the lack of measurements at very low lumi-
nosity makes this trend highly suspect.

5.2 CRSF variability with time

In the phase-averaged and main-pulse spectra, there is a jump of ap-
proximately 1.5 keV in the energy of the cyclotron line between the
RXTE and Suzaku measurements, as can be seen in the right-hand
panels of Fig. 6 and the left-hand panel of Fig. 7, where we plot
the results from the pulse-phase-constrained datasets. This shift is
seen in both the mplcut and fdcut results. However, as can be
seen in the right panel of Fig. 7, there is no signiﬁcant increase in
the CRSF energy in the phase-constrained spectra of the secondary
pulse; while the poorly-constrained Suzaku results for that phase
bin are at least partially to blame here, there are some arguments
that this may be a real effect. In Fig. 8, we plot a closer look at the
data-to-model ratio residuals in the energy band around the CRSF

when the CRSF is excluded from the model, using the same data as
plotted in Fig. 3. The dip due to the CRSF in the Suzaku PIN data
is visibly higher-energy compared to the RXTE data.

While the INTEGRAL results help to ﬁll in the gap between
the RXTE and Suzaku results, their high uncertainties limit their
usefulness for this analysis. The RXTE results taken on their own
do not show any consistent trend with time; linear ﬁts to the obsid-
by-obsid and pulse-by-pulse results disagree, ﬁnding downward

(−0.033 ± 0.009 keV yr−1) and upward (+0.034 ± 0.015 keV yr−1)
trends, respectively.

To better quantify the statistical signiﬁcance of the Suzaku
measurement, and to avoid making any assumptions about the un-
derlying distribution of CRSF energy measurements, we took a
Monte Carlo approach. We constructed simulated obsid-by-obsid
datasets by varying each measured CRSF energy randomly accord-
ing to its 1σ uncertainty. Each trial in this manner thus produced a
set of 51 simulated CRSF energy measurements (50 RXTE points

and one Suzaku point); we then computed the signiﬁcance of the
simulated Suzaku point compared to the mean and standard devi-
ation of the simulated RXTE points. Performing 106 trials in this
manner, the Suzaku point was found on average 4.6σ above the
RXTE points, with a spread of 1.2σ.

To examine the possibility of systematic, instrumental differ-
ences in CRSF measurements between RXTE and Suzaku, either
due to differences in energy calibration or due to the difference in
energy coverage between the two satellites, we simulated Suzaku
spectra for each of the obsid-by-obsid RXTE spectral models using
the fakeit procedure in ISIS. The CRSF energy as measured in
these simulated spectra was generally within the uncertainties of
the RXTE measurements, ﬁnding a mean energy of 20.6 keV with
a standard deviation of 0.5 keV across all 50 spectra, compared to
20.7 ±0.3 keV in the real RXTE data — i.e., Suzaku is not systemat-
ically likely to measure higher CRSF energies compared to RXTE,
given the same underlying spectrum. However, this simulated ap-
proach does not account for any additional instrumental system-
atics — these results mainly tell us that the more limited energy
range covered by Suzaku does not contribute to overall changes in
the measured CRSF energy.

Our reported values use HXD/PIN data with a lower limit of
15 keV and XIS data with an upper limit of 12 keV. While these
instruments are usually considered to be reliable in these ranges,
their calibration is more poorly constrained as one approaches the
edges of their energy bounds. We thus checked our results by ﬁtting
the phase-averaged Suzaku spectra with the PIN limited to above
18 keV and the XIS limited to below 10 keV. Using these limits,
we still ﬁnd results consistent with our reported values. However,
the PIN normalization and cutoff energy are considerably less well-
constrained, at 1.2+0.3

−0.7 keV, respectively.

−0.4 and 17.8+5.1

The real Suzaku spectrum is still ﬁtted fairly well when the
CRSF energy is frozen to a typical RXTE value — ﬁxing the CRSF
energy to 20.7 keV results in a reduced χ2 value of 1.29 for 522 de-
grees of freedom, compared to 1.25 for 521 DOF when the CRSF
is left free to vary, with a reduction in χ2 of 19.3. This ﬁt also
brings the cutoff energy Ecut more into line with the measured val-
ues found using RXTE. However, the F-test probability for this im-
provement to arise by chance is 3.1 × 10−5.

ﬂux bin RXTE proposal P50067 and the Suzaku observation (i.e., the same
data as in Fig. 3) in the 15–30 keV band. The PCA data are shown in black
triangles, the HEXTE in red squares, and the PIN in blue stars. The CRSF
energy in the Suzaku observation is clearly higher than in the RXTE data.

It should be noted that in the phase-averaged Suzaku spectra,
the cutoff energy is very high compared to RXTE and relatively
close to the CRSF energy (18.6 keV for Ecut vs 22.7 keV for Ecyc).

MNRAS 000, 1–17 (2015)

The depth of the “smoothing” Gaussian added to compensate for
the piecewise nature of the plcut continuum is also quite high
compared to the RXTE values. This is likely in part due to the en-
ergy gap between the XIS and HXD/PIN spectra — if the smooth-
ing Gaussian is omitted entirely, the cutoff energy and CRSF en-
ergy are both found at nearly the same energy, at ∼ 21–22 keV.

There is no detectable correlation between Ecut and Ecyc in the
combined RXTE, INTEGRAL, and Suzaku datasets. However, Fig. 9
shows conﬁdence contours for Ecyc vs Ecut for Suzaku and the 123–
140 counts s−1 RXTE data, which is closest in ﬂux to the Suzaku
measurements; while the RXTE results are highly inconsistent with
Suzaku, the Suzaku contours are strangely shaped, with a notice-
able correlation between Ecyc and Ecut above Ecut ≈ 20 keV. This
correlation is likely artiﬁcial, due to the piecewise continuum; the
fact that the best-ﬁt value lies in the “spike” above the correlated
region suggests that the measured value can be trusted.

We can get some additional insight as to the difference be-
tween the Suzaku and RXTE spectra by examining different mod-
els and different datasets. Fitting the pulse-by-pulse and obsid-by-
obsid datasets with the fdcut continuum still ﬁnds a signiﬁcantly
higher Ecyc, at 22.8+0.5
−0.3, compared to ∼ 21.2 keV in RXTE. However,
the cutoff energy found with Suzaku using fdcut is still signif-
icantly higher than the RXTE measurement (26.5 ± 1.2 keV com-
pared to ∼ 22 keV in RXTE), and the conﬁdence contours in both
RXTE and Suzaku are not as well constrained as with the mplcut
continuum.

Figure 10. Ecut vs Ecyc contours for Suzaku and RXTE spectra of the peak
of the main pulse. Conﬁdence intervals are same as in Fig. 9.

The most interesting result is that of the phase-constrained
Suzaku spectrum of the peak of the main pulse, which does not suf-
fer from the same issues as the phase-averaged spectrum does —
using mplcut, its spectral parameters including Ecut are entirely
consistent with the RXTE values, with the exception of its CRSF
energy, which at 23.0+0.9
−0.8 is signiﬁcantly higher than the ∼ 20.9
found in the RXTE spectra. This can be seen clearly in the left-
hand panel of Fig. 7. Fig. 10 shows the Ecut-Ecyc contours for the
peak-pulse spectra; in this case Suzaku clearly ﬁnds a higher-energy
CRSF compared to RXTE. There is some bimodality in the contours
with a very slightly lower-energy CRSF at a signiﬁcantly higher
cutoff energy, but this is still a signiﬁcantly higher-energy CRSF
compared to RXTE. This raises the possibility that the increased
CRSF energy seen in the phase-averaged data is due primarily to
an increase in the CRSF energy in this phase bin. Indeed, the spec-
tra of the secondary pulse do not show any evolution of the CRSF
in time (see the right-hand panel of Fig. 7); this could be due to
a change in accretion geometry limited to a single pole. However,
it should be noted that the Suzaku spectrum of the secondary peak
has a very poorly-constrained cutoff energy.

6.1 Relationship between Ecyc and ﬂux

There are two generally recognized regimes for neutron star ac-
cretion, originally laid out by Basko & Sunyaev (1976), deﬁned by
the critical luminosity Lcrit. When accretion is supercritical, radia-
tion pressure is capable of stopping the infalling material entirely;
in this case, the accreted material sinks relatively slowly from a
radiation-dominated shock to the surface, and the observed X-rays
are mainly photons that escape through the sides of the column
(“fan-beam” emission), as the optical depth through the top of the
column is large. Under subcritical accretion, for luminosities sig-
niﬁcantly below Lcrit, the infalling material impacts on and heats
the surface (Zel’dovich & Shakura 1969), producing an accretion
mound and a hot spot at the magnetic pole; here, the observed X-
rays can escape from the top of the column (“pencil-beam” emis-
sion) due to the lower optical depth of the weaker accretion stream.
In the transition region between these two modes, when the accre-
tion is still subcritical but close to the critical point, the infalling
material is likely slowed by a combination of radiation pressure
and gas pressure, and the emission is a hybrid of the above two
modes.

Becker et al. (2012) and Poutanen et al. (2013) present two
very different mechanisms for CRSF production and variability.
Becker et al. (2012) has the CRSF being produced directly in the
accretion channel, and the observed correlations derive from the
line-producing region moving upwards (when accretion is super-
critical) or downwards (for moderately-subcritical accretion) in the
column in response to increases in accretion rate. In contrast, the
CRSF in the Poutanen et al. (2013) model is produced when light
from the accretion column, which is preferentially beamed down-
wards due to relativistic effects, reﬂects off the stellar surface, with
the CRSF energy determined by the surface magnetic ﬁeld strength
of the neutron star. Under supercritical accretion, the height of the
accretion column is proportional to the accretion rate, and thus
the observed Ecyc-luminosity anticorrelation results the taller col-
umn illuminating a larger fraction of the NS surface, sampling a
lower average magnetic ﬁeld (as the surface magnetic ﬁeld strength
drops as one moves away from the magnetic pole). Both mod-
els make similar qualitative predictions for the supercritical case,
but the reﬂection model inherently predicts smaller variations in
Ecyc, as the magnetic ﬁeld only varies by a factor of ∼ 2 over the
NS surface (compared to B ∝ r−3 in the higher reaches of the
column). While Poutanen et al. (2013) do not directly address the
subcritical-accretion case in their work, highly-subcritical sources
will emit their X-rays from a hot spot on the surface, and the reﬂec-
tion mechanism is not likely to produce strong variability in these
cases. Moderately-subcritical sources will still have something ap-
proximating an accretion column; for these cases, Mushtukov et al.
(2015b) point out that the velocity distribution of infalling electrons
will change as a source goes from highly-subcritical to moderately-
subcritical, with the electron velocity at the base of the accretion
channel reaching zero when the source reaches critical luminosity.
The change in the distribution of Doppler shifts between photons
and electrons as the source approaches Lcrit then results in the ob-
served positive trend between Ecyc and luminosity.

Assuming the NS mass and radius are 1 M⊙ (Rawls et al.
2011) and 10 km, respectively, and assuming spherical accretion,
the theoretical framework laid out by Becker et al. (2012) ﬁnds that
the effective Eddington luminosity, Lcrit, is 1.0 × 1036 erg s−1, some-
what lower than 4U 1538−522’s typical luminosity range of 3–10 ×
1036 erg s−1. One can adjust the predicted Lcrit up and down depend-

MNRAS 000, 1–17 (2015)

ing on the parameters one chooses; however, there is no physically-
reasonable set of parameters that results in 4U 1538−522 accreting
subcritically for more than a small fraction of its observed lumi-
nosity range — pushing Lcrit to above ∼ 5 × 1036 erg s−1 would re-
quire either assuming disk accretion or assuming that the surface
magnetic ﬁeld strength is signiﬁcantly higher than CRSF energy
predicts.

Thus, this implies that 4U 1538−522 accretes supercritically,
and we should thus expect a negative Ecyc-luminosity correlation.
This can only be reconciled with observations if the predicted
change in Ecyc is small enough to be hidden in the available data,
which, with some dependence on the dataset one looks at, con-
strains us to changes of ∼ 0.1 keV per 1036 erg s−1. Becker et al.
(2012) ﬁnd a linear relationship between luminosity and the height
of the CRSF-producing region for supercritical accretion, thus pre-
dicting a change in height by a factor of ∼ 3 for 4U 1538−522.
The exact height depends on the value of the ξ parameter from
Becker et al. (2012), which characterizes the relationship between
the ﬂow velocity of the accreted material and the effective “veloc-
ity” of photon diffusion upwards through the infalling material; tak-
ing ξ to be ∼ 10−2 results in emission heights of ∼ 10–30 m above
the NS surface. If one assumes a dipolar magnetic ﬁeld, this range
of heights corresponds to a change in the CRSF energy on the order
of 10−2–10−3 keV, far smaller than any observable trend. However,
the magnetic ﬁeld this close to the NS surface may deviate signif-
icantly from a dipole (see, e.g. Mukherjee & Bhattacharya 2012),
so this prediction should be viewed with some care.

More recent work by Mushtukov et al. (2015a) attempts to
additionally take into account resonant scattering and photon po-
larization. Their work ﬁnds that wind-accreting sources gener-
ally have higher Lcrit compared to disk-accreting sources, due to
the larger footprint of the accretion ﬂow. While they do not pro-
vide calculations for 4U 1538−522’s exact parameters, they do
ﬁnd Lcrit ≈ 2–4 × 1036 erg s−1 for wind-accreting sources around
4U 1538−522’s CRSF energy, intriguingly close to the ∼ 6 ×
1036 erg s−1 “break” in the Ecyc-luminosity relationship seen in the
obsid-by-obsid dataset. Mushtukov et al. (2015a) assume a neutron
star mass of 1.4 M⊙, while 4U 1538−522’s neutron star is likely
closer to ∼ 1 M⊙. A lower mass would result in a lower velocity for
infalling material, decreasing Lcrit, but would also increase the size
of the hot spot on the neutron star surface, decreasing the temper-
ature of the hot spot and increasing Lcrit. The overall effect here is
difﬁcult to judge, given the lack of a closed-form solution using the
framework of Mushtukov et al. (2015a).

There are a number of systematic factors that can inﬂuence
the calculated luminosity, which must be taken into account if we
are to compare our results to theoretical predictions. The uncer-
tainty in the distance to 4U 1538−522 is ∼ 1 kpc, corresponding to
at most a factor of ∼ 2 possible change in the measured luminosity;
if the distance is closer to Clark (2004)’s estimate of 4.5 kpc, our
observed luminosity range is closer to 1.5–4.5 × 1036 erg s−1. Rel-
ativistic lightbending and the non-isotropic emission of the X-ray
pulsar will also push the true luminosity down, since our luminos-
ity calculation assumes emission over 4π sr; when this beaming is
taken into account, the true luminosity can be a factor of ∼ 2 lower
compared to the computed luminosity, although this is highly de-
pendent on the emission geometry (M. Kühnel, private communi-
cation, 21 July 2015; Martínez-Núñez et al. 2015, in preparation).
Overall, though, the lack of any detectable trend, the weakness of
the predicted correlations, and the possible close proximity of the
scattering region to the NS surface make it prudent to say at this
stage that 4U 1538−522’s accretion mode is still uncertain.

6.2 Change in Ecyc between RXTE and Suzaku

The CRSF energy of 4U 1538−522 appears to have increased be-
tween the RXTE measurements of 1996–2004 and the 2012 Suzaku
measurement. This is a peculiar occurrence; while it does not seem
entirely attributable to instrumental or modeling artifacts, it may be
limited to the peak of the main pulse.

We plot all Ecyc measurements for 4U 1538−522 in Fig. 11.
Robba et al. (2001), analyzing the 1998 BeppoSAX observation of
4U 1538−522, found a phase-averaged CRSF energy of 21.1 ±
0.2 keV, entirely in line with the RXTE measurements from around
the same time. The BeppoSAX analysis used approximately the
same model choices as this analysis (plcut continuum and a
gauabs CRSF) and found the source at a roughly comparable lu-
minosity to the average RXTE luminosity. It is somewhat more dif-
ﬁcult to compare the results of the 1988 and 1990 Ginga observa-
tions (Clark et al. 1990; Mihara 1995), when the CRSF was discov-
ered, due to differences in model choice. The Clark et al. analysis
used a model consisting of a powerlaw modiﬁed by a cyclabs
component, where the second harmonic in the cyclabs model
effectively modeled the high-energy turnover that we model using
highecut. Mihara introduced the npex continuum model and
compared different CRSF models (see Table F.1.1 in Mihara 1995).
Using a Gaussian optical depth proﬁle for the CRSF, he found an
energy of 21.7 ± 0.3 keV (the usually quoted value is 20.6 keV, but
this uses the cyclabs model, where the ﬁtted energy does not
correspond to the peak energy of the CRSF). Applying the same
procedure as we used for the signiﬁcance of the Suzaku point, the
Ginga measurement sits above the RXTE average, but at only 2.1σ,
the separation is not as great as the RXTE-Suzaku split.

Currently, Her X-1 is the only source with conﬁrmed long-
term evolution in its CRSF independent of other observable fac-
tors (Staubert et al. 2014; Klochkov et al. 2015). Its CRSF behavior
with respect to time displays two main features: a sharp jump up-
wards by ∼ 4 keV in the early 1990s, followed by a ∼ 0.25 keV yr−1
decline since then. Additionally, a 2012 INTEGRAL observation
found a signiﬁcantly higher CRSF energy compared to the sur-
rounding Suzaku, INTEGRAL, and NuSTAR observations, indicat-
ing that signiﬁcant changes in the CRSF energy can occur on both
short and long timescales.

In 4U 1538−522’s case, the RXTE and BeppoSAX data are
bracketed by higher-energy measurements from Suzaku and Ginga.
The RXTE and BeppoSAX measurements alone cannot constrain
any trend with time; however, a linear ﬁt to the RXTE, Bep-
poSAX, INTEGRAL, and Suzaku measurements ﬁnds a slope of
0.058 ± 0.014 keV yr−1. However, the large uncertainties on the
INTEGRAL measurements make it impossible to say for certain
whether the Suzaku measurement represents a long-term trend or
merely a short-term increase in Ecyc.

It is highly unlikely that we are observing the evolution of the
neutron star’s intrinsic magnetic ﬁeld; rather, any long-term change
in the CRSF energy is likely due to a change in the properties of the
scattering region where the CRSF is produced. We have discussed
some of the properties of the scattering region above in Section
6.1; the question now is how one can produce a ∼ 1 keV shift in the
CRSF energy alongside minimal long-term changes in the source
ﬂux given the properties of the accretion ﬂow.

4U 1538−522 is a young system, as indicated by its high-mass
B0Iab companion and its strong magnetic ﬁeld, so it is unlikely that
accretion has been ongoing long enough to signiﬁcantly “bury” the
magnetic ﬁeld (in the sense outlined by Payne & Melatos 2004);
this burial process proceeds on far too long of a timescale to

masses of ∼ 10−12 M⊙ are likely sufﬁcient to distort the magnetic
ﬁeld signiﬁcantly. Based on the observed CRSF energy-luminosity
relationship as discussed in 6.1, the CRSF parameters are probably
a good probe of the environment around the polar cap, and a change
in the CRSF parameters could reﬂect some changes in the accretion
mound which might not be visible in other observables, such as lu-
minosity. For example, a slow growth in the mound’s height would
probably not affect the broad-band spectral parameters or luminos-
ity of 4U 1538−522 very much (the mound mainly contributes to
the black-body component of the spectrum, which is a small frac-
tion of the source’s overall luminosity; see e.g. Becker & Wolff
2007). However, relatively small changes in the mound’s height
can affect the magnetic ﬁeld in the mound quite drastically —
Mukherjee & Bhattacharya (2012) found that the magnetic ﬁeld
strength could deviate from the dipole strength by upwards of a
factor of four in the sides of sufﬁciently large accretion mounds.
A ∼ 5% increase in 4U 1538−522’s CRSF energy could be simply
due to a reconﬁguring of the mound geometry resulting in a slightly

stronger average ﬁeld strength. However, it is unclear as to whether
a 5–10 year timescale is realistic for this type of process. Also, as
pointed out above, it is unclear if the shift observed by Suzaku is
representative of a long-term change in the CRSF energy or if it is
more of a temporary effect.

There is the additional question of whether the change in the
CRSF energy is related to a change in only one of the accretion
columns, or if it is due to changes in both columns. The fact that the
changed CRSF energy is most prominent in the phase-constrained
data from the peak of the main pulse and not detected in the sec-
ondary pulse suggests that this effect may be limited to a single
magnetic pole. Given the possible mechanisms laid out above, this
is not an unreasonable thing to suggest — there is no fundamental
reason that the two poles’ accretion structures should move in lock-
step with each other; a difference of a few percent in the two poles
is conceivable.

Finally, it is interesting to note here that the source under-
went torque reversals in ∼ 1990 (Rubin et al. 1997) and ∼ 2008
(Hemphill et al. 2013; Finger et al. 2009), intriguingly close to
bracketing the RXTE and BeppoSAX observations and separating
them somewhat from the higher-energy Ginga and Suzaku mea-
surements. For an accreting neutron star, the evolution of the spin
period is driven by the torque exerted on the neutron star’s mag-
netic ﬁeld by the accreted material; thus it is reasonable to say that
a shift in the properties of the magnetic ﬁeld could be associated
with changes in the pulse period evolution. Unfortunately, there is
no spectrally-sensitive coverage of either torque reversal; the best
we can do is look at the INTEGRAL results of (Hemphill et al.
2013), which found no signiﬁcant changes on either side of the
2008 torque reversal. However, INTEGRAL’s relative spectral in-
sensitivity means there is ample room for smaller changes. The
RXTE All-Sky Monitor (Levine et al. 1996) shows no detectable
changes in ﬂux in this time, although 4U 1538−522 is very dim
in the ASM — rebinning the ASM lightcurve to the 3.74 d orbital
period, the counting rate is 0.7 ± 0.8 cts s−1 — and as such we can-
not place any strong limits on source variability across the torque
reversal based on the ASM lightcurve.

7 CONCLUSION

We have performed a comprehensive analysis of ∼ 15 years of X-
ray observations of the high-mass X-ray binary 4U 1538−522, us-
ing data from the RXTE, Suzaku, and INTEGRAL satellites. Spec-
trally, the source is relatively stable, with the continuum parame-
ters remaining mostly ﬂat with respect to changes in luminosity.
The main results are the lack of a signiﬁcant correlation between
the centroid energy of the fundamental CRSF and the increase
by ∼ 1 keV in the CRSF energy between the RXTE and Suzaku
observations. The lack of a detectable correlation between the
CRSF energy and luminosity is supported by theoretical work by
Becker et al. (2012), Poutanen et al. (2013), and Mushtukov et al.
(2015a), although there is some uncertainty as to exactly what the-
oretical scenario is being played out. The time-dependence of the
CRSF is a less easily understood issue and requires additional work
to, ﬁrst, conﬁrm or deny its reality and second, produce a reliable
explanation for the phenomenon. An upcoming INTEGRAL cam-
paign will help shed some light on the ﬁrst point, but what are truly
needed are observations by more spectrally-sensitive instruments,
e.g. those aboard NuSTAR or Astro-H, which will be able to make
a precise measurement of the CRSF energy.
