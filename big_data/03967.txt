(Dated: 15th March 2016)

A relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory with nontrivial background ﬁelds is developed and applied
to study waves in plasmas. The eﬀective action of the electromagnetic 4-potential is calculated ab
initio from the standard action of scalar QED using path integrals. The resultant eﬀective action is
gauge invariant and contains nonlocal interactions, from which gauge bosons acquire masses without
breaking the local gauge symmetry. To demonstrate how the general theory can be applied, we study
a cold unmagnetized plasma and a cold uniformly magnetized plasma. Using these two examples, we
show that all linear waves well-known in classical plasma physics can be recovered from relativistic
quantum results when taking the classical limit.
In the opposite limit, classical wave dispersion
relations are modiﬁed substantially. In unmagnetized plasmas, longitudinal waves propagate with
nonzero group velocities even when plasmas are cold. In magnetized plasmas, anharmonically spaced
Bernstein waves persist even when plasmas are cold. These waves account for cyclotron absorption
features observed in spectra of X-ray pulsars. Moreover, cutoﬀ frequencies of the two non-degenerate
electromagnetic waves are redshifted by diﬀerent amounts. These corrections need to be taken into
account in order to correctly interpret diagnostic results in laser plasma experiments.

INTRODUCTION

Classical plasma theories, which describe plasmas as
collections of charged classical particles moving in self-
consistent electromagnetic (EM) ﬁelds, become deﬁcient
when relativistic and quantum eﬀects are important. The
conditions at which relativistic quantum eﬀects are im-
portant may be determined by comparing three energy
scales: the energy scales of the plasmas, the energy scales
of the EM ﬁelds, and the rest energy of charged particles.
The energy scales of plasmas are the thermal energy kBT ,
the Fermi energy F, and the plasmon energy ωp. The
energy scales of wave ﬁelds are the photon energy ω
and the ponderomotive energy Up. The energy scales
eEc
of static electric and magnetic ﬁelds are E =
eBc2, respectively. Relativistic eﬀects are
and B =
important when the energy scales of either the plasmas
or the EM ﬁelds are comparable to the rest energy of
charged particles. Quantum eﬀects are important when
the thermal energy is low compared to other energy
scales.

An example where relativistic quantum eﬀects are im-
portant is the magnetosphere of an X-ray pulsar [1]. The
typical magnetic ﬁelds of X-ray pulsars are on the or-
der B ∼ 1012 G. The corresponding magnetic energy
B ∼ 100 KeV is comparable to the rest energy of elec-
trons mec2 ≈ 511 KeV, indicating that relativistic eﬀects
are important. Moreover, the eﬀective temperature of X-
ray pulsars kBT ∼ 10 KeV is colder than B, indicating
that quantum eﬀects are also important. That relativ-
istic quantum eﬀects are important, an inference made by
comparing energy scales, is strongly supported by anhar-
monic cyclotron absorption features observed in spectra
of X-ray pulsars [2–7]. Since classical plasma theories

cannot explain these spectral features, the presence of
high order harmonics is attributed to inelastic scatterings
of photons with electrons that occupy quantized Landau
levels [8], and the anharmonicity is attributed to viewing
geometry as well as relativistic eﬀects [9, 10]. Despite
numerous eﬀorts, many features of cyclotron absorption
lines remain to be explained [11–13]. The locations and
shapes of these lines contain important information such
as the magnetic ﬁeld and plasma proﬁles of magneto-
spheres of X-ray pulsars. This information cannot be
extracted, unless wave dispersion relations, which enter
the radiation transport equations [1] that serve as the
forward model in the retrieval problem [14], are obtained
for strongly magnetized plasmas. In this paper, we will
obtain, for the ﬁrst time, explicit expressions of wave dis-
persion relations in strongly magnetized plasmas.

Another example where relativistic quantum eﬀects are
important is a plasma produced by ultra intense lasers
interacting with a solid target. During the interaction,
a quasistatic magnetic ﬁeld on gigagauss scale can be
produced [15, 16]. The corresponding magnetic energy
B ∼ 1 KeV is comparable to the electron temperature
of the plasma, indicating that quantum eﬀects are im-
portant. Relativistic eﬀects also turn out to be important
when optical lasers are used to diagnose the plasma. This
is because the frequencies of optical photons are close to
wave cutoﬀs, if the plasma has density n0 ∼ 1021 cm−3,
corresponding to ωp ∼ 1 eV. Due to singularities near
cutoﬀs, small modiﬁcations of the cutoﬀ frequencies can
have large eﬀects. Such eﬀects have been revealed in a
number of experiments [17, 18]. In these experiments, it
is found that the magnetic ﬁeld, determined from clas-
sical formulas, is larger when the same plasma is dia-
gnosed by lasers with higher frequencies. This peculiar
dependence of the inferred magnetic ﬁeld strength on the
frequencies of diagnostic lasers indicates that systematic
errors exist in classical formulas. These systematic errors

can be removed only by carefully calculating how waves
propagate in strongly magnetized plasmas. In this paper,
we will describe, for the ﬁrst time, how Faraday rotation
is modiﬁed by relativistic quantum eﬀects.

To describe wave propagation in strongly magnetized
plasmas, as well as in other plasmas where relativistic
quantum eﬀects are important, we develop a general the-
ory that can be applied to various situations. The gen-
eral theory, which is based on the concept of eﬀective
action in quantum ﬁeld theory, describes wave propaga-
tion through possibly nonthermal scalar QED plasmas in
background EM ﬁelds. The wave eﬀective action has a
clear physical meaning. When waves propagate through
plasmas, they interact with charged particles, whose dy-
namics are aﬀected by the presence of the background
ﬁelds as well as the wave ﬁelds. After all the interac-
tions related to charged particles are summed up, what
remains is the eﬀective action of waves. This clear phys-
ical picture of the wave eﬀective action can be trans-
lated into rigorous mathematical procedures. To derive
the eﬀective action, we start from the standard action of
scalar QED, self-consistently factor out the background
ﬁelds from the ﬂuctuating ﬁelds, and then integrate out
the charged particle ﬁelds in the path integral perturbat-
ively. We shall see that at the 1-loop level, the eﬀective
action is related to the linear response of the system to
small amplitude waves.

Having developed the general theory, we demonstrate
how it can be applied using two examples. The ﬁrst ex-
ample is a uniform, unmagnetized, boson plasma. Such
a system has been studied by a number of authors us-
ing other methods [19, 20]. Results of our general the-
ory agree with these authors’ in this special case. The
second example is a uniform, magnetized, boson plasma.
Such a system has been studied by Witte and coauthors
[21–23], who can only describe wave propagation paral-
lel to the background magnetic ﬁeld. Our results agree
in this special case. Moreover, our transparent formalism
also enables us to describe nonparallel wave propagation,
which was obscure in previous studies. Although many
theories and models have been developed in the literature
to describe waves in relativistic quantum plasmas, such
as plasma response theories [24, 25], ﬁnite temperature
theories [26–28], quantum hydrodynamic models [29, 30],
and models that are based on the historical Heisenberg-
Euler eﬀective Lagrangian [31–35], this is the ﬁrst theory
capable of demonstrating its correctness by showing that
all linear wave modes well-known in classical plasma the-
ories can be recovered when taking the classical limit1 in
relativistic quantum results.

Beyond the immediate goal of establishing a formalism
that describes wave propagation in relativistic quantum
plasmas, the goal of this paper is to demonstrate that
quantum ﬁeld theory, in whose language the standard
model of particle physics is written, and in whose lan-

2

guage many phenomena in condensed matter physics are
explained, is also an eﬀective language for plasma phys-
ics. Since particle physics describes a few particles with
high energy, condensed matter physics describes many
particles with low energy, and plasma physics describes
intermediate number of particles with intermediate en-
ergy, it should not be surprising that a language that is
eﬀective for both extremes is also eﬀective in the interme-
diate regime. In this paper, we study scalar QED, which
describes spin-0 bosons, instead of spinor QED, which
describes spin-1/2 fermions, so that our main ideas can
be illustrated without complications due to spins. Al-
though plasmas are typically made of spinor particles in-
stead of scalar particles, scalar QED can be a good model
for many condensed matter systems like superconductors
and superﬂuids [36]. Moreover, our scalar QED plasma
theory does recover waves in classical plasma theories,
which typically take no account of spins at all. Extension
of our formalism to spinor QED plasmas is straightfor-
ward and will be reported separately.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Sec.
II, the general theory of wave propagation in scalar QED
plasmas is presented. In Sec. III, we evaluate the wave
eﬀective action in unmagnetized plasmas and obtain lin-
ear wave modes in a cold plasma. In Sec. IV, an explicit
expression of the wave eﬀective action in a cold and uni-
formly magnetized plasma is obtained, followed by ana-
lysis of linear wave modes. Conclusions and discussion
are made in Sec. V. Some important mathematical de-
tails are given in the Appendices.

II. GENERAL THEORY

A. Quantum ﬁeld theory with background ﬁelds

Our starting point is the standard action of scalar
QED,
in which a complex scalar ﬁeld is coupled to
the gauge ﬁeld through minimum coupling. In natural
unit 0 =  = c = 1 and Minkowski metric gµν =
diag(1,−1,−1,−1), the standard scalar QED action is

The complex scalar ﬁeld φ, whose complex conjugate is
denoted as φ∗, describes charged spin-0 bosons with mass
m and charge2 e. The real-valued 1-form A = Aµdxµ is
the gauge ﬁeld that deﬁnes the gauge covariant derivative
Dµ = ∂µ − ieAµ. The covariant derivative has curvature
2-form Fµν = ∂µAν − ∂νAµ, known as the ﬁeld strength

1 The classical regime is mc2 (cid:29) pc (cid:29) , where m is the rest mass,
p is the momentum, and  is the quantized energy of a particle.

2 In natural unit, the electron charge e = −|e| is a dimensionless
small number related to the ﬁne-structure constant α = e2/4π ≈
1/137. We denote es the charge of particle states of species s, so
the charge of anti-particle states is −es.

tensor. The φ4 interaction is necessary for the theory to
be renormalizable, and the self-coupling constant λ is in
general nonzero. But to 1-loop level, λ does not contrib-
ute to the propagation of gauge bosons. For simplicity,
we set the renormalized value of λ to zero from now on.
It is well-known that the Lagrangian density of action (1)
is invariant under local U(1)-gauge transformation

φ → φeieχ, Aµ → Aµ + ∂µχ,

(2)

where χ is any function. The gauge invariant symmetry
current is

J µ =

e
i

[φ∗(Dµφ) − φ(Dµφ)∗].

(3)

Contributions by other charged species are additive to
the current as well as to the Lagrangian. For concise-
ness, we will not write summations over charged species
explicitly.

To describe plasmas, which are constituted of charged
particles and their self-consistent EM ﬁelds, let us ﬁrst
understand the roles of background ﬁelds in quantum
ﬁeld theory.
In the usual quantum ﬁeld theory, ﬁelds
ﬂuctuate near their vacuum expectation values. The cre-
ation and annihilation of energy momentum quanta are
always accompanied by the creation and annihilation of
particles. However, when ﬁelds ﬂuctuate near some non-
vacuum backgrounds, these two types of ﬂuctuations be-
come orthogonal. Energy momentum quanta can be cre-
ated and annihilated without changing the number of
particles in a system, and the number of particles can
be altered without changing the total energy and mo-
mentum of the system. This idea is illustrated in Fig. 1.
Mathematically, the ﬁelds φ and A can be decomposed
into classical backgrounds and quantum ﬂuctuations

φ = φ0 + ϕ, Aµ = ¯Aµ + Aµ.

(4)

Vacuum is the trivial case when the background ﬁelds φ0
and ¯A are zero. When the background ﬁelds are non-
trivial, the self-consistency of the classical backgrounds
is given by the Euler−Lagrange equations

( ¯Dµ ¯Dµ + m2)φ0 = 0,

∂µ ¯F µν = ¯J ν

(5)
In the above equations, ¯Dµ = ∂µ − ie ¯Aµ is the back-
ground gauge covariant derivative, ¯Fµν = ∂µ ¯Aν − ∂ν ¯Aµ
¯J ν
is the background ﬁeld strength tensor, and ¯J ν
s0
is the total background current, summed over all charged
species. It is clear that the above equations are invariant
under the background U(1)-gauge transformation on φ0
and ¯A. The classical equations of motion (5) describe
bound states as well as unbound states. When the po-
tential energy is larger than the kinetic energy, as is the
case in condensed matter systems, particles are bound
by the potential created by other particles. In this case,
the wave functions φ0 and ¯A are localized and interac-
tions between particles can be strong. On the other hand,
when the kinetic energy is larger than the potential en-
ergy, as is the case in plasmas, particles are unbound.

FIG. 1. Comparison between ﬁeld theory in the vacuum and
ﬁeld theory with dynamical backgrounds. When a ﬁeld φ(x)
ﬂuctuates near the vacuum (a), energy and momentum ﬂuc-
tuations are always accompanied by density ﬂuctuations. On
the other hand, when the ﬁeld ﬂuctuates near some non-
vacuum background (b), energy and momentum ﬂuctuations
can be orthogonal to density ﬂuctuations.

In this case, the motion of one particle is weakly correl-
ated with the motion of other particles, except during
collisions.

While the background EM ﬁeld ¯Fµν is conceptually
simple, the background charged particle ﬁeld φ0 needs
some clariﬁcations. When the plasma background is con-
stituted of N bosons, the classical background ﬁeld φ0(x)
is formally related to the properly symmetrized N-body
wave function Φ0(x1, x2, . . . , xN ) by

(cid:90) √

φ0(x) =

V Φ0(x, x2, . . . , xN ).

(6)

√

Here V = d4x2 ∧ ··· ∧ d4xN is the volume form of
the 4(N − 1) dimensional subspace space of the N-
boson conﬁguration space. The half-form
V is com-
monly seen in geometric quantization [37]. It is easy to
check that the N-body wave function has mass dimen-
sion [Φ0(x1, . . . , xN )] = M 2N−1 and the ﬁeld φ0(x) has
mass dimension [φ0(x)] = M as expected. When a pair
φ0(x)φ∗
0(x) appears in an expression, two half-forms com-
bine into the volume form, and the integration can then
be carried out. For example, the current ¯J µ
0 of an N -body
wave function Φ0 can be written explicit as

¯J µ
0 (x) =

e
i

V [Φ∗

0(x, x2...) ¯Dµ(x)Φ0(x, x2...) − c.c.]. (7)

For conciseness, whenever the pair φ0(x)φ∗
0(x) appears
in an expression, integration over all other coordinates
of x2, . . . of the many-body wave function Φ0(x, x2, . . . )
will be implied.

Having clariﬁed the roles of background ﬁelds, let us
study their eﬀects in quantum ﬁeld theory. Separate
classical backgrounds from quantum ﬂuctuations using
decomposition (4), integrate by part using

are currents due to vacuum excitation and background
plasma excitation, respectively.
The background-reduced action (9) is associated with
a Lagrangian density L that depends on the ﬂuctuating
ﬁelds ϕ and A. When waves propagate through back-
ground plasmas, the background ﬁeld ¯Fµν, which is usu-
ally generated by some slowly-varying and large-scale ex-
ternal charge current distributions, can be regarded as
ﬁxed. The background charged particle ﬁeld φ0, which
is self-consistent with ¯Fµν, can also be regarded as ﬁxed.
In this way, all interactions between waves and charged
particles are taken into account by the ﬂuctuating ﬁelds.

Here Lϕ, LA, and LI correspond to terms on the second,
the third, and the fourth line, respectively. Lϕ is the
Lagrangian density of the free ϕ ﬁeld. It should be cla-
riﬁed that ϕ is not free in the sense that its dynamics is
inﬂuenced by the background ﬁeld ¯A, as is manifested by
the background gauge covariant derivative ¯D acting on
ϕ. But ϕ is nevertheless free in the sense that it neither
interacts with A nor couples to itself. Similarly, LA is
the Lagrangian density of the free A ﬁeld. Notice that
the background ﬁeld φ0 endows the gauge ﬁeld A with a
mass term that can have spatial and temporal depend-
ences. Finally, the interaction Lagrangian LI contains
interactions between ϕ and A. Some interactions only
involve the ﬂuctuating ﬁelds ϕ and A with constant coup-
lings. These interactions happen in plasmas as well as in
the vacuum. Other interactions involve the background
ﬁelds φ0 and ¯A in the coupling. These interactions do not
happen unless nontrivial background ﬁelds are present.

The Lagrangian density (12) has a number of gauge
symmetries. It is obvious that the Lagrangian is invariant
under background local U(1)-gauge transformation
¯Aµ → ¯Aµ + ∂µχ.

φ0 → φ0eieχ, ϕ → ϕeieχ,

(13)

4

It is less obvious but equally true that once the back-
ground ﬁelds φ0 and ¯A are ﬁxed the Lagrangian is in-
variant under the following transformation

Aµ → Aµ + ∂µχ, ϕ → ϕeieχ + φ0(eieχ − 1).

(14)

This can be understood intuitively from Fig. 1 as follows.
The local U(1)-gauge transformation (2) is a shift in A
and a phase rotation in φ. When ¯A is ﬁxed the shift is
completely absorbed into A. When φ0 is ﬁxed ϕ has to
transform by Eq. (14) in order to preserve the norm of
φ. The symmetry current is

J µ = ¯µ + ¯ηµ − 2e2φφ∗Aµ.

(15)
This gauge invariant current J contains contributions
from excitations of the background ﬁelds as well as ex-
citations of the vacuum.

B. Eﬀective action of gauge bosons

So far, no approximation has been made, and the Lag-
rangian density (12) is exact. The Lagrangian density
describes the free ϕ ﬁeld, the free A ﬁeld, and their in-
teractions. When the gauge ﬁeld A propagates, it in-
teracts with charged particles and becomes dressed by
these interactions. After summing up all these dressings,
the eﬀective action, which describes the propagation of
the dressed A ﬁeld, can be obtained. The summation of
dressings can be rigorously implemented using the path
integral3, which can be evaluated perturbatively using
the small dimensionless coupling constant e as an expan-
sion parameter.
Formally, the exponentiated eﬀective action eiΓ[A] of
the A ﬁeld is the partially evaluated quantum partition
function4 when the ϕ ﬁeld is integrated out. To integrate
out the ϕ ﬁeld, we will need to expand the action expo-
nential eiS, the quantum equivalence of the Boltzmann
factor, and it is convenient to group terms in the inter-
and A. Schematically, we can write

action SI = (cid:82) d4xLI according to their powers in e, ϕ,

SI = SeϕA + Seϕ2A + Se2ϕA2 + Se2ϕ2A2.

(16)
Denote the action of the free ϕ ﬁeld and the free A ﬁeld by
Sϕ and SA, respectively. Expand the action exponential
to e2 order and use properties of Gaussian integrals to
eliminate terms that contain odd powers of ϕ in the path

3 The path integral is one way of quantizing the ﬁeld theory. It
superimposes all possible ﬁeld conﬁgurations weighted by the
phase factor eiS/

.

4 The quantum partition function serves a similar role as the stat-
istical partition function.
In the statistical case, the average
is weighted by the Boltzmann factor e−H/kBT , while in the
quantum case, the average is weighted by the phase factor eiS/
.

function of the free ϕ ﬁeld. The term Seϕ2A is linear
in A.
It serves as the source term that is responsible
for the emission, absorption and scattering of gauge bo-
sons. Since our focus is wave propagation, we will not be
concerned with this term in this paper. The remaining
terms in the expansion (17) are quadratic in A and they
are responsible for the propagation of the gauge ﬁeld.

To express the eﬀective action in a more illuminat-
ing form, we can write terms in the above expansion in
terms of quantities that are familiar in quantum ﬁeld the-
ory. The ﬁrst quantity is the propagator, or the Green’s
function, of the free ϕ ﬁeld

The Green’s function is a 2-point quantum correlation
function.
It is the probability amplitude of creating a
charged particle at one location and then annihilating
this particle at another location. The Green’s function
of the free ϕ ﬁeld appears from Se2ϕ2A2 after evaluating
the path integral (17). The second quantity is the gauge
invariant polarization tensor Πµν(x, x(cid:48)). Use properties
of Gaussian integrals to integrate out the A ﬁeld5, we
can evaluate the exact polarization tensor as

scattered, namely, the gauge boson is ﬁrst absorbed after
exciting a plasma particle and then get re-emitted by

4FµνF µν after
of the eﬀective action (20) is the same as 1
integration by part. This is the action of the A ﬁeld in
the vacuum. The second line is a nonlocal term that de-
pends on two coordinates x and x(cid:48). This term describes
the dressing of the A ﬁeld due to its interactions with the
background plasma and the vacuum.

the path integrals in (19). For conciseness, we will ab-
breviate 1-point functions by ϕ(x) = ϕ, ϕ(x(cid:48)) = ϕ(cid:48), and
so on. Similarly, we will abbreviate 2-point functions by
G(x, x(cid:48)) = G, G(x, x(cid:48)) = G(cid:48), and so on. It is useful to
note the following properties of the path integrals. First,
since Lϕ is quadratic in ϕϕ∗, using properties of Gaus-
sian integrals, we know (cid:104)ϕϕ(cid:48)(cid:105)ϕ = (cid:104)ϕ∗ϕ(cid:48)∗(cid:105)ϕ = 0. Second,
due to the imaginary exponential eiS, we have G∗ = −G(cid:48).

Expressions (20)-(25) combined give an explicit formula
of the eﬀective action of gauge ﬁeld propagation to order
e2 in the most general setting. Since the e2-order eﬀective
action contains Feynman diagrams up to the 1-loop level,
the e2-order eﬀective action is the same as the 1-loop
eﬀective action.

Having obtained the formula of the 1-loop eﬀective ac-
tion, it is worth pointing out a number of symmetries
and conservation properties that the eﬀective action has.
First, the 1-loop eﬀective action is manifestly Lorentz in-
variant. Second, it is easy to check that the 1-loop eﬀect-
ive action is invariant under the background U(1)-gauge
transformation (13), under which the Green’s function
G(x, x(cid:48)) is transformed by

G(x, x(cid:48)) → eieχ(x)G(x, x(cid:48))e−ieχ(x(cid:48)).

(26)

This property guarantees that the eﬀective action is inde-
pendent of the choice of the background gauge. So one is
free to choose a background gauge that is convenient for
calculations. Finally, the 1-loop eﬀective action is invari-
ant under local gauge transformation of the ﬂuctuating
gauge ﬁeld Aµ → Aµ + ∂µχ. Use the Schwinger-Dyson
equation of the Green’s function

[ ¯Dµ(x) ¯Dµ(x) + m2]G(x, x(cid:48)) = −iδ(x − x(cid:48)),

together with properties of the δ−function

f (x)∂µδ(x) = −δ(x)∂µf (x),

After integration by part, it is clear that the eﬀective
action is invariant under the local gauge transformation
of the A ﬁeld. Identities (29) and (30) indicate that the
plasma current and the vacuum current are conserved
separately, so the plasma contribution to wave propaga-
tion is separable from the vacuum contribution.

In the above discussion, we obtain the eﬀective action
in the conﬁguration space. Sometimes it is more conveni-
ent to work in the momentum space, which is related to
the conﬁguration space by Fourier transforms

where the dispersion tensor

2 (k) = Λνµ(−k).

(38)

For given background ﬁelds φ0 and ¯A, the dispersion
tensor Λµν(k) is a function of the wave 4-momentum kµ.

C. Observables of eﬀective action

When there is no external source, the classical equation
of motion of ˆA(k) is Λµν(k) ˆAν(k) = 0. The nontrivial
solutions are plane waves whose wave 4-momentum k
satisﬁes det Λµν(k) = 0. The property kµΛµν(k) = 0
guarantees that one eigenvalue of Λµν is trivial. In fact,
using the Ward−Takahashi identity and performing ele-
mentary row and column operations, it is easy to show
that the temporal components of the dispersion tensor
(38) can be eliminated by matrix similarity. Hence, the
wave dispersion relations are given by

det Λij(k) = 0,

(39)

where Λij is the spatial block of the dispersion tensor. In
general, the 3-by-3 matrix Λij has three nontrivial eigen-
values, giving relativistic covariant dispersion relations of
three waves.

When there is some external test current ˆJ µ

ext(k), the
equation of ˆA(k) is Λµν(k) ˆAν(k) = ˆJ µ
ext(k). After gauge
ﬁxing, the solution to this inhomogeneous equation is of
the form

ˆA = Λ−1 ˆJext.

(40)

Taking inverse Fourier transform, the linear response of
A(x) to the external test current Jext(x) can be found.
For example, when placing a test charge in the plasma
J µ
ext(x) = eδ(3)(x)(1, 0, 0, 0), one can derive screening in
the relativistic quantum plasma.

Finally, it is worth pointing out that the conﬁguration
space response tensor Σ = Σr +iΣi is in general complex,
corresponding to the momentum space response tensor
ˆΣ = ˆΣH + i ˆΣA that contains an antihermitian part. In
classical ﬁeld theory, when one solves the dispersion rela-
tion (39) with Σi (cid:54)= 0, the wave 4-momentum kµ is neces-
sarily complex. So the amplitude of a plane wave either
changes in time in an initial value problem, or changes in
space in a boundary value problem. In the quantized ﬁeld
theory, the wave 4-momentum kµ is always real, and it
is the number of gauge bosons that change when Σi (cid:54)= 0.
By the famous optical theorem, the imaginary part Σi is
proportional to the total cross section of the gauge bo-
In fact, the optical theorem can be derived from
son.
the action exponential as follows.
In the conﬁguration
space, we can separate the exponentiated action into an
oscillatory part and an exponential part:

eiΓ = eiA(∇+Σ)A = eiA(∇+Σr)Ae−AΣiA.

(41)

When Σi = 0, the exponential is purely oscillatory. This
corresponds to the simple propagation of the gauge ﬁeld.
When Σi > 0, namely, when the matrix is positive def-
inite, the exponential decays. This corresponds to wave
damping in the classical theory, and the decay or ab-
sorption of gauge bosons in the quantized theory. When
Σi < 0, namely, when the matrix is negative deﬁnite,
the exponential grows. This corresponds to instabilities
in the classical theory, and the production or emission
of gauge bosons in the quantized theory. Finally, when
the matrix Σi is indeﬁnite, some eigenmodes grow while
others decay. In this case, a state of A ﬁeld can convert
from one mode to another mode as it propagates.

to choose the vacuum gauge

¯A = 0

(42)

In this case, the equation of motion of φ0 reduces to
the Klein-Gordon equation in its simplest form.
It is
well-known that the single-boson solution to the Klein-
Gordon equation is plane waves with the dispersion re-
lation p2 = pµpµ = m2. Since particles are not conﬁned,

7

the background wave functions are not square integrable.
To deal with an inﬁnitely large plasma with ﬁnite dens-
ity, it is helpful to ﬁrst think of a periodic spatial box
with size L and a temporal box of length T that contains
N particles, and then take the limit that L, T → ∞ while
keeping the density n0 = N/L3 ﬁxed. Inside the box, the
properly normalized single-boson wave function

a single particle.

To see how to deal with an inﬁnitely large plasma, let
us calculate current density of N bosons contained in a

act weakly with each other. To lowest order, the plasma
may be approximated as a collection of noninteracting
particles. Suppose the N bosons occupy M orthogonal

dk = M for k = N − NM + 1, . . . , N . After carrying out

followed by summations and integrations over the Hilbert
space of single-boson states.

Besides the wave functions, we will also need the

For path integrals to converge, one needs to replace
m2 → m2 − i0 in the exponentiated action. This gives
a prescription of the integration contour around poles in
the complex plane when evaluating the integral in Eq.
(48). The resultant Green’s function is the Feynman
Green’s function.

The vacuum response when ¯A = 0 is also well-known.

On the ﬁrst line, Γ(z) is the gamma function, which di-
verges when z equals to nonpositive integers. To obtain
the second equality, the limit d → 4 is taken, followed
by integration over the Feynman parameter u. It is not
hard to see that ˆΣ2,vac(k2) is real when k2 = kµkµ ≤ 4m2,
and ˆΣ2,vac(k2) becomes complex with a positive imagin-
ary part when k2 > 4m2. The positive imaginary part is
proportional to the cross section of a gauge boson, which
can decay into a pair of charged particle and antiparticle
when k2 > 4m2.

Similar results are shown by Melrose [24] using the pre-
scription of cutting one charged particle propagator in
the vacuum polarization diagrams and replacing it by
statistical average over the plasma. Our formulation has
thus provided a justiﬁcation for such a prescription.

Let us consider the example of a cold particle plasma.
Denote the 4-momentum of plasma particles by qµ, then
the density of state

ρ(p) = n0(2π)3δ(3)(p − q)δ,1 ,

(53)

where n0 is the number density of the plasma. Because of
the δ-functions, integrals and summations can be carried
out very easily. The current density due to each charged
species becomes

¯J µ
0 (x) = en0qµ/m.

(54)

This is what one would expect of a cold uniform ﬂuid. To
satisfy the background self-consistency ∂µ ¯F µν = 0, the
plasma needs to be constituted of more than one charged
species, such that the total current ¯J µ
0 = 0 when summed
over all charged species. Using the density of state (53),

D. Wave dispersion relations

Having found the response tensors due to the vacuum
(50) and the cold plasma (57), we can proceed to ﬁnd
dispersion relations. The simplest case is when diﬀer-
ent charged species in the plasma have no relative mo-
tion.
In this case, there is an inertial frame in which
all background particles are at rest. In this plasma rest
frame, the particle 4-momentum qµ = (m, 0, 0, 0). Let us
choose a coordinate system such that wave 4-momentum
kµ = (ω, k, 0, 0). In this coordinate system, the nonzero
components of the plasma response tensor are6

are the plasma frequency and the plasma susceptibility,
respectively.

Using elementary column and row operations, the dis-
persion matrix Λµν can be diagonalized and the eigen-
value problem can be solved. There are two transverse
modes and one longitudinal mode. The two transverse
modes are degenerate and electromagnetic with the dis-
persion relation

(1 + χv)(ω2 − k2) − ω2

p = 0.

(60)

From this dispersion relation, it is easy to see that the
photon modes are gapped when background plasmas ex-
ist. Namely, the wave frequency ω (cid:54)= 0 when the wave
vector k = 0 if ωp (cid:54)= 0 . The longitudinal mode is elec-
trostatic with the dispersion relation

1 + χv + χp = 0.

(61)

Since χp(k = 0) = −ω2
p/ω2, there always exist one
gapped plasmon mode, known classically as the Lang-
muir wave. When there are two or more charged species,
there also exists a gapless phonon mode, known classic-
ally as the ion acoustic wave.

An example of wave dispersion relations in a cold,
quasineutral, spinless, electron-ion plasma is plotted in
Fig. 2. In the ﬁgure, the upper curves are the degener-
ate EM waves, the middle curves are the Langmuir waves,

6 We use the italics k for 4-momentum of and the roman k = |k|
for the magnitude of the wave vector. While k2 = kµkµ and
kq = kµqµ denote the Minkowski inner products, k2 and ωk are
products of scalars.

FIG. 2. Wave dispersion relations in a cold, unmagnetized,
quasineutral, spinless, electron-ion plasma. For various ef-
fects to be visible on the scale of this ﬁgure, parameters used
for making this plot are 2e2/3(4π)2 = 20, me/ωpe = 5, and
mi/me = 3. The solid black curves are the 1-loop dispersion
relations. The solid red curves are the dispersion relations
that ignore the vacuum polarization. The dashed black curves
are wave dispersion relations in a classical plasma. The upper
curves are the electromagnetic waves, the middle curves are
the Langmuir waves, the bottom curves are the ion acoustic
waves, and the dashed gray line across the diagonal represents
the light cone. Notice that near the light cone, wave disper-
sion relations in the relativistic quantum plasma asymptote
to wave dispersion relations in the classical plasma.

and the lower curves are the ion acoustic waves. There
also exist high energy solutions with ω > 2m. These high
energy modes readily decay and are not plotted here. In
Fig. 2, the solid black curves are the 1-loop dispersion
relations solved from (60) and (61). The red curves are
wave dispersion relations when the vacuum polarization
χv is ignored. The dashed black curves are wave dis-
persion relations in a classical plasma. In this example,
we set the plasma density high with ωpe/me = 0.2, such
that relativistic quantum eﬀects are visible on the scale
of this ﬁgure. We set the ions mass low with mi/me = 3,
such that ion eﬀects are comparable to electron eﬀects.
The coupling constant is taken to be unphysically strong
2e2/3(4π)2 = 20, such that vacuum eﬀects are compar-
able to plasma eﬀects on the scale of this ﬁgure. As can
be seen from the ﬁgure, wave dispersion relations in the
relativistic quantum plasma are very similar to those in
the classical plasma near the light cone. However, there
are clearly distinctions away from the light cone. In par-
ticular, unlike classical plasma theories, the relativistic
quantum theory predicts that longitudinal waves propag-
ate with nonzero group velocities even when the plasma
is cold. This can be understood intuitively. Since the

longitudinal wave quanta spend part of their time being
carried by some excited charged bosons, they propagate
together with these charged bosons, which have nonzero
velocities.

c (1 + χv(ωc, k = 0)) = ω2

The photon modes and the plasmon mode have the
same cutoﬀ frequency ωc, which is given by the solution
to the equation ω2
p. The cutoﬀ
frequency ωc, or the mass gap, is less than the plasma
frequency ωp due to the vacuum polarization.
It can
be shown that the ratio ωc/ωp decreases with increasing
ωp/2m. This can be understood intuitively. Vacuum po-
larization produces virtual pairs near charged particles.
These virtual pairs screen the electric ﬁeld of charged
particles, so the eﬀective electric charge of particles are
reduced. For higher plasma densities, the virtual pair
density is also higher, resulting in stronger shielding of
the electric charge and consequently smaller cutoﬀ fre-
quencies. To get a sense of how small the vacuum polar-
ization eﬀect is, let us approximate ωc when ωp/2m = 1.
Write g = 2e2/3(4π)2. Since the physical value for elec-
tron charge is g = α/6π (cid:28) 1, where α ≈ 1/137 is the
ﬁne structure constant, the equation for ωc can be solved
asymptotically. To lowest order, ωc/ωp ∼ 1 − g/6. We
see the eﬀect of the vacuum polarization is minuscule.

Now let us check that classical dispersion relations are
recovered when taking the classical limit in relativistic
quantum results. Since energy of particles are not quant-
ized in unmagnetized plasmas, the non-relativistic low
energy limit is the classical limit. In the low energy limit

This can be understood from the perspective of spatial
scales by ﬁxing ω and letting k go to inﬁnity.
In this
perspective, since the wave length of a high energy gauge
boson is much smaller than the typical inter-particle spa-
cing in the plasma, the gauge boson rarely encounters
a plasma particle and propagates as if it is in the va-
cuum. The asymptotic behavior (65) can also be un-
derstood from the perspective of time scales by ﬁxing k
and letting ω go to inﬁnity.
In this perspective, since
the wave frequency is much larger than the plasma fre-
quency, the plasma does not have time to respond. Un-
like the plasma response, which diminishes in the high
energy limit k2/m2 → ∞, the real part of the vacuum
susceptibility blows up

This positive imaginary part is proportional to the total

in which case there are more types of particles that the
massive gauge boson can decay into. After its typical life

A. Background functions

Let us choose a coordinate system such that the uni-
form magnetic ﬁeld with strength B0 points in the +z
direction. Since the choice of gauge does not aﬀect ﬁnal
results, we are free to use the symmetric gauge

¯Aµ = (0,− 1

B0y,

B0x, 0).

(68)

This gauge is convenient since it respects the rotation
symmetry of the system.

Having chosen the background gauge ¯A, the ﬁeld φ0
can be solved from its equation of motion (5). The
solutions are relativistic Landau levels, which have been
obtained by a number of authors [21]. Since particles
are conﬁned by the magnetic ﬁeld in the xy-plane, for a
single-boson wave function to be normalizable, it is only
necessary to impose a periodic box in the z-direction.
Let L be the length of this periodic box. Then in polar

(72)

In the azimuthal wave functions, the upper and lower sign
of ∓ in front of θ correspond to the case eB0 > 0 and
eB0 < 0, respectively. These signs account for the fact
that positively and negatively charged particles gyrate
in opposite directions. To see the wave functions are
properly normalized, one can calculate, for example, the
total current in the z-direction.

To deal with plasmas that are inﬁnitely large, we fol-
low procedures in Sec.
III. Namely, we ﬁrst consider
ﬁnite number of particles in a spatial box of size L and
temporal box of length T . Using the many-body wave
function and taking the limit L, T → ∞ while keeping
the plasma density ﬁxed is equivalent to using the eﬀect-
ive single-boson wave function

and summations over the discrete labels n, l,and  over

Besides the wave functions, we will also need the
Green’s function of charged bosons in a uniform mag-
netic ﬁeld. The Green’s function can either be found by
calculating the propagator of the quantized ϕ ﬁeld, or
more directly by solving the Schwinger−Dyson equation
(27). There are many representations of the Green’s func-
tion, for example, the spectral representation [25] and the

proper time representation [38]. A useful expression of
the Green’s function for our purpose is obtained in Ap-
pendix A. The Green’s function can be put into the form

This form of the Green’s function respects a number of
symmetries of the system. It is manifestly invariant un-
der the rotation around the z-axis. It is also invariant
under parity x → −x. Finally, it is invariant under the
joint symmetry action of charge conjugation e → −e
and time reversal t → −t, B0 → −B0. These deman-
ded symmetry properties will enable easy extraction of
physics later on. Notice that the Green’s function has
poles when q0 = ±En,q(cid:107) . These are nothing other than
the dispersion relations of charged particles occupying re-
lativistic Landau levels. When the ϕ ﬁeld propagates, it
can propagate through any of these channels.

B. Vacuum response

We will not consider the vacuum response in this sec-
tion for three reasons. First, as can be seen from Sec. III,
eﬀects of the vacuum response are minuscule compared
to eﬀects of the plasma response for low energy waves7.
Second, due to (29) and (30), contributions by plasmas
and the vacuum are separable. Ignoring the vacuum re-
sponse does not break any symmetry of the system. Fi-
nally, for a practical reason, obtaining a useful expression
of the vacuum response is highly nontrivial. Although
many representations of the response tensor have been
obtained [23], they can be evaluated analytically only in
some special limits [39, 40].

C. Plasma response

After choosing the density of state appropriately, such
that the equation for the background EM ﬁeld ∂µ ¯F µν = 0
is satisﬁed, we can evaluate the plasma response tensor
(24) by plugging in the eﬀective single-boson wave func-
tions (73) and the Green’s function (74), followed by in-
tegration over the continuous label p(cid:107)/2π and summa-
tions over the discrete labels n, l, and .

Let us consider the example of a cold particle plasma,
in which all charged bosons are condensed in the lowest
Landau levels. In the rest frame of the cold plasma, the
density of state

7 It is safe to ignore the vacuum response when the wave rest en-

than the electron rest energy mec2.

where n0 is the number density of the plasma. The three
δ-functions make it very easy to carry out the integra-
tions over p(cid:107)/2π and summations over n, l, and . Using
covariant derivatives listed in Appendix B, it is easy to
calculate the many-body current. The current density
due to each charged species is

¯J µ
0 = en0(1, 0, 0, 0).

The self-consistency condition (cid:80)

This is what one would expect of a uniform cold ﬂuid.

bining the polarization term with the mass term, the

of the s-channel and the t-channel Feynman diagrams of
the forward scattering of a gauge boson.

The plasma response tensor (78) satisﬁes a number of
required symmetries. It satisﬁes the exchange symmetry
2,bk(−k), as required by (34). It is invariant
ˆΣµν
2,bk(k) = ˆΣνµ
under the rotation around the z-axis, which is a basic
symmetry of the system. Moreover, it transforms prop-
ν = diag(−1, 1, 1, 1)
erly under time reversal symmetry T µ
ˆΣαβ(−ω, k)|−B0. Finally, using
by ˆΣµν(ω, k)|B0 = T µ
property (C16) of the conﬂuent hypergeometric function,
it is straightforward to check that the Ward−Takahashi
identity (36), which is required by charge conservation
and gauge invariance, is satisﬁed. In addition to these
symmetry properties, the plasma response tensor (78)
has a number of asymptotic properties. First, since the
conﬂuent hypergeometric function 1F1(a; b; z) has poles
whenever b equals to nonpositive integers, the response
tensor has poles whenever ω = ±ω±
n,k(cid:107) , where the fre-
quency of relativistic quantum cyclotron resonances

∼

n,k(cid:107) + 2(m + |Ω|/2), “ + ”,
ω−
k2(cid:107)/2m + n|Ω|,
“ − ”.

(80)

The above asymptotic behavior is in the limit k(cid:107),|Ω| (cid:28)
m. These resonances have clear physical meanings. The
ω−
n,k(cid:107) resonance corresponds to the energy it takes to ex-
cite a plasma particle from the ground state to the n-
th Landau level with parallel momentum k(cid:107). The ω+
n,k(cid:107)
resonance corresponds to the aforementioned excitation
energy plus the energy it takes to create a pair of new
particles in ground states. The second important asymp-
totic property of the response tensor (78) is when the
magnetic ﬁeld B0 → 0. In this limit, the ground state
mass m0 asymptotes to the bare mass m. Moreover, use
the asymptotic property that 1F1(1; b; z) → b/(b − z)
when z, b → ∞ while keeping b/z ﬁxed [41], we can ﬁnd
the asymptotic behavior of the K-function

Here k2 = kµkµ is the Minkowski inner product. Using
the above expression, it is straightforward to check that
in the limit B0 → 0, the response tensor (78) of cold
magnetized plasmas asymptotes to the response tensor
(57) of cold unmagnetized plasmas.

D. Wave dispersion relations

Let us choose a coordinate system such that the wave
4-momentum kµ = (ω, k⊥, 0, k(cid:107)). Since k2 = 0 in this
coordinate system, the plasma response tensor (78) can
be simpliﬁed. To facilitate discussions next, let us write
the wave dispersion relation (39) explicitly

ˆΣ32

k⊥k(cid:107) + ˆΣ13
ω2−k2⊥ + ˆΣ33

ˆΣ23

 = 0.

(82)

The situation becomes particularly simple when the wave
vector is exactly parallel (k⊥ = 0) or perpendicular (k(cid:107) =
0) to the magnetic ﬁeld. In these cases, Λi3 = Λ3i = 0
for both i = 1 and 2, so simple analytical expressions of
the dispersion relations can be obtained.

1. Perpendicular propagation

13

When waves propagate perpendicular to the magnetic
ﬁeld, namely, when k(cid:107) = 0, the contributions by each
charged species to the nonvanishing spatial components
of the plasma response tensor are

(83)

The dispersion relations can be easily read out by sub-
stituting these into Eq. (82). When the wave E-ﬁeld is
parallel to the background B-ﬁeld, the wave is transverse.
The dispersion relation of this ordinary electromagnetic
wave (O-wave) is

ω2 =

mω2
p
m0

+ k2⊥.

(84)

This is very similar to the dispersion relation of the O-
wave in classical plasmas, except that the bare mass m
is now replaced by the ground state mass m0. When the
wave E-ﬁeld is perpendicular to the background B-ﬁeld,
the longitudinal and transverse components of the wave
are mixed by the oﬀ-diagonal components of the response
tensor. Relativistic quantum cyclotron resonances (80)
hybridize with the extraordinary electromagnetic wave
(X-wave) by the dispersion relation

(ω2 + ˆΣ11)(ω2 − k2⊥ + ˆΣ22) − ˆΣ12 ˆΣ21 = 0.

(85)

While the X-wave is more or less captured by classical
plasma theories, cyclotron resonances, also known as the
Bernstein waves, are absent in classical plasma theor-
ies when plasmas are cold [42]. In classical plasma the-
ories, charged particles sample wave ﬁelds along their
gyro-orbits. Bernstein resonances arise when their gyro-
frequencies match the wave frequency. If plasma temper-
ature is zero, cyclotron motion of classical particles stops
and Bernstein resonances vanish consequently. However,
this is not the case when quantum eﬀects are taken into
account. Using the uncertainty principle and the fact
that the kinetic momentums Pµ = −i ¯Dµ do not commute
[ ¯Dµ, ¯Dν] = −ie ¯Fµν, it is easy to see that the gyromotion
of quantum charged particles never stops. So Bernstein
waves persist in a quantum plasma even when it is cold.

FIG. 3. Perpendicular wave dispersion relations in a magnet-
ized, cold, spinless electron gas with immobile ions as neutral-
izing background. Parameters used for making this plot are
ωpe/|Ωe| = 0.7 and |Ωe|/me = 0.1. The solid curves are waves
in a relativistic quantum plasma and the dashed curves are
corresponding waves in a classical plasma. The red curves
are the ordinary electromagnetic waves. The blue curves
are the extraordinary electromagnetic waves hybridized with
cyclotron resonances. The dashed gray line across the di-
agonal represents the light cone. Notice that near the light
cone, wave dispersion relations in the relativistic quantum
plasma asymptote to wave dispersion relations in the classical
plasma. While the classical dispersion relations only capture
the upper-hybrid resonance ωUH, the relativistic quantum dis-
persion relations capture all cyclotron resonances. Notice that
gaps between Bernstein waves remain open even when the re-
lativistic quantum plasma is cold. Also notice that cyclotron
resonances are not harmonically spaced. The 5-th resonance
occurs near 4Ω instead of 5Ω in this example.

An example of wave dispersion relations for perpen-
dicular propagation is plotted in Fig. 3. For the sake
of clarity, we set the mass of ions to inﬁnity, such that
the immobile ions merely serve as a neutralizing back-
ground. By doing so, ion resonances and the gapless
compressional Alfv´en wave are removed, and what re-
main are the O-wave, the X-wave, and the relativistic
quantum electron Bernstein waves. We only plot the low
energy branches with ω, k(cid:107) (cid:28) me, for which eﬀects of
the vacuum polarization can be safely ignored. Para-
meters used for making this plot are ωpe/|Ωe| = 0.7 and
|Ωe|/me = 0.1. In Fig. 3, the solid curves are dispersion
relations in a relativistic quantum plasma and the dashed
curves are dispersion relations in a classical plasma. The
solid and the dashed red curves almost overlap, since the
dispersion relations of the relativistic quantum and the
classical O-wave diﬀer only in their mass gaps by the ratio
m/m0 (cid:46) 1. The blue curves are the X-waves hybridized
with cyclotron resonances. While the classical disper-
sion relation only captures the upper-hybrid resonance

at ωUH =

occurs near 4Ω instead of 5Ω in this example.

powers ω2l+1 → ω2lωn, such that the asymptotic beha-
vior ω ∼ k⊥ near the light cone is respected. To lowest

Cyclotron resonances in strongly magnetized plasmas
are anharmonically spaced. In uniform magnetic ﬁelds,
the anharmonicity is due to relativistic eﬀect, which red-
shifts the cyclotron resonance ωn from its classical value
n|Ω|. The redshift is signiﬁcant when either the B-ﬁeld is

n in Eq.
(80), it is easy to see when in the weak ﬁeld limit |Ω| (cid:28)
m, cyclotron resonances are harmonically spaced ωn ∼
nω1. While in the strong ﬁeld limit |Ω| (cid:29) m, cyclotron
resonances are anharmonically spaced with ωn ∼ √
nω1.

FIG. 4. Ratios of the frequencies of cyclotron harmonics to
the frequency of the fundamental. The solid curves are ra-
tios when relativistic quantum eﬀects are taken into account,
and the dashed curves are the classical ratios. Quantum ef-
fects sustain cyclotron resonances even when the plasma is
cold. Relativistic eﬀects space resonances anharmonically
even when the magnetic ﬁeld is uniform. Notice that the
anharmonicity is larger for stronger magnetic ﬁeld and higher
harmonic order.

When magnetized plasmas are illuminated by external
light sources, cyclotron resonances appear as absorption
features. These anharmonic cyclotron absorption fea-
tures have been observed in the spectra of a number of
X-ray pulsars [2–7], whose polar caps serve as external
light sources that illuminate their magnetospheres, which
are made of magnetized plasmas. The frequencies of line
centers are determined by ω−
n,k(cid:107) , which is given by Eq.
(80). By ﬁtting locations of absorption lines to Eq. (80),
the line-averaged magnetic ﬁeld can be determined. As
has been noted in the previous paragraph, the spacing
between absorption lines becomes anharmonic when Eq.
(88) is satisﬁed. For X-ray pulsars, B0 ∼ 1012 G, and
the redshift starts to be signiﬁcant from the 9-th res-
onance. The width and optical depth of the absorption
lines are determined by gaps between branches of Bern-
stein waves, as well as the inhomogeneities of the plasma.
Qualitatively, as can be seen from Fig. 3, lower Bernstein
branches have larger gaps, resulting in wider absorption
lines with larger optical depth. Quantitatively, when
plasma density and magnetic ﬁeld proﬁle are known, the
absorption line shapes can be found by solving the ra-
diative transfer equations [1], in which photons advec-
tion is governed by the dispersion relation (82). Con-
versely, when the absorption line shapes are measured,
the plasma and magnetic ﬁeld proﬁle can be retrieved by
solving the inverse problem. Thus a new era in astrophys-
ics has been opened, in which the proﬁle and evolution of
the magnetosphere of an X-ray pulsar can be measured
as it accretes materials from its companion star.

2. Parallel propagation

When waves propagate parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld,
namely, when k⊥ = 0, the nonvanishing spatial compon-
ents of the plasma response tensor can be written as

ˆΣ11 = ˆΣ22 = ω2(S − 1),
ˆΣ12 = − ˆΣ21 = −iω2D,
ˆΣ33 = ω2(P − 1).

(89)

In the above expressions, S = (R + L)/2, D = (R− L)/2,
and P are notations of permittivities typically used in
classical plasma physics. Using these notations, the dis-
persion relations of the right-handed circularly polarized
electromagnetic R-wave, the left-handed circularly polar-
ized electromagnetic L-wave, and the longitudinal elec-
trostatic P-wave are

R = n2(cid:107),

L = n2(cid:107),

P = 0.

(90)

where n(cid:107) = k(cid:107)/ω is the refractive index. Writing summa-
tions over charged species explicitly, the permittivities

In the expressions of R and L, the upper and lower sign of
∓ and ± correspond to esB0 > 0 and esB0 < 0, respect-
ively. Since particle energy is not quantized in the direc-
tion parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld, the low energy limit is
the classical limit. In the classical limit ω, k(cid:107),|Ωe| (cid:28) me,
it is clear that the above expressions asymptote to their
classical values. Consequently, wave dispersion relations
in relativistic quantum plasmas asymptote to those in
classical plasmas.

An example of wave dispersion relations for parallel
propagation in a quasineutral electron-ion plasma is plot-
ted in Fig. 5. Only low energy branches with ω, k(cid:107) (cid:28) me
are plotted, for which eﬀects of the vacuum polarization
can be safely ignored.
In the ﬁgure, the solid curves
are wave dispersion relations in a relativistic quantum
plasma and the dashed curves are corresponding wave
dispersion relations in a classical plasma. The black and
blue curves are the right- and left-handed circularly po-
larized EM waves, respectively. The red curves are the
longitudinal electrostatic waves, which include a gapped
Langmuir wave and a gapless acoustic wave. For relativ-
istic eﬀects to be visible, the magnetic ﬁeld is made strong
such that |Ωe|/me = 0.1. For ion eﬀects to be visible, the
mass of ions is chosen to be close to the electron mass
with mi/me = 3. The ratio of the plasma frequency to
the gyrofrequency is chosen to be ωpe/|Ωe| = 0.7. It is
easy to see that the relativistic quantum dispersion rela-
tions asymptote to the classical dispersion relations near
the light cone.

FIG. 5. Parallel wave dispersion relations in a cold, magnet-
ized, quasineutral, spinless electron-ion plasma. For various
eﬀects to be visible on the scale of this ﬁgure, parameters
used for making this plot are ωpe/|Ωe| = 0.7, |Ωe|/me = 0.1
and mi/me = 3. The solid curves are waves in a relativistic
quantum plasma and the dashed curves are corresponding
waves in a classical plasma. The black and blue curves are
the right- and left-handed circularly polarized electromagnetic
waves, respectively. The red curves are the longitudinal elec-
trostatic waves, which include a gapped Langmuir wave and a
gapless acoustic wave. The dashed gray line across the diag-
onal represents the light cone. Notice that near the light cone,
wave dispersion relations in the relativistic quantum plasma
asymptote to wave dispersion relations in the classical plasma.

ωR0 − ωR

To get a sense of how large relativistic quantum cor-
rections are, we can calculate the cutoﬀ frequencies, the
wave frequencies when the wave vector k = 0. In a single-
species plasma, the approximated cutoﬀ frequencies in
the limit ωp ∼ |Ω| (cid:28) m are

Here ωR0 is the cutoﬀ frequency of the R-wave in a clas-
sical plasma and ωR is the cutoﬀ frequency of the R-
wave in a relativistic quantum plasma. Similar nota-
tions are used for the L-wave and the P-wave. As expec-
ted, relativistic quantum eﬀects are large when |Ω| ∼ m,
namely, when the energy scale of the background mag-
netic ﬁeld is comparable to the rest energy of charged
particles.
Although relativistic quantum corrections of cutoﬀs
are small when |Ω| (cid:28) m, they can be important
when magniﬁed by singularities of refractive indices near

cutoﬀs. For example, Faraday rotation, the rotation of
the wave polarization axis caused by the phase velo-
city diﬀerence between the R-wave and the L-waves of
the same frequency, can be substantially modiﬁed near
cutoﬀs. Denote θ(z) the polarization angle of a linearly
polarized wave as it propagates along the z-axis. Then
Faraday rotation per vacuum wave length λ = 2πc/ω
is given by the well-known formula λ ˙θ = π(nR − nL),
where nR and nL are refractive indices of the R-wave
and the L-wave, respectively. A comparison between
Faraday rotations in a relativistic quantum plasma and
a classical plasma is plotted in Fig. 6(a), for parameters
ωpe/|Ωe| = 0.7 and |Ωe|/me = 0.1. In the ﬁgure, the left
axis is Faraday rotation per vacuum wavelength. The
solid black curve is the Faraday rotation λ ˙θ in a relativ-
istic quantum plasma and the dashed black curve is the
Faraday rotation λ ˙θ0 in a classical plasma. The right
axis of the ﬁgure is the relative diﬀerence ˙θ0/ ˙θ − 1. As
can be seen from the ﬁgure, while the relative diﬀerence
asymptotes to a small number |Ωe|/me when ω (cid:29) |Ωe|,
it can be of order 1 near the classical cutoﬀ of the R-
wave. Denote δ the relative diﬀerence at ω = ωR0. The
region in the ne − B space where δ is of order 1 is plot-
ted in Fig. 6(b).
In the ﬁgure, the horizontal axis is
the density of the electron gas and the vertical axis is
the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld. The region above
the solid black contour is where δ > 100%, the region
above the large-dashed black contour is where δ > 10%,
and the region above the small-dashed black contour is
where δ > 1%. To facilitate reading of the ﬁgure, con-
tours of ωR0 are also plotted. The blue contour is where
ωR0 = 10 eV, the red contour is where ωR0 = 1 eV, and
the gray contour is where ωR0 = 0.1 eV. The contours
of δ and ωR0 combined can be used to determined how
important relativistic quantum corrections are in a given
situation. For example, the small-dashed black contour
and the red contour intersect around ne ∼ 1019 cm−3
and B ∼ 108 G. This means if laser with photon en-
ergy ω ∼ 1 eV is used to diagnose such plasma, then
ignoring relativistic quantum eﬀects will introduce ∼ 1%
systematic error.

In laser plasma experiments, when lasers with frequen-
cies close to classical cutoﬀs are used for diagnostics, re-
lativistic quantum corrections of wave dispersion rela-
tions need to be taken into account in order to avoid
systematic errors. As can be seen from Fig. 6(a), if one
tries to match data points on the relativistic quantum
curve by shifting the classical curve, then |Ωe| will have
to be smaller than its true value, resulting in systematic
errors. As the frequency of the diagnostic laser increases,
the inferred magnetic ﬁeld strength approaches its true
value from the below. This is why the inferred magnetic
ﬁeld appears to increase with the frequency of the dia-
gnostic laser when classical formulas are used. In exper-
iments conducted by Tatarakis, Wagner and their coau-
thors [17, 18], the magnetic ﬁeld strength is determined
from Cotton-Mouton eﬀect, which depends on frequen-
cies of cutoﬀs just as the Faraday rotation does. It is bey-
ond the scope of this paper to go into details, but the pe-

cold, magnetized, spinless electron gas. The solid and dashed
black curves are Faraday rotations in a relativistic quantum
plasma and a classical plasma, respectively. The red curve
is their relative diﬀerence. Parameters used for making this
plot are ωpe/|Ωe| = 0.7 and |Ωe|/me = 0.1. Notice that near
the classical cutoﬀ ωR0, Faraday rotations in the relativistic
quantum plasma and the classical plasma diﬀer signiﬁcantly.
(b) Region in the ne − B space where relativistic quantum
corrections are important. The regions above the solid, large-
dashed and small-dashed black contours are regions where
δ > 100%, 10% and 1%, respectively. The blue, red and
gray contours are where ωR0 = 10 eV, 1 eV and 0.1 eV, re-
spectively. These two sets of contours combined can be used
to determine how important relativistic quantum corrections
are in given conditions. See the main text for more details.

culiar dependence of the inferred magnetic ﬁeld strength
on the frequencies of diagnostic lasers can already be
understood qualitatively as a consequence of relativistic
quantum corrections of cutoﬀ frequencies.

V. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION

In this paper, we show that quantum ﬁeld theory
is an eﬀective language for plasma physics. This lan-
guage naturally incorporates relativistic and quantum ef-
fects without the necessity of manually adding patches
to plasma models. To demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of
this language, we study wave propagation in scalar QED
plasmas by calculating the 1-loop eﬀective action of wave
propagation. The 1-loop eﬀective action contains all in-
formation of linear waves, and particularly, the disper-
sion relations. To order e2, the eﬀectively action (Eqs.
20-25) captures eﬀects of the polarization of the back-
ground plasma as well as the polarization of the vacuum.
Using the 1-loop eﬀective action and explicit expres-
sions of cold plasma response tensors (Eqs.
57 and
78), we show that all linear waves well-known in clas-

sical plasma theories can be recovered from relativistic
quantum results when taking the classical limit. In un-
magnetized plasmas (Fig. 2), the eigenmodes are the
degenerate EM waves, the Langmuir wave, and the ion
acoustic wave. When propagating perpendicular to the
external B-ﬁeld (Fig. 3), the eigenmodes are the electro-
magnetic O-wave and X-wave, and the electrostatic com-
pressional Alfv´en wave and the Bernstein waves. When
propagating parallel to the external B-ﬁeld (Fig. 5), the
eigenmodes are the electromagnetic R-wave and L-wave,
and the electrostatic Langmuir wave and acoustic wave.
Since the Lagrangian of classical charged particles can
be deduced from the relativistic quantum Lagrangian by
making semiclassical approximations [43], the agreement
between relativistic quantum results and classical results
in the classical regime is not coincidental.

When relativistic quantum eﬀects are important, we
show that corrections to classical wave dispersion rela-
tions have profound observable consequences.
In cold
unmagnetized plasmas, relativistic quantum eﬀects are
important when either the plasma frequency ωp or the
wave vector ck is comparable to electron rest energy
mec2.
In these regimes, longitudinal waves propagate
with nonzero group velocities even when the plasma is
cold (Fig. 2). When propagating perpendicular the ex-
ternal B-ﬁeld, quantum eﬀects sustain cyclotron reson-
ances even when the plasma is cold, and relativistic ef-
fects space these resonances anharmonically even when
the magnetic ﬁeld is uniform (Fig. 4). By providing ex-
plicit expressions of wave dispersion relations in strongly
magnetized plasmas, we open up a new era in astrophys-
ics where proﬁles of magnetospheres of X-ray pulsars can
be retrieved from anharmonic cyclotron absorption fea-
tures observed in their spectra. When propagating par-
allel to external B-ﬁelds, cutoﬀ frequencies are modiﬁed
diﬀerently by relativistic quantum eﬀects. These modiﬁc-
ations can be important even when relativistic quantum
corrections are small, if lasers whose frequencies are close
to the cutoﬀs are used for diagnostics. In this paper, we
describe how Faraday rotation is modiﬁed (Fig. 6a) and
map out the parameter space where such modiﬁcations
are important (Fig. 6b). We show that for a large range
of parameters relevant to laser plasma experiments, re-
lativistic quantum corrections need to be taken into ac-
count in order to avoid systematic errors.

Our descriptions of relativistic quantum plasmas are
enabled by developing a quantum ﬁeld theory with non-
trivial background ﬁelds. The idea of separating clas-
sical backgrounds from quantum ﬂuctuations is an ex-
tension to Furry’s picture of strong ﬁeld QED [44]. In
addition to external EM ﬁelds, which are treated non-
perturbatively in strong ﬁeld QED, we also take into ac-
count of the existence of non-perturbative background
charged particle ﬁelds. The formidable task of ﬁnding S-
matrix elements by calculating quantum correlation func-
tions whose end states contain inﬁnitely many particles is
reduced by incorporating eﬀects of background charged
particle ﬁelds directly into the Lagrangian. Such an in-
corporation, which has been attempted phenomenologic-

17

ally by Shvets [45], is made rigorous and systematic in
this paper. We partition the ﬁelds into classical back-
grounds and quantum ﬂuctuations similar to what has
been done by Raicher et al.
[46]. We make further
progress by simplifying the Lagrangian using the self-
consistency of backgrounds, and developing the classical
ﬁeld theory to quantum level by including 1-loop eﬀects.
In this way, we thoroughly clarify the role of background
ﬁelds and use boson plasmas as examples to demon-
strate how nontrivial background ﬁelds can be treated
in quantum ﬁeld theory from ﬁrst principle.

Using our formalism, further progress can be made
by calculating higher order terms in the perturbation
series.
In the next order, eﬀects such as particle colli-
sion and wave scattering will contribute. Without these
eﬀects, the linear response theory we have developed in
this paper is a random phase approximation of relativistic
quantum plasmas, in which particles respond collectively
to the mean ﬁeld instead of interacting directly with each
other. To go beyond the random phase approximation,
two steps are necessary. The ﬁrst step is to solve the
interacting many-body wave functions Φ0 and ¯A. The
second step is to calculate the eﬀective action to higher
order in the perturbation series. For example, to describe
wave propagation in thermal plasmas, one should ﬁrst
solve the thermal background states, which contain not
only a thermal distribution of charged particles, but also
a thermal distribution of wave quanta [47], and then cal-
culate the propagator of the gauge boson to higher loops
such that eﬀects of collision between charged particles
and scattering of waves are taken into account.

In the end, we want to point out the implication of
this work for quantum ﬁeld theory. An important con-
sequence of including nontrivial background ﬁelds is a
new mechanism for mass generation in gauge theories.
In the Higgs mechanism [48, 49], gauge bosons acquire
masses through a gauge-symmetry-breaking mass term.
For such a term to arise, the bare mass of the scalar
ﬁeld is required to be imaginary in order for the gauge
symmetry to be spontaneously broken. In contrast, when
nontrivial background ﬁelds are present, gauge bosons ac-
quire masses through a gauge invariant response tensor
(Eqs. 22 and 29). The response tensor endows gauge
bosons with their masses, requiring that neither the bare
mass of the scalar ﬁeld be imaginary, nor the local gauge
symmetry be broken.

it is straightforward to check the Green’s function (A2)
solves the Schwinger−Dyson equation (27) in the Landau
gauge. This form of the Green’s function is expanded by
wave functions that are eigenfunctions of the E× B drift.
These eigenfunctions are featured by free propagation in
the z-direction, the direction of the B ﬁeld; free propaga-
tion in the x-direction, the direction of E × B drift; and
harmonic oscillation in the y-direction, the direction of
the E-ﬁeld. These features make the Green’s function
(A2) a convenient form for studying DC quantum Hall
conductivity. But the loss of rotation symmetry in the
perpendicular plane makes it inconvenient for studying
AC wave phenomena.

To restore the rotation symmetry, we need to make
a gauge transformation into the symmetric gauge (68).
The symmetric gauge is related to the Landau gauge (A1)
by gauge transformation (13) with

χ = − 1
2

B0xy.

(A4)

Under this gauge transformation, the Green’s function is
transformed by (26) as

GS(x, x(cid:48)) = e−ieB0(xy−x(cid:48)y(cid:48))/2GL(x, x(cid:48)),

(A5)

where GS denotes the Green’s function in the symmetric
gauge. In the symmetric gauge, the eigenfunctions (69)
are circular in the perpendicular plane, so the Green’s
function GS, which can be expanded by these eigenfunc-
tions, is also invariant under rotation around the z-axis.
To put GS in a manifestly rotational invariant form, we
need the following relation between the Hermite functions
and the Laguerre functions

dqe−2iquψn(q + v)ψn(q − v) = Λ(0)

n (2(u2 + v2)). (A6)

(cid:90)

We have thus proved the identity (A6), which relates the
integral of the Hermite functions to the Laguerre func-
tions.

Using identity (A6), we can carry out the k⊥ integ-
ral in the Green’s function (A2) and put the result in a
rotational invariant form. With the following change of

Finally, using the completeness of the Laguerre func-

tions [41]

n (x2 + y2) = πδ(x)δ(y),

it is straightforward to check that the Green’s function

of the Green’s function for later calculations.

APPENDIX C: CALCULATION OF Π00

2,bk

In this appendix, we calculate Π00

2,bk of a cold and
uniformly magnetized plasma. For conciseness, we use
abbreviations in Appendix B. We further abbreviate
0,l,0, τ = t − t(cid:48), ζ = z − z(cid:48), k = (k1, k2), and
Ψl = Ψ+
η = (η1, η2). Substituting the density of states (75) into
the eﬀective single-boson wave function (73) and use it
in place of the background ﬁeld φ0 in the expression of
the background polarization (24), we have

Note Π00
2,bk only depends on the diﬀerence between co-
ordinates rµ = (x − x(cid:48))µ. This is expected since the
system is translational invariant.
In the Fourier space, since the system is translational
invariant, we know ˆΠ(k, k(cid:48)) = (2π)4δ(4)(k − k(cid:48)) ˆΠ(k). De-
noting kη = k1η1 + k2η2, we have

Other components of the plasma response tensor

calculating other components, one will encounter Fourier

Take the limit B0 → 0, it is easy to see that the above ex-
pression recovers the polarization tensor ˆΠ00
2,bk in the un-
magnetized case. Notice that the pole of π00
n is weighted
by wn(κ) = e−κ2
(κ2)n/n!, which is proportional to the
strength of interaction between the plane wave with 4-
momentum k and particles in the n-th Landau level. The
weighting factor maximizes at κ2 = n. For large n, the
maximum value scale as wn ∼ 1/
2πn. We see waves
couple more strongly to electrons in lower Landau levels.
The summation in (C7) can be carried out using the
conﬂuent hypergeometric functions 1F1(a; b; z). Using
the deﬁnition and properties of the conﬂuent hypergeo-
metric functions [41], we have

To carry out summations similar to (C8), the follow-
ing recurrence relation of the conﬂuent hypergeometric
function is useful [41]
b 1F1(a; b; z) = b 1F1(a − 1; b; z) + z 1F1(a; b + 1; z).
(C14)
Using this recurrence relation, summations that appear
in the calculation of other components of ˆΠµν
2,bk can be
simpliﬁed. For example,

∞(cid:88)

n=0

x + 1 1F1(1; x + 2;−z)

(C15)

In terms of the K-function, the recurrence relation

(C14) becomes

(C8)

xK(x, y) − yK(x − 1, y) = 1.

(C16)

Using this identity, it is straightforward to show that
the response tensor (78) satisﬁes the Ward−Takahashi
identity.
