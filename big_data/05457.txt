Abstract. This paper is concerned with relationships of Lyapunov exponents with sensi-

tivity and stability for non-autonomous discrete systems. Some new concepts are introduced
for non-autonomous discrete systems, including Lyapunov exponents, strong sensitivity at a

point and in a set, Lyapunov stability, and exponential asymptotical stability. It is shown
that the positive Lyapunov exponent at a point implies strong sensitivity for a class of non-

autonomous discrete systems. Furthermore, the uniformly positive Lyapunov exponents in
a totally invariant set imply strong sensitivity in this set under certain conditions. It is also
shown that the negative Lyapunov exponent at a point implies exponential asymptotical

stability for a class of non-autonomous discrete systems. The related existing results for
autonomous discrete systems are generalized to non-autonomous discrete systems and their

conditions are weaken. One example is provided for illustration.

Keywords: non-autonomous discrete system; Lyapunov exponent; strong sensitivity;

exponential asymptotical stability.

1. Introduction

Chaos is a universal dynamical behavior of nonlinear systems, and becoming more and
more popular in the research of nonlinear science. Sensitivity, which is popularized by

the meteorologist Lorenz through the so-called “butterﬂy eﬀect”, is widely understood as
the central element of chaos. Therefore, the study on sensitivity has attracted a lot of

attention from many scholars [1, 4, 10–12, 14, 30]. However, many results give some suﬃcient
conditions for sensitivity, which are qualitative and thus not easy to be veriﬁed, whereas

Lyapunov exponents can characterize sensitivity in a quantitative perspective at some extent.

The concept of Lyapunov exponent was dated back to Lyapunov, when he studied the
stability of solutions of ordinary diﬀerential equations, and he proved that the solution of a

regular system is stable if all the Lyapunov exponents are negative [22]. In 1946, Chetaev
showed that the solution of a regular system is unstable if at least one Lyapunov exponent

is positive [7]. Their works were followed by some other scholars [3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 13, 15, 16,
18–21, 23, 24]. Recently, several results about Lyapunov instability or stability of solutions
of discrete dynamical systems were also obtained. For instance, in 2004, Abraham et al.

showed that the positive Lyapunov exponents almost everywhere imply a kind of sensitivity
for measure-preserving maps [2].

It was always taken for granted that positive Lyapunov exponents imply sensitivity and
negative Lyapunov exponents imply stability. However, in 2001, Demir et al. proved that

this conclusion may not hold for general interval maps by two examples [9], one of which
shows that a system is not sensitive at a point with positive Lyapunov exponent, and the

other shows that a system is sensitive at a point with negative Lyapunov exponent. So it
is very interesting to investigate relationships of Lyapunov exponents with sensitivity and
stability. In 2010, Ko¸cak and Palmer showed that the positive strong Lyapunov exponent at

a point implies sensitivity, and the negative Lyapunov exponent at a point implies Lyapunov
stability under contain conditions for diﬀerentiable interval maps [16]. Since many complex

systems occurring in the real-world problems such as physical, biological, and economical
problems are necessarily described by non-autonomous discrete systems, many scientists and

mathematicians focused on complexity of non-autonomous discrete systems recently [5, 14,
17, 25–30]. Motivated by all the above works, we shall try to investigate relationships of
Lyapunov exponents with sensitivity and stability for non-autonomous discrete systems in

the present paper.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents some basic concepts

and useful lemmas. In Sections 3 and 4, some relationship between the positive Lyapunov
exponent and strong sensitivity, and some relationship between negative Lyapunov exponent

and exponential asymptotical stability for non-autonomous discrete systems are investigated,
respectively. Finally, the non-autonomous logistic system is discussed in Section 5 as an

illustrative example.

2. Preliminaries

In this section, some basic concepts are presented, including Lyapunov exponents, strong
sensitivity, Lyapunov stability, and exponential asymptotical stability for non-autonomous

discrete systems. In addition, some useful lemmas are also presented.

We shall consider the following non-autonomous discrete system in the present paper:

xn+1 = fn(xn), n ≥ 0,

(2.1)

where fn : X → X is a map for each n ≥ 0, and X is metric space with metric d.

For any x0 ∈ X, {xn}∞

and xn = f n
ball of radius ǫ, centered at x0.

0 (x0), n ≥ 0, where f n

n=0 is called the (positive) orbit of system (2.1) starting from x0
0 := fn−1 ◦ · · · ◦ f0. Further, by Bǫ(x0) denote the open

Deﬁnition 2.1. System (2.1) is said to be sensitive at a point x0 ∈ X if there exists a

constant δ > 0 such that for any neighborhood U of x0, there exist y0 ∈ U and a positive
integer N such that d(f N
0 (x0)) > δ, while δ is called a sensitivity constant of system
(2.1) at x0. Furthermore, system (2.1) is said to be sensitive in a nonempty set S ⊂ X if
there exists a constant δ > 0 such that it is sensitive at every point in S with sensitivity

0 (y0), f N

constant δ.

Remark 2.1. The concept of sensitivity in a nonempty set for system (2.1) is from Deﬁnition
2.3 in [25].

For any positive integer k, we consider another system:

xn+1 = fn(xn), n ≥ k.

(2.2)

Proposition 2.1. Let k be any positive integer and fi be continuous in X for each 0 ≤ i ≤
k − 1. If system (2.1) is sensitive at x0 with sensitivity constant δ, then system (2.2) is also
sensitive at xk with the same sensitivity constant δ.

Proof. Fix any 0 < ǫ < δ. By the continuity of fi, 0 ≤ i ≤ k − 1, there exists ǫ′ > 0 such
that

f i
0(Bǫ′(x0)) ⊂ Bǫ(xi), 1 ≤ i ≤ k.

(2.3)

Since system (2.1) is sensitive at x0 with sensitivity constant δ, there exist y0 ∈ Bǫ′(x0) and
a positive integer N such that d(f N
0 (x0)) > δ. It follows from (2.3) that N > k. So,
d(f N −k
0 (x0)) > δ. Hence, system (2.2) is sensitive at
xk with sensitivity constant δ. This completes the proof.

0 (x0))) = d(f N

Deﬁnition 2.2. Let x0 not be an isolated point in X. System (2.1) is said to be strongly
sensitive at a point x0 if there exist δ > 0 and a neighborhood U of x0 such that for any
given y0 ∈ U with y0 6= x0, d(f N
0 (x0)) > δ for some positive integer N, while δ is
called a strong sensitivity constant of system (2.1) at x0. Furthermore, system (2.1) is said
to be strongly sensitive in a nonempty set S ⊂ X without isolated points if there exists a

0 (y0), f N

constant δ > 0 such that it is strongly sensitive at every point in S with sensitivity constant
δ.

Deﬁnition 2.3. System (2.1) is said to be Lyapunov stable at x0 ∈ X if for any η > 0,
there exists δ > 0 such that d(f n
0 (x0)) ≤ η for each n ≥ 0 and any y0 ∈ X with
d(y0, x0) < δ.

0 (y0), f n

Deﬁnition 2.4. System (2.1) is said to be exponentially asymptotically stable at x0 ∈ X if
there exist positive constants δ, C, and λ such that d(f n
0 (x0)) ≤ C exp[−λn] for each
n ≥ 0 and any y0 ∈ X with d(y0, x0) < δ.

0 (y0), f n

Note that exponential asymptotical stability implies Lyapunov stability at x0 for system
(2.1) under the assumption that fk is continuous in X for each k ≥ 0; and Lyapunov stability
is exactly the inverse of sensitivity.

Deﬁnition 2.5 [25, Deﬁnition 3.2]. Assume that {Dn}∞
n=0 are two sequences
of sets in X, and hn : Dn → En is a uniformly continuous map for each n ≥ 0. The sequence
of maps {hn}∞
n=0 if for any ǫ > 0, there exists δ > 0
such that d(hn(x), hn(y)) < ǫ for all n ≥ 0 and for all x, y ∈ Dn with d(x, y) < δ.

n=0 is said to be equi-continuous in {Dn}∞

n=0 and {En}∞

Lemma 2.1. Let g : E → E ′ and fn : Dn → D′
and D′
is equi-continuous in {Dn}∞
{Dn}∞

n=0. If ∪∞

n=0.

n are nonempty sets of X. Assume that g is uniformly continuous in E and {fn}∞

n=0fn(Dn) ⊂ E, then {g ◦ fn}∞

n=0 is equi-continuous in

n, n ≥ 0, be maps, where E, E ′, Dn,

Proof. Since g is uniformly continuous in E, for any ǫ > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that
n=0 in
d(g(z1), g(z2)) < ǫ for any z1, z2 ∈ E with d(z1, z2) < δ. By the equi-continuity of {fn}∞
n=0, there exists δ1 > 0 such that for each n ≥ 0 and any x, y ∈ Dn with d(x, y) < δ1,
{Dn}∞
n=0fn(Dn) ⊂ E.
one has that d(fn(x), fn(y)) < δ, and then d(g(fn(x)), g(fn(y))) < ǫ since ∪∞
Hence {g ◦ fn}∞

n=0 is equi-continuous in {Dn}∞

n=0. This completes the proof.

The above concepts are deﬁned in general metric spaces. Next, we shall consider system

(2.1) in a non-degenerate closed interval.

In [5], Balibrea et al. extended the concept of Lyapunov exponent for a single interval

map f to a sequence of interval maps {fn}∞

n=0 by the formula:

However, the limit does not always exist in general (see Example 5.1). Inspired by the idea

given in [24] for autonomous discrete systems, we introduce the following deﬁnition:

Deﬁnition 2.6. Let I be a non-degenerate closed interval and fn : I → I be a C 1 map for
each n ≥ 0. The Lyapunov exponent of system (2.1) at a point x0 ∈ I is deﬁned by

where {xk}∞

(2.4)

n−1Xk=0

Proposition 2.2. The Lyapunov exponent of system (2.1) at x0 equals that of system (2.2)
at xk for each k ≥ 1, where {xk}∞

k=0 is the orbit of system (2.1) starting from x0.

Proof. Since the proof is trivial, its details are omitted.

3. Positive Lyapunov exponent implies strong sensitivity

In this section, we shall show that the positive Lyapunov exponent implies strong sen-

sitivity under certain conditions.

Theorem 3.1. Let I be a non-degenerate interval, fn : I → I be a C 1 map for each n ≥ 0,
n(xk)| : n, k ≥
and x0 ∈ I. Assume that {f ′

n=0 is equi-continuous in I, and M := inf{|f ′

n}∞

0} > 0. If λ(x0) > 0, then system (2.1) is strongly sensitive at x0.

Proof. Since {f ′

n}∞

n=0 is equi-continuous in I, {|f ′

n|}∞

n=0 is equi-continuous in I, and then

there exists δ0 > 0 such that for each n ≥ 0 and any x, y ∈ I with |x − y| < δ0,

(cid:12)(cid:12)|f ′

n(x)| − |f ′

n(y)|(cid:12)(cid:12) < M/2.

Set J := ∪∞
x ∈ (xk − δ0, xk + δ0) ∩ I. By (3.1) one gets that |f ′
n ≥ 0, which implies that ∪∞

k=0(xk − δ0, xk + δ0) ∩ I. For any x ∈ J, there exists some k ≥ 0 such that
n(xk)| − M/2 ≥ M/2 for each
n(x)| : x ∈ J} ⊂ [M/2, +∞). This, together with the fact
n=0 is equi-continuous in J and ln x is uniformly continuous in [M/2, +∞), yields
n|}∞
n=0 is equi-continuous in J by Lemma 2.1. So, there exists 0 < δ1 < δ0 such

that {|f ′
that {ln |f ′
that for any x, y ∈ J with |x − y| < δ1,

n(x)| > |f ′

n=0{|f ′

(3.1)

(3.2)

(cid:12)(cid:12) ln |f ′

n(x)| − ln |f ′

n(y)|(cid:12)(cid:12) < λ(x0)/2, n ≥ 0.

Suppose that system (2.1) is not strongly sensitive at x0. Then, for any 0 < η < δ1,

there exists y0 ∈ I with 0 < |y0 − x0| < η such that

|wn| = |yn − xn| ≤ η, n > 0,

(3.3)

where {xn}∞
and

n=0 and {yn}∞

n=0 are the orbits of system (2.1) starting from x0 and y0, respectively,

It is clear that one can inductively get that wn 6= 0 for each n ≥ 0. So, there exists
cn ∈ (xn, yn) (or (yn, xn)) such that

wn := yn − xn, n ≥ 0.

(3.4)

wn+1 = fn(xn + wn) − fn(xn) = f ′

n(cn)wn, n ≥ 0.

(3.5)

Then |cn − xn| ≤ |wn| ≤ η < δ1 < δ0, which implies that cn ∈ J for each n ≥ 0. It follows
from (3.2) that for each n ≥ 0,

which yields that there exists an increasing sequence {nj}∞

j=0 such that

ln |f ′

k(ck)| ≥ λ(x0) − λ(x0)/2 = λ(x0)/2,

Then there exists a positive integer k0 such that for each j ≥ k0, one has that

(3.7)

It follows from (3.5) and (3.6) that for each j ≥ k0,

|wnj +1| = |f ′

nj (cnj )| · · · |f ′

0(c0)||w0| ≥ exp[(nj + 1)λ(x0)/4]|w0|,

then |wnj +1| → ∞ as j → ∞ since λ(x0) > 0. This is a contradiction with (3.3). Therefore,
system (2.1) is strongly sensitive at x0. This completes the proof.

Remark 3.1. The result of Theorem 3.1 extends that of [16, Theorem 1] for autonomous
discrete systems to non-autonomous discrete systems. Moreover, the condition about the

k=0 ln |f ′

k(xk)|/n in [16, Theorem 1] is removed in Theorem 3.1.

existence of the limit ofPn−1

The following result shows that the positive Lyapunov exponent in a totally invariant

set implies sensitivity in this set under certain conditions.

Theorem 3.2. Let I be a non-degenerate interval, fn : I → I be a C 1 map for each n ≥ 0,
and Λ be a totally invariant subinterval in I; that is, fn(Λ) ⊂ Λ, n ≥ 0. Assume that {f ′
is equi-continuous in Λ, and there exists M > 0 such that for any x ∈ Λ, |f ′
If λ := inf x∈Λ λ(x) > 0, then system (2.1) is strongly sensitive in Λ.

Proof. With a similar argument to that used in the proof of Theorem 3.1, one can show
this theorem. The proof is complete.

4. Negative Lyapunov exponent implies exponential asymptotical stability

In this section, we shall investigate some relationship between negative Lyapunov expo-

nents and stability for a class of non-autonomous discrete systems.

n=0 is uniformly bounded in I. If
−∞ < λ(x0) < 0 and 2λ(x0) < λ0(x0), then system (2.1) is exponentially asymptotically

stable at x0.

Proof. For each n ≥ 0 and any y0 ∈ I with y0 6= x0, set

wn+1 = anwn + gn(wn),

where wn is speciﬁed in (3.4) and

an := f ′

n(xn), gn(wn) := fn(xn + wn) − fn(xn) − f ′

n(xn)wn.

(4.2)

(4.3)

(4.4)

By (4.2) one can inductively get that

wn = an−1 · · · a0w0 +

nXk=1(cid:0)an−1 · · · akgk−1(wk−1)(cid:1), n ≥ 1.

n }∞

Since {f ′′
every x ∈ I and each n ≥ 0. This, together with the second relation in (4.3), yields that

n=0 is uniformly bounded in I, there exists M > 0 such that |f ′′

n(x)| ≤ M for

|gn(wn)| ≤

1
2

M|wn|2, n ≥ 0.

(4.5)

It follows from (2.4) and (4.1) that for any ﬁxed 0 < ǫ0 < [λ0(x0) − 2λ(x0)]/3, there exists a

positive integer N0 such that

λ0(x0) − ǫ0 <

1
n

Then, for any n > k > N0, one has that

n−1Xi=0

ln |ai| < λ(x0) + ǫ0, n > N0.

|an−1 · · · ak| =

|an−1 · · · a0|
|ak−1 · · · a0|

< exp [λ(n − k) + lk],

where λ := λ(x0) + ǫ0 < 0, and lk := k[λ(x0) − λ0(x0) + 2ǫ0]. Note that |ai| > 0 for each
i ≥ 0 since λ(x0) > −∞. Because f ′
n is continuous in the closed and bounded interval I for
each n ≥ 0, it can be easily veriﬁed that there exists a constant C0 ≥ 1 depending on ǫ0 and

N0 such that for each n ≥ k ≥ 0,

|an−1 · · · ak| ≤ C0 exp [λ(n − k) + lk].

(4.6)

Then, by (4.4)–(4.6) one has that

|wn| ≤ C0 exp [λn]|w0| +

MC0

nXk=1

Next, for any η > 0, we shall inductively show that

exp [λ(n − k) + lk]|wk−1|2, n ≥ 0.

(4.7)

|wn| = |yn − xn| ≤ η exp [λn], n ≥ 0,

(4.8)

for any y0 ∈ I with |y0 − x0| < δ, where

δ := C −1

MC0η exp [−2λ] exp [eλ](cid:16)1 − exp [eλ](cid:17)−1

witheλ := 2λ(x0) − λ0(x0) + 3ǫ0 < 0.

Evidently, (4.8) holds for n = 0. Suppose that (4.8) holds for each 0 ≤ n ≤ T − 1, where
T is a positive integer. We show that there exists δ > 0, which only depends on η but not
on T , such that (4.8) holds for n = T . By the assumption, |wk−1| < η exp [λ(k − 1)] for each
1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ T . This, together with (4.7), implies that

|wn| ≤ C0 exp [λn]|w0| +

Thus by Lemma 4.1 we get that

Since λk + lk = k[2λ(x0) − λ0(x0) + 3ǫ0] = keλ, Pn
exp [eλ](1 − exp [eλ])−1. Thus, by (4.10) one has that

exp [λk + lk]), 1 ≤ n ≤ T.
k=1 exp [λk + lk] = Pn

(4.10)

k=1 exp [keλ] <

|wn| = zn exp [λn] ≤ C0|w0| exp [Dη] exp [λn], 1 ≤ n ≤ T.

In particular, |wT | ≤ C0|w0| exp [Dη] exp [λT ] < η exp [λT ]. Hence, (4.8) also holds for n = T .
Therefore, system (2.1) is exponentially asymptotically stable at x0. The proof is complete.

If the limit of (Pn−1

can be directly derived from Theorem 4.1.

k=0 ln |f ′

k(xk)|)/n exists, then λ(x0) = λ0(x0) and the following result

Corollary 4.1. Let I be a non-degenerate, closed, and bounded interval, fn : I → I be a
C 2 map for each n ≥ 0, and x0 ∈ I. Assume that {f ′′
n=0 is uniformly bounded in I. If
−∞ < λ(x0) = λ0(x0) < 0, then system (2.1) is exponentially asymptotically stable at x0.

Remark 4.1. The result of Corollary 4.1 extends that of [16, Theorem 4] for autonomous
systems to non-autonomous systems.

5. An example

Consider the following non-autonomous logistic system:

xn+1 = rnxn(1 − xn), n ≥ 0,

(5.1)

governed by the maps fn(x) = rnx(1 − x), x ∈ I := [0, 1]. Let 0 < rn ≤ 4, n ≥ 0. Then
fn(I) ⊂ I for each n ≥ 0.

It is evident that for each n ≥ 0, fn is C 2 in I, f ′

n(x) = rn(1 − 2x), and f ′′

n (x) = −2rn.

Clearly, 0 is a ﬁxed point of system (5.1) and f ′

n(0) = rn, n ≥ 0, which results in

λ(0) = lim sup

n→∞

ln rk.

(5.2)

The limit of (Pn−1

k=0 ln rk)/n may not exist. However, its upper limit exists. Hence, the

upper limit used in Deﬁnition 2.6 is reasonable in this case.

L > 1 and |f ′′

In the case that L ≤ rn ≤ 4, n ≥ 0, where L > 1 is a constant, one has that |f ′

n(0)| ≥
n=0 is equi-continuous in I. It follows
from (5.2) that λ(0) ≥ ln L > 0. Hence, all the assumptions in Theorem 3.1 hold for system
(5.1) with x0 = 0. Therefore, system (5.1) is strongly sensitive at 0 in this case.

n (x)| = 2rn ≤ 8 for all n ≥ 0. So {f ′

n}∞

In the case that 0 < a ≤ rn ≤ b < 1, n ≥ 0, where a and b are positive constants with

b2 < a, by (5.2) we get that

λ(0) ≤ ln b < 0, λ0(0) ≥ ln a > −∞.

(5.3)

Since b2 < a, it follows from (5.3) that

2λ(0) − λ0(0) ≤ 2 ln b − ln a = ln(b2/a) < 0.

Moreover, |f ′′

n (x)| = 2rn < 2 for each n ≥ 0, which yields that {f ′′

n=0 is uniformly bounded
in I. Hence, all the assumptions in Theorem 4.1 hold for system (5.1) with x0 = 0. Therefore,
system (5.1) is exponentially asymptotically stable at 0.
