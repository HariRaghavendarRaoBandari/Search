Cosmic Dust VII

For dust you are and to dust you will return.

1. Interdisciplinary research on cosmic dust

Cosmic dust has long been recognized to play a key role in
astronomy, especially in planetary science, space science, as-
trophysics, astrochemistry, astrobiology, and astromineralogy.
The reason for its crucial importance is that it has been found
essentially in all the environments where the temperature is low
enough for gases to condense into solids. Dust carries critical
information on the medium where it is observed and acts as a
fantastic probe into the physical properties and chemical condi-
tions of various astronomical objects. Over the years, each as-
tronomical community has naturally developed its own observ-
ing strategies, laboratory equipment, models, numerical codes,
etc. As a consequence, it has become a real challenge of the
present day to get a consistent and global picture of such con-
siderably diverse approaches using cosmic dust as a tool, de-
spite the broadly shared interest in it.

A series of Cosmic Dust meetings1 provides a unique op-
portunity to overcome this diﬃculty. These meetings cover the
widest range of cosmic dust research in the world by gather-
ing experts from diﬀerent ﬁelds in astronomy with the goal to
share their best knowledge of dust. Since 2006, we have been
organizing the Cosmic Dust meetings in Asia, every time with a
small number of invited experts from various ﬁelds of dust, to-
gether with a limited number of contributed experts. The basic
format of the meeting is made up of 50–60 selected attendees
and ample time for both scientiﬁc discussion and the develop-
ment of interpersonal relationships during long coﬀee breaks
and enjoyable evening events. A banquet and a half-day excur-
sion also contribute to making these meetings a pleasant mo-
ment, and providing a very speciﬁc place to trigger new projects
and come up with emerging new ideas. Therefore, the overall
atmosphere of the meetings is conducive to establishing long-
term relationships and possible collaborations across scientiﬁc
disciplines.

The 7th meeting on Cosmic Dust (hereafter “Cosmic Dust
VII”) was held at the Umeda Satellite Campus of Osaka Sangyo
University, Japan, from August 4 to 8, 2014. It was fortunate for
us that we could have a great list of invited speakers year after
year from a broad range of research ﬁelds. The invited speak-
ers of Cosmic Dust VII were Michael F. A’Hearn (University of

versity of Helsinki, Finland), Michael S. P. Kelley (University
of Maryland, USA), Antonio Mario Magalh˜aes (University of

Takashi Onaka (University of Tokyo, Japan), Aur´elie R´emy-
Ruyer (CEA Saclay, France), and Toru Yada (ISAS/JAXA,
Japan). They gave outstanding 40-min talks covering various
themes as described in the next section, and served as excel-
lent chairpersons and members of the panel for the best poster
contest. The Best Poster Award of Cosmic Dust VII was re-
ceived by Shoji Mori for his paper entitled “Interplay between
dust and MHD turbulence in protoplanetary disks: Electric-
ﬁeld heating of plasmas and its eﬀect on the ionization balance
of dusty disks” (Mori and Okuzumi, 2014). Successful con-
tributed speakers presented their recent work through either a
20-min talk or a poster with a 1-min introductory talk prior to
the ﬁrst poster session. The posters were displayed throughout
the meeting for intensive discussion along with extended coﬀee
breaks that lasted for 1 h every time following each 1-h oral ses-
sion. The abstracts of the talks and the posters presented at the
meeting are available for download at the Cosmic Dust web-
site (https://www.cps-jp.org/˜dust/Program VII.html). Fig. 1 is
a group shot of the participants taken immediately after the ban-
quet, held on the Dojima waterfront of the Aqua Metropolis
Osaka.

This special issue in Planetary and Space Science (PSS) is
aimed at collecting the new results and original ideas that were
presented at Cosmic Dust VII in 2014. We are pleased that this
issue also includes relevant papers from scientists outside the
meeting attendees, so that it warrants total coverage of the most
recent ﬁndings (Krełowski, 2015; Moores et al., 2015). In Sec-
tion 2, we shall overview the papers presented at Cosmic Dust
VII, since the reader is not necessarily familiar with the sub-
ject of this volume. The papers are classiﬁed into subsections
according to their dusty environments in the same way as the
program of the meeting, although we admit that the classiﬁca-
tion is not unique. Section 3 brieﬂy describes our perspectives
for the development of cosmic dust research and ends with our
concluding remarks.

2. The contents of Cosmic Dust VII

2.1. Solar system

Comets are the oldest fossils of primitive ices and dust at the
early stages of the Solar System formation, while their surfaces

are processed by solar radiation (Whipple, 1950). In a classical
picture of comets, the sublimation of water ice near the surface
of a nucleus in the inner Solar System is a driving force for
water molecules to drag dust from the surface and accelerate
it until it decouples in the outer coma. Michael F. A’Hearn re-
ported that the picture has drastically changed within the last ten
years, owing to the advent of infrared space telescopes, space
missions to comets, and advances in the theory of Solar System
formation (A’Hearn, 2014). It turns out that water molecules are
released primarily in the coma from large chunks of nearly pure
ice and do not drag dust from the surface (A’Hearn et al., 2011).
In addition, the chunks, which are most likely ﬂuﬀy porous ag-
gregates of 1 µm water ice grains, are found to exist separately
from dark material (Protopapa et al., 2014). This is totally
dissimilar from a model of icy grains proposed by Greenberg
(1998), in which water ice covers dark refractory grains. The
separation of icy grains and non-icy, refractory grains has also
been observed in a protoplanetary disk as a temporal variation
in the 3 µm water ice absorption against a constant dust contin-
uum (Terada et al., 2007). Therefore, recent observations sug-
gest that icy grains and refractory grains are separately present
in protoplanetary and debris disks, as well as comets. It is clear
that these ﬁndings shed new light on the formation of icy grains,
if the majority of water ice in comets does not form on the sur-
faces of refractory grains.

et al., 2015).

2.2. Debris disks

Infrared space observatories such as Spitzer and Herschel
have provided valuable spectral data of debris disks at diﬀer-
ent stages of evolution. Johan Olofsson addressed dust miner-
alogy in debris disks as well as protoplanetary disks in terms
of disk evolution and planet formation (Olofsson et al., 2014).
The spectral decomposition of the data relies on, to a great
extent, laboratory measurements of infrared spectra with syn-
thesized or natural terrestrial grains. Among the emission fea-
tures of crystalline olivine, the 69 µm feature has been used as
an indicator of the grain temperature and the iron fraction in
olivine grains (e.g., Koike et al., 2006). It is, however, worth

2

mentioning that the spectral decomposition of debris disks of-
ten does not incorporate the knowledge of dust mineralogy ac-
quired through in situ and laboratory analyses of real dust sam-
ples from comets, despite the similarity of their infrared spectra.
Laboratory measurements of the 69 µm feature were performed
with pure olivine grains, but the absence of pure olivine grains
is a consensus on dust mineralogy in comets. In-situ measure-
ments of element abundances for dust in Comet 1P/Halley re-
vealed that olivine is always associated with organic refractory
material without exception (Jessberger et al., 1988). Labora-
tory analyses of dust particles captured from Comet 81P/Wild
2 have revealed the presence of minerals as well as high-mass
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) associated with whole
particles, despite the fact that organics suﬀered from destruc-
tion and loss during the capture and the analyses (Brownlee et
al., 2006; Sandford et al., 2006). The chondritic porous sub-
set of interplanetary dust particles (IDPs), which is most likely
of cometary origin, shows that mineral grains are embedded
in organic-rich carbonaceous material (e.g., Flynn et al., 2013).
The organic coating of mineral grains is similarly found in IDPs
collected during the passage of Earth through the dust trail of
Comet 26P/Grigg-Skjellerup (Busemann et al., 2009). There-
fore, the 69 µm feature depends not only on the grain temper-
ature and the iron fraction in olivine, but also on the volume
fraction of organic material and the carbonization degree of the
organic material (Kimura, 2014).2 Accordingly, we conclude
that dust mineralogy in debris disks needs revision in order to
correctly interpret the infrared spectra of debris disks, unless
debris-disk dust is totally dissimilar to comet dust.

gates of spheres by Ludmilla Kolokolova; numerical modeling
of light-scattering cross sections for aggregates of spheres by

formation of hot debris disks by Hiroshi Kobayashi; adaptive-

2.3. Protoplanetary disks and star-forming regions

Icy mantles on grains in the form of H2O, CO, CO2, and or-
ganic molecules are the repository for a signiﬁcant amount of
oxygen and carbon in star-forming regions and dark molecu-
lar clouds. With the advent of the Infrared Space Observatory
and the Spitzer Space Telescope, our understanding of the for-
mation and evolution of interstellar ices have been dramatically
improved. Erika Gibb reviewed our current knowledge about
ice mantles in various environments ranging from dark molecu-
lar clouds to protoplanetary disks to comets (Gibb, 2014). Spe-
cial attention was paid to how ices evolve from initial freeze-
out in dark clouds through the star formation process and po-
tential incorporation into comets. A comparison of molecu-
lar abundances between low-mass protostars and comets re-
veals noticeable diﬀerences in their abundances, suggestive of

patible with infrared spectroscopic observations of so-called “olivine” features
(e.g., Fabian et al., 2001).

ice processing in the solar nebula ( ¨Oberg et al., 2011).
It is
highly unlikely that interstellar ice mantles alone were incor-
porated into comets, since the grain cores of interstellar ori-
gin are not present in cometary dust (cf. Keller and Messenger,
2011). Therefore, the diﬀerences in protostellar and cometary
ice abundances may indicate that protostellar ices sublimate and
then re-condense in protoplanetary disks as icy grains.

ics simulation of gas and dust in protoplanetary disks by Jean-
Franc¸ois Gonzalez (Gonzalez et al., 2015); a comprehensive

photometry of massive star-forming regions by Yasuki Hattori
(Hattori et al., 2015); a theoretical study of the eﬀect of grain
growth on star formation in low-metallicity collapsing clouds
by Gen Chiaki.

2.4. Interstellar medium

The evolution of amorphous carbon materials due to pro-
cessing by UV radiation and shocks in the ISM is the key to
best understanding the variations in the observed properties of
interstellar dust, as claimed by Jones (2014) in the last meet-
ing (Cosmic Dust VI). Takashi Onaka reviewed the results of
the latest infrared observations of interstellar dust with the re-
cent infrared satellites: Spitzer, Herschel, and AKARI (Onaka,
2014; Onaka et al., 2015). AKARI observations of PAH emis-
sion features have clearly shown the variations in the size distri-
bution and properties of carbonaceous dust due to processing by
UV radiation or shocks. The aliphatic/aromatic ratios of PAHs
are found to systematically decrease with the ionization frac-
tion in Galactic star-forming regions of more than 100 samples,
indicating that carbonaceous dust is aromatized in the ISM due
to UV radiation accompanied by photo-fragmentation. In ex-
ternal galaxies, PAHs are signiﬁcantly enhanced in intergalac-
tic regions shocked by galactic superwind and galaxy merger,
suggesting that PAHs most likely originate from shock frag-
mentation of large submicrometer-sized carbonaceous grains.
While the observed PAH characteristics could be reasonably
well understood in the theoretical framework of amorphous car-
bon evolution in the ISM, the reader is referred to the paper
by Kaneda et al. (2014) for more AKARI results on PAHs and
carbonaceous dust. It is worth noting that there are a couple

3

of space missions probing the physical and chemical proper-
ties of interstellar dust. However, the direct detection of small
aromatic-rich carbonaceous interstellar grains in the Solar Sys-
tem is of great diﬃculty, if not impossible. In comparison to
large silicate grains, these small carbonaceous grains are sub-
ject to external forces in the solar radiation and magnetic ﬁelds
and may not reach the inner Solar System, which is currently
accessible to space missions. Consequently, it is most likely
that laboratory analyses of interstellar dust samples collected
by Stardust do not provide a comprehensive picture of interstel-
lar dust composition.

millimeter observations of interstellar dust in dense clouds by
Mika Juvela (Juvela, 2015); a thorough survey of interstellar
polarization data in optical, near-infrared, and millimeter wave-
lengths by Antonio Mario Magalh˜aes; an experimental develop-
ment of C60 production by Abel Brieva; a ﬁtting of AKARI data

ultraviolet to optical interstellar extinction in terms of the con-
tribution of carbon dust by Ajay Mishra; ﬂuid dynamics simula-
tion of interstellar gas and dust by Tom Hendrix; dust emission
modeling of infrared cirrus at high Galactic latitudes by Ajay
Mishra.

2.5. Evolved stars and supernovae

A supernova (SN) is an explosion of a massive supergiant
star at its latest stage and is known to seed stardust into the
surrounding ISM. Takaya Nozawa presented observational de-
tections and theoretical modeling of dust formation in SNe and
supernova remnants (SNRs) (Nozawa, 2014). Although the to-
tal dust mass produced by a single supernova is one order of
magnitude higher than that of AGB stars, the mass supply rate
of dust from SNe into the ISM is comparable to that of AGB
stars. SNe produce submicrometer-sized amorphous silicate
grains in their ejecta due to rapid cooling, while oxygen-rich
˙M > 3 × 10−8 M(cid:12)
AGB stars with high-mass loss rates of
produce crystalline silicate grains (Cami et al., 1998). Anal-
yses of interstellar dust returned to Earth by the Stardust mis-
sion revealed the presence of micrometer-sized grains with a
forsteritic olivine core and an amorphous silicate mantle in the
local ISM (Westphal et al., 2014). Another micrometer-sized
particle of the Stardust samples is possibly silicon carbide and
the other submicrometer-sized grains seem to be characterized
by aggregates of magnesium-rich, iron-bearing silicates. We
notice that micrometer-sized grains and submicrometer-sized
grains in the Stardust interstellar dust samples do not contra-
dict our understandings of condensates in AGB stars and SNe,
respectively. In contrast, a simple “classical” picture of inter-
stellar dust such as a model by Draine and Lee (1984) appears

diﬀerent, although carbonaceous grains might be ﬁltered oﬀ at
the heliospheric boundary. As a result, a proper mixture of
grains formed in SNe as well as oxygen-rich and carbon-rich
AGB stars are required to satisfactorily model the interstellar
dust populations, by taking into account their processing in the
ISM.

Other papers covered the following topics: near-infrared
observations of the supernova remnant IC443 by Takuma
Kokusho (Kokusho et al., 2015); a laboratory study on the in-
frared spectra of wustite samples by Chiyoe Koike; laboratory
infrared spectral in situ measurements of nucleating silicate
nanoparticles by Shinnosuke Ishizuka.

2.6. Galaxies

Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are the central regions of galax-
ies where a supermassive black hole accretes gas and dust, and
releases substantial energy as radiation. Dust is the cornerstone
of the uniﬁcation theory of AGN, in which all AGN are essen-
tially the same object but look diﬀerent, depending on sightlines
(Antonucci, 1993). Namely, much of the observed diversity
arises from diﬀerent viewing angles toward the central engine
and a dusty toroidal structure around it. When the dusty torus
is viewed face-on, both the central engine and the broad-line
regions can be seen directly causing objects to appear as type 1
AGN; When the dusty torus is viewed edge-on, the anisotropic
obscuration created by the torus causes objects to appear as type
2 AGN. Rachel Mason reviewed our current understanding of
the chemical makeup of the dust torus, the destruction and for-
mation of dust in the torus, and its possible roles in both inﬂow
to and outﬂow from the nucleus (Mason, 2015). The 10 µm
silicate feature is naively expected to appear in emission and
absorption toward type 1 and 2 objects, respectively, but there
are outliers, namely, type 1 AGN with silicate absorption and
type 2 AGN with silicate emission. The distributions of the
10 µm feature strength including the outliers are well explained
if the torus does not have a smooth density distributions, but
is a clumpy medium consisting of optically thick dusty clouds
(Nikutta et al., 2009). The 10 µm emission feature from the hot
surfaces of directly illuminated clouds on the inner side of the
torus is characteristic of amorphous silicate grains, even though
the hottest grains are located in the vicinity of their sublimation
zone. This may indicate that silicate grains under harsh en-
vironments of AGN undergo amorphization in a much shorter
timescale than crystallization.

tions of cold dust in galaxies by Aur´elie R´emy-Ruyer; AKARI

3. Perspectives for the development of cosmic dust research

Acknowledgements

The rationale behind the meeting is a development of cos-
mic dust research by an interdisciplinary approach to answer
the questions of where dust comes from and where dust goes
(see Kimura et al., 2014). We are pleased that several presenta-
tions in Cosmic Dust VII extended the studies across diﬀerent
environments of dust and ices in terms of their evolution and
processing (e.g., Olofsson et al., 2014; Gibb, 2014). These are
promising works in the development of cosmic dust research,
as an interdisciplinary research is essential in achieving great
scientiﬁc advances in the cosmic dust ﬁeld.

By looking back on Cosmic Dust VII, we could link sev-
eral presentations together to gain a new insight into the forma-
tion and evolution of dust and ices. The surfaces of dust parti-
cles provide a vital role in the formation of major molecules
observed in a variety of environments such as cometary co-
mae, protoplanetary disks, the interstellar medium, and galax-
ies. The abundances of CH3OH, CH4, and CO with respect
to H2O in low-mass protostars are clearly higher than those in
comets, which is so far interpreted by processing in protoplan-
etary disks (Gibb, 2014). The average abundance of solid CO2
relative to solid H2O in low-mass protostellar envelopes is close
to 0.3, which is higher than the value around 0.2 found in dense
molecular clouds and massive star-forming regions (Pontopp-
idan et al., 2008). It turned out in the meeting that the ratios
of CO2 to H2O ice abundances in comets and nearby galaxies
lie in the range of 0.05–0.30 (A’Hearn, 2014; Yamagishi et al.,
2014). Once CO2 molecules are created either on the surface
of refractory grains or in the gas phase, the molecules are sta-
ble against chemical reactions that could reduce the abundance
of the molecules. Yamagishi et al. (2014) have shown that the
variation of the CO2/H2O ratio in nearby galaxies seems to re-
sult from its dependence on the irradiation of ultraviolet pho-
tons induced by cosmic rays. If the CO2/H2O ratio is a good
tracer for the hardness of the UV radiation ﬁeld, the CO2/H2O
ratio in comets might provide a clue about the location where
comets were formed in the solar nebula. However, the discov-
ery of pure icy grains in comets may violate the common belief
that H2O and CO2 molecules cannot be eﬃciently formed in
the gas phase and thus the surface of dust acts as a catalyst for
the formation of these molecules. It is, therefore, essential to
rethink the formation of icy grains in protoplanetary disks from
diﬀerent angles, which will hopefully be addressed in the next
meeting.

We cordially invite the reader to take part in the 8th meeting
on Cosmic Dust (Cosmic Dust VIII)3 and to join us for the de-
velopment of cosmic dust research. Cosmic Dust VIII will be
held at the Tokyo Skytree Town Campus of Chiba Institute of
Technology, Tokyo, Japan on August 17–21, 2015. The dead-
line for admissions application is May 13, 2015, but early birds
who complete both admissions application and abstract submis-
sion by April 30, 2015 will receive a discount on the registration
fee. More information on Cosmic Dust VIII is available at the
