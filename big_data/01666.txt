ABSTRACT

In the last decade, the photospheric abundances of the Sun had been revised several times by
many observers. The standard solar models (SSM) constructed with the new low-metal abun-
dances disagree with helioseismic results and detected neutrino ﬂuxes. The solar model problem
has been puzzled some stellar physicists for more than ten years. Rotation, enhanced diﬀusion,
convection overshoot, and magnetic ﬁelds are used to reconcile the new abundances with helio-
seismology. The too low-helium subsurface abundance in enhanced diﬀusion models can be
improved by the mixing caused by rotation and magnetic ﬁelds. The problem of the depth of
the convective zone in rotating models can be resolved by convection overshoot. Consequently
the Asplund-Grevesse-Sauval rotation model including overshooting (AGSR) reproduces the seis-
mically inferred sound-speed and density proﬁles, and the convection zone depth as well as the
Grevesse and Sauval (GS98) model computed before. But this model fails to reproduce the sur-
face helium abundance which is 0.2393 (2.6 σ away from the seismic value) and neutrino ﬂuxes.
The magnetic model called AGSM keeps the agreement of the AGSR and improves the predic-
tion of the surface helium abundance. The observed separation ratios r02 and r13 are reasonably
reproduced by AGSM. Moreover, neutrino ﬂuxes calculated by this model are not far from the
detected neutrino ﬂuxes and the predictions of previous works.

Introduction

1.1. The constraints of helioseismology

Since Lodders (2003) and Asplund et al. (2004,
2005) revised the ratio of heavy-element abun-
dance to hydrogen abundance of the Sun (Z/X)
from the old 0.023 (Grevesse & Sauval 1998, here-
after GS98) to 0.0177 (Lodders 2003) or 0.0165
(Asplund et al. 2005, hereafter AGS05), the solar
model problem (or the solar abundance problem)
that standard solar models (SSM) constructed
with the AGS05 mixtures disagree with the seis-
mically inferred sound-speed and density pro-
ﬁles, convection zone (CZ) depth, and CZ helium
abundance has been perplexed some solar physi-
cists, see Turck-Chi`eze et al. (2004). The seis-
mically inferred CZ base radius is 0.713 ± 0.003
R⊙ (Christensen-Dalsgaard et al. 1991) or 0.713±

0.001 R⊙ (Basu & Antia 1997), and CZ helium
abundance is 0.2485 ± 0.0035 (Basu & Antia 2004;
Serenelli & Basu 2010).

Many models have been proposed to resolve the
problem. It was found that a 11%−20% increase
in OPAL opacities at the base of the CZ (BCZ)
can reconcile the low-Z models with helioseismol-
ogy (Basu & Antia 2004; Montalb´an et al. 2004;
Bahcall et al. 2004).
However, Badnell et al.
(2005) and Guzik et al. (2005) showed that the
increase in the opacities is no more than about
3.0% near the BCZ. Antia & Basu (2005) and
Bahcall et al. (2005) found that an increase in
neon abundance along with small increases in the
other abundances could solve the problem with
AGS05 models. However, Schmelz et al. (2005)
and Young (2005) showed that the Ne/O ra-
tio is indeed consistent with the value given by
AGS05. Asplund et al. (2004) suggested that in-

1

creased diﬀusion and settling of helium and heavy
elements might be able to resolve these disagree-
ments. Several groups, e.g., Basu & Antia (2004),
Montalb´an et al. (2004), Guzik et al. (2005), and
Yang & Bi (2007) considered the eﬀects of en-
hanced diﬀusion. They found that enhanced dif-
fusion depletes the CZ helium abundance to well
below the seismically inferred value and leaves the
position of the BCZ too shallow.

Recently, Lodders (2009), Asplund et al. (2009),
and Caﬀau et al. (2010) reevaluated the spec-
troscopic abundances of the Sun. The heavy-
element abundance was revised to Z/X = 0.0181
and Z = 0.0134 (Asplund et al. 2009, hereafter
AGS09), Z/X = 0.0191 and Z = 0.0141 (Lodders
2009), and Z/X = 0.0211 and Z = 0.0154
(Caﬀau et al. 2010). Compared to the SSMs
with GS98 mixtures, solar models constructed
in accordance to the AGS09 mixtures also dis-
agree with the seismically inferred sound-speed
and density proﬁles, CZ depth, and CZ helium
abundance (Serenelli et al. 2009; Serenelli & Basu
2010; Serenelli et al. 2011; Guzik et al. 2010;
Bi et al. 2011; Turck-Chi`eze et al. 2010, 2011;
Lopes & Turck-Chi`eze 2013, 2014; Le Pennec et al.
2015). The conclusion has been that it is diﬃcuilt
to match simultaneously the new Z/X and he-
lioseismic constraints for sound-speed and density
proﬁles, CZ depth, and CZ helium abundance.
A resolution to the solar model problem remains
elusive.

The hypothesis of a large error in the new
photospheric abundance estimate has now been
ruled out (Lodders 2009; Asplund et al. 2009;
Caﬀau et al. 2010). Assuming accretion of metal-
poor gas at the beginning of the main sequence of
the Sun, Castro et al. (2007), Guzik et al. (2010),
and Serenelli et al. (2011) found that the sound-
speed proﬁle of accretion model matches very well
that of the GS98 SSM below R/R⊙ = 0.5, but
the bump below the CZ remains quite prominent.
Furthermore, the CZ depth of the accretion model
is too shallow. Moreover, Serenelli et al. (2011)
considered accretion of metal-rich gas. Metal-rich
accretion can bring the depth of the CZ into agree-
ment with the seismic value, but that the resulting
surface He abundance in such models is too low.
The eﬀects of a convective overshoot were con-
sidered by Montalb´an et al. (2006), Castro et al.
(2007), and Guzik et al. (2010). The overshoot

2

below the CZ allows Montalb´an et al. (2006) and
Castro et al. (2007) to recover the good CZ radius
but can not improve sound-speed and surface He
abundance (Montalb´an et al. 2006; Castro et al.
2007; Guzik et al. 2010). Moreover, the CZ radius
of overshoot model of Guzik et al. (2010) is not in
agreement with the seismic value; and the eﬀects
of a convective overshoot does not inhibit He diﬀu-
sion (Guzik et al. 2010). Guzik et al. (2010) also
considered the eﬀects of mass loss. They found
that the sound-speed agreement is considerably
improved by including early mass loss. But the
CZ depth is still too low.

Turck-Chi`eze et al. (2010) constructed dynam-
ical solar models including a detailed transport of
angular momentum and chemicals due to inter-
nal rotation that includes meridional circulation
and shear-induced turbulence. They found that
the impact of the rotation on the solar structure
is rather small, and the sound speed is only very
slightly modiﬁed when internal rotation is intro-
duced with respect to the measured internal ro-
tation proﬁle. Their work sustains the idea that
the Sun was not at the beginning a rapid rota-
tor, and that other dynamical processes should
be included to better reproduce the observed so-
lar proﬁle and to better describe the young ac-
tive Sun. Furthermore, Turck-Chi`eze et al. (2011)
concluded that about 20% of the present discrep-
ancy could come from the incorrect description of
the early phase of the Sun, its activity, its initial
mass, and mass-loss history. Turck-Chi`eze et al.
(2011) also found that the solar initial mass could
have been larger by 20%−30% than the present so-
lar mass, and that the Sun could have transformed
about 2.5% − 4% of the energy produced dur-
ing the early evolutionary stages into other form
of energy through kinetic and magnetic energies.
Turck-Chi`eze et al. (2011) put forward an impor-
tant view that a transformation of nuclear energy
into kinetic and magnetic energies during the solar
life must be considered. Zhang (2014) found that
the density proﬁle below the CZ is sensitive to the
turbulent kinetic ﬂux, which supports the view of
Turck-Chi`eze et al. (2011).

Moreover, Le Pennec et al. (2015) constructed
a standard solar model with the new OPAS opac-
ity tables. Their results show that OPAS opaci-
ties improve the sound-speed proﬁle but the bump
below the CZ remains quite prominent (see their

Figures 3 and 4).

1.2. The neutrino ﬂux constraints

In the last decade,

important progress has
been made in the detection of neutrinos
(Ahmed et al. 2004; Bellini et al. 2011, 2012)
and in the prediction of
solar neutrino
ﬂuxes (Turck-Chi`eze et al. 2001, 2004, 2010;
Turck-Chi`eze & Couvidat 2011; Turck-Chi`eze & Lopes
2012; Bahcall et al. 2001; Bahcall & Pinsonneault
2004; Couvidat et al. 2003; Lopes & Turck-Chi`eze
2013, 2014). The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory
conﬁrmed the existence of solar neutrino oscilla-
tions (Ahmed et al. 2004). The 8B, 7Be, pp, and
pep neutrino ﬂuxes were determined (Ahmed et al.
2004; Bellini et al. 2011, 2012).

Seismic observations constrain mainly the ex-
ternal layers of the Sun and the internal seis-
mic sound speed, but neutrino ﬂuxes probe
the real center of the Sun.
Neutrinos have
complemented helioseismology in diagnosing the
structure of the Sun (Turck-Chi`eze et al. 2011;
Turck-Chi`eze & Lopes 2012). The boron neutrino
ﬂux is strongly dependent on solar central temper-
ature (Couvidat et al. 2003; Turck-Chi`eze et al.
2010; Turck-Chi`eze & Lopes 2012). The pep neu-
trino ﬂux is dramatically dependent on the lumi-
nosity of the Sun. Therefore, it represents a pow-
erful probe of the physics of the nuclear region of
the Sun, in parallel to the information introduced
in the seismic model (Turck-Chi`eze & Lopes 2012;
Lopes & Turck-Chi`eze 2013). Thus neutrinos pro-
vide a direct constraint on the solar core, see the
review of Turck-Chi`eze & Couvidat (2011).

The solar neutrinos have been used to diag-
nose the temperature proﬁle in the Sun’s core,
measure the radial electronic density of mat-
ter of
the Sun (Turck-Chi`eze & Lopes 2012;
Lopes & Turck-Chi`eze 2013) and the strength of
magnetic ﬁeld in the radiative region (Couvidat et al.
2003), and look for standing g-modes of the Sun
(Lopes & Turck-Chi`eze 2014).

1.3. The uncertainties on the elemental

diﬀusion and mixing

The rates of element diﬀusion are enhanced by
applying a straight multiplier to the diﬀusion ve-
locity, as has been done by Basu & Antia (2004),
Montalb´an et al. (2004), Guzik et al. (2005), and

3

Yang & Bi (2007). The theoretical error of the
gravitational settling rate is of the order of about
15% (Thoul, Bahcall & Loeb 1994). Our multi-
pliers of the diﬀusion coeﬃcients are very high,
despite the fact that there is no obvious physi-
cal justiﬁcation for such high multipliers, as has
been pointed out by Basu & Antia (2004) and
Guzik et al. (2005).

Gravitational settling reduces the surface he-
lium abundance by roughly 10% (≈ 0.03 by
mass fraction) below its initial value but this
estimate is still subjected to great uncertainties
(Proﬃtt & Michaud 1991). Thoul, Bahcall & Loeb
(1994) ﬁnd the same order of magnitude but state
that the eﬀects of meridional circulation and of
turbulent mixing are ignored in their models.
Proﬃtt & Michaud (1991) estimated the eﬀect of
turbulent mixing on gravitational settling. They
found that turbulent mixing could partly inhibit
the settling of helium by about 40%. Their tur-
bulent diﬀusion coeﬃcient is very diﬀerent from
those given by Pinsonneault et al. (1989) and
Zahn et al. (1997).
Proﬃtt & Michaud (1991)
concluded that it is unlikely that turbulent mixing
of any kind can reduce the amount of surface He
settling in solar models by more than a factor of
2 below that calculated for pure diﬀusion models.
Turck-Chi`eze et al. (2010) ﬁnds that rotational
mixing has a limited eﬀect on the diﬀusion
for realistic internal rotation rate.

The observed subsurface mass fraction of he-
lium is 0.2485±0.035 (Basu & Antia 2004). As the
initial helium abundance of the Sun varies between
0.273 ± 0.006 and 0.278 ± 0.006 (Serenelli & Basu
2010), the roughly 10% reduction in the surface
helium abundance is generally required in many
best solar models, such as BP00 (Bahcall et al.
2001), BP04 (Bahcall & Pinsonneault 2004), and
SSeM (Couvidat et al. 2003), to reproduce seis-
mic results. So, in order to keep such surface he-
lium abundance, the rate of element diﬀusion must
be enhanced in our rotating models. Guzik et al.
(2005), Basu & Antia (2008), Turck-Chi`eze et al.
(2011) and Le Pennec et al. (2015) also pointed
out that there may be an insuﬃcient treatment
of the microscopic diﬀusion.

In order to restore agreement between seis-
mic constraints and models that are constructed
with the AGS09 abundances, based on the ro-
tating models of Pinsonneault et al. (1989) and

Yang & Bi (2007),
the combinations of diﬀu-
sion, rotation, convection overshoot, and magnetic
ﬁelds are considered in this work.

The eﬀects of rotation on the structure and evo-
lution of stars include centrifugal eﬀect and rota-
tional mixing (Pinsonneault et al. 1989; Yang & Bi
2006; Turck-Chi`eze et al. 2010; Yang et al. 2013a,b).
The mechanisms of rotational mixing, considered
in this work, include the hydrodynamical instabil-
ities (Pinsonneault et al. 1989) and secular shear
instability (Zahn et al. 1997).

The overshoot of convection extends the region
of chemical mixing by a distance δovHp below the
BCZ that is determined by Schwarzchild criterion,
where Hp is the local pressure scaleheight and δov
is a free parameter. The full mixing of chemical
compositions is assumed in the overshoot region
in our models. The paper is organized as follow:
the properties of the diﬀerent solar models are pre-
sented in section 2, results are given in section 3,
a discussion and summary in section 4.

2. Proposed Solar Models

The solar models are computed by using Yale
Rotation Evolution Code
(Pinsonneault et al.
1989; Guenther et al. 1992; Yang & Bi 2007)
in its rotation and non-rotation conﬁgurations.
The OPAL equation-of-state (EOS2005) tables
(Rogers & Nayfonov 2002) and OPAL opacity
tables (Iglesias & Rogers 1996) were used, sup-
plemented by the Ferguson et al. (2005) opacity
tables at low temperature. The opacity tables
were reconstructed using GS98 or AGS09 mix-
tures. The low-temperature opacity tables with
AGS09 mixtures were computed by Ferguson for
Serenelli et al. (2009). Convection is treated ac-
cording to the standard mixing-length theory. The
diﬀusion and settling of both helium and heavy
elements are computed by using the diﬀusion co-
eﬃcients of Thoul, Bahcall & Loeb (1994). All
models are calibrated to the present solar radius
6.9598 × 1010 cm, luminosity 3.844 × 1033 erg s−1,
mass 1.9891 × 1010 g, and age 4.57 Gyr. The ini-
tial Xinit and Zinit, and mixing-length parameter
α are adjusted to match the constraints of lumi-
nosity and radius within about 10−4. The values
of the parameters are summarized in Table 1.

The nuclear reaction rates were evaluated
with the subroutine of Bahcall & Pinsonneault

4

(1992), updated by Bahcall et al. (1995) and
Bahcall et al.
(2001) using the reaction data
in Adelberger et al. (1998), Gruzinov & Bahcall
(1998), and Marcucci et al. (2000).

Following Li & Soﬁa (2001), we use the toroidal
(Bt) and poloidal (Bp) components to express a
magnetic ﬁled vector B = (Bt, Bp). We assume
|Bt| ≫ |Bp| in the radiative region. The magnetic
energy density variable χ is deﬁned as

χ = (B2/8π)/ρ,

(1)

t + B2

where B = (B2
p)1/2 is the magnitude of the
magnetic ﬁeld vector. The magnetic pressure Pχ
can be written as

Pχ = χρ.

The total pressure PT is written as

PT = P + Pχ.

nal energy UT = U + χ and the total entropy

0 and 1 (Yang & Bi 2006, 2008), respectively.
The strength and spatiotemporal distribution of
magnetic ﬁelds inside a star are poorly known.
Yang & Bi (2006) assumed that B2
p/B2 is a con-
stant. Due to |Bt| ≫ |Bp|, here we take |B| ≈ |Bt|.
The magnetic ﬁeld compositions |Bt| and |Bp| in
the radiative region are calculated by using equa-
tions (22) and (23) of Spruit (2002). The values
of fΩ and fc are shown in Table 1.

Solid body rotation is assumed in the CZ.
And the distribution of the magnitude of mag-
netic ﬁelds is assumed to be a Gaussian proﬁle
(Li & Soﬁa 2001) in the CZ, i.e.,

B = BBCZ exp[−

1
2

(r − rBCZ )2/σ2],

(10)

where the BBCZ is determined by the equations
of Spruit (2002). The magnitude of BBCZ is of
the order of about 2 × 103 Gauss. The value
of the σ is equal to 0.05. With these assump-
tions, the magnitude of magnetic ﬁelds is about 1
Gauss at Mr/M⊙ = 0.9998. Our model is a sim-
pliﬁed representation of the convective magnetic
ﬁeld. Our simple description does not respect
the stability and speciﬁc conﬁguration of magnetic
ﬁelds. Duez et al. (2009, 2010) studied the impact
of large-scale magnetic ﬁelds on the structure and
evolution of stars. They pointed out that a mixed
poloidal-toroidal conﬁguration is needed for the
ﬁelds to survive over evolution timescales.

We constructed the following ﬁve models: 1)
GS98M, a standard solar model constructed by us-
ing GS98 mixture opacities; 2) AGS1, a standard
model with AGS09 mixture opacities; 3) AGS2,
an enhanced diﬀusion model with AGS09 mixture
opacities; 4) AGSR, same as AGS2 but with ro-
tation (Pinsonneault et al. 1989; Yang & Bi 2007)
and convection overshoot; 5) AGSM, same as
AGSR but including the eﬀects of magnetic ﬁelds.
The initial rotation velocity Vinit of models is a
free parameter and is adjusted to obtain the sur-
face rotation velocity of about 2.0 km s−1 at the
age of 4.57 Gyr. The values of the parameters of
diﬀusion and convection overshoot are shown in
Table 1.

3. Calculation Results

3.1. Standard and enhanced diﬀusion mod-

els

The sound speed and density of our ad hoc

models are compared to those inferred in Basu et al.
(2009) using Birmingham Solar-Oscillations Net-
work (BiSON) (Chaplin et al. 1996) data. The
position of the CZ base, the surface helium abun-
dance and heavy-element abundance of the models
are listed in Table 1. Compared to the seismically
inferred CZ base radius (Basu & Antia 1997) and
helium abundance (Basu & Antia 2004), the po-
sition of the CZ base of AGS1 is too shallow and
its surface helium abundance is too low. Figures
1 and 2 show the relative diﬀerences between the
calculated and inferred sound speed and density
proﬁles. The relative sound-speed and density
diﬀerences of AGS1 are too large compared to
those of GS98M, as has been shown by many
authors (Serenelli et al. 2009; Serenelli & Basu
2010; Serenelli et al. 2011; Guzik et al. 2010;
Bi et al. 2011; Turck-Chi`eze et al. 2010, 2011;
Le Pennec et al. 2015).

In order to obtain the model that can restore
agreement with helioseismology, we constructed
the models with an enhanced diﬀusion rate, follow-
ing Basu & Antia (2004), Guzik et al. (2005), and
Yang & Bi (2007). However, we have no physical
justiﬁcation for these multipliers that are required
to restore agreement with helioseismology in our
calculations. Due to the eﬀect of the enhanced dif-
fusion, radial distributions of element abundances
of AGS2 are closer to those of GS98M in the ra-
diative region than those of AGS1 (see Figure
3). Thus the CZ base radius, the sound-speed
and density proﬁles of AGS2 are close to those of
GS98M. However, the surface helium abundance
of 0.223 is 6 σ away from the seismically inferred
value (Basu & Antia 2004).

3.2. Rotating model

Rotational and turbulent mixing can reduce
the surface helium settling (Proﬃtt & Michaud
1991; Yang & Bi 2006; Turck-Chi`eze et al. 2010;
Yang et al. 2013a,b). But the position of the CZ
base of rotating models with low Z is too shallow
(Yang & Bi 2007). Montalb´an et al. (2006) and
Castro et al. (2007) showed that convective over-

5

shoot can bring the depth of the CZ into agree-
ment with the seismic value. Therefore, in or-
der to resolve the low-helium problem and the
CZ depth problem, we constructed rotating solar
model AGSR with a convection overshoot that is
described by parameter δov. The convection over-
shoot brings the CZ base radius into agreement
with the seismic value. By full mixing the mate-
rial in the overshoot region with that in the con-
vective envelope, convection overshoot should lead
to an increase in the surface helium abundance.
The mass of overshoot region for δov = 0.1 or 0.2
is about 0.1% − 0.2% M⊙, but the mass of the
CZ is around 2.5% M⊙. Moreover, the gradient
of helium abundance at the base of the convec-
tive envelope, caused by microscopic diﬀusion and
element settling, has been partly ﬂattened by rota-
tional mixing. Thus the increase in helium abun-
dance caused by the overshooting is very small.
Compared with the eﬀect of rotational mixing, the
eﬀect of the overshooting on the surface helium
abundance is negligible. The convection overshoot
does not improve the surface helium abundance.

Due to the fact that rotational velocity is low,
centrifugal eﬀect is negligible in AGSR. The im-
pact of rotation on the solar model mainly de-
rives from the eﬀects of rotational mixing that rely
on hydrodynamical instabilities considered in the
model. The initial element abundances of AGSR
are almost the same as those of AGS2. Figure 3
shows that rotational mixing considered in AGSR
do not aﬀect clearly the distributions of element
abundances below 0.5 R⊙. Thus the models AGS2
and AGSR have almost the same central temper-
ature, density, element abundances (see Table 1),
and neutrino ﬂuxes (see Table 2). However, the
rotational mixing below the CZ base partly coun-
teracts the surface He and heavy-element settling.
Therefore, the He and heavy-element abundances
of AGSR are higher than those of AGS2 above
0.65 R⊙ but are lower than those of AGS2 between
about 0.5 and 0.65 R⊙. So the density of AGSR
is larger than that of AGS2 above 0.65 R⊙ but
is smaller than that of AGS2 between about 0.5
and 0.65 R⊙. As a consequence, the sound-speed
proﬁle of AGSR is signiﬁcantly changed between
about 0.5 and 0.7 R⊙.

Rotational mixing in AGSR reduces the amount
of surface He settling by about 29% and the
amount of surface heavy element settling by about

6

5%. Although the rate of element diﬀusion is
multiplied by a factor of 2 for helium abundance,
the surface helium abundance is reduced by only
about 14% below its initial value in AGSR.

The CZ base radius of 0.714 R⊙ of AGSR is
consistent with the seismically inferred value of
0.713 ± 0.001 R⊙ (Basu & Antia 1997). The abso-
lute values of relative sound-speed diﬀerence, δc/c,
and density diﬀerence, δρ/ρ, between AGSR and
the Sun are less than 0.0035 and 0.016, respec-
tively. These values are slightly less than those
of GS98M. The density proﬁle of AGSR is better
than that of GS98M. The surface helium abun-
dance of 0.23928 of AGSR is in agreement with
the seismically inferred value at the level of 2.6 σ.
However, Figures 4 shows that the frequen-
cies of low-degree p-modes of AGSR are not as
good as those of GS98M. Neutrino ﬂuxes calcu-
lated from AGSR disagree with those predicted
by Couvidat et al.
(2003), Turck-Chi`eze et al.
(2004), and Bahcall & Pinsonneault (2004).

3.3. Rotating model including the eﬀects

of magnetic ﬁelds

Turck-Chi`eze et al. (2010, 2011) suggested that
magnetic ﬁelds should be considered in solar mod-
els. The eﬀects of magnetic pressure, magnetic
energy, and the mixing of angular momentum and
chemical compositions caused by magnetic ﬁelds
are considered in AGSM.

Compared with the eﬀect of rotational and
magnetic mixing, the eﬀect of the overshooting
on the surface helium abundance is negligible in
AGSM. But the convection overshoot allows us
to recover the CZ base radius at the level of 1σ.
The surface He abundance is 0.2445, which agrees
with seismic value at the level of 1.1σ. The sur-
face Z/X ratio of this model is 0.0187. The mixing
caused by rotation and magnetic ﬁelds eﬃciently
reduces the surface He settling. Thus the He abun-
dance of AGSM is higher than that of AGSR above
0.63 R⊙ but is lower than that of AGSR below
0.63 R⊙. The mixing reduces the amount of sur-
face He settling by about 47% in AGSM, which
is slightly higher than 40% that was obtained by
Proﬃtt & Michaud (1991) using diﬀerent diﬀusion
coeﬃcient but does not exceed the upper limit of
50% assumed by Proﬃtt & Michaud (1991). The
surface He abundance is reduced by only 11%

(≈ 0.03 by mass fraction) below its initial value.
Although the rate of element diﬀusion is multi-
plied by a factor of 2 for helium abundance, the
11% reduction in the surface He abundance is con-
sistent with that of GS98M.

The relative sound-speed diﬀerence and density
diﬀerence between AGSM and the Sun, δc/c and
δρ/ρ, are less than 0.0058 and 0.019, respectively.
The density proﬁle of AGSM is as good as that of
GS98M (see Figure 2). The bump of sound-speed
proﬁle mainly appears between 0.63 and 0.71 R⊙.
Between 0.1 and 0.6 R⊙, the sound speed and den-
sity of this model match very well with those in-
ferred by Basu et al. (2009).

Figure 4 represents the diﬀerences between ob-

served frequencies of low-degree p-modes (Garc´ıa et al.
2011) and those calculated from diﬀerent models,
which shows that the agreement between the ob-
served and theoretical frequencies is improved by
the eﬀects of magnetic ﬁelds.

The initial rotation velocity of AGSR and
AGSM is 5.8 km s−1, which is consistent with
the conclusion that solar rotation velocity is in
the range of 5 − 10 km s−1 at zero-age main se-
quence (Turck-Chi`eze et al. 2010). The surface
velocity of both AGSR and AGSM is about 2
km s−1. Eﬃcient transport of angular momen-
tum ﬂattens the angular velocity proﬁle of AGSM
between about 0.3 and 0.7 R⊙ (see Figure 5),
which is consistent with seismically inferred re-
sult (Chaplin et al. 1999a) and is compatible with
the ﬁrst observation of gravity modes (see ﬁg-
ures 2 and 4 of Garc´ıa et al. (2007) or ﬁgure
8 of Turck-Chi`eze et al. (2010)). The central
angular velocity is 5 times as large as the sur-
face angular velocity. The total angular momen-
tum of AGSM is 2.40 × 1048 g cm2 s−1 that is
closer to 1.94 ± 0.05 × 1048 g cm2 s−1 inferred by
Komm et al. (2003) than 3.85 × 1048 g cm2 s−1 of
AGSR.

The magnetic energy is mainly stored in the
radiative region (see Figure 5). Couvidat et al.
(2003) showed that an internal large-scale mag-
netic ﬁeld cannot exceed a maximum strength of
about 3 × 107 G in the radiative region. The
strength of magnetic ﬁeld of AGSM is less than
about 3 × 104 G in the radiative region but is less
than around 3 × 103 G in the CZ.

Furthermore, Figures 6 and 7 show the distri-

7

butions of ratios of small to large separations, r02
and r13, of these models as a function of frequency.
The ratios are essentially independent of the struc-
ture of outer layer and are only determined by the
interior structure of stars (Roxburgh & Vorontsov
2003). The distributions of the ratios of AGS1 dis-
agree with those calculated from the observed fre-
quencies of Chaplin et al. (1999b) or Garc´ıa et al.
(2011). This indicates that interior structures
of AGS1 do not match those of the Sun. Al-
though the GS98M model performs much better
than other models, the observed ratios are almost
reproduced by AGSR and AGSM.

3.4. Prediction of neutrino ﬂuxes

Neutrino ﬂuxes can provide a strict constraint
on the core of the Sun, which is independent on
helioseismology (Turck-Chi`eze & Couvidat 2011).
Table 2 lists detected and predicted solar neu-
trino ﬂuxes.
The BP04 and SSeM are the
best model of Bahcall & Pinsonneault (2004),
Couvidat et al. (2003) and Turck-Chi`eze et al.
(2011), respectively. These models not only
are in agreement with helioseismic results, but
can reproduce the measured neutrino ﬂuxes
(Bahcall & Pinsonneault 2004; Turck-Chi`eze et al.
2001, 2004, 2010, 2011; Couvidat et al. 2003;
Turck-Chi`eze & Couvidat 2011). We compare
neutrino ﬂuxes computed from our models with
those predicted by BP04 and SSeM.

The neutrino ﬂuxes calculated from GS98M
are in good agreement with those predicted by
Bahcall et al. (2001) except 7Be neutrino ﬂux.
The 7Be neutrino ﬂux computed from GS98M
is also larger than those predicted by BP04 and
SSeM. The neutrino ﬂuxes calculated from AGS1,
AGS2, and AGSR are obviously diﬀerent from
those predicted by GS98M, BP04, and SSeM.
However, the ﬂuxes of pp, pep, 8B, 13N, and 15O
neutrinos of AGSM are almost in agreement with
those of BP04 (Bahcall & Pinsonneault 2004)
and SSeM (Turck-Chi`eze et al. 2001, 2004, 2011;
Couvidat et al. 2003; Turck-Chi`eze & Couvidat
2011). The 17F neutrino ﬂux of AGSM is also in
agreement with that of BP04 but is higher than
that of SSeM. The relative diﬀerence between the
neutrino ﬂuxes of AGSM and those of BP04 is less
than 2.0%.

The hep neutrino ﬂux of AGSM is consistent
with those of GS98M but is higher than that of

BP04. The discrepancy between hep neutrino ﬂux
of AGSM and that of BP04 can be attributed
to the nuclear cross section factor S0(hep) which
only aﬀects the ﬂux of hep neutrinos and does
not aﬀect the calculated ﬂuxes of other neutri-
nos (Bahcall et al. 2001). Comparing the neutrino
ﬂuxes calculated from AGS1, AGS2, AGSR, and
AGSM with those predicted by BP04 and SSeM
and the detected neutrino ﬂuxes, one can ﬁnd that
the neutrino-ﬂux agreement is considerably im-
proved by the eﬀects of magnetic ﬁelds and that
AGSM is obviously better than pure SSM low-Z
models.

4. Discussion and Summary

The equatorial velocity of about 2 km s−1, i.e.
2.94×10−6 rad s−1, is taken as the surface velocity
of models at the age of the Sun. This value is
slightly higher than 2.72 × 10−6 rad s−1 adopted
by Komm et al. (2003). Thus the total angular
momentum of AGSM is slightly larger than that
inferred by Komm et al. (2003). The low angular
velocity can be achieved by a slow initial rotation.
The sound speed proﬁle is practically unchanged
when a slower initial rotation is adopted, which
is consistent with the result of Turck-Chi`eze et al.
(2010).

The rates of element diﬀusion are enhanced
by multipling a factor of 2 to the diﬀusion ve-
locity of He and a factor of 2.5 to the diﬀusion
velocity of heavy elements. The eﬀect of mix-
ing caused by rotation and magnetic ﬁelds re-
duces the amount of surface He settling by about
47%. So the surface He abundance is reduced
by only 11% below its initial value. A roughly
10% reduction in the surface He abundance has
been proved by many best solar models. Solar ac-
tivity and helioseismology show the limitation of
SSM and call for the dynamical solar model in-
cluding dynamical processes (Turck-Chi`eze et al.
2010; Turck-Chi`eze & Couvidat 2011).
In order
to keep a roughly 10% reduction in the surface He
abundance, the rates of element diﬀusion must be
enhanced in our dynamical solar models.

The SSM with AGS09 mixtures does not agree
with seismic constraints for sound-speed and den-
sity proﬁles, CZ base radius, and CZ helium abun-
dance. Thus we calculated the dynamical solar
models that include the eﬀects of enhanced dif-

fusion, rotation, convection overshoot, and mag-
netic ﬁelds. The discrepancies between models
with AGS09 mixtures and helioseismic results can
be signiﬁcantly reduced by the enhanced diﬀusion.
However, the surface helium abundance of the en-
hanced diﬀusion model is too low. The surface
He settling can be partially counteracted by rota-
tional mixing. Thus the low-helium problem can
be resolved by the eﬀect of rotation to a great
extent. Convection overshoot aids in resolving
the problem of shallow CZ base position but does
not aﬀect clearly the surface helium abundance.
Thus the CZ base radius of models with convec-
tion overshoot are consistent with the seismically
inferred value. This reﬂects that rotation and con-
vection overshoot may be important in the evo-
lution of the Sun. Moreover, rotation plays an
important role in the formation of the extended
main-sequence turnoﬀ of intermediate-age massive
star clusters (Yang et al. 2013a,b); and convec-
tion overshoot plays an essential role in explaining
some of characteristics of solar-like oscillations of
stars (Yang et al. 2015). These indicate that the
eﬀects of rotation and convection overshoot should
not be ignored in the evolutions of stars.

Although the rotating AGSR model can re-
produce the seismically inferred sound-speed
and density proﬁles and the CZ base radius,
the neutrino ﬂuxes calculated from this model
are not in agreement with those predicted by
BP04 (Bahcall & Pinsonneault 2004) and SSeM
(Couvidat et al. 2003; Turck-Chi`eze et al. 2004;
Turck-Chi`eze & Couvidat 2011). Moreover, the
total angular momentum of 3.85 × 1048 g cm2 s−1
of AGSR is too high. Turck-Chi`eze et al. (2011)
suggested that the eﬀects of magnetic ﬁeld must
be considered during the solar life. We consider
the eﬀects of magnetic pressure, magnetic energy,
and magnetic mixing. The surface He abundance
and neutrino ﬂuxes are signiﬁcantly improved by
the eﬀects of magnetic ﬁeld.

In this work, we constructed dynamical solar
models with the AGS09 mixtures in which the ef-
fects of enhanced diﬀusion, rotation, convection
overshoot, and magnetic ﬁelds were included. We
obtained two models: AGSR and AGSM that
almost restore agreement with helioseismology.
Compared to GS98 SSM, AGSR can reproduce
the CZ base radius, the sound-speed and density
proﬁles. The surface helium abundance of about

8

0.2393 of this model is 2.6 σ away from the seismi-
cally inferred value of Basu & Antia (2004). The
position of the CZ base of AGSM agrees with
the seismically inferred value at the level of 1
σ. The surface helium abundance of 0.2445 of
AGSM agrees with the seismic value at the level
of 1.1σ. The density proﬁle of this model is as
good as that of GS98M. The sound-speed pro-
ﬁle of AGSM matches very well that inferred in
Basu et al. (2009) between 0.1 and 0.6 R⊙. The
bump of the sound speed mainly appears between
0.63 and 0.71 R⊙. The relative diﬀerence of the
sound speed between AGSM and the Sun, δc/c, is
less than 0.0058 in the tacholine. Moreover, the
observed separation ratios r02 and r13 are almost
reproduced by AGSM; the initial helium abun-
dance of AGSM is in agreement with 0.273 ± 0.006
given by Serenelli & Basu (2010) at the level of 1
σ.

The 8B neutrino ﬂux predicted by AGSM
agrees with the detected one and the prediction
of SSeM at the level of about 1σ. The ﬂuxes of
pp, pep, and 7Be neutrinos computed from AGSM
are not far from the detected ones and the pre-
dictions of BP04 and SSeM. The improvement
in the sound-speed and density proﬁles and the
CZ radius mainly derives from the eﬀects of the
enhanced diﬀusion and overshooting which are
dependent of the dynamical processes, while the
improvement in the surface helium abundance and
neutrino ﬂuxes basically comes from the eﬀects of
the dynamical processes. Although the GS98 SSM
performs much better than the low-Z models as a
whole, the agreement between the low-Z models
and seismic and neutrino results is improved by
the eﬀects of the dynamical processes.

aThe multiplier for the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of the helium;
bThe multiplier for the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of the heavy elements;
cUsing OPAL EOS96, Bahcall et al. (2004) obtained Rcz = 0.7155 R⊙.

Table 2: Predicted solar neutrino ﬂuxes from models. The table shows the predicted ﬂuxes, in units of
1010(pp), 109(7Be), 108(pep,13 N,15 O), 106(8B,17 F), and 103(hep) cm2s−1. The BP04 is the best model
of Bahcall & Pinsonneault (2004) and has the GS98 mixtures. The SSeM is the best standard model
that reproduces the seismic sound speed (Couvidat et al. 2003; Turck-Chi`eze & Couvidat 2011). The old
SSeM has high-metal abundances (Couvidat et al. 2003), but the new SSeM has the low-metal abundances
(Turck-Chi`eze et al. 2004; Turck-Chi`eze & Couvidat 2011).
