Abstract

A nonplanar graph G is called almost-planar if for every edge e of G, at least one of G\e and
G/e is planar. In 1990, Gubser characterized 3-connected almost-planar graphs in his dissertation.
However, his proof is so long that only a small portion of it was published. The main purpose of
this paper is to provide a short proof of this result. We also discuss the structure of almost-planar
graphs that are not 3-connected.

Introduction

A nonplanar graph G is called almost-planar if for every edge e of G, at least one of G\e and G/e is
planar. The following is an equivalent deﬁnition. For any speciﬁed set S of graphs, let us call a graph
S-free if it does not contain any graph in S as a minor. Using this terminology, we can say that a
graph G is almost-planar if and only if G is not {K5, K3,3}-free but for every edge e of G, at least one
of G\e and G/e is {K5, K3,3}-free.

The second deﬁnition is a special case of a concept in matroid theory. Let S be a speciﬁed set
of matroids. Let S-free matroids be deﬁned analogous to S-free graphs. Then a matroid M is called
S-fragile if M is not S-free but for every element e of M , at least one of M \e and M/e is S-free.
In recent years, fragility has received a lot of attention due to its connection with representability.
There are characterizations of S-fragile matroids for several choices of S. Among these, the ﬁrst is
a characterization of {K5, K3,3}-fragile 3-connected graphic matroids. This result was obtained by
Gubser in his dissertation [2], which was done before the term “S-fragile” was introduced.
In the
following discussion, we will use the term “almost-planar graph” instead of “{K5, K3,3}-fragile graph”.
To state the characterization of Gubser we need a few deﬁnitions. Let n ≥ 3 be an integer. A
wheel of size n, denoted by Wn, is the graph obtained from a cycle of length n by adding a vertex and
joining it to all vertices of the cycle. A double wheel of size n, denoted by DWn, is the graph obtained
from a cycle of length n by adding two adjacent vertices and joining them to all vertices of the cycle.
A M¨obius ladder of length n, denoted by Mn, is obtained from a cycle of length 2n by joining opposite
pairs of vertices on the cycle. Finally, let W denote the set of all graphs constructed by identifying
three triangles from three wheels. In other words, each graph G ∈ W admits a partition (V0, V1, V2, V3)
of its vertex set such that G[V0] is a triangle, G[V0 ∪ Vi] is a wheel (i = 1, 2, 3), and G has no edges
other than those in these three wheels.

Theorem 1.1 (Gubser [2]). Let G be a 3-connected nonplanar graph. Then the following are equivalent.

(i) G is almost-planar;
(ii) G is a minor of a double wheel, a M¨obius ladder, or a graph in W;
(iii) G is F-free, where F = {EX1, EX2, EX3, EX6, EX8} shown in Figure 1.1.

Figure 1.1: Forbidden graphs EX1, EX2, EX3, EX6, and EX8

We remark that terminology EX1, EX2, . . . , EX8 is inherited from [2]. We also remark that our
formulation of this theorem is slightly diﬀerent from that given in [2]. First, we modiﬁed the deﬁnition
of graphs in W. We make the change because our description better reveals the structure of these
graphs. Second, set F given in [2] consists of eight graphs, instead of ﬁve graphs. These eight include
the ﬁve listed in Figure 1.1 and another three graphs, which were denoted by EX4, EX5, and EX7.
Since each of these three extra graphs contains EX8 as a minor, they are removed from our statement.
By Seymour’s Splitter Theorem [5], every almost-planar graph can be generated from K5 and K3,3
by repeatedly adding edges and splitting vertices, although not every graph constructed this way has
to be almost-planar. Therefore, to prove that every almost-planar graph must be one of the three types
listed in (ii), one only needs to show that any extension of any graph of the three types either results
in another graph of the three types or contains a member of F as a minor. This is how the proof went
in [2]. The author divided the analysis into ﬁfteen cases, depending on which graph is extended and
how the graph is extended. Since the case checking is lengthy, the published proof [1] includes only
two of the ﬁfteen cases.

The main purpose of this paper is to provide a short proof of Theorem 1.1. At the end of the paper,
we will also discuss the structure of almost-planar graphs that are not 3-connected. This discussion
corrects a few ﬂaws appearing in [1].

We close this section by making two more remarks. Notice that graphs in W can be naturally
divided into three groups, depending on how the three hubs are distributed on the common triangle.
When none of the hubs are identiﬁed, the resulting graph is in fact a minor of a M¨obius ladder, as
illustrated in Figure 1.2. What this means is that we could deﬁne W diﬀerently so that these graphs
are not included in W. We choose to leave them in W since it makes the deﬁnition more clean. This
is another diﬀerence between our formulation of Theorem 1.1 and the formulation given in [2].

Next, for each G ∈ {K5, K3,3}, let G+ be obtained from G by adding a new vertex v and a new
edge e between v and G. Then G+ is not almost-planar since both G+\e and G+/e are nonplanar.
Notice that EX2 contains K +
3,3. Hence EX1, EX2, and EX8 are
not minimally non-almost-planar nonplanar graphs. However, by Theorem 1.1, within the universe
of 3-connected graphs, these three graphs are minimal and in fact, members of F are precisely the
only ﬁve minimal graphs. In the last section of this paper, we determine all minimal graphs without

5 , while EX1 and EX8 contain K +

2 A few lemmas

In this section we present a few lemmas that will be used in our main proof. Let k ≥ 0 be an integer.
A k-separation of a graph G is an unordered pair {G1, G2} of proper induced subgraphs of G such that
G1 ∪ G2 = G and |G1 ∩ G2| = k. The following is an immediate corollary of (2.4) of [4].

Lemma 2.1. Let x be a cubic vertex of a nonplanar graph G. Suppose G has no k-separation {G1, G2}
with k ≤ 2 and such that some Gi contains x and all its three neighbors. Then G has a subgraph G′
such that G′ is a subdivision of K3,3 and x is cubic in G′.

A 3-connected graph G with |G| ≥ 5 is called internally 4-connected if for every 3-separation
{G1, G2} of G, exactly one of G1, G2 is K1,3. Notice that no cubic vertex belongs to a triangle in an
internally 4-connected graph. We will use this property repeatedly. Let C 2
n be the graph obtained from
a cycle of length n by joining all pairs of vertices of distance two on the cycle.

Lemma 2.2. Let G be an internally 4-connected nonplanar minor of a M¨obius ladder. Then G = Mn
or C 2

2n−1 for some integer n ≥ 3.

Proof. Let k ≥ 3 be the smallest integer such that G is a minor of Mk. Let Mk consist of a Hamilton
cycle C and pairwise crossing chords. The minimality of k implies that no chord is deleted in obtaining
G. Moreover, since G is nonplanar, no chord is contracted and no edge of C is deleted. So G is obtained
by contracting some edges of C. Since no cubic vertex of G belongs to a triangle, it follows that either
G = Mk or k ≥ 5 is odd and G = C 2
k .

We remark that the lemma holds even if we drop the nonplanarity assumption.
The next is a theorem of Maharry and Robertson [3] on M4-free graphs. An alternating double
wheel of length 2n (n ≥ 2), denoted by AW2n, is obtained from a cycle v1v2...v2nv1 by adding two new
adjacent vertices u1, u2 such that ui is adjacent to v2j+i for all i = 1, 2 and j = 0, 1, ..., n − 1.

Lemma 2.3 (Maharry and Robertson [3]). If an internally 4-connected graph G is M4-free then at
least one of the following holds.

(i) G is planar;
(ii) |G| ≥ 8 and G\{v1, v2, v3, v4} is edgeless, for some distinct v1, v2, v3, v4 ∈ V (G);

3

(iii) G = DWn+3 or AW2n for some n ≥ 3;
(iv) G is the line graph of K3,3;
(v) G has fewer than eight vertices.

For any two vertices x, y of a path P , let P [x, y] denote the subpath of P between x, y. Let H be
a graph. If G is a subdivision of H, then branch vertices of G are vertices of G that correspond to
vertices of H, and arcs of G are paths of G that correspond to edges of H. A triad addition of H is
obtained by adding a new vertex v to H and joining v to three distinct vertices of H.

Lemma 2.4. Let H be a simple graph with |H| ≥ 3. If a 3-connected graph G has a subgraph G′ such
that G′ is a subdivision of H and |G′| < |G|, then G contains a triad addition of H as a minor.

Proof. Let v ∈ V (G) \ V (G′) and let P1, P2, P3 be three paths of G from v to G′ such that they are
disjoint except for v. Let vi (i = 1, 2, 3) be the other end of Pi. We ﬁrst prove that G′, P1, P2, P3 can
be chosen so that v1, v2, v3 are not contained in a single arc of G′.

Suppose G′ has an arc A containing v1, v2, v3. Let x, y be the two ends of A and let x, v1, v2, v3, y
be the order that they appear in A. Suppose G′, P1, P2, P3 are chosen such that |A[x, v1] ∪ A[y, v3]| is
minimized. Since G is 3-connected, G\{v1, v3} has a path Q from (P1 ∪ P2 ∪ P3 ∪ A[v1, v3])\{v1, v3} to
G′\V (A[v1, v3]). By the minimality of |A[x, v1] ∪ A[y, v3]|, the other end of Q must belong to G′\V (A).
It follows that G′ ∪ P1 ∪ P2 ∪ P3 ∪ Q contains a subdivision of H and three required paths.

Now we assume that v1, v2, v3 are not contained in a single arc. It is easy to see that this property

can be preserved when we contract G′ to H. At the end we obtain a triad addition of H as a minor.

3 A proof of Theorem 1.1

Before proving Theorem 1.1 we establish three lemmas, which are the main parts of our proof. Let
{G1, G2} be a 3-separation of G. For i = 1, 2, let G∆
i be obtained from Gi by adding all missing edges
between vertices of G1 ∩ G2; let GY
i be obtained from Gi by adding a new vertex vi and joining vi to
all three vertices of G1 ∩ G2.

In the rest of this paper, we use K h

5 to refer to the graph EX6
since these names better reﬂect the fact that EX3 and EX6 are formed from K3,3 and K5, respectively,
by adding a handle edge.

1 . Since G is 3-connected and GY

Proof. Let V (G1) ∩ V (G2) = {v1, v2, v3} and let x be the cubic vertex added to G1 in the formation of
GY
1 contains a subdivision of K3,3
such that x is cubic in the subdivision. It follows that any cycle of G2 disjoint from {v1, v2, v3} results
in a K h

3,3 minor in G. Thus T = G2\{v1, v2, v3} is a forest.

1 is nonplanar, by Lemma 2.1, GY

Let u ∈ V (T ). Since G is 3-connected, G2 contains three induced paths P1, P2, P3 from u to each
of v1, v2, v3, respectively, such that the three paths are disjoint except for u. If G2 has a vertex outside
P1 ∪ P2 ∪ P3, then G has a K +
3,3 minor. So T = (P1\v1) ∪ (P2\v2) ∪ (P3\v3). If P1, P2, P3 are all single
edges, then G∆

2 is a wheel W3. Otherwise, suppose without loss of generality that |P1| ≥ 3.

4

Let w be any internal vertex of P1. Since P1 is an induced path and G is 3-connected, w must be
adjacent to some vertices outside P1. Since T is a tree, the only possible neighbors of w outside P1 are
v2 and v3. If w is adjacent to both v2, v3 then G has a K +
3,3 minor. So w is adjacent to exactly one of
v2, v3. If w, w′ are distinct internal vertices of P1 such that both wv2 and w′v3 are edges of G, then
G again has a K +
3,3 minor. Therefore, all internal vertices of P1 are cubic and they have a common
neighbor outside P1, which we may assume to be v2.

Since G is K +

3,3-free, we deduce that |P2| = 2 and no internal vertex of P3 is adjacent to v1. So all
vertices of P3\v3 are cubic and adjacent to v2. Therefore, G2 consists of path P1 ∪ P3, all edges from
v2 to (P1\v1) ∪ (P3\v3), and possibly edges between v1, v2, v3, which implies that G∆

2 is a wheel.

Lemma 3.2. Let G be connected and {K +
of Mn for some n ≥ 4.

3,3, K h

5 }-free. If G contains an M4-minor then G is a minor

Proof. Since M4 is cubic, it is a topological minor of G, so G has a subgraph H isomorphic to a
subdivision of M4. Since G is K +
3,3-free, H must be a spanning subgraph and no chord of M4 is
subdivided. It follows that the rim of H is a Hamilton cycle C of G. Let v0, ..., v7 be the eight cubic
vertices of H, listed in the order they appear on C. We denote the path of C from vi to vi+1 by Ai,
where i = 0, ..., 7. (In this proof the indices are taken modulo 8.)

Let e be any chord of C. We prove that there exists i such that the two ends of e belong to Ai and
Ai+4, respectively. We ﬁrst observe that no Ai contains both ends of e because then H + e contains a
K +
3,3 minor. Next, assume one end of e is an internal vertex of some Ai. If the other end of e does not
belong to Ai+4, it is straightforward to verify that H + e can be contracted to M4 + vjvj+2, for some
j, and thus G contains a K +
3,3 minor. So both ends of e are cubic vertices of H, implying e = vivi+t
(t = 3, 4, 5), which satisﬁes the requirement.

To ﬁnish the proof, we only need to show that any two non-adjacent chords e, f must cross. By
what we proved in the last paragraph, this is clear if the four ends of e, f are not contained in Ai ∪ Ai+4
for any i. If all ends of e, f are contained in Ai ∪ Ai+4 for some i and if e, f do not cross each other,
then H + e + f can be contracted to M4 + vivi+5 + vi+1vi+4, which contains a K h
5 minor. Therefore,
e, f must cross and that completes our proof.

Proof. If G has an M4-minor then the result follows immediately from lemmas 3.2 and 2.2. So we
assume that G is M4-free. Since G is nonplanar, one of (ii)-(v) of Lemma 2.3 must hold. If (iii) holds
then we are done. Case (iv) does not hold since L(K3,3) contains a K h
3,3 minor, as shown in Figure 3.1.

Figure 3.1: K h

3,3 is a minor of L(K3,3), and K +

3,3 is a minor of Cube+v

5

Suppose (ii) holds. Let V (G)\{v1, v2, v3, v4} = {u1, ..., vk}. Note that each ui has degree either 3
or 4. If two or more of them are of degree 4 then K +
3,3 is a minor of G. If every ui is cubic, since no
two of them have the same set of neighbors, it follows that k = 4 and G is the cube, which does not
happen since G is nonplanar. So we assume that u1 has degree 4, while every other ui is cubic. As a
result, k = 4 or 5. If k = 4 then G is AW6. If k = 5 then G\u1 is the cube and so G has a K +
3,3 minor,
as shown in Figure 3.1.

It remains to consider case (v). If |G| ≤ 5, since G is nonplanar, we have G ∼= K5 = DW3. If
|G| = 6, then G contains a K3,3 subgraph, as every 3-connected nonplanar graph with more than ﬁve
vertices contains a K3,3 minor. Since no cubic vertex of G belongs to a triangle, it follows that either
G = K3,3 = M3, or G contains at least two edges from each color class of K3,3. If G contains no other
edges then G = DW4; if G contains at least one other edge then G contains K +
5 .

If |G| = 7, we may assume that G contains a subgraph obtained from K3,3 by subdividing an edge
exactly once. Let {b1, b2, b3} and {r1, r2, r3} be the two color classes of K3,3 and let v be the vertex
subdividing edge b1r1. Since v is not a cubic vertex that belongs to a triangle, we deduce that v has
degree at least 4. If v is adjacent to both b2, b3 or both r2, r3, then G contains K +
3,3. So the degree of
v is 4, and we may assume that v is adjacent to b2 and r2. Let H be the subgraph of G obtained from
the subdivision of K3,3 by adding edges vb2 and vr2. Now b1 and r1 are in triangles, so they must have
degree at least 4 in G. If G contains the edge b1r1, then G contains K +
3,3. So b1 must be adjacent to b2
or b3, and r1 must be adjacent to r2 or r3. It follows that b3 and r3 are in triangles and thus they must
also have degree at least 4 in G. Notice that H + b1b3 + r1r2 ∼= H + b1b3 + r2r3, which contains K h
5 .
So G is obtained from H either by adding edges b1b3 and r1r3, which leads to G = C 2
7 , or by adding
paths b1b2b3 and r1r2r3, which leads to G = DW5.

Now we are ready to prove Theorem 1.1.

Proof of Theorem 1.1. We prove implications

(ii) ⇒ (i) ⇒ (iii) ⇒ (iv) ⇒ (ii), where (iv) is the

3,3}-free.

(iv) G is {K +
(ii) ⇒ (i): Note that, if P is the class of all planar and almost-planar graphs, then P is closed
under taking minors. Therefore, we only need to verify that each M¨obius ladder, each double wheel,
and each graph in W is almost-planar. In Mn, deleting a rim edge or contracting a chord results in a
planar graph, so Mn is almost-planar. In DWn, deleting the axle or a rim edge or contracting a spoke
results in a planar graph, so DWn is almost-planar. In any G ∈ W, contracting a spoke or an edge in
the common triangle or deleting a rim edge results in a planar graph, so G is almost planar.

(i) ⇒ (iii): Since P is closed under taking minors, we only need to show that each H ∈ F is not in
P. To do this, we only need to ﬁnd an edge e such that both H\e and H/e are nonplanar. In EX1
every edge satisﬁes the requirement. In EX2 and EX8, any edge incident with the top cubic vertex
(of the drawing shown in Figure 1.1) has the required property.
5 (EX3 and EX5,
respectively), the handle edge meets the requirement.

3,3 and K h

In K h

(iii) ⇒ (iv): Since {K h

otherwise. Then G has a vertex v such that G\v is nonplanar, which implies that G has a subgraph G′
such that |G′| < |G| and G′ is a subdivision of K5 or K3,3. By Lemma 2.4, G contains a triad addition

3,3} ⊆ F, we only need to show that G is {K +

of K5 or K3,3 as a minor. However, EX2 is the only triad addition of K5, and EX1, EX8 are the only
triad additions of K3,3. Thus (iii) is violated no matter what is the outcome, which proves (iv).

(iv) ⇒ (ii): Assume G is {K +

3,3}-free. We will show G is a minor of a double wheel, a
M¨obius ladder, or a graph in W. Recall that a 3-sum of two graphs G1, G2 is obtained by identifying
a triangle of G1 with a triangle of G2, and then deleting 0, 1, 2, or 3 of the three identiﬁed edges.

5 , K h

If G has three vertices whose deletion results in more than two components, since G is K +

3,3-free,
there should be exactly three components and thus G can be expressed as a 3-sum of three graphs
G1, G2, G3 over a common triangle. For each i = 1, 2, 3, by applying Lemma 3.1 to the 3-separation
of G determined by {Gj ∪ Gk, Gi}, where {i, j, k} = {1, 2, 3}, we conclude that Gi is a wheel, which
implies that G ∈ W. In the rest of this proof we assume that any three vertices separate G into at
most two components, and we call such a graph strongly connected.

1 and GY

1 is also strongly connected, because any bad 3-cut of G∆

We claim that G has an internally 4-connected nonplanar minor G′ such that G is obtained by
3-summing wheels to distinct triangles of G′. Suppose the claim is false. We consider a counterexample
G with |G| as small as possible. Since internally 4-connected graphs are not counterexamples, G must
have a 3-separation {G1, G2} such that neither part is K1,3. Since G is nonplanar, at least one of
GY
2 is nonplanar. Without loss of generality, suppose GY
1 is nonplanar. Let us choose such a
3-separation with G1 as small as possible. Since G2 6= K1,3, G∆
1 is a 3-connected minor of G. Notice
that G∆
1 would lead to a bad 3-cut of G.
Moreover, G∆
1 is nonplanar, the common triangle xyz of
G∆
1 , which implies that G\{x, y, z} has more than two
components, contradicting the strong connectivity of G. Therefore, G∆
1 satisﬁes all the assumptions
of our claim and thus it is not a counterexample, as it is smaller than G. So G∆
1 is obtained from an
internally 4-connected nonplanar minor G′ by 3-summing wheels to diﬀerent triangles of G′. By the
minimality of G1, triangle xyz must be contained in G′ and thus G is not a counterexample because
G is also obtained from G′ by 3-summing wheels to distinct triangles of G′, since G∆
2 is a wheel by
Lemma 3.1. This contradiction proves our claim.

1 is nonplanar, because otherwise, since GY

2 would not be a facial triangle of G∆

1 and G∆

By Lemma 3.3, we know G′ = Mn or C 2

2n+1
is a minor of M2n+1 and AW2n is a minor of DW2n so the theorem holds if G = G′. Next, suppose
at least one wheel is added to G′. Since Mn and AW2n do not have any triangles, we only need to
consider all possible ways to add wheels to triangles of C 2

2n+1 or DWn or AW2n for some n ≥ 3. Note that C 2

2n+1 and DWn.

Suppose G′ = C 2

2n+1 (n ≥ 3). Observe that the 3-sum of G′ and a wheel is a graph with an M4

minor. By Lemma 3.2, G is a minor of a M¨obius ladder and thus the theorem holds.

Suppose G′ = DWn (n ≥ 4) is obtained by adding two adjacent vertices u1 and u2 to a cycle
C = v0v1...vn−1vn and joining each of u1, u2 to all vi (indices are taken modulo n in this paragraph).
Let H be a 3-sum of G′ and a wheel Wk over a triangle T . If T is u1u2vi then H contains a K +
3,3
minor since H\{vi+2, vi+3, ..., vi−2} contains a K3,3 minor. There is only one other type of triangle in
G′, so suppose T is u1v1v2. If v1v2 is an edge of H then H contains a K h
5 minor, which can be seen
by considering the graph formed by cycle C, cycle v0u1v3u2v0, edges u1u2, u2v1, and three paths from
Wk\V (T ) to T . The same conﬁguration also shows that if k ≥ 4 then the hub of Wk is not identiﬁed
with v1 or v2. So the eﬀect of 3-summing Wk to G′ is to subdivide an edge vivi+1 and to join all the
subdividing vertices with some uj. Many wheels can be added to DWn in the same fashion. Thus

3-summing wheels to DWn either creates a K +

Finally, let G′ = K5 (note K5 ∼= C 2

5 minor or results in a minor of a double wheel.
∼= DW3). We assume that G is M4-free because otherwise the
theorem holds by Lemma 3.2. Let T be the set of summing triangles, which are triangles of G′ over
which a wheel is 3-summed to G′ in obtaining G. To ﬁnish oﬀ this last case we ﬁrst determine T and
then determine how wheels are 3-summed to each member of T .

Let V (G′) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and let T1 = {123, 124, 134} and T2 = {123, 234, 145}. We claim that,
up to a permutation, either T = T1 or T ⊆ T2. First we observe that turning triangles 123, 124, 125
into triads in G′ results in K h
3,3, and turning 123, 134, 145 into triads results in M4. Therefore, {123,
124, 125} and {123, 134, 145} are not subsets of T because otherwise G contains K h
3,3 or M4 as a
minor. Similarly {123, 124, 134, 234} 6⊆ T because otherwise G contains a K +
3,3 minor (deleting any of
the triads still leaves a nonplanar graph). Now it is straightforward to verify that either some vertex
i belongs to at least three summing triangles, in which case T = T1 (up to a permutation), or every
vertex i belongs to at most two summing triangles, in which case T ⊆ T2 (up to a permutation), and
thus the claim is proved.

Suppose a wheel Wk is 3-summed to G′ over xyz ∈ T . If k = 3 then at least one of the three
5 minor. If k > 3 and if the hub of Wk is

We call x a hub of xyz if either k > 3 and the hub of Wk is identiﬁed with x, or k = 3 and x meets
all edges of G between x, y, z. The above observations imply that every summing triangle has a hub,
and if x is a hub then yz 6∈ E(G). In the following we make two observations. Let xyz ∈ T .

(a) If yzw ∈ T then either y or z is a hub of xyz, where we assume w 6= x.
(b) If xuv ∈ T then either y or z is a hub of xyz, where we assume {y, z} ∩ {u, v} = ∅.

To prove these two statements we assume that neither y nor z is a hub of xyz. Then either k > 3 and
the hub of Wk is identiﬁed with x, or k = 3 and both xy, xz are edges of G. In both cases (a) and (b),
if k = 3 then G contains a K +
3,3 minor
(Figure 3.2(iv-v)). These contradictions prove both (a) and (b).

Suppose T = T1. Then none of the edges 23, 24, 34 are in G, because otherwise G contains a K +
3,3
minor. This observation and (a) imply that 1 is a hub for all three summing triangles. As a result,
G\{1, 5} is a cycle and thus G is a minor of some DWn.

Suppose T ⊆ T2. We assume without loss of generality that T = T2. We ﬁrst note that 14 is not
an edge of G because otherwise G contains a K h
3,3 minor. This observation and (a) and (b) imply that
5 is a hub of 145, and hubs of 123, 234 are in {2, 3}. If 2 (or 3) is a hub for both 123 and 234, then G
is a minor of some DWn (Figure 3.3(i)); if 2 is a hub of 123 and 3 is a hub of 234, then G is a minor
of a M¨obius ladder (Figure 3.3(ii)). Now the proof of Theorem 1.1 is complete.

4 Graphs of low connectivity

In the published version [1] of [2], graphs of low connectivity are also considered. Some of the statements
in [1] are not accurate. Its second main theorem (Theorem 2.2) states: A graph is neither planar nor
almost-planar if and only if it has a {EXi : 1 ≤ i ≤ 8}-minor. As we pointed out in the introduction,
K +
3,3 is a counterexample to this statement. In this section we prove a corrected version of this theorem.
For any graph G, let G ⊕ e be obtained from G by adding two adjacent new vertices, and let G∗
be obtained from G by deleting all its isolated vertices (assuming that E(G) 6= ∅). Let D(G) be the
set of edges e of G such that G\e is planar.

Theorem 4.1. The following are equivalent for any nonplanar graph G.

(i) G is almost-planar;
(ii) G∗ is obtained from a 3-connected almost-planar H by subdividing edges in D(H);
(iii) G is F ′-free, where F ′ = {K +

3,3, K5 ⊕ e, K3,3 ⊕ e}.

One possible sharpening of (ii) is to describe D(H) explicitly. If H is a M¨obius ladder or a double
wheel or a graph in W, then it is easy to determine D(H). For each nonplanar minor H ′ of H, one could
also describe D(H ′) because the structure of H is simple enough. However, we choose not to include
it in the paper since such a description is tedious and its derivation is straightforward. Statement (ii)
is also touched in [1], but the treatment is not rigorous.

Two corollaries of Theorem 2.1 characterize those almost-planar graphs that are not 3-connected.
The elementary proofs are omitted.
Corollary 2.4. If G is a connected, almost-planar graph, then G is a series-parallel extension of
a simple, 3-connected, almost-planar graph.
Corollary 2.5. If G is a disconnected, almost-planar graph, then G is the union of a connected,
almost-planar graph and a set of isolated vertices.

In particular, both corollaries are not “if and only if” type of statements, and (2.4) cannot be turned
into such a statement. Our (ii) corrects both problems.

Proof of Theorem 4.1. We prove implications (ii) ⇒ (i) ⇒ (iii) ⇒ (ii).

(ii) ⇒ (i): Since adding isolated vertices to an almost-planar graph results in an almost-planar
graph, we only need to show that G∗ is almost-planar. This is clear because for each edge e of G∗,
G∗\e is planar if e is an edge obtained by subdividing an edge of D(H), while G∗/e is planar if e
belongs to E(H)\D(H).

(i) ⇒ (iii): As in the proof of (i) ⇒ (iii) of Theorem 1.1, we only need to ﬁnd, for each H ∈ F ′, an
3,3 was settled in the

edge e of H such that both H\e and H/e are nonplanar. The case H = K h

(iii) ⇒ (ii): Suppose the implication does not hold. We choose a counterexample G with |G| as
small as possible. We ﬁrst prove that G is connected. If G is disconnected, since G is nonplanar, one
component of G contains a K5 or K3,3 minor. If another component of G contains an edge, then G
contains K5⊕ e or K3,3⊕ e as a minor. So G must have an isolated vertex v. By the minimality of G,
G\v satisﬁes (ii), which implies G satisﬁes (ii). This contradiction proves that G is connected.

If G has a 1-separation {G1, G2}, since G is nonplanar, at least one Gi contains K5 or K3,3 as a

Since 3-connected {K +

3,3}-free nonplanar graphs are almost-planar, as shown in the
proof of Theorem 1.1 (implications (iv) ⇒ (ii) ⇒ (i)), G cannot be 3-connected and thus G has a
2-separation {G1, G2}. Let V (G1 ∩ G2) = {x, y} and, for i = 1, 2, let Hi = Gi or Gi + xy in case
xy is not an edge of G. Since G is nonplanar, we may assume without loss of generality that H1 is
nonplanar. Note that G1 is planar because otherwise G would contain a K +
3,3 minor. It follows
that xy 6∈ E(G), since H1 is nonplanar.

Let P be an induced path of G2 between x, y. If G2 has a vertex v outside P , then G\v is nonplanar,
because G1 ∪ P , a subdivision of H1, is nonplanar. This implies that G contains a K +
3,3 minor,
which is impossible. Therefore, G2 must equal P and thus G is obtained from H1 by subdividing edge
xy. By the minimality of G, H1 must satisfy (ii). Let H1 be obtained from a 3-connected almost-planar
graph H by subdividing edges in D(H). Each edge of E(H)\D(H) is not subdivided in the formation
of H1 and deleting such an edge in H1 leaves a nonplanar graph. Therefore, xy is not such an edge
since H1\xy = G1 is planar. It follows that there is an edge e ∈ D(H) such that xy belongs to a path
(of H1) obtained by subdividing e. Now it is clear that G is obtained by repeatedly subdividing e, and
thus G satisﬁes (ii), which contradicts the assumption that G is a counterexample. This contradiction
completes our proof.
