A pathwise interpretation of the Gorin-Shkolnikov

identity

Yuu Hariya∗

Abstract

In a recent paper by Gorin and Shkolnikov (2016), they have found, as a
corollary to their result relevant to random matrix theory, that the area below a
normalized Brownian excursion minus one half of the integral of the square of its
total local time, is identical in law with a centered Gaussian random variable with
variance 1/12. In this note, we give a pathwise interpretation to their identity;
Jeulin’s identity connecting normalized Brownian excursion and its local time
plays an essential role in the exposition.

Introduction

Let r = {rt}0≤t≤1 be a normalized Brownian excursion, that is, it is identical in law
with a standard 3-dimensional Bessel bridge, which has the duration [0, 1], and starts
from and ends at the origin; see e.g., [1, Section (2.2)] and references therein for the
deﬁnition of normalized Brownian excursion and its equivalence in law with standard
3-dimensional Bessel bridge. We denote by l = {lx}x≥0 the total local time process of
r; namely, by the occupation time formula, two processes r and l are related via

H(x) := Z 1

1{rt≤x} dt = Z x

ly dy

for all x ≥ 0, a.s.

In a recent paper [2], Gorin and Shkolnikov have found the following remarkable identity
in law as a corollary to one of their results:

Theorem 1.1 ([2], Corollary 2.15). The random variable X deﬁned by

In [2], they have shown that the expected value of the trace of a random operator

indexed by T > 0, arising from random matrix theory, admits the representation

r 2

πT 3

E(cid:20)exp(cid:18)−

T 3/2

X(cid:19)(cid:21)

for any T > 0; in comparison of this expression with the existing literature asserting

that the expected value is equal to p2/(πT 3) exp (T 3/96) for every T > 0, they have

obtained Theorem 1.1 by the analytic continuation and the uniqueness of characteristic
functions.

In this note, we give a proof of Theorem 1.1 without relying on random matrix

theory; Jeulin’s identity in law ([4, p. 264], [1, Proposition 3.6]):

{rt}0≤t≤1

with

lH −1(t)(cid:27)0≤t≤1

(1.2)

H −1(t) := inf {x ≥ 0; H(x) ≥ t} ,

plays a central role in the proof.

2 Proof of Theorem 1.1

In this section, we give a proof of Theorem 1.1 and provide some relevant results.

Proof of Theorem 1.1. Recall from the representation of r by means of a stochastic
diﬀerential equation (see, e.g., [5, Chapter XI, Exercise (3.11)]) that the process W =
{Wt}0≤t≤1 deﬁned by

Wt := rt −Z t

+Z t

(2.1)

is a standard Brownian motion. We integrate both sides over [0, 1] and use Fubini’s
theorem on the right-hand side to see that

Wt dt = Z 1

(2.2)

Note that the left-hand side is a centered Gaussian random variable with variance 1/12.
By Jeulin’s identity (1.2), the right-hand side of (2.2) is identical in law with

(2.3)

We change variables with t = H(x), x ≥ 0, to rewrite (2.3) as

and concludes the proof.

We give a remark on the proof. In what follows we denote

M(r) = max
0≤t≤1

rt.

Remark 2.1. (1) We see from the above proof that the random variables

rt dt,

1

have the same law; they are also identical in law with

1

2 Z t

t
rt

(d)
by the time-reversal: {r1−t}0≤t≤1
= {rt}0≤t≤1. The Laplace transform of the law of
0 rt dt is given in [3, Lemma 4.2] and [1, Proposition (5.5)] in terms of a series expansion.
(2) We see from (1.1) that

R 1

Z ∞

ly dy = Z M (r)

ly dy = 1.

Therefore, to be more speciﬁc, the second integral in (2.4) should be written as

Z M (r)

1 − H(x)

lx

H ′(x) dx.

Using the same reasoning as the above proof, we may obtain the following extension

of Theorem 1.1:

Proposition 2.1. For every positive integer n, the random variable

Z ∞

(1 − H(x))n−1 (lx)2 dx

has the Gaussian distribution with mean zero and variance 1/(2n + 1).

Proof. For each ﬁxed n, we multiply both sides of (2.1) by (1 − t)n−1 and integrate them
over [0, 1]. Then using Fubini’s theorem, we obtain

Z 1

(1 − t)n−1Wt dt =

(2.5)

Since the left-hand side may be expressed as (1/n)R 1

centered Gaussian random variable with variance

0 (1 − t)n dWt, we see that it is a

(1 − t)2n dt =

On the other hand, by Jeulin’s identity (1.2), the right-hand side of (2.5) is identical in
law with

where we used Fubini’s theorem for the second equality. Combining these leads to the
conclusion.

We end this note with a comment on a relevant fact deduced from the proof of

Proposition 2.1.

Remark 2.2. It is well known (see, e.g., [1, Equation (5d)]) that

M(r)

in fact, Jeulin’s identity (1.2) entails that

Combining this fact with a part of the proof of Proposition 2.1, one sees that the
sequence of random variables
