We demonstrate, experimentally and theoretically, a Talbot eﬀect for hybrid light-matter waves —
exciton-polariton condensate formed in a semiconductor microcavity with embedded quantum wells.
The characteristic ‘Talbot carpet’ is produced by loading the exciton-polariton condensate into a
microstructured one dimensional periodic array of mesa traps, which creates an array of sources for
coherent polariton ﬂow in the plane of the quantum wells. The spatial distribution of the Talbot
fringes outside the mesas mimics the near-ﬁeld diﬀraction of a monochromatic wave on a periodic
amplitude and phase grating with the grating period comparable to the wavelength. Despite the
lossy nature of the polariton system, the Talbot pattern persists for distances exceeding the size of
the mesas by an order of magnitude.

Introduction.— Talbot eﬀect is a manifestation of near-
ﬁeld (Fresnel) diﬀraction of a coherent plane wave inci-
dent on a periodic grating, which results in a nontrivial
2D pattern of fringes often referred to as a ‘Talbot car-
pet’. According to the Huygens-Fresnel principle, it is
interpreted as interference of coherent spherical waves
originating from the apertures of the grating. Nearly
two centuries after the discovery of the optical Talbot ef-
fect [1], it continues to be re-discovered and re-examined
in the context of matter and optical waves of various
physical nature and spatial scales. Apart from the linear
and nonlinear optics [2], the Talbot eﬀect has been ob-
served with atoms [3–5], electrons [6], X-rays [7, 8], sin-
gle photons [9], and surface plasmon-polaritons (SPPs)
[10, 12, 13]. The visually stunning eﬀect is not purely of
aesthetic value. Talbot interference has a deep connec-
tion with number theory and theory of quantum revivals
[14, 15], and serves a range of practical purposes.
In-
deed, periodic self-imaging of the source resulting from
the Talbot eﬀect [16] gives rise to grating-based imaging
techniques [7, 8, 17]. Various applications in metrology,
atomic lithography, and optical manipulation have also
been suggested [2].

The common prerequisite for the observation of the
Talbot eﬀect is a periodic arrangement of sources of co-
herent spherical waves that can propagate in the direc-
tion perpendicular to the direction of the array. In optics,
this is naturally achieved by diﬀraction of an incident
light on an array of apertures [2]. However, this eﬀect
can also be reproduced by other means. For example, in
SPP physics Talbot interference of waves from periodi-
cally arranged sources rather than diﬀraction of a plane
wave on a periodic grating has been observed [13].

Recently, experimental investigations of macroscopic

coherent quantum states (bosonic condensates) of micro-
cavity exciton-polaritons [18–20] in one-dimensional (1D)
periodic potentials has received a lot of attention [21–25].
Exciton-polaritons are quasiparticles arising due to hy-
bridisation of an electron-hole pair (exciton) and photon
in a strong light-matter coupling regime. To achieve the
strong coupling, the exciton is spatially conﬁned in a 2D
quantum well grown in an optically pumped semicon-
ductor microcavity, the latter ensuring resonance with
a long-lived photon mode. Periodic potentials for po-
laritons can be formed by surface metal deposition on

the semiconductor microcavity [21, 26, 27], acousting
wave modulation [23, 28], deep etching of micropillars
[22, 25] or microstructuring of buried mesa traps [24, 29]
(see [30] and references therein). These potentials act
as a solid-state superlattice: when a microcavity is opti-
cally pumped, the exciton-polaritons populate the energy
bands of the resulting periodic potentials. Propagation
of coherent polariton waves in the plane of a quantum
well, away of the periodic array, has never been investi-
gated in detail because it is diﬃcult, if not impossible, to
avoid trapping of polaritons in stationary (extended or
localised) states of the 1D array [22, 23].

In this work, we employ an exciton-polariton conden-
sate in a 1D buried mesa array of polariton traps [see
schematics in Fig. 1(a,b)] to observe the Talbot interfer-
ence patterns with coherent hybrid light-matter waves.
The Talbot eﬀect for exciton-polaritons is uniquely en-
abled by the ability of exciton-polaritons to condense into
a non-ground extended (Bloch) state of the 1D array
[24, 29], as well as by the nature of the mesa traps, which
are embedded into the microcavity [29] rather than form-
ing free-standing pillars on the substrate [22]. When the
Bloch mode is characterized by a periodic distribution of
polariton density maxima located in the barriers between
mesa traps, the barrier regions act as sources of polari-
ton waves, which are free to propagate in the plane of
the quantum well [see Fig. 1(b)]. The periodic array of
such sources creates a Talbot carpet shown in Fig. 1(d).
Moreover, we demonstrate that this system mimics both
amplitude and phase gratings for the light-matter waves.
Experiment.— The experiment was performed using
1D mesa arrays microstructured in an AlAs/AlGaAs mi-
crocavity with GaAs quantum wells, as described in [29].
Mesas of 3.5 µm diameter are separated centre-to-centre
by the distance of 5.5 µm, with the eﬀective polariton
potential depth of ∼ 5 meV for each mesa. The exciton-
polariton condensate is formed spontaneously by pump-
ing the microcavity with a cw laser injecting free car-
riers well above the polariton energy. The pump beam
has a FWHM dimension of 2.5 × 36 µm, which illumi-
nates approximately 6 mesas, as shown in Fig. 1(c). Real
and reciprocal space imaging of the cavity photolumi-
nescence resulting from the polariton decay is used to
analyse the spatial density distribution and dispersion of
exciton-polaritons.

In the regime of low excitation powers, the dispersion
(energy vs.
in-plane momentum) of exciton-polaritons
created outside and in the mesa array are remarkably
diﬀerent. Outside the mesa array, the parabolic disper-
sion E(k) near the in-plane momentum k = 0 is typical of
the lower polariton dispersion branch in a planar micro-
cavity, as seen in the Supplemental Material (SM) [31].
In contrast, the emission from polaritons located in mesa
traps reveals the band-gap energy structure [32] imposed
by the periodicity of the trapping potential in the lateral
(x) direction [Fig. 2(a)], as described in [24, 29]. Both

the third (G3) spectral gaps are visible in (b). Dashed yellow
lines correspond to ±kB/2 and mark the ﬁrst Brillouin zone of
the array. The solid lines in (a) show the ﬁrst four extended
Bloch bands calculated from Eq. (1). (c,d) Energy ﬁltered

the discrete energy states in the individual mesas and
the characteristic band-gap spectrum of extended Bloch
states can be seen in Fig. 2(a). The lowest band of Bloch
states is formed above the excited energy state in the in-
dividual mesas, similarly to the spectra of the deep pho-
tonic wires in organic microcavities [33, 34]. The gaps be-
tween the energy bands become progressively narrower,
as can be seen from the spectrum in Fig. 2(a).

At the higher pump powers, exciton-polaritons un-
dergo transition to bosonic condensation. The major-
ity of the condensate populates non-ground steady states
marked by G1 and G3 arrows in Fig. 2(b). These are
weakly spatially localised gap states [35] that, in the nar-
row gaps, are indistinguishable from Bloch modes mod-
ulated by a broad Gaussian envelope. In particular, the
highly populated steady state G3 forms in the very nar-
row third energy gap of the linear spectrum in Fig. 2(a).

Its density and phase distributions are inherited from the
stationary Bloch state at the top of the third spectral
band. Unlike propagating polariton waves, the steady
states trapped in the array are nearly monochromatic.

The reciprocal (k) space image of the emission inten-
sity also undergoes dramatic changes above the exciton-
polariton condensation threshold. At the low power, the
k-space image exhibits a ring-shape distribution due to
the ﬂow of the untrapped polaritons in all directions.
Once the pump power exceeds the condensation thresh-
old, polaritons condense predominantly in the G3 mode
determined by the extended Bloch state of the mesa ar-
ray. This state is characterised by two peaks at the edges
of the third Brillouin zone kx = ±2.85µm−1 visible in
Fig. 2(b) and the corresponding maxima in the k-space
emission pattern Fig. 2(c). Moreover, Fig. 2(c) demon-
strates discrete distribution of the polariton emission in-
tensity in the k-space which suggests additional period-
icity in the transverse (y) direction. This is the direct
consequence of the Talbot eﬀect, which is revealed in the
spatial distribution of the polariton density.

In the G1 state, the majority of the polariton density
is contained within the individual mesas.
In contrast,
the real space density distribution of the G3 state along
the y = 0 line shown in Figs 3(a,d) displays larger po-
lariton density in the potential barrier regions between
the individual mesas. Polaritons in the barrier regions
are free to propagate in the plane of the quantum well,
thus generating coherent ﬂow of polaritons in the trans-
verse direction. Real space image of the polariton ﬂow
outside the mesa array [Figs 3(a)] shows the interference
structure consistent with the linear Talbot eﬀect, with
the spatial periodicity both in the lateral and transverse
directions.

With the growing pumping power above the condensa-
tion threshold, the contrast of the Talbot fringes becomes
enhanced as discussed in SM [31].

Theory.— The full dynamics of exciton-polariton con-
densation in the one-dimensional mesa array for mod-
erate pump powers above threshold can be reliably re-
produced by the two-dimensional mean-ﬁeld dynamical
model taking into account energy relaxation due to quan-
tum and thermal ﬂuctuations in the system [36]. The
detailed description of the model, which describes tran-
sition between diﬀerent energy states occupied by the
condensate in the mesa traps can be found in [24].
It
consists of the open-dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii equation
for the condensate wavefunction incorporating stochas-
tic ﬂuctuations and coupled to the rate equation for the
excitonic reservoir created by the oﬀ-resonant cw pump
[24, 36]. Numerical modelling with the parameters cor-
responding to our experiment reproduces condensation
into a non-ground steady state state with the real space
density distribution shown in Fig. 3(b).
It reveals the
Talbot pattern in qualitative agreement with the exper-
iment.
In what follows, we present a simple, intuitive

theory of this eﬀect based on its analogy with the linear
near-ﬁeld diﬀraction.

i.e.,

In the low density regime,

for the excitation
powers below the condensation threshold, the exciton-
polaritons occupy the band-gap ladder of single-particle
energy states in a periodic potential (see, e.g., [29] for
details of the potential characterisation). The energy
band structure En(k), where n is the band index, can
be calculated directly by solving the stationary single-
particle Schr¨odinger equation for the macroscopic wave-
function of the polariton condensate ψ(x, y) in a periodic
in-plane potential. Due to the 1D nature of the lateral pe-
riodicity, the dimensionality reduction can be performed,
and eigenvalues approximated by the spectrum of the
factorised eigenstates ψ(x, y) = χ(y)φk(x) exp(−ikx),
where χ(y) is a transverse mode of an individual mesa
trap, and φk(x) = φk(x + a) are the extended polariton
Bloch states in an eﬀective 1D potential V (x) = V (x + a)
with the in-plane momentum k ≡ kx. The 1D Bloch
states obey the following equation:

(cid:21)

(cid:20) 2

2mp

(k − i∇x)2 + V (x)

φn,k(x) = En(k)φn,k(x). (1)

Here mp ≈ 4.45 × 10−5me is the eﬀective polariton mass
in the planar region, and me is the free electron mass.
We approximate the 1D periodic potential created by
the mesas by the anharmonic analytical function V (x) =
V0 [F (x) − 1], where:

F (x) =

(1 + s)2 [1 + cos(kBx)]
2 [1 + s2 + 2s cos(kBx)]

,

and kB = 2π/a is the size of the Brillouin zone of the pe-
riodic potential. The shapes of the potential for varying
degrees of anharmonicity are described in [37].
The band-gap spectrum En(kx) calculated using
Eq. (1) for the anharmonicity parameter s = −0.2 and
the potential depth V0 = 5.2 meV, assuming the trans-
verse ground state of the mesa χ(y) = χ0(y), demon-
strates good agreement with the experimentally mea-
sured spectrum, as seen in Fig. 2(a). We note, however,
that the multitude of populated energy bands visible in
Fig. 2(a) includes extended states formed by hybridis-
ation of the higher-order two-dimensional modes of the
individual mesa traps. One of such bands, weakly popu-
lated by low-density polaritons, is seen in Fig. 2(b) below
the state G1.

The lateral density distribution for the polariton Bloch
mode giving raise to the G3 state emission in Fig. 2(b) is
well reproduced by our model. The calculated density of
the Bloch state φB(x) ≡ φ3,kB /2(x) and the correspond-
ing experimental intensity of the polariton emission along
the x axis are shown in Fig. 3(d). The highest peaks of
|φB(x)| are located in the local maxima of V (x) which
correspond to the barrier regions of the mesa array. This
Bloch state belongs to the top edge of the third energy

band (n = 3) and therefore is a ’π-state’ with a staggered
phase, i.e. its adjacent density peaks have π phase diﬀer-
ence. This phase diﬀerence is inherited by the transverse
ﬂow of polaritons, which in turn leads to some charac-
teristic features in the Talbot pattern. Conversely, from
the intensity of the polariton emission in the Talbot pat-
tern one can reliably infer the phase distribution of the
condensate wavefunction φB(x) in the mesa array.

The Talbot pattern can be reproduced by applying
the linear Huygens-Fresnel principle to the polariton
ﬂow, thus assuming that polariton waves propagating
away from the mesa array are of suﬃciently low par-
ticle density, so that the nonlinearity can be ignored.
As indicated by the lateral period of the Talbot pat-
tern, only the highest peaks of |φB(x)|2 act as sources of
the coherent polariton ﬂow. According to the Huygens-
Fresnel principle, the condensate in the barrier regions
can be represented by an array of point sources of de-
caying radial waves whose ﬁeld is given by [36]: fm ∼
√
(1/
is the relative distance between a point on the plane, r,
and the position of the m-th source, rm, kp = 2π/λp is
the polariton wavevector, κ = γmp/(2kp) is determined
by the polariton decay rate γ, and θm is the initial phase
inherited from φB(x). The total ﬁeld of the Talbot car-
pet is given by the linear superposition of waves from all
m fm, which, in our case, are located

r) exp[i(kprm +θm)−κrm], where rm =(cid:112)|r − rm|2

sources: fT (r) =(cid:80)

on the line y = 0.

Figure 3(c) shows the Talbot pattern reproduced by
the linear theory assuming the polariton wavelength
λp = 2.6 µm and the polariton lifetime γ−1 ∼ 10 ps.
The real space image is in excellent agreement with the
experimental pattern Fig. 3(a). The dark lines located
between bright lobes result from destructive interference
between the adjacent sources due to the relative π phase
diﬀerence. Away from the x axis, the pattern distorts
and eventually vanishes because of the ﬁnite number of
sources and polariton decay. Nevertheless, the pattern
persists for distances suﬃcient to re-image the source
twice. Finally, the calculated Fourier transform of the
Talbot pattern fT (r) matches the experimental k-space
signature very well [cf. Figs. 2(c) and 2(d)]. The discrep-
ancies between the calculated and experimental images
stem from the theoretical assumption of distributed point
sources located on y = 0, whereas in practice each source
has a ﬁnite transverse extent.

The Talbot length is deﬁned as the transverse distance
at which the phase shift of all plane wave sources is equal
to 2πN , where N is an integer. At this distance, the orig-
inal density distribution at y = 0 is revived. Remarkably,
in our case the Talbot pattern demonstrates the complete
revival at half the Talbot length L/2 [see Figs. 3(a,c)].
This is because the array of coherent polariton sources
created by the Bloch state mimics both amplitude and
phase gratings. At the transverse distance L/2, the
phase of each source acquires a π shift, thus reproducing

the staggered phase structure and the polariton density
(emission intensity) pattern of the origin. The Talbot
length determined from the transverse period of the pat-
tern in the experimental real-space image is L ≈ 20 µm.
The wavelength of the coherent polariton wave is compa-
rable to the period of the mesa array (a = 5.5 µm), and
can be calculated using the non-paraxial correction to the
p/a2]−1,
which yields λp ≈ 2.8 µm. This value agrees well both
with that assumed in our theoretical calculations above,
and with the de Broglie wavelength of the transversely
free polaritons with the energy Ep = 5.81 meV [state G3

Rayleigh formula [13, 16]: L = λp[1 −(cid:113)
in Fig. 2(b)]: λdB = h/(cid:112)2mpEp = 2.4 µm.

1 − λ2

Finally, we note that the Talbot interference of exciton-
polaritons is an ubiquitous eﬀect. However, not every
higher-order exciton-polariton mode responsible for leak-
ing into the planar regions and generating Talbot pat-
terns may be captured by our simple 1D theory, as dis-
cussed in SM [31].

Conclusions.— To summarise, we demonstrate the
Talbot eﬀect for an exciton-polariton condensate loaded
into a one-dimensional array of mesa traps. The Tal-
bot pattern is formed due to condensation of exciton-
polaritons into a non-ground energy state which has pro-
nounced density peaks in the barrier regions between
mesas. Polaritons at these locations are free to prop-
agate transversely to the mesa array and therefore the
barrier regions act as a periodic array of sources of co-
herent polariton waves. Due to the nontrivial phase of
the non-ground state in the array, these sources mimic

both amplitude and phase gratings for the light-matter
waves, which links our observations to the Lohmann ef-
fect [38]. Moreover, the period of the grating is compara-
ble to the wavelength of the coherent light-matter waves,
which provides opportunity for exploring non-paraxial ef-
fects on the microscale. Numerical calculations exploit-
ing a mean-ﬁeld nonlinear model of polariton conden-
sation, as well as the linear Huygens-Fresnel diﬀraction
theory, allow us to reproduce the spatial distribution and
spectral signatures of the Talbot eﬀect.

Our results represent the ﬁrst, to the best of our knowl-
edge, observation of the Talbot eﬀect with hybrid light-
matter waves. This research opens the avenue for using
the current advanced nanofabrication techniques to en-
gineer ﬂow patterns of exciton-polaritons in the plane
of the quantum wells embedded in the microcavity. In
particular, lensing, beam splitting, and phase-dependent
shaping of polariton ﬂows enabled by the Talbot eﬀect
could be realised [11, 12]. The resulting control over in-
plane polariton propagation could aid the development
of integrated polaritonic devices.
