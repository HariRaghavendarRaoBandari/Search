RUARI WALKER

Abstract. This paper is investigative work into the properties of a family of graded algebras recently

deﬁned by Varagnolo and Vasserot, which we call VV algebras. We compare categories of modules over

KLR algebras with categories of modules over VV algebras, establishing various Morita equivalences.

Using these Morita equivalences we are able to prove several properties of certain classes of VV algebras

such as (graded) aﬃne cellularity and aﬃne quasi-heredity.

Introduction

Varagnolo and Vasserot have recently deﬁned a new family of graded algebras, the representation theory
of which is closely related to the representation theory of the aﬃne Hecke algebras of type B. Indeed,
they prove in [VV11] that categories of ﬁnite-dimensional modules over these algebras are equivalent to
categories of ﬁnite-dimensional modules over aﬃne Hecke algebras of type B, HB
n . They also use these
algebras to prove a conjecture of Enomoto and Kashiwara which states that the representations of the
aﬃne Hecke algebra of type B categorify a simple highest weight module for a certain quantum group
(see [EK09]). These are the main motivating reasons behind studying these algebras. Throughout this
work we refer to these algebras as VV algebras. One of the advantages of working with VV algebras
is that they have a non-trivial grading, whilst aﬃne Hecke algebras of type B do not. Similarly to
KLR algebras, VV algebras depend upon a quiver Γ, which now comes equipped with an involution θ,
and a dimension vector ν which is invariant under this involution. The vertices of Γ are labelled by an
indexing set I which is an orbit arising from a Z ⋊ Z2-action on the ground ﬁeld. They also depend
upon two non-zero elements of the ﬁeld, p and q, which correspond to the deformation parameters of
HB

n . It turns out that there are diﬀerent cases to consider when studying VV algebras;

(A1) p, q 6∈ I
q ∈ I, p 6∈ I
(A2)
(A3) p ∈ I, q 6∈ I

One can also consider the case where both p, q ∈ I which we do not treat here.

In this paper we compare categories of modules over KLR algebras with categories of modules over
VV algebras. In case (A1) we ﬁnd that these module categories are indeed equivalent. In other cases
we ﬁnd categories of modules over VV algebras are equivalent to categories of modules over the tensor
product of KLR algebras with the path algebra of a certain quiver. Using these Morita equivalences,
many properties of KLR algebras, and the given path algebra, can be transferred to classes of VV
algebras. In particular, the main result of this work is that certain subclasses of VV algebras are aﬃne
cellular and even aﬃne quasi-hereditary.

Theorem (Main Result) (2.32, 2.33, 2.39, 2.40). Let ν ∈ θNI. If p is not a root of unity and we
are either in case (A1) or case (A2) with the additional assumption that ν has multiplicity one, the
algebras Wν are (graded) aﬃne cellular and aﬃne quasi-hereditary.

In Section 1, we deﬁne KLR algebras of type A and the VV algebras, which are our main objects of
study, and prove a proposition which shows how these algebras are related. Namely, under certain
conditions, KLR algebras are idempotent subalgebras of VV algebras. That is, there is an algebra

isomorphism eWνe ∼= R˜ν, for a certain ˜ν ∈ NI and an idempotent e ∈ Wν.

Section 2 starts with why we may assume the dimension vector ν deﬁning the VV algebra Wν has
connected support.

Theorem (2.8). Let I, J be two Z ⋊ Z2-orbits such that I ∩ J = ∅. Then, for ν = ν1 + ν2 ∈ θN(I ∪ J)
with ν1 ∈ θNI and ν2 ∈ θNJ, Wν and Wν1 ⊗k Wν2 are Morita equivalent.
We then consider various classes of VV algebras and compare their module categories with module
categories over KLR algebras. In particular, in the case p, q 6∈ I we ﬁnd Morita equivalence between
VV algebras and KLR algebras.

Theorem (2.10). In case (A1), the algebras Wν and R˜ν are Morita equivalent.

Section 2 also introduces the notions of aﬃne cellularity, as deﬁned by Koenig and Xi in [KX12], and
aﬃne quasi-heredity as deﬁned by Kleshchev in [Kle15]. We then prove some statements about aﬃne
quasi-hereditary algebras and show, in the case q ∈ I, p 6∈ I, when ν has multiplicity one, that the
VV algebras are (graded) aﬃne cellular and aﬃne quasi-hereditary. To do this we prove the following
result, where A and ˜A are the path algebras of a given quiver.

Theorem (2.18). If p not a root of unity and we are in the case (A2) with ν of multiplicity one, the
algebras Wν and A⊗(m−1) ⊗ ˜A are Morita equivalent.
At the end of Section 2 we show that when we relax this multiplicity condition imposed on ν we obtain
the following Morita equivalence.

Theorem (2.43). In case (A2), when q has multiplicity one in ν, the algebras Wν and R+
Morita equivalent.

˜ν ⊗k[z]

˜A are

At the end of Section 2 we prove a Morita equivalence statement in the case p ∈ I, q 6∈ I, p not a root
of unity, where p has multiplicity exactly two in ν.

Theorem (2.46). If p is not a root of unity and we are in the case (A3), when p has multiplicity two
in ν, the algebras Wν and R+

˜A are Morita equivalent.

1. KLR Algebras and VV Algebras

1.1. Preliminaries. Throughout this work k will denote a ﬁeld with characteristic not equal to 2.
Any grading will always mean a Z-grading. We start by introduce the notion of graded dimension
for a graded module over a k-algebra A. We write q to be both a formal variable and a degree shift

functor, shifting the degree by 1. That is, for a graded A-module M =Ln∈Z Mn, qM is again a graded

A-module with (qM )k = Mk−1. The graded A-module M is said to be locally ﬁnite-dimensional if each
graded component Mk is ﬁnite-dimensional. In this case the graded dimension of M is deﬁned to be

where dim(Mn) is the dimension of Mn over k.

dimqM =Xn∈Z

(dim(Mn))qn

Example 1.1. Let k be a ﬁeld and consider the polynomial ring k[x]. As a k-vector space, k[x] has a
basis {1, x, x2, x3, . . .}. Each graded component is of dimension 1. Then,

dimqk[x] = Xn∈Z≥0

qn =

1
1 − q

.

1.2. KLR Algebras. In this section we deﬁne a family of algebras which were introduced by Kho-
vanov, Lauda and independently by Rouquier. They are known as KLR algebras, or sometimes as
quiver Hecke algebras.

Fix an element p ∈ k×. Deﬁne an action of Z on k× as follows,

Let ˜I be a Z-orbit. So ˜I = ˜Iλ is the Z-orbit of λ,

n · λ = p2nλ.

˜I = ˜Iλ = {p2nλ | n ∈ Z}.

To ˜I we associate a quiver ˜Γ = ˜Γ ˜I . The vertices of ˜Γ are the elements i ∈ ˜I and we have arrows
p2i −→ i for every i ∈ ˜I. We always assume that ±1 /∈ ˜I and that p 6= ±1.
Now deﬁne N ˜I = {˜ν = Pi∈ ˜I ˜νii | ˜ν has ﬁnite support, ˜νi ∈ Z≥0 ∀i}. Elements ˜ν ∈ N ˜I are called
dimension vectors. For ˜ν ∈ N ˜I, the height of ˜ν is deﬁned to be

For ˜ν ∈ N ˜I with |˜ν| = m, deﬁne

˜νi.

|˜ν| =Xi∈ ˜I

m

˜I ˜ν := {i = (i1, . . . , im) ∈ ˜I m |

ik = ˜ν}.

Xk=1

Deﬁnition 1.2. ˜ν =Pi∈ ˜I ˜νii ∈ N ˜I is said to have multiplicity one if ˜νi ≤ 1 for every i ∈ ˜I. We say
that j ∈ ˜I has multiplicity one in ˜ν, or j appears with multiplicity one in ˜ν, if the coeﬃcient of j in ˜ν
is 1, i.e. if ˜νj = 1.
Example 1.3. ˜ν1 = λ + p2λ ∈ N ˜Iλ has multiplicity one, while ˜ν2 = 2λ + p2λ does not have multiplicity
one. In the latter example, p2λ appears with multiplicity one in ˜ν2.

Deﬁnition 1.4. For ˜ν ∈ N ˜I with |˜ν| = m the KLR algebra, denoted by R˜ν, is the graded k-algebra
generated by elements

{x1, . . . , xm} ∪ {σ1, . . . , σm−1} ∪ {e(i) | i ∈ ˜I ˜ν}

which are subject to the following relations.

(1) e(i)e(j) = δije(i), σke(i) = e(ski)σk, xle(i) = e(i)xl, Pi∈ ˜I ˜ν e(i) = 1.

deg(σke(i)) =( |ik → ik+1| + |ik+1 → ik|

If ˜ν = 0 we set R˜ν = k as a graded k-algebra.

Remark 1.5. In this paper the underlying quiver ˜Γ for KLR algebras is always of type A however,
KLR algebras can be deﬁned more generally.
At this point we introduce some notation. Take any ˜ν ∈ N ˜I, of height |˜ν| = n, and the associated KLR
algebra R˜ν. Whenever we work with the KLR algebra R˜ν, for each w ∈ Sn, we must choose and ﬁx a
reduced expression of w, say w = si1 ··· sir where 1 ≤ ik < n, for all k. Then deﬁne σ ˙w ∈ R˜ν as follows.

σ ˙we(i) = σi1σi2 ··· σir e(i)
σ ˙1e(i) = e(i)

where 1 denotes the identity element in Sn. Note that reduced expressions of w are not always unique
and so σ ˙w depends upon the choice of reduced expression of w. For example, sisi+1si = si+1sisi+1 in

Sn, whereas the deﬁning relations for the KLR algebra state that we do not always have σiσi+1σie(i) =
σi+1σiσi+1e(i). In particular, this means that for elements w1, w2 ∈ Sn, w1 = w2 does not necessarily
imply σ ˙w1e(i) = σ ˙w2e(i).

Note 1.6. If we have ﬁxed a reduced expression for w we will usually omit the dot and write σw for
σ ˙w.
Lemma 1.7 (Basis Theorem for KLR Algebras). [[KL09], Theorem 2.5] Take ˜ν ∈ N ˜I with |˜ν| = m.
The elements

{σ ˙wxn1

1 ··· xnm

m e(i) | w ∈ Sm, i ∈ I ˜ν, ni ∈ N0 ∀i}

form a k-basis for R˜ν.

1.3. Root Partitions Associated to R˜ν. To each i ∈ ˜I we associate an integer n; the power of p
at that vertex. For example, to p2λ we associate 2. To p−4λ we associate −4. If p ∈ ˜I; to the vertex
p2k+1, k ∈ Z we associate 2k + 1. So i ∈ ˜I is identiﬁed with an integer and refers to the power of p at
that vertex. The order on ˜I is the natural order on Z.

Associated to the quiver Γ = Γ ˜I , with vertex set ˜I, is a Cartan matrix (aij)i,j∈ ˜I deﬁned by

ai,j :=




if i = j
if i = j
if i → j or i ← j
if i ⇆ j.

Let (h, Π, Π∨) be a realisation of this Cartan matrix. We have simple roots in type A given by {αi |
i ∈ ˜I}, and positive roots αi,i+2k := αi + αi+2 + ··· + αi+2k, k ∈ Z≥0. We order the roots as follows.

αi + αi+2 + ··· + αi+2k > αj + αj+2 + ··· + αj+2l ⇐⇒ i > j or i = j and k > l.

Deﬁnition 1.8. A root partition of ˜ν is a tuple of positive roots (β1, β2, β3, . . . , βr) such that ˜ν =
β1 + β2 + β3 + ··· + βr and such that β1 ≥ β2 ≥ β3 ≥ ··· ≥ βr.
A root partition of ˜ν will often be denoted by π and the set of all root partitions of ˜ν will be denoted
by Π(˜ν).
Example 1.9. Take ˜ν = λ + p2λ + p4λ + p6λ ∈ N ˜Iλ. (λ + p2λ + p4λ + p6λ), (p6λ, λ + p2λ + p4λ),
(p6λ, p2λ + p4λ, λ), are root partitions of ˜ν. Denote them as π1, π2, π3, respectively. We have

π1 < π2 < π3

and iπ1 = (λ, p2λ, p4λ, p6λ), iπ2 = (p6λ, λ, p2λ, p4λ), iπ3 = (p6λ, p2λ, p4λ, λ).
Given ˜ν ∈ N ˜I and the associated KLR algebra R˜ν, we have a set {e(i) | i ∈ ˜I ˜ν} of idempotents. Each
e(i) is labelled by a sequence of integers i = (i1, . . . , im) ∈ ˜I m which may or may not correspond to a
root partition in the way we describe above. So, associated to each KLR algebra R˜ν we obtain a set of
root partitions of ˜ν. In fact, since all permutations of (i1, . . . , im) lie in ˜I m, we obtain a complete set of
root partitions of ˜ν. If i = (i1, . . . , im) corresponds to a root partition π ∈ Π(˜ν) then we will sometimes
write e(iπ) = e(i) to emphasise this.

1.4. VV Algebras. In this section we deﬁne the family of algebras of which this paper is concerned;
the VV algebras. They were introduced by Varagnolo and Vasserot in [VV11].

Fix elements p, q ∈ k×. Assume that p is not a power of q and that q is not a power of p. Deﬁne an
action of Z ⋊ Z2 on k× as follows.

(n, ε) · λ = p2nλε.
Let I be a Z ⋊ Z2-orbit. So I = Iλ is the Z ⋊ Z2-orbit of λ.

I = Iλ = {p2nλ±1 | n ∈ Z}.

To I we associate a quiver Γ = ΓI together with an involution θ. The vertices of Γ are the elements
i ∈ I and we have arrows p2i −→ i for every i ∈ I. The involution θ is deﬁned by

θ(i) = i−1

θ(p2i −→ i) = p−2i−1 ←− i−1,

for all i ∈ I.

We always assume that ±1 /∈ I and that p 6= ±1. This implies that θ has no ﬁxed points and that Γ
has no loops (1-cycles).

Now deﬁne θNI := {ν = Pi∈I νii | ν has ﬁnite support, νi ∈ Z≥0, νi = νθ(i) ∀i}. In particular, for
each ν ∈ θNI, the coeﬃcients of i and i−1 in ν must be equal. Elements ν ∈ θNI are called dimension
vectors. For ν ∈ θNI the height of ν is deﬁned to be,
|ν| =Xi∈I
νi.

The shape of Γ depends on whether p ∈ I or p 6∈ I, as well as whether or not p is a root of unity.

• Suppose p 6∈ I. Let I +
• Now suppose p ∈ I. Let I +

λ := {p2nλ | n ∈ Z}, I −

λ := {p2nλ−1 | n ∈ Z}. So Iλ = I −

λ ⊔ I +
λ .

p := {p2n+1 | n ∈ Z≥0}, I −

p := {p2n−1 | n ∈ Z≤0}. So Ip = I −

Note that for ν ∈ θNI, |ν| = 2m for some positive integer m. For ν ∈ θNI with |ν| = 2m, deﬁne

Deﬁnition 1.10. A dimension vector ν = Pi∈I νii ∈ θNI is said to have multiplicity one if νi ≤ 1
for every i ∈ I. We say that j ∈ I has multiplicity one in ν, or j appears with multiplicity one in ν, if
the coeﬃcient of j in ν is 1, i.e. if νj = 1.

Remark 1.11. We remark here that, given this data, we can again deﬁne KLR algebras. That is,
given a Z ⋊ Z2-orbit Iλ and associated quiver ΓIλ we can pick ˜ν ∈ NIλ which yields a KLR algebra R˜ν.
This KLR algebra is deﬁned by the generators and relations given in 1.2 with the understanding that
there are no arrows between vertices belonging to diﬀerent branches of ΓIλ.

Deﬁnition 1.12. For ν ∈ θNI with |ν| = 2m the VV algebra, denoted by Wν, is the graded k-algebra
generated by elements

{x1, . . . , xm} ∪ {σ1, . . . , σm−1} ∪ {e(i) | i ∈ θI ν} ∪ {π}

if ik = ik+1.
where |ik → ik+1| denotes the number of arrows from ik to ik+1 in the quiver Γ.

If ν = 0 we set Wν = k as a graded k-algebra.

Remark 1.13. Every ν ∈ θNI can be written as
ν = Xi∈I +

νii + Xi∈I −

νii.

by R+

Setting ˜ν = Pi∈I + νii ∈ NI + deﬁnes a KLR algebra. Denote the KLR algebra associated to ˜ν ∈ NI +
˜ν . For the remainder of this paper, for ν =Pi∈I + νii +Pi∈I − νii ∈ θNI, ˜ν will be used to denote
Pi∈I + νii ∈ NI +. Sometimes we write ˜ν = ˜ν+ to make this explicit.
Similarly, setting ˜ν− = Pi∈I − νii ∈ NI − also deﬁnes a KLR algebra. Denote the KLR algebra as-
sociated to ˜ν− ∈ NI − by R−
˜ν .
The relations above, and therefore the algebras Wν , depend on the following four cases.
(1) The case p, q 6∈ I. In this setting ΓIλ is of type A∞

∞ ⊔ A∞
r ⊔ A(1)

rth primitive root of unity then ΓIλ is of type A(1)
since ±1 6∈ I.

(2) The case p ∈ I and q 6∈ I. If p ∈ I and p is not a root of unity then ΓIp has type A∞

∞ and ΓIp is

of type A(1)
r

if p2 is an rth root of unity.

(3) The case q ∈ I and p 6∈ I. In this setting ΓIq is of type A∞

∞ if p is not a root of unity. If p

∞ ⊔ A∞

is a root of unity then ΓIq is of type A(1)

r ⊔ A(1)
r .

(4) The case p, q ∈ I. In this case Ip = Iq. That is,

{p2n+1 | n ∈ Z} = {p2nq±1 | n ∈ Z}.

If q = p2n, for some n ∈ Z, then ±1 ∈ I, which we have ruled out. So we must have q = p2n+1 for
some n ∈ Z.

Here we introduce some notation similar to the notation used for KLR algebras. Take any ν ∈ θNI, of
height |ν| = 2m, and the associated VV algebra Wν. Whenever we work with the VV algebra Wν, for
each w ∈ W B
m , we must choose and ﬁx a reduced expression, say w = si1 ··· sir where 0 ≤ ik < m, for
all k. Then deﬁne σ ˙w ∈ Wν as follows.

σ ˙we(i) = σi1σi2 ··· σir e(i)
σ ˙1e(i) = e(i)

m are not always unique and so σ ˙w depends upon the choice of reduced expression of w.

m . As with elements of the symmetric group, reduced expressions

where 1 is the identity element in W B
of w ∈ W B
Note 1.14. If we have ﬁxed a reduced expression for w ∈ W B
σw instead of σ ˙w.

m we will usually omit the dot and write

For each ν ∈ θNI, with |ν| = 2m, deﬁne θFν to be a polynomial ring in the xk at each e(i). More
precisely,

θFν := Mi∈θI ν

k[x1e(i), . . . , xme(i)].

Proposition 1.15 ([VV11], Proposition 7.5). The k-algebra Wν is a free (left or right) θFν-module
n }. It has rank 2mm!. The operator σ ˙we(i) is homogeneous and its degree is
on basis {σ ˙w | w ∈ W B
independent of the choice of reduced expression of

˙w.

That is,

Then we have a k-basis for VV algebras, as follows.

Wν = M{σ ˙w|w∈W B

m}

θFν.

Lemma 1.16 (Basis Theorem for VV Algebras). Take ν ∈ NI with |ν| = 2m. The elements

{σ ˙wxn1

1 ··· xnm

m e(i) | w ∈ W B

m , i ∈ θI ν , nk ∈ N0 ∀k}

form a k-basis for Wν.

1.5. KLR Algebras as Idempotent Subalgebras. The following proposition provides more of an
understanding of the relationship between KLR algebras and VV algebras.

Proposition 1.17. For any ν ∈ θNI we can write ν =Pi∈I νii +Pi∈I νii−1 and set ˜ν =Pi∈I νii. If
i + i−1 is not a summand of ˜ν, for any i ∈ I, then ˜ν yields an idempotent subalgebra R˜ν of Wν.
Proof. We will show that there is an algebra isomorphism

eWν e ∼= R˜ν where e = Xi∈I ˜ν

e(i).

m /Sm) denote the minimal length left coset representatives of Sm in W B

Let Dm := D(W B
m . Fix a
reduced expression ˙s for every s ∈ Sm. It is well-known (see [GP00] Proposition (2.1.1), for example)
that every w ∈ W B
m can be written uniquely in the form ηs, for η ∈ Dm, s ∈ Sm, with ℓ(ηs) = ℓ(η)+ℓ(s).
For every w ∈ W B
m ﬁx a reduced expression ˙w = ˙η ˙s. By the basis theorem for VV algebras 1.16, any

Claim 1.18. For η ∈ D(W B

This is clear when η = 1. So suppose that η 6= 1. We prove by induction on m that eσηe = 0.

For m = 1 we have D1 = {1, s0} and ˜ν = a ∈ NI. Clearly eσ0e = eπe = 0. Now for any ˜ν ∈ NI of
height k < m assume eσηe = 0 for all η ∈ Dk.

Take ˜ν ∈ NI of height m and η ∈ Dm \ Dm−1. Then, η = ¯ηsm−1 ··· s1s0, for ¯η ∈ Dm−1. Consider one
summand of e, say e(a1, . . . , am). Then,

From 1.7 we know {σsxn1

isomorphism of k-vector spaces. On inspection of the deﬁning relations of the KLR algebras and VV

Remark 1.19. Using the notation from Remark 1.13, every VV algebra Wν has idempotent subalge-
bras R−

˜ν and R+
˜ν .

Example 1.20. Take ν = p−2λ−1+λ−1+λ+p2λ ∈ θNI. The algebra R+
˜ν , corresponding to ˜ν = λ+p2λ,
is always an idempotent subalgebra of Wν, as is R−
˜ν which is the KLR algebra corresponding to
˜ν = λ−1 + p−2λ−1. But R˜ν is also an idempotent subalgebra for ˜ν = λ−1 + p2λ and for ˜ν = λ + p−2λ−1.
In this example Wν has four KLR algebras appearing as idempotent subalgebras.

Example 1.21. Take ν = 2p−1 + 2p ∈ θNIp. The algebra R˜ν , for ˜ν = p + p−1, is not an idempotent
subalgebra of Wν. In this example, the only idempotent subalgebras isomorphic to KLR algebras are

Recall, from Section 1.4, we ﬁxed an element p ∈ k× in order to deﬁne an action of Z ⋊ Z2 on
k×. We then ﬁxed a Z ⋊ Z2-invariant subset Iλ of k×, for some λ ∈ k×, and deﬁned a family of VV
algebras from this data. In this section we will deﬁne families of VV algebras in a slightly more general
setting and then show that in fact it suﬃces to study the families of VV algebras as deﬁned in Section
1.4. We again ﬁx elements p, q ∈ k× and keep the action of Z ⋊ Z2 on k× as before, namely,

(n, ε) · λ = p2nλε.

Let I, J ⊂ k× be Z ⋊ Z2-orbits with I ∩ J = ∅. To I ∪ J we associate a quiver Γ = ΓI∪J together with
an involution θ. The vertices of Γ are the elements i ∈ I ∪ J and we have arrows p2i −→ i for every
i ∈ I ∪ J. The involution θ is deﬁned as before;

θ(i) = i−1

θ(p2i −→ i) = p−2i−1 ←− i−1

for all i ∈ I ∪ J.

Deﬁne θN(I ∪ J) := {ν =Pi∈I∪J νii | ν has ﬁnite support, νi ∈ Z≥0, νi = νθ(i) ∀i}. For ν ∈ θN(I ∪ J),

the height of ν is deﬁned to be

Deﬁnition 2.2. For ν ∈ θN(I ∪ J) with |ν| = 2m the separated VV algebra, denoted Wν , is the
graded k-algebra generated by elements

{x1, . . . , xm} ∪ {σ1, . . . , σm−1} ∪ {e(i) | i ∈ θ(I ∪ J)ν} ∪ {π}

which are subject to the relations given in Deﬁnition 1.12 with the understanding that there are no
arrows between between vertices coming from I and those coming from J.

The grading on Wν is deﬁned as follows.

deg(e(i)) = 0

deg(xle(i)) = 2

deg(πe(i)) =( 1
deg(σke(i)) =( |ik → ik+1| + |ik+1 → ik|

if i1 = q±1
if i1 6= q±1

0

−2

if ik 6= ik+1
if ik = ik+1

where |ik → ik+1| denotes the number of arrows from ik to ik+1 in the quiver ΓI∪J .

If ν = 0 we set Wν = k as a graded k-algebra.
Remark 2.3. Take ν ∈ θN(I ∪ J) and the separated VV algebra Wν. We emphasise here that there
are no arrows between any i ∈ I and j ∈ J. So, for some e(i) with ik = i and ik+1 = j, it is always the
case that σ2

ke(i) = e(i).

Note 2.4. Fix ν ∈ θN(I ∪ J). We can write ν = ν1 + ν2, for ν1 ∈ θNI and ν2 ∈ θNJ. We note here
that (i1, . . . , im1 , j1, . . . , jm2 ) ∈ θ(I ∪ J)ν for any (i1, . . . , im1) ∈ θI ν1 and any (j1, . . . , jm2 ) ∈ θJ ν2. We
will write (ij) for such a tuple, where i = (i1, . . . , im1 ) ∈ θI ν1 and j = (j1, . . . , jm2 ) ∈ θJ ν2.
Let e = P i∈θI ν1
eWνe ∼= Wν1 ⊗k Wν2, from which it follows that Wν and Wν1 ⊗k Wν2 are Morita equivalent.

From here until the end of this section we ﬁx the following notation. Let I, J ⊂ k× be Z ⋊ {±1}-
orbits with I ∩ J = ∅. Take ν ∈ θN(I ∪ J) and write ν = ν1 + ν2, for ν1 ∈ θNI with |ν1| = m1 and
ν2 ∈ θNJ with |ν2| = m2. Let m = m1 + m2. Set e :=P i∈θI ν1
e(ij), using the notation as in Note 2.4.

One can check that φ really is a well-deﬁned group homomorphism by checking the relations.

The homomorphism φ is surjective since it is surjective on the generators of Q. Then, since |W B

Proposition 2.6. There is a k-algebra isomorphism Wν1 ⊗k Wν2 ∼= eWν e.

Proof. Deﬁne a map ψ : Wν1 ⊗k Wν2 −→ eWν1+ν2e by,

e(i) ⊗ e(j) 7→ e(ij)

xke(i) ⊗ e(j) 7→ xke(ij) 1 ≤ k ≤ m1
σke(i) ⊗ e(j) 7→ σke(ij) 1 ≤ k ≤ m1 − 1
πe(i) ⊗ e(j) 7→ πe(ij)
e(i) ⊗ xke(j) 7→ xm1+ke(ij) 1 ≤ k ≤ m2
e(i) ⊗ σke(j) 7→ σm1+ke(ij) 1 ≤ k ≤ m2 − 1
e(i) ⊗ πe(j) 7→ σm1 ··· σ1πσ1 ··· σm1e(ij),

extending k-linearly and multiplicatively. Then, by inspection of the deﬁning relations, one can see
m be the subgroup of W B
that ψ is well-deﬁned and is therefore a morphism of k-algebras. Let Q ⊂ W B
m
as in Lemma 2.5. For each w ∈ Q, ﬁx a reduced expression and consider

B′ = {σwxn1

1 ··· xnm

m e(ij) | w ∈ Q, nk ∈ N0 ∀k, i ∈ θI ν1, j ∈ θJ ν2}.

This set is linearly independent because it is a subset of the basis given for VV algebras in Lemma 1.16.
B′ spans eWν1+ν2e because the w ∈ Q are precisely the elements of W B
m that permute the (i1, . . . , im1 )
and the (j1, . . . , jm2 ), and which do not intertwine elements ir ∈ I with elements jt ∈ J. So B′ is a
k-basis for eWν1+ν2e.

We can now calculate the graded dimension of these algebras and show that they are indeed equal. First
we calculate the graded dimension of eWν e using B′. The polynomial part of this basis contributes a

= deg(σsm2−1e(j)).

Similarly, deg(σsie(ij)) = deg(σsie(i)) for all 0 ≤ i ≤ m1 − 1. Hence,

deg(σwe(ij)) = deg(σue(i)) + deg(σve(j))

To prove the claimed result it now suﬃces to prove that ψ is surjective.

dimq(eWνe) = dimq(Wν1 ⊗ Wν2).

Rename the generators of Q as follows. Put

ci+1 =( sm1 ··· s1s0s1 ··· sm1

si

i = m1
i 6= m1

so that Q is generated by {c1, c2, . . . , cm1+m2}. Deﬁne ℓQ : Q −→ N0 in the following way. For the
identity element 1 ∈ Q put ℓQ(1) = 0. Any w ∈ Q can be written as a product w = ci1 ··· cik . Pick
these generators in such a way that k is minimal. Then ℓQ(w) = k. For example, ℓQ(ci) = 1 for every
i. We say that w = ci1 ··· cik ∈ Q is an ℓQ-reduced expression for w if ℓQ(w) = k.

Let ℓ : W B
m . The isomorphism φ from Lemma 2.5
demonstrates that any ℓQ-reduced expression ci1 ··· cik is also a reduced expression with respect to ℓ.

It is clear that ψ is surjective on elements e(ij) and xie(ij), for all i ∈ θI ν1, j ∈ θJ ν2. Notice that

ψ(σke(i) ⊗ e(j)) = σck+1e(ij)
ψ(e(i) ⊗ σke(j)) = σcm1+k+1e(ij)

for 0 ≤ k ≤ m1 − 1

for 0 ≤ k ≤ m2 − 1.

e(ij). Then e is full in the separated VV algebra Wν.

Therefore ψ is surjective on the basis B′ and hence on eWν1+ν2e.
Lemma 2.7. Let e =Pi∈θI ν1
Proof. We must show Wν = Wν eWν. We take any idempotent e(k) ∈ Wν, not a summand of e, and
show that e(k) ∈ WνeWν. Suppose k1 = i ∈ I (the same argument holds if k1 = j ∈ J). Let ε1, . . . , εr
denote the positions of entries belonging to I, and assume ε1 < ··· < εr. Since k1 = i ∈ I, we have
ε1 = 1. Let w1 = s2s3s4 ··· sε2−1 ∈ Sm, where the sj are the generators of Sm. Then,

j∈θJ ν2

because σ2

r e(i) = e(i) when there are no arrows between ir and ir+1.

σρ
w1σw1e(k) = e(k)

Suppose σw1e(k) = e(k1)σw1. Then the ﬁrst two entries of k1 are elements of I. Let w2 = s3s4s5 ··· sε3−1 ∈
Sm. Then,

σρ
w2σw2e(k1) = e(k1)

for the same reasoning as above. Suppose σw2e(k1) = e(k2)σw2. Then the ﬁrst three entries of k2 are
elements of I.

Continuing like this we obtain σw2, . . . , σwr−1 with σρ
Then we have,

wtσwte(kt−1) = e(kt−1), for t with 2 ≤ t ≤ r − 1.

σρ
w1σρ

w2 ··· σρ

wr−1e(ij)σwr−1 ··· σw2σw1e(k) = e(k),

and e(ij) is a summand of e. Hence e(k) ∈ Wν eWν so that Wν = Wν eWν , as required.
Corollary 2.8. Wν and Wν1 ⊗k Wν2 are Morita equivalent.
Proof. Using Lemma 2.7, we have that Wνe is a progenerator in Wν-Mod. To show Morita equiv-
alence it remains to show EndWν (Wν e) ∼= Wν1 ⊗ Wν2. But, by Proposition 2.6 and the fact that
EndWν (Wνe) ∼= eWνe, we are done.

(cid:3)

(cid:3)

Remark 2.9. In this section we have deﬁned families of VV algebras arising from unions of Z ⋊ Z2-
orbits. But in fact Corollary 2.8 shows that in order to study these VV algebras it suﬃces to study
the families of VV algebras arising from a single Z ⋊ Z2-orbit, as we deﬁned in Section 1.4. A slightly
modiﬁed version of this theorem, using the same proof, explains why we may assume that ν has
connected support.

2.2. Morita Equivalence in the Case p, q 6∈ I. In this section we assume p, q 6∈ I. Then I = Iλ is
the Z ⋊ Z2-orbit of λ ∈ k×, for some λ 6= p, q.

The deﬁning relations of Wν are dependent on whether or not q is an element of I.
in this case, for every idempotent e(i), we have

In particular,

π2e(i) = e(i)

πσ1πσ1e(i) = σ1πσ1πe(i)

deg(πe(i)) = 0

For any VV algebra Wν we can consider various idempotent subalgebras eWνe, for diﬀerent choices
of e. Each of these idempotent subalgebras may or may not be isomorphic to a KLR algebra (see
Proposition 1.17). Among these KLR algebras we can always distinguish R+
˜ν , as mentioned in
Remark 1.19. Here we show that the VV algebras arising from the setting p, q 6∈ I are Morita equivalent
to KLR algebras of type A. Namely, for any ν ∈ θNI, Wν and R+
˜ν are Morita equivalent, as are Wν
and R−
˜ν . Let |ν| = 2m. Again, we are using the notation as in Remark
1.13. To stress this point; for ν =Pi∈I + νii +Pi∈I − νii we set ˜ν =Pi∈I + νii ∈ NI +.

˜ν . We show this here for R+

˜ν and R−

Theorem 2.10. Wν and R+

˜ν are Morita equivalent.

Proof. It suﬃces to ﬁnd a progenerator P ∈ Wν-Mod such that R+

˜ν ∼= EndWν (P ).

Let

Now, Wνe is a progenerator if and only e is full in Wν, i.e. if and only if Wν eWν = Wν.

e(i)

e := Xi∈I ˜ν

Clearly Wν eWν ⊆ Wν. So it remains to show Wν ⊆ WνeWν. We do this by showing that every
idempotent e(i) lies in WνeWν. Then, since Pi∈θI ν e(i) = 1, it follows that 1 ∈ Wν eWν and so
WνeWν ⊆ Wν .
If e(i) is a summand of e then it is clear that e(i) ∈ WνeWν. Take e(i) ∈ Wν not a summand of
e. Then there are ﬁnitely many entries of i, say ik1, . . . , ikr , with iks ∈ I − for all 1 ≤ s ≤ r, and with
k1 < k2 < ··· < kr. Let η be the minimal length left coset representative of Sm in W B

m given by

Fix this reduced expression of η. Fix the reduced expression

η = sk1−1 ··· s1s0 ··· ··· skr−1−1 ··· s1s0skr−1 ··· s1s0

η−1 = s0s1 ··· skr−1s0s1 ··· skr−1−1 ··· ··· s0s1 ··· sk1−1.

Then e(i)ση = σηe(j) for some e(j), where j ∈ I ˜ν so that e(j) is a summand of e, and

σηe(j)ση−1 = e(i).

Hence e(i) ∈ WνeWν as required. It follows now that e is full in Wν so that Wνe is a progenerator in
Wν-Mod.

A Note on the Cases: p ∈ I, q ∈ I.
Case: q ∈ I. Consider ﬁrst the case q ∈ I, p 6∈ I. Take ν ∈ θNIq and consider the associated VV
algebra Wν. Note that many of the relations now depend on whether or not i1 = q±1. If we pick ν so
that q is not a summand then of course we always have i1 6= q±1. Hence, in this case, the relations are
exactly the same as those in the ME setting so that Wν is Morita equivalent to R+
˜ν . From now on,
when we work in the setting q ∈ I, we assume q (and hence q−1) is a summand of ν. That is, νq ≥ 1.
Case: p ∈ I. Now consider the case p ∈ I, q 6∈ I. Take ν ∈ θNIp and the associated VV algebra Wν.
The deﬁning relations do not explicitly depend on whether or not p ∈ I, but the subtle diﬀerence arises
when we examine the underlying quiver ΓIp. Locally, with regards to the relations, ΓIp is exactly the
same as ΓIλ, for some λ 6= p, q, except in the following neighbourhood of ΓIp.

with νp ≤ 1 the deﬁning relations of Wν are exactly those in the ME setting. So again, in this case,
Wν and R+
˜ν are Morita equivalent. From now on, when we work in the setting p ∈ I, we assume νp ≥ 2
(and hence νp−1 ≥ 2).
2.3. Morita Equivalences in the Case q ∈ I. For the remainder of this section, unless stated
otherwise, we assume that p is not a root of unity.

2.3.1. Aﬃne Cellularity of Classes of VV Algebras. Graham and Lehrer deﬁned the notion of cellularity
for ﬁnite-dimensional algebras in [GL96]. They deﬁned these algebras in terms of a basis satisfying
various combinatorial properties. Showing that an algebra is cellular gives rise to a parametrisation of
its irreducible modules. The notion of aﬃne cellularity was introduced by Koenig and Xi in [KX12],
and extends the notion of cellularity to algebras which need not be ﬁnite-dimensional.

Deﬁnition 2.11. A k-involution of a k-algebra A is a k-linear anti-automorphism ω with ω2 = idA.

By an aﬃne algebra we mean a commutative k-algebra B which is a quotient of a polynomial ring
k[x1, . . . , xn] in ﬁnitely many variables.

Deﬁnition 2.12 ([KX12], Deﬁnition 2.1). Let A be a unitary k-algebra with a k-involution ω on A.
A two-sided ideal J ⊆ A is called an aﬃne cell ideal if and only if the following data are given and
the following conditions are satisﬁed.

(1) ω(J) = J.
(2) There exists a free k-module V of ﬁnite rank and an aﬃne commutative k-algebra B with identity
and with a k-involution i such that ∆ := V ⊗k B is an A-B-bimodule, where the right B-module
structure is induced by that of the right regular B-module.

ON MORITA EQUIVALENCES BETWEEN KLR ALGEBRAS AND VV ALGEBRAS

17

(3) There is an A-A-bimodule isomorphism α : J −→ ∆⊗B ∆′, where ∆′ = B ⊗k V is a B-A-bimodule
with the left B-structure induced by the left regular B-module. The right A-structure is induced
via ω. That is,

(b ⊗ v)a := s(ω(a)(v ⊗ b)) for a ∈ A, b ∈ B, v ∈ V

where s : V ⊗ B −→ B ⊗ V , v ⊗ b 7→ b ⊗ v is the switch map, such that the following diagram

cellular if there is a k-module decomposition A = J ′
j for each

n, for some n, with ω(J ′

j ) = J ′

j ∼= Jj/Jj−1 is an aﬃne cell ideal of A/Jj−1 (with respect to the involution
and for each j the quotient J ′
induced by ω on the quotient). This chain is called a cell chain for the aﬃne cellular algebra A. The
module ∆ is called a cell lattice for the aﬃne cell ideal J.

Remark 2.14. In [Kle15], Kleshchev gives graded versions of Deﬁnitions 2.12 and 2.13 in which all
algebras, ideals, etc. are graded and the maps ω, i are homogeneous.

In this Section we ﬁx the following setting. Assume q ∈ I, p 6∈ I, p not a root of unity and take

The next lemma states that every idempotent e(i) ∈ Wν is isomorphic to either an idempotent in
˜ν or to an idempotent in R−
R+
˜ν .
Lemma 2.15. Take e(i) ∈ Wν with i /∈ I ˜ν+ ∪ I ˜ν−
entry in i.

. Note that precisely one of q, q−1 will appear as an

(i) If q is in position k (i.e. ik = q) then e(i) ∼= e(j) for some j ∈ I ˜ν+
(ii) If q−1 is in position k (i.e. ik = q−1) then e(i) ∼= e(j) for some j ∈ I ˜ν−

.

.

Proof. For (i), assume q is in position k, i.e. ik = q. We require a ∈ e(i)Wν e(j), b ∈ e(j)Wν e(i) such
that ab = e(i) and ba = e(j), for some j ∈ I ˜ν+

.

∪ I ˜ν−

Since i /∈ I ˜ν+
there is a non-empty subset {ε1, . . . , εd} ( {1, . . . , m}, with εr < εr+1 for all
r, such that iεr = p2nr q−1, where nr ∈ Z \ {0} for all r. Note also that εr 6= k for all r since ik = q.
Put,

a = e(i)σε1−1 ··· σ1πσε2−1 ··· σ1π ··· σεd−1 ··· σ1πe(j) ∈ e(i)Wνe(j)
b = e(j)πσ1 ··· σεd−1πσ1 ··· σεd−1−1 ··· πσ1 ··· σε1−1e(i) ∈ e(j)Wν e(i).

and, from the relations, we know that ab = e(i) and ba = e(j) so

(cid:3)

Then e(j) ∈ Wν is such that j ∈ I ˜ν+
that e(i) ∼= e(j). A similar argument is used for (ii) when ik = q−1.
Corollary 2.16. Every idempotent e(i) ∈ Wν is isomorphic to some e(jλ), λ ∈ Π±.
Proof. By Lemma 2.15, it suﬃces to prove that every e(i), with i ∈ I ˜ν+
to some e(jλ), λ ∈ Π±. Suppose i ∈ I ˜ν+
|˜ν+| = m.

(the proof for when i ∈ I ˜ν−

or with i ∈ I ˜ν−

, is isomorphic
is the same). Let |ν| = 2m so that

Take any i ∈ I ˜ν+

if p2j−2q appears before p2jq in i
if p2j−2q appears after p2jq in i.

Then there exists a surjection,

g : I ˜ν+

։ Π(m)
i 7→ (a1, . . . , am).

We have seen already from 2.1 that there is a one-to-one correspondence between Π(m) and root
partitions associated to ˜ν. Now, g(i) ∈ Π(m) and therefore corresponds to some root partition λ ∈ Π+,
i.e. g(i) = θ(λ). This means we have e(i) ∼= e(iλ), because when we permute entries of i which do not
aﬀect g(i), we are permuting entries of i in such a way that neighbouring vertices of ΓI never switch
position, by deﬁnition. Hence we can permute entries of i in this way to obtain a root partition, e(iλ).
In other words, there exists an element w ∈ Sm such that σρ

Corollary 2.17. The idempotent e =Pλ∈Π± e(iλ) is full in Wν.
Proof. It is clear that Wν eWν ⊆ Wν. To show Wν ⊆ WνeWν it suﬃces to show e(i) ∈ WνeWν,
for every idempotent e(i) not a summand of e. Let e(i) be such an idempotent. By Corollary 2.16,

we(iλ)σwe(i) = e(i).

e(i) ∼= e(iλ) for some λ ∈ Π±. That is, there exists a ∈ e(i)Wνe(iλ), b ∈ e(iλ)Wνe(i) such that

e(i) = ab = ae(iλ)b ∈ Wν eWν .

Then Wν = WνeWν as required.

A and ˜A are graded k-algebras via

deg(ujej) = deg(vjaj) = 1

for i, j ∈ {1, 2}.
Theorem 2.18. Wν and A⊗(m−1) ⊗ ˜A are Morita equivalent.
Proof. Deﬁne a map

as follows.

and θ(λ) = (j1, . . . , jm−1).

Extend this map k-linearly and multiplicatively. Since φ is deﬁned on the generators of A⊗(m−1) ⊗ ˜A,
and the commutativity of elements in each tensor factor is preserved, the map φ is well-deﬁned and is
an algebra morphism.

We claim that φ is an isomorphism of k-algebras. We ﬁrst check surjectivity. Since there is a bi-
jection between Π(m) and Π+ we have that φ is surjective on idempotents e(iλ). The map φ is also
surjective on elements e(iλ′ )σwe(iλ), w ∈ W B

It remains to check surjectivity on the xje(iλ), 1 ≤ j ≤ m.

Take any λ ∈ Π± with θ(λ) = (j1, . . . , jm−1). For an entry a ∈ iλ let ψ(a) denote its position in
iλ. Let us assume that q is an entry of iλ since the same argument holds when q−1 is an entry of iλ.
Then

Now consider xje(iλ), for any j 6= ψ(q). Let ij be the jth entry of iλ. Note that

φ(ej1 ⊗ ··· ⊗ ejm−1 ⊗ π2ai) = xψ(q)e(iλ).

where k = ψ(p−2ij) is the position of p−2ij in iλ.

xje(iλ) = (xj − xk + xk)e(iλ)

But note that

(xj − xk)e(iλ) = σρ

for some w ∈ Sm, where λ′ ∈ Π± is the root partition in which simple roots appear in the same order

and θ(λ′) = (j1, . . . , j′

k, . . . jm−1) for some 1 ≤ k ≤ m − 1. We can repeat this until we get

xje(iλ) = (xj − xk + xk − ··· − xℓ + xℓ)e(iλ)

where ℓ = ψ(q). So xje(iλ) = (σρ
e(iλ′)σwe(iλ) we have φ surjective on the xje(iλ).

We complete the proof by comparing the graded dimensions of A⊗(m−1) ⊗ ˜A and eWνe and show-
ing that they are equal.

Consider ﬁrst the graded dimension of A. There are two elements in degree 0: e1 and e2. There
are two elements in degree 1: u1e1 and u2e2.
Indeed we have two elements in each degree and so
dimqA = 2 + 2q + 2q2 + 2q3 + ··· = 2

dimq(A⊗(m−1) ⊗ ˜A) =

First we show that φ is degree-preserving. This is clear on idempotents and xke(iλ). Now take
e(iλ′ )σwe(iλ), for some w ∈ W B
m .

• Suppose ﬁrst that λ, λ′ both lie either in Π+ or in Π−. Then w = s ∈ Sm. Let s = si1 ··· sik
be the ﬁxed reduced expression for s so that σse(iλ) = σi1 ··· σik e(iλ). Now, deg(σij e(i)) is 1 if
σij swaps ij and p±2ij, and is 0 otherwise. Then deg(σse(iλ)) is the number of pairs (ij , p±2ij)
in e(iλ) which appear in the opposite order in e(iλ′). Letting (a1, . . . , am−1)λ, (a1, . . . , am−1)λ′
be the elements of Π(m) corresponding to λ, λ′ ∈ Π± respectively, we ﬁnd deg(σse(iλ)) is the
number of entries in (a1, . . . , am−1)λ diﬀerent to entries in (a1, . . . , am−1)λ′, i.e. the number of
uℓ appearing as tensorands in φ−1(e(iλ′ )σwe(iλ)).

• Now suppose one of λ, λ′ lies in Π+ and the other in Π−. Then w = ηs, where s ∈ Sm
and η ∈ D(W B
m /Sm) is the longest element, and σwe(iλ) = σησse(iλ). Since we always have
deg(σηe(iλ)) = 1 it follows that deg(e(iλ′ )σwe(iλ)) = deg(σηe(iλ′′ )) + deg(σse(iλ)) = 1 +
deg(σse(iλ)), for some root partition λ

.

′′

Hence deg(e(iλ′ )σwe(iλ)) = #{uj, vk appearing in φ−1(σwe(iλ))} and so φ is degree-preserving.

This means we have a bijection

{e(iλ′ )σwe(iλ) | λ′, λ ∈ Π±} ←→ {γ1 ⊗ ··· ⊗ γm ∈ A⊗(m−1) ⊗ ˜A | deg γi ≤ 1 ∀i}.

Put A := A⊗(m−1) ⊗ ˜A and let Adeg≤1 be the vector space hγ1 ⊗ ··· ⊗ γm | degγi ≤ 1i. Each tensorand
has two elements in each degree. Then the graded dimension of Adeg≤1 has a factor of 2m. In each
degree k we choose k tensorands from a possible m. There are 2m(cid:0)m
0(cid:1) elements in degree 0. There are
2m(cid:0)m
k(cid:1) elements.
k(cid:19)qk = 2m(1 + q)m =Xλ,λ′

and hence dimq(eWνe) = dimq(A⊗(m−1) ⊗ ˜A) so that eWνe ∼= A⊗(m−1) ⊗ ˜A. This, together with the
fact that e is full in Wν by Corollary 2.17, proves Morita equivalence between Wν and A⊗(m−1)⊗ ˜A. (cid:3)
We compare this result to a result of Brundan and Kleshchev. Pick ˜ν ∈ NI, with multiplicity one, and
|˜ν| = m. Let R˜ν be the corresponding KLR algebra.
Theorem 2.20 ([Bru13], Theorem 3.13). R˜ν and A⊗(m−1) ⊗k k[x] are Morita equivalent.
2.3.2. Aﬃne Quasi-Heredity. The notion of quasi-heredity for ﬁnite-dimensional algebras was ﬁrst de-
ﬁned by Cline, Parshall and Scott in 1987. The motivating reasons came from the study of highest
weight categories arising in the representation theory of semisimple complex Lie algebras and algebraic
groups.
In 2014, Kleshchev introduced aﬃne quasi-heredity and the deﬁnition of an aﬃne highest
weight category, see [Kle15]. In particular, he proved an aﬃne analogue of the Cline-Parshall-Scott

22

RUARI WALKER

Theorem; an algebra A is aﬃne quasi-hereditary if and only if the category A-mod of ﬁnitely generated
graded A-modules is an aﬃne highest weight category. In [Kle15], Kleshchev deﬁnes these notions in a
more general setting, but for our purposes we take B to be the class of all positively graded polynomial
algebras. The deﬁnitions that follow are taken from [Kle15].

Deﬁnition 2.21. A graded vector space V is called Laurentian if it is locally ﬁnite-dimensional and
bounded below. A graded algebra A is Laurentian if it is Laurentian as a graded vector space.

Lemma 2.22 ([Kle], Lemma 2.2). Let H be a Laurentian algebra. Then,

(i) All irreducible H-modules are ﬁnite-dimensional.
(ii) H is semiperfect (every ﬁnitely generated (graded) H-module has a (graded) projective cover);
in particular, there are ﬁnitely many irreducible H-modules up to isomorphism and degree shift.

Deﬁnition 2.23. Let A be a Noetherian Laurentian graded k-algebra. A is said to be connected if
An = 0 for all n < 0 and A0 = k · 1.
For example, all algebras in B are connected.

For a left Noetherian Laurentian algebra A let

{L(π) | π ∈ Π}

be a complete irredundant set of simple A-modules up to isomorphism and degree shift. For each
π ∈ Π, let P (π) be the projective cover of L(π). That is, P (π) is a projective A-module and there
is a surjection θ : P (π) ։ L(π) with ker(θ) negligible, i.e. whenever N ⊂ P (π) is a submodule with
N + ker(θ) = P (π), then N = P (π).

We let q be both a formal variable and also a degree shift functor. If V =Ln∈Z Vn then (qV )n = Vn−1.

For the remainder of this section all algebras will be Noetherian, Laurentian and graded and we will
only consider ﬁnitely generated modules over these algebras.

Deﬁnition 2.24. A two-sided ideal J ⊆ A is an aﬃne heredity ideal if
(SI1) HomA(J, A/J) = 0.
(SI2) As a left module, J ∼= m(q)P (π) for some graded multiplicity m(q) ∈ Z[q, q−1] and some π ∈ Π,

such that Bπ := EndA(P (π))op ∈ B.

(PSI) As a right Bπ-module, P (π) is ﬁnitely generated and ﬂat.

Remark 2.25. For a connected algebra, a ﬁnitely generated module is ﬂat if and only if it is free. For
Bπ connected, the (PSI) condition can be reformulated: as a right Bπ-module, P (π) is free ﬁnite rank.

Lemma 2.26 ([Kle15], Lemma 6.5). Let J be an ideal in the algebra A such that the left A-module AJ
is projective. Then the condition (SI1) is equivalent to the condition J 2 = J, which in turn is equivalent
to J = AeA for an idempotent e ∈ A.
Lemma 2.27 ([Kle15], Lemma 6.6). Let J ⊆ A be an aﬃne heredity ideal. Write J = AeA for an
idempotent e, according to Lemma 2.26. Then the natural map Ae ⊗eAe eA −→ J is an isomorphism.
Moreover, we may choose an idempotent e to be primitive so that, using the notation of Deﬁnition 2.24,
we have Ae ∼= P (π) and Bπ ∼= eAe.

Deﬁnition 2.28. An algebra A is aﬃne quasi-hereditary if there exists a ﬁnite chain of ideals

with Ji+1/Ji an aﬃne heredity ideal in A/Ji, for all 0 ≤ i < n. Such a chain of ideals is called an aﬃne
heredity chain.

(0) = J0 ( J1 ( ··· ( Jn = A

Proposition 2.29. If A and B are two aﬃne quasi-hereditary k-algebras then the tensor product A⊗kB
is aﬃne quasi-hereditary.

Proof. Let,

(2.2)

(0) = A0 ⊂ A1 ⊂ ··· ⊂ An = A
(0) = B0 ⊂ B1 ⊂ ··· ⊂ Bm = B
be aﬃne heredity chains for A and B, respectively. We claim that

(0) ⊂ A1 ⊗ B1 ⊂ A1 ⊗ B2 ⊂ ··· ⊂ A1 ⊗ B ⊂ A2 ⊗ B1 + A1 ⊗ B ⊂ A2 ⊗ B2 + A1 ⊗ B ⊂ ··· ⊂ A ⊗ B
is an aﬃne heredity chain. We ﬁx m ≥ 1 and proceed by induction on n.

When n = 1, A has aﬃne heredity chain (0) = A0 ⊂ A1 = A and we claim that A ⊗ B has aﬃne
heredity chain,

(0) ⊂ A ⊗ B1 ⊂ A ⊗ B2 ⊂ ··· ⊂ A ⊗ Bm = A ⊗ B.

We must show that each (A⊗ Bi)/(A⊗ Bi−1) ⊂ (A⊗ B)/(A⊗ Bi−1), for 1 ≤ i ≤ m, is an aﬃne heredity
ideal. Note that, (A⊗ Bi)/(A⊗ Bi−1) ∼= A⊗ Bi/Bi−1 and (A⊗ B)/(A⊗ Bi−1) ∼= A⊗ B/Bi−1. Since A
and Bi/Bi−1 are both idempotent ideals, we know that A ⊗ Bi/Bi−1 is an idempotent ideal. Then, by
Lemma 2.26, to show (SI1) it suﬃces to show that A⊗Bi/Bi−1 is projective as a left A⊗B/Bi−1-module.
Since A ⊂ A is an aﬃne heredity ideal we have A ∼= m(q)P (π) ∈ A-proj, for some graded multi-
plicity m(q) ∈ Z[q, q−1], such that Bπ := End(P (π))op ∈ B. By Lemma 2.27, P (π) ∼= Ae for some
idempotent e ∈ A. Then we have Bπ ∼= eAe ∈ B.
Similarly, since Bi/Bi−1 ⊂ B/Bi−1 is an aﬃne heredity ideal we have Bi/Bi−1 ∼= n(q)Q(σ) ∈ B/Bi−1-
proj, for some graded multiplicity n(q) ∈ Z[q, q−1], such that Bσ := End(Q(σ))op ∈ B. Again by
Lemma 2.27, Q(σ) ∼= B/Bi−1f for some idempotent f ∈ B/Bi−1. Then we have Bσ ∼= f B/Bi−1f ∈ B.
Hence, A ⊗ Bi/Bi−1 ∼= m(q)n(q) · P (π) ⊗ Q(σ) ∈ A ⊗ B/Bi−1-proj, so that (SI1) holds. Moreover,

P (π) ⊗ Q(σ) ∼= Ae ⊗ B/Bi−1f = A ⊗ B/Bi−1 · e ⊗ f .

So Bπ,σ := EndA⊗B/Bi−1 (A ⊗ B/Bi−1 · e ⊗ f )op ∼= eAe ⊗ f B/Bi−1f ∈ B, so (SI2) also holds. We have
so far shown that (SI1) and (SI2) hold. It remains to show (PSI). We know that P (π) is free ﬁnite rank
as a right Bπ-module and that Q(σ) is free ﬁnite rank as a right Bσ-module. That is, P (π) ∼= (eAe)k
and Q(σ) ∼= (f B/Bi−1f )l, for some k, l ∈ N. Hence,

P (π) ⊗ Q(σ) ∼= (eAe ⊗ f B/Bi−1f )kl.

24

RUARI WALKER

Then, as a right Bπ,σ-module, P (π) ⊗ Q(σ) is free ﬁnite rank and the statement of the theorem holds
for n = 1.

Suppose now that the result holds whenever A has an aﬃne heredity chain of length k < n. Then
let A and B be aﬃne quasi-hereditary with aﬃne heredity chains 2.2. One can easily verify that

(0) ⊂ A2/A1 ⊂ ··· ⊂ An/A1 = A/A1

is an aﬃne heredity chain. It is a chain of length n−1 < n so, using induction, the statement of the the-
orem holds for (A/A1)⊗B. Hence it suﬃces to prove that (A1⊗Bi)/(A1⊗Bi−1) ⊂ (A⊗B)/(A1⊗Bi−1),
for 1 ≤ i ≤ m, is an aﬃne heredity ideal. Note that (A1 ⊗ Bi)/(A1 ⊗ Bi−1) ∼= A1 ⊗ (Bi/Bi−1).

A1 and Bi/Bi−1 are both idempotent ideals so that A1 ⊗ Bi/Bi−1 is an idempotent ideal. Then,
by Lemma 2.26, to show (SI1) it suﬃces to show that A1 ⊗ Bi/Bi−1 is a projective A ⊗ B/A1 ⊗ Bi−1-
module. Firstly, note that A1 ⊗ (B/Bi−1) ∈ (A ⊗ B)/(A1 ⊗ Bi−1)-proj because
A1 ⊗ (B/Bi−1) ∼= ((A ⊗ B)/(A1 ⊗ Bi−1)) ⊗A⊗B A1 ⊗ B

and, since A1 ⊗ B ∈ A ⊗ B-proj,
(A ⊗ B)/(A1 ⊗ Bi−1)-module. Then (SI1) is satisﬁed. We now show (SI2) holds.

it follows that A1 ⊗ (B/Bi−1) is a direct summand of a free

Note ﬁrst that A1 ⊂ A is an aﬃne heredity ideal. So

A1 ∼= m(q)P (π) ∼= m(q)Ae,

for some π ∈ Π, graded multiplicity m(q) ∈ Z[q, q−1], and e ∈ A a primitive idempotent, where we have
used Lemma 2.27, for the second isomorphism. Similarly, Bi/Bi−1 ⊂ B/Bi−1 is an aﬃne heredity ideal
so

for some σ ∈ Σ, graded multiplicity n(q) ∈ Z[q, q−1], and f = f + Bi−1 a primitive idempotent, again
using Lemma 2.27, for the second isomorphism. Then,

Bi/Bi−1 ∼= n(q)Q(σ) ∼= n(q)B/Bi−1 · f ,

A1 ⊗ Bi/Bi−1 ∼= m(q)n(q)P (π) ⊗ Q(σ)

∼= m(q)n(q)A ⊗ B/Bi−1 · (e ⊗ f ) ∈ (A ⊗ B)/(A ⊗ Bi−1)−proj,

and is the projective cover of a simple A ⊗ (B/Bi)-module. However, we need these facts for (A ⊗
B)/(A1 ⊗ Bi−1). There is a short exact sequence of A ⊗ B-bimodules,

0 −→ ker(g) −→ (A ⊗ B)/(A1 ⊗ Bi−1)

−→ (A ⊗ B)/(A ⊗ Bi−1) −→ 0,

g

where ker(g) ∼= (A ⊗ Bi−1)/(A1 ⊗ Bi−1) ∼= (A/A1) ⊗ Bi−1. So the short exact sequence is
−→ (A ⊗ B)/(A ⊗ Bi−1) −→ 0.

0 −→ (A/A1) ⊗ Bi−1 −→ (A ⊗ B)/(A1 ⊗ Bi−1)

g

We now apply the functor − ⊗A⊗B (Ae ⊗ Bf ), which we know to be right exact. But (A/A1) ⊗ Bi−1
vanishes under this functor, since Ae ⊂ A1. This means we obtain an isomorphism,
(A ⊗ B)/(A1 ⊗ Bi−1) · (e ⊗ f ) ∼= (A ⊗ B)/(A ⊗ Bi−1) · (e ⊗ f ).

ON MORITA EQUIVALENCES BETWEEN KLR ALGEBRAS AND VV ALGEBRAS

25

So,

A1 ⊗ (Bi/Bi−1) ∼= m(q)n(q)(A ⊗ B)/(A1 ⊗ Bi−1) · (e ⊗ f )
= m(q)n(q)(A ⊗ B)/(A1 ⊗ Bi−1) · (e ⊗ f ),

which is the projective cover of a simple (A ⊗ B)/(A1 ⊗ Bi−1)-module. Let P (π, σ) := (A ⊗ B)/(A1 ⊗
Bi−1) · (e ⊗ f ). For (SI2) it remains to check that Bπ,σ := End(P (π, σ))op ∈ B.

Bπ,σ := End(P (π, σ))op ∼= (e ⊗ f ) · (A ⊗ B)/(A1 ⊗ Bi−1) · (e ⊗ f )
∼= (e ⊗ f ) · (A ⊗ B)/(A ⊗ Bi−1) · (e ⊗ f )
∼= eAe ⊗ f (B/Bi−1)f ∈ B,
since eAe, f (B/Bi−1)f ∈ B. This proves (SI2). We now show (PSI).

Ae is free ﬁnite rank as a right eAe-module, i.e. Ae ∼= (eAe)k. Similarly, B/Bi−1f is free ﬁnite
rank as a right f (B/Bi−1)f -module, i.e. (B/Bi−1)f ∼= (f (B/Bi−1)f )l. This implies,

A ⊗ (B/Bi−1)(e ⊗ f ) ∼= (eAe ⊗ f (B/Bi−1)f )kl.

This proves (PSI) so that (A1 ⊗ Bi)/(A1 ⊗ Bi−1) ⊂ (A ⊗ B)/(A1 ⊗ Bi−1), for 1 ≤ i ≤ m, is an aﬃne
heredity ideal. Thus, using induction, we have shown that A ⊗ B is aﬃne quasi-hereditary.
Let A be the path algebra of the following quiver, as in 2.3.1.

(cid:3)

e1

u1

u2

e2

A is a graded algebra with deg(ei) = 0, deg(uiei) = 1, for i ∈ {1, 2}. In this case, Π = {1, 2}. There are
two simple graded modules denoted L(1) and L(2), with projective covers P (1) = Ae1 and P (2) = Ae2,
respectively. As a k-vector space, A = Ln∈Z≥0
An, where An is the subspace of A spanned by the
two degree n elements. So A is a Laurentian algebra. Consider Ae1 as a left A-module. Since it is a
uniserial module, every submodule is ﬁnitely generated and so Ae1 is left Noetherian. Similarly, Ae2 is
left Noetherian. Hence A = Ae1 ⊕ Ae2 is left Noetherian, using the fact that the direct sum of two left
Noetherian modules is again left Noetherian.

Proposition 2.30. A is aﬃne quasi-hereditary.

Proof. Consider the following chain of ideals

We ﬁrst take Ae1A ( A and show it is an aﬃne heredity ideal.
(SI1) As a k-vector space A/Ae1A = he2i. We have HomA(Ae1A, A/Ae1A) = 0;

for any f ∈

HomA(Ae1A, A/Ae1A) and any a1, a2 ∈ A, f (a1e1a2) = a1e1f (e1a2) = 0, so that HomA(Ae1A, A/Ae1A) =
0.

(SI2) We have Ae1A ⊆ Ae1 + Au2e2. But clearly Ae1 + Au2e2 ⊆ Ae1A and so Ae1A = Ae1 + Au2e2.

Since Ae1 ∩ Au2e2 = {0}, we have Ae1A = Ae1 ⊕ Au2e2. So m1(q) = 1 + q and P (1) = Ae1.

P (1) = Ae1 so B1 = EndA(Ae1)op ∼= e1Ae1 ∼= k[x], a polynomial algebra. So indeed we
have B1 ∈ B.
(PSI) As a right e1Ae1-module, Ae1 = e1 · e1Ae1 + u1e1 · e1Ae1 and so is ﬁnitely generated. Also,
e1 · e1Ae1 ∩ u1e1 · e1Ae1 = {0}. Then, Ae1 =L{e1,u1e1} e1Ae1 as a right e1Ae1-module and so

is projective, which implies Ae1 is ﬂat.

This shows that Ae1A is an aﬃne heredity ideal in A. It remains to show that A/Ae1A is an aﬃne
heredity ideal in A/Ae1A. But this is immediate: for any ring R, HomR(R, R/R) = 0 so that (SI1) is
satisﬁed. A/Ae1A has one simple module with Π = {2}. In fact, since

A/Ae1A ∼= k

we have that the regular representation A/Ae1A is a simple A/Ae1A-module with projective cover
P (2) = A/Ae1A. So m2(q) = 1. Also, EndA/Ae1A(A/Ae1A)op ∼= A/Ae1A ∼= k which lies in B so (SI2)
is satisﬁed. Since A/Ae1A = ke2 = e2k, A/Ae1A is ﬁnitely generated as a right k-module and clearly
A/Ae1A is ﬂat.

Then (0) ( Ae1A ( A is an aﬃne heredity chain and hence A is aﬃne quasi-hereditary as claimed. (cid:3)

Combining Proposition 2.29 with Proposition 2.30 we obtain the following Corollary.

Corollary 2.31. The k-algebras A⊗(m−1) ⊗k ˜A, m ∈ N are aﬃne quasi-hereditary.
Corollary 2.32. For any ν ∈ θNIq with multiplicity one the VV algebras Wν are aﬃne quasi-hereditary.
Proof. Kleshchev proves, in [Kle15], Theorem 6.7, that an algebra R is aﬃne quasi-hereditary if and only
if R-Mod satisﬁes certain properties, in which case he calls R-Mod an aﬃne highest weight category.
This characterisation of aﬃne quasi-heredity is purely categorical, meaning that aﬃne quasi-heredity is
a Morita invariant property. Morita equivalence between A⊗(m−1)⊗ ˜A and Wν, together with Corollary
2.31, proves the claim.

(cid:3)

Corollary 2.33. Suppose now that p, q 6∈ I. For any ν ∈ θNI the VV algebras Wν are aﬃne quasi-
hereditary.

Proof. Using Theorem 2.10 together with the fact that the algebras R˜ν are aﬃne quasi-hereditary,
when p is not a root of unity, (see [Kle15], Section 10.1) immediately gives the result.

2.3.3. Balanced Involution. Let A be a left Noetherian Laurentian algebra and let τ : A −→ A be a
homogeneous anti-involution on A. That is, τ is an anti-automorphism of A such that τ 2 = idA. Given
a left A-module M ∈ A-Mod, we can deﬁne a right A-module M τ via ma := τ (a)m. Given a graded
module M ∈ A-Mod with ﬁnite-dimensional graded components Mn we can deﬁne its graded dual
M ⊛ ∈ A-Mod. As a graded vector space, M ⊛
−n for all n ∈ Z, and the action is given by af (m) :=
f (τ (a)m), for f ∈ M ⊛, m ∈ M and a ∈ A. Note that (qnV )⊛ ∼= q−nV ⊛ and dimqV ⊛ =dimq−1V .

n := M ∗

Deﬁnition 2.34. The homogeneous anti-involution τ of A is called a balanced involution if, for

every π ∈ Π, we have that L(π)⊛ ∼= qnL(π) for some even integer n.

As before, let A be the path algebra A = k(e1 ⇄ e2). Deﬁne the following algebra morphism on A.

for i = 1, 2

τ : A −→ A
ei 7→ ei
u1 7→ u2
u2 7→ u1.

The map τ is an anti-involution on A. Now consider L(π)⊛ for π = 1.

L(1)⊛

n = L(1)∗

−n =( Hom(L(1), k)

0

if n = 0
if n 6= 0.

As a k-vector space Hom(L(1), k) = hfi where f (e1) = 1. Hom(L(1), k) is an A-module with the action
given by (af )(m) = f (τ (a)m), for all a ∈ A and m ∈ L(1). Then, (e1f )(e1) = f (e1) so that e1f = f .
(e2f )(e1) = f (e2e1) = 0 so e2f = 0. Similarly, u1f = 0 = u2f . Then Hom(L(1), k) ∼= L(1), under the
A-module isomorphism f 7→ e1, and hence L(π)⊛ ∼= L(π) so that τ is a balanced involution.
Remark 2.35. This also applies to ˜A so we can extend τ to a homogeneous anti-involution τ ⊗m on
A⊗(m−1) ⊗k ˜A, for any m ∈ N. Indeed, τ ⊗m is also a balanced involution.
Now we have shown the algebras A⊗(m−1) ⊗k ˜A, m ∈ N, are aﬃne quasi-hereditary we can use the
following result of Kleshchev to deduce that A⊗(m−1) ⊗k ˜A, m ∈ N, are aﬃne cellular.
Proposition 2.36 ([Kle15], Proposition 9.8). Let B be an aﬃne quasi-hereditary algebra with a balanced
involution τ . Then B is an aﬃne cellular algebra.

Corollary 2.37. The algebras A⊗(m−1) ⊗k ˜A, m ∈ N are aﬃne cellular with respect to τ ⊗m.
Lemma 2.38 ([Yan14], Lemma 3.4). Let A be an algebra with an idempotent e ∈ A and a k-involution
i such that i(e) = e. Suppose that AeA = A and eAe is an aﬃne cellular algebra with respect to the
restriction of i to eAe. Then A is aﬃne cellular with respect to i.

Let us now recall the following notation. Suppose we have ﬁxed a reduced expression si1 ··· sik for some

Corollary 2.37 and Theorem 2.18, eWνe is aﬃne cellular with respect to the restriction of i. Then, by
Lemma 2.38, Wν is aﬃne cellular with respect to i.

Corollary 2.40. The VV algebras Wν in the setting p, q /∈ I are aﬃne cellular.
Proof. Fix ν ∈ θNIλ and take the associated VV algebra Wν. Fix e := Pi∈I ˜ν+ e(i) and let i be the

k-involution on Wν from Corollary 2.39. Then i(e) = e and, from Theorem 2.10, WνeWν = Wν . From
[KLM13] we know that KLR algebras of type A are aﬃne cellular. This means that eWνe is aﬃne
cellular with respect to the restriction of i. We now use Lemma 2.38 to conclude that Wν is aﬃne
cellular with respect to i.

We must also show φ(e(i) ⊗ za1) = φ(e(i)z ⊗ a1) and φ(e(i) ⊗ za2) = φ(e(i)z ⊗ a2). Firstly,

Secondly, noting that ϕηi(q−1) = m − ϕi(q) + 1,

φ(e(i) ⊗ za2) = φ(e(i) ⊗ −v1v2a2)

Proof. For (i) assume ﬁrst that p appears twice in i, say ik1 = ik2 = p. We require a ∈ e(i)Wνe(j),
b ∈ e(j)Wν e(i) such that ab = e(i) and ba = e(j), for some j ∈ I ˜ν+

Since i /∈ I ˜ν+ ∪ I ˜ν−
there is a non-empty subset {ε1, . . . , εd} ( {1, . . . , m}, with εr < εr+1 for all
r, such that iεr = p−(2nr+1), where nr ∈ Z>0 for all r. Note also that εr 6= k1, k2 for all r, since we
start with the assumption that p appears twice in i. Put,

a = e(i)σε1−1 ··· σ1πσε2−1 ··· σ1π ··· σεd−1 ··· σ1πe(j) ∈ e(i)Wνe(j)
b = e(j)πσ1 ··· σεd−1πσ1 ··· σεd−1−1 ··· πσ1 ··· σε1−1e(i) ∈ e(j)Wν e(i).

Then e(j) ∈ Wν is such that j ∈ I ˜ν+
and, from the relations, we know that ab = e(i) and ba = e(j)
so that e(i) ∼= e(j). The same argument can be used for the case when p−1 appears before p in i. A
similar argument is used for (ii).

Firstly, when we restrict the second tensorand to a1 or to a2, φ preserves the relations using the

k = 1, 2. We have, using Lemma 2.45 in the fourth equality,
φ(e(i) ⊗ za1) = φ(e(i) ⊗ v2v1a1)

= φ((xϕi,1(p) + xϕi,2(p))e(i) ⊗ a1)
= φ(e(i)z ⊗ a1).

Secondly, noting again from Lemma 2.45 that σρ
ϕηi,k(p−1) + 1 = ϕi,k(p) for k = 1, 2 we have

ησηe(ηi) = −(xϕηi,1(p−1) + xϕηi,2(p−1))e(ηi) and m −

= φ((xϕi,1(p) + xϕi,2(p))e(i) ⊗ a2)

φ(σi1 ··· σik e(ηj) ⊗ v2a2) = φ(σi1 ··· σik e(ηj) ⊗ a1)φ(e(ηj) ⊗ v2a2)

= σi1 ··· σik e(ηj)σηe(j)
= σsσηe(j)

= e(i)σwe(j).

The case e(i) ∈ R−

˜ν and e(j) ∈ R+

˜ν is similar.

It remains to show that φ is injective. Since φ is surjective we can show injectivity by showing equality
˜A and eWνe. This follows from the analogue of Lemma
between the graded dimensions of R+
2.42 applied to the current setting. Hence φ is an isomorphism.

˜ν ⊗k[x]

By Lemma 2.44 we have e full in Wν. This proves Morita equivalence between eWν e and R+

˜ν ⊗k[x]

˜A. (cid:3)

2.6. Summary of results. In various settings in which one deﬁnes VV algebras we ﬁnd a full idem-

potent e ∈ Wν and an algebra S such that eWνe ∼= S. From this it follows that Wν and S are Morita

equivalent, and we call e a Morita idempotent. We are then able to use these Morita equivalences to
prove, in certain settings, that VV algebras are aﬃne quasi-hereditary and graded aﬃne cellular. We
now summarise the results of Section 2 in the table below. We write ‘NA’ to mean not applicable and
we write ‘?’ to indicate that these questions have not yet been answered.
