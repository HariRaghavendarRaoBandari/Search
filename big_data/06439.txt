Abstract—Based on the idea of the Abelian group theory in
mathematics, this paper ﬁnds a sufﬁcient condition of having
independent TE and TM modes in a waveguide ﬁlled with
homogenous anisotropic lossless medium. For independent TE
modes, we prove the nonzero cut-off wavenumbers obtained
from longitudinal scalar magnetic ﬁeld stimulation and trans-
verse vector electric ﬁeld stimulation are same in theory. For
independent TM modes, we also prove the nonzero cut-off
wavenumbers obtained from longitudinal scalar electric ﬁeld
stimulation and transverse vector magnetic ﬁeld stimulation
are same in theory. Finally we carry out several numerical
experiments to verify the correctness of the condition given
by us. We hope that this condition is useful for the designs
of waveguide with homogenous anisotropic lossless medium in
microwave engineering community.

I. INTRODUCTION

In microwave engineering, waveguide is one of very impor-
tant source-free equipments, which guides wave propagation
direction. It has many applications, for example, Hirokawa
J. and Ando M. [1] have proposed a novel feed structure to
excite a plane TEM wave in a parallel-plate waveguide. The
electromagnetic wave in the waveguide must be a solution of
Maxwell’s equations with source-free.

According to the electromagnetic theory [2], it is well-
known that the waveguide ﬁlled with homogenous isotropic
lossless medium has independent TE modes and TM modes.
Suppose that the wave propagation direction in waveguide is
+ˆz. We also have known that for independent TE modes, we
can employ the longitudinal component hz of the magnetic
ﬁeld or the transverse component et of the electric ﬁeld
to stimulate them, and for independent TM modes, we can
employ the longitudinal component ez of the electric ﬁeld
or the transverse component ht of the magnetic ﬁeld to
stimulate them. For using longitudinal component hz of the
magnetic ﬁeld to stimulate independent TE modes, we need
to solve an eigenvalue problem about Laplace operator with
a Neumann boundary condition. This boundary condition is a
natural boundary condition in ﬁnite element method (FEM),
which is not enforced constraint in numerical computation.

University, Durham, NC 27708 USA

While for using longitudinal component ez of the electric ﬁeld
to stimulate independent TM modes, we need to solve an
eigenvalue problem about Laplace operator with a Dirichlet
boundary condition. This boundary condition is an essential
boundary condition in FEM, which must be enforced con-
straint in numerical computation. For employing transverse
component et of the electric ﬁeld to stimulate independent
TE modes, we need to solve an eigenvalue problem about
curl-curl operator with an essential boundary condition, which
must be enforced constraint in numerical computation, while
for employing transverse component ht of the magnetic ﬁeld
to stimulate independent TM modes, we need to solve an
eigenvalue problem about curl-curl operator with two natural
boundary conditions, which are all not enforced constraint in
numerical computation.

For the waveguide ﬁlled with homogenous anisotropic loss-
less medium, are there independent TE modes and TM modes
in this waveguide? The answer is that when the medium
parameters in the waveguide satisfy some condition, then there
are independent TE and TM modes. This paper ﬁnds this
condition (i.e., the following condition I and II) based on
the idea of the Abelian group theory [3] (see Appendix B)
in mathematics. Moreover, when the waveguide ﬁlled with
homogenous anisotropic lossless medium has independent TE
and TM modes, we prove that the nonzero cut-off wavenum-
bers obtained from using hz and et to stimulate indepen-
dent TE modes are same in theory, and the nonzero cut-off
wavenumbers obtained from using ez and ht to stimulate
independent TM modes are also same in theory.

When the cross section of the waveguide is not regular, if
we would like to know the ﬁrst several propagable physical
modes, we usually turn to the help of numerical methods,
for example, FEM, ﬁnite difference method, and etc. This
paper will use standard linear FEM to solve the eigenvalue
problems about elliptic differential operator of second-order
in two-dimension, and mixed FEM [4] based on CT/LN edge
element space and standard linear element space to solve the
eigenvalue problems of curl-curl operator in two-dimension.
The basis functions in the CT/LN edge element space are
constant tangential and liner normal (CT/LN). This space is
the lowest order edge element space, which is the simplest
edge element space. This space is one of the N´ed´elec spaces
[5]. Note that it is careful to the selection of these two spaces
in mixed FEM, and the selection of these two spaces should
be matched [4]. For the eigenvalue problems about curl-curl
operator (waveguide problems and resonant cavity problems

just belong to this type of problem), the earlier papers on edge
elements claim edge elements can entirely eliminate spurious
modes. This is not correct [6]. Because edge elements can only
eliminate nonphysical spurious nonzero modes, however, edge
elements can not eliminate nonphysical spurious zero modes
because of ignoring the divergence-free condition. We have
computed the resonant cavity problem with anisotropic lossless
media and PEC successfully [7]. In the reference [7] we turn
to the help of mixed FEM based on CT/LN edge element
space and linear element space to remove all the nonphysical
spurious modes. Numerical methods provided by this paper
can remove all the nonphysical spurious modes (including
nonphysical spurious zero modes) for the eigenvalue problems
about curl-curl operator, because we have already enforced
divergence-free condition in numerical computation.

The outline of this paper is as follows. In Section 2,
we review the governing equations for waveguide problems
according to the waveguide theory in electromagnetism, and
ﬁnd this sufﬁcient condition of having independent TE and
TM modes in a waveguide ﬁlled with homogenous anisotropic
lossless medium. The proof of the conclusion that the nonzero
cut-off wavenumbers obtained from using hz and et to stimu-
late independent TE modes are same is given in Section 3. The
proof of the conclusion that the nonzero cut-off wavenumbers
obtained from using ez and ht to stimulate independent TM
modes are same is given in Section 4. In Section 5, we support
several FEM algorithms of PDEs from waveguide problems.
Finally we carry out some numerical experiments to verify
that the condition given by us is correct, and the theory in
Section 3 and 4 is also correct.

II. GOVERNING EQUATIONS FOR WAVEGUIDE PROBLEMS
Suppose that the wave propagation direction in waveguide
is ˆz, where ˆz is unit vector along positive direction of z axis.
Let Γ be cross section of the waveguide, ˆn be be the outward
normal unit vector on the boundary ∂Γ of the cross section
Γ. As usual, the cross section Γ is bounded. Because of the
complexity of the cross section Γ, the boundary ∂Γ may be not
connected. In this case, there exist TEM modes. In practical
applications, waveguide walls are usually made up of perfect
electric conductor.

Waveguide problem is a so called 2.5 dimensional problem,
because the medium in the waveguide is two dimensional,
while the electromagnetic ﬁeld in the waveguide is three
dimensional. This paper only considers the waveguide prob-
lem ﬁlled with ﬁlled with homogenous anisotropic lossless
medium. Suppose that the permittivity and permeability ma-
trices are of the following form:

(cid:20) t
(cid:20) µt

0

(cid:21)
(cid:21)

,

zz

 =

µ =

(2)

,

where t, µt, zz and µzz are independent of z. Because the
medium is lossless, we have that  and µ are two positive
deﬁnite Hermitian matricies [8], i.e.,

†
†
t = t, µ
t = µt,



zz > 0, µzz > 0,

2

where t and µt have positive real eigenvalues, and K† is
conjugate transpose of matrix K.

In a usual waveguide problem, the frequency f > 0 is given,
then ω = 2πf > 0. We need to solve propagation constant
jkz and several propagable physical modes:

E(x, y, z) = e(x, y)e−jkzz, H(x, y, z) = h(x, y)e−jkzz,

(3)
where e(x, y) and h(x, y) are two three dimensional vectors
only dependent with transversal coordinates (x, y), while
independent with longitudinal coordinate z. Assume that

e(x, y) = et + ˆzez, h(x, y) = ht + ˆzhz,

Writing Maxwell’s equations with source-free, we have:

∇ × E = −jωµH,
∇ × H = jωE,
∇ · (E) = 0,
∇ · (µH) = 0,

where we have assumed that the time-harmonic factor is ejωt.
Substituting (1-5) into the above Maxwell’s equations, then
we obtain the following equations:

∇t × et = −jωµzz ˆzhz

−ˆz × ∇tez − jkz ˆz × et = −jωµtht
∇t × ht = jωzz ˆzez

, then A2 = −I2×2, where I2×2 is

and (9) into A, then we get

From equations (12) and (13), we can obtain

(−ω2AµtAt − k2
(−ω2AtAµt − k2
zI2×2)ht = −jkz∇thz − jωAt∇tez. (15)
Next we try to explore the condition of having independent
TE and TM modes in a waveguide ﬁlled with homogenous
anisotropic lossless medium, and the case in ﬁlled with ho-
mogenous isotropic lossless medium is a particular case of
this condition.
Deﬁne set G = {X ∈ C2×2 : AX = XA}, then the
set G has very nice algebraic properties. It is very easy to
prove that (G, +) is an Abelian group, where + is usual
matrix addition in C2×2 and (G,·) is also an group, where
· is usual matrix multiplication in C2×2. Next we intensively

Thus coefﬁcient matrices in equations (14) and (15) are same:

then the independent TE and TM modes must exist
in
the waveguide ﬁlled with homogenous anisotropic lossless
medium.
Remark: It is well-known that when the waveguide is ﬁlled
with homogenous isotropic lossless medium, then there are
independent TE and TM modes in this waveguide. In this case,
a = 0, b = 0,  = zz > 0 and µ = µzz > 0. Obviously, the
medium parameters have already satisﬁed the above condition
I and II.

Next we consider the boundary condition about waveguide
problem. Because the waveguide walls are usually made up
of metal, the boundary condition is usually perfect electric
conductor (PEC) boundary condition. From electromagnetic
theory [2], we have

ˆn × E = 0,

ˆn · B = 0.

For the TE modes, if we use longitudinal scalar ﬁeld hz
to stimulate them, then the boundary condition will be ˆn ·
(µt∇thz) = 0 on ∂Γ; if we use transverse vector ﬁeld et to
stimulate them, then the boundary condition will be ˆn × et =
0 on ∂Γ.

For the TM modes, if we use longitudinal scalar ﬁeld ez
to stimulate them, then the boundary condition will be ez =
0 on ∂Γ; if we use transverse vector ﬁeld ht to stimulate them,
then the boundary condition will be ˆn· (µtht) = 0 on ∂Γ and
ˆn × (−1

III. INDEPENDENT TE MODES

In this section, the medium parameters in the waveguide we

consider satisfy the condition I and II.

The PDE (24) is an eigenvalue problem about elliptic par-

and this problem is with Neumann boundary condition. The
researches about this problem are very thorough in computa-
tional mathematics. For details, please see [9].

It is clear that the equation (24) has a particular solution
kt = 0, hz = 1, but this solution is not a propagable physical
mode, and this is a spurious mode. We shall not consider this
solution. Once (kt, hz) is solved, then

the electromagnetic wave with high-frequency can propagate
in the waveguide.

Which can be veriﬁed by the following numerical experiments.
PDEs (25) can stimulate these TEM modes, while PDE (24)
can not stimulate these TEM modes, which is an advantage of
using et to simulate waveguide modes. Moreover, PDE (24)
will also introduce a nonphysical spurious zero mode.

In a word, we have already obtained the following theorem.

Theorem 1. If the medium parameters in a waveguide satis-
ﬁes the condition I and II, then there exist independent TE
modes in this waveguide, and nonzero cut-off wavenumber kt
between PDE (24) and PDEs (25) is same in theory.

IV. INDEPENDENT TM MODES

In this section, the medium parameters in the waveguide we

consider also have the condition I and II.

The PDE (26) is an eigenvalue problem about elliptic partial
differential operator of second order in two-dimension, and
this problem is with Dirichlet boundary condition.

It is easy to prove that kt = 0 is not an eigenvalue of PDE
(26). In fact, if kt = 0 is an eigenvalue of PDE (26), then we
can prove that ez = 0 in Γ by virtue of the Poincar´e inequality
(cid:107)ez(cid:107)1 ≤ C(cid:107)∇ez(cid:107)0 [12]. According to spectral theory of self-
adjoint compact operator [10], the PDE (26) has countable real
positive eigenvalues.

Proof. For the veriﬁcation of the ﬁst two equations in PDEs
(27), this is the same as the TE modes, therefore we omit this
step. We mainly need to verify the correctness of boundary
conditions in PDEs (27). According to ˆn× E = 0 and ez = 0
on ∂Γ, then we have ˆn×(et + ˆzez)e−jkzz = ˆn×ete−jkzz = 0
on ∂Γ. Therefore we have ˆn× et = 0 on ∂Γ. For TM modes,
we have hz = 0. We can take hz = 0 in the equation (9), then

When ∂Γ is not connected, the PDEs (27) can also stim-

Proof. For the veriﬁcation of the equation in PDE (26), this
is the same as the TE modes, therefore we omit this step. We
mainly need to verify the correctness of boundary condition

ˆzez)e−jkzz = 0 on ∂Γ. From the above equation, then we
get ˆn × (ˆzez) = 0 on ∂Γ, thus ez = 0 on ∂Γ. In addition,
according to (29), we have

V. NUMERICAL METHODS FOR INDEPENDENT TE MODES

AND TM MODES

A. Numerical Method for the scalar PDE (24) and (26)

Firstly, we consider the numerical treatments for the scalar
PDE (24) and (26). There are many ﬁnite element methods
to deal with the scalar PDE (24) and (26) now. For example,
conforming FEM, nonconforming FEM, and mixed FEM can
solve all them numerically. FEM is a numerical method based
on the variational form of PDE. Thus we need to give the
corresponding variational forms about the scalar PDE (24) and
(26) ﬁrstly.

As usual, we need to introduce some Hilbert spaces on

complex ﬁeld C associated with PDE (24) and (26):

(cid:90)

L2(Γ) =(cid:8)f :
|f (x, y)|2dxdy < +∞(cid:9),
H 1(Γ) =(cid:8)v ∈ L2(Γ) : ∇tv ∈ (L2(Γ))2(cid:9),
0 (Γ) =(cid:8)v ∈ H 1(Γ) : v|∂Γ = 0(cid:9).

where the function v is complex conjugation of function v.

The standard inner products and norms in the above Hilbert
spaces are deﬁned as following:

(uv + ∇tu · ∇tv)dxdy, ∀ u, v ∈ H 1(Γ),
2 , ∀ v ∈ H 1(Γ),

approximate the Hilbert space H 1(Γ), and V2 = Sh(cid:84) H 1

The advantage of triangular mesh is that it can approximate
arbitrary bounded domain Γ in two-dimension well. We are
only plan to use the standard linear element space V1 = Sh to
0 (Γ)
to approximate the Hilbert space H 1
0 (Γ). It is clear that V1
is a FEM subspace of H 1(Γ), and V2 is a FEM subspace of
0 (Γ). Restricting (30) and (31) on V1 and V2 respectively,
H 1
then we get discrete variational forms about (30) and (31).

where superscript or subscript h stands for approximate so-

the conforming FEM. Assume that the approximate eigenval-
ues of variational form (32) are
t,h ≤ k(2)

t,h ≤ ··· ≤ k(n−1)

t,h < k(1)

0 ≈ k(0)

where n is all the nodal number in the mesh Th, including
the number of the nodes on the boundary ∂Γ. According to
min-max principle [13], we have

t ≤ k(l)

t,h, l = 1, 2,··· , n − 1.

Similarly, suppose that the approximate eigenvalues of varia-
tional form (33) are

where m is interior nodal number in the mesh Th, excluding

Therefore the numerical eigenvalues obtained from conform-
ing FEM approximate exact eigenvalues from above, which
is the characteristic of employing conforming FEM to solve
eigenvalue problems about

order. From numerical experiments, we shall ﬁnd that all the

ξ = [ξ1, ξ2,··· , ξm]T .

B. Numerical Method for the Vector PDEs (25) and (27)

Secondly, we consider the numerical

treatments for the
vector PDEs (25) and (27), which are much more difﬁcult than
for the scalar PDE (24) and (26), because of the constraint
of divergence-free condition in PDEs (25) and (27). Until
now the conforming FEM discretization about PDEs (25) and
(27) has not appear, because it is very difﬁcult to construct a
conforming FEM subspace corresponding to the vector PDEs
(25) and (27) [14]. We shall use mixed FEM to solve the
vector PDEs (25) and (27). Next we give mixed variational
forms associated with the vector PDEs (25) and (27).

As usual, we need to introduce some Hilbert spaces on

complex ﬁeld C associated with PDEs (25) and (27):

H(curlt, Γ) =(cid:8)F ∈ (L2(Γ))2 : ∇t × F ∈ L2(Γ)(cid:9),
H0(curlt, Γ) =(cid:8)F ∈ H(curlt, Γ) : ˆn × F|∂Γ = 0(cid:9).

The standard inner product and norm in the above Hilbert
space is deﬁned as following: for ∀ F1, F2, F ∈ H(curlt, Γ),

Using scalar Green’s formula (43) and vector Green’s formula
(44), we get the variational forms of PDEs (25) and (27),
respectively.

t B2(ht, F) ∀ F ∈ H(curlt, Γ),

(37a)
(37b)

It is clear that the variational forms (36) and (37) are equivalent
to PDEs (25) and (27), respectively. We must solve variational
forms (36a) and (37a) under the constraint of (36b) and (37b),
respectively. Based on Kikuchi’s work [15], we try to change
the variation forms (36) and (37) to the corresponding mixed
variational forms by means of a Lagrangian multiplier.
Let us now introduce the mixed variational form associated
with the TE modes: Seek kt ∈ R, 0 (cid:54)= et ∈ H0(curlt, Γ),
p1 ∈ H 1
A1(et, F) + C1(F, p1) = k2

0 (Γ) such that

t B1(et, F) ∀ F ∈ H0(curlt, Γ),
(38a)
(38b)

0 (Γ).

C1(et, q) = 0 ∀ q ∈ H 1

Let us now introduce the mixed variational form associated
with the TM modes: Seek kt ∈ R, 0 (cid:54)= ht ∈ H(curlt, Γ),
p2 ∈ H 1(Γ) such that
A2(ht, F) + C2(F, p2) = k2

t B2(ht, F) ∀ F ∈ H(curlt, Γ),
(39a)
(39b)
where pk (k = 1, 2) are the Lagrangian multipliers and
Ck(F, pk) (k = 1, 2) stand for the complex conjugation of
the continuous sesquilinear form Ck(F, pk) (k = 1, 2). The
weak forms (38) and (39) are the saddle point problems in
ﬁnite element analysis.

C2(ht, q) = 0 ∀ q ∈ H 1(Γ),

−1
t

t B2(ht,∇tp2) = k2

We have already proved the equivalence between the vari-
ational form (36) and mixed variational form (38) in [11],
because p1 = 0 in Γ is proved in [11]. Now we prove the
equivalence between the variational form (37) and mixed
variational form (39). Obviously, any eigenpair of (37) with
p2 = C satisﬁes (39), where C is an arbitrary constant. Con-
versely, by taking F = ∇tp2 in (39a) and q = p2 in (39b), we
get C2(∇tp2, p2) = k2
t C2(ht,∇tp2) = 0.
Since 
has positive real eigenvalues, we can deduce that
∇tp2 = 0, therefore p2 = C and C2(F, p2) = 0, which
shows that any eigenpair of the mixed variational form (39)
satisﬁes (37) as well. Numerical experiments are also shown
that p2 = C in Γ. Next we utilize mixed FEM to discretize
the mixed variational problems (38) and (39), respectively.
Let Th be a regular triangular partition [12] of Γ with mesh
parameter h. About the deﬁnition of CT/LN edge element
space, please see [11]. Here we only consider the discretization
of mixed variation form (39). For the discretization of mixed
variation form (38), for details, please see [11]. Let W2
h be
h = span{N1, N2, ..., Ns},
CT/LN edge element space and W2
where Nk is the k-th global basis function in W2
h and the
integer s is the number of total edges (including the edges on
the boundary) in triangular mesh Th. From [16, 17], we know

For the implementation of the mixed variational form (40),
we do not need to deal with the boundary conditions, because
two boundary conditions in PDE (27) are all natural boundary
conditions in FEM. However, about
imple-
mentation of the mixed variational form (38), the numerical
treatment method is almost same as the mixed variational
form (39), but at last we need to enforce boundary condition,
because for the TE modes, ˆn × et = 0 on Γ is an essential
boundary condition in FEM.

VI. NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS

In this section, we shall consider four familiar waveguides,
i.e., rectangular waveguide, cylindrical waveguide, coaxial
waveguide and double-ridge waveguide. These waveguides are
ﬁlled with homogenous anisotropic lossless medium, which
satisﬁes the above condition I and II. The physical dimensions
of these four waveguides are listed in Fig.1. Assume that the
medium parameters in these four waveguides are

From the Fig. 2 and Fig. 4, we ﬁnd that the Lagrange
1,h ≈ 0 (l = 1, 2) corresponding to vector PDEs
multiplier p(l)
(25), which is agreement with the theory in section V. From
the Fig. 3 and Fig. 5, we can see that the Lagrange multiplier
p(l)
2,h = C (l = 1, 2) corresponding to vector PDEs (27), which
is also agreement with the theory in section V.

At last, from Table VIII, we see that the numerical accuracy
of the ﬁrst eigenvalue is more worse than one of remain-
ing three eigenvalues, because the smoothness of the ﬁrst
eigenfunction is very bad [18], this will reduce the rate of
convergence for the ﬁrst numerical eigenvalue.

VII. CONCLUSION

This paper gives a sufﬁcient condition of having indepen-
dent TE and TM modes in a waveguide ﬁlled with homoge-
nous anisotropic lossless medium. In the future, we would like
to give a necessary condition of having independent TE and
TM modes in a waveguide ﬁlled with homogenous anisotropic
lossless medium. In that time, the problem that whether there
exist independent TE and TM modes in a waveguide ﬁlled
with homogenous anisotropic lossless medium will be solved
thoroughly.

coaxial waveguide, we ﬁnd the existence of a TEM mode in
Table III and VII, because there are two disconnected bound-
aries in the coaxial waveguide. Moreover, we have already
drawn the magnitude and direction of the electromagnetic ﬁeld
associated with this TEM mode in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5. However
for other three waveguides, because these three waveguides
have connected boundary, we do not ﬁnd the existence of any
TEM mode, which is in accordance with the waveguide theory.
From the Table I-IV, we can see that for independent TE
modes, all the nonzero numerical cut-off wavenumbers from
between the scalar PDE (24) and the vector PDEs (26) are
same roughly, which are agreements with the Theorem 1
in section III. From the Table V-VIII, we can see that for
independent TM modes, all the nonzero numerical cut-off
wavenumbers from between the scalar PDE (25) and the vector
PDEs (27) are same roughly, which are also agreements with
the Theorem 2 in section IV. From the Table I-VIII, we can
observe that all the numerical eigenvalues obtained from the
scalar PDE (24) and (26) approximate the exact eigenvalues
from above, which are coincided with the conclusion of min-
max principle [13]. However for all numerical eigenvalues
obtained from the vector PDEs (25) and (27), sometimes they
will approximate the exact eigenvalues from above, sometimes
approximate the exact eigenvalues from below, and even swing
