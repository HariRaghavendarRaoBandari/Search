WELL-POSEDNESS AND LONG-TIME BEHAVIOR FOR THE

WESTERVELT EQUATION WITH ABSORBING BOUNDARY

CONDITIONS OF ORDER ZERO

GIERI SIMONETT AND MATHIAS WILKE

Dedicated to Jan Pr¨uss on the occasion of his retirement

Abstract. We investigate the Westervelt equation from nonlinear acoustics,
subject to nonlinear absorbing boundary conditions of order zero, which were
recently proposed in [14, 24]. We apply the concept of maximal regularity
of type Lp to prove global well-posedness for small initial data. Moreover,
we show that the solutions regularize instantaneously which means that they
are C∞ with respect to time t as soon as t > 0. Finally, we show that
each equilibrium is stable and each solution which starts suﬃciently close
to an equilibrium converges at an exponential rate to a possibly diﬀerent
equilibrium.

1. Introduction and the model

We are concerned with the so-called Westervelt equation

(1.1)

utt − c2∆u − β∆ut = γ(u2)tt,

which is used to describe the propagation of sound in ﬂuidic media. The function
u(t, x) denotes the acoustic pressure ﬂuctuation from an ambient value at time
t and position x. Furthermore, c > 0 denotes the velocity of sound, β > 0 the
diﬀusivity of sound and γ > 0 the parameter of nonlinearity. The Westervelt
equation can be regarded as a simpliﬁcation of Kuznetsov’s equation

(1.2)

utt − c2∆u − β∆ut = γ(u2)tt + |v|2
tt.

Here the velocity ﬂuctuation v(t, x) is related to the pressure ﬂuctuation by means
of an acoustic potential ψ(t, x), such that u = ρ0ψt, v = −∇ψ with ambient
density ρ0 > 0. This equation is used as a basic equation in nonlinear acoustics,
see [8, 15, 17]. It can be derived from the balances of mass and momentum (the
compressible Navier-Stokes equations for Newtonian ﬂuids) and a state equation
for the pressure-dependent density of the ﬂuid. We refer to [15] for a derivation of
Kuznetsov’s equation.

Observe that the left hand side of (1.1) is a strongly damped wave equation,
which is of parabolic type. Taking the highest order terms on the right hand side

of (1.1) into account, we claim that parabolicity is preserved provided that the
pressure ﬂuctuation u admits values which are suﬃciently close to zero. To see
this, we use the identity

wherefore we may rewrite (1.1) as follows:

(u2)tt = 2uutt + 2(ut)2,

(c−2 − 2γu)utt − ∆u − β∆ut = 2γ(ut)2.

2γc2 . To this end
Consequently we see that (1.1) degenerates as u gets close to
1
we allow the function |u| to take values in the interval [0,
2γc2 ) in order to use
features from the parabolic theory for PDEs.

If one considers the Westervelt equation (1.1) in a bounded framework, i.e.
x ∈ Ω and Ω ⊂ Rd is open and bounded, then one has to equip (1.1) with suit-
able boundary conditions on the boundary ∂Ω. The Westervelt (resp. Kuznetsov)
equation with linear boundary conditions of Dirichlet- or Neumann-type has been
analyzed by a number of authors, see e.g. [2, 9, 10, 11, 12, 18, 19], which is just
a selection. The basic diﬀerence is the choice of the functional analytic setting.
While in [2, 9, 10, 11, 12] the analysis is based on L2-theory and energy estimates,
the authors in [18, 19] use the technique of maximal regularity of type Lp and
obtain optimal regularity results, which is feasible by the parabolic nature of (1.1)
or (1.2) as long as u is close to zero. Moreover, in [10, 12, 18, 19], the authors prove
exponential stability of the trivial solution u = 0 of the Westervelt or Kuznetsov
equation with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions.

From a point of view of applications one is often confronted with the situation
that the region of interest is small compared to the underlying acoustic propagation
domain. One way out of this problem is to truncate the large domain and to equip
(1.1) or (1.2) with so-called absorbing boundary conditions. Recently, Kaltenbacher
& Shevchenko [14, 24] derived and proposed absorbing boundary conditions of
order zero and order one for the Westervelt equation (1.1) in one and two space
dimensions. This type of boundary conditions can e.g. be interpreted as a kind of
feedback control for stabilizing (1.1). In this paper we consider absorbing boundary
conditions of order zero, which look as follows:

∂ν (u + βut) + utpc−2 − 2γu = 0

on ∂Ω.

(1.3)

Here ν is the outer unit normal vector ﬁeld on ∂Ω and ∂ν denotes the normal
derivative. At this point we want to emphasize that in contrast to the classi-
cal Dirichlet- or Neumann boundary conditions, the boundary condition (1.3) is
nonlinear.

Complementing (1.1) with initial conditions for u and ut, we end up with the

initial boundary value problem

(1.4)

c−2utt − ∆u − β∆ut = γ(u2)tt,

in J × Ω,

∂ν(u + βut) + utpc−2 − 2γu = 0,

(u(0), ut(0)) = (u0, u1),

for the Westervelt equation, where J = (0, T ) for some T ∈ (0,∞), Ω ⊂ Rd, d ∈ N,
is a bounded domain with boundary ∂Ω ∈ C2 and the parameters c > 0, β > 0
and γ > 0 are given.
To the best of the authors’ knowledge there seems to be only the article by
Kaltenbacher & Shevchenko [14] which deals with the analysis of problem (1.4)
in one and two space dimensions (the proofs of the results in [14] are carried out
in [13]). The technique used in [13, 14] to establish well-posedness is based on an
L2-theory and energy estimates combined with the contraction mapping principle.
The article [14] is complemented with some numerical results, showing that the
absorbing boundary conditions proposed and derived in [14] demonstrate more
accurate numerical results as compared to those proposed by Engquist & Majda
[7]. Finally, it should be noted that the authors in [14] also derive absorbing
boundary conditions of ﬁrst order which for the Westervelt equation result in
dynamic boundary conditions for the pressure ﬂuctuation u.

The present paper provides a rather complete analysis of problem (1.4). We
will present optimal conditions on the initial data (u0, u1) for the existence and
uniqueness of a solution to (1.4), thereby improving the assumptions on (u0, u1)
in [14] (for details see below). In addition, we investigate the temporal regularity
of the solutions to (1.4) as well as their long-time behavior.

Our program for studying (1.4) is as follows. In Section 2 we consider the prin-
cipal linearization of (1.4) in u = 0 and we prove optimal regularity results of type
Lp for the resulting parabolic problem. Unfortunately one cannot directly apply
the results in [3, 4] or [16] to the linear problem, since after a transformation of
(1.4) to a ﬁrst order system with respect to the variable t, the principal lineariza-
tion is neither parameter elliptic nor normally elliptic. Instead we will treat the
linearization of (1.4) in its original second order formulation as it has already been
done in [19] for the Kuznetsov equation (1.2) with Dirichlet boundary conditions.
Section 3 is devoted to the proof of the following result concerning well-posedness

of (1.4) under optimal conditions on the initial value (u0, u1).
Theorem 1.1. Let p > d + 1, p 6= 3, J = (0, T ), Ω ⊂ Rd, d ∈ N be a bounded
domain with boundary ∂Ω ∈ C2. Then for each T ∈ (0,∞) there exists δ > 0 such
that for all (u0, u1) ∈ W 2

if p > 3, there is a unique solution

of (1.4). In addition, the solution satisﬁes

4

GIERI SIMONETT AND MATHIAS WILKE

and the data-to-solution map

[(u0, u1) 7→ u(u0, u1)] : BXγ (0, δ) → E1(J)

is continuous.

For the proof of Theorem 1.1 we employ the implicit function theorem and the
results on optimal regularity of the linearization (see Section 2) in a neighborhood
of u = 0. This in turn yields the desired bound kuk∞ < 1
2γc2 . At this point we
want to emphasize that the assertions of Theorem 1.1 remain true if one replaces
the assumption p > d + 1 by the weaker condition p > max{ d
4 + 1} (cf. Remark
3.2). Therefore the case p = 2 can be covered provided that d ≤ 3. In particular,
for p = 2, the initial value (u0, u1) has to be small in W 2
2 (Ω) compared
to the assumption in [14, Theorems 3.1 & 3.2] where (u0, u1) has to be small in
W 2
2 (Ω). Thus, we were able to reduce the regularity for u1. Note that
the compatibility condition (1.5) is not needed in case p < 3.

2 (Ω) × W 2
In Section 4 we study the regularity of the solution with respect to the temporal
variable t. We use a parameter trick which goes back to Angenent [1], combined
with the implicit function theorem to prove that the solution is inﬁnitely many
times diﬀerentiable with respect to t as soon as t > 0, see Theorem 4.1. This result
reﬂects the parabolic regularization eﬀect.

2 (Ω) × W 1

2 , d

Finally, in Section 5, we address the question about the long-time behavior of
solutions to (1.4). For that purpose we reformulate (1.4) as a ﬁrst order system
with respect to t and consider the set E of equilibria, given by

E =(cid:26)(r, 0) : r ∈ R, |r| <

1

2γc2(cid:27) .

If A0 denotes the full linearization in (r, 0) ∈ E, we prove that

• 0 ∈ σ(A0) is semi-simple and
• σ(A0)\{0} ⊂ C

− = {z ∈ C : Re z < 0}.

Relying on the maximal regularity results from Sections 2 & 3 and applying the
results in [23] this implies that each (r, 0) ∈ E is stable (in the sense of Lyapunov)
and each solution of (1.4) with initial values suﬃciently close to (r, 0) converges
at an exponential rate to a possibly diﬀerent equilibrium as t → ∞, see Theorem
5.1.

2. Maximal regularity of the linearization

Let’s take a look at the regularity of u at the boundary. For

and

(J; Lp(∂Ω)) ∩ Lp(J; W 2−1/p
hence ∂ν u as well as ut|∂Ω carry additional time regularity compared to ∂νut. The
same holds for the term ∆u compared to utt and ∆ut, since

We use these facts for the terms ∂νu as well as ∆u and study in a ﬁrst step the

Let us solve the problem

This is possible since the given functions (f, g, u1) belong to the optimal regularity
classes and the compatibility condition (2.2) holds. Then we deﬁne

u(t, x) := u0(x) +Z t

v(s, x)ds

for all t ∈ [0, T ] and x ∈ Ω. Clearly we have u(0, x) = u0(x), ∂j

for J = [0, T ] and every ﬁnite T > 0. This implies that
p (J; W 2

and u solves (2.1), showing existence. To prove uniqueness, assume that u1, u2
solve (2.1), hence u := u1 − u2 solves (2.1) with (f, g, u0, u1) = 0. Deﬁning v := ut
it follows that v solves (2.3) with trivial data (f, g, u1) = 0. Since the solution

6

to (2.3) is unique, it follows that v = 0, hence ut = 0, hence u = u0 = 0. We
summarize the preceeding result in the following
Lemma 2.1. Let p ∈ (1,∞), p 6= 3, α ≥ 0, J = (0, T ), T ∈ (0,∞), Ω ⊂ Rd,
d ∈ N, be a bounded domain with boundary ∂Ω ∈ C2. Then there exists a unique
solution

p (Ω)) =: E1(J)
of (2.1) if and only if the data satisfy the following conditions.

p (J; Lp(Ω)) ∩ Lp(J; W 2

solves (2.3) and the assertions for f, g and u1 follow from the equations and trace
theory, see e.g. [4, 22]. Finally, by Sobolev embedding, we obtain

u ∈ W 1

p (J; W 2

p (Ω)) ֒→ C([0, T ]; W 2

p (Ω)),

(cid:3)

hence u0 ∈ W 2

p (Ω).
For u ∈ E1(J) let

Lu := [c−2utt − β∆ut, β∂νut + αut, (u(0), ut(0))].

With this notation it follows from Lemma 2.1 that the linear mapping
L : E1(J) → {(f, g, (u0, u1)) ∈ E0(J) × F(J) × Xγ : β∂ν u1 + αu1 = g(0) if p > 3}
is a bounded isomorphism with a bounded inverse. It will be convenient to intro-
duce the following subspaces of F(J) and E1(J). Let

and

For u ∈ 0E1(J) let

0F(J) := {g ∈ F(J) : g(0) = 0}

0E1(J) := {u ∈ E1(J) : u(0) = ut(0) = 0}.

L0u := [c−2utt − β∆ut, β∂νut + αut].

Then, by Lemma 2.1, the mapping

L0 : 0E1(J) → E0(J) × 0F(J)

is a bounded isomorphism and by standard reﬂection arguments it can be shown
that the norm of the inverse L−1
is independent of T ∈ (0, T0] for every ﬁxed
T0 > 0.

We will now take care of the lower order terms ∂ν u and ∆u. To this end,

consider ﬁrst the case (u0, u1) = 0 and deﬁne a mapping
R0 : 0E1(J) → E0(J) × 0F(J)

by R0u := [−∆u, ∂νu]. The linear problem

(2.4)

c−2utt − ∆u − β∆ut = f,
∂νu + β∂ν ut + αut = g,

(u(0), ut(0)) = (0, 0),

in J × Ω,
in J × ∂Ω,
in Ω,

is then equivalent to the abstract equation

L0u + R0u = [f, g]

L0u + R0u = L0(I + L−1

for u ∈ 0E1(J) and some given functions (f, g) ∈ E0(J) × 0F(J). Observe that
(2.5)
since L0 is invertible by Lemma 2.1. Using the fact that the norm of L−1
0 does not
depend on T ∈ (0, T0] for some ﬁxed T0 > 0, it follows that there exists a constant
C = C(T0) > 0 such that
kL−1

0 R0uk0E1(J) ≤ CkR0ukE0(J)× 0F(J)

for all T ∈ (0, T0]. Furthermore we have

We use the Sobolev embedding

0W 1

p (0, T ; W 2

p (Ω)) ֒→ {u ∈ C([0, T ]; W 2

p (Ω)) : u(0) = 0}

and the fact that the corresponding embedding constant m > 0 is independent of
T > 0 to obtain the estimate

k∆ukE0(J) ≤ kukLp(0,T ;W 2

p (Ω)) ≤ T 1/pkukC([0,T ];W 2

p (Ω))

≤ mT 1/pkuk0W 1

p (0,T ;W 2

p (Ω)) ≤ mT 1/pkuk0E1(J).

Furthermore, by trace theory we have
k∂νuk0F(J) ≤ Ckuk0W 1

p (0,T ;Lp(Ω))∩Lp(0,T ;W 2

p (Ω)),

where the constant C > 0 is again independent of T > 0. Making use of Sobolev
embeddings again, we obtain as above a constant C > 0 which does not depend
on T > 0 such that

In summary we have shown that the estimate

k∂νuk0F(J) ≤ CT 1/pkuk0E1(J).

kL−1

0 R0uk0E1(J) ≤ CkR0ukE0(J)× 0F(J) ≤ CT 1/pkuk0E1(J)

holds for all u ∈ 0E1(J). Therefore, if 0 < T < min{1/Cp, T0}, a Neumann series
argument yields that the operator I + L−1
0 R0 : 0E1(J) → 0E1(J) is invertible,
hence, by (2.5),

L0 + R0 : 0E1(J) → E0(J) × 0F(J)

8

is invertible as well.

In a next step we take nontrivial initial values into account. To this end let

f ∈ E0(J), g ∈ F(J) and (u0, u1) ∈ Xγ be given such that

∂νu0 + β∂νu1 + αu1 = g(0)
on {t = 0} × ∂Ω if p > 3. Extend u1 ∈ W 2−2/p
W 2−2/p
the full space problem

(Ω) to some function ˜u1 ∈
(Rd), which is always possible by the assumption ∂Ω ∈ C2. Then solve

see e.g. [3, Chapter II] or [22, Chapter 6]. This in turn implies that the restriction

p (Ω))
and w(0) = ˜u1|Ω = u1. Then we solve the abstract equation

and the solution is unique by the considerations above. A successive application
of this procedure yields a unique solution u ∈ E1(J) on any ﬁnite interval (0, T ).
We have thus proven the following result.
Theorem 2.2. Let p ∈ (1,∞), p 6= 3, α ≥ 0, J = (0, T ), T ∈ (0,∞), Ω ⊂ Rd,

Remark 2.3. Note that (2.7) does not have optimal regularity of type Lp on R+.
Indeed, for u0 = c ∈ R and u1 = 0, the pair (c, 0) ∈ E1(J) is a solution of (2.7)
with (f, g) = 0, but (c, 0) /∈ E1(R+).

3. Nonlinear well-posedness

Let us start with the following regularity result. In order to keep things simple,

we assume for a moment that γ = 1
Proposition 3.1. Let p > d + 1, let J = [0, T ] for some T ∈ (0,∞) and assume
that Ω ⊂ Rd is a bounded domain with boundary ∂Ω ∈ C2. For (t, x) ∈ J × Ω and

Proof. 1. Note that F(J) is the trace space of the anisotropic space

see e.g. [20, Theorem 4.5]. Furthermore, by Sobolev embedding, it holds that

Note that in case p > d + 1, the space X(J) is a Banach algebra. Since kutkX(J) ≤

in Lp(J; Lp(Ω)). Since E1(J) ֒→ Lp(J; W 1
above, hence kF (u)kX(J) < ∞. This proves the ﬁrst assertion.
2. We show that F ∈ C1, the existence of the higher order derivatives follows
inductively. Again, since X(J) is an algebra, it suﬃces to show that [u 7→ √1 − u] ∈
C1(V(J); X(J)). Fix u ∈ V(J) and let khkE1(J) ≤ δ with δ > 0 being suﬃciently
small such that u + h ∈ V(J). This is possible, since V(J) is open in E1(J). By
the fundamental theorem of calculus, we obtain the identity

G(u(t, x) + h(t, x)) − G(u(t, x)) − G′(u(t, x))h(t, x) =

G′′(u(t, x) + sτ h(t, x))dsdτ h(t, x)2,

where G(r) := √1 − r and r < 1.
It is easy to see that kG′′(u + sτ h)kX(J) is
uniformly bounded with respect to s, τ ∈ [0, 1] and khkE1(J) ≤ δ. Therefore, the
algebra property of X(J) and the fact that E1(J) ֒→ X(J) yields that [u 7→ G(u)]

DuH(0, (0, 0))bu =(cid:20)c−2butt − ∆bu − β∆but

the implicit function theorem, there exists a ball BXγ ((0, 0), r), 0 < r < δ and a
unique function ψ ∈ C∞(BXγ ((0, 0), r); 0W(J)) such that H(ψ(u0, u1), (u0, u1)) =

4. Higher regularity

Let u∗ ∈ E1(J) be the unique solution to (1.4) which exists thanks to Theorem
1.1. Let ε ∈ (0, 1) be ﬁxed but as small as we please and let Jε = [0, T /(1 + ε)].
For t ∈ Jε and λ ∈ (1 − ε, 1 + ε) we deﬁne uλ(t) := u∗(λt). Then uλ ∈ E1(Jε) and
uλ is a solution of the problem

(4.1)

For given λ ∈ (1 − ε, 1 + ε) we solve the problem

∂νv + β∂νvt = g(λ),
(v(0), vt(0)) = (u0, λu1),

in Ω,

where g(λ) = 0 if p < 3 and

g(λ) = e∆∂Ωt[∂νu0 + λβ∂ν u1],

if p > 3. By Theorem 2.2 this yields a unique solution v(λ) ∈ E1(Jε). We note on
the go that the mapping [λ 7→ v(λ)] from (1 − ε, 1 + ε) to E1(Jε) is C∞, since the
parameter λ appears only polynomially in the linear problem (4.2).

Choose ε > 0 and k(u0, u1)kXγ suﬃciently small such that

λ∈(1−ε,1+ε)(cid:18)max

sup

t∈Jε ku∗(λt)k∞ + max

t∈Jε k[v(λ)](t)k∞(cid:19) <

This is always possible by estimate (2.8) and by the continuous dependence of
u∗ on (u0, u1) (which is uniform w.r.t. T ). Note that u∗ = 0 if (u0, u1) = 0, by
uniqueness of the solution of (1.4).

Let 0W(Jε) be as in (3.3) with J being replaced by Jε and deﬁne a mapping

H : (1 − ε, 1 + ε) × 0W(Jε) → E0(Jε) × 0F(Jε) by

H(λ, u) :=(cid:20)c−2(u + v(λ))tt − λ2∆(u + v(λ)) − λβ∆(u + v(λ))t − γ[(u + v(λ))2]tt

WESTERVELT EQUATION WITH ABSORBING BOUNDARY CONDITIONS

13

Since [λ 7→ v(λ)] is C∞ it follows that H ∈ C∞ in (λ, u) as well. Furthermore it
holds that H(1, u∗ − v(1)) = 0 and

by Proposition 3.1. A Neumann series argument implies that

DuH(1, u∗ − v(1)) : 0E1(Jε) → E0(Jε) × 0F(Jε)

is invertible, provided that the norm ku∗kE1(Jε) is suﬃciently small. This follows
readily by decreasing k(u0, u1)kXγ if necessary.
By the implicit function theorem there exists r ∈ (0, ε) and a unique mapping
φ ∈ C∞((1 − r, 1 + r); 0W(Jε)) such that H(λ, φ(λ)) = 0 for all λ ∈ (1 − r, 1 + r)
and φ(1) = u∗ − v(1). From the uniqueness it follows that uλ = φ(λ) + v(λ), hence

[λ 7→ uλ] ∈ C∞((1 − r, 1 + r); E1(Jε)).

Since ∂λuλ(t) = t ˙u∗(λt) one computes inductively that

[t 7→ tku(k)

∗ (t)] ∈ E1(J)

for each k ∈ N0. Note that one may pass to the limit ε → 0, since one evaluates
the above derivatives at λ = 1. In particular, this yields

We have thus proven the following result.

5. Long-Time Behaviour

In this section we assume that p > d + 1. Note that as long as |u(t, x)| < 1
all (t, x) ∈ (0, T ) × Ω we can rewrite (1.4) as the ﬁrst order system

where w = (u, v) = (u, ut),

To study the stability properties of such an equilibrium, we consider the full lin-
earization of (5.1) and (5.2) in (r, 0) ∈ E. This yields a linear operator A0 deﬁned

By Theorem 2.2 the operator A0 has the property of maximal Lp-regularity on each
bounded interval [0, T ]. Therefore A0 is the generator of an analytic C0-semigroup
in X0, see e.g. [21, Proposition 1.2] or [5, Theorem 2.2].

In what follows, we will investigate the spectrum σ(A0) of A0. Note that D(A0)
is not compactly embedded into X0, hence we cannot work with a compact resol-
vent of A0. In a ﬁrst step we show that the inclusion
− ∪ {0},

σapp(A0) ⊂ C

holds for the approximate point spectrum σapp(A0) of A0. Clearly, λ = 0 is an
eigenvalue of A0 with the corresponding eigenspace

{(u, v) ∈ X1 : u is constant and v = 0}.

In case that q1 < p, we obtain (by Sobolev embedding

In case

such that qk ≥ p or 2s − d/qk−1 ≥ 0, which allows us to follow the lines of

We have shown that if λ ∈ σapp(A0), then λ = 0 or Re λ < 0. Now it is well-known
that for the topological boundary ∂σ(A0) of the spectrum of A0 it holds that

∂σ(A0) ⊂ σapp(A0),

see e.g. [6, Proposition IV.1.10]. Assume that there exists λ ∈ σ(A0) with Re λ > 0.
Then it follows that ∂σ(A0)∩C+ 6= ∅, since A0 generates an analytic C0-semigroup
− ∪ {0} and therefore it holds
in X0. But this is impossible, since σapp(A0) ⊂ C
that

Suppose that there exists λ ∈ σ(A0) such that Re λ = 0 and λ 6= 0. Then
λ ∈ ∂σ(A0) ⊂ σapp(A0) which is a contradiction. This shows that

We claim that λ = 0 ∈ σ(A0) is semi-simple, i.e. R(A0) is closed in X0 and

X0 = N (A0) ⊕ R(A0).

Let f = (g, h) ∈ R(A0) ⊂ X0. Then there exists w = (u, v) ∈ D(A0) such that
A0w = f or equivalently v = g, ∆u + β∆v = c2
rh in Ω and ∂ν (u + βv) + crv = 0

on ∂Ω; recall that cr = pc−2 − 2γr > 0. Integrating the second equation w.r.t

x ∈ Ω yields

R(A0) =(cid:26)(g, h) ∈ X0 : crZΩ

gdσ = 0(cid:27) .

This in turn implies that R(A0) is closed in X0. Let f = (g, h) ∈ X0 be given.
Then we may write (g, h) = (k, 0) + (g − k, h), where
(5.6)

k :=

With this choice it follows that (g−k, h) ∈ R(A0) and (of course) (k, 0) ∈ N (A0) =
span{1}×{0}. Deﬁne a mapping P : X0 → X0 by P (g, h) := (k, 0) where k is given
by (5.6). It is easily seen that P is a continuous projection with N (P ) = R(A0)
and R(P ) = N (A0). Therefore it holds that X0 = N (A0) ⊕ R(A0), hence λ = 0 is
semi-simple.
We are now in a position to follow the lines of the proof of [23, Theorem 3.1] to
obtain the following result on the qualitative behaviour of the solution of (1.4) in
