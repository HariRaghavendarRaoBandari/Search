TORSION-FREE RANK ONE SHEAVES OVER DEL PEZZO ORDERS

NORBERT HOFFMANN AND FABIAN REEDE

Abstract. Let A be a del Pezzo order on the projective plane over the ﬁeld of complex
numbers. We prove that every torsion-free A-module of rank one can be deformed into
a locally free A-module of rank one.

Introduction

An order on an algebraic variety X is a torsion-free coherent sheaf of OX-algebras whose
generic stalk is a central division algebra over the function ﬁeld of X. A surface together
with an order on it can be thought of as a noncommutative surface. In this article we are
interested in terminal del Pezzo orders on the projective plane P2 over the ﬁeld of complex
numbers C. These orders are noncommutative analogues of classical del Pezzo surfaces
and have been completely classiﬁed by D. Chan and C. Ingalls in the course of their proof
of the minimal model program for orders over surfaces, see [CI05].

Let A be a terminal del Pezzo order on P2. Left A-modules which are locally free
and generically of rank one can be thought of as line bundles on this noncommutative
surface. There is a quasi-projective coarse moduli scheme for these line bundles [HS05],
a noncommutative analogue of the classical Picard scheme. To compactify this moduli
scheme, that is to get a projective moduli scheme, one has to allow torsion-free left A-
modules which are generically of rank one.

We study the boundary of this compactiﬁcation by studying the deformation theory of

torsion-free A-modules. The main result of this article is the following

Theorem. Let A 6= OP2 be a terminal del Pezzo order on P2 over C. Then every torsion-
free A-module E of rank one can be deformed to a locally free A-module E′.

As a corollary, we obtain that every irreducible component of the compactiﬁcation of

the noncommutative Picard scheme contains a point deﬁned by an A-line bundle.

The structure of this paper is as follows. We review the deﬁnition and some basic facts
about terminal del Pezzo orders in section 1. In section 2 we study in detail the local
deformation theory of A-modules in this setting. We look at the homological algebra
of torsion-free A-modules and study the compactiﬁcation of the noncommutative Picard
scheme and some of its properties in section 3. In the ﬁnal section 4 we study the global
deformation theory and prove the main result.

1. Noncommutative del Pezzo surfaces

Let X be a smooth projective surface over C.

Deﬁnition 1.1. An order A on X is sheaf of associative OX -algebras such that

• A is coherent and torsion-free as an OX -module, and
• the stalk Aη at the generic point η ∈ X is a central division ring over the function

ﬁeld C(X) = OX,η of X.

We can now look at all orders in Aη and order them by inclusion. A maximal element
will be called a maximal order. These are the algebras we are interested in. Maximal
orders have some nice properties, for example they are locally free OX-modules.

Furthermore, it is well known that there is a largest open subset U ⊂ X on which A
is even an Azumaya algebra, see for example [Tan81, Proposition 6.2]. The complement
D := X \ U is called the ramiﬁcation locus of A. It is the union of ﬁnitely many curves
C ⊂ X, and contains valuable informations about the order A.

The ramiﬁcation of a maximal order A can be seen in the Artin-Mumford sequence:

Theorem 1.2 ([Tan81, Lemma 4.1]). Let X be a smooth projective surface over C. Then
there is a canonical exact sequence

0 −−−−→ Br(X) −−−−→ Br(C(X)) −−−−→

H1(C(C), Q/Z).

LC⊂X

irreducible curve

Here the Galois cohomology group H1(C(C), Q/Z) classiﬁes isomorphism classes of
cyclic extensions of C(C). The ramiﬁcation curves are exactly the curves where the Brauer
class of Aη has nontrivial image in H1(C(C), Q/Z). Thus every ramiﬁcation curve C comes
with a ﬁnite cyclic ﬁeld extension L/C(C). The degree eC := [L : C(C)] is called the ram-
iﬁcation index of A at C.

We are interested in a special class of maximal orders on X, the so called terminal
orders. To give a deﬁnition of terminal orders, let e, e′ and f be positive integers such
that e′ divides e. We look at the complete local ring R = C[[u, v]] and deﬁne

S := Rhx, yi with the relations xe′

= u, ye′

= v and yx = ζxy

where ζ is a primitive e′-th root of unity. Then S is of ﬁnite rank over R, the center of S
is R, and the tensor product S ⊗R K with the ﬁeld of fractions K := Quot(R) is a division
ring. Deﬁne the following R-subalgebra:

(1)

B :=

⊂ Me/e′(S)



· · ·

S
xS
...
. . .
xS · · ·

· · · S
...
. . .
...
. . .
xS S




Then we deﬁne the R-algebra A as a full matrix algebra over B:

(2)
Note that the algebra A = Ae,e′,f depends on the integers e, e′ and f . The following
theorem describes some of its properties:

A := Mf (B).

Theorem 1.3 ([CI05, Proposition 2.8]). Let A = Ae,e′,f be the R-algebra deﬁned by (2).

i) A has global dimension two.
ii) If e = e′ = 1, then A is unramiﬁed.
iii) If e > e′ = 1, then A is ramiﬁed on u = 0, with ramiﬁcation index e.
iv) If e′ > 1, then A is ramiﬁed on uv = 0, with ramiﬁcation index e on u = 0, and

with ramiﬁcation index e′ on v = 0.

Deﬁnition 1.4 ([CI05, Corollary 4.3]). A maximal order A on a smooth projective surface
X over C is called terminal if and only if for every closed point p ∈ X there is

• an isomorphism of complete local rings bOX,p ∼= C[[u, v]], and
• a C[[u, v]]-algebra isomorphism Ap ⊗ bOX,p ∼= Ae,e′,f for some integers e, e′ and f .

Deﬁnition 1.5 ([CK03, Lemma 8]). Assume A is a terminal order on a smooth projective
surface X over C, with ramiﬁcation curves {Ci} and ramiﬁcation indices {ei}. Then we
deﬁne the canonical divisor class KA of A by:

KA = KX +X(1 −

)Ci.

Lemma 1.6. If A is a terminal order on a smooth projective surface X over C, then

KA = KX −

Proof. Theorem 1.83 in [Ree13] states that c1(A) = −

(cid:3)

Deﬁnition 1.7 ([CK03, Deﬁnition 7, Lemma 8]). A terminal order A on a smooth pro-
jective surface X over C is called a del Pezzo order if −KA is ample.

If A is a terminal del Pezzo order on P2, then its ramiﬁcation is rather limited:

Proposition 1.8 ([CI05, Proposition 3.21]). Assume A is a terminal del Pezzo order on

P2 with ramiﬁcation locus D = S Ci and ramiﬁcation indices {ei}. Then all ramiﬁcation

indices ei are equal, and we have 3 ≤ deg(D) ≤ 5.

Furthermore there are more constraints for the common ramiﬁcation index e ∈ N de-

pending on the degree of D, see for example [CI05, Proposition 3.21].

2. Punctual deformations of rank one modules

In this section we study the local situation. That is we replace the surface X over C by

the complete local ring R = C[[u, v]], and the terminal order A on X by the R-algebra

A = Ae,e′,f

deﬁned in (2). The role of dualizing sheaf will be played by the A-bimodule

A∗ := Hom(A, R).

Left ideals I ⊂ A of R-colength l < ∞ are parameterized by the punctual Hilbert scheme

HilbA(l),

which is a closed subscheme of the punctual Quot-scheme QuotR(A, l) and hence projective
over C. We say that I can be deformed to another left ideal I ′ ⊂ A if I ′ has the same
colength l < ∞, and lies in the same connected component of HilbA(l).

Equivalently, I ⊂ A can be deformed to I ′ ⊂ A if and only if there is a sheaf of left
ideals I ⊂ AT := A ⊗C OT for some connected scheme T over C such that AT /I is ﬂat
over OT , and I has ﬁbers It = I and It′ = I ′ for some points t, t′ ∈ T (C).

We consider three diﬀerent cases, depending on the ramiﬁcation of A.

2.1. No ramiﬁcation: e = e′ = 1. In this case, A = Mf (R) is a full matrix algebra over
R = C[[u, v]]. We assume f > 1.

Lemma 2.1. Every proper left ideal I ⊂ A of ﬁnite colength can be deformed to a proper
left ideal I ′ ⊂ A of ﬁnite colength such that I ′A∗ 6⊆ A∗I ′.
Proof. The left ideal I ⊂ A is Morita equivalent to an R-submodule M ⊂ Rf of some
colength l < ∞. Choose an ideal J ⊂ R of colength l. Then the R-submodule

(3)
is Morita equivalent to some left ideal I ′ ⊂ A. Since the punctual Quot-scheme

M ′ := J ⊕ Rf −1 ⊂ Rf

QuotR(Rf , l)

is irreducible according to [EL99, Proposition 6], M ⊂ Rf can be deformed to M ′ ⊂ Rf .
Therefore I ⊂ A can be deformed to I ′ ⊂ A. It remains to prove I ′A∗ 6⊆ A∗I ′.

Assume for contradiction that I ′A∗ ⊆ A∗I ′. Then I ′A ⊆ AI ′, because A∗ ∼= A as
A-bimodules by means of the trace form A ⊗R A → R. Hence I ′ is a two-sided ideal.
Consequently, I ′ = Mf (J ′) for some ideal J ′ ⊂ R. Therefore,

M ′ = (J ′)f ⊂ Rf .

Since f > 1, this contradicts (3). Hence indeed I ′A∗ 6⊆ A∗I ′.

2.2. Smooth ramiﬁcation: e > e′ = 1. In this case, our algebra A = Ae,1,f over
R = C[[u, v]] is ramiﬁed over u = 0, with ramiﬁcation index e. Explicitly, we have
A = Mf (B) for

(4)

B =

⊂ Me(R).

uR R

uR · · · uR R




The aim of this subsection is to prove an analogue of Lemma 2.1 in this situation.
We have A∗ = Mf (B∗) for the B-bimodule B∗ := HomR(B, R). The trace map

tr : BK := B ⊗K R = Me(K) → K

allows us to identify B∗ with the set of all b ∈ BK for which tr(bB) ⊆ R; explicitly,

B∗ =




...



. . .
. . . u−1R
R
· · ·

R
...
R

⊂ BK = Me(K).

In particular, B∗ = b∗B = Bb∗ and A∗ = b∗A = Ab∗ for the matrix

(5)

b∗ :=





where elements of A = Mf (B) are multiplied componentwise by b∗ ∈ B∗.

We see from (4) that B has exactly e two-sided maximal ideals mi, given by replacing
R by its maximal ideal m in the diagonal entry (i, i) respectively. So there are also exactly
e non-isomorphic simple B-modules Si := B/mi. We have
and B∗ ⊗B Si ∼= Si−1

B∗ ⊗B S1 ∼= Se

for i ≥ 2,

because b∗m1 = meb∗ and b∗mi = mi−1b∗ for i ≥ 2, as is easily checked. Using Morita
equivalence, we see that there are e simple left A-modules, all of R-length f .

Corollary 2.2. HilbA(l) is nonempty if and only if f divides l.
Lemma 2.3. Let I ⊂ A be a left ideal such that IA∗ ⊆ A∗I. Then I is a two-sided ideal.
In particular, I = Mf (J) for some two-sided ideal J ⊂ B such that JB∗ ⊆ B∗J .
Proof. Let b∗ ∈ B∗ still be the matrix given by (5). The ﬁnitely generated R-modules A/I
and A∗/A∗I = b∗A/b∗I are isomorphic, as b∗ is invertible in Me(K). The R-linear map

φ : A/I → A∗/A∗I,

a + I 7→ ab∗ + A∗I

is well-deﬁned since Ib∗ ⊆ A∗I by assumption, and surjective since Ab∗ = A∗. Therefore,
φ is also injective, according to [Mat89, Theorem 2.4]. Since φ is by deﬁnition A-linear
from the left, and IA∗ ⊆ A∗I by assumption, we conclude that IA ⊆ I.
(cid:3)
Lemma 2.4. Let J ⊂ B be a left ideal such that JB∗ ⊆ B∗J . Then

Proof. Since Lemma 2.3 applies to J ⊂ B, it shows that J is a two-sided ideal in B. We
denote the standard basis elements of the free R-module B by

(7)

bi,j ∈ Me(R),

1 ≤ i, j ≤ e.

In other words, the matrix bi,j has a single nonzero entry in row i and column j, which is
1 for i ≤ j and u for i > j. Since J is two-sided, we have bi,iJbj,j ⊆ J, and therefore

for some ideals Ji,j ⊆ R. As b1,1 + b2,2 + · · · + be,e = 1 in B, we conclude that

bi,iJbj,j = Ji,jbi,j

J =

⊂ Me(R).

Using this description, the other assumption Jb∗ ⊆ b∗J directly implies

Ji,e ⊆ Ji+1,1 ⊆ Ji+2,2 ⊆ · · · ⊆ Je,e−i ⊆ J1,e−i+1 ⊆ J2,e−i+2 ⊆ · · · ⊆ Ji,e

for i = 1, . . . , e. Hence these inclusions are all equalities, and (6) holds with Ji := Ji,e.
Using (6), the assumption J ⊇ b1,2J directly implies J1 ⊇ J2 ⊇ · · · ⊇ Je ⊇ uJ1.
(cid:3)

Proposition 2.5. Every proper left ideal I ⊂ A of ﬁnite colength can be deformed to a
proper left ideal I ′ ⊂ A of ﬁnite colength such that I ′A∗ 6⊆ A∗I ′.

Proof. We may assume IA∗ ⊆ A∗I, since otherwise there is nothing to prove. Using
Lemma 2.3 and Lemma 2.4, we get I = Mf (J) with J ⊂ B given by (6) for some ideals

R ⊇ J1 ⊇ J2 ⊇ · · · ⊇ Je

of ﬁnite colength, not all equal to R, such that Je ⊇ uJ1. It suﬃces to deform J to a left
ideal J ′ ⊂ B such that J ′B∗ 6⊆ B∗J ′. Changing J only in the ﬁrst row, we will take

J ′ =

for some ideals J ′

1, . . . , J ′

e ⊆ R, chosen as follows.

Suppose that J1 = · · · = Je. Since mJe 6= Je by Nakayama’s lemma, the vector space

Je/mJe over R/m = C has a one-dimensional quotient. Hence we can ﬁnd an ideal

J ′
e ⊆ Je with Je/J ′
e

∼= C as R-modules.

Since J1 6= R by assumption, the R-module R/J1 of ﬁnite length has a simple submodule,
which is necessarily isomorphic to R/m = C. Hence we can ﬁnd an ideal

1 ⊇ J1 with J ′
J ′

1/J1 ∼= C as R-modules.

Finally, we take J ′

i = Ji for i 6= e, 1 in this case.

Now suppose that J1 = · · · = Je is not true. Choose an index m with Jm 6= Jm+1. Then
the R-module Jm/Jm+1 of ﬁnite length has a simple submodule and a simple quotient,
which are both necessarily isomorphic to R/m = C. Hence we can ﬁnd two ideals

Jm ⊇ J ′

m, J ′
Finally, we take J ′

m+1 ⊇ Jm+1 with Jm/J ′
m
i = Ji for i 6= m, m + 1 in this case.

m+1/Jm+1

as R-modules.

To show that the R-submodule J ′ ⊆ B deﬁned by (8) is a left ideal, we check that the
basis elements bi,j ∈ B in (7) satisfy bi,jJ ′ ⊆ J ′. This clearly holds for i = j = 1, and also
for i, j ≥ 2 because J is a left ideal. In each of the two cases considered above, the ideals
1, . . . , J ′
J ′

e ⊆ R satisfy by construction

Ji ⊆ J ′

This directly implies b1,2J ′ ⊆ J ′. Similarly, J ′
i ≥ 2,

1 ⊆ Je.

1, . . . , J ′

e also satisfy by construction

This directly implies be,1J ′ ⊆ J ′. Using b1,i = b1,2b2,i and bi,1 = bi,ebe,1 for i ≥ 2, we
conclude that that J ′ ⊆ B is indeed a left ideal.

Since J ′ is by construction not of the form (6), Lemma 2.4 shows that J ′B∗ 6⊆ B∗J ′. It

remains to prove that J can be deformed to J ′.

The left B-modules J/(J ∩J ′) and J ′/(J ∩J ′) are, by construction of J ′, both isomorphic

to the simple module S1 = B/m1. Consequently, the sum J + J ′ ⊆ B satisﬁes

J + J ′
J ∩ J ′

∼=

J

J ∩ J ′ ⊕

J ′

J ∩ J ′

∼= S1 ⊕ S1 ∼= C2

where all these B-modules are C-vector spaces because B acts on them via B ։ B/m1 ∼= C.
We consider the P1 of lines in this C2. The universal quotient

C2 ⊗C OP1 ։ OP1(1)
over this P1 gives rise to a family of B-module quotients

(J + J ′) ⊗C OP1 ։ OP1(1).

Its kernel J ⊂ B ⊗C OP1 restricts to J over [1 : 0] ∈ P1, and to J ′ over [0 : 1] ∈ P1.
Therefore, J is the required deformation of J to J ′.
(cid:3)

2.3. Singular ramiﬁcation with equal ramiﬁcation indices: e = e′ > 1. In this
case, our algebra A = Ae,e,f over R = C[[u, v]] is ramiﬁed over u = 0 and over v = 0, with
common ramiﬁcation index e. Explicitly, we have A = Mf (S) for

S = Rhx, yi with the relations xe = u, ye = v and yx = ζxy

where ζ is a primitive e-th root of unity. The ring S is local in the sense that it has a
unique two-sided maximal ideal n ⊂ S, which is generated by x and y.

In this situation, the analogue of Lemma 2.1 is no longer true; a counterexample is

given by f = 1 and I = n. However, the following fact will suﬃce for our purposes.

Lemma 2.6. HilbA(l) is connected if f divides l, and it is empty otherwise.
Proof. The unique simple S-module S/n ∼= C has R-length one. Therefore, S/n is Morita
equivalent to a unique simple left A-module, whose R-length is f .

Now one can just copy the corresponding part in the proof of [HS05, Theorem 3.6. iii)]
and replace the Quot- and the Flag-scheme by the punctual versions. The main point is
that induction also works in this case, because A has just one simple left module.
(cid:3)

3. Moduli spaces of rank one sheaves

Let A be a terminal order on a smooth projective surface X over C.

Deﬁnition 3.1 ([CK03, Deﬁnition 4]). The canonical bimodule of A is

ωA := HomOX (A, ωX).

Lemma 3.2 ([Ree13, Theorem 1.58]). Let E and F be two OX -coherent left A-modules.
Then there is the following form of Serre duality:
A(E, F ) ∼= Ext2−i
for i ∈ {0, 1, 2}. Here ( )∨ denotes the C-dual.

A (F, ωA ⊗A E)∨

Exti

Lemma 3.3 ([Ree13, Lemma 1.62]). Let E and T be OX -coherent left A-modules such
that E is locally projective and T is an Artinian module of ﬁnite length. Then the map

Ext2

A(T, E) → Ext2

OX (T, E)

induced by the forgetful functor A-mod → OX -mod is injective.

Deﬁnition 3.4. A left A-module E is called a torsion-free A-module of rank one if

TORSION-FREE RANK ONE SHEAVES OVER DEL PEZZO ORDERS

7

• E is coherent and torsion-free as an OX -module, and
• the stalk Eη at the generic point η ∈ X has dimension 1 over the division ring Aη.

Lemma 3.5 ([CC15, Proposition 4.2.]). Let E be a torsion-free A-module of rank one
which is a locally free OX -module, then for every closed point p ∈ X there is an isomor-
phism of completions

Thus E is locally free over A if and only if E is locally free over OX .

bEp ∼= bAp.

Lemma 3.6 ([Ree13, Theorem 1.84]). If E is a torsion-free A-module of rank one, then

c1(A∗ ⊗A E) = c1(E) − 2c1(A)

where A∗ := HomOX (A, OX ) denotes the dual sheaf of A.
Deﬁnition 3.7. A family of torsion-free A-modules of rank one over a C-scheme T is a
left module E under the pullback AT of A to X × T with the following properties:

• E is coherent over OX×T and ﬂat over T ;
• for every t ∈ T , the ﬁber Et is a torsion-free AC(t)-module of rank one.

Here C(t) is the residue ﬁeld of T at t, and the ﬁber is the pullback of E to X × Spec C(t).

Now one can deﬁne the moduli functor

MA/X:P : SchemesC → Sets

which sends a C-scheme T to the set of isomorphism classes of families E of torsion-free
A-modules of rank one over T with Hilbert polynomial P .

Theorem 3.8 ([HS05, Theorem 2.4]). There is a coarse moduli scheme MA/X;P for the
functor MA/X;P . The scheme MA/X;P is of ﬁnite type and projective over C.

Instead of ﬁxing the Hilbert polynomial, one can also ﬁx the Chern classes of these
modules. We will work with the moduli space MA/X;c1,c2 of torsion-free A-modules of
rank one over X with Chern classes c1 ∈ NS(X) and c2 ∈ Z.
Lemma 3.9. Let A be a terminal del Pezzo order on P2 over C. If E and F are torsion-
free A-modules of rank one with c1(E) = c1(F ), then Ext2
Proof. Assume for contradiction that Ext2
states that there is a nonzero map

A(E, F ) 6= 0. Then Serre duality for A-modules

A(E, F ) = 0.

φ : F → ωA ⊗A E.

Since E and F are generically simple and torsion-free, φ is generically bijective and there-
fore injective, and its cokernel is a torsion sheaf. This means that the divisor class

(9)

c1(ωA ⊗A E) − c1(F )

is eﬀective. On the other hand, Deﬁnition 3.1, Lemma 3.6 and Lemma 1.6 imply that

c1(ωA ⊗A E) = c1(A∗ ⊗A E) + rk(A)c1(ωP2)
= c1(E) − 2c1(A) + rk(A)KP2
= c1(E) + rk(A)KA.

Hence the class in (9) equals rk(A)KA. But A is a del Pezzo order, so −KA is ample.
Since Pic(P2) = Z · [O(1)], we conclude that KA and the class in (9) are negative multiples
of [O(1)], and therefore not eﬀective. This contradiction proves Ext2
(cid:3)
Theorem 3.10. If A is a terminal del Pezzo order on P2 over C, then the moduli space
MA/P2;c1,c2 of torsion-free A-modules of rank one with Chern classes c1 and c2 is smooth.
Proof. Let E be a torsion-free A-module of rank one with Chern classes c1 and c2.
Then Ext2
In particular, all obstruction classes
in Ext2
(cid:3)

A(E, E) vanish. This implies that MA/P2;c1,c2 is smooth at the point [E].

A(E, E) = 0 according to Lemma 3.9.

A(E, F ) = 0.

4. Deformations of torsion-free rank one sheaves

Let A be a terminal del Pezzo order of rank n2 > 1 on the projective plane P2 over C.
Let D ⊂ P2 denote the ramiﬁcation divisor. Proposition 1.8 states that A has the same
ramiﬁcation index e at every component of D. We put f := n/e.

Proposition 4.1. Let E be a locally free left A-module of rank one. Let

(10)

π : E ։ T

be a nonzero quotient of ﬁnite length. Then π can be deformed to a nonzero quotient

(11)

π′ : E ։ T ′

of ﬁnite length such that the following induced map is not injective:

(12)

∗ : Ext2
π′

A(T ′, E) → Ext2

A(T ′, T ′)

Proof. Choose p ∈ P2 in the support of T . As T has ﬁnite length, its support is ﬁnite, and

T = Tp ⊕ T6=p

where Tp is supported at p, and T6=p is supported outside p. We distinguish three cases,
depending on the ramiﬁcation of A at p.

The ﬁrst case is that p is a smooth point of the ramiﬁcation divisor D. Let A := bAp
denote the completion of A at p, that is we have A ∼= Ae,1,f . Choosing an isomorphism of
completions given by Lemma 3.5

(13)

bEp ∼= A,

we can identify the quotient Tp of bEp with A/I for some left ideal I ⊂ A of ﬁnite colength.

Proposition 2.5 allows us to deform I to a left ideal I ′ ⊂ A of ﬁnite colength such that

I ′A∗ 6⊆ A∗I ′.

Therefore, Tp can be deformed to T ′
in (10) can be deformed to the quotient

p := A/I ′ as a quotient of A, and the given quotient π

π′ : E ։ T ′ := T ′

p ⊕ T6=p.

To prove that π′
Then the left A-module homomorphism

∗ in (12) is not injective, we choose an element a∗ ∈ A∗ with I ′a∗ 6⊆ A∗I ′.

φ : A → A∗/A∗I ′ = A∗ ⊗A T ′
p,

a 7→ aa∗ + A∗I ′,

does not vanish on I ′, and hence does not factor through A/I ′ = T ′

p. Therefore, the map

HomA(T ′

p, A∗ ⊗A T ′

p) → HomA(A, A∗ ⊗A T ′
p)

induced by the projection A ։ T ′
the identiﬁcation (13) and the decomposition T ′ = T ′

p is not surjective, as its image does not contain φ. Using

p ⊕ T6=p, we conclude that

(π′)∗ : HomA(T ′, ωA ⊗A T ′) → HomA(E, ωA ⊗A T ′)

is not surjective. Hence the map π′

∗ in (12) is not injective, by Serre duality for A-modules.
The second case is that A is unramiﬁed at p. This case is simpler than the ﬁrst case.

However, the same argument works, using Lemma 2.1 instead of Proposition 2.5.

The third case is that p lies in the singular locus Dsing of the ramiﬁcation divisor D.

Let l be the OP2-length of Tp. Then πp : E ։ Tp deﬁnes a point in the scheme

QuotA(E, l)

that classiﬁes left A-module quotients of E with OP2-length l. This is a closed subscheme
of QuotOP2 (E, l), and hence projective over C. It comes with a Hilbert-Chow morphism

(14)

supp : QuotA(E, l) → Syml(P2),

whose ﬁber over l · q for q ∈ P2 is the punctual Hilbert scheme for the completion bAq:

(15)

supp−1(l · q) = Hilb bAq

(l).

For q = p, this ﬁber contains the point Tp, and is therefore non-empty. Using Lemma
2.6, we conclude that f divides l. Hence (15) is non-empty for each ramiﬁed point q ∈ D
by Corollary 2.2. In other words, the image of the morphism supp in (14) contains the
diagonally embedded

D ⊂ P2 ֒→ Syml(P2).

Let ∆ ⊂ D be the ﬁnite set of all points q 6= p in Dsing or in the support of T . Choose an
irreducible component C ⊆ D \ ∆ with p ∈ C. Let Qi be the connected components of

supp−1(C) ⊆ QuotA(E, l).

Since the morphism supp in (14) is projective, the image supp(Qi) is closed in C. But the
union of these images is all of C, which is irreducible. Hence

for some such connected component Qi. Since supp−1(l · p) is connected by Lemma 2.6,
and intersects Qi by construction, it is contained in Qi. In particular, the point given by

supp(Qi) = C

(16)

πp : E ։ Tp

lies in Qi. Now choose a point q 6= p in C, and a quotient

(17)

π′
q : E ։ T ′
q

corresponding to a point in Qi over q. The restriction of the universal quotient to

provides a deformation of the quotient (16) to the quotient (17). Since supp(Qi) = C ⊂ P2
does not intersect the support of T6=p, we can take the direct sum with the component

Qi ⊂ QuotA(E, l)

π6=p : E ։ T6=p

of π to obtain a deformation of the given quotient (10) to the quotient

π′
q ⊕ π6=p : E ։ T ′

q ⊕ T6=p.

As the support of this quotient contains the point q ∈ D \ Dsing, we can apply the ﬁrst
case treated above to deform it further to a quotient (11) with the required property. (cid:3)

Theorem 4.2. Let A 6= OP2 be a terminal del Pezzo order on P2 over C. Then every
torsion-free A-module E of rank one can be deformed to a locally free A-module E′.

Proof. We adapt the proof of [HS05, Theorem 3.6.(iii)] and start with the exact sequence

(18)

0 −−−−→ E

ι

A(T, E)

ι∗−−−−→ Ext2

A(T, E∗∗)

π∗−−−−→ Ext2

A(T, T ) −−−−→ 0.

Applying Proposition 4.1 to the quotient π : E∗∗ ։ T , and replacing E by the kernel of
the resulting deformed quotient π′ : E∗∗ ։ T ′, we may assume that π∗ is not injective.
Then ι∗ 6= 0. The functor HomA( , E) turns (18) into the long exact sequence

. . . −−−−→ Ext1

A(E, E)

A(T, E) −−−−→ Ext2

whose connecting homomorphism ∂ is surjective by Lemma 3.9. Hence the composition

∂−−−−→ Ext2

A(T, E)

ι∗−−−−→ Ext2

A(T, E∗∗)

is nonzero. We choose a class γ ∈ Ext1
A(T, E∗∗) is nonzero.
The inﬁnitesimal deformation of E given by γ can be extended to a deformation E of E
over a smooth connected curve C, since Ext2

A(E, E) whose image in Ext2

A(E, E) = 0 by Lemma 3.9.

NORBERT HOFFMANN AND FABIAN REEDE

Let E′ be the ﬁber of E over a general point of C. Lemma 3.3 states that the forgetful

functor induces an injective map
Ext2

A(T, E∗∗) ֒→ Ext2

OP2 (T, E∗∗).

So the class γ, seen as an element in Ext1

OP2 (T, E∗∗).
We can thus use a result of Artamkin, which says that the length of (E′)∗∗/E′ is strictly
smaller than the length of E∗∗/E, see [Art91, Corollary 1.3]. Using induction over this
length, we may assume that E′ can already be deformed to a locally free A-module. (cid:3)

OP2 (E, E), has nonzero image in Ext2

Corollary 4.3. Every irreducible component of the moduli space MA/P2;c1,c2 contains a
point deﬁned by a locally free A-module.

Proof. Every connected component of MA/P2;c1,c2 contains such a point by Theorem 4.2.
But these connected components are smooth by Theorem 3.10, and hence irreducible. (cid:3)

Corollary 4.4. The open locus M lf

A/P2;c1,c2

of locally free A-modules is dense in MA/X;c1,c2.
