Abstract—The power electronic interface to a vibration energy
harvester not only provides ac-dc conversion, but can also
set the electrical damping to maximize output power under
displacement-constrained operation. This is commonly exploited
for linear two-port harvesters by synchronous switching to realize
a Coulomb-damped resonant generator, but has not been fully
explored when the harvester is asynchronously switched to
emulate a resistive load. In order to understand the potential of
such an approach, the optimal values of load resistance and other
control parameters need to be known. In this paper we determine
analytically the optimal
load and stiffness of a harmonically
driven two-port harvester with displacement constraints. For
weak-coupling devices, we do not ﬁnd any beneﬁt of load and
stiffness adjustment beyond maintaining a saturated power level.
For strong coupling we ﬁnd that the power can be optimized
to agree with the velocity damped generator beyond the ﬁrst
critical force for displacement-constrained operation. This can be
sustained up to a second critical force, determined by a resonator
ﬁgure-of-merit, at which the power ultimately levels out.

I. INTRODUCTION

V IBRATION energy harvesters are of great interest as

power sources for wireless sensors [1]. In addition to
the harvester, its power electronic interface is a central system
component. Even though the electronic interface’s main pur-
pose is ac-dc conversion, it can also serve other purposes such
as effectively increasing the electromechanical coupling [2] or
setting the electrical damping to maximize output power under
different excitations strengths [3]. With a suitable design of the
energy harvester, it is even possible to use the electronics to
adjust the stiffness to adapt the device to different ambient
vibration frequencies [4].

The linear two-port model

is perhaps the most widely
used model for vibration energy harvesters. Under the right
circumstances,
it can describe harvesters of either of the
main transduction types, that is harvesters with electrostatic
[5], [6], piezoelectric [7], [8] or electromagnetic [9], [10]
transduction. A linear two-port harvester with a synchronous
switching power electronic interface such as the synchronous
electric charge extraction (SECE) [11], ideal synchronized
switch harvesting on inductor (SSHI) [2] or synchronous pre-
biasing [12] interface can realize a Coulomb-damped resonant

generator (CDRG) [13]. Hence, these interfaces make it pos-
sible to adjust the electric damping to maximize output power
under displacement-constrained operation as described for the
CDRG in [3].

Asynchronously switched electronic interfaces, such as
buck-boost converters, can appear as an effective load resis-
tance that is determined by the duty cycle of the switching
circuit [14]–[16]. This circuit alternative performs ac-dc con-
version and simultaneously makes possible control of electrical
damping through variation of a load resistance. It can be
modelled by the much studied, harmonically driven, linear
two-port harvester with a resistive load [9], [17], [18]. The
optimal drive frequency and load resistance of this model are
known on closed-form [18].

is equivalent

The resistively loaded two-port model has much in common
with a second order model [19], the velocity damped resonant
generator (VDRG) [3]. It
to the VDRG for
short electrical
time scale [9] and has the same optimal
power for strong coupling. Since the VDRG operating under
a displacement-constraint can perform close to rigorous upper
bounds on power [20], it is of interest to understand also
how an optimal linear two-port model performs under this
constraint. While such an analysis has not yet been carried
out, maximizing the efﬁciency, which amounts to maximizing
the electrical damping, has shown a clear performance beneﬁt
with displacement-constrained operation [21].

In this paper we determine analytically the optimum load
and stiffness of a harmonically driven linear two-port harvester
with displacement constraints. We choose to consider the
optimal stiffness instead of the optimal drive frequency which
would seem to be the more common point of view. This choice
is motivated by the drive frequency normally not being subject
to control in an application, while the (anti-)resonant frequency
of the device is controllable through the stiffness by design
and by electronic means as mentioned in the ﬁrst paragraph.
Since the displacement constraint is enforced by the load and
stiffness tuning only, one might be concerned if there are
detrimental effects of impacts on end-stops in a real device. To
this we take the position that impacts can be avoided by taking
a small margin on the electrically controlled displacement
limit. The mathematical formulation of the problem treat all
three generator types on an equal footing.

II. THE ENERGY HARVESTING SYSTEM

There is a wide range of situations where the dynamic of a
vibration energy harvester is adequately described using only

constitutive equations (1,2) or (3,4). In this circuit the me-
chanical domain is represented in the e− V convention where
the force is an across variable and the velocity is a through
variable [25].

The constitutive equations of the linearized electromagnetic

transducer can be written [22]

one mechanical coordinate. If the harvester in addition has a
single electrical port, we can consider it a two-port device.
If we further restrict to linear devices, the mechanical part of
the device can be characterized by a mass, a damping and a
stiffness related to the coordinate, and with a linear coupling
to the electrical part. The coupling between the electrical and
mechanical domain is then conveniently modelled as a linear
two-port transducer. Such a model is depicted in Fig. 1 where
an inertial mass m is connected to the mechanical port of a
transducer and subject to a parasitic damping with constant
b. When the frame is accelerated, there will be a relative
displacement x between the frame and the mass, and the latter
acts on the transducer with a force FT. The voltage across the
terminals of the electric port is VT and the current into the
positive terminal is IT.

In a notation adapted from [22], the linear two-port equa-
tions for an electrostatic or piezoelectric transducer can be
written

FT = K1x +

where K1 is the open circuit stiffness, C0 is the clamped
capacitance and Γ is the tranduction factor. The quantity q
is the charge, or the deviation in charge from a reference
state, on the positive electrical terminal. Note that there is
an arbitrariness in the choice of independent and dependent
variables. For example, in the piezoelectric litterature it is more
common to write these equations

FT = K0x + ΓVT,
q = −Γx + C0VT

(3)
(4)

where we have introduced the short-circuit stiffness K0 =
K1 − Γ2/C0. Other formulations such as the one with FT
and VT as independent variables are also in use [8]. Which
formulation to choose is entirely a matter of preference, not of
physics. The squared electromechanical coupling factor [24]
is often used to characterize the coupling and is given by

k2 =

Γ2

K1C0

.

(5)

In Fig. 2a the transformer and the two capacitors constitute
an equivalent circuit for a lossless two-port transducer with

where Ψ is the transduction factor, L0 is the clamped in-
ductance and λ is the ﬂux linkage or the deviation in ﬂux
linkage from the reference state. In this case, the stiffnes K1
must be interpreted as the short-circuit stiffness. There is an
open-circuit stiffness given by K0 = K1 − Ψ2/L0 and the
electromechanical coupling factor is

k2 =

Ψ2

K1L0

.

(8)

Since the structure of (1,2) and (6,7) are the same, with
ﬂux linkage and charge playing the same role, the topology
of Fig. 2a could be used as an equivalent circuit also for the
electromagnetic transducer. However, due to the interchange
of the roles of current and charge, it is more convenient to
choose an alternative such as the circuit in Fig. 2b. This circuit
is made in the f − V convention where the velocity is treated
as an across variable and the forces are through variables.

Augmenting the transducer equivalent circuits with mass,
damping and a force, we obtain the conventional equivalent
circuit representations of linear two-port harvesters in Fig.
3. Despite the apparent differences, the two topologies are
connected by a duality relationship which results in similar

it is possible to express the output power of all the three
different architectures on the same form.

We have denoted the highest mechanical stiffness by K1
and the lowest by K0 for all three transduction types. The
corresponding undamped angular resonant frequencies are

then ω1 = (cid:112)K1/m and ω0 = (cid:112)K0/m, and the Q-factors

are Q0 = mω0/b and Q1 = mω1/b. The stiffness constants
are related by K0 = (1 − k2)K1 with the respective k2
for the two cases. Note that 0 ≤ k2 ≤ 1. Some authors
prefer to quantify coupling instead through the coupling factor
e = k2/(1 − k2) ∈ [0,∞) which is sometimes referred
k2
to as the expedient coupling factor [26] or the generalized
electromechanical coupling factor [21].

With a time harmonic drive force F (t) = F0 cos ωt of angu-
lar frequency ω and a resistance R connected to the electrical
ports in Fig. 3, the output power for both architectures can be
written

have buried the differences between the generator types in the
parameter deﬁnitions so that a single analysis can cover all
three types.

III. OPTIMUM LOAD AND STIFFNESS

We now maximize the power (9) with respect to the stiffness
K1 and electrical time constant τ under the constraint that
|X0| ≤ XL for a displacement limit XL. We ﬁrst treat the
case of weak excitations such that
limit
is not reached. The stationary points of the power are then
determined by ∂P/∂K1 = 0 and ∂P/∂τ = 0. The former
equation reduces to

the displacement

K1 = mω2 +

1 + ω2τ 2

which can be used to simplify the latter equation to
(1 − ω2τ 2)[b(1 + ω2τ 2) − ∆Kτ ] = 0.

From the ﬁrst factor, one solution is ωτ = 1 leading to K1 =
mω2 + ∆K/2 and

We note that the power expression (15) has a maximum at
M = 2 and that this maximum is P = F 2
0 /8b which is the
largest possible power these generators can provide.

The other factor in (14) leads to the solution

ωτ = M/2 ±(cid:112)(M/2)2 − 1,
M ∓ √

K1 = mω2 + ∆K

(18)
This solution is only real for M ≥ 2 and always gives output
power P = F 2
0 /8b. The previous solution with lower power
applies for M ≤ 2.

.

The parameter M is a resonator ﬁgure of merit [27]. From
(5) and (8), we have that ∆K = k2K1 and we can write
M = k2Q1ω1/ω or M = k2
e Q0ω0/ω. For moderate coupling
ω1 ≈ ω0 and usually ω ≈ ω0/1, so M is approximately k2
e Q0
or k2Q1 which have been commonly used to distinguish the
low-coupling from the high-coupling regime.

The displacement amplitude at the optimal stiffness (13) is

given by

Inserting (17), we can ﬁnd the critical force Fc that makes
X0 = XL for the optimized strong-coupling case M ≥ 2 to
be

which is smaller than (20) due to the smaller electrical

We now consider forcing that is stronger than the relevant
critical force, (20) or (22). In this case we need to ﬁnd the
optimal values of stiffness and electrical time scale under the
constraint |X0| = XL which we can enforce with a Lagrange
multiplier λ. That is, we look for the optimum among the
values of K1, τ and λ that make

From the ﬁrst of these equations we can distinguish two
different cases based on which of the two factors are zero:
Case A where ∂|X0|2/∂K1 = 0 and Case B where λ =
(∆K/2)ω2τ /(1 + ω2τ 2).

For Case A, (24) reduces to (13) while (25) determines the
value of λ which is of little concern. Therefore we are left
with (26) in which we insert (13) to obtain

We note that these solutions are only real if (1 − M/2)/2 ≤
F0/Fc ≤ (1 + M/2)/2. The upper of the limits is equal to the
critical limit (22) for displacement limitation when coupling is
weak, i.e. when M < 2. Hence these solutions are not optimal
for weak coupling, but can be for high coupling. The lower
limit is negative for strong coupling, so the actual lower limit
will be critical force for displacement limitation Fc in (20),

Considering Case B, the second term on the l.h.s. of (25) is
zero by assumption. For the remaining ﬁrst term to be zero as
required, we must have ωτ = 1. When this result is inserted
into the expression (10) for X0 and (26) is used, we obtain
an equation for the stiffness that can be solved to yield

power, there is, dependent on whether M < 2 or not, either
one force range of quadratic power-dependence on forcing
(I), or one range of quadratic (II) followed by linear (III)
dependency on forcing. The domain-(I) and -(II) distinction
is similar to the bifurcation in [18]. The powers in domains
(II) and (III) are identical to the VDRG power [3].

The energy harvester effectiveness EH [1] is a useful and in-
creasingly used ﬁgure of merit for vibration energy harvesters.
It is deﬁned as the energy harvester output power divided
by the maximum output power of a VDRG without parasitic
losses. Hence it tells how good a harvester is compared to an
ideal. It is generally different from the efﬁciency which is the
ratio of ouput power to input power. In our notation here, we
can write EH = P Fc/2PcF0. The effectiveness is listed for
the different domains of optimal operation in Table I. Despite
of efﬁciency and effectiveness being different quantities, they
coincide in some of the cases due to the similarity between
the two-port model and the VDRG that it is compared to. The
maximum value of effectiveness is found along the border to
domain (IV) and is

max EH =

M

M + 2

(35)

which is dependent only on the resonator ﬁgure of merit. In
particular, it is independent of the displacement limit.

IV. THE EFFECT OF PARASITIC RESISTANCES

Parasitic conductive paths or series resistances are some-
times important, e.g, piezoelectric devices may have non-
negligible leakage currents [28] and electromagnetic devices
can be prone to coil series resistances [10]. We account
for these parasitics by considering, for the electrostatic and
piezoelectric devices (Fig.3a), a total resistance R on the
output port that is constituted by a load resistance RL in
parallel with a parasitic resistor RP. For the electromagnetic
devices (Fig.3b), we consider instead a parasitic resistance RP
in series with the load resistance. The overall time constant
τ is then given by (11) or (12) with R now being the total
resistance. Parametrizing by respectively τP = RPC0 and
τP = L0/RP for the two cases, the output power delivered
to the load resistance can be written as

(36)
Note that τ ∈ [0, τP] and that letting τP → ∞ recovers the
case without stray parasitic resistances.
The power (36) is more difﬁcult

to optimize than the
previous case (9), but for displacement-constrained operation,

Fig. 5 shows high-coupling examples of optimized solu-
tions. The solutions with parasitics (ﬁnite ωτP) are obtained
by combining (37-43) with numerical optimization of (36).
The numerical optimization consists in inserting (13), which
is still valid with the modiﬁed deﬁnition of τ, into (36) and
maximizing the resulting function with respect to τ for the
cases with |X0| ≤ XL. The maximization is acccomplished
using optimization methods in the SciPy module [29] of the
Python programming language. The optimal stiffness is given
in terms of δk = (K1 − mω2)/ωb. The parasitic resistances
inﬂuence the optimum for all ranges of acceleration, but have
most severe effects under displacement-limited operation. Note
that the two equivalent optima for ωτP = ∞ reduce to one for
a ﬁnite ωτP and that this solution is the one with the smallest
time-constant, which is also seen in experiments [28].

V. CONCLUDING REMARKS

We investigated the optimal choice of stiffness and load
resistance for two-port energy harvesters driven by harmonic
vibrations. Even without displacement constraints in effect, the
results differ from previous works because stiffness was varied
rather than the drive frequency. A complete optimization
encompassing the displacement-limited operating regime was
made analytically and an operating chart established. The
normalized output power as a function of normalized force has

only one parameter, the resonator ﬁgure of merit M, which
also determines the maximum energy harvester effectiveness.
If displacement-limits are in effect, the ﬁgure of merit should
be as large as possible in order to maximize power, otherwise
it need only exceed a threshold value of M ≥ 2. The analytical
expressions obtained for the effects of stray conductive paths
or series resistances makes quantiﬁcation of these performance
degrading factors simple. The results of this paper can be used
to judge the merit of energy harvesters with a linear two-port
architecture and act as design guidance when using electric
control of load and stiffness to design energy harvesting
systems that operate effectively.
