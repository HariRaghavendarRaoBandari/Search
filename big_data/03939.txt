On the Stanley depth of a special class of Borel type ideals

Mircea Cimpoea¸s

Abstract

We give sharp bounds for the Stanley depth of a special class of ideals of Borel
type. In particular, given a graphic sequence D, using the Havel-Hakimi process, we
associate a monomial ideal of Borel type, denoted by I(D), and we give bounds for
its Stanley depth.
Keywords: ideal of Borel type, Stanley depth, graphic sequence, Havel-Hakimi the-
orem.

Introduction

Let K be a ﬁeld and S = K[x1, . . . , xn] the polynomial ring over K. Let M be a Zn-
graded S-module. A Stanley decomposition of M is a direct sum D : M = Lr
i=1 miK[Zi]
of Zn-graded K-vector spaces, where mi ∈ M is homogeneous with respect to Zn-grading,
Zi ⊂ {x1, . . . , xn} such that miK[Zi] = {umi : u ∈ K[Zi]} ⊂ M is a free K[Zi]-submodule
of M. We deﬁne sdepth(D) = mini=1,...,r |Zi| and sdepth(M) = max{sdepth(D)| D is a
Stanley decomposition of M}. The number sdepth(M) is called the Stanley depth of M.
Stanley conjectured in [22] that sdepth(M) ≥ depth(M) for any M. The conjecture was
disproved in [11] for M = S/I, where I ⊂ S is a monomial ideal, but remains open in the
case M = I. Herzog, Vladoiu and Zheng show in [18] that sdepth(M) can be computed in a
ﬁnite number of steps if M = I/J, where J ⊂ I ⊂ S are monomial ideals. In [21], Rinaldo
give a computer implementation for this algorithm, in the computer algebra system CoCoA
[10]. For a friendly introduction in the thematic of Stanley depth, we refer the reader [15].
We say that a monomial ideal I ⊂ S is a of Borel type, see [17], if it satisﬁes the following
j ) = (I : (x1, . . . , xj)∞), (∀)1 ≤ j ≤ n. The Mumford-Castelnuovo
condition: (I : x∞
regularity of I, is the number reg(I) = max{j − i : βij(I) 6= 0}, where βij’s are the graded
Betti numbers. The regularity of the ideals of Borel type was extensively studied, see for
instance [17], [3], [1] and [7]. In the ﬁrst section, we study the invariant sdepth(I), for an
ideal of Borel type. In the general case, we note some bounds for sdepth(I), see Proposition
1.2 and we give some tighter ones, when I has a special form, see Theorem 1.6.

In the second section, we consider D = {d1, . . . , dn}, a non-increasing sequence of
non-negative integers. The sequence D is called graphic, if there exists a simple graph
G = (V, E) on the set of vertices V = [n] = {1, . . . , n} and the set of edges E, such that
D = D(G), where D(G) is the sequence of degrees of each vertex of G in non-increasing
order. Havel [14] and Hakimi [13] proved that a sequence D = {d1, . . . , dn} is graphic, if
and only if the sequence D1 := {d2 − 1, d3 − 1, . . . , dd1+1 − 1, dd1+2, . . . , dn} is graphic. D1
is called the Havel-Hakimi derivative of D.

The Havel-Hakimi process, works as follows: Let D be a graphic sequence. Let D1 be
the Havel-Hakimi derivative of D. For i ≤ 2 ≤ m, let Di be the Havel-Hakimi derivative of
Di−1, where m ≤ n−1 is the ﬁrst index for which Dm is the empty set, or the largest element
of Dm is non-positive. As a consequence of the Havel-Hakimi Theorem, the sequence D is
graphic if and only if Dm contains only zeroes. The number of zeroes in Dm is called the
residue of D and is denoted by R(D), see [12] for further details.

I. Anwar, A. Khalid and H. Mahmood [2] introduced a class of Borel type ideals,
associated to graphs, called the elimination ideals, and studied their stability properties
and regularity. See also [1] for further details on the stability of ideals of Borel type. In
our paper, we introduce a similar construction: given a graphic sequence D, we associate
a monomial ideal I(D) ⊂ S, which we call the Havel-Hakimi ideal, see Deﬁnition 2.1. We
note that I(D) is an ideal of Borel type, see Proposition 2.2, and, using the results from the
ﬁrst section, we compute several algebraic invariants of it, see Theorem 2.3. We conclude
our paper with a list of examples, see Example 2.5.

1 Stanley depth of ideals of Borel type

First, we recall the construction of the sequential chain associated to a Borel type ideal I ⊂
S, see [17] for more details. Assume that Ass(I) = {P0, . . . , Pm} with Pi = (x1, . . . , xni),
where n ≥ n0 > n1 > · · · > nm ≥ 1. Also, assume that I = Tm
i=0 Qi is the reduced primary
decomposition of I, with Pi = √Qi, for all 0 ≤ i ≤ m.
We deﬁne Ik := Tm
j=k Qj, for all 0 ≤ k ≤ m. One can easily check that Ii = (Ii−1 :
x∞
ni−1), for all 1 ≤ i ≤ m. The sequence of ideals I = I0 ⊂ I1 ⊂ · · · Im ⊂ Im+1 := S
is called the sequential sequence of I. Let Ji be the monomial ideal generated by G(Ii) is
Si := K[x1, . . . , xni], for all 0 ≤ i ≤ m. Then, the saturation J sat
i = (Ji : (x1, . . . , xn−i)∞) =
Ji+1Si, for all 0 ≤ i ≤ m, where Jm+1 := Sm+1. One has Ii+1/Ii ∼= (J sat
i /Ji)[xni+1, . . . , xn].
If M = Lt≥0 Mt is an Artinian graded S-module, we denote s(M) = max{t : : Mt 6= 0}.
We recall the following result.
Proposition 1.1. ([17, Corollary 2.7]) reg(I) = max{s(J sat
Proposition 1.2. With the above notations, the following assertions hold:

m /Jm)} + 1.

0 /J0), . . . , s(J sat

(1) sdepth(S/Ii) = depth(S/Ii) = n − ni, for all 0 ≤ i ≤ n.
(2) sdepth(I0) ≤ sdepth(I1) ≤ · · · ≤ sdepth(Im).
(3) depth(Ii) = n − ni + 1 ≤ sdepth(Ii) ≤ sdepth(Pi) = n − (cid:4) ni

2 (cid:5) , (∀)0 ≤ i ≤ m.

Proof. (1) Since Ii is an ideal of Borel type for all 0 ≤ i ≤ n, it is enough to consider the case
i = 0. Also, by [18, Lemma 3.6], we can assume n0 = n. Since P0 = (x1, . . . , xn) ∈ Ass(S/I),
it follows that depth(S/I) = 0 and thus, by [8, Theorem 1.4], sdepth(S/I) = 0. See also
[17, Proposition 18].

(2) Since Ii = (Ii−1 : x∞

ni−1), by [19, Proposition 1.3], we get sdepth(Ii−1) ≤ sdepth(Ii),
for all 1 ≤ i ≤ m.
(3) Since Ii = JiS, by [18, Lemma 3.6], it follows that sdepth(Ii) = n−ni+sdepthSi(Ji) ≥
n − ni + 1. Since Pi ∈ Ass(Ii), it follows that there exists a monomial v ∈ S such that

2

Ii = (Pi : v). Therefore, by [19, Proposition 1.3], it follows that sdepth(Pi) ≥ sdepth(Ii).
On the other hand, Pi is generated by variables. Thus, for example by [9, Theorem 1.3], it
follows that sdepth(Pi) = n − j ht(Pi)

2 k = n − (cid:4) ni
2 (cid:5).

The following result is well known, but we present the sketch of the proof.

Lemma 1.3. Let r ≤ n and a1, . . . , ar be some positive integer. If Q = (xa1
then reg(Q) = a1 + · · · + ar − r + 1.
Proof. Let ¯Q = Q ∩ S ′ ⊂ S ′, where S ′ = K[x1, . . . , xr]. As a particular case of Proposition
1.1, we get reg(Q) = reg( ¯Q) = s(S ′/ ¯Q) = a1 + · · · + ar − r + 1.

r ) ⊂ S,

1 , . . . , xar

We recall the following result from [3].

Proposition 1.4. ([3, Corollary 3.17]) If I ⊂ S is an ideal of Borel type with the irredun-
dant irreducible decomposition I = Tr

i=1 Ci, then reg(I) = max{reg(Ci) : 1 ≤ i ≤ r}.

aini

1 , . . . , x

Let n ≥ n0 > n1 > · · · nm ≥ 1 be some integers. Let aij be some positive inte-
gers, where 0 ≤ i ≤ m and 1 ≤ j ≤ ni. We consider the monomial irreducible ideals
Qi = (xai1
j=i Qj and denote I = I0. Since
Pi = (x1, . . . , xni) = √Qi for all 0 ≤ i ≤ m, by [16, Proposition 5.2] or [7, Corollary

ni ), for 0 ≤ i ≤ m. Let Ii

1.2], it follows that I is an ideal of Borel type. As a direct consequence of Lemma 1.3 and
Proposition 1.4, we get the following Corollary.
Corollary 1.5. reg(Ii) = reg(Qi) = ai1 + ai2 + · · · + aini − ni + 1, for all 0 ≤ i ≤ m.

:= Tm

With the above notations, we have the following result.

2 (cid:5) ≥ sdepth(Ii) ≥

Theorem 1.6. If aij ≥ ai+1,j for all j ≤ ni+1 and i < m, then n − (cid:4) ni
n + (cid:6) nm
Proof. The ﬁrst inequality follows from Proposition 1.2(3). In order to prove the second
one, we use induction on i ≤ m. If i = m, then Im = Qm is an irreducible ideal, and
therefore, by [9, Theorem 1.3], sdepth(Im) = n − (cid:4) nm

2 (cid:5) = n + (cid:6) nm
Assume i < m. We can write Qi = Ui + Vi, where Ui = (xai1
ai,ni+1 +1
ni+1+1 , . . . , x

aini+1
ni+1 ) and Vi =
ni ). Since aij ≥ ai+1,j for all j ≤ ni+1, it follows that Ui ⊂ Qi+1. Therefore,
(x
Ii = (Ui + Vi) ∩ Ii+1 = (Ui ∩ Ii+1) + (Vi ∩ Ii+1). Note that J := Ui ∩ Ii+1 = Ui ∩ Ii+2 is a
Borel type ideal with the irreducible irreduntant decomposition J = Ui ∩ Qi+2 ∩ · · · ∩ Qm,
and, therefore, of the same class as Ii+1. Thus, by induction hypothesis, it follows that
sdepth(J) ≥ n + (cid:6) nm
On the other hand, by [6, Remark 1.3] and the induction hypothesis, sdepth(Vi∩Ii+1) ≥
sdepth(Vi) + sdepth(Ii+1) − n = sdepth(Ii+1) − (cid:4) ni−ni+1
Let ¯Vi ⊂ S ′ = K[xni+1+1, . . . , xni] be the monomial ideal generated by G(Vi) and let
¯J ⊂ S ′′ = K[x1, . . . , xni+1, xni+1, . . . , xn] be the monomial ideal generated by G(J). Since
J ⊂ Ii+1, it follows that Ii = ( ¯J ⊗K (S ′′/ ¯Vi)) ⊕ (Vi ∩ Ii). By [5, Proposition 2.10] and [20,
Lemma 2.2], we get: sdepth(Ii) ≥ min{sdepth(J) − ni + ni+1, sdepth(Ii+1) − (cid:4) ni−ni+1
(cid:5)} ≥

Question: What can we say about the case when the condition aij ≥ ai+1,j is removed? Of
course, the method used in the proof of the previous Theorem do not work. However, our
computer experiments in Cocoa [10] suggested that the conclusion of the Theorem 1.6 might
be true. Unfortunately, we are not able to give either a proof, either a counterexample.

The next example shows that the bounds given in Theorem 1.6 are sharp.

Example 1.7. Let I = Q0 ∩ Q1, where Q0 = (x3
are ideals in S = K[x1, . . . , x5]. Then I1 = Q1 and sdepth(I1) = (cid:4) 5
n0 = 5 and n1 = 4. Using CoCoa, we get sdepth(I) = 2 = n − (cid:6) n1
(x2

3, x4, x5) and Q1 = (x1, x2, x3, x4)
2(cid:5) = 3. Also n = 5,
2 (cid:7) − n0. Let Q′

, . . . , xaj +1

Given a sequence A = {a1, . . . , aj} of non-negative integers, where 1 ≤ j ≤ n, we denote by
Q(A), the irreducible monomial ideal (xa1+1
) ⊂ S. Let D = {d1, . . . , dn} := D0
be a graphic sequence. We consider the Havel-Hakimi derivatives D1, . . . , Dm, where m ≤
n − 1 such that Dm contains only zeroes. We denote m(D) := m. We give the following
deﬁnition, which is similar to [2, Deﬁnition 3.2].
Deﬁnition 2.1. The Havel-Hakimi ideal associated to D is I(D) := Tm
Proposition 2.2. I(D) is an ideal of Borel type. Moreover, if I = I0 ⊂ I1 ⊂ · · · Im ⊂
Im+1 := S is the sequential chain of I, then Ii = I(Di), for all 0 ≤ i ≤ m.
Proof. Note that Ass(I(D)) = {P0, . . . , Pm}, where Pi = (x1, . . . , xn−i) = pQ(Dj) for all
0 ≤ i ≤ m. By [16, Proposition 5.2] or [7, Corollary 1.2], it follows that I is of Borel type.
Also, Ij = Tm

j=i Q(Dj) = I(Di).

i=0 Q(Di).

Note that I(D) is an ideal of the same type as the ideals described in the second part of
the ﬁrst section. Using the results from the ﬁrst section, we prove the following Theorem.

Theorem 2.3. For any graphic sequence D, we have:

(1) dim(S/I(D)) = m(D) = n − R(D).
(2) sdepth(S/I(D)) = depth(S/I(D)) = 0.
(3) pd(S/I(D)) = n.
(4) reg(I(D)) = d1 + d2 + · · · + dn + 1.
(5) sdepth(I(D)) ≤ sdepth(I(D1)) ≤ · · · ≤ sdepth(I(Dm(D))) = l n+m(D)

2 (cid:7) ≥ sdepth(I(Di)) ≥ l n−m(D)

m + i, for all 0 ≤ i < m(D).

m.

Proof. (1) Denote m=m(D). Since Min(S/I(D)) = {Pm} and ht(Pm) = n − m, it follows
that dim(S/I(D)) = m. On the other hand, R(D) = n − m(D), and thus we are done.

(2) It follows from Proposition 1.2(1).
(3) Is a direct consequence of (2) and the Auslander-Buchsbaum’s formula.
(4) Is a particular case of Corollary 1.5.

(5) Denote Ii = I(Di), for all 0 ≤ i ≤ m. Note that I(D) = I0 ⊂ II ⊂ · · · Im ⊂
Im+1 := S is the sequential sequence of I(D). Therefore, by Proposition 1.2(2), we get
sdepth(I(D)) ≤ sdepth(I(D1)) ≤ · · · ≤ sdepth(I(Dm)).
2 k = l n+m(D)
m.
it follows that sdepth(I(Dm)) = n − j R(D)

On the other hand, since Im = Q(Dm) is a prime monomial ideal, by [9, Theorem 1.3],

2

(6) Since ni = n − i, for all 0 ≤ i ≤ m, we are done by Theorem 1.6.

Remark 2.4. Note that the results of Theorem 1.6 can be easily applied for ideals of the
form I≤j = Tj
i=0 Q(Di), where 0 ≤ j ≤ m. In this case, we have dim(S/I≤j) = n − j,
reg(I≤j) = reg(Q(D)) and sdepth(I≤j) ≥ (cid:6) n−j
2 (cid:7).
For a non-negative integer a, we denote by ak the sequence a, . . . , a of length k. For
example, {3, 13} = {3, 1, 1, 1}. The bounds given in Theorem 2.3(6) are sharp. Note that
the ideals considered in the Example 1.7 are I = I({2, 12, 02}) and I ′ = I({12, 03}). This
shows that the bounds in Theorem 2.3(3) are the best possible.

We conclude our paper with a list of examples, from graph theory.

2(cid:7), see [4, Theorem 2.2].

Example 2.5. (1) Let G be the discrete graph on the vertex set [n], i.e. G has no edges.
The degree sequence of G is D = D(G) = {0n}. It follows that I(D) = (x1, x2, . . . , xn).
Note that sdepth(I(D)) = (cid:6) n
(2) Let G be the star graph on the vertex set [n], i.e. E(G) = {{1, 2},{1, 3}, . . . ,{1, n}}.
Then D = D(G) = {n, 1n−1}. Note that D1 = {0n−1}. Thus I(D) = (xn+1
n) ∩
(x1, . . . , xn−1) = (xn+1
nxn−1). By Theorem 2.3, dim(R/I(D)) = 1
and reg(I(D)) = 3n. Moreover, if n = 2k, then, sdepth(I(D)) = k and, if n = 2k + 1, then
k ≤ sdepth(I(D)) ≤ k + 1. Using Cocoa, for n = 3 and n = 5, we get sdepth(I(D)) = 2.
We conjecture that sdepth(I(D)) = k, for all n = 2k + 1 with k ≥ 2.
(3) Let Kn be the complete graph on the vertex set [n]. The degree sequence of Kn is
D = D(Kn) = {(n− 1)n}. One can easily check that m(D) = n − 1 and Di = D(Kn−i) for
all 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, where D0 = D. Therefore, I(D) = Tn−1
n−i). By Theorem
2.3, we get dim(R/I(D)) = n− 1 and reg(I(D)) = n2 + 1. Our computer experiments yield
us to conjecture that sdepth(I(D)) = (cid:6) n
(4) Let Pn be the path graph of length n, i.e. E(Pn) = {{1, 2},{2, 3}, . . . ,{n − 1, n}}.
The degree sequence of Pn is D = D(Pn) = {2n−2, 12}. We consider three cases:
(a) If n = 3k, then D0 = D = {23k−2, 12}, D1 = {23k−5, 14}, . . . , Dk−1 = {2, 12k},
Dk = {12k−2, 02}, Dk+1 = {12k−4, 03}, . . . , D2k−1 = {0k+1}.
(b) If n = 3k + 1, then D0 = D = {23k−1, 12}, D1 = {23k−4, 14}, . . . , Dk−1 = {22, 12k},
Dk = {12k, 0}, Dk+1 = {12k−2, 02}, . . . , D2k = {0k+1}.
(c) If n = 3k + 2, then D0 = D = {23k, 12}, D1 = {23(k−1), 14}, . . . , Dk = {12k+2},
Dk+1 = {12k, 0}, . . . , D2k+1 = {0k+1}.
Therefore, by Theorem 2.3, dim(S/I(D)) = n − ⌊n/3⌋ and reg(I(D)) = 2n − 1.
(5) Let Cn be the cycle graph of length n, i.e. E(Cn) = E(Pn) ∪ {n, 1}. The degree
sequence of Cn is D = D(Cn) = {2n}. Note that D1 = {2n−3, 12} = D(Pn−1) therefore, by
(4), dim(S/I(D)) = n−R(D) = n−⌊(n − 1)/3⌋. Also, by Theorem 2.3, reg(I(D)) = 2n+1.
