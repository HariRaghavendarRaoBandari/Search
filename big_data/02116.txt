Abstract

We study complete immersions of ﬁnite topology surfaces Σ in complete Riemannian 3-manifolds
N with sectional curvature KN ≤ −a2 ≤ 0, such that the absolute mean curvature function of Σ is
bounded from above by a and its injectivity radius function is not bounded away from zero on each
of its annular end representatives. We prove that such a surface Σ must be proper in N and its total
curvature must be equal to 2πχ(Σ). If additionally N is a hyperbolic 3-manifold of ﬁnite volume and
Σ is a properly immersed surface of ﬁnite topology with nonnegative constant mean curvature less than
1, then we prove that each end of Σ is asymptotic (with ﬁnite positive multiplicity) to a standard end,
where by standard end we mean an embedded annulus whose lift to hyperbolic 3-space is contained in
an equidistant surface to a totally geodesic plane.

1 Introduction.

In the celebrated paper [4], Colding and Minicozzi proved that complete minimal surfaces of ﬁnite topology
embedded in R3 are proper. Based on the proof of this result, Meeks and Rosenberg [15] showed that
complete, connected minimal surfaces with positive injectivity radius embedded in R3 are proper. Meeks
and Tinaglia [16] then extended both results by proving that complete surfaces with constant mean curvature
embedded in R3 are proper if they have ﬁnite topology or positive injectivity radius. It is natural to ask to
what extent similar properness results hold for complete surfaces of ﬁnite topology in other ambient spaces,
where the surfaces are not necessarily embedded or have constant mean curvature.

In this paper we investigate relationships between properness of a complete immersed surface of ﬁnite
topology in a 3-manifold of nonpositive sectional curvature under certain restrictions on its injectivity radius
function and on its mean curvature function. We ﬁrst derive area estimates for certain compact surfaces
with bounded absolute mean curvature in Hadamard 3-manifolds. We next apply these area estimates to
obtain sufﬁcient conditions for a complete ﬁnite topology surface immersed in a complete 3-manifold with
nonpositive sectional curvature to be proper, as described in Theorem 1.2 below. In order to state this result
we need the following deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 1.1. Let e be an annular end of a complete Riemannian surface Σ whose injectivity radius func-
tion we denote by IΣ : Σ → (0,∞). We say that e has asymptotic injectivity radius I∞
Σ (e) ∈ [0,∞] if for
every one-ended representative E ⊂ Σ of e,

IΣ = I∞

Σ (e).

Lemma 5.1 in the Appendix shows that if Σ has nonpositive Gaussian curvature and an end e has a

representative E which is an annulus, then for every divergent sequence of points pn on E,

n→∞ IΣ(pn) = I∞

lim

Σ (e).

We deﬁne the mean curvature function of an immersed two-sided surface M with a given unit normal
ﬁeld in a Riemannian 3-manifold to be the pointwise average of its principal curvatures; note that if M does
not have a unit normal ﬁeld, then the absolute value |HM| of the mean curvature function of M still makes
sense because a unit normal ﬁeld locally exists on M and under a change of this local choice, the principal
curvatures change sign.
Theorem 1.2. Let N be a complete 3-manifold with sectional curvature KN ≤ −a2 ≤ 0, for some a ≥ 0.
Let ϕ : Σ → N be an isometric immersion of a complete surface Σ with ﬁnite topology, whose mean
curvature function satisﬁes |Hϕ| ≤ a. Then Σ has nonpositive Gaussian curvature and the following hold:
A. If N is simply connected, then I∞
B. If N has positive injectivity radius Inj(N ) = δ > 0, then every end e of Σ satisﬁes I∞

Σ (e) = ∞ for every end e of Σ.

Σ (e) ≥ δ. In

particular, Σ has positive injectivity radius.

C. If IΣ is bounded, then Σ has ﬁnite total curvature

(cid:90)

KΣ = 2πχ(Σ),

Σ

where χ(Σ) is the Euler characteristic of Σ. Furthermore, for each annular end representative E of Σ,
the induced map ϕ∗ : π1(E) → π1(N ) on fundamental groups is injective.

D. If I∞

Σ (e) = 0 for each end e of Σ, then ϕ is proper.

The other main theorems of the paper, Theorems 1.3 and 1.4 below, describe among other things re-
sults on the existence and asymptotic behavior of complete, properly immersed ﬁnite topology surfaces of
constant absolute mean curvature H ∈ [0, 1) in hyperbolic 3-manifolds of ﬁnite volume. Our asymptotic
description of these surfaces was inspired by Theorem 1.1 of Collin, Hauswirth and Rosenberg [6] who
obtained it in the special case that H = 0.

Since every complete hyperbolic 3-manifold N of ﬁnite volume admits a properly immersed annulus E
of constant mean curvature 1 that lifts to an embedded annulus (called a catenoid cousin) in H3 of ﬁnite total
curvature strictly less than 2πχ(E), then the embeddedness hypothesis in the next theorem is a necessary
one. The existence of E also explains why the hypothesis HΣ < 1 in the statement of Theorem 1.4 below
is a necessary one.
Theorem 1.3. Given H ≥ 0, there exists a complete hyperbolic 3-manifold of ﬁnite volume with a properly
embedded, noncompact surface of ﬁnite topology with constant mean curvature H if and only if H ∈ [0, 1).

The standard ends of a surface described in the item 4 of the next theorem are properly embedded annular
ends in N whose lifts to hyperbolic 3-space are contained in equidistant surfaces to totally geodesic planes;
see the discussion just before the statement of Theorem 4.1 in Section 4 for a complete description.
Theorem 1.4. Let N be a complete, noncompact hyperbolic 3-manifold of ﬁnite volume and H ∈ [0, 1).
Let Σ be a complete, properly immersed surface in N of ﬁnite topology with |HΣ| ≤ H. Then:

1. Σ has ﬁnite area.
2. If e is an end of Σ, then I∞

Σ (e) = 0. Moreover, Σ has ﬁnite total curvature

(cid:90)

KΣ = 2πχ(Σ).

(1)

Furthermore, if HΣ = H, then the following additional properties hold:

3. The norm of the second fundamental form of Σ is bounded.

Σ

4. Every annular end representative of an end of Σ is asymptotic (with ﬁnite multiplicity) to a standard

end A0,0(k1, k2) if H = 0, or to A+

H,0(k1, k2) or A−

H,0(k1, k2) if H > 0.

An immediate consequence of item 2 of Theorem 1.4 and of item D of Theorem 1.2 is the following

corollary.
Corollary 1.5. Let N be a hyperbolic manifold of ﬁnite volume and let H ∈ [0, 1). Then a complete
immersed surface Σ in N with ﬁnite topology and mean curvature function |HΣ| ≤ H is proper if and only
I∞
Σ (e) = 0 for each end e of Σ.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we prove isoperimetric inequalities for certain compact
surfaces with boundary in Hadamard 3-manifolds. These isoperimetric inequalities yield area estimates
which are applied in Section 3 to prove Theorem 1.2. In Section 4 we prove Theorems 1.3 and 1.4.

2 An isoperimetric inequality in Hadamard manifolds.

In this section we obtain an isoperimetric inequality for certain hypersurfaces in Hadamard manifolds, see
Theorem 2.1 below. By Hadamard manifold we mean a simply connected manifold with nonpositive sec-
tional curvature.
Theorem 2.1. Let N be a Hadamard manifold of dimension 3 with sectional curvature KN ≤ −a2 ≤ 0
and let Γ be a complete geodesic of N. Given r > 0, there exists a C = C(a, r) > 0 such that every
smooth, immersed, compact orientable surface Σ ⊂ N with mean curvature |HΣ| ≤ a and that stays at a
ﬁnite distance at most r from Γ, satisﬁes

(2)
Proof. Let Γ ⊂ N be a complete geodesic, R = dN (·, Γ) be the ambient distance function to Γ and r > 0
be given. We will prove the theorem using the following claim:

Area(Σ) ≤ C Length(∂Σ).

3

Claim 2.2. There exists a smooth function f : [0, r] → R and constants C1, C2 > 0, whose construction
depends uniquely on the constants r and a, such that for all x ∈ [0, r],

(3)
holds and that, for every smooth compact surface Σ immersed in R−1([0, r)) with mean curvature function
satisfying |HΣ| ≤ a, then

0 ≤ f(cid:48)(x) ≤ C1

∆Σ(f ◦ R) ≥ C2,

in N \ Γ.

(4)

Before we prove the claim, we apply it to obtain the constant C of the theorem. First, note that R is
differentiable in N \ Γ, with (cid:107)grad(R)(cid:107) = 1 in N \ Γ. Let f be the function provided by the claim and let
Σ be a surface satisfying the hypothesis of the theorem. Denoting by ν the conormal vector ﬁeld along ∂Σ,
we can apply the divergence theorem1 to obtain that

∆Σ(f ◦ R) =

(f(cid:48) ◦ R)(cid:104)grad(R), ν(cid:105) ≤ C1 Length(∂Σ),

∂Σ

where last inequality comes from (3). On the other hand, (4) implies

∆Σ(f ◦ R) ≥ C2 Area(Σ).

By deﬁning C = C1/C2, (5) and (6) show that (2) holds for Σ, thereby providing the constant C of
Theorem 2.1. Next, we prove the claim.
Proof of Claim 2.2. Let Σ be as in the claim and let f : [0, r] → R be some smooth function, to be chosen
a posteriori, such that f(cid:48) ≥ 0.
Consider {E1, E2} an orthogonal frame to Σ and let η be a normal unitary vector ﬁeld orienting Σ. A

straightforward calculation shows that

∆Σ(f ◦ R) = (f(cid:48) ◦ R)

where we denote grad = gradN and Hess(R)(X, Y ) = (cid:104)∇Xgrad(R), Y (cid:105), respectively, the gradient and
the Hessian with respect to the ambient space.
As R is the distance function to the geodesic Γ and N has sectional curvature satisfying KN ≤ −a2 ≤ 0,
we have the following Hessian comparison principle, given below in (8), which we now describe. For ρ > 0,
let Cρ = R−1({ρ}) be the geodesic cylinder of radius ρ around Γ and Sρ be a geodesic sphere of radius ρ
centered at a point Γ(s) of Γ. Let ∂θ be a unitary vector ﬁeld tangent to Cρ ∩ Sρ and let ∂s be unitary such
that {grad(R), ∂s, ∂θ} is an orthonormal frame in N, away from Γ; see Figure 1. Then

Hess(R)(∂θ, ∂θ) ≥ µθ(R), Hess(R)(∂s, ∂s) ≥ µs(R),

(8)

1We may assume, without loss of generality, that Σ and Γ are in general position, as we may replace the geodesic Γ by another
ambient geodesic Γ(cid:48) such that Σ will still be at a distance less than r from Γ(cid:48), and the function f and constants C1, C2 given by
Claim 2.2 do not depend on Γ. By general position we mean that they meet transversely at a ﬁnite number of points.

We use (8) to estimate Hess(R)(Ei, Ei). Since

(cid:104)∇∂sgrad(R), ∂θ(cid:105) = 0 = (cid:104)∇∂θgrad(R), ∂s(cid:105)

Ei = (cid:104)Ei, grad(R)(cid:105)grad(R) + (cid:104)Ei, ∂s(cid:105)∂s + (cid:104)Ei, ∂θ(cid:105)∂θ,

and also

then (8) gives

Hess(R)(Ei, Ei) = (cid:104)Ei, ∂s(cid:105)2Hess(R)(∂s, ∂s) + (cid:104)Ei, ∂θ(cid:105)2Hess(R)(∂θ, ∂θ)

≥ (cid:104)Ei, ∂s(cid:105)2µs(R) + (cid:104)Ei, ∂θ(cid:105)2µθ(R).

(10)

We sum (10) for i = 1, 2 and use that µs < µθ to obtain a lower estimate for the ﬁrst term of (7). We
suppress the variable R in the functions µs and µθ to simplify the notation.

Let β be the angle between grad(R) and η. Since f(cid:48) ≥ 0, (11) and (7) imply that

∆Σ(f ◦ R) ≥ f(cid:48)(cid:0)µs + µθ cos2(β)(cid:1) + f(cid:48)(cid:48)(1 − cos2(β)) + 2HΣf(cid:48) cos(β)

At this point, we are able to ﬁnish the proof in the case a = 0, where µs(R) = 0, µθ(R) = 1/R and

HΣ = 0. By choosing f (x) = x2, (12) gives

∆Σ(R2) ≥ 2,

and we can set C1 = f(cid:48)(r) = 2r and C2 = 2, which proves the claim and gives the constant C(0, r) = r in
the theorem.
Next, assume that a > 0. If we suppose that f(cid:48)µθ − f(cid:48)(cid:48) > 0 (this will be shown to hold for our choice

of f), algebraic manipulation in (12) gives

We now make our choice of f. Fix k ∈ N and let fk : R → R be a solution to

To prove the claim it sufﬁces to ﬁnd a lower positive bound for gk, as f(cid:48)
C1 = 1. Note that gk(x) > 0 if and only if

k is nonnegative and bounded by

cosh2(ax) < k + 1.

Choose n ∈ N such that cosh2(ar) < n + 1. Then fn is a function that satisﬁes (3) in [0, r], for C1 = 1.
A direct calculation of the derivative of gn shows that it is a decreasing function in [0, r]; thus, if we set
C2 = gn(r) > 0, it follows that gn(x) ≥ C2 > 0 for x ∈ [0, r]. Since n was chosen independently of Σ and
C1, C2 depend uniquely on fn, this completes the proof of the claim in the case when a > 0.

As explained immediately after the statement of Claim 2.2, the theorem is now proved.

Remark 2.3. The hypothesis |HΣ| ≤ a in Theorem 2.1 cannot be improved.
Indeed, if N is simply
connected, of constant sectional curvature KN = −a2 ≤ 0, then, for each H > a, there exists a geodesic
cylinder of constant mean curvature H, containing compact subdomains with constant boundary length and
with arbitrarily large area.

The next corollary is an immediate consequence of Theorem 2.1. One only needs to check that if the
boundary of the surface Σ given below has length L, then Σ is contained in a solid geodesic cylinder of
radius L/2, which follows from the mean curvature comparison principle.

Corollary 2.4 (Area estimate for surfaces with two boundary components). Let N be a Hadamard 3-
manifold with sectional curvature KN ≤ −a2 ≤ 0. Then, for each L > 0, there is a constant C = C(a, L)
such that the following holds.
Let Σ ⊂ N be a compact surface immersed in N with |HΣ| ≤ a. If the boundary of Σ consists on one

or two components and has total length at most L, then

Area(Σ) ≤ C L.

(20)

3 The proof of Theorem 1.2.
Throughout this section N will be a complete Riemannian 3-manifold with sectional curvature KN ≤
−a2 ≤ 0, and ϕ : Σ → N will be an isometric immersion of a ﬁnite topology surface Σ such that the mean
curvature function Hϕ of the immersion satisﬁes |Hϕ| ≤ a. A simple consequence of the Gauss equation is
that the Gaussian curvature function KΣ of Σ is nonpositive; hence, if p ∈ Σ and IΣ(p) is ﬁnite, then there
is a closed geodesic loop based at p in Σ of length 2IΣ(p) (see, for instance, Proposition 2.12, Chapter 13
of [8]). Moreover, it follows from the Gauss-Bonnet formula that such loop is homotopically nontrivial in
Σ. The existence of such loops will be used in the proofs of the next two propositions.
Proposition 3.1. Suppose N is simply connected and E ≡ S1 × [0, +∞) is a complete, noncompact
Riemannian annulus with compact boundary. If ϕ : E → N is an isometric immersion with |Hϕ| ≤ a, then
E = ∞. In particular, item A of Theorem 1.2 holds.
I∞
Proof. An elementary calculation shows that there is an ε > 0 independent of E such that intrinsic balls
BE(p, ε) ⊂ E − ∂E have area greater than some ﬁxed positive constant; see Theorem 3 and Remark 4 in
the appendix of [9]. In particular, since E is noncompact, complete and has compact boundary, then E has
inﬁnite area.

7

Arguing by contradiction, suppose that the asymptotic injectivity radius of E is I∞

E , there is an intrinsically divergent sequence of points {qn}n in E such that

the deﬁnition of I∞

E = L ∈ [0, ∞). By

lim
n→∞ IE(qn) = L.

After replacing by a subsequence, IE(qn) < L + 1, {dE(qn, ∂E)}n is increasing, dE(q1, ∂E) ≥ L + 1 and
dE(qn, qn+1) ≥ 2L + 2. Hence, there exist homotopically nontrivial geodesic loops γn with base points qn
and lengths equal to 2IE(qn) < 2L + 2, which are pairwise disjoint by the triangle inequality.

For n > 1, let En be the compact annular region of E bounded by γ1 and γn. Since the total length of
∂En is less than 4L + 4, it follows from Corollary 2.4 that there is a constant C such that En satisﬁes the
uniform area estimate (20):

Area(En) ≤ C(4L + 4).

In particular, E has ﬁnite area, which contradicts our previous observation that the area of E was inﬁnite,
and completes the proof that I∞
Proposition 3.2. Suppose ϕ : E → N is an isometric immersion of a complete annulus E ≡ S1 × [0, +∞)
in N satisfying |Hϕ| ≤ a. Then:

E = ∞.

E ∈ [0,∞), then the induced homomorphism ϕ∗ : π1(E) → π1(N ) is injective.
E ≥ Inj(N ), where Inj(N ) denotes the injectivity radius of N.
E = 0, then ϕ is proper.

I. If I∞
II. I∞
III. If I∞
Proof. We ﬁrst prove item I of the proposition. Arguing by contradiction, suppose I∞

E is ﬁnite and

ϕ∗ : π1(E) → π1(N )

is not injective. Since π1(E) is isomorphic to Z, the kernel K of ϕ∗ is a cyclic subgroup of index n,

for some n ∈ N. Let Π : (cid:101)E → E be the n-sheeted covering space of E corresponding to the subgroup
K. Note that (cid:101)E is an annulus of nonpositive Gaussian curvature, I∞(cid:101)E
y ∈ Π−1(x) ⇒ I(cid:101)E(y) ≤ nIE(x)) and the induced map from the fundamental group of (cid:101)E to N is trivial.
By covering space theory, (ϕ ◦ Π) : (cid:101)E → N lifts isometrically to the universal cover (cid:101)N of N, which is
a Hadamard manifold with respect to the pulled-back metric. Since I∞(cid:101)E

is less than or equal to nI∞

is ﬁnite, Proposition 3.1 gives a

E (since

contradiction, thereby completing the proof of item I.

We next prove statement II. Suppose that I∞

E < Inj(N ). Then there exists a geodesic loop γ in E with
length less than 2Inj(N ). As γ is homotopically nontrivial in E and lies in a simply connected ball in N,
then for any p ∈ γ, the induced map ϕ∗ : π1(E, p) → π1(N, p) is trivial, contradicting item I.
Finally, we prove III. If ϕ were not proper, there would exist an intrinsically divergent sequence of points
qn ∈ E, such that ϕ(qn) converges to a point q ∈ N. Lemma 5.1 in the Appendix implies limn→∞ IE(qn) =
0; hence, after replacing by a subsequence, qn ∈ BN (q, IN (q)/2) and there exist homotopically nontrivial
geodesic loops γn based at qn with lengths 2IE(qn) < IN (q). By the triangle inequality, the loops ϕ(γn) are
contained in the simply connected geodesic ball BN (q, IN (q)), contradicting item I. Thus, ϕ is proper.

All of the assertions in Theorem 1.2, except for the ﬁrst statement of item C of Theorem 1.2, follow
immediately from Propositions 3.1 and 3.2. The Cohn-Vossen [3] inequality implies that for any complete
surface M of nonpositive curvature,

KM ≤ 2πχ(M ).

4 Asymptotics of H-surfaces in hyperbolic 3-manifolds of ﬁnite volume.

In this section, we prove Theorem 1.4, which describes the asymptotic behavior of certain immersed surfaces
in hyperbolic manifolds of ﬁnite volume. Before we state and prove this result, we will set up the notation
that we will use, give a brief review of the structure of the ends of hyperbolic manifolds of ﬁnite volume,
called cusp ends, and describe the standard examples of annular ends with constant mean curvature in the
cusp ends.

We will use the half-space model for the hyperbolic space:

H3 = {(x, y, z) ∈ R3 | z > 0},

endowed with the metric ds2 =

dx2 + dy2 + dz2

z2

. In this model, the horizontal planes

H(t) = {(x, y, z) ∈ H3 | z = t}

are horospheres, with constant mean curvature 1 with respect to its upward pointing unit normal ﬁeld.
Vertical planes are totally geodesic and isometric to the hyperbolic plane H2. Moreover, tilted planes are
hyperspheres, that is to say, they are equidistant surfaces to the totally geodesic vertical plane which inter-
sects {z = 0} along the same line; if a hypersphere P in H3 meets {z = 0} in an angle α ∈ (0, π/2), then
P has constant mean curvature HP = cos(α) ∈ (0, 1) (see Figure 2).
Fix two linearly independent horizontal vectors u = (ux, uy, 0), v = (vx, vy, 0) ∈ R3 and let G(u, v)
be the group of parabolic translations of H3 generated by u, v, i.e., G(u, v) = {τ (m, n) | (m, n) ∈ Z×Z},
where each τ (m, n) is the parabolic isometry of H3 deﬁned by τ (m, n)(p) = p + mu + nv. In coordinates,

τ (m, n) :

H3 → H3

(x, y, z)

vertical plane P0,c(k1, k2).

H,c(k1, k2) has constant mean curvature H ∈ (0, 1) and is equidistant to the totally geodesic

by the action of the group G(ui, vi). Since G(ui, vi) leaves every horosphere H(t) invariant and M(ti) is
foliated by {H(t)}t≥ti, each Ci admits a product foliation by the family of constant mean curvature 1 tori
{T (t) = H(t)/G(ui, vi)}t≥ti. Also, the fundamental group of each Ci is naturally isomorphic to G(ui, vi),
viewed as the subgroup of isometries of M(ti) that commute with the covering map ψi : M(ti) → Ci.
Fix a cusp end C = M(t0)/G(u, v) of a hyperbolic manifold N of ﬁnite volume. We now describe the
standard constant mean curvature annular ends in C. Consider a pair of integers (k1, k2) ∈ Z × Z \ {(0, 0)}
such that the greatest common divisor of k1 and k2 equals 1. For each c ∈ R, let P0,c(k1, k2) be the vertical
plane deﬁned by

P0,c(k1, k2) = {(x, y, z) ∈ H3 | (k1uy + k2vy)x − (k1ux + k2vx)y + c = 0, z > 0}.

For each c ∈ R, τ (k1, k2) leaves invariant P0,c(k1, k2); hence,

A0,c(k1, k2) = (P0,c(k1, k2) ∩ M(t0))/τ (k1, k2)

is a properly embedded totally geodesic annulus in C. Note that the family of constant mean curvature
annuli {A0,c(k1, k2)}c∈R in C is periodic in the sense that there exists an l ∈ R such that for any c ∈ R,
A0,c(k1, k2) = A0,l+c(k1, k2), since for each (m, n) ∈ Z × Z,

τ (m, n)(P0,c(k1, k2)) = P0,c+(k1n−k2m)(uxvy−uyvx)(k1, k2).

Finally, we consider the two families {P +

H,c(k1, k2)}H∈(0,1) and {P−
H,c(k1, k2)}H∈(0,1) of equidistant
surfaces to P0,c(k1, k2), formed by tilted planes of constant mean curvature H ∈ (0, 1) that meet {z = 0}
along the line {(k1uy + k2vy)x − (k1ux + k2vx)y + c = 0}. Each P±
H,c(k1, k2) is also invariant by
τ (k1, k2), and so each of the surfaces P±
H,c(k1, k2)∩M(t0)) descends to C as a properly embedded annulus
A±
H,c(k1, k2) of constant mean curvature H, and the family {A±
H,c(k1, k2)}c∈R is also periodic with c. With
this notation and for the reader’s convenience, we next restate Theorem 1.4.

Theorem 4.1. Let N be a complete, noncompact hyperbolic 3-manifold of ﬁnite volume and H ∈ [0, 1).
Let Σ be a complete, properly immersed surface in N of ﬁnite topology with |HΣ| ≤ H. Then:

1. Σ has ﬁnite area.
2. If e is an end of Σ, then I∞

Σ (e) = 0. Moreover, Σ has ﬁnite total curvature

(cid:90)

KΣ = 2πχ(Σ).

(22)

Furthermore, if HΣ = H, then the following additional properties hold:

3. The norm of the second fundamental form of Σ is bounded.

Σ

4. Every annular end representative of an end of Σ is asymptotic (with ﬁnite multiplicity) to a standard

end A0,0(k1, k2) if H = 0, or to A+

H,0(k1, k2) or A−

H,0(k1, k2) if H > 0.

Proof. Let ϕ : Σ → N be the immersed surface given in the statement of the theorem and let e be an annular
end of Σ. Since ϕ is a proper map, then e has an annular end representative E such that ϕ(E) is contained
in C, which is a cusp end of N. Up to a reparametrization, we may assume that C = ∪t≥1T (t) and that
ϕ(∂E) ⊂ ∪t∈[1, t0]T (t), for some t0 ≥ 1. We also use the notation ϕ = ϕ|E.
Claim 4.2. For almost every t ≥ t0, ϕ(E) meets the torus T (t) transversely and for each such t there is a
unique homotopically nontrivial closed curve αt ⊂ E such that ϕ(αt) is contained in T (t). Moreover, the
annular subend E(cid:48) of E determined by αt is immersed in ∪s≥tT (s) by ϕ.
Proof of Claim 4.2. Sard’s Theorem implies that for almost all t ≥ t0, ϕ is transverse to T (t) and for such
t, Γt = ϕ−1(T (t)) is a ﬁnite collection of pairwise disjoint simple closed curves in E. Fix a regular value
t1 > t0. We next prove that exactly one of the curves in Γt1 is homotopically nontrivial in E. Since
ϕ−1(∪t∈[1,t1]T (t)) is a compact surface (possibly disconnected) containing ∂E, then the 1-cycle ∂E is Z2-
homologous to the collection of unoriented curves in Γt1. Since ∂E represents the nontrivial element in
H1(E, Z2), then at least one of the curves in Γt1 is homotopically nontrivial.
Concerning the uniqueness part of the claim, assume that there are two homotopically nontrivial curves,
α1, α2, in E such that ϕ(α1) and ϕ(α2) are both contained in T (t1). Consider the subends E1, E2 ⊂ E

determined respectively by α1, α2 and assume that E2 ⊂ E1. Let (cid:98)E ⊂ E be the compact annulus bounded
by α1 and α2. Then, either ϕ((cid:98)E) intersects ∪t<t1T (t) or it is contained in ∪t≥t1T (t). If the ﬁrst case
occurs, there is a t∗ < t1 such that ϕ((cid:98)E) intersects T (t∗) but does not intersect T (t) for any t < t∗.
determined by T (t), the mean curvature comparison principle for the surfaces ϕ((cid:98)E) and T (t∗) at a point
in ϕ((cid:98)E) ∩ T (t∗) gives a contradiction. Therefore, ϕ((cid:98)E) ⊂ ∪t≥t1T (t), which implies that ϕ(E2) contains
points in ∪t<t1T (t) near ϕ(α2) since ϕ(E) meets T (t1) transversely. Since ϕ is proper, we may ﬁnd
t(cid:48)∗ < t1, where t(cid:48)∗ is the smallest t such that ϕ(E2) intersects T (t), which by the previous argument gives a
contradiction that proves the claim.

Because the mean curvature vector of every torus T (t) has length 1 and points into the cusp subend of C

Because of Claim 4.2 we henceforth assume, without loss of generality, that t0 = 1 and that ϕ(E)

intersects ∂C = T (1) transversely in the set ∂E = α1.

Let R : C → [0, ∞) be the distance function to T (1). By following the arguments in the proof of
Theorem 2.1, one can obtain under the assumptions of the theorem that the intrinsic Laplacian of R ◦ ϕ,
satisﬁes

For almost every t > 1, consider the homotopically nontrivial curve αt ⊂ E given in Claim 4.2 and we

∆E(R ◦ ϕ) ≤ H 2 − 1 < 0.

Applying the divergence theorem to the left hand side of (24), gives

∆E(R ◦ ϕ) ≤ (H 2 − 1)Area(Et).

The second item of the theorem follows from item 1, as we next explain. If I∞

(27)
Letting t → ∞ in (27) and noticing that ∪t≥1Et = E, it follows that the end representative E has ﬁnite
area, which proves item 1.
Σ (e) > 0, then there is
an ε > 0 and a divergent sequence of points {pn}n∈N in E such that {BE(pn, ε)}n∈N is a pairwise disjoint
collection of disks of nonpositive curvature and so, by comparison theorems, satisfy Area(BE(pn, ε)) ≥
πε2. Hence E has inﬁnite area, contradicting the ﬁnite area property of Σ, which proves that I∞
Σ (e) = 0.
To ﬁnish the proof of this item, note I∞
Σ (e) = 0 implies that IΣ is bounded. Then (22) holds by item C of
Theorem 1.2, which completes the proof of item 2.

We next prove item 3. Assume HΣ = H. Since IΣ is bounded, then item C of Theorem 1.2 implies
that the induced map from the fundamental group of E to the fundamental group of N is injective. We
next ﬁx some notation. Assume that C is isometric to the quotient space M(1)/G(u, v), for two linearly
independent horizontal vectors u and v. Let ψ : M(1) → C be the covering of C associated to G(u, v) and

let Π : (cid:101)E → E be the universal cover of E. Choose a base point p ∈ E and consider ϕ(p) ∈ C. By choosing
(cid:101)p ∈ Π−1({p}) and (cid:98)p ∈ ψ−1(ϕ(p)), covering space theory implies that there exists a unique immersion
φ : (cid:101)E → M(1) such that φ((cid:101)p) =(cid:98)p and ψ ◦ φ = ϕ ◦ Π; in particular, it follows that φ is proper. Moreover,
φ((cid:101)E) is an immersed half-plane in H3. See Figure 3.

12

Figure 3: The immersions φ and ϕ and the covering maps Π : (cid:101)E → E and ψ : M(1) → C.
To prove item 3, it sufﬁces to prove that φ((cid:101)E) has bounded norm of the second fundamental form (cid:107)Aφ(cid:107).
Arguing by contradiction, assume there exists a sequence of points {pn}n∈N in (cid:101)E such that (cid:107)Aφ(cid:107)((cid:98)pn) ≥ n,
where we denote(cid:98)pn = φ(pn). Since (cid:107)Aϕ(cid:107) is bounded on compact sets, the sequence of the image points
{ψ((cid:98)pn)}n∈N ⊂ ϕ(E) is intrinsically (thus extrinsically, since ϕ is proper) divergent. After choosing a
subsequence, dC(ψ((cid:98)pn)), ψ((cid:98)pm)) > 2, for n (cid:54)= m; hence the sequence {(cid:98)pn}n∈N in H3 is extrinsically
divergent and dH3((cid:98)pn, (cid:98)pm) > 2 for n (cid:54)= m.
Without loss of generality, we may assume that the spheres {∂BH3((cid:98)pn, 1)}n are transverse to φ. For
n ∈ N, let Cn ⊂ (cid:101)E be a maximal connected domain of φ−1(BH3((cid:98)pn, 1)) containing pn. Consider the

function

fn : Cn → R

x

(28)

(cid:107)Aφ(cid:107)((cid:98)qn)d((cid:98)qn, ∂BH3((cid:98)pn, 1)) = fn(qn) ≥ fn(pn) = (cid:107)Aφ(cid:107)((cid:98)pn) ≥ n.

(cid:55)→ (cid:107)Aφ(cid:107)(φ(x))dH3(φ(x), ∂BH3((cid:98)pn, 1)).
Let qn ∈ Cn be a point where fn attains its maximum value. Let(cid:98)qn = φ(qn). Then,
Let λn = (cid:107)Aφ(cid:107)((cid:98)qn) and δn = dH3((cid:98)qn, ∂BH3((cid:98)pn, 1)). Note that, if x ∈ Cn and φ(x) ∈ (BH3((cid:98)qn, δn/2)),
then (cid:107)Aφ(cid:107)(φ(x)) ≤ 2λn, since dH3(φ(x),(cid:98)qn) < δn/2.
Using exponential coordinates in H3 centered at the point(cid:98)qn, consider λnBH3((cid:98)qn, δn/2) to be a ball
of radius λnδn/2 in R3 with (cid:98)qn at the origin. Equation (28) implies λnδn → ∞, and so the sequence
{λnBH3((cid:98)qn, δn/2)}n∈N of Riemannian balls converges to the Euclidean space R3 with its ﬂat metric. Let
(cid:98)Cn = φ(Cn) ∩ BH3((cid:98)qn, δn/2) and, for r > 0, let Bn(r) = BλnH3((cid:98)qn, r) = λnBH3((cid:98)qn, r/λn). The scaled

In this proof we use the following notation: for λ > 0 and a Riemannian manifold M = (M, g), we

denote λM = (M, λ2g) the Riemannian manifold given by a scaling of the metric of M by λ.

surfaces λn(cid:98)Cn are immersed in Bn(λnδn/2), with constant mean curvature Hn = H/λn and satisfy
The bound on the second fundamental form of λn(cid:98)Cn implies that there is a δ > 0 such that for every

(cid:107)Aλn(cid:98)Cn
n ∈ N, there exists a connected domain Gn of Cn such that:

(cid:107)((cid:98)qn) = 1.

(cid:107)Aλn(cid:98)Cn

(cid:107) ≤ 2,

(29)

1. λnφ(Gn) ⊂ Bn(δ);
2. ∂[λnφ(Gn)] = λnφ(∂Gn) ⊂ ∂Bn(δ);
3. φ(Gn) is embedded and it is a graph over its projection to T(cid:98)qnφ(Gn), with graphing function having
uniformly bounded gradient, for all n ∈ N.

A subsequence of the graphs {λnφ(Gn)}n∈N (which we still denote by {λnφ(Gn)}n∈N) converges, as
n → ∞, to a minimal graph G∞ ⊂ R3, embedded in BR3((cid:126)0, δ) and with ∂G∞ ⊂ ∂BR3((cid:126)0, δ). We next use
the Gauss map g : G∞ → S2 of G∞ to produce a contradiction to the already proved property that E has
ﬁnite total curvature.
λH3 is well-known to be isometric to a Lie group together with a left invariant metric. This Lie group is
the semidirect product of R2 with R having associated homomorphism τ : R → Gl(2, R) given by τ (t) =
exp(tIλ) ∈ Gl(2, R), where Iλ is the 2×2 diagonal matrix with λ as diagonal entries; see, for instance, [14].
In this R3 coordinate model for λH3 the horizontal planes are left and right cosets of the normal subgroup R2
of the Lie group, which we view as being the (x, y)-plane with the metric at the origin (0, 0, 0) corresponding
to the usual metric on R3; also left translations by elements in R2 correspond to parabolic isometries in the
previous upper halfspace model for λH3 given by translations by horizontal vectors.
From this point of view, for each n ∈ N, the metric of λnH3 is left invariant and there is a left invariant
Gauss map, deﬁned for any orientable surface immersed in λnH3. Denote by gn : λnφ(Gn) → S2 the left
invariant Gauss map of the oriented embedded surface λnφ(Gn) ⊂ λnH3. Since the group structures of
λnH3 converges to the abelian group structure of R3, then gn converges to g : G∞ → S2, the Gauss map of
G∞. This convergence is explained in [13], in the last paragraph of Step 4 of the proof of Theorem 4.1.

Note that (29) implies that

Hence g is locally injective, since G∞ is a nonﬂat minimal surface of R3; thus there exists(cid:101)δ ∈ (0, δ) such
that the graph G∞∩BR3((cid:126)0,(cid:101)δ) is a disk and g : G∞∩BR3((cid:126)0,(cid:101)δ) → S2 is injective. Moreover, the convergence
gn → g implies that there is δ(cid:48) ∈ (0,(cid:101)δ) such that, for n sufﬁciently large, gn : λnφ(Gn) ∩ Bn(δ(cid:48)) → S2 is

(cid:107)AG∞(cid:107)((cid:126)0) = 1.

(cid:107)AG∞(cid:107) ≤ 2,

also injective.
The fact that G∞ is not ﬂat also implies that G∞ ∩ BR3((cid:126)0, δ(cid:48)) has strictly negative total curvature, hence
there is K0 > 0 such that, for n sufﬁciently large, λnφ(Gn) ∩ Bn(δ(cid:48)) has total curvature less than −K2
0.
Since total curvature is invariant under scalings, it follows that

(cid:90)

The assumption dC(ψ((cid:98)pn), ψ((cid:98)pm)) > 2 if n (cid:54)= m implies that, for n (cid:54)= m, Π(Gn) ∩ Π(Gm) = ∅,
therefore {Π(Gn ∩ φ−1(Bn(δ(cid:48))))}n∈N is a collection of pairwise disjoint domains of E. Furthermore, the
assumption that gn is injective in Bn(δ(cid:48)) implies that Π|φ−1(Bn(δ(cid:48))) is injective, then each domain Π(Gn ∩

Gn∩φ−1(Bn(δ(cid:48)))

K(cid:101)E < −K2

0 < 0.

14

φ−1(Bn(δ(cid:48)))) has negative total curvature, uniformly bounded away from zero by (30). Hence, we conclude
that the total curvature of E is inﬁnite, which contradicts item C of Theorem 1.2 and proves that (cid:107)Aφ(cid:107) is
bounded, ﬁnishing the proof of item 3.
Next, we proceed with the proof of the theorem by proving item 4, where we analyze the asymptotic
behavior of E. For some ﬁxed (k1, k2) ∈ Z × Z, every two P +
H,c(k1, k2) are
isometric and asymptotic to each other; thus, we ﬁx c = 0 and prove that there is a pair of integers (k1, k2)
H,0(k1, k2), with multiplicity 1. Furthermore, we
H,0(k1, k2) =
ψ(P−
H,0(k1, k2)), with ﬁnite multiplicity k.
Let [α1] be the generator of π1(E). Since π1(C) ≡ Z × Z, we can consider ϕ∗([α1]) to be an element
of the form k(k1, k2) ∈ Z × Z, for some relatively prime integers k1, k2 ∈ Z and some k ∈ N. Hence, the
map τ = τ (kk1, kk2)

such that (cid:101)E is asymptotic either to P +
will show that ϕ(E) = ψ((cid:101)E) is asymptotic to A+

Proof of Claim 4.3. First, note that ϕ(E) ⊂ ∪t≥1T (t), hence φ((cid:101)E) is contained in M(1), thus it is never
below H(1). Next, we show that φ((cid:101)E) is also never below P−

a continuous family of circles of radius r, contained in the half plane {bx − ay + c < 0} ∩ {z = 0} and
converging, when r → ∞, to the line {bx − ay + c = 0} ∩ {z = 0}. Let Sr be the upper half sphere of
radius r, centered in the center of the circle Cr. Then, Sr is a totally geodesic surface of H3 and the family
{Sr}r>0 converges, when r → ∞, to the vertical half-plane P0,c.

H ∪ P−

Any surface invariant under a 1-parameter group of parabolic isometries is called a parabolic-invariant
surface. The intersection of any parabolic-invariant surface S with the totally geodesic plane perpendicular
to the Killing ﬁeld generating these isometries is then a smooth curve, called the generating curve of S. In
our case, let α be the generating curve of L; we next prove that α is a straight line, hence L is either P +
or P−
H, which are the unique complete, constant mean curvature H planes contained in R. We do so by
contradiction, so we assume α is not a straight line.
After a rotation of H3, assume that α is contained in the plane {y = 0}. Let a parametrization of α be

H

given by

α(s) = (x(s), 0, z(s)),

where we consider s the Euclidean arc length of α, deﬁned on its maximal (possibly unbounded) interval
(a, b). Hence, there exists a function θ : (a, b) → R satisfying

(cid:26) x(cid:48)(s) = cos(θ(s))

z(cid:48)(s) = sin(θ(s)).

(34)
We claim that θ(cid:48) never vanishes. Arguing by contradiction, assume there is s0 ∈ (a, b) such that θ(cid:48)(s0) =
0 and let p = (x(s0), 0, z(s0)) ∈ L. Let z ∈ C be a conformal coordinate system for L in a neighborhood
of p; the left invariant Gauss map g of L satisﬁes gz(p) = 0. On the other hand, the H-potential R of L
(see [13], Deﬁnition 3.2) could vanish only at a point q ∈ L such that TqL is parallel either to P +
H or to
P−
H. The boundary maximum principle implies that this cannot happen; hence R never vanishes and we
can apply Theorem 3.7 of [13] (see also item (2) of Theorem 3.15 of [14]) to obtain that the metric in L is
degenerate, a contradiction that proves that θ(cid:48)(s) (cid:54)= 0, ∀s ∈ (a, b).

It follows from the fact that L has constant mean curvature H that

(35)
Let θH ∈ (0, π/2) be such that cos(θH ) = H. Since θ(cid:48) never vanishes, we obtain that |θ(s)| (cid:54)= θH, for
s ∈ (a, b). This has the geometric meaning that the tangent plane of L is never parallel to the tangent plane
H or P−
of P +
We claim that sin(θ(s)) never vanishes. Let us assume that, for some s0 ∈ (a, b), sin(θ(s0)) = 0.
Hence, either θ(s0) = 2kπ or θ(s0) = (2k + 1)π, for some k ∈ Z. Let us consider the point p =
(x(s0), 0, z(s0)) ∈ L. If θ(s0) = 2kπ, it follows from (35) that θ(cid:48)(s) < 0 for all s ∈ (a, b), then p is a
maximal point of index 1 to the height function; since there is no such type of critical point in ϕ(E), this is
a contradiction, hence θ(s0) = (2k + 1)π. However, this implies that p is a point where the height function
attains a local minimal value, which cannot happen by the mean curvature comparison principle applied to
the horizontal plane through p, with mean curvature 1 pointing upwards, and L.
This argument allows us to assume that the function θ either takes values in (0, π) or in (−π, 0). We shall
treat uniquely the ﬁrst case, since the second is analogous; hence we assume that θ(s) > 0 for s ∈ (a, b),
and (34) implies that s (cid:55)→ z(s) is an increasing function.
Since (a, b) is the maximal interval of deﬁnition of α(s) and L lies in R, it follows that a (cid:54)= −∞ and
b = ∞. Moreover, it holds

z(s) = 0,

From (35), we obtain that θ(cid:48)(s) → 0 when s → ∞, thus there exists some θ∞ ∈ [0, π/2] such that
lims→∞ θ(s) = θ∞. We claim that θ∞ = θH.
Take a divergent sequence {sn}n∈N of positive real numbers. Let pn = (x(sn), 0, z(sn)) ∈ L and let
Ln = σz(sn)(L) be the homothety of L, where σt is given by (33). Then, up to a subsequence, Ln will
converge to a plane in R, meeting {z = 0} in an angle of θ∞. Since the mean curvature of this plane is
cos(θ∞), it follows that θ∞ = θH.
Next, we obtain the contradiction that proves Claim 4.4. Since θ(s) (cid:54)= θH for all s ∈ (a,∞), either
If the ﬁrst happens, then cos(θ(s)) > H for all
the function θ takes values in (0, θH ) or in (θH , π).
s ∈ (a, ∞), hence (35) gives that s (cid:55)→ θ(s) is a decreasing function. Since lims→∞ θ(s) = θH, this
contradicts the assumption that θ takes values in (0, θ). The other case is analogous.

A simple and interesting consequence of Theorem 1.4 is the following corollary, which generalizes to

the nonzero constant mean curvature case some of the corollaries of Theorem 1.1 of [6].

Corollary 4.6. Let N be a complete, noncompact, hyperbolic 3-manifold of ﬁnite volume. Let Σ a complete,
properly immersed surface in N of ﬁnite topology with constant mean curvature HΣ = H ∈ [0, 1). Then,
if Σ has genus g and n ends, we have that

2g + n ≥ 3.

Moreover, the area of Σ satisﬁes

with equality in (37) if and only if Σ is totally umbilic.

Proof. The proof is straightforward and relies only on item 2 of Theorem 1.4 and on the Gauss equation,
after observing that χ(Σ) = 2 − 2g − n. The details are left to the reader.
The next theorem is a restatement of Theorem 1.3 in the Introduction.

Theorem 4.7. Given H ≥ 0, there exists a complete hyperbolic 3-manifold of ﬁnite volume with a properly
embedded, noncompact surface of ﬁnite topology with constant mean curvature H if and only if H ∈ [0, 1).
Proof. Let H ∈ [0, 1) and we shall prove there exists a complete hyperbolic 3-manifold NH of ﬁnite vol-
ume that admits a connected, properly embedded, noncompact surface ΣH of ﬁnite topology with constant
mean curvature H. In [1], Adams proved that many complete hyperbolic 3-manifolds of ﬁnite volume ad-
mit properly embedded totally geodesic three-punctured two-spheres (in [5] it is proved that any minimally
immersed three-punctured two-sphere in a hyperbolic 3-manifold of ﬁnite volume is totally geodesic). Sup-
pose that Σ is a properly embedded, totally geodesic surface of ﬁnite topology with a unitary normal ﬁeld
η in a complete hyperbolic 3-manifold N of ﬁnite volume. Then, for any t > 0, the “t-parallel” surface
Σ(t) = {expN (tη(p)) | p ∈ Σ} is the image of a complete, proper immersion of Σ into N of constant mean
curvature H(t) = cos(arctan(1/t)), which is always injectively immersed in some collection of cusp end
representatives of N; further, there is some tN > 0 such that, for t < tN , the properly immersed surface
Σ(t) is also embedded, and such tN depends only on the injectivity radius function on the thick part3 of N.
Thus, Adams’ examples yield properly embedded three-punctured two-spheres of small positive constant
mean curvature in many complete hyperbolic 3-manifolds of ﬁnite volume.
Let Σ ⊂ N be one of the examples of Adams with respective tN > 0 and let H ∈ [0, 1). Since H(0) = 0
and limt→∞ H(t) = 1, we can choose a t0 with H(t0) = H. Let m ∈ N be such that mtN > t0. Next, we

that IN|Ω ≥ ε and N \ Ω is a ﬁnite, disjoint union of cusp ends Ci, i = 1, . . . , n, with IN|Ci < ε, for every i.

Fix H ≥ 1 and we next prove that a complete hyperbolic 3-manifold N of ﬁnite volume does not
admit any connected, properly embedded, noncompact surfaces of constant mean curvature H. Arguing by
contradiction suppose that Σ ⊂ N is such a surface and let Π : H3 → N be the universal cover of N with

In this case consider a lift (cid:101)E of E to H3 that is properly embedded in a closed horoball B ⊂ H3 that

that ∂(cid:101)E ⊂ ∂B. Next, we will prove that if this is the case, then Π|(cid:101)E is not injective, a contradiction since E

Since S is an embedded noncompact annulus with ∂S ⊂ ∂B, B − S has two connected components

θ : B → B be any nontrivial covering transformation of the covering space Π|B : B → C. Note that θ(M )∩
M (cid:54)= ∅, otherwise M (which has inﬁnite volume) would be isometrically mapped into N, a contradiction

since N has ﬁnite volume by assumption. Since (cid:101)E is embedded and also has the topology of a noncompact
annulus, again it divides B into two connected components, which we denote (cid:102)M and(cid:102)W , with (cid:102)M simply

By the main result in [12], the annulus (cid:101)E is asymptotic to the end of a surface T ⊂ H3 of revolution with
axis a geodesic Γ ⊂ H3 and T is invariant under a translation along Γ. Since (cid:101)E is asymptotic to an end of
T , then there is a closed subhoroball B1 ⊂ B such that (cid:101)E ∩ B1 is a smooth surface with boundary contained
in the horosphere ∂B1. Note that the geodesic arc Γ ∩ B1 is contained in a component ∆ of B1 − (cid:101)E that is
mean convex and ∆∩ ∂B1 is a compact subdomain of ∂B1. Let θ ∈ Z× Z be any of the nontrivial covering
transformations of Π that leaves invariant B1. Then, since Σ is embedded, θ induces a diffeomorphism on
B1 and Π|(cid:101)E is injective, θ(∆) is disjoint from ∆. It follows that Π|∆ is injective and so Π : ∆ → N is

eigenfunction f : ∆ → R for the Jacobi operator of ∆ satisfying(cid:82)

an isometric embedding of ∆ into N. Since T is periodic, then ∆ has inﬁnite volume and so N must have
inﬁnite volume, a contradiction with our assumption on N, that implies that the following case must hold.
Case 2: There exists an annular end E of Σ that is contained in a cusp end C of N such that the induced
map i∗ : H1(E) = Z → H1(C) = Z × Z is nontrivial. In particular, there exist two components Σ1, Σ2 of
Π−1(Σ) ⊂ H3 such that Σ1 is contained on the mean convex side of Σ2.
Consider the proper closed region R ⊂ H3 with boundary Σ1 ∪ Σ2 and note that the mean curvature
vector of Σ1 points into R and the mean curvature vector of Σ2 points out of R. Since there are no sur-
faces of constant mean curvature greater than 1 in H3 that are stable (with respect to volume preserving
deformations), then Σ1, and similarly Σ2, contains a smooth compact domain ∆ together with a nonzero
∆ f dA = 0. A standard minimiza-
tion argument described in the next paragraph shows that there exists a stable properly embedded surface
Σ3 ⊂ Int(R) of constant mean curvature H. Since such stable constant mean curvature surfaces do not
exist, then Case 2 cannot occur. This contradiction will then complete the proof of the theorem.
Consider the following variational problem. Fix a smooth compact exhaustion D1 ⊂ D1 . . . Dn ⊂ . . .
of Σ1 and where the domain D1 is unstable. Let Mn be a compact surface embedded in Int(R) with
∂Mn = ∂Dn. Since H3 is simply-connected, Mi ∪ Di is the boundary of a compact region ΩMn ⊂ R. Let
A(Mn) denote the area of Mn and let V (Mn) denote the volume of the region ΩMn. Then, let

I(Mn) = A(Mn) + 2HV (Mn).

By working with integral currents, it is known that there exists a smooth compact, embedded surface(cid:98)Σn ⊂
R of constant mean curvature H with Int((cid:98)Σn) ⊂ Int(R) and ∂(cid:98)Σn = ∂Dn. In fact, (cid:98)Σn can be chosen
to be, and we will assume it is, a minimizer for this variational problem, i.e., I((cid:98)Σn) ≤ I(M ) for any
Int((cid:98)Σn) ⊂ Int(R) is proven in Lemma 3 of [10]. Moreover,(cid:98)Σn separates Ωn into two regions and the mean

5 Appendix.

The proof of item D of Theorem 1.2 used the next elementary intrinsic result for annular ends of complete
surfaces of nonpositive sectional curvature. As we did not ﬁnd its statement in the literature, we present its
proof in this appendix.

Lemma 5.1. Let Σ be a complete surface of ﬁnite topology with nonpositive sectional curvature. Let e be
an end of Σ and E be an annular end representative. Then for any divergent sequence of points {pn}n∈N in
E,

n→∞ IΣ(pn) = I∞

lim

Σ (e) ∈ [0,∞].

Proof. When Σ is simply connected, IΣ is inﬁnite at every point of Σ; hence, the lemma holds in this case.
Assume now that Σ is not simply connected, and thus IΣ(p) < ∞ for every p ∈ Σ. Let e and E be as in the
statement of the lemma and let IE denote the restriction of the injectivity radius function of Σ to E.
{pn}n∈N, {qn}n∈N in E, then

To prove the lemma it sufﬁces to show that given any two intrinsically divergent sequences of points

lim
n→∞ IE(pn) = lim

n→∞ IE(qn).

Arguing by contradiction, we may assume that the sequences satisfy that lim IE(pn) = (cid:96) ∈ [0, ∞) and
lim IE(qn) = L ∈ ((cid:96), ∞]. There exist embedded geodesic loops γn, Γn based respectively at the points pn,
qn with Length(γn) = 2IE(pn) = 2(cid:96)n, Length(Γn) = 2IE(qn) = 2Ln, and such that, for all n ∈ N,

for some ε > 0. After passing to subsequences, we will assume that

(cid:96)n < (cid:96) + ε, Ln > L − ε, L − (cid:96) ≥ 4ε,

(39)

1. the geodesic loops γn form a pairwise disjoint family;
2. for all n, k ∈ N, pn+k lies in the annular subend Wn of E with boundary γn;
3. qn lies in the compact annulus in E bounded by γn and γn+1.
Since IE is continuous and Wn is connected, there exists a point q(cid:48)
Hence, replacing the points qn by the points q(cid:48)
Let En be the compact annulus in E bounded by Γn and Γn+1. By the same argument as in the proof
of Proposition 3.1, since (cid:96) and L are ﬁnite, we may assume that {γn, Γn}n∈N is a collection of pairwise
disjoint curves, with γn ⊂ En.
We claim that there exists a smooth, homotopically nontrivial, simple closed geodesic αn ⊂ Int(En),
with length at most (cid:96)n. Let Λn be the set of simple closed rectiﬁable curves in En homotopic to γn. If
β ∈ Λn admits a point p in β ∩ BE(qn, ε), then Length(β) > 2(cid:96)n. Indeed, if Length(β) ≤ 2(cid:96)n, it would
follow from the triangle inequality and from (39) that, for every x ∈ β we have dE(qn, x) ≤ Ln. Since
BE(qn, Ln) is simply connected, β is homotopically trivial in E, which implies that it is also homotopically
trivial in En, contradicting β ∈ Λn. A similar argument shows that if β admits a point p ∈ BE(qn+1, ε),
then Length(β) ≥ (cid:96)n.

n, we may assume that L is a ﬁnite number.

n ∈ Wn \ Wn+1 with I(q(cid:48)

n) = (cid:96) + ε.

Hence, any minimizing sequence in Λn can be assumed to stay at least at a distance ε from the pair of
points qn, qn+1, where the boundary of En is not smooth. Then standard minimization arguments imply
that there exists a smooth closed geodesic αn ∈ Λn which minimizes the lengths of curves in Λn, and, since
En is an annulus and αn is the generator of the fundamental group of En, αn is a simple closed geodesic.

The Gauss-Bonnet formula implies that each compact annulus An bounded by α1 and αn+1 is ﬂat, thus
E has a subend A∞ that is isometric to a ﬂat cylinder with boundary being a simple closed geodesic. In fact
the ﬂat A∞ is easily seen to be isometric to a metric product of a circle with [0,∞), which implies that the
injectivity radius function has the constant value Length(α1)/2 on A∞. This contradicts (39), proving the
lemma.
