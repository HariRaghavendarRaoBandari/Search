(Dated: March 4, 2016)

We analyze the temporal response of the ﬂuorescence light that is emitted from a dense gas of
cold atoms driven by a laser. When the average interatomic distance is smaller than the wavelength
of the photons scattered by the atoms, the system exhibits strong dipolar interactions and collective
dissipation. We solve the exact dynamics of small systems with diﬀerent geometries and show how
these collective features are manifest in the scattered light properties such as the photon emission
rate, the power spectrum and the second-order correlation function. By calculating these quantities
beyond the weak driving limit, we make progress in understanding the signatures of collective
behavior in these many-body systems. Furthermore, we clarify the role of disorder on the resonance
ﬂuorescence, of direct relevance for recent experimental eﬀorts that aim at the exploration of many-
body eﬀects in dipole-dipole interacting gases of atoms.

Introduction. Strong dipole-dipole interactions are in-
duced in a gas of emitters due to virtual exchange of
photons when the average distance between the emitters
is smaller than the wavelength associated to the emit-
ted photons. In these dense gases, the radiation prop-
erties diﬀer drastically from the dilute case due to the
emergence of collective super- and sub-radiant emission
modes. The unique character of such a system was stud-
ied for the ﬁrst time decades ago in the seminal papers
by Dicke, Lehmberg and Agarwal among others [1–3].

The unprecedented experimental control available
nowadays over the trapping and interactions in ultra-
cold atomic gases [4] has sparked a renewed interest in
the investigation of these fundamentally collective eﬀects.
Experimental measurements of features such as the col-
lective Lamb shift [5–7], suppression of light scattering
and modiﬁed spectra from dense samples of atoms [8–13]
have been recently realized. Theoretical works so far have
been constrained to the study of the limit of very weak
driving [14–21], small systems of two or three atoms [22–
27] or dilute gases under strong driving conditions [28].
These, however, do not provide a complete picture and
leave a number of unanswered questions: (A) How does
the presence of strong laser driving aﬀect the signatures
of cooperativity detectable in the ﬂuorescence photons
scattered from a dipolar system? (B) Photon emission
rate and excitation number have a one-to-one relation in
dilute gases that is broken when the dissipation becomes
collective. Can one observe this phenomenon in a dense
atomic gas? (C) How does the speciﬁc external conﬁgu-
ration of the atoms aﬀect the previous results? I.e., are
there any diﬀerences expected to arise in experimental
setups with atoms in ordered (e.g. optical lattices) and
disordered conﬁgurations?

We tackle the above questions in this paper by per-
forming a detailed theoretical analysis of the excita-
tion number, photon emission rate, power spectrum
and second-order correlations of the far-ﬁeld ﬂuorescence
from a resonantly driven gas of two-level atoms in the

FIG. 1: (Color online) An ensemble of N two-level atoms is
illuminated uniformly by a laser ﬁeld polarized along the z-
axis, which resonantly couples the atomic |g(cid:105) − |e(cid:105) transition
with Rabi frequency Ω. The virtual exchange of photons gives
rise to long-range exchange interactions and collective dissi-
pation when the interatomic distance a between the atoms is
smaller than the wavelength of the transition λ. A photode-
tector is used to detect the emitted photons and obtain the
intensity and spectrum of the resonance ﬂuorescence.

stationary state. We solve numerically the exact dynam-
ics of atomic systems of up to 7 atoms for a broad range
of values of the laser driving. We show that this gives in-
sights into the behavior of larger systems and hence make
the results of this paper of direct relevance to current ex-
perimental eﬀorts that study the eﬀect of dipole-dipole
interactions and collective dissipation in the optical re-
sponse of a cold atomic system in the absence of inho-
mogeneous broadening [8–11]. In particular, in order to
illustrate the important role of the external geometry in
these cold atomic gases, we have analyzed the emission
properties from an ordered system –a one-dimensional
(1D) lattice of atoms– and a three-dimensional (3D) dis-
ordered gas, where the positions of the atoms are chosen
randomly and the results are averaged over many diﬀer-
ent realizations, as it is done experimentally.

The system. We consider an ensemble of N atoms either
conﬁned in an optical lattice or in a disordered gas. All
atoms are initially assumed to be in the electronic ground
state, |g(cid:105). An external laser ﬁeld linearly polarized along
the z-axis is then applied to couple resonantly the two
internal states |g(cid:105) and |e(cid:105). The average interatomic dis-
tance between neighboring atoms, a, is here considered
to be much shorter than the transition wavelength λ (see
Fig. 1). As a consequence, strong long-range interactions
are induced among the atoms and the photon emission
acquires a marked collective character [1–3].

The dynamics of the ensemble is described by the mas-

ter equation

˙ρ = − i

 [H, ρ] + D(ρ),

(1)

where ρ is the atomic density matrix. The many-
body Hamiltonian H, which describes the coherent time-
evolution of this open quantum system, is expressed as

Here we have deﬁned the atomic transition operator
bα ≡ |g(cid:105)α(cid:104)e| for the α-th atom. The atom-laser coupling
strength is given by the Rabi frequency Ω = dE0/(2)
with E0 being the amplitude of the external homogeneous
laser ﬁeld and d the transition dipole moment. The driv-
ing ﬁeld wavevector is denoted by k = kˆy (see Fig. 1)
and the spatial position of the α-th atom is rα. The
long-range coherent interaction between the α-th and β-
th atoms separated by rαβ = rαβˆrαβ is characterized by
the coeﬃcient matrix

(with M containing the eigenvectors of the matrix Γ) as
an operator associated to the emission of a photon and
†
βm as the rate at which such an
emission takes place. The structure of these operators
dictates to which extent the emission and the atomic ex-
citation are coupled, as it will be discussed in the next
section. In a dilute gas where all καβ > 1, the emission
operators are simply Jm ≈ bm and the decay rates are the
single atom ones γm ≈ γ for all m = 1 . . . N , i.e. the pho-
ton emissions occur independently from each individual
atom. However, as καβ decreases, the emission operators
become superpositions of several atomic transition oper-
ators and the incoherent emission of photons occurs by
means of collective superradiant processes with γm > γ
and subradiant ones with γm < γ. While the fraction
of superradiant emission operators depends on the spe-
ciﬁc geometric arrangement and size of the system, it
stays almost constant and small as the system size N is
increased.
In the following, we will denote the largest
collective decay rate γS.
Photon emission in ordered and disordered gases. Our
aim is to explore the signatures of collective behavior
in the light scattered from the system in the stationary
state. One of these signatures, which has been observed
in experiments such as [8] under weak driving conditions
(Ω/γ (cid:28) 1), is the suppression of the photon emission
rate with respect to the dilute case. One can obtain this
intensity in terms of the emission operators and rates
discussed above as

for a 3D random gas, showing the average results of
1000 numerical experiments with diﬀerent positions of
the atoms. We enhance the collective behavior in the
system by decreasing κ = 2πa/λ, where a represents the
average distance between each atom and the one clos-
est to it. We observe indeed strong suppression of the
emission in the limit of weak driving, which is more pro-
nounced the smaller κ is. Beyond this limit, this suppres-
sion, although less pronounced, is still present for values
of the driving Ω comparable to the single atom decay rate
γ. Eventually, for large enough Ω/γ, the suppression dis-

the system sizes explored, which gives an indication that
insights on the behavior of larger systems can be indeed
extracted from these results. In order to explore the im-
portance of the speciﬁc external geometry of the system,
we calculate the ratio Np/N ni
p in a 1D chain perpendic-
ular to the laser momentum with κ = 1/2 [Fig. 2(b)].
While the suppression is more pronounced in this case,
we observe a very similar qualitative behavior to the dis-
ordered case. Again only minor diﬀerences exist between
the results for N = 4, 5, 6 and 7 atoms (shown in the
ﬁgure). The results seem to indicate that the emission
suppression is a very robust feature of these interacting
systems with collective dissipation that survives the ad-
dition of ﬁnite driving and that does not depend on the
speciﬁc spatial arrangement of the atoms.

As we discussed above, in a dilute gas the emission op-
erators coincide with the atomic transition ones. Hence,
here the emission rate (2) is equivalent to the number of

multiplied by the single atom decay rate γ. This relation,
however, does not hold in general as the dissipation ac-
quires a collective character [29, 30]. This feature can be
observed in Figs. 2(c) and (d), where the ratio between
the photon emission rate and the excitation number mul-
tiplied by γ is shown as a function of Ω/γ. In the limit of
very strong driving, both in the case of a 3D random gas
and in a 1D chain this ratio approaches one. For smaller
values of the driving, however, the geometry of the sys-
tem becomes relevant. In the 1D chain [Fig. 2(d)], one
can observe ﬁnite size eﬀects with the ratio Np/(γNe)
changing from larger to smaller than one as we vary the
system size. Note [Fig. 2(c)] that this feature is not
present in the 3D random gas and Np/(γNe) is largely
independent of the system size. While this is true for the
average over many conﬁgurations, the values for each in-
dependent conﬁguration ﬂuctuate notably from one to
another, represented by large error bars. Moreover, we
observe that as κ decreases Np/(γNe) approaches one.

behavior can be found in the spectral properties of the
light emitted by the system. Here, we calculate numer-
ically the power spectrum of the light emitted by the

of weak and strong driving, respectively. We once again
compare the results for a 1D chain and a 3D random
gas with κ = 1/2 (averaged over 1000 realisations). In
all cases we show the spectrum resulting from a dilute
–non-interacting– gas, which in the weak driving regime
is formed by a single peak with width smaller than γ and
in the strong driving one by a so-called Mollow triplet
[31, 32].

When the system is strongly driven [Figs. 3(a) and
(b)], the two geometries show similar features: the inter-
actions in the system lead to a broadening of the three
peaks of the Mollow triplet, with the sideband peaks ap-
pearing slightly shifted away from the central one in the
1D chain. In the weak driving case, however, the geome-
try of the system plays a rather important role. In the 1D
chain we can observe a large number of peaks with width
much larger (smaller) than the single atom one, corre-
sponding to superradiant (subradiant) states [Fig. 3(d)].
Similar conﬁgurations with the peaks appearing in diﬀer-
ent positions are also visible in each individual realisation
in the 3D random case [see insets in Fig. 3(c)]. The av-
eraging process over all these conﬁgurations, where the

depends only on the time delay τ .

Figure 4 displays data of the second-order correlation
g(2)(τ ) at τ = 0 in a dense gas, where we show for com-
parison the results for a dilute one (κ = 10). The ge-
ometry of the atomic ensemble has again a considerable
impact on the form of the correlation function except in
the limit of very strong driving, where its value tends to
the same limit, g(2)(0) = 2(1 − 1/N ) [36]. As it was the
case for Np/(γNe), g(2)(0) in the 1D chain shows strong
ﬁnite size eﬀects [Figure 4(a)]. In particular, when the
number of atoms in the chain is odd one observes bunch-
ing (g(2)(0) > 1) while for even sizes the photon emission
is antibunched [37, 38]. Conversely, in the 3D random gas
[Figure 4(b)] g(2)(0) is largely independent of the system
size. We observe that here the signature of the collec-
tive behavior in the system is a reduction of g(2)(0) with
respect to the dilute case, even going from bunched to
antibunched behavior for κ = 1/2. This is particularly
pronounced in the weak driving limit, where we also ob-
serve large ﬂuctuations around the average [36].
Conclusions. To conclude, let us return to the three ques-
tions posed in the introduction of the paper. (A) In the
strong driving regime we observe suppression of photon
emission rate, although less pronounced than the limit of
weak driving. Moreover, clear signatures of the strong in-
teractions and collective dissipation in this regime are vis-
ible in the broadening of the spectrum (Mollow triplet).
(B) The fact that there is no simple one-to-one relation
between the excitation density and the photon emission
intensity can be observed in this system as a signature of
collective behavior. (C) Finally, we show that in general
the properties of the scattered light in a disordered gas
are qualitatively diﬀerent from the ones obtained from an
ordered conﬁguration. The reason can be found in the
averaging process, that washes out the speciﬁc features
of each single realisation.

We have shown that in a dense ordered gas the inter-

κ = 1/2 in: (a) and (b) show broadening of the Mollow
triplet in the case of strong driving (Ω = 10γ) for a random
3D gas of N = 5 atoms and 1D chain of N = 7 atoms, re-
spectively. (c) In the case of weak driving (Ω = 0.1γ) for a
random 3D gas, the individual realizations give rise to spec-
tra (insets) very diﬀerent from the average one, which can be
ﬁtted with a Lorentzian (green dash-dotted line). For com-
parison, a Lorentzian with width γS is also shown (purple
dotted line). (d) Spectrum of a 1D chain of N = 7 atoms for

diant peaks are shifted in every run gives as a result a sin-
gle Lorentzian-like peak broader than the non-interacting
one. Note that this width is noticeably smaller than the
decay rate of the most superradiant mode γS [8]. Finally,
note that only negligible shifts of the central feature are
observed in the data [11, 13].
Second order correlation function. The second-order cor-
relation of the resonance ﬂuorescence from diﬀerent light
sources has been widely investigated: It has been estab-
lished that a thermal source emits photons in bunches,
while antibunched photon emission is only seen in quan-
tum light [31, 33–35]. We investigate here the second-
order correlation function of the scattered light in our
system, deﬁned as

(cid:10)E(r, t)E(r, t + τ )E†(r, t + τ )E†(r, t)(cid:11)

,

where I(r, t) = E(r, t)E†(r, t). Equation (3) yields the
probability of detecting a photon at time t + τ given that
one was detected at time t divided by the probability
of uncorrelated detection. As the atomic ensemble is in
the stationary state, t → ∞, the intensity correlation

action eﬀects are most pronounced. Experiments that
explore the dense regime in these ordered conﬁgurations
have not been performed yet. Strontium atoms possess a
very long wavelength transition between low-lying levels
and can be trapped in lattices with lattice constant on
the order of a few hundred nm [19]. Hence, they rep-
resent an ideal platform for the observation of collective
eﬀects in dense atomic gases.
