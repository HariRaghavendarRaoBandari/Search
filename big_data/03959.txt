Abstract

In this paper we present an algorithm to compute the real and complex straight
lines contained in a rational surface, deﬁned by a rational parametrization. The
algorithm relies on the well-known theorem of Diﬀerential Geometry that char-
acterizes real straight lines contained in a surface as curves that are simulta-
neously asymptotic lines, and geodesics. We also report on an implementation
carried out in Maple 18. Examples and timings show the eﬃciency of the algo-
rithm for moderate degrees, compared with a brute-force approach.

1. Introduction

Straight lines are certainly notable curves in an algebraic surface. Probably
the most famous result on algebraic surfaces containing straight lines is related
to cubic surfaces: G. Salmon [19], after correspondence with A. Cayley, proved
that projective smooth cubic surfaces contain exactly 27 (projective, complex
and real) straight lines, some of them at inﬁnity. Schl¨aﬃ [20] proved later that
the number of real straight lines must be 3, 7, 15 or 27. If the cubic is singular
[2], the number of straight lines goes down to 21.

Projective nonsingular cubic surfaces happen to be rational surfaces. If a
parametrization of a rational cubic surface is known, one can easily compute the
straight lines contained in the surface from the base points of the parametriza-
tion [2], [3]. However, unlike cubics, surfaces of degree higher than 3 do not
necessarily contain straight lines (see Theorem 1.27 in [23]). Furthermore, in
the aﬃrmative case, up to our knowledge there is no known algorithm other
than the brute-force approach to ﬁnd them.

Computing the straight lines in a surface can be interesting on its own right,
but it provides, additionally, useful information on the surface. If the surface

contains some real line, then the surface is non-compact. Furthermore, knowing
the (complex or real) straight lines contained in a surface helps to ﬁnd the
symmetry center, symmetry planes and symmetry axes, if any, of the surface,
since any of these symmetries maps the straight lines onto each other. Also, this
information can help to identify whether or not two given surfaces are similar,
i.e. equal up to position and scaling, since two similar surfaces contain the same
number of straight lines, that must be mapped to each other.

In this paper we approach the problem of determining the real and complex
straight lines contained in a surface deﬁned by a rational parametrization of any
degree. In order to do this, we exploit the well-known result in Diﬀerential Ge-
ometry that characterizes real non-singular straight lines contained in a surface,
as curves that are simultaneously asymptotic lines, and geodesics. In the com-
plex case, the analogous condition is necessary but not suﬃcient. However, we
show that despite of this diﬃculty, the condition allows to ﬁnd all the complex
and real straight lines in the surface, with the exception of those straight lines
not reached by the parametrization.

The structure of the paper is the following. In Section 2 we provide some
background on rational surfaces and curves contained in surfaces, as well as
several preliminary results that are essential to develop the algorithm. In Section
3 we present the algorithm, and show its correctness. Section 4 reports on
the implementation of the algorithm in the computer algebra system Maple
18. Our conclusions are presented in Section 5.
In Appendix I, we list the
parametrizations used in the examples of Section 4.

In the paper, sometimes we will use the term “line” to refer to a curve
contained in the surface we are analyzing. Hence, not every “line” is a “straight
line”, although the converse statement is, obviously, true.

2. Preliminary results.

In the paper we will work with a rational surface S ⊂ R3, diﬀerent from a

plane, parametrized by

x(t, s) = (x(t, s), y(t, s), z(t, s)),

where x(t, s), y(t, s), z(t, s) are real rational functions. We will consider the
Euclidean space R3 furnished with the usual dot product (cid:104) , (cid:105), and the usual
Euclidean norm (cid:107) · (cid:107).

2.1. Background on surfaces and curves contained in surfaces.

For the convenience of the reader, we recall here some basic deﬁnitions and
results of Diﬀerential Geometry that will be used later in this paper; we refer
to [24], [13] or [7] for further reading on these topics. Let us denote

xt =

∂x
∂t

, xs =

∂x
∂s

.

2

We say that x(t, s) is regular at P0 = x(t0, s0) if (xt × xs)(t0, s0) (cid:54)= 0. At any
regular point P0 = x(t0, s0) ∈ S we can deﬁne the normal vector, N , as

N =

xt × xs
(cid:107)xt × xs(cid:107) .

(1)

We say that x(t, s) is a regular parametrization if it is regular at every point
P = x(t, s).
If x(t, s) is not regular at P0 = x(t0, s0) we say that x(t, s) is
singular at P0. However, we must distinguish between a regular parametrization,
and a regular surface. The singular points of S are the points P = x(t, s) where
xt × xs vanishes, and the self-intersections of S, i.e. the points of S that are
reached by several pairs (t, s). We will denote the set of all the singular points
of S by Sing(S). The surface S is said to be regular if x(t, s) is regular, and S
has no self-intersections; if S is not regular, then it is singular.

The tangent plane to S at a regular point P0 = x(t0, s0) is the plane through
P0, normal to N . The ﬁrst fundamental form of S is a form deﬁned in the
tangent plane by the symmetric matrix

The local shape of S around P0 = x(t0, s0) is captured by another form deﬁned
in the tangent plane, the second fundamental form of S, which is deﬁned by

(cid:29)

If det(II) > 0 at a point P0 ∈ S, we say that P0 is an elliptic point; if det(II) =
0, P0 is a parabolic point; if det(II) < 0, P0 is a hyperbolic point. At an elliptic
point, S is locally at one side of the tangent plane; however, at a hyperbolic
point S goes through the tangent plane, and has points at both sides. We also
introduce the following notation, that will be used in the following subsection:

e(cid:63) = (cid:104)xtt, xt × xs(cid:105),

f (cid:63) = (cid:104)xts, xt × xs(cid:105),

g(cid:63) = (cid:104)xss, xt × xs(cid:105).

(4)

Notice that e(cid:63), f (cid:63), g(cid:63) are the result of multiplying e, f, g by (cid:107)N(cid:107).
Let C ⊂ S be a curve contained in S, parametrized by y(t). Let p = y(t0),
and let {t, n, b} denote the Frenet frame of C at p; recall in particular that t
is the unitary vector parallel to y(cid:48). If s represents the arc-length, the curvature
vector of C at p is deﬁned as

k(p) =

(p).

(5)

Furthermore, the normal curvature, kn, and geodesic curvature, kg, are deﬁned
as

where the above scalar expressions must be evaluated at p. The normal curva-
ture vector, kn, and the geodesic curvature vector, kg, are deﬁned as

kn = kn · N , kg = kg · (N × t),

(7)

so that

k = kn + kg.

We say that C is an asymptotic line of C if kn = 0, and we say that C is a
geodesic line if kg = 0. Since the only curves where the curvature k is identically
0 are the straight lines, one has the following well-known result.
Theorem 1. Let C ⊂ S be a real curve contained in a surface S parametrized by
a regular parametrization x(t, s). If C is parametrized by x(t, s(t)) or x(t(s), s),
where s(t), t(s) are real functions, then C is a straight line iﬀ it is simultaneously
an asymptotic line, and a geodesic line.

We will need the following lemma. Here, L(u, v) represents the linear variety

spanned by the vectors u, v.
Lemma 2. Let C ⊂ S be parametrized by y(t) = x(t, s(t)) for some real function
s(t).
(1) The condition kn = 0 is equivalent to y(cid:48)(cid:48) ∈ L(xt, xs), where y(cid:48)(cid:48) is evalu-

ated at t, and xt, xs at (t, s(t)).

(2) The condition kg = 0 is equivalent to (cid:104)y(cid:48)(cid:48), (xt× xs)× y(cid:48)(cid:105) = 0, where y(cid:48), y(cid:48)(cid:48)

are evaluated at t, and xt, xs at (t, s(t)).

ds ∈ L(y(cid:48), y(cid:48)(cid:48)). Since (cid:104)y(cid:48), N(cid:105) = 0, from
Proof. (1) t is parallel to y(cid:48), and dt
(6), the condition kn = 0 is equivalent to
the deﬁnition of kn given in Eq.
In turn, this condition is equivalent to y(cid:48)(cid:48) ∈ L(xt, xs). (2) It

parallel to y(cid:48), dt

As it is well-known, and can be easily deduced from Lemma 2, a curve

x(t, s(t)), with s(t) a real function, is an asymptotic line of S iﬀ s(t) satiﬁes

which in turn is equivalent to

At any non-parabolic point P ∈ S we have a pair of asymptotic lines, which
if eg − f 2 < 0), and imaginary if the
are real if the point is hyperbolic (i.e.
if eg − f 2 > 0). This is clear from (10); in fact, in those
point is elliptic (i.e.
cases we can compute the Taylor expansion of s(t) using (10). Furthermore, at
dt = −f /g, and therefore we just have one,
a parabolic point (10) reduces to ds
real, asymptotic line through it.

As it is also well-known, and can be deduced from Lemma 2, a curve

Notice that the case t = c, with c a constant, is not included in the discussion
above, since in this case it does not make sense to write s = s(t). However, it
does make sense to write t = t(s). Now by considering analogous formulas to
(8) and (11) in terms of dt
dt , one can see that the coordinate lines
x(c, s) are asymptotic lines iﬀ g = 0, and are geodesics iﬀ Γ1
22 = 0. Therefore,
x(c, s), where c ∈ R, is a straight line iﬀ t− c divides the gcd of the numerators

ds instead of ds

of g(cid:63)(t, s), and(cid:98)Γ1

22(t, s).

2.2. Complex straight lines, and main theorem.

We also want to ﬁnd the complex straight lines contained in S. These lines
can be parametrized as x(t, s(t)) or x(t(s), s), where s(t), t(s) are complex
functions. Hence, while in the previous deﬁnitions and considerations we were
assuming that t, s where real, now we allow t, s to be complex.

Let us examine whether or not the expressions and results of Subsection 2.1
are valid here as well. Now if t, s are allowed to be complex, certain pathologies
arise. These pathologies are derived from the fact that (cid:104) , (cid:105) is not an inner
product in C3, since the positive-deﬁniteness property does not hold anymore.
We observe the following:

• If x(t, s) is well-deﬁned (for t, s complex), then xt, xs and xt × xs (com-
puted by means of a determinant, as in the real case) are also well-deﬁned.
• N is not necessarily well-deﬁned at a complex regular point, since for t, s
complex, (cid:107)xt × xs(cid:107) can vanish even though xt × xs is not zero. For this
reason, the second fundamental form is not necessarily deﬁned. However,
e(cid:63), f (cid:63), g(cid:63) are well-deﬁned.

5

• For a complex t, it can happen that y(cid:48)(t) (cid:54)= 0 but (cid:107)y(cid:48)(t)(cid:107) = 0. In that
case, t is not well-deﬁned, and therefore k, kg, kn are not well-deﬁned
either; notice also that for kg, kn to be well-deﬁned N must exist.

• While for real t, s it is well-known that I > 0, for complex t, s it can
jk (which have I in the denominator)

are not necessarily well-deﬁned, although the(cid:98)Γi

happen that I = 0. Therefore, the Γi

jk are.

Lemma 3. Let y(t) = x(t, s(t)) be a complex straight line (i.e. s(t) is a complex
function such that the imaginary part of y(t) is nonzero) contained in S. Then,
y(t) satisﬁes that: (1) y(cid:48)(cid:48) ∈ L(xt, xs); (2) (cid:104)y(cid:48)(cid:48), (xt × xs) × y(cid:48)(cid:105) = 0.
Proof. (1) y(t) = x(t, s(t)) is a straight line iﬀ y(cid:48)(t), y(cid:48)(cid:48)(t) are linearly dependent
for all t. Since y(cid:48) ∈ L(xt, xs), it follows that y(cid:48)(cid:48) ∈ L(xt, xs) too. Therefore,
condition (1) holds. (2) The triple product (cid:104)y(cid:48)(cid:48), (xt × xs) × y(cid:48)(cid:105) can be written
as a determinant, where the ﬁrst and last rows correspond to the coordinates
of y(cid:48)(cid:48) and y(cid:48) respectively. Since these rows are proportional, the value of the
determinant is zero.
Remark 1. One can prove a completely analogous lemma for curves x(t(s), s) ⊂
S, with t(s) a complex function. In particular, curves x(c, s) with c ∈ C are of
this type.

The conditions of Lemma 3 are exactly the conditions appearing in the state-
ments (1) and (2) of Lemma 2. These conditions imply Eq. (9) and Eq. (12).
However, interestingly enough, while in the real case these two equations char-
acterize straight lines, in the complex case Eq. (9) and Eq. (12) are necessary,
but not suﬃcient. Consider for instance the surface S parametrized by

and let s(t) = i, where i2 = −1. Then y(t) = x(t, i) = (cid:0)it − 1

2 , t2, t + i(cid:1) is a

complex parabola contained in S. One can check that s(t) = i satisﬁes Eq. (9)
and Eq. (12); however, clearly y(t) does not deﬁne a straight line. The next
result sheds some light on the kind of curves contained in S which satisfy Eq.
(9) and Eq. (12), but are not straight lines.

Lemma 4. Let y(t) = x(t, s(t)), with s(t) a complex function, parametrize a
complex curve C ⊂ S. If y(t) satisﬁes Eq. (9) and Eq. (12) but is not a straight
line, then (cid:107)xt × xs(cid:107)2 identically vanishes over the points (t, s(t)).
Proof. Eq. (9) and Eq. (12) are equivalent to conditions (1) and (2) in Lemma
3. Now since (cid:104)y(cid:48)(cid:48), (xt × xs) × y(cid:48)(cid:105) = 0, and since (cid:104)y(cid:48)(cid:48), (xt × xs) × y(cid:48)(cid:105) can be
computed as a determinant consisting of the components of y(cid:48)(cid:48), xt × xs, y(cid:48),
we have y(cid:48)(cid:48) = a(xt × xs) + by(cid:48) for some a, b ∈ C. On the other hand, since
y(cid:48)(cid:48) ∈ L(xt, xs), and y(cid:48) ∈ L(xt, xs) too, we deduce that xt × xs ∈ L(xt, xs).
Hence, there exist c, d ∈ C such that xt × xs = cxt + dxs. Therefore, we have
(13)

(cid:104)xt × xs, xt × xs(cid:105) = c(cid:104)xt, xt × xs(cid:105) + d(cid:104)xs, xt × xs(cid:105).

Now (cid:104)xt, xt × xs(cid:105) can be computed as a determinant whose rows are the com-
ponents of xt, xt and xs, respectively. Since the ﬁrst and third rows of the
determinant are equal, we get (cid:104)xt, xt × xs(cid:105) = 0. Similarly, (cid:104)xs, xt × xs(cid:105) = 0.
So (cid:104)xt × xs, xt × xs(cid:105) = (cid:107)xt × xs(cid:107)2 = 0.
Remark 2. The same condition, i.e. (cid:107)xt× xs(cid:107)2 = 0 is also obtained for curves
x(t(s), s).

(9) and Eq.

If C is parametrized by y(t) = x(t, s(t)), with s(t) a complex function, and
(12) but is not a straight line, we say that
y(t) satisﬁes Eq.
it is a pathological curve. Similarly for curves x(t(s), s), with t(s) a complex
function. We represent by V the union of all the pathological curves contained
in S. Since x(t, s) is, by hypothesis, a real parametrization, the singular locus
of S is at most 1-dimensional, i.e. (cid:107)xt × xs(cid:107)2 is not identically zero; therefore
we get the following result.
Lemma 5. The dimension of V is at most 1.

Finally, we have the following theorem, which expresses a necessary condition
for a curve C ⊂ S to be a (real or complex) straight line. According to the above
considerations, the condition is suﬃcient in the real, but not the complex, case.
Theorem 6. Let C ⊂ S be a (possibly complex) straight line contained in the
surface S, parametrized by a regular parametrization x(t, s).
(1) If C is parametrized by x(t, s(t)), then s(t) satisﬁes satisfy Eq. (9) and

Eq. (12).

(2) If C is parametrized by x(c, s), then t − c divides the gcd η(t, s) of the

numerator of g(cid:63)(t, s) and the numerator of (cid:98)Γ1

22(t, s).

2.3. Ruled surfaces.

A surface S is said to be ruled if at every point P ∈ S there exists a (real
or complex) straight line LP through P contained in S. The straight lines
contained in a ruled surface are called rulings or generatrices of the surface.
Ruled surfaces of degree higher than two can be characterized by means of the
Pick’s invariant of the surface, which is deﬁned as J = K − H, where K is
the Gauss’ curvature of the surface and H is the mean curvature of the surface.
Ruled surfaces that are not quadrics are exactly those ones with vanishing J
(see pages 89, 90 of [12]).

3. Computing the straight lines contained in a rational surface.

Since S admits a rational parametrization x(t, s) = (x(t, s), y(t, s), z(t, s)),
the coeﬃcients E, F, G of the ﬁrst fundamental form of S, the coeﬃcients e, f, g
of the second fundamental form of S, and the Christoﬀel symbols Γi
jk are rational
jk. We will also assume

functions of t, s. Similarly for e(cid:63), f (cid:63), g(cid:63) and the (cid:98)Γi

7

that this parametrization is proper, i.e.
equivalently that the mapping

injective for almost all points of S, or

C2 →
(t, s) → x(t, s),

S

is birational. One can check properness by using the algorithms in [14, 15]; for
reparametrization questions one can see [16, 17]. Additionally, let us also recall
the notion of normality. We say that the parametrization x(t, s) is normal if it
is surjective, i.e. if every point of S is reached via x by some pair of parameters
(t, s) ∈ C2. This problem has been well studied for the case of rational planar
curves [22]. Furthermore, the question has been addressed in [1, 4] for special
kinds of surfaces, and also in [18, 21], where partial results on the problem are
presented. If a parametrization x(t, s) is not normal, then the set of points not
covered by the parametrization has at most dimension 1, i.e. it is at most the
union of ﬁnitely many space curves and ﬁnitely many points.

Our goal is to ﬁnd the straight lines contained in S that are covered by the
parametrization x(t, s). In order to do this, we will ﬁrst address the computa-
tion of the straight lines contained in the regular part of S, i.e. in S\Sing(S).
Afterwards, we will see how to compute the straight lines contained in Sing(S).

3.1. Straight lines contained in the regular part of S.

Our approach is based on Theorem 6. We ﬁrst look for curves C (locally)
parametrized as x(t, s(t)), where s(t) satisﬁes both (9) and (12). The curves
x(c, s), with c a constant, are not included here, but they can be found by
applying statement (2) of Theorem 6. Now let ω = ds
dt . From Equation (9) we
have that

e(cid:63) + 2f (cid:63) · ω + g(cid:63) · ω2 = 0,

(14)

(15)

where e(cid:63), f (cid:63), g(cid:63) appear in Eq. (4). We distinguish the following two cases:

(i) If f (cid:63) or g(cid:63) are not identically 0 then f (cid:63) + g(cid:63)ω, seen as a polynomial in ω,
is not identically 0 either. From the Implicit Function Theorem, whenever
f (cid:63)+g(cid:63)ω (cid:54)= 0 we have that Eq. (14) implicitly deﬁnes ω = ω(t, s). Denoting
γ = dω

dt and diﬀerentiating (14) with respect to the variable t, we get

A(t, s, ω) · γ + B(t, s, ω) = 0,

where A(t, s, ω) = 2(f (cid:63) + g(cid:63)ω). The straight lines consisting of points of
S where f (cid:63) + g(cid:63)ω = 0, if any, must be determined separately.

(ii) If f (cid:63) = g(cid:63) = 0 then e(cid:63) cannot be identically 0, because otherwise S is a
plane (see pg. 147 of [7]), which is excluded by hypothesis. Hence (14)
reduces to e(cid:63)(t, s) = 0. If e(cid:63)(t, s) = e(cid:63)(t) then we just need to look for lines
that can be parametrized as x(c, s) with c a constant, which can be done
by applying statement (2) of Theorem 6. Otherwise, e(cid:63)(t, s) = 0 implicitly

From (15) and (16), after clearing denominators and eliminating γ we get a

polynomial relationship between t, s, ω,

˜N (t, s, ω) = 0.

(17)

Let ˜M (t, s, ω) be the polynomial obtained by clearing denominators in (14), and
let M (t, s, ω), N (t, s, ω) be the primitive parts of ˜M (t, s, ω) and ˜N (t, s, ω) with
respect to ω. Finally, let ˜ξ(t, s) be the resultant of M (t, s, ω) and N (t, s, ω)
with respect to ω, and let ξ(t, s) be the result of removing from ξ(t, s) the
denominators of the components of x(t, s) and the denominators of (14), (15),
(16), if any.

In order to ﬁnd the straight lines contained in S, we must examine the space
curve consisting of the points x(t, s) with ξ(t, s) = 0. Besides, we must also
check some other space curves, namely the curves parametrized by x(t, s) with
δj(t, s) = 0, j = 1, . . . , 3, where:

(a) δ1(t, s) is the gcd of the coeﬃcients of the numerator of A(t, s, ω), seen as

a polynomial of degree 1 in ω.

(b) δ2(t, s) is the product of the contents of ˜M (t, s, ω) and ˜N (t, s, ω) with

respect to ω.

(c) δ3(t, s) is the condition, similar to ξ(t, s), for the straight lines consisting
of points x(t, s) where f (cid:63) + g(cid:63)ω = 0. Here ω = −f (cid:63)/g(cid:63), so we compute
γ = −dω/dt, and proceed as before to obtain δ3(t, s).

Therefore, let

µ(t, s) = ξ(t, s) · δ1(t, s) · δ2(t, s) · δ3(t, s).

Additionally, we will denote by Sx the set of points x(t, s) of S where xt×xs = 0;
notice that Sx ⊂ Sing(S), although in general Sx (cid:54)= Sing(S) (because Sing(S)
also contains the self-intersections of S).
Theorem 7. Suppose that the polynomial µ(t, s) is not identically zero. Let L
be a straight line contained in the surface S, and covered by the parametrization
x(t, s), that is not a coordinate line x(c, s), with c a constant.
(i) If L (cid:54)⊂ Sx, there exists an irreducible component EL of µ(t, s) = 0, seen

as a curve in the (t, s) plane, such that x (EL) = L.

(ii) If L (cid:54)⊂ Sing(S), then EL is rational. Furthermore, if (φ1(z), φ2(z)) is a

rational parametrization of EL, then x(φ1(z), φ2(z)) = L.

9

Proof. (i) Let E denote the curve in the (t, s) plane deﬁned by µ(t, s) = 0, and let
L be a straight line contained in S that can be locally parametrized as x(t, s(t)).
From Theorem 6 and by construction, L ⊂ x(E). Since L is irreducible, L must
be the image of some irreducible component EL of E (see Theorem 1.26 of [23]).
(ii) Since the points of L are not, all of them, self-intersections of S and x is
proper, the restriction ˜x = x|EL : EL → L is birational onto its image (see
Section 2.2.4 of [22]). Now since the genus is a birational invariant and L is
rational, EL = ˜x−1 (L) is also rational.

Remark 3. In general, we need the irreducible components of µ(t, s) over the
complex numbers. The problem of computing an absolute factorization, i.e. of
factoring over the complex numbers, has been addressed in a number of papers,
see for instance [5], [6], [8], [10], [11].
In our case, we used the command
AFactors of Maple 18, which works ﬁnely for polynomials of moderate and
medium degrees.

Notice that there can be components of µ(t, s) = 0 that do not correspond
to any line on S. In the case of complex irreducible components this is not a
surprise, since we saw in Subsection 2.2 that the converse of Theorem 6 is not
true in the complex case. However, it can even happen with real components of
µ(t, s). But this is not contradictory either, since in the process to compute the
polynomial µ(t, s) we treat ω as an independent variable, without taking into
account the (diﬀerential) relationship ω = ds
dt .

In order to apply Theorem 7 for ﬁnding the straight lines contained in S,
it is required that the polynomial µ(t, s) is not identically zero, which happens
iﬀ ξ(t, s) or δ3(t, s) are not identically zero. We will show that this situation
corresponds exactly to the case when S is a ruled surface, and therefore contains
inﬁnitely many straight lines. We ﬁrst need the following lemma; since we could
not ﬁnd any appropriate reference in the literature, we provide here a complete
proof.

Lemma 8. Let S be an algebraic surface. If S contains inﬁnitely many straight
lines, then S is a ruled surface.

Proof. Let X be the algebraic set of all the straight lines (cid:96) contained in S, the
Zariski closure of S, which is contained in the grassmannian G(1, 3) of lines in
the complex projective space P3. Furthermore, let I = {(x, (cid:96)) | x ∈ ¯S, (cid:96) ∈ X}.
Now consider the incidence diagram:

I

p

q

S

X

Since S contains inﬁnitely many straight lines, we have dimX ≥ 1. Addi-
tionally p(I) is the union of the elements of X, considered as straight lines in
P3. Since p(I) is an inﬁnite union of diﬀerent straight lines it cannot be a curve,

10

 
 


so dim(p(I)) ≥ 2. Therefore p(I) is a closed surface contained in the irreducible
surface S. Hence p(I) = S, so p is surjective. Thus, for all x ∈ S there is a
straight line (cid:96) ∈ X passing through x (equivalently, S is the union of its lines).
Hence S is ruled, and so is S.

Now we are ready to prove the result. We recall here the polynomial η(t, s)

appearing in statement (2) of Theorem 6.

Theorem 9. A rational surface S properly parametrized by x(t, s) is a ruled
surface if and only some of the polynomials µ(t, s), η(t, s) are identically zero.
Proof. (⇒) If S is ruled then S contains inﬁnitely many straight lines. However,
if µ(t, s), η(t, s) are not identically zero then they have ﬁnitely many irreducible
components. Therefore, by Theorem 7 and since Sing(S) has at most dimension
1, there should be inﬁnitely many straight lines uncovered by the parametriza-
tion. But this cannot happen, because the set of points of S not covered by
x(t, s) has dimension at most 1.
(⇐) If η(t, s) is identically zero then any coordinate line x(c, s), with c a
real constant, is a straight line. Since we have one coordinate line of this type
through every point, then S is ruled. So assume that µ(t, s) is identically zero, in
which case either ξ(t, s) or δ3(t, s) is identically zero. We will assume that ξ(t, s)
is identically zero; the case when δ3(t, s) is identically zero can be addressed in a
similar way. Thus, let M, N denote the algebraic surfaces in the (t, s, ω)-space
deﬁned by M (t, s, ω) and N (t, s, ω). If ξ(t, s) is identically zero, then M, N
share a component P (t, s, ω) = 0. Now we have diﬀerent cases, depending on
whether M has degree two, degree one (when g(cid:63) = 0) or degree zero (when
g(cid:63) = f (cid:63) = 0); we will address the case when M has degree two, which is the
most diﬃcult one; the other two cases are left to the reader.
Assuming that M has degree two in ω, and since M is primitive with respect
to the variable ω (because its content with respect to ω was removed), M has
at most two irreducible components, corresponding to

−f (cid:63) +(cid:112)(f (cid:63))2 − 4e(cid:63)g(cid:63)

ω =

, ω =

−f (cid:63) −(cid:112)(f (cid:63))2 − 4e(cid:63)g(cid:63)

e(cid:63)

.

Without loss of generality, we will assume that P (t, s, ω) = 0 contains the graph
of

e(cid:63)

ω =

−f (cid:63) +(cid:112)(f (cid:63))2 − 4e(cid:63)g(cid:63)

e(cid:63)

.

We have now two possibilities, depending on whether there exists an open
set Ω ⊂ R2 where (f (cid:63))2 − e(cid:63)g(cid:63) ≥ 0, or not. We focus on the aﬃrmative case;
the negative case will be addressed later. Let Ω ⊂ R2 be an open set where
(f (cid:63))2 − e(cid:63)g(cid:63) ≥ 0, e(cid:63) (cid:54)= 0, and all the Christoﬀel’s symbols are well-deﬁned. By
Picard-Lindel¨of’s Theorem, for any (t0, s0) ∈ Ω the initial value problem

has a unique, real, solution, s(t), deﬁned over an interval I containing t0. By
construction, the space curve C1 (in the (t, s, ω)-space) parametrized by

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

t, s(t),

ds
dt

(t)

,

with t ∈ I ⊂ R, t0 ∈ I, is contained in the surface P (t, s, ω) = 0. Now let
ω0 = ds

dt (t0). Also by Picard-Lindel¨of’s Theorem, the initial value problem

(cid:40) dw

= ψ(t, s(t), ω),

dt

ω(t0) =

ω0

where ψ(t, s(t), ω) represents the right hand-side of Equation (16) evaluated at
s = s(t), has a unique, real, solution ω(t). Again, by construction the space
curve C2 parametrized by

(t, s(t), ω(t)) ,

with t ∈ J, t0 ∈ J, is contained in the surface P (t, s, ω) = 0. Now since C1,
C2 are two analytic curves contained in the surface P (t, s, ω) = 0, sharing the
point (t0, s0, ω0), and projecting onto the same curve (t, s(t)) of the ts-plane for
t ∈ I ∩ J, then C1 and C2 must coincide. So s(t) satisﬁes both Equation (9) and
Equation (12) and s(t) is real, by Theorem 1 x(t, s(t)) must be a straight line
through the point P0 = x(t0, s0). Since this construction is valid for (t0, s0) ∈
Ω, we conclude that S contains inﬁnitely many straight lines. But then the
implication follows from Lemma 8.
If f 2 − eg < 0 for all (t, s) ∈ R2, so that all the points of S are elliptic, we
proceed as before replacing Picard-Lindel¨of’s Theorem by the Complex Exis-
tence and Uniqueness Theorem for diﬀerential equations in the complex domain
(see for instance Theorem 2.2.1 in [9]). This way, we construct inﬁnitely many
curves contained in S, satifying Equation (9) and Equation (12). Taking Lemma
5 into account, only ﬁnitely many of them can be pathological lines; therefore,
we also get inﬁnitely many straight lines contained in S, so S is ruled.

3.2. Straight lines contained in the singular part of S.

The computation of the straight lines contained in the regular part of S
was addressed in Subsection 3.1. So now we want to ﬁnd the straight lines
contained in Sing(S). In order to do this, we separately consider the straight
lines contained in Sx, and in Sing(S)\Sx. The ﬁrst ones do not correspond to
irreducible components of µ(t, s) = 0. However, they correspond to irreducible
components of ν(t, s) = 0, where ν(t, s) is the numerator of (cid:107)xt × xs(cid:107)2. On
the other hand, by statement (i) of Theorem 7, the straight lines contained in
Sing(S)\Sx correspond to irreducible components µi(t, s) = 0 of µ(t, s) = 0.
However, since we are seeking straight lines contained in the singular locus, the
criterion that stems from statement (ii) of Theorem 7 cannot be used to detect
whether or not µi(t, s) = 0 gives rise to a straight line. Therefore, we need

12

another criterion to check whether or not a set of points x(t, s) with α(t, s) = 0,
where α(t, s) is an irreducible component of either ν(t, s) or µ(t, s), is a straight
line. This new criterion is given in the following proposition.
Proposition 10. Let C be the set of points of C3 parametrized by x(t, s) with
α(t, s) = 0, where α(t, s) is irreducible and depends explicitly on s. Then C is a
straight line if and only if there exists a rational function λ(t, s) and a constant
vector u such that the following equality

(xtαs − xsαt, ytαs − ysαt, ztαs − zsαt) = λ(t, s) · u

(18)

holds modulo α(t, s).

Proof. If α(t, s) depends on s, then from the Implicit Function Theorem α(t, s) =
0 (locally) deﬁnes s = s(t). Furthermore, ds
vector to a point of C is parallel to

dt = −αt/αs. Using this, the tangent

(xtαs − xsαt, ytαs − ysαt, ztαs − zsαt).

Then the condition in the statement of the lemma is equivalent to the unitary
tangent to C being constant.

In order to check condition (18), one proceeds in the following way.
1. Let t = a ∈ Z. Then (a, b), where m(b) = α(a, b) = 0, is a point of the

curve α(t, s) = 0.

2. Let w(t, s) = (xtαs − xsαt, ytαs − ysαt, ztαs − zsαt), and let w0 be the

result of evaluating w(t, s) at the point t = a, s = b.

3. C is a straight line iﬀ all the components of w(t, s) × w0 are divisible by

α(t, s). Furthermore, in the aﬃrmative case C is parallel to w0.

Remark 4. If we a priori know that S is regular, then the criterion in Theorem
7 suﬃces. Otherwise, it is preferable to apply the criterion in Proposition 10
to all the components of µ(t, s) = 0. Indeed, we might identify the components
of µ(t, s) = 0 giving rise to regular points of S, and then apply the criterion
in Theorem 7 to those components. However, identifying the components of
µ(t, s) = 0 giving rise to regular points of S can be computationally costly.

3.3. The whole algorithm.

Finally we can derive the following algorithm, Algorithm STLines, to com-

pute the straight lines contained in S.

4. Experimentation.

In this section we provide a detailed example of the algorithm STLines,
as well as timings corresponding to several other examples. Furthermore, we
compare these timings with the timings corresponding to a brute-force approach.
All the examples have been run in an Intel Core computer, revving up at 2.90
GHz, with 8 Gb of RAM memory.

4.1. A detailed example.

Consider the surface S parametrized by

x(t, s) = (−s3 + 3st2 + 3s, 3s2t − t3 + 3t, 3s2 − 3t2).

This is a minimal surface of degree 9, called the Enneper surface. Equation (14)
yields

(−54)(ω − 1)(ω + 1)(s2 + t2 + 1)4 = 0,

(19)

(20)

(21)

while (17) yields

2(ω2 + 1)(−tw + s) = 0.

Hence M (t, s, ω) = ω2 − 1, N (t, s, ω) = 2(ω2 + 1)(−tw + s), and then

ξ(t, s) = 16(−t + s)(t + s).

Furthermore, δ1(t, s) = s2 + t2 + 1 and δ2(t, s) = (s2 + t2 + 1)2. Additionally,
A(t, s, ω) = f + gω = −54(s2 + t2 + 1)2 · ω; hence, A(t, s, ω) = 0 implies ω = 0,
and by substituting ω = 0 in Equation (20) we get δ3(t, s) = 2s. Therefore,

µ(t, s) = (t − s) · (t + s) · (s2 + t2 + 1)3 · s.

We observe that the curve µ(t, s) = 0 has four irreducible components. Let us
analyze each one.
(1) The component t− s = 0 is obviously rational. Plugging s = t into x(t, s),

we get

x(t, t) = (2s3 + 3s, 2s3 + 3s, 0),

which deﬁnes a straight line through (0, 0, 0) parallel to the vector (1, 1, 0).
(2) The component t + s = 0 is again rational. Plugging s = −t into x(t, s),

we get

x(t,−t) = (2s3 + 3s,−2s3 − 3s, 0),

which deﬁnes a straight line through (0, 0, 0) parallel to the vector (1,−1, 0).
However, in order to illustrate the criterion of Subsection 3.2, let us see
how to use this criterion here. Now let α(t, s) = t − s, and let also a = 1,
so that m(b) = 1 − b. Furthermore,

w(t, s) = (3s2 − 6st − 3t2 − 3,−3s2 − 6st + 3t2 − 3,−6s + 6t).

After evaluating w(t, s) at t = 1, s = 1, we get

w0 = w(1, 1) = (−9,−9, 0).

Hence,

w(t, s) × w0 = (54s − 54t,−54s + 54t, 54s2 − 54t2).

Therefore, we observe that all the components of w(t, s)× w0 are divisible
by α(t, s) = t − s, so α(t, s) = 0 certainly corresponds to a straight line
contained in S.

15

which clearly does not correspond to a straight line. However, let us check
what the criterion of Subsection 3.2 yields in this case. First, we have
α(t, s) = t2 + s2 + 1; furthermore, we pick t = 1, so that m(b) = b2 + 2.
Now

w(t, s) = (18s2t − 6t3 − 6t, 6s3 − 18st2 + 6s,−24st).

Furthermore,

w0 = w(1, b) = (18b2 − 12, 6b3 − 12b,−24b).

Therefore,
w(t, s) × w0 = (144bs(s2 − 3t2 + 4t + 1),−1152st − 24b(18s2t − 6t3 − 6t),

−288s3 + 864t2s − 288s + 24b(18s2t − 6t3 − 6t)),

and one can easily see that t2 + s2 + 1 does not, for instance, divide the
ﬁrst component. So certainly from the criterion in criterion of Subsection
3.2 we get that t2 + s2 + 1 = 0 does not give rise to any straight line of S.

(4) The component s = 0 is also rational. Plugging s = 0 into x(t, s), we get

x(t, 0) = (0,−t3 + 3t,−3t2),

which does not correspond to a line.

Now we need to ﬁnd the straight lines contained in the singular part of

x(t, s), i.e. in the set of points where xt × xs = 0. Since
(cid:107)xt × xs(cid:107)2 = 81(t2 + s2 + 1)4,

we get t2 + s2 + 1 = 0, which had already been analyzed.

Finally, one can check that

η(t, s) = gcd(g(cid:63)(t, s), num

(cid:16)(cid:98)Γ1

(cid:17)

22(t, s)

) = 1,

and therefore there are no straight lines of the type x(c, s), where c is a constant.
The whole computation takes 0.078 seconds. Figure 1 shows a picture of the
surface, together with the two straight lines we have computed.

16

Figure 1: Straight lines contained in an Enneper surface.

4.2. Implementation and timings.

In this subsection, we compare timings of the implementation of our algo-
rithm with the timings of a brute-force approach, both implemented in Maple
18, for several rational surfaces. For the brute-force approach, we: (1) compute
the implicit equation F (x, y, z) = 0 of the surface; (2) substitute x := a1t + b1,
y := a2t + b2, z := a3t + b3, where t is a parameter, into F (x, y, z) = 0; (3) we
get a polynomial in the variable t that must be identically zero: this condition
leads to a polynomial system in ai, bi; (4) the (real or complex) solutions where
some ai is nonzero, correspond to the straight lines contained in the surface.

We show the results in Table 1. The column labeled “Degree” contains the
degree of the rational parametrization, i.e. the maximum of the degrees of the
numerators and denominators of the components of the parametrization. “Time
1” corresponds to the timing of our algorithm, while “Time 2” corresponds to
the timing of the brute-force approach. “n(cid:96)” corresponds to the number of
straight lines computed by our algorithm; notice that our algorithm computes
only the straight lines covered by the parametrization. Finally, in “Obs.” we
have included certain observations on the surface. In the columns corresponding
to Time 1 and Time 2, we show the best timing in bold; furthermore, whenever
the timing exceeds 600 seconds, we write (cid:63). The parametrizations used in the
examples are listed in Appendix I.

In the case of the Clebsch surface, the algorithm detects 18 straight lines
because there are 6 lines not covered by the parametrization, and 3 lines at
inﬁnity; so 18 + 6 + 3 = 27.

Basically, the brute-force approach beats our method in cases when the
computation of the implicit equation is very fast.
In a generic situation our
method is better; in fact, in cases like S4, S7, S10, S13, S14 the brute-force
approach is not able to provide an answer in a reasonable amount of time.

5. Conclusions.

We have presented an algorithm to compute the straight lines contained in
an algebraic surface, deﬁned by a rational parametrization. The algorithm is
based in the well-known result in Diﬀerential Geometry characterizing real, non-
singular straight lines contained in a surface as lines which are simultaneously
asymptotic lines, and geodesic lines. Experiments conducted on non-trivial
examples with moderate degrees, show that our method is better than the brute-
force approach.

The method can certainly be generalized to the case of implicit algebraic sur-
faces. In that case, we need to use the Implicit Function Theorem to write the
coeﬃcients of the ﬁrst and second fundamental forms and the Christoﬀel sym-
bols in terms of x, y, z. Afterwards, some auxiliary variables must be properly
eliminated. However, the experiments we have tried show that this approach
is not better than the brute-force approach. For this reason, we have left the
implicit case out of the paper.
