Non-Degeneracy of Kobayashi Volume Measures for

Singular Directed Varieties

Ya Deng

Abstract

In this note, we prove the generic Kobayashi volume measure hyperbolicity of singular
directed varieties (X, V ), as soon as the canonical sheaf KV of V is big in the sense of
Demailly.

Introduction

Let (X, V ) be a complex directed manifold, i.e X is a complex manifold equipped with a holo-
morphic subbundle V ⊂ TX. Demailly’s philosophy in introducing directed manifolds is that,
there are certain fonctorial constructions which work better in the category of directed mani-
folds (ref. [Dem12]), even in the “absolute case”, i.e. the case V = TX. Therefore, it is usually
inevitable to allow singularities of V , and V can be seen as a coherent subsheaf of TX such
that TX /V is torsion free. In this case V is a subbundle of TX outside an analytic subset of
codimension at least 2, which is denoted by Sing(V ). The Kobayashi volume measure can also
be deﬁned for (singular) directed manifolds.

Deﬁnition 1.1. Let (X, V ) be a directed manifold with dim(X) = n and rank(V ) = r. Then
the Kobayashi volume measure of (X, V ) is the pseudometric deﬁned on any ξ ∈ ∧rVx for
x /∈ Sing(V ), by

er
X,V (ξ) := inf{λ > 0; ∃f : Br → X, f (0) = x, λf∗(τ0) = ξ, f∗(TBr ) ⊂ V },

where Br is the unit ball in Cr and τ0 = ∂
say that (X, V ) is generic volume measure hyperbolic if er

∂t1 ∧ ··· ∂

∂tr

is the unit r-vector of Cr at the origin. We

X,V is generically positive deﬁnite.

In [Dem12] the author also introduced the deﬁnition of canonical sheaf KV for any singular
directed variety (X, V ), and he showed that the “bigness” of KV will imply that, any non-
constant entire curve f : C → (X, V ) must satisfy certain global algebraic diﬀerential equations.
In this note, we will study the Kobayashi volume measure of the singular directed variety (X, V ),
and give another intrinsic explanation for the bigness of KV . Our main theorem is as follows:
Theorem 1.1. Let (X, V ) be a compact complex directed variety (V is singular) with rank(V ) =
r and dim(X) = n.
If V is of general type (see Deﬁnition 2.1 below), with the base locus
Bs(V ) ( X (see also Deﬁnition 2.1), then Kobayashi volume measure of (X, V ) is non-degenerate
outside Bs(V ). In particular (X, V ) is generic volume measure hyperbolic.

Remark 1.1. In the absolute case, Theorem 1.1 is proved in [Gri71] and [KO71]; for the smooth
directed variety it is proved in [Dem12].

2 Proof of main theorem

Proof. Since the singular set Sing(V ) of V is an analytic set of codimension ≥ 2, the top
exterior power ∧rV of V is a coherent sheaf of rank 1, and is included in its bidual ∧rV ∗∗, which
is an invertible sheaf (of course, a line bundle). We will give an explicit construction of the
multiplicative cocycle which represent the line bundle ∧rV ∗∗.
Since V ⊂ TX is a coherent sheaf, we can take an open covering {Uα} satisfying that on
each Uα one can ﬁnd sections e(α)
kα ∈ Γ(Uα, TX|Uα) which generate the coherent sheaf V
on Uα. Thus the sections e(α)
ir ∈ Γ(Uα,∧rTX|Uα) with (i1, . . . , ir) varying among all
r-tuples of (1, . . . , kα) generate the coherent sheaf ∧rV |Uα, which is a subsheaf of ∧rTX|Uα. Let
v(α)
is
I
contained in Sing(V ), and thus all v(α)
are proportional outside Sing(V ). Therefore there exists
a unique vα ∈ Γ(Uα,∧rTX|Uα), and holomorphic functions {λI} which do not have common
factors, such that v(α)
I = λI vα for all I. By this construction we can show that on Uα ∩ Uβ, vα
and vβ coincide up to multiplication by a nowhere vanishing holomorphic function, i.e.

ir , then by Cod(Sing(V )) ≥ 2 we know that the common zero of all v(α)

1 , . . . , e(α)

i1 ∧ ··· ∧ e(α)

I

I

vα = gαβvβ

on Uα ∩ Uβ 6= ∅, where gαβ ∈ O∗
X (Uα ∩ Uβ). This multiplicative cocycle {gαβ} corresponds to
the line bundle ∧rV ∗∗. Then ﬁx a K¨ahler metric ω on X, it will induce a metric Hr on ∧rTX
and thus also induce a singular hermitian metric hs of ∧rV ∗∗∗ whose local weight ϕα is equal
to log |vα|2
Hr . It is easy to show that hs has analytic singularities, and the set of singularities
Sing(hs) = Sing(V ). Indeed, we have Sing(hs) = ∪α{p ∈ Uα|vα(p) = 0}. Now we make the
following deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 2.1. With the notions above, V is called to be of general type if there exists a
singular metric h on ∧rV ∗∗∗ with analytic singularities satisfying the following two conditions:
(1) The curvature current Θh ≥ ǫω, i.e., it is a K¨ahler current.
(2) h is more singular than hs, i.e., there exists a globally deﬁned quasi-psh function χ which is

bounded from above such that

eχ · h = hs.

Since h and hs has both analytic singularities, χ also has analytic singularities, and thus eχ is
a continuous function. Moreover, eχ(p) > 0 if p /∈ Sing(h). We deﬁne the base locus of V to be

Bs(V ) := ∩hSing(h),

where h varies among all singular metric on ∧rV ∗∗∗ satisfying the Properties (1) and (2) above.
Now ﬁx a point p /∈ Bs(V ), then by Deﬁnition 2.1 we can ﬁnd a singular metric h with
Let f be any holomorphic map from the unit ball Br ⊂ Cr to (X, V ) such that f (0) = p,

analytic singularities satisfying the Property (1) and (2) above, and p /∈ Sing(h).
then locally we have

f∗(

∂
∂t1 ∧ ··· ∧

∂

) = a(α)(t) · vα|f ,

where a(α)(t) is meromorphic functions, with poles contained in f −1(Sing(V )), and satisﬁes

Since f∗( ∂

ω = |a(α)(t)|2 · |vα|2

|f∗(

where φα is the local weight of h. By Property (2) above, we have a globally deﬁned quasi-psh
function χ on X which is bounded from above such that

δ(t) = eχ · |f∗(

∂
∂t1 ∧ ··· ∧

∂
∂tr

ω ≤ C1.

Now we deﬁne a semi-positive metric eγ on Br by putting eγ := f ∗ω, then we have

where C0(z) is a bounded function on X which does not depend on f , and we take C2 to be its

By the arbitrariness of f , and Deﬁnition 1.1, we conclude that (X, V ) is generic volume measure

X,V is non-degenerate outside Bs(V ).

Remark 2.1. If V is regular, then V is of general type if and only if ∧rV is a big line bundle.
In this situation, the base locus Bs(V ) = B+(∧rV ), where B+(∧rV ) is the augmented base locus
for the big line bundle ∧rV (ref. [Laz04]).

With the notions above, we deﬁne the coherent ideal sheaf I(V ) to be germ of holomorphic
functions which is locally bounded with respect to hs, i.e., I(V ) is the integral closure of the ideal
generated by the coeﬃcients of vα in some local trivialization in ∧rTX. Let ∧rV ∗∗∗ be denoted
by KV , and KV := KV ⊗ I(V ), then KV is the canonical sheaf of (X, V ) deﬁned in [Dem12]. It
is easy to show that the zero scheme of I(V ) is equal to Sing(hs) = Sing(V ). KV is called to be
a big sheaf iﬀ for some log resolution µ : eX → X of I(V ) with µ∗I(V ) = O eX (−D), µ∗KV − D
is big in the usual sense. Now we have the following statement:
Proposition 2.1. V is of general type if and only if KV is big. Moreover, we have
Bs(V ) ⊂ µ(B+(µ∗KV − D)) ∪ Sing(hs) = µ(B+(µ∗KV − D)) ∪ Sing(V ).

Proof. From Deﬁnition 2.1, the condition that KV is a big sheaf implies that KV and µ∗KV − D
are both big line bundles. For m ≫ 0, we have the following isomorphism

µ∗ : H 0(X, (mKV − A) ⊗ I(V )m)

(2.3)
Fix an very ample divisor A, then for m ≫ 0, the base locus (in the usual sense) B(mµ∗KV −
mD − µ∗A) is stably contained in B+(µ∗KV − D) (ref. [Laz04]). Thus we can take a m ≫ 0
to choose a basis s1, . . . , sk ∈ H 0(eX, mµ∗KV − mD − µ∗A), whose common zero is contained in
B+(µ∗KV − D). Then by (2.3) there exists {ei}1≤i≤k ⊂ H 0(X, (mKV − A) ⊗ I(V )m) such that

≈−→ H 0(eX, mµ∗KV − µ∗A − mD).

µ∗(ei) = si.

Then we can deﬁne a singular metric hm on mKV − A by putting |ξ|2

(mKV − A)x. We take a smooth metric hA on A such that the curvature ΘA ≥ ǫω is a smooth
K¨ahler form. Then h := (hmhA)
m deﬁnes a singular metric on KV with analytic singularities,
such that its curvature current Θh ≥ 1
m ΘA. From the construction we know that h is more
singular than hs, and Sing(h) ⊂ µ(B+(µ∗KV − D)) ∪ Sing(hs).
Remark 2.2. From Proposition 2.1 we can take Deﬁnition 2.1 as another equivalent deﬁnition
of the bigness of KV , and it is more analytic. From Theorem 1.1 we can replace the condition
that V is of general type by the bigness of KV , and it means that the deﬁnition of canonical
sheaf of singular directed varieties is very natural.

A direct consequence of Theorem 1.1 is the following corollary, which was suggested in

[GPR13]:

Corollary 2.1. Let (X, V ) be directed varieties with rank(V ) = r, and f be a holomorphic map
from Cr to (X, V ) with generic maximal rank. Then if KV is big, the image of f is contained in
Bs(V ) ( X.

The famous conjecture by Green-Griﬃths stated that in the absolute case the converse of
Theorem 1.1 should be true. It is natural to ask whether we have similar results for any directed
varieties. A result by Marco Brunella (ref. [Bru10]) gives a weak converse of Theorem 1.1 for
1-directed variety:

Theorem 2.1. Let X be a compact K¨ahler manifold equipped with a singular holomorphic
foliation F by curves. Suppose that F contains at least one leaf which is hyperbolic, then the
canonical bundle KF is pseudoeﬀective.

Indeed, Brunella proved more than the results stated in the theorem above. By putting on
KF precisely the Poincar´e metric on the hyperbolic leaves, he construct a singular hermitian
metric h (maybe not with analytic singularities) on KF , such that the set of points where
h is unbounded locally are polar set Sing(F) ∪ Parab(F), where Parab(F) are the union of
parabolic leaves, and the curvature Θh of the metric h is a positive current. Therefore, it seems
that Brunella’s theorem can be strengthened, i.e., not only KF is pseudo-eﬀective, but also the
canonical sheaf KF is pseudoeﬀective. However, as is shown in the following example, even if
all the leaves of F are hyperbolic, the canonical sheaf can not be pseudoeﬀective.
Example 2.1. A foliation by curves of degree d on the complex projective space CP n is gener-
ated by a global section

s ∈ H 0(CP n, TCP n ⊗ O(d − 1)).

From the results by Lins Neto and Soares [LS96] and Brunella [Bru06], we know that a generic
one-dimensional foliation F of degree d satisﬁes the following property:
(a) the set of the singularities Sing(F) of F is discrete;
(b) each singularity p ∈ Sing(F) is non-degenerate, i.e. the Milnor number of F at p is 1;
(c) no d + 1 points in Sing(F) lie on a projective line;
(d) all the leaves of F are hyperbolic.
Hence the Baum-Bott formula states that

#Sing(F) = cn(TCP n + O(d − 1))

nXi=0
cn−i(CP n)c1(O(d − 1))i
(cid:18)n + 1
i + 1(cid:19)(d − 1)i
nXi=0

and thus the canonical sheaf KF = O(d − 1) ⊗ ISing(F ), where ISing(F ) is the maximal ideal of
Sing(F). By property (c) above it is easy to prove that for d ≫ 0 KF is not pseudo-eﬀective.
Remark 2.3. In [McQ08] the author introduces the deﬁnition canonical singularities for fo-
liations, in dimension 2 this deﬁnition is equivalent to reduced singularities in the sense of
Seidenberg. The generic foliation by curves of degree d in CP n is another example of canonical
singularities. In this situation, one can not expect to improve the “bigness” of canonical sheaf
KF by blowing-up. Indeed, this birational model is “stable” in the sense that, π∗K eF = KF for
any birational model π : (eX, eF ) → (X,F). However, on the complex surface endowed with a
foliation F with reduced singularities, if f is an entire curve tangent to the foliation, and T [f ] is
the Ahlfors current associated with f , then in [McQ98] it is shown that the positivity of T [f ]·TF
can be improved by an inﬁnite sequence of blowing-ups, due to the fact that certain singularities
of F appearing in the blowing-ups are “small”, i.e. the lifted entire curve will not pass to these
singularities. Since T [f ] · TF is related to value distribution, and thus these small singularities
are negligible. In [Den16] this “Diophantine approximation” idea has been generalized to higher
dimensions.
