Rotated graphene bilayers form an exotic class of nanomaterials with fascinating electronic prop-
erties governed by the rotation angle θ. For large rotation angles, the electron eigenstates are
restricted to one layer and the bilayer behaves like two decoupled graphene layer. At intermediate
angles, Dirac cones are preserved but with a lower velocity and van Hove singularities are induced
at energies where the two Dirac cones intersect. At very small angles, eigenstates become localized
in peculiar zones of the Moir´e. We analyse here the eﬀect of an asymmetric doping for a series of
commensurate rotated bilayers on the basis of tight binding calculations of their band dispersions,
density of states, participation ratio and diﬀusive properties. While a small doping level preserves
the θ dependence of the rotated bilayer electronic structure, larger doping induces a further reduction
of the band velocity similarly to a further reduction of the rotation angle.

INTRODUCTION

What remains really surprising with graphene is that
all these outstanding electronic and mechanical prop-
erties come from a system that is one atomic layer
thick.1–3 Few layer graphene and more precisely bilayers
also present fascinating properties.
It has been known
for years that in this case, stacking plays a crucial role:
While AA bilayers –all C atoms are in the same position
in the two layers– result in two Dirac cones shifted in en-
ergy, AB stacking –like in graphite– breaks the atom A /
atom B symmetry and leads to a quadratic dispersion.4–8
Here we focus on exotic bilayers that present neither AA
nor AB stacking but a rotation between the two layers.

Diﬀerent approaches are used nowadays to obtain
graphene: mechanical peeling of graphite, annealing of
SiC, CVD on metals. These three approaches also give
multilayers with, in some cases, a rotation between suc-
cessive layers. Indeed rotated bilayers have been obtained
on graphite but also on Ni and on the C-face of SiC. A
rotation between two layers creates a (pseudo) periodic-
ity that appears as a moir´e pattern on STM images.9–12
All the theoretical works13–28 now agree on the fact that
two graphene layers stacked with a rotation between
them show exotic electronic properties that are angle-
dependant. The AA and AB stacking are the two ex-
treme cases, they correspond to rotations of 0o and 60o.
The bilayer behavior is symmetric with respect to a ro-
tation angle equal to 30o. At large angles (close to 30o),
the two layers are decoupled and behave like independent
graphene planes. At smaller angles, graphene Dirac cones
are conserved but the velocity is renormalized (reduced).
Van Hove singularities (vHs) are found at energies where
the Dirac cones from the two layers intersect.29–32 Even-
tually for small angles the two vHs merge at the Dirac

energy and give a sharp peak in the density of states
(DOS). The corresponding states are localized in region
of the supercell where stacking is close to AA.

Here we check the robustness of the theoretical predic-
tions with respect to doping that can be an important
perturbation. Indeed, bilayers often show an asymmet-
ric doping –one layer more doped than the other one–
whether the doping is made on purpose if a potential
bias is applied between the layers, or it results from
charge transfer with a substrate. In a tight-binding (TB)
scheme, an asymmetric doping is a shift in electrochem-
ical potential between the two layers. An asymmetric
doping opens a gap in the band structure of an AB bi-
layer. We will show that it is not the case for rotated
bilayers and that for not too small angles and reasonable
doping, linear dispersion, velocity renormalization and
vHs remain. The main eﬀect of doping is to shift one
Dirac cone with respect to the other one by an energy
amount that varies with the doping rate and the rota-
tion angle. Localization of the states either on one layer
(large angle, decoupled layers) or on both but in AA re-
gions (small angles) is not drastically change by doping.
The complex electronic structure of graphene bilayers is a
consequence of the local geometry of the system. A paral-
lel can be drawn with quasicrystals where the quasicrys-
tals properties develop when the size of the approximant
cell increases.33–35 In the same way, here speciﬁc proper-
ties arise when the commensurate cell size increases and
the AA and AB regions are better deﬁned. The parallel
is obvious when one look at transport properties and the
importance of the non Boltzmann part either for neutral
or doped bilayers.

The numerical method and atomic structures of ro-
tated bilayer are detailed in Sec. II and in the appendix,
then the eﬀect of doping on the band structure (Sec. III),

where |ii is the pz orbital with energy ǫi located at ~ri, and

matrix element, tij, between two pz orbitals located at ~ri
and ~rj is,36
tij = hi| ˆH|ji = n2
where nc is the direction cosine, Vppσ and Vppπ the Slater-
Koster coupling parameters. In our scheme,24 Vppσ and
Vppπ are exponentially decaying function of the distance.
Assymmetric doping is modelled using diﬀerent on-site
energies on the two layers. All orbitals of a layer have
the same energy. In the following, results are given as a
function of the potential bias ∆ǫ between the two layers.
∆ǫ is the diﬀerence between the on-site energies ǫ1 =
ǫ0 on the up and the on-site energies ǫ2 = ǫ0 − ∆ǫ on
the bottom layers. The coupling beyond ﬁrst neighbor
induces an asymmetry between states above and beyond
the Dirac energy in each layers. All energies are then
given with respect to the Dirac energy ED1 of the up
undoped layer (up layer) which is set to zero.

The eigenstates obtained by diagonalisation in recip-
rocal space of the TB Hamiltonian are used to calculate
transport characteristic values (velocity, square spread-
ing, diﬀusivity) as explained in the appendix A. In mono-
layer graphene (appendix A 3), transport properties are
well described by the usual semi-classical Boltzmann ap-
proach (excepted at Dirac energy), but in twisted bilayer
with small rotation angle θ, very unusual eﬀects occur at
Dirac energy that are not taken into account by Boltz-
mann approach (section VII). The average densities of
states in each layer are presented brieﬂy in section V.
They are calculated by recursion method in real space
starting from a random phases state.37 This method gives
total DOSs that are similar to the one obtained by diag-
onalisation in reciprocal space.

Our calculations require periodic systems. The way a
bilayer supercell is built and how it is labeled (n, m) is
described in Refs. [23,24]. We start from an AA bilayer
and choose the rotation origin O at an atomic site. A
commensurate structure can be deﬁned if the rotation
changes a lattice vector −−→OB (m, n) to −−→OB′ (n, m), where
the integers n, m are the coordinates with respect to
the basis vectors ~a1 (√3a/2,−a/2) and ~a2 (√3a/2, a/2),

with a = 0.2456 nm. The rotation angle is then deﬁned
as follows:

cos θ =

n2 + 4nm + m2
2(n2 + nm + m2)

and the commensurate cell vectors correspond to:

~t = −−→OB′ = n~a1 + m~a2 , ~t′ = −m~a1 + (n + m)~a2.

The commensurate unit cell contains N = 4(n2 +nm+
m2) atoms. It is now well established14,22–27 that the ro-
tation angle θ is a good parameter to describe the system

average velocity (section IV) and the density of states
(Sec. V) is discussed. The participation ratios are con-
venient quantity to characterize the states repartition as
a function of the energy.
It is shown for neutral and
doped graphene in Sec. VI. Finally speciﬁc quantum
diﬀusion due to conﬁned states in doped and undoped
twisted graphene bilayers are presented Sec. VII. For
comparison quantum diﬀusion in graphene is presented
in the appendix.

II. NUMERICAL METHODS AND ATOMIC

STRUCTURE

Tackling small rotation angles –smaller than 4o– means
handling very large cells that can involve a huge number
of atoms i.e. more than 3000. This cannot be done from
ab initio calculations and we developed a tight binding
(TB) scheme23,24 using only pz orbitals since we are inter-
ested in what happens at energies within ±2 eV of ED,
the Dirac point energy whatever the rotation angle is.
The TB scheme is described in details in Ref. 24. Since
the planes are rotated, neighbours are not on top of each
other (as it is the case in the Bernal AB stacking). In-
terlayer interactions are then not restricted to ppσ terms
but some ppπ terms have also to be introduced. The

An asymmetrically doped bilayer with a bernal stack-
ing presents a gap due to the break of all atom A / atom
B symmetry. But in twisted bilayer the situation is com-
pletely diﬀerent.50 A schematic diagram of the asymetri-
cally doped rotated bilayer is given in ﬁgure 1. It applies

because of the important state mixing between the two
layers. As a consequence of the asymetric doping, one
Dirac cone is shifted and intersection between the bands
do not occur anymore at the mid point between K1 and
K2 as it was the case in the neutral system. Then the
maximum of the band (and then the van Hove singular-
ity at E+ and E−, see Sec. V) is no more located at the
M point of the supercell Brillouin zone (Figs. 2 and 3).
No gap opens even for large doping (∆ǫ = 0.6 eV and
even more). For a given doping, the energy diﬀerence,
∆ED = ED1 − ED2, between the two Dirac points varies
with the rotation angle which results from interplan state
mixing. These energy diﬀerences are shown by arrows on
ﬁgure 3 and they are given in table II.

Whatever the rotation angle is, TB calculations show
that the bands of the shifted Dirac cone never cross the
bands of the non-shifted Dirac cone. Consequently a
limit case (and then a limit doping, corresponding to
∆ǫ = ∆ǫm) is always found when one branch of the
shifted Dirac cone approaches the parallel branch of the
second cone.
If doping is smaller than the limit dop-
ing, ∆ǫ < ∆ǫm, the energy diﬀerence ∆ED between the
Dirac cones increases with the on site energy diﬀerences
∆ǫ. The increase factor is smaller for smaller angles. If
doping is larger, ∆ǫ > ∆ǫm, ∆ED decreases when dop-
ing increases (ﬁgure 4). For each angle θ, the maximum
value can be understood in a simple scheme as follows.
For small doping –small ∆ǫ– it is obvious that

∆ED < ∆EvHs = E+ − E−.

(6)

This condition is satisﬁed for any dopping (at least
for dopping that preserves the existance of Dirac
cone). From continuum model14,25,26,29, experimental
measurements31,32 and our calculations (section V), the
energy of van Hove singularity is:

∆EvHs = ¯hvF K1K2−2tθ = 2¯hvF ΓK sin(θ/2)−2tθ (7)

compoments of the interlayer potential, tθ ≃ 0.12 eV.24,27
The calculated max value of ∆ED is drawn in the insert
of ﬁgure 4, showing that condition (6) is satisﬁed. It is

−1

interresting to remark also that for (n, m) bilayer, such as
|m− n| > 1 for instance (5,9) ﬁgure 4, when ∆ǫ increases
a mixing of bands could occur before the maximum value
of ∆E estimated by the condition (6).

For doping below the limit value, ∆ǫ ≪ ∆ǫm, slopes of
the band dispersions E(k) at Dirac point are not mod-
iﬁed (ﬁgures 2(a), 2(b) and 3(a)). But for larger ∆ǫ
values, this slopes decreases as ∆ǫ increases, which re-
sults in a strong reduction of the intra-band velocity at
Dirac points. Figure 5, shows this renormalization for
diﬀrent θ values. Above this limit (ﬁgures 2(c) and 3(b)),
∆ǫ > ∆ǫm, bands become ﬂatter and intra-band velocity
reaches a limit value ∼ 0.4Vmono (ﬁgure 5). Therefore for
large rotation angles and physicaly reasonnable doping
(∆ǫ ≪ ∆ǫm), the velocity renormalisation14,18,19,22–28 is
not modiﬁed; but for intermediate rotation angles, actual
doping can lead to strong velocity renormalisation.

B. Very small angles

The case of very small angles, typically θ < ∼ 2o, is il-
lustrated on ﬁgure 5 and ﬁgure 6 for diﬀerent doping val-
ues in (25,26) bilayer. The two Dirac cones at ED1 and
ED2 are still present and the maximum value of ∆ED is
obtained for ∆ǫm ≃ 0.25 eV (ﬁgure 6), but the behavior
of intra-band velocity at K point versus ∆ǫ diﬀers from
that for intermediate and large angles (ﬁgure 5), show-
ing that a new regim is obtained. Bands with energy E
arround Dirac energies are very ﬂat and states at these
energies are not only those of Dirac cones at K points.
Therefore the velocity of electrons at these energies is the
average of velocity of all states ~k at energy E(~k) = E as
discussed is next section.

IV. AVERAGE INTRA-BAND VELOCITY

The average intra-band velocity (Bloch-Boltzamnn ve-
locity) is calculated numerically from the velocity oper-
ator ˆVx along the x-direction and equation (A8) as ex-
plained in the appendix A. It is shown ﬁgure 7 for several
(n, m) bilayers. As expected, for large rotated angles and
small doping, this method gives velocity values that are
similar to the ones calculated directly from the slope of
bands E(~k) of Dirac cone (intra-band velocity at K shown
ﬁgure 5). For intermediate angles (ﬁgure 7(b)), the ef-
fect of the renormalisation of the intra-band velocity at
K points is seen, but this eﬀect is small because other
bands contribute also to the average velocity at same en-
ergies. For very small angles (ﬁgure 7(c)), a very small
average velocity is obtained at Dirac energy (conﬁned
states), with similar velocity value that intra-band ve-
locity of states at K points. This renormalization eﬀect
remains strong for doped bilayers but energies of local-
ized states (small velocity) are shifted. This strong re-
duction of the intra-band velocity have consequences on
electronic transport properties as shown in section VII.

V. DENSITY OF STATES

The shift of one Dirac cone in dopped bilayers induces
a modiﬁcation in the DOS as schematically shown in ﬁg-
ure 1. The van Hove singularities (vHs) are not at the M
point of the supercell brillouin zone but fall somewhere on
the K and M line. Furthermore, the DOS is constant in
between the two Dirac cones –as it is for this energy range
in a AA bilayer–. These two caracteristics are found on
the DOS of bilayers with large and intermediate angles
ﬁgures 8(a,b). For realistic doping and not too small ro-
tation angles, the variations of the vHs energies diﬀerence
∆EvHs, ∆EvHs = E+ − E−, with the rotation angle are
very similar to those of undopped bilayers (ﬁgure 8(e)),
as recently found from Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy
by V. Cherkez et al.32 For very small angles, the local-

VI. PARTICIPATION RATIO

To analyse the nature of the eigenstates in the bilayers
and search for a possible doping eﬀect, we compute the
participation ratio of each TB eigenstate |ψi deﬁned by
(8)

p(ψ) =

1

where |ii are the pz orbitals on atoms i and N is the
number of atoms in a unit cell. For completely delocal-
ized eigenstate p is equal to 1 like in graphene.
If the
state is restricted to one graphene layer, p is equal to
0.5 and a state localized on 1 atom have the smallest p
value: p = 1/N . The average participation ratio hpi as a
function of the energy E is presented on ﬁgure 10(a) for
a neutral bilayers and ﬁgure 11(a-d) for a doped ones.

N Pi |hi|ψi|4 ,

DOSs in each layer of doped bilayers are presented ﬁg-
ure 9 for intermediate and small rotation angles. As ex-
pected the global shape of DOS in doped layer is shifted
in energy by the doping. In any cases the peaks of vHs or
the peak of localization around Dirac energy are clearly
seen in the two layer DOSs at the same energies. That
suggests that corresponding states are spread in the two
layers as it is shown in next section.

The participation ratios for neutral systems clearly
illustrate the three regimes of the electronic structure
of twisted bilayers as a function of the rotation angle
through the behavior of the eigenstates.

For large angles θ –bilayers (1, 3) (θ = 32.20o) and
(5, 9) (θ = 18.73o) in ﬁgure 10(a)– hpi is equal to 0.5
which means that the eigenstate is delocalized on one of
the two layers. The layers are then decoupled in agree-
ment with the diﬀerent predictions.13–15,17–19,22–24,27

FIG. 10: TB (a) average participation ratio and (b) average
layer participation ratio in (n,m) undoped bilayers (∆ǫ = 0).

Doping does not aﬀect this result as shown Figure 11(a)
for (5, 9) bilayer.

For intermediate θ values –bilayers (6, 7) (θ = 5.08o)
ﬁgure 11(b) and (12, 13) (θ = 2.65o) ﬁgure 11(c)– the
participation ratio of a state slightly depends on the en-
ergy. It is closer to one in the energy range of the vHs
where the interaction between the two planes is stronger
and closer to 0.5 in the vicinity of the Dirac energy (inter-
action between layer is smaller for these energies). When
the bilayer is doped, the energy region where the interac-
tion between planes is weaker is just shifted accordingly.
For very small θ values, –bilayer (25, 26) (θ = 1.30o)
ﬁgures 10 and 11(d) and (33, 34) (θ = 0.99o)– states with
energy around 0 are strongly localized (small hpi values).
An analysis of spacial repartition of eigenstates, shows
that theses states are localized on the AA zones of the
Moir´e (see Ref. 23,24). For instance the participation
ratio of one eigenstate at Dirac point is p ≃ 0.12 in
(33, 34).23 The peak remains but shifted in the doped
case (ﬁgure 11(d)).

We also deﬁne a participation ratio per layer by

p∗(ψ) =

1 + P 2

where Pl, l = 1 and 2, are the weight of the eigenstate ψ

An eigenstate with non zero weight only in one layer cor-
responds to p∗ = 1/2, whereas p∗ = 1 for an eigenstate

layer participation ratio hp∗i at energy E is presented on

doped ones. For large θ angles, states exist only in one of
the two layers (hp∗i ≃ 1/2) whatever the doping is (ﬁg-
ures 10(b) and 11(a∗)). As θ decreases, hp∗i increases,
which shows that states spread more and more on the
two layers. For very small θ, states of undoped cases are
uniformly distributed on the two layers for all energies
(ﬁgure 10(b)). Figure 10(b) also shows that for inter-

mediate angles, distribution of the eigenstate on the two
layers is weaker close to the Dirac energy than for energy
in the vicinity of the vHs. For intermediated θ and very
small θ, higher doping also seems to decrease the distri-
bution on the two layers (ﬁgures 11(c∗) and 11(d∗)).

While doping does not change qualitatively the aver-
age participation ratio hpi, it signiﬁcantly decreases the
average participation ratio per layer hp∗i. Therefore an
asymmetric doping in a rotated bilayer favors a decou-
pling of the states between the layers. For very small
angles (ﬁgures 11(d) and 11(d*), θ = 1.30o), the local-
ization in AA zone is obtained in doped like in undoped
bilayer. At all energies around Dirac energy, states are
distributed on the two layers, 0.9 ≤ hp∗i ≤ 1, and the
doping reduces a little bit the equal repartition of each
eigenstate between the two layers in undoped bilayer,
hp∗i(doped) < hp∗i(undoped) ≃ 1.

VII. QUANTUM DIFFUSION IN BILAYERS

In this part we analyse the consequence on transport
properties of the “localization” mechanism17–19,23,24,51
induced by the small rotation angles. The conductivity
along x-axis is given by the Einstein formula,

σxx(EF) =

e2
S

n(EF)D(EF),

(11)

8

where n(EF) and D(EF) are the total density of
states per surface S and the average diﬀusivity at the
Fermi energy EF, respectively.
In the relaxation time
approximation,33,39,40 the eﬀect of disorder is taken into
account by a scattering time τ . In this approach τ con-
tains both elastic scattering times τe due to static defects
(adatoms, vacancies...) and inelastic scattering time τi
due to phonons or magnetic ﬁeld (...): τ −1 = τ −1
. τ
deceases when the temperature T increases and when the
concentration of static defects increases. As explained in
the appendix A, the diﬀusivity D can by determined at
every energy E as function of the scattering time τ . D is
the sum of two terms,

e +τ −1

i

D(EF, τ ) = DB(τ ) + DNB(EF, τ ),

(12)

where DB(EF, τ ) = V 2
Bτ /3 is the Boltzmann term and
DNB the non-Boltzmann term. DNB comes from non-
diagonal terms in the velocity operator (equation (A7)
in the appendix). In crystals it is related to inter-band
transitions activated by elastic or inelastic scattering. For
large τ , DNB decreases when τ increases, and DNB → 0
when τ → +∞. Thus in crystals, D ≃ DB when τ →
+∞.
Diﬀusivity calculated for graphene and several bilay-
ers is presented ﬁgure 12 for diﬀerent EF values and for
doped or undoped bilayers. For graphene and bilayers
with large and intermediate rotation angles, D ≃ DB at
every energy. The only eﬀect of non-Boltzmann term is a
change in the slope of D(τ ) at scattering time τ ≃ ¯h/E as
explained in appendix A. Eventually at small scattering
time, τ ≪ ¯h/E, the inter-band transition between the
two bands of each Dirac cone contribute signiﬁcantly. In
case of graphene, with a ﬁrst neighbor coupling hamil-
tinian, the non-Boltzmann term DNB is equal to Boltz-
mann term DB and then D = 2DB for τ ≪ ¯h/E (see
equations (A14) and (A15) in appendix A 3). This eﬀect
is related with the phenomenon of jittery motion also
called Zitterbewegung3 which is important in the optical
conductivity. In graphene and bilayers with large rotated
angles it occurs for too small scattering time values to be
signiﬁcant experimentally. But in rotated bilayers with
very small rotation angle θ, for states at energy where ve-
locity is very small (i.e. energies close to Dirac energy),
the Boltzmann term in equation (12) goes down and non-
Boltzmann term becomes signiﬁcant in the total diﬀusiv-
ity. For instance ﬁgure 12(a) shows that for (25,26) bi-
layers (θ = 1.3o) at EF = 0, D is strongly aﬀected by the
non-Boltzmann term for realistic41 τ values. It results in
a smaller diﬀusivity with respect to graphene case, that
is almost independant on scattering time for τ ≃ 10−14
– 10−13s.
In asymmetric doped bilayer (ﬁgures 12(d)
and 12(c)) similar eﬀect occurs at energies with small
Boltzmann velocity (ﬁgure 7). This regime, called small
velocity regime, where non-Boltzamnn terms dominate
transport properties has already been observed in sys-
tems with complex atomic structure such as quasicrystals
and complex metallic alloys (see Refs 33–35,48,49 and
Refs in there). Roughly speaking small velocity regime is

9

reached when mean free path l = V τ of charge carriers is
smaller than spacial extension Lwp of the corresponding
wave packet. In that case semi-classical approximation
breaks down and a pure quantum description is necessary
to calculated transport properties. Twisted bilayer with
very small rotation angle have a huge unit cell and a huge
cell of the Moir´e, in which states at E ≃ ED are conﬁned
in AA zone24 and have then a very small velocity (ﬁgure
7). Typically the size of AA zone is ∼ 0.5P , where P
is the moir´e period (equation (5)), and then the exten-
sion of conﬁned states in AA zone is Lwp <
∼ 0.5P . As P
increases when θ increases, the condition V τ < Lwp of
the small velocity regime should be satisﬁed for θ small
enough.

In doped and undoped twisted bilayers, for energy that
does not correspond to peak of localization in the DOS,
the Boltzmann velocity is larger, and the non-Boltzamnn
eﬀect is neglectable (ﬁgure 12(b)).

culations, show that the Bloch-Boltzmann model breaks
down and strong interference quantum eﬀects dominate
transport properties.

VIII. CONCLUSION

1. Average square spreading in perfect crystal at

zero temperature

To summarize, numerical calculations show that doped
rotated layers with large rotation angle and reason-
able doping (inducing a shift of the Dirac point smaller
than 0.8 eV) still behave like decoupled layers as found
experimentally.32 This result is of particular importance
for epitaxial graphene on the C face of SiC, at least for
large rotation angles. In this case, the C plane closest
to the interface dominates the transport because it is
doped due to charge transfer from the interface. This
charge transfer corresponds to a shift of the Dirac point
of 0.2 − 0.3 eV above the Fermi level. Experiments and
theory42 showed that it is decoupled from the substrate
and thanks to a large rotation angle stacking, it can also
be decoupled from the other C planes. Here we show that
actual asymmetric doping do not alter the layer decou-
pling so that this plane can exhibit isolated graphene like
properties even if it is sandwiched between the interface
and other C layers as observed experimentally.43,44

Thanks to the tight binding scheme, we have been able
to address the important question of the eﬀect of dop-
ing on rotated graphene bilayers with intermediate angle
values corresponding to large cells of Moir´e. For a small
symmetric doping, twisted layers with large and inter-
mediate rotation angles keep their characteristics: linear
band dispersions, renormalized band velocity at Dirac
point (K point) and van Hove singularities, as expected
experimentally.32 But a large enough doping increases
the renormalization of the velocity. For large angles, this
new eﬀect occurs for unphysical doping values, but for in-
termediated angles, it occurs for accessible doping values,
typically when ∆ǫ = few 0.1 eV.

For very small angles, electronic states remain conﬁned
in the AA region of the Moir´e whatever the doping is, as
in undoped bilayers.23,24 Therefore, the regime of con-
ﬁnement by very large cells of the Moir´e is not destroyed
by the doping, but localization energies are shifted with

In the framework of Kubo-Greenwood approach for
calculation of the conductivity, a central quantity is the
average quadratic spreading of wave packets of energy E
at time t along the x direction,33,34,39,40

sition operator ˆX. h ˆAiE means an average of diagonal
elements of the operator ˆA over all states with energy E.

In pure crystals at zero temperature, once the band
structure is calculated from the tight-binding Hamilto-
nian the average quadratic spreading can be computed
exactly in the basis of Bloch states.33,39 The average
square spreading is the sum of two terms:33,39

The ﬁrst term is the ballistic (intra-band) contribution at
the energy E. VB is the Boltzmann velocity in the x di-
rection. The semi-classical theory is equivalent to taking
into account only this ﬁrst term. The second term (inter-
band contributions), ∆X 2
NB(E, t), is a non-ballistic (non-
Boltzmann) contribution. It is due to the non-diagonal

RTA has been used successfully to compute33
conductivity in approximants of quasicrystals where
quantum diﬀusion and localization eﬀect play a
role33–35,45,46 and conductivity in organic
essential
semiconductors.47 In this paper we show that quantum
interferences have a also strong eﬀect in transport prop-
erties of rotated bilayers with very small angles.

The eﬀect of static disorder and/or decoherence mech-
anisms such as electron-electron scattering, electron
phonon interaction (temperature), is not considered in
the above section. This eﬀect can be treated in a phe-
nomenological way by introducing an inelastic scattering
time τ in the relaxation time approximation (RTA).33 τ
may include elastic scattering time τe (due to static de-
fects like vacancies or adatoms) and inelastic scattering
time τi (due to phonon, electron-electron scattering, ef-
fect of magnetic ﬁeld): τ −1 = τ −1
. τ decreases
when the temperature increases and/or static defects in-
creases. In actual graphene at room temperature, realis-
tic values of τi are a few 10−13 s.41 The conductivity can
then be estimated by:

Dirac distribution function is taken equal to its zero tem-
perature value. This is valid provided that the electronic
properties vary smoothly on the thermal energy scale

where γ0 is the coupling term between ﬁrst neighbor pz
orbitals. At small time t, t ≪ ¯h/E, the Non-Boltzmann
term is equal
NB(E, t) ≃
V 2
B t2, thus ∆X 2(E, t) ≃ 2V 2
B t2 and D(E, t) ≃ 2V 2
B t.
Whereas for large t, the Boltzmann term dominates
B t2 and D(E, t) ≃ V 2
and ∆X 2(E, t) ≃ V 2
B t. The non-
Boltzmann term is due to matrix elements of the ve-
locity operator between the two bands (i.e.
inter-band
coupling between the hole and electron states having the
same wavevector). These matrix elements imply that
the velocity correlation function has also two parts: one
constant and the other oscillating at a frequency 2E/¯h
where E is the energy of the state. This is precisely

the phenomenon of jittery motion also called Zitterbewe-
gung. Note that in any crystal having several bands there
are also components of the velocity correlation function
which are oscillating at frequencies (E~k,n − E~k,n′ )/¯h.
Therefore Zitterbewegung is quite common in condensed
matter physics. For example approximants of quasicrys-
tals present very strong Zitterbewegung eﬀect and the
non-Boltzmann contribution dominates the Boltzmann
contribution.33,35,48,49

With defects (static defects or phonons...) in RTA, the
diﬀusivity D(EF, τ ) is also the sum of a Boltzmann term,

DB(τ ) =

For small scattering time, τ ≪ ¯h/E, the non-Boltzmann
term DNB is equal to Boltzmann term DB and D = 2DB.
For large τ , τ ≫ ¯h/E, DNB → 0 and D = DB. When
EF = 0 (i.e. Dirac energy), the non-Boltzmann term
equals the Boltzmann term for all scattering times. On
ﬁgures 12(a) and 12(b) this modiﬁcation of D(τ ) at
τ = ¯h/E is clearly seen. But this limit case should be
very diﬃcult to obtain experimentally. Similar results is
obtained for twisted bilayers with large angle of rotation
θ, whereas for small θ this modiﬁcation becomes larger
showing that non Boltzmann term are not neglectable
anymore.
