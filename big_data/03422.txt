Motivated by recent experiments, we address an ambiguity between the intrinsic in-plane spin
projection of 2-dimensional surface states on 3-dimensional topological insulators and their ensem-
ble spin polarization induced by a non-equilibrium charge current. Standard expressions from a
Boltzmann equation approach in the relaxation-time approximation at zero and ﬁnite temperature
are used to emphasize our assertion that despite high in-plane spin projection, obtainable current-
induced ensemble spin polarization is minuscule. The only exception is in the limit when chemical
potential approaches the charge neutrality Dirac point, when the carrier density itself simultaneously
vanishes.

The prospect of electrically generating spin-polarized
charge carriers without the use of ferromagnetic met-
als has intrigued the spintronics community for sev-
eral years.[1] Possible schemes to achieve this end
include spin-Hall eﬀect[2] and current-induced spin
polarization[3, 4] in materials with strong spin-orbit cou-
pling.

The recent discovery of topological insulators (TIs)
has fueled interest in attempts to meet this challenge.
In these TI materials, spin-orbit interaction is so strong
that it leads to an inverted bandgap, necessitating the
existence of gapless 2-dimensional states at the isolated
surface of a three-dimensional bulk. As shown in Fig. 1,
these states have a linear dispersion E = ±kvF near the
degeneracy (or ‘Dirac’) point and ideally have a helical
spin orientation (cid:126)k × ˆz. This rigid relationship between (cid:126)k
and spin is often dubbed “spin-momentum locking”.

At equilibrium, the opposite group velocities for anti-
parallel spins in this simple model has been said to re-
sult in a perfectly-polarized (and “dissipationless”) “spin
current”.[5] However, the relevance of this putative spin
current to the goals of realizing useful devices is question-
able at best, since it is no more physical than the equally
“dissipationless” surface charge current on a magnetized
solid.[6] Neither can be coupled to other materials to do
useful work.

In addition to this useless surface spin current po-
larization, deviations from the ideal in-plane spin ori-
entation result from out-of-plane contributions to the
eﬀective spin-orbit ﬁelds, lowering their intrinsic state
“polarization”.[7] For example, threefold rotational sym-
metry in Bi2Se3 leads to a hexagonal warping[8] due to a
spin-orbit coupling similar to Dresselhaus spin splitting
in some 2-dimensional semiconductors with the same ro-
tational symmetry.[9]

Either of these spin “polarizations” can easily be con-
fused with the density spin polarization that accompanies
momentum asymmetry, induced by driving a real charge
current through the occupied surface states.[10, 11] Un-
like the surface spin current, this spin polarization may
conceivably be coupled to an external material for spin-
tronic purposes.[12]

FIG. 1. Spin-polarized dispersion of the gapless surface states
in a generic three-dimensional topological insulator, showing
out-of-equilibrium occupied states at zero temperature in an
electric ﬁeld along x. Outer surface shading in red is propor-
tional to spin-up component, inner shading in blue is propor-
tional to spin-down in a y-axis spin basis. The equilibrium
Fermi surface is shown as a dashed circle parallel to the kx−ky
plane, with ideal spin orientation shown in green arrows.

The possibility of using the current-induced spin polar-
ization in the surface states has motivated many recent
experiments. By measuring the open-circuit voltage on
a ferromagnetic contact[13], claims of surface state spin
polarizations in the range 20-40% have been made.[14–
17] If this is indeed an ensemble spin density polarization
induced by the ﬂow of current (whether from surface or
bulk states), these values would establish TIs as a viable
means for producing spin-polarized electrons without fer-
romagnetic elements, so long as the power dissipation
from the necessary current ﬂow is tolerated.[18]

Which spin polarization has been measured (if at all)?
The current-induced spin polarization (a property of the
nonequilibrium ensemble) or the intrinsic spin in-plane
spin projection of the states themselves?[7, 8] Due to the
accumulation of similar experiments reported in the lit-
erature, and prevalence of ambiguous spin polarization
claims associated with this method, we ﬁnd it essential
to examine a realistic and well-supported model. The
purpose of the present manuscript is therefore to provide

induced spin polarization in topological surface states,
and to show that even if the in-plane spin projection (the
intrinsic spin “polarization”) is of the order of unity, the
maximal ensemble spin polarization is minuscule.
Total current– A charge current density j induced
by an electric ﬁeld Ex distorts the zero-temperature oc-
cupation function f ((cid:126)k) = f0((cid:126)k) + g((cid:126)k) out of equi-
librium, where f0((cid:126)k) is the spherically-symmetric zero-
temperature Fermi-Dirac distribution. Here, the asym-
metric component g((cid:126)k) = ∆kx

determined by algebraic solution of the linear Boltzmann
equation) is responsible for the nonzero current density
j, where τ is the momentum scattering time. We can
calculate it via

Spin density– As schematically shown by red and blue
shading in Fig. 1, the spin wavefunction of a given TI
surface state in the y-basis, assuming the simplest two-
band model with 100% in-plane spin polarization, is

Already from Eqn. 2 we can see that Bi2Se3 is par-
ticularly disadvantaged for generating current-induced
spin polarization.
Even if electron-(acoustic)phonon
coupling is weak, strong coupling to an 8meV optical
phonon[19] will
limit ∆kx so with a metallic sample
having Fermi energy in the conduction band the up-
per limit for spin polarization (at the threshold of ther-
mal avalanche under extremely high current density) is

(cid:62) ∆E/Eg=8meV/300meV ≈ 3% .

Open circuit voltage– Transport experiments purport-
ing to measure the surface state spin polarization ulti-
mately must relate it to the open-circuit voltage of a fer-
romagnetic metal (FM) in contact with the TI across
a tunnel barrier. This voltage is present to maintain
zero net current through the interface, subject to a (cid:126)k-
dependent conductivity σI = σ↑ cos2 θ

where Pf b = σ↑−σ↓

Note that the quantity in parenthesis evF kF
has
units of a fundamental charge current unrelated to the
surface current density j. Here, we have assumed per-
fect spin polarization of the surface states themselves
states with opposite (cid:126)k can be expressed as spin
(i.e.
up and down); accounting for deviations from this con-
dition, as when considering a model with more than just
two bands,[7, 8] involves inclusion of an intrinsic surface
state spin polarization factor PSS in Eqn. 6. This quan-
tity is a measure of the in-plane spin projection of states
near the chemical potential.

Other than an errant factor of π and approximation of
Pf b with PF M , our result Eqn. 6 is consistent with the
ﬁrst equation of Ref. 21, which is often used in the anal-
ysis of open-circuit voltage spin detection experiments
on TIs. In that paper, the authors assert an expression
equivalent to

[Ref. 21, Eqn. 1]

(7)

where we simply use our variable deﬁnitions and j =
I/W , where I is total charge current and W is the width

of the FM/TI interface transverse to the current ﬂow.
This equation is also consistent up to a factor of 2 with
the expression given in Ref. 22.

The surface state polarization PSS extracted from
measurements of ∆V in this way have values of 0.2-
0.4.[14–17] However, one must remember that this is
not the current-induced spin polarization PCI given in
Eqn.
3, which is typically two orders of magnitude
smaller. By no means has the viability of “. . . using TIs
as spin polarized sources for spintronic devices at am-
bient temperatures”[15] been established, unless there is
an eﬃcient momentum-ﬁltering mechanism as in angle-
resolved photo-emission spectroscopy (ARPES) measure-
ments.

Finite Temperature– Our zero temperature model is
limited to the linear response regime where we expect
ohmic transport. Eqn. 3 is still correct at ﬁnite tem-
perature T , but the current density (Eqn. 1) and the
current-induced spin polarization (Eqn. 2) are modiﬁed
by the necessity to integrate over the gradient of Fermi-
Dirac distribution f , yielding a quantity

The appropriate zero-temperature expressions are clearly
recovered in the βF → ∞ limit. Furthermore, at non-
zero temperatures the current-induced spin polarization
is slightly enhanced:
for βF = 1, PCI from Eqn. 9
is ≈30% larger than the zero-temperature result (Eqn.
2) at the same value of ∆kx. Note that this may re-
quire substantial increase in the electric ﬁeld Ex since
the relaxation time τ is likely to be shortened by ad-
ditional electron-phonon scattering. At room temper-
ature, kBT ≈30meV and the deviation from the zero-
temperature result is negligible in Bi2Se3 with typi-
cal F ≈ 300meV, as can be seen from expansion of
x ln(1 + ex) ≈ 1 + e−x/x in the limit of large x.
Discussion and Conclusion– With a chemical poten-
tial F = vF kF = 100 meV and vF ≈ 108 cm/s[23],
Eqn. 3 gives j0 ≈ 3 A/cm. Therefore, to drive a current-
induced spin polarization of ≈1%, one must source a
2D current density of ≈ 3µA/µm. With a mobility of
µ =1000 cm2/Vs[19] and charge density of 1013cm−2, the
TI has resistivity ρ = (nqµ)−1 ≈1 kΩ(cid:50). The Joule power
is then j2ρ ≈1W/cm2 for 1% polarization. Likewise, 10%
polarization demands ≈100W/cm2 (roughly the same as
dissipation in modern CMOS logic!). The bulk gap in
many TIs is only several hundred meV or less, and hence

they likely cannot be used in this regime without an in-
tolerably high contribution from bulk conduction due to
local heating and interband thermal excitation.

We have established that the obtainable current-
induced spin polarization in 2-dimensional surface states
are in general much smaller than the static spin polar-
ization of conduction electrons in a typical metallic fer-
romagnet. This ignores the further possibility that the
measured open-circuit voltage signal is polluted by spuri-
ous eﬀects and its physical interpretation may in fact be
ambiguous to begin with.[22] The only apparent way to
circumvent this essential limitation is to approach the
charge-neutrality condition when chemical potential is
close to the Dirac point. However, the total charge den-
sity is then simultaneously minimized, so that the TI
surface can not provide many carriers regardless of their
spin polarization. Ultimately, one struggles to justify the
cost of high collateral power dissipation in a quest to gen-
erate a meager spin polarization.
