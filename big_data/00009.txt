Abstract

The Fine Pixel CCD (FPCCD) is one of the candidate sensor technolo-
gies for the ILC vertex detector. It will be located near interaction point
and require high radiation tolerance. It will thus be operated at -40◦C
to improve radiation tolerance. In this paper, we report on the status of
neutron radiation tests, on a cooling system using two-phase CO2 with
a gas compressor for circulation, and on the mechanical structure of the
FPCCD ladders.

1 Introduction

The main role of a vertex detector in ILC is to identify b-quark and c-quark
from light quarks and gluones. In general, a b-jet has 2 vertices and c-jet has
3 vertices, while light quarks and gluones have 1 vertex. A vertex detector uses
that information to identify quarks. Since lifetime of b-quark and c-quark is
very short with about 1 pico second, the requirement for the impact parameter
resolution is 5 ⊕ 10/(pβ sin3/2 θ) (µm) [1]. The innermost layer is located at
radius of 1.6cm from the beamline for good impact parameter resolution, thus
it is exposed to many e+e− backgrounds from beam-beam interaction. Hit
occupancy less than a few % is necessary for track reconstruction but it would
be about 10 % using a vertex detector which has normal pixel size 25 × 25(µm)
when it accumulates all the hits from one beam train.
There are two solutions to get a low pixel occupancy. One is to read out
many times in one beam train. Its problem is a EMI noise from beam. Another
is to use a small pixel size as 5 × 5(µm) and to read out during the train gap.

1

In this way, there are no EMI noise. The Fine Pixel CCD (FPCCD) vertex
detector adopts the second way [2].

2 Neutron irradiation test

CCD is generally sensitive to radiation damage especially from heavy particles.
Since neutrons would come from beam dump in ILC, neutron tolerance should
be checked. A neutron irradiation test was performed at CYRIC of Tohoku
University from 15th to 17th Oct. 2014. The energy of neutron beam produced
by 70 MeV proton beam through a reaction of Li + p→Be + n is about 65 MeV.
An FPCCD prototype whose pixel size is 6 × 6(µm) was irradiated 2 hours
and its ﬂuence was 1.78 × 1010(neq/cm2). In ILC experiment neutron ﬂuence is
estimated at 1.85 × 109(neq/cm2/year) [3] thus the neutron ﬂuence coresponds
to 19 years of √s = 500GeV ILC beam time shared by two detectors. After
the irradiation, the FPCCD prototype was kept at room temperature to see its
anealing eﬀect.

3 Measurement of performance

We have studied three parameters to measure the radiation tolerance of the
FPCCD. They are average dark charge of all pixels, hot pixel fraction and
charge transfer ineﬃciency. These parameters are measured 3, 9, 23 and 199
days after irradiation to see annealing eﬀect. Status of these studies are reported
in the following [4].

3.1 Dark charge

The FPCCD detects signal as electrons. However, electorns which come from
thermal excitation are detected as dark charge even if there are no signal. There-
fore dark charge is accumulated proportional to exposure time of CCD. Dark
charge is measured with exposure time 5, 10, 30 and 60 second at -30 ◦C and
-40 ◦C. Before the irradiation, dark charge is almost gaussian, but after the
irradiation it has a tail. Thus dark charge is measured using two methods. One
is the peak position and another is the mean. The peak position is deﬁned
by the gaussian component and the mean includes tail eﬀect. Dark charge is
proportional to exposure time thus it is ﬁtted with linear function and its slope
is dark current(Fig.1). Dark charge in 200ms, which is time of train gap, is
estimated from dark current. Before the irradiation, both indicators, the peak
position and the mean, are almost zero. After the irradiation, the dark charge is
larger still much smaller than signal charge. Nevertheless, it is enough smaller
than signal charge. Annealing eﬀect of the peak position is not seen. For the
mean, however, a small annealing eﬀect is seen(Fig.2). That indicates tail due
to the irradiatioin became smaller.

tion of elapsed day plus 1 day in lo-
galithmic scale are show. Neutron
beam was irradiated on 1st day.

3.2 Hot pixel fraction

There are two kind of hot pixel. One is a hot pixel whose dark charge is always
higher than 3 sigma of dark charge. Another is a hot pixel whose dark charge is
usually small but sometimes large because of random telegraph noise [5]. Before
the irrdiation ADC distribution of dark charge were ﬁtted with gaussian and the
mean (µ) and the width (σ) were obtained. We measured dark charge in each
pixel many times after the irradiation at -30 ◦C and -40◦C. When ADC value
scaled to 200 msec exposure time is larger than µ + 3σ with probability of more
than 80%, we deﬁned it as a hot pixel. Before the irradiation, Hot pixel fraction
was 0 but after the irradiation it became 2.76 × 10−5 at -40 ◦C which is much
smaller than background occupancy of 2.8% and requirement of a few percent.
Annealing eﬀect is seen and it is consistent with annealing eﬀect of dark charge
(Fig.3). The tail of dark charge comes from hot pixels and hot pixels decreased
due to annealing thus tail also decreased.

3.3 Charge transfer inneﬃciency

CCD transfers signal charge from pixel to pixel to be read out in the end.
Ideally charge is transferred completely however charge is actually lost by lattice
defect. The main source of lattice defects is radiation damage. Charge transfer
ineﬃciency (CTI) is introduced as an indicator of the charge loss. We diﬁned
CTI as ineﬃciency of one transfer from pixel to pixel. Irradiation by 5.9 keV
X-ray from Fe55 is used to measure CTI. Peak position of Fe55 signal in each
pixel is ﬁtted with a function of f (x, y) = S(1 − CT Ih)x(1 − CT Iv)y where S
is peak position of X-ray from Fe55 before the transfers then CTI is obtained
(Fig.4). Signals are transferred horizontally and vertically, and CTI is deﬁned
for each case: CT Ih and CT Iv.
In this study we used super pixels each of
which consists of 16 × 16 pixels instead of pixels because of low statics of X-ray.

Figure 3: Annealing eﬀect of hot pixel fraction [4]. Hot pixel fraction as a
function of elapsed day plus 1 day in logalithmic scale are shown. Neutron
beam was irradiated on 1st day.

The CTI’s after the irradiation were found as follows: CT Ih = 3.49 × 10−5 and
CT Iv = 6.34 × 10−5. A real size of FPCCD will be 13000 × 128 pixels for one
readout thus maximum charge loss is (1 − 3.49 × 10−5)13000(1 − 6.34 × 10−5) =
0.63. Annealing eﬀect was not seen (Fig.5).

4 Ladder R&D

Ladder design idea for the FPCCD is shown in Fig.6. It has dobble-sided ladder
structure and their space is about 2mm. Two FPCCD chips are attached on
both sides and two readout ASICs are on both ends. Ladder structure which is
made by Si, Kapton FPC and CFRP, is shown in Fig.7.

Silicon wafer is found bending because of thickness which is 50 µm thus
gluing by vacuum suction is needed for assembly. Additionally, there are thermal
issue. FPCCD will be operated at -40 ◦C. Diﬀerence of coeﬃcients of thermal
expansion between Si and CFRP is an issue. This stress has to be absorbed by
soft glue. R&D has just begun.

5 Two-phase CO2 cooling system

FPCCD will be operated at -40 ◦C to improve radiation tolerance. However,
space for cooling pipe and thermal insulator inside ILD is very limited. two-
phase CO2 cooling system uses the heat of vaporization to cool detectors which
can cool detectors suﬃciently thanks to the large latent heat of CO2 (300 J/g)
in spite of the limited space. Therefore two-phase CO2 is the most suitable
choice. There are two options of CO2 cooling. One is a circulation using liquid
pump and another is a circulation using a gas compressor. The latter is our
R&D choice [6].

In this cooling plant, CO2 is circulated near room temperature and cooled
by the heat exchanger on the detector side (Fig.8). Thus a low temperature (

cooling plant and the detector are not necessary. Cooling water supplied for the
ILC experimental hall will be used for CO2 condensation instead of a chiller. A
demerit of this system is need of heater to conpletely vaporize CO2 returning
to gas conpressor.

We have demonstrated the cooling between -40 ◦C to +15 ◦C with a proto-

type cooling system using a gas compressor.

6 Summary

The status of the R&D studies on the FPCCD vertex detector for the ILC is
reported. The neutron irradiation test was performed at CYRIC. An FPCCD
sensor was irradiated by neutron of 1.78 × 1010(neq/cm2) in two hours, which
corresponds to 19 years of ILC running at √s = 500GeV. Dark current and
hot pixel fraction get larger after the irradiation; the increase, however, is small
enough to be problematic. CTI is also increased but it is acceptable level, as
far as neutron background is concerned.

Ladder design and assembly ideas are suggested. R&D has just begun. Two-
phase CO2 cooling system using gas compressor is found to be the most suitable
choice for FPCCD. A prototype demonstrated suﬃcient cooling between -40 ◦C
to +15 ◦C.
