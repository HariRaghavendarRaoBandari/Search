ABSTRACT

Context. The future space missions Euclid and WFIRST-AFTA will use the Hα emission line to measure the redshifts of tens of
millions of galaxies. The Hα luminosity function at z > 0.7 is one of the major sources of uncertainty in forecasting cosmological
constraints from these missions.
Aims. We construct uniﬁed empirical models of the Hα luminosity function spanning the range of redshifts and line luminosities
relevant to the redshift surveys proposed with Euclidand WFIRST-AFTA.
Methods. By ﬁtting to observed luminosity functions from Hα surveys, we build three models for its evolution. Diﬀerent ﬁtting
methodologies, functional forms for the luminosity function, subsets of the empirical input data, and treatment of systematic errors
are considered to explore the robustness of the results.
Results. Functional forms and model parameters are provided for all three models, along with the counts and redshift distributions up
to z ∼ 2.5 for a range of limiting ﬂuxes (FHα > 0.5 − 3 × 10−16 erg cm−2 s−1) that are relevant for future space missions. For instance,
in the redshift range 0.90 < z < 1.8, our models predict an available galaxy density in the range 7700–13300 and 2000–4800 deg−2
respectively at ﬂuxes above FHα > 1 and 2× 10−16 erg cm−2 s−1, and 32000–48000 for FHα > 0.5× 10−16 erg cm−2 s−1 in the extended
redshift range 0.40 < z < 1.8. We also consider the implications of our empirical models for the total Hα luminosity density of the
Universe, and the closely related cosmic star formation history.

1. Introduction

Since the discovery of the apparent acceleration of the expan-
sion of the Universe (e.g. Riess et al. 1998; Perlmutter et al.
1999), many eﬀorts have been made to measure the dark en-
ergy equation of state, exploiting diﬀerent observations. Among
the suggestions proposed, the use of baryon acoustic oscilla-
tions (BAO) as standard rulers appears to have a particularly
low level of systematic uncertainty since it corresponds to a fea-
ture in the correlation function, whereas most observational and
astrophysical systematics are expected to be broad-band (e.g.
Albrecht et al. 2006). Indeed, in recent years, the BAO technique
has seen a dramatic improvement in capability owing to the in-
crease in volume probed by galaxy surveys (e.g. Cole et al. 2005;
Eisenstein et al. 2005; Percival et al. 2007, 2010; Blake et al.
2011a,b; Padmanabhan et al. 2012; Xu et al. 2012; Kazin et al.
2013; Anderson et al. 2014; Kazin et al. 2014).

The future space-based galaxy redshift surveys planned
for the ESA’s Euclid (Laureijs et al. 2011) and NASA’s Wide-
Field Infrared Survey Telescope - Astrophysics Focused Tele-
scope Assets design (WFIRST-AFTA) (Spergel et al. 2015;
Green et al. 2012) missions will use near-IR (NIR) slitless spec-
troscopy to collect large samples of emission-line galaxies to
probe dark energy. These spectroscopic surveys will identify

mainly Hα emitters out as far as z ∼ 2, and their maps of large-
scale structure will be used for studies of BAO, power spectrum
P(k) in general, large-scale structure, as well as other statistics
such as the measurement of the rate of growth of structure us-
ing redshift space distortions (Kaiser 1987; Guzzo et al. 2008).
In this context the space density of Hα emitters (i.e. their lumi-
nosity function) is a key ingredient for a mission’s performance
forecast to determine the number of objects above the mission’s
sensitivity threshold and optimize the survey.

It is known that the cosmic star formation rate was higher
in the Universe’s past than it is today, possibly peaking near
z ∼ 2 (Madau & Dickinson 2014), thereby ensuring a high num-
ber of star-forming objects with high luminosity at high red-
shift suitable for BAO measurements. However, the abundance
of Hα emitters detectable by blind spectroscopy has historically
been ﬁrmly established only at low redshift by means of spec-
troscopic surveys in the optical (e.g. Gallego et al. 1995). At
higher redshift, from the ground, the intense airglow makes NIR
spectroscopic searches for emission line galaxies impractical;
thus systematic ground-based NIR Hα spectroscopic searches
in early studies have been limited to small areas with single
slit spectroscopy (e.g. Tresse et al. 2002). Therefore, narrow-
band NIR searches have been used as an alternative method for

identifying large numbers of z > 0.7 emission-line galaxies,
e.g. HiZELS (Geach et al. 2008; Sobral et al. 2009, 2012, 2013)
and the NEWFIRM Hα Survey (Ly et al. 2011). These surveys
have the advantage of wide area and high sensitivity to emis-
sion lines but suﬀer from their narrow redshift ranges and sig-
niﬁcant contamination from emission lines at diﬀerent redshifts.
From space, grism spectroscopy with NICMOS (Yan et al. 1999;
Shim et al. 2009) and more recently with the Wide Field Camera
3 (WFC3) on the HubbleSpaceTelescope, have allowed small-
area surveys, such as the WFC3 Infrared Spectroscopic Parallels
(WISP) survey (Colbert et al. 2013), at relevant ﬂuxes (deeper
than Euclidor WFIRST-AFTA) to probe the luminosity function
of emission line objects at high redshift.

As a result, early studies of space-based galaxy redshift sur-
veys often based their Hα luminosity function models on indirect
extrapolations from alternative star formation indicators such as
the rest-frame ultraviolet continuum or [O ii] line strength (e.g.
Ly et al. 2007; Takahashi et al. 2007; Reddy et al. 2008). While
physically motivated, this procedure suﬀers from a multitude of
uncertainties in the details of the H ii region parameters, dust ex-
tinction, stellar populations, and the joint distribution thereof,
and the impact of uncertainties in the predicted Hα ﬂux is en-
hanced by the steepness of the luminosity function.

Motivated by the prospect of future dark energy surveys tar-
geting Hα emitters at near-infrared wavelengths (i.e. z > 0.5),
Geach et al. (2010) used the empirical data available at that time
to model the evolution of the Hα luminosity function out to
z ∼ 2. Much more ground- and space-based data have become
available since then, thanks largely to the same improvements in
NIR detector technology that make Euclid and WFIRST-AFTA
possible. In particular, the WFC3 Infrared Spectroscopic Paral-
lels (WISP) survey (Colbert et al. 2013) has enabled the blind
detection of large numbers of Hα emitters. Due to its similar-
ity to the observational setups planned for Euclidand WFIRST-
AFTA, it is an excellent test case against which to calibrate ex-
pectations for these future missions.

In this work, we update the empirical model of Geach et al.
(2010), collecting a larger dataset of Hα luminosity functions
from low- to high-redshift, in order to constrain the evolution of
the space density of Hα emitters. We construct three empirical
models and make prediction for future Hα surveys as a func-
tion of sensitivity threshold (i.e. counts) and redshift (i.e. redshift
distributions). We scale all the luminosity functions to a refer-
ence cosmology with H0 = 70 km s−1 Mpc−1 and Ωm = 0.3,
and present results in terms of comoving volume. The models
and luminosity functions presented here are for Hα only, not
Hα+[N ii]. The ﬁnal aim of these models is to provide key in-
puts for instrumental simulations essential to derive forecast in
future space missions, like Euclid and WFIRST-AFTA, that at
the nominal resolution will be partially able to resolve Hα. Fu-
ture simulations will clarify all the observational eﬀects, from
source confusion to the [N ii] contamination and percentiles of
blended lines, completeness and selection eﬀects.

We emphasize here that our models are empirical and there-
fore we have reduced as much as possible any astrophysics as-
sumption, but those based on Hα public data. Furthermore, we
do not attempt to exclude the AGN contribution from the bright
end of the Hα public luminosity functions, being AGNs valid
sources (as Hα emitters) for the current planned missions. Thus
they should not be excluded to derive the total number of Hα
emitters mapped by Euclidand WFIRST-AFTA.

This paper is organized as follows. The input data is de-
scribed in §2. The three models and the procedures used to derive
them are described in §3, and the comparison to the input data

Article number, page 2 of 16

is summarized in §4. §5 describes the redshift and ﬂux distribu-
tion, with a focus on the ranges relevant to Euclidand WFIRST-
AFTA, and §6 compares our results to semi-analytic mock cata-
logues. Our Hα luminosity functions are compared to other es-
timates of the cosmic star formation history in §7. We conclude
in §8. Technical details are placed in the appendices.

2. Empirical luminosity functions

Forecasts for future NIR slitless galaxy redshift surveys require
as input the luminosity function of Hα emitters (HαLF) in or-
der to determine the number of objects above the mission’s sen-
sitivity threshold. In particular, we focus on the prediction for
the originally planned EuclidWide grism survey (Laureijs et al.
2011), i.e to a ﬂux limit FHα > 3 × 10−16 erg cm−2 s−1, and de-
tectore sensitivity 1.1 < λ < 2.0 µm (sampling Hα at 0.70 < z <
2.0) over 15,000 deg2. A smaller area (2200 deg2) and a fainter
ﬂux limit (> 1 × 10−16 erg cm−2 s−1) is the baseline depth of
WFIRST-AFTA (Green et al. 2011) with a grism spanning the
wavelength range 1.35 − 1.95 µm.
The original predictions presented in the Euclid Deﬁnition
Study Report (the Red Book, Laureijs et al. 2011) used the pre-
dicted counts of Hα emitters by Geach et al. (2010). This model
was based on HubbleSpace Telescope and other data available
prior to 2010. Here, we provide an updated compilation of em-
pirical Hα LFs available in literature, and use the most recent
and veriﬁed ones out to zmax ∼ 2.3 to build three updated models
of Hα emitters counts. To provide precise predictions over the
redshift range of interest of NIR missions (i.e. 0.7 < z < 2) all
three models include estimates from the HiZELS narrow-band
ground-based imaging survey with UKIRT, Subaru and VLT
(Sobral et al. 2013), covering ∼ 2 deg2 in the COSMOS ﬁeld
at z = 0.4, 0.84, 1.47, 2.23; the WISP slitless space-based spec-
troscopic survey with HST+WFC3 (Colbert et al. 2013), sensi-
tive to Hα in the range 0.7 < z < 1.5 up to faint ﬂux levels
(3 − 5 × 10−17 erg s−1 cm−2) on a small area (∼ 0.037 deg2); and
the grism survey with HST+NICMOS by Shim et al. (2009), on
∼ 104 arcmin2 over the redshift range 0.7 < z < 1.9. To ex-
tend the models to a broader redshift range and better constrain
the evolutionary form, we include other luminosity functions
available at lower redshifts. Diﬀerent subsets of input data are
adopted in the three models to describe the evolution in redshift
of the HαLF, as well as to explore the robustness of the predic-
tions.

Our focus is on predictions for the yield of galaxy redshift
surveys, so we work in terms of observed Hα ﬂux, i.e. with no
correction for extinction in the target galaxy. Generally, in Hα
surveys direct measurements of extinction are unavailable, and
thus require purely statistical corrections. Usually an average
extinction of 1 mag. has been adopted by most of the authors
(see Hopkins (2004), Sobral et al. (2013)). In cases where such
corrections have been applied in the literature, we have undone
the correction. Furthermore, in many of the input data sets, Hα
is partially or fully blended with the [N ii] doublet, and the in-
ference of separate Hα and [N ii] ﬂuxes is based on diﬀerent as-
sumption on their ratio or on diﬀerent scaling relation. The lumi-
nosity functions presented here are for Hα only, not Hα+[N ii],
since future space missions, like Euclid and WFIRST-AFTA,
will have higher spectral resolution than HST and will be par-
tially able to resolve the Hα+[N ii] complex. The inferred Hα
luminosity function is sensitive to the prescription for the [N ii]
correction. In Appendix C we explore the eﬀects of diﬀerent
treatments.

In Table 1 we list the compilation of HαLF Schechter param-
eters provided by various Hα surveys spanning the redshift range
0 < z < 2 which are used in this work. We also list the subset of
data used in each model. Schechter parameters have been con-
verted to the same cosmology and to the original Hα extincted
luminosity, when necessary. The luminosities in HiZELS LFs
have been further corrected for aperture. These corrections are
based on the fraction of a Kolmogorov seeing disk of the speci-
ﬁed size (0.9, 0.8, 0.8, or 0.8 arcsec, full width at half maximum,
speciﬁed by Sobral et al. 2013) convolved with an exponential
proﬁle disk of half-light radius 0.3 arcsec. Similar correction has
been adopted by Sobral et al. (2015) within the same survey (see
their Section 2.4). Variations of this procedure are explored in
Appendix C, where we ﬁnd a 10% change in the abundance of
Hα emitters in the range relevant for Euclid if this correction is
turned oﬀ entirely, and a 2% change if the measured size-ﬂux re-
lation (Colbert et al. 2013) is used in place of a single reference
value.

Figure 1 shows the empirical HαLFs analysed and used in
our models, divided into several redshift bins from z = 0 (re-
ported in all panels) to z = 2.3. For clarity the Schechter ﬁts
and data have been plotted only in the range of luminosities cov-
ered from each survey; the Schechter parameters have been also
shown as a function of redshift (Figure 2). Besides the HαLFs
listed in Table 1 and shown in Figure 1, we have compared
fewer additional HαLFs available (Gunawardhana et al. 2013;
Lee et al. 2012; Ly et al. 2011), ﬁnding that they are consistent
with the data used in this work. In the highest redshift bin anal-
ysed we further compare the observed Hα LFs with the ones de-
rived indirectly from UV in a sample of LBGs at 1.7 < z < 2.7
(Reddy et al. 2008), ﬁnding it slightly higher than the direct ob-
served Hα LFs. Very recently new HαLFs have become available
at high redshift using larger area than before, both from narrow-
band imaging survey (CF-HiZELS, Sobral et al. 2015) and using

slitless spectroscopy from the analysis of a wider portion of the
WISP survey (Mehta et al. 2015). Both the new HαLFs are con-
sistent with previous determinations. In the following section we
compare our models to these new data. We have not attempted
instead to include in our models these new, but not independent,
LFs determinations which does not reduce cosmic variance sub-
stantially and in the case of Mehta et al. (2015) and Reddy et al.
(2008) have been derived indirectly from [O iii] lines and UV
ﬂuxes, respectively at high-z.

From the data analysed in this work, we note that in the
local Universe the shape of the HαLF is well established and
characterized across a large range of luminosities (Gallego et al.
1995; Ly et al. 2007). Over the past decade, improvements in
NIR grisms, slit spectroscopy, and narrow band surveys have al-
lowed the evolution of the LF to be tracked out to z ≃ 2 (see
references in Table 1), not only at the bright end but also be-
low the characteristic L⋆. However, we note that at z > 0.9 the
various empirical HαLFs start to disagree, as conﬁrmed by their
Schechter parameters. Despite the empirical uncertainties it is
clearly evident the strong luminosity evolution of the bright end
of the HαLF with increasing redshift, also conﬁrmed by the evo-
lution of L⋆ by about an order of magnitudes over the whole
redshift range. On the other hand, the amount of density evolu-
tion is still not completely clear, as well as the exact value and
evolution of the faint end slope, as attested by the evolution with
redshift of the φ⋆ and α Schechter parameters.

3. Modelling the Hα luminosity function evolution

As outlined in the previous section and shown in Figs. 1 and 2,
in the relevant redshift range for future Hα missions, existing
Hα LF measurements show large uncertainties and are often in-
consistent with one another. In light of these uncertainties, we
cannot recommend a unique model with only its statistical error

each redshift range. Observed Schechter LFs are shown as thin lines and squares in the observed luminosity range and listed in the labels. For
comparison, the LFs from Empirical Models 1, 2, and 3 are shown (in yellow, cyan, and pink, respectively) as thick lines in the same redshift range

associated, because this would be based on a predeﬁned evolu-
tionary and luminosity function shape. We, rather, present three
models based on diﬀerent treatments of the input data (named
“Model 1”, “Model 2” and “Model 3”, hereafter). In particular
we adopt three diﬀerent evolutionary forms to describe the un-
certain evolution of the HαLF. For the shape of the luminosity
function, three functional forms were considered. The simplest
is the Schechter function. We also adopt, diﬀerent methodolo-
gies, subsets of input data, and treatment of systematic errors to
explore the uncertainties and robustness of the predictions.

3.1. Model1

In this model we used a Schechter (1976) parametrization for
the luminosity functions and an evolutionary form similar to
Geach et al. (2010),

L⋆!α
φ(L, z) dL = φ⋆  L

e−L/L⋆

dL
L⋆

,

where
• φ⋆ is the characteristic density of Hα emitters;
• α is the faint-end slope;
Article number, page 4 of 16

(1)

• L⋆ is the characteristic luminosity at which the Hα luminos-
ity function falls by a factor of e from the extrapolated faint-
end power law. It has a value at z = 0 of L⋆,0;
• and e = 2.718... is the natural logarithm base.

We adopt the same evolutionary form for L⋆ assumed in

Geach et al. (2010), and introduce an evolution in φ⋆,

L⋆,z = L⋆,0(1 + z)δ

and

(2)

z < zbreak
z > zbreak

;

(3)

φ⋆,0(1 + z)ǫ

φ⋆,0(1 + zbreak)2ǫ(1 + z)−ǫ

φ⋆,z =(
thus φ⋆,0 is the characteristic number density today, which is
taken to scale as ∝ (1 + z)ǫ at 0 < z < z.break and ∝ (1 + z)−ǫ
for z > zbreak.
Because the Schechter parameters are correlated, we do not
rely on the evolution of the empirical Schechter parameters to
constrain their evolution since a unique or ﬁxed α value has not
been found or ﬁxed. We instead attempt to reproduce, by mean
of a χ2 approach, the observed luminosity functions at diﬀer-
ent luminosities and redshifts, as described by their Schechter
functions in the luminosity range covered by the observations.

Pozzetti et al.: Modelling the number density of Hα emitters

in Model 1 and 2. However, we do not recommend its use at
z . 0.6 since it does not incorporate the low-redshift data.

A ﬁt to the data also requires a likelihood function (or er-
ror model), in addition to central values for the data points. The
luminosity functions provided by individual groups contain the
Poisson error contribution, as well as estimated errors from other
sources (e.g. uncertainties in the completeness correction). The
construction of this model is complicated by two issues: cos-
mic variance and asymmetric error bars. The model for cos-
mic variance uncertainties is described in Appendix A. Our de-
fault ﬁts are performed using the CV2 model, which allows for
a luminosity-dependent bias. The alternative models are CV1,
which assumes a luminosity-independent bias, and a no-cosmic
variance model. Fitting large numbers of data points can lead
to statistically signiﬁcant biases if the error bars are asymmet-
ric and this is not properly accounted for in the analysis. The
treatment of asymmetric error bars is discussed in Appendix B.
We use the Poisson option for our primary ﬁts, and consider the
other variations in Appendix C.

Several models for evolving luminosity functions were in-
vestigated and model parameters were ﬁt using the MCMC. All
models require a break in the luminosity function to describe the
data; the break position L⋆ is taken to be a function of redshift,

Where necessary, we write L⋆,z to denote the characteristic lu-
minosity at redshift z. For the shape of the luminosity function,
three forms were considered. The simplest and most commonly
used is the Schechter function, but the exponential cutoﬀ is a
poor ﬁt to the observations. Two alternative models were con-
sidered to ﬁx this: a hybrid model

We, therefore, ﬁnd the best parameters (reported in Table 2)
α = −1.35, L⋆,0 = 1041.5 erg s−1, φ⋆,0 = 10−2.8 Mpc−3, δ = 2,
ǫ = 1, and zbreak = 1.3.

3.2. Model2

We adopt the same Schechter function for the LFs as for Model
1, but change the evolutionary form for L⋆ as follows:
log10 L⋆,z = −c(z − zbreak)2 + log10 L⋆,zbreak .
In this model we normalize the evolution of L⋆ to the maximum
redshift available (zbreak=2.23) and we assume no evolution for
φ⋆, i.e. ǫ = 0. Using the same ﬁtting method used for Model 1, to
reproduce the observed luminosity functions at diﬀerent redshift,
we ﬁnd the best ﬁt parameters (reported in Table 2) α = −1.4,
φ⋆,0 = 10−2.7 Mpc−3, c = 0.22, L⋆,zbreak = 1042.59 erg s−1 (ǫ = 0,
zbreak = 2.23).

3.3. Model3

Model 3 is a combined ﬁt to the HiZELS (Sobral et al. 2013),
WISP (Colbert et al. 2013), and NICMOS (Yan et al. 1999;
Shim et al. 2009) data only. The procedure was designed specif-
ically for use only in the redshift ranges under consideration for
the Euclid and WFIRST-AFTA slitless surveys (in particular at
0.7 < z < 2.23). As such, only the three largest compilations in
the relevant redshift and ﬂux range were used; in particular the
low-z data is not part of the Model 3 ﬁt and we do not display
Model 3 results at z < 0.6. We obtained the Model 3 luminosity
function parameters and their uncertainties using a Monte Carlo
Markov chain (MCMC). In Appendix C, we explore the depen-
dence of the Model 3 ﬁts on the assumptions, ﬁtting methodol-
ogy, and subsets of the input data used, which is a useful way to
assess some types of systematic error.

Model 3 has the advantage of being ﬁt directly to luminosity
function data points, and not to the analytic Schechter ﬁt, as done

The broken power law is the simplest function1 that interpolates
between a faint-end power law φ ∝ Lα and a bright-end power
law φ ∝ Lα+∆. Both of these models are empirically motivated:
they were introduced to ﬁt the shallower (than Schechter) cut-
oﬀ at high L. We also tried an alternative functional form used
for low-redshift FIR and Hα data (Saunders et al. 1990, Eq. 1;
Gunawardhana et al. 2013, Eq. 11), however the ﬁt is worse than
for the broken power law (χ2 is higher by 8.1, with the same
number of degrees of freedom) so we did not adopt it.

1 The factor of e − 1 = 1.718... in Eq. (7) does not lead to any physical
change in the model – it is equivalent to a re-scaling of the break lumi-
nosity L⋆. With the stated normalization, L⋆ is the luminosity at which
the LF falls to 1/e of the faint-end power law, which is the same mean-
ing that it has in the Schechter function; without this factor, L⋆ would
correspond to the luminosity at which the LF falls to 1/2 of the faint-end
power law.

The Schechter function has one fewer parameter than the
others, so in this case φ⋆ was allowed to have an exponential
evolution with scale factor a = 1/(1 + z),

log10 φ⋆,z = log10 φ⋆,1 +

with (d/da) log10 φ⋆ taken to be a constant. The broken power
law model was used for the reference ﬁt, since it gives the best
χ2.

These models have Npar = 6 parameters, 3 parameters be-
sides the standard Schechter parameters (φ⋆, α, L⋆), whose
meaning, is as follows:
• (d/da) log10 φ⋆ (for the Schechter function) characterizes
density evolution; it is positive if Hα emitters get more abun-
dant at late times.

• γ (hybrid model only) interpolates between an exponential
or Schechter-like cutoﬀ at high L (γ = 0) or a broken power
law form (γ = 1: the power law index changes by 2 between
the faint and bright ends). Values of γ > 1 are not allowed.
• ∆ (broken power law model only) is the diﬀerence between
• L⋆,z has a high-z extrapolated limiting value2 (L⋆,∞
) and a
value at z = 0.5 (L⋆,0.5). The sharpness of the fall-oﬀ in L⋆ at
low redshift is controlled by β. In some models, log10 L⋆,2.0
(the value at z = 2.0) was used instead of log10 L⋆,∞
to reduce
the degeneracy with β.

bright and faint-end slopes.

The three models diﬀer most strongly in their assumed form at
the high-luminosity end: the broken power law has a power law
scaling (with slope α−∆), whereas the Schechter function has an
exponential cutoﬀ. The hybrid model has an exponential cutoﬀ
if γ < 1, but its steepness is decoupled from L⋆ – as γ → 1,
the scale luminosity in the cutoﬀ L⋆/(1− γ) can be much greater
than the luminosity at the break L⋆.
The likelihood evaluation predicts the luminosity func-
tion averaged over a bin of log10 LHα and enclosed volume
[D(z)]3 using NG × NG Gauss-Legendre quadrature scheme
(for slitless surveys) or an NG-point Gaussian quadrature (for
narrow-band surveys, where there is no need to do a red-
shift average). The ﬁducial value of the quadrature parameter
is NG = 3. A ﬂat prior was used on the 5 or 6 parameters
(α, log10 φ⋆, log10 L⋆,2.0, log10 L⋆,0.5, β and γ or ∆, as appropri-
ate). Chains are run with a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm; at the
end a minimizing algorithm is run on the χ2 to ﬁnd the maximum
likelihood model.

The best ﬁt model (lowest χ2) is the broken power law model
with parameters (reported in Table 2) α = −1.587, ∆ = 2.288,
log10 φ⋆,0 = −2.920, log10 L⋆,2.0 = 42.557, log10 L⋆,0.5 = 41.733,
and β = 1.615 (and the corresponding log10 L⋆,∞ = 42.956).
The faint-end slope of α = −1.587 is 2.0σ shallower than the
ultraviolet LF slope of −1.84 ± 0.11 measured by Reddy et al.
(2008), and 1.5σ shallower than −1.73 ± 0.07 measured by
Reddy & Steidel (2009) at z ≈ 2. The residuals from this ﬁt are
shown in Figure 3.

Fig. 3. Residuals to the Hα luminosity function ﬁts for Model 3, plotted
as a function of observed-frame Hα ﬂux at the bin centre (horizontal
axis). All redshifts are plotted together. The green lines show the ﬁt line
and factors of 2 above and below. The error bars shown do not include
the cosmic variance, which is included in the ﬁt but is highly correlated
across luminosity bins.

The Schechter parameters for data and models are also shown,
only for illustrative purpose, in Figure 2. Note, however, that,
since the parameters are correlated, a direct comparison between
them is not straightforward, in particular Model 3 assumes also
a diﬀerent form for the LFs.

Given the large scatter in the observed LFs covering similar
redshift ranges, all the 3 models provide a reasonable description
of the data. Indeed, while it is diﬃcult to choose a best model,
among the three, overall they describe well the uncertainties and
the scatter between diﬀerent observed LFs, in particular at high-
z.

Comparing diﬀerent redshift bins, it is evident that at low-z
the models evolve rapidly in luminosity, as clearly visible also
in the evolution of L⋆ parameter, resulting in an increase of the
density of high luminosity Hα emitters. Since at high-z, instead,
all 3 models evolve mildly in luminosity and density, or even
slightly decrease in density (for Model 1), as a consequence the
density of high-L objects is almost constant.

Finally, we note that the main diﬀerence between the 3 mod-
els at all redshifts is at the bright-end of the luminosity func-
tion. Model 1 has the lower high-luminosity end, but is similar
in shape to Model 2, (both assuming a Schechter form), while
Model 3 has the most extended bright-end, while it is slightly
lower at intermediate luminosities, and has the steepest faint-end
slope. This occurs because of the diﬀerent functional form used
in Model 3. Current uncertainties in the bright-end of the em-
pirical HαLFs, do not allow strong constraint on the functional
form. Actually, recent analysis of GAMA and SDSS surveys
(Gunawardhana et al. 2013, 2015) and of WISP (Mehta et al.
2015) suggest a LF more extended than a Schechter function but
only at very bright luminosity (> 1043 erg/s). Further analysis on
wider area will provide new insight on this issue.

4. Comparison to observed luminosity functions

The three empirical models constructed are plotted in Figure 1
in diﬀerent redshift bins, and compared to the observed HαLFs.

5. Number counts and redshift distribution of Hα

emitters

2 Of course, at very high redshift the HαLF must fall oﬀ since there are
no galaxies. We remind the reader that the empirical models built here
may not be valid outside the range of redshifts spanned by the input
data.

The cumulative counts, as a function of Hα ﬂux limit, predicted
by the models are shown in Figure 4. We derive the cumulative
counts in the same redshift range covered by the WISP slitless
data, i.e. 0.7 < z < 1.5. For comparison we show the observed

WISP survey (Colbert et al. 2013) are shown (blue circles) and from new WISP analysis by Mehta et al. (2015) (cyan circles), and compared to
the empirical Model 1, 2, and 3, (blue, black and red lines, respectively). Also shown (as dotted lines and empty squares) are the counts obtained
integrating the observed LFs (see legend) in the same redshift range. Right panel: The same cumulative Hα number counts compared to the
predictions from L12 mocks (green dashed and solid lines using intrinsic and extincted Hα ﬂuxes, respectively) and GP14 mocks (dark and light
grey for H < 27 and H < 24 mocks, respectively).

Hα WISP counts, taken from Table 2 of Colbert et al. (2013) and
corrected for [N ii] emission as indicated in the original paper,
with LHα = 0.71(LHα + L[N ii]), for consistency with the WISP
Hα LF used here. Besides WISP counts, we show also the pre-
dicted counts using single luminosity functions at diﬀerent red-
shifts (integrated over the same redshift range 0.7 < z < 1.5).
The three models reproduce well the scatter between the ob-
served counts and observed luminosity functions, with Model

3 giving the lowest counts due to the large weight assigned to
the (lower amplitude) HiZELS and WISP samples.

At the depth and redshift range of the originally planned Eu-
clidWide grism survey (Laureijs et al. 2011), i.e FHα > 3×10−16
erg cm−2 s−1, and 1.1 < λ < 2.0 µm (sampling Hα at 0.70 < z <
2.0), Models 1, 2, and 3 predict about 2490, 3370, and 1220 Hα
emitters per deg2, respectively. This increases to 42500, 39700,
and 28100 Hα emitters per deg2 for FHα > 5 × 10−17 erg cm−2

s−1 as originally planned for the Deep Euclid specroscopic sur-
vey (see Table 3).

The WFIRST-AFTA mission will have less sky coverage
than Euclid (2200 deg2 instead of 15000 deg2), but with its
larger telescope will probe to fainter ﬂuxes. Its grism spans the
range from 1.35–1.89 µm.3 The single line ﬂux limit4 varies with
wavelength and galaxy size; at the center of the wave band for
a point source, and for a pre-PSF eﬀective radius of 0.2 arc sec
(exponential proﬁle), it is 9.5 × 10−17 erg cm−2 s−1. The three
luminosity functions integrated over the WFIRST-AFTA sensi-
tivity curve5 predict an available galaxy density of 11900, 12400,
and 7200 gal deg−2 (for Models 1, 2, and 3 respectively), in the
redshift range 1.06 < z < 1.88.

The previous community standard luminosity function
model, used for the 2011 EuclidRed Book (Laureijs et al. 2011)
and in pre-2012 WFIRST studies (Green et al. 2011), is that of
Geach et al. (2010) divided by a factor of 1.257. This luminos-
ity function predicts 7470 and 41500 Hα emitters per deg2 in
the same redshift range (0.7 < z < 2) and ﬂux limits (> 3 or
0.5 × 10−16 erg cm−2 s−1) of the original wide and deep Euclid
surveys. This is a factor of about 2–6 more than estimated here at
bright ﬂuxes and a similar number at faint ﬂuxes. The diﬀerence
is partly due to the factor of ln 10 ≈ 2.3 from the convention for
φ⋆ in the Geach et al. (2008) luminosity function, and partly be-
cause Geach et al. (2010) used the brightest and highest LF by
Yan et al. (1999) as the principal constraint in the z ∼ 1.3 range;
in contrast later WISP and HiZELS samples have found fewer
bright Hα emitters at this redshift.

Very recently, from the new analysis by Mehta et al. (2015)
of the bivariate Hα-[OIII] luminosity function for the WISP sur-
vey, over roughly double the area used by Colbert et al. (2013),
they expect in the range 0.7 < z < 2 about 3000 galaxies/deg2
for the nominal ﬂux limit of Euclid (> 3 × 10−16 erg cm−2 s−1)
and ∼ 20000 galaxies/deg2 for a fainter ﬂux limit (> 1 × 10−16
erg cm−2 s−1, the baseline depth of WFIRST-AFTA). We note
that these expectations are more consistent with our two higher
models, i.e. Model 1 and 2, than with our lowest Model 3. Figure
4 shows their counts at 0.7 < z < 1.5 (from their Table 4).

The redshift distributions (dN/dz) at various Hα ﬂux lim-
its (0.5, 1, 2, 3 × 10−16 erg cm−2 s−1) relevant to the Euclid and
WFIRST-AFTA surveys are shown in Figure 5. Besides the ob-
served WISP cumulative counts (from their Table 2, interpolat-
ing at the Hα ﬂux limits corrected for [N ii] contamination), we
show also dN/dz derived using single luminosity functions ob-
served at diﬀerent redshifts (integrated over the observed redshift
range and plotted at the central redshift of each survey). It is ev-
ident that the current scatter in the observed luminosity function
at z > 1, introduces a large uncertainty in the predictions, in par-
ticular at bright ﬂuxes. The diﬀerences between our three models
are due to the diﬀerent evolution and parametrization assumed
for the luminosity functions. In particular, as discussed in previ-
ous section, with Model 2 having a brighter L⋆ at high redshifts,
the predicted dN/dz is higher at bright ﬂuxes at z > 1.2. Clearly,
this is a regime where large areas data are almost not available,
and Euclid will cover this gap. At faint ﬂuxes, instead Model

3 The grism red limit was 1.95 µm in the original WFIRST-AFTAde-
sign; it was changed to 1.89 µm in fall 2014 due to an increase in the
baseline telescope operating temperature.

lution; the exposure time calculator (Hirata et al. 2012) now contains a
correction for this eﬀect.

size distribution in the WFIRSTexposure time calculator (Hirata et al.

1 and 2 are more similar, sampling the low luminosity end of
their similar LFs, with Model 1 having a slightly steeper LF and
higher φ⋆. Model 3 predicts a density of emitters that is a factor
from 1.5 to 2.5 lower than the other models from the faint to the
bright ﬂuxes considered, at all redshifts.

The new analysis by Mehta et al. (2015) of the WISP survey
is also shown in Figure 5. The number densities at z ∼ 2 have
been derived using the [OIII] line luminosity function, and as-
suming that the relation between Hα and [OIII] luminosity does
not change signiﬁcantly over the redshift range. The expecta-
tions are quite high but consistent within the error-bars with our
highest model.

In Table 3 we list the predicted redshift distributions in red-
shift bins of width of ∆z = 0.1, at various limiting ﬂuxes, for
the three diﬀerent models6. In addition we list also the expected
numbers for the 3 models at diﬀerent ﬂux limits and in the typical
redshift ranges for future NIR space missions. In particular for
the original Euclid wide/deep surveys, designed to cover in Hα
the redshift range 0.7 < z < 2.0 at ﬂux limit about 3/0.5 × 10−16
erg cm−2 s−1, using two grisms (blue+red), we expect about
1200/28000 – 3400/40000 objects for deg2. We note that for the
wide survey similar number densities can be reached using the
same exposure time but a single grism, for example covering the
redshift range 0.9 < z < 1.8 to a ﬂux limit of 2 × 10−16 erg
cm−2 s−1, we expect about 2000-4800 Hα emitters/deg2, there-
fore in total 30-72 million of sources will be mapped by Euclid.
For the Euclid deep survey an extension of the grism to bluer
wavelenghts, i.e. to lower redshift, for example 0.4 < z < 1.8,
will increase the number densities to about 32000–48000 deg−2
and therefore 1.3–2 million of emitters mapped in 40 deg2.

We remind the reader that these predictions are in terms of
observed Hα ﬂux, i.e. include intrinsic dust extinction in the Hα
emitters, and is corrected for [N ii] contamination. However, at
the nominal resolution of both Euclidand WFIRST-AFTA, these
lines will be partially blended; thus, here we may be underesti-
mating the ﬁnal detection signiﬁcance of the galaxies, i.e. the
sensitivity to Hα ﬂux is better than the single line sensitivity de-
scribed here, even if not by the full factor of the Hα:(Hα+[N ii])
ratio. For this reason, we expect that our analysis is somewhat
conservative.

Finally, future NIR space mission will use slitless spec-
troscopy and therefore suﬀer from some degree of contamination
in the spectra (depending on the rotation angles used), as well as
misidentiﬁcation of diﬀerent emission lines, which will decrease
the eﬀective numbers of emitters available for science. We note,
however, that unlike the WISP survey, both Euclid and WFIRST
will use multiple dispersion angles to break the degeneracy in
which lines from diﬀerent sources at diﬀerent wavelengths can
fall on the same pixel. Therefore the number of objects computed
from the HαLF should be reduced by the completeness factor be-
fore being used in cosmological forecasts. Preliminary estimates
of this factor have been included in the Euclid (Laureijs et al.
2011) and WFIRST-AFTA (Spergel et al. 2015) forecasts, and
the estimates of completeness will continue to be reﬁned as the
instrument, pipeline, and simulations are developed. The prob-
lem of sample contamination depends on the abundance of other
line emitters (i.e. not Hα), and the data available to reject them
– photometric redshifts and secondary lines. The rejection logic
is speciﬁc to each survey as it depends on wavelength range,
grism resolution (e.g. both Euclid and WFIRST-AFTA would

available. Pullen et al. (2016) present an example for WFIRST-
AFTA (combined with LSST photometry) that should achieve
a low contamination rate, albeit under idealized assumptions. It
is presumed that deep spectroscopic training samples will be re-
quired to characterize the contamination rate in the cosmology
sample. The redshift completeness factor could also be density
dependent, and its estimation will require mock catalogues with
clustering. The models presented here, therefore, will provide
a key input to instrument simulations that aim to forecast the
completeness of the Euclid and WFIRST-AFTA spectroscopic
samples.

6. Comparison to semi-analytic mock catalogs

We compare our empirical Hα models to Hα number counts and
redshift distributions from mock galaxy catalogues built with the
semi-analytic galaxy formation model GALFORM (e.g. Cole
et al. 2000; Bower et al. 2006). The dark matter halo merger
trees with which GALFORM builds a galaxy catalogue are ex-
tracted from two ﬂat ΛCDM simulations of 500Mpc/h aside,
diﬀering only by their cosmology: (i) the Millennium simula-
tion (Springel et al. 2005) with Ωm=0.25, h = 0.73 and σ8 =

0.90; (ii) the MR7 simulation (Guo et al. 2013) with Ωm=0.272,
h = 0.704 and σ8 = 0.81. Merson et al. (2013) provides a
method for constructing lightcone galaxy catalogues from the
GALFORM populated simulation snapshots, onto which ob-
servational selections can be applied, like an apparent H-band
magnitude limit. These lightcones come with an extensive list
of galaxy properties, including the observed and cosmologi-
cal redshifts, the observed magnitudes and rest-frame absolute
magnitudes in several bands, and the observed ﬂuxes and rest-
frame luminosities of several emission lines. For the present
work, we have analysed lightcones built with the Lagos et al.
(2012) GALFORM model7 (L12 mocks, hereafter) and with the
Gonzalez-Perez et al. (2014) GALFORM model8 (GP14 mocks
hereafter), using respectively the Millennium and MR7 simu-
lations. It is essential to point out that the model parameters
for Lagos et al. (2012) and Gonzalez-Perez et al. (2014) are cal-
ibrated using mostly local datasets, such as the optical and near-
IR galaxy luminosity functions. In particular, no observational

constraints from emission line galaxies are used in the calibra-
tion process.

We are most interested in the H band magnitude and the Hα
ﬂux. To assign galaxy properties, the stellar population synthe-
sis models from Bruzual & Charlot (2003) (GISSEL 99 version)
is used with the Kennicutt (1983) initial mass function over the
. To calculate the Hα ﬂux, the
range 0.15M⊙ < m < 120M⊙
number of Lyman continuum photons is computed from the star
formation history predicted for the galaxy. The Stasi´nska (1990)
models is used to obtain the line luminosity from the number of
continuum photons (T=45000 K, n=10 and Ns=1), testing that
the choice of the HII region properties from the Stasinska mod-
els does not have an impact on the number of Hα emitters. The
dust extinction law is the one for the Milky Way by Ferrara et al.
(1999). Broad-band magnitudes are reported on the AB scale.

In this work, we have analysed the light-cones constructed to
emulate the Euclidsurveys. In particular, in order to explore the
eﬀect of the selection on the density of Hα emitters, we have ex-
plored deep mocks selected in magnitude provided on diﬀerent
areas (100 deg2 limited to H < 27 for L12 mocks and 20 deg2
limited to H < 27 or FHα > 3 × 10−18 erg cm−2 for GP14 one).
In Figure 4 we show the cumulative number densities derived
using diﬀerent mock catalogues in the redshift range 0.7 < z <

1.5. The two light-cones, irrespective of the GALFORM version
used, underpredict the cumulative counts at all Hα ﬂuxes ex-
plored (from > 10−15 up to > 10−17 erg cm−2 s−1), i.e. they are
therefore in disagreement with the observed counts from WISP
survey and with most of the counts derived from empirical LF,
with the only exception of HiZELS Sobral et al. (2013). We have
also tested the eﬀect of limiting magnitudes on the Hα counts
from the GP14 mock, ﬁnding that a mock selected to H < 24
underestimates the density of Hα emitters but only at very faint
ﬂuxes (3 × 10−17 erg cm−2 s−1).
Finally, we compare the mocks with our empirical models.
We ﬁnd that the mocks predict counts, in the redshift 0.7 < z <
1.5, lower than our models; for example the GP14 mock is lower
than Model 1 by a factor 2 to 4.5 from faint to bright ﬂux limits.
The L12 mock predictions are even slightly lower than the GP14
mock.

We have also explored the eﬀect of dust extinction, showing
the cumulative counts for intrinsic Hα ﬂuxes (i.e. before dust
extinction applied) for the L12 mock in Figure 4. In this case
the simulated mock predicts very high number densities at bright
ﬂuxes (> 10−15 erg cm−2 s−1), above all the data available, but
agree with the two faintest data from the WISP survey, which
are close to the deep Euclid ﬂux limit. We note that the eﬀect

Pozzetti et al.: Modelling the number density of Hα emitters

of dust extinction is ﬂux dependent in the L12 mock. However,
also predictions using intrinsic Hα ﬂuxes and applying a dust
extinction of 1 magnitude (0.4 dex), as usually applied reversally
in the data, provide counts even lower than mocks shown and
ﬂatter than our 3 models and explored data.

In Figure 5 we further analyse the predictions for the redshift
distribution, at various ﬂux limits, from the light-cones. It is evi-
dent that redshift distribution from mocks, irrespective of the ex-
plored ﬂux limits, are consistent with data at low redshift, while
they are systematically lower than data at z > 1, despite the large
dispersion in the data. The number densities from GP14 mock
are lower than our models and data by a factor up to 10 at faint
ﬂuxes and z > 1.5. The L12 mock predictions are even lower
than the GP14 ones, in particular at z > 1.5, where at all ﬂuxes
except for faint ones, the number densities continue to decrease
with z and not present a ﬂattening as in the GP14 mock. At low
redshift, instead, the mocks cover relatively well the range of
number densities predicted by our models, being more similar to
Model 1, 2 at z < 0.7.

In addition, we have explored the eﬀect of a brighter H-band
magnitude limit (H < 24 compared to the original H < 27) in the
GP14 mock, ﬁnding that it does not aﬀect strongly the redshift
distribution at all ﬂux explored, but fainter one at high redshift
(z > 2). Finally, we note that only using intrinsic Hα ﬂuxes, i.e.
before dust extinction has been applied, the L12 mock predicts a
tail in the redshift distribution at high redshift (z > 1.5 − 2) and
bright ﬂux limits consistent with our empirical models or even
higher at z > 2 (note however that empirical models and data are
not corrected for dust extinction).

We remind the reader that the SAMs used here are not cali-
brated using emission line datasets. The predictions of mocks for
the HαLFs have been analysed by Lagos et al. (2014) (see their
Figure 1). In a future work (Shi et al., in preparation), we will
analyse in detail an optimization of the mocks to reproduce em-
pirical HαLFs, taking into account also the contribution of AGN,
which might aﬀect this comparison.

7. Hα luminosity density and star formation history

Finally, we consider the implications of our empirical models for
the global Hα luminosity density of the Universe, and the closely
related cosmic star formation history.

The Hα luminosity density is shown in Figure 6, as pre-
dicted by each model. We show the total (integrating the func-
tional form over all luminosities), along with the predictions by
each model imposing ﬂux limits at F > 10−16 erg cm−2 s−1 and
F > 3 × 10−16 erg cm−2 s−1. Note the excellent agreement for
the integrated luminosity functions, even though the bright end
is quite diﬀerent for the 3 models (being lower for Model 3). As
one can see from the dashed curves, the depth probed by BAO
surveys picks up only a portion of the overall Hα emission in the
Universe: for example, Models 1, 2, and 3 predict that 31, 39,
and 23 per cent respectively of the Hα emission passes the ﬂux
cut F > 10−16 erg cm−2 s−1 at z = 1.5. At z = 1.5, to represent
half of the overall Hα emission, we would need to lower the ﬂux
cut to (3.1 − 6.6) × 10−17 erg cm−2 s−1.
Also shown in Figure 6 is the observed (i.e. no corrected for
extinction) Hα luminosity density derived from the star forma-
tion history by Madau & Dickinson (2014) and Behroozi et al.
(2013) along with its dispersion. We, respectively, use the con-
version of LHα/SFR = 7.9 × 10−42 erg s−1 M−1
yr (Kennicutt
⊙
1998), appropriate for a Salpeter (1955) initial mass function
used by Madau & Dickinson (2014), and adding a factor of 1.7
boost, appropriate for the Chabrier (2003) initial mass function,

The solid thick lines show the total luminosity density, whereas the thin
solid curves show the luminosity density for emitters at F > 10−16 erg
cm−2 s−1 (upper set of curves) and F > 3 × 10−16 erg cm−2 s−1 (lower
set of curves). The diﬀerent colours are codes for each model (blue,
Model 1; black, Model 2; and red, Model 3). Also shown is the calcula-
tion of total Hα luminosity density based on the star formation histories

used by Behroozi et al. (2013). For consistency, the same receipt
used to correct for dust extinction in Hα surveys to derive the
above SFHs, has been used to correct them back, i.e. the de-
rived Hα luminosity density has been reduced by a factor of
100.4 in accordance with the commonly-assumed 1 magnitude
of extinction (Hopkins et al. 2004). This procedure is not an in-
dependent check, since Behroozi et al. (2013) refer to some of
the same data used in this paper, but does provide an assessment
of the overall consistency of the literature, particularly given that
Madau & Dickinson (2014) and Behroozi et al. (2013) consider
many other tracers of star formation (i.e. not just Hα) as well.
The agreement is within a factor of 2 diﬀerence at z ∼ 2 for
one of the star formation histories, and better for other cases –
we consider this good, given the uncertainties in the extrapola-
tion to ﬂuxes lower than that covered by Hα surveys. We fur-
ther note that the agreement is still recovered if we consider a
more sophisticated treatment of the dust extinction, varying it
with redshift as derived from the ratio between FUV and FIR
luminosity densities (Burgarella et al. 2013). However, this pro-
cedure introduces additional and uncertain assumptions on the
dust extinction law and on the ratio between the extinction in the
continuum and in the emission lines (Calzetti et al. 2000).

Finally, we note that on the contrary the SAMs consid-
ered in this paper predict a star formation density below the
values deduced from the observations at 0.3 < z < 2 (see
Lagos et al. (2014), Figure 3). We emphasize here that the ob-
served/exctincted Hα luminosity density is inferred after apply-
ing a correction for dust extinction and after extrapolation down
to faint unobserved Hα luminosities, introducing therefore fur-
ther uncertainties in the comparison with models.

8. Summary

The Hα luminosity function is a key ingredient for forecasts
for future dark energy surveys, especially at z & 1 where blind
emission-line selection is one of the most eﬃcient ways to build
large statistical samples of galaxies with known redshifts. We
have collected the main observational results from the literature
and provided three empirical Hα luminosity function models.
Models 1 and 2 have the advantage of combining the largest
amount of data over the widest redshift range, whereas Model
3 focuses only on ﬁtting the range of redshift and ﬂux most rele-
vant to Euclidand WFIRST-AFTA, but covered by more sparse
and uncertain data.

The three model Hα luminosity functions are qualitatively
similar, but there are diﬀerences of up to a factor of 3 (ratio of
highest to lowest) in the most discrepant parts of Table 3. This
is despite the small aggregate statistical errors (for example ±17
per cent at 2σ for Model 3 in the redshift range of 0.9 < z < 1.8
and FHα > 2 × 10−16 erg cm−2 s−1). Some of this is due to real
diﬀerences in the input data sets. In particular, our investigations
of the input data in Model 3 show that minor details in the ﬁts
(such as the treatment of asymmetric error bars and the ﬁnite
width of luminosity and redshift bins) as well as cosmic variance
aﬀect the outcome by more than the statistical errors in the ﬁts.
All of these models predict signiﬁcantly fewer Hα emitters than
were anticipated several years ago. However, even according to
our most conservative model, the upcoming space missions Eu-
clid and WFIRST-AFTA will chart the three-dimensional posi-
tions of tens of millions of galaxies at z & 0.9, a spectacular ad-
vance over the capabilities of present-day redshift surveys. For
instance, covering the redshift range 0.9 < z < 1.8 to a ﬂux
limit of 2 × 10−16 erg cm−2 s−1, we expect about 2000-4800 Hα
emitters/deg2, therefore in total 30-72 million of sources will be
mapped over 15 000 deg2 by the Euclid wide survey and 1.3-2
million of emitters will be mapped in 40 deg2 by the Eucliddeep
survey in the range 0.4 < z < 1.8 at ﬂuxes above 0.5 × 10−16
erg cm−2 s−1. At the WFIRST-AFTA sensitivity, we predict in
the redshift range 1 < z < 1.9 about 16 to 26 million of galax-
ies at ﬂuxes above ∼ 1 × 10−16 erg cm−2 s−1 over 2200 deg2.
The models presented here also provide a key input for the sci-
entiﬁc optimization of the survey parameters of these missions
and for cosmological forecasts from the spectroscopic samples
of Euclid and WFIRST-AFTA. The HαLFs derived here must
be folded through instrument performance, observing strategy
and completeness, and modelling of the galaxy power spectrum
in order to arrive at predicted BAO constraints. The previous
Euclid forecasts (Amendola et al. 2013) are currently being up-
dated with the new HαLFs and updated instrument parameters,
and we anticipate that the public documents will be updated
soon. The HαLFs presented here have already been incorporated
in the most recent WFIRST-AFTA science report (Spergel et al.
2015).

Appendix A: Cosmic variance

This appendix describes the treatment of cosmic variance in the
Model 3 ﬁts.

In the linear regime, the cosmic variance error covariance
between two luminosity function bins i and j coming from the
matter density ﬁeld is given by

CCV

i j =

φ(Li)φ(L j)

Nf

Z (bi + f µ2)(b j + f µ2)Pm(k, z) |W(k)|2 d3k

(2π)3 ,
(A.1)

where Nf is the number of independent ﬁelds, Pm(k, z) is the
real-space matter power spectrum at redshift z, f is the growth
rate (which boosts the cosmic variance in narrow-band surveys
due to redshift-space distortions), and W(k) is the window func-
tion, the Fourier transform of the survey volume, normalized to
W(0) = 1. We have used this result here assuming a bias of
bi = ¯b = 0.9 + 0.4z (from a semianalytic model, Orsi et al. 2010,
although there is evidence that the bias of star-forming galaxies
might be higher; see e.g. Geach et al. 2012). This reduces the
cosmic variance matrix to

CCV1

i j =

φ(Li)φ(L j)

Nf

Z (¯b + f µ2)2Pm(k, z) |W(k)|2 d3k

(2π)3 ,

(A.2)

(Here all the entries in the covariance are constant.)

The HiZELS error bars do not

incorporate a contribu-
tion from cosmic variance. However, we can estimate it from
Eq. (A.1) assuming the geometry of Nf = 2 independent boxes
of size 1 × 1 deg each. The depth in the radial direction is given
by the width of the narrow-band ﬁlter, and is ∆z = 0.020, 0.030,
0.032, and 0.032 at z = 0.40, 0.84, 1.47, and 2.23 respectively.
The faintest bins in HIZELS at z = 2.23 come from the HAWK-
I camera, and the survey volume is smaller in this case: it is a
single ﬁeld, with size 0.125 × 0.125 deg, and width ∆z = 0.046.
For the 4 redshift bins and the luminosity function bins where the
full ﬁeld has been observed, the implied diagonal elements of the
covariance are 0.100, 0.045, 0.032, and 0.025. For the HAWK-I
data (faintest objects at z = 2.23), we ﬁnd a variance of 0.256.

A more subtle issue is that the above procedure assumes that
the bias is independent of LHα. This assumption has been com-
monly used for the purpose of forecasting Hα survey perfor-
mance and its dependence on survey design. However, in com-
bination with Eq. (A.1), it implies that the cosmic variance con-
tributions in each bin are perfectly correlated. That means that a
ﬁt using Eq. (A.1) will assume that the shape of the HαLF has
no cosmic variance: the cosmic variance term will instead allow
only the normalization to ﬂoat up and down with an uncertainty
given by Eq. (A.1). Since cosmic variance is the largest contribu-
tor to the errors in some luminosity ranges, the procedure above
could lead to ﬁt results that are artiﬁcially well-constrained, if
the bias is in fact dependent on LHα. There is no reason for
db/d(log10 LHα) to be exactly zero, although for star-forming
galaxies it is not obvious which sign to expect. We have thus
explored the possibility of averaging the covariance matrix over
a range of possible bias models, constrained by some kind of
prior. A simple example of such a prior on the bias is that it de-
viates from the simple ﬁducial model according to a Markovian
process in log10 LHα,

hbii = ¯b, Cov(bi, b j) = c2

¯be−| log10 Li−log10 L j|/c2,

(A.3)

i j

(1 + c2

1e−| log10 Li−log10 L j|/c2).

which results in a modiﬁed cosmic variance term9
i j = CCV1
CCV2
Here c1 is the fractional prior uncertainty in the bias and c2 is
its correlation length in log10 L. The ﬁducial parameters taken
are c1 = 0.5 (50% scatter in the bias model) and c2 = 2 (2 dex
correlation length). As always with priors, these parameters are
somewhat ad hoc, but despite this drawback we expect that a
procedure with a range of bias models is more likely to be able
to approximate the real Universe than a ﬁxed-bias case (Ci j =
CCV1

) or the assumption of no cosmic variance at all.

(A.4)

There are thus 3 possible models for the incorporation of cos-

mic variance in the narrow-band luminosity function:
• No inclusion of cosmic variance (Ci j = 0).
• The simple,
• A random suite of luminosity-dependent bias models (Ci j =

luminosity-independent bias model (Ci j =

CCV1

).

The slitless surveys have a very diﬀerent geometry: they
probe tiny areas (e.g.
the WFC3 detector covers only 4.8
arcmin2), but they have a very long contribution in the radial di-
rection and usually have many more independent ﬁelds (Nf = 29
for WISP). For the 0.3 < z < 0.9 and 0.9 < z < 1.5 slices, the
predicted cosmic variance diagonal covariances for WISP are
0.0020 and 0.0014 respectively. The WISP luminosity function
includes the cosmic variance term, although the ﬁtting proce-
dure used here does not include the cosmic variance covariance
between luminosity bins. We have not attempted to add these in,
as the additional ∼ 4% standard deviation is negligible.
Appendix B: Poisson error bars

This appendix considers the asymmetry of the Poisson error bar
in the context of constructing a likelihood function for the Hα
luminosity function for Model 3. The procedure was inspired
by applications in cosmic microwave background data analy-
sis, where the anisotropy power spectrum has asymmetric (in
that case, χ2-shaped) error bars (Verde et al. 2003). A common
example is in power spectrum estimation, where the overall ﬁt
can be biased downward if symmetric error bars are assumed
because the lower data points have smaller error bars and pull
the ﬁt. For this reason, parameterized forms of the asymme-
try are common in reporting likelihood functions in the cosmic
microwave background community (see e.g. Bond et al. 1998,
2000; Verde et al. 2003). A similar phenomenon can occur in ﬁt-
ting a luminosity function: the Poisson error bar on a data point
that ﬂuctuates downward is smaller than on a point that ﬂuctu-
ates upward, so ﬁts to the raw luminosity function that treat this
error as symmetric will be biased toward lower φ(L, z). As an
extreme example, the likelihood function will even allow a ﬁnite
likelihood for φ(L, z) < 0, which is clearly unphysical. On the
other hand, treating the error on log10 φ(L, z) as symmetric will
bias φ(L, z) upward, since data points that ﬂuctuate upward will
have smaller error bars in log-space.

If the Hα luminosity function measurements contained only
Poisson errors, then the log-likelihood for a point with N objects,
a survey volume ∆V, and a bin width ∆L is
lnL = − ln(N!) − λ + N ln λ,
9 There are redshift-space distortion terms in Eq. (A.4) that we have
neglected; we do not believe the ﬁdelity of the model warrants a more
intricate correction.

where λ = φ ∆L ∆V is the expected number of objects. The max-
imum likelihood point is at λ = N, and so the log-likelihood
relative to the maximum is

ln L − ln Lmax = N(cid:18)1 −
The estimate of the luminosity function is ˆφ = N/(∆L ∆V), and
the estimate of its uncertainty is σln φ = 1/ √N, so this can be
re-written as

N(cid:19) .

with the + sign used if φ > ˆφ and the − sign if φ < ˆφ. We note
that the argument of the square root is always positive (or 0 if
φ = ˆφ), and that x is actually an analytic function of y = φ/ ˆφ− 1,
x = ±p2[y − ln(1 + y)] = y −
(B.5)

The real error bars need not have the same asymmetry as the
Poisson distribution in the cases where they are dominated by
other terms (e.g. cosmic variance). We therefore test for the sen-
sitivity of the results to the assumed ﬁtting scheme.

The covariance matrix C is re-written in terms of x, and the

(B.6)

This approach has the advantage that with one switch in the ﬁt-
ting code, the error asymmetry may be treated in 4 ways:
• Poisson: This uses Poisson-shaped errors (Eq. B.5).
• Symmetric-linear: This uses symmetric errors in φ, by setting
• Symmetric-log: This uses symmetric errors in log10 φ or ln φ,
• Symmetric-native: This uses errors symmetric in either φ or
ln φ, depending on which was reported by the analysis team.

by setting x = ln(1 + y).

x = y.

The Poisson shape for the error bars is probably the most real-
istic in the bins with small numbers of galaxies, but due to the
contribution of other errors it is not exact. Therefore we consider
other shapes as well (see Appendix C).

Appendix C: Variations and robustness of Model 3

In order to assess the robustness of Model 3, we re-ran the ﬁts
modifying some of the key aspects of the data handling. The
reference model is based on (i) use of all data sets; (ii) the bro-
ken power law model for the luminosity function; (iii) the CV2
cosmic variance prescription; (iv) the Poisson error bar asym-
metry model; (v) integration over luminosity and redshift bins
using NG = 3; (vi) HiZELS aperture corrections assuming a 0.3
arc sec half-light radius for all sources; and (vii) the [N ii]/Hα
ratio assumed in the input publications. We vary the reference
assumptions (functional function, CV, NG, error bars) and we
also considered extreme combinations of modiﬁcations to come

up with bounding optimistic (MAX) or conservative (MIN) esti-
mates of the HαLF. Relative to the reference ﬁt, the MAX ﬁt used
the combination of ﬁts to the bin centre; error bars symmetric
in log φ; and WISP+NICMOS data only. The MIN ﬁt used the
combination of error bars symmetric in φ; and HiZELS+WISP
data only. The main types of variations considered, and results
of the ﬁt are listed in Table C.1. We consider the predictions of
the models for the number of galaxies N2 above 2 × 10−16 erg
cm−2 s−1 and in the Hα redshift range (0.9<z<1.74).
The ﬁts with more simplistic treatment of the ﬁnite bin width
(using NG = 1 and the luminosity function at z = (zmin + zmax)/2
and log10 L = (log10 Lmin+log10 Lmax)/2) lead to higher predicted
counts. This is the result of Eddington-like biases: for a steeply
falling luminosity function10, a bin of width ∆ log10 L × ∆z con-
tains more galaxies than would be predicted based on the lumi-
nosity function at the bin centre. The reference ﬁt corrects this
eﬀect by incorporating it in the model. The NG = 5 case was
run as a convergence test, and shows ≪ 1σ changes. The dif-
ferences between the cases indicate the signiﬁcance of diﬀerent
ways of treating ﬁnite bin size. The uncertainties are largest for
the NICMOS data since large bins in both log L and z were used
in the NICMOS studies (Yan et al. 1999; Shim et al. 2009). The
eﬀect of this treatment is smallest for HiZELS since there is no
averaging over redshifts and the log L bins are narrow.

The choice of cosmic variance treatment (CV1 versus CV2)
matters little (≪ 1σ) in the integrated counts in the Euclidrange
FHα > 2× 10−16 erg cm−2 s−1 from switching between these two
models, although the faint-end slope changes by 1σ.
A bigger diﬀerence arises when the cosmic variance is arti-
ﬁcially turned oﬀ; this causes the predicted number of galaxies
to go up by 2σ. This behaviour is driven by the three lowest-
luminosity HiZELS points at z = 0.84, which have small formal
error bars (0.03 or 0.04 dex) and are actually above the WISP
counts.

The treatment of error bar asymmetries pulls the ﬁts in the
expected direction: treating the error bars as symmetric in φ leads
to a lower result by almost 2σ, and treating them as symmetric

in log10 φ leads to a higher result by almost 2σ, relative to the
Poisson-shaped error bar. The Poisson shape (reference) is the
best-motivated form, since we know that a major contribution to
the luminosity function error has this shape, but many past ﬁts
have been done with one of the two other shapes, and we do not
have a clear understanding of the asymmetry of the systematic
errors.

We performed ﬁts excluding each of the 3 major input sam-
ples Since the narrow-band HiZELS Hα luminosity function is
the lowest in the Euclid range, and the NICMOS results are the
highest, exclusion of HiZELS moves the predicted number of
galaxies up, whereas exclusion of NICMOS moves it down. The
diﬀerence between the highest and lowest result in this sample
jack-knife is 0.161 dex. This suggests that systematic errors are
contributing to the diﬀerences of these curves and that caution
should be exercised in interpreting joint ﬁts.

The alternative ﬁtting functions, especially the Schechter
function, lead to slightly greater number densities than the ref-
erence (broken power law). This is because they incorporate
an exponential cutoﬀ, and hence the existence of a few very
bright galaxies (> 5L⋆, particularly in the NICMOS data) pulls
the characteristic luminosity to larger values and increases the
number of objects in the intermediate range (∼ 2L⋆). However,
this same feature of the Schechter law means that it is a poor
ﬁt to the NICMOS observations, and it is disfavoured relative
to the broken power law model by ∆χ2 = 20, and in any case
the eﬀect in our ﬁducial range (FHα > 2 × 10−16 erg cm−2 s−1,
0.90 < z < 1.74) is only 1σ.
The reference aperture correction for HiZELS assumes a
half-light radius of 0.3 arc sec, which is consistent with objects
near the ﬂux limit of WFIRST-AFTA (see Colbert et al. 2013,
Fig. 11). We have tried two variations on this: an extreme case
of turning the aperture correction oﬀ, and a case of implement-
ing a variable galaxy size in accordance with the ﬁt provided in
§4.2 of Colbert et al. (2013). 11 The changes in the number of
objects in the range 0.90 < z < 1.74 and at FHα > 2 × 10−16 erg
cm−2 s−1 are −10% and −2% for the no aperture correction and
Colbert et al. (2013) correction cases, respectively.

11 For this ﬁt, the Hα luminosities were re-scaled, and the diﬀerential
luminosity function was appropriately transformed using the Jacobian
of the uncorrected-to-corrected ﬂux transformation.

The last modelling assumption that was varied was the as-
sumed [N ii]/Hα ratio, which enters because at low resolution
[N ii] and Hα are blended; thus Hα+[N ii] is measured, and Hα
is inferred under some assumed prescription for the line ratio.
The reference model is based on the Hα luminosity function di-
rectly from the published papers: this means that the assumed
[N ii]/Hα is that in the published papers (0.41 for NICMOS and
WISP; in HiZELS a variable ratio was used but the reported me-
dian is 0.33). Here [N ii] includes both doublet members, 6548
Å and 6583 Å; 75.4% of the ﬂux in the stronger 6583 Å line
(Storey & Zeippen 2000). This ratio is common at low redshifts,
however a range of values is observed, and in high-redshift
galaxies the [N ii]/Hα ratio is often observed to be smaller. We
have therefore investigated what happens under alternate as-
sumptions regarding the [N ii]/Hα ratio. First, the luminosities
were converted back to LHα+[NII] using the stated median ratios
in each input paper. Then the Hα+[N ii] luminosity function was
written as

φHα+[NII](LHα+[NII]) =Z φHα(LHα)p(x|LHα)

∂LHα

∂x (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)LHα+[NII]

dx,

(C.1)

where x = log10(L6583/LHα) is the relative line strength in dex
and LHα = LHα+[NII]/(1 + 10x/0.754). We built two alternative
models for the [N ii]/Hα ratio based on the hzi = 2.3 BPT dia-
gram of star-forming galaxies (Steidel et al. 2014). One model
(altNII1) uses the median [N ii]/Hα ratio from the Steidel et al.
(2014) sample, x = −0.90 dex (see Figure 5). The other
(altNII2) assumes a lognormal distribution; since the 84th per-
centile (+1σ) of the [N ii]/Hα ratio corresponds to x = −0.57
dex, we choose a median at −0.90 dex and a scatter of σx = 0.33
dex.
In the altNII1 model, the number of objects in the range
0.90 < z < 1.74 and at FHα > 2 × 10−16 erg cm−2 s−1 increases
by 45%; the weaker assumed [N ii] results in larger inferred Hα
luminosities, and this eﬀect is ampliﬁed by the steep luminosity
function. On the other hand, for the altNII2 model, which in-
cludes scatter as well, we ﬁnd a source density only 29% above
the reference model; the reduction occurs because the scatter
in [N ii] results in an Eddington-like bias that is corrected by
Eq. (C.1). While an improvement over the reference model in

some ways, the 29% increase in the altNII2 model may be
an overestimate, since (i) it applies a correction based on the
hzi = 2.3 BPT diagram even at lower redshifts, and (ii) the cor-
rection procedure is not technically correct for HiZELS, which
has a variable assumed [N ii] fraction and which may include
only part of the Hα+[N ii] complex in its band.12 There may also
be diﬀerences (whose impact has undetermined sign) between
the rest-frame ultraviolet selection in Steidel et al. (2014) and
Hα selection. Based on these considerations, we are not using it
to replace the reference model.

Finally, it is seen that the central values of the MIN and MAX
ﬁts for the number of objects in the range 0.90 < z < 1.74 and
at FHα > 2 × 10−16 erg cm−2 s−1 diﬀer by a factor of 2 (see
Table C.1).

12 The correction in Eq. (C.1) is an overestimate in cases where Hα falls
in the narrow bandpass and one or both of the [N ii] lines do not. It is an
underestimate if [N ii] 6583 Å falls in the narrow band and Hα does not,
but since Hα is almost always stronger this is not as much of an issue at
the top of the luminosity function.
