ABSTRACT
We present the ﬁrst detailed integral ﬁeld spectroscopy study of nine central void galax-
ies with M(cid:63) > 1010 M(cid:12) using the Wide Field Spectrograph (WiFeS) to determine how
a range of assembly histories manifest themselves in the current day Universe. While
the majority of these galaxies are evolving secularly, we ﬁnd a range of morphologies,
merger histories and stellar population distributions, though similarly low Hα-derived
star formation rates (< 1 M(cid:12) yr−1). Two of our nine galaxies host AGNs, and two
have kinematic disruptions to their gas that are not seen in their stellar component.
Most massive void galaxies are red and discy, which we attribute to a lack of major
mergers. Some have disturbed morphologies and may be in the process of evolving
to early-type thanks to ongoing minor mergers at present times, likely fed by tendrils
leading oﬀ ﬁlaments. The diversity in our small galaxy sample, despite being of similar
mass and environment means that these galaxies are still assembling at present day,
with minor mergers playing an important role in their evolution.

We compare our sample to a mass and magnitude-matched sample of ﬁeld galaxies,
using data from the Sydney-AAO Multi-object Integral ﬁeld spectrograph (SAMI)
galaxy survey. We ﬁnd that despite environmental diﬀerences, galaxies of mass M(cid:63) >
1010 M(cid:12) have similarly low star formation rates (< 3 M(cid:12) yr−1). The lack of distinction
between the star formation rates of the void and ﬁeld environments points to quenching
of massive galaxies being a largely mass-related eﬀect.

Key words: galaxies: evolution – galaxies: general – galaxies: stellar content – galax-
ies: kinematics and dynamics

1 INTRODUCTION

Galaxy evolutionary mechanisms can broadly be split into
two categories: environmentally driven and mass driven ef-
fects. The former category include processes such as galaxy
harassment (e.g., Moore et al. 1996), ram pressure strip-
ping (Gunn & Gott 1972), viral shock heating (e.g., Dekel &
Birnboim 2006; Cen 2011) and mergers (Toomre & Toomre
1972), whilst the latter include secular processes such as
AGN feedback (e.g., Croton et al. 2006) and mass quench-
ing (e.g., Kauﬀmann et al. 2003; Geha et al. 2012). Gen-
erally it is diﬃcult to separate these processes throughout
a galaxy’s lifetime, especially in high-density environments

where many of these mechanisms act on a galaxy simulta-
neously.

Examining the low-density regions of the Universe of-
fers an unparalleled view into galaxy evolution in isolation.
Filling the space between ﬁlaments and clusters, cosmic
voids are spatially the largest regions of the Universe (e.g.,
Arag´on-Calvo et al. 2010), with the lowest mean galaxy den-
sity (10-20 per cent of the mean cosmic density; Pan et al.
2012). Typical void regions are roughly spherically symmet-
ric, or prolate spheroids (Platen et al. 2008), with mean
eﬀective radii 17 h−1 Mpc (Pan et al. 2012).

Wide ﬁeld spectroscopic surveys such as the Sloan Dig-
ital Sky Survey (SDSS; Abazajian et al. 2009) delineate the
large scale structure of the cosmic web and allow the prop-
erties of the void galaxy population to be studied in de-

tail. Observationally, Pan et al. (2012) created a catalogue
of voids from the SDSS Data Release 7 (DR7) based on a
nearest neighbour technique that was employed by Hoyle &
Vogeley (2004) for the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey. These
studies conﬁrm that the few galaxies located within voids
typically lie close to the edges, leaving galaxies in central
regions extremely isolated.

The low density of cosmic void regions allow galaxies
to evolve in relative solitude, removing many environmen-
tal eﬀects. It is for this reason voids are excellent labora-
tories to study the secular eﬀects of galaxy and halo mass
on galaxy evolution. Many studies have found a strong de-
pendence on environment for several galaxy properties, par-
ticularly in voids. When compared to galaxies in denser en-
vironments, void galaxies are thought to posses higher spe-
ciﬁc star formation rates (e.g., Grogin & Geller 2000; Park
et al. 2007; von Benda-Beckmann & M¨uller 2008; Riccia-
rdelli et al. 2014; Liu et al. 2015), and are on average bluer
and discier than similarly luminous galaxies in denser envi-
ronments (e.g., Rojas et al. 2004, 2005; Hoyle et al. 2005;
Deng et al. 2008; Hoyle et al. 2012; Moorman et al. 2015).
These characteristics are generally attributed to a limited
opportunity for interactions due to their relative isolation,
leaving more gas available for star formation. Moorman et al.
(2016) ﬁnds void regions are particularly nurturing for dwarf
galaxies.

While a consistent picture of a bluer void galaxy pop-
ulation has been presented above, recent work instead ﬁnds
very little diﬀerence between galaxies in voids and those in
structure, especially when a multi-wavelength approach is
taken (e.g., Beygu et al. 2016). Penny et al. (2015) show no
diﬀerence in the mid-infrared (IR) colour of 592 galaxies lo-
cated in voids and an analogous sample of ﬁeld galaxies; a
wide spread in recent star forming activity is found through-
out both populations. Optically red void galaxies display a
range of mid-IR colour, suggesting dust-obscured star for-
mation or star formation occurring on the outskirts of the
galaxies, missed by single ﬁbre spectroscopy. This range of
mid-IR colour suggests a variety of assembly histories must
exist in the void galaxy population. This ﬁnding has been
backed up by smaller, multi-wavelength surveys such as Sage
et al. (1997), who detect CO emission from four Bootes void
galaxies that is comparable to that seen from interacting
ﬁeld galaxies. Beygu et al. (2013) and Das et al. (2015) also
detect molecular gas in void regions, inferring star forma-
tion rates and dynamical activity similar to that of galax-
ies in denser environments. Detailed, spatial studies of these
galaxies are needed to locate star forming regions within void
galaxies, the extent of this star formation, and the mecha-
nisms by which it is occurring.

Massive void galaxies constitute an unique population
as their high luminosity permits detailed studies into galaxy
kinematics and merger histories over relatively short in-
tegration times. The most massive void galaxies are the
central galaxy of their dark matter halo and have masses
M(cid:63) > 1010M(cid:12), similar to that of brightest group galax-
ies or small brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs; e.g., Oliva-
Altamirano et al. 2014). Their wide spread of current day
star formation, as shown in Figure 1, means that there must
be a mixture of mass growth processes at play over a range
of time scales. Simulations predict that mass is accumulated
through continued star formation fed by ﬁlaments of gas ac-

creting onto both isolated and central group void galaxies
(e.g., Kreckel et al. 2012; Beygu et al. 2013). This is con-
ﬁrmed observationally by Penny et al. (2015), who ﬁnd the
dominant morphology of high mass void galaxies is discy
with many red spirals (e.g., Masters et al. 2010; Bonne et al.
2015).

At masses greater than M(cid:63) > 1010M(cid:12) the mass as-
sembly histories of galaxies are increasingly dominated by
major mergers (Kauﬀmann et al. 2003; Baldry et al. 2004),
creating early-type galaxies that have quenched by current
times. This apparent disparity in formation history can be
resolved by spatial mapping of these massive void galaxies.
Are these galaxies evolving secularly as their isolated na-
ture would suggest, or have enough interactions occurred
that they have morphologically (and kinematically) trans-
formed?

Single ﬁbre spectroscopy often catches only old stellar
populations at the heart of massive galaxies, misdiagnosing
them as passive, though mid-IR photometry suggests these
galaxies are not as quenched as they appear (e.g., Penny
et al. 2015). In a wide-ﬁeld multi-object redshift survey, each
galaxy is targeted with just one ﬁbre. As we show in Sec-
tion 2.1, for massive low redshift galaxies, this ﬁbre will only
capture light from the central region of a galaxy, potentially
missing a star forming disc.

Integral ﬁeld spectroscopy (IFS) allows the features of
a galaxy to be spatially mapped by recording many spectra
of the same object simultaneously. Properties such as stellar
and gas kinematics, along with areas of star formation and
emission line regions can be mapped out to several eﬀective
radii, conveying a comprehensive, spatially resolved picture
of a galaxy. Traditional single object IFS units are able to
image one galaxy in extreme detail, though are observation-
ally expensive. The advent of multi-object IFS surveys such
as the SAMI galaxy survey (Croom et al. 2012), and Map-
ping Nearby Galaxies with APO (MaNGA; Bundy et al.
2015) will allow galaxy populations to be examined spatially
with number statistics like never before. These surveys are
currently in their infancy, and will take several more years
to build up statistically signiﬁcant samples targeting speciﬁc
galaxy sub-populations. It may take some time for a popu-
lation of rare objects such as massive, isolated void galaxies
to be observed.

We exploit this niche by targeting the small sub-
population of massive void central galaxies using the Wide
Field Spectrograph (WiFeS; Dopita et al. 2007, 2010) single-
object IFS instrument for a detailed study of their proper-
ties. In this study we aim to identify and classify any mor-
phological, kinematic or spectroscopic similarities in massive
central void galaxies and compare them to a mass-matched
sample of ﬁeld galaxies.

We present IFS observations of nine massive isolated
and central void galaxies along with a comparison sample
of nine ﬁeld galaxies to determine the relative contribution
of environmental and mass eﬀects to their current day ap-
pearance. The paper is organised as follows: in Section 2 we
deﬁne the GAMA massive isolated and central void galaxy
population and analyse any bias in our target selection sam-
ple. In Section 3 we describe the observations and data re-
duction, and in Section 4 we present the stellar and gas
kinematic derivations. Section 5 describes the star forma-
tion rates and in Sections 6 & 7 we present our results along

MNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)

with a comparison to a mass and magnitude-matched sample
of ﬁeld galaxies from the SAMI galaxy survey. Throughout
this paper we use a ﬂat ΛCDM cosmology with ΩΛ = 0.7,
ΩM = 0.3, and H0 = 70km s−1. A Salpeter (1955) initial
mass function (IMF) is used for all star formation rates and
stellar masses presented in this work unless stated otherwise.

2 VOID GALAXY TARGET SELECTION

We draw our central and isolated massive void galaxy tar-
gets from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA; Driver
et al. 2011) survey void catalogue of Penny et al. (2015). The
catalogue identiﬁes all galaxies within the GAMA equato-
rial survey regions located in the SDSS voids deﬁned by Pan
et al. (2012) using the Void Finder algorithm out to z ∼ 0.1.
The Void Finder algorithm is described in Hoyle & Vo-
geley (2002) and uses a nearest neighbour approach to ﬁnd
statistically signiﬁcant cosmic voids in volume limited wide-
ﬁeld redshift survey data. The method takes galaxies lo-
cated in ﬁeld or wall regions and computes the third nearest
neighbour distance, d3, for each galaxy. All galaxies with
d3 > 6.3h−1Mpc are considered as potential void galaxies
and removed from the sample. What remains are potential
wall galaxies, which are mapped and empty spheres grown
between the wall regions. If a sphere can be created with ra-
dius > 10h−1Mpc, the region is considered a void, and any
galaxies located within this void region are void galaxies.
Non-spherical voids are created by the addition of two neigh-
bouring regions if there is suﬃcient overlap. This method has
proven robust on both observational and simulated galax-
ies and dark matter. Average void density was found to be
< 20% of the cosmic mean at void edges, dropping to ∼ 10%
in central regions.
While the Pan et al. (2012) catalogue contains only
galaxies with magnitudes brighter than Mr = −20.09,
Penny et al. (2015) include all GAMA galaxies brighter than
Mr = −18.4. This fainter magnitude limit includes more
low-mass and low-surface brightness galaxies, and also de-
creases the size of the void regions as fainter, less-clustered
galaxies extend further into void regions from surrounding
ﬁlaments. For this reason, only galaxies out to 0.75 Rvoid are
included, ensuring isolation from large-scale structure. This
gives us conﬁdence that our void galaxies are indeed located
in bona ﬁde void regions, and not surrounding ﬁlamentary
regions. We check our void galaxies are in suﬃciently un-
derdense regions of the cosmic web by ﬁnding the 5th near-
est neighbour distance (d5) and surface density (σ5) of all
galaxies in the void sample using the Brough et al. (2013)
environmental measures catalogue, as shown in Figure 2. For
void galaxies within the GAMA G15 ﬁeld, we ﬁnd a median
environmental density of σ5 = 0.0745 Mpc−2, compared to
σ5 = 0.319 Mpc−2 for all galaxies in GAMA with z < 0.1.
We conﬁrm that the galaxies in our void sample are located
in under-dense regions of the Universe.

We make a further mass cut of log(M(cid:63)) > 1010M(cid:12) and
use the GAMA galaxy group catalogue of Robotham et al.
(2011) to select only isolated and central group galaxies in
our sample and remove interlopers. Only galaxies with pub-
licly available GAMA SFRs (Hopkins et al. 2013) and stellar
masses (Taylor et al. 2011) were included in this work.

The ﬁnal sample of massive void galaxies comprises 76

not available, so WISE W 3 12µm-derived SFRs using the rela-
tion of Cluver et al. (2014) were used instead. The isolated and
central galaxies within voids cover a wide range of star formation
rates, extending through both the red sequence and blue cloud,
suggesting multiple assembly histories of these galaxies.

isolated void galaxies, and 37 central group galaxies residing
in groups of ﬁve members or less, all with z < 0.1. These
galaxies are all the most massive objects in their dark mat-
ter haloes. We draw our observing targets from this sample,
and supplement with SDSS galaxies of the same constraints
outside of the GAMA survey right ascension limits due to
observing time constraints. We perform the additional mag-
nitude cut of mr < 15.7 to reduce integration times and
maximise signal to noise. At our average redshift of z ∼ 0.03,
this corresponds to an absolute magnitude of Mr = −20. Ta-
ble 1 lists all galaxies observed for this work. It is important
to note that while our target galaxies have been drawn from
the very central regions of voids, this does not mean they
are in regions free of large-scale structure; tendrils and even
ﬁlaments of galaxies have been shown to extend deep into
voids. Alpaslan et al. (2014) showed that the deeper the
magnitude cut, the more structure was revealed in voids,
stating as few as 25 per cent of the original void galaxies
deﬁned by Pan et al. (2012) are actually isolated.

2.1 Motivation - Are the reddest of massive void

galaxies secularly evolving?

Despite their similar environmental conditions, void galax-
ies do not constitute an homogeneous population. Figure 1
shows the star forming ‘main sequence’ for all GAMA sur-
vey galaxies with z < 0.05. Void galaxies from the Penny
et al. (2015) sample above our mass cut of M(cid:63) > 1010M(cid:12)
and apparent magnitude limit of mr < 15.7 are also in-
cluded as orange squares. The galaxies observed for this
work with available GAMA SFRs are shown as yellow stars,

galaxies in the Penny et al. (2015) void galaxy catalogue with

(2013) (blue points, with a blue median line of 0.0745 Mpc−2).
All GAMA galaxies with z < 0.1 in this catalogue are shown as
grey points with a grey median line value of 0.319 Mpc−2, and
those observed for this work in the GAMA catalogue are shown
as pink stars. On average, the void galaxies in our sample (and
all those observed) are located in regions of lower environmental
density than galaxies in all environments in GAMA.

and those without instead with Wide-ﬁeld Infrared Survey
Explorer (WISE) W 3 band SFRs are shown as purple stars.
The WISE SFRs are Hα SFRs derived from the 12µm lu-
minosity relation of Cluver et al. (2014). For void galaxies
above the mass cutoﬀ, both isolated and central void galax-
ies show a spread in SFR of several dex. The presence of
these void galaxies in both the red sequence and blue cloud
at present day indicates a spread in quenching times and
assembly histories, even for galaxies of similar mass.

A colour-magnitude diagram of the massive void galax-
ies reveals just 13 per cent are classiﬁed as red-sequence
objects using the Baldry et al. (2004) line. If we apply our
magnitude limit of mr < 15.7, just nine red sequence and
seven blue cloud galaxies remain. We chose to target the
reddest galaxies of this sample for our study, as they are
the best place to look for the occurrence of mass quenching
and constitute an interesting subsample, since in general,
void galaxies tend to be bluer than the ﬁeld. We wish to
determine whether these galaxies have received enough ex-
ternal stimulus to evolve into early-type galaxies to match
their red colour, or if we are studying a sample of pristine
disc galaxies in the process of secular evolution only. While
these galaxies have low Hα ﬁbre ﬂuxes consistent with opti-
cally red galaxies in Figure 1, their mid-IR colours suggest
a moderate excess of 12µm emission for at least half of the
galaxies targeted.

We wish to examine our massive void galaxy sample
using integral ﬁeld spectroscopy since traditional ﬁbre spec-
troscopy will often miss regions of star formation in the out-
skirts of large, nearby galaxies (e.g., Pracy et al. 2014). As an
example, we present the central void galaxy CGCG 013-075
in Figure 3. This galaxy is a face-on, barred spiral with blue,
star forming arms as shown in the SDSS colour image (Fig-

ure 3a). The SDSS ﬁbre diameter is 3(cid:48)(cid:48), and the spectrum
of this central region of the galaxy is plotted in Figure 3b
in red, and 950 stacked spaxels from the WiFeS IFS with a
ﬁeld of view of 25(cid:48)(cid:48) × 38(cid:48)(cid:48) and covering the entire galaxy out
past an eﬀective radius is plotted in blue. The Hα region
of the spectra is highlighted in yellow. We see that the Hα
line is much more pronounced in the IFS spectrum, which
includes much of the galaxy, rather than just the central
1.5(cid:48)(cid:48), as in the SDSS spectrum. This is a ‘typical’, discy void
galaxy, with a red bulge, but star formation occurring in
the outer regions. Galaxies such as this may be common in
void regions, where interactions may not have been frequent
enough to remove star forming discs. Could the void cen-
tral galaxies in Figure 1 be mis-plotted on the star forming
main sequence due to small ﬁbre size missing star forming
regions? It is for these reasons we seek to spatially examine
massive void properties.

2.2 How Pristine are these Void Galaxies?

We check the likelihood that these galaxies have lived their
entire life in voids, and have not been ejected from large
scale structure. To do this we estimate the maximal distance
a galaxy can travel in a Hubble time. If we assume a galactic
expansion rate of ∼10 Mpc /Ht, and the exemplar peculiar
motion of a galaxy over a Hubble time is ∼2-3 Mpc, the fur-
thest a galaxy can travel over a Hubble time is the addition
of these two terms, ∼12-13 Mpc. Pan et al. (2012) state the
average void radius is 17h−1 Mpc (∼12 Mpc using H0=70
km s−1). So while it is physically possible that galaxies from
large-scale structure may end up in voids, it is not likely, as
over time, galaxies are generally gravitationally attracted
towards regions of large-scale structure. While it is feasi-
ble a low-mass dwarf galaxy could be ﬂung into a void, the
chance that one of our high-mass central void galaxies has
been cast out of large-scale structure is low, as it would have
had to occurred at very early times and move in the correct
direction to come to be located in the central regions of a
void at current times. We may be reasonably conﬁdent that
all central void galaxies have lived their entire life in voids.
While this would point to them having experienced secular
evolutionary processes their entire lives, we stress that this
does not preclude interaction with other void galaxies (e.g.,
Hirschmann et al. 2013).

3 OBSERVATIONS & DATA REDUCTION

Observations were taken over two, six night periods from
2014 March 5th–10th and 2015 March 23th–28th using the
Wide Field Spectrograph (WiFeS; Dopita et al. 2007, 2010)
on the Australian National University’s 2.3m telescope at
Siding Spring Observatory. WiFeS is a dual beam, image
slicing IFS with a ﬁeld of view of 25(cid:48)(cid:48) × 38(cid:48)(cid:48), consisting of 25
×1(cid:48)(cid:48) slitlets of 38(cid:48)(cid:48) length. If the data are binned 2×1 in the
y direction, the resulting spaxel size is 1(cid:48)(cid:48) × 1(cid:48)(cid:48). The B3000
(∼ 3500−5800˚A) and R3000 (∼ 5300−9000˚A) gratings were
used along with the RT560 dichroic, resulting in a spectral
resolution of σ (cid:39) 100 km s−1 for both the red and blue
arms. This wavelength range for our low-z target sample
includes the Hα, Hβ, Hδ and Hγ Balmer lines, along with
forbidden lines [NII], [SII], [OIII], the 4000 ˚A break and the

of three times, to allow removal of cosmic rays via median
recombination. Table 1 lists all void galaxies observed.

The data were reduced using the dedicated WiFeS data
reduction pipeline (pywifes; Childress et al. 2014). The
python routine includes bias subtraction, ﬂatﬁelding, wave-
length calibration, sky subtraction, cosmic ray removal and
ﬂux calibration using spectrophotometric standard stars.
The ﬁnal product is two data cubes, one red and one blue,
for each galaxy.

4 STELLAR AND GAS KINEMATICS

The stellar and gas kinematics of each galaxy (velocity and
line-of-sight velocity dispersion, σ), were analysed using the
penalized pixel ﬁtting (pPXF) method of Cappellari & Em-
sellem (2004). To improve the signal to noise (S:N) of the
outer regions of the galaxy, the data cubes were ﬁrst Voronoi
binned to obtain a S:N of 15 per bin for the red arm and 5 per
bin for the blue arm using the python script of Cappellari
& Copin (2003). The diﬀerence in S:N cuts is because the
WiFeS blue arm camera is less sensitive than the red. Cap-
pellari & Emsellem (2004)’s Voronoi binning technique ac-
cretes spaxels (beginning at the brightest spaxel of a galaxy)
into a bin until the target S:N is reached with constraints on
bin shape. While the central spaxels generally provided high
enough S:N, most outer regions of low galaxy surface bright-
ness needed signiﬁcant binning. As outer regions comprised
bins of several spaxels which were not velocity shifted before
analysis we expect some smearing of emission lines aﬀecting
kinematic analysis. These bins also didn’t usually reach the
target S:N and were therefore not used in our emission line
analyses however. The stellar continuum was modelled using
a subset of the Indo-U.S. Library of Coud´e Feed Stellar Spec-
tra templates (Valdes et al. 2004) covering a range of stellar
ages and metallicities. These templates were chosen for their
long wavelength coverage (3460˚A - 9464˚A) and high spec-
tral resolution (FWHM = 1.35˚A). Gas emission lines were
ﬁtted simultaneously to avoid the need for masking by mod-
ifying the example ppxf population gas example sdss.py
provided in the pPXF package. Emission lines were ﬁtted
using a single Gaussian proﬁle. Figure 4 shows an example
pPXF ﬁt to the central spaxel of the void galaxy CGCG
019-064 around the Hα region.

An error approximation for the stellar kinematics was
completed by performing 100 Monte Carlo realisations of
the best ﬁt output by pPXF for each Voronoi bin of every
galaxy. To do this, random noise is added to the best ﬁt, then
the pPXF ﬁt performed 100 times. The standard deviation
of the weighted mean of all the ﬁts with the random noise
added is our uncertainty in our velocity, velocity dispersion
and emission line values.

5 FLUXES, EQUIVALENT WIDTHS AND

STAR FORMATION RATES

Emission line ﬂuxes are calculated by numerically integrat-
ing the area underneath the pPXF emission line ﬁts. Hα
emission line equivalent widths (EWs) are calculated from
these ﬂux values and the continuum levels ∼ 30˚A either side
of the Hα line.

only the red, passive central bulge region of the galaxy,
the WiFeS IFS summed spectra catch the blue spiral
arm regions and associated Hα emission.

of Hα in SDSS spectrum is obvious, illustrating how
important capturing an entire galaxy is, and how aper-
ture bias may aﬀect SFR estimates for large, nearby
galaxies.

back and forth between object and sky regions more rapidly,
providing a more real-time sky spectrum, and facilitating
better sky subtraction. Weather conditions were a mixture of
clear and patchy cloud, with an average seeing of 2(cid:48)(cid:48) in non-
photometric conditions. Each ﬁeld was observed a minimum

Figure 4. An example of a pPXF ﬁt for the central spaxel of the
void galaxy CGCG 019-064 around the Hα region (second emis-
sion line from the left). The original galaxy spectrum is in black,
the best ﬁt pPXF stellar continuum ﬁt in red, single gaussian-
ﬁtted emission lines in blue, and residuals in green. Note the extra
emission ﬂux added to the Hα line after correcting for ﬂux lost
due to stellar Balmer absorption.

As we have modelled and subtracted the stellar continuum
using pPXF, we do not need to include any stellar absorp-
tion corrections, though we must account for obscuration by
dust in our derived star formation rates. We calculate the
Hα-derived star formation rates (SFR) of our galaxies by
using the SFR relation employed by Richards et al. (2016):

(cid:18) BD

(cid:19)2.36

2.86

SFR(M(cid:12) yr

−1) =

FHα × 4πD2
1.27 × 1034W

L

×

,

where FHα is the integrated Hα ﬂux in W m−2, DL is the
luminosity distance in m, and 1.27×1034W is the conversion
factor to convert to solar masses per year, as given by Kenni-
cutt (1998) assuming a Salpeter (1955) IMF and solar metal-
lically. BD is the Balmer decrement of the stellar absorption-
corrected ratio of Hα to Hβ emission line ﬂuxes assuming a
Case-B recombination value of 2.86 (Calzetti 2001) with a
reddening slope of 2.36 (Cardelli et al. 1989) and the dust as
a foreground screen averaged over the galaxy. Balmer decre-
ment values varied from spaxel to spaxel throughout each
galaxy, and where either Hα or Hβ measurements weren’t
available for a given spaxel, we take the average Balmer
decrement of the neighbouring spaxels. As an example, for
the galaxy CGCG 013-075, Balmer decrement values span
the range from ∼2.9 on the outskirts to 6.5 in the central
regions.

The SFR is calculated for each Voronoi bin above the
target S:N, then added together to get the total SFR for a
galaxy. Table 1 compares the SFRs calculated in this work
with optical (GAMA) and mid-IR (WISE) integrated SFRs
from the literature. The WISE SFRs are calculated using the
relation of Cluver et al. (2014), which is derived using the
GAMA SFR relation of Wijesinghe et al. (2011), assuming
the IMF deﬁnition of Baldry & Glazebrook (2003). Stellar
emission has been subtracted from the W 3 band using the
W 2 band, leaving just emission from hot dust associated
with star formation. Gunawardhana et al. (2013) ﬁnd the

IMF results in a SFR approximately a factor of 2.4 lower.
We therefore multiply the Cluver et al. (2014) SFRs by a
factor of 2.4, for a comparison to the values presented in
this work using the Richards et al. (2016) relation.

6 RESULTS & DISCUSSION

6.1 Secularly Evolving Void Galaxies

Firstly, we morphologically classify our galaxies, using the
SDSS colour images shown in Figure 5. We see that eight of
the nine galaxies observed have obvious discs. Of these, we
visually classify four galaxies as spiral, one of which has blue
arms, the other three are red. Four galaxies have lenticular
morphology, and the ﬁnal galaxy is disturbed.

Our morphological classiﬁcations are conﬁrmed by Fig-
ure 6, where we present the stellar (solid line) and gas
(dashed line) velocity curves for all void galaxies in our
sample extracted along the kinematic major axis of each
galaxy. The stellar kinematics show all nine galaxies are ro-
tating regularly with a maximum velocity of several hundred
km s−1. The rapid rotation implies these galaxies are (or re-
cently have been) discs. The discy nature of the galaxies in
our sample coupled with high stellar mass implies isolation,
and a secular evolutionary history.

In Figures 7 and 8 we present maps of stellar and gas
kinematics respectively. The constant rotation of the stellar
kinematics further conﬁrm the discy nature of these galax-
ies. The gas kinematics matches the stellar for most of the
galaxies in our sample, leading us to conclude they have
had no recent interactions, and conﬁrming their secularly
evolving nature. For the galaxy CGCG 010-071, the cen-
tral regions of the gas and stelar kinematic maps show some
discrepancy, leading to central velocity diﬀerences between
gas and stellar components along the kinematic major axis
of several hundred km s−1. Nair & Abraham (2010) clas-
sify this galaxy as a barred spiral, and we suggest the gas
kinematics are being disrupted in the central regions by the
presence of a galactic bar (e.g., Masters et al. 2011).

From Figure 5 we see that IC 0566 has an obvious
extension in the South West corner, likely the result of a
recent merger. Mergers can disturb gas kinematics whilst
still maintaining regular rotation of stellar kinematics.
Indeed, from Figures 7 and 8, we see that while the stellar
component is rotating regularly, the gas kinematics are
highly variable from spaxel to spaxel. As this galaxy has
very little nebular emission detected from the pPXF ﬁt in
its central regions, the gas velocity can only be determined
for the spaxels which have reliable emission line informa-
tion. Despite this, those with gas velocity information are
signiﬁcantly variable enough to suggest the gas in this
galaxy is very disturbed. In combination with the visual
asymmetry of this galaxy, we conclude it is undergoing
or has recently undergone a merger. We investigate the
literature to determine the likely merger scenario that may
have occurred.

Hirschmann et al. (2013) performed a detailed statis-
tical analysis of isolated model galaxies extracted from the
Millennium simulation (Springel et al. 2005). They found

MNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)

IFS of Massive Void Galaxies

that ∼ 45% of isolated galaxies at z=0 have experienced
at least one merger event in their lifetimes, most of which
were minor (< 1 : 4 mass ratio). A small fraction of iso-
lated galaxies in their sample were bulge-dominated, whose
bulges had been built mainly from minor mergers. Penny
et al. (2015) also used the Millennium simulation to ﬁnd
the time since last merger for isolated, massive void galax-
ies. They ﬁnd that the major merger histories of massive
void galaxies diﬀer signiﬁcantly from non-void galaxies. The
major merger rates are typically much lower than non-void
galaxies and almost negligible at current times. One per cent
of void galaxies with M(cid:63) > 5 × 1010M(cid:12) have undergone a
major merger in the last 5 Gyr (compared to 21 per cent of
the total galaxy population in this mass range), demonstrat-
ing that the dominant morphology of massive void galaxies
remains discy. A larger fraction of major mergers is eﬀec-
tively ruled out by ΛCDM cosmology as the cause of the gas
disruption in our galaxies, so we assume that minor merg-
ers and gas accretion are the cause. We now investigate the
chance an isolated void galaxy will experience an interaction
at current times.

Observationally, examples exist of interacting systems
in void regions. In fact, the HI discs of galaxies in voids
are just as likely to be disturbed as they are undisturbed.
The void galaxy survey (Kreckel et al. 2012) imaged 60 void
galaxies in HI to ﬁnd that ∼50 per cent show strongly dis-
turbed gas morphology or kinematics, ∼8 per cent of which
are clearly interacting with companions. Beygu et al. (2013)
study an interacting system of three galaxies embedded in a
common HI envelope. A tidal tail is seen on one of the galax-
ies, attributed to a recent minor merger. While this system
is likely very unusual, it does contribute along with the in-
teracting galaxies in Kreckel et al. (2012) to the anecdotal
evidence that minor mergers in voids are still occurring at
current times.

While we did not select our sample based on disturbed
morphology, our results conﬁrm those of Kreckel et al.
(2012), that interacting void galaxies are not uncommon,
and the dominant method of interaction is minor mergers.
We investigate current day SFRs in Section 6.2 to determine
whether these mergers were likely to have been wet or dry.

6.2 Hα Maps and Star Formation in Massive,

Central Void Galaxies

In Figure 9 we present the normalised Hα emission line maps
for the nine void galaxies in our sample. For all but one
galaxy (CGCG 019-064) we see a common scenario emerg-
ing of a low relative amount of Hα emission in the cores
of these galaxies, and a younger stellar population in the
disc regions of the galaxies. This Hα distribution is what we
would expect for a disc galaxy population, and conﬁrms the
notion that these galaxies are secularly evolving. For CGCG
019-064, we investigate whether the central concentration of
Hα is either nuclear star formation or AGN activity in Sec-
tion 6.3.

We calculate SFRs from these Hα emission line maps
using Equation 1, and in Table 1 we present the total inte-
grated SFR of all galaxies in our sample. All galaxies possess
SFRs < 1 M(cid:12) yr−1. These SFRs are surprisingly low, given
their predominantly discy morphology. We expect that our
total integrated SFRs underestimate the true SFR of the

galaxy for two reasons. A minor ﬂux calibration issue was
discovered when comparing the WiFeS spectra to their Sloan
r-band ﬂux at the r-band eﬀective wavelength. This ﬂux dis-
crepancy is likely due to non-photometric conditions whilst
observing. As a result, we ﬁnd total continuum (and hence
Hα) ﬂux to be underestimated by ∼ 20%, which propagates
to an underestimation of SFR of ∼ 20%. Additionally, the
Voronoi bins that do not reach the target S:N on the out-
skirts of the WiFeS ﬁeld of view were not counted towards
the total SFR value. This resulted in a smaller area of the

galaxy being covered than anticipated, potentially missing
some star forming areas of the disk. As Figure 9 shows, this
is where the younger stellar population of the majority of
these galaxies lie.

To assess the eﬀect this has on the total SFRs, we com-
pare our integrated SFRs to that of the photometrically-
derived SFRs using WISE 12µm band colour from the rela-
tion of Cluver et al. (2014), and GAMA ﬁbre SFRs. In gen-
eral, we ﬁnd the ﬁbre-derived SFRs are systematically lower
than the total integrated SFRs from this work. We expect

of both distance from galaxy centre (kpc) and fraction of the SDSS exponential ﬁt radius, expRad r, corrected for galaxy inclination.
Error bars denote the MC error for the pPXF ﬁt to the Voronoi bin. Kinematics derived from Voronoi bins that didn’t reach the target
S:N (those on the edges) are not included. The gas and stellar kinematics, both derived using pPXF, match up well in the central regions
(where there is high S:N) for all but two galaxies - IC 0566 and CGCG 010-071, which we expect merger activity and a galactic bar
disrupting gas ﬂow to be the cause of the obviously disturbed gas morphologies.

this is because the aperture corrections applied assume the
galaxy outskirts are as red and passive as the nuclear region,
as illustrated in Figure 3. In contrast, the WISE SFRs are
systematically higher than those calculated in this work.

SFR discrepancies are most noticeable in the galaxies
with large angular size. Reassuringly, our smallest galaxy,
GAMA 534760, which ﬁts comfortably in the WiFeS ﬁeld
of view, has a SFR that compares well to the WISE SFRs.
Perhaps not surprisingly, since these galaxies are optically
red, we do not see any evidence of substantial ongoing levels
of star formation.

6.3 AGN activity

While we assume that any detected Hα is primarily the
result of star formation, Constantin et al. (2008) showed
the prevalence of AGN in void galaxies is similar to that

MNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)

of denser wall regions. We therefore check if any of the Hα
emission in our galaxies is the result of AGN activity. In Fig-
ure 10 we present Baldwin, Phillips & Trelivich (BPT; Bald-
win et al. 1981) diagrams and in Figure 11 we present WHα
versus [NII]/Hα (WHAN; Cid Fernandes et al. 2011) emis-
sion line diagnostic diagrams as a function of distance from
the galaxy centre. Every point on each diagram corresponds
to a Voronoi bin with emission of the relevant lines. Distance
to galaxy centre is measured from the ﬂux-weighted centre
of the Voronoi bin. The BPT diagrams show most regions
of most galaxies residing in either the AGN or AGN+SF re-
gions, though the outer Voronoi bins will suﬀer from either
low S:N, or despite being located in the AGN regions, will be
retired (‘fake AGN’; Cid Fernandes et al. 2011). CGCG019-

is ∼0.05. It is therefore feasible that there are two galaxies
hosting AGN in our sample of nine.

When used in conjunction with a BPT diagram, a
WHAN diagram can separate regions of AGN activity from
retired regions of a galaxy with similar [NII]/Hα. Indeed,
the central regions of a galaxy located in the AGN region
of a BPT diagram should only be classiﬁed as a bone ﬁde
AGN if they also lie in the AGN region of a WHAN diagram.
We see that for the majority of our galaxies, this is not the
case. Of the galaxies with high S:N in Figure 11, we see ﬁve
follow a tight correlation through the star forming region
for the outer bins, and into the passive/retired region for
the central bins. CGCG 013-075 extends signiﬁcantly into
the AGN region of the WHAN diagram, so we classify it as
an AGN. While CGCG 019-064 does not have points in the
AGN region of this diagram, given other evidence such as
high concentrations of Hα and [OIII] in the central regions,
we still assume AGN activity, despite the narrow Hα equiv-
alent widths. None of our nine galaxies satisfy the mid-IR
strong AGN selection criteria of Jarrett et al. (2011). This,
along with a lack of emission line broadening of the spec-
tra lead us to believe these are Seyfert galaxies. Constantin
et al. (2008) show that for the median mass of our sample
(∼ 1010.5M(cid:12)), the fraction of weak AGN expected in void
regions is approximately 0.07, while the strong AGN fraction

7 COMPARISON TO A SAMPLE OF ‘FIELD’

GALAXIES

We have concluded that despite having predominantly sec-
ular evolution histories and similarly low SFRs, our void
galaxy sample must still possess a wide range of assembly
histories from their kinematics and AGN fraction. We seek
to discover how these attributes compare against a sam-
ple of galaxies in the wider galaxy population. We com-
pare the properties of our void galaxy sample to that of a
mass, magnitude and redshift-matched sample of ﬁeld galax-
ies, drawn from the SAMI galaxy survey early data release
(EDR; Croom et al. 2012; Allen et al. 2015; Bryant et al.
2015; Sharp et al. 2015).

7.1 Field Galaxy Sample

A comparison sample of ﬁeld galaxies taken from all envi-
ronments was created from the SAMI galaxy survey EDR by
matching to the constraints used to select our void galaxy
targets. All galaxies with stellar mass > 1010M(cid:12), redshift

S:N threshold. If nebular emission lines are not detected by the pPXF ﬁt for a region, the gas velocity is not measured, as is the case for
some central regions of IC 0566 and CGCG 010-071. For the majority of galaxies the gas and stellar velocities match well, though the
central region of CGCG 010-071 is disturbed. The gas of IC 0566 does not match the stellar velocity map, leading us to conclude this
galaxy has experienced an event to disrupt the gas, such as a merger.

Figure 9. Normalised Hα ﬂux maps for all central regions of the galaxies in our sample. White regions correspond to where the pPXF
ﬁt didn’t pick up any Hα emission. The black contours overlaid are total integrated ﬂux. The majority of our sample possess discs of
younger stellar population with old stars in their nuclear region. The exception is CGCG 019-064, which has the majority of its Hα
emission in its core. This is due either to star formation or AGN emission.

< 0.052 and r-band apparent magnitude < 15.7 were in-
cluded in the sample. This selection ensures the galaxies we
are comparing to are similarly massive. Of the 107 galaxies
in the SAMI EDR, nine ﬁt these criteria, the properties of
which are described in Table 2, with SDSS colour images in
Figure 12. Despite the identical selection method, these nine
galaxies are bluer than the void sample, spread throughout
the star forming main sequence and quiescent regions. On
a u − r colour magnitude diagram using SDSS photometry,
four galaxies lie on the red sequence, four in the green val-
ley, and one in the blue cloud. Their mid-IR colours show
a slightly higher excess of W 3 than the void sample of this
work. We check that these ﬁeld galaxies are in suﬃciently
denser regions of the cosmic web than our void galaxies by
determining the distance to the ﬁfth nearest neighbour (d5)
and the environmental density (σ5) of the ﬁeld sample to
compare to the void sample. We use the SDSS DR7 sample
with an absolute magnitude cut of MR > −20 to determine
d5 and σ5 following the method described in Baldry et al.

(2006). Our ﬁeld galaxies have a median d5 = 1.8 Mpc and
σ5 = 0.504 Mpc−2, compared to 4.8 Mpc and 0.069 Mpc−2
for void regions respectively. Baldry et al. (2006) states that
void regions should have σ5 as low as 0.05 Mpc−2, increas-
ing to 20 Mpc−2 for cluster regions for SDSS DR4. We are
therefore satisﬁed our sample galaxies are located in bona
ﬁde void regions, and are suﬃciently more underdense then
the comparison ﬁeld galaxies.

At masses > 1010 M(cid:12), mass quenching plays an in-
creasingly important role in galaxy evolution (e.g., Geha
et al. 2012), hence we choose to match our void and ﬁeld
sample based on mass rather than environment. Because of
this, there may be some secondary environmental eﬀects, for
example those caused by nearby neighbours, but with our
small sample, we cannot investigate this in detail. Instead,
we seek to gain a representative idea of the global properties
of isolated void galaxies as compared to the rest of the Uni-
verse. We compare these galaxies to our original void galaxy
sample in the following sections.

7.2 Morphology & Star Formation Rates

The SDSS colour images of the nine SAMI ﬁeld galaxies are
shown in Figure 12. These galaxies all appear discy, with a
mix of spiral and lenticular morphologies. This is a similar
spread to the void galaxy sample.

We present the Hα-derived cumulative star formation
rates as a function of radius in Figure 13, calculated in the
same manor as for the void galaxies using Equation 1, but
without the need for Voronoi binning of ﬂux due to the su-
perior S:N of the SAMI data. Also included as star-shaped
points of the same colour are WISE integrated SFRs for
each galaxy when available. While we would expect from
prior literature that void galaxies would be on average more
star forming than ﬁeld galaxies, we ﬁnd this is not the case.
The low S:N of the outer regions of the void galaxies may be
contributing to this low SFR however. On average, the SAMI

MNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)

ﬁeld galaxies posses SFRs greater than that of the void sam-
ple. This is not unexpected, as the ﬁeld galaxies had on av-
erage a greater excess of mid-IR W3 emission. If we instead
compare WISE SFRs, these galaxies have more comparable
SFRs. The highest SFR belongs to a void galaxy, though
on average ﬁeld galaxies still have slightly higher SFRs than
void galaxies. We also note that while there are examples
of ﬁeld galaxies with high SFRs and close companions (as
seen in Table 2), we cannot conclude that star formation
is enhanced by the companions, as we also see examples of
high star formation in isolated galaxies. While it is diﬃcult
to separate the contribution of large-scale environmental ef-
fects and small-scale neighbour eﬀects on star formation, the
fact that both high and low star forming galaxies are seen
in all environments in the ﬁeld sample leads us to believe
that neither are having a signiﬁcant eﬀect on our small ﬁeld
sample.

Though our samples of both void and ﬁeld galaxies are

Figure 11. WHAN diagrams for the sample as a function of distance from galaxy centre. Dividing lines are plotted as per Cid Fernandes
et al. (2011) to delineate between star forming, passive/ retired and strong and weak AGN regions. Five of the galaxies with high S:N
show a tight correlation between log([NII]/Hα) and log(WHα), though only CGCG 013-075 has central points in the AGN region. For
this reason, we classify this galaxy as an AGN.

not large enough to comment statistically on the average
SFRs of each environment, we see no evidence for an en-
hancement of star formation in void galaxies for this mass
range. Since these galaxies are mass-matched, we infer that
their relative environments have little eﬀect on star forma-
tion, instead quenching is occurring based on the galaxy’s
mass.

8 CONCLUSIONS

To investigate the assembly histories of void galaxies, we
took IFS observations of a sample of nine massive (M(cid:63) >
1010M(cid:12)) central and isolated void galaxies. While gas and
stellar kinematics revealed seven of our nine galaxies are

regularly rotating as disc galaxies, the remaining two posses
gas kinematics consistent with a galaxy that has either un-
dergone a recent merger or gas mixing due to the pres-
ence of a galactic bar. Visual morphologies conﬁrm these
two diagnoses, and verify the rest of the sample are indeed
secularly-evolving disc galaxies. Two of our galaxies are lo-
cated on BPT and WHAN diagnostic diagrams consistent
with AGN activity. This range of galaxy properties for a
sample of galaxies of similar mass and environment con-
ﬁrms the results of Penny et al. (2015) that there must be
many assembly histories present in void galaxies, and high-
lights the interactions still occurring in voids (e.g., Kreckel
et al. 2012). Despite the mix of internal processes occurring
in these galaxies, all have uniformly low star formation rates
of < 1M(cid:12) yr−1 from the central regions of integrated Hα-

derived SFRs, or < 3.3 M(cid:12) yr−1 using the WISE mid-IR
photometric relation of Cluver et al. (2014).

We compared our void galaxy sample to that of a mass,
magnitude and redshift-matched sample of ﬁeld galaxies
from the SAMI EDR. We ﬁnd similarly low SFRs for both
samples, and no evidence of an enhancement of SFR due
to the relative isolation of the void sample. Indeed, some
of our void galaxies have lower SFRs than the ﬁeld sample.
We are led to conclude that the environmental position of
these galaxies is not aﬀecting their SFRs, and that mass-
quenching is the dominant mode of star formation cessation
in galaxies of this mass range.

APPENDIX A: NOTES ON INDIVIDUAL VOID
GALAXIES OBSERVED

We discuss each galaxy observed for this work in detail.

A1 IC 0566

This galaxy has an obvious merger remnant in the tidal tail
located in the South West corner. It is classiﬁed as lenticular
by Nair & Abraham (2010). The negligible Hα emission at
the centre of the galaxy coupled with a low star formation
rate of 0.03 M(cid:12) yr−1 implies the recent merger was dry.

Figure 13. Cumulative Hα-derived star formation rates for the nine galaxies in the void galaxy sample and the SAMI comparison
sample (coloured lines) and WISE W 3 total integrated SFRs (stars) where available . All integrated star formation rates are calculated
to be < 1M(cid:12) yr−1 for the void galaxy sample, and < 3M(cid:12) yr−1 for the SAMI sample, truncated at 3 × expRadr where required.
While on average, the ﬁeld galaxy integrated SFRs are higher, ﬂux calibration issues and disc regions missed due to low S:N of the void
galaxy sample should be taken into account. The two galaxies with the highest discrepancies between Hα and WISE W 3 SFRs were
only observed out to 1 and 1.5 expRadr. The superior S:N of the SAMI galaxies means they are often measured out past 2 expRadr.
When instead the WISE 12µm SFRs are compared, both samples have a very similar spread in SFR, leading us to conclude there is no
signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the void and ﬁeld sample SFRs..

Gas kinematics show that the galaxy has not yet virialised
after this merger, though the regular rotation of the stellar
component suggests this was a minor merger. While it seems
this galaxy is not evolving in isolation, the stellar rotation
curve implies until recently, this galaxy was discy.

A2 CGCG 010-071

Nair & Abraham (2010) classify this galaxy as an edge-on,
barred Sa galaxy with a T-type of 1. The stellar velocity map
shows regular rotation, and while the gas is still rotating in
the same general direction, it is disturbed slightly in the cen-
tral region, likely by the bar structure. Balmer and forbidden
emission line ratio maps show a higher fraction of line emis-
sion in the disc region, with lower levels in the central bulge
region. The low star formation rate of 0.24 M(cid:12) yr−1 lead us
to classify this galaxy as a secularly-evolving red spiral.

A3 GAMA 214363

This galaxy has no published classiﬁcations, but using Sloan
imaging we classify this galaxy as lenticular. Hα and other
emission lines have little to no emission in the central region
of the galaxy. Gas and stellar kinematics line up well for
this galaxy, and along with its low SFR and disc nature, we
again classify it as a secularly-evolving disc galaxy.

A4 GAMA 534760

At z=0.052, this galaxy is the highest redshift galaxy in
our sample. Fukugita et al. (2007) classify this galaxy as
lenticular. Line emission is concentrated in the outer regions
of the galaxy, and regular rotation lines up both the gas and
stellar kinematics. Given the slightly higher redshift, but

similar stellar mass of this galaxy, it seems to be comparably
more evolved compared to its discy counterparts.

A5 CGCG 013-075

This galaxy is a face-on, disc-dominated, barred spiral
galaxy. This galaxy possesses blue spiral arms, and the SFR
is low in the inner regions, then increases out past an ex-
ponential radius, highlighting the importance of studying a
galaxy out past its eﬀective radius. Stellar and gas kinemat-
ics match up well, indicating no recent merger activity. BPT
and WHAN diagrams both agree that this galaxy is likely to
be hosting an AGN. This, coupled with the moderate SFR
means this is the most active galaxy in our void sample. It is
possible the star formation in the spiral arms is being fuelled
by infalling gas perhaps from a ﬁlament or tendril extending
into the void.

A6 CGCG019-064

This is the only galaxy with a higher relative Hα concentra-
tion in the core region than the outskirts. The emission line
ﬂux maps follow that of the Hα map, showing a higher con-
centration of every emission line besides Hγ in the central
regions of the galaxy, unlike the rest of our sample. The high
[OIII] concentration in the centre is indicative of AGN activ-
ity, and while the BPT diagram reinforces this, the WHAN
diagram places the galaxy in the retired region by virtue of
the small Hα EWs. Despite this, we expect this galaxy to
posses a (likely weak) AGN.

This galaxy is another archetypal example of a discy void
galaxy. This galaxy comprises a red bulge region, with an
outer disc of younger stellar population. NASA Sloan At-
las1 r-band Sersic ﬁt residuals show a ring surrounding the
nucleus, possibly the result of a minor merger. The Sersic
number is 3.9 and we classify this galaxy as a lenticular.
The stellar and gas kinematics match up well as shown in
Figure 6, indicating no recent mergers. The characteristic
emission line ratios for Balmer lines, [NII] and [OIII] show
low levels of emission in the centre, and higher rings of emis-
sion surrounding, all reminiscent of a galaxy with a red and
passive centre, but a younger, more active outer region. The
symmetry of the emission line ring surrounding the nucleus
suggests infalling gas as the mechanism for star formation.

A8 IC 0653

This galaxy has the largest angular size in our sample, so
we probe the inner regions in extreme detail, out to half
an exponential ﬁt radius. The morphology of this galaxy is
again a red spiral, with an inclined axis ratio. The emis-
sion line maps have the best S:N of our sample and again
show less emission in the central regions compared to the
outskirts. We measure a SFR of 0.26 M(cid:12) yr−1, which would
likely be higher and closer to the WISE mid-IR value if we
had probed out further into the disc regions of the galaxy. A
WHAN diagram conﬁrms the central regions of the galaxy
are passive, with more star forming regions being located
towards the outskirts of the disc. Gas and stellar kinemat-
ics match up very well, implying no recent mergers. This,
coupled with the visible spiral arms and lack of star forma-
tion, lead us to classify this galaxy as a red spiral, secularly
evolving in isolation.

A9 CGCG 017-063

This galaxy is a face-on spiral galaxy with properties typical
of the rest of the void galaxy population. Emission line maps
show lower levels of Hα emission in the central regions of
the galaxy compared to the outer disc. This is true also for
the other Balmer lines, [OIII] and [NII]. A BPT diagram
places the central spaxels in the AGN+SF region and the
outer regions in the purely star forming region We deduce
the likelihood of AGN activity is low in this galaxy. This is
conﬁrmed by the WHAN diagram, which places the central
regions of the galaxy in the passive/retired region, with the
outskirts again into the star forming region. We observe this
galaxy out to 5 exponential ﬁt radii, with a total integrated
Hα SFR of 0.70 M(cid:12) yr−1. We conclude this galaxy is an
anaemic red spiral.

GAMA is a joint European-Australasian project based
around a spectroscopic
campaign using the Anglo-
Australian Telescope. The GAMA input catalogue is based
on data taken from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the
UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey. Complementary imaging
of the GAMA regions is being obtained by a number of in-
dependent survey programmes including GALEX MIS, VST
KiDS, VISTA VIKING, WISE, Herschel-ATLAS, GMRT
and ASKAP providing UV to radio coverage. GAMA is
funded by the STFC (UK), the ARC (Australia), the AAO,
and the participating institutions. The GAMA website is
http://www.gama-survey.org/.
The SAMI Galaxy Survey is based on observations made at
the Anglo-Australian Telescope. The Sydney-AAO Multi-
object Integral ﬁeld spectrograph (SAMI) was developed
jointly by the University of Sydney and the Australian As-
tronomical Observatory. The SAMI input catalogue is based
on data taken from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the GAMA
Survey and the VST ATLAS Survey. The SAMI Galaxy Sur-
vey is funded by the Australian Research Council Centre of
Excellence for All-sky Astrophysics (CAASTRO), through
project number CE110001020, and other participating insti-
tutions. The SAMI Galaxy Survey website is http://sami-
survey.org/.
Funding for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV has been pro-
vided by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, the U.S. Depart-
ment of Energy Oﬃce of Science, and the Participating Insti-
tutions. SDSS-IV acknowledges support and resources from
the Center for High-Performance Computing at the Univer-
sity of Utah. The SDSS web site is www.sdss.org.
