Abstract

The distinguishing number (index) D(G) (D′(G)) of a graph G is the least
integer d such that G has an vertex labeling (edge labeling) with d labels that is
preserved only by a trivial automorphism. In this paper we study the distinguishing
number and the distinguishing index of join of two graphs G and H, i.e., G + H.
We prove that 0 ≤ D(G + H) − max{D(G), D(H)} ≤ z, where z is dependent on
the number of some induced subgraphs generated by some suitable partitions of
V (G) and V (H). Also we obtain two upper bounds for D′(G + H).

Keywords: Distinguishing index; Distinguishing number; join.

Introduction

Let G = (V, E) be a graph with n vertices. We use the standard graph notation
([5]).
In particular, Aut(G) denotes the automorphism group of G. A labeling of
G, φ : V → {1, 2, . . . , r}, is r-distinguishing, if no non-trivial automorphism of G
preserves all of the vertex labels. Formally, φ is r-distinguishing if for every non-
trivial σ ∈ Aut(G), there exists x in V such that φ(x) 6= φ(xσ). The distinguishing
number of a graph G is the minimum number r such that G has a labeling that is
r-distinguishing. This number has deﬁned by Albertson and Collins [2]. Similar to this
deﬁnition, Kalinkowski and Pil´sniak [7] have deﬁned the distinguishing index D′(G)
of G which is the least integer d such that G has an edge colouring with d colours
that is preserved only by a trivial automorphism. Observe that D(G) = 1 for the
asymmetric graphs G and D(G) = |V (G)|, if and only if G = Kn. It is immediate
that D(Pn) = 2 for n ≥ 2, where Pn is the n-vertex path. A classical result gives
that for the cycle with n vertices, Cn, D(Cn) = 3 if n = 3, 4, 5 and D(Cn) = 2 for

n ≥ 6. Also for complete bipartite graph when q > p, D(Kp,q) = q, D(Kn,n) = n + 1
for n ≥ 3, for the n-cube Qn, D(Qn) = 2, for n ≥ 4 and D(Qn) = 3 for n = 2, 3 ([4]).
The distinguishing index of some graphs was exhibited in [3, 7]. The distinguishing
number and index of the Cartesian product and the Cartesian powers of graphs has
been thoroughly investigated ([1, 8, 9]). Pil´sniak studied the Nordhaus-Gaddum bounds
for the distinguishing index in [10]. Also the distinguishing number of the hypercube has
investigated in [4]. Recently, we studied the distinguishing number and distinguishing
index of corona product of two graphs ([3]).

We say that G is a join graph if G is the complete union of two graphs G1 = (V1, E1)
and G2 = (V2, E2). In other words, V = V1∪V2 and E = E1∪E2∪{uv|u ∈ V1, v ∈ V2}. If
G is the join graph of G1 and G2, we write G = G1 +G2. For simple connected graph G,
and v ∈ V , the neighborhood of v is the set NG(v) = N (v) = {u ∈ V (G) : uv ∈ E(G)}.
The nonadjacent vertices to v in G is V (G) \ N (v) and denoted by N (v). A subgraph
H of G is an induced subgraph if two vertices of V (H) are adjacent in H if and only if
they are adjacent in G. As usual we denote the induced subgraph by a set X ⊆ V , by
G[X].
In the next section, we study the distinguishing number of join of two graphs. In
Section 3, we present two upper bounds for the distinguishing index of the join of two
graphs and show that they are sharp.

2 The distinguishing number of the join of two graphs

In this section, we study the distinguishing number of join of two graphs. We begin
with the following theorem which gives a lower bound for the distinguishing number of
join of two graphs:

Theorem 2.1 Let G1 and G2 be two connected graphs. Then

D(G1 + G2) > max{D(G1), D(G2)}.

Proof. Let fi ∈ Aut(Gi) (i = 1, 2). The following maps are the automorphisms of
G1 + G2.

(cid:26) h : V (G1 + G2) → V (G1 + G2)

v 7→ fi(v) If v ∈ Gi.

Since we are looking for the labeling that does not preserve the labeling, we label both
of G1 and G2 in distinguishing way and so, we have the result.
(cid:3)

The lower bound in Theorem 2.1 is sharp. Because for every natural number n, m,

D(Kn) = D(Km) = 2 and D(Kn + Km) = D(Kn+m) = 2.

To obtain an upper bound for the distinguishing number of the join of two arbitrary
graphs G1 and G2, we partition the vertices of G1 + G2 such that every automorphism
of G1 + G2 maps the classes to each other. This partition is as follows:

Let G1 and G2 be two graphs and G = G1 + G2. Let v1 be an arbitrary vertex of
G1. First put A1 = NG(v1) (note that NG(v1) ⊆ V (G1)). We add all nonadjacent sets

2

of the vertices of G (say v) such that their nonadjacent sets satisfy NG(v) ∩ A1 6= ∅, to
A1 and denote again the new set by A1 (if v ∈ G and NG(v) ∩ A1 6= ∅ then v ∈ G1).
We continue this process until there is no a vertex in G with this property.
Let v2 be a vertex of G1 such that v2 /∈ A1. Put A2 = NG(v2) and similar to
construction of A1, add suitable nonadjacent sets of a vertex to A2 and repeat this
action. It is clear that after a ﬁnite number of steps, the vertices of G1 partition to
Ai’s. With similar argument we suppose that the vertices of G2 partition to some sets,
say, Bj’s. Without loss of generality we assume that the vertices of G are partitioned
into k + k′ equivalence classes as follows (the notation v is used for the vertices of G1
and the notation w is used for the vertices of G2):

A1 = NG(v1) ∪ ··· ∪ NG(vt1 ),
A2 = NG(vt1+1) ∪ ··· ∪ NG(vt1+t2),
...
Ak = NG(vt1+...+tk−1+1) ∪ ··· ∪ NG(vt1+...+tk ),
B1 = NG(w1) ∪ ··· ∪ NG(wt′
B2 = NG(wt′
...
Bk′ = NG(wt′

Lemma 2.2 Let G1 and G2 be two graphs and G = G1 + G2. Suppose that A =
{A1, . . . , Ak} and B = {B1, . . . , Bk′} are two partitions of the vertices G1 and G2 as
stated in (1), respectively. If f is an automorphism of G, then f is a permutation on
the set A ∪ B.
1 ∈ V (G) and f (u1) = u′
Proof. Let u1, u′
f (NG(u1)) = NG(u′
1, u′

1) and f (NG(u2)) = NG(u′

Let u1, u2, u′

2 ∈ V (G), f (NG(u1)) = NG(u′
NG(u1) ∩ NG(u2) 6= ∅ ⇔ NG(u′

2) 6= ∅.

we have

Now by induction, if u1, . . . , us, u′

1, . . . , u′

s ∈ V (G) and f (NG(ui)) = NG(u′

i) where

1 6 i 6 s then we have

(cid:16)NG(u1) ∪ . . . ∪ NG(us)(cid:17) ∩ NG(us) 6= ∅ ⇔ (cid:16)NG(u′
s) 6= ∅.
By the above illustrations and deﬁnitions of Ai and Bj with 1 6 i 6 k and 1 6 j 6 k′
(cid:3)

1) ∪ . . . ∪ NG(u′

s)(cid:17) ∩ NG(u′

we can conclude that f is a permutation on A ∪ B.

Corollary 2.3 Let G1 and G2 be two graphs and G = G1 + G2. Suppose that A =
{A1, . . . , Ak} and B = {B1, . . . , Bk′} are two partitions of the vertices G1 and G2 as

3

stated in (1), respectively and put A ∪ B = C = {C1, . . . , Ck+k′}. If f is an automor-
phism of G and f (Ci) = Cj, for some i, j ∈ {1, . . . , k + k′}, then induced subgraphs
G[Ci] and G[Cj] are isomorphic.

Before stating and proving the main theorems we need some additional information
about G1 and G2. Let G1 and G2 be two graphs and G = G1 + G2 such that A =
{A1, . . . , Ak} and B = {B1, . . . , Bk′} are two partitions of the vertices G1 and G2,
respectively. Put H = (cid:8)G[A1], . . . , G[Ak](cid:9) and H ′ = (cid:8)G[B1], . . . , G[Bk′](cid:9). Some of the
induced subgraphs in each H and H ′ are isomorphic. Let to put all isomorphic induced
subgraphs of H and H ′ in some sets and denote them by Ai and Bj, respectively. In
fact, we partition the two sets H, H ′ into t, t′ disjoint sets A1, . . . ,At and B1, . . . ,Bt′
such that |Ai| = ni and |Bj| = mj with ni, mj > 1, 1 6 i 6 t and 1 6 j 6 t′ as follows:

A1 = (cid:8)G[A1], . . . , G[An1 ](cid:9),
A2 = (cid:8)G[An1+1], . . . , G[An1+n2](cid:9),
...
At = (cid:8)G[An1+...+nt−1+1], . . . , G[An1+...+nt](cid:9),
B1 = (cid:8)G[B1], . . . , G[Bm1 ](cid:9),
B2 = (cid:8)G[Bm1+1], . . . , G[Bm1+m2](cid:9),
...
Bt′ = (cid:8)G[Bm1+...+mt′

−1+1], . . . , G[Bm1+...+mt′ ](cid:9).

(2)

It is possible that some of the elements in Ai are isomorphic to some elements in a Bj,
where 1 6 i 6 t and 1 6 j 6 t′ (note that if an element of Ai is isomorphic to an
element of Bj then all elements of Ai have this property). Let q be the number of Ai
for which there exist some Bj that Ai ∼= Bj. Then we can partition the set H ∪ H ′
into disjoint sets Γ1, . . . , Γt+t′−q as follows: (we use new notation for vertices of G, if
necessary).




1 6 i 6 q,
1 6 i 6 t − q,
1 6 i 6 t′ − q,

Γi = Ai ∪ Bi
Γq+i = Aq+i
Γt+i = Bt+i
where 0 6 q 6 min{t, t′} (See Figure 1).
Remark 2.4 Using the partition of H ∪ H ′ in (3), Lemma 2.2 and Corollary 2.3 we
can conclude that if f ∈ Aut(G1 + G2) then f|Γi ∈ Aut(Γi) for 1 6 i 6 q where
0 6 q 6 min{t, t′}.

(3)

Now we are ready to state and prove the main result on the distinguishing number

of the join of two graphs:

Theorem 2.5 Let G1 and G2 be two non-isomorphic graphs and G = G1 + G2.

4

Figure 1: The partition of G1 + G2.

(i) If q = 0 then D(G1 + G2) = max{D(G1), D(G2)}.
(ii) If q 6= 0 and z = min(cid:8)max{n1, . . . , nq}, max{m1, . . . , mq}(cid:9) then

D(G1 + G2) 6 max{D(G1), D(G2)} + z.

Proof.

(i) If q = 0 then none of the elements of H are isomorphic to an element of H ′. By
Corollary 2.3, if f ∈ Aut(G) then f|G1 ∈ Aut(G1) and f|G2 ∈ Aut(G2), and so
we have the result.

(ii) Let d = max{D(G1), D(G2)}. We shall present a distinguishing labeling with
d + z labels. Without loss of generality we can assume that z = m1, and so
B1 = {G[B1], . . . , G[Bm1 ]}.
First, we label both G1 and G2 with D(G1) and D(G2) labels in distinguishing
way, respectively. Now to obtain a distinguishing labeling of G1 + G2, we change
the labels of the vertices G2 as follows:

• We change the label of an arbitrary vertex of G[Bi] to d + i, for every

1 6 i 6 m1.

5

We do similar above process on B2, . . . ,Bt′ (note that if z = nik for some k ∈
{1, . . . , q} then we should do the similar work on G1). By Lemma 2.2, Corollary
2.3 and the distinguishing labeling in both G1 and G2, we can conclude that
presented labeling is distinguishing. Since we used max{D(G1), D(G2)}+z labels,
the inequality follows.

(cid:3)

Remark 2.6 The value of z in Theorem 2.5 (ii) can be zero or suﬃciently large,
depending on the structures of graphs G1 and G2. As an example, consider the complete
k-partite graph Kd,...,d as G1 and G2 and G = Kd,...,d + Kd,...,d, then using notations in
(2), Ai = Bi = ∅ for 2 6 i 6 t, and A1 = B1 = {G[A1], . . . , G[Ak]}, where Ai is the
i-th part of Kd,...,d. Therefore z = k and so, z can be suﬃciently large.

Now we shall show that the inequality in Theorem 2.5 (ii) is sharp.

Corollary 2.7 Let n > m, n > m′ and m 6= m′. The distinguishing number of Kn,m +
Kn,m′ is n + 1.
Proof. Let X = {v1, . . . , vn}, Y = {w1, . . . , wm} be two parts of Kn,m, and X ′ =
{v′
m′} be two parts of Kn,m′. Suppose that G = Kn,m +
Kn,m′. Using the partition in (1) we can write:

n}, Y ′ = {w′

1, . . . , w′

1, . . . , v′

A1 = NG(v1) = {v1, . . . , vn}, A2 = NG(w1) = {w1, . . . , wm}.

Since the number of elements in A1 and A2 are distinct, G[A1] ≇ G[A2]. Then by the
partition in (2) we have A1 = {G[A1]} and A2 = {G[A2]} and so n1 = n2 = 1. Now by
similar argument we can write:

B1 = NG(v′

1) = {v′

1, . . . , v′

n}, B2 = NG(w′

1) = {w′

1, . . . , w′

m′}.

Then B1 = {G[B1]} and B2 = {G[B2]} and so m1 = m2 = 1. Since the induced
subgraphs have no edges, G[A1] ∼= G[B1]. With respect to the partition in (3) we have

Γ1 = A1 ∪ B1 = {G[A1], G[B1]}, Γ2 = A2 = {G[A2]}, Γ3 = B2 = {G[B2]}.

It is clear that for every labeling by n labels we can ﬁnd an automorphism of Γ1 such
that it preserves the labeling. So we can ﬁnd an automorphism of G with this property.
Consider the following labeling by n + 1 labels:

We assign the vertices in A1 the labels 1, . . . , n and the vertices in B1 the labels
1, . . . , n − 1, n + 1. We label the vertices in A2 by the labels 1, . . . , m and the vertices
in B2 by the labels 1, . . . , m′. By Remark 2.4, this labeling is distinguishing, and so
D(Kn,m + Kn,m′) = n + 1.
(cid:3)

Theorem 2.8 Let n1, ..., nt be the number of elements of classes stated in (2). We
have

D(G) 6 D(G + G) 6 D(G) + max{n1, . . . , nt}.

6

Proof. Let G1 and G2 be two isomorphic graphs and denote both of them by G,
then the left side inequality is identiﬁed by Theorem 2.1. To prove the right side of
inequality, we present a distinguishing labeling as follows:

Without loss of generality we can assume that n1 = max{n1, . . . , nt}. First, we
label G and its copy with D(G) labels in distinguishing way. To obtain a distinguishing
labeling for G + G we change the labels of the vertices of G as follows:

• We change the label of an arbitrary vertex of (G + G)[Ai] to D(G) + i, for every

1 6 i 6 n1.

So the label of vertices of A1 was changed. We do similar above process on A2, . . . ,At.
By Lemma 2.2, Corollary 2.3 and the distinguishing labeling in both G and its copy,
we can conclude that presented labeling is distinguishing. Since we used D(G) +
max{n1, . . . , nt} labels, the right side inequality follows.
(cid:3)
Remark 2.9 With similar argument in Corollary 2.7 we can show that the inequality
in Theorem 2.8 is sharp for the star graphs K1,n. In fact D(K1,n + K1,n) = n + 1 where
D(K1,n) = n and max{n1, . . . , nt} = 1.

3 Distinguishing index of the join of two graphs

In this section we study the distinguishing index for the join of two graphs. To obtain
an upper bound for D′(G1 + G2) we consider (3) which is a partition of H ∪ H ′, i.e.,
Γ1, . . . , Γt+t′−q. Note that the elements of Ai are isomorphic to elements of Bi for
1 6 i 6 q where 0 6 q 6 min{t, t′}. If G1 ∼= G2 then t = t′ and the elements of Ai are
isomorphic to elements of Bi for 1 6 i 6 t.
Let Ei be the set of edges of G1 + G2 such that the end points of its edges are in Γi
for 1 6 i 6 t + t′ − q. We add the set Ei to the set of edges Γi and denote the obtained
new graph by Γ′
i. The following result gives an upper bound for D′(G1 + G2) based on
the distinguishing index of Γ′
i.

Theorem 3.1 Let G1 and G2 be two graphs such that G1 + G2 has been partitioned to
the set of induced subgraphs Γ1, . . . , Γt+t′−q as (3). Then

D′(G1 + G2) 6 max{D′(Γ′

1), . . . , D′(Γ′

t+t′−q)}.

Proof. We label the edges of the graph Γ′
i (1 6 i 6 t + t′ − q) by D′(Γ′
i) labels in
distinguishing way. We assign the remaining edges the label 1. By Remark 2.4, this
labeling is distinguishing. The number of labels that have been used here is

max{D′(Γ′

1), . . . , D′(Γ′

t+t′−q)}.

So we have the result.

(cid:3)
Now, we like to present another upper bound for D′(G1 + G2). For this purpose we

state some preliminaries.

Let Xi, i ∈ I (I is the index set) be the set of complete bipartite graphs K|V (Γs)|,|V (Γs′ )|

such that satisfy the two following conditions:

7

• The two parts of each elements of Xi should be distinct.
• The set of all parts that have been used as parts of elements of Xi should be

{V (Γ1), . . . , V (Γt+t′−q)}.

Let εi = max{D′(K|V (Γs)|,|V (Γs′ )|) : K|V (Γs)|,|V (Γs′ )| ∈ Xi}. Then we have following

theorem:

Theorem 3.2 Let G1 and G2 be two graphs such that G1 + G2 has been partitioned to
induced subgraphs Γ1, . . . , Γt+t′−q as (3). Then D′(G1 + G2) 6 min{εi}i∈I .
Proof. We label the edges of each complete bipartite graph in Xi in distinguishing way
(by D′(K|V (Γs)|,|V (Γs′ )|) labels) and assign the remaining edges the label 1. Since all
parts Γ1, . . . , Γt+t′−q have been used in building of the complete bipartite graphs in Xi
and by Remark 2.4, this labeling is distinguishing. Therefore D′(G1+G2) 6 min{εi}i∈I .

(cid:3)

1), . . . , D′(Γ′

Remark 3.3 By setting λ1 = max{D′(Γ′
t+t′−q)} and λ2 = min{εi}i∈I and
by Theorem 3.1 and 3.2 we have D′(G1 + G2) 6 min{λ1, λ2}. This raises the question
“which upper bound is better, λ1 or λ2”? We show that for some graphs the upper
bound λ1 is better than λ2 and for some graphs the situation is diﬀerent. We present
two examples and these examples show also that the upper bounds of the Theorem 3.1
and 3.2 are sharp.

Since the line graph of Kk,n is isomorphic to Cartesian product Kk✷Kn, so Aut(Kk,n)
coincides with Aut(Kk ✷Kn). Therefore the distinguishing index of the complete bi-
partite graphs which is needed in the solution of Example 3.5 can be translated to
distinguishing number of Cartesian product of complete graphs.

Theorem 3.4 [6] Let k, n, d be integers so that d > 2 and (d − 1)k < n 6 dk. Then

D(Kk✷Kn) = (cid:26) d

If n 6 dk − ⌈logdk⌉ − 1,
d + 1 If n > dk − ⌈logdk⌉ + 1.

If n = dk−⌈logdk⌉ then D(Kk✷Kn) is either d or d+1 and can be computed recursively
in O(log∗(n)) time.

Example 3.5 The upper bound in Theorem 3.1 is better than the upper bound in The-
orem 3.2 for the D′(Pn + Pm) with n, m > 2 and n 6= m.
Solution. Set G = Pn + Pm. Suppose that V (Pn) = {v1, . . . , vn} and V (Pm) =
{w1, . . . , wm}. With these notations we have A1 = NG(v1) = {v1, . . . , vn} and B1 =
NG(w1) = {w1, . . . , wm}. Thus A1 = {G[A1]} and B1 = {G[B1]}. Since n 6= m, so
Γ1 = A1 = {G[A1]}, Γ2 = B1 = {G[B1]} and q = 0. Also, Γ′
2 = Pm.
If we label both Γ′
2 by two labels in distinguishing way (note that D′(Pn) =
D′(Pm) = 2) then we have a distinguishing labeling with two labels by Remark 2.4.

1 = Pn and Γ′

1 and Γ′

8

It is easy to see that D′(Pn + Pm) = λ1 = 2, and so the inequality of Theorem 3.1
is sharp. On the other hand, using the notation of Theorem 3.2 we have I = {1}, and
so X1 = {K|V (Γ1)|,|V (Γ2)|}. By Theorem 3.4 it is clear that ε1 = D′(KV (Γ1),V (Γ2)) is
not equal with 2 for all m, n > 2. Therefore the upper bound λ1 is better than λ2 for
D′(Pn + Pm).
(cid:3)

Here we shall present two graphs for which the upper bound in Theorem 3.2 is
better that the upper bound in Theorem 3.1. We recall that the friendship graph Fn is
the join of K1 with nK2. In other words Fn can be constructed by joining n copies of
the cycle graph C3 with a common vertex (see Figure 2). The following theorem give
the distinguishing number and the distinguishing index of the friendship graph Fn.

Theorem 3.6 [3]

(i) The distinguishing number of the friendship graph Fn (n ≥ 2) is

3 + √8n − 7
⌋.
(ii) Let an = 1 + 27n + 3√81n2 + 6n. For every n ≥ 2,

D(Fn) = ⌊

D′(Fn) = ⌈

Example 3.7 The upper bound in Theorem 3.2 is better than the upper bound in The-
orem 3.1 for D′(Fn + Fm), where 2 6 n 6 m.

Solution. Suppose that G = Fn + Fm. The central vertices of Fn and Fm are denoted
by x0 and y0, respectively. Any two adjacent vertices of Fn (except central vertex x0)
are denoted by x2i−1, x2i where i = 1, . . . , n. The corresponding vertices of Fm are
denoted by y2j−1, y2j where j = 1, . . . , m.

By the partition in (1) we can write A1 = NG(x0) = {x0} and A2 = NG(x1) =
{x1, . . . , x2n}. Also B1 = NG(y0) = {y0} and B2 = NG(y1) = {y1, . . . , y2m}. By
the partition in (2), A1 = {G[A1]} and A2 = {G[A2]}, also B1 = {G[B1]} and B2 =
{G[A2]}. Let m 6= n (the case n = m is similar). By (3) and the hypothesis m 6= n we
have Γ1 = A1 ∪ B1 = {G[A1], G[B1]} and Γ2 = A2 = {G[A2]} and Γ3 = B2 = {G[B2]},
and so q = 1. By notation of Theorem 3.2, one of the sets Xi is as follows:

X1 = {K|V (Γ1)|,|V (Γ2)|, K|V (Γ1)|,|V (Γ3)|}.

By Theorem 3.4 we have ε1 = max{D′(K|V (Γ1)|,|V (Γ2)|), D′(K|V (Γ1)|,|V (Γ3)|)} = 2,
On the other hand Γ′

and so ε1 = min{εi}i∈I . Thus λ2 = 2.

1), D′(Γ′
Therefore upper bound λ2 is better than λ1.

i, i ∈ {2, 3} is the union of graphs P2, and so we have
λ1 = max{D′(Γ′

3)} > 2.

2), D′(Γ′

(cid:3)

Now we shall show that D′(Fn + Fm) = 2 and from this we conclude that the

inequality of Theorem 3.2 is sharp.

Theorem 3.8 For every natural number 2 6 n 6 m, D′(Fn + Fm) = 2.

Proof. Suppose that the central vertices of Fn and Fm are denoted by x0 and y0,
respectively. Any two adjacent vertices of Fn (except central vertex x0) are denoted by
x2i−1, x2i for i = 1, . . . , n. The corresponding vertices of Fm are denoted by y2j−1, y2j
for j = 1, . . . , m. We consider two cases:

Case 1) If n 6= m. We assign all edges of Fn and the edges y0y2j−1 the label 1,
the edges y0y2j and the edges y2j−1y2j the label 2, where j = 1, . . . , m. Now for the
labeling of the edges between Fn and Fm, we label the edges x0yj with the label 1 and
the edges xiy0 with the label 2, where i = 1, . . . , n and j = 1, . . . , m. For presenting
label of the remaining edges we use a matrix. Let A be a 2m × 2n matrix such that
ij-th entry is the label of the edge yixj, where 1 6 i 6 2m and 1 6 j 6 2n. So, the
labels of the remaining edges have been shown by matrix A. (note that the labels in
y2j−1-th row are the same with the labels in y2j-th row, for j = 1, . . . , m).

Note that a automorphism maps the two speciﬁc columns such as x2s−1, x2s to a
speciﬁc columns such as x2t−1, x2t (see matrix A). Similar argument is valid for rows.
This labeling is distinguishing. Because, if f is an automorphism that moves a vertex
of Fm, (except y0) such as y2i−1 then f maps it to y2i or to a vertex of base of a triangle
in Fm. If f maps y2i−1 to y2i then the labeling does not preserve, because the label of
both edges of each triangle is diﬀerent in Fm. If f maps y2i−1 to a vertex of base of
a triangle in Fm then f maps y2i to the other vertex of the base of the same triangle.
So, f dose not preserve the labeling (see the matrix A).

If f is an automorphism that maps x0, y0 to each other, then the edges xiy0 are
mapped to x0f (xi), (f (xi) ∈ V (Fn) \ {x0}). With respect to the label of these edges
we get that f dose not preserve the labeling.
If f is an automorphism that moves a vertex of Fn, (except x0) then f dose not

preserve the labeling (see the matrix A).

Case 2) If n = m. In this case all edges have the same label as Case 1, except the

edges which their labels are in the matrix A. The matrix A changes to A′ as shown.

We note that in this case an automorphism maps the two speciﬁc columns such
as x2s−1, x2s to two speciﬁc columns such as x2t−1, x2t or to two speciﬁc rows such as
x2k−1, x2k. Similar argument is valid for rows. Therefore we presented a 2-distinguishing
labeling in the Cases 1 and 2 and so the result follows.
