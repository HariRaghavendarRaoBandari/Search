QUADRATIC BACKWARD STOCHASTIC DIFFERENTIAL

EQUATIONS DRIVEN BY G-BROWNIAN MOTION: DISCRETE

SOLUTIONS AND APPROXIMATION

YING HU, YIQING LIN, AND ABDOULAYE SOUMANA HIMA

Abstract. In this paper, we consider backward stochastic diﬀerential equations driven
by G-Brownian motion (GBSDEs) under quadratic assumptions on coeﬃcients. We prove
the existence and uniqueness of solution for such equations. On the one hand, a priori
estimates are obtained by applying the Girsanov type theorem in the G-framework, from
which we deduce the uniqueness. On the other hand, to prove the existence of solutions,
we ﬁrst construct solutions for discrete GBSDEs by solving corresponding fully nonlinear
PDEs, and then approximate solutions for general quadratic GBSDEs in Banach spaces.

1. Introduction

The ﬁrst existence and uniqueness result for nonlinear backward stochastic diﬀerential
equations (BSDEs for short) of the following form is provided by Pardoux and Peng in
[25]:

where the generator f is uniformly Lipschitz and the terminal value ξ is square integrable.
Since then, BSDEs have been studied with great interest and moreover, these equations
are found to have strong connections with diﬀerent mathematical ﬁelds, such as mathe-
matical ﬁnance, stochastic control and partial diﬀerential equations. In particular, many
eﬀorts have been made to relax the assumption on the generator. For instance, Kobylanski
[17] was the ﬁrst to investigate the BSDE with a generator having quadratic growth in Z
and a bounded terminal value. She used an exponential transformation in order to come
back to the framework of linear growth generator. This seminal work of quadratic BSDE
has been extended by many authors. Since a complete review of these literatures is too
extensive, we only concentrate on those of immediate interest. For the existence, Briand
and Hu [6] observed that the existence of exponential moments of the terminal condition
is suﬃcient to construct a solution of quadratic BSDEs; uniqueness is proved in [7] under
the additional assumption that the generator is convex (or concave). On the other hand,
Hu et al. discovered in [14] that for certain type of f locally Lipschitz in Z, if the solution

Y is bounded, the solution Z is bounded in BMO norm, and thus the uniqueness could
be proved by applying linearization of the generator. Afterwards, Tevzadze improved the
methodology of [14] and he gave a direct proof in [41] for the solvability of quadratic BS-
DEs by standard ﬁxed point arguments, whereas the terminal value was assumed to be
suﬃcient small. To get rid of this technical assumption on ξ, Briand and Elie exhibited
a priori estimates in the light of [1, 4] and approximated bounded terminal values with
Malliavin diﬀerentiable ones in [5]. In more general situations, Morlais reconsidered the
problem of [17] with continuous martingale driver in [23], while recently Barrieu and El
Karoui obtained similar results in [3] but by a completely diﬀerent forward method.

Motivated by mathematical ﬁnance problems with Knightian uncertainty, Peng estab-
lished systematically in [28, 29, 30, 31] a framework of time-consistent sublinear expecta-
tion, called G-expectation. In particular, this sublinear expectation is associated with a
new type of Brownian motion (Bt)t≥0, i.e., G-Brownian motion, which has independent,
stationary and G-normally distributed increments. This process and its quadratic variation
hBi play center roles in the related nonlinear stochastic analysis. Indeed, the stochastic
integrals with respect to G-Brownian motion and its quadratic variation have been ﬁrst in-
troduced by Peng in his pioneer work [28], which are initially deﬁned on the simple process
space and later extended as linear operator on Banach completions. Thereafter, the G-
stochastic calculus is further developed, for example, in [30, 10, 19, 20]. Another important
feature of the G-expectation is found by Denis et al. in [9], namely, the G-expectation can
be represented by the upper expectation over a collection of mutually singular martingale
measures PG. Moreover, the notion of quasi-sure with respect to the associated Choquet
capacity is introduced by Denis et al. to the G-framework.

As their classical counterparts, stochastic diﬀerential equations driven by G-Brownian
motion (GSDEs) are well deﬁned in the quasi-sure sense and their solvability can be es-
tablished by the contracting mapping theorem under Lipschitz assumptions (cf. [30] and
[10]). However, the challenging problem of wellposedness for backward GSDEs (GBSDEs)
remained open until a complete theorem has been proved by Hu et al. [11].

Similarly to the classical case, the G-martingale representation theorem is heuristic to

the formulation of GBSDEs, which reads as follows

Mt = M0 + M t + Kt,

where

In contrast to the classical martingale representation, the G-martingale M is decomposed

into two parts: the G-Itˆo type integral part M = R ZdB, which is called symmetric G-

martingale, in the sense that −M is still a G-martingale; the decreasing G-martingale
part K, which vanishes in the classical theory, however, plays a signiﬁcant role in this

new context. Whether the process K admits a unique representation in the form (1.2)
is a sophisticated question. The ﬁrst positive answer is given by Peng in [27] for the G-
martingale associated with a terminal value MT ∈ Lip(ΩT ), which reads as smooth and
ﬁnitely dimensional path function. It is also worth mentioning that a series of successive
works by Soner et al. [36] and Song [39] aﬃrm the existence and uniqueness of the ﬁrst level
decomposition (1.1) for MT ∈ Lp
G(Ω), p > 1, which is the Banach completion of Lip(ΩT ).
Finally, with the help of the norm creatively introduced in Song [40], a complete theorem
for G-martingale representation has been obtained by Peng et al. [33] on a complete metric
subspace of Lp

G(Ω), p > 1.

We take into consideration of the G-martingale representation theorem and naturally,
we can formulate GBSDE as follows, where the decreasing G-martingale K appears in the
dynamics:

Under Lipschitz assumptions on the generators, Hu et al.
investigated in [11] the exis-
tence and uniqueness of the triple (Y, Z, K) in proper Banach spaces satisfying the above
equation. They started with BSDEs with bounded and smooth generators and Markovian
terminal values and constructed solutions by classical solutions of fully nonlinear PDEs (cf.
Krylov’s results in [18]). Then, the partition of unity theorem was employed in [11] to pro-
ceed a type of Galerkin approximation to solutions of GBSDEs with general parameters.
Besides, the uniqueness was deduced in [11] based on a priori estimates. In particular, the
uniqueness of K is impressive in the light of G-martingale estimates found in [39]. The
results in [11] breaks new ground in the G-expectation theory. In the accompanying paper
[12], Hu et al. discussed fundamental properties of the above GBSDE: the comparison the-
orem, the fully nonlinear Feynman-Kac formula and the related Girsanov transformation.
Moreover, the correspondence between GBSDEs and Sobolev type solutions of nonlinear
path-dependent PDEs is examined in [32].

We now compare the result of [11] with the profound works [37, 38] by Soner et al., in
which the so-called second order backward stochastic diﬀerential equations (2BSDEs) are
deeply studied. This type of equation is highly related to the GBSDE and it is deﬁned on
the Wiener space as follows:

F (s, Ys, Zs,bas)ds −Z T

t

t

Yt = ξ +Z T
where B is the canonical process, the processba is the density of hBi and PH is a collection

of martingale measures similar to PG (could be even larger). This equation is a reinforced
for all P ∈ PH and moreover, the family of
BSDE in the sense that it holds true P-a.s.
K := {K P}P∈PH should satisfy a minimum condition (then −K veriﬁes the G-martingale

Under Lipschitz assumptions, the uniqueness of the 2BSDE is proved in [37] by observing
that the solution to the 2BSDE can be represented as the (essential) supremum of a class
of martingale-driven BSDEs solutions. For the existence, the proof involves a delicate
pathwise construction: the process Y is deﬁned pathwisely by solutions of BSDEs on shift
spaces. This process veriﬁes a critical principle of optimality and thus, the structure of
2BSDE could be derived from the g-supermartingale decomposition (cf.
[26]), where the
family of processes K can be a posteriori aggregated once the stochastic integral part is
aggregated by Nutz [24]. To get rid of the measurability problem during the construction
of solutions, Soner et al. assume the technical condition that both ξ and F is uniformly
continuous in ω, whereas this assumption is removed in the recent work of Possama¨ı et
al. [34]. In the framework of 2BSDEs, the results in [37, 38] are generalized by Possama¨ı
and Zhou [35] and by Lin [21] to the quadratic case and furthermore, Matoussi et al.
[22] applied quadratic 2BSDEs to solve the utility maximization problems from [14] in
the context with non-dominated models. One could see that the GBSDE (1.3) actually
corresponds to the 2BSDE deﬁned with

F (t, y, z, a) = g(t, y, z) + h(t, y, z)a,

however, the GBSDE requires more structure conditions on the coeﬃcient and the terminal
value so that the solution can be found with more regularity adapted to the requirement
of process space in the G-framework.

The main objective of this paper is to provide the existence and uniqueness result for
scalar-valued quadratic GBSDEs adapted to the setting of [11]. Without loss of generality,
we consider only the following type of GBSDE:

Yt = ξ +Z T

t

h(s, B·∧s(·), Ys, Zs)dhBis −Z T

t

ZsdBs − (KT − Kt),

where ξ is an element in the L∞
G completion of Lip(ΩT ) and h is Lipschitz in y and locally
Lipschitz in z, similarly to [14] and [23] in the classical framework. Moreover, we require
that h is uniformly continuous with respect to ω, which is a technical condition for the
successive approximation. This assumption is stronger than the corresponding structure
condition in [11] and how to weaken such technical assumption is postponed to future
research.

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is dedicated to preliminaries in the G-
framework and the formulation of quadratic GBSDEs. In Section 3, we introduce the space
of G-BMO martingale generators and deduce a priori estimates for quadratic GBSDEs
through the G-Girsanov transformation. Meanwhile, we obtain the uniqueness straight-
In Section 4, we consider GBSDEs with discrete

ξ = ϕ(cid:0)Bt1, Bt2 − Bt1, . . . , BtN − BtN −1(cid:1) ;

h (t, B·∧t(·), Yt, Zt) = f(cid:0)t, Bt1∧t, Bt2∧t − Bt1∧t, . . . , BtN ∧t − BtN −1∧t, Yt, Zt(cid:1) ,

where 0 = t0 ≤ t1 ≤ . . . ≤ tN −1 ≤ tN = T is a given partition of [0, T ]. We proceed
with the argument of Hu and Ma in [15] to construct solutions of such GBSDEs, where
Krylov’s estimates for fully nonlinear PDEs are applied as in [11]. The last section present
the technics of discretization and regularization, moreover, the existence result for general
quadratic GBSDEs shall then be proved by successive approximation.

2. Preliminary

2.1. The G-framework. In this section, we review notations and basic results in the
framework of G-expectation, which concern the formulation of G-Brownian motion and
related G-stochastic calculus. In this paper, we only consider the one-dimensional case.
The readers interested in more details on this topic are referred to [30, 10, 19, 20].

Let Ω be a complete separable metric space, and let H be a linear space of real-valued

functions deﬁned on Ω satisfying: if Xi ∈ H, i = 1, . . . , n, then

ϕ(X1, X2, . . . , Xn) ∈ H,

∀ϕ ∈ Cl,Lip(Rn),

where Cl,Lip(Rn) is the space of all continuous real-valued functions deﬁned on Rn such
that for some C > 0 and k ∈ N depending on ϕ,

|ϕ(x) − ϕ(y)| ≤ C(1 + |x|k + |y|k)|x − y|,

∀x, y ∈ Rn.

Deﬁnition 2.1 (Sublinear expectation space). A sublinear expectation E[·] is a functional
E : H → R satisfying the following properties: for all X, Y ∈ H, we have
(a) Monotonicity: if X ≥ Y , then E[X] ≥ E[Y ];
(b) Constant preservation: E[c] = c, c ∈ R;
(c) Sub-additivity: E[X + Y ] ≤ E[X] + E[Y ];
(d) Positive homogeneity: E[λX] = λE[X], for all λ ≥ 0.
We call the triple (Ω,H, E) sublinear expectation space.
Deﬁnition 2.2 (Independence). Fix the sublinear expectation space (Ω,H, E). A random
variable Y ∈ H is said to be independent of X1, X2, . . . , Xn ∈ H, if for all ϕ ∈ Cl,Lip(Rn+1),

E [ϕ(X1, X2, . . . , Xn, Y )] = EhE [ϕ(x1, x2, . . . , xn, Y )](cid:12)(cid:12)(x1,x2,...,xn)=(X1,X2,...,Xn)i .

Now we introduce the deﬁnition of G-normal distribution.

Deﬁnition 2.3 (G-normal distribution). We say the random variable X ∈ H is G-
normally distributed, noted by X ∼ N (0, [σ, σ]), 0 ≤ σ ≤ σ, if for any function ϕ ∈
Cl.Lip(R), the function u deﬁned by u(t, x) := E[ϕ(x + √tX)], (t, x) ∈ [0,∞) × R, is a
viscosity solution of G-heat equation:

xu(cid:1) = 0; u(0, x) = ϕ(x),

Throughout this paper, we consider only the non-degenerate case, i.e., σ > 0. We now
ﬁx Ω := C[0,∞), which is equipped with the raw ﬁltration F generated by the canonical
process (Bt)t≥0, i.e., Bt(ω) = ωt, for (t, ω) ∈ [0,∞)×Ω. Let us consider the function spaces
deﬁned by

Lip(ΩT ) := {ϕ(Bt1, Bt2 − Bt1, . . . , Btn − Btn−1) :

0 ≤ t1 ≤ t2 . . . , tn ≤ T, ϕ ∈ Cl,Lip(Rn)},

Deﬁnition 2.4 (G-Brownian motion and G-expectation). On the sublinear expectation
space (Ω, Lip(Ω), E), the canonical process (Bt)t≥0 is called G-Brownian motion if the fol-
lowing properties are veriﬁed:
(a) B0 = 0;

(b) for each t, s ≥ 0, the increment Bt+s− Bt ∼ N (0, [√sσ,√sσ]) and is independent from
(Bt1, Bt2, . . . , Btn), for 0 ≤ t1 ≤ t2 ≤ . . . ≤ tn ≤ t.
Moreover, the sublinear expectation E[·] is called G-expectation.
Deﬁnition 2.5 (Conditional G-expectation). For the random variable ξ ∈ Lip(ΩT ) of the
following form:

ϕ(Bt1, Bt2 − Bt1, . . . , Btn − Btn−1), ϕ ∈ Cl,Lip(Rn),
the conditional G-expectation Eti[·], i = 1, . . . , n, is deﬁned as follows

where

Eti[ϕ(Bt1, Bt2 − Bt1, . . . , Btn − Btn−1)] = eϕ(Bt1, Bt2 − Bt1, . . . , Bti − Bti−1),

eϕ (x1, . . . , xi) = E(cid:2)ϕ(cid:0)x1, . . . , xi, Bti+1 − Bti, . . . , Btn − Btn−1(cid:1)(cid:3) .

If t ∈ (ti, ti+1), then the conditional G-expectation Et[ξ] could be deﬁned by reformulating
ξ as

ξ = bϕ(Bt1, Bt2 − Bt1, . . . , Bt − Bti, Bi+1 − Bt, . . . , Btn − Btn−1),

= (E[|ξ|p])1/p. Denote by

G(Ωt), 0 ≤ t ≤ T , is
a G-martingale if Es[Mt] = Ms, for all 0 ≤ s ≤ t ≤ T . The process (Mt)t∈[0,T ] is called
symmetric G-martingale if −M is also a G-martingale.

the canonical process (Bt)t≥0 is a P0-Brownian motion.

[9], we have the following representation theorem of G-
G(ΩT ). In the sequel, we denote by P0 the Wiener measure, under which

By the theorem above, the G-expectation can be extended to a larger domain, i.e., for
all FT measurable function X, E[X] := supP∈PG E P[X]. It is also proved in [9] that PG is
relatively weakly compact and thus its completion P G is weakly compact. Therefore, we
can naturally deﬁne the Choquet capacity C(·) by C(A) := supP ∈P G P (A), A ∈ B(ΩT ) and
introduce the notion of quasi-sure.
Deﬁnition 2.8 (Quasi-sure). A set A ∈ B(ΩT ) is a polar if C(A) = 0. A property holds
“quasi-surely” (q.s.) if it is true outside a polar set.

where the terminal value ξ and the generator h satisﬁes the following conditions.
Assumption 2.14. Assume that the generator h : [0, T ] × Ω × R2 → R satisﬁes the
following conditions:
(H0) For each (t, ω) ∈ [0, T ] × Ω, |h(t, ω, 0, 0)| + |ξ(ω)| ≤ M0;
(Hc) Moreover, h(·,·, y, z) is uniformly continuous in (t, ω) and the modulus of continuity
is independent of (y, z), i.e., for each (y, z) × R2,

(cid:12)(cid:12)h(t1, ω1, y, z) − h(t2, ω2, y, z)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ wh (|t1 − t2| + kω1 − ω2k∞) ;

(Hq) The function h is uniformly Lipschitz in y and uniformly locally Lipschitz in z, i.e.,
for each (t, ω) ∈ [0, T ] × Ω,

Remark 2.15. From Theorem 4.7 in [13], we have for each (y, z)×R2, h(·,·, y, z) ∈ H2
Due to the boundedness, in fact, for any p ≥ 2, h(·,·, y, z) ∈ Hp

trivially generalizing the argument:

a discrete terminal value is introduced here. Fixing N ∈ N and a partition πN := {0 =
t0, t1, . . . , tN = T} on [0, T ], we consider

Yt = ϕ(Bt1, Bt2 − Bt1, . . . , BtN − BtN −1)

Similarly to Assumption 2.14, we introduce the following conditions on the terminal value
ϕ(Bt1, Bt2 − Bt1, . . . , BtN − BtN −1) and the generator f .
Assumption 2.19. We assume that the generator f : [0, T ] × RN × R2 satisﬁes the fol-
lowing conditions:
(H0’) For each (t, x1, x2, . . . , xN ) ∈ [0, T ]×RN , |f (t, x1, x2, . . . xN , 0, 0)|+|ϕ(x1, x2, . . . xN )| ≤

(Hc’) Moreover, f (·,·, . . . ,·, y, z) is uniformly continuous in (t, x1, x2, . . . , xN ) and the
modulus of continuity is independent of (y, z), i.e., for each (y, z) ∈ R2,

(Hq’) The function f is uniformly Lipschitz in y and uniformly locally Lipschitz in z, i.e.,
for each (t, x1, x2, . . . , xN ) ∈ [0, T ] × RN ,
|f (t, x1, x2, . . . xN , y1, z1)−f (t, x1, x2, . . . xN , y2, z2)| ≤ Ly|y1−y2|+Lz(1+|z1|+|z2|)|z1−z2|.

3. G-Girsanov theorem and estimates for GBSDEs

In this section, we ﬁrst exhibit the Girsanov type theorem in the G-framework by in-
troducing the notion of G-BMO martingale generators. And then, we deduce a priori
estimates for solutions of GBSDEs under quadratic assumptions.

3.1. The Girsanov type theorem. Similarly to Possama¨ı and Zhou [35], we can gener-
alize the deﬁnition of BMO-martingale generators to the G-framework:

Notice that Xu et al. [42] assumed the reinforced Novikov condition on Z (Assumption
2.1 in [42]) and develop the G-Girsanov type theory. This condition is mostly used for the
proof of Lemma 2.2 in [42] (corresponding to Lemma 3.2 in the present paper) and thus,
substituting this condition by a BMO one will not alter the theory in [42]. In particular,
we have

Lemma 3.3. Suppose that Z is a G-BMO martingale generator. We deﬁne a new G-

3.2. A priori estimates for GBSDEs. Consider the solution tripe (Y, Z, K) for either
(2.2) or (2.3). Applying Lemma 3.1 and Theorem 3.2 in [35], we could easily obtain a
upper bound for Y and the G-BMO norm of Z, i.e.,

Now we establish the following stability results for both (2.2) and (2.3) (compare with

Theorem 3.2 in [35]).

Proposition 3.5. Consider two quadratic GBSDEs (2.2) with parameter (ξ1, h1) and
(ξ2, h2), where (ξi, hi) satisﬁes (H0) and (Hq) with the same constants M0, Ly and Lz.
Suppose that (Y i, Z i, K i) ∈ Gp

ters. Then, for all 0 ≤ t ≤ T ,

Remark 3.8. The uniqueness for the quadratic GBSDE can be derived from Proposition
3.5 and Proposition 3.7, or by regarding it as a quadratic 2BSDEs studied in [35].

4. The existence of solutions to discrete GBSDEs

In this section, we prove the existence of solutions to the equation (2.3), which are

constructed by solutions of the corresponding discrete PDEs.

4.1. Discrete PDEs. In this subsection, we follow Hu and Ma [15] to consider discrete
PDEs and deduce the boundedness of the ﬁrst derivatives of the solution u in x.

First, we introduce the following fully nonlinear PDE on [tN −1, T ]:

∂tu + G(D2

xN xN u + 2f (t, x1, x2, . . . , xN , u, DxN u)) = 0,

(4.1)
with u(T, x1, x2, . . . , xN ) = ϕ(x1, x2, . . . , xN ) ∈ Cb,lip(RN ), where the terminal value ϕ and
the generator f satisﬁes Assumption 2.19 and the following assumption.
Assumption 4.1. We assume that the generator f : [0, T ] × RN × R2 satisﬁes moreover
the following conditions:
(Hd’) The function f is at least C1 in x1, x2, . . . , xN , y, z, diﬀerentiable in t and twice
diﬀerentiable in x1, x2, . . . , xN , y, z, where the second derivative of f in x1, x2, . . . , xN , y, z
are bounded on the set [0, T ] × RN × [−My, My] × [−Mz, Mz], for any My, Mz > 0.
Remark 4.2. From (Hc’) and (Hq’), we could conclude that the ﬁrst derivative of f in t,
x1, x2, . . . , xN , y, z are bounded on the set [0, T ] × RN × R × [−Mz, Mz], for any Mz > 0.
Proposition 4.3. The PDE (4.1) admits a classical solution bounded by M := M(M0, Ly),
and for arbitrary small κ, there exists a constant α := α(κ), such that

kukC1+α/2,2+α([tN −1,T −κ]×R) < ∞.

Remark 4.4. The proof of this proposition is not diﬃcult by proceeding a similar argument
as Appendix §B-4 in Peng [30], where the results from Example 6.1.8 and Theorem 6.4.3

Remark 4.5. We remark here for proving the above result, we shall recall a general com-
parison result in Buckdhan and Li [8] (Theorem 6.1). Note that the function f we con-
sider is only local Lipschitz, while Theorem 6.1 in [8] requires the Lipschitz assumption.
This has little matter, since we could eventually see that DxN u is bounded by a constant
Mz := Mz(N, Lϕ, Lx, Ly), then a standard truncation technique may apply here.

In a similar way, we have moreover, for k = 1, 2, . . . , N, t ∈ [tN −1, T ],

Then, we could deﬁne the following PDE on [tN −2, tN −1]:

(cid:12)(cid:12)DxkuN (t, x(N −1), xN )(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ LN .

with the terminal condition

uN −1(tN −1, x(N −2), xN −1) := uN (tN −1, x(N −2), xN −1, 0).

From the estimate above, we know that the Lipschitz constant of uN in xN −1 is LN , then
for k = 1, 2, . . . , N − 1, t ∈ [tN −2, tN −1],

(cid:12)(cid:12)DxkuN −1(t, x(N −2), xN −1)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤(cid:18)LN +

If N = 1, then following the proof of Theorem 4.1 in [11], we can verify that for each

Yt = ϕ(BT −κ) +Z T −κ

where K is a decreasing G-martingale on [0, T − κ] with K0 = 0.

tion u and the derivative Du and D2u is bounded and α-H¨older continuous, and thus
xxu(·, B) + 2f (·, B, u(·, B), Dxu(·, B)) ∈ Hp

G(0, T − κ), for any p ≥ 2.
Similarly to (4.3) in [11], we could obtain for 0 < ˜t ≤ ˆt < T and ˜x, ˜x′ ∈ R and some

positive constant L,

|u(˜t, ˜x) − u(ˆt, ˆx)| ≤ L(cid:18)q|˜t − ˆt| + |˜x − ˆx|(cid:19) ,

which implies that (Y, Z, K) is the solution of (2.3) on [0, T ], and K is a decreasing G-
martingale with K0 = 0 and closed by KT ∈ Lp
G(ΩT ), for any p ≥ 1, which can be deﬁned
G(0, T )
as the quasi-sure limit of the decreasing sequence KT − 1
and Z ∈ Hp
G(0, T ), for any p ≥ 2, which could be deduced by the same procedure as [11].

5. Existence of solutions for general quadratic GBSDEs

In this section, we shall prove the existence result for the general quadratic GBSDE
(2.2) under Assumption 2.14. Indeed, we start by considering the solution to the discrete
GBSDE (2.3) under assumptions weaker than (Hd’) and construct solutions to (2.2) by
successive approximation.

Step 1: Fix N ∈ N and the partition πN on [0, T ]. We consider the GBSDE (2.3) with
the generator ˆf satisfying Assumption 2.19 and what follows.

20

YING HU, YIQING LIN, AND ABDOULAYE SOUMANA HIMA

Assumption 5.1. We assume that the generator ˆf : [0, T ] × RN × R2 satisﬁes moreover
the following conditions:
(Hd”) The ﬁrst derivative of f in t, the ﬁrst and the second derivatives of f in x1, x2, . . . , xN
are bounded on the set [0, T ] × RN × [−My, My] × [−Mz, Mz], for any My, Mz > 0.

(y, z) ∈ R2, we deﬁne

In what follows, we shall regularize ˆh in y and z: for each (t, x1, x2, . . . , xN ) ∈ [0, T ]×RN ,
f n (t, x1, x2, . . . , xN , y, z) :=ZR2

ˆf (t, x1, x2, . . . , xN , y − ˜y, z − ˜z) ρn (˜y, ˜z) d˜yd˜z,

(Hq’) with the same Lipschitz constants.

where ρn is a positive smooth function such that its support is contained in a 1

and RR2 ρn = 1. Without loss of generality, we assume that, for each n ∈ N, f n satisﬁes
Obviously, f n has bounded ﬁrst derivatives in y and z on the set [0, T ]×RN×[−My, My]×
[−Mz, Mz], for any My, Mz > 0, because that ˆf satisﬁes (Hq’). We now calculate the sec-
ond derivative of f n in y by

ˆf (t, x1, x2, . . . , xN , ˜y, ˜z)

Since on the set [0, T ] × RN × [−My − 1

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ˆf (t, x1, x2, . . . , xN , y, z)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ M0 + Ly(cid:18)My + 1(cid:19) + Lz (Mz + 2)2 := Myz,

we have

∂y2 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ C(n)Myz(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

∂2ρn

which means that f n has bounded second derivative in y on the set [0, T ]×RN×[−My, My]×
[−Mz, Mz], for any My, Mz > 0. Similar result can be obtained for the second derivative
of f n in z.

From the results in the last section, we know that, for any p ≥ 2, the GBSDE (2.3) with
G(0, T ). We now verify that {Y n}n∈N

from which have that, for 0 ≤ s ≤ t ≤ T , Es[ ˆKt] = ˆKs by applying Proposition 2.5 in
Hu et al. [11] and ˆK0 = 0. Note that p could be arbitrary large, which is ensured by the
uniform boundedness of Y n and the G-BMO norm of Z n. Therefore, for any p ≥ 2, we
could ﬁnd a triple ( ˆY , ˆZ, ˆK) ∈ Gp
G(0, T ), which is a solution to the GBSDE (2.3) under
Assumption 2.19 and 5.1.

Step 2: Fix N ∈ N and the partition πN on [0, T ]. We consider the GSDE (2.3) with a
generator ¯f satisfying Assumption 2.19. In this step, we shall construct the solution to such

Proceeding the same argument as in the last step, we can show that the ﬁrst derivative
of ˆf n in t, the ﬁrst and second derivatives of ˆf n in xi, i = 1, 2, . . . , N, are bounded on the
set [0, T ] × RN × [−My, My] × [−Mz, Mz], for any My, Mz > 0. Therefore, recalling the
result in the last step, we obtain that, for any p ≥ 2, the GBSDE (2.3) with the coeﬃcient
ˆf n admits a solution ( ˆY n, ˆZ n, ˆK n) ∈ Gp

G(0, T ).

For n, m ∈ N, n ≥ m, 0 ≤ t ≤ T , by the deﬁnition of ˆf n and (Hc’),

We could conclude in a similar way as in the previous step that for any p ≥ 2, there exists
a triple ( ¯Y , ¯Z, ¯K) ∈ Gp

G(0, T ), which solves the GBSDE (2.3) under Assumption 2.19.

To study the more general GBSDE (2.2), we need the following assumption on the

Indeed, since wh is a concave function, by Lemma 2.12 in Bai and Lin [2], we have

as m, n → ∞.

and then we could apply the Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem to deduce the
convergence of (5.6), which yields (5.5). For t ∈ [tk−1, tk], k = 1, 2, . . . , N(n), we calculate
(5.7) and obtain

Thus, for α > 2,

E[kBn,s(·) − Bs(·)kα

which implies (5.7).

as n → ∞,

We conclude from (5.4) that, for p > 2, there exists a process Y ∈ S p

t − Kt(cid:12)(cid:12)p′/2i −→ 0,

as n → ∞,

Thus, there exists process K with K0 = 0 and KT ∈ Lp′/2
for 0 ≤ t ≤ T ,

which implies that K is a decreasing G-martingale. In conclusion, since p and p′ can be
arbitrarily large, we could ﬁnally ﬁnd the triple (Y, Z, K) ∈ G2
G(0, T ) which solves (2.2).
We complete the proof.
