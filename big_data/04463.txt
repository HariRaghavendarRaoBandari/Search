Abstract

Spin 1

2 honeycomb materials have gained substantial interest due to their exotic magnetism
and possible application in quantum computing. However, in all current materials out-of-plane

interactions are interfering with the in-plane order, hence a true 2D magnetic honeycomb sys-

tem is still of demand. Here, we report the exfoliation of the magnetic semiconductor α-RuCl3
into the ﬁrst halide monolayers and the magnetic characterization of the spin 1
2 honeycomb ar-
rangement of turbostratically stacked RuCl3 monolayers. The exfoliation is based on a reduc-
tive lithiation/hydration approach, which gives rise to a loss of cooperative magnetism due to

the disruption of the spin 1

2 state by electron injection into the layers. After an oxidative treat-
ment, cooperative magnetism similar to the bulk is restored. The oxidized pellets of restacked

single layers feature a magnetic transition at TN = 7 K in the in-plane direction, while the
magnetic properties in the out-of-plane direction vastly differ from bulk α-RuCl3. The macro-
scopic pellets of RuCl3 therefore behave like a stack of monolayers without any symmetry

nipulate the spin structure of RuCl3 is of interest for research in frustrated magnetism and

The emergence of graphene1,2 initiated the development of a variety of single layer compounds

as well as investigations into their electronic, optical and mechanical properties. The materials that

are most actively examined are monolayers either composed of a single element, such as carbon

based graphene or black phosphorus single layers, or binary transition metal chalcogenides.3–6

Binary halide nanosheets have been predicted based on chemical intuition3,4 or ab initio calcula-

tions.7 Yet, no single layer halides have been synthesized so far, even though this class of com-

pounds features an array of interesting electrical and magnetic properties.

The magnetic semiconductor α-RuCl3 is one such example. While it was investigated in the
past as a host for intercalants8,9 and as a lithium ion conductor,10 current research focuses on its
magnetic properties. Due to its layered honeycomb structure of spin 1
2 Ru3+ centers in combi-
nation with spin orbit coupling (SOC), it is one of the few known materials featuring a zigzag
antiferromagnetic (AF) ground state below a temperature of TN1 = 8 K.11–13 In the zigzag order,
the magnetic moments form ferromagnetic (FM) zigzag chains, whose magnetization direction is

opposed to the neighboring chains within the plane. Additionally, there is a further magnetic phase

transition observed at TN2 = 14 K. The origin of this transition is currently still under debate.

This type of ordering was ﬁrst observed in Na2IrO3

14–16 and explained by the Kitaev-Heisenberg

model,17,18 which describes that a frustrated spin 1

2 honeycomb arrangement could lead to a vari-
ety of interesting spin structures. Based on the competition among the exchange interactions up to

the third neighbor, the system could possibly be pushed into a quantum spin liquid regime by the

manipulation of the competing interactions, thereby opening up applications in quantum comput-
ing.17,19 Yet, the Na+ ions in the interlayer space of Na2IrO3 lead to disadvantageous interactions
between the iridate layers, which interfere with theoretical predictions of a honeycomb arrange-

2

ment of spin 1
manipulate the spin structure of real materials featuring a spin 1

2 magnetic arrays.20 Eliminating the interlayer interaction could provide a route to

2 honeycomb arrangement.

In RuCl3, where no charged ions are in between the honeycomb layers, the interlayer inter-
actions are smaller than in Na2IrO3, but are not neglegible.21 The appearance of several mag-
netic transitions between the zigzag order at TN1 = 8 K and the second ordering temperature of
TN2 = 14 K have been discussed in regards to the stacking behavior of α-RuCl3. One argument
attributes the transitions to the interplay between the ﬁrst, second and third nearest neighbor as

well as interlayer interactions,13 while others claim that ABAB stacking faults in the ABC stack
of RuCl3 layers are responsible for the variety of magnetic transitions.22 While both of these argu-
ments emphasize the importance of an ordered stacking, the inﬂuence of the interlayer interactions

could also be investigated by deliberately decoupling the interlayer interactions.

Two strategies to further reduce the interlayer interactions and thereby possibly decouple the

magnetic behavior between the layers can be conceived. The ﬁrst is to increase the interlayer space

by introducting a nonmagnetic compound. This appproach has been realizied in Na3Ni2SbO6 and
Na3Ni2BiO6-δ , where hydration of the interlayer Na+ ions increases the interlayer distance by
about one Ångstrom.23,24 Another example is the CrCl3-graphite intercalation compound C20.9CrCl3,
where the intercalation of CrCl3 single layers into graphite resulted in the emergence of spin glass
behavior.25 Exfoliation of 2D honeycomb compounds into monolayers and restacking the layers

to form a solid with turbostratic disorder is the second strategy to reduce interlayer coupling. This

kind of disorder can be described by random rotations and/or translations of the sheets around an

axis perpendicular to the monolayer. Recently, it was shown that the stacking angle of two MoS2
monolayers has a strong effect on the electronic interlayer coupling.26 Thus, the restacking of sin-

gle layers into a turbostratically disordered solid should signiﬁcantly alter the magnetic properties

of a layered compounds.

Here, we present a form of RuCl3 with turbostratic disorder (t-RuCl3) introduced by exfoli-
ation into single layers and subsequent restacking into a lamellar, disordered solid. To the best

of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report of a single layer halide as well as of a single layer com-

3

pound with a S = 1

2 honeycomb order. Furthermore, we show the disappearance of cooperative
magnetism in the intermediary compound Li0.2RuCl3 and in the restacked pellet of the partially
reduced [RuCl3]x- single layers. By an oxidative reaction step, a multisheet stack of [RuCl3]x- is
converted to t-RuCl3, which features a magnetic transition at TN = 7 K. The similarities and differ-
ences of the magnetic properties between bulk α-RuCl3 and restacked t-RuCl3 will be discussed
in regards to the changes of the electronic and crystal structure.

For the synthesis of t-RuCl3, large single crystals of α-RuCl3 were prepared by chemical va-
por transport from 1023 K to 973 K. X-ray diffraction on a single crystal conﬁrmed the recently
reported monoclinic space group C2/m,27 in which the α-RuCl3 layers consist of edge sharing
RuCl6 octahedra and are separated by a van der Waals gap. Every third octahedron is vacant, re-
sulting in a honeycomb lattice of Ru3+ centers. The crystal structure is shown in ﬁgure 1 d) and

e). The crystals were treated with LiBH4 in THF under inert atmosphere to yield Li0.2RuCl3 ac-
cording to a modiﬁed literature procedure.10 Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) and atomic emission

spectroscopy conﬁrmed the composition of Li0.2RuCl3. In contact with H2O, Li0.2RuCl3 sponta-
neously starts to exfoliate into [RuCl3]x- single layers. After shaking for 24 h, the black suspension
was centrifuged to separate unreacted crystallites and larger agglomerates from the liquid. The dis-

persion was further washed three times by centrifugation and replacement of the supernatant liquid

with water. The nanosheets form a stable suspension in water as indicated by the zeta potential of
-51.4 mV. [RuCl3]x- nanosheets were both characterized as monolayers on 270 nm SiO2/Si sub-
strates by optical and atomic force microscopy (AFM) and on lacey carbon grids by transmission
electron microscopy (TEM). Pellets of [RuCl3]x- nanosheets were prepared by evaporation of the
solvent and were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). Monolayers on substrates
and pellets of [RuCl3]x- were oxidized in an atomsphere of Br2 over night to yield t-RuCl3, which
was characterized by AFM and PXRD. All compounds were examined by EDX, conﬁrming the

Ru : Cl ratio of 1 : 3.

Figures 1 a) to c) show the images of α-RuCl3 crystals, the intermediate product Li0.2RuCl3 and
an aqueous [RuCl3]x- dispersion as well as the crystal structure of α-RuCl3. As seen in ﬁgure 1

4

f), monolayers of [RuCl3]x- were located by the enhanced interference contrast on the SiO2/Si
substrate, a method known from investigations on graphene and MoS2.28,29 Different batches of
[RuCl3]x- dispersions were analyzed to ensure reproducability. The single layers covered areas of
up to 450 µm2 and thus their areas are of the same order of magnitude as the largest chemically
exfoliated MoS2 monolayers known to date.30

The height of the [RuCl3]x- single layers was analyzed by AFM for the monolayer on the
SiO2/Si substrate and by PXRD for the restacked pellet. Figure 1 e) shows one exemplary AFM
image with a height of 1.69(9) nm for a [RuCl3]x- monolayer. It is a common phenomenon that
the monolayer height on the substrate differs from the nanosheet terrace height on top of an-
other nanosheet.31 The height of a [RuCl3]x- single layer folded onto itself was determined to
be 1.06(6) nm. This value is similar to that of chemically exfoliated MoS2, where the single layer
has a height of 1.0 - 1.2 nm.32 Out-of-plane PXRD measurements of the [RuCl3]x- pellet (ﬁg. 2
a) in reﬂection geometry yielded a height of d(001) = 1.12 nm, conﬁrming the results from AFM.
The small height difference might originate from variations in relative humidity, which recently

were shown to have a large inﬂuence on the layer height of phosphatoantimonic acid H3Sb3P2O14
nanosheets.33

Though the height of a single layer from PXRD and AFM are in agreement, there is still a
discrepancy compared to the height of a single layer of the α-RuCl3 crystal structure (0.57 nm).
This is most likely due to the presence of residual charge on a single [RuCl3]x- layer, which is
indicated by the high zeta potential of - 51.4 mV of the [RuCl3]x- dispersion. The surface charge
would attract hydrated counterions, thus increasing the layer height depending on the height by the

amount of water surrounding the ions. After the reductive intercalation, the ratio of Ru : Cl = 1 : 3

remains unchanged according to EDX. Therefore, we assume that the charge injected by LiBH4
resides in the d-bands of Ru, leading to a 4d5+x state of Ru(3–x)+ in [RuCl3]x-.

The [RuCl3]x- monolayers and pellets were oxidized in a Br2 atmosphere to remove the resid-
ual layer charge, leading to t-RuCl3. The single layer height measured by AFM shrank from
1.69(9) nm to 1.08(17) nm for a nanosheet on the substrate and from 1.06(6) nm to 0.72(11) nm in

5

the folded monolayer. According to PXRD measurements, the restacked layers in the pellet feature

a similar decrease of the stacking distance from 1.12 nm before to 0.59 nm after oxidation. The
latter value is close to the layer height of 0.57 nm in bulk α-RuCl3. Again, the AFM and PXRD
data are in good agreement with a slightly higher value from AFM, possibly due to surface rough-
ness. Hence the present interlayer species in [RuCl3]x- were expelled by the oxidative treatment
with Br2 to yield the oxidized nanosheets and HBr.

Since the exfoliation process induces physcial stress and bromine’s high oxidative power could

potentially damage the sample, the integrity of the in-plane crystal structure was investigated by
TEM on the [RuCl3]x- single layer as well as PXRD on a multilayer stack of [RuCl3]x- and t-RuCl3.
Figure 2 b) displays a TEM bright ﬁeld image of a single [RuCl3]x- layer partially folded onto itself
on a lacey carbon grid. The inset features the in-plane (hk0) reﬂections from selected area electron

diffraction (SAED). The reﬂections were assigned by simulationg the diffraction pattern based on
the space group C2/m of bulk α-RuCl3. Figure S1 shows the simulated diffraction pattern. The
d-values of the ﬁrst ﬁve most intense reﬂections, as listed in Table S4, coincide with the d-values

from the simulation based on the single crystal data within the margin of error in TEM. Therefore,

we conclude that the in-plane structure is maintained in the exfoliation process.

Additionally, PXRD was performed on the pellet of restacked [RuCl3]x- layers and t-RuCl3
in transmission geometry, to check the effect of the Br2 treatment on the in-plane structure. The
resulting diffraction patterns are shown in ﬁgure 2 c) and consist of the (hk0) reﬂections with

an intensity tail towards higher angles. The peak positions and d-values coincide with those of
the (hk0) reﬂections of single crystal α-RuCl3 (Tab. S4), indicating the retention of the in-plane
structure in the [RuCl3]x- pellet, as well as in oxidized t-RuCl3.

The diffraction patterns also offer information about the ordering of the layers in the multi-

stack. A noticable feature is the Warren-type peak shape tailing off towards higher angles. The

anisotropic form originates from the diffraction of the X-ray beam by a lattice with two dimen-

sional translation symmetry without any ordering in the third dimension.34–36 Therefore, the peak

shape is the ﬁrst indicator for the absence of order in the third dimension, signifying turbostratic

6

disorder. A similar conclusion can be drawn from the out-of-plane PXRD, where the pellets of
[RuCl3]x- and t-RuCl3 feature an exponential intensity decay for the series of (00l) reﬂections
with higher order. This is known from tetrabutylammonium (TBA) intercalated, swollen lamellar
phases such as TBA0.35Ti0.91O2, TBA0.13MnO2 and TBA0.2RuO2.1.37–39 The (00l) reﬂections of
the ordered bulk α-RuCl3 features a different intensity distribution, which is displayed in ﬁgure
S2. Therefore, the presence of turbostratic disorder is suggested by the in- and out-of-plane PXRD

patterns.

The introduction of turbostratic disorder and the changes in the oxidation state are expected

to affect the magnetic properties of the different compounds. This is reﬂected in the in-plane
(ip) and out-of-plane (op) investigations of the magnetic properties of α-RuCl3 and Li0.2RuCl3 as
well as of the pellets of [RuCl3]x- and t-RuCl3. The presence of magnetic transitions, the Weiss
temperature and the magnetic moment were used as a measure for the cooperative character of the
magnetic properties. The magnetic susceptibilities of t-RuCl3 and α-RuCl3 are presented in ﬁgure
3, while the data for Li0.2RuCl3 and [RuCl3]x- is featured in the supporting information. Figure 4
summarizes the results of Curie-Weiss ﬁts for all compounds.

In bulk α-RuCl3, we observe two magnetic transitions at TN1 = 7 K and TN2 = 13 K for
the in-plane measurements, which were determined from the dMT/dT plot displayed in the sup-

porting information and are consistent with previous experiments.11–13,22 The Weiss temperatures

θCW,ip of 31.2 (3) K and θCW,op of - 137.7(5) K suggest an in-plane FM exchange and out-of-plane

AF interactions. These results are comparable to previous studies, where the values range from
θCW,ip = 37 K to 68 K and θCW,op = - 145 K to - 150 K.11,13 The effective magnetic moment
µe f f ,ip = 2.26(1) µB / Ru and µe f f ,op = 2.22(1) µB / Ru are also in the range of previously reported
values (µe f f ,ip = 2.0 - 2.14 µB / Ru and µe f f ,op = 2.3 - 2.7 µB / Ru11,13) and are much higher than
the spin-only value of 1.75 µB / Ru, thereby indicating the presence of SOC.11,12

Upon the reductive intercalation of lithium ions into the interlayer space, the 4d5 electron

conﬁguration of Ru3+ changes to a 4d6 state with S = 0 for roughly 20 % of the Ru centers in
Li0.2RuCl3. This is abbreviated as "4d5.2" in Figure 4. The disturbance of the spin 1

2 order leads

7

to paramagnetic behavior, which is associated with a decaying magnetic susceptibility with in-

creasing temperature without any magnetic transition in the in- and out-of-plane direction. The

decrease of the in-plane (θCW,ip = 0.6(2) K, µe f f ,ip = 1.08(2) µB / Ru) as well as out-of-plane
Weiss temperatures and magnetic moments (θCW,op = 17.8(3) K, µe f f ,op = 1.58(1) µB / Ru) also
reﬂects this trend. This suggest that the cooperative magnetism of α-RuCl3 has been disturbed
by electron injection into the RuCl3-layers. Recently, a similar change in magnetism has been
3− layer by oxidation with
reported in Na2IrO3, where holes were injected into the [Na1/3Ir2/3O2]
Br2. There, the low spin electron conﬁguration changes from 5d5 to 5d4 with S = 0 due to SOC,
inducing paramagnetic behavior.40

2

The magnetic data of the restacked pellet of [RuCl3]x- measured within the plane exhibits a
similarly decaying magnetization curve without any features, similar to the paramagnetic behav-

ior of Li0.2RuCl3. Although the Weiss temperatures indicate slightly antiferromagnetic behavior
(θCW,ip = - 13.5(7) K and θCW,op = - 13.5(3) K), no magnetic transitions were observed in the

out-of-plane direction and only a slight shoulder is visible in the in-plane direction. The effective
magnetic moment is very similar to that of Li0.2RuCl3 with values of µe f f ,ip = 0.87(1) µB / Ru and
µe f f ,op = 1.47(1) µB / Ru.

Upon oxidation of the [RuCl3]x- pellet by Br2 to t-RuCl3 and the associated restoration of the
4d5 state, the ordered magnetism within the plane returns. This is reﬂected by a transition in the

in-plane data of the magnetic susceptibility at TN = 7 K. Also, it is accompanied by an increase
of the Weiss temperature as well as the effective magnetic moment to θCW,ip = 17.8(7) K and
µe f f ,ip = 2.33(1) µB / Ru respectively, values similar to those found in the in-plane data of α-
RuCl3 (θCW,ip = 31.2 (3) K; µe f f ,ip = 2.26(1) µB / Ru). In contrast, the out-of-plane measurement
is characterized by paramagnetic behavior with a decaying magnetic susceptibility towards higher

temperatures. The out-of-plane Weiss temperature θCW,op = 2(2) K also indicates paramagnetic
behavior, similar to the low effective magnetic moment µe f f ,op = 1.27(1) µB / Ru, which is much
closer to the value found in the paramagnetic Li0.2RuCl3 (µe f f ,op = 1.58(1) µB / Ru) than the one
found in α-RuCl3 (µe f f ,op = 2.22(1) µB / Ru).

8

The return of cooperative magnetism at TN = 7 K as well as the changes in the Weiss temper-
ature and magnetic moment suggest a restoration of the magnetic order based on the 4d5 electron

conﬁguration. However, in contrast to the bulk we observe only one magnetic transition in the
in-plane direction. Another difference compared to bulk α-RuCl3 is the paramagnetic behavior of
the out-of-plane data, with the Weiss temperature and the effective magnetic moment being more

similar to the paramagnetic Li0.2RuCl3.

To explain this behavior, the turbostratic disorder, as observed in the in- and out-of-plane PXRD

data, has to be considered next to the electron conﬁguration. Since the symmetry relation between

the in-plane and the stacking direction is lifted by turbostratic disorder, no long range magnetic

order can be expected outside the t-RuCl3 single layer. This could be interpreted as a structural
decoupling of the nanosheets, thereby possibly weakening the magnetic interlayer interactions,

which probably also affects the in-plane magnetism. Therefore, even though macroscopic pellets

of RuCl3 layers were investigated, the results seem representative for the behavior of single layers
of RuCl3. Figure 5 gives an overview of the electronic and structural differences between the
presented compounds.

Even though the exact in-plane spin structure of t-RuCl3 is yet unknown, the combination of the
4d5 electron conﬁguration, the retention of the Ru honeycomb arrangement as well as the magnetic
transition at the same temperature as the zigzag order in bulk α-RuCl3 hint towards the restoration
of the magnetic order in t-RuCl3, with the zigzag structure being one possible candidate. Further
investigations, especially neutron diffraction experiments, are of great interest to elucidate the spin

structure of t-RuCl3 in the single layer or restacked form.

In conclusion, we presented a synthetic route towards RuCl3 nanosheets, the ﬁrst exfoliation
of a binary halide. Investigations of its in-plane structure show that it was retained during the ex-
foliation process, leading to dispersed, charged [RuCl3]x- monolayers in suspension. Deposition
of the sheets is possible and is used to create a pellet with turbostratic disorder. Magnetic mea-

surements show that the intermediary pellet is a paramagnet. Upon oxidizing the pellet, the long
range magnetic order of the spin 1

2 honeycomb arrangement is reestablished within the plane. A

9

very different Weiss temperature and effective magnetic moment were observed in the out-of-plane
direction compared to bulk α-RuCl3, probably due to turbostratic disorder. Therefore, the pellet
of t-RuCl3 seems to behave like a stack of magnetically decoupled single layers which can be
obtained and characterized in bulk form. To our knowledge, a top-down approach of exfoliation

and restacking of nanosheets to deliberately introduce turbostratic disorder enabling the manipula-

tion of the magnetic properties of a solid has not been reported yet. We believe that the approach

presented herein provides a synthetic tool to establish macroscopic quasi 2D model systems for
Kitaev-Heisenberg physics in spin 1

2 honeycomb magnets and areas beyond.

state and in combination with the stacking, help to explain the evolution of the spin order.

Synthesis

α-RuCl3 Large crystals were grown by chemical vapor transport as described in the literature.S1
Commercial RuCl3 powder (99.9 %, Roth) was sealed under vacuum in a quartz ampoule. The
powder was heated with 3 K min-1 to 1023 K and held there for 36 h to 120 h, depending on the

amount with a temperature gradient of approximately 50 K to 75 K from the feed to the growth

zone. The reaction yielded black, crystalline platelets with edge lengths of up to 3 mm, which were

analysed by means of PXRD, single crystal X-ray diffraction, SEM-EDX and elemental analysis.

Smaller crystals for single crystal X-ray diffraction were grown at 923 K.

Li0.2RuCl3 The synthesis is a modiﬁcation of a known procedure.S2 α-RuCl3 was combined
with tetrahydrofurane (THF) and LiBH4 under argon atmosphere. In a typical synthesis, 11.77 mL
dry THF were added to 483 mg (2.33 mmol, 1 eq.) α-RuCl3 crystals in a Schlenk ﬂask under Ar
atmosphere. 0.23 mL of LiBH4 (2 mol L-1 in THF, 0.466 mmol, 0.2 eq.) were added under counter
ﬂow of argon and the mixture was stirred over night. After washing the product with 3x 12 mL

dry THF, Li0.2RuCl3 was introduced into double distilled H2O and shaken for over night to yield
a black suspension. The remaining solid was separated by centrifugation. The concentration of

the dispersion was 2.3 mM. The dispersion was washed by centrifugation at 18000 rpm and the

remaining clear supernatant separated from the pellet. The solid pellet was redispersed in water

and the washing procedure repeated three times. Pellets were prepared by dropping parts of the

dispersion onto a glass substrate. Upon solvent evaporation, new drops were added until the desired

amount was reached.

[RuCl3]x- pellets on substrates were placed in a closed vessel with some droplets of

t-RuCl3
bromine over night.

Diffraction data sets were collected at 298 K on a three circle diffractometer (Bruker AXS,

Karlsruhe, Germany) equipped with SMART APEX I CCD, using Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073
Å). The collection and reduction of data were carried out with the BRUKER SUITE software

package.S4 It turned out that the crystal under investigation was systematically twinned (dovetail

twin for the monoclinic system), and the twin-law ( 100, 0-10, 001) had to be applied during data

reduction. The intensities were corrected for absorption effects applying a multi-scan method with

TWINABS.S3 The structure was solved by Direct Methods and reﬁned by full matrix least-squares

ﬁtting with the SHELXTL software package.S5 Some residual occupancy was found in the empty
octahedron of the α-RuCl3 structure, a consequence of disorder in the layer stacking. Experimental
details of data collection and crystallographic data are given in Tables S1, S2 and S3.

Other analytical methods

PXRD in-plane measurements were performed on a Stoe Stadi-P (Stoe Darmstadt, Germany) uti-

lizing Cu-Kα1 radiation (Ge(111) monochromator, λ = 1.54059 Å) and a Mythen Dectris de-
tector in transmission geometry. The out-of-plane measurements were performed on a Bruker D8-

Advance with Cu-Kα1 radiation (Ge(111) monochromator, λ = 1.54059 Å), in reﬂection geometry,
using a Vantec detector. All powder diffraction patterns were recorded at room temperature.

Elemental analysis for lithium and ruthenium was performed on a Vista Pro ICP-AES spec-

trometer. Ruthenium to chloride ratios were measured on a scanning electron microscope (SEM;

Vega TS 5130 MM, Tescan) with a SEM-EDX using a Si/Li detector (Oxford).

AFM was performed on a MFP-3D AFM by Asylum Research / Oxford Instruments in inter-

mittent contact mode with Olympus cantilever (resonance frequency approximately 300 kHz).

TEM samples were prepared by dropping the colloidal nanosheet suspension of [RuCl3]x- onto
a lacey carbon ﬁlm/copper grid (Plano) and subsequent drying under IR-light irradiation. TEM

was performed with a Phillips CM30 ST (300 kV, LaB6 cathode), with a CMOS camera (TemCam-
F216, Tietz) for recording bright ﬁeld images and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pat-

terns.

Measurements of the magnetic properties were performed on a MPMS by Quantum Design.

The speciﬁc heat data was collected on a PPMS, also by Quantum Design.
