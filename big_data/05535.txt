Abstract.

We explore exact f (R) gravity solutions that mimic Chaplygin-gas inspired ΛCDM cosmology.
Starting with the original, generalized and modiﬁed Chaplygin gas equations of state, we
reconstruct the forms of f (R) Lagrangians. The resulting solutions are generally quadratic in
the Ricci scalar, but have appropriate ΛCDM solutions in limiting cases. These solutions, given
appropriate initial conditions, can be potential candidates for scalar ﬁeld-driven early universe
expansion (inﬂation) and dark energy-driven late-time cosmic acceleration.

1. Introduction

Explaining the not-yet-so-fully-understood accelerated expansion phases of the early
and current stages of the Universe as well as the ﬂatness in the rotational curves of
spiral galaxies have certainly become in the top of to-do lists in modern cosmology and
astrophysics. As a result, current research into the nature of so-called dark energy and
dark matter has led to reconsiderations of the gravitational physics (General Relativity,
GR) and cosmic ﬂuid (baryonic matter) models underlying the standard cosmological
model.

Among a large pool of alternative theories put forward to explain early-universe
inﬂation [1] and late-time cosmic acceleration [2–7] are f (R) theories of gravity (see
Refs. [8–12] for more detailed reviews). Such theories were ﬁrst speculated on by
Buchdahl [13] but recent interest has centered on their potential candidacy as possible
infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) completions of GR (see, e.g., [14–18]). More recently,
these gravitational alternative theories have found cosmological applications in, inter
alia, the dynamical study of homogeneous cosmological models [19–30] and the linear
growth of large-scale structures [31–39].

For quite sometime now, the Chaplygin gas [40] has been considered as another
alternative cosmological model of a Friedmann-Lemaˆıtre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW)
universe with an exotic perfect-ﬂuid equation of state [41–46]. The model provides a
cosmic expansion history consistent with a universe that transitions from a decelerating
matter-dominated phase to a late-time accelerated one [44,47,48]. As a result, there have
been several eﬀorts to come up with a uniﬁed description of both dark matter and dark
energy as manifestations of a single cosmic ﬂuid that is the Chaplygin gas [44, 49, 50].

The main objective of this work is to come up with a uniﬁed picture of both
alternative cosmological scenarios discussed above. We study models of f (R) gravity
which, when we impose the Chaplygin gas equations of state (EoS) to their eﬀective
pressure and energy density, produce viable exact solutions that reduce to the ΛCDM
scenario in the approximate cosmological limits.

The rest of this paper is organised as follows: In Sec. (2) we give a brief overview
of f (R) gravitational models and their corresponding ﬁeld equations, and describe the
background cosmic evolution under consideration. We give a brief description of the
Chaplygin gas model and its generalized and modiﬁed EoS in Sec. (3). By comparing
these EoS with the EoS for f (R) models under certain assumptions, we deduce the form
of the corresponding f (R) Lagrangians. Finally in Sec. (4) we discuss the results and
give our conclusions.

Natural units ( = c = kB = 8πG = 1) will be used throughout this paper, and
Latin indices run from 0 to 3. The symbols ∇, ˜∇ and the overdot . represent the usual
covariant derivative, the spatial covariant derivative, and diﬀerentiation with respect
to cosmic time. We use the (− + ++) spacetime signature and the Riemann tensor is
deﬁned by

Ra

where the Γa

bd are the Christoﬀel symbols (i.e., symmetric in the lower indices) deﬁned

bd =

gae (gbe,d + ged,b − gbd,e) .

(2)

The Ricci tensor is obtained by contracting the ﬁrst and the third indices of the Riemann
tensor:

Rab = gcdRcadb .

(3)

Unless otherwise stated, primes ′ etc are shorthands for derivatives with respect to the
Ricci scalar

and f is used as a shorthand for f (R).

2. f (R) Models

The action for f (R) gravity can be given as

A =Z d4x√−g(cid:20)1

2

f (R) + Lm(cid:21) ,

(4)

(5)

where f (R) is a general diﬀerentiable function of the Ricci scalar and Lm corresponds
to the matter Lagrangian. For models of gravitation with such action, applying the
variational principle with respect to the metric gab results in the generalized ﬁeld
equations

Gab = T m

ab + T R

ab ≡ Tab ,

(6)

where Tab is the total energy momentum tensor (EMT) and is conserved by virtue of
the Einstein tensor Gab ≡ Rab − 1
2 Rgab being a covariantly conserved quantity. Here T m
is the EMT of standard matter and

ab

ab =

gab (f − Rf ′) + ∇b∇af ′ − gab∇c∇cf ′ + (1 − f ′) Gab

(7)

is the curvature contribution to the EMT. Since T m
from Eq. (6) that T R
components of the thermodynamical quantities are given by

ab is a conserved quantity, we see
ab should also be conserved. In this setting, the linearized curvature

(12)

(13)

and plays an important role as a constraint relation between matter and curvature.

Analogous to the matter EoS pm = wmµm, where wm is the matter EoS parameter,

we can deﬁne the EoS for the curvature ﬂuid as pR = wRµR.

For FLRW spacetimes, the Ricci scalar R is given by

R = 2 ˙Θ +

4
3

Θ2 ,

(14)

where Θ is the cosmic expansion parameter related to the cosmological scale factor a(t)
and the Hubble parameter H(t) via the equations

˙a(t)
a(t)

= 3H(t) .

Θ ≡ 3
Solving for ˙Θ one can rewrite the above equation as

˙Θ =

R

2 (cid:18)1 −

3R

Θ2(cid:19) .

If the Ricci scalar varies slowly, i.e., if R is almost constant, the solution of this ordinary
diﬀerential equation (o.d.e) takes the form

Θ =

2

√3R tanh"r R

3

(t − t0)# ,

(17)

for some constant of integration t0 that can be taken to be the time at the commencement
of the inﬂationary phase of expansion. Solving for the cosmological scale factor gives

a(t) = a0vuutcosh"r R

3

(t0 − t)# .

(18)

For simplicity we set t0 ≃ 0. During steady-state exponential expansion in a de Sitter
spacetime (such as during inﬂation or late-time evolution), the approximation ˙Θ → 0
results in

and the matter content evolves according to

µm = µ0(cid:18) a(t)

a0 (cid:19)−3(1+wm)

.

During such an exponentially expanding cosmic evolution phase, for an initial energy
density µ0, we see that the matter energy density decays exponentially:

µm = µ0e−(1+wm)Θt .

3. Chaplygin-gas Solutions

Chaplygin-gas ﬂuid models are perfect-ﬂuid models currently posing as candidates to
unify dark energy and dark matter. These ﬂuid models were originally studied [40] in
the context of aerodynamics, but only recently did they see cosmological applications
[41–43, 49]. Among the interesting features of these models is that in the FLRW
framework, a smooth transition between an inﬂationary phase, the matter-dominated
decelerating era, and then late-time accelerated de Sitter phase of cosmic expansion can
be achieved [44, 47].

3.1. Original and Generalized Chaplygin Gases

In the original treatment, the negative pressure associated with the Chaplygin gas
models is related to the (positive) energy density through the EoS

p = −

A
µα

(22)

for positive constant A and α = 1. But this was later generalized [47, 51] to include
0 ≤ α ≤ 1. One of the ﬁrst cosmological interpretations of such a ﬂuid model was
given in [52] where for ﬂat universes, Eq.
(22) corresponds to a viscosity term that
is inversely proportional to dust energy density. Ever since the discovery of cosmic
acceleration, however, both the original and generalized Chaplygin gas models have
been extensively studied as alternatives to dark energy and/or uniﬁed dark energy and
dark matter models (see, e.g., [42, 44, 47, 50, 53, 54]).

Now if we consider the background curvature energy density and isotropic pressure
terms deﬁned in Eqs. (8) and (9) above, in the constant-curvature limiting case, we
have

µR =

1
4

[R(f ′ + 1) − 2f ] = −pR .

(23)

This equation of state, with an eﬀective EoS parameter wR = −1, provides the
condition for an exponential (accelerated) expansion with a constant Hubble parameter.
The energy density µR (with its negative pressure pR) remains constant and can be
interpreted as playing the role of the cosmological constant Λ.

Considering the curvature ﬂuid as a manifestation of the Chaplygin gas with the

EoS (22), we obtain

pR = −µR = −

A
µα
R

,

which, using Eq. (23), leads to the o.d.e

R

f (R)
dR − 2f (R) + R = 4A

1

α+1 .

(24)

(25)

Chaplygin-gas Solutions of f (R) Gravity

Solving this o.d.e yields

f (R) = R + C1R2 − 2A

1

α+1

6

(26)

for an arbitrary (integration) constant C1. We note that the ΛCDM solution f (R) =
R − 2Λ is already a particular solution with C1 = 0 and A = Λα+1. In particular, if
α = 0, then A = Λ, from which, going back to Eq. (24), one concludes µR = Λ.

If we include the linearized Laplacian term in Eqs.

(8) and (9) and use the
a2 of the covariantly deﬁned Laplace-Beltrami operator ˜∇2 on (almost)

eigenvalue − k2
FLRW spacetimes

˜∇2R = −

k2
a2

R

for a comoving wavenumber k, we obtain the second-order o.d.e

B2Rf ′′(R) − Rf ′(R) + 2f (R) − R + 4A

1

α+1 = 0 ,

where here we have deﬁned

B2 ≡

4(2 + 3α)
3(1 + α)

k2
a2

.

The solution of Eq. (28) is given, for arbitrary constants C2, C3, by

f (R) = R+C2(cid:2)R2 − 2RB2(cid:3)+C3(cid:20)(R2 − 2RB2)Ei(cid:18)1, −

R

B2(cid:19) + (R − B2)B2e

(27)

(28)

(29)

R

B2(cid:21)−2A

(30)

which should reduce to the quadratic solution (26) for negligible values of B2, i.e., for
small ﬁrst-order contributions to the energy density and pressure terms.

3.2. Modiﬁed Chaplygin Gas

On the other hand, if one considers the modiﬁed Chaplygin gas (MCG) EoS [51, 55–61]

pR = γµR −

A
µα
R

,

then the resulting f (R) model generalizes to

f (R) = R + C4R2 − 2(cid:18) A

γ + 1(cid:19)

1

α+1

,

where C4 is an arbitrary integration constant.

(31)

(32)

The ΛCDM solution is a limiting case of this generalized model when C4 = 0 and

A = (γ + 1)Λα+1. In particular, if α = 0 = γ, then A = Λ.

Chaplygin-gas Solutions of f (R) Gravity

Following similar arguments as in the preceding subsection,

if we include the
linearized Laplacian contributions to the energy density and pressure, we get Eq. (28)
generalized to

B2Rf ′′(R) − Rf ′(R) + 2f (R) − R + 4(cid:18) A

γ + 1(cid:19)

1

α+1

= 0 ,

the solution of which can be given by

(33)

f (R) = R+C5(cid:2)R2 − 2RB2(cid:3)+C6(cid:20)(R2 − 2RB2)Ei(cid:18)1, −

R

B2(cid:19) + (R − B2)B2e

R

B2(cid:21)−2(cid:18) A

γ + 1(cid:19)

(34)

1

α+1

,

for an arbitrary integration constants C5 and C6. This solution obviously generalizes
Solutions (26),(30) and (32) and should reduce to the quadratic solution (26) for
vanishingly small B2 values. In [62], it has been shown that any quadratic Lagrangian
leading to an isotropic, homogeneous cosmological model takes the form

f (R) = R − 2Λ −

βR2 ,

1
6

(35)

where β is an arbitrary, real constant. If we keep only the quadratic solution in (34),
i.e., if we set C6 = 0, the Lagrangian (35) corresponds to the choice

C5 = −

1
6

β , B = 0 , A = (γ + 1)Λα+1 .

(36)

Another interesting fact worth pointing out here is that the condition for the existence
of a maximally symmetric vacuum solution in f (R) gravity [62]

R0f ′(R0) = 2f (R0)

leads to the equation the quadratic solution resulting in the constraint

(37)

(38)

γ + 1(cid:19)
R0(cid:0)1 − 2C5B2(cid:1) − 4(cid:18) A

1

α+1

= 0 .

The corresponding GR de Sitter, anti-de Sitter and Minkowski solutions R0 = 4Λ
(respectively for Λ > 0 , Λ < 0 and Λ = 0) are obtained when C5B2 = 0 and
A = (γ + 1)Λα+1.

4. Discussions and Conclusion

In this paper we have explored models of f (R) that have Chaplygin gas equations of
state. We started with the assumption that the eﬀective energy density and isotropic
(8) and (9), sourced by the energy-momentum tensor of the
pressure terms of Eqs.
curvature ﬂuid (7), satisfy the equation of state of the Chaplygin gas, both in its
original (Eq. 22) and generalized (Eq. 31) forms. We then reconstructed, for time-
independent Ricci scalar, the f(R) Lagrangians that allow such equations of state. When
only background (zeroth-order) terms are considered for the energy density and pressure,
we notice that the eﬀective equation of state is wR = −1, and hence we naturally get
f (R) models that are quadratic in R but have limiting ΛCDM solutions.

On the other hand, keeping the ﬁrst-order (Laplacian of R) terms in the energy
density and pressure of the curvature ﬂuid results in the eﬀective energy density picking
up linearized corrections to -1. The resulting linearized second-order o.d.es in f (R)
result in more generalized solutions including exponential integral terms, of which the
quadratic Lagrangians are but a subset of solutions. These solutions also include ΛCDM
as a limiting solution.
