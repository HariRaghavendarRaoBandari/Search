ABSTRACT

Heavily obscured accretion is believed to represent an important stage in the growth of supermassive
black holes, and to play an important role in shaping the observed spectrum of the Cosmic X-ray
Background (CXB). Hard X-ray (E>10 keV) selected samples are less aﬀected by absorption than
samples selected at lower energies, and are therefore one of the best ways to detect and identify
Compton-thick (CT, log N H ≥ 24) Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). In this letter we present the ﬁrst
results of the largest broad-band (0.3–150 keV) X-ray spectral study of hard X-ray selected AGN to
date, focusing on the properties of heavily obscured sources. Our sample includes the 834 AGN (728
non-blazar, average redshift z ≃ 0.055) reported in the 70-months catalog of the all-sky hard X-ray
Swift/BAT survey. We ﬁnd 55 CT AGN, which represent 7.6+1.1
−2.1% of our non-blazar sample. Of these,
26 are reported as candidate CT AGN for the ﬁrst time. We correct for selection bias and derive the
intrinsic column density distribution of AGN in the local Universe in two diﬀerent luminosity ranges.
We ﬁnd a signiﬁcant decrease in the fraction of obscured Compton-thin AGN for increasing luminosity,
from 46 ± 3% (for log L 14−195 = 40 − 43.7) to 39 ± 3% (for log L 14−195 = 43.7 − 46). A similar trend
is also found for CT AGN. The intrinsic fraction of CT AGN with log N H = 24 − 25 normalised to
unity in the log NH = 20 − 25 range is 27 ± 4%, and is consistent with the observed value obtained
for AGN located within 20 Mpc.

1. INTRODUCTION

Brightman & Ueda 2012).

An obscured phase in the accretion history of super-
massive black holes (SMBHs) is believed to represent
a key step in the coevolution of Active Galactic Nuclei
(AGN) and their host galaxies. This phase could be as-
sociated with a period of rapid SMBH accretion, and
be part of an evolutionary scenario that starts with ma-
jor galaxy mergers and ends with an unobscured SMBH
(e.g., Sanders et al. 1988; Treister et al. 2012).

Understanding the distribution of obscuration in AGN
is also very important to fully comprehend the ori-
gin of the Cosmic X-ray background (CXB), which is
due to the unresolved emission of AGN, and there-
fore is imprinted with the accretion history of the Uni-
verse. Synthesis models of the CXB (e.g., Ueda et al.
2003; Treister & Urry 2005; Ballantyne et al. 2006;
Gandhi et al. 2007; Gilli et al. 2007; Treister et al. 2009;
Akylas et al. 2012; Ueda et al. 2014; Comastri et al.
2015) have shown that a signiﬁcant fraction of Compton-
thick (CT,
log NH ≥ 24) AGN are needed to repro-
duce the CXB. The intrinsic fraction of CT AGN (fCT)
is however still highly uncertain, and spans from ∼
10% to ∼ 40% of the total AGN population (e.g.,

Detecting and identifying CT AGN can be observa-
tionally challenging. At low redshift one of the best
approaches is to use hard X-ray surveys (E & 10 keV),
since the ﬂux in this energy band is less aﬀected by
obscuring material than at lower energies, at least up
to column densities of NH ∼ 1024 cm−2 (Fig. 1). At
high redshift it is possible to observe the rest-frame
hard X-ray emission in the soft X-ray (< 10 keV)
band, and recent deep surveys carried out with Chan-
dra and XMM-Newton in the 0.3–10 keV range (e.g.,
COSMOS, Chandra deep ﬁeld south) have been able
to ﬁnd a considerable number of CT AGN at z & 1
(e.g., Georgantopoulos et al. 2013, Vignali et al. 2014,
Lanzuisi et al. 2015, Buchner et al. 2015).
In the local
Universe hard X-ray detectors such as the Burst Alert
Monitor (BAT, Barthelmy et al. 2005) on board Swift
(Gehrels et al. 2004),
IBIS/ISGRI on board INTE-
GRAL (Winkler et al. 2003) and FPMA/FPMB on
board NuSTAR (Harrison et al. 2013) are therefore
well suited to detect and classify CT AGN. Swift/BAT
has been scanning the sky in the 14–195 keV band
since 2005, and given its complete coverage of the
sky it can be used to infer the population charac-
teristics of
local heavily obscured AGN. However,
previous works carried out both with Swift/BAT
and INTEGRAL have reported only a handful of
CT AGN (e.g., Paltani et al. 2008; Ajello et al. 2008;
Beckmann et al. 2009; Malizia et al. 2009; Burlon et al.
2011; Ajello et al.
2013a).
Pointed NuSTAR observations have been very eﬃ-
cient in classifying and characterising CT AGN (e.g.,
Balokovi´c et al. 2014, Gandhi et al. 2014, Ar´evalo et al.
2014, Bauer et al. 2014, Koss et al. 2015, Lansbury et al.

Ricci et al.

into account possible ﬂux variability between the soft X-
ray observations and the 70-months averaged hard X-ray
emission. Additional Gaussian lines were included to re-
move possible residuals in the iron region or below 4 keV.
In order to better constrain the column density and in-
trinsic ﬂux, AGN with N H consistent with ≥ 1024 cm−2
within their 90% uncertainties were then ﬁtted with
the physical torus model of Brightman & Nandra (2011),
which considers absorption and reﬂection for a spherical-
toroidal geometry. If statistically required, we added to
this model a scattered component, additional Gaussian
lines, a cross-calibration constant and collissionally ion-
ized plasma. Depending on the number of counts χ2
(∼ 700 AGN) or Cash (∼ 130 AGN) statistic were used
to ﬁt the X-ray spectra. Throughout this work we as-
sume a cosmological model with H0 = 70 km s−1 Mpc−1,
Ωm = 0.3 and ΩΛ = 0.7. The spectral models used have
been well tested in the past (e.g., Gandhi et al. 2014;
Balokovi´c et al. 2014; Lansbury et al. 2015) and follows
our rich experience in dealing with X-ray spectra of AGN
(e.g., Ricci et al. 2014; Bauer et al. 2014; Gandhi et al.
2014; Koss et al. 2015). Given the homogeneous ap-
proach used for the spectral modelling, our sample is
extremely well suited for future multi-wavelength stud-
ies.

In Table 1 we report the list of the 55 AGN identi-
ﬁed as CT from our study (i.e., with a best-ﬁt column
density of log N H ≥ 24), the 26 sources classiﬁed here
for the ﬁrst time as candidate CT by means of X-ray
spectroscopy are marked in boldface. The values of the
parameters listed in the table were obtained by using the
torus model of Brightman & Nandra (2011), as described
above. The table also reports the values of the Fe Kα
EW and of the photon index (Γ2−10) obtained by ﬁtting
the observed 2–10 keV spectrum with a simple power law
model. Both these parameters are diagnostics of heavy
obscuration: the Fe Kα EW is enhanced by the depletion
of the X-ray primary emission due to the line-of-sight ab-
sorption, while the measured continuum in the 2–10 keV
band is much ﬂatter than in unobscured AGN due to the
larger inﬂuence of the reprocessed X-ray emission from
distant material. For NGC 1068 and NGC 3079 we cal-
culated Γ2−10 in the 3–10 keV range to reduce the strong
inﬂuence of the radiative recombination continuum. All
CT sources show a 2–10 keV X-ray continuum signiﬁ-
cantly ﬂatter than typical unobscured or Compton-thin
AGN (Γ ∼ 1.8, e.g. Vasudevan et al. 2013a). The table
also reports the value of the photon index (Γ) obtained
by our broad-band X-ray ﬁt. The values of N H we ob-
tained for previously-known CT AGN are in agreement
with previous works carried out by using physical torus
models (e.g., Gandhi et al. 2014 and references therein,
Koss et al. 2015; Balokovi´c et al. 2014; Brightman et al.
2015). Details on the data reduction and ﬁtting pro-
cedure, together with discussion on the individual CT
sources, will be reported in the X-ray catalogue (Ricci et
al. in prep.).

3. COMPTON-THICK AGN AND THE COSMIC X-RAY

BACKGROUND

Observational constraints on the fraction of CT sources
are of fundamental importance to discern between dif-
ferent synthesis models of the CXB. With our study
we found that 55 sources have best-ﬁt column densities

Figure 1. Observed 14-195 keV ﬂux versus column density for
the template spectral model of Ueda et al. (2014), assuming Γ =
1.8 and an half-opening angle of the torus of θ OA = 35◦ and
θ OA = 60◦. The ﬂuxes are normalised to the value obtained for
log N H = 22. The ﬁgure illustrates the attenuation curve expected
for Swift/BAT.

2015, Annuar et al. 2015, Puccetti et al. 2015), although
the sample of these heavily obscured AGN observed so
far is still rather small.

Our group has recently carried out the largest study
of broad-band X-ray emission of AGN (Ricci et al.
in prep.), analysing in detail the 0.3–150 keV spectra
of the 834 AGN reported in the latest release (70-
months, Baumgartner et al. 2013) of the Swift/BAT cat-
alog (Sect. 2). We present here the ﬁrst results of our
work, focused on the detection of 55 CT AGN, 26 of
which are reported for the ﬁrst time as candidate CT
sources. We discuss our results in the framework of CXB
synthesis models (Sect. 3), and use them to constrain the
intrinsic NH distribution and the intrinsic fraction of CT
AGN (Sect. 4).

2. SAMPLE AND X-RAY SPECTRAL ANALYSIS

Our total sample contains the 834 AGN reported in
the 70-months Swift/BAT catalog (Baumgartner et al.
2013), of which 106 are blazars. Blazars were identiﬁed
based on the Rome BZCAT (Massaro et al. 2015) and on
recent literature. In the following we will refer only to
the 728 non-blazar AGN. The sample is local, with an
average redshift z ≃ 0.055. We collected the best X-ray
data below 10 keV available as of March 2013, using spec-
tra from XMM-Newton, Chandra, Suzaku, Swift/XRT
and ASCA. We also examined the X-ray spectra of the
∼ 60 objects reported as unknown in the Swift/BAT cat-
alog (i.e. without a clear identiﬁcation), and found that
none of these objects show typical characteristics of CT
AGN. Obscured AGN were ﬁtted with a model that in-
cludes:
i) a primary X-ray emission source in the form
of an absorbed cutoﬀ power-law; ii) an unobscured re-
ﬂection component (using a slab reﬂection model9); iii)
a scattered component in the form of a cutoﬀ power-
law, which parameters were ﬁxed to those of the pri-
mary X-ray emission. This component was scaled by a
constant (f scatt), which was left free to vary and had a
typical value of a few percent; iv) a Gaussian to repre-
sent Fe Kα emission line; v) emission from collissionally
ionized plasma; vi) a cross-calibration constant to take

Figure 2. Fraction of CT sources predicted by diﬀerent synthe-
sis models of the CXB versus 10–40 keV ﬂux limit. The value
of f CT obtained by this work is reported together with those ob-
tained by the 9-months Swift/BAT survey (in the 14–195 keV band;
Tueller et al. 2008) and by NuSTAR [8–24 keV (Alexander et al.
2013) and 3–24 keV band (Civano et al. 2015)]. The two models
reported in Akylas et al. (2012) consider a total fraction of CT
AGN of 15% and 25%. The plot shows that our results are in
good agreement with the CXB models of Treister et al. (2009),
Akylas et al. (2012) and Ueda et al. (2014).
NH ≥ 1024 cm−2, which represent 7.6% of our hard X-ray
selected sample. The number of CT AGN ranges from
40–63 (5.5–8.7%) when 90% conﬁdence errors on the col-
umn density are considered. Therefore the fraction of
CT AGN of our sample is f CT = 7.6+1.1
−2.1%. This fraction
would be at most ∼ 0.6% lower if all the objects reported
as unknown in the Swift/BAT catalog were found to be
non-blazar AGN.

The new CT AGN are located on average at higher red-
shifts compared to previously known hard X-ray selected
CT sources (z = 0.042 vs. 0.017). A Kolomogorov-
Smirnov (KS) test gives a p-value of ∼ 0.2% that the
two samples are drawn from the same distribution. The
newly detected CT AGN have on average higher lu-
minosities (log L14−150 = 44.23 vs. 43.87, KS p-value
of ∼ 10%) compared to previously known CT sources.
The average values of the photon indices are consis-
tent between the two populations (Γ = 2.09 ± 0.05 vs.
Γ = 2.06±0.05, KS p-value of ∼ 86%). While the average
values of the column density of newly identiﬁed CT AGN
(log NH = 24.59) is consistent with that of previously
known CT AGN (log NH = 24.63), their distribution are
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent (KS p-value of ∼ 1%), with the dis-
tribution of new CT AGN peaking at lower values of the
column density. In an independent search for Compton-
thick AGN, Koss et al. (in prep.) selected objects from
the Swift/BAT catalog via their spectral curvature at
E > 14 keV, and follow-up NuSTAR observations have
conﬁrmed their CT nature. We have checked our sam-
ple and found that all of our suggested CT objects at
z ≤ 0.03 show similar high energy curvature, validating
this technique for ﬁnding CT AGN.

Synthesis models of the CXB include diﬀerent assump-
tions on the cutoﬀ energy of the primary X-ray emis-
sion, of the intensity of the reﬂection component, and
on the intrinsic fraction of CT sources10. The inten-

(i.e. absorption-corrected) 14–150 keV ﬂux. Panel B: Intrinsic 14–
150 keV luminosity (top panel) and observed fraction of CT sources
(bottom panel) versus distance for the AGN located within 100 Mpc.
The decrease of the observed CT fraction with the decreasing in-
trinsic ﬂux and the increasing distance is due to the observational
bias of the Swift/BAT survey against sources with log N H > 24.
In both panel A and B the empty and ﬁlled points represent the
fraction of AGN with log N H = 24 − 25 and log N H = 25 − 26,
respectively. The red dashed line shows the intrinsic fraction of
sources with log N H = 24 − 25 (27 ± 4%, see Sect. 4), while the red
dotted line is the associated uncertainty.

sity of the reprocessed X-ray emission in particular plays
a rather important role in the predicted values of f CT
(Treister et al. 2009; Ricci et al. 2011; Vasudevan et al.
2013b). The model of Treister et al. (2009) takes into ac-
count reﬂection from a slab using the pexrav model with
a reﬂection parameter of R = 1.2; Akylas et al. (2012)
consider the same spectrum for reprocessed X-ray radi-
ation (with R ∼ 1), and take in account absorption by
considering an X-ray source located at the centre of a uni-
form spherical distribution of matter. Ueda et al. (2014)
consider reprocessed X-ray emission from the molecu-
lar torus by using an X-ray spectral model obtained by
Monte Carlo simulations (Brightman & Nandra 2011),
taking into account also disk reﬂection (using pexrav).

Ricci et al.

Ueda et al. (2014) argue that assuming a strength of the
Compton hump produced by the disk of R disk = 0.25
or R disk = 1 would change the best estimate of f CT
by as much as 50%. The signiﬁcantly higher fraction
of CT AGN predicted at low ﬂuxes by the model of
Ueda et al. (2014) (Fig. 2; i.e., a factor of ∼ 3 at F10−40 =
10−15 erg cm−2 s−1 with respect to Treister et al. 2009) is
related to the increase in the fraction of obscuration at
higher redshifts considered by the authors.

In Figure 2 we illustrate the fraction of CT sources
predicted by diﬀerent synthesis models of the CXB as a
function of the 10–40 keV ﬂux limit. The ﬁgure shows the
values of f CT obtained by our work, by Alexander et al.
(2013) and Civano et al. (2015) using NuSTAR, and by
Tueller et al. (2008) for the 9-months Swift/BAT cata-
log. The Swift/BAT 70 months survey has a ﬂux limit
of ∼ 10−11 erg s−1 cm−2 in the 14–195 keV energy band,
which corresponds to 4.3 × 10−12 erg s−1 cm−2 in the 10–
40 keV band (for a power-law emission with a photon
index of Γ = 1.8). The observed value of f CT we ﬁnd is
in good agreement with that predicted, for the ﬂux limit
of the 70-months Swift/BAT survey, by Treister et al.
(2009) and Ueda et al. (2014), and with the two models
of Akylas et al. (2012) that consider an intrinsic fraction
of CT AGN of 15% and 25%.
In agreement with the
results of Tueller et al. (2008), we ﬁnd that the model
of Draper & Ballantyne (2010) and of Gilli et al. (2007)
clearly overestimate (by a factor of ∼ 2) the fraction
of CT AGN for the ﬂux-limit we probe in the 10–40 keV
band. The value of f CT obtained by Civano et al. (2015)
combining NuSTAR detections in the 3–8, 8–24 and 3–24
keV band is larger than the value predicted by the mod-
els consistent with Swift/BAT measurements. This could
be related to the large uncertainties associated with the
estimation of N H from hardness ratios.

4. THE INTRINSIC COLUMN DENSITY DISTRIBUTION

Due to the signiﬁcant eﬀect of Compton scattering for
NH > 1024 cm−2 even hard X-ray selected samples can
be biased against CT AGN (see Fig. 1).
In particular
only a few objects with log NH & 24.5 are detected by
Swift/BAT. In these reﬂection-dominated AGN the pri-
mary X-ray emission is almost completely depleted and
they are observed only through their reﬂection compo-
nent. The eﬀect of this observational bias is clearly il-
lustrated in Fig. 3, which shows how the observed value
of f CT inferred from our sample changes with the intrin-
sic ﬂux and the distance. Within 20 Mpc the fraction of
CT AGN is f CT = 32 ± 11%, while this value clearly
decreases with increasing distance, and is below 10% at
D & 80 Mpc.

To derive the intrinsic NH distribution of AGN one
must carefully correct the observed distribution (bottom
panel of Fig. 4) for selection biases. Besides absorption,
the reﬂection components from the torus and accretion
disk also aﬀect the selection eﬃciency of AGN at hard X-
rays. We follow the same analysis as in Ueda et al. (2003,
2014) to constrain the “NH function” [f (LXi, zi; NHi)],
which represents the probability distribution function of
line-of-sight column density of an AGN. Since it is ex-
tremely diﬃcult to constrain the number of AGN with
log N H > 25, the NH function is normalized to unity
in the range between log NH = 20–24 (completely un-
absorbed AGN are arbitrarily assigned log NH = 20.0).

Figure 4. Top panel: NH function of our hard X-ray selected
AGN sample (normalised to unity in the log NH = 20–24 range)
for a torus with an half-opening angle of θ OA = 60◦. Central
panel: same as top panel for a torus with an half-opening angle of
θ OA = 35◦. Bottom panel: observed column density distribution
(normalised to unity in the log NH = 20–24 range). The plots
show the values for 14–195 keV luminosities in the log L 14−195 =
40 − 43.7 and log L 14−195 = 43.7 − 46 range. Objects with little
or no absorption were assigned log NH = 20.

Thanks to the large sample size, we do not assume any
functional shape for the NH function, but treat the values
in discrete bins of log NH as independent, free parame-
ters. We perform a maximum-likelihood ﬁt of the ab-
sorption function using the likelihood estimator deﬁned
by Ueda et al. (2014):

L′ = −2 X ln

where i represents each object of the sample, and A is the
survey area (from Baumgartner et al. 2013) per count

trinsic 14–195 keV luminosity L X = L 14−195 and redshift
z. Since we are interested in the local Universe we limited
the redshift range to z < 0.3. The values of NH obtained
by our broad-band spectroscopical work have typically
small uncertainties, therefore we only refer to the best-
ﬁt value of NH of each AGN. Due to the diﬃculty of well
constraining the column density of reﬂection-dominated
AGN, we excluded from the sample the four most heavily
Compton-thick AGN, which are likely to have log NH >
25. We obtained the count rate through the luminosity
distance and the detector response by assuming the tem-
plate X-ray spectra of Ueda et al. (2014), which considers
both disk and torus reﬂection and assumes a cutoﬀ en-
ergy of E C = 300 keV. The latter is taken into account
using the model of Brightman & Nandra (2011), ﬁxing
the torus opening angle at 60◦.

The NH function obtained is shown in the top panel
of Figure 4 for two luminosity bins. The number ra-
tio between CT AGN with log NH = 24 − 25 and ab-
sorbed Compton-thin AGN (log NH = 22 − 24) is es-
timated to be 62 ± 10% from the entire sample. We
ﬁnd a decrease in the fraction of obscured Compton-
thin AGN for increasing luminosities as found by several
previous studies (e.g., Beckmann et al. 2009), with the
N H function going from 68 ± 4% for the low-luminosity
bin (log L 14−195 = 40 − 43.7) to 50 ± 4% for the high-
luminosity one (log L 14−195 = 43.7 − 46). The N H func-
tion at log NH = 24 − 25 has also a signiﬁcantly higher
value in the low-luminosity bin (f = 47 ± 10%) than in
the high-luminosity one (f = 30 ± 3%). Normalizing the
N H distribution to unity in the log NH = 20 − 25 range
we obtain that the fraction of obscured Compton-thin
sources decreases from 46 ± 3% (log L 14−195 = 40 − 43.7)
to 39±3% (log L 14−195 = 43.7−46), while the fraction of
CT AGN with log N H = 24 − 25 is 32 ± 7% and 21 ± 5%
for the low and the high luminosity bin, respectively. The
fraction of CT AGN with log N H = 24 − 25 for the whole
sample is 27±4%. This value is larger than that predicted
at low z by Aird et al. (2015), but is in very good agree-
ment with that inferred by Burlon et al. (2011) (20+9
−6%)
using a smaller sample of ∼ 200 Swift/BAT selected
AGN.

The correction factors we calculated to reproduce the
intrinsic number of CT AGN depend on the geometry
of the absorbing and reprocessing material. To illus-
trate this eﬀect we show in the central panel of Fig. 4 the
NH function obtained assuming a torus opening angle of
θ OA = 35◦. While the population of Compton-thin AGN
is unchanged, adopting this geometry we found that the
number ratio between CT AGN with log NH = 24 − 25
and absorbed Compton-thin AGN (log NH = 22 − 24)
is 36 ± 5% for the whole sample, lower than the value
obtained for θ OA = 60◦. Similarly to what we ob-
tained for θ OA = 60◦, we found that the N H function
at log NH = 24 − 25 has a signiﬁcantly higher value in
the low-luminosity bin (f = 27 ± 6%) than in the high-
luminosity one (f = 15 ± 4%). Normalizing the N H dis-
tribution to unity in the log NH = 20−25 range we found
that the fraction of CT AGN with log N H = 24 − 25 is
22 ± 4% and 13 ± 3% for the low and high-luminosity bin,
respectively, and 17 ± 3% for the whole sample.

The fraction of obscured Compton-thin AGN of our
sample signiﬁcantly decreases with increasing luminos-

ity. This trend has been explained with the decrease of
the covering factor of the circumnuclear material with
the luminosity, possibly due to radiation pressure (e.g.,
Lusso et al. 2013 and references therein). We also ﬁnd
signiﬁcant evidence for a luminosity-dependence of the
fraction of CT sources, both assuming θ OA = 60◦ and
θ OA = 35◦. Studying NuSTAR observations of 10 AGN,
Brightman et al. (2015) recently found possible evidence
of a strong decrease of the covering factor of the torus
with the luminosity (f CT ∝ −0.41 log L2−10), similarly
to what was found for Compton-thin objects. At higher
redshifts Buchner et al. (2015) found instead that the
fraction of CT AGN is compatible with being constant
with the luminosity.

5. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In this work we report the ﬁrst results obtained by the
largest study of hard X-ray selected AGN to date, which
includes the 834 AGN of the 70-months Swift/BAT cat-
alog. We ﬁnd 55 CT AGN, which represents 7.6+1.1
−2.1%
of the total population of non-blazar objects. We ﬁnd
the ﬁrst evidence of CT obscuration in 26 objects, in-
creasing considerably the number of hard X-ray selected
CT AGN at low redshift. The observed fraction of
CT AGN we infer for the ﬂux limit of the Swift/BAT
survey is in agreement with the recent CXB synthesis
models of Treister et al. (2009), Akylas et al. (2012) and
Ueda et al. (2014).

We reconstruct the intrinsic column density distribu-
tion of AGN and ﬁnd that the fraction of obscured
Compton-thin AGN (log NH = 22 − 24) varies between
∼ 46% (for log L 14−195 = 40 − 43.7) and ∼ 39%
(log L 14−195 = 43.7 − 46). We also ﬁnd a decrease in the
fraction of CT AGN for increasing luminosity. We show
that the intrinsic fraction of CT AGN with log N H =
24 −25 normalised to unity in the log NH = 20 −25 range
is 27 ± 4%. This is consistent with the observed value ob-
tained for AGN located within 20 Mpc (see Fig. 3), which
shows that a signiﬁcant fraction of AGN in the local Uni-
verse are heavily obscured.

Future NuSTAR observations of nearby AGN, selected
for example by their [OIII] emission, will allow to de-
tect the CT AGN missing from the Swift/BAT survey.
At the same time deep NuSTAR observations are ex-
pected to resolve ∼ 30% of the integrated ﬂux of the
CXB (Ballantyne et al. 2011), and will shed light on the
fraction of CT sources at lower ﬂux levels, which will
allow to even better discriminate between diﬀerent syn-
thesis models of the CXB.

Note. — The table reports the (1) Swift ID, (2) counterpart name, (3) optical classiﬁcation, (4) redshift, (5) value and 90% conﬁdence interval of the column density, (6) Fe Kα EW,
(7) photon index obtained by ﬁtting the spectrum in the 2–10 keV range with a power-law, (8) photon index obtained by ﬁtting the 0.3–150 keV spectrum (see Sect. 2), (9) 2–10 keV
and (10) 14–150 keV intrinsic (i.e. absorption and k-corrected) luminosities, and (11) X-ray observatory used for the soft X-ray spectra (CA=Chandra/ACIS; SuX=Suzaku/XIS;
SX=Swift/XRT; XE=XMM-Newton/EPIC). The optical classiﬁcations are taken from the Swift/BAT Spectral Survey (BASS paper I, Koss et al. in prep.) unless stated otherwise.
BASS will report the optical characteristics of more than 500 BAT selected AGN. Dots are reported when no optical classiﬁcation is available. Newly identiﬁed CT AGN are reported
in boldface.
A Sources reported to be CT by Koss et al. (in prep.) thanks to NuSTAR observations.
B Sources reported to be Compton-thin by previous works due to the narrower energy band used for the X-ray spectral analysis.
C Swift/BAT ﬂux due to the combined emission of NGC 6921 and MCG +04−48−002. The 14–150 keV luminosity reported refers only to NGC 6921
1 Optical classiﬁcation from the literature.

Fe Kα line not detected because of the low signal-to-noise ratio of the Swift/XRT observation.
