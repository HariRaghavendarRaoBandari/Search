We construct a practical method for ﬁnding optimal Gaussian probe states for the estimation of
parameters encoded by Gaussian unitary channels. This method can be used for ﬁnding all optimal
probe states, rather than focussing on the performance of speciﬁc states as shown in previous studies.
As an example, we apply this method to ﬁnd optimal probes for the channel that combines the phase-
change and squeezing channels, and for generalized two-mode squeezing and mode-mixing channels.
The method enables a comprehensive study of temperature eﬀects in Gaussian parameter estimation.
It has been shown that the precision in parameter estimation using single mode states can be
enhanced by increasing the temperature of the probe. We show that not only higher temperature,
but also larger temperature diﬀerences between modes of two-mode probe states can enhance the
estimation precision.

INTRODUCTION

In recent years, the interest in quantum technologies
has increased since this research area is in the brink of
reaching the commercialisation stage.
Important theo-
retical and experimental eﬀorts are underway to exploit
quantum properties, such as squeezing and entanglement,
in the development of a new generation of sensors that
improve on the precision of their classical counterparts
by orders of magnitude [1]. However, there is still sub-
stantial work to be done improving on the capability for
preparing certain states, on the protection of states from
decoherence, on being able to implement speciﬁc mea-
surements and on ﬁnding optimal probe states to achieve
the highest possible sensitivity. In this paper we develop
a practical method for ﬁnding optimal probe Gaussian
states, which are a family of states that are very accessi-
ble in experiments.

In quantum metrology probe states are quantum states
used to optimally estimate an unknown parameter of
a quantum channel. A quantum channel is a transfor-
mation that can be unitary or correspond to a com-
plete positive map in the case where the system interacts
with the environment. The typical strategy is simple [2]:
The probe state is fed into the channel, the channel en-
codes the parameter on the state of the system and, ﬁ-
nally, measurements are performed with the aim of gain-
ing maximal information about the parameter. Given a
quantum channel, some probe states are aﬀected more
than others, i.e., they are more sensitive. Channels of in-
terest in this paper are Gaussian channels, which trans-
form a Gaussian state into another Gaussian state. Find-
ing the optimal family of probe states for a given channel

is one of the main tasks of quantum metrology. The aim
is to achieve the Heisenberg limit, which is the optimal
rate at which the accuracy of a measurement can scale
with the energy stored in a probe state.

Gaussian states are usually not optimal probe states.
However, previous theoretical studies show that they can
be eﬀectively used for the estimation of Gaussian chan-
nels such as phase-changing [3–6], squeezing [7–9], two-
mode squeezing and mode-mixing channels [9]. Previous
studies analysed speciﬁc channels and for each channel
only one probe state achieving the Heisenberg limit was
found. Gaussian state metrology is often restricted to
pure states. Less attention has been given to thermal
states, which are of great relevance in practice. In the
laboratory, quantum states can never be isolated from
the environment which thermalises the states.
In this
paper we develop a formalism that can be eﬀectively
used to study any Gaussian probe state for any one-
and two-mode Gaussian unitary channels and methods
to ﬁnd all optimal Gaussian probe states for these chan-
nels. We take advantage of recent developments in the
phase-space formalism of Gaussian states [10–16], mak-
ing use of Euler’s decomposition of symplectic matrices,
the Williamson decomposition of the covariance matrix
in the complex form, and expression for the quantum
Fisher information in terms of the Williamson decompo-
sition [15]. These techniques enable us to simplify ex-
pressions so that formulae can be easily used in practical
applications. As an example, we derive optimal states
for channels that, to our knowledge, have not been opti-
mised before. These are the channel combining the phase
change and squeezing, and generalized mode-mixing and
two-mode squeezing channels. Interestingly, we ﬁnd that
in the estimation of two-mode channels, separable states
consisting of two one-mode squeezed states perform as
well as their entangled counterpart: two-mode squeezed
states. This shows that entanglement between the modes

does not enhance precision in this case.

Our formalism also enables us to further our under-
standing of the eﬀects of temperature in probe states.
It has been reported in [4] that higher temperature in
squeezed thermal states can enhance phase estimation,
while higher temperature of displaced thermal states is
detrimental. We show that the eﬀects of thermalised
probe states on the estimation of Gaussian channels are
generic. I.e., for all Gaussian unitary channels, temper-
ature eﬀects are always manifested in multiplicative fac-
tors of four types. Two of the factors correspond to the
ones previously found in [4]. The other two – newly dis-
covered – factors show that not only temperature of the
probe state, but also temperature diﬀerence between dif-
ferent modes of the probe state helps the estimation.

The article is organised as follows. We ﬁrst introduce
the phase-space formalism for Gaussian states, Gaussian
unitary channels, and techniques for the optimal esti-
mation of channel parameters. We present a general
framework to ﬁnd optimal probe states for any Gaus-
sian unitary channel and we study the eﬀects of temper-
ature on the estimation strategy. We apply our formal-
ism to present concrete examples for one- and two-mode
Gaussian unitary channels and generalize bounds on the
precision of estimation found in [3, 4, 7–9]. In the con-
cluding section we discuss the Heisenberg and the shot-
noise limits of our results. Three appendices are included
providing details on the phase-space description of Gaus-
sian unitary channels (appendix A), relevant characteris-
tics of the channels (appendix B), and general results for
the estimation of two-mode squeezing and mode-mixing
channels using a wide class of two-mode probe states (ap-
pendix C).

II. QUANTUM METROLOGY ON GAUSSIAN

STATES

The main aim of quantum metrology is to provide tech-
niques to estimate as precisely as possible a physical pa-
rameter encoded in a quantum state. In this section we
review techniques that provide lower precision bounds in
the estimation of parameters encoded in Gaussian states.
This is done more conveniently using the phase-space de-
scription of Gaussian states and Gaussian unitary oper-
ators. We consider a system consisting of N Bosonic
†
modes. The operators ˆan and ˆa
n annihilate and create
particles, respectively, in each mode. In the phase-space
description of the system the operators are collected in

vector ˆA∶=(ˆa1, . . . , ˆaN , ˆa

)T . The commutation

correspond to the ﬁrst and second moments of the ﬁeld,
respectively. The density operator ˆρ speciﬁes the state

of the ﬁeld and{⋅,⋅} denotes the anti-commutator. The
terms of the vector ∆ ˆA∶= ˆA− d. We emphasise that, to

covariance matrix is a positive-deﬁnite matrix given in

simplify calculations, we choose to use deﬁnitions in the
complex form, while most authors use the real form. For
more details on their equivalence see appendix B or [15,
18].

Gaussian states are deﬁned as states that are fully
characterized by their ﬁrst and second moments, while
more general states require higher ﬁeld moments in their
description. Gaussian transformations correspond to uni-
taries ˆU that transform Gaussian states into Gaussian
. These operators are generated via an
exponential map with the exponent at most quadratic in
the ﬁeld operators [17],

The above identities together with transformation re-

The Williamson decomposition can be used, for ex-
ample, to fully parametrize Gaussian states of a given
number of modes. Any symplectic matrix (7) can be de-
composed using Euler’s decomposition as [17, 18]

where U1 and U2 denote unitary matrices, and Mr =
diag(r1, . . . , rN) is the diagonal matrix of the squeezing

parameters. With a full parametrization of unitary ma-
trices U1 and U2, one can use this decomposition to fully
parametrize the covariance matrix via Eq. (8). Moreover,
since the displacement vector is fully parametrized by
its elements, we have a full parametrization of Gaussian
states. Note, however, that some parameters may not
add any additional complexity and can be removed. This
is a consequence of the fact that in Eq. (8) some parts of
(the decomposition of) U2 vanish, because they commute

with the diagonal matrix diag(λ1, . . . , λN). We explicitly

write the most general one-mode Gaussian state in sec-
tion IV, and the most general two-mode Gaussian state
in section V.

One of the main aims of quantum metrology is to ﬁnd
the ultimate precision limits on the estimation of a phys-
ical parameter  encoded in a quantum state. This is
given by the quantum Cram´er-Rao bound [2, 22],

(∆ˆ)2≥

(10)

which gives a lower bound on the mean squared error of
the locally unbiased estimator ˆ. M denotes the number
of measurements taken on identical copies of the state

ˆρ(), and H() is a quantity called quantum Fisher in-

formation. The quantum Fisher information says how
precisely we can estimate an unknown parameter  in a
single-shot experiment. For the Williamson decomposi-
tion (8) of the covariance matrix of a Gaussian state, the
quantum Fisher information reads [15],

in optimizing over the preparation stage for a given encoding

In the estimation of quantum channels we are some-
times interested in the scaling of the Quantum Fisher in-
formation with the mean number of particles in a probe
state. If the quantum Fisher information scales quadrat-
ically with n, we say the Heisenberg limit is achieved [1],
which signiﬁes a use of quantum resources. In contrast,
the linear scaling of the quantum Fisher information is
called the shot-noise limit, which can usually be achieved
by classical methods.

III. GENERAL FRAMEWORK

In this section we provide a framework for studying the
optimal Gaussian states for the estimation of Gaussian
unitary channels. This task is illustrated on ﬁgure 1.

erations we are going to perform on this thermal state.
After the probe state is created, we feed it into a Gaussian
channel encoding the parameter we want to estimate.

Although the method we are going to describe can
be easily used to estimate any Gaussian unitary chan-
nel (3), for simplicity we consider only channels with
purely quadratic generators represented by a single sym-
plectic matrix S. These are obtained from Eq. (3) by

setting γ= 0. For completeness we also consider a post-

processing represented by the symplectic matrix Sp and
the change of displacement dp. Given the scheme, we can
ask: “What is the optimal probe state for the channel we
want to estimate? ” To answer that question, we optimize
over the preparation stage to ﬁnd an initial thermal state
D0, the symplectic transformations S0, and the displace-
ment d0 such that the sensitivity of the resulting probe
state to the channel is maximised.

Using Eqs. (5) we ﬁnd the ﬁnal state is given by the

ﬁrst and the second moments

The optimal state is the one which maximises the quan-
tum Fisher information (11). As the covariance matrix
appears precisely in the form of the Williamson decom-
position, we can use formula (11) directly. Applying
Eqs. (7), (12), and (13), we derive

P= S

where we have denoted ˜P∶= S−1
we can therefore assume Sp= I and dp= 0. This scheme
be written as a one-parameter symplectic group S= eX,
case ˜P= X, and the quantum Fisher information is inde-

˙S. Due to the unitarity
of the channel the symplectic eigenvalues do not change,
and the expression (14b) vanishes. Both Eqs. (14a) and
(14c) are independent of the post-processing Sp and dp,

where X is an element of the Lie algebra deﬁned by
Eq. (12) and is independent of the parameter . In that

can be used for any channel S. However, in the following
sections we are going to study those channels which can

pendent of . The problem of ﬁnding the optimal states is
thus reduced to ﬁnding the optimal parameters from the
parametrization of the initial state for a given Gaussian
channel represented by a constant matrix X.

It is interesting to note that the symplectic eigenvalues
in Eq. (11) appear only in a form of multiplicative fac-
tors, independent of other parameters and channels we
estimate. This is particularly interesting from a physical
point of view, because the symplectic eigenvalues encode
a temperature. The symplectic eigenvalue describing a
thermal state of the harmonic oscillator with frequency ωi

is given by λi= coth( ωi
where nthi∶= tr[ˆni ˆρth], ˆni= ˆa

First, let us study the eﬀects of temperature on the es-
timation from the change of the diagonalizing symplectic
matrices given by matrices R and Q. In Eq. (11) we gen-
erally have three types of multiplicative factors. The ﬁrst
one,
, is the only one to appear for the isothermal
(sometimes called isotropic) states for which all symplec-
tic eigenvalues are equal. This class also encompasses all

pure states. Because 1≤ λi≤+∞, we have 1

where the lower bound is attained by pure states and the
upper bound by thermal states with inﬁnite temperature.
This means that for isothermal states temperature helps
the estimation with the maximal enhancement by a fac-
tor of two, a fact already noted in [4]. On the other hand,
for mixed multi-mode states we have two more elements,

(λi−λj)2
(λi+λj)2
λiλj−1 and
λiλj+1 . These terms become especially
symplectic eigenvalues. Considering λj→ 1 we have

.

This shows that the enhancement by temperature diﬀer-
ence is no longer bounded by some ﬁxed value like in the
previous case.

If we keep one mode suﬃciently cool and the other
hot, or if one has a high frequency and the other has
a low frequency, we can, in principle, achieve an inﬁ-
nite enhancement in the estimation of the unknown pa-
rameter. This suggests a connection between quantum
metrology and thermodynamics, since modes with larger
temperature diﬀerence have a higher ability to perform
work. There is also a possible connection to the infor-
mation theory through the Landauer’s principle. States
with large variance in energy, which is in our case in a
form of temperature, have higher ability to carry infor-
mation, and thus ability to carry more information about
the parameter we want to estimate. We will refer to this
phenomenon as temperature-enhanced estimation.

As we have shown, temperature enhances the ﬁrst two
terms in Eq. (11), which corresponds to the change of
the rotation and squeezing of the probe state. How-
ever, the opposite behaviour is observed in the last term,

which corresponds to the change of displacement. This
is because the element (14c) depends on the inverse of
the initial covariance matrix, and the dependence on the
symplectic eigenvalues thus appear in the form of 1
. As
λi
temperature rises and the symplectic eigenvalues grow to
inﬁnity, the precision in estimation goes to zero. Physi-
cally, it is good to have a hot squeezed state as a quantum
probe, or a cool displaced state.

First we are going to study a general one-mode Gaus-
sian channel which combines both phase-change and
squeezing in an arbitrary direction. Results for the phase-
changing and squeezing channel will then be obtained as
special cases. We construct this general channel by sub-

stituting θ → ωθ, r → ωr to Eq. (17). The resulting
symplectic matrix S∶= eiKW then represents an encod-
ing operator ˆS= exp((−iωθˆa

ωθ and ωr are the frequencies with which the state is
rotated and squeezed respectively. We assume these fre-
quencies and the squeezing angle χ are known, so  is
the only unknown parameter we are trying to estimate.

this general state can be made, the results seem to be too

complicated to be used eﬀectively. Also, as the ﬁrst three
operations applied on the thermal state only swap and
entangle the symplectic eigenvalues, we do not expect
much generality will be lost when not considering them.
Moreover, in the case of the isothermal states (which also
covers all pure states), such operations do not have any
eﬀect. This is why we restrict ourselves to probe states
which we write in the covariance matrix formalism as

d0=(˜γ, ˜γ)T ,

(28b)

where D0= diag(λ1, λ2, λ1, λ2). Also, since using mixed

states cannot improve the quality of estimation when ﬁx-
ing the energy of the probe state, the optimal states are
always pure. As Eq. (28) encompasses all pure states, it
is enough to use this restricted class of states to ﬁnd the
optimal.

First we are going to study the optimal states for the

the state from Eq. (28) we ﬁnd only two cases which
lead to signiﬁcantly diﬀerent results.

a beam-splitter is not used (θ = 0) in the prepara-

sion for the quantum Fisher information is a mixture of
these two qualitatively diﬀerent cases and can be found
in appendix C.

the two-mode squeezed probe state.

The diﬀerence between formulae (33) and (34) is only
in the use of the displacement. Non-displaced probe
states reach the same precision independently of the sign
of the squeezing parameters. Maximizing the quantum
Fisher information for a ﬁxed amount of energy in the
probe state we arrive at the very same conclusions as in
the case of non-entangled states, i.e., the optimal state
is obtained when all energy is invested into squeezing
and squeezing parameters are equal, giving the same
Heisenberg limit. Here, however, the last part of the

expression,( d1 + d2 )2e2r2, combines the displacements
by the mixed term 2 d1  d2  which is not present when

using non-entangled probe states. This may be useful
if, for some reason, we want to squeeze only one of the
two modes (for example when the apparatus for creating
squeezed states is expensive or diﬃcult to build). Send-
ing a coherent state in the other mode then enhances the
estimation in a non-linear way.

and subtracting Eq. (30) from Eq. (33), we obtain

Now, let us see whether it is more eﬀective to use an en-
tangled state or two one-mode squeezed states as a probe
for the estimation of the two-mode squeezing channel.
To do that we compare the precision of estimation where
beam-splitter has and has not been used in the prepara-

tion process. Assuming both modes are pure, λ1= λ2= 1,

3. Using one-mode Gaussian states

In the previous sections we considered two-mode Gaus-
sian probe states for the estimation of two-mode chan-
nels. But is probing them with the two-mode states really
necessary? What precision could be achieved by using
only the one-mode state as a probe? Mathematically, we
represent such one-mode Gaussian probes by a two-mode
Gaussian state where the ﬁrst mode is the most gen-
eral single-mode state and the second mode is vacuum,

we show the case when a beam-splitter has been used in

have been used instead.
In contrast to the two-mode
squeezing channel, where the optimal probe state always
depended on the squeezing angle χ, here we identify a
universal probe state which achieves the optimal scaling
for any mode-mixing angle χ. The full expression for the

that entanglement in the probe state is necessary to
achieve the Heisenberg limit, and why this reasoning is
not applicable in the continuous variable states known as
Gaussian states.

Although there are many possible deﬁnitions of Heisen-
berg limit in quantum metrology [23],
in this paper
we adopt the deﬁnition where the precision of esti-
mation is compared to the mean energy of the probe
state, mean number of Bosons respectively. Sequence

This illustrates that under conditions (43) and (45), the
construction (44) using separable states cannot lead to
the Heisenberg limit and entangled states are necessary.
This follows the proofs from [24–26] showing that exis-
tence of entanglement in an m-qubit state is necessary
condition for the scaling of the quantum Fisher informa-
tion larger than the shot-noise limit.

Although 1-qubit Hilbert space, from which the m-
qubit Hilbert space is created, satisﬁes Eq. (43), such
condition is no longer satisﬁed by the Fock space repre-
senting a Bosonic system. There are states in the Fock
space, such as squeezed states and coherent states, which
can lead to an arbitrarily large precision in the estima-
tion. Therefore proof (46) does not apply anymore and
entanglement is not necessary. As shown in previous sec-
tions, separable states such as squeezed states can also
achieve the Heisenberg limit.

In comparison to m-qubit systems, which use entan-
glement as a resource, the resources in Bosonic systems
are rather highly superposed states spanning across all
inﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert space, while entanglement
does not play a signiﬁcant role anymore.

In this article we have exploited recent developments
in the theory of metrology and translated the problem of
optimal estimation into the more convenient phase-space
formalism. This allowed us to systematically study wide
classes of Gaussian states for the estimation of Gaussian
unitary channels. Using this approach we managed to
ﬁnd optimal states for the most common channels.

We found that for every channel we studied the optimal
states are either squeezed or two-mode squeezed states.
Further, the entanglement of the probe state does not
play any signiﬁcant role, which corresponds to the ﬁnd-
ings of [9, 27]. This is not in contradiction with some
previous studies showing that entanglement is necessary
to achieve the Heisenberg limit [25, 26], because assump-
tions taken there do not apply anymore to the Fock space
describing a Bosonic system.

In estimating parameters of phase-changing, one-mode
squeezing, mode-mixing, and two-mode squeezing chan-
nels ( ˆR, ˆS, ˆB, ˆST respectively), the quantum Fisher infor-

mation reaches the Heisenberg limits

HR()= 2 sinh2(2r)= 8n(n+ 1),
HS()= 2 cosh2(2r)= 2(2n+ 1)2,
HB()= 4 sinh2(2r)= 4n(n+ 2),
()= 4 cosh2(2r)= 4(n+ 1)2,

where r denotes the squeezing of one of the modes in the
probe state, and n is the mean total number of particles
of the probe state. These results generalize the precision
bounds found in [3, 4, 7–9].

Alternatively, if we choose coherent states as probe

states, we obtain the shot-noise limits

HR()= 4n,
HS()= 2(2n+ 1),
HB()= 4n,
()= 4(n+ 1).

These are the same limits we ﬁnd when using any one-
mode state to probe two-mode Gaussian channels.

Authors of [4] showed that temperature of the probe
state may enhance the estimation precision by a factor of
two, and authors of [9] explored of how temperature acts
in the estimation of mode-mixing channels. We demon-
strated that eﬀects of temperature are generic. Indepen-
dent of which Gaussian unitary channel is probed, the
eﬀects of temperature always come in multiplicative fac-
tors of four types. The ﬁrst three appear when the chan-
nel changes the squeezing or the orientation of squeezing
of the probe state. The ﬁrst one accounts for the absolute
number of thermal Bosons in each mode and corresponds
to the one found in [4]. Two of them take into account
diﬀerences between thermal Bosons in each mode. Larger
diﬀerences then lead to higher precision in the estimation,
while the enhancement factor scales with the ratio of the
number of thermal Bosons nthi
nthj

, for nthi â nthj â 0.
The last factor is of the form(2nthi+ 1)−1 and appears

when the Gaussian channel changes the displacement of
the probe state.

The main goal of this article was to show how diﬀer-
ent aspects of the probe states aﬀect the estimation, and
to provide a framework that can be eﬀectively used to
study optimal probe states for the construction of new-
era quantum detectors.
In addition to applications for
existing gravitational wave detectors [28, 29], our results
may be useful for designing new gravimeters [30–32], cli-
mate probes [33], or for the estimation of space-time pa-
rameters [34–36].

To reduce the amount of confusion caused by diﬀer-
ent authors using diﬀerent notations, we write what the
symplectic matrices look like in the notation introduced
by Eq. (2), and in one type of the so-called real form of
the covariance matrix. Deﬁning vectors of position and

momenta operators ˆQ∶=(ˆx1, . . . , ˆxN , ˆp1, . . . , ˆpN)T , where
ˆxi∶= 1√

ment and the real form covariance matrix are deﬁned as

(ˆa
+ ˆai), ˆpi∶= i√
dRi= trˆρ ˆQi
σRij= trˆρ{∆ ˆQi, ∆ ˆQj
= SRσRST

where ∆ ˆQ∶= ˆQ− dR. The real form covariance matrix
mation as σ′

then transforms under the real form symplectic transfor-
R. Symplectic matrices in most
other commonly used notations are simply obtained
by rearranging some rows and columns of either the
complex (2) or the real form matrices (B1). One-mode
operations which leave the other modes invariant are
easily lifted into two-mode operations by adding iden-
tities onto suitable places. For more information about
the transformation between the real and the complex
form see for example [15, 18].

Let us assume the most general Gaussian unitary from

Because ˆU is the Gaussian unitary, the transformation
