ABSTRACT

Context. The origin of the enormous luminosities of the two opaque nuclei of Arp 220, the prototypical ultra-luminous
infrared galaxy, remains a mystery because we lack observational tools to explore the innermost regions around the
nuclei.
Aims. We explore the potential of imaging vibrationally excited molecular emission at high angular resolution to better
understand the morphology and physical structure of the dense gas in Arp 220 and to gain insight into the nature of
the nuclear powering sources.
Methods. The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) provided simultaneous observations of HCN,
HCO+, and vibrationally excited HCN v2 = 1f emission. Their J = 4 − 3 and 3 − 2 transitions were observed at a
matching resolution of ∼ 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48), which allows us to isolate the emission from the two nuclei.
Results. The HCN and HCO+ lines within the ground-vibrational state poorly describe the central ∼ 100 pc region
around the nuclei because there are strong eﬀects of cool absorbing gas in the foreground and severe line blending that
is due to the proliﬁc molecular emission of Arp 220. Vibrationally excited emission of HCN is detected in both nuclei
with a very high ratio relative to the total LF IR, higher than in any other observed galaxy and well above what is
observed in Galactic hot cores. HCN v2 = 1f is observed to be marginally resolved in ∼ 60 × 50 pc regions inside the
dusty ∼ 100 pc sized nuclear cores. Its emission is centered on our derived individual nuclear velocities based on HCO+
emission (VW N = 5342 ± 4 and VEN = 5454 ± 8 km s−1, for the western and eastern nucleus, respectively). With virial
masses within r ∼ 25 − 30 pc based on the HCN v2 = 1f line widths, we estimate gas surface densities (gas fraction
fg = 0.1) of 3 ± 0.3 × 104 M(cid:12) pc−2 (WN) and 1.1 ± 0.1 × 104 M(cid:12) pc−2 (EN). The 4 − 3/3 − 2 ﬂux density ratio could
be consistent with optically thick emission, which would further constrain the size of the emitting region to > 15 pc
(EN) and > 22 pc (WN). The absorption systems that may hide up to 70% of the HCN and HCO+ emission are found
at velocities of −50 km s−1 (EN) and 6, −140, and −575 km s−1(WN) relative to velocities of the nuclei. Blueshifted
absorptions are the evidence of outﬂowing motions from both nuclei.
Conclusions. Although vibrationally excited molecular transitions could also be aﬀected by opacity, they may be our
best tool to peer into the central few tens of parsecs around compact obscured nuclei like those of Arp 220. The bright
vibrational emission implies the existence of a hot dust region radiatively pumping these transitions. We ﬁnd evidence
of a strong temperature gradient that would be responsible for both the HCN v2 pumping and the absorbed proﬁles
from the vibrational ground state as a result of both continuum and self-absorption by cooler foreground gas.

can be hindered by extreme obscuration (Av > 1000) that is
due to the large amounts of intervening dust. This obscura-
tion can hide the central power source at most wavelengths.
Molecular emission has been exploited as an alternative way
to circumvent this limitation as its rotational transitions
spanning the mm and submm wavelength ranges are less
aﬀected by obscuration. However, even using these emis-
sion lines we may have diﬃculties to peer into the most ob-
scured and compact nuclei such as those found in Arp 220,
the closest prototypical ULIRG. Therefore, we need to ex-
plore new tools and/or tracers to study the central regions
of such elusive objects.
The two nuclei within the advanced merger system of
Arp 220, separated by ∼ 1” (∼ 370 pc for D = 76 Mpc),
are surrounded by two high column density counterrotating
gas disks that heavily obscure their inner nuclear regions
(Sakamoto et al. 1999). These nuclei are optically thick
outside of the 5 − 350 GHz frequency range as a result
of free-free and dust absorption at low and high frequen-
cies (Barcos-Muñoz et al. 2015). Although they have been
the target of studies covering all available wavelengths for
decades, the origin of the ∼ 1012L(cid:12) stemming from Arp 220
remains an unanswered question, with arguments suggest-
ing an active galactic nucleus (AGN) and/or a starburst
origin (see references in Wilson et al. 2014; Tunnard et al.
2015; Barcos-Muñoz et al. 2015). Even the many molecu-
lar transitions that have been detected and imaged at high
resolution (Martín et al. 2011, and references therein) have
not been able to provide a deﬁnitive answer. Nevertheless,
at the highest resolution achieved with mm and submm
interferometry, Arp 220 reveals new unexpected features
such as the P-Cygni proﬁles revealed by HCO+ and SiO
(Sakamoto et al. 2009; Tunnard et al. 2015), and possibly
maser HNC emission (Aalto et al. 2009).

The recent advent of ALMA therefore led diﬀerent
groups to redirect their focus back to Arp 220 in an ultimate
eﬀort to reveal its nuclear power source (Wilson et al. 2014;
Rangwala et al. 2015; Scoville et al. 2015). However, a new
obstacle was found in the form of line absorption features
that erase the molecular emission from the very central re-
gions. This absorption does not only aﬀect the CO emission
(Rangwala et al. 2015), but also dense gas tracers such as
HCN, HCO+, and CS (Scoville et al. 2015; Aalto et al.
2015b), as well as their rarer isotopic substitutions (Tun-
nard et al. 2015), which were so far always regarded as a
solution for optical thickness aﬀecting the main isotopologs.
Thus it becomes essential to ﬁnd and target species
and/or transitions that are only created and excited within
the nuclear region and are absent in the outer and colder
gas structures, which veil our capacity to study these elu-
sive regions.

During the past few years, a number of studies have re-
vealed vibrationally excited transitions of HCN and HC3N
in extragalactic sources. This emission has only been de-
tected toward some nearby obscured nuclei, namely the
LIRG NGC 4418, and the ULIRGs Arp 220, IRAS20155-
4250, and Mrk 231 (Sakamoto et al. 2010; Costagliola &
Aalto 2010; Costagliola et al. 2013, 2015; Martín et al.
2011; Imanishi & Nakanishi 2013; Aalto et al. 2015a). Vi-
brationally excited levels can be eﬃciently pumped through
mid-IR photons from hot gas with dust temperatures Td >
100 K (Sakamoto et al. 2010; Aalto et al. 2015b). These
levels have therefore been claimed to be a powerful tool to

isolate the innermost regions associated with these heavily
obscured nuclei.

In this paper we present the ﬁrst spatially resolved imag-
ing of the vibrationally excited emission in the two nuclei of
Arp 220. These observations also clearly locate the absorp-
tion complexes aﬀecting the dense gas tracers HCN and
HCO+ in their vibrational ground-state transitions. To-
gether with the detected continuum, we study the physical
structure of the two nuclei.

2. Observations
The observations were carried out with ALMA in its Cycle
1 as part of a spectral line survey of Arp 220 (Martín et al.
in preparation). In this paper we report the measurements
covering HCN and HCO+ in their J = 3 − 2 (261.152 GHz
and 262.794 GHz) and J = 4 − 3 (348.194 GHz and
350.383 GHz) transitions, as well as the corresponding
v2 = 1 transitions of HCN (see Sect. 3.3 for details). These
sky frequencies are redshifted, adopting z = 0.018126.

Band 6 observations were carried out on July 8, 2014,
with 31 antennas. The correlator was conﬁgured on each
sideband with 2 × 1.875 GHz spectral windows overlap-
ping by 100 MHz. The resulting two 3.65 GHz bands
were centered on the sky frequencies 247.1 and 262.5 GHz.
J1550+0527, Titan, and J1516+1932 were used as band-
pass, ﬂux, and gain calibrators. The median system tem-
perature was 80 K during the observations. The spectral
resolution of 0.488 MHz was degraded by 48 channels to a
velocity resolution of ∼ 27− 28 km s−1. The short snapshot
with 2.5 minutes of on-source integration resulted in an rms
of 1.1-1.3 mJy beam−1 at the smoothed resolution.

Band 7 observations were carried out in two separate
snapshots on April 27 (34 antennas) and May 27, 2014 (31
antennas). The correlator was conﬁgured similarly to band
6, but the two bands were centered on the sky frequen-
cies 336.8 and 348.7 GHz. Calibrators were the same as
those for band 6. Median system temperatures were 210
and 140 K at 336.8 and 348.7 GHz, respectively. The reso-
lution was degraded by 60 channels to a velocity resolution
of ∼ 25 − 26 km s−1. The total on-source integration of
7.2 minutes resulted in an rms of ∼ 1 mJy beam−1 per
smoothed channel.

In both bands, ﬂux calibration used the Butler-JPL-
Horizons 2012 models. Regions aﬀected by emission line in
the Titan data were excluded. Flux accuracy is expected to
be better than 10 − 15%.
The phase center of the observations was αJ2000 =
15h34m57s.271, δJ2000 = 23◦30(cid:48)10(cid:48)(cid:48).480, which is oﬀset by
∼ 1(cid:48)(cid:48) in declination from the position of the Arp 220 nuclei
(Sect. 3.1). The similar uv-coverage in both bands resulted
in matching ∼ 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48) synthesized beams (Table 1).

Continuum subtraction was performed in the uv visibil-
ities. Line contribution to the continuum emission has been
shown to be a problem in Arp 220 (Martín et al. 2011),
where the spectra are confusion limited because of both
the proliﬁc molecular emission and broad line widths. This
becomes even more of a problem at high frequency, as has
also been observed toward the LIRG NGC 4418 (Costagli-
ola et al. 2015), and it hinders ﬁnding line-free spectral
regions to extract continuum information. Although the
spectral lines presented in this paper were observed in the
upper sideband of the two setups, we used the continuum
windows available in both bands to better account for the

spectral index (α ∼ 3) at these frequencies. For each of
the four 3.65 GHz bands, we selected regions that we esti-
mated to be free of molecular emission based on both vi-
sual inspection and spectroscopic catalogs. The aggregated
(non-continuous) bandwidth used to estimate the contin-
uum emission is indicated in Table 1. The frequencies indi-
cated for each continuum measurement represent the aver-
age frequency of the ranges we used, and therefore do not
match the center of the observed bands. About 15− 25% of
the total bandwidth was usable for continuum subtraction
(except for the lower sideband of band 6 where only 5% of
the band was estimated to be line free). A ﬁrst-order lin-
ear ﬁt to the continuum emission was used individually for
bands 6 and 7.

The data were calibrated and deconvolved using CASA

release 4.2.1 (McMullin et al. 2007).

3. Results
3.1. Continuum emission
In Table 1 we present the total integrated continuum ﬂuxes
derived for each individual observed band. Continuum im-
ages of each band are shown in Fig. 1.

The good signal-to-noise ratio of the observations al-
lowed ﬁtting a double Gaussian in the image plane to the
two nuclei. Results are presented in Table 2. The relative
positions of the nuclei can be determined with an accu-
racy of ∼ 0.02(cid:48)(cid:48). The positions derived for all bands agree
within the uncertainties. Based on the measurement in our
band 7 data, we derive positions of the continuum peaks
at αJ2000 = 15h34m57.223s, δJ2000 = 23◦30(cid:48)11.53(cid:48)(cid:48)
for
the western nucleus (WN) and αJ2000 = 15h34m57.293s,
δJ2000 = 23◦30(cid:48)11.38(cid:48)(cid:48) for the eastern nucleus (EN). These
positions agree with the many estimates in the literature
(see Fig. 3 in Scoville et al. 2015). The measured source
sizes in band 6 of the compact components agree well with
the sizes derived by Wilson et al. (2014), but they are still
marginally resolved at our resolution.

Continuum emission is signiﬁcantly detected outside the
compact structures around the nuclei. As an estimate of the
amount of extended emission compared to that enclosed in
the nuclei, Table 1 shows the ratio between the overall emis-
sion integrated within the central ∼ 4(cid:48)(cid:48) (∼ 1.5 kpc) and that
extracted from the Gaussian ﬁts. We derive that ∼ 8% of
the emission is extended in band 7. Our continuum mea-
surements agree with those in the literature (see references
in Matsushita et al. 2009). As discussed by Sakamoto et al.
(2008), single-dish observations result in a total ﬂux density

at 345 GHz ranging from 0.7−0.8 Jy. While Sakamoto et al.
(2008) considered that the CO contribution could add up
to 11% of the bolometric observations, we now know that
overall molecular emission could account for up to > 20%
in Arp 220 (Martín et al. 2011). Thus we can conclude that
the our ALMA observations recover all the continuum ﬂux
density. At 247 GHz, extended emission only accounts for
3% of the total emission, which is due to the lower sensi-
tivity in this band as a result of the limited line-free region
available for continuum measurement (Table 1).

3.2. HCN and HCO+
Despite the short snapshot observations, line emission of
HCN and HCO+ in the J = 3− 2 and J = 4− 3 transitions
is detected at unprecedentedly high signal-to-noise ratio of
up to ∼ 300.
In Fig. 2 we show the intensities integrated over the
central 800 km s−1 of each transition. Similar to what is
observed in the integrated intensity of CO 6−5 at high reso-
lution (Rangwala et al. 2015), we observe an oﬀset between
the peak of molecular emission and the continuum, which is
more evident toward the WN in both the HCN and HCO+
J = 4 − 3 transitions. The measured diﬀerences of ∼ 0.04(cid:48)(cid:48)
are most likely due to the eﬀect of the absorption systems
(Sect. 3.2.2) in their integrated CO map. Indeed, Rangwala
et al. (2015) concluded from their kinematic models that
this oﬀset in CO is only apparent.

Figure 3 shows the spectral proﬁles of the four tran-
sitions extracted from the positions of the two nuclei de-
ﬁned as the peak of continuum emission in Sect. 3.1. The
velocities we report here are referenced to z = 0.018126,
which correspond to VLSR = 5434 km s−1
(optical) or
5337 km s−1 (radio). We refer to this as the systemic ve-
locity (Vsys) of Arp 220 and use the radio convention of
velocities throughout the paper. The individual systemic
velocities of each nucleus are denoted as VEN and VW N.
Figure A.1 shows integrated maps for each of the four
transitions in ranges of 200 km s−1 between −600 and
600 km s−1. Position velocity diagrams in the direction of
the velocity gradient of each nucleus (P.A. = 30◦ and 115◦
for EN and WN, respectively) are presented in Fig A.2. The
directions of the cuts are also indicated by blue arrows in
Fig. 2.

3.2.1. Line blending
Line blending in Arp 220 is severe and cannot be neglected
(Martín et al. 2011). While emission from vibrationally ex-
cited HCN is discussed in Sect. 3.3, we here discus the pos-
sible contamination from other lines close to the HCN and
HCO+ lines.

From the Arp 220 and NGC 4418 line surveys (Martín
et al. 2011; Costagliola et al. 2015) we know that the com-
pact obscured nuclei in these sources present large abun-
dances of HC3N, which contribute to their spectra with
transitions every ∼ 9 GHz, together with a comb of vibra-
tionally excited transitions. In the frequency range studied
here, we ﬁnd the HC3N 38 − 37 transition at 354.7 GHz.
From the physical conditions derived by Martín et al.
(2011), we infer for this line a peak ﬂux density integrated
over the whole source of ∼ 20−40 mJy within the uncertain-
ties. We can therefore roughly estimate peak ﬂux densities

of ∼ 10−20 mJy if they are equally divided between the nu-
clei. Thus it will slightly contribute to the blueshifted side
of HCN 4− 3 of the EN, and right at one of the absorption
systems (Sect. 3.2.2) in the WN. This contribution will be
even stronger if a warm HC3N component (Tex > 40 K) is
present, as seems to exist in the ALMA data for NGC 4418
(Costagliola et al. 2015). Contribution from vibrationally
excited transitions of HC3N are expected to be about half
of the peak ﬂux of the ground-state transitions (Martín
et al. 2011). We note that, as discussed in Sect. 3.3.1, and

depending on the relative spatial distribution, the emission
from this species might be fully absorbed by foreground
optically thick HCN and thus does not contribute to the
observed HCN proﬁle.
The bump observed at the blueshifted side of HCN 3−2
toward the WN and less prominently toward the EN might
be due to the CH2NH 41,3 − 31,2 transition at 266.3 GHz.
This feature is better identiﬁed in the narrower spectral
lines observed in the LIRGs IC860 and Zw49-57 presented
by Aalto et al. (2015b). However, this has to be conﬁrmed

The apparent absorption peaks are highlighted with ver-
tical dashed lines in Fig. 3. However, to infer the actual
central velocity of the absorption features, we also have to
account for the contribution from the emission proﬁle.
To characterize the absorption proﬁles, we use the
HCO+ 3− 2 transition, which is the least aﬀected by blend-
ing and also fully covered by the bandwidth of our observa-
tions. We assumed a Gaussian shape for the HCO+ emis-
sion and performed a ﬁt to the unabsorbed channels, while
masking those where the absorption is observed. After sub-
tracting the emission proﬁle, we ﬁt the individual absorp-
tions. We note that these numbers are highly dependent
on the line proﬁle of the emission, but we considered the
Gaussian as the best approach at the current resolution.
For this reason, we do not refer to the statistical errors of
the ﬁts since they are not meaningful. In Fig. A.3 we show
the multi-Gaussian ﬁt performed to the HCO+ 3−2 proﬁles
that are discussed in the following.
Toward the EN, the central velocity of the absorp-
tion appears at V − Vsys = −5 ± 4 km s−1
and a line
width of ∼ 250 ± 10 km s−1. The HCO+ 3 − 2 Gaussian
ﬁt to the unabsorbed channels yields a central velocity of
∼ 117 ± 8 km s−1 and width ∼ 290 ± 10km s−1. Because
of this line emission, the absorption proﬁle is shifted to
∼ 70 km s−1 with a narrower width of ∼ 210km s−1. Thus
only one absorption component is observed in the EN at
V ∼ 5410km s−1.
Toward the more complex WN, the apparent veloci-
ties of the absorptions are at V − Vsys = −150 ± 8 and
20± 5 km s−1 with widths of 210± 30 and 126± 9 km s−1,
respectively. The Gaussian ﬁt to the HCO+ 3 − 2 emis-
sion is centered on ∼ 5 ± 4 km s−1 with a width of
∼ 386 ± 10 km s−1. After subtracting this proﬁle, the
absorption lines appear to be centered on ∼ −135 and
11 km s−1 with widths of 210 and 130 km s−1, respectively.
Our corrected blueshifted absorption agrees better with the
average velocity centroid of −110 ± 10 km s−1 (relative to
z = 0.018126) measured with several HCN IR absorption
proﬁles (González-Alfonso et al. 2013), which supports our
result and thus the assumption of an underlying Gaussian
emission proﬁle.
Additionally, we detect a broad absorption proﬁle cen-
tered on V − Vsys = −570 ± 20km s−1 and with a width of
∼ 170 ± 40km s−1 only toward the WN. This feature was
previously observed with the SMA also in HCO+ 3 − 2
(Sakamoto et al. 2009) and more recently in SiO (Tun-
nard et al. 2015). This means that a total of three ab-
sorption systems are identiﬁed at VLSR,radio ∼ 4767, 5202,
and 5348 km s−1. Although they are present in the SMA
data from Sakamoto et al. (2009), the absorption of the
three proﬁles shows a similar depth in their data, while in
the ALMA data the absorption close to the systemic ve-
locity is signiﬁcantly deeper than the other two. Moreover,
while the disagreement between the two central absorptions
can be attributed to the diﬀerent quality of the data and
the ﬁtting to the proﬁles, the extreme blueshifted absorp-
tion reported at 4890 km s−1 by Sakamoto et al. (2009) is
∼ 120 km s−1 closer to the Arp 220 systemic velocity than
in our ALMA data.
We did not detect any trace of redshifted absorption in
either HCN or HCO+ such as that reported for CO 6 − 5

ﬁcation in Arp 220.

3.2.2. Absorption systems

We observe clear absorption features that have previously
been identiﬁed in every high-resolution imaging of CO
(Downes & Eckart 2007; Sakamoto et al. 2008; Rangwala

A&A proofs: manuscript no. ALMAHCNHCOp

by Rangwala et al. (2015). Moreover, we did not observe
the bow shape in the integrated emission as seen in CO
6 − 5. Judging from the diﬀerences in the channel maps of
CO and those of HCN and HCO+, the attenuation of the
emission toward the SW side in the two nuclei could be due
to the redshifted material of lower density that is observed
in absorption in CO 6−5 (ncrit ∼ 105 cm−3, Rangwala et al.
2015) but not in the high-density tracers HCN and HCO+
(ncrit ∼ 106 and 107 cm−3, respectively, Shirley 2015).

3.2.3. Individual velocities of the nuclei (VW N and VEN )
Precise estimates of the systemic velocities of the individ-
ual nuclei are important parameters to determine whether
there are radial motions to or from the nuclei. Previous
estimates based on the CO proﬁles resulted in radio ve-
locities of VW N = 5355 ± 15 km s−1 and VEN = 5415 ±
15 km s−1 (Sakamoto et al. 2009).

High-density tracers probing an inner region can better
pinpoint the systemic velocity of the individual nuclei. The
ﬁt to the unabsorbed parts of the HCO+ 3 − 2 proﬁles
described in Sect. 3.2.2 and shown in Fig. A.3 can be used as
a good approximation. The velocity oﬀsets of V − Vsys ∼ 5
and ∼ 117 km s−1 found for the WN and EN, respectively,
result in individual nuclear velocities of VW N = 5342 ±
4 km s−1 and VEN = 5454 ± 8 km s−1. Based on our data,
the velocity diﬀerence between the two nuclei is then 112±
9 km s−1. This result is consistent within the uncertainties
with that of Sakamoto et al. (2009) toward the WN, while
the EN velocity is ∼ 40 km s−1 above their estimate based
on CO.

A precise knowledge of the systemic velocity is a key
parameter in any attempt of modeling the kinematics of
the Arp 220 nuclei. The CO 6 − 5 kinematics in the EN
were modeled with an optically thick turbulent rotating
disk by Rangwala et al. (2015). In such a self-absorbing
disk model, absorption is expected to be centered on the
systemic velocity of the EN , which Rangwala et al. (2015)
estimated at 5345 km s−1. However, we showed that the ab-
sorption in the EN occurs at v ∼ 5410 km s−1 (Sect. 3.2.2),
which is blueshifted by 50 km s−1 from our derived VEN.
Toward the WN, we found one of the three absorption sys-
tems centered directly on the derived nuclear velocity with
V − VW N ∼ 6 km s−1
(with the other two blueshifted
to V − VW N = −140 and −575 km s−1). For the absorp-
tion systems in other compact and highly obscured galaxies,
Aalto et al. (2015b) assumed the absorption to be centered
on the systemic velocity, as expected from a uniformly dis-
tributed cold gas envelope. However, a close inspection of
the Arp 220 system may show that the absorption is pro-
duced by outﬂowing material close to the nuclear region
(see Sect. 4.2).

The full spectral scan (Martín et al. in preparation) is
expected to provide further constraints on the systemic ve-
locity of the two nuclei, with a large number of optically
thin lines with high critical densities less aﬀected by ab-
sorption eﬀects.

3.3. HCN v2 = 1 emission
So far, only Sakamoto et al. (2010) have presented the de-
tection of two transitions of HCN v2 = 1 toward NGC 4418.
We detected the emission of HCN J = 3− 2 (267.199 GHz)
Article number, page 6 of 14

and 4 − 3 (356.255) in its v2 = 1f vibrational state. The
latter has been reported toward the WN by Aalto et al.
(2015b). Here we report the emission clearly detected to-
ward the two nuclei in both transitions. Although we do not
report it there, HCN v2 = 1f emission can also be identi-
ﬁed in the SMA data from Sakamoto et al. (2009), whose
sensitivity is lower.
The HCN v2 = 1f transitions are separated by ∼
402 km s−1
from the HCO+ lines. Thus the vibrationally
excited line is signiﬁcantly blended with HCO+ toward the
WN and to a lesser degree with the redshifted HCO+ emis-
sion in the EN (Fig. 3). To ﬁt the emission of HCN v2 = 1f
in both nuclei, we followed two simple approaches. The re-
sults are presented in Table 3. First we ﬁt the redshifted
peak of HCO+ and the HCN v2 = 1f line with a double
Gaussian. This is indicated in Table 3 as double. However,
this ﬁt does not take into account the tail of redshifted emis-
sion observed in both HCN 3 − 2 and 4 − 3, which might
be also present in HCO+. This is particularly critical in the
WN. To account for a more realistic HCO+ line shape, we
subtracted a scaled-down proﬁle from HCN 3 − 2 to sub-
tract the HCO+ emission and then ﬁt the HCN v2 = 1f
emission to the residual. The possible contribution from
ν2 = 1e (Sect. 3.3.1) was not removed from the subtracted
HCN 3 − 2 proﬁle. The residuals after subtraction of the
assumed HCO+ proﬁle are shown in Fig 3 as dark gray
histograms. Results of the Gaussian ﬁt to these residuals
appear in Table 3 as subtracted. Although subtracting the
HCN 3− 2 proﬁle to account for HCO+ is highly uncertain,
the central velocities derived from the two HCN v2 = 1f
transitions show agree better than when derived from a
double Gaussian ﬁt. Only higher spatial resolution obser-
vations will be able to accurately determine the line proﬁle
of the vibrational emission of HCN.
If our de-blending method is correct, the vibrational
emission appears to be redshifted by 15 ± 11 and 22 ±
9 km s−1 with respect to the derived nuclear velocities VW N
and VEN (Sect. 3.2.3), respectively. At our spectral resolu-
tion and ﬁt accuracy, this is consistent with this emission
being centered on the individual nuclear velocities. These
velocities support the scenario that vibrational emission
traces the innermost regions around the nuclei (Sect. 5.1).

3.3.1. Contribution of v2 = 1e to the HCN v = 0 proﬁle
Based on its spectroscopic parameters, the emission of the
v2 = 1e transitions at 265.853 GHz (J = 3 − 2) and
354.460 GHz (J = 4 − 3) are expected to have similar ﬂux
densities as those of the v2 = 1f lines. These v2 = 1e tran-
sitions appear at ∼ +38 km s−1
from the center of the
HCN ground-vibrational transitions, thus possibly aﬀect-
ing its proﬁle. Assuming a similar emission to the v2 = 1f
ﬁtted proﬁles, we have estimated the contribution of this
emission to the v = 0 proﬁles at the two nuclei. In Fig. 3
the estimated v2 = 1e proﬁles are shown as pale gray lines.
The residual HCN v = 0 after subtracting the estimated
contribution from the v2 = 1e is shown as white lines.

However, we note that the proﬁles presented in Fig. 3
correspond to the limit case in which the v2 = 1e contribu-
tion is not attenuated by foreground material. Indeed, the
v2 = 1e line may be partially or totally absorbed by the
foreground HCN ground transition. In this case, no contri-
bution to the observed proﬁle would be observed. Vibra-
tional emission might escape if HCN were absorbing gas

S. Martín et al.: The unbearable opaqueness of Arp220

that is clumpy or not equally spatially distributed per ve-
locity bin, although the velocity oﬀset between the lines
might not be enough for the latter possibility. Because of
this uncertainty, we did not take the v2 = 1e contribution
into account to derive the HCN line proﬁle that was used
to de-blend HCO+ from the v2 = 1f lines (Sect. 3.3)

3.3.2. Gas surface densities in the Arp 220 nuclei
As discussed in Sect. 5.2, vibrational emission from HCN is
emerging from the very central 50 − 60 pc regions around
the two nuclei in Arp 220. This makes it an excellent probe
of the inner enclosed mass within the central few tens of
parsec.
The average FWHM derived from the two observed
transitions are 325 ± 25 km s−1 and 195 ± 15 km s−1 for
the WN and EN, respectively. If all the vibrationally
excited emission arises from within r ∼ 25 − 30 pc
(Sect. 5.2), we can estimate virial masses as (Mvir/M(cid:12)) =
250(∆v1/2/km s−1)2(R/pc) (Wilson et al. 2009) of MW N ∼
6 − 9 × 108 and MEN ∼ 2 − 3 × 108 M(cid:12). These val-
ues are an order of magnitude lower than the estimates
of ∼ 6 × 109 M(cid:12) within the central ∼ 100 pc of the two
nuclei (Engel et al. 2011). We note that if we were to cal-
culate the virial masses as Mvir = 3.36σ2R/G Engel et al.
(2011), our derived masses would be a factor of ∼ 2 lower.
These masses correspond to gas surface densities of 3 ±
0.3×104 M(cid:12) pc−2 (WN) and 1.1±0.1×104 M(cid:12) pc−2 (EN)
assuming a gas fraction fg = 0.1. These values are roughly
one order of magnitude lower than the values derived by
Barcos-Muñoz et al. (2015). Still, both nuclei may be close
to the maximal stellar surface density of ∼ 105 M(cid:12) pc−2
(Hopkins et al. 2010) for plausible higher gas fractions.

4. Dense gas absorption
4.1. Underestimated dense gas in compact obscured nuclei
As has been suggested from the CO 6− 5 observations from
Rangwala et al. (2015), absorption in Arp 220 severely af-
fects the dense gas observations. This is fully supported
by our observations of HCN and HCO+. However, we ﬁnd
that the peak of molecular emission in the HCN ground
state matches the continuum peak. Both the highest HCN
integrated intensity and the peak intensity are found at the
continuum peak position. These observations further prove
that the oﬀset between the continuum peak and the molecu-
lar peak seen in CO J = 2−1 (Downes & Eckart 2007), CO
J = 3 − 2 (Sakamoto et al. 2008, 2009), and CO J = 6 − 5
Rangwala et al. (2015) is due to the stronger eﬀect of the
absorption in CO than in HCN and HCO+.

If, as assumed in Sect. 3.2.2, we consider the real line
proﬁles of the ground-state transitions to be Gaussian in
shape, we estimate that on average ∼ 70% of the line pro-
ﬁles in the two Arp 220 nuclei could be absorbed. Under
the assumption of a 3D Gaussian distribution of the emis-
sion, where the extent of the line emission would be equal
to that of the absorption (which is not true, as seen in
Sect. 4.2), these 70% would be an absolute upper limit to
the absorbed total integrated ﬂux density. Although this
absorption is concentrated in the very central region, low-
resolution observations over ∼kpc scales still show these
absorbed proﬁles (Greve et al. 2009; Martín et al. 2011;
Aladro et al. 2015).

Absorption in dust-obscured nuclei such as those of
Arp 220 are clearly not an isolated case and might be sys-
tematically aﬀecting the most compact LIRGs and ULIRGs
(Aalto et al. 2015b). Absorbed proﬁles might result in re-
strictions to the use of HCN and HCO+ as probes of the
overall dense gas content in this type of galaxies and more
importantly restrict estimates of their star-forming eﬃcien-
cies (SFE) (Graciá-Carpio et al. 2008). Graciá-Carpio et al.
(2008) showed evidence of an enhancement of the dense gas
SFE, measured as the LFIR/L(cid:48)
HCN(1−0) ratio in a sample of
LIRGs and ULIRGs with respect to normal galaxies. Spec-
tra in their sample also showed a variety of line shapes with
ﬂat tops and dips in the proﬁle that were commonly at-
tributed to gas kinematics. If the line proﬁles from Graciá-
Carpio et al. (2008) are the result of cool gas foreground
absorption, their total amount of dense gas would be un-
derestimated by more than a factor of 2 in these galaxies,
and therefore the SFE would be overestimated. Although
this eﬀect would only be expected in the most compact ex-
treme objects, this uncertainty could result in a strong bias,
and caution should be applied on the higher end of galaxy
luminosities.

4.2. Origin and location of the absorption systems
Whether the absorption is due to self-absorption and/or
absorption of the continuum cannot be distinguished at
our 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48) resolution since both the continuum and the hot
dense gas material that is traced appear to be centered on
the same position. Self-absorption would require a strong
temperature gradient, which is present, as we can deduce
from the detection of vibrationally excited emission of HCN
(Sect. 5.2). However, the detection of HCO+ absorption be-
low the continuum level shows that a proﬁle like this is at
least partly due to absorption of the continuum.

To understand the origin of the absorption systems,
in Fig. 4 we image the absorption systems identiﬁed in
Sect. 3.2.2. Images are centered on the apparent velocities
of the absorptions and not on the corrected velocities (see
Sect. 3.2.2), where the absorption is contaminated by emis-
sion. We used the HCO+ 3 − 2 transition because it shows
absorption of the continuum, and therefore the location of
the absorption is more easily visualized. From Fig. 4 we ob-
serve that the absorption found closer to Vsys, toward both
the EN and WN, is located directly on top of the peak of
the continuum emission.
On the other hand, the absorption observed at V −
Vsys ∼ −150 km s−1
is marginally oﬀset by ∼ 0.05(cid:48)(cid:48)
(20 pc) southwest from the nuclear position. This absorbing
blueshifted gas most likely traces gas outﬂowing from the
WN.
Similarly, the absorption system at V − Vsys ∼
−570km s−1 also appears to be centered on the peak of con-
tinuum emission or just marginally south (cid:46) 0.05(cid:48)(cid:48) of this
position.
Toward the WN, Tunnard et al. (2015) found an oﬀset
of 0.1” between the location of the SiO J = 6 − 5 absorp-
tion and the emission in the WN close to systemic velocity.
This oﬀset was interpreted as a bipolar outﬂow, although it
may be partly caused by the location of the absorbing sys-
tem. From our HCN and HCO+ observations, the absorp-
tion at Vsys is dominated by the gas along the line of sight
with no sign of an oﬀset between the absorption and the

emission. The location of the emission of HCN and HCO+
(Fig. 4a) diﬀers from what Tunnard et al. (2015) observed
in SiO. This supports their idea that SiO is emitted in the
gas aﬀected by the putative outﬂow, but higher resolution
imaging is required to conclude about this question.
The absorption observed in HCN and HCO+ at V −
VW N ∼ 6 km s−1 is very likely related to the cooler struc-
ture in the outer regions of the WN that both self-absorbes
the molecular emission and absorbes the extended back-
ground continuum emission, but cannot be directly associ-
ated with outﬂowing gas. However, the blueshifted absorp-
tions at −140 and ∼ −575 km s−1
relative to VW N are
associated with high-velocity gas outﬂowing from the two
nuclei. Their oﬀsets with respect to the peak of the contin-
uum emission agree with the sketch proposed by Tunnard
et al. (2015), perpendicular to the plane of rotation of the
molecular disk.
For the high velocity ∼ −570km s−1 component, the
redshifted counterpart of the outﬂow might be responsible
for the line wing we observe in both HCN 3 − 2 (cropped
at the edge of the spectrum) and 4 − 3 toward the WN. As
shown in Fig. A.1, HCN emission in the 400−600 km s−1 in-
terval is oﬀset toward the north, as expected for a bipolar

outﬂow, and contrary to what is observed in HCO+ , where
the emission is dominated by the vibrationally excited HCN
emission. However, the line confusion aﬀecting this galaxy
prevents us from ﬁrmly conﬁrming this redshifted outﬂow
component at the current resolution. Thus, the absorption
observed in SiO close to systemic velocity (Tunnard et al.
2015) and the other absorption systems may all be related
to diﬀerent components of the same outﬂow aligned in the
northeast to southwest direction.

Toward the EN the absorption appears to be centered on
the peak of continuum emission, even though the absorption
is blueshifted by −50 km s−1
relative to VEN, which also
suggests outﬂowing material from this nucleus.

5. Vibrationally excited HCN
5.1. HCN excitation of vibrational levels
Based on the discussion on recent detections of vibra-
tionally excited HCN in extragalactic objects, collisional
excitation of HCN up to the vibrational levels has been
discarded (Sakamoto et al. 2010; Imanishi & Nakanishi
2013; Aalto et al. 2015b). Vibrational HCN levels are eﬃ-

S. Martín et al.: The unbearable opaqueness of Arp220

ciently excited by 14µm continuum photons provided that
TB > 100K (Aalto et al. 2015b). Our data show that the
peak of the continuum emission matches the position at
which vibrationally excited emission is found, which sup-
ports the idea that the emission is excited through con-
tinuum photons. Far-IR observations measure the photo-
spheric Tdust = 90 − 140 K from line excitations of various
species such as H2O or OH (González-Alfonso et al. 2012).
Since the inner Tdust will be higher, it would be compatible
with 14µm photon pumping.

If we assume local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE)
conditions, the excitation temperature of the HCN based
on the integrated intensities of the v2 = 1f J = 3 − 2 and
4 − 3 transitions is Tex ∼ 38 K and 45 K for the WN and
EN, respectively. Statistical errors in the ﬁt to the tran-
sitions are irrelevant since the main source of uncertainty
lies in the blending of the v2 = 1f transitions. If we do not
invoke radiative pumping in the WN for such an excita-
tion temperature, a column density of NHCN ∼ 1024 cm−2
would be required to account for the observed line inten-
sities, together with a 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48) source size. This column den-
sity would reach a few 1025 cm−2 for smaller source sizes
of ∼ 0.2(cid:48)(cid:48). Although numerically feasible if the medium is
dense enough (ncrit > 1011 cm−3 Ziurys & Turner 1986), it
would therefore impose unrealistic constraints on the HCN
abundances.
We further note that a hot interstellar medium (T (cid:29)
200 K) could explain the observed ﬂux densities for
NHCN (cid:28) 1018 cm−2 (for a 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48) source). However, under
these conditions, the optically thin ratio of the two v2 = 1f
transitions should be J = 4 − 3/3 − 2 ∼ 3, which does not
match the observed ratio of ∼ 2. These basic arguments,
which also apply to the EN, further conﬁrm the impossi-
bility of understanding HCN excitation without taking into
account radiative excitation through IR photons.
The derived excitation temperature of ∼ 40 K is consis-
tent with what is observed in NGC 4418 (Sakamoto et al.
2010), which, apart from Arp 220, is the only source for
which two HCN transitions in the v2 = 1 vibrational level
have been reported. We cannot reliably estimate the vi-
brational temperature as measured between the v = 0
and v2 = 1f transitions because of the heavy line absorp-
tion and blending features that aﬀect HCN. In addition,
HCN is probably optically thick. Observations of HC3N
in the vibrationally excited levels probe Tvib = 350 K be-
tween vibrational levels with Tex = 35 K measured within
the ground-vibrational state (Martín et al. 2011). This is
again quite similar to the excitation conditions measured
in NGC 4418 (Costagliola & Aalto 2010; Sakamoto et al.
2010), as has been noted by Costagliola et al. (2015). A
comprehensive explanation on the excitation of HCN vi-
brational levels was presented by Sakamoto et al. (2010)
for NGC 4418, which also applies to the conditions we ob-
serve in Arp 220.

By only visually inspecting the spectra in Fig. 3, we see
that the ratio between the peak ﬂux density of the HCN
v = 0 to the v2 = 1f line seems to be higher in the EN. This
would imply a lower Tvib , or possibly a weaker pumping ef-
fect on the excitation of HCN toward this nuclei. However,
the HCN line proﬁles again provide little information be-
cause of blending, absorptions, and optical thickness. From
the isotopic ratio observations of H13CN 3 − 2 by Tunnard
et al. (2015), we infer a ratio between the ﬂux densities of
the two nuclei of WN/EN= 2 − 3, depending on whether

we consider the integrated or peak ﬂux densities. Although
it is also aﬀected by absorption, this ratio is probably less
aﬀected by the opacity eﬀects. A proper temperature esti-
mate would require observations of the two lines at similar
resolution, given the diﬀerent extent of the H13CN v = 0
and the HCN v2 = 1 states. Qualitatively, the observed ra-
tio between the nuclei in the v2 = 1f transition is W/E∼ 2,
which implies that the Tvib in the EN is probably similar
to that in the WN. Further conclusions on the vibrational
temperature will be derived from the observations at simi-
lar resolution of the HCN isotopologs with ALMA (Martín
et al. in preparation) and from the spatially resolved HC3N
vibrational emission.

The excitation arguments above assume the vibra-
tionally excited levels to be optically thin. However, these
transitions could also be optically thick (González-Alfonso
in preparation). In the optically thick regime, the expected
ﬂux density line ratio is J = 4 − 3v2=1f /3 − 2v2=1f ∼ 1.75.
Based on the peak ﬂux densities, the observed ratios are 1.7
and 1.9 for the WN and EN, respectively (2.0 and 2.2 based
on the integrated ﬂux densities). Thus, the v2 = 1f emis-
sion might be optically thick. This would imply that the
emission originates from a very compact area. Taking as
limiting cases the excitation temperature measured above
Tex ∼ 40 K and that derived from HC3N vibrational lev-
els of Tvib ∼ 300 K, the observed HCN V2 = 1f peak ﬂux
densities in the WN would imply sizes of 0.18(cid:48)(cid:48) (66 pc) and
0.06(cid:48)(cid:48) (22 pc), respectively, while toward the EN, the ob-
served peak ﬂux densities would yield sizes of 0.11(cid:48)(cid:48) (40 pc)
and 0.04(cid:48)(cid:48) (15 pc). These sizes derived in the optically thick
regime are lower limits to the actual size of the emitting
regions toward the two nuclei.

5.2. Vibrational emission within the opaque dust

Vibrational emission of HCN is excited by 14µm dust pho-
tons. In Arp 220 dust starts to be optically thick (τ ∼ 1) at
∼ 1mm (Downes & Eckart 2007; Sakamoto et al. 2008) to-
ward the WN, with opacities increasing to τ ∼ 5.3 and 1.7
at 434µm for the WN and EN, respectively (Wilson et al.
2014). Dust is optically thick toward both nuclei at 14µm.
Additionally, a large gas surface density is determined to-
ward both nuclei (6 × 1024 and 2 × 1025cm−2, respectively,
Wilson et al. 2014). These conditions are ideal for the ex-
citation of vibrational transitions, according to Aalto et al.
(2015b), and they are met in both nuclei. In this case, the
dust obscured IR emission is re-emitted through the submm
and mm vibrational transitions of HCN, which gives us ac-
cess to the inner regions of the nuclei in which these tran-
sitions are excited.

However, in addition to the large amounts of material
driving the high opacity, excitation like this needs high dust
temperatures (Td > 100 K) for the emission at 14µm to
be bright enough. This requirement is met in the western
nucleus (Td ∼ 200 K), but not in the eastern nucleus (Td ∼
80 K, Wilson et al. 2014). We did not detect vibrational
emission toward the EN, which means that there must exist
a temperature gradient with temperatures > 100 K at the
center of its opaque dust nucleus. A temperature gradient
like this would be responsible for the self-absorption that
has been claimed to explain the line proﬁles and kinematics
of CO J = 6− 5 emission in the EN (Rangwala et al. 2015).
A similar gradient in the western nucleus would result in a

because of blending with HCO+ on the blueshifted side.

Fig. 3). Gaussian ﬁts were performed to these integrated
emission maps. Results are summarized in Table 4. Al-
though the continuum emission has a deconvolved size of
∼ 140 × 120 pc, the HCN vibrational emission is conﬁned
to a barely resolved region of ∼ 60 × 50 pc in the 4 − 3
transition. The ﬁt to the 3 − 2 vibrational transition
with a slightly larger beam is consistent with a point
source. Vibrational emission is centered on the peak of the
continuum. Similarly, the blue- and redshifted emissions
show the same extent within the uncertainties and are
also centered on the nuclear region. At our resolution of
∼ 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48) (∼ 185 pc) we cannot resolve any rotation around
the nucleus on the HCN v2 = 1f line. The large observed
line width in the vibrational HCN emission suggests that
it originates in the innermost regions of the EN. Based on
the position and compactness of the integrated emission
and on the velocity of the emission (Sect. 3.3), we can infer

S. Martín et al.: The unbearable opaqueness of Arp220

that we reached the regions at whose centers the mid-IR
opaque dust originates.

On the other hand, the HCN v2 = 1f line is more
severely aﬀected by blending in the WN. We therefore
only integrated the redshifted emission in the range of
20 − 170 km s−1. Again, the extent of the deconvolved
Gaussian ﬁtted emission is ∼ 60 × 50 pc, compared to the
∼ 120×60 pc ﬁtted to the continuum emission. In this case,
we observed a signiﬁcant oﬀset of 0.045(cid:48)(cid:48) of the spectral fea-
ture toward the northwest (P.A.∼ 120◦) with respect to the
continuum, in good agreement with the plane of rotation
measured with HCN (P.A. ∼ 45◦ Scoville et al. 2015), but
not with the gradient observed with CO in the inner region
(Sakamoto et al. 1999; Rangwala et al. 2015). Again, when
peering through the opaque mid-IR dust, the HCN v2 = 1f
line might be probing the kinematics of a hot dusty circum-
nuclear disk, as has been proposed by Aalto et al. (2015b),
with a radius of ∼ 18 pc.

5.3. High Lvib/LF IR ratio
In Table 3 we include the line luminosity (calculated follwo-
ing Eq.1 in Solomon & Vanden Bout 2005) of the two vibra-
tionally excited lines measured in the two nuclei. We also
present their ratios relative to the total luminosity of each
nucleus as estimated by Wilson et al. (2014). The diﬀerence
with the ratio reported by Aalto et al. (2015b) toward the
WN arises because they assumed log(LF IR) = 12 L(cid:12). We
show the dependence of this ratio on the quantum num-
ber J, where the line luminosity ratio is 4 − 3/3 − 2 ∼ 2.7.
This diﬀerence is similar to that of 2.5 derived in NGC 4418
(Aalto et al. 2015b).

The small sample of obscured galaxies compiled by
Aalto et al. (2015b) allowed them to tentatively suggest
that the ratio between the luminosity of the vibrationally
excited line and the galaxy bolometric luminosity (or LF IR
for these FIR-dominated objects) might be inversely cor-
related with fast outﬂows. A relatively high vibrationally
excited emission is therefore suggested as a probe of rapidly
evolving nuclear growth.

The two nuclei of Arp 220 show the highest Lvib/LF IR
ratio of all galaxies in which vibrationally excited emission
has been detected so far. Moreover, of the two nuclei, the
EN has a relatively brighter luminosity in the vibrational
transitions, where its ratio to the total luminosity is a factor
of 2-3 higher (depending on the way the vibrational emis-
sion is ﬁt, as discussed in Sect. 3.3) than what is measured
toward the WN. If we consider the more complex system of
absorbers in the WN as a sign of an evolved nucleus com-
pared to the single absorbing system in the EN, the lower
Lvib/LF IR toward the WN compared to the EN would ﬁt
into this suggested scenario and relate the high luminosity
ratio with the evolving nuclear growth. However, this pic-
ture is only tentative and needs to be tested in more detail.
Whether it is a quickly evolving supermassive black hole
or a very compact starburst giving rise to the bright emis-
sion in the vibrationally excited transitions (Andrews &
Thompson 2011; Aalto et al. 2015b), it aﬀects both nuclei.
Toward the EN, where no evidence has been found of an
embedded AGN, the vibrational emission would more likely
originate in a hot starburst. However, even a very compact
starburst all ﬁlled with hot cores similar to Sgr B2 within
the central few hundred parsecs (Cernicharo et al. 2006;
Martín et al. 2011) would not be able to explain such eﬃ-

cient emission or pumping of the vibrational levels (Aalto
et al. 2015b) because we measure a luminosity ratio a few
tens higher than what is measured in Galactic hot cores.

6. Summary and conclusions
We presented high-sensitivity and high-resolution (∼
180 pc) imaging of HCN and HCO+ in the 3 − 2 and 4 − 3
transitions together with the corresponding vibrationally
excited transitions of HCN and the underlying continuum
emission.

HCN and HCO+ are optically thick, and in addition,
these lines are aﬀected by various absorption systems and
signiﬁcant line blending. These eﬀects seem to be common
to other compact obscured nuclei (Aalto et al. 2015b). In
Arp 220 we observed that absorptions alone could hide up
to ∼ 70% of the total intrinsic HCN and HCO+ emission
lines, which may result in a poor tracing of the total content
of dense gas in the most deeply buried regions, where an
important fraction of the luminosity is generated. There-
fore it could result in an artiﬁcial enhancement of the SFE
in the most compact LIRGs and ULIRGs (Graciá-Carpio
et al. 2008). Moreover, these transitions may only be poorly
suited for studying the kinematics of the molecular gas in
the innermost regions around the Arp 220 nuclei, and they
might explain the discrepancy found in the moment maps
of HCN and CS (Scoville et al. 2015), where the absorption
will have a diﬀerent impact on each species. Thus, these
commonly used dense gas tracers severely limit studying
the innermost regions of compact obscured galaxy nuclei.
One of the key results from our observations is the clear
detection of vibrationally excited HCN in the 4 − 3 and
3 − 2 transitions not only toward the WN (previously re-
ported by Aalto et al. (2015b)), but also toward the EN.
The detection of this emission strongly supports the sce-
nario of a hot dust component (Td > 100 K) within each of
the two nuclei, which would require a temperature gradi-
ent toward the EN, where the measured dust temperature
is ∼ 80 K. Although the more compact WN shows an ob-
served dust temperature reaching ∼ 200 K, which is enough
for an eﬃcient radiative pumping, it will most likely show a
similar temperature gradient up to > 300 K as revealed by
the vibrational temperature measured with HC3N (Martín
et al. 2011).

Vibrationally excited HCN traces regions much closer
to the nucleus than those probed by the heavily absorbed
ground-vibrational HCN and HCO+ transitions. In both
nuclei we marginally resolved the vibrational emission ex-
tent to a region of 60 × 50 pc, which is smaller than the
measured continuum emitting regions of ∼ 140 × 120 pc
and ∼ 120 × 60 pc in the EN and WN, respectively.
The excitation temperature derived between the vibra-
tionally excited levels of ∼ 40 K probably reﬂects the level
population of the ground state of HCN (similar to that
measured for HC3N, Martín et al. 2011), which is then ef-
ﬁciently pumped radiatively to the v2 = 1 state through a
strong 14µm radiation ﬁeld. However, the peak ﬂux density
ratio between the two vibrational transitions might indicate
that the lines are optically thick. In this case, opacity would
again prevent us from studying these vibrational lines, and
we would be limited to the external layers of the hot dust re-
gion that excites these transitions. If these vibrational lines
are optically thick, it would imply that they are being emit-
ted from a much smaller region. From the optically thick

limit we can establish lower limits to the emitting region of
15 pc (EN) and 22 pc (WN). Even in this limit, the probed
scales with HCN v2 = 1f would be much smaller than those
for the ground-vibrational state transitions. The kinematics
of the vibrational emission can only be marginally hinted
at with our current resolution.
Based on the emission of HCO+ J = 3 − 2, we mea-
sured the receding velocity of the individual nuclei of
VW N,LSR,radio = 5342 ± 4 km s−1 and VEN,LSR,radio =
5454 ± 8km s−1. Vibrational emission is centered on these
nuclear velocities within the uncertainties, again support-
ing the fact that these transitions probe the innermost
regions around the nuclei. Thus, these emission lines are
unique probes of the nuclear enclosed masses. Estimated
vir ∼
virial masses are M W N
2−3×108 M(cid:12) within a radius of 25−30 pc of each nucleus.
This results in gas surface densities of 3±0.3×104 M(cid:12) pc−2
(WN) and 1.1 ± 0.1 × 104 M(cid:12) pc−2 (EN) for a conserva-
tive gas fraction fg = 0.1. Higher gas fractions would re-
sult in values close to the highest stellar surface density of
∼ 105 M(cid:12) pc−2 (Hopkins et al. 2010).
In both nuclei, we observed a high ratio between
the vibrational line luminosity and the galaxy luminosity
(Lvib/LF IR). Although the ratio observed toward the EN
is twice as high as that toward the WN, the ratio in both
nuclei is much higher than any other ratio measured toward
other luminous galaxies (Aalto et al. 2015b). A relative vi-
brational emission this high is diﬃcult to reconcile with a
compact starburst origin with Galactic type hot cores.
The absorbing gas was found to be blueshifted at a ve-
locity of −50 km s−1
relative to the EN velocity, while
the WN shows absorptions at 6 (which is consistent within
the errors with the WN velocity), −140, and −575 km s−1.
The absorbing gas systems toward the EN were found to be
blueshifted by ∼ −50 km s−1, and three systems in the WN
shifted by -6, -140, and -575 km s−1. These velocities refer
to the individual velocities of each nucleus. The blueshifted
absorption systems may be associated with the outﬂowing
clumps. The blueshifted absorptions toward the WN were
found to be marginally oﬀset from the center by ∼ 20 pc,
which is consistent with the bipolar outﬂow scenario sug-
gested for the SiO observations by Tunnard et al. (2015).
We found that most (∼ 90%) of the continuum emis-
sion at 1.2 and 0.85 mm is associated with the two nuclei,
which is consistent with the previous ﬁndings compiled in
Matsushita et al. (2009).

At the current resolution, we can infer some of the phys-
ical properties within the Arp 220 nuclei, but deeper in-
sight will be achieved through modeling of the vibrationally
excited emission in compact obscured nuclei (González-
Alfonso in preparation) and even higher spatial resolu-
tion observations of these infrared pumped transitions
(Sakamoto in preparation).
