We investigate the role of short-ranged electron-electron interactions in a paradigmatic model
of three dimensional topological insulators, using dynamical mean-ﬁeld theory and focusing on non
magnetically ordered solutions. The non-interacting band-structure is controlled by a mass term M ,
whose value discriminates between three diﬀerent insulating phases, a trivial band insulator and two
distinct topologically non-trivial phases. We characterize the evolution of the transitions between the
diﬀerent phases as a function of the local Coulomb repulsion U and ﬁnd a remarkable dependence of
the U -M phase diagram on the value of the local Hund’s exchange coupling J. However, regardless
the value of J, following the evolution of the topological transition line between a trivial band
insulator and a topological insulator, we ﬁnd a critical value of U separating a continuous transition
from a ﬁrst-order one. When the Hund’s coupling is signiﬁcant, a Mott insulator is stabilized at
large U . In proximity of the Mott transition we observe the emergence of an anomalous “Mott-like”
strong topological insulator state.

INTRODUCTION

Recently, the conventional Landau classiﬁcation of
matter has been complemented by the concept of topo-
logical phases. Rather than being distinguished by the
value of local order parameters reﬂecting spontaneously
broken symmetries, topological phases of matter are
characterized by global invariants describing topological
properties of the many-body wave-function. In the con-
text of band structure physics, the systematic search for
topological phases resulted in the discovery of a periodic
table1,2 that builds upon the Altland-Zirnbauer symme-
try classiﬁcation3.

seminal
theoretical4–6 and experimental7 discovery of
time
reversal symmetry (TRS) protected topological insula-
tors (TIs) has inspired the theoretical community to
analyze the inﬂuence of Coulomb repulsion on such
systems. Evidently, the interplay between signiﬁcant
Coulomb interactions and topological aspects of matter
holds the promise of nontrivial and intriguing eﬀects
emerging from the competition between the localization
tendency induced by strong correlations and the peculiar
band-structure of TIs.
Regarding the inﬂuence of
electron-electron interactions on 2D TIs, a wealth of
results has been accumulated focusing on several model
Hamiltonians with diﬀerent techniques (for a recent
review see e.g. Ref. 8). Among others, the eﬀect of
strong correlations on quantum spin Hall insulators and
the related topological transitions have been addressed

using quantum Monte-Carlo calculations9–11, various
cluster based approaches12–16, as well as dynamical mean
ﬁeld theory (DMFT) and extensions17–24. Interestingly,
the possibility of inducing the formation of a topological
phase by means of electronic repulsion has also been
proposed25,26.

In three spatial dimensions (3D), symmetry-protected
TIs have been have been suggested theoretically27–30
only about two years later than their counterparts in
2D. Remarkably, 3D TIs that preserve TRS exhibit non-
degenerate Dirac fermion surface states. This feature
makes them particularly appealing for fundamental sci-
ence questions related to relativistic quantum mechanics.
Soon after their theoretical prediction, these topological
phases of matter have been experimentally detected in
three-dimensional calchogenides31–35.

The interplay of strong electronic correlations with the
various topological phases, realizable in 3D27, pledges
to unlock access to a large variety of possible anoma-
lous states. For instance, some iridate compounds, with
a pronounced three-dimensional character and the con-
comitant presence of strong spin-orbit coupling and size-
able electron-electron interaction, have been proposed
either as correlated 3D TIs36 or to host even more ex-
otic, fractionalized topological states37,38. The role of in-
teractions in enhancing the eﬀect of spin-orbit coupling
has been proposed as key to understand the onset of a
topological Kondo insulating state in both SmB6 and
39–43. Additionally, the realization of an interaction
PuB6
driven topological Mott insulating state has been eluci-
dated for diﬀerent 3D systems36,44. More recently a Plat-

inum oxide, Ca2PtO4, has also been suggested to become
a d-electron weak TI if doped with holes 45. Moreover,
the realization of 3D TIs in oxides46, which have typi-
cally sizeable values of the interaction parameters, gives
a further motivation to study the interplay of topology
and electronic interactions. However, the more compli-
cated topological structure of the 3D TIs with respect
the their 2D counterparts has not yet allowed for a sys-
tematic study of correlated eﬀects in 3D.

In this work, we present a thorough study of the ef-
fects of a local electronic interaction onto the proper-
ties of a paradigmatic model of a 3D TI. Using DMFT,
we solve non-perturbatively a two-band Hubbard model
in presence of a multi-orbital density-density interaction,
featuring a Hund’s coupling term. We characterize the
evolution of the non-trivial topological states of the sys-
tem as a function of the interaction strength. We obtain
the phase-diagrams of the model in the two-dimensional
space spanned by the Hubbard repulsion and the crystal-
ﬁeld splitting, and determine the transition lines between
insulating phases with diﬀerent topological properties.
One of the most prominent features of the model is that
the transition line between the trivial band insulator and
the strong topological insulator is divided in two parts
by a critical point.

For weak interactions the phase-transition is adiabat-
ically connected with the non-interacting transition and
it is continuous. On the contrary, in the large interaction
regime beyond the critical point, the topological quan-
tum phase transition (TQPT) becomes of the ﬁrst-order.
Unlike the conventional scenario, the TQPT takes place
without continuous closing of the spectral gap, which
abruptly “inverts” across the transition.
Interestingly,
this result extends to the 3D case a recent ﬁnding of ours
valid for quantum spin Hall insulators in 2D24. Reducing
the crystal-ﬁeld splitting, the strong topological insula-
tor, in the present case, turns into a weak topological
insulator through a transition which remains continuous,
irrespective of the strength of the interaction. This eﬀect
has no analog in the previously studied 2D model.

This sequence of transitions occurs for every value of
the Hund’s exchange coupling J, even if the shape of the
phase diagram in the U -M plane is strongly inﬂuenced
by the presence of the exchange coupling. A qualita-
tive eﬀect of J is that it allows for a topologically trivial
Mott insulating state for large values of the interaction
strength. This leads to one further TQPT which sep-
arates the weak 3D TI from the trivial Mott Insulator
(MI). We ﬁnally point out that, in a tiny slice border-
ing the transition line between the 3D TI and MI, we
observe the appearance of an anomalous strong “Mott-
like topological insulator”. Such anomalous strong TI
is continuously connected to the MI but separated by a
ﬁrst-order discontinuity from the weak 3D TI state.

The article is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we intro-
duce the non-interacting model for the 3D TI and dis-
cuss its solution within the framework of DMFT. We
also brieﬂy describe the calculation of the Z2 topologi-

2

cal invariant with and without interactions. The multi-
ple phases of the non-interacting model are reviewed in
Sec. III. The eﬀects of the electronic correlations onto
the model solution are discussed in Sec. IV, where we
also present the phase diagrams of the full model.
In
Sec. V, we illustrate the ways the diﬀerent topological
phase transitions occur. Finally, the transition to the
Mott insulator is described in Sec. VI which precedes the
conclusions of the paper.

II. MODEL

We consider a two-orbital Fermi-Hubbard model de-
ﬁned on a three-dimensional cubic lattice. The model
Hamiltonian reads:

the operators cklσ (c
klσ), which annihilate (create) an
electron at the orbital l = 1, 2 with momentum k and
spin σ. In order to write the explicit expression for ˆH(k)
let us introduce the 4×4 Γ-matrices, deﬁned as follows:

Γ2 = −1 ⊗ τy =

Γ3 = σx ⊗ τx =

Γ4 = σy ⊗ τx =

Γ5 = 1 ⊗ τz =

(2)

where τx,y,z and σx,y,z are the Pauli matrices respectively
in orbital and in spin space and 1 is the unit matrix. In
terms of these Γi matrices we have:

ˆH(k) = M (k)Γ5+λ sin(kx)Γ1+

λ sin(ky)Γ2 + λ sin(kz)Γ3

(3)

with M (k) = M−[cos(kx)+cos(ky)+cos(kz)]. This term
of the model Hamiltonian would describe a system of two
bands of width W = 6, hybridizing with an amplitude
λ and separated by a crystal-ﬁeld splitting 2M . In the
following we shall set  as our energy unit. In addition we
ﬁx λ = 0.3 for deﬁniteness having checked that qualita-
tively similar results can be obtained for diﬀerent values
of λ. Throughout this paper we consider a total density
of two electrons per site, which corresponds to a global
half-ﬁlling of our band-structure and leads to a particle-
hole symmetry.

for z ∈ C. Equation (5) relates the Weiss Field ˆG−1
0 (z),
describing the properties of the eﬀective bath, to the lo-
cal physics of the lattice problem expressed by the local
Green’s function ˆGloc(z). All the eﬀects of the interac-
tions are included in the self-energy ˆΣ(z) which is a 4×4
matrix. Owing to the symmetries of our model, including
the particle-hole symmetry at half-ﬁlling, the self-energy
becomes diagonal in the spin-orbital basis, and it turns
out to acquire the following structure in terms of the Γ-
matrices:

ˆΣ(z) =

(cid:88)

with gk, uk ∈ R. In particular, the real- and imaginary-
part of the Matsubara self-energy ˆΣ(iωn) satisﬁes the
relation:

ˆΣ(iωn) = ReΣ(iωn)Γ5 + iImΣ(iωn)Γ0

(7)

which means that the full self-energy is parametrised by
a single scalar complex function Σ(iωn). Eq. (7) implies
that the imaginary part of the self-energy is the same for
all the spin and orbital components, while the real part
is the same for the two spin components and it has the
opposite sign for the two orbitals. As a matter of fact the
real part of the scalar self-energy is simply added to the
bare splitting M . Therefore we can deﬁne an eﬀective
mass term in terms of the low-frequency limit of the self-
energy22,48,49

Meﬀ = M + ReΣ(ω = 0)

(8)

In the following we will show that this quantity controls
the location of the topological phase transitions in the
presence of interactions.

We solve the eﬀective problem by using an exact diag-
onalization impurity solver50–52. Throughout the whole
paper we focus on non magnetically-ordered solutions,
therefore the TRS is preserved.
In this scheme the ef-
fective bath is discretized to a ﬁnite number Nb of levels
coupled to the No = 2 impurity orbitals. The resulting
Hamiltonian is solved by means of the Lanczos technique
which allows to determine the lowest part of the spec-
trum as well as the dynamical correlation functions at
zero and low temperatures. In this work we performed
calculations for Nb = 8 and checked the convergence as
a function of Nb by comparing with Nb = 10 for selected
values of the model parameters.
Topological invariants – Three dimensional topolog-
ical insulators preserving TRS with T 2 = −1, are classi-
ﬁed by four Z2 topological invariants27, here denoted by
(cid:126)ν = (ν0; ν1 ν2 ν3). The latter three numbers νi, i = 1 . . . 3

tice. The arrows indicate the three dimensional path in the
reciprocal space used to depict the bands in the next Fig.2

The second term of the model Hamiltonian (1) de-
scribes the screened Coulomb repulsion. We assume a lo-
cal interaction with a full orbital structure, namely inter-
and intra-orbital repulsion and the Hund’s coupling J,
which describes the exchange eﬀect, which favours high-
spin conﬁgurations, which correspond to the two elec-
trons occupying diﬀerent orbitals. More explicitly the
interaction is:

where U is the strength of the electron-electron interac-
†
tion and nilσ = c
ilσcilσ is the local density for the or-
k e−ik·icklσ. We
notice that this Hamiltonian only contains the “density-
density” part of the Hund’s exchange and neglects the
so-called pair-hopping and spin-ﬂip terms47.

DMFT solution – We investigate the solution of the
model (1) using Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT).
Within DMFT the quantum many-body lattice Hamilto-
nian (1) is mapped onto an eﬀective quantum impurity
problem. The impurity site features all the local interac-
tions of the original problem. In our case, it corresponds
to a two-orbital impurity with interactions of the same
form of Eq. (4) coupled to an eﬀective bath. The bath
is a frequency dependent quantity whose functional form
is obtained self-consistently by imposing that the impu-
rity problem reproduces the local physics of the lattice
problem. The DMFT mapping therefore approximates
the self-energy of the lattice problem with a momentum-
independent one obtained from the solution of the eﬀec-
tive quantum impurity problem. In terms of this function

kxkykzω = 0. The only ﬁnite contribution thus comes from the
real-part Re ˆΣ(ω → 0).

If inversion symmetry is not broken, as for our model
(1), the deﬁnition of the topological invariants is drasti-
cally simpliﬁed 61,62. Following Ref. 62, we obtain the
eigenstates of ˆHt at the eight time reversal invariant mo-
menta (TRIM) Ki=1...8 and for the occupied bands α.
These states can be chosen as eigenstates of the parity
operator P with eigenvalue piα = ±1. The diﬀerent Z2
invariants νc=0,...,3 are then calculated using the relation:

(cid:89)

i∈Acα

νc =

piα.

√−1 = +i is used, c =
where the phase convention
0, . . . , 3 labels the components of the global invariant vec-
tor (cid:126)ν, and Ac indicates the set of TRIM points as follows
(see Fig. 1 for the labels of the TRIM):

A0 = [Γ, X(cid:48), M, X, A, Z, A(cid:48), R]
A1 = [X(cid:48), M, R, A(cid:48)]
A2 = [X, A, R, M ]
A3 = [Z, A(cid:48), R, A] ,

(10)

where the location in momentum space of the TRIM
points is depicted in Fig.1. Quite intuitively, the sets
Ac, c = 0 . . . 3 entering the weak topological invariants
are conﬁned to 2D planes with three orthogonal orienta-
tions in the 3D Brillouin zone while the strong topological
invariant involves all eight TRIM.

III. TOPOLOGICAL TRANSITIONS IN THE

NON-INTERACTING LIMIT

We begin our analysis from the non-interacting model
U = J = 0. The Hamiltonian (3) describes a three-
dimensional system undergoing a series of topological
quantum phase transitions as a function of the crystal-
ﬁeld splitting term M . The band structure along the
path in the reciprocal space depicted in Fig.1 for the
various phases is reported in Fig.2. For |M| < 1 the
model describes a weak topological insulator (WTI) with
a global invariant (cid:126)ν = (0; 111). The smallest direct gap is
placed near the point Z (A) for M > 0 (M < 0) in cor-
respondence to a slight inversion of the band character.
A more robust band inversion takes place close to the Γ
point. A Dirac-like gap closure takes place at the points
Z (A) for M = 1 (M = −1).
For values of M in the range 1 < |M| < 3 there is a
transition to a strong topological insulating (STI) state.
In the M > 0 region such state is characterized by a
global invariant (cid:126)ν = (1; 000), while for M < 0 the STI has
(cid:126)ν = (1; 111). The values of the topological invariants
reﬂect diﬀerences in the band structures: For M > 3
the smallest direct gap and band inversion takes place
around the Γ point, while for M <−3 these are located
in proximity of the R point.

band-structure (left) as a function of M and consequent

vals on the right indicates the diﬀerent topological phases of
the system. The colors of the band structures correspond to
the orbital character. The plot also illustrates the diﬀerence
between the strong topological insulator realized at M > 0,
i.e. STIΓ, and the one realized at M < 0, i.e. STIR.

are so called weak topological invariants that describe
stacks of 2D topological insulators in the same symmetry
class. Such weak topological insulators are only deﬁned
in lattice systems. By contrast, the strong topological
invariant ν0 also exists in continuum systems and ex-
hibits a much stronger robustness against disorder.
In
the presence of interactions, all these invariants can be
generalized to topological properties of the single particle
Green’s function 53–59.

As it has been shown in Ref. 60, the practical compu-
tation of such interacting invariants formally reduces to
that of a non-interacting problem, where the role of the
Bloch Hamiltonian is played by the so-called topological
Hamiltonian which reads as

ˆHt(k) = − ˆG−1(k, ω = 0) = ˆH(k) + ˆΣ(ω = 0).

For the insulating phases considered in this work, the
imaginary part of the self-energy is linearly vanishing in

continued beyond this value by the dashed (orange) line. The union of these two lines indicates the boundary between the
Trivial Insulator and the Strong Topological Insulator (1, 000). The dotted (blue) line indicates the transition from the STI to
the weak topological insulator (0, 111). In the right panel the solid (yellow) line is the boundary of the Mott Insulating region.
The ﬁlled (grey) area near the Mott phase shows the re-entrant anomalous STI (1, 111) phase, precursor of the Mott transition.

For |M| = 3 the system undergoes a TQPT from the
STI to the trivial band insulator (BI) at |M| > 3, see
Fig.2. At the transition the topological invariant under-
goes a sudden change to the trivial value (cid:126)ν = (0; 000).
The TQPT is continuous with the formation of a Dirac-
like gap closure at the point Γ (M = 3) or R (M =−3).
For this reason we will indicate with ST IΓ and ST IR re-
spectively the strong topological phases for M > 0 and
M < 0.

IV.

INTERACTING PHASE DIAGRAMS

We now turn our attention to the eﬀects of the inter-
action onto the properties of the TQPT in the model
(1). For deﬁniteness we restrict our analysis to the posi-
tive values of the splitting M . Analogous results can be
obtained for the M < 0 case.

Our results are summarized in the phase-diagrams in
the U -M plane reported in Fig.3. The ﬁgure compares
the phase-diagram in the U -M plane for zero Hund’s cou-
pling J = 0 (left panel) to that for J = U/4 (right panel).
In both diagrams one clearly sees that the two transitions
of the non-interacting system occurring from M = 3 (be-
tween BI and STI) and M = 1 (between STI and WTI)
are continued into boundary lines that extend in the dia-
gram as U is increased. The phase boundaries have been
drawn according to explicit evaluation of the topological
invariants from the single-particle Green’s function53–57.
However, at least two macroscopic diﬀerences appear
immediately: (i) a Mott insulating phase is obtained only
for ﬁnite J and (ii) the phase boundaries separating re-
spectively BI from STI and STI from WTI have a com-
pletely diﬀerent behavior as a function of U , where the
critical M decreases as a function of U in the absence of

J, and it has the opposite behavior for ﬁnite J. We notice
that for a wide range of J the phase diagram is similar
to that of J = U/4, with the only exception of very small
values of J/U , where the boundary lines ﬁrst decrease
(as for J = 0) and then increase (as for J = U/4) as a
function of U 63.

We can understand these diﬀerences analyzing the real-
part of the self-energy Re ˆΣ, which renormalizes the bare
splitting between the orbitals.
In Fig.4 we report the
evolution of Re ˆΣ as U is increased for J = 0 (left panel)
and J > 0 (right panel).

The diﬀerence is apparent: for J = 0 the self-energy is
positive and increases with U , while for J > 0 it is a neg-
ative quantity whose absolute values grows with U . This
implies that in the absence of J the interaction eﬀectively
enhances the crystal-ﬁeld splitting, while an opposite ef-
fect takes place for ﬁnite J. This is easily understood
since the Hund’s coupling favours conﬁgurations in which
the electrons populate the diﬀerent orbitals to maximize
the spin (One can visualize this very simply in the atomic
limit where all the kinetic terms are neglected), while in
the absence of J intra- and inter-orbital repulsion are
identical and the electrons can freely populate the or-
bitals.

As a result, for J = 0 the interactions lead to a very
large eﬀective splitting, which favours a BI conﬁguration
in which only one orbital is populated. For this reason
the boundary lines decrease as a function of U . On the
contrary, for ﬁnite J and large interaction a weak eﬀec-
tive splitting leads to a Mott insulator with one electron
per orbital and increases the threshold to reach the topo-
logical transitions.

In addition to the J-dependence, the evolution of the
self-energy of Fig.4 reveals another important feature.

V. TOPOLOGICAL QUANTUM

PHASE-TRANSITIONS.

We now study in details the eﬀect of correlations on
the two transitions connecting respectively the BI from
the STIΓ and the latter from the WTI.

As we mentioned in Sec.

II, the transition lines can
be traced according to the evolution of the eﬀective mass
term Meﬀ , which is the only way in which the interactions
inﬂuence the value of the topological invariants.

The TQPT from the trivial BI to STIΓ is deﬁned by
the condition Meﬀ = 3 which generalizes the condition
M = 3 valid for the non-interacting case, and naturally
reduces to it for U = 0 when the self-energy vanishes.
The whole Meﬀ = 3 line is characterized by a change
of the bulk topological invariant (cid:126)ν from (0, 000) in the
trivial BI phase to (1, 000) in the STIΓ. However the
nature of such transition changes dramatically from the
weak to the strong interaction regime, as evidenced by
the behavior of Meﬀ reported in Fig.6 for J = 0 and
J > 0. In both cases, for low values of the interaction U
the transition remains continuous, similarly to the non-
interacting regime discussed in Sec. III. This reﬂects the
fact that, if the correlation strength is small, the TQPT
can be very well described within a Hartree-Fock picture,
as already indicated by the behavior of Ξ. In this eﬀec-
tive single-particle picture a change in the mass term M
perfectly compensates the eﬀects of the interaction U ,
ultimately leading to a continuous, non-interacting like,
TQPT. This behavior is illustrated in Fig.6 for the small-
est values of U for which the crossing of the Meﬀ = 3 line
is continuous.

By increasing the interaction strength U above the crit-
ical value U > Uc, the degree of correlation of the STIΓ
becomes no longer negligible. Consequently, a renor-
malized single-particle description of the TQPT breaks

self-energy ReΣ(iωn) for an increasing interaction strength

M = 4.5 with J = U/4 (right panel). The ﬁgure illustrates
the opposite algebraic sign of the self-energy in the two in-
vestigated cases. It also points out the pronounced frequency
dependence at low-energy.

self-energy is essentially constant as a function of the
imaginary frequency. This is consistent with a Hartree-
Fock solution (or static mean-ﬁeld) which can indeed ob-
tained at lowest order in a diagrammatic expansion. As
U increases Re ˆΣ acquires a more and more pronounced
frequency dependence. Roughly speaking the dynami-
cal nature of the interaction eﬀects is measured by the
diﬀerence between the low-frequency limit, in which the
dynamical correlation eﬀects are dominant and the large-
frequency limit, that we label as a static mean-ﬁeld value

In Fig.5 we report the behavior of Ξ as a function of
M for diﬀerent values of U and J = U/4. For a ﬁxed
value of the interaction U the system is driven through a
TQPT by decreasing M below a given critical value. In
the weakly interacting regime the degree of correlation Ξ
remains small and smooth across the TQPT (for smaller
values of U than those considered in the ﬁgure, Ξ is even
more structureless at the topological transition). This
behavior changes dramatically in the strongly interacting
regime: The curves of Ξ at constant U become divided
into to distinct parts: the large-M piece resembles the
weak dependence of the small-U region. For M below
the TQPT (marked in the ﬁgure by a dotted line) Ξ gets
instead very rapidly large indicating a strong degree of
many-body character of the solutions. This characteris-
tic behaviour of Ξ reﬂects a simple physical eﬀect: The
fully polarized BI with two electrons in the lowest orbital
bands is essentially unaﬀected by the strength of the in-
teraction. On the other hand the topological STIΓ and
WTI region do not have a full orbital polarization (hence
a higher degree of hybridization). As such they react
more vigorously to the presence of interaction, evolving
from a weakly perturbed regime to a strongly correlated
topological state, as evidenced by Ξ.

dimensions 24 for quantum spin Hall insulators. In the
three-dimensional system, the transition from the BI to
the STIΓ is therefore continuous for small values of U but
it becomes of ﬁrst-order upon crossing the critical point,
at which the orbital ﬂuctuations become critical24. The
breakdown of the continuous character of the TQPT in
Hamiltonian models similar to our has been recently in-
vestigated by means of a renormalization group analysis
in Ref. 64.

Our ﬁndings resembles the marginal quantum criti-
cality scenario proposed in Refs. 65–67, where a criti-
cal point separates a ﬁrst-order line from a second-order
one. However, a thorough analysis of the scaling prop-
erties near the critical point are required to establish a
more detailed connection, which is however beyond the
scope of this work.

Interestingly, while the increased level of correlation
strength dramatically aﬀects the TQPT, it has a very
weak impact on the other topological transition, the one
from STIΓ to the WTI. Here the change of the bulk in-
variant from (cid:126)ν = (1, 000) to (cid:126)ν = (0, 111) is always ac-
companied by a continuous evolution at Meﬀ = 1. To
the best of our accuracy we did not ﬁnd any evidence
of discontinuity, even at the largest investigated value of
the interaction strength U . This behavior can be under-
stood noting that, although topologically distinct, the
two non-trivial states react in a very similar way to the
large interaction having a comparable degree of orbital
hybridization. Thus, unlike the BI to STIΓ TQPT, in
this case it is always possible to continuously transform
the STIΓ ground state into that of the WTI.

A. Absence of gap closing transition.

As we discussed in the initial sections II and III, in
the non-interacting limit the TQPT are always continu-
ous. This ultimately depends on the fact that the band
structure of the system evolves smoothly with respect to
changes in the model parameters, e.g. M , as long as the
energy gap is preserved. In presence of large interaction
however this scenario is challenged and a diﬀerent behav-
ior can be envisaged. We shall now show how the change
in the TQPT character across the phase-diagram aﬀects
the spectral properties of the transitions.

(cid:104)

Our results about the absence of a gap closing TQPT
are summarized in Fig.7. Each plot reports the behav-
ior of the poles P (k) of the Green’s function ˆG(k, ω) =

= 0, near the point Γ = (0, 0, 0) and
along the path [−R, Γ, R]. The curve P (k) sets the posi-
tion of the electronic excitations, it determines the spec-
trum of the system and helps determining the properties
of the bulk spectral gap. From left to right, the ﬁgure
shows the evolution of the poles as a function of M across
the BI-STIΓ transition for three values of the interaction
strength U : Below, at and above the critical point.

down.
In particular, the strong dynamical dependence
of the self-energy in this regime does not allow to com-
pensate the eﬀects of the interactions by means of a
static change of M . The transition is still positioned
at Meﬀ = 3 but the ground states in the trivial BI and in
the more correlated STIΓ can indeed no longer be contin-
uously connected across the TQPT. As a consequence, a
ﬁrst-order jump is required to move from one phase to
the other. The existence of such a ﬁrst-order TQPT is
demonstrated in Fig.6, where we show the evolution of
Meﬀ for values of U above the critical point. As the ﬁg-
ure shows, in such regime the eﬀective mass term displays
a discontinuity at Meﬀ = 3, irrespective of the value of
the Hund’s coupling J. As a further hallmark of the
ﬁrst-order character of the correlated TQPT, we show
the hysteretic cycle across the transition in the inset to
Fig.6.

This ﬁnding shows that electron-electron correlation
profoundly change the nature of the topological phase
transitions, similarly to what we already found in two

Figure 7.
(Color Online) Absence of bulk gap closing: Evolution of the Green’s functions poles, i.e. the band dispersions. We
ﬁnd a continuous transition at weak interaction (U = 2), contrasted by the absence of bulk gap closure at strong interaction
(U = 11).

For small values of U the transition occurs through
the formation of a Dirac cone at the Γ point, as ex-
pected by the continuity of the TQPT with respect to
the non-interacting case. On the contrary, for U > Uc
the topological transition takes place without a closure
of the spectrum, as we show in the panels (b)-(c). Thus,
at the strongly correlated transition point the gap jumps
discontinuously from the trivial to the topological value,
although in proximity of the critical point it becomes
very small. The absence of any gap-less state separating
the two phases across the TQPT is a remarkable eﬀect
induced by the strong electronic correlation.

VI. MOTT TRANSITION.

One of the qualitative changes brought in by a ﬁnite
value of the Hund’s coupling is the onset of a Mott insu-
lating region for large U , as we reported in Fig.3 (right
panel). Indeed, in this case the system favours the forma-
tion of an orbital un-polarized state, ultimately leading to
an instability towards the high-spin Mott phase as soon
as the equal occupation of each orbital is reached24,63.
Such a high-spin Mott insulator cannot be realized in
the J = 0 case, where the strong interaction favours the
formation of an orbitally polarized conﬁguration, i.e. a
trivial band insulator (see Fig.3).

In Fig.8(a) we demonstrate the existence of a Mott
transition for large values of U . The formation of a Mott
insulating state is signaled by the divergence of the imag-
inary part of the self-energy at the chemical potential.
Thus we can identify the onset of the Mott phase by
means of the reduction to zero of the renormalization
−1. The
constant Z, deﬁned as Z = [1 − ∂Σ(ω)/∂ω|ω→µ]
diﬀerent phases of the system have an insulating char-
acter, thus we can not interpret Z in terms of a quasi-
particle weight. As our results show, for a ﬁxed value
of the interaction U , we can drive the Z towards zero
by decreasing the mass term M , entering this way the
high-spin Mott phase (see Fig.3). The Mott transition
has a characteristic ﬁrst-order behavior, with all the ob-

servables showing a discontinuity at the transition point
and a small hysteretic behavior (not shown). The pres-
ence of such a discontinuity is evident in the behavior of
Z for a small enough value of U , but it becomes smaller
approaching the large U regime. The Mott transition
line ends in a triple point, beyond which any correlated
topological state disappears, opening the way to a direct
transition from the polarized trivial BI to the high-spin
Mott state24,63.

A. Small region of anomalous STIR phase.

In correspondence of the divergence of the imaginary
part of the self-energy at the Mott point, the real part
Re ˆΣ(iωn) becomes large and strongly frequency depen-
dent (see Fig.8(c)). This behavior is necessary for the
opening and the stabilization of the Mott gap. The pro-
gressive localization of the electrons obliterates the topo-
logical properties of the system, which are related to the
low-energy band structure. In other words the large neg-
ative (for J > 0) values of Re ˆΣ(0) dominate the spec-
trum of the topological Hamiltonian Eq. (9), giving rise
to a trivial topological invariant (cid:126)ν = (0; 000) for the Mott
phase.

Interestingly, we ﬁnd that for intermediate values of
both the interaction U and mass M the system admits
an anomalous topological phase in proximity of the Mott
transition point.
In particular, our results show that
the formation of the Mott insulator can be preceded by
a TQPT to a STI state with (cid:126)ν = (1, 111), i.e. STIR,
which coating the boundary line separates the WTI from
the Mott insulating region. The existence of such tiny
region near the Mott phase is reported in the phase-
diagram in Fig.3 (right panel). The origin of such anoma-
lous STIR state in the M > 0 can be understood from
the behavior of the self-energy in proximity of the Mott
point. Near the Mott region Re ˆΣ(iωn) can attain val-
ues which are large enough to compensate the initial M ,
but such that the eﬀective mass is pushed into the range
Meﬀ ∈ [−1,−3]. For any such value of Meﬀ the spec-

ization. We solved the interacting problem in a non-
perturbative way using dynamical mean-ﬁeld theory. We
determined the zero temperature phase-diagrams of the
model as a function of the interaction strength U and the
crystal-ﬁeld, or mass term, M , both for zero and ﬁnite
values of the local Hund’s’ coupling J. We explained the
speciﬁc form of the diagrams in both cases in terms of the
diﬀerent behaviours of the self-energy functions, account-
ing for the interaction eﬀects at the single-particle level.
The existence of a topologically trivial Mott insulating
state for J > 0 and large U is shown.

We point out that, notably, the phase diagrams fea-
ture the presence of a critical point on the topological
quantum phase-transition line separating the trivial band
insulators from the strong topological phase.
In addi-
tion we unveiled the evolution of the topological tran-
sition crossing such critical point. Our ﬁndings demon-
strate that in the weak-interaction regime the transition
remains continuous while in the strong-coupling regime,
i.e. beyond the critical point, the transition becomes dis-
continuous, i.e. a ﬁrst-order transition.

The main consequence of the ﬁrst-order character ap-
pearing beyond a critical point in the orbital sector is the
absence of gap closing. This means that the inversion in
the orbital character responsible for the change in the
topological invariants is not accompanied by a continu-
ous evolution of the spectral gap, if many-body processes
dominate. This is a novel observation that clearly charac-
terize the transition from the trivial band-insulator to the
strong-TI phase. The successive strong-to-weak topologi-
cal transition is instead always of second-order character,
as in the non-interacting band-structure. These results
generalize and extend to the three-dimensional case our
ﬁndings for the topological transition to the quantum
spin Hall state in two-dimensions24.

In addition, we ﬁnd the existence of a (1; 111) phase,
i.e. a strong TI phase which appears before the eventual
transition from the weak- to the trivial Mott insulator.
An analysis of the orbital occupations in this narrow re-
gion of the phase diagram reveals that this phase is con-
tinuously connected to the Mott insulating one and may
therefore be seen as a novel kind of “topological Mott in-
sulator”. Unlike the original proposal by Raghu et al.25
this phase is characterized by no long-range order and it
is the result of a strong competition of the dynamical self-
energies, i.e. it has an intimate many-body nature which
cannot be captured by any single-particle approximation.

point. (b) Orbital occupation across the WTI-Mott Insulator

trum of the topological Hamiltonian would correspond
to a global topological invariant of (cid:126)ν = (1; 111), i.e. give
rise to a STIR phase.

Unexpectedly, the anomalous STIR phase is separated
from the WTI by a ﬁrst-order like transition, while it
is continuously connected with the Mott insulating re-
gion. This behavior is well visible in the Fig.8(b), where
we report the orbital occupations as a function of M in
the region near the anomalous STIR phase. As the plot
shows, for small M the occupations are both equal and
identical to one, as expected in the Mott phase. By in-
creasing M above the Mott transition value M > MMT
the occupations continuously deviates from one, signaling
the onset of the anomalous STIR phase. This behavior is
suddenly arrested by increasing M above a second crit-
ical value M > MR, at which a ﬁrst-order discontinuity
in the occupations denotes the TQPT to the WTI phase.
