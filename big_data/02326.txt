Surprising coincidence of the apparent 2D metal-to-insulator transition data with

Fermi-gas based model results

A.F.Ioﬀe Physical-Technical Institute, 194021 St.Petersburg, Russia

M. V. Cheremisin

The melting condition for two-dimensional Wigner solid ( P.M. Platzman, H.Fukuyama, 1974)
is shown to contain an error of a factor of π. The analysis of experimental data for apparent 2D
metal-to-insulator transition shows that the Wigner solidiﬁcation (B.Tanatar, D.M.Ceperley, 1989)
has been never achieved. Within routine Fermi gas model both the metallic and insulating behavior
of diﬀerent 2D system for actual range of carrier densities and temperatures is explained.

PACS numbers: 71.27.+a, 71.30.+h, 72.10.-d

Recently, much interest has been focused on the
anomalous transport behavior of a wide variety of low
density two-dimensional (2D) systems. It has been found
that below some critical density, cooling causes an in-
crease in resistivity, whereas in the opposite, high-density
case, the resistivity decreases. The apparent metal to in-
sulator transition was observed in n-Si MOSFET [1, 2],
p-GaAs[3–6], n-GaAs[7], n-SiGe[8, 9] and p-SiGe [10, 11]
2D systems.

Let us provide the rigorous analysis of the experimen-
tal data regarding Fermi gas vs Wigner solid transition.
According to Ref.[12], the melting diagram of 2D Wigner
solid obeys the condition Γ = Eee/hKi, where Γ is the
coeﬃcient assumed to be a constant at the phase tran-
√πN is the Coulomb energy associated
sition, Eee = e2

to neighboring pair of electrons, N is the 2D density.
Within conventional Fermi gas model, hKi = kT F1(1/ξ)
F0(1/ξ)
is the average kinetic energy of single electron, where
Fn(z) is the Fermi integral of the order of n, ξ = kT /µ
the dimensionless temperature. Note that the average
kinetic energy hKi coincides with the thermal energy kT
In contrast,
for classical Boltzmann carriers |ξ| ≫ 1.
hKi = µ/2 for degenerate electrons ξ ≪ 1. In general,
the solidiﬁcation of strongly degenerated electrons is be-
lieved to occur at certain value of the Coulomb to Fermi
energy ratio rs = Eee/µ. We therefore conclude that
rs = Γ/2. In Refs.[12, 14], this ratio has been erroneously
√π
deﬁned as rs = Γ
2 , thus provides wrong estimate for
Wigner crystal solidiﬁcation. For low-disorder 2D system
Wigner solid was claimed[13] to exist when rs = 37± 5.
Following Ref.[12], the phase transition can be param-
eterized as it follows:

values Tc, Nc ∼ Γ−2 are lower by a factor of π with
respect to those predicted in Refs.[12, 14]. For actual
2D systems the values Tc, Nc are generalized in Table
I. In Fig.1 we plot the melting curve[12] speciﬁed by
Eq.(1) and, moreover, the observed range of 2D densities
and temperatures attributed to apparent metal-insulator
transition[1–9]. Evidently, Wigner solidiﬁcation regime
remains unaﬀected. Hence, we suggest the typical 2D
systems can be described within routine Fermi gas model.

II. MODEL OF APPARENT METAL-TO

INSULATOR TRANSITION

Let us ﬁrst provide the arguments in favor of present
use of Gibbs statistics. Since the experimental observa-
tions concern the gate-based 2D system, we represent in
Fig.2 the sketch of the galvanic scheme and, moreover,
the related band diagram of typical Si-MOSFET struc-
ture. The latter is assumed to operate in strong inversion
regime. The applied gate voltage results in shift of Fermi
level of 2D system with respect to that of the metal gate.
The carrier density is given by the number of occupied
states below Fermi level counted from the bottom of the
lowest subband of triangular quantum well. In thermo-
dynamic equilibrium the applied gate voltage is equal
to electrostatic potential of the gate to channel capaci-
tor, the chemical potential of 2D system µ/e and, ﬁnally,
the ﬂat-band potential Ut = ∆W/e. Here, ∆W is the
constant diﬀerence of the work functions related to bulk
silicon and metal gate respectively. The gate voltage Ug,
shifted with respect to ﬂat-band potential Ut yields

Ug = Q/Cg + µ/e,

(2)

where Q = eN and Cg = ǫ/d is the charge density and
geometrical capacity of the MOS capacitor respectively.
Then, ǫ and d are the permittivity and thickness of the
dielectric layer respectively. According to Eq.(2), the in-
crease(decrease) of the gate voltage results in change of
the chemical potential and then, indirectly in varying of
2D carrier density itself. For strongly degenerated elec-
trons the second term in Eq.(2) can be ignored providing
the apparent evidence of 2D density changed by the gate
voltage. In contrast, for dilute 2D systems both terms
in the right side of Eq.(2) have to be accounted. We
therefore conclude that the applied gate voltage main-
tains the chemical potential of 2D system to be constant.
Consequently, the use of Gibbs statistics for 2D system
is justiﬁed.

In Ref.[15] low-T transport in dilute 2D systems has
been analyzed taking into account both the carrier de-
generacy and so-called thermal correction[16] owing to
Peltier and Seebeck thermoelectric eﬀects combined. For
standard ohmic measurements setup, the small applied
current causes heating(cooling) at the ﬁrst(second) sam-
ple contact due to the Peltier eﬀect. Under adiabatic
conditions the temperature gradient is linear in current,
the contact temperatures are diﬀerent. The measured
voltage consists of the ohmic term and, moreover, in-
cludes Peltier eﬀect-induced thermoemf which is linear
in current. According to Ref.[15], the total measured re-
sistivity yields

ρtot = ρ(cid:0)1 + α2/L(cid:1) ,

where ρ = m

tems. Both the theory results and experimental data[3]
are shown in Fig.3. At ﬁrst, we are interested in the case
of Fermi level lying above the bottom of the conducting

served experimentally. The subsequent asymptotes for
total resistivity speciﬁed by Eq.(3) can be written as

Let us examine in details the behavior of 2D resistiv-

over, re-plot the experimental data[6] shown in Fig.3.

set[3] scaled in this manner is represented in Fig.3b. Re-
markably, the original two-order of magnitude range data
shrink to roughly unique curve. In addition, we put on
the same plot the result provided by theory. Indeed, for
hole density p = 0.64× 1011 cm−2 reported in Ref.[3] the
extrapolation T → 0 yields the resistivity ρ0 = 530Ω.
The respective carrier mobility µ = 1.85 × 105cm2/Vs
corresponds to Dingle temperature TD = 
kτ = 0.19K.
Consequently, in Fig.3,b we plot the dimensional depen-
dence of the product ρtotTm = h
2·0.78 w(T /Tm), where
e2
w(ξ) = (1 + α2/L)(ξF0(1/ξ))−1 is the universal function.
Data scaling result agrees with that provided by theory.
We now verify validity of our approach for diﬀerent
2D systems based on scaling procedure made of use in
Ref.[17]. The experimental data argued to exhibit a
certain universality as function of reduced temperature
T /Tm and using the dimensionless form ρtot−ρ0
. Note
ρm−ρ0
that in our notations the latter ratio is equal to 2(w− 1),
thus support the universality. Fig.5 represent the scal-
ing analysis[17] for diﬀerent 2D systems. Additionally, in
Fig.5 we put the result of calculations within our theory.
The coincidence between theory and experiment is rather
impressive.

Further progress in verifying whether our model is cor-
rect concerns the high-T dependence of the resistivity.
Inverting Eq.(5) we obtain the linear dependence of in-

4

GaAs system[3].

Finally, we consider the most intriguing case of Fermi
level laying below the bottom of the conducting band,
i.e. when ξ < 0. This regime corresponds to portion
of data below green line seperatix in Fig.4. For actual
strong insulating case |ξ| ≪ 1 the 2D density is exponen-
tially small ∼ |ξ| exp(−1/|ξ|), while the the thermopower

behavior yields the Boltzman form α ∼ k

obtain the asymptote for 2D resistivity as it follows

In order to compare our results with experimental data,

expected, the curves demonstrate the progressive change
from high-T linear trend to low-T activated behavior.

The estimates for temperature coeﬃcient B are summa-
rized in Table II being in agreement with theory predic-
tions. Note that zero Fermi energy case µ = 0 (see green

In conclusion, we demonstrate that Wigner solidiﬁca-
tion has been never achieved in experiments dealt with
apparent metal to insulator transition. The observed
anomalies of 2D transport behavior is explained within
conventional Fermi gas formalism invoking the important
correction to measured resistivity caused by Peltier and
Seebeck eﬀects combined. We represent the experimental
evidence conﬁrming the solidity and universality of the
above model.
