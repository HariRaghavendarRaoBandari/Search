Solving the long-standing discrepancy in the Microlensing Optical

Depth Toward the Galactic Bulge by correcting the stellar

number count

T. Sumi1, M. T. Penny2,3

ABSTRACT

We ﬁnd that signiﬁcant incompleteness in stellar number counts results in a
signiﬁcant overestimate of the microlensing optical depth τ and event rate per star
per year Γ toward the Galactic bulge from the ﬁrst two years of MOA-II survey.
We ﬁnd that the completeness in Red Clump Giant (RCG) counts fRC decreases
proportional to the galactic latitude b, as fRC = (0.63±0.11)−(0.052±0.028)×b,
ranging 1-0.7 at b = −6◦ ∼ −1.5◦. This caused overestimates in τ and Γ. The
previous measurements with all source by Diﬀerence Image Analysis (DIA) by
MACHO and MOA-I suﬀer the same bias due to their relatively poor seeing. On
the other hand, the measurements with RCG sample by OGLE-II, MACHO and
EROS were free from this bias because they selected only the events associated
to the resolved stars. Thus, the incompleteness both in the number of events
and stellar number count cancel out. We estimate τ and Γ by correcting this
incompleteness. In the central ﬁelds with |l| < 5◦, we ﬁnd an event rates of Γ =
[18.74±0.91]×10−6 exp[(0.53±0.05)(3−|b|)] star−1 yr−1 and an optical depth (for
events with tE ≤ 200 days) of τ200 = [1.84 ± 0.14] × 10−6 exp[(0.44 ± 0.07)(3 − |b|)]
for the 427 events using all sources brighter than Is ≤ 20 mag. Our revised all-
source sample optical depth measurements are about 2-σ smaller than the other
measurements with all-source and consistent with the RCG measurement from
OGLE-II, MACHO and EROS within 1-σ. We conclude that the long-standing
problem on discrepancy between the high optical depth with all source by DIA
and low optical depth with RCG sample can be explained by the incompleteness
of the stellar number count. A model ﬁt to these measurements predicts Γ =
4.60 ± 0.25 × 10−5 star−1 yr−1 at |b| ∼ −1◦.4 and −2◦.25 < l < 3◦.75 for sources
with I < 20, where the future space mission WFIRST will observe.

Introduction

The gravitational microlensing optical depth and the event rate toward the Galactic
Bulge (GB) are known to be useful observables for the study of the stellar mass function
and the structure and kinematics of the Galaxy, as these quantities, in addition to the
microlensing timescale distribution are related to the masses and velocities of lens objects
(Paczy´nski 1991, Griest et al. 1991, Novati et al. 2008). Currently, the microlensing survey
groups: MOA-II1, OGLE-IV2, WiSE3 (Shvartzvald & Maoz 2012) and KMTNet (Kim et al.
2010) are detecting a couple of thousands of microlensing events every year toward the GB.

The magniﬁcation of a microlensing event is described by the minimum impact param-
eter (u0) in units of Einstein radius RE(M, Ds, Dl), the time of maximum magniﬁcation (t0),
the Einstein radius crossing time (or timescale) (tE = RE/vt), where vt is the transverse ve-
locity of the lens relative to the line of sight, M is the lens mass, Ds and Dl are the distance
to the source and the lens, respectively (Paczy´nski 1986).

The microlensing optical depth, τ is the probability that any given source star is mag-
niﬁed by more than 1.34 (corresponding to the source being inside the Einstein ring disk of
the lens) at any given time. This is directly related to the mass density of compact objects
along the line of sight (Paczy´nski 1996). Theoretically, it is simpler than the microlens-
ing event rate, because it doesn’t depend on the lens mass and lens-source relative velocity
distribution. τ can be determined observationally from the following expression,

τ =

π

tE,i

ε(tE,i)

where Ns is the total number of source stars monitored for microlensing, To is the duration
of the survey in days, tE,i is the Einstein radius crossing time for the i-th event, and ε(tE,i) is
the detection eﬃciency at that time-scale. Because long tE events give a large contribution
to τ , we present observed optical depth with a subscript, which indicates the maximum tE
value allowed by each analysis.

The previous Galactic bulge microlensing optical depth results have been somewhat

controversial (see details in Sumi et al. 2013). The ﬁrst measurements of the optical depth,
τ100 ∼ 3.3 × 10−6 by OGLE (Udalski et al. 1994) and τ150 ∼ 3.9+1.8
−1.2 × 10−6 by MACHO
(Alcock et al. 1997), were well above the predictions of τ ∼ 5 × 10−7 (Paczy´nski 1991;
Griest et al. 1991) and τ ∼ 8.5 × 10−7 (Kiraga & Paczy´nski 1994). The later studies based
on Diﬀerence Image Analysis (DIA), which is less sensitive to the systematics of blending
in crowded ﬁelds, also found relatively large values of τ150 ∼ 2.5 × 10−6 (at b ∼ −3.◦5) by
MACHO (Alcock et al. 2000) and MOA (Sumi et al. 2003).

To explain high optical depths, the presence of a bar oriented along our line of sight to the
GB have been suggested (Paczy´nski et al. 1994; Zhao, Spergel & Rich 1995;Han & Gould
2003; Zhao & Mao 1996; Peale 1998; Gyuk 1999). But their predictions range τ = 0.8 −
2.0 × 10−6 and are diﬃcult to explain the observed high optical depths.

Alcock et al. (1997) raised the possibility of a systematic bias in the optical depth
measurement due to the degeneracy between tE and u0 in relatively low signal-to-noise
ratio (S/N) events when the source base-line ﬂux is unknown due to the blending (c.f.
Wo´zniak & Paczy´nski 1997; Han 1999; Bond et al. 2001; Gould & An 2002).

Popowski et al. (2001) proposed that optical depth may be estimated without any bias
due to blending by using only events with bright source stars, such as Red Clump Giants
(RCG), in which the blending might be negligible, rather than using all sources including the
faint sources as in previous studies. Except one high value by Alcock et al. (1997), the other
measurements based on events with bright sources result lower optical depths by EROS
(Afonso et al. 2003), by MACHO (Popowski et al. 2005), and EROS (Hamadache et al.
2006).

However, Popowski et al. (2005) and Hamadache et al. (2006) realized that lensing of a
fainter star that is unresolved from the bright star are common. But they also noted that this
would increase the apparent number of bright star events, while it also make tE shorter and
these two eﬀects would nearly cancel, so that it does not cause large bias in the optical depth.
Sumi et al. (2006) and Smith, Wo´zniak, Mao & Sumi (2007) conﬁrmed this cancelation by
image level simulations. They also measured the bulge optical depth from OGLE-II for RCG
sources with high S/N light curves, which allowed to determine the source brightness and
excluded events with faint sources. Thus, they do not rely on the lucky cancelation of the
biases. Their result was consistent with the MACHO and EROS values. These values are
consistent with predictions based on the revised COBE bar model by Han & Gould (1995),
which has a mass of Mbulge = 1.62 × 1010M⊙ and the viewing angle φ ∼ 20◦, and the latest
COBE elongated bar model by Bissantz & Gerhard (2002) with φ ∼ 20◦.

Although the optical depth diﬀerence between the RCG sources and the all sources

– 4 –

by DIA are not very signiﬁcant due their large errors, the DIA optical depth values are
systematically larger than the RCG values. The reason for this is not well understood.

Sumi et al. (2013) made optical depth measurements using samples of 83 RCG events
and 474 all source events with well measured parameters from the DIA analysis of MOA-
II data. This is the largest sample ever used for the optical depth measurement. Their
optical depth measurement for all sources was in-between those of previous measurements,
i.e., lower than all source samples and higher than RCG samples and concluded that previous
discrepancy between all source sample and RCG sample were just a statistical ﬂuctuation.

Sumi et al. (2013) pointed a possible problem on using the same luminosity function in
all ﬁelds as the one in Baade’s window for estimating the number of sources at small level.
But they did not consider the completeness of stellar number counts used to normalize that
luminosity function. A systematic bias in the number counts of source stars will aﬀect the
measured optical depth. We investigate this point in this paper.

The event rate per star per year Γ is also aﬀected by the same bias. This is important
for the future space-based microlensing survey (Bennett & Rhie 2002), like the exoplanet
microlensing survey planned for WFIRST (Green et al. 2012; Spergel et al. 2015) or Euclid
(Penny et al. 2013)

In this paper we estimate the completeness of the number count of the source stars and
revise the measurement of the microlensing event rate and optical depth toward the GB
based on the ﬁrst two years of the MOA-II survey. We present the stellar number count in
section § 2 and its completeness in section § 3. We present the revised event rate and optical
depth results in section § 4. In section § 5 and § 6 , we model the distribution of the optical
depth and event rate with galactic coordinates. The discussion and conclusions are given in
section § 7,

2. Stellar number count.

2.1. MOA Stellar number count

We use the same dataset as Sumi et al. (2013) which used the data taken in the 2006
and 2007 seasons by the MOA-II survey, with the 1.8-m MOA-II telescope located at the
Mt. John University Observatory, New Zealand. The telescope is equipped with the mosaic
CCD camera, MOA-cam3 (Sako et al. 2008), which has 2.18 deg2 ﬁeld of view (FOV) with
the pixel scale of 0.58 arcsec/pixel. The median seeing for this dataset was ∼ 2.0′′.

The centers of 22 GB ﬁelds of MOA-II survey are listed in Table 1. The images were

– 5 –

taken using the custom MOA-Red wide-band ﬁlter, which is equivalent to the sum of the
standard Kron/Cousins R and I-bands. The average instrumental magnitudes of the MOA
reference images were roughly calibrated to the Kron/Cousins I-band using OGLE-II pho-
tometry map of the Galactic bulge (Udalski et al. 2002) within ∼0.2 mag. V -band images
were taken occasionally in order to make instrumental color-magnitude diagrams (CMD).

The images were reduced with MOA’s implementation (Bond et al. 2001) of the diﬀer-
ence image analysis (DIA) method (Tomany & Crotts 1996; Alard & Lupton 1998; Alard
2000). In the DIA method, a high-quality, good-seeing reference image is subtracted from
each observed image after matching the seeing and photometric scaling. This method pro-
vides precise relative photometry in the very stellar crowded Galactic bulge ﬁelds. A stellar
catalog was constructed from these reference images by applying DoPHOT (Schechter, Mateo & Saha
1993), the point spread function (PSF)-ﬁtting routine.

Each ﬁeld is divided into 80 subﬁelds and each subﬁeld is individually calibrated using
the RCG feature in each subﬁeld CMD more precisely. About 12% of the area, in which a
clear RCG population could not be identiﬁed in the CMD, was excluded from the analysis.
The number of subﬁelds used in the ﬁnal analysis is 1536 in total and also given in Table 1
for each ﬁeld. The coordinates and other information of subﬁelds are listed in Table 4.

For the microlensing rate and optical depth estimates, we use two subsamples of events

and star counts:

(1) The all-source sample uses stars brighter than Is ≤ 20 mag. This sample contains
474 events. (Sumi et al. 2013) did not require the events to be associated with an apparently
resolved reference image stars, but require the source magnitude is determined from the light
curve ﬁt and it is brighter than Is = 20 mag. Analysis of these samples is less aﬀected by the
blending, in the same way as previous all source DIA analysis (Sumi et al. 2003; Alcock et al.
2000). However, the analysis requires that the number of sources be counted independently
from the event selection.

The GB ﬁelds are so crowded that virtually all the main sequence stars are not in-
dividually resolved. To count the number of stars with I ≤ 20, Sumi et al. (2013) ﬁrst
estimated the center of RCG I-band magnitude, IRC, and the number of RCG, NRC, by
ﬁtting the magnitude distribution of the reference images in each subﬁeld with Equation
(4) of Nataf et al. (2013). RCG stars are abundant and serve as a good standard candle
(Kiraga, Paczy´nski & Stanek 1997; Stanek et al. 2000) that trace out the density structure
of the GB, and hence their numbers should be proportional to the number of all sources.

Sumi et al. (2013) then constructed a combined luminosity function (LF) by using the
star catalogs measured in Baade’s Window using the MOA-II reference image for bright stars,

– 6 –

and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging (Holtzman et al. 1998) for faint stars down to
I = 24 mag. This combined LF is calibrated to the extinction and GB distance, and
normalized for each subﬁeld so that its IRC and NRC are same as the values in each subﬁeld.
Then the number of stars Ns are counted down to I = 20 mag by this scaled-combined LF
as shown in Table 1.

The disadvantage of this method is that it assumes that the LF in all ﬁelds are same
as that of Baade’s window (Holtzman et al. 1998). The advantage of this method is that
it was believed that faint sources can be counted without blending problem, because NRC
is less aﬀected by the blending as they are bright. However, below, we show that NRC
does suﬀer from incompleteness and that this method is not tolerant against this bias for the
measurements of τ and Γ because the number of events is not aﬀected by this incompleteness.

(2) The Red Clump Giant (RCG) sample selects only events with Is < 17.5, as measured
from the lightcurve. To estimate the number of sources, stars in the ”extended RCG region”
are counted in the CMD of the reference images as shown in Figure 1 of (Sumi et al. 2013)
with Is < 17.5 mag and the source colors of (V − I)s ≥ (V − I)RC − 0.3 mag, where
(V − I)RC is the V − I color of RCG centroid. There is no color cut on the event selection,
but it is assumed that the blue disk sources in front of the bulge have negligible event rate.
This process is similar to the OGLE-II optical depth analysis (Sumi et al. 2006) that makes
use of the OGLE-II extinction map (Sumi 2004), which is based on the RCG position in the
CMD. This contains not only RCGs but also bulge red giants, which is a similar deﬁnition as
previous works (Alcock et al. 1997; Popowski et al. 2005; Sumi et al. 2006; Hamadache et al.
2006). This sample contains 83 events.

Contrary to previous RCG analyses (Alcock et al. 1997; Popowski et al. 2005; Sumi et al.
2006; Hamadache et al. 2006), Sumi et al. (2013) did not require the event to be associated
with an apparently resolved star. So this method is closer to the all source sample analysis
above than the previous RCG analysis. Thus their MOA-II RCG analysis are less aﬀected
by the blending, but aﬀected by the same incompleteness bias as all source analysis. On the
other hand, the incompleteness of source star count did not aﬀect the previous RCG analysis
because the incompleteness in event selection and source count cancel out (see more details
in § 7).

2.2. OGLE Stellar number count

The Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE; Udalski 2003) also conducts a
microlensing survey toward the Galactic bulge with the 1.3 m Warsaw telescope at the Las

– 7 –

Campanas Observatory in Chile. The median seeing is about 1.3 arcsec. The third phase
of OGLE, OGLE-III carried out survey observations with a 0.36 deg2 FOV mosaic CCD
camera. Most observations are taken in the standard Kron-Cousin I-band with occasional
observations in the Johnson V -band.

Nataf et al. (2013) identiﬁed RCGs in the CMDs by using OGLE-III photometry maps
towards the galactic bulge ﬁelds (Szyma´nski et al. 2011) 3 which cover −10◦ < l < 10◦ and
2◦ < |b| < 7◦. Each of the 2104 OGLE-III subﬁelds (eight detectors over 263 ﬁelds) used in
the work was split into 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 10, 15, or 21 rectangles depending on the surface density
of stars. The average rectangle size is 6′ × 6′. In each rectangle, they estimated the center
of RCG I-band magnitude, IRC, and the number of RCG, NRC by ﬁtting the Luminosity
function with Equation (4) of Nataf et al. (2013).

Thanks to their better seeing and longer exposure than MOA-II, the completeness of
their RCG number count is much higher than that of MOA-II catalog and almost complete.

3. Completeness of Stellar Number Count

We investigate the completeness of the number count of RCGs in the MOA-II GB ﬁelds
used in Sumi et al. (2013), NRC,MOA, by comparing to that of OGLE-III (Nataf et al. 2013),
NRC,Nataf.

Figure 1 shows comparison of the number of RCG per subﬁeld (98 min.2) in MOA
(NRC,MOA) at |l| < 5◦ and the that in OGLE (NRC,Nataf ) which are an average over points
within 0.085 degrees of the MOA subﬁeld center. One can see that they are consistent at
low number density NRC < 1000, but as the stellar density increases, NRC,MOA becomes
systematically smaller by up to 30%. This trend is as expected because the completeness
depends on the stellar number density, but the magnitude of the diﬀerence is signiﬁcantly
larger than anticipated by previous studies, and this could bias the measured τ and Γ.

The scatter in Figure 1 is about 10%.

In principle, if both data sets were equally
complete, there should be no scatter between the two. The Poisson uncertainty on the
number of stars that are missed in the MOA data is expected to be a few percent. The
variation of incompleteness in diﬀerent subﬁelds can generate additional scatter. We also
expect that some scatter is caused by the averaging of Nataf et al.’s subﬁelds in order to
match a MOA subﬁeld, together with the fact that the sky covered by the averaged Nataf
et al. subﬁelds is not exactly the same as the sky covered by the MOA subﬁeld.

– 8 –

Figure 2 shows the counts as a function of galactic latitude b. One can see that they are
consistent at higher galactic latitude around b ∼ −6, but NRC,MOA is systematically fewer
than NRC,Nataf at lower b as the number density is higher near the galactic center.

The completeness of RCG counts is expected to depend not only on the number den-
sity, but also the RCG magnitude, which depends on the interstellar extinction and the
distance to the galactic bar structure. The top panel of Figure 3 shows the ratio, fRC =
NRC,MOA/NRC,Nataf i.e., the completeness if we assume that NRC,Nataf is complete, as a func-
tion of the I-band RCG magnitude measured by Nataf et al. (2013), INataf and of NRC,Nataf .
One can see that fRC is basically higher for brighter INataf and smaller NRC,Nataf as expected,
but the trend is somewhat complicated. The middle and bottom panels of Figure 3 show
fRC in (b, NRC,Nataf) and (b, IRC,Nataf) space, respectively. Both NRC,Nataf and IRC,Nataf have
clear relation with b, which explain the clear trend of NRCs on b in Figure 2. In the top
and middle panels of Figure 3, one can see that the fRC are systematically higher at smaller
NRC,Nataf at given IRC,Nataf and b. Some fraction of this trend can be attributed to the bias
due to the statistical uncertainty of NRC,Nataf itself.

In order to correct the number counts for incompleteness, we ﬁt for relations between
fRC as a function of NRC,Nataf , IRC,Nataf and b; these are shown in Figure 4, Figure 5 and
the top-left panel of Figure 6, respectively. Here we conduct the linear ﬁts with recursive 3σ
clipping. In all ﬁgures, we can see clear trends with the standard deviations after (before)
3σ clipping are 0.10 (0.13), 0.11 (0.14) and 0.10 (0.13), respectively. Thus the relation with
NRC,Nataf and b are better than that of IRC,Nataf. As the aim of the this comparison is to
correct the number counts for the completeness, it could bias the result if we use NRC,Nataf
itself to correct for it as they have their own uncertainty as mentioned above. Thus we
decided to use the relation,

fRC =

NRC,MOA
NRC,Nataf

= (0.63 ± 0.01) − (0.052 ± 0.003) × b.

(2)

In Figure 6, we also show fRC as a function of b with the galactic longitude of |l| ≤ 2◦,
2◦ < |l| ≤ 5◦ and |l| > 5◦, respectively. One can see that this relations do not depend on the
galactic longitude. So we apply the relation of Eq. (2) for all subﬁelds.

If there is a signiﬁcant systematics in IRC,MOA, then it could also cause the bias in
the number count of sources for all source sample. It is possible that the incompleteness
of the RCG mentioned above might bias IRC,MOA.
In this work, we were unable to ﬁnd
a strong correlation between diﬀerences between IRC,MOA and IRC,Nataf and any parameter,
but the lack of correlation may be due to a random uncertainty in calibration between
OGLE and MOA magnitudes which is less than ∼0.2 mag. We estimated that the possible

– 9 –

systematics due to this bias should be less than 10% and should be smaller than our statistical
uncertainties. See more discussions in §7.

4. Microlensing Optical Depth and Event Rate

Here we calculated the microlensing optical depth and Event Rate by following Sumi et al.

(2013), but using the stellar number count corrected for the completeness by Eq.(2).

The optical depth, τ , can be calculated by using Eq. (1). The microlensing event rate

per star per year, Γ, can be determined observationally from the following expression,

Γ =

1

NsTo

X

i

1

ε(tE,i)

,

(3)

Here we use the detection eﬃciency determined by Sumi et al. (2011). In our event rate and
optical depth analyses for this 2006-2007 data set, To = 596.0 days and the corrected number
of source stars is (1) N∗ = 110.3 × 106 for all source sample and (2) N∗,RC = 8.00 × 106 for
the RCG sample.

Individual optical depth estimates for all sources in each ﬁeld are listed in Table 1. The
upper panel of Figure 7 shows a smoothed map of optical depth of each subﬁeld in Galactic
coordinates. The plotted values from all subﬁelds are listed in Table 4 of the online version,
with a sample of this table listed in the printed version of this paper. The smoothing is
done with a Gaussian function with σ = 0.4◦, and cut oﬀ at a distance of 1◦ from the center
of each subﬁeld. The error bars for each subﬁeld are estimated using a bootstrap method
of Alcock et al. (1997) using the neighboring subﬁelds with the same weighting as in the
calculation of the central values.

We also estimated the average optical depth in all ﬁelds combined, and found τ200 =
1.53+0.12
−0.11 × 10−6 with 474 events for all source sample and τ200 = 1.28+0.27
−0.19 × 10−6 with 83
events for RCG sample at (l, b) = (1.◦85, −3.◦69). The eﬀective line of sight was computed
by weighting the number of subﬁelds used. The errors were estimated using the bootstrap
Monte-Carlo method of Alcock et al. (1997).

5. Modeling the Optical Depth Results

The optical depth given by Equation (1) does not follow Poisson statistics because each
event is summed with a unequal weight of tE,i/ε(tE,i). Therefore, we binned the optical depth
values of subﬁelds to model the optical depth distribution.

– 10 –

Figure 8 shows the optical depth, τ200, as a function of b for both the all-source sample
and RCG samples for the central region with |l| < 5◦ to overlap with previous measurements.
The subﬁeld results are binned by the width of ∆b = 0.5◦. The binned values for all-source
and RCG sample are given in Tables 2 and 3, respectively.

The optical depth clearly increases with decreasing |b|, and a simple exponential ﬁt gives,
τ200 = [1.84 ± 0.14] × 10−6 exp[(0.44 ± 0.07)(3 − |b|)] for the all-source sample as indicated
by the black solid line in Figure 8. This is signiﬁcantly lower and shallower slope than the
original result of τ200 = [2.35±0.18]×10−6 exp[(0.51±0.07)(3−|b|)] estimated by Sumi et al.
(2013) before correcting the completeness of the RCG number count. The exponential model
still represent the data well.

This result is signiﬁcantly smaller than the measurements by MOA-I (Sumi et al. 2003)
and MACHO (Alcock et al. 2000) with all-source samples. Contrary to the original mea-
surements, it is very consistent with the RCG measurements by MACHO (Popowski et al.
2005), EROS-2 (Hamadache et al. 2006) and OGLE-II (Sumi et al. 2006). The best linear
ﬁt to the OGLE-II RCG measurements is indicated by the red dashed line in Figure 8 as a
comparison.

The MACHO (Popowski et al. 2005) and EROS (Hamadache et al. 2006) analyses iden-
tiﬁed microlensing events solely by their proximity to apparent RCG stars identiﬁed in the
reference images, with no attempt to determine if the source is a RCG star or a blended
fainter main sequence star. These blending eﬀects will shrink apparent tE values for all
events, while increasing the number of apparent RCG events. Popowski et al. (2005) and
Hamadache et al. (2006) make arguments to suggest that these two eﬀects approximately
cancel.

The only previous RCG sample that distinguished RCG source events from events with
main sequence sources that happened to be blended with RCG stars was the OGLE-II
analysis of Sumi et al. (2006). I.e., they are less aﬀected by the blending contrary to the
above MACHO and EROS RCG analysis. The one similarity of their RCG analysis with
other RCG analysis is that they require that events are associated with resolved stars.
Their OGLE-II value is consistent with MACHO and EROS RCG analysis. Thus it is
likely that this cancellation of shrinking tE and increasing the number of events, works to
within the accuracy presented in their analysis, as conﬁrmed by image level simulation by
Smith, Wo´zniak, Mao & Sumi (2007).

An exponential ﬁt for the optical depth toward RCG sources gives τ200 = [1.28 ± 0.21] ×
10−6 exp[(0.40 ± 0.17)(3 − |b|)], which is indicated by the red solid line in the Figure 8.
This is also signiﬁcantly lower than the original estimate and previous RCG measurements

– 11 –

(Popowski et al. 2005; Sumi et al. 2006; Hamadache et al. 2006) and some older bulge models
(Bissantz & Gerhard 2002; Han & Gould 2003; Kerins, Robin & Marshal 2009).

However, in this particular analysis, this τ estimates for RCG is heavily biased by the
low eﬃciency for events with tE > 100 days, due to the fact that the analysis was originally
designed to focus on short timesscale events. Although the events with tE < 200days are
selected, most of the events with tE > 100 days with bright sources could not satisfy the
requirement for long enough constant baseline. This is because the tails of the events are
longer than tE and they are still signiﬁcantly above the baseline for bright source events.
This eﬀect is negligible for the all source sample. Thus we can not directly compare this
result with other measurements.

6. Modeling the Event Rate

The event rate per square degree per year, Γdeg2, for source stars above a magnitude
threshold of Is ≤ 20, which are given in Table 1-4 for completeness, does not change from
Sumi et al. (2013) because this quantity is independent of the stellar number count. Thus,
we focus on the event rate per star per year, Γ, in the rest of the paper.

We model the event rate, Γ by using the Poisson statistics ﬁtting method, ﬁrst intro-
duced by Sumi et al. (2013). This method allows us to ﬁt to the raw, subﬁeld data, even
though the average number of events per subﬁeld is < 1, thus free from the problem on the
binning of the sample and the improper assumption of the gaussian statistics. The number
of expected events in a subﬁeld is given by

Nev,exp(l, b) = Γmod(l, b)Ns(l, b)Tohε(l, b)i ,

(4)

where Ns is the number of stars in the subﬁeld, and hε(l, b)i is the detection eﬃciency
averaged over tE for the subﬁeld at coordinates (l, b). We adopt the average detection
eﬃciency given in Tables 2 and 3 of Sumi et al. (2013), for the all-star and RCG samples,
respectively, while Ns need to be corrected by Eq. (2).

The probability of the observed number of events, Nev(l, b), in the subﬁeld at (l, b) is

P [Nev(l, b)] =

e−Nev,exp(l,b)Nev,exp(l, b)Nev(l,b)

Nev(l, b)!

,

(5)

according to Poisson statistics. We can then deﬁne the χ2 by, χ2 = −2 P(l,b) ln P [Nev(l, b)].
Thus the event rate, Γ, is the preferred quantity to compare to Galactic models than
the optical depth. We show the event rate per star per year Γ and the exponential ﬁts for

– 12 –

the all-source and RCG samples as a function of the galactic latitude, b, for |l| < 5◦ in Figure
9 and in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. The event rate has much less scatter than τ200 and Γ
for both the all-source and RCG samples are well ﬁt by a simple exponential model. Note
that these ﬁts are done to the subﬁeld data using the Poisson statistics method, while the
plots are binned for display in Figure 9 and in Tables 2 and 3.

The exponential model for the all-source and RCG samples are quite similar with Γall =
[18.74 ± 0.91] × 10−6 exp[(0.53 ± 0.05)(3 − |b|)] star−1yr−1 for the all-source sample and ΓRC =
[17.13 ± 2.03] × 10−6 exp[(0.58 ± 0.12)(3 − |b|)] star−1yr−1 for the RCG sample. Again, due
to the Ns correction, these have a smaller and shallower slope than the original values in
Sumi et al. (2013). The RCG event rate is slightly smaller, but consistent with the all-source
event rate. The RCG slope is 0.4σ steeper and the amplitude is is 8% or 0.8σ smaller. As
noted earlier, this is because Γ is much less sensitive to the bias due to the small number of
long tE events.

Sumi et al. (2013) noted that although there is a possible problem with assuming the
luminosity function in all other ﬁelds are same as the HST luminosity function measured in
Baade’s window (Holtzman et al. 1998), the uncertainty due to the diﬀerent luminosity func-
tion shape would largely cancel out if the same luminosity function is used in the detection
eﬃciency simulations and the source star counts. The consistency between the all-source
and RCG Γ values indicates that the eﬀect due to the variation of the luminosity function
shape in each ﬁeld from the HST luminosity function are negligible. However, they were not
aware that the eﬀect on the normalization of the luminosity function is more signiﬁcant than
its shape.

We show exponential ﬁts as a function of the galactic latitude b for τ200 and Γ for
diﬀerent bins in Galactic longitude, l in Figures 10 and 11, respectively. The black points
and curves are for all the events with −2◦.25 < l < 3◦.75, and it provides a reasonable ﬁt
to all the longitude bins, except the 0◦.75 < l < 2◦.25 bin, where there is an enhancement
to the rate. However, the τ200 with 0◦.75 < l < 2◦.25 bin at small |b| is smaller than the
average, which is diﬀerent from the Γ. This is because average tE is smaller at these galactic
central regions due to the galactic kinematics as shown in Fig. 3 of Sumi et al. (2013).

Figure 7 shows smoothed maps of τ200 and Γ in the Galactic coordinates. The plotted
values from all subﬁelds are listed in Table 4. The smoothing is done with a Gaussian
function with σ = 0.4◦, and cut oﬀ at a distance of 1◦ from the center of each subﬁeld. The
error bars for each subﬁeld are estimated using a bootstrap method using the neighboring
subﬁelds with the same weighting as in the calculation of the central values. They are similar
to the original maps in Fig. 3 of Sumi et al. (2013), but decreased up to ∼ 40% depending
on b. The highest optical depth is found at l ≈ 3◦ and this is due to the excess of long

– 13 –

timescale events at this longitude, and could be due to the statistical ﬂuctuations enhanced
by large weight for long events.

The event rate per star, Γ have a peak at l ≈ 1◦. Because these event rate measurements
obey Poisson statistics, the statistical uncertainty in Γ is smaller than the uncertainty in τ200.
So, we expect that this l ≈ 1◦ enhancement in the microlensing rate is real and that it is
related to the structure and kinematics of the bulge.

As a comparison to Sumi et al. (2013), we have ﬁt Γ with a 16-parameter model in l
and b. The 16 parameters consist of a 10-parameter cubic polynomial and the inverse of a
6-parameter quadratic polynomial. That is

Γ = a0 + a1l + a2b + a3l2 + a4lb + a5b2 + a6l3 + a7l2b + a8lb2 + a9b3

+ 1/(a10 + a11l + a12b + a13l2 + a14lb + a15b2) .

(6)

The best ﬁt model is shown in Figure 12 and the model parameters are listed in Table 5.
The model show the maximum at l ≈ 1◦ that was also evident in Figure 7.

7. Discussion and conclusions

We examined the completeness of the stellar number count in the measurement of the
microlensing optical depth τ and event rate per star per year Γ toward the Galactic bulge
from the ﬁrst two years of the MOA-II survey (Sumi et al. 2013). We found the signiﬁcant
incompleteness in MOA-II’s RCG counts which is proportional to the galactic b ranging from
1 to 0.7 at b = −6◦ ∼ −1.5◦. The counts are less complete at lower |b| because of the higher
stellar number density and the higher interstellar extinction. This incompleteness caused
the overestimates in the τ and Γ.

By correcting this incompleteness, we estimated τ and Γ with the all source sample of
474 events and a RCG sample of 83 events. Note that our RCG optical depth is known
to be biased low, due to the low eﬃciency for long duration bright events. Thus we focus
on τ with all source sample in the following discussion. Due to this correction, both τ
and Γ decreased at lower |b| as follows. This results may have solved the previously noted
diﬀerence between the optical depth measured with RCG samples (Popowski et al. 2005;
Sumi et al. 2006; Hamadache et al. 2006) and samples of faint stars from DIA (Alcock et al.
2000; Sumi et al. 2003). The faint star analyses have shown systematically larger τ values.

The original measurement of τ with all source by MOA-II (Sumi et al. 2013) were in-
between of the other previous measurements with all-source and RCG sample and consistent
within 1 or 2-σ level. Thus they concluded that the previously seen diﬀerence between the

– 14 –

all-source and RCG samples was due to statistical ﬂuctuations.

However, our revised all-source optical depth measurements are consistent with previous
measurements for RCG samples and signiﬁcantly lower than that of the Sumi et al. (2013)
all-source sample as shown in Figure 8. We can use the exponential models shown in Figure
8 to interpolate our measurement to the center of previous samples. For the MACHO DIA
all-source result at b = −3◦.35 (Alcock et al. 2000), we ﬁnd τ200 = [1.58 ± 0.13] × 10−6 which
is 2.1-σ smaller than the MACHO result of τ = 2.43 +0.39
−0.38 × 10−6. The MOA-I all-source
result (Sumi et al. 2003), centered at b = −3◦.8, is τ = 2.59 +0.84
−0.64 × 10−6. This compares
to our interpolated value of τ200 = [1.29 ± 0.11] × 10−6, which is 1.7-σ smaller. Thus, our
revised optical depth measurement is smaller at the ∼ 2-σ level than both the previous all-
source measurements, which suggests that these measurements also suﬀer the same bias in
the stellar number count. Because Alcock et al. (2000); Sumi et al. (2003) used the similar
method as this work, it is very likely that they have similar bias.

The MACHO Collaboration published several averages of their results (Popowski et al.
2005), but we compare to their “CGR+3” average of 6 deg2 centered at b = −2◦.73. MA-
CHO reports τ = 2.37 +0.47
−0.39 × 10−6 for RCG sources at this position. This compares to our
interpolated all-source value of τ200 = [2.08 ± 0.17] × 10−6, which is just 0.6-σ smaller.

The RCG sample of the EROS Collaboration (Hamadache et al. 2006) covers a slightly
larger area than the MOA-II analysis. They ﬁt their results to an exponential model that
is identical to the one shown in Figure 8, and they ﬁnd τ = [1.62 ± 0.23] × 10−6 exp[(0.43 ±
0.16)(3 − |b|)]. This has a slope that is consistent with our ﬁts, so we compare the results
by simply comparing the normalization parameters. Our normalization parameter is [1.84 ±
0.14] × 10−6, which is 0.8-σ larger than the EROS value of [1.62 ± 0.23] × 10−6. A more fair
comparison would be to compare to the the EROS ﬁt to a model ﬁt to all our ﬁelds, instead
of just those with |l| < 5◦. This gives τ200 = [1.74 ± 0.13] × 10−6 exp[(0.45 ± 0.07)(3 − |b|)],
which is 0.4-σ larger than the EROS value.

The OGLE-II RCG analysis (Sumi et al. 2006) found τ = 2.55 +0.57

−0.46 × 10−6 at b =
−2◦.75 which is consistent with other RCG analysis. This compares to our all-source result,
interpolated from the model given in Figure 8, is τ200 = [2.06 ± 0.17] × 10−6, which is just
0.9-σ smaller.

In summary, we ﬁnd that our all-source results are about 2-σ smaller than the previous
all-source measurements, and they are very consistent with the RCG optical depth values
from OGLE, MACHO and EROS within 1-σ.

We compare the optical depth results with values predicted from the models. Han & Gould

(2003) model predicts τ = [1.63 ± 0.13] × 10−6 at b = −3◦.9, where our all-source optical

– 15 –

depth τ200 = [1.24 ± 0.10] × 10−6 is 3.9-σ smaller. The values from Wood & Mao (2005)
models are τ = 2.1 × 10−6 at b = −3◦ and τ = 3.0 × 10−6 at b = −2◦. Our values
τ200 = [1.84 ± 0.15] × 10−6 and τ200 = [2.87 ± 0.24] × 10−6 agree with them with 1.7-σ and
0.5-σ, respectively. Evans & Belokurov (2002) present a number of models, and the value
of their “Dwek plus spiral structure” model τ = 1.5 × 10−6 at b = −3.8◦ agrees with our
τ200 = [1.29 ± 0.11] × 10−6 which is 1.9-σ smaller, while their other models predict much
higher optical depths. The models of Bissantz & Gerhard (2002) predict τ = 1.1 × 10−6 at
b = −3.35◦ for all sources and τ = 1.3 × 10−6 at b = −3.8◦ for RCG sources. Our values
τ200 = [1.58 ± 0.13] × 10−6 and τ200 = [1.29 ± 0.11] × 10−6 are 3.7-σ and 0.2-σ larger, re-
spectively. Kerins, Robin & Marshal (2009)’s model predicts τ = 4 × 10−6 at b = −1◦.9 and
τ = 2 × 10−6 at b = −3◦.5, where our measurements are τ200 = [3.00 ± 0.25] × 10−6 and
τ200 = [1.48 ± 0.12] × 10−6 which are 4.0-σ and 4.3-σ smaller, respectively.

As discussed above in Section 6 and shown in Figures 7 and 9, Γ can be measured more
precisely than τ . Furthermore, τ has an additional systematic uncertainty due to potential
very long time scale events, which may contribute signiﬁcantly to τ but not to Γ. Figure 9
indicates that the all-source and RCG Γ values diﬀer by only less than 9%.

Recently, Awiphan, Kerins & Robin (2016) presented the ﬁeld-by-ﬁeld comparison be-
tween results by Sumi et al. (2013) and the Besan¸con population synthesis Galactic model.
They found only ∼50% of the measured τ and event rate per star per year, Γ, at low Galac-
tic latitude around the inner bulge (|b| < 3◦) and suggested the discrepancy most likely is
associated with known underestimated extinction and star counts in the innermost regions,
which supports missing inner stellar population. Here we compared their model and our
revised τ and Γ, in Fig. 13 and 14, respectively. Our revised τ is more consistent to their
model than the original measurements by Sumi et al. (2013), while they are still slightly
higher. The diﬀerence is not very signiﬁcant due to the large error in our measurement. Our
revised Γ are very consistent to their model without any missing inner stellar population.

Sumi et al. (2013) noted a possible problem with assuming that the luminosity function
in all ﬁelds are same as the HST luminosity function in Baade’s window (Holtzman et al.
1998). However, the consistency between the all-source and RCG Γ values indicates that
the eﬀect due to the variation of the luminosity function shape in each ﬁeld from the HST
luminosity function are negligible.

However, Sumi et al. (2013) were not aware that the completeness of the number counts
of RCGs might be problematic, because they were thought to be bright enough to be com-
plete.
In their analysis for both all source sample and RCG sample, the stellar num-
ber count is based on the stellar catalog in the reference images reduced by DoPHOT
(Schechter, Mateo & Saha 1993) algorithm, where the combined ground+HST luminosity

– 16 –

function are normalized by the RCG number counts and the events were selected regardless
of whether they are associated with resolved stars. Thus, both samples are biased by the
same amount. This incompleteness is mostly because MOA-II data was taken under rela-
tively poor seeing of ∼ 1.8 arcsec even in the reference images. The measurements by MOA-I
(Sumi et al. 2003) and MACHO (Alcock et al. 2000) also used a similar method with similar
seeing, and are therefore expected to suﬀer the same problem.

Other measurements using RCG samples by OGLE-II (Sumi et al. 2006), MACHO
(Popowski et al. 2005) and EROS (Hamadache et al. 2006) used a diﬀerent method, which
selected only the events at the position of the resolved stars in the reference image by
DoPHOT or similar algorithm. Thus, the incompleteness aﬀects both the number of events
and stellar number count, thus they cancel each other out.

In conclusion, the long-standing problem of the discrepancy between the high optical
depth in all source sample by DIA and low optical depth with RCG sample can be explained
by the incompleteness of the stellar number count.

These measurements of Γ and τ have the highest spatial resolution so far thanks to our
samples being the largest studied so far. Our goal is to measure Γ and τ precisely around
the galactic bulge to constrain the barred Galactic bulge model. Currently MOA-II and
OGLE-IV detects about 700 and 2,000 events a year, respectively. In the near future, this
analysis will be expanded by thousands of events.

Another goal of this work is to predict the event rate in the inner Galactic bulge for
the future space microlensing survey of the Wide Field Infrared Space Telescope (WFIRST)
(Green et al. 2012; Spergel et al. 2015) and Euclid (Penny et al. 2013). The expected mi-
crolensing event rate for the WFIRST mission is uncertain because the region with the
highest event rate at the low galactic latitudes are not well studied due to the high interstel-
lar extinction. This work provides the best estimate of the event rate in the inner Galactic
bulge to date. For 3.2 deg2 of the MOA-II survey area inside |b| ≤ 3◦.0 and 0◦.0 ≤ l ≤ 2◦.0,
centered at (l, b) = (0.◦97, −2.◦26), we ﬁnd Γ = 3.41+0.38
−0.34 × 10−5 star−1 yr−1 for sources with
I < 20. This is consistent with the rate model used for the report of the WFIRST Science
Deﬁnition Team (SDT) (Green et al. 2012; Spergel et al. 2015) evaluated at this position,
while the previous value was a factor 1.3 larger than this. By extrapolating to the lower lati-
tude ﬁelds, |b| ∼ −1◦.4, where the WFIRST will observe, the model with −2◦.25 < l < 3◦.75
presented in Figure 11 predicts Γ = 4.60 ± 0.25 × 10−5 star−1 yr−1 for sources with I < 20.
which is consistent with the value in the WFIRST SDT report.

In this work, we have attempted to correct for incompleteness by assuming that an-
other data set is complete, when that data set itself has not been corrected for complete-

– 17 –

ness (Nataf et al. 2013). While we expect OGLE number counts to be more complete than
MOA’s, it was long assumed that completeness would not be an issue for MOA. This is of
course not ideal, but was done so for the sake of expediently correcting a signiﬁcant systematic
error. Instead, in future, it would be better for all studies that ﬁt models to number counts of
bulge RCG stars to ﬁrst correct for incompleteness using artiﬁcial star tests. Without doing
so it is possible that models ﬁt to the magnitude distribution around the red clump might
systematically underestimate the number of stars, as well as the location of the clump if the
incompleteness varies as a function of magnitude (which it almost certainly does). Failure to
do so could impact studies of galactic structure (e.g. Rattenbury et al. 2007; Cao et al. 2013;
Wegg & Gerhard 2013), interstellar extinction (Sumi 2004; Nataf et al. 2013; Gonzalez et al.
2011) and as we have shown here, microlensing event rates and optical depths.

Here we have only corrected for the eﬀect of incompleteness on the number of RCGs
and not for any eﬀect on the mean magnitude of the red clump. One reason for this is
because we were unable to ﬁnd a strong correlation between diﬀerences between IRC,MOA and
IRC,Nataf and any parameter, but the lack of correlation may be due to a signiﬁcant random
uncertainty in calibration between OGLE and MOA magnitudes. Were the uncertainty in
calibration to be reduced, it is possible that an additional systematic trend may emerge.
Should incompleteness be found to systematically aﬀect the measurement of IRC, then it
would aﬀect estimates of the event detection eﬃciency in a complicated way (unless this were
estimated and corrected for as a function of magnitude), in addition to aﬀecting estimates
of the number of sources. To see the magnitude of the bias due to the possible systematics
in IRC, we calculated the optical depth assuming that there is a correlation of IRC,MOA −
IRC,Nataf ∝ 0.05 × b. Here we assumed that the systematics is as large as the maximum
uncertainty of the calibration of 0.2 mag over the range b = −2 ∼ −6. We found that the
diﬀerence from the optical depth results without this bias is a few % or less than 10% at
max. Given the concordance of our updated optical depths with other data sets that would
not be aﬀected by this bias, we anticipate that the aﬀect of the bias is smaller than our
statistical uncertainties.

Fig. 1.—: The comparison of the number of red clump giants (RCG) per subﬁeld (98
min.2) in MOA, (NRC,MOA) and the that in OGLE, NRC,Nataf, which are an average over
points within 0.085 degrees of the MOA subﬁeld center.

– 22 –

Fig. 2.—: The number of RCG per subﬁeld (98 min.2) in MOA (NRC,MOA, blue open circle)
and that in OGLE (NRC,Nataf , red ﬁlled circle) which are an average over points within 0.085
degrees of the MOA subﬁeld center, as a function of the galactic latitude b.

– 23 –

Fig. 3.—: The number of RCG measured by MOA over that measured by OGLE, fRC =
NRC,MOA/NRC,Nataf (color-coded) of subﬁelds with |l| ≤ 5◦ in (IRC,Nataf, NRC,Nataf ) (top panel),
(b, NRC,Nataf) (midle panel) and (b, IRC,Nataf ) (bottom panel).

– 24 –

Fig. 4.—: The number of RCG measured by MOA over that measured by OGLE, fRC =
NRC,MOA/NRC,Nataf for subﬁelds with |l| ≤ 5◦ as a function of NRC,Nataf. The red lines indicate
the best ﬁt to the blue dots where 3σ outliers (green dots) are recursively rejected.

Fig. 5.—: The number of RCG by MOA over that by OGLE, fRC = NRC,MOA/NRC,Nataf of
subﬁelds with |l| ≤ 5◦ as a function of IRC,Nataf. The red lines indicate the best ﬁt by using
the blue dots where 3σ outliers (green dots) are recursively rejected.

– 25 –

Fig. 6.—: The number of RCG by MOA over that by OGLE, fRC = NRC,MOA/NRC,Nataf of
subﬁelds. The top-left, top-right, bottom-left and bottom-right panels are for subﬁelds with
the galactic longitude of |l| ≤ 5◦, |l| ≤ 2◦, 2◦ < |l| ≤ 5◦ and |l| > 5◦, respectively. The red
lines indicates the best linear ﬁt with recursive 3σ clipping where blue and green points are
data remained and rejected, respectively. The green lines indicate the best ﬁt for |l| ≤ 5◦ as
a comparison. They are all consistent each other.

– 26 –

Fig. 7.—: False color maps of the measured optical depth, τ200 (top panel) and the event
rate per star per year, Γ (bottom panel).

– 27 –

Fig. 8.—: The measured optical depth for the all-source (black ﬁlled circle) and RCG (red
large open circle) samples as a function of galactic latitude b for |l| < 5◦. The subﬁelds are
combined into bins of width ∆b = 0.5◦. The binned values are listed in Table 2 and 3. The
ﬁlled circles, triangles and squares indicate τ for all-source samples measured by MOA-II
(this work), MOA-I and MACHO surveys, respectively. The red circles, open squares, circles
and triangles denote the τ for RCG samples by the MOA-II (this work), MACHO, OGLE-II
and EROS surveys, respectively. The thick black and thin red solid lines indicate the best ﬁt
exponential functions for the MOA-II measurements. The red dashed line denote the best
linear model for the OGLE-II RCG sample as a comparison.

– 28 –

Fig. 9.—: The event rate per star per year, Γ, for the all-source (black ﬁlled circle) and RCG
(red open circle) samples as a function of the galactic latitude b for |l| < 5◦. The subﬁelds
are combined into bins of width ∆b = 0.5◦ for display purposes only, as the ﬁtting was done
using the unbinned subﬁeld data with the Poisson statistics ﬁtting method. The plotted
values are listed in Tables 2 and 3. The thick black and thin red solid lines indicate the best
ﬁt exponential functions for the all-source and RCG samples, respectively.

– 29 –

Fig. 10.—: The optical depth for events with tE < 200 days, τ200, for the all-source sample
as a function of the galactic latitude b for diﬀerent bins in Galactic longitude, l. The
curves show the best exponential ﬁt in b. The black curve is the ﬁt to all the events with
−2◦.25 < l < 3◦.75, and it provides a reasonable ﬁt to all the longitude bins, except the
0◦.75 < l < 2◦.25 bin, where there is an enhancement to the rate.

– 30 –

Fig. 11.—: The event rate per star per year, Γ, for the all-source sample as a function of
the galactic latitude b for diﬀerent bins in Galactic longitude, l. The curves show the best
exponential ﬁt in b to the unbinned subﬁeld data. The black curve is the ﬁt to all the events
with −2◦.25 < l < 3◦.75, and it provides a reasonable ﬁt to all the longitude bins, except
the 0◦.75 < l < 2◦.25 bin, where there is an enhancement to the rate.

– 31 –

Fig. 12.—: A 16-parameter model of microlensing event rate per star for the all-source
sample. The model is described by Equation (6) with parameters given in Table 5.

It is
better agreement than the original τ measurements by Sumi et al. (2013), while they are
still slightly higher.
