Abstract

Small-amplitude waves in the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam (FPU) lattice with weakly anharmonic
interaction potentials are described by the generalized Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation.
Justiﬁcation of the small-amplitude approximation is usually performed on the time scale, for
which dynamics of the KdV equation is deﬁned. We show how to extend justiﬁcation analysis
on longer time intervals provided dynamics of the generalized KdV equation is globally well-
posed in Sobolev spaces and either the Sobolev norms are globally bounded or they grow at
most polynomially. The time intervals are extended respectively by the logarithmic or double
logarithmic factors in terms of the small amplitude parameter. Controlling the approximation
error on longer time intervals allows us to deduce nonlinear metastability of small FPU solitary
waves from orbital stability of the KdV solitary waves.

Introduction

In this work, we address an open question from [5] on how to deduce nonlinear metastability or
instability of small Fermi–Pasta–Ulam (FPU) solitary waves from orbital stability or instability
of the Korteweg–de Vries (KdV) solitary waves. Let us consider dynamics of the FPU lattice
given by Newton’s equations of motion:

¨xn = V ′(xn+1 − xn) − V ′(xn − xn−1), n ∈ Z,

(1.1)

where (xn)n∈Z is a function of the time t ∈ R, with values in RZ, the dot denotes the time
derivative, and the interaction potential V is smooth. The coordinate xn corresponds to the
displacement of the n-th particle in a one-dimensional chain from its equilibrium position. The
potential V for anharmonic interactions of particles is taken in the form

V (u) =

u2 +

1
2

ǫ2

p + 1

up+1,

(1.2)

where p > 2 is integer and the strength of anharmonicity ǫ can be introduced by the scaling
transformation. The FPU lattice equations (1.1) can be rewritten in the strain variables un :=
xn+1 − xn as follows

¨un = V ′(un+1) − 2V ′(un) + V ′(un−1), n ∈ Z.

(1.3)

Using the well-known asymptotic multi-scale expansion [1, 6, 20],

un(t) = W (ǫ(n − t), ǫ3t) + error terms,

yields the generalized KdV equation for the leading-order approximation W given by

2Wτ +

12

Wξξξ + (W p)ξ = 0,

ξ ∈ R,

(1.4)

(1.5)

where τ = ǫ3t and ξ = ǫ(n − t).

Local well-posedness of the generalized KdV equation (1.5) in Sobolev spaces H s(R) is known

from the works of Kato [10, 11] for s > 3

2 and Kenig–Ponce–Vega [12, 13] for s > sp, where

.

For any local solution W ∈ C([−τ0, τ0], H s(R)) of the KdV equation (1.5) with s > 6 and τ0 > 0,
the error terms in the asymptotic multi-scale expansion (1.4) can be controlled as follows. There
exist positive constants ǫ0 and C0 such that, for all ǫ ∈ (0, ǫ0), when initial data (uin, ˙uin) ∈ ℓ2(R)
satisfy

kuin − W (ǫ·, 0)kℓ2 + k ˙uin + ǫ∂ξW (ǫ·, 0)kℓ2 6 ǫ3/2,

(1.6)

the unique solution (u, ˙u) to the FPU equation (1.3) with initial data (uin, ˙uin) belongs to
C 1([−τ0ǫ−3, τ0ǫ−3], ℓ2(Z)) and satisﬁes

ku(t) − W (ǫ(· − t), ǫ3t)kℓ2 + k ˙u(t) + ǫ∂ξW (ǫ(· − t), ǫ3t)kℓ2 6 C0ǫ3/2,

t ∈(cid:2)−τ0ǫ−3, τ0ǫ−3(cid:3) . (1.7)

The proof of this result is based on the energy estimates and Gronwall’s inequality [1, 6, 20].

Bound (1.7) suggests that small-amplitude FPU solitary waves are metastable or unstable if
the KdV solitary waves are orbitally stable or unstable. Indeed, the generalized KdV equation
(1.5) is known to have orbitally stable solitary waves for p = 2, 3, 4 and orbitally unstable solitary
waves for p > 5 [17]. However, this simple and widely accepted analogy appears in apparent
contradiction with the energy arguments found in [5] suggesting unconditional metastability of
small-amplitude FPU solitary waves on the time scale of O(ǫ−3).

The metastability result from [5] can be formulated as follows. Let us denote the traveling-
wave solutions of the FPU equation (1.3) by utrav. Then, for every τ0 > 0, there exist positive
constants ǫ0, δ0 and C0 such that, for all ǫ ∈ (0, ǫ0), when initial data (uin, ˙uin) ∈ ℓ2(R) satisfy

δ := kuin − utrav(0)kℓ2 + k ˙uin − ˙utrav(0)kℓ2 6 δ0,

(1.8)

the unique solution (u, ˙u) to the FPU equation (1.3) with initial data (uin, ˙uin) belongs to
C 1([−τ0ǫ−3, τ0ǫ−3], ℓ2(Z)) and satisﬁes

ku(t) − utrav(t)kl2 + k ˙u(t) − ˙utrav(t)kl2 6 C0δ,

(1.9)

t ∈(cid:2)−τ0ǫ−3, τ0ǫ−3(cid:3) .

Similarly to the bound (1.7), the bound (1.9) is also proved with the energy estimates and Gron-
wall’s inequality complemented with the asymptotic scaling of small-amplitude FPU traveling
waves utrav near the KdV solitary waves [5]. Nevertheless, the initial data (uin, ˙uin) can be
modulated on any spatial scale.

Bound (1.9) suggests unconditional metastability of small-amplitude FPU solitary waves up
to the time scale of O(ǫ−3) for every p > 2. This may be viewed as a contradiction with the
bound (1.7) that suggests instability of small-amplitude FPU solitary waves at the time scale of
O(ǫ−3) for p > 5 because the corresponding KdV solitary waves are unstable for p > 5 [17].

Of course, no contradiction arises because the energy methods used in the proof of the upper
bounds on the approximation errors (1.7) and (1.9) yield constants C0 that grow exponentially
in time τ0, that is, on the time scale of O(ǫ−3). As a result, the exponential divergence of the
constant C0 cannot be distinguished from the exponential instability of the KdV solitary waves
in the case p > 5. However, this observation also shows that the bound (1.9) is not a reliable
evidence to conclude on metastability of the small-amplitude FPU solitary waves in the case of
p = 2, 3, 4.

Nonlinear stability of small-amplitude FPU solitary waves in the case of the classical KdV
equation with p = 2 was studied in the series of papers by Friesecke & Pego [6] based on the
orbital and asymptotic stability of the KdV solitons [18]. Similarly, asymptotic stability of several
solitary waves was studied by Mizumachi [15, 16] and Benes, Hoﬀmann & Wayne [2, 9] also in
the case p = 2. Derivation and analysis of small-amplitude FPU solitary waves were recently
generalized for polyatomic FPU lattices in [7].

In the present work, we extend the bound (1.7) on the approximation error to longer time in-
tervals provided dynamics of the generalized KdV equation (1.5) is globally well-posed in Sobolev
spaces and either the Sobolev norms are globally bounded or they grow at most polynomially.

For the integrable cases p = 2 and p = 3, a uniform bound on the H s(R) norms for any s ∈ N
can be obtained from conserved quantities of the KdV and modiﬁed KdV hierarchies [4, 8]. For
the non-integrable case p = 4, the global solution is controlled in H 1(R) by using the energy
conservation, while the H s(R) norms with s > 2 can grow at most polynomially. In particular, it
was proved by Staﬃlani [21] that for any s > 2, there exists a constant Cs such that the unique
solution of the generalized KdV equation (1.5) with p = 4 satisﬁes

kW (τ )kH s 6 Cs|τ |s−1

as

|τ | → ∞.

(1.10)

Global solutions to the generalized KdV equation (1.5) with p > 5 exist and scatter to zero [13]
if the H sp(R) norm of initial data is small, where

sp =

p − 5

2(p − 1)

,

p > 5.

(1.11)

For the global solutions scattering to zero in the case p > 5, the H 1(R) norm is again controlled
by the energy conservation [13], and the polynomial bound (1.10) holds [21].

The following theorems extend the bound (1.7) on the approximation error to longer time
intervals. The two cases have to be considered separately, depending whether the H s(R) norm
of the KdV solution is globally bounded or may grow at most polynomially.

Theorem 1. Let W ∈ C(R, H s(R)) be a global solution to the generalized KdV equation (1.5)

with either p = 2 or p = 3 for some integer s > 6. For ﬁxed r ∈ (cid:0)0, 1

constants ǫ0, C, and K such that, for all ǫ ∈ (0, ǫ0), when initial data (uin, ˙uin) ∈ ℓ2(R) satisfy

2(cid:1), there exist positive

kuin − W (ǫ·, 0)kℓ2 + k ˙uin + ǫ∂ξW (ǫ·, 0)kℓ2 6 ǫ3/2,

(1.12)

the unique solution (u, ˙u) to the FPU equation (1.3) with initial data (uin, ˙uin) belongs to

C 1([−t0(ǫ), t0(ǫ)], ℓ2(Z))

3

with t0(ǫ) := rK −1ǫ−3| log(ǫ)| and satisﬁes

ku(t) − W (ǫ(· − t), ǫ3t)kℓ2 + k ˙u(t) + ǫ∂ξW (ǫ(· − t), ǫ3t)kℓ2 6 Cǫ3/2−r,

t ∈ [−t0(ǫ), t0(ǫ)] . (1.13)

Theorem 2. Let W ∈ C(R, H s(R)) be a global solution to the generalized KdV equation (1.5)
with either p = 4 or p > 5 and small kW (0)kH sp , for some integer s > 6. For ﬁxed r ∈

(cid:0)0, 1
2(cid:1), there exist positive constants ǫ0, C, and K such that, for all ǫ ∈ (0, ǫ0), when initial data

(uin, ˙uin) ∈ ℓ2(R) satisfy

kuin − W (ǫ·, 0)kℓ2 + k ˙uin + ǫ∂ξW (ǫ·, 0)kℓ2 6 ǫ3/2,

(1.14)

the unique solution (u, ˙u) to the FPU equation (1.3) with initial data (uin, ˙uin) belongs to

with t0(ǫ) := (2pK)−1ǫ−3 log (r| log(ǫ)|) and satisﬁes

C 1([−t0(ǫ), t0(ǫ)], ℓ2(Z))

ku(t) − W (ǫ(· − t), ǫ3t)kℓ2 + k ˙u(t) + ǫ∂ξW (ǫ(· − t), ǫ3t)kℓ2 6 Cǫ3/2−r,

t ∈ [−t0(ǫ), t0(ǫ)] . (1.15)

We note that the ﬁnal time of the dynamics of the generalized KdV equation (1.5) given
by τ0(ǫ) := ǫ3t0(ǫ) depends on ǫ and satisﬁes τ0(ǫ) → ∞ as ǫ → 0 both in Theorems 1 and 2.
Bounds (1.13) and (1.15) allow us to deduce nonlinear metastability of small FPU solitary waves
in the solution (u, ˙u) from orbital stability of the KdV solitary waves in the solution W to the
generalized KdV equation (1.5). In particular, solitary waves of the generalized KdV equation
(1.5) are orbitally stable for p = 2, 3, 4, and so are small-amplitude FPU solitary waves on long
but ﬁnite time intervals.

Solitary waves of the generalized KdV equation (1.5) are unstable for p > 5 and the class of
global solutions considered in Theorem 2 for p > 5 excludes solitary waves. On the other hand,
dynamics of the small-amplitude waves in the FPU lattice resembles scattering dynamics of small
solutions to the generalized KdV equation (1.5) with p > 5 [13].

Extended approximations on longer time intervals become increasingly popular in the jus-
tiﬁcation analysis of amplitude equations in various evolutionary problems. One of the pioneer
works is developed by Lannes & Rauch in the context of validity of the nonlinear geometric optics
equations [14]. Extended time intervals modiﬁed by a logarithmic factor of ǫ were introduced in
the justiﬁcation of the discrete nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation in the context of the FPU lattices
[3] and the Klein–Gordon lattices [19]. Our work addresses the extended time intervals in the
justiﬁcation of the KdV equation in the context of the FPU lattices.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 represents the basic set up for
justiﬁcation analysis of the generalized KdV equation (1.5) from the FPU lattice equation (1.3).
Justiﬁcation arguments on the KdV time scale are well-known and follow the formalism described
in [20] with a reﬁnement given in [5]. Sections 3 and 4 present details of the proofs of Theorems
1 and 2. This part is original and represents the main result of this paper.

2 Justiﬁcation setup

The scalar second-order equation (1.3) can be rewritten as the following ﬁrst-order evolution
system

(cid:26) ˙un = qn+1 − qn,

˙qn = un − un−1 + ǫ2(up

n − up

n−1),

n ∈ Z.

(2.1)

Local solutions (u, q) ∈ C 1([−t0, t0], ℓ2(Z)) exists by standard Picard iterations, thanks to analyt-
icity of the power nonlinearity with p ∈ N and to the boundness of the shift operators on ℓ2(Z).
For a given initial data (uin, qin) ∈ ℓ2(Z), local solutions are extended to the global solutions
(u, q) ∈ C 1(R, ℓ2(Z)) by decreasing the values of ǫ thanks to the energy conservation

(2.2)

If p is odd, no constraints on ǫ arise for existence of global solutions (u, q) ∈ C 1(R, ℓ2(Z)) to the
FPU lattice equations (2.1).

Let us use the decomposition

un(t) = W (ǫ(n − t), ǫ3t) + Un(t),

qn(t) = Pǫ(ǫ(n − t), ǫ3t) + Qn(t), n ∈ Z,

(2.3)

where W (ξ, τ ) is a suitable solution to the generalized KdV equation (1.5) (and thus W is ǫ-
independent), whereas the ǫ-dependent function Pǫ(ξ, τ ) is found from the truncation of the ﬁrst
equation of the system (2.1) rewritten as

Pǫ(ξ + ǫ, τ ) − Pǫ(ξ, τ ) = −ǫ∂ξW (ξ, τ ) + ǫ3∂τ W (ξ, τ ).

(2.4)

Looking for an approximate solution Pǫ to this equation up to and including the formal order of
O(ǫ3), we write

Pǫ := P (0) + ǫP (1) + ǫ2P (2) + ǫ3P (3)

(2.5)

and collect the corresponding powers of ǫ. After routine computations (see, e.g., [5]), we obtain

(2.6)

Note that equation (2.4) is satisﬁed by the expansion (2.6) only approximately, up to the terms
of the formal order O(ǫ5).

Functions W and Pǫ depend on ξ = ǫ(n − t).

In order to be able to control the residual
terms of the KdV approximation, we will use the following lemma proved in [5] (see also [20] for
a weaker result).

Lemma 2.1. There exists C > 0 such that for all X ∈ H 1(R) and ǫ ∈ (0, 1),

The following result provide bounds on the residual and nonlinear terms, provided that the

(1.5).

By formal expansion of Res(2)(t) in ǫ, we conﬁrm that all terms up to and including the formal
order ǫ4 are canceled if W satisﬁes the generalized KdV equation (1.5). On the other hand, the
remainder terms contains terms like (2.11) and additionally terms like

By using estimates (2.9) and (2.10) in Lemma 2.2, the generalized KdV equation (1.5) for W ,
and the coercivity bound (2.15), we ﬁnally obtain the estimate (2.16).

3 Proof of Theorem 1

Here we use the formalism of Section 2 and prove Theorem 1.

We consider global solutions to the KdV and modiﬁed KdV equations (p = 2, 3). In this case,
it is known [4] that for any global solution W ∈ C(R, H s(R)) with s > 6, there exists a positive
constant δ that only depends on the initial value of W at τ = 0 such that

kW (·, τ )kH s 6 δ

for every τ ∈ R.

(3.1)

In what follows, we neglect mentioning that all constants depend on the choice of s > 6.

For any initial data (uin, ˙uin) ∈ ℓ2(R) satisfying the bound (1.12), there exists a local solution
(u, ˙u) ∈ C 1((−t0, t0), ℓ2(Z)) to the FPU equation (1.3). Equivalently, there exists a local solution
(u, q) ∈ C 1((−t0, t0), ℓ2(Z)) to the FPU lattice equations (2.1). The solution can be decomposed
according to equation (2.3).

Let us set S := E 1/2, where E(t) is the energy-type quantity deﬁned by (2.13). The initial
bound (1.12) ensures that S(0) 6 C0ǫ3/2 for some constant C0 > 0, if ǫ0 is chosen by (2.14).

For ﬁxed ǫ-independent constants r ∈ (cid:0)0, 1

continuation time

t ∈ [−T0, T0]o .

Let us also deﬁne the maximal evolution time of the generalized KdV equation (1.5) by τ0(ǫ) =
rK −1| log(ǫ)|. The energy estimate (2.16) of Lemma 2.3 can be rewritten for the variable S by

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(3.3)

where C1 and C2 are positive constants that are independent of δ and ǫ. Since δ is independent of
the maximal existence time τ0(ǫ) and hence is independent of ǫ, we can choose an ǫ-independent
positive constant K suﬃciently large such that

C2h(δp−1 + δ2p−2) + ǫ−1(δp−2 + C p−2ǫ(3/2−r)(p−2))Cǫ3/2−ri 6 K,

By Gronwall’s inequality, we obtain

S(t) 6(cid:16)S(0) + K −1C1(δ + δ2p−1)ǫ3/2(cid:17) eKτ0(ǫ),

t ∈ [−TC,K,r, TC,K,r],

(3.6)

where the exponent is extended to the maximal existence time t0(ǫ) := ǫ−3τ0(ǫ). From the
deﬁnition of τ0(ǫ), we have

τ0(ǫ) = rK −1| log(ǫ)| ⇒ eKτ0(ǫ) = ǫ−r.

Thus, we get from (3.6),

S(t) 6(cid:0)C0 + K −1C1(δ + δ2p−1)(cid:1) ǫ3/2−r,

One can choose an ǫ-independent constant C > C0 suﬃciently large such that

t ∈ [−TC,K,r, TC,K,r].

C0 + K −1C1(δ + δ2p−1) 6 C.

(3.8)

Under the constraints (3.4) and (3.8) on C > C0 and K > 0, the time interval in (3.2) can be
extended to the maximal interval with TC,K,r = t0(ǫ) = ǫ−3τ0(ǫ). Bound (1.13) of Theorem 1 is
proved due to the estimate (3.7) and the coercivity bound (2.15), while the deﬁnition of C may
need a minor adjustment.

4 Proof of Theorem 2

Here we use the formalism of Section 2 and prove Theorem 2.

We consider global solutions to the generalized KdV equations with p > 4. It follows from
[21] that for any global solution W ∈ C(R, H s(R)) with s > 6, there exists positive constants A
and K such that

δ(τ ) := sup

kW (·, τ ′)kH s 6 A(1 + |τ |s−1) 6 AeK|τ |

for every τ ∈ R.

(4.1)

τ ′∈[−τ,τ ]

Again, we neglect mentioning that all constants depend on the choice of s > 6. We note that the
global solution to the generalized KdV equation (1.5) with p > 5 exists if the H sp(R) norm of
the initial value W at τ = 0 is small, where sp is given by (1.11) [13].

For any initial data (uin, ˙uin) ∈ ℓ2(R) satisfying the bound (1.14), there exists a local solution
(u, ˙u) ∈ C 1((−t0, t0), ℓ2(Z)) to the FPU equation (1.3), or equivalently, a local solution (u, q) ∈
C 1((−t0, t0), ℓ2(Z)) to the FPU lattice equations (2.1). The solution can be decomposed according
to equation (2.3).

Let us set S := E 1/2, where E(t) is the energy-type quantity deﬁned by (2.13). The initial
bound (1.12) ensures that S(0) 6 C0ǫ3/2 for some constant C0 > 0, if ǫ0 is chosen by (2.14). For

bound (4.1), let us deﬁne the maximal continuation time

ﬁxed ǫ-independent constants r ∈ (cid:0)0, 1
TC,K,r := supnT0 ∈(cid:0)0, (2pK)−1ǫ−3 log (r| log(ǫ)|)(cid:3) :

2(cid:1), C > C0, and K > 0, where K is the same as in the

S(t) 6 Cǫ3/2−r,

t ∈ [−T0, T0]o .

(4.2)

Note that the maximal evolution time of the generalized KdV equation (1.5) by

τ0(ǫ) = (2pK)−1 log (r| log(ǫ)|)

9

is chosen diﬀerently compared to the proof of Theorem 1. The energy estimate (2.16) of Lemma
2.3 is rewritten for S by

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

dS

dt(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

6 C1(δ(τ ) + δ2p−1(τ ))ǫ9/2 + ǫ3C2(cid:2)(δp−1(τ ) + δ2p−2(τ )) + ǫ−1(δp−2(τ ) + S p−2)S(cid:3) S, (4.3)

where C1 and C2 are positive constants that are independent of δ and ǫ. Since δ depends on
time τ according to the bound (4.1), we may choose the ǫ-independent positive constant K in
the bound (4.1) suﬃciently large such that

C2h(δp−1(τ ) + δ2p−2(τ )) + ǫ−1(δp−2(τ ) + C p−2ǫ(3/2−r)(p−2))Cǫ3/2−ri 6 2pKe2pK|τ |,

as long as S(t) 6 Cǫ3/2−r, since r ∈(cid:0)0, 1
2(cid:1). Using (4.3) and (4.4), we obtain

where B > 0 is another ǫ-independent constant and the inequality (4.5) is set for t > 0 for
simplicity. The estimate for t < 0 are similar. By Gronwall’s inequality, we obtain

(4.4)

(4.5)

S(t) 6(cid:16)e−1S(0) + BFK)ǫ3/2(cid:17) ee2pKτ0 (ǫ)

,

t ∈ [−TC,K,r, TC,K,r],

(4.6)

where the exponent is extended to the maximal existence time t0(ǫ) := ǫ−3τ0(ǫ) and the positive
ǫ-independent constant FK is deﬁned by

FK :=Z ∞

0

e(2p−1)Kτ e−e2pKτ

dτ < ∞.

From the deﬁnition of τ0(ǫ), we have

τ0(ǫ) = (2pK)−1 log (r| log(ǫ)|) ⇒ ee2pKτ0(ǫ)

= ǫ−r.

Thus, we get from (4.6),

S(t) 6 (C0 + BFK ) ǫ3/2−r,

t ∈ [−TC,K,r, TC,K,r].

(4.7)

Note that FK → 0 as K → ∞. One can choose an ǫ-independent constant C > C0 suﬃciently
large such that

C0 + BFK 6 C.

(4.8)

Under the constraints (4.1), (4.4) and (4.8) on C > C0 and K > 0, we can extend the time interval
in (4.2) to the maximal interval with TC,K,r = t0(ǫ) = ǫ−3τ0(ǫ). Bound (1.15) of Theorem 2 is
proved due to the estimate (4.7) and the coercivity bound (2.15), while the deﬁnition of C may
need a minor adjustment.
