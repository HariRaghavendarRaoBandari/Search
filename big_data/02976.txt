Introduction

We recently became interested in a paper by H. Qin et al. [1] that describes a sym-
plectic particle-in-cell (PIC) tracking algorithm. Our purpose is to try to make use
of this algorithm to study space charge eﬀects in our 500 MeV cyclotron.

H. Qin et al. derived from the Hamiltonian of the Vlasov-Maxwell system, with
time as independent variable, a set of equations of motion that describe the evolution
of a “discretized” plasma; discretized in both real space (PIC mesh) and phase space
(macro particles). They propose to solve numerically these equations of motion us-
ing a standard symplectic integrator. Their algorithm is radically diﬀerent from the
usual PIC tracking algorithms for particle accelerators. In a usual PIC codes, the
electromagnetic potential/ﬁeld is recalculated ‘from scratch’ (from the distribution
of macro particles, solving Poisson’s equation) at every step; whereas in their algo-
rithm the evolution of both the potential/ﬁeld and the macro particles phase space
coordinates are pushed self-consistently over each time step with the same symplectic
integrator.

To adapt the proposed algorithm to the case of beam tracking in our cyclotron,

we must overcome a few ‘obstacles’:

1. The Hamiltonian they start from is not truly relativistic, hence the (p−A)2
kinetic energy term (mass and charge terms are omitted); this may not be a big
issue, especially if we want to simulate space charge eﬀects in the low energy
section of our cyclotron. But we will show in this note that it is not harder to
work with a truly relativistic Hamiltonian.

2

2. The Hamiltonian they start from is not entirely expressed in terms of canoni-
cally conjugated variables; for this reason they use a modiﬁed Poisson bracket.
We will show in this note that it is possible to use only canonically conjugated
variables.

3. The Hamiltonian they start from is expressed in ﬁxed ‘Lab’ frame with time
as the independent variable; accelerator optics codes are usually written in a
Frenet-Serret-like moving coordinate system with a space coordinate (s or θ)
as the independent variable.

4. To move back and forth between the discrete real space (PIC mesh) and phase
space (macro particles) H. Qin et al. use interpolation; it remains to be proven

2

that this does not spoil the symplectic nature of their algorithm.

5. They make use of the temporal gauge (also called Weyl gauge, scalar electric
potential Φ = 0), which might not be the most practical choice in our case,
where boundary conditions are easier to expressed using the scalar electric
potential.

In this note we start from the Lagrangian of the Maxwell-Vlasov system proposed
by F.E. Low [2]. We modify the ‘kinetic-energy’ term of the Lagrangian density to
be consistent with special relativity. We use Hamilton’s principle of least action
to derive a ﬁrst set of equations of motion from this Lagrangian, and we verify
that these equations of motion are consistent with Lorentz’ equation and Maxwell’s
equations. We then apply the generalized Legendre’s transformation to obtain from
this Lagrangian the Hamiltonian of our system expressed in term of canonically
conjugated variables/momentum densities. At this point we will have overcome the
two ﬁrst ‘obstacles’ listed above. The last three still remain... work in progress...

2 Lagrangian

2.1

Ingredients of the Lagrangian

Φ and A are the electric scalar and magnetic vector potential. They are related to
the electric and magnetic ﬁelds through:

E = − ∇Φ −

B =∇ × A.

∂A
∂t

;

(1)

x is the position of a ﬂuid particle; it is function of the particle initial position x0
and initial velocity v0 and time t; q and m are the charge and mass of the elementary
particles constituting our beam. r is the “static” space coordinate vector (i.e. it does
not move with the ﬂuid particles). f (x, v, t) : R7 7−→ R is our plasma/beam density
function. f0 = f (x0, v0) is the initial plasma density function. ϕ0(r) : R3 7−→ R is a
“test function”, equal to one inside a bounded volume V and equal to zero outside.

2.2 Relativistic Space-Charge Lagrangian

Based on the Lagrangian proposed by F.E. Low [2], and using notation introduced
by Cendra et al. [3], we write for a given initial continuum of ﬂuid particles (i.e. a

3

given f0) and a given volume of concern V (i.e. a given ϕ0) the following Lagrangian:

Lf0,ϕ0(x, ˙x, Φ, ˙Φ, A, ˙A; t) =

(2)

Dots stand for partial derivatives w.r.t. time (see section 2.3). The ﬁrst integral is a
sum over the (continuous) set of ﬂuid particles; the second integral is a usual volume
integral:

Lf0,ϕ0(x, ˙x, Φ, ˙Φ, A, ˙A; t) =ZZ Lf0(x, ˙x, Φ, A) dx0 dv0 +Z Lϕ0(Φ, A, ˙A) dr.

2.3 About Partial Time Derivatives

In the ﬁrst part of this Lagrangian partial time derivatives are taken holding (x0, v0)
ﬁxed, i.e. holding on a given macro particle; in the second part of this Lagrangian

the partial time derivatives are taken holding the space coordinate r ﬁxed. Relation
between these two types of partial derivatives are obtained from chain rule:

Ostrogradsky’s theorem we get:

Eq. 18 makes us understand better the physical meaning of the “test function” ϕ0:
it deﬁnes the boundary of our system, outside which ρ(r, t) = 0.

• we integrate by parts (∇×δA)·(∇×A) = ∇·(δA×(∇×A))+δA·∇×(∇×A),

and drop the boundary term;

• we apply again the least action principle;

q ˙xf0 dx0dv0). Eq. 22 states that no current ﬂows outside of V.

3 From Lagrangian to Hamiltonian

Since this is a continuous system, we need to work in a classical continuum mechanics
context. The Lagrangian density function, L is deﬁned by:

and the Hamiltonian density, H, is similarly deﬁned:

L =Z Ldx ,

And the associated Legendre transformation is given by:

H =Z Hdx .

H =Xi

where dots stand for partial derivatives w.r.t. time. The conjugate momenta densi-
ties are deﬁned by:

ˆPi =

∂L
∂ ˙q

.

(26)

However, in our case the Lagrangian derives from two separate Lagrangian densities:

Lf0,ϕ0 =ZZ Lf0(x, ˙x, Φ, A) dx0 dv0 +Z Lϕ0(Φ, A, ˙A) dr.

Note the variable dependencies of the Lagrangian: dotted terms that appear
explicitly in one Lagrangian density do not appear explicitly in the other
one. This will allow us to take the Legendre transform of each Lagrangian density
independently and combine the resulting Hamiltonians.

After substitution into the Hamiltonian:

3.2 Second Hamiltonian Density

The momenta densities for this term are:

ˆPΦ = 0
ˆPA = −ϕ0ǫ0E

The Legendre transformation gives:

Hϕ0 = ˆPx · ˙x + ˆPA · ˙A + ˆPΦ · ˙Φ − Lϕ0

At this point we will need to choose a gauge (the lack of equation of motion providing
˙Φ makes us understand why Hong Qin et al. chose the temporal gauge). After that
we will need to plug these equations of motion into a symplectic integrator and try
them out on a simple test case.

5 Appendix

5.1 Functional Derivative

Let L(f ) be a mapping from a space of functions M = {f (x) : x ∈ Rn} to a ﬁeld of
real number (L : M 7−→ R). Such a mapping is called a functional. Let now vary f
by adding to it a function δf . The resulting variation of L is:

If after expanding δL in powers of δf , δL can be written as:

δL = L(f + δf ) − L(f )

δL =Z D(x)δf (x) + O(δf (x)2) dx

(48)

(49)

D(x) is called the functional derivative of L w.r.t. f evaluated at x and is written

δL

δf (x)

.

11

In the “1D” case where f (x) : x ∈ R, the previous deﬁnition is also equivalent to:

δL

δf (x0)

= lim
ǫ→0

L(f + ǫδ(x − x0)) − L(f )

ǫ

,

(50)

where δ(x − x0) is the Dirac δ function. See for instance Ref. [4].

5.2 Vector Function Variation

In the process of ﬁnding the variation of the Lagrangian we applied the rule of
integration by parts to volume integrals.
In the derivation of the Euler Lagrange
equation the basis of variational calculus (outlined here: Wikipedia Euler-Lagrange)
the variation of the function f denoted δf is deﬁned such that:

δf (x0, t0) = δf (x1, t1) = 0

(51)

Where t0 and t1 are the initial and ﬁnal times and x0 and x1 are the ﬁxed initial and
ﬁnal positions respectively. This is necessary so that the end points of f +δf are ﬁxed.

The vector case follows straightforwardly. We deﬁne the variation ~δf such that

~δf |∂V (t0) = ~δf |∂V (t1) = 0

(52)

So that the vector function solution ~f + ~δf has a ﬁxed boundary. It follows for an
arbitrary vector function ~A the closed surface integral on the boundary is;

δf ~(A) · ~dS = 0

I∂V

(53)

Since ~δf = 0 on ∂V
