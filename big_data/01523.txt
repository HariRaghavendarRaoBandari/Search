Abstract

This report presents a meta analysis of various sources from literature,
research projects, and experience with the goal of collecting examples for
instance-spanning constraints to be implemented through Process-Aware
Information Systems.

Keywords: Process-Aware Information Systems, Instance-spanning Constraints,
Requirements, Meta analysis

Introduction

1
The goal of CRISP is the acquisition, formalization, implementation, moni-
toring, enforcement, and adaptation of instance-spanning constraints (ISC) in
process-aware information systems (PAIS). ISC are a crucial building block for
process-oriented applications, but have not been comprehensively investigated
yet. An example requirement for ISC is the realization of bundling or unbundling
of cargo over several logistic processes.

In this report, ISC examples are collected based on a meta analysis of var-
ious sources. These sources include literature as well as various projects from
diﬀerent application areas. The ISC example collection provides the basis for
a subsequent requirements analysis on ISC deﬁnition and implementation in
PAIS.

The report is structured as follows: In Section 2, the methodology employed
for ISC collection is outlined. Section 3 presents the results of ISC collection.
Section 4 provides a summary and outlook.

2 Collecting ISC examples: Methodology
This section describes how sources and application areas were identiﬁed and
contributed to this report.

2.1 Related Work Analysis
We started from looking at the “core” related work which focuses on research in
the area of instance-spanning, inter-instance, or cross-instance constraints, i.e.,
[7, 12, 19, 24, 17, 10, 11]. These approaches yield the starting point for further
analysis in two ways, i.e., provide ﬁrst examples and help to identify relevant
application areas (see next step).

2.2 Application Areas Identiﬁcation
The identiﬁcation of application areas was complemented by experiences from
selected projects, i.e., the EU FP7 project ADVENTURE1 and the FFG project
PROMISE2. Related application areas were identiﬁed based on core literature
(cf. Section 2.1) and the availability of information. The goal was to identify
at least four diﬀerent areas in order to obtain a suﬃciently broad experience
base. In the end, ﬁve areas were identiﬁed, i.e., health care (e.g., [7, 19, 10]),
security (e.g., [24]), transport / logistics (e.g., [17]), manufacturing (e.g., [11]),
and energy (cf. PROMISE project).

2.3 Document Collection for Application Areas
For this step sources of real-world examples from diﬀerent application areas
had to be identiﬁed. Searching documents of application-oriented projects fo-
cusing on a speciﬁc area such as funded by the European Union (EU)3 seemed
a feasible source, in particular, as all of the ﬁve identiﬁed areas health care,
security, transport / logistics, manufacturing, and energy constitute pillars of
the EU programme. Another source is the FFG4 as Austrian funding schema
for application-oriented research. In order to be comprehensive the FWF5 as
the Austrian funding scheme for basic research as well as the WWTF6 as fund-
ing body for basic research projects with application prospects in Vienna were
scanned for related projects as well.

1. Identify relevant EU projects: Relevant EU projects were identiﬁed based
on the following methodology. At ﬁrst, FP7 and H2020 project databases7
were searched starting with COOPERATION projects. This selection of projects

was reﬁned based on the ﬁve application areas, i.e., HEALTH, SECURITY,
TRANSPORT, INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING, and ENERGY. Note that INT-
ELLIGENT MANUFACTURING was not directly located under COOPERATION,
but under Other R&D Programmes. It was crucial to select ICT projects
as cross-cutting concern in order to retrieve relevant results for PAIS. The
search was also conducted in the opposite direction, i.e., starting with ICT
projects and then selecting the ﬁve application areas. From these projects
at the interface of ICT and the ﬁve application areas, were selected the
ones that seemed to have a focus on processes by looking through the
short project description.

2. Identify relevant FFG projects: The focus was put on the ICT of the future
(IKT der Zukunft) programme8 as it reﬂects cooperative projects between
research institutions and industry. Moreover, pillars of the programme
relate to the identiﬁed application areas. Speciﬁcally, the database for
Factories of the Future projects9 was regarded a promising source.

3. Identify relevant FWF projects using the FWF project database10.

4. Identify relevant WWTF projects using the WWTF project database11

2.4 Analysis of industrial and experience papers from con-

ferences in the business process domain

Often conferences feature some industry or experience track where case stud-
ies are presented. We regard this as valuable source for ISC examples. The
conference selection is based on the process-orientation, i.e., business process
management should be one of the relevant topics of the conference. The inter-
national conferences on Business Process Management (BPM), Advanced Infor-
mation Systems Engineering (CAISE), Service-Oriented Computing (ICSOC),
Business Informatis (CBI), and Enterprise Computing (EDOC) were chosen.

2.5 Additional ISC examples from experience
The motivation behind using ISC examples from our own experience, is that the
authors have worked in diﬀerent areas such as insurance, project management,
and higher education. These examples from areas diﬀerent from the ﬁve pri-
marily selected ones can be seen as valuable extension reﬂecting the wide-spread
use and importance of ISC.

Projects DECI, MyCyFAPP, NoHoW, EDEN were obviously just started in
H2020, hence no public deliverables are available yet. For projects, CAPER,
ABC4EU, IDIRA, PREMANUS, COMVANTAGE, LinkedDesign, FFD, ISES,
VISTRA and CONTAIN, no relevant documents containing use case descrip-
tions were available from the website. For STAR-TRANS and IMCOSEC the
website was not available while for PREEMPTIVE, EPES, E-Freight and VE-
NIS processes were available, but no explicit ISC were extractable. IMAGINE
oﬀered no deliverables in English. SECCRIT oﬀers data protection require-
ments on a too coarse level for identifying ISC examples. As a consequence,
it cannot be determined whether the requirement concerns instance-spanning
aspects. For FASTPASS, no ISC were extractable. Finally, EUROSKY and
COMPOSITE had a diﬀerent scope than originally expected.

One interesting observation is that security projects yielding ISC exam-
ples are often more speciﬁcally residing in the area of crisis management, e.g.,
BRIDGE and EMILI.

3.3 Results for searching FFG, FWF, and WWTF projects
For FFG projects, the project database for Factories of the Future (cf. Sec-
tion 2.3) was analyzed. Unfortunately, no ISC examples could be extracted. But
a link to the FWF project database was found and therefore it was decided to
scan through FWF projects as well. The search was done on ALL projects in area
102 Informatik for the years from 2010 – 2015 resulting in 427 projects. Se-
lecting those projects with a process focus resulted in 5 projects. These projects
either did not refer to constraints or had a diﬀerent focus.

The analysis also covered WWTF projects, where the focus was put on the
ICT calls from 2008. Two projects with a focus on processes were selected.
One project considered intra-instance constraints. The other project EDIMINE
addresses Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that are calculated over multiple
instances and for which their performance has to be monitored [9].

3.4 Results from searching regulatory documents
The idea was to complement the search with an analysis of regulatory doc-
uments that have been identiﬁed as interesting sources during project analy-
sis. One source for ISC examples from the energy / smart grid area discovered
through the PROMISE project and the “Austrian Use Cases for Smart Metering
Advanced Meter Communication System (ACMS)” (original in German: Öster-
reichs Use-Cases) [15]. The document bundles all use cases for introduction of
smart meters in Austria.

Another source for privacy regulations identiﬁed through the PARIS project28
are the regulations analyzed in, for example, [18], i.e., The EDPS Video-Survei-

Whereas the documents on privacy do not directly contain any ISC exam-
ples, the document on energy / smart grid processes includes several examples
(more speciﬁcally service level agreements) that can be expressed and monitored
by using ISC over the associated energy / smart grid processes. Tables 5 and
6 show ISC examples taken from [15]. Note that some of the ISCs have been
aggregated, i.e., for the same ISC referring to diﬀerent activities, one ISC con-
taining all diﬀerent activity options is considered. One example is ISC For 100

3.5 Results from searching papers from industry and ex-

perience conference sessions

The Int’l Conference on Business Process Management (BPM) was scanned for
industrial papers since 2000 resulting in 4 industrial papers describing in total 13
ISC examples (cf. Table 7). For the other conferences, only few industrial papers
were found or they did not have a speciﬁc process focus. Sometimes industrial
papers were more of tool descriptions than presenting real-world studies.

ISC examples from experience

Table 8 summarizes ISC examples collected from own working or project ex-
perience. Reﬂecting this diverse experience, the ISC examples also stem from
other areas than the originally selected ones. However, most of the examples
can be related to areas such as health care, security, manufacturing, transport
/ logistics, and energy / smart grids.

Figure 1: Distribution of ISC examples along areas and along sources

4 Conclusions and Outlook
In summary, 114 ISC examples were collected during this meta analysis. Figure
1(left) illustrates the distribution of ISC along the diﬀerent application areas.
It can be seen that all ﬁve originally selected areas seemingly demand for the
support of ISC. The energy domain seems to be the most eﬀective source for
ISC examples, followed by security, logistics / transport, health care and man-
ufacturing. If manufacturing is combined with automotive, the second highest
number of examples stem from this combined category. Overall, the result is
not really surprising as the search was tailored towards these ﬁve areas. An
interesting category is automotive as it was not explicitly selected and searched
for. The automotive domain seems to play an important role contributed by
industry papers (ind) and experience (exp).

On the right side of Figure 1, the distribution of ISC examples along the
analyzed sources is shown. The majority of ISC examples stem from regulatory
documents (reg), speciﬁcally from a single document. The low number of an-
alyzed regulatory documents (one for energy and ﬁve for security) is indeed a
limitation because there is an abundance of regulatory documents for all kinds of
areas in general. Hence, in future work, regulatory documents must be carefully
selected and analyzed in order to come up with more ISC examples.

We could think about grouping the ISC examples into one group literature
(lit and ind) and the rest that accounts for the application of ISC, i.e., all
projects, all regulatory documents, and all experiences. Then the distribution
is 24% examples from literature and 76% ISC examples from application. It
can be expected that the analysis of further regulatory documents might even
increase the percentage of ISC examples from application. This might indicate
that the demand from application towards the support of ISC is big. At the same
time it is to be investigated whether existing approaches reﬂected by literature
can respond to this demand. This is of course not decidable on basis of this
meta analysis as only examples were considered and no approaches, but at least

14

some recommendation to increase research on ISC can be made.
