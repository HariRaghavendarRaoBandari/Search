The passive states of a quantum system minimize the average energy among all the states with
a given spectrum. We prove that they are the optimal inputs of a large class of lossy quantum
channels, in the sense that the output generated by a passive state is still passive and majorizes
(i.e. it is less noisy than) the output generated by any other state with the same spectrum. This is
an extension of De Palma et al. [arXiv:1511.00293], where the same result is proved for one-mode
bosonic Gaussian channels. We also prove that for ﬁnite temperature this optimality property can
fail already in a two-level system, where the best input is a coherent superposition of the two energy
eigenstates.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The passive states [1, 2] of a quantum system are the
states diagonal in the eigenbasis of the Hamiltonian, with
eigenvalues decreasing as the energy increases. They
minimize the average energy among all the states with
a given spectrum, and hence no work can be extracted
from them on average with unitary operations [3]. For
this reason they play a key role in the recently emerging
ﬁeld of quantum thermodynamics (see [4, 5] for a review).
Majorization [6] is the order relation between quantum
states induced by random unitary operations, i.e. a state
ˆσ is majorized by a state ˆρ iﬀ ˆσ can be obtained applying
to ˆρ random unitaries. Majorization theory is ubiquitous
in quantum information. Its very deﬁnition suggests ap-
plications in quantum thermodynamics [5, 7, 8], where
the goal is determining the set of ﬁnal states that can be
obtained from a given initial state with a given set of op-
erations. In the context of quantum entanglement, it also
determines whether it is possible to convert a given bi-
partite pure state into another given pure state by means
of local operations and classical communication [9, 10].
More in the spirit of this paper, majorization has proven
to be crucial in the longstanding problem of the determi-
nation of the classical communication capacity of quan-
tum gauge-covariant bosonic Gaussian channels [11], and
the consequent proof of the optimality of Gaussian states
for the information encoding. Indeed, a turning point has
been the proof of a majorization property: the output of
any of these channels generated by any input state is ma-
jorized by the output generated by the vacuum [12, 13]
(see also [14] for a review). This fundamental result has
been extended and linked to the notion of passive states
in Ref. [15], where it is proved that these states optimize
the output of any one-mode quantum Gaussian channel,
in the sense that the output generated by a passive state
majorizes the output generated by any other state with
the same spectrum. Moreover, the same channels pre-
serve the majorization relation when applied to passive
states [16].

In this paper we extend the result of Ref.

[15] to a

large class of lossy channels, resulting from a weak inter-
action with a Markovian bath in its zero-temperature (i.e.
ground) state. We prove that these channels preserve the
set of passive states, that are their optimal inputs in the
sense that the output generated by a passive state ma-
jorizes the output generated by any other state with the
same spectrum. As its counterpart valid for quantum
Gaussian channels, our result can ﬁnd applications in
the proof of entropic inequalities on the output states of
lossy channels in the same spirit of the quantum Entropy
Power Inequalities of [17–19], and then determine their
classical capacity.

In deriving our result we assume few hypothesis on
the dynamical process which governs the lossy evolution.
Speciﬁcally we require the Hamiltonian of the system to
be non-degenerate, and impose the generator of the mas-
ter equation to induce quantum jumps of at most one
energy step, and the generated quantum channel to map
the maximally mixed state into a passive state. These as-
sumptions (together with the requirement of dealing with
zero temperature baths), while veriﬁed by a large class
of processes, turn out to be necessary. Indeed, dropping
any of them it is possible to ﬁnd explicit counterexam-
ples for which passive inputs are not optimal choices for
output majorization.

The manuscript is organized as follows. In Sec. II we
brieﬂy recall some basics facts about majorization and
the notion of passive states. The main result of the pa-
per is instead presented in Sec. III where we ﬁrst deﬁne
in a rigorous way the class of lossy maps we are inter-
ested in and then proceed with a formal proof the opti-
mality for passive states. Section IV is instead devoted
to counterexamples. In particular in Sec. IV A we show
that for the two-mode bosonic Gaussian quantum-limited
attenuator, whose associated Hamiltonian is degenerate,
no majorization relations can be ascribed to the passive
states. In Sec.IV B instead a counterexample is provided
for a two-qubit lossy map with two diﬀerent choices of
the Hamiltonian. In one case, the Hamiltonian is non-
degenerate, but the process involves quantum jumps of
more than one energy step. In the other case, only quan-
tum jumps of one energy step are allowed, but the Hamil-

tonian becomes degenerate. In Sec. IV C we ﬁnally ana-
lyze the case of a map where the bath temperature is not
zero showing that in this case the optimal input states are
a pure coherent superposition of the Hamiltonian eigen-
states, hence non passive. Conclusions and comments
are presented in Sec. V while technical derivations are
presented in the appendices.

II. MAJORIZATION

Majorization is a concept that gives a precise meaning
to the proposition “the quantum state ˆρ (or the proba-
bility distribution p) is less disordered that the quantum
state ˆσ (or the probability distribution q)”. The inter-
ested reader can ﬁnd more details in the dedicated book
[6].

Let us start with the deﬁnition for probability distri-

butions:

Deﬁnition II.1 (Majorization). Let p and q be two dis-
crete probability distributions on a set of d ∈ N elements
with

p1 ≥ . . . ≥ pd ,

q1 ≥ . . . ≥ qd .

(II.1)

We say that p majorizes q, or p ≻ q, iﬀ

(II.2)

Deﬁnition II.1 can be easily extended to quantum

states:

Deﬁnition II.2. Let ˆρ and ˆσ be quantum states on Cd
with eigenvalues p1 ≥ . . . ≥ pd and q1 ≥ . . . ≥ qd, respec-
tively. We say that ˆρ majorizes ˆσ, or ˆρ ≻ ˆσ, iﬀ p ≻ q.

From an operational point of view, and for the appli-
cations in quantum information and quantum thermody-
namics, it is useful to express majorization as the order
relation induced by random unitary operations (see Sec.
II.C of [20]):

Theorem II.3. Given two quantum states ˆρ and ˆσ, the
following conditions are equivalent:

1. ˆρ ≻ ˆσ;
2. For any convex function f : [0, 1] → R,

Tr f (ˆρ) ≥ Tr f (ˆσ) .

(II.3)

Taking f (x) = x ln x and f (x) = xp, p > 1, (II.3)
implies that the von Neumann and all the R´enyi
entropies [21] of ˆρ are lower than the corresponding
ones of ˆσ;

3. ˆσ can be obtained applying to ˆρ random unitary op-
erators, i.e. there exist a probability distribution p
and unitary operators ˆUi such that

A self-adjoint operator is passive [1, 2] if it is diagonal
in the eigenbasis of the Hamiltonian and its eigenvalues
decrease as the energy increases.

Deﬁnition II.4 (Passive rearrangement). Let ˆX be a
self-adjoint operator with eigenvalues x1 ≥ . . . ≥ xd. We
deﬁne its passive rearrangement as

ˆX ↓ :=

This dynamics can arise from a weak interaction with
a large Markovian bath in its zero-temperature (i.e.
ground) state in the rotating-wave approximation (see
[22, 23]), such that the interaction Hamiltonian ˆVSB cou-
ples only neighbouring energy levels of the system:

Indeed, in the
i
rotating-wave approximation only the transitions that
conserve the energy associated to the noninteracting
Hamiltonian are allowed.
If the bath is in its ground
state, it cannot transfer energy to the system, and only
the transitions that decrease its energy are possible.

It is easy to show that, if ˆρ is diagonal in the energy
eigenbasis, also L (ˆρ) is diagonal in the same basis, hence
etL (ˆρ) remains diagonal for any t.
To derive our result we suppose also that the operator

L(cid:16)ˆI(cid:17) is passive. This condition might seem technical,
but as mentioned in the introduction it must actually
hold if for any t ≥ 0 the channel etL sends the maximally
mixed state into a passive state (see Section A 1). Of
course, since the maximally mixed state is itself a passive
state, this last requirement is necessary if we want to
prove at the end that the channel etL preserves the set
of passive states.

We can compute

(III.7)

The ﬁrst main result of this paper is that passive states
optimize the output of the quantum channel generated by
any dissipator of the form (III.1) satisfying these addi-
tional hypotheses, i.e. the output generated by any pas-
sive state majorizes the output generated by any other
state with the same spectrum: for any state ˆρ and any
t ≥ 0,

etL (ˆρ) ≺ etL(cid:0)ˆρ↓(cid:1) .

Moreover, for any t ≥ 0 the state etL(cid:0)ˆρ↓(cid:1) is still passive,

i.e. the quantum channel etL preserves the set of passive
states. The proof closely follows [15], and is contained in
the next section.

(III.8)

The quantum states with non-degenerate spectrum are
dense in the set of all quantum states. Besides, the spec-
trum is a continuous function of the operator, and any
linear map is continuous. Then, without loss of general-
ity we can suppose that ˆρ has non-degenerate spectrum.
Let p1(t) ≥ . . . ≥ pd(t) be the eigenvalues of ˆρ(t), and let

sn(t) =

Notice that p(0) = p↓(0) and then s(0) = s↓(0), where

p(t) = (p1(t), . . . , pd(t)) ,

(III.13)

and similarly for s(t). The proof comes from:

Lemma III.1. The spectrum of ˆρ(t) can be degenerate
at most in isolated points.

Proof. See Section A 2 in the Appendix.

Lemma III.2. s(t) is continuous in t, and for any t ≥ 0
such that ˆρ(t) has non-degenerate spectrum it satisﬁes

sn(t) ≤ λn(sn+1(t) − sn(t)) ,

where

λn = Trh ˆΠ↓

(III.15)

Lemma III.3. If s(t) is continuous in t and satis-
ﬁes (III.14), then sn(t) ≤ s↓
n(t) for any t ≥ 0 and
n = 1, . . . , d.

Proof. See section A 4 in the Appendix.

Lemma III.3 implies that for any t ≥ 0 the quantum
channel etL preserves the set of passive states. Indeed, let
us choose the initial state ˆρ already passive. Then, sn(t)
is the sum of the n largest eigenvalues of etL (ˆρ). Recall-
ing that etL (ˆρ) is diagonal in the Hamiltonian eigenba-
sis, s↓
n(t) is the sum of the eigenvalues corresponding to
|ni,
the ﬁrst n eigenstates of the Hamiltonian |1i,

etL (ˆρ) preserves the set of passive states for any t.

n(t) ≤ sn(t). However, Lemma III.3 implies

in the deﬁnition of the passive rearrangement of quantum

Consider for example

III.3 again,

etL (ˆρ) ≺ etL(cid:0)ˆρ↓(cid:1)

(III.16)

for any ˆρ, and the passive states are the optimal inputs
for the channel.

IV. COUNTEREXAMPLES

In this section we show that by dropping the hypoth-
esis introduced at the beginning of Sec. III one can ﬁnd
counterexamples of maps for which Eq. (III.8) does not
hold.

A. Gaussian attenuator with degenerate

Hamiltonian

The hypothesis of non-degenerate Hamiltonian is nec-
essary for the optimality of passive states. Indeed, in this
section we provide an explicit counterexample with de-
generate Hamiltonian: the two-mode bosonic Gaussian
quantum-limited attenuator [21, 24].

Let us consider the Hamiltonian of an harmonic oscil-

ˆρ =

(IV.6)

It is easy to show that it minimizes the average energy
among the states with the same spectrum, i.e. it is pas-
sive. Moreover, there are no other states with the same
spectrum and the same average energy, i.e.
its passive
rearrangement is unique. Consider instead

ˆσ =

(IV.7)

that has the same spectrum of ˆρ, but it has a higher
average energy and it is not passive. The three largest
eigenvalues of Et (ˆρ) are associated with the eigenvectors
|0, 0i, |0, 1i and |1, 0i, and their sum is

On the other side, the three largest eigenvalues of Et (ˆσ)
are associated with the eigenvectors |0, 0i,
|0, 1i and
|0, 2i, and their sum is

˜s3(t) = 1 − e−3t 5 − 6e−t + 2e−2t

It is then easy to see that for

i.e. the passive state ˆρ is not the optimal input. Let p1(t)
and ˜p1(t) be the largest eigenvalues of Et (ˆρ) and Et (ˆσ),
respectively. They are both associated to the eigenvector
|0, 0i, and
p1(t) =

6 − 8e−t + 3e−2t

(IV.3)

The quantum-limited attenuator is the channel etL gener-
ated by the Lindbladian (IV.2). In Ref. [15] it is proven
that this quantum channel preserves the set of passive
states, and they are its optimal inputs in the sense of Eq.
(III.8). Here we will show that this last property does no
more hold for the two-mode attenuator

Et := etL ⊗ etL .

(IV.4)

For any t > 0

In this case, the Hamiltonian becomes degenerate:

However, the two Lindblad operators ˆa ⊗ ˆI and ˆI ⊗ ˆa can
still induce only jumps between a given energy level and

so that ˆσ is not the optimal input, and for t > t0 no
majorization relation holds between Et (ˆρ) and Et (ˆσ).
This counterexample cannot be ascribed to the inﬁnite
dimension of the Hilbert space, since it is easy to see that
both the supports of Et (ˆρ) and Et (ˆσ) do not depend on
t and have dimension 6.

We consider a quantum lossy channel acting on the
quantum system of two qubits with two possible choices
for the Hamiltonian, and we show that passive states are
not the optimal inputs in the sense of (III.8).
In one
case the Hamiltonian is non-degenerate, but the channel
involves quantum jumps of more than one energy step.
In the other case, only quantum jumps of one energy step
are allowed, but the Hamiltonian becomes degenerate.

Let us consider the Hilbert space of two spins with

Hamiltonian

ˆH = E1 |1ih1| ⊗ ˆI + E2 ˆI ⊗ |1ih1| .

(IV.16)

Let us suppose that

0 < E2 ≤ E1 ,

(IV.17)

so that the eigenvectors of ˆH are, in order of increasing
energy,

ˆH|0, 0i = 0
ˆH|0, 1i = E2|0, 1i
ˆH|1, 0i = E1|1, 0i
ˆH|1, 1i = (E1 + E2)|1, 1i ,

(IV.18)

with the only possible degeneracy between |0, 1i and |1, 0i
if E1 = E2.
Let L be the generator of the form (III.1) with the two

Lindblad operators

ˆL1 = |0, 0ih1, 0|
ˆL2 = |0, 0ih0, 1| + √2 |0, 1ih1, 1| ,

(IV.19)

and let

(IV.20)

Et = etL ,

t ≥ 0 ,
be the associated quantum channel.
If E2 < E1 the
Hamiltonian is non-degenerate, but the Lindblad opera-
tor ˆL2 can induce a transition from |1, 1i to |0, 1i, that are
not consecutive eigenstates. On the contrary, if E1 = E2
the Hamiltonian is degenerate, but both Lindblad oper-
ators induce only transitions between consecutive energy
levels.

(IV.36)

In this section we show that at ﬁnite temperature, al-
ready for a two-level system the optimal states are no
more passive, and include coherent superpositions of the
energy eigenstates.

An intuitive explanation is that a dissipator with
only energy-raising Lindblad operators keeps ﬁxed the
maximum-energy eigenstate, that is hence optimal for
the generated channel. Then, it is natural to expect that
the optimal pure state in the presence of both energy-
lowering and energy-raising Lindblad operators will in-
terpolate between the ground and the maximum energy
state, and will hence be a coherent superposition of dif-
ferent eigenstates of the Hamiltonian.

The simplest example is a two-level system with Hamil-

tonian

and N > 0 is the average number of photons or phonons
in the bosonic mode of the bath coupled to the system.
Notice also that for N = 0 the process becomes a lossy
map fulﬁlling the condition discussed at the beginning of
Sec. III.

We will now show that, for the quantum channel asso-
ciated to the master equation (IV.32), the output gener-
ated by a certain coherent superposition of the two en-
ergy eigenstates majorizes the output generated by any
other state.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have extended the proof of the opti-
mality of passive states of Ref. [15] to a large class of lossy
channels, showing that they preserve the set of passive
states, that are the optimal inputs in the sense that the

2. Proof of Lemma III.1

The matrix elements of the operator etL (ˆρ) are ana-
lytic functions of t. The spectrum of ˆρ(t) is degenerate
iﬀ the function

φ(t) =Yi6=j

(pi(t) − pj(t))

(A.5)

vanishes. This function is a symmetric polynomial in the
eigenvalues of ˆρ(t) = etL (ˆρ). Then, for the Fundamen-
tal Theorem of Symmetric Polynomials (see e.g Theorem
3 in Chapter 7 of [25]), φ(t) can be written as a poly-
nomial in the elementary symmetric polynomials in the
eigenvalues of ˆρ(t). However, these polynomials coincide
with the coeﬃcients of the characteristic polynomial of
ˆρ(t), that are in turn polynomials in its matrix elements.
It follows that φ(t) can be written as a polynomial in the
matrix elements of the operator ˆρ(t). Since each of these
matrix element is an analytic function of t, also φ(t) is
analytic. Since by hypothesis the spectrum of ˆρ(0) is non-
degenerate, φ cannot be identically zero, and its zeroes
are isolated points.

3. Proof of Lemma III.2

The matrix elements of the operator etL (ˆρ) are ana-
lytic (and hence continuous and diﬀerentiable) functions
of t. Then for Weyl’s Perturbation Theorem p(t) is con-
tinuous in t, and also s(t) is continuous (see e.g. Corollary
III.2.6 and the discussion at the beginning of Chapter VI
of [26]). Let ˆρ(t0) have non-degenerate spectrum. Then,
ˆρ(t) has non-degenerate spectrum for any t in a suitable
neighbourhood of t0. In this neighbourhood, we can di-
agonalize ˆρ(t) with

ˆρ(t) =

d

Xi=1

pi(t)|ψi(t)ihψi(t)| ,

(A.6)

where the eigenvalues in decreasing order pi(t) are diﬀer-
entiable functions of t (see Theorem 6.3.12 of [27]). We
then have

pi(t) = hψi(t)|L ( ˆρ(t)) |ψi(t)i ,

output generated by a passive state majorizes the output
generated by any other state with the same spectrum.
Then, thanks to the equivalent deﬁnition of majorization
in terms of random unitary operations (II.4), the out-
put generated by a passive state minimizes any concave
functional among the outputs generated by any unitary
equivalent state. Since the class of concave functionals
includes the von Neumann and all the R´enyi entropies,
the solution to any entropic optimization problem has to
be found among passive states. This result can then lead
to entropic inequalities on the output of a lossy channel,
and can be crucial in the determination of its information
capacity. Moreover, it can certainly ﬁnd applications in
quantum thermodynamics.

The optimality of passive states crucially depends on
the assumptions of non-degeneracy of the Hamiltonian,
quantum jumps of only one energy step and zero temper-
ature. Indeed, the two-mode bosonic Gaussian quantum-
limited attenuator provides a counterexample with de-
generate Hamiltonian. Moreover, two-qubit systems can
provide counterexamples both with degenerate Hamilto-
nian or with quantum jumps of more than one energy
step. Finally, at ﬁnite temperature this optimality prop-
erty fails already for a two-level system, where the best
input is a coherent superposition of the two energy eigen-
states. This shows that even the quantum channels that
naturally arise from a weak interaction with a thermal
bath can have a very complex entropic behaviour, and
that coherence can play a crucial role in the optimal en-
coding of information.

1. Passivity of the evolved maximally mixed state

Lemma A.1. Let L be a Lindblad generator such that
for any t ≥ 0 the operator etL(cid:16)ˆI(cid:17) is passive. Then, also
L(cid:16)ˆI(cid:17) is passive.
Proof. Recalling the Hamiltonian eigenbasis (II.5), for
any t ≥ 0 it must hold

ﬁrst term of (A.13), we get

Trh ˆΠn(t) L(cid:16) ˆΠk(t)(cid:17)i ≤ 0 .

On the other hand, recalling the structure of the
