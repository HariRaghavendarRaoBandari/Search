Abstract

The localization of the valence electron of H, Li and N a atoms enclosed by three diﬀerent

fullerene molecules is studied. The structure of the fullerene molecules is used to calculate the

equilibrium position of the endohedrally atom as the minimum of the classical (N + 1)-body

Lennard-Jones potential. Once the position of the guest atom is determined, the fullerene cavity is

modeled by a short range attractive shell according to molecule symmetry, and the enclosed atom

is modeled by an eﬀective one-electron potential.

In order to examine whether the endohedral

compound is formed by a neutral atom inside a neutral fullerene molecule X@CN or if the valence

electron of the encapsulated atom localizes in the fullerene giving rise to a state with the form

X +@C −

N , we analyze the electronic density, the projections onto free atomic states, and the weights

of partial angular waves.

INTRODUCTION

Fullerenes are stable carbon molecules with spherical, ellipsoidal or cylindrical hollow

shape. The existence of these carbon structures was theoretically predicted by diﬀerent

authors between 1965 and 1975 [1–3], but it was not until 1985 that Kroto et al. observed

C60 [4–7].

Fullerene molecules, together with graphene and carbon nanotubes, are of considerable

interest to researchers from many scientiﬁc areas and have multiple possible applications,

specially on nanotechnology. Their unique mechanical and electronic properties, such as low

weight, high strength, ﬂexibility and thermal stability, make this carbon structures quite

suitable for the creation of nano-devices [8, 9].

One of the most important features of fullerene molecules is that they can harbor atoms

in their interior constituting endohedral compounds, denoted by X@CN [10–17], whose main

advantage is the isolation of the enclosed atom from its environment. Endohedral atoms

can be produced in laboratories [18–25], and many technological applications, such as drugs-

delivery agents, molecular containers, hydrogen or lithium storage, are now in development

[26].

Previous research mostly aimed to investigate the shell structure and spectral properties

of X@C60, in which the enclosed atom is located right at the geometrical center of C60,

and the fullerene molecule is modeled by a short-range spherical shell with an attractive

potential [26–34]. Nevertheless, for larger fullerene molecules the equilibrium position of the

conﬁned atom is no longer the geometrical center of the molecule [35, 36].

The purpose of the present work is to calculate and describe the physically expected

diﬀerences between the electronic states of the atom conﬁned by the fullerene cage and their

free state. We focus on the systems X@CN , where X = H, Li, N a, and N = 80, 180. The

chosen C80 isomers were C80 − D2 − 2 and C80 − D5d − 1 because they are the only two

isomers that have been prepared and characterized as pristine structures [37].

Each of these fullerene molecules was modeled by a short range shell according to molecule

symmetry. C180 was modeled by a spherical shell, while both C80 isomers were described by

an ellipsoidal shell with proper parameters.

The fundamental question underlying our work could be stated in the following way: is

the endohedral compound formed by a neutral atom inside a neutral fullerene (X@CN ), or

2

does the valence electron of the encapsulated atom localize into the fullerene shell, giving

rise to a zwitterion-like state (X +@C −

N )?

In order to understand the transference of the valence electron to the fullerene cage

X@CN → X +@C −

N , we analyze the electronic density, the projections onto free atomic

states, and the weights of partial angular waves as a function of the attraction that the

fullerene exerts upon the valence electron.

It is important to mention that the short range spherical (or ellipsoidal) potential for the

fullerene cage is indeed a very simple approach; even so, this model explains and provides

a good description of the system and its properties. There are plenty of studies of the

electronic structure as well as photoionization of X@C60 where the fullerene molecule is

modeled as a spherical short range shell [38–42], which show an excellent agreement with

another theoretical studies as well as with the experimental photoionization cross section or

electron elastic scattering cross section [43–47].

This paper is organized as follows. In the second section, we present a complete descrip-

tion of the theoretical method; the third section is focused on the computation, results and

discussion. Finally, our conclusions are given in the fourth section.

II. MODEL AND THEORETICAL METHODS

In a ﬁrst step we used the structure of the fullerene molecules to obtain the position

of the conﬁned atom as the minimum of the classical (N + 1)-body potential as explained

in Sec. II A. Once the position of the atom is determined, the electronic structure of the

enclosed atom is calculated modelling the fullerene as a spherical or ellipsoidal square well

according to the symmetry of the fullerene molecule.

A. Determination of the position of the conﬁned atom

We model the interaction between the X atom and the carbon fullerene using the non-

bonded classical Lennard-Jones potential with each carbon atom of the CN .

calculated along a line

between the center of the CN molecule and one of its carbon atoms. The calculations were

made with N = 60, 80, 180, 320, and the locations of the carbon atoms were ﬁxed according

to the structure of the fullerene molecules. The ﬁgure shows that only for C60 we obtained

~x0 = 0 as the position of the equilibrium minimum. For larger fullerenes, the conﬁned atom

is no longer located at the geometrical center of the fullerene.

B.

Electronic States

Most of the studies on X@CN have been done with N = 60 and the endohedral atom

located at the center of the fullerene modeled by a spherical potential [26–34]. However,

as it is shown in Fig. 1, for N > 60 the equilibrium position of the conﬁned atom is not

the fullerene center. In these cases the system is not spherically symmetric, therefore the

Schr¨odinger equation is not separable into radial and angular variables.

The system X@CN was modeled using the following one-electron Hamiltonian

where the potential VF models the fullerene-electron interaction, and the potential VX repre-

sents the interaction of the valence electron with the multi-electron core. For X = H, Li, N a

we used a one-electron potential model for their valence electron, which includes the average

eﬀects of the inner electrons [52–59],

where r is the distance between the outer electron and the nucleus. The ﬁtting parameters

(see Table II) were taken from Ref.

[56], in which the authors chose them in order to

reproduce the best values of the energy levels of the free atom compared with experimental

results. In the Li case the potential parameter α = β = γ describes the eﬀective charge

of the 1s2 core. Notice that for X = H, Nc = 0 and thus VH reduces to the Coulombic

electron-proton interaction.

The fullerene-valence electron interaction potential VF is modeled by a short-range shell.

TABLE III. Spherical and ellipsoidal parameters for CN .

Our workhorse for the calculation of the electronic states is the Ritz-variational method

with real square-integrable, compact support, and boundary conditions adaptable basis sets.

Since the Hamiltonian is invariant in respect to rotation about z-axis, the wavefunction can

be written as

Ψ(~x) =

u(r, θ)

r

ΦLz (φ) ,

(7)

where ΦLz is a normalized eigenfunction of Lz, the z-component of angular momentum. We

used B-Splines to expand u(r, θ),

u(r, θ) = Xi,j

ci,j Bi,k(r) Bj,˜k(θ) ,

(8)

6

Bi,k(r), Bj,˜k(θ) are radial and angular B-Splines polynomial of order k and ˜k, deﬁned in
the intervals [0, rmax] and [0, π] respectively. Once we deﬁned the basis-set, the Schr¨odinger

equation can be expressed in matrix form H ~c = E S ~c, where E is the energy, ~c is the

coeﬃcient vector of the electronic state, and S the basis overlap matrix. This method pro-

vides the electronic structure (orbitals and energy levels) by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian

matrix.

The numerical results are obtained by deﬁning a cutoﬀ radius rmax, and then the interval

[0, rmax] is divided into I equal subintervals. B-spline polynomials [60, 61] are piecewise

polynomials deﬁned by a sequence of knots t1 = 0 ≤ t2 ≤ · · · ≤ t2k+I−1 = rmax and the

recurrence relations

Bi,1(r) = 


r − ti

ti+k−1 − ti

Bi,k−1(r) +

ti+k − r
ti+k − ti+1

Bi,k−1(r) (k > 1) .

(10)

In our calculations we have used seventh-order B-Splines in both variables. The sequences

of knots were chosen in order to suit the boundary conditions of the problem. In the angular
variable the knots sequences have ˜k multiple knots in θ = 0, π. In the radial variable the

knots sequences have k multiple knots in r = 0, rmax ; k − 2 multiple knots in the atom

position (cusp-condition) and only in the case of the spherical model, k − 3 multiple knots

in the internal an external radius of the spherical shell.

It is worth mentioning that in the angular variable the sequences of knots have a Gauss-

Legendre-quadrature-points distribution, whose advantages have been previously discussed

in the literature [35, 36].

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In order to obtain the position of the conﬁned atom we minimized the interaction potential

between the X atom and the carbon atoms of the fullerene molecule Eq. (1), where the

locations of the carbon atoms were ﬁxed according to the structure of each fullerene from

Ref. [48].

7

Because of the well deﬁned spherical shape of C180 − 0, the position of the endohedral

atom is the Euclidean norm of the absolute minimum vector ~x0 obtained by Eq. (2).

C80 − D2 − 2 and C80 − D5d − 1 exhibit ellipsoidal shape, slightly broken by the discrete

nature of the fullerene. Thus, instead of the expected two degenerate global minima along the

major axis of the molecule for the ellipsoidal symmetry, the (N + 1)-body potential presents

a global and a second quasi-degenerated minima along the major axis. The equilibrium

positions |~x0| for each case are presented in Table IV.

TABLE IV. Equilibrium position |~x0| of X@CN .

Once the equilibrium position of the enclosed atom was determined, we focused on the

valence electron states.

In order to study how the spectral properties of H, Li and N a

atoms are modiﬁed by the carbon cage, our calculations included values of the depth of the

attractive shell U0 in the [0, 1.5] range.

The ﬁrst four energy levels of the encapsulated atoms for each fullerene are depicted in

Fig. 2 as a function of U0, C80 − D2 − 2 in full black line, C80 − D5d − 1 in dash-dotted

orange line, and C180 − 0 in gray dash-dotted line.

Even when the main spectrum diﬀerence is between the C80 isomers and C180 − 0, this

diﬀerence is small because the distance between the core atom X and the fullerene shell is

determinated by σ(X), and it is almost independent of the size of CN (see Tables I, III, and

IV).

Notice that when varying the depth of the shell, even for values of U0 > 0.6, the ground

state of H remains stable at the ionization energy of the free atom ground state E0 = −0.5 au,

a behaviour that has also been observed for the C60 case in Ref. [32]. In other words, given

that the ground electronic state of hydrogen is highly localized around the nucleus, it is not

inﬂuenced by the outer conﬁning well unless the fullerene becomes suﬃciently attractive.

The other H states, as well as the Li and N a states, are inﬂuenced by the attractive fullerene

shell even for small U0 values because all of these states are delocalized states.

The Ritz-variational method provides not only the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian matrix,

but also the eigenfunctions. The probability density of ﬁnding the valence electron around

a position given by r, θ is proportional to r2ρ(r, θ) dr dθ = u2(r, θ) dr dθ, where u(r, θ) is

deﬁned in Eq. (7).

The probability of ﬁnding the valence electron on the xz plane for the ground (n = 1)

and ﬁrst excited wavefunctions (n = 2) of X@C80 − D2 − 2 are depicted in Fig. 3, where

the enclosed atom is located in the positive z-axis at the positions given in Table IV.

This ﬁgure shows several interesting features. First of all, the symmetry of the localization

in the fullerene shell depends both on the distance between the enclosed atom and the

geometrical center of the molecule (origin of coordinates) and on the symmetry of the atomic

free (U0 = 0) states (s-wave for ground state and p-wave for ﬁrst excited state).

It is physically expected that an electron in an s-wave with no spatial-direction preference

will be localized in the nearest part of the fullerene shell. In the case of an electron in a

p-wave with spatial preference for the z positive and negative axis, denoted by z+ and z−,

this spatial preference and the tendency to localizing in the nearest part of the fullerene

attractive shell will compete. The decisive variable in this competition is the distance

between the enclosed atom and the geometrical center of the fullerene.

In the case of N a, whose nucleus is located closer to the geometrical center of the fullerene,

the valence electron in the ground state will localize in the whole fullerene shell when the

9

fullerene gets increasingly attractive. An electron in the ﬁrst excited state of N a will localize

mostly on the upper and lower “hemispheres” of the fullerene shell, in a p-wave symmetric

shape.

In the case of Li, whose nucleus locates the farthest from the geometrical center of the

fullerene, the valence electron in the ground state will localize on the nearest part of the

fullerene shell, which is the upper “hemisphere”. An electron in the ﬁrst excited state of Li

will also localize on the lower “hemisphere” due to the p-wave symmetry of the initial state

(U0 = 0).

As mentioned above, the ground H state remains unchanged until the fullerene shell

becomes suﬃciently attractive (U0 ∼ 0.73), and for U0 values above this critical value, the

electron becomes localized on the fullerene shell.

The ﬁrst excited H state presents a quite interesting phenomenon which coincides with

U0 values for the anticrossing energy levels, U0 ∼ [0.6, 0.76] in Fig. 2. By increasing the U0

values in the range U0 ∼ [0, 0.6] the electron becomes localized in the fullerene, and for the

anticrossing values U0 ∼ [0.6, 0.76] the electron is conﬁned into the atom and relocalized in

the fullerene with a new symmetry. A similar eﬀect was originally described and termed

mirror collapse by Connerade et al. for the C60 case in Ref. [28].

With the aim of clarifying these features, we calculated as a function of U0 the probability

of ﬁnding the valence electron inside the fullerene cage,

ρin = hΨ(~x)|Ψ(~x)iVfin

= Z π

0 Z R(θ)−∆

u2(r, θ) dr sin θ dθ ,

(11)

where Vfin is the inner volume of the fullerene. We also calculated the probability of ﬁnding

the valence electron in the positive upper “hemisphere” of the fullerene shell, denoted by

ρf +,

ρf + = hΨ(~x)|Ψ(~x)iVf + = Z

0 Z R(θ)+∆

where Vf + is the volume of the upper “hemisphere” of the fullerene molecule. The probability

of ﬁnding the valence electron in the lower “hemisphere” of the fullerene ρf − is deﬁned in a

similar manner. These probabilities are shown in Fig. 4 for the ground state and in Fig. 5

for the ﬁrst excited state.

It is clear that the valence electron of Li and N a becomes localized in the fullerene shell

as soon as the interaction with the fullerene is non-zero, and this localization takes place in

a soft and monotonic way.

The studied hydrogen electronic states show a diﬀerent behaviour. The ground state

localization occurs in a step-like way at U0 ∼ 0.73, as one can see from the staggered curves

of ρin, ρf + and ρf − in Fig. 4. The mentioned re-conﬁnement of the excited state in a narrow

U0 range is exposed in the high peak of ρin (Fig. 5 (a)) for U0 ∼ [0.6, 0.76] in the case of

C80 isomers and in the [0.65, 0.82] range for C180. As expected, for these values of U0, ρf +,

and ρf − undergo an appreciable decrease.

As it is shown in Fig. 4 and 5, the main diﬀerence in electron localization is between C80

isomers and C180. For C180, the nucleus of the enclosed atom locates at the largest distance

from the lower “hemisphere” of the fullerene; as a consequence, the valence electron ground

state for all the elements becomes localized only in f + (Fig. 4), and the ﬁrst excited states

(p wave for U0 = 0) becomes localized mostly in f + and shows poor localization in f − (Fig.

5).

For C80 cases, since the N a nucleus locates the closest to the geometrical center of the

fullerene, its states show a very equilibrated localization, which is more pronounced for n = 2

(Fig. 5 (b)). The valence electron of Li in the ground state shows a complete localization

in f +, and as is expected given the symmetry of the initial state, the excited state displays

a more equilibrate localization between f + and f −.

Now, one could ask if the re-conﬁnement of the excited state in the hydrogen case is a

re-conﬁnement into the atom or just into the inner volume of the fullerene. To answer this

question we calculated the projections onto the free atomic states i.e. without interaction

with the fullerene (U0 = 0),

Λn,n0 = hΨn(U0)|Ψn0(U0 = 0)i ,

(13)

where n0 = 1, 2 denote the ground and excited free atomic states. The projection of the

ﬁrst excited state of H onto the ground atomic free state is displayed in Fig. 6, which shows

that the re-localization of the H excited state is a re-conﬁnement into the atom in a state

that is quite similar to the atomic free ground state, and not only the return of the electron

to the inner fullerene cage.

Finally, we performed an analysis of the mixing of diﬀerent angular partial waves. For

this purpose we followed Kang et al.

[36] and calculated the partial wave-weights of the

The partial weights of s, p and d-waves as a function of U0 are shown in Fig. 7 for the

As expected, the larger the distance between the nucleus of the enclosed atom and the

geometrical center of the fullerene is, the more the partial waves get mixed. Therefore, the

Li states present a higher mixing of partial angular waves (see Fig. 7 (c) and (d)) while N a

shows the purest wave-states; the valence electron ground state of N a is mostly an s-wave

(see Fig. 7 (e)) and its excited states, a p-wave (Fig. 7 (f)).

All of the hydrogen weights exhibit a quasi-critical behavior at U0 = U (c)

0 ∼ 0.73 (see Fig.

7 (a) and (b)). In particular, the ﬁrst excited state of H@C80 switches its principal partial

angular weight from s to p as can be seen in Fig. 7 (b). This means that by increasing from

zero the values of U0, the electron becomes localized in the fullerene as an s-wave. After
that, for U0 values in a small interval around the anticrossing value U (c)

0 , the electron is

conﬁned into the atom and relocalized in the fullerene, but this time as a p-wave.

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In this work we described how the valence electron of H, Li and N a atoms enclosed by

three diﬀerent fullerene molecules (C80 − D2 − 2, C80 − D5d − 1 and C180 − 0) localizes in

the fullerene when the strength of the attractive molecule cage increases.

We used the structure of the fullerene molecules to calculate the equilibrium position

of the endohedrally atom as the minimum of the classical (N + 1)-body Lennard-Jones

potential. From LJ parameters (Table I) we obtained that Li atoms locate farther than H

15

and N a atoms in all cases.

Once the position of the enclosed atom was determined, the fullerene molecules were

modeled by a short range attractive shell according to molecule symmetry, and the enclosed

atoms were modeled by an eﬀective one-electron potential. C180 was modeled by a spherical

shell, while both C80 isomers were described by an ellipsoidal shell with proper parameters.

We found that the localization of the valence electron on the fullerene shell depends on

the distance between the nucleus of the enclosed atom and the geometrical center of the

fullerene, as well as on the symmetry of the atomic free states i.e. without interaction with

the fullerene cage. As we expected, the main diﬀerences between fullerene molecules were

observed when comparing C180 and C80 isomers.

The Li and N a valence electron becomes localized in the fullerene shell continuously and

monotonically as soon as the interaction with the fullerene is non-zero. Thus, Li and N a

atoms inside a fullerene cage present zwitterion-like states i.e. the endohedral compound

has the form Li+@C −

N and N a+@C −
N .

The hydrogen electronic states present a diﬀerent behavior. In order to understand it,

we analyzed the electron probability density, the projections onto free atomic states and the

weights of partial angular waves. The H ground state remains unaltered until U0 values

get over ∼ 0.73; beyond this value the electron becomes localized in the fullerene shell in a

step-like way. Therefore, the endohedral compound in the case of hydrogen is formed by a

neutral atom inside a neutral fullerene H@CN .

The ﬁrst excited H state presents a quite interesting phenomenon which coincides with U0

values for the anticrossing energy levels. Increasing U0 while still remaining under the anti-

crossing values, the electron becomes localized in the fullerene as an s-wave. For anticrossing

values the electron is conﬁned into the atom in a state similar to the atomic free ground

state. When U0 takes values slightly above the anticrossing, the electron is re-localized in

the fullerene shell as a p-wave. This switching of the principal partial angular weight could

be a possible way to deﬁne the avoided crossing U0 value.

We would like to make some ﬁnal remarks on one of the possible applications of the

simple approach used in the present work. So far, Light Induced Conical Intersection (LICI)

as ﬁrst proposed by M. Sindelka, N. Moiseyev and L.S. Cederbaum was applied to diatomic

molecules in running and standing laser waves [63]. Within the present approach it is possible

to study the coupling between nuclear and electronic modes in endohedral compounds when

16

a conical intersection [64] between electronic levels is induced by laser waves. Work is in

progress in this direction.
