Square

Abstract

In their 2009 note: Packing equal squares into a large square, Chung and

Graham proved that the uncovered area of a large square of side length x

is O(cid:16)x(3+√2)/7 log x(cid:17) after maximum number of non-overlapping unit squares

are packed into it, which improved the earlier results of Erd˝os-Graham, Roth-

Vaughan, and Karabash-Soifer. Here we further improve the result to O(x5/8)

that also helps to improve the bound for the dual problem: ﬁnding the mini-

mum number of unit squares needed for covering the large square, from x2 +

O(cid:16)x(3+√2)/7 log x(cid:17) to x2 + O(x5/8).

Key words: Packing, covering, “wasted” area, Taylor’s formula

1. Introduction

In 1975, Erd˝os and Graham [1] investigated the problem of packing a square

of side length x with as many non-overlapping unit squares as possible, in other

words the uncovered area should be as small as possible. From then on, the

5

problem have already been well studied in the literature [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8],

in which [2, 5, 6] focus on the case when x is large enough. Following [5], we

call the problem Packing Waste Problem. Also, there is a dual problem, called

Covering Waste Problem in [5], that is concerned with covering the square with

minimium number of unit squares[5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12].

10

Erd˝os and Graham obtained the ﬁrst estimation of Packing Waste Problem

as O(x7/11) [1]. Later, D. Karabash and A. Soifer in [9] gave the estimation of

Covering Waste Problem as O(x2/3) that was improved in [5] to O(x7/11). In

2009, Chung and Graham [6] found the best previous bound O(cid:16)x(3+√2)/7 log x(cid:17)

for both problems.

15

In this paper we use basic analysis tools to improve the result of Chung and

Graham to O(x5/8) also for both problems.

2. Preliminary

Let A be a closed planar region and S(A) the area of it. We deﬁne two

functions

W (A) = S(A) − sup s(Aλ),
W ′(A) = inf s(A′λ) − S(A).

where Aλ ⊂ A is a union set of non-overlapping unit squares, and A′λ ⊃ A
is a union set of unit squares (non-overlapping is not necessary). Specially,

20

when A is a square of side length x, we denote W (A), W ′(A) as W (x), W ′(x)

respectively.

To our opinion, the basic task of Packing or Covering Waste Problem is

packing or covering a strip of non-integer width [6], say m. Usual method for

25

packing a strip [6] is to pack stacks of non-overlapping unit squares of height
⌈m⌉ into the strip as close to being orthogonal as possible (see Fig. 1), namely
minimize the angle θ in Fig. 1 which satisﬁes

⌈m⌉ cos θ + sin θ = m.

(1)

Let r = m − ⌊m⌋. Obviously when r = 0, then θ = 0 trivially. Otherwise, we
let θ = αmβ + o(mβ), which leads to the following result by comparing with the

constant term of (1),

θ = √2 − r m−1/2 + o(m−1/2).

Similarly, we also use stacks of unit squares of height ⌈m⌉ (see Fig. 2) to

cover the strip, then angle θ′ in Fig. 2 satisﬁes

⌈m⌉ cos θ′ − sin θ′ = m.

(2)

We also have θ′ = 0 when r = 0. If not, then

θ′ = √2 − r m−1/2 + o(m−1/2).

Note that when m → ∞, θ and θ′ < √2 m−1/2.

3. Packing Waste Problem

In this section, we will present our main result on Packing Waste Problem.

For the proof of it, three types of basic shapes are introduced as follows.

Type 1 shape Rectangle T1 has a length x and width x′ (see subﬁgure (a) of

Fig. 3) satisfying x3/4 ≤ x′ ≤ cx with c ≤ 7 a constant.

Type 2 shape Right trapezoid T2 has a height of x, a top edge of length x′
(see subﬁgure (b) of Fig. 3) satisfying x′ ∼ 2x1/2 and the angle θ between
the right-hand side and a vertical line satisfying 0 < θ < √2x−1/2.

Type 3 shape Right trapezoid T3 has a height h ∼ 1

2 x1/2 and a top edge of
length a (see subﬁgure (c) of Fig. 3) where a = ⌊x1/3⌋ is an exact integer.
The angle θ between the right-hand side and a vertical line satisﬁes 0 <
θ < √2x−1/2.

The proof of the following main result will be completed by an induction

based on eﬀective packings of these shapes.

Theorem 1. Keep the notations above. Then

Specially, when T1 is a square of side length x, then W (x) ≤ (12√2 + 34)x5/8.
Proof. (i) We partition Type 1 rectangle T1 into a rectangle S1 of size m1 ×
(x − m2), a rectangle S2 of size m2 × x′, and an integer-sided rectangle T ′1,
where m1, m2 ∼ m = x3/4, as shown in Figure 4. It is easy to see that T ′1 can
be perfectly packed, that is W (T ′1) = 0. Next, we pack S1 and S2 with stacks
of unit squares of height ⌈m1⌉ and ⌈m2⌉ respectively. Finally, only four regions
T2i, i = 1, 2, 3, 4 at each end of S1 and S2 unﬁlled that clearly are of Type 2
with height about m, a top edge of length m′ ∼ 2m1/2, and θ < √2m−1/2.

Ck, denoted by ck, is equal to ⌊x1/3⌋ − ⌊x1/3 − kx1/6⌋,k = 0,··· , t. Let dk is
the width of Dk, then dk = ⌊x1/3 − kx1/6⌋ + kh1 tan θ,k = 0,··· , t. Note that
when h1 > h, then the number of Dk is 0, the result still holds.

= x1/3 − kx1/6 − rk + kx−1/6 − βkx−1/3 + o(x−1/3)

dk
⌈dk⌉ = x1/3 − kx1/6 − rk + 1

(2)

we plan to pack Dk with rectangles of size 1 × ⌈dk⌉. We estimate αk more
accurately than before. Because of (1), we can obtain

⌈dk⌉ cos αk + sin αk = dk.

put (3) into (2), we can obtain

(x1/3 − kx1/6 − rk)(1− cos αk) = cos αk + sin αk − kx−1/6 + βkx−1/3 + o(x−1/3).

Applying Taylor’s formula of cos αk, sin αk,

4) Last, we will estimate W (F1), W (F2)(see aslo Figure 6). The height of
the rectangle F1 satisfy 0 ≤ h2 < min(h, h1), the width of it is f1, satisfying
f1 ∼ x1/3. When 0 ≤ h2 ≤ x1/3, we pack ⌊h2⌋× ⌊f1⌋ unit squares into F1, then
W (F1) < h2 + f1 < 2x1/3. When x1/3 < h2 ≤ h, we pack F1 with rectangles of
size 1 × ⌈f1⌉, F11, F12 are Type 2 trapezoid(see Figure 8). W (F11) + W (F12) =
O(x5/18), the total uncovered area of both ends of rectangles of size 1 × ⌈f1⌉
is less than h · √2x−1/6 ∼
√2
2 x1/3 < x1/3.
To sum up, W (F1) < 2x1/3. We estimate W (F2) in two cases, too. When
0 < θ < x−2/3, W (F2) < S(F2) < 1
8 x1/3. When x−2/3 ≤ θ <
√2x−1/2, W (F2) < S(F2) < 1

So, W (F ) ≤ W (F1) + W (F2) < 5

This completes the induction step. For x ≤ 100, W (T1) ≤ (1 + c)x. Because
of c ≤ 7, (1 + c)x3/8 < 48 < 11√2 + 34 < (11 + c)√2 + 34, W (T1) ≤ (1 + c)x <
((11 + c)√2 + 34)x5/8, the proof of the initial step of the induction is complete.
The proof of Theorem 1 is complete.

tan θ ′ , βk satisfy kr′ tan θ = βkx−1/3 +
o(x−1/3) and 0 ≤ βk < 1.

We cover Dk as follow. First, we leave Type 2 trapezoid Dt1 at the top of
Dt. Second, for k = t,··· , 2, we cover Dk with rectangles of size 1×⌈dk⌉, when
rectangles of size 1 × ⌈dk⌉ covered the bottom endpoint of right edge of Dk−1,
we cover Dk−1 with rectangles of size 1 × ⌈dk−1⌉, triangle Xk1 and trapezoid
Xk2, Xk3 between Dk−1 and Dk are shown as Figure 10, this is the case of
αk−1 ≥ αk, it is similar to the case of αk−1 < αk, the top edge of Xk2 is bk.
