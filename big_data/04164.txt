Abstract

We investigate the eﬀect of a small, gauge-invariant mass of the gluon on the anomalous chromo-

magnetic moment of quarks (ACM) by perturbative calculations at one loop level. The mass of the

gluon is taken to have been generated via a topological mass generation mechanism, in which the

gluon acquires a mass through its interaction with an antisymmetric tensor ﬁeld Bµν . For a small
gluon mass (< 10 MeV), we calculate the ACM at momentum transfer q2 = −M 2
those with the ACM calculated for the gluon mass arising from a Proca mass term. We ﬁnd that

Z . We compare

the ACM of up, down, strange and charm quarks vary signiﬁcantly with the gluon mass, while the

ACM of top and bottom quarks show negligible gluon mass dependence. The mechanism of gluon

mass generation is most important for the strange quarks ACM, but not so much for the other
quarks. We also show the results at q2 = −m2
q2 = −m2

t is much less than at q2 = −M 2

t . We ﬁnd that the dependence on gluon mass at

Z for all quarks.

INTRODUCTION

The anomalous chromomagnetic moment (ACM) of quarks does not yet have a precise

experimental bound. As the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) climbs new peaks of luminosity

and energy, it opens new windows on precision QCD [1], which should allow investigations

into the anomalous couplings such as the ACM [2].

The ACM of light quarks can be calculated in nonperturbative QCD [3–6]. However,

perturbative calculations of this quantity has received little attention so far, mainly be-

cause perturbative calculations in QCD do not make sense at very low energies. Since the

QCD coupling constant diminishes rapidly with increasing energy, precision measurements

are needed to measure the ACM at large momentum transfer. Although some bounds on

top quark ACM have been provided by early theoretical analyses using a general eﬀective

Lagrangian with an anomalous coupling [7–21], the only experimental analysis so far was

done by the CMS collaboration last year [22].

Another quantity not known very precisely, thus requiring more investigation, is the mass

of the gluon. Gluons are taken to be massless in QCD essentially because color symmetry is

unbroken as far as we know – there is no spontaneous symmetry breaking in QCD. However,

thus far experiments have failed to ﬁnd a stringent bound on the mass of the gluon [23].

Theoretical analyses regarding gluon mass have provided us with estimates varying over

a large range, from a few MeV to several hundred MeV [24–29]. However, if gluons are

indeed massive particles, all gluons must have the same mass, since one gluon cannot be

distinguished from another if the SU(3) global symmetry is unbroken. There are diﬀerent

ways for a gluon to be massive without symmetry breaking [24, 30, 31], the topological mass

generation mechanism [32–34, 36] is one of them.

In a previous paper [35], a small Proca mass was considered for the gluon, so that all

gluons had the same mass, and the anomalous chromomagnetic moment of each quark was

calculated perturbatively. However, those results can be relevant only if the gluon is massive

either via the Proca model, which is known to be unitary but non-renormalizable [30, 31],

or gets a dynamically generated mass, in which case the mass is likely to go to zero at

higher energies [24] where perturbation calculations make any sense. The other possibility

is to use the topological mass mechanism, which does not break the symmetry, thus giving

the same mass to all gluons, and may have the additional virtue of being unitary and

2

renormalizable [33, 34, 36].

In this paper we present a perturbative calculation of the

anomalous chromomagnetic moment of quarks, assuming a small, topologically generated,

gauge-invariant mass for the gluon.

The quark-gluon interaction term which corresponds to the anomalous chromomagnetic

moment is given by

ig ¯ψσµνT aψ F2(q2)qνGµa .

(1.1)

The coeﬃcient F2(q2) is the ACM of the quark at momentum transfer q. We will calculate

this term in perturbation theory at one loop, assuming a small mass for the gluon. Since

QCD is a strongly coupled theory at low energies, the ACM cannot be calculated perturba-

tively for q2 = 0, but only at suﬃciently large momentum transfer. We will give numerical
results for q2 = −M 2

Z as well as for q2 = −m2
t .

As mentioned above, a topological mass generation mechanism will be taken to be respon-

sible for the mass of the gluon. This mechanism involves an antisymmetric tensor ﬁeld Bµν
coupled to the ﬁeld strength Fµν of the gluon ﬁeld through a B ∧ F coupling. A Lagrangian
which implements this is

where Fµν is the ﬁeld strength tensor of the gluon ﬁeld Gµ, and Hµνλ = D[µBνλ] is the ﬁeld

strength of the antisymmetric tensor ﬁeld Ba

µν. The gluon mass M is a free parameter of

the theory.

This Lagrangian is invariant under local SU(3) gauge transformations

Gµ → UGµU −1 −

(1.5)

While the ﬁrst of these two terms ﬁxes the gauge for SU(3) transformations, the role of the

second term is somewhat more complicated. There is a higher gauge transformation for the
B ﬁeld, under Bµν → Bµν + D[µΛν] , which can be implemented in the Lagrangian by use of
an auxiliary ﬁeld [33, 34, 36]. This additional gauge transformation is ﬁxed by the second

3

term. We have not shown the auxiliary ﬁeld because its couplings do not appear in the

one-loop diagrams responsible for the ACM.

The propagators of the gluon and the tensor ﬁeld Bµν can now be calculated. Ignoring

the mixed quadratic term for the moment, we ﬁnd the propagators

The BF interaction term contains a quadratic derivative interaction between the two ﬁelds,

as well as a cubic interaction. The vertices for these interactions are shown in Fig. 1(a) and

There are of course other contributions to the ACM that we have to take into account. Let

us list all the relevant 1-loop diagrams. The ACM of quarks receives contributions from both

strong and weak processes at one loop order. Fig. 4 shows the diagrams corresponding to

strong and weak contributions. The new three-point vertices coming from topological mass

generation give rise to some more diagrams which contribute to the gluon ACM. These new

of the diagrams in Fig. 5 may be thought of as a correction to the diagram in Fig. 4(b). We

can calculate this conveniently by ﬁrst removing the quark lines from each of the diagrams

in Fig. 5 and then adding together the remaining parts. The resulting eﬀective topological

(1.13)

where all momenta are directed towards the vertex. This V abc is added to the usual three-

gluon vertex, and the total is used to calculate Fig. 4(b).

II. CALCULATIONS

We substitute ¯p = p − k , ¯q = −q and ¯r = k − p′ in the total eﬀective vertex given in
Eq. (1.13), and thus calculate the total contribution of all the diagrams in Fig. 5 to the

vertex function. We can write the total contribution of the ‘topological’ terms to the vertex

function as

The weak contributions to 4mF2 at scale MZ and at scale mt are shown for each quark

in Table I and Table II respectively. In both of these tables, any number which is smaller

by at least a factor of 10−3 than the largest number in the same row has been set to zero.

The factor of 4m is conventional, as the quantity 4mF2 is dimensionless. The total value of
4mF2(q2 = −M 2
we have also plotted the same quantity for each quark when the gluon mass is taken to

Z) for each quark is plotted against gluon mass in Fig. 6. For comparison,

come from a Proca term, as was calculated in [35]. These are shown as dotted lines in these

plots. Finally, in Fig. 7 we have plotted 4mF2 for each quark, at both the scales mt and

MZ, against topologically generated gluon mass.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

In this paper we have considered a speciﬁc model of gauge-invariant mass generation,

namely the topologically massive gauge theory, and calculated the anomalous chromomag-

netic moment F2(q2) , at the energy scale MZ as well as at mt . Looking at Fig. 6 we see

that gluon mass dependence of the ACM is the most prominent for the strange quark. As
the gluon mass is increased from 0 to 10 MeV, the dimensionless quantity 4mF2(q2 = −M 2
Z)
varies by more than 100% for the s-quark when the gluon mass is topologically generated.

z .

For a Proca mass term this variation is only about 42%. On the other hand, for the top

and bottom quarks the mass dependence of the ACM is negligible over this mass range,

irrespective of the mechanism responsible for mass generation (for the b quark the variation

is about 0.1%, for the t quark even less). Among the heavy quarks, the charm quark shows

approximately 0.5% variation, almost the same for both topological and Proca mass terms.

For the up and down quarks, the ACM varies by about 20 – 25% when the gluon mass is

varied over 0 – 10 MeV, and is higher for the topological mass term by about 2% at the top

11

of the range.

Next we take a look at Fig. 7. Here we have plotted the dimensionless quantity 4mF2

of quarks at two diﬀerent values of q2 for the same range of topologically generated gluon

mass. We have plotted 4mF2 at the scale mt as continuous lines, and 4mF2 at the scale MZ

as dotted lines, against gluon mass between 0 and 10 MeV. From these plots, we see that
Z than at q2 = −m2
the gluon mass dependence of 4mF2 is more pronounced at q2 = −M 2
for the light quarks like up, down and strange. For the top and bottom quarks, the gluon
mass dependence is negligible for both the energy scales q2 = −M 2
the actual values of the ACM are largely diﬀerent at the two energy scales.

What we can conclude from all this is that the ACM of the light quarks have signiﬁ-

cant, and possibly observable, dependence on gluon mass, irrespective of how the mass is

generated. As higher energies and luminosities become accessible to the LHC, precision

measurements of the anomalous chromomagnetic moments of quarks should become possi-

ble. While a measurement of the top quark ACM is unlikely to constrain the gluon mass,

data for other quarks will be able to put bounds on the mass of the gluon.

Not all terms of this expression will contribute to F2. Keeping only the relevant terms of

µ (k + (ζ2 + ζ3)p + (ζ4 + ζ5)p′)

(A9)

where the function in the numerator is

N (4)
µ (k) = − (/k − /p)(/k + m)(/k − /p′)(2k − p − p′)µ + 2(k − p)µ(/k − /p′)(/k + m)(/k − /p′)

− γλ(/k + m)γλ(2k − p − p′)µ + 2γµ(/k + m)(/k − /p)} .

(A10)

Changing variables from k to k + (ζ2 + ζ3)p + (ζ4 + ζ5)p′ , we can write the ﬁrst term in

Eq. (A10) as

− (/k + /a − /p)(/k + /a + m)(/k + /a − /p′){2k + (2ζ2 + 2ζ3 − 1)p + (2ζ3 + 2ζ4 − 1)p′}µ , (A11)
where we have deﬁned

aµ = (ζ2 + ζ3)pµ + (ζ3 + ζ4)p′

µ .

(A12)

As before, we ignore terms in Eq. (A11) which do not contribute to F2(q2). The relevant

terms can then be written as

−

mk2 (3(A + B) − 2) bµ + mk2(1 − A − B)aµ

+ (1 − A − B)mbµ(cid:2)(cid:0)(A + B)2 − 1(cid:1) m2 + (1 − AB)q2(cid:3) ,

where we have written

and

A = ζ2 + ζ3 ,

B = ζ4 + ζ5 ,

bµ = (2A − 1)pµ + (2B − 1)p′
µ .

The second and third terms in Eq. (A10), when added together, produce

2(/k − m)(k2 − m2)(2k − p − p′) .

(A13)

(A14)

(A15)

(A16)

After transforming from k to k + (ζ2 + ζ3)p + (ζ4 + ζ5)p′ , we can write the relevant terms in

Eq. (A16) as

−mk2aµ(1 − A − B) + mbµ[k2 ((A + B) − 2)

+ m2(1 − A − B)2(1 + A + B) + AB(1 − A − B)q2] .

(A17)

It is easy to see that the fourth and the last terms in Eq. (A10) do not contribute. The

relevant expression contributed by the ﬁfth term of Eq. (A10) are

[−2k2 − 2m2(1 − A − B)2 + (AB + (A − 1)(B − 1)) q2](A + B − 2)mbµ .

(A18)

Adding Eq. (A11), (A17) and (A18)and their forms obtained by interchanging dummy vari-
ables ζ2, ζ4 and ζ3, ζ5, we get from N (4)

µ (k) ,

(cid:2)−3(1 − A − B)mk2 − 2(1 − A − B)3(2 − A − B)m3

+(cid:0)(1 − A − B)3 + 2AB(1 − A − B)(2 − A − B)(cid:1) mq2(cid:3) (p + p′)µ .
