ABSTRACT

Element abundances in high-redshift quasar absorbers oﬀer excellent probes

of the chemical enrichment of distant galaxies, and can constrain models for

population III and early population II stars. Recent observations indicate that

the sub-damped Lyman-alpha (sub-DLA) absorbers are more metal-rich than the

damped Lyman-alpha (DLA) absorbers at redshifts 0<z<3. It has also been sug-

gested that the DLA metallicity drops suddenly at z>4.7. However, only 3 DLAs

at z>4.5 and no sub-DLAs at z>3.5 have “dust-free” metallicity measurements

of undepleted elements. We report the ﬁrst measurement of element abundances

in a sub-DLA at z=5.0, using Keck HIRES and ESI data. We obtain fairly robust

abundances of C, O, Si, and Fe, using lines outside the Lyman-alpha forest. We
ﬁnd this absorber to be metal-poor, with [O/H]=−2.02±0.12, which is >5σ below

the level expected from an extrapolation of the trend for z<3.5 sub-DLAs. The

C/O ratio is 1.7+0.4−0.3 times lower than in the Sun. More strikingly, Si/O is 3.0+0.6−0.5
times lower than in the Sun, while Si/Fe is nearly (1.3+0.4−0.3 times) solar. This

absorber does not display a clear alpha/Fe enhancement. Dust depletion may

have removed more Si from the gas phase than is common in the Milky Way in-

terstellar medium, which may be expected if high-redshift supernovae form more

silicate-rich dust. Furthermore, C/O and Si/O vary substantially between diﬀer-

ent velocity components, indicating spatial variations in dust depletion and/or

early stellar nucleosynethesis (e.g., population III star initial mass function). The

higher velocity gas may trace an outﬂow enriched by early stars.

Introduction

Understanding the production of the chemical elements in galaxies is vital to

understanding the evolution of galaxies. In fact, the cosmic odyssey of the elements is

fundamental to nearly all aspects of science, including the formation of planets and the

development of life. Indeed, planets have been detected around stars older than even 11

Gyr (Silva Aguirre et al. 2015). Understanding the early phases of metal production in the

universe is thus crucial for a number of reasons.

Especially interesting are the galaxies at redshifts z (cid:38) 5, an epoch spanning the ﬁrst
∼ 1.2 Gyr since the Big Bang. This epoch included the formation of the population III

stars and early generations of population II stars. Many recent theoretical studies have

investigated the formation of metals in these early stars (e.g., Maio & Iannuzzi 2011; Wise

et al. 2012; Maio & Tescari 2015). These studies predict that nucleosynthesis by the

early stars should give rise to rapid metallicity evolution and peculiar interstellar element
abundance patterns in galaxies at z (cid:38) 5. Supernova explosions of population III stars can

also contribute a signiﬁcant amount of dust production in young galaxies (e.g., Marassi et
al. 2015). Measuring the element abundances of galaxies at redshifts z (cid:38) 5 is, however,

very challenging, since observations of emission from these galaxies are diﬃcult.

Absorption lines in quasar spectra oﬀer a promising tool to measure abundances

in distant galaxies. The damped Lyman-alpha (DLA) and sub-damped Lyman-alpha

(sub-DLA) absorbers are especially important for this purpose. A primary reason for this

1Based on observations obtained at the W.M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a

scientiﬁc partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of Cali-

fornia and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made

possible by the generous ﬁnancial support of the W.M. Keck Foundation.

is that DLAs and sub-DLAs allow accurate measurements of the H I column densities

from the damping wings of the Lyman-alpha absorption lines. DLAs have H I column
densities NHI ≥ 2 × 1020 cm−2 and sub-DLAs have H I column densities in the range
1019 ≤ NHI < 2 × 1020 cm−2 (P´eroux et al. 2003). Given these large H I column densities,
DLAs and sub-DLAs dominate the H I content of the universe, and therefore play an

important role in the evolution of gas and stars in galaxies (e.g., Prochaska & Wolfe 2009;

Zafar et al. 2013; Popping et al. 2014).

The majority of past studies of element abundances in quasar absorbers focused on

DLAs, since owing to their large H I column densities, DLAs were expected to be the main

sites of star formation and metal production. It was thus surprising that recent studies

of sub-DLAs at z < 3 showed the sub-DLAs to be more metal-rich on average than the

DLAs (e.g., P´eroux et al. 2006; Meiring et al. 2007, 2009a,b; Prochaska et al. 2006; Som

et al. 2013, 2015; Quiret et al. 2016). Indeed, super-solar metallicity sub-DLAs are found

even at 2 < z < 3 (e.g., Som et al. 2013). The high metallicities are not an artifact of
ionization, since the ionization corrections for most sub-DLAs are relatively modest ((cid:46) 0.2

dex; e.g., Dessauges-Zavadsky et al. 2003; Meiring et al. 2007; Som et al. 2015). Thus,

sub-DLAs appear to have undergone metal enrichment earlier and may be associated with

more massive galaxies than DLAs (e.g., Kulkarni et al. 2010). This raises the question of

whether sub-DLAs were more metal-rich than DLAs even at higher redshifts, and whether

sub-DLAs with super-solar metallicities exist at even z > 4. At high enough redshifts, both

sub-DLAs and DLAs should be metal-poor, yet at z < 3, they clearly diﬀer in metallicity.

Thus, understanding when DLAs and sub-DLAs started diﬀerentiating chemically is of

great interest. Unfortunately, no reliable observations of sub-DLA metallicities exist at

z > 4.

In recent years, some DLAs at z > 4 have been observed (e.g., Rafelski et al. 2012,

– 5 –

2014). These studies suggest that the relatively gentle metallicity evolution of DLAs
observed at z < 3 holds back to z ∼ 4.5 (although some other studies disagree–see, e.g.,

Jorgenson et al. 2013). Furthermore, Rafelski et al. (2014) reported a sharp drop in the

DLA metallicity at z > 4.7. Such a drop, if real, could signal a sudden change in the

nucleosynthetic processes, perhaps indicative of an inﬂuence from population III stars or

early population II stars.

One complication in determining element abundances for DLAs and sub-DLAs is that

the refractory elements get depleted into interstellar dust grains, i.e., condense into the

solid phase. Elements such as Fe, Ni, Cr, and to a somewhat smaller extent, Si, are more

depleted, so it is more diﬃcult to determine metallicities from these elements. Reliable

determination of the total (gas + solid phase) metallicities requires observations of volatile

elements that do not show much depletion. The volatile elements most commonly used

for determining metallicities of DLAs / sub-DLAs are S and Zn. At z > 4, however,

the only available lines of Zn lie in the near-infrared, and thus are inaccessible to optical

spectrographs. Elements such as O and C can be used if their column densities can be

measured without problems of line saturation. Unfortunately, such dust-free measurements

exist for only 3 DLAs at z > 4.6. Likewise, only 2 sub-DLAs at z > 4 have O or S

measurements, of which neither is at z > 4.2. Furthermore, both of these measurements are

limits based on a single saturated line, rather than deﬁnitive values based on multiple lines.

In fact, none of the sub-DLAs at z > 3.5 have reliable O or S measurements.

Here, we report the ﬁrst measurements of element abundances in sub-DLAs in the
ﬁrst 1.2 Gyr, by targeting a sub-DLA at z ≈ 5 based on archival Keck observations of

the background quasar SDSSJ1202+3235. This paper is organized as follows: Section 2

describes the observations, data reduction, absorption line measurements, and column

density measurements. Section 3 discusses the results and compares the chemical

– 6 –

compositions and physical properties of the sub-DLA studied here with those of other

sub-DLAs and DLAs presented in the literature. Section 4 summarizes our main conclusions.

2. Observations and Data Reduction

The observations of the quasar SDSSJ120207.78+323538.8 (hereafter Q1202+3235,
zem = 5.2924 ± 0.001259) consisted of two exposures of 7200 s each obtained with Keck
HIRES on April 4, 2010 as part of the program UH018Hr (PI A. Wolfe) and two exposures

of 1800 s each obtained with Keck ESI on March 22, 2009 (program U143E, PI A. Wolfe).

The extracted, continuum-normalized, and combined HIRES spectra were downloaded from

the KODIAQ database (O’Meara et al. 2015), and the raw ESI spectra were downloaded

from the Keck Observatory Archive. The ESI spectra were reduced and extracted using

ESIRedux, an IDL-based reduction package written by J. X. Prochaska. The extracted ESI
spectra were split into smaller sections (typically ∼ 100 − 400 ˚A wide) around the lines of

interest, and these sections were continuum-ﬁtted using the IRAF “CONTINUUM” task.

To ﬁt the continuum in each section, we tried cubic spline polynomials typically of an order

between two and six, and used the function that provided the best ﬁt as judged from the

rms of the residuals. The continuum-normalized sections from the two ESI exposures were

combined for each wavelength range using the IRAF “SCOMBINE” task. In addition, the

continuum around a few of the lines measured with HIRES was reﬁt using second order

cubic spine polynomials in order to obtain a better continuum ﬁt in these regions.

2.1. Absorption Line Measurements and Column Density Determinations

A sub-DLA with z = 4.977 was identiﬁed in the SDSS spectra of Q1202+3235 by

Noterdaeme et al. (2012), who obtained log NHI = 20.02. Fig. 1 shows our Voigt proﬁle ﬁt

– 7 –

to the Keck HIRES data in the vicinity of the H I Lyman-alpha line in this absorber. The

left panel shows the Lyman-alpha line in the z = 4.977 absorber alone, while the right panel

shows the ﬁt to the entire region displayed, including Lyman-alpha lines at other nearby
redshifts. Our ﬁt gives log NHI = 19.86 ± 0.10. It is clear from the left panel of Fig. 1, that
this NHI value is fairly well-determined. Since the blends with the other Ly-α lines makes

the task of continuum determination challenging at these high redshifts, we make use of

the small stretches of continuum seen on both sides of the line in estimating the continuum

level.

Fig. 2 shows the velocity plots for the key low-ion metal lines. We emphasize that all

of these metal lines except O I λ 976 lie outside the Ly-α forest, and thus allow accurate

measurements of column densities. This fact is very important, since the primary reason
for the dearth of measurements of weakly depleted elements such as O in z (cid:38) 5 DLAs and

sub-DLAs is that their key absorption lines often lie within the Ly-α forest, which is very

dense at these high redshifts. For C II, only one line (λ 1334) is covered outside the Ly-α

forest. The C II λ 1036 line is strongly blended with the Ly-α forest lines, and therefore

not useful. While O I λ 1302 can often be saturated in lower redshift DLA/sub-DLAs,

it does not appear to be extremely saturated in the absorber of interest here. Moreover,

O I λ 976 is covered by the data. Even though the higher velocity components of O I λ

976 are blended with C III λ 977 and also the Lyman-α forest, the main component seen

in O I λ 1302 is also seen in O I λ 976; thus we can obtain reasonable column density

constraints by simultaneously ﬁtting both the O I lines. For Si II also, simultaneous ﬁtting

of two lines outside the Lyman-alpha forest (Si II λλ 1304, 1526) allows us obtain a robust

determination of the line parameters.

For Fe II, the only available line outside the Lyman-α forest is Fe II λ 1608, which is

marginally detected. The stronger Fe II lines at longer wavelengths (e.g. Fe II λ λ 2382,

– 8 –

2586, 2600 are not covered by the HIRES or ESI data at these high redshifts, while the Fe II

lines at shorter wavelengths (e.g., λ 1144) are strongly blended with the Lyman-α forest.

Fig. 3 shows the velocity plots for the available lines of C IV and Si IV, and our Voigt

proﬁle ﬁts for these. C IV λ 1548, 1551 lie outside the Lyman-α forest, but are not covered

by the HIRES data. We therefore use the ESI data for those. The Si IV λ 1394 line is

covered by the HIRES data. Si IV λ 1403 is not covered by the HIRES data, but is covered

by the ESI data. C III λ 977 could not be ﬁtted due to blending with Ly-α forest lines.

Si III λ 1206 could not be ﬁtted, since it is covered only in part, and is also heavily blended

with Lyman-α forest lines.

Column densities were determined by Voigt proﬁle ﬁtting using the program VPFIT2

version 10.0. The green curves plotted over the data in Fig. 1-3 show the Voigt proﬁle ﬁts

to the absorption lines. The total column densities were obtained by summing over all the

velocity components. These values were checked independently using the apparent optical

depth (AOD) method (Savage & Sembach 1991). For consistency with past studies (which

we use to compare to our results in section 4 below), we have adopted oscillator strengths

from Morton (2003). We note, however, that more recent oscillator strength determinations

exist for a few elements (e.g., Cashman et al. 2016 and references therein), and should be

uniformly applied to all future element abundance studies in DLA/sub-DLAs.

Table 1 presents the measurements of the metal column densities for the individual

velocity components for the low ions. Table 2 lists the column densities for the individual

velocity components for the higher ions C IV and Si IV. Table 3 gives the total column

densities for the available ions (summed over individual velocity components) derived from

the proﬁle ﬁts, along with the AOD estimates.

3. Discussion

3.1. Total Element Abundances

Table 4 lists the total element abundances for C, O, Si, and Fe calculated using

the total metal column densities along with the H I column density, and using the solar

abundances from Asplund et al. (2009). The second column of Table 4 lists the abundance

values based on the dominant ions (e.g., C II for C and Si II for Si), without including

ionization corrections. C appears to be modestly enriched with respect to O, with [C/O]No IC
= 0.31 ± 0.14. Surprisingly, C is not enhanced with respect to Si, which appears to be more
enriched than O, with [Si/O]No IC = 0.26 ± 0.12. Fe appears to be far less abundant, with
[C/Fe]No IC = 0.80 ± 0.17, [O/Fe]No IC = 0.49 ± 0.14, and [Si/Fe]No IC = 0.75 ± 0.15. We
next consider the eﬀect of ionization corrections using Cloudy photoionization models. As

we discuss below, the large apparent values of [Si/O]No IC, [C/Fe]No IC and [Si/Fe]No IC are

partly due to ionization eﬀects, since the ionization corrections are larger for C and Si than

for Fe, and are essentially negligible for O.

3.1.1.

Ionization Corrections

If the absorbing gas consists of both H I and H II regions, the ionized gas needs to

be taken into account while determining element abundances. For DLAs, these ionization

corrections are usually ignored, owing to their large H I column densities. But the ionization

corrections may not always be small for sub-DLAs, given their somewhat lower H I column

densities. Previous studies of ionization corrections in z < 3 sub-DLAs ﬁnd them to be

relatively modest (Dessauges-Zavadsky et al. 2003, Meiring et al. 2007, Battisti et al. 2012,

Som et al. 2015). To assess the ionization eﬀects in the sub-DLA toward Q1202+3235, we

used photoionization models using the plasma simulation code Cloudy v. 13.03 (Ferland et

– 10 –

al. 2013). First, the absorbing gas was assumed to be a slab of constant density, illuminated

by a radiation ﬁeld consisting of a mixture of an intergalactic UV background, the radiation

from O/B stars, the cosmic ray background and the cosmic microwave background at

zabs = 4.977. The UV background was adopted from Haardt & Madau (1996) and Madau et

al. (1999) and evaluated at zabs = 4.977. The O/B stellar radiation was based on a Kurucz

model spectrum for a temperature T = 30, 000 K.

The observed Si IV/ Si II and C IV/ C II ratios were used to constrain the ionization

parameter U = nγ/nH, i.e. the ratio of the number density of ionizing photons to that of
the gas. To do this, grids of models were constructed for −6.3 < log U < −0.3, followed by
ﬁner grids in the range −4 < log U < −1, calculating the predicted column density ratios

Si IV/ Si II and C IV/ C II (top panels of Fig. 4 and 5, respectively). The results from
both these ratios were fairly similar. The Si IV/ Si II constraint gave log U = −2.22, while
the C IV/ C II constraint gave log U = −2.41. The resultant ionization corrections ( =

[Xtotal/Htotal] - [Xdominant ion/ H I]) are also fairly similar. Given that the Si II and Si IV

column densities are better determined, we adopt the ionization parameter determined from

Si IV/Si II; this implies ionization corrections of -0.33 dex for C, -0.001 dex for O, -0.36 dex

for Si, and -0.07 dex for Fe. The corresponding ionization corrections from the C IV/ C II

constraint agree with the above values within < 0.05 dex.

We next carried out Cloudy calculations without assuming a constant density, but

letting the density and radiation ﬁeld intensity to be varied simultaneously using the

“optimization” option. This approach gave a higher ionization parameter log U = -1.42, and

fairly similar ionization corrections for O, Si, Fe, i.e.,  = -0.008, -0.34, -0.09, respectively,
and a somewhat diﬀerent value for C, i.e.,  = −0.43.

Columns 3, 4 and 5, 6 in Table 4 give, respectively, the abundances [X/H] and [X/O]

derived using the above two sets of ionization correction estimates (“IC1” and “IC2”,

– 11 –

respectively). Both determinations of the ionization corrections for O are essentially

negligible (< 0.01 dex). This is, of course, expected, since the ionization potential of O

I is very close to that of H I. We therefore regard the O abundance as the most reliable

indicator of metallicity in this system. For the remaining elements, we adopt the second set

of ionization corrections (“IC2”, calculated with the optimization technique).

3.2. Relative Abundances

3.2.1. Overall Abundance Pattern

Several peculiarities are seen in the overall relative abundances. Relative to the solar
ratio, C and Fe are underabundant compared to O by 0.22 ± 0.09 dex and 0.57 ± 0.14 dex.
In other words, the C/O ratio is lower than in the Sun by a factor of 1.66+0.38−0.31, while the
Fe/O ratio is lower than in the Sun by a factor of 3.72+1.41−1.02.

The most striking feature of the overall abundance pattern is that Si is signiﬁcantly
under-abundant relative to O, with [Si/O] of −0.47 ± 0.08. In fact Si is barely enhanced
with respect to Fe, with [Si/Fe] = 0.10 ± 0.12. Thus this absorber does not show a clear

evidence of alpha-enrichment. This suggests that the nucleosynthetic history in this z = 5

absorber was peculiar, and/or that Si is more preferentially depleted on to dust grains (see

sections 3.3 and 4 for more discussion of these points).

We also note that the observed column densities would, at face value, suggest a

signiﬁcant C enhancement relative to Fe, [C/Fe] = 0.70. However, some of this excess is due

to ionization eﬀects. The ionization-corrected value is [C/Fe] = 0.36. Thus, this absorber

does not show the strong C/Fe enhancement seen in some very metal-poor (VMP) DLAs

observed at lower redshifts (e.g. Cooke et al. 2015) or in the C-enhanced metal-poor stars

(e.g., Aoki et al. 2007).

– 12 –

How does this absorber compare to the handful of DLAs studied at z ∼ 5.0? Rafelski

et al. (2014) reported measurements of Si and Fe in two DLAs at zabs > 4.9.
[Si/Fe] in
these two systems are > −0.11 and 0.42. The [Si/Fe] in the sub-DLA reported here lies in

between these values. Neither of these DLAs from Rafelski et al. (2014) have reports of O

abundances, so it is not possible to compare the substantially negative value of [Fe/O] =
−0.57 ± 0.14 in our sub-DLA with that in other z ∼ 5.0 absorbers.

To help put this chemically poor z = 5 sub-DLA in context, we also compare its

relative abundances to those in the VMP DLAs at 2 < z < 4.5 (e.g., Cooke et al. 2011).
The [Fe/O] value of −0.57 ± 0.14 in our z = 5 absorber is somewhat low compared to
the typical value of −0.39 ± 0.12 for the VMP DLAs. The [C/O] value of −0.22 ± 0.09 is
comparable to the typical value of −0.28 ± 0.12 for VMP DLAs , while the [Si/O] value of
−0.47 ± 0.08 is much lower than the typical value of −0.08 ± 0.10 for VMP DLAs (Cooke

et al. 2011). Thus the z = 5 absorber studied here appears to have had a distinct metal

and/or dust production history than the lower redshift VMP DLAs.

3.2.2. Variations in Relative Abundances

The bulk of the O I absorption in this absorber is limited to a much narrower velocity

range, while the Si II and C II absorption is spread more uniformly. There thus appears

to be a substantial diﬀerence between the relative C, O, and Si abundances between the

diﬀerent components. The logarithmic ratios of the observed column densities for C II
and O I, relative to the solar C/ O ratio, are −0.33 ± 0.12 dex and 1.03 ± 0.12 dex in the

z = 4.977004 and z = 4.978517 components, respectively. The logarithmic ratios Si II/ O I,
relative to the solar Si/O ratio, are −0.43 ± 0.09 dex and 1.08 ± 0.11 dex, respectively, in

the z = 4.977004 and z = 4.978517 components. In other words, the observed C II/ O I

and Si II/ O I ratios in these two velocity components diﬀer by factors of about 23 and 32,

– 13 –

respectively.

We cannot accurately estimate ionization corrections for these individual components

seen in the low ions due to the diﬀerent velocity structures of the low and high ions.

However, based on the overall ionization corrections (Table 4), it is clear that the large

diﬀerences between the C II/ O I and Si II/ O I ratios between these components originate

at least in part in actual abundance diﬀerences. The overall under-abundance of C and

Si relative to O mentioned in section 3.2.1 (obtained after summing over all velocity

components) seems to be arising primarily in the main component at z = 4.977004. By
contrast, the weaker component at z = 4.978517 (which is at a velocity of ∼76 km s−1

relative to the main component) appears to have an enhancement of C and Si relative to

O. It is possible that this higher-velocity gas traces an outﬂow enriched by early stars. The

main component, deﬁcient in C and Si relative to O, may be enriched by a diﬀerent stellar

population and may trace cooler gas with higher dust depletion. Such abundance diﬀerences

may be further aided by ionization diﬀerences to produce the observed large diﬀerences in

the C II/ O I and Si II/ O I ratios, if the outﬂowing higher velocity component gas is also

more ionized (and hence more deﬁcient in O I) than the main component.

3.3. Metallicity Evolution

Fig. 6 compares the metallicity of the z = 5 sub-DLA toward Q1202+3235 with the

metallicity-redshift relations for sub-DLAs and DLAs for lower redshifts. The unﬁlled

squares show the binned NHI-weighted mean metallicity vs. median redshift, inferred from

elements Zn, S, or O, that do not deplete much on interstellar dust grains, for the z < 3.5

sub-DLAs from Som et al. (2015), Prochaska et al. (2015) and references therein. We

have excluded absorbers along BAL sightlines and those from metallicity-selected studies

(e.g., Prochaska et al. 2006). Most of the measurements consist of S or Zn, since reliable

– 14 –

measurements of O abundance based on multiple lines are available for very few systems.

(Usually, O I λ 1302 is the only line available, and is saturated.) The unﬁlled circles show

the binned NHI-weighted mean metallicity vs. median redshift for DLAs at z < 4.5. The

dashed lines indicate the linear regression ﬁts to the binned trends for the DLAs and

sub-DLAs. The ﬁlled circles show the individual DLAs at z > 4.5 with S measurements

from Rafelski et al. (2014). The ﬁlled square shows the O measurement for the sub-DLA at

z = 5 from this paper. The black curves show the predictions from early chemical evolution

models. The solid curve shows the mean gas metallicity from Maio & Tescari (2015). The

dashed and dot-dashed black curves show the hydrodynamic simulations of Maio & Iannuzzi

(2011) and the semi-analytic model of Kulkarni et al. (2013).

A few things are striking about these comparisons:

(1) The z = 5 sub-DLA lies > 5σ below the extrapolation from the lower redshift

sub-DLAs. In fact, this sub-DLA lies ∼ 3σ below even the level expected at z = 5 from the

trend for z < 4.5 DLAs. Given that this sub-DLA was randomly selected based on only its

high redshift, it appears that at these early epochs, sub-DLA abundances were low. This,

together with the > 10 times higher mean metallicity of sub-DLAs at z < 3.5, suggests that
most sub-DLAs built up in metallicity rather rapidly during the ∼ 0.6 Gyr between z = 5

and z = 3.5. Of course, measurements of S and O abundances are needed for many more

z > 3.5 sub-DLAs to verify if they are also metal-poor and if so, to determine how rapid

the metallicity rise was.

(2) The z = 5 sub-DLA appears to agree well with the Maio & Iannuzzi (2011) and

Maio & Tescari (2015) models, but not with the Kulkarni et al. (2013) model. Future

observations of more sub-DLAs and DLAs at similar redshifts can potentially help to

discern more deﬁnitively between diﬀerent models.

(3) We also note that the z > 4.5 DLAs appear to be consistent with the extrapolation

– 15 –

from the lower redshift DLAs. This contrasts with the sudden drop of metallicity at z > 4.7

claimed by Rafelski et al. (2014). This diﬀerence stems from the fact that we have focused

only on S and O measurements, while most of the measurements of Rafelski et al. (2014)

were for Si and Fe, elements that are known to be depleted on dust grains in the Milky Way.

It is therefore important to track down whether the diﬀerence is a result of dust depletion

of Si and Fe. We stress that dust depletion cannot be ignored, given the evidence for dust
at high redshift (e.g., from z ∼ 5 sub-mm galaxies, Coppin et al. 2009, Walter et al. 2012,

Casey et al. 2014). Furthermore, the supernova explosions of early stars are more likely to

produce silicate dust. For example, Marassi et al. (2015) ﬁnd that standard core-collapse

population III supernovae can produce dust eﬃciently, in the range of 0.2-3 M(cid:12), and that

this dust is predominantly silicate. Given such eﬃcient production of silicate dust, the gas

in high-redshift galaxies could show stronger depletion of Si than in the Milky Way. Thus

the sudden metaliicity drop claimed at z > 4.7 could be due to higher depletion levels.

3.4. Dust Depletion

A comparison of the abundances of refractory and volatile elements oﬀers a tool

to estimate the extent of dust depletion. Jenkins (2009) proposed a method based on

multiple elements for assessing the extent of dust depletion and the determination of true

(undepleted) abundances. We now attempt to determine the level of dust depletion in the

z = 5 sub-DLA toward Q1202+3235 applying the prescription of Jenkins (2009) to element

abundances available from our data, as described in a study of absorbers from the ESO

UVES advanced data products quasar sample (Quiret et al. 2016).

Fig. 7 shows a plot of the quantity [X/H]IC2− BX + AXzX vs. AX for the four
elements available for this absorber. Here [X/H]IC2 are the abundance measurements

corrected for ionization using the optimization technique (from column 4 of Table 4). The

– 16 –

parameters AX, BX, and zX are adopted from Table 4 of Jenkins (2009). The dotted line

shows the Buckley-James regression ﬁt to the data. The y-intercept of this line gives

the intrinsic (undepleted) metallicity, while its slope is the depletion factor F∗. Using
a bootstrap technique with 1000 iterations, we obtain [X/H]intrinsic = −2.16 ± 0.16 and
F∗ = −0.13 ± 0.17. The intrinsic metallicity thus inferred (−2.16 ± 0.16) is consistent with
the metallicity we obtain from O (−2.02 ± 0.12). The F∗ value is a little higher than the
average value of −0.34 ± 0.19 for the larger sub-DLA sample from Quiret et al. (2016).

This suggests that the sub-DLA at z = 5 toward Q1202+3235 may be somewhat more

dusty than the typical lower redshift sub-DLAs, perhaps further supporting the possibility

that the depletion levels may be higher at z = 5. For reference, representative F∗ values are

-0.1 for the warm ionized interstellar medium (ISM) of the Milky Way, 0.1 for the warm

neutral medium, and 0.4 for the cold neutral medium (Draine 2011). The z = 5 sub-DLA

toward Q1202+3235 may be more similar to the warm ionized ISM, which is not entirely

surprising. (We point out that Quiret et al. 2016 ﬁnd the typical F∗ value for DLAs to be
even more negative −0.70 ± 0.06, again suggesting warm ionized gas and lower dust content
compared to the Milky Way ISM.) It would be interesting to obtain F∗ values for the high-z

DLAs as well. More detections of undepleted elements in high-z DLAs are needed for this

purpose, since none of the high-z DLAs observed so far have enough such detections to

permit determination of F∗.

3.5. Gas Kinematics

Another important indicator of the absorber properties can be obtained from the

velocity structure of the absorption lines. A correlation between the gas velocity dispersion

and metallicity has been observed for both DLAs and sub-DLAs (e.g., Ledoux et al.

2006; Meiring et al. 2007; Som et al. 2015). If the velocity dispersion is determined

– 17 –

primarily by the mass of the host galaxy, the velocity-metallicity correlation may indicate a

mass-metallicity relation. Alternately, the velocity dispersion may be determined primarily

by turbulent motions, outﬂows, or inﬂows of gas.

The velocity-metallicity relation appears to be diﬀerent for DLAs and sub-DLAs

(Som et al. 2015). It is therefore interesting to compare the gas kinematics of the z = 5

sub-DLA studied here with that for other sub-DLAs and for DLAs. The velocity width

∆v90 is determined as the velocity range within which 90% of the integrated optical depth

is contained. The top two panels of Fig. 8 show the measurements of ∆v90 for Si II λ 1526

and O I λ 1302, based on our observations. Despite the diﬀerence in the strengths of the

lines, the velocity dispersions inferred from their observations are quite similar, i.e., 88.42
km s−1 for Si II λ 1526 and 85.81 km s−1 for O I λ 1302. Quiret et al. (2016) recently

advocated using the theoretical Voigt proﬁle ﬁt without convolution with the instrumental

proﬁle instead of the actual data for calculating ∆v90. The idea is to reduce the sensitivity

of the measurement to instrumental resolution and to the presence of noise or saturation in

the data. This latter approach, illustrated in the bottom two panels of Fig. 8, gives ∆v90
of 84.49 and 74.04 km s−1, respectively, for the Si II λ 1526 and O I λ 1302 lines. Since

the Si II λ 1526 line is less saturated, we adopt its ∆v90 as the velocity dispersion for this

system.

Given this velocity dispersion, this absorber lies far below the metallicity-velocity

relation observed for lower redshift sub-DLAs. For example, Som et al. (2015) obtain
[X/H] = (0.89 ± 0.08) log ∆ v90 − (1.90 ± 0.16) for lower redshift sub-DLAs. As per this
relation, one would expect the z = 5 sub-DLA toward Q1202+3235 to have a metallicity
of −0.19 ± 0.22 dex, far above the observed value of −2.02 ± 0.12 dex. For DLAs, Som
et al. (2015) estimate [X H] = (1.02 ± 0.03) log ∆ v90 − (3.10 ± 0.06). Even as per this
relation, an absorber with a velocity dispersion of 84.49 km s−1 would be expected to have

– 18 –

a metallicity of -1.13 ±0.08 dex. The absorber toward Q1202+3235 thus appears to lie

closer to the velocity-metallicity relation for DLAs than that for sub-DLAs, and in fact, lies

substantially below even the DLA relation. We do note again, however, that the bulk of

the O I absorption in this absorber is limited to a much narrower velocity range. The Si II

and C II absorption is spread more uniformly. This diﬀerence may arise from a diﬀerence

in abundances and/or ionization in the higher velocity, possibly outﬂowing gas.

We also note that the velocity dispersion of the Si II gas in this absorber is much

larger than the velocity dispersion measured for the very metal-poor DLAs by Cooke et al.

2015 (even after accounting for their use of the innermost 68 % rather than the innermost

90 % of the optical depth to deﬁne the velocity dispersion). Cooke et al. (2015) have

suggested that the very metal-poor DLAs arise in galaxies with low halo masses. It appears

that the z = 5 sub-DLA studied here may be larger in halo mass. On the other hand, if

the higher velocity component represents outﬂowing gas, and the velocity dispersion of the

main absorber is in fact smaller, the implied halo mass could be smaller.

4. Summary and Outlook for Future Work

We have studied the chemical composition and kinematics of a sub-DLA at z = 5,

providing the ﬁrst reliable measurement of element abundances in a sub-DLA at z > 3.5.
This absorber is substantially metal-poor ([O/H]= −2.02 ± 0.12), > 5σ lower than the

expectations from the z < 3.5 sub-DLAs. It has unusual relative abundance patterns, e.g.,

an overall under-abundance, relative to the solar ratio, of Si and C compared to O by
factors of ∼3.0 and ∼1.7, respectively. The relative abundance pattern is also distinct from

the typical pattern seen in the VMP DLAs. Furthermore, there appears to be a substantial

variation in the C/O and Si/O ratios between diﬀerent velocity components. Indeed, the
component oﬀset by ∼ 76 km s−1 from the dominant component appears to have signiﬁcant

– 19 –

enhancement of C and Si relative to O. It is possible that this higher-velocity gas traces

an outﬂow enriched by early stars. The main component, deﬁcient in C and Si relative to

O, may be enriched by a diﬀerent stellar population, or may be reﬂecting a higher level
of dust depletion. With a gas velocity dispersion of ∼84 km s−1, this absorber lies closer

to the velocity-metallicity trend observed for DLAs than that for sub-DLAs, and in fact

lies substantially below even the DLA relation. The possibility of higher Si depletion in

this z = 5 absorber also suggests that the sudden metaliicity drop reported in the DLA

metallicity at z > 4.7 could perhaps be caused in part by higher dust depletion levels. In

any case, the low [Si/O] ratio in this absorber underscores the need to obtain measurements

of undepleted or weakly depleted elements such as O in other DLAs and sub-DLAs at these

high redshifts.

The low metallicity of this z = 5 absorber, if conﬁrmed by studies of other sub-DLAs at

similar redshifts, would suggest that the bulk of sub-DLA enrichment occurred during the
relatively short time period of ∼0.6 Gyr between z = 5 and z = 3.5. The metal-poor nature

of this absorber and its location in the velocity-metallicity plane also suggest that the DLA

and sub-DLA absorber populations may have been more similar at high redshifts. Indeed,

an absorber that is a sub-DLA at low redshift could have been a DLA at high redshift. For

example, if a subset of DLAs experienced more rapid star formation (and hence neutral

gas consumption) compared to the remaining DLA population, they could later manifest

themselves as the less gas-rich, but more metal-enriched sub-DLAs. A systematic study

of undepleted elements in more high-z DLAs and sub-DLAs is essential to understand

whether the two populations were indeed similar in the past, and when they started

diﬀerentiating from each other. It would be fascinating to examine, for example, whether

this diﬀerentiation was linked to the emergence of the dichotomy between early-type and

late-type galaxies.

– 20 –

The evolution of interstellar element abundances is governed by the history of star

formation and the distribution of these elements in interstellar space. The cosmic star
formation history has been measured out to z ∼ 10 (e.g., Bouwens et al. 2015 and references

therein). It will therefore be very interesting to examine how the metal evolution implied

by this cosmic star formation history compares with the observations of high-z DLAs and

sub-DLAs.

The relative abundances of elements in high-z DLAs and sub-DLAs will also oﬀer

excellent constraints on metal and dust production by population III and early population

II stars. For example, it will be interesting to examine whether the low [Si/O] seen in

the z = 5 absorber toward Q1202+3235 was common at that epoch. Population III

nucleosynthesis models predict substantial diﬀerences between relative abundances such

as [Si/O] at high redshifts for diﬀerent population III initial mass functions (IMFs) and

diﬀerent halo masses. [Si/O] is more constraining than [C/Fe] because the Si yield varies

more with the IMF, due to the eﬃciency of Si production in massive stars as a result of

O burning. For example, Kulkarni et al. (2013) predict a substantial under-abundance of

Si relative to O at z = 6 for a population III IMF extending over 35-100 M(cid:12) stellar mass

range. For that IMF, a [Si/O] ratio comparable to that seen in the sub-DLA studied here
would be expected for a ∼ 108.5 M(cid:12) halo at z = 6. On the other hand, Kulkarni et al.
(2013) predict a substantial overabundance of Si relative to O for a population III IMF

extending over the 100-260 M(cid:12) range. The diﬀerences seen in the Si/O ratios between the

velocity components of the z = 5 sub-DLA toward Q1202+3235 thus could be indicative of

spatial variations in the population III IMF. Any insights obtained into the population III

IMF from more relative abundance studies in high-z DLAs and sub-DLAs would also help

to quantify the role played by population III stars in the reionization of the intergalactic

medium. Future observations of DLAs and sub-DLAs at z > 5 will thus provide many

crucial insights into the ﬁrst 1 Gyr of galaxy evolution.

1Abundance estimates based on the dominant metal ionization states and H I, with no ionization correction.

2Estimates including ionization corrections estimated in two diﬀerent ways. See the text for deﬁnitions of

IC1 and IC2. Uncertainties in ionization-corrected abundances include measurement uncertainties in the

relevant column densities, but not in the ionization correction estimates.
