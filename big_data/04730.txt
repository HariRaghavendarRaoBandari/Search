ABSTRACT

Based on optical imaging and spectroscopy of the Type II-Plateau SN 2013eq, we present a comparative study of commonly used
distance determination methods based on Type II supernovae. The occurrence of SN 2013eq in the Hubble ﬂow ( z = 0.041 ± 0.001)
prompted us to investigate the implications of the diﬀerence between “angular” and “luminosity” distances within the framework of
the expanding photosphere method (EPM) that relies upon a relation between ﬂux and angular size to yield a distance. Following a
re-derivation of the basic equations of the EPM for SNe at non-negligible redshifts, we conclude that the EPM results in an angular
distance. The observed ﬂux should be converted into the SN rest frame and the angular size, θ, has to be corrected by a factor of
(1 + z)2. Alternatively, the EPM angular distance can be converted to a luminosity distance by implementing a modiﬁcation of the
angular size. For SN 2013eq, we ﬁnd EPM luminosity distances of DL = 151 ± 18 Mpc and DL = 164 ± 20 Mpc by making use of
diﬀerent sets of dilution factors taken from the literature. Application of the standardized candle method for Type II-P SNe results in
an independent luminosity distance estimate (DL = 168 ± 16 Mpc) that is consistent with the EPM estimate.

1. Introduction

Supernovae have proven to be useful as distance indicators and
are pivotal to estimating fundamental cosmological parameters
such as the expansion rate, geometry, age, and energy content
of the Universe. Observations using thermonuclear (Type Ia) su-
pernovae (SNe) led to the surprising conclusion that the Uni-
verse was expanding at an accelerating rate (Riess et al. 1998;
Perlmutter et al. 1999; Leibundgut 2001; Goobar & Leibundgut
2011).

Although the use of SNe Ia is very well established, it is also
possible to use core-collapse SNe (Hamuy & Pinto 2002). In
particular, two methods for distance determinations – using Type
II-Plateau (P) SNe – have received the most attention. The ﬁrst
is the so-called “expanding photosphere method” (EPM) that
was developed by Kirshner & Kwan (1974) based on a sugges-
tion by Leonard Searle, who suggested that the Baade-Wesselink
method (Baade 1926; Wesselink 1946), used to determine the
radii of pulsating stars, could be adapted to estimate distances to
SNe. This could be done by linking the photospheric expansion
to the observed expansion velocities. Thus the EPM is essentially
a geometrical technique relying on the comparison between the
angular size of an object and its observed ﬂux. Over the past 40
years a variety of improvements have been suggested e.g. the

⋆ E-mail: egall01@qub.ac.uk

introduction of distance correction factors to adjust for dilution
eﬀects in scattering atmospheres, detailed modelling of SN at-
mospheres, and cross-correlation techniques to measure line ve-
locities (e.g. Wagoner 1981; Eastman et al. 1996; Hamuy et al.
2001; Dessart & Hillier 2005). A somewhat diﬀerent, though re-
lated form, is the spectral-ﬁtting expanding atmosphere method
(SEAM; Baron et al. 2004), in which model ﬁts to the SN spec-
tra are used to determine key variables.

The other commonly used method for distance determina-
tion using SNe II-P is the “standardized candle method” (SCM;
Hamuy & Pinto 2002). It rests on the expectation that a more en-
ergetic, and consequently more luminous explosion will produce
ejecta having a higher kinetic energy. This results in a correla-
tion between the bolometric luminosity and the expansion ve-
locities during the plateau phase, allowing for a normalization
of the SN luminosity, yielding a distance estimate. A number of
groups have further built upon the SCM, for example by sim-
plifying extinction corrections, or exploring alternatives to the
commonly employed iron lines to measure the ejecta velocities
(e.g. Nugent et al. 2006; Poznanski et al. 2009).

Even though Type II-P SNe are intrinsically fainter than SNe
Ia and thus more challenging to observe at large distances, they
occur more frequently per unit volume, allowing the possibil-
ity of building statistically signiﬁcant samples. Moreover, the
EPM has the striking virtue that it is independent from local

calibrations – albeit at the cost of requiring multi-epoch spec-
troscopy alongside photometric observations. The SCM, in com-
parison, is less observationally expensive requiring mainly data
around the midpoint of the plateau phase, but akin to the SN Ia
distance determinations, it does rely on local distance anchors.
Nevertheless, both methods oﬀer alternative distance estimates,
and more importantly, are aﬀected by diﬀerent systematic eﬀects
compared to the SNe Ia.

In order to create a EPM/SCM Hubble diagram based on
Type II-P SNe, distance measurements at and beyond the Hub-
ble ﬂow are essential. Galaxies in the local neighbourhood are
aﬀected by peculiar motions that can be diﬃcult to model and
therefore limit the precision with which cosmological redshifts
can be measured.

Barring a few exceptions, applications of the EPM or its vari-
ations have remained conﬁned to SNe within the local Universe
(e.g., Hamuy et al. 2001; Leonard 2002; Elmhamdi et al. 2003;
Dhungana et al. 2015). To our best knowledge the EPM has only
been adopted for SNe with redshifts z > 0.01 by Schmidt et al.
(1994) who performed the EPM on SN 1992am at z ∼ 0.049,
Eastman et al. (1996) who also included SN 1992am in their
sample and Jones et al. (2009) whose sample encompassed SNe
with redshifts up to z = 0.028. Schmidt et al. (1994) were the
ﬁrst to investigate the implications of applying the EPM at higher
redshifts.

On the other hand, probably due to the relative ease of ob-
taining the minimum requisite data, the SCM is much more
commonly applied to SNe at all redshifts 0.01 < z < 0.1 (e.g.
Hamuy & Pinto 2002; Maguire et al. 2010; Polshaw et al. 2015)
and even to SNe IIP at redshifts z > 0.1 (Nugent et al. 2006;
Poznanski et al. 2009; D’Andrea et al. 2010).

Motivated by the discovery of SN 2013eq at a redshift of z =
0.041 ± 0.001 we undertook an analysis of the relativistic eﬀects
that occur when applying the EPM to SNe at non-negligible red-
shifts. As a result, we expand on earlier work by Schmidt et al.
(1994), who ﬁrst investigated the implications of high redshift
EPM. We wish to ensure that the diﬀerence between angular dis-
tance and luminosity distance – that becomes signiﬁcant when
moving to higher redshifts – is well understood within the frame-
work of the EPM.

This paper is structured as follows: observations of SN
2013eq are presented in §2; we summarize the EPM and SCM
methods in §3; our results are discussed in §4.

2. Observations and data reduction

SN 2013eq was discovered on 2013 July 30 (Mikuz et al. 2013)
and spectroscopically classiﬁed as a Type II SN using spectra ob-
tained on 2013 July 31 and August 1 (Mikuz et al. 2013). These
exhibit a blue continuum with characteristic P-Cygni line pro-
ﬁles of Hα and Hβ, indicating that SN 2013eq was discovered
very young, even though the closest pre-discovery non-detection
was on 2013 June 19, more than 1 month before its discovery
(Mikuz et al. 2013). Mikuz et al. (2013) adopt a redshift of 0.042
for SN 2013eq from the host galaxy. We obtained 5 spectra rang-
ing from 7 to 65 days after discovery (rest frame) and photome-
try up to 76 days after discovery (rest frame).

location of the supernova at αJ2000 = 17h33m15s.73, δJ2000 =

stars (see also Table A.1) used for the photometric calibrations.

covery (rest frame).

data were reduced in the standard fashion using the LT pipelines,
including trimming, bias subtraction, and ﬂat-ﬁelding.

Point-spread function (PSF) ﬁtting photometry of SN
2013eq was carried out on all images using the custom built
SNOoPY1 package within iraf2. Photometric zero points and
colour terms were derived using observations of Landolt stan-
dard star ﬁelds (Landolt 1992) in the 3 photometric nights and
their averaged values where then used to calibrate the magni-
tudes of a set of local sequence stars as shown in Table A.1 in the
appendix and Figure 1 that were in turn used to calibrate the pho-
tometry of the SN in the remainder of nights. We estimated the
uncertainties of the PSF-ﬁtting via artiﬁcial star experiments. An
artiﬁcial star of the same magnitude as the SN was placed close
to the position of the SN. The magnitude was measured, and the
process was repeated for several positions around the SN. The
standard deviation of the magnitudes of the artiﬁcial star were
combined in quadrature with the uncertainty of the PSF-ﬁt and
the uncertainty of the photometric zeropoint to give the ﬁnal un-
certainty of the magnitude of the SN.

A series of ﬁve optical spectra were obtained with the Optical
System for Imaging and low-Intermediate-Resolution Integrated
Spectroscopy (OSIRIS, grating ID R300B) mounted on the Gran
Telescopio CANARIAS (GTC) and the Intermediate dispersion
Spectrograph and Imaging System (ISIS, grating IDs R158R and
R300B) mounted on the William Herschel Telescope (WHT).

The spectra were reduced using iraf following standard
procedures. These included trimming, bias subtraction, ﬂat-
ﬁelding, optimal extraction, wavelength calibration via arc
lamps, ﬂux calibration via spectrophotometric standard stars,
and re-calibration of the spectral ﬂuxes to match the photome-

try. The spectra were also corrected for telluric absorption using
a model spectrum of the telluric bands.

Weak Na i D absorption, with an equivalent width of EWNa I D
= 0.547 ± 0.072 Å, can be detected in the +25 d spectrum of SN
2013eq. Applying the empirical relation between Na i D absorp-
tion and dust extinction given in Poznanski et al. (2012, Equa-
tion 9), this translates into an extinction within the host galaxy
of E(B −V)host = 0.062 ± 0.028 mag. Even though the EW Na i D
absorption is a commonly used diagnostic of extinction, as has
been noted on numerous occasions, it is not always reliable (e.g
Poznanski et al. 2012). Given the remote location of SN 2013eq
(projected distance of ∼ 14.6 kpc from the host galaxy nucleus3),
the host extinction deduced above is likely to be an upper limit.
Although one expects the local environments of core-collapse
SNe to be diﬀerent from those of SNe Ia, there is some indication
for a positive correlation between AV and the radial position of
the SN within the host galaxy (e.g. Holwerda et al. 2015). For the
Galactic extinction we adopt a value of E(B − V)Gal = 0.034 mag
(Schlaﬂy & Finkbeiner 2011).

The Na i D absorption lends itself to an estimate of the red-
shift. Applying equation 12 in Leonard et al. (2002, using the
values for the rest wavelengths and oscillator strengths of the
individual lines as given in their Table 4), and taking the rest
wavelength of the Na i D λλ5890,5896 multiplet to be λNa i D =
5891.94 Å. A comparison with the observed wavelength of the
blend in our +25 d spectrum yields z = 0.041 ± 0.001. This is
consistent with the redshift of 0.042 reported by Mikuz et al.
(2013) for the host galaxy of SN 2013eq. As a further test we
performed a series of cross correlations using SNID (Supernova
Identiﬁcation, Blondin & Tonry 2007). Suggested matches were
scrutinized and the selected results span a range of redshifts con-
sistent with our result. We therefore adopt z = 0.041 ± 0.001 as
redshift of the SN.

2.2. Photometry

SN 2013eq was likely observed shortly after peak brightness
and the initial magnitudes of 18.548 ± 0.030 and 18.325 ± 0.022
measured in Bessell-B and SDSS-r′, respectively, are presum-
ably very close to the maximum in these bands. The light curves
initially decline at relatively steep rates of 3.5 ± 0.1 mag/100 d in
Bessell-B, 2.1 ± 0.2 mag/100 d in Bessell-V, 2.1 ± 0.2 mag/100 d
in SDSS-r′, and 3.4 ± 0.1 mag/100 d in SDSS-i′ until about 10
to 15 days after discovery. Then the decline rates slow down
to 0.95 ± 0.02 mag/100 d in Bessell-V, 0.17 ± 0.02 mag/100 d in
SDSS-r′, and 0.60 ± 0.03 mag/100 d in SDSS-i′ between ∼25 d
and ∼55 d after discovery, whilst the Bessel-B light curve dis-
plays no break. Type II-P SNe display a plateau phase with al-
most constant brightness after a short (or sometimes negligible)
initial decline (e.g. Anderson et al. 2014). Typically the plateau
phase lasts up to 100 d before the light curve drops onto the ra-
dioactive tail. This transition was, however, not observed for SN
2013eq. Table A.2 in the appendix shows the log of imaging ob-
servations as well as the ﬁnal calibrated magnitudes. The light
curve is presented in Figure 2.

we also included the publicly available classiﬁcation spectrum4
obtained on 2013 July 31 and August 1 (Mikuz et al. 2013). The
fully reduced and calibrated spectra of SN 2013eq are presented
in Figure 3. They are corrected for reddening (E(B − V)tot =
0.096 mag) and redshift (z = 0.041).

The strongest feature in the spectra is Hα, which would be
matched by the corresponding features at about 4850 Å, 4300 Å
and 4100 Å in the blue to be Hβ, Hγ and Hδ. In the classiﬁca-
tion spectrum, Hα and Hβ proﬁles are visible though relatively
weakly. They become stronger at later epochs and we can discern
also Hγ, and Hδ. We can also discern a feature at about 5900 Å
which is typically assigned to He i λ5876. Leonard et al. (2002)
claim that it evolves into a blend with Na i D at later epochs in
SN 1999em.

Finally, we can observe weak lines of iron between 4000 and
5500 Å. In particular Fe ii 5169 which is visible in the spectra
from +11 d on. Fe ii 5018 is visible only in the +65 d spectrum.
At this epoch we also see weak lines around 4450 Å and 4860 Å
which have been attributed to a blend of Fe ii, Ba ii and Ti ii in
SN 1999em by Leonard et al. (2002).

As mentioned earlier, the EPM was originally suggested by
Kirshner & Kwan (1974) and in the past decades a number of
improvements and variations have been presented. In this sec-
tion, however, we will only outline the most basic principle of
the EPM, laying the foundation for the more detailed derivations
in Section 3.2 regarding the application of the EPM at higher
redshifts.

The photospheric angular size ϑ of a Type II supernova of

redshifts z ≪ 1 can be described as5:

ϑ = 2

R
D

= 2s fλ

ζ2
λπBλ(T )

,

(1)

where R is the photospheric radius, D the distance to the SN,
fλ the observed ﬂux density, ζλ the distance correction factor
or dilution factor, and Bλ(T ) the Planck function evaluated at
observed color temperature T . ζλ is derived from model atmo-
spheres and is used to correct dilution eﬀects of scattering atmo-
spheres meaning that a SN will not emit as a perfect black body.
Due to the huge explosion energy the SN rapidly assumes a state
of homologous expansion and the radius of the SN at a certain
time t is

This means that with a minimum of two measurements spaced
in time of ϑ and v, Equation 3 can be solved for the distance D
and time of explosion t0.

3.2. EPMathighredshifts

The comparison of the ﬂux with the angular size of an object
forms the cornerstone on which the concept of the EPM rests
(cf. Equation 1). However, it is advisable to be prudent when
dealing with SNe at non-negligible redshifts, where the “angular
distance” and the “luminosity distance” diﬀer by a factor of (1 +
z)2 (e.g. Rich 2001):

Dθ =

DL

(1 + z)2 .

(4)

While at z = 0.01 a factor of (1 + z)2 results only in a ∼2% dis-
crepancy, this eﬀect increases quadratically and at a redshift of
only 0.05 the diﬀerence between luminosity distance and angu-
lar distance is already ∼10%.

Bearing in mind our derived redshift of z = 0.041 ± 0.001
for SN 2013eq, relativistic eﬀects cannot be ignored. We there-
fore re-derive the basic equation for the EPM for non-negligible
redshifts. In the following “⋆” will be used to denote the SN
rest frame, while “3” will be used for variables in the observed
frame.

The luminosity distance DL to the SN can be expressed as

f dered

3λ3

=

Lλ⋆
4πD2
L

,

(5)

where f dered
is the observed energy ﬂux in the observed wave-
3λ3
length interval ∆λ3, corrected for galactic and extragalactic ex-
tinction and Lλ⋆ is the total monochromatic luminosity in the
rest frame wavelength interval ∆λ⋆. The factor (1 + z) takes into
account that f dered
and Lλ⋆ are given in diﬀerent coordinate sys-
3λ3
tems. Lλ⋆ can also be expressed in terms of the monochromatic
radiation emitted in all directions: Lλ⋆ = ζ2
πBλ⋆(T⋆) · 4πR2
⋆,
λ⋆
where Bλ⋆(T⋆) is the Planck function evaluated at the tempera-
ture T⋆ of the SN and 4πR2
⋆ is the surface area of the SN with
radius R⋆. ζλ⋆ is the dilution factor in the SN rest frame. Equa-
tion 5 can therefore be rewritten as:

R⋆
DL

The photospheric angular size, or angular separation of the

photosphere, θ6 of a SN can be expressed as

R = v(t − t0) + R0.

θ = 2

(2)

R⋆
Dθ

,

(7)

v is the photospheric expansion velocity of the SN, t0 is the time
of explosion and R0 the initial radius. Compared to the extent
of the ejecta R0 becomes negligible very soon. Combining equa-
tions 1 and 2 the relation between the photospheric angular size
ϑ, the photospheric expansion velocity v, measured at time t can
be expressed as

where Dθ is the “angular distance”.

When dealing with non-negligible redshifts, the two terms
R⋆
D in Equations 6 and 7, are obviously not the same. While Equa-
tion 1 is indeed valid for z ≪ 1 Equations 4, 6 and 7 can be com-
bined to derive the correct relation between θ and the observed
ﬂux:

D =

2v
ϑ

(t − t0)

5 Note that most publications that make use of the EPM leave out the
factor of “2” in Eqn. 1. Although it eventually cancels out in the ﬁnal
distance result (see Equation 3) in the interest of completeness and cor-
rectness, we will preserve this factor in Eqn. 1.

while the symbol “ϑ” denotes the approximation of the angular size that
is only valid at low redshifts (as in Equations 1 and 3).

where we deﬁned θ† := θ/(1 + z)2. Even though θ† is not an
“angular size” in the mathematical sense, it corresponds7 to the
“angular size”, ϑ, that was utilized for EPM in previous publi-
cations (e.g. Schmidt et al. 1994; Jones et al. 2009). Equation 3
thus transforms to

(10)

After careful examination of the various equations ﬁnding
their way into the ﬁnal distance result, let us draw attention to a
few particular points.

– First, the term f dered
3λ3

(1 + z) in Equation 8 can be transformed
to f dered
in the SN rest frame by applying a K-correction to
⋆λ⋆
observed ﬂux. This was already recognized by Schmidt et al.
(1994, see their Equation 6) who also note that their θ (which
corresponds to 1/2 θ† in this paper) is not an “angular size”
as in Wagoner (1977). Consequently, their distance result has
to be interpreted as a luminosity distance.

– Second, in order to determine the correct angular size, θ, of
objects at non-negligible redshifts the factor of (1 + z)2 has
to be taken into account.

– Third, when calculating the luminosity distance instead of
the angular distance the factors of (1 + z)2 in Equations 4 and
8 “cancel” each other out, resulting in Equation 10 which is
basically identical to the formulation that is commonly used
(see Equation 3). In short, the use of θ will result in an an-
gular distance, while the use of θ† will result in a luminos-
ity distance. This is a vital distinction that has, to our best
knowledge, hitherto been ignored. Accordingly, EPM dis-
tance results in literature that follow a formulation similar to
Equation 3 – the correct high-redshift formulation of which
is Equation 10 – should be regarded as luminosity distances.

We want to emphasize that in order to correctly apply the
EPM also to SNe at non-negligible redshifts the only correc-
tion to be made (compared to the low redshift EPM) is the K-
correction of the observed ﬂux. This implies the use of θ† in
Equation 10 and also means that previously published applica-
tions of the EPM are correct (regarding this matter) if the result-
ing distances are seen as luminosity distances and K-corrections
were either applied or negligible.

3.3. Thestandardizedcandlemethod

The SCM for Type II SNe was ﬁrst suggested by Hamuy & Pinto
(2002). Here however, we follow the approach of Nugent et al.
(2006), who were the ﬁrst to apply the SCM to SNe at redshifts
of up to z ∼ 0.3. The basic concept of the SCM is brieﬂy outlined
in the following.

Equation 1 in Nugent et al. (2006) describes a correlation
between the rest frame I-band magnitude, MI, the rest frame
(V − I)-color and the expansion velocity at 50 days after explo-
sion:

MI50 = −α log10(cid:18) v50,Fe ii

5000 (cid:19) − 1.36 [(V − I)50 − (V − I)0] + MI0 ,

(11)

7 aside from the aforementioned factor of “2”(see Footnote 5)

with α = 5.81, MI0 = −17.52 (for an H0 of 70 km s−1 Mpc−1)
and (V − I)0 = 0.53. An advantage of this formulation is that
no reddening correction is required for the observed photome-
try which can introduce an additional error if the host galaxy
reddening is unknown. This works reasonable well under the as-
sumption that the extinction laws are similar in most galaxies.
Therefore the observed magnitudes only need to be transformed
to the rest frame which can be easily attended to by applying a
K-correction. Consequently, equation 11 can be adopted for lo-
cal as well as more distant SNe. A practical limitation may be
the spectral coverage of the rest frame I band at higher redshift
needed for a precise K-correction.

The expansion velocity is typically estimated using the
Fe ii λ5169 line (e.g. Hamuy & Pinto 2002; Nugent et al. 2006;
Poznanski et al. 2009). As spectroscopic data 50 days after ex-
plosion might not always be available Nugent et al. (2006) ex-
plored the time dependence of the Fe ii λ5169 velocity and found
that at 50 days after explosion it can be estimated using the fol-
lowing relation (Nugent et al. 2006, Equation 2):

v50 = v(t)(cid:18) t

50(cid:19)0.464 ± 0.017

,

(12)

where v(t) is the Fe ii λ5169 velocity at time t after explosion.

4. Results and discussion

Measuring the distance to SN 2013eq using the expanding pho-
tosphere or standardized candle method, requires a number of
preparatory steps, like deriving the photospheric temperatures
and velocities (for EPM) or the magnitudes and velocities at
50 days after explosion (for SCM). The EPM additionally relies
on the use of appropriate dilution factors. Eastman et al. (1996)
calculated model atmospheres for Type II SNe and derived a
set of dilution factors for the ﬁlter combinations {BV}, {VIC},
{BVIC} and {JHK}. Hamuy et al. (2001) later re-calculated the
dilution factors for a diﬀerent photometric system and expanded
the number of ﬁlter combinations to {BV}, {VI}, {BVI}, {VZ},
{V J}, {VH}, {VK}, and {JHKN} using the same atmospheric
models. Dessart & Hillier (2005) also computed dilution factors
for the ﬁlter sets {BV}, {VI}, {BVI} and {JHK}, based on a
large set of photospheric-phase models of Type II SNe. The R-
band is typically excluded due to the strong Hα contribution.
Here, we will use the BVI dilution factors given by Hamuy et al.
(2001) and Dessart & Hillier (2005), as to include all available
data for SN 2013eq in our EPM distance estimate.

4.1. Temperatureevolution

The correct application of the BVI dilution factors for EPM im-
plies that the photospheric temperature is accordingly estimated
using the B,V, and I photometry. This in turn requires us to
transform the SDSS-i band photometry to the Johnson-Cousins
Filter System used in Hamuy et al. (2001) and Dessart & Hillier
(2005). Taking into consideration that the EPM requires the ﬂux
in the SN rest frame we ﬁrst calculate K-corrections by using the
SN 2013eq spectroscopy and the snake code (SuperNova Algo-
rithm for K-correction Evaluation) within the S3 package (In-
serra et al. in prep.). For the SDSS-i ﬁlter we determine the K-
correction to the rest frame Johnson-Cousins I band. Then, the
uncorrected observed photometry is interpolated to the epochs
of spectroscopic observations, and subsequently dereddened and
K-corrected. Eventually, the adjusted B, V, and I-band magni-
tudes are converted into physical ﬂuxes. The temperature at each

Article number, page 5 of 11

A&Aproofs:manuscript no. SN2013eq_paper

epoch is derived by ﬁtting a black body curve to the deduced
ﬂuxes and eﬀective wavelengths of the corresponding ﬁlters.

We carried out ancillary blackbody ﬁts and added or sub-
tracted the uncertainties in all possible combinations. The stan-
dard deviation of the resulting range of temperatures was taken
to be a conservative estimate of the uncertainty in the tempera-
ture. We adopted this approach in order to make full use of all
available information across all bands.
The results are presented in Table 1.

4.2. Velocities

The knowledge of the line velocities in SN 2013eq is crucial to
both the EPM and the SCM. The velocities are measured using
iraf by ﬁtting a Gaussian function to the minima of the various
lines. The uncertainty in the velocity determination is presumed
to be in the 5 % range.

Dessart & Hillier (2005) show that the velocity measured
from the Fe ii λ5169 absorption matches the photospheric ve-
locity within 5-10%. However, they also point out that this line
is only visible at later epochs. Leonard et al. (2002) and Leonard
(2002) argue that lines such as Fe ii λλ5018,5169 will overesti-
mate the photospheric velocities and that instead weak Fe ii lines
such as λλ4629,4670,5276,5318 give more accurate results. An
overestimation of the photospheric velocities would lead to dis-
tances that are too large for both the EPM and the SCM.

Whilst a precise stipulation of the photospheric velocity is
indeed desirable we have to bear in mind that in the case of
SN 2013eq, many of the weaker lines favored by Leonard et al.
(2002) and Leonard (2002) for the EPM are only visible in
the +65 d spectrum. However, the EPM requires measurements
of the photospheric velocity for no less than two epochs. This
leaves only three possible Fe ii lines that are visible in more than
one spectrum of SN 2013eq: Fe ii λ5018, Fe ii λ5169 and the
blended line Ba ii / Fe ii λ6147. For the purposes of the EPM an
average of the measured absorption velocities from these three
lines will be used (see Table 2).

For the SCM we infer the velocity at 50 days after explo-
sion by means of the Fe ii λ5169 velocities and Equation 12 (see
Section 4.4 for more details).

4.3. TheEPMdistancetoSN2013eq

Having performed all necessary measurements we are now ready
to wade into the ﬁnal steps towards calculation an EPM distance
for SN 2013eq. As mentioned above, we use the BVI dilution
factors as given by Hamuy et al. (2001) and Dessart & Hillier
(2005). Both groups ﬁnd that the dilution factor essentially is
a function of temperature that can be described as ζ(TS ) =

Pi aS ,i(104 K/TS )i with S representing the ﬁlter subset (in our

case {BVI}). The parameters aS ,i are given in Appendix C, Ta-
ble 14 for Hamuy et al. (2001) and Table 1 for Dessart & Hillier
(2005).

In order to apply Equation 8 to SN 2013eq we rewrite it as

θ† = 2vt

f dered
⋆,F

ζ2
⋆,BVI(T⋆,BVI)πB(λ⋆,eﬀF , T⋆,BVI)

,

(13)

where λ⋆,eﬀF is the eﬀective wavelength of the corresponding
Filter, F, in the rest frame. Note that we use θ† instead of θ in
our calculations in order not to introduce an additional error on
the ﬁnal result due to the uncertainty of the redshift.

Article number, page 6 of 11

Finally, rearranging Equation 10 gives us:

χ :=

θ†
2v

=

t − t0
DL

.

(14)

For each ﬁlter B, V, and I, values of χ at the corresponding
epochs are ﬁtted linearly using DL and t0 as parameters. The
errors are estimated by executing complementary ﬁts through
the same values of χ, but adding or subtracting the uncertain-
ties in all possible combinations. The standard deviations of the
resulting range in distances as well as epochs of explosion are
then employed as conservative estimates of their respective un-
certainties. The results are presented in Figure 4 and Table 3
for each set of dilution factors from Hamuy et al. (2001) and
Dessart & Hillier (2005), respectively.

Note that while the derived distances and explosion epochs in
the B- and I-band are very similar, the V-band distance is about
24% smaller than the I-band distance for both sets of dilution
factors. Similar eﬀects have also been observed by other groups
performing the EPM. Hamuy et al. (2001), for example, ﬁnd a
diﬀerence of up to 20% in their distances when applying the
EPM to SN 1999em for varying ﬁlter combinations and attribute
these disparities to systematic errors in the dilution corrections.
Jones et al. (2009) apply the EPM to 12 SNe and ﬁnd varying re-
sults for for diﬀerent ﬁlter combinations for all their SNe. In the
case of SN 1999em the distances reported by Jones et al. (2009)
diﬀer by almost 26% between the BV and the VI ﬁlter combina-
tions. It stands to reason that the discrepancies appearing when
applying the EPM for diﬀerent ﬁlter combinations are reﬂected
also when applying it to single ﬁlters instead of ﬁlter combina-
tions.

Our ﬁnal errors on the distance are in the range of ∼ 12% and
take into account the uncertainties from the magnitudes, the red-
shift, the K-corrections, the velocities and the host galaxy red-
dening. These are propagated through all calculations and build
the basis for the uncertainties of the ﬂux, the temperature, and the
angular size. In an attempt to estimate the global errors of their
distances Jones et al. (2009) perform 1000 Monte Carlo simula-
tions varying over parameters such as photometry, redshift, fore-
ground & host-galaxy extinction, line expansion velocity, pho-
tospheric velocity conversion as well as dilution factors and ﬁnd
errors between 10 and 41% for distances to the SNe in their sam-
ple. Leonard (2002) follow a similar approach in calculating a
set of simulations while varying over the velocities, magnitudes
and dilution factors. They ﬁnd statistical distance errors for SN
1999em of only a few percent, however they point out that the
error of the EPM distance to SN 1999em is likely dominated by
systematic errors as the results derived using dilution factors for
diﬀerent ﬁlter combinations vary by as much as 19%.

4.4. TheSCMdistancetoSN2013eq

Compared to the EPM the utilization of the SCM is somewhat
less laborious. As mentioned in Section 3.3, to begin with, the
magnitudes used for the SCM have to be transformed to the SN
rest frame. We therefore calculate K-corrections by using the SN
2013eq spectroscopy and the snake code (SuperNova Algorithm
for K-correction Evaluation) within the S3 package (Inserra et
al. in prep.). For the SDSS-i′ band we select the K-corrections
to the rest frame Johnson-Cousins I Filter. These values are then
interpolated to an epoch of 50 d post-explosion.

We next need to derive the magnitude I50 and color (V − I)50
i.e., 50 d after explosion. We therefore ﬁt low-order polynomials
to the uncorrected photometry and subsequently transform it to

the rest frame by applying the K-corrections. The expansion ve-
locity is determined using the relation in equation 12. We then
use our measured Fe ii λ5169 velocities to estimate an appropri-
ate value for 50 d.

We repeated the above procedure three times using the epoch
of explosion derived via EPM with the dilution factors from
Hamuy et al. (2001) and Dessart & Hillier (2005). We addition-
ally, estimated the explosion epoch by utilizing the average rise
time for SNe II-P of 7.0 ± 0.3 as given by Gall et al. (2015) as-
suming that SN 2013eq was discovered close to maximum. This
is likely a valid assumption given its spectral and photometric
evolution. Finally, equation 11 – which essentially describes the

relation between the I-band magnitude, the (V − I)-color and the
expansion velocity 50 days after explosion – is applied for each
of the three cases.

Note, that the uncertainty in the explosion epoch will intro-
duce and error to all quantities derived at 50 days after explosion.
An earlier explosion epoch will ultimately result in a larger dis-
tance. This has been discussed also by Nugent et al. (2006), who
found that the explosion date uncertainty has the largest impact
on the ﬁnal error compared to other contributions, and also by
Poznanski et al. (2009) who, in contrast, ﬁnd that their results
vary only little with the explosion epoch arguing that the magni-
tudes and colors are relatively constant during the plateau phase.

4.

We ﬁnd that even though the explosion epoch for SN 2013eq by
applying the EPM has relatively large uncertainties, we ﬁnd that
this contributes only little to the uncertainties of the V- and I-
band magnitudes and consequently also the (V − I) color at 50
days after explosion. These are of the same order as the origi-
nal uncertainties in the photometry. The time of explosion un-
certainty is, however, more signiﬁcant when determining the ex-
pansion velocity at 50 days, although the error in the Fe ii λ5169
velocities and the intrinsic error in Equation 12 also contribute
to the total error.

The uncertainty in the redshift plays an almost negligible
role. For completeness we did however propagate its error when
accounting for time dilation. Note, that Hamuy & Pinto (2002)
ﬁnd peculiar motions in nearby galaxies (cz < 3000 km s−1) con-
tribute signiﬁcantly to the overall scatter in their Hubble dia-
gram; however this is not a relevant issue for SN 2013eq.

The ﬁnal uncertainties in the distance modulus and the dis-
tance are propagated from the errors in MI50, v50,Fe ii and (V −I)50.
The derived distance moduli and luminosity distances as well as
the intermediate results are given in Table 4.

4.5. ComparisonofEPMandSCMdistances

An inspection of Table 3 reveals that the two EPM luminosity
distances derived using the dilution factors from Hamuy & Pinto
(2002) and Dessart & Hillier (2005) give consistent values. This
is no surprise, bearing in mind that the dilution factors from
Hamuy & Pinto (2002) and Dessart & Hillier (2005) applied for
SN 2013eq diﬀer by only 18-27 % (see Table 2). Similarly, the
resulting explosion epochs are also consistent with each other.

Likewise, the SCM distances calculated utilizing the times
of explosion found via EPM and the dilution factors from either
Hamuy & Pinto (2002) or Dessart & Hillier (2005) (see Table 4),
as well as by adopting the average SN II-P rise time as given by
Gall et al. (2015), are consistent not only with each other but also
with the EPM results.

It is remarkable how close our outcomes are within the er-
rors to the distance of 176 Mpc calculated from the redshift of
SN 2013eq with the simple formula D = cz/H0 (for H0 =
70 km s−1 Mpc−1). While this is of course no coincidence for the
SCM-distances (which are based on H0 = 70 km s−1 Mpc−1), the
EPM-distance is completely independent as to any assumptions
concerning the Hubble constant. This is particularly encourag-
ing, considering the scarcity of data points for our ﬁts stemming
mostly from the diﬃculty of measuring the velocities of weak
iron lines in our spectra. It seems that both the SCM and the EPM
are surprisingly robust techniques to determine distances even at
non-negligible redshifts where high cadence observations are not
always viable.

5. Conclusions

We presented optical light curves and spectra of the Type II-P
SN 2013eq. It has a redshift of z = 0.041 ± 0.001 which inspired
us to embark on an analysis of relativistic eﬀects when apply-
ing the expanding photosphere method to SNe at non-negligible
redshifts.

We ﬁnd that for the correct use of the EPM to SNe at non-
negligible redshifts, the observed ﬂux needs to be converted into
the SN rest frame, e.g. by applying a K-correction. In addition,
the angular size, θ, has to be corrected by a factor of (1 + z)2 and
the resulting EPM distance will be an angular distance. However,
when using a modiﬁed version of the angular size θ† = θ/(1 + z)2
the EPM can be applied in the same way as has previously been
done for small redshifts, with the only modiﬁcation being a K-
correction of the observed ﬂux. The fundamental diﬀerence is
that this will result in a luminosity distance instead of an angular
distance.

For the SCM we follow the approach of Nugent et al. (2006),
who outline its use for SNe at cosmologically signiﬁcant red-
shifts. Similar to the EPM their formulation of the high red-
shift SCM requires the observed magnitudes to be transformed
into the SN rest frame, which in practice corresponds to a K-
correction.

We ﬁnd EPM luminosity distances of DL = 151 ± 18 Mpc
and DL = 164 ± 20 Mpc as well as times of explosions of
4.1 ± 4.4 d and 3.1 ± 4.1 d before discovery (rest frame), by
making use of the dilution factors as given by Hamuy et al.
(2001) and Dessart & Hillier (2005), respectively. Assuming SN
2013eq was discovered close to maximum light this would re-
sult in rise times that are in line with those of local SNe II-P
(Gall et al. 2015). With the times of explosions derived via the
EPM – having used the dilution factors from either Hamuy et al.
(2001) or Dessart & Hillier (2005) – we ﬁnd SCM luminosity
distances of DL = 160 ± 32 Mpc and DL = 157 ± 31 Mpc. By uti-
lizing the average rise time of SNe II-P as presented in Gall et al.
(2015) to estimate the epoch of explosion we ﬁnd an independent
SCM distance of DL = 168 ± 16 Mpc.

The luminosity distances derived using diﬀerent dilution fac-
tors as well as either EPM or SCM are consistent with each
other. Considering the scarcity of viable velocity measurements
it is encouraging that our results lie relatively close to the ex-
pected distance of ∼ 176 Mpc calculated from the redshift of SN
2013eq.

With current and upcoming transient surveys, it appears to
be only a matter of time until statistically signiﬁcant numbers
of SNe II-P become available also at non-negligible redshifts.
Consequently, the promise of yielding sound results will turn the
EPM and SCM into increasingly important cosmological tools,
provided the requisite follow-up capabilities are in place.

The tabulated magnitudes are given “as observed”, i.e. neither corrected for dust extinction or K-corrected. ∗Rest frame epochs
(assuming a redshift of 0.041) with respect to the ﬁrst detection on 56503.882 (MJD). ∗∗K-corrections were calculated by ﬁrst
using the SN 2013eq spectroscopy and the snake code (SuperNova Algorithm for K-correction Evaluation) within the S3 package
(Inserra et al. in prep.). These values were then interpolated to all epochs of photometric observations. The K-corrections are not
included in the tabulated photometry. For the SDSS-r′ and SDSS-i′ band we calculate the K-correction to the rest frame
Johnson-Cousins R and I band. LT = Liverpool Telescope; GTC = Gran Telescopio CANARIAS.

∗Rest frame epochs (assuming a redshift of 0.041) with respect to the ﬁrst detection on 56503.882 (MJD). The ﬁrst (+2 d) spectrum
is the classiﬁcation spectrum (Mikuz et al. 2013; Tomasella et al. 2014). The resolution of the GTC and WHT spectra was
determined from the FWHM of the O i λ5577.34 sky line.
