Nontrivial Periodic Minimizer for

Landau-Brazovskii Model with Constraint

March 29, 2016

Abstract

We study the Landau-Brazovskii model with constraint, which is
in the form of a second order variational problem on the real line. By
reducing to handy situations, we ﬁnd a nontrivial periodic minimal
solution. Moreover, the proof is kept as simple and self-contained as
possible in our speciﬁc case.

Introduction

1.1 A digression on block copolymer

Block copolymer, a synthesized polymer material, has found many applica-
tions in industry. It is consisting of multiple sequences of monomer alter-
nating in series with diﬀerent monomer blocks. The combination of diﬀerent
polymers endows the polymer material with rich properties, which are the
key to their important applications. An example of such property manip-
ulation can be seen in poly(urethane) foams, which are used in bedding
and upholstery. Poly(urethane), a multiblock copolymer, is characterized by
high-temperature resilience and low-temperature ﬂexibility. Another impor-
tant use of block copolymers is in industrial melt-adhesives. By combining
polystyrene with polymers which exhibit rubber-like and adhesive properties,
sturdy adhesives can be formed which are activated by heat. The structure
of this copolymer utilizes polystyrene blocks on the outside and the rubber
block on the inside. When heat is applied, the polystyrene parts melt and al-
low for limited liquid-like ﬂow. The middle section causes adhesion and after

1

the temperature drops, the strength of polystyrene is restored. This prop-
erty, made possible by the combination of polystyrene with other polymers,
makes this block copolymer an important adhesive.

The importance of block copolymer has drawn attention to mathemati-
cians. Various mathematical models are developed to explore the properties
of block copolymer. Landau-Brazovskii model, among the most popular mod-
els, is the simplest yet desirable in capturing the nature of copolymer and
thus gained much acceptance. It will be our protagonist in this paper.

1.2 Model speciﬁcation

Landau-Brazovskii is formulated as below,

I∞ (̟) = ZR(cid:26) ξ2

2

[̟′′ (t) + ̟ (t)]2 +

τ
2

̟2 (t) −

γ
6

̟3 (t) +

1
24

̟4 (t)(cid:27) dt, (1)

which models the energy of block copolymer in terms of speciﬁc controlling
parameters ξ > 0, τ, γ ∈ R.

Block copolymer is determined by its molecular arrangement. Each molec-
ular structure or state, by the language of the model, is represented by ̟.
For the purpose of application, the structure or ̟ is required to meet certain
practical restrictions,

(i) ̟ (t) is a periodic function with period, say, τ = τ (̟) > 0;

(ii) The structure ̟ (t) is evenly distributed,

Z τ

0

̟ (t) dt = 0;

(iii) The block copolymer should behave steadily around the state ̟ (t),
to be precise, structure ̟ (t) should not slide easily into another state
when the controlling parameters are slightly perturbed, therefore, it is
necessary for ̟ (t) to have the minimal energy in some sense.

1.3 Criterion for minimizer

The model posed in the last subsection comes down to a minimizing problem
with constraints. But it is not quite the minimizing problem which can be
solved straightforwardly using the direct method in the calculus of variation.
For one thing, the energy functional is deﬁned on the real line and the period
of ̟ (t) is allowed to vary, hence the compactness of the minimizing sequence

2

is thus lossed. On the other hand, the criterion for minimizer is not clearly,
since there are functions for which I∞ (̟) = −∞, in which case a strightfor-
ward minimization does not make sense. Hence the criterion for minimizer
needs to be speciﬁcally understood. One way to overcome this diﬃculty is
to minimize the average energy rather than the energy itself. Speciﬁcally,
consider the problem

lim inf
T →+∞

1
T

IT (f ; ̟) → min,

to be noted, it will be shown in Proposition 3 below that the functional (1)
on R may be replaced by one on the half real line R+. But this optimal
criterion is much two loose for practical purposes, since it will never fail
to ﬁnd functions which may have diﬀerent behaviors on compacts but still
reach the same minimal average energy level. Another criterion for inﬁnite
horizon problems founds its source in optimal control problem in economics,
it was introduced by [5] and [13]. It is referred to as ”overtaking optimality
criterion”. As [3], we shall adapt this optimal criterion, such a minimizer
will have minimal energy on every compact intervals and minimal average
energy on the whole real line, these will be made clear in deﬁnition 8. This
speciﬁcation of minimizer has the advantage that its mathematical properties
are physically desirable.

The Landau-Brazovskii model (1) has been employed by many chemists
and physists to simulate the block copolymer. However, few literatures have
been devoted to the exploration of mathematical nature of the model.
In
fact, this is a diﬃcult problem and needs in-depth investigation.
[3] may
be the ﬁrst eﬀort in this direction, the authors proved existence of a global
periodic minimizer of (1) without constaints by localizing. Later [4] and
[6] studied the cosntrained version of model (1). Both [3] and [4] assume a
general functional form. A.J.Zaslavski also extended the studies of [3][4] and
made an investigation into the structure and turpike properties of the optimal
solutions, one may refer to [6] and references therein. In particular, (1) is
related to a class of fourth order diﬀerential equations, for further reference
in this respect, the readers are sent to [11, 9, 10, ?].

In [8], the model (1) with symmetric double well potential is studied
and the existence of global periodic minimizer is shown. The author also
proved the symmetric property of the minimizer. In addition, without the
presence of symmetric property, a non-existence result is given there. In this
paper, we study the constrained version of [8]’s model, but we do not assume
any symmetric properties of (1). The proof is given following that of [6],
however, we are interested in the existence of nontrivial periodic minimizer,
a suﬃcient condition for the existence is given. Since our model takes a

3

speciﬁc functional form, the proof can be as simple and self-contained as
possible. We shall see that the condition given in [3], which ensures the
existence of nontrivial perodic minimizer, is also the key to the existence of
nontrivial perodic minimizer of the contrained problem.

1.4 Notations and preparations

Before going further, we introduce some notions.

the function is determined by controlling parameters ξ, τ, γ. Denote the
energy on a bounded interval [T1, T2] by

IT1,T2 (f ; ̟) = Z T2

T1

f (̟, ̟′, ̟′′) dt,

Note the integrand is independent of t, we have

IT1,T2 (f ; ̟) = I0,T2−T1 (f ; ̟) .

Therefore, for simplicity of notions, we always use IT (f ; ̟) to represent
the integration on any bounded interval of length T > 0. This convention
will be adopted as appropriate through out in this paper.

Corresponding to IT (f ; ̟) , we denote by JT (f ; ̟) the average energy

on bounded intervals of length as T > 0,

JT (f ; ̟) =

1
T

IT (f ; ̟) .

We have the minimization problem PT (f ; x, y) ,

ζT (f ; x, y) = inf { JT (f ; ̟)| ̟ ∈ AT (x, y)} ,

where

AT (x, y) = (cid:8) ̟ ∈ W 2,1 (0, T )(cid:12)(cid:12) V̟ (0) = x, V̟ (T ) = y(cid:9) ,

V̟ (s) = (̟ (s) , ̟′ (s)) ∈ R2.

Note that V̟ (s) denotes the vector formed by the value of ̟ and its deriva-
tive at the point s. The notion will be used frequently.

on the positive half real line. In the following, we shall abandon the notion ψ+
f
(resp. ψ+
f (a)) and use ψf (resp. ψf (a)) to indicate the minimizing problems
in question.

Deﬁnition 5 The diﬀerential ∂ϑ (x∗) of a convex function ϑ (x) at x = x∗
is deﬁned as the set

{λ ∈ R : ϑ (z) > ϑ (x∗) + λ (z − x∗) , ∀z ∈ R} .

If there exists λ ∈ R such that,

ϑ (z) > ϑ (¯x) + λ (z − ¯x) , ∀z 6= ¯x,

then ¯x is called the exposed point of ϑ.

2 Main result and open problem

We consider only the case of zero mean constraint (i.e., [̟] = 0), other case
being similar.

Recall that e is an extreme point of a convex set K, if e does not belong to
the segment (excluding the end points) connecting any two points e1, e2 ∈ K.
The extreme point to a convex function is deﬁned as extreme point to its
graph.

Theorem 6 Let f be the energy conﬁguration (2) determined by parameters
ξ > 0, τ, γ ∈ R such that 0 is an exposed point of ψf (x), and

ψf (0) < mf = inf {f (t, 0, 0) |t ∈ R } .

(5)

then there is a nontrivial periodic solution to the constrained minimization
problem P (f ; 0).

Before diving into the proof of the theorem, we would like to put down a

few remarks which we formulated into the following open problems.

Open problems
The model (1) has been put forward to help simulate copolymer, thus it
is expected to have certain conditions for the existence of periodic minimizer
that are easy to verify. The result of Theorem 6 may be succinct itself.
However, being exposed point is an property that is diﬃcult to validate both
from theoretical and numerical perspective. Our problem is whether we can
ﬁnd an alternative condition for being an exposed point. For this, we have
the following conjecture.

Let h (x) be any potential function with double well (not necessarily sym-

metric), the potential term in (1) is an example of such h (x),

h (x) =

where ̟ ∈ E is periodic in t (the period is diﬀerent from ̟ to ̟), recalling

h∗ (x) =

If the above conjecture is true, then the condition of exposed point can be
dropped. If it is not true, then are there any other alternative conditions for
being an exposed point which are easy to verify ?

9

3 Preliminaries

Theorem 7 The problem on the entire real line has the same minimum as
that on the harf real line. Therefore, it is enough to consider the problem on
the half line.

Deﬁnition 8 The function ̟ ∈ E is a strongly optimal solution to P (f ) if

the set of all strongly optimal solutions is denoted by Ξ (f ) , and that which
are periodic is denoted by ˜Ξ (f ) .

[2] showed Ξ (f ) and ˜Ξ (f ) are all nonempty. If no confusion arises, all

minimizers below would mean strongly optimal solutions.

Theorem 9 ψf (x) is a convex function of x.

Let x ∈ R2, deﬁne

πf (x) = inf nlim inf

T →∞

[IT (f ; ̟) − T ψf ](cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

Theorem 10 For T > 0, x, y ∈ R2. There are πf (x), θT (f, x, y) such that
ζT (f, x, y) may be decomposed as follows,

T ζT (f, x, y) = T ψf + πf (x) − πf (y) + θT (f, x, y) ,

where πf (x) is continuous w.r.t. x, θT (f, x, y) is a nonnegative continuous
function of (T, x, y), moreover,

θT (f, x, y) = 0, for any x ∈ R2.

min
y∈R2

Here we list some properties that will be refered to in later proofs.

Property A The mapping T 7−→ [IT (f ; ̟) − T ψf ] is bounded on R+.

Remark 11 It is a by-product from the proof of [3], that any funtion ̟ ∈ E
satisfying deﬁnition 8 (i) possesses Property A. This observation was later
reﬁned by [7].

10

Property B For any bounded interval [T1, T2] ,

IT1,T2 (f ; ̟) − (T2 − T1) ψf + πf (V̟ (T1)) − πf (V̟ (T2)) .

Proposition 12 Let T > 0, and ̟ ∈ W 2,1 ([0, T ]). Then IT (f ; ̟) < ∞ if
and only if ̟ ∈ W 2,2 ([0, T ]) .
Proof. Assume ̟ ∈ W 2,2 ([0, T ]) , it easy to see IT (f ; ̟) < ∞. On the
other hand, ̟ ∈ W 2,1 ([0, T ]) and IT (f ; ̟) < ∞ imply ̟ ∈ W 2,2 ([0, T ]) .

The above lemma tells us, the space W 2,1 ([0, T ]) is enough for our prob-

lem though W 2,2 ([0, T ]) seems more natural.

Theorem 13 ([4]) The function ψf (x) is convex w.r.t. x. In particular,
ψf (x) is continuous.

The theorem has an important consequence which is fundamental to the

proof of the main result. We state it in the following lemma.

For the function f (x, y, z) in (2), and λ ∈ R, we deﬁne the lagrangian,

fλ (x, y, z) = f (x, y, z) − λx.

Lemma 14 For the function ψf (x), the following relations hold

ψfλ = ψf (η) − λη, ∀λ ∈ ∂ψf (η) , ∀η ∈ R.

Θ (f ; η) ⊂ Θ (fλ) , ∀λ ∈ ∂ψf (η) , ∀η ∈ R.

Moreover, if η is an exposed point of ψf (x), then

Θ (f ; η) = Θ (fλ) .

(6)

(7)

(8)

Proof. Since ψf (x) is convex, we may deﬁne its conjugate function

f (z) = sup

(10)

the left hand side is nothing else than ψfλ, therefore (7) is veriﬁed.

In addition, η being an exposed point of ψf (x) implies the equality in (9)
holds only when z = η. Hence every ̟ solving (10) should verify [̟] = η,
that is

Θ (f ; η) ⊂ Θ (fλ) ,

showing that (8) is valid in the case of exposed point.

Remark 15 The proof of the lemma also indicates

Θ (fλ) = [ {Θ (f ; η) , λ ∈ ∂ψf (η)} , ∀λ ∈ R.

(11)

The following theorem is implied in [3], and explicitly stated in [7], since

the proof is not provided there, we give it here in detail.

Theorem 16 Let λn be a bounded sequence and ˜̟n the optimal periodic so-
lution to problem P (fλn). If the sequence of minimal energy ψfλn is bounded.

Lemma 17 ([7]) Suppose that ˜̟ is a periodic, nontrivial minimizer for
P (f ), τ being its minimal period. By an appropriate shift of variable, we
may suppose

˜̟ (0) = min
s∈R

˜̟ (s) ,

then, there is ˜τ ∈ (0, τ ) , ˜̟ is strictly increasing on [0, ˜τ ] while strictly de-
creasing on [˜τ , τ ].

Lemma 18 ([7]) Suppose ̟ ∈ E possessing Property A, then for any ς ∈
Ω (̟) , there is ¯̟ ∈ E possessing Property B such that

{V ¯̟ (s)| s ∈ R} ⊂ Ω (̟) , V ¯̟ (0) = ς,

where

Ω (̟) = (cid:8) ν ∈ R2(cid:12)(cid:12) ∃sn → ∞, V̟ (sn) → ν(cid:9) .

We are now in a position to prove the main theorem,

4 Existence of minimizer

This whole section is devoted to the proof of the main result.

Assume that 0 is an extreme point of ψf (x), then there exists a sequence
of exposed points {θn} of ψf (x) tending to 0. Without loss of generality, we
may suppose that the sequence {θn} is non-increasing and θn 6= 0, ∀n. Since
each θn is an exposed point, we have an optimal periodic solution ˜̟n to
the constrained minimization problem P (f ; θn). Denote by τn the minimal
positive period of ˜̟n.

The crux of the problem concentrates on the sequence of periods τn. In
fact, if we show {τn} is bounded, then we can easily derive a minimizer
from the minimizing sequence { ˜̟n}. The condition (5) not only guarantees
the boundedness of {τn}, but also ensures us a nontrivial optimal solution.
To prove the theorem, we employ an argument of contradiction. That is,
if {τn} is unbounded, then we will reach the conclusion that, for ∀ε > 0,
there is 0 > ̺ > −ε satisfying ψf (̺) = f (̺, 0, 0) , this obviously contradicts
condition (5). To make the it easier to follow, we carry out the proof in
several steps.

Lemma 19 The sequence { ˜̟n}n>1 does not admit a subsequence { ˜̟nk}k>1
that are all constant.

Proof. Suppose otherwise that { ˜̟nk} are all constant functions. Since
[ ˜̟nk] = θnk , then ˜̟nk (t) ≡ θnk . Each function ˜̟nk (t) is an optimal solution
of P (f, θnk), hence

ψf (θnk) =

1

τn Z τn

0

f (cid:0) ˜̟nk, ˜̟′

nk

, ˜̟′′

nk(cid:1) dt = f (θnk , 0, 0) .

But the convex function ψf (x) is continous at x = 0, therefore

ψf (0) = f (0, 0, 0) ,

15

this contradicts (5). Thus we may assume all { ˜̟n (t)}n>1 are not constant
functions.

By lemma 14, there is λn ∈ ∂ψf (θn) such that ˜̟n ∈ ˜M (fλn) and fλn =
f (u, u′, u′′) − λnu. Since θn is non-increasing and ψf (x) is a convex function
which is ﬁnite everywhere, so {λn} must be non-increasing and has a lower
bound, then {λn} has a limit point λ∗. By deﬁnition of subdiﬀerential,

ψf (z) > ψf (θn) + λn (z − θn) , ∀z.

therefore

namely, λ∗ ∈ ∂ψf (0) .

ψf (z) > ψf (0) + λ∗z, ∀z,

Lemma 20 The sequence { ˜̟n} is locally bounded in W 4,2 (R) , that is, for
any compact interval [a, b], there is a constant C > 0 depending only on b−a,
such that

k ˜̟nkW 4,2([a,b]) 6 C, ∀n.

Proof. By theorem 16, there is a constant C > 0, such that

k ˜̟nkW 1,∞(R) 6 C, ∀n.

Indeed, the function f (x, y, z) allows lower bound of the form

f (x, y, z) > a1 |x|4 − a2 |y|2 + a3 |z|2 − a4,

(12)

(13)

where a1, a2, a3, a4 ∈ R are all positive constants. Noting that fλn (x, y, z) =
f (x, y, z) − λnx and λn is bounded, then fλn also admits the lower bound

fλn (x, y, z) > ˜a1 |x|4 − ˜a2 |y|2 + ˜a3 |z|2 − ˜a4,

where ˜a1, ˜a2, ˜a3, ˜a4 ∈ R are all positive constants independent of n. Therefore

fλn ( ˜̟n, ˜̟′

n, ˜̟′′

n) > ˜a1 |x|4 − ˜a2 |y|2 + ˜a3 |z|2 − ˜a4.

This inequality combining (13) gives (12). Furthermore, since ˜̟n solves the
E-L equation

˜̟′′′′

n + ˜̟′′

n + ˜̟n + h′ ( ˜̟n) = 0.

By (8) and the boundedness of λn, ˜̟n must be bounded in W 4,2 ([a, b]) ,
namely, there is a constant C > 0 (C depends only on the length b − a of the
interval), satisfying

k ˜̟nkW 4,2([a,b]) 6 C, ∀n.

Lemma 21 If τn → ∞, then ∀ε > 0, ∃˜υ∗

ε ∈ ˜Ξ (fλ∗) , lim inf

˜υ∗
ε (s) > −ε.

s→∞

Proof. Since the functional IT1,T2 (f, ̟) is independent of the time variable
t, we may assume

˜̟n (0) = min
s∈R

˜̟n (s) , ∀n.

Then ˜̟n (0) < θn. By lemma 17, there is ¯τn ∈ (0, τn), ˜̟n is strictly increasing
on (0, ¯τn) and strictly decreasing on (¯τn, τn). Consider the set

κn = {s ∈ (0, τn)| ˜̟n (s) > θn − ε} ,

by virtue of monotonic structure of ˜̟n, κn may be written as

κn = [ˇκn, ¯τn] ∪ [¯τn, ˆκn] .

Simple calculations show, (|κn| denotes the length of κn)

would lead to the contradictory inequality 0 6 −ε.

However, τn → ∞. Hence |κn| → ∞ and either the length of [ˇκn, ¯τn] or

[¯τn, ˆκn] tends to inﬁnity as n → ∞. Without no loss of generality, suppose

Deﬁne

¯τn − ˇκn → ∞.

˜υn (t) = ˜̟n (t + ˇκn) ,

(15)

(16)

Then {˜υn} is locally bounded in W 4,2 (R) by boundedness (12) of { ˜̟n}.
Furthermore, since ˜̟n ∈ ˜Ξ (fλn), we have, for any bounded interval [t1, t2] ,

Jt2−t1 (fλn, ˜̟n) = ζt2−t1 (fλn, V ˜̟n (t1) , V ˜̟n (t2)) .

17

Whence ˜υn (t) must satisfy the minimal relation

Jt2−t1 (fλn, ˜υn) = ζt2−t1 (fλn, V˜υn (t1) , V˜υn (t2)) .

(17)

Since {˜υn} is bounded in W 4,2 ([t1, t2]), we may suppose ˜υn converges weakly
in W 4,2 ([t1, t2]) to some element ˜υ∗ ∈ W 4,2 ([t1, t2]) . Note the deﬁnition of ˜υn
relies on ε, to emphasize this dependence, we will write ˜υ∗ as ˜υ∗
ε . By Sobolev
(compact) imbedding theorem,

W 4,2 ([t1, t2]) ֒→ C 3 ([t1, t2]) .

(18)

That is, ˜υn → ˜υ∗ in C 3 ([t1, t2]). Sending n in (17) to inﬁnity, we obtain

Jt2−t1 (fλ∗; ˜υ∗) = ζt2−t1 (fλ∗, V˜υ∗ (t1) , V˜υ∗ (t2)) ,

therefore, proposition 11 implies that ˜υ∗

ε ∈ ˜Ξ (fλ∗) .

For any s > 0, we have s ⊂ [0, ¯τn − ˇκn] as long as n is large enough. Since

˜υn is strictly increasing on [0, ¯τn − ˇκn], one must have, by (18),

˜υ∗
ε (s) = lim
n→∞

˜υn (s) > lim
n→∞

(θn − ε) = −ε,

hence

lim inf
s→∞

˜υ∗
ε (s) > −ε

We may take this inequality one step further by showing that the limit
lim
s→∞

˜υ∗
ε (s) actually exists and ̺ > −ε.

Note ˜υ∗

ε ∈ ˜Ξ (fλ∗) implies it is bounded on the real line. Moreover,
ε (s) ex-

˜υ∗
ε (s) = limn→∞ ˜υn (s) is non-decreasing on [0, ¯τn − ˇκn], so lims→∞ ˜υ∗
ists and it is denoted by ̺,

̺ = lim inf
s→∞

˜υ∗
ε (s) > −ε.

(19)

Lemma 22 The function ˜υ∗

ε is diﬀerentiable and lim
s→+∞

˜υ∗′
ε (s) = 0.

Proof. Take σ > 1,deﬁne

ξn (s) = ˜υ∗

ε (s + n) , s ∈ [0, σ] .

ε ∈ ˜Ξ (f ), Vξn (s) is bounded on [0, σ]. By the same reasoning as
Since ˜υ∗
lemma 20, we obtain that ξn (s) is bounded in W 4,2 ([0, σ]), one may suppose

18

ξn (s) converges weakly in W 4,2 [0, σ] to ξ (s) , the convergence is also valid
in the sense of C 3 ([0, σ]) by Sobolev imbedding theorem, therefore

ξ (s) = lim
n→∞

ξn (s) = lim
n→∞

˜υ∗
ε (s + n) = ̺, ∀s ∈ [0, σ] ,

namely, ξ (s) ≡ ̺, ∀s ∈ [0, σ] .
Now it is easy to see that ξ′

n (s) ⇒ 0, s ∈ [0, σ] . For otherwise, there exist

δ > 0 and snk ∈ [0, σ] ,

Assume with no loss that snk → ˜s ∈ [0, σ] . For any 0 6 s1 < s2 6 σ,

ξ′

nk (snk) = (cid:12)(cid:12)ξ′

nk (snk)(cid:12)(cid:12) > δ.

This indicates that ξ′

n (s) is compact in C ([0, σ]), therefore

ξ′
nk (snk) → ξ′ (˜s) ,

but ξ′ (˜s) = 0, which contradicts (20).

Now, since ξ′

n (s) ⇒ 0, s ∈ [0, σ] . Hence

˜υ∗′
ε (z) = ξ′

σ(z) (z − σ (z)) → 0, z → +∞,

where

σ (z) = j z

σk = max {n ∈ N : nσ 6 z < (n + 1) σ} .

Lemma 23 For ̺ deﬁned early, ψf (̺) = f (̺, 0, 0) .

Proof. By (19) ,

lim
T →∞

1

T Z T

0

˜υ∗ (s) ds = lim
T →∞

˜υ∗ (T ) = ̺,

but ˜υ∗ is an optimal solution to P (fλ∗, ̺), and

ψfλ∗ = ψf (̺) − λ∗̺.

(21)

19

Hence

ψf (̺) = f (̺, 0, 0) .

Indeed, since ˜υ∗ ∈ Ξ (fλ∗), we deduce from remark (11) that, there exists a
constant ˜C > 0 independent of T such that

|T ψfλ∗ − IT (fλ∗; ˜υ∗)| 6 ˜C, ∀T.

Lemma (18) then ensures an element ˘υ∗ ∈ E possessing Property B and

{ V˘υ∗ (s)| s ∈ R} ⊂ Ω (˜υ∗) = {(̺, 0)} ,

which implies ˘υ∗ ≡ ̺ and

ψfλ∗ = fλ∗ (0, 0, 0) = f (̺, 0, 0) − λ∗̺,

combining (21), we arrive at

ψf (̺) = f (̺, 0, 0) .

Lemma 24 ̺ 6 0.

Proof. Previous arguments show ˜υ∗ ∈ Θ (f, ̺) ∩ Θ (fλ∗) , it can be deduced
from (11) that λ∗ ∈ ∂ψf (̺) . Since λn is non-increasing and tends to λ∗, and
λ∗ ∈ ∂ψf (0), then we should have ̺ 6 0.

Lemma 25 τn 9 0.

Proof. By (14) and Sobolev imbedding theorem, one may suppose that

˜̟n (t) ⇒ ˜̟ (t) , ˜̟′

n (t) ⇒ ˜̟′ (t) , ˜̟′′

n (t) ⇒ ˜̟′′ (t) .

Assume τn → 0, take any t ∈ R, note that

1

τn Z t+τn

t

˜̟n (s) = θn,

an application of mean value theorem gives,

˜̟n (ςn) = θn, ςn ∈ (t, t + τn) ,

sending n → ∞, we have

˜̟n (t) ⇒ ˜̟ (t) = 0, ∀t ∈ R.

20

however, ˜̟n is an optimal solution, hence

ψf (θn) =

1

τn Z τn

0

f ( ˜̟n, ˜̟′

n, ˜̟′′

n) → f (0, 0, 0) ,

whence we obtain by sending n → ∞,

ψf (0) = f (0, 0, 0) ,

which contradicts (5).
Final proof of the main theorem. The proceeding lemmas show that,
if τn → ∞, then for any ε > 0, there is −ε 6 ̺ 6 0, such that ψf (̺) =
f (̺, 0, 0) , this is an obvious contradiction to (5). Hence τn is bounded and
has at least one limit point τ ∗ ∈ (0, ∞) . Assume without loss of generality
τn → τ ∗. Since ̟n is bounded in W 4,2

loc (R), there is a subsequence

̟nk ⇀ ̟∗ (W 4,2

loc (R)),

then ̟nk also converges uniformly on compacts, hence ̟∗ is a periodic func-
tion, denote its period by τ ∗. Therefore ̟∗ must be a solution to the mini-
mization problem P (fλ∗) with

Z τ ∗

0

̟∗ (s) ds = 0,

whence ̟∗ (s) is also optimal to P (f, 0),

it is not trivial by (5).
