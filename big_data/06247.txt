GENUS THREE CURVES AND 56 NODAL SEXTIC SURFACES

BERT VAN GEEMEN, YAN ZHAO

Abstract. Catanese and Tonoli showed that the maximal cardinality for an even set of nodes on a
sextic surface is 56 and they constructed such nodal surfaces. In this paper we give an alternative, rather
simple, construction for these surfaces starting from a non-hyperelliptic genus three curve. We illustrate
our method by giving explicitly the equation of such a sextic surface starting from the Klein curve.

Introduction

A nodal surface is a projective surface with only ordinary double points as singularities. A set of nodes of
a surface F is said to be even if there is a double cover S → F branched exactly in the nodes from that
set. In [CT07], Catanese and Tonoli showed that an even set of nodes on a sextic surface has cardinality
in {24, 32, 40, 56}. They also provided a construction of such 56 nodal surfaces, constructions for the other
cases were already known. Their method is based on the paper [CC97], where it is shown that even sets
of nodes correspond to certain symmetric maps between vector bundles. A careful study of the sheaves
involved leads to certain matrices whose entries are homogeneous polynomials on P3. The points in P3
where such a matrix has rank less than 6 is a sextic surface with an even set of 56 nodes. In this way, one
can ﬁnd explicit examples of such surfaces, but the equations tend to be rather complicated and it is not
easy to understand the geometry of these surfaces.

Let F be a 56 nodal surface as constructed in [CT07] and let f : S → F be the double cover which is
branched exactly over the nodes of F . The ﬁrst Betti number of the smooth surface S is equal to 6,
hence S has a 3-dimensional Albanese variety. With some trial and error, we then found the following
construction for 56 nodal surfaces. A principally polarized abelian threefold A has a theta divisor Θ,
deﬁning the polarization, which can be taken to be symmetric, so [−1]Θ = Θ. The ﬁxed points of [−1]
are the two-torsion points. There are exactly 28 such points on Θ precisely in the case that (A, Θ) is the
Jacobian of a non-hyperelliptic genus three curve. Assume that we are in this case. Then Θ = Θ/[−1]
has 28 nodes. This singular surface has been studied before, cf. [DO88, Chapter IX.6, Theorem 4 and
Remark 6]. In particular it has an embedding into P6 where it is a Cartier divisor in a cone over a Veronese
surface. This cone is the quotient of P3 by an involution which changes the sign of one of the homogeneous
coordinates. The inverse image of Θ in P3 is then a sextic surface F with an even set of 56 nodes, as we
show in Section 1.

By construction, F has an involution with quotient Θ. This involution lifts to S and together with the
covering involution of the map S → F generates a subgroup (Z/2Z)2 of Aut(S). In Section 2 we study the
cohomology of the quotients of S. We also show there that our construction and the one from Catanese
and Tonoli produce the same surfaces.
In the last section we give an explicit example, with a simple
equation, of such a surface.

1. Construction of a family of 56 nodal sextic surfaces

Let C be a smooth non-hyperelliptic curve of genus 3 and consider its Jacobian A = Jac(C). The abelian
variety A admits a principal polarization deﬁned by the theta divisor Θ and we will identify Θ = S2C.
We can choose Θ to be a symmetric divisor on A, i.e. [−1]∗Θ = Θ. The involution [−1] on Θ corresponds
to the involution D 7→ KC − D on S2C, where KC is the canonical divisor on C.
The linear system |2Θ| is totally symmetric, and deﬁnes a morphism

which is the quotient map by the involution [−1]. Let A ∼= A/[−1], the Kummer variety of A, be the image
of ϕ2Θ. The singular locus of A consists of 64 nodes, these are the images of the two-torsion points of A.

ϕ2Θ : A −→ P7

1

Consider the hyperplane H2Θ of P7 corresponding to the divisor 2Θ. The intersection of H2Θ with A is
the image Θ ∼= Θ/[−1] of Θ, with multiplicity two. As Θ contains 28 of the two-torsion points of A, the
surface Θ has 28 nodes. Equivalently, these are the images of the 28 odd theta characteristics in S2C.
To describe this map ϕ2Θ|Θ : Θ → P6, notice that the adjunction formula on A shows that the canonical
class of Θ is KΘ = Θ|Θ. Thus OΘ(2Θ) ∼= ω⊗2

Θ . Moreover, the cohomology of the restriction sequence

0 −→ OA(Θ) −→ OA(2Θ) −→ OΘ(2Θ) −→ 0

combined with H i(A,OA(Θ)) = 0 for i > 0 (Kodaira vanishing or Riemann- Roch on A), shows that
h0(ω⊗2
Θ ) = h0(OΘ(2Θ)) = 7. Hence, when restricted to Θ, the morphism ϕ2Θ|Θ = ϕ2KΘ is given by the
complete linear system |2KΘ|.
To understand this morphism better, we ﬁrst consider the map ϕKΘ . From the restriction sequence
above, twisted by OA(−Θ), one deduces that H 0(Θ, ωΘ) ∼= H 1(A,OA) is three dimensional. The map
ϕKΘ : Θ → P2 is the Gauss map, which is a morphism of degree (Θ|Θ)2 = Θ3 = 6 which factors over
Θ. As ϕKΘ is surjective, the natural map S2H 0(Θ, ωΘ) → H 0(Θ, ω⊗2
Θ ) is injective, thus the image has
codimension one.
Let t ∈ H 0(Θ, ω⊗2
Θ ) be a general section in the complement of the image of S2H 0(Θ, ωΘ). Since |2Θ| is
basepoint free, we may assume that the divisor B in Θ deﬁned by t = 0 is smooth and does not pass through
any two-torsion points. Since |2Θ| is totally symmetric, any divisor in this linear system is symmetric,
that is, [−1]B = B. Let s0, . . . , s2 be a basis of H 0(Θ, ωΘ). Then we have:

ϕ2KΘ : Θ −→ PH 0(Θ, ω⊗2

Θ ) ∼= H2Θ ∼= P6 ,

x 7−→ (. . . : si(x)sj (x) : . . . : t(x))0≤i≤j≤2 .

The image Θ of Θ thus lies in a cone over the Veronese surface of P2. This cone is the image Y of the
weighted projective 3-space P(1, 1, 1, 2), which is embedded into P6 by the (very) ample generator OY (1)
of its Picard group:

P(1, 1, 1, 2) −→ Y ⊂ P6,

(y0 : y1 : y2 : y3) 7−→ (. . . : yiyj : . . . : y3)0≤i≤j≤2 .

As ϕKΘ has no base points, the surface Θ ⊂ Y does not contain the singular point v = (0 : . . . : 0 : 1) of
Y , the vertex of the cone over the Veronese surface. Hence, Θ is a Cartier divisor on Y . The projection
of Θ from v onto the Veronese surface is the Gauss map ϕKΘ , which has degree 6/2 = 3 on Θ. This
implies that Θ lies in the linear system on Y deﬁned by three times the ample generator. Since the map
S3H 0(Y,OY (1)) → H 0(Y,OY (3)) is surjective, we conclude that Θ is deﬁned by a weighted homogeneous
polynomial p of degree six in Y = P(1, 1, 1, 2):

Θ = {(y0 : y1 : y2 : y3) ∈ P(1, 1, 1, 2) : p(y0, . . . , y3) =

3

Xi=0

p2i(y0, y1, y2)y3−i

3 = 0 } ,

where each p2i is homogeneous of degree 2i in y0, y1, y2. Since v 6∈ Θ, we may and will assume that p0 = 1.
The weighted projective space P(1, 1, 1, 2) is also the quotient of P3 by the involution i3 : (x0 : . . . : x3) 7→
(x0 : x1 : x2 : −x3), the quotient map is explicitly given by:

p : P3 −→ P(1, 1, 1, 2),

(x0 : x1 : x2 : x3) 7−→ (. . . : xixj : . . . : x2

3)0≤i≤j≤2 .

Now we deﬁne a surface F in P3 as F := p−1(Θ), thus F is deﬁned by the sextic equation P = 0 where

P := p6(x0, x1, x2) + p4(x0, x1, x2)x2

3 + p2(x0, x1, x2)x4

3 + x6
3 .

The double cover p : F → Θ is branched over the points where x3 = 0, so the branch locus is the divisor
B ⊂ Θ deﬁned by t = 0. Here B = B/[−1], which is a smooth curve since by assumption B is smooth
and does not pass through the 28 ﬁxed points of [−1] in Θ. Hence the singular locus of F consists of 56
nodes. The 28 nodes of Θ form an even set since the double cover Θ → Θ is branched only over the nodes.
Hence the preimage ∆ ⊂ F of these nodes is also an even set, cf. diagram 1, in fact F has a double cover
S branched only over the nodes by pulling back the double cover Θ → Θ along p : F → Θ.
We summarize the construction as follows:

Theorem 1.1. There exists a family of 56 nodal sextic surfaces with the nodes forming an even set, which
is parametrized by pairs (C, B) where C is a non-hyperelliptic curve of genus 3 and B ∈ |2KS 2C| is a
general divisor. In particular, we have a 6 + 6 = 12 dimensional family of such surfaces. Moreover, each
surface in the family has an automorphism of order two.

2. Coverings of Θ

First of all, we provide another construction of the double cover f : S → F branched over the set ∆ of
56 nodes of F . Let πF : ˜F → F be a minimal resolution of singularities and let Ni ⊂ ˜F be the inverse
image of the node pi ∈ F . Since the nodes form an even set, the divisor ˜∆ = P56
i=1 Ni is even, that is,
it is 2-divisible in Pic( ˜F ). Thus ˜F admits a smooth double cover ˜f : ˜S → ˜F branched along ˜∆. Let
Ei = ˜f −1(Ni), so ˜f ∗Ni = 2Ei. Since pi are nodes, the exceptional curves Ni are (−2)-curves, so

Ei · Ei =

1
4

˜f ∗Ni · ˜f ∗Ni =

˜f ∗(Ni · Ni) = −1

2

and Ei are (−1)-curves. The surface S can be obtained by blowing down this set of (−1)-curves on the
smooth surface ˜S, so it is also smooth and it is a double cover of F , giving a commutative diagram

/ F .

From the deﬁnition of S as the base change along p : F → Θ of the double cover Θ → Θ, it follows that
the covering S → Θ is a (Z/2Z)2-covering. Let ι1 and ι2 be involutions on S with quotient surface F and
Θ respectively. Let ι3 = ι1ι2, then ι3 is an involution and we deﬁne T := S/ι3.

This gives a commutative diagram

Proposition 2.1. The double cover S → T is unramiﬁed. In particular, T is smooth and T → Θ is
branched along B and the 28 nodes.

Proof. The ramiﬁcation locus of S → T is the ﬁxed locus R3 of ι3, which is precisely the points s ∈ S
such that ι3 ∈ Stab(Z/2Z)2(s). The ﬁxed loci of ι1 and ι2 are f −1∆ and p−1B respectively. Since the
branch curve B does not contain any of the 28 two-torsion points on Θ, the intersection of the ﬁxed loci
f −1∆ ∩ p−1B = ∅. Hence, there are no points s ∈ S such that Stab(Z/2Z)2(s) = (Z/2Z)2. In particular,
R3 = {s ∈ S|Stab(Z/2Z)2(s) = hι3i} is disjoint from f −1∆ ∪ p−1B. Since the ramiﬁcation locus of S → Θ
is precisely the union of that of f and p, we conclude that R3 = ∅ and S → T is unramiﬁed.

We now consider the Hodge numbers of the surfaces in diagram 1.
Proposition 2.2. The smooth surfaces Θ, S, T and ˜F have Hodge numbers:

Proof. The cohomologies of OΘ are computed using the short exact sequence

0 −→ OA(−Θ) −→ OA −→ OΘ −→ 0 .

Since Θ is ample on A and KA = 0, hi(OA(−Θ)) = 0 for i < 3 by Kodaira vanishing and, using Serre
duality, h3(OA(−Θ)) = h0(OA(Θ)) = 1 since Θ is a principal polarization. Moreover, hi(OA) = (3
i ), hence
h1,0(Θ) = h1(OΘ) = 3 and h2,0(Θ) = 3. As
χtop(Θ) = 2 − 4h1,0(Θ) + 2h2,0(Θ) + h1,1(Θ) = 2 − 12 + 6 + h1,1(Θ) = h1,1(Θ) − 4 ,

we can compute h1,1(Θ) from Noether’s formula

χ(OΘ) =

χtop(Θ) + K 2
Θ

12

⇒ h1,1(Θ) = 12χ(OΘ) − K 2

Θ + 4 = 12 − 6 + 4 = 10 .

For the double cover p : S → Θ, branched over the divisor B, there is an isomorphism

p∗OS = OΘ ⊕ L−1,

L ∼= ωΘ ,

so L⊗2 = OΘ(B). Thus hi,0(S) = hi(OΘ) + hi(L−1). As L = ωΘ is ample, by Kodaira vanishing we get
hi(L−1) = 0 for i < 2. Hence, by Riemann-Roch

h2(L−1) = χ(ω−1

Θ ) = χ(OΘ) +

KΘ · (KΘ + KΘ)

= 7 .

On the canonical bundles, we have an isomorphism ωS = p∗(ωΘ ⊗ L). Thus, K 2
and we obtain h1,1(S) = 38 by Noether’s formula.
The blowup πS : ˜S → S at 56 points does not change h1,0 and h2,0, and h1,1( ˜S) = h1,1(S) + 56.
Since πF : ˜F → F is a blowup at isolated rational singularities, we have hi(O ˜F ) = hi(OF ). The latter can
be computed using the short exact sequence

S = p∗(2KΘ)2 = 8K 2

Θ = 48

0 −→ OP3(−6) −→ OP3 −→ OF −→ 0 .

Since the singularity is canonical, we have ω ˜F = π∗
adjunction formula. Thus, K 2
˜F
h1,1( ˜F ) = 86.

FOP3(2)|F by the
= (O(2)|F · O(2)|F ) = 2 · 2 · 6 = 24. By Noether’s formula, we obtain

F (ωP3 ⊗ OP3 (F ))|F = π∗

F ωF = π∗

Finally, we use the eigenspace decomposition of the cohomologies on S to compute the Hodge numbers of
T . Let G = (Z/2Z)2. The G-action on S induces a decomposition
H i(S,OS)χ

H i(S,OS) = Mχ∈G∗

where G∗ = {1, χ1, χ2, χ3} is the character group and χi is chosen such that, if Hi is the stabilizer of ιi,
then G∗

|Hi

= {1, χi}. Hence,

hi(OF ) = hi(OS)1 + hi(OS)χ1 ,

hi(OΘ) = hi(OS)1 + hi(OS)χ2 ,

hi(OT ) = hi(OS)1 + hi(OS)χ3 .

From the Hodge numbers h1,0 and h2,0 of S, T and ˜F (notice hi,0(F ) = hi,0( ˜F )), we obtain that

h1,0(S)χ =(3 χ = χ2,
0 χ 6= χ2,

and

h2,0(S)χ =


3 χ = 1,
7 χ = χ1,
0 χ = χ2, χ3 .

Hence, h1,0(T ) = 0 and h2,0(T ) = 3. Since S → T is an unramiﬁed double cover, we have an equality
χtop(S) = 2χtop(T ). This allows us to compute h1,1(T ) = 16.

(cid:3)

A consequence of the fact that we have a morphism p : S → Θ and h1,0(S) = h1,0(Θ), is that the Albanese
map of S factors over the Albanese map for Θ, which is just the inclusion Θ ֒→ A, hence A = Alb(S).
We now deduce that the 12 dimensional family of 56 nodal sextics we constructed coincides with the family
constructed by Catanese and Tonoli in [CT07, Main Theorem B]. Notice that they obtain a 27 dimensional
subvariety of the space of sextic surfaces parametrizing 56 nodal sextics, but modulo the action of Aut(P3)
one again ﬁnds a 27 − 15 = 12 dimensional family. We were not able to relate their construction to ours.
However, when using their Macaulay scripts (which can be found in the eprint arXiv:math/0510499) we
noticed that it does produce sextics which are invariant under the involution x0 7→ −x0 in P3.
Corollary 2.3. The family of sextics with an even set of 56 nodes from [CT07, Main Theorem B] coincides
with the family constructed in Theorem 1.1.

Proof. For a double cover f : S → F of a 56 nodal sextic surface F , branched exactly over the nodes of F ,
the ‘quadratic’ sheaf F on F deﬁned by f∗OS = OF ⊕F must satisfy (τ, a) = (3, 3) or (τ, a) = (3, 4), where
2τ = h1(F,F (1)) and a = h1(F,F ), cf. [CT07, Theorem 2.5]. The family constructed in [CT07] is the one
with invariants (τ, a) = (3, 3). For our surfaces we have h1,0(S) = h1(F, f∗OS) = h1(F,OF ) + h1(F,F ) so
we get h1(F,F ) = 3, which shows that they are in the same family.

3. An explicit example

Let C be a non-hyperelliptic genus three curve, we will also denote the canonical model of C, a quartic
curve in P2, by C. Recall that Θ = S2C, the symmetric product of C.

We show how to ﬁnd the global sections H 0(Θ, ω⊗2
Θ ) in terms of the geometry of C, following [BV96].
Note that if we map S2C → Jac(C) by p + q 7→ p + q − t where t ∈ S2C is an odd theta characteristic
(so 2t ≡ KC ), then the image of S2C is a symmetric theta divisor. Let d = z1 + . . . + z4 be an eﬀective
canonical divisor on C, D = P(zi + C) be the corresponding divisor on S2C and ∆ be the diagonal in
S2C. Then, 2KS 2C = 2D − ∆. By [BV96, Lemma 4.7], we have the restriction sequence
0 −→ OS 2C (2KS 2C ) −→ OS 2C (2D) −→ O∆(2D) ∼= OC (4d) −→ 0 .

where µ is the multiplication map. Note that h0(C, ω⊗2

Let σ0, . . . , σ2 be a basis of H 0(C, ωC ). It induces a basis σi ⊗ σj of H 0(C2, ωC 2) = H 0(C, ωC )⊗2. The
sections of H 0(Θ, ωΘ) ∼= ∧2H 0(C, ωC ) deﬁne the Gauss map S2C ∼= Θ → P2. Explicitly, the Gauss map
is induced by the map

C ) = 6, so dim S2H 0(C, ω⊗2

S 2C ) = 7.

C × C −→ P2,

(x, y) 7−→ (p12 : p13 : p23),

pij(x, y) := σi(x)σj (y) − σj (x)σi(y) .

The six products pijpkl span a six dimensional subspace of ker(µ) which is the image of S2H 0(Θ, ωΘ) in
H 0(Θ, ω⊗2

Θ ).

Let f (z) be a homogeneous quartic polynomial in C[z0, z1, z2] such that f (σ0(x), σ1(x), σ2(x)) = 0 for
all x ∈ C, that is, f deﬁnes the curve C ⊂ P2. Choose any polynomial g(u, v) of bidegree (2, 2)
in C[u0, u1, u2, v0, v1, v2] such that g(z, z) = f (z) and let gs(u, v) := g(u, v) + g(v, u), then ˜g(x, y) :=
gs(σ0(x), . . . , σ2(y)) ∈ S2H 0(C, ω⊗2
C ) and lies in ker(µ). Thus the choice of ˜g provides the section t used
to construct the map ϕ2KΘ , any other choice of ˜g is of the form λ˜g +P λij pij for complex numbers λ, λij
with λ 6= 0.
The map ϕ2KΘ : Θ → P6 is therefore induced by the map

A homogeneous polynomial P in seven variables is an equation for the image of this map if
P (. . . , pij(u, v)pkl(u, v), . . . , ˜g(u, v)) lies in the ideal of C[u0, . . . , v2] generated by f (u) and f (v).

An explicit example, worked out using the computer program Magma [BCP97], is provided by the choice

f = z0z3

and the map ϕ2KΘ is given by:

0, which deﬁnes the Klein curve in P2. We will take g = u0u1v2

1 + u1u2v2

2 + z2z3

1 + z1z3

One of the equations for the image is

(y00 : y01 : . . . : y22 : yg) = (cid:0)p2

g

(this equation thus deﬁnes the image in P(1, 1, 1, 2) ⊂ P6). Next we pull this equation back to P3 along
the map p by substituting yij = xixj and yg = x2
3, moreover we change the sign of x1 in order to simplify
the equation and we obtain

Q := x5

The singular locus of the surface F deﬁned by Q = 0 consists of 56 nodes and these are thus an even
set of nodes. To ﬁnd all the nodes, we observe that Aut(F ) contains a subgroup G336 of order 336 with
generators

where ω is a primitive seventh root of unity. One of the nodes is (1 : 1 : 1 : 1) and G336 acts transitively
on the 56 nodes, the stabilizer of a node is isomorphic to the symmetric group S3. The covering involution
diag(1, 1, 1,−1) generates the center of G336 and G336 ∼= {±1} × G168 where G168 ∼= SL(3, F2) is the
automorphism group of the Klein curve. The equation of F can be written as p6+p4x2
3, the discriminant
of the cubic polynomial p6 + p4T − T 3 has degree 12 in C[x0, x1, x2] and the curve it deﬁnes is the dual of
the Klein curve (as expected from the presence of the Gauss map).
