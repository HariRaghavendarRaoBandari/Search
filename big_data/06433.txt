Abstract

This technical report describes an improved image mosaicking algorithm. It is based on Jain’s
logarithmic search algorithm [Jain and Jain, 1981] which is coupled to the method of Kourogi
et al. [1999] for matching images in a video sequence. Logarithmic search has a better invariance
against illumination changes than the original optical-ﬂow-based method of Kourogi.

1 Introduction

1.1 Related work

Many algorithms on image mosaicking are known, however only relatively few of them can work fully
automatic, e.g.
[Kourogi et al., 1999; Szeliski, 1994; Seshamani et al., 2006; Robinson, 2003] and
under real-time conditions [Kourogi et al., 1999; Seshamani et al., 2006; Robinson, 2003]. Except for
Seshamani et al. [2006] they have not yet been applied to endoscopic video.

A problem with Kourogi’s method [Kourogi et al., 1999; Konen et al., 2007a,b] is its dependence
on illumination conditions. It is a common condition of endoscopic video sequences that the light
source moves together with the camera so that the illumination of a certain patch will vary with its
location in the ﬁeld of view. The logarithmic search method [Jain and Jain, 1981; Lundmark, 2001]
is a fast search method based on normalized cross-correlation and thus very robust against overall
intensity diﬀerences or against slowly varying gradients. This report describes a synthesis between
logarithmic search and Kourogi’s algorithm.

The normalized cross correlation is a robust measure to quantify the similarity between two image
patches (or templates) A and B. In the most simple form, these patches can be rectangular areas
within images, but irregular shapes are possible as well. The normalized cross correlation is deﬁned
as

(cid:80)
((cid:80)
m,n(Amn − ¯A)2)((cid:80)
m,n(Amn − ¯A)(Bmn − ¯B)

(cid:113)

CL(A, B) =

m,n(Bmn − ¯B)2)

(1)

where ¯A and ¯B are the average intensities of patch A and B, resp. Due to average subtraction and
normalization to the variance of both patches, the measure CL is invariant against global intensity
or contrast changes and only weakly aﬀected by a slowly varying intensity gradient. The correlation
coeﬃcient CL is in the range [−1, 1].

2.2 Logarithmic search

Logarithmic search [Jain and Jain, 1981] is an improvement over naive template search. If the search
area is a square of side length 2w, then a naive template search requires 4w2 cross correlation mea-
surements. The logarithmic search instead forms a cross with cross bar length w and either shifts
this cross or halves the cross bar until it reaches w = 1. Fig. 1 shows an example where the cross
is ﬁrst shifted to the right, then down, where it ﬁnds the best correlation in the center of the cross.
Therefore the cross bar length w is halved, and the search continues with the smaller cross. It is easy
to see that the complexity of this approach is only 5(ld(w) + S) where S is the number of times we
have to shift the cross, which is usually a small number.1 The complexity reduction from O(w2) to
O(ld(w)) is the reason for the name

Algorithm 1 describes logarithmic search in detail. Usually template A will be a square, but other

shapes are possible as well. Template B has to have the same shape and size as A.
”
A at location (x, y)“ in line 2 means that the center location of the square is at (x, y). Similar for
template B in line 6. The initial size winit is usually a power of 2, so that every division by 2 in line
9 yields again an integer value.

logarithmic search“.
”

If the cross correlation function CL(A, B) is convex in the search area, logarithmic search is guar-
anteed to converge to the correct (and more costly to compute) solution of the naive template search.

2.3 Kourogi’s pseudo motion method

The pseudo motion algorithm according to Kourogi et al. [1999] – based on the seminal work of Horn
and Schunck [1981] on optical ﬂow – is described in more detail in Konen [2009] (in German) and in
Konen et al. [2007a,b]. It estimates a compensated motion vector ﬁeld (uc, vc) for each pixel in the
image. Usually it starts with a compensated motion equal to (0, 0) at each pixel and ﬁlls in a dense
compensated motion ﬁeld through a loop of iterations.

For reference, we describe this algorithm in a nutshell as follows: The goal of the improved optical
ﬂow algorithm according to Kourogi et al. [1999] is to estimate the motion ﬁeld between successive

1Instead of a 5-point cross it is equally well possible to use a 9-point neighborhood (including self).

where Ix and Iy denote the spatial gradient and (uc, vc) is the so-called compensated motion at this
pixel location. I(x, y, t) is the luminance signal at pixel (x, y) in frame t. Our algorithm proceeds as
follows: Initially we start with (uc, vc) = 0 or with an estimate from the previous frame. Then the
following steps are carried out in a loop:

(A) Calculate the pseudo motion (up, vp) according to Eq. (2) for each pixel inside the endoscopic

mask.

(B) Accept only those pixel which fulﬁll the following criteria: (a) Ix and Iy are not 0, (b) (x + up, y +
vp) is inside the endoscopic mask and (c) |I(x + up, y + vp, t) − I(x, y, t − 1)| < T . Here, T is a
suitable gray level threshold, e. g. T = 5.

(C) Find the aﬃne parameters (cid:126)a = {a1, . . . , a6} for a global motion ﬁeld best-ﬁtting the pseudo

motion at all accepted pixel locations i, i. e. solve the overdetermined system of equations

a1xi + a2yi + a3 = up,i
a4xi + a5yi + a6 = vp,i

in a least-squares sense.2 The solution (cid:126)a from Eq. (3) gives a new estimate for (uc, vc)

uc(xi, yi) = a1xi + a2yi + a3
vc(xi, yi) = a4xi + a5yi + a6

(3)

(4)

(D) Continue with step (A) using the new compensated motion vector ﬁeld (uc, vc).

The loop is terminated either after a ﬁxed number of iterations or when the change in the global
motion ﬁeld drops below a certain threshold.

In contrast to that, the pseudo motion method based on logarithmic search, which will be described
next, is a single-pass algorithm (no iterations). It calculates the precise pseudo motion vectors only
for a set of landmarks, not for all pixel.

2It is also possible to use instead of the 6-parameter aﬃne transformation the 8-parameter projective transformation,

if the image material requires this wider class of transformations.

Algorithm 2 describes the new pseudo motion method in detail. Step 2 is an initial estimate of

the compensated motion. Several possibilities for such an estimate exist:

1. Initialize (uc, vc) = 0 for every pixel.
2. Initialize (uc, vc) with the compensated motion from the previous frame according to Eq. (4).
3. Call Kourogi’s method for a small number of iterations to get an initial estimate of (uc, vc).3
In any way, we start with an initial estimate for (uc, vc) and deﬁne a set of N landmarks. We use
in line 6 the logarithmic search method to relocate the landmarks in the object image, starting from
the displacement given by (uc, vc).

In order to select only reliable landmarks, there is a two-stage ﬁlter in lines 9-19 of Algorithm 2:

(1) First we eliminate all landmarks with ﬁnal correlation coeﬃcient below a threshold, CL < cmin.
We have however a request for a minimum of aminN landmarks in total. If there are not enough
landmarks above threshold, we take the aminN landmarks with highest CL.

(2) Based on the landmarks accepted in the ﬁrst stage, we recalculate (uc, vc) with the help of Eq. (3)
and Eq. (4). We now measure for each landmark the Euclidean distance between its displacement
vector (up, vp) and its compensated motion (uc, vc). Outliers (landmarks having a distance larger
than emax) are discarded. Again, care is taken to retain at least aminN landmarks.
The ﬁnally accepted landmarks in M(cid:48)(cid:48) are the basis for the least-squares estimate of transformation

(cid:126)a.

3To avoid any instabilities in this initialization method, we usually restrict Kourogi’s method to the class of purely

translational transformations.

Figure 2: Examples of image mosaicking results [Konen et al., 2007b; Liebig et al., 2014].

Given the resulting transformation (cid:126)a from algorithm PMotionLog, the object image is now
warped into the reference image frame. If there is a whole video sequence, these steps are repeated in
a loop and step-by-step an image mosaic is formed.

The actual implementation is a little bit more complicated, since only a certain masked area of the
image frame contains pixel from the endoscopic view. Furthermore, valid locations (u, v) for template
A in the reference or template B in the object image are only those locations where these templates
are fully inside the masked area. Those valid locations are computed beforehand with the help of
suitable erosion operators.

3 Results

Fig. 2 shows some image mosaicking results. The left image is an early result with Kourogi’s method
from Konen et al. [2007b] (CARS conference), based on an neuroendoscopic videos from an older
Wolf endoscope. The right image is from the more recent study of Liebig et al. [2014] where a Storz
endoscope with better lighting and better image quality was available. Here the logarithmic search
algorithm is used. A clear improvement in quality is visible. For details the reader is referred to the
relevant publications [Konen et al., 2007b; Liebig et al., 2014].

4 Discussion

Advantages of pseudo motion based on logarithmic search:

• It is invariant against local intensity and local contrast changes in the images.
• A good match is well recognizable by its high correlation coeﬃcient CL.
• Localization is usually more precise than with the pixel-based method of Kourogi. (Problems
with the pixel-based method of Kourogi are: (a) the gray level of a pixel can ﬁt at multiple
places; (b) it may not ﬁt at the correct place because the overall intensity in both images is
diﬀerent.)

• It avoids the problematic acceptance test in step (B) of Kourogi’s method (see Sec. 2.3).

5

• It is suﬃcient to match a small set of landmarks. (In principle, 3 landmarks would be suﬃcient to
estimate the 6 parameters of (cid:126)a. For more robust operation in practical applications, we usually
take 10-20 landmarks, which is still considerable less than the number of pixels.) A small set
of landmarks allows fast calculation although the individual logarithmic search method is more
costly than the pixel acceptance test.

• Most importantly, there is no loop with 10-30 iterations as in Kourogi’s method. It was found
that for diﬃcult image pairs (large distortions or diﬃcult lighting conditions), these iterations
may cause divergent solutions (e. g. with unrealistically large scale factors). In contrast to that,
logarithmic search is considerably more stable.

Disadvantages of pseudo motion based on logarithmic search:

• It is not applicable to (larger) rotations. But in video images there are usually no large rotations

from frame to frame.

• Cross correlation accuracy decreases if there is a larger scale factor between two images to be

matched. But scale factors up to 10-15% will be usually tolerated.

• It does not calculate a dense pseudo motion ﬁeld (up, vp) as Kourogi’s method does. Instead,
(up, vp) is only calculated for the accepted landmarks. Thus it cannot express the discontinuities
in motion ﬁelds as they appear in images from natural scenes when a nearer object with sharp
boundaries moves in front of a more distant background. But it was found that endoscopic
video sequences often do not exhibit such discontinuities, because the near-far-transition is of-
ten gradually. This is of course only a ﬁrst approximation, and there might be other endoscopic
applications, where a 3D reconstruction of nearby objects is necessary to create visually accept-
able image mosaics. But for a ﬁrst approach where the image mosaic gives the surgeon some
orientation in the scene, it might be more important to have an algorithm which works fast and
robustly. This holds for the logarithmic search method.

Logarithmic search was also used for tracking landmarks in neuroendoscopic video sequences [Ko-
nen et al., 1997; Scholz et al., 1998; Konen et al., 1998; Scholz et al., 2005]. Logarithmic search
was found to work robustly and a tracking error of 0.7 mm could be obtained [Konen et al., 1997].
Tracking operates at 8 frames per second and thus can be performed under real-time conditions in
the operating theatre.

Besides its applications in neuroendoscopy, logarithmic search was also applied with very good
success to image stabilization of facial video sequences in the diploma thesis of Bloemendal [2009] (in
German). It was shown that it operates reliable enough to allow super-resolution.4

A survey of more work on image processing in neuroendoscopy is found in Konen [2016].

5 Conclusion

This technical report presented a short introduction into the logarithmic search algorithm for image
mosaics. A few iterations of Kourogi’s algorithm were used to initialize the motion ﬁeld, but the central
motion ﬁeld estimation with logarithmic search requires no iterations. In a variety of applications
[Bloemendal, 2009; Liebig, 2011; Liebig et al., 2014] it was shown to operate robustly and fast.

The PhD thesis of Liebig [2011] and the paper Liebig et al. [2014] investigated image mosaics
based on Kourogi’s algorithm and on the logarithmic search method in neuroendoscopy under clinical
conditions. With large image sizes (720x576 pixels) and color image processing, a frame rate of 3-4
fps could be established. Three clinical observers graded the quality of the image mosaic in terms of
usefulness for surgery. It was found that the logarithmic search method showed signiﬁcantly better
results than Kourogi’s method. The logarithmic search method was reliable in operation and provided
higher-quality mosaics. There is however a need for faster frame rates to create a smooth panorama
image for practical use during surgery.

4A super-resolution image provides more image detail than each image of the original image sequence.
