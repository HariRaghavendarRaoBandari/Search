ABSTRACT

Aims. The non-thermal spectra of jetted active galactic nuclei (AGN) show a variety of shapes and degree of curvature
in their low- and high energy components. From some of the brightest Fermi-LAT blazars, prominent spectral breaks
at a few GeV have been regularly detected, which is inconsistent with conventional cooling eﬀects. We study the eﬀects
of continuous time-dependent injection of electrons into the jet with diﬀering rates, durations, locations, and power-law
spectral indices, and evaluate its impact on the ambient emitting particle spectrum that is observed at a given snapshot
time in the framework of a leptonic blazar emission model. With this study, we provide a basis for analyzing ambient
electron spectra in terms of injection requirements, with implications for particle acceleration modes.
Methods. The emitting electron spectrum is calculated by Compton cooling the continuously injected electrons, where
target photons are assumed to be provided by the accretion disk and broad line region (BLR). From this setup, we
calculate the non-thermal photon spectra produced by inverse Compton scattering of these external target radiation
ﬁelds using the full Compton cross-section in the head-on approximation.
Results. By means of a comprehensive parameter study we present the resulting ambient electron and photon spectra,
and discuss the inﬂuence of each injection parameter individually. We found that varying the injection parameters has a
notable inﬂuence on the spectral shapes, which in turn can be used to set interesting constraints on the particle injection
scenarios. By applying our model to the ﬂare state spectral energy distribution (SED) of 3C 454.3, we conﬁrm a previous
suggestion that explained the observed spectral changes at a few GeV by a combination of the Compton-scattered disk
and BLR radiation. We determine the required injection parameters for this scenario. We also show that this spectral
turn-over can also be understood as Compton-scattered BLR radiation only, and provide the corresponding injection
parameters. Here the spectral turn-over is explained by a corresponding break in the ambient electron spectrum. In a
similar way, we also applied our model to the FSRQ PKS 1510-089, and present two possible model ﬁts. Here, the GeV-
spectrum is either dominated by Compton-scattered accretion disk radiation or is a combination of Compton-scattered
disk and BLR radiation. We provide the required injection parameters for these ﬁts. In all four scenarios, we found that
impulsive particle injection is disfavored.
Conclusions. The presented injection model that is embedded in a leptonic blazar emission model for external Compton-
loss dominated jets of AGN aims towards bridging jet emission with acceleration models using a phenomenological
approach. Blazar spectral data can be analyzed with this model to constrain injection parameters, in addition to the
conventional parameter values of steady-state emission models, if suﬃcient broad multifrequency coverage is provided.

1. Introduction

Jetted active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) comprise the most nu-
merous variable source population in the γ-ray sky (e.g.,
Ackermann et al. 2013). Their jets are considered as the
site of intense broadband emission, with apparently ran-
dom ﬂaring events, shich cover the electromagnetic band
from the radio up to GeV, or TeV energies. Variability
timescales for this continuum emission range from months
(radio) down to few minutes (TeV). Their broadband spec-
tral energy distribution (SED) can be described as having
two broad components, with the lower energy component
usually attributed to synchrotron radiation from a popula-
tion of relativistic electrons in the magnetized emission re-
gion. The origin of the photons of the higher energy compo-
nent is still under debate, and strongly depends on the rela-
tivistic particle content of the jet (e.g., Reimer & B¨ottcher
2013). In many cases, it is only by considering leptonic pro-
cesses together with external target photon ﬁelds that can

lead to snapshot or time-averaged SEDs that are in agree-
ment with the corresponding multifrequency observations
(e.g., B¨ottcher et al. 2013). An often used approach for cal-
culating these SEDs is based on an ad hoc assumption of the
emitting electron spectrum as having log-parabolic shapes,
(broken) power laws with possible exponential cutoﬀs, and
with the minimum and maximum electron energies, energy
of possible breaks and power law indices or curvature of
this spectrum as free parameters (e.g., Dermer et al. 2009,
Finke & Dermer 2010, Dermer et al. 2014).

The observation of spectral breaks in the high en-
ergy photon spectra of bright ﬂat spectrum radio quasars
(FSRQ) was among the ﬁrst ﬁndings of the Fermi-
LAT in the extragalactic γ-ray sky (Abdo et al. 2009,
2010d, and conﬁrmed subsequently in Ackermann et al.
2011). Typically, bright FSRQs (and also some low fre-
quency peaked-BL Lacs (LBLs) and intermediate frequency
peaked-BL Lacs (IBLs)) show γ-ray spectra that can be de-

scribed phenomenologically either by broken power laws or
log-parabolas with strong concave curvature (Harris et al.,
2014) between 1 and 10 GeV, which is too low to be caused
by absorption in the extragalactic background light (e.g.,
Abdo et al. 2010c), and with a power-law index change
much larger than expected from cooling (∆Γ = 0.5). For ex-
ample, the turn-over in the GeV spectra of FSRQ 3C 454.3
is located at ∼ 2.5 GeV with a power law index change of
about ∆Γ = 1.1 ± 0.1. The break energy does not seem to
be correlated with the γ-ray luminosity. Several scenarios
have been proposed to explain these breaks. These range
from photon pair production in the broad-line region of the
source (BLR; Poutanen & Stern 2010), to a two-component
γ-ray spectrum (Finke & Dermer 2010), or GeV breaks in
the photon spectra owing to corresponding breaks in the
electron spectra (Abdo et al. 2010d).

Some recent studies, however, have cast doubt on
the internal absorption scenario, which would predict
well-deﬁned break energies in the AGN’s source frame.
Harris et al. (2012) did not ﬁnd such universal values of
the break energies. Kohler & Nalewajko (2015) described
the occurence of spectral breaks, which were investigated
from a set of 40 bright LAT-blazars as “random”. In
fact they report a tendency for short duration ﬂares to
possess stronger curvature than those hat are integrated
over a longer timescale. The other two non-absorption sce-
narios mentioned above invoke ad hoc broken power-law
particle spectra. Ghisellini & Tavecchio (2009) show that
Klein-Nishina or simple cooling eﬀects cannot explain the
strength and shape of the observed peaks (see however,
Cerruti et al. (2013) who propose a high-energy cutoﬀ at
GeV energies from Klein-Nishina eﬀects in scattering Lyα
photons).

Using the ambient particle spectrum as an input param-
eter, however, broadly ignores the build-up of this emitting
particle spectrum that is impacted by the various particle
energy losses, and gains through particle energization mech-
anisms which, in general, requires a time-dependent treat-
ment of the problem. As a consequence one can not gain
much information on the particle acceleration mechanisms
at work in these environments from modeling broadband
SEDs this way.

In the present work we attempt to improve on this situ-
ation by studying the impact of various injection scenarios
of relativistic particles on the resulting emitting particle
and photon spectrum. Speciﬁcally, we calculate the ambi-
ent particle spectrum that results from injection during a
ﬁnite time range in the past, and viewed at a given (snap-
shot) time. Comparing to the broken power-law, emitting-
particle spectra, which are required in broadband modeling
of blazar snapshot SEDs, will then help us draw inferences
on the required particle acceleration mechanisms.

In this sense, our approach diﬀers from works which
directly implement a speciﬁc acceleration mechanism into
an emission code (e.g., Diltz & B¨ottcher 2014).

We restrict ourselves to leptonic emission processes in
blazar jets here where external photon ﬁelds, such as ac-
cretion disk radiation and radiation partly re-scattered at
the BLR, present the dominant target for particle-photon
interactions. This setup is expected to be suitable for ap-
plication to those radio-loud jetted AGN, which show a
strong accretion disk radiation ﬁeld, such as FSRQs and
LBLs. The analog procedure, including hadronic interac-

2

tions as well, is more complex and will be postponed to a
subsequent paper.

We aim to explain the observed breaking spectra
at GeV-energies, and hence focus here on steep spec-
trum LAT-AGN. This is unlike Pacciani et al. (2014),
whose study on spectral shapes is based on a data set
in which those periods are exclusively considered where
the sources emitted signiﬁcant > 10 GeV photons and
are therefore associated with hard γ-ray spectrum-ﬂaring
events. Diltz & B¨ottcher (2014) complemented their time-
dependent leptonic blazar emission code with an implemen-
tation of a Fermi-II acceleration scenario, in addition to
time-dependent particle “pick-up”, with the goal of iden-
tifying observational signatures for the origin of ﬂares.
Hence they studied the eﬀect of a perturbation of vari-
ous input parameters that could potentially be associated
with causing outbursts on top of a steady-state situation.
They explored observational signatures such as correlations
between lightcurves at diﬀerent frequencies, possible time
lags, etc. Our present work attempts to explore the impact
of a speciﬁc injection history on the resulting high-energy
spectrum thereby oﬀering an alternative explanation for
the often observed strong breaks in bright FSRQ spectra
at GeV-energies.

Section 2 of

the

this paper describes

emission
model used here (an external inverse Compton emission
model that broadly follows Dermer & Schlickeiser 1993,
Dermer et al. 2009), and the calculation of the emitting
electron spectrum, which is the result of radiative losses
that impact upon an electron population that has been
continuously injected while propagating along the jet. Such
continuously injected electron spectra, like the one we use
in this work, were ﬁrst proposed by M¨ucke & Pohl (2000).
We present a detailed parameter study in Sect. 3, and sum-
marize and discuss the results of our work in Sect. 4.

2. Model

2.1. Basic model

We consider the AGN to be powered by accretion onto a su-
permassive Schwarzschild black hole of mass MBH. The cen-
tral black hole is surrounded by a Shakura-Sunyaev accre-
tion disk (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973). Accretion disk pho-
tons, with energy ε∗, enter the jet under the angle θ∗
accr.
These photons are scattered into the angle θ∗
s with scat-
tered photon energy ε∗
s, by the jet electrons. The plasma
outﬂow of the jet starts at a distance z0 from the cen-
tral black hole and ﬂows along the symmetry axis of the
system with bulk Lorentz factor Γ and the velocity βΓc,

where βΓ = p1 − 1/Γ2. Figure 1 illustrates the basic

model used in this work. Other than in the model of
Dermer & Schlickeiser (1993), electrons are injected con-
tinuously along the jet axis between heights za and zb with
a time-dependent injection rate ∝ z(t)−α, with α being a
free parameter. We consider cooling of the the injected elec-
trons as being dominantly the result of inverse Compton
losses on external target radiation ﬁelds. Two target pho-
ton ﬁelds are considered here: the aforementioned accretion
disk radiation, which generally enters the jet under small
angles θ∗
accr, and the accretion disk radiation that has been
backscattered by the BLR. Most of this backscattered ra-
diation enters the jet under angles θ∗ > 90◦, which leads
to a diﬀerent scattering behavior. Because the two target

head-on case:

= σT δ[εs − γ2ε(1 − β cos(ψ))]δ(Ωs − Ωe)

(2)

where σT denotes the Thomson cross-section. This is
valid as long as ε′ ≡ γε(1 − cos(ψ)) ≤ 1. For ε′ > 1 (Klein-
Nishina regime) we assume that the cross-section is zero
when calculating the cooling rates, since the Klein-Nishina
cross-section declines rapidly at high energies.

With these approximations, the integrations over Ωe
and ε are trivial. To achieve further simpliﬁcation, we av-
erage the azimuthally symmetric problem over φ implying
hcos(ψ)i = µµs .

The integrations then lead to

photon ﬁelds have diﬀerent angular distributions in the jet
frame, the inverse Compton scattered photon distributions
that are produced by each of the target photon ﬁelds shows
correspondingly diﬀerent spectral shapes. The BLR model
used here largely follows Dermer et al. (2009) and is de-
scribed in Sect. 2.2.1.

In the following, quantities with asterisks are in the rest
frame of the accretion disk. All energies are in units of the
electron rest mass mec2.

2.2. Compton cooling rates

We consider Compton cooling of electrons in the comoving
frame of the jet. This radiative cooling rate is dependent
on the diﬀerential Compton photon production rate,

δ() denotes the Delta distribution. By only considering
relativistic electrons, the assumption γ ≫ 1 is justiﬁed.

To make progress in calculating the scattered diﬀer-
ential photon production rate the two diﬀerential target
photon densities nph (in the comoving frame) are required.
Their calculations are shown in the following two sections.

2.2.1. BLR target photon density

of gas between Ri and Ro and a density gradient ζ with ne(R) ∝
Rζ (Figure adapted from Dermer et al. 2009).

Figure 2 sketches the BLR model used here, mainly fol-
lowing Dermer et al. (2009), where the BLR target photon

ﬁeld is the result of reprocessing the accretion disk radi-
ation and with any direct BLR line emissivity being ne-
glected. For the purpose of calculating the target photon
ﬁeld re-scattered at the BLR (BLR target photon ﬁeld),
we consider the central source as an isotropically emitting
point source.

An anisotropic central source would slightly increase the
energy density caused by the BLR in the jet-frame with
distance from the illuminating disk (Ghisellini & Madau
1996).

The central source radiation is isotropically Thomson-
scattered by material of the BLR, back to a distance z
(above the black hole) on the jet axis. We consider a spheri-
cally symmetric shell of thin gas for the scattering BLR ma-
terial with a density gradient inside this shell (see Fig. 2).
Taking into account a clumpy BLR, instead, would require
the introduction of further free parameters (cloud radius
distribution) while the expected impact on the distribution
of the reprocessed radiation likely stays small for not too
large cloud sizes: one would expect additional inhomogen-
ities to some extent on top of an R-dependence from the
BLR density gradient.

The calculations here are all carried out in the rest

frame of the BLR.

The Thomson-scattered photon density is obtained by

We use the law of sines R2(1 − µ2) = x2(1 − µ2

calculate the angle µ∗ under which the scattered photons
reach the point z:

¯µ∗(µ, g) deﬁnes a line. If the scattering process takes
place on that line, a photon emitted into the angle µ arrives
with angle µ∗ at point z. Formally, there are two solutions
with the positive one being the physically relevant one for
the already φ-integrated quantity ¯µ∗(µ, g).

Carrying out the integration we ﬁnd:

Here ¯g describes the radius R at which the photons,
emitted into the angle µ, have to be scattered to end up in
µ∗. ne(¯gz) is the electron density at the scattering point.
This means Π(µ∗, z) gives a measure for the total number
of photons that end up in the angle element µ∗ at point z
along the jet axis.

Π cannot be solved analytically, but numerically. The
results of these calculations, which we ﬁnd in agreement
with Dermer et al. (2009), are shown in Fig. 3. The ﬁg-
ure shows the angular distribution of the BLR photons for
diﬀerent positions z. For z ≥ Ro there are no incoming
photons from the front (µ∗ < 0) since there is no scattering
BLR material in front of z.

Here L0 = Leddledd, with Ledd the Eddington luminosity of
the black hole. Tavecchio & Ghisellini (2008) have shown

Hunger & Reimer: Shaping GeV-spectra of blazars

that the BLR radiation, simulated with the photoioniza-
tion code CLOUDY, as the target ﬁeld for inverse Compton
scattering can be adequately approximated by a blackbody
with a peak at 1.5 times the Lyα-frequency , when con-
sidering the IC spectrum above a few keV. Afterwards, we
approximate this blackbody with a monochromatic spec-
trum.

The resulting BLR target photon density is

With the diﬀerential target photon density, we now calcu-
late the scattered photon density. We use Eq.(12) together
with Eq. (3) to calculate ˙nBLR(εs, µs, z). By integrating
over all scattering angles µs, and all scattering energies εs,
we get the energy-loss rate of a single electron of given γ:

where M8 is the black hole mass in 108 solar masses .

We use a monochromatic approximation for the black-
body radiation that is emitted locally at a speciﬁc radius
˜R of the accretion disk. The mean photon energy emitted
at a radius ˜R is then given by

Because the electron energy loss rate depends on (1 −

tribute more strongly to the electron energy loss rate than
photons with incident angles µ > 0. The small number of
reprocessed BLR photons causes the energy loss due to the
BLR to be negligible for the cases that we considered here
(see Fig.4).

2.3.2. Energy loss in the accretion disk photon ﬁeld

The procedure is analogous to the BLR case: We use Eq.(3)
to calculate the diﬀerential photon production rate for one

(b) Radiative electron energy loss rates for varying γ at z = 100
and BLR1 with τBLR = 0.01. BLR shows the BLR energy loss
used in our calculations, here we set the energy loss in the Klein-
Nishina regime to 0.

Fig. 4: Comparison of radiative electron energy-loss rates. Here we choose BLR1 at z = 100 as an example, while noting that
the qualitative picture, with the negligible BLR losses, is the same in all the cases we considered in our study. We compare with
synchrotron loss rates for a B = 4.5G magnetic ﬁeld.

2.3.3. Thomson scattering criterion

The energy loss rates are calculated in the Thomson regime,
and are therefore only valid for ε′ ≡ γε(1 − cos(ψ)) ≤ 1
while, in the Klein-Nishina regime, the cross section is set
to zero. After transforming the target photon energy ε into
the rest frame of the BLR, we obtain the Thomson limit
criterion:

γΓε∗(1 − βΓµ∗)(1 − β cos(ψ)) < 1.

(24)

Again, we use the monochromatic approximation for
both external target photon ﬁelds to conﬁne the range of
γ, where both energy loss rates are in the Thomson regime.
Since 1 − β cos(ψ) can never be larger than 2, the scatter-
ing will always be in the Thomson regime if the following
relation is fulﬁlled:

2γΓε∗(1 − βΓµ∗) < 1.

(25)

The accretion disk photons will mainly enter the jet from
behind, i.e. µ∗ ≈ 1. In this case, the Thomson criterion for
scattering the accretion disk target photons is:

γ <

1

2Γε∗(1 − βΓ)

.

(26)

The BLR photons that are most important for the prob-
lem will enter the jet from the front, µ∗ ≈ −1. In this case
the Thomson criterion changes to:

γ <

1

4Γε∗

.

(27)

For larger γ, the rate of inverse Compton scattering in
the BLR reduces to the Klein-Nishina regime, which we ne-
glect in the following. We can neglect the energy loss in the
Klein-Nishina regime for the BLR target photons. This ne-
glect is justiﬁed since the energy loss owing to the BLR is
negligible with respect to the energy loss caused by the ac-
cretion disk target photons in the cases that are considered

6

in this work (see Fig.4). In the cases we studied, the ac-
cretion disk photons are usually scattered in the Thomson
regime.

2.3.4. Omission criterium for synchrotron energy losses

In particular, this work targets accretion radiation-strong
blazars such as FSRQs. Here synchrotron energy losses of
the charged particles are typically weak when compared
to Compton losses (see also Fig.4). In the Thomson limit,
synchrotron losses can therefore be neglected when, in the
B = B2
jet-frame, the magnetic ﬁeld energy density u′
8π is
much lower than the sum of all target photon ﬁelds, i.e.,:

u′
B ≪ u′

The jet-frame accretion disk energy density in the near ﬁeld
regime for a Schwarzschild black hole reads

where the galaxy-frame BLR energy density uBLR can be

2.4. The emitting electron spectrum

The equation of motion of the relativistically outﬂowing jet
with constant velocity βΓc is

z(t∗) = zi + βΓct∗.

(29)

The time interval in the rest frame of the disk is related
to the comoving frame by δt∗ = Γδt. By combining Eq. (29)
with Eq. (21) and using the solution of Eq. (23) in the near-
ﬁeld regime we get

An electron that was injected with an initial energy
γi cooled down to ˜γ after having propagated a distance
ztravel = z − zi. Accordingly, ˜γ1 corresponds to the energy
that an electron injected at point zi with the energy γ1
possesses after having propagated from zi to z. The two
Heaviside functions H[γ − ˜γ1(z)] and H[˜γ2(z) − γ] prevent
all electrons that are injected outside of the contributing
energy range from adding to Ne(γ, z).

Having determined the emitting electron spectrum, we now
proceed to calculate the scattered photon spectrum of both
the accretion disk target photon ﬁeld and the BLR tar-
get photon ﬁeld. For this purpose, we follow Dermer et al.
(2009). The νFν spectrum is given by

which describes the change of electron energy over
a distance dz. We note that, while in the model of
Dermer & Schlickeiser (1993) only Compton energy losses
in the disk radiation ﬁeld are discussed, here we also take
energy losses from Compton scattering in the BLR radia-
tion ﬁeld into account. The initial value problem for calcu-
lating the electron spectrum consists of Eq. (30), the point
z, the injection point zi, and the Lorentz factor γ that the
electrons possess, after having propagated from zi to z. This
can only be solved numerically. For all γ > 1
, the BLR
4Γε∗
component does not play a role. In this case Eq. (30) sim-
pliﬁes to

(32)

We consider the continuous injection of an electron
power-law spectrum, with spectral index s, into a moving
plasma blob along the jet at an injection rate that depends
on the height above the disk and with an injection index
α. The electron spectrum injected at height zi can be de-
scribed by Ne(γi) = Q0γ−s
i H[γi−γ1]H[γ2−γi], with Q0 the
normalization parameter. Using Eq. 32, the cooled injected
electron spectrum then has the form

Ne(γ, z, zi) = Q0 · γ−2(cid:2)γ−1 − 0.5Kn(z−2

(see also Dermer & Schlickeiser 1993).

i − z−2)(cid:3)s−2

(33)

When continuously injecting power-law electron spectra
into the moving plasma blob with a given injection rate
∝ z−α
, the resulting emitting electron spectrum Ne(γ, z)
is a superposition of the cooling electron spectra that have
been injected and weighted by the corresponding injection
rate. This is described by

After transforming the emitting electron spectrum (cal-

accretion disk by

work, the radiative output from this process has been found
to typically dominate in a rather small energy range at X-
rays (see e.g., B¨ottcher 2000, Dermer et al. 2009). Hence its
contribution to the overall shape of the SED is markedly
limited. We therefore do not include this process in our
model, noting that our studies and the predictions given
in the following should be considered with care at X-ray
energies.

The ﬁnal photon spectrum that is due to the BLR target

To calculate the target photon density nph(ε∗, µ∗) that
is produced by the accretion disk photons, we integrate
over the whole disk ﬁrst. We substitute ˙Nph in Eq. (13)

Scaling the length scales z = Rg ˜z and R = Rg ˜R in

This can be used in conjunction with Eq. (43) to ﬁnd
the scattered photon spectrum that is produced by the ac-
cretion disk target photon ﬁeld. The total photon spectrum
produced is the sum of the photon spectra from both target
photon ﬁelds.

We note that a further leptonic high-energy radiation
process which contributes to the broadband blazar SED
is synchrotron-self Compton (SSC) scattering. In the case
of quasars with strong accretion disks, as considered in this

We present the electron and photon spectra following the
calculations outlined in Sect. 2.2 and Sect. 2.5. For our
calculations we set the black hole mass to 108M⊙ (noting
that the spectral shape only depends weakly on the black
hole mass), the bulk Lorentz factor to Γ = 25, a fraction
of ledd = 0.1 of the Eddington luminosity for the central
source and use a value of ǫ∗0 = 25(mec2)−1eV as the char-
acteristic photon energy of the BLR (monochromatic) spec-
trum. Here, synchrotron energy losses can be neglected for
ﬁeld values smaller than ∼ 4.5(

)−3/2G.

2000Rg

In the following, we focus on photon spectra up to
∼ 10GeV. Hence, γ-ray absorption during propagation
through the diﬀuse extragalactic background light can
be neglected here (e.g., Abdo et al. 2010c). We also ne-
glect internal γ-ray absorption in the external radia-
tion ﬁelds, which could potentially aﬀect the spectral
shape beyond ∼ 50GeV for typical bright Fermi-LAT
FSRQs (see Sect. 4), and focus our spectral considera-
tions below this energy. We also note that most Fermi-
LAT FSRQs were not detected beyond such energies
owing to their typically strong spectral decline at a
few GeV (e.g., Ackermann et al. 2011), although few no-
table exceptions (e.g., 3C 279 (MAGIC Collaboration et al.
2008), 4C +21.35 (Aleksi´c et al. 2011), PKS 1510-089
(H.E.S.S. Collaboration et al. 2013)) exist.

Below, the photon spectra are shown in the observer
frame using a source redshift of zr = 1. All distances are
given in terms of the gravitational radius Rg.

In our parameter study, we discuss the impact of vary-
ing selected parameters, with respect to a reference model,
on the resulting particle and photon spectra. The varied
parameters are:

– The height z above the disk where the emission region

is located at observing time tobs;

– The injection-rate index α at the position z;
– The starting and end points za < z and zb > za of
the particle injection; we set z = zb unless speciﬁed
otherwise;

– The spectral index s and the high (low) energy cutoﬀ,

Table 1: List of BLR geometries used. Ri, Ro denote the inner
and outer boundary of the BLR, ζ describes the gas-density
decline in the BLR. All distances are in gravitational units.

We ﬁrst study the inﬂuence of diﬀerent BLR geometries
(as listed in Table 1) upon the inverse Compton (IC) pho-
ton spectrum. Geometries BLR1 and BLR2 follow a ζ = −2
density distribution of the BLR gas. Here most of its den-
sity is located close to the inner BLR boundary. BLR3 and
BLR4 follow a constant density distribution between the
inner and the outer radius of the BLR. The BLR geome-
try has no signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the shape of the electron
spectrum, a consequence of the electron energy-loss rates
in the BLR being rather low in general (see Sect. 2.2.1).

Figure 5a shows the total IC photon spectrum being
composed of two components: The lower energy one is pro-
duced by IC scattering the accretion disk target photons,
the second component, with a peak at around 3 GeVs, is
produced by scattering the BLR target photons. Using dif-
ferent BLR conﬁgurations with respect to the emission re-
gion leads to quite diﬀerent IC spectra, as we present in
Fig. 5b.

The BLR3 gas is distributed in a rather thin shell. With
the emitting region located at z = 2000 at the time of ob-
servation, i.e., beyond the outer boundary of the BLR3, the
BLR photons enter the blob from behind with a collision
angle similar to the accretion disk photons. The BLR3 con-
tribution is drowned out by the much more numerous accre-
tion disk photons. Hence, Fig. 5b shows that the total IC
spectrum for the BLR3 case is nearly indistinguishable from
the dominating accretion disk IC component (Fig. 5a).

In the BLR1 conﬁguration the emission region is located
within the BLR with parts of the BLR1 gas being in front of
this region. Target photons from this front part experience
a higher energy transfer than the photons from the accre-
tion disk, therefore they are scattered to higher energies.
Hence at high energies, the BLR IC component starts to
poke through the accretion disk IC component (Fig. 5b).
This behaviour becomes most prominent in the BLR2 con-
ﬁguration, where an even larger fraction of the BLR gas
lies in front of the blob. Here again, the high energy BLR
peak is produced by target photons that are backscattered
by the BLR gas in front of the emission region.

The resulting IC spectrum from the BLR4 conﬁgura-
tion, also shown in Fig. 5b, displays a shifted BLR peak
position with respect to BLR1 and BLR2. In the BLR4
conﬁguration, the emission region is located on the outer
edge of the BLR. No target photons enter the blob from
the front, but a large number of target photons enter from

the sides. The maximum energy transfer for these photons
is smaller than for photons that enter the blob from the
front, thereby shifting the peak position of the IC compo-
nent to smaller energies.

In summary, if the ambient electron spectrum is unam-
biguously determined, the relative position of the emission
region with respect to the BLR geometry inﬂuences the rel-
ative strength of BLR and accretion disk component, and
may shift the peak energy of the BLR IC component.

3.2. The luminosity of the accretion disk

The accretion disk luminosity, here measured in terms of
a fraction ledd of the Eddington luminosity, directly inﬂu-
ences the density of the target radiation ﬁeld along the jet.
Higher accretion disk luminosities lead to increased parti-
cle cooling; the ambient electron spectrum reaches to lower
minimum electron energies (see Fig. 6a). Consequently, the
corresponding IC scattered photon spectra also reach lower
energies as shown in Fig. 6b, as do the corresponding syn-
chrotron radiation spectra.

3.3. The injected particle spectrum

The injected electron spectrum, a simple power law with
spectral index s, is bracketed by the low-energy and high-
energy cutoﬀ particle Lorentz factors γ1 and γ2. The eﬀects
of varying γ1, γ2 and s with respect to the reference model
are explored below.

In Fig. 7a we show the resulting electron spectra when
γ1 is varied, while leaving all the other parameters un-
changed. Clearly, at γ = γ1 a break in the emitting elec-
tron spectrum generally occurs unless the injection rate is
very steep (see Sect. 3.4). The amount of the spectral index
change at the break energy can be understood as follows:
For energies larger than γ1, electrons are continuously in-
jected and cooled at the same time. Hence, the produced
power-law spectrum in this regime depends on the injected
electron spectral index s. At electron energies smaller than
γ1, only cooled particles accumulate. Thus the spectral
shape depends on the injection rate index α (see Sect.3.4).
The combination of s and α thus inﬂuences the broadness
of the break in the emitting particle spectrum. In particu-
lar, breaks that are larger than typical cooling breaks, as
implied, e.g., from observed GeV spectra of bright LAT
FSRQs, become possible here.

The corresponding photon spectra are shown in
Fig. 7b. The peak of the emitting electron spectrum trans-
lates into peaks in the corresponding components of the
photon spectra. The diﬀerent incident angles of the BLR
target photon component, as compared to the accretion
disk component, lead to a larger range of electron energies
that can scatter photons up to the same energy. The geo-
metric area from which the target photons can contribute to
a certain scattered photon energy slowly decreases, leading
to a more gradual decrease, rather than a sharp cut-oﬀ to-
wards high energies. The BLR peak is shifted to higher en-
ergies with respect to the accretion disk peak, again the rea-
son is the diﬀerent incident angle distribution of the BLR
target photons. In the BLR component, head-on scatter-
ing with a higher energy transfer to the photon is common.
Thus electrons with the same energy lead to higher ener-
getic scattered photons for the BLR target photons than

produced by both target photon ﬁelds separately.

for the accretion disk photons. In Fig. 7b, we also note
the decreasing contribution of the Compton scattered BLR
radiation to the total photon spectrum with increasing γ1,
a consequence of scattering in the Klein-Nishina regime of
the cross-section with increasing energy.

As mentioned above, a change of the spectral injection
index s impacts the energy range above γ1 in the emitting
particle spectrum, becoming softer for softer injection spec-
tra, and behaving as ne(γ) ∝ γ−s−1. Hence for a given in-
jection rate index α, the spectral break in the emitting par-
ticle spectrum becomes broader for harder injection spectra
(see Fig. 8a). For suﬃcient broad ambient electron spec-
tra, the corresponding photon spectra from IC scattering
the accretion disk and BLR radiation tend to merge into
one component as is shown in Fig. 8b. Again, we also note
the impact of the IC scattering in the Klein-Nishina regime,
which leads, for the same ambient electron spectrum, to
softer photon spectra of the BLR-scattered component, as

compared to the accretion disk scattered IC component be-
yond the respective peak energy.

Very high energy electrons cool eﬃciently in the dense
target radiation ﬁelds. Hence the particle spectrum above
γ1 quickly re-arranges to a state where injection rates bal-
ance the loss rates. For a suﬃciently large high-energy cut-
oﬀ of the injected electron spectrum, γ2, where the radia-
tive loss timescales at γ2 are much smaller than the in-
jection timescale, any variation of this parameter therefore
only marginally impacts on the resulting emitting electron
and photon spectrum: The ambient particle spectra be-
come very similar after only a short time owing to severe
Compton losses.

For cases where the injected electron spectrum is
bounded to an energy range where injection rates reach
at least the radiative loss rates, a variation of γ2 results in
a corresponding cut-oﬀ of the ambient particle and photon
spectra, as shown in Fig. 9. The values used in Fig. 9 for γ2

components are visibly seperated only for suﬃciently low
γ2.

3.4. The particle injection mode

The eﬀects of diﬀerent particle injection scenarios on the
resulting emitting electron and photon spectra are explored
in this section. Particle injection starts within the jet at
height za above the accretion disk and continues with a
rate ∝ z−α
(where α is the injection rate index) up to a
i
height zb.

The injection rate index α controls the spectral shape
of the ambient particle spectrum below γ1 and (together

n (γ−1 − γ−1

i − z−2 < 2K −1

with s) the spectral index change of the break. Fig. 10
shows that harder pre-break spectral shapes develop for
steeper injection rate distributions (large α). This can be
understood as follows: Particles in the pre-break regime
γ < γ1 are cooled electrons, which have suﬀered energy
losses while propagating at least a distance that corre-
sponds to z−2
1 ), where zi was
the injection point. This implies a direct relation between γ
and zi. Hence those particles injected at point zi contribute
to the ambient spectrum at γ < γ1. Since cooling rates are
highest where the injection starts (at za), the number of
particles injected there contribute to the lowest energies
γ ≪ γ1 in the ambient spectrum. As a consequence, for
very steep injection rate distributions, rather soft ambient
spectra develop while, for shallow injection distributions,
hard emitting particle spectra build up at γ < γ1 (see Fig.
10). Speciﬁcally, for constant injection rates (α = 0), we

Fig. 10: Photon and ambient electron spectra with diﬀerent injection rate parameters α, with respect to the reference model. The
total injected electron energies for α = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) are calculated to Υinj = (4 · 105, 512, 1, 0.3, 9 · 10−6). In the case of α = 4, we
also show the IC components produced by both target photon ﬁelds separately.

ﬁnd an approximately ∝ γ−1/2 behaviour at γ < γ1. For
α = 3, injection rates decrease with distance z at the same
rate as the cooling decreases. The ambient electron spec-
trum becomes independent of the blob location, and the
well-known ne ∝ γ−2 emitting electron spectrum develops
for γ < γ1. For well-developed electron distributions, α does
not impact the spectral shape at γ > γ1.

Particle injection starts within the jet at height za above
the accretion disk. Figure 11 shows the resulting electron
and photon spectra for diﬀerent values of za, all other in-
jection parameters are kept constant.

A higher cooling rate in the accretion disk radiation
ﬁeld, as well as a longer total cooling time (due to larger
z − za distance), leads to lower electron energies with de-
creasing za (see Fig. 11a). Hence, the corresponding pho-
ton spectrum below γ1 (Fig. 11b) softens and extends to
very low energies depending on za.

Next, we explore the situation of a ﬁnite particle injec-
tion duration (corresponding to a distance zb − za in the
jet) where the resulting spectra are observed at a given time
after the last particle injection has occured. This time cor-
responds to a distance z−zb in the jet. Figure 12 shows the
resulting electron and photon spectrum for various z with
ﬁxed points za and zb. Because of the strong energy depen-
dence of the electron cooling (with higher energy electrons
cooling faster than lower energy electrons; see Sect.3.3) we
observe the exponential high energy cut-oﬀ in the electron
spectrum moving to lower energies while, below γ1, the elec-
tron spectrum does not change signiﬁcantly.

The inﬂuence of the electron cut-oﬀ is reﬂected in the
corresponding photon spectrum. Although the electron in-
jection spectral index s is constant, the post-break photon
spectrum becomes softer, owing to the lower energies of
the electron energy cut-oﬀ. In Fig. 12b, we also show the

total photon spectrum decomposed into the IC-scattered
accretion disk and BLR photon spectrum. We note that
the turn-over in the photon spectrum at a few GeV has its
origin in the break of the underlying electron spectrum.

We now explore the impact of a changing injection du-
ration upon the resulting spectra. For this purpose, we vary
zb while keeping za ﬁxed, and analyse the resulting particle
and photon spectra at z = zb. The longer the injection at
a given rate, the higher the total injected particle energy.
At the same time, the particles cool, at a, generally, de-
creasing rate with increasing distance from the black hole.
Hence, we ﬁnd a strong dependence of the resulting spec-
tral shapes upon the interplay between the injection and
energy-loss rates. Therefore, we also present our results for
various injection rate indices α.

For a suﬃciently shallow decrease of the injection rate,
a pile-up forms in the emitting particle spectrum at γ = γ1,

with the spectral index below γ1 becoming harder. This is a
result of the cooling rate of particles at low energies not be-
ing suﬃciently large to be able to fully balance the injection
rate at these energies. Long injection times at suﬃciently
large z ensure an accumulation of particles at low energies,
with reduced cooling rates leading to the pile-ups becoming
more prominent with increasing zb. This is demonstrated in
Figs. 13a and 13b, where the spectra are shown for α = 2
and various zb.

Electrons pile up at a given particle energy γ in a spec-
trum when, in momentum space, the net change of the num-
ber of electrons entering this γ-bin (either from injection
or from cooling down from a higher energy bin γ + dγ)
and leaving this bin to γ − dγ, due to cooling, is posi-
tive. For an increasing cooling rate with energy, this oc-
curs at the low-energy end of the injected spectrum, i.e.,
at γ = γ1. For broad injection distributions α < 3 parti-

energies for zb = (1000, 2000, 3000, 4000) are Υinj = (0.9, 1, 1.04, 1.06). For zb = 1000, the IC photon components produced by the

cle injection at large z, where cooling rates are diminished,
is still signiﬁcant. This facilitates accumulating particles
within an energy bin. A pile-up forms. As noted above,
for α = 3, the emitting electron spectrum becomes inde-
pendent of the blob location, and hence also of zb. Thus,
in this case, a pile-up does not form (see Fig. 14a). For
α > 3, the eﬀects discussed above reverse and the spectral
index becomes softer after the break γ = γ1. In Fig. 14c
we present the case of α = 7. Here the injection scenario be-
comes more “instantaneous-like”, and we follow the evolu-
tion of the injected spectrum for a time that corresponds to
(zb − za)/βΓc. For increasing zb, the emitting electron spec-
trum steepens while extending to low energies γ < γ1 owing
to cooling. In the limit of large zb, all electrons have cooled
and the injected power law is mapped into the γ < γ1 en-
ergy regime. The overall peak of the emitting electron spec-
trum for an instantaneous-like injection is therefore found
at the low-energy end. Here, the emitting electrons corre-
spond to the cooled particles that were injected at γ1. Their
energy depends on the cooling rate, which is highest at the
injection point za.

The corresponding photon spectra (see Figs. 13b, 14b
and 14d) reﬂect the shapes of the respective ambient elec-
tron spectra, with some impact of the relative position of
the emitting region with respect to the BLR (the latter has
been discussed in more detail in Sect. 3.1). We note the
shift of the IC peaks in Fig. 14d to lower energies which is
due to the corresponding emitting electron spectra peaking
in these cases at the very low-energy end.

4. Modeling the 3C 454.3 and PKS 1510-089

multifrequency SEDs

To show the viability of our model, we apply it to quasi-
simultaneous broadband data that was collected during the
November 2010 outburst of 3C 454.3 (Abdo et al. 2011,
Wehrle et al. 2012), with a particular focus on the Fermi-
LAT spectrum that shows a distinct spectral decline at
a few GeV. Additionally, we use our model to also ﬁt
the quasi-simultaneous broadband SED of PKS 1510-089,

as reported in Abdo et al. 2010b. The low-energy photon
data provides additional valuable constraints on the emit-
ting electron distributions. Within our model, we calculate
the synchrotron radiation from the ambient electron distri-
bution following Dermer et al. (2009), assuming a tangled
magnetic ﬁeld of strength B, and including synchrotron-self
absorption.

4.1. Modeling the 3C 454.3 multifrequency SED

In the following, we discuss two possible model ﬁts to the
data. The parameter values used for these ﬁts are listed
in Table 2, including the required particle power Ppar of
the complete injection event, which was calculated by as-
suming that the total power in particles (electrons and cold
protons) is tenfold the power in nonthermal electrons, the
magnetic ﬁeld power PB, and the equipartition ﬁeld Beq.

In Fig. 15 we present a model representation of the
broadband data with parameter values similar to those used
in Finke & Dermer (2010). The size of the BLR used in our
model agrees well with Bonnoli et al. 2011, but is diﬀerent
from the one used in Finke & Dermer (2010). Other slight
diﬀerences in the ﬁt parameter values are due to the dif-
ferent data set we used. We note that the (observer frame)
sizes of the emitting region, which are used in the model
ﬁts we present, are roughly around the size limits inferred
by Sbarrato et al. (2011). Here, we searched for particle in-
jection parameter values that lead, in the framework of our
model, to an ambient snapshot electron spectrum similar
to the ad hoc ambient electron spectrum used in the afore-
mentioned paper. We ﬁnd that continuous electron injec-
tion is indeed able to generate a broken power-law emitting
electron spectrum that is similar to the one assumed in
Finke & Dermer (2010). For this model ﬁt, the γ-ray pho-
ton spectrum is explained by the combination of a BLR and
an accretion disk target photon component in the same way
as in Finke & Dermer (2010). We found reasonable ﬁts for
a range of particle injection parameter values. The injec-
tion spectral index s of the electron spectrum is required
to lie within the range of 2 and 3. The model ﬁt is some-

energies for zb = (1000, 2000, 3000, 4000) are Υinj = (5.8, 5.8, 5.8, 5.8) · 10−13. For α = 3 and α = 7 with zb = 1000, we also show
the IC photon components produced by the two target photon ﬁelds separately.

what insensitive to changes in α, the injection rate index,
providing α ≤ 4. For α > 4, the ambient electron spectrum
would become too soft to be able to ﬁt the low energy part
(< 1 eV) of the optically thin synchrotron radiation compo-
nent. The parameter γ1 controls the position of the break
in the emitting electron spectrum. Hence the model ﬁt is
quite sensitive to changes in this parameter. We found rea-
sonable ﬁts with γ1 between 800 and 1300. Furthermore,
sensible ﬁts were found when z = zb was between 1500 and
3000. For γ2 > 20000 the post-break (> 3 GeV) spectral in-
dex does not adequately represent the data. For γ2 < 10000
the GeV-spectrum becomes two-peak shaped, which does
not ﬁt the data well. The ﬁrst injection point za is not well
constrained here by the data since it merely inﬂuences the
pre-break photon spectrum. Reasonable ﬁts can be achieved
for values between za = 100 and 800.

In the previous section, we demonstrated that broken
power-law ambient electron spectra with changes in the
spectral index, whihc are greater than the cooling break,

can develop as a result of the continuously varying injec-
tion of non-thermal particles along the jet. We apply this
property to the broadband data of 3C 454.3 to demonstrate
that the observed decline of the GeV-spectrum in bright
FSRQs can be consistently modeled by this kind of sce-
nario. Unlike in the previous ﬁt, where two IC components
are required, this scenario requires only one, but dominat-
ing IC component. In Fig. 16, we show a model ﬁt to the
data with a higher optical thickness (τBLR = 0.05) of the
BLR. As a consequence, the BLR IC component dominates
at γ-ray energies > 10 MeV. The GeV spectral turn-over
here is due to a corresponding break in the emitting elec-
tron spectrum, i.e., not the result of a combination of the
accretion disk and BLR IC component. This diﬀerent be-
havior also leads to diﬀerences with respect to the sensi-
tivity of the model parameter values. The parameter value
of za here is more constrained, since the pre-break emis-
sion of the BLR IC component dominates in the sub-GeV
energy range (around 100 MeV). We require za < 200 to

adequately ﬁt the data. Similarly, changes in the last injec-
tion point zb also impact the shape of the resulting ambient
spectrum in the pre- as well as post-break regime. Choosing
zb between 2000 and 3000 leads to reasonable model ﬁts.
The injection rate index α inﬂuences the pre-break spec-
trum, and is therefore rather tightly constrained, as well,
to values between α = 4 and 4.5, with electron injection
spectral indices lying in the range s = 1.5 − 2.5. This choice
also leads to a satisfying model representation of the ob-
served synchrotron spectrum. The parameter values for γ1
and γ2 are similarly constrained, as in the previous model
ﬁt.

In summary, both model ﬁts to the ﬂare 3C 454.3 data
set point towards gradually decreasing injection rates that
start close to the inner boundary of the BLR but do not
extend beyond the outer boundary of the BLR at the time
of observations. Nalewajko et al. (2014) explored the eﬃ-
ciency of several constraints for the location of the blazar
zone, such as the collimation, SSC, cooling and internal
γ-ray opacity constraints. Although, in our modeling, we

adopted a somewhat weaker accretion disk and BLR lumi-
nosity than Nalewajko et al. (2014) for the November 2010
ﬂare of 3C 454.3, we ﬁnd that the blazar zone location in
our model ﬁts is in agreement with Nalewajko et al. (2014).
The injection spectrum is found to be surprisingly nar-
row, between γ ∼ 103 − 104. The Thomson optical thick-
ness τBLR of the diﬀuse BLR gas inﬂuences the relative
importance of the BLR and accretion disk IC components.
Accordingly, for a very low τBLR, the spectral decline ob-
served at a few GeV from 3C 454.3 can be explained by
the combination of both IC components while, for suﬃ-
ciently larger τBLR, the GeV-break in the photon spectrum
is due to an intrinsic break in the emitting electron spec-
trum where the injection properties play a decisive role.
The break energy is determined by the low-energy cut-oﬀ
γ1 of the injected electron spectrum. The observed, approx-
imately constant, break energies that are independent of
ﬂux state (e.g., Abdo et al. 2011) imply a correspondingly
constant γ1 for a constant Doppler factor, if there is no
rapid change from a continuous to impulsive-like injection

mode (or vice versa). The energy density of the magnetic
ﬁeld for these model ﬁts is found below the jet-frame disk
energy density up to distances ∼ 2000 − 3000Rg above the
black hole, and therefore justiﬁes the neglect of synchrotron
losses up to these distances.

Potentially, γ-ray absorption, followed by pair produc-
tion in the BLR radiation ﬁeld, may impact the emerg-
ing photon spectrum (e.g., Donea & Protheroe 2003). Here,
not only absolute luminosities of the BLR are important,
but also its geometrical structure. For example, for a ﬂat
BLR geometry in blazars with typical BLR parameters,
Lei & Wang (2014) demonstrate that high energy photons
up to tens of GeV can escape this region.

We therefore investigate the importance of this pro-
cess for the above parameter values. For a smooth broad-
band target spectrum, most of the photon-photon inter-
actions take place in a small energy interval that is cen-
tered on ǫtarget ≈ 3.1ǫ∗−1
(e.g., Reimer 2007) in the galaxy
frame owing to the strongly peaked cross-section near the
threshold. Gamma-gamma absorption in the BLR radia-

s

tion ﬁeld therefore modiﬁes the observed γ-ray spectrum
beyond ǫ ≈ 3.1(ǫ0∗(1 + zr))−1, which is above the highest
photon energy detected from this source for our parameter
choice of ǫ0∗ = 10(mec2)−1eV.

During the April and September 2013 outbursts of this
source, Pacciani et al. (2014) noted a very diﬀerent ﬂaring
behavior: hard LAT-ﬂares with exceptional hard power-law
spectra, as opposed to the soft ﬂaring events from 3C 454.3
that are considered in this work, which typically show
strong declines or even cut-oﬀs in the GeV range. From
γγ-pair production arguments and the non-detection of any
KN-curvature during these hard ﬂare events, Pacciani et al.
(2014) argue that the emission region must be beyond or
at the outer rim of the BLR, where the bulk of the gamma-
rays are produced by Comptonization of photons from the
IR torus.

4.2. Modeling the PKS 1510-089 multifrequency SED

The FSRQ PKS 1510-089 at redshift ∼ 0.361 is among
the best observed γ-ray blazars with a well-constrained
SED from radio to γ rays. We apply our model to the
quasi-simultanuous broadband data from the January 2009
ﬂare, as published in Abdo et al. (2010b), the ﬁrst ﬂare
in a series of outbursts from this source in early 2009.
These observations indicate variability on timescales of a
day down to a few hours (e.g., Abdo et al. 2010a). Though
PKS 1510-089 is a known VHE FSRQ (Wagner et al.,
2010), it has not been detected at VHEs during the consid-
ered outburst. Apart from γ-ray observations, this source
has also been monitored during the 2009 activity at radio,
optical (including polarization measurements) and X-rays
(Marscher et al., 2010). The appearance of two new knots
on VLBA 43 GHz radio maps around August 2008 and
April 2009, which move with superluminal speeds of ∼ 24c
and ∼ 22c along the jet, seem to indicate a relation between
these ﬂaring events and their appearance (Marscher et al.,
2010). The optical polarization vector started rotating by
∼ 720o just after the ﬂare that we consider here. The Fermi-
LAT spectrum, during the January 2009 ﬂare, indicates a
pronounced steep decline at a few GeV, which has been ob-
servationally described by a log-parabolic shaped spectrum
(Abdo et al., 2010a).

We present two sets of parameter values (see Table 3)
that have been found to represent the data from the
January 2009 ﬂare well. Here again, the listed particle
power Ppar (including electrons and cold protons) is given
as tenfold the total injected power of the nonthermal elec-
trons. To quantify the black hole mass and accretion disk

18

luminosity, we use M8 = 5 and ledd = 0.16, which agrees
well with data presented in Pucella et al. (2008).

In Fig. 17, we show a model ﬁt where the joint
Compton-scattered disk and BLR radiation explains the
observed LAT-spectrum. In this ﬁt, we keep the BLR
geometry unchanged with respect to the 3C 454.3 ﬁts,
and use a (observer-frame) size of the emitting region of
Rb = 1 · 1015cm, in agreement with Abdo et al. (2010a)
and the inferred limits of Sbarrato et al. (2011). We now
discuss the robustness of the parameter values used for our
model ﬁt. As in the ﬁt to 3C 454.3, the model is quite sen-
sitive to changes in γ1 since it controls the position of the
breaks in the electron spectrum and, in turn, also controls
the position of the respective breaks in the photon spectra.
The injection spectral index s for this ﬁt is required to lie
between 1.5 and 2.5 for a reasonable ﬁt. The model ﬁt is
again rather insensitive to changes in the injection param-
eter α since changes in this parameter mostly inﬂuence the
spectral index before the break in the respective photon
spectra. We get the best ﬁt for z = zb = 3000Rg, but val-
ues from 2000Rg to 4000Rg also lead to reasonable ﬁts. For
γ2, we can achieve reasonable ﬁts up to a value of 2 · 104,
otherwise the model does not describe the high energy part
(> 1 GeV) of the data adequately. As in the 3C 454.3 case,
the ﬁrst injection point za is not well constrained. Values
between za = 200Rg and za = 800Rg lead to reasonable
ﬁts. We note that the parameter values for this ﬁt are quite
similar to the ones used for the 3C 454.3 data set.

In Fig. 18 we present a model that is able to explain the
γ-ray data with Compton-scattered accretion disk radiation
only. Here, the break in the GeV-spectrum is generated by
the break in the corresponding emitting electron spectrum.
By reducing the geometric thickness of the BLR and keep-
ing a realistic BLR optical depth, the importance of the
BLR as a target photon ﬁeld is diminished for the emit-
ting region, since it is located at snapshot time just beyond
the BLR border. Particle injection started when the emis-
sion region was inside the BLR and stopped just beyond
the border of the BLR. We found that the accretion disk
radiation dominated the target photon ﬁeld energy density
in this case. Other than the change of the BLR geometry,
the ﬁt parameter values are similar to the ones ﬁtting the
two-component model with only slight changes in γ1 and
the bulk Doppler factor. Our ﬁt is found to be sensitive
again to changes in γ1 since it controls the position of the
break. The injected electron spectrum is as narrow as in the
3C 454.3 ﬁt, extending from γ ∼ 103 − 104. For the other
parameters, we reached reasonable ﬁts at roughly the same
parameter ranges that we used for the two-component ﬁt.
Both model ﬁts to the PKS 1510-089 data require a con-
tinuous injection scenario with gradually decreasing injec-
tion rates. Thus, impulsive injection scenarios (i.e., α > 5)
are again disfavored. In both of our model representations
of the PKS 1510-089 data set, the accretion disk IC com-
ponent is more prominent than in the 3C 454.3 ﬁts. The
energy density of the magnetic ﬁeld for these model ﬁts
is found below the jet-frame disk energy density up to dis-
tances ∼ 2000 − 3000Rg above the black hole, and therefore
justiﬁes the neglect of synchrotron losses up to these dis-
tances.

Abdo et al. (2010a) modelled this ﬂare by also using a
stationary leptonic blazar model, however, they were using
parameter values that put more emphasis on the (assumed
non-stratiﬁed) BLR and less on the accretion disk radia-

Hunger & Reimer: Shaping GeV-spectra of blazars

tion ﬁeld than our model parameter set values (and also
the modeling of B¨ottcher et al. (2013) of this source). As
a consequence the LAT-data are explained rather by dom-
inantly Compton-scattered BLR-photons from lower ener-
getic electrons than our model envisions. The corresponding
SSC component is found to be negligible.

Interestingly, our spectral modeling of this ﬂaring
event being due to the Compton scattered accretion disk
and BLR photons from a ∼ 1G magnetized jet emis-
sion region, is in qualitative agreement with the scenario
Marscher et al. (2010) proposed for this activity period.

Nalewajko et al. (2014) place the emission region of the
April 2009 ﬂare of this source outside the BLR, while no
constraints were put on the January 2009 outburst. Our
model ﬁt parameters for this January 2009 ﬂare point to-
wards an emission region that is located inside the BLR
at the time of this ﬂare. If the series of ﬂares in 2009 of
PKS 1510-089 were causally connected, possibly originating
from the same so-called blob that was moving along the jet,
then the location of this blob that caused the January 2009
ﬂare would be well outside the BLR at the time of the April
2009 ﬂare, assuming no strong blob-braking. This would be
compatible with the results of Nalewajko et al. (2014).

We note that

the HERSCHEL PACS & SPIRE
source in late 2011
data from observations of
(Nalewajko et al. 2012) lie above our model curves. Hence,
if this IR ﬂux were comparable during the here considered
2009 event, these IR photons would have to be produced by
a further region within the jet with possibly some notable
contribution from the dusty torus.

this

Similar to 3C 454.3 (see Sect. 4.1), we ﬁnd γγ-pair
production being negligible for the parameter set used for
the above model ﬁts and below the last LAT data point
(Barnacka 2013).

Chen et al. (2012) modelled the last ﬂare in the ex-
tended early 2009 ﬂaring episode of this source by using
a time-dependent Monte Carlo Fokker-Planck code, where
the emission region is treated as an extended cylindrical vol-
ume within the jet. In addition to a particle “pick-up” term
in the Fokker-Planck equation, they also included a stochas-
tic acceleration term and took into account all external and
internal target photon ﬁelds. Although, in their modeling,
they did not discuss pronounced GeV spectral turn-over,
but rather focused on spectral variability, they note the
impact of not only internal but also external light-travel
time eﬀects causing complex spectral shapes and variations
in this March 2009 ﬂaring event. In our approach to explain
complex high-energy spectral shapes, we found that the in-
jection history already has a strong impact, and is able to
reproduce the typically observed pronounced turn-overs at
GeV energies.

5. Summary and conclusion

Within the framework of a leptonic emission model for
blazars, where inverse Compton scattering on external ra-
diation ﬁelds dominates, we considered the case of contin-
uous particle injection of a given simple power law along
the jet with various injection rates, durations, and loca-
tions of the emission region within the jet. We calculated
the emitting particle spectrum that results from this kind
of setup at a snapshot time tobs, taking into account radia-
tive cooling (in the Thomson regime) in the accretion disk
and BLR radiation ﬁeld during injection self-consistently.

This prescription oﬀers the possibility to explain a broad
range of ambient electron spectral shapes, including spec-
tral breaks that are signiﬁcantly larger than simple cooling
breaks. The injection properties may provide valuable in-
formation on the acceleration mode at work. Hence, our
simple phenomenological prescription has the potential to
ﬁnd interesting clues in this aspect by rigorously analyz-
ing the ambient electron spectrum that is required for the
broadband ﬁt of a given quasi-simultaneous multifrequency
data set, in conjunction with constraints that are inferred
from correlated variability studies and γ-ray opacity argu-
ments.

For example, the peak of the emitting electron spec-
trum can, in general, be linked to the minimum injection
energy γ1mec2 if the injection rate distribution is not too
steep. For impulsive-like injections (i.e., large α within our
model) the peak in the ambient particle spectrum is, in-
stead, associated with the smallest cooled electron energy.
The peak in the electron spectrum results in corresponding
spectral turn-overs in the Compton-scattered photon com-
ponents. Thus γ1 is a parameter that may inﬂuence the
γ-ray break energy.

Our model has the potential to describe broad high-
energy components, as well as double-peaked ones (with one
peak corresponding to Compton-scattered accretion disk
photons, and the second one from IC-scattered BLR radi-
ation ﬁeld). The former case arises for not too steep injec-
tion spectra, while very steep ones, or injections where γ2
is suitably small, can give SEDs with double-peaked γ-ray
spectra. In general the injection spectral index s, together
with γ2 and the time since last injection (given the ac-
cretion disk luminosity), mostly determine the post-break

tion rate index α. Together with analyzing the high energy
component with suﬃcient broadband coverage and a fair
knowledge of the accretion disk radiation, the remaining
particle injection properties can be constrained.

The injection rate index α strongly inﬂuences the ambi-
ent electron spectrum ahead of the peak. Observationally,
this may be visible below the photon turnover frequency in
case of one Compton-scattered component that dominates
the high-energy regime, or in the synchrotron component
in the optically thin pre-break energy range. The accre-
tion disk IC component would mask the low-energy part
of the BLR IC component in a two-component IC scenario.
Accordingly, the rate of injection might be directly reﬂected
in the pre-break shape of the GeV-spectrum in the former
case.

Limits in the initial injection point za of the ﬂare can
be derived if the smallest particle energy in the cooled elec-
tron spectrum can be estimated, given the accretion disk
luminosity.

In summary, if the ambient electron spectrum is un-
ambiguously determined (e.g., from the optically thin syn-
chrotron spectrum), it is possible to set limits on the injec-

We have demonstrated this for the SEDs of two FSRQs,
3C 454.3 and PKS 1510-089 where the ﬂare state broad-
band SEDs have been analyzed to derive information on
the required injection scenario. Two principally diﬀer-
ent scenarios per source were found to be viable: a one-
component IC model, where either the Compton-scattered
BLR or accretion disk radiation ﬁeld dominates, and a two-
component model as proposed in Finke & Dermer (2010)
for 3C 454.3. Accordingly, the origin of the observed spec-
tral turn-over at a few GeV is either found in the corre-
sponding break in the ambient electron spectrum, or is due
to the combination of Compton-scattered accretion disk
and BLR radiation ﬁeld.

A constant GeV break energy that is independent of

ﬂux level for not signiﬁcantly changing beaming parame-
ters during ﬂux variations. The required injection param-
eters for both cases of the two sources studied disfavor
impulsive-like/instantaneous electron injection, but point
towards rather narrow particle spectra injected continu-
ously with a gradually decreasing rate into the moving
plasma blob. For all of our model ﬁts, the emitting region is
either inside or just beyond the BLR, which is compatible
with the results of Nalewajko et al. (2014), thus making the
BLR an integral part of the model. In this context, we also
note that the BLR geometry impacts the resulting γ-ray
spectra. A good knowledge of the BLR structure therefore
improves accurate and unambiguous modeling of the γ-ray
spectrum. In all scenarios, a further spectral break would
be expected at a few tens of MeV. In the one-component IC
scenario for 3C 454.3, this break arises from the combina-
tion of IC-scattered accretion disk and BLR photons. The
break energy is determined by the smallest energy in the
ambient electron spectrum, which in turn is inﬂuenced by
the initial injection point za. In the two-component IC sce-
nario, this energy corresponds to the IC scattered (in the ac-
cretion disk) ambient particle break energy or the smallest

energy of this spectrum. Potentially, these scenarios could,
observationally, be distinguished by an improved coverage
of the 0.1-1 eV (12.4-1.3 µm) energy range of the optically
thin jet emission quasi-simultaneously to the γ-ray observa-
tions, and/or precision measurements at MeV energies, in
conjunction with GeV observations, which might become
possible with future projects like AstroMeV1 or the pro-
posed GAMMA-LIGHT (Morselli et al. 2013) instrument.
Extending the GeV energy range of the Fermi-LAT instru-
ment down to few tens of MeV and using the LAT Pass
8 event-level analysis (Atwood et al., 2013) may already
provide a possibility of distinguishing between models that
show notably diﬀerent spectral signatures in that energy
range, as is the case, of the presented 3C 454.3 models.
