A powerful approach to analysing quantum systems with dimensionality d > 1 involves

adding a weak coupling to an array of one-dimensional (1D) chains. The resultant quasi-one-

dimensional (q1D) systems can exhibit long-range order at low temperature, but are heavily

inﬂuenced by interactions and disorder due to their large anisotropies. Real q1D materi-

als are therefore ideal candidates not only to provoke, test and reﬁne theories of strongly

correlated matter, but also to search for unusual emergent electronic phases. Here we re-

port the unprecedented enhancement of a superconducting instability by disorder in single

crystals of Na2−δMo6Se6, a q1D superconductor comprising MoSe chains weakly coupled by

Na atoms. We argue that disorder-enhanced Coulomb pair-breaking (which usually destroys

superconductivity) may be averted due to a screened long-range Coulomb repulsion intrinsic

to disordered q1D materials. This scenario is supported by the normal-state electrical re-

sistivity of Na2−δMo6Se6, which is compatible with theories for disordered 1D systems with

attractive electron-electron interactions. However, several features in our data cannot be de-

scribed by existing models, including an emergent mobility edge and a frequency-dependent

conductivity at low temperature. Our results illustrate the capability of disorder to tune

and induce new correlated electron physics in low-dimensional materials.

Weakly-interacting electrons in a three-dimensional (3D) periodic potential are well-described

by Landau-Fermi liquid theory,1 in which the free electrons of a Fermi gas become “dressed”

quasiparticles with renormalised dynamical properties. Conversely, in the one-dimensional (1D)

limit a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) is formed,2,3 where single-particle excitations are replaced

by highly correlated collective excitations. So far, it has proved diﬃcult to interpolate theoretically
between these two regimes, either by strengthening electron-electron (e−-e−) interactions in 3D, or
by incorporating weak transverse coupling into 1D models.4,5 The invariable presence of disorder in

real materials places further demands on theory, particularly in the description of ordered electronic

ground states. Q1D systems such as nanowire ropes, ﬁlamentary networks or single crystals with

uniaxial anisotropy therefore represent an opportunity to experimentally probe what theories aspire

to model: strongly correlated electrons subject to disorder in a highly anisotropic 3D environment.

Physical properties of q1D materials may vary considerably with temperature. TLL theory

is expected to be valid at elevated temperatures, since electrons cannot hop coherently perpen-

dicular to the high-symmetry axis and q1D systems behave as decoupled arrays of 1D ﬁlaments.
Phase-coherent single-particle hopping can only occur below temperature Tx ≤ t⊥ (where t⊥ is
the transverse hopping integral), at which a dimensional crossover to an anisotropic quasi-three-

dimensional (q3D) electron liquid is anticipated.4,6 The properties of such q3D liquids remain

largely unknown, especially the role of electronic correlations in determining the ground state. At

low temperature, a TLL is unstable to either density wave (DW) or superconducting ﬂuctuations,
depending on whether the e−-e− interaction is repulsive (due to Coulomb forces) or attractive

(from electron-phonon coupling). Following dimensional crossover, the inﬂuence of such interac-

tions in the q3D state is unclear. As an example, electrical transport in the TLL state of the q1D
purple bronze Li0.9Mo6O17 is dominated by repulsive e−-e− interactions,7,8 yet a superconducting
transition occurs below 1.9 K.

Disorder adds further complication to q1D materials due to its tendency to localise electrons
at low temperature. For dimensionality d ≤ 2, localisation occurs for any non-zero disorder; in
contrast, for d > 2 a critical disorder is required and a mobility edge separates extended from

localised states. The question of whether a mobility edge can form in q1D materials after crossover

to a q3D liquid state is open, as is the microscopic nature of the localised phase. Disorder also
renormalises e−-e− interactions, leading to a dynamic ampliﬁcation of the Coulomb repulsion9 and
a weaker enhancement of phonon-mediated e−-e− attraction, i.e. Cooper pairing.10–13 We therefore

anticipate that disorder should strongly suppress superconductivity in q1D materials, unless the

Coulomb interaction is unusually weak or screened.

3

In this work, we show that the q1D superconductor Na2−δMo6Se6 provides a unique environ-

ment in which to study the interplay between dimensionality, electronic correlations and disorder.

Although Na2−δMo6Se6 is metallic at room temperature, the presence of Na vacancy disorder leads

to electron localisation and a divergent resistivity ρ(T ) at low temperature, prior to a supercon-

ducting transition. In contrast with all other known superconductors, the onset temperature for

superconducting ﬂuctuations Tpk is positively correlated with the level of disorder. Normal-state
electrical transport measurements also display signatures of an attractive e−-e− interaction, which

is consistent with disorder-enhanced superconductivity. A plausible explanation for these phenom-

ena is an intrinsic screening of the long-range Coulomb repulsion in Na2−δMo6Se6, arising from

the high polarisability of disordered q1D materials. The combination of disorder and q1D crystal

symmetry constitutes a new recipe for strongly correlated electron liquids with tunable electronic

properties.

I. RESULTS

Crystal and electronic structure of Na2−δMo6Se6

Na2−δMo6Se6 belongs to the q1D M2Mo6Se6 family14 (M = Group IA alkali metals, Tl, In)

which crystallise with hexagonal space group P63/m. The structure can be considered as a linear
condensation of Mo6Se8 clusters into inﬁnite-length (Mo6Se6)∞ chains, weakly coupled by M atoms

(Fig. 1a). The q1D nature of these materials is apparent from the needle-like morphology of as-

grown crystals (Fig. 1b; see Methods for growth details). Ab initio calculations using density

functional theory (Supplementary Information [SI] section I) reveal an electronic structure which

is uniquely simple amongst q1D metals. A single spin-degenerate band of predominant Mo dxz

character crosses the Fermi energy EF at half-ﬁlling (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Fig. S1), creating a
1D Fermi surface composed of two sheets lying close to the Brillouin zone boundaries at ±π/c.
The warping of these sheets (and hence the coupling between (Mo6Se6)∞ chains) is controlled by
the M cation, yielding values for t⊥ ranging from 230 K (M = Tl) to 30 K (M = Rb) (Fig. S2).

In addition to tuning the dimensionality, M also controls the ground state: M = Tl, In are

superconductors,15,16 while M = K, Rb become insulating at low temperature.16,17

Within the M2Mo6Se6 family, M = Na is attractive for two reasons. Firstly, we calculate an
intermediate t⊥ = 120 K, suggesting that Na2−δMo6Se6 lies at the threshold between supercon-

ducting and insulating instabilities. Secondly, the combination of the small Na cation size and

4

a high growth temperature (1750◦C) result in substantial Na vacancy formation during crystal
synthesis. Since the Na atoms are a charge reservoir for the (Mo6Se6)∞ chains, these vacancies will

reduce EF and lead to an incommensurate band ﬁlling. Despite the reduction in carrier density,
the density of states N (EF ) remains constant for Na1.5→2.1 (SI section I). Energy-dispersive X-ray

spectrometry on our crystals indicates Na contents from 1.7 to 2, comfortably within this range.

This is conﬁrmed by synchrotron X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) on three randomly-chosen crystals:
structural reﬁnements reveal Na deﬁciencies of 11±1%, 11±2% and 13±4% (i.e. δ = 0.22, 0.22,
0.26), but the (Mo6Se6)∞ chains remain highly ordered. No deviation from the M2Mo6Se6

structure is observed between 293 K and 20 K, ruling out any lattice distortions such as the Peierls

transition, which often aﬄicts q1D metals. To probe the Na vacancy distribution, we perform

diﬀuse X-ray scattering experiments on the δ = 0.26 crystal. No trace of any Huang scattering

(from clustered Na vacancies) or structured diﬀuse scattering from short-range vacancy ordering

is observed (Fig. S3, SI section II). Na vacancies therefore create an intrinsic, random disorder

potential in Na2−δMo6Se6 single crystals.

Normal-state electrical transport

We ﬁrst examine the electrical transport at high energy for signatures of disorder and one-

dimensionality. The temperature dependence of the resistivity ρ(T ) for 6 randomly-selected

Na2−δMo6Se6 crystals A-F is shown in Fig. 2a. ρ(300K) increases by more than one order of

magnitude from crystal A to F : such large diﬀerences between crystals cannot be attributed to

changes in the carrier density due to Na stoichiometry variation and must instead arise from disor-

der. Despite the variance in ρ(300K), the evolution of ρ(T ) is qualitatively similar in all crystals.

Upon cooling, ρ(T ) exhibits metallic behaviour before passing through a broad minimum at Tmin
and diverging at lower temperature. Tmin falls from 150 K to ∼ 70 K as ρ(300K) decreases (Fig. 2b),

to competing charge instabilities,8 or that signatures of TLL behaviour may persist even for T < Tx.6 Inset:

weak negative MR below H = 3 T may be a signature of enhanced quasiparticle tunnelling: in a spatially-

inhomogeneous superconductor, magnetic ﬁeld-induced pair-breaking in regions where the superconducting

order parameter is weak can increase the quasiparticle density and hence reduce the electrical resistance.

suggesting that the divergence in ρ(T ) and the disorder level are linked.

Upturns or divergence in ρ(T ) have been widely reported in q1D materials and variously at-

tributed to localisation,20–24 multiband TLL physics,25 DW formation,26,27 incipient density ﬂuctu-

ations16 and proximity to Mott instabilities.8 Diﬀerentiating between these mechanisms has proved

challenging, in part due to the microscopic similarity between localised electrons and randomly-

pinned DWs in 1D. We brieﬂy remark that the broad minimum in ρ(T ) in Na2−δMo6Se6 contrasts
strongly with the abrupt jumps in ρ(T ) for nesting-driven DW materials such as NbSe3,28 while

any Mott transition will be suppressed due to the non-stoichiometric Na content.

Instead, a disordered TLL provides a natural explanation for this unusual crossover from metallic
to insulating behaviour. At temperatures T (cid:38) t⊥, power-law behaviour in ρ(T ) is a signature of
TLL behaviour in a q1D metal. Fitting ρ ∝ T α in the high-temperature metallic regime of our
crystals consistently yields 1 < α < 1.01 (Fig. 2a). In a clean half-ﬁlled TLL, this would correspond
to a Luttinger parameter Kρ = (α + 3)/4 ∼ 1, i.e. non-interacting electrons. However, disorder
renormalises the e−-e− interactions: for a commensurate chain of spinless fermions, α = 2Kρ−2 and
a critical point separates localised from delocalised ground states at Kρ = 3/2.6 Our experimental
values for α therefore indicate that Na2−δMo6Se6 lies close to this critical point. Although the

eﬀects of incommensurate band ﬁlling on a disordered TLL remain unclear, comparison with clean

TLLs suggests that removing electrons reduces Kρ. For 1 < Kρ < 3/2, ρ(T ) is predicted to

be metallic at high temperature, before passing through a minimum at Tmin (which rises with

increasing disorder) and diverging at lower temperature. These features are consistently reproduced

in our data.

Within the disordered TLL paradigm, our high-temperature transport data indicate that the
e−-e− interaction is attractive, i.e. Kρ > 1. This implies that electron-phonon coupling dominates
over Coulomb repulsion and suggests that the Coulomb interaction may be intrinsically screened

in Na2−δMo6Se6. A quantitative analysis of the low-temperature divergence in ρ(T ) provides fur-

ther support for the inﬂuence of disorder as well as a weak/screened Coulomb repulsion. We

have attempted to ﬁt ρ(T ) using a wide variety of resistive mechanisms: gap formation (Arrhe-

nius activation), repulsive TLL power laws, weak and strong localisation (SI section III, Fig. S4).

Among these models, only Mott variable range hopping29 (VRH) consistently provides an accu-

rate description of our data. VRH describes charge transport by strongly-localised electrons: in a

d-dimensional material ρ(T ) = ρ0 exp[(T0/T )ν], where T0 is the characteristic VRH temperature
(which rises as the disorder increases) and ν = (1 + d)−1. Although Mott’s original model assumed

that hopping occurred via inelastic electron-phonon scattering, VRH has also been predicted to
occur via e−-e− interactions in disordered TLLs.30

Figure 3a displays VRH ﬁts for crystals A-F , yielding values for d ranging from 1.2 to 1.7 (SI

section III), in good agreement with the d = 1.5 predicted for arrays of disordered conducting

chains.31 Coulomb repulsion in disordered materials opens a soft (quadratic) gap at EF , leading to

VRH transport with d = 1 regardless of the actual dimensionality. We consistently observe d > 1,

implying that localised states are present at EF and no gap develops in Na2−δMo6Se6. A small

paramagnetic contribution also emerges in the dc magnetization below Tmin and rises non-linearly

8

with 1/T (Fig. S6). Similar behaviour has previously been attributed to a progressive crossover

from Pauli to Curie paramagnetism due to electron localisation (SI section IV).

Although ρ(T ) exhibits VRH divergence in all crystals prior to peaking at Tpk, a dramatic

increase in ρ(Tpk) by four orders of magnitude occurs between crystals C and D. This is reminiscent

of the rapid rise in resistivity upon crossing the mobility edge in disordered 3D materials. Our data

are therefore suggestive of a crossover to strong localisation and the existence of a critical disorder

or “q1D mobility edge”. Such behaviour may also originate from proximity to the Kρ = 3/2 critical

point. Interestingly, the critical disorder approximately correlates with the experimental condition
Tmin ∼ Tx, where Tx is the estimated single-particle dimensional crossover temperature (Fig. 2b).
This suggests a possible role for dimensional crossover in establishing the mobility edge.

Further evidence for criticality is seen in the frequency dependence of the conductivity σ(ω)

within the divergent ρ(T ) regime (Fig. 3b). For crystals with sub-critical disorder, σ(ω) remains

constant at low frequency, as expected for a disordered metal. In contrast, σ(ω) in samples with

super-critical disorder rises with frequency, following a ω2 ln(1/ω2) trend. This is quantitatively

compatible with both the Mott-Berezinskii formula for localised non-interacting electrons in 1D18

and the expected behaviour of a disordered chain of interacting fermions.6,32 The strong variation

of σ(ω) even at sub-kHz frequencies implies that the localisation length ξL is macroscopic, in
contrast with the ξL ∼ (T 1/d
0 NEF )−1 (cid:46) 100 nm expected from Mott VRH theory.33 However, it
has been predicted that the relevant localisation lengthscale for a weakly-disordered q1D crystal is

the Larkin (phase distortion) length, which may be exponentially large.31

The evolution of the magnetoresistance (MR) ρ(H) with temperature also supports a locali-

sation scenario. Above Tmin, ρ(H) is weakly positive and follows the expected H 2 dependence

for an open Fermi surface (Fig. 3c). At lower temperature, the divergence in ρ(T ) correlates

with a crossover to strongly negative MR within the VRH regime (Fig. 3d). The presence of a

soft Coulomb gap at EF would lead to a positive MR within the VRH regime34; in contrast,
our observed negative MR in Na2−δMo6Se6 corresponds to a delocalisation of gapless electronic
states19 and provides additional evidence for a screened Coulomb interaction. The MR switches

sign again below Tpk and becomes positive (Fig. 3e): as we shall now demonstrate, this is a

signature of superconductivity.

Superconducting transitions in Na2−δMo6Se6
The presence of a superconducting ground state15,16,35 in Tl2Mo6Se6 and In2Mo6Se6 implies
that the peak in ρ(T ) below 6 K is likely to signify the onset of superconductivity in Na2−δMo6Se6.

9

Upon cooling crystals A − C in a dilution refrigerator, we uncover a 2-step superconducting tran-
sition characteristic of strongly anisotropic q1D superconductors35–38 (Figs. 4a-c). Below Tpk,
superconducting ﬂuctuations initially develop along individual (Mo6Se6)∞ chains and ρ(T ) is well-

described by a 1D phase slip model (SI section V). Subsequently, a weak hump in ρ(T ) emerges
at temperatures ranging from ∼ 0.95 K (crystal A) to ∼ 1.7 K (crystal C). This hump signi-
ﬁes the onset of transverse phase coherence due to inter-chain coupling. Cooper pairs can now

tunnel between the chains and a Meissner eﬀect is expected to develop, but we are unable to

observe this since 1.7 K lies below the operational range of our magnetometer. Analysis of the

current-voltage characteristics indicates that a phase-coherent superconducting ground state is in-

deed established at low temperature (Fig. S5). We estimate an anisotropy ξ///ξ⊥ = 6.0 in the

coherence length, which is lower than the experimental values for Tl2Mo6Se6 and In2Mo6Se6 (13
and 17 respectively)16 in spite of the smaller t⊥ in Na2−δMo6Se6 (Fig. S2; see Methods for magnetic

ﬁeld orientation details). This anisotropy is also far smaller than the measured conductivity ratio

(cid:113)

at 300K:

σ///σ⊥ = 57.

In comparison, close agreement is obtained between the anisotropies

in ξ//,⊥ and σ//,⊥ for Li0.9Mo6O17,39 where the eﬀects of disorder are believed to be weak.8 The
disparate anisotropies in Na2−δMo6Se6 arise from a strong suppression of ξ//, thus illustrating the
essential role of disorder in controlling the low temperature properties of Na2−δMo6Se6.

Although superconducting ﬂuctuations are observed regardless of the level of disorder in

Na2−δMo6Se6, it is important to identify whether phase-coherent long range order develops in

crystals D-F which exhibit super-critical disorder.

In Figs. 4d-f we demonstrate that ρ(T ) in

these samples still follows a 1D phase slip model, albeit with a strongly enhanced contribution

from quantum phase slips due to the increased disorder40 (SI section V). A weak Meissner eﬀect
develops in the magnetization below ∼ 3.5 K in crystals D and E, but is rapidly suppressed by
a magnetic ﬁeld. Low transverse phase stiﬀness is common in q1D superconductors: for example,

bulk phase coherence in carbon nanotube arrays is quenched by 2-3 T, yet pairing persists up to

28 T.36 The superconducting volume fraction corresponding to the magnitude of this Meissner

eﬀect is also unusually low: < 0.1%. Magnetic measurements of the superconducting volume

fraction in Q1D materials invariably yield values below 100%, since the magnetic penetration

depth λab normal to the 1D axis can reach several microns16 and diamagnetic ﬂux exclusion is
incomplete. For a typical Na2−δMo6Se6 crystal of diameter d ∼ 100 µm, we estimate that a 0.1%
volume fraction would require λab ∼ 10 µm, which seems excessively large. Conversely, an array of
phase-ﬂuctuating 1D superconducting ﬁlaments would not generate any Meissner eﬀect at all. We

therefore attribute the unusually small Meissner signal to inhomogeneity in the superconducting

ﬂowing percolatively through each network will be much smaller than that in a homogeneous

sample due to the smaller d/λab ratio, thus diminishing the Meissner eﬀect.

Enhancement of superconductivity by disorder

We have established a clear inﬂuence of disorder on electrical transport in Na2−δMo6Se6

(Figs. 2,3) and demonstrated that the peak in ρ(T ) at Tpk corresponds to the onset of super-

conductivity (Fig. 4). Let us now examine the eﬀects of disorder on the superconducting ground

state. Figure 5a illustrates Tpk rising monotonically from crystal A to F . Plotting Tpk as a function

of ρ(300K) (which is an approximate measure of the static disorder in each crystal), we observe

a step-like feature between crystals C and D, i.e. at the critical disorder. Strikingly, the charac-

teristic VRH temperature T0 which we extract from our ρ(T ) ﬁts (Fig. 3a) displays an identical

dependence on ρ(300K). This implies that disorder controls both the superconducting ground state

and the insulating tendency in ρ(T ) at low temperature. The positive correlation between Tpk and

T0 (Fig. 5b) conﬁrms that the onset temperature for superconducting ﬂuctuations (and hence the
pairing energy ∆0) is enhanced by localisation in Na2−δMo6Se6. A concomitant increase in the

transverse coherence temperature (SI section VI) implies that some enhancement in the phase

stiﬀness also occurs.

Super-critical disorder furthermore enables superconducting ﬂuctuations to survive in high mag-

netic ﬁelds (Fig. 5c). In crystal C (which lies below the q1D mobility edge), superconductivity is
completely quenched at all temperatures (i.e. Tpk → 0) by H = 4 T. A giant negative MR reap-
pears for H > 4 T (Fig. 3e), conﬁrming that superconductivity originates from pairing between

localised electrons. In contrast, the peak at ρ(Tpk) in the highly-disordered crystal F is strikingly

resistant to magnetic ﬁelds: at T = 4.6 K, our observed Hc2 = 14 T which exceeds the weak-

coupling Pauli pair-breaking limit HP = 3 T by a factor > 4 (see SI section VII for a derivation

of HP (T )). A similar resilience is evident from the positive MR in crystal D, which persists up
to at least 14 T at 1.8 K (Fig. 3e). Triplet pairing is unlikely to occur in Na2−δMo6Se6 (since

scattering would rapidly suppress a nodal order parameter) and orbital limiting is also suppressed

(since vortices cannot form across phase-incoherent ﬁlaments). Our data therefore suggest that

disorder lifts HP , creating anomalously strong correlations which raise the pairing energy ∆0

10,11

above the weak-coupling 1.76kBTpk. A direct spectroscopic technique would be required to deter-

mine the absolute enhancement of ∆0, since spin-orbit scattering from the heavy Mo ions will also

contribute to raising HP .

II. DISCUSSION

The emergence of a superconducting ground state in Na2−δMo6Se6 places further constraints

on the origin of the normal-state divergence in ρ(T ). Our electronic structure calculations indicate

that the q1D Fermi surface of Na2−δMo6Se6 is almost perfectly nested: any incipient electronic

DW would therefore gap the entire Fermi surface, creating clear signatures of a gap in ρ(T ) and

leaving no electrons at EF to form a superconducting condensate. In contrast, our VRH ﬁts and

MR data do not support the formation of a DW gap, and a superconducting transition occurs at

low temperature. Electrons must therefore remain at EF for all T > Tpk, indicating that ρ(T )

diverges due to disorder-induced localisation rather than any other insulating instability.

It has been known since the 1950s that an s-wave superconducting order parameter is resilient

to disorder,44,45 provided that the localisation length ξL remains larger than the coherence length

(i.e. the Cooper pair radius). However, experiments have invariably shown superconductivity to

be destroyed by disorder, due to enhanced Coulomb pair-breaking,9 phase ﬂuctuations42,46,47 or

emergent spatial inhomogeneity.10,48 In particular, increasing disorder in Li0.9Mo6O17 (one of the

13

few q1D superconductors extensively studied in the literature) monotonically suppresses supercon-

ductivity.49 Therefore, the key question arising from our work is why the onset temperature for

superconductivity rises with disorder in Na2−δMo6Se6, in contrast to all other known materials?
Disorder acts to enhance the matrix element for e−-e− interactions. This may be explained qual-

itatively by considering that all conduction electron wavefunctions experience the same disorder-

induced potential, developing inhomogeneous multifractal probability densities50 and hence becom-

ing spatially correlated. Such enhanced correlations have been predicted to increase the Cooper

pairing energy10:

in the absence of pair-breaking by long-ranged Coulomb interactions, this will

lead to a rise in the superconducting transition temperature.11–13 A proposal to observe this eﬀect

in superconducting heterostructures with built-in Coulomb screening51 (by depositing supercon-

ducting thin ﬁlms on substrates with high dielectric constants) has not yet been experimentally

realised. However, our VRH dimensionality d > 1 (Fig. 3a) and negative MR (Fig. 3d,e) both point

towards a weak or screened Coulomb repulsion, while the power-laws and broad minima in ρ(T )

at high temperature (Fig. 2) indicate a Luttinger parameter Kρ > 1. These results all imply that
e−-e− interactions in Na2−δMo6Se6 are attractive. (For comparison, Kρ ∼ 0.25 in Li0.9Mo6O17 and
the e−-e− interaction is repulsive.)7,8 Phonon-mediated coupling - the “Cooper channel” - there-
fore appears to dominate over the Coulomb repulsion in Na2−δMo6Se6, suggesting that the usual

disorder-induced Coulomb pair-breaking may be avoided. Below the q1D mobility edge, our rise

in Tpk is quantitatively compatible with a weak multifractal scenario (SI section VIII), providing

a possible explanation for the enhancement of superconductivity which merits further theoretical

attention.

The fact that no experimental examples of q1D materials with attractive e−-e− interactions
have yet been reported poses the question why Na2−δMo6Se6 should be diﬀerent. Although strong

electron-phonon coupling is known to play an important role in the physics of molybdenum cluster

compounds,16,52 we propose that the disordered q1D nature of Na2−δMo6Se6 may instead play

the dominant role, by suppressing the Coulomb repulsion.

In the presence of disorder, a q1D

material can be regarded as a parallel array of “interrupted strands”,53 i.e. a bundle of ﬁnite-length

nanowires. The electric polarisability of metallic nanoparticles is strongly enhanced relative to

bulk materials,54 although this eﬀect is usually cancelled out by self-depolarisation. The geometric

depolarisation factor vanishes for q1D symmetry, leading to giant dielectric constants  which

rise as the ﬁlament length increases.55 This eﬀect was recently observed in Au nanowires,56 with 

reaching 107. In Na2−δMo6Se6, we therefore anticipate that the long-range Coulomb repulsion in an
individual (Mo6Se6)l ﬁlament (l < ∞) will be eﬃciently screened by neighbouring ﬁlaments.31 This

14

intrinsic screening provides a natural explanation for attractive e−-e− interactions and suppresses

Coulomb pair-breaking in the superconducting phase.

It has been suggested that impurities can increase the temperature at which transverse phase

coherence is established in q1D superconductors.57 This eﬀect cannot be responsible for our ob-

served rise in Tpk, which corresponds to the onset of 1D superconducting ﬂuctuations on individual

(Mo6Se6)l ﬁlaments. We also point out that the ﬁnite-size eﬀects which inﬂuence critical temper-
atures in granular58 or nanomaterials59 are not relevant in Na2−δMo6Se6: quantum conﬁnement

is absent in homogeneously-disordered crystalline superconductors and hence no peaks form in

N (EF ). These mechanisms are discussed in detail in section IX of the SI.

In summary, we have presented experimental evidence for the enhancement of superconductivity

by disorder in Na2−δMo6Se6. The combination of q1D crystal symmetry (and the associated

dimensional crossover), disorder and incommensurate band ﬁlling in this material poses a challenge

to existing 1D/q1D theoretical models. In the low-temperature normal state, we establish several

unusual transport properties which deserve future attention, including a resistivity which diverges

following a q1D VRH law for all levels of disorder, the existence of a critical disorder or q1D mobility
edge where Tmin ≈ Tx, and a strongly frequency-dependent conductivity σ(ω) ∼ ω2 in crystals with
super-critical disorder. At temperature Tpk, 1D superconducting ﬂuctuations develop, and a phase-

coherent ground state is established via coupling between 1D ﬁlaments at lower temperature. As

the disorder rises, Tpk increases: in our most-disordered crystals, the survival of superconducting

ﬂuctuations in magnetic ﬁelds at least four times larger than the Pauli limit suggests that the

pairing energy may be unusually large.

We conclude that deliberately introducing disorder into q1D crystals represents a new path

towards engineering correlated electron materials, in remarkable contrast with the conventional

blend of strong Coulomb repulsion and a high density of states. Beyond enhancing superconduc-

tivity, the ability to simultaneously modulate band ﬁlling, disorder and dimensionality promises a

high level of control over emergent order, including density waves and magnetic phases. More gen-

erally, Na2−δMo6Se6 and other similar “interrupted strand” materials may be ideal environments

in which to study the evolution of many-body electron localisation beyond the non-interacting

Anderson limit.

III. METHODS

Crystal growth and initial characterisation

A series of Na2−δMo6Se6 crystals was grown using a solid-state synthesis procedure. The precursor materials were MoSe2,

15

InSe, Mo and NaCl, all in powder form. Before use, the Mo powder was reduced under H2 gas ﬂowing at 1000◦C for ten
hours, in order to eliminate any trace of oxygen. The MoSe2 was prepared by reacting Se with H2-reduced Mo in a ratio 2:1
inside a purged, evacuated and ﬂame-baked silica tube (with a residual pressure of ∼ 10−4 mbar argon), which was then heated
to ∼ 700◦C for two days. InSe was synthesised from elemental In and Se in an evacuated sealed silica tube at 800◦C for 1
day. Powder samples of Na2−δMo6Se6 were prepared in two steps. Firstly, In2Mo6Se6 was synthesised from a stoichiometric
mixture of InSe, MoSe2 and Mo, heated to 1000◦C in an evacuated sealed silica tube for 36 hours. Secondly, an ion exchange
reaction of In2Mo6Se6 with NaCl was performed at 800◦C, using a 10% NaCl excess to ensure total exchange as described in
ref..60 All starting reagents were found to be monophase on the basis of their powder X-ray diﬀraction patterns, acquired using

a D8 Bruker Advance diﬀractometer equipped with a LynxEye detector (CuKα1 radiation). Furthermore, in order to avoid

any contamination by oxygen and moisture, the starting reagents were kept and handled in a puriﬁed argon-ﬁlled glovebox.

To synthesise single crystals, a Na2−δMo6Se6 powder sample (of mass ∼ 5 g) was cold-pressed and loaded into a molyb-
denum crucible, which had previously been outgassed at 1500◦C for 15 minutes under a dynamic vacuum of ∼ 10−5 mbar.
The Mo crucible was subsequently sealed under a low argon pressure using an arc-welding system. The Na2−δMo6Se6 powder
charge was heated at a rate of 300◦C/hour up to 1750◦C, held at this temperature for 3 hours, then cooled at 100◦C/hour
down to 1000◦C and ﬁnally cooled naturally to room temperature within the furnace. Crystals obtained using this proce-
dure have a needle-like shape with length up to 4mm and a hexagonal cross section with typical diameter ≤ 150 µm. Initial
semi-quantitative microanalyses using a JEOL JSM 6400 scanning electron microscope equipped with an Oxford INCA energy-

dispersive-type X-ray (EDX) spectrometer indicated that the Na contents ranged between 1.7 and 2, i.e. up to 15% deﬁciency.

The Na deﬁciency results from the high temperatures used during the crystal growth process coupled with the small size of the

Na ion: it cannot be accurately controlled within the conditions necessary for crystal growth.

Since In2Mo6Se6 is known to be superconducting below 2.85 K,16 it is important to consider the possibility of In con-
tamination in our samples. The Na/In ion exchange technique used during synthesis is known to be highly eﬃcient60,61 and
In2Mo6Se6 decomposes above 1300◦C, well below our crystal growth temperature (1750◦C). This precludes the presence of any
superconducting In2Mo6Se6 (or In-rich (In,Na)2Mo6Se6) ﬁlaments in our crystals. Diﬀuse X-ray scattering measurements

accordingly reveal none of the Huang scattering or disk-like Bragg reﬂections which would be produced by such ﬁlaments.

Furthermore, EDX spectrometry is unable to detect any In content in our crystals, while inductively-coupled plasma mass

spectrometry indicates a typical In residual of less than 0.01%, i.e. < 0.0002 In atoms per unit cell. The electronic properties
of Na2−δMo6Se6 crystals will remain unaﬀected by such a tiny In residual in solid solution.

Electrical transport measurements

Before all measurements, the as-grown crystal surfaces were brieﬂy cleaned with dilute hydrochloric acid (to remove any residue

from the Mo crucible and hence minimise the contact resistance), followed by distilled water, acetone and ethanol. Four Au

contact pads were sputtered onto the upper surface and sides of each crystal using an Al foil mask; 50 µm Au wires were
then glued to these pads using silver-loaded epoxy cured at 70◦C (Epotek E4110). Especial care was taken to thoroughly coat
each end of the crystal with epoxy, to ensure that the measurement current passed through the entire crystal. All contacts

were veriﬁed to be Ohmic at room temperature before and after each series of transport measurements, and at T = 4 K after
cooling. Typical contact resistances were of the order of 2 Ω at 300 K. The transverse conductivity σ⊥ was estimated at

room temperature using a four-probe technique, with contacts on opposite hexagonal faces of a single crystal. The temperature
dependence of the transverse resistivity ρ⊥(T ) has never been accurately measured in M2Mo6Se6 due to the exceptionally

large anisotropies, small crystal diameters and high fragility, even in the least anisotropic Tl2Mo6Se6 which forms the largest
crystals.15

Low-frequency four-wire ac conductivity measurements were performed in two separate cryogen-free systems: a variable

temperature cryostat and a dilution refrigerator, both of which may be used in conjunction with a superconducting vector

magnet. The ac conductivity was measured using a Keithley 6100 current source, a Stanford SRS850 lock-in ampliﬁer and a

Stanford SR550 preampliﬁer with input impedance 100 MΩ. Data from several crystals were cross-checked using a Quantum

Design Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS) with the standard inbuilt ac transport hardware: both methods generate

identical, reproducible data. With the exception of the frequency-dependence studies in Fig. 3b, all the transport data which

we present in our manuscript are acquired with an ac excitation frequency of 1 Hz, i.e. we are measuring in the dc limit. At

16

1 Hz, the phase angle remained zero at all temperatures in all crystals. Therefore, no extrinsic capacitance eﬀects are present

in our data.

The typical resistance of a weakly disordered crystal lies in the 1-10 Ω range. In contrast, the absolute resistances of
crystals D− F at Tpk are 41.9 kΩ, 33.7kΩ and 27.6kΩ respectively: the crystal diameter increases from D− F , thus explaining
the rise in resistivity despite a fall in resistance. These values remain much smaller than our preampliﬁer input impedance,

ruling out any current leakage in highly disordered crystals. Our measurement current Iac = 10 µA leads to a maximum power
dissipation < 10 µW. This is negligible compared with the ∼ 2 mW cooling power at 2K on our cryostat cold ﬁnger and we
may hence rule out any sample heating eﬀects in our data.

We acquire transverse magnetotransport data (Figs. 3c-e, 5c) with the magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular to both the c axis
and the crystal faces, i.e. at 30◦ to the hexagonal a axis. Q1D Bechgaard salts and blue/purple bronzes exhibit monoclinic
crystal symmetry, and hence strong anisotropies along all three crystallographic axes.
In contrast, M2Mo6Se6 crystallise
in a hexagonal lattice: any azimuthal (⊥ c) anisotropy in Na2−δMo6Se6 will therefore reﬂect this hexagonal symmetry. In
Tl2Mo6Se6, this anisotropy has been variously reported to be small or entirely absent: it is at least an order of magnitude
lower than the polar anisotropy at low temperature.62 Our conclusions regarding the reduced low temperature anisotropy in
Na2−δMo6Se6 are therefore robust.

In common with most highly one-dimensional materials, Na2−δMo6Se6 crystals are extremely fragile, with a tendency to

split into a forest of tangled ﬁbres if mishandled. The crystals therefore exhibit a ﬁnite experimental lifetime, with thermal

cycling from 2 K to room temperature presenting a particular risk to their structural integrity: this explains why we were

unable to obtain “complete” data-sets in crystals A-F (the magnetoresistance ρ(H) at high temperature in crystal C and χ(T )

in Crystal F are missing, for example).
