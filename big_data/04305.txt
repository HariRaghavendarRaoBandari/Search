OPTIMAL CONTROL OF THE THERMISTOR PROBLEM IN

THREE SPATIAL DIMENSIONS

H. MEINLSCHMIDT†, C. MEYER‡, J. REHBERG§

Abstract. This paper is concerned with the state-constrained optimal control of the three-
dimensional thermistor problem, a fully quasilinear coupled system of a parabolic and elliptic PDE
with mixed boundary conditions. This system models the heating of a conducting material by means
of direct current. Local existence, uniqueness and continuity for the state system are derived by
employing maximal parabolic regularity in the fundamental theorem of Pr¨uss. Global solutions are
addressed, which includes analysis of the linearized state system via maximal parabolic regularity,
and existence of optimal controls is shown if the temperature gradient is under control. The adjoint
system involving measures is investigated using a duality argument. These results allow to derive
ﬁrst-order necessary conditions for the optimal control problem in form of a qualiﬁed optimality
system. The theoretical ﬁndings are illustrated by numerical results.

the boundary measure ω). In addition, for the boundary we have ΓD ˙∪ ΓN = ∂Ω,
where ΓD is closed within ∂Ω. The functions η(·)κ and σ(·)ε represent heat- and
electric conductivity. While κ and ε are given, prescribed functions, η and σ are
allowed to depend on the temperature θ. Moreover, α is the heat transfer coeﬃcient
and θl and θ0 are given boundary– and initial data, respectively. Finally, u stands for
a current which is induced via the boundary part ΓN and is to be controlled. The
bounds in the optimization problem (P) as well as the desired temperature θd are
given functions and β is the usual Tikhonov regularization parameter. The precise
assumptions on the data in (P) and (1.1)–(1.6) will be speciﬁed in §2. In all what
follows, the system (1.1)–(1.6) is frequently also called state system.

The PDE system (1.1)–(1.6) models the heating of a conducting material by
means of a direct current, described by u, induced on the part ΓN of the boundary,
which is done for some time T1 − T0. At the grounding ΓD, homogeneous Dirichlet
boundary conditions are given, i.e., the potential is zero, inducing electron ﬂow. Note
that, usually, u will be zero on a subset ΓN0 of ΓN , which corresponds to having
insulation at this part of the boundary. We emphasize that the diﬀerent boundary
conditions are essential for a realistic modeling of the process. The objective of (P) is
to adjust the induced current u to minimize the L2-distance between the desired and
the resulting temperature at end time T1 on the set E ⊆ Ω, the latter representing the
area of the material in which one is interested – realized in the objective functional by
the ﬁrst term. The other terms are in present to minimize thermal stresses (second
term) and to ensure a certain smoothness of the controls (third term), whose inﬂuence
to the objective functional, however, may be controlled by the weights γ and β. The
actual form of these terms is motivated by functional-analytic considerations, see §4.1.
Moreover, the optimization is subject to pointwise control and state constraints. The
control constraints reﬂect a maximum heating power, while the state constraints limit
the temperature evolution to prevent possible damage, e.g. by melting of the material.
Similarly to the mixed boundary conditions, the inequality constraints in (P) are
essential for a realistic model as demonstrated by the numerical example within this
paper. Problem (P) is relevant in various applications, such as for instance the heat
treatment of steel by means of an electric current. The example considered in the
numerical part of this paper deals with an application of this type.

The state system (1.1)–(1.6) exhibits some non-standard features, in particular
due to the quasilinear coupling of the parabolic and the elliptic PDE, the mixed bound-
ary conditions in (1.5)–(1.6), and the inhomogeneity in the heat equation (1.1) as well
as the temperature-dependent heat conduction coeﬃcients. Besides the quasilinear
state system, the pointwise state constraints on the temperature represent another
challenging feature of the optimal control problem under consideration. The Lagrange
multipliers associated with constraints of this kind only provide poor regularity in
general, which especially complicates the analysis of the adjoint equation.

We brieﬂy describe the genuine aspects of our work. First of all, the discus-
sion of the quasilinear state system alone requires sophisticated up-to-date tools from
maximal elliptic and parabolic regularity theory. This concerns already local-in-time
existence for solutions of (1.5)–(1.6), let alone the characterization of global-in-time
solutions. The corresponding maximal regularity results were established only re-
cently, see e.g. [7, 33, 36] for the parabolic case and [43, Appendix], [19] for the elliptic
one. Our key ingredient for the proof of local-in-time existence is a general result of
Pr¨uss on quasilinear parabolic equations [50]. To verify the assumptions required for
the application of Pr¨uss’ result, we heavily rely on an isomorphism property of the

OPTIMAL CONTROL OF THE THERMISTOR PROBLEM

elliptic diﬀerential operators in both equations of the state system. Assuming this
isomorphism property only for the case of pure diﬀusion coeﬃcients κ and ε in the
diﬀerential operators, see Assumption 3.4 below, we show that the nonlinear diﬀer-
ential operators involving η(θ) and σ(θ) then also enjoy it, by a technique developed
in [43]. However, this analysis only guarantees the local-in-time existence, and the
counterexample in [6] involving a blow-up criterion for a similar model of the thermis-
tor system demonstrates that one can, in general, not expect global-in-time solutions.
Nevertheless, based on recent results on non-autonomous parabolic equations [48], we
prove that there are control functions that admit global-in-time solutions. Moreover,
using the implicit function theorem, we show that these control functions form an
open set, which is essential for the derivation of optimality conditions in qualiﬁed
form that are useful for numerical computations. Concerning the existence of global
minimizers for (P), we beneﬁt from the pointwise state constraints and the second
addend in the objective functional involving the gradient of the temperature. Both
terms prevent a blow-up of the temperature and its gradient and allow to restrict the
discussion of the optimization problem to control functions that admit a global-in-
time solution of the state system. This approach is inspired by [4], where a similar
technique was used to establish the existence of optimal controls.

Let us put our work into perspective. Up to the authors’ best knowledge, there
are only few contributions dealing with the optimal control of the thermistor prob-
lem. We refer to [45, 15, 41], where two-dimensional problems are discussed. In [45],
a completely parabolic problem is discussed, while [41] considers the purely elliptic
counterpart to (1.1)–(1.6). In [15, 5], the authors investigate a parabolic-elliptic sys-
tem similar to (1.1)–(1.6), assuming a particular structure of the controls. In contrast
to [45, 41], mixed boundary conditions are considered in [15]. However, all these con-
tributions do not consider pointwise state constraints and non-smooth data. Thus, (P)
diﬀers signiﬁcantly from the problems considered in the aforementioned papers. In a
previous paper [39], two of the authors investigated the two-dimensional counterpart
of (P). This contribution also accounts for mixed boundary conditions, non-smooth
data, and pointwise state constraints. However, the analysis in [39] substantially
diﬀers from the three dimensional case considered here. First of all, in two spatial
dimensions, the isomorphism-property of the elliptic operators mentioned above di-
rectly follows from the classical paper [30]. Moreover, the heat conduction coeﬃcient
in (1.1) is assumed not to depend on the temperature in [39]. Both features allow to
derive a global existence result for a suitable class of control functions. Hence, main
aspects of the present work do not appear in the two-dimensional setting. Let us
ﬁnally take a broader look on state-constrained optimal control problems governed by
PDEs. Compared to semilinear state-constrained optimal control problems, the liter-
ature concerning optimal control problems subject to quasilinear PDEs and pointwise
state constraints is rather scarce. We exemplarily refer to [13, 12], where elliptic prob-
lems are studied. The vast majority of papers in this ﬁeld deals with problems that
possess a well deﬁned control-to-state operator. By contrast, as indicated above, the
state-system (1.1)–(1.6) in general just admits local-in-time solutions, which requires
a sophisticated treatment of the optimal control problem under consideration.

The paper is organized as follows: We set the stage with notations and assump-
tions in §2 and discuss the state-system in §3. More precisely, §3.1 collects preliminary
results, also interesting in their own sake, while §3.2 is devoted to the actual proof of
existence and uniqueness of local-in-time solutions. We then proceed with the optimal
control problem in §4. Before stating ﬁrst order necessary conditions for (P) in §4.2,

4

we give suﬃcient conditions for controls to produce global solutions and establish con-
tinuous diﬀerentiability of the control-to-state operator for global solutions in §4.1.
The paper is wrapped-up with an illustrative numerical example in §5.

2. Notations and general assumptions. We introduce some notation and the
relevant function spaces. All function spaces under our consideration are real ones.
Let, for now, Ω be a domain in R3. We give precise geometric speciﬁcations for Ω in
§2.1 below.

Let us ﬁx some notations: The underlying time interval is called J = (T0, T1)
with T0 < T1. The boundary measure for the domain Ω is called ω. Generally, given
an integrability order q ∈ (1,∞), we denote the conjugated of q by q(cid:48), i.e., it always
holds 1/q + 1/q(cid:48) = 1.
Definition 2.1. For q ∈ (1,∞), let W 1,q(Ω) denote the usual Sobolev space on
Ω. If Ξ ⊂ ∂Ω is a closed part of the boundary ∂Ω, we set W 1,q
Ξ (Ω) to be the closure

0 (R3), supp ψ ∩ Ξ = ∅(cid:9) with respect to the W 1,q-norm.

of the set(cid:8)ψ|Ω : ψ ∈ C∞

The dual space of W 1,q(cid:48)
−1,q
∅

Ξ (Ω) is denoted by W

(Ω) for the dual of W 1,q(cid:48)

in particular, we write
W
(Ω) (see Remark 2.3 below regarding consistency).
The H¨older spaces of order δ on Ω or order  on Q are denoted by C δ(Ω) and C (Q),
respectively (note here that H¨older continuous functions on Ω or Q, respectively,
possess an unique uniformly continuous extension to the closure of the domain, such
that we will mostly use C δ(Ω) and C (Q) to emphasize on this).

−1,q
Ξ

(Ω);

instead of W 1,q

We will usually abbreviate the function spaces on Ω by leaving out the Ω, e.g. we
write W 1,q
Ξ (Ω) or Lp instead of Lp(Ω). Lebesgue spaces on subsets
Ξ
of ∂Ω are always to be considered with respect to the boundary measure ω, but
we abbreviate Lp(∂Ω, ω) by Lp(∂Ω) and do so analogously for any ω-measurable
subset of the boundary. The norm in a Banach space X will be always indicated by
(cid:107) · (cid:107)X . For two Banach spaces X and Y , we denote the space of linear, bounded
operators from X into Y by L(X; Y ). The symbol LH(X; Y ) stands for the set of
linear homeomorphisms between X and Y . If X, Y are Banach spaces which form
an interpolation couple, then we denote by (X, Y )τ,r the real interpolation space,
see [54]. We use M3 for the set of real, symmetric 3 × 3-matrices.
In the sequel,
a linear, continuous injection from X to Y is called an embedding, abbreviated by
X (cid:44)→ Y . For Lipschitz continuous functions f , we denote the Lipschitz constants by
Lf , while for bounded functions g we denote their bound by Mg (both over appropriate
sets, if necessary). Finally, c denotes a generic positive constant.

2.1. Geometric setting for Ω and ΓD. In all what follows, the symbol Ω
stands for a bounded Lipschitz domain in R3 in the sense of [47, Ch. 1.1.9]; cf. [35]
for the boundary measure ω on such a domain.

Remark 2.2. The thus deﬁned notion is diﬀerent from strong Lipschitz domain,
which is more restrictive and in fact identical with uniform cone domain, see again [47,
Ch. 1.1.9]).

A Lipschitz domain is formed e.g. by the topologically regularized union of two
crossing beams (see [33, Ch. 7]), which is not a strong Lipschitz domain. Moreover,
the interior of any three-dimensional connected polyhedron is a Lipschitz domain, if
the polyhedron is, simultaneously, a 3-manifold with boundary, cf. [32, Thm. 3.10].
However, a ball minus half of the equatorial plate is not a Lipschitz domain, and a
chisel, where the blade edge is bent onto the disc, is also not.
Remark 2.3. The Lipschitz property of Ω implies the existence of a linear,
continuous extension operator E : W 1,q(Ω) → W 1,q(R3) (see [26, p.165]). This has

OPTIMAL CONTROL OF THE THERMISTOR PROBLEM

the following consequences:

• Since any element from W 1,q(R3) may be approximated by smooth functions
in the W 1,q-norm, any element from W 1,q(Ω) may be approximated by re-
strictions of smooth functions in the W 1,q(Ω)-norm. This tells us that the
Ξ (Ω) are consistent in case of Ξ = ∅, i.e., one
deﬁnitions of W 1,q(Ω) and W 1,q
has W 1,q(Ω) = W 1,q∅ (Ω). See also the detailed discussion in [29, Ch. 1.3.2].
• It is not hard to see that E also provides a continuous extension operator
E : C δ(Ω) → C δ(R3) and E : Lp(Ω) → Lp(R3), where δ ∈ (0, 1), p ∈ [1,∞].
• Finally, the existence of the extension operator E provides the usual Sobolev
embeddings W 1,q(Ω) (cid:44)→ Lp(Ω).
In particular, this yields, by duality, the
embedding Lq/2(Ω) (cid:44)→ W

(Ω) if q exceeds the space dimension three.

−1,q
∅

K the left half of Σ, i.e. Σ0

Next we deﬁne the geometric setting for the domains Ω and the Dirichlet boundary
part. For this, we denote by K the open unit cube in Rn, centered at 0 ∈ Rn, by K−
the lower half cube K ∩ {x : xn < 0}, by ΣK = K ∩ {x : xn = 0} the upper plate of
K− and by Σ0

K = ΣK ∩ {x : xn−1 ≤ 0}.

Definition 2.4. Let Ξ ⊂ ∂Ω be closed within ∂Ω.
(i) We say that Ω∪Ξ is regular (in the sense of Gr¨oger), if for any point x ∈ ∂Ω
there is an open neighborhood Ux of x, a number ax > 0 and a bi-Lipschitz mapping φx
from Ux onto axK such that φx(x) = 0 ∈ R3, and we have either φx
axK− or ax(K− ∪ ΣK) or ax(K− ∪ Σ0

(cid:0)(Ω ∪ Ξ) ∩ Ux

(ii) The regular set Ω ∪ Ξ is said to satisfy the volume-conservation condition,

(cid:1) =

K).

if each mapping φx in Condition (i) is volume-preserving.

Generally, Ξ is allowed to be empty in Deﬁnition 2.4. Then Deﬁnition 2.4 (i)

merely describes a Lipschitz domain. Some further comments are in order:

Remark 2.5.

(i) Condition (i) exactly characterizes Gr¨oger’s regular sets, introduced in his
pioneering paper [30]. Note that the volume-conservation condition also has been
required in several contexts, cf. [27] and [31].
Clearly, the properties φx(Ux) = axK and φx
the Lipschitz property of Ω; the crucial point is the behavior of φx(Ξ ∩ Ux).

(cid:1) = axK− are already ensured by

(cid:0)Ω∩ Ux

(ii) A simplifying topological characterization of Gr¨oger’s regular sets in the case

of three space dimensions reads as follows (cf. [34, Ch. 5]):

1. Ξ is the closure of its interior within ∂Ω,
2. the boundary ∂Ξ within ∂Ω is locally bi-Lipschitz diﬀeomorphic to the open

unit interval (0, 1).

(iii) In particular, all domains with Lipschitz boundary (synonymous:

strong
Lipschitz domains) satisfy Deﬁnition 2.4: if, after a shift and an orthogonal trans-
formation, the domain lies locally beyond a graph of a Lipschitz function ψ, then one
can deﬁne φ(x1, . . . , xd) = (x1 − ψ(x2, . . . , xd), x2, . . . , xd). Obviously, the mapping φ
is then bi-Lipschitz and the determinant of its Jacobian is identically 1.

(iv) It turns out that regularity together with the volume-conservation condition
is not a too restrictive assumption on the mapping φx. In particular, there are such
mappings—although not easy to construct—which map the ball onto the cylinder, the
ball onto the cube and the ball onto the half ball, see [28, 23]. The general message is
that this class has enough ﬂexibility to map “non-smooth” objects onto smooth ones.
(v) The spaces W 1,q
still exhibit the usual interpolation properties,
Ξ
(vi) If Ξ is nonempty and Ω∪Ξ is regular, then Ξ has interior points (with respect
to the boundary topology in ∂Ω), and, consequently, never has boundary measure 0.

ations in the paper.

The following assumption is supposed to be valid for all the remaining consider-
Assumption 2.6. The set Ω ∪ ΓD is regular with ΓD (cid:54)= ∅.
For the moment, it is suﬃcient to impose only the regularity condition from
Assumption 2.6 (i) on Ω∪ ΓD. The volume-conservation condition is not needed until
Section 4, cf. Assumption 4.2 below. As explained in Remark 2.5, Assumption 2.6 in
particular implies that ω(ΓD) > 0.

2.2. General assumptions on (P). Now we are in the position to state the
main assumptions for the quantities in (P). Please note that in order to obtain sharp
results we just give the assumptions on the quantities in (1.1)–(1.6) which are needed
to obtain existence, uniqueness, and continuity of solutions to the state system. For
further considerations in §4, in particular those which include Fr´echet-diﬀerentiability
of the associated solution operator, one has to require more restrictive conditions on
the nonlinearities, which are formulated in Assumption 4.2, see §4.

We ﬁrst address the assumptions regarding (local) existence and uniqueness for
the state equation (1.1)–(1.6). This means in particular that we treat u as a ﬁxed,
given inhomogeneity in this context, whereas it is an unknown control function when
considering the optimal control problem (P).

(vi) β > 0.
Note that we do not impose any regularity assumptions on the function umax. In

particular, it is allowed that umax ≡ ∞ so that no upper bound is present.

3. Rigorous formulation, existence and uniqueness of solutions for the
thermistor problem. In this chapter we will present a precise analytical formula-
tion for the thermistor-problem, see Deﬁnition 3.11 below. In order to do so, we ﬁrst
recall some background material. One of the most crucial points is the requirement
of suitable mapping property for Poisson’s operator, cf. Assumption 3.4. The reader
should note that a similar condition was also posed in [6, Ch. 3] in order to get smooth-
ness of the solution; compare also [24], where exactly this regularity for the solution
of Poisson’s equation is needed in order to show uniqueness for the semiconductor
equations. We prove, in particular, some preliminary results which are needed later
on and which may be also of independent interest. After having properly deﬁned a
solution of the thermistor problem, we establish some more preparatory results and
afterwards show existence (locally in time) and uniqueness of the solution of the ther-
mistor problem in Section 3.2. Finally, we show that our concept to treat the problem
is not accidental, but—more or less—inevitable.

3.1. Prerequisites: Elliptic and parabolic regularity. We begin this sub-
section with the deﬁnition of the divergence operators. First of all, let us introduce the
brackets (cid:104)·,·(cid:105) as the symbol for the dual pairing between W
Ξ , extending
the scalar product in L2.
Definition 3.1. Let Ξ ⊂ ∂Ω be closed. Assume that µ is any bounded, measur-
able, M3-valued function on Ω and that γ ∈ L∞(∂Ω \ Ξ) is nonnegative. We deﬁne

Additionally, (3.3) implies that the mapping

is a linear and continuous contraction for every q ∈ (1,∞).
In the following, we consider the operators deﬁned in Deﬁnition 3.1 mostly in two
incarnations: ﬁrstly, the case Ξ = ∅ and µ = κ; and secondly Ξ = ΓD with µ = ε.
We write −∇ · κ∇ and −∇ · κ∇ + ˜α in the ﬁrst, and −∇ · ε∇ in the second case. We
recall various properties of operators of the form −∇ · µ∇.

See also [7] for recent results as in Proposition 3.3 (ii) in a broader context. Our
next aim is to introduce the solution concept for the thermistor problem. To this end,
we make the following assumption (cf. also Remark 3.25 below):

Assumption 3.4. There is a q ∈ (3, 4) such that the mappings

(3.5)

each provide a topological isomorphism.

The papers [43, Appendix] and [19] provide a zoo of arrangements such that
Assumption 3.4 is satisﬁed. Note that it is not presumptous to assume that both dif-
ferential operators provide topological isomorphisms at the same time, since the latter
property mainly depends on the behaviour of the discontinuous coeﬃcient functions
(versus the geometry of ΓD), and these correspond to the material properties in the
workpiece described by the domain Ω, i.e., the coeﬃcient functions should exhibit sim-
ilar properties with regard to jumps or discontinuities in general, the main obstacles
to overcome for the isomorphism property. Since κ is not assumed to be continuous,
Assumption (3.5) is not satisﬁed a priori, even though no mixed boundary conditions
are present, see [21, Ch. 4] for a striking example. In this sense, mixed boundary con-
ditions are not a stronger obstruction against higher regularity in the range q ∈ (3, 4)
than discontinuous coeﬃcient functions are.
Remark 3.5. In case of mixed boundary conditions it does not make sense to
demand Assumption 3.4—even if all data are smooth—for a q ≥ 4, due to Shamir’s
famous counterexample [52]. Note further that the isomorphism properties in (3.4)
and (3.5) remain valid for all other ˜q ∈ [2, q) due to interpolation, cf. Remark 2.5 (v).
In order to treat the quasilinearity in (1.1), we need to ensure a certain uniformity
of domains of the diﬀerential operator −∇· η(θ)κ∇ during the evolution. To this end,
we ﬁrst note that the isomorphism-property for −∇ · κ∇ + 1 from Assumption 3.4
extends to a broader class of coeﬃcient functions.

Definition 3.6. Let C(Ω) denote the set of positive functions on Ω which are
uniformly continuous and admit a positive lower bound.
Lemma 3.7. Assume that Assumption 3.4 holds for some number q ∈ [2, 4).
If ξ ∈ C(Ω), then (3.4) and (3.5) remain topological isomorphisms, if ε and κ are
replaced by ξε and ξκ, respectively.

, is still W 1,q.

A proof can be found in [19, Ch. 6].
Corollary 3.8. Assume that (3.5) is a topological isomorphism for some q ∈
[2, 4). Then, for every ξ ∈ C(Ω), the domain of the operator −∇· ξκ∇ + ˜α, considered
−1,q
In particular, for every function ζ ∈ C(Ω), the operator

−∇ · η(ζ)κ∇ + ˜α has domain W 1,q.
Proof. The ﬁrst assertion follows from Lemma 3.7 and relative compactness of the
boundary integral in ˜α with respect to −∇ · ξκ∇, compare [42, Ch. IV.1.3]. For the
second assertion, note that η is assumed to be Lipschitzian on bounded intervals and
bounded from below by 0 as in Assumption 2.7. Thus, η(ζ) is uniformly continuous
and has a strictly positive lower bound.

We are now in the position to deﬁne what is to be understood as a solution to

the system (1.1)–(1.6).

Definition 3.9. We deﬁne

A(ζ) := −∇ · η(ζ)κ∇ + ˜α

as a mapping A : C(Ω) → L(W 1,q; W

(3.8)

We call (θ, ϕ) a local solution, if it satisﬁes (3.6) and (3.7) in the above sense, but
only on (T0, T •) ⊆ (T0, T1).

Remark 3.12.

(i) In the context of Deﬁnition 3.11, θ(cid:48) always means the time derivative of θ

in the sense of vector-valued distributions, see [1, Ch. III.1] or [25, Ch. IV].
(ii) Via (3.10) and Corollary 3.20 below, we will see that a solution θ in the
above sense is in fact H¨older-continuous on Ω × J. In particular, θ(t) is uniformly
continuous on Ω for every t ∈ J, such that A(θ(t)) is well-deﬁned according to Deﬁ-
nition 3.9.

(iii) The reader will verify that the boundary conditions imposed on ϕ in (1.5)
and (1.6) are incorporated in this deﬁnition in the spirit of [25, Ch. II.2] or [14,
Ch. 1.2]. For an adequate interpretation of the boundary conditions for θ as in (1.2),
see [46, Ch. 3.3.2] and the in-book references there.

We are now going to formulate the main result of this part.
Theorem 3.13. Let q ∈ (3, 4) be a number for which Assumption 3.4 is sat-

) 1
r ,r, then there is a unique local solution
∅
of (3.6) and (3.7) in the sense of Deﬁnition 3.11.

The proof of this theorem is given in the next subsection.

3.2. Local existence and uniqueness for the state system: the proof.
Let us ﬁrst brieﬂy sketch the proof of Theorem 3.13 by giving an overview over the

steps:• The overall proof is based on a local existence result of Pr¨uss for abstract

quasilinear parabolic equations, whose principal part satisﬁes a certain max-
imal parabolic regularity property, see [50] and Proposition 3.17.
• For the application of this abstract result to our problem, we reduce the
thermistor system to an equation in the temperature θ only by solving the
elliptic equation for ϕ in dependence of θ. This gives rise to a nonlinear
operator S appearing in the reduced equation for θ, see Deﬁnition 3.26 and
Proposition 3.28.
• The key tool to verify the assumptions on S for the application of Pr¨uss’
result is Lemma 3.7, which is the basis for the proof of Lemma 3.27. The
application of Lemma 3.7 requires to treat the temperature in a space which
(compactly) embeds into C(Ω). This issue is addressed by Corollary 3.20.

Before we start with the proof itself, let us ﬁrst recall the concept of maximal
parabolic regularity, a crucial tool in the following considerations, and point out some
basic facts on this:
Definition 3.14. Let X be a Banach space and A be a closed operator with
dense domain dom(A) ⊂ X. Suppose r ∈ (1,∞). Then we say that A has maximal
parabolic Lr(J; X)-regularity, iﬀ for every f ∈ Lr(J; X) there is a unique function

OPTIMAL CONTROL OF THE THERMISTOR PROBLEM

w ∈ W 1,r(J; X) ∩ Lr(J; dom(A)) which satisﬁes

w(cid:48)(t) + Aw(t) = f (t), w(T0) = 0

11

(3.9)

in X for almost every t ∈ J = (T0, T1).

Remark 3.15.

(i) As in Remark 3.12, w(cid:48) in Deﬁnition 3.14 also always means the time deriva-

tive of w in the sense of vector-valued distributions.

(ii) We consider the concept of maximal parabolic regularity as adequate for the
solution since it allows for discontinuous (in time) right hand sides—as are required
in our context and in many other applications.

Remark 3.16. The following results on maximal parabolic Lr(J; X)-regularity

are well-known:

(i) If A satisﬁes maximal parabolic Lr(J; X)-regularity, then it does so for any
other (bounded) time interval, see [20].
(ii) If A satisﬁes maximal parabolic Lr(J; X)-regularity for some r ∈ (1,∞),
then it satisﬁes maximal parabolic Lr(J; X)-regularity for all r ∈ (1,∞), see [53]
or [20].
(iii) Let Y be another Banach space, being dense in X with Y (cid:44)→ X. Then there

is an embedding

W 1,r(J; X) ∩ Lr(J; Y ) (cid:44)→ C ρ(J; (Y, X)ζ,1)
where 0 < ρ ≤ ζ − 1
r , see [3, Ch. 3, Thm. 3]. In the immediate context of maximal
parabolic regularity, Y is taken as dom(A) equipped with the graph norm, of course.
According to (i) and (ii), we only say that A satisﬁes maximal parabolic regularity on
X.

(3.10)

In the following, we establish some preliminary results for the proof of Theo-
rem 3.13, which will heavily rest on the following fundamental theorem of Pr¨uss,
see [50]:
Proposition 3.17. Let Y, X be Banach spaces, Y dense in X, such that Y (cid:44)→ X
and set J = (T0, T1) and r ∈ (1,∞). Suppose that A maps (Y, X) 1

such that A(w0) satisﬁes maximal parabolic regularity on X with dom(A(w0)) = Y

Remark 3.18. It is known that the solution of the thermistor problem possibly
ceases to exist after ﬁnite time in general, cf. [6, Ch. 5] and the references therein.
Thus, one has to expect here, in contrast to the two-dimensional case treated in [39],
only a local-in-time solution. In this scope, Pr¨uss’ theorem will prove to be the ade-
quate instrument.

As indicated above, we will prove Theorem 3.13 by reducing the thermistor system
to an equation in the temperature only and apply Proposition 3.17 to this equation.
To be more precise, we ﬁrst establish the assumptions (A) for r = r > r∗(q) and A as
deﬁned in Deﬁnition 3.9. We then solve the elliptic equation (3.7) for ϕ (uniquely) for
every time point t in dependence of a function ζ and u(t), where ζ enters the equa-
tion inside the coeﬃcient function σ(ζ)ε. Then the right-hand side of the parabolic
equation (3.6) may be written also as a function S solely of t and ζ. We then show
that this function satisﬁes the suppositions (S) in Pr¨uss’ theorem.

assertion is implied by the ﬁrst, Remark 3.2 and the continuity of the mapping
LH(X; Y ) (cid:51) B (cid:55)→ B−1 ∈ LH(Y ; X), see [51, Ch. III.8].
Corollary 3.24. Let C ⊂ C(Ω) be a compact set in C(Ω) which admits a

Remark 3.25. At this point we are in the position to discuss the meaning of
Assumption 3.4 in some detail. Under Assumption 2.6 (i) for a closed subset Ξ
of ∂Ω, it is known that, even for arbitrary measurable, bounded, elliptic coeﬃcient
functions µ, (Dq, W
)τ,1 embeds into a H¨older space for suitable τ , cf. [34, Cor. 3.7]
(for Dq, see Remark 3.2). In particular, one does not need an assumption for the
ismorphism property between W 1,q
for this result. The crucial point behind
Assumption 3.4 is to achieve both independence of the domains for the operators
−∇φµ∇ within a suitable class of functions φ, as well as a well-behaved dependence
on φ in the space L(Dq; W

), cf. Lemma 3.7 and Corollaries 3.8 and 3.24.

Let us show the Lipschitz property of Ψ: First, note that Nemytskii operators induced

note further that the set of all σ(ζ) for ζ ∈ C admits a common positive lower bound
by the Lipschitz property of σ. Hence, the set {σ(ζ) : ζ ∈ C} satisﬁes the assumptions
in Lemma 3.22 and Corollary 3.24. For ζ1, ζ2 ∈ C and v1, v2 ∈ W

Note that this is the point where the supposition on the time-integrability of u

Now we have established all ingredients to prove Theorem 3.13. For this purpose,
let the assumptions of Theorem 3.13 hold. Combining Propositions 3.21 and 3.28

of (T∗, T1), “glue” the solutions together and start again (note that A(θ(t)) again
satisﬁes maximal parabolic regularity for every t ∈ [T∗, T1) by Corollary 3.20). As
we may let these intervals of local existence overlap, the uniqueness of local solutions
by Proposition 3.17 implies that the “glued” solution satisﬁes the claimed regularity
for the solutions as in (3.8). In this way, we either obtain a solution on the whole
prescribed interval (T0, T1) or end up with a maximal interval of existence, denoted
by Jmax = (T0, Tmax), such that there exists a solution θ in the above sense on every
interval (T0, T•) where T• ∈ Jmax (or equivalently (T0, T•] ⊂ (T0, Tmax)). The maximal
time of existence Tmax is characterized by the property that limt(cid:37)Tmax θ(t) does not

We end this chapter with some explanations why the chosen setting in spaces of
with q > 3 is adequate for the problem under consideration.
Let us inspect the requirements on the spaces in which the equations are formu-
lated. Clearly, they need to contain Lebesgue spaces on Ω as well as on the boundary
Γ (or on a subset of the boundary like ΓN ), in order to incorporate the nonhomogene-
nous Neumann boundary data present in both equations. The boundary conditions
should be reﬂected by the formulation of the equations in an adequate way, cf. Re-
mark 3.12 (iii). These demands already strongly prejudice spaces of type W
for
the parabolic equation and W
for the elliptic equation with probably diﬀerent
integrability orders qp and qe for each equation. Finally, in order to treat the nonlinear
parabolic equation, we need maximal parabolic regularity for the second order diver-
gence operators A(ζ) over W
, which is generally available by Corollary 3.20 (iii)
or [33, Thm. 5.16/Rem. 5.14] in a general context.

Further, aiming at continuous solutions θ, which are needed for having fulﬁllable
Constraint Qualiﬁcations for (P) in the presence of state constraints, it is necessary
that the domain Dqp (ζ) of the diﬀerential operators A(ζ), cf. Remark 3.2, embeds into
the space of continuous functions on Q. But it is known that solutions y to equations
−∇ · µ∇y = f for µ ∈ L∞(Ω, Mn) elliptic with f ∈ W
, where n denotes the
space dimension, may in general even be unbounded, see [44, Ch. 1.2]. On the other
hand, Dqp (ζ) embeds into a H¨older space if qp > 3, see Remark 3.2. These two facts
make the requirement qp > n = 3 expedient. Let us now assume that the elliptic
equation admits solutions whose gradient is integrable up to some order qg. Then the
right hand side in the parabolic equation prescribes qg ≥ 6qp
qp+3 in order to have the
embedding Lqg/2 (cid:44)→ W
. From the requirement qp > 3 then follows qg > 3 as well,
i.e., the elliptic equation must admit W 1,qg
-solutions with qg > 3. With right-hand
ΓD
, the best possible constellation is thus qe = qg > 3 again. Having qe
sides in W
and qp both in the same range, we simply choose q = qe = qp > 3.

functions may admit almost arbitrarily poor integrability properties for gradients of
their solutions, see [49] and [21, Ch. 4]. Under Assumption 3.4, we know that this is
not the case for −∇ · ε∇ over W
, but it is clear that it is practically impossible
to guarantee this also for the operators −∇ · σ(ζ)ε∇ for all ζ, if σ(ζ) is discontinuous
in general. However, from Lemma 3.7 we know that if σ(ζ) if uniformly continuous
on Ω, then the isomorphism property carries over. This shows that continuous so-
lutions for the parabolic equation are also needed purely from an analytical point of
view, without the considerations coming from the optimal control problem, and also
explains why Assumption 3.4 is, in a sense, a “minimal” assumption.

given in dependence of u and θu as in (3.18). Due to q > 3 and r > r∗(q), each
solution θu is H¨older-continuous on [T0, T•] × Ω, cf. Corollary 3.20 (ii).
Remark 4.1. As noted above, if the solution θu for a given control u does not
exist on the whole time interval J, there exists Tmax(u) ≤ T1, the maximal time of

Our aim in the following sections is to characterize the set of control functions
which admit a solution on the whole time interval. These control functions will be
called “global controls”, see Deﬁnition 4.3. In view of the state constraints and the
end time observation in the objective of (P), it is natural to restrict the optimal
control problem to the set of global controls. Our characterization of this set will
then allow to establish the existence of (globally) optimal controls. Let us give a brief
roadmap of the upcoming analysis:
• We ﬁrst show that the set of global controls is not empty, see Proposition 4.4,
and that it is an open set, cf. Theorem 4.5. This property will be of major im-
portance for the derivation of meaningful optimality conditions in Section 4.2.
• For global controls one can deﬁne a control-to-state operator in function
spaces on the whole time interval, see Deﬁnition 4.3. The proof of Theo-
rem 4.5 features an application of the implicit function theorem and thereby
shows that the control-to-state operator is Fr´echet-diﬀerentiable, which is also
essential for the derivation of necessary optimality conditions.
• We then turn to the existence of optimal controls. The arguments follow
the classical direct method of the calculus of variations, see Theorem 4.16.
To this end, we need to establish a closedness result for the set of global
controls in Theorem 4.9. This result requires a certain boundedness of the
gradient of the temperatures which is ensured by the second addend in the
objective in (P). To pass to the limit in the thermistor system, we addition-
ally need that the control space, induced by the third term in the objective
functional, compactly embeds into L2r(J; W 1,q
). This issue is addressed in
ΓD

18

Proposition 4.14.

• Finally, Section 4.2 is devoted to the derivation of necessary optimality condi-
tions. As the set of global controls is open, the standard generalized Karush-
Kuhn-Tucker theory applies, see Theorem 4.22. We then introduce an adjoint
system in Deﬁnition 4.23 and 4.24 and show by means of a classical duality
argument that this system admits a unique solution, cf. Theorem 4.26. This
allows to reformulate the necessary conditions in terms of a qualiﬁed opti-
mality system, see Theorem 4.28.

4.1. Global solutions and existence of optimal controls. In [6], Antont-
sev and Chipot show that it is possible to give concrete conditions under which the
solution to a thermistor-like problem does not exist globally. While the authors of [6]
consider a slightly diﬀerent setting (in particular no Robin boundary conditions for
the parabolic equation), we devote a subsection to the question whether there is any
relevant characterization of global controls u, i.e., controls such that the corresponding
solution (θu, ϕu) does exist on the whole (prescribed) interval J = (T0, T1).

We make the following assumption for the rest of this paper:
Assumption 4.2.
1. The functions η and σ, each mapping R → R+, are continuously diﬀeren-
tiable. The derivatives η(cid:48) and σ(cid:48) are each bounded and Lipschitz continuous
on bounded sets.
2. In addition to Assumption 2.6, we from now on require that Ω ∪ ΓD satisﬁes
Definition 4.3. We call a control u ∈ L2r(J; W
), r > r∗(q), a global
control if the corresponding solution θ exists on the whole prescribed interval (T0, T1)
and denote the set of global controls by Ug. Moreover, we deﬁne the control-to-state
operator

the volume-conservation condition from Deﬁnition 2.4 (ii).

on Ug.
Let us ﬁrstly show that the previous deﬁnition is in fact meaningful in the sense
that Ug (cid:54)= ∅. The natural candidate for a global control is u ≡ 0. One readily observes
that the control u ≡ 0 leads to the solution ϕ ≡ 0 for the elliptic equation (3.7), hence
the right-hand side in the parabolic equation reduces to αθl(t) in this case. Indeed,
we will show that there exists a global solution θu=0 to the equation

∂tθ + A(θ)θ = αθl,

θ(T0) = θ0.

(4.1)

In order to obtain a global solution to (4.1), we need the volume-conservation
condition. Under this additional assumption, the following result has been shown
in [48, Thm. 5.3]. Note that the case of Ω ∪ ΓD regular is only a special case of the
admissible geometries in [48].
Proposition 4.4. Assume that Ω ∪ Ξ is regular and in addition satisﬁes the
volume-conservation condition. Let µ be a coeﬃcient function on Ω, measurable,
bounded, elliptic. Assume that φ : R → [φ, φ], where φ > 0, is Lipschitz continuous
on bounded sets. Suppose further that

−∇ · µ∇ : W 1,q

which belongs to W 1,r(J; W

With w0 = θ0, Ξ = ∅, φ = η, µ = κ and f = αθl, we may use Proposition 4.4 to
ensure the existence of a global solution of (4.1) in the sense of Deﬁnition 3.11 under
Assumption 3.4 – in particular, 0 ∈ Ug follows. In [48], Proposition 4.4 is proven for
the case where the diﬀerential operator consists of the divergence-gradient operator
only. However, it is clear that the result extends to the operators of the form A
including the boundary form since the latter is relatively compact with respect to the
main part, cf. Corollary 3.8 and the reference there, see also [33, Lem. 5.15].
The next theorem establishes continuous diﬀerentiability of the control-to-state
operator S. Given a control u, we use ϕu for the associated solution of the elliptic
equation with u on the right-hand side, cf. (3.18).
Theorem 4.5. Let r > r∗(q) be given. Then the set of global controls Ug forms

continuously invertible. Note that B(¯θ, ¯u) = 0. The term αθl does not depend neither
on u nor on θ and is thus neglected for the rest of this proof. Let us ﬁrst consider the

Accordingly, u (cid:55)→ Ψu(¯θ) = b¯θ(u, u) is continuously diﬀerentiable, and its derivative
in ¯u is given by h (cid:55)→ 2b¯θ(¯u, h). The second component of B is independent of u.
Next, we treat the derivative of B w.r.t. θ. First, note that, due to Assumption 4.2,
the Nemytskii operator θ (cid:55)→ η(θ) is continuously diﬀerentiable from C(Q) to C(Q)
and its derivative in ¯θ is given by h (cid:55)→ η(cid:48)(¯θ)h. With Remark 3.2, we thus ﬁnd that
the derivative of the function θ (cid:55)→ ∂tθ + A(θ)θ as a mapping from W 1,r(J; W
) ∩
Lr(J; W 1,q) to Lr(J; W
h (cid:55)→ ∂th − ∇ · η(¯θ)κ∇h + ˜αh − ∇ · η(cid:48)(¯θ)hκ∇¯θ = ∂th + A(¯θ)h − ∇ · η(cid:48)(¯θ)hκ∇¯θ. (4.5)
We turn to θ (cid:55)→ Ψ¯u(θ). As above, due to Assumption 4.2, θ (cid:55)→ σ(θ) is continuously
diﬀerentiable as a mapping from C(Q) to C(Q) and with derivative h (cid:55)→ σ(cid:48)(¯θ)h (in
a point ¯θ). Further, recall that the derivative of the (continuously diﬀerentiable)
mapping L(X; Y ) (cid:51) A (cid:55)→ A−1 ∈ L(Y ; X) in A is given by H (cid:55)→ −A−1HA−1. The
chain rule and Remark 3.2 thus yield continuous diﬀerentiability of θ (cid:55)→ J (σ(θ)) as a

which implies continuous diﬀerentiability for the latter.
The stated expression for S(cid:48)(u)h is obtained by diﬀerentiating the (constant) function
u (cid:55)→ B(S(u), u). From the second component, we then ﬁnd (S(cid:48)(u)h)(T0) = 0 in

hand side f = −∂uB(S(u), u)h and initial value 0. Inserting all formulas, we obtain
the equation stated in the theorem.
Remark 4.6. One may split the equation solved by ζh = S(cid:48)(u)h in the previous

Theorem 4.5 back into two equations: Introducing

point of view, it makes no diﬀerence working with θ only and considering ϕ as a func-
tion obtained by θ, instead of considering both functions at once.

Combining Theorem 4.5 with Proposition 4.4 as explained above, we obtain the

Now that we have established a certain richness of global controls, we turn to
the question of existence of an optimal control of (P). Following the standard direct
method of the calculus of variations, one soon encounters the problem of lacking
uniform boundedness in a suitable space for solutions θu associated to a minimizing
sequence of global controls u, which is a common obstacle to overcome when treating
quasilinear equations. To circumvent this, we use Proposition 3.3 (i) to show that the

solutions θu are uniformly bounded in W 1,s(J; W

2 ) and s is the exponent from the second addend in the objective function
in (P). As this term in the objective gives an additional bound in Ls(J; W 1,q), we
can employ Corollary 3.20 to “lift” this boundedness result to a H¨older space, which
is suitable for passing to the limit with a minimizing sequence. However, in order to
apply Corollary 3.20, the exponent s has to be suﬃciently large. The precise bound
for s is characterized by the following
Definition 4.8. Let q ∈ (2, min{q0, 3}] be given, where q0 is the number from

On account of ς ≤ 3 < q it follows that ¯r(q, ς) > r∗(q) = 2q

for a given number s > ¯r(q, ς), the previous results, in particular the assertions of
Theorem 3.13, Theorem 4.5, and Corollary 4.13, hold with r = s. The next theorem
precisely elaborates the argument depicted before Deﬁnition 4.8:

As indicated above, the second addend in the objective functional together with

Proof of Theorem 4.9. We show that K is bounded in a suitable maximal-
regularity-like space. To this end, we ﬁrst investigate the right-hand side in the
parabolic equation (3.6). Denote by (θu, ϕu) the solution for a given u ∈ U. Thanks

have solutions ζnk ∈ W 1,s(J; W
lutions, must coincide with θnk . This means, on the one hand, that ζnk = θnk → ¯θ
in C(Q) as k → ∞. On the other hand, [48, Lem. 5.5] also shows that the sequence
(ζnk ) has a limit ¯ζ in the maximal regularity space as k goes to inﬁnity, where ¯ζ is
the solution of the limiting problem

∂tζ + A(¯θ)ζ = Ψ¯u(¯θ) + αθl,

We do, however, already know that ¯ζ = ¯θ, such that ¯θ is the unique global solution
to the nonlinear problem for the limiting control ¯u, i.e., ¯ζ = ¯θ =: θ¯u. Hence, ¯u is still
a global control.

Remark 4.10. Note that we used Proposition 3.3 (i) instead of Lemma 3.7
at the beginning of the proof of Theorem 4.9. This is indeed a crucial point, since
Proposition 3.3 (i) implies the isomorphism property and a uniform bound of the
inverse for all coeﬃcient functions that share the same ellipticity constant and the
same L∞-bound. Thus, in our concrete situation, the norm of (−∇ · σ(θ)ε∇)−1 is
completely determined by Ω ∪ ΓD and the data from Assumption 2.7 (i) and 2.7 (ii),
which gives the estimate in (4.9). By contrast, the application of Lemma 3.7 would
require to control the norm of σ(θ) in C(Ω), see also Theorem 3.23. This however
cannot be guaranteed a priori so that Proposition 3.3 (i) is indeed essential for the
proof of Theorem 4.9. Since the integrability exponent from Proposition 3.3 (i) is
in general less than 3 and therefore less than q, one needs an improved regularity in
time to have the continuous embedding in the desired H¨older space, cf. Corollary 3.20.
Therefore it is not suﬃcient to require s > r∗(q) and the more restrictive condition
s > ¯r(q, ς) is imposed instead.

Next, we incorporate the control- and state constraints in (P) into the control

problem. For this purpose, let us introduce the set

U ad := {u ∈ L2(J; L2(ΓN )) : 0 ≤ u ≤ umax a.e. in ΣN}.

(4.10)
Definition 4.11. We call a global control u ∈ Ug feasible, if u ∈ U ad and the

associated state satisﬁes S(u)(x, t) ≤ θmax(x, t) for all (x, t) ∈ Q.

While the state constraints give upper bounds on the values of feasible solutions,
lower bounds are natural in the problem and implicitly contained in (1.1)–(1.6) in
the sense that the temperature of the workpiece associated with Ω will not drop
below the minima of the surrounding temperature (represented by θl) and the initial
temperature distribution θ0.
Proposition 4.12. For every solution (θ, ϕ) in the sense of Theorem 3.13 with
maximal existence interval Jmax, we have θ(x, t) ≥ minf := min(ess inf Σ θl, minΩ θ0)
for all (x, t) ∈ Ω × [T0, T•], where T• ∈ Jmax.
See Proposition A.1 in the Appendix for a proof. Analogously, we ﬁnd that
u ≡ 0 is a feasible control under Assumption 2.9 (iv), the latter demanding that the
surrounding temperature and the initial temperature do not exceed the state bounds
at any point.

Corollary 4.13. The control u ≡ 0 is a feasible one.

24

H. MEINLSCHMIDT, C. MEYER, J. REHBERG

Proof. By Corollary 4.7, u ≡ 0 is a global control, it obviously satiﬁes the con-
trol constraints, and using the same reasoning as in Proposition A.1 with Assump-
tion 2.9 (iv), we obtain θu≡0 ≤ θmax.

Let us next introduce a modiﬁed control space, ﬁtting the norm in the objective
functional in (P). So far, the controls originated from the space L2s(J; W
) with
s > ¯r(q, ς). For the optimization, we now switch to the more advanced control space

by Assumption 2.9, this space continuously embeds into L2s(J; W

give the boundedness required for Theorem 4.9. Moreover, this embedding is even
compact, as the following result shows:

the objective functional is radially unbounded so that the minimizing sequence is

¯u ∈ Uad. By the compact embedding from Proposition 4.14, (un) converges strongly in
L2s(J; W

and Proposition 4.12 imply that the family (θun ) is uniformly bounded in time and

4.2. Necessary optimality conditions. This section is devoted to the deriva-
tion of necessary optimality conditions for (P) in the form (Pu). To this end, let
us start with the deﬁnition of the Lagrangian function.
It is well-known that the
Lagrangian multipliers associated to the state constraints may, in general, only be
regular Borel measures, see for instance [11]. Hence, we introduce the space M(Q)
as the space of regular Borel measures on Q and, simultaneously, as the dual space of
C(Q).
Definition 4.18. The Lagrangian function L : Ug × M(Q) → R associated

with (Pu) is given by

L(u, µ) = j(u) + (cid:104)µ,SE (u) − θmax(cid:105)M(Q),C(Q),

where j is the reduced objective functional.

Definition 4.19. We denote by ∆q : W 1,q → W

−1,q(cid:48)

the (weak) q-Laplacian,

given by

(cid:104)∆qψ, ξ(cid:105) :=

|∇ψ|q−2∇ψ · ∇ξ dx

The chain rule immediately yields the derivative of L with respect to u:

OPTIMAL CONTROL OF THE THERMISTOR PROBLEM

27

It is well-known that, in general, a so-called regularity condition is needed in
order to ensure the existence of a Lagrangian multiplier. In this case, we rely on the
linearized Slater condition, which is a special form of Robinson’s regularity condition.
Theorem 4.22. Let ¯u be a locally optimal control and let the following so-called
linearized Slater condition be satisﬁed: There exists ˆu ∈ Uad
g such that there is a δ > 0
with the property

SE (¯u)(x, t) + S(cid:48)

E (¯u)(ˆu − ¯u)(x, t) ≤ θmax(x, t) − δ

(4.17)
Then there exists a Lagrangian multiplier ¯µ ∈ M(Q) associated with the state con-
straint in (Pu), i.e., such that (4.14)-(4.16) is satisﬁed.
) as seen in Proposition 4.14, Theorem 4.5 implies
that there is an open ball Bδ(¯u) ⊂ U around ¯u with radius δ > 0 such that Bδ(¯u) ∩
Uad ⊂ Uad

Proof. Since U (cid:44)→ L2s(J; W

for all (x, t) ∈ Q.

min j(u)
s.t. u ∈ Bδ(¯u) ∩ Uad, SE (u)(x, t) ≤ θmax(x, t) ∀(x, t) ∈ Q.

(Paux)

Clearly, ¯u is also a local minimizer of this problem. Moreover, in contrast to Uad
appearing in (Pu), the feasible set Bδ(¯u) ∩ Uad is now convex. Therefore the stan-
dard Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) theory in function space can be applied to (Paux),
see e.g. [55, Thm. 3.1], [11, Thm. 5.2] or [9, Thm. 3.9]. Hence, on account of the
linearized Slater condition in (4.17), there exists a Lagrange multiplier ¯µ ∈ M(Q) so
that (4.14), (4.15), and

g

(cid:104)∂uL(¯u, ¯µ), v − ¯u(cid:105)U ≥ 0 ∀v ∈ Bδ(¯u) ∩ Uad

(4.18)
are fulﬁlled. Now, let u ∈ Uad be arbitrary. Then, due to convexity, ¯u + τ (u − ¯u) ∈
Bδ(¯u) ∩ Uad for τ > 0 suﬃciently small such that this function can be chosen as test
function in (4.18), giving in turn (4.16).

Let us now transform (4.14)-(4.16) into an optimality system involving an adjoint
state. To this end, we aim to reformulate the derivative expression for ∂uL(¯u, µ) from
Lemma 4.20 in a designated locally optimal point ¯u. For brevity, we deﬁne

E (¯u)∗ is associated to the solution operator (in an appropriate sense)
to the adjoint system, which we formally introduce as follows:

Definition 4.23. For given, ﬁxed functions θ and ϕ, given terminal value ϑT

and inhomogeneities f1, f2, g1, g2, we call the following system the adjoint system:

More speciﬁed assumptions about the inhomogeneities f1, f2, g1, g2 and the ter-
minal value ϑT will be given in the following. Note that (4.19) is only a formal
representation of the adjoint of the linearized system of (1.1)-(1.6). We will work
with the abstract version, referring to (3.6) and (3.7) and its linearizations, cf. (4.3)
or Remark 4.6.
Definition 4.24. Let θ ∈ X be ﬁxed and set ϕ = J (σ(θ))u. Further, let f ∈ X(cid:48),
ϑT ∈ X(cid:48)

C(J; Xs) to Xs, such that δT0 ⊗ ϑT and δT1 ⊗ χ are seen as objects from M(J; X(cid:48)

Note that the functionals δT0 × χ and δT1 ⊗ ϑT are well-deﬁned in X(cid:48) due to
X (cid:44)→ C(J; Xs). Of course, the inhomogeneities f1, f2 and g1, g2 from (4.19) are
represented by f = f1 + f2 and g = g1 + g2, respectively. Moreover, thanks to the
symmetry of ε, one easily sees that J (σ(θ))∗ is formally selfadjoint, which is the basis
of the following

Remark 4.25. Similarly to Remark 4.6, we introduce

ψ(ϑ) := J (σ(θ))∗(−2∇ · σ(θ)ϑε∇ϕ + g),

which allows to split (4.20) back into two equations, namely

−∂tϑ + ∂θA(θ)ϑ = (σ(cid:48)(θ)ϑε∇ϕ) · ∇ϕ − (η(cid:48)(θ)κ∇ϑ) · ∇θ − (σ(cid:48)(θ)ε∇ϕ) · ∇ψ

+ δT1 ⊗ ϑT − δT0 ⊗ χ + f,

−∇ · σ(θ)ε∇ψ = −2∇ · σ(θ)ϑε∇ϕ + g,

to be understood as in (4.21). This is exactly a very weak abstract formulation of the
formal adjoint system (4.19) with inhomogeneities f = f1 + f2 and g = g1 + g2 and
terminal value ϑT . Note that the ﬁrst equation is supposed to hold in X(cid:48), the second

using an adjoint-approach (see e.g. [2, Ch. 7]). Since the inhomogeneity f in (4.20)
will in fact contain the Lagrange multiplier µ introduced in Deﬁnition 4.21, we will
not investigate the adjoint system more speciﬁcally under additional regularity as-
sumptions on f , since the Lagrange multipliers are in general only measures and thus
limit said regularity in a crucial way anyhow. In particular, this lack of regularity is
the very obstacle which permits time-derivatives for weak solutions to (4.20), cf. [2,
Prop. 6.1]. Nevertheless, even in the absence of measure-valued Lagrange multipliers,
the time regularity of the adjoint state is still limited by the diﬀerential operator itself,
since (η(cid:48)(θ)κ∇ϑ) · ∇θ is only integrable in time (as opposed to s(cid:48)-integrable).

for given u ∈ Ug:

Corollary 4.27. Let (ϑ, χ) be the solution of (4.21) in the sense of Deﬁni-
tion 4.24 with inhomogeneites f and g and terminal value ϑT . The adjoint linearized
E (u)∗ then assigns to f, g and ϑT in the form f ∈ X(cid:48) as in (4.25)

ΓD

ψ(ϑ) = J (σ(θu))∗(−∇ · σ(θu)ϑε∇ϕu),

Proof. In Theorem 4.5, we found S(cid:48)(u) = −[∂θB(S(u), u)]−1∂uB(S(cid:48)(u), u). Hence,

similarly to Remark 4.25.
with S(cid:48)

E (u) = S(cid:48)(u) ◦ E, we obtain

S(cid:48)
E (u)∗f = −E∗∂uB(SE (u), u)∗∂θB(SE (u), u)−∗f.

In view of Theorem 4.26 and its proof, ∂θB(SE (u), u)−∗f is exactly the unique solution
(ϑ, χ) of (4.21) in the sense of Deﬁnition 4.24 with inhomogeneites f, g and terminal
value ϑT . Moreover, a repetition of the ﬁrst lines of (4.24) shows that

−∂uB(SE (u), u)∗(ϑ, χ) = J (σ(θu))∗(−∇ · σ(θu)ϑε∇ϕu) = ψ(ϑ).

An application of E∗ : L(2s)(cid:48)

(J; W 1,q(cid:48)

Having S(cid:48)

E (u)∗ at hand, we now proceed to establish the actual necessary optimal-
ity conditions by manipulating the variational inequality in the KKT conditions (4.16).
For a concise “strong” formulation in the following theorem, we decompose mea-
sures µ ∈ M(Q) by restriction into µ = µ(T0,T1) + µ{T0}×{T1}, with µ(T0,T1) ∈
M((T0, T1) × Ω) and µ{T0}×{T1} ∈ M(({T0} × {T1}) × Ω). Both measures may in
turn be further decomposed into µ(T0,T1) = µΩ + µΓ, where µΩ ∈ M((T0, T1)× Ω) and
µΓ ∈ M((T0, T1)× Γ), and µ{T0}×{T1} = δT0 ⊗ µT0 + δT1 ⊗ µT with µT0, µT ∈ M(Ω).

Note that the Lagrange multiplier ¯µ is not active on the set {T0} × Ω due to As-
sumption 2.9 (iv) and the positivity and complementary conditions (4.14) and (4.15).
Hence, ¯µT0 is zero and does not contribute to the system of equations in Theorem 4.28.
Note moreover that the variational inequality in (4.26) is just a (semilinear) variational
inequality of obstacle-type in time.

Proof. Let ¯u be a locally optimal control such that the linearized Slater con-
dition (4.17) is satisﬁed. Theorem 4.22 then yields the existence of a Lagrangian
multiplier ¯µ ∈ M(Q) such that (4.14)-(4.16) hold true. We show that these lead to
the assertions.

First consider the linear continuous functional

(cid:104)χE(θ¯u(T1) − θd), Θ(cid:105)L2(Ω) :=

(θ¯u(T1) − θd)Θ dx.

Due to the choice of s, we have Xs (cid:44)→ C(Ω) (cid:44)→ L2(Ω), such that the functional is also
an element of X(cid:48)
Lq ∆qθ¯u
as a functional on X (cid:44)→ Ls(J; W 1,q) via

Lq (cid:104)∆qθ¯u(t), ξ(t)(cid:105)W 1,q dt.
The inclusion X (cid:44)→ C(Q) also implies ¯µ ∈ M(Q) (cid:44)→ X(cid:48). Hence, inserting θ(cid:48)

5. Application and numerical example. As already outlined in [39] and the
introduction, a typical example of an application for a problem in the form (P) is
the optimal heating of a conducting material such as steel by means of an electric
current. The aim of such procedures is to heat up a workpiece by electric current
and to cool it down rapidly with water nozzles in order to harden it. In case of steel,
this treatment indeed produces a hard martensitic outer layer, see for instance [10,
Ch. 9.18] for a phase diagram and [10, Chapters 10.5/10.7 about Martensite], and
is thus used for instance for rack-and-pinion actuators, to be found e.g. in steering
mechanisms. The part of the workpiece to be heated up corresponds to the design area
E in the objective functional in (P). In order to avoid thermal stresses in the material,
it is crucial to produce a homogeneous temperature distribution in the design area,
which is reﬂected by the ﬁrst term of the objective functional. The gradient term
in the objective functional further enforces minimal thermal stresses. Moreover, the
temperatures necesssary for the hardening process as described above are rather close
to the melting point of the material, thus the state constraints are used to prevent the
temperature exceeding the melting temperature θmax. The control constraints in (P)
represent a maximum electrical current which can be induced in the workpiece.

In the following we exhibit numerical examples for the optimal control of the
three-dimensional thermistor problem in the form (P), underlining in particular the
importance of the state-constraints. The considered computational domain Ω is a
(simpliﬁed) three-dimensional gear-rack as seen in Figure 5.1, where the design area
E consists of the sawteeth. The mesh consists of about 80000 nodes, inducing 400000
cells with cell diameteres ranging from 8.8 · 10−4 to 7.6 · 10−3.

(b) Ω from above (x1x3-plane) with ΓN (left) and ΓD (right) emphasized.

Fig. 5.1: The computational domain Ω used in the numerical example.

The heat-equation we use in the computations is as follows:
Cp∂tθ − div(η(θ)κ∇θ) = (σ(θ)∇ϕ) · ∇ϕ.

It deviates from (1.1) by the factor Cp, the so-called the volumetric heat capacity,
where  is the density of the material and Cp is its speciﬁc heat capacity. How-
ever, since we assume Cp to be constant, it certainly has no inﬂuence on the theory
presented above.
In [33, Remarks 6.13/15] and [37] it is laid out how to modify
the analysis if one wants to incorporate a volumetric heat capacity depending on
the temperature θ. For a realistic modeling of the process, we use the data gath-
ered in [16], i.e., the workpiece Ω is supposedly made of non-ferromagnetic stainless
steel (#1.4301). The constants used can be found in Table 5.1 and the conductivity
functions are given by

σ(θ) :=

with the constants aσ = 4.9659 · 10−7, bσ = 8.4121 · 10−10, cσ = −3.7246 · 10−13 and
dσ = 6.1960 · 10−17 for the electrical conductivity (in Ω−1m−1), and

η(θ) := 100(aη + bηθ)

for

θ ∈ [0, 10000] K

with aη = 0.11215 and bη = 1.4087·10−4 for the thermal conductivity (in Wm−1K−1).
Both functions are extended outside of [0, 10000] in a smooth and bounded way,
such that Assumptions 2.7 and 4.2 are satisﬁed. Note that ε and κ are each chosen
as the identity matrix, as we do not account for heterogeneous materials in this
numerical example. To counter-act on the diﬀerent scales inherent in the problem,
cf. the value for umax and θ0 in Table 5.1, the model was nondimensionalized for the
implementation.

The optimization problem (P) is solved by means of a Nonlinear Conjugate-
Gradients Method in the form as described in [17], modiﬁed to a projected method
to account for the admissible set Uad. The method needed up to 150 iterations to

34

H. MEINLSCHMIDT, C. MEYER, J. REHBERG

meet the stopping criterion, which required the relative change in the objective func-
tional to be smaller than 10−5. The state constraints in (P) are incorporated by a
quadratic penalty approach—so-called Moreau-Yosida regularization—, cf. [38] and
the references therein, where the penalty-parameter was increased up to a maximum
of 1010, stopping earlier if the violation of the state constraints was smaller than
10−2 K. This resulted in a violation of 9.54 · 10−2 K, which is about 0.0056% of the
upper bound of 1700 K. In each step of the optimization algorithm, the nonlinear
state equations (1.1)-(1.6) and the adjoint equations (4.19) have to be solved. We
use an Implicit Euler Scheme for the time-discretization of these equations, whereas
the spatial discretization is done via piecewise continuous linear ﬁnite elements. The
nonlinear system of equations arising in each time-step is solved via Newton’s method.
Here, we do a semi-implicit pre-step to obtain a suitable initial guess for the discrete
ϕ for Newton’s method. For the control, we also choose piecewise continuous linear
functions in space where the values in the ﬁrst and last timestep were pre-set to 0.
In the calculation of the gradient of the reduced objective functional j, the gradient

order central diﬀerence quotient uk+1−2uk−uk−1
ttu)(tk) at time step
k with the appropriate modiﬁcations for the ﬁrst and last time step, respectively. All
computations were performed within the FEnICS framework [22].
For the experiment duration, we set T1 − T0 = 2.0 s with timesteps ∆t = 0.02 s
and T0 = 0.0 s, while we use γ = 10−8 and β = 10−5 – this small value for β is only
possible due to the nondimensionalization performed. In the following, we elaborate
on two settings: one in which we enforce the state constraint θ ≤ θmax and one in
which we do not.

Fig. 5.2: Detail of the sawteeth in E at end time t = 2.0 s with distribution of the
temperature θ in K.

Figure 5.2 shows the temperature distribution at end time T1 = 2.0 s in E in
both cases. The desired temperature distribution close to uniformly 1500 K has been
nearly achieved in the free optimization, see Figure 5.2a, at the price of very high
temperature values around ΓD and ΓN already early in the heating process. We come
back to this below, cf. also Figure 5.6. For the state-constrained optimization, we
achieve a much worse result (note the same scales in both Figure 5.2a and 5.2b), which
again corresponds to the rapid evolution to high temperatures at the critical areas,

OPTIMAL CONTROL OF THE THERMISTOR PROBLEM

35

since these crucially limit the maximal amount of energy induced into the workpiece
if one wants to prevent the temperature rising higher than the given bounds θmax.
This can also be seen in the development of the optimal controls in both cases over
time, see below.

Fig. 5.3: The potential ϕ (in V) associated with the optimal solution at time t = 1.0 s,
view from the side (x1x2-plane).

Fig. 5.4: Magnitude of the gradient ∇ϕ (in V/m) associated with the optimal solution
at time t = 1.0 s, view from the side (x1x2-plane).

The potential ϕ and its gradient ∇ϕ associated with the optimal control to the
state-constrained optimization problem, at time t = 1.0 s are depicted in Figures 5.3
and 5.4. Here, ∇ϕ is to be understood as the projection of the potentially discon-
tinuous gradient of ϕ to the space of continuous linear ﬁnite elements. The potential
ϕ decreases from ΓN to the grounding with prescribed value ϕ ≡ 0 at ΓD, cf. Fig-
ure 5.1b, thus inducing a current ﬂow and acting as a heat source between ΓD and
ΓN , since the corresponding term in the heat equation σ(θ)ε∇ϕ · ∇ϕ is proportional
to |∇ϕ|2 due to the coercivity and boundedness of ε and the bounds on σ. This is
conﬁrmed by the magnitude of ∇ϕ as seen in Figure 5.4. In particular one observes
that ∇ϕ is very small or 0 in E, which means that the current ﬂows only through the
area between ΓD and ΓN and right below E, heating only this part of the workpiece.

The optimal controls are shown in Figure 5.5, taken at an arbitrary but ﬁxed grid
point in ΓN . The high values in the control at the beginning of the process seem to
be the result of the inability to heat up the tooth rack in the design-area E directly as
explained above, which makes heating of the teeth reliant on diﬀusion. This in turn
requires the needed total energy to be inserted into the system as fast as possible,
resulting in high control values, which also agrees with the requirement to obtain
a uniform temperature distribution in the tooth rack. These considerations also
underline the necessity of control bounds in this example. In decreasing the control
values after the inital period, the opimization procedure in the free optimization is
avoiding to “over-shoot”, i.e., to produce a higher temperature than desired. In the
case of state-constrained optimization, the presence of the state constraints forces
an earlier decrease in control values in order to not violate the upper bound θmax,
which is then compensated by a slightly higher level of values towards the end of the
simulation. This, however, is clearly not enough to make up for the earlier decrease
as seen in Figure 5.2.

point close to ΓN .

(b) Temperature θ in K at the critical
area near ΓN at time t = 1.4 s.

Fig. 5.6: Inﬂuence and necessity of state constraints.

Figure 5.6 illustrates why state constraints are a necessary addition to an appro-
priate model of the industrial steel heating process. Figure 5.6a shows the temperature
evolution in a point in one of the two critical regions, which are the points near ΓD
and ΓN , see also Figure 5.6b and the magnitude of ∇ϕ at this region in Figure 5.4. In
this case, the point lies in E close to ΓN , but we emphasize that the state constraints
hold in the whole Ω and are not limited to E. The upper line in Figure 5.6a cor-
responds to the temperature associated to the optimal solution of the unconstrained
optimization, while the lower belongs to the state-constrained optimal solution, with
the upper bound θmax = 1700 K marked by the dashed line. In the free optimization
case, the temperature exceeds the bounds already at about one third of the simula-
tion time and continuous to rise to almost 1000 K above θmax. On the other hand,
the temperature obtained from the state-constrained case stays below the threshold,
as required. Note here that the evaluated point is chosen as one of those where the
temperature rises highest overall, compare the temperature distribution as seen in
Figure 5.6b and the maximal temperature achieved in the free optimization case in
Figure 5.6a.

Concluding from the results presented above, it becomes apparent that the pre-

OPTIMAL CONTROL OF THE THERMISTOR PROBLEM

37

scribed time of 2.0 s is too short to heat up the workpiece in the given geometry
enough to reach the required temperature for Austenite to form in the workpiece
(cf. [10, Ch. 9.18]) in E, if melting is to be prevented.

Appendix A. A “minimum principle”.
Proposition A.1. For every solution (θ, ϕ) in the sense of Theorem 3.13 with
maximal existence interval Jmax, it is true that θ(x, t) ≥ min(ess inf Σ θl, minΩ θ0) for
all (x, t) ∈ Ω × [T0, T•], where T• ∈ Jmax.
Proof. We set minf := min(ess inf Σ θl, minΩ θ0) and ζ(t) = θ(t) − minf and de-
compose ζ(t) into its positive and negative part, that is, ζ(t) = ζ +(t) − ζ−(t) with
both ζ +(t) and ζ−(t) being positive functions. By [18, Ch. IV, §7, Prop. 6/Rem. 12]
we then have that ζ−(t) is still an element of W 1,q for almost every t ∈ (T0, T•). In
particular, we may test (3.6) against −ζ−(t), insert θ = ζ + minf and use that minf is
constant:

Observe that the support of products of ζ(t) and ζ−(t) is exactly the support of ζ−(t),

(A.1)
Let us show that ∂t(cid:107)ζ−(t)(cid:107)2
L2 ≤ 0. By Assumption 2.7, (η(θ(t))κ∇ζ−(t)) · ∇ζ−(t) ≥
ηκ(cid:107)∇ζ−(t)(cid:107)2R3 and −(σ(θ(t))ε∇ϕ(t))·∇ϕ(t) ≤ −σε(cid:107)∇ϕ(t)(cid:107)2R3. This means that both
integrals on the left-hand side in (A.1) are positive (since α ≥ 0), while the second
term on the right-hand side is negative. The constant minf is constructed exactly
such that θl(t) − minf
is greater or equal than zero almost everywhere, such that
−α(θl(t) − minf )ζ−(t) ≤ 0. Hence, from (A.1) it follows that ∂t(cid:107)ζ−(t)(cid:107)2
L2 ≤ 0. But,
due to the construction of ζ, we have ζ(T0) ≥ 0, which means that ζ−(T0) ≡ 0 and
thus ζ−(t) ≡ 0 for all t ∈ (T0, T•).
