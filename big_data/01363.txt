Abstract. In this paper we study some basic properties of rough I-convergent
double sequences in the line of D¨undar [8]. We also study the set of all
rough I-limits of a double sequence and relation between boundedness and
rough I-convergence of a double sequence.

Key words and phrases : Double sequence, ideal, rough I-convergence, rough

I-limit.

1. Introduction:

The concept of I-convergence of double sequences was introduced by Bal-
cerzak et. al.
[2]. The notion of I-convergence of a double sequence, which is
based on the structure of the ideal I of subsets of N × N, where N is the set of
all natural numbers, is a natural generalization of the notion of convergence of
a double sequence in Pringsheim’s sense [17] as well as the notion of statistical
convergence of a double sequence [14].

A lot of work on I-convergence of double sequences can be found in ([3], [4],

[5], [7] etc.) and many others.

The concept of rough I-convergence of single sequences was introduced by Pal
et. al. [15] which is a generalization of the earlier concepts namely rough con-
vergence [16] and rough statistical convergence [1] of single sequences. Recently
rough statistical convergence of double sequences has been introduced by Ma-
lik and Maity [13] as a generalization of rough convergence of double sequences
[12] and investigated some basic properties of this type of convergence and also
studied relation between the set of statistical cluster points and the set of rough
limit points of a double sequence. Recently the notion of rough I-convergence

for double sequences has been introduced by D¨undar [8]. In this paper we inves-
tigate some basic properties of rough I-convergence of double sequences in ﬁnite
dimensional normed linear spaces which are not done earlier. We study the set of
rough I-limits of a double sequence and also the relation between boundedness
and rough I-convergence of a double sequence.

2. Basic Deﬁnitions and Notations

Throughout the paper N denotes the set of all positive integers and R denotes

the set of all real numbers.

Deﬁnition 2.1 (12). Let x = {xjk}j,k ∈N be a double sequence in a normed
linear space(X, k . k) and r be a non-negative real number. x is said to be
r-convergent to ξ ∈ X, denoted by x r→ ξ, if for any ǫ > 0 there exists Nǫ ∈ N
such that for all j, k ≥ Nǫ we have

k xjk − ξ k < r + ǫ.

In this case ξ is called an r-limit of x.
It is clear that rough limit of x is not necessarily unique (for r > 0). So we
x =
x 6= ∅ and r is called a

consider r-limit set of x which is denoted by LIM r
{ξ ∈ X : x r→ ξ}. x is said to be r-convergent if LIM r
rough convergence degree of x.

x and is deﬁned by LIM r

We recall that a subset K of N × N is said to have natural density d(K) if

where K(n, m) = |{(j, k) ∈ N × N : j ≤ n, k ≤ m}|.

d(K) = lim

m→∞
n→∞

K(n,m)
n.m ,

Deﬁnition 2.2 (13). Let x = {xjk}j,k∈N be a double sequence in a normed
linear space (X, k . k) and r be a non negative real number. x is said to be
r- statistically convergent to ξ, denoted by x r−st2−→ ξ, if for any ε > 0 we have
d(A(ε)) = 0, where A(ε) = {(j, k) ∈ N × N :k xjk − ξ k≥ r + ε}. In this case ξ
is called r-statistical limit of x.

Clearly for r = 0 from Deﬁnition 2.1 we get Pringsheim convergence of double
sequences and from Deﬁnition 2.2 we get ordinary statistical convergence of
double sequences.

Deﬁnition 2.3. A class I of subsets of a nonempty set X is said to be an ideal
in X provided

(i) φ ∈ I.

(ii) A, B ∈ I implies AS B ∈ I.

(iii) A ∈ I, B ⊂ A implies B ∈ I.
I is called a nontrivial ideal if X /∈ I.

Deﬁnition 2.4. A non empty class F of subsets of a nonempty set X is said to
be a ﬁlter in X provided

(i) φ /∈ F .

(ii) A, B ∈ F implies AT B ∈ F .

(iii) A ∈ F, A ⊂ B implies B ∈ F .
If I is a nontrivial ideal in X, X 6= φ, then the class

F (I) = {M ⊂ X : M = X \ A for some A ∈ I}

is a ﬁlter on X, called the ﬁlter associated with I.

Deﬁnition 2.5 (4). A nontrivial ideal I in X is called admissible if {x} ∈ I for
each x ∈ X.

Deﬁnition 2.6 (4). A nontrivial ideal I on N × N is called strongly admissible
if {i} × N and N × {i} belong to I for each i ∈ N.

Clearly every strongly admissible ideal is admissible. Throughout the paper

we take I as a strongly admissible ideal in N × N.

Deﬁnition 2.7 (8). Let x = {xjk}j,k∈N be a double sequence in a normed linear
space (X, k . k) and r be a non negative real number. Then x is said to be rough
ideal convergent or rI-convergent to ξ, denoted by x rI−→ ξ, if for any ε > 0 we
have {(j, k) ∈ N × N :k xjk − ξ k≥ r + ε} ∈ I. In this case ξ is called rI-limit of
x and x is called rough I-convergent to ξ with r as roughness degree.

Throughout this paper x denotes the double sequence {xjk}j,k∈N in a normed

linear space(X, k . k) and r denotes a non negative real number.

For r = 0 we get the usual I-convergence of double sequences. But our main
interest is on the case where r > 0. Because it may happen that a double
sequence x = {xjk}j,k∈N is not I-convergent in usual sense but there exists
a double sequence y = {yjk}j,k∈N which is I-convergent in usual sense and
k xjk − yjk k≤ r for all (j, k) ∈ N × N (or {(j, k) ∈ N × N : k xjk − yjk k> r} ∈ I)
for some r > 0. Then x is rI-convergent.

From the deﬁnition it is clear that rI-limit of x is not necessarily unique (for
x = {ξ ∈
x 6= ∅ and r is called a

r > 0). So we consider rI-limit set of x, which is denoted by I − LIM r
X : x rI−→ ξ}. x is said to be rI-convergent if I − LIM r
rough I-convergence degree of x.

Deﬁnition 2.8. A double sequence x in X is said to be bounded if there exists
a positive real number M such that k xjk k< M for all (j, k) ∈ N × N.

Deﬁnition 2.9. A double sequence x in X is said to be I-bounded if there
exists a positive real number M such that {(j, k) ∈ N × N :k xjk k≥ M } ∈ I.

Deﬁnition 2.10 (5). A point ξ ∈ X is said to be an I-cluster point of a double
sequence x = {xjk}j,k∈N if and only if for each ε > 0 the set {(j, k) ∈ N × N :k
xjk − ξ k< ε} /∈ I. We denote the set of all I-cluster points of x by I(Γx).

Theorem 2.1 (5). An I-bounded double sequence x = {xjk}j,k∈N of real num-
bers is I-convergent if and only if I − lim sup x = I − lim inf x.

Theorem 2.2 (5). Let x = {xjk}j,k∈N be a bounded double sequence of real
numbers, then

(i) I − lim sup x = max I(Γx),
(ii) I − lim inf x = min I(Γx).

The above result is also true for I-bounded double sequences. So it can be

stated as follows.

Theorem 2.3. Let x = {xjk}j,k∈N be an I-bounded double sequence of real
numbers, then

(i) I − lim sup x = max I(Γx),
(ii) I − lim inf x = min I(Γx).

Theorem 2.4 (8). For a double sequence x = {xjk}j,k∈N in a normed linear
x) ≤ 2r. In particular if x I−→ ξ, then
space (X, k . k) we have diam(I − LIM r
I − LIM r

x = Br(ξ) = {y ∈ X :k y − ξ k≤ r} and so diam(I − LIM r

x) = 2r.

Note 2.1. When r=0, then diam (I − LIM r
x is
either φ or singleton. This implies the uniqueness of limit of I-convergent double
sequence.

x) = 0. Therefore I − LIM r

Theorem 2.5 (8). Let x = {xjk}j,k∈N be a double sequence in X and c ∈ I(Γx).
Then k ξ − c k≤ r for all ξ ∈ I − LIM r

x i.e. I − LIM r

x ⊂ Br(c).

We now consider an example of a double sequence which is rough I-convergent

but not rough convergent.

Example 2.1. We consider the ideal Id = {A ⊂ N × N : d(A) = 0}. Let
x = {xjk}j,k∈N be a double sequence in the normed linear space (R, k . k) deﬁned
by

xjk = 2jk , if j and k are squares,

= (−1)j+k, otherwise.

Then

Id − LIM r

x = (cid:26) ∅

[1 − r, r − 1]

;
;

if r < 1
if r ≥ 1

and LIM r

x = ∅ for all r ≥ 0.

From the above example we see that I −LIM r

x 6= ∅ does not imply LIM r

x 6= ∅.

But LIM r

x 6= ∅ always implies that I − LIM r

x 6= ∅.

3. Main Results

We ﬁrst establish a relation between boundedness and rough I-convergence

of double sequences.

Theorem 3.1. If a double sequence x = {xjk} is bounded, then there exists
r ≥ 0 such that I − LIM r

x 6= φ.

Proof. The proof is similar to the proof of Theorem 3.2 [13], so is omitted. (cid:3)

Note 3.1. Taking I = {A ∈ N × N : d (A) = 0}, from Note 3.2 [13] we see that
the converse of Theorem 3.1 is not true.

We now show that the converse of Theorem 3.1 is true if the double sequence

x is I-bounded.

Theorem 3.2. A double sequence x is I-bounded if and only if there exists r ≥ 0
such that I − LIM r

x 6= ∅.

Proof. Let x be an I-bounded double sequence. Then there exists a positive
real number M such that A = {(j, k) ∈ N × N :k xjk k≥ M } ∈ I. Let
x 6= ∅.
r

= sup{k xjk k: (j, k) ∈ N× N\A}. Then 0 ∈ I −LIM r

x and so I −LIM r

Conversely, let I − LIM r

x. Take ε = 1.
Then B = {(j, k) ∈ N × N :k xjk − ξ k≥ 1 + r} ∈ I. Now {(j, k) ∈ N × N :k
xjk k≥ 1 + r+ k ξ k} ⊂ B and so {(j, k) ∈ N × N :k xjk k≥ 1 + r+ k ξ k} ∈ I.
This shows that x is I-bounded.
(cid:3)

x 6= ∅ for some r ≥ 0. Let ξ ∈ I − LIM r

Next we present an alternative proof of Theorem 2.4 [8] which gives a topo-

logical property of the rI-limit set of a double sequence..

Theorem 3.3. For all r ≥ 0, the rI-limit set I − LIM r
x = {xjk}j,k∈N is closed.

Theorem 3.4. Let x = {xjk}j,k∈N be a double sequence in X. Then x is I-
convergent to ξ if and only if I − LIM r

x = Br(ξ).

Proof. It directly follows from Theorem 2.4 that if x is I-convergent to ξ, then
I − LIM r

x = Br(ξ).

Conversely, let I − LIM r

x = Br(ξ). We have to show that x is I-convergent
to ξ, i.e. for all a > 0, A(a) = {(j, k) ∈ N × N :k xjk − ξ k≥ a} ∈ I. Now ﬁxed

a > 0. Let us choose r > 0 and ε > 0 such that r + ε < a. For ξ ∈ I − LIM r
x,
{(j, k) ∈ N × N :k xjk − ξ k≥ r + ε} ∈ I. Since {(j, k) ∈ N × N :k xjk − ξ k≥
a} ⊂ {(j, k) ∈ N × N :k xjk − ξ k≥ r + ε}. So {(j, k)N × N :k xjk − ξ k≥ a} ∈ I.
Hence x is I-convergent to ξ.
(cid:3)

Theorem 3.5. Let (R, k . k) be a strictly convex space and x = {xjk}j,k∈N be
double sequence in R. For any r > 0, let y1, y2 ∈ I − LIM r
x with k y1 − y2 k= 2r.
Then x is I-convergent to 1

2 (y1 + y2).

Proof. Let y3 be an arbitrary I-cluster point of x. Now since y1, y2 ∈ I − LIM r
x,
so by Theorem 2.5 we have

k y1 − y3 k≤ r and k y2 − y3 k≤ r.

Then 2r =k y1 − y2 k≤k y1 − y3 k + k y3 − y2 k≤ 2r. Therefore k y1 − y3 k=k
y2 − y3 k= r. Now

(y1 − y2) =

[(y3 − y1) + (y2 − y3)].

Since k y1−y2 k= 2r, so 1
2 k y2−y1 k= r. Again since the space is strictly convex,
so by (1) we get 1
2 (y2 − y1) = y3 − y1 = y2 − y3. Thus y3 is the unique I-cluster
point of the double sequence x. Again by the given condition I − LIM r
x 6= ∅,
so by Theorem 3.2 x is I-bounded. Since y3 is the unique I-cluster point of
the I-bounded double sequence x, so by Theorem 2.1 and Theorem 2.3 x is
I-convergent to y3 = 1
