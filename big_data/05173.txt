Abstract

In this work the supersymmetric technique is applied to the truncated oscillator to generate Hamiltonians
ruled by second and third-order polynomial Heisenberg algebras, which are connected to the Painlev´e IV
and Painlev´e V equations respectively. The aforementioned connection is exploited to produce particular
solutions to both non-linear diﬀerential equations and the B¨acklund transformations relating them.

Introduction

Supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSY QM) is a technique typically used to modify the energy spectrum
of a given initial Hamiltonian H0 [1–29], yielding new SUSY partners whose spectra are similar to the initial
one. Moreover, if the system of departure is ruled by certain algebraic structure, then its SUSY partners turn
out to be described by polynomial deformations of such an algebra.

In a recent paper, the SUSY transformations of ﬁrst and second-order were applied to the harmonic oscillator
with an inﬁnite potential barrier at the origin [28], which we will call truncated oscillator. The underlying alge-
braic structure for the SUSY partners of the truncated oscillator was as well analyzed, becoming a deformation
of the Heisenberg-Weyl algebra known as polynomial Heisenberg algebra [18, 30–32].

It is important to note that general systems ruled by second- and third-order polynomial Heisenberg alge-
bras, described by one-dimensional Schr¨odinger Hamiltonians having third and fourth-order diﬀerential ladder
operators, are linked to the Painlev´e IV and V equations respectively [30,33–43]. This connection was exploited
in [28] to generate solutions to the Painlev´e IV equation, using the SUSY partner Hamiltonians for the truncated
oscillator, where it was used that the initial system is ruled by the Heisenberg-Weyl algebra.

Since the truncated oscillator is also characterized by a ﬁrst-order polynomial Heisenberg algebra, which
second-order generators act on the energy eigenstates more naturally than those of the Heisenberg-Weyl alge-
bra, thus there are SUSY partner Hamiltonians having as well fourth-order diﬀerential ladder operators and,
consequently, being linked with the Painlev´e V equation. Here we continue the work done in [28] in the afore-
mentioned natural direction. First we revisit the SUSY partners of the truncated oscillator, considering now that
they are ruled by both, second and third-order polynomial Heisenberg algebras. Moreover, the corresponding
solutions to the Painlev´e IV and V equations will be studied, along with the B¨acklund transformations which
will clarify the way in which these solutions are related among each other.

With such a goal in mind, the article has been organized as follows. In Section 2 the supersymmetric partners
of the truncated oscillator are obtained using ﬁrst- and second-order transformations. The connection between
these SUSY partners and PIV and PV equations is described in Sections 3 and 4, respectively, along with a
straightforward procedure to obtain solutions to these non-linear equations. The Backl¨und transformations
relating these Painlev´e transcendents are found in Section 5. The conclusions and ﬁnal remarks of the research
can be found in Section 6.

2 Supersymmetric partners of the truncated oscillator

As was stated in the introduction, the system on which the whole procedure will be developed is the truncated
oscillator, described by the Hamiltonian H0 = − 1

d2
dx2 + V0(x) with

2

V0(x) =(cid:26) x2
∞

2

if x > 0
if x ≤ 0.

The eigenvalues of H0 take the form En = 2n + 3

2 with n ∈ N and the corresponding eigenfunctions are

ψn(x) ∝ x e−x2/2

1F1(cid:18) − n;

3
2

; x2(cid:19).

H0 can be seen as the harmonic oscillator in the reduced domain (0,∞) and a null boundary condition at the
origin, i.e., ψn = 0 for x = 0. Thus the eigenfunctions of H0 are proportional to the odd eigenfunctions of the
harmonic oscillator. There are also formal even eigenfunctions associated to En = 2n + 1

2 , n ∈ N given by

χn(x) ∝ e−x2/2

1F1(cid:18) − n;

1
2

; x2(cid:19),

(1)

which, however, do not satisfy the boundary condition at x = 0.

2.1 First-order SUSY

In order to implement the ﬁrst-order supersymmetric transformation (1-SUSY) one needs to deﬁne the inter-
twining operator

A+ =

1

√2(cid:18)−

d
dx

+ α(x)(cid:19) ,

which diﬀerential order (one) deﬁnes precisely the order of the SUSY transformation. Along with A+, a second
Hamiltonian H1 = − 1

d2
dx2 + V1(x) is introduced, which is required to fulﬁll the intertwining relation

2

H1A+ = A+H0.

H1 and H0 will be called supersymmetric partners. Such an intertwining yields an immediate relation between
the solutions of the stationary Schr¨odinger equation H1φn(x) = Enφn(x) and those of H0ψn(x) = Enψn(x),
namely,

φn(x) = CnA+ψn(x),

where Cn is a normalization constant.

For realizing the intertwining relation one needs only a seed solution u(x) (or transformation function) which,

in general, is a solution of H0u(x) = ǫu(x) disregarding the boundary conditions and such that

A+ =

1

√2(cid:20)−

d
dx

+ [ln(u)]′(cid:21) ,

V1 = V0 − [ln(u)]′′ ,

where ǫ is the factorization energy. Hereafter, if f is a function of x then f′ = df
understood as common notation.
The most general form of u is

dx , f′′ = d2f

dx2 , . . . shall be

(2)

which is a linear combination of an even and an odd seed solution. Since one wishes to maintain control on the
singularities appearing in the procedure, which are mainly a result of the terms proportional to ln(u) and its
derivatives, hereafter only transformation functions with deﬁnite parity will be used.

In [28] it was found that for both choices of parity of u(x) the ﬁrst-order SUSY partner Hamiltonians H1

and H0 are isospectral, up to a shift in the ground state energy.

2.2 Second-order SUSY

If instead of the ﬁrst-order operator A+ one uses a second-order one, generally described as

B+ =

1

2(cid:18) d2
dx2 − η

d
dx

+ γ(cid:19) ,

then one will implement a second-order supersymmetric transformation (2-SUSY). This time the intertwining
relation takes the form

H2B+ = B+H0,

and the relation between solutions of H2φn(x) = Enφn(x) and those of H0ψn(x) = Enψn(x) is now

φn(x) = DnB+ψn(x),

where Dn is a normalization constant.

This second-order SUSY transformation is ﬁxed now by two seed solutions of H0ui = ǫiui, i = 1, 2, for which
without lost of generality ǫ2 < ǫ1 is taken. The intertwining operator and the potential for the new Hamiltonian
H2 are given by

B+ =

1

2( d2
dx2 − [ln W (u1, u2)]′ d

dx

V2 = V0 − [ln W (u1, u2)]′′ ,

+

2(cid:16)[ln W (u1, u2)]′′ + [ln W (u1, u2)]′2(cid:17) − 2V + ǫ1 + ǫ2),

where W (f, g) is the Wronskian of the two functions f , g.

The general form of the transformation functions u1 and u2 is a linear combination of xe−x2/2

and e−x2/2
with deﬁnite parity, for reasons previously stated. Indeed, four parity combinations for the pair u1(x), u2(x)
are at hand [28]:

2 , x2(cid:17)
2 , x2(cid:17) (see Eq. (2)); however, this study will be focused on transformation functions

as long as ǫ2 < ǫ1 ≤ 3

2. When u1(x) is odd and u2(x) is even no singularities will be added to H2 in (0,∞) if Ej = 1+4j

2 ≤ ǫ2 <

ǫ1 ≤ 3+4j

2 = Ej.

3. If u1(x) is chosen even and u2(x) odd, there will be no singularities other than the one at x = 0 in the

domain of V2 as long as ǫ2 < ǫ1 ≤ 1

2 = E0 or Ej = 3+4j

2 ≤ ǫ2 < ǫ1 ≤ 5+4j

2 = Ej+1.

4. When both u1(x) and u2(x) are taken to be even no new singularities are added to the new potential for

x > 0 if ǫ2 < ǫ1 ≤ 1

2 = E0 or Ej = 1+4j

2 ≤ ǫ2 < ǫ1 ≤ 1+4(j+1)

2

= Ej+1.

Using the second-order SUSY transformation, levels can be added or erased in the energy spectrum of
H2 for particular choices of ǫ1 and ǫ2 but, in general, for the ﬁrst three previous cases it turns out that the
eigenfunctions of the initial Hamiltonian transform into eigenfunctions of the new Hamiltonian H2. On the
other hand, for the last choice of parity combination, the eigenfunctions of the initial Hamiltonian transform
into non-physical solutions of the Schr¨odinger equation of H2 and the non-physical solutions of the Schr¨odinger
equation of H0 associated to En of Eq. (1) transform into the eigenfunctions of H2.

3 Painlev´e IV equation

Now consider the set of operators {H, L+, L−} satisfying the following commutators

[H, L±] = ±L±,
[L−, L+] = Pm(H),

3

where Pm(H) is a polynomial of degree m in the Hamiltonian H (of Schr¨odinger form) and L± are (m + 1)th-
order diﬀerential operators. Such algebraic structures are known as Polynomial Heisenberg Algebra (PHA) of
order m, which can be recognized as deformations of the algebra of the harmonic oscillator.

In particular, if the ladder operators L± are of third-order, then m = 2 and the PHA is of second-order.
2 =

Thus, by factorizing L+ = L+

2 + xg + ε1 − 1
2 ,

This last equation for the function g(x) is recognized as the Painlev´e IV (PIV) equation with parameters
a = ε2 + ε3 − 2ε1 − 1, b = −2(ε2 − ε3)2. In the standard approach one would solve the PIV equation in order to
realize a second-order PHA; however, it is possible to use a known realization of the second-order PHA, through
supersymmetric partners of the truncated oscillator, to obtain several solutions to this non-linear diﬀerential
equation.

A straightforward method to obtain such solutions is to analyze the operator product L+L−,

L+L− = (H − ε1) (H − ε2) (H − ε3) ,

which indicates that there are three extremal states φε1 , φε2 and φε3 , with corresponding eigenvalues ε1, ε2 and
ε3 respectively which are simultaneously annihilated by L−.
One of these extremal states, say φ, satisﬁes the equation

L−1 φ =

1

√2(cid:20) d

dx

+ f (x)(cid:21) φ = 0,

where f (x) = x + g(x). This can be solved for g(x) as

g(x) = −x − [ln φ]′,

which is a solution to the PIV equation with parameters a = ε2 + ε3 − 2ε1 − 1, b = −2(ε2 − ε3)2. One can
use any extremal state as φ to calculate g(x), thus there are three solutions gi(x) = −x − [ln φεi ]′, i = 1, 2, 3
corresponding to the three diﬀerent choices of φ.
If H = H1 one can deﬁne natural ladder operators L± = A+a±A, where a± are the usual ﬁrst-order ladder
operators of the harmonic oscillator. Therefore, L± are diﬀerential operators of third-order and {H, L+, L−}
realize a second-order PHA. Note, however, that operators L± move, in general, a solution of the Schr¨odinger
equation from a physical state En to a non-physical solution associated to En and vice versa.
We conclude that a family of realizations of second-order PHA’s were found through ﬁrst-order supersym-
metric transformations on the truncated oscillator and thus several solutions of the PIV equation can be found
departing from the following extremal states of L−

φε1 ∝

φε2 ∝ A+a+u,

with corresponding (formal) eigenvalues ǫ, ǫ + 1, 1
2 .

When u(x) is odd the ﬁrst identiﬁcation of extremal states gives a solution to the PIV equation of the form

of g1(x):

2 , b1 = −2(cid:0)ǫ + 1

The solutions obtained through the other two permutations of the extremal states can be written in terms

The parameters of the PIV equation are now a2 = −ǫ − 5
respectively.

, and a3 = 2ǫ − 1, b3 = −2
On the other hand, for H = H2 one can deﬁne natural ladder operators L± = B+a±B which are of ﬁfth-
order; thus, one needs to use the reduction theorem described in [24] which asserts that when u2(x) = a−u1(x),
and ǫ2 = ǫ1 − 1, the Hamiltonian H2 has a set of third-order ladder operators l± such that

2 , b2 = −2(cid:0)ǫ − 1
2(cid:1)2

l+l− = (H2 − ǫ1 + 1)(H2 − ǫ1 − 1)(H2 − 1/2).

Once again the set {H2, l+, l−} realizes the second-order PHA and the sought extremal states are now

φε1 ∝

φε2 ∝ B+a+u1,

φε3 ∝ B+e

which correspond to the (formal) eigenvalues ǫ1 − 1, ǫ1 + 1, 1

A similar procedure as for H1 gives the PIV solutions Gi(x) in terms of α = u′

4 Painlev´e V equation

In the last section, the second-order PHA’s were connected to the PIV equation. Is there something similar for
third-order PHA’s? Consider a set {H, L+, L−}, where L± are fourth-order ladder operators such that

[H, L±] = ±2L±,
[L−, L+] = P3(H),

To realize such an algebraic structure in terms of diﬀerential operators, choose L+ = L+

P3(H) being a polynomial of third degree in the Hamiltonian H, i.e., we are dealing with a third-order PHA.

The solution w(z) of the PV equation characterizes completely the third-order PHA described above. Con-
versely, one can use known realizations of the third-order PHA to obtain solutions to the PV equation. In this
section one uses the supersymmetric partners of the truncated oscillator to build such realizations. For this
purpose, let us study the product L+L−, factorized as

L+L− = (H − ε1) (H − ε2) (H − ε3) (H − ε4) .

This indicates that H has four extremal states φε1 , φε2 , φε3 and φε4 corresponding to the eigenvalues ε1, ε2, ε3
and ε4 respectively which are also annihilated by L−.

It can be shown now that

w(z) = 1 +

√2z
g(p z
2 )

is a solution of the PV equation as long as g(x) = −x − (ln [W (φε3 , φε4 )])′ and x = p z

extremal states the choice of φε3 , φε4 is arbitrary, so one has six identiﬁcations for said pair.

For H = H1, along with the third-order ladder operators of the last section one can deﬁne fourth-order ones
L± = A+(a±)2A, where a± are again the usual ﬁrst-order ladder operators of the harmonic oscillator. Note
that this time the ladder operators move among physical levels in the energy spectrum, i.e., their steps have
size two.

Thus, solutions to the PV equation are at hand through the procedure detailed above, with the extremal

On the other hand, for H = H2 one can deﬁne natural ladder operators through L± = B+(a±)2B, but these
are of sixth-order, thus one needs again a reduction theorem. Such a theorem is a slight generalization of the
one in [24], but for energy spectra of arbitrary constant spacing. In the present case, where the spacing is two,
it asserts that when u2 = (a−)2u1 and ǫ2 = ǫ1 − 2, there exists also a pair of fourth-order ladder operators l±
for H2 such that

l+l− = (H2 − ǫ1 + 2) (H2 − ǫ1 − 2)(cid:18)H2 −

5 B¨acklund transformations

Several solutions of the PIV and PV equations have been obtained in the previous sections using a method that
exploits the connection between PHA of second and third-order, realized by supersymmetric partners of the
truncated oscillator, and these two non-linear second-order diﬀerential equations.

In each case the solutions were obtained through a simple method which, however does not show clearly a
possible relation among them. This section shall provide an insight on this relation in the language of B¨acklund
transformations.

A B¨acklund transformation (BT) between two partial diﬀerential equations

D(u; x, t) = 0,

E(V ; X, T ) = 0

is generally deﬁned as a set of relations involving {x, t, u(x, t)}, {X, T, V (X, T )} and derivatives of u and V such
that [46]:

1. the BT is integrable for V if and only if D(u) = 0;

2. the BT is integrable for u if and only if E(V ) = 0;

3. given u such that D(u) = 0, the BT deﬁnes V up to a ﬁnite number of constants, and E(V ) = 0;

4. given V such that E(V ) = 0, the BT deﬁnes u up to a ﬁnite number of constants, and D(u) = 0.

(Remember that vx = f (x, t) and vt = g(x, t) are integrable for v iﬀ vxt = vtx; i.e., they must be compatible).
Alternatively, as described informally in [44], a B¨acklund transformation relates one solution of a given
equation either to another solution of the same equation, possibly with diﬀerent values of the parameters, or to
a solution of another equation.

In the following subsections we will ﬁnd the B¨acklund transformations relating the previously obtained solu-
tions of the PIV and PV equations separately. For some transformations the calculations are shown explicitly;
however, for others only the ﬁnal results will be depicted, due to the length of the expressions involved.

First of all this diagram is valid for the pair of parameters a, b of each equation, but, Is this also true for

the solutions? The answer is positive, and this comes about from the following reasoning.

From the Schr¨odinger equation, rewritten as u′′ = (x2 − 2ǫ)u, and the expression g1 = −x + α one gets

u − α2 = −1 + x2 − 2ǫ − (x + g1)2. Now, use the expression for g2 in terms of g1,

g′1 = −1 + u′′

to rewrite g2 as

= g1 + 2(cid:18)−g′1(g1 + x) − x − (2ǫ − x2)(g1 + x) − (g1 + x)3
= g1 + 2(cid:18)−g′1(g1 + x) − x + (1 − 1 − 2ǫ + x2 − (g1 + x)2)(g1 + x)

This last equation can be expanded into

This expression coincides with the result of the third transformation in table 4a in [44] applied to g1:

which establishes the validity of the ﬁrst transformation in the diagram.

Now, from the results g2 = g1 + 2 g1

g′′1 = 2 (x − (x + g1)(1 + g′1)), such that

Then one can write

The last is exactly the expression for g3 in terms of g1 found in Section 3, which proves the second transformation
in the diagram.

To establish the third transformation diﬀerentiate ﬁrst g3

Thus

g′3 =

(2 + g′1)2 + 2(g1 + 2x)(xg′1 + g1g′1 + g1)

Now, since g1 = α − x then g′1 = −1 − 2ǫ − 2xg1 − g2

Therefore, one can conclude that G1 = ˜W + [g3].

Next, from G1 = −x − α + 2
G′1 = −1 − α′ + 2

= −1 + α2 + 2ǫ − x2 + 2

Then transforming G1 with W ‡− one gets

On the other hand, if one substitutes G1 = −x − α + 2

x2+1−2ǫ−α2 into G3 one gets

G3 =

.

(8)

Therefore G3 = W ‡− [G1].

expression for W ‡+ [G3] as follows

Finally a similar treatment to the previous transformations shows that G2 = W ‡+ [G3]. One starts with the

W ‡+ [G3] = G3 +

(4ǫ + 2)G3

G′3 + 4 − 2xG3 − G2

where G3 is given by equation (8). The expressions involved in the calculations that follow this result become
lengthy thus we shall not show them explicitly. Just as in the previous cases, however, one can see that the
procedure is straightforward.

5.2 Painlev´e V

In [45] the authors already studied the BT’s of the ﬁfth Painlev´e equation by considering a solution w =
w(z; α, β, γ, δ) with parameters α, β, γ, δ 6= 0, such that

F1(w) = zw′ − k1cw2 + (k1c − k2a + k3hz)w + k2a 6= 0,

where c2 = 2α, a2 = −2β, h2 = −2δ. Then, they found that the transformation

Tk1,k2,k3 : w(z; α, β, γ, δ) → w1(z; α1, β1, γ1, δ1) = 1 − 2k3hzwF −1

1

deﬁnes another solution w1(z; α1, β1, γ1, δ1) of the PV equation with parameters

α1 = −

1
16δ

[γ + k3h(1 − k2a − k1c)]2 ,
γ1 = k3h(k2a − k1c),

β1 =

1
16δ
δ1 = δ,

[γ − k3h(1 − k2a − k1c)]2 ,

where k2

i = 1, i ∈ 1, 2, 3. Thus Tk1,k2,k3 is a BT for the PV equation.

Now, for a ﬁxed value of ǫ in a ﬁrst-order transformation and ǫ1 in a second-order transformation such that

ǫ1 = ǫ we ﬁnd that Tk1,k2,k3 is a BT for the solutions found in Section 4 in the following cases:

• Tk1,k2,k3 : w1b → w2a whenever k1 = −1, k2 = 1, k3 = 1 if ǫ < − 3

6 Conclusions

This paper is a natural continuation of the work begun in [28], where non-singular SUSY transformations of
ﬁrst- and second-order were applied to the truncated oscillator and several solutions to the Painlev´e IV equation
were obtained exploiting the connection between the algebraic structure of the supersymmetric partners of the
truncated oscillator (second-order Polynomial Heisenberg Algebras) and the Painlev´e IV equation.

In this work we realize that one can also deﬁne fourth-order ladder operators for the SUSY partners of
the truncated oscillator in such a way that these systems are characterized as well by third-order Polynomial
Heisenberg Algebras. This fact was used to relate the extremal states of these Hamiltonians to several solutions
of the Painlev´e V equation, resulting in a set of explicit expressions for such solutions in terms of a ﬁxed
parameter.

Finally, in order to gain a better insight of the relation among the solutions generated through said procedure,
we identiﬁed the B¨acklund transformations connecting the solutions we produced for the PIV and PV equations,
respectively. We have shown that Painlev´e solutions generated by SUSY transformations of diﬀerent orders are
connected; from the physical viewpoint this is unexpected since, in general, the spectra of the ﬁrst-order SUSY
partners of H0 and those of second order are diﬀerent. We conclude that important new information for such
SUSY generated solutions has been obtained in this paper.
