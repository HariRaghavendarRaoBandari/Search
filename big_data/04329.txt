We propose an eﬀective two-band Hamiltonian for the electronic states in graphene based on a
Taylor expansion of the tight-binding Hamiltonian about the time-reversal invariant M point at the
edge of the Brillouin zone. This Hamiltonian provides an accurate description of the topologically
protected edge states for both zigzag and armchair edges in graphene ribbons although the concept of
a Brillouin is not part of such an eﬀective model. The model highlights the importance of boundary
conditions for the occurrence of edge states. Such states occur for band inversion or a mass domain
wall at the edge of the ribbon, but they are absent otherwise.

A topological insulator is an insulator in the bulk with
topologically protected edge states that cross the gap so
that the edges are conducting. This concept was ﬁrst in-
troduced by Kane and Mele using a simple tight-binding
(TB) model for the band structure of graphene [1, 2].
Since then a wide range of materials with these prop-
erties have been identiﬁed in two and three dimensions
(2D and 3D) [3, 4]. Topological insulators can be distin-
guished from trivial insulators without topological edge
states by the values of one or multiple topological invari-
ants that require an analysis of the bulk band structure
across the Brillouin zone. In that sense topological in-
sulators are considered conceptually diﬀerent from other
problems in solid state physics that permit a description
local in k space. A major aspect motivating the inter-
est in topological insulators lies in the fact that elastic
backscattering from a random potential preserving time
reversal symmetry is forbidden in these edge states [2].

The ﬁrst experimental veriﬁcation of topologically pro-
tected edge states was achieved for HgTe/CdTe quan-
tum wells (QWs) [5] following a theoretical proposal by
Bernevig, Hughes and Zhang [6] based on a simple eﬀec-
tive Hamiltonian, today known as the BHZ model. Since
then the BHZ model has been used in a wide range of
studies. Liu et al. showed [7] that it also describes the
edge states in InAs/GaSb QWs. Zhou et al. showed [8]
that the BHZ model can be solved exactly, yielding an-
alytical expressions for the edge states in HgTe/CdTe
QWs, see also Ref. 9. Zhou’s work [8] raised the question
to what extent topological insulators permit a description
local in k space, i.e., using a model not involving the con-
cept of a Brillouin zone [10]. Graphene with its simple
TB description [1, 2, 11, 12] has served as an archetype
for topological insulators, despite the fact that its intrin-
sic SO coupling has been found to be small [13]. We
show here that a Taylor expansion of the graphene TB
model about the time-reversal invariant M point of the
Brillouin zone yields an eﬀective Hamiltonian that pro-
vides an accurate description local in k space of the edge
states in both zigzag and armchair graphene ribbons.

In the following our conventions for the TB Hamilto-
nian follow Refs. [1, 2], see also Ref. [14]. While the
graphene Brillouin zone has two inequivalent points K

and K(cid:48), we have three inequivalent points M , M(cid:48) and
M(cid:48)(cid:48), see Fig. 1(a). Expanding the TB Hamiltonian for

where si denotes spin operators and σi are Pauli matri-
ces referring to a basis that diagonalizes HM (k) in the
limit k → 0. The ﬁrst term describes the orbital motion
characterized by the nearest-neighbor hopping parame-
ter t. In the following we assume t = 1, i.e., we measure
all energies in units of t. Similarly, lengths are measured
in units of the lattice constant a. The second term de-
scribes a staggered sublattice potential weighted by λv
[1, 2]. The third term gives the intrinsic spin-orbit (SO)
coupling proportional to the parameter λi. The fourth
term describes the Rashba SO coupling weighted by the
parameter λr.

First we discuss the properties of the Hamiltonian (1)
in the absence of SO coupling. Unlike the Bloch states at
the K point [15], the Bloch states at the M point [i.e., the
eigenstates of the Hamiltonian (1) for k = 0 which are

where we also included the sublattice staggering ∝ λv
and the intrinsic SO coupling ∝ λi for later reference.
For small k, Eq. (3) is close to the Dirac Hamiltonian
√
2 (±kxσx − kyσy) obtained via a Taylor expan-
HD =
sion of the TB Hamiltonian about K and K(cid:48) [13]. The
Hamiltonian (1) thus captures the essential features of
the graphene multivalley band structure for both the con-
duction and valence band near the entire line K−M−K(cid:48).
Recently multivalley band structures such as the one re-
alized in graphene have attracted signiﬁcant interest in
the context of valleytronics. Here multiple valleys are
usually described as replicas of a single-valley Hamilto-
nian using a valley-pseudospin as a separate degree of
freedom [16], which corresponds to the two signs in HD.
The multivalley Hamiltonian (1) thus provides an alter-
native approach to such scenarios, using nonetheless the
powerful language of eﬀective Hamiltonians. We note
that the Hamiltonian (1) accounts for time reversal sym-
metry in a natural way, which reﬂects the fact that the
M point used here as expansion point is known as time-
reversal invariant momentum [17]. We also note that it
follows immediately from Eq. (3) that λv (cid:54)= 0 opens a
gap 2|λv| at k = (±2, 0).

weights for A and B) so that here σz does not permit an

To discuss edge states we consider graphene ribbons
with so-called zigzag [Fig. 2(a)] and armchair edges
[Fig. 2(b)]. The bulk band structure of the 1D ribbons
can be obtained by projecting the bulk band structure
of 2D graphene on the axis along the ribbon. It follows
that the electronic states in these ribbons around energy
E = 0 emerge from the states in 2D graphene which are
highlighted in green in Fig. 2(c) and (d).

First we focus on zigzag edges [Fig. 2(a)]. We denote
the wave vector for the unconﬁned motion along the di-
rection of the ribbon as k(cid:107) and the perpendicular compo-
nent as k⊥. Ignoring SO coupling, zigzag edges give rise
to a gapped spectrum around k(cid:107) = 0 with edge states
appearing in the center of the gap [18]. These results are
readily rederived by means of Hamiltonian (1), where a
suitable coordinate transformation gives the Hamiltonian

Hamiltonian (4) corresponds to the point ˜k(cid:107) = π of the
1D Brillouin zone for zigzag ribbons [see, e.g., Fig. 2(b)
in Ref. 18].

We assume as in Refs. 1, 2, and 18 that the edges are
interfaces towards vacuum. Within the framework of ef-
fective Hamiltonians, we use the Hamiltonian (4) for both
graphene and vacuum with suitable distinct band param-
eters for each region, combined with the usual match-
ing conditions at the interfaces to ensure hermiticity of
the resulting eigenvalue problem [19, 20]. For concep-
tual simplicity we vary only one band parameter across
the graphene-vacuum interface, either the gap or the pre-
factor of the term ∝ k2⊥σz. In either case, this is done
symmetrically for both spinor components so that we pre-
serve the electron-hole symmetry in the spectrum of the
Hamiltonian. In the end we may consider the limit where
these band parameters for vacuum are chosen such that
the graphene wave functions vanish at the interface.

The edge states obtained by means of Hamiltonian (4)
are shown in Fig. 2(e).
In these calculations, we con-
ﬁned the electrons inside the graphene ribbon by adding
the term bσz to the Hamiltonian (4) with b ≡ bg = 0
inside the graphene ribbon and b ≡ bv = −10 in vac-
uum. Having bv < 0 implies a band inversion at the
graphene-vacuum interface [21]. A simple conﬁnement
bv > 0 results in the spectrum shown in Fig. 3(b), where
we have the same bulk spectrum as in Fig. 2(e), but
the edge states appear for |k(cid:107)| >∼ 1. The latter type of

spectrum is obtained in TB calculations for ribbons with
“dangling” zigzag edges [22], see Fig. 3(a). We have thus
a direct correspondence between the boundary conditions
in a TB description of graphene ribbons and the bound-
ary conditions for the eﬀective Hamiltonian used here.
In our approach we may alternatively describe the inter-
face via a position-dependent prefactor µ for the term
∝ k2⊥σz. Again the bulk spectrum of the ribbon does not
depend on the sign of µ in vacuum. But edge states as in
Fig. 2(e) occur only for a sign change of µ corresponding
to a mass domain wall at the interface [23, 24], whereas
without a sign reversal of µ we obtain a spectrum as in
Fig. 3(b). Either band inversion or a mass domain wall
are thus required to obtain edge states near k(cid:107) = 0. In
that sense these requirements may be considered here as
equivalent for the occurrence of edge states. In the fol-
lowing we focus on bv < 0.

The numerical calculations presented in this work use a
quadrature method as described in Refs. 25 and 26, which
automatically ensures the proper matching conditions for
the multi-spinor wave function at the graphene-vacuum
interface. The numerical results can be conﬁrmed by
analytical calculations similar to those in Refs. 8 and 9.
In particular, the limit of hard walls bv → −∞ yields for
the edge state at k(cid:107) = 0 of a semi-inﬁnite graphene sheet

they are not reproduced here. Yet such calculations con-
ﬁrm that no edge states exist around k(cid:107) = 0 for bv > 0.

see Fig. 2(d). The 1D spectrum resulting from this
Hamiltonian is shown in Fig. 2(f). Here we have no edge
states (for either sign of bv) and in the limit of wide rib-
bons the spectrum becomes gapless. These results are
consistent with the ﬁndings in Ref. 18, keeping in mind
that the bulk K and K(cid:48) points are folded to the point
˜k(cid:107) = 0 of the 1D Brillouin zone for armchair ribbons.

Previously Brey and Fertig [27] used the graphene
Dirac Hamiltonian HD to obtain the edge states of 1D
ribbons emerging from the states near the K point of
2D graphene [28], i.e., their model gives the edge states
for wave vectors close to the valence band maximum and
conduction band minimum in Figs. 2(e) and (f). The
present approach is diﬀerent from this earlier work as
it yields the edge states in the entire region in between
the points K and K(cid:48) of the bulk band structure, consis-
tent with the TB description [18]. Eﬀective Hamiltonians
based on a Taylor expansion of the band structure are
often low-energy Hamiltonians that are valid only in the
vicinity of the expansion point [19, 20]. Yet this is not
an inherent constraint as previously shown by Cardona
and Pollak [29] who developed a full-zone k · p method
for germanium and silicon. The present work follows a
similar spirit as Ref. 29 by providing an eﬀective Hamil-
tonian that is valid for a large range of wave vectors and
a large range of energies.

(cid:112)1 − 16λ2

Next we discuss the eﬀect of SO coupling. First we
consider λr = 0. The intrinsic SO coupling ∝ λi opens
i ≈ 16λi in the bulk spectrum of
a gap 16λi
√
the Hamiltonian (1).
In the TB model this gap takes
3λi [2]. For λi (cid:54)= 0 the edge states in a
the value 6
zigzag ribbon remain two-fold degenerate at k(cid:107) = 0 which
reﬂects the fact that these states originate from the time-
reversal invariant M point of the graphene Brillouin zone.
This aspect is thus readily captured by the Hamiltonian
(1) that stems from an expansion about the M point,
as demonstrated in Fig. 2(g). For k(cid:107) (cid:54)= 0, the two-fold
degeneracy is lifted and the branches ultimately merge
with the bulk conduction and valence band [1, 2].
Both the intrinsic SO coupling ∝ λi and the sublat-
tice staggering ∝ λv open a gap in the bulk spectrum
of the Hamiltonian (1). Yet it follows immediately from
Eq. (3) that the gap closes for λv = ±8λi. Consistent
with the TB results in Ref. [1] this set of parameters
describes the phase boundary between the topologically
trivial regime with an even number of edge states and
the nontrivial regime with an odd number of edge states
crossing the bulk gap. Similarly, Rashba SO coupling
∝ λr induces such a phase transition when it competes
with the intrinsic SO coupling. We illustrate this point
for our approach in Fig. 4 showing two calculations for
zigzag ribbons with λi = 0.09 and λr = 0.05. The sub-
lattice staggering λv = 0.1 [Fig. 4(a)] gives rise to edge
states crossing the gap, whereas λv = 0.4 [Fig. 4(b)] re-
sults in an ordinary insulator, where the edge states do
not cross the bulk gap. These calculations are in good
agreement with the TB results in Fig. 1 of Ref. 1.

Next we discuss the eﬀect of SO coupling on the spec-
trum of ribbons with armchair edges. Similar to the band
structure of 2D graphene, intrinsic SO coupling opens a
gap in the spectrum of armchair ribbons. Furthermore,
we obtain edge states in the center of the gap which, for
increasing λi, develop from the bulk k(cid:107) = 0 states in the
absence of SO coupling. The spectrum in Fig. 2(h) is in
good agreement with TB calculations analogous to those
described in Refs. 1 and 2.

Using an eﬀective Hamiltonian as in Eq. (1) we can
readily include a range of perturbations such as homoge-
neous or inhomogeneous [12] magnetic and electric ﬁelds
or strain which may break the periodicity of the ideal
crystal structure [30]. To illustrate this point we con-
sider a zigzag ribbon in the presence of an exchange ﬁeld
λxsz and Rashba SO coupling ∝ λr, which gives rise to
the quantum anomalous Hall eﬀect [31], see Fig. 5(a). If
the exchange ﬁeld λx is due to paramagnetic ions [32],
a magnetic ﬁeld is normally required to induce the ex-
change splitting. Here we incorporate an external mag-
netic ﬁeld Bz perpendicular to the plane of the ribbon via
the usual Peierls substitution k(cid:107) → k(cid:107) + Bzr⊥, where r⊥
denotes the spatial coordinate conjugate to k⊥. A mag-
netic ﬁeld Bz = 0.02 signiﬁcantly distorts the dispersion
E(k(cid:107)) [Fig. 5(b)], but the edge states crossing the gap
are robust under such a perturbation.

Finally we comment on the general robustness of the
edge states, which is a major aspect motivating the in-
terest in topological insulators [3, 4]. It was pointed out
in Ref. 2 that the edge states at ±k(cid:107) form a Kramers
doublet so that elastic backscattering from a random po-
tential preserving time reversal symmetry is forbidden. If
the electron states in graphene are modeled by means of
the low-energy Dirac Hamiltonian HD, the two valleys at
K and K(cid:48) are described via a discrete valley pseudospin
degree of freedom, that makes it diﬃcult to incorporate
intervalley scattering in a general way. For the eﬀective
Hamiltonian (1) pairs of time-reversed states are con-
nected by continuous paths in the Hilbert space of this
Hamiltonian so that it is well-suited to incorporate inter-
valley scattering, though a detailed study of this point is
beyond the scope of the present work.

In conclusion, the eﬀective Hamiltonian (1) based on
an expansion of the graphene TB Hamiltonian about the
time-reversal invariant M point provides an accurate de-
scription of many facets of the topologically protected
edge states in graphene, although the concept of a Bril-
louin is not part of such an eﬀective model. Our work
suggests that eﬀective Hamiltonians may exist also for

other topologically protected systems. This opens an
avenue for studying these systems under perturbations
breaking the periodicity of the crystal structure so that
it is more diﬃcult to incorporate such eﬀects in micro-
scopic calculations. RW appreciates stimulating discus-
