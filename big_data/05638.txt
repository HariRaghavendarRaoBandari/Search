ABSTRACT

We announce the discovery of the transiting hot Jupiter WASP-157b in a 3.95-d orbit around a
V = 12.9 G2 main-sequence star. This moderately inﬂated planet has a Saturn-like density with a
mass of 0.57 ± 0.10 MJup and radius 1.04 ± 0.04 RJup. The small projected stellar rotational velocity
of 1.0 ± 0.9 km s−1 suggests that the host star is a slow rotator or that the star rotates close to pole-
on. We do not detect any rotational or phase-curve modulations, nor the secondary eclipse, with
conservative semi-amplitude upper limits of 250 and 30 ppm, respectively.
Keywords: planets and satellites: detection – planets and satellites: individual (WASP-157b) – stars:

individual (WASP-157)

INTRODUCTION

The ﬁelds along the ecliptic being observed by the Ke-
pler K2 mission (Howell et al. 2014) contain planets dis-
covered by the WASP transit search (Pollacco et al. 2006)
and so K2 is also observing current WASP candidates.
K2’s high-precision photometry has allowed the detec-
tion of two additional close-in transiting exoplanets in
the WASP-47 system (Becker et al. 2015) and the detec-
tion of starspot occultations in WASP-85 (Moˇcnik et al.
2015), with several more WASP planets either recently
observed or scheduled for future K2 campaigns.

Here we present the discovery of a transiting hot
Jupiter WASP-157b. In Section 2 we introduce the pho-
tometric and spectroscopic datasets. Basic properties of
the host star are listed in Section 3, in Section 4 we
discuss lightcurve modulations. Description of the spec-
trophotometric analysis and a list of system parameters
are shown in Section 5, and a stellar age estimate is pro-
vided in Section 6.

2. OBSERVATIONS

WASP-157b was identiﬁed as an exoplanet candi-
date from observations with both WASP-South and
SuperWASP-North over 2008–2010 (see Table 1). For
a detailed description of the WASP telescopes, observ-
ing strategy, data reduction, and candidate identiﬁcation
and selection procedures, see Pollacco et al. (2006, 2008)
and Collier Cameron et al. (2007b). A transit was then
observed with the TRAPPIST photometer (Jehin et al.
2011; Gillon et al. 2011) on 2016 February 05.

WASP-157 (EPIC 212697709) was also observed with
K2 in the long-cadence observing mode during Campaign
6 (from 2015 July 13 to 2015 September 30). We re-
trieved the target pixel ﬁle from the Minkulski Archive

t.mocnik@keele.ac.uk

for Space Telescopes (MAST) and performed the stan-
dard data reduction and the self-ﬂat-ﬁeld (SFF) cor-
rection using PyRAF tools for Kepler (PyKE) version
2.6.2 (Still & Barclay 2012). The applied SFF correc-
tion, which is based on the procedure described in Van-
derburg & Johnson (2014), improved the median 6-hour
photometric precision from 149 parts per million (ppm)
to 29 ppm, which is comparable to original Kepler pre-
cision for a similarly bright star. After removal of all the
quality-ﬂagged data points a total of 3227 data points
remained. The reduced and normalized K2 lightcurve is
shown in Figure 1.

Spectroscopic radial velocity (RV) follow-up was per-
formed using the ﬁbre-fed CORALIE spectrograph at the
1.2-m Swiss Euler Telescope at La Silla (Queloz et al.
2000). One spectrum was obtained in 2015 June and a
further seven in 2016 February and March. Given that
WASP-157 is relatively faint at V = 12.9, we also ob-
tained spectra on four consecutive nights in 2016 March
with the HARPS spectrograph mounted at ESO 3.6-m
telescope (Mayor et al. 2003), also at La Silla observa-
tory (see Table 1). The spectroscopic data have been re-
duced with the standard HARPS and CORALIE reduc-
tion pipelines. The RVs were extracted with the weighted
cross-correlation of each spectrum with a G2 mask and
the simultaneous Th-Ar wavelength calibration reference
(see Pepe et al. (2002) for details). The resulting RVs and
bisector spans (BS) are given in Table 2.

3. SPECTRAL ANALYSIS

We analysed the spectroscopic properties of the host
star from a co-added HARPS spectrum with a ﬁnal
signal-to-noise ratio of 38. The analysis methods are de-
scribed in Gillon et al. (2009) and Doyle et al. (2013).
We used the Hα line to estimate the eﬀective tempera-
ture (Teﬀ ), and the Na i D and Mg i b lines as diagnostics

Figure 1. Normalized K2 lightcurve of WASP-157. The observing Campaign 6 covers a total of 20 transits of WASP-157b. Note, however,
that only 19 transits are visible because the data points obtained during the sixth transit were quality-ﬂagged by the K2 preprocessing
pipeline as a detector anomaly and were thus removed from the ﬁnal lightcurve. The ﬂux excursions in the ﬁnal lightcurve are of instrumental
origin, such as cosmic rays that have not been properly ﬂagged by the preprocessing pipeline.

velocity (v sin I) was determined by ﬁtting the proﬁles
of the Fe i lines after convolving with the HARPS in-
strumental resolution (R = 120 000) and a macrotur-
bulent velocity adopted from the calibration of Doyle
et al. (2014). The iron abundances were determined from
equivalent width measurements of several clean and un-
blended Fe i lines and are given relative to the solar value
presented in Asplund et al. (2009). The [Fe/H] abun-
dance error includes that given by the uncertainties in
Teﬀ and log g, as well as the scatter due to measurement
and atomic data uncertainties. The resulting parameters
are listed in Table 3. Only an upper limit is given for Li
abundance since we do not detect Li line at 6707.79 ˚A,
with an upper limit of 2 m˚A.

We searched for any rotational modulation of WASP-
157 using 2.2 yr of WASP lightcurves, following the pro-
cedure of Maxted et al. (2011). We found no modulations
with semi-amplitudes above 2 mmag, which suggests that
the host star is inactive.

We also searched the 79-d K2 lightcurve for any co-
herent rotational or phase-curve modulations including
a secondary eclipse, but none were detected, with con-
servative semi-amplitude upper limits of 250 and 30 ppm,
respectively. Figure 2 shows the K2 lightcurve folded on
the orbital period of the planet along with a reﬂection
modulation model with a semi-amplitude of 30 ppm.

To look for any additional transiting planets we ex-
amined the periodogram obtained with PyKE tool KEP-
BLS which searches for periodic transits by utilizing
the box least square ﬁtting algorithm by Kov´acs et al.
(2002). After removing WASP-157b’s transits from the

bins, (shown in black) and a simulated reﬂection phase-curve mod-
ulation with a semi-amplitude of 30 ppm (red). The absence of any
visible reﬂection modulation or secondary eclipse in the measured
phase-curve of similar amplitude as shown in the simulated phase-
curve suggests that the actual reﬂection semi-amplitude is lower
than 30 ppm.

K2 lightcurve by replacing the measured normalised ﬂux
values around transits with unity, we do not ﬁnd any
signiﬁcant residual peaks in the period region between
0.5 and 30 d. The upper limit for additional transits is
250 ppm.

Transit-timing variations (TTVs) and transit-duration
variations (TDVs) can also reveal additional planets in
the system (e.g. Mazeh et al. (2013) and citations
therein). However, we were unable to perform TTV and
TDV analysis because the individual transits were un-
dersampled in the K2 lightcurve due to the long-cadence
observing mode.

5. SYSTEM PARAMETERS

To obtain stellar and planetary parameters we carried
out a simultaneous Monte Carlo (MC) analysis of the
photometric and spectroscopic datasets. For analysing
the transit shape we used primarily the K2 data, which
have the best photometric precision, although with a 30-
min cadence.

Since the eﬀective exposure time of K2 long-cadence
observations is signiﬁcant compared to the time-scale at
which the transit features occur, we performed an MC
analysis where the transit model was computed with
a sampling of 3 min, and integrated to the 30-min K2

sampling, to avoid any systematic errors on the transit
parameters due to the “smearing” eﬀect. The analysis
1
was performed with publicly available software JKTEBOP
(Southworth et al. 2004). JKTEBOP is based on the earlier
EBOP code by Popper & Etzel (1981), and has been mod-
iﬁed, among many improvements and enhancements, to
allow for a simultaneous ﬁt of photometric data and RV
measurements (Southworth 2013). The smearing correc-
tion can be seen by comparing the numerically integrated
JKTEBOP ﬁt with the K2 data in Figure 3. Quadratic
limb-darkening was used in the JKTEBOP analysis.

For determining the ephemeris we also included the
WASP and TRAPPIST photometry, which extended the
photometric baseline from 79 d to 7.8 yr. We produced
a separate Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis
of all the datasets using the code presented in Collier
Cameron et al. (2007a) and further described in Pollacco
et al. (2008) and Anderson et al. (2015). We accounted
for limb-darkening by interpolating within tables of four-
parameter limb-darkening coeﬃcients from Claret (2000,
2004) and Sing (2010), as appropriate for diﬀerent ﬁlters
used among the three photometric datasets (see Table 1).
We checked the compatibility between the analysis us-
ing JKTEBOP with the K2 data, and the MCMC analysis
of the ground-based observations alone. The resulting
parameters are fully consistent. We present the system
parameters in Table 4 and superimpose the correspond-
ing transit model on the measured lightcurves and RVs
in Figure 3 and Figure 4, respectively.

The bottom panel of Figure 4 shows the measured bi-
sector span (BS) for each spectrum, which characterises
the asymmetry in the stellar line proﬁles (Queloz et al.
2001). A signiﬁcant correlation between BS and RV may
indicate a transit mimic , such as a blended eclipsing bi-
nary (Queloz et al. 2001). We, however, do not measure
any statistically signiﬁcant correlation between RVs and
BSs.

The low projected stellar rotational velocity, together
with the stellar radius (Table 4) would imply, if the star’s
spin axis were orthogonal to us, a rotation period of
56+530−28 d. This would be unusually slow rotation; accord-
ing to a list by McQuillan et al. (2014) of 4355 main-
sequence stars with Teﬀ between 5700 K and 5980 K, the
mean rotational period is 12.3 d with a standard devia-
tion of 7.2 d. Thus it is likely that WASP-157’s spin axis
is not orthogonal to us and that we are seeing the star
pole-on. This would imply that the orbit of WASP-157b
is not aligned.

6. STELLAR AGE

An age constraint can be evaluated through a compar-
ison to theoretical stellar models. As in Maxted et al.
(2016) we compare ρ(cid:63) and T eﬀ to isochrones and evalu-
ate the age of the star using the Bayesian mass and age
estimator BAGEMASS by Maxted et al. (2015). The stellar
evolution models used in BAGEMASS were calculated us-
ing GARSTEC code (Weiss & Schlattl 2008). The best-ﬁt
stellar evolution track is shown in Figure 5 and provides
an age estimate of 1.0+2.8−0.3 Gyr.

The measured Li abundance upper limit of log A(Li) <
0.9 (see Table 3), indicates that the star is older than

7. CONCLUSIONS

WASP-157b is very much a typical hot Jupiter. The
orbital period of 3.95 d is typical, while the moderately
inﬂated size (1.0 RJup for 0.57 MJup) is also character-
istic of hot Jupiters. The impact parameter is higher
than average, leading to a shorter, v-shaped transit. The
small stellar v sin I indicates that the orbit might be mis-
aligned. WASP-157 is notable for now being one of fewer
than a dozen hot-Jupiter hosts with V < 13 to have a
Kepler -quality lightcurve.
