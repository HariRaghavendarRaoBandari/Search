We study the stability, form and interaction of single and multiple dark solitons in quasi-one-
dimensional dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates. The solitons are found numerically as stationary
solutions in the moving frame of a non-local Gross Pitaevskii equation, and characterized as a
function of the key experimental parameters, namely the ratio of the dipolar atomic interactions
to the van der Waals interactions, the polarization angle and the condensate width. The solutions
and their integrals of motion are strongly aﬀected by the phonon and roton instabilities of the
system. Dipolar matter-wave dark solitons propagate without dispersion, and collide elastically
away from these instabilities, with the dipolar interactions contributing an additional repulsion or
attraction to the soliton-soliton interaction. However, close to the instabilities, the collisions are
weakly dissipative.

INTRODUCTION

Solitary waves, or solitons, are excitations of nonlin-
ear systems that possess both wave-like and particle-like
qualities. They obey wave equations and yet do not dis-
perse, maintaining their shape and speed by balancing
dispersion with nonlinearity. Solitons appear across a
wide range of physical systems that include water, light,
plasmas and liquid crystals [1], and have been touted as
playing a fundamental role in the fabric of our universe
[2]. A more recent addition to this list is the atomic Bose-
Einstein condensate (BEC) formed in an ultracold gas de-
scribed by a nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation known as the
Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE). Experimental demon-
strations of solitons in BECs include both the generation
of dark solitons [3–11], and bright solitons [12–17]. The
interaction between the atoms in these experiments was
short range and isotropic (predominantly of the van der
Waals type) giving a local cubic nonlinearity in the GPE,
with dark and bright solitons supported for repulsive
and attractive nonlinearity, respectively. In binary con-
densates, dark-bright soliton complexes have also been
probed experimentally [8, 18]. The experiments conﬁrm
that solitons in BECs and in classical systems such as wa-
ter or light are for many purposes the same phenomenon
and share the same three particle-like deﬁning proper-
ties, namely: permanent form, localization within a re-
gion, and emergence from collisions with other solitons
unaltered, except for a phase shift [19]. It is important to
bear in mind, however, that in BECs the soliton relies on
quantum mechanical coherence across the sample, and is
at heart a probability wave [20].

Ultracold Bose gases provide an appealing system in
which to explore soliton physics because of the almost
complete absence of dissipation (due to the superﬂuid
nature of the gas) and the high degree of experimental
control that can be exerted over the atoms and their in-
teractions using lasers as well as magnetic and electric
ﬁelds. This, for example, has led to proposals to access

exotic solitons such as in spin-orbit coupled condensates
[21–23], and chiral solitons in ‘interacting’ gauge theories
[24], and non-local solitons in dipolar condensates [25–
28] which are the subject of this paper. Furthermore,
matter-wave solitons have been proposed for applications
in precision interferometry [12, 17, 29, 30] and surface in-
terrogation [31].

The experimental achievement of condensation of
bosonic elements possessing large magnetic dipole mo-
ments — 52Cr [32, 33], 164Dy [34, 35] and 168Er [36] —
has opened yet another chapter in BEC physics. Dipoles
have long-range anisotropic interactions, in contrast to
the usual short-range isotropic interactions, and hence
give rise to an additional non-local nonlinearity [37]. This
has striking consequences, as observed experimentally
in the form of magnetostriction of the condensate [38]
and shape-dependent stability [39], anisotropic collapse
and explosion [40], and droplet formation analogous to
the Rosensweig instability in classical ferroﬂuids [41, 42].
This modulational instability is a direct result of the ro-
ton dip the dipolar interactions introduce into the exci-
tation spectrum [43, 44].

A series of theoretical investigations have indicated
that dipolar interactions also considerably enrich the

FIG. 1.
(Color online) We consider an elongated Bose-
Einstein condensate of atoms (shown as a density isosur-
face) with dipole moments (shown as arrows) which are co-
polarized in a common direction. For suitable interaction pa-
rameters, a dark soliton can be supported, characterized by a
1D density notch and a non-trivial 1D phase slip.

properties of solitons. In quasi-one-dimensional geome-
tries, bright [25] and dark solitons [27, 28] can be sup-
ported when the net (van der Waals and dipolar) inter-
actions are attractive and repulsive, respectively. Dark-
in-bright and bright-in-dark dipolar solitons have also
been predicted [49]. Yet perhaps the most interesting
facet of solitons in general are their interactions and col-
lisions [50], and in dipolar condensates the solitons them-
selves, considered as individual particle-like entities, in-
herit non-local soliton-soliton interactions in addition to
the usual short-range soliton-soliton interaction [25, 28].
The play oﬀ between these two contributions can lead to
the formation of unconventional bound states of bright
[26] and dark solitons [27, 28]. Dipole-dipole interactions
are also predicted to support two-dimensional bright soli-
tons in quasi-2D geometries [45–47], and suppress the
well-known transverse “snaking” instability of dark soli-
tons in three-dimensional geometries [48].

In a recent work [28], we predicted the existence of dark
soliton solutions in a homogeneous quasi-one-dimensional
dipolar condensate (shown schematically in Fig. 1), and
studied the non-local interaction between two such soli-
tons. Here we expand upon this topic by presenting a
comprehensive analysis of the family of dark soliton so-
lutions and their interactions, across the main system
parameters, namely the angle of polarization, the rela-
tive strength of the dipolar interactions, the soliton speed
and the width of the quasi-1D system. In order to un-
derstand the regimes of soliton stability, we establish the
stability properties of the soliton-free ground state of the
system; this allows us to relate the soliton stability to the
phonon and roton instabilities of the system. We exam-
ine the family of single soliton solutions, including their
integrals of motion, and ﬁnally explore the soliton-soliton
collisions through simulations of the dipolar GPE.

The main body of the paper is organized into four sec-
tions. In Sec. II we derive the mean-ﬁeld equation of mo-
tion for the dipolar condensate. Following this in Sec. III
we analyze the homogeneous system, obtaining analyti-
cal expressions for the position of the phonon and roton
instabilities. Section IV begins with a description of the
numerical methods used to obtain the solutions of the
dipolar GPE shown in this and in following Sec. V. Our
ﬁndings are summarized in the conclusion, Sec. VI.

II. MEAN-FIELD MODEL OF THE DIPOLAR

CONDENSATE

We consider a gaseous BEC of ultracold weakly-
interacting atoms with mass m and permanent magnetic
dipole moment d. Within the mean-ﬁeld Gross-Pitaevskii
theory, the atom-atom interaction in the low energy limit
is described by the pseudo-potential

U (r − r(cid:48)) = gδ(r − r(cid:48)) + Udd(r − r(cid:48)).

(1)

The ﬁrst term arises from the short range isotropic van
der Waals-type interactions, where g = 4π¯h2as/m and as

deﬁnes the s-wave scattering length. The long-range and
anisotropic interaction appears as the bare dipole-dipole
interaction between point dipoles [51, 52]

where Cdd = 4πd2 characterizes the strength of the
dipole-dipole interaction and ˆej is the unit vector in the
coordinate direction ˆrj. Equation (2) can also be written
as

Udd(r − r(cid:48)) =

1 − 3 cos2 θ
|r − r(cid:48)|3

,

Cdd

(3)

where the angle θ is deﬁned between the vector joining
the dipoles and the polarization direction (see Fig. 1).
At the so called magic angle θm (cid:39) 54◦, the dipole-dipole
interaction reduces to zero. Assuming Cdd > 0, then for
θ < θm (dipoles orientated predominantly head-to-tail)
the dipolar interaction is attractive. For θ > θm (dipoles
dominantly side-by-side) the interaction is repulsive. It
is also possible to consider a regime of “anti-dipoles”,
Cdd < 0, as proposed in Ref. [53] by rapidly rotating the
dipoles, for which the attractive and repulsive regimes are
reversed. It is convenient to specify the relative strength
of the dipole-dipole interaction to the van der Waals in-
teraction via the parameter εdd = Cdd/3g. By means of
Feshbach resonances to tune g [61], as well as the above
mentioned method of generating Cdd < 0, it is experi-
mentally possible to access systems over the full range
−∞ < εdd < ∞, with negative or positive g or Cdd.

The quantum state of the dipolar condensate is de-
scribed by its mean-ﬁeld wavefunction Ψ(r, t); the con-
densate density distribution follows as n(r) = |Ψ(r, t)|2.
In the limit of zero temperature, the wavefunction obeys

The external potential V (r) which conﬁnes the cloud can
in general take many forms, but we assume it to be a
harmonic waveguide given by V (r) = mω2⊥r2⊥/2, where

r⊥ = (cid:112)x2 + y2 deﬁnes the radial coordinate, and the

transverse trapping frequency is ω⊥. We neglect any ax-
ial conﬁnement since the exact soliton solutions we seek
exist only for axially uniform systems. It is worth noting
that such axially-uniform waveguides are accessible ex-
perimentally [12]. Meanwhile, Φdd(r, t) is the non-local
mean-ﬁeld potential generated by the dipoles

Φ(r, t) =

dr(cid:48)Udd(r − r(cid:48))n(r(cid:48), t).

(cid:90)

In this work we consider a quasi-one-dimensional dipo-
lar condensate [55], under which the 3D GPE can
be reduced to an eﬀective 1D equation. The trans-
verse harmonic trapping is suﬃciently tight (¯hω⊥ (cid:29)

µ, where µ is the chemical potential of the three-
dimensional system) that no transverse degrees of free-
dom are excited. The wavefunction is taken to follow
the ansatz Ψ(r, t) = ψ⊥(r⊥)ψ(z, t), where ψ⊥(r⊥) =
(l⊥
transverse harmonic length scale. Such a state consti-
tutes a single mode approximation (SMA) for the axial
dynamics of the condensate.
Inserting this ansatz into
the 3D GPE (4) and integrating out the transverse (x-y)
dimensions leads to the eﬀective 1D dipolar GPE

The term in square brackets in Eq. (8) gives a non-local

tribution to the mean-ﬁeld interactions. The strength
and orientation of the dipole-dipole interaction is cap-
tured by U0 = Cdd(1 + 3 cos 2θ)/32πl3⊥. It is also useful
to know the energy of the condensate, which is given by

The three terms here represent kinetic energy, interaction
energy due to vdWs interactions and interaction energy
due to dipolar interactions.

From now on our analysis of dipolar dark solitons will
be based on the eﬀective 1D dipolar GPE (6). Our results
will be presented in terms of the natural quantities of
the homogeneous (soliton-free) condensate. Taking n0 as
the uniform density, the chemical potential (the energy
(6)) follows as µ0 = n0g/(2πl2⊥) +
eigenvalue of Eq.
Φ0. Here the ﬁrst term represents the van der Waals
contribution, and Φ0 = −Cddn0[1 + 3 cos 2θ]/24πl2⊥ is
the dipolar contribution. The natural units of length and
speed are the dipolar healing length, ξ = ¯h/
mµ0, and

the speed of sound, c =(cid:112)µ0/m. A time unit follows as

√

τ = ξ/c. To parameterize the cross-over from three to one
dimension we deﬁne σ = l⊥/ξ; the quasi-one-dimensional
limit is valid for σ <∼ 1 [63].

III. STABILITY OF THE HOMOGENEOUS

SYSTEM

Dark solitons are excitations of a background conden-
sate, and so the stability of these states is heavily inﬂu-

3

enced by that of the background condensate. Here we
perform an analysis of the stability of the homogeneous
quasi-1D dipolar condensate. This is a generalization of
the results of Refs. [44, 57] which only considered dipoles
polarized along the long axis. Although strictly speaking
the dark soliton state will possess a diﬀerent excitation
spectrum to that calculated in this section, we will see
that this simple analysis agrees remarkably well with the
position of the instabilities of the dark soliton solutions
to Eq. (6).

The stability of the condensate can be deduced from
the fate of small perturbations whose energies are given
by the Bogoliubov excitation spectrum. For a homoge-
neous system, the Bogoliubov spectrum depends on the
momentum (Fourier) space version of Eq. (8). However,
rather than directly transforming Eq. (8), we can pro-
ceed more easily by returning to the original 3D dipolar
interaction given in Eq. (2) and transform it into Fourier
space by using the useful identity [70]

The quantity ˆkj appearing in Eq. (11) is the jth compo-

results together with the Fourier representation of the
delta function, the Fourier transform of Eq. (2) can then

The dimensional reduction to 1D can be performed di-
rectly in Fourier space in an analogous way to the real-
space reduction, again by assuming a harmonic ground
state in the transverse directions. This yields the mo-
mentum space equivalent of Eq. (8) [44]

integral. The total one-dimensional pseudo-potential, in-
cluding van der Waals and dipolar contributions, is then
Utot(kz) = g/(2πl2⊥) + U1D(kz). Both Eq. (8) and (13)
can be split into a non-local and local contribution; the
former gives a contribution to the total contact interac-
tions while the latter forms the important long-ranged
part of the dipolar interaction. We note that in general
the scattering length, and hence g, can be modiﬁed both
by the dipolar interactions and conﬁnement induced reso-
nances (due to tight 1D trapping) and so may not take on

their 3D dipole-free values [57]. Nevertheless, the general
form of this pseudo-potential is expected to hold.

With the above results in hand, the Bogoliubov excita-
tion spectrum for perturbations of momentum ¯hkz from
the background can be written as

δψ(z, t)=u(kz)e−i(kzz−Ekt/¯h)+v∗(kz)ei(kzz−E∗

k t/¯h) (15)

that constitute small amplitude ﬂuctuations about the
stationary condensate.

Figure 2 illustrates the dispersion relation correspond-
ing to Eq. (14). For certain parameters, the dispersion
relation has the same structure as for the non-dipolar
case (dot-dashed blue line): for low k it is linear in k (the
phonon regime), changing to a quadratic form at higher
k (the free-particle regime). The system is prone to a
phonon (long wavelength kz → 0) instability.
In non-
dipolar homogeneous condensates, this arises when the
mean-ﬁeld van der Waals interactions become attractive,
g < 0. Examining the small kz behavior of the dispersion
Ek = ¯hωk relation given by Eq. (14) yields

where cs is the speed of sound associated with this long-
wavelength regime. We identify the phonon instability as
occurring when the bracketed term (which corresponds
to the homogeneous chemical potential µ0) is less than
zero. This leads to imaginary frequencies, signifying the
unstable exponential growth of long-wavelength pertur-
bations.

In other parameter regimes, the dipoles can change the
form of the dispersion relation at intermediate k. In cer-
tain instances, it causes a ﬂattening oﬀ of the dispersion
spectrum, as shown in Fig. 2 (dashed black line), while in
more extreme cases a minima can form in the dispersion
relation at ﬁnite momentum, i.e. the roton. An example
is shown in Fig. 2 (solid red line), with a pronounced dip
appearing at kz ∼ ξ−1. The associated local maximum in
the dispersion relation is termed the maxon. If the roton
minimum touches the zero-energy axis then the conden-
sate undergoes the roton instability. The roton is pre-
dominantly driven by transverse (oﬀ-axis) eﬀects of the
dipole-dipole interaction, and becomes less pronounced
in the one-dimensional limit (σ → 0) [37].

We identify the roton instability as follows. The ex-
pression (14) for E2
k(k) is diﬀerentiated with respect to
kz and set equal to zero so as to identify the station-
ary points (which may correspond to the roton or the
maxon). This is then combined with the dispersion

cally excluded from this result as it can never touch the
zero energy axis). With some manipulation, the critical

These two equations can be solved iteratively to predict
the critical εdd for the roton instability to occur as a
function of θ and σ, as will be presented below.

In Figure 3 we map out stability diagrams in the
(θ, εdd) plane, showing the regions of roton instability
(shaded red) and phonon instability (shaded blue). To
give insight into the role of the transverse condensate
width, three values are considered: (a) σ = 0.2, (b) 0.5
and (c) 1. For each value, we distinguish between the
g > 0 (left column) and g < 0 (right column) cases. The
phonon instability is independent of σ throughout, and
intuitively follows from the play-oﬀ between the van der
Waals interactions and the dipolar contribution to the
contact interactions. Consider, for example, the case of
repulsive vdW interactions. For θ = 0 the dipoles lie

phonon instability (horizontal dashed line). However as
σ is gradually increased, the roton instability undergoes
a change of sign at the critical value σ = σcrit. Figure 4
(c) shows the critical wavelength deﬁned as λc = 2π/kc
plotted as a function of σ. It is seen that λc is monotoni-
cally increasing, and is always greater than σ, indicating
that our one-dimensional analysis is valid. The inset to
Fig. 4 (c) shows a zoomed in portion of this graph cen-
tered around σ = σc, and clearly shows the discontinuity
in λc, indicated by the dashed blue line.

In the absence of dipolar interactions (εdd = 0) and
for repulsive s-wave interactions (g > 0) it is well-known
that the 1D GPE is integrable and supports dark soliton

soliton, c is the sound speed in the condensate, and the
dark soliton’s centre of mass is initially placed at the
origin. The family of solitons commonly feature a density
depression and a phase slip, with the depression density,
nd and total phase slip S related to the soliton speed, v,

via v/c =(cid:112)1 − (nd/n0) = cos(S/2). The v = 0 “black”

soliton (z = 0) has zero density at its centre and a π
phase slip, while the v = c soliton is indistinguishable
from the background density. Since dark solitons deplete
the density proﬁle, they are analogous to particles with
negative mass [66].

B. Numerical Approach to the Dipolar Dark

Soliton Solutions

A ﬁnite-speed dark soliton is a time-dependent solu-
tion of the GPE in the laboratory frame, but a time-
independent solution in the co-moving frame. The
co-moving wavefunction, denoted ψ, corresponds to a
Galilean transformation of the lab-frame wavefunction
according to

ψ(z, t).

(20)

From this and the 1D dipolar GPE (6) we form the
moving-frame GPE i¯h∂tΨ = ( ˆH + v ˆpz)ψ, where ˆH is
(6) and
the lab-frame Hamiltonian appearing in Eq.
ˆpz = −i¯h∂z is the momentum operator in the z-direction.
Stationary solutions of this equation are of the form
ψ(z, t) = φ(z)e−iµt/¯h, where µ is the chemical poten-
tial. This leads to the time-independent form of the 1D
moving-frame dipolar GPE, ( ˆH + v ˆpz)φ = µφ.

The blue (red) bands represent regions of phonon (roton) in-
stability, while white regions are stable. The magic angle,
θm (cid:39) 54◦ is indicated in dashed black. Note that dipolar in-
teractions can act to either destabilize or stablize the BEC.
The latter situation occurs when g < 0 but the net dipolar
interactions are repulsive.

in the attractive end-to-end conﬁguration, and when the
dipoles are suﬃciently strong (εdd > 1) they can over-
whelm the repulsive vdW interactions, inducing phonon
instability. Conversely, for θ = π/2 the dipoles are side-
by-side; conventionally this is a repulsive conﬁguration,
but in the regime of anti-dipoles (Cdd < 0) this conﬁgu-
ration is attractive, and induces phonon instability when
the anti-dipoles are suﬃciently strong (εdd < −2).

The regions of roton instability are sensitive to σ. For
low σ (cases (a) and (b) in Figure 3), the roton instabil-
ity arises only for attractive vdWs interactions (g < 0).
Deep in the 1D regime (case (a)) the roton instability
arises only in a narrow band in the (θ, εdd) plane; as σ
is increased this band expands (case (b)). However once
a critical value (σcrit ∼ 0.8) is exceeded, as per row (c),
the roton instability shifts instead to appearing only for
repulsive vdW interactions (g > 0). The value of σcrit
does not depend on the angle θ.

To further explore the shift of the roton instability from
g < 0 to g > 0 for increasing σ, Fig. 4 depicts the roton
instability in the (σ, εdd) plane for the extreme polariza-
tion angles, (a) θ = 0 and (b) θ = π/2. In both cases
it is seen that in the quasi-1D limit (σ (cid:28) 1) the roton
instability band narrows, approaching the onset of the

We obtain the soliton solutions by numerically solving
the time-independent GPE in the form, ( ˆH +v ˆpz−µ)φ =
0 using the bi-conjugate gradient method [71] (BCGM).
This technique has been used to obtain moving-frame
vortex solutions in the 2D/3D GPE [67, 72]. It is worth
noting that this approach provides the true dipolar dark
soliton solutions for arbitrary speed.
In contrast, the
approach to ﬁnding soliton solutions based on imaginary
time propagation of the GPE [27] requires a priori knowl-
edge of the soliton phase, and so is only capable of obtain-
ing black (v = 0) soliton solutions, for which the phase
proﬁle is known to be a step function of amplitude π.

The BCGM is an iterative method based on the
Newton-Raphson method for ﬁnding roots of equations.
For a function f (x), Newton’s method uses an initial
guess, x(1), and the following iteration

Numerical implementation was handled in MATLAB

to concatenate the real and imaginary components of f

is then of size 2N × 2N . Taking the non-dipolar soliton
solution, as deﬁned by Eq. (19), as the initial guess for φ
(centered at the origin), we ﬁnd that the BCGM robustly
converges to the required dipolar soliton solution (also
centered at the origin). Note that a diﬀerent choice for
initial guess may lead instead to the homogeneous ground
state.

the corresponding plot for a ﬁnite speed case, v = 0.5c.
The grey bands represent the range of εdd for which no
stable condensate exists, consistent with the correspond-
ing stability diagrams presented in row (a) of Fig. 3.
Away from the unstable region, the density proﬁles re-
semble the tanh2-density of the conventional dark soli-
tons, with a width of the order of the healing length ξ
(which should be noted is itself a function of εdd and θ).
Near to the phonon instability (solid lines) the density
proﬁle diverges in width; this is due to a cancellation be-
tween the local interactions arising from the explicit van
der Waals interactions and the implicit local contribu-
tion to the DDIs, with a similar eﬀect seen for vortices
in 2D dipolar condensates [58]. Meanwhile, as the roton
instability (dashed lines) is approached, density ripples
form symmetrically around the soliton, decaying as they
recede from the core. For the cases shown in Fig. 5, the
ripples can rise to twice the background density with the
most prominent parts being the two dominant lobes ei-
ther side of the dark soliton (see also Fig. 6). They arise
due to the soliton state mixing with the roton, an eﬀect
akin to that predicted for vortices in 2D [52, 58, 68]. The
ripples can be understood from an energetic point of view
by noticing that they occur when the dipolar interactions
are repulsive along the axial direction meaning that the
system can lower its energy by placing more dipoles near
to the empty core. The repulsive dipolar interaction due
to the lobes in turn causes a density reduction next to
them, then another peak, and so on. The ripples are thus
a direct eﬀect of the long range nature of the dipolar in-
teractions. Despite the density modulations, the soliton
depth still follows the relation nd/n0 = 1 − v2/c2, fa-
miliar from non-dipolar dark solitons. We also ﬁnd that
the density modulations are slightly enhanced for slower
solitons.

As previously discussed in Sec. III, the roton and its
instability is sensitive to the condensate width, σ. To de-
termine the eﬀect of σ on dark solitons, Fig. 6 compares

FIG. 6.
(Color online) Density proﬁles of the black (v =
0) soliton close to the (a) roton instability and the phonon
instability (b), for 3 values of σ. Since the roton instability
shifts with σ, we consider diﬀerent values of εdd in (a): εdd =
1.46 for σ = 0.2, εdd = 2.68 for σ = 0.4, and εdd = 7.60 for
σ = 0.6. In (b) we take εdd = 0.95 throughout.

FIG. 5. (Color online) Density proﬁles n(z) for (a) v = 0 and
θ = 0, (b) v = 0 and θ = π/2, (c) v = 0.5c and θ = 0 and
(d) v = 0.5c and θ = π/2, as a function of εdd with σ = 0.2.
The band (grey) of instability is bounded by the onset of the
roton (dashed) and phonon (solid) instabilities. Note that
either side of this unstable band, the system is stable for only
g > 0 or g < 0, as indicated.

The absolute value of the phase is arbitrary, and to aid
convergence we ﬁx the value of the phase at one end of
the grid. The grid spacing ∆z is typically 0.1ξ. Away
from the phonon/roton instabilities, we employ a box of
typical length 100ξ. However, close to these instabilities,
box sizes of up to 1600ξ were required to ensure good
approximation to the inﬁnite limit (that is, for the mean-
ﬁeld dipolar potential to reach its homogeneous value at
the boundaries). The solutions were deemed converged
when the relative residual, calculated as ||Jδφ + f||/||f||,
had fallen below an arbitrary tolerance of 10−5.
The above numerical method is akin to solving the
equation Jδφ = −f for δφ, then setting φ(p+1) = φ(p) +
δφ at each step p. The advantage of using the BCGM
is that we only require knowledge of the transpose of
the Jacobian, which is numerically faster to obtain than
matrix inversion.

C. Dipolar Dark Soliton Solutions

We now set about exploring the dipolar dark soliton so-
lutions across the important parameters of soliton speed
v, polarization angle θ, dipolar strength εdd, and con-
densate width σ. Figure 5(a,b) plots the spatial density
proﬁle n(z) of the black (v = 0) soliton solutions as a
function of εdd, for the extreme polarization angles of
(a) θ = 0 and (b) θ = π/2. The former represents the
typical behavior for all solutions in the range θ < θm,
and the latter shows the converse. Figure 5(c,d) shows

bility and (b) phonon instability, for diﬀerent values of
σ. Note that we maintain σ < 1 throughout so to sat-
isfy the governing criteria for a quasi-1D condensate (see
Section II). As σ increases the system becomes less “1D”
in nature and the eﬀects of dipolar interactions become
more pronounced. At the roton instability, the density
ripples grow rapidly with σ, becoming as large as 15n0
for σ = 0.6 (dotted black line). The lengthscale of the
ripples also increases with σ; this is consistent with the
earlier homogeneous analysis, which showed the roton
wavelength to increase with σ (Fig. 4 (c)). Meanwhile,
at the phonon instability the soliton has a funnel shaped
density proﬁle, which widens with σ. Having explored
the dependency of σ we will employ σ = 0.2 for the re-
mainder of our work (the relevant homogeneous stability
diagrams being shown in row (a) of Fig. 3).

D.

Integrals of Motion

The family of non-dipolar dark solitons [Eq. (19)] pos-
sess an inﬁnite number of integrals of motion (viz. con-
served quantities). The ﬁrst three of these have a clear
physical meaning: the soliton normalization, momentum,
and energy [59, 65]. In order to calculate ﬁnite values for
each of these quantities, we compute their renormalized
versions, that is, the diﬀerence between the quantity in
the presence and absence of the soliton.
In this sub-
section we generalize these quantities for dipolar dark
solitons and explore their dependence on the dipolar pa-
rameters.

The renormalized norm and momentum of the dark

soliton are deﬁned as

where n0 is the homogeneous background density. The
renormalized energy must explicitly include the contri-
bution from the dipoles. To calculate this we follow
a similar approach to Ref.
[60]. According to Eq.
(9) the energy of a homogeneous system of length L is
0/4πl2⊥ + Φ0n0/2)L, where Φ0 is the homo-
E0 = (gn2
geneous dipolar potential.
In order to make a direct
comparison between a homogeneous system and a system
containing a soliton the quantity E−µN must be consid-
ered, so as to account for the diﬀerent particle number N
between the two systems. Thus the renormalized soliton
energy can be written as

We evaluate the norm, momentum and energy of the
dipolar solitons numerically according to Eqs. (26-28).
In the left rows of Fig. 7 (a-c) these conserved quan-
tities are plotted as a function of the soliton speed for
three values of εdd, with the polarization angle ﬁxed to
θ = 0. Note that these three values of εdd correspond
to 168Er parameters (εdd = 0.4) and near to the phonon
(εdd = 0.8) and roton instabilities (εdd = 5). Through-
out, the dipolar results show the same qualitative struc-
ture as the non-dipolar result (solid black line), but can
be quite diﬀerent quantitatively. The soliton norm Nsol
[Fig. 7 (a), left] decreases monotonically with speed due
to the reduction in the soliton depth for larger speeds,
becoming zero for v = c when the soliton is indistin-
guishable from the background. The soliton momentum
Psol [Fig. 7 (b), left] also decreases monotonically with
v, due to the decreasing norm and decreasing phase gra-
dient (the phase gradient determines the local ﬂuid ve-
locity according to u(z) = (¯h/m)∂zS(z), where S(z) is
the phase proﬁle) across the soliton. It has a universal
value for v = 0 of Psol = π¯hn0 due to the π-phase-step
proﬁle of the v = 0 solitons. The momentum becomes
zero for v = c when the norm and phase gradient reach
zero. The dipoles have the greatest eﬀect on Psol for
intermediate velocties. Finally, the soliton energy Esol
[Fig. 7 (c), left] also decreases with v, associated with
the decreasing interaction energy as the soliton gets in-
creasingly shallow and the decreasing kinetic energy due
to the reduced density and phase gradients, and at v = c
Esol = 0.

Close to the phonon instability (blue dashed lines) the
integrals of motion tend to be larger than the non-dipolar
case. This can be related to the wide funnel-shaped pro-
ﬁle which develops close to this instability. This vastly
increases the eﬀective volume of the soliton core, i.e. the
norm. This in turn raises the momentum and energy
(in the latter case, due primarily to the increased inter-
action energy associated with the larger density deple-
tion). The momentum and energy are also modiﬁed by
density gradients. Meanwhile, close to the roton instabil-
ity (purple dot-dashed line) the integrals of motion tend

9
with only the scale changing. At the magic angle, θm ≈
0.3π, the integrals equal the non-dipolar result, due to the
vanishing of the dipolar potential here. Note that the gap
in the curve for εdd = 5 is due to the absence of stable
solutions here, consistent with the stability diagram in
Fig. 3 (a).

The eﬀective mass of the soliton, deﬁned as m(cid:63) =
∂Psol/∂v, is shown in Fig. 7 (d). The eﬀective mass is
negative throughout, tending towards zero eﬀective mass
when v = c, as expected. For most cases the eﬀective
mass increases monotonically with v. However, close to
phonon instability it has a unusual form, being approxi-
mately constant for v/c <∼ 0.4 and decreasing to a local
mininum at v/c ≈ 0.75 m(cid:63)/m.

V. DYNAMICS OF DIPOLAR DARK SOLITONS

In this section we explore the rudimentary dynamics of
the dipolar dark solitons. In particular we seek to estab-
lish their soliton-like nature. We will approach this by
reference to the general deﬁnition of a soliton given by
Johnson and Drazin [19], which is of three key properties:
(i) permanent form, (ii) localized within a region of space,
and (iii) emergence from collisions unchanged, barring a
phase shift. The results presented here are based on nu-
merical propagation of the 1D (lab-frame) dipolar GPE
using the Crank-Nicolson method, using a suitable ini-
tial condition featuring soliton solutions obtained from
the BCGM method.

A. Propagation

Figure 8 shows the evolution of a v = 0.5c dipolar
dark soliton (with ﬁxed θ = 0) for three values of εdd:
0.4 (corresponding to 168Er), 0.8 (close to the phonon
instability) and 5 (close to the roton instability). Insets
show the density and phase proﬁles across the soliton.
For all three cases, the soliton maintains a permanent
and localized form, with no radiative losses. It also un-
dergoes centre-of-mass translation at the expected speed.
As such, these states satisfy the soliton criteria (i) and
(ii) above.
It is also worth observing the phase proﬁle
across the soliton. For εdd = 0.4 [Fig. 8(a)], the phase
proﬁle is practically identical to that of the non-dipolar
dark soliton, with a tanh-shaped step which relaxes to
the asymptotic value over a short lengthscale of the or-
der of the healing length. Close to the instabilities, the
phase relaxes over a much larger lengthscale, of around
∼ 50ξ close to the phonon instability [Fig. 8(b)] and
around 400ξ close to the roton instability [Fig. 8(c)]. In
all cases the total asymptotic phase slip is the same as
for the non-dipolar soliton (this is not directly evident
from the inset in (c) due to the limited length range of
this plot). Close to the instabilities the phase proﬁle also
features distinctive prominences. At the phonon insta-
bility these are broad, while at the roton instability they

to be smaller. The density ripples which form here act
to reduce the eﬀective volume of the soliton core, which
reduces the momentum and energy relative to the non-
dipolar case.

Finally, in the right rows of Fig. 7 (a-c) the conserved
quantities are plotted as a function of the polarization
angle for the three values of εdd, while keeping the soliton
speed ﬁxed (v = 0.5c). The non-dipolar result is constant
in each plot. What is particularly prominent is that the
θ dependence is the same for all 3 integrals of motion,

are of order of the roton length scale.

B. Collisions

In non-dipolar systems the interaction between multi-
ple dark solitons has been experimentally observed and
In a symmetric collision
theoretically studied [62, 69].
for solitons satisfying 0 < v/c < 1
2 the s-wave interac-
tions create a repulsive force causing the solitons to ap-
pear to reﬂect at short distance. For velocities satisfying
1

2 ≤ v/c < 1 the solitons appear to pass through each

other. In both cases the outgoing solitons are unchanged
from the incoming form, barring a phase shift.
In the
presence of dipolar interactions this behavior is modi-
ﬁed [27, 28]. In Ref. [28] the eﬀect of polarization angle
on the collisions was explored, revealing an additional
non-local repulsion or attraction on the soliton-soliton
interaction due to the dipolar interactions. The latter
case, in combination with the conventional short-range
repulsion, was shown to support bound states. Here we
explore the soliton collisions further, exploring the role
of the experimentally-tunable interaction parameter εdd
and the soliton speed. We investigate the eﬀect of the
dipolar contribution near to the instabilities, for a system
comprised of 168Er atoms [36], with polarization θ = 0.
Figure 9 presents a series of dark soliton collisions for
(left column) slow incoming solitons (v = ±0.1c) and
(right column) faster solitons (v = ±0.5c), and for vari-
ous values of εdd. For comparison, the non-dipolar col-
lisions are also shown (row (a)); these conﬁrm the ap-
parent bouncing for low collisional speeds and apparent
transmission for higher speeds. For relatively weak dipo-
lar interactions (row (b), εdd = 0.4) the soliton collisions
are virtually indistinguishable from the non-dipolar case,
with a short-range-dominated interaction and the soli-
tons emerging unscathed.

For stronger dipolar interactions (row (c), εdd = 0.8),
the dipolar interactions have a noticeable eﬀect on the
soliton interactions, particularly at low speeds. Here the
solitons appear to bounce at a considerably greater sep-

aration than the non-dipolar case. This eﬀect can be
directly related to the dipolar interactions. Since θ = 0
and Cdd > 0 for this case, the dipoles lie end-to-end and
attract each other. However, the dark soliton is a region
of depleted dipoles, and can be interpreted as a positive
density of anti-dipoles [28, 73] which repel each other.
This repulsive contribution to the dark soliton interac-
tion will arise whenever the dipoles are net repulsive, i.e.
when Cdd > 0 with θ < θm or when Cdd < 0 with θ > θm.
The repulsive nature of the collision becomes washed out
at higher incoming speeds (row (c), right panel). While
the soliton collision is stable at low speed (left panel), at
high speed the collision is inelastic, with energy lost from
the solitons via the emission of sound waves (visible as
bands propagating away from the collision at the speed
of sound).

The case of εdd = 5 (row (d)) instead has Cdd < 0,
i.e. repulsive dipoles. This in turn leads to an attractive
contribution to the soliton interaction, and this is clearly
observed in the corresponding soliton collisions. Note the
distinctive sharp “pinching” of the solitons during their
collision at low speed. More generally, this attractive
contribution arises whenever the dipolar interactions are
net attractive, i.e. when Cdd < 0 with θ < θm or when
Cdd > 0 with θ > θm. Here, for both low and higher in-
coming speeds, the collisions are inelastic through sound
emission.

Note that when the dipoles are polarized at the magic
angle θm the dynamics are equivalent to the non-dipolar
case [28].

Away from the phonon and roton instabilities, the soli-
tons collide elastically, and emerge unscathed from the
collision. This satisﬁes the third soliton criteria out-
lined above. However, close to the instabilities, the col-
lisions become dissipative, with sound being radiated
away. This is particularly prevalent for higher speed col-
lisions. We note, however, that the energy dissipated
into sound waves during a single collision is typically very
small, for example, in the maximally-dissipative case pre-
sented in Fig. 9 ((d), right panel), the energy loss is
∼ 10−3%Esol. As such, even in these dissipative regimes,

VI. CONCLUSIONS

11

In this work the family of dark solitons supported in a
quasi-one-dimensional dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate
were studied. A bi-conjugate gradient method was imple-
mented to numerically obtain these non-trivial solitons
as stationary solutions in the moving frame, as a func-
tion of the dipole-dipole interaction strength (εdd), the
polarization angle θ and the soliton speed. The phonon
and roton instabilities of the system play a key role in
modifying the density and phase proﬁles of the solitons,
which can deviate signiﬁcantly from the non-dipolar form
in these regimes. The dipolar dark solitons were charac-
terized in terms of their integrals of motion (norm, mo-
mentum and energy). Due to the modiﬁed proﬁles in
the presence of dipolar interactions, these quantities dif-
fer from their non-dipolar form, particularly so close to
the instabilities. The prominent role of the phonon and
roton instabilities in the soliton solutions motivated a
detailed and general analytical treatment of these eﬀects
in the quasi-1D dipolar condensate. This, in particular,
revealed the sensitivity of the roton to the transverse con-
densate size, σ, and the increase in the roton lengthscale
as the dimensionality crossover, σ ∼ 1, is approached.

In isolation, the solitons propagate with unchanged
form throughout the parameter space. Away from the
instabilities their collisions are elastic, but become dis-
sipative via emission of sound waves close to the insta-
bilities. Thus, close to the instabilities these structures
deviate from solitons in a strict sense, although it should
be noted that the energy dissipated in a single collision
is very small.

FIG. 9. (Color online) Collisions of two dark solitons at low
speed (v = ±0.1c, left panels) and higher speed (v = ±0.5c,
right panels) for (a) εdd = 0, (b) εdd = 0.4, (c) εdd = 0.8 and
(d) εdd = 5. The polarization angle is taken to be θ = 0.

these structures closely approximate true solitons.
