The Standard Model predicts that, in addition to a proton, an electron, and an antineutrino, a
continuous spectrum of photons is emitted in the β decay of the free neutron. We report on the
RDK II experiment which measured the photon spectrum using two diﬀerent detector arrays. An
annular array of bismuth germanium oxide scintillators detected photons from 14 keV to 782 keV.
The spectral shape was consistent with theory, and we determined a branching ratio of 0.00335 ±
0.00005 [stat] ± 0.00015 [syst]. A second detector array of large area avalanche photodiodes directly
detected photons from 0.4 keV to 14 keV. For this array, the spectral shape was consistent with
theory, and the branching ratio was determined to be 0.00582 ± 0.00023 [stat] ± 0.00062 [syst]. We
report the ﬁrst precision test of the shape of the photon energy spectrum from neutron radiative
decay and a substantially improved determination of the branching ratio over a broad range of
photon energies.

In the six decades since the ﬁrst measurement of the
neutron lifetime, the study of neutron beta decay has pro-
vided increasingly precise tests of the Standard Model
and important input to cosmology and other areas of
physics [1–3]. Precision measurements of neutron ob-
servables, such as the lifetime [4, 5] and the spin-electron
asymmetry coeﬃcient [5–7], allow for comparisons with
theory with a precision below 1%. The Standard Model
predicts that the decay of the free neutron can produce
one or more detectable radiative photons in addition to
a proton, an electron, and an antineutrino. Calculated
radiative corrections of approximately 4% are employed
in relating the measured lifetime to weak interaction pa-
rameters [8]. Given the precision of neutron beta-decay
measurements, it is important to perform direct precision
measurements of its radiative decay mode.

Here we present the results of the RDK II experiment,
which includes the ﬁrst precision test of the shape of the
photon energy spectrum and a substantially improved
determination of the branching ratio. This demonstrates
the feasibility of precise measurements of the neutron’s
radiative decay mode that can probe additional physics.
For example, a measurement of the photons’ circular po-
larization could reveal information about the Dirac struc-
ture of the weak current [9–11] and a possible source
of time-reversal violation would be apparent in a triple-

product correlation between the antineutrino, electron,
and photon [12, 13]. Increased precision would allow a
test of a heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory calcu-
lation [10].

In contrast with the long history of most neutron beta-
decay measurements, experimental studies of neutron ra-
diative beta decay are relatively recent. An experiment
in 2002 placed a limit on the branching ratio for this pro-
cess [14], and in 2006 the RDK I collaboration reported
the ﬁrst deﬁnitive observation of radiative decay [15, 16].
The RDK II experiment improved upon its predecessor
by reducing statistical uncertainties through the use of
additional photon detectors, improving the understand-
ing of systematic uncertainties through detailed energy
response studies of the detectors, and signiﬁcantly ex-
tending the detectable photon energy range to between
0.4 keV and the 782 keV photon energy endpoint. Fur-
ther information on the RDK II apparatus can be found
in other references by the collaboration [16–19].

Radiative photons from neutron decay originate from
either electron, proton, or vertex bremsstrahlung. Elec-
tron bremsstrahlung dominates while the recoil order
terms, including vertex bremsstrahlung, contribute less
than 1% to the branching ratio [10]. We performed our
own numerical calculations using leading order QED [11]
without accounting for ﬁnite-nucleon-size eﬀects. Our

calculations agree with branching ratios from other pub-
lished calculations [9, 10, 20] to within 1%. We used
(880.3 ± 1.1) s for the neutron lifetime [5] and in-
cluded a Coulomb correction of 3% to the radiative par-
tial decay rate, which was not present in prior calcula-
tions [21, 22]. Other next-to-leading order eﬀects were
not included [22].

The experiment operated at the NG-6 fundamental
physics end-station at the Center for Neutron Research
(NCNR) at the National Institute of Standards and Tech-
nology (NIST) [23]. The reactor-produced cold neutron
beam was guided to the experiment as in RDK I [16],
but with increased neutron collimation to decrease back-
grounds and systematic uncertainties in decay locations.
Using a calibrated 6Li-foil neutron ﬂux monitor [24, 25]
mounted downstream of the detection region, the typical
neutron rate was determined to be 1.1×108 per second.
The neutron beam passed through a strong magnetic
ﬁeld produced by a set of superconducting solenoids that
were used to guide charged decay products to a detector.
This detection method has been used in several experi-
ments measuring neutron decay parameters [15, 26–28].
The detection region (see Fig. 1 (a)) was deﬁned by a 9.5
degree bend in the magnetic ﬁeld and a ring of aluminum
maintained at +1400 V that served as an electrostatic
mirror. The mirror created an +800 V barrier at the
center of the beam to protons. The magnetic ﬁeld varied
from 3.3 T to 4.6 T over the 34 cm distance between the
bend and mirror.

Neutrons which decayed between the mirror and the
bend produced electrons and protons capable of being
detected by the experiment. The electrons and protons
followed adiabatic helical orbits about the ﬁeld lines with
maximum cyclotron radii of approximately 1 mm. Elec-
trons emitted in the downstream direction (see Fig. 1
(a)) typically escaped the active detection region unde-
tected because their kinetic energies, on the order of hun-
dreds of keV each, were likely suﬃcient to overcome the
electrostatic mirror. Electrons emitted in the upstream
direction followed the magnetic ﬁeld to a 1 mm or 1.5 mm
thick, 600 mm2 silicon surface barrier detector (SBD) in
a time on the order of nanoseconds. Protons were de-
tected if emitted in either direction because the electro-
static mirror was suﬃcient to reﬂect all of them. The
protons traveled to the SBD in a time on the order of
microseconds. The SBD was held at a −25 kV potential
to accelerate protons through the gold layer on its front
face. The SBD was calibrated by determining the elec-
tron endpoint energy of neutron decay from a functional
ﬁt, and its linearity was veriﬁed with radioactive source
measurements.

Two separate photon detector arrays surrounded the
neutron beam in the active region. The BGO detector
array consisted of twelve 1.2 cm x 1.2 cm x 20 cm bis-
muth germanium oxide (BGO) scintillator crystals opti-
cally coupled to avalanche photodiodes (APDs) [17]. The

eled from left to right through the active region deﬁned by
the ﬁelds (dashed lines) created by the solenoids (gold) and

the ﬁeld lines to the SBD (light blue). Radiative photons are
detected by twelve BGO crystals (green) and three large area
APDs.
(b) Detection probability in independent arbitrary units
(A.U.) for electron-proton (ep) and electron-proton-photon
(epγ) detection coincidence for either the BGO or direct APD
detectors. This plot is approximately aligned with the dia-
gram above.

detection range of the BGO detectors was between ap-
proximately 10 keV to 1000 keV. The cryogenic environ-
ment (80 K) inside the detector served to both increase
the BGO scintillators’ light output and the APDs’ gain
while decreasing the APDs’ noise. The twelve detectors
were, for the most part, shielded from bremsstrahlung
associated with particles striking the SBD. A small cor-
rection and uncertainty for this process was determined
by simulation (see Table I).

The typical BGO detector energy resolution was 10%
(full width at half maximum) at 662 keV and 30% at
60 keV [17]. When the neutron beam shutter was open,
a 511 keV electron-positron annihilation peak was ob-
served in the BGO photon background spectrum and was
used for calibration, i.e. photon pulse height channel 511
corresponds to 511 keV. The nonproportionality of light
output versus photon energy deposited in BGO crystals is
signiﬁcant at lower energies and caused the BGO lower
limit at photon pulse height channel 10 to be centered
at 14.1 keV of photon energy deposited. This nonpro-
portionality was measured in a separate study [29] and
parameterized by a consensus model in combination with
existing literature [30–34]. This model was then incorpo-
rated into the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation.

BGO nonproportionality was not accounted for in the
RDK I experiment.
In addition, the theoretical value
quoted in Refs. [15, 16] did not include a Coulomb cor-

rection to the outgoing decay electron [21, 22]; this should
be the largest eﬀect at order α2 where α is the ﬁne struc-
ture constant. Incorporating both of these changes would
not alter the value of the previously measured branching
ratio, 0.00309 ± 0.00032, but would adjust the RDK I
energy range to 19 keV – 313 keV instead of 15 keV –
340 keV and result in a corrected theoretical branching
ratio of 0.00259.

The APD array consisted of three 2.8 cm x 2.8 cm
APDs that directly detected 0.4 keV to 14 keV photons
without a scintillator [17]. The detection range of the
APD detectors was between approximately 0.3 keV to
20 keV. The APDs were oriented with their bias ﬁeld par-
allel to the magnetic ﬁeld due to previously reported is-
sues with X-ray detection if the APDs were oriented with
their bias ﬁeld perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld at low
temperature [35]. During data taking, the APDs were ex-
posed to a 55Fe radioactive source mounted near the de-
tectors, which produced 5.9 keV photons for calibration.
Oﬄine studies at synchrotron sources were performed to
explore the APDs’ complex energy response, which is due
to reduced charge collection eﬃciency for photons that
are absorbed in the front 1 µm of the APD [36]. Mod-
els of the charge collection eﬃciency of the APDs’ doped
layers of Si were created and then incorporated into the
MC simulation of the detectors.

Data recording [17, 18] was triggered by two sin-
gle channel analyzers and a time-to-amplitude converter
(TAC). An SBD signal equivalent to > 50 keV (an elec-
tron) followed by a signal equivalent to > 7 keV (an ac-
celerated proton), with both falling within the 25 µs time
range of the TAC, initiated data recording to disk from
the SBD and both photon detector arrays. The wave-
forms of all signals were recorded from 25 µs before to
57 µs after the electron signal with 2048 channel resolu-
tion.

The RDK II experiment operated on the neutron beam
line from December 2008 until November 2009. The ﬁnal
data set consisted of 22 million electron-proton (ep) de-
tections, for which about 20,000 and 800 radiative pho-
tons were detected in coincidence (epγ) with the BGO
and APD detectors, respectively. Some data runs were
eliminated from the analysis typically for one of three
reasons: their small size, a loss of SBD detector gain,
or an anomalous structure in the proton time-of-ﬂight
spectrum that was not consistent with simulation. The
waveform data were analyzed and the waveforms from
the SBD and the photon detectors were ﬁt to functional
forms to extract their pulse heights. For each individual
photon detector, background was determined by using
the pre-peak and post-peak photon backgrounds found
in the electron-photon timing spectrum (see Fig. 2).

To account for the experiment’s complex detection eﬃ-
ciency proﬁle (see Figure 1 (b)), a MC simulation was cre-
ated. In the simulation, initial momenta and positions for
the neutron decay products were created randomly using

FIG. 2. The detected timing spectrum for the diﬀerence be-
tween electron and photon detection in coincidence with a de-
layed proton. The central peak arises from radiative photons
which are detected nearly simultaneously with the electrons
while the ﬂat regions represent sources of constant, uncorre-
lated photon background. The response of the APD detectors
was signiﬁcantly faster than the BGO detectors and resulted
in a sharper timing peak. Only the background and signal
windows for the BGO detectors are shown.

a leading order QED event generator [11] and a simula-
tion of the neutron beam proﬁle. The protons, electrons,
and photons were then transported by a Runge-Kutta
algorithm in a model of the detection region’s geometry
with Geant4.9.6.p02 [19, 37]. Magnetic and electric
ﬁelds were interpolated from simulated ﬁeld maps of the
apparatus. Geant4.9.6.p02 was also used to determine
the energy deposited in the detectors, including any sec-
ondary radiation or backscattering produced. Models of
detector energy response and energy resolution were also
incorporated. Results from the simulations were consis-
tent with experimental timing and energy spectra of the
protons and electrons.

A ratio was formed for both the experimental data
and the simulated data by dividing the detected rate of
electron, proton, and photon coincidences repγ by the de-
tected rate of electron and proton coincidences rep. This
ratio of rates R = repγ /rep serves two purposes: it is inde-
pendent of the neutron rate and many systematic uncer-
tainties associated with the electron and proton detection
cancel. The ratio for the integrated experimental data
RExp and for the integrated simulated data RSim can be
then compared. Because RSim is dependent on the theo-
retical branching ratio BTheory, an experimental branch-
ing ratio can be extracted BExp = BTheoryRExp/RSim.

The corrections and relative standard uncertainties
of systematic eﬀects associated with both the BGO
and APD measurements are given in Table I. The
dominant systematic uncertainties in this experiment
were in the simulation’s model registration, pulse shape
discrimination, and photon detector energy response.

TABLE I. Summary of the systematic corrections and relative
standard uncertainties in the measured branching ratio. Note
that “-” indicates that the systematic corrections are less than
0.05% in magnitude but may not be identically zero.

SBD were found in the simulations to produce photons
that could mimic a radiative decay signal in the BGO
detectors, and a -0.8% correction was made. A -1.0%
correction from non-decay coincident events was made
for the BGO detectors.

Model registration refers to the positional accuracy of
the simulation’s model with respect to the apparatus in-
cluding the uncertainty in position of each detector. This
uncertainty resulted primarily from decays originating
from the intersection of the neutron beam with the region
where the magnetic ﬁeld bends towards the SBD (see Fig.
1 (a)), for which a portion of the electrons and protons
would strike the edges of the SBD or would miss the de-
tector entirely. Uncertainties in the position of either the
neutron beam or the SBD therefore aﬀect the simulated
rep. However, as seen in Fig. 1 (b), this region does
not contribute to repγ so the uncertainty fails to cancel
in the ratio RSim. The uncertainty was determined by
varying the position of the beam and SBD in the simu-
lation within the uncertainties of their positions, which
were between 1 mm to 2 mm after thermal contraction.
The pulse shape discrimination uncertainty arose from

the diﬃculty identifying proton pulses which occurred
after some electron pulses that exhibited a slow signal
decay or increased noise between the pulses. This caused
the proton pulse to be superimposed on the tail of these
electron pulses, which made particle identiﬁcation dif-
ﬁcult. The uncertainty was determined by varying an
analysis cut based on the identiﬁcation of these problem-
atic electron pulses.

The BGO energy response uncertainty was calculated
from the observed variability between diﬀerent experi-
mental measurements of nonproportionality in BGO scin-
tillators from the literature and from our crystals [29].
The APD energy response uncertainty was determined
by comparing the variability in energy response models
from diﬀerent synchrotron calibration measurements [36].
The radiative spectra from each BGO detector were
averaged. This averaged spectrum (see Fig. 3(a)) agreed
well with the scaled average spectrum predicted by sim-
ulation and resulted in a chi-squared per degree of free-
dom of 20.2/20 with a p-value of 0.44. The branching
ratio BBGO
Exp was measured to be 0.00335 ± 0.00005 [stat]
± 0.00015 [syst] in the range of 14.1 keV to 782 keV.
For this range, our BBGO
Theory was calculated to be 0.00308.
The values BBGO
Theory agree within 1.7 times the
combined standard uncertainty.

Exp and BBGO

The radiative spectra from each APD detector were
averaged. This averaged spectrum (see Fig. 3(b)) agreed
well with the scaled average spectrum predicted by sim-
ulation and resulted in a chi-squared per degree of free-
dom of 20.1/17 with a p-value of 0.27. The branching
ratio BAPD
Exp was measured to be 0.00582 ± 0.00023 [stat]
± 0.00062 [syst] in the range of 0.4 keV to 14 keV. For
this range, our BAPD
Theory was calculated to be 0.00515. The
values BAPD
Theory agree within 1.0 times the com-
bined standard uncertainty.

Exp and BAPD

In summary, we have reported the ﬁrst precise mea-
surement of the radiative decay of the free neutron span-
ning three orders of magnitude in photon energy using
two diﬀerent detectors. As the precision is limited by sys-
tematic eﬀects, the signiﬁcantly better understanding of
these eﬀects obtained in this experiment provides a path
towards an improved experiment with an uncertainty be-
low 1%. A future experiment could be considered that
eliminates the magnetic ﬁeld, which would allow for par-
ticle tracking and improved detection-volume deﬁnition.
In addition, photon detectors with better proportionality
could be implemented, and improvements in low-energy
proton detection would allow better identiﬁcation of pro-
ton and electron events. Utilizing a higher intensity cold
neutron source should signiﬁcantly improve the ability
to study systematics while maintaining high statistical
precision.
