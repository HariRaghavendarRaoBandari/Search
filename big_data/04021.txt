ALL EXTENSIONS OF C2 BY C2n+1 × C2n+1 ARE GOOD

MALKHAZ BAKURADZE

Abstract. Let Cm be a cyclic group of order m. We prove that if the group G
ﬁts into an extension 1 → C 2
→ G → C2 → 1 then G is good in the sense
of Hopkins-Kuhn-Ravenel, i.e., K(s)∗(BG) is evenly generated by transfers of
Euler classes of complex representations of subgroups of G. Previously this
fact was known for n = 1.

Keywords: Morava K-theory, Transfer homomorphism, Euler class.

1. Introduction and Statements

For a ﬁnite group G let BG denote its classifying space and let K(s)∗(BG) be
the s-th Morava K-theory of BG at prime p = 2 [8]. The coeﬃcient ring K(s)∗(pt)
is the Laurent polynomial ring in one variable, F2[vs, v−1
s ], where F2 is the ﬁeld of
2 elements and deg(vs) = −2(2s − 1). So the coeﬃcient ring is a graded ﬁeld in the
sense that all its graded modules are free, therefore Morava K-theories enjoy the
K¨unneth isomorphism. In particular, we have for the cyclic group C2n+1 that as a
K(s)∗-algebra

K(s)∗(BC2

2n+1 ) = K(s)∗(BC2n+1 ) ⊗ K(s)∗(BC2n+1),

whereas K(s)∗(BC2m ) = K(s)∗[u]/(x2ms

). So that

K(s)∗(BC2

2n+1) = K(s)∗[u, v]/(x2(n+1)s

, y2(n+1)s

),

where u and v are Euler classes of canonical complex linear representations.

The deﬁnition of good groups in the sense [7] is as follows.
a) For a ﬁnite group G, an element x ∈ K(s)∗(BG) is good if it is a transferred
Euler class of a complex subrepresentation of G, i.e., a class of the form T r∗(e(ρ)),
where ρ is a complex representation of a subgroup H < G, e(ρ) ∈ K(s)∗(BH) is
its Euler class (i.e., its top Chern class, this being deﬁned since K(s)∗ is a complex
oriented theory), and T r : BG → BH is the transfer map.

(b) G is called to be good if K(s)∗(BG) is spanned by good elements as a

K(s)∗module.

Recall not all ﬁnite groups are good as it was originally conjectured in [7]. For
odd prime p a counterexample to the even degree was constructed In [10]. The
problem to construct 2-primary counterexample conjecture remains open.

Our main result is as follows

Theorem 1.1. All extensions of C2 by C2

2n+1 is good, where n ≥ 2.

For n = 1 the statement of the theorem was known. See [12], [3] for detailed

discussion and examples.

We will prove Theorem 1.1 for the semidirect products

(1)

(C2n+1 × C2n+1) ⋊ C2.

Then the general case follows because of the fact that the Serre spectral sequence
does not see the diﬀerence between the semidirect products and their non-split
versions.

2. Preliminaries

Recall [6] there exist exactly 17 non-isomorphic groups of order 22n+3, n ≥ 2,
which can be presented as a semidirect product (1). Each such group G is given by
three generators a, b, c and the deﬁning relations

a2n+1

= b2n+1

= c2 = 1, ab = ba, c−1ac = aibj, c−1bc = akbl

for some i, j, k, l ∈ Z2n+1 (Z2m denotes the ring of residue classes modulo 2m). In
particular one has the following

Proposition 2.1. (see [6] ) Let n be an integer such that n ≥ 2. Then there
exist exactly 17 non-isomorphic groups of order 22n+3 which can be presented as a
semidirect product (1). They are:

In [2] we proved

Theorem 2.2. Let Hi and Gi be ﬁnite p-groups, i = 1, . . . , n, such that Hi is good
and Gi ﬁts into an extension 1 → Hi → Gi → Cp → 1.

Let G ﬁt into an extension of the form 1 → H → G → Cp → 1, with diagonal

conjugation action of Cp on H = H1 × · · · × Hn. Denote by

T r∗ = T r∗

̺ : K(s)∗(BH) → K(s)∗(BG),

the transfer homomorphism associated to the p-covering ̺ = ̺(H, G) : BH → BG,

T r∗

i = T r∗

̺i : K(s)∗(BHi) → K(s)∗(BGi),

the transfer homomorphism associated to the p-covering ̺i = ̺(Hi, Gi) : BHi →
BGi, i = 1, . . . , n,

ρi : BG → BGi,

the map, induced by the projection H → Hi on the i-th factor, and let ρ∗ be the
restriction of

(ρ1, · · · , ρn)∗ : K(s)∗(BG1 × · · · × BGn) → K(s)∗(BG)

on K(s)∗(BG1)/ImT r∗

1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ K(s)∗(BGn)/ImT r∗

n. Then

i) If Gi are good and so is G.
ii) K(s)∗(BG) is spanned, as a K(s)∗(pt)-module, by the elements of ImT r∗

and Imρ∗.

In particular this implies

Corollary 2.3. Let G = Gi, i 6= 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, then G is good in the sense of
Hopkins-Kuhn-Ravenel.

Proof. Note Gi has maximal abelian subgroup Hi = ha, bi on which the quotient
acts (diagonally) as above. Each of the following groups C2n+1 × C2, the dihedral
group D2n+2, the quasi-dihedral group QD2n+2, the semi-dihedral group SD2n+2
and the generalized quaternion group Q2n+2 could be written as semidirect product
C2n+1 ⋊ C2 with that kind of action. For all these groups K(s)∗(BG) is generated
by Euler classes, see [13, 14].
(cid:3)

For the classifying spaces of the above groups one can compute

χ(G) = rankK(s)∗ K(s)even(BG),

using the Euler characteristic formula of [7], Theorem D. The answer is as follows.

3. Complex representations over BG

Let us deﬁne some complex representations over BG we will need.
Let H = ha, bi ∼= C2n+1 × C2n+1 be the maximal abelian subgroup in G. Let
π : BH → BG be the double covering. Let λ and ν denote the following complex
line bundles over BH. Let

λ(a) = ν(b) = e2πi/2n+1

, λ(b) = λ(c) = ν(a) = ν(c) = 1,

be the pullbacks of the canonical complex line bundles along the projections onto
the ﬁrst and second factor of H respectively. Let

π!(λ) = IndG

H (λ) and π!(ν) = IndG

H (ν)

be the plane bundles over BG, the transferred λ and ν respectively.

The quotient of G2 by the center ha2n

, b2n

i is isomorphic to C3

2 . The projections

on the three factors induce three line bundles α, β and γ respectively:

α(a) = β(b) = γ(c) = −1, α(b) = α(c) = β(a) = β(c) = γ(a) = γ(b) = 1.

Let us denote Chern classes by

xi = ci(IndG
H (λ)), yi = ci(IndG
a = c1(α), b = c1(β), c = c1(γ).

H )(ν), i = 1, 2,

K(s)∗(BG), G = (C2n+1 × C2n+1 ) ⋊ C2

4. Proof of Theorem 1.1

Here we prove that all the remaining groups Gi, i = 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, not covered

by Corollary 2.3, are also good.

Our principal tool shall be the Serre spectral sequence

(4)

E2 = H ∗(BQ), K(s)∗(BH)) ⇒ K(s)∗(BG)

associated to a group extension 1 → H −→ G −→ Q → 1. Here H ∗(BQ), K(s)∗(BH))
denotes the ordinary cohomology of Q with coeﬃcients in the F2[Q]-module K(s)∗(BH),
where the action of Q is induced by conjugation in G.

Let T r∗ : K(s)∗(BH) → K(s)∗(BG) be the transfer homomorphism [1],[9], [5].

associated to the double covering π : BH → BG.

We use the notations of previous two sections. In particular let

H ∼= C2n+1 × C2n+1 ∼= ha, bi.

Consider the decomposition

[K(s)∗(BH)]C2 = [F ]C2 + T,

corresponding to the decomposition of K(s)∗(BH) into free and trivial C2-modules.
The action of the involution t ∈ C2 on

K(s)∗(BH) = K(s)∗[u, v]/(u2(n+1)s

, v2(n+1)s

)

is induced by conjugation action by c on H. Clearly the composition π∗T r∗ = 1 + t,
the trace map, is onto [F ]C2 . Therefore it suﬃces to check that all invariants in T
are also represented by good elements.

For all cases let

u =c1(λ),
¯x1 =u + t(u) = π∗(x1),
¯y1 =v + t(v) = π∗(y1),

v = c1(ν),
¯x2 = ut(u) = π∗(x2),
¯y2 = vt(v) = π∗(y2).

Note that for any action of the involution t one has

(5)

F (u, t(u)) ≡ (¯x2)2s−1

mod (¯x1f (¯x1, ¯x2) ∈ Im(1 + t).

This is because the formal group law has a form

F (x, y) = (xy)2s−1

+ (x + y)(1 + S(x, y)), where S is a symmetric series.

Then for each case of G there is a set of elements {xω} = {¯xi

1}, such that
the set {xω, xωu, xωv, xωuv} is a K(s)∗-basis in K(s)∗(BH). This is because using
u2 = u ¯x1 − ¯x2 and v2 = v ¯y1 − ¯y2 any polynomial in u, v can be uniquely written as
g0 + g1u + g2v + g3uv where gi = gi( ¯x1, ¯y1, ¯x2, ¯y2).

1 ¯xj

2 ¯yk

1 ¯xl

Let

g = f0 + f1u + f2v + f3uv, fi = fi( ¯x1, ¯y1 ¯x2, ¯y2)

be an invariant, that is, g ∈ Ker(1 + t). Then

f1 ¯x1 + f2 ¯y1 + f3(uv + t(uv)) = f1 ¯x1 + f2 ¯y1 + f3( ¯x1 ¯y1 + ¯x1v + ¯y1u) = 0

and we get

f3 ¯x1 = f3 ¯y1 = 0; f1 ¯x1 = f2 ¯y1.

Now let us prove Theorem 1.1 in the number of propositions below.

Proposition 4.1. Let G = G3. i) A basis of T is formed by the following set of
2(2n+1)s number of elements

ii) All elements of this set are good.

2 ¯yj
¯xi

1

Proof. Note that Proposition 4.1 i) says more than we claimed in Theorem 1.1. We
actually have to prove that T is generated by this set, and all elements are good.
Then our extra work below is to explain why the restrictions on i, j cleans the
elements in Im(1 + t) and that the set above indeed forms a basis for T . For the
latter we have to check that the number of basis elements agrees with K(s)∗-Euler
characteristic of G3, stated in Proposition 2.4.

To detect the invariants we have to apply (6) and take into account ﬁrst two

equations below

(7)

1 = 0, ¯y1 = 0, ¯x2(n+1)s−1
¯x2s

2

= 0, ¯y2ns−1

2

≡ 0 mod (1 + t).

The latter is easily checked as follows:

t(λ) = λν2n
t(ν) = ν, t(v) = v,

,

t(u) = F (u, v2ns

) = u + v2ns

+ (uv2ns

)2s−1

,

¯y1 = v + t(v) = 0,
¯y2 = vt(v) = v2,
¯x1 = u + t(u) = ¯y2ns−1
¯x2s
1 = 0.

2

+ u2s−1

¯y2ns+s−2

,

Now let us check that the elements in (4.1) are images of Euler classes under π∗.
Note u2 = u¯x1 + ¯x2 and it follows by induction, that

Then by deﬁnition

π∗(β) = ν2n
,
π∗(u′) = u2s

,

Taking into account (8) we get

(9) π∗(u′) = u2s

= u ¯x1

¯x2

= ¯x2s−1

2 + u ¯x1

2s−1 mod (1 + t).

As by deﬁnition ¯x2 = π∗(x2) and ¯y2 = π∗(y2), (9) implies that all elements of

the ﬁrst and second parts of the set i) are good.

K(s)∗(BG), G = (C2n+1 × C2n+1 ) ⋊ C2

7

For the rest part of i) note, that the bundle ν can be extended to a bundle over
BG, say ν ′. Denote v′ = c1(ν ′). Then π∗(v′) = v and combining this with (9) we
can easily read all elements of Proposition 4.1 as images of Euler classes.

As we mentioned above this already proves that G3 is good. The restrictions in

ii) follow by last two equations of (7), i.e., ¯y1 = 0 and

The K(s)∗-Euler characteristic χ(G3) in Proposition 2.4 agrees with the number

of basis elements of T in ii): It is easily checked that the latter is determined by

(χ(H) − x) : 2 + 2sx = χ(G).

In our case
(4(n+1)s − 2(2n+1)s) : 2 + 2s · 2(2n+1)s = 3 · 22(n+1)s−1 − 2(2n+1)s−1 = χ(G3).

set of 4ns good elements

Proof. G4: The involution acts as follows: t(λ) = λ2n+1ν2n

(10)

(11)

t(u) = F (u, F (u2ns

)) + u2s−1

F (u2ns

) = v + v2ns

+ (vv2ns

So that ¯x2s

1 = 0 and applying (8) we get

π∗(det(π!λ)) = λ2, π∗(e(det(π!λ))) = u2s
π∗(det(π!ν)) = ν2, π∗(e(det(π!ν))) = v2s
It follows G4 is good. For the restrictions on i, j note (10) and (5) imply that

The proof for G9 is completely analogous as it uses the similar formulas for the

action of the involution

The formula χ(T ) = 4ns for both cases, agrees with Proposition 2.4.

G7: Let ¯λ be the complex conjugate to λ and

¯u = [−1]F (u) = c1(¯λ), ¯v = [−1]F (v) = c1(¯ν).

The involution acts as follows

t(λ) = ¯λν2n

Then by (6),(14) and (14) all elements of Proposition 4.3 are invariants. To
can also be extended to

check all elements are good note the bundle λ2n
and ν2n
the bundles over BG, say λ′ and ν ′ respectively. So that

π∗(e(ν ′)) = e(ν2n

) = v2ns

and π∗(e(λ′)) = e(λ2n

) = u2ns

.

t(λ) = ¯λλ2n
t(u) = F (¯u, F (u2ns
t(v) = F (¯v, v2ns

).

)),

Then by (5) again ¯y2s−1

2

≡ v2ns

modulo some ¯y1f (¯y1, ¯y2) ∈ Im(1 + t). Therefore

¯y2ns−1
2

≡ 0 mod (1 + t) and applying (8) one has

π∗(e(det(π!ν)) = v2ns

≡ ¯y2ns−1

1

v + ¯y2ns−1

2

≡ ¯y2ns−1

1

v mod (1 + t).

Similarly ¯x2ns−1

2

≡ 0 mod (1 + t) and we get

π∗(e(det(π!λ)) = F (u2ns

, v2ns

) ≡ ¯x2ns−1

1

u + ¯y2ns−1

1

v mod(1 + t).

For G11 one has

¯νν2n

,

, t(ν) = λ2n

t(λ) = ¯λν2n
t(u) = F (¯u, v2ns
),
t(v) = F (¯v, F (u2ns
π∗(e(det(π!λ)) = v2ns
π∗(e(det(π!ν)) = F (u2ns

, v2ns

v mod(1 + t),

≡ ¯y2ns−1

1
, v2ns

) ≡ ¯x2ns−1

1

u + ¯y2ns−1

1

v mod(1 + t).

For all three cases one has

χ(G) = (4(n+1)s − 22s) : 2 + 2s · 22s = 22(n+1)s−1 − 22s−1 + 23s

as in Proposition 2.4.
