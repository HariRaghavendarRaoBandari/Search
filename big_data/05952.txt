Abstract: Run-I results from the CMS collaboration show an excess of events in the decay
h → µτe with a local signiﬁcances of 2.4σ. This could be the ﬁrst hint of ﬂavour violation in
the Higgs sector. We summarise the bounds on the ﬂavour violating Yukawa couplings from
direct searches, low energy measurements and projected future experiments. We discuss
the sensitivity of upcoming HL-LHC runs and future lepton colliders in measuring lepton-
ﬂavour violating couplings using an eﬀective ﬁeld theory framework. For the HL-LHC we

ﬁnd limits on BR(h → µτ ) and BR(h → eτ ) (cid:46) O(0.5)% and on BR(h → eµ) (cid:46) O(0.02)%.
For an ILC with center-of-mass energy of 1 TeV we expect BR(h → eτ ) and BR(h → µτ )
to be measurable down to O(0.2)%.

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has successfully discovered a scalar resonance of mass
around 125 GeV [1, 2], with properties in close agreement with the Standard Model (SM)
Higgs boson. Already now, both ATLAS and CMS collaborations have established its
couplings to massive gauge bosons and photons to a high degree of precision and found no
signiﬁcant deviations from SM predictions [3–5].

Direct limits on rather complex Higgs-fermion interactions were instead much less
probed during initial LHC runs. Only fairly weak limits were obtained on Higgs couplings
to b-quarks [3], τ -leptons [6, 7] and t-quarks [8–12]. Albeit the good overall agreement
between theory and experiment, i.e. the total signal strength measured from production
and decay modes is µ = 1.09 ± 0.11 [3], more conclusive evidence is required to establish
that the observed scalar resonance is indeed the SM Higgs boson.

In particular the Higgs decays to the ﬁrst and second generation fermions are yet to be
observed. While searches have been performed by ATLAS and CMS to measure the Higgs
decays to a µ+µ− pair [13, 14] and by CMS to an e+e− pair [14], only upper limits have
been obtained so far. Indirect limits on these decays could be potentially obtained from a
very precise measurement of the total Higgs decay width. While future linear colliders can
play an important role in this [15, 16], at present, the Higgs width is only fairly loosely

bounded to ΓH < 22 MeV (22.7 MeV) at 95% C.L from CMS (ATLAS) [17, 18] using highly
model-dependent oﬀ-shell coupling measurements [19, 20]. Further, a global coupling ﬁt
to Higgs data indicates that the Higgs boson can have a sizable non-standard branching
fraction, i.e. BRnon-std < 0.26 at 95% C.L [21]. Hence, within the present experimental
ﬁndings exotic Higgs decays into ﬁrst and second-generation fermions, gluons or missing
energy can be signiﬁcantly enhanced compared to SM predictions.

Among the many diﬀerent plausible non-standard decay modes of the Higgs boson,
one of the most intriguing are ﬂavour violating Higgs decays. In the SM, these decays are
highly suppressed, thus any experimental conﬁrmation of such a process will be conclusive
evidence of physics beyond the standard model (BSM). During run-I of the LHC, a number
of searches have been carried out both by CMS [22, 23] and ATLAS [24, 25]. The result
reported by CMS constrains the branching ratio BR(h → µτ ) < 1.51 % at 95% C.L, while
the upper limit on the branching ratio reported by ATLAS is 1.43%. Remarkably, both
CMS and ATLAS reported a mild excess in the h → µτe channel with a local signiﬁcances
of 2.4σ and 1.3σ respective1. These results can be explained with the best-ﬁt branching
ratio of BR(h → τ µ) = 0.84%(0.77%) for CMS (ATLAS). In addition, CMS also looked for
ﬂavour violation in the eµ and eτ channels [23]. Recently, ATLAS updated their results
from the h → eτ analysis at 8 TeV [24].

Apart from direct searches, ﬂavour violating interactions of the Higgs boson can also
be measured in low-energy observables, e.g. µ → eγ, τ → µγ, τ → eγ, τ → 3e, µ → 3e
and µ − e conversion in nuclei. For a detailed discussion, see Refs. [26, 27]. Hence, non-
observation of these processes puts additional constraints on ﬂavour violating couplings [26–
28].

Assuming the low energy dynamics can be described in terms of an eﬀective ﬁeld theory
(EFT), ﬂavour violation in the Higgs sector is highly correlated with ﬂavour violation
in low energy processes [26–29]. However, in the presence of light degrees of freedom,
this correlation might not hold. There have been several attempts to construct concrete
models that can explain large branching ratios of the Higgs into non-degenerate fermion
ﬂavours, while simultaneously satisfying all low energy constraints. Lepton ﬂavour violating
Higgs decays have been discussed in the context of supersymmetry [30–34], extended Higgs
sectors [35–49] and other BSM models [50–63]. Some collider aspects in the ﬂavour violating
sector have been studied in Refs. [64–68].

Thus, motivated by the recent searches carried out by CMS and ATLAS, we present
a detailed analysis of ﬂavour violation in direct and indirect experimental searches and
compare their sensitivities. We ﬁrst review the diﬀerent experimental constraints on Higgs
lepton-ﬂavour violating and non-violating couplings in section 2. Here we also discuss some
of the future limits of low energy experiments, e.g. MEG-II, Belle-II and super KEKB.
After establishing the reach of low energy constraints using an EFT framework, we study
the sensitivity of future high luminosity LHC runs on lepton ﬂavour violating decays in
section 3. We provide a case study for h → eτ at the ILC in section 4.
In sections 3

1ATLAS has studied 2 signal regions and the local signiﬁcance in one of the signal regions (SR2) is about

2.2σ.

and 4, we consider the respective LFV branching ratios as free parameters and evaluate
how well they can be constrained in collider measurements. Finally we discuss our ﬁndings
and summarise them in section 5.

2 Higgs couplings in the lepton sector

In the SM, the Yukawa couplings are proportional to the masses of the fermions. Conﬁr-
mation of this hypothesis requires independent measurements of the fermion masses and
their coupling strength to the Higgs boson. That is a strenuous task, particularly for the
Higgs boson couplings to the ﬁrst and second generation fermions. A precise statement
about the relation between Yukawa couplings and fermion masses is still at stake. Because
of the observation of the recent excess reported by CMS in the h → µτ channel, we are
restricting ourselves to a study of LFV interactions2. In this section we review and update
the existing searches on such LFV decays and summarise their bounds.

To give an interpretation of the measurements in terms of LFV interactions we consider
an eﬀective theory where the interaction between Higgs and fermions are given by the
Yukawa interactions

Hf ¯f couplings as shown in Eq. 2.1 after EWSB and hence we disregard further discussions
of these operators in the present study3.

2A detailed study on the ﬂavour violating Higgs in the quark sector has been discussed, for example in

Ref. [27].

3In Ref. [28], LFV has also been studied in the context of dipole operators of the form H ¯f σµν f Vµν . Such
operators can induce ﬂavour violating three body decays of the Higgs boson. However, precision constraints
are stringent and render the prospects of discovering these decays at collider experiments slim.

2.1 Present status of Higgs couplings in the lepton sector

We list the current constraints on the Higgs Yukawa couplings in the lepton sector. First,
we brieﬂy summarise the status of the ﬂavour diagonal and oﬀ-diagonal leptonic decays
from direct searches during run-I at the LHC. Next we discuss the low energy constraints
on the LFV Yukawas in an EFT framework.

2.1.1 Limits from direct searches

• h → e+e− : An upper limit on its branching ratio has been obtained by CMS [14] of
BR(h → e+e−) < 0.19%, which is about 3.7 × 105 times that of the SM expectation.
• h → µ+µ− : ATLAS and CMS obtain an upper limit on the branching ratio of
BR(h → µ+µ−) < 0.15% [13] and BR(h → µ+µ−) < 0.16% [14] respectively.
• h → τ +τ− : Both ATLAS [6] and CMS [7] have measured the Higgs boson coupling
to a pair of τ leptons. For mh = 125.36 GeV (125 GeV), ATLAS (CMS) has measured
a signal strength of 1.43+0.43−0.37 (0.78 ± 0.27) in this channel.

• h → eµ : CMS [23] sets a limit on BR(h → eµ) < 0.036% at 95% CL. One thus

obtains

|Yeµ|2 + |Yµe|2 < 5.43 × 10

−4.

(2.5)

(2.6)

(cid:113)

(cid:113)

• h → eτ : CMS [23] studied the h → eτµ and h → eτhad channels and obtained better
sensitivity than the current indirect limits. They ﬁnd BR(h → eτ ) < 0.69% at 95%

CL. From this limit one deduces(cid:112)

|Yeτ|2 + |Yτ e|2 < 2.41 × 10

−3.

On the other hand, ATLAS obtained a weaker limit BR(h → eτ ) < 1.04% at 95%
CL [24].

• h → µτ : The search was conducted in the channel pp → h → µτ , followed by the
leptonic as well as hadronic decays of τ . CMS reported a slight excess of events around
mh = 125 GeV in the h → µτe channel with a local signiﬁcance of 2.4σ [22]. From
this they obtained BR(h → µτ ) < 1.51% at 95% CL with a best-ﬁt of (0.84+0.39−0.37)%.
ATLAS has set an upper limit of 1.43% on this branching ratio at 95% CL [24]. From
the upper limit on BR(h → µτ ) from CMS one obtains

|Yµτ|2 + |Yτ µ|2 < 3.6 × 10

−3.

(2.7)

In our calculation, we have used that the partial decay width of 125 GeV Higgs into
two fermions is,

Γ(h → (cid:96)α(cid:96)β) =

mh
8π

(|Y(cid:96)α(cid:96)β|2 + |Y(cid:96)β (cid:96)α|2),

(2.8)

– 4 –

where (cid:96)α = (cid:96)β = e, µ, τ and α (cid:54)= β. The branching ratio for this decay mode is

BR(h → (cid:96)α(cid:96)β) =

Γ(h → (cid:96)α(cid:96)β)

ΓSM + Γ(h → (cid:96)α(cid:96)β)

,

(2.9)

where ΓSM = 4.1 MeV.

2.1.2 Limits from low-energy measurements

We motivate below the diﬀerent bounds on these Yukawa couplings that emerge from the
low energy ﬂavour violating processes and summarise these limits in Table 1.

• Yµτ is constrained by the non-observation of processes like τ → µγ and τ → 3µ. The
branching ratio of the process τ → µγ is bounded by BR(τ → µγ) < 4.4 × 10−8 at

90% C.L. [69, 70]. Assuming the low energy dynamics to be governed by the two
ﬂavour violating couplings Yµτ and Yτ µ, the decay width of this process reads as [27]

Γ(τ → µγ) =

(2.10)

where the Wilson coeﬃcients, cL and cR at one loop are given by

.

(2.11)

In the above expression, for simplicity, we assume that Yτ µ = Yµτ . Higher-order
corrections to cL/R receive contributions from the top Yukawa coupling and hence
can be large [27]. For example, including two-loop contributions, cL/R increases by
a factor O(4). For a full discussion on the dependence of Ytt we refer to Ref. [27].
Hence by assuming Yτ µ = Yµτ and also a SM-like Yτ τ , we obtain Yµτ (cid:46) 0.011.
In presence of ﬂavour violating Yukawa interactions, the process τ → 3µ has a decay
width of

Γ(τ → 3µ) =

α2m5
6(2π)5 (|cL|2 + |cR|2).
τ

(2.12)

Taking into account the one-loop contribution, the constraint on the Yukawa coupling
is, Yµτ < 0.177. Similar to the previous limit, this also depends on the couplings
Yτ τ , Yµµ and Ytt and their SM values have been assumed in deriving the limit on Yµτ .
This limit is weaker than τ → µγ due to an additional factor of α (where α is the
ﬁne-structure constant).

• The coupling Yτ e is also constrained from similar low energy ﬂavour violating pro-
cesses, such as, τ → eγ and τ → 3e. The decay width for τ → eγ has a similar
expression as given in Eq. 2.10, where µ has to be replaced by e [27]. Under similar
assumptions, one obtains Yτ e (cid:46) 0.01 from τ → eγ, while from τ → 3e, this is re-

laxed owing to the extra α factor. Assuming Yτ e = Yeτ , we show the bounds on the
Yukawas in Table. 1.

• The Yukawa coupling Yµe is severely constrained by the µ → eγ limit from MEG [71].
The Wilson coeﬃcients have similar expression as given in Eq. 2.10, with {τ, µ} →
10−13 [69] imposes a tight constraint on the Yukawa(cid:112)
{µ, e}. The two loop contribution proportional to the top Yukawa coupling can be
large [27]. The updated limit on the branching ratio, viz., BR(µ → eγ) < 5.7 ×
|Yµe|2 + |Yeµ|2 (cid:46) 1.75 × 10−6.
Assuming, Yµe = Yeµ this constrains Yµe (cid:46) 1.24 × 10−6. The other LFV process,i.e,
µ → 3e constrains Yµe (cid:46) 2.19 × 10−5.
• In addition to the above constraints, for complex Yukawa couplings, severe constraints
appear from the electric dipole moment measurement. The electric dipole moment
for the electron is |de| ≤ 10.5 ± 0.07 × 10−26e cm [69], which constrains the complex
Yukawas |Im(Yeτ Yτ e)| (cid:46) 1.1 × 10−8 and, |Im(YeµYµe)| (cid:46) 9.8 × 10−8.
From the electric dipole measurement of muons, we have −10 × 10−20e cm < dµ <
8 × 10−20e cm [72]. This puts a weak constraint on −0.8 (cid:46) |Im(Yµτ Yτ µ)| (cid:46) 1.0 [27].
• The stringent constraint on µ → eγ branching ratio can also be used to set the limit
on the product of the ﬂavour violating couplings Yτ µ and Yτ e. The limit from MEG,
BR(µ → eγ) < 5.7 × 10−13 [69], imposes the constraint (|Yτ µYeτ|2 + |Yµτ Yτ e|2)
1
4 <
2.373 × 10−4 . Again assuming Yτ µ = Yµτ and Yτ e = Yeτ , one obtains, Yτ µYeτ (cid:46)
3.98 × 10−8.
• Besides, there are also constraints on the LFV Yukawa couplings from muonium-
(cid:112)
antimuonium oscillations [73, 74], magnetic dipole moments [75, 76] and from µ → e
conversions in nuclei [27, 77]. Furthermore, there are constraints from LEP which
|Y(cid:96)e|2 + |Ye(cid:96)|2 < few × 10−1 [78]. These constraints are tabulated in
excludes
Table 1. For a detailed review on these constraints, we refer the reader to Ref. [27].

2.1.3 Future limits

In this subsection we brieﬂy discuss the expected future limits on the ﬂavour diagonal and
ﬂavour violating couplings of the Higgs boson in the lepton sector.

• h → e+e− : Ref. [79] discusses the present and future bounds on the Yee Yukawa
inary part of this Yukawa, i.e. < 1.7 × 10−2 times the SM electron Yukawa, Ye.

coupling. The ACME bound on the EDM puts a strong constraint on the imag-

The deviations of the real part are far less constrained. The authors ﬁnd that the
constraint coming from 8 TeV LHC data is the strongest. A limit κe < 611 can be
derived, where κe is a multiplicative complex parameter to the SM Yukawa, which
parametrises the deviation from the SM Yukawa coupling. Noting that for the 14
TeV run, the production cross-section of the Higgs will increase by a factor of ∼ 2.5,
−1. For a 100 TeV pp collider
they project that κe ∼ 260(150) with L = 300(3000) fb
with L = 3000 fb
• h → µ+µ− : In Ref. [80], it is mentioned that by combining the gluon fusion and
weak boson fusion channels, it is possible to obtain a 3σ signiﬁcance for h → µ+µ−

−1, κe ∼ 75.

bound the Higgs-light fermion couplings better than the present and future runs of
the LHC. By studying the isotope shift of the Y b ion they show that one can bound

come from the run-I searches at the LHC. These constraints however have been obtained
assuming no correlation between the two ﬂavour violating couplings. Assuming the validity
of an EFT and a non-zero Yµτ explaining the excess seen by CMS, the limits on Yeτ are
strongest from a measurement of BR(µ → eγ) which sets an upper limit on |Yµτ Yeτ| at
3.98×10−8. Thus, combining the excess in h → µτ with the best-ﬁt branching ratio of
BR(h → µτ ) = 0.84% and the MEG limit [71] on µ → eγ, we get Yeτ ∼ 2 × 10−5, which
is stronger than present LHC limit (Yeτ < 1.7 × 10−3 at 95% CL). For generic complex

Yukawas, we show the constraints on Re(Yeτ ) and Im(Yeτ ) in Fig. 1. In the left panel, we
show the existing constraints from the direct searches and the low energy experiments. The
gray region is in agreement with the ﬂavour violating low energy processes, i.e. τ → eγ,
τ → 3e, electron EDM and electron g − 2 as summarised in Table 1. Finally we show
the combined constraint from h → µτ (CMS) and µ → eγ (MEG). The blue (solid) and
red (dashed) lines represent BR(h → µτ ) = 1.51% and 0.84% respectively. In the right
panel, we show the individual limits from τ → eγ (pink region) and the future sensitivity
from Belle-II [84] (red line) which will constrain the ﬂavour violating Yukawa couplings
by a further factor of O(0.1). The gray region in the right panel satisﬁes the constraint
from h → µτ and µ → eγ decays, where the branching ratio of h → µτ ranges from
0.84 − 1.51%. From Fig. 1, it is evident that the limit on Yτ e is more stringent than the
current LHC limit, provided that BR(h → µτ ) lies between 0.84− 1.51% which is required
to explain the excess seen by CMS. In case Yµτ is negligibly small, then BR(h → eτ ) can be
as large as 0.69% from the direct LHC searches. The future sensitivity of MEG-II [83] will
constrain this coupling even further. In addition, the future constraints coming from the
Mu2e experiment can become even more severe [88]. However, these constraints depend
strongly on the validity of the eﬀective ﬁeld theory. If the underlying degrees of freedoms
are light enough, then the EFT description will not be valid [32, 40].

In the following section 3, we analyse the collider reach to probe lepton-ﬂavour vio-
lating Higgs interactions in the eµ, µτ and eτ decay modes for the 14 TeV LHC and its
future upgrades with 3000 fb

−1. Subsequently, we analyse the reach of h → eτ at the ILC.

3 Direct detection of LFV at the HL-LHC

From the previous section, we see that the strongest constraint on Yµτ arises from a direct
search at CMS. However, the constraints from low energy measurements on Yeτ and Yeµ
are still considerably stronger. However, it is important to note that all constraints de-
rived from the low energy experiments are subject to correlations among various Yukawa
couplings, which are innate in any EFT approach. In this section, we evaluate the high-
luminosity LHC’s potential to set limits on the three LFV Higgs decays, while being com-
pletely agnostic about low-energy constraints.
If direct searches ﬁnd evidence for both
h → µτ and h → eτ in the near future - and if then as a result the bound on |Yµτ Yeτ| is
found to be weaker than obtained from the low energy experiments an interpretation in
terms of an eﬀective ﬁeld theory approach will be at stake and has to be augmented with
a less constraining theory assumption.

Taking a cue from Sec. 2.1, here we evaluate the possible reach of a 14 TeV high-
luminosity LHC with integrated luminosities up to 3000 fb−1 in measuring lepton-ﬂavour
violation in the Higgs sector. Hence, we implement the relevant ﬂavour violating interac-
tions of the Higgs and the charged leptons in FeynRules [89]. The generated Universal
FeynRules Output (UFO) [90] model is then used as input to the Monte-Carlo (MC) event
generator MadGraph5 aMC@NLO [91]. Parton-showering and hadronisation is carried out us-
ing Pythia 6 [92]. Thus, the τ decays are simulated using TAUOLA [93]. Finally we perform
a detector simulations using Delphes 3 [94] where the jets are reconstructed using the
anti-kt algorithm [95] with a jet parameter of R = 0.5, as implemented in FastJet [96]. In
the following three subsections we show the prospects of each of the lepton ﬂavour violating
Higgs decays.

3.1 Prospect of µτ channel

Before performing the 14 TeV analysis for these three LFV decays, we reproduced the 8
TeV pp → h → µτ numbers as reported in the CMS run-I [22] results. After imposing a
tight τ−tagging eﬃciency of 30% in Delphes and adopting the cuts as presented in [22],
we found our result to be in close agreement with the CMS result.

In this subsection we focus on the channel where an excess of events have already been
in h → µτ . Among all the possible ﬁnal states, e.g. eµ + /ET , µµ + /ET and
seen, i.e.
µ + τh + /ET , the channel where τ → µ + /ET is the cleanest one. In order to reduce the
backgrounds, we implement the CMS-like selection cuts as listed in Ref. [22]. The diﬀerent
backgrounds for this ﬁnal state are listed in Table. 2. The order to which these backgrounds
are computed is discussed in section 3.2. For the signal, we ﬁrst consider the branching ratio
of h → µτ as 0.84%, that corresponds to the central value for the excess reported by CMS.
Hence, for the 14 TeV LHC, the signal and background events for pp → h → eµ + /ET with
−1 are 251 and 1135 respectively. This results in a 2.1σ statistical signiﬁcance.
L ∼ 37 fb
We further analyse the sensitivity reach of the HL-LHC for this channel. In Table 3, we
list the number of signal and background events for an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb−1.
We ﬁnd that this branching ratio h → µτ can be constrained down to 0.76% (1.90%) with
a 2σ (5σ) statistical signiﬁcance. However, this can be further optimised by adding more
cuts or using a multi-variate analysis. We discuss such an optimisation for the h → eτ
channel in the section 3.2.

To derive the above signiﬁcances and reach, we deﬁne the statistical signiﬁcance, S1

by assuming a ﬂat 10% systematic uncertainty on the backgrounds

S1 =

S

√S + B + κ2B2

,

(3.1)

where κ = 10% in our case. We further note that for a very low value of systematic
uncertainty (κ (cid:39) 0), the signiﬁcance is given by

S2 = S/√S + B

(3.2)

and one achieves 2σ signiﬁcance for a branching ratio of ∼ 0.025%.

3.2 Prospect of eτ channel

Here we consider the ﬂavour violating Higgs decay to eτ , followed by the hadronic as well
as leptonic decays of τ . For the 14 TeV eτ analysis we follow the proposal of Ref. [97]
and adopt a τ tagging and mistagging eﬃciencies of (40%, 0.2%). Here we consider the
following ﬁnal states:

• pp → h → eτ → ee + /ET
• pp → h → eτ → µe + /ET
• pp → h → eτ → eτhad + /ET
The major SM backgrounds for the processes mentioned above are τ τ + jet (computed
at the next-to-next-to leading order (NNLO) [98]), V V (with V = W ±, Z) (at the next-
to leading order (NLO) [99]), W + jets (at NLO [100]), with W decaying leptonically
and one of the jets mistagged as a τ -hadron, ee+jets (computed at NNLO [101]), t¯t (at
next-to-next-to-next-to leading order (N3LO) [102]), single-top (at NLO [103]) and the

SM-Higgs backgrounds (also computed at NNLO), i.e. h → τ +τ−. For the single-top

background, the W t mode has the dominant contribution for our scenario, whereas the
s- and t-channel contributions are negligible. So, for simplicity, we multiplied our leading
order (LO) cross-section by the NLO k-factor for the W t mode. Besides these, there are
some fake backgrounds like QCD multi-jets, where the jets might fake leptons, and W γ,
where the photon might convert to an electron-positron pair. However, it is very diﬃcult
to get a proper estimate for these backgrounds without doing a full detector simulation or

– 11 –

without using data driven methods. For all practical purposes, these backgrounds will not
signiﬁcantly alter our quoted results. Hence we neglect these in the present analysis.

For the τ τ + jet background, viz., the major background for the eµ ﬁnal state, we
perform an ME-PS MLM matching in the MadGraph framework. For the W + jets back-
ground, which is the single most important background for the eτhad ﬁnal state, we also
simulate a matched sample with up to two partonic jets. We select only those events where
at least one of the jets fake a τ -hadron. We perform an inclusive study and demand no jet
veto. Similarly a matched sample was generated for the ee+jet background, which is the
dominant background for the ee ﬁnal state. To optimise the signal sensitivity, we adopt
similar cuts as done by the CMS 8 TeV analysis for h → eτ ﬁnal state [23]. In addition,
we also optimise over the pT cuts in order to gain maximum sensitivity.

The common set of trigger cuts that we use for all the ﬁnal states in this subsection

are:

• The transverse momentum of e, µ and jet are: pT (e) > 10 GeV, pT (µ) > 10 GeV and

pT (j) > 30 GeV respectively,

• The pseudo-rapidity of e, µ and jet: |η(e)| < 2.1, |η(e)| < 2.3 and |η(j)| < 4.7.
We use diﬀerent selection cuts for the three diﬀerent ﬁnal states ee + /ET , µe + /ET and

eτhad + /ET . For the eµ + /ET ﬁnal state we use the following selection cuts:

• /ET > 30 GeV
• The azimuthal angle separations: ∆φ
• The transverse mass variable: MT (µ) < 65 GeV and MT (e) > 50 GeV, where the

For the ee + /ET ﬁnal state, the cuts are exactly same as in the previous case with the
following transformations µ → e2, e → e1, where e1 is the electron coming from the Higgs
decay and e2 comes from the τ decay. For the remaining ﬁnal state eτhad + /ET , we use the
following selection cuts:

Table 4. Optimized pT cuts for the three ﬁnal states.

From Table 6, one can observe a BR(h → eτ ) of around 1.5% at 5σ for the eµ ﬁnal
state. For the ee ﬁnal state we require a somewhat larger branching ratio to have a 5σ
statistical signiﬁcance. Whereas for the hadronic ﬁnal state one can not go below ∼ 5.1% in
order to obtain a 5σ signiﬁcance with such a cut-based analysis. If we statistically combine
these three signiﬁcances in quadrature, then we attain a 2σ signiﬁcance for a branching
ratio of 0.50%. Combining them additively, one achieves 2σ for as low a branching ratio
as ∼ 0.32%. To see if one can probe lower branching ratios in the eµ channel, we exploit
the kinematics of both the signal and the background in more details. We perform a
multivariate analysis with the Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) algorithm using the root
based TMVA [104] framework. We choose 11 kinematic variables for this purpose, viz.

For the MVA, we take care of the issue of overtraining of the signal/background. The
Kolmogorov Smirnov (KS) test is used to check for the overtraining of a sample. The test
sample is not overtrained if the KS probability lies between 0.1 to 0.9. In most cases, a
critical KS probability value more than 0.01 [105] ensures that the signal and background
samples are not overtrained.

We ﬁnd after a proper training of the sample, that an optimised cut on the BDT yields
a better reach on the branching ratio. In table 7, we tabulate the signal and dominant
background events at an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb−1 after an optimised cut on the
BDT variable.

To achieve a 5σ discovery one can not go below a branching ratio of 1.20%. We see that
the MVA analysis improves the reach by a factor of ∼ 1.28 for the eµ + /ET ﬁnal state. We
also note that in 3.2 we obtained the reach on BR(h → µτ ) with the CMS-like cuts. With
an MVA, however, we expect a similar improvement in this channel as in the eτ sector.

cut-based analysis for a branching ratio of 0.028% by using Eq. 3.2.

3.3 Prospect of eµ
Inspired by CMS’s direct search for the ﬂavour violating decay h → eµ [23], we study the
prospect of observing this channel at the HL-LHC. For this analysis, we apply the following
simple set of cuts :

• pT (e) > 40 GeV and pT (µ) > 40 GeV
• |ηe| < 1.479 and |ηµ| < 0.8 (in the barrel)
• /ET < 20 GeV
• 123 GeV < mh < 127 GeV.
Here also we compute the backgrounds at the orders speciﬁed in section 3.2. The
major backgrounds are eµ + /ET (dominantly from W W production), Drell-Yan production
of τ τ , t¯t, e(µ) + τ + /ET (also dominantly from W W production), τ τ + /ET (mainly coming
from W W and ZZ) and single top (dominantly from the W t production). In Table 8 we
list the number of signal and background events after all the selection cuts for the HL-LHC
at 3000 fb−1. Finally in Table 9, we show the prospective reach.
analysis for as low a branching ratio of 1.65 × 10−3% by using Eq. 3.2.
4 h → eτ at ILC
In the previous section, we discussed the prospects of observing a lepton ﬂavour violating
Higgs in all the three possible channels at a 14 TeV LHC with an integrated luminosity
going up to 3000 fb−1. We saw that one can deﬁnitely expect improvements compared
to the 8 TeV results but due to the large backgrounds and huge uncertainties, these are
not so dramatic as one would like. We know that LHC is plagued with huge backgrounds
and hence we can expect better precision at lepton colliders. In this section, we repeat

Here also we note that one can attain a 2σ signiﬁcance in the eµ channel with the this

improvement can be expected for the h → µτ as well. For eµ, we do not expect a signiﬁcant
improvement at ILC because in section 3.3, we already saw that the reach for the branching
ratio can be as low as 1.95 × 10−2%. The number of signal events are expected to be very

low at the ILC for such small branching ratios.

The two main topologies that we study here are the associated production of the Higgs
with a Z-boson and the Higgs produced in association with neutrinos through the t-channel
fusion diagram. At 250 GeV, the associated production with a Z-boson oﬀers the largest
cross-section with the Z decaying hadronically, whereas for the leptonic modes of Z, the
total cross-section is suppressed. Hence, we study in detail the Zh, Z → q ¯q production for
√s = 250 GeV. For the 1 TeV study, we consider the /Eh channel which includes both the
t-channel contribution mediated by W -boson and an s-channel contribution from the Zh
topology. However, here the contribution coming from the latter is nominal. The diﬀerent
ﬁnal states that we study in this section can be summarised as :

• e+e−
• e+e−
ILC at √s = 250 GeV

→ Zh, h → τ e, with Z →≥ 2j and τ → eν, µν or τ tagged as τhad
→ /Eh, h → τ e, with τ → eν, µν or τ tagged as τhad.

4.1
In this subsection, we simulate a prospective analysis at the ILC with √s = 250 GeV. The
dominant backgrounds for the various ﬁnal states are:

• Z(cid:96)(cid:96)νν, Z(cid:96)(cid:96)(cid:96)(cid:96) and W (cid:96)ν(cid:96)(cid:96), followed by the hadronic decays of Z and W , viz. Z → q ¯q
and W → qq(cid:48). In short, we denote these backgrounds with the tag, 3V -like,

– 16 –

• eeZ and τ τ Z, followed by Z → qq. In short, we denote these backgrounds as 2V -like,

where q = light jets + b-jets and (cid:96) = e, µ, τ .

Here we perform a cut-based analysis with the following set of general selection cuts:

• Demand that at least two jets reconstruct the Z-boson mass with a window of 25

GeV, i.e., MZ − 25 GeV < Mjj < MZ + 25 GeV.

• For the associated production Zh, we apply the cuts on the invariant mass of the

visible products:

(cid:5) The visible invariant mass lies in 110 GeV < Meµ < 140 GeV for eµ.
(cid:5) The visible invariant mass lies in 120 GeV < Mee < 130 GeV for ee.
(cid:5) The visible invariant mass lies in 110 GeV < Meτhad < 140 GeV for eτhad.

• In addition to the above cuts, we demand a cut on | cos(θjj)| < 0.8 for the eejj

channel in order to reduce the 2V -like background.

In Table 10, we list the number of signal and background events after the selection cuts
for the dominant modes. Finally in Table 11, we show the reach of the ILC for BR(h → eτ )
in these dominant ﬁnal states with √s = 250 GeV. For this purpose, we use a diﬀerent
formula for the signiﬁcance as compared to LHC, owing to the fact that the systematic
uncertainties are expected to be signiﬁcantly less for the ILC. We use the standard formula
as quoted in the ILC Snowmass report [106], viz.

On statistically combining these three signiﬁcances in quadrature, we attain a 2σ
signiﬁcance for a branching ratio of 0.38%. Combining them additively, one achieves 2σ for

as low a branching ratio as ∼ 0.25%. So we see that the ILC at √s = 250 GeV performs

comparably with the high luminosity LHC for these sets of simple cuts. To see if we have

ILC at √s = 1 TeV

The ILC at 1 TeV motivates us to study the Higgs in association with missing energy
because of much cleaner backgrounds. Another reason for studying the prospects at the 1
TeV ILC is the 1000 fb−1 integrated luminosity. Here, we implement the following selection
cuts:

• For the eµ + /E channel, we apply :

(cid:5) 1.5 < ∆φµ /E < 3.0
(cid:5) The visible momentum, |(cid:126)pvis| < 200 GeV

The dominant backgrounds for these channels can be summarised as:

• τ +τ−,
• 2(cid:96) + 2ν and
• 4(cid:96),

where (cid:96) = e, µ, τ .

These optimised cuts are applied to compute the signiﬁcance in these three channels.
We must note here that the ∆φ distributions for the τ +τ− background peak at 0 and
π. Hence our ∆φ cuts almost completely eradicate this background. The signal and
background events after imposing the above sets of selection cuts are found in Table 12.
The signiﬁcances and the reach are summarised in table 13.

Here also, on statistically combining the three signiﬁcances in quadrature, we obtain a

for as low branching a ratio as ∼ 0.16%. We see that the ILC at 1 TeV with L = 1000 fb
performs better. But, we must note that with neither scenario we can measure a branching
ratio of less than 0.1%.

In doing the computations for the ILC, we consider unpolarised beams for the 250
GeV analysis because there is no signiﬁcant enhancement in the signal. But for the 1 TeV
analysis we consider the e− and e+ polarisations as (-80,20). Here we see a signiﬁcant
increase in the signal cross-section by ∼ 2.15 times even though the dominant background,
i.e. 2(cid:96)2ν also increases by a factor of 2. So we gain in sensitivity for the polarised beams in
this scenario. In contrast to the LHC studies, here we have performed a leading order anal-
ysis. However, the next-to-leading order eﬀects are not expected to change our conclusions
appreciably.

Here, we must comment on the fact that the ILC capabilities [15] on measuring an
invisible branching ratio (which can very well be read as non-standard branching ratio)
can be as low as 0.54% for a 250 GeV ILC machine with an integrated luminosity of 250

fb−1 and this decreases to around 0.22% for √s = 1 TeV with L = 1000 fb−1. As we can

see that the numbers that we have obtained are in the ballpark of these quoted limits. We
also mention that our analysis in the ILC sector can be further improved by optimising the
cuts to a greater degree or by using a multivariate technique after identifying interesting
variables.

5 Summary

The run-I results from CMS and ATLAS gave us the ﬁrst hint at ﬂavour violation in the
Higgs sector in the channel h → µτ with a best-ﬁt branching ratio of less than a percent.
The 8 TeV collider searches in the other two LFV channels, i.e. h → eτ and h → eµ did
not have any signiﬁcant excess over the respective SM backgrounds. Conﬁrmation of any
of these ﬂavour violating processes will necessarily indicate the existence of new physics.

In this work, we performed rigorous collider analyses to get an estimates of the discov-
ery prospect of all the three lepton ﬂavour violating Higgs decays, at the high luminosity
run of the 14 TeV LHC. We also performed a case study for h → eτ at the ILC with
√s = 250 GeV and 1 TeV.

Below we summarise our ﬁndings from the collider analyses.

• We analysed the prospect of h → µτ and h → eτ at the 14 TeV LHC with L =
3000 fb−1 and found that a BR(h → µτ /eτ ) of ∼ 0.5 % can be probed with a 2σ

signiﬁcance.

• We obtained the prospects of observing the cleaner channel h → eµ at the HL-
LHC with an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb−1. We found that to achieve a 2σ
signiﬁcance, one can go as low as 1.95 × 10−2% in the branching ratio.
• In addition to the LHC, we also showed the prospects of studying Higgs ﬂavour
violation at the ILC with √s = 250 GeV and 1 TeV. A branching ratio, BR(h → eτ )

as low as 0.24% can be probed for the the h + /E channel with a 2σ statistical

– 20 –

signiﬁcance and with an integrated luminosity of 1000 fb−1 at the 1 TeV ILC. We
also expect similar improvement in the µτ sector compared to HL-LHC.

Hence, we see that the discovery of lepton ﬂavour violation in h → µτ and/or the
h → eτ at collider experiments will imply large branching ratios of few times O(0.1%).
The simultaneous discovery of both these channels at the 14 TeV HL-LHC or at the ILC
will no doubt question the validity of an EFT approach. This will prompt us in building
models with relatively light massive states. However, if there is only evidence for one of
the processes, we can not make strong statements about the existence of light degrees
of freedom. Our present study thus encourages the experimental groups to look for these
unique signatures and gives an estimate of the smallest branching ratios that can be probed
at the near-future colliders.
