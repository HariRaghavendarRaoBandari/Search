Abstract

In this contribution we study the Klein-Gordon oscillator on the curved background within the

Kaluza-Klein theory. The problem of interaction between particles coupled harmonically with a

topological defects in Kaluza-Klein theory is studied. We consider a series of topological defects,

that treat the Klein-Gordon oscillator coupled to this background and ﬁnd the energy levels and

corresponding eigenfunctions in these cases. We show that the energy levels depend on the global

parameters characterizing these spacetimes. We also investigate a quantum particle described by

the Klein-Gordon oscillator interacting with a cosmic dislocation in Som-Raychaudhuri spacetime

in the presence of homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld in a Kaluza-Klein theory. In this case, the spectrum

of energy is determined, and we observe that these energy levels are the sum of the term related

with Aharonov-Bohm ﬂux and of the parameter associated to the rotation of the spacetime.

INTRODUCTION

Harmonic interactions play a important role in physics mainly when we consider the mo-

tion of particles in presence of molecular potentials and electromagnetic ﬁelds. Particularly,

the harmonic oscillator appears as a prototype model in many areas of physics such as solid

states physics, quantum statistical mechanics and quantum ﬁeld theory, and indeed serves

as an important physical system to study the concepts and mathematical tools in standard

quantum physics. At the same time, within the relativistic quantum mechanics, the eﬀects

introduced by the peculiar motion of the particles in physical system at the high energy

can be considered. Together, quantum and relativistic eﬀects has received a great attention

within the quantum treatment of dynamics of particles occurring in backgrounds produced

by topological defects [1–4]. Most recently, a relativistic version of the harmonic oscillator

was studied in a commutative and noncommutative ﬁeld theory [5, 6] among other conﬁg-

urations including magnetic ﬁelds [7–9]. The Dirac oscillator was investigated for spin 1/2

in the presence of topological defects in Refs. [10–18]. However, these studies were carried

out for quantum dynamics of spin 1/2 particles, leaving a gap in treatment of these eﬀects

for integer spin particles.

Several studies have demonstrated an interest in relativistic models [19–22] where the

interaction potential is similar to that one of the harmonic oscillator, such as the vibrational

spectrum of diatomic molecules [23], the binding of heavy quarks [24, 25] and the oscillations

of atoms in crystal lattices, by mapping them as a position-dependent mass system [26–29].

The importance of these potentials arises from the presence of a strong potential ﬁeld.

Recently, Bahar and Yasuk [19], intending to study the the quark-antiquark interaction,

have investigated a problem of a relativistic spin-0 particle possessing a position-dependent

mass, where the mass term acquires a contribution given by an interaction potential that

consists of a linear and a harmonic conﬁning potential plus a Coulomb potential term.

The Klein-Gordon oscillator was inspired by earlier papers on Dirac oscillator applied

to half-integer spin particles. Recently Rao et al.

[31] studied the spectral distribution

of energy levels and eigenfunctions sets assumed by a particle by solving the Klein-Gordon

equation in one-dimensional version of Minkowski spacetimes. In recent paper, Boumali and

Messai [30] have investigated a Klein-Gordon oscillator in the background of cosmic string in

the presence of uniform magnetic ﬁeld. The Klein-Gordon oscillator was investigated in the

3

presence of Coulomb potential considering two way of coupling of Coulomb potential within

the Klein-Gordon equation:

in the ﬁrst paper [32] the Coulomb potential is incorporated

in the equation by a modiﬁcation mass term, in the second model [33] this potential is

introduced in Klein-Gordon equation via the minimal coupling, in this last case the linear

potential also was included in the equation. Our intention now is to extend these study

not only to other dimensions but mostly to consider this dynamics in general background

spacetimes produced by topological defects using the Kaluza-Klein theory [34, 35]. These

sources of gravitational ﬁelds play a important role in Condensed Matter Physics Systems

[38–41], mainly due to the possibility to compensate the elastic contribution introduced by

the defect by a ﬁne tuning of external magnetic ﬁeld. Besides of topological defects like

cosmic strings [42] and domain walls [43], a global monopole [44] provides a tiny relation

between eﬀects in cosmology and gravitation and those in Condensed Matter Physics system,

where topological defects analogous to cosmic strings appear in phase transitions in liquid

crystal [45, 46]. Recently, the Klein-Gordon oscillator in the Som-Raychaudhuri spacetime

in the presence of uniform magnetic ﬁelds is investigated by Wang et al.[47].

This contribution is organized as follow:

in the section (II), using the Kaluza-Klein

theory, we study the energy levels of particles interacting with gravitational ﬁeld produced

by cosmic string in the presence of the Klein-Gordon oscillator.

In the section (III), we

study the quantum dynamics in the presence of the magnetic cosmic string, calculating

the spectral energy as well as the corresponding eigenfunctions. In (IV), we consider the

case in which the background has a torsional source of gravitational ﬁeld added to the

curvature source introduced by the conical defect. To consider the contribution introduced

by a magnetic ﬁeld to this dynamics in the (V) section, we consider a homogeneous magnetic

ﬁeld ﬁlling the space accessible to Klein-Gordon particle. Additionally to the magnetic ﬁeld

we consider rotational spacetimes, whose rotation is introduced via geometric description of

Kaluza-Klein theory. In (VI), some discussion of our results will be presented.

II. KLEIN-GORDON OSCILLATOR IN COSMIC STRING BACKGROUND

The purpose of this section is to study the Klein-Gordon oscillator in the background of

the cosmic string with use of the Kaluza-Klein theory [2, 34, 35]. The metric corresponding

4

to this geometry can be written as,

ds2 = −dt2 + dρ2 + α2ρ2dφ2 + dz2 + dx2

(1)

where t is the time coordinate, x is the coordinate associated with the ﬁfth additional

dimension and (ρ, φ, z) are cylindrical coordinates. These coordinates assume, respectively,
the following range −∞ < (t, z, x) < ∞, 0 ≤ ρ < ∞, 0 ≤ φ ≤ 2π. The α parameter,
characteristic of cosmic string, is given in terms of mass density of the string µ, by α = 1−4µ.
The cosmology and gravitation imposes limits to the range of the α parameter which is

restricted to α < 1. Moreover, in Condensed Matter Physics systems, this restriction is free

and the opposite case α > 1, known negative disclination, can occur in several systems as

those described by [46].

To couple the Klein-Gordon oscillator to this background we use the Mirza and Mohadesi
µ →

prescription [6], in which, we carry out the following change in momentum operator p2
(~pµ + iMw~r) · (~pµ − iMw~r). In this way, the general Klein-Gordon equation becomes

(cid:26) 1
√−g

(∂µ + Mwρ)√−ggµν(∂ν − Mwρ) − M 2(cid:27) Ψ = 0

(2)

with g being the determinant of the metric tensor and gµν is the inverse metric tensor, ∂µ,ν

are partial derivatives with respect to the coordinates. The matrix gµν is of the form

gµν = diag(−1, 1, 1/α2ρ2, 1, 1)

(3)

in this way the equation (2) becomes

(cid:26) 1
x − 2Mw − M 2 and x is ﬁfth spatial coordinate in Kaluza-Klein the-
with γ = −∂2
ory. Supposing a temporal independence of our background and translational symmetry

α2ρ2 − M 2w2ρ2 + γ(cid:27) Ψ = 0

∂ρ(ρ∂ρ) +

(4)

∂2

ρ

t + ∂2

z + ∂2

along the axis x and z, we can choose the following ansatz,

Ψ = e−i(Et−kz−lφ−λx)R(ρ),

in this way, the equation (4) transforms into

(cid:26) 1

ρ

∂ρ(ρ∂ρ) −(cid:20) l2

α2ρ2 + M 2w2ρ2 − γ(cid:21)(cid:27) R(ρ) = 0,

(5)

(6)

that, with help of (5) the last term in above equation is rewritten as γ = E2 − M 2 − 2Mw −
k2 − λ2. This equation can be transformed in other one by the following change of the
variable ξ = Mwρ2. The result is

Now we proceed with study of the asymptotic limit at origin and inﬁnity. In what follows,

we suppose,

R(ξ) = ξ

Substituting of R(ξ) in this form in the equation (7) results in

where γ is as before. We can see that this equation is just that one for the conﬂuent
hypergeometric function, xF ′′(x) + (c + 1 − x)F ′(x) − aF (x) = 0, whose solution is a
polynomial of degree n in x. Naturally there is a convergence problem in this solution when

n tends to inﬁnity. To avoid this divergence, we can choice the independent term, last term,

in equation (9) to be equal to a non-negative number. Mathematically we have,

using the respective expressions to γ and solving the resultant equation to E we obtain the

(12)

Note the dependence on nonlocal parameters of the background for energy levels as well as

for the eigenfunctions is responsible in breaking of degeneracy of the energy levels due to

the presence of the parameter α. We observe that the present result is similar with that

one obtained by Boumali and Messai [30] for Klein-Gordon oscillator in the background of
cosmic string in Einstein gravity. Further, in the weak oscillator limit w → 0, our particles
behave like free particles. Moreover, if ﬂat spacetime limit α −→ 1 is taken the results in
[31] are reproduced.

III. KLEIN-GORDON OSCILLATOR IN THE BACKGROUND OF A MAG-

NETIC COSMIC STRING IN A KALUZA-KLEIN THEORY

Now, let us consider the quantum dynamics of a particle moving in the magnetic cosmic

string background. In the Kaluza-Klein theory [2, 34, 35], the corresponding metrics with a

magnetic ﬂux passing along the symmetry axis of the string assumes the following form,

ds2 = −dt2 + dρ2 + α2ρ2dφ2 + dz2 +(cid:18)dx +

Φ

with cylindrical coordinates are used. The quantum dynamics is described by the equation

(2) with the following change in the inverse matrix tensor gµν,

in this way the equation (2) becomes,

(15)

with γ = −∂2
we can choose the following ansatz

t +∂2

z +∂2

Ψ = e−i(Et−kz−lφ−λx)R(ρ)

thus, the equation (15) transforms into

α2ρ2

+ M 2w2ρ2 − γ(cid:21)(cid:27) R(ρ) = 0

(16)

(17)

that with help of (16) the last term in the above equation is γ = E2 − M 2 − 2Mw − k2 − λ2.
After the change of variables x = Mwρ2, this equation takes the form

whose solution is given by R(x) = x

R(x) = 0,

which yields R(x) = e− x

R(x) = x

Substitution of this expression into equation (18) results in,

(20)

(21)

(22)

where γ is as before and β = l− λΦ/2π. Again this equation is in the same form as that one
describing the conﬂuent hypergeometric function xF ′′(x) + (c + 1 − x)F ′(x) − aF (x) = 0.
Requiring the convergence of the corresponding series, we arrive at the following condition

(23)

Using the respective expressions for β and γ and solving the resultant equation for E, we

obtain the following eigenvalues problems,

E2 = M 2 + 4Mw(cid:18)n + |l − λΦ/2π|

2α

+ 1(cid:19) + k2 + λ2

(24)

Comparatively to the case without magnetic ﬂux string in the center of defect, the angular

quantum number is shifted by the quantity related with the magnetic ﬁeld due to a presence

of Aharonov-Bohm ﬂux in a magnetic string. Additionally, we can see that the presence of

the defects breaks the degeneracy of the energy levels due to the presence of the curvature

source. Besides, in absence of magnetic ﬁelds, Φ = 0, the results of previous section are

obtained.

IV. KLEIN-GORDON OSCILLATOR IN COSMIC DISPIRATION BACKGROUND

IN A KALUZA-KLEIN THEORY

Now we investigate the Klein-Gordon oscillator in cosmic dispiration background in

Kaluza-Klein theory[2]. Let us study the concurrency between gravitational and electromag-

netic contributions due to the presence of this topological defect. In this way, we consider

8

the magnetic cosmic string with torsional sources besides of curvature and electromagnetic

ones. The corresponding background is described by the metric [2],

Now Λ = l − Jk − λΦ/2π and γ = E2 − M 2 − 2Mw − k2 − λ2. Making ξ = Mwρ2, this

An analysis of the divergence at the origin and inﬁnity suggest use of the following general

A solution for this equation is a polynomial of degree n in ξ of the form F (ξ) =P anξn.

We can see that this solution diverges for all values of n which represents the degree of

the hypergeometric series. This divergence is avoid by a truncation method in coeﬃcients

an.
If we assume that an = 0 for a ﬁnite numbers of terms in the polynomial series,
thus we guarantee normality of our solution in ξ to ξ → 0 and avoid the divergence to
ξ → ∞. Making a general expression for the coeﬃcients an, we conclude that to ensure this
integrability, we make a = −n. This is,

We have now an important result: all global parameters of the background appear in energy

levels, however this background can be locally ﬂat. The degeneracy of energy is absent due

to the presence of curvature and torsion sources. As pointed out previously, this result allows

us to compensate the torsion contribution by adjusting the magnetic ﬁeld appropriately, and

the medium becomes torsion-free.

V. KALUZA-KLEIN OSCILLATOR IN COSMIC DISLOCATION IN SOM-RAYCHAUDHURI

SPACETIME IN KALUZA-KLEIN THEORY

Recent observational data indicate the rotation as well as expansion of our universe.

This dynamics has called great attention to the establishment of a theory to describe these

scenarios. One of these theories was developed by G¨odel in the 1950 for an universe with

rigid rotation characterized by a term Ω in the metric and with curvature source known as

Weyssenhoﬀ-Raabe ﬂuid [48, 49]. Some studies of quantum dynamics in this spacetime were

carried out for a (3+1)-dimensional spacetimes [50–52]. In this section we consider a cosmic

dispiration in a ﬂat G¨odel solution or Som-Raychaudhuri solution in Kaluza-Klein theory.

We consider that the charged scalar particle is submitted to an uniform magnetic ﬁeld. This

ﬁeld is also introduced using the Kaluza-Klein theory via geometry of the spacetime. Due

10

to the importance of the rotation in actual scenarios, we can use the Kaluza-Klein theory to

describe the quantum dynamics of a Klein-Gordon particle in this spinning background. Let

us consider the Som-Raychaudhuri solution of the Einstein ﬁeld equation [49], extended to

Kaluza-Klein theory with a spinning, torsion source along the symmetry axis of background

spacetimes,

ds2 = −(dt + αΩρ2dφ)2 + dρ2 + α2ρ2dφ2 + (dz + Jdφ)2 +(cid:2)dx + (Φ/2π + eBρ2/2)dφ(cid:3)2(34)

Here Ω is associated with the rotational source of the space. It is easy to write the matrix

gµν(~r) and from it obtain gµν(~r) as below,

Initially we can see that in the absence of homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld as well as of

rotation sources, the results of the previous section are reproduced We can also see that the

external sources have an important role in the dynamics of our particle due to the explicit

dependence on these parameters. Assuming that the physical laws are true in any temporal

scales, we believe that the rotation, magnetic ﬁelds, curvature and torsion sources had played

an important role in the dynamics of our universe in early evolution epoch and, therefore,

our contribution have a interesting application.

It is important to study some limits. Let us consider the weak oscillator as well as rotation
free limit of spacetimes, which is equivalent to assume (w, Ω) → 0, into equation (39). After
some calculations, we obtain the following result,

that is exactly the result of equation (35) of the reference [1]. In the presence of rotation
and curvature sources, one can consider the limit (J, Φ, B, w) → 0 in (39). After a some
algebra we obtain the result

that is equivalent to energy levels in the G¨odel-type spacetimes studied by us [52]. Although

the Eq. (39) has a cumbersome form, some limits shows important results in describing other

simple physical systems with topological/electromagnetic interactions by simple manipula-

tion of that equation. Finally, we can see that the degeneracy of the energy levels, in this

case, is strongly broken due to the presence of curvature, torsion, magnetic ﬁelds as well as

the rotation source. It is important to observe a Landau structure in all previously studied

cases.

VI. SUMMARY

In this paper we studied the quantum dynamics of a Klein-Gordon particle interacting

with external ﬁeld sources, using the ﬁve-dimensional version of the General Relativity. The

quantum dynamics in the usual as well as magnetic cosmic string cases allows us to obtain the

energy levels and the eigenfunctions depending on the external parameters characterizing

the background spacetimes, a result known by gravitational analogue of the well studied

Aharonov-Bohm eﬀect.

We have investigated the Klein-Gordon oscillator in the cosmic string background in a

Kaluza-Klein theory and obtained the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of energy which turn

out to depend on the α parameter that characterizes the cosmic string. Note that in the

four-dimensional limit we recover the results found by Boumali et al.[30]. For the case of

Klein-Gordon oscillator in the presence of the magnetic ﬂux string in Kaluza-Klein theory,

we obtained that the energy levels depend on the Aharonov-Bohm ﬂux and the parameter

α. The Klein Gordon equation for KG oscillator in cosmic dispiration was investigated, and

the energy levels turn out to depend on α parameter, the dislocation parameter (Burgers

vector modulus) J and the Aharonov-Bohm ﬂux. The torsion inclusion has a important role

in this dynamics. By the results in this background, it becomes possible to compensate the

elastic contribution introduced by the topological defect, by a ﬁne tuning of the external

magnetic ﬁeld strength. The degeneracy of the energy levels is strongly broken due to the

presence of curvature and torsional sources in these expressions.

Finally, we have obtained the spectrum and wavefunction for Klein-Gordon oscillator in

the background of the cosmic string in a Som-Raychaudhury spacetime in Kaluza-Klein

theory in the presence of a uniform magnetic ﬁeld. We introduced the uniform magnetic

ﬁeld and Aharonov-Bohm ﬂux via Kaluza-Klein theory. Energy levels and eigenfunctions

were obtained. Note that in an appropriate limit we obtain the results of previous section
Ω 7−→ 0 B 7−→ 0, that is cosmic dispiration case. In the case where α = 1, Φ = 0 we
obtain the results to the ones of of Wang and collaborators [47]. In the limit of Ω = 0

the similar spectrum of the Landau levels is recovered.
