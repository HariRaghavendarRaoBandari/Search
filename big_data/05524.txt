Starting from a relativistic Lagrangian for pseudoscalar Goldstone bosons and vector mesons
in the antisymmetric tensor representation, a one-loop calculation is performed to pin down the
divergent structures that appear for the eﬀective low-energy action at chiral orders Q2 and Q4. The
corresponding renormalisation-scale dependences of all low-energy constants up to chiral order Q4
are determined. Calculations are carried out for both the pseudoscalar octet and the pseudoscalar
nonet, the latter in the framework of chiral perturbation theory in the limit of a large number of
colours.

INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY

Chiral perturbation theory (χPT) [1–5], the low-
energy incarnation of the non-perturbative aspects of the
standard model of particle physics, is based on a sepa-
ration of scales. This separation allows for systematic
power counting and qualiﬁes χPT as an eﬀective ﬁeld
theory. The dynamical (low-energy/soft) scale is pro-
vided by the masses of the lowest pseudoscalar multi-
plet, the Goldstone bosons. Their smallness is caused by
the smallness of the current quark masses of the lightest
(two or three) quark ﬂavours. To be more speciﬁc, the
spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry demands the
appearance of massless pseudoscalar Goldstone bosons.
The explicit breaking of chiral symmetry by the cur-
rent quark masses induces non-vanishing masses for these
pseudoscalars. But the masses are small as compared to
typical hadronic scales. The latter are related to the
scale ΛQCD where the strong interaction really becomes
strong, which in turn is caused by the scale anomaly of
the theory [6, 7].

Coming back to the scale separation, the static (high-
energy/hard) scale is given by the typical hadronic scales.
Conceptually it is useful to distinguish between diﬀerent
high-energy scales [8]. The “external” high-energy scale
is the energy where neglected degrees of freedom become
important. For chiral perturbation theory this scale is
at least given by the vector-meson mass mV ≈ 0.77 GeV
of the ω and ρ mesons [9, 10], if not by the mass of
the somewhat lighter σ meson [11]. The “intrinsic” high-
energy scale is given by the energy where loops become as
important as tree-level diagrams. For chiral perturbation
theory this scale is roughly at 4πFπ ≈ 1.2 GeV.

Conceptually the scale separation provides a clear-cut
power counting scheme if the momenta of the consid-
ered processes are on the order of the Goldstone-boson
masses. Expansions are carried out around the formal
limit where the considered momenta vanish along with
the Goldstone-boson masses. The latter takes place
in the chiral limit. When it comes to the real world
where the current quark masses do not vanish, it is clear
that the convergence of the expansions is the better the
smaller the dynamical scale is relative to the static scale.
For the two lightest quark ﬂavours there is a large scale

separation between the pion mass and corresponding mo-
menta at close-to-threshold processes on the one side and
the typical hadronic scales mentioned above on the other
side. Including strangeness, however, with a kaon mass
(dynamical scale) of about 500 MeV and a K∗ mass (de-
gree of freedom that is integrated out) of about 900 MeV,
the scales already move signiﬁcantly together [11].

Another formally clear-cut power counting scheme,
where however the numerical values for the dynamical
and the static scale gets even more intertwined, is χPT
for a large number of colours, Nc [12, 13]. In the com-
bined Nc → ∞ and chiral limit the mass of the η(cid:48) meson
vanishes [14, 15]. The pseudoscalar octet is enlarged to a
nonet. Systematic expansions in powers of 1/Nc, masses
of the nonet states and momenta become possible [16].
Schemes based on χPT and the large-Nc expansion [17–
19] lead to many phenomenologically appealing results in
spite of the fact that in the real world the mass of the η(cid:48)
is not at all lower than the masses of mesonic resonances
like the vector mesons. In the large-Nc limit one has the
ordering

η(cid:48) (cid:28) m2
m2

V (cid:28) (4πFπ)2 .

(1)

The ﬁrst quantity scales like 1/Nc [14, 15]. The mass of
a typical mesonic resonance, here the vector-meson mass
mV , scales like 1/N 0
c . Finally the scale where loops be-
come as important as tree-level processes, (4πFπ)2, scales
like Nc. In the real world (1) is contrasted by

m2

V < m2

η(cid:48) < (4πFπ)2 .

(2)

Nonetheless the large-Nc approximation provides many
insights in the dynamics of hadrons [12–19].

The previous discussions provide a motivation why one
might want to include additional degrees of freedom on
top of the Goldstone bosons. Before addressing the cen-
tral aspect of this work, the inclusion of vector mesons, it
is illuminating to discuss a better established case where
additional degrees of freedom have been included in the
framework of chiral perturbation theory, namely the case
of baryons [20]. As always one has to distinguish the two-
[5, 21–24] and three-ﬂavour [19, 25–30] case and it should
be clear that the scale separation and therefore the con-
vergence properties are better for the two-ﬂavour case.

But, in addition, it matters whether the scheme treats
the baryons relativistically [5, 19, 23, 24, 27–33] or non-
relativistically [21, 22, 25, 26] and whether [19, 21, 23–
26, 28] or not [5, 22, 27, 29, 30] the decuplet (for two
ﬂavours: the Delta iso-quartet) is included on top of the
ground-state baryon octet (for two ﬂavours: the nucleon
iso-doublet).

Before addressing these issues we should stress right
away that the inclusion of baryonic degrees of freedom
in a chiral eﬀective ﬁeld theory framework is conceptu-
ally much more straight forward than the inclusion of
(non-Goldstone) mesonic degrees of freedom (meson reso-
nances). Because of baryon number conservation a heavy
(static) scale — the baryon mass — remains in the con-
sidered process from beginning to end. The small (dy-
namical) scales are then given by the masses of the Gold-
stone bosons, the three-momenta of the involved parti-
cles and the mass diﬀerences between the baryon states.
In contrast, for a meson resonance one has to deal with
the fact that this resonance can decay into Goldstone
bosons.
If one treats the resonance mass as a heavy
(static) scale, like the baryon mass, then this implies that
the momenta of the emerging Goldstone bosons cannot
(all) be soft [34–37]. One suggestion to deal with this
problem is the hadrogenesis conjecture [38–44] where a
signiﬁcant mass gap is proposed between the J P = 0−,
1−, 1
ground states on the one hand and all
other large-Nc stable hadrons on the other hand.
In
this scheme the vector-meson mass constitutes a dynami-
cal/soft scale. Consequently all Goldstone bosons emerg-
ing from vector-meson decays have soft momenta. The
work presented here is fully compatible with the hadroge-
nesis conjecture, but is not restricted to it. In the present
work and in [45] we explore the quantitative impact of
one-loop contributions with dynamical vector mesons on
the low-energy eﬀective action and on the properties of
pseudoscalar mesons. Vector-meson masses and coupling
constants are adopted from phenomenology. The formal
power counting of the vector-meson mass will be of little
concern as we will fully integrate out the vector mesons.
We will come back to this point below after discussing
the case of baryon χPT.

In spite of the conceptual diﬀerence between the in-
clusion of baryons or mesons we want to use the bet-
ter established case of including baryonic degrees of free-
dom to discuss two issues relevant for both cases (meson
and baryon): First, connected to the previous discussion
around (1), (2), the issue how well or not well separated
the static and the dynamical scales actually are in prac-
tice. Second, the important technical issue how to deal
with loops that contain non-Goldstone bosons.

In the chiral limit one can ﬁnd a momentum regime
where only the ground-state baryons and the Goldstone
bosons are active degrees of freedom. In reality, however,
the mass diﬀerence between Delta and nucleon is not very
large [11]. In fact, in the combined chiral and large-Nc
limit (and ignoring electromagnetic eﬀects) the nucleon
and Delta become degenerate [17]. Thus it might make

2

sense to include the Deltas (and their ﬂavour partners) as
active degrees of freedom. Of course, this adds credits to
the central theme of this work, the inclusion of additional
degrees of freedom.

If baryons are included in chiral perturbation theory, it
turns out that the naive chiral power counting of loops is
spoiled by the appearance of the additional static scale,
the (average) baryon mass [20]. This problem will not
show up, if one treats the baryons non-relativistically
(heavy-baryon chiral perturbation theory).
In prin-
ciple, all contributions from a non-relativistic expan-
sion (Foldy-Wouthuysen expansion) of relativistic inter-
actions and propagators show up at appropriate orders
in the chiral power counting. In reality, however, it turns
out that often better results are obtained with a fully
relativistic framework, see, e.g., [5, 27, 30]. If the conver-
gence properties were excellent, this would not matter.
In reality it does to some extent, even for the case of two
ﬂavours.

In a relativistic setup there are in principle two pos-
sibilities how to deal with loop integrals: a) One splits
up each integral in two parts, one that is in accordance
with the chiral power counting and one that is not. The
latter is then disregarded. We note in passing that there
are several ways how to perform this splitting of integrals
[28, 31–33]. The quality of convergence might depend on
the way that one chooses [30]. The alternative, b) is to
keep the integrals as they are. As a consequence the in-
tegrals do not only contribute at the chiral order that is
formally assigned to them. Instead (polynomial parts of)
the integrals contribute to lower, i.e., more important or-
ders of the chiral expansion. Corresponding low-energy
constants from these lower orders serve to renormalise
the loops [20]. This is the approach that we follow in the
present work.

To summarise the discussion of baryon chiral pertur-
bation theory: The more separated the hard and soft
scales are, the less it matters how one includes heavy de-
grees of freedom. But the closer the scales move to each
other, the more problematic it might become to ignore
the loops with additional degrees of freedom or parts of
these loops. Consequently we will use in the present work
a fully relativistic framework and identify explicitly the
counter terms for the loop divergences irrespective of the
formal chiral order of the loops and counter terms.

While there is a clear gap between the masses of the
lightest pseudoscalar mesons and the masses of other
hadrons built from the lightest two quark ﬂavours, the
mass diﬀerence for the light vector mesons and the η me-
son is not that big anymore. The η(cid:48) meson is even heav-
ier than most of the vector mesons from the lowest-lying
multiplet. All this concerns the physical masses. On the
theory side there is one more situation where the dynam-
ical and the static scale move closer together: Still until
today a signiﬁcant part of lattice-QCD calculations deals
with too heavy “light” quark masses [46]. Therefore, it
is valid to discuss if and, if yes, which hadrons should
be included as additional degrees of freedom in an ex-

tended eﬀective theory. The lightest non-Goldstone bo-
son, the σ meson is a notoriously complicated state; see,
for instance, the discussion in [11] on low-lying scalars.
In addition, it is a very broad resonance. Thus its gen-
eral impact might be limited. On the other hand, the
low-lying vector mesons have both masses close to the
Goldstone-boson masses and small widths. Thus, they
are expected to be prominent in an eﬀective theory in-
cluding Goldstone bosons and other light mesons.

As already mentioned,

the inclusion of addional
mesonic degrees of freedom in an eﬀective theory is not
free of complications and/or input assumptions. Con-
cerning the scale separation one complication is caused
by the fact that numerically the masses of the vector
mesons are similar to the scale 4πFπ where loops be-
come as important as tree-level contributions, see (1),
(2). Here a possible solution could come from the resum-
mation of the numerically most important loop diagrams
[28, 43, 44, 47].

Another important issue is the representation depen-
dence. In principle it should not matter for an eﬀective
theory whether vector degrees of freedom are represented,
e.g., by ordinary vector ﬁelds, massive Yang-Mills ﬁelds,
hidden gauge ﬁelds or antisymmetric tensor ﬁelds; see,
for instance, the discussions in [48, 49]. However, the
explicit power counting, i.e., the classiﬁcation of inter-
action terms and diagrams might change when changing
the representation.

In the present work we have a much more modest
aim than setting up and/or checking the validity of a
power counting scheme for vector mesons. Here and in
the follow-up work [45] we will check the quantitative in-
ﬂuence of one-loop contributions with dynamical vector
mesons. We have chosen the antisymmetric tensor rep-
resentation based on its phenomenological success; see,
e.g., [2, 9, 50, 51]. The present work should be under-
stood as a feasibility study for one-loop calculations with
vector mesons in the antisymmetric tensor representa-
tion. In addition, we intend to scrutinise the eﬀective-
ﬁeld-theory assumption that at low — but practically rel-
evant! — energies the inﬂuence of vector mesons can fully
be accounted for by the low-energy constants of the chiral
Lagrangian. Starting out from a Lagrangian with vector
mesons one will obtain a non-local eﬀective action if one
integrates out the vector mesons and the ﬂuctuations in
the pseudoscalar ﬁelds. The local part of this eﬀective
action, i.e., the polynomial terms can be matched by an
adjustment of the low-energy constants. The non-local
part, related to the logarithms emerging from the loop
integrals, can only be matched, if it is further Taylor ex-
panded. However, if this part is numerically signiﬁcant,
the Taylor expansion might not converge very well and
jeopardise in that way the convergence of the chiral ex-
pansion. In the present work we address the cancellation
of one-loop divergences by the counter terms provided in
the form of the low-energy constants of χPT. Equipped
with the knowledge about these local structures we will
address in the follow-up work [45] the possible impor-

3

tance of the non-local logarithmic structures.

As already discussed,

the inclusion of additional
(mesonic) degrees of freedom in χPT is representation
dependent. Vector mesons can be described as vectors
or antisymmetric tensors or can be included via a hidden
local gauge mechanism [52]. As a glance of this repre-
sentation dependence we compare in this article our ﬁnal
results to those obtained from a hidden local gauge mech-
anism [52].

Aiming at a systematic inclusion of vector mesons
as active degrees of freedom in an eﬀective-ﬁeld-theory
framework we perform in the present work a feasibility
study concerning renormalisation aspects at the one-loop
level. We focus on the full eﬀective actions at chiral or-
der Q2 and Q4 where the vector mesons have been com-
pletely integrated out. This approach is complementary
to the explicit calculation of selected n-point functions as
carried out, for instance, in [53] for vector-meson proper-
ties or in [54, 55] for some low-energy constants of χPT.
Note that in the latter works not only vector mesons have
been considered and also additional assumptions about
the high-energy behaviour of resonance Lagrangians have
been made there. In the present work, we determine the
inﬁnity structure and the corresponding renormalisation-
scale dependence of all low-energy constants up to chiral
order Q4 that is needed to compensate the corresponding
eﬀects from loops that include vector mesons. The found
scale dependence should be qualitatively interpreted in
the following way: The ﬁnite parts of the loops with vec-
tor mesons depend on the masses of vector and pseu-
doscalar mesons, on the external momenta, and on the
renormalisation scale. For observables, (only) the scale
dependence is compensated by the one of the low-energy
constants. What is particularly interesting for observ-
ables is the impact of loops with vector mesons on the
momentum dependence. Concerning results of lattice
calculations also the impact on the quark-mass depen-
dence is of interest. Based on dimensional arguments, it
can be expected that at least part of the log µ2 depen-
dence which we uncover in the present work comes along
with a log s and/or log m2
P dependence of observables.
Here, µ denotes the renormalisation scale, s the square
of a generic external momentum, and mP the mass of a
pseudoscalar Goldstone boson. Detailed studies of these
dependences of observables are delegated to future works,
where one is already in progress [45].

We concentrate in the present work on the appearing
inﬁnities as deﬁned by a slightly modiﬁed MS-bar scheme
according to [3]. Technically we use non-perturbative
path-integral methods to keep the full chiral structure
of the eﬀective Lagrangian instead of just calculating
loops for speciﬁc n-point functions. In contrast to χPT
one-loop calculations as carried out in [2, 3], a standard
heat-kernel technique cannot be used for vector mesons
represented by antisymmetric tensor ﬁelds since these
ﬁelds contain frozen, non-propagating degrees of freedom
which have a diﬀerent short-distance behaviour than the
active, propagating degrees of freedom. This is an un-

fortunate ﬁnding because the standard heat-kernel tech-
nique keeps in every step the full chiral structure of the
eﬀective action and brings along recursive relations which
simplify and systematise the calculations when proceed-
ing from one chiral order to the next. We regard it as
illuminating to devote a subsection to the discussion of
this not-working technique before we present a formal-
ism that does work and serves to isolate and classify the
inﬁnities of the loop calculations. The calculations are
involved but a viable cross check emerges from the fact
that the full chiral structure needs to be reconstructed
in the end from several distinct expressions.
In other
words, the elegance of the heat-kernel technique of [2, 3]
concerning the full chiral structure is lost, but technically
a powerful cross check of the results has been gained.

Given that the calculations are rather involved we have
decided for this exploratory work that we limit the pos-
sible interaction terms between vector mesons and low-
energy degrees of freedom. We only consider the (chi-
ralised) three-ﬂavour versions of the phenomenologically
well known ρ-2π and ρ-v couplings where v denotes an ex-
ternal vector source. Other interaction terms that might
be relevant for a full eﬀective theory of pseudoscalar
and vector mesons are presented and discussed, e.g., in
[42, 51].

The article is organised in the following way. In sec-
tion II the building blocks and pertinent Lagrangians
for pseudoscalar and vector mesons are introduced.
It
is discussed how one-loop contributions in this frame-
work are calculated. Hereby, approaches for calculating
one-loop contributions with vector mesons which are not
applicable are discussed as well. The calculation itself is
split up into two parts: At ﬁrst, in section III we discuss
one-loop contributions for χPT plus vector mesons and
their inﬂuence on the low-energy constants of χPT for
the case where one includes only the pseudoscalar Gold-
stone octet. Afterwards, the calculations are extended
by including the η-singlet as well (section IV). All calcu-
lations are carried out up to (including) chiral order Q4.
In the last section, an outlook is given.

II. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS

In this section, techniques used to calculate the one-
loop contributions of light vector mesons are introduced.
We will also document (in subsections II B and II C)
methods which were tested in order to calculate the one-
loop contributions but turned out to be intractable.

Although in the classical sense eﬀective theories are
non-renormalisable, they can be renormalised order by
order. In pure χPT, a diagram containing n loops is at
least suppressed by order Q2n for a typical momentum Q
according to general power counting arguments [1–3]. To
calculate diagrams up to O(Q4) in pure χPT, both tree-
level diagrams based on the leading-order (LO) and next-
to-leading-order (NLO) Lagrangian and loop diagrams
based only on the LO Lagrangian have to be involved. In

4

[2, 3], the one-loop contributions to the eﬀective action
were calculated using the pure χPT-Lagrangian describ-
ing pseudoscalar ﬁelds only. Based on the techniques
used therein, one-loop contributions including light vec-
tor mesons are calculated in this article. Thereby, the
calculations are ﬁrst restricted to the pseudoscalar octet,
the singlet is only included in section IV. These calcu-
lations are a feasibility check for loop calculations based
on a Lagrangian that includes vector mesons (in the an-
tisymmetric tensor representation).

In this article, the χPT power-counting scheme is used,
i.e., both derivates and pseudoscalar masses are treated
as soft while the vector masses are not,

∂µ, mP ∈ O(Q), mV ∈ O(1).

(3)

Thus the eﬀective action will not contain vector mesons.
They are fully integrated out.

In the following we will perform one-loop calculations
based on the LO Lagrangian of χPT and on a vector-
meson Lagrangian to be speciﬁed below. We focus in the
present work on those inﬁnities where the counter terms
are provided by the low-energy constant of the χPT La-
grangians of LO, O(Q2), and NLO, O(Q4). Those La-
grangians are given by [3]

Note that the chiralised “free” Lagrangian Lfree does
contain interactions encoded in the chirally covariant
derivative. The interactions between vector mesons and
low-energy degrees of freedom are limited to V -2P and V -
v couplings with vector mesons V , pseudoscalar mesons
P and an external vector source v, as already discussed
in the introduction. These couplings describe the most
prominent ways of interactions of vector mesons with
pseudoscalar mesons. In particular, if one probes pions
by the electromagnetic interaction, the pion form factor
receives signiﬁcant contributions from an intermediate ρ-
meson, see, e.g., [51, 56] and references therein. The
next most signiﬁcant terms, the 2V -P coupling [41, 51]
and the mass splitting of the vector-meson masses [41, 42]
are not part of the present feasibility study. Note that
the notation used within this article follows the one used

The ﬁrst integral describes tree-level diagrams up to
O(Q4) only so that it has to be evaluated at the classical
solution ¯U for pseudoscalar ﬁelds determined through the
equation of motion (EOM) of the LO-χPT Lagrangian
L LO
χPT. Hereby, the vector-meson ﬁelds are treated as
pure ﬂuctuations, i.e., they do not contribute to the clas-
sical ﬁelds. The integral measure dµ denotes an integral
over the pseudoscalar and vector ﬁelds U (x) and Vµν(x),
respectively.

To calculate the one-loop approximation, the ﬁeld U is

expanded around its classical solution ¯U as [3]

U = ¯u expiξ ¯u,

¯U = ¯u2,

(10)

whereby ξ is a traceless, hermitian matrix. Treating in
addition the vector-meson ﬁelds V as ﬂuctuations yields a
combined ﬂuctuation vector ˆξ = (ξ, V )t. Therewith, L1
can be expanded in the neighbourhood of the classical
solution ¯U . In that way, we deﬁne the matrix operator
D via

(12)

The one-loop contribution can be expressed in terms of
D and, up to an irrelevant constant, is given by

Since the vector-meson ﬁelds are treated as pure ﬂuctua-
tions, the one-loop contribution depends only on the clas-
sical pseudoscalar ﬁelds and on external sources. Thus,
all singularities therein have to have the structure of
terms in the pure χPT-Lagrangians and have to renor-
malise the low-energy constants therein such that the
one-loop approximation for Z is ﬁnite.
In the present
χPT and L NLO
work we restrict ourselves to L LO
χPT .

A. Determining the matrix D for a general

Lagrangian

If one-loop contributions are calculated using Eq. (12),
the matrix D deﬁned according to Eq. (11) is needed. It

can be determined by expanding an action Z=(cid:82) d4xL at

the classical ﬁelds ¯U . Let Z be a general action depending
on ﬁelds Ai, i=1, . . . , n for a given n ∈ N. Then, the
EOM of a ﬁeld Aj reads as

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12){Ai}={ ¯Ai}

0 =

∂Z
∂Aj

for all j=1, . . . , n. Hereby, { ¯Ai} denotes the classical
ﬁelds. With the EOM, the action can be expanded and
the matrix operator D determined according to (integra-
tions are implicit)

Z[{Ai}] = Z[{ ¯Ai}] − 1

(13)

B. Expanding the one-loop contribution in powers

of pseudoscalar and other external ﬁelds

In general, one is not only interested in how the low-
energy constants are renormalised by the one-loop con-
tribution including light vector mesons but also in their
inﬂuence on observables like the pseudoscalar masses and
decay constants (see further work by the same authors
[45]). Thus, one might wonder whether one can deter-
mine the renormalisation of (some of) the low-energy
constants by just calculating two-point functions, i.e.,
by expanding the one-loop functional up to second or-
der in classical ﬁelds and/or external sources. However,
there are several chiral structures up to O(Q4) which
contribute in the same way to (onshell) two-point func-
tions. Therefore, only linear combinations of low-energy
constants are related in this way to the inﬁnities emerg-
ing from loops with vector mesons. To disentangle the
impact of the loops on the various low-energy constants,
one has to keep the complete chiral structure encoded in
the ﬁeld U instead of expanding in powers of the ﬁelds.

C. Heat-kernel approach

6

Since the one-loop calculation including light vector
mesons seems to be similar to the calculation with pseu-
doscalar mesons only, one could try to follow [2, 3] using a
heat-kernel approach. In general, for using a heat-kernel
approach a matrix D according to the deﬁnition in Eq.
(11) is considered. This matrix has to fulﬁl the condi-
tion D → D0 ∼ (cid:3) + (mass)2 in the limit of no external
ﬁelds. Here and in the following, the phrase “limit of no
external ﬁelds” refers to the classical solution ¯u ≡ 1, the
scalar source s ≡ M and all other external sources set
to zero. Therewith, the matrix elements in d dimensions
can be expressed as [2, 57]

(16)
Therefore, only H2(x|x) has to be determined to iden-
tify the inﬁnite contribution for the physical number of
dimensions, d=4. It can be determined using the diﬀer-
ential equation for H(x|λ|y) which is generated by taking
the derivative of the matrix element with respect to λ,

(cid:10)x(cid:12)(cid:12)e−λD(cid:12)(cid:12) y(cid:11) = −Dx

(cid:10)x(cid:12)(cid:12)e−λD(cid:12)(cid:12) y(cid:11) ,

∂
∂λ

and the initial condition H(x|0|x)=H0(x|x)=1. This
diﬀerential equation yields recursive relations for the
Hn(x|y) which can be used to calculate H2(x|x).

For loops including vector mesons in the antisymmetric
tensor representation, the corresponding matrix D does
not have the required standard form (cid:3) + (mass)2 in the
limit of no external ﬁelds. However, a projection on the
space of antisymmetric rank-2 tensors can be performed

(cf. subsection III A for details on this projection) such
that the vector ﬁelds are decomposed into a propagating
mode and a non-propagating mode. I.e., in the limit of
no external ﬁelds, the matrix D is equal to (cid:3) + (mass)2
if acting on the propagating mode and equal to (mass)2
only if acting on the non-propagating mode. It turns out
that due to the non-standard form of the matrix D act-
ing on the non-propagating mode a heat-kernel approach
is not applicable. This is discussed in greater detail in
appendix A where the heat-kernel approach is applied to
a toy Lagrangian with only one vector-meson ﬂavour.

D. Calculating one-loop contributions in powers of

D−D0

The heat-kernel method of [3] is very elegant in provid-
ing a closed form H2 for the divergences in four dimen-
sions and in keeping chirally covariant structure through-
out the calculation. In lack of this method, we have to
resort to a more direct brute force approach. As we will
see, this requires at some point a derivative expansion
of a non-local expression with the aim of obtaining a
local eﬀective action. The ordinary derivatives that ap-
pear in this way must be fused in the end with the ap-
propriate ﬁelds to obtain the pertinent chirally invariant
structures that ﬁt the Lagrangians of χPT. This painful
book-keeping procedure can, on the other hand, be seen
as an important cross check of our calculations. It is a
highly non-trivial check if several separately non-chiral
terms fuse to chirally invariant structures.

To determine divergences in four dimensions, the cal-
culation of one-loop contributions via an expansion in
δD:=D−D0 is discussed in this subsection. Hereby, D0
denotes again the matrix D in the limit of no external
ﬁelds. Using D=D0+δD, the one-loop contribution can
be rewritten as

Zone loop =

Hereby, D−1
0 denotes both the matrix in coordinate space
and the corresponding one in momentum space. How-
ever, it is always clear from the context which one is
used.

7

As a ﬁrst step, derivatives acting on δ-functions which
show up in δD (see determination of Dvec, Dpseudo and
Dmix in the following sections) have to be evaluated,
η δ(x − y) = −eiky (ikη + ∂η) A(y) .

d4x eikxA(x)∂x

(cid:90)

(19)

Next, the multidimensional space integral has to be lo-
calised, i.e., expanded around one space coordinate, e.g.,
around x1 =: x with xi =: x−zi for i (cid:54)= 1 and

A(xi) = A(x − zi) =

Since ∂ ∈ O(Q), this Taylor expansion can be approxi-
mated by a ﬁnite series if calculating tr(log D) to a given
order in Q. Note that at this point the ordinary deriva-
tives appear which have to be fused with appropriate
ﬁelds in the end to obtain chirally invariant structures.
If the integrand is proportional to the exponential eikzi
for a given momentum k and space point zi after the
transformation above, it will not be proportional to the
exponential eikzj for the same momentum k and another
space point zj (cid:54)= zi. Furthermore, no exponential func-
tion in the integrand depends on the expansion point x.
Thus, after the transformation

To identify the inﬁnite part of the momentum inte-
gral, dimensional regularisation is used, i.e., the integral
in momentum space is calculated in (4+2ε) instead of
four dimensions. Its integrand can be further simpliﬁed
containing one propagator with a common mass instead
of several propagators with separate masses using Feyn-
man parameters [7],

for a small ε ∈ R, α ∈ N0 and β ∈ N. The ﬁnite part
consists of terms of O(1) and terms of O(ε) which vanish
for ε→0. The function f : R2 → R depends only on the
mass m and the combination (α−β) but not on ε. Indeed,
f (•, α−β) ≡ 0 for (β−α) ≥ 3, i.e., the integral is ﬁnite.
The renormalisation scale µ is introduced by dimensional
regularisation. Note that all physical observables have to
be independent of the scale µ.
Furthermore, if an integrand of the form given in the
integral above is multiplied with kµ1 ··· kµn , the integral
will be zero for all odd n ∈ N. Otherwise, the multipli-
cand can be substituted by [6]

and accordingly for n > 4, n even.

In section B in the appendix, an integral is calculated
as an example for the procedure described in this subsec-
tion.

III. ONE-LOOP CONTRIBUTIONS INCLUDING

VECTOR MESONS UP TO O(Q4)

In this section, the one-loop contribution including vec-
tor mesons are calculated up to O(Q4) (subsections III B-
III D). The calculation method is based on the techniques
discussed in subsection II D. Furthermore, the results are
used to renormalise the low-energy constants of the LO-
and NLO-χPT Lagrangians (4) (see subsection III E).

For ﬂuctuations both in the pseudoscalar and in the
vector-meson ﬁelds as considered in this article, the ma-
trix D can be written as a block matrix such that

(23)

Using this block structure, equation (17) which expresses
the one-loop contribution as a sum over D0 and δD with
D=D0 + δD can be split up into parts containing or not
containing Dmix, respectively,

tr(log D) = tr(log Dvec) + tr(log Dpseudo) +

=: tr(log Dvec) + tr(log Dpseudo) + tr(log D)mix.

The diﬀerent parts of this sum are calculated separately
in subsections III B - III D. First, the one-loop contribu-
tion from Dvec is calculated, then the additional contri-
bution from Dpseudo and at last the contributions con-
taining Dmix. Thereby, all calculations are performed up
to O(Q4). Furthermore, the projection on the space of
antisymmetric rank-2 tensors necessary in order to deter-
mine D0
vec is discussed in the following subsection III A.

A. Projection on the space of antisymmetric

rank-2 tensors

As discussed in subsection II D, the limit D0 for no
external ﬁelds has to be determined in order to calculate
the one-loop contribution. If the matrix D is written as
a block matrix, this limit has to be determined for all
block-matrix parts separately. As already calculated in
[3], D0
mix = 0.

Since Dvec is generated by the parts in the Lagrangian
containing two vector meson ﬁelds, it is generated by
Lfree only. Hereby, the matrix Dvec is twice the deﬁnition
in Eq. (13) in order to simplifying further calculations.
This only adds a constant to tr(log Dvec) and, hence, does
not change the ﬁnal result. In the following, the matrices
Dpseudo and Dmix are determined in the same way.

Since the vector meson ﬁelds Vµν are antisymmetric ten-

ﬁelds without changing the result of tr(log Dvec). There-
fore, the antisymmetric projection operators in momen-

each component of E and G, respectively, is given by a
trace over 3 × 3 matrices. If the traces in ﬂavour space
in Qvec
are rewritten component-by-component, the in-
volved traces of 3 × 3 matrices can be calculated using

The part acting on vector ﬁelds is multiplied with D0

to the form in which the NLO Lagrangian L NLO
χPT is dis-
played there. The contributions from Dvec renormalise
the low-energy constants L1, L2, L3, L9, L10 and H1 of
the NLO-χPT Lagrangian (see subsection III E).

C. Result for tr(log Dpseudo)

Dpseudo is generated by terms in the Lagrangian pro-
portional to ξ2. As will be shown in the following, all
three parts of the Lagrangian, LχPT, Lfree and Llin,
can contribute to Dpseudo. The contribution generated
only by LχPT was already calculated in [3]. We have
used these results to successfully check our calculation
method. However, this calculation is not presented in
this article.

The Lagrangians Lfree and Llin do not directly depend
on the matrix U describing the pseudoscalar ﬁelds but on
U . However, the expansion rule (10)
the matrix u =
for expanding U at its classical solution ¯U cannot be
reformulated easily as an expansion rule for u. Therefore,
the vector ﬁelds V are rewritten such that Lfree and Llin

depend on U directly by introducing the ﬁelds (cid:101)V :=uV u†.
In terms of (cid:101)V , the free vector Lagrangian reads as

both the Lagrangian Lfree and Llin. Since there are no
terms involving Dmix in the ﬁrst term (N =1) of the series

loop contributions up to O(Q4). Additionally, Dmix → 0

In Fig. 1, the renormalised constant Fr(µ) is plot-
ted as a function of the scale µ assuming that the
value F =92 MeV is reproduced for µ0=mV =0.776 GeV.
Hereby, two diﬀerent values for both the parameter hP
and the vector meson decay constant fV are used. On
the one hand, hP has been determined from decays of
light vector mesons into two pseudoscalar mesons in
[41]5, hP =1.50. On the other hand, the KSFR relation
FV =2GV [48] yielding hP =2 is used (see also Tab. I).
The vector-meson decay constant is either approximated
2 · 92 MeV [48].
by fV =150 MeV [51] or by fV =
Note that Fr(µ) becomes imaginary for too small values
of µ. In general, Fig. 1 displays a quite drastic renormal-
isation scale dependence of Fr(µ). Also the dependence
on the actual values for the vector-meson coupling con-
stants hP and fV is rather signiﬁcant. To which extent all
this carries over, for instance, to a vector-meson loop in-
duced quark-mass dependence of the pseudoscalar decay
constants remains to be seen [45]; see the corresponding
discussion in section I.

the low-energy constants “const” such that Z is ﬁnite

energy constants (const)r. We have the following low-

and the corresponding renormalisation scale dependence
of the low-energy constants are not directly related to ob-
servables. Nonetheless a strong dependence might pro-
vide a ﬁrst hint on possible momentum and/or quark-
mass dependences of observables. Therefore we will de-
termine how much the low-energy constants change nu-
merically if the renormalisation point is varied within a
reasonable range. We will compare this spread with the
corresponding absolute size of the respective low-energy
constant as determined from phenomenology.

Before addressing this issue at the end of this section
we want to highlight the opposite aspect, the fact that
the low-energy constants are not observables. One result
that points to this fact is the ﬁnding that the choice of
diﬀerent representations for the vector mesons leads to a
diﬀerent renormalisation of the low-energy constants. To
display this issue we compare our results with the ones
based on the hidden local gauge formalism (HLG) [52].

In Tab. II we provide the numerical values for the
renormalisation coeﬃcients Γi/2 and ∆i/2 as generated
by pure pseudoscalar loops and for Λi and ηi caused
by loops including vector mesons. As one can see, the
renormalisation coeﬃcients are very sensitive to the ac-
tual choice of the parameters hP and fV . Whenever non-
vanishing the renormalisation coeﬃcients from pure pseu-
doscalar loops and from loops including vector mesons
are comparable in absolute size except for the quantities
L10 and H1. We have not found a deeper reason for this
fact, but we note that these are the quantities that con-
tain two ﬁeld-strength tensors of the external vector and
axial-vector sources. In HLG a much larger renormali-
sation eﬀect can be observed for some of the low-energy
constants. This stresses again the representation depen-
dence of the results for non-observable quantities like the
low-energy constants. If these diﬀerences have any im-
pact on observables remains to be seen.

Finally we introduce the renormalisation-scale depen-

dence (variation) of the NLO low-energy constants by

Comparing to the contributions from pure pseu-
doscalar loops [3] shows that L6 is only renormalised by
loops emerging from the pure χPT-Lagrangian while L3
and L7 are only renormalised by loops from Lagrangians
containing vector mesons. Before looking at the numer-
ical results we stress again that the divergence structure

compared to the phenomenologically determined values
for the low-energy constants based on pure χPT [3, 59].
We observe that the changes caused by varying the renor-

IV. ONE-LOOP CONTRIBUTIONS UP TO O(Q4)

INCLUDING THE η-SINGLET

In the calculations presented so far, the Goldstone-
boson octet described by the matrix Φ (cf. Eq. (5)) was
used i.e., the physical η-meson was approximated by the
(unphysical) octet state η8. If the η(cid:48)-meson is included
additionally, the Goldstone-boson nonet with the singlet
state φ0 has to be considered, i.e.,

Φ (cid:55)→ Φoctet +

φ0 1 .

A formally systematic framework for the low-energy
eﬀective theory of the pseudoscalar nonet is χPT for a
large number of colours [16]. There the LO large-Nc χPT
Lagrangian is given by7

µ1=0.5 GeV and µ2=1 GeV. The results are compared
to the phenomenologically determined values for the
low-energy constants [3, 59]. All values are given in

units of 10−3.

In the power counting of large-Nc χPT the “NLO” La-
grangian in (4) contains NLO terms and terms of next-
to-next-to-leading order (N2LO). In addition, the NLO
Lagrangian of large-Nc χPT receives additional contribu-
tions [16]. To cancel the inﬁnities of one-loop diagrams
including vector mesons we will need parts of the LO,
NLO and N2LO Lagrangians of large-Nc χPT. Instead
of writing down all these Lagrangians we restrict our-
selves to the terms that are needed for the renormalisa-
tion of the loops including vector mesons. These terms
are covered by (4), (59) and

Hereby, M± and α± denote a combination of pion mass

In [16], the changes in the renormalisa-
tion of the low-energy constants caused by adding the
η-singlet to the pure χPT-Lagrangian have been deter-
mined. They are not repeated in this article.

For the calculation of tr(log D) containing Dmix in-

cluding the η-singlet, note that (cid:101)∆a0 = 0 for all vector-

meson ﬂavors a = 0, . . . , 8 as already mentioned in sub-
section III D. Furthermore, the non-zero terms including

Additionally, if using α++α−=1 the only diﬀerence for

P ) ∼(cid:10)M(ϑt·ϑ)(cid:11) +(cid:10)(mass part of Fχ)(ϑt·ϑ)(cid:11)

is visible in terms containing the pseudoscalar masses
explicitly. For calculations without the η-singlet, the only
terms containing these masses explicitly are

Qmix

with ϑ and Fχ as deﬁned in Eq. (45) and (47), respec-
tively. However, inserting D+η(cid:48)
pseudo into the equations for
those terms yields the same result with the mass matrix
M and the corresponding part in Fχ modiﬁed according
to (62). Therefore, the sum of these two terms vanishes
both for the calculation with and without the η-singlet.
same up to ﬁnite parts and terms of O(Q6) for both not
including and including the η-singlet. Thus we are back
to the same expression as given in (46).

Hence, the parts containing Dmix in tr(log (cid:101)D) are the

However, the ﬁnal results of subsection III D have been
obtained by using the EOM (49) emerging from the LO
Lagrangian. In the presence of the singlet ﬁeld and in
particular due to the eﬀect from the topological suscep-
tibility the EOM changes to

The results from the previous section are modiﬁed and
extended in the following way: The results for the renor-
malisation of all the previously introduced low-energy
constants remains the same except for L7 which now
does not receive any renormalisation.
In addition, the
new low-energy constants τ and ˜Λ2 receive the following

V. OUTLOOK

In the present work, the inﬁnity structure and corre-
sponding renormalisation-scale dependence of all χPT-
low-energy constants up to chiral order Q4 have been
determined. Thereby, the ﬁnite parts of the loops with
vector mesons depend in addition on the masses of vector
and pseudoscalar mesons and on the external momenta.
It is therefore interesting how physical observables de-
pend on these. In the follow-up work [45] we will study
the inﬂuence of loops with vector mesons on the pseu-
doscalar properties (mass and decay constant) within the
same framework as used in the present work.

Furthermore, a plausibility check of the counting
scheme with both light pseudoscalar and vector mesons
as degrees of freedom as suggested in [42] can be per-
formed. Therein, vector mesons are counted as soft, i.e.,
the vector meson mass mV is of chiral order Q. There-
fore, one-loop diagrams of O(Q4) could have a chiral
structure of O(Q6) divided by m2
V . Since the correspond-
ing inﬁnities would have no counter terms in the NLO-
χPT Lagrangian of O(Q4), all these inﬁnities either have
to vanish directly or for speciﬁc parameter combinations
within a reasonable framework. Note that such a plausi-
bility check has to be performed for the full Lagrangian
given in [42] and not only for the restricted Lagrangian as
used in this work. Additionally, calculations with vector
mesons as non-vanishing classical ﬁelds and the renormal-
isation of parameters in an NLO Lagrangian with vector
mesons is of interest.

Appendix A: Heat-kernel calculation for a toy model

with only one charged vector meson

In subsection II C, the heat-kernel approach is dis-
cussed and that it is not applicable to Lagrangians with
vector mesons represented by antisymmetric tensor ﬁelds.
Here, the heat-kernel approach is tried to be applied to
a vector-meson Lagrangian. It is discussed in greater de-
tail why such a procedure is not applicable. For that,
consider a toy Lagrangian for one complex vector-meson

both mass and kinetic term. First, the equation of mo-

Since T (cid:54)= 0 by deﬁnition and (x, y) are arbitrary,

H0(x|y) = 0 .

However, this result is contrary to the initial condition

H0(x|y) = 1 + O(x − y).

Therefore, the heat-kernel approach is not applicable for
the toy Lagrangian Ltoy for one vector meson. The same
procedure can be applied to the full Lagrangian Lvec for
vector mesons yielding that a heat-kernel approach is not
applicable.

8 Recall from subsection II C that only H2 is needed to identify

the inﬁnities for d=4 dimensions.

contribution in powers of δD=D−D0 is described in sub-
section II D. In this section, an integral contributing to
the second term in the sum (17) for tr(log D) is deter-
mined as an example for such an calculation. Thereby, a

First, the term proportional to kη is calculated. For that,
the integral is localised, i.e., y =: x − z and ζ(y) is ex-
panded at z=0 up to O(Q4),

Thereby, the ﬁrst term in the expansion of ζ yields zero
due to the odd number of k’s. For the second term,
the integration over d4z can be performed after partial
integration with respect to z as described in subsection

yielding the δ-function δ(k − p) in momentum space. So,
the resulting integral over one space coordinate x and
