ABSTRACT

Aims. We carried out optical polarimetry of an isolated cloud, Gal 110-13, to map the plane-of-the-sky magnetic
ﬁeld geometry. The main aim of the study is to understand the most plausible mechanism responsible for the unusual
cometary shape of the cloud in the context of its magnetic ﬁeld geometry.
Methods. When unpolarized starlight passes through the intervening interstellar dust grains that are aligned with their
short axes parallel to the local magnetic ﬁeld, it gets linearly polarized. The plane-of-the-sky magnetic ﬁeld component
can therefore be traced by doing polarization measurements of background stars projected on clouds. Because the light
in the optical wavelength range is most eﬃciently polarized by the dust grains typically found in the outer layers of the
molecular clouds, optical polarimetry enables us to trace the magnetic ﬁeld geometry of the outer layers of the clouds.
Results. We made R-band polarization measurements of 207 stars in the direction of Gal 110-13. The distance of Gal 110-
13 was determined as ∼ 450 ± 80 pc using our polarization and 2MASS near-infrared data. The foreground interstellar
contribution was removed from the observed polarization values by observing a number of stars located in the vicinity
of Gal 110-13 which has Hipparcos parallax measurements. The plane-of-the-sky magnetic ﬁeld lines are found to be
well ordered and aligned with the elongated structure of Gal 110-13. Using structure function analysis, we estimated
the strength of the plane-of-the-sky component of the magnetic ﬁeld as ∼ 25µG.
Conclusions. Based on our results and comparing them with those from simulations, we conclude that compression by
the ionization fronts from 10 Lac is the most plausible cause of the comet-like morphology of Gal 110-13 and of the
initiation of subsequent star formation.

1. Introduction

Gal 110-13, also known as LBN 534 or DG 191, is an iso-
lated, unusually elongated, comet-shaped molecular cloud
located at the galactic coordinate l = 110◦ & b = −13◦.
The cloud belongs to the Andromeda constellation. First
recognized by Whitney (1949), the Gal 110-13 cloud con-
sists of a blue reﬂection nebula, vdB 158, located at the
southern end of the cloud, which is illuminated by a B-
type star, HD 222142. Based on the spectroscopic par-
allaxes determined for HD 222142 and another B-type
star, HD 222086, Aveni & Hunter (1969) derived a dis-
tance of 440±100 pc to the cloud. Using 100µm IRAS data,
Odenwald & Rickard (1987) identiﬁed and listed 15 isolated
clouds that showed cometary or ﬁlamentary morphology.
The remarkable comet-like morphology of Gal 110-13 makes
it one of the most unusual and isolated clouds in the list by
Odenwald & Rickard (1987). The cloud major axis, which
is ∼ 1◦ in extent, is oriented at a position angle of ∼ 45◦ to
the east with respect to the north. The cloud has a width
of ∼ 8′.

Odenwald et al. (1992) made a detailed study of Gal
110-13 multiwavelength observations. They found the
cloud, especially the tail part, to be highly clumpy in na-
ture. They explored possible mechanisms (such as the in-

teraction of the cloud with ionization fronts or supernova
remnants, gravitational instability, hydrodynamics process
involving gas stripping, and the cloud-cloud collision) that
could explain the unusual shape of the cloud. Of these,
according to Odenwald et al. (1992), the cloud-cloud col-
lision mechanism was considered to be the most plausible
one. Gal 110-13 is explained to have formed as a conse-
quence of collision between two interstellar clouds whose
compression zone resulted in the elongated far-IR and 12CO
emission detected from the cloud. However, because Gal
110-13 is roughly pointing toward the Lac OB association,
Lee & Chen (2007) suggest that the present morphology of
the cloud could also be explained by its interaction with su-
pernova blast waves or ionization fronts from the massive
members of the Lac OB association. A comet-like morphol-
ogy of clouds is formed when a supernova explosion shocks
a pre-existing spherical cloud and compresses it to form the
head, and the blast wave drives the material mechanically
away from the supernova to form the tail (Brand et al.,
1983). Reipurth (1983) suggested that the UV radiation
from massive stars photoionizes a pre-existing spherical
cloud, and shock fronts compress it to form the head. The
tail is formed either from the eroded material of the cloud or
the pre-existing medium protected from the UV radiation
because of the shadowing of the tail by the head.

In
recent years, a number of studies have been conducted
to address the role played by the magnetic ﬁeld in the
cloud-cloud collision scenario (e.g., Marinho et al., 2001)
and in the external
ionization-induced evolution of an
isolated globule (e.g., Henney et al., 2009). In both these
processes, the magnetic ﬁeld seems to alter the results
from the hydrodynamical evolution signiﬁcantly.

2001; Kessel-Deynet & Burkert,

1989; Bertoldi & McKee,

(Bertoldi,

Based on 3D-smoothed particle magnetohydrodynam-
ics simulations (3D-SPMHD, Marinho et al., 2001), it was
shown that in a cloud-cloud collision scenario the clump
formation is only possible in the case where the collision
happens between two identical spherical clouds that are
traveling parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld orientation. After
the collision, the ﬁeld lines are found to be chaotic on the
cloud scale (∼few pc) though a coherence in the ﬁeld dis-
tribution was found on the clump scale (. 0.5 pc). The
evolution of globules under the inﬂuence of ionizing radia-
tion from an external source was studied using 3D-radiation
magnetohydrodynamics simulations (Henney et al., 2009;
Mackey & Lim, 2011). The studies show that a strong
(∼ 150 − 180µG) initially uniform magnetic ﬁeld perpen-
dicular to the direction of the ionizing radiation remained
unchanged, thus altering the dynamical evolution of the
globule signiﬁcantly from the non-magnetic case. In con-
trast, weak or medium, initially perpendicular magnetic
ﬁeld lines are swept into alignment with the direction of
the ionization radiation and the long axis of the glob-
ule during the evolution. The magnetic ﬁeld parallel to
the direction of the ionizing radiation, however, are found
to remain unchanged producing a broader and snubber
globule head. Irrespective of the initial magnetic ﬁeld ori-
entation, the ﬁeld lines are found to be ordered well in
the external radiation-induced evolution of globules. Such
well-ordered magnetic ﬁeld lines are observed in a number
of cometary globules (e.g., Sridharan et al., 1996; Bhatt,
1999; Bhatt et al., 2004; Targon et al., 2011; Soam et al.,
2013). Therefore, we expect that the geometry of the mag-
netic ﬁeld lines in Gal 110-13 provide useful information on
the possible mechanism that might have been responsible
for forming the cloud.

Observations of polarized radiation in the interstellar
medium at optical-through-millimeter wavelengths have
been attributed to extinction by, and emission from,
interstellar dust grains (Hiltner, 1949, 1951; Hildebrand,
1988). The polarization measurements in optical (e.g.,
Vrba et al., 1976; Goodman et al., 1990; Alves et al.,
2008; Soam et al., 2013; Alves et al., 2014), near-infrared

geometry of molecular clouds. Optical polarization position
angles trace the plane of the sky orientation of the ambient
magnetic ﬁeld at the periphery of the molecular clouds
(with AV ∼ 1-2 mag; Goodman et al., 1995; Goodman,
1996). In this work, we present the optical polarization
measurements of 207 stars projected on Gal 110-13 to map
the projected magnetic ﬁeld geometry of the cloud. We
present the details of the observations and data reduction
in section 2. In section 3, we present the results obtained
from the observations and in section 4 discuss the results.
We conclude the paper with a summary presented in
section 5.

2. Observations and data reduction

The optical linear polarization observations of the region as-
sociated with Gal 110-13 were carried out with the ARIES
IMaging POLarimeter (AIMPOL), mounted at the f/13
Cassegrain focus of the 104-cm Sampurnanand telescope
of ARIES, Nainital, India. It consists of a ﬁeld lens in com-
bination with the camera lens (85mm, f/1.8); in between
them, an achromatic, rotatable half-wave plate (HWP) are
used as modulator and a Wollaston prism beam-splitter as
analyzer. A detailed description of the instrument and the
techniques of the polarization measurements may be found
in Rautela et al. (2004). We used a standard Johnson RKC
ﬁlter (λeﬀ = 0.760 µm) photometric band for the polarimet-
ric observations. The plate scale of the CCD is 1.48′′/pixel
and the ﬁeld of view is ∼ 8′ in diameter. The full width
at half maximum (FWHM) varies from two to three pixels.
The read-out noise and the gain of the CCD are 7.0 e−1 and
11.98 e−1/ADU, respectively. The log of the observations
is presented in Table 1.

We used Image Reduction & Analysis Facility (IRAF)
package to perform standard aperture photometry to ex-
tract the ﬂuxes of ordinary (Io) and extraordinary (Ie) rays
for all the observed sources with a good signal-to-noise ra-
tio. When the HWP is rotated by an angle α, then the
electric ﬁeld vector rotates by an angle 2α. A ratio R(α)
has been deﬁned as follows:

R(α) =

Ie(α)

Io(α) − 1
Ie (α)
Io(α) + 1

= P cos(2θ − 4α)

(1)

where P is the fraction of the total linearly polarized
light, and θ the polarization angle of the plane of polariza-
tion. Since α is the position of the fast axis of the HWP at
0◦, 22.5◦, 45◦ and 67.5◦ corresponding to the four normal-
ized Stokes parameters, respectively, q [R(0◦)], u [R(22.5◦)],

where No and Ne are the number of photons in or-

the vicinity of the extraordinary and ordinary rays.

Standard stars with zero polarization were observed
during each run to check for any possible instrumental po-
larization. The typical instrumental polarization is found
to be less than 0.1 %. The instrumental polarization of
AIMPOL on the 104-cm Sampurnanand telescope has been
monitored since 2004 for various observing programs and
found to be stable. Two polarized standard stars HD 236633
and BD+59◦389 chosen from Schmidt et al. (1992) were ob-
served on every observing run to determine the reference
direction of the polarizer. In addition another polarized
standard star HD 19820 was also observed for two nights.
The results obtained for the standard stars are presented
in Table 2. The polarization values for the standard stars
given in Schmidt et al. (1992) were obtained with the Kron-
Cousins R ﬁlter. We corrected for the instrumental polar-
ization from the observed degree of polarization and for
the zero point oﬀset using the oﬀset between the standard
polarization position angle values obtained by observation
and those given in Schmidt et al. (1992).

right ascension, the declination, measured P (%) and po-

from a Gaussian ﬁt to the distribution is found to be 45◦.
The standard deviation in P and θP is found to be 0.8%
and 12◦, respectively. A total of ten stars were observed
by Grinin et al. (1995) toward the Gal 110-13 region. Of
these, seven sources are found to be in common. In Fig. 1,
we compare our results with those from the Grinin et al.
(1995) obtained in R ﬁlter. The eﬀective wavelength of the
R ﬁlter used is not mentioned in the paper. The degree
of polarization obtained by Grinin et al. (1995) is found to
be systematically higher. Two sources, BM And and HD
222142 are identiﬁed and labeled. BM And is classiﬁed as a
classical T Tauri-type star (Herbig & Bell, 1988). This star
is known for its photometric and polarimetric variability

(with AV ≥ 1) from the region containing Gal 110-13 to il-
lustrate the method. The solid curve represents locations of
unreddened main sequence stars. The reddening vector for
an A0V type star drawn parallel to the Rieke & Lebofsky
(1985) interstellar reddening vector is shown by the dashed
line. The locations of the main sequence stars of diﬀerent
spectral types are marked with square symbols. The region
to the right of the reddening vector is known as the near
infrared excess region and corresponds to the location of
pre-main sequence sources. The dash-dot-dash line repre-
sents the loci of unreddened CTTSs (Meyer et al., 1997).
The open circles represent the observed colours, and the
arrows are drawn from the observed to the ﬁnal colours
obtained by the method for each star.

4. DISCUSSION

Unpolarized starlight when propagates through interstel-
lar dust grains that are elongated and somehow par-
tially aligned by the interstellar magnetic ﬁeld, be-
comes linearly polarized. It appears that the grains are
aligned with their shortest axes parallel to the magnetic
ﬁeld direction (Davis & Greenstein, 1951; Lazarian, 2007;
Hoang & Lazarian, 2014; Alves et al., 2014). The polariza-
tion is produced because of the preferential extinction of
one linear polarization mode relative to the other. The po-
larization measured this way gets contributions from all the
dust grains that are present in the pencil beam (since a star
is a point source) along a line of sight. To obtain the polar-
ization due to the dust grains that are present in the cloud,
it is essential to subtract the polarization due to those that
are present foreground to the cloud. But to subtract the

Distance (pc)

Fig. 6. Extinction and distance of 43 stars estimated using
the method described in section 4.1 (top panel). Degree of
polarization (%) versus distance and position angle versus
distance plots for these stars are shown in the middle and
bottom panels, respectively. The broken line is drawn at a
distance of 450 pc where the ﬁrst abrupt rise in the value
of extinction was seen. The open circles show the polariza-
tion results obtained from the Heiles (2000) catalog of stars
selected from a region of 20◦×20◦ ﬁeld containing Gal 110-
13 and Gal 96-15 clouds. The distance to these stars are
calculated using the new Hipparcos parallax measurements
given by van Leeuwen (2007).

The distance to Gal 110-13 was determined by
Aveni & Hunter (1969) by estimating spectroscopic paral-

laxes of two B-type stars, HD 222142 (source illuminating
the reﬂection nebula, vdB 158) and HD 222086. They de-
rived a distance of 440±100 pc to the cloud. However, based
on the Hipparcos parallax measurements of HD 222086
(van Leeuwen, 2007), the distance to the star is ∼ 640±380
pc. No other distance estimates are available for Gal 110-
13 in the literature. We made an attempt to determine the
distance to Gal 110-13 using homogeneous JHKs photo-
metric data produced by the Two Micron All Sky Survey
(2MASS, Cutri et al., 2003). This is based on a method in
which spectral classiﬁcation of stars projected on the ﬁelds
containing the clouds are made into main sequence and gi-
ants using the J − H and H − Ks colors (Maheswar et al.,
2010). In this technique, ﬁrst the observed J−H and H−Ks
colors of the stars with (J − Ks)≤ 0.75 1 and photometric
errors in JHKs ≤ 0.03 magnitude are dereddened simul-
taneously using trial values of AV and a normal interstel-
lar extinction law (Rieke & Lebofsky, 1985). The best ﬁt
of the dereddened colors to those intrinsic colors giving a
minimum value of χ2 then yielded the corresponding spec-
tral type and AV for the star. The main sequence stars,
thus classiﬁed, are plotted in an AV versus distance dia-
gram to bracket the cloud distance (e.g., Maheswar et al.,
2010, 2011; Eswaraiah et al., 2013; Soam et al., 2013). The
pictorial description of the method, given in detail
in
Maheswar et al. (2010), is presented in the near infrared
color-color diagram for the stars chosen from the region
containing the cloud Gal 110-13 (Fig. 2). The extinction
vector of an A0V star for increasing values of AV and a
normal interstellar extinction law is shown. Extinction val-
ues estimated for A0V stars would set the upper limit, and
as we move toward more late-type stars, the extinction val-
ues traced would decrease in our method.

Any erroneous classiﬁcations of giants as dwarfs could
result in underestimating their distance, which could lead to
uncertainty in any estimation of the distance to the cloud.
This problem was resolved by dividing the ﬁeld containing
a cloud into subﬁelds. While the rise in the extinction due
to the presence of a cloud should occur almost at the same
distance in all the ﬁelds, if the whole cloud is located at
same distance, the incorrectly classiﬁed stars in the sub-
ﬁelds would show high extinction not at same but at ran-
dom distances. In case of clouds that have smaller angular
sizes, other spatially associated clouds that show similar
radial velocities could be selected. Here the assumption is
that the clouds that are spatially associated and located at
similar distances, have similar velocities.

In Fig. 3, we show the stars that are lying within the
cloud boundary, identiﬁed based on the Planck 857 GHz
ﬂux, and that are used for estimating the distance of Gal
110-13. The AV −distance plot of these stars are shown in
Fig. 4, along with the change in the extinction as a func-
tion of distance toward the Galactic latitude of b = −13◦
produced using the expressions given by Bahcall & Soneira
(1980). An abrupt increase in the values of extinction,
values which are signiﬁcantly above those expected from
the expressions by Bahcall & Soneira (1980), is noticed for
sources lying beyond ∼ 350 pc. A number of sources lying

1 The loci of main sequence stars and the classical T-Tauri
stars (CTTS, Meyer et al., 1997) intercept at (J − Ks)≈ 0.75.
Therefore the condition (J − Ks)≤ 0.75 allows us to exclude
both stars later than K7V and CTTS from the analysis.

found three main
components having LSR-velocities (VLSR) of about 0
to +4 km s−1, −12 to −3 km s−1 and −30 to −20
km s−1 in the spectra of the region 88◦ ≤ l ≤ 106◦ and
−26◦ ≤ b ≤ −10◦. On account of their spatial distribution,
Cappa de Nicolau & Olano (1990) suggested that all the
three components are related to the region and explained
in terms of expansion of a shell of neutral and molecular
gas centered at l = 99◦ and b = −12◦.5. The radial velocity
of 10 Lac (nearest O-type star) is found to be −9.7 km s−1
(Kaltcheva, 2009). The VLSR velocity estimated for Gal
110-13 using 12CO (J=1-0) is found to be −7.7 km s−1
(Odenwald et al., 1992). We searched for additional clouds
in the vicinity of Gal 110-13 that show radial velocities
similar to that of Gal 110-13. We found one cloud, CB 248,
in the catalog produced by Clemens & Barvainis (1988).
The VLSR velocity of CB 248 lying ∼ 4◦ to the east of Gal
110-13 is found to be −9.5 km s−1 (Clemens & Barvainis,
1988). We estimated the distance to this cloud also
because of its proximity to Gal 110-13 and of the similar
radial velocity. The stars chosen from within the cloud
boundary, again identiﬁed based on the Planck 857 GHz
ﬂux, are shown in Fig. 5. The AV and the distance values
estimated for the selected stars are plotted in Fig. 4. A
sudden increase in AV values compared to those expected
from the expressions given by Bahcall & Soneira (1980)
is found to occur at ∼ 350 pc and beyond, similar to the
result we obtained toward Gal 110-13 region. The vertical
dashed line in AV vs. d plot, used to mark the distance
of the clouds, is drawn at 345 ± 55 pc deduced from the
procedure described below. We ﬁrst grouped the stars
into distance bins of bin width = 0.18 × distance. The
separation between the centers of each bin is kept at half
of the bin width. The mean values of the distances and
the AV of the stars in each bin were calculated by taking
1000 pc as the initial point and proceeded toward smaller
distances. This was done because of the poor number
statistics toward shorter distances. The mean distance of
the stars in the bin at which a signiﬁcant drop in the mean
of the extinction occurred was taken as the distance to the
cloud. The average of the uncertainty in the distances of
the stars in that bin was taken as the ﬁnal uncertainty in
distance determined by us for the cloud.

Of the 207 stars for which we have polarization mea-
surements, 43 of them were classiﬁed as main sequence stars
using the method described above. These sources are those
that satisﬁed the conditions of (J − Ks)≤ 0.75 and pho-
tometric errors in JHKs ≤ 0.03 magnitude. In Fig. 6, the
upper panel shows the derived extinction as a function of
their distance. The plot shows a rapid increase in the value
of extinction close to a distance of 450 pc (broken line).
This slightly disagrees with the distance obtained using ex-
tinction of stars from a larger area of Gal 110-13. In the
middle and the lower panels, we present the variations in
P% and θP as a function of distance. Normally, the degree
of polarization, similar to the extinction due to the dust
grains, rises with the increase in the column of dust grains
along the pencil beam of a star. When the pencil beam of
the star passes through a dust cloud, the P% tends to show
a rapid increase in the value if there is no signiﬁcant change
in the direction of the alignment of the dust grains along

8

the line-of-sight. Therefore by combining the polarization
and distance information of stars projected on a cloud, the
distance to the cloud can be estimated (e.g., Alves et al.,
2008). The measured values of P% show an increase from
∼ 0.5% to ∼ 2% at around 450 pc similar to the rise seen
in the extinction values. Because the values of P% shown in
Fig. 6 are actual measurements, the rise observed in P% at
around 450 pc seems to be more genuine. In that case, the
presence of a number of stars with relatively high values of
extinction at distances close to 350 pc seen in Fig. 4 could
either be due to wrongly classifying of them as main se-
quence stars, or that there are additional dust components
between Gal 110-13 and us. No further information such as
parallax or spectral type is available for these sources in the
literature. Employing the same method as used in this work,
Soam et al. (2013) estimated a distance of 360 ± 65 pc to
another cometary globule, Gal 96-15, located at 14◦ to the
west of Gal 110-13. The absorbing material at around 350
pc is being consistently detected in the AV versus distance
diagrams of both Gal 110-13 and Gal 96-15, suggesting that
the presence of this absorbing layer could possibly be real.
To understand the global distribution of interstellar ma-
terial toward the region containing Gal 110-13 and Gal 96-
15, we searched for sources within a region with a 20◦×20◦
ﬁeld that has both polarization and parallax measurements
(Heiles (2000) and van Leeuwen (2007), respectively). The
polarization results are shown in Fig. 6 (middle and lower
panels) and polarization vectors are drawn in Fig. 11. The
length and the orientation of the vectors drawn in Fig. 11
correspond to the P% and the position angle measured from
the galactic north (increasing eastward), respectively. The
P% values from the Heiles (2000) catalog show an increase
at around 200 pc by ∼ 0.5% and then a possible increase
from ∼ 0.5% to ∼ 1% at around 320 pc giving evidence
of at least two additional dust components lying toward
the direction of Gal 110-13. It is quite intriguing that the
P% values show a decreasing trend after 450 pc as against
what is expected. The contributions from these foreground
absorbing material could be the most likely cause of a few
stars in Fig. 4 showing relatively high values of extinction
at distances less than 450 pc (the distance at which the P%
values show a sudden jump in Fig. 6).

The B-type star, HD 222142 that illuminates the reﬂec-
tion nebula vdB 158, is found to share a common proper
motion with the Lac OB1 association (Lee & Chen, 2007).
This suggests that there could be a possible link between
Gal 110-13 and the Lac OB1. The distance estimated to
Lac OB1 (which includes the distance to the association
as a whole and to the individual subgroups) ranges from
∼ 350 pc to ∼ 600 pc (Kaltcheva, 2009). Using the avail-
able uvbyβ photometry of the stars earlier than A0 type
from a 20◦×20◦ ﬁeld (similar to what is considered by us to
obtain polarimetric results from the Heiles (2000) catalog),
Kaltcheva (2009) estimate an average distance of 520 ± 20
pc to a group of 12 stars that are often identiﬁed as mem-
bers of the Lac OB 1 association. However, the photometric
distance to the most massive member of Lac OB1 associa-
tion, 10 Lac, is found to be 715+107
−92 pc (Kaltcheva, 2009).
But the distance of 10 Lac estimated using new Hipparcos
parallax from van Leeuwen (2007) puts the star at 529+70
−50
pc which is in good agreement with the average distance
estimated for the Lac OB 1 association.

We note that given the galactic latitude of 10 Lac
b = −16.98◦, a distance of ∼ 700 pc would place this star

Neha, S. et al.: Magnetic ﬁeld geometry of Gal 110-13

about 200 pc away from the galactic plane. This is about
a factor of four higher than the typical scale height of star
clusters of age . 10 Myr (Reed, 2000; Buckner & Froebrich,
2014). The color excess versus distance plot presented by
Kaltcheva (2009) clearly shows the presence of absorbing
material even at ∼ 150 pc, giving additional evidence that
there is foreground absorbing material toward the direction
of Gal 110-13. Based on optical photometry obtained using
PanSTARRS-1, Schlaﬂy et al. (2014) estimate a distance of
510±51 pc to Gal 96-15. They also ﬁnd evidence of material
distributed at ∼ 300 pc. In a more recent study based on
non-LTE analysis of high quality data, Nieva & Przybilla
(2014) estimate fundamental parameters of 26 early B-type
stars in OB associations. Of these, they estimated a dis-
tance of 398±26 pc to HD 216916 (also called EN Lac,
B1.5IV) which is considered to be a member of the Lac
OB1 association.

Although the distance to the Lac OB1 association, to
10 Lac and to the surrounding clouds is still uncertain,
we assign 450±80 pc as the most probable distance to
Gal 110-13 based on the results obtained from our po-
larimetric measurements. The uncertainty in the distance
estimated using the 2MASS photometry, described above,
is found to be typically be about 18% (Maheswar et al.,
2010). Additionally, one of the stars, HD 221515, located
within an angular separation of . 1◦ from Gal 110-13 and
located at a distance of ∼ 450 pc, is found to show polar-
ization angle similar to the average value (45◦) of the mea-
sured position angles of the stars projected on the cloud.
This gives an additional reason to believe that Gal 110-13
is located roughly at or closer than ∼ 450 pc.

‡Distances are estimated using the Hipparcos parallax meas-
urements taken from van Leeuwen (2007).

To remove the foreground interstellar polarization from
the observed polarization values, we made a search around
Gal 110-13 within a circular region of 2◦ diameter for
stars having parallax measurements made by the Hipparcos
satellite in van Leeuwen (2007). We excluded those that
are identiﬁed as emission line sources, in binary or multiple
systems or peculiar sources in the SIMBAD. Stars with the
ratio of the parallax measurements and the error in paral-
lax ≥ 2 were chosen. The distance of these stars range from
∼ 90 to ∼ 450 pc. We made polarization observations of
these seven stars in the R-band using AIMPOL. In Table
4, we present the results ordered according to their increas-
ing distance from the Sun. The positions of these stars with

respect to Gal 110-13 are shown in the 2◦ × 2◦ WISE 12µm
image in Fig. 7.
The P% and θP of the seven stars with their distances
are shown in Fig. 8. We estimated the weighted mean of P%
and θP using ﬁve of the seven stars. We excluded the source
at ∼ 90 pc because it shows almost zero polarization. We
also excluded the source located at ∼ 450 pc because the
θP value of this source (42◦) is similar to the mean value
of the θP obtained for the sources projected on Gal 110-13.
We suspect that this source lies either behind or very close
to Gal 110-13. The weighted mean values of the degree of
polarization and the position angles are found to be 0.3%
and 73◦.

Using these values, we calculated the mean Stokes pa-
rameters Qfg(= P cos 2θ) and Ufg(= P sin 2θ) as −0.249
and 0.168, respectively. We also calculated the Stokes pa-
rameters Q⋆ and U⋆, for the target sources. Then we es-
timated the foreground-corrected Stokes parameters Qc
and Uc of the target sources using Qc = Q⋆ − Qfg and
U c = U ⋆ − U fg. The corresponding foreground-corrected
degree of polarization (Pc) and the position angle (θc) val-
ues of the target stars were estimated using the equations
Qc(cid:17). After
P c = p(Qc)2 + (U c)2 and θc = 0.5 × tan −1(cid:16) U c
the foreground subtraction, 186 target stars satisﬁed the
condition of P/σP ≥ 2. The polarization vectors of 186
foreground-subtracted stars are overplotted on the WISE
12µm image as shown in Fig. 9. The IRAS 100µm intensity
contours are also overplotted. The length and the orien-
tation of the vectors correspond to the measured P% and

12µm image of Gal 110-13. The IRAS 100µm contours are
also overlayed on the image. The contours start from 6.0
MJy/sr to 31.2 MJy/sr in increments of 2.8 MJy/sr. The
length of the vectors corresponds to the degree of polar-
ization, and orientation corresponds to the position angle
measured from the north and increasing toward the east. A
vector corresponding to 2% polarization is shown for refer-
ence. The dashed line in white shows the orientation of the
Galactic plane.

increasing toward the east. A vector with 2% polarization
is shown for reference as is the orientation of the Galactic
plane at the galactic latitude of −13◦.

4.3. The cause of the unusual structure of the cloud

The mean values of P% after the removal of the fore-
ground interstellar polarization is obtained as 1.5%. The
mean value of θP from a Gaussian ﬁt to the data is found
to be 40◦ which is considered as the mean direction of the
plane of the sky component of magnetic ﬁeld in Gal 110-13.
The plot of P% vs. θP and the histogram of the θP after
correcting for the foreground interstellar contribution are
shown in Fig. 10. The standard deviation of θP values is
found to be ∼ 11◦ implying that the magnetic ﬁeld lines in
Gal 110-13 are ordered relatively well.
Based on far-infrared, HI, and CO data of the region,
Odenwald et al. (1992) proposed cloud-cloud collision sce-

nario as the most preferred mechanism responsible for the
formation of Gal 110-13. They suggested that the Gal 110-
13 was formed as a result of the interaction between two
HI clouds moving across the line of sight and having veloc-
ity components of −8 and −6 km s−1. They also suggested
that the southern part compared to the northern part is in
an advanced stage that resulted in it being predominantly
molecular. Head-on supersonic collision between two iden-
tical magnetized clouds was studied using 3D-SPMHD sim-
ulations under two special cases of parallel and perpendic-
ular magnetic ﬁeld orientations with respect to the motion
of the colliding clouds (Marinho et al., 2001). The magnetic
ﬁeld was ampliﬁed and deformed in the shocked layers in
both those cases. In the perpendicular magnetic ﬁeld con-
ﬁguration, owing to the interaction of the clouds, ﬁeld lines
are compressed in the shocked layer forming a magnetic
shield that acts like an elastic bumper between the clouds.
This prevents the direct contact of the clouds and also their
disruption during the interaction (Jones et al., 1996).

Formation of clumps was noticed only in the case of par-
allel ﬁeld conﬁguration. Because star formation is active in
Gal 110-13 (Aveni & Hunter, 1969; Odenwald et al., 1992),
and if the cloud was formed as a result of cloud-cloud col-
lision, the initial ﬁeld conﬁguration would have been par-
allel to the cloud motion. According to HI observations by
Odenwald et al. (1992), collided clouds have traveled across
the line of sight in the northeast-southwest direction. But
the current magnetic ﬁeld geometry is almost perpendicular

Fig. 11. Region containing Gal 96-15, Gal 110-13, and 10
Lac are shown in the IRAS 100µm image. The ambient
magnetic ﬁeld direction at the location of Gal 96-15 is
drawn. The mean magnetic ﬁeld direction corrected for the
foreground interstellar contribution is drawn at the position
of Gal 110-13. The arrows show the direction of propaga-
tion of ionizing radiation from 10 Lac toward Gal 96-15 and
Gal 110-13. The vectors drawn in black are based on the po-
larization results obtained from the Heiles (2000) catalog.
The length and the orientation of the vectors correspond to
the degree of polarization and the position angles measured
from the galactic north increasing to the east. A vector cor-
responding to 1% polarization is shown for reference.

to the proposed direction of the interaction of the clouds.
Also, the simulations show that in both parallel and per-
pendicular cases the ﬁeld distribution after the shock inter-
action was found to be chaotic especially on the large scales,
irrespective of the initial ﬁeld conﬁguration (Marinho et al.,
2001). However, the observed magnetic ﬁeld lines from po-
larization are found to be uniformly distributed in contrast
to the results from the simulations.

Lee & Chen (2007) have considered either a supernova
explosion or ionization fronts from a massive star in the
vicinity of Gal 110-13 as an alternate mechanism that might
have caused its cometary shape. In a supernova scenario,
a massive star, which is probably a member of Lac OB1
association to which 10 Lac is considered to be a member,
could have exploded as a supernova. The shock waves from

such an explosion could have traveled to the location of Gal
110-13 at a speed of hundreds of km s−1 to reach Gal 110-13
and compress the cloud to give its present shape and trig-
ger the star formation. In an ionization-front-induced for-
mation scenario of Gal 110-13, the ionizing photons from
10 Lac, soon after its birth, might have compressed the
cloud, creating a cometary morphology and subsequent star
formation (Lee & Chen, 2007). The spatial separation be-
tween Gal 110-13 and 10 Lac is estimated to be ∼ 110 pc
by adopting a distance of 450 pc to Gal 110-13. However,
if we consider the most distant distance of 715 pc to 10
Lac estimated by Kaltcheva (2009), and assume that Gal
110-13 also lies at the same distance, then the spatial sep-
aration between 10 Lac and Gal 110-13 becomes ∼ 180 pc.
As pointed out by Lee & Chen (2007), the ionization front
would take about ∼ 2 − 3 Myr time to travel the distance
of ∼110-180 pc between 10 Lac and Gal 110-13. This is rel-
atively shorter than the 5.5 ± 0.5 Myr age estimated for 10
Lac by Tetzlaﬀ et al. (2011).
Based on the radiation-magnetohydrodynamics (R-
MHD)
(Henney et al., 2009;
Mackey & Lim, 2011), it was shown that both radiation-
driven implosion and acceleration of clumps by the rocket

simulations of globules

11

Neha, S. et al.: Magnetic ﬁeld geometry of Gal 110-13

eﬀect2 tend to align the magnetic ﬁeld with the direction
of propagation of ionizing photons in the globules. The
eﬃciency of this alignment depends on the initial mag-
netic ﬁeld strength. While the ﬁeld reorientation is pre-
vented signiﬁcantly in a strong magnetic ﬁeld scenario
(∼ 150−180µG), in the case of medium and weak (∼ 50µG)
ﬁeld strengths, the ﬁeld lines are dragged into alignment
with the direction of the ionizing radiation. The struc-
ture of a dynamically evolving globule subjected to photo-
ionization depends on the initial magnetic ﬁeld orientation.
Simulations with three initial ﬁeld orientations (perpendic-
ular, parallel, and inclined) with respect to the direction
of propagation of the photo-ionizing radiation have been
carried out by Henney et al. (2009). In the case of strong
perpendicular initial magnetic ﬁeld, the globule evolution
is found to be highly anisotropic. The globule becomes ﬂat-
tened in the direction of magnetic ﬁeld lines. But in the case
of strong or weak parallel initial magnetic ﬁeld, the globule
remains cylindrically symmetric throughout its evolution.
Also, since the magnetic ﬁeld opposes the lateral compres-
sion of the neutral globule, it becomes broader with a snub-
ber head.

The magnetic ﬁeld strength estimated in Gal 110-13 is
found to be ∼ 25µG (section 4.4) assuming the distance as
450 pc. The region containing Gal 110-13, Gal 96-15 and
10 Lac is shown in Fig. 11. It is interesting to note that
the elongated structure of Gal 110-13 is aligned roughly
to the line joining the cloud and the 10 Lac which is ∼
70◦ with respect to the galactic north (also considered as
the direction of propagation of the ionizing photons from
10 Lac). In Fig. 11, we also show the mean value of the
magnetic ﬁeld direction in Gal 110-13 drawn at an angle of
∼ 60◦ with respect to the galactic north. The mean value of
the polarization position angles, obtained from the Heiles
(2000) catalog, of the stars located within the 20
ﬁeld
(as shown in Fig. 11) is found to be ∼ 100◦ with respect
to the galactic north. This is considered to be the direction
of the initial magnetic ﬁeld prior to the ionization of the
region by the 10 Lac.

The magnetic ﬁeld geometry of Gal 96-15 was mapped
by Soam et al. (2013). The initial magnetic ﬁeld orienta-
tion toward Gal 96-15 prior to the cloud being hit by the
ionizing radiation from the 10 Lac was inferred as ∼ 95◦
(Soam et al., 2013) with respect to the galactic north. This
is consistent with the direction of the initial ﬁeld direction
inferred using a larger sample of stars distributed over a
wider area in this study. Thus the initial magnetic ﬁeld di-
rection is oﬀset by ∼ 30◦ with respect to the line joining the
cloud and 10 Lac. The ionizing photons from 10 Lac might
have reoriented the relatively weak ∼ 25µG magnetic ﬁeld
and made it aligned with the direction of propagation, thus
creating the unusually long cometary shape of the cloud.
On the other hand the line joining the head part of Gal
96-15 and 10 Lac makes an angle of ∼ 1◦ with respect to
the galactic north (see Fig. 11). The initial magnetic ﬁeld
in Gal 96-15 was therefore oriented almost perpendicular to
the direction of propagation of the ionizing photons from
the 10 Lac. Accordingly, Gal 110-13 and Gal 96-15 could
be considered as good examples of the photo-ionization of

caused due to the back reaction of the transonic photo-
evaporation ﬂow that leaves the ionization front and moves to-
ward the ionizing source.

clouds with the magnetic ﬁeld oriented parallel and per-
pendicular to the direction of propagation of the ionizing
radiation, respectively. As also seen in simulations, the dif-
ference in the orientation of magnetic ﬁeld direction with
respect to the direction of the propagation of the ionizing
photons could be the reason for the diﬀerence in the phys-
ical structure of both the clouds. While Gal 110-13 shows
an elongated cloud structure with ∼ 1◦ in extent, Gal 96-15
shows a comma structure with the tail part curled almost
perpendicular to the line joining the cloud and the 10 Lac
and almost aligning with the inferred initial magnetic ﬁeld
direction. This suggests that the magnetic ﬁeld in Gal 96-15
might be stronger than the ﬁeld strength estimated in Gal
110-13, causing the ﬁeld to resist its reorientation along the
direction of 10 Lac.

4.4. The structure function

The strength of the magnetic ﬁeld can be estimated by
determining the turbulent angular dispersion in Gal 110-
13. Hildebrand et al. (2009) assumed that the net magnetic
ﬁeld is basically a combination of large-scale structured
ﬁeld, B0(x), and a turbulent component, Bt(x). Initially in
this method the angular dispersion function (ADF) or the
square root of the structure function is calculated, which is
deﬁned as the root mean-squared diﬀerences between the
polarization angles measured for all pairs of points (N (l ))
separated by a distance l (see eq 3). The ADF shows the
dispersion of the polarization angles as a function of the
distance in a speciﬁc region.

Recently, this method has been used as an impor-
tant statistical tool to infer the relationship between
the large-scale structured ﬁeld and the turbulent com-
ponent of the magnetic ﬁeld in molecular clouds (e.g.,
Hildebrand et al., 2009; Franco et al., 2010; Santos et al.,
2012; Eswaraiah et al., 2013). The expression for the ADF
is

h∆φ2(l)i1/2 =( 1

N (l)

[φ(x) − φ(x + l)]2)1/2

N (l)

Xi=1

(3)

M(l)

The total measured structure function within the range
δ < l ≪ d, (where δ and d are the correlation lengths
which characterize Bt(x) and B0(x), respectively), can be
estimated using (Hildebrand et al., 2009):
h∆φ2(l)itot ≃ b2 + m2l2 + σ2

(4)
where h∆φ2(l)itot is the total measured dispersion esti-
mated from the data. The quantity σ2
M(l) is the mea-
surement uncertainties, which are calculated by taking the
mean of the variances on ∆φ(l) in each bin. The quantity
b2 is the constant turbulent contribution, estimated by the
intercept of the ﬁt to the data after subtracting σ2
M(l). The
quantity m2l2 is a smoothly increasing contribution with
the length l (m shows the slope of this linear behavior). All
these quantities are statistically independent of each other.
The ratio of the turbulent component and the large-

scale magnetic ﬁelds is given by the equation:

t i1/2
hB2
B0

(5)

b

√2 − b2

For the Gal 110-13 region we estimated the ADF and
plotted it with the distance in the Fig. 12. We used the

Neha, S. et al.: Magnetic ﬁeld geometry of Gal 110-13

ph∆φ2(l)itot − σ2

polarization angle of 169 stars to calculate ADF. The
measured errors in each bin are very small, which are
also overplotted in the Fig. 12. Each bin denotes the
M(l) which is the ADF corrected for the
measurement uncertainties. Bin widths are taken on loga-
rithmic scale. We used only ﬁve points of the ADF in the
linear ﬁt of eq. 4. The shortest distance we considered is
≃ 0.1 pc. The net turbulent contribution to the angular
dispersion, b, is calculated to be 9.5◦ ± 0.2◦ (0.17 ± 0.003
rad). Then we estimated the ratio of the turbulent compo-
nent and the large-scale magnetic ﬁelds using eq. 5, which
is found to be 0.12 ± 0.002. The result shows that the tur-
bulent component of magnetic ﬁeld is very small in com-
parison to the large-scale structured magnetic ﬁeld, i.e.,
Bt ≪ B0.
The strength of the plane of the sky component of
the magnetic ﬁeld was estimated using the expression
(Franco & Alves, 2015),

Bpos = 9.3(cid:20) 2 nH2

cm−3(cid:21)1/2(cid:20) ∆V

kms−1(cid:21)(cid:20) b

1◦(cid:21)−1

µG (6)

in which the scale factor Q ≈ 0.5 is considered based
on the results obtained from numerical studies (e.g.,
Ostriker et al., 2001). The above expression was de-
rived by modifying the classical method proposed by
Chandrasekhar & Fermi (1953) where they suggested that
the analysis of the small-scale randomness of magnetic ﬁeld
could be used to estimate the ﬁeld strength. This method
relates the line-of-sight velocity dispersion to the irregular
scatter in the polarization position angles under the as-
sumptions that there is a mean ﬁeld component in the area
of interest, that the turbulence responsible for the magnetic
ﬁeld perturbations is isotopic, and that there is equipar-
tition between the turbulent kinetic and magnetic energy
(Heitsch et al., 2001). The volume number density of molec-
ular hydrogen is obtained by estimating the column density
of the region probed by our optical polarimetry and from
the thickness of the cloud, assuming it to be a cylindri-
cal ﬁlament. We used the relation, N(H2)/Av = 9.4 ×1020
cm−2mag−1 (Bohlin et al., 1978) for obtaining the column
density. Based on the method described in 4.1, the aver-
age value of extinction traced by the stars lying behind the
cloud (distance &450 pc) observed in this study is found to
be ∼ 0.6 mag (see Fig. 6). The angular diameter of the cloud
is found to be ∼ 8′. Considering 450 pc as the distance to
Gal 110-13, the value of n(H2) is found to be ∼ 175 cm−3.
However, if we consider the farthest distance of 10 Lac es-
timated by Kaltcheva (2009) as the distance to Gal 110-13
also, then the value of n(H2) becomes ∼ 110 cm−3. We ob-
tained the 12CO line width (∆V = 1.4 km s−1) toward Gal
110-13 from Odenwald et al. (1992). The turbulent contri-
bution to the angular dispersion is found to be b = 9.5◦ ±
0.2◦. Substituting these values in eq. 6, we obtained Bpos as
∼ 25µG for a distance of 450 pc and ∼ 20µG if the distance
is taken as 715 pc. The obtained values of Bpos should be
considered as a rough estimate only mainly due to the large
uncertainties involved in the quantities used in their calcu-
lations. Apart from the uncertainties in the measurement of
line width and in the estimation of b parameter, the domi-
nant source of uncertainty in the above calculation of Bpos
is in the determination of the molecular hydrogen density.

4.5. The polarization eﬃciency

The ratio of the degree of polarization to extinction is a
measure of the eﬃciency of polarization produced by the
interstellar medium. The eﬃciency depends on the nature of
dust grains and the eﬃciency with which the dust grains are
aligned with the local magnetic ﬁeld along the line of sight.
A theoretical upper limit on the polarization eﬃciency was
calculated by assuming dust grains of inﬁnite cylinders with
diameter comparable to the wavelength and the long axes
aligned perfectly parallel to one another.

We determined AV values for 43 stars toward Gal 110-
13 using the method mentioned in 4.1. In Fig. 13 (upper
panel), we show the PR as a function of AR values ob-
tained using AR/AV =0.748 (Rieke & Lebofsky, 1985). The
11 stars are plotted with the condition AV /σ(AV ) ≥ 2.
The solid line is drawn for the observational upper limit
evaluated for the λeﬀ = 0.760µm. The relation between
PV and PR is obtained using the empirical formula given
by Serkowski et al. (1975). Here we used the typical val-
ues of the parameter K = −1.15, which determines the
width of the peak of the curve, and λmax = 0.55µm for
the calculations, which may depend on observer’s line of
sight (Whittet, 1992). The transformed observational up-
per limit is found to be PR/AR ≈ 4%/mag. Toward Gal
110-13 region, the polarizing eﬃciency of dust grains are
found to be below the observational limit. In Fig. 13 (lower
panel), we present polarization eﬃciency as a function of
extinction. The data are consistent with a trend toward
very rapidly decreasing PR/AR with the extinction. The
polarizing eﬃciency tends to be higher for stars with low
extinction and becomes lower for those with high values
of extinction. Thus the population of dust polarizing the
background starlight are dominated by those lying in the
outer layers of the cloud and the ﬁeld orientation probed
using optical polarization are predominantly of the one on
the periphery of the clouds.

5. Conclusions

We present R-band polarization measurements of 207 stars
projected on an unusual, cometary shaped cloud, Gal 110-
13. The main goal of the study was to identify the most
likely mechanism responsible for its cometary structure and
ongoing star formation activity in the cloud. Based on the
results from our polarization measurements of stars pro-
jected on the cloud and evaluating their distances using
2MASS photometry, we estimated a distance of 450± 80 pc
to Gal 110-13. The foreground interstellar polarization com-
ponent was removed from the observed polarization mea-
surements by observing a number of stars located within
a circular region of 2◦ diameter and having parallax mea-
surements made by the Hipparcos satellite. The magnetic
ﬁeld thus inferred from the foreground corrected polariza-
tion values are found to be parallel to the elongated struc-
ture of the cloud. The ﬁeld lines are found to be distributed
uniformly over the cloud. The plane of the sky magnetic

14

ﬁeld strength estimated using the structure function anal-
ysis was found to be ∼ 25µG. Based on our polarimetric
results, we suggest that the compression of the cloud by the
ionization fronts from 10 Lac is the most likely mechanism
responsible for creating the cometary shape and the star
formation activity in Gal 110-13.
