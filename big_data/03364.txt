Abstract—In this paper, we address an important prob-
lem in high-quality audio communication systems. Acoustic
echo cancellation with stereo signals is generally an under-
determined problem because of the generally important
correlation that exists between the left and right channels.
In this paper, we present a novel method of signiﬁcantly
reducing that correlation without affecting the audio qual-
ity. This method is perceptually motivated and combines
a shaped comb-allpass (SCAL) ﬁlter with the injection
of psychoacoustically masked noise. We show that the
proposed method performs signiﬁcantly better than other
known methods for channel decorrelation.

I. INTRODUCTION

Figure 1. Stereo echo cancellation system.

One of the main problems encountered by video-
conference users is the presence of acoustic echo.
Sound produced by the loudspeakers is received by
the microphones and sent back to the remote users.
This creates an echo, as users hear the sound of
their own voice with a delay. As videoconferen-
cing applications incorporate higher sampling rates
and multiple channels, the problem of cancelling
acoustic echo becomes harder. One of the main
difﬁculty in stereo echo cancellation is the strong
correlation that exists between the left and right
channel, making it harder or even impossible to
estimate the echo ﬁlter.

it

For that reason,

is necessary to reduce the
correlation between channels [1]. This can be done
by altering the signals using some form of non-
linear transformation, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Most
of the methods proposed so far to reduce inter-
channel correlation tend to introduce too much
audible distortion to the signal, especially for music.
In this paper, we propose a non-linear processing
that closely matches human perception to maximise
decorrelation while minimising the negative impact

on audio quality.

The paper

is divided as follows. Section II
presents an overview of the stereo acoustic echo
cancellation problem. Sections III and IV describe
the two different parts of the algorithm, respectively
the all-pass ﬁltering and the noise injection. Section
V presents the result of comparison with other
algorithms and Section VI concludes this paper.

II. OVERVIEW AND MOTIVATIONS

In a multi-channel audio system, there usually
exists a correlation between channels (loudspeakers)
that causes the ﬁlter optimisation problem to be
under-determined. This means that it can be im-
possible to determine the exact contribution of each
loudspeaker in the captured echo because there are
an inﬁnity of solutions. It is desirable to maxim-
ise the audio quality, while minimising the inter-
channel coherence. The square coherence is deﬁned
as [2]:

where S··(f ) denotes the cross-spectrum operator.
Assuming there is no linear transformation involved
in the process, the equivalent frequency-dependent
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be expressed as:

SN R(f ) =

(2)

Many of the approaches proposed so far to re-
duce inter-channel coherence have focused on using
memoryless non-linearities [2]. The main advantage
of memoryless non-linearities is that they are easy
to compute. However, non-linearities of this kind
introduce inter-modulation distortion, which quickly
degrades sound quality. Also, there is little control
regarding how much perturbation is caused as a
function of frequency.

Another popular approach is to alter of the phase
of the signal in a time varying way [3], [4]. The
time-varying aspect of the transformation is im-
portant because the transformation would otherwise
be linear and thus unable to reduce inter-channel
coherence. The phase of an audio can be altered
either through the use of an all-pass ﬁlter, or in the
short-term Fourier transform (STFT) domain.

The algorithm we propose in this work was

designed to reach the following goals:

• Minimising inter-channel coherence
• Maintaining good quality audio
• Not altering stereo image in an unpleasant way
• Not introducing additional delay

Because latency is a very important aspect in the
perception of acoustic echo, it is not acceptable
for the proposed algorithm to introduce additional
latency. However, it is still possible to use block-
based processing because it
the
transmission and coding (if any) is performed on
blocks.

is assumed that

The strategy we propose for decorrelating the
audio is illustrated in Fig. 2 and is divided into two
steps:

• Time-varying phase alteration (mainly at high

frequencies)

• Addition of psychoacoustically-masked noise

(mainly at low frequencies)

FILTERING

Allpass ﬁlters have a ﬂat frequency response with
non-linear phase and can be represented by the
general form:

1 +(cid:80)N
1 −(cid:80)N

k=1 akzk
k=1 akz−k

A(z) =

The transfer function in Eq. 3 can be made causal
by adding a constant delay, which leads to:

(cid:80)N
1 −(cid:80)N
k=1 akzk−N + z−N
k=1 akz−k

A(z) =

A ﬁlter of the form of Eq. 4 is generally hard
to design. However, it is possible to alter the phase
similarly across all frequencies by using a simple
comb-allpass ﬁlter:

A(z) =

α + z−N
1 − αz−N

(5)

The ﬁlter in Eq. 5 combines an all-pole comb
ﬁlter to a maximum-phase all-zero comb ﬁlter, so
the poles and zeros are equally spread along the
frequency axis.

For the processing to be non-linear, it is required
to vary the parameter α controlling the ﬁlter. This is
achieved through using overlapping windows with a
constant α for each window. We use both an analysis
window and a synthesis window to prevent any
blocking artifacts. The signal is then reconstructed
using weighted overlap-add (WOLA). Because all-
pass ﬁltering is a time-domain process, no extra
delay is added because at any given time, we do not
need to apply the allpass ﬁlter on whole window. For
the analysis-synthesis WOLA process, we choose

the Vorbis window [5], which meets the Princen-
Bradley criterion [6] and is deﬁned as:

(cid:18) π

2

(cid:18) πn

(cid:19)(cid:19)

h(n) = sin

sin2

(6)

When using a ﬁlter of order N, there are N points
on the unit-circle where the phase response is zero,
regardless of α. In other words, there are frequencies
where no decorrelation occurs. For this reason, it is
necessary to also vary the order N of the ﬁlter in
so that the “nulls” in the phase response change as
a function of time.

Interaural phase difference (IPD) is an important
localisation cue at lower frequencies, so the human
ear is more sensitive to phase distortion in the
low frequencies. For that reason, it is important
to “shape” the phase modulation as a function of
frequency. It is desirable to introduce less distortion
to the phase at lower frequencies than at higher
frequencies. To do so, we propose a shaped comb-
allpass (SCAL) ﬁlter of the form:

A(z) =

α (1 − βz−1) + z−N

1 − α (−βz−N +1 + z−N )

(7)

where α controls the depth of the ﬁlter and β
controls the tilt. Stability is guaranteed (sufﬁcient
condition) as long as

|α| (1 + |β|) < 1

(8)

The effect of the tilt parameter β demonstrated in
Fig. 3 and can be explained by the fact that as β
increases, the poles and zeros of the all-pass ﬁlter
move closer to the unit circle at high frequencies
and away from the unit circle at lower frequencies.
For each new window, once the order N is

determined, we choose α for each frame as:

(cid:32)
(α(N − 1) + r0) ,

(cid:33)

1 − 
1 + |β|

α(N ) = min

(9)

where r0 is a uniformly-distributed random variable
chosen in the [−rmax, rmax] range (typically rmax =
0.6) and  (cid:28) 1 controls the distance to the unit
circle of the high frequency poles. The SCAL ﬁlter
has an overall complexity of only 23 operations per
sample, which is negligible when compared to the
complexity of the adaptive ﬁltering used to cancel
the echo.

IV. PSYCHOACOUSTICALLY-MASKED NOISE
The SCAL processing in Section III is mainly
effective for frequencies above 2 kHz. For lower
frequencies, the ear is more sensitive to phase dis-
tortion (altering stereo image), so it is preferable to
inject noise that is uncorrelated to the audio signal.
In this work, we use the psychoacoustic model from
the Vorbis audio codec, as described in [7]. The
output of the psychoacoustic model determines the
amount and spectral shape of the noise that can be
added without signiﬁcantly altering perceptual audio
quality. The psychoacoustic model is also tuned to
introduce less noise in higher frequencies because
those are already decorrelated by the SCAL ﬁlter.
The noise to be added is generated in the fre-
quency domain. Again, we make use of weighted
overlap-and-add to reconstruct the time-domain sig-
nal. To avoid adding a delay to the signal of interest,
only the noise is delayed and added to the (non-
delayed) input signal. This is made possible because
of the temporal masking effect. The amount of
decorrelation is controlled by the gain γ applied to
the noise before adding it to the signal.

Because we are adding a random signal during
the WOLA process, it is the power that is added
and not amplitude. For that reason, we again need
to use a window that satisﬁes the Princen-Bradley
criterion, and choose the window in Eq. 6.

In practice, this step can be made very simple if
an audio codec is already used in the system. If the
codec has a low bit-rate, then it already introduces

cover the masking curve from the bit-stream and
use it to generate the noise. This makes it possible
to keep the complexity low, again not contributing
signiﬁcantly to the total complexity of the echo
cancellation process.

V. EVALUATION AND RESULTS

In this evaluation, we compare three different

decorrelation algorithms:
• Proposed algorithm
• Smoothed absolute value
• First-order, time varying all-pass ﬁlter

First, the smoothed absolute value non-linearity is
deﬁned as:

˜x(n) = x(n) + α

x2(n) + c2

(10)

(cid:113)

with c = 0.65σx as recommended in [2]. We
compare with this method because it was shown in
[2] to be among the best memoryless non-linearity.
The time-varying ﬁrst order all-pass ﬁlter is imple-
mented as described by [3] but using αmin = −.985
to account for the different sampling rate used in
this work.

The block-based phase alteration method pro-
posed in [4] was excluded from the comparison
because the boundary artifacts caused by the block
processing at high sampling rate causes major qual-
ity degradation, even for very small amounts of
decorrelation. While a WOLA approach could be
used, it would involve additional delay, something
which is not acceptable in this context.

In both the proposed algorithm and the ﬁrst-order
all-pass ﬁlter, there is a random component, so it is
possible to independently process each channel with
the algorithm. On the other hand, applying the same
memoryless nonlinearity (smoothed absolute value
in this case) to each channel would not reduce the
coherence. For that reason, we invert the sign of the
α used for each channel.

A. Methodology

We evaluate the algorithms by considering the
amount of de-correlation they provide and the de-
gradation in quality they cause. The coherence in
Eq. 1 is deﬁned as a function of frequency, which
makes it hard to compare different algorithms. For

this reason, we propose the Bark-weighted square
(cid:80)
coherence, which we deﬁne as:
(cid:80)
f B(cid:48)(f )γ2
f B(cid:48)(f )
(cid:33)

(11)
where B(cid:48)(f ) is the derivative of the Bark scale
(cid:33)
function B(f ), deﬁned as:

xy(f )

(cid:32) f 2

(cid:32) f

B(f ) = 13 arctan

+ 3.5 arctan

(12)
The use of the Bark scale means that each critical
band is given the same weight when computing the
coherence value.

In order to evaluate quality, we use the ITU-R
BS.1387 Perceptual Evaluation of Audio Quality
(PEAQ) recommendation [8]. We use the basic
version implementation by Kabal [9]1 with eight
different audio excerpts. Six of them (piano, fe-
male speech, male speech, glockenspiel, castanets,
quartet) are taken from EBU Tech 3253 - Sound
Quality Assessment Material (SQAM), while the
other two (guitar, Suzanne Vega) are from popular
music. We consider the worst-case scenario of a
mono signal going through both loudspeakers, so
the initial coherence is (by deﬁnition) equal to 1.
All excerpts are sampled at 44.1 kHz.

The algorithms are tested in six conﬁgurations:
• P1: Proposed algorithm, β = 0.62, γ = 0.6
• P2: Proposed algorithm, β = 0.36, γ = 1.0
• P3: Proposed algorithm, β = 0.18, γ = 1.67
• P4: Smoothed absolute value, α = 0.3
• P5: Smoothed absolute value, α = 0.6
• P6: First-order all-pass ﬁlter, αmin = −0.985

B. Quality and Coherence

PEAQ quality results in Table I show clearly that
P4 and P5 alter quality in an unacceptable (values
below -1.5) way for most samples, while P6 has
very unequal quality. Outside of the obvious results
(e.g. P1 outperforms P2, which outperforms P3),
a (paired) Student’s t-test reveals with 95% con-
ﬁdence, that all conﬁgurations of the proposed al-
gorithm (P1, P2, P3) outperforms all other algorithm
conﬁgurations (P4, P5, P6). The only exception is
that P3 is considered to outperform P6 with only
80% conﬁdence.

Inter-channel coherence for the same samples
is shown in Table II. Based on these results, we
can conclude that P3 provides better decorrelation
(lower coherence) than any other algorithm conﬁg-
uration. P2 is considered to also decorrelate more
than all other algorithms, with the exception of P5.
P1 decorrelates more than P6 (only 80% conﬁdence)
and less than other conﬁgurations.

The quality and coherence results are summarised
in Fig. 4. It can be clearly observed that the pro-
posed algorithm not only performs better than the
other algorithms, but is also much more constant
across all audio excerpts, both in terms of quality
and inter-channel coherence.

Subjective evaluation conducted informally with
three listeners based on the MUltiple Stimuli with
Hidden Reference and Anchor (MUSHRA) [10]
methodology are consistent with the PEAQ results
and also show a preference for the proposed al-
gorithm (P1, P2 and P3 ranked higher than any of
the others on average).

bottom-right is worst.

C. Analysis of Individual Algorithms

Listening to the samples makes it possible to
identify the various artifacts caused by the different
algorithms and make the following remarks.

1) Proposed algorithm: While at low levels (P1),
the output of the algorithm is difﬁcult to distinguish
from the original, higher levels (P3) are character-
ised by a “ﬂanging” effect that is also reﬂected in
the stereo image. In some samples, some harshness
can also be perceived (effect of noise injection). It
can be observed from the equivalent SNR (see Eq.
2) in Fig. 5 that the proposed algorithm is able to
introduce a large amount of distortion in the signal
while still maintaining good audio quality (objective
difference grade of -0.36 for the example shown).
2) Smoothed absolute value: Being a non-
linear function, the smoothed absolute value pro-
duces inter-modulation distortion. On harmonic sig-
nals such as speech,
the distortion is perceived
as additional harshness. However, on tonal non-
harmonic signals such as the glockenspiel, the inter-
modulation distortion effect causes new tones to
appear in some regions of the spectrum. The spectra
in Fig. 6 show that the tones may even appear at
low frequencies, which has the effect of changing
the perceived fundamental frequency.

The last artifact can be observed in the castanets
sample. Because castanets have strong time-domain
impulses, the smoothed absolute value causes one
of the channels to be ampliﬁed more than the

In this paper, we have demonstrated that it is
possible to decorrelate the left and right channels in
a video-conference application without signiﬁcantly
affecting the audio quality. The proposed method
includes a shaped comb-allpass (SCAL) ﬁlter to
decorrelate the higher frequencies and psychoacous-
tically masked noise injection at lower frequencies.
The proposed method was shown to outperform
other existing methods both in terms of quality and
amount of decorrelation provided. Moreover, the
total complexity of the proposed algorithm is kept
small so that it does not signiﬁcantly increase the
complexity of a complete echo cancellation system.

results in a very disturbing “bouncing” stereo image,
especially for P5.

introduced by the ﬁrst-order all-pass ﬁlter is a nearly
white noise that is the result of varying the ﬁlter
coefﬁcient α from one sample to another. For most
samples, the noise is masked at lower frequency, so
it is usually perceived as a high-frequency crack-
ling noise. It is mainly perceivable on very tonal
samples, that do not leave much room for masking
noise components.
