WEIGHTED ROGERS–RAMANUJAN PARTITIONS AND DYSON CRANK

ALI KEMAL UNCU

Abstract. In this paper we reﬁne a weighted partition identity of Alladi. We write formulas for
generating functions for the number of partitions grouped with respect to a partition statistic other
than the norm. We tie our weighted results and the diﬀerent statistic with the crank of a partition.
In particular, we prove that the number of partitions into even number of distinct parts whose
odd-indexed parts’ sum is n is equal to the number of partitions of n with non-negative crank.

1. Introduction and Notations

A partition is a ﬁnite sequence π = (λ1, λ2, . . . ) of decreasing (not necessarily strict) positive
integers. The elements of the sequence π are called the parts of the partition π. We deﬁne the norm
of a partition π as the sum of all its parts, λ1 + λ2 + . . . , and this will be denoted as |π|. As an
example, there are 5 partitions, (4), (3, 1), (2, 2), (2, 1, 1), (1, 1, 1, 1), with norm equal to 4. For an
integer n, we will use partitions of n to denote the set of all the partitions with norm n. Abiding the
general convention, we accept the empty sequence as a partition, and it is the unique partition of 0.
The norm of partitions is one of the the most natural statistics. There are ﬁnitely many partitions
with a ﬁxed norm. This makes the norm a great candidate for indexing generating functions. The
theory of partitions is primarily concerned with the relationship between the sizes of diﬀerent sets of
partitions where elements from both sets have the same norm. One early example is due to Euler [4].

Theorem 1.1 (Euler, 1748). The number of partitions of n into distinct parts is the same as the
number of partitions of n into odd parts.

Theorem 1.1 and many other theorems of the same spirit utilizes generating functions in their
proofs. Let A be a set of partitions, and let pA(n) be the number of partitions in A with norm n.
Then

(1.1)

pA(n)qn

Xπ∈A

1 · q|π| = Xn≥0

is the generating function for the number of partitions with the same norm from the set A written in
two separate combinatorial ways, abstract and enumerative respectively. Here it is clear that every
partition π ∈ A makes a contribution of one to the q|π| term.

We would like to introduce four classically studied sets of partitions.

i. Let U be the set of all (unrestricted) partitions.
ii. Let D be the set of all partitions into distinct parts.
iii. Let RR1 be the set of all partitions with diﬀerence between parts ≥ 2.
iv. Let RR2 be the set of all partitions with diﬀerence between parts ≥ 2 where parts are > 1.
These listed sets are nested: RR2 ⊂ RR1 ⊂ D ⊂ U. The generating functions for the number of
partitions from these sets are extensively studied in the literature.

One can generalize the classical approach of writing abstract generating functions with respect to
the norm (1.1) by attaching weights in the place of 1. In 1997, Alladi [1] inquired about the existence

and identiﬁcation of a weight ωS(π) on a set of partitions S so that

(1.2)

Xπ∈S

ωS(π)q|π| = Xπ∈T

q|π|

for some set of partitions T that contains S. He proved the interesting result, which exempliﬁes the
existence of solutions of (1.2):

Theorem 1.2 (Alladi, 1997). Let ν(π) denote the number of parts of π. Then

(1.3)

where

Xπ∈RR1

ω1,2(π)q|π| = Xπ∈U

q|π|

ω1,2(π) := λν(π) ·

ν(π)−1Yi=1

(λi − λi+1 − 1),

and weight of the empty sequence is considered to be the empty product, and is set equal to 1.

Similar weighted identities and their interesting applications have been discussed [1], [2], and [3].
It should be noted that the relation T ⊂ S in (1.2) is of little interest. In this case one can deﬁne

the weight ωS(π) to be the indicator function

ωS(π) :=(cid:26) 1,

if π ∈ T,

0, otherwise.

Our main motivation lies in the similar question to the one of Alladi’s. We would like to identify

statistics Λ such that for sets of partitions S ⊂ T we have

(1.4)

Later we prove the following result:

Theorem 1.3.

Xπ∈S

qΛ(π) = Xπ∈T

q|π|.

Xπ∈D

qO(π) = Xπ∈U

q|π|,

where O(π) := λ1 + λ3 + . . . , the sum of the odd indexed parts, for a partition π = (λ1, λ2, . . . ).

Similar to the problem of identifying weights, the case T ⊂ S is trivial since one can formally pick

Λ(π) =(cid:26) |π|,

∞,

if π ∈ T,
otherwise,

where we assume |q| < 1.

For i ∈ {1, 2}, identifying the weights ωi(π), the partition statistics Λi, and sets of partitions (or

vector partitions) S and T that satisfy

(1.5)

Xπ∈S

ω1(π)qΛ1(π) = Xπ∈T

ω2(π)qΛ2(π)

is an enveloping generalization of the mentioned questions related with (1.2) and (1.4). This general
question reduces to the classical combinatorial study of partition identities for ωi(π) ≡ 1 and Λi(π) ≡
|π| with sets of partitions S and T . One example of this particular case is Theorem 1.1.

In Section 2 we deﬁne q-Pochhammer symbols, and the Ferrers diagrams. We also remark some well-
known results for completeness of the paper. Section 3 has the reﬁnement and a proof of Theorem 1.2.
The crank of a partition and its relation with both the weighted identities and diﬀerent partition
statistics is given in Section 4. Section 5 is devoted for a short excursion of writing generating
functions with respect to the partition statistics, sum of the odd-indexed parts of a partition.

2. Some Basics of Partition Theory

The Ferrers diagram of a partition π = (λ1, λ2, . . . ) is a graphical representation of the parts of π,
[4], where we put λi many dots in the integral coordinates on the i-th row from the top of the diagram
to represent this part. Two examples of such representations are the Ferrers diagrams of (4, 4, 2, 1, 1)
and (5, 3, 2, 2) respectively:

,

.

We note that taking the symmetric images of points in the Ferrers diagram over the (main) diagonal
line gives us a Ferrers diagram of a partition. Two partitions whose Ferrers diagrams that are related
by symmetry over the main diagonal are said to be conjugate of each other. In our example (4, 4, 2, 1, 1)
and (5, 3, 2, 2) are conjugate partitions.

One should also stress that the partitions can be identiﬁed by their Ferrers diagrams and vice
versa. From now on we will be using the notation π for a partition or a partition’s Ferrers diagram
interchangeably.

For the product representations of generating functions of interest we deﬁne the q-Pochhammer

symbols [4]. Let L, and k be non-negative integers. The q-Pochhammer symbol is

(a)L := (a; q)L :=

L−1Yn=0

(1 − aqn).

Some abbreviations of the notation we are going to use are

(a1, a2, . . . , ak; q)L := (a1; q)L(a2; q)L . . . (ak; q)L,
(a; q)L, where |q| < 1.

(a; q)∞ := lim
L→∞

With these deﬁnitions we can write explicit formulas of the generating functions on the deﬁned sets

in multiple ways.

Second equality of (2.2) is the analytic version of Theorem 1.1. The extreme right equality of (2.3)

and (2.4) are the well-celebrated Rogers–Ramanujan identities. Let bC1 (and bC2) be the set of all the

partitions into parts ≡ ±1 mod 5 (and ≡ ±2 mod 5). Hence, for i ∈ {1, 2}

(2.5)

Xπ∈RRi

q|π| = Xπ∈ bCi

q|π|.

This is a classical example of (1.5). Moreover, (2.5) can be equivalently stated in its enumerative form
[4]:

Theorem 2.1 (Rogers-Ramanujan, 1919). Let n be any non-negative integer. The number of par-
titions of n into parts with minimal distance of 2 between consecutive parts (where the smallest part
6= 1) is equal to the number of partitions of n into parts ≡ ±1 mod 5 (and ≡ ±2 mod 5).

3. Partition Identities Involving Weights

Let M , k − 1, and m be non-negative integers. Let PM (k, m) be the set of partitions into exactly M
parts with the smallest part ≥ k and the gap between consecutive parts ≥ m. We let P0(k, m) be the
set that contains the partition of zero, the empty sequence. The sets PM (k, m) are mutually disjoint for
distinct integers M and satisfy the properties PM (k, m+1) ⊂ PM (k, m) and PM (k+1, m) ⊂ PM (k, m).
For brevity we deﬁne the short-hand notation

(3.1)

P≤M (k, m) =

M[l=0

Pl(k, m).

Clearly we have U = limM→∞ P≤M (1, 0), D = limM→∞ P≤M (1, 1), and RRi = limM→∞ P≤M (i, 2)
for i ∈ {1, 2}.

Theorem 3.1. For a partition π = (λ1, λ2, . . . ),

(3.2)

where

(3.3)

Xπ∈PM (k,m)

ωk,m(π)q|π| =

qm(M
2 )+kM
(q)2
M

,

ωk,m(π) := (λM + 1 − k) ·

M−1Yi=1

(λi − λi+1 + 1 − m).

Proof. The M = 0 case is obvious. Let M and k be positive and m be non-negative. A combinatorially
interpretation of qm(M
2 ) is that it is the generating function for the partition π1 := ((M − 1)m, (M −
2)m, . . . , 2m, m). The partition π1 is into M − 1 distinct parts when m and M − 1 are non-zero and it
is the empty partition otherwise. The qkM term is interpreted as the partition π2 into M parts each
equal to k.

Point-wise addition of two partitions can be deﬁned as putting the i-th rows of the Ferrers diagrams
back to back. The empty partition is the identity element of the deﬁned point-wise addition. This
operation on partitions yields new partitions. Point-wise addition of π1 and π2 gives π∗ := ((M −
1)m + k, (M − 2)m + k, . . . , 2m + k, m + k, k).

The partition π∗ has smallest norm satisfying the properties of PM (k, m). We consider this smallest

partition to be colorless. As a generating function,

(3.4)

(q)2
M

keeps count of the partitions into ≤ M parts where every column in the Ferrers diagram can come
in one of two colors counted disregarding the order of these colors. Adding a partition π′ counted by
(3.4) with π∗ point-wise we get a partition π = (λ1, λ2, . . . , λM−1, λM ) ∈ PM (k, m).

There are (λ1 − λ2 + 1 − m) many color combinations for the colored portion of the ﬁrst part of π,
λ1, (λ2 − λ3 + 1 − m) for colored portion of λ2, and so on. The colored piece of λM comes in λM + 1 − k
many possible color combinations disregarding the order of colors. Therefore, there is a total of

(λM + 1 − k) ·

M−1Yi=1

(λi − λi+1 + 1 − m)

possibilities for the partition π ∈ PM (k, m) that are counted by the generating function on the right-
hand side of (3.2).

Letting M → ∞ with (k, m) = (1, 2) in Corollary 3.2 proves Theorem 1.2 by the ﬁrst equality
of (2.1). We also note that Theorem 3.1 is the reﬁnement of the ﬁnite analogue of Theorem 1.2, [1,
Thorem 3], which connects the Durfee square sizes and the number of parts of partitions of the ﬁrst
Rogers–Ramanujan type, RR1. Letting (k, m) = (1, 2) in Theorem 3.1 proves [1, Thorem 3].

An interesting connection with the classical study of partitions comes from the choice of (k, m) =

(2, 2) and letting M → ∞ in Corollary 3.2.

In 1988, Andrews and Garvan [5] found an explanation of the crank of an ordinary partition π.

4. Connections with the crank

Explicitly, the crank of a partition is deﬁned as

cr(π) :=(cid:26)

largest part of π,

if 1 is not a part of π,

# of parts larger than # of 1s − # of 1s in π, otherwise.

Let C=M , C≤M , and C≥M be the sets of partitions with crank = M , ≤ M , and ≥ M respectively. We
have

Theorem 4.1.

(4.1)

Xπ∈RR2

ω2,2(π)q|π| = Xπ∈C≥0

q|π|.

Let (k, m) = (2, 2) and M → ∞ in (3.5). Comparison between [6, (3)] and [6, (11)] with the use of

the right-hand side equation of (2.1) shows
qi2+i
(q)2
i

Xi≥0

=

(q)∞ Xi≥0

(−1)iq(i+1

2 ).

The right-hand side of the above line is the summation over k ≥ 0 of the Dyson’s equation for a ﬁxed
crank k, [7, (3.1)]. This yields Theorem 4.1.

It is not clear that for n ≥ 2 the number of partitions of n with positive crank is the same as the
number of partitions of n with negative crank. A combinatorial proof of this phenomenon as well as
reﬁnements of the ﬁxed crank’s generating functions can be found in [7].

We would like to point out that for k ≥ 2 the weights ωk,m(π) take the identical values on the sets
PM (k − 1, m) and PM (k, m). Therefore, by taking the diﬀerence of ω1,2 and ω2,2 on the set RR1 one
can show

Theorem 4.2. Let ν(π) denote the number of parts of π. Then

Xπ∈RR1
Xπ∈RR1

˜ω1(π)q|π| = Xπ∈C≤−1
˜ω2(π)q|π| = −q + Xπ∈C=0

(4.3)

where

(4.4)

˜ω1(π) =

ν(π)−1Yi=1

(λi − λi+1 − 1) and

˜ω2(π) = (λν(π) − 2) ·

ν(π)−1Yi=1

(λi − λi+1 − 1).

Replacing RR2 with RR1 on the left-hand side of (4.1) and subtracting this from (1.3) side-by-side

proves (4.2). The second equality of (4.2) is due to [7]. Diﬀerence of (4.1) and (4.2) shows (4.3).

Let Dl to be the subset of D that consists of the partitions into exactly l distinct parts. Recall that

O(π) := λ1 + λ3 + . . . , the sum of the odd indexed parts, for a partition π = (λ1, λ2, . . . ).

6

Theorem 4.3. For l a non-negative number and v ∈ {0, 1}, we have

(4.5)

Xπ∈D2l+v

qO(π) = Xπ∈Pl+v(2−v,2)

[(1 − v)ω2,2(π) + v ˜ω1(π)] q|π|.

Proof. Let π = (λ1, λ2, . . . , λ2l+v) be a partition in D2l+v. Consider the projection mapping P2l+v :
D2l+v → Pl+v(2−v, 2) as P2l+v(π) = (λ∗
l+v) = (λ1, λ3, . . . , λ2l+(−1)v+1 ). Therefore, O(π) =
|P2l+v(π)|.

2, . . . , λ∗

1, λ∗

The number of pre-images of a partition must be counted for the veriﬁcation of (4.5). Given
P2l+v(π), there are (λ∗
3−1) = (λ3−λ5−1)
possible λ4’s in the pre-image, and so on. Hence, the total number of possible π ∈ D2l+v that would
project to P2l+v(π) ∈ Pl+v(2 − v, 2) is

2−1) = (λ1−λ3−1) possible λ2’s in the pre-image, (λ∗

2−λ∗

1−λ∗

l+v−1Yi=1

(λ2l−1 − λ2l+1 − 1) × “the number of possibilities for the smallest part.”

Depending on v the number of possibilities for the smallest part changes. If v = 1, then λ∗

l+1 = λ2l+1
is the smallest part. There is only one possibility for the smallest part, which makes the weight of
P2l+1(π) to be ˜ω1(π) for a π ∈ D2l+1. If v = 0, then λ∗
l = λ2l−1 is the second smallest part of the
pre-image π. Hence, there are (λ2l−1 − 1) possibilities for the non-zero smallest part λ2l of π, which
shows that the weight of P2l(π) is ω2,2(π) for a π ∈ D2l.
(cid:3)

Observe that Theorem 4.3 connects the generating function for the number of partitions with
the same sum of the odd-indexed parts with all three theorems: Theorem 1.2, Theorem 4.1 and
Theorem 4.2. For any partition π ∈ RR1, w1,2(π) = ω2,2(π) + ˜ω1(π) by (3.3) and (4.4). Therefore,
summing the left-hand side of (4.5) over all l and v yields

Xπ∈D

qO(π) = Xl,v≥0 Xπ∈D2l+v

qO(π) = Xπ∈RR1

ω1,2(π)q|π|.

(4.6)

(4.7)

This shows Theorem 1.3 as a corollary of Theorem 4.3 using Theorem 1.2. Similarly letting v = 0 in
(4.5) and summing over non-negative l gives

Xπ∈De

qO(π) =Xl≥0 Xπ∈D2l

qO(π) = Xπ∈RR2

ω2,2(π)q|π|,

of Theorem 4.1, where De is the set of partitions into even number of distinct parts. Similarly v = 1
gives the connection of this partition statistic with (4.2). Combinatorially, the equation (4.7) with
Theorem 4.1 gives:

Theorem 4.4. The number of partitions into even number of distinct parts whose odd-indexed parts’
sum is n is equal to the number of partitions of n with non-negative crank

The proof of Theorem 4.3 shows that replacing the norm with a partition statistic in the generating
function (such as O(π)) may be related with generating function for the weighted count of partitions.
Changing statistics in itself is an interesting question. Moreover, as exempliﬁed in (4.6) and (4.7),
the study of writing new generating functions with respect to diﬀerent statistics instead of the norm
would also yield non-trivial examples of (1.5).

5. Generating Functions with respect to the Sum of Odd-indexed Parts

We want to remind the reader that the convenience of writing the generating functions for the
number of partitions with respect to the norm comes from there being a ﬁnite number of partitions
having the prescribed norm. The same applies for O(π). There are ﬁnite number of partitions π with
O(π) = n. This is not necessarily true for all the partition statistics. An analogue of the statistics
O(π) is an example of this observation. Let E(π) := λ2 + λ4 + . . . , the sum of all the even-indexed
parts, for π = (λ1, λ2, . . . ), then all partitions πi = (λ2 + i, λ2, . . . ) for i ∈ Z>0 satisfy E(πi) = E(πj ),
∀i, j ∈ Z>0.

WEIGHTED ROGERS–RAMANUJAN PARTITIONS AND DYSON CRANK

Writing generating functions with some natural partition statistics such as O and E can be studied
directly from the the results of [8] ,[9], and [10]. One decorates the Ferrers diagrams by writing on
the dots on the rows. On odd-indexed rows one puts alternating a and b’s starting from an a and
does the same with c and d for the even-indexed rows starting from a c. We call these four-decorated
Ferrers diagrams. In 2006, Boulet [9] found explicit formulas for the generating functions for four-
decorated Ferrers diagrams from the sets U and D. Let Φ(a, b, c, d) be the generating function for the
weighted four-decorated Ferrers diagrams and Ψ(a, b, c, d) be the generating function for the weighted
four-decorated Ferrers diagrams that has distinct row sizes. Abstractly

Ψ(a, b, c, d) := Xπ∈D

ωπ(a, b, c, d), and Φ(a, b, c, d) := Xπ∈U

ωπ(a, b, c, d),

where

ωπ(a, b, c, d) := a# of a′sb# of b′sc# of c′sd# of d′s.

Explicit formulas of these generating functions are given by the following theorem.

Theorem 5.1 (Boulet, 2006). For variables a, b, c, and d and Q := abcd, we have

Ψ(a, b, c, d) :=

(−a, −abc; Q)∞

(ab; Q)∞

, and Φ(a, b, c, d) :=

(−a, −abc; Q)∞
(ab, ac, Q; Q)∞

.

Theorem 5.1 provides another direct proof of Theorem 1.3: Ψ(q, q, 1, 1, ). Similarly Φ(q, q, 1, 1), and

Ψ(q, 1, q, 1) yield

Theorem 5.2.

Xπ∈U

qO(π) =

1
(q)2
∞

, and Xπ∈D

qO(π′) = (−q)2

∞,

where π′ is the conjugate of the partition π.

Theorem 5.2 can easily be translated to combinatorial results using vector partitions. Some non-

trivial examples of (1.5) coming from Theorem 5.2 similar to (4.6) and (4.7) are as follows:

Corollary 5.3. Let par(n) be the parity of n, par(n) = 0 if n even and 1 otherwise. Let K be the set
of partitions with gaps between parts and the smallest part both ≤ 2. Let π = (λ1, λ2, . . . ), then

Xπ∈U

qO(π) = Xπ∈U

ω0,0(π)q|π|, and Xπ∈D

qO(π′) = Xπ∈K

ˆω1(π)q|π|,

where

ω0,0(π) := (λν(π) + 1) ·

ν(π)−1Yi=1

(λi − λi+1 + 1), and ˆω1(π) := 2par(λν(π)) ·

ν(π)−1Yi=1

2par(λi−λi+1).

Mark that ω0,0(π) ﬁts the deﬁnition (3.3). For uniform deﬁnition of a partition and the deﬁnition
of PM (k, m) sake, we have ignored this case in the prior conversation. We can also replace O(π′) with
E(π′) on the set D. This change would introduce a factor of 2 on the right-hand side of the respective
identities of Theorem 5.2 and Corollary 5.3.

6. Conclusion

It appears that the approach of writing generating functions with statistics other than the norm
oﬀers a wide variety of questions. One of these questions is identifying a statistic and a set of partitions
for given weighted count. There are many examples of Theorem 1.2 like weighted partition identities.
Having a way of connecting these type of identities with the generating functions written with respect
to a partition statistics would expand the horizons of this study.

The crank’s appearance in this study is fortunate but not unexpected. The author would like to

recall that Theorem 4.1 can been presented as a non-trivial example of (1.5).

In a similar fashion, Theorem 4.2 can also be represented in the partition statistic O as

Theorem 6.2. Let Do denote the set of partitions into odd number of distinct parts. Then,

We note that [8], and [10] makes it possible to reﬁne the results involving the partition statistic O
by imposing bounds on the number of parts and the largest part of partitions. Moreover, there are
many more fundamental statistics of partitions similar to O, and E. It would be of interest to see
results and weights related to the rank of a partition and similar known classical partition statistics.
The author is planning on addressing these observations in the future.
