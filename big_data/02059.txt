Abstract

We expand upon a graph theoretic set of uncertainty principles with
tight bounds for diﬀerence estimators acting simultaneously in the graph
domain and the frequency domain. We show that the eigenfunctions of a
modiﬁed graph Laplacian and a modiﬁed normalized graph Laplacian op-
erator dictate the upper and lower bounds for the inequalities. Finally, we
establish the feasibility region of diﬀerence estimator values in R2.

Introduction

Analysis on graphs is a key component to many techniques in data analysis,
dimension reduction, and analysis on fractals. The Fourier transform on a graph
has been deﬁned using the spectrum of the graph Laplacian, see, e.g., [8], [4],
[16], [15], [14], [13], [12], [6], and [1].
In [1], the authors deﬁne the notion of
spread in the spectral and graph domains using the analytic properties of the
graph Fourier transform. More recently in [18] and [19], the authors introduce
the notion of band limiting operators and the eﬀects of such operations in the
graph setting. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian play a
central role in the uncertainty analysis in the aforementioned papers. Motivated
by the feasibility results in [1], we extend the notion of discrete uncertainty
principles such as those introduced in [7], [17], and [5]. We show that for the
graph setting, the cyclic structure of the discrete Fourier transform is no longer
present for the graph Fourier transform. As a result, the support theorems (such
as in [5]) are no longer guaranteed. We extend the frame uncertainty principle
introduced by Lammers and Maeser in [10]. Finally, we establish the feasible
values of the diﬀerence estimators, and provide explicit analysis in the case of
complete graphs. The bulk of this paper is an expansion of the work published
in [3] and detailed in [9].

The structure of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, we provide an overview
of elementary graph theory, and we establish notation; and in Section 3 we
deﬁne the graph Fourier transform. Additive graph uncertainty principles are
established in Section 4.
In Section 5, we extend a result from [10] to the
graph setting. Section 6 details the feasibility region in R2 of possible diﬀerence
estimator values.
In Section 7, we provide uncertainty analysis on complete
graphs. Theorems 4.1, 4.2, 5.2, 5.3, 6.3 and 6.5 are the main results of the
paper. The proof of Theorems 6.3 and 6.5 follow the arguments by Agaskar and
Lu in [1]. As such, Section 6 is quite protracted.

2 Weighted Graphs
A graph G = {V, E ⊆ V × V, w} consists of a set V of vertices, a set E of edges
consisting of pairs of elements of V, and a weight function w : V × V → R+.
For u, v ∈ V , w(u, v) > 0 if (u, v) ∈ E and is zero otherwise. If w(u, v) = 1
for all (u, v) ∈ E, then we say G is unit weighted (or unweighted). There is
no restriction on the size of the set V , but we shall restrict our attention to
|V | = N < ∞. We also assume that the set {vj}N−1
j=0 = V has an arbitrary, but
ﬁxed ordering.

For all graphs, we deﬁne the adjacency matrix A component-wise as Am,n =
w(vm, vn). If A is symmetric, that is, if w(vn, vm) = An,m = Am,n = w(vm, vn),
then we say G is undirected. If a graph has loops, that is w(vj, vj) > 0 for some
vj ∈ V , then A has nonzero diagonal entries. Unless otherwise speciﬁed, we
shall assume that our graphs are undirected, and have no loops. We shall refer
to such graphs as simple.

The degree d of a vertex vj is deﬁned by deg(vj) = (cid:80)N−1
(cid:80)N−1

n=0 Aj,n. We can then deﬁne a diagonal degree matrix,

n=0 w(vj, vn) =

D = diag(deg(v0), deg(v1), ..., deg(vN−1)).

There are two common choices for the graph Laplacian:

L = D − A
L = I − D−1/2AD−1/2,

where I is the N×N identity. L is the graph Laplacian, while L is the normalized
graph Laplacian. Deﬁne the |E| × |V | incidence matrix M with element Mk,j
for edge ek and vertex vj by:

 1,

Mk,j =

if ek = (vj, vl) and j < l
if ek = (vj, vl) and j > l

−1,
0, otherwise.

Deﬁne the diagonal |E|×|E| weight matrix W = diag(w(e0), w(e1), ..., w(e|E|−1)).

Noting that L = M∗W M =

positive semideﬁnite. By the spectral theorem, L must have an orthonormal
basis {χl} of eigenvectors with associated eigenvalues {λl} ordered as 0 = λ0 <
λ1 ≤ λ2 ≤ ... ≤ λN−1. Let χ be the matrix whose lth column is deﬁned by χl.
Let ∆ be the diagonalization of L, that is, χ∗Lχ = ∆ = diag(λ0, ..., λN−1). We
shall use this set of eigenfunctions {χl} to deﬁne the graph Fourier transform in
Section 3.

we may apply the spectral theorem to L. Hence, L must have an orthonormal
eigenbasis {Fl} with associated eigenvalues {µl} ordered as 0 = µ0 < µ1 ≤ µ2 ≤
... ≤ µN−1. Let F be the matrix whose lth column is deﬁned by Fl such that
F diagonalizes L. We shall use this set of eigenfunctions {Fl} to deﬁne the
normalized graph Fourier transform in Section 3.

3 The Graph Fourier Transform
Functions f deﬁned on a graph G will be written notationally as a vector f ∈ RN
where f [j] for j = 0, ..., N−1 is the value of the function f evaluated at the vertex
vj. We say f ∈ l2(G), and use the standard l2 norm: (cid:107)f(cid:107) =
.
Given this space l2(G) of real-valued functions on the set V of vertices of the
graph G, it is natural to deﬁne a Fourier transform based on the structure of G.
To motivate this deﬁnition, we examine the Fourier transform on L1(R), viz.,

(cid:16)(cid:80)N−1

and the formal inverse Fourier transform,

f (t) =

are the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian operator d2

where (cid:98)R = R is considered the frequency domain. The functions e2πitγ, γ ∈ (cid:98)R,
−4π2γ2e2πitγ. If (cid:98)f ∈ L1((cid:98)R), then the inverse Fourier transform is an expansion
of the function f in terms of the eigenfunctions with coeﬃcients (cid:98)f (γ). With
Fourier transform (cid:98)f of f ∈ l2(G) as follows:

this in mind, we use the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian to deﬁne the graph

dt2 since we have d2

dt2 e2πitγ =

∀l = 0, 1, ..., N − 1,

(cid:98)f [l] = (cid:104)f, χl(cid:105) ,

PAUL J. KOPROWSKI

It is clear from the orthonormality of the basis,
{χl}, that χ∗ = χ−1. Thus, the inverse graph Fourier transform is given by

or, equivalently, (cid:98)f = χ∗f .
χ(cid:98)f = χχ∗f = If = f , or, equivalently, f [j] =(cid:80)N−1

l=0 (cid:104)f, χl(cid:105) χl[j].
Similarly, we deﬁne the normalized graph Fourier transform

f of f ∈ l2(G)

as follows:

∀l = 0, 1, ..., N − 1,

f [l] = (cid:104)f, Fl(cid:105) ,

∗
f = F∗f . It is clear from the orthonormality of the basis, {Fl},
or, equivalently,
that F∗ = F−1. Thus, the inverse normalized graph Fourier transform is given
by

F ∗
or, equivalently, f [j] =(cid:80)N−1
f = FF∗f = If = f,
l=0 (cid:104)f, Fl(cid:105) Fl[j].

To achieve a graph analog of inequality (2), we must deﬁne the notion of a
derivative or diﬀerence operator in the graph setting. To do this, we examine
the following product:

W 1/2M f = Drf,

where Dr = W 1/2M . We refer to Dr as the diﬀerence operator for the graph G
because it generates the weighted diﬀerence of f across each edge of G:

(Drf )[k] = (f [j] − f [i]) (w(ek))1/2,

where ek = (vj, vi) and j < i. It should be noted that the convention j < i
is arbitrary, and the importantance of Dr is in its magnitude. Indeed, in [14],
(cid:107)Drf(cid:107) is the smoothness measure of a function. It is also common to refer to
Drf as the derivative of f (see [1]). In the case of the unit weighted circulant
graph (see Figure 1), Dr is the diﬀerence operator in [10]. With this in mind,
we establish a graph Fourier transform inequality of the form of (2).

Theorem 4.1 Let G be a simple, connected, and undirected graph. Then, for
any non-zero function f ∈ l2(G), the following inequalities hold:

0 < (cid:107)f(cid:107)2 ˜λ0 ≤ (cid:107)Drf(cid:107)2 +

(3)

(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)Dr(cid:98)f
(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)2 ≤ (cid:107)f(cid:107)2 ˜λN−1,

where 0 < ˜λ0 ≤ ˜λ1 ≤ ... ≤ ˜λN−1 are the ordered real eigenvalues of L + ∆.
Furthermore, the bounds are sharp.

Proof: Noting that

(cid:107)Drf(cid:107)2 = (cid:104)Drf, Drf(cid:105) = (cid:104)f, χ∆χ∗f(cid:105) =

we have

(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)Dr(cid:98)f
(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)2

(cid:107)Drf(cid:107)2 +

and that

(cid:68)(cid:98)f , (L + ∆)(cid:98)f

Assuming ˜λ0 > 0, Inequality (3), and its sharpness, follow directly from L +
∆ being symmetric and positive semideﬁnite, and by applying the properties
of the Rayleigh quotient to L + ∆. To prove positivity of ˜λ0, note that for
= 0 we must have (cid:104)h, ∆h(cid:105) = 0 = (cid:104)h, Lh(cid:105) for some h (cid:54)= 0. This is
impossible as we have, for non-zero h, (cid:104)h, ∆h(cid:105) = 0 if and only if h = c[1, 0, ...., 0]∗
for some c (cid:54)= 0. This implies (cid:104)h, Lh(cid:105) = deg(v0)c2 > 0 due to the connectivity of
(cid:4)
the graph.
Alternatively, if we consider the normalized Laplacian L, we deﬁne a slightly
diﬀerent notion of the diﬀerence operator in order to reﬂect the normalized

6

structure when using the normalized Laplacian. For a function f ∈ l2(G), deﬁne
the normalized graph diﬀerence operator as

Dnr = D−1/2Dr = D−1/2W 1/2M.

We can then prove (in Theorem 4.2) a graph diﬀerential normalized Fourier
transform inequality of the form of Theorem 4.1.

Theorem 4.2 Let G be a simple, connected, and undirected graph. Then, for
any non-zero function f ∈ l2(G), the following inequalities hold:

0 < (cid:107)f(cid:107)2 ˜µ0 ≤ (cid:107)Dnrf(cid:107)2 +

where 0 < ˜µ0 ≤ ˜µ1 ≤ ... ≤ ˜µN−1 are the ordered real eigenvalues of L + D.
Furthermore, the bounds are sharp.

Proof: After suitable substitution of normalized elements, the result follows
(cid:4)
from arguments similar to the proof of Theorem 4.1.

5 Graph Frame Uncertainty Principles

As a generalization of the work by Lammers and Maeser in [10], we show that the
modiﬁed Laplacian operator L + ∆ will dictate an additive uncertainty principle
for frames. Let

be a d×N matrix whose columns form a Parseval frame for Cd, i.e., EE∗ = Id×d.
Let T be the N × N permutation matrix, viz.,

Let D = T 0 − T , then D∗ = T 0 − T N−1, and the classical Laplacian in the
discrete setting is given by Lc = D∗D = 2T 0 − T − T N−1. Let ∆c be the
diagonalization of Lc. Let (cid:107)·(cid:107)f r denote the Frobenius norm. Let DF T denote
the unitary discrete Fourier transform matrix. The following result holds.

Graph theoretic uncertainty and feasibility

7

Theorem 5.1 (Lammers and Maeser [10]) For ﬁxed dimension d and N ≥ d ≥
2, the following inequalities hold for all d × N Parseval frames:

0 < G(N, d) ≤ (cid:107)DDF T E∗(cid:107)2

f r + (cid:107)DE∗(cid:107)2

f r

≤ H(N, d)
≤ 8d.

(5)

Furthermore, the minimum (maximum) occurs when columns of E∗ are the d
orthonormal eigenvectors corresponding to the d smallest (largest) eigenvalues
of Lc + ∆c. The constant G(N, d) is the sum of those d smallest eigenvalues,
and H(N, d) is the sum of those d largest eigenvalues.

To extend the inequalities in Theorem 5.1 to the graph Fourier transform
setting, we apply Dr to the frame’s conjugate transpose E∗ and to the graph
Fourier transform χ∗E∗, and then ﬁnd bounds for the Frobenius norms.

Theorem 5.2 For any graph G as in Theorem 4.1, the following inequalities
hold for all d × N Parseval frames E:

˜λj ≤ (cid:107)Drχ∗E∗(cid:107)2

Proof: Using the trace formulation of the Frobenius norms yields

(cid:107)Drχ∗E∗(cid:107)2

r Drχ∗E∗) + tr(DrE∗ED∗
r ).
Using the invariance of the trace when reordering products, we have

f r = tr(EχD∗

f r + (cid:107)DrE∗(cid:107)2

(7)

(cid:107)Drχ∗E∗(cid:107)2

f r + (cid:107)DrE∗(cid:107)2

f r = tr(Lχ∗E∗Eχ) + tr(LE∗E)

= tr(Lχ∗E∗Eχ) + tr(χ∆χ∗E∗E)
= tr((L + ∆)χ∗E∗Eχ).

The operator ∆+L is real, symmetric, and positive semideﬁnite. By the spectral
theorem, it has an orthonormal eigenbasis P that, upon conjugation, diagonal-
izes ∆ + L:

P ∗(∆ + L)P = ˜∆ = diag( ˜λ0, ˜λ1, ..., ˜λN−1).

Hence, we have
(cid:107)DrχE∗(cid:107)2

f r + (cid:107)DrE∗(cid:107)2

f r = tr((∆ + L)χ∗E∗Eχ) = tr(P ˜∆P ∗χ∗E∗Eχ)

where K = EχP . The matrix K is a Parseval frame because unitary transforma-
tions of Parseval frames are Parseval frames. Therefore, tr(K∗K) = tr(KK∗) =
d. K∗K is also the product of matrices with operator norm ≤ 1. Therefore,
each of the entries, (K∗K)j,j , satisﬁes 0 ≤ (K∗K)j,j ≤ 1. Hence, minimizing

Choosing E to be the ﬁrst (last) d rows of (χP )∗ accomplishes this. The posi-
(cid:4)
tivity of the bounds follows from the proof of Theorem 4.1

A similar result holds for the normalized graph Laplacian.

Theorem 5.3 For any graph G as in Theorem 4.1, the following inequalities
hold for all d × N Parseval frames E:

˜µj ≤ (cid:107)DnrF∗E∗(cid:107)2

where { ˜µj} is the ordered set of real, positive eigenvalues of L+D. Furthermore,
these bounds are sharp.

Proof: After suitable substitution of normalized elements, the result follows
(cid:4)
from arguments similar to the proof of Theorem 5.2.

6 Feasibility Region

We extend the concept of the feasibility region for graph and spectral spreads
from Agaskar and Lu [1]. As such, the structure of the arguments used here
follows the structure of Agaskar and Lu’s proofs. Deﬁne the diﬀerence operator
feasibility region F R as follows:

(cid:26)

F R =

(x, y) : (cid:107)Drf(cid:107)2 = x and

= y for some unit normed f (cid:54)= 0 ∈ l2(G)

.

(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)Dr(cid:98)f
(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)2

(cid:27)

Our analysis relies on a key lemma, which in turn, relies on the following theorem
due to Barvinok [2].
Theorem 6.1 (Barvinok [2]) Let SymN be the set of real N × N symmetric
matrices and let SN
+ be the subset of positive semideﬁnite symmetric matrices.
Suppose that R > 0 and N ≥ R + 2. Let H ⊂ SymN be an aﬃne subspace such
+ ∩ H is nonempty and bounded, then there exists
a matrix M ∈ SN

that codim(H) =(cid:0)R+2

(cid:1). If SN

Lemma 6.2 Let M1 and M2 be rank one positive semideﬁnite matrices such
that

tr(Mi) = 1, tr(∆Mi) = xi and tr(LMi) = yi for i = 1, 2.

(9)
Then, for any β ∈ [0, 1], there exists a rank one positive semideﬁnite matrix M
satisfying

tr(M ) = 1, tr(∆M ) = x and tr(LM ) = y,

(10)

where x = βx1 + (1 − β)x2 and y = βy1 + (1 − β)y2.
Proof: Let each positive semideﬁnite matrix Mi satisfy (9). For any β ∈ [0, 1],
let M(cid:48) = βM1 + (1 − β)M2. Clearly, M(cid:48) ∈ SN
+ and if we
let x = βx1 + (1 − β)x2 and y = βy1 + (1 − β)y2 then

+ by the convexity of SN

M(cid:48) ∈ H = {M ∈ SymN : tr(M ) = 1, tr(∆M ) = x, and tr(LM ) = y} .

By the linear independence of I, L, and ∆, we have that H is an aﬃne subspace
+ ∩ H (cid:54)= ∅. Noting that
of SymN with codimension 3. Hence, we have that SN
+ ∩ H has nonnegative eigenvalues which must sum to 1, the
any element of SN
boundedness of this subspace is straightforward to show:

∀M ∈ SN

+ ∩ H, (cid:107)M(cid:107)2

f r = tr(M 2) ≤ tr(M ) = 1.

By Theorem 6.1, we conclude that there exists a matrix M of rank one satisfying
(cid:4)
(10).
The importance of Lemma 6.2 to our arguments shall lie in the fact that any
matrix M satisfying (10) has eigenvalue 1 with multiplicity 1 and eigenvalue 0
with multiplicity N − 1. Hence, if M g = g for a unit vector g, then M = gg∗.
We shall prove some key properties of the diﬀerence operator feasibility region.

Theorem 6.3 Let F R be the diﬀerence operator feasibility region for a simple,
connected graph G with N vertices. Then, the following properties hold.

a) F R is a closed subset of [0, λN−1] × [0, λN−1] where λN−1 is the maximal

eigenvalue of the Laplacian L.

(cid:80)N−1

b) y = 0 and x = 1
N

j=0 λj is the only point on the horizontal axis in F R.

x = 0 and y = L0,0 is the only point on the vertical axis in F R.

c) F R is in the half plane deﬁned by x + y ≥ ˜λ0 > 0 with equality if and only

if (cid:98)f is in the eigenspace associated with ˜λ0.

d) If N = 2, then F R is the circle given by

F R =(cid:8)(α(a − b)2, 2αb2) : a2 + b2 = 1 and α > 0(cid:9) .

If N ≥ 3, then F R is a convex region.

Note that the operation f (cid:55)→ (cid:98)f is an isomorphism of the unit sphere in l2(G).

Proof: Recall that (cid:107)Drf(cid:107)2 = (cid:104)f, Lf(cid:105) =

(cid:69)

(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)Dr(cid:98)f
(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)2

Hence, for the entirety of this proof we rely on the fact that if a unit normed
g ∈ l2(G) (respectively, a unique unit normed g ∈ l2(G)) achieves a value in the
feasibility region for (cid:104)g, ∆g(cid:105), and for (cid:104)g, Lg(cid:105) , then there exists a unit normed
f ∈ l2(G) (respectively, a unique unit normed f ∈ l2(G)) that achieves the same
values for (cid:107)Drf(cid:107)2 and

respectively, viz., f = χg.

a) By the properties of the Rayleigh quotient, we have for any unit normed

g ∈ l2(G) that

0 = λ0 ≤ (cid:104)g, ∆g(cid:105) ≤ λN−1.

The maximum is attained if g = [0, ..., 0, 1](cid:48). Similarly, we have that

0 = λ0 ≤ (cid:104)g, Lg(cid:105) ≤ λN−1,

and the maximum is attained if g is in the eigenspace associated with λN−1
for L. Hence, F R ⊂ [0, λN−1] × [0, λN−1]. F R is closed because it is the

x = 0 if and only if g = ±[1, 0, ..., 0](cid:48). Hence, we have y = L0,0, which is
the degree of the ﬁrst vertex of G.

c) This follows directly from Theorem 4.1.

d) If N = 2, then the only simple connected graph is a graph with one edge of
weight α > 0. Applying the corresponding operators to any unit normed
vector g = [a, b]∗ yields the desired result.
To show that F R is convex for N ≥ 3, we shall formulate this as a problem
in SymN . First, we note that showing convexity is equivalent to showing
the following: if g1, g2 ∈ l2(G) and

(cid:104)gi, gi(cid:105) = 1, (cid:104)gi, ∆gi(cid:105) = xi, and (cid:104)gi, Lgi(cid:105) = yi for i = 1, 2,

(11)
then for any β ∈ [0, 1], we can always ﬁnd a function g ∈ l2(G) satisfying

(cid:104)g, g(cid:105) = 1, (cid:104)g, ∆g(cid:105) = x, and (cid:104)g, Lg(cid:105) = y

where x = βx1 + (1 − β)x2 and y = βy1 + (1 − β)y2. Let g1 and g2 satisfy
(11) and set M1 = g1g∗

M2 yields M = gg∗ where M satisﬁes (10). This is easily shown, via the
cyclic properties of the trace operator, to be equivalent to g satisfying (12).

We now turn our attention to the lower boundary of F R. The diﬀerential

uncertainty curve (DUC) ω(x) is deﬁned as follows:

∀x ∈ [0, λN−1], ω(x) = inf
g∈l2(G)

(cid:104)g, Lg(cid:105) subject to (cid:104)g, ∆g(cid:105) = x and (cid:107)g(cid:107) = 1.

See Figure (2) for a sample uncertainty curve. Given a ﬁxed x ∈ [0, λN−1], we
say g(cid:48) attains the DUC if for all g with (cid:104)g, ∆g(cid:105) = x we have (cid:104)g(cid:48), Lg(cid:48)(cid:105) ≤ (cid:104)g, Lg(cid:105) .
We shall show that for all x ∈ [0, λN−1], there exists a function attaining the
DUC. In fact, we shall show that certain eigenfunctions of the matrix valued
function K(α) = L − α∆ will attain the DUC for every value of x. Hence, we
shall show that for all x ∈ (0, λN−1),

ω(x) = min
g∈l2(G)

(cid:104)g, Lg(cid:105) subject to (cid:104)g, ∆g(cid:105) = x and (cid:104)g, g(cid:105) = 1.

We begin classifying ω(x) by motivating the use of the operator K(α). Find-
ing values that attain the diﬀerential uncertainty curve amounts to solving a
quadratically constrained convex optimization problem. We achieve this by
deﬁning the following Lagrangian function, and setting its gradient equal to
zero. Deﬁne the DUC Lagrangian, Γ, as

Γ(g, α, β) = (cid:104)g, Lg(cid:105) − α((cid:104)g, ∆g(cid:105) − x) − β((cid:104)g, g(cid:105) − 1).

Upon taking the gradient with respect to g and setting the gradient equal to
zero, we have for some optimal g(cid:48) that

∇g(Γ(g, α, β))(g(cid:48)) = 2Lg(cid:48) − 2α∆g(cid:48) − 2βg(cid:48) = 0

and

K(α)g(cid:48) = (L − α∆)g(cid:48) = βg(cid:48).

Thus, the minimizer of the quadratically constrained problem is an eigenfunction
of the operator K(α). Deﬁne m(α) to be the minimal eigenvalue of K(α), and
deﬁne σ(α) to be its associated eigenspace. We shall prove that a function g
attains the DUC if and only if it in σ(α). In order to prove this, we shall rely
heavily on analysis of the functions H+ and H− deﬁned as follows:

H+(α) =

g∈σ(α):(cid:107)g(cid:107)=1

(cid:104)g, ∆g(cid:105) and H−(α) =

(cid:104)g, ∆g(cid:105) ,

(13)

which measure the maximal, respectively, minimal values that can be achieved
by eigenfunctions in σ(α).

Lemma 6.4 The following properties hold for H+(α) and H−(α).
a) For all α ∈ R, H+(α) and H−(α) are increasing functions.
b) limα→∞ H±(α) = λN−1, and limα→−∞ H±(α) = 0.

c) On any ﬁnite interval [a, b], the functions H± diﬀer on at most a ﬁnite
number of points denoted by Σ = {b1, ..., bk} for some k ≥ 0. For all
α (cid:54)∈ Σ, the following holds: H+(α) = H−(α) = −m(cid:48)(α).

Proof:

a) For α1 < α2, we take any ν1 ∈ σ(α1) and ν2 ∈ σ(α2), and we have, by the

Rayleigh quotient for symmetric matrices, that

(cid:104)ν2, K(α1)ν2(cid:105) ≥ m(α1) = (cid:104)ν1, K(α1)ν1(cid:105) .

Similarly, we have

−(cid:104)ν2, K(α2)ν2(cid:105) = −m(α2) ≥ −(cid:104)ν1, K(α2)ν1(cid:105) .

Combining the inequalities yields

(cid:104)ν2, (K(α1) − K(α2))ν2(cid:105) ≥ (cid:104)ν1, (K(α1) − K(α2))ν1(cid:105) .

(14)

Graph theoretic uncertainty and feasibility

13

Noting that K(α1) − K(α2) = (α2 − α1) ∆, and substituting into (14)
yields

(cid:104)ν2, ∆ν2(cid:105) ≥ (cid:104)ν1, ∆ν1(cid:105)

Upon specializing to the unit norm eigenfunctions that attain the maxi-
mization in (13) we have

H+(α2) = (cid:104)ν2, ∆ν2(cid:105) ≥ (cid:104)ν1, ∆ν1(cid:105) = H+(α1)

Similarly, upon specializing to the unit norm eigenfunctions that attain the
minimum in (13) we have that H−(α2) = (cid:104)ν2, ∆ν2(cid:105) ≥ (cid:104)ν1, ∆ν1(cid:105) = H−(α1).

b) Let α ∈ R, then we clearly have

H+(α) ≥ H−(α) ≥ 0

by the positive semideﬁnite property of ∆. Let ν ∈ σ(α) be unit normed.
Recall that the canonical ﬁrst basis vector e0 spans the null space of ∆ and
hence (cid:104)e0, ∆e0(cid:105) = 0. For any unit norm ν ∈ σ(α), we have (cid:104)ν, Lν(cid:105) ≥ 0,
and if α < 0, we have −α(cid:104)ν, ∆ν(cid:105) ≥ 0. Thus by the properties the Rayleigh
quotient we have

0 ≤ −α(cid:104)ν, ∆ν(cid:105) ≤ (cid:104)ν, K(α)ν(cid:105) ≤ (cid:104)e0, K(α)e0(cid:105) = Lo,o + 0 = Lo,o.

(15)

Multiplying (15) by − 1

α yields

0 ≤ (cid:104)ν, ∆ν(cid:105) ≤ − 1
α
Since this is valid for all ν ∈ σ(α) we have

L0,0.

0 ≤ H−(α) ≤ H+(α) ≤ − L0,0
α
As α → −∞, we squeeze H±(α) to zero as desired.
For the limit as α → ∞, recall that the last canonical eigenfunction eN−1
is in the eigenspace of λN−1 for ∆. Hence, (cid:104)eN−1, ∆eN−1(cid:105) = λN−1, and we
have

(cid:104)ν, K(α)ν(cid:105) ≤ (cid:104)eN−1, K(α)eN−1(cid:105)

= (cid:104)eN−1, LeN−1(cid:105) − αλN−1
= LN−1,N−1 − αλN−1.
Adding (α(cid:104)ν, ∆ν(cid:105) − LN−1,N−1) to both sides yields

(cid:104)ν, Lν(cid:105) − LN−1,N−1 ≤ α ((cid:104)ν, ∆ν(cid:105) − λN−1) ≤ 0

where the last inequality in (16) is due to α > 0 and the properties of the
Rayleigh quotient. Taking the absolute value of both sides, and dividing
by α yields

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≥ |(cid:104)ν, ∆ν(cid:105) − λN−1| ≥ 0.

The desired result follows by taking α → ∞.

c) We use eigenvalue perturbation results such as those in [11] to establish
that m(α) is analytic for [a, b] ∩ (Υ)c where Υ is a ﬁnite subset of [a, b].
K(α) is real, is linear in α, hence analytic, and it is symmetric. By Theo-
rem 2 on page 404 of [11], there exist N analytic functions ξ0(·), ..., ξN−1(·)
and N analytic vector valued functions w0(·), ..., wN−1(·) such that

∀α ∈ R K(α)wj(α) = ξj(α)wj(α)

(17)

and

(cid:104)wj(α), wk(α)(cid:105) =

(cid:40)

if j (cid:54)= k
if j = k

.

Let [a, b] be an arbitrary ﬁnite interval in R, and ﬁx α0 ∈ (a, b). If σ(α0) is
one dimensional, then exactly one eigenvalue function ξj(α0) equals m(α0).
By the analycity of all the eigenvalue functions, there exists some δ ball
about α0, such that if |α − α0| < δ then ξj(α) < ξk(α) for k (cid:54)= j. Hence,
m(α) = ξj(α) for α ∈ (α0 − δ, α0 + δ) and therefore m(α) is analytic on
the δ ball.

If σ(α0) has dimension greater than one, then more than one eigenvalue
function from ξl(α0) for l = 0, ..., N − 1 attains the value m(α0). In this
case, m(α) may not be analytic in any neighborhood of α0. For instance,
if two of the eigenvalue functions cross at exactly α0, then there is no
derivative for m(α) at α0. Deﬁne ρj(α) for j = 0, ..., d ≤ N − 1 as the
distinct eigenvalue functions of K(α), and let nj be the multiplicity of each
function. For [a, b] ⊂ R, deﬁne

(cid:91)

Υ =

0≤i<j≤d

{α ∈ [a, b] : ρi(α) = ρj(α)} .

As deﬁned, Υ has ﬁnite order. Indeed, if |Υ| = ∞ then at least two of
the ρj’s would be equal on an inﬁnite set of points on the interval, and
therefore would be equal on the interval because both are analytic.
To conclude the proof, we shall relate m(α) to H±(α). For ﬁxed α0 ∈ [a, b],
we without loss of generality, assume the ﬁrst k + 1 distinct eigenvalue
functions ρi for i = 0, ..., k intersect at α0, and are minimal. That is to
say, ρi(α0) = m(α0). The associate eigenfunction functions are denoted

Graph theoretic uncertainty and feasibility

by wi,j(α) for i = 0, ..., k, and j = 1, ..., ni. Hence, wij(α0) form an
orthonormal basis for σ(α0). Therefore, if ν ∈ σ(α0) is unit normed, we
have

ν =

Since ν(α0) = ν ∈ σ(α0) was arbitrary and unit normed, and since the di-

achieved by maximizing (respectively minimizing) over the ρi(α0)’s. Hence

Since all of the ρi(α) are distinct (except at α0) in some neighborhood N
covering α0 and small enough that N ∩ Υ = α0 or ∅, there exist l, m ∈
{0, ..., k} such that

α ≤ α0
ρl(α)
ρm(α) α ≥ α0.
If for some j (cid:54)= m, ρ(cid:48)
m(α0) then ρj(α) < ρm(α) for some α ∈
N ∩ [α0,∞). This contradicts the fact that m(α) = ρm(α) on this interval.
Similarly, if there exists some j (cid:54)= l, with ρ(cid:48)
l(α0) there is a
contradiction on N ∩ (−∞, α0]. Hence, we have

j(α0) > ρ(cid:48)

j(α0) < ρ(cid:48)

m(α) =

H+(α) = −ρ(cid:48)

m(α) = −m(cid:48)(α) for α ∈ N ∩ [α0,∞),

and

H−(α) = −ρ(cid:48)

l(α) = −m(cid:48)(α) for α ∈ N ∩ (−∞, α0].

Right and left continuity follow from ρm and ρl having continuous deriva-
tives. If k = 0, that is, if only one of the ρi functions aligns with m at α0,
then m(α) is analytic on N and we have H−(α) = H+(α) = −m(cid:48)(α) on
N . If we denote Σ as the set of α ∈ [a, b] for which H−(α) (cid:54)= H+(α), we
must have Σ ⊆ Υ and therefore Σ is a ﬁnite set.

We now prove that vectors in σ(α) characterize the DUC.

Theorem 6.5 A unit normed function f ∈ l2(G) with (cid:107)Drf(cid:107)2 = x ∈ (0, λN−1)
α ∈ R.
Proof: As before, it suﬃces to show that a unit normed η ∈ l2(G) satisfying
(cid:104)η, ∆η(cid:105) = x ∈ (0, λN−1) achieves the DUC if and only if η ∈ σ(α) for some
α ∈ R.
For the suﬃcient condition, ﬁx α ∈ R. Then for any arbitrary unit norm
η ∈ l2(G) we have

(cid:104)η, K(α)η(cid:105) = (cid:104)η, Lη(cid:105) − α(cid:104)η, ∆η(cid:105) .

The Rayleigh quotient for K(α) is bounded sharply below by m(α). Hence we
obtain for any unit normed ν ∈ σ(α),

(cid:104)ν, Lν(cid:105) − α(cid:104)ν, ∆ν(cid:105) = m(α) ≤ (cid:104)η, Lη(cid:105) − α(cid:104)η, ∆η(cid:105) .

We assumed (cid:104)ν, ∆ν(cid:105) = x, and upon restricting η to (cid:104)η, ∆η(cid:105) = x, we have
(cid:104)η, Lη(cid:105) ≥ (cid:104)ν, Lν(cid:105) . Hence, any unit normed ν ∈ σ(α) achieves the DUC.
For the necessary condition, it suﬃces to show that for any function η ∈ l2(G)
that achieves the DUC, there is an α and a unit norm ν ∈ σ(α) such that
(cid:104)ν, ∆ν(cid:105) = (cid:104)η, ∆η(cid:105) = x. Indeed, having also assumed η lies on the DUC, and
being guaranteed that such a ν lies on the curve by the suﬃcient condition, we
have (cid:104)η, Lη(cid:105) = (cid:104)ν, Lν(cid:105), and hence

(cid:104)η, K(α)η(cid:105) = (cid:104)η, Lη(cid:105) − αx = (cid:104)ν, Lν(cid:105) − αx = (cid:104)ν, K(α)ν(cid:105) = q(α).

Therefore, η must also be a unit vector in σ(α).
We complete the proof by showing that for any x ∈ (0, λN−1) there is an α
and a unit norm eigenfunction ν ∈ σ(α) such that (cid:104)ν, ∆ν(cid:105) = x.
Given x ∈ (0, λN−1), parts (b) and (c) of Lemma 6.4 ensure that there
exist a(cid:48) < b(cid:48) such that H−(a(cid:48)) < x < H+(b(cid:48)) and that there are a < b with
a(cid:48) ≤ a < b ≤ b(cid:48) such that on the interval [a, b] there exists at most one point
β ∈ [a, b] at which H−(β) < H+(β). The interval [H−(a), H+(b)] can be written
as the union of three subintervals:

[H−(a), H+(b)] = [H−(a), H−(β)) ∪ [H−(β), H+(β)] ∪ (H+(β), H+(b)].

Thus, x must belong to one of these three intervals. If x is in the ﬁrst or third
subinterval, the continuity of H−(α) and H+(α), respectively, on these inter-
vals guarantees for some α−, respectively, α+ that H−(α−) = x, respectively,
H+(α+) = x, on one of these intervals. By the construction of the H± functions,
this also guarantees a ν achieving the DUC exists.

18

PAUL J. KOPROWSKI

It remains to be shown that such an α and ν exist for x ∈ [H−(β), H+(β)].

We set

ν+ = argmaxz∈σ(β),(cid:107)z(cid:107)=1 (cid:104)z, ∆z(cid:105) and ν− = argminz∈σ(β),(cid:107)z(cid:107)=1 (cid:104)z, ∆z(cid:105) ,

and deﬁne, for θ ∈ [0, π/2], the vector valued function,

ν(θ) =

cos θν+ + sin θν−

(1 + sin(2θ)(cid:104)ν+, ν−(cid:105))1/2

.

The assumption that H−(β) (cid:54)= H+(β) ensures that the denominator is nonzero.
The numerator has norm squared given by

(cid:107)cos θν+ + sin θν−(cid:107)2 = 1 + 2 cos θ sin θ (cid:104)ν+, ν−(cid:105) = 1 + sin(2θ)(cid:104)ν+, ν−(cid:105) ,

and so (cid:107)ν(θ)(cid:107) = 1. Further, ν(θ) is continuous and ν(θ) ∈ σ(β). By continuity,
the intermediate value theorem, and the fact that (cid:104)ν(π/2), ∆ν(π/2)(cid:105) = H−(β)
and (cid:104)ν(0), ∆ν(0)(cid:105) = H+(β), we have that there exists θ0 ∈ [0, π/2] such that
(cid:104)ν(θ0), ∆ν(θ0)(cid:105) = x.

7 The Complete Graph

Figure 3: Unit weighted complete graphs with N = 8 and N = 16 vertices.

Unit weighted graphs for which every vertex is connected directly to every
other vertex, as in Figure 3, are referred to as complete graphs. A complete
graph with N vertices has graph Laplacian L = N I − ON×N where ON×N is
an N × N matrix each of whose elements is 1. The minimal polynomial m(x)
for L is given by m(x) = x(x − N ), and the characteristic polynomial is c(x) =
x(x−N )N−1. As is the case with all connected graphs, the eigenspace associated

We shall compute the diﬀerential feasibility region for the complete graph

explicitly. We begin our analysis by analyzing the eigenspace of K(α).
Proposition 7.1 Let G be the unit weighted complete graph with N ≥ 3 ver-
tices. For all α (cid:54)= 0 ∈ R, if K(α) = L − α∆, where L is the graph Laplacian
for G and ∆ is its diagonalization, then K(α) has an N − 2 degree eigenspace
associated with the eigenvalue N (1 − α).

Proof: K(α) is a block matrix of the form

(cid:20) N − 1 −1∗

N−1
−1N−1 C(α)

(cid:21)

,

K(α) =

where 1N−1 is the (N−1)×1 constant function of all ones, and C(α) is the circu-
lant matrix with N − 1− N α on the diagonal and −1 at every other coordinate,
i.e.,

C(α) = N (1 − α)IN−1×N−1 − ON−1×N−1.

Let W ⊂ RN−1 be the orthogonal complement of span(1N−1) in RN−1. Then
for all w ∈ W we have that

C(α)w = N (1 − α)w − ON−1×N−1w = N (1 − α)w.

W has dimension N − 2 and may be embedded in l2(G) via the mapping w (cid:55)→

and the eigenspace ES(α) associated with N (1−α) has at least dimension N −2
as it properly contains ˜W . Let a and b denote the remaining two eigenvalues.
Let wa be an eigenvector associated with a and orthogonal to all w ∈ ˜W . Then
wa is of the form wa = c[x1...1]∗ for some real constant c. Without loss of
generality, we set c = 1 and we have

that equation (22) holds for all α ∈ R.

We conclude that ES(α) has dimension N − 2 as desired.
