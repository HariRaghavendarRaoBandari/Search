We study the strong decay channels P+

c (4380) → J/ψp and P+

c (4450) → J/ψp under Σc ¯D∗ molecular state
ansatz. With various spin-parity assignments, the partial decay widths of J/ψp ﬁnal state are calculated. Our
results show that all the P wave Σc ¯D∗ assignments are excluded, while S wave Σc ¯D∗ pictures for Pc(4380)
¯D∗ molecules are
and Pc(4450) are both allowed by present experimental data. The JP = 3/2− Σ∗c
¯D system for Pc(4380) is possible. More experimental
also discussed in heavy quark limit, and ﬁnd the Σ∗c
information on spin-parities and partial decay widths and theoretical investigations on other decay modes are
needed to clarify the nature of two Pc states.

The spin-parities of the Pc states are not determined yet, and
some possible spin-parity values (3/2−, 5/2+), (3/2+, 5/2−),
and (5/2+, 3/2−) for [Pc(4380), Pc(4450)] are favored by the
experimental analyses. Given the strong decay mode J/ψp,
the Pc(4380) and Pc(4450) states are believed to have ﬁve in-
trinsic quark content uudc¯c, and their isospins are I = 1/2.

In addition to the conventional mesons (q ¯q) and baryons

dibaryons, are also allowed by color conﬁnement. In the past
decades, lots of XYZ states have been observed, which can be
hardly described as conventional mesons in traditional quark
b states,
models [3–5]. Most of them, especially the Z+
should have four quark content. A resonance structure of
d∗(2380) has also been reported in double-pion fusion reac-
tions and the following partial wave analyses conﬁrm it as a
genuine state [6, 7], which indicating a six-quark nature. The
observation of two pentaquark states Pc(4380) and Pc(4450)
provides a unique perspective to the nature of exotic states.

c and Z+

Before the discovery of Pc states, there have already been
some theoretical studies on the existences of hidden charm
pentaquark states with meson-baryon and meson-meson in-
teractions [8–14]. Some hidden charm states are predicted,
which may correspond the Pc states or their partners. More-
over, the productions of these states are also discussed within
the framework of eﬀective Lagrangian approach [15–18].

Inspired by the observation of Pc states, many interesting
theoretical works have been presented. According to the di-
quark picture, the two Pc states are interpreted as compact
pentaquarks, where the ﬁve quarks are tightly bounded and
interact with each other via color magnetic interaction di-
rectly [19–25]. An alternative explanation is that the Pc res-
onances are molecular states composed of one meson and
one baryon, which are loosely bounded and interact through
color Van der Waals interaction and boson exchange interac-
tion [26–34]. Furthermore, the non-resonant interpretations
of these two structures also exist, which suggest that the Pc
states are not genuine states, but kinematical eﬀects due to re-
scattering processes [35–38]. Detailed discussions of various
assignments and properties can be found in Ref. [5, 39].

The production mechanism of these two Pc are also inves-
tigated by some works. Analogy to Λ0
b → J/ψK− p, the Pc
states and their partners can be produced in weak decay pro-
cesses of bottom baryons [40–46]. Since the anomalous trian-
gle singularity kinematical eﬀects do not exist in the two body
ﬁnal states reactions, the photon and pion induced produc-
tions are suggested to clarify the nature of Pc states [47–50].
Other production processes, such as heavy ion collisions [51],
proton-nucleus collisions [52], and Υ(1S ) → p ¯pJ/ψ reac-
tion [35], are also proposed.

Besides the mass spectrum and production mechanism, the
decay behaviors of Pc states can also provide beneﬁcial infor-
mation of their structures. However, there are only a few stud-
ies on decay properties. Burns discussed possible decay pat-
terns of Pc states under various scenarios according to quan-
tum number conservations [39]. Eides, Petrov and Polyakov
calculated the J/ψ partial decay width of Pc(4450) as a bound
state of charmonium ψ(2S ) and nucleon. Wang, Li, Liu and
Zhu performed a comprehensive study with the heavy quark
¯D,
symmetry and spin rearrangement scheme, where the Σ∗c
Σc ¯D∗, and Σ∗c ¯D∗ molecular candidates are considered [53]. In-
dependent of dynamical mechanism, several ratios of partial
widths of some decay channels are estimated. Particularly,
Wu, Molina, Oset, and Zou gave a pioneer investigation on
decay behaviors of the predicted hidden charm states [8].

It should be mentioned that the masses of Σc ¯D∗ systems
with diﬀerent partial waves have been extensively studied in
the literature. Some works suggested that Σc ¯D∗ molecule
stands for the Pc(4380) state [27, 31, 34], while others sup-
port it as Pc(4450) resonance [26, 29]. In present work, we
will investigate the strong decay mode J/ψp of Pc states under
Σc ¯D∗ molecule assignments with spin-parity JP = 3/2±, 5/2±.
Within the framework of eﬀective Lagrangian approach, the
technique for evaluating composite hadron systems have been
widely used for various molecular states, where the com-
positeness condition, corresponding to Z = 0 has been em-
¯D∗
ployed [54–60]. Moreover, the JP = 3/2− Σ∗c
molecules are also discussed in heavy quark limit. These ex-
plorations can give the predicted partial decay widths of Pc
states, which will help us to distinguish diﬀerent interpreta-
tions and be tested by future experiments.

¯D and Σ∗c

This paper is organized as follows. The basic formalisms
and ingredients of our approach are displayed in Sec. II. The
predicted partial decay widths and discussions are presented
in Sec. III. Finally, we give a short summary in the last section.

varies in diﬀerent systems.

The coupling constant gPcΣc ¯D∗ can be determined by the
compositeness condition [61, 62]. This condition requires that
the renormalization constant of the hadronic molecular wave

(21)

The coupling constants gPcΣc ¯D∗ of two Pc states with dif-
ferent spin-parity assignments are estimated in Σc ¯D∗ hadronic
molecular pictures from compositeness condition. The typ-
ical value of Λ is about 1 GeV, and the Λ dependence of
these coupling constants are shown in Fig. 3. When Λ varies
from 0.8 to 1.2 GeV, the coupling gPcΣc ¯D∗ decreases.
It is
known that for a S wave loosely bound state, the eﬀective
coupling strength of the bound state to its components is in-
sensitive to the inner structure and can be determined model-
independently [61, 64]. In our calculation, the coupling con-
stants are almost independent with the parameter Λ for the

The partial decay widths of P+

c → J/ψp are presented in
Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, and their values with Λ = 1 GeV are shown
in Table. II. In the discussed Λ range, the partial decay widths
increase with JP = 3/2± assignments, while decrease with
JP = 5/2± assignments. For the Pc(4380) state, the predicted
partial decay widths in four cases are all smaller than the ex-
perimental total width within the limit of error. The JP = 5/2−
assignment is not favored by LHCb experiment [1], and the
Σc ¯D∗ molecule should be in D wave in this case. Hence, the

JP = 5/2− assumption for Pc(4380) is excluded, while others
are consistent with the present data. For the Pc(4450) state,
since JP = 3/2+ assignment is not favored by LHCb collabo-
ration [1] and the calculated partial decay width is much larger
than the experimental total width, this case can be completely
excluded as well. Also, the JP = 5/2+ case is disfavored due
to the large predicted width, and the D wave Σc ¯D∗ molecule
with JP = 5/2− can be hardly formed through boson exchange
interaction and color Van der Waals interaction. Hence, only
S wave Σc ¯D∗ molecule is left for the Pc(4450) state.

narios are also proposed in the literature. We do not calcu-
¯D∗
late the partial decay widths of Pc states as Σ∗c
molecules due to the extremely complicated and lengthy pro-
cedures of loop integrals including higher spin states. In the
heavy quark limit, the S -wave D and D∗ mesons can be cat-
egorized into a doublet as well as the heavy baryons Σc and

The much larger partial decay width Γ
excludes the possibility of Pc(4450) as a S -wave JP = 3/2−
Σ∗c ¯D∗ molecule. Also, the Pc(4450) as the Σ∗c ¯D system is not
favored due to its higher mass over the threshold and a slightly
large partial decay width. The above discussion shows that if
Pc(4450) state has the spin-parity JP = 3/2−, only Σc ¯D∗ sys-
tem of the three molecular scenarios is allowed. This result is
consistent with the interpretations of Ref. [26], in which the
Pc(4450) is a JP = 3/2− Σc ¯D∗ resonance and Pc(4380) may
be not a genuine state.

It is worthy mentioned that the J/ψp mode of the two Pc
states may not be the dominated decay channel. The situation
occurs for the charged charmonium-like and bottomonium-
like states. Under the assumption that Zc(3885) and Zc(3900)
are the same state, the partial decay width of D ¯D∗ chan-

nel is larger than J/ψπ mode by a factor about 6 [65]. The
open-bottom decay modes of Zb(10610) and Zb(10650) are
also dominated [3].
In Refs. [5, 66], an argument sug-
(∗)
¯D(∗) molecules would mainly
gests that the Pc states as Σ
c
decay to open-charm channels, while Pc states as compact
pentaquark states should decay to hidden-charm modes dom-
inantly. Moreover, the charm-less decay channels are essen-
tial for the dynamically generated hidden-charm pentaquark
the branching ra-
states [8].
c (4380)→J/ψp[(Σc ¯D∗)], and
tios from Γ
c (4380)→J/ψp[(Σ∗c ¯D∗)] are up to 0.84 ± 0.36, 0.83 ± 0.35, and
3/2−

1.00 ± 0.43, respectively, which stand in sharp contrast to this
argument. Hence, the Pc(4380) as these assignments are dis-
favored.

Finally, the S -wave Σc ¯D∗ assignments for Pc(4380) and
Pc(4450) are both allowed by present experimental data, while
all the P-wave Σc ¯D∗ assumptions are excluded. Moreover,
¯D for
for the JP = 3/2− Σ∗c
Pc(4380) case is possible. It should be noted that these results
do not contradict with the fact that the two Pc states have dif-
ferent spins and opposite parities, since other cases such as
¯D∗ assumption are also possible and not discussed
P-wave Σ∗c
here. Theoretical investigations on other decay modes and
further experimental information on spin-parities and partial
decay widths will be helpful to distinguish these possible as-
signments of the Pc states.

IV. SUMMARY

In this work, we estimate the partial decay widths of
strong decay modes J/ψp of hidden charm pentaquark states
Pc(4380) and Pc(4450) in Σc ¯D∗ molecular scenarios. With
various spin-parity assignments, the partial decay widths of Pc
states are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent. All the P wave Σc ¯D∗ assign-
ments are excluded, while S wave Σc ¯D∗ pictures for Pc(4380)
and Pc(4450) are both possible. The JP = 3/2− Σ∗c ¯D and Σ∗c ¯D∗
molecular pictures are also discussed in heavy quark limit, and
only Σ∗c ¯D for Pc(4380) is allowed. More theoretical investiga-
tions on other decay behaviors and experimental information
on spin-parities and partial decay widths are needed to clarify
the nature of two Pc states.
