To understand the nature of the X(5568), recently observed in the mass spectrum of the B0

s π±
system by the D0 Collaboration, we have investigated, in a previous work, a scalar tetraquark
(diquak-antidiquark) structure for it, within the two-point QCD sum rules method. The result
found for its mass agrees well with the experimental value. Encouraged by this ﬁnding we now
s π± using the three-point QCD
extend our calculations to obtain the decay width of X(5568) to B0
sum rule. We obtain a value of (20.4 ± 8.7) MeV, which, on comparing with the experimental value
of 21.9 ± 6.4(sta)+5.0

−2.5(syst) MeV/c2, reinforces the scalar four quark nature of X(5568).

The D0 Collaboration has recently reported the study
of the B0
s π± mass spectrum in the energy range 5.5-
5.9 GeV, where a narrow enhancement of the experi-
mental data is found and interpreted as a new state:
X(5568) [1]. The mass and width for this state have been
found to be m = 5567.8 ± 2.9(sta)+0.9
−1.9(syst) MeV/c2 and
Γ = 21.9 ± 6.4(sta)+5.0
−2.5(syst) MeV/c2, respectively [1].
The isospin of X(5568) is clearly one. Its spin-parity is
not yet known although a scalar four quark interpretation
has been suggested in Ref. [1].

The ﬁnding of this new state adds to the rigor with
which the exotic hadrons with heavy quark ﬂavor are be-
ing studied currently. Until just about a decade ago, the
data related to the spectroscopy of hadrons with open
or hidden charm/bottom structure were relatively scarce
and of poor statistical quality. However, the scenario
has changed rapidly during the last few years with the
working of new experimental facilities like LHCb, BES,
BELLE, etc., and good quality experimental data is be-
ing published continuously. With suﬃcient amount of
data available, it has been possible to identify several new
states, actually way too many to ﬁt in the traditional
quark-antiquark spectrum.
Indeed, theoretical studies
indicate that many of these hadrons must be exotic in
nature. For example, the ﬁrst such state discovered in
the charm sector is the X(3872) [2] . The mass as well as
the narrow width of X(3872), Γ < 1.2 MeV [2], inspite
of having a large phase space for decay to some open
channels, cannot be explained within the conventional
quark model. A series of similar states have been found
and their structure, quantum numbers, etc., are being
debated continuously in the literature. Recently, even
clearer evidence of the exotic nature has been brought
forward with the ﬁnding of special mesons, which are
heavy quarkonium-like but at the same time are electri-
cally charged. Such states would at least require four va-
lence quarks to get the nonzero charge. Some examples
of such charged charmonium-like states are: Zc(3900),
Zc(4025), Zc(4250), Zc(4430) in the charm sector [3–6]
and Zb(10610), Zb(10650) [7] in the bottom sector. The
X(5568) is an addition to the list of undoubtedly exotic

mesons, since its wave function consists of four diﬀerent
ﬂavors: u, b, d and s quark.

investigations [8–16].

The observation of this new state has already mo-
tivated several theoretical
In
Refs. [8–11] the calculations for the mass of X(5568) have
been done using the QCD sum rules (QCDSR) method,
and results in excellent agreement with the experimen-
tal value have been found. In Refs. [8–10] J P C = 0++
was assumed while in Ref. [11] scalar as well as ax-
ial tetraquark currents were considered.
In Ref. [12] a
model using multiquark interactions has been used and
a 150 MeV higher mass is found for X(5568), although
the systematic errors still allow their state to be related
to X(5568). Another multiquark model calculations us-
ing color-magnetic interaction has been presented in [13].
The possibility of explaining the enhancement in the data
as near threshold rescattering eﬀects has been studied in
Ref. [14]. The B ¯K and B∗ ¯K molecular interpretations
have been suggested in Ref [15]. A calculation of the
width of X(5568) has also been reported in Ref. [16] us-
ing sum rules based on light cone QCD, but with a La-
grangian that is not usual, with derivatives in the heavy
particle ﬁelds and not in the pion ﬁeld.

To be consistent with our previous work [9], we con-
sider the X(5568) as a scalar diquark-antidiquark (in
analogy with the D±
s0(2317) description in Ref. [17]). In
order to corroborate our interpretation of the nature of
X ±(5568) [9], we now calculate its decay width to B0
s π±,
following the calculations of the analogous decay in the
charm sector done in Ref. [18]. Due to its low mass,
the channels B ¯K, B∗ ¯K ∗ and B∗0
s ρ are closed for the de-
cay of this state. With the 0++ spin-parity assignment,
X ±(5568) cannot decay to the other possible open chan-
nel B∗0
s π±. Further, the radiative decay is allowed only
for the neutral partner of the X ±(5568). Thus, X ±(5568)
to B0
s π± decay width should be comparable to the exper-
imental total width [1].

In Ref. [9] we reproduced the mass of X ±(5568) by con-
sidering it as a scalar diquark-antidiquark pair described
by the interpolating ﬁeld:

jX = ǫabcǫdec(uT

a Cγ5bb)( ¯ddγ5C ¯sT

e ),

(1)

where a, b, c, ... are colour indices, C is the charge con-
jugation matrix.

To calculate the vertex, X +(5568)B0

s π+, we use the

three-point correlation function

Γµ(p, p′, q) =

s (x)jπ

X (0)]|0i,

where p = p′ + q and the interpolating currents for the
pion and B0

s mesons are given by:

5µ = ¯daγµγ5ua,
jπ
s = i¯baγ5sa.
jB0

(3)

As the standard procedure in the QCDSR calculations
[19, 20], we use the dual interpretation of the correlation
function and assume that there is an interval over which
Eq. (2) may be equivalently described at the quark as
well as the hadron level. Following this assumption:

1. On the OPE side, the vertex function of Eq. (2) is
calculated in terms of quark and gluon ﬁelds using
the Wilson’s operator product expansion (OPE).

2. On the phenomenological side, the same function
is then calculated by treating the currents as the
creation and annihilation operators of hadrons and
as a result hadron properties, such as masses and
coupling constants, are introduced in the process.

3. Finally, both results are equated to extract the
value of the coupling constant required to obtain
the width of the state.

The phenomenological side is calculated by inserting
s , π+ and X(5568) in Eq. (2),

intermediate states for B0
and by using the deﬁnitions:

5µ|π(q)i = iqµFπ,

The second term on the right-hand side in Eq. (7) con-

tains the contributions of all possible excited states.

We follow Refs. [18, 21] and work at the pion pole, as
suggested in [22] for the pion-nucleon coupling constant.

2

We do this because the matrix element in Eq. (8) deﬁnes
the coupling constant only at the pion pole. For q2 6= 0
one would have to replace de coupling constant gXB0
s π,
s π(q2) and, therefore,
in Eq. (8), by the form factor gXB0
one would have to deal with the complications associated
with the extrapolation of the form factor [23, 24]. The
pion pole method consists in neglecting the pion mass in
the denominator of Eq. (7) and working at q2 = 0. On
the OPE side one singles out the leading terms in the op-
erator product expansion of Eq.(2) that match the 1/q2
term. On the other hand, from phenomenological side,
we get the following expression for the qµ/q2 structure,

uum thresholds for X(5568) and B0

we are working at q2 = 0, we take the limit p2 = p′2 and
we apply the Borel transformation to p2 → M 2 and get:

where the second and third terms in Eq. (10) stands for
the pole-continuum transitions and pure continuum con-
tributions. For simplicity, one assumes that the pure
continuum contribution to the spectral density, ρcc(u), is
related to the spectral density obtained on the OPE side,
ρOP E(u), through the ansatz: ρcc(u) = ρOP E(u)Θ(u −
u0).
large partial decay
widths are expected when the coupling constant is ob-
tained from QCDSR in the case of multiquark states, that
contains the same valence quarks as the valence quarks
in the ﬁnal state. This happens because, although the
initial current, Eq. (1), has a non-trivial color structure,
it can be rewritten as a sum of molecular type currents
with trivial color conﬁguration through a Fierz transfor-
mation, as explicitly shown in Ref. [11]. To avoid this
problem we follow Refs. [21, 26], and consider on the
OPE side only diagrams with non-trivial color structure,
which are called color-connected (CC) diagrams.

On the OPE side we compute the CC diagrams work-
ing at leading order in αs. Singling out the leading terms
proportional to qµ/q2, up to dimension ﬁve the only dia-
grams that contribute are proportional to the mixed con-
densate. We can write the Borel transformation of the

persion relation:

In Fig. 1 we show the OPE side of the sum rule (right-
hand side of Eq. (12)), for √s0 = 6.0 GeV and √u0 =
5.866 GeV, as a function of the Borel mass. We can see
that the OPE shows good stability up to M 2 ≤ 2.2 GeV2.
Therefore, in our analysis we will consider the window for
the Borel mass in the range 1.0 GeV2 ≤ M 2 ≤ 2.2 GeV2.

parameter C from the ﬁt, we can extract the value of the
coupling constant using Eq. (13) and the parameters in
Table I. The value obtained for the coupling constant is
gXB0

Sπ = 10.3 GeV.

The result obtained for the coupling shows a large de-
pendence on the parameters s0 and λX . To determine
the error introduced by these parameters, we allow s0

to vary in the interval 5.9 ≤ √s0 ≤ 6.1 GeV (the same

interval used in the study of the mass in Ref. [9]), and
the error for the λX shown in Table. 1. Considering the
uncertainties given above, we ﬁnally ﬁnd:

gXB0

Sπ = (10.3 ± 2.3) GeV .

(14)

It is important to point out that this coupling has the
same dimension as the usual coupling between one scalar
and two pseudoscalar mesons [29]. This is not the case
of the XBsπ coupling determined in Ref. [16], which is
given in units of GeV−1, since the authors use a higher
dimension interaction Lagrangian, with two derivatives
in the heavy particle ﬁelds.

In summary, we have presented a QCD sum rule study
of the vertex function associated with the strong decay
X(5568)+ → B0
s π+, using a three-point function QCD
sum rule approach. Following the study presented in [9],
the X(5568) meson was considered as a scalar diquark-
antidiquark state. To extract directly the coupling con-
stant from the sum rule we work at the pion pole and
we consider only color connected diagrams to ensure the
non-trivial color structure of the tetraquark current. The
value obtained for the gXB0
s π coupling was used to eval-
uate the decay width for this channel. We have obtained
a decay width that is in excellent agreement with the
total experimental width. This result is also consistent
with the scalar meson hypothesis, since in this case the
s π+ is the only strong one that is
channel X +(5568) → B0
available and, therefore, the total width should be very
close to the width in this channel.
