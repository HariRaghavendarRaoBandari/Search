An alternative measure of solar activity from detailed
sunspot datasets

J. Murak¨ozy · T. Baranyi · A. Ludm´any

c(cid:13) Springer ••••

Abstract The sunspot number is analyzed by using detailed sunspot data,
including aspects of observability, sunspot sizes, and proper identiﬁcation of
sunspot groups as discrete entities of the solar activity. The tests show that
besides the subjective factors there are also objective causes of the ambiguities
in the series of sunspot numbers. To introduce an alternative activity measure
the physical meaning of the sunspot number has to be reconsidered. It contains
two components whose numbers are governed by diﬀerent physical mechanisms,
this is one source of the ambiguity. This article suggests an activity index, which
is the amount of emerged magnetic ﬂux. The only long-term proxy measure is
the detailed sunspot area dataset with proper calibration to the magnetic ﬂux
amount. The Debrecen sunspot databases provide an appropriate source for the
establishment of the suggested activity index.

Keywords: sunspots, solar activity

1. Introduction

It is a common problem of all long-term studies in astronomy and space physics
that their empirical backgrounds, the observed datasets are necessarily inhomo-
geneous because of the large variety of data sources and uneven observational
coverage. The causes of the inhomogeneities are various. During the centuries
several circumstances may be modiﬁed substantially, e.g. the atmospheric see-
ing, instrumental background (mainly optics), and registration technique (vi-
sual, graphic, photographic, electronic). Subjective causes of the inhomogeneity
may be the diﬀerences between the members of generations of observers, their
personal biases and also mistakes.

The Sunspot Number (Rz), the most important, indispensable long-term pa-
rameter of the level of solar activity, was introduced by Rudolf Wolf in 1848
at the Z¨urich Eidgen¨ossische Sternwarte. He reconstructed the Rz by collecting

and studying all earlier observations made after 1610. The next directors of the
observatory, Alfred Wolfer, Wilhelm Brunner and Max Waldmeier continued his
work. Although the observing instrument, the strategy and seeing were more or
less identical, the perfect long term homogeneity could not be guaranteed. This
dataset is currently continued by the SILSO team at the Royal Observatory,
Brussels (Clette et al., 2007).

Clette et al. (2014) conducted a thorough analysis of the homogeneity prob-
lems of the sunspot number and identiﬁed some causes of the discontinuities
in the long term variations. They have carried out the necessary corrections to
improve the homogeneity of the datasets of the sunspot number and the group
sunspot number (Hoyt and Schatten, 1998) as well as the variation of their ratio.
The corrected dataset provides an improved view of the long term variation of
solar activity.

The present work has two aims: on the one hand testing the classic deﬁnition
of the sunspot number with detailed datasets, in particular with sunspot area
data, on the other hand testing a proposed new solar activity parameter based
on detailed sunspot data.

2. Problems with the Wolf number

2.1. Observational problems

The tremendous importance of the sunspot number in long term studies is un-
questionable but some limitations may be worth mentioning. One of the critical
issues in determining the sunspot number is the observability of sunspots. This
does not only mean a pure technical or seeing problem that could be eliminated
by averaging the inputs of many sources, it has a principal constraint: the center-
limb variation of the observability of sunspots. Figure 1 shows the numbers
of sunspots of diﬀerent areas detected in longitudinal bins of 10 degrees at
increasing longitudinal distances from the Central Meridian (LCM).

It can be seen that the numbers of observed spots strongly depend on both
their sizes and distances from the central region. The two diagrams also demon-
strate that the spatial resolution of the instruments has a non negligible impact
on the result, the SDD data (SOHO/MDI Debrecen Data, left panel) are based
on SOHO/MDI observations whose resolution is low to detect areas of 1 MSH
(Millionth of Solar Hemisphere) so the maximum is at 2 MSH. The inputs to
the DPD (Debrecen Photoheliographic Data) are the Debrecen/Gyula ground
based observations, these have higher resolution, thus the weight of 1 MSH spots
is larger in this sample. However, the center-limb variation is a more serious
problem than a simple instrumental limit, it means that the chance of observing
a sunspot is in principle lower close to the limb than close to the center. This
diﬀerence decreases in the cases of larger spots but it is not neglectable even for
areas of 5 MSH. This is not a subjective restriction.

This LCM-dependence imposes the same constraint on each input dataset of
ISSN, it cannot cause hidden jumps. However, it makes questionable, whether the
daily sunspot number is a real measure of the activity. It may have a signiﬁcant

daily variability even if all spots remain the same during two weeks, just because
of the variable observability. The monthly values are presumably real.

This observability problem raises the question whether we should omit the
spots below an area limit. This could be a subjective intervention. Figure 2
shows the comparison of the daily values of ISSN and the Wolf number of
Debrecen during 1989, the latter was computed by using the data of DPD with
an observatory constant of unity. The ﬁgure shows the impact of omitting spots
of size 1 MSH as well as all spots smaller than 5 MSH. The number of considered
spots strongly aﬀects the result.

2.2. Methodological problems

Another question may also be raised. How robust is the Wolf-deﬁnition? More
speciﬁcally, what is the real weight of a group which has been chosen to be 10

the sunspot groups in the DPD era, between 1977 and 2014. see Figure 3. It can
be seen that the weight of 10 is exaggerating on an average, although several
groups may contain more than 10 spots.

As is well known the deﬁnition of the Group Sunspot Number (Hoyt and
Schatten, 1998) contains a correction factor of 12.08 between the GSN and
Rz. This value may also indicate a small mean number of spots per group in
the historical observations contributing to the Rz. Clette et al. (2014) reports
gradually diminishing GSN/ISSN ratio from 12.8 to 11.0 between cycles 19 and

Figure 4. Comparison of the ISSN (dashed line, scaled at right) in cycles 21–23 with the Wolf
number computed from the DPD (scaled at left) by considering all spots (continuous line),
and omitting spots smaller than 5 MSH (dashed dot line).

Figure 3 may mean that the variation of this ratio has also cyclic and mid-term
components.

Figure 4 shows the comparison of the monthly mean ISSN and the number
of all spots and spots larger than 5 MSH disregarding the groups during cycles
21–23 by using DPD data. These curves also show a strong dependence on the
considered spot sizes.

There is a further methodological property which does not diminish the am-
biguity, the redundant contribution of sunspot groups to the sunspot number.
After the ﬁrst appearance a group may exhibit rapid development and in the
consecutive days it has varying contributions to the daily sunspot number. In
such a way the variation of the sunspot number contains the mixed evolutional
histories of several groups and these are smoothed out in the monthly ISSN
values, although the contribution of an active region to the level of overall activity
is only relevant once: at its maximum state.

2.3. Problem of the physical meaning of the Wolf-deﬁnition

Besides the observational constraints a conceptual remark can also be made on
the Wolf-deﬁnition, namely, its physical meaning is ambiguous. Wolf considered
the numbers of both the sunspot groups and the individual spots to be measures
of the solar activity level. These two numbers, however, are signatures of two
diﬀerent physical mechanisms.

The level of activity is characterised by the amount of the emerging magnetic
ﬂux, in other terms, the number of active regions and the ﬂux carried to them
from the toroidal ﬁeld. In contrast, the number of individual spots within an
active region is resulted by a fragmentation process during the ﬂux emergence.
Fan et al. (1993) described a mechanism in which the plasma within the emerging
ﬂux ropes is carried towards the trailing part of the active region due to the
Coriolis force and this results in the disintegration and dispersion of the spots of
following polarity. In our previous paper (Murak¨ozy et al., 2014) we examined
this fragmentation asymmetry on a large statistical sample and found that the
leading part is generally more compact than the following one, it contains less

and larger spots while the following part is more dispersed in the maximum state
of the sunspot group development.

We suggest that for the assessment of the solar activity level the amount of
the emerged ﬂux should be used. The sum of all emerged ﬂuxes measured in
the active regions during a cycle can be regarded as a proxy measure of the
magnitude of the toroidal ﬂux which is the source of the active regions.

3. Total Amount of Emerged Magnetic Flux

The sunspot area datasets allow the amount of magnetic ﬂux carried onto the
solar surface to be calculated. This procedure needs a calibration function be-
tween the umbral area and the mean magnetic ﬁeld enclosed in the umbra. This
dependence is shown in Figure 5 which has been plotted by using the SDD data,
i.e. SOHO/MDI observations. The sample consists of 44.780 sunspots, they were
taken from the 10◦ environment of the solar disc center in order to minimize the
rate of magnetic ﬁeld line deviations from the line-of-sight. The diagram does
not distinguish between the magnetic polarities because they show the same
relationship. The curve ﬁtted to the points gives the area (A) – magnetic ﬁeld
(B) relationship by the following formula:

B = 0.04 · logA + 0.07

(1)

where A is measured in Millionth of Solar Hemisphere (MSH) and B in Tesla.

By representing the B mean ﬂux density with this function f (A) the ﬂux
amount within the umbra can be written as f (A) · A . The total magnetic ﬂux
(TMF) carried by an active region can be represented in the following form:

T M F = K · [Σf (Ai) · Ai]LP

(2)

where Ai : Area of i-th umbra (corrected for the geometrical foreshortening),
f (Ai) = Bi the mean magnetic ﬁeld of the i-th umbra, K: ratio of the total and
umbral ﬂuxes in the active region, LP: leading polarity.

Figure 6. Variation of the SSN (Wolf-number) during 24 hours in 1 November 1998.

The TMF should be computed in the maximum phase of a sunspot group
because the most developed state shows the total amount of emerged ﬂux, this
also excludes the above mentioned multiple contribution of an active region to
the ﬁnal result. The restriction to the subgroup of leading polarity ensures that
the ﬂux is not taken into account twice, furthermore, the leading part is more
reliable because of the above mentioned leading-following asymmetry. The K
correction factor takes into account the amount of small dispersed ﬂux ropes
belonging to the active region out of the umbrae of high ﬂux density. K is
regarded to be unity in the present study, it will be determined in a later work
on a large sample for further reﬁnement of the procedure.

The advantage of the above parameter is that it avoids the necessity of cor-
recting the LOS magnetic ﬁeld measurements for all positions on the solar disc,
it only considers the corrected umbral areas and the (1) calibration function.
The correction for the geometrical foreshortening is more reliable than for the
apparent variation of the magnetic ﬁeld across the disc. Figure 6 shows that the
daily determination of the sunspot number may strongly depend on the time
of observation even within 24 hours. The TMF helps to get rid of the role of
sampling in the scatter of the result.

To produce a time series of the emerged ﬂux a speciﬁc database has been
made for the SOHO/MDI era by using the SDD sunspot data (Gy˝ori et al.,
2011). This database contains the list of all observed sunspot groups, the time
of their maximum state and the list of all individual spots within the group with
their corrected areas and magnetic polarities at the time of the maximum. This
is the basis of computing their total magnetic ﬂuxes, the above parameter TMF
in (2).

Figure 7 compares the variation of a sunspot group during its passage through
the solar disc computed by the Wolf-deﬁnition as if it was the only group on the
disc (the calibration factor is 1) and the variation of its total magnetic ﬂux. This
latter is more reliable as can be checked visually in the html-presentation of the
SDD catalogue (http://fenyi.solarobs.unideb.hu/SDD/2000/index.html).

It is reasonable to plot the variation of TMF monthly, because all active
regions are considered only once. The monthly sums of TMFs are plotted in
Figure 8 for the entire disc and for both hemispheres.

Solar Activity Measure

The TMF-contributions of all active regions can be summed up for an entire
cycle and this can give a measure of the toroidal magnetic ﬁeld strength in the
given time interval. Between 1997 and 2010 the sum of all TMFs was 4960.4 Wb
on the northern hemisphere and 5695.5 Wb on the southern hemisphere.

Two remarks can be made. The maximum state can only be the maximum
observed state which is not necessarily the true maximum because one can only
follow the active regions until the western limb. All activity parameters are
aﬀected by this sampling restriction.

The other remark concerns the (1) calibration function. We do not consider
it a ﬁnal version of the area-magnetic ﬁeld relationship, but at present it can
be regarded as an acceptable function following the recalibration of the MDI
magnetograms (Tran et al., 2005). Upgrades of the calibration function may be
motivated either by improved magnetic ﬁeld measuring techniques to get rid of
the saturation of magnetic data (Liu et al., 2007), or by intrinsic solar trends in
the magnetic ﬂux density within spots, see e.g. Livingston and Penn (2009) and
Penn and Livingston (2011). Any later reﬁned functions will allow the TMF to
be recomputed.

This procedure needs detailed sunspot area data but the currently available
datasets do not yet allow to make long-term investigation of the TMF variations.
The most detailed materials are the SDD used here and the DPD also mentioned
in Subsection 2.1 covering cycles 21–24, the precision of their area data is about
10%. Cross calibrations of the available datasets are also necessary see. e.g.
Baranyi et al. (2001), Balmaceda et al. (2005) and Baranyi et al. (2013).

4. Conclusions

The presented proxy of the solar activity level, the total emerged magnetic ﬂux
(TMF) is physically more meaningful than the classic sunspot number deﬁned
by Wolf. This does not diminish the importance of the sunspot number that
will remain the most important and indispensable long term proxy of the solar
activity, especially in its recent form recalibrated by Clette et al (2014). We
present here a possible approach for the determination of the TMF and its
variation during cycle 23.

Advantages of the suggested new parameter:
The TMF, the Total Magnetic Flux emerged within an active region (AR) see
formula (2), is a physical quantity expressed in Weber in contrast to the sunspot
number whose values can only be interpreted within the dataset itself.

The TMF of an AR has a well deﬁned physical meaning, it is not contaminated

with non-activity measures (sunspot fragmentation).

The TMF is also free from redundant contributions of consecutive days which
also contaminates the sunspot number dataset with the evolution data of in-
dividual ARs. All ARs are considered once, at their maximum state but their
reappearance has not been investigated here.

The contribution of small spots has less impact on the TMF than on the
sunspot number because of the steeply diminishing ﬂux density toward smaller
umbrae (see Figure 5).

J. Murak¨ozy et al.

Each AR has its own TMF contribution to the overall activity, their sum over
a cycle may be a proxy measure of the strength of the toroidal ﬁeld in the given
cycle. In the interval 1997–2010 the sum of all TMFs was 4960.4 Wb on the
northern hemisphere and 5695.5 Wb on the southern hemisphere. The north-
south diﬀerence can obviously not be characterized by this parameter alone,
other features may exhibit diﬀerent rates but it can be a relevant factor in the
hemispheric asymmetry of the activity and presumably also in the asymmetry
of the interplanetary ﬁeld.

The following open questions remain for later studies:
The observational basis of this study is the SDD database, at present the
only material allowing the determination of this proxy because no other datasets
contain data for both the sunspot groups and sunspots along with their magnetic
ﬁelds. This only allows the study of cycle 23.

The K correction factor in (2) will be targeted in a subsequent analysis to

have a more reliable assessment of the entire emerged ﬂux amount.

The procedure remains always open to recompute the ﬂux amount if the
B = f (A) function in (1) will be upgraded by more precise magnetic ﬁeld
measurements.

The extension of the procedure for longer datasets with no magnetic data will
need additional assumptions, primarily about the typical ratio of the leading and
following parts in the most developed phase of the group, because the procedure
is built on the leading part.

The aim is to have a parameter describing the solar activity which is not a
mere number but it is a well deﬁned physical quantity, the magnetic ﬂux ap-
pearing at the solar surface. The cyclic sum of these quantities may characterize
the total toroidal magnetic ﬂux.
