RIGIDITY OF AN ISOMETRIC SL(3, R)-ACTION

RA ´UL QUIROGA-BARRANCO AND ELI ROBLERO-M´ENDEZ

Abstract. We characterize the universal covering of connected analytic pseu-
do-Riemannian manifolds which admit a non-trivial and isometric action of
the simple Lie group SL(3, R) with a dense orbit preserving a ﬁnite volume. If
such manifold is also weakly irreducible we prove that M is isometric to, or a
quotient space of, a simple Lie group containing SL(3, R).

Introduction

Let G be a connected non-compact simple Lie group acting on a connected,
analytic manifold M preserving a pseudo-Riemannian structure. It is conjectured
that such actions are rigid in the sense that they restrict the possibilities of the
manifold. It is expected that any such actions, under non-trivial conditions, must
be an algebraic double coset. That is, M ∼= K\H/Γ, such that H is a Lie group
and there is a group homomorphism G ֒→ H whose image commutes with K, a
compact subgroup of H, and Γ ⊂ H is a lattice. Therefore, the G-action is given by
a natural left action on M ∼= K\H/Γ. Some results in this direction are obtained
in [7] and [8], proving that with some extra geometric conditions such G-actions
imply that the manifolds are of double-coset type.

In [7], for M a complete and weakly irreducible manifold with a non-transitive
G-action and with a dense orbit, it is proved that the dimension of M has a lower
bound, in terms of the theoretical properties of the corresponding representation of

g, the Lie algebra of G. In particular, [7] explains in detail the case G = gSO0(p, q),

with p + q ≥ 4, determining the manifold M .

The paper applies the techniques from [7] to the case G = SL(3, R), a connected,
simple Lie group with Lie algebra sl(3, R). In our case, SL(3, R) acts isometrically
on M , a complete, pseudo-Riemannian manifold such that 8 < dim(M ) ≤ 14 with
a dense orbit. The assumption on the dimension of M eliminates the condition of
non-transitivity of the action.

In [7] and [8] we observe the study of irreducible representations of groups pre-
serving a non-degenerate, symmetric, bilinear form. Such study is an important
tool to understand the normal bundle of the foliation generated by the action of
the group. That understanding together with the properties of the tangent bundle
of the foliation give us information which restrict the possibilities of the manifold
M .

Here, we analyze the representation of SL(3, R) of minimal dimension with the
property of preserving a non-degenerate, symmetric bilinear form, which is non-
irreducible. Hence, this paper generalizes such corresponding part of the previous
works.

As in [7], we obtain a lower bound on the dimension of M which strongly deter-

mines fM , the universal covering of M . This is the result of our main theorem.

Theorem A. Let M be a connected analytic pseudo-Riemannian manifold. Sup-
pose that M is complete, has ﬁnite volume and admits an analytic and isometric

SL(3, R)-action with a dense orbit. If 8 < dim(M ) ≤ 14, then fM is isomorphic to

one, and only one, of the following:

(i) fSL(3, R) × eN , where eN is a complete pseudo-Riemannian manifold.

(ii) G2(2), the simply connected real Lie group related to the non-compact real

form of the exceptional simple Lie algebra gC
2 .

(iii) R\fSL(4, R).

Recall that a connected pseudo-Riemannian manifold is weakly irreducible if
there is no proper, non-degenerate invariant subspace of the tangent space at some
(at hence any) point invariant under the restricted holonomy group at that point.
If in the hypothesis of Theorem A we assume that the manifold M is weakly irre-
ducible then case (i) is no allowed, that is:

Theorem B. Let M be a connected analytic pseudo-Riemannian manifold. Sup-
pose that M is complete, has ﬁnite volume and admits an analytic and isometric
SL(3, R)-action with a dense orbit. If 8 < dim(M ) ≤ 14 and M is a weakly irre-

ducible manifold, then fM is isomorphic to one of the following:

(1) G2(2).

(2) R\fSL(4, R).

The corresponding isomorphism is fSL(3, R)-equivariant, where the fSL(3, R)-action
on it is induced by some non-trivial homomorphism of fSL(3, R) into G2(2) or
fSL(4, R), respectively. We can also rescale the metric along fSL(3, R)-orbits and
bi-invariant pseudo-Riemannian metric on G2(2) or on R\fSL(4, R) is given by the

their normal bundle to assume that such isomorphism is a local isometry for the

Killing form of g2(2) or sl(4, R), respectively.

Aditionally, if we assume that the universal covering of the manifold is not iso-
metric to a quotient space then the option (1) can be eliminated in the previous

theorem. This, fM ∼= G2(2) and M is isometric to a quotient of G2(2) over a discrete

subgroup. Which is the result of the next theorem.

Theorem C. Let M be a connected analytic pseudo-Riemannian manifold. Sup-
pose that M is complete, has ﬁnite volume and admits an analytic and isometric
SL(3, R)-action with a dense orbit. If 8 < dim(M ) ≤ 14 and M is a weakly ir-

reducible manifold such that fM is not isomorphic to a quotient map then there

exist

• a lattice Γ ⊂ G2(2), and
• an analytic ﬁnite covering map ϕ : G2(2)/Γ → M

such that ϕ is fSL(3, R)-equivariant map, where the fSL(3, R)-action on G2(2)/Γ is
induced by some non-trivial homomorphism fSL(3, R) → G2(2). We can also rescale
the metric along fSL(3, R)-orbits and their normal bundle to assume that ϕ is a

local isometry for the bi-invariant pseudo-Riemannian metric on G2(2) given by the
Killing form of its Lie algebra.

The proofs of Theorems A, B and C are based on the application of representation

theory to the Killing vector ﬁelds that centralize the action of the group fSL(3, R).

RIGIDITY OF AN ISOMETRIC SL(3, R)-ACTION

A fundamental result for this work is Proposition 2.2, which appears in [7] and [9]
and whose detailed proof can be found in [10]. Such proposition shows the existence

that we denote by H. The analysis of such properties of H lead us to identify the

of a subalgebra of Killing vector ﬁelds on fM which vanish at some ﬁxed point. The
previous algebra is used to show properties of the centralizer of the fSL(3, R)-action,
possible options of fM .

The organization of this paper is the following: In Section 1 we present the
minimal dimension representation W of sl(3, R) preserving a metric and therefore
the decomposition of so(W ) as a direct sum of irreducible sl(3, R)-modules.
In
Section 2, we show results that guarantee the existence of the centralizer of the
action on the manifold M . In Section 3 we study the properties of the centralizer
as a sl(3, R)-module which lead us to obtain a lower bound of the dimension of M .
In Section 4, we analyze the structure of the centralizer that permits to restrict the
possibilities of the manifold M . Finally, in Section 5, we use the previous result to
prove Theorems A, B and C.

1. Autodual non-trivial Representations of sl(3, R)

Recall that SL(3, R) denotes the special linear group of degree 3 over the ﬁeld
of real numbers. The group SL(3, R) is a connected, non-compact, real simple Lie
group and Lie algebra denoted as sl(3, R).

Let ρ be a representation of sl(3, R) on the real vector space V0 which induces
a complex representation ρ(C) : sl(3, C) → V , where V = V0 ⊗ C.
If a non-
trivial representation ρ preserves a non-degenerated symmetric bilinear form then
the representation ρ(C) is autodual.

By the Weyl Character Formula, the lower dimensions of non-trivial irreducible
representations of sl(3, C) are 3, 6 and 8. Where 3 is the dimension of the natural
representation of SL(3, C) onto C3 or onto its dual C3∗
, which are non-autodual.
Therefore, one can see that the non-trivial representations of sl(3, R) with dimension
less than 6 are non-autodual.

The previous result is useful to show that the minimum dimension of a non-trivial

representation of sl(3, R) is 6, which is a corollary of the next lemma.

Lemma 1.1. The minimal non-trivial real representation of sl(3, R) preserving a
non-degenerated bilinear symmetric form is isomorphic to R3 ⊕ R3∗. That bilinear
form has signature (3, 3).

Proof. Let ρ : sl(3, R) → V0 be a non-trivial real representation preserving a non-
degenerated symmetric bilinear form h·, ·i0. By the above we have that dimR(V0) ≥
6.

First, we assume that dimR(V0) = 6. If ρ is an irreducible representation then
ρ(C) is a complex irreducible representation. Therefore, Section 13 of [3] implies
V ≃ Sym2(C3) or V ≃ Sym2(C3∗).
In both cases, the representation is non-
autodual.

On the other hand, if ρ is reducible (and therefore ρ(C) is also reducible) then
C,

V is isomorphic to one of the following vector spaces: L6

Next, we prove the existence of a non-degenerated symmetric bilinear form h·, ·i0
in R3 ⊕ R3∗ which is sl(3, R)-invariant. Let v, v′ ∈ R3 ⊕ R3∗ be given, then there
exist unique elements p, p′ ∈ R3, q, q′ ∈ R3∗ such that v = (p, q) and v′ = (p′, q′).
We deﬁne hv, v′i0 as follows

j=1

hv, v′i0 = h(p, q), (p′, q′)i0 := q(p′) + q′(p),

where q(p) is the evaluation of the element q in the vector p. Note that hv, v′i0 is a
non-degenerated symmetric non-degenerated bilinear form. Let A be an arbitrary
but ﬁxed element of sl(3, R) then,

hA · v, v′i + hv, A · v′i0 = hA · (p, q), (p′, q′)i0 + h(p, q), A · (p′, q′)i0

= h(A · p, A · q), (p′, q′)i0 + h(p, q), (A · p′, A · q′)i0
= (A · q)(p′) + q′(A · p) + q(A · p′) + (A · q′)(p)
= q(−A · p′) + q′(A · p) + q(A · p′) + q′(−A · p)
= 0,

which proves that h·, ·i0 is sl(3, R)-invariant.

Now, let h·, ·i be a non-degenerated symmetric bilinear form on R3 ⊕ R3∗ which
If {e1, e2, e3} denotes the canonical basis of R3 then, given

is sl(3, R)-invariant.
i, j ∈ {1, 2, 3} such that i 6= j, we can ﬁnd an element Aij ∈ sl(3, R) such that

The sl(3, R)-invariance of h·, ·i implies that

Aij (ei) = ei

and

Aij (ej).

0 = hAij (ei), eji + hei, Aij (ej)i = 2hei, eji,

hence hei, eji = 0. Thus, the signature of the bilinear form h·, ·i0 on R3 ⊕ R3∗ is
(3, 3).
(cid:3)

Since the Lie algebra sl(3, R) preserves a non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form
on R3 ⊕ R3∗ with signature (3, 3), there exists a non-trivial Lie algebra homomor-
phism sl(3, R) → so(3, 3). The simplicity of sl(3, R) implies that such homomor-
phism is injective and therefore so(3, 3) has a structure of sl(3, R)-module.

Next, we analyze the decomposition of so(3, 3) into a direct sum of irreducible

sl(3, R)-submodules.

From Table II in [1], (cid:0)so(3, 3), gl(3, R)(cid:1) is a symmetric pair where gl(3, R) =

sl(3, R) ⊕ R is its decomposition as a direct sum of irreducible sl(3, R)-modules.

Lemma 1.2. so(3, 3) is isomorphic, as a sl(3, R)-module, to sl(3, R)⊕R3 ⊕R3∗ ⊕R.

Proof. In general, Table II in [1], shows (cid:0)so(n, n), sl(n, R) ⊕ R(cid:1) is a symmetric pair

such that

so(n, n) = sl(n, R) ⊕ R ⊕ ν2(sl(3, R))

where ν2(sl(3, R)) is a self-adjoint sl(n, R)-module containing π2(sl(n, R)), the irre-
ducible representation of sl(n, R) correspondent to its second fundamental weight
̟2. Using a similar analysis, about self-adjoint representations, of Appendix A in
[8] we have that ν2(sl(3, R)) = π2(sl(n, R)) ⊕ πn−2(sl(n, R)).

In the case n = 3 we have that π2(sl(3, R)) = R3∗

and π1(sl(3, R)) = R3.

Therefore

so(3, 3) = sl(3, R) ⊕ R ⊕ R3 ⊕ R3∗

.

(cid:3)

The following corollary is a consequence of the previous lemma.

Corollary 1.3. The subalgebras of so(3, 3) that are at the same time sl(3, R)-
submodules, with the structure of module induced by an injection of sl(3, R) into
so(3, 3), are isomorphic to one of the following: 0, sl(3, R), R3, R3∗, R, sl(3, R)⊕R3,
sl(3, R) ⊕ R3∗, sl(3, R) ⊕ R, R3 ⊕ R, R3∗ ⊕ R, sl(3, R) ⊕ R3 ⊕ R, sl(3, R) ⊕ R3∗ ⊕ R
or to so(3, 3).

Proof. We only recall that (cid:0)so(3, 3), sl(3, R) ⊕ R(cid:1) is a symmetric pair.

2. Isometric actions of the simple Lie group SL(3, R)

In this section we assume G is a connected non-compact simple Lie group with
Lie algebra g and M a connected and analytic ﬁnite-volume pseudo-Riemannian
manifold where G acts analytic and isometrically with a dense orbit.

Since every isometric G-action on a manifold M with a dense orbit is locally free
(see [11]), the orbits of the G-action deﬁne a foliation that we denote by F . Then, for
every x ∈ M there exist a vector subspace of TxM such that TxM = TxF ⊕ TxF ⊥.
The collection of these vector subspaces form a distribution on M that we will
denote as T F ⊥.

On the other hand, the tangent bundle to the foliation F is a trivial vector bundle
isomorphic to M × g under the isomorphism M × g → T F , given by (x, X) 7→ X ∗
x.
That also deﬁnes an isomorphism ﬁber of TxF with g. For the rest of the paper,
for an element X in the Lie algebra of a group acting on a manifold, we denote by
X ∗ the vector ﬁeld on the manifold whose one-parameter group of diﬀeomorphism
is given by (exp(tX))t through the action on the manifold.

The space of Killing ﬁelds of a geometric structure ω in a manifold M is denoted
by Kill(M, ω), and Kill0(M, ω, x) will denote the subspace of Kill(M, ω) consisting
of vector ﬁelds that vanish on x. Here, we denote by σ the geometric structure
of the pseudo-Riemannian metric on M . Unless otherwise is indicated, we will
also omit the symbol that denotes the structure of pseudo-Riemannian metric, in
particular, Kill(M ) := Kill(M, σ).

Let V be a vector space, we denote by so(V ) the Lie algebra of linear maps on V
that are skew-symmetric with respect to a non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form
on V .

As an immediate use of the previous deﬁnition and as consequence of the Jacobi

identity we have the next lemma, showed in [7].

Lemma 2.1. Let N be a pseudo-Riemannian manifold and n ∈ N . Then, the map
λn : Kill0(N, n) → so(TnN ) given by λn(Z)(w) = [Z, W ]n, where W is any vector
ﬁeld such that Wn = w, is a well deﬁned homomorphism of Lie algebras.

Here, the universal covering of any manifold N it will be denoted as eN . Next,

we present a result, proved in [10], which is fundamental in the present work.

Proposition 2.2 ([10, Proposition 2.3]). Let G be a connected non-compact simple
Lie group acting isometrically and with a dense orbit on a connected ﬁnite volume

action on M . Assume that M and the G-action on M are both analytic. Then,

its image ρx(g) = g(x).

1. There is a homomorphism ρx : g → Kill(fM ) which is an isomorphism onto
2. g(x) ⊂ Kill0(fM , x), i.e. every element of g(x) vanishes at x.

3. For every X, Y ∈ g we have

[ρx(X), Y ∗] = [X, Y ]∗ = −[X ∗, Y ∗].

In particular, the elements in g(x) and their corresponding local ﬂows pre-
serve both F and T F ⊥.

submodules.

4. The homomorphism of Lie algebras λx ◦ ρx : g → so(TxfM ) induces a
g-module structure on TxfM for which subspaces TxF and TxF ⊥ are g-
We consider the g-valued 1-form θ on fM which is deﬁned, at every x ∈ fM , using
the composition of the projection TxfM → TxF and the isomorphism of TxF with

g. We also consider the g-valued 2-form given by Θ = dθ|∧2T F ⊥.
The proof of the following result can be found in [10, p. 239].

Lemma 2.3. Let G, M and S be as in Proposition 2.2. If we assume that the
G-orbits are non-degenerate, then:

(1) For every x ∈ S, the maps θx : TxfM → g and Θx : ∧2TxF ⊥ → g are both

homomorphism of g-modules, for the g-module structures from Proposition
2.2.

(2) The normal bundle T F ⊥ is integrable if and only if Θ = 0.

Remark 2.4. Let G, M and S be as in Proposition 2.2, suppose that the G-orbits
on M are non-degenerate. From the precedent Lemma and the analyticity of the
elements involved in this work we have two possible cases: (i) Θ ≡ 0 and then T F ⊥

In what it follows we will assume that the G-orbits are non-degenerate with

respect to the pseudo-Riemannian metric. Hence, the eG-orbits on fM are non-
degenerate as well and we have a direct sum decomposition T fM = T F ⊕ T F ⊥ .

The non-degeneracy of the orbits is ensured for manifolds of low dimension with
respect to the dimension of the Lie group acting on this, that is the result of the
following Lemma that can be founded in [10].

Lemma 2.5 ([10, Lemma 2.7]). Let G be a connected non-compact simple Lie group
acting isometrically and with a dense orbit on a connected ﬁnite volume pseudo-
Riemannian manifold M . If dim(M ) < 2 dim(G), then the bundles T F and T F ⊥
have ﬁbers that are non-degenerated with respect to the metric on M .

obtained by lifting the G-action on M . Let us denote by H the Lie subalgebra of

For the G-action as in Proposition 2.2, we consider fM endowed with the eG-action
Kill(fM ) consisting of the ﬁelds that centralize the eG-action on fM . Our ﬁrst lemma

involving H is about an embedding of the Lie algebra g into H. Such result allows
us to apply representation theory to the study of H.

Lemma 2.6 ([7, Lemma 1.7]). Let S as in Proposition 2.2. Then, for every x ∈ S

and for ρx given as in Proposition 2.2, the map bρx : H → Kill(fM ) deﬁned as:

bρx(X) = ρx(X) + X ∗,

RIGIDITY OF AN ISOMETRIC SL(3, R)-ACTION

is an injective homomorphism of Lie algebras whose image G(x) lies in H.

In

particular, bρx induces on H a g-module structure such that G(x) is a submodule

isomorphic to g.

Proof. First, observe that by the identity in Proposition 2.2(3), one can see that

the image of bρx lies in H.
To prove that bρx is a homomorphism of Lie algebras we apply Proposition 2.2

as follows: for X, Y ∈ g we have

[bρx(X),bρx(Y )] = [ρx(X) + X ∗, ρx(Y ) + Y ∗]

= [ρx(X), ρx(Y )] + [X, Y ]∗ + [X, Y ]∗ + [X ∗, Y ∗]
= ρx([X, Y ]) + [x, Y ]∗

= bρx([X, Y ]).

From the deﬁnition of bρx we observe that bρx(X) = 0 implies that X ∗ = 0, which

in turns yields X = 0, because the G-action is locally free. Therefore, the last claim
of our lemma is now clear.
(cid:3)

The following lemma relates the structure of g-module of H to that of TxfM .
Lemma 2.7. Let S as in Proposition 2.2. Consider TxfM and H endowed with the

g-module structure given by Proposition 2.2(4) and Lemma 2.6, respectively. Then,
for almost every x ∈ S, the evaluation map:

Z 7→ Zx

is a homomorphism of g-modules that satisﬁes evx(G(x)) = TxF . Furthermore, for

evx : H → TxfM ,
almost every x ∈ S we have evx(H) = TxfM .
evx(X · Z) = [bρx(X), Z]x = [ρx(X) + X ∗, Z]x = [ρx(X), Z]x = X · Zx = X · evx(Z)

Proof. For every x ∈ S, if we let Z ∈ H and X ∈ g be given, then:

where we have used Lemma 2.1 and the deﬁnition of the g-module structures in-
volved, thus proving the ﬁrst part. The second part is proved by Lemma 4.1 in
[13], using the transitivity of h on an open dense conull set in M .
(cid:3)

The next lemma shows the existence of a relation between isometries and Killing
ﬁelds for complete manifolds. It also shows that every Lie algebra containing Killing
vector ﬁelds can be obtained from an isometric right action, and whose proof can
be found in [7].

Lemma 2.8. Let N be a complete pseudo-Riemannian manifold and H a simply
connected Lie group with Lie algebra h. If ψ : h → Kill(N ) is a homomorphism of
Lie algebras, then there exists an isometric right H-action, N × H → N , such that
ψ(X) = X ∗, for every X ∈ h. Furthermore, if N is analytic, then the H-action is
analytic as well.

3. Analysis and properties of isometric SL(3, R)actions

In this section we assume that G = SL(3, R), which is a connected, non-compact
simple Lie group, that the dimension of M satisﬁes that 8 < dim(M ) ≤ 14 and
we remain the other hypotheses of Proposition 2.2. Hence, g = sl(3, R) and, from
Lemma 2.5, we have that the orbits of the action on the manifold M are non-
degenerated.

With our hypotheses in the previous paragraph we have the following result.

8

RA ´UL QUIROGA-BARRANCO AND ELI ROBLERO-M ´ENDEZ

Theorem 3.1. With the hypotheses in Theorem A, if we assume that our normal

bundle T F ⊥ is integrable then fM ∼= fSL(3, R) × eN , where eN is a complete pseudo-

Riemannian manifold.

Proof. This is a direct consequence of the main results in [10].

(cid:3)

The previous theorem induces to analyze the case when the normal bundle T F ⊥
is not integrable. Hence, from now on we assume that the normal bundle to the
foliation is not integrable.

Using the analyticity of our hypotheses we have the following result.

Lemma 3.2. Let S as in Proposition 2.2. Let x ∈ S be, consider TxF ⊥ endowed
with the sl(3, R)-module structure given by Proposition 2.2(4). Then, for almost
every x ∈ S, TxF ⊥ is isomorphic to R3 ⊕ R3∗ and dim(M ) = 14. In particular, the
algebra so(TxF ⊥) is isomorphic to so(3, 3) as a Lie algebra and as a sl(3, R)-module.

Proof. By the non-integrability of T F ⊥ then, from Lemma 2.3(2), we have that the
2-form Θ is not equal to zero. Since this 2-form is analytic, then it vanishes on a
proper analytic subset of null measure. Hence, Θx 6= 0 for almost every x ∈ S.

Choose and ﬁx an element x ∈ S such that Θx 6= 0. By the deﬁnition of Θx
we have that TxF ⊥ is a non-trivial sl(3, R)-module preserving a non-degenerate
symmetric bilinear form with 1 < dim(TxF ⊥) ≤ 6, then from Lemma 1.1 and
Proposition 2.2(4), TxF ⊥ ≃ R3 ⊕ R3∗ as a sl(3, R)-module. Hence, dim(TxF ⊥) = 6
and, therefore, dim(M ) = 14.

On the other hand, by Lemma 1.1, the representation of sl(3, R) on TxF ⊥ deﬁnes
a non-trivial homomorphism of Lie algebras so(TxF ⊥) → so(3, 3), which is also an
isomorphism of sl(3, R)-modules. Since so(3, 3) is a simple Lie algebra, this latter
homomorphism is injective and so is an isomorphism.
(cid:3)

The results of the previous lemma allow us to obtain a decomposition of the cen-

tralizer H of the fSL(3, R)-action into submodules related to the pseudo-Riemannian
metric structure on fM . First, recall that Lemma 2.6 induces on H a structure of

sl(3, R)-module.

Lemma 3.3. Let S be as in Proposition 2.2. Then, for almost every x ∈ S there is a
decomposition of H into sl(3, R)-submodules, H = G(x) ⊕ H0(x) ⊕ W(x), satisfying:

1) G(x) = bρx(sl(3, R)) is a Lie subalgebra of H isomorphic to sl(3, R) and

evx(G(x)) = TxF .

2) H0(x) = ker(evx) is a Lie subalgebra and a sl(3, R)-module of H, isomor-

phic to a subset of so(TxF ⊥).

3) W(x) is isomorphic to R3⊕R3∗ as sl(3, R)-module and evx(W(x)) = TxF ⊥.
In particular, the evaluation map (at x) deﬁnes an isomorphism of sl(3, R)-modules
G(x) ⊕ W(x) → TxF ⊕ TxF ⊥, preserving the summands in that order. In 2), we
have that the considered isomorphism is as a Lie algebra and as an sl(3, R)-module.

Proof. Let us choose and ﬁx an element x ∈ S that satisﬁes Lemma 2.7 and Lemma

to sl(3, R).

3.2. By Lemma 2.6 we conclude that G(x) = bρx(sl(3, R)) is a Lie algebra isomorphic
submodule of H. On the other hand, since H0(x) = H ∩ Kill0(fM , x), one can see

Deﬁne H0(x) = ker(evx). By Lemma 2.7, it follows that H0(x) is an sl(3, R)-

that H0(x) is a Lie subalgebra of H.

Since the elements of G(x) are of the form ρx(X)+X ∗, with X ∈ sl(3, R). Hence,
for any such element we have evx(ρx(X) + X ∗) = X ∗
x. That and the condition
evx(ρx(X)+X ∗) = 0 imply that X = 0. In other words, G(x)∩H0(x) = 0; therefore
there exists an sl(3, R)-submodule complementary W ′(x) to G(x) ⊕ H0(x) in H.

λ⊥

leaves invariant the normal bundle. On the other hand, the map λx restricted to

We choose W(x) as the inverse image of TxF ⊥ under our previous isomorphism.
We have our desired decomposition of H into sl(3, R)-submodules.

Note, we have an isomorphism from G(x)⊕W ′(x) onto TxfM via the evaluation map.
Let Kill0(fM , x, F ) be the Lie algebra of Killing vector ﬁelds on fM which preserves
the foliation F and vanish at x. Note that every vector ﬁeld in Kill0(fM , x, F )
Kill0(fM , x, F ) induces the following homomorphism of Lie algebras:
Observe that both ρx(sl(3, R)) and H0(x) lie inside of Kill0(fM , x, F ).

x is injective when is restricted to sl(3, R)(x). By our choice of the
x ◦ρx : sl(3, R) → so(TxF ⊥)
element x ∈ S and the results in Lemma 3.2, the map λ⊥
is a non-trivial homomorphism of Lie algebras. Since sl(3, R) is a simple Lie algebra
then the map λ⊥
Claim 2: λ⊥

x restricted to sl(3, R) is injective.
x restricted to H0(x) is injective. Recall that pseudo-Riemannian
metric structures are 1-rigid structures (see [2]), therefore a Killing vector space is
completely determined by its 1-jet at x. If Z ∈ H0(x) is given, then Zx = evx(Z) =
0; so it is determined by the values [Z, V ]x, for V vector ﬁeld on a neighborhood

x : Kill0(fM , x, F ) → so(TxF ⊥),

X 7→ λx(X)|TxF ⊥.

Claim 1: λ⊥

of x. Since Z is in the centralizer of the fSL(3, R)-action, then [Z, X ∗]x = 0 for

all X ∈ sl(3, R), so [Z, V ]x = 0 when Vx ∈ TxF . Hence, if [Z, V ]x = 0 when
Vx ∈ TxF ⊥, this implies that Z = 0. Therefore, we have that λ⊥
x is injective when
it is restricted to H0(x).

On the other hand, if X ∈ sl(3, R) and Y ∈ H0(x) then

λ⊥
x (X · Y ) = λ⊥
= λ⊥
= X · λ⊥

x (Y ).

x ([bρx(X), Y ]) = λ⊥

x ([ρx(X), Y ]) = [λ⊥

x ([ρx(X) + X ∗, Y ])
x (ρx(X)), λ⊥
x (Y )]

That shows that the map λ⊥
modules.

x restricted to H0(x) is a homomorphism of sl(3, R)-
(cid:3)

Remark 3.4. By Lemma 3.3 we have that H0(x) is a subalgebra, and an sl(3, R)-
submodule, isomorphic to λ⊥
so(T ⊥
to one of the Lie subalgebras in Corollary 1.3.

x(cid:0)H0(x)(cid:1) ⊂ so(TxF ⊥). On the other hand, since

x ) is isomorphic to so(3, 3) (and hence to sl(4, R)), then H0(x) is isomorphic

By Lemma A.5 in [8], we have that ∧2TxF ⊥ is isomorphic to so(TxF ⊥) as
so(TxF ⊥)-module. Thus, from the deﬁnition of the map Θx in Lemma 2.3 and
Lemma A.5 in [8], we can consider Θx as a map from so(TxF ⊥) to sl(3, R).

More properties about the subalgebra H0(x) can be obtained considering the
map Θx as in the previous paragraph, one of these is contained in the following
result which appears in Proposition 3.10 and Proposition 3.11 in [8].
Theorem 3.5. For almost every x ∈ S as in Lemma 3.3. λ⊥

Proof. Let x ∈ S be an element satisfying Lemma 3.3, so it does Lemma 2.7 and
Lemma 3.2.

The element x ∈ S has the required properties of the hypotheses of Proposition
3.10 in [8]. Therefore, the proof of this theorem is similar to that of the above
mentioned proposition.
(cid:3)

Remark 3.6. Decomposing so(TxF ⊥) (isomorphic to so(3, 3)) as a direct sum of
irreducible sl(3, R)-submodules, and its corresponding bracket product, Lemma 1.2
yields that the only possibilities for H0(x) satisfying Theorem 3.5 are 0, or isomor-
phic to R.

4. Structure of the Centralizer and its consequences

The previous section was devoted to show all the possible values that H0(x) can
take. This section we analyze the implications of all these possible cases. Here, we
assume the same hypotheses and notation of Lemma 3.3.

First, ﬁxed an arbitrarily element x ∈ S as in Lemma 3.3 and Theorem 3.5,
guaranty (by Lemma 3.2 and Lemma 3.3) we can choose subspaces V(x) and V ∗(x)
of W(x) such that W(x) = V(x) ⊕ V ∗(x) and G(x) acts on V(x) (resp. V ∗(x)) as
sl(3, R) acts on R3 (resp. R3∗).

Thus, H is an sl(3, R)-module and on properties of the evaluation map in Lemma

3.3, we have the following properties:

(4.1)

(4.2)

(4.3)

(4.4)

[G(x), H0(x)] ⊆ H0(x)
[G(x), W(x)] = W(x)

[H0(x), W(x)] ⊆ H0(x) ⊕ W(x)
[H0(x), H0(x)] ⊆ H0(x)

In particular, when H0(x) is isomorphic to R or to 0, the contention (4.3) is

strict. That is a consequence of the following lemma.

Lemma 4.1. As in Lemma 3.3, if H0(x) is isomorphic either to R, sl(3, R),
sl(3, R) ⊕ R or sl(4, R) then [H0(x), W(x)] = W(x).

Next, we analyze the diﬀerent possibilities of H0(x) satisfying Theorem 3.5.

Recall that H0(x) is isomorphic to one of the subalgebras of Remark 3.6.

4.0.1. H0(x) = 0.

Lemma 4.2. Let S be as in Lemma 3.3. If x ∈ S and H0(x) = 0 then, one of the
following occurs:

(1) The Radical of H is W(x) = V(x) ⊕ V ∗(x).
(2) H = G(x) ⊕ V(x) ⊕ V ∗(x) is isomorphic to g2(2).

Proof. Let us choose an arbitrary but ﬁxed element x ∈ S such that H0(x) = 0, as
in Lemma 3.3. Hence, H = G(x) ⊕ W(x) = G(x) ⊕ V(x) ⊕ V ∗(x).

Since G(x) is a simple Lie algebra, we can choose s a Levi factor of H which
contains G(x). Since G(x) ⊆ s and considering the structure of H as an sl(3, R)-
module, then s is also an sl(3, R)-module.

Let W be an sl(3, R)-module of H such that s = G(x) ⊕ W . Moreover, since
rad(H) is an ideal of H this induces the decomposition of H as a direct sum of
sl(3, R)-modules:

H = s ⊕ rad(H) = G(x) ⊕ W ⊕ rad(H)

RIGIDITY OF AN ISOMETRIC SL(3, R)-ACTION

that we compare with its decomposition into irreducible sl(3, R)-submodules from
Lemma 3.3

H = G(x) ⊕ V(x) ⊕ V ∗(x).

The properties of representations of Lie algebras and the decompositions of H

imply that one of the following must occur:

(a) s = G(x) ⊕ V(x) and rad(H) = V ∗(x).
(b) s = G(x) ⊕ V ∗(x) and rad(H) = V(x).
(c) s = G(x) and rad(H) = V(x) ⊕ V ∗(x).
(d) H = G(x) ⊕ V(x) ⊕ V ∗(x) is semisimple.

Suppose the case (a) is satisﬁed:

s = G(x) ⊕ V(x)

and rad(H) = V ∗(x).

Because s = G(x) ⊕ V(x) is a semisimple Lie algebra, then s is a ﬁnite direct
product, of simple ideals h1 × h2 × · · · × hk. Since, every ideal is invariant by G(x)
then these ideals are sl(3, R)-modules. Representation properties of sl(3, R) and the
decomposition of s in a direct sum of irreducible sl(3, R)-modules yield that k ≤ 2.
If k = 2, s = h1 × h2. By (4.2) we have that [G(x), V(x)] ⊆ V(x). Additionally,
since V(x) is isomorphic to R3 as sl(3, R)-module then, [V(x), V(x)] 6= 0 implies
that [V(x), V(x)] ≃ R3∗
. Which shows that [V(x), V(x)] = 0. Therefore V(x) is an
ideal of s = G(x) ⊕ V(x). Without loss of generality, we assume h2 = V(x), then
the simple ideal h2 must be an abelian ideal, thus k = 1.

However, if k = 1, s is a simple Lie algebra. Thence, s = G(x) ⊕ V(x) is a 11-
dimensional real simple Lie algebra. Therefore, sC is a complex simple Lie algebra
with complex dimension 11 and [4, p. 516], showed it cannot happen. Then, we
have proved that case (a) cannot happen.

Assume case (b) is satisﬁed:

s = G(x) ⊕ V ∗(x)

and rad(H) = V(x).

This case is ruled out by a similar argument of case (a).
Suppose case (c) is satisﬁed:

s = G(x)

and rad(H) = V(x) ⊕ V ∗(x).

Since V(x) ≃ R3 and V ∗(x) ≃ R3∗ as sl(3, R)-modules then by properties of
representation of sl(3, R) we have that [V(x), V ∗(x)] is isomorphic to a subspace of
sl(3, R) ⊕ R as a sl(3, R)-module. Therefore, we have that [V(x), V(x)] ⊆ V ∗(x),
[V(x), V ∗(x)] = 0 and [V ∗(x), V ∗(x)] ⊆ V(x). And by the solvability of rad(H) we
have that [V(x), V(x)] = 0 or [V ∗(x), V ∗(x)] = 0.

If case (d) is satisﬁed:

H = G(x) ⊕ V(x) ⊕ V ∗(x)

is a simple Lie algebra.

Using the same argument as in case (a), H is a direct product of a ﬁnite number
of simple ideals h1 × h2 × · · · × hk where every ideal is an sl(3, R)-module and k ≤ 3.
If k = 3, H = h1×h2×h3, we can assume, reindexing if necessary, that h3 = V ∗(x)
and h1 × h2 = G(x) ⊕ V(x). Then [V ∗(x), V ∗(x)] ⊆ h3, but similar to case (a) we
have that [V ∗(x), V ∗(x)] = 0, so h3 is an abelian Lie algebra and this is not possible.
Therefore k ≤ 2.

12

If k = 2, H = h1 × h2, after decomposing h1 and h2 as the direct sum of
sl(3, R)-modules, and reindexing if necessary, we can assume that h1 is an irre-
ducible sl(3, R)-module and h2 = V1 ⊕ V2, where V1 and V2 are irreducible sl(3, R)-
modules. We can also assume that V ∗(x) ⊂ h2 and V(x) ⊕ V ∗(x) = h2, because
as in the previous case, it cannot happen that h1 = V(x). Then G(x) ⊆ h1 and
[G(x), W(x)] = [h1, h2] = 0 that contradicts the equation (4.2).

If k = 1, H = G(x) ⊕ V(x) ⊕ V ∗(x) is a real simple Lie algebra of dimension 14.
Then, H is the realiﬁcation of a complex simple Lie algebra of dimension 7 or its
complexiﬁcation, HC, is a complex simple Lie algebra. Since, by [4, p. 516], there
is not a complex simple Lie algebra of dimension 7. So, HC is a complex simple
Lie algebra with dimC(HC) = 14. Then, HC ∼= g2. From here, H is isomorphic to
a real form of g2.

On the other hand, we recall that H contains a Lie subalgebra isomorphic to
sl(3, R), that is simple and non-compact. Then, H is non-compact. Otherwise,
exercise 4(ii) in the page 152 of [4], would imply that sl(3, R) is compact, which is
a contradiction.

Since, by [4, p. 518], there is only a non-compact real form of g2, namely g2(2).

Then

4.0.2. H0(x) ≃ R.

H = G(x) ⊕ V(x) ⊕ V ∗(x) ≃ g2(2).

(cid:3)

Lemma 4.3. Let S be as in Lemma 3.3. Let x ∈ S be such that H0(x) is isomorphic
to R as an sl(3, R)-module then one of the following occurs

(1) The radical of H is H0(x) ⊕ V(x) ⊕ V ∗(x) where V(x) ⊕ V ∗(x) is a Lie

subalgebra.

(2) H = G(x) ⊕ H0(x) ⊕ V(x) ⊕ V ∗(x) is a simple Lie algebra isomorphic to

sl(4, R).

Proof. Let us choose an arbitrary but ﬁxed element x ∈ S, as in Lemma 3.3, such
that H0(x) ≃ R.

Choose s a Levi factor of H that contains G(x). Similar to the case H0(x) = 0,

s is a sl(3, R)-submodule of H.

Let W be a sl(3, R)-submodule of H such that s = G(x) ⊕ W . Since rad(H) is an
ideal, this induces the next decomposition of H as a direct sum of sl(3, R)-modules:

H = G(x) ⊕ W ⊕ rad(H)

that we compare with the decomposition of irreducible sl(3, R)-modules in Lemma
3.3

H = G(x) ⊕ H0(x) ⊕ V(x) ⊕ V ∗(x).

By the properties of representations of Lie algebras and the decomposition of

H = G(x) ⊕ H0(x) ⊕ V(x) ⊕ V ∗(x), one of the following must occur:

(a) s = G(x) ⊕ H0(x) ⊕ V(x) and rad(H) = V ∗(x).
(b) s = G(x) ⊕ H0(x) ⊕ V ∗(x) and rad(H) = V(x).
(c) s = G(x) ⊕ V(x) ⊕ V ∗(x) and rad(H) = H0(x).
(d) s = G(x) ⊕ H0(x) and rad(H) = V(x) ⊕ V ∗(x).
(e) s = G(x) ⊕ V(x) and rad(H) = H0(x) ⊕ V ∗(x).
(f) s = G(x) ⊕ V ∗(x) and rad(H) = H0(x) ⊕ V(x).
(g) s = G(x) and rad(H) = H0(x) ⊕ V(x) ⊕ V ∗(x).

RIGIDITY OF AN ISOMETRIC SL(3, R)-ACTION

13

(h) H = G(x) ⊕ H0(x) ⊕ V(x) ⊕ V ∗(x) is semisimple.
Suppose that case (a) is satisﬁed:

s = G(x) ⊕ H0(x) ⊕ V(x) and rad(H) = V ∗(x).

Recall that s = G(x) ⊕ H0(x) ⊕ V(x) is a semisimple Lie algebra.
Since V(x) ≃ R3 and [V(x), V(x)] ⊆ s. If [V(x), V(x)] 6= 0 then [V(x), V(x)] is
isomorphic to R3∗. Therefore, the projection of [V(x), V(x)] in G(x), H0(x) and
V(x) is 0. That implies that [V(x), V(x)] = 0. Hence, V(x) is an abelian ideal of s,
which is a contradiction. So, case (a) cannot be possible.

Case (b) is not possible and the proof is similar to (a).
Now suppose case (c) is satisﬁed:
s = G(x) ⊕ V(x) ⊕ V ∗(x)

and rad(H) = H0(x).

Here, by Lemma 4.1, we have that [H0(x), V(x) ⊕ V ∗(x)] = V(x) ⊕ V ∗(x). On
the other hand, since rad(H) is an ideal of H, then V(x) ⊕ V ∗(x) ⊆ rad(H). So,
this case cannot occur.

Suppose case (d) is satisﬁed:

s = G(x) ⊕ H0(x)

and rad(H) = V(x) ⊕ V ∗(x).

From (4.1) and (4.4), we have that H0(x) is an abelian ideal of s. Which is a

contradiction. Then case (d) is not possible.

Suppose, the case (e) is satisﬁed:

s = G(x) ⊕ V(x)

and rad(H) = H0(x) ⊕ V ∗(x).

Similar to the argument in case (a), V(x) is an abelian ideal of s. Therefore, this

case is not possible.

Case (f ),

s = G(x) ⊕ V ∗(x)

and rad(H) = H0(x) ⊕ V(x),

cannot happen and the proof is similar to that of (e).

Now, we suppose (g) is satisﬁed:

s = G(x)

and rad(H) = H0(x) ⊕ V(x) ⊕ V ∗(x).

By Lemma 4.1 we have [H0(x), W(x)] = W(x). Let π0 : rad(H) → H0(x) be
the projection map on the ﬁrst component of rad(H), since [W(x), W(x)] ⊆ rad(H)
then π0([W(x), W(x)]) = 0. Otherwise rad(H) will not be solvable. In conclusion,
V(x) ⊕ V ∗(x) is a Lie subalgebra of rad(H).

If case (h) is satisﬁed:

H = G(x) ⊕ H0(x) ⊕ V(x) ⊕ V ∗(x)

is semisimple.

Here, H is a ﬁnite direct product h1 × h2 × · · · × hk of simple ideals which also

are sl(3, R)-modules with k ≤ 4.

If k = 4, H = h1 × h2 × h3 × h4. Without loss of generality we can assume
that h4 = H0(x) is a simple ideal of H. Since H0(x) ≃ R is abelian, this is a
contradiction. Therefore k = 4 cannot be possible and k ≤ 3.

If k = 3, H = h1 × h2 × h3. Suppose, reindexing if necessary, that h1 and h2
are irreducible sl(3, R)-modules and h3 = V1 ⊕ V2, where V1 and V2 are irreducibles
sl(3, R)-modules. We can also assume that H0(x) ⊂ h3 then, by Lemma 4.1, V(x)⊕
V ∗(x) ⊂ h3. That implies that h1 or h2 is equal to 0. Therefore, this case is not
possible and k ≤ 2.

14

RA ´UL QUIROGA-BARRANCO AND ELI ROBLERO-M ´ENDEZ

If k = 2, H = h1 × h2. As in case k = 3, assume H0(x) ⊕ W(x) ⊂ h2. On the
other hand, by (4.2), [G(x), W(x)] = W(x) then G(x) ⊂ h2 and h1 = 0, which is a
contradiction. Hence, this case cannot be possible and k = 1.

If k = 1, H is a real simple Lie algebra of dimension 15. Therefore, HC is a
complex simple Lie algebra with dimC(HC) = 15. Then, by [4, p. 516], HC ≃
sl(4, C). So, H is isomorphic to a non-compact real form of sl(4, C).

From [4, Table V], the only non-compact real forms of sl(4, C) are su(1, 3),

su(2, 2), su∗(4) and sl(4, R).

Then, H is isomorphic to one of the previous Lie algebras. Recall that H contains
a simple Lie subalgebra isomorphic to sl(3, R). From here 2 = rankR(sl(3, R)) ≤
rankR(H). By [4, Table V], we have rankR(su(1, 3)) = rankR(su∗(4)) = 1. Then, H
cannot be isomorphic to either su(1, 3) or su∗(4). On the other hand, page 519 of [4]
shows that su(2, 2) ≃ so(4, 2). So, if H ≃ su(2, 2) then sl(3, R) is isomorphic to a Lie
subalgebra of so(4, 2). In this case sl(3, R) would have a non-trivial representation
on a 6-dimensional vector space that preserves a non-degenerate symmetric bilinear
form of signature (4, 2). By Lemma 1.1 this cannot be possible. Thus, H ≃ su(2, 2)
is not possible. Then H ≃ sl(4, R).
(cid:3)

5. Proof of the Main Theorem

In this section we assume M is a connected analytic pseudo-Riemannian man-
ifold with dim(M ) = 14 and ﬁnite volume. We also assume that SL(3, R) acts
isometric and analytically on M with a dense orbit, therefore the action is locally
free, such that the normal bundle to the foliation (obtained by the action) T F ⊥ is
not integrable. We study the structure of the manifold M through the analysis of
the diﬀerent possibilities of H obtained in Section 4. As in the previous section, we
use the notation of Lemma 3.3.

Let x ∈ fM be an element that satisﬁes Lemma 3.3 and Theorem 3.5. By Lemma

4.2 and Lemma 4.3 we can reduce the structure of H to only 2 options: (1) W(x) ⊆
rad(H) is a subalgebra or (2) H is a simple Lie algebra. In this section we analyze
these cases and, assuming that T F ⊥ is not integrable then, we will see that we can
eliminate the ﬁrst possibility.

5.1. W(x) ⊆ rad(H) is a subalgebra. Here, we assume that W(x) is a subalgebra

of rad(H) for some x ∈ fM .

Since rad(H) is a solvable Lie algebra then, as case (c) in Lemma 4.2 and case
(g) in 4.3, W(x) = V(x) ⊕ V ∗(x) is a 2-step nilpotent or an abelian Lie subalgebra.
By Lemma 3.3 and since W(x) is a subalgebra, we have that G(x) ⊕ W(x) is
a Lie subalgebra of H. Thus, G(x) ⊕ W(x) is isomorphic, as Lie algebra, to the
semidirect product sl(3, R) ⋉ w, where w is an sl(3, R)-module, 2-step nilpotent or
abelian Lie algebra isomorphic to W(x). Choose an isomorphism of Lie algebras
ψ : sl(3, R) ⋉ w → H(x) that maps sl(3, R) onto G(x) and w onto W(x).

sl(3, R) ⋉ w, where the group structure on W is induced considering the action of
sl(3, R) on w. By Lemma 2.8, there exists an analytic isometric right action of

Let fSL(3, R) ⋉W be a simply connected Lie group such that Lie(fSL(3, R) ⋉W) =
fSL(3, R) ⋉ W on fM such that ψ(X) = X ∗ for every X ∈ sl(3, R) ⋉ w.
Since H centralizes the left fSL(3, R)-action, then the right (cid:0)fSL(3, R) ⋉W(cid:1)-action
centralizes the left fSL(3, R)-action as well and preserves both T F and T F ⊥.

RIGIDITY OF AN ISOMETRIC SL(3, R)-ACTION

15

Using the right (cid:0)fSL(3, R) ⋉ W(cid:1)-action on fM , we consider the following map:

(5.1)

p : fSL(3, R) ⋉ W → fM ,

h 7→ x · h,

for h ∈ fSL(3, R) ⋉ W. This action is (cid:0)fSL(3, R) ⋉ W(cid:1)-equivariant by the right action
on its domain. If e and 0 denote the identity element in the subgroups fSL(3, R)

and W, respectively, then

(5.2)

dp(e,0) :

sl(3, R) ⋉ w → G(x) ⊕ W(x) → TxfM

X 7→ X ∗ 7→ X ∗
x.

Since ψ(X) = X ∗ for all X ∈ sl(3, R) ⋉ w, by Lemma 3.3, dp(e,0) maps sl(3, R) onto
TxF and w onto TxF ⊥. Therefore, p is a local diﬀeomorphism at (e, 0).

For every w ∈ W, let Rw denote the map on fSL(3, R) ⋉ W and on fM given by
the correspondence y 7→ y · (e, w). Since W is a subgroup of fSL(3, R) ⋉ W we have
Let P = p(e × W), which deﬁnes a submanifold of fM in a neighborhood of

x = p(e, 0). Here, by the previous remarks, we have that

that Rw(W) = W.

Tp(e,0)P = dp(e,0)(T(e,0)(e × W)) = Tp(e,0)F ⊥,

which with the equivariance of p implies that

Tp(e,w)P = dp(e,w)(T(e,w)(e × W)) = dp(e,w)(d(Rw)(e,0)(T(e,0)(e × W)))

= d(Rw ◦ p)(e,0)(T(e,0)(e × W)) = d(Rw)p(e,0)(Tp(e,0)P )
= d(Rw)p(e,0)Tp(e,0)F ⊥ = TRw(p(e,0))F ⊥ = Tp(e,w)F ⊥,

we have used in the previous identities that Rw preserves the bundle T F ⊥. This
proves that P is an integral submanifold of T F ⊥ passing through the element
x = p(e, 0).

By the left fSL(3, R)-action on fM we obtain by restriction to P the following

map:

φ : fSL(3, R) × P → fM ,

(g, y) 7→ g · y,

whose diﬀerential at (e, x) is given by: X + v 7→ X ∗
x + v, with X ∈ sl(3, R) and
v ∈ TxP . This shows that the diﬀerential at (e, x) is an isomorphism and therefore
the map φ is a diﬀeomorphism from a neighborhood of (e, x) onto a neighborhood of

x. Since the left fSL(3, R)-action preserves both T F and T F ⊥, there is an integral
submanifold of T F ⊥ passing through every point in a neighborhood of x in fM .
Lemma 2.3 implies the integrability of T F ⊥ everywhere in fM .

Thus, the tensor Θ considered in Lemma 2.3 vanishes in a neighborhood of x. Since
all of our objects are analytic, this implies that Θ vanishes everywhere therefore

This last conclusion contradicts the assumption about the integrability of T F ⊥.

5.2. H is a simple Lie algebra. Here, we assume H(x) is a simple Lie algebra.
By Lemma 4.2 and Lemma 4.3 we have two possibilities: (a) H0(x) = 0 and
H(x) ≃ g2(2) or (b) H0(x) ≃ R and H(x) ≃ sl(4, R)

5.2.1. H ≃ g2(2). If H0(x) = 0 and H is a simple Lie algebra then we have proved
that H ≃ g2(2), therefore our the following result:

Lemma 5.1. There is an isomorphism

ψ : g2(2) = sl(3, R) ⊕ R3 ⊕ R3∗ → G(x) ⊕ V(x) ⊕ V ∗ = H

of Lie algebras. In particular, we have that ψ is an isomorphism of sl(3, R)-modules
which preserves the summands in that order.

Proof. Let ψ : g2(2) → H be an isomorphism of simple Lie algebras. Thus,
ψ−1(G(x)) is a Lie subalgebra which provides a direct sum decomposition of g2(2)
into irreducible sl(3, R)-modules. Such decomposition, by [3, Chapter 22], is given
by ψ−1(G(x)) ⊕ R3 ⊕ R3∗. Therefore,

ψ(ψ−1(G(x))) ⊕ ψ(R3) ⊕ ψ(R3∗) = G(x) ⊕ ψ(R3) ⊕ ψ(R3∗),

is a decomposition of H into irreducible sl(3, R)-modules.

Recall that we have a previous decomposition of H into irreducible sl(3, R)-

modules

H = G(x) ⊕ V(x) ⊕ V ∗(x).

Comparing the two decomposition of H into irreducible sl(3, R)-modules we obtain
our desired result.
(cid:3)

We ﬁx an isomorphism of Lie algebras ψ : g2(2) → H as in the previous lemma.
Let G2(2) denote a simply connected Lie group such that Lie(G2(2)) = g2(2). By

Lemma 2.8, there exists an analytic isometric right G2(2)-action on fM such that

ψ(X) = X ∗, for all X ∈ g2(2). Now, we consider the map:

p : G2(2) → fM

7→ x · g,

g

that satisﬁes dpe(X) = X ∗
x = ψ(X) for every X ∈ g2(2). Thus, by our choice of ψ
and Lemma 3.3, dpe is an isomorphism that maps sl(3, R) on TxF and R3 ⊕ R3∗
onto TxF ⊥. Since p is G2(2)-equivariant for the right action on its domain, then we
have a local diﬀeomorphism.

Lemma 5.2. Let ¯g be the metric on g2(2) deﬁned as the pullback under dpe of the

metric gx on TxfM then ¯g is sl(3, R)-invariant.

Proof. By properties of dpe and the isomorphism ψ, we need only to prove that
the metric on H deﬁned as the pullback of gx by the evaluation map, X 7→ Xx, is
G(x)-equivariant.

Let ˜g be the metric on H obtained of this way. Let X, Y, Z ∈ H be given with
X ∈ G(x). By Lemma 2.7 there exists X0 ∈ sl(3, R) such that X = ρx(X0) + X ∗
0 ,
where ρx is the homomorphism in Proposition 2.2 and X ∗

induced by X0 through the left fSL(3, R)-action. Therefore

˜g([X, Y ], Z) = gx([X, Y ]x, Zx) = g([X, Y ], Z)|x = g([ρx(X0) + X ∗

0 , Y ], Z)|x
= g([ρx(X0), Y ], Z)|x = ρx(X0)g(Y, Z)|x − g(Y, [ρx(X0), Z])|x
= −g(Y, [ρx(X0), Z])|x = −g(Y, [ρx(X0) + X ∗
= −g(Y, [X, Z])|x = −gx(Yx, [Xx, Zx]) = −˜g(Y, [X, Z]).

0 , Z])|x

0 is the vector ﬁeld on fM

17

Where we have used the fact that H centralizes X ∗
0 and that ρx(X0) is a Killing
vector ﬁeld, for the metric g, which vanishes in x. Thus, we take ¯g as the pullback
of ˜g by the isomorphism ψ to obtain the desired result.
(cid:3)

Now, by the previous lemma and Lemma A.4, we can rescale the metric along

the bundles T F and T F ⊥ in fM such that the new metric, bg, on fM satisﬁes that
K = (dpe)∗(bgx), is the Killing form on g2(2).
Since the elements of H ⊂ Kill(fM ) preserve the direct sum decomposition, T fM =
T F ⊕ T F ⊥, then H ⊂ Kill(fM ,bg). Note that bg is invariant under both the left
fSL(3, R)-action and the right G2(2)-action on fM . Observe, also, that the metric bg

can be obtained from the lift of a correspondingly rescaled metric on M .

Consider the bi-invariant metric on G2(2) induced by the Killing form K, which
we denote with the same letter. The previous argument and discussion imply that
the local diﬀeomorphism

is a local isometry. This last property of p, the completeness of (G2(2), K) and the

p : (G2(2), K) → (fM ,bg)

simply completeness of (fM ,bg) imply, by Corollary 20 in [5, p. 202], that p is an

isometry.

Proposition 5.3. Let M be an analytic connected ﬁnite volume pseudo-Riema-
nnian manifold with dim(M ) = 14.
If M is complete, admits an analytic and
isometric right SL(3, R)-action with a dense orbit such that H (Lemma 2.6) is a
simple Lie algebra with dim(H) = 14. Then there exists an analytic diﬀeomorphism

(ii) p is G2(2)-equivariant for the right G2(2)-action on its domain,

p : G2(2) → fM and an analytic isometric right G2(2)-action on fM such that:
(i) On fM , the left fSL(3, R)-action and the right G2(2)-action commute,
(iii) for a pseudo-Riemannian metric bg in fM obtained by rescaling the original
metric on the summands of the decomposition T fM = T F ⊕ T F ⊥, the map

p : (G2(2), K) → (fM ,bg)

is an isometry where K is the bi-invariant metric on G2(2) induced from
the Killing form of its Lie algebra.

Considering G2(2) with the bi-invariant pseudo-Riemannian metric K, induced
by the Killing form of its Lie algebra, we can assume that (G2(2), K) is the isometric

universal covering space of (fM ,bg).

By Proposition 4.5 of [7] we have that the isometry group of the pseudo-Rieman-
nian manifold (G2(2), K), which we denote by Iso(G2(2)), has only a ﬁnite number
of connected components. Such proposition also shows that

Iso(G2(2))0 = L(G2(2))R(G2(2)),

where L(G2(2)) and R(G2(2)) are the subgroups of left and right translations on
G2(2), respectively.

Let ̺ : fSL(3, R) → Iso(G2(2)) be the homomorphism induced by the isometric
left fSL(3, R)-action on G2(2). From the previous observations, the covering

G2(2) × G2(2) → L(G2(2))R(G2(2))

18

RA ´UL QUIROGA-BARRANCO AND ELI ROBLERO-M ´ENDEZ

yields the existence of homomorphisms ̺1, ̺2 : fSL(3, R) → G2(2) such that

̺(g) = L̺1(g) ◦ R̺2(g)−1

∀g ∈ fSL(3, R).

By Proposition 5.3, we have that ̺(g) ◦ Rh = Rh ◦ ̺(g) for all g ∈ fSL(3, R)
and h ∈ G2(2), which implies that ̺2(fSL(3, R)) is contained in the center of G2(2),
thence ̺(g) = L̺1(g) for all g ∈ fSL(3, R). Thus, the fSL(3, R)-action on G2(2) is
induced by the homomorphism ̺1 : fSL(3, R) → G2(2) and the left action of G2(2)

onto itself. Note, by our hypotheses, that the homomorphism ̺1 is non-trivial.

By Proposition 5.3 we have that π1(M ) ⊂ Iso(G2(2)) and by the previous obser-
vations Γ1 = π1(M ) ∩ Iso0(G2(2)) is a ﬁnite index subgroup of π1(M ). Therefore,
for every γ ∈ Γ1 there exist h1, h2 ∈ G2(2) such that γ = Lh1 ◦ Rh2 .

Since the left fSL(3, R)-action on G2(2) is the lift of an action on M , this left
fSL(3, R)-action commutes with the Γ1-action. Applying that property to Lh1 ◦
Rh2 = γ ∈ Γ1 we obtain that Lh1 ◦ L̺1(g) = L̺1(g) ◦ Lh1 for all g ∈ fSL(3, R), thus
Γ1 ∈ L(Z(fSL(3, R)))R(G2(2)) where Z(fSL(3, R)) is the centralizer of ̺1(fSL(3, R))
in G2(2). By Lemma A.2, the center of G2(2) has ﬁnite index in Z(fSL(3, R)) and
therefore R(G2(2)) has ﬁnite index in L(fSL(3, R))R(G2(2)).

Γ1 ∩ R(G2(2)) is a ﬁnite index subgroup of Γ1 and also of π1(M ).

In particular, Γ =

The natural identiﬁcation of R(G2(2)) with G2(2) realizes Γ as a discrete subgroup

of G2(2) such that G2(2)/Γ is a ﬁnite covering space of M .

Let ϕ : G2(2)/Γ → M be the corresponding covering map. For the left fSL(3, R)-
action on G2(2)/Γ given by the homomorphism ̺1 : fSL(3, R) → G2(2), the con-
structions in the previous paragraphs show that the map ϕ is fSL(3, R)-equivariant.
Finally, we note that ϕ is a local isometry for the metric bg, on fM considered in
proof of that result it is enough to prove that M has ﬁnite volume in the metric bg.

Next, we are going to show that the subgroup Γ is a lattice in G2(2). For the

Recall, we are assuming that M has ﬁnite volume in its original metric.

Proposition 5.3.

Lemma 5.4. If vol and volbg denote the volume elements on M for the original
metric and the rescaled metric, respectively. Then, there is some constant C > 0
such that volbg = Cvol.

Proof. We consider (x1, x2, . . . , x14) some coordinate of M in a neighborhood U of
a given point such that (x1, . . . , x8) deﬁnes a set of coordinates of the leaves of the
foliation F in such neighborhood. For the original metric g on M , consider the
orthogonal bundle T F ⊥ and a set of 1-forms θ1, . . . , θ6 that deﬁne a basis for its
dual (T F ⊥)∗ at every point in U . Thus, in U the metric g has an expression of the
form:

g =

8X

i,j=1

lijdxi ⊗ dxj +

6X

i,j=1

hijθi ⊗ θj .

From this and the deﬁnition of the volume element as an 14-form, we have:

vol = q| det(lij ) det(hij )|dx1 ∧ . . . ∧ dx8 ∧ θ1 ∧ · · · ∧ θ6.

RIGIDITY OF AN ISOMETRIC SL(3, R)-ACTION

19

On the other hand, since the metric bg is obtained by rescaling g along the bundles

T O and T O⊥, then has an expression of the form:

8X

i,j=1

bg =

C1lijdxi ⊗ dxj +

6X

i,j=1

C2hij θi ⊗ θj.

for some constants C1, C2 6= 0. Therefore, the volume element of bg satisﬁes:
volbg = q| det(C1lij) det(C2hij)|dx1 ∧ . . . ∧ dx8 ∧ θ1 ∧ · · · ∧ θ6

= q|C8

5.2.2. H ≃ sl(4, R). Here, we assume H0(x) ≃ R and that H is a simple Lie algebra
then, by Lemma 4.3(2), our centralizer H is isomorphic to sl(4, R). Therefore, we
have our following result

Lemma 5.5. There is an isomorphism

ψ : sl(4, R) = sl(3, R) ⊕ R ⊕ R3 ⊕ R3∗ → G(x) ⊕ H0(x) ⊕ V(x) ⊕ V ∗(x) = H

of Lie algebras that preserves the summands in that order. In particular, ψ is an
isomorphism of sl(3, R)-modules.

Proof. Similar to the proof of Lemma 5.1.

(cid:3)

Let us ﬁx an isomorphism of Lie algebras ψ : sl(4, R) → H as in the previous

lemma. Let fSL(4, R) denote the universal covering of SL(4, R) then Lie(fSL(4, R)) =
sl(4, R). By Lemma 2.8, there exists an analytic isometric right fSL(4, R)-action on
fM such that ψ(X) = X ∗, for every X ∈ sl(4, R). This right action centralizes the
left fSL(3, R)-action on fM and thus preserves the bundles T F and T F ⊥.
Given the previous right fSL(4, R)-action on fM we deﬁne the map p : fSL(4, R) →
fM deﬁned as g 7→ x · g, for all g ∈ fSL(4, R). Observe that this map is fSL(4, R)-
Let H be a connected subgroup of fSL(4, R) such that Lie(H) = ψ−1(H0(x)).

invariant for the right action on its domain satisfying dpe(X) = X ∗
every X ∈ sl(3, R). Note that dpe is surjective with ker(dpe) = ψ−1(H0(x).

Here, H is not a compact subgroup and, by exercise (vi) in [4, p. 152], a closed
subgroup. Hence, the map

x = ψ(X) for

p : H\fSL(4, R) → fM ,

[g] = Hg 7→ x · g,

sl(3, R) ⊕ R3 ⊕ R3∗.

for all Hg ∈ H\fSL(4, R) → fM , is well deﬁned. Observe that THe(cid:0)H\fSL(4, R)(cid:1) =
sl(3, R) onto T F and R3 ⊕ R3∗ onto T F ⊥. Since p is an fSL(4, R)-equivariant map

By our choice of the map ψ we have that dpHe is an isomorphism which maps

for the right action on its domain then p is an analytic local diﬀeomorphism at He.
The deﬁnition of the map p and Lemma 5.5 imply that that dpHe = evx ◦ ψ
restricted to the subspace sl(3, R) ⊕ R3 ⊕ R3∗. This map induces a metric on

H\fSL(4, R), which is the result of the next lemma.
Lemma 5.6. Let ¯g be the metric on THe(H\fSL(4, R)) deﬁned as the pullback under
d¯p[e] of the metric gx on TxfM , then ¯g is sl(3, R)-invariant.

Since the metric g in TxfM is invariant under the action of ρx(sl(3, R)(x)) we
have that if u, v ∈ THe(H\fSL(4, R)) and X ∈ sl(3, R) then, by Lemma 2.7 there

= −¯g(v, [X0, w]) = −¯g(v, [X, w]),

Recall that H centralizes X ∗ and ρx0(X) is a Killing ﬁeld for the metric g in fM .

Therefore, by properties of the maps evx0 and ϕ, the metric ¯g in

is sl(3, R)-invariant.

THe(H\fSL(4, R)) = sl(3, R) ⊕ R3 ⊕ R3∗.

(cid:3)

Next, we analyze the pseudo-Riemannian metric structure of the analytic mani-

fold H\fSL(4, R).

First, let Kn be the Killing form on sl(n, R) with n ≥ 2. Recall that Kn(X, Y ) =
2n · tr(XY ) for all X, Y ∈ sl(n, R). By the decomposition of sl(4, R) as sl(3, R)-
module in Section 1 and the deﬁnition of the Killing form we have that sl(3, R),
R3 ⊕ R3∗ and sl(3, R) ⊕ R3 ⊕ R3∗ (as subspaces of sl(4, R)) are non-degenerate with
respect to the Killing form K4.

Denote by K 1, K 2 and K the restriction of K4 to the subspaces sl(3, R), R3 ⊕ R3∗
and sl(3, R) ⊕ R3 ⊕ R3∗, respectively. Since K4 is invariant by the adjoint action of
sl(4, R) then it is clear that K4 is also invariant under the adjoint action of sl(3, R),
by its inclusion in sl(4, R). Therefore, K 1, K 2 and K are invariant by the adjoint
action of sl(3, R).

Remark 5.7. By the deﬁnition and properties of K 1 and since sl(3, R) is a simple
Lie algebra we have, by Schur’s Lemma, that K 1 = c1K3, with c1 6= 0. On the other
hand, by Section 1 and Lemma A.3, we have that K 2 = K4|R3⊕R3∗ is a non-zero
multiple of a unique sl(3, R)-invariant symmetric bilinear form on R3 ⊕ R3∗.

Let π : fSL(4, R) → H\fSL(4, R) be the natural quotient map. With respect to

the previous map, we assume that

(5.3)

dπ0 = dπ|sl(3,R)⊕R3⊕R3∗ : sl(3, R) ⊕ R3 ⊕ R3∗ → THeH\fSL(4, R)

coset (see [5, p. 310]). On the other hand, by properties of the Killing form K4
and the deﬁnition of K, we have that K is Ad(H)-invariant. Thus, such result and

By its construction, we have that the quotient space H\fSL(4, R) is a reductive
the isometry (5.3) imply, by Proposition 22 in [5, p. 311], the fSL(4, R)-invariance
on H\fSL(4, R). Therefore, by Lemma 5.5, the properties of K4 and the isometry
(5.3) we have that the manifold H\fSL(4, R) is a naturally reductive homogeneous
we have that H\fSL(4, R) is complete (see [5, p. 313]), hence, by Lemma 24 in
[5, p. 312], our quotient map π : fSL(4, R) → H\fSL(4, R) is a pseudo-Riemannian
Next, we show that we can rescale the metric on fM such that the pullback of

this new metric, with respect to the map ¯p, implies that (5.3) is, eﬀectively, a linear
isometry. But, ﬁrst we need the following result.

As a consequence that our manifold is a naturally reductive homogeneous space

submersion.

Lemma 5.8. Let h·, ·i1 and h·, ·i2 be the inner products on sl(3, R) and R3 ⊕ R3∗,
respectively. Assume that h·, ·i1 and h·, ·i2 are sl(3, R)-invariant. Then there exist
c1, c2 ∈ R such that

is K, the Killing form of sl(4, R) restricted to sl(3, R) ⊕ R3 ⊕ R3∗.

c1h·, ·i1 + c2h·, ·i2,

Proof. Recall, Schur’s Lemma implies that in g, a simple real Lie algebra with a
simple complexiﬁcation, any g-invariant non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form
on g is a multiple by a real scalar of the Killing form.

On the other hand, we have proved in Lemma A.4 that there is, up to a multiple
by a real scalar, a unique sl(3, R)-invariant non-degenerate bilinear form on R3⊕R3∗.
(cid:3)

Now, the result follows from previous results.

Remark 5.9. By the results in Lemmas 5.6 and 5.8, we can rescale the metric

g along the bundles T F and T F ⊥ on fM such that the new metric, bg, satisﬁes
(cid:0)d ¯fHe(cid:1)∗
(bgx) = K, the Killing form on sl(4, R) restricted to sl(3, R) ⊕ R3 ⊕ R3∗.
Since the elements in H preserve the decomposition T fM = T F ⊕ T F ⊥, then
H ⊂ Kill(fM ,bg). That is, the elements in H are Killing vector ﬁelds for the metric bg
rescaled as in Remark 5.9. Therefore, bg is invariant under the right fSL(4, R)-action.
In a similar way, the left fSL(3, R)-action on fM preserves the rescaled metric bg. Note
that bg on fM can be obtained as the lift of a correspondingly rescaled metric bg in

M .

Remark 5.9 implies that the local diﬀeomorphism

¯p : (H\fSL(4, R), K) → (fM ,bg)

is a local isometry. Thus, the completeness of (H\fSL(4, R), K) and the simple
completeness of fM imply, by Corollary 29 in [5, p. 202], that ¯p is an isometry.

Therefore our next result.

Proposition 5.10. Let M be a connected analytic pseudo-Riemannian manifold.
Suppose that M is complete, has ﬁnite volume and admits an analytic and isometric
SL(3, R)-action with a dense orbit such that the centralizer of this action, H, is a Lie
algebra simple with dim(H) = 15. If dim(M ) = 14, then there exists an analytic

diﬀeomorphism ¯p : H\fSL(4, R) → fM and an analytic isometric right fSL(4, R)-
action on fM such that:
(1) on fM the left fSL(3, R)-action and the right fSL(4, R)-action commute with
(2) ¯p is fSL(4, R)-equivariant for the right fSL(4, R)-action on its domain,
(3) for a pseudo-Riemannian metric bg in fM obtained by rescaling the original

metric on the summands of T fM = T F ⊕ T F ⊥, the map

¯p : (H\fSL(4, R), K) → (fM ,bg)

is an isometry where K is the metric on H\fSL(4, R) which makes of the

quotient map π a pseudo-Riemannian submersion.

Appendix A.

With the deﬁnitions and results from [6] we have the next Lemma.

Lemma A.1. Suppose that ρ : sl(3, R) → g2(2) is an injective Lie algebra homo-
morphism. Then s = ρ(sl(3, R)) is a subalgebra of g2(2) with its centralizer, zg(s),
equal to zero.

Lemma A.2. Suppose that G is a connected Lie group locally isomorphic to G2(2)

as a ﬁnite index subgroup.

and consider ι : fSL(3, R) → G a non trivial homomorphism of Lie groups. Then,
the centralizer ZG(ι(fSL(3, R))) of ι(fSL(3, R)) in G contains Z(G) (the center of G)
Proof. Let S = ι(fSL(3, R)) and denote the Lie algebra of S as s. Since Z(G) ⊆

ZG(S) and, by the previous Lemma, zg(s) = 0 then ZG(S) and Z(G) are discrete.
The proof that ZG(S) is ﬁnite is a consequence of Lemma 1.1.3.7 in [12].
(cid:3)

We prove now the relationship between the Killing form on the simple Lie group
g2(2) and the sl(3, R)-invariant bilinear form, both obtained in sl(3, R) and R3⊕R3∗.
But before we need the following result.

Lemma A.3. There is, up to a multiple by a real scalar, exactly one sl(3, R)-
invariant non-degenerate bilinear form on R3 ⊕ R3∗.

Proof. We have proved that there exists in R3 ⊕ R3∗ a sl(3, R)-invariant non-
degenerate bilinear form. This has as consequence the existence of an isomorphism
̺ : R3 ⊕ R3∗ → (R3 ⊕ R3∗)∗ of sl(3, R)-modules.

Then we have an isomorphism ̺(C) : C3 ⊕ C3∗ → C3 ⊕ C3∗ of sl(3, C)-modules,
that by Schur’s Lemma, is just the multiple of the identity by a complex number
when restricted to C3 and to another complex number when restricted to C3∗.
Furthermore, since ̺(C) is the complexiﬁcation of ̺ we have that these numbers
are real.

The result follows from the previous arguments and the fact that R3 and R3∗
(cid:3)

belong to the nullcone of the inner product.

Lemma A.4. Let h·, ·i1 and h·, ·i2 be inner products on sl(3, R) and R3 ⊕ R3∗,
respectively. If we suppose that h·, ·i1 and h·, ·i2 are sl(3, R)-invariant. Then, there
exist a1, a2 ∈ R such that a1h·, ·i1 + a2h·, ·i2 is the Killing form of g2(2).

RIGIDITY OF AN ISOMETRIC SL(3, R)-ACTION

23

Proof. Recall that Schur’s Lemma implies that in g, a simple real Lie algebra with
a simple complexiﬁcation, any g-invariant non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form
on g is unique up to a multiple, that is, the multiple by a scalar of the Killing form.
In particular, we have that h·, ·i1 is a multiple of the Killing form of g2(2) (K)
when restricted to sl(3, R), this is hX, Y i1 = c1K|sl(3,R)(X, Y ) for all X, Y ∈ sl(3, R)
and some non-zero c1 ∈ R.

On the other hand, from Lemma A.3 we have the existence of a non-zero scalar

c2 ∈ R such that h·, ·i2 = c2K|R3⊕R3∗ (·, ·).

Now, the result is a consequence of the previous arguments and Lemma A.3. (cid:3)
