ABSTRACT
The dynamics of solid bodies in protoplanetary disks are subject to the properties of
any underlying gas turbulence. Turbulence driven by disk self-gravity shows features
distinct from those driven by the magnetorotational instability (MRI). We study the
dynamics of solids in gravito-turbulent disks with two-dimensional (in the disk plane),
hybrid (particle and gas) simulations. Gravito-turbulent disks can exhibit stronger
gravitational stirring than MRI-active disks, resulting in greater radial diﬀusion and
larger eccentricities and relative speeds for large particles (those with dimensionless
stopping times tstopΩ > 1, where Ω is the orbital frequency). The agglomeration
of large particles into planetesimals by pairwise collisions is therefore disfavored in
gravito-turbulent disks. However, the relative speeds of intermediate-size particles
(tstopΩ ∼ 1) are signiﬁcantly reduced as such particles are collected by gas drag and
gas gravity into coherent ﬁlament-like structures with densities high enough to trig-
ger gravitational collapse. First-generation planetesimals may form via gravitational
instability of dust in marginally gravitationally unstable gas disks.

1 INTRODUCTION

As protoplanetary disks are often thought to be turbulent
(Armitage 2011; but see Flaherty et al. 2015), understand-
ing how disk solids interact with turbulent gas is crucial to
modelling the formation of planetesimals and planets (Wei-
denschilling & Cuzzi 1993; Chiang & Youdin 2010; Johansen
et al. 2014; Testi et al. 2014) and to explaining observations
of disks (Williams & Cieza 2011; Andrews 2015). Turbu-
lence determines the spatial distribution of solid particles
and their relative collision velocities (“turbulent stirring”;
Voelk et al. 1980; Cuzzi et al. 1993; Youdin & Lithwick
2007; Ormel & Cuzzi 2007). For example, dust particles can
be concentrated in local pressure maxima at the interstices
of turbulent eddies; pressure bumps can also be found in
spiral density waves, anti-cyclonic vortices, or zonal ﬂows
associated with whatever mechanism drives disk transport
(Maxey 1987; Klahr & Bodenheimer 2003; Rice et al. 2004;
Barranco & Marcus 2005; Mamatsashvili & Rice 2009; Jo-
hansen et al. 2009, 2011; Pan et al. 2011). Turbulent density
ﬂuctuations can also exert stochastic gravitational torques
on solid objects and alter their orbital dynamics (“gravita-
tional stirring”; Laughlin et al. 2004; Nelson 2005; Ogihara
et al. 2007; Ida et al. 2008).

Disk self-gravity can drive turbulence, provided disks

are suﬃciently massive and provided their cooling times
are longer than their dynamical times (Paczynski 1978;
Gammie 2001; Forgan et al. 2012; Shi & Chiang 2014).
“Gravito-turbulence” may characterize the early phase of
star formation, when disks are still massive (Rodr´ıguez et al.
2005; Eisner et al. 2005; Andrews & Williams 2007). Ob-
servations show signs of early grain growth in some very
young stellar systems (Ricci et al. 2010; Tobin et al. 2013).
Millimeter-sized chondrules in primitive meteorites indicate
they might once have been melted via strong shock waves in
self-gravitating disks (Cuzzi & Alexander 2006; Alexander
et al. 2008). Simulations suggest large dust concentrations
via spiral waves and vortices present in gravito-turbulent
disks, possibly leading to planetesimal formation via gravita-
tional instability in the dust itself (Rice et al. 2004; Gibbons
et al. 2015).

Many studies of dust dynamics to date focus on
particles in disks made turbulent by the magneto-rotational
instability (MRI; Balbus & Hawley 1991, 1998). Both an-
alytical and numerical works have been carried out to ob-
tain radial/vertical diﬀusivities and particle relative veloc-
ities due to turbulent stirring (Cuzzi et al. 1993; Youdin
& Lithwick 2007; Ormel & Cuzzi 2007; Carballido et al.
2010, 2011; Zhu et al. 2015). For large particles, gravita-
tional forces by MRI-turbulent density ﬂuctuations exceed
aerodynamic drag forces by gas and generate relative parti-
cle velocities too high to be conducive to planetesimal for-

mation (Nelson 2005; Johnson et al. 2006; Yang et al. 2009,
2012; Nelson & Gressel 2010; Gressel et al. 2012). A few use-
ful metrics common to many of these papers include: (1) the
diﬀusion coeﬃcient, which characterizes how quickly solids
random walk through the disk, (2) the particle eccentricity
or velocity dispersion, and (3) the pairwise relative velocity,
which is crucial for determining collision outcomes. Quantity
(2) usually serves as a good proxy for quantity (3).1

Relatively fewer groups investigated the dynamics of
dust in turbulence driven by disk self-gravity. Gibbons et al.
(2012, 2014, 2015) study particles with a range of sizes (with
stopping times tstop = 10−2–102Ω−1, where Ω is the local
orbital frequency) accumulate in local, two-dimensional (in
the disk plane) simulations. They ﬁnd that intermediate-
sized dust can concentrate by up to two orders of magni-
tude, and that the dispersion of particle velocites can ap-
proach the gas sound speed, consistent with the results of
2D global simulations (Rice et al. 2004, 2006). Britsch et al.
(2008) and Walmswell et al. (2013) ﬁnd strong eccentricity
growth for large-sized planetesimals forced more by gravi-
tational stirring than by gas drag. Boss (2015) investigates
the radial diﬀusion process for particles 1 cm–10 m in size
(tstop ∼ 10−2–1Ω−1 in their model), ﬁnding enhanced diﬀu-
sion for m-sized or larger bodies.

However, no systematic study has yet been performed
to directly measure the dynamical properties (diﬀusivi-
ties, eccentricities, and relative speeds as listed above)
of solids in gravito-turbulent disks as has been done for
MRI-active disks. Gravito-turbulence tends to produce rel-
atively stronger density ﬂuctuations (δρ/ρ ∼ 1 for a typical
Shakura-Sunyaev turbulence parameter α ∼ 10−2; see Shi &
Chiang 2014) than are seen in MRI turbulence (δρ/ρ ∼ 0.1
for α ∼ 10−2). The prominent spiral density features that
characterize self-gravitating disks and that help trap dust
particles are also absent in MRI-turbulent disks.

It is the goal of this paper to study the dynamics and
spatial distribution of dust in gravito-turbulent disks in a
systematic manner, placing our measurements into direct
comparison with analogous measurements made for MRI-
turbulent disks. We ﬁrst describe our simulation setup in
section 2. Results are given in section 3, where we describe
the radial diﬀusion, eccentricity growth, and relative ve-
locities of particles, and how these quantities are aﬀected
by gravitational stirring, particle stopping time, gas cooling
rate, numerical resolution, and simulation domain size. In
section 4, we put our results into physical context, discuss
their astrophysical implications, and make comparison with
MRI-active disks. We conclude in section 5.

2 METHODS

2.1 Equations solved and code description

We study the diﬀusion of solids in gravito-turbulent disks
using hybrid (particle+ﬂuid) hydro simulations in the disk
plane.

For the gas, we solve the hydrodynamic equations gov-
erning 2D, self-gravitating accretion disks, including the ef-

fects of secular cooling. The disk is modeled in the local
shearing sheet approximation assuming the disk aspect ra-
tio H/r (cid:28) 1. In a Cartesian reference frame corotating with
the disk at ﬁxed orbital frequency Ω, the equations solved
are similar to those Shi & Chiang (2014), but restricted to
be in the disk plane:

We choose a very simple cooling function,

with β ≡ Ωtcool constant everywhere. The assumption of
constant cooling time tcool is adopted by many 2D (e.g.,
Gammie 2001; Johnson & Gammie 2003; Paardekooper
2012) and three-dimensional (3D) (e.g., Rice et al. 2003;

2009; Meru & Bate 2011) simulations of self-gravitating
disks. This prescription enables direct experimental control
over the rate of energy loss.

For the solids, we assume the dust particles only pas-
sively respond to the GT turbulence via the aerodynamical
drag and also the gravitational acceleration from the gas. No
particle feedback is included in this study. In the 2D local
approximation, the equation of particle motion reads

the i–th particle specie relative to the background shear.

Our simulations are run with Athena (Stone et al. 2008)
with the built-in particle module (Bai & Stone 2010). We
adopt the van Leer integrator (van Leer 2006; Stone & Gar-
diner 2009), a piecewise linear spatial reconstruction in the
primitive variables, and the HLLC (Harten-Lax-van Leer-
Contact) Riemann solver. We solve Poisson’s equation of a
razor-thin disk using fast Fourier transforms (Gammie 2001;

MNRAS 000, 1–19 (2016)

Paardekooper 2012)2 Boundary conditions for our physical
variables (ρ, v, U , and Φ) are shearing-periodic in radius (x)
and periodic in azimuth (y). We also use orbital advection
algorithms to shorten the timestep and improve conserva-
tion (Masset 2000; Johnson et al. 2008; Stone & Gardiner
2010).

2.2 Initial conditions and run setup

where cs = (cid:112)Γ(Γ − 1)U/Σ is the sound speed. The ve-

We start with pure gas simulations. At t = 0 we initialize
a uniformly distributed gas disk and set Σ0 = Ω = G = 1.
The thermal energy is such that Q = csΩ/(πGΣ0) = 1.1
close to the critical Toomre Q-parameter for a razor-thin
disk ((cid:39) 1; Toomre 1964; Goldreich & Lynden-Bell 1965),
locity is u0 = (δx,−qΩx + δy), where δx and δy are ran-
domized perturbations at ∼1% of the initial sound speed
cs0 = 1.1π. Our simulation domain is a box which covers
[−80, 80] GΣ0/Ω2 in both radial (x) and azimuthal (y) direc-
tion with 5122 grid points. This amounts to a spatial span
of 160H/(πQ) (cid:39) 51Q−1H and a resolution of (cid:39) 10Q/H,
where H ≡ cs/Ω = πQ(GΣ0/Ω2) is the disk scale height.
We allow the disk to cool oﬀ immediately with a ﬁxed
cooling time tcoolΩ ∈ {5, 10, 20, 40}. After a short transient
phase which normally takes about twice the cooling time,
the disk settles to a quasi-steady gravito-turbulent state in
which the heating from compression and shocks is balanced
by the imposed cell-by-cell cooling. For example, we show
the time evolution of Reynolds and gravitational stresses,
surface density and velocity dispersions and Toomre’s Q pa-
rameter from the tcoolΩ = 10 case in Figure 1.
All quantities saturate after ≥ 20Ω−1, and well estab-
lished turbulence sustains to the end of the simulations (hun-
dreds of dynamical times). The time averaged (t > 50Ω−1)
nominal α, i.e., stresses normalized with pressure, is α (cid:39)
0.020 for the sum of the Reynolds and gravitational stress.
Toomre’s Q is hovering ∼ 3 (Gammie 2001) which also sets
the spatial averaged sound speed (cid:104)cs(cid:105) = πQ(GΣ0/Ω). The
Q-parameter using density weighted sound speed (cid:104)cs(cid:105)Σ (red
dashed curve in bottom right panel) shows less ﬂuctuation
and slightly diminished (∼ 10%) mean. We choose the den-
sity weighted measure hereafter and simply use (cid:104)cs(cid:105) to rep-
resent the density weighted sound speed. But we do note
that the spatial and temporal averaged velocity dispersion
(cid:104)ux(cid:105) (black) is about twice the density weighted value (cid:104)ux(cid:105)Σ
(red) as shown in the bottom left panel of Figure 1. The
cause and eﬀects will be discussed in section 3.2. We also
emphasize that the density dispersion δΣg/Σ0 (cid:39) 0.6 for
α ∼ 0.02, much stronger than found in the MRI-driven tur-
bulence case where δρ/ρ ∼ √
0.5α ∼ 0.1 for similar α values
with or without net weak magnetic ﬁeld (Nelson & Gres-
sel 2010; Okuzumi & Hirose 2011; Shi et al. 2016). We will
discuss it further in section 3.7.

We then randomly distribute dust particles in space at

2 In this paper, we do not smooth the potential over a length δ
in the z-direction to mimic the ﬁnite thickness of the disk, as we
ﬁnd the density and velocity dispersions in our unsmoothed 2D
simulations to be similar to those in 3D (Shi & Chiang 2014). The
eﬀect of smoothing on the perturbations is modest; e.g., δΣ/Σ
decreases by at most a factor of two when δ = cs/Ω is used.

t = 50Ω−1 (for tcoolΩ ≤ 20) or 100Ω−1 (for tcoolΩ = 40),
and evolve the particle+ﬂuid system for another 200Ω−1.
We implemented seven types of particles with constant stop-
ping time such that the Stokes number τs ≡ Ωtstop ∈
[10−3, 10−2, 0.1, 1, 10, 102, 103], evenly spaced in logarithmic
scale. For each type, we use 219 (∼5 × 105) particles, or ∼ 2
particles per grid cell on average. Their velocities follow the
background shear initially. Since gas densities vary in time
and space, it would be more physical to ﬁx the size of each
particle rather than its stopping time; nevertheless, our de-
fault simulations ﬁx stopping times to more easily compare
with previous simulations that do likewise. We also verify ex-
plicitly that our simulations with ﬁxed stopping time agree
well with a simulation that uses ﬁxed particle sizes (see Sec-
tion 3.6). For this latter run, we employ a stopping time
based on the Epstein drag law:

3 RESULTS

3.1 Standard run

We ﬁrst present our standard run tc=10, i.e., tcoolΩ = 10
run (see Table 1 for the gas properties). After distributing
the particles randomly on the grid, the particles quickly ad-
just in response to the dynamical gas ﬂows. After ∼ 20Ω−1,
the distribution of particles reaches a steady state. As an
illustration, we have shown the gas and dust density in Fig-
ure 2 at t = 180Ω−1. Clearly, the small particles (τs ≤ 10−2)
are nearly perfectly coupled to the gas and therefore share
the same density structures of the gas. Particles with inter-
mediate stopping time, for both τs = 0.1 and 1, appear to
concentrate along the dense gas ﬁlaments and cause dust
density enhancement of two orders of magnitude relative
to the mean (note the color bars for τs = 0.1 and 1 now
extend to higher values). Transient vortices are also observ-
able in the snapshots for gas and τs < 1 particles, but are
probably under-resolved; see Gibbons et al. (2015) for the ef-
fects of vortices on particle concentration. For large particles
(τs ≥ 10), they are strongly disturbed by the gravitational
stirring from the ﬂuctuating gas (see further discussion of
the eﬀects of gravity in section 3.5). After ∼ 20Ω−1, they
are completely redistributed and their end status recovers a
random distribution similar to the initial.

In Figure 3, we show the time-averaged fraction of cu-
mulative mass for each type of particle, binned in local sur-
face density (number of particles in each cell) normalized
to the mean (2/cell). The running proﬁles of small sized
particles resemble that of the time-averaged gas (solid black
curve). Those with large stopping times track the initial ran-
dom distribution (dotted black). In contrast, the blue (τs =
1) and green (τs = 0.1) curves show that intermediate-sized
particles exhibit relatively higher densities, Σp/(cid:104)Σp(cid:105) ∼ 10–
100.
After reaching quasi-steady state, we further evolve the
dust+gas mixture for a total duration of 200Ω−1. We then

measure the radial diﬀusion coeﬃcients, particle eccentricity
and relative velocities averaged over all particles of the same
type. The results are presented in the following subsections.

3.2 Radial diﬀusion

We utilize the following formula to derive the radial diﬀusion
coeﬃcients Dp,x of diﬀerent types of particles in our simu-
lations (Youdin & Lithwick 2007; Carballido et al. 2011):

Dp,x ≡ 1

d(cid:104)|xp(t) − xp(0)|2(cid:105)

dt

,

(10)

where Dp,x is the diﬀusion coeﬃcient for given particle stop-
ping time, xp(t) and xp(0) are the radial position at time t
and initial (taken to be 50Ω−1 after injecting the particles to
the gas disk). The radial coordinate is extended beyond the
edges of the sheet so that particles moves on radially without
periodic boundary conditions. The measurements are made
at every time interval δt = 0.5Ω−1, and are performed for
a duration of 150Ω−1 long. The average (cid:104)(cid:105) here is taken for
all particles within the same type.

The squared displacements as a function of time on the
right hand side of Equation (10) are shown in the left panel
of Figure 4. Each curve represents the displacement of one

distinctive type of particles. For particles of τs ≤ 0.1, the
curves overlap. As they are well-coupled with the turbu-
lent gas ﬂows, their displacements reﬂect the properties of
gas diﬀusion. For larger particles, the gravitational stirring
dominates the drag force which introduces some extra eﬀec-
tive diﬀusion. As a result, the displacement curves of those
particles have bigger slopes. For the largest two dust species
we implemented, the curves show periodic oscillations which
are due to the epicyclic motion of individual particles. The
large amplitude of the epicyclic motion is a result of the
strong gravitational forcing of the background gas.

Now with the help of Equation 10 and Figure 4, we can
derive the radial diﬀusion coeﬃcients based on the slope of
the squared displacements using linear ﬁtting. The results
are shown in the right panel of Figure 4 and also recorded
in Table 2. The radial diﬀusion coeﬃcients Dp,x are normal-
ized against the gas diﬀusion coeﬃcient Dg,x; the latter is
approximated using the Dp,x of particles with τs = 10−3. We
ﬁnd Dp,x (cid:39) Dg,x for τs ≤ 0.1. However, Dp,x exceeds Dg,x
for particles with longer tstop, and stay roughly constant,
Dp,x ∼ 6–8Dg,x. For comparison, we also plot the diﬀusion
coeﬃcient predicted by models in Cuzzi et al. (1993, dotted
gray curve) and Youdin & Lithwick (2007, dashed gray).
Both predict small and decreasing values for larger particles
based on homogeneous turbulence without extra forcing like

small velocity, but the gas in low density region has very
high velocity (∼ cs). The auto-correlation function deﬁned
above would strongly bias toward the low density instead of
the high density region where most of the small dust parti-
cles reside. One way to remove the bias is to calculate the
gas or dust3 density weighted auto-correlation function

in which ux(0) and Σ(0) are velocity and density at a refer-
ence time, ux(τ ) and Σ(τ ) are measured at time τ from the
reference point and are both sheared back to that point in
order to calculate the correlation. Shown in Figure 5 is the
velocity auto-correlation calculated with (solid curve) and
without (dashed curve) density weight. Integrating the den-
sity weighted Rxx, we get Dg,x (cid:39) 0.014(cid:104)(cid:104)cs(cid:105)(cid:105)Ω−1 close to the
Dp,x (cid:39) 0.012(cid:104)(cid:104)cs(cid:105)(cid:105)Ω−1 measured with particles of τs = 10−3.
However, using Rxx without density weight would overesti-
mate the diﬀusion coeﬃcient by a factor of 15.

3.3 Eccentricity growth

When particle eccentricity is small, we have the relation

x (cid:39) 2v2

y (cid:39) e2Ω2r2 .

(13)

We can therefore measure the orbital eccentricity of each
individual particle according to this relation, and obtain the
evolution of the eccentricity as shown in Figure 6. Although
the initial e = 0, we ﬁnd the mean eccentricity quickly
saturates at e (cid:39) 0.2-0.3(H/R) for particles of τs ≤ 1. It

the gas density would change the estimated diﬀusion coeﬃcient
by ∼10%.

ﬁcially suppressed (see section 3.5), we do recover similar
relationship as they predicted.

We also check the validity of approximating Dg,x with
Dp,x by measuring the auto-correlation function of the tur-
bulent velocity ﬁeld directly. In general,

103 (magenta cross) with the above relation and obtain C (cid:39)

be estimated as texc ∼ e/(de/dt) ∼ 2e2(R/H)2C−2Ω−1. We
can therefore predict the saturated eccentricity by equating

e ∼ C(H/R)(τs/2)1/2 .

For τs = 102 particles, this gives e ∼ 1.1(H/R) that matches
what we observe in Figure 6 very well. It also predicts a
saturation level of e ∼ 4.7(H/R) if we extend the simulation
for another ∼ 300Ω−1.

creasing τs > 1. The saturated values are e (cid:39) 0.7(H/R)
and 1.3(H/R) for τs = 10 and 102 particles (see Figure 7).
The eccentricity of τs = 103 particle keeps rising gradually
through the end of the simulation, suggesting that a sat-
uration level of (cid:38) 2(H/r) might be achieved for a longer
simulation which is consistent with previous simulations of
planetesimals in gravito-turbulent disks (Britsch et al. 2008;
Walmswell et al. 2013). We also ﬁnd that the particle ec-
centricity obtained in gravito-turbulent disk is in general
much greater than that could be excited in the MRI-driven
turbulent disk with similar turbulent stress-to-pressure ra-
tio α. The latter usually gives e ∼ 10−2–10−1(H/R)Q−1

After comparing with Equation 14, we ﬁnd the dimensionless

in MRI disks with similar α (e.g., γ ∼ 10−4 in Yang et al.

We also calculate the saturated eccentricity distribu-
tions of particles. In Figure 6, we ﬁnd that particles of all
types obey a Rayleigh-like distribution (Yang et al. 2009,
2012). The probability rises toward greater eccentricity, and
then drops at roughly the mean eccentricity measured in the
top panel of Figure 6. Particles having τs < 1 share nearly

(cid:38) cs as the τs increases from 10−3 to 103 which is indicated
by the increasing velocity dispersion or eccentricity as dis-
cussed in previous section. Exceptions occur at τs = 0.1−1,
where particles show the strongest clustering eﬀects (coher-
ent and therefore less relative motions in the ﬁlaments), the
relative velocity of the same type particles is largely reduced.
It even drops below 10−3cs for τs = 0.1 case. The general
approach of approximating particle relative velocity via the
measurement of velocity dispersion fails here. Our vrel and
rel for smaller particles (τs ≤ 0.1) seem similar to what are
v(cid:48)
found in MRI-driven turbulent disks (Carballido et al. 2010).
However, our vrel and v(cid:48)
rel increases with tstop for larger parti-
cles that have τs > 0.1, in contrast to MRI-driven turbulence
results (c.f. Figure 2 and 3 in Carballido et al. 2010) where
turbulent torquing due to the ﬂuctuating gravity ﬁeld of the
gas is not considered. The latter show vrel falls continuously,
and v(cid:48)
rel stays roughly constant with tstop, in agreement with
the theoretical prediction in isotropic turbulence (Ormel &
Cuzzi 2007). We will discuss the eﬀects of gravitational stir-
ring in section 3.5.
We also show the probability density functions (PDFs)
for vrel and v(cid:48)
rel in Figure 8. The PDFs of larger particles
(τs > 1) are similar to Maxwellian distribution (see the
dashed curve in the bottom right panel as an example of
Maxwellian distribution) (Windmark et al. 2012; Garaud
et al. 2013). Particles smaller than τs ∼ 1, however, show
broader distributions and smaller mean values than the big-
ger particles. They deviate signiﬁcantly from a Maxwellian
and resemble more of a log-normal distribution (Mitra et al.
2013; Pan et al. 2014). Relative velocities with respect to
the smallest particles, i.e., v(cid:48)
rel, have distributions that shift
gradually to higher values as the size of the larger particle
increases. Between τs = 0.01 and τs = 0.001 particles, the
largest relative velocities v(cid:48)
rel > 0.1cs, which might lead to
collisional destruction, are mostly due to their diﬀerent de-
celeration rates in post-shock regions (Nakamoto & Miura

eraged over all particles of the same type. The dashed line is

the same properties as gas. As τs increases above unity, in-
creasingly many particles obtain higher eccentricities owing
to stochastic gravitational forcing by gas. This behavior con-
trasts with that shown in Figure 6 of Gibbons et al. (2012),
in which the particle velocity distribution narrows as τs ex-
ceeds unity; their simulations omit gravitational stirring.

3.4 Relative velocity

The high eccentricities obtained in these particles indicate
large velocity dispersion, which leads to the question of what
is the relative velocity between pair collision. We thus mea-
sure the relative velocity of the same type particle or the
mono-disperse case vrel, and also the relative velocity with
respect to the smallest grains (τs = 10−3) or a bi-disperse
velocity v(cid:48)
rel, in each grid cell assuming there is no sub-
structure below this scale. The results are shown in Figure 8.
In general, the relative velocity (see the asterisk symbols

a diminished amplitude because there is signiﬁcant probability at vrel/(cid:104)cs(cid:105) < 10−4, which is oﬀ the scale of the plot. For comparison, a

the locations where v(cid:48)
rel > 0.1cs (white symbols) are found
just behind shock fronts, where gas radial velocities are dis-
continuous.

Relative velocities vrel between particles of the same
type can be separated into two groups. One group corre-
sponds to the small-size particles (τs ≤ 1), for which relative
velocities peak at vrel (cid:39) 0.01cs. The other group corresponds
to large-sized particles (τs > 1), for which peak velocities are
sonic. We note that τs = 0.1 (green squares) particles show
diminished amplitude and a signiﬁcant shift toward smaller
relative velocity due to the clustering eﬀect: ∼ 80% of contri-
bution from vrel/cs (cid:28) 10−4 is not shown in this plot. While
for τs = 1 particles, there is also a second, near sonic, con-
tribution, which shows the transitional behavior from small
size (friction-dominated) to large size (gravity-dominated)
particles.

3.5 Eﬀects of gravitational stirring

The gravitational stirring eﬀect has been studied in MRI-
driven turbulent disks and shown to induce high velocity
dispersion for solid bodies bigger than ∼ 100 m (or τs (cid:38) 103
at radius R ∼ AU) (Nelson & Gressel 2010; Yang et al. 2009,

2012; Okuzumi & Ormel 2013; Ormel & Okuzumi 2013). But
we will show the dominating gravitational forcing kicks in

α in gravito-turbulent disks (see
0.5α in MRI-driven turbulent

disks (Nelson & Gressel 2010; Yang et al. 2012).

As the stopping time increases, the ﬁrst term in Equa-
tion (8), the drag force, becomes less important compared
to the second term, the gravitational acceleration. Assuming
the characteristic length scale of the spiral density features
is l, then |∇Φ| ∼ Φ/l ∼ GδΣ, where δΣ ∼ Σ in our gravito-
turbulent disk is the density ﬂuctuation. The length scale
can be approximated with the most unstable wavelength for
axisymmetric disturbances, or simply the disk scaleheight,
l ∼ c2
s /GΣ ∼ Q2(GΣ/Ω2) ∼ H. This is also supported by
our simulations; the density waves have typical radial wave-

volume-averaged sound speed) at t = 200Ω−1. Large relative ve-
locities (> 0.1cs) between τs = 10−2 and 10−3 particles are over-

their diﬀerent stopping times (Nakamoto & Miura 2004; Jacquet
& Thompson 2014).

disks. However, for non-self-gravitating turbulent disks such
as MRI-driven turbulent disks, δΣ/Σ is one order of mag-
nitude smaller, and Q (cid:29) 1. As a results, the gravitational
stirring only aﬀect particles with τs > 10Q (cid:29) 1.

In top panel of Figure 10, we show the time variation of
radial positions of two representative particles in the stan-
dard simulation. The particle with larger τs = 103 oscillates
with a peak-to-peak amplitude of ∼ 40GΣ0/Ω2 at a fre-
quency of the orbital frequency Ω after it is released in the
turbulent disk. However, the small particle, τs = 10−3, scat-
ters randomly over time and does not show strong periodic
variations.

To reveal the self-gravity eﬀect to the dust dynamics,
we perform a rerun (tc=10.wosg) of the standard simulation
but suppress the gravitational forcing manually, i.e. remov-
ing −∇Φ term in Equation 8. The radially projected trajec-
tories of the same two representative particles are plotted in
the bottom panel of Figure 10 for comparison. Clearly, the
small particle is not aﬀected by the missing of gravitational
acceleration, and appears to behave similarly as in the stan-
dard run. However, the larger particle in tc=10.wosg barely
moves radially when the only acceleration/deceleration is
friction.

Without the gravitational stirring, the diﬀusion of par-
ticle also look signiﬁcantly diﬀerent than in Figure 4. In Fig-
ure 11, we present the diﬀusion coeﬃcients measured in run
tc=10.wosg using the same method as in Figure 4. Again,
the small tstop particles are unaﬀected and therefore give
nearly the same Dp,x as in the standard run. Dp,x of par-
ticles with τs > 1 drops rapidly as Dp,x ∝ (τs)−2 which
manifests the lack of gravitational forcing. We note the ex-
act relation between diﬀusion coeﬃcient and stopping time
slightly deviates from models of Cuzzi et al. (1993); Youdin
& Lithwick (2007). We speculate that is a result of diﬀerent

power spectra in gravito-turbulent disks than normal homo-
geneous turbulence model adopted in these models.

In Figure 11, we also compute the cumulative mass frac-
tion for run tc=10.wosg. As expected, the Ωtstop = 1 parti-
cles show the strongest concentration and more contribution
towards the higher concentration ((cid:38) 100) than the standard
tc=10 run. Both Ωtstop = 0.1 and Ωtstop = 10.0 show similar
secondary clustering but are much weaker than the concen-
tration of Ωtstop = 0.1 in the case where gravity is present.
Without the stochastic gravitational stirring, the av-
eraged particle eccentricity for all types of particles never
exceed e ∼ 0.3(H/R) as shown in Figure 7 (green squares).
The small particles (τs ≤ 1) have similar eccentricities as
in the standard run; however, those larger particles are dy-
namically unimportant, and e approaches nearly zero (ini-
tial value) as τs increases. The gravitational stirring is also
responsible for the increasing relative velocities for parti-
cles of τs ≥ 1. As shown in top row of Figure 8 in green
squares, instead of rising up, vrel decreases while v(cid:48)
rel stays
constant with increasing τs when gravitational forcing is not

values. For larger particle with a∗
i > 1, the eﬀective stopping
time is roughly ∼ 2a∗
After converting a∗ to the eﬀective stopping time, we
ﬁnd the results stay the same as the simulations using par-
ticles of constant stopping times. In Figure 12, we show the
diﬀusion coeﬃcient, particle eccentricity, and relative veloc-
ities in large colored symbols. They almost follow the results
using ﬁxed tstop (gray squares). Therefore, statistically, these
results validate the usage of ﬁxed tstop particles even in the
highly ﬂuctuated density ﬁeld of a gravito-turbulent disk.
In general, the results of ﬁxed tstop can approximate the
results of ﬁxed size particles. But this approach (constant
tstop) might underestimate the clustering eﬀect for the in-
termediate size particle τs = 1 as shown in Figure 13. This
also leads to an overestimate of the relative speed vrel for in-
termediate size particles of τs ∼ 1. The actual relative speed
for intermediate size particles would become even smaller
than what we have obtained.

Figure 11. Similar to Figure 4 and 3, we show radial diﬀusion
coeﬃcients (top panel) and cumulative fraction of dust mass (bot-
tom panel) for run tc=10.wosg, in which the gravitational forc-
ing from the gas is artiﬁcially removed. At larger stopping time,
the measured Dp,x without gravitational stirring are now closer
to models of Youdin & Lithwick (2007) (dashed gray curve) or
Cuzzi et al. (1993) (dotted). The clustering eﬀect for particles of
τs = 0.1 observed in Figure 3 is absent when gravitational stirring
is removed.

included, which is consistent with the results from previous
study (Ormel & Cuzzi 2007; Carballido et al. 2010).

3.6 Fixed particle size

In case that the ﬂuctuations of the density and sound speed
are large ((cid:46) O(1)), as is the case in gravito-turbulent disks,
the constant stopping time assumption for individual parti-
cles might not be valid as the particles would have varying
tstop as they travel around diﬀerent regions of the disk. We
therefore, in this section, test if our results still hold sta-
tistically when we ﬁx particle size instead of the stopping
time.
We set up seven types of particles with ﬁxed size, dimen-
sionless size a∗
i = 10i−4 for i = 1-7, as described in Equa-
tion (9) and section 2.2. Everything else is kept the same as
the standard run tc=10. For each type of particles, we de-
ﬁne an eﬀective stopping time (cid:104)(cid:104)tstop,i(cid:105)Σ(cid:105)t by ﬁrst measuring
the stopping time of individual particle according to Equa-

3.7 Eﬀects of cooling time

The dust dynamics would also be aﬀected by the strength
of the turbulence. In a gravito-turblent disk, the strength of
the turbulence, e.g., in term of α, is inversely proportional
to the cooling time (Gammie 2001; Shi & Chiang 2014). We
can therefore study how the dust dynamics changes with the
turbulent strength by varying tcool.

We perform simulations with tcoolΩ = 5 (run tc=5),
20 (run tc=20), and 40 (run tc=40) using the same par-
ticle distribution as in the tcoolΩ = 10 standard run. We
then measure the diﬀusion coeﬃcient in each tcool case and
present the results in Figure 14. We ﬁnd Dp,x of various cool-
ing time share rather similar proﬁle. It is ﬂat at τs < 0.1 end
when aerodynamical coupling is strong. Dp,x traces Dg,x in
this regime, and the Schmidt number, which measures the
ratio of angular momentum transport and mass diﬀusion,
Sc ≡ αc2
s Ω−1/Dg,x ∼ 1.4–2.4, stays roughly constant. The
diﬀusion coeﬃcient rises up for 0.1 ≤ τs ≤ 1, indicating
the increasing eﬀect of the gravitational stirring. In the very
long stopping time regime, τs ≥ 10, the proﬁle levels oﬀ
again as the dominant gravitational acceleration does not
depend on tstop. The magnitude of Dp,x is usually 5–9 times
of the diﬀusion of small particle or gas. For given particle
size, we ﬁnd Dp,x scales roughly as ∝ 1/tcool which indicates
stronger diﬀusion in stronger turbulence.

Varying the cooling time also aﬀects the particle con-
centration. In Figure 15, we show the density snapshots of
simulations using diﬀerent cooling times at the top row. As
tcool gets longer, we ﬁnd the turbulent amplitude diminishes,
so does the tilt angle of the shearing wave features. This
leads to less frequent interactions between separated shear-
ing waves and longer life time for existing density features.
In the bottom row of Figure 15, we ﬁnd strong interactions
of shearing waves in Ωtcool = 5 run leads to plume-like struc-

100. The concentration is greater, (cid:38) 100−103 for Ωtcool = 40
case, and particles are more spatially conﬁned in very nar-
row streams. In Figure 16, we quantitatively conﬁrm this
result by showing the cumulative mass fraction of the τs = 1
particles for various cooling times. As tcool rises, more and
more mass actually concentrate towards larger dust density,
although the density dispersion of gas decreases.

The particle relative velocity and eccentricity drops as
the cooling time gets longer (see Figure 14). In general, from
Ωtcool = 10 to 40, vrel, v(cid:48)

velocity/density dispersion scales. Exceptions occur at the

and 1, where we ﬁnd the relative velocity of the same kind
vrel drops rapidly with increasing cooling time. It diminishes
∼ 30 times from Ωtcool = 5 to 40 for τs = 0.1 particles and
(cid:46) 103 times for particles with τs = 1. As the intermediate-
sized particles show the strongest clustering, the rather slow
relative velocity would favor gravitational collapsing.
Based on our results in Table 1, the density disper-
sion usually follows δΣ/Σ (cid:39) 2(Ωtcool)−1/2 (cid:39) 5α1/2 in
gravito-turbulent disks. As already mentioned in section 3.5,
this is much stronger ﬂuctuation than found in MRI disks
(∼(cid:46) α1/2). Similar as in section 3.3, we also measure the

MNRAS 000, 1–19 (2016)

dimensionless turbulent strength γ based on the eccentric-
ity growth for diﬀerent tcool runs and list them in Table 1.
The strength parameter γ (cid:39) 0.07α1/2 seems about one or-
der of magnitude greater than those found in MRI-driven
turbulent disks (Nelson & Gressel 2010; Yang et al. 2012)
which also explains why we observe much larger eccentricity
and relative speed for large particles (τs > 1) in our gravito-
turbulent disks.

3.8 Domain size and resolution eﬀects

In this section, we investigate if our results are aﬀected by
the size of the computational domain we adopt. By dou-
bling the size of the shearing sheet and meanwhile keeping
the numerical resolution the same, run tc=10.dble quadru-
ples the numbers of grid cells and dust particles. Following
the discussion in section 2.2, we ﬁrst start with a pure gas
simulation with Ωtcool = 10 using now an extended domain.
This simulation runs for ∼ 200Ω−1 and quasi-steady gravito-
turbulent stage is conﬁrmed after (cid:46) 20Ω−1. We then inject
the particles at t = 50Ω−1 similar to our standard run, and
rerun for another 200Ω−1 with now both gas and particles
on the grids. The results are summarized in Table 1 (for the
gas) and 2 (for the dust diﬀusion).

Figure 13. How particles concentrate in a run with ﬁxed stopping
time τs = 1 (from run tc=10) versus a run with ﬁxed particle size
a∗ = 1 (from run tc=10.size). The latter case, having an eﬀective
τs (cid:39) 0.83, shows stronger concentration.

We ﬁnd the gas properties of tc=10.dble, do not devi-
ate much from those of the standard run tc=10. The diﬀu-
sion coeﬃcients for diﬀerent type of dust particles are also
very similar, ∼ 20% of diﬀerence at most. No signiﬁcant
variations are observed comparing the particle eccentric-
ity/relative velocities between the standard (black asterisk)
and the double-sized (cyan triangles) simulations in Figure 7
and 8 either. We ﬁnd similar clustering for the intermediate
size particles as well. All these suggest converging results are
obtained by adopting domain size of our standard run.

In another run tc=10.hires, we double the number of
grid cells in x and y directions and quadruple the total
numbers of particles for each species to study the eﬀects
of numerical resolution. The gas properties and the radial
diﬀusion coeﬃcients in this higher resolution run are listed
in Table 2. We ﬁnd doubling the resolution would slightly
increase αtot and Dp,x by (cid:46) 20%. The particle eccentricity
and relative velocities (see red diamond symbols in Figure 7
and top two panels of Figure 8) are also very similar to those
from the standard run. We therefore conﬁrm good numerical
convergence in our results.

4 DISCUSSION

In this section, we try to construct a model of gravito-
turbulent disk, and convert our scale free results in previ-
ous sections into a more physical and realistic format. An
optically thin turbulent ﬂow driven by gravity of its own
can be easily found on the outskirts of protoplanetary disks.
At an orbital distance of R ∼ 100AU from a solar-mass
star, a disk mass of ΣR2 ∼ 0.01M(cid:12) or surface density of
Σ ∼ 10g cm−2, and a temperature of T ∼ 10K would lead
to a Toomre Q about unity and a cooling time scale much
longer than the local dynamical time. Depending on the dust
opacity of the disk, the cooling time can vary from several
times to orders of magnitude longer than the local Ω−1 (Shi
& Chiang 2014). In this disk, H/R ∼ 0.1 and gas density
ρg ∼ Σ/H ∼ 10−13g cm−3.

4.1 Particle sizes
The mean free path of the gas at radius R ∼ 100AU is
λ ∼ 104cm, which is typically much greater than the dust
particle size we have simulated. Therefore the particle’s stop-
ping time can be characterized as

using the Epstein’s law, where s is the physical size of the
dust particle. Speciﬁcally in our simulations, particles with
τs = 10−3 would be translated to 0.1 mm in particle size,
and τs = 103 corresponds to 0.1 km planetesimals.

For particles even smaller than 0.1 mm, they are per-
fectly coupled with gas, and will behave very similarly as
the sub-mm-sized particles we explored using our simula-
tions. For planetesimals even bigger than 0.1 km in size, the
stopping time starts to depend on the relative velocity be-
tween the dust and gas. However, similar to Equation 17, we
can show that in the Stokes regime, the gravitational stir-
ring always dominates the gas drag in our gravito-turbulent
disk. The general empirical formula for the drag force reads

in our gravito-turbulent disk described above (Cheng 2009;
Perets & Murray-Clay 2011). The ratio between the speciﬁc
drag force and the gravitational acceleration is therefore

imals is mostly determined by the gravity of the gas in
gravito-turbulent disks. Therefore, our results for τs = 103,
or s = 0.1 km, particles could be easily extrapolated to even
bigger planetesimals.

4.2 Implications

4.2.1 Fast mass transport via turbulent diﬀusion

Radial diﬀusion due to turbulent and gravitational stirring
can contribute to the mass transport of the solids. The time
for particles across a radial distance ∆R solely due to the
diﬀusion process is tdiﬀ ∼ ∆R2/Dp,x. If we take Ωtcool =
10 run as an example, tdiﬀ ∼ 105 (∆R/10AU)2 yr for cm
or smaller particles (τs < 1) or ∼ 104 (∆R/10AU)2 yr for
particles of 10 cm or bigger (τs ≥ 1). Both suggests the radial
diﬀusion in gravito-turbulent disks might play a role in the
radial transport of the solids. For comparison, the drift time

in which we put back in the cooling time dependence of
the diﬀusion coeﬃcient (see section 3.7) as Dp,x ∝ α ∝
(Ωtcool)−1 roughly. The radial transport due to turbulent
diﬀusion and gravitational stirring really becomes compara-
ble to the radial drift eﬀect especially for the large particles
with τs ≥ 1. Outward diﬀusive transport counters, to some
extent, inward drift of large particles and partially allevi-
ates the radial drift barrier problem (Weidenschilling 1977;
Boss 2015). In Figure 17, we show this eﬀect for particles
with τs = 1 — those that drift fastest — using a diﬀusion
s Ω−1. We evolve a narrow Gaussian
coeﬃcient Dp,x = 0.1c2
distribution of particles at 100 AU for 105 years by solving
the Fokker-Planck equation, including both radial drift and
turbulent diﬀusion (Adams & Bloch 2009). The ﬁnite vol-
ume algorithm FiPy (Guyer et al. 2009) is used to solve the
partial diﬀerential equation.4 About 10% of the original set

of particles (black solid curve in Figure 17) can still be found
at R = 100 AU; by contrast, if radial diﬀusion is turned oﬀ
(green dashed curve), practically none remain at the origi-
nal location. On the other hand, as we discuss in the next
section, inward diﬀusion might also help particles move out
of turbulent regions and avoid disruption induced by grav-
itational torques. It is clear that radial diﬀusion of dust in
gravito-turbulent disks is signiﬁcant.

4.2.2 Fragmentation and run-away accretion barriers

Large relative velocity between particle pairs might lead to
catastrophic disruptions. For micron-to-meter-sized parti-
cles, the critical collisional speeds which would results in
fragmentation is vf (cid:38) 1 m s−1 (Blum & Wurm 2008; Stewart
& Leinhardt 2009; Carballido et al. 2010), which is (cid:38) 0.01cs
in our disk. Based on the probability distribution function
of relative velocity for the equal-sized particles (bottom left
panel of Figure 8), particles of decimeter or smaller (τs ≤ 1)
are mostly below this fragmentation barrier.

As particle grows even bigger, its self-gravity would
strengthen the particle against catastrophic disruption. The
criteria of fragmentation is such that the speciﬁc kinetic en-
ergy of a collision (v2
rel/2) exceeds the critical disruption

density becomes weaker, the tilt angle of shearing waves also gets smaller, both indicates relatively weaker angular momentum transport
as the cooling time scale gets longer. However, stronger clustering eﬀects are found for longer cooling cases as the velocity dispersion
from the gas gets weaker.

ity could all cause diﬀerences in this criteria (Stewart &
Leinhardt 2009). Therefore, we should take the above en-
ergy criteria as a rough order-of-magnitude estimation.

Thus particles with m ≤ s ≤ km (10 ≤ τs ≤ 104) would have
fragmentation velocity ∼ (0.01−0.1)cs, much lower than the
most probable relative velocity of those particles found in
our simulations (see again the bottom left panel of Figure 8).

disks would therefore limit the size that the majority of plan-
etesimal formation could reach.

If the main channel of planetesimal formation is through
gravitational run-away accretion, it would require the rela-
tive velocity to be even lower than the escape velocity of
the collisional outcome (Ida et al. 2008; Okuzumi & Ormel
2013; Ormel & Okuzumi 2013),

(23)
The planetesimal formation from collisional accretion is
strongly disfavored in our gravito-turbulent disks.

There are a few conditions that might allay the diﬃcul-
ties: (1) When taking into account of tcool, a longer cooling
time scale would reduce the relative velocity (only weakly de-
pends on tcool though; see Figure 14) and thus lower the pos-
sibility of fragmentation. (2) We note the distribution func-
tions show a sizeable spread toward smaller relative velocity,
therefor a small fraction of planetesimals might still survive
the collision or even accrete although the mean relative ve-
locity is high (Windmark et al. 2012). (3) The strong diﬀu-
sion may bring planetesimals outside the gravito-turbulent
zone, and proceed further growth in a less violent environ-
ment. (4) If the pre-existing sizes of the planetesimals are big
enough, they might avoid fragmentation and/or run-away
barrier since vrel scales with τs diﬀerently than vesc and vf
do. We ﬁnd vrel/cs (cid:39) (τs/10)0.16 after extrapolating our rel-
ative speed results in the bottom left panel of Figure 14 to-
ward high τs end. We thus ﬁnd only planetesimals (cid:38) 100 km
could pass the fragmentation barrier; only (cid:38) 1000 km-sized
planetesimals would result in collisional accretion. Such large
planetesimals might form via gravitational instability as we
will discuss next.

4.2.3 Gravitational collapse

Despite the problems caused by the big relative velocity for
particles bigger than meter-size, those cm-to-decimeter-sized
(τs = 0.1−1) pebbles, ﬁnd themselves mostly in very dense
coherent structures and possessing very low relative veloci-
ties. As shown in Figure 2 and 15, the concentration factor
Σp/(cid:104)Σp(cid:105) is typically (cid:38) 10-100 in those ﬁlament-like struc-
tures. Concentrations can go even higher than (cid:38) 100-103
times the original particle density for longer cooling time
tcool = 40Ω−1. This density enhancement of the dust par-
ticles would push the dust-to-gas ratio from ∼ 1/100 to
Σp/Σg (cid:38) 10. More importantly, the resulting local dust den-
sity

2013). In Figure 18, we show a clump of τs = 1 particles

which possess over-density Σp/(cid:104)Σp(cid:105) (cid:38) 103 could survive for
(cid:39) 6 orbits, or 6, 000yr at R = 100 AU, before getting dis-
rupted in a gravito-turbulent disk with Ωtcool = 40. This
is signiﬁcantly longer than the dynamical time that is nec-
essary for the process of gravitational collapse. Even if the
dust density does not cross the Roche density, the ρp ∼ ρg
in our gravito-turbulent disks could still trigger other in-
stabilities such as streaming instability (Goodman & Pin-
dor 2000; Youdin & Goodman 2005) for those intermediate
size particles. As a result, the dust density increases further
and graviational collapse would still occur eventually. The
resulting planetesimals would then diﬀuse out the gravito-
turbulent region as discussed in section 4.2.1 and avoid being
destroyed (if s (cid:46) 100 km) due to collision with planetesimals
of the same size.

4.2.4 Comparison with MRI-driven turbulent disks

In general, we ﬁnd relatively stronger radial diﬀusion and
eccentricity growth in our gravito-turbulent disks than in
MRI-driven turbulent disks of similar α.

According to Yang et al. (2009, 2012), the standard de-

viation of radial drift can be described as

Take our standard tc=10 run (α (cid:39) 0.02) as an example,

obtain a dimensionless Cx ≥ 0.038, more than one order
of magnitude larger than Cx measured in MRI disks (cf.
Table 1 in Nelson & Gressel (2010) and Table 2 in Yang
et al. (2012)).

The excitation of eccentricity can also be described as

where Ce is a dimensionless coeﬃcient characterizes the

Ce (cid:39) 0.040 QC .

(29)
Recalling C (cid:39) 0.15 for τs = 102 when Ωtcool = 10 in sec-
tion 3.3, we ﬁnd the typical Ce (cid:39) 0.018, much greater than
10−3–10−4 found in Yang et al. (2012) using local shearing
boxes, and one order of magnitude greater than reported in
Nelson & Gressel (2010) with global simulations.

The increasing eccentricity and diﬀusion is a result of
stronger gravitational forcing in gravito-turbulent disk than
in MRI disk. Quantitatively, the parameter γ (closely related
to δΣ/Σ) reﬂects the strength of this stirring. As discussed
in section 3.7 and also shown in Table 1, this dimensionless
parameter γ is at least one order of magnitude larger than
found in MRI disks (e.g., Yang et al. 2012). As discussed in
section 3.5, the stronger forcing also pushes more types of
particles (τs > 1) into the gravity dominated regime; while

in number) with τs = 1 are marked as black dots, and the color contour at the background shows the density ﬂuctuation in linear scale.
We ﬁrst identify a high density (Σp (cid:38) 1000) particle cluster at t = 48Ω−1, as show in the second panel with black dots. We then track
each individual particles backward/forward in time. The compact cluster disappears only after t = 84Ω−1, which lasts nearly 6 orbits
before being sheared away.

in MRI disk, as shown in Figure 15 and 23 of Nelson &
Gressel (2010), this occurs only for particles with τs > 100.

5 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

We have studied the dynamics of dust in gravito-turbulent
disks, i.e., gaseous disks whose turbulence is driven by self-
gravity, using 2D hybrid (particle and gas) simulations in a
local shearing sheet approximation. For dust particles, we
included the aerodynamic drag and gravitational pull from
self-gravitating gas, and neglected particle self-gravity and
feedback. We obtained the density distribution, radial diﬀu-
sion coeﬃcient and relative velocities for dust particles with
stopping times distributed from 10−3Ω−1 to 103Ω−1. We
summarize our main results as follows:

(i) Particles with small stopping times (τs < 0.1) are
aerodynamically well-coupled to gas and therefore trace
the gas distribution. Diﬀusion coeﬃcients for small par-
ticles are close to those for gas. The gas diﬀusion coef-
ﬁcient Dg,x is related to the angular momentum trans-
port parameter α via a roughly constant Schmidt number
Sc = α/Dg,x = 1.4−2.4. Small particles also have low eccen-
tricities (e ∼ 0.1(H/R)(α/0.01)1/2) and low relative veloci-
ties ((cid:46) 0.01−0.1 (α/0.01)1/2cs).
(ii) Particles with larger stopping times (τs (cid:38) 1) are more
strongly gravitationally forced from self-gravitating gas than
by aerodynamic drag. The stronger forcing results in diﬀu-
sion coeﬃcients that are (cid:38) 5 times greater than those of
smaller particles. Turbulent diﬀusion in gravito-turbulent
disks therefore plays an important role in radial trans-
port of large bodies. Strong stochastic gravitational stirring
generates large eccentricities (e (cid:38) 0.5−1(H/R)(α/0.01)1/2)
and large relative velocity ((cid:38) (α/0.01)1/2cs). These disfavor
planetesimal formation by pairwise collision as the typical
collisional speed exceeds both the escape and fragmentation
velocities.
intermediate size (τs = 0.1−1) are
marginally coupled to gas, and are collected by both gas drag
and gravitational torques (see equation 17) into ﬁlament-
like structures having large overdensities ((cid:38) 10−103 times
the background) and low relative velocities ((cid:46) 0.01cs) be-
tween like-sized particles. The density concentration is high

enough to trigger direct gravitational collapse. Nascent plan-
etesimals can avoid collisional disruption by diﬀusing to less
turbulent regions of the disk.
(iv) Longer cooling times result in weaker turbulence
(α ∝ (Ωtcool)−1), weaker particle diﬀusion (∝ α), lower
relative velocities and eccentricities (∝ √
α), and stronger
clustering for intermediate-size (τs = 0.1−1) particles.

(v) Compared to MRI-turbulent disks, gravito-turbulent
√
disks show almost one order-of-magnitude stronger density
ﬂuctuations for similar α (δΣ/Σ (cid:39) 5
0.5α).
Stronger gravitational stirring leads to higher eccentricities
and relative velocities between particles.

√

In a recent paper that parallels ours, Booth & Clarke
(2016) study the relative velocities of dust particles in
global smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations
of gravito-turbulent protoplanetary disks. Like us, they ﬁnd
large relative velocities for particles with τs (cid:38) 3 (compare
our Figure 8 with their Figures 6 and 7).

Future investigations could improve upon our work in
any number of ways. As we use massless test particles in
2D hydrodynamic local simulations with a simplistic cooling
prescription, the eﬀects of vertical sedimentation, particle
feedback, particle self-gravity (Gibbons et al. 2014), and self-
consistent heating and cooling on dust dynamics could be
further explored. Local and eventually global 3D simulations
which account for these physical eﬀects would be clear next
steps.
