HÖLDER CONTINUITY OF OSELEDETS SPLITTINGS FOR

SEMI-INVERTIBLE OPERATOR COCYCLES

DAVOR DRAGIČEVIĆ AND GARY FROYLAND

Abstract. For Hölder continuous cocycles over an invertible, Lipschitz base, we es-
tablish the Hölder continuity of Oseledets subspaces on compact sets of arbitrarily large
measure. This extends a result of Araújo, Bufetov, and Filip [2] by considering possibly
noninvertible cocycles, which in addition may take values in the space of compact opera-
tors on a Hilbert space. As a by-product of our work, we also show that a noninvertible
cocycle with nonvanishing Lyapunov exponents exhibits nonuniformly hyperbolic be-
haviour (in the sense of Pesin) on a set of full measure.

1. Introduction

The celebrated Oseledets multiplicative ergodic theorem (MET) [18] plays a funda-
mental role in the modern theory of dynamical systems. At an abstract level, the MET
generalises the notion of eigenvalues and eigenvectors for a single matrix A ∈ Rd×d to
concatenations of matrices A(f n−1x) · · · A(f (x))A(x), where A : X → Rd×d is an invert-
ible matrix-valued function on a probability space (X, B, µ), and f : X (cid:9). Under some
technical assumptions, the MET guarantees the existence of a ﬁnite set of numbers (called
Lyapunov exponents) and subspaces of Rd (called Oseledets subspaces) which either form
a decomposition or a ﬁltration of Rd (depending on whether f is invertible or not) such
that Lyapunov exponents describe the asymptotic growth of vectors which belong to
Oseledets subspaces under the action of A.

Arguably the most important applications of this result are in the area of smooth
dynamics. For example, the proof of MET initiated the study of nonuniformly hyper-
bolic dynamical systems; that is, systems with nonzero Lyapunov exponents with respect
to some smooth invariant probability measure. Since the landmark works of Pesin in
1970s, the theory of nonuniform hyperbolicity emerged as an independent, rich and ac-
tive discipline lying at the heart of dynamical systems theory. Among the most important
consequences of nonuniform hyperbolicity is the existence of stable invariant manifolds
and their absolute continuity property (see [19]). The theory also describes the ergodic
properties of a dynamical system with a ﬁnite invariant measure that is absolutely contin-
uous with respect to the volume, and it expresses the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy in terms
of the Lyapunov exponents by Pesin’s entropy formula (see [19]). Furthermore, combining
the nonuniform hyperbolicity with the nontrivial recurrence guaranteed by the existence
of a ﬁnite invariant measure, the work of Katok [15] revealed a rich and complicated
orbit structure, including an exponential growth rate for the number of periodic points
measured in terms of the topological entropy, and the approximation of the entropy of
an invariant measure by uniformly hyperbolic horseshoes. More recently, Barreira, Pesin
and Schmeling [6] discovered a striking relation between this theory and a dimension

We refer to [5] for further references and a detailed exposition of this theory.

Oseledets’ MET has not only been reproved in many diﬀerent ways, it has also been
generalised several times, including to compact operators on Hilbert spaces by Ruelle [20],
to compact operators on Banach spaces with some continuity conditions on the base f and
the dependence of the operators on x ∈ X by Mañé [17], to quasi-compact operators on
possibly non-separable Banach spaces with continuity conditions by Thieullen [21], and to
quasi-compact operators on separable Banach spaces with weaker continuity conditions
by Lian and Lu [16]. Prior to the publication of [11], all previous work considered the
MET in one (or both) of two ﬂavours: either there is no invertibility assumption on
the base and the linear actions, and one obtains the existence of an equivarient ﬂag or
ﬁltration; or there is an invertibility assumption on both the base and the linear actions,
and one obtains the much stronger outcome of existence of an equivariant splitting.

Froyland, Lloyd, and Quas [11] extended the classical Oseledets multiplicative ergodic
theorem by proving that if the base is invertible, a unique Oseledets splitting exists even
when the matrices are not necessarily invertible.

Theorem 1 ([11]). Let f : X (cid:9) preserve an ergodic Borel probability measure µ and
assume that A : X → Rd×d satisﬁes

Then there exist numbers

and for µ-a.e. x ∈ M a measurable decomposition

Semi-invertible versions of the Oseledets theorem for quasi-compact operator cocycles
were developed in [12] and [14], generalising the results of [21] and [16], respectively. The
numbers in (2) are called Lyapunov exponents and we will refer to the splitting in (3) as
to the Oseledets splitting. Furthermore, we will say that Ei(x) is the Oseledets subspace
that corresponds to a Lyapunov exponent λi.

It is well-known that in general, in all the above mentioned generalizations of MET, the
Oseledets subspaces depend only measurably on base points. However, it was recently
proved by Araújo, Bufetov and Filip [2] that under the assumptions that f : X (cid:9) is a
Lipschitz and that A : X → GL(d, R) is Hölder continuous, one is able to establish Hölder
continuity of the Oseledets subspaces on compact sets of arbitrarily large measure. The
arguments in [2] build on a previous work of Brin [8] who proved (in a particular case of
derivative cocycles) that for Anosov systems, the stable and unstable distributions depend
Hölder continuosly everywhere and that the same happens for nonuniformly hyperbolic
systems but on a compact set of arbitrarily large measure.

The main objective of this paper is to extend the results from [2] by considering possi-
bly noninvertible cocycles, as well as compact operator cocycles with values in the space
of all bounded linear operators acting on some Hilbert space. In order to describe our

2

main result in a ﬁnite-dimensional case, assume that A : X → Rd×d is a Hölder continu-
ous cocycle over an invertible Lipschitz transformation f : X (cid:9) satisfying (1). We prove
that the Oseledets subspaces in Theorem 1 are Hölder continuous on compact sets of
arbitrarily large measure. We emphasize that the lack of the invertibility causes substan-
tial complications and that consequently crucial parts of our argument diﬀer from the
approach developed in [2]. In addition, this new setting requires new proofs of versions
of some well-known facts from Pesin theory. For example, Theorem 2 establishes upper
and lower bounds for the growth of the cocycles when restricted to the subbundles E(x)
and F (x) given by

E(x) = E1(x) ⊕ . . . ⊕ Ei(x)

and F (x) = Ei+1 ⊕ . . . ⊕ Ek(x),

as well as a lower bound on the angle between E(x) and F (x). This result plays an
important role in our arguments but is also of independent interest since it in particular
implies that if all Lyapunov exponents are nonzero then the cocycle exhibits a nonuni-
formly hyperbolic behaviour on a set of full measure. To the best of our knowledge this
result had not yet been established before for semi-invertible cocycles.

We emphasize that semi-invertible cocycles arise in two very important situations from
the point of view of applications. Firstly, the study of Markov chains in a random en-
vironment (MCRNs). Markov chains form the basis of mathematical models for a huge
variety of physical, chemical, and biological phenomena, including problems in statistical
mechanics, (bio)chemical engineering, epidemic modelling, complex networks, and genet-
ics. More typically than not, the underlying transition probabilities in the Markov chain
model evolve over time according to some external random or time-dependent environ-
ment. Instead of having a single invariant probability measure for a stationary Markov
chain, Markov chains in random environments possess a family of (random) invariant
measures (see e.g. [9]), which depend on the environment. In the language of Oseledets’
MET, X is the environment, f : X (cid:9) describes the evolution of the random environment,
and A : X → Rd×d is a stochastic matrix-valued function. The family of random invariant
measures are the top Oseledets spaces, corresponding to the leading Lyapunov exponent
λk = 0. The stability of these random invariant measures has been explored in [10], where
it is shown that under mild assumptions on perturbations to f or A the random invariant
measure is continuous in probability with respect to the environment. Theorem 5 in the
present work will show that if f is Lipschitz and x 7→ A(x) is Hölder continuous, then the
random invariant measure depends Hölder continuously on the environment conﬁgura-
tion x ∈ X on compact sets of arbitrarily large measure. These assumptions on f and A
are very reasonable for mathematical models of real-world processes and our result pro-
vides the assurance that on the vast bulk of the environment space, the time-asymptotic
distribution of trajectories of the MCRN varies continuously with the environment.

A second application, which was the motivation for the work [11], concerns a program
to understand time-dependent dynamical systems through transfer operator cocycles.
One begins with a function x 7→ Tx, where each Tx : M (cid:9) is a nonlinear map on
a smooth Riemannian manifold M. A map cocycle Tf n−1x ◦ · · · ◦ Tf x ◦ Tx represents
the time-dependent evolution of a nonlinear dynamical system. For example, let M be
a three-dimensional manifold representing the ocean, X be the internal conﬁguration
of the ocean (e.g. the distribution of pressure gradients), f describe how the internal
conﬁguration changes over one day, and Tx describe the motion of water particles over
one day given the current conﬁguration is x. Associated with each Tx is a linear operator
(the transfer operator, see e.g. [4] for deﬁnitions) Lx : B (cid:9), acting on a suitable Banach
space B. Continuing with our ocean example, if g(z) : M → R describes the distribution

3

of some inert, neutrally buoyant chemical in the ocean at “time” x ∈ X, then (Lxg)(z) is
the distribution of the chemical one day later. That is, the transfer operators {Lx}x∈X
transform densities in B to densities in B just as the maps {Tx}x∈X transform points in
M to points in M.

In many areas of nonlinear dynamics, including ﬂuid dynamics and models of geophys-
ical ﬂow such as the ocean and atmosphere, one is interested in structures that decay to
equilibrium very slowly; so-called Lagrangian coherent structures or coherent sets. In ﬂuid
dynamics, these represent parts of the ﬂuid that are slow to mix with the rest of the ﬂuid;
in the ocean and atmosphere, these structures have physical manifestations as gyres and
eddies, and vortices, respectively. It turns out that the second largest Lyapunov exponent
(the ﬁrst nontrivial exponent after λk = 0) describes the time-asymptotic decay rate of
the family of most slowly decaying signed distributions {gx(z)}x∈X . Furthermore, and
crucially for applications, these signed distributions are given by the corresponding 2nd
Oseledets spaces; see [11, 13] for details. In numerical experiments, the transfer operators
Lx are represented as large stochastic matrices on computers, and the Oseledets spaces
are similarly discretised. Theorem 5 in the present paper states that if f is Lipschitz and
the linear actions are Hölder continuous, then the corresponding Oseledets spaces, which
describe the coherent structures, are Hölder continuous functions on subsets of the base
space X of arbitrarily large measure. This establishes the important fact that in applica-
tions, dramatic changes in coherent structures as a function of the driving conﬁguration
are extremely rare.

2. Semi-invertible cocycles and nonuniform hyperbolicity

In order to make our arguments more transparent and easier to follow, our presentation
is for ﬁnite-dimension cocycles. In the ﬁnal section we highlight the changes necessary to
deal with the inﬁnite-dimensional setting. A measurable map A : X × N0 → Rd×d, where
N0 = {0, 1, 2, . . .} is said to be a cocycle over f if:

1. A(x, 0) = Id for every x ∈ X;
2. A(x, n + m) = A(f n(x), m)A(x, n) for every x ∈ X and n, m ≥ 0.

A map A : X → Rd×d deﬁned by A(x) = A(x, 1), x ∈ X is called a generator of a cocycle
A. For an f -invariant set Λ ⊂ X, a family of subspaces E(x) ⊂ Rd, x ∈ Λ is called
A-invariant if A(x)E(x) ⊂ E(f x) for each x ∈ Λ.

We will now establish several auxiliary results related to Theorem 1 that will be used

throughout the paper. We start with the following lemma.

Lemma 1. Assume that Λ is an f -invariant set and let E(x) ⊂ Rd and F (x) ⊂ Rd,
x ∈ Λ be A-invariant families of subspaces with the property that there exist λ1 < λ2,
ε > 0 and measurable functions C, ˜C : Λ → (0, ∞) such that

1.

2. E(x) ∩ F (x) = {0} for x ∈ Λ;
3. for x ∈ Λ, v ∈ E(x) ⊕ F (x) and n ≥ 0,

λ1 + 3ε ≤ λ2 − 2ε;

kA(x, n)vk ≤ ˜C(x)e(λ2+ε)nkvk;

4. for x ∈ Λ, v ∈ F (x) and n ≥ 0,

kA(x, n)vk ≥

kA(x, n)vk ≤ C(x)e(λ1+ε)nkvk;

6. for x ∈ Λ and m ∈ Z,

˜C(f m(x)) ≤ ˜C(x)eε|m|

and C(f m(x)) ≤ C(x)eε|m|.

Then, there exists a measurable function K : Λ → (0, ∞) satisfying

K(f m(x)) ≤ K(x)e5ε|m|,

for x ∈ Λ and m ∈ Z

and such that

kv1k ≤ K(x)kv1 + v2k

and kv2k ≤ K(x)kv1 + v2k,

for v1 ∈ E(x) and v2 ∈ F (x).

(11)

(12)

Proof. Let P (x) : E(x) ⊕ F (x) → E(x) and Q(x) : E(x) ⊕ F (x) → F (x) be projections.
Set

γ(x) = inf{kv1 + v2k : v1 ∈ E(x), v2 ∈ F (x), kv1k = kv2k = 1}.
For any v ∈ E(x) ⊕ F (x) such that P (x)v 6= 0 and Q(x)v 6= 0, we have that

γ(x) ≤ (cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)

Hence,

kP (x)vk ≤

γ(x)

We note that the above inequality is trivially satisﬁed when P (x)v = 0. Finally, if
Q(x)v = 0 then P (x)v = v and we conclude that

kP (x)k ≤ max{1, 2/γ(x)},

for x ∈ Λ.

(13)

Similarly,

(14)
Take now arbitrary v1 ∈ E(x) and v2 ∈ F (x) such that kv1k = kv2k = 1. By (7), (8)

kQ(x)k ≤ max{1, 2/γ(x)},

for x ∈ Λ.

and (9) we have that

e(λ2−ε)n(x) − C(x)e(λ1+ε)n(x) ≥

C(x)

e(λ2−2ε)n(x)

or equivalently

e(λ2−ε)n(x) − C(x)2e(λ1+ε)n(x) ≥ e(λ2−2ε)n(x).

and thus

C(x)

e(λ2−2ε)n(x)

2

γ(x)

≤ 2C(x) ˜C(x)e3εn(x).

(18)

Finally, we claim that that n(f m(x)) ≤ n(x) + |m| for each x ∈ Λ and m ∈ Z. Indeed,
using (6) and (10), we have that

e(λ2−ε)(n(x)+|m|) − C(f m(x))2e(λ1+ε)(n(x)+|m|)

≥ e(λ2−ε)n(x) · e(λ2−ε)|m| − C(x)2e(λ1+ε)n(x) · e(λ1+3ε)|m|
≥ e(λ2−ε)n(x) · e(λ2−ε)|m| − C(x)2e(λ1+ε)n(x) · e(λ2−2ε)|m|
≥ e(λ2−2ε)n(x) · e(λ2−2ε)|m|
≥ e(λ2−2ε)(n(x)+|m|).

by (17)

In order to complete the proof of the lemma, we are going to show that the function
K(x) = max{1, 2C(x) ˜C(x)e3εn(x)} satisﬁes (11) and (12). We note that (12) follows
directly from (13), (14) and (18). Moreover, using (10), we have that

C(f m(x)) ˜C(f m(x))e3εn(f m(x)) ≤ C(x) ˜C(x)e3εn(x) · e5ε|m|,

for each x ∈ Λ and m ∈ Z, which readily implies that (11) holds.

(cid:3)

Suppose that the Lyapunov exponents of the cocycle A are given by (2). Then, for

each i ∈ {1, . . . , k}, we can associate to (3) a new decomposition of Rd as

Rd = (cid:18)Mj≤i

Ej(x)(cid:19) ⊕(cid:18)Mj>i

Ej(x)(cid:19).

(19)

The following result establishes exponential bounds for A along the two subspaces forming
the decomposition (19) as well as for angles between them. For invertible cocycles such a
result is well-known (see Theorem 3.3.1 in [5] for example). A major diﬃculty in adapting
the arguments in [5] is that they rely heavily on the well-known fact that the angles
between Oseledets subspaces in the standard (invertible) MET exhibit a subexponential
growth along each trajectory. On the other hand, to the best of our knowledge no
such statement was established in relation to the semi-invertible version of MET stated
in Theorem 1. This forces us to develop an argument (based on Lemma 1), which is
completely diﬀerent from the one in [5], to ﬁrst establish exponential bounds for A along
the subspaces in (19) and then use this to deduce an appropriate bound for the angle
between those subspaces.

Theorem 2. Let A be a cocycle over f satisfying (1) with Lyapunov exponents as in (2)
and take i ∈ {1, . . . , k}. Let

E1(x) =

i

Mj=1

Ej(x)

and E2(x) =

k

Mj=i+1

Ej(x).

Then, there exists a Borel set Λ ⊂ X such that µ(Λ) = 1 and for each ε > 0 there are
measurable functions C, K : Λ → (0, ∞) with the property that for every x ∈ Λ we have
that:

6

1. for each v ∈ E1(x) and n ≥ 0,

kA(x, n)vk ≤ C(x)e(λi+ε)nkvk,

(20)

where if i = 1 and λ1 = −∞, λ1 is replaced by any number that belongs to the
interval (−∞, λ2);

2. for each v ∈ E2(x) and n ≥ 0,

kA(x, n)vk ≥

1

C(x)

e(λi+1−ε)nkvk;

3. for each u ∈ E1(x) and v ∈ E2(x),

kuk ≤ K(x)ku + vk and kvk ≤ K(x)ku + vk,

4. for each n ∈ Z,

C(f n(x)) ≤ C(x)eε|n|

and K(f n(x)) ≤ K(x)eε|n|.

(21)

(22)

(23)

Proof.

Step 1 – Upper bound for growth on E1 and temperedness of the function C: We begin

by establishing property (20). We start with the following lemma.

Lemma 2. We have

lim sup

n

logkA(x, n)|E1(x)k ≤ λi

for µ-a.e. x ∈ X,

(24)

where A(x, n)|E1(x) denotes the restriction of A(x, n) onto E1(x).

Proof of the lemma. Let {e1, . . . , el} be an orthonormal basis for E1(x). For each n ∈ N
let vn ∈ E1(x) be such that kvnk = 1 and kA(x, n)|E1(x)k = kA(x, n)vnk. Furthemore,
for n ∈ N, write vn in the form

vn =

l

Xj=1

aj,nej,

for aj,n ∈ R. We note that |aj,n| = |hvn, eji| ≤ kvnk · kejk = 1 and thus

kA(x, n)|E1(x)k ≤

l

Xj=1

|aj,n| · kA(x, n)ejk ≤

l

Xj=1

kA(x, n)ejk.

(25)

Since ej ∈ E1(x), it follows from (5) that

lim sup

n→∞

1
n

logkA(x, n)ejk ≤ λi,

for j ∈ {1, . . . , l}.

Finally, we note that (25) and (26) readily imply (24).

It follows from (24) that for ε > 0,

D(x) := sup
n≥0

{kA(x, n)|E1(x)k · e−(λi+ε)n} < ∞,

(26)

(cid:3)

(27)

for µ a.e. x ∈ X.

Lemma 3. We have

lim

n→±∞

n

log D(f n(x)) = 0

for µ-a.e. x ∈ X.

(28)

Proof of the lemma. For n ≥ 1, we have

kA(x, n)|E1(x)k ≤ kA(f (x), n − 1)|E1(f (x))k · kA(x)|E1(x)k

≤ kA(f (x), n − 1)|E1(f (x))k · kA(x)k.

By multiplying the above inequality by e−(λi+ε)n, we obtain

e−(λi+ε)nkA(x, n)|E1(x)k ≤ e−(λi+ε)(n−1)kA(f (x), n − 1)|E1(f (x))k · e−(λi+ε)kA(x)k.

Hence,

D(x) ≤ D(f (x)) · max{e−(λi+ε)kA(x)k, 1}.

It follows from (1) that there exists an nonnegative and integrable function ψ : X → R
such that

Set

We note that

log D(x) − log D(f (x)) ≤ ψ(x).

˜D(x) = log D(x) − log D(f (x)).

for each x ∈ X and n ∈ N. By (29), we have that ˜D+ is integrable. Hence, we can apply
the Birkhoﬀ ergodic theorem (see p.539 [3]) and conclude that there exists a ∈ [−∞, ∞)
such that

n−1

˜D(f j(x)) = a,

(31)

for µ-a.e. x ∈ X. It follows from (30) and (31) that

lim
n→∞

n

log D(f n(x)) = −a.

On the other hand, since µ is f -invariant, for any c > 0 we have that

lim
n→∞

µ({x ∈ X : log D(f n(x))/n ≥ c}) = lim
n→∞

µ({x ∈ X : log D(x) ≥ nc}) = 0,

which immediately implies that a ≥ 0. Thus,

lim
n→∞

1
n

log D(f n(x)) ≤ 0.

Since D(x) ≥ 1 for µ a.e. x ∈ X by (27), we conclude that (28) holds when n → ∞.

Now we establish (28) for the case n → −∞. Set

D′(x) = log D(f −1(x)) − log D(x).

Obviously,

for µ-a.e. x ∈ X. Once can now proceed as in the previous case and obtain that a = 0,
which implies (28).

It follows from (28) and Proposition 4.3.3(ii) in [3] that there exists a nonnegative
and measurable function C deﬁned on a set of full-measure satisfying the ﬁrst inequality
in (23) such that D(x) ≤ C(x) which together with (27) implies that (20) holds.

Step 2 – Lower bound for growth on E2 and temperedness of the function 1/C: We
now show (21). By Theorem 1, the cocycle A is invertible along the subbundle E2.
We would like to apply Step 1 to the inverse of the cocycle obtained by restricting A
onto the subbundle E2 to conclude that (21) holds for some function C satisfying the
ﬁrst inequality in (23) on a set of full measure. In order to do this, we ﬁrst require the
integrability condition of Lemma 4.

Hence,

In view of (1), setting

(35)
it remains to prove ψ− ∈ L1(µ). We ﬁrst note that ψ(x) ≤ logkA(x)km = m logkA(x)k,
which together with (1) implies that ψ+ ∈ L1(µ).

Let again {v1, . . . , vm} be an orthonormal basis for E2(x). Then by going backwards
in (2) (which is possible by Lemma 20 [12]), we can ﬁnd λ ∈ R such that for suﬃciently

which implies the integrability of ψ−.

(cid:3)

To ﬁnish this step, we now establish the existence of function C satisfying (21) and
the ﬁrst inequality in (23). By Theorem 1, the map A(x) is invertible along the direction
E2(x) and we will denote the inverse of this map by A−1(x). Let B be a cocycle over
f −1 deﬁned on a subbundle E2(x) with generator A−1 ◦ f −1. It follows from Theorem 1,
Lemma 4 and Lemma 20 [12] that the Lyapunov exponents of the cocycle B are given by

−λk < . . . < −λi+1.

Furthermore, Ej(x) is the Oseledets subspace corresponding to −λj for i + 1 ≤ j ≤ k.We
can now apply Step 1 to B to conclude that that there exists a function C : Λ → (0, ∞)
such that

kB(x, n)vk ≤ C(x)e(−λi+1+ ε

2 )n,

for x ∈ Λ, n ≥ 0 and v ∈ Ej+1(x) ⊕ . . . ⊕ Ek(x)

(36)

and

C(f m(x)) ≤ C(x)e

ε

2 |m|,

for x ∈ Λ and m ∈ Z.

(37)

It follows readily from (36) and (37) that (21) holds.

Step 3 – Lower bound for K and temperedness of K:
The existence of function K satisfying (22) and (23) follows by applying Lemma 1
successively. For i = k−1, it is suﬃcient to apply Lemma 1 to E(x) = E1(x)⊕. . .⊕Ek−1(x)
and F (x) = Ek(x) using the properties (20) (both for E(x) and E(x) ⊕ F (x)) and (21)
from Steps 1 and 2. For i = k−2, we again apply Lemma 1 to E(x) = E1(x)⊕. . .⊕Ek−1(x)
and F (x) = Ek(x) and obtain a function K1 as in the statement of Lemma 1. Further, we
apply Lemma 1 to E(x) = E1(x)⊕. . .⊕Ek−2(x) and F (x) = Ek−1(x) and obtain a function
K2 as in the statement of Lemma 1. Take now an arbitrary v ∈ E1(x) ⊕ . . . ⊕ Ek−2(x)
and w ∈ Ek−1(x) ⊕ Ek(x), w = w1 + w2, w1 ∈ Ek−1(x), w2 ∈ Ek(x). By (12),

kvk ≤ K2(x)kv + w1k ≤ K1(x)K2(x)kv + wk.

(38)

Similarly,

and

Hence,

kw2k ≤ K1(x)kv + wk

kw1k ≤ K2(x)kv + w1k ≤ K1(x)K2(x)kv + wk.

kwk ≤ 2 max{K1(x), K1(x)K2(x)}kv + wk.

(39)
It follows from (38) and (39) that (22) holds for K(x) = 2 max{K1(x), K1(x)K2(x)},
which in view of (11) satisﬁes the second inequality in (23) with ε replaced by some aε
for some a > 0 (this is possible since ε > 0 can be made arbitrarily small). Proceeding
inductively, we can establish the appropriate bounds for the angle in the general case
when 1 ≤ i ≤ k.
(cid:3)

As we have already noted in the introduction, Theorem 2 plays a central role in the
proof of our main result, however, it is also a result of independent interest. For exam-
ple, it shows that the noninvertible cocycles with all nonzero Lyapunov exponents are
nonuniformly hyperbolic in the sense of Pesin (see [5] for details) on a set of full-measure.
Furthermore, it shows that the notion of a nonuniform exponential dichotomy for not
necessarily invertible discrete time dynamics (introduced by Barreira and Valls in [7])

10

is ubiquitous in the context of ergodic theory. In order to formulate an explicit result,
we recall that we say that a sequence (An)n∈Z of operators on Rd admits a nonuniform
exponential dichotomy if:

1. there exist projections Pn : Rd → Rd for each n ∈ Z satisfying

AnPn = Pn+1An

for n ∈ Z such that each map

An| ker Pn : ker Pn → ker Pn+1

is invertible;

2. there exist a constants D, λ > 0 and ε ≥ 0 such that

and

kA(m, n)Pnk ≤ De−λ(m−n)+ε|n|

for m ≥ n

kA(m, n)Qnk ≤ De−λ(n−m)+ε|n|

for m ≤ n,

where Qn = Id − Pn and

A(m, n) = (A(n, m)| ker Pm)−1 : ker Pn → ker Pm

for m < n.

The following result is a direct consequence of Theorem 2.

Theorem 3. Let A be a cocycle satisfying (1) with nonvanishing Lyapunov exponents.
Then, there exists a Borel set Λ ⊂ X of full µ-measure such that for each x ∈ Λ the
sequence (An)n∈Z deﬁned by An = A(f n(x)), n ∈ Z admits a nonuniform exponential
dichotomy.

3. An Oseledets splitting of the adjoint cocycle

The other crucial ingredient in the proof of Hölder continuity of the Oseledets splitting
(Theorem 5) is the use of the adjoint cocycle. Suppose that A is a cocycle over f whose
generator A satisﬁes (1). Moreover, assume that the Lyapunov exponents of A and
the corresponding Oseledets decomposition are given by (2) and (3). We denote by A∗
the cocycle over f −1 with generator A∗ ◦ f −1. The following result identiﬁes Lyapunov
exponents and the Oseledets splitting of the cocycle A∗. We note that this theorem is
well-known for invertible matrix cocycles (see Theorem 5.1.1 [3] for example).

Theorem 4. The Lyapunov exponents of the cocycle A∗ are given by (2). Furthermore,
the Oseledets subspace that corresponds to λi is given by

(cid:18)Mj6=i

Ej(x)(cid:19)⊥

.

(40)

Proof. Let Fi(x) be a subspace of Rd given by (40). It follows from (4) that

A(x)(cid:18)Mj6=i

Ej(x)(cid:19) ⊂ Mj6=i

Ej(f (x)),

which readily implies that A∗(f −1(x))Fi(x) ⊂ Fi(f −1(x)) for each i ∈ {1, . . . , k}. Fur-
thermore, the subspaces Fi(x) form a direct sum. Indeed, assume that

v ∈ Fi(x) ∩ (F1(x) + . . . Fi−1(x) + Fi+1(x) + . . . + Fk(x)),

11

and write v in the form v = v1 + . . . + vk, where vj ∈ Ej(x) for j = 1, . . . , k. Since

v ∈ Fi(x)

and v1 + . . . + vi−1 + vi+1 + . . . + vk ∈ Mj6=i

Ej(x),

we conclude that hv, v1 + . . . + vi−1 + vi+1 + . . . + vki = 0. On the other hand, since

v ∈ F1(x) + . . . Fi−1(x) + Fi+1(x) + . . . + Fk(x) ⊂ Ei(x)⊥,

we also have that hv, vii = 0. Hence, hv, vi = 0 and v = 0. We now want to prove that

Rd =

k

Mi=1

Fi(x).

i=1Fi(x))⊥ = ∩k

i=1Fi(x))⊥ = {0}.
In order to prove the above equality we are going to show that (⊕k
Take v ∈ (⊕k
i=1Fi(x)⊥ and write it in a form v = v1 + . . . + vk, where
vi ∈ Ei(x), i = 1, . . . , k. Since v and v2 + . . . + vk both belong to F1(x)⊥, we conclude
that v1 ∈ F1(x)⊥. However, since the subspaces Ej(x) form a direct sum of Rd this
implies that v1 = 0. Similarly, we obtain that vj = 0 for j = 2, . . . , k and thus v = 0. In
order to complete the proof of the theorem, we are going to show that for µ-a.e. x ∈ X,

lim
n→∞

1
n

logkA∗(x, n)uk = λi,

for u ∈ Fi(x) \ {0} and i ∈ {1, . . . , k}.

(41)

Take i ≥ 2 and u ∈ Fi(x) \ {0}. We ﬁrst note that A∗(x, n) = A(f −n(x), n)∗. Hence,

kA∗(x, n)uk = max
kvk=1

|hA∗(x, n)u, vi| = max
kvk=1

|hu, A(f −n(x), n)vi|.

(42)

For v ∈ Ei(f −n(x)), kvk = 1, one has A(f −n(x), n)v ∈ Ei(x). Since u ∈ Fi(x) \ {0},
setting

c = c(x) =

2

we have

sup{|hw1, w2i| : w1 ∈ Fi(x), w2 ∈ Ei(x), kw1k = kw2k = 1},

kA∗(x, n)uk = max
kvk=1

|hu, A(f −n(x), n)vi| ≥ ckuk · kA(f −n(x), n)vk.

(43)

On the other hand, it follows from Theorem 2 that for each ε > 0, there exists a mea-
surable function C : Λ → (0, ∞) deﬁned on a Borel set Λ ⊂ X of full µ-measure such
that

C(f n(x)) ≤ C(x)eε|n|

for x ∈ Λ and n ∈ Z,

and

kA(x, n)wk ≥

1

C(x)

e(λi−ε)nkwk for x ∈ Λ, w ∈ Ei(x) and n ≥ 0.

It follows from (44) and (45) that

kA(f −n(x), n)vk ≥

1

C(x)

e(λi−2ε)n,

for n ≥ 0.

By (42), (43) and (46), we have

lim inf
n→∞

1
n

logkA∗(x, n)uk ≥ λi − 2ε.

Since ε > 0 was arbitrary, we conclude that

lim inf

n

logkA∗(x, n)uk ≥ λi.

12

(44)

(45)

(46)

(47)

Now take an arbitrary v ∈ Rd, kvk = 1 and write it as v = v1 + . . . + vk, where
vj ∈ Ej(f −n(x)) for j = 1, . . . , k. Since u ∈ Fi(x), we have that hu, A(f −n(x), n)vji = 0
for j 6= i. Hence,

|hu, A(f −n(x), n)vi| = |hu, A(f −n(x), n)vii| ≤ kuk · kA(f −n(x), n)vik.

(48)

Furthermore, it follows from Theorem 2 that for each ε > 0 there exists measurable
functions C, K : Λ → (0, ∞) deﬁned on a Borel set Λ of full µ-measure such that for
every x ∈ Λ and n ∈ Z we have:

kA(x, n)wk ≤ C(x)e(λi+ε)nkwk for w ∈ Ei(x), n ≥ 0,

kwik ≤ K(x)kw1 + w2k for i ∈ {1, 2}, w1 ∈ Ei(x) and w2 ∈ ⊕j6=iEj(x),

(49)

(50)

and

C(f n(x)) ≤ C(x)eε|n|

and K(f n(x)) ≤ K(x)eε|n|.

(51)
We note that the existence of the function K can be easily deduced from the appropriate
bounds for the angles between ⊕i
j=1Ej(x) and
Ei(x) (see Lemma 1 and the proof of Theorem 2). Thus,

j=i+1Ej(x) as well as ⊕i−1

j=1Ej(x) and ⊕k

kA(f −n(x), n)vik ≤ C(f −n(x))e(λi+ε)nkvik

≤ C(f −n(x))K(f −n(x))e(λi+ε)nkvk
≤ C(x)K(x)e(λi+3ε)n.

Hence, using (42) and (48) we obtain

lim sup

n→∞

n

logkA∗(x, n)uk ≤ λi + 3ε.

Since ε > 0 was arbitrary, we conclude that

lim sup

n→∞

n

logkA∗(x, n)uk ≤ λi.

(52)

Obviously, (47) and (52) imply (41). Now we discuss the case i = 1. If λ1 > −∞ then
one can repeat the above arguments and establish (41) for i = 1 also. If λ1 = −∞, then
one can repeat the second estimates and obtain that

lim sup

n→∞

n

logkA∗(x, n)uk ≤ L,

for u ∈ F1(x), where L is arbitrary real number. By letting L → −∞, we establish (41)
in this situation also.

4. Hölder continunity of Oseledets splitting

In this section we prove that the Oseledets subspaces of a Hölder continuous cocycle A
are Hölder continuous on a set of arbitrarily large measure in X. For a subspace A ⊂ Rd
and a vector v ∈ Rd we deﬁne

Furthermore, for two subspaces V and W of Rd we deﬁne the distance between them by

d(v, A) = inf{kv − wk : w ∈ A}.

d(V, W ) = max(cid:26) sup

w∈W,kwk=1

d(w, V ),

sup

v∈V,kvk=1

d(v, W )(cid:27).

It turns out that the quantity d(V, W ) can be expressed in an equivalent form which will
be more suitable for our purposes. Let PV : Rd → Rd and PW : Rd → Rd be orthogonal

13

projections onto V and W respectively. The following lemma is well-known; see e.g. page
111 in [1].

Lemma 5. For any two subspaces V, and W of Rd we have that

d(V, W ) = kPV − PW k.

Let X now be a metric space with a metric ρ and let Λ ⊂ X. We say that the family
E(x), x ∈ Λ of subspaces of Rd is Hölder continuous on Λ if there exist L, ε0 > 0 and
β ∈ (0, 1] such that

d(E(x), E(y)) ≤ Lρ(x, y)β,

for every x, y ∈ Λ satisfying ρ(x, y) ≤ ε0.

We now introduce the notion of Hölder continuous cocycle. We say that the cocycle A is
Hölder continuous if there exist C, ν > 0 such that
kA(x) − A(y)k ≤ Cρ(x, y)ν,

for x, y ∈ X.

The following two simple lemmas will be particulary useful.

Lemma 6. Let Λ ⊂ X. A family E(x), x ∈ Λ of subspaces of Rd is Hölder continuous if
and only if the family E(x)⊥, x ∈ Λ is Hölder continuous.

Proof. Let P (x) denote the orthogonal projection onto E(x) for x ∈ Λ. Then, Id − P (x)
is an orthogonal projection onto E(x)⊥. Hence, it follows from Lemma 5 that

d(E(x), E(y)) = kP (x) − P (y)k = k(Id − P (x)) − (Id − P (y))k

= d(E(x)⊥, E(y)⊥),

for every x, y ∈ Λ. The conclusion of the lemma now follows directly from the deﬁnition
of the Hölder continuity.
(cid:3)

Lemma 7. Let Λ ⊂ X and assume that E(x), F (x), x ∈ Λ are two families of subspaces
of Rd such that:

1. the subspaces E(x) and F (x) are orthogonal for each x ∈ Λ;
2. the family E(x), x ∈ Λ is Hölder continuous;
3. the family E(x) ⊕ F (x), x ∈ Λ is Hölder continuous.

Then, the family F (x), x ∈ Λ is also Hölder continuous.

Proof. Let P (x) be an orthogonal projection onto E(x) and let Q(x) be an orthogonal
projection onto F (x) for x ∈ Λ. Since E(x) and F (x) are orthogonal, we have that
P (x)+Q(x) is an orthogonal projection onto E(x)⊕F (x). Hence, it follows from Lemma 5
that

d(F (x), F (y)) = kQ(x) − Q(y)k ≤ k(P (x) + Q(x)) − (P (y) + Q(y))k

+ kP (x) − P (y)k

= d(E(x) ⊕ F (x), E(y) ⊕ F (y))

+ d(E(x), E(y)),

for every x, y ∈ Λ. The Hölder continuity of the family F (x) follows directly from the
Hölder continuity of families E(x) ⊕ F (x) and E(x).
(cid:3)

We will use the following two auxiliary results from [2] which are slight generalisations

of the original work of Brin [8] (see also Lemmas 5.3.4. and 5.3.5. in [5]).
Lemma 8. Let (An)n≥1, (Bn)n≥1 be two sequences of real matrices of order d > 0 such
that for some 0 < λ < µ and C ≥ 1 there exist subspaces E, E′, F, F ′ of Rd satisfying
Rd = E ⊕ E′ = F ⊕ F ′ such that:

14

1. kAnuk ≤ Cλnkuk for u ∈ E and C −1µnkvk ≤ kAnvk for v ∈ E′;
2. kBnuk ≤ Cλnkuk for u ∈ F and C −1µnkvk ≤ kBnvk for v ∈ F ′;
3. max{kvk, kwk} ≤ dkv + wk for v ∈ E, w ∈ E′ or v ∈ F , w ∈ F ′.

Then for each pair (δ, a) ∈ (0, 1] × [λ, +∞) satisfying

a(cid:19)n+1
(cid:18)λ

a(cid:19)n
< δ ≤ (cid:18) λ

and kAn − Bnk ≤ δan,

we have that d(E, F ) ≤ (2 + d)C 2 µ

λ δlog(µ/λ)/ log(a/λ).

Lemma 9. Assume that A is a Hölder continuous cocycle and that there exists L > 0
such that f is Lipschitz with constant L and such that kA(x, n)k ≤ Ln for n ≥ 0 and x in
some ﬁxed compact set Λ ⊂ X. Then, there exist C, ν > 0 such that kA(x, n)−A(y, n)k ≤
C nd(x, y)ν for x, y ∈ Λ and n ≥ 0.

We now arrive at our main result.

Theorem 5. Let A be a Hölder continuous cocycle satisfying (1) whose Lyapunov expo-
nents and the corresponding Oseledets splitting are given by (2) and (3). Then, for each
i ∈ {1, . . . , k} and δ > 0 there exists a compact set Λ ⊂ X of measure µ(Λ) > 1 − δ such
that the map x 7→ Ei(x) is Hölder continuous on Λ.

Proof. We will divide the proof into several parts.

Step 1 – Hölder continuity of x 7→ E1(x) ⊕ . . . ⊕ Ei(x): We will ﬁrst show that for each
i ∈ {1, . . . , k} and δ > 0, there exists a compact set Λ ⊂ X satisfying µ(Λ) > 1 − δ and
such that the map x 7→ E1(x) ⊕ . . . ⊕ Ei(x) is Hölder continuous on Λ. We note that
this part is essentially already contained in [8], [5] and [2]; we include it for the sake of
completeness.

Choosing ε > 0 such that λi + ε < λi+1 − ε, it follows from Theorem 2 that there exists
a Borel set Λ ⊂ X satisfying µ(Λ) = 1 and Borel measurable functions C, K : Λ → (0, ∞)
such that (20), (21), (22) and (23) hold (with the same convention as in the statement
of Theorem 2 for λ1 in (20) if i = 1). Moreover, there exists a measurable function
˜C : Λ → (0, ∞) such that

kA(x, n)k ≤ ˜C(x)e(λk+ε)n,

for x ∈ Λ and n ≥ 0.

(53)

For l ∈ N, let

Λl = {x ∈ Λ : C(x) ≤ l, ˜C(x) ≤ l, K(x) ≤ l}.

It is easy to verify (see p.121 [5]) that each set Λl is compact. Furthermore, we obviously
have that

∞

Λl ⊂ Λl+1

and

Λl = Λ.

[l=1

Since µ(Λ) = 1, there exists l ∈ N such that µ(Λl) > 1 − δ. On the other hand, it follows
from (20), (21), (22) and (23) that for every x ∈ Λl,

kA(x, n)vk ≤ le(λi+ε)nkvk,

for v ∈ E1(x) ⊕ . . . ⊕ Ei(x) and n ≥ 0;

e(λi+1−ε)nkvk ≤ kA(x, n)vk,

for v ∈ Ei+1(x) ⊕ . . . ⊕ Ek(x) and n ≥ 0;

(54)

(55)

1
l

and

(56)
for u ∈ E1(x) ⊕ . . . ⊕ Ei(x) and v ∈ Ei+1(x) ⊕ . . . ⊕ Ek(x). Moreover, it follows from (53)
that

kuk ≤ lku + vk and kvk ≤ lku + vk,

kA(x, n)k ≤ le(λk+ε)n,

for every x ∈ Λl and n ≥ 0.

(57)

15

Hence, applying Lemmas 8 and 9 to sequences An = A(x, n) and Bn = A(y, n) with
x, y ∈ Λl, we easily obtain the Hölder continuity of the map x 7→ E1(x) ⊕ . . . ⊕ Ei(x) on
Λl.

Step 2 – Hölder continuity of x 7→ Ei+1(x) ⊕ . . . ⊕ Ek(x): We now prove that for each
i ∈ {1, . . . , k − 1} and δ > 0, there exists a compact set Λ ⊂ X satisfying µ(Λ) > 1 − δ
and such that the map x 7→ Ei+1(x) ⊕ · · · ⊕ Ek(x) is Hölder continuous on Λ. We note
that

(cid:18)Ei+1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Ek(x)(cid:19)⊥

= (cid:18)Mj6=1

Ej(x)(cid:19)⊥

⊕ · · · ⊕(cid:18)Mj6=i

Ej(x)(cid:19)⊥

= F1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Fi,

where Fj, j = 1, . . . , i are the Oseledets spaces of the adjoint cocycle and the second
equality follows from Theorem 4. We now apply Step 1 to the adjoint cocycle to to ﬁnd
a measurable set Λ ⊂ X satisfying µ(Λ) > 1 − δ and such that the map

x 7→= F1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Fi = (cid:18)Ei+1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Ek(x)(cid:19)⊥

is Hölder continuous on Λ. The desired conclusion now follows directly from Lemma 6.
We note that this part is also contained in [8], [5] and [2], but is obtained by applying
previous step to the inverse of A. Such an approach is unavailable to us because the
inverse of A may not exist.

Step 3 – Hölder continuity of x 7→ Ei(x): In the ﬁnal part, we prove that for each
i ∈ {1, . . . , k} and δ > 0, there exists a compact set Λ ⊂ X satisfying µ(Λ) > 1 − δ and
such that the map x 7→ Ei(x) is Hölder continuous on Λ. We note that our arguments
related to this part of the proof diﬀer signiﬁcantly from those in [2] and are arguably
simpler. For i = 1 or i = k there is nothing to prove since the conclusion follows directly
from the previous two steps. Take now an arbitrary i ∈ {2, . . . , k − 1} and δ > 0 and
let Λl be the set of measure greater then 1 − δ constructed in the ﬁrst step of the proof.
Without loss of the generality we can assume that the mapping x 7→ Ei(x) ⊕ . . . ⊕ Ek(x)
is Hölder continuous on Λl since otherwise (using Step 2 of the proof) we can pass to a
compact subset of Λl of measure greater then 1 − 2δ on which this holds. Let P (x) denote
the orthogonal projection onto F (x) := Ei(x) ⊕ . . . ⊕ Ek(x). For a point x ∈ Λl, we deﬁne
a sequence of matrices (An)n by An = A(x, n)P (x). Choose any v ∈ F (x)⊥ ⊕ Ei(x) and
write it in the form v = v1 + v2 where v1 ∈ F (x)⊥ and v2 ∈ Ei(x). Using (54) and the
orthogonality of F (x)⊥ and Ei(x), we conclude that

kAnvk = kAnv2k = kA(x, n)v2k ≤ le(λi+ε)nkv2k ≤ le(λi+ε)nkvk.

Hence,

kAnvk ≤ le(λi+ε)nkvk,

for every v ∈ F (x)⊥ ⊕ Ei(x) and n ≥ 0.

(58)

On the other hand, it follows readily from (55) that

1
l

e(λi+1−ε)nkvk ≤ kAnvk,

for every v ∈ Ei+1(x) ⊕ . . . ⊕ Ek(x) and n ≥ 0.

We now want to establish appropriate bounds for the angles between F (x)⊥ ⊕ Ei(x) and
Ei+1(x) ⊕ . . . ⊕ Ek(x). Select an arbitrary u = u1 + u2 ∈ F (x)⊥ ⊕ Ei(x) with u1 ∈ F (x)⊥,
u2 ∈ Ei(x), and v ∈ Ei+1(x) ⊕ . . . ⊕ Ek(x). By (56), we have that

ku + vk2 = ku1 + u2 + vk2 = ku1k2 + ku2 + vk2 ≥ ku2 + vk2 ≥

1
l2 kvk2,

which implies that

lku + vk ≥ kvk.

Similarly,

ku + vk2 = ku1k2 + ku2 + vk2 ≥

1
l2 (ku1k2 + ku2k2) =

1
l2 kuk2,

which implies that

Hence,

lku + vk ≥ kuk.

max{kuk, kvk} ≤ lku + vk,

for u ∈ F (x)⊥ ⊕ Ei(x) and v ∈

k

Mj=i+1

Ej(x).

In order to apply Lemma 8, we need to bound the quantity kAn − Bnk, where Bn =
A(y, n)P (y) and y is some other point in Λl. We have

kAn − Bnk

= kA(x, n)P (x) − A(y, n)P (y)k
≤ kA(x, n)P (x) − A(x, n)P (y)k + kA(x, n)P (y) − A(y, n)P (y)k
≤ kA(x, n)k · d(F (x), F (y)) + kA(x, n) − A(y, n)k.

By applying Lemma 9, (57) and the Hölder continuity of the map x 7→ F (x) we conclude
that there exists C, ν > 0 (independent of x and y) such that

kAn − Bnk ≤ C nd(x, y)ν.

It now follows from Lemma 8 that the map x 7→ F (x)⊥ ⊕ Ei(x) is Hölder continuous on
a set Λl, which in view of Lemma 7 implies the Hölder continuity of the map x 7→ Ei(x)
on the same set.

5. Cocycles on Hilbert spaces

In this section we state a generalization of our results to cocycles on Hilbert spaces.

Theorem 6. Let X be a Borel subset of a separable complete metric space, f : X (cid:9)
be a bi-Lipschitz ergodic transformation, H a Hilbert space, and A : X → B(H) take
values in the space of all compact operators. Further, assume that A satisﬁes (1) and
that x 7→ A(x) is Hölder continuous in the operator norm topology. Then either:

1. There is a ﬁnite sequence of numbers (note that below we order Lyapunov exponents
and Oseledets spaces in reverse order to (2) and (3) starting with the largest one)

λ1 > λ2 > · · · > λk > λ∞ = −∞

H = E1(x) ⊕ · · · ⊕ Ek(x) ⊕ E∞(x)

and a decomposition

such that

A(x)Ei(x) = Ei(f (x)), i = 1, . . . , k

and A(x)E∞(x) ⊂ E∞(f (x))

and

lim
n→∞

1
n

logkA(x, n)vk = λi,

for v ∈ Ei(x) \ {0}, i ∈ {1, . . . , k} ∪ {∞}.

Moreover, each Ei(x), i = 1, . . . , k is a ﬁnite-dimensional subspace of H. The maps
x 7→ Ei(x), i = 1, . . . , k are Hölder continuous on a compact set of arbitrarily large
measure.

2. There exists an inﬁnite sequence of numbers

λ1 > λ2 > · · · > λk > . . . > λ∞ = −∞

and a decomposition

H = E1(x) ⊕ · · · ⊕ Ek(x) ⊕ · · · ⊕ E∞(x)

such that

and

lim
n→∞

1
n

A(x)Ei(x) ⊂ Ei(f (x)) (with equality if for i ∈ N)

logkA(x, n)vk = λi,

for v ∈ Ei(x) \ {0}, i ∈ N ∪ {∞}.

Moreover, each Ei(x), i 6= ∞ is a ﬁnite-dimensional subspace of H. The maps
x 7→ Ei(x), i 6= ∞ are Hölder continuous on a compact set of arbitrarily large
measure.

Proof. In cases 1. and 2., all statements except the Hölder continuity follow from Theorem
17 [12], which extends Theorem 1 to a semi-invertible version of Oseledets’ theorem under
weaker conditions than those in our hypotheses, namely f is an ergodic homeomorphism,
H is a Banach space, A takes values in the space of all quasi-compact operators, and
x 7→ A(x) is µ-continuous; the resulting Oseledets splitting is µ-continuous.

Case 1: In this case one is able to repeat the arguments in the proof of Theorem 5
and establish the Hölder continuity. Indeed, we emphasize that all of the preparatory
results that we used extend to this setting. In particular, Theorem 4 and Lemma 8 are
valid for cocycles on Hilbert space (with the same proof) and the corresponding version
of Theorem 2 also holds. More precisely, one is able to repeat all arguments in the proof
Theorem 2 with the exception of Lemma 2.

An appropriate version of Lemma 2 follows along the lines of the proof of Proposition 15
[12]. With reference to the latter proof, instead of considering the cocycle on the entire Ba-
nach space as in [12], one instead considers the cocycle restricted to E1(x) from Lemma 2.
n logkA(x, n)|E1(x)k
The roles of λ(ω) and Λ(ω) in Prop. 15 [12] are played by lim supn→∞
and supv∈E 1(x),kvk=1 lim supn→∞(1/n) log kA(x, n)vk, respectively, in Lemma 2.

Case 2: Arguing as in case 1. above, one is able to show Hölder continuity of Oseledets
subspaces Ei(x) for i 6= ∞ on a compact set of arbitrarily large measure for any Hölder
continuous cocycle. Unfortunately, we are not able to establish a similar property for
E∞(x). The major obstacle in repeating our arguments is the fact that one doesn’t have
a lower bound for the expansion on a subspace complementary to E∞(x).
