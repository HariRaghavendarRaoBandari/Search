Abstract

We study spectral properties of the Neumann–Poincar´e operator on planar domains with
corners with particular emphasis on existence of continuous spectrum and pure point spec-
trum. We show that the rate of resonance at continuous spectrum is diﬀerent from that at
eigenvalues, and then derive a method to distinguish continuous spectrum from eigenvalues.
We perform computational experiments using the method to see whether continuous spec-
trum and pure point spectrum appear on domains with corners. For the computations we
use a modiﬁcation of the Nystr¨om method which makes it possible to construct high-order
convergent discretizations of the Neumann–Poincar´e operator on domains with corners. The
results of experiments show that all three possible spectra, absolutely continuous spectrum,
singularly continuous spectrum, and pure point spectrum, may appear depending on do-
mains. We also prove rigorously two properties of spectrum which are suggested by numer-
ical experiments: symmetry of spectrum (including continuous spectrum), and existence of
eigenvalues on rectangles of high aspect ratio.

1 Introduction
Let Ω be a bounded simply connected domain in R2 with the Lipschitz boundary. The Neumann–
Poincar´e (NP) operator on Ω is deﬁned by

∂Ω

where n(x) denotes the unit outward normal vector to ∂Ω at x ∈ ∂Ω and p.v. stands for the
Cauchy principal value. Recently there is rapidly growing interest in the spectral properties of
the NP operator due to its relation to plasmonics and cloaking by anomalous localized resonance:
Plasmon resonance occurs at eigenvalues of the NP operator and anomalous localized resonance
occurs at the accumulation point of eigenvalues, respectively (see, for example, [1, 19, 20] and
references therein).
∂Ω is not self-adjoint with respect to the usual L2-inner product
unless Ω is a disk or a ball [18], it can be realized as a self-adjoint operator on H−1/2(∂Ω) space

by introducing a new inner product (see [12, 16] and the next section for a brief review). Here
and throughout this paper H s denotes the usual L2 Sobolev space. So, the NP operator can have
only three kinds of spectra: absolutely continuous spectrum, singularly continuous spectrum,
and pure point spectrum (eigenvalues) [24, 26].

Observe that the NP operator depends on Ω in two ways: integration over ∂Ω and the normal
vector n(x). So, its spectral nature diﬀers depending on smoothness of the domain on which it
is deﬁned. If the domain has a smooth boundary, C1,α for some α > 0 to be precise, then the
NP operator is compact on H−1/2(∂Ω) and its spectrum consists of eigenvalues converging to
0. It is worth mentioning that a convergence rate of eigenvalues of the NP operator on smooth
domains (among others) is obtained in a recent paper [21]. However, not much is known about
the spectrum of the NP operator deﬁned on the domain with corners. Bounds on the essential
spectrum on curvilinear polygonal domains have been obtained in [22]. Recently a complete
spectral resolution of the NP operator on the intersecting disk has been derived in [14], which
in particular shows that there is only absolutely continuous spectrum, no point spectrum and
no singularly continuous spectrum. It is worth mentioning that it also shows that the bound
in previous mentioned paper is sharp for the intersecting disks. We mention that T. Carleson
solutions of the interface problem on intersecting disks, which is closely related to the continuous
spectrum (there was no notion of continuous spectrum at his time). So the paper [14] may be
regarded as a modern (and more complete) treatise of [4] even if the former was written without
knowing existence of the latter. We also refer to a recent work [17] where plasmon resonance on
intersecting disks was studied in a numerical way.

Some natural questions arise regarding the spectrum of the NP operator on general domains
with corners: Does it always have a continuous spectrum?, no point spectrum?, and so on. The
purpose of this paper is to address these questions. On the one hand, we investigate these ques-
tions in a numerical way as the ﬁrst step toward a better understanding of the spectral nature of
the NP operator on domains with corners. Novelty of the computational approach of this paper
may be found in two aspects. Firstly we present a way to classify spectra based on resonance.
Extending the analysis of [14] we show that the resonance at absolutely continuous spectrum is
weaker than that at eigenvalues. We quantify the rate of resonance and develop a computational
method to distinguish absolutely continuous spectrum from eigenvalues. Singularly continuous
spectrum is more diﬃcult to classify. However, if a strong resonance occurs at a point inside
the absolutely continuous spectrum, we may infer that the point is in the singularly continuous
spectrum. Another important aspect of this paper is the method of computation. For classi-
ﬁcation of spectra using resonance high precision computations are required. However, when
the domain has corners, it is quite diﬃcult to compute with high precision the NP operator.
In this paper we use the Recursively Compressed Inverse Preconditioning (RCIP) method [10],
explained in detail in [6, 7], which is a high precision method for solving integral equations on
piecewise smooth boundaries. It is worth mentioning that this method has been successfully
adapted for computation of polarizability on domains with corners [9].

Results of computational experiments of this paper reveal that absolutely continuous spec-
trum always appears on planar domains with corners, while pure point spectrum and singularly
continuous spectrum may or may not appear depending on domains. For example, for rectangles
there is a threshold r0 of the aspect ratio such that if the aspect ratio is less than r0 then no
eigenvalue appears, and if the aspect ratio is larger than r0 then eigenvalues appear. In fact,
more and more eigenvalues appear as the aspect ratio increases. But no singularly continuous
spectrum appears. On perturbed ellipses, singularly continuous spectrum (discrete eigenvalues
embedded in absolutely continuous spectrum) appears.

On the other hand, we prove rigorously some important spectral properties of the NP op-
erator suggested by computational experiments. We ﬁrst show that the spectrum of the NP

2

operator on planar domains is symmetric with respect to 0. This fact is known for eigenvalues
[25]. We extend it to include the continuous spectrum by proving that the resolvent of the NP
operator is symmetric with respect to 0. Inspired by computational results on rectangles we
also prove that the NP operator on a rectangle has at least one eigenvalue if the aspect ratio
of the rectangle is high enough. We ﬁrst show that the spectral bound on rectangles tends to
1/2 as the aspect ratio tends to ∞, and then existence of an eigenvalue follows as an immediate
consequence. The numerical results of this paper also show that the interval determined by
the bound on the essential spectrum obtained in [22] is actually the essential spectrum. After
completion of the major part of this work we were informed by Mihai Putinar that he and Karl-
Mikael Perfekt prove this rigorously [23]. Their paper and the current one are complementary
to each other.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section we review symmetrization
of the NP operator, and prove symmetry of spectrum and existence of eigenvalues on rectan-
gles of high aspect ratio. In section 3 we present a method to classify spectra by quantifying
resonance. For computation of resonance we use polarizable dipoles as a source function. We
show advantages using polarizable dipoles in section 4. Section 5 is to describe the computa-
tional method (RCIP method) of this paper. Section 6 is to present results of computational
experiments. This paper ends with a short conclusion and discussion on mathematical problems
raised by computational results.

We will present a method based on resonance to distinguish continuous spectrum from pure
point spectrum in the section 3. Results of numerical experiments presented in section 6 show
that the spectrum is symmetric with respect to 0. They also shows that on rectangles more and
more eigenvalues appear as the aspect ratio increases, in particular, the pure point spectrum
is non-empty if the aspect ratio is high enough. Let us prove rigorously these facts ﬁrst in the
following subsections.

2.1 Symmetry of spectrum

Here we prove that the spectrum of the NP operator in two dimensions is symmetric with respect
to 0, namely, that λ is in the spectrum if and only if −λ is. As mentioned before, this fact for
eigenvalues is known [25]. We extend it to include continuous spectrum. We emphasize that
the spectrum we are considering is that on H∗
∂Ω on
H−1/2(∂Ω) while −1/2 is not. It is worth mentioning that the spectrum of the NP operator in
three dimensions may not be symmetric with respect to 0. For example, eigenvalues on the ball
are all positive (see, for example, [12, 16]).

Let vi be a harmonic conjugate of u in Ω. Thanks to (2.14), u has a harmonic conjugate in
R2 \ Ω. Let ve be the harmonic conjugate in R2 \ Ω such that ve(x) → 0 as |x| → ∞. Then vi

appears in (2.23) since the NP operator of this paper is 1/2 times the one in [22]. If Ω is a
rectangle, bess = 1/4. We show that on rectangles of high aspect ratio b is larger than 1/4, and
hence there must be eigenvalues.

the NP operator on Ωr. It holds that

(2.24)

Above theorem shows that there is r0 such that if r ≥ r0, then br > 1/4. It means that
there is a member of spectrum λ such that 1/4 < λ. Since the essential spectrum is conﬁned in
[−1/4, 1/4] due to (2.23), λ must be an eigenvalue. So we have the following corollary.
Corollary 2.3 There is r0 such that for any r ≥ r0 the NP operator on Ωr has at least one
eigenvalue.

Proof of Theorem 2.2. We adapt the idea of the proof of Theorem 5 in [16]. For δ > 0 there
exists a C∞ odd function ψ on R such that

ψ(t) ≤ Cδ−1
ψ(t) = t

for all t,

if − 1 ≤ t ≤ 1,

where C is a universal constant independent of δ. Existence of such a function is proved in [16,
Lemma 7]. In fact, the property (2.25) is not presented there. But one can easily check that ψ
there satisﬁes (2.25). Let χ be a non-negative C∞ function on R with a compact support such
that χ(t) = 1 on [−1, 1]. Let χN (t) := χ(t/N ). Then, there is a constant C independent of N
such that

Let us use (x, y) for Cartesian coordinates in this proof. Since the NP operator is scale
invariant, we may assume Ω = Ωr := [−1, 1] × [−, ] with  = r−1. Let ψN (t) := χN (t)ψ(t) and
deﬁne

w(x, y) := χN (x)ψM (y/),

where M and N are large numbers to be determined. The function w also depends on δ which
is also to be determined. Note that w(x, y) = y/ if (x, y) ∈ Ω, in particular, it is harmonic
there. Deﬁne

Proof. The assertion (i) is an immediate consequence of (3.5), while (ii) follows from (3.7) and
(3.12). (iii) is a consequence of (i) and (ii). 2

Because of complicated nature of the singularly continuous spectrum, it is hard to classify
it from the continuous spectrum. However, αf (t) = 1 and t is not isolated (embedded in the
continuous spectrum), then we may infer that it is in the singularly continuous spectrum.

The indicator function αf (t) can be computed using the following lemma.

4 Source functions

It is quite important for the classiﬁcation of spectra using αf to choose the source function
properly. For example, to have αf (t) = 1 for classiﬁcation of eigenvalues, f needs to have a
non-zero eigenmode (the component of the corresponding eigenfunctions). To be more precise,
we consider (3.1) when δ = 0, namely,

on ∂Ω.

The matrix M (t + iδ) := (mij(t + iδ)) is called the polarization tensor. It is an analytic function
of λ = t + iδ in C \ (−1/2, 1/2), and may have singularities at λ = t in the spectra of K∗
∂Ω. The
singularities of M (t + iδ) were investigated in [9, 11] when M is isotropic. However, singularities
of M (t + iδ) can show some spectrum, but not all as the following example shows. If Ω is an
ellipse of major axis a and minor axis b, then M (λ) = M (t + iδ) is given by

M (λ) = 2πab

So, in this case M (λ) shows only two eigenvalues. It is quite interesting to observe that those
two eigenvalues are the largest (in absolute values) eigenvalues.

In this paper we use as source functions

fz(x) = ν(x) · ∇qz(x),

q(x) = d · ∇x

(cid:18) 1

2π

(cid:19)

ln|x − z|

where d is a constant unit vector and z ∈ R2 \ Ω. In fact, qz is the newtonian potential of the
polarizable dipole d · ∇δz(x) (δz(x) is the Dirac mass) located at z. The source function fz was
used in [14] for analysis of resonance on intersecting disks.

Using fz as source functions has several advantages. First of all, qz is a harmonic function

in Ω, and hence

(cid:107)fz(cid:107)H−1/2(∂Ω) ≈ (cid:107)qz(cid:107)H 1(Ω)

by the standard regularity estimates of the Neumann problem for the Laplace equation. More-
over, one can see easily that there are constants C1 and C2 such that

C1 ≤ (cid:107)qz(cid:107)H 1(Ω) ≤ C2

as long as the location z of the dipole is at some distance from Ω and ∞, namely, there are
constants C3 and C4 such that

C3 ≤ dist(z, Ω) ≤ C4.

It shows that (fz, ϕ)∗ is harmonic as a function of the z variable, and it is non-vanishing. In
fact, if (fz, ϕ)∗ = 0 for all z ∈ R2 \ Ω, then S∂Ω[∂νS∂Ω[ϕ]](z) = 0, and hence ∂νS∂Ω[ϕ] = 0 on
∂Ω. Thus ϕ = 0. As a non-vanishing harmonic function, (fz, ϕ)∗ cannot be zero for z in an
open set. So, we infer that (fz, ϕ)∗ (cid:54)= 0 for almost all z.

Still (fz, ϕ)∗ can be small for z in a large set. To avoid such a case, we choose several z’s,

say z1, . . . , zN , satisfying (4.5), and consider the new indicator function

α(cid:93)(t) := max

We emphasize that Theorem 3.1 is still valid with α(cid:93)(t) replaced with αf (t). The indicator
function α(cid:93)(t) is approximated by α(cid:93)(t, δ) for small δ, which is deﬁned by

α(cid:93)(t, δ) := max

5 Description of the numerical method

This section brieﬂy motivates and discusses the numerical method used in section 6 to solve
(3.1) and to compute the inner product (·,·)∗ in (2.4).

5.1 Nystr¨om discretization on smooth boundaries

Let K(x, y) be the kernel of an integral operator K that is compact on a smooth boundary ∂Ω
and let f (x) be a smooth function on ∂Ω. A popular method for ﬁnding numerical solutions to
Fredholm second kind boundary integral equations of the type

ϕ(x) +

∂Ω

K(x, y)ϕ(y) dσ(y) = f (x) ,

x ∈ ∂Ω ,

(5.1)

is Nystr¨om discretization: the integral in (5.1) is discretized on a mesh on ∂Ω according to
some polynomial-based quadrature rule with a number N of nodes and weights xj and wj,
j = 1, . . . , N , and the resulting semi-discrete equation for the unknown layer density ϕ(x) is
enforced at the quadrature nodes [3, Chapter 4.1]. Upon solving the resulting linear system

(cid:90)

N(cid:88)

˜ϕ(xj) +

K(xj, xk) ˜ϕ(xk)wk = r(xj) ,

j = 1, . . . , N ,

(5.2)

k=1

one obtains an approximation ˜ϕ(xj) to ϕ(xj) whose convergence with N reﬂects that of the
underlying quadrature. When (5.1) stems from a well-conditioned boundary value problem on
a domain whose boundary ∂Ω can be resolved with a moderate number of discretization points,
uniform meshes and high-order accurate quadrature rules, such as composite 16-point Gauss–
Legendre quadrature, are appropriate in the sense that they often produce solutions ˜ϕ(xj) with
a relative accuracy close to machine epsilon (mach) at modest computational costs.

12

5.2 Diﬃculties related to piecewise smooth boundaries

Eq. (3.1) of the present paper is not quite of the type (5.1). The chief diﬀerence being that the
boundary ∂Ω has a ﬁnite number of corners where the NP operator K∗
∂Ω in (3.1) is not compact.
This lack of compactness manifests itself in that the solution ϕt,δ(x) to (3.1) may exhibit a
non-smooth, oscillatory, and diverging behavior close to the corner vertices which cannot easily
be resolved by polynomials on a uniform mesh. Rather, intense mesh reﬁnement is needed for
accuracy. This, in turn, may lead to all kinds of numerical problems related to computational
economy and to stability irrespective of what numerical method is used.

Another diﬃculty with producing numerical solutions ϕt,δ(x) to (3.1) appears for very small
values of δ in combination with t being close to, or in, the spectrum of the NP operator. Finite
precision arithmetic makes it hard for any solver to distinguish between combinations of δ and
t for which a solution exists and combinations for which no solution exists. Such dichotomies
often imply numerical ill-conditioning and the loss of precision.
Finally, the computation of (·,·)∗ oﬀers challenges when ϕt,δ(x) is non-smooth, oscillatory,
and diverging. The action of the operator S∂Ω on ϕt,δ(x) may become inaccurate due to numer-
ical cancellation even if ϕt,δ(x) itself is accurate.

5.3 RCIP acceleration and Nystr¨om schemes

Fortunately, most of the numerical diﬃculties discussed in section 5.2, can be overcome by the
use of the recursively compressed inverse preconditioning (RCIP) method [7, 10], which is a
tool to improve the stability and greatly reduce the computational cost of standard Nystr¨om
discretization schemes when applied to Fredholm second kind integral equations on piecewise
smooth domains. In particular, for t at some distance away from zero, from the endpoints of the
continuous spectrum, and from the pure point spectrum, RCIP-accelerated Nystr¨om solvers in
combination with ﬁxed-point iteration, Newton’s method, and a certain homotopy technique [6,
Section 6] can often produce solutions ϕt,δ(x) to (3.1) with a relative precision of about 10· mach
for any δ. See [6, Fig. 10] for an illustration. The achievable relative precision for the inner
product (·,·)∗ is, typically, 10 · mach/δ.

In the numerical examples of section 6 in this paper we use an RCIP-accelerated Nystr¨om
solver that has previously been used to compute, very accurately, polarizabilities of various
arrangements of dielectric squares and cubes [7, 11] as well as electromagnetic resonances inside
microwave cavities with sharp edges [8]. It would carry too far to recapitulate and put in context
the fairly large collection of numerical techniques that constitute the RCIP method, so we refer
the reader to [6, 7] for details.

6 Numerical experiments

This section presents numerical results for the spectrum of the NP operator on various domains
as revealed by the indicator function α(cid:93)(t) of (4.7). On smooth domains, the spectrum consists
only of pure point spectrum and the standard Nystr¨om method of section 5.1 is very eﬃcient.
This is illustrated with experiments on ellipses and superellipses in subsections 6.1 and 6.4. All
other experiments apply to domains with corners and use the RCIP-accelerated Nystr¨om solver
mentioned in section 5.3. The high performance of this solver is demonstrated by comparison
with analytical results for intersecting disks, which is the only domain with corners for which
the spectrum is fully analyzed [14]. We present spectrum on a triangle, on rectangles of various
aspect ratios, and on an ellipse perturbed by a corner. The results for rectangles show that the
pure point spectrum can be empty or non-empty depending on the aspect ratio. The result for
the perturbed ellipse shows that there are eigenvalues embedded in the absolutely continuous

13

spectrum. So, we conclude that pure point spectrum and singularly continuous spectrum can
be non-empty depending on the geometry of the domain.

From now on, let fz be the dipole source function in (4.4). To determine α(cid:93)(t) of (4.7) for a
particular domain we use N = 103 source functions fzj located on a circle enclosing the domain.
In addition to maximizing over dipole source locations we also, for each fzj , maximize over 103
orientations of the unit vector d. In this way, the maximum in (4.7) is taken over 106 dipole
ﬁelds for each t-value. The enclosing circle is centered at the origin and has radius R.

Our experiments conﬁrm the symmetry of Theorem 2.1. They also show that the bounds on
the essential spectrum obtained in [22] are optimal. Actually, the experiments show even more:
the whole interval between the bounds is the essential spectrum. As mentioned in Introduction,
this was proved rigorously quite lately in [23].

6.1 Ellipses

Recall from (4.3) that for an ellipse with aspect ratio r, the eigenvalues of the NP operator are

(cid:18) 1 − r

(cid:19)n

, n = 1, 2, . . . .

± 1

1 + r

For n ≤ 40 and r = 3, the Nystr¨om method reproduces these eigenvalues with an absolute error
of less than 7 · 10−16. For r = 30 the error is less than 6 · 10−15. Fig. 6.1 illustrates the largest
eigenvalues for 1 ≤ r ≤ 10.

Figure 6.1: The 20 largest eigenvalues for ellipses of various aspect ratios r. Thinner ellipses
have bigger eigenvalues.

6.2 Intersecting disks

Numerical results for the spectrum of the NP operator, obtained with the RCIP-accelerated
Nystr¨om solver, are now compared with analytical results. The domain Ω is that of the inter-
secting disks in Fig. 6.2(b). We let the disk radius be a = 2 and the exterior angle at the two
corners be θ0 = π/4.
Let us brieﬂy review the analytical results for intersecting disks obtained in [14]. The spec-
trum of the NP operator has the range [−b, b] with b = 0.25, which is in agreement with (2.23),

More precisely, δ(cid:107)ϕt,δ(cid:107)2∗ converges to a positive number as δ → 0 for 0 < |t| < b with a limit
that can be expressed in terms of elementary functions of bipolar coordinates. Furthermore,
δ3/2(cid:107)ϕt,δ(cid:107)2∗ converges at |t| = b and

|log δ|−1 δ1+|Ψ2(z)|/θ0(cid:107)ϕt,δ(cid:107)2∗

converges at t = 0 .

(6.2)

In view of (6.1), the indicator function αfz (0) depends on the location of the dipole source. It
increases as z approaches ∂Ω, but never reaches one.

√
One dipole ﬁeld. We ﬁrst consider the spectrum of the intersecting disks as excited by a single
dipole source located at z = (3, 2) and orientated in the direction d = (1, 1)/
2. In Fig. 6.2,
images (c) and (d) show analytical values of αfz (t) from [14] while (e), (f), (g), and (h) show
numerical results. Table 1 compares values from Fig. 6.2(d,f) and shows that the numerical
results of (f) for δ = 10−10 exhibit a 6-digit agreement with the analytical results of (d) for
limδ→0 δ(cid:107)ϕt,δ(cid:107)2∗ when t is away from 0,±b. In Fig. 6.2(e), numerical values for αf (t, δ) (in blue)
are computed with δ = 10−10, and those for αf (t) (in red) are extrapolated from the limit
behavior of δ(cid:107)ϕt,δ(cid:107)2∗ for |t| (cid:54)= 0. At t = 0, |log δ|−1 δ1+|Ψ2(z)|/θ0(cid:107)ϕt,δ(cid:107)2∗ is instead considered
because of the property (6.2). Note that the log δ factor does not aﬀect the limit value of
αf (t, δ) as δ → 0. We conclude that analytical values and numerical results of αf (t), red graphs
in Fig. 6.2(c,e), coincide for t (cid:54)= 0 and have very similar values at t = 0.

a suﬃciently high r exhibits eigenvalues outside the continuous spectrum t ∈ [−0.25, 0.25] and
that the number of such eigenvalues increase with r. The ratio r ≈ 2.201592 is a very special
aspect ratio for which the eigenvalues of the corresponding rectangle are just about to emerge
at t = ±0.25. It is interesting to observe that α(cid:93)(t) of this rectangle is exactly same as α(cid:93)(t) of
the intersecting disks in Fig. 6.3 for t (cid:54)= 0.

Superellipses are smooth domains which can be described by the Cartesian equation

|x/r|k + |y|k = 1 ,

where r is the aspect ratio and k ≥ 2 is a positive parameter. The higher the parameter k
is, the more the superellipse resembles a rectangle. However, the spectrum of the superellipse
always consists of discrete eigenvalues only. This is so since the corresponding NP operator
is compact. Similarly as with rectangles and ellipses, superellipses with high r exhibit large
eigenvalues. Table 2 shows that eigenvalues of the superellipse that lie outside the continuous
spectrum t ∈ [−0.25, 0.25] converge to eigenvalues of the rectangle with the same r as k → ∞.

6.5 Perturbed ellipse with a corner

Fig. 6.6 shows that even a small Lipschitz perturbation of a smooth domain may induce a big
change in the spectrum. The perturbed domain has the interval of continuous spectrum, whose
bounds are determined by (2.23). Two singularly continuous spectrum lie inside the continuous
spectrum at about ±0.2, which are the largest eigenvalue of the un-perturbed ellipse.

Conclusion

We proposed a method to classify spectra of the NP operator on planar domains with Lipschitz
boundaries in terms of resonance rates. The method was implemented computationally using
the RCIP-accelerated Nystr¨om solver on domains such as intersecting disks, a triangle, rectan-
gles, superellipses, and a perturbed ellipse. The results show that the NP operators on all the
examples have absolutely continuous spectrum, and some of them have pure point spectrum or
singularly continuous spectrum. We also prove rigorously two properties of spectrum suggested
by experiments: symmetry of the spectrum and existence of pure point spectrum on rectangles
of high aspect ratio.

Several questions are raised by numerical experiments of this paper. On rectangles there is
a critical aspect ratio which separates non-existence and existence of eigenvalues, and proving
this seems quite interesting. It is also interesting to ﬁnd the relation between the number of
eigenvalues and the aspect ratio. We have shown that the rectangle gets thinner, the spectral
bound tends to 1/2 (Theorem 2.2). It is interesting and useful to extend this result to general
domains. It is desirable to construct in a rigorous manner a domain with corners whose NP
operator has singularly continuous spectrum. It is also interesting to show that the NP operator
on triangles does not have an eigenvalue.
