The dynamics of laminar-turbulent fronts in pipe ﬂow is investigated for Reynolds num-
bers between Re=1900 and Re=5500 using extensive direct numerical simulations. In this
range the ﬂow undergoes a continuous transition from localised puﬀs to weakly expanding
and ultimately to strongly expanding turbulent slugs (Barkley et al. 2015). We here inves-
tigate the physical distinction between these two types of slug by analysing time-resolved
statistics of their downstream fronts in the frame moving at the bulk turbulent advection
speed. While weak fronts travel slower than the bulk turbulent advection speed, implying
local relaminarisation, strong fronts travel faster and so feed on the laminar ﬂow ahead.
At Re ≈ 2900 the downstream front speed becomes faster than the advection speed,
marking the onset of strong fronts. We argue that large temporal ﬂuctuations of pro-
duction and dissipation at the laminar-turbulent interface drive the dynamical switches
between the two types of front observed up to Re (cid:39) 3500.

Key words: puﬀ, slug, weak front, strong front, turbulence advection

1. Introduction

In experimental studies of transition in wall-bounded shear ﬂows, turbulent patches
are typically triggered by means of localised perturbations. In pipe ﬂow at low Reynolds
numbers these patches remain localised and are referred to as puﬀs. Although puﬀs
have a well-deﬁned average length, they can decay to laminar ﬂow or split into two.
At Rec = 2040 the competition of these two processes leads to sustained spatially-
intermittent turbulent ﬂow (Avila et al. 2011). Hof et al. (2010); Samanta et al. (2011)
demonstrated that puﬀs when put into close proximity annihilate each other. They deter-
mined that between puﬀs a recovery distance of about 20 pipe diameters is required. Here
the velocity proﬁle gradually recovers towards a parabolic shape (see also the discussion
by van Doorne & Westerweel (2009)). The expanding turbulence patches which appear
at higher Reynolds numbers are referred to as slugs (Wygnanski & Champagne 1973;
Wygnanski et al. 1975). Slugs grow continuously and eventually render the ﬂow fully tur-
bulent. The transformation process from puﬀs to fully turbulent ﬂow as Reynolds number
increases as well as the structure of puﬀs and slugs have been the subject of many ex-
perimental and numerical studies in decades (Lindgren 1969; Wygnanski & Champagne

et al. 2010).

Puﬀs are arrow head-shaped structures with a sharp upstream front and a diﬀusive
downstream front (Rotta 1956; Wygnanski & Champagne 1973; Darbyshire & Mullin
1995), and inside puﬀs turbulence continuously decays from the upstream front to the
downstream front (see Fig. 1a, d). Slugs, on the contrary, have a spatially extended
bulk region between the two fronts in which turbulence shows no signiﬁcant spatial vari-
ance, indicating that the interior part of slugs is in a persistent turbulent state. In their
seminal work Wygnanski & Champagne (1973) and Wygnanski et al. (1975) postulated
that the interior of slugs corresponds to fully developed turbulence and described puﬀs
as an incomplete relaminarisation. Interestingly, it was noted that slugs take multiple
forms manifesting diﬀerent downstream front structures (Duguet et al. 2010). At mod-
erate Reynolds numbers slugs have puﬀ-like diﬀusive downstream fronts (see Fig. 1b, e),
whereas at high Reynolds numbers the downstream fronts are well-deﬁned and similar
to the upstream fronts (see Fig. 1c, f). In spite of extensive studies, the origins of the
variety of turbulence structures remained poorly understood over the past decades.

Only very recently, the bifurcation sequence leading to the various structures has been
elucidated with the guide of a newly devised advection-reaction-diﬀusion model along
with accurate front speed measurements (Barkley 2011; Barkley et al. 2015). There it was
explained that at low Reynolds numbers (Re (cid:46) 2250) pipe ﬂow behaves analogously to an
excitable system and hence only allows localised turbulent excitations that in agreement
with the observation by Samanta et al. (2011) are separated by a minimum recovery
distance. As Re increases turbulence becomes locally stable and consequently turbulent
regions grow in size, taking the form of weakly expanding slugs at moderate Reynolds
numbers (see Fig. 1b, e). The transition from puﬀs to slugs can be thus interpreted as a

change from excitability to bistability. Further increasing the Reynolds number leads to
a transition to strongly expanding slugs (see Fig. 1c, f), but both types of slug appear
to coexist in a wide range of Reynolds numbers (Barkley et al. 2015).

Although the dynamics of the two types of expanding state (corresponding to weak
and strong slugs) and their fronts were theoretically described in the model system of
Barkley et al. (2015), for real pipe ﬂow further study is needed to elucidate the physical
mechanisms distinguishing them. Besides, the model only captures the average behaviour
of the fronts, whereas fronts are highly evolving in a complicated fashion and are spatially
convoluted as demonstrated by Holzner et al. (2013). This complexity results from three
dimensionality of the interface and intrinsic turbulent ﬂuctuations and so cannot be
captured by the model. Here we carry out direct numerical simulations of the Navier–
Stokes equations for pipe ﬂow and focus on the physics of the front dynamics for 1900 (cid:54)
Re (cid:54) 5500, covering from the puﬀ regime up to strongly expanding slugs.

2. Methods

2.1. Numerical methods

We solve the Navier-Stokes equations for an incompressible ﬂuid through a circular
straight pipe with a ﬁxed mass-ﬂux. Normalising length by the pipe diameter D and
velocity by the mean velocity U , the dimensionless Navier–Stokes equations read

(2.1)

where u is the velocity and p the reduced pressure. All results shown later will be in
dimensionless units, with D for length and D/U for time. Equations (2.1) are solved
in cylindrical coordinates (r, θ, z) using the spectral-ﬁnite diﬀerence method of Willis &
Kerswell (2009). The boundary conditions are no-slip at the pipe wall and periodic in
the axial and azimuthal directions. The pressure term is eliminated from the equations
by using a Toroidal-Poloidal potential formulation of the velocity ﬁeld, which provides
a divergence-free velocity ﬁeld by construction. The equations for the potentials are
integrated in time using a second-order predictor-corrector scheme, and the potentials
are expanded in Fourier modes

where αk and m are the wave numbers of the modes in the axial and azimuthal direction
respectively, 2π/α gives the pipe length Lz, and ˆAk,m is the complex Fourier coeﬃcient of
mode (k, m). The nonlinear term is evaluated using the pseudo-spectral technique with
the 3

stencil are used. Table 1 lists the size of the computational domains and the resolution
at all Reynolds numbers considered in this study.

3. Speed statistics

3.1. Initial transients of the front speed

At each Reynolds number, data from about 20 runs are collected. At the beginning of
each run the speed of the turbulent fronts undergoes an initial transient t0 which increases
with Re (Nishi et al. 2008). In our simulations periodicity is imposed in the axial direc-
tion, which typically allows for longer observation times than in experiments for slowly
expanding slugs, but shorter times for rapidly expanding slugs. Hence in simulations it is
more convenient to determine the structure length L0 at which the front speed saturates
instead of the time t0. In order to collect accurate statistics the ﬂow domain must be

considerably longer than L0. The speed measurements are stopped when the structure
length is 15-20 diameters shorter than the pipe so to avoid artiﬁcial interactions between
the upstream and downstream fronts (eventually the two fronts meet and the pipe is full
with turbulence).

Figure 3 shows the front speed as a function of the length of the turbulent region.
At low Re = 2400 there is no measurable dependence on length because the intrinsic
large ﬂuctuations of the downstream front speed mask any initial transients. However,
for Re (cid:38) 3000 the downstream front accelerates as the slug grows, and the saturation
length increases signiﬁcantly with Re (L0 (cid:39) 30 at Re = 3000, 75 at Re (cid:39) 4000, and
110 at Re = 5500). Note that the upstream front speed saturates immediately after
the initiation for all Reynolds numbers considered, whereas Nishi et al. (2008) observed
transients for both fronts. Potential reasons for this discrepancy are the development of
the Hagen-Poiseuille base ﬂow in experiments, which is absent in our DNS, and diﬀerences
in the initial disturbance used in the two cases.

3.2. Speed PDFs

After the initial transients have faded front speeds continue to ﬂuctuate. This can be
seen in the error bars of Fig. 3, which show the standard deviation of the speed, as
well as in the probability density functions (PDF) of Fig. 4. The PDFs of the upstream
front are symmetric about the mean and are very similar at all Reynolds numbers, with a
tendency toward smaller ﬂuctuation as Re increases. On the other hand, the PDFs of the
speed of the the downstream fronts are much broader than those of the upstream fronts,
indicating much larger ﬂuctuations in speed. The PDF is widest at about Re = 2400
because of the erratic downstream front resulting from puﬀ-puﬀ/puﬀ-slug interactions
and intermittency (see Hof et al. 2010; Moxey & Barkley 2010; Samanta et al. 2011; Avila
& Hof 2013, for details of the laminar-turbulent dynamics in this regime), whereas for
Re (cid:38) 2800 slugs tend to grow more continuously. As Re increases further, the downstream
front PDFs become narrower, implying that the downstream front tends to become more
similar to the upstream front. This will be revisited in Sec. 4.

downstream front, which are plotted in Fig. 5(a). The same binning is used for all Reynolds
numbers and the ruggedness in PDFs of the downstream front speed is due to the small sample
size (20 runs per Reynolds number).

when N is large, the mean front speed can be approximated by < ¯ci > and 1.96σ/

gives the 95% conﬁdence interval for the mean, where σ is the standard deviation of the
sample {¯ci}. This conﬁdence interval is shown as error bars in Fig. 5(a), which shows
the scaling of the front speed with respect to Reynolds number. Overall a smooth but
complex speed curve for the downstream front is observed. Two changes in the curvature
can be seen in the downstream front speed curve, which are due to the adjustment from
weak to a strong downstream fronts as pointed out by Barkley et al. (2015).

The expansion rate of turbulent domains, i.e. the diﬀerence between the speeds of the
downstream and upstream fronts, as a function of the Reynolds number was used by
Sreenivasan & Ramshankar (1986); de Lozar & Hof (2010) in an attempt to characterise
the onset of fully turbulent ﬂow as a phase transition. Our extensive data show that the
expansion rate increases approximately linearly from Re (cid:39) 2300 to 3200 (see Fig. 5(b)),
and the linear ﬁt gives an approximate “critical” Reynolds number of Re (cid:39) 2250 for
expanding turbulence. If ﬁtted with a square-root function using all data above Re =
2300, the ﬁt would give a “critical” Reynolds number of about 2400, which is clearly much
higher than the onset of turbulence growth observed in our DNS. On the other hand, if
ﬁtted with a power law assuming the “critical” Reynolds number 2250, a growth exponent
about 0.63 would be obtained. However, neither of them ﬁt the data well (see blue and
green lines in Fig. 5(b)), illustrating that simple scalings as suggested in the literature
(Sreenivasan & Ramshankar 1986; de Lozar & Hof 2010) do not properly capture the
transition between localised and expanding turbulence.

seen as trajectories in the (u, q)-phase plane. Filled circles correspond to the bulk of slugs. The
two red arrows corresponds to those two in Fig. 6 and distinguish the upstream front (the solid
arrow) from downstream front (the dashed arrow). Phase-space trajectories were obtained as
averaged over long-time simulations and over multiple runs (typically 20) at each Re.

4. Characterisation of front types

4.1. Fronts in the u-q phase space

As proposed by Barkley (2011); Barkley et al. (2015) the turbulence intensity (here q)
and the centreline velocity (u) provide a convenient and compact characterisation of the
state of the ﬂow. When the proﬁle is fully developed laminar ﬂow q = 0 and u = 2,
while a lower value of u indicates a more plug-like velocity proﬁle, and hence lower
shear in the turbulence core. In our analysis a turbulent slug is divided in three parts:
upstream front, bulk, and downstream front (see Figure 6), and the relation between q
and u is computed separately in these three regions. In order to remove the eﬀect of
ﬂuctuations and determine the average dynamics of the fronts, results are averaged over
all time instants and runs. Figure 7 shows the resulting phase-space trajectories in the
(u, q)-plane for several values of Re. A traverse starting from the upstream parabolic
laminar ﬂow, through the turbulent slug, and then back to downstream parabolic ﬂow
corresponds to a closed loop in the (u, q)-phase plane.

Starting from the parabolic laminar ﬂow on the upstream side, there is a sharp increase
in turbulence intensity q across the upstream front while the centreline velocity u remains
almost unchanged (see Fig. 7). This is as expected since the modiﬁcation of the mean
shear must respond to the turbulent ﬂuctuations. This rise in q occurs both for slugs
and for puﬀs. For slugs, the rise is larger and steeper (u decreases by less than 5%, in
agreement with the measurements of Wygnanski & Champagne (1973)), while for puﬀs
the rise is a bit more moderate (see the cyan curve in Fig. 7). Following this sharp
jump in q, the centreline velocity u decreases in response to the high level of turbulence
excitations (q hardly changes, see the almost horizontal crest of the solid lines). q then
gradually levels oﬀ in the bulk part of the structure. In the bulk, the stable levels of q and
u indicate that turbulence production and dissipation are in balance and the values of u
and q are the same as obtained in simulations of a pipe entirely ﬁlled with turbulence.

While the behaviour of the upstream front does not vary much with Re, the behaviour
of the downstream front does. At Re = 2800, q decreases almost monotonically from the

bulk region towards zero at the downstream side of a slug. After the drop in q, u slowly
recovers under vanishing q and the ﬂow approaches the parabolic laminar ﬂow. Following
Barkley et al. (2015), we refer to this type of front as a weak front, and a slug of such a
downstream front as a weak slug. In contrast, for slugs at Re (cid:38) 3200, the shape in the
phase plane is similar to that of an upstream front. Here q does not drop directly from
the bulk, rather it ﬁrst shoots upward to a much higher level while u slightly increases,
followed by a sharp drop to a very low level beyond recovery. It eventually vanishes,
while u slowly recovers in the absence of q or at very low level of q. Eventually the ﬂow
relaxes to the parabolic laminar state. This type of front is referred to as strong front
(the upstream front is always a strong front). In the colourmap of turbulence intensity as
shown in Fig. 1, strong fronts manifest as high intensity red stripes, whereas weak fronts
don’t.

It should be noted that as Re increases, q overshoots more sharply across the down-
stream front (from laminar to turbulent side), and the slope of the curve q(u) tends
to become identical with that at the upstream fronts. Therefore, the downstream front
becomes more and more similar to the upstream front. From the trend shown in the
ﬁgure, one can speculate that the downstream front will gradually become the mirror
image of the upstream front as Re increases further. In fact, Wygnanski & Champagne
(1973) measured the shape of these two fronts of slugs above Re = 4200 in z-r physical
space and showed that they are roughly the same. Strictly weak and strong fronts in the
asymptotic limit (sharp front limit) have been predicted in the model study of Barkley
et al. (2015). Although in real pipe ﬂow absolutely sharp fronts cannot be realised, the
structure of these two fronts in our DNS closely resemble that predicted by the model (see
Fig. 7), and especially the front speed from DNS perfectly agrees with the asymptotic
speed from the model (see Barkley et al. 2015).

4.2. Dynamic switch between weak and strong fronts

The above description of the fronts is based on long time and ensemble averages. How-
ever, the ﬂuctuations that are smoothed out by averaging are nevertheless intrinsic to
turbulence and can result in strong deviations from the average behaviour. Our simu-
lations show that in fact signiﬁcant changes in the dynamics of the downstream front
of slugs can occur during the evolution of a single turbulence structure. The space-time
plot of Fig. 8(a) depicts this complex behaviour of a slug at Re = 3000, which switches
between weak and strong downstream fronts. In Fig. 8(b) the speeds of these two forms
of front are plotted on the speed diagram and they almost perfectly lie on the weak and
strong speed asymptotics predicted by the theory of Barkley et al. (2015). The front
transiently takes one of the two forms and as a result the average speed sits between the
speeds of these two types of front (the red symbol at Re = 3000 in Fig.8(b)). The same
behaviour is also observed at Re = 2800, as shown by the short speedup (the red stripe)
in the downstream front in Fig. 1(b).

While the analysis by Barkley et al. (2015) does not capture the instantaneous dynam-
ics which are strongly inﬂuenced by statistical ﬂuctuations, it well captures the average
front speed and demonstrates that the downstream front speed is regulated by the two
asymptotics as shown in Fig.8(b) (dotted lines), which is responsible for the complex
curvature changes in the front speed curve (see Fig.5(a) and Fig.8(b)).

5. Fronts in the frame moving at the bulk turbulent advection speed
In parallel shear ﬂows the advection is coupled with the turbulent dynamics. Locally,
the advection speed of turbulence has been shown to depend on the size of the turbulence

structures (Del ´Alamo & Jim´enez 2009) and distance from the wall (Pei et al. 2012).
In ﬂows with two spatially extended dimensions, such as channel and Couette ﬂows,
advection is possible in the spanwise and streamwise directions (Barkley & Tuckerman
2007; Duguet & Schlatter 2013). Pipe ﬂow is comparatively simple and can be eﬀectively
modelled as a one-dimensional system (Barkley et al. 2015), but in order for models to
capture the dynamics of fronts in a qualitatively correct manner it is necessary to quantify
how rapidly turbulence is advected by the mean ﬂow. Recently, Kreilos & Eckhardt
(2014) proposed a method to deﬁne and remove the mean advection speed of turbulence
in parallel shear ﬂows. Express the Navier-Stokes equations as,

according to their method, the advection speed c can be formulated as

∂tu(r, θ, z, t) = f (u(r, θ, z, t), t).

The advection speed as deﬁned in equation (5.2) is calculated at several Reynolds num-
bers in the range Re ∈ [2600, 6000] using simulations in a short periodic domain (Lz (cid:39) 6)
fully ﬁlled with turbulence. Results are shown in Fig. 9(a), where the error bars represent

the standard deviation. The advection speed and the ﬂuctuations decrease with increas-
ing Re. The former is as expected because in wall units the domain becomes larger as
Re increases. In the model of Barkley et al. (2015) it was assumed that turbulence is
advected nonlinearly at a speed lower than the centreline velocity, and that their diﬀer-
ence is constant. This speed lag is an essential feature and strongly inﬂuences the overall
front speed scaling of the model. Surprisingly, our simulations conﬁrm that this simple
assumption is actually correct (see Fig. 9(b)).

Note that the advection speed just considered applies to homogeneous ﬁelds, e.g., the
bulk region of slugs and fully turbulent ﬂow. However, for ﬂows with turbulent fronts,
the advection speed is spatially dependent, because the local turbulence production and
diﬀusion levels are very diﬀerent in the bulk region of slugs and at the fronts. Diﬀusion
is (on average) vanishingly low in homogeneous regions, while it is signiﬁcant at fronts
and its interplay with turbulence production at the fronts determines the front speed
(Wygnanski & Champagne 1973).

5.2. Advection speed and front speed

The comparison between the advection speed and the front speed is shown in Figure 8(b).
For Re (cid:46) 2900, the advection speed of turbulence in the bulk region of slugs is higher
than both upstream (blue triangles) and downstream fronts (red triangles), whereas it
sits between the speed of upstream and downstream fronts for Re (cid:38) 2900.

It is particularly enlightening to view expanding turbulent structures (slugs) in the
frame of reference co-moving with the advection speed. As shown in Fig. 10, in such a
frame of reference, the structures in the bulk of slugs overall stay still, while the fronts
move. At low Re, both the upstream and downstream front move to the left and the
upstream front moves faster (see Fig. 10(a) for an example at Re = 2800). Hence, this
suggests that production outweighs dissipation of turbulence, and in fact a direct calcula-
tion of production and dissipation rates at the strong front by Wygnanski & Champagne
(1973) showed that the former is an order of magnitude higher than the latter. In con-
trast, the downstream front moves into turbulence, implying that relaminarisation occurs
at the downstream front although the weak slug expands in length. In other words, the
dissipation dominates there on average. At high Re, the upstream front moves to the
left and the downstream front moves to the right and features a strong peak in q (see

age dominates at both fronts. This strong correlation between front speed and turbulence
intensity can also be seen in the colourmap of Fig. 8: the strong front is red (high q),
whereas the weak front is yellow. From our argument it could thus be inferred that the
transition between weak and strong fronts should occur at Re ≈ 2900. Our data support
this argument and indeed below 2900, weak fronts are (statistically) more likely to occur,
while strong fronts dominate above 2900.

6. Discussion and conclusion

Using extensive direct numerical simulations, we studied the propagation and struc-
ture of laminar-turbulent fronts in pipe ﬂow over a wide range of Reynolds numbers
Re ∈ (1900, 5500]. Our results are in line with the conclusions of the seminal experimen-
tal studies of Wygnanski and co-workers (Wygnanski & Champagne 1973; Wygnanski
et al. 1975), and provide a bridge between their analysis of the physics and the recent
theoretical model of Barkley et al. (2015). The structure of the upstream front remains
qualitatively unchanged over the whole Reynolds number range and its dimensionless
speed monotonically decreases as Re increases. The downstream front speed is identical
to the upstream front speed below Re (cid:39) 2250 (puﬀ regime) and then increases smoothly,
marking the onset of turbulence expansion (slug regime). The expansion rate of turbu-
lence is shown to increase roughly linearly in the regime 2300 (cid:46) Re (cid:46) 3200, diﬀering from
the square-root scaling as suggested by Sreenivasan & Ramshankar (1986) and de Lozar
& Hof (2010). The front speed and growth rate also do not show any scaling that would
be expected at a directed-percolation phase transition (Sipos & Goldenfeld 2011).

Close to onset of expanding turbulence the downstream front of slugs is weak, i.e. con-
sisting of a gradual relaminarisation toward the parabolic ﬂow proﬁle as seen in puﬀs.

turbulent intensity are found to dominate. Weakly and strongly expanding slugs can be
clearly seen in previous experimental work (e.g. Nishi et al. 2008) and the distinction
was ﬁrst noted by Duguet et al. (2010). A model analysis in the limit of sharp fronts
gives a theoretical foundation for the distinction Barkley et al. (2015). In this paper, we
investigated the structure of the fronts in real pipe ﬂow and observed slugs with front
structure that closely resembles the model predictions (see our Figure 7 and Figure 2 of
Barkley et al. 2015).

Based on a comparison between the advection speed of turbulence in the bulk of slugs
and the speed of fronts, our study reveals the physical distinction between the weak and
strong fronts. For Re (cid:46) 2900 the downstream front travels slower than the turbulent
advection speed and so in the co-moving frame, turbulence relaminarises (dissipation
dominates) at the weak front. In contrast, for Re (cid:38) 2900 the downstream front travels
faster than the bulk addition speed of turbulence and so it can aggressively invade the
laminar ﬂow ahead, while extracting energy from it. In the intermediate regime around
Re (cid:39) 2900, ﬂuctuations, which cause rise or fall in the strength of turbulence pro-
duction/dissipation, may cause temporal switching between the two types of front (see
Fig. 8). Overall, the adjustment from weak to strong fronts results in the complicated
speed curve of the downstream front up to Re (cid:39) 3500 . At higher Reynolds numbers the
downstream front becomes rather similar to the upstream front (in line with the mea-
surements of Wygnanski & Champagne 1973) and strongly invades the laminar ﬂow on
the downstream, which is the reason for the symmetric speed curves at high Re. It can
be expected that at very high Reynolds numbers the upstream and downstream become
asymptotically equal.

Holzner et al. (2013) devised a Lagrangian approach to calculate the local instan-
taneous propagation speed of the three dimensional complex fronts, and to evaluate
the contributions from diﬀerent mechanisms. They applied this method to a puﬀ at
Re = 2200 and showed that local relaminarisation and transition to turbulence occurs
simultaneously at either the upstream or downstream front, however, in diﬀerent re-
gions (at diﬀerent radial positions). It can be speculated that the competition between
these two processes at a front determines its overall behaviour. If relaminarisation re-
gion outweighs the turbulence production region, then an overall relaminarising (weak)
front should be present, and vice versa. This is in line with our argument in this paper.
We used the cross-sectionally integrated quantities (q) to determine the fronts, which
to certain extent takes into account the three dimensional eﬀects to directly obtain the
overall behaviour. The approach of Holzner et al. (2013) however requires extremely high
resolutions for accurate enstrophy calculation and three dimensional interpolation from
the grid points to the fronts. Currently it is too expensive to be employed to slugs at
higher Reynolds numbers.
