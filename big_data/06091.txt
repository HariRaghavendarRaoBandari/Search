Abstract

In order to solve the ﬁne-tuning problem of the cosmological constant, we propose a simple model

with the vacuum energy non-minimally coupled to the inﬂaton ﬁeld. In this model, the vacuum

energy decays to the inﬂaton during pre-inﬂation and inﬂation eras, so that the cosmological

constant eﬀectively deﬂates from the Planck mass scale to a much smaller one after inﬂation and

plays the role of dark energy in the late-time of the universe. We show that our deﬂationary

scenario is applicable to arbitrary slow-roll inﬂation models. We also take two speciﬁc inﬂation

potentials to illustrate our results.

INTRODUCTION

It is well-known that there exist two accelerating expansions in our universe. One occurs

at the very early time of the universe, solving particularly the ﬂatness and horizon problems,

called “Inﬂation” [1–4], and the other is at the late-time, indicated by the type-Ia supernovae

observations [5, 6], called “Dark Energy.” The former epoch can be realized by introducing

the inﬂaton ﬁeld with a slow-roll potential. For the latter, various theoretical models have

been proposed to achieve the late-time acceleration universe [7], while the simplest one is

to keep the cosmological constant, Λ, in the gravitational theory, referred to as the ΛCDM

model. However, if Λ is originated from the vacuum energy, it is associated with the Planck

mass as predicted in particle physics, which is about 10120 orders of magnitude larger than

the current measured value. This “ﬁne-tuning” or “hierarchy” problem in fact was known

even before the discovery of dark energy [8].

There have been many attempts to solve the hierarchy problem [9]. One of the popular

ways is the running Λ model, in which the vacuum energy decays to matter [10–16] or a

quintessence ﬁeld [17] in the evolution of the universe, and its observational tests have been

extensively investigated in the literature [18–22]. In this study, we concentrate on a simple

model with the vacuum energy non-minimally coupled to the inﬂaton ﬁeld, in which the

coupling may arise from the conformal transformation, i.e., transforming the Brans-Dicke

theory from the Jordan frame to the Einstein one [23–28]. It is interesting to mention that

the inﬂaton coupled to the vacuum energy can be used to realize inﬂation with a small

coupling constant [29].

In our model, the vacuum energy begins with the Planck mass scale and deﬂates by

decaying to the inﬂaton in the pre-inﬂationary and inﬂationary epochs. The non-minimal

coupling between the inﬂaton and vacuum plays the role of heating up the inﬂaton and

triggers inﬂation, whereas inﬂation itself is driven by another slow-roll potential. After the

reheating era, the inﬂaton decays to matter and decouples to the vacuum energy. As a result,

the residual vacuum energy density is much smaller than the matter one after inﬂation. At

the late-time of the universe, the vacuum energy is dominated again, known as dark energy.

In this scenario, the energy diﬀerence between the Planck mass and current cosmological

constant scale is determined by the inﬂaton potential and the coupling constant between

the vacuum energy and inﬂaton ﬁeld. We will show that the allowed range of the coupling

2

constant is insensitive to the choice of the potentials so that our deﬂation scenario for Λ is

quite general.

This paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II, we introduce the model with the vacuum

energy non-minimally coupled to the inﬂaton ﬁeld. In Sec. III, we calculate the analytical

solution and estimate the range of the coupling constant. In Sec. IV, we use two speciﬁc

potentials to check our analytical results. We present our conclusions in Sec. V.

II. NON-MINIMALLY COUPLED VACUUM ENERGY AND INFLATON

We start from the Brans-Dicke action with the vacuum energy [27],

By varying the action (4) with respect to the metric and specializing to the FLRW case

with gµν = diag(−1, a2, a2, a2), we obtain,

ρφ =

2 − V (φ) ,

(7)

while ρv and Pv are the energy density and pressure of the vacuum, respectively. Note that
the vacuum energy equation of state (EoS) satisﬁes the relation, wv ≡ Pv/ρv = −1. If we
take the conformal transformation coeﬃcient A2(φ) in Eq. (4) to be,

A2(φ) = e−2λφ/Mp ,

with λ being the model parameter to be determined, the inﬂaton ﬁeld and the continuity

respectively. Thus, the vacuum energy can be solved as the function of φ from Eq. (10),

ρv(φ) = ρΛoe−4λφ/Mp ,

(11)

where ρΛo is the vacuum energy density after the Big Bang. Consequently, the inﬂaton ﬁeld

equation in Eq. (9) becomes

where the combined potential is given by

Vtot(φ) = V (φ) + Veﬀ(φ)

with Veﬀ(φ) = ρΛoe−4λφ/Mp.

III. ANALYTICAL ESTIMATIONS WITH GENERIC POTENTIAL

In Eq. (8), we consider λ > 0, so that the vacuum energy decays to the inﬂaton ﬁeld

in the pre-inﬂation and inﬂation eras. After the reheating epoch, the inﬂaton decays to

standard model particles, and the vacuum energy decouples to the inﬂaton ﬁeld. As result,

energy and slow-roll potential, respectively.

the original cosmological constant Λo at the Planck mass scale is deﬂated to the current

small measured value of Λde. Explicitly, we have

ρv(φm) = ρΛoe−4λφm/Mp = ρΛde ,

(14)

where φm is the minimum of the inﬂaton potential V (φ), and ρΛde ∼ 10−120ρΛo is the current
dark energy density. From Eq. (14), we get

(15)

In Fig. 1, we illustrate the potential V (φ) as a function of the inﬂaton φ, where the solid,

dashed and dotted lines correspond to the combined potential Vtot, the eﬀective potential

Veﬀ and the slow-roll potential V (φ) in Eq. (13), respectively. The evolution history can be

divided into the following four stages.

(i) the epoch of the vacuum energy decay

At this ﬁrst stage, the vacuum energy decays to the inﬂaton and turns into the kinetic

energy.

In this period, the growth of the inﬂaton φ1 (see also Fig. 1), depending on the

coupling constant λ, is determined by the relation,

ρv(φ1) = ρΛoe−4λφ1/Mp = M 2

p M 2

(16)

where Minf is at the inﬂation scale. Taking Minf = 1012 GeV and Mp = 1019 GeV, we

= −

(17)

which is much smaller than φm in Eq. (15).

(ii) the fast-roll pre-inﬂationary epoch.

In this stage, the universe is dominated by the “hot” inﬂaton, and the energy ﬂow from

the vacuum energy to the inﬂaton becomes negligible. By substituting Eqs. (5) - (7) into
Eq. (12) with ˙φ2 ≫ V (φ), we have

(19)

in this stage. The inﬂaton energy decreases from the Planck scale to the inﬂation scale at

the end of (ii), indicating that

ρv(φ2)

ρΛo

= a−3(1+wφ)

≃ 10−14 ,

(20)

which gives the e-folding N2 ≡ ln a2 ≃ 5.4. Combining N2 with Eq. (18), we ﬁnd that the
stage (ii) is terminated at φ2/Mp ≃ N2 × φ′/Mp ≃ 13.2.
(iii) the slow-roll inﬂationary epoch.

In this epoch, inﬂation is triggered and the evolution of the universe depends on the
inﬂation model. We can roughly estimate the growth of the inﬂaton ∆φ3 = φ3 − φ2 by
taking the slow-roll condition,

¨φ + 3H ˙φ +

Clearly, it is reasonable for us to have the estimation of

φ′

(23)

in this stage. As a result, the growth of the inﬂaton is ∆φ3/Mp . 9 by taking N = 60 during

inﬂation. We note that the allowed ∆φ3, depending on the speciﬁc inﬂation model, can be

bigger, but the order of magnitude should be the same. By considering various reasonable

parameters, we take

(iv) the reheating epoch

∆φ3

(24)

Here, ∆φ4 = (φm − φ3) is also model dependent. We assume that the potential can be
expressed as V |φ→φm∼ φ2 around the potential minimum. If we take ǫ|φ3= 1 as the condition
at the end of inﬂation, we can deduce that ∆φ4/Mp = (φm − φ3)/Mp ∼ √2.

As a result, φm is added up by the growth of φ from (i) to (iv), given by

14.6 . φm/Mp = (φ1 + ∆φ2 + ∆φ3 + ∆φ4)/Mp . 32.6 .

(25)

From Eqs. (15) and (25), we can roughly estimate the allowed range of the coupling constant

λ to be

2.1 . λ ≃

69Mp
φm

. 4.7 .

(26)

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS WITH SPECIFIC POTENTIALS

To check our estimations in Sec. III, we present the numerical evaluations with two speciﬁc

slow-roll potentials:

V (φ) = V0(cid:16)1 − e√ 2
V (φ) = m2 (φ − φm)2 .

,

(27)

(28)

Note that the ﬁrst potential in Eq. (27) can be obtained from the Starobinsky’s R2 inﬂation

model [1] after the conformal transformation from the Jordan to Einstein frame.

In Fig. 2, we demonstrate the evolution of the slow-roll parameter ǫ ≡ − ˙H/H 2 as a
function of φ with the potential in Eq. (27) and λ = 3.59. From the ﬁgure, we can see the

evolution behavior of φ from the stage (i) to (iv). Note that we have taken that inﬂation
occurs at ǫ|φ2= 1 and ends up at ǫ|φ3= 1, while the mass hierarchies are Minf /Mp = 10−7
and ρΛcc/ρ(0)

v = 10−120.

In Fig. 3, we use λ = (3.59, 3.65, 3.55), which are represented by the solid, dashed
p = 10−14, corresponding to the inﬂation energy
and dotted lines, respectively, and V0/M 4
at 1012 GeV. In Fig. 3a, we plot the φ evolution in terms of the e-folding N = ln a, and
we can observe that inﬂation occurs at φ2 ≃ 13.5 and ends up at φ3 ≃ 18, which ﬁt our
predictions of φ2 = 13.2 and ∆φ3 . 18. Fig. 3b shows the e-folding N versus the normalized

p

is the Planck time, and the corresponding e-foldings are

N = 60.9, 46.5 and 73.2, respectively. The ﬁgure indicates that the e-folding N is one-to-one

correspondence to the coupling constant λ.

We now examine the large ﬁeld inﬂation potential V (φ) = m2φ2 [4] in Eq. (28) with

m = 1012 GeV. In Fig. 4, we plot the evolutions of (a) φ and (b) N = ln a as functions of

N and t/t0, respectively. In the ﬁgure, we choose λ = (2.50, 2.75, 2.25), denoted by solid,

dashed and dotted lines, respectively. From Fig. 4a, we ﬁnd that inﬂation happens and
ends up at (φ2, φ3)/Mp ≃ (11.5, 26.0) with N = 60, resulting in ∆φ3 ≃ 14.5, which is
the same order as our expectation. As shown in Fig. 4b, the corresponding e-foldings are

N = 65.0, 45.3 and 93.5, respectively, which also illustrate the one-to-one correspondence

to the coupling constant λ.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have proposed a deﬂationary cosmological constant model to understand the hierar-

chy problem, in which the vacuum energy non-minimally couples to the inﬂaton ﬁeld. In this

model, the energy diﬀerence between the Planck mass and the current scale of the cosmolog-

ical constant is determined by the non-minimal coupling constant λ and the inﬂaton at the

minimum of the potential φm. These two parameters are no longer to be unreasonable huge

(or small), so that the hierarchy problem can be resolved. Explicitly, we have estimated

9

that the allowed range of λ and φm are around 2.1 . λ . 4.7 and 14.6 . φm/Mp . 32.6,

which depend mildly on the inﬂation models. Our results have also been supported by the

numerical calculations of the two popular slow-roll potentials.
