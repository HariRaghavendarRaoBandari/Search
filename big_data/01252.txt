We review the recent progress in our understanding of the Blazhko eﬀect in RR Lyrae
stars.

1 Introduction

RR Lyrae stars are low-mass, typically metal poor, Population II stars. In the HR di-
agram, they are located within the so-called classical instability strip. Their apparent
large-amplitude brightness changes are due to oscillation in the radial modes: radial
fundamental mode (RRab stars) or radial ﬁrst overtone mode (RRc stars). Simulta-
neous pulsation in these two radial modes is also possible (RRd stars). As excellent
distance indicators, RR Lyrae stars are invaluable in studies of the Galactic structure
and evolution.

RR Lyrae stars are considered a textbook examples of simple, single-periodic radi-
ally pulsating stars. In fact, they are much more complex and display phenomena that
are not well understood. Recent analyses of top-quality ground-based and space-based
photometry revealed that additional low-amplitude variability, attributed to nonra-
dial modes, may be common, at least in RRc stars – see e.g. Szab´o et al. (2014);
Moskalik et al. (2015); Netzel et al. (2015); for recent review, see Moskalik (2014).
Another puzzling eﬀect, the Blazhko modulation, was discovered more than hundred
years ago (Blaˇzko, 1907). It manifests as a quasi-periodic modulation of pulsation
amplitude and/or phase. Its cause remains a mystery. These proceedings are focused
on recent progress in our understanding of the Blazhko phenomenon.

2 Blazhko eﬀect: new discoveries from the ground-based and space-based

observations

Blazhko eﬀect is one of the most stubborn problems of stellar astrophysics. Many
eﬀorts are devoted to study the phenomenon, both on observational side and on
theoretical side. Until recently, the observations were limited to the ground-based
only. RR Lyr, eponym of the class and a Blazhko variable, was a target of multi-site
campaign (Kolenberg et al., 2006). Many Blazhko variables were discovered in the
data gathered by the photometric sky surveys such as OGLE (e.g., Mizerski, 2003;
Soszy´nski et al., 2011a) or MACHO (e.g. Alcock et al., 2003). Excellent observations,
allowing detailed study of the light curve changes during the Blazhko cycle, were
collected by the Konkoly Blazhko Survey (e.g., Jurcsik et al., 2008; S´odor et al., 2011).
These observations also revealed that the Blazhko phenomenon might be common,
at least in RRab stars, as it was detected in nearly 50 % of RRab stars for which
high-quality photometry was gathered (Jurcsik et al., 2009).

Recently, with the advent of space telescopes, CoRoT and Kepler, our knowledge
about the Blazhko eﬀect signiﬁcantly increased. Nearly continuous and long-term
monitoring of few tens of RR Lyrae stars revolutionized our knowledge about the
Blazhko eﬀect. CoRoT observed 6 Blazhko variables, Kepler, in its original Cygnus
ﬁeld monitored for 4 years, observed 18 Blazhko stars (not all stars were observed
for 4 years). CoRoT is no longer functional. Kepler’s capabilities are limited, after a
failure of its two reaction wheels. It continues the mission as K2, and has observed
tens of RR Lyrae stars, but these observations are limited to 90 days and are of
slightly lower precision than in the original mission (initial results were published by
Moln´ar et al., 2015). The 24 Blazhko stars observed by CoRoT and by Kepler in its
original ﬁeld, will serve as a benchmark for Blazhko studies in the coming years. In
Tab. 1 we summarise the basic properties of these stars together with references to the
original papers. The most important ﬁndings are summarised below. The progress
on theoretical side is reported in Sect. 3.

Incidence rate of the Blazhko phenomenon. The incidence rate is certainly
very high, at least for RRab stars. Top-quality ground-based observations and ob-
servations of the space telescopes indicate, that the incidence rate is around 50 %.
The reader is referred to the in-depth analysis by Kov´acs (2015), in particular his
tab. 1. The data are much more scarce for RRc stars; these stars were not extensively
observed from space yet. Incidence rates are clearly smaller; those reported in the
analyses of ground-based data are below 10 % (Nagy & Kov´acs, 2006; Mizerski, 2003).
Period doubling eﬀect. This is the most intriguing phenomenon detected
thanks to space observations.
It is illustrated in Fig. 1 with the help of Kepler
data for RR Lyr, in which the eﬀect was discovered ﬁrst (Kolenberg et al., 2010).
It manifests as alternating maxima and minima of the pulsation cycles in the light
curve. In the frequency spectrum, signals close to half-integer frequencies, i.e. close to
(2n + 1)/2νF (n = 0, 1, 2, . . .; νF – frequency of the fundamental mode), are detected.
In-depth study was done by Szab´o et al. (2010). Detailed analysis of the CoRoT and
Kepler data (Benk˝o et al., 2014; Szab´o et al., 2014) revealed the phenomenon in 14
in ∼58 % of Blazhko stars observed from space. These stars are marked
stars i.e.
with ‘PD’ in Tab. 1. We note that sometimes the eﬀect is very weak. In some cases
however, amplitude of the alternations may be as large as 0.1 mag; the eﬀect should
be easily detected from the ground. It was not, due to unfortunate pulsation period
of RR Lyrae stars, typically around 0.5 d, which prevents observation of consecutive
pulsation cycles from (typically a single main site on) Earth.

The term ‘period doubling’ may be misleading in the context of Blazhko variables.
Period doubling eﬀect is well known dynamical phenomenon that occurs in type-II
Cepheids (e.g., Soszy´nski et al., 2011b; Smolec et al., 2012). In these stars, the al-
ternations are permanent (although pulsation, in particular of RV Tau stars, may be
irregular) and hydrodynamic models indicate that they may represent the ﬁrst step
in the period doubling route to chaos (e.g. Kov´acs & Buchler, 1988). In the frequency
spectrum, additional signals are centered exactly at the half-integer frequencies. This
is not the case for Blazhko RR Lyrae stars. The eﬀect is observed only at some phases
of the modulation cycle; its nature is intermittent. In the frequency spectrum, the
additional signals are not centered at (2n + 1)/2νF, but signiﬁcant oﬀset is sometimes
present, as already reported by Szab´o et al. (2010) or Benk˝o et al. (2014) and also
analysed by Bryant (2015a). For these reasons, Kov´acs (2015) suggests to call the
eﬀect ‘amplitude alternation’ rather than period doubling. We note that Szab´o et al.
(2010) conducted some simulations and showed, that the intermittent nature of the

phenomenon may lead to the appearance of complex structures in the frequency spec-
trum close to half-integer frequencies. In these structures, the highest peaks are not
necessarily centered at (2n + 1)/2νF.

With the help of hydrodynamic modelling, Koll´ath et al. (2011) were able to
produce the period doubling eﬀect in non-modulated RR Lyrae models (so far the
Blazhko-like modulation was not reproduced in models of RR Lyrae stars, Smolec,
2015b) and traced its origin to the 9:2 resonance between the fundamental mode
and the ninth overtone (which is a surface mode, trapped in the outer model layers).
This result, and lack of the phenomenon in the non-modulated RR Lyrae stars (Nemec
et al., 2011; Szab´o et al., 2014), motivated a new model behind the Blazhko modulation
(Buchler & Koll´ath, 2011, see next Section).

based observations allows one to detect periodicities of very low amplitude, even well
below 1 mmag.
Indeed, the frequency spectra of Blazhko variables observed from
space contain many additional signals beyond the fundamental mode frequency and
its harmonics, kνF, and multiplet structures centered at kνF. In the low-frequency
range a signal corresponding to the modulation frequency (and its harmonics) is often
detected. Signals located close to (2n + 1)/2νF are attributed to period doubling
phenomenon. Instrumental frequencies and their combinations are also common in
the data, hence, careful analysis of signals at unexpected locations is always needed.
Other signals detected in the frequency spectrum fall into two categories: those that
can be attributed to radial modes (to the ﬁrst or to the second overtone) and those
that can not. In Tab. 1 stars with such signals are marked with ‘1O’/‘2O’ or with ‘nr’,
respectively. Additional radial modes are recognized based on characteristic period
ratios. In particular, for the second overtone, which is detected in Blazhko variables
very often (17 stars in Tab. 1, ∼ 70 % of the sample), we have P2O/PF≈ 0.58−0.595. In
several stars additional periodicities with Px/PF around 0.7 were detected and initially
identiﬁed as corresponding to ﬁrst overtone or to nonradial modes. Benk˝o & Szab´o
(2014) showed, that in the majority of cases, these frequencies can be interpreted as
linear combinations of radial mode frequencies (F and 2O) and radial mode and half-
integer frequencies. This is the case for e.g., V360 Lyr and V354 Lyr (1O detection
claimed in Benk˝o et al., 2010), and V1127 Aql (nonradial mode detection claimed in
Chadid et al., 2010; Szab´o et al., 2014), in which additional signals in the frequency
spectrum can be interpreted as linear combination 2(ν2O−νF) (Benk˝o & Szab´o, 2014;
Benk˝o et al., 2014). Detection of the ﬁrst overtone is claimed in only 2 stars.
In
other two stars signiﬁcant unidentiﬁed frequencies were reported (marked with ‘nr’ in
Tab. 1). We stress that amplitude of the additional signals (including 2O) is always
very low and sometimes complex structures are present in the frequency spectrum
(close double, or multiple peaks, see ﬁg. 6 in Benk˝o et al., 2014).

Two stars deserve more attention. V350 Lyr and KIC7021124 were ﬁrst regarded
as non-modulated stars (Benk˝o et al., 2010; Nemec et al., 2011). Presence of the
second overtone in their frequency spectra, motivated Benk˝o & Szab´o (2015) to search
for the Blazhko modulation. After reanalysis of its photometric data and analysis of
the light curves and O−C diagrams, the Blazhko eﬀect was indeed detected (these
stars are reported in Tab. 1). At the moment, none of the nonmodulated RRab stars
observed from space, shows additional periodicities. Hence, Benk˝o & Szab´o (2015)

concluded that additional modes appear only in the presence of the Blazhko eﬀect.

Modulation patterns. Multiperiodic modulation. Among Blazhko stars a
variety of modulation patterns are observed. For nice visualtization of space observa-
tions the reader is referred to ﬁgs. 4 and 6 in Szab´o et al. (2014) and ﬁg. 4 in Benk˝o
et al. (2014). Modulation periods range from a few days to more than thousand of
days. Typically, both pulsation amplitude and pulsation phase are modulated. Modu-
lation amplitudes cover a wide range. Thanks to space observations, tiny modulations
were revealed (V350 Lyr and KIC7021124). Modulation may be fairly regular and
single-periodic as is the case of V1104 Cyg. Nice examples are also known in the
ground-based observations, the reader is referred to on-line gallery at:

http://users.camk.edu.pl/smolec/blazhko/

However, with the precision of space photometry, multiperiodic and irregular modu-
lation is rather a rule. Strong irregularities are not rare. Well studied examples are
CoRoT id 105288363 (Guggenberger et al., 2011) or RR Lyr, in which secondary 4 yr
modulation is postulated [Detre & Szeidl (1973), see also Kolenberg et al. (2011)].
At the end of regular Kepler observations, the Blazhko eﬀect vanished in the star
(Le Borgne et al., 2014). The apparent diﬀerences in consecutive modulation cycles
may also result from multiperiodic modulation. Two modulations are not rare and
are detected both in ground-based observations (e.g., S´odor et al., 2011; Skarka, 2013,
B (cid:44)akowska & Smolec, these proceedings) and are detected with Kepler (Benk˝o et al.,
2014, Tab. 1). In the space data, secondary modulations were often revealed or con-
ﬁrmed with the help of O−C analysis. Benk˝o et al. (2014) noted that ratio of the
modulation periods is often close to the ratio of small integers. Similar example in the
ground-based observations is reported e.g.
in S´odor et al. (2011). Another interest-
ing feature is presence of sub-harmonics of the modulation frequency, i.e. signiﬁcant
peaks at νBL/2 in the low frequency range, and peaks separated by νBL/2 at the
fundamental mode and its harmonics. It is reported in Kepler stars (Benk˝o et al.,
2014), in ground-based observations (e.g. S´odor et al., 2011), and in modulated RRd
stars (Smolec et al., 2015, Sect. 4).

3 Models proposed to explain the Blazhko phenomenon

Several models were proposed to explain the Blazhko phenomenon. Some of them
are rather ideas, as they lack rigorous physical description. Testing of the models
faces a basic diﬃculty: we still lack realistic, 3D models that could correctly describe
turbulent convection present in the envelopes of RR Lyrae stars and could describe
the nonlinear interaction between the radial modes, and radial and nonradial modes.
The amplitude equation formalism, that is often invoked, relies on several parameters
(saturation and coupling coeﬃcients) that are very diﬃcult to compute. Nevertheless,
some models could be ruled out on observational and/or theoretical grounds. Below
we just provide the list of models with some basic description and refer the reader to
original papers for more details. For extensive review and critique of the early models
(ﬁrst three in the list below) the reader is referred to the review by Kov´acs (2009).
• Magnetic oblique rotator/pulsator model, proposed by Shibahashi (2000). Re-
quires strong dipole magnetic ﬁeld which is not detected (e.g. Kolenberg & Bagnulo,
2009). Also, the model predicts strictly periodic modulation and symmetric quintu-
plet structures in the frequency spectrum. To the contrary, observed modulation may
be strongly irregular. In the frequency spectrum, asymmetric multiplets are observed
in stars with the top-quality photometry.

Rados(cid:32)law Smolec

• Resonant nonradial rotator/pulsator model, see e.g. Nowakowski & Dziembowski
(2001). Modulation is due to rotational splitting of nonradial (cid:96) = 1 modes that are
in 1:1 resonance with the fundamental mode. The model predicts strictly periodic
modulation and symmetric triplets in the frequency spectrum which, as noted above,
is not the case.
• The idea by Stothers (2006): variable magnetic ﬁeld aﬀects the eﬃciency of
envelope convection and causes the modulation of pulsation. The idea lacks rigorous
elaboration. For recent critique of this idea see Smolec et al. (2011) and Moln´ar et al.
(2012a).
• 9:2 radial mode resonance model, proposed by Buchler & Koll´ath (2011). Ac-
cording to this model the 9:2 resonance between the fundamental mode and the ninth
overtone, which is claimed to be responsible for the period doubling eﬀect (Koll´ath
et al., 2011), may also cause modulation of pulsation. This conclusion is based on
the analysis of amplitude equations. The resulting modulation may be quasi-periodic
or chaotic. We lack realistic hydrodynamic calculations conﬁrming the hypothesis,
although similar mechanism (3:2 resonance) may work in hydrodynamic BL Her-type
models (Smolec & Moskalik, 2012).
• Atmospheric shocks’ dynamics as a cause of the Blazhko eﬀect – a model pro-
posed by Gillet (2013), based on analysis of monoperiodic, radiative hydrodynamic
models. It is not clear how a transient ﬁrst overtone, crucial in this model, develops
in a single-periodic fundamental mode model.
• Nonresonant radial-nonradial mode interaction, e.g. Cox (2013), recently devel-
oped by Bryant (2015b). Assumes excitation of two modes, radial and nonradial, of
nearly the same frequency, that are not phase-locked. Model based on simple analyt-
ical considerations. We lack tools that allow realistic study of radial-nonradial mode
interaction in nonlinear regime.

4 Blazhko eﬀect in double-mode RR Lyrae stars

Recently, the Blazhko eﬀect was discovered in the double-mode RR Lyrae stars pul-
sating simultaneously in the radial fundamental and ﬁrst overtone modes (RRd). Few
stars were identiﬁed in the OGLE-IV Galactic bulge data by Soszy´nski et al. (2014).
Additional stars and detailed analysis of the OGLE sample of Blazhko RRd stars
(15 objects) was conducted by Smolec et al. (2015). Another four variables of the
same type were identiﬁed by Jurcsik et al. (2014) in their observations of the glob-
ular cluster M3. The most striking feature of these stars, which we illustrate in the
Petersen diagram in Fig. 2, is atypical period ratio. In this plot, the majority of RRd
stars form a tight progression; the period ratio increases from 0.725 to 0.746 with the
increasing pulsation period, up to PF ≈ 0.52d. Then, a mild decrease of the period
ratio with the increasing period is observed. Most of the modulated stars, marked
with large open symbols, are beyond this progression. Still, models show that the two
dominant periodicities can be easily explained as corresponding to two radial modes
(Smolec, 2015a). In some of the stars, only one radial mode is modulated. In other
stars, two modes are modulated, but sometimes modulation period is diﬀerent for the
fundamental mode than for the ﬁrst overtone mode [see tab. 2 in Smolec et al. (2015)
and tab. 1 in Jurcsik et al. (2014)]. In the OGLE sample, modulation properties are
commonly nonstationary. Also pulsation amplitude and phase of the radial modes
may strongly vary on a long time scale of a few hundred days. An extreme case is
OGLE-BLG-RRLYR-13442, which switched the pulsation mode from RRab to RRd

during the OGLE monitoring (Soszy´nski et al., 2014). Needless to say, the mechanism
behind the Blazhko modulation in RRd stars remains a mystery.
