In this paper, based on lectures by the authors at the May 2015 workshop Resurgence, Physics and
Numbers, at the Centro di Ricerca Matematica Ennio De Giorgio of the Scuola Normale Superiore
in Pisa, we explain the origin of resurgent trans-series in the Mathieu equation spectral problem,
using uniform WKB and all-orders (exact) WKB. Exact quantization conditions naturally arise,
and their expansion in the weak coupling regime produces resurgent trans-series expressions which
exhibit precise relations between diﬀerent instanton sectors.
Indeed, the perturbative expansion
encodes all orders of the multi-instanton expansion, an explicit realization of the general concept of
“resurgence”. We also discuss the transition from weak to strong coupling, an explicit realization
of “instanton condensation”.

INTRODUCTION

A. Some Motivation from Physics and Mathematics

Asymptotic analysis is a cornerstone of physics, providing accurate expansions when certain dimensionless combina-
tions of physical parameters are large or small. Such expansions are often divergent, and these divergent expansions
contain a wealth of information, in addition to giving numerically accurate estimates in the appropriate limiting
regimes. The modern mathematical theory of resurgent asymptotics, based on Borel-Ecalle summation, is based on
trans-series expansions, in which formal (divergent) series expansions in a small parameter are extended to trans-series
expansions that also include summations over exponentially suppressed non-perturbative terms, as well as possible
summations over powers of logarithms [1–5]. While this mathematical theory arose from quite abstract origins, it now
appears that it is surprisingly well suited to many problems in physics. For example, in the language of quantum ﬁeld
theory, multi-instanton calculus is a trans-series expansion, involving a sum over an inﬁnite set of non-perturbative
multi-instanton sectors, each of which is multiplied by a ﬂuctuation series, and some of which are multiplied by
series of logarithms, due to quasi-zero modes.
In another context, it is well known in physics that summation of
classes of Feynman diagrams often leads to series in powers of logarithms. From the physics perspective, the primary
new idea from the formal theory of resurgence is the notion that there should generically be precise relationships
between the ﬂuctuations about diﬀerent non-perturbative sectors, including the vacuum sector (“perturbation the-
ory”). Viewed from the path integral, this is quite unexpected. In these lectures we explain in simple terms how
this type of structure arises, using the classic example of instantons in the quantum spectral problem for the periodic
cosine potential, known in mathematics as the Mathieu equation [6–11]. Using various forms of WKB, extended to
all orders, we show how the trans-series structure arises. In the process, we ﬁnd that not only is there a natural
underlying trans-series, but there are concrete quatitative relations between diﬀerent instanton sectors. Indeed, in an
extreme manifestation of resurgence, we show that all orders of the trans-series are encoded in a subtle way in the
divergent perturbative expansion itself. Here we explain what we mean by this somewhat dramatic claim. We use
the language of the underlying diﬀerential equation, but these conclusions are even more interesting when translated
into the path integral formalism. We propose that these ideas could in fact be used as a means to provide a sensible
mathematical deﬁnition of the path integral, even in Minkowski space, and moreover a deﬁnition that provides also
a means of making quantitative computations. One of the primary motivations is that in many physics applications
it would be desirable to have better control over the analytic continuation of path integrals, for example for studying
real-time processes, quantum transport, or ﬁnite density systems. One of the main mathematical advantages of a
trans-series, compared to just an ordinary divergent series, is that the trans-series is designed to encode the proper
analytic continuation properties of the function it is describing. This sounds appealing, but it is a notoriously diﬃcult
problem in path integrals, so we are motivated to understand as much of this trans-series structure as possible, in a
well-deﬁned concrete example. That is the purpose of these lectures.

The study of resurgent trans-series in quantum spectral problems began with the pioneering work of Bogomolny
and Fateev, and Zinn-Justin, Br´ezin, Parisi, Voros et al [12–17] (for an excellent review see [18]), as well as in the
mathematical literature from the work of Pham, Ramis, Dillinger, Delabaere, Berry, Howls, Aoki, Takei et al [19–24].
It also became clear from the work of Kruskal and Costin and co-workers, that resurgent asymptotic analysis is a

2

powerful tool in studying the asymptotics of nonlinear diﬀerential equations [3, 24, 25]. More recently, in physics,
Mari˜no, Schiappa and Weiss showed that the resurgent approach yields interesting new insights in the study of matrix
models and string theory [26, 27]. Since then there has been a ﬂourishing activity involving applications in matrix
models, string theory, quantum gauge theory and sigma models, as well as new results in quantum mechanics [28–39].
In these lectures, our goal is quite modest: study a well-known and widely relevant system, the Mathieu equation,
and understand it in great detail. Surprisingly, through the eyes of resurgence we are able to see new results in this
very old problem.

Two further pieces of motivation are the following general questions:
• What can weak coupling analysis tell us about strong coupling ?
• Can weak coupling and strong coupling be related, even if the degrees of freedom re-organize themselves in a

very non-trivial way, for example across a transition ?

We will be able to phrase these questions more precisely in the context of the Mathieu system, and see that resurgent
asymptotic analysis provides precise answers.

B. Resurgent trans-series in quantum spectral problems

In this paper we concentrate on trans-series expressions for energy eigenvalues in certain quantum mechanical

spectral problems, more speciﬁcally the Schr¨odinger equation for the periodic cosine (Mathieu) potential.

(1)

This is an example of a more general class of quantum mechanical (QM) spectral problems with potentials having
degenerate harmonic minima.
In these cases it is known that standard Rayleigh-Schr¨odinger perturbation theory
leads to a perturbative series that is not only divergent, but also Borel non-summable, in the sense that the expansion
coeﬃcients grow factorially fast in magnitude and do not alternate in sign [13, 14, 40–43]. Thus, naive Borel summation
leads to a non-perturbative imaginary part for the energy, which moreover is ambiguous. This is doubly problematic:
not only is it ambiguous, but these systems are stable, and therefore the energy should be real.
(Contrast with
the case of a cubic oscillator [44], or an inverted-double-well quartic oscillator [45], where the system is unstable
and the imaginary part has a natural physical interpretation.) The resurgent trans-series expression for the energy
resolves these apparent inconsistencies, because the perturbative series is only one part of the full trans-series, and the
ambiguous imaginary non-perturbative term arising from Borel summation of perturbation theory is exactly cancelled
by a corresponding term in a higher non-perturbative sector. Resurgence implies that these cancellations occur to
all orders, leading to a full trans-series that is not only real, but also unambiguous. This means that perturbation
theory on its own is incomplete, while the full trans-series is complete. For a clear and exhaustive analysis of how
these cancellations occur for general real trans-series we refer the reader to [46].

In the context of the Mathieu equation, consider performing perturbation theory within one of the potential wells,
perturbing about the N th energy level of the unperturbed harmonic well, leading to a perturbative expression of the
form

upert(, N ) =

nun(N )

(2)

∞(cid:88)

n=0

Notice that the system can be scaled in such a way that the sole parameter in the equation is , and the “semiclassical
limit” of small  refers to the situation where the potential wells are deep. (See Section II A below.) The perturbative
coeﬃcients un(N ) are simple polynomials in the level number N , and can be computed by straightforward iterative
procedures. For potentials with degenerate harmonic minima, the perturbative expansion (2) is not Borel summable,
which means that on its own it is incomplete and indeed inconsistent. This is true not just for the ground state
(N = 0), but also for higher states, so long as N (cid:28) 1/, as discussed in more detail in Section V below. This
situation can be remedied by recognizing that the full expansion of the energy at small coupling is in fact of the
“trans-series” form:

(3)

Perturbation theory corresponds to the “zero-instanton sector”, k = 0, with coeﬃcients c0,n,0(N ) ≡ un(N ). The
higher (k ≥ 1) instanton terms of the trans-series involve a sum over non-perturbative factors exp[−k S/], multiplied

3

by prefactors that are themselves series in  and in ln(1/). Note that the sum over logarithms in (3) begins in the
k = 2 sector: physically, these logarithms arise from the interaction between instantons and anti-instantons, which
requires k ≥ 2.
The basic building blocks of the trans-series, , exp[−S/] and ln(1/), are called “trans-monomials”, and are
familiar from physical examples. The parameter S in (3) is a numerical constant, the single-instanton action. With
our choice of scaling of the Mathieu equation, S = 8 [see equation (13) below]. Remarkably, the expansion coeﬃcients
ck,n,l(N ) of the trans-series are intertwined amongst themselves, in such a way that the ‘necessary’ cancellations occur
in order to render the full trans-series real and unambiguous. In practice, this works as follows: a Borel analysis of
the perturbative series requires an analytic continuation in , producing non-perturbative imaginary parts, but these
are precisely cancelled by the imaginary parts associated with the ln(−1/) factors in the non-perturbative portion
of the trans-series. Similarly, the ﬂuctuations about the single instanton sector, given by the coeﬃcients c1,n,0, are
also divergent, and Borel summation of these ﬂuctuations produces new imaginary parts, but these are cancelled by
terms in the k = 3 sector. And so on. Ambiguities only arise if you look at just one isolated portion of the trans-series
expansion, for example just the perturbative part, or just some particular multi-instanton sector. When viewed as a
whole, the analytic continuation of the trans-series expression is real, unique and exact.

An important ﬁrst step in our argument is a seemingly small and innocent shift of emphasis from much of the previ-
ous work studying the divergence of perturbation theory in quantum spectral problems, which has often concentrated
on low-lying energy levels or bands, such as the ground state or lowest band. In order to see the full structure of
the trans-series it proves useful to consider the spectral energy eigenvalue not just as a function of the small coupling
(which we can take here as : see the scaling deﬁned in Section II A below), but also of the level or band number,
N , an integer that labels the perturbative energy level or band. The fact that there exists such a label is physically
clear for problems with degenerate harmonic minima, corresponding just to the unperturbed harmonic oscillator level
number. Mathematically, it is clear from oscillation theorems for Sturm-Liouville type problems in one dimension.
Thus we view the energy eigenvalue u in (1) as a function of two variables:

u = u(, N )

(4)

This immediately deﬁnes three interesting, and quite distinct, spectral regions:

1. N (cid:28) 1: weak coupling, far below the barrier
2. N ∼ O(1): intermediate coupling, near the barrier top
3. N (cid:29) 1: strong coupling, far above the barrier

Note that even the physical language used to describe the diﬀerent spectral regions is very diﬀerent. In the weak
coupling region the states are described as superpositions of localized atomic states in the so-called “tight-binding
approximation”, while at strong-coupling the states are more naturally treated as using the “nearly-free electron”
picture of weakly perturbed free states [47]. Near the barrier top, neither of these approximations is satisfactory, and
there is a complicated re-arrangement of degrees of freedom, a concrete realization of the phenomenon of “instanton
condensation” [48–52]. Correspondingly, the expansions of the energy in these three regions are quite diﬀerent, and
yet they are all related. One of the main motivations of this work is to understand in more precise detail how this
transition from weak- to strong-coupling occurs. In particular, we are motivated by the close analogy to so-called
“large N ” technqiues in quantum gauge theories and matrix models [53].
So far, the discussion sounds somewhat trivial. But the new result that we wish to describe is that by considering
the dependence of u(, N ) on both  and N we ﬁnd that there is a direct quantitative relation between perturbation
theory and the all-orders multi-instanton trans-series expression. For example, one explicit consequence of this
relation is a dramatically improved description of the one-instanton sector.

New Result for Mathieu Spectrum [54, 55]: The leading exponential (“one-instanton”) splitting of the N th
band in the weak-coupling regime where N (cid:28) 1 can be written, including the series of ﬂuctuations,

This result (5, 6) agrees with the ﬂuctuation series derived from the asymptotics of Mathieu functions [57], and also
with a recent 3-loop computation for N = 0 [58], as discussed below in Section IV C. The interesting new thing
in (5, 6) is that the ﬂuctuation series Pinst(, N ) is expressed solely in terms of the perturbative ﬂuctuation series
upert(, N ). Thus, there is a direct relation between the ﬂuctuations about the zero-instanton sector (i.e., perturbation
theory, upert(, N )), and the ﬂuctuations about the one-instanton sector, Pinst(, N ). This is an explicit example of
resurgence, quite diﬀerent from the early term/late term relations that have been studied previously.
The ﬁrst factor in (6), ∂upert/∂N , is a density-of-states factor that is well known at leading order in  [66, 67], but the
remaining exponential factor in (6) is new [54, 55]. Similar relations can be derived expressing the ﬂuctuations in any
higher-instanton sector exactly in terms of the ﬂuctuations about the zero-instanton sector (i.e., perturbation theory).
Furthermore, there are similar results for other potentials [54, 55]. This is remarkable:
it says that perturbation
theory, u(, N ), encodes everything! One simply has to know how to decode this information.

In Section II we review basic known facts about the Mathieu spectrum. In Sections III - V we illustrate and derive
the results (5, 6) in the context of the Schr¨odinger equation for these quantum mechanical systems, but the result is
even more interesting when interpreted in the language of the path integral approach to the same spectral problem,
as discussed in Section VI. This is in fact our main motivation, as we wish to develop a deeper insight into the general
structure of semiclassical expansions, having in mind potential applications to quantum ﬁeld theory.

II. BASIC FACTS ABOUT THE MATHIEU SPECTRUM

Here we summarize the basic classic results concerning the spectrum of the Mathieu equation (see e.g. [6–11, 57]).

A. Notation and Scaling

The Mathieu equation describes the nonlinear oscillator problem, and has a wide array of applications [9, 11]. We
write the Mathieu equation in the Schr¨odinger equation form (1), but by simple changes of variables, this becomes
the standard textbook form of the Mathieu equation [11]:

d2ψ

dz2 + (A − 2Q cos(2z)) ψ = 0 ←→ −2

2

d2ψ
dx2 + cos(x)ψ = u ψ

(7)

(We use capital letters A and Q, rather than the conventional lower-case ones, to avoid confusion with symbols a and
q, which have special meaning in the related gauge theory discussion). So we can translate back and forth between
notations with the identiﬁcations:

Q =

A =

8 u

(8)

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

We also wish to compare with the important work of Zinn-Justin and Jentschura [42], who used yet another scaling:

ψ = EZJJ ψ ←→

ψ = (16g EZJJ − 1) ψ

(9)

Thus  plays the role of a coupling constant g:

 = 16 g

,

u = −1 + 16 g EZJJ = −1 +  EZJJ

(10)

The Mathieu system has a QM spectrum consisting of an inﬁnite series of bands and gaps (also known as regions
of stability and instability), as shown in Figure 1. Low in the spectrum the bands are very narrow, and high in
the spectrum the gaps are very narrow. The transition between these two behaviors occurs near the top of the
potential barrier, at u = 1, where the bands and gaps are of approximately equal width. These features are explained
quantitatively below, in Section V. We are particularly interested in the transition between the two extreme regions,
which occurs near u = 1, the maximum of the potential cos x.

At small , with N (cid:28) 1, we eﬀectively have far-separated harmonic wells, with high barriers between them. Then
perturbation theory in a given well, starting with the N th harmonic oscillator level, leads to the following perturbative

are shaded, with lower edges shown as solid (blue) lines, and top edges shown as solid (red) lines. The bands are separated
by regions of instability (gaps), which are unshaded. The ﬁrst 20 bands are shown. At small , the bands are exponentially
narrow, and the band location follows the linear behavior in (11). High in the spectrum, the gaps are exponentially narrow,
and the gap location follows the quadratic behavior in (16). The maximum and minimum of the potential, at u = ±1, are
shown as dotted lines. Note the smooth transition, near u ∼ 1, between narrow bands at small , and narrow gaps at large .
In this region, the bands and gaps are of equal width, and are not exponentially narrow, as discussed Section V C.

This expansion is indeed of the form of the perturbative expansion (2), where at nth order of perturbation theory, the
expansion coeﬃcient un(N ) is a polynomial of degree n in the level number N . There is an implicit assumption here
that N (cid:28) 1.

For ﬁxed N , the un(N ) are non-alternating in sign and diverge factorially fast [41, 54, 55, 57]:

(12)

This means that the perturbative expansion is Borel non-summable, and so the perturbative expression (11) must
be extended to a trans-series. The rate of divergence (12) of perturbation theory has a characteristic form, with the
factor 16 being equal to twice the instanton action, where the instanton action for the Mathieu potential is:

Physically, we interpret this as a non-perturbative single instanton term [59, 60], incuding the ﬂuctuations about the

action for the Mathieu potential in (13).

C. Strong Coupling: N (cid:29) 1

In the strong coupling regime, N (cid:29) 1, far above the barrier top, the spectral behavior is completely diﬀerent, as
can be seen immediately from Figure 1. We can probe this region by taking  large, keeping N small and ﬁxed, in
which case the gap edges are (see [11], converted to our notation):

This is the regime where the kinetic energy dominates the potential energy, so the energy eigenvalues are obtained
by perturbing around the (degenerate) free-particle-on-a-circle states, with the potential 22 cos(x) treated as a per-
turbation. The expansions (15) are convergent, with a radius of convergence that increases quadratically with the
level index N . They are conventionally expressed as continued-fraction representations of the eigenvalues, generated
by a Fourier decompostion of the gap-edge eigenfunctions, and these continued-fraction expressions are themselves
convergent [6, 8, 9, 11]. Nevertheless, despite these convergence properties, there are also non-perturbative eﬀects,
associated with the narrow splittings of the spectral gaps in this spectral region, as seen in Figure 1.
Rather than taking  (cid:29) 1 with N ﬁxed, the high spectral region could also be probed by taking  → 0 and N → ∞,
but with N (cid:29) 1 ﬁxed. This is motivated by analogous “large-N ” expansions in quantum gauge theories and matrix
models [53]. We will see that this is a surprisingly close analogy to the Matheiu spectrum. In this limit, for large level
number N (cid:29) 1/, the continued-fraction expressions for the energy eigenvalues give approximate expressions for the
energy of the N th gap as [11]:

This is an expansion in powers of (2/)4. We observe that the nth coeﬃcient has poles at certain integer values of
N ≤ n, so the expression (16) should really be interpreted as an expansion about N = ∞. We discuss this further
in Section V D. We also note that similar expansions, with coeﬃcients with analogous poles, occur in gauge theory
large-N expansions [61–63].
The strong-coupling expansion (16) does not fully describe the spectrum. It does not distinguish between the gap
edges, u(±)
N . Furthermore, the  dependence of the expansion (16) is diﬀerent from that in (15). For a given N , there
is a non-perturbative splitting of the gap, occuring at order 1/2N . Thus, as the level index N increases, the gap
splitting occurs at higher orders in perturbation theory, becoming exponentially small [11]:

Note that this has the same form as the non-perturbative eﬀects in the large-N expansion of the Gross-Witten-Wadia
unitary matrix model, in the strong coupling phase [48, 49, 62].

These strong-coupling results are very diﬀerent from the weak-coupling expressions described in Section II B. The
expansions are convergent rather than divergent, and the expansions do not appear to have a trans-series structure.
Nevertheless, we show below in Section V D that in fact a more natural way to interpret the expressions (15) is as
trans-series [64].

D. Theorems Concerning Band and Gap Widths

Here we summarize the known rigorous estimates of the widths of bands and gaps (stability or instability regions)
for the Mathieu problem. These generalize to the more general case of a periodic potential with a unique minimum
in each period.

Band-Width Theorem [Harrell [74], Weinstein-Keller [66], Connor et al [67]]: For a periodic potential

where the exponent involves the action under the barrier. For the Mathieu equation, this produces the
leading part of expression (14), as we discuss in Section V. Our new result (5, 6) reﬁnes this estimate
considerably, giving all the O() corrections, and moreover expresses these corrections entirely in terms of
the perturbative series.

Gap-Width Theorem [Dykhne [65], Weinstein-Keller [66], Connor et al [67], Avron and Simon [75]]:

where the exponent now involves the action on a cycle connecting complex turning points. For the Mathieu
equation, this produces the leading part of expression (17), as we discuss in Section V.

Note the remarkable fact that these leading expressions (18, 19) for the band width and gap width have a common
form, just with diﬀerent turning points. This will be explained in Section V. This gap-width result can also be
extended, along the lines of (5, 6) for the bands [64].

III. UNIFORM WKB FOR THE MATHIEU EQUATION

In this Section we outline our ﬁrst approach to the spectrum, which demonstrates how a trans-series expression such
as (3) arises for the energy levels, in the weak coupling regime where N (cid:28) 1. Here we outline the overall strategy and
summarize a few technical details. For further details, see [54, 55]. The resurgent structure of the Mathieu equation
system has also been studied in [56].

8

A. Strategy of Uniform WKB

Uniform WKB is a well-known approach [70–72], based on the simple idea of mapping the Schr¨odinger problem
to a known ”comparison problem”. Since the wells are harmonic, the relevant comparison problem is the harmonic
oscillator system, whose eigenfunctions are parabolic cylinder functions. The novelty of [54, 55] is that we push this
expansion well beyond the leading terms studied in [70–72], which reveals a surprising new layer of rich mathematical
structure. See [54, 55, 73] for a related approach to the symmetric double-well potential, which also has (degenerate)
harmonic minima.

The comparison mapping is achieved by making a parabolic uniform WKB ansatz for the wave-function:

1(cid:112)ϕ(cid:48)(x)

ψ(x) =

Dν

(cid:19)

(cid:18) 1√ ϕ(x)

(20)

∞(cid:88)

Here Dν is the parabolic cylinder function [6, 77], and ν is an ansatz parameter whose physical meaning will become
clear below. It is closely related to the band label N . This uniform WKB ansatz converts the linear Schr¨odinger
equation for ψ(x) into a nonlinear equation for the argument function ϕ(x), which can then be solved perturbatively.
Straightforward local analysis near the (harmonic) potential minimum leads to a perturbative expansion of the energy:

u = upert(, ν) =

nun(ν)

(21)

n=0

In the  → 0 limit, the ansatz
The coeﬃcient un(ν) is a polynomial, of degree n, in the ansatz parameter ν.
parameter ν tends to an integer N , labelling the unperturbed harmonic oscillator energy level. In fact, when ν = N ,
the expansion (21) coincides precisely with the result upert(, N ) of Rayleigh-Schr¨odinger perturbation theory in (2).
As mentioned in the Introduction, this perturbative series expression is incomplete, and indeed ill-deﬁned, because
the series is not Borel summable. This is not particularly surprising because so far the analysis has been purely local,
making no reference to the existence of neighboring degenerate minima of the potential. To determine the energy
spectrum properly we must impose a global boundary condition that relates one minimum to another.
function of both N and  [54, 55]:

This global condition implies that ν is only exponentially close to the integer N , with a small correction that is a

νglobal(, N ) = N + δν(, N )

The correction term δν(, N ) has a trans-series form:

(23)

As explained below, this trans-series structure follows directly from the properties of the parabolic cylinder functions,
and it is therefore generic for potentials with degenerate harmonic minima.
The global boundary condition determines the ansatz parameter ν as a function of  and N , as in (22, 23), and
then the trans-series form of the energy eigenvalue follows immediately by inserting this into the formal perturbative
series expansion:

utrans(N, ) = upert (, N + δν(N, )) =

nun(N + δν(N, ))

(24)

Recall that the coeﬃcients un(ν) are polynomials. We are using the fact that a formal expansion of a trans-series is
itself a trans-series.

(cid:18)

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

This uniform WKB approach explains in very elementary terms why the energy generically has a trans-series form
for potentials with degenerate harmonic classical minima: all properties of the  → 0 limit are simply mapped to
the resurgent asymptotic properties of the parabolic cylinder functions. All analytic continuations needed to analyze
questions of resurgence and cancellation of ambiguities are ultimately expressed in terms of the well-known analytic
continuation properties of the parabolic cylinder functions.

Therefore the uniform WKB ansatz (20) converts the linear Schr¨odinger equation (1) to a non-linear equation for the

Notice that the ansatz parameter ν appears in this nonlinear equation, whereas it does not appear in the original
Schr¨odinger equation. This nonlinear equation can be solved using simultaneous perturbative expansions for ϕ(x)
and u:

u = u0 + u1 + 2u2 + . . .

ϕ(x) = ϕ0(x) +  ϕ1(x) + 2 ϕ2(x) + . . .

(27)
(28)

Note that the expansion coeﬃcients un and ϕn(x) also depend on the ansatz parameter ν, simply because they come
from solving the equation (26), in which the parameter ν now appears.

1. Leading Order of the Perturbative Expansion

The leading order of (26) determines ϕ0(x) and u0:

0(ϕ(cid:48)
ϕ2

0)2 = 8(V (x) − u0)

(29)

It is notationally simpler in this case to shift the coordinate x by π so that the minimum of the potential is at x = 0.
Thus we take V (x) = − cos x. Clearly the spectrum is unchanged by this shift. Requiring regular behavior at x = 0
we determine

Replacing ν by an integer quantum number N , this expansion (35) agrees with the result (11) of Rayleigh-Schr¨odinger
perturbation theory about the N th harmonic oscillator level. But, as before, this is a formal, divergent asymptotic
expansion, which moreover is not Borel summable, so this is not the whole story. We are missing the information
about the fact that the spectrum consists of bands, not of discrete levels. This omission is because we have not yet
applied the correct physical boundary conditions.

C. Global Boundary Condition: Connecting Diﬀerent Minima

To fully determine the spectrum, we need to extend the previous local analysis, in the neighborhood of a minimum

of the potential, with global information about how neighboring minima are related.

It is well known (see Figure 1) that each perturbative level labeled by the integer index N splits into a continuous
band of states (in classical language these are the “stability regions” of the Mathieu equation). In the QM Schr¨odinger
context this phenomenon arises from the Bloch condition:

ψ(x + 2π) = ei θψ(x)

(36)

where θ is a real angular parameter that labels states within a given band of the spectrum. Conventional Floquet
analysis [6, 9–11, 76] expresses this Bloch boundary condition in terms of the discriminant. Deﬁne two independent
solutions ψ1(x) and ψ2(x), normalized as follows at some arbitrary chosen point (which we take here to be at x = −π,
the center of a barrier between two potential minima: recall that here we are taking the potential V (x) = − cos x):

(cid:18)ψ1 (−π) ψ(cid:48)

ψ2 (−π) ψ(cid:48)

(cid:19)

(cid:18)1 0

(cid:19)

0 1

1 (−π)
2 (−π)

=

Then, using the symmetry of the Mathieu potential, we can re-write the Bloch condition in the compact form [11]:

cos θ = ψ1(π)

(38)

This is the exact quantization condition, which determines the band spectrum. To make this exact quantization
condition practically useful, we need a way to evaluate the right-hand-side of (38). This can be done numerically, or
using asymptotics, as we do in this paper. The band-edge states correspond to θ = 0 or θ = π, and are periodic or anti-
periodic functions, respectively. For other values of θ the wavefunctions are quasi-periodic (see (36)), corresponding
to states within a given band. All this is very well known.

Now let us apply this global boundary condition (38) to the uniform WKB ansatz (20). First, deﬁne even and odd

functions

where we have used the fact that ϕ(x) is odd, and ϕ(cid:48)(x) is even, on the interval x ∈ [−π, π]. Then the normalized
basis functions in (37) are

ψ1(x) =

(47)

Thus, the global boundary condition is imposed at the midpoint between two neighboring perturbative vacua:
xmidpoint = π. Moreover, the global condition is expressed in terms of parabolic cylinder functions evaluated at
xmidpoint. This Bloch condition results in the perturbative energy level splitting into a continuous band, with states
within the band labeled by the angular parameter θ. The bottom of the lowest band has θ = 0 and its wave function
is an even function, while the top of the lowest band has θ = π and its wave function is an odd function. For such
band-edge states the Bloch conditions (43, 44) take a simpler form:

Using the uniform WKB ansatz (39) we ﬁnd that these band edges are determined by the exact condition:

(even state) : f− (π) = 0
(odd state) : f+ (π) = 0

Now we come to the main point. The argument ϕ(π), just like the perturbative expansion of the energy in (35), is
a Borel non-summable series in , with leading term being non-zero: ϕ0(π) = 4. Thus, as  → 0 we are interested in
the asymptotics of the parabolic cylinder functions at large magnitude of their argument. But in order to make sense
of the Borel non-summable series we must analytically continue in  oﬀ the Stokes line, the positive real axis,  > 0.
Then the argument of the parabolic cylinder functions in (47) becomes complex, and we need to use the asymptotics
of these functions oﬀ the real axis [6, 11]:

The sign here depends on which way we continue oﬀ the real axis. The ellipsis denote known ﬂuctuation terms
[6, 11, 54]. Thus, we see that the exact quantization condition for the band edges (47) requires a balance between
the two exponential terms in (48). Had we been on the real axis, we would eliminate the growing exponential in (48)
by setting ν equal to a non-negative integer, but this is just perturbation theory. Balancing the two exponentials
expresses the exact quantization condition in the following form:

Expanding about an integer, writing ν = N + δν, and the fact that ϕ2(π)
exponentially small shift in (22). The higher order terms generate powers of ln  (for further details, see [54]). Thus
we see immediately how the trans-series structure arises: inserting ν = N + δν(, N ) into the formal expansion (21,
35), we generate a trans-series expression for u, of the form (3). By construction, all analytic continuations are self-
consistent, because we have simply used the analytic continuation properties of the parabolic cylinder functions. All
higher ﬂuctuation terms can be deduced straightforwardly from the ﬂuctuations of the parabolic cylinder functions.

This resurgence procedure works because the global boundary condition is expressed in terms of parabolic cylinder
functions of 1/, and for these functions the analytic continuation properties are rigorously known. Thus, trans-series
expressions of the form (3) also arise for other potentials with harmonic minima. Ambiguities only arise if you ﬁrst
expand the global boundary condition and look at just one isolated portion of the resulting trans-series expansion,
for example just the perturbative part, or just some particular multi-instanton sector. When viewed as a whole, the
analytic continuation of the trans-series expression is unique and exact, and leads to real and unambiguous energy
eigenvalues.

IV. RELATING PERTURBATIVE AND NON-PERTURBATIVE SECTORS

A. Results of Zinn-Justin and Jentschura

We now compare with the beautiful results of Zinn-Justin and Jentschura (ZJJ) [42]. (Recall Eqs (9, 10), which
translate between their notation for the Mathieu equation and ours.) ZJJ conjectured an exact quantization condition
of the form:

where θ is the Bloch angle, and AZJJ(, E) and BZJJ(, E) are functions of energy that need to be computed. ZJJ
derived the following expansions (we rewrite the following expressions in terms of  ≡ 16g instead of g):

ZJJ showed that expanding the transcendental quantization condition (50) leads to a trans-series expression for the
energy eigenvalue, and made extensive numerical checks of the associated resurgent cancellations. We also note that
the computation of BZJJ(, E) is straightforward, while AZJJ(, E) is considerably more involved [42].

We deduce the remarkably simple relation:

16
It is straightforward to check this to higher orders in .
In other words, the non-perturbative function AZJJ(, B), and therefore also AZJJ(, E), can be deduced imme-
diately from knowledge of the perturbative energy EZJJ(, B). Thus, only one of the two functions BZJJ(, E) and
AZJJ(, E) is actually needed to generate the entire trans-series. Note that this fact is not at all obvious when these
functions are written in terms of E as BZJJ(, E) and AZJJ(, E), as in (51, 52), but become clear when everything is
expressed in terms of B, as in (53, 55). We will understand the reason for this in Section V. The implication of this
fact is that the exact quantization condition (50) involves only one function. See for example Eq. (68) in [54].

Implications and Two Independent Conﬁrmations

This relation between the AZJJ and BZJJ functions has some remarkable implications. Recall that the function
EZJJ(, B) describes the ﬂuctuations about the perturbative vacuum, while AZJJ(, B) describes the ﬂuctuations
about the single-instanton [42, 55]. For example, the single-instanton ﬂuctuation factor comes from

in agreement with the ﬂuctuation factor in (14). At ﬁrst sight, it looks from (59) as though one needs both EZJJ(, B)
and AZJJ(, B) in order to compute the ﬂuctuations about the single-instanton sector. But because of the simple
relation (58) between EZJJ(, B) and AZJJ(, B), it is enough to know just EZJJ(, B), which means just knowing
perturbation theory.

We stress that this is a completely constructive relationship. Given some number of orders of the perturbative
expansion upert(, N ) about the perturbative vacuum, from (5, 6) we can immediately write down the same number
of orders of the ﬂuctuations about the single-instanton sector. In (60) we have shown the ﬁrst few orders of this
ﬂuctuation.
Moreover, this relation between perturbative and non-perturbative eﬀects extends throughout the entire trans-series,
to all higher multi-instanton sectors [55]. They are all encoded in the perturbative series upert(, N ). Therefore, the
ﬂuctuations about the single-instanton saddle, and all other non-perturbative saddles, are precisely encoded in the
ﬂuctuations about the perturbative vacuum. This surprising result is in fact consistent with the ambitious goal of
resurgence, which claims that the expansion about one saddle contains, in principle, information about the expansions
around other saddles, provided one knows how diﬀerent saddles are connected. This connection is provided by the
exact quantization condition (38), which is itself a statement of the Bloch boundary condition [55].

At the one-instanton level, we have two independent conﬁrmations of this result. Long ago, in a truly remarkable
paper, Dingle and M¨uller computed many orders of the series corrections to the exponential band splitting, directly
from the asymptotics of the Mathieu diﬀerential equation [57]. We can compare (60) with equation (72) of [57], and
after adjusting notation (their q0 ≡ (2N + 1), and their h ≡ 2/) we see complete agreement. This comparison can
easily be carried out to higher orders.

From the physics perspective, an even more interesting comparison is to a recent direct brute-force Feynman diagram
computation of the ﬂuctuations about the single-instanton sector, to three loop order [58] (the corresponding result
has also been conﬁrmed for the double-well system [58]). Speciﬁcally, for the single-instanton expansion of the lowest
(N = 0) band, the diagrammatic computation found the ﬂuctuation factor (translated to our normalizations: their
g ≡ /8):

This diagrammatic computation involved more than 20 three-loop Feynman digrams, each involving propagators in
the presence of an instanton, and only some of these diagrams could be evaluated exactly. Hence the third coeﬃcient
is only known numerically. This ﬁeld-theoretic result should be compared with the ﬂuctuation factor in (60) with
N = 0:

We see agreement up to 7 decimal places. Considering the complexity of the Feynman diagrammatic approach [58],
compared with the simplicity of the result (6), we see that resurgence is telling us something quite novel and non-trivial
about perturbation theory. Furthermore, we note that in the diagrammatic computation, certain diagrams evaluated
to numbers involving zeta values, but these all presumably cancel in the end because the ﬁnal coeﬃcient is rational.
This is surprisingly reminiscent of such cancellations found in QFT at higher loops, a fact that has fascinating number
theoretic and combinatorial implications [78].

It is also interesting to compare the result (5, 6) with the theorems of Harrell, Weinstein-Keller and Connor et al
[66, 67, 74] listed in Section II D. These results give one part of the prefactor to leading order, namely the density of
states factor ∂u/∂N , but do not say anything about higher orders in . Presumably there is a strong theorem here
awaiting a more rigorous proof.

V. ALL-ORDERS WKB ANALYSIS OF THE MATHIEU EQUATION: ACTIONS AND DUAL ACTIONS

There is another, complementary, WKB approach to this problem, often called “exact WKB”, or “all-orders WKB”
[24]. While the uniform WKB approach has the advantage that it explains straightforwardly where the trans-series
structure comes from in the weak-coupling spectral region, the all-orders WKB has an advantage that it can easily
describe both high and low energy, and even energies near the top of the barrier. There is also an interesting connection
to low energy beahvior of certain supersymmetric quantum ﬁeld theories [38, 80–86].

We begin with Dunham’s all-orders WKB action [77, 87]:

where the contour integral encircles the turning points. The leading term is just the familiar WKB action. We write
this expansion as a formal series in powers of 2, with coeﬃcients that are functions of the energy u:

a(, u) =

2n an(u)

(64)

∞(cid:88)

n=0

Remarkably, the higher-order WKB actions can be obtained by acting on these leading WKB actions with diﬀerential
operators with respect to the energy u [38, 81, 82]. This follows from the fact that for V = cos(x), the numerators in
√
(63), which are given by the derivatives of V , can be re-expressed as polynomials of V . Therefore by diﬀerentiating
u − V with respect to u, and taking appropriate combinations, one can generate the integrands in (63) up to total
derivatives which vanish after integrating around the turning points. For example, at the next two orders:

d2

(cid:19)

a0(u)

(65)

(66)

In fact, a0(u) satisﬁes a 2nd-order Picard-Fuchs equation (73), so these can be further simpliﬁed, but we do not need
this fact here.

The all-orders WKB expression for the location of a narrow band or gap can be expressed as [77, 87]:

(cid:40) 1

2 N 

(cid:0)N + 1

1
2

2

(cid:1) 

a(, u) =

(gap)
(band)

(67)

This “all-orders Bohr-Sommerfeld” formula relates a complicated expression in the energy, u, and coupling, , to an
integer that labels the band or gap. This can be inverted to express the energy as a function of N and . For example,
when u ≈ −1, we can expand and invert, which leads to the perturbative expansion (11), as we illustrate in the next
sub-section. Alternatively, we can expand at u (cid:29) 1 and then invert, which leads to the strong-coupling expansion
(16), as we illustrate in the following sub-section. Expanding near the barrier top, u ≈ 1, yields information about
the spectrum in this regime.
All this is perturbative information, obtained from the formal all-orders WKB expansion (63) in powers of . But, as
is clear from the Mathieu spectrum shown in Figure 1, we are also interested in non-perturbative information related
to the width of the bands and gaps, whose central locations are given by (67). This non-perturbative information can
be extracted from the same all-orders expansion (63), but with diﬀerent contours, now encircling the other turning
points; for example, for the energy range below the barrier top, the new turning points are those associated with
tunneling through the barrier between two adjacent wells. For energies above the barrier top, these turning points
merge and go into the complex plane, and this expression continues smoothly. Thus, we write this “dual” action as

integrated over the dual integration cycle CD, which encircles these dual turning points. For the Mathieu problem
there are just two independent cycles, C and CD, and they correspond to the generators of the two cycles of the
underlying torus. Note that the higher-order WKB dual actions can also be obtained from the leading one by acting
with certain diﬀerential operators: in fact, since the only diﬀerence is the diﬀerent cycles, the relations have exactly
the same form as in (66), with an replaced with aD
n . With proper analytic continuation, this quantization condition
permits smooth transitions and dualities between the various spectral regions, connecting weak and strong coupling,
and also the bottom and top of the wells. The distinction between the various regions is encoded in the location of
the turning points in the complex plane, and the associated Stokes lines. For energies inside the wells there are real
turning points. As the energy approaches the barrier top, the turning points come together and coalesce, and move
apart again along the imaginary axis for energy above the barrier top.
Given this dual action, there is an elegant compact formula (18) for the leading width of a band, for energies well
below the potential barrier (i.e. here −1 ≤ u (cid:28) 1). In terms of the action and dual action, this leading order result
reads:

∆uband ∼ 2

∂N

e− 2π Im aD

0 ∼ 

π

e− 2π Im aD

There is also an elegant compact formula (19) for the leading width of a gap, for energies well above the potential
barrier (i.e. here u (cid:29) 1). In terms of the action and dual action, this leading order result reads:

Notice that these formula are the same! Furthermore, notice that the prefactor can be interpreted as a frequency, and
the exponential factor as a probability of tunneling through the barrier: for band widths, the tunneling is between
real turning points, but for gap widths it is tunneling between complex turning points. The energy dependence of a0
and aD
0 is very diﬀerent in the diﬀerent spectral regions, and this explains the diﬀerence between the ﬁnal expressions
(14, 17) for the Mathieu band and gap widths, even though they come from expressions with a common form.

We recognize precisely the strong-coupling expansion (16). Thus, the all-orders-WKB action a(u, ) determines the
(convergent) expansion of the location of the gap high up in the spectrum.

2. Gap Width at Strong Coupling

Despite these expressions (for the center of the N th gap) being convergent, there are still non-perturbatively small
corrections associated with the narrow gaps high in the spectrum (see Figure 1). Expanding the leading actions in
this spectral region we ﬁnd

Therefore, from (70) we obtain the gap width estimate:

in agreement with (17). Thus, the formulas (69, 70) have the correct form in both extreme limits, in one case referring
to the width of a band, and in the other to the width of a gap.

C.

Intermediate Coupling: Instanton Condensation Near the Barrier Top

Near the barrier top, where u ∼ 1, there is a transition from the divergent perturbative behavior characteristic
of the weak coupling region, to the convergent perturbative expansions characteristic of the strong-coupling region.

As is clear from the plots in Figures 1 and 2, the transition is smooth, but connecting the regions requires careful
interpretation of the various expansions. Of particular interest are the diﬀerent mechanisms by which non-perturbative
terms arise in the diﬀerent physical regions. For example, the general expressions for the exponentially narrow width
of a band (69) deep in the weak coupling region, and of a gap (70) high in the strong coupling region, are not

valid in the region in the vicinity of the barrier top, because the single-instanton factor exp(cid:2)− 2π Im aD

(cid:3) is no longer

exponentially small. Thus, the explicit expressions (14) and (17) are not accurate in this region of the spectrum.
Physically, this is a region of “instanton condensation”. This is of particular interest as it is a direct analogue of an
instanton condensation phenomenon observed in matrix models and 2d gauge theories [48–52].

It is interesting that these two diﬀerent expansions agree at u ∼ 1, but there are corrections ∼ O(), corresponding
to the band and gap widths in the vicinity of the barrier top.

The estimates in (98, 99) can be reﬁned further: the edges of the bands/gaps when u = 1 are given by (see also

[66]):

as shown in Figure 2. In this Figure, showing the bands (shaded) and gaps (unshaded), plotted as a function of the
parameter Q = 42 that appears in the Mathieu equation (7, 8), we see clearly that at one of these edges, the band
and the gap immediately above and below have equal width. Physically, this is directly related to the fact that the
discriminant can be expressed in terms of the reﬂection and transmission amplitudes [68], and the fact that at the top
of an inverted harmonic barrier the reﬂection and transmission probabilities are equal, both being 1/2 [69]. Relatively
little is known rigorously about the corrections to this behavior of the band/gap widths in this region, even though
in some sense it is the most interesting region physically [38, 66, 67]. The results of Weinstein and Keller imply that
the small  behavior for the upper band edges has leading behavior

These lines are shown in Figure 2, and we see that they do indeed intersect the upper band edges quite accurately. It
would be interesting to investigate more precisely the band and gap widths in this region.

D. Summary of Diﬀerent Behaviors of Mathieu Spectrum in Diﬀerent Regions

It is worth comparing the form of the expressions for the energy in the three diﬀerent spectral regions.
• Weak coupling: N (cid:28) 1, deep inside the wells, far below the barrier top. Here the band edge energy eigenvalues

u(±)(, N ) are expressed as a resurgent trans-series:

∞(cid:88)



(cid:21) ∞(cid:88)

n=0

dn(N )n + . . .

(104)

The ﬁrst term is the formal perturbative series, upert(, N ), which is divergent and Borel non-summable. The leading
Borel poles occur at the two-instanton location. The ﬁrst, one-instanton, exponential correction in (104) gives the
leading band width. Furthermore, the expansion coeﬃcients un(N ) and dn(N ) are explicitly related: the dn(N ) are
fully determined by the un(N ), as in (5, 6).

• Strong coupling: N (cid:29) 1, far above the barrier top. Here the gap edges are conventionally written as the
convergent expansions (15). This raises an obvious question: how can such convergent expansions smoothly connect
to the trans-series expansion (104) below the barrier top? In fact [38], one can re-write the expansions (15) in the
following suggestive form:

u(±)(, N ) =

2N 2

αn(N )

(105)

N−1(cid:88)

n=0

(cid:1)2N

(cid:0) 2

N−1(cid:88)

n=0

where the coeﬃcient functions αn(N ) and βn(N ) are rational functions of the gap label N , but have poles at the
two-instanton location. Thus the expansions truncate at n = N . Note that this has a similar form to the trans-series

21
in (104). As N → ∞, the polynomial expansions in 14 extend to inﬁnite series. Remarkably, with this re-arrangement
we ﬁnd once again that the expansion coeﬃcients αn(N ) and βn(N ) are explicitly related: the βn(N ) are fully
determined by the αn(N ). Thus, the strong-coupling expansions can also be written in a form that matches the
trans-series structure of the weak-coupling region [64].

• Transition region: intermediate coupling: N ∼ 8

π , near the barrier top. This is the instanton condensation
region, where the single-instanton exponential factor becomes of order 1, so that all instanton orders need to be taken
into account. Here, relatively little is known precisely. One concrete statement is that the bands and gaps in this
region have equal width at leading order, and this width is O(), for example as in (103).

VI. PATH INTEGRAL INTERPRETATION: STEEPEST DESCENTS AND LEFSCHETZ THIMBLES

We have used WKB techniques in the framework of diﬀerential equations to derive the new result (5, 6), which
relates higher orders of the non-perturbative trans-series expansion to the perturbative series. But the result is even
more interesting when viewed from the equivalent path integral language. Here, diﬀerent instanton sectors correspond
to diﬀerent saddle points of the path integral, and so we learn that there is a saddle point expansion of the path integral
representation of the quantum resolvent, in which the ﬂuctuations about diﬀerent saddle points are directly related
to one another. In practice, this has been conﬁrmed by the work of [58] because their diagrammatic computation
of the ﬂuctuations about the one-instanton sector is based on a perturbative expansion of the path integral about
the one-instanton sector. But the fact that this computation is so technically diﬃcult means that there should be a
simpler way to understand the ﬁnal result. We propose that this is an example where a saddle point expansion in
terms of Lefschetz thimbles can be implemented explicitly.

To illustrate the basic idea, we turn back to a zero-dimensional example, and recall the results of Berry and Howls
[19] concerning an all-orders steepest descents expansion of an ordinary contour integral. They considered a contour
integral of the form

(cid:90)

Cn

(cid:20)

1(cid:112)1/ exp

(cid:21)

− 1

 fn

I (n)() =

dz e− 1 f (z) =

T (n)()

(106)

where the contour Cn follows the steepest descent path through the saddle point zn of the function f (z). The ﬁrst
two factors on the RHS are the dominant exponential term and the Gaussian ﬂuctuation prefactor. The remaining
factor, T (n)(), is a formal series in , and represents all orders of the perturbative ﬂuctuations about this saddle
point. Physicists typically just keep the exponential and the Gaussian prefactor. Berry and Howls [19] point out
that there is a great deal of interesting information encoded in the further ﬂuctuations T (n)(). For example, under
relatively mild assumptions about the function f (z), one can show by straightforward contour deformation that the
ﬂuctuations about diﬀerent saddle points are directly related. This is a manifestation of Darboux’s theorem: the
ﬂuctuations about a given point are governed by the nearest singularity, which here is the nearest (connected) saddle
point [19]. This fact can be expressed as the following integral transform:

(cid:88)

(cid:18) Fnm

(cid:19)

(107)

where the sum is over all other saddles topologically connected to the nth saddle, and the γnm determine the orienta-
tions of the deformed steepest descent contours. Here Fnm ≡ fm − fn is the diﬀerence of the exponents at the saddle
points zm and zn. An immediate consequence of this result is that if we write the ﬂuctuation about the nth saddle as

T (n)() ∼

r

T (n)
r

(108)

∞(cid:88)

r=0

then expanding both sides of (107) we ﬁnd a relation between the ﬂuctuation coeﬃcients around saddle points zn and
zm:

Notice the universal large-order factorial divergence of ﬂuctuations, and more importantly notice that this says that
ﬂuctuations about neighboring saddles are explicitly related.

For full details see [19], but here it is more appropriate to illustrate how this works with some examples. Consider

the zero-dimensional “partition function” for the Mathieu system, writing the periodic potential as V (z) = sin2(z):

There are two saddle points: z0 = 0 and z1 = π

Comparing coeﬃcients, we see that the low-order coeﬃcients of the ﬂuctuations about the non-perturbative saddle z1
govern the large-order behavior of the ﬂuctuations about the vacuum saddle z0. Below we consider a more interesting
example where there are three saddles.

This is a general feature of a wide class of ordinary exponential integrals: ﬂuctuations around diﬀerent saddles
are quantitatively related.
In studying path integrals, and especially semiclassical multi-instanton expansions of
path integrals, we often motivate our formal manipulations by analogy with steepest descents asymptotic analysis
of ordinary integrals. Thus, it is a reasonable question to ask whether or not something like this could possibly
occur for (inﬁnite dimensional!) path integrals. This leads to the theory of inﬁnite dimensional Morse Theory
and Lefschetz thimbles. Even the generalization from a one-dimensional integral to a multi-dimensional integral
introduces interesting and highly non-trivial eﬀects [88–91]. There are many more subtleties in going from ﬁnite to
inﬁnite dimensions [92–94].

Instead of delving into this unresolved issue, let us illustrate what happens when you ask this question about the
Mathieu system. Here we have done the calculation without using the path integral, but we can re-interpret the
results in path integral terms. Speciﬁcally, consider the Schr¨odinger problem with periodic potential V (x) = sin2(x).
The large order growth of the perturbative expansion coeﬃcients for the ground state energy is [41]

This is the large-order growth of the ﬂuctuation about the vacuum saddle point, for the ground state energy. Next,
we can inspect the multi-instanton trans-series expansion for the same physical quantity, the ground state energy,
and look for the ﬂuctuations about the ‘nearest’ saddle point with the same quantum numbers as the perturbative
vacuum. This is the instanton/anti-instanton saddle point, and we ﬁnd [55]

Notice the correspondence of the factors appearing in these diﬀerent expansions, about diﬀerent saddles. This is very
surprising. It means that to some degree the basic resurgent relation between large-order behavior of ﬂuctuations
about one saddle and low-orders of ﬂuctuations about a neighboring saddle is indeed inherited by the path integral.
(This is not just a feature of the Mathieu system: a similar relation holds also for the double-well potential).

To emphasize that this structure could be quite general we consider a further example that has the interesting
feature of having more saddle points. Let us generalize the zero-dimensional example above, by replacing the periodic
Mathieu potential V (x) = sin2(x) by the doubly-periodic elliptic potential of Lam´e type [95]:

(115)
where 0 ≤ m ≤ 1 is the elliptic parameter. Note that this potential interpolates smoothly between the periodic
Mathieu case, V (x) = sin2(x), when m = 0 and the “Sinh-Gordon” potential, V (x) = sinh2(x), when m = 1. We
write the zero dimensional partition function as the trace over the period:

These perturbative expansions are divergent for all m, but are non-alternating for m < 1/2, and alternating for
m > 1/2. This latter fact reﬂects the duality relation: Z(|m) = Z(−|1 − m), which follows from a property of the
Jacobi elliptic function sd.

The “action” function V (z) has two diﬀerent types of non-trivial saddles, one set along the real axis and another
on the imaginary axis. Their relative distance from the vacuum saddle at z = 0 is governed by the value of the elliptic
parameter m. At the real saddle point z1 = K(m), we have the action S1 = 1
1−m , while at the imaginary saddle
at z2 = iK(1 − m) we have S2 = − 1
m . These two diﬀerent saddles can be seen in the large-order behavior of the
perturbative ﬂuctuation coeﬃcients. Numerically, by studying the large-order behavior of the expansion coeﬃicents
about z0 = 0, one ﬁnds [95]

The partition function is now an inﬁnite dimensional functional integral:

n (m) are non-alternating in sign. For m > 1

For m < 1
n (m)
alternate in sign. For m = 1
2 , S1 and S2 are equal in magnitude, and the odd terms vanish due to interference
cancellations. Thus both the real and complex saddles inﬂuence the large-order growth of the ﬂuctuations about the
trivial vacuum saddle at z0 = 0. This is an explicit example of the sum of neighboring saddles in (109).
Actually, this relation can be made even more precise [95], noting that the ﬂuctuations about the saddles z1 = K(m)
and z2 = iK(1 − m) can be written as

These expansions are remarkably similar to the zero dimensional expansions of the zero dimensional partition function

expansions are non-alternating for m < 1

2 , but alternating for m > 1
2 .

The Lam´e potential is doubly periodic, in the complex plane. This means that there are two types of instantons:
real instantons and complex “ghost” instantons. The real instantons tunnel between minima of the potential along
the real axis, while the complex instantons tunnel between saddles along the imaginary axis. The associated classical
actions are:

Then one can study the large order growth of the perturbative expansion coeﬃcients for the ground state energy and
one ﬁnds that both the real and complex instantons contribute to this large-order behavior [95]:

an(m) ∼ − 16

(SI ¯I(m))n+1 − (−1)n+1
|SG ¯G(m)|n+1

(cid:19)

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

This is remarkable.
It means that the complex instantons directly aﬀect perturbation theory, even though they
are not in the original path integral measure, which is a sum over all real paths. The close resemblance to the
resurgent structure of the zero-dimensional analogue system [see Eq. (119)] strongly suggests once more that analytic
continuation of path integrals may inherit resurgent structure.

Thus we would be tempted to deﬁne a path integral by its resurgent thimble expansion:

DA e− 1 S[A] =

Nk e− i Simag[Ak]

DA e− 1 Sreal[A]

(129)

thimbles k

Γk

where the sum over Lefschetz thimbles is the analogue of the sum over steepest descent contours, but now is a sum
over functional steepest descents contours, or thimbles. This type of expansion is purely formal, but the previous
two examples illustrate that there is some truth to it. We take this as motivation to formalize such expansions more
rigorously.

VII. CONCLUSION

In these lectures we have reviewed a number of diﬀerent approaches to the general question of resurgent asymptotic
expansions for spectral problems, using the Mathieu equation as a concrete example. We have found several interesting
new facts, which we believe motivate a more rigorous mathematical analysis of these problems. We hope we have
convinced the reader, both physicist and mathematician alike, that there are some interesting new features still lurking
in this very old problem, waiting to be made more precise. One of the main conclusions is that there is more structure
when one considers the eigenvalue u as a function of two variables, both the level/band/gap label N as well as the
coupling . This has surprisingly close analogies with “large-N ” methods in physics [53]. This also motivates the

problem of understanding better the mathematical properties of trans-series of more than one variable. The path
integral interpretation of these results, and the close relation to multi-instanton calculus for quantum ﬁeld theories
(both supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric), encourages us to reconsider more seriously the question of deﬁning
an all-orders steepest descents expansion of path integrals. Some initial work along these lines has appeared recently
[96].
