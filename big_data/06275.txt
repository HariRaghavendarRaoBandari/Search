using the hyperspherical harmonics expansion method

V. I. Kovalchuk

Department of Physics, Taras Shevchenko National University, Kiev 01033, Ukraine

Abstract

A method has been developed to solve three-particle Faddeev equations

in the conﬁguration space making use of a series expansion in hyperspherical

harmonics. The following parameters of the bound state of triton and helium-

3 nuclei have been calculated: the binding energies, the weights of symmetric

and mixed-symmetry components of the wave function, the magnetic moments,

and the charge radii.

1. Introduction

Three-nucleon problems take a special place in the nonrelativistic scattering

theory, being a key to deeper physical understanding of the structure of many-

particle nucleon systems, the processes, in which such systems are engaged, and

the very nature of strong interaction. Nowadays, there exist well developed powerful

methods for the solution of three-particle problems, the most known of which are the

Faddeev method [1-4] and the Kohn–Hulth´en variational method, the latter using a

series expansion in a basis of correlated hyperspherical harmonics [5-7]. Benchmark

calculations testify that both approaches – the variational and Faddeev ones – yield

very close results, when describing experiments on Nd -scattering [8,9]. The soluti-

on of a system of coupled two-dimensional integral equations, which is required in

the Faddeev method, is not a very diﬃcult problem for modern computers used

for the description of three-nucleon systems. However, this procedure may turn out

rather resource-consuming, when changing to systems with a nucleon number of

4 and more [10]. In recent years, analogous problems have been attracting steady

attention of theorists (see, e.g., Refs. [11-13] and the references therein). It is worth

noting that, in works by Dzhibuti [14-16], a possibility to reduce the multiplicity of

integration in the Faddeev scheme by combining the latter with the hyperspherical

1

functions method [17-19] was indicated. The equivalence of both approaches was

demonstrated earlier in Ref. [20]; namely, the use of hyperspherical harmonic basis

gave rise to identical forms of ﬁnal equations both in the Faddeev method and when

solving a three-particle Schr¨odinger equation. The “hybrid” method proposed in

Refs. [14-16] was based on the expansion of Faddeev components in the momentum

space into a series of three-particle hyperspherical eigenfunctions mutually coupled
by the Raynal–Revai unitary transformation. The bound states of triton and 9

Λ Be
hypernucleus were described [14], and the problem of continuous spectrum [15] (the

reaction of double charge exchange of kaons at triton and helium-3 nuclei) was

examined. In Refs. [21] and [22], while describing three- and four-particle bound

states, the method of hyperspherical harmonic expansion was used to solve the

Faddeev–Yakubovsky integral equations in the momentum representation. This work

aimed at studying the capabilities of hyperspherical harmonic expansion techni-

que for the solution of three-particle Faddeev equations in the conﬁguration space.

When calculating the bound state parameters, we used semirealistic nucleon-nucleon

potentials, which have been used for long in similar problems as test ones by a good

many researchers.

The structure of the paper is as follows. In Sec. 2, the general formalism used

when deriving the basic equations of the method is expounded. In Sec. 3, a special
case of the problem – a bound state of 3 H and 3 He nuclei – is considered. Here, the

approximations are substantiated, and the scheme for the calculation of expansion

coeﬃcients of the total wave function Ψ is described. In Sec. 4, the calculation

results are reported for the main characteristics of three-nucleon nuclei: the binding

energy, the charge form factors, the contributions made by the symmetric and mixed-

symmetry components of Ψ , the magnetic moments, and the root-mean-square

charge radii. At last, in Sec. 5, a short summary of the work is made.

2. Formalism

We proceed from the well-known Faddeev equations [1] written down for a system

of three strongly interacting spinless particles with identical masses m . Let particle 1

be scattered by particles 2 and 3, which are in the bound state:

Ψ(1) = Φ + G0(Z)T23(Z)(Ψ(2) + Ψ(3)) ,

Ψ(2) = G0(Z)T31(Z)(Ψ(3) + Ψ(1)) ,
Ψ(3) = G0(Z)T12(Z)(Ψ(1) + Ψ(2)) ,

2

(1)

where Ψ(1,2,3) are the one-particle wave functions, the sum of which is the total

wave function of the system,

Ψ = Ψ(1) + Ψ(2) + Ψ(3),

(2)

Φ is the asymptotic wave function that describes the inﬁnite motion of particle 1
with respect to the coupled 23-pair, G0(Z) = (Z − H0)−1
is Green’s operator,
Z = E ± i0 , E is the total energy of the system 1 + (23) , H0 is the operator of
kinetic energy, and Tij are two-particle transition operators connected with the

pair potentials Vij ( ij = 12, 23, 31 ) by means of the relations:

Tij(Z) = Vij + VijG0(Z)Tij(Z) .

(3)

Substituting Eq. (3) into Eq. (1) and summing up the equations obtained, we arrive

at the formulas [23]:

Ψ = (1 − G0(Z)V23)Φ + G0(Z)UΨ, U = V12 + V23 + V31 .

(4)

One can easy to show uniqueness of the solution of this equation. If you execute

several consecutive iterations for the Ψ , we can see that the k -th iteration, Ψk ,
will not contain terms with disconnected parts except the (G0(Z)V23)k+1Φ but this
term vanishes, in turn, on the (k+1) -th iteration, etc. Thus the whole inﬁnite series

for Ψ will contain only terms with compact kernels. Therefore, the Eq. (4) has a

unique solution.

Let us rewrite Eq. (4) as follows:

Ψ − Φ = G0(Z)U(Ψ − Φ) + G0(Z)(V12 + V31)Φ,

(5)

and expand the diﬀerence Ψ− Φ into a series of hyperspherical harmonics (see
Appendix A):

Substituting series expansion (6) into Eq. (5) and using the conditions of

Ψ − Φ =XKn

ψKn(ρ)uKn(Ω).

(6)

orthonormalization and completeness for the eigenfunctions of the radial part of

operator H0 , as well as the condition of orthonormalization for hyperspherical

harmonics, we obtain the following system of one-dimensional integral equations

for expansion coeﬃcients (see Appendix B):

ψKn(ρ) = fKn(ρ) + λXK ′n′

KK ′(¯ρ)

Rnn′

is the integral operator. The constant λ in Eq. (7) includes numerical coeﬃcients

and the nucleon mass m . The functions Q , W, and U in the integrands in Eqs. (8)

and (9) look like

Kn(Ω)U(¯ρ, Ω) uK ′n′(Ω) ,

where

ξK(ρ) =pK(K + 4)/ρ2 − 2mE, E = Ei − ǫ,

the quantities I2 and K2 in Eq. (10) are the modiﬁed Bessel functions, whereas

Ei and ǫ in Eq. (13) are the energies of incident particle and bound state in the

three-particle system ( ǫ > 0 ), respectively. Equations (7) have the most general

form. They can be solved using standard numerical routines for an arbitrary set of

hyperspherical harmonics.

The procedure used when deriving Eqs. (7) can be easily generalized to the

model, in which the wave function Ψ depends on the spins and isospins of nucleons.
In this case, the diﬀerence Ψ−Φ is expanded into a series of antisymmetric basis
states:

Ψ − Φ =XKn

ψKn(ρ)ΓKn(Ω; σ, τ ).

(14)

The states ΓKn are constructed using the hyperspherical

Kn(Ω)
characterized by a deﬁnite type of permutation symmetry [g] – antisymmetric,

functions u[g]

[a] , symmetric, [s] , and mixed-symmetry,
functions ξ[¯g]
vely (see Appendix C). For instance, in the case of bound state of three-nucleon

n (σ, τ ) with a conjugate symmetry [¯g] – [s] , [a] , [′′] , and [′′] , respecti-

[′] and [′′] , ones – and the spin-isospin

system ( S = 1/2 , T = 1/2 ), the quantity ΓKn looks like [19]

ΓKn = u[a]

Knξ[s] − u[s]

Knξ[a] + u[′]

Knξ[′′] − u[′′]

Knξ[′].

(15)

The technique used for the derivation of equations for the radial components

ψKn(ρ)

is similar to that presented above. Besides, the following additional

orthogonality relation for ξn(σ, τ ) is used:

ξ[g]†

ξ[g′] = δgg′.

Xστ

(16)

In so doing, we have also to take into account, of course, that the pair potential

contains the Pauli matrices and the spin-isospin projection operators.

3. Bound states

Let us consider the problem of the triton bound state making allowance for spin-
isospin degrees of freedom of its nucleons. The wave function of 3H can be obtained

from Eqs. (5) and (14) by putting the initial condition Φ = 0 in them. Besides, it

has also to be taken into account in Eq. (13) that Ei = 0 and the total energy E
now acquires a sense of binding energy for nnp -system: E ≡−E3 =−ǫ . Series (14)
converges rapidly [19]: the dominant contributions to Ψ are given by the partial
components ψK=0,2,4 ( n = {0000} ), whereas the contribution made by the partial
wave with K = 6 amounts to about 1% of that produced by ψ0 . Without loss of

generality, let us further assume that pair interaction is central-symmetric,

V (2s+1, 2t+1)(rij) P (2s+1, 2t+1)

ij

(σ, τ ),

(17)

Vij =Xs t

where s and t are possible values of total spin and isospin of the i -th and j -th
nucleons, and P (2s+1,2t+1)
with the multiplicity (2s+1, 2t+1) .

is the operator of projection onto the spin-isospin state

ij

Conﬁning expansion (7) to the terms with K ranging from 0 to 4 and using the

spin-isospin functions to calculate the matrix elements in the resulting system of

equations, we can ultimately write down

02 ψ2 − H (+)

are integral operators, and λ = 16m/π . The multi-indexes n and n′ are n = n′ =
{0000} in (19) and n = n′ ={1100} in (20).

The following routine was used to solve system (18). Presenting the latter in the

(20)

matrix form and zeroing the right hand sides in Eqs. (18), it is easy to verify directly

that, for the NN -potentials used in this work (see below), only the ﬁrst of the three

resulting homogeneous equations has a nontrivial solution. Therefore, the iterative

procedure becomes determined unambiguously. First, as a ﬁrst approximation, we
ﬁnd φ0 from the equation φ0 = −H (+)
00 φ0 . The nonzero solution of this equation
(the eigenfunction φ0 ) is known [24] to exist, provided that the matrix of integral
operator H (+)
00 (E) = 0 , we ﬁnd the
00
eigenvalue E , the sense of which is the binding energy of triton. Afterwards, the

is degenerate. By solving the equation det H (+)

function ψ0 determined to an accuracy of a constant factor is substituted into the

second and third equations of system (18) to ﬁnd ψ2 and ψ4 . The normalization

constant is determined from the condition

Z dxdy|Ψ|2 = PS + PS′ = 1,
PS =Z dρρ5(ψ2

PS′ =Z dρρ5ψ2

(23)

where

and

are the weights of symmetric and mixed-symmetry, respectively, components of the

triton wave function. The S - and S ′ -components combine the states with L = 0

and S = 1/2 . The small P -component ( L = 1 ; S = 1/2, 3/2 ), the contribution

of which to the normalization integral is of the order of 0.1%, was not taken into

account.

The routine used to ﬁnd the wave function and the binding energy, which was
described above, can also be applied to the 3He nucleus. In this case, the kernels of

integral operators (19) and (20) must be appended with the Coulomb term 2VC/3 ,

where VC is the Coulomb potential. Certainly, the component with isospin T = 3/2
is neglected in the 3He wave function determined from Eqs. (18) using this routine.

However, as was shown in Ref. [25], its contribution to normalization integral (21)
does not exceed 2.5 · 10−3 %.

The system of equations (18) was solved for a triton in the cases, when the

Malﬂiet–Tjon [26],

Vt(r) = (1438.72 e−3.11r − 626.885 e−1.55r)/r,

potentials are used.

The determined dependencies ψK(ρ) were used to calculate the charge form

factors of 3H and 3He nuclei [30, 31]

Fch(3H) = 2F n
2Fch(3He) = 2F p

chFL + F p
chFL + F n

chFO,
chFO,

where

FL = F1 − F2/3,
FO = F1 + 2F2/3.

(27)

(28)

In turn, the bulk form factors F1 and F2 in Eq. (28) are expressed in terms of

ψK as follows [32]:

F1(q) = 24√3Z ρ5dρ

0J2(a) − 2√3ψ0ψ4J6(a) + ψ2

a2 (cid:2)ψ2
F2(q) = 72√6Z ρ5dρ

a2 ψ0ψ2J4(a),

2(J2(a) + J6(a))(cid:3),

where a =p2/3qρ .

Using the known formula for the charge form factor at small q ’s,

Fch(q) = 1 − q2r2

ch/6 + ...

(29)

(30)

(31)

and Eqs. (27)–(30), we can obtain [32] the following expressions in the approximation
F n

ch = 0 :

ch(3H) = (rp

ch(3He) = (rp

(33)

The magnitudes of 3H and 3He nuclear magnetic moments can be calculated by

expressing them in terms of known magnetic moments of proton, µp , and neutron,

µn , and the weights of symmetric, PS , and mixed-symmetry, PS′ , components [34]:

5. Conclusions

The study of scattering processes in systems composed of three strongly interacti-

ng particles has been a subject of enhanced interest of researchers for a long time.

However, only in the ﬁrst half of the 1990s, the methods were developed, which

8

allowed high-precision calculations of observable quantities in 3N -reactions to be

carried out. The method of Faddeev equations and the method of hyperspherical

harmonics, which belong to the most known and eﬀective approaches in researching

3N -systems, are deservedly classed as such. In this work, those two approaches have

been combined together; namely, the series expansion in hyperspherical harmonics

was used to ﬁnd the solutions of Faddeev integral equations in the conﬁguration

space. The new approach takes advantage of the problem geometry directly, by

representing the solution of Faddeev equations as a series in the eigenfunctions of

the angular part of six-dimensional Laplace operator (the hyperspherical harmoni-

cs). As a result, the problem is reduced to the solution of a system of one-dimensional

integral equations valid for an arbitrary potential. From a comparison between the

results obtained and high-precision data (see Table 1), it follows that the method
proposed allows the basic characteristics of the bound state of 3H and 3He nuclei

to be described satisfactorily for the approximations and potentials used in this

work. An advantage of the method is also the circumstance that, unlike the works

by Dzhibuti [14, 15], it does not use the Raynal–Revai transformation for partial

components of hyperspherical functions, because it is the total wave function that

is expanded into a series of hyperspherical harmonics.

Now,

introducing functions (10)–(13) and taking Eqs. (B.17) and (B.18) into

account, the system of equations (B.16) can be rewritten in compact form (7).

Appendix C: Spin-isospin functions for 3H and 3He nuclei

Omitting brackets in the notation for symmetry states (15), ξ[g] ≡ ξg , let us
present the spin-isospin functions of three-nucleon system at S = 1/2 and T = 1/2

as linear combinations of spin, χ , and isospin, ζ , component products [40]:

ξs =

ξ ′ =

1
√2

√2

(χ′ζ ′ + χ′′ζ ′′),

ξa =

(χ′ζ ′′ + χ′′ζ ′),

ξ ′′ =

1
√2
1
√2

(χ′ζ ′′ − χ′′ζ ′),

(χ′ζ ′ − χ′′ζ ′′).

(C.1)

(C.2)

Here, ξs and ξa are the functions completely symmetric and completely anti-

symmetric, respectively, with respect to the permutation of any pair of nucleons;

they are basis functions for two corresponding one-dimensional representations of

permutation group for three nucleons. Besides, ξ ′ and ξ ′′ are the basis functi-

ons for a two-dimensional irreducible representation of the same group, which are

characterized by intermediate (mixed) symmetry.

The spin and isospin wave functions look like

χ′ =p2/3T ′(α2α3β1), χ′′ =p2/3T ′′(α2α3β1);
ζ ′′ =p2/3T ′′(b2b3a1),
3H : ζ ′ =p2/3T ′(b2b3a1),
3He : ζ ′ =p2/3T ′(a2a3b1),
ζ ′′ =p2/3T ′′(a2a3b1),

where

T ′ = (√3/2)[(13) − (12)], T ′′ =−(23) + [(13) + (12)]/2

(C.6)

are permutation operators (the notation (ij) stands for the permutation of the i -

th and j -th nucleons). The one-particle spin (isospin) wave functions αj and βj

( aj and bj ) correspond to the positive and negative, respectively, spin (isospin)

projection of the j -th particle.
