Abstract

Existence of a minimal measurable length and an upper bound for the momentum

ﬂuctuations are the casting reasons for generalization of uncertainty principle and then

reformulation of Hilbert space representation of quantum mechanics. In this paper, we

study the consequences of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) in the presence of

both minimal length and maximal momentum. We consider a simple harmonic oscillator

in the framework of GUP by introducing it’s energy eigenstates and energy spectrum.

Investigation of coherent states for a generalized harmonic oscillator and it’s generic be-

havior are the other topics in our study.

Introduction

It is a well-known idea that gravity may modify the uncertainty principle. Bearing the gravity

in mind, ﬁeld theory leads to an eﬀective cutoﬀ (minimum measurable length) in the ultravi-

olet energies.

In fact, since high energies have major gravitational eﬀects, they will change

the spacetime structure in the small scales [1]. Theoretically, the minimum measurable length

is proposed in various approaches to the quantum gravity such as string theory [2-6], loop

quantum gravity [7] and quantum geometry [8], which has the same order as the Planck length
(lpl ∼ 10−35m) [9-11]. In the Heisenberg uncertainty principle (HUP), one cannot measure the
momentum and position of a particulary particle with zero uncertainty, together. However,

it is possible to measure one of these observable quantities by withdrawing the corresponding

information about the other. It means that one can vanish the uncertainty in position yielding

(∆x)min = 0. But the story is changed by considering the modiﬁed uncertainty principle due to
the quantum gravity which is now called the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP). In fact,

due to the non-zero eﬀective cutoﬀ, it is not possible to set (∆x)min = 0 whenever the eﬀects
of quantum gravity become important meaning that we should replace HUP by GUP [12-26].

Moreover, Hamiltonian is changed due to GUP leading to the changes of the energy spectrum
of quantum systems. Since GUP implies (∆x)min 6= 0, one may conclude that spacetime has a
non-commutative structure in the Planck scales leading to quantize the spacetime in the Planck

scales. Therefore, one can reinterpret this cutoﬀ as the quanta of space, which is due to the

quantum ﬂuctuations of background spacetime, leading to a new representation for the Hilbert

space [27]. This new representation attracted more investigators to itself [28-30]. Moreover,

considering the Planck length as the minimum permissible length, which is independent of the

observer, changes the Special Relativity foundation that is yielding the Doubly Special Rela-

tivity (DSR) theory [31-34]. In the DSR theory, the minimum eﬀective cutoﬀ makes an upper

bound on momentum. Therefore, the Planck length inspires an upper bound for the admissible

energy in this theory. We should note that the above results are modiﬁed to the more common

situations in which the spacetime curvature is taken into account. Indeed, the spacetime curva-

ture induces a non-zero minimum to the momentum uncertainty. The non-zero uncertainty in

the position and momentum lead to retire the wave functions in the position and momentum

spaces, which are introduced in the quantum mechanics based on HUP, respectively. In order

to avoid these shortcomings, bearing the states with maximum localization in mind, one should

use the quasi-position and quasi-momentum representations and reformulate the quantum me-

2

chanics, and therefore the Hilbert space [27,35]. Our aim in this paper is investigating the

eﬀects of considering the minimal length and maximal momentum on the harmonic oscillator

and its properties. The paper is organized as follows.

In the next section, we review GUP

by considering the minimum length and maximum momentum considerations. In section 3 we

present the generalized harmonic oscillator as well as its eigenstates and eigenvalues. Coherent

states of a harmonic oscillator is presented in section 4. In addition, we study the normalization

coeﬃcient and probability distribution of the coherent states. The last section is devoted to a

summary and concluding remarks.

2 GUP with minimal length and maximal momentum

In the framework of a generalized uncertainty principle that predicts maximal observable

momentum in addition to minimal observable length, we can write [19-24,35]

∆x ∆p ≥

¯h
2

(1 − 2α < p > +4α2 < p2 >) ,

(1)

which α is the GUP parameter in the presence of the two aforesaid cutoﬀs. The above uncer-

tainty relation can be obtained from the following algebraic structure

[x, p] = i¯h(1 − αp + 2α2p2).

(2)

In this relation there is a ﬁrst order term in particle’s momentum which has its origin on the

existence of a maximal momentum, whereas the second order term in particle’s momentum

originates from the existence of a minimal length.

We can deﬁne position and momentum operators for the GUP case as

X = x

,

P = p(1 − αp + 2α2p2),

(3)

where x and p ensure the Jacobi identities, and X and P satisfy the generalized commutation

relation

[X, P ] = i¯h(1 − αp + 2α2p2).

(4)

In this case, we interpret p as the momentum operator at low energies by a standard represen-
tation in position space, pj = ¯h
i
has the generalized representation in position space as

, and P as the momentum operator at high energies which

∂

[1 − α(

¯h

∂
∂xj

) + 2α2(

¯h
i

∂
∂xj

)2] .

3

To show how maximal momentum arises in this setup, we ﬁrst ﬁnd the minimal observable
length, i.e. ∆x0 ≡ ∆xmin(< p >= 0). We can write the inequality (1) on the boundary of the
allowed region and use (∆p)2 =< p2 > − < p >2 to obtain a second order equation for ∆p,
which has the following solutions for ∆p

∆p =

∆x

4α2¯h ±s(

∆x
4α2¯h

)2 −

< p >

2α

(2α < p > −1) −

1
4α2

.

(5)

The reality of solutions gives the minimum value of ∆x as

∆xmin(< p >) = 2α¯hq1 − 2α < p > +4α2 < p >2 .

Using < p >= 0, absolutely smallest uncertainty in position (absolute minimal observable

length) can be deduced from the latter equation as

∆x0 = 2α¯h .

(6)

Due to duality of position and momentum operators, we can assume ∆xmin ∝ ∆pmax. With
this assumption, using the condition < p >= 0 in Eq. (5) and making use of Eq. (6), we have

where we will assume this result as the maximal measurable momentum in our setup.

(∆p)max =

1
2α

,

(7)

2.1 Representation on momentum space

It is to be noted that, if we assume the minimal observable length as minimal, nonzero

uncertainty in position, we have no longer a Hilbert space representation on position space wave

functions of the ordinary quantum mechanics. This is because one can not ﬁnd any physical

state which is a position eigenstate, since such an eigenstate would have zero uncertainty in

position. Therefore we must construct a new Hilbert space representation compatible with

relation (4). This representation can be achieved in a continuous momentum space. Now, in

this space, momentum and position operators have the form

P = p

,

X = (1 − αp + 2α2p2)x ,

(8)

where x = i¯h ∂

∂p . Due to the presence of the additional factor (1 − αp + 2α2p2), the scalar

product in momentum representation should be rewritten as

< φ | ϕ >= Z +Ppl

−Ppl

dp

1 − αp + 2α2p2

φ∗(p)ϕ(p) .

4

(9)

We note that appearance of the limits −Ppl to +Ppl (Planck momentum) originate from the
maximal measurable momentum, so that in the absence of this cutoﬀ the integrals must be
calculated from −∞ to +∞ [27]. In present framework, the identity operator would be modiﬁed
as

1 = Z +Ppl

−Ppl

dp

1 − αp + 2α2p2 | p >< p | .

(10)

2.2 Functional analysis of the position operator

The position operator ( X in Eq. (8) ) acting on position eigenstate in momentum space,

ϕξ(p) =< p | ξ >, gives the following eigenvalue equation

i¯h(1 − αp + 2α2p2)

∂ϕξ(p)

∂p

= ξϕξ(p) .

(11)

By solving this diﬀerential equation, we obtain the position eigenvectors in the presence of

aforesaid cutoﬀs as

ϕξ(p) = ϕξ(0) exp" − i

we can obtain the coeﬃcients ϕξ(0) as

2.3 Maximal localization

In the presence of minimum observable length, lpl = ∆x0 = 2α¯h, it is not possible to probe
distances less than Planck length. So, the notion of spacetime manifold should be revised for

the ﬁnite resolution of the spacetime points. In this manner, we are obliged to introduce the

states with maximal localization that are conﬁned up to Planck length and it is impossible to
localize them further. Now, we consider the states | ϕml
ξ > of maximal localization around a
position ξ ≥ lpl and write

< X >=< ϕml
ξ

| X | ϕml

ξ >= ξ.

(13)

5

By using the positivity of norm for each state | ϕ > in the representation of the Heisenberg
algebra, namely

k (cid:16)X− < X > +

< [X, P ] >

2(∆P )2

(P− < P >)(cid:17)|ϕ >k≥ 0,

we can deduce [27] that the state | ϕ > will be on the boundary of the physically allowed region
only it obeys

(cid:16)X− < X > +

< [X, P ] >

2(∆P )2

(P− < P >)(cid:17)|ϕ >= 0.

(14)

Using Eq. (8), relation (14) takes the form of a diﬀerential equation in momentum space as

(cid:16)i¯h(1−αp+2α2p2)

1 + 2α2(∆p)2 + 2α2 < p >2 −α < p >

2(∆p)2

(p− < p >)(cid:17)|ϕ >= 0.

(15)

By taking into account that the states of absolutely maximal localization can only be obtained

for < p >= 0, and using Eqs. (7) and (13), Eq. (15) can be solved to obtain

(16)

In ordinary quantum mechanics, we expand the states | ϕ > in the position eigenbasis {| x >}
as < x | ϕ >. But, there are now no physical states which would form a position eigenbasis.
However, there is a possibility to project arbitrary states | ϕ > on maximally localized states,
| ϕml
ξ >, to obtain the probability amplitude of maximal localization for the particle around the
position ξ. We will call the collection of these projections, < ϕml
ξ |φ >, the states ” quasi-position

wave function”

φ(ξ) :=< ϕml

ξ |φ > .

6

Using a generalization of the Fourier transformation that maps momentum space wavefunction

into quasi-position space wavefunction, we can transform a state’s wavefunction in momentum

representation to it’s quasi-position wavefunction as follows

As in ordinary quantum mechanics, one can write

ei 2ξ

(tan−1( η

)) ≡ eiKξ,

to take into account the K ≡ 2
modiﬁed wavelength for quasi-position wavefunction of physical states has the form

3 ) + tan−1( 4αp−1√7 )(cid:17) as modiﬁed wavenumber. So, the

α¯h√7(cid:16)tan−1( η

λ(p) =

πα¯h√7
3 ) + tan−1( 4αp−1√7

tan−1( η

.

)

Since α 6= 0 and p is limited to the Planck momentum, there is no wavelength smaller than λ0

λ0 = λ(Ppl) =

πα¯h√7

tan−1( η

3 ) + tan−1( 4αPpl−1

√7

.

)

(18)

Using the relation between momentum and energy, E = p2
of the momentum eigenstates as

2m , we can write the maximum energy

E(λ0) =

(19)

P 2
pl
2m

which for m ≈ Mpl, the energy of short wavelength modes will be the Planck energy, E(λ0) ≈
Epl. Note that there is not any energy divergency in λ0. This result is in agreement with
ordinary quantum mechanics and is an important outcome of a GUP formalism in the presence

of both minimal length and maximal momentum. By inverse Fourier transform of Eq. (17), we

have

which because of the integration over ξ (not p), the integration interval will be over −∞ to

can deduce the generalized form of momentum operator in the quasi-position space. Since

3 Generalized harmonic oscillator

In this section we generalize the formulation of a linear harmonic oscillator in the presence of

both minimal length and maximal momentum, and obtain the eigenvalue and eigenfunctions of

harmonic oscillator by solving the Schr¨odinger equation. According to position and momentum

(8) ) and by using them in harmonic
2 mω2X 2, time-independent Schr¨odinger equation, Hψ = Eψ,

operators in momentum space representation ( Eq.

can be written as

4 Generalized Coherent States

Within the context of classical mechanics, a physical system is described by states which

are points of its phase space. In quantum mechanics, the system is described by states which

are vectors in a Hilbert space. There exist superpositions of quantum states which have many

features (properties or dynamical behaviors) analogous to those of their classical counterparts:

they are the so-called ”coherent states”. Coherent states were introduced by Schr¨odinger in

1926 [38] while he was studying the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator system. These states

were rediscovered by Glauber [39] and Klauder [40] at the beginning of 1960s. The phrase

”Coherent States” was proposed by Glauber in the context of quantum optics. Glauber found

them while he was studying the electromagnetic correlation function. Indeed, these states are

superpositions of Fock states of quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld that, up to a complex factor,

are not modiﬁed by the action of photon annihilation operators. He also realized that these

states have the interesting property of minimizing the uncertainty Heisenberg relation. Thus,

one could say that these states are the quantum states with the closest behavior to a classical

system. Coherent states are localized wave packets in position and momentum spaces and in

time are not broadening, in fact remain coherent. Although there are many ways to construct

coherent states, in this paper we’re looking for Klauder’s approach and use the version of the

generalized Heisenberg algebra [41]. So, for constructing the standard coherent states of the

harmonic oscillator, we build a state which is an eigenstate of the annihilation operator of the
generalized Heisenberg algebra. If |λ > be a coherent state, it can be described as an eigenstate
of the annihilation operator

a|λ >= λ|λ > .

(27)

With expanding |λ > in terms of constant states |n >, we can write coherent states in the
following form

(28)

|λ >= N(λ)

λn

Nn−1!|n >,

∞

Xn=0

9

where N(λ) is the normalization coeﬃcient, by deﬁnition Nn! ≡ N0N1 . . . Nn and by consistency
N−1! ≡ 1. It is important to note that Klauder’s coherent states should satisfy the following
minimal set of conditions

I) Normalizability

II) Continuity in the label

< λ|λ >= 1,

|λ − λ′| → 0

;

k |λ > −|λ′ > k → 0,

III) Completeness

Since the aforesaid approach implies N 2

n−1 = αn − α0 and αn = εn, using Eq. (26) we obtain

Z d2λ ω(λ)|λ >< λ| = 1.

N 2

n−1 = n(2 + 5α2γ2h8α2γ2(n2 +

3
2

n + 2) + 3(n + 1)i).

(29)

To satisfy the normalizability condition and using Eq. (28), normalization coeﬃcient can be

written as

N 2(|λ|) =

1

|λ|2n

(Nn−1!)2

.

(30)

P∞n=0

Now, we can study the behavior of normalization coeﬃcient by depicting of N(|λ|) for several
values of β ≡ αγ, see Fig. 1. As the ﬁgure shows, for α → 0 (harmonic oscillator without
GUP) N(|λ|) goes to e− |λ|2

In the absence of GUP and in the ordinary quantum mechanics (α → 0), the probability

2 .

distribution of photons in a coherent state is given by Poisson distribution

P (n,|λ|) = | < n|λ > |2 =

e−|λ|
n!

|λ|n.

(31)

Now, in the presence of minimal length and maximal momentum, the probability is no longer

Poissonian, namely

P (n,|λ|, α) = | < n|λ > |2 = N 2(|λ|)

|λ|2n
(Nn−1!)2

.

(32)

In Fig. 2, the schematic behavior of the probability distribution for the GUP-corrected har-
monic oscillator is shown for several values of β. As the ﬁgure shows, for α → 0 (harmonic
oscillator without GUP) P tends to Poisson distribution.

5 Summary and Conclusion

According to the existence of non-zero uncertainty in the position and momentum, vari-

ous physical concepts need to review, which one of them is the coherence. So, in this paper,

we reviewed the formulation of the generalized uncertainty principle and also Hilbert space

representation of quantum mechanics in the presence of both minimal observable length and

maximal observable momentum. Then, we have obtained the energy eigenfunctions and spec-

trum of energy for a generalized harmonic oscillator in the context of GUP which implies the

both mentioned cutoﬀs. We showed that because of the GUP eﬀects, there is a complex mass

dependence in energy spectrum of oscillator. Afterwards, we have studied the coherent states of

the generalized harmonic oscillator. Though, there is no diﬀerence in the deﬁnition of coherent

states in the GUP framework, there are some considerable implications due to the gravitational

eﬀects. Therefore, we investigated the general behavior of normalization coeﬃcient and prob-

ability distribution in terms of GUP parameter.
