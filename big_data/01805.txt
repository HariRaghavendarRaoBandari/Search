We analyze the α-12C inelastic scattering to the 0+

2 state of 12C, the Hoyle state, in a fully microscopic
framework. With no free adjustable parameter, the inelastic cross sections at forward angles are well reproduced
by the microscopic reaction calculation using the transition density of 12C obtained by the resonating group
method and the nucleon-nucleon g matrix interaction developed by the Melbourne group. It is thus shown that
the monopole transition strength obtained by the structural calculation is consistent with that extracted from the
reaction observable, suggesting no missing monopole strength of the Hoyle state.

PACS numbers: 24.10.Eq,25.55.Ci

The 0+

2 state of 12C, the so-called Hoyle state, has inten-
sively been studied theoretically and experimentally [1–13].
Despite a rather clear understanding of its three-α structure,
the description of the Hoyle state appeared in reaction observ-
ables, the (α, α′) inelastic scattering cross section in partic-
ular, has not been achieved. It was reported in many stud-
ies [14–17] that the (α, α′) cross section theoretically obtained
with using the transition density of 12C from the ground state
to the 0+
2 state signiﬁcantly overshot the observed cross sec-
tion. This puzzle is called the missing monopole strength of
the Hoyle state [15].

In these preceding studies, however, a semi-microscopic
treatment of the distorting potential between α and 12C as
well as the coupling potentials for the excitation of 12C was
adopted. This suggests some ambiguities in the distorting and
coupling potentials that connect the structural information and
the reaction observable. In the present study we apply a fully
microscopic framework to the (α, α′) inelastic scattering to

the 0+
2 state of 12C, and show that the calculated result agrees
with the experimental cross section and essentially there is no
room for the missing monopole strength.

In this study we adopt the g-matrix folding model with the
target-density approximation (TDA) [18–20]; the local den-
sity of the target nucleus is used as an input density for the
g matrix. This TDA g-matrix approach has been derived
from the nucleus-nucleus multiple scattering theory [21] in
Ref. [19] and shown to work well for describing the elastic
scattering of 3He [19] and α [18, 20] off several mid-heavy
and heavy target nuclei. We do not include the chiral three-
nucleon force modiﬁcation to the g matrix because its effect
on α scattering was shown to be very small [20].

We consider α as a projectile (P) and 12C as a target nu-
cleus (T). The α particle is assumed to stay in the ground state,
whereas the transition of 12C between the 0+

and 0+
3 states are explicitly taken into account. The coupled-
channel (CC) equation to be solved is given by

data are taken from Refs. [16, 30, 32].

inelastic cross section would decrease at all angles and the
good agreement at forward angles would be lost, though it is
not so clear at 172.5 MeV because of the lack of data at very
forward angles. We show the results for the elastic scattering
in Fig. 3 in the same way as in Fig. 2; a very good agreement
between the calculated cross section and the experimental data
is obtained, which conﬁrms the reliability of the microscopic
reaction calculation adopted.

In a recent work [33] it was shown that the monopole
transition strength, 4.5 ± 0.5 e fm2, to the 0+
2 state deter-
mined by comparing the theoretical result with the experimen-
tal data is consistent with that deduced from electron scatter-
ing. However, the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics cal-
culation adopted in the reaction analysis gives a larger value
(6.6 e fm2) of the transition strength. Therefore in Ref. [33]
the structural input and the reaction observables still have a
gap of about 30%. Furthermore, the interaction strength was
adjusted so as to reproduce the elastic scattering data; the
renormalization factor for the real (imaginary) part is 1.05
(1.27) and 1.24 (1.38) for the analysis at 240 and 386 MeV,
respectively.

Finally, we show by the solid (dashed) line in Fig. 4 the real
(imaginary) part of the coupling potential between the 0+
1 and
0+
2 states of 12C for the α inelastic scattering at 172.5 MeV.
An important characteristic of the coupling potential is that it
has a peak at the origin and well concentrated in the nuclear
interior region.
In Ref. [17] it was shown phenomenologi-
cally that this behavior of the coupling potential is essential to
reproduce the absolute value of the 12C(α, α′)12C(0+
2 ) cross
section. It should be noted, however, that the origin of this
behavior in the present study is completely different from that

of P (T). The Coulomb potential between P and T is denoted
by U Coul(R). Yλ is the spherical harmonics, jn is the spheri-
cal Bessel function, (L′0L0λ0) is the Clebsch-Gordan coefﬁ-
cient, and W (LSL′S′|Jλ) is the Racah coefﬁcient.

This coupled-channel approach with a g matrix has widely
been adopted so far [22–25]; the possible double-counting for
the coupling to non-elastic channels are expected to be negli-
gible as discussed in Ref. [25]. Equation (2) contains two key
ingredients. One is the nuclear transition density ρλ
γγ ′ and the
other is the g matrix g(dr/ex); the superscript dr (ex) indicates
the direct (exchange) part of g, an explicit form of which is
shown in, e.g., Ref. [26].

We adopt the transition density of 12C obtained by the res-
onating group method (RGM) based on a three-α model [2];
1 (9.64 MeV), 2+
the 0+
2
(9.84 MeV) [16], and 0+
3 (10.3 MeV) states are considered as
mentioned above. These densities are shown to reproduce the
elastic and inelastic form factors for electron scattering and
are thus highly reliable. In the CC calculation of the (α, α′)
process, we include all the six states listed above; we use
the experimental values of the excitation energies. For the
ground state density of α, ρP, we take the phenomenologi-
cal one determined from electron scattering [27] in which the
ﬁnite-size effect of proton charge is unfolded with a standard
procedure [28].

As for g, we use the Melbourne g-matrix interaction [29],
which has been highly successful, with no free parameters, in
describing various nucleon-nucleus elastic and inelastic cross
sections in a wide range of incident energies. The use of a
g-matrix interaction having a predictive power is one of the
most essential features of the present study. As mentioned,
we use the TDA for evaluating the argument ρ in g(dr/ex),
i.e., ρ = ρλ=0
γγ (rm), where rm denotes the midpoint of the
interacting two nucleons. For the nondiagonal potentials, we
take the average of the densities in the initial and ﬁnal states,
i.e., ρT = [ρλ=0

γγ (rm) + ρλ=0

γ ′γ ′ (rm)]/2.

sections of

with the experimental data [16, 30, 32]. One sees that with
no free adjustable parameters the inelastic cross section to the
0+
2 state of 12C is reproduced well at forward angles at these
three energies. At larger angles the calculation slightly over-
shoots the experimental data. However, there seems to be no
room for the missing monopole strength; if it could exist, the

In summary, we have calculated the α-12C inelastic cross
section to the 0+
2 of 12C with a microscopic coupled-channels
method using the RGM transition density of 12C and the Mel-
bourne g-matrix interaction. We have obtained a good agree-
ment between the calculated and measured values of the in-
elastic cross section at forward angles, as well as that of the
elastic cross section. It suggests that the monopole transition
strength obtained by the RGM calculation is consistent with
the value extracted from the reaction observable. Thus, it is
concluded that there is no missing monopole strength of the
Hoyle state.
