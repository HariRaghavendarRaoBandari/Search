We study sets of unitary transformations on qubits forming bases for subspaces of M (2, C) such
that the square of Hilbert-Schmidt inner product of matrices from the diﬀering bases is a constant.
We construct the maximal number of such bases for the 4 and 2 dimensional subspaces while proving
the nonexistence of such a construction for the 3 dimensional case. We also provide the average
ﬁdelity for estimating any of such a transformation and show that it is equal to the case for estimating
a completely unknown unitary from SU(2).

INTRODUCTION

The idea of indistinguishability of quantum states and
the inability to clone an arbitrary state has brought with
it the acceptance of physical limits on how much one can
know of a quantum system. In the context of mutually
unbiased bases (MUB) - for a review on the subject of
MUB see e.g. ref.[1], considering an unknown quantum
state selected from sets of MUBs; a measurement of an
observable described by projectors onto states in a basis
mutually unbiased with respect to the prepared one pro-
duces completely random results. This would later come
to be the key ingredient in the well known BB84 quan-
tum key distribution (QKD) protocol [2] as well as most
(if not all) prepare and measure QKD schemes where
eavesdropping of a transmitted message would statisti-
cally induce errors for which below a certain threshold,
legitimate parties may distill a secret key nonetheless.

While optimally estimating a quantum state deals with
the maximal information extraction of the system’s state,
the issue of estimating an unknown physical transforma-
tion, described by a unitary operator on a state is another
matter. This was studied in [3] where it is a more chal-
lenging task compared to state estimation as it requires
not only the use of optimal measurements of the resulting
state post transformation but also an optimal state prior
to the transformation to begin with. An immediate use
of such an estimation, the alignment of reference frames
using quantum spins was noted in [4] as being equivalent
to estimating unknown rotations of SU(2).

This paradigm has also found its way in the ﬁeld of
quantum cryptography where protocols making use of a
bi-directional quantum channel and unitary transforma-
tions for encoding purposes like that of [5–7] rely on the
inability of an eavesdropper (commonly referred to as
Eve), to ascertain the transformations perfectly without
inducing errors. However, this inhibition for Eve does not
reﬂect an intrinsic inability with regards to the transfor-
mation themselves, rather is chieﬂy due to the inability of
estimating the encoded states traveling between the legit-

imate parties (commonly referred to as Alice and Bob).
It was in [8] that the notion of two-way QKD based on
indistinguishable unitaries was ﬁrst mooted where Alice’s
transformation for encoding purposes is selected from two
orthogonal bases of unitary transformations; one com-
prising the identity and Pauli matrices, the other would
be those unitaries rotated by an angle 2π/3 about the
axis (1, 1, 1)/√3 of R3. In [9], these bases were referred
to as mutually unbiased bases of orthogonal qubit uni-
taries. A two-way QKD study with non-entangled qubits
using ‘nonorthogonal’ unitaries was later reported in [10],
providing for a higher security threshold compared to its
conventional predecessors for selected attack strategies.
As opposed to the idea of MUB, which is very well
known, in this work, we aim to formalize the notion of
such unitaries to which we refer to as mutually unbi-
ased unitaries (MUU) and proceed in Section II, with
the construction of the maximal number of MUU on a
two dimensional Hilbert space, H2, namely qubit. We
then show how this is immediately connected to maxi-
mally entangled states forming MUBs (Section III) for a
4 dimensional Hilbert space H2 ⊗ H2. Focusing on the
MUUs for H2, we calculate the ﬁdelities in distinguishing
between the unitaries. We show how this is equal to the
discrimination of the maximally entangled states from
the varying MUBs and subsequently equal to estimating
a completely unknown unitary from SU(2) (Section IV).

II. MUTUALLY UNBIASED UNITARIES FOR

QUBITS

MUB refers to orthonormal bases of a Hilbert space
such that the transition from any one state in one basis
to any state in the other basis are equiprobable [1]. In
other words, if one is asked to guess an unknown state,
|ui prepared in one basis of say a d dimensional Hilbert
space, Hd, and we let the states |ri and |si be ‘guesses’
(resulting from a measurement) from a mutually unbi-

ased basis, then

|hu|ri|2 = |hu|si|2 = 1/d.

Along with |Tr(σj U1)|2 = 4|pj|2,∀j and U †U = I2, we
have |pj|2 = 1/4. On the other hand, a generic 2 × 2
unitary matrix, U , may be written as

(1)

2

In estimating an unknown unitary U ∈ SU(d) with a
guess Ur, Ref.[3] considers how closely Ur resembles U
by determining the behaviour of the unitaries, averaged
over all states |αi ∈ Hd given by,

Thus, beginning with a unitary U ,
let Ur and Us
be guesses for U , we could say that the guesses are
equiprobable if
Limiting
ourselves to unitaries acting on states in H2, we provide
the following deﬁnition for MUU.

for i, j, = 1, . . . , n, some constant C 6= 0 and Tr(A†B) is
the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product of matrices A and B.

With the number n as the cardinality of the basis sets
which reﬂect the dimensionality of the subspace, in the
following subsection we provide explicit constructions of
MUU for n = 4 and 2. Furthermore we note that no
MUU exists for n = 3. This is simply due to the fact
that any subspace spanned by three orthogonal 2 × 2
matrix necessitates the uniqueness of such a basis.

A. MUU for n = 4

We begin by considering the set B0 = {I2, σ1, σ2, σ3} as
the basis for M (2, C) where I2 is the identity operator
and σ1, σ2, σ3 are the Pauli matrices given by

σ1 = (cid:18)0 1

1 0(cid:19) , σ2 = (cid:18)0 −i

i 0 (cid:19) , σ3 = (cid:18)1 0

0 −1(cid:19) .

(4)

While it is obvious that the matrices in this set are pair-
wise orthogonal, one could begin with a basis containing
arbitrary but pairwise orthogonal unitaries and with no
loss of generality, set one element as identity I2. This
would eventually lead to other elements being the Pauli
matrices. We begin by deﬁning a unitary element U as a
linear combination of elements of B0,

U = p0I2 +

3

Xi

piσi.

(5)

U = eiα(cid:18) a

b

−b∗ a∗(cid:19) .

(6)

By comparing eq.(5) and eq.(6) with regards to element
eiαa and eiαa∗, we can write

eiαa = p0 + p3 ⇒ eiαa∗ = e2iα(p∗
eiαa∗ = p0 − p3 ⇒ eiαa = e2iα(p∗

0 + p∗
3),
0 − p∗
3).

The above equations give us

p0 = e2iα(p∗
p3 = −e2iα(p∗

0) ⇒ p2
3) ⇒ p2

0 = e2iα/4,
3 = −e2iα/4.

(7)
(8)

(9)
(10)

Similar treatment for elements eiαb and −eiαb∗ would
result in

p2
1 = −e2iα/4,
p2
2 = −e2iα/4.

(11)
(12)

There can only be 2 solutions for each pi in the above
equations, corresponding to positive and negative solu-
tions. Representing the solutions for pi to the above
equations as a 4-vector, (p0, p1, p2, p3), one can have at
most 16 set of solutions for a given α. As

(13)

is equivalent to Ub; eiβ acts like a
we say eiβUb
‘global phase factor’ and is inconsequential
in the
context of MUU. Hence, the set (p0, p1, p2, p3) and
(−p0,−p1,−p2,−p3) (the case where β = π) would
provide for equivalent matrices, then the number of
nonequivalent solutions would be at most 8 for a given
α. As the factor α itself has no eﬀect on the equiva-
lence of matrices, we conclude that there can be at most
8 matrices which are mutually unbiased with regards to
all elements in B0. The 8 set of solutions allow us to
explicitly construct the vectors
B1 = 

B2 = 

It can easily be shown that both B1 and B2 span M (2, C)
and

Thus the number of MUU for n = 4 is 3 (including B0).

1 = −1/2.

As mentioned earlier, no MUU can exist in the case of
n = 3. The proof is rather straightforward.

Beginning with an arbitrary basis V = {V1, V2, V3} ⊂
M (2, C) for a 3 dimensional subspace of M (2, C), it can
always be mapped to S = {I2, σi, σj}, for i 6= j where
V †
1 V1 = I2 and V †
1 V2 = σi. If we require V to be MUU
with respect to S, V1 must be an element of the span
of S and V1 = q0I2 + qiσi + qjσj with |q0|2 = |q1|2 =
|q2|2 = 1/3. Thus V2 = V1σi = q0σi + qiI2 + qjσiσj.
However, σiσj is not in the span of S, hence V cannot
be an MUU with respect to S and we conclude no MUU
exist for n = 3.

C. MUU for n=2

While all orthogonal (possibly distinct) bases of M (2, C)
spans the same space, M (2, C), the case for n = 2
suggests the possibility of considering a number of
possible orthogonal bases of which each basis could very
well span a distinct subspace. Hence, constructing MUU
for one subspace naturally sets to question whether the
same number of MUU could be constructed in another
subspace. To this end, we deﬁne the equivalence between
bases for distinct subspaces.

two distinct

orthogonal basis, X

Deﬁnition 2
Consider
=
{X1, X2, ..., Xn} and Y = {Y1, Y2, ..., Yn} for n ≤ 4
spanning possibly distinct subspaces M (X ) and M (Y)
respectively. X is equivalent to Y, X ≡ Y, provided
that ζYj = U Xj,∀j = 1, 2, ..., n for some unitary U and
|ζ| = 1.
Proposition 3
Given the above deﬁnition for X ≡ Y and n ≤ 4, X is
MUU with regards to a set Z = {Z1, Z2, ..., Zn} ⊂ M (X )
if and only if Y is MUU with regards to a set
UZ = {U Z1, U Z2, ..., U Zn} ⊂ M (Y).
The above proposition is easily shown to be true by
|Tr(X †
j Zk)|2 = |Tr((U Xj)†U Zk)|2 = |Tr((ζYj )†U Zk)|2 =
|Tr((Yj)†U Zk)|2.
The case for n = 4 has M (X ) = M (Y) and is trivially
the case of changing basis in M (2, C).
In the case of
n = 2, we could consider an arbitrary orthogonal basis
deﬁned by {A, B} which is equivalent to the basis W0 =
{I2, ω} where ω = A†B; and spans a subspace, M1. We
then let ω be represented by a generic matrix like eq.(6)
and given eq.(13), set α = 0.

Let W0 = r0I2 + r1ω ∈ M1 be a unitary matrix. With
|Tr(I2W0)|2 = |Tr(ωW0)|2 = 4|rj|2,∀j and W †
0 W0 = I2,
we have |rj|2 = 1/2. Working with the same approach as
we did for n = 4, where we compare W0 with a generic

The above, admits only 4 sets of solutions for (r0, r1)
and given (r0, r1) and (−r0,−r1) provide for equivalent
matrices, the number of matrices MUU to (I2, ω) are at
most 2. Constructing a basis, W1, comprising of these 2
matrices becomes straightforward;

W1 = (cid:26) I2 + ω
√2

,

√2 (cid:27) .
I2 − ω

(18)

We can thus conclude that the maximal number of MUU
for n = 2 is 2.

Explicit examples for ω in terms of Pauli matrices
include {I2, σ2} which is MUU with respect to {(I2 ±
σ2)/√2} and {I2, σ3} to {(I2 ± σ3)/√2}.

III. MUU AND MUB OF MAXIMALLY

ENTANGLED STATES

The study of unitary transformations, more generally
quantum channels, is well known to be closely connected
to that of maximally entangled states through the iso-
morphism between unitaries, U on H2 and vectors, |Uii
(using the notation from [11]) in H2 ⊗ H2,

U ≡ Xi Xj

hj|U|ii|ii|ji = |Uii ∈ H2 ⊗ H2

(19)

aUb)(cid:12)(cid:12)

for some basis vectors |ii,|ji of H2. With |hhUa|Ubii|2 =
and |Uii/√2 gives a maximally entangled
(cid:12)(cid:12)Tr(U †
state [12], the search for MUU is tantamount to looking
for sets of maximally entangled states which not only
forms a basis for H2⊗H2 but are also mutually unbiased
to one another (the dimensionality of H2⊗H2 is 4, states
are mutually unbiased if the absolute value of their inner
product is given by 1/2). Hence, with |I2,ii/√2 = |Φ+i,
|σ1ii/√2 = |Ψ+i, |σ2ii/√2 = |Ψ−i and |σ3ii/√2 = |Φ−i

the maximal number of such MUBs are three and they
are

with |E0i = |Φ+i,|E1i = i|Ψ+i,|E2i = |Ψ−i,|E3i =
i|Φ−i (also known as ‘magic basis’ [13]). It is worth not-
ing that the requirement for entangled states as a basis
would not allow for the construction of the maximal num-
ber of MUB for a four dimensional system (which would

for two-qubit states, if one begins by constructing 3 Bell-
type bases which are mutually unbiased, then one cannot
construct two additional bases sets.

This connection can be extended to the case of MUU
for n = 2 as the dimension of the subspace is 2 where
mutually unbiased states have the absolute value of their
inner product as 1/√2. The absolute value of the in-
ner product between maximally entangled states, say
|Uaii/√2 and |Ubii/√2 derived from diﬀering MUU in
this case would result in |hhUb|Uaii|/2 = |Tr(U †
b Ua)|/2 =
1/√2.

IV. DISTINGUISHABILITY OF MUU

In distinguishing between unitaries selected randomly
from the set SU(d), Refs.[3, 15, 16] consider a black box
executing the unitary transformation, where one may
submit a particular quantum state (which may comprise
of a qubit entangled to an ancillary system), through the
black box and the resulting state, may be measured to
provide information of the transformation. Given a sin-
gle use of the box, the task requires not only an optimal
input but also an optimal measurement of the output
state. If one considers the set {Ug} as a (projective) ir-
reducible representation of a group G, a pure maximally
entangled state, |Γi, may be used as an optimal input
[12] and the issue of discriminating between unitaries Ug
reduces to one of discriminating states in the group orbit
[15]

{|ΓgihΓg| = (Ug ⊗ IR)|ΓihΓ|(Ug ⊗ IR)† | g ∈ G}. (21)
It is necessary though to subscribe to the minimal dis-
criminating requirement of Ref.[15] where Ug = λUk ⇒
g = k for λ ∈ C, g, k ∈ G. Ref.[3] showed that the optimal
i |i, ii/√d ∈ Hd ⊗ Hd
input state can be chosen to be Pd
being Hd a d dimensional Hilbert space.
In considering the discrimination between elements of
MUU, we apply the same method above, though we re-
strict our study of to the case of n = 4. More precisely,
let us consider the scenario of selecting a unitary trans-
formation randomly from the set of unitaries ∪2
i=0Bi and
we choose for the input state,

|Ψi =

1
√2|00i + |11i ∈ H2 ⊗ H2.

(22)

It is easy to check that

∀ |ψi ∈ Bi,∀U ∈ Bj, U ⊗ I|ψi ∈ B(i+j) mod 2

(23)

and the problem of discriminating between unitaries se-
lected from the set ∪2
i=0Bi is really an optimal discrimi-
nation of MES forming mutually unbiased bases, i.e the
group orbit here is {|ΓgihΓg|} where |Γgi ∈ ∪2
Bi. In
this case, the estimation of unitaries from sets of MUU
coincides with the estimation of MES from sets of MUBs.

i=0

4

In discriminating between the MES above, we apply
quite directly the method and use of extremal covari-
ant measurements in [17] for quantum states of prime
powered dimensions. Let us rewrite the states of B0
with |Φ+i ≡ |0i,|Ψ+i ≡ |1i,|Ψ−i ≡ |2i and |Φ−i ≡ |3i
with {|ii, i ∈ F4} as the ‘computational basis’ in H4 and
F4 is the ﬁnite ﬁeld of cardinality 4. Let us then con-
sider the projective representation of the Abelian group
G = F4 × F4 as [17]

R(G) = {UqVw | (q, w) ∈ F4 × F4}

where

Uq|ii = |i ⊕ qi,
Vw|ii = hw, ii|ii

(24)

(25)

it inital),

|0ih0|,

Considering the state (call

with hw, ii = χ(w⊙i) where χ(x) is a nontrivial character
of the additive group F4. The operations ⊕ and ⊙ are
of course ﬁeld addition and multiplication respectively.
Writing x as a tuple (s1, s2), si ∈ {0, 1}, we choose χ(x)
as exp (πis1) [18].
it can
be easily checked that its orbit under R(G) is indeed
{|iihi|, i ∈ F4}. This holds similarly for the states from
B1 and B2 where the orbits under R(G) for any one ‘in-
tial’ state in one basis is the set of all states from the
respective bases and the stability groups for the initial
states are nontrivial. From [17], with R(G) being irre-
ducible, an extremal positive operator valued measure is
the group orbit of a single operator and we may conclude
that, with the choice of basis, B0, B1, B2 being equally
probable, the optimal measurement operator is the or-
thogonal measurement onto any one of the bases.

The average estimation ﬁdelity [3] in discriminating

these states, can then be written as

where P (|si||ui) is the probability of a measurement of

average ﬁdelity of discriminating between states selected
randomly from ∪2
Bi is really 1/2. This is in fact the
same maximal value for the average estimation ﬁdelity of
a completely unknown MES in H2⊗H2 immediately cal-
culated from [3] as well as that for a completely unknown
unitary in SU(2) as from [9].

V. CONCLUSION

We have formalized in this work, the notion of unitary
transformations forming bases of M (2, C), for which the
elements in one basis are ‘mutually unbiased’ with re-
spect to elements in another basis. The essence of the
deﬁnition is in capturing the notion of distinguishing be-
tween unitary transformations based on their actions on
qubit states. We explicitly construct such bases and

show that the maximal number of such bases is 3 for
the 4-dimensional vector space of M (2, C) and 2 for a
2-dimensional subspace of M (2, C). Using the isomor-
phism between operators on H2 and states in H2 ⊗ H2,
we straightforwardly arrive at the maximal number of
MUBs for MES. We also show how estimating a unitary
selected randomly from the full set of MUUs is equivalent
to the estimation of a MES selected randomly from the
maximal number of MUBs and the average estimation
ﬁdelity is 1/2 which is equal to the case for estimating
a completely unknown MES or a completely unknown
unitary from SU(2).

There are obviously various interesting directions this
work may be extended to,
including an infomation-
disturbance tradeoﬀ in the estimation of such unitaries (a
more speciﬁc scenario of [9]) as well as a proper under-
standing of possible entropic bounds in estimating the
unitaries.
Immediate applications of such studies in a

5

quantum cryptographic setting as brieﬂy mentioned ear-
lier, for which a more thorough study may be in wanting.
Other direct issues would include generalizing the study
to unitaries acting on higher dimensional quantum sys-
tems.
