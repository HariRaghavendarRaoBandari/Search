ABSTRACT

Context. The diﬀuse cosmic X-ray background (CXB) is the sum of the emission of discrete sources, mostly massive black-holes
accreting matter in active galactic nuclei (AGN). The CXB spectrum diﬀers from the integration of the spectra of individual sources,
calling for a large population, undetected so far, of strongly obscured Compton thick AGN. Such objects are predicted by uniﬁed mod-
els, which attribute most of the AGN diversity to their inclination on the line of sight, and play an important role for the understanding
of the growth of black holes in the early Universe.
Aims. The fraction of obscured AGN at low redshift can be derived from the observed CXB spectrum assuming AGN spectral
templates and luminosity functions.
Methods. We show that high signal-to-noise average hard X-ray spectra, derived from more than a billion seconds of eﬀective
exposure time with the Swift/BAT instrument, imply that mildly obscured Compton thin AGN feature a strong reﬂection and contribute
massively to the CXB.
Results. A population of Compton thick AGN larger than that eﬀectively detected is not required, as no more than 6% of the CXB
ﬂux can be attributed to them. The stronger reﬂection observed in mildly obscured AGN suggests that the covering fraction of the gas
and dust surrounding their central engines is a key factor in shaping their appearance. These mildly obscured AGN are easier to study
at high redshift than Compton thick sources.

1. Introduction

The cosmic X-ray background (CXB) is a broad band diﬀuse
emission discovered since the early era of X-ray astronomy (Gi-
acconi et al. 1962). It is known today that in the X-ray do-
main the CXB is the integrated emission of many faint point-
like extragalactic sources, most of them being Seyfert galaxies
or quasars.

At energies < 10 keV the CXB emission has been al-
most completely resolved into its constituting point-like sources
(Worsley et al. 2005) thanks to the focusing capabilities of soft
X-rays instruments like XMM-Newton and Chandra. The sum
of the ﬂuxes of the sources detected in deep X-ray surveys per-
formed by XMM-Newton in the Lockman Hole (Hasinger et al.
2001) and by Chandra (Giacconi et al. 2002; Alexander et al.
2003) almost reaches the level of the CXB ﬂux, conﬁrming that
the CXB is the combination of the emission of faint Active
Galactic Nuclei (AGN) with diﬀerent degrees of obscuration.

The sensitivity of current instruments is not enough to re-
solve the CXB at hard X-rays where lies the bulk of its emis-
sion. The extrapolated ﬂux of the AGN population resolved at
lower energies is not able to explain the CXB ﬂux at E ∼ 30
keV. The strength of X-ray reﬂection in AGN spectra is a possi-
bile solution to this discrepancy. Moreover, the reﬂection com-
ponent is the only relevant one in heavily obscured, Compton
thick AGN (CTK), i.e. sources where the density of the obscur-
ing material is high enough for Compton scattering to dominate
(NH > 1024 cm−2).

The CXB ﬂux and spectrum have been measured by
ASCA/SIS (Gendreau et al. 1995), ROSAT (Miyaji et al. 1998),
RXTE/PCA (Revnivtsev et al. 2003), XMM-Newton (De Luca
& Molendi 2004), Chandra (Hickox & Markevitch 2006) and
Swift/XRT (Moretti et al. 2009) at soft X-rays, and by HEAO1
(Marshall et al. 1980; Gruber et al. 1999; Revnivtsev et al. 2005)
and more recently by Beppo-SAX (Frontera et al. 2007), INTE-
GRAL (Churazov et al. 2007; Türler et al. 2010) and Swift/BAT
(Ajello et al. 2008) at hard X-rays. The measurements are in
agreement at a level of ∼ 10 − 15% throughout the full energy
range of the CXB (Revnivtsev et al. 2005; Frontera et al. 2007;
Ajello et al. 2008; Moretti et al. 2009).

The fraction of AGN which need to be CTK to explain the
CXB ﬂux is still debated: e.g. Gilli et al. (2007) suggested that
50% of the obscured AGN have to be CTK, a similar value is
proposed also by Ueda et al. (2014) while Treister et al. (2009)
proposed a smaller fraction, around 15%.

The method to perform the CXB synthesis has been devel-
oped in the seminal works of Setti & Woltjer (1989); Comastri
et al. (1995) and improved in following works. To synthesize the
CXB spectrum three main “ingredients” must be known: an ac-
curate description of the broad band spectra of the various AGN
classes, the luminosity function which gives the number density
of AGN per comoving volume as a function of luminosity and
redshift, and the so called NH distribution, i.e. the distribution of
AGN as a function of absorbing column density (NH).

AGN spectra are provided as spectral templates for the var-
ious AGN classes: previous works set the parameters of their
spectral templates to values representative of observations (e.g.

A&A proofs: manuscript no. bat_cxb_single

Gilli et al. 2007) or of models (e.g. Ueda et al. 2014). Special
care should be used for the CTK template: to model the ef-
fect of Compton scattering, especially the scattered component,
assumptions on the geometry of the scattering material must
be taken, and the spectrum is usually modelled through Monte
Carlo simulations assuming a torus geometry for the absorbing
material according to the AGN Uniﬁed model, e.g. Brightman &
Nandra (2011); Brightman et al. (2014) or the MYTORUS model1
proposed by Yaqoob (2012).

The AGN X-ray luminosity function (XLF) is derived from
deep surveys (e.g. Ueda et al. 2003; La Franca et al. 2005;
Hasinger et al. 2005; Aird et al. 2010; Ueda et al. 2014; Miyaji
et al. 2015; Buchner et al. 2015; Aird et al. 2015; Ranalli et al.
2015) and hence is available only in the soft X-ray range. The
NH distribution can be derived from data (e.g. Gilli et al. 2007,
but it is biased against the detection of highly absorbed sources)
or from models (e.g. Treister et al. 2009, and references therein).
As there are many parameters involved in the synthesis, there
is a certain level of degeneration in the process, especially in
the CTK determination, as shown by Treister et al. (2009) and
Akylas et al. (2012). Both authors show that the CTK density in
the Universe can not be constrained by the CXB alone, the main
reason being the lack of a robust CTK spectral template.

In this work we use parameters derived from average spec-
tra of AGN classes measured by Swift/BAT (14 – 195 keV) to
build spectral templates representative of real spectra, resolving
the uncertainty in the synthesis process due to the choice of the
templates. The shape of the templates strongly aﬀect the syn-
thetized CXB spectrum, specially at hard X-rays where lies the
bulk of the CXB emission and where the contribution of CTK
sources is relevant.

The AGN sample and the BAT stacking method are de-
scribed in detail in Sections 2 and 3. In Sections 4 and 5 we
describe the ingredients used in the synthesis, i.e. the spectral
templates, the XLFs and the NH distributions. In Section 6 we
present the results and in particular the maximum fraction of
CTK allowed by the data and we discuss them in Section 7.
Throughout this paper we assume H0 = 70 km s−1 Mpc−1,

ΩM = 0.3 and ΩΛ = 0.7.

2. The Sample
We use the ﬁnal sample of 165 sources of Ricci et al. (2011)
(R11) to build the stacked spectra. All these sources are Seyfert
Galaxies detected by INTEGRAL IBIS/ISGRI for which red-
shift and NH measurements are available: the redshift spans from
0.001 to 0.162, the NH from 4 1019 to 2.1 1024 cm−2.

All these sources have also been detected by Swift/BAT
(Tueller et al. 2010; Krimm et al. 2013). As the BAT ﬁeld of
view is ∼ 10 times larger than that of ISGRI, stacking BAT data
allows to achieve unprecedent statistics.

R11 analysed stacked ISGRI spectra of Seyfert Galaxies, in-
troducing a classiﬁcation based on absorption: Seyfert 2 galaxies
are divided into Lightly Obscured sources (LOB), Mildly Ob-
scured sources (MOB) and CTK sources.

We notice that the NH distributions of these 4 samples are
overlapping: there are 7 sources classiﬁed as Seyfert 1 with NH
> 1022 cm−2, 2 Seyfert 2 galaxies with NH < 1021 cm−2, and that
29 sources, classiﬁed as Seyfert 1.5, were not included in these
samples. Hence we deﬁned an alternate set of samples based
exclusively on the NH: Unabsorbed (NH < 1021 cm−2), LOB1

The total number of sources in each set is reported in the
ﬁrst column of Table 1. These two sets of samples were used to
produce stacked images to derive two diﬀerent sets of spectral
templates for the CXB synthesis.

3. Stacking of BAT data
The main scientiﬁc goal of the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) on
board Swift satellite (Gehrels et al. 2004) is the detection of hard
X-ray transients, especially Gamma-Ray Bursts. Thanks to its
large ﬁeld of view (1.4 sr partially-coded) it is also an ideal sur-
vey instrument, observing the full sky for very long integrated
exposure time.

The Swift/BAT detector consists of 215 pixels of CdZnTe
(Barthelmy et al. 2005) recording X-ray photons arriving from
the sky through a random (50% open) coded mask, made of
∼ 54000 obscuring lead tiles supported by a honeycomb panel.
Each source in the ﬁeld of view projects a shadow of the mask on
the detector plane. The on-board electronic accumulates 80-bin
spectra from every pixels during a ﬁxed integration period (typ-
ically 5 minutes) and send these histograms to ground, together
with other data streams. The signal from each source and from
the background (dominated by the CXB) can be reconstructed
through an image deconvolution. Most sources can only be de-
tected in mosaic of sky images obtained from many (∼ 1000 sec)
spacecraft pointings.

The Swift/BAT reduction pipeline for the all-sky survey is
described in Tueller et al. (2008, 2010), Baumgartner et al.
(2013) and Krimm et al. (2013). Our pipeline follows this closely
and is based on the BAT analysis software HEASOFT v 6.13.

A ﬁrst analysis was performed to derive background detector
images. We created sky images (task batsurvey) in the 8 stan-
dard energy bands (in keV: 14 - 20, 20 - 24, 24 - 35, 35 - 50, 50
- 75, 75 - 100, 100 - 150, 150 - 195) using an input catalogue of
86 bright sources that have the potential to be detected in single
pointings. The detector images were then cleaned by removing
the contribution of all detected sources (task batclean) and av-
eraged to obtain one background image per day. The variability
of the background detector images was then smoothed pixel-by-
pixel ﬁtting the daily background values with diﬀerent function

V. Esposito and R. Walter: Mildly obscured active galaxies and the cosmic X-ray background

(spline, polynomial). A polynomial model with an order equal to
the number of months in the data set adequately represents the
background variations. A similar background smoothing func-
tion was used by the BAT team.

The BAT image analysis was then run again using these
smoothed averaged background maps. The new sky images were
then stored in an all-sky pixel database by properly projecting the
data on a ﬁxed grid of sky pixel, preserving ﬂuxes (the angular
size of the BAT pixels varies in the ﬁeld of view). This database
can then be used to build local images and spectra or lightcurves
for any sky position.

The result of our processing was compared to the standard
results presented by the Swift team2 for individual sources and
a very good agreement was found.

To extract the average spectra of the diﬀerent samples of
Seyfert galaxies, we followed the procedure adopted by Walter
& Cabral (2009) and R11. We created 500 × 500-pixels mosaic
images modifying the coordinate system of each individual im-
age, setting the coordinates of each source of the sample to an
arbitrary ﬁxed position (α = 0, δ = 0). The geometry of the im-
age was also modiﬁed to obtain a uniform point spread function
at the center of the mosaic whatever is the position of the source
in the ﬁeld of view. These mosaic images, built independently for
each energy band, provide a stack of all the sources of a given
sample.

To minimize the systematics in the mosaic images, we ex-
cluded the noisiest images. A total of 201130 sky images were
ﬁnally included in the processing, covering 8 years from January
2005 to December 2012. Each sky image was in fact included
many times, once for each source of the sample present in its
ﬁeld of view. The mosaic images were built with a tangential
projection using a factor of two oversampling when compared
to the individual input sky images. This results in a pixel size of
7.5954 arcmin at the center of the mosaics. The photometric in-
tegrity and accurate astrometry were obtained by calculating the
intersection between input and output pixels, and weighting the
count rates according to the overlapping area.

The average signal, extracted from the mosaic for each indi-
vidual sample, the exposures and the number of sources used are
reported in Table 1. The detection signiﬁcances of the stacked
sources in the mosaics are calculated as the number of counts
divided by the square root of the variance and range between
111σ and 57σ. The eﬀective exposure obtained at the center of
the mosaics are between 0.627 Gs and 0.140 Gs.

The eight bin stacked spectrum for each AGN sample was
extracted from the mosaic images using mosaic_spec3. The
standard BAT response matrix depends on the oﬀ-axis angle and
cannot be used when data from many oﬀ-axis angles are aver-
aged. To produce a suitable matrix we followed the same proce-
dure adopted by the BAT team for the survey work (Baumgart-
ner et al. 2013), which consists in tuning the on-axis response
to obtain a correct spectrum for the Crab nebula. The tuning ac-
counts for the fact that a smaller fraction of the low energy pho-
tons are detected on average over the ﬁeld of view when com-
pared with the on-axis expectation, largely because of absorp-
tion in the honeycomb mask supporting structure. The correction
therefore depends on the average spectrum of the Crab nebula.
Figure 1 shows the ratio between the observed spectrum (ob-
tained by us and by Baumgartner et al. 2013) and the powerlaw
(Fν ∼ ν−1.15) model representing the Crab nebula, obtained as-

suming the on-axis response. The eﬀect of the absorption at low
energy is clearly observed. Up to 80 keV the observed spectra
are consistent within a few %. At higher energies Baumgartner
et al. (2013) required an additional correction that we are not ob-
serving. The red curve in ﬁgure 1 is very similar to the NOMEX
absorption model used for the supporting structure of the IBIS
mask on board INTEGRAL (Lubinski 2006). We ﬁnally used the
response matrix provided by Baumgartner et al. (2013)4, modi-
ﬁed to obtain a good powerlaw adjustment to the spectrum of
the Crab nebula, in particular above 80 keV. A systematic uncer-
tainty of 2% has been added in all spectral model adjustments
to account for the uncertainty related to the oﬀ-axis eﬀects at
low energies. We also built a second response matrix assuming
a broken powerlaw for the Crab spectrum (Jourdain et al. 2008)
and found that the resulting spectral parameters (Tab. 2) were
identical within the uncertainties.

4. Stacked spectra and spectral templates
The stacking of the Swift/BAT data described in Sec. 3 allows us
to obtain the average spectra of the Seyfert galaxy classes in the
BAT energy bandpass (14 – 195 keV) characterized by diﬀerent
absorption levels. The parameters derived from these spectra are
then used as spectral templates in the CXB synthesis.

The stacked spectra of the samples built for log(NH) < 24
have been ﬁtted with the pexrav model modiﬁed for photoelec-
tric absorption. The pexrav model consists of an exponentially
cut oﬀ powerlaw plus reﬂection from an inﬁnite slab of neutral
material, representing an accretion disk (Magdziarz & Zdziarski
1995). The absorption has been ﬁxed to the central value (in log-
arithmic space) of the included sources.

The spectral ﬁt has been performed with XSPEC (version
12.8.2) using the χ2 minimization method. As described in Sec-
tion 3 the spectra are binned in 8 energy bins, and the stacked
sources are not detected in the highest one, so it is ignored in the
spectral ﬁt. The spectra are shown in Figure 2 with the best ﬁt
model and residuals.
The impressive statistics (the total number of photons in the
spectra ranges between ∼ 12000 and ∼ 34000) obtained with

the stacking method allows us to measure with good accuracy
the relevant spectral parameters, i.e. the spectral index Γ and the
covering factor of the reﬂecting material R. Table 2 reports these
parameters for each spectrum. The cutoﬀ energy Ec lies beyond
the upper threshold of the BAT energy band and can not be con-
strained by the ﬁt, so we ﬁxed it at Ec = 200 keV, as it is un-
likely to have higher values (Malizia et al. 2014). We ﬁxed also
the inclination angle θ at the value of cos θ = 0.45 and solar
abundancies were assumed.

We notice that the spectral index Γ becomes softer for ab-
sorbed sources, in agreement with the results of Burlon et al.
(2011); Vasudevan et al. (2013), who also analyzed Swift/BAT
spectra stacked according to absorption. The mildly obscured
samples (MOB Seyfert 2 and MOB) feature a strong curvature,

signature of a high level of reﬂection (Tab. 2). This reﬂection am-
plitude is larger than observed in the spectra derived for lightly
absorbed samples and comparable with the reﬂection shown by
the unabsorbed sample. The parameters listed in Table 2 are
model dependent and we do not know if e.g. the cutoﬀ energy
is the same in unabsorbed or absorbed sources, but the diﬀer-
ent curvatures are conﬁrmed in Figure 3, which is also not af-
fected by uncertainties in the instrumental calibration and re-
sponse, conﬁrming that the diﬀerence in curvature observed be-
tween the LOB and MOB stacked spectra is not an artifact. This
conﬁrms with much higher signal to noise and solidity, previ-
ously obtained results (R11, Vasudevan et al. 2013).
This eﬀect is not apparent in Burlon et al. (2011) as they
stacked only unabsorbed (NH < 1022 cm−2) and absorbed (NH
> 1022 cm−2) spectra. We conclude hence that although the
stacking method of Burlon et al. (2011) and Vasudevan et al.
(2013) are diﬀerent from the one adopted in this work, the re-
sults are in agreement.

The model dependence of the parameters in Table 2 does not
matter very much for the CXB synthesis as long as the spectral
templates provide a good representation of the average spectra.
We have veriﬁed that ﬁtting the data with a diﬀerent ﬁxed cutoﬀ
energies provides diﬀerent parameters but produce ﬁnally the
same synthesied CXB. This will be discussed in more detail in
Sec. 7.

To generate the spectral template of CTK sources we adopted
the MYTORUS model (Yaqoob 2012), which properly calculate the
absorption due to Compton scattering. This model assumes a
powerlaw emission as primary component and a donut shaped
torus with ﬁxed solar abundancies surrounding the central emit-
ter. It provides a transmitted component and a scattered com-
ponent, the latter ones plays the role of the pexrav reﬂection
component. The shapes predicted by the pexrav reﬂected com-

We should point out that these spectral templates are derived
by stacking local AGN. We assume that they are representative
of AGN up to z ∼ 1.

5. X-ray luminosity function and NH distribution
The XLF gives the AGN number density per comoving volume
as a function of intrinsic unabsorbed luminosity and redshift. We
used the XLFs of Ueda et al. (2003), Hasinger et al. (2005), Ueda
et al. (2014) and Miyaji et al. (2015) (U03, H05, U14 and M15
respectively). U03, U14 and M15 built their XLFs in the 2 − 10
keV energy band, for both “type-1” and “type-2” objects, and
using samples of 247, 4039 and ∼ 3200 AGN, respectively. The
XLF of H05 were built in the 0.5 − 2 keV energy band and used
944 AGN “type-1” objects. Gilli et al. (2007) (G07) compared
the H05 XLF with other XLFs (U03, La Franca et al. 2005) built
from “type-1” plus “type-2” objects in order to estimate a lu-
minosity dependent ratio of obscured versus unobscured object
Ro/u(LX), and corrected the H05 XLF in order to obtain the den-
sity of obscured AGN. We used the same correction.

The XLFs are derived ﬁtting the sample with an analyti-
cal empirical smoothed two powerlaw formula which has been
found to ﬁt well the data in the local universe. This expression is
then corrected for a density evoluction factor ed to set the depen-
dence on the redshift. The analytical expression of the density
evolution factor is deﬁned according to an evolution model. U03,
H05 and U14 agreed that the best ﬁt to the data is achieved using
the Luminosity Dependent Density Evolution (LDDE) model,
i.e. ed depends on both the X-ray luminosity LX and the redshift
z, rather than other models like the Pure Luminosity Evolution
(PLE) model where the density evolution factor depends on the
redshift z only. We used the best ﬁt XLF models provided by
them, which are described as:

dΦ (LX, z)
d log LX

While U03 used exactly these equations, H05 introduced an

In the CXB synthesis process, the analytic equation of the
XLF is multiplied by the luminosity LX and then integrated in
the range 42 < log Lx < 48 and 0 < z < 5. The uncertainties of
the XLFs at high luminosity and high redshift are not relevant
for the CXB synthesis as the contribution to the CXB of AGN

To conclude the template modeling, we ﬁnally added a scat-
tered component in the range 1−10 keV in obscured spectra (i.e.
with log(NH) > 21), following the recipe of Gilli et al. (2007),
to model the X-ray emission in excess of the absorbed power-
law commonly observed in Seyfert 2 galaxies. It is modeled as a
cutoﬀ powerlaw with Ec = 5 keV, the same spectral index of the
main component, and normalization ﬁxed at 3% of the normal-
ization of the main component. As the iron line and other rele-
vant emission lines are located at energies below the BAT lower
energy threshold, we did not include any line in our modeling.
With the spectral parameters, we generated spectral tem-
plates in the range 1 ÷ 500 keV (Fig. 4) which were used for
the CXB synthesis. Previous works, e.g. Gilli et al. (2007); Ueda
et al. (2014), assumed a gaussian dispersion of spectral indexes.
As our templates are derived from stacked spectra, they represent
the average value of the sample, hence we choose to not include
any dispersion.

from Swift/BAT. These spectra are plotted against Swift/XRT
(Moretti et al. 2009), ASCA SIS (Gendreau et al. 1995), INTE-
GRAL (Churazov et al. 2007), Swift/BAT (Ajello et al. 2008),
HEAO1 (Gruber et al. 1999), ROSAT (Miyaji et al. 1998) and
Chandra (Hickox & Markevitch 2006) data. It should be pointed
out that we do not perform any ﬁt or renormalization against the
data. Figure 6 shows also the separated contribution of unab-
sorbed, LOB (here is the sum of log(NH) = 21.5 and log(NH) =
22.5), and MOB AGN. The CTK fraction is usually estimated to
ﬁll the gap between the total contribution of Compton thin ob-
jects and the data. The CTK fraction shown corresponds to the
one estimated in the corresponding paper.

The main diﬀerences between the synthesis models are
caused by the XLF. Even without CTK sources, H05 and U03
XLFs are in good agreement with the data abobe 30 keV. The
U14 XLF instead produces a CXB spectrum, 10 - 20% fainter
than that observed by Chandra, with a wide gap between the
data and the spectrum at ∼ 30 keV. As mentioned previously,
this XLF is too faint to account for the CXB at soft X-rays, and
requires a large fraction of CTK sources to match the CXB at
hard X-rays.

6.2. Fitting the Compton Thick contribution

The CTK contribution to the CXB is estimated by varying the
CTK fraction through a χ2 minimization. To investigate the ef-
fect of using the BAT templates (Sec. 4), the CXB is synthetized
with the combinations of XLFs and NH distributions used by
G07, T09 and U14 in order to estimate the CTK fraction. We
used the same CXB datasets used in the respective papers. Ta-
ble 3 reports the ﬂux due to the CTK sources at the peak of the
integrated spectrum. With the BAT templates, we obtain signiﬁ-
cantly less CTK sources. However in all these cases the ﬁt to the
CXB is not acceptable. Table 3 refers to results obtained with the
BAT spectral templates derived from the samples based on ab-
sorption, using the samples based on Seyfert type leads to similar
results.

We then compared the CXB synthesis with the CXB ob-
served with ROSAT, Swift/XRT, Swift/BAT and INTEGRAL.
We considered only the ROSAT data above 1 keV to exclude the
soft excess component from the CXB modeling. These datasets
as well as those of XMM-Newton (Moretti et al. 2009) and
Chandra are well cross-calibrated and feature similar CXB nor-
malization. Their calibration also matches these of the recent
XLF obtained with deep soft X-ray surveys by XMM and Chan-
dra.

Table 4 shows the estimates of the CTK fraction for the com-
binations of XLFs and NH distributions shown in Figure 6. We
report both the ﬂux of the CTK contribution at the peak and the
fraction of CTK objects (assuming that all CTK are in the NH
range 1024 − 1025 cm−2) needed to produce this ﬂux, as well the
best χ2
red. With the XLF and NH distribution used by G07 and
T09 and with the BAT templates the amount of CTK allowed by
the synthesis is less than in the referred papers conﬁrming that
BAT templates produce higher CXB ﬂux. Even with the XLF
and NH distribution of U14 we obtain a lower CTK fraction. The
ﬁt to the CXB data is not good whatever are the combitation of
XLF and NH distribution considered: the BAT templates with the
previous models can not adequately represent the data.

41 < log Lx < 44. The black line represent the best ﬁt, gray regions
show the eﬀect of uncertainties in the parameters: dark (light) gray cor-
respond to 1σ (2σ) region. The red line is U03 XLF. Red and blue points
are taken from U14, and represent the data derived from the soft (< 2
keV) and hard (> 2 keV) X-ray band respectively, converted in 2 to 10
keV luminosities as explained in U14.

in this range is negligible.

Figure 5 shows the U14 XLF for two redshift bins with the
conﬁdence regions at 1σ and 2σ and the U03 XLF for compari-
son. The conﬁdence region is mostly related to the uncertainties
on γ1 and L∗. The uncertainty on the XLF normalization can
be up to ∼ 10% (1σ). The CXB synthesis of U14 (whose XLF
is mostly based on Chandra surveys) falls 10 - 20% short of
the CXB ﬂux measured by Chandra. This indicates that the
XLF is probably underestimated even though other sources can
contribute to the CXB in the soft X-ray band.

The fraction of AGN with diﬀerent NH must be known to
synthetize the CXB. We used the NH distribution derived by G07
and Treister et al. (2009) (T09) and also derived it to obtain the
best match between the observed and syntetized CXB. These NH
distributions, displayed in Figure 7 show signiﬁcant discrepan-
cies.

It has to be pointed out that these NH distributions do not
depend on redshift and luminosity, contrasting with some obser-
vations (La Franca et al. 2005; Hasinger 2008; Aird et al. 2010,
2015; Miyaji et al. 2015; Buchner et al. 2015, U14). To account
for this eﬀect, U14 proposed an empirical analytical function for
the NH distribution dependent on LX and z. We tested that func-
tion togheter with the U14 and M15 XLFs, which used it in their
works.

The CTK AGN are considered separately from the above NH
distributions, their fraction is evaluated adjusting the CXB syn-
thesis to the observations.

are shown. Each panel shows the spectra and the diﬀerence between the data and the synthesis.

6.3. Fitting the NH distribution
In order to achieve a better representation of the CXB spec-
trum, we adjusted the NH distribution directly to the data. We
performed several ﬁts with diﬀerent assumptions to investigate
possible systematics eﬀects: we used the XLF of U14 or U03,
we ﬁxed the maximum NH of the distribution at 1025 cm−2, as
done by T09, or at 1026 cm−2, as done by G07 and U14 (the
implications of this choice are discussed later), and we used the
BAT templates based on the samples deﬁned according to NH or
Seyfert type (see Sec. 3).

There are several sources of uncertainties on the CXB nor-
malization and synthesis. We improved the uncertainty on the
spectral templates by using average hard X-ray spectra. The in-
tegrated XLF varies by 15% for diﬀerent assumptions and by
13% taking 1σ statistical uncertainties on the XLF into account.
The CXB normalization between the various datasets varies by
10 - 15% and the ﬂux of the CXB synthesis produced with the
U14 XLF falls 10 - 20% below the Chandra CXB data. In ad-
dition, we investigated the fraction of absorbed AGN which still
escape detection. We simulated spectra with NH uniformly dis-

tributed into 6 linearly spaced bins in the range 1023 − 1024 cm−2
(corresponding to our MOB sources deﬁnition), with the spectral
index Γ = 1.72 derived for the MOB sources (Tab. 2), and con-
volving them with the Chandra matrix response assuming the
total exposure of the Deep Chandra Surveys used by U14. We
then looked for the deabsorbed luminosity required to be de-
tected by Chandra, and integrated U14 XLF from to the lower
limit (log Lx = 42) to this luminosity threshold in order to esti-
mate the AGN fraction which fails to be detected. We estimated
that 11% of the mildly obscured AGN at redshift < 1.3 have too
faint spectra to be detected even in deep Chandra observations,
adding an additional source of uncertainty to the XLF normal-
ization.

In order to account for these uncertainties in the ﬁtting pro-
cess we introduced a scaling factor wich allow for a renormal-
ization of the synthesis on the data. The resulting factors vary
from 1 to 1.3 for diﬀerent XLFs.

uncertainties in the ﬁt of the NH distributions are such that they
are compatible with the NH distributions published previously.

7. Discussion

7.1. Stacked BAT spectra

The uniﬁed model assumes that diﬀerent classes of AGN can
be explained by the observer line of sight crossing or not
an anisotropic absorbing medium (Antonucci 1993; Urry &
Padovani 1995). This does not explain why MOB sources feature
a larger reﬂection. A clumpy absorber model can oﬀer a solution,
as obscuration and reﬂection could increase with the number of
clumps. This geometry was put forward independently to explain
high resolution infrared spectra of AGN (Ramos Almeida et al.
2011; Elitzur 2012).

The BAT spectra of Compton thin AGN are modeled with
the pexrav model with a cutoﬀ energy ﬁxed at 200 keV. There
is a degeneracy between the cutoﬀ energy and the reﬂection. Fig-
ure 9 shows the conﬁdence contours as a function of Ec and R
for the spectra of the LOB1 and MOB samples respectively, and
indicates that the stronger reﬂection observed in MOB sources
is solid and not an eﬀect of the ﬁxed cutoﬀ energy.

To verify the eﬀect of the ﬁxed cutoﬀ energy on the CXB
synthesis, we also derived the best ﬁt parameters for Ec = 150
keV and Ec = 250 keV and performed the synthesis with these
templates. The bump at ∼ 30 keV is well reproduced in all cases
and the templates contribute to the synthesis in the same way,
because the spectral models remain a good representation of the
data. Changing the cutoﬀ energy does not signiﬁcantly change
the spectral index, therefore the ﬂux of the template in the energy
band of the XLF (2−10 keV for U14) is not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent
for these cases, leading to similar normalizations in the CXB
synthesis.

As mentioned in Section 4, previous works (e.g. G07, U14)
introduced a gaussian dispersion on the spectral index of their
templates to reproduce the variance of the observed spectral
slopes. The eﬀect on the synthesis is to increase the ﬂux of the
CXB at hard X-rays (G07). We checked the eﬀect of adding a
spectral index dispersion in our synthesis and noticed that in our
case the eﬀect is not as strong as the BAT spectra already mea-
sure the spectral shape in the range 15 to 150 keV. We therefore
did not introduce a spectral index distribution also as the BAT
templates already average the contribution of many sources.

7.2. Contribution of Compton Thick AGN

Figure 10 shows the contour plot of the fraction of MOB sources
and of the ﬂux at the peak of the CTK contribution for the various
models listed in Table 5. The scaling factor added in the ﬁtting
procedure is taken into account. All the contour plots show the
expected tendency that the fraction of MOB decreases in order to
allow for a stronger CTK contribution. For all the combinations
investigated, the best ﬁt indicates a CTK ﬂux at the peak less than
1 keV cm−2 s−1 Str−1 and a 1 σ upper limit of 2.1 - 2.9 keV cm−2

s−1 Str−1 for the U03 and respectively U14 XLF, corresponding
to 4 - 6% of the CXB emission. These ﬂuxes correspond to a
CTK emission two (T09) to three times (U14 and G07) fainter
than that estimated in previous works.

Our ﬂuxes correspond to a maximum fraction of CTK AGN
between 12% (for U03 XLF) and 21% (for U14 XLF) assuming
that all CTK objects have NH < 1025 cm−2. As CTK objects
are mostly undetected, it is not clear where the NH distribution
should end. In the CXB modeling, the maximum absorption of
CTK sources is typically considered to be NH = 1025 cm−2 (e.g.
T09) or NH = 1026 cm−2 (e.g. G07, U14). The CTK fraction
thus depends on the NH distribution of the CTK sources, which
is unknown: previous works simply assumed it to be constant.
Adding a separate spectral template for deeply obscured CTK
sources (25 < log(NH) < 26) in our ﬁtting procedure, we found
that their fraction is basically unconstrained by the data. Fixing
it to the same value as of mildly obscured CTK sources we get
a CTK fraction between 21% (for U03 XLF) and 29% (for U14
XLF).

In the ﬁtting procedure of the NH distribution (Sec. 6.3) we
added a scaling factor in order to account for various systematics
eﬀect. We did not introduce this scaling factor when ﬁtting the
Compton Thick contribution alone (Sec. 6.2) because there we
wanted to use exactly the same hypotheses as used in previous
works, in order to verify the eﬀect of the BAT templates on the
CTK fraction estimation. We found that using these assumptions
and the measured hard X-ray templates, does not provide a good
ﬁt to the CXB.

In the Swift/BAT catalogue of local AGN, only 5.5% of them
are classiﬁed as CTK (log(NH) > 24) (Burlon et al. 2011), while
in the CHANDRA South Deep Field this fraction goes up to 20%
(Brightman & Ueda 2012). The discrepancy is related to the dif-
ferent sensitivity of the two instruments: Burlon et al. (2011)
estimated that correcting for the bias against detection of very

Article number, page 10 of 11

absorbed sources the intrinsic CTK AGN fraction over the total
AGN is 20%, in agreement with Brightman & Ueda (2012). As
most of these CTK objects have NH < 1025 cm−2 this is con-
sistent with our upper limit of 21%. We hence conclude that a
population of Compton thick AGN larger than that eﬀectively
observed is not required to account for the CXB.

The CXB spectrum is dominated by low luminosity sources,
but also by low redshift sources: 99% of the CXB ﬂux is gen-
erated by AGN located at z < 1.3. The CXB hence can not be
used to constrain galaxy evolution at high redshift. It is yet un-
clear if mergers of galaxies in the early Universe have triggered
rapid black-hole growth, stellar formation and obscuration (Hop-
kins et al. 2006) or if the evolution has been more linear (Caplar
et al. 2015). The stronger reﬂection observed in mildly obscured
sources locally should be probed at higher redshift to study how
the quasar environment evolved (Alexander et al. 2013).

8. Summary and Conclusions
We measured the averaged hard X-ray spectral properties of se-
veal samples of Seyfert galaxies by stacking BAT spectra. We
found that mildly obscured sources (1023 < NH < 1024 cm−2)
feature a stronger reﬂection than less absorbed sources, suggest-
ing that AGN are surrounded by a clumpy rather than by a donut
shaped torus.

The stacked BAT spectra have been used to deﬁne spectral
templates of Seyfert galaxies and to synthetize the diﬀuse cos-
mic X-ray background. We found that the strong reﬂection of
mildly obscured sources contribute massively to the bulk of the
CXB emission, leaving little space for the contribution of Comp-
ton thick sources, in contrast with the results of previous works.

We investigated possible systematic eﬀects in the synthesis
process due to assumptions in the modeling, using diﬀerent XLF,
spectral templates built on diﬀerent samples, considering or not
the contribution of strongly obscured Compton Thick sources
(1025 < NH < 1026 cm−2). In all cases, only 4 - 6% of the
ﬂux of the CXB at 30 keV can be attributed to Compton Thick
sources.

We allowed a renormalization factor on the absolute ﬂux of
the CXB synthesis to account for the uncertainties in the CXB
measurements and in the XLF parameters. The MVN (Monitor
Vsego Neba) X-ray astronomical experiment (Revnivtsev et al.
2012) will help improving our knowledge on the CXB normal-
ization.
