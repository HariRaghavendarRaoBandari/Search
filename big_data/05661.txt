ABSTRACT

With current space-based missions it is now possible to obtain age-sensitive asteroseismic information for
tens of thousands of red giants. This provides a promising opportunity to study the Galactic structure and
evolution. We use asteroseismic data of red giants, observed by Kepler, to test the current theoretical framework
of modelling the Galaxy based on population synthesis modeling and the use of asteroseismic scaling relations
for giants. We use the open source code Galaxia to model the Milky Way and ﬁnd the distribution of the masses
predicted by Galaxia to be systematically offset with respect to the seismically-inferred observed masses. The
Galactic model overestimates the number of low mass stars, and these stars are predominantly old and of low
metallicity. Using corrections to the ∆ν scaling relation suggested by stellar models signiﬁcantly reduces the
disagreement between predicted and observed masses. For a few cases where non-seismic mass estimates are
available, the corrections to ∆ν also improve the agreement between seismic and non-seismic mass estimates.
The disagreement between predictions of the Galactic model and the observations is most pronounced for stars
with [Fe/H] < −0.5 and [Fe/H] > 0 or for Teﬀ > 4700 K. Altering the star formation rate in order to suppress
stars older than 10 Gyr improves the agreement for mass but leads to inconsistent color distributions. We
also tested the predictions of the TRILEGAL Galactic model. However, unlike Galaxia, it had difﬁculties in
reproducing the photometric properties of the Kepler Input Catalog because it overestimates the number of blue
stars. We conclude that either the scaling relations and/or the Galactic models need to be revised to reconcile
predictions of theory with asteroseismic observations.

1. INTRODUCTION

Our understanding of the formation of the Milky Way is se-
riously hampered by our inability to reliably measure ages of
stars. In recent years, asteroseismology has been been demon-
strated as a promising method to estimate fundamental stellar
properties, including ages. From the seismology one can infer
stellar radius and mass, and for red giants, mass is a good age
indicator when the metallicity is known (Chaplin & Miglio
2013). The fact that we can access asteroseismic informa-
tion for a large number of stars, due to missions like Kepler
(Hekker et al. 2011; Stello et al. 2013), CoRoT (Mosser et al.
2010; Miglio et al. 2013b), and now also K2 (Stello et al.
2015a), means that we can start using this information to un-
ravel the formation history of the Milky Way.

We can use asteroseismic information to model the Milky
Way within the framework of stellar population synthesis
(Robin & Creze 1986). Such models generate a synthetic cat-
alog of stars for a given prescription of galactic structure and
evolution. The predictions can then be directly compared to
observations. A few such models are publicly available and
have been developed and ﬁne tuned to satisfy observational
constraints from various photometric, spectroscopic, and as-
trometric surveys. These include Besanc¸on (Robin et al.
2003), TRILEGAL (Girardi et al. 2005) and Galaxia (Sharma
et al. 2011).

The ﬁrst study to make use of asteroseismic information

to test a stellar population synthesis-based model was per-
formed by Miglio et al. (2009). A more comprehensive study
was carried out by Chaplin et al. (2011), who compared the
mass and radius distributions of about 400 main-sequence
and subgiant stars with the TRILEGAL stellar population
synthesis model (Girardi et al. 2005). They found that the
radius distribution matched with the model predictions but
the mass distribution showed signiﬁcant differences. Specif-
ically, the model was found to under predict the number of
low mass stars (M < 1.15M(cid:12)). However, the Kepler main-
sequence/subgiant sample is small in size, is local to the Sun
and is dominated by young stars, which limits it applicability
for detailed model comparison.

In comparison to main-sequence and subgiant stars, red gi-
ants offer a number of advantages. For red giants the age
is almost independent of luminosity. Hence, for any given
apparent-magnitude-limited sample, one can obtain red giants
spanning a wide range in age. Being luminous, they probe the
Galaxy further for any given apparent magnitude and allow us
to sample different regions of the Galaxy. The ability to sam-
ple different regions of the Galaxy is essential for Galactic
archaeology because different regions of the Galaxy are dom-
inated by different components. For example, the fraction of
old stars increases with height above the Galactic mid plane.
Miglio et al. (2013b) carried out a differential study of the
Milky Way using red giants with asteroseismic information
from CoRoT. Using about 2000 red giants in two different re-
gions of the Galaxy, they showed that the mass distributions
differ, in agreement with theoretical models. However, they
did not make a direct comparison with Galactic models. With
Kepler, we now have a sample of oscillating red giants that is
more than an order of magnitude larger than any other as-

2

teroseismic sample that has been tested against predictions
of stellar population synthesis models (12964 red giants by
Stello et al. 2013). The aim of this paper is to use this large
sample of giants in the context of modeling the Galaxy.

However, a signiﬁcant outstanding problem of using red gi-
ants is that modeling their individual frequencies is too time
consuming for the analysis of tens of thousands of stars.
We therefore rely on using asteroseismic scaling relations,
and ∆ν ∝ ρ (Brown et al. 1991; Kjeld-
νmax ∝ gT
sen & Bedding 1995), to estimate their radius and mass (and
hence age). Here, νmax is the frequency of maximum ampli-
tude and ∆ν the average large frequency separation. These
relations assume that the structure of a red giant star is ho-
mologous with respect to the Sun. In reality this assumption
is not strictly correct and veriﬁcation of the relations is ongo-
ing. However, independent high-precision estimates of mass
and radius required for this veriﬁcation are difﬁcult to obtain.
For subgiants and dwarfs, the νmax scaling relation has been
shown to work well (Bedding 2014) and recently, Coelho
to be
et al. (2015) found the proportionality νmax ∝ gT
accurate to within 1.5%. Using Hipparcos parallaxes and/or
interferometry, the asteroseismic radii calculated from scal-
ing relations have been found to be accurate to within 5%
(Bruntt et al. 2010; Silva Aguirre et al. 2012; Huber et al.
2012). For giants we generally do not have accurate paral-
laxes, so such studies are awaiting results from Gaia (Perry-
man 2002). Open clusters have been used to test the scal-
ing relations for giants (Brogaard et al. 2012; Sandquist et al.
2013; Miglio et al. 2012). Miglio et al. (2012) found agree-
ment to within 5% for scaling relation-based radii. Testing
of masses is more challenging. For a few cases where such
veriﬁcation have been performed, the scaling relation-based
masses seem to be overestimated for giants (Miglio et al.
2012; Frandsen et al. 2013; Epstein et al. 2014). For two
lower red giant branch stars (Epstein et al. 2014) ﬁnd evidence
that the mass estimated by using only ∆ν (but with additional
νmax independent quantities) is lower compared to using both
∆ν and νmax. Based on this they suggested that a modiﬁ-
cation to the νmax scaling relation might be required. Theo-
retical modelling has suggested corrections to the ∆ν scaling
relation (Stello et al. 2009; White et al. 2011; Miglio et al.
2013a), but there has been no comprehensive study to verify
the corrections. In relation to νmax, Houdek et al. (1999) and
Chaplin et al. (2008) had suggested theoretically that νmax co-
incides with the plateau of the damping rate with frequency.
Belkacem et al. (2011) conﬁrmed this for the Sun using SoHO
GOLF observations. Balmforth (1992) suggested that this is
caused by a resonance between the thermal adjustment time
of the superadiabatic boundary layer and the mode frequency,
which was also conﬁrmed by the theoretical study of Belka-
cem et al. (2011) (see also Belkacem 2012; Belkacem et al.
2013). However, there is currently no way to accurately pre-
dict νmax from theory.

Additionally, there are a few factors related to the Kepler
red giant sample that make it difﬁcult to use them for popula-
tion synthesis-based modeling. Firstly, knowing the selection
function of the stellar sample is an essential requirement for
such an analysis. However, this function has currently not
been quantiﬁed. Secondly, the g, r, i and z band photometry
in the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC, Brown et al. 2011) differs
slightly from the corresponding Sloan magnitudes (Pinson-
neault et al. 2012). This means the synthetic photometry that
comes with isochrones, which is calibrated to Sloan magni-

tudes, needs to be re-calibrated, and this has not been done.
We speciﬁcally address these issues here.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2, describes our
methods. We ﬁrst describe the Galactic models that are com-
pared against the seismic observations. Next, we discuss how
to map the synthetic stars of Galactic models into the observa-
tional space. Following this, we discuss how to convert mass
and radius to asteroseismic observables and vice verse.
In
Section 3, we analyze the Kepler giant samples. We investi-
gate corrections to the scaling relations in Section 4, and cor-
rections to the Galactic model in Section 5. Finally, in Section
6, we discuss implications of our ﬁndings.

2. METHODS

2.1. Stellar-population-synthesis-based modeling of the

Milky Way

The main Galactic stellar-population-synthesis model used
in this paper is from the Galaxia code 4 (Sharma et al. 2011).
It uses a Galactic model based on the Besanc¸on model by
Robin et al. (2003) but with some modiﬁcations. Galaxia uses
its own 3D extinction scheme to specify the dust distribution.
We also apply a low latitude correction to the dust maps as
in Sharma et al. (2014). The isochrones to predict the stellar
properties are from the Padova database (Marigo et al. 2008;
Bertelli et al. 1994). The unique feature of Galaxia is its novel
star-spawning scheme which, unlike previous codes, does not
discretize the spatial dimensions into multiple lines of sight.
Instead, it generates a continuous three-dimensional distribu-
tion of stars.

Full details of the Galactic model are available in Robin
et al. (2003) and Sharma et al. (2011), but here we summarize
the main features. The Milky Way in Galaxia/Besanc¸on con-
sists of four major components: the thin disc, the thick disc,
the bar shaped bulge, and the halo. Each component has its
own initial mass function (IMF) and an analytic formula for
the spatial distribution of stars. The thin disc is built up using
a star-formation history, while other components are assumed
to be populations of ﬁxed age. In the thin disc, the metallic-
ity of stars is governed by an age metallicity relation and the
spatial distribution of stars is governed by an age scale-height
relation. The full Besanc¸on Galactic model is tuned to sat-
isfy constraints from the Hipparcos mission (ESA 1997) and
star counts from surveys in optical and near infrared bands
(Robin et al. 2003). The Galactic potential is computed in
a self-consistent manner taking into account the results from
the Hipparcos mission.

In addition to Galaxia, we used the TRILEGAL5 Galactic
stellar-population-synthesis model (Girardi et al. 2005). Un-
like Galaxia, TRILEGAL cannot generate stars over a wide
angular area. Therefore, we generated stars along 21 lines
of sight pointing towards the centers of the 21 Kepler CCD-
module foot prints on sky. We used TRILEGAL with the de-
fault settings but with binary stars turned off. For extinction,
we used the extinction model of Galaxia. One noticeable dif-
ference between Galaxia and TRILEGAL is that, Galaxia uses
a constant star formation rate, while the default setting in TRI-
LEGAL uses a two-step star-formation rate, in which the rate
between 1-4 Gyr is twice that at any other time.

match well, which is encouraging given that we do not en-
force any ﬁne tuning of the model. However, the distributions
of g − ddo51 and g − r (Figure 1b,d) for the synthetic cata-
log are slightly redder for the giants (right most peaks). The
discrepancy for g − ddo51 is especially large. Either the g
band or the ddo51 band photometry, or both could be dis-
crepant. A clue to the cause of the discrepancy is provided
by results of Pinsonneault et al. (2012), who found system-
atic differences in the KIC (u, g, r, i, z) photometry with re-
spect to SDSS (u, g, r, i, z) photometry, for a small part of
the Kepler ﬁeld which overlaps with the SDSS. Because the
isochrones that we use are calibrated to the SDSS bands, this
could partly explain the mismatch that we see with the KIC.
To investigate this, we show in Figure 2, a copy of Figure 1b,
but we add (in green) the g − ddo51 color after applying the
Pinsonneault et al. (2012) transformations to the KIC stars.
We see that this corrected KIC distribution matches the pre-
dictions of Galaxia (blue). Hence, a correction in g band is
enough to explain the mismatch seen in the distribution of
g − ddo51 color. The transformations proposed by Pinson-
neault et al. (2012) were:
gSDSS = gKIC + 0.0921(gKIC − rKIC) − 0.0985 + [0.055]
rSDSS = rKIC + 0.0548(rKIC − iKIC) − 0.0383 + [0.0]
iSDSS = iKIC + 0.0696(rKIC − iKIC) − 0.0583 + [0.02]
zSDSS = zKIC + 0.1587(iKIC − zKIC) − 0.0597 + [0.02].
A slight adjustment of zero-points (see square brackets) from
the original Pinsonneault et al. (2012) transformations was
needed to make the green curve match with the Galaxia pre-
diction. Note slight adjustments of zero points are quite
common when comparing photometry obtained from differ-
ent sources.

The transformations of Pinsonneault et al. (2012) convert
KIC photometry to SDSS. However, for our analysis we re-
quire the inverse transformation, that is from SDSS to KIC
colors. This is because the stars observed by Kepler were
selected from the KIC photometry and not a re-calibrated ver-
sion of it. Equations 3 can be written in a matrix form and
then inverted to get the transformation formula for gKIC, but
this would require knowing the magnitudes in three bands
gSDSS, rSDSS and iSDSS. Instead, for our use, we derived a
simpler formula

(3)

gKIC = gSDSS − 0.25(gSDSS − ddo51) + 0.048

(4)
that makes use of only two bands, gSDSS and ddo51. The
formula is easily invertible to gSDSS = gKIC + (gKIC −
ddo51)/3 − 0.064. Moreover, because gSDSS and ddo51 are
on different photometric systems, their errors are less likely
to be correlated, which means the formula given by Equa-
tion 4 is more robust. The formula was derived by matching
the gKIC − ddo51 distribution of synthetic stars to those in
the KIC. The red curve in Figure 2 shows the results after ap-
plying Equation 4 to the g band photometry of the synthetic
catalog, which makes the g− ddo51 color distribution of syn-
thetic stars agree nicely with that of the KIC (black). This re-
sult is copied onto Figure 1b. The formula was also found to
improve the agreement for the g − r color distribution, which
is shown in Figure 1d. Thus, we can now successfully repro-
duce the photometry of the KIC stars using Galaxia. For the
rest of the paper we use the above formula to transform the g
band photometry of synthetic stars to compare the results of
Galaxia with observations. In general, the formula should be
valid for the version of Padova isochrones adopted in Galaxia.
We note that Farmer et al. (2013) has also suggested transfor-

FIG. 1.— Comparison of photometry between stars in the KIC and the syn-
thetic catalog generated by the code Galaxia. A correction term was applied
to the g band photometry of the synthetic stars to match the KIC distribution
of the g − ddo51 color (panel (b)). The blue line is for the case with no cor-
rection. The correction also improves the ﬁt to the g − r color distribution, in
regions near the red peak (panel (d)). p stands for probability density whose
integral over the abscissa is unity.

Before we can start comparing the asteroseismic results
with predictions from our Galactic models, we have to make
sure that the photometry of stars in the KIC and the Galactic
model predictions agree with each other. This is because the
asteroseismic targets observed by Kepler were selected based
on KIC parameters, which ultimately relied in its photomet-
ric entries. If the photometry of the Galactic model does not
match with the KIC, the model will be fundamentally incon-
sistent with observations, preventing meaningful model-based
inferences to be made. To proceed, we ﬁrst compared the pho-
tometry of the synthetic stars with that of stars in the KIC and
identiﬁed any differences. Next, we investigated the cause of
any mismatch and derive transformation formulae to rectify
it.

We generated a synthetic catalog of the Milky Way using
the code Galaxia. Stars, both from the synthetic catalog and
from the KIC, that lie within 8 degrees from the center of
the Kepler ﬁeld and with magnitude r < 14 were selected
for comparison. Note the KIC is expected to be complete
to magnitudes even fainter than 14 magnitude in r. We then
added photometric errors to the stars. For this we derived
the following formulas to approximate the actual photometric
errors in 2MASS and the KIC (Figure 4 in Brown et al. 2011):

mations from SDSS to KIC photometry, but those transforma-
tions (like ours) are speciﬁc to the adopted stellar models and
to the adopted bolometric corrections. We found their trans-
formations to be inadequate to explain the mismatch of the
g − ddo51 color that we encounter.

2.2. Estimating KIC stellar parameters of stars in the

synthetic catalog

As mentioned in the previous section, stellar targets of the
Kepler mission were selected based on stellar parameters in
the KIC, such as Teﬀ , log g, log Z, M, and R. These parame-
ters were derived from photometry as part of the stellar clas-
siﬁcation project (hereafter SCP). As part of the SCP, Brown
et al. (2011) developed a software code7 to generate stellar
parameters for the stars in the KIC based on a Bayesian poste-
rior maximization scheme. In order to reproduce the selection
function of the observed targets, we used this SCP software
code to generate KIC-equivalent stellar parameters for stars
in the synthetic catalog.

To run the SCP code, one has to specify the pho-
tometric bands to be used and the photometric uncer-
tainty in each band. While the KIC contains photome-
try in 10 bands, we chose to use only the following eight
(g, r, i, z, J, H, Ks, D51) that are available for the majority
of stars. We set the photometric uncertainty to 0.005 which
was found to best reproduce the KIC stellar parameters when
applied to KIC stars. The adopted photometric uncertainty is
close to but smaller than the quoted typical uncertainty in the
KIC of σ = 0.0175 mag for r < 14 (Brown et al. 2011).

Finally, we checked if our population synthesis model can
match the distribution of stellar parameters in the KIC. The
comparison is shown in Figure 3. We see that the SCP-
generated stellar parameters in the synthetic catalog (red line)
match well with that of the KIC (black line), which is a pre-
requisite to reproduce the selection function of the Kepler
mission. As an aside, we compared the true stellar parame-
ters (green line) of the synthetic catalog with that of their SCP
estimates (red line). We see slight differences. The SCP code
underestimates [Fe/H] by about 0.1 dex. The gravity of gi-
ants (log g < 3.5) is overestimated and also has signiﬁcant
uncertainty (red peak at ∼ 2.6 is broadened and shifted). Fi-

FIG. 3.— Comparison between observed (black) and predicted (using
Galaxia) distributions of stellar parameters for stars in the KIC. The red line
shows the stellar parameters of synthetic stars estimated with the SCP code,
which agrees well with the black line of KIC stars. The green line shows the
true stellar parameters of the synthetic stars. Comparing the red and green
lines reveals that the SCP underestimates the metallicity (panel (a)) and the
temperature of hot stars (panel (b)). Panel (c) shows that the sharp peak in
gravity of red clump stars is not well reproduced by the SCP code.

nally, for stars hotter than 5200 K SCP underestimates Teﬀ
by about 300 K. This means that the KIC underestimates the
radii of the main sequence stars. A similar effect was also
reported by Verner et al. (2011) while comparing the astero-
seismic radii with the KIC radii for a sample of subgiants and
dwarfs. The underestimation of radius by KIC, has important
implcations for detecting planets in habitable zones around
these stars. Specially, this would lead to underestimation of
planet radii when estimated using the transit method. How-
ever, this has no implication for the analysis of the red giant
stars presented in this paper.

2.3. Asteroseismic scaling relations and estimation of mass

and radius

Cool stars exhibit convectively driven oscillations whose
frequency spectra show a pattern of peaks similar to that seen
for the Sun. The near regular pattern is characterized by the
so-called large frequency separation, ∆ν, between overtone
modes. The amplitude of the peaks is modulated by an enve-
lope, which has a central frequency of maximum amplitude,
νmax. Theory indicates that ∆ν is related to the density of the
star (Ulrich 1986), while νmax has been conjectured to depend
upon the acoustic cut-off frequency of the atmosphere, and
hence the surface gravity and the effective temperature of the
star (Brown et al. 1991; Kjeldsen & Bedding 1995; Belkacem

estimated from photometry and have signiﬁcant uncertainty
and systematics that are not fully understood. In the follow-
ing, we therefore investigate the particular combinations of
νmax and ∆ν that comprise the seismic part of Equations 7
and 8. This will allow us to quantify the degree of error in-
troduced into estimating mass and radius from ∆ν and νmax
alone. Hence, we deﬁne the following two quantities,

(10)

To summarize, our strategy to compare asteroseismic pa-
rameters of synthetic stars with that of observations is as fol-
lows. We know M and R of the synthetic stars, which we use
to estimate ∆ν and νmax using the scaling relations (Equa-
tions 5 and 6). We then compute κM and κR of both the syn-
thetic and observed stars (Equations 9 and 10) and compare
them.

The accuracy of the scaling relations is still not fully quan-
tiﬁed. While one can predict ∆ν from theoretically derived
oscillation frequencies, it is currently not possible to do so for
νmax. In the next subsection we explore the corrections to the
∆ν scaling relation.
2.4. Correction to ∆ν scaling relation using stellar models
Analysis of the theoretical oscillation frequencies derived
from stellar models predict that ∆ν does not perfectly scale
as ρ0.5 (Stello et al. 2009; White et al. 2011; Miglio et al.
2013a; Mosser et al. 2013). To quantify this deviation we use
the correction factor

.

(11)

f∆ν =

135.1µHz

ρ(cid:12)

The value 135.1µHz corresponds to our adopted choice for
∆ν(cid:12). The stellar models show that f∆ν varies with metal-
licity, Z, mass, M, and age, τ. To estimate f∆ν we ran a
suite of stellar models for −1.28 < log Z < 2.12 (corre-
sponding to −3 < [Fe/H] < 0.4) and 0.8 < M/M(cid:12) < 4.0.
For this we used the MESA (v6950) 1M pre ms to wd test
suite case (Paxton et al. 2011, 2013, 2015), but without ro-
tation or mass loss invoked. We followed the approach by
White et al. (2011) to derive ∆ν for each model, designed to
mimic the way ∆ν is measured from the data. For this we
used GYRE (Townsend & Teitler 2013) to calculate the re-
quired radial mode frequencies. An in-depth description of
this model grid and some of its applications will be presented
in future (Stello et al. 2016 in preparation) 8. We estimated
f∆ν along each stellar track ranging from the zero-age main
sequence till the end of helium-core burning. The results were
remeshed in a grid in log Z, M, Estate, Teﬀ space with dimen-
sions of 13 × 19 × 2 × 200. The Estate is the evolutionary
state, with 0 for pre helium-ignition evolution and 1 for post
helium-ignition evolution. The age, τ, is replaced by variables
Estate and Teﬀ, which are observable (Bedding et al. 2011).
Then, using interpolation we computed the correction factor
f∆ν for each synthetic star and used it to correct ∆ν. From
now on we denote this derived correction factor by f Grid
∆ν . We

Here, f∆ν and fνmax are correction factors, which we have
introduced to quantify any deviation from the scaling rela-
tions. The correction factors are degenerate with the choice
of solar reference values. We ﬁx this by adopting a con-
sistent deﬁnition for the solar reference values. Throughout
the paper the solar reference values that we use are , ∆ν(cid:12) =
135.1 µHz, νmax,(cid:12) = 3090 µHz, and Teﬀ,(cid:12) = 5777 K and
are adopted from Huber et al. (2011, 2013). These are the val-
ues of the Sun obtained using the Huber et al. (2009) pipeline,
which was used by Stello et al. (2013). It is common practice
to use such “method-speciﬁc” solar values, meaning the val-
ues returned from solar data when using the same method as
used for the rest of the stellar sample. This practice is based
on the assumption that method-speciﬁc systematic differences
are the same for all stars (however see Hekker et al. 2013).

By rearranging the above equations, one can estimate mass

giant branch stars require a larger relative correction (left pan-
els, Teﬀ < 5000 K) compared to the red clump stars (right

has a strong dependence on both temperature and metallic-
ity (see also White et al. 2011). There is also a dependence
on mass. This can be seen as a shift of the green curves in
panel (c) and (e) with respect to the dashed curve, which is
the M = 1.0 M(cid:12) equivalent from panel (a).

3. ANALYSIS OF GIANTS

In this section we study a sample of 12964 red giants from
Stello et al. (2013). The observations were obtained in Ke-
pler’s long cadence mode (29.4 min). We ﬁrst determine the
selection function of the sample and then use that to select
stars from a synthetic catalog generated using a stellar popu-
lation synthesis model of the Milky Way. Next, we compare
the properties of the observed stars with those in the synthetic
catalog.

3.1. The selection function of the Kepler giants

In order to compare observations with Galactic model pre-
dictions, it is crucial that we know the selection function of
the observed targets. However, so far it has not been possible
to reproduce the selection function that generates the red giant
sample observed by the Kepler mission. Previous attempts to
characterize it can be found in Farmer et al. (2013) and Pin-
sonneault et al. (2014). The main source of information is the
paper by Batalha et al. (2010), which describes the selection
and prioritization of Kepler targets in general. The targets
were classiﬁed into 13 priority groups based on their stellar
parameters. The idea was to prioritize stars for which it was
possible to detect exoplanets, and if possible terrestrial plan-
ets in habitable zones. The compiled list consisted of 261,636
stars, of which the top 150,000 stars were initially selected for
observations. This included 5282 giants with log gKIC < 3.5
and r < 14.0, but in the end 17471 stars with these log gKIC
and r limits were observed. In other words, more than 50%
of the total Kepler red giant sample came from stars that were
added later on by the mission and for which the exact selec-
tion procedure is not documented. Other minor factors that
complicate the selection function are as follows. Numerous
additional targets were observed through the proposals by the

Guest Observer program and the Kepler Asteroseismic Sci-
ence Consortium. Each of these had their own complex and
often undocumented selection schemes. Moreover, all stars
were not observed for the same number of quarters. The
length of observation puts a limit on the range of log g over
which oscillations can be detected and characterized (e.g.,
Stello et al. 2015a).

In the following, we deduce an approximate form for the se-
lection function of the Kepler giants by comparing the proper-
ties of the observed giant sample against that of all stars in the
KIC. In Figure 5 we plot the KIC radius against the r band
magnitude of stars in the KIC. The majority of stars obey a
selection of the form (Rlow < R < Rup(r)), where R is the
stellar radius. The lower bound Rlow = 3.731R(cid:12) comes from
the fact that the seismic analysis by Stello et al. (2013) only
included stars with log gKIC < 3.45. In the KIC, log gKIC
and R almost follow a one-to-one relation, hence a limit on
log gKIC implies a limit on R. We found that Rup(r) was
well described by (see Figure 5)

The derivation of Equation 12 follows closely the scheme
used by Batalha et al. (2010) to select and prioritize the planet
search targets. The minimum detectable radius of a planet

was used to sample the stars in the synthetic catalog. The almost perfect match in r band is by construction, while a good match in other distributions, e.g color
and stellar parameters, is a veriﬁcation of the correctness of the applied selection function.
We found that Rplanet,lim = 3.7REarth provides a good
match to the upper envelope of the stellar radius for the red
giant sample (Figure 5).

3.2. Comparison of photometric parameters

Before investigating whether the mass and radius distri-
butions inferred from asteroseismic observations match the
Galactic model predictions, we ﬁrst needed to verify that we
have correctly reproduced the selection function. This was
done by comparing the photometric properties of the two sam-
ples. In Figure 6 we show the distributions of r band magni-
tude, colors, SCP-derived stellar parameters, the seismic ob-

servables (∆ν, νmax), and surface gravity of our giant sam-
ple, alongside synthetic stars from the Galactic model. The
seismic observables for synthetic stars were calculated us-
ing asteroseismic scaling relations (Equations 5 and 6 with
f∆ν = fνmax = 1). As before, the perfect match for the r
band distribution (Figure 6a) is by construction, but the good
match of the color distributions (Figure 6b-f) and the other
parameters gives conﬁdence that the adopted selection func-
tion is correct. The SCP-derived stellar parameters also match
well (Figure 6g-i). The slight difference in the SCP-derived
gravity distribution is due to our inability to exactly reproduce
SCP-derived gravity, as discussed in Section 2.2. Finally, the

The distributions of κM and κR (Equations 9 and 10) are
shown in Figure 7. In Figure 7a,b we do not apply a correction

clearly reduces the discrepancy. In
However, the use of f Grid
Figure 7e,f, we apply a correction to the νmax scaling relation
by setting fνmax = 1.02 to shift κM to higher values improv-
ing the agreement with observations. However, the predicted
distribution is still too broad (see Section 3.4 and 4 for further
discussion on these issues). We also investigated if choosing
higher photometric uncertainty while generating the SCP pa-
rameters had any effect on our ﬁndings (se Section 2.2). We
found that choosing a higher photometric uncertainty had no
signiﬁcant effect on the mass and the radius distribution of the
synthetic stars.
The isochrones in the Galactic model use Z(cid:12) = 0.019.
However, recent studies suggest a lower value of Z(cid:12) ≈ 0.014
(Asplund et al. 2009; Caffau et al. 2011). To be consis-
tent with the isochrones in the Galactic model we adopted
Z(cid:12) = 0.019 when computing f Grid
from our grid. We note
that, decreasing Z(cid:12) from 0.019 to 0.012 when computing
increases the predicted values of κM by about 6%. This

increase in κM is similar to the increase in κM that occurs
when fνmax is increased from 1.0 to 1.02.

We next study if the mismatch between observed and pre-
dicted κM distributions has any dependence on temperature.
We found that the mismatch is minimal if we restrict the sam-

we use SCP-based temperatures, because for observed stars

such a temperature dependent trend is not yet clear. Firstly,
these are SCP-based temperatures, which may be slightly
different from the actual temperatures. The age, metallic-
ity and temperature are correlated with each other. So, age
and metallicity-based trends could also manifest themselves
as temperature trends.

Kepler giants in the SAGA survey

9

In the previous section, we showed that the κM distribution
of the synthetic stars generated by Galaxia does not match
the observed stars. We now investigate if the mismatch is for
all stars in our sample, or whether it depends on metallicity.
To do this we make use of the SAGA survey, which provides
metallicities for an unbiased subset of red giants observed by
Kepler.

The SAGA survey (Casagrande et al. 2014) provided
Str¨omgren photometry for giants that have seismic parame-
ters from Kepler observations. The current release comprises,
989 Kepler red giants based on observations covering a stripe
centered at galactic longitude l = 74◦ and galactic longitude
ranging 7.6 < b < 19.9. In SAGA, Str¨omgren photometry
was combined with broadband photometry, and the infrared
ﬂux method was used to obtain Teﬀ with a precision of 85 K
and [Fe/H] with a precision 0.18 dex. We expect the SAGA
sample to be an unbiased subset of the full Kepler red gi-
ant sample because SAGA observed almost all stars down to
V = 15 mag, while the seismic giants are all brighter than
14th mag in r band (roughly corresponding to V = 14.35).
Casagrande et al. (2014) reported the SAGA giant sample to
be 95% complete with respect to the seismic targets. To check
for any potential bias, we compared the distribution of metal-
licity, temperature and r band magnitude of the SAGA gi-
ants with those of the synthetic stars satisfying the Kepler red
giant selection function described in Section 3.1 (Figure 9).
An uncertainty of 0.18 dex (similar to that of SAGA sample)
was added to the metallicity of the synthetic stars. The good
agreement between the synthetic and the observed distribu-
tions conﬁrms that the SAGA sample is an unbiased sample
of our Kepler red giant sample. No other large unbiased set of
metallicities are currently available for the Kepler red giants.
We now compare the κM distribution for the SAGA sam-
ple with that from the Galactic model. The κM values were
computed using the correction factor f∆ν from the grid of
stellar models in Section 2.4 and assuming fνmax = 1.02.
Figure 10a,b,c show that the mean κM increases with increas-
ing metallicity. However, the change in κM is stronger in
the Galactic model than in the data. The difference between
the model and the data is largest for the low and the high
metallicity bins, which account for 50% of the sample. For
−0.5 < [Fe/H] < 0.0, the predictions of the Galactic model
agree with observations.
Figure 10d shows the distribution of the SAGA sample for
the full [Fe/H] range (black) alongside the full Kepler red gi-
ant sample (green). They agree with each other, which illus-
trates once again that the SAGA sample is an unbiased subset
of the Kepler red giant sample.

We note that the analysis of the SAGA sample has its lim-
itations. The SAGA sample has a metallicity uncertainty of
0.18 dex, which is relatively large. So, the suggested range of
validity of the Galactic model, −0.5 < [Fe/H] < 0.0, is sub-
ject to this uncertainty in metallicity. The good match of κM
in −0.5 < [Fe/H] < 0.0 occurs only after an ad-hoc correc-
tion of 2% to νmax. This correction is not a prescription for a
global change to the scaling relation, but is a guide to quantify
the differences between model predictions and observations.
We note, it is possible that different groups of stars (e.g., red
clump and red giant branch), have different correction factors
that negate each other. This would make such global correc-
tion factor unphysical.

alongside the distribution of the full Kepler red giant sample (green).

4. REVISITING THE ASTEROSEISMIC SCALING RELATIONS
Our results in the previous sections show that corrections
to the scaling relations can improve the agreement between
observed seismic masses and those predicted by Galaxia. The
main correction was to use f∆ν from the grid of stellar mod-
els. Additionally, we investigated a correction of the form
fνmax = 1.02, speciﬁcally for the red giants. We now com-
pare the stellar properties like mass and radius, inferred using
seismology with and without corrections to the scaling rela-
tions, against ﬁve benchmark cases where measurements are
available independent of seismology. The results are summa-
rized in Table 1 and we discuss them in detail below.

Table 1 shows that for all ﬁve benchmark cases, the standard
uncorrected scaling relations, with f∆ν = 1 and fνmax = 1
(option 1), overestimate the mass as compared to non-seismic
estimates. We investigate different combinations of the fol-
and fνmax = 1.02 (options
lowing corrections, f∆ν = f Grid
∆ν
2-4). We see that when the f Grid
correction is used, either
∆ν
with fνmax = 1 or 1.02 (options 3-4), the seismic estimates
match the non-seismic estimates to within 2σ. Also, when us-
ing f Grid
∆ν , the cluster NGC 6791 is the only benchmark case
that favors fνmax = 1 (option 3) instead of fνmax = 1.02 (op-
tion 4). To conclude, the non seismic estimates that we study
here, support the use of f Grid
∆ν . Four out of ﬁve benchmark
cases studied also support the use of fνmax = 1.02.

aThe predicted values are assuming the star to be a red giant branch stars, the values in square brackets are assuming the star to be a red clump star

Miglio et al. (2012) used asteroseismology from Kepler
data to measure the masses of the red giant branch and red
clump stars in NGC6791. Their estimates of masses for the
red giant branch stars were higher than found by Brogaard
et al. (2012). Using photometry, temperature, and distance
modulus, Miglio et al. (2012) also measured the radii of the
stars independently of asteroseismology. For the red giant
branch stars, they found the radius estimated from photometry
to be in agreement with those estimated by asteroseismology,
but for the red clump stars they found the seismic estimate
to be smaller by about 5%. Miglio et al. (2012) noted that
the factor f∆ν suggested by their stellar models was higher
for red clump stars compared to red giant branch stars. This
prompted Miglio et al. (2012) to adopt f∆ν = 1.0 for red gi-
ant branch stars and 1.027 for red clump stars, which brought
the seismic and non seismic estimates of radius in agreement
with each other. When, using f∆ν = f Grid
from our stel-
∆ν
lar models, we also ﬁnd f∆ν to be higher for red clump stars
(Figure 4). However, for NGC6791, on average the red giant
branch stars have (cid:104)f∆ν(cid:105) = 0.974 while the red clump stars
have (cid:104)f∆ν(cid:105) = 0.999 (close to unity). While the relative dif-
ference between the corrections for the two groups of stars
is similar to what Miglio et al. (2012) found, our f∆ν values
are lower and hence our seismic estimates of radius, for both
red giant branch and red clump stars, do not match the non-
seismic estimates. However, a change of 0.15 mag in distance
modulus, which has an uncertainty of 0.06 mag, is enough
to bring the photometric and seismic estimates of radius in
agreement.

Our estimates of mass, using f∆ν = f Grid

∆ν , are shown in
Figure 11, which match well with estimates of Brogaard et al.
(2012) (dashed line). When estimating the average mass of
the red giant branch stars, we restricted them to be hotter
than the coldest red clump star (hence less luminous than red
clump stars) to avoid giants whose evolutionary state is am-

by stellar models (option 3 from Table 1). The red clump stars have a slightly
lower mass on average. The mean mass is computed for stars with Teﬀ >
4400 K (left of dotted line) to exclude asymptotic giant branch and highly
evolved red giant branch stars that might have undergone mass loss.

to test the asteroseismic scaling relations. Of the 13 candi-
date eclipsing binaries with a pulsating red giant component
currently found in the Kepler data (Gaulme et al. 2013), KIC
8410637 and KIC 9246715 are the only ones that have mass
and radius measured from the analysis of the eclipses in the
light curves. It can be seen from Table 1 that correcting the
scaling relations, with f∆ν = f Grid
and fνmax = 1.02, brings
∆ν
the seismic masses and radii in better agreement with the dy-
namical masses and radii. The correction factor f∆ν, which
depends upon the evolutionary state of a star, is different for
a red giant branch star and a red clump star. Currently we do
not have any information about the evolutionary state of these
stars. In Table 1 the values corresponding to a red clump star
are shown in square brackets. It can be seen that for both the
stars the dynamical estimates of mass and radius favor them
to be red giant branch stars rather than red clump stars.

wavelengths from instruments like CHARA (ten Brummelaar
et al. 2005) allows one to measure angular diameters of
stars with 1-2% accuracy (Huber et al. 2012).
If distance
is known, one can convert angular diameter to radius.
However, accurate reliable distances, e.g., from parallax
measurements, are currently only available for bright nearby
stars. HD185351, with V=5.18, is the third brightest star
observed by Kepler (Johnson et al. 2014) and is also nearby
with a parallax-based distance of 40.83 ± 0.36 pc. By com-
bining this distance with the interferometric measurement
of the angular diameter, Johnson et al. (2014) estimated the
radius to be 4.97 ± 0.07R(cid:12). This estimate is slightly larger
than the asteroseismic estimate of 5.35 ± 0.2R(cid:12) based on
uncorrected scaling relations. With corrections, f∆ν = f Grid
∆ν
and fνmax = 1.02, the asteroseismic estimate of radius is
5.23 ± 0.2R(cid:12). which agrees better with the interferometric
and parallax-based measurement.

5. CHANGING THE GALACTIC MODEL

In Section 4, we saw that the predictions of the Galaxia
model do not match the mass distribution of observed red gi-
ant stars from Kepler. We investigated corrections to the as-
teroseismic scaling relations and found that the corrections
improve the agreement with observations but do not make
the disagreements go away completely. We now investigate
the changes that would be required in the Galactic model to
match the asteroseismic information from Kepler. The main
mismatch is that the Galactic model overpredicts the number
of low mass stars. The age of a red giant star is inversely
related to its mass, so if we change the star-formation rate to
reduce the relative fraction of old stars, the predicted mass dis-
tribution should shift towards higher masses and consequently
improve the agreement.

In Figure 13, each row corresponds to a different Galactic
model, and for each model we plot the distribution of κM ,
νmax, and J − KS color. The distribution of κM , νmax is
for the red giant sample, while the J − KS distribution is
for stars in KIC with apparent magnitudes r < 14. The κM
distributions are shown both without (ﬁrst column) and with
correction (second column) to the ∆ν scaling relation. Panels
in the top row (Figure 13a-d) show the default Galaxia model.
This has a thin disc with a constant star formation rate for age
between 0 to 10 Gyr and a separate thick disc with age be-
tween 10 to 11 Gyr. In the second row (Figure 13e-h) and the

and fνmax = 1.02. The black dots are masses
when no correction is applied to the ∆ν scaling relation and resemble the
estimates of Epstein et al. (2014) with νmax,(cid:12) = 3140µHz, which is equiv-

4.2. Metal poor giants in APOKASC

Epstein et al. (2014) studied asteroseismic masses of metal-
poor stars observed by Kepler and APOGEE that were part
of the APOKASC sample (Pinsonneault et al. 2014). Nine
stars were found with [M/H] < −1. Seven of them were
labelled as halo stars and the other two as thick disc stars,
based on their kinematics. By making some assumptions on
[α/Fe] and age of these stars, Epstein et al. (2014) predicted
their masses. They adopted a range of 0.2 – 0.4 for [α/Fe],
10 – 13.77 Gyr for the age of the halo and 8 – 13.77 Gyr
for the age of the thick disc. An approximate reproduction of
these predicted masses by us is shown as the shaded region
in Figure 12. Next, Epstein et al. (2014) measured the mean
offset of seismic masses from these predictions, and found
them to be ∆M = 0.17 ± 0.05M(cid:12). They used νmax,(cid:12) =
3140µHz, which is the method-speciﬁc value for the OCT
method (Hekker et al. 2010) used by them. This choice is
equivalent to fνmax = 1.016 in our terminology (Equation 6),
because we use νmax,(cid:12) = 3090µHz. Our results, adopting the
OCT values for the stars, with fνmax = 1.02 are shown in Fig-
ure 12 and Table 1. The results, both with and without f Grid
correction, are shown (options 2 and 4). We ﬁnd that adopting
the f Grid
correction lowers the mass on average by 0.15 M(cid:12)
and brings ∆M closer to the expected value of zero. If the
OCT method really has method speciﬁc systematics then the
above results do not suggest any additional correction to the
νmax scaling relation besides that required to acccount for a
higher value of νmax,(cid:12). For 8 out of 9 metal poor giants we
also have ∆ν and νmax estimates using the SYD pipeline, for
which νmax,(cid:12) = 3090µHz. Results for these are also shown
in Table 1. Here, option 4 is the best, this supports correction
to both the ∆ν and the νmax scaling relations. A correction to
the νmax scaling relation was also suggested by Epstein et al.
(2014), based on two metal poor stars, ν Indi (Bedding et al.
2006) and KIC 7341231 (Deheuvels et al. 2012).

KIC (last column) for different Galactic models. Each row corresponds to a different Galactic model and from top to bottom these are (a-d) Galaxia, (e-h) Galaxia
including only stars less than 10 Gyr old, (i-l) Galaxia including only stars less than 8 Gyr old, and (m-p) TRILEGAL. The κM distribution in the ﬁrst column
is computed without any correction to the ∆ν scaling relation whereas in the second a correction is used. For the top two rows, a correction to the ∆ν scaling
relation is required to match the mass distributions while for the bottom two rows no correction is required. The Galactic models that match the observed mass
distribution of the red giant sample do not match the observed (J − Ks) color distribution of stars with r < 14 in KIC. This is because such models have more
younger stars, which extend the blue wing of the (J − Ks) color distribution.
third row (Figure 13i-l) the star formation rate in Galaxia is
truncated such that there are no stars older than 10 and 8 Gyr,
respectively. In the bottom row (Figure 13m-p) we use the
default version of TRILEGAL, which has a two step star for-
mation rate. Between 1 to 4 Gyr the star formation rate is 1.5
times higher than at other times (Girardi et al. 2005). We ap-
plied the same selection procedure on the TRILEGAL stars as
we did for Galaxia stars, that is, g band correction, estimation
of stellar parameters from photometry using the SCP code,
and then applying the selection function as discussed in Sec-
tion 3.1. The age distributions of the red giant sample, as pre-
dicted by Galaxia and TRILEGAL, are shown in Figure 14.
The TRILEGAL model clearly has more younger stars (in the
range 1 – 4 Gyr) than any Galaxia based model considered
here. So, going from top row to bottom row, the percentage of
young stars in the model increases. As expected, the predicted
mass distributions, as shown in the ﬁrst and second columns,
are found to shift towards higher masses as one goes from top
to bottom along each column.

ative to the default Galaxia model shown in the ﬁrst row (Fig-
ure 13a-d). If we remove the very oldest stars (second row/
Figure 13e-h), the match between the Galactic model and the
observations is better with the ∆ν correction (panel f) than
without (panel e). Hence, if the correction factor is used, only
stars older than 10 Gyr, which is 19% of the Galaxia sam-
ple, need to be discarded to bring the models into reasonable
agreement with the data. If we remove older stars more ag-
gressively (third row/ Figure 13e-h) we see the opposite ef-
fect; the match is better when no correction is applied (com-
pare panels i and j). Hence, if the correction factor is not used,
stars older than 8 Gyr, which is 32% of the Galaxia sample,
need to be discarded to reach a reasonable match. These re-
sults highlight the degeneracy between the star formation rate
and the ∆ν correction factor to the scaling relations. Since,
a correction to the νmax scaling relation also alters the mass
distribution, the factor fνmax will also be degenerate with the
star formation rate. The bottom row (Figure 13m-p)) shows
the TRILEGAL model, whose star formation rate is closer
to the Galaxia model in third row Figure 13i-l). Similar to
that Galaxia model, the predicted mass distribution of TRI-

specially for red giants whose structure is not homologous to
that of the Sun. In previous studies it has been shown that ∆ν
estimated from theoretically calculated oscillation frequen-
cies differs from the simple ∆ν ∝ ρ1/2 scaling with density.
To investigate this, we estimated corrections to the ∆ν scal-
ing relation as a function of mass, metallicity, temperature and
evolutionary state, using a grid of stellar models. We found
that the Galactic model that best matched the photometry ﬁt-
ted the asteroseismic data better if the ∆ν corrections were
implemented. We also studied ﬁve benchmark cases, where
non-seismic estimates of mass are available, and for all of
them the use of the ∆ν correction brought seismic estimates
closer to non-seismic estimates. This provides additional sup-
port for the ∆ν correction.

Analysis of the SAGA sample, which provides metallicity
for an unbiased subsample of Kepler giants, allowed us to ex-
plore how the agreement between the Galactic predictions and
observed seismic information depends on metallicity. We ﬁnd
that the best match of the Galaxia model with observations is
in the range −0.5 < [Fe/H] < 0.0. However, in addition to
correction to the ∆ν scaling relation, a 2% correction to the
νmax scaling relation is also required. The correction factor
serves to quantify the difference between theory and observa-
tions and should not be used as a prescription for changing
the seismic scaling relation. The correction is based purely
on comparing the distribution of masses, and it is possible
that red giant branch and red clump stars have opposite cor-
rections that cancel each other.

Even after using the correction to the ∆ν scaling relation,
the Galactic model of Galaxia that best matches the photo-
metric information fails to match the seismic information for
giants. The mismatch is minimal for Teﬀ < 4700 but is sig-
niﬁcant for Teﬀ > 4700. In general, Galaxia tends to over-
estimate the number of low mass stars, which implies that
Galaxia overpredicts the number of old stars. Further cor-
rections to asteroseismic scaling relations is certainly a pos-
sibility to resolve the discrepancy, as is a modiﬁcation to the
Galactic model.
If the scaling relations along with correc-
tions suggested by stellar models are correct, then at least
20% of the oldest stars in Galaxia have to be discarded to
bring the predicted mass distributions in agreement with ob-
servations. However, altering the star formation rate as sug-
gested above makes the color distributions disagree with ob-
servations. There are other model parameters that we have
not yet explored, which can also alter the mass distribution of
stars, such as, the age-scale height relation, age scale radius
relation and the initial mass function. It is possible that some
combination of these can explain both the photometric infor-
mation of stars as well as the asteroseismic information. This
should be explored in future. Also, to resolve degeneracies
between parameters governing the model, one would need to
explore observational data from multiple sources, like, astero-
seismic, photometric, spectroscopic and astrometric missions.
Other than Galaxia, we also compared the predictions of
the TRILEGAL Galactic model with the Kepler data. While
Galaxia matches the photometry of stars in the KIC, TRILE-
GAL could not; it overestimated the number of blue stars. The
peak in the νmax distribution for TRILEGAL was also shifted
compared to the Kepler observations. Suppressing older stars
in Galaxia, also leads to overestimation of blue stars as seen in
TRILEGAL. This suggests that TRILEGAL overestimates the
occurrence of younger stars. However, TRILEGAL matches
the mass distribution of Kepler red giants, provided no correc-

FIG. 14.— Age distribution of the Kepler red giants as predicted by Galaxia
and TRILEGAL. The peak in the Galaxia distribution between 10-11 Gyr is
due to thick disc stars. In Galaxia, the thin disc has a constant star formation
rate, which is reﬂected in the age distribution. The TRILEGAL model in
comparison has more younger stars and lacks stars older than 8 Gyr. The
thick disc, spanning 11 to 12 Gyr, is also less prominent in TRILEGAL.
LEGAL matches with observations, provided the correction
factor f Grid

is not used.

The models in the bottom three rows of Figure 13 match
the observed mass distribution better than the default Galaxia
model shown in the top row (Figure 13a,b). However, these
models do not match the (J − Ks) color distribution (fourth
column), especially its blue wing where the match becomes
progressively worse going from top to bottom. This is be-
cause, these models correspond to an increasingly higher frac-
tion of young stars. The younger stars are more blue (hotter)
giving rise to an increased number of stars in the blue wing of
the color distribution. In addition to the mismatch with the ob-
served color distribution, the TRILEGAL model, also shows
a mismatch with the observed νmax distribution. Note that the
corrections in 2.1.1 have no effect on the J − Ks distribu-
tions shown here. This is because any potential inaccuracies
in photometry are related to Kepler u, g, r, i, and z bands and
not the 2MASS J, H, and Ks bands. Also, issues related to
the red giant selection function, as discussed in 2.2 and 3.1,
also have no effect on the J−Ks distributions shown here, be-
cause the color distribution is shown for a simple magnitude
limited sample satisfying r < 14.

The star formation rate is not the only part of the model
that can alter the mass distribution. Changing the age scale
height and age scale radius relation in the Galactic model will
alter the age distribution and thereby the mass distribution of
stars selected with the Kepler selection function. Changing
the initial mass function of stars in the Galactic model can also
alter the mass distribution. Clearly, in future, when attempting
to ﬁt a Galactic model to observed data, one should take all of
the above mentioned factors into account.

6. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we explored the prospect of using astero-
seismic information of red giants to constrain stellar popu-
lation synthesis-based models of the Milky Way. We used a
sample of about 13,000 red giants from the Kepler mission.
The large sample size allowed us to test the Galactic models
with asteroseismic data at a level that was not possible before.
For the ﬁrst time, within the framework of stellar population
synthesis-based modelling, we also investigated changes to
the Galactic model and the asteroseismic relations.

The asteroseismic scaling relations provide a practical way
to determine mass and radius from average asteroseismic pa-
rameters like ∆ν and νmax for a large number of stars. How-
ever, the range of validity of these relations is not yet clear,

tions are applied to ∆ν.

Although we have been able to derive a selection function
for the Kepler red giant sample that seems to be representative
of the population, we caution that it might have some inaccu-
racies given the complex selection procedure involved in the
actual selection of targets. Hence, it is important to verify the
current ﬁndings using an independent sample of stars obeying
an unambiguous selection function, such as, the red giants ob-
served by K2 for galactic archaeology purposes, where stars
have been targeted with a well deﬁned color magnitude limits
(Stello et al. 2015b).

To conclude, our results clearly demonstrate that the size
and quality of asteroseismic data provided by Kepler can, in
principle, provide good constraints on Galactic model param-
eters. However, further work is required to validate the ac-
curacy of asteroseismic scaling relation-based mass estimates
for giants and to explore a wider variety of changes to the
Galactic model input. Missions like K2, TESS, and PLATO
are going to increase the seismic sample size by two orders of
magnitude. There are also plans to get high resolution spec-
troscopic data for many of these stars, which will help to ex-

plore the connection between age and chemistry. Such data,
when combined with distances from Gaia, will be invaluable
for modelling the Milky Way and trying to understand its for-
mation.
