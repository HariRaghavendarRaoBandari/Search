ABSTRACT

We present the ﬁrst global 3D simulations of thermal convection in the

oblate envelopes of rapidly-rotating solar-type stars. This has been achieved

by exploiting the capabilities of the new Compressible High-ORder Unstruc-

tured Spectral diﬀerence (CHORUS) code. We consider rotation rates up to

85% of the critical (breakup) rotation rate, which yields an equatorial radius

that is up to 17% larger than the polar radius. This substantial oblateness en-

hances the disparity between polar and equatorial modes of convection. We

ﬁnd that the convection redistributes the heat ﬂux emitted from the outer sur-

face, leading to an enhancement of the heat ﬂux in the polar and equatorial

regions. This ﬁnding implies that lower-mass stars with convective envelopes

may not have darker equators as predicted by classical gravity darkening ar-

guments. The vigorous high-latitude convection also establishes elongated

axisymmetric circulation cells and zonal jets in the polar regions. Though the

overall amplitude of the surface diﬀerential rotation, ∆Ω, is insensitive to the

oblateness, the oblateness does limit the fractional kinetic energy contained in

the diﬀerential rotation to no more than 61%. Furthermore, we argue that this

level of diﬀerential rotation is not enough to have a signiﬁcant impact on the

oblateness of the star.

INTRODUCTION

Most stars are born spinning rapidly. Observations of young clusters reveal a wide

range of rotation rates, with some stars spinning more than 100 times faster than the

Sun (e.g. Soderblom et al. 1993; Meibom et al. 2009; Hartman et al. 2010). This scatter

is generally attributed to the vortical nature of the turbulent interstellar clouds from

which these stars form. Though much of the initial angular momentum is lost during

the gravitational collapse of a protostellar core, the dramatic decrease in the moment of

inertia during the collapse is enough to impart a substantial rotational velocity in a large

fraction of young stars. As the stars age, torques from magnetized stellar winds cause

them to spin down and this reduces the scatter of the general population (Skumanich

1972; Soderblom et al. 2001; Barnes 2003; Meibom et al. 2015; R´eville et al. 2015).

The rapid rotation of young stars can have a dramatic inﬂuence on their internal

structure and dynamics. In the most extreme cases, the centrifugal force can alter the

stars’ shape, causing it to be signiﬁcantly oblate. Models of rotating stars suggest that the

eﬀects of rapid rotation and oblateness can alter the stars’s convective and radiative heat

transport, reduce their luminosities, induce shearing instabilities and global circulations,

and modify their rotational and compositional evolution (Zahn 1992; Pinsonneault 1997;

Meynet & Maeder 2000; Maeder & Meynet 2001; MacGregor et al. 2007; Espinosa Lara

& Rieutord 2013). Much of this work has focused on high-mass stars because of their

short lifetimes, which makes them intrinsically more likely for fast rotation to play an

important evolutionary role from birth to death, when they explode as supernovae and

enrich the Galaxy with heavy elements. High-mass stars are also luminous and large,

which makes them relatively easy to observe. In the last ﬁfteen years, researchers have

– 4 –

been able to directly detect the oblate shapes of several rapidly-rotating, massive stars by

means of optical and infrared interferometry (van Belle et al. 2001; McAlister et al. 2005;

Monnier et al. 2007; Zhao et al. 2009; van Belle 2012). More direct detections are likely

to be made in the future as observations continue to improve (Nu˜nez & Domiciano de

Souza 2015).

One of the major theoretical predictions that has been addressed by these observations

is the phenomenon of gravity darkening, which was introduced nearly a century ago in a

pioneering paper by von Zeipel (1924). For a massive star with a radiative outer envelope,

von Zeipel argued that the eﬀective temperature of the stellar surface should scale as
Te f f ∝ gβ
e f f , where β = 1/4 and ge f f is the eﬀective gravity, equal to the Newtonian
gravity plus the centrifugal force. This in turn implies that the radiative energy ﬂux
emitted from the stellar surface scales as F ∝ g4β
e f f . Since the centrifugal force acts to
reduce ge f f at the equator, gravity darkening predicts that the equatorial regions should

be darker than the polar regions. Though observations have conﬁrmed the existence of

gravity darkening, they suggest that the exponent may be somewhat less than predicted,
with β ≈ 0.13-0.25 (van Belle et al. 2001; Domiciano de Souza et al. 2005; McAlister
et al. 2005; Monnier et al. 2007; Zhao et al. 2009; van Belle 2012). Lower-mass, late-type

stars with convective envelopes are also expected to exhibit gravity darkening but again,

with a smaller latitudinal variation than that predicted by von Zeipel, with β possibly as

low as 0.08 (Lucy 1967; Espinosa Lara & Rieutord 2011). However, these expectations

are based on simpliﬁed models of convection, with little observational guidance.

Substantial progress has been made in recent years in modeling the structure of

rapidly rotating stars. A number of models have been used to investigate the eﬀects of

– 5 –

oblateness on stellar structure and evolution, with implications for asteroseismology

(Ostriker & Mark 1968; Jackson et al. 2004, 2005; Roxburgh 2004; MacGregor et al.

2007; Reese 2008; Reese et al. 2009; Zahn et al. 2010; Deupree 2011; Ouazzani et al.

2015). Though these models are ostensibly 2D, the thermodynamic quantities only

depend on the eﬀective gravitational potential. Furthermore, like most stellar structure

models, these models do not address the internal dynamics of oblate stars; they solve

only for the hydrostatic structure using a mixing-length formulation for convection,

though some do include idealized cylindrical or shellular diﬀerential rotation proﬁles.

Kong et al. (2013) took a somewhat diﬀerent approach, calculating the non-spherical

shape and internal structure of a rapidly rotating gaseous body using a three-dimensional,

ﬁnite-element code with an unstructured grid. But again, the ﬂuid dynamics was not

considered.

The ﬁrst numerical model (to our knowledge) capable of capturing the internal

dynamics of oblate stars is the ESTER (Evolution STEllaire en Rotation) code (Espinosa

Lara & Rieutord 2007; Rieutord & Espinosa Lara 2009; Rieutord & Espinosa Lara 2013;

Espinosa Lara & Rieutord 2013). ESTER solves the axisymmetric, steady-state ﬂuid

equations self-consistently, taking into account nuclear energy generation, diﬀerential

rotation and meridional circulation. However, convection is still treated using a mixing-

length formulation. Furthermore, published ESTER simulations are currently limited to

high-mass stars with convective cores (M > 1.7M(cid:12)). There have been many global 3D

hydrodynamic (HD) and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of convection in the

envelopes of lower-mass stars that address the rapid rotation regime (e.g. Ballot et al.

2007; Brown et al. 2008; Miesch & Toomre 2009; K¨apyl¨a et al. 2011; Guerrero et al.

2013; Gastine et al. 2014; Fan & Fang 2014; Hotta et al. 2015; Featherstone & Miesch

– 6 –

2015; Karak et al. 2015). However, these do not take into account the oblateness caused

by the centrifugal force.

In this study, we present the ﬁrst 3D HD simulations of convection in the oblate

envelopes of rapidly-rotating solar-type stars. These simulations are performed using the

Compressible High-ORder Unstructured Spectral diﬀerence (CHORUS) code recently

introduced by Wang et al. (2015, hereafter WLM15). We focus in particular on the

inﬂuence of the oblateness on the convective structure, heat transport, mean ﬂows, and

the thermodynamic stratiﬁcation.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we discuss the CHORUS code

and its application to model oblate spheriodal geometries. We follow this in Section 3

with a description of the numerical experiments that we have performed, which compare

oblate simulations at varying rotation rates with their spherical counterparts. We consider

rotation rates up to 0.85Ωcrit where Ωcrit is the critical angular velocity at which the

outward centrifugal force at the equator equals the inward gravitational force. We then

present our results, focusing ﬁrst on the convective structure and energetics (Section 4),

then on the energy transport (Section 5) and ﬁnally on the mean ﬂows and associated

thermal gradients (Section 6). We summarize our results, conclusions and future plans in

Section 7.

2. MODELING THE PROBLEM

Modeling solar and stellar convection is challenging because the ﬂow is turbulent and

a vast range of spatial and temporal scales are involved. The Reynolds number Re = Ud/ν

– 7 –

(where U and d are characteristic velocity and length scales and ν is the kinematic

viscosity) is typically very high so direct numerical simulations that eﬀectively resolve

all scales in the convective envelope are far beyond today’s computational aﬀordability.

In this study, we only aim to capture large-scale dynamics which are crucial in order

to establish convection, diﬀerential rotation, and thermal ﬂux balance. To do so, the

three-dimensional CHORUS code is employed to perform a series of global simulations.

CHORUS solves the equations of hydrodynamics using the high-order spectral diﬀerence

method based on unstructured grids (WLM15). It can be naturally extended to deal with

complex geometries including oblate spheriodal shells. In what follows we will generally

refer to a spherical polar coordinate system (r, θ, φ), although the CHORUS code employs

a Cartesian coordinate system to represent a spherical or oblate spheriodal geometry using

an unstructured mesh (Sec. 2.5).

2.1. Hydrodynamic Equations

We consider an ideal gas within an oblate spheroidal shell uniformly rotating at
a constant rate Ω0 about the z−axis. For simplicity, we assume the bulk of mass is
inside the inner radius of the oblate spheroidal shell, giving the gravitational acceleration
g = −gˆr = − GM
r2 ˆr, where G is the gravitational constant, M is the interior mass and ˆr is the
radial unit vector. In slowly rotating solar-type stars, the centrifugal force has typically

been neglected in the momentum equation considering its suﬃciently small magnitude

relative to the buoyancy force (e.g. Miesch et al. 2000; Jones et al. 2011). However, in

rapidly rotating stars, the centrifugal force is comparable to gravity and has a signiﬁcant

contribution to stellar structure. Thus, in addition to the Coriolis force, we include the

– 8 –

centrifugal force in the hydrodynamic equations. The resulting equations in the rotating

reference frame are

respectively. E is the total energy per unit volume and is deﬁned as E = p

τi j = 2ρν

ei j − 1
3

∇·uδi j

,

(4)

where ei j is the strain rate tensor and ν is the kinematic viscosity. The term u·τ in
Equation (3) represents viscous heating. The diﬀusive ﬂux f is treated in the form of
f = −κrρCp∇T − κρT∇S where the ﬁrst component is a radiation diﬀusion ﬂux with
the molecular radiation diﬀusion coeﬃcient κr and Cp is the speciﬁc heat at constant

pressure. The second component is the entropy diﬀusion due to unresolved, subgrid-scale

convective motions. This is a crude but commonly used representation of subgrid-scale

(SGS) heat transport (Miesch et al. 2000; Jones et al. 2011). S is the speciﬁc entropy.

The kinematic viscosity ν and the thermal diﬀusivity κ are assumed to be constant in

time and space (independent of radius), with magnitudes as speciﬁed in section 3. The

radiative diﬀusivity κr peaks at the inner boundary and decreases outward. It is computed
from the temperature and density distribution according to the expression κr = κoT 6.5ρ−2.
Since the initial ρ and T proﬁles depend only on the Roche potential Φ (see section 2.3),

– 9 –

κr is also initially a function of Φ alone. It does evolve in time along with ρ and T but
variations along a potential surface remain relatively small so κr ≈ κr(Φ). The value of κo
is chosen such that the total ﬂux passing through the lower boundary is equal to the stellar

luminosity L (see section 2.4).

The use of the total energy equation (3) is advantageous from the point of view

of the conservation of energy but it can pose problems in stellar interiors where the

stratiﬁcation is adiabatic to within about one part in 106. To capture the small departures

from adiabaticity that drive the convection requires a very accurate numerical method.

However, as discussed in Section 3, we have artiﬁcially increased the luminosity in

our models in order to achieve more tractable values of the Mach number. This has

the additional advantage that it increases the superadiabatic entropy gradient. Thus, the
nondimensional amplitude of the entropy gradient, (D/Cp)∇S , is only a factor of 600 less
than the nondimensional temperature gradient (D/T)∇T. In other words, the departure
from adiabatic stratiﬁcation is more than one part in 103. We estimate the accuracy of our
spectral diﬀerence method (described in Section 2.2) to be at least 10−7 for length scales
on the order of the entropy gradient and we see no signs of spurious behavior.

2.2. Numerical Method

In the CHORUS code, the spectral diﬀerence (SD) method is used to discretize

Equations (1)-(3) in space by using their original strong form (diﬀerential form) (Liang

et al. 2009). In contrast, the traditional Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method starts

from the weak (integrated) form of these equations (e.g. Cockburn & Shu 1998). The

SD method can be viewed as a particular form of nodal DG method (May 2011). To

– 10 –

discretize these equations in space, the computational domain is divided into a collection

of non-overlapping hexahedral elements. These elements in physical coordinates (x, y,

z) are then transformed to a unit cube (ξ, η, ζ) using an isoparametric mapping with

quadratic relations. Consequently, the governing equations are transformed accordingly

through Jacobian matrices. In the unit cube, two sets of points are deﬁned, namely the

solution and ﬂux points. In each coordinate direction of (ξ, η, ζ), N solution points
are chosen to be the Chebyshev-Gauss-quadrature points and (N − 1) ﬂux points are
selected to be roots of the Legendre polynomial plus two end points. Then the solution

and ﬂux polynomials can be built through Lagrange interpolation basis functions. In

order to deal with ﬂux discontinuities across element interfaces, an approximate Riemann

solver (Rusanov or Lax-Friedrichs scheme) and BR1 (Bassi & Rebay 1997) scheme are

employed for inviscid and viscous ﬂuxes respectively. Over each elemental interface,
N × N ﬂux points are needed to construct both inviscid Riemman and viscous BR1 ﬂuxes
where N is the order of the accuracy of the SD method. The CHORUS code has proven to

be particularly attractive for parallel computing (WLM15). The high-order SD method is
locally intensive in term of computation associated with N × N × N solutions points per
element and requires a light amount of communication across elemental interfaces with
N × N ﬂux points. For temporal discretization, a fourth-order accurate, strong-stability
preserving ﬁve-stage Runge-Kutta scheme is employed (Ruuth & Spiteri 2004). For

further details on the numerical method see WLM15.

Initial Conditions

For anelastic codes, the initial conditions are often based on a 1D, unstable,

equilibrium, polytropic solution derived from the governing equations with an imposed

superadiabatic entropy gradient, ∂S /∂r < 0 (Jones et al. 2011). However, this approach

does not apply here for two reasons. One is the exclusion of the centrifugal force. Taking

this into account in the initial hydrostatic balance requires a 2D setup (both radial and

latitudinal directions) which poses a problem for anelastic codes that generally expand

about a 1D reference state. The second reason that we cannot use a typical anelastic setup

is the compressible nature of CHORUS. In an anelastic code, the superadiabatic entropy

gradient can be incorporated into the thermodynamic perturbations and decoupled from

the speciﬁcation of the reference state. Since CHORUS does not linearize the equations

about a reference state, this does not apply.

For these reasons, we take a diﬀerent approach. Instead, we initialize CHORUS

with a 2D, hydrostatic, adiabatic stratiﬁcation (∂S /∂r = 0). This has the advantage

that it can be deﬁned analytically, even for oblate geometries. However, in contrast to

some anelastic setups, this initial state is not an equilibrium solution to the equations

because it does not satisfy the steady-state energy equation. In particular, there is a

non-zero convergence of the radiative ﬂux which heats the plasma and establishes the

superadiabatic entropy gradient that eventually triggers convection. In this section we

describe how this initialization is accomplished for both spherical and oblate spheroidal

shells.

where θ is the colatitude. We assume that initial stratiﬁcation is adiabatic such that

P = Cργ,

where C is a constant. The hydrostatic equation reduced from the momentum conservation
Equation (2) in the absence of ﬂow motion (∂/∂t = 0, u = 0) is

∇P = −ρ∇Φ.

These equations are supplemented with the ideal gas law

p = RρT ,

(7)

(8)

where R is the speciﬁc gas constant. We obtain a solution to Equations (5)-(8), by

introducing a polytropic stratiﬁcation that can be regarded as an oblate generalization

of the spherically symmetric polytropic solutions described by Jones et al. (2011). The

initial proﬁles for pressure P, density ρ, and temperature T are speciﬁed as

.

(12)

– 13 –

Here Φi and Φo are the values of Φ on the inner and outer surfaces respectively. In terms
of the inner and outer radius at the poles, rip and rop, they are given by Φi = −GM/rip and
Φo = −GM/rop. In practice, we specify rip and rop and then solve Equation (5) to ﬁnd the
equipotential surfaces Φi and Φo that pass through these polar radii. We then deﬁne these

equipotential surfaces as the inner and outer boundary of the domain (see section 2.5).

Note that Equations (9)-(11) reduce to the 1D polytropic solutions of Jones et al.

(2011) if the centrifugal force term is omitted from the eﬀective gravitational potential

in Equation (5). As shown there, Nρ corresponds to the number of density scales heights

across the shell. The initial proﬁle is completely speciﬁed by choosing the parameters

M, rip, rop, Ω0, γ, Cp, ρi, and Nρ. For our oblate simulations, we use the 2D proﬁles in

Equations (9)-(11) and for our spherical shell simulations we use the 1D proﬁles of Jones

et al. (2011) which can be obtained from (9)-(11) by setting Ω0 = 0. Since we wish to
model solar-type stars, we use appropriate parameter values of Nρ = 3, ρi = 0.21 g cm−3,
M = M(cid:12) = 1.99 × 1033 g, CP = 3.5 × 108 erg g−1 K−1, and γ = 5/3. Note also that the
initialization procedure described here implies that the oblate geometries will have both a

larger volume and a larger mass than their spherical counterparts (see section 3).

These polytropic, adiabatic initial conditions do not satisfy the Schwarzschild

criterion for convective instability, which requires a negative (superadiabatic) radial

entropy gradient (∂S /∂r < 0). Furthermore, the Rayleigh number Ra is subcritical. Thus,

convection will not occur immediately. However, as noted at the beginning of this section,
there is a ﬁxed radiative heat ﬂux ∝ −κr∇T that carries the stellar luminosity in through
the bottom boundary (see also sections 2.1, 2.4 and 5.1). The convergence of this heat ﬂux

heats the plasma in the shell, raising its temperature. Since the temperature at the top is

– 14 –

ﬁxed (see section 2.4), this heating of the plasma increases the temperature gradient. Soon

the temperature gradient becomes both superadiabatic and supercritical, and convection

ensues. The temperature and entropy gradients will eventually equilibrate when the

simulation achieves ﬂux balance, such that the combined convective and diﬀusive energy

ﬂuxes carry the full stellar luminosity through the entire shell (see section 5.1).

Fig. 1.— Evolution of the vertical entropy gradient in one of the simulations (s60). Shown
is the horizonally-averaged normal entropy gradient ∇S·n as a function of Φ/Φo, where
n is a unit vector normal to Φ isosurfaces. Each curve corresponds to a diﬀerent time, as

indicated.

This process is illustrated in Fig. 1, which shows how the entropy gradient in a

typical simulation (s60; see Table 1) evolves with time. It starts out adiabatic (∂S /∂r = 0),

but it quickly becomes superadiabatic (∂S /∂r < 0). The heating of the shell due to the

convergence of the radiative heat ﬂux not only increases the temperature, it also raises the

adiabat. This increases the negative entropy gradient throughout the shell, but particularly

near the upper boundary. By t ∼ 6 days, it becomes superadiabatic enough to trigger
convection (see Figs. 6 and 7 below). By t ∼ 50 days, the simulation has achieved ﬂux
balance and the entropy gradient has equilibrated.

2.4. Boundary Conditions

The inner and outer boundaries, Φ = Φi and Φ = Φo, are assumed to be impenetrable

and free of viscous shear stresses

and

u·n = 0,

(τ·n)×n = 0,

where n is the unit vector normal to equipotential surfaces Φ and pointing radially

outward.

At the bottom boundary a ﬁxed heat ﬂux is imposed such that

f = −κrρCp∇T − κρT∇S =

L
A

n

(Φ = Φi),

(13)

(14)

(15)

where L is the stellar luminosity and A is the area of the inner surface Φ = Φi. For the
spherical simulations, A = 4πr2
ip, but for the oblate simulations the area is greater than this
and is calculated numerically. Since ∇S·n ≈ 0 at Φ = Φi (see Fig. 1), this imposed heat
ﬂux is almost entirely due to the radiative diﬀusion term (∝ −κr∇T). The magnitude of κr
is speciﬁed such that Equation (15) is satisﬁed (see section 2.1).

At the upper boundary, Φ = Φo, the temperature is ﬁxed at the value speciﬁed by the

initial conditions (section 2.3).

2.5. Grids for Oblate Spheroidal Shells

In our model, the oblate outer surface of the star is deﬁned by the equipotential

surface Φ = Φo. In order to determine the outer surface shape, the polar (θ = 0) radius

r = rop is speciﬁed and kept unchanged. Then the potential at the pole can be compared

to that at an arbitrary polar angle θ. The resulting cubic equation for r is

Φo = −GM

= −GM
r

r2 sin2 θ.

(16)

By solving Equation (16) for r(Φo, θ), the axisymmetric (φ-independent) surface is

obtained. The inner equipotential surface can be computed in a similar way by replacing

the outer polar radius rop with the inner polar radius rip in Equation (16). The geometry of

an oblate spheroidal shell is then deﬁned by both inner and outer equipotential surfaces.

It is straightforward to generate grids for spherical shells by using commercial or

publicly available grid generation software (e.g. Gmsh). Spherical shells can also be

represented by a cubed-sphere grid (McCorquodale et al. 2015). However, it is very

challenging to generate grids for oblate spheroidal shells as deﬁned above because we

need to represent the curvature on both the bottom and top surfaces very accurately in

order to conserve mass, momentum, and energy. Here, an alternative approach has been

chosen. We ﬁrst generate a spherical shell grid with inner radius ri and outer radius ro

using Gmsh software (Gmsh 2015). The following procedure is taken to deform this

generated spherical shell grid to the desired oblate spheroidal shell grid with the rotating

rate Ω0.

1. In the spherical shell grid, for an arbitrary grid node point P, ﬁnd the points of

intersection between line OP and bottom and top surfaces. Denote these as A and B

– 17 –

respectively (see Fig. 2a). Note that point O is the center.

2. Calculate lengths of OA, OP, OB, AP and PB.

3. Deﬁne new bottom and top surfaces using Equation (16).

4. Keep the latitude and longitude of line OP(cid:48) identical to that of line OP and ﬁnd the

new intersection points A(cid:48) and B(cid:48) (see Fig. 2b).

5. As shown in Figure 3, the position of point P(cid:48) is obtained by satisfying

A(cid:48)P(cid:48)
P(cid:48)B(cid:48) =

AP
PB.

This procedure is performed at the preprocessing stage and all desired oblate

spheroidal shell grids with varying Ω0 (discussed in Section 3) are generated from a single

spherical shell grid. The generated oblate spheroidal shell grids are smooth and highly

accurate for both top and bottom surfaces as shown in Figure 5.

3. SIMULATION SUMMARY

The objective of this study is to investigate the eﬀects of oblateness on the properties

of the convection, heat transfer, and mean ﬂows in rapidly-rotating solar-type stars. To

this end, we have performed global-scale numerical simulations within spherical shells

(neglecting the centrifugal force) as well as oblate spheroidal shells that include the

centrifugal force in order to investigate the diﬀerence. Simulations within spherical shells

are labeled with leading letter s while those within oblate spheroidal shells are marked

with leading letter o as shown in Table 1. The computational domain for the spherical
shell extends from rip = 0.70R(cid:12) to rop = 0.95R(cid:12) where R(cid:12) = 6.9599 × 1010 cm is the solar
radius. The computational domains for the oblate spheroidal shells are derived from the

spherical shell using the approach described in Section 2.5. As described there, the inner

and outer radii at the poles are the same as in the spherical cases, but the depth of the

convection zone becomes wider at low latitudes due to the centrifugal distortion.

The low Mach numbers of deep stellar interiors pose a signiﬁcant challenge for fully

compressible codes. In particular, if explicit timestepping is used as is the case here, they

set strict limits on the size of the time step needed to satisfy the Courant-Freidrichs-Lewy

(CFL) condition. They also imply long thermal equilibration times. We address this

challenge as in previous simulations by artiﬁcially increasing the luminosity (e.g. K¨apyl¨a

et al. 2011, WLM15). This has the eﬀect of increasing the velocity amplitudes (which

scale roughly as L1/3) and decreasing the thermal relaxation time. For all simulations
reported here we use L = 6.4 × 104L(cid:12), where L(cid:12) = 3.846 × 1033 erg s−1 is the solar
luminosity. Thus, we estimate that the velocity amplitudes in our simulations are

artiﬁcially enhanced by about a factor of 40.

Our studies here explore a range of rotation rates from 60Ω(cid:12) to 120Ω(cid:12) (cases

s60-s120 and o60-o120) where Ω(cid:12) = 2.6 × 10−6 rad s−1 is the ﬁducial solar rotation rate.
However, the eﬀective Rossby number Ro = U/(2Ω0d) in our simulations is artiﬁcially

increased by roughly a factor of forty because of the larger convective velocity amplitudes

(relative to a star rotating at the same rotation rate). This problem is sometimes addresses

by artiﬁcially increasing the rotation rate along with the luminosity to achieve a desired

(cid:113) 8

27

Rossby number (e.g. K¨apyl¨a et al. 2011). However, we do not have that luxury here.

Since we include the centrifugal force, there is a critical rotation rate Ωcrit =

GM
r3
op
where the outward centrifugal acceleration of rotation equals the inward gravitational

acceleration (van Belle 2012). If the star were to rotate faster than Ωcrit it would break

up. Our range of rotation rates extends up to 85% of Ωcrit (see Table 1). In other words,

the oblateness of these stars is comparable to a real star rotating at these rotation rates but

the Rossby number is about a factor of forty higher. We could in principle remedy this

situation by adjusting M and G or we could simply accept that, though the convection in

our simulations is strongly rotationally constrained (Ro << 1; see Table 1), it is less so

than in a real star with the same rotation rate. For this initial study we follow the latter

– 23 –

approach and take it into account in our interpretation.

All of the simulations discussed here employ the third-order accuracy spectral

diﬀerence method on 393,216 hexahedral elements, resulting in a total of 10,616,832

degrees of freedom (DOFs). The values of ν and κ are selected to be small, but large

enough to ensure that the ﬂows are well resolved. Since we wish to focus on the eﬀects of
the oblateness, ν and κ are held ﬁxed at a value of ν = κ = 2.4 × 1014 cm2 s−1, implying
a Prandtl number Pr = ν/κ = 1. However, in order to make contact with the previous

global simulations of Brown et al. (2008), we also run a series of spherical simulations

in which ν and κ are reduced as the rotation rate is increased in order to maintain the

supercriticality of the convection. These are listed in Table 1 as cases s100a, s80a, and
s60a. In these simulations, ν = κ ∝ Ω−2/3
, where the normalization is chosen such that
ν = κ = 2.4 × 1014 cm2 s−1 when Ω0 = 120Ω(cid:12). Thus, this a series of simulations also
has Pr = 1 and follows a parameter path that includes s120. Recall that the convective

0

velocity is artiﬁcially enhanced so the Reynolds numbers are higher than might otherwise

be expected with this value of ν. If we use the (polar) depth of the convection zone as a

length scale and the rms value of the convective velocity as a velocity scale, the Reynolds

numbers in our simulations are on the order of 10-30, making them relatively laminar.

Other quantities listed in Table 1 include the volume-averaged kinetic energy density

relative to the rotating reference frame, KE, as well as the contributions to KE from the

convection (CKE), diﬀerential rotation (DRKE), and meridional circulation (MCKE).

These quantities are deﬁned as follows:

where V denotes the volume of the computational domain and angular brackets denote

The thermal diﬀusion time τd ∼ d2/κ is roughly 15 days, the convective turnover
time scale is roughly 1.2 days, and the rotation period ranges from 0.23-0.47 days. All

simulations have been run for at least 48 days so this spans at least three diﬀusion times,

at least 40 turnover times, and at least 100 rotation periods. All appear to be equilibrated

(see Figs. 6 and 7 below).

One more comment is in order before proceeding to the main results. When

interpreting the KE data in Table 1 and below, it is important to realize that the oblate

shells have more mass and volume than their spherical counterparts. This is a consequence

of our initialization approach discussed in section 2.3. In particular, the density on

the inner equipotential surface, ρi is the same for all simulations. However, the oblate

geometries have a greater volume, which gives rise to a larger mass. The mass of the

convective envelope Mc for each simulation is listed in Table 1 relative to the central mass

M. The most extreme case, o120, has about 37% more mass in the convection zone than

s120. This is somewhat less than the volume diﬀerence, which is about 51% greater in

case o120 than in s120 (Table 1). Thus, although the volume-averaged KE density listed

in Table 1 is slightly smaller in case o120 compared to s120, the total kinetic energy

– 25 –

integrated over the entire volume (in ergs) is larger by about 36%, comparable to the

diﬀerence in mass. In other words, the mean kinetic energy per unit mass (KE multiplied

by V and divided by Mc) is almost the same in cases o120 and s120 (within 1%). This is a

measure of the density-weighted velocity amplitude. The other oblate cases have slightly

higher kinetic energy per unit mass than their spherial counterparts, ranging from 3%

higher in o60 to 6% higher in o70, o100, and o110 to 11% and 15% higher in cases o90

and o80. The downward trend in this ratio for Ω0 > 80Ω(cid:12) may be due to a saturation of

DRKE/KE in the fastest-rotating oblate stars (see Section 4.1). Note also that Mc/M << 1

in all cases (Table 1), justifying our assumption in section 2.3 that the bulk of the mass

lies inside the inner radius.

4. OVERVIEW OF CONVECTIVE STRUCTURE

4.1. Energetics

The evolution of the kinetic energy for the o and s series of simulations is illustrated

in Figure 6. All of these simulations start from the polytropic, adiabatic stratiﬁcation

described in Section 2.3. Therefore, the initial entropy gradient is zero for all cases. With

the heating due to the radiative heat ﬂux at the bottom and the constant temperature at

the top, the entropy gradient becomes superadiabatic. Once the negative entropy gradient

is built up and the Rayleigh number Ra exceeds a critical value, the ﬂow locks on to the

fastest-growing eigenmode which then grows exponentially.

However, even before this exponential growth phase, there is a slow initial algebraic

growth in the KE in response to the radiative heating. We have veriﬁed that this growth

does not occur when the luminosity is set to zero so it is not due to numerical errors, such

as those associated with the conservation of angular momentum or hydrostatic balance,

which can pose problems on unstructured grids. We ﬁnd our spectral diﬀerence method

and grid generation procedure described in Section 2 to be very eﬀective at minimizing

these numerical errors, limiting the relative error in the KE to about one part in 107. The

structure of the ﬂow in this initial establishement period suggests that it is indeed weak

convective motions that are induced by the heating.

The duration of this initial establishment period before the exponential growth

phase varies with the rotation rate and oblateness. As the rotation rate is increased, this

duration increases from 6 days for case s60 to 12 days for case s120 (Figure 6a). This

can be attributed to the stabilizing inﬂuence of rotation, which requires a greater entropy

– 29 –

gradient to trigger convection. A similar eﬀect is also observed in the oblate spheroidal

shell simulations shown in Figure 6b. In order to assess the eﬀect of oblateness on the

growth and saturation of the convection, four cases are compared in Figure 7. The initial

establishment period in case o60 is only a little longer than that in case s60, which is

expected because the oblateness in case o60 is minimal as shown in Table 1. In contrast,

the diﬀerence between cases s120 and o120 is pronounced (about 13 days), implying that

the signiﬁcant oblateness in case o120 has a substantial inﬂuence on the establishment

of a supercritical entropy gradient. This can be attributed to the greater depth of the

convection zone at the equator for the oblate cases, which dilutes the ﬂux convergence

and weakens thermal gradients.

cases in oblate spheroidal shells.

It is clear from Figure 6 and Table 1 that the more rapidly-rotating cases saturate at

a lower level of KE than the more slowly-rotating cases. This is a consequence of the

stabilizing eﬀects of rotation and rotational shear (diﬀerential rotation) and it occurs in

both the spherical and oblate cases. However, the stabilizing inﬂuence on KE is somewhat

larger in the oblate cases. For example, the KE in o120 is about 36% of that in o60

whereas the ratio between s120 and s60 is 41%. However, recall that KE is the mean

kinetic energy density. If the diﬀerence in volume is taken into account, then the total

kinetic energy in case o120 is about 51% of the total kinetic energy in o60. We also

note that the decrease in total KE with increasing Ω0 is a result that is sensitive to our

chosen path through parameter space, which is to keep ν and κ constant. Recall from

Section 3 that we decrease ν and κ as we increase Ω0 in the a series of simulations (s60a,

s80a, s100a, and s120) in order to maintain a relatively constant supercriticality. In these

simulations, the total KE decreases only slightly from s60a to s100a and is in fact largest

for s120, due largely to a strong diﬀerential rotation (Table 1).

For both the spherical and the oblate cases, more of the KE is contained in the

diﬀerential rotation as Ω0 is increased (Table 1). This is a common feature of global

convection simulations and is attributed to the enhancement of the convective Reynolds

stress (e.g. Brown et al. 2008). In the spherical cases, the ratio of DRKE/KE increases

steadily over the entire range in rotation rates, from 60 to 120 Ω(cid:12). However, interestingly,
the DRKE/KE ratio seems to saturate in the oblate cases at about 0.61 for Ω0 (cid:38) 80Ω(cid:12). In
this range of rotation rates, the DRKE/KE ratio is less than in the corresponding spherical

cases, indicating that pronounced oblateness tends to suppress diﬀerential rotation. This

result may or may not be related to the observed saturation of the diﬀerential rotation

∆Ω in rapidly-rotating stars, which will be discussed in section 4.3. For more moderate

rotation rates, Ω0 < 80Ω(cid:12), the oblate cases tend to have a slightly higher ratio of

DRKE/KE compared to their spherical counterparts.

In contrast to DRKE/KE, the MCKE/KE ratio decreases as Ω0 is increased. This

– 32 –

again is commonly seen in spherical convection simulations and is attributed to the

nature of the Reynolds stress and the tendency for ﬂows to align with the rotation axis as

expressed by the Taylor-Proudman theorem (Brown et al. 2008). In short, the meridional

circulation is established in response to the convective angular momentum ﬂux in a

process known as gyroscopic pumping (Miesch & Hindman 2011; Featherstone & Miesch

2015). As the rotational inﬂuence is increased, this ﬂux becomes perpendicular to the z

axis and is less eﬀective at inducing a meridional circulation. Though both the spherical

and oblate cases exhibit a decrease in the MCKE/KE ratio as Ω0 is increased, the eﬀect

is somewhat more pronounced in the oblate cases. Furthermore, the MCKE/KE ratio is

generally less in the oblate cases than in the spherical cases with the same rotation rate.

In other words, the oblateness tends to suppress the MC, at least in terms of its kinetic

energy. This is somewhat of a surprise; one might have expected the oblateness to induce

strong baroclinic circulations but we see no evidence of this. We will return to these

issues in section 4.3.

4.2. Convective Patterns

In Figure 8, the structure of the convection is illustrated. Shown is the velocity
normal to equipotential surfaces un = u·n, in Mollweide projection for a horizontal
surface in the upper convection zone. All simulations are dominated by a series of

columnar convective rolls approximately aligned with the rotation axis but sheared

slightly in the prograde direction at low latitudes by the diﬀerential rotation. These are

the well-known ’banana cells’ characteristics of convection in rotating shells for laminar

parameter regimes (Miesch 2005). There is little apparent diﬀerence between simulations

– 33 –

in spherical shells and those in oblate spheroidal shells. In particular, the azimuthal
wavenumber of the banana cell pattern is similar, on the order of m ∼ 22 for both s120
and o120.

This qualitative similarity in appearance is conﬁrmed by the quantitative power

spectra, which are compared in Figure 9. Each curve represents the power spectrum

obtained by applying a spherical harmonic transformation to the normal velocity ﬁelds

shown in Figure 8 and then plotting the resulting power as a function of the spherical

harmonic degree, which is, in eﬀect, the horizontal wavenumber. The diﬀerences between

the spherical and oblate cases are insigniﬁcant.

However, closer scrutiny of Figure 8 does reveal some notable diﬀerences,

particularly in the polar regions. It is well known that convection in rotating spherical

shells can be divided into two distinct dynamical regions, delineated by the so-called

tangent cylinder (Miesch 2005). The tangent cylinder is a 2D cylindrical surface with

a central axis aligned with the rotation axis and a cylindrical radius that is equal to the

radius of the base of the convection zone at the equator. Outside the tangent cylinder, the

convection is generally dominated by banana cells or related vortex sheets. These are the

equatorial modes. Meanwhile, the polar convection modes inside the tangent cylinder

tend to be more horizontally isotropic, particularly at moderate Rossby numbers and high

Rayleigh numbers.

Though all simulations exhibit a clear diﬀerence between polar and equatorial

modes, the diﬀerence is much more pronounced in the fastest-rotating oblate cases. This

can be seen most clearly by comparing cases s120 and o120 in Figure 8a and b. In case

s120, the polar modes are highly anisotropic and linked with the equatorial banana modes.

.

By contrast, in case o120, the polar modes clearly decouple from the equatorial modes

and exhibit a more isotropic cellular structure (see also Figs. 10 and 11 below). The same

eﬀect can also be seen in cases s90 and o90 (Figure 8c, d).

The diﬀerence in the structure of the polar convection modes in cases s120 and o120

is further illustrated in Figure 10. Here it can be seen that the polar convection in case

o120 is not only more isotropic and more decoupled from lower latitudes, but it is also

more vigorous. We will return to this issue in Section 5.1. We close this section with an

orthographic view of case o120 from a point closer to the equatorial plane, highlighting

its oblateness.

4.3. Diﬀerential Rotation

Diﬀerential rotation established by convection is a common feature in stars. The

latitudinal angular velocity contrast on the surface, ∆Ω, is an important quantity both

for interpreting stellar observations and for dynamo theories. Various observational

techniques have been employed to measure ∆Ω, and to investigate the relationship

between ∆Ω and the stellar angular velocity Ω0. These observational techniques range

from photometric variability studies (Donahue et al. 1996) to Doppler imaging techniques

– 37 –

Fig. 11.— As in Figure 10b but viewed closer to the equatorial plane.

(Donati et al. 2003) and Fourier transform methods (Reiners & Schmitt 2003). Global

numerical simulations and mean-ﬁeld models of convection in spherical shells have

also been used to study that relationship (Brown et al. 2008; Hotta & Yokoyama 2011).

Speciﬁcally, ∆Ω is often deﬁned as the diﬀerence in angular velocity between the equator
and 60◦ latitude, namely,

∆Ω = Ωeq − Ω60.

(22)

The diﬀerential rotation proﬁles for all of the simulations considered in this paper

are solar-like in the sense that the equator rotates more rapidly than the polar regions

– 38 –

a series of simulations s60a-s100a, marked with blue squares. These latter simulations

(shown with blue squares) follow a power law, with a best-ﬁt exponent of n = 0.89.

(∆Ω > 0). Detailed rotation proﬁles will be discussed in Section 6. Here we focus on the

dependence of ∆Ω (computed using eq. 33 below) on Ω0, which is shown in Figure 12.

For the spherical simulations s60-s120, ∆Ω is insensitive to Ω0, showing no clear

trend. This is somewhat of a surprise, since previous studies of convection in rotating

spherical shells exhibit an increase of ∆Ω with Ω0 (e.g. Brown et al. 2008). However,

recall from Section 3 that in this series of simulations ν and κ were kept constant as Ω0
was increased. By contrast, Brown et al. (2008) decreased ν and κ (∝ Ω−2/3

to maintain a relatively constant supercriticality. This is the motivation behind our a

series of simulations, represented in Figure 12 by the blue boxes. These use the same

scaling for ν and κ as in Brown et al. (2008), and we ﬁnd similar results. In particular,
∆Ω monotonically increases with Ω0 approximately as a power law; ∆Ω ∝ Ωn
n ∼ 0.89. This is qualitatively consistent with the results of Brown et al. (see also Hotta &
Yokoyama 2011), though our exponent is somewhat steeper than their value of n ∼ 0.3,
valid for Rossby numbers below about 0.4.

0 with

These trends are generally consistent with observations, which suggest 0.15 (cid:46) n < 1

for solar-type stars (Donahue et al. 1996; Donati et al. 2003; Reiners & Schmitt 2003).

However, this observed scaling relation only holds out to about 20Ω(cid:12), after which ∆Ω

may remain constant or even decrease with Ω0, though observational evidence for this is

still only preliminary (Saar 2009). This saturation and perhaps reversal of the ∆Ω vs Ω0

scaling relation appears to be associated with a similar saturation of the magnetic ﬁeld
strength, B, which increases with Ω0 until about the same point, Ω0 ∼ 20Ω(cid:12), beyond
which B becomes approximately independent of Ω0 (e.g. Pizzolato et al. 2003). This

suggests that the saturation of the ∆Ω vs Ω0 relationship for rapidly-rotating solar like

stars is likely due to strong Lorentz-force feedbacks associated with vigorous dynamo

action.

However, our simulations suggest that oblateness may also contribute to the

saturation of ∆Ω for very fast rotation rates. We already noted in Section 4.1 that the
DRKE/KE ratio saturates at about 0.61 for Ω0 (cid:38) 80Ω(cid:12). This result is also reﬂected in the
∆Ω plot of Figure 12, which shows a peak value at Ω0 ∼ 90Ω(cid:12), only for the oblate cases.
At more rapid rotation rates, the oblateness seems to supress the diﬀerential rotation.

– 40 –

This is likely due to the decoupling between polar and equatorial modes noted in Section

4.2. If banana cells reach beyond the tangent cylinder and into the polar regions as in

case s120, the associated Reynolds stress can eﬃciently spin down the poles, enhancing

the diﬀerential rotation. However, if the polar and equatorial modes decouple due to

oblateness as in case o120, this can inhibit the angular momentum transport and diminish

∆Ω.

We will explore the mean ﬂows in more detail in Section 6. However, before we

proceed, one more comment is warranted in order to relate our simulations to previous

work. Our numerical approach described in Section 2 neglects the eﬀect of diﬀerential

rotation on oblateness. Is this justiﬁed? MacGregor et al. (2007) showed that diﬀerential

rotation could signiﬁcantly distort the shape of rapidly rotating stars compared to

corresponding cases with uniform rotation. However, in their model the reference rotation

rate Ω0 was allowed to be larger than the critical rotation rate Ωcrit and an anti-solar

diﬀerential rotation proﬁle was introduced to achieve stable solutions. This extreme

situation is likely to be rare in real stars. Furthermore, MacGregor et al. (2007) considered

a full, 2D stellar structure model that included diﬀerential rotation down to the region of

energy generation in the stellar core. Given the sensitivity of energy generation to the

thermal structure, even a slight oblateness of the core could have a substantial inﬂuence

on the stellar luminosity. If the diﬀerential rotation is solar-like in the sense that the

equator spins faster than the pole and if it is conﬁned to the convective envelope, then we

expect the diﬀerential rotation to have a negligible inﬂuence on the oblateness. This is

demonstrated in Appendix A.

5. CONVECTIVE ENERGY TRANSPORT

5.1. Flux Balance and Entropy Stratiﬁcation

From a star’s perspective, perhaps the most important function of convection is

energy transport; it carries the energy liberated by fusion in the core to the surface,

where that energy is then radiated into space. Since this paper is the ﬁrst to consider 3D

simulations of convection in oblate stars, we believe that it is useful to consider the issue

of outward energy transport with some care.

We begin by integrating Equation (3) over a volume VS that is bounded on the bottom

by the lower boundary of the computational domain, deﬁned by Φ = Φi, and on the top

by an arbirtary geopotential within the computational domain, Φ = ΦS. This yields

ρu·∇ΦdV .

In deriving equation (23) we have used Stokes’ theorem to express the volume integral of

the ﬂux divergences as a surface integral and we have expressed the eﬀective gravity as

the gradient of the Roche potential, eq. (5). The area A in the surface integral includes
both the inner boundary at Φ = Φi, which we call surface Si, and the upper boundary of
Vs at Φ = ΦS, which we call surface S.

We proceed by assuming that the ﬂow is in a statistically steady state. This implies

that the time derivative on the left-hand-side of eq. (23) can be neglected. Together

with equation (1), it also implies that the mass ﬂux is approximately divergence-free,
∇·(ρu) = 0. The divergence-free nature of the mass ﬂux also follows from the low Mach
number and nearly adiabatic, hydrostatic background stratiﬁcation, which forms the basis

for the anelastic approximation (e.g. Jones et al. 2011). This allows us to write the last

term in eq. (23) as

Thus, the buoyant and centrifugal acceleration do not change the total energy contained

Note also that, since u = 0 on surface Si, the only contribution to the integrated ﬂux

on that surface is from the diﬀusive ﬂuxes f. Equation (15) then implies

(32)

In summary, four principle components of the energy ﬂux are involved in transporting

energy in the outward direction, namely the enthalpy ﬂux Fe, the kinetic energy ﬂux Fk,

the radiative ﬂux Fr and the diﬀusive entropy ﬂux Fu. In a statistically steady state, these

four ﬂuxes together must account for the full luminosity imposed at the bottom boundary.

– 44 –

For a spherical shell AS = 4πr2 but this is no longer true for an oblate shell where we

compute AS numerically.

Figure 13 shows the ﬂux balance through equipotential surfaces for cases s60 and

o60. It is apparent that the energy ﬂux distribution in case s60 is very similar to that in

case o60, which is expected because of the small oblateness. By design, the radiative ﬂux

Fr carries all of the imposed ﬂux at the bottom where the normal velocity vanishes, as do

Fk and Fe. The radiative ﬂux Fr also dominates the heat transport in the lower convective

envelope while the entropy ﬂux Fu carries energy through the top boundary and the upper

convective envelope. The strong correlations between normal velocities and temperature

ﬂuctuations yield the enthalpy ﬂux Fe, which gradually increases towards the top from

the bottom until it peaks near Φ/Φo = 0.93. It then drops down to zero rapidly as it

approaches the impenetrable top boundary.

As seen in Figure 14, the diﬀerence in the energy ﬂux distribution between cases

s120 and o120 is more signiﬁcant. This is especially true for the enthalpy ﬂux Fe and the
entropy ﬂux Fu. In case s120, Fe reaches a maximum value of 0.32 around Φ/Φrop
while the peak Fe value in case o120 is only 0.25, achieved around Φ/Φo = 0.97. This

= 0.95

suggests that the oblateness is slightly inhibiting the net convective energy transport

through the shell. The normalized sum of the four principle ﬂux components in all of our

simulations is close to one throughout the shell, signifying that they have achieved an

equilibrated state.

It is well known that rapid rotation also tends to inhibit convection (Miesch 2005).

This can be seen in our simulations through its eﬀect on the mean entropy stratiﬁcation.

We ﬁnd that the convection is less able to establish an adiabatic proﬁle throughout the

convection zone in the rapidly rotating simulations. Instead, much of the convection zone
remains slightly superadiabatic (∇S·n < 0). The radial proﬁle of the normal entropy
gradient ∇S·n for our simulations is shown in Figure 15, highlighting the dependence on
the rotation rate. For the spherical simulations (Fig. 15a), the normal entropy gradient

exhibits a greater departure from the adiabatic proﬁle as the rotation rate is increased

from 60Ω0 to 120Ω0. This signiﬁes a decrease in the eﬃciency of the convective energy

transport for two reasons. First, the convection is less able to mix entropy to establish an

adiabatic stratiﬁcation. Second, the reduced enthalpy ﬂux (Fe) in the upper convection

zone requires a steeper entropy gradient (larger Fu) in order to satisfy the ﬂux balance

equation (32).

A similar trend is observed in the upper convection zone for the oblate simulations

(Fig. 15b). Here again, the magnitude of the superadiabatic entropy gradient increases

with increasing Ω0. However, this trend reverses near the outer boundary as highlighted

in the inset. This can be attributed to the larger surface area of the oblate spheroids. In

order for each simulation to achieve equilibrium, the total ﬂux through the outer boundary

must equal the total ﬂux imposed through the inner boundary, which is in turn equal to

the luminosity, L. In our simulations, the ﬂux through the outer boundary is carried by

the entropy ﬂux Fu, which is proportional to the normal entropy gradient, as expressed in

equation (31). Thus in order to achieve equilibrium, Fu must be equal to L/Ao at Φ = Φo,

where Ao is the area of the outer surface. Thus, for a given L, the Fu is reduced as Ao is

increased. In other words, the total luminosity is spread over a larger area in oblate stars

so the ﬂux through any ﬁxed area on the surface is reduced.

In order to further investigate the eﬀect of oblateness on the entropy stratiﬁcation,

– 47 –

we compare four cases in Figure 16. As expected, there is little diﬀerence between cases

s60 and o60 since the oblateness is small (see Table 1). However, the normal entropy

gradient in case o120 is signiﬁcantly smaller in magnitude than in case s120. Several

factors contribute to this result. One is the larger surface area, which dilutes Fu in the

upper convection zone as noted in the previous paragraph. Another is the somewhat less

eﬃcient convective transport, as noted above in the discussion of Figure 14. Yet another

is the larger depth of the convection zone, which tends to weaken thermal gradients in
general. For example, consider the normal entropy ﬂux at the equator where n is parallel
to the radial direction. There ∇S·n = ∂S /∂r = CP
the pressure and density scale heights. The weaker eﬀective gravity due to the centrifugal

, where HP and Hρ are

force tends to increase both HP and Hρ, which decreases ∂S /∂r. Viewed another way, a

given entropy diﬀerence ∆S is stretched out over a wider radial distance at low latitudes

in an oblate star because of the relatively large spacing between the potential surfaces.

5.2. Emergent Flux and Gravity Darkening

As mentioned in Section 1, one of the major theoretical results associated with

rapidly-rotating, oblate stars is the concept of gravity darkening. This was originally

predicted by von Zeipel (1924) for the particular case of massive stars with radiative
envelopes. In this case the surface ﬂux is dominated by the radiative ﬂux Fr ∝ ∇T. Since
T is constant on equipotential surfaces, T = T(Φ) (see §2.3 for the case of adiabatic
stratiﬁcation), then Fr ∝ ∇T = (dT/dΦ)∇Φ ∝ ge f f , where ge f f is the eﬀective gravity
(see Section 1). Since ge f f is reduced at the equator, the Von Zeipel model predicts that

the equatorial regions should possess less energy ﬂux than the polar regions and should

therefore appear darker. As mentioned in §1, this qualitative prediction has indeed been

veriﬁed for massive stars, though the contrast between equator and pole is less than

predicted (van Belle et al. 2001; Domiciano de Souza et al. 2005; McAlister et al. 2005;

Monnier et al. 2007; Zhao et al. 2009; van Belle 2012).

However, the Van Zeipel model does not apply to late-type stars with convective

envelopes. In these stars, the surface ﬂux is not dominated by Fr so the line of reasoning

that gives rise to gravity darkening should be regarded as questionable. Several attempts

have been made to extend the Von Zeipel model to late-type stars but they all involve

drastic assumptions about the nature of the convective heat transport. Lucy (1967) used

mixing-length models of convection to predict a result that resembles gravity darkening
but with a weaker latitudinal dependence, such that the emergent ﬂux is ∝ g0.32

these mixing-length models are local in nature and do not take into account coherent

structures such as banana cells that are known to dominate convective heat transport

in global simulations of convection in rotating spherical (or spheriodal) geometries.

Espinosa Lara & Rieutord (2011) also presented a model that in principle should apply

to convective envelopes as well as radiative envelopes. However, this model assumes

that the convective heat ﬂux is directed normal to Φ surfaces, which may or may not be

true. Global convection simulations often exhibit a signiﬁcant latitudinal heat ﬂux that

can have a substantial inﬂuence on the ﬂux that eventually emerges through the outer

boundary (e.g. Miesch 2005).

In this paper, we are the ﬁrst to address the issue of gravity darkening from the

perspective of global, 3D simulations of convection.

As noted in Section 5.1, the convective enthalpy ﬂux Fe in our simulations peaks in

the upper convection zone (see Fig. 14). Both warm upﬂows and cool downﬂows serve

to transport ﬂux out of the star. However, this enthalpy ﬂux is not uniform in latitude, as

demonstrated in Figure 17 which shows the zonally-averaged Fe in cases s120 and o120.

This shows eﬃcient heat transport through the convective envelope near the equatorial

region in both cases. This is attributed to the banana cells that arise because of the

inﬂuence of rotation on convection. The alignment of convective banana cells with the

rotation axis allows for more eﬃcient heat transport.

We also ﬁnd that more enthalpy ﬂux ﬂows through the polar regions in case o120

than in case s120. This diﬀerence arises because of the thinner depth of the convection

zone at high latitudes, which tends to increase the radial temperature and entropy gradient

as discussed in Section 5.1. This in turn increases the buoyant driving, making the

– 51 –

convection more vigorous. The greater vigor of polar convection in case o120 is likely

also associated with the decoupling of the polar and equatorial convection modes as

discussed in Section 4.2. The prominent vertical striping of the polar enthalpy ﬂux

apparent in Figure 17b is associated with strong mean ﬂows as discussed in Section 6.

(a)

(b)

Fig. 17.— Shown are snapshots of the enthalpy ﬂux Fe in cases (a) s120 and (b) o120,

averaged over longitude.

The enthalpy ﬂux is within the star but only the heat ﬂux coming out at the surface

can be observed. In our model, the heat ﬂux passing through the outer surface of the star

is carried by the diﬀusive entropy ﬂux, Fu. Thus, this is the quantity to consider in order

to assess the latitudinal dependence of the emergent ﬂux, within the context of gravity

darkening. Figure 18 shows the comparison of latitudinal entropy ﬂux Fu at the outer

surface simulated in cases s120 and o120. For comparison, we have also plotted the

proﬁles predicted by von Zeipel (1924) and Espinosa Lara & Rieutord (2011) in Figure

18.

There are two noteworthy results to be gleaned from Figure 18. First, a comparison

between cases s120 and o120 clearly shows an enhanced polar heat ﬂux in the latter case.

The oblateness will tend to make the poles brighter, as in the standard gravity darkening

paradigm (von Zeipel 1924; Espinosa Lara & Rieutord 2011). However, in stark contrast

to the standard paradigm, case o120 exhibits a secondary peak in the emergent heat ﬂux

at the equator. This is the second noteworthy result and, unlike the ﬁrst, is somewhat

unexpected.

Though the emergent ﬂux is carried by Fu, both of these results can be ultimately

attributed to the nature of the deeper enthalpy ﬂux Fe illustrated in Figure 17. Since Fe

must vanish at the surface due to the impenetrable boundary condition, there must be a

convergence of the outward enthalpy ﬂux just below the surface, which preferentially

heats the ﬂuid in the polar and equatorial regions. Since the temperature is ﬁxed at the

outer surface, this heating increases the normal temperature and entropy gradients. In

other words, the enhanced enthalpy ﬂux Fe in the polar and equatorial regions is converted

into an emergent diﬀusive entropy ﬂux Fu.

Heat transport by global convective motions under the inﬂuence of rotation and

stratiﬁcation is not taken into account in the analysis of von Zeipel (1924) and Espinosa

Lara & Rieutord (2011). Only global, 3D convection simulations can explicitly capture

these eﬀects. Ours are the ﬁrst such simulations and they are calling into question

common assumptions. For example, since the imposed heat ﬂux on the bottom boundary

is uniform, a non-uniform heat ﬂux across any equipotential surface Φ necessarily implies

– 53 –

a nonzero heat ﬂux along Φ surfaces somewhere deeper in the convection zone, provided

that the simulation is equilibrated. This violates the assumptions made by both von Zeipel

(1924) and Espinosa Lara & Rieutord (2011).

Our results imply that rapidly-rotating, oblate, lower-mass stars with convective

envelopes might not have darker equators after all. However, there is a caveat to this

conclusion that has to do with the parameter regimes that we have considered in our

simulations. It is well known that banana cells are the linearly preferred instability modes

for convection in rapidly-rotating spherical shells (Miesch 2005). Thus, as the Rayleigh

number Ra is increased beyond the critical value for convection to set in, the equatorial

modes are excited ﬁrst, causing the convective enthalpy ﬂux to peak at the equator. As Ra

is increased further, the polar modes are excited. Thus, the energy ﬂux proﬁles for cases

s120 and o120 shown in Figures 17 and 18, featuring prominent minima at mid latitudes,

are commonly seen in global convection simulatons at moderate Rayleigh numbers. At

the much higher Rayleigh numbers characteristic of real stars, these minima may ﬁll

in at least partially, making the emergent heat ﬂux more uniform. Thus, we may be

overestimating the magnitude of the latitudinal variation. Still, the enhanced brightness

at the poles and equator are real physical eﬀects, grounded in the physics of rotating

convection. These are the regions where convective structures can align with the rotation

axis, enhancing the eﬃciency of the convective energy transport.

models of oblate stars. Here we look at the mean ﬂows (diﬀerential rotation and

meridional circulation) in more detail, considering the inﬂuence of oblateness on their

spatial structure.

We deﬁne mean ﬂows as averages of the velocity ﬁeld u or the mass ﬂux ρu

over longitude. Longitudinal averages are denoted by angular brackets, e.g. (cid:104)uφ(cid:105). The
diﬀerential rotation (in nHz) is expressed in terms of the angular velocity as follows:

We deﬁne thermal variations S (cid:48) and T (cid:48) by averaging over longitude and time and then
subtracting the spherically-symmetric component in order to highlight variations relative

to the mean stratiﬁcation. The mean ﬂows for cases o120 and cases s120 are shown in

Figure 19.

As mentioned in Section 4.3, the simulations considered here all have a solar-like

diﬀerential rotation proﬁle, with relatively fast rotation at the equator that decreases

toward higher latitudes (Fig. 19d,h). This is a common feature of convection simulations

at low Rossby number and is established by the convective angular momentum transport

associated with banana cells (e.g. Miesch 2005; Brown et al. 2008). These rotation

proﬁles are generally in thermal wind balance, maintained in part by baroclinic torques

that oﬀset the tendency for Ω contours to align with the rotation axis in accordance with

the Taylor-Proudman theorem. It is this thermal wind eﬀect that is responsible for the

poleward gradients that dominate the temperature and entropy proﬁles in Figure 19,

frames b, c, f , and g.

However, superposed on this monotonic decrease of Ω from equator to pole, case

o120 exhibits a striking series of alternating zonal jets in both polar regions (Fig. 19d).

These are associated with a similar series of strong meridional circulation cells that can

be seen prominently in the latitudinal mass ﬂux plot of Figure 19a. Though the zonal

jets are conﬁned to the upper convection zone, the meridional cells extend throughout the

convection zone, with a signiﬁcant poleward tilt from bottom to top. Similar features are

also present in cases o100 and o110 (not shown).

The faint thermal signature in Fig. 19b,c suggests that these are axisymmetric

convection cells, with the zonal jets arising from the Coriolis-induced deﬂection of

meridional ﬂows toward and away from the rotation axis near the outer surface. This

thermal signature is also seen in the enthalpy ﬂux of Figure 17b and in the emergent ﬂux

of Figure 18 (as the high-latitude wiggles). The presence of these convective cells near

the polar regions in case o120 is likely due in part to the larger entropy gradient since

the polar convection zone depth is relatively small compared to the equatorial depth (see

Section 5.1). In any case, they appear to be induced by the oblateness.

At lower latitudes, outside the tangent cylinder, the meridional ﬂow in both cases

s120 and o120 exhibits a multiple-cell structure characterized by alternating regions of

northward and southward mass ﬂux (Fig. 19a,e). This too is a common feature in global

convection simulations and is attributed to the nature of the convective Reynolds stress

induced by banana cells (Featherstone & Miesch 2015).

To study the temporal evolution of the high-latitude zonal jets in case o120, we have

plotted in Figure 20 a latitude-time map of Ω in the vicinity of the north pole (latitudes
≥ 50◦). Recall that the rotation period in this case is about 0.23 days (a factor of 120 less
than the Sun), so the time period covered in the plot spans over 100 rotation periods (and

over 20 convective turnover times). Some of the zonal jets persist for this entire interval,

– 58 –

though they meander in latitude. Each jet is about 4-5◦ wide.

7. Summary

We have preformed the ﬁrst global 3D hydrodynamic simulations of convection in

the oblate envelopes of rapidly-rotating solar-type stars using the recently introduced

compressible high-order unstructured spectral diﬀerence (CHORUS) code (WLM15).

The CHORUS code employs unstructured grids, giving it the capability to deal with

oblate spheroidal shell geometries. This unique tool allows us to investigate the inﬂuence

of the oblateness on the convection and mean ﬂows, including heat transport, diﬀerential

rotation, and the thermal structure of the convective envelope.

– 59 –

We have found that the inﬂuence of rotation and oblateness leads to an enhancement

of the emerging heat ﬂux in the polar and equatorial regions. This is in stark contrast to the

conventional concept of gravity darkening and has important observational implications;

oblate, low-mass stars with convective envelopes may not exhibit gravity darkening in the

same way that higher-mass stars do. In particular, the minimum suface brightness might

occur at mid-latitudes rather than at the equator.

The enhancement of the polar heat ﬂux due to oblateness arises for essentially the

same reason as in classical gravity darkening arguments; the stronger eﬀective gravity

relative to lower latitudes enhances thermal gradients (see Section 5.1). This makes the

convection more vigorous. However, the secondary peak in the emergent heat ﬂux at the

equator arises from physical eﬀects that are not taken into account in the classical models

of von Zeipel (1924), Lucy (1967), and Espinosa Lara & Rieutord (2011). Oblate stars

are rapidly-rotating by nature, implying strong rotational constraints on the convective

motions (low Rossby numbers). In these parameter regimes, the convection in the

equatorial region (outside the tangent cylinder) is dominated by banana cells, columnar

convective modes aligned with the rotation axis. These banana cells can transport heat

more eﬃciently than at mid-latitudes.

In short, the convective heat transport peaks at the poles and at the equator because

this is where the convective structures can most easily organize themselves to mitigate

the strong rotational constraints: vertical plumes at high latitudes and banana cells at low

latitudes. Furthermore, though banana cells are essentially laminar ﬂow features, this

fundamental argument also extends to more turbulent parameter regimes (higher Rayleigh

and Reynolds numbers). For example, in the high-resolution Boussinesq simulations

– 60 –

of Kageyama et al. (2008), the convective columns break up into vortex sheets as the

diﬀusion is decreased. However, these vortex sheets are still aligned with the rotation axis

outside the tangent cylinder and would still be expected to yield an enhancement of the

equatorial heat ﬂux.

Thus, we expect that the general latitudinal dependence of the emergent heat ﬂux

in oblate solar-type stars to be similar to that found here, with maxima at the poles and

equator. However, as discussed in Section 5.2, we may be overestimating the magnitude

of the variation, which here is on the order of 40% (see Figure 18).

The latitudinal dependence of the emergent heat ﬂux is a symptom of the more

general tendency for convection in rapidly-rotating spherical or spheroidal shells to

separate into distinct polar and equatorial modes, inside and outside the tangent cylinder.

We ﬁnd that the oblateness enhances this dichotomy, causing the polar regions to

largely decouple from the equatorial regions (Figs. 8, 10). However, other aspects of

the convective structure such as the power spectrum and the width of banana cells, are

insensitive to the oblateness.

Another notable result from our simulations is the presence of banded zonal jets at

high latitudes (Section 6). Remarkably, these only occur in the oblate simulations, so they

are clearly induced by the oblateness. They appear to be due to narrow, axisymmetric

convective modes that are approximately aligned with the rotation axis but signiﬁcantly
tilted (Fig. 19). Each jet is about 4-5◦ wide and many persist for over 100 rotation periods,
though they meander in latitude (Figure 20).

It is unclear whether or not these jets would persist in the presence of magnetic ﬁelds.

All stars are ionized and, given the extreme parameter regimes, all stellar convection

– 61 –

zones are expected to undergo vigorous dynamo action. Dynamo-generated magnetic

ﬁelds might suppress the polar jets directly by means of magnetic tension or indirectly

by inhibiting the intrinsic self-organization processes of rapidly-rotating hydrodynamic

turbulence (e.g. the inverse cascade of kinetic energy and the anisotropic suppression of

this cascade that gives rise to the Rhines scale). However, these jets do not appear to

arise from the inverse cascade of smaller-scale vorticies. Whether or not they occur in the

presence of magnetism is a topic for future work. Though CHORUS does not currently

have the capability to solve the full set of MHD equations, we intend to implement this

capability in the future.

The amplitude of the diﬀerential rotation is not very sensitive to either the rotation

rate or the oblateness. If we decrease ν and κ as we increase the rotation rate in order

to mainin a roughly constant supercriticality, we ﬁnd that the diﬀerential rotation scales
as ∆Ω ∝ Ω0.89
consistent with previous global convection simulations and stellar observations (Section

. This result is for spherical (non-oblate) simulations and is qualitatively

0

4.3). Alternatively, if ν and κ are held constant, we ﬁnd no clear scaling of ∆Ω versus Ω0

(Fig. 12). However, the fraction of the total kinetic energy contained in the diﬀerential

rotation, DRKE/KE, does increase monotonically in these same spherical simulations as

Ω0 is increased from 0.526 in case s60 to 0.681 to case s120 (Table 1).

It is interesting that the oblateness tends to suppress this increase of DRKE/KE with

Ω0. For the oblate series of simulations, o60 through o120, the DRKE/KE ratio saturates
at a maximum value of 0.61 for Ω0 (cid:38) 80Ω(cid:12) (Table 1). This trend is also visible in the
surface diﬀerential rotation ∆Ω, which decreases slightly beyond about 90Ω(cid:12) (Fig. 12).

The fractional diﬀerential rotation ∆Ω/Ω0 decreases with increasing rotation for both the

– 62 –

spherical and the oblate stars. Furthermore, we argue that the diﬀerential rotation is likely

to be too weak to have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the oblateness (Appendix A).

We acknowledge that our simulations certainly have their limitations, the most

important being the relatively laminar parameter regimes and the absence of magnetic

ﬁelds. However, as the ﬁrst simulations of their kind, we regard these as a baseline for

future work. We have identiﬁed interesting features that warrant further study, such as

a departure from the classical gravity darkening paradigm for late-type stars and the

presence of polar jets induced by oblateness. And, we have demonstrated some of the

potential of the new CHORUS code, which promises to be a unique and powerful tool for

the ongoing investigation of stellar and planetary convection.

A. EFFECT OF DIFFERENTIAL ROTATION ON OBLATENESS

A fully self-consistent simulation would properly capture the nonlinear interaction

between the convection, the diﬀerential rotation, and the oblateness, allowing the star to

deform in response to the diﬀerential rotation that the convection establishes. However,

this poses signiﬁcant computational challenges and we show in this Appendix that even if

we were to overcome these challenges, it would be unlikely to change our results.

In this appendix we investigate the eﬀect of diﬀerential rotation on the oblateness

of rotating stars in a simple model. In this model, the desired oblate spheroidal shell

is obtained by deforming a spherical shell with the uniformly rotating rate Ω0 while

the mass and angular momentum in the z direction is kept unchanged. We neglect

convection and meridional circulation in our analysis; the only motion is the diﬀerential

rotation. Furthermore, to make the problem more analytically tractable, we assume that

the diﬀerential rotation follows a conservative rotation law, Ω = Ω(λ) where λ = r sin θ

is the cylindrical radius, so the centrifugal force can be represented as the gradient of a

potential.

The rotation proﬁle in the oblate spheroidal shell is assumed to be a linear function

of λ;

Ω = Ωa + δ( λ
Ro

)Ω0

(A1)

where Ro is the outer radius of the original spherical shell, δ is the fractional diﬀerential

rotation and Ωa is a coeﬃcient that is adjusted to conserve angular momentum as

described below.

We then compute the structure of the oblate spheroidal shell as described in Section 2,

using this potential instead of equation (5).

During the deformation from the spherical shell to the oblate spheroidal shell with

the desired linear rotation proﬁle, the mass within the domain is kept unchanged,

(A4)

Note that the density proﬁle is as described in Section 2.3 and the integrals (A3) and (A4)

are computed numerically, on a grid as described in Section 2.5. By solving Equations

(A3) and (A4), Ωa is obtained if δ is speciﬁed.

We vary the amplitude of the diﬀerential rotation by varying δ and, for each value

of δ, we compute the oblateness. The results of this analysis are listed in Table 1 for
Ω0 = 120Ω(cid:12) = 3.12 × 10−4 rad s−1. In all cases Ωa < Ω0 because the shell is required to
have the same mass and angular momentum as a spherical shell with the same rotation

rate. For example, for no diﬀerential rotation (δ = 0), the larger moment of inertia
associated with the oblate shell requires Ωa = 2.736 × 10−4 rad s−1 = 105 Ω(cid:12) to achieve

– 65 –

the same angular momentum as a spherical shell rotating at a rate of Ω0 = 120Ω(cid:12). For

δ > 0, Ω varies from Ωa at the rotation axis (λ = 0) to Ωa + δ(O + 1)Ω0 at the equator

(λ = (O + 1)Ro). Averaging the minimum and maximum values of Ω then gives us a

ﬁducial rotation rate of Ω f = Ωa + δ(O + 1)Ω0/2.

The fractional diﬀerential rotation can then be deﬁned as ∆Ω/Ω f ∼ δ(O + 1)Ω0/Ω f .
For δ = 0.36 this gives a fractional diﬀerential rotation of 0.5. Thus, according to Table 2,

varying the fractional diﬀerential rotation from 0 (δ = 0) to 0.5 (δ = 0.36) only changes

the oblateness by about 0.22%.

This can be compared with the fractional diﬀerential rotation ∆Ω/Ω0 achieved in

our simulations, as shown in Figure 12. As shown there, all cases have a ∆Ω of less than
16 × 10−6 rad s−1. This corresponds to fractional diﬀerential rotation of about 0.10 for
Ω0 = 60Ω(cid:12) and a fractional diﬀerential rotation of about 0.05 for Ω0 = 120Ω(cid:12). Thus, the

amplitude of the diﬀerential rotation achieved in our simulations is well within the range

spanned in Table 2.

Though the diﬀerential rotation proﬁles in our simulations are not precisely linear

as expressed in equation (A1), these results suggest that the inﬂuence of the diﬀerential

rotation on the oblateness should be negligible.
