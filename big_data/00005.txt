Abstract

There are several background sources which may affect the analysis of data and
detector performance at CLIC. One of the important background sources are halo
muons, which are generated along the beam delivery system (BDS). In order to
reduce the muon background, magnetized muon sweepers have been proposed as a
shielding material [1]. Possible shielding magnet designs have recently been studied
using the tool OPERA. We describe them and estimate the muon background reduc-
tion which can be achieved using the BDSIM Monte Carlo simulation code [2, 3].

(LCWS15), Whistler BC, Canada, 26 November 2015.

1 Introduction

The CLIC (Compact Linear Collider) project has a beam transportation line in order to deliver
the beam from main LINAC to IR (interaction region) and demagnify the beam into desired
parameters at the IR [4].

We use the layout of the BDS described in the CDR [4]. The layout is shown in Figure 1.
After acceleration to full beam energy in the LINAC, the beam enters the diagnostics section of
the BDS where the beam properties are measured and corrected. The beam then traverses the
energy collimation section, where off-momentum particles are removed. Of particular interest
for this study is the third section, the betatron betatron collimation section, which is designed to
remove halo particles. It is followed by the ﬁnal focus region which has strong magnets to focus
the beam to the required beam parameters at the interaction point.

Halo particles will be generated by scattering processes like beam-gas scattering. Other
sources of generating and enhancing the beam halo include optics effects like mismatch and
dispersion, and equipment related effects like noise or mechanical vibrations [5, 6]. For the
study presented here, we use halo distributions generated by the well known elastic and inelastic
interactions of the beam with the residual gas.

The halo is removed in the betatron collimation section by the combination of spoilers and
absorbers. The large amplitude particles which constitute the beam halo will typically ﬁrst
interact with the relatively thin spoilers which are closest to the beam axis, and then be stopped
by the thicker absorbers. There is a small but ﬁnite probability that muons are produced in these
interactions. Muons are much harder to stop and may reach the interaction region and deteriorate
the detector performance. The goal of the study presented here is the mitigation of this secondary
muon ﬂux into the detector region. We propose magnetized muon shields, designed to sweep
away and absorb the majority of the muons before they reach the detector region.

We propose a design with a toroidal magnetic ﬁeld, which is zero on the beam axis. We have
considered two options, one based on permanent magnets and another on normal conducting
magnets.

Figure 2: Magnetic ﬁeld variation corresponding to angle of muon sweeper at various radius

values for different number of Sm-Co blocks.

The magnetic ﬁeld homogeneity depends on number of Sm-Co blocks in the permanent mag-
net option. This is shown for different numbers of Sm-Co blocks in Figure 2. The average ﬁeld
depends on the number of Sm-Co blocks in the magnet. The magnetic ﬁeld values ﬂuctuate
between 1.6 T and 0.8 T for 2 blocks Sm-Co option. For 16 blocks Sm-Co, the magnetic ﬁeld
ﬂuctuation is reduced to values close 1.2 T as shown in Figure 2.

The other option is based on normal conducting coils, which produce an azimuthally sym-
metric ﬁeld shown in Figure 3. The power consumption is estimated at about 120 W for a single
2 meter section. The current density is 0.8 A/mm2 which allows for an air cooled system. The
inner and outer radius of the sweeper in all options is 4 cm and 60 cm, respectively.

3 Estimation of Muon Reduction Rates

The beam delivery system contains four sets of spoilers and absorbers in the betatron collimation
section. We perform detailed, high statistics simulations of the betatron collimation with muon
production and absorption. The muon sweepers are implemented in the simulation studies as
2.5 m long modules with 4 cm inner radius and 60 cm outer radius, with 0.7 T or 1.2 T magnetic
ﬁelds.

For the ﬁrst set of simulations, four modules, each 10 m long with 10 cm space between them,
have been placed after each vertical absorber in the betatron collimation section. This option has
40 m long magnetized shielding in total.

For comparison, we also re-considered the spoiler size and location from the earlier study
described in Ref [1], now based on the more realistic spoiler design presented here and using
the updated version of BDSIM. In the previous study, the muon sweepers have been placed
after each horizontal and vertical absorber, adding up to a total shield length of 80 m. We have
simulated this by placing 32 of our 2.5 m long modules after each absorber as listed in Table 1.

The muon reduction rates have been determined for each geometry for both 0.7 T and 1.2 T
radially homogeneous magnetic ﬁelds. The halo particle distributions, both in position and
energy, have been estimated by using HTGEN [6] as in Figure 4. The halo distribution has been
used as an input parameter for primary particles hitting to the ﬁrst spoiler (YSP1) in the BDSIM
simulations.

4 Conclusion

Magnetic muon shields can signiﬁcantly reduce the number of muons reaching detector region
by deﬂecting them towards the tunnel walls. The reduction rates depend on the magnetic ﬁeld

strength and the total length of the magnetized shielding.

We expect that 39.5±6.3 muons per bunch crossing would reach the detector region in the
absence of magnetized shielding. As for any absolute prediction of the muon ﬂux to the experi-
ments, this number depends on assumptions about the halo. The number given here corresponds
to the halo which is expected from residual gas scattering at design vacuum parameters. It would
increase if the actual rest gas pressure is higher or if the halo is enhanced by other processes.

In the study presented here, we have determined how the muon ﬂux into the detector can be
reduce by magnetized shielding. The numbers obtained in the simulations are listed in Table 2.
A factor of 4 to 6 reduction can is obtained with a 0.7 T magnetic ﬁeld for 40 m and 80 m long
magnetized shielding, respectively. When the magnetic ﬁeld is increased to 1.2 T, the reduction
rates increase to nearly a factor of 10.

muon sweeper parameters have been updated by taking into account the previous study with
updated version of BDSIM. Roughly a factor of 10 reduction have been reached up with 1.2 T

muon backgrounds.
