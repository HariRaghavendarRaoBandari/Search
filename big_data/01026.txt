FUNCTIONALS IN K ¨AHLER GEOMETRY

Abstract. Consider a polarized complex manifold (X, L) and a ray of positive metrics
on L deﬁned by a positive metric on a test conﬁguration for (X, L). For most of the
common functionals in K¨ahler geometry, we prove that the slope at inﬁnity along the ray
is given by evaluating the non-Archimedean version of the functional (as deﬁned in our
earlier paper [BHJ15]) at the non-Archimedean metric on L deﬁned by the test conﬁgu-
ration. Using this asymptotic result, we show that coercivity of the Mabuchi functional
implies uniform K-stability, as deﬁned in [Der14a, BHJ15]. As a partial converse, we show
that uniform K-stability implies coercivity of the Mabuchi functional when restricted to
Bergman metrics.

Introduction

Let (X, L) be a polarized complex manifold. A central problem in K¨ahler geometry is
to give necessary and suﬃcient conditions for the existence of canonical metrics on L, for
example, constant scalar curvature (csc) metrics. To ﬁx ideas, suppose the reduced auto-
morphism group Aut(X, L)/C∗ is discrete. In this case, the celebrated Yau-Tian-Donaldson
conjecture asserts that L admits a csc metric iﬀ (X, L) is K-stable. That K-stability follows
from the existence of a csc metric was proved by Stoppa [Stop09], building upon work by
Donaldson [Don05], but the reverse direction is considered wide open in general.

This situation has led people to introduce stronger stability conditions that would hope-
fully imply the existence of a cscK metric. Building upon ideas of Donaldson [Don05],
Sz´ekelyhidi [Sz´e06] proposed to use a version of K-stability in which, for any test conﬁgu-
ration (X ,L) for (X, L), the Donaldson-Futaki invariant DF(X ,L) is bounded below by a
positive constant times a suitable norm of (X ,L). (See also [Sz´e15] for a related notion.)

Following this lead, we deﬁned in the prequel [BHJ15] to this paper, (X, L) to be uniformly

K-stable if there exists δ > 0 such that

DF(X ,L) ≥ δJ NA(X ,L)

for any normal and ample test conﬁguration (X ,L). Here J NA(X ,L) is a non-Archimedean
analogue of Aubin’s J-functional. It is equivalent to the L1-norm of (X ,L) as well as the
minimum norm considered by Dervan [Der14a]. The norm is zero iﬀ the normalization of
(X ,L) is the trivial test conﬁguration, so uniform K-stability implies K-stability.

In [BHJ15] we advocated the point of view that a test conﬁguration deﬁnes a non-
Archimedean metric on L, that is, a metric on the Berkovich analytiﬁcation of (X, L) with
respect to the trivial norm on the ground ﬁeld C. Further, we deﬁned non-Archimedean
analogues of many classical functionals in K¨ahler geometry. One example is the functional
J NA above. Another is M NA, a non-Archimedean analogue of the Mabuchi K-energy func-
tional M . It agrees with the Donaldson-Futaki invariant, up to an explicit error term, and
uniform K-stability is equivalent to

M NA(X ,L) ≥ δJ NA(X ,L)

for any ample test conﬁguration (X ,L). In [BHJ15] we proved that canonically polarized
manifolds and polarized Calabi-Yau manifolds are always uniformly K-stable.

A ﬁrst goal of this paper is to exhibit precise relations between the non-Archimedean
functionals and their classical counterparts. From now on we do not a priori assume that
the reduced automorphism group of (X, L) is discrete. We prove
Theorem A. Let (X ,L) be an ample test conﬁguration for a polarized complex manifold
(X, L). Consider any smooth strictly positive S1-invariant metric Φ on L deﬁned near the
central ﬁber, and let (φs)s be the corresponding ray of smooth positive metrics on L. Denoting
by M and J the Mabuchi K-energy functional and Aubin J-functional, respectively, we then
have

M (φs)

lim
s→+∞

s

= M NA(X ,L)

and

lim
s→+∞

J(φs)

s

= J NA(X ,L).

The corresponding equalities also hold for several other functionals, see Theorem 3.6.
At least when the total space X is smooth, the assertion in Theorem A regarding the
Mabuchi functional is closely related to several statements appearing in the literature [PRS08,
Corollary 2], [PT09, Corollary 1], [Li12, Remark 12, p.38], following the seminal work [Tia97].
However, to the best of our knowledge, neither the precise statement given here nor its proof
is available in the literature, and we therefore provide full details.

integrals of the form(cid:82)

Xτ

As in [PRS08], the proof of Theorem A uses Deligne pairings, but we also need to estimate
e2Ψ|Xτ , where X → C is a semistable test conﬁguration for X and

Ψ is a smooth metric on KX /C near the central ﬁber, see Lemma 3.9.
Donaldson [Don99] (see also [Mab87, Sem92]) has advocated the point of view that the
space H of positive metrics on L is an inﬁnite-dimensional symmetric space. One can view
the space HNA of positive non-Archimedean metrics on L as (a subset of) the associated
(conical) Tits building.

We then use the asymptotic formulas in Theorem A to study coercivity properties of the

Mabuchi functional. As an immediate consequence of Theorem A, we have

Corollary B. If the Mabuchi functional is coercive in the sense that

M ≥ δJ − C

DF(X ,L) ≥ δJ NA(X ,L)

on H for some positive constants δ and C, then (X, L) is uniformly K-stable, that is,

holds for any normal ample test conﬁguration (X ,L).

Coercivity of the Mabuchi functional is known to hold if X is a K¨ahler-Einstein manifold
without vector ﬁelds. This was ﬁrst established in the Fano case by [PSSW08]; an elegant
proof can be found in [DR15]. As a special case of a very recent result of Berman, Darvas and
Lu [BDL16], coercivity of the Mabuchi functional also holds for general polarized varieties
admitting a metric of constant scalar curvature and having discrete reduced automorphism
group. Thus, if (X, L) admits a constant scalar curvature metric and Aut(X, L)/C∗ is
discrete, then (X, L) is uniformly K-stable. The converse statement is not currently known
in general, but see below for the Fano case.
Next we study coercivity of the Mabuchi functional when restricted to the space of
Bergman metrics. For any m ≥ 1 such that mL is very ample, let Hm be the space of
Fubini-Study type metrics on L, induced by the embedding of X (cid:44)→ PNm via mL.
Theorem C. Fix m such that (X, mL) is linearly normal, and δ > 0. Then the following
conditions are equivalent:

(i) there exists C > 0 such that M ≥ δJ − C on Hm.
(ii) DF(Xλ,Lλ) ≥ δJ NA(Xλ,Lλ) for all 1-parameter subgroups λ of GL(Nm, C);
(iii) M NA(Xλ,Lλ) ≥ δJ NA(Xλ,Lλ) for all 1-parameter subgroups λ of GL(Nm, C).

Here (Xλ,Lλ) is the test conﬁguration deﬁned by λ.

Here the equivalence of (ii) and (iii) stems from the close relation between the Donaldson-
Futaki invariant and the non-Archimedean Mabuchi functional. In view of Theorem A, the
equivalence between (i) and (iii) can be viewed as a generalization of the Hilbert-Mumford
criterion. The proof uses in a crucial way a deep result of Paul [Pau12], which states
that the restrictions to Hm of the Mabuchi functional and the J-functionals have log norm
singularities (see §4).
Since every ample test conﬁguration arises as a 1-parameter subgroup λ of GL(Nm, C)

for some m, Theorem C implies

Corollary D. A polarized manifold (X, L) is uniformly K-stable iﬀ there exist δ > 0 and a
sequence Cm > 0 such that M ≥ δJ − Cm on Hm for all suﬃciently divisible m.

Following Paul and Tian [PT06, PT09], we say that (X, mL) is CM-stable when there

exist C, δ > 0 such that M ≥ δJ − C on Hm.
Corollary E. If (X, L) is uniformly K-stable, then (X, mL) is CM-stable for any suﬃciently
divisible positive integer m. Hence the reduced automorphism group is ﬁnite.

Here the last statement follows from a result by Paul [Pau13, Corollary 1.1].

Let us now comment on the relation of uniform K-stability to the existence of K¨ahler-
Einstein metrics on Fano manifolds. In [CDS15], Chen, Donaldson and Sun proved that a
Fano manifold X admits a K¨ahler-Einstein metric iﬀ it is K-polystable (see also [Tia15]).

4

S´EBASTIEN BOUCKSOM, TOMOYUKI HISAMOTO, AND MATTIAS JONSSON

Since then, several new proofs have a appeared. Datar and Sz´ekelyhidi [DSz15] proved an
equivariant version of the conjecture, using Aubin’s original continuity method. Chen, Sun
and Wang [CSW15] gave a proof using the K¨ahler-Ricci ﬂow.

In [BBJ15], Berman and the ﬁrst and last authors of the current paper used a variational
method to prove a slightly diﬀerent statement: in the absence of vector ﬁelds, the existence of
a K¨ahler-Einstein metric is equivalent to uniform K-stability. In fact, the direct implication
uses Corollary B above.
In §5 we outline a diﬀerent proof of the fact that a uniform K-stable Fano manifold
admits a K¨ahler-Einstein metric. Our method, which largely follows ideas of Tian, relies
on Sz´ekelyhidi’s partial C0-estimates [Sz´e13] along the Aubin continuity path together with
Corollary D.

As noted above, uniform K-stability implies that the reduced automorphism group of
(X, L) is discrete. In the presence of vector ﬁelds, one may hope that there is a notion of
uniform K-polystability. We hope to address this in future work.

There have been several important developments since a ﬁrst draft of the current paper
was circulated. First, Z. Sj¨ostr¨om Dyrefeld [SD16] proved a transcendental version of The-
orem A. Second, as mentioned above, it was proved in [BBJ15] that in the case of a Fano
manifold without holomorphic vector ﬁelds, uniform K-stability is equivalent to coercivity of
the Mabuchi functional and hence to the existence of a K¨ahler-Einstein metric. Finally, the
results in this paper were used in [BDL16] to prove that an arbitrary polarized pair (X, L)
admitting a csc metric must be K-polystable.

The organization of the paper is as follows. In the ﬁrst section, we review several classical
energy functionals in K¨ahler geometry and their interpretation as metrics on a suitable
Deligne pairings. Then, in §2, we recall some non-Archimedean notions from [BHJ15].
Speciﬁcally, a non-Archimedean metric is an equivalence class of test conﬁgurations, and the
non-Archimedean analogues of the energy functionals in §1 are deﬁned using intersection
numbers. In §3 we prove Theorem A relating the classical and non-Archimedean functionals
via subgeodesic rays. Section 4 is devoted to the relation between uniform K-stability
and CM-stability.
In particular, we prove Theorem C and Corollaries D and E. Finally,
in §5, we show how to use Sz´ekelyhidi’s partial C0-estimates along the Aubin continuity
path together with CM-stability to prove that a uniformly K-stable Fano manifold admits
a K¨ahler-Einstein metric.

1. Deligne pairings and energy functionals

In this section we recall the deﬁnition and main properties of the Deligne pairing, as well

as its relation to classical functionals in K¨ahler geometry.

1.1. Metrics on line bundles. We use additive notation for line bundles and metrics. If,
for i = 1, 2, φi is a metric on a line bundle Li on X and ai ∈ Z, then a1φ1 + a2φ2 is a metric
on a1L1 + a2L2. A metric on the trivial line bundle will be identiﬁed with a function on X.
If σ is a (holomorphic) section of a line bundle L on a complex analytic space X, then
log |σ| stands for the corresponding (possibly singular) metric on L. For any metric φ on L,
log |σ| − φ is therefore a function, and

|σ|φ := |σ|e−φ = exp(log |σ| − φ)

is the length of σ in the metric φ.

We normalize the operator dc so that ddc = i

π ∂ ¯∂, and set (somewhat abusively)

ddcφ := −ddc log |σ|φ

for any local trivializing section σ of L. The globally deﬁned (1, 1)-form (or current) ddcφ
is the curvature of φ, normalized so that it represents the (integral) ﬁrst Chern class of L.
If X is a complex manifold, there is a natural bijection between smooth metrics on the
canonical bundle KX and (smooth, positive) volume forms on X, which associates to a
smooth metric φ on KX the volume form e2φ locally deﬁned by

in2σ ∧ ¯σ

e2φ :=

|σ|2

φ

If ω is a positive (1, 1)-form on X and n = dim X, then ωn is a volume form, so − 1

for any local section σ of KX .
2 log ωn
is a metric on −KX in our notation. The Ricci form of ω is deﬁned as the curvature
Ric ω := −ddc 1
2 log ωn of ω of this metric; it is thus a smooth (1, 1)-form in the cohomology
class c1(X) of −KX .
If φ is a smooth positive metric on a line bundle L on X, we denote by Sφ ∈ C∞(X) the

scalar curvature of the K¨ahler form ddcφ; it satisﬁes

Sφ(ddcφ)n = n Ric(ddcφ) ∧ (ddcφ)n−1.

(1.1)

1.2. Deligne pairings. While the construction below works in greater generality [Elk89,
Zha96, MG00], we will restrict ourselves to the following setting. Let π : Y → T be a
ﬂat, projective morphism between smooth complex algebraic varieties, and denote by n its
relative dimension. Given line bundles L0, . . . , Ln on Y , we may consider the intersection
product

L0 · . . . · Ln · [Y ] ∈ CHdim Y −(n+1)(Y ) = CHdim T−1(Y ).

Its push-forward belongs to CHdim T−1(T ) = Pic(T ) since T is smooth, and hence deﬁnes
an isomorphism class of line bundle on T . The Deligne pairing of L0, . . . , Ln selects in a
canonical way a speciﬁc representative of this isomorphism class, denoted by

(cid:104)L0, . . . , Ln(cid:105)Y /T .

The pairing is functorial, multilinear, and commutes with base change. It further satisﬁes
the following key inductive property: if Z0 is a non-singular divisor in Y , ﬂat over T and
deﬁned by a section σ0 ∈ H 0(Y, L0), then we have a canonical identiﬁcation

(1.2)
For n = 0, (cid:104)L0(cid:105)Y /T coincides with the norm of L0 with respect to the ﬁnite ﬂat morphism
Y → T . These properties uniquely characterize the Deligne pairing. Indeed, writing each

(cid:104)L0, . . . , Ln(cid:105)Y /T = (cid:104)L1|Z0, . . . , Ln|Z0(cid:105)Z0/T

6

is very ample. We may thus ﬁnd non-singular divisors Zi ∈ |Li| with(cid:84)

Li as a diﬀerence of very ample line bundles, multilinearity reduces us to the case where Li
i∈I Zi non-singular

and ﬂat over T for each set I of indices, and we get

(cid:104)L0, . . . , Ln(cid:105)Y /T = (cid:104)Ln|Z0∩···∩Zn−1(cid:105)Z0∩···∩Zn−1/T .

1.3. Metrics on Deligne pairings. We use [Elk90, Zha96, Mor99] as references. Given a
smooth metric φj on each Lj, the Deligne pairing (cid:104)L0, . . . , Ln(cid:105)Y /T can be endowed with a
continuous metric

(cid:104)φ0, . . . , φn(cid:105)Y /T ,
(cid:90)

Y /T

smooth over the smooth locus of π, the construction being functorial, multilinear, and
commuting with base change. It is basically constructed by requiring that

(cid:104)φ0, . . . , φn(cid:105)Y /T = (cid:104)φ1|Z0, . . . , φn|Z0(cid:105)Z0/T −

log |σ0|φ0ddcφ1 ∧ ··· ∧ ddcφn

(1.3)

in the notation of (1.2), with (cid:82)
(cid:82)

Y /T denoting ﬁber integration, i.e. the push-forward by π
as a current. By induction, the continuity of the metric (cid:104)φ0, . . . , φn(cid:105) reduces to that of
Y /T log |σ0|φ0ddcφ1 ∧ ··· ∧ ddcφn, and thus follows from [Stol66, Theorem 4.9].

Remark 1.1. As explained in [Elk90, I.1], arguing by induction, the key point in checking
that (1.3) is well-deﬁned is the following symmetry property: if σ1 ∈ H 0(Y, L1) is a section
with divisor Z1 such that both Z1 and Z0 ∩ Z1 are non-singular and ﬂat over T , then

with α = ddcφ2 ∧···∧ ddcφn. By the Lelong-Poincar´e formula, the above equality reduces to

π∗ (log |σ0|φ0ddc log |σ1|φ1 ∧ α) = π∗ (log |σ1|φ1ddc log |σ0|φ0 ∧ α) ,

which holds by Stokes’ formula applied to a monotone regularization of the quasi-psh func-
tions log |σi|φi.

Metrics on Deligne pairings satisfy the following two crucial properties, which are direct

consequences of (1.3).

(i) The curvature current of (cid:104)φ0, . . . , φn(cid:105)Y /T satisﬁes

ddc(cid:104)φ0, . . . , φn(cid:105)Y /T =

that is, (half) the relative entropy of the probability measure MA(φ) with respect

(v) The Mabuchi functional (or K-energy) can now be deﬁned via the Chen-Tian for-

mula [Che00] (see also [BB14, Proposition 3.1]) as

M (φ) = H(φ) + R(φ) + ¯SE(φ).

(1.11)

These functionals vanish at φref and satisfy the variational formulas:

δE(φ) = MA(φ) = V −1(ddcφ)n
δEθ(φ) = nV −1(ddcφ)n−1 ∧ θ
δR(φ) = −nV −1(ddcφ)n−1 ∧ Ric(ddcφref )
δH(φ) = nV −1(ddcφ)n−1 ∧ (Ric(ddcφref ) − Ric(ddcφ))
δM (φ) = ( ¯S − Sφ) MA(φ)

In particular, the critical points of M are csc metrics.

The functionals I, J and I − J are comparable in the sense that

on H. For φ ∈ H we have J(φ) ≥ 0, with equality iﬀ φ − φref is constant. These properties
are thus also shared by I and I − J.
The functionals H, I, J, M are translation invariant in the sense that H(φ + c) = H(φ)
for c ∈ R. For E and R we instead have E(φ + c) = E(φ) + c and R(φ + c) = R(φ) − ¯Sc,
respectively.

1.5. Energy functionals as Deligne pairings. The functionals above can be expressed
using Deligne pairings, an observation going back at least to [PS04]. Any metric φ ∈
H induces a smooth metric 1
2 log MA(φ) on KX . The following identities are now easy
consequences of the change of metric formula (1.5).

Remark 1.3. The formulas above make it evident that instead of ﬁxing a reference metric
φref ∈ H, we could view E, H + R and M as metrics on suitable multiples of the complex
lines (cid:104)Ln+1(cid:105)X , (cid:104)KX , Ln(cid:105)X , and (n + 1)(cid:104)KX , Ln(cid:105)X + ¯S(cid:104)Ln+1(cid:105)X , respectively.
1.6. The Ding functional. Now suppose X is a Fano manifold, that is, L := −KX is
ample. Any metric φ on L then induces a positive volume form e−2φ on X. The Ding
functional [Din88] on H is deﬁned by

This functional, ﬁrst introduced in [Din88], has proven an extremely useful tool for the study
of the existence of K¨ahler-Einstein metrics, which are realized as the critical points of D,
see e.g. [Berm15, BBJ15].

2. Test configurations as non-Archimedean metrics

In this section we recall some notions and results from [BHJ15]. Let X be a smooth

projective complex variety and L a line bundle on X.

2.1. Test conﬁgurations. As in [BHJ15] we adopt the following ﬂexible terminology for
test conﬁgurations.
Deﬁnition 2.1. A test conﬁguration X for X consists of the following data:

(i) a ﬂat, projective morphism of schemes π : X → C;
(ii) a C∗-action on X lifting the canonical action on C;
(iii) an isomorphism X1 (cid:39) X.
We denote by τ the coordinate in C, and by Xτ the ﬁber over τ .
Since X is in particular a variety, i.e. reduced and irreducible, so is X (cf. [BHJ15,
Proposition 2.6]). If X ,X (cid:48) are test conﬁgurations for X, then there is a unique C∗-equivariant
birational map X (cid:48) (cid:57)(cid:57)(cid:75) X compatible with the isomorphism in (iii). We say that X (cid:48) dominates
X if this birational map is a morphism; when it is an isomorphism we somewhat abusively

identify X and X (cid:48). Any test conﬁguration X is dominated by its normalization (cid:101)X .

Deﬁnition 2.2. A test conﬁguration (X ,L) for (X, L) consists of a test conﬁguration X
for X, together with the following additional data:

(iv) a C∗-linearized Q-line bundle L on X ;
(v) an isomorphism (X1,L1) (cid:39) (X, L).
A pull-back of a test conﬁguration (X ,L) is a test conﬁguration (X (cid:48),L(cid:48)) where X (cid:48) domi-

nates X and L(cid:48) is the pull-back of L. In particular, the normalization ((cid:101)X , ˜L) is the pull-back
of (X ,L) with ν : (cid:101)X → X the normalization morphism.

A test conﬁguration (X ,L) is trivial if X = X × C with C∗ acting trivially on X. This
implies that (X ,L + cX0) = (X, L) × C for some constant c ∈ Q. A test conﬁguration for
(X, L) is almost trivial if its normalization is trivial.
We say that (X ,L) is ample (resp. semiample, resp. nef) when L is relatively ample (resp.
relatively semiample, resp. nef). The pullback of a semiample (resp. nef) test conﬁguration
is semiample (resp. nef).
If L is ample, then for every semiample test conﬁguration (X ,L) there exists a unique
ample test conﬁguration (Xamp,Lamp) that is dominated by (X ,L) and satisﬁes µ∗OX =
OXamp, where µ : X → Xamp is the canonical morphism; see [BHJ15, Proposition 2.17].
Note that while X can often be chosen smooth, Xamp will not be smooth, in general.

2.2. One-parameter subgroups. Suppose L is ample. Ample test conﬁgurations are then
essentially equivalent to one-parameter degenerations of X. See [BHJ15, §2.3] for details on
what follows. Fix m ≥ 1 such that mL is very ample, and consider the corresponding closed
embedding X (cid:44)→ PNm−1 with Nm := h0(X, mL). Then every 1-parameter subgroup (1-PS
for short) λ : C∗ → GL(Nm, C) induces an ample test conﬁguration (Xλ,Lλ) for (X, L).
By deﬁnition, Xλ is the Zariski closure in PV × C of the image of the closed embedding
X × C∗ (cid:44)→ PV × C∗ mapping (x, τ ) to (λ(τ )x, τ ). Note that λ is trivial iﬀ (Xλ,Lλ) is, while
(Xλ,Lλ) is a product iﬀ λ preserves X. Note that Xλ is not normal in general.
In fact, every ample test conﬁguration may be obtained as above, see e.g. [BHJ15, §2.3].
Using one-parameter subgroups, we can produce test conﬁgurations that are almost trivial
but not trivial, as observed in [LX14, Remark 5]. See [BHJ15, Proposition 2.12] for an
elementary proof of the following result.
Proposition 2.3. For every m divisible enough, there exists a 1-PS λ : C∗ → GL(Nm, C)
such that the test conﬁguration (Xλ,Lλ) is nontrivial but almost trivial.

2.3. Valuations and log discrepancies. By a valuation on X we mean a real-valued
valuation v on the function ﬁeld C(X) (trivial on the ground ﬁeld C). The trivial valuation
vtriv is deﬁned by vtriv(f ) = 0 for f ∈ C(X)∗. A valuation v is divisorial if it is of the form
v = c ordF , where c ∈ Q>0 and F is a prime divisor on a projective normal variety admitting
a birational morphism onto X. We denote by X div the set of valuations on X that are either
divisorial or trivial, and equip it with the weakest topology such that v (cid:55)→ v(f ) is continuous
for every f ∈ C(X)∗.

The log discrepancy AX (v) of a valuation in X div is deﬁned as follows. First we set
AX (vtriv) = 0. For v = c ordF a (nontrivial) divisorial valuation as above, we set AX =
c(1 + ordF (KY /X )), where KY /X is the relative canonical (Weil) divisor.
Now consider a normal test conﬁguration X of X. Since C(X ) (cid:39) C(X)(τ ), any valuation
w on X restricts to a valuation r(w) on X. Let E be an irreducible component of the central

ﬁber X0 =(cid:80) bEE. Then ordE is a C∗-invariant divisorial valuation on C(X ) and satisﬁes

If we set vE := r(b−1

E ordE), then vE is a valuation in X div. Conversely,
ordE(t) = bE.
every valuation v ∈ X div has a unique C∗-invariant preimage w under r normalized by
w(τ ) = 1, and w is associated to an irreducible component of the central ﬁber of some test
conﬁguration for X, cf. [BHJ15, Theorem 4.6].
Note that ordE is a divisorial valuation on X × C. By [BHJ15, Proposition 4.11], the log

discrepancies of ordE and vE are related as follows: AX×C(ordE) = bE(1 + AX (vE)).

2.4. Compactiﬁcations. For some purposes it is convenient to compactify test conﬁgura-
tions. The following notion provides a canonical way of doing so.
Deﬁnition 2.4. The compactiﬁcation ¯X of a test conﬁguration X for X is deﬁned by gluing
together X and X × (P1 \{0}) along their respective open subsets X \X0 and X × (C\{0}),
which are identiﬁed using the canonical C∗-equivariant isomorphism X \X0 (cid:39) X × (C\{0}).
The compactiﬁcation comes with a C∗-equivariant ﬂat morphism ¯X → P1, still denoted
by π. By construction, π−1(P1 \ {0}) is C∗-equivariantly isomorphic to X × (P1 \ {0}) over
P1 \ {0}.
Similarly, a test conﬁguration (X ,L) for (X, L) admits a compactiﬁcation ( ¯X , ¯L), where
¯L is a C∗-linearized Q-line bundle on ¯X . Note that ¯L is relatively (semi)ample iﬀ L is.
2.5. Non-Archimedean metrics. Following [BHJ15, §6] (see also [BJ16a]) we introduce:
Deﬁnition 2.5. Two test conﬁgurations (X1,L1), (X2,L2) for (X, L) are equivalent if there
exists a test conﬁguration (X3,L3) that is a pull-back of both (X1,L1) and (X2,L2). An
equivalence class is called a non-Archimedean metric on L, and is denoted by φ. We denote
by φtriv the equivalence class of the trivial test conﬁguration (X, L) × C.

A non-Archimedean metric φ is called semipositive if some (or, equivalently, any) repre-

sentative (X ,L) of φ is nef. Note that this implies that L is nef.
When L is ample, we say that a non-Archimedean metric φ on L is positive if some (or,
equivalently, any) representative (X ,L) of φ is semiample. We denote by HNA the set of
all non-Archimedean positive metrics on L. By [BHJ15, Lemma 6.3], every φ ∈ HNA is
represented by a unique normal, ample test conﬁguration.

The set of non-Archimedean metrics on a line bundle L admits two natural operations:
(i) a translation action of Q, denoted by φ (cid:55)→ φ + c, and induced by (X ,L) (cid:55)→ (X ,L +

cX0);

UNIFORM K-STABILITY AND ASYMPTOTICS OF ENERGY FUNCTIONALS

11

(ii) a scaling action of the semigroup N∗ of positive integers, denoted by φ (cid:55)→ φd and

induced by the base change of (X ,L) by τ (cid:55)→ τ d.

When L is ample (resp. nef) these operations preserve the set of positive (resp. semipositive)
metrics. The trivial metric φtriv is ﬁxed by the scaling action.
As in §1.1 we use additive notation for non-Archimedean metrics. A non-Archimedean
metric on OX induces a bounded (and continuous) function on X div.
Remark 2.6. As explained in [BHJ15, §6.5], a non-Archimedean metric φ on L as deﬁned
above can be viewed as a metric on the Berkovich analytiﬁcation [Berk90] of L with respect
to the trivial absolute value on the ground ﬁeld C. See also [BJ16a] for a more systematic
analysis, itself building upon [BFJ16, BFJ15a].

2.6. Intersection numbers and Monge-Amp`ere measures. We can deﬁne the intersec-
tion number (φ0 · . . .· φn) of non-Archimedean metrics φ0, . . . , φn on line bundles L0, . . . , Ln
on X as follows. Pick representatives (X ,Li) of φi, 0 ≤ i ≤ n, with the same test conﬁgu-
ration X for X and set
where ( ¯X , ¯Li) is the compactiﬁcation of (X ,Li).
that this is well-deﬁned, independent of the choice of Li. Note that (φn+1

L0 = OX , so that L0 = OX (D) for a Q-Cartier Q-divisor D =(cid:80) rEE supported on X0, we
can compute the intersection number as (φ0 · . . . · φn) =(cid:80)

It follows from the projection formula
triv ) = 0. When

(φ0 · . . . · φn) := ( ¯L0 · . . . · ¯Ln),

E rE(L1|E · . . . · Ln|E).

An n-tuple (φ1, . . . , φn) of non-Archimedean metrics on line bundles L1, . . . Ln induces a
signed ﬁnite atomic mixed Monge-Amp`ere measure on X div as follows. Pick representatives
(X ,Li) of φi, 1 ≤ i ≤ n, with the same test conﬁguration X for X and set
bE(L1|E · . . . · Ln|E)δvE ,

MANA(φ1, . . . , φn) = V −1(cid:88)

E

where E ranges over irreducible components of X0 =(cid:80)

E bEE, and vE = r(b−1

E ordE) ∈ X div.
When the φi are semipositive, the mixed Monge-Amp`ere measure is a probability measure.
As in the complex case, we also write MANA(φ) for MANA(φ, . . . , φ).
2.7. Functionals on non-Archimedean metrics. Following [BHJ15, §7] we deﬁne non-
Archimedean analogues of the functionals considered in §1.4. Fix a line bundle L.
Deﬁnition 2.7. Let W be a set of non-Archimedean metrics on L that is closed under
translation and scaling. A functional F : W → R is

(i) homogeneous if F (φd) = dF (φ) for φ ∈ W and d ∈ N∗;
(ii) translation invariant if F (φ + c) = F (φ) for φ ∈ W and c ∈ Q.
When L is ample, a functional F on HNA may be viewed as a function F (X ,L) on
the set of all semiample test conﬁgurations (X ,L) that is invariant under pull-back, i.e.
F (X (cid:48),L(cid:48)) = F (X ,L) whenever (X (cid:48),L(cid:48)) is a pull-back of a (X ,L) (and, in particular, invariant
under normalization). Homogeneity amounts to F (Xd,Ld) = d F (X ,L) for all d ∈ N∗, and
translation invariance to F (X ,L) = F (X ,L + cX0) for all c ∈ Q.
For each non-Archimedean metric φ on L, choose a normal representative (X ,L) that
dominates X × C via ρ : X → X × C. Then L = ρ∗(L × C) + D for a uniquely deter-
E bEE and let ( ¯X , ¯L) be the
compactiﬁcation of (X ,L).

In this notation, we may describe our list of non-Archimedean functionals as follows.
Assume L is big and nef. Let φtriv and ψtriv be the trivial metrics on L and KX , respectively.

Note the resemblance to the formulas in §1.5. All of these functionals are homogeneous.
They are also translation invariant, except for ENA and RNA which satisfy

ENA(φ + c) = ENA(φ) + c and RNA(φ + c) = RNA(φ) + ¯Sc

(2.1)

for all φ ∈ HNA and c ∈ Q.

The functionals I NA, J NA and I NA − J NA are comparable on semipositive metrics in the
same way as (1.12). By [BHJ15, Lemma 7.6], when φ is positive, the ﬁrst term in the
deﬁnition of J NA satisﬁes

normal ample test conﬁguration (X ,L) representing φ ∈ HNA we also denote the J-norm by
J NA(X ,L).

2.8. The Donaldson-Futaki invariant. As explained in [BHJ15], the non-Archimedean
Mabuchi functional is closely related to the Donaldson-Futaki invariant. We have
Proposition 2.8. Assume L is ample. Let φ ∈ HNA be the class of an ample test conﬁg-

uration (X ,L), and denote by ((cid:101)X , ˜L) its normalization, which is thus the unique normal,

ample representative of φ. Then

M NA(φ) = DF((cid:101)X , ˜L) − V −1(cid:16)
DF(X ,L) = DF((cid:101)X , ˜L) + 2V −1(cid:88)

one and X0 is generically reduced.

(2.2)

Indeed, (2.2) follows from the discussion in [BHJ15, §7.3].
For a general non-Archimedean metric φ on L we can deﬁne

DF(φ) = M (φ) + V −1(cid:0)(X0 − X0,red) · ¯Ln(cid:1)

= V −1(cid:16)

K ¯X /P1 · ¯Ln(cid:17)

for any normal representative (X ,L) of φ. Clearly M NA(φ) ≤ DF(φ) when φ is semipositive.

2.9. The non-Archimedean Ding functional. Suppose X is weakly Fano, that is, L :=
−KX is big and nef. In this case, we deﬁne the non-Archimedean Ding functional on the
set of non-Archimedean metrics on L by

DNA(φ) = LNA(φ) − ENA(φ),

where LNA is deﬁned by

LNA(φ) = inf
v

(AX (v) + (φ − φtriv)(v)) ,

the inﬁmum taken over all valuations v on X that are divisorial or trivial. Recall from §2.5
that φ − φtriv is a non-Archimedean metric on OX and induces a bounded function on
divisorial valuations. Note that LNA(φ+c) = LNA(φ)+c; hence DNA is translation invariant.

We have DNA ≤ M NA and DNA ≤ J NA, see [BHJ15, Proposition 7.25].

2.10. Uniform K-stability. As in [BHJ15] we make the following deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 2.9. A polarized complex manifold (X, L) is uniformly K-stable if there exists
a constant δ > 0 such that the following equivalent conditions hold.

(i) M NA(φ) ≥ δJ NA(φ) for every φ ∈ HNA(L);
(ii) DF(φ) ≥ δJ NA(φ) for every φ ∈ HNA(L);
(iii) DF(X ,L) ≥ δJ NA(X ,L) for any normal ample test conﬁguration (X ,L).

14

S´EBASTIEN BOUCKSOM, TOMOYUKI HISAMOTO, AND MATTIAS JONSSON

Here the equivalence between (ii) and (iii) is deﬁnitional, and (i) =⇒ (ii) follows immedi-
ately from DF ≤ M NA. The implication (ii) =⇒ (i) follows from the homogeneity of M NA
together with the fact that DF(φd) = M NA(φd) for d suﬃciently divisible. See [BHJ15,
Proposition 8.2] for details.

The fact that J NA(φ) = 0 iﬀ φ = φtriv + c implies that uniform K-stability is stronger
than K-stability as introduced by [Don02]. Our notion of uniform K-stability is equivalent
to uniform K-stability deﬁned either with respect to the L1-norm or the minimum norm in
the sense of [Der14a], see [BHJ15, §8.1].

In the Fano case, uniform K-stability is further equivalent to uniform Ding stability:

Theorem 2.10. Assume L := −KX is ample and ﬁx a number δ with 0 ≤ δ ≤ 1. Then the
following conditions are equivalent:

(i) M NA ≥ δJ NA on HNA;
(ii) DNA ≥ δJ NA on HNA.
This is proved in [BHJ15, §8.2] using the Minimal Model Program as in [LX14]. See

also [Fuj15, Fuj16].

In this section we prove Theorem A and Corollary B.

3. Non-Archimedean limits

3.1. Rays of metrics and non-Archimedean limits. For any line bundle L on X, there
is a bijection between smooth rays (φs)s>0 of metrics on L and S1-invariant smooth metrics
Φ on the pull-back of L to X × ∆∗, with ∆∗ = ∆∗
1 ⊂ C the punctured unit disc. The
restriction of Φ to L|Xτ for τ ∈ ∆∗ is given by pullback of φlog |τ|−1 under the map Xτ → X
given by the C∗-action. Similarly, smooth rays (φs)s>s0 correspond to S1-invariant smooth
metrics on the pull-back of L to X × ∆∗

r0, with r0 = e−s0.

A subgeodesic ray is a ray (φs) whose corresponding metric Φ is semipositive. Such rays

can of course only exist when L is nef.

Deﬁnition 3.1. We say that a smooth ray (φs) admits a non-Archimedean metric φNA as
non-Archimedean limit if there exists a test conﬁguration (X ,L) representing φNA such that
the metric Φ on L × ∆∗ extends to a smooth metric on L over ∆.

In other words, a non-Archimedean limit exists iﬀ Φ has analytic singularities along
X × {0}, i.e. splits into a smooth part and a divisorial part after pulling-back to a blow-up.
Lemma 3.2. Given a ray (φs) in H, the non-Archimedean limit φNA ∈ HNA is unique, if
it exists.

Proof. Let ψ1 and ψ2 be non-Archimedean limits of (φs)s and let Φ be the smooth metric
on L∆∗ deﬁned by the ray (φs). For i = 1, 2, pick a representative (Xi,Li) of ψi such that
Φ extends as a smooth metric on Li over ∆. After replacing (Xi,Li) by suitable pullbacks,
we may assume X1 = X2 = : X and that X is normal. Then L2 = L1 + D for a Q-divisor D
supported on X0. Now a smooth metric on L1 induces a singular metric on L1 + D that is
smooth iﬀ D = 0. Hence L1 = L2, so that ψ1 = ψ2.
(cid:3)
Remark 3.3. Following [Berk09, §2] (see also [Jon16, BJ16b]) one can construct a com-
pact Hausdorﬀ space X An ﬁbering over the interval [0, 1] such that the ﬁber X An
over any

ρ

UNIFORM K-STABILITY AND ASYMPTOTICS OF ENERGY FUNCTIONALS

15

point ρ ∈ (0, 1] is homeomorphic to the complex manifold X, and the ﬁber X An
over 0 is
homeomorphic to the Berkovich analytiﬁcation of X with respect to the trivial norm on C.
Similarly, the line bundle L induces a line bundle LAn over X An. If a ray (φs)s>0 admits a
non-Archimedean limit φNA, then it induces a continuous metric on LAn whose restriction
to LAn
is given by φNA. In this way, φNA
is indeed the limit of φs as s → ∞.

Deﬁnition 3.4. A functional F : H → R admits a functional F NA : HNA → R as a

Archimedean limit φNA ∈ HNA, we have

Proposition 3.5. If F : H → R admits a non-Archimedean limit F NA : HNA → R, then
F NA is homogeneous.
Proof. Consider a semiample test conﬁguration (X ,L) representing a non-Archimedean met-
ric φNA ∈ HNA, and let (φs)s be a smooth subgeodesic ray compatible with (X ,L). For
d ≥ 1, let (Xd,Ld) be the normalized base change induced by τ → τ d. The associated non-
is then the non-Archimedean limit of the subgeodesic ray (φds), so

lims→∞ s−1F (φds) = F NA(φNA
lims→∞ s−1F (φs) = F NA(φNA). The result follows.

3.3. Asymptotics of the functionals. The following result immediately implies Theo-
rem A and Corollary B.
Theorem 3.6. The functionals E, H, I, J, M and R on H admit non-Archimedean limits
on HNA given, respectively, by ENA, H NA, I NA, J NA, M NA and RNA.

In addition, we have the following result due to Berman. For the proof, see [Berm15,

Proposition 3.8] and also [BBJ15, Theorem 3.1] for a more general result.
Theorem 3.7. If L := −KX is ample, then the Ding functional D on H admits DNA on
HNA as non-Archimedean limit.

The main tool in the proof of Theorem 3.6 is the following result.

Lemma 3.8. For i = 0, . . . , n, let Li be a line bundle on X with a smooth reference metric
φi,ref . Let also (X ,Li) be a smooth test conﬁguration for (X, Li), Φi an S1-invariant smooth
metric on Li near X0, and denote by (φs
i ) the corresponding ray of smooth metrics on Li.
Then

n(cid:105)X − (cid:104)φ0,ref , . . . , φn,ref(cid:105)X = s(cid:0) ¯L0 · . . . · ¯Ln

denotes the Deligne pairing with respect to the constant morphism X → {pt}.
Proof. The Deligne pairing F := (cid:104)L0, . . . ,Ln(cid:105)X /C is a line bundle on C, endowed with a C∗-
action and a canonical identiﬁcation of its ﬁber at τ = 1 with the complex line (cid:104)L0, . . . , Ln(cid:105)X .

It extends to a line bundle (cid:104) ¯L0, . . . , ¯Ln(cid:105) ¯X /P1 on P1 that is C∗-equivariantly trivial near
P1 (cid:114) {0}. Denoting by w ∈ Z the weight of the C∗-action on the ﬁber at 0, we have

w = deg(cid:104) ¯L0, . . . , ¯Ln(cid:105) ¯X /P1 =(cid:0) ¯L0, . . . , ¯Ln

(cid:1) .

Pick a nonzero vector v ∈ F1 = (cid:104)L0, . . . , Ln(cid:105)X . The C∗-action produces a section τ (cid:55)→ τ · v
of F on C∗, and σ := τ−w(τ · v) is a nowhere vanishing section of F on C, see [BHJ15,
Corollary 1.4].
Since the metrics Φi are smooth and S1-invariant, Ψ := (cid:104)Φ0, . . . , Φn(cid:105)X /C is a continuous
S1-invariant metric on F near 0 ∈ C. It follows that the function log |σ|Ψ is bounded near
0 ∈ C.
The S1-invariant metric Ψ deﬁnes a ray (ψs) of metrics on the line F1 through |v|ψs =
|τ · v|Ψτ , for s = log |τ|−1, where Ψτ is the restriction of Ψ to Fτ . Thus

log |v|ψs = log |τ · v|Ψτ = w log |τ| + log |σ|Ψτ = −sw + O(1).
By functoriality, the metric ψs on F1 is nothing but the Deligne pairing (cid:104)φs

Proof of Theorem 3.6. Let (φs)s be a smooth subgeodesic ray in H admitting a non-Archimedean
limit φNA ∈ HNA, and let (X ,L) be a smooth, semiample test conﬁguration representing
φNA, such that (φs)s induces a smooth metric Φ on L over ∆. By Lemma 1.2, we have

(n + 1)V [E(φs) − E(φref )] = (cid:104)φs, . . . , φs(cid:105)X − (cid:104)φref , . . . , φref(cid:105)X .

which proves the result for the Monge-Amp`ere energy E. The case of the functionals I,
J and R is similarly a direct consequence of Lemma 1.2 and Lemma 3.8. In view of the
Chen-Tian formulas for M and M NA, it remains to treat the case of the entropy functional
H. In fact, it turns out to be easier to treat the functional H + R.
Using the semistable reduction theorem [KKMS] as in [ADVLN11], we may choose d such
that the base change (Xd,Ld) admits a semistable pull-back. By homogeneity of H NA +RNA
with respect to base change, we may thus assume from the outset that X is semistable. Note,
however, that L is now only relatively semiample and Φ only semipositive.

By Lemma 1.2 we have

4.1. Functions with log norm singularities. In this section, G denotes a reductive
complex algebraic group.
Deﬁnition 4.1. We say that a function f : G → R has log norm singularities if there exist
ﬁnitely many rational numbers ai, ﬁnite dimensional complex vector spaces Vi endowed with
a G-action and non-zero vectors vi ∈ Vi such that

(cid:88)

f (g) =

ai log (cid:107)g · vi(cid:107) + O(1)

for some choice of norms on the Vi’s.

i

Remark 4.2. By the equivalence of norms on a ﬁnite dimensional vector space, the descrip-
tion of f is independent of the choice of norms on the Vi. In particular, given a maximal
compact subgroup K of G, the norms may be assumed to be K-invariant, so that f descends
to a function on the Riemannian symmetric space G/K.

Remark 4.3. Taking appropriate tensor products, is is easy to see that every function f on
G with log norm singularities may be written as

f (g) = a (log (cid:107)g · v(cid:107) − log (cid:107)g · w(cid:107)) + O(1),

(4.1)
where a ∈ Q>0 and v, w are vectors in a normed vector space V endowed with a G-action.
The following generalization of the Kempf-Ness/Hilbert-Mumford criterion is closely re-
lated to results of [Pau13], which they simplify to some extent. Our elementary argument
is inspired by the discussion on pp.241–243 of [Tho06].

Theorem 4.4. Let f be a function on G with log norm singularities.
(i) For each 1-PS λ : C∗ → G, there exists f NA(λ) ∈ Q such that

(f ◦ λ)(τ ) = f NA(λ) log |τ|−1 + O(1)

for |τ| ≤ 1.

(ii) f is bounded below on G iﬀ f NA(λ) ≥ 0 for all 1-PS λ.
The chosen notation stems from the fact that f NA induces a function on the (conical)

Tits building of G, i.e. the non-Archimedean analogue of G/K (compare [MFF, §2.2]).

Before entering the proof, let us recall some basic facts about representations of algebraic

tori. Let T (cid:39) (C∗)r be an algebraic torus, and introduce as usual the dual lattices

M := Hom(T, C∗) (cid:39) Zr

and N := Hom(C∗, T ) (cid:39) Zr.

decomposition V = (cid:76)

Note that N is the group of 1-PS of T . For each ﬁnite-dimensional vector space V on
which T acts and each m ∈ M , let Vm ⊂ V be the subspace on which each t ∈ T acts by
multiplication by m(t). The action of T on V being diagonalizable, we have a direct sum
m∈M Vm, and the set of weights of V is deﬁned as the (ﬁnite) set
MV ⊂ M of characters m ∈ M for which Vm (cid:54)= 0.
Given a non-zero vector v ∈ V , the set Mv ⊂ MV of weights of v is deﬁned as those
m ∈ M for which the projection vm ∈ Vm of v is non-zero. The weight polytope of v is
deﬁned as the convex hull Pv ⊂ MR of Mv in MR, whose support function hv : NR → R is
the convex, positively homogeneous function deﬁned by
(cid:104)m, λ(cid:105),

hv(λ) = max
m∈Mv

S´EBASTIEN BOUCKSOM, TOMOYUKI HISAMOTO, AND MATTIAS JONSSON

where the bracket denotes the dual pairing between MR and NR.

Proof of Theorem 4.4. By Remark 4.3 we may assume f is of the form

f (g) := log (cid:107)g · v(cid:107) − log (cid:107)g · w(cid:107),

where v, w are nonzero vectors in a ﬁnite dimensional normed vector space V equipped with
a G-action.
(i) Let ﬁrst λ : C∗ → G be a 1-parameter subgroup, and denote by Iv ⊂ Z the set of

weights of v with respect to λ. We then have
λ(τ ) · v =

τ mvm,

log (cid:107)λ(τ ) · v(cid:107) = max
m∈Iv

(m log |τ| + log (cid:107)vm(cid:107)) + O(1) = −
for |τ| ≤ 1, and (i) follows with f NA(λ) = min Iw − min Iv.
(ii) The direct implication follows immediately from (i). For the reverse implication
we use the Cartan (or polar) decomposition G = KT K, where T ⊂ G is any maximal
algebraic torus and K ⊂ G be a maximal compact subgroup. We then get an isomorphism
T /K ∩ T (cid:39) NR, hence a group homomorphism

((cid:104)m, Log |t|(cid:105) + log (cid:107)(k · v)m)(cid:107)) + O(1).

By the compactness of K, we further may ﬁnd C = C(v) > 0 such that

−C ≤ log (cid:107)(k · v)m(cid:107) ≤ C

for all k ∈ K and all m ∈ Mk·v. By the deﬁnition of the support function hk·v, we thus have

((cid:104)m, Log |t|(cid:105) + log (cid:107)(k · v)m)(cid:107)) = hk·v(Log |t|) + O(1).

m∈Mk·v

which in compatible bases for T (cid:39) C∗r and NR (cid:39) Rr is given by

Note that

Log |λ(τ )| = (log |τ|)λ

in NR for each 1-PS λ : C∗ → T (i.e. λ ∈ N ).

In this notation, we claim that

for all k, k(cid:48) ∈ K and t ∈ T .
all k, k(cid:48) ∈ K and t ∈ T

log (cid:107)(k(cid:48)tk) · v(cid:107) = log (cid:107)t · (k · v)(cid:107) = log (cid:107) (cid:88)

m(t)(k · v)m(cid:107)

f (k(cid:48)tk) = hk·v(Log |t|) − hk·w(Log |t|) + O(1),

(4.2)

To see that (4.2) holds, we may assume the norm on V is K-invariant. We then have for

UNIFORM K-STABILITY AND ASYMPTOTICS OF ENERGY FUNCTIONALS

21

We have thus proved that

log (cid:107)(k(cid:48)tk) · v(cid:107) = hk·v(Log |t|) + O(1).

A similar estimate of course holds with w in place of v, and (4.2) follows.

As a consequence of (4.2), we get

f NA(k−1λk) = hk·v(λ) − hk·w(λ)

(4.3)
If we assume that f NA ≥ 0 on all 1-PS of G, then hk·v ≥ hk·w on N ,
for all λ ∈ N .
hence on NQ by homogeneity, and hence on NR by density. From (4.2) and the Cartan
decomposition G = KT K it follows, as desired, that f is bounded below on G. The proof
(cid:3)
is now complete.

4.2. Proof of Theorem C and Corollaries D and E. Replacing L with mL, we may
assume for notational simplicity that m = 1. Set N := h0(L) and G := SL(N, C), so
that each σ ∈ G deﬁnes a Fubini-Study type metric φσ on L. Note that M − δJ is bounded
below on H1 (cid:39) GL(N, C)/ U(N ) iﬀ M (φσ)−δJ(φσ) bounded below for σ ∈ G, by translation
invariance of M and J.

The key ingredient is the following result of S. Paul [Pau12].

Theorem 4.5. The functionals E, J and M all have log norm singularities on G.

lim
s→+∞

s

Granted this result we can deduce Theorem C. The equivalence of (ii) and (iii) follows
from the same argument as Lemma 7.22 in [BHJ15], so it suﬃces to show that (i) and (iii)
are equivalent. By Theorem 4.5, the function f (σ) := M (φσ) − δJ(φσ) on G has log norm
singularities. By Theorem 4.4, it is thus bounded below iﬀ
≥ 0

(f ◦ λ)(e−s)

for each 1-parameter subgroup λ : C∗ → G. We obtain the desired result since by Theorem B,
this limit is equal to M NA(φλ)− δJ NA(φλ), where φλ ∈ HNA is the non-Archimedean metric
on L deﬁned by λ.
Corollary D follows since every ample test conﬁguration of (X, L) is induced by a 1-PS,
see §2.2. The ﬁrst assertion of Corollary E follows immediately, and the fact that the reduced
automorphism group of (X, L) is ﬁnite is a consequence of [Pau13, Corollary 1.1].
Proof of Theorem 4.5. Recall from [Pau12] that to the linearly normal embedding X (cid:44)→
PH 0(X, L)∗ (cid:39) PN−1 are associated the X-resultant R, i.e. the Chow coordinate of X, and
the X-hyperdiscriminant ∆, which cuts out the dual variety of
X × Pn−1 (cid:44)→ PN−1 × Pn−1 (cid:44)→ PN n−1,

In our notation, we then have deg R = V (n + 1) and deg ∆ = V (cid:0)n(n + 1) − ¯S(cid:1) [Pau12,

the second arrow being the Segre embedding.

Proposition 5.7], and [Pau12, Theorem A] becomes

M (φσ) = V −1 log (cid:107)σ · ∆(cid:107) − V −1 deg ∆
deg R

log (cid:107)σ · R(cid:107) + O(1),

(4.4)

which proves the assertion for M (φσ).

We next consider

J(φσ) =

(φσ − φref ) MA(φref ) − E(φσ).

(cid:90)

X

22

S´EBASTIEN BOUCKSOM, TOMOYUKI HISAMOTO, AND MATTIAS JONSSON

On the one hand, by [Pau04, Theorem 1] (or [Zha96, Theorem 1.6, Theorem 3.6]) we have

E(φσ) =

1

deg R

log (cid:107)σ · R(cid:107) + O(1).

(4.5)

On the other hand, choosing any norm on the space of complex N × N -matrices (in which
G of course embeds), it is observed in the proof of [Tia14, Lemma 3.2] that

(cid:90)

(φσ − φref ) MA(φref ) = log (cid:107)σ(cid:107) + O(1).

The assertion for J(φσ) follows.

X

(cid:3)

4.3. Discussion of [Tia14]. The statement of [Tia14, Lemma 3.1] sounds overoptimistic
from the GIT point of view, as it would mean that CM-stability can be tested by only
considering 1-parameter subgroups of a ﬁxed maximal torus T .
At least, the proof is incorrect, the problem being the estimate (3.1), which claims that
φτ k − φτ is uniformly bounded with respect to τ ∈ T and k ∈ K. As the next example
shows, this is not even true for a ﬁxed k ∈ K.
Example 4.6. Assume (s1, s2) is a basis of H 0(X, L), let k ∈ U (2) be the unitary transfor-
mation exchanging s1 and s2, τ = (t, t−1), and pick a point x with s1(x) = 0. Then

φτ k(x) − φτ (x) = 4 log |τ|

is unbounded.

In any case, the methods here do not seem to be able to deduce CM-stability from K-

stability, because of the following fact.

Proposition 4.7. For each polarized manifold (X, L) and each m large and divisible enough,
there exists a non-trivial 1-PS λ in GL(Nm, C) such that J and M remain bounded on the
corresponding Fubini-Study ray φs := φλ(e−s).

Proof. As originally observed in [LX14] (cf. Proposition 2.3), (X, L) admits a non-trivial
ample test conﬁguration (X ,L) that is almost trivial, i.e. with trivial normalization. As
recalled in §2.2, for each m large and divisible enough, (X ,L) can be realized as the test
conﬁguration induced by a 1-PS λ : C∗ → GL(Nm, C), which is non-trivial since (X ,L) is.
Since the normalization of (X ,L) is trivial, the associated non-Archimedean metric is of the
form φtriv + c for some c ∈ Q, and hence M NA(φλ) = J NA(φλ) = 0. Since M and J have
log norm singularities on GL(Nm, C) by Theorem 4.5, M and J are indeed bounded on φs
(cid:3)
by Theorem 4.4.

5. Remarks on the Yau-Tian-Donaldson conjecture

As explained in the introduction, we will here give a simple argument, following ideas
of Tian, for the existence of a K¨ahler-Einstein metric on a Fano manifold X, assuming
(X,−KX ) is uniformly K-stable and the partial C0-estimates due to Sz´ekelyhidi.

UNIFORM K-STABILITY AND ASYMPTOTICS OF ENERGY FUNCTIONALS

23

5.1. Partial C0-estimates and the continuity method. For the moment, consider an
arbitrary polarized manifold (X, L). For each m such that mL is very ample, we have a
‘Bergman kernel approximation’ map Pm : H → Hm, deﬁned by setting Pm(φ) to be the
Fubini-Study metric induced by the L2-scalar product on H 0(X, mL) deﬁned by mφ.
Deﬁnition 5.1. A subset A ⊂ H satisﬁes partial C0-estimates at level m if there exists
C > 0 such that |Pm(φ) − φ| ≤ C for all φ ∈ A.

Now assume X is Fano, and set L := −KX . Given a K¨ahler form α ∈ c1(X), consider

Ric(ωt) = tωt + (1 − t)α.

Aubin’s continuity method
(5.1)
It is well-known that there exists a unique maximal solution (ωt)t∈[0,T ), where 0 < T ≤ 1.
The following important result, due to Sz´ekelyhidi [Sz´e13], conﬁrms a conjecture of Tian.
Theorem 5.2. The set A := {ωt | t ∈ [0, T )} satisﬁes partial C0-estimates at level m, for
arbitrarily large positive integers m.

Given this result, we shall prove

Theorem 5.3. Any uniformly K-stable Fano manifold admits a K¨ahler-Einstein metric.

By working (much) harder, Datar and Sz´ekelyhidi [DSz15] have in fact been able to deduce
from Theorem 5.2 a much better result dealing with K-polystability and allowing a compact
group action.

5.2. CM-stability and partial C0-estimates. We ﬁrst present in some detail well-known
ideas due to Tian [Tia12, §4.3]. In this section, (X, L) is an arbitrary polarized manifold.
Proposition 5.4. Assume that (X, mL) is CM-stable, and that A ⊂ H satisﬁes partial
C0-estimates at level m. Then there exist δ, C > 0 such that M ≥ δJ − C on A.

The proof is based on two lemmas.

Lemma 5.5. For any two metrics φ, ψ ∈ H, we have

(i) |J(φ) − J(ψ)| ≤ 2 sup(φ − ψ);
(ii) M (φ) ≥ M (ψ) − C sup|φ − ψ| for some C > 0 only depending on a one-sided bound

(either upper or lower) for the Ricci curvature of the K¨ahler metric ddcψ.

Proof. Recall that

E(φ) − E(ψ) =

1

n + 1

X

V −1

(φ − ψ)(ddcφ)j ∧ (ddcψ)n−j.

n−1(cid:88)

(cid:90)

j=0

X

As a consequence, |E(φ) − E(ψ)| ≤ sup|φ − ψ|, and (i) follows immediately.

For (ii), we basically argue as in the proof of [Tia14, Lemma 3.1]. By the Chen-Tian

formula (1.11), we have

M (φ) − M (ψ) = Hψ(φ) + ¯S (E(φ) − E(ψ)) + ERic(ddcψ)(ψ) − ERic(ddcψ)(φ).

Here the entropy term Hψ(φ) is non-negative, and we have

ERic(ddcψ)(φ) − ERic(ddcψ)(ψ) =

V −1

(φ − ψ)(ddcφ)j ∧ (ddcψ)n−j−1 ∧ Ric(ddcψ).

24

S´EBASTIEN BOUCKSOM, TOMOYUKI HISAMOTO, AND MATTIAS JONSSON

Assume Ric(ddcψ) ≤ Cddcψ for some constant C > 0. We may then write

(ddcφ)j ∧ (ddcψ)n−j−1 ∧ Ric(ddcψ)

= C(ddcφ)j ∧ (ddcψ)n−j − (ddcφ)j ∧ (ddcψ)n−j−1 ∧ (C(cid:48)ddcψ − Ric(ddcψ)),
a diﬀerence of two positive measures of mass CV and CV + (Ln−1 · KX ), respectively, and
the desired estimate follows.
The case where Ric(ddcψ) ≥ −C(cid:48)ddcψ is treated similarly (and will anyway not be used
(cid:3)

in what follows).

We next recall a well-known upper bound for the Ricci curvature of restrictions of Fubini-

Study metrics.
Lemma 5.6. We have Ric(ddcφ) ≤ Nmddcφ for all φ ∈ Hm.
Proof. Choose a basis of H 0(X, mL), and let ω be the corresponding Fubini-Study metric
on P := PH 0(X, mL)∗. Its curvature tensor

Θ(TP, ω) ∈ C∞(P, Λ1,1T ∗

P ⊗ End(TP))

is Griﬃths positive and satisﬁes

TrTP Θ(TP, ω) = Ric(ω) = Nmω.

For each complex submanifold Y ⊂ P, the curvature of its tangent bundle TY with
respect to ω|Y satisﬁes Θ(TY , ω|Y ) ≤ Θ(TP, ω)|TY as (1, 1)-forms on Y with values in the
endomorphisms of TY , as a consequence of a well-known curvature monotonicity property
going back to Griﬃths. We thus have

Ric(ω|Y ) = TrTY Θ(TY , ω|Y ) ≤ TrTY Θ(TP, ω)|TY .

Using now Θ(TP, ω) ≥ 0, we have on the other hand

TrTY Θ(TP, ω)|TY ≤ TrTP Θ(TP, ω)|Y = Nmω|Y ,

and hence

Ric(ω|Y ) ≤ Nmω|Y .

Applying this to the images of X ⊂ P under projective transformations yields the desired
(cid:3)
result.

Proof of Proposition 5.4. Since (X, mL) is CM-stable, there exist δ, C > 0 such that

M (Pm(φ)) ≥ δJ(Pm(φ)) − C

(5.2)
for all φ ∈ H. By assumption on A, we also have |Pm(φ) − φ| ≤ C for all φ ∈ A, and by
Lemma 5.6, the Ricci curvature of ddcPm(φ) is uniformly bounded above. Hence Lemma 5.5
shows, as desired, that there exists C(cid:48) > 0 with M (φ) ≥ δJ(φ) − C(cid:48) for all φ ∈ A.

5.3. Proof of Theorem 5.3. Assume now that X is a Fano manifold and set L := −KX .
Consider the continuity method (5.1). Pick metrics ψ and φt on −KX such that α = ddcψ
and ωt = ddcφt, respectively. After adding a constant to φt, (5.1) may be written

(ddcφt)n = e−2(tφt+(1−t)ψ).

(5.3)

We recall the proof of the following well-known monotonicity property.
Lemma 5.7. The function t → M (φt) is non-increasing.
Proof. We have

Since Ric(ωt) ≥ tωt, the ¯∂-Laplacian ∆(cid:48)(cid:48)

X = −KX , with curvature ddcψt = Ric(ωt).

(cid:3)
We may now complete the proof of Theorem 5.3. By Corollary E, (X,−mKX ) is CM-
stable for all m divisible enough. Theorem 5.2 and Proposition 5.4 therefore yield δ, C > 0
such that M (φt) ≥ δJ(φt) − C along Aubin’s continuity method. Since M (φt) is bounded
above by Lemma 5.7, it follows that J(φt) remains bounded. By [Tia, Lemma 6.19], the
oscillation of φt is bounded, and well-known arguments allow us to conclude, see [Tia, §6.2].

with ∆(cid:48)(cid:48)
(5.3) yields
