ABSTRACT

OJ 287 is a quasi-periodic quasar with roughly 12 year optical cycles. It displays prominent
outbursts which are predictable in a binary black hole model. The model predicted a major
optical outburst in December 2015. We found that the outburst did occur within the expected
time range, peaking on 2015 December 5 at magnitude 12.9 in the optical R-band. Based on
Swift/XRT satellite measurements and optical polarization data, we ﬁnd that it included a major
thermal component. Its timing provides an accurate estimate for the spin of the primary black
hole, χ = 0.313 ± 0.01. The present outburst also conﬁrms the established general relativistic
properties of the system such as the loss of orbital energy to gravitational radiation at the 2%
accuracy level and it opens up the possibility of testing the black hole no-hair theorem with a
10% accuracy during the present decade.

Its light curve

The prediction for the 2015/6 observing season
was that OJ 287 should have a major optical out-
burst in December 2015, brightest optical level in
30 years (see Figure 1 in Valtonen et al. 2011a
for the future light curve), coinciding with the
centenary of General Relativity. The exact timing
of the optical outburst may be used to test predic-
tions of the general relativistic binary black hole
model (Valtonen & Lehto 1997; Valtonen et al.
2010b).

The quasi-periodic pattern of optical outbursts
of OJ 287 was explained in 1995 by a model
where a secondary black hole in a 12 year or-
bit impacts the accretion disk of the primary
black hole at regular intervals (Lehto & Valtonen
1996; Sundelius et al. 1997). Owing to the quasi-
Keplerian nature of binary black hole orbits in
general relativity, the impacts and their associated
electromagnetic radiation events cannot occur in a
strictly periodic manner (Damour & Sch¨afer 1988;
Memmesheimer et al. 2004). Attempts to use
purely Newtonian orbit models,
ignoring post-
Newtonian corrections, have failed (Valtonen & Sillanp¨a¨a
2011; Valtonen & Ciprini 2012). 1

However, it is indeed possible to ﬁnd a unique
mathematical description for the orbit in the post-
Newtonian approximation to general relativity,
provided a long enough record of past radiation
outbursts is available. The solution is sensitive
to the loss in gravitational binding energy caused
by gravitational wave emission and the Lense-
Thirring eﬀect that forces the binary black hole
orbital plane to precess, mainly due to the spin
of the primary black hole (Barker & O’Connell
1975; Damour & Sch¨afer 1988).

An essential feature of the model is that the
impact outbursts are generated by expanding
bubbles of hot gas which have been shocked
and pulled out of the accretion disk (see Figure
1). The process is astrophysically rather sim-
ple (Lehto & Valtonen 1996; Ivanov et al. 1998;
Pihajoki 2016) and the resulting radiation em-
anates from the vicinity of the impact site. Thus,
these thermal radiation events are excellent mark-
ers for tracing the orbital motion of the secondary
around the primary black hole. In contrast, the

shocks in jets which also arise as a consequence of
the inﬂuence of the secondary have a complicated
route from cause to eﬀect. These ”tidal” out-
bursts (Sillanp¨a¨a et al.
1988; Sundelius et al.
1997; Valtonen et al. 2009, 2011) are also pre-
dictable in the binary model, but cannot be used
to construct the orbit as accurately as by using
the record of the thermal events.
In other sys-
tems the regularly repeated events in a jet may
be a more likely alternative than thermal events
(Ackermann et al. 2015).

Fig. 1.— The orbit of the secondary black hole in
OJ 287 from year 2000 to 2023. The present ther-
mal outburst comes from the disk crossing in 2013
while the nonthermal ﬂux arises from a jet, paral-
lel to the primary spin axis. The next two thermal
outbursts are due in 2019 and 2022, following the
crossing of the secondary black hole through the
accretion disk of the primary black hole.

2. OBSERVATIONS

In anticipation of the predicted outburst, we
organized a multisite optical observing campaign
aimed at getting photometric and polarimetric
data on OJ 287. Both professional astronomical
observatories and amateur observers took part in
obtaining photometric data from the very begin-
ning of the 2015/2016 season. The telescopes of
amateur astronomers are in the 0.20−0.30 m class
(Valtonen et al. 2008a).

Photometric observations were carried out by
the following observatories: Tuorla Observatory in
Finland, Mount Suhora Observatory of the Peda-
gogical University and Astronomical Observatory

Schmidt telescopes of the University Observa-
tory Jena, Germany (Mugrauer & Berthold 2010;
Mugrauer 2016), the 0.77 m Schmidt Camera of
Tonantzintla in Mexico, the 0.60 m and 1.22 m re-
ﬂectors of the Canakkale Onsekiz Mart University
Observatory, the 0.60 m telescope of the Univer-
sity of Adiyaman and the 0.60 m telescope at the
TUBITAK National Observatory, Turkey and the
0.50 m robotic telescope at the Ondrejov Obser-

vatory, Czech Republic. In the continental US the
photometric data were gathered with the 0.9 m
SARA telescope at Kitt Peak, the 0.40 m telescope
of Florida International University, the 0.76 m
Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT)
at the Lick Observatory (Filippenko et al. 2001),
the 0.40 m University of Alabama campus tele-
scope and the 0.40 m Arizona State University
campus telescope. OJ 287 was measured through
the wide band R ﬁlter in most sites. Only the
KAIT data were taken without any ﬁlter and
transformed into the R band. We performed dif-
ferential photometry on images calibrated for bias,
dark and ﬂatﬁeld with the aperture method. We
used GSC 1400-222 (R = 13.74 mag) as the com-
parison star and GSC 1400-444 as the check star.
Measurements with the DIPOL-2 polarimeter
(Piirola et al.
2014) installed on the remotely

of polarization if the excess nonthermal compo-

larization. Nightly median values are plotted for

dates are used throughout this paper). Simultane-
ous observations in three diﬀerent passbands (B,
V , R) were made by using dichroic beam splitters
to divide the light, which was then recorded by
three CCDs. On each night, 32 × 30 s exposures
of OJ 287 were obtained at diﬀerent orientations
(22.5◦ steps) of the superachromatic half-wave re-
tarder used as the polarization modulator. The
ﬂuxes of the target images on the CCD frames
were extracted by using a circular aperture of 4′′–
6′′ radius.

Polarization and photometry observations of
OJ 287 were taken on 20 nights (89 altogether) in
the interval 2015 November 28 to 2015 December
31 with the RINGO3 polarimeter (Arnold et al.
2012) on the fully robotic and autonomous Liv-
erpool Telescope on La Palma, Canary Islands
(Steele et al. 2010). Simultaneous observations
(120 s duration) in three passbands (blue, 3500–
6400 ˚A; green, 6500–7600 ˚A; and red, 7700–
10000 ˚A) were taken using the rapidly rotating
(once per 4 seconds) polaroid which modulates
the incoming beam of light in 8 rotor positions,
and for the photometry the 8 frames are stacked.
The beam is simultaneously split by 2 dichroic
mirrors into three low-noise electron multiplying

CCD cameras. The ﬂuxes of the OJ 287 images on
the EMCCD frames were extracted using circular
apertures with radii of 4′′. By combining the ﬂux
from the 8 rotor positions using equations from
Clarke & Neumayer (2002) the linear Stokes pa-
rameters were measured and used to calculate the
degree and angle of polarization. The data were
corrected for the eﬀects of instrumental polariza-
tion and depolarization by observation of standard
stars from Schmidt et al. (1992).

The polarimetric observations at the 2.5 m
NOT telescope (Principal
Investigator K.N.)
were carried out in the manner described in
Valtonen et al. (2009). Polarization observations
with the 0.60 m Cassegrain telescope at Mount
Suhora Observatory were carried out during 7
nights using four polarimetric ﬁlters transmitting
light of the polarization planes 0◦, 45◦, 90◦, and
135◦. At least 7 full series of measurements in
all four ﬁlters were performed each night with ex-
posure times between 30 s and 90 s, depending
on weather conditions and brightness of the tar-
get. Fluxes were extracted by using the IRAF
”apphot” package. Finally, the degree of polar-
ization and position angles were obtained by the
n-polarizers method proposed by Sparks & Axon
(1999).

Two polarimetric observations were obtained
using the ARIES Imaging Polarimeter (AIMPOL;
Rautela et al.
2004), mounted on the 1.04 m
Sampurnanand Telescope (Sinvhal et al. 1975) at
Nainital, India, coupled with a TK 1024 × 1024
pixels CCD camera.

A time-domain program for the Swift satel-
lite dedicated to OJ 287 was performed (Princi-
pal Investigator S.C.) in parallel to these optical
multisite observations, using Swift /UVOT ﬁlters
UVW1, UVM2 and UVW2 and Swift/XRT (0.3–
10 keV band). Here we report primarily the re-
sults from the ground-based optical telescope R-
band and Swift /UVOT UVW2 band where the
results were more complete than in other chan-
nels, in addition to X-rays. Swift /XRT data were
taken in photon-counting mode for a total expo-
sure of about 20 ksec divided into daily observa-
tions. Each single X-ray spectrum (0.3–10 keV)
can be ﬁt by an absorbed single (or broken) power-
law model, with an H I column density consistent
with the Galactic one in the direction of the source
(nH = 2.56 × 1020 cm−2, Kalberla et al. 2005).

ray observations by Swift /XRT in the 0.3–2 keV
energy band in ergs cm−2 s−1 (squares with er-
rorbars) with the excess (”jet”) emission above
the line of Figure 2 (dashed line). Top panel:
Swift /UVOT observations in the ultraviolet (UV)
UVW2 band (central wavelength 1928 ˚A) shown
as squares with errorbars. The model line shown
in Figure 2 has been shifted to the UVW2 band
by using the spectral index of 1.35.

The X-ray spectra have photon indexes between
about 1.4 and 1.9. The preliminary corresponding
unabsorbed (0.3–2.0 keV) integral daily ﬂuxes are
reported here, together with simultaneous dered-
dened UVOT ﬂux-density values obtained with
the 3 UV ﬁlters.

After starting intensive optical ground-based
photometric monitoring of OJ 287 in September
2015, a series of frames (about 10 images per
night) were taken to measure the brightness of the
target every clear night. Nightly means were cal-
culated and posted on the campaign’s web page.
After November 14, a steady rise of the object ﬂux
was noticed, and by November 25 it was appar-
ent that it may develop into a major outburst, in
the category observed only twice in 12 yr. We ex-
tended our observations by making them as long as
possible each night, measuring also colors at some
sites. The source kept brightening very rapidly
until it was brightest it has been in 30 yr. After
the December 5 maximum the source declined in
stages, until it arrived at its pre-outburst level on
December 30 (see Figure 2).

The major outbursts in OJ 287 are recognized
by a rapid rise to a narrow peak and then a slower
decline with multiple smaller ﬂares. The gen-
eral shape of the curve in Figure 2 is based on a
model of a uniform expanding sphere of plasma
(Pihajoki 2016). However, as seen generally in
observations e.g.
in 1983 (Smith et al. 1987),
there is an initial, slowly rising part in the light
curve with an additional peak at the maximum.
This “standard light curve” (Valtonen et al.
2011a) is used here even though detailed theo-
retical models do not exist.

The information on the nature of radiation at
diﬀerent stages of the outburst has been limited
up to now. In 2007 a good coverage of the out-
burst was achieved in polarization; it showed that
the major component of the outburst was unpo-
larized, superposed on a lower level of polarized
synchrotron emission (Valtonen et al. 2008b). In
1983 the degree of polarization decreased close
to zero at the high point of the light curve
(Smith et al. 1987). Therefore we have reasons
to believe that an underlying unpolarized compo-
nent, like the curve in Figure 2, also exists in the
2015 outburst, in addition to the usual polarized
ﬂares.

Figure 3 shows the evolution of the degree of po-

6

larization at diﬀerent stages of the 2015 outburst.
We superpose on the data the expected degree of
polarization, by using the theoretical line in Figure
2 to separate the thermal and nonthermal compo-
nents of the outburst. The solid line gives the ratio
of the excess radiation above the theoretical line to
the total ﬂux, multiplied by 40. This is what one
might expect if the radiation below the theoreti-
cal line is unpolarized, as thermal bremsstrahlung
should be, and superposed on it we have syn-
chrotron ﬂares with 40% polarization. The sec-
ond line assumes an additional 10% contribution
to the degree of polarization from the base level
ﬂux. This simple concept seems to work reason-
ably well. If our separation of the bremsstrahlung
from synchrotron ﬂares in the model is correct,
then the X-ray emission, coming entirely from the
jet, should follow the optical excess emission. The
optical excess emission is deﬁned as the total opti-
cal ﬂux minus the bremsstrahlung ﬂux, the latter
separated from the total ﬂux according to the line
in Figure 2.

Figure 4 shows that this is indeed the case. The
X-ray ﬂare is rather modest, much smaller than
the optical outburst overall, but correlates very
well with the excess ﬂare emissions. The ﬂares
arising at this time are not diﬀerent from ﬂares ob-
served during the campaigns of the previous twelve
months (Edelson et al. 2015). There the X-ray
ﬂux was (4.0 ± 1) × 10−12 ergs cm−2 s−1, while
during our campaign it has been (4.4 ± 1) × 10−12
ergs cm−2 sec−1, only slightly enhanced.

The UV emission has followed the optical emis-
sion rather well in previous campaigns, using a
spectral index of 1.35 between the two wavelength
ranges (based on data from the Edelson et al.
2015 campaign) of Swift /UVOT. The ﬁgure shows
that the new line in the UVW2 channel follows
the data rather well. Above the thermal compo-
nents there are the same nonthermal ﬂares that
are seen in optical. The Swift UVW1 and UVM2
band results are entirely consistent with Figure 4.
A more careful study is required to determine the
temperature of the bremsstrahlung component at
this time (Valtonen et al. 2012b).

3. DISCUSSION

The timing signals are extracted from the opti-
cal light curve by identifying the start of the out-

burst. From Figure 2 it appears that the outburst
began on JD 2,457,342.5±2.5 which corresponds
to year 2015.874 ± 0.007. Using the previously cal-
culated correlation with the spin (Valtonen et al.
2011a), we get for the Kerr parameter of the pri-
mary black hole χ = 0.313 ± 0.01 (2 σ). We
have checked with orbit solutions, making use of
this new timing, that the possible χ values range
between 0.304 and 0.322. This is a considerable
improvement with respect to the previous value
χ = 0.28 ± 0.08 (Valtonen et al. 2010a).

For a comparison with black hole spin determi-

nations by X-ray spectroscopy, see Reynolds & Fabian
(2008) and Reynolds (2014). These are based on
determining the innermost stable orbit of the ac-
cretion disks in Seyfert nuclei or low-redshift qua-
sistellar objects (QSOs) in the radio-quiet realm,
or in X-ray binaries. Some of the spins are com-
parable to the spin of OJ 287, others are close to
the maximal value of unity, while the recently ob-
served merger of two black holes produced a spin
value of 0.67 (Abbott et al. 2016). In contrast to
the X-ray spectroscopy method, in this blazar we
are not dependent on understanding the physics
of accretion disks close to the innermost stable
orbit; in this sense the orbital torque method is
complementary to X-ray spectroscopy.

The present outburst timing ﬁrmly conﬁrms the
correctness of the binary black hole central en-
gine model for OJ 287 within its speciﬁed param-
eter ranges, namely primary mass (1.83 ± 0.01) ×
1010 M⊙, secondary mass (1.5 ± 0.1) × 108 M⊙
and orbital eccentricity (as deﬁned by using the
apocentre/pericentre ratio) 0.700 ± 0.001.

The present χ estimate opens up the possibility
of measuring the dimensionless quadrupole mo-
ment of the primary black hole (q2) at the 10%
level during the next thermal outburst, predicted
to happen in July 2019 (see Figure 1). This should
allow one to test the black hole no-hair theorem
by verifying the relation q2 = −χ2 at that level
(Carter 1970; Thorne & Hartle 1985). However,
observing the predicted July 2019 thermal out-
burst from the Earth will be diﬃcult owing to the
proximity of OJ 287 to the Sun at that time.

Additionally, as demonstrated earlier (Valtonen et al.

2010b, 2011a), the occurrence of the outburst
within the expected time window conﬁrms the
loss of energy by gravitational radiation within
2% of the prediction by general relativity and is

7

consistent with the no-hair theorem of black holes
within an accuracy of 30%. The energy loss from
impacts on the accretion disk is four orders of
magnitude smaller than the energy loss through
gravitational radiation and thus plays no role in
the binary model.

Finally we note that an exceptionally large
amount of gas has been pulled away from the pri-
mary disk during this impact which occurred close
to the apocentre of the binary orbit (Pihajoki et al.
(2013), see Figure 1). This gas is expected to feed
the two black holes for some time to come, and
keep OJ 287 active with ﬂares.

The highly polarized (39% polarization) ﬂare
near JD 2,457,380 is interesting; its degree of po-
larization is the highest ever measured in OJ 287.
The previous record was 36% polarization mea-
sured in the secondary peak of the 1984 major
event (Smith et al. 1987). This suggests that the
secondary ﬂare is closely connected with the ﬁrst,
unpolarized outburst. One possibility is the ac-
tivation of the jet of the secondary black hole at
these times. The secondary black hole is in the
vicinity of the expanding cloud of plasma and will
deﬁnitely accrete a major part of it — that is, the
part which is expanding to its direction.
It will
be interesting to search for other evidence to asso-
ciate the secondary ﬂare with the secondary black
hole.

In summary, we have shown that the outburst
in OJ 287 in November–December 2015 agrees
with the binary black hole model, both with regard
to the timing and the expected brightness as well
as a major outburst component being thermal.
The fact that such thermal outbursts are excel-
lent trackers of the secondary black hole orbit al-
lowed us to estimate the spin value of the primary
more narrowly than before, χ = 0.313 ± 0.01. This
November–December outburst ﬁrmly conﬁrms the
presence of an inspiraling massive black hole bi-
nary in OJ 287. It therefore makes a ﬁtting contri-
bution to general relativity centenary celebrations
of 2015/2016, and adds to the excitement over the
ﬁrst direct observation of a transient gravitational-
wave signal (Abbott et al. 2016).
