ABSTRACT

High redshift star-forming galaxies are likely responsible for the reionization of the Universe, yet
direct detection of their escaping ionizing (Lyman continuum) photons has proven to be extremely
challenging.
In this study, we search for escaping Lyman continuum of the Cosmic Horseshoe, a
gravitationally lensed, star-forming galaxy at z=2.38 with a large magniﬁcation of ∼ 24. Transmission
at wavelengths of low ionization interstellar absorption lines in the rest-frame ultraviolet suggest a
patchy, partially transparent interstellar medium. This makes it an ideal candidate for direct detection
of the Lyman continuum. We obtained a 10-orbit Hubble near-UV image using the WFC3/UVIS
F275W ﬁlter that probes wavelengths just below the Lyman limit at the redshift of the Horseshoe in
an attempt to detect escaping Lyman continuum radiation. After fully accounting for the uncertainties
in the opacity of the intergalactic medium as well as accounting for the charge transfer ineﬃciency
in the WFC3 CCDs, we ﬁnd a 3σ upper-limit for the relative escape fraction of fesc,rel < 0.08. This
value is a factor of ﬁve lower than the value (0.4) predicted by the 40% transmission in the low-ion
absorption lines. We discuss the possible causes for this discrepancy and consider the implications for
future attempts at both direct Lyman continuum detection as well as indirect estimates of the escape
fraction.

INTRODUCTION

Star-forming galaxies are expected to be responsible for
the reionization of the intergalactic hydrogen at z > 7
(e.g., Robertson et al. 2015) and much of the ionizing
background at 3 < z < 7 (Nestor et al. 2013; Becker &
Bolton 2013; Becker et al. 2015). Therefore, there has
been much interest in quantifying the fraction of ioniz-
ing photons that escapes from star-forming galaxies (the
“escape fraction,” fesc).

Recent measurements of the UV luminosity functions
of galaxies (e.g. Oesch et al. 2013; Alavi et al. 2014;
Bouwens et al. 2015b; Atek et al. 2015) have shown that

galaxies can provide enough ionizing photons by z ∼ 6
if the luminosity function is extrapolated to luminosi-
ties beyond our current detection limits and if the es-
cape fraction is high (∼ 0.2 or more Bouwens et al. 2012;
Robertson et al. 2013, 2015; Bouwens et al. 2015a). How-
ever, the escape fraction is not well constrained, nor is the
mechanism allowing for leakage of ionizing (Lyman con-
tinuum, LyC) photons. Unfortunately direct detection of
the ionizing photons from galaxies at the epoch of reion-
ization or soon thereafter is not feasible due to the high
opacity of the intergalactic medium (IGM) at z (cid:38) 4 (Fan
et al. 2006; Prochaska et al. 2009). Hence, over the last
two decades, many attempts have been made to detect
escaping LyC from various types of star-forming galaxies
at z (cid:46) 4 (e.g. Leitherer et al. 1995; Steidel et al. 2001;
Grimes et al. 2007, 2009; Siana et al. 2007, 2010, 2015;
Cowie et al. 2009; Iwata et al. 2009; Bridge et al. 2010;
Vanzella et al. 2010; Boutsia et al. 2011; Nestor et al.
2011, 2013; Mostardi et al. 2013; Guaita et al. 2016).

At z < 2, despite higher IGM transmission and lower
foreground contamination rates, only 4 LyC emitters
have been identiﬁed (Leitet et al. 2011, 2013; Borthakur
et al. 2014; Izotov et al. 2016), with escape fractions
less than 4% in three of the galaxies and ∼ 8% in the
other. At 2 < z < 4, ground-based studies have yielded
many LyC-emitting candidates. However, after careful
re-examination of many of them with higher resolution
HST images, only three robust detections have been con-
ﬁrmed (Vanzella et al. 2012, 2015; de Barros et al. 2016;
Mostardi et al. 2015; Vanzella et al. 2016).

Due to the limited success in LyC direct detection,
many studies have tried to indirectly determine the es-
cape fraction (e.g. Heckman et al. 2011; Jones et al.
2013b; Borthakur et al. 2014; Alexandroﬀ et al. 2015;

Vasei et al.

Erb 2015) based on the assumption of a “picket fence”
model of the interstellar medium, where the foreground
absorbing gas is assumed to be patchy, where parts of the
galaxy are covered by opaque gas clouds and others are
not. Thus, fesc is not dictated by a single column den-
sity of foreground gas, but is instead equal to the fraction
of the galaxy not covered by opaque, neutral gas clouds.
In this scenario, the covering fraction can be estimated
using strong absorption lines from low ions (assumed to
be cospatial with neutral hydrogen), where the transmit-
ted UV continuum in the saturated core of an absorption
line (which would normally be zero for complete cover-
age) should give a good indication of the fraction of the
UV disk that is transparent and, thus, the LyC escape
fraction.

The majority of ionizing photons are emitted by O-
stars that are formed in dense molecular clouds. There-
fore, mechanisms to expose these stars must occur on
relatively short timescales (within O-star lifetimes, < 10
Myr). This might be achieved either by SNe feedback
(e.g. Dove et al. 2000; Fujita et al. 2003; Ma et al. 2015),
interactions with other galaxies (Gnedin et al. 2008), or
runaway massive stars (e.g., Conroy & Kratter 2012).
Although the details of the mechanisms by which LyC
photons can escape the host galaxy are not well estab-
lished, they can be distinguished on the basis of the mor-
phological distribution of the escaping LyC in spatially
resolved, directly-detected LyC emitters.

In this study we investigate the ionizing emission of
J1148+1930, the “Cosmic Horseshoe” (Belokurov et al.
2007). The Horseshoe is a star-forming galaxy at z =
2.38 gravitationally lensed into an almost complete Ein-
stein ring of 5(cid:48)(cid:48) radius by a massive galaxy at z = 0.44.
The magniﬁcation factor is 24± 2 (Dye et al. 2008). The
high resolution, rest-frame UV spectrum of the Horse-
shoe has multiple, resolved interstellar absorption lines
of low ions with depths of ∼ 60% of the continuum ﬂux
density (Quider et al. 2009). As will be discussed in Sec-
tion 5.2 and also in the Appendix, based upon these lines
the picket fence model for the Horseshoe implies a rather
high fesc.

Thus, the Horseshoe is an excellent candidate from
which to directly detect and study escaping LyC. In ad-
dition, its redshift is ideal for the study of LyC as the
Hubble Space Telescope WFC3/UVIS F275W ﬁlter only
has transmission at wavelengths just short of rest-frame
912˚A, allowing a direct measurement of LyC at wave-
lengths very close to the Lyman limit, where the IGM
opacity is at a minimum. Moreover its large magniﬁca-
tion provides a rare opportunity to study the Lyman con-
tinuum escape fraction with higher sensitivity and higher
spatial resolution, which may allow us to distinguish be-
tween several possible LyC leakage mechanisms.

In Section 2, we deﬁne our strategy to measure the
escape fraction. In Section 3, we present the data. In
section 4, we outline the method to overcome the de-
tector degradations and artifacts that limit our sensi-
tivity. Finally, in Section 5, we present the results and
discuss their importance for future investigations of es-
caping LyC.
Throughout the paper, we adopt a cosmology with
ΩM = 0.3, ΩΛ = 0.7 and H0 = 70 km s−1 Mpc−1. The
ﬂux densities are all in fν, i.e. are given in erg s−1 cm−2

Hz−1, and the magnitudes are in the AB system.

2. ESCAPE FRACTION DEFINITION

There are two widely used deﬁnitions of the escape
fraction. First is the absolute escape fraction, fesc,abs,
deﬁned as the fraction of emitted LyC photons that es-
capes into the IGM. This deﬁnition is convenient for the-
oretical models where one can translate star formation
rates into intrinsic LyC ﬂux, but diﬃcult to measure ob-
servationally. To overcome the uncertainties of using the
absolute escape fraction, Steidel et al. (2001) deﬁned the
relative escape fraction, fesc,rel, as the fraction of escap-
ing Lyman continuum photons divided by the fraction of
escaping photons at rest-frame 1500 ˚A:

fesc,rel =

(Fout/Fstel)LyC
(Fout/Fstel)1500

=

fesc,abs

10−0.4A1500

(1)

where Fout
is the ﬂux that escapes the host galaxy
into the IGM, thereby contributing to the ionizing back-
ground and Fstel is the total intrinsic ﬂux produced in
the galaxy. A1500 is the dust attenuation, in magnitudes,
at 1500˚A. For a Calzetti reddening law (Calzetti 1997)
we would have A1500 = 10.33E(B − V ). Rearranging the
equation gives the commonly used equation for relative
escape fraction (Siana et al. 2007):

fesc,rel =

(F1500/FLyC)stel
(F1500/FLyC)obs

× eτHI,IGM

(2)

where τHI,IGM is the optical depth of the Lyman line
and continuum absorption of the neutral
intergalac-
tic hydrogen along the line of sight (hereafter LoS),
(F1500/FLyC)stel is the intrinsic ﬂux decrement across the
Lyman break, and (F1500/FLyC)obs is the corresponding
observed ratio. Eq. 2 is useful as it does not require
knowledge of dust attenuation and the 1500 ˚A ﬂux den-
sity of high redshift galaxies can be easily measured.

In order to assess the escape fraction of a galaxy we
have to estimate those three values. The intrinsic ﬂux
ratio depends on age, star formation history, initial mass
function (IMF) and metallicity of the stellar populations.
In Siana et al. (2007, their Fig 1) this ratio is calculated
at both λrest = 700 ˚A and λrest = 900 ˚A for an instan-
taneous burst and continuous star formation, and using
stellar population synthesis models from both Bruzual &
Charlot (2003) and Leitherer et al. (1999).

Based on the characteristics of the Horseshoe, we as-
sumed continuous star formation which has been pro-
ceeding for the last 100 Myr (Quider et al. 2009). Based
on this continuous star formation history, and the fact
that the central wavelength of the F275W ﬁlter is at
λrest ∼ 800 ˚A we estimate the intrinsic ﬂux ratio to
be (F1500/FLyC)stel ∼ 7.
To estimate the average transmission of the IGM, we
ran a Monte Carlo simulation (see Siana et al. 2007, for
details) using the known distributions of Hi absorber col-
umn densities as a function of redshift (Janknecht et al.
2006; Rao et al. 2006; Ribaudo et al. 2011; O’Meara et al.
2013) as summarized in Table 2 of Alavi et al. (2014). We
simulate 1000 lines of sights (hereafter LoS) through the
IGM to z = 2.38. Each LoS gives the transmission as a
function of wavelength, from which we determine aver-
age transmission through the F275W ﬁlter as illustrated

servations, the dark current has become more important.
Hence, to minimize the number of readouts, the F275W
exposure times were half an orbit in duration (1404 s),
with a total of 20 exposures and total exposure time of
28080 s.

Fig. 1.— Left: The average transmission (from 1000 simulated LoS) of Lyman continuum photons through the IGM from galaxies at

histogram of the F275W ﬁlter transmission-weighted IGM transmission of the 1000 simulated LoS. The vertical dashed line shows the same

that only ∼20% of the LoS have transmission below 8%.
by the left panel of Fig. 1. The right panel of Fig. 1
shows the distribution of IGM transmission through the
F275W ﬁlter for all 1000 LoS, demonstrating signiﬁcant
variation. In fact, the mean value of exp(−τIGM ) = 0.4
is not a common value, as the distribution is bimodal.
This can be converted to the distribution of escape frac-
tion which will give the probability of each escape frac-
tion limit. Also Rudie et al. (2013), showed considering
the higher incidence of the absorbers in the circumgalac-
tic medium (CGM) can reduce the average transmission
of CGM +IGM by a factor of ∼ 10% compared to the
average transmission of only IGM, yet they still have a
higher mean transmission estimate.
With estimates of the intrinsic Lyman break am-
plitude, (F1500/FLyC)stel ∼ 7, and the mean IGM
transmission, exp(−τIGM ) = 0.4, we need only to
measure the ﬂux density ratio, (F1500/FLyC)obs, to
determine the relative escape fraction.

The UVIS CCDs suﬀer from signiﬁcant charge transfer
ineﬃciency (CTI) when both the background and the
targets are faint (MacKenty & Smith 2012). As there is
eﬀectively no sky background in F275W (∼ 0.35 e− per
pixel per half orbit exposure), the dark current (∼ 1.5
e− per pixel per half orbit exposure) dominates the total
background but is very low. In addition, the expected
LyC signal is very faint. Therefore, CTI is of particular
concern for these observations and we have to understand
its eﬀects on our measurements. In order to minimize the
number of pixels traversed by the electrons upon readout,
and therefore reduce the charge transfer ineﬃciency, we
intentionally placed the Horseshoe closer to the readout
edge of the detector, with its center ∼ 40% of the CCD
width from the read-out edge. In F606W, both the high
signal and high background minimize CTI, so it will not
signiﬁcantly aﬀect our measurements in that ﬁlter.

3. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION

3.1. Observations

For our analysis, we have used two images from the
Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3)
UV channel (UVIS). First, we used a one-orbit (2412 s)
image in the F606W ﬁlter from the Hubble Program ID
11602 to measure the non-ionizing UV ﬂux density at
λrest ∼ 1800 ˚A.
Because the rest-UV SED is nearly ﬂat in fν (g − i =
0.04 AB, Belokurov et al. 2007), we assume that the
ﬂux density at 1500 ˚A (typically used for escape fraction
measurements) is the same as the ﬂux density at 1800 ˚A.
We obtained a 10-orbit image in the F275W ﬁlter
to sample the rest-frame LyC, (transmission-weighted
wavelength of 2704 ˚A, or 800 ˚A in the rest frame of the
Horseshoe). Fig. 2 shows these ﬁlter transmission curves
with a typical Lyman break galaxy, LBG spectrum at
z = 2.38 and the smoothed spectrum of Quider et al.
(2009).

Below 4000 ˚A, read noise is the main source of noise in
our UVIS imaging, although, for more recent UVIS ob-

3.2. Data Reduction

Part of the WFC3/UVIS calibration process is the sub-
traction of a dark reference ﬁle to correct dark current
structure and ﬂag hot pixels that can cause signiﬁcant
artifacts in the images. The current standard processing
of the dark calibration is insuﬃcient for the WFC3/UVIS
data of this program due to the radiation damage caus-
ing poor charge transfer eﬃciency (CTE), and the low
background levels in the F275W ﬁlter. The STScI dark
frames have the following inadequacies: First, the STScI
process uses an outdated deﬁnition of a hot pixel that has
not been updated to account for CTE degradation, re-
sulting in unmasked warm-to-hot pixels remaining. Sec-
ond, the standard processing uses the median value of the
average darks as the value of all pixels in the dark frame.
This median dark ﬁle is not suitable for the low back-
ground of the NUV, because it leaves a low-level gradient
and a blotchy pattern in the dark that is not subtracted.
Lastly, the STScI darks are not corrected for CTE, fur-

z = 2.38. The blue line is the smoothed spectrum of the Horseshoe from Quider et al. (2009). The spectrum below the Lyman limit is
just an illustrative extrapolation assuming a constant fν corrected for the mean IGM transmission from z = 2.38 at each wavelength, i.e.
exp(−τIGM ). Also plotted are the total system throughput for the two WFC3/UVIS F275W and F606W ﬁlters, which sample, respectively,
the ionizing and non-ionizing UV continua.

thering the improper hot pixel masking, and contributing
to incorrect median levels in the STScI darks.

To solve these issues, custom CTE-corrected super-
darks are created in a two step process as detailed in
Rafelski et al. (2015). First, all darks from a 4 day win-
dow at the same cadence as the STScI darks are used
to create a superdark, where the background is modeled
with a third order polynomial to remove the background
gradient temporarily to ﬁnd the hot pixels with a uni-
form updated threshold level. This step is necessary due
to the large number of new hot pixels per day, and the
drastic change in hot pixels after each anneal, where the
CCD is warmed up for several hours to reduce the num-
ber of hot pixels caused by radiation damage. Then, all
darks from a single anneal cycle are averaged together
avoiding the hot pixels from each 4 day window, to de-
termine the actual dark level for each good pixel. This
averaged background is then used in conjunction with
the hot pixel map from the ﬁrst step to create a new
superdark which is used for calibrating the science ex-
posures. These new darks properly ﬂag the hot pixels,
remove the background gradient, and signiﬁcantly reduce
the blotchy pattern in the science exposures.

We ﬁrst CTE-corrected and dark subtracted all of the
ﬂat ﬁelded images. We then used the AstroDrizzle pack-
age (Gonzaga et al. 2012), provided by the Space Tele-
scope Science Institute, to combine the dithered images
into a ﬁnal image with a 0.04(cid:48)(cid:48) pixel scale. AstroDrizzle
outputs inverse variance maps which were used to de-
termine the expected Poisson uncertainties in each pixel.
The alignment of individual exposures was accurate to
< 4 mas in both ﬁlters. After combining all images, we
subtracted a slight, residual background gradient in the
read-out direction by ﬁtting a third-order polynomial to
both CCDs in order to guarantee a uniform background
around the Horseshoe.

The reduced images in both ﬁlters are shown in Fig. 3.
To determine the image depths, we corrected the pixel
rms for the adjacent pixel correlations based on Caser-
tano et al. (2000) (in our case, multiplied by 1.5) to esti-
mate sigma per pixel. The derived 5σ image depths in an
aperture with a 0.4(cid:48)(cid:48) radius are 27.34 and 26.79 AB mag-
nitude for the F606W and F275W images, respectively.

We note that this depth does not reﬂect the CTI that
will be discussed later and aﬀects the calculated upper
limit on fesc.

3.3. Photometry

We searched for F275W (LyC) ﬂux in a number of
apertures deﬁned by isophotes of varying F606W (non-
ionizing UV) surface brightness, because it is possible
that LyC is only escaping from certain regions (like those
of high star formation surface density, for example),. We
used three apertures with boundaries deﬁned by low (L),
medium (M), and high (H) surface brightness isophotes,
corresponding to 1.3σ, 3σ, and 5σ above the background
in F606W. These apertures constitute a range from a

ionizing ﬂux at λrest ∼ 1800 ˚A. Right: The 10-orbit F275W im-
age, with our largest aperture depicted in blue (the “L” aperture,

near-total ﬂux aperture up to a high surface brightness
aperture and are displayed in Fig. 4. No signal is detected
through the F275W ﬁlter in any of the apertures.The
F275W S/N in these apertures varies between -1.0 to
+1.1, and is therefore not a signiﬁcant detection.

We can use the depths of the F275W image to place
upper limits on the LyC escape fraction. However, ﬁrst,
we must assess the eﬀect (if any) of CTI as it may move
some of the expected ﬂux out of our aperture, erasing
some of the signal. Teplitz et al. (2013) has shown cases
where the signal can be lost completely in smaller aper-
tures. Unfortunately, at the time the data were taken
the “post ﬂash” option (Biretta & Baggett 2013) to add
background to the image was not available to mitigate
CTI, and pixel-based empirical corrections of CTI are
impossible in reconstructing images if no signal has re-
mained. Therefore, our images in the F275W ﬁlter will
be aﬀected by CTI.

4. METHOD TO ACCOUNT FOR CTI

As mentioned above, we do not detect a signiﬁcant LyC
signal in the F275W image. However, it is possible that
the depth of the image was signiﬁcantly aﬀected by CTI.
If that is the case, we can calculate the threshold ﬂux
above which we should have detected the signal from the
Horseshoe, including the eﬀects of CTI. To account for
CTI we should either be able to correct for it or simulate
its eﬀect on our assumed images. As the signal is essen-
tially lost in our LyC ﬁlter, there is not enough ﬂux to
make a correction feasible. Therefore, we must forward-
model the eﬀects of CTI, to determine a ﬂux threshold,
above which we would have detected the Horseshoe de-
spite CTI. For this analysis, we use the “CTE forward”
code released by STScI 9, which simulates the eﬀects of
CTI on a provided image.

4.1. Finding the detection limit

We ﬁrst make an “ideal” image in the F275W ﬁlter,
add the expected background, simulate the eﬀect of CTE,
and ﬁnally add the read-noise to produce an individual
F275W exposure. We then add them to produce a simu-
lated full-depth F275W image. Below we discuss details
of each of these steps.

4.1.1. Assumed image

Because we do not know the morphology of the escap-
ing LyC, we naively assume that the LyC has a similar
morphology to that of the non-ionizing UV continuum in
the F606W image. We then simply scale the ﬂux from
the F606W image down to simulate F275W images of
various ﬂuxes. Because the F606W and F275W images
were taken at diﬀerent orientation angles (relative to the
read-out directions), we also rotate the F606W image of
the Horseshoe and place it in the same location as the
expected position in the F275W image.

4.1.2. Background

The CTI is very sensitive to the background level.
Even a small background is eﬀective at partially occupy-
ing the electron traps, resulting in reduced CTI. There-
fore, it is imperative to carefully assess and add the back-
ground (sky + dark) electrons to our image before imple-
menting the CTI eﬀects. We calculate the dark current

9 http://www.stsci.edu/hst/wfc3/tools/cte tools

5
and sky backgrounds to be 1.53 e− pix−1 exposure−1 and
0.35 e− pix−1 exposure−1 respectively. Therefore, we as-
sume a background with a Poisson distribution with an
average of 1.88 e− pix−1 exposure−1.

4.1.3. Charge Transfer Phase and Read-noise

To simulate the eﬀect of CTE on our simulated im-
ages we ran the CTE-Forward code provide by STScI,
assuming various total LyC ﬂuxes. Afterward, the read
noise was added to each pixel as a random number with
a Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of 3.0,
consistent with the read noise for the four WFC3/UVIS
ampliﬁers. This results in a simulated image which is
a statistical representation of what would have been ob-
served by the CCD, albeit without accounting for cosmic
rays.

4.1.4. Stacking the images

We simulated 20 of these F275W images and stacked
them to obtain a full-depth stacked simulated image.
Now we are able to investigate whether, for an assumed
LyC ﬂux, the Horseshoe would be detected with 3σ con-
ﬁdence in our three diﬀerent apertures.

Of course, our “detection level” derived above is noisy,
because it relies only on a single simulated stacked im-
age, and the signal in this image will, by deﬁnition, vary
by the input standard deviation multiplied by the square
root of the number of pixels. Therefore, to more accu-
rately assess the expected detection threshold, we pro-
duce ﬁve instances of these simulated images at the same
LyC ﬂux level and use the average of their detection lev-
els. We had to using a higher S/N background, because
the Poisson variations in the background are large com-
pared to the background and such variations can aﬀect
the level of CTI in each pixel.

5. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

5.1. Observed Flux Ratios

We generated simulated images with eight diﬀerent in-
put magnitudes, spanning a range of two magnitudes
with steps of 0.25 magnitude (close to where we ex-
pect to have 3σ detection within our apertures). For
each of the stacked simulated images, after removing the
background, we measured the level of signal and noise
within each aperture. Fig. 6 shows the measured S/N
of each of the images in the three apertures, as a func-
tion of the input magnitude within that aperture. For
each of the input magnitudes, the average S/N is then
plotted as ﬁlled circles. To ﬁnd the input magnitude
that results in a 3σ detection, we ﬁt a curve to the
ﬁlled circles, assuming that input ﬂux is linearly pro-
portional to the detection level, and determine at what
magnitude the signiﬁcance of the detection would be
greater than S/N > 3. These threshold magnitudes and
the corresponding F606W magnitudes are listed in Ta-
ble 1. All magnitudes have been corrected for Galac-
tic extinction at the location of the Horseshoe based on
Schlaﬂy & Finkbeiner (2011) (AF 275W = 0.258 mags and
AF 606W = 0.117 mags).

For comparison, we have also listed in Table 1 the es-
cape fraction limits based solely on the background noise
and not considering signal loss due to CTI. Interestingly,
the limits are very similar, meaning that the CTI losses

are not large for our measurements. The CTI results in
0%, 5%, and 17% increase in the limiting ﬂux respec-
tively for L, M, and H apertures. Not surprisingly, the
CTI eﬀect on photometry is not signiﬁcant in the largest
apertures, as the typical trapped e− is released < 10
pixels behind the original pixel (Rafelski et al. 2015).
Therefore, CTI losses in the photometry only become a
concern when the aperture width (in the readout direc-
tion) approach this length scale.

5.2. Escape Fraction

With the F275W 3σ threshold magnitudes and the
F606W magnitudes in the corresponding apertures, we
can calculate the limits on the non-ionizing to ionizing
ﬂux ratio and, ultimately, the relative escape fraction,
using Eq. 2.
In Table 1, we list the 3σ limits on the
relative escape fraction in all three apertures.

After including the eﬀects of CTI, the upper limits on
the relative escape fraction in each aperture are simi-
lar: 0.079, 0.079, and 0.092 in the L, M and H aper-
tures, respectively, as the signiﬁcant reduction in F275W
noise in smaller apertures is oﬀset by reduced F606W
ﬂux. Using a Calzetti extinction curve (Calzetti 1997)
and E(B−V ) = 0.15 (Quider et al. 2009), we convert
fesc,rel < 0.08 to fesc,abs < 0.02, well below the av-
erage value needed to maintain ionization at z ∼ 7
(fesc,abs ∼ 0.2) (e.g., Robertson et al. 2015; Bouwens
et al. 2015a).

As mentioned in Section 1, the high resolution, rest-
frame UV spectrum of the Horseshoe has multiple,
resolved interstellar absorption lines of low ions with
depths of ∼ 60% of the continuum ﬂux density (Quider
et al. 2009). Some of these lines are shown in Fig. 7.
These lines have very diﬀerent oscillator strengths but
similar absorption depths, especially for the case of Si ii
transitions, which all originate from the same ion and the
relative depths are therefore independent of the metal-
licity or ionization. Quider et al. (2009) therefore con-
clude that the depth of the lines is not due to the col-
umn density of a foreground screen. Rather, the depth
is dictated by the fraction of the UV-bright disk that is
covered by clouds that are opaque in these lines. Hence
for the Horseshoe, we expect a ∼ 0.6 “covering fraction”
of low-ionization gas where neutral hydrogen would re-
side. Based on the picket fence model and the discussion
in the Appendix, this in turn implies fesc,rel ∼ 0.4.
The reported 3σ limits in our apertures of fesc,rel <
0.08 are roughly ﬁve times lower than the expected es-
cape fraction inferred from the depth of the low-ion ab-
sorption lines in the spectrum of the Horseshoe. One rea-
son for this discrepancy could be the existence of a rather
opaque IGM along the LoS to the Horseshoe. To ob-
tain our measured fesc,rel we adopt the average transmis-
−τHI,IGM =
sion of the IGM through the F275W ﬁlter (e
0.402). But, as is evident in Figure 1, this value is not
representative of the nearly bimodal distribution of the
IGM transmission. Speciﬁcally, there is an almost 20%
chance that the Horseshoe lies along a line of sight that
is at least 5× more opaque than the average transmission

assumed here (less than 0.08), which could thus explain
our non-detection, even if fesc,rel is 0.4 as suggested by
the depth of the low ionization interstellar absorption
lines. On the other hand, the IGM transmission could
also be signiﬁcantly higher than the average value, in
which case our fesc,rel limit would be even lower.

There are still a number of additional possible causes
for a discrepancy between the transmission in the low
ions and the relative escape fraction. Many of these rea-
sons have been mentioned by Jones et al. (2013b), but
we discuss them here in the context of the Horseshoe;

1. The absorption depths of the low-ions give only
a covering fraction of the non-ionizing UV disk (from
∼ 1250 − 1700 ˚A ). However, because the LyC-emitting
regions are short-lived, they likely comprise only a sub-
set of the area that is emitting non-ionizing UV light.
Therefore, a clear line of sight toward a non-ionizing
UV-emitting region does not necessarily imply that LyC
photons will escape. Furthermore, it is likely that the
LyC-emitting regions have higher columns of dust and
gas toward them, as they are younger and more embed-
ded in their birth clouds. Indeed, this is the reason that
extinction of H ii regions is typically higher than extinc-
tion of other regions at the same wavelengths (Calzetti
1997). Therefore, the transmitted emission in the low-
ion absorption lines should be considered an upper-limit
to the possible LyC escape fraction.

2. The LyC absorption by hydrogen acts at all wave-
lengths below the Lyman limit, whereas the absorption
lines absorb at one speciﬁc wavelength. Therefore, one
must be careful in interpreting the absorption lines. The
velocity structure of the absorbing gas is critical when
converting the depth of the absorption lines to covering
fractions. For example, if half of the galaxy is covered by
gas outﬂowing at 0-100 km s−1, and the other half is cov-
ered by gas outﬂowing at 100-200 km s−1, then the depth
of the absorption line (in a high-resolution spectrum) will
never be more than 50% of the continuum. However, the
LyC in such a scenario would be 100% absorbed because
it is insensitive to the velocity of the outﬂow. Thus, once
again, the LyC escape fraction should generally be lower
than expected given the absorption line depth.

3. If there are foreground neutral clumps with low ve-
locity dispersion that are not resolved in wavelength, the
proﬁle of the absorption line will be smoothed, and the
measured transmission will reﬂect only an upper limit on
fesc,rel.
In our case the Keck/Echellette Spectrograph

Fig. 7.— Three low ionization absorption line proﬁles from the
high resolution (R ∼ 4000) spectrum of the Horseshoe (Quider
et al. 2009). Though these ions have diﬀerent abundances, and
the transitions have diﬀerent oscillator strengths, the depth of each
feature is the same, ∼ 0.4 of the continuum ﬂux density, suggesting
a covering fraction of ∼ 0.6 for the low-ionization gas. As this low-
ionization gas is also where neutral hydrogen would reside, this
could imply that as much as 40% of the UV-bright disk may be
unobscured, allowing LyC photons to escape along those sight lines.

and Imager (ESI) spectra of the Horseshoe has the res-
olution of ∼ 75 km s−1. Though the velocity width of
the absorption proﬁles is much larger than this value, it
is still possible that there exists unresolved narrow com-
ponents.

4. These absorption lines are due to resonance transi-
tions from the ground state. Therefore, the photon can
be scattered and re-ﬁll the absorption line if the slit en-
compasses a large fraction of the scattering gas cloud
(Prochaska et al. 2011; Rubin et al. 2011; Scarlata &
Panagia 2015). Thus, the covering fraction may be larger
than implied by the depth of the absorption lines, and
the relative escape fraction will be lower.

5.

If the LyC absorbing gas is very low metallicity
(Fumagalli et al. 2011) perhaps because it is inﬂowing
from the IGM, then the metal line absorption will not
be strong, but the hydrogen opacity will still be large
and can absorb the LyC. Though, given the signiﬁcant
amount of enriched outlawing material, and the large
accumulated stellar mass, it seems unlikely that a sig-
niﬁcant fraction of the absorbing gas would be very low
metallicity. However, in such a scenario, the absorption
line transmission should be treated as an upper limit.

Because of the reasons outlined above, we believe a
non-uniform coverage of low-ionization metals is a nec-
essary, but not suﬃcient, condition for signiﬁcant escape
of Lyman continuum. Hence, any estimates of fesc,rel
based on these absorption lines should be interpreted as
upper-limits.

Although fesc,rel may be signiﬁcantly lower than pre-
dicted by the transmission in low-ion absorption lines, it
is worth noting that the two values will be better cor-
related in more compact galaxies because many of the
issues raised above that can cause the two to diﬀer are
mitigated signiﬁcantly if the galaxy is extremely com-
pact (< 100 pc). First, the ionizing and non-ionizing UV
continua are likely emitted from the same regions (a sin-
gle star-forming region). In contrast, in a large galaxy,
much of the non-ionizing ﬂux is likely emitted from re-
gions with no current star formation (and thus no LyC
production). Second, the smaller the galaxy, the likelier
it is that the absorption of light from diﬀerent parts of
the galaxy is caused by the same absorbers, especially if
the galaxy size approaches the typical size of an absorb-
ing neutral clump in the ISM or CGM. Thus, one has to
worry less about clumps of diﬀerent velocities covering
diﬀerent parts of the disk.

Indeed, Heckman et al. (2011); Borthakur et al. (2014);
Alexandroﬀ et al. (2015) have been investigating the rel-
ative escape fraction, both directly and indirectly from
luminous and extremely compact galaxies, which they
refer to as dominant central objects (DCOs, ionizing UV
sizes of < 100 pc). Thus, it may be true that the ab-
sorption line transmission reasonably predicts the rela-
tive escape fraction in these galaxies, but it may not be
the case in all galaxies.

The intrinsic size of the Cosmic Horseshoe galaxy has
been measured in both the non-ionizing UV and Hα by
Jones et al. (2013a). In both cases, the emission is com-
ing from an elongated region that is ∼ 0.2 kpc ×0.4 kpc,
signiﬁcantly smaller than the average UV size of galaxies
of similar luminosity which typically have diameters of
∼ 3 − 4 kpc (Law et al. 2007). With such a small area,

8

Vasei et al.

we might expect that some of the issues above would be
mitigated. However, this area is still large enough that
it likely consists of many distinct star-forming regions,
and may still be covered by a range of clump distribu-
tions along the LoS. To understand the eﬃcacy of these
indirect estimates of fesc,rel, we must directly image the
LyC of a large sample of galaxies with high transmission
in the low-ion absorption lines.

6. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

In this study, we have attempted to measure the Ly-
man continuum escape fraction of the Cosmic Horseshoe,
a highly magniﬁed, star-forming galaxy at z = 2.38. The
high resolution rest-frame ultraviolet spectrum of the
Horseshoe shows only ∼ 60% absorption in the resolved
interstellar absorption lines of low ions (e.g. Oi, Cii,
Siii), suggesting a patchy foreground neutral gas distri-
bution (Quider et al. 2009) and a relative escape fraction
of fesc,rel = 0.4. Given the high magniﬁcation, the well-
suited redshift for the existing WFC3/UVIS ﬁlters, and
the suggestion of a partially transparent foreground gas
distribution, we obtained a 10 orbit image of the Lyman
continuum (at ∼ 800˚A) with the WFC3/UVIS F275W
ﬁlter.

We made and subtracted enhanced darks that contain
the structure seen in the actual darks. We then forward
modeled the eﬀects of charge transfer ineﬃciency of the
WFC3/UVIS CCDs to determine at what ﬂux density
we would no longer be able to detect the LyC. Because
the photometric apertures are large (relative to unlensed
galaxies), we ﬁnd that the eﬀects of charge transfer in-

eﬃciency on our photometry are quite small (17% aﬀect
to the LyC photometry in the smallest [worst case] aper-
ture).

We do not detect signiﬁcant LyC ﬂux from the Cos-
mic Horseshoe, and the ﬂux density limit gives an upper
limit on the relative escape fraction of fesc,rel < 0.08
(3σ) when assuming average transmission through the
IGM. The upper limit is a factor of ﬁve lower than the
value suggested by the signiﬁcant transmission in the
low-ion interstellar absorption lines. This suggests that
the transmission in the interstellar absorption lines may
not be a reliable proxy for the relative escape fraction
(though cf. Borthakur et al. 2014). We outline a number
of reasons why the transmission in the absorption lines
of low ions may only give an upper limit to the escape
fraction. Finally, we note that there is a 20% chance that
the transmission of the IGM along the line of sight to the
Horseshoe may be ﬁve times lower than the assumed av-
erage, which would fully explain our non-detection even
if the relative escape fraction were 0.4. A study of a
much larger sample of star-forming galaxies can statis-
tically overcome the uncertain IGM transmission, and
would deﬁnitively test the indirect method of measur-
ing the escape fraction via the depths of the interstellar
absorption lines.

very signiﬁcant cultural role and reverence that the sum-
mit of Mauna Kea has always had within the indigenous
Hawaiian community. We are most fortunate to have the
opportunity to conduct observations from this mountain.

APPENDIX A: COVERING FRACTION TO ESCAPE FRACTION

APPENDIX

There are a number of deﬁnitions of the LyC escape fraction in the literature, “relative escape fraction”, “absolute
escape fraction”, “dust free escape fraction”, etc.. This has lead to some confusion about how they are related to
the physical covering fraction or the depth of the low-ionizing absorption lines. To avoid this confusion, we derive
here what exactly each of these terms represents for three simpliﬁed scenarios of dust distribution within a patchy
interstellar/circumgalactic medium. These simpliﬁed cases are a) a dust free model; b) a uniform screen of dust and c)
dust only located in dense clouds. Cartoons of these models are shown in Figure 8 where dusty regions are shown as
solid black dots. In all cases, the gas is assumed to be of suﬃcient column density to be optically thick in the common
low-ionization interstellar lines as well as the Lyman continuum. We note that the precise location of the uniform dust
screen in model (b) does not aﬀect the calculations below.

We also note that the covering fraction inferred by the depth of the absorption lines (denoted here by CF (cid:48)) is
not necessarily the same as the physical covering fraction of the dense clouds (CF ). Observationally, we can only
measure CF (cid:48) which is deﬁned as the ratio of the observed ﬂux density at the wavelength of the absorption line
(assumed to be completely saturated in the dense clouds), to the observed continuum ﬂux density (at around 1500˚A):
1 − CF (cid:48) = Fline,obs

F cont,obs . Therefore, we report our escape fractions as a function of CF (cid:48):

For the dust free case, the LyC ﬂux density and the ﬂux density in the absorption lines get completely absorbed by

the clouds while the 1500 ˚A continuum ﬂux density remains unaﬀected by the gas clouds:

Case (a) No dust :

FLyC,out = FLyC,stel × (1 − CF ); F1500,out = F1500,stel
1 − CF (cid:48) =
= 1 − CF

F1500,stel × (1 − CF )

So here CF = CF (cid:48), which results in:

fesc,rel =

(FLyC/F1500)out
(FLyC/F1500)stel

= 1 − CF = 1 − CF (cid:48)

fesc,abs =

FLyC,out
FLyC,stel

= 1 − CF = 1 − CF (cid:48)

(A4)

In this case, fesc,rel and fesc,abs are the same. In the literature, this is sometimes referred to as the dust free escape
fraction.

In this case we add a layer of uniform dust to the previous geometry. Now all of the ﬂux densities are the dust

attenuated ﬂux densities in case (a):

Case (b) Screening dust :

FLyC,out = FLyC,stel × (1 − CF ) × e−τdust,LyC ; F1500,out = F1500,stel × e−τdust,LyC

1 − CF (cid:48) =

Fline,obs
Fcont,obs

=

F1500,stel × (1 − CF )

F1500,stel

= 1 − CF

Again in this geometry we have CF = CF (cid:48), which results in:

(A5)

(A6)

(A7)

fesc,rel =

= 1 − CF (cid:48) × e−(τdust,LyC−τdust,1500)

(FLyC/F1500)out
(FLyC/F1500)stel
FLyC,out
FLyC,stel

(A8)
Here, neither fesc,rel nor fesc,abs are not equivalent to the 1 − CF (cid:48). We note that this is the geometry adopted by
Borthakur et al. (2014).

fesc,abs =

= 1 − CF (cid:48) × e−τdust,LyC

In this case the dust closely traces the dense gas. We believe that this is the model that most closely resembles
reality, as any signiﬁcant dust will be accompanied by opaque columns of gas (both in the LyC and the interstellar
absorption lines, Gnedin et al. 2008). Though the dust has practically no eﬀect on the line or LyC ﬂux (they get
absorbed predominantly by the gas), it attenuates the observed continuum ﬂux. So we have:

Case (c) Dust in clouds:

FLyC,out = FLyC,stel × (1 − CF ); F1500,out = F1500,stel × (1 − CF + CF × e−τdust,1500)

1 − CF (cid:48) =

Fline,obs
Fcont,obs

=

F1500,stel × (1 − CF )

F1500,stel × (1 − CF + CF × e−τdust,1500)

(cid:54)= 1 − CF

(A9)

(A10)

Interestingly, in such a scenario the covering fraction based on the depth of the low ionization absorption lines is
actually diﬀerent from the physical covering fraction, i.e. CF (cid:54)= CF (cid:48). As such we end up with the following relations
for the escape fractions:

fesc,rel =

(FLyC/F1500)out
(FLyC/F1500)stel

= 1 − CF (cid:48)

fesc,abs =

FLyC,out
FLyC,stel

= 1 − CF = 1 −

CF (cid:48)

CF (cid:48) + (1 − CF (cid:48)) × e−τdust,1500

(A11)

(A12)

Therefore, fesc,rel is, in fact, equal to the ratio of the observed ﬂux density in the line to the observed continuum
ﬂux density, fesc,rel = 1 − CF (cid:48). Since 1 − CF (cid:48) is a common observable, it is best to compare this measurement to that
of fesc,rel as we have done in this work.
