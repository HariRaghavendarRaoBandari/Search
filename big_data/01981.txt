We propose a class of kinematic variables, which is a smooth generalization of min-max type
mass variables such as the Cambridge-MT 2 and M2, for measuring a mass spectrum of intermediate
resonances in a semi-invisibly decaying pair production. While kinematic endpoints of min-max type
mass variables are only sensitive to a heavier resonance mass, kinematic endpoints of new variables
are sensitive to all masses. These new mass variables can be used to resolve a mass spectrum, so
that if the true mass spectrum is asymmetric, then the kinematic endpoints are separate while the
endpoints are the same for the symmetric true mass spectrum. We demonstrate the behavior of
kinematic endpoint of these new variables in pair production of two-body and three-body decays
with one invisible particle.

INTRODUCTION

Uncovering resonances hiding behind events with mul-
tiple invisible particles at a collider is essential for the
discovery of new physics. Events with missing energy are
typically favored in popular new physics scenarios with
dark matter candidates, such as the weak scale supersym-
metry [1, 2] and the extra-dimensional model [3]. These
new physics scenarios have conserved discrete symme-
tries, like R-parity and KK-parity, stabilizing the dark
matter and leaving, at least, a pair of invisible particles
in the new physics event. While the most straightforward
approach to discovering intermediate resonances is ﬁnd-
ing out Breit-Wigner resonance peaks in a reconstructed
invariant mass distribution, however, the resonance peak
cannot be reconstructed in such new physics events with
invisible particles.

Instead of reconstructing resonance peaks, kinematic
endpoints are often used to ﬁnd out the new resonances.
For semi-invisibly decaying pair productions, kinematic
endpoints of min-max type mass variables, such as the
Cambridge-MT 2 variable [4, 5] and M2 variable [6–8], are
well-known to provide relevant information for measur-
ing intermediate resonant particle masses. The min-max
type mass variables infer the momentum of invisible par-
ticles from a minimization of the maximum of two inter-
ested resonance masses over physical momenta conﬁgura-
tions consistent with transverse momentum conservation.
By construction, these mass variables are bounded above
by maximum of the true resonance masses [9]. The min-
max type mass variables can be useful especially if the
masses of the two resonant mother particles are identical,
i.e. symmetric, because kinematic endpoints of the mass
variables saturate this upper bound, and hence, we can
adapt the kinematic endpoints to reveal the true reso-
nance mass.

√

per bound only provide information on the heavier res-
onance mass [9] even though two resonances construct
the mass variables. Trying to be assumption indepen-
dent; indeed, the lighter resonance mass should also be
identiﬁed by kinematics. Second, the kinematic endpoint
often saturates the upper bound only when a consider-
able upstream momentum and a large total center-of-
ˆs of colliding partons are supplied [10, 11].
mass energy
Without such extreme kinematic conditions, the tail of
the distribution should be interpreted cautiously. There-
fore, special treatment is needed to study asymmetric
mass spectrum within a framework of min-max type mass
variables. Studies of generalized MT 2 with a hypothetical
ratio of parents masses [10] or subsystem MT 2 for gluino-
squark co-production [12] can be included as examples of
the non-trivial treatment.

In this regard, we introduce a broader class of mass
variables as a generalization of the min-max type mass
variables. Kinematic endpoints of these new variables
depend on both masses of intermediate resonances and
hence it can constrain two masses much more eﬃciently.
After then, we demonstrate kinematic endpoints be-
havior of these new variables in the case of a general
asymmetric mass spectrum.

II. MINIMIZED POWER MEANS

Consider N resonances with masses {mAi}i=1···N de-
scribed in FIG. 1 for N = 2. Since momenta of invisible
particles qi are unknown, we need a guess to construct
resonance masses {MAi}i=1···N . Trial resonance masses
are deﬁned by

However, kinematic endpoints of these min-max type
mass variables have foibles when the true mass spectrum
is asymmetric, i.e. non-identical masses. First, the up-

where pi is a sum of momenta of the visible particles from
the resonance Ai. This trial resonance mass is deﬁned
ambiguously when some visible particles from diﬀerent

FIG. 1. A typical pair production of two resonances A1 and
A2 having masses mA1 and mA2 decaying semi-invisibly in a
collider. pi is a sum of momenta of the visible particles from
the resonance Ai. qi is a momentum of the invisible parti-
cle from the resonance Ai. A system having semi-invisibly
decaying N resonances can be considered in a similar fashion.

resonances are reconstructed into the same type of ob-
jects. For example, in gluino pair production, all visible
particles are reconstructed into jets, and correctly as-
signing each jet to their mother resonance is not an easy
problem. In MT 2 analysis, to reduce a side eﬀect of this
combinatorial ambiguity, several methods are proposed
[13–17]. Solving the combinatorial ambiguity is not the
main focus of this paper, so we will assume that all the
visible particles are correctly assigned to correct mother
resonance.

Then, we need an objective function of the trial reso-
nance masses, to be minimized over the invisible degree
of freedoms in the event. As a smooth generalization of
the maximum function, which is the objective function
to be minimized in the min-max type mass variables, we
consider power means of two resonance masses. A power
mean with an exponent p of N arguments {xi}i=1···N is
deﬁned by

ˆµp(x1,··· , xN ) =

(xi)p

where a = 1, 2 denotes an index of transverse compo-
nent, qµ
i ( ˜m) is a trial momentum of the invisible particle
with a spatial momentum qi and a trial mass ˜m from
the resonance Ai, and /pa
T is a missing transverse momen-
tum. We note that µp,N is a function of trial masses ˜m
of invisible particles. Trying to be more general, we can
set the trial masses of each invisible particle diﬀerently
like MT 2’s case [10, 18, 19]. Nevertheless, we will focus
on invisible particles having identical masses, because the
typical dark matter motivated new physics scenarios pre-
fer various new particles decaying into the same type of
particle, which is the dark matter.

The minimized power mean µp,N is an increasing func-
tion of p like ˆµp in Eq. 2. For a given event, if p < q,
then the µp,N satisﬁes the following inequality,

µp,N ≤ µq,N .

(4)
At the invisible momentum solution for µq,N , ˆµp ≤ ˆµq =
µq,N because ˆµp is an increasing function of p. Since µp,N
is a minimum of ˆµp, µp,N ≤ ˆµp. Therefore, Eq. 4 holds.
Like the min-max type mass variables, µp,N has upper

and lower bounds from its method of construction.

µp,N (mχ) ≤ ˆµp(mA1,··· , mAN ) ,
µp,N ( ˜m) ≥ ˆµp (mp1 + ˜m,··· , mpN + ˜m) .

(5)
(6)

The upper bound is deﬁned in terms of the intermediate
resonance masses only when the test masses of invisible
particles are the correct invisible particle masses mχ. If
a kinematic endpoint of µp,N distribution reaches this
upper bound, i.e. saturated, than we can interpret the
kinematic endpoints into the true mass spectrum.
In
practice, saturation of events to the endpoint depends
on physics process and hence a survey is needed.

Now we focus on a pair production of semi-invisibly
decaying particles as FIG. 1, where N = 2, then µp,2 is
deﬁned as the following:

Then (MAi)p for p ≥ 2 is a convex function for invisible
momenta, and their sum 2ˆµp(MA1 , MA2 )p = (MA1)p +
(MA2)p is also a convex function. Therefore, there is no
local minimum, and the stationary condition can be used
to ﬁnd out the minimum of ˆµp(MA1, MA2).

The minimization along the longitudinal direction is
unconstrained, and thus two longitudinal component
minimization can be performed independently. The con-
dition is

where E ˆp is a energy of a given momentum p and βz
p is the
longitudinal component of velocity of p. Eq. 11 indicates
that longitudinal velocity of pi and qi end up being iden-
tical after the minimization. Then, it is easy to see that
each invariant masses MAi turns into transverse masses
with the solutions from the minimization of the longi-
tudinal components of invisible momenta. Since µp,2 is
invariant under independent longitudinal boosts on reso-
nance A1 and A2, we can boost each resonance and their
daughter particles to a frame where all the longitudinal
velocities of pi and qi vanishes, i.e. βz
= 0. Since
pi
all the longitudinal components on Eq. 9 vanishes in this
frame, using this frame is convenient for further discus-
sion.

The minimization along the transverse direction is con-
strained by the missing transverse momentum, and hence
the extremum condition, Eq. 9, gives a nontrivial rela-
tion. As long as MAi are diﬀerentiable at the minimum,
the condition can be written as a mass ratio MA1/MA2,

More speciﬁcally, for p = 2 and ˜m = 0, Eq. 12 is a sys-
tem of simple polynomial equations and thus µ2,2(0) has
an analytic solution. Applying the method of Lagrange

If ¯D < 0 or |qi| < 0, then

If non-trivial solutions do

masses ˜m of invisible particles, Eq. 12 is a complicated
radical equation. Analytically solving the minimization

numerically instead.
In the limit of p to ∞, by deﬁnition, the µp,2 converges

In this limit, the extremum condition in Eq. 12 con-
verges to the two types of solutions, the balanced and
unbalanced solutions in [5, 13, 20].
If the minimum is
developed where the diﬀerences of velocity βa
are
non-zero, the limit of Eq. 12 for p → ∞ requires that the
pi
reconstructed mass ratio MA1 /MA2 should converge to
1. This mass ratio corresponds to the balanced solution
of µ∞,2, i.e. MT 2. If one of the diﬀerences of velocity
approaches to zero at the minimum, the mass ratio
does not need to converge to 1 anymore. This momenta
conﬁguration is located at a minimum of corresponding
MAi , and it is the unbalanced solution of µ∞,2.

III. SEPARATION OF THE KINEMATIC

ENDPOINTS

To see the behavior of kinematic endpoint of µp,2, we
generated event samples by a phase-space Monte Carlo

√

program, TGenPhaseSpace class in ROOT, for two-body
and three-body decays whose visible particles are as-
sumed to be massless. To check dependence of endpoint
saturation on a total center-of-mass energy
ˆs of col-
liding partons, we further assume that
ˆs is ﬁxed for all
events. Upstream momentum including initial state radi-
ation is not considered in this analysis. µ∞,2 is evaluated
by a bisection-based method [21, 22]. The other µp,2’s are
calculated by a variable metric method equipped with ad-
ditional derivative information using Minuit2 [23]. We
further assume that all the visible particles are correctly
assigned to their mother resonance, and the true invisi-
ble particle masses mχ are supplied to the trial invisible
particle masses ˜m.

Let us consider a threshold production ﬁrst.

In this
case, both resonances are in their rest frame and hence
the transverse missing energy has limited chance to have
a larger value. Since µ∞,2 tends to have larger value for
large missing transverse energy, this is a minimal check-
point to test saturation of the kinematic endpoint.

Three-body decay is an ideal case for mass mea-
surement because most of µp,2 distributions have well-

production. The left histogram represents a symmetric mass
spectrum, and the right histogram represents an asymmet-
ric mass spectrum. Arrows show the locations of the upper
bounds for each distribution.

such that ˆµp takes the value of the corresponding kinematic
endpoint of µp,2. The left contours represent a symmetric

metric mass spectrum. Because these contours over-constrain
mass spectra, their intersection eventually crosses the true
mass spectrum.

saturated kinematic endpoints for both symmetric and
asymmetric mass spectrum if correct trial masses mχ of
invisible particles are supplied.
In a three-body decay,
mpi distribution is known to have a kinematic endpoint
= mAi − mχ. Because µp,2 is bounded below by
mmax
Eq. 6, events near the kinematic endpoint of mpi have
µp,2 bounded below by ˆµp(mA1−mχ + ˜m, mA2−mχ + ˜m).
If the trial invisible particle mass ˜m is the true mχ, then
the µp,2 is bounded below by ˆµp(mA1, mA2). Therefore,
events near the kinematic endpoint of mpi distribution
have µp,2 value near ˆµp(mA1 , mA2 ), and the kinematic
endpoint of µp,2 can be saturated as FIG. 2.
If these
kinematic endpoints are not hidden behind backgrounds,
then the kinematic endpoints are extractable from µp,2
distributions.

Fitting the extracted endpoints by the power mean
ˆµp(mA1, mA2) will reveal the true mass spectrum like
FIG. 3. Each ﬁtted kinematic endpoints constrain mass
spectra independently, and the constrained line eventu-
ally cross at a single point because the kinematic end-
points over-constrain the true mass spectrum. In a real-
istic case, the ﬁtting always comes with errors and hence
the constrained lines become constrained bands. The in-
tersection of these bands constrains the true mass spec-
trum then.

Two-body decay case is harder to have a well-saturated
endpoint. Because there is no assist from mpi distribu-
tions, only some of the µp,2 distributions saturates their
upper bound as FIG. 4. For a threshold production, the
kinematic endpoint of µ∞,2 distribution is saturated only
when the upper bound only when the true mass spectrum
is symmetric. If the true mass spectrum is asymmetric,
µ∞,2 distribution does not reach the upper bound. µp,2
also have the same problem because µp,2 is increasing
function of p as Eq. 4. If the kinematic endpoint µmax∞,2
of µ∞,2 distribution is smaller than the upper bound of
µp,2, then the kinematic endpoint of µp,2 is not saturated
because any of µp,2 cannot exceed µmax∞,2.

Although the kinematic endpoint is not saturated in
an asymmetric mass spectrum, there is a diﬀerence be-
tween tails of the distributions in both mass spectrum.
For p >∼ 2, tails of µp,2 distribution matches in symmet-
ric mass spectrum while it is not in an asymmetric mass
spectrum. Therefore, we can utilize this separated kine-
matic endpoints to resolve general asymmetric mass spec-
trum.

This feature is enhanced when we consider a pair pro-
duction at higher energy. For an asymmetric pair produc-
tion at some large

there exist some µp,2 such that its kinematic endpoint is
saturated as soon as µmax∞,2 exceed the upper bound of µp,2
distribution. Once some µp,2 has the saturated kinematic
endpoint, the kinematic endpoint does not change when

we consider higher
ˆs while the kinematic endpoint of
other µp,2 distribution has more chance to have larger
µp,2 value. Therefore, the separated kinematic endpoint
is a generic feature of an asymmetric mass spectrum.

A particular power p of µp,2 distribution which satu-
rates its upper bound is mass spectrum dependent. FIG.
6 shows there are speciﬁc µp,2’s having saturated kine-
matic endpoints. The reason the power p changes is that
only some p supports mass ratio in Eq. 12 compatible to
the true mass spectrum for near endpoint events. Sup-
pose µp,2 can saturate the upper bound, i.e. there exist
some events whose µp,2 solution satisfy

ˆµp(MA1, MA2) = ˆµp(mA1 , mA2 )

(14)

Let MA1/MA2 = c mA1 /mA2 where c is a positive con-
stant. Then above equation can be written as a mass
ratio between the trial resonance mass MAi and the true
resonance mass mAi.

endpoints in an asymmetric mass spectrum can be ob-
ˆs and the upstream mo-
served independently to the
mentum. However, we do not know at a glance whether
the kinematic endpoint of µp,2 is saturated when the true
mass spectrum is asymmetric, and we cannot just pick
a certain µp,2 to use it for mass measurement. Instead,
for an asymmetric mass spectrum, combined analysis of
µp,2 distributions than analysis of MT 2 distribution only
is expected to be more eﬃcient for mass measurement.

Whether all of the µp,2 have saturated kinematic
endpoint or not,
the kinematic endpoints of µp,2’s
are expected to have enhanced resolving power for
mass spectroscopy. To estimate the resolving power of
mass spectrum in two-body decay, we draw negative
log likelihood contours, FIG. 8, using near maximal
regions of µp,2 distributions for a reference mass spec-
trum and other template mass spectrum. To ignore
a sampling ﬂuctuation, we generated a large number
of events, 1,000,000 events, for each template and we
draw contours of large negative log likelihood value,
−2 ln L = 1000. We compared events having at least
90% of µp,2 value of µmax
In the case
of symmetric mass spectrum, MT 2 only analysis works
well because there are many events near the kinematic
endpoints. Templates with asymmetric mass spectrum
typically have less saturated kinematic endpoint of MT 2
and hence likelihood can distinguish them by diﬀerence

terminant is zero, and hence, ˆµ2(MA1 , MA2)2 is not a
strictly convex function. The previous argument is not
applicable in this case, but we can argue the existence of
multiple solutions easily because M 2
is a linear function
in |qi|.

When mpi = 0, there is ﬂat direction, ˆpi = ˆqi. Again,
multiple minima can be found if this direction is aligned,
but such events cannot locate near the kinematic end-
point. In this case, there is another type of multiple min-

Events satisfying above condition are the only cases
where ˆµ2(MA1, MA2)2 admit multiple minima.

Therefore, at least for p > 2 and p = 2 except some
special situations, we can conclude if the mass ratio in
Eq. 12 does not support the true mass spectrum, then
µp,2 cannot saturate the upper bound. We draw recon-
structed mass ratio of events on a tail of µp,2 distribution
in FIG. 7. By comparing FIG. 6 and FIG. 7, we can see a
correlation between the saturation of the kinematic end-
point of µp,2 and number of events on the tail of the µp,2
distribution, which have correctly reconstructed mass ra-
tio.

In
the case of asymmetric mass spectrum, the similar
argument holds for µp,2. However, we do not know
which µp,2 has a saturated kinematic endpoint, and
hence, the intersection of likelihood contours of several
µp,2’s constrains mass spectrum better than a single
likelihood contour of µp,2.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we have developed new kinematic vari-
ables µp,2, which is a smooth generalization of MT 2
and M2 variable, for measuring masses of pair-produced
particles decaying semi-invisibly. µp,2’s have distinctive
kinematic endpoints for symmetric and asymmetric mass
spectrum, and it can be used for surveying the true mass
spectrum.
If the true mass spectrum is asymmetric,
µp,2’s have separated kinematic endpoints, whereas if the
true mass spectrum is symmetric, µp,2’s share common
kinematic endpoints. While MT 2 analysis has several
foibles, which are only larger resonance mass dependence
of the upper bound and weak saturation of kinematic

endpoint when the true mass spectrum is asymmetric,
combined analysis of µp,2 constrain the true mass spec-
trum better. We expect µp,2 is particularly useful for
mass determination of new physics particles when un-
derlying physics is undetermined, such as slepton pair
production and chargino-neutralino co-production. Al-
though saturation of the kinematic endpoints of µp,2’s
depends on event topology, likelihood analysis shows that
mass measurement by µp,2 can be promising. We further
expect there should be a kinematic method for quanti-
fying asymmetric true mass spectrum in the case that
only some of µp,2’s have saturated kinematic endpoints,
and further study is ongoing [24]. While in this paper,
an eﬀect of wrong invisible particle mass is not discussed
and it is not ignorable in typical new physics scenarios.
Further study on the relationship between trial invisi-
ble particle mass and the kinematic endpoint of µp,2 is
needed.
