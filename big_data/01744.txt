ERGODIC PROPERTIES OF MATRIX EQUILIBRIUM STATES

IAN D. MORRIS

Abstract. Given a ﬁnite irreducible set of real d × d matrices A1, . . . , AM
and a real parameter s > 0, there exists a unique shift-invariant equilibrium
state on {1, . . . , M }N associated to (A1, . . . , AM , s). In this article we charac-
terise the ergodic properties of such equilibrium states in terms of the algebraic
properties of the semigroup generated by the associated matrices. We com-
pletely characterise when the equilibrium state has zero entropy, when it is
fully supported, when it gives distinct Lyapunov exponents to the natural co-
cycle generated by A1, . . . , AM , and when it is a Bernoulli measure. We also
give a general suﬃcient condition for the equilibrium state to be mixing, and
give an example where the equilibrium state is ergodic but not totally ergodic.

1. Introduction

For each integer M ≥ 2 let ΣM := {1, . . . , M }N with the inﬁnite product topol-
ogy, let σ : ΣM → ΣM denote the shift transformation σ[(xn)∞
n=1,
and when M is understood let Mσ denote the set of all σ-invariant Borel proba-
biltiy measures on ΣM . If x1, . . . , xm ∈ {1, . . . , M } are given, we deﬁne the cylinder
set

n=1] := (xn+1)∞

[x1x2 · · · xm] := {y = (yn)∞

n=1 ∈ ΣM : yi = xi for all i = 1, . . . , m}

which is both closed and open. It is by now classical that if f : ΣM → R is suitably
regular – for example, if

(1)

sup{|f (x) − f (y)| : x, y ∈ ΣM and x1 = y1, x2 = y2, . . . , xn = yn} = O(e−γn)

for some γ > 0 – then there exists a unique measure µ ∈ Mσ, called the equilibrium
state of f , such that

h(f ) +Z f dµ = sup

ν∈Mσ

h(ν) +Z f dν

where h(ν) denotes the metric entropy of the measure ν with respect to the trans-
formation σ. These equilibrium states enjoy numerous regularity properties: they
are fully supported on ΣM , have the Bernoulli property, and satisfy the following
Gibbs inequality: for some constant C > 0 depending only on f , the equilibrium
measure µ of f satisﬁes

C−1 ≤

µ([x1 · · · xn])

e−nP (f )+Pn−1

i=0 f (σix)

≤ C

for every x ∈ ΣM and n ≥ 1, where P (f ) = h(µ) + R f dµ. Using the Gibbs

property together with the Livˇsic periodic point criterion, one may also show that
f and g as above have the same equilibrium state if and only if f = g + h ◦ σ − h
for some continuous function h which also satisﬁes (1). The applications of the
theory of these Gibbs equilibrium states are too broad and deep to even attempt

to summarise here; we refer the reader only to the classic monograph [28], in which
the statements made above are proved1.

Recently a theory has begun to emerge of Gibbs equilibrium states associated
to matrix-valued, rather than real-valued, potentials. This theory is particularly
motivated by its applications to multifractal analysis ([9, 10, 12, 18]) and the study
of self-aﬃne fractals (see e.g.
[13, 25]). Let us brieﬂy recall some deﬁnitions. If
A1, . . . , AM belong to the set of d × d real matrices – which we denote by Md(R) –
then we deﬁne the top Lyapunov exponent of A := (A1, . . . , AM ) with respect to a
measure µ ∈ Mσ by

Λ(A, µ) := lim

log kAx1 · · · Axnkdµ(x).

Here and throughout this article, k · k denotes the Euclidean norm on Rd and the
operator norm on Md(R) derived therefrom. We remark that the limit Λ(A, µ) is
independent of the choice of norm used on Rd, and in particular is unaﬀected by
change-of-basis transformations; moreover, if µ is ergodic, then by the subadditive
ergodic theorem

lim
n→∞
for µ-almost-every x ∈ ΣM .

We say that A = (A1, . . . , AM ) ∈ Md(R)M is irreducible if there does not exist a
linear subspace U of Rd such that AiU ⊆ U for every i = 1, . . . , M and additionally
0 < dim U < d; otherwise we call A reducible. Clearly these deﬁnitions may also
be applied to sets of matrices.
If A is reducible then we may change basis in
such a way that every Ai becomes block upper triangular, with the upper-left block
corresponding to the action of Ai on the nontrivial invariant subspace. By inductive
descent it follows that if A is reducible then there exist an integer k > 1 and an
invertible matrix B ∈ Md(R) such that we may write

We denote the semigroup generated by the matrices A1, . . . , AM by S(A). Given
A = (A1, . . . , AM ) ∈ Md(R)M and s > 0 we deﬁne the pressure P (A, s) ∈ [−∞, +∞)

We observe that this limit exists by subadditivity. If A is irreducible and d > 1
then P (A, s) > −∞. The following corollary of the subadditive variational principle
([5], for an earlier result in the invertible case see [18]) relates P (A, s) to the top
Lyapunov exponents of A with respect to the various σ-invariant measures:

Theorem 1. Let A = (A1, . . . , AM ) ∈ Md(R)M and s > 0. Then

P (A, s) = sup
µ∈Mσ

h(µ) + sΛ(A, µ).

Let us say that µ is an equilibrium state for (A, s) if it attains the above supre-
mum. We shall refer to such measures generically as matrix equilibrium states.
D.-J. Feng and A. K¨aenm¨aki [11] have established the following description of the
set of equilibrium states of (A, s):

Theorem 2 (Feng-K¨aenm¨aki). Let A = (A1, . . . , AM ) ∈ Md(R)M with M, d ≥ 2,
and let s > 0.
If A is irreducible, then there exists a unique equilibrium state
µ ∈ Mσ of (A, s). Furthermore there exists a constant C > 0 such that for every
x1, . . . , xn ∈ {1, . . . , M }

(4)

C−1µ([x1 · · · xn]) ≤

If A is not irreducible, but nonetheless P (A, s) > −∞, let each Ai be written in the
form (2), and let A(i) = (A(i,i)
M ) for each i = 1, . . . , ℓ. Then the set of
equilibrium states of (A, s) is nonempty, and is precisely the convex hull of the set
of equlibrium states of (A(i), s) for integers i such that P (A(i), s) = P (A, s).

Properties of matrix equilibrium states further to those listed above have to the
best of the author’s knowledge not yet been investigated. The purpose of this article
is to explore the extent to which the equilibrium states of matrices enjoy the same
properties as the classical equilibrium states described in the introduction. We in
particular attempt to resolve the following questions:

• Are matrix equilibrium states fully supported?
• Are matrix equilibrium states mixing with respect to the shift transforma-

tion?

• Do matrix equilibrium states have positive entropy?
• To what extent does a matrix equilibrium state allow us to reconstruct the

original matrices?

• When are the Lyapunov exponents of a tuple of matrices (with respect to

their equilibrium state) all equal to one another?

The answers to these questions vary widely in diﬃculty. For example, the question
of full support of equilibrium states is almost trivial:

Theorem 3. Let µ be the unique equilibrium state of (A, s), where A ∈ Md(R)M
is irreducible. Then µ is fully supported if and only if 0 /∈ S(A).

Proof. Since cylinder sets form a basis for the topology of ΣM it is suﬃcient to
consider the question of whether every cylinder set has positive measure. By
the Gibbs inequality (4) the cylinder [x1 · · · xn] has zero measure if and only if
Axn · · · Ax1 = 0.
(cid:3)

In this article we attempt to give the most precise possible answers to the ques-
tions listed above. We will see that the answer to each of the diﬀerent questions

4

IAN D. MORRIS

is characterised by a slightly diﬀerent linear-algebraic property, and to attempt to
characterise all of the above properties in a single theorem would lead to an unrea-
sonably long statement. We therefore address these questions in separate theorems,
each of which is presented in its own chapter. In this article we are not able to give
equally satisfactory answers to all of the above questions: to a signiﬁcant extent
this reﬂects the degree to which the corresponding linear-algebraic properties are
understood.

We anticipate that in typical applications more will be known about the ma-
trices A1, . . . , AM than the simple fact of their being irreducible. We recall that
(A1, . . . , AM ) is called strongly irreducible if there does not exist a set F which
is equal to a ﬁnite union of proper nontrivial linear subspaces of Rd and satis-
ﬁes AiF ⊆ F for every i = 1, . . . , M . For the reader’s convenience, we note the
implications of some natural hypotheses on (A1, . . . , AM ) in the following theorem:

Theorem 4. Suppose that A = (A1, . . . , AM ) ∈ Md(R)M is irreducible, where
M, d ≥ 2, and suppose that no Ai is the zero matrix. Let s > 0, and let µ be the
equilibrium state of (A, s). Then:

(i) If A is strongly irreducible then µ is mixing and has nonzero entropy.
(ii) If every Ai is invertible then µ is fully supported and has nonzero entropy.
(iii) If S(A) contains an element whose eigenvalues are not all equal in modulus

then the Lyapunov exponents of A with respect to µ are not all equal.

(iv) If both (ii) and (iii) hold then µ is not a Bernoulli measure, and µ is not the

equilibrium state of (A, t) for any t 6= s.

This result follows easily from the combination of Theorem 3 with Theorems 5,

7, 13 and 14 below.

In the following sections we deal in turn with the properties of equilibrium states
described above. At the conclusion of the article we list some problems for future
research. To avoid trivialities, it will always be assumed that M ≥ 2.

2. Mixing

Perhaps surprisingly, ergodic matrix equilibrium states can fail to be mixing.

However, a mild additional irreducibility condition suﬃces to guarantee mixing:

Theorem 5. Let A = (A1, . . . , AM ) ∈ Md(R)M be irreducible, let s > 0, and let
µ ∈ Mσ be the unique equilibrium state of (A, s). Then:

(i) If for every n ≥ 1 the set of all products Ain · · · Ai1 such that i1, . . . , in ∈

{1, . . . , M } is irreducible, then µ is totally ergodic.

(ii) If µ is totally ergodic, then it is mixing.

Proof. (i). For every n ≥ 1 the M n-tuple An consisting of all products Ain · · · Ai1
with i1, . . . , in ∈ {1, . . . , M } in lexicographical order is irreducible by hypothesis,
and hence (An, s) admits a unique equilibrium state by Theorem 2, which we in-
terpret as a σn-invariant measure on ΣM . By Theorem 2 this measure is ergodic
with respect to σn. Since µ is σ-invariant it is also σn-invariant, and is clearly also
an equilibrium state for (An, s). By uniqueness it follows that for every n ≥ 1 the
measure µ must be equal to the equilibrium state of (An, s), and hence is ergodic
with respect to σn. This demonstrates that µ is totally ergodic.

µ(cid:0)X ∩ σ−nY(cid:1) ≤ C4µ(X)µ(Y )

for every pair of cylinder sets X, Y ⊆ ΣM . By standard approximation arguments
this inequality extends to all measurable sets X, Y ⊆ ΣM .

To show that this property implies mixing we follow a line of argument due to
D. Ornstein [27], which we reproduce here for the reader’s convenience. We begin
by showing that µ is weak-mixing. For a contradiction suppose that f : ΣM → C is
a nonzero measurable function such that f (σx) = e2πiθf (x) µ-a.e, where e2πiθ 6= 1.
By total ergodicity θ must be irrational. Since |f ◦ σ| = |f | almost everywhere and
σ is ergodic with respect to µ, |f | is constant a.e., and by multiplying by a scalar
if necessary we may assume |f | = 1 a.e.

θ A) = µ(f −1(T −1

Let S1 denote the unit circle in C, and consider the measure f∗µ on S1 deﬁned by
(f∗µ)(A) = µ(f −1A). Since f (x) ∈ S1 a.e. this deﬁnes a Borel probability measure
on S1. Deﬁne Tθ : S1 → S1 by Tθz = e2πiθz, and observe that f ◦ σ = Tθ ◦ f
µ-a.e. For every measurable A ⊆ S1 we have (f∗µ)(T −1
θ A)) =
µ(σ−1(f −1A)) = µ(f −1A) = (f∗µ)(A) so that f∗µ is Tθ-invariant. Since Tθ is
uniquely ergodic, f∗µ is Lebesgue measure on S1. In particular f∗µ is not atomic,
and we may choose an interval A ⊂ S1 such that 0 < C4(f∗µ)(A) < 1. By
taking suitable rational approximations to θ we may ﬁnd a sequence (nj) of natural
numbers such that T nj
θ → idS1 uniformly as j → ∞, and it follows from this that
lim supn→∞(f∗µ)(T −n
µ(f −1A) = (f∗µ)(A) = lim sup
n→∞
= lim sup
n→∞

µ(σ−nf −1A ∩ f −1A) ≤ C4µ(f −1A)2 < µ(f −1A),

θ A ∩ A) = (f∗µ)(A). Hence using (5)

(f∗µ)(T −n

θ A ∩ A)

a contradiction, and we conclude that µ is weak-mixing as claimed.

Consider now the sequence of measures νn on ΣM × ΣM deﬁned by νn(X × Y ) :=
µ(σ−nX ∩ Y ). It is easy to check directly that every νn is (σ × σ)-invariant, and
it is clear that µ is mixing if and only if the only weak-* accumulation point of
(νn)∞
n=1 is µ × µ. Let ν be a weak-* accumulation point of this sequence: clearly
ν is (σ × σ)-invariant, and by (5) ν is absolutely continuous with respect to µ × µ.

6

IAN D. MORRIS

Since µ is weak-mixing with respect to σ, µ × µ is ergodic with respect to σ × σ, so
by absolute continuity we must have ν = µ × µ. It follows that limn→∞ νn = µ × µ
in the weak-* topology so that µ is mixing as required.
(cid:3)

The following example illustrates that total ergodicity can fail to hold in certain
cases where the irreducibility criterion Theorem 5(i) is not met. We note that while
the failure of the condition in Theorem 5(i) is necessary for the failure of mixing,
it is not suﬃcient: for example, if d = 2 and every Ai is given by the same rotation
through 2π/n for some n ≥ 3, then A is irreducible and the condition of Theorem
5(i) is not satisﬁed, but for every s > 0 the equilibrium state of (A, s) is the measure
of maximal entropy which is of course mixing.

Proposition 6. Let s > 0, and deﬁne A := (A1, A2) where

A1 :=(cid:18) 0 2

1 0 (cid:19) ,

A2 :=(cid:18) 0 1

2 0 (cid:19) .

Then for every s > 0, the unique equilibrium state µ of (A, s) is not ergodic with
respect to σ2. In particular it is not mixing with respect to σ.

Proof. The pair (A1, A2) is clearly irreducible since neither matrix has a one-
dimensional invariant subspace, so (A, s) has a unique equilibrium measure µ0 on
Σ2. Consider now the equilibrium states of the matrices

We we shall view these equilibrium states as σ2-invariant measures deﬁned on Σ2.
It follows from Theorem 2 that an ergodic σ2-invariant measure µ on Σ2 is an
equilibrium state of A1A1, A1A2, A2A1, A2A2 if and only if it is an equilibrium
state for one of two scalar-valued potentials, the ﬁrst such potential being given
by the upper-left entries of those matrices each raised to the power s and the
second by their lower-right entries each raised to the power s. Elementary com-
putations show that this gives rise to two distinct Bernoulli equilibrium states µ1,
µ2, and that interchanging the matrices A1 and A2 with one another interchanges
the two scalar-valued potentials and therefore interchanges the two distinct equi-
librium states. The equilibrium state µ0 of A1, A2 is also an equilibrium state of
A1A1, A1A2, A2A1, A2A2, but it is symmetrical with respect to the interchange of
A1 and A2 since the pair (A1, A2) is similar to (A2, A1) by the transformation
which interchanges the two co-ordinate axes, and Lyapunov exponents (and hence
equilibrium states) are unaﬀected by change-of-basis transformations. The only
equilibrium state of A1A1, A1A2, A2A1, A2A2 which is symmetrical with respect to
the interchange of A1 and A2 is 1
2 µ2.
We see that µ0 is a proper linear combination of distinct σ2-invariant measures,
and therefore µ0 is not ergodic with respect to σ2.

shall say that (x1, . . . , xn) ∈ {1, . . . , M }n is a cyclic permutation of (ω1, . . . , ωn) ∈
{1, . . . , M }n if (x1, . . . , xn) = (ωi+1, . . . , ωn, ω1, . . . , ωi) for some i ∈ {1, . . . , n}.
Theorem 7. Let A = (A1, . . . , AM ) ∈ Md(R)M be irreducible, let s > 0, and
let µ ∈ Mσ be the unique equilibrium state of (A, s). Then the following three
conditions are equivalent:

(i) The measure µ has zero entropy.
(ii) The measure µ is supported on a periodic orbit of σ.
(iii) There exist n, r ≥ 1 such that nr = d, symbols ω1, . . . , ωn ∈ {1, . . . , M } and
i=1 Ri of Rd into r-dimensional subspaces such that
AiRj = {0} when i 6= ωj, Aωj Rj = Rj+1 when 1 ≤ j < n, and Aωn Rn = R1.
For each i = 1, . . . , n the product Aωi−1 · · · Aω1 Aωn · · · Aωi maps Ri to itself
bijectively, and we have Axn · · · Ax1 6= 0 if and only if (x1, . . . , xn) is a cyclic
permutation of (ω1, . . . , ωn).

a decomposition Rd = Ln

We draw the reader’s attention to the fact that if an equilibrium state of an
irreducible tuple of matrices has zero entropy then not only is it supported on a
periodic orbit, but by (iii) above the period of that orbit must divide the dimension
d.

We remark that (iii) above is satisﬁed with n = 1, r = d = 2 if A1 is an irrational
is are zero. Less trivially we note examples such as

rotation of R2 and the other A′

in two dimensions, and even less trivially

The proofs of most directions of implication in Theorem 7 are relatively brief
and self-contained, but the implication (i) =⇒ (ii) is quite involved. To shorten
the proof and render it more easily digestible, we precede the proof of Theorem 7
with an ancillary result. For each p ≥ 1 let us deﬁne the p-radius of A to be the

a result due to M. A. Berger and Y. Wang ([2], for some interesting alternative
proofs see [3, 7]). We require the following:

Proposition 8. Let A = (A1, . . . , AM ) ∈ Md(R)M and ℓ ∈ N. If ̺∞(A) = ̺2ℓ(A)
then there exists (x1, . . . , xn) ∈ {1, . . . , M } such that ̺∞(A) = ρ(Axn · · · Ax1)1/n.

Proof. The trivial case ̺∞(A) = 0 is ignored. We ﬁrst claim that without loss of
generality one may take ℓ = 1. If ℓ > 1 then we may deﬁne A⊗ℓ := (A⊗ℓ
M ) ∈
Mdℓ(R)M to be the M -tuple of ℓth Kronecker powers of the matrices Ai (see [16,
§4.2] for deﬁnition and basic properties). Since kA⊗ℓk = kAkℓ and A⊗ℓB⊗ℓ =
(AB)⊗ℓ for every A, B ∈ Md(R) it follows by direct calculation that ̺∞(A⊗ℓ) =
̺∞(A)ℓ and ̺2(A⊗ℓ) = ̺2ℓ(A)ℓ, so we have ̺2(A⊗ℓ) = ̺∞(A⊗ℓ). The reader may
easily see using Gelfand’s formula that additionally ρ(A⊗ℓ) = ρ(A)ℓ for every A ∈
x1 )1/n then
Md(R), so if (x1, . . . , xn) is given such that ̺∞(A⊗ℓ) = ρ(A⊗ℓ
clearly ̺∞(A) = ρ(Axn · · · Ax1 )1/n as required.

We next claim that without loss of generality A may be taken to be irreducible.
If A is not irreducible let us write A in the form (2); since ρ(Axn · · · Ax1 ) =

n for every (x1, . . . , xn) ∈ {1, . . . , M }n, it follows via

by appealing to the maximality of i, the deﬁnitions of ̺∞ and ̺2, and the hypothesis
of the proposition. We therefore have ̺∞(A(i)) = ̺2(A(i)) with A(i) irreducible. If
ρ(A(i,i)

xn · · · A(i,i)

x1 )1/n = ̺∞(A(i)) then clearly
̺∞(A) ≥ ρ(Axn · · · Ax1)1/n ≥ ρ(A(i,i)

xn · · · A(i,i)

x1 )1/n = ̺∞(A(i)) = ̺∞(A)

and so if the conclusion of the proposition holds for the irreducible tuple A(i) then
it necessarily holds for A.

To complete the proof it remains to establish the proposition in the case where
ℓ = 1 and A is irreducible, for which we use an argument suggested by [29, §5] and
[15, Theorem 2]. By a theorem of J. Lagarias and Y. Wang ([20, Theorem 5.1]) it is
suﬃcient to construct an inner product norm k · k∗ on Rd such that kAik∗ ≤ ̺∞(A)
for every i = 1, . . . , M . This construction comprises the remainder of the proof.
Let h·, ·i denote the Euclidean inner product on Rd. For each integer r ≥ 1 let us
deﬁne a positive-deﬁnite symmetric bilinear form h·, ·ir on Rd by

By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality each of the forms h·, ·ir is then K-Lipschitz
in each variable with respect to the Euclidean distance on the Euclidean K-ball
about the origin. By the Arzel´a-Ascoli theorem we may thus choose a subsequence
j=1 such that h·, ·irj converges uniformly on compact subsets of (Rd)2 to a

max{kvk∗ : kvk ≤ 1} = 1. We conclude that k · k∗ is an inner product norm on Rd.

product Axn · · · Ax1 .
(cid:3)

Proof of Theorem 7. The implication (ii) =⇒ (i) is trivial, so we shall begin by
establishing (i) =⇒ (ii). Let us therefore assume that the equilibrium measure µ
of (A, s) satisﬁes (i), and let 2ℓ > s be an even integer. We claim that µ is also the
equilibrium state of (A, 2ℓ). Indeed, we have

= h(µ) + 2ℓΛ(A, µ)

using the fact that s/2ℓ < 1, the fact that µ is an equilibrium state for (A, s),
and ﬁnally the fact that h(µ) = 0. This inequality demonstrates that µ is the
equilibrium state of (A, 2ℓ) as claimed.
Now, comparing (3) and (6) we have

and since P (A, 2ℓ) = h(µ) + 2ℓΛ(A, µ) = 2ℓΛ(A, µ) we have ̺2ℓ(A) = eΛ(A,µ). By
[23, Proposition 2.2] on the other hand we have

it follows that log ̺∞(A) = Λ(A, µ). We therefore have ̺2ℓ(A) = ̺∞(A), and
by Proposition 8 there exist an integer n ≥ 1 and ﬁnite sequence (x1, . . . , xn) ∈
{1, . . . , M }n such that ̺∞(A) = ρ(Axn · · · Ax1)
n . Deﬁne z ∈ ΣM by zqn+r = xr for
every q ≥ 1 and r ∈ {1, . . . , n} so that σnz = z, and let µ′ := 1
i=0 δσiz ∈ Mσ.
We have

Λ(A, µ′) =

Hence

h(µ′) + sΛ(A, µ′) = sΛ(A, µ′) = sΛ(A, µ) = h(µ) + sΛ(A, µ) = P (A, s)

so that µ′ is an equilibrium state of (A, s). Since only one such equilibrium state
exists we have µ′ = µ. We conclude that µ is supported on a periodic orbit as
claimed, and this completes the proof of the equivalence of (i) and (ii).

To prove (iii) =⇒ (ii) we argue as follows. Let ω1, . . . , ωn be as in (iii) and let
z ∈ ΣM be deﬁned by zqn+r := ωr for every q ≥ 1 and 0 ≤ r < n. Clearly σnz = z.
It is straightforward to see that if y /∈ {z, σz, . . . , σn−1z}, then for large enough
m the ﬁnite sequence (y1, . . . , ym) contains a ﬁnite subword (yk, yk+1, . . . , yk+n−1)
which is not equal to a cyclic permutation of (ω1, . . . , ωn). In particular we have
Ayk+n−1 · · · Ayk = 0 using (iii), and therefore Aym · · · Ay1 = 0. It follows from the
Gibbs inequality (4) that µ([y1 · · · ym]) = 0, and since [y1 · · · ym] is an open neigh-
bourhood of y, the point y is not in the support of µ. Since y /∈ {z, σz, . . . , σn−1z}
was arbitrary it follows that the support of µ is a subset of {z, σz . . . , σn−1z}, and
µ is supported on a periodic orbit as claimed. This completes the proof of the
implication (iii) =⇒ (ii).

It remains only to prove (ii) =⇒ (iii). Suppose that ω = σnω ∈ ΣM is pe-
riodic with period n and that µ = 1
i=0 δσiω is the unique equilibrium state
of the irreducible matrices A1, . . . , AM . Since µ([x1 · · · xn]) 6= 0 if and only if
(x1, . . . , xn) = (ωi−1 · · · ω1ωn · · · ωi) for some i = 1, . . . , n, it follows from the Gibbs
property that kAxn · · · Ax1 k 6= 0 if and only if the same condition holds. Since µ
is an equilibrium state its top Lyapunov exponent cannot equal −∞, so we have
ρ(Aωn · · · Aω1 ) > 0.

nPn−1

We recall that if A : Rd → Rd is a linear map and v ∈ Rd, then Akv = 0 for some
k ≥ 1 if and only if Adv = 0. In particular AdRd is an A-invariant subspace of Rd
on which A acts bijectively. Deﬁne r to be the rank of the product (Aωn · · · Aω1)d.

ERGODIC PROPERTIES OF MATRIX EQUILIBRIUM STATES

11

Since this product has nonzero spectral radius, this rank is nonzero, and since the
rank of a product AB is always equal to the rank of the product BA, the rank of
every product (Aωi−1 · · · Aω1 Aωn · · · Aωi )d is also equal to r. For each i = 1, . . . , n
deﬁne Ri := (Aωi−1 · · · Aω1 Aωn · · · Aωi)dRd and note that each Ri has dimension r
and that Aωi−1 · · · Aω1Aωn · · · Aωi is a bijection from Ri to itself. It is clear from
the deﬁnition that Aωi Ri ⊆ Ri+1 when 1 ≤ i < n and that Aωn Rn ⊆ R1, and
since Aωi−1 · · · Aω1Aωn · · · Aωi is a bijection from Ri to itself we must in fact have
AωiRi = Ri+1 when 1 ≤ i < n and Aωn Rn = R1.

Let 1 ≤ j ≤ M and 1 ≤ i ≤ n. If j 6= ωi then Aj Aωi−1 · · · Aω1 Aωn · · · Aωi is zero,
and therefore AjRi = {0}. If j = ωi then we of course have Aj Ri = Ri+1 if i < n,
or AjRi = R1 otherwise. For each k = 1, . . . , n let Vk denote the span of the union
of R1, . . . , Rk. We observe in particular that AjVn ⊆ Vn for every j = 1, . . . , M ,
and since Vn contains the r-dimensional space R1, it follows that the dimension of
Vn is nonzero so that by irreducibility Vn = Rd.

We claim that dim Vk = kr for every k = 1, . . . , n. For k = 1 this is clear.
Given that dim Vk = kr, to show that dim Vk+1 = (k + 1)r it suﬃces to show that
Vk ∩ Rk+1 = 0. When i 6= j the product

(Aωi−1 · · · Aω1 Aωn · · · Aωi )(Aωj−1 · · · Aω1Aωn · · · Aωj )

is zero, so Aωi−1 · · · Aω1Aωn · · · AωiRj = {0} when i 6= j by the deﬁnition of Rj.
We also of course have Aωk · · · Aω1Aωn · · · Aωk+1Rk+1 = Rk+1. It follows from these
observations that the product Aωk · · · Aω1 Aωn · · · Aωk+1 is identically zero on Vk and
has trivial kernel on Rk+1. We deduce that Vk contains only the trivial element of
Rk+1 and therefore Vk ∩ Rk+1 = {0} as required. We conclude by induction that
i=1 Ri as claimed. This completes the

d = dim Vn = nr, and it follows that Rd =Ln

proof of (ii) =⇒ (iii) and hence completes the proof of the theorem.

4. Characterisation by equilibrium states

In this section we investigate when (A, s) and (B, t) can have the same equilibrium

state when either A is distinct from B, s is distinct from t, or both.

Clearly if two M -tuples A, B ∈ Md(R)M are conjugate to one another by a
simultaneous change-of-basis transformation then for each s > 0 the equilibrium
state of (A, s) equals that of (B, s). The converse is easily seen to be false, since
two ﬁnite irreducible subsets of O(2) may fail to be conjugate in this fashion, but
both will have the same equilibrium states since all of their respective products will
have norm 1. Nonetheless the following result shows that each equilibrium state
of a tuple A completely determines, and is determined by, the spectral radius of
every product of the elements of A, and moreover contains enough information to
determine completely the top Lyapunov exponent of A with respect to all invariant
measures.

Theorem 9. Let A = (A1, . . . , AM ) ∈ Md1(R)M , B = (B1, . . . , BM ) ∈ Md2(R)M be
irreducible, where d1, d2 ≥ 1. Let s, t > 0, and suppose that P (A, s), P (B, t) > −∞.
Then the following are equivalent:

(i) The equilibrium states of (A, s) and (B, t) are identical.
(ii) There is a constant C > 0 such that
C−1e−nP(A,s)kAin · · · Ai1 ks ≤ e−nP(B,t)kBin · · · Bi1 kt ≤ Ce−nP(A,s)kAin · · · Ai1 ks

for every (i1, . . . , in) ∈ {1, . . . , M }n.

12

(iii) We have

e−nP(A,s)ρ(Ain · · · Ai1 )s = e−nP(B,t)ρ(Bin · · · Bi1 )t

for every (i1, . . . , in) ∈ {1, . . . , M }n.

(iv) There is a constant λ ∈ R such that sΛ(A, ν) = λ+tΛ(B, ν) for every ν ∈ Mσ.

Proof. The implication (iv) =⇒ (i) is a trivial consequence of the deﬁnition of
equilibrium state given after Theorem 1; the implication (i) =⇒ (ii) is a simple
corollary of the Gibbs inequality; and the implication (ii) =⇒ (iii) follows from
Gelfand’s formula. To prove (iii) =⇒ (iv) we argue as follows. Deﬁne λ := P (A, s)−
P (B, t) so that

1.6] together with the subadditive ergodic theorem we have for µ-a.e. x ∈ ΣM

and

Λ(A, ν) = lim

Λ(B, ν) = lim

In view of (8) we deduce that sΛ(A, ν) = λ + tΛ(B, ν). We conclude that (iv)
is satisﬁed for all ergodic measures ν, and the general case follows by a standard
ergodic decomposition argument.
(cid:3)

While Theorem 9 gives insight into when (A, s) and (B, s) can have the same
equilibrium state, its implications for the comparison between the equilibrium states
of (A, s1) and (A, s2) are at least as interesting. We note the following:

Theorem 10. Let A = (A1, . . . , AM ) ∈ Md(R)M be irreducible with d ≥ 2. Then
the following are equivalent:

(i) There exist distinct s1, s2 > 0 such that the equilibrium states of (A, s1) and

(A, s2) are identical.

(ii) There is a number λ ∈ R such that every element of S(e−λA) has spectral

radius either 1 or 0.

(iii) There exist a ≥ 0, b ∈ R such that P (A, s) = a + bs for all s > 0.
(iv) The equilibrium state of (A, s) is the same for every s > 0.

Proof. The implication (iv) =⇒ (i) is trivial. If (i) holds then by Theorem 9 we
have

−nP (A, s1) + s1 log ρ(Axn · · · Ax1) = −nP (A, s2) + s2 log ρ(Axn · · · Ax1)

for every (x1, . . . , xn), so that in each case either ρ(Axn · · · Ax1 ) = 0 or

(s1 − s2) log ρ(Axn · · · Ax1) = n(P (A, s1) − P (A, s2)).

Taking λ := (P (A, s1) − P (A, s2))/(s1 − s2) it follows that e−λnρ(Axn · · · Ax1) ∈
{0, 1} for every (x1, . . . , xn), and this proves (ii).

If (ii) holds then by an argument similar to the proof of Theorem 9 it follows
that for every ν ∈ Mσ the top Lyapunov exponent Λ(A, ν) is either λ or −∞, and
therefore

P (A, s) = sλ + sup{h(ν) : ν ∈ Mσ and Λ(A, ν) 6= −∞}.

ERGODIC PROPERTIES OF MATRIX EQUILIBRIUM STATES

13

We note that the supremum is over a nonempty set since P (A, s) > −∞ by irre-
ducibility, and this establishes (iii).

If (iii) holds, let s1, s2 > 0 and let µ1, µ2 be the equilibrium states of (A, s1) and

s1 + s2

(A, s2) respectively. We have

Without additional assumptions on the matrices Ai we are unable to shed further
light on exactly when the situation of Theorem 10 occurs, since the structure of
matrix semigroups in which every element has spectral radius either 1 or 0 does
not appear to have been investigated. It is also unclear in general exactly which
measures can arise as the equilibrium state in this case. However, at the end of the
following section we will see that when the matrices Ai are invertible, the situation
of Theorem 10 can be neatly characterised.

5. Bernoulli measures and Lyapunov exponents

We recall that a Bernoulli measure on ΣM is a probability measure of the form ν N
where ν is a probability measure on {1, . . . , M }. The following result characterises
those cases in which a matrix equilibrium state is a Bernoulli measure:

Theorem 11. Let A = (A1, . . . , AM ) ∈ Md(R)M be irreducible, let s > 0, and let
µ ∈ Mσ be the unique equilibrium state of (A, s). Then the measure µ is a Bernoulli
measure if any only if for every B1, B2 ∈ S(A) we have ρ(B1B2) = ρ(B1)ρ(B2).

Before proving the theorem we require the following lemma, which is of a stan-
dard type but is sharper than typical formulations (compare e.g. [10, Proposition
2.8], [34, Lemma 3.1]).

Lemma 12. Let A = (A1, . . . , AM ) ∈ Md(R)M be irreducible. Then there exists
δ > 0 such that for every B1, B2 ∈ Md(R) we may ﬁnd (i1, . . . , ik) with 0 ≤ k < d
such that kB1Ai1 · · · Aik B2k ≥ δkB1k · kB2k. (Here we interpret a product of length
zero as being the identity matrix.)

Proof. Clearly we may restrict our attention to the case in which kB1k = kB2k = 1,
the remaining cases following by homogeneity. By compactness it suﬃces to show
that we may always choose a product A = Ai1 · · · Aik such that B1AB2 is nonzero.
Fix B1 and B2 and let v be a nonzero vector in the image of B2. For each k =
0, . . . , d − 1 let Vk denote the space spanned by all vectors of the form Ai1 · · · Aim v
where 0 ≤ m ≤ k. We have dim V0 = 1 and dim Vk+1 ≥ dim Vk for every k, and
clearly AiVk ⊆ Vk+1 when 0 ≤ k < d − 1. Since 1 = dim V0 ≤ dim Vk ≤ d for
every k, we have dim Vk+1 = dim Vk for some k by the pigeonhole principle, so Vk
is an A-invariant subspace with nonzero dimension and therefore is equal to Rd. In

14

IAN D. MORRIS

particular Vd−1 = Rd and so Vd−1 contains a vector which is not in the kernel of B1.
This implies that there exists A = Ai1 · · · Aik with 0 ≤ k < d such that B1Av 6= 0,
and therefore B1AB2 6= 0 as desired.
(cid:3)

Proof of Theorem 11. Suppose that µ is a Bernoulli measure. If (x1, . . . , xn) and
(y1, . . . , yn) are arbitrary permutations of each other then

kAxn · · · Ax1ks ≤ CenP (A,s)µ([x1 · · · xn])

= CenP (A,s)µ([y1 · · · yn]) ≤ C2kAyn · · · Ay1ks

by the Gibbs inequality (4). By this principle it follows that if B1, B2 ∈ S(A) then
for every n ≥ 1

k(B1B2)nk ≤ C

2

s kBn

1 Bn

2 k ≤ C

2

s kBn

1 k · kBn
2 k

and therefore ρ(B1B2) ≤ ρ(B1)ρ(B2) by Gelfand’s formula. On the other hand,
by the preceding lemma there exist a constant δ > 0 and a sequence of matrices
B(n)

3 = Ai1(n) · · · Aikn (n) such that for every n ≥ 1

s kB3k · k(B1B2)nk

for inﬁnitely many n, and therefore ρ(B1)ρ(B2) ≤ ρ(B1B2) by Gelfand’s formula
again. This proves the ﬁrst direction of the theorem.

To prove the second direction, we note that the one-dimensional matrices B1
up to BM deﬁned by Bi := ρ(Ai) satisfy ρ(Ai1 · · · Ain ) = ρ(Bi1 · · · Bin ) for every
i1, . . . , in ∈ {1, . . . , M }n for every n ≥ 1, and it follows by Theorem 9 that µ is
the equilibrium state of ((B1, . . . , BM ), s); but the equilibrium state of a set of
one-dimensional matrices is a Bernoulli measure.
(cid:3)

A semigroup S with the property that ρ(B1B2) = ρ(B1)ρ(B2) for all B1, B2 ∈
S is sometimes said to have multiplicative spectral radius. Semigroups of non-
invertible matrices with this property are at present not completely understood
(though see [26, 30]). An example of a ﬁnitely-generated semigroup of non-invertible
matrices in which the spectral radius is multiplicative is provided by the matrices

A1 :=(cid:18) 1

The reader may verify directly that {±A1, . . . , ±A4} is a semigroup in which ev-
ery element has spectral radius 1. Moreover since A1 and A2 have an eigenbasis
consisting of the horizontal axis and the negative diagonal, and A3 and A4 have
an eigenbasis consisting of the vertical axis and the positive diagonal, this set is
irreducible.

However, semigroups of invertible matrices with multiplicative spectral radius
have been completely characterised in [30], and this allows us to present a second
theorem on Bernoulli measures as equilibrium states. For each A ∈ Md(R) we
recall that the singular values of A, denoted α1(A), . . . , αd(A), are the non-negative
square roots of the eigenvalues of the positive semideﬁnite matrix AT A, listed in

ERGODIC PROPERTIES OF MATRIX EQUILIBRIUM STATES

decreasing order with repetition in the case of multiplicity. We note the identity
α1(A) · · · αd(A) = | det A| for every A ∈ Md(R). Given µ ∈ Mσ and A ∈ Md(R)M
we deﬁne the Lyapunov exponents of A with respect to µ to be the numbers

λi(A, µ) := lim

log αi(Axn · · · Ax1)dµ(x).

ponent Λ(A, µ) deﬁned in section 1. A result related to Theorem 13 is presented in
[25, §3] in the context of equilibrium states of the singular value function (see §6
for the deﬁnition).

Theorem 13. Let A = (A1, . . . , AM ) ∈ Md(R)M be irreducible and suppose that
none of the matrices Ai is equal to the zero matrix. Let s > 0 and let µ the
equilibrium state of (A, s). Then the following three conditions are equivalent:

(i) The measure µ is a fully-supported Bernoulli measure, and each of the matri-

ces A1, . . . , AM is invertible;

Proof. If (i) holds then by Theorem 11 we have ρ(B1B2) = ρ(B1)ρ(B2) for every
B1, B2 ∈ S(A). The semigroup generated by the matrices ρ(Ai)−1Ai thus consists
entirely of matrices with spectral radius equal to 1. A theorem of V. Protasov
and A. Voynov ([30, Theorem 2]) implies that this semigroup is conjugate to a
subsemigroup of O(d) by a suitable change-of-basis matrix. It follows that ρ(Ai) =
| det Ai|1/d for every i = 1, . . . , M , and we have obtained (iii). If (iii) holds then by a
suitable change of basis we may take B to be the identity. By the deﬁnition of O(d)
every Ai1 · · · Ain satisﬁes (Ai1 · · · Ain )T Ai1 · · · Ain = (det Ai1 · · · Ain )2/dId and so
the singular values of Ai1 · · · Ain are all equal to | det Ai1 · · · Ain |1/d. It follows that
the Lyapunov exponents λi(A, ν) are independent of i for every ν ∈ Mσ, and we
obtain (ii).

for each k = 1, . . . , M . Using the Gibbs inequality we deduce

| det Ak|s/d ≥ C−1kAkks > 0

for each k = 1, . . . , M and it follows that every Ak is invertible as required, com-
pleting the proof of the theorem.
(cid:3)

We may now prove the result mentioned at the end of the previous section, which
describes completely the situation in which the matrices Ai are all invertible and
in which the equilibrium state of (A, s) is independent of s:

Theorem 14. Let A = (A1, . . . , AM ) ∈ Md(R)M be irreducible, and suppose that
every Ai is invertible. Then the following are equivalent:

(i) The equilibrium state of (A, s) is the same for every s.
(ii) There exists s > 0 such that the equilibrium state of (A, s) is the measure of

maximal entropy on ΣM .

(iii) There exist λ ∈ R and invertible B ∈ Md(R) such that e−λB−1AiB ∈ O(d)

for every i = 1, . . . , M .

Proof. If (iii) holds then it is clear that Λ(A, ν) = λ for every ν ∈ Mσ, and it
follows from the variational principle that for every s > 0 the equilibrium state of
(A, s) is the measure of maximal entropy. This implies both (i) and (ii).

If (i) holds then by Theorem 10 there is a number λ such that S(e−λA) consists
only of matrices with spectral radius 1 or 0, and by invertibility they must all
have spectral radius 1. It follows that ρ(Axn · · · Ax1 ) = eλn for every x1, . . . , xn ∈
{1, . . . , M } and every n ≥ 1. By an argument similar to Theorem 9 it follows that

ERGODIC PROPERTIES OF MATRIX EQUILIBRIUM STATES

17

Λ(A, ν) = λ for every ν ∈ Mσ. It follows by the variational principle that for every
s > 0 the measure of maximal entropy is the equilibrium state of (A, s), and this
implies (ii).

If (ii) holds then since the equilibrium measure of (A, s) is a Bernoulli measure,
it follows by by Theorem 13 that there is an invertible matrix B ∈ Md(R) such that
| det Ai|1/dB−1AiB ∈ O(d) for every i = 1, . . . , M . The measure µ is therefore the
unique Bernoulli measure such that

µ([i]) =

s
d

| det Ai|
eP (A,s)

for every i = 1, . . . , M . Since µ is the measure of maximal entropy it follows that
| det Ai|1/d takes a value independent of i, which we call e−λ. This proves (iii) and
completes the proof of the theorem.

6. Directions for future research

6.1. Mixing properties. We have not been able to completely characterise when
matrix equilibrium states are mixing, and this is a natural problem for future
research. This depends in particular on the problem of characterising exactly
when the M n-tuple of products Ai1 · · · Ain is reducible while the original M -tuple
(A1, . . . , AM ) is irreducible.
In two dimensions this problem seems likely to be
accessible by elementary arguments, but in higher dimensions the situation is less
clear. We however make the following conjecture:

Conjecture 1. Let A ∈ Md(R)M be irreducible. Then:

(i) If for some s > 0 the equilibrium state of (A, s) is ergodic with respect to σd,

then it is mixing with respect to σ.

(ii) If there exists s > 0 such that the equilibrium state of (A, s) is mixing with
respect to σ, then for every s > 0 the equilibrium state of (A, s) is mixing with
respect to σ.

We have so far paid no attention to stronger forms of mixing. In view of the
quantitative mixing properties of the equilibrium states of real-valued potentials
it is natural to speculate whether cylinder sets mix exponentially rapidly with
respect to matrix equilibrium states. We have also not investigated the Kolmogorov
or Bernoulli properties of matrix equilibrium states (or strictly speaking, of their
natural extensions). We pose the following problem for future researchers:

Conjecture 2. The natural extension of every totally ergodic matrix equilibrium
state has the Bernoulli property.

6.2. When is the equilibrium state independent of s? In Theorem 10 it was
shown that an irreducible M -tuple A ∈ Md(R) has the same equilibrium state µ for
every s > 0 if and only if there is a constant λ such that every element of S(e−λA)
has spectral radius either 0 or 1. In the case of invertible matrices this situation was
characterised completely in Theorem 14. Other than in the invertible case – in which
case a spectral radius of 0 of course cannot occur – no attempt at characterising
irreducible matrix semigroups in which every matrix has spectral radius 0 or 1 seems
to have been made in the literature. Indeed, even the characterisation of irreducible
matrix semigroups in which every element has spectral radius 1 is not yet complete
(see [26, 30]). It is interesting to ask what necessary or suﬃcient conditions can
be found for (A1, . . . , AM ) to generate a semigroup with this property. It is also

18

IAN D. MORRIS

not clear exactly which measures can arise as the equilibrium state of such a tuple,
although by Theorem 14 this set of measures includes the measure of maximal
entropy, and by adapting the examples mentioned in §3 it may be seen to also
include periodic orbits whose length divides d.

6.3. Criteria for d-continuity. The d-metric, or Ornstein metric, is a metric on
the set of σ-invariant measures on {1, . . . , M }Z which captures dynamical features
of measures more eﬀectively than the weak-* topology. For example, with respect
to the d-metric entropy is continuous, and the set of measures with the Bernoulli
property, the set of mixing measures and the set of ergodic measures are all closed
sets. A deﬁnition of the d-metric and proofs of some of its basic properties may be
found in [14, 33]. Z. Coelho and A. Quas have shown that the equilibrium states of
real-valued potentials f : ΣM → R which satisfy (1) depend d-continuously on the
potential in an appropriate topology on the space of potentials [6]. It would be of
interest to determine exactly when matrix equilibrium states (or strictly speaking,
their natural extensions) depend d-continuously on the matrix entries.

Using the results in this article it is possible to show that the equilibrium states of
irreducible matrix sets do not always depend d-continuously on the matrix entries:
one may verify easily that for every ε > 0 the pair Aε := (A1, A2) given by

A1 :=(cid:18) 0 2

1 0 (cid:19) ,

A2 :=(cid:18) ε

2

1

0 (cid:19)

is strongly irreducible, and therefore by Theorem 5 the unique equilibrium state
of (Aε, 1) is mixing. On the other hand by Proposition 6, the limit as ε → 0 is
a pair A0 such that the unique equilibrium state of (A0, 1) is not mixing. This in
particular implies that the said equilibrium states do not vary d-continuously in the
limit ε → 0. We nonetheless make the following conjectures:

Conjecture 3. Let A ∈ Md(R)M be irreducible. Then the unique equilibrium state
µs of (A, s) depends d-continuously on s.

Conjecture 4. For each irreducible B ∈ Md(R)M and t > 0 let µB,t denote the
unique equilibrium state of (B, t). Suppose that A ∈ Md(R)M is irreducible and that
µA,s is mixing. Then (B, t) 7→ µB,t is d-continuous at (A, s).

We remark that if Conjecture 2 is true then Conjecture 4 follows directly. To

see this we note that

(9)

lim

(B,t)→(A,s)

µB,t = µA,s

in the weak-* topology by the following argument. By weak-* compactness, for
every sequence of pairs (B, t) converging to (A, s) the sequence of measures µB,t
has an accumulation point. To prove (9) it suﬃces to show that the only possible
accumulation point is µA,s. It is shown in [13, 24] that the pressure P (B, t) depends
continuously on (B, t). By this fact together with the upper semicontinuity of
entropy and of Lyapunov exponents it follows that any accumulation point of µB,t
as (B, t) → (A, s) must be an equilibrium state of (A, s), which by uniqueness must
equal µA,s. The convergence (9) follows. One may also show that necessarily

lim

(B,t)→(A,s)

h(µB,t) = h(µA,s),

ERGODIC PROPERTIES OF MATRIX EQUILIBRIUM STATES

19

since

lim sup

h(µB,t) ≤ h(µA,s)

(B,t)→(A,s)

by the upper semi-continuity of entropy, and

lim inf

(B,t)→(A,s)

h(µB,t) = lim inf

(B,t)→(A,s)

(P (B, t) − tΛ(B, t)) ≥ P (A, s) − sΛ(A, s) = h(µA,s)

by the continuity of pressure and the upper semi-continuity of Lyapunov exponents.
Since µA,s by hypothesis has the Bernoulli property, these two limits together imply
convergence in d by the ﬁnitely-determined property of Bernoulli processes (see e.g.
[33, §IV.2]).

6.4. Equilibrium states of the singular value function. A further problem for
future research is the extension of the results of this article to the equilibrium states
of the singular value function, deﬁned as follows. If A ∈ Md(R) and 0 < s < d then
we deﬁne

ϕs(A) := α1(A) · · · α⌊s⌋(A)α⌈s⌉(A)s−⌊s⌋,

where α0(A) := 1, and for s ≥ d we deﬁne ϕs(A) := | det A|s/d. One may show that
ϕs(AB) ≤ ϕs(A)ϕs(B) for every A, B ∈ Md(R) and s > 0, and that ϕs : Md(R) →
R is upper semi-continuous. Given A = (A1, . . . , AM ) ∈ Md(R)M , an equilibrium
state of ϕs is deﬁned to be a measure µ ∈ Mσ which maximises the quantity

h(µ) + lim
n→∞

1

nZ log ϕs(Axn · · · Ax1)dµ(x),

and the existence of at least one such equilibrium state for given A and s is guar-
anteed by an upper semi-continuity argument. When 0 < s ≤ 1 we simply have
ϕs(A) = kAks, and when d − 1 ≤ s < d we have

d−s

,

s+1−d

d−s A∧(d−1)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)

| det A|

ϕs(A) =(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)

so in these parameter ranges the equilibrium states of ϕs may be understood in
terms of the norm equilibrium states studied in the present article. (Indeed, this
reduction is implicitly exploited in the article [25].) In view of applications of these
equilibrium states in the dimension theory of self-aﬃne fractals (see e.g.
[1, 8,
13, 19, 25]) it would be of interest to be able to extend the results of this article
to the equilibrium states of the singular value function in the parameter range
1 < s < d − 1. However, at present no analogue of Theorem 2 for these equilibrium
states is known.
