Abstract

It is shown that the experimentally observed increase of the Young’s modulus in single-layer

graphene with low density of point defects leads to a noticeable enhancement of the thermal con-

ductivity in a wide temperature range.

Recently, the eﬀect of mechanical stiﬀness augmentation in graphene by controlled cre-

ation of a low density of point vacancy defects through Ar+ irradiation has been experi-

mentally revealed [1]. It has been found that the Young’s modulus (E2D) of the graphene

membrane increases with increasing irradiation dose and reaches a maximum of 550 Nm−1

at 0.2% defect content. For a higher defect content a decreasing E2D has been observed.

This eﬀect was attributed to suppression of the out-of-plane ﬂuctuations by defects.

The atomic simulation shows that this eﬀect is mainly originated from speciﬁc bonds

distribution in the surrounded monovacancy defects [2]. Moreover, it has been shown that

such unusual mechanical response is the feature of presence of speciﬁcally monovacancies,

whereas other types of point defects such as divacancy, 555-777 and Stone-Wales defects

lead to the ordinary degradation of the graphene mechanical stiﬀness [2].

Notice that this unusual behavior will aﬀect other important properties of defected

graphene. In this letter, we consider a possible impact of monovacancy defects at a tiny

concentration on the phonon thermal conductivity of graphene. Physically, a growing num-

ber of point defects will enhance the phonon scattering thus leading to the reduction in

the thermal conductivity. In our case, however, the increase of the Young’s modulus will

result in the increased sound velocities, which reduces anharmonic phonon-phonon scatter-

ing processes and, thereafter, enhances the thermal conductivity. These opposite eﬀects

will compete in a wide temperature range. The aim of our paper is to analyze the inﬂu-

ence of point defects on the thermal conductivity of graphene within a phenomenological

single-mode relaxation time approach with all important scattering mechanisms taken into

account.

Let us start with the well-known deﬁnition of sound velocities for longitudinal (LA) and

transverse (T A) phonon branches in isotropic case [3]

vLA = pE2D/ρ(1 − σ2),

vT A = pE2D/2ρ(1 + σ),

(1)

where σ is the Poisson’s constant, ρ is the material density and the Young’s modulus is

assumed to be a function of the defect density ndef . The inset in Fig. 1 shows the ﬁt to the

measured E2D as a function of defect concentration given in [1].

We use the Callaway’s theory where three phonon normal processes are taken into consid-

eration explicitly [4]. Notice that the important role of normal phonon scattering processes

in graphite-like materials and graphene has been noted in [5–7]. Thus, we consider four main

2

scattering mechanisms relevant for suspended graphene: sample border (rough boundary),

point defects, three-phonon normal and umklapp processes. Within the relaxation-time

approximation the total mean free path can be written as

l−1
tot,λ(q) = l−1

0 + l−1

pd,λ(q) + l−1

N,λ(q) + l−1

U,λ(q),

(2)

where l0, lpd,λ, lN,λ and lU,λ come from sample border, point defects, three phonon normal

and umklapp scattering, respectively, for a given phonon branch λ = (LA, T A, ZA) with the

wave vector q. The mean free path due to normal processes is written as (see, e.g., [5, 7])

l−1
N,λ(q) = BN,λω2

λ(q)T 3,

(3)

and for umklapp phonon scattering processes we employ a parametrized expression in the

form

U,λ(q) = BU,λT 3ω2
l−1

λ(q) exp(−Θλ/3T ),

(4)

where BN,λ and BU,λ are parameters and Θλ is the Debye temperature. It should be men-
tioned that in our case B(N,U )λ = ¯B(N,U )λ/vλ, and the numerical values of the parameters
¯BN,λ and ¯BU,λ are taken from [5]: ¯BN,λ = 2.12 × 10−25sK−3, ¯BU,λ = 3.18 × 10−25sK−3 for
λ = (LA, T A) and ¯BN,λ = 1.48 × 10−22sK−3, ¯BU,λ = 2.23 × 10−22sK−3 for λ = (ZA).

The boundary scattering is expressed as

l−1
0 =

(5)

with d being the eﬀective length determined from the geometry of the graphene sample [5].

The mean free path due to phonon-point defect scattering is taken to be

(6)

where S0 is the cross-section area per one atom of the lattice, Γ ≈ (ndef /2) × 10−15cm−2 is

the mass-ﬂuctuation phonon-scattering parameter (notice that 1% of vacancies corresponds

to ndef = 2 × 1013cm−2 [7]).

Within Callaway’s formalism, the diagonal components of the thermal conductivity tensor

κ(T ) can be presented by the sum of the Debye term

where Cph,λ(ω) = exp(ωλ(q)/kBT )/(exp(ωλ(q)/kBT ) − 1)2, Nλ(ω) is the density of states

function per mole for each phonon branch, kB is the Boltzmann constant. Summation is

performed over phonon polarization branches with the dispersion relations ωλ(q) = qvλ for

λ = LA, T A. For out-of-plane (ﬂexural) acoustic mode we use the dispersion law ωZA(q) =

q2/2m [8] (m is an eﬀective parameter taken here equal to 320 sec/cm), ltot,λ(q, T ) is the

phonon mean free path given by Eqs.(2)-(6). The explicit form of Nλ(ω) is taken from [5].

Fig. 1 shows the calculated κ(T ) based on Eqs. (7) and (8) at the ﬁxed concentration

of vacancies ndef = 1.5 × 1013 cm−2 for two cases: (a) the sound velocities do not depend

on ndef and have ﬁxed values taken from [9]: vLA = 21.3 × 105 cm/s, vT A = 13.6 × 105

cm/s (which corresponds to the Young’s modulus E2D ≈ 360 Nm−1), and (b) the sound
velocities are calculated by Eq.(1). For chosen ndef one has E2D ≈ 540 Nm−1, so that

cm−2 in case of actual (solid line) and constant (dashed line) sound velocities. The insert shows

a ﬁt to the experimentally observed Young’s modulus as a function of defect concentration (cf.

Ref. [1]).

vLA = 27.2 × 105 cm/s and vT A = 17.2 × 105 cm/s. As seen in Fig.1, in case of (b) markedly

enhanced thermal conductivity takes place in a wide temperature range. The reason is quite

4

clear because larger values of vLA and vT A lead to an increase of lN,λ(q) and lU,λ(q). At

higher concentrations of vacancies, the diﬀerence between two cases (a) and (b) disappears

which agrees with experimentally observed behavior of the Young’s modulus (see the insert

in Fig.1).

Fig.2 shows the thermal conductivity as a function of ndef at T = 300K. As is seen, the

FIG. 2: Thermal conductivity versus the concentration of vacancies in a 2.9 µm wide ribbon for

actual (solid line) and constant (dashed line) sound velocities. The insert shows the calculated

thermal conductivity versus temperature with the experimentally observed values of the Young’s

modulus for ndef = 0 (circles), 2 × 1012 cm−2 (squares), 8 × 1012 cm−2 (triangles), 3 × 1013 cm−2

(stars).

enhancement of κ takes place in the range of 2.8 × 1012 cm−2≤ ndef ≤ 5.3 × 1013 cm−2 only.

The explanation is as follows: at high temperatures the normal and umklapp scattering

mechanisms are of the most importance and, in this case, κ strongly depend on vλ (see,

e.g., [9]). In turn, vλ is a function of E2D in accordance with Eq. (1) and therefore depends

on ndef in this region. Accordingly, we have obtained the increased κ at small concentrations

of vacancies up to the value close to 5 ×1013 cm−2 with the maximum gain at ndef ∼ 7 ×1012

cm−2 which corresponds to the maximum of the Young’s modulus.

Summarizing, we have found a marked increase in the thermal conductivity of graphene,

5

which is a direct consequence of the experimentally observed eﬀect of ultrahigh stiﬀness

at low densities of vacancy defects. Our study shows that, in a limited range of defect

concentrations, the thermal transport demonstrates a rather unique behavior. Namely,

the growing number of defects provokes the enhancement of the thermal conductivity in a

wide temperature range. Physically, this follows from the fact that after about 100 K the

three-phonon scattering processes become dominant. They depend on the sound velocities

which grow with the Young’s modulus in some restricted region of ndef . This provides the

enhancement of the thermal conductivity. Below T ≤ 100 K the main sources of the phonon

scattering are sample border and point defects so that a strong increase in graphene stiﬀness

has no eﬀect on the thermal conductivity. Notice that our ﬁnding can be of importance in

development of graphene-based thermoelectric devices.
