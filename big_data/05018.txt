Chromatic index, treewidth and maximum degree

Henning Bruhn, Laura Gellert and Richard Lang

Abstract

We conjecture that any graph G with treewidth k and maximum degree

∆(G) ≥ k + √k satisﬁes χ′(G) = ∆(G). In support of the conjecture we

prove its fractional version.

Introduction

The least number χ′(G) of colours necessary to properly colour the edges of a
(simple) graph G is either the maximum degree ∆(G) or ∆(G)+1. But to decide
whether ∆(G) or ∆(G) + 1 colours suﬃce is a diﬃcult algorithmic problem [9].
Often, graphs with a relatively simple structure can be edge-coloured with
only ∆(G) colours. This is the case for bipartite graphs (K¨onig’s theorem) and
for cubic Hamiltonian graphs. Arguably, one measure of simplicity is treewidth,
how closely a graph resembles a tree. (See next section for a deﬁnition.)

Vizing [16] (see also Zhou et al. [18]) observed a consequence of his adja-
cency lemma: any graph with treewidth k and maximum degree at least 2k
has chromatic index χ′(G) = ∆(G).
Is this tight? No, it turns out. Using
two recent adjacency lemmas the requirement on the maximum degree can be
dropped to ∆(G) ≥ 2k − 1 whenever k ≥ 4; see Section 4. This immediately
suggests the question: how much further can the maximum degree be lowered?
We conjecture:

Conjecture 1. Any graph of treewidth k and maximum degree ∆ ≥ k +√k has

chromatic index ∆.

The bound is close to best possible: in Section 5 we construct, for inﬁnitely

many k, graphs with treewidth k, maximum degree ∆ = k + ⌊√k⌋ < k + √k,

and chromatic index ∆ + 1. For other values k the conjecture (if true) might
be oﬀ by 1 from the best bound on ∆. This is, for instance, the case for k = 2,
where the conjecture is known to hold.
Indeed, Juvan et al. [11] show that
series-parallel graphs with maximum degree ∆ ≥ 3 are even ∆-edge-choosable.
Theorem 2. Any simple graph of treewidth k and maximum degree ∆ ≥ k +√k

In support of the conjecture we prove its fractional version:

has fractional chromatic index ∆.

The theorem follows from a new upper bound on the number of edges:

2|E(G)| ≤ ∆|V (G)| − (∆ − k)(∆ − k + 1)

The bound is proved in Proposition 3. It implies quite directly that no graph

with treewidth k and maximum degree ∆ ≥ k +√k can be overfull. (A graph G

1

is overfull if it has an odd number n of vertices and strictly more than ∆(G) n−1
2
edges; a subgraph H of G is an overfull subgraph if it is overfull and satisﬁes
∆(H) = ∆(G).)

Thus, for certain parameters our conjecture coincides with the overfull con-

jecture of Chetwynd and Hilton [5]:

Overfull conjecture. Every graph G on less than 3∆(G) vertices can be edge-
coloured with ∆(G) colours unless it contains an overfull subgraph.

Because we can exclude that graphs with treewidth k and maximum degree

∆ ≥ k + √k are overfull, the overfull conjecture (as well as our conjecture)

implies that such graphs on less than 3∆ vertices can always be edge-coloured
with ∆ colours.

Graphs of treewidth k are in particular k-degenerate (see Section 2 for the
deﬁnition and some discussion). Indeed, Vizing [16] originally showed that k-
degenerate graphs, rather than treewidth k graphs, of maximum degree ∆ ≥ 2k
have an edge-colouring with ∆ colours. We brieﬂy list some related work on
edge-colourings and their variants in k-degenerate graphs.
Isobe et al. [10]
show that any k-degenerate graph of maximum degree ∆ ≥ 4k + 3 has a total
colouring with only ∆ + 1 colours. For graphs that are not only k-degenerate
but also of treewidth k, a maximum degree of ∆ ≥ 3k − 3 already suﬃces [4].
Noting that they are 5-degenerate, we include some results on planar graphs as
well. Borodin, Kostochka and Woodall [2, 3] showed that planar graphs have
list-chromatic index ∆(G) and total chromatic number χ′′(G) = ∆(G) + 1 if
∆(G) ≥ 11 or if the maximum degree and the girth are at least 5. Vizing [16]
proved that a planar graph G has a ∆(G)-edge-colouring if ∆(G) ≥ 8. Sanders
and Zhao [13] and independently Zhang [17] extended this to ∆(G) ≥ 7.

2 Deﬁnitions

All graphs in this article are ﬁnite and simple. We use standard graph theory
notation as found in the book of Diestel [6].

For a graph G a tree-decomposition (T,B) consists of a tree T and a collection
B = {Bt : t ∈ V (T )} of bags Bt ⊆ V (G) such that
(i) V (G) = St∈V (T )
(ii) for each edge vw ∈ E(G) there exists a vertex t ∈ V (T ) such that v,
w ∈ Bt, and

Bt,

(iii) if v ∈ Bs ∩ Bt, then v ∈ Br for each vertex r on the path connecting s and

t in T .

A tree-decomposition (T,B) has width k if each bag has a size of at most k + 1.
The treewidth of G is the smallest integer k for which there is a width k tree-
decomposition of G.
A tree-decomposition (T,B) of width k is smooth if
(iv) |Bt| = k + 1 for all t ∈ V (T ) and
(v) |Bs ∩ Bt| = k for all st ∈ E(T ).

2

All tree decompositions considered in this paper will be smooth. This is possible
as a graph of treewidth at most k always has a smooth tree-decomposition of
width k; see Bodlaender [1].

The fractional chromatic index of a graph G is deﬁned as

χ′

f (G) = min( XM∈M

∀e ∈ E(G)) ,
where M denotes the collection of all matchings in G and 1M the characteristic
vector of M . For more details on the fractional chromatic index, see for instance
Scheinerman and Ullman [14].

λM : λM ∈ R+, XM∈M

λM 1M (e) = 1

3 A bound on the number of edges

Theorem 2 follows quickly from a bound on the number of edges:

Proposition 3. A graph G of treewidth k satisﬁes

2|E(G)| ≤ ∆(G)|V (G)| − (∆(G) − k)(∆(G) − k + 1).

(1)

Before proving Proposition 3 we present one of its consequences:

Lemma 4. Let G be a graph of treewidth at most k and maximum degree ∆ ≥
k + √k. Then G is not overfull.

Proof. By Proposition 3 holds

∆|V (G)| − (∆ − k)(∆ − k + 1)

|V (G)| − 1

2|E(G)|
|V (G)| − 1 ≤
and as ∆ ≥ k + √k we obtain
2|E(G)|
|V (G)| − 1 ≤

∆|V (G)| − k − ∆ + k

|V (G)| − 1

= ∆.

=

∆|V (G)| − (∆ − k)2 − ∆ + k

|V (G)| − 1

This ﬁnishes the proof.

It follows from Edmonds’ matching polytope theorem that χ′

f (G) = ∆(G),
if the graph G does not contain any overfull subgraph of maximum degree ∆;
see [15, Ch. 28.5]. As the treewidth of a subgraph is never larger than the
treewidth of the original graph, Theorem 2 is a consequence of Lemma 4.

The proof of Proposition 3 rests on two lemmas. We defer their proofs to
the end of the section. For a tree T we write |T| to denote the number of its
vertices. If st ∈ E(T ) is an edge of T then we let T(s,t) be the component of
T − st containing s. For any number k we set [k]+ = max(k, 0).
Lemma 5. For a tree T and a positive integer d ≤ |T| it holds that

X(s,t):st∈E(T )

[d − |T(s,t)|]+ ≥ d(d − 1).

3

If T ∗ is a subtree of T then let δ+(T ∗) be the set of (s, t) so that st is an
edge of T with s ∈ V (T ∗) but t /∈ V (T ∗). (That is, δ+(T ∗) may be seen as the
set of oriented edges leaving T ∗.)

Lemma 6. Let T be a tree and let d ≤ |T| be a positive integer. Then for any
subtree T ∗ ⊆ T it holds that
X(s,t)∈δ+(T ∗)

[d − |T(s,t)|]+ ≤ [d − |T ∗|]+.

(2)

We introduce one more piece of notation. If (T,B) is a tree decomposition
of the graph G, then for any vertex v of G we denote by T (v) the subtree of T
that consists of those bags that contain v.

Proof of Proposition 3. Let (T,B) be a smooth tree decomposition of G of width k.
First note that for any vertex v of G, the number of vertices in the union of all
bags containing v is at most |T (v)| + k since the tree decomposition is smooth.
Thus deg(v) ≤ |T (v)| + k − 1.
Set d := ∆ − k + 1 ≥ 1, and observe that d ≤ |V (G)| − k = |T| as the tree
decomposition is smooth. We calculate

∆ − deg(v) ≥ [∆ − k + 1 − |T (v)|]+

= [d − |T (v)|]+ ≥ X(s,t)∈δ+(T (v))

[d − |T(s,t)|]+,

where the last inequality follows from Lemma 6.

Consider an edge st ∈ E(T ). Since the tree decomposition is smooth there is
exactly one vertex v ∈ V (G) with v ∈ Bs and v /∈ Bt. Setting φ((s, t)) = v then
deﬁnes a function from the set of all (s, t) with st ∈ E(T ) into V (G). Note that
φ((s, t)) = v if and only if (s, t) ∈ δ+(T (v)). Summing the previous inequality
over all vertices, we get

Xv∈V (G)

(∆ − deg(v)) ≥ Xv∈V (G) X(s,t)∈φ−1(v)

[d − |T(s,t)|]+

= X(s,t):st∈E(T )

[d − |T(s,t)|]+ ≥ d(d − 1),

where the last inequality is due to Lemma 5. This directly implies (1).

It remains to prove Lemma 5 and 6.

Proof of Lemma 5. We proceed by induction on |T| − d. The induction starts
when d = |T|. Then [d − T(s,t)]+ = d − T(s,t) and thus

X(s,t):st∈E(T )

[d − |T(s,t)|]+ = Xst∈E(T )(cid:0)|T| − |T(s,t)| + |T| − |T(t,s)|(cid:1)

= Xst∈E(T )

|T(t,s)| + |T(s,t)| = (|T| − 1)|T|.

Now, let d ≤ |T| − 1, which implies in particular |T| ≥ 2. Then T has a

leaf ℓ. We set T ′ := T − ℓ and note that d ≤ |T| − 1 = |T ′|.

4

Observe that for any edge st ∈ E(T ′) we get

|T(s,t)| =(|T ′
(s,t)| + 1
|T ′
(s,t)|

if ℓ ∈ V (T(s,t)),
if ℓ /∈ V (T(s,t)).

We denote by F the set of all (s, t) for which st is an edge in T ′ with ℓ ∈ V (T(s,t))
and with |T ′

(s,t)| ≤ d − 1. Then

[d − |T ′

(s,t)|]+ =([d − |T(s,t)|]+ − 1

[d − |T(s,t)|]+

if (s, t) ∈ F,
if (s, t) /∈ F.

(3)

Among the (s, t) ∈ F choose (x, y) such that y maximises the distance to ℓ.
This means, that st ∈ E(T ′
(x,y)) for any (s, t) ∈ F \ {(x, y)}. Consequently,
(x,y)| = |E(T ′
|T ′
Let r be the unique neighbour of the leaf ℓ. Then |T(ℓ,r)| = 1, and we obtain
(4)

(x,y))| + 1 ≥ |F| − 1 + 1.

[d − |T(ℓ,r)|]+ = d − 1 ≥ |T ′

(x,y)| ≥ |F|.

We conclude

X(s,t):st∈E(T )

[d − |T(s,t)|]+ = [d − |T(ℓ,r)|]+ + [d − |T(r,ℓ)|]+

+ X(s,t):st∈E(T ′)

[d − |T(s,t)|]+

[d − |T(s,t)|]+

(4)

(3)

≥ |F| + 0 + X(s,t):st∈E(T ′)
= X(s,t):st∈E(T ′)
(s,t)|]+
[d − |T ′
≥ d(d − 1),

where the last inequality follows by induction.

Proof of Lemma 6. We proceed by induction on |T|−d. For the induction start,
consider the case when d = |T|. Then

[d − |T(s,t)|]+ = [|T| − |T(s,t)|]+ = |T(t,s)|,

which yields

|T(t,s)| = |T| − |T ∗| = [d − |T ∗|]+.

[d − |T(s,t)|]+ = X(s,t)∈δ+(T ∗)

X(s,t)∈δ+(T ∗)
Now assume |T| − d ≥ 1. If every vertex in T − V (T ∗) is a leaf of T then
t is a leaf for every (s, t) ∈ δ+(T ∗). This implies |T(s,t)| = |T| − 1 ≥ d and the
left hand side of (2) vanishes.
Therefore we may assume that there is a leaf ℓ /∈ T ∗ of T whose neighbour
is not in V (T ∗). Set T ′ = T − ℓ, and observe that, by choice of ℓ, the set δ+(T ∗)

5

of edges leaving T ∗ is the same in T and in T ′. Moreover, |T(s,t)| ≥ |T ′
for every (s, t) ∈ δ+(T ∗). The desired inequality
[d − |T(s,t)|]+ ≤ X(s,t)∈δ+(T ∗)

X(s,t)∈δ+(T ∗)

(s,t)| holds

[d − |T ′

(s,t)|]+ ≤ [d − |T ∗|]+

now follows by induction.

4 A lower bound on the maximum degree

Vizing [16] (see also Zhou et al. [18]) proved that every graph of treewidth k
and maximum degree ∆ ≥ 2k has an edge-colouring with ∆ colours. We show
that this is not tight.

Proposition 7. For any graph G of treewidth k ≥ 4 and maximum degree
∆(G) ≥ 2k − 1 it holds that χ′(G) = ∆(G).

A graph G of maximum degree ∆ is ∆-critical, if all proper subgraphs can
be edge-coloured using not more than ∆ colours. For the proof of Proposition 7
we use Vizing’s adjacency lemma, as well as two adjacency lemmas that involve
the second neighbourhood.

Vizing’s adjacency lemma. Let uv be an edge in a ∆-critical graph. Then v
has at least ∆ − deg(u) + 1 neighbours of degree ∆.
Theorem 8 (Zhang [17]). Let G be a ∆-critical graph, and let uwv be a path
in G. If deg(u) + deg(w) = ∆ + 2 then all neighbours of v but u and w have
degree ∆.

Theorem 9 (Sanders and Zhao [13]). Let G be a ∆-critical graph, and let v be
a common neighbour of u and w such that deg(u) + deg(v) + deg(w) ≤ 2∆ + 1.
Then there are at most deg(u) + deg(v) − ∆ − 3 common neighbours x 6= u of v
and w.

Assume Proposition 7 to be wrong. Then there is a ∆-critical graph G of
treewidth at most k for ∆ = 2k − 1. Let (T,B) be a tree-decomposition of G of
width ≤ k. By picking an arbitrary root, we may consider T as a rooted tree.
For any s ∈ V (T ), we denote by ⌈s⌉ the subtree of T rooted at s, that is, the
subtree of T consisting of the vertices t ∈ V (T ) for which s is contained in the
path between t and the root of T .
Set L := {v ∈ V (G) : deg(v) ≥ k + 2}, and choose a vertex v∗ ∈ L that
maximises the distance of T (v∗) to the root (among the vertices in L). Let q be
the vertex of T (v∗) that achieves this distance. For S := N (q) ∩ T (v∗) and any
s ∈ S, deﬁne Xs :=St∈V (⌈s⌉) Bt, and let X := Bq ∪Ss∈S Xs. Note that by the
deﬁnition of v∗ and q

N (v∗) ⊆ X and X ∩ L ⊆ Bq.

(5)

Claim 10. All vertices of X \ Bq have degree at most k.
Proof of Claim 10. Suppose the statement to be false. Then there is an s ∈ S
for which Xs \ Bq contains a vertex of degree at least k + 1. Fix a vertex

6

moreover, w∗ has degree k + 1, it has a neighbour u∗ outside Bp, which then
has degree at most k (by choice of w∗).

w∗ ∈ {w ∈ Xs \ Bq : deg(w) ≥ k + 1} =: L′ that maximises the distance
of T (w∗) to s. Let p be the vertex of T (w∗) that achieves this distance. Set
Y = St∈V (⌈p⌉) Bt. As in (5) we have N (w∗) ⊆ Y and Y ∩ L′ ⊆ Bp. Since,
Vizing’s adjacency lemma implies that w∗ has at least ∆ − deg(u∗) + 1 ≥
2k − 1 − k + 1 = k neighbours of degree ∆. By (5), all vertices of degree ∆ of Y
have to be in Bq ∩ Bs. Since Bq ∩ Bs is a cutset of size at most k, the vertex w∗
is adjacent to all vertices in Bq ∩ Bs. As w∗ is therefore adjacent to at most k
vertices of degree ∆ it holds deg(u∗) = k. By deﬁnition of S, the set Bs contains
v∗, which implies that v∗ is adjacent to w∗ and of degree ∆. As k ≥ 4, it follows
that v∗ has degree ∆ = 2k − 1 ≥ k + 3, which means by (5) that v∗ has at least
three neighbours of degree ≤ k + 1. Thus, v∗ has a neighbour of degree ≤ k + 1,
which is neither u∗ nor w∗. This, however, contradicts Theorem 8 (applied to
v∗, w∗, u∗).

By (5) and since v∗ has degree at least k + 2, the vertex v∗ has a neighbour
u /∈ Bq. (In fact, v∗ has at least two such neighbours.) By Vizing’s adjacency
lemma, applied to uv∗, it follows that v∗ has at least ∆ − deg(u) + 1 ≥ k
neighbours of degree ∆. In particular, by (5)

v∗ is adjacent to every vertex in Bq, each of which has degree ∆.

(6)

Claim 11. Every u ∈ N (v∗) \ Bq has exactly k neighbours, all of which are
contained in Bq.

Proof of Claim 11. By Vizing’s adjaceny lemma (applied to uv∗), u is of degree
at least k. By (6), every vertex in Bq has degree ∆ and thus u /∈ Bq. The set
Bq is a cutset. This implies that u has all its neighbours in X. However, u
cannot be adjacent to any vertex w of degree ≤ k; otherwise we could extend
any ∆-edge-colouring of G − uw to G. It follows from Claim 10 that all of the
k neighbours of u are in Bq.

Since the vertex v∗ has degree at least k + 2, it has two neighbours u, w
of degree at most k + 1 (again by (5)). By Claim 11, the degree of u and w
is k. Thus, deg(u) + deg(v∗) + deg(w) ≤ k + ∆ + k = 2∆ + 1. Moreover, by
Claim 11 and (6), the vertices v∗ and w have k − 1 common neighbours in Bq.
As k − 1 > deg(u) + deg(v∗) − ∆ − 3, we obtain a contradiction to Theorem 9.
This ﬁnishes the proof of Proposition 7.

5 Discussion

Proposition 3 bounds the number of edges in a graph G of ﬁxed treewidth and
maximum degree. A simpler bound – only considering the treewidth – is easily
shown by induction (see Rose [12]):

2|E(G)| ≤ 2k|V (G)| − k(k + 1)

(7)

For ∆ < 2k and |V (G)| > ∆ + 1 a straightforward computation shows that the
bound of Proposition 3 is strictly better than (7). The bounds are the same if

7

∆ = 2k or if |V (G)| = ∆ + 1. For ∆ = 2k this is illustrated by the kth power
P k of a long path P .
The bound in Proposition 3 is tight. There are simple examples that show
this: Take the complete graph Kk on k vertices and add r ≥ 1 further vertices
each adjacent to each vertex of Kk. These graphs also demonstrate that Con-
jecture 1 (if true) would be tight or almost tight. Indeed, if k +⌊k⌋ is even, and
k not a square, then we obtain for r = ⌊k⌋ + 1 an overfull graph with maximum
√k⌋, we obtain
degree ∆ = k + ⌊k⌋. If k + ⌊
an overfull graph with ∆ = k + ⌊√k⌋ − 1.
These tight graphs, however, have a very special structure. In particular,
they all satisfy |V (G)| = ∆(G) + 1. Both, Conjecture 1 and Proposition 3, stay
tight for an arbitrarily large number of vertices:

√k⌋ is odd, then, by setting r = ⌊

Proposition 12. For every k0 ≥ 4 there is a k ∈ {k0, k0 + 1, . . . , k0 + 8} such
that for every n ≥ 4k there exists a graph G on n vertices with treewidth at most
k and maximum degree ∆ = k + ⌊

√k⌋ < k + √k such that
2|E(G)| = ∆n − (∆ − k)(∆ − k + 1).
In particular, the graph G is overfull whenever n is odd.

We need the following lemma.

Lemma 13. Let c, r ∈ N. Then there is a graph with degree sequence

d =(cid:0) c . . . , c
| {z }

r+1

, c − 1, c − 2, . . . , 1(cid:1) ∈ Zc+r

if and only if 4 divides c(2r + c + 1) and if r2 ≥ c.

We defer the proof of Lemma 13 until the end of the section and only show

suﬃciency. A closer look at the arguments in the proof yields necessity.

Proof of Proposition 12. We start by showing with a case distinction that there
is a k ∈ {k0, k0 + 1, . . . , k0 + 8} such that

k ≡j√kk

(mod 8) and j√kk < √k.

(8)

Secondly, we consider the case that i 6= 0.

To this end, let i such that ⌊√k0⌋ ≡ k0 + i (mod 8) and 0 ≤ i ≤ 7.
Firstly, let us assume that i = 0. If k0 is not a square, then k = k0 satis-
ﬁes (8). Otherwise k = k0 + 8 satisﬁes (8) as k0 ≥ 4 > 1, and consequently
⌊√k0 + 8⌋ = √k0.
If ⌊√k0 + i⌋ = ⌊√k0⌋, then
k = k0 + i satisﬁes ⌊√k0⌋ ≡ k (mod 8) and √k > √k0 ≥ ⌊√k0⌋ = ⌊√k⌋,
which shows (8). If, on the other hand, ⌊√k0 + i⌋ >(cid:4)√k0(cid:5), then ⌊√k0 + i⌋ =
⌊√k0⌋ + 1 = ⌊√k0 + i + 1⌋ as k0 ≥ 4. Set k = k0 + i + 1. By choice of i, we
√k⌋ ≡ k (mod 8) as desired.
have ⌊√k0 + 1⌋ ≡ k (mod 8). Thus, we obtain ⌊
Moreover, √k > √k0 + i ≥ ⌊√k0 + i⌋ = ⌊√k0⌋ + 1 = ⌊

√k⌋.

In all cases an element of {k0, k0 + 1, . . . , k0 + 8} satisﬁes (8).
Next we show that for any n ≥ 4k, there is a graph G of treewidth k whose

degree sequence (degG(v1), degG(v2), . . . , degG(vn)) equals

(k, k + 1, . . . , ∆ − 1, ∆, . . . , ∆, ∆ − 1, . . . , k + 1, k)

(9)

with ∆ = k +⌊√k⌋. A computation similar to Lemma 4 shows that G is overfull
if |V (G)| is odd.
We construct G in three steps. First we take a power of a path, where all
but the outer vertices have the right degree. We increase the degree of the
outer vertices by connecting them to vertices towards the middle of the path.
This will create some degree excess for the used vertices. We balance this by
deleting a subgraph H provided by Lemma 13. The construction is illustrated
in Figure 1. Note that for ease of exposition the parameters k and ∆ are not as
in this proof.

Figure 1: Extreme example for k = 8 and ∆ = 10. The graph H is dotted.

Let P be a ∆/2-th power of a path on vertices v1, . . . , vn. This means, vi
and vj are adjacent if and only if 0 < |i − j| ≤ ∆/2. As P is symmetric, and
as G will be symmetric as well, we concentrate on the part of P on the vertices
v1, . . . , v⌈n/2⌉. We tacitly agree that any additions and deletions of edges are
also applied to the other half of P .

Comparing the degrees of P to (9) we see that all vertices have the target
degree except for the initial vertices v1, . . . , v∆/2, whose degree is too small.
For i = 1, . . . , ∆ − k the vertex vi has degree ∆/2 − 1 + i but should have
degree k − 1 + i. We ﬁx this by connecting vi to vi+∆/2+1, . . . , vi+k+1. For i =
∆−k+1, . . . , ∆/2, the vertex vi should have degree ∆ but has degree ∆/2−1+i.
We make vi adjacent to each of vi+∆/2+1, . . . , v∆+1.
Denote the obtained graph by P ′ and observe that its vertices in the range

G of the desired degree sequence. Note that for any two adjacent vertices vi,

vj in P ′ it holds that |i − j| ≤ k. This implies that P ′ is a subgraph of a k-th
power of a path. Thus the subgraph G of P ′ has treewidth at most k. This
ﬁnishes the proof.

To prove Lemma 13 we use the Erd˝os-Gallai-criterion:

Theorem 14 (Erd˝os and Gallai [7]). There is a graph with degree sequence

i=1 di is even and if for all ℓ = 1, . . . , n

d1 ≥ ··· ≥ dn if and only if Pn

di ≤ ℓ(ℓ − 1) +

min(di, ℓ).

(11)

Proof of Lemma 13. We check the conditions of Theorem 14 for the degree se-
quence d. The parity condition holds as 4 divides c(2r + c + 1) and

di = cr +

c(c + 1)

(2r + c + 1).

Let of us now verify (11). If ℓ > c, then

di ≤ cℓ ≤ ℓ(ℓ − 1) ≤ ℓ(ℓ − 1) +

min(di, ℓ).

Thus we can assume that ℓ ≤ c. Two remarks: Firstly, min(di, ℓ) = ℓ for
i = 1, . . . ,≤ c + r − ℓ + 1. Consequently, if 2ℓ ≤ c + r then

ℓ(ℓ − 1) +

Secondly, if ℓ > r, then

Now suppose that 2ℓ ≤ c+r. For ℓ ≤ r, we havePℓ
i=1 di = cℓ and hence (11)
is easily seen to be satisﬁed in light of (12). On the other hand, for ℓ > r the
assumption of r2 ≥ c together with a comparison of (12) and (13) gives (11).
So let 2ℓ > c + r. This implies that ℓ > r. Consequently, the right hand side
of (11) is

2 (r2 + r).

It follows from equation (13) that (11) is satisﬁed if the following expression is
non-negative.

2ℓ(ℓ − 1) + (c + r − ℓ)(c + r − ℓ + 1) − (2cℓ + ℓ(2r + 1 − ℓ) − (r2 + r))
= 4ℓ2 − 4ℓ(c + r) + (c + r)2 + (c + 2r + r2) − 4ℓ
= (2ℓ − (c + r))2 + (c + r) + (r + r2) − 4ℓ
(cid:17)
= (2ℓ − (c + r))2 − 2(cid:16)2ℓ −

(c + r) + (r + r2)

2

First, let r2 = c. Then (14) equals

(2ℓ − (c + r))2 − 2(2ℓ − (c + r))

(14)

(15)

The term (15) is negative only if 2ℓ − (c + r) = 1. As c + r = r2 + r is even (for
any integer r), (15) and thus (14) is non-negative.
Now let r2 > c. Then (14) is strictly greater than (15) and hence non-

negative. This shows that (11) is satisﬁed.

As (11) holds for all ℓ, there is a graph with degree sequence d.

6 Degenerate graphs

Recall that a graph G is k-degenerate if there is an enumeration vn, . . . , v1 of
the vertices such that vi+1 has degree at most k in G − {vn, . . . , vi} for every i.
By simple induction following the elimination order we can obtain a bound with
half the degree loss of (1):

2|E(G)| ≤ ∆|V (G)| − 1

2 (∆ − k)(∆ − k + 1).

(16)

The bound in (16) turns out to be tight for some ∆, k as the construction
below shows. Consequently, Proposition 3 can easily be transferred: Any simple

k-degenerate graph of maximum degree ∆ ≥ k + 1/2 +p2k + 1/4 is not overfull

and therefore has fractional chromatic index χ′

Consider a positive integer p and let Gp be the complement of the disjoint
union of p stars K1,1, K1,2, . . . , K1,p; see Figure 6. Denote the centre of the
ith star by vi, and let W be the union of all leaves. The graph Gp has n =
p(p + 1)/2 + p vertices and satisﬁes deg(vi) = n − 1 − i for i = 1, . . . , p and
deg(w) = n−2 for w ∈ W . In particular, the maximum degree of Gp is ∆ = n−2.
Setting k = n−1−p, we note that Gp is k-degenerate as vp, vp−1, . . . , v1 followed
by an arbitrary enumeration of W is an elimination order. Finally, we observe
that Gp satisﬁes (16) with equality.

f (G) = ∆.
