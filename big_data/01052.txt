SPECTRAL ANALYSIS OF NON-SELF-ADJOINT JACOBI OPERATOR

ASSOCIATED WITH JACOBIAN ELLIPTIC FUNCTIONS

PETR SIEGL AND FRANTIˇSEK ˇSTAMPACH

Abstract. We perform the spectral analysis of a family of Jacobi operators J(α) de-
If |α| (cid:54)= 1 the spectrum of J(α) is discrete and
pending on a complex parameter α.
formulas for eigenvalues and eigenvectors are established in terms of elliptic integrals and
Jacobian elliptic functions. If |α| = 1, α (cid:54)= ±1, the essential spectrum of J(α) covers
the entire complex plane.
In addition, a formula for the Weyl m-function as well as
the asymptotic expansions of solutions of the diﬀerence equation corresponding to J(α)
are obtained. Finally, the completeness of eigenvectors and Rodriguez-like formulas for
orthogonal polynomials, studied previously by Carlitz, are proved.

1. Introduction

We investigate spectral properties of a one-parameter family of Jacobi operators J(α),
α ∈ C, acting in (cid:96)2(N), with emphasis on obtaining the spectral results in the most explicit
form. The operator J(α) is determined by the semi-inﬁnite Jacobi matrix J (α) whose
diagonal vanishes and oﬀ-diagonal sequence {wn}n∈N is given by

Thus, with respect to the standard basis of (cid:96)2(N), the matrix J (α) is of the form

The operator J(α) is self-adjoint if and only if α ∈ R. We focus mainly on the non-self-
adjoint case with a general α ∈ C, although we restrict ourselves to |α| ≤ 1 in the body
of the paper. For |α| > 1, the spectral analysis is in all aspects very similar and the main
results for this case, omitting the detailed proofs, are summarized in the last section.

We investigate the localization of essential spectrum and eigenvalues, asymptotic proper-
ties of eigenvectors, their completeness and possible basisness. It turns out that the operator
J(α) constitutes one of not many concrete unbounded non-self-adjoint operators whose spec-
tral properties can be described explicitly and, in addition, whose spectrum is entirely real
for a certain (non-real) range of parameter α. Furthermore, the Jacobi matrix J (α) belongs
to the class with periodically modulated unbounded weights, where the so-called spectral
phase transition phenomena has been observed [15, 20, 25], see also [16], however, all in the
self-adjoint setting. To our best knowledge, J(α) is the ﬁrst instance of a non-self-adjoint
Jacobi operator with the transition property, namely with a sudden and complete change of
the spectral character when the parameter α crosses the unit circle.

The vast literature on speciﬁc families of self-adjoint Jacobi operators shows that spectral
properties are usually closely related with special functions. In our case, the major role is
played by elliptic integrals and Jacobian elliptic functions, where the parameter α enters as a
(complex) modulus. Moreover, the spectral analysis of a Jacobi operator can be reformulated
to the study of speciﬁc properties of corresponding family of orthogonal polynomials, see [2].

The family associated with J (α) does not belong to the Askey-scheme, which can serve, see
[17], as a rich source of Jacobi operators with explicitly solvable spectral problem, however,
it was studied before by Carlitz in [7, 8] for α ∈ (0, 1).
In Section 2, we introduce the unique closed and densely deﬁned Jacobi operator J(α)
associated with the matrix J (α) and derive some of its fundamental properties relying on
general theorems of spectral and perturbation theory for linear operators. It is shown that
the residual spectrum of J(α) is empty, the resolvent of J(α) is compact if |α| < 1, and, on
the other hand, the essential spectrum of J(α) is non-empty if |α| = 1.
Section 3 is devoted to the self-adjoint case, i.e., for α ∈ R. We start with a simple
algebraic identity, which might be deduced from a continued fraction formula going back to
Stieltjes, and obtain a formula for the Fourier transform of the spectral measure. This yields
the spectrum of J(α) immediately. Moreover, a suitably applied Laplace transform enables
us to derive the Mittag-Leﬄer expansion for the Weyl m-function.
Main results are derived within Section 4 where the non-self-adjoint case is treated. If
|α| < 1, we obtain expressions for eigenvalues of J(α), integral formulas for eigenvectors and
their asymptotic expansions for the index going to inﬁnity. Moreover, the set of eigenvectors
is shown to be complete in (cid:96)2(N). For |α| = 1 and α (cid:54)= ±1, we prove by constructing
singular sequences that the essential spectrum of J(α) coincides with entire C. In addition, a
Rodriguez-like formula for the associated orthogonal polynomials is derived as well as certain
generating function formulas for quantities closely related to eigenvectors. The question
whether the set of eigenvectors forms the Riesz (or Schauder) basis remains open, nonetheless,
the authors incline to the negative answer. A numerical analysis of pseudospectra, supporting
the opinion, is presented and a formula for the norm of eigenprojections, which might be
useful in excluding the basisness of eigenvectors, is established.
Finally, Section 5 contains a brief summary of corresponding results for |α| > 1 and the

paper is concluded by Appendix on selected properties of Jacobian elliptic functions.

2. General properties of J(α)

Recall that, within the standard construction of a linear operator associated with matrix
J (α), one deﬁnes the couple of operators Jmin(α) and Jmax(α), see, for example, [4, Sec. 2].
In more detail, for x ∈ (cid:96)2(N), which is to be understood as semi-inﬁnite column vector in
the following, J (α)x is given by the formal matrix multiplication. The minimal operator
Jmin(α) is deﬁned as the operator closure of an auxiliary operator J0(α),
J0(α)x = J (α)x, Dom(J0(α)) = span{en | n ∈ N},

where en stands for the nth vector of the standard basis of (cid:96)2(N); J0(α) can be shown to be
always closable. The maximal operator Jmax(α) is deﬁned as

Jmax(α)x = J (α)x, Dom(Jmax(α)) =(cid:8)x ∈ (cid:96)2(N) | Jmax(α)x ∈ (cid:96)2(N)(cid:9).

Clearly, Jmin(α) ⊂ Jmax(α), however, Jmin(α) = Jmax(α) in our case. This equality is
guaranteed by Carleman’s suﬃcient condition [4, Ex. 2.7]:

which holds for wn given by (1) if α (cid:54)= 0. In addition, one has Jmin(α)∗ = Jmax(α) for all
α ∈ C. The situation for α = 0 is somewhat special but trivial and the equality Jmin(0) =
Jmax(0) remains true as well. Thus, the subscripts min and max can be omitted and the
unique Jacobi operator determined by J (α) is denoted by J(α).

Let us summarize these facts in the following proposition.

Proposition 1. For all α ∈ C, Jacobi matrix (2) determines the unique unbounded Jacobi
operator J(α), for which it holds J(α)∗ = J(α). Consequently, operator J(α) is C-self-
adjoint, i.e. J(α)∗ = CJ(α)C, where C is the complex conjugation operator on (cid:96)2(N).

In the next corollary, we summarize several general spectral properties of J(α) that follow
immediately from its C-self-adjointness, see e.g. [11, Sec. III.5, IX.1, Thm. IX.1.6] and [6,
Cor. 2.1]. Notice that there are several deﬁnitions of essential spectra for non-self-adjoint

operators, here we follow the notations of [11, Sec. IX.1]. In this paper, we work with σe2,
which can be characterized by singular sequences, see [11, Def. IX.1.2, Thm. IX.1.3].
Corollary 2. For all α ∈ C, the residual part of the spectrum of J(α) is empty and four
deﬁnitions of essential spectra (see [11, Sec. IX.1]) coincide, namely

σe1(J(α)) = σe2(J(α)) = σe3(J(α)) = σe4(J(α)).

Note that operators J(α) and J(−α) are unitarily equivalent via the unitary operator U =
diag(1, 1,−1,−1, 1, 1,−1,−1, . . . ). Hence, if spectral properties of J(α) are investigated, the
range of α can be restricted to a half-plane, for example Re α ≥ 0.

Next, J(α) has a compact resolvent if |α| < 1, but it is not the case if |α| = 1.

Proposition 3. The following statements hold true.

i) If |α| < 1, then 0 ∈ ρ(J(α)) and J(α)−1 is a Hilbert-Schmidt operator.
ii) If |α| = 1, then 0 ∈ σe2(J(α)).

Proof. The veriﬁcation of the statement (i) is trivial for α = 0. Further we assume α (cid:54)= 0.

thus 0 ∈ σe2(J(α)).

(cid:3)
For |α| < 1, the operator J(α) can be viewed as a perturbation of J(0) with the relative

bound smaller than 1. For later purposes we formulate the following lemma.
Lemma 4. Let α ∈ C, |α| < 1. Then

(i) for every ε > 0, there exists C(ε) > 0 such that, for all u ∈ Dom(J(0)),

(cid:107)(J(α) − J(0))u(cid:107) ≤ (1 + ε)|α|(cid:107)J(0)u(cid:107) + C(ε)(cid:107)u(cid:107),

(9)
(ii) for every r ∈ (0, 1), there exists a non-empty open set Zr ⊂ C with Zr ∩ R = ∅ such
that, for all z ∈ Zr and all α ∈ Br(0), (J(α) − z)−1 exists and it is a holomorphic
bounded-operator-valued function of α on Br(0).

Proof. Let α (cid:54)= 0 and denote by M the operator 1
of α. For every u ∈ Dom(J(0)),

α (J(α)−J(0)); notice that M is independent

On the other hand, for every u ∈ Dom(J(0)),

By putting (10), (11) together and using Young inequality, we obtain the statement (i).

| Im z| for z /∈ R. Further, for any z /∈ R and u ∈ (cid:96)2(N), we have from

(cid:107)J(0)(J(0) − z)−1(cid:107) ≤ |z|
(9) that

(cid:107)αM (J(0) − z)−1u(cid:107) ≤ (1 + ε)|α|(cid:107)J(0)(J(0) − z)−1u(cid:107) + C(ε)(cid:107)(J(0) − z)−1u(cid:107)

where ε > 0 is arbitrary. If r < 1, then we can clearly select ε > 0 such that (1 + ε)r < 1.
Therefore there exists a non-empty open set Zr ⊂ C with Zr ∩ R = ∅ such that, for all
α ∈ Br(0) and all z ∈ Zr,

(cid:107)αM (J(0) − z)−1(cid:107) < 1.

Hence we have the standard representation of resolvent of J(α) based on Neumann series

3. The self-adjoint case

(13)

(cid:3)

In this section, we analyze the spectral properties of J(α) for 0 ≤ α ≤ 1. Some of the
following results may be deduced from the properties of orthogonal polynomials studied in
[7, §§ 7]. Here we provide an independent brief derivation based exclusively on techniques
developed for spectral analysis of Jacobi operators, see [27].

which goes back to Stieltjes, see [26]. This identity is to be understood as the equality
between two elements of the ring of formal power series in the indeterminate z. The formal
power series for the formal Laplace transform on the LHS of (14) equals

(cid:0)α2(cid:1) z2n,

(−1)nC2n

∞(cid:88)

n=0

as one deduces with the aid of (47). On the other hand, the coeﬃcients of power series
associated to the Stieltjes continued fraction on the RHS of (14) is known to be expressible
in terms of the ﬁrst diagonal element of an integer power of the Jacobi matrix J (α). This
can be deduced, for example, from the Stieltjes’ Expansion Theorem [30, Thm. 53.1]; see
also [12] for more details. Namely, the RHS of (14) equals

(−1)n(cid:0)J (α)2n(cid:1)

∞(cid:88)

n=0

In addition, since the diagonal of J (α) vanishes, one has(cid:0)J (α)2n+1(cid:1)

1,1 z2n.

Consequently, formula (14) yields identities

(cid:104)e1, J(α)2n+1e1(cid:105) = 0,

(cid:104)e1, J(α)2ne1(cid:105) = C2n

(15)
3.2. Spectrum in the case 0 ≤ α ≤ 1. According to equalities (47) and (15), function
cn(z, α) can be written as

(cid:0)α2(cid:1) , n ∈ N0, α ∈ C.

Deﬁne µ(·) := (cid:104)e1, EJ (·)e1(cid:105) where EJ stands for the spectral measure of the self-adjoint
operator J(α). Then, by the Spectral theorem, we have

cn(z, α) =

PETR SIEGL AND FRANTIˇSEK ˇSTAMPACH

Since the power series of cn(z, α) converges absolutely for |z| < π/2, Fubini’s theorem justiﬁes
the interchange of the sum and the integral and, with the help of (15), we get

(cid:90)

(16)

eixzdµ(x) = cn(z, α),
which is true in the circle |z| < π/2. Nevertheless, since
ea|x|dµ(x) < ∞

(cid:90)

R

for all 0 < a < π/2, the LHS of (16) is a function analytic in the strip | Im z| < π/2 and
formula (16) remains true for all z ∈ C, | Im z| < π/2. One can show that the largest strip
where (16) holds is in fact | Im z| < K(cid:48)(α).
The LHS of (16) is nothing but the Fourier transform of µ, i.e., F[µ](z) = cn(z, α), where
the measure µ is identiﬁed with the corresponding tempered distribution. Consequently, by
the inverse Fourier transform to the function cn(z, α), we recover the spectral measure µ.

Recall that, in the distributional sense, one has

F−1 [cos(ax)] (t) =

(δ(t − a) + δ(t + a)) ,

a, t ∈ R.

The measure µ coincides with the measure of orthogonality of polynomials studied by Carlitz
and the above formula is in agreement with results of [7, §§ 7]. Since the support of the
measure µ coincide with the spectrum of J(α), we get

σ (J(α)) =

2K(α)

the special case α = 0, for which K(0) = π/2, can be veriﬁed directly.

If α = 1, then cn(z, 1) = 1/ cosh(z). Recall that

x = (φ1(x), φ2(x), . . . ), then J(1)ϕx = xϕx for all x ∈ R and

Consequently, one can introduce the unitary mapping U : (cid:96)2(N) → L2(R, dx) by setting
U en := φn, for all n ∈ N. Then, clearly

Thus, J(1) is unitarily equivalent to the multiplication operator by the independent variable
acting on L2(R, dx). Consequently, we have again σ(J(1)) = σac(J(1)) = R.
3.3. Weyl m-function in the case 0 < α ≤ 1. Recall the Weyl m-function of Jacobi
operator J(α) is deﬁned as

m(z, α) = (cid:104)e1, (J(α) − z)−1e1(cid:105),

z ∈ C, Im z (cid:54)= 0.

(18)

We derive an explicit formula for the m-function, in fact its Mittag-Leﬄer expansion. The
proof relies on the identity (16) and the well-known relation for a self-adjoint operator A in
a Hilbert space H, see e.g.
[22, Eq. (VIII.9)] or [5, Chp. 5, Prob. 31.(b)], namely, for all

and if α = 1, then we have

where ψ stands for the digamma function.

Proof. It follows from (18) and the self-adjointness of J(α) that m(¯z, α) = m(z, α), thus it
suﬃces to consider z with Im z > 0. From (19) and (16), one gets

m(iz, α) = iL[cn(t, α)](z), Re z > 0, α ∈ (0, 1],

where L denotes the Laplace transform.

as expected. The last equality is the Mittag-Leﬄer expansion of the hyperbolic secant.

4.1. The case |α| < 1. First we extend the formula (20) for the Weyl m-function for |α| < 1.

4. The non-self-adjoint case

Proposition 8. The formula (20) for the Weyl m-function of J(α) remains valid for 0 <
|α| < 1 and z ∈ ρ(J(α)).

Proof. Let us temporarily denote the RHS of (20) by ML(z, α). Recall ﬁrst that K and q are
analytic non-constant functions on the set C \ ((−∞,−1] ∪ [1,∞)), which is proved within
the theory of elliptic functions, see [9, Chp. 7,§ 8] and also [29, Sec. 4]. Moreover, |q| < 1
for all α ∈ C \ ((−∞,−1] ∪ [1,∞)). Consequently, ML(z,·) is a meromorphic function on
C \ ((−∞,−1] ∪ [1,∞)).
Take r ∈ (0, 1). By Lemma 4.(ii), we known that there exists a non-empty open set Zr ⊂ C
such that the function α (cid:55)→ (J(α)− z)−1 is analytic on Br(0) for all z ∈ Zr. Hence the same
holds true for the m-function m(z,·). Since, for z ∈ Zr, the equality m(z, α) = ML(z, α),
i.e. an equality between two meromorphic functions in α, holds true for all α ∈ (0, 1), it
has to remain valid for all α ∈ Br(0). Hence, m(z, α) = ML(z, α) for all α ∈ Br(0) and all
z ∈ Zr.
At the same time, both functions m(·, α) and ML(·, α) are analytic in the set ρ(J(α)) ∩

2K(α) (2Z + 1)(cid:1). So the equality m(z, α) = ML(z, α) remains true on this domain for

(cid:0)C \

π

z, by the analyticity argument in z.

Notice that function m(·, α) has singularities points z ∈ π

2K(α) (2Z + 1). Thus, since the
2K(α) (2Z + 1) ⊂ σ(J(α)). All in all,
m-function is analytic on the resolvent set, we have
we get the equality m(z, α) = ML(z, α) for all α ∈ Br(0) and all z ∈ ρ(J(α)). Since r is an
arbitrary number smaller than 1, the last claim can be extended to all α with |α| < 1. (cid:3)

π

Recall that in the case of Jacobi operators with compact resolvent (non-self-adjoint in
general), the Weyl m-function is a meromorphic function and the set of its poles coincides
with the spectrum of the Jacobi operator.
In addition, the algebraic multiplicity of an
eigenvalue is the same as the order of the pole, see [3, Thm. 5.3, Cor. 5.5]. The following
statement follows immediately from Proposition 8 and the formula (20). The claim holds
true also for α = 0, as one readily veriﬁes recalling that K(0) = π/2.
Theorem 9. Let |α| < 1, then

where

σ (J(α)) = σp (J(α)) = {λN}N∈Z,

λN =

π

2K(α)

(2N + 1), N ∈ Z.

(23)

In addition, all λN are simple, i.e. have the algebraic multiplicity equal to one. In particular,
if Re α = 0, then σ (J(α)) ⊂ R.

k ∈ N0.

(24)

The integration is carried out trough the line segment in C connecting points 0 and 2K(α).
Integrals in (24) are well deﬁned for any α ∈ C \ ((−∞,−1] ∪ [1,∞)) since functions
sn(uK(α), α), cn(uK(α), α) and dn(uK(α), α) are analytic in u ∈ R. For our purposes,
it is suﬃcient to restrict α on the unit disk |α| ≤ 1 and exclude the boundary points α = ±1.
Before we proceed with the further spectral analysis of J(α), we investigate the asymptotic
behavior of Ck and Dk as k → ∞. The integral form of the deﬁnition formulas (24) is
suitable for the application of the saddle point method. However, some knowledge on values
| sn(uK(α), α)| for u ∈ [0, 2] and |α| ≤ 1 is necessary. The needed property is stated in the
following lemma, proved in a separate paper [24] devoted entirely to properties of function
α (cid:55)→ sn(uK(α), α) for complex α.
Lemma 10 ([24]). Let |α| ≤ 1 and α (cid:54)= ±1, then
|sn (uK(α), α)| < 1,

(25)
Hence, taking into account that sn(K(α), α) = 1 and sn(2K(α)−z, α) = sn(z, α), the function
u (cid:55)→ |sn (uK(α), α)|, restricted to the interval (0, 2), has the unique global maximum at u = 1
with the value equal to 1.
Proposition 11. Let |α| ≤ 1, α (cid:54)= ±1 and z ∈ C, then

∀u ∈ [0, 1).

with 0 < p < 1. On the other hand, on a suﬃciently small neighborhood of K(α) where
log sn(t, α) is analytic, we apply the saddle point method following [21]. This yields k−1/2
or k−3/2 leading terms, thus the exponentially small term (27) can be neglected.
In the
notation of [21, Sec. 4.7, Thm. 7.1], we have

p(K(α)) = 0,

p(cid:48)(cid:48)(K(α)) = 1 − α2,

and, denoting by qC, qD the corresponding functions q for Ck, Dk, respectively,

p(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48)(K(α)) = 0

C(K(α)) = 2ze−zK(α)(cid:112)

1 − α2,

qC(K(α)) = 0,

qD(K(α)) = e−zK(α)(cid:112)

1 − α2,

thus we receive the asymptotic formulas (26).

As showed in the following lemma, Ck and Dk satisfy certain diﬀerence equations and are

closely related to the eigenvectors of J(α).
Lemma 12. Let |α| ≤ 1, α (cid:54)= ±1, then, for all z ∈ C, one has

−zD0 − α2C1 = e−2K(α)z − 1,
−zC0 − D1 = −e−2K(α)z − 1,

kCk−1 − zDk − α2(k + 1)Ck+1 = 0,

kDk−1 − zCk − (k + 1)Dk+1 = 0, k ∈ N.

is the solution of the system of equations

u2 − zu1 = −2 cos(K(α)z),

(2k + 1)u2k+2 − zu2k+1 + 2kαu2k = 0,
2kαu2k+1 − zu2k + (2k − 1)u2k−1 = 0,

k ∈ N,

or equivalently

J (α)u = zu − 2 cos(K(α)z)e1,

z ∈ C.

(30)

Proof. We obtain (28) by integrating (24) by parts, appealing to the derivative formulas (58)
and using the identities (52) as well as the special values (51). The second statement follows
(cid:3)
immediately from equations (29) and (28).

Finally, we ﬁnd the eigenvectors of J(α).

Proposition 13. Let 0 < |α| < 1 and let {λN}N∈Z be the simple eigenvalues of J(α), cf.
(23). Then the eigenvectors of J(α) corresponding to the eigenvalues {λN}N∈Z read
k ∈ N0,

2k+2 := (−1)k+1αkD2k+1 (iλN , α) ,
v(N )

2k+1 := i(−1)kαkC2k (iλN , α) ,
v(N )

(31)

(32)

Proof. Since v(N ) = e−iK(α)λN u, the second claim follows from Proposition 11. Moreover,
0 (cid:54)= v(N ) ∈ (cid:96)2(N). Since cos(K(α)λN ) = 0, equation (30) yields J(α)v(N ) = λN v(N ).
(cid:3)
We conclude this subsection by showing the completeness of {v(N )}N∈Z in (cid:96)2(N).

Proposition 14. Let |α| < 1, then the set of eigenvectors {v(N )}N∈Z of J(α), deﬁned in
(31), is complete in (cid:96)2(N).
Proof. The proof is based on [10, Cor. XI.9.31] and the fact that {λN}N∈Z are simple, see
Theorem 9.

It follows from (12) and (13) that there exist c(α), δ(α) > 0 such that

(cid:107)(J(α) − z)−1(cid:107) ≤ C < ∞,

|z| > c(α) and || arg z| − π/2| < δ(α).

Moreover, from Proposition 5, (J(0) − z)−1 ∈ Sp for every p > 1, thus by (13) and the ideal
property of Schatten classes, we obtain that (J(α) − z)−1 ∈ Sp for every p > 1 as well. (cid:3)
4.3. The case |α| = 1. While σ(J(α)) is discrete for |α| < 1, i.e., a set of isolated points in
C, it suddenly ﬁlls the entire complex plane if |α| = 1, α (cid:54)= ±1.
Theorem 15. Let |α| = 1 and α (cid:54)= ±1. Then

σ(J(α)) = σe2(J(α)) = C.

Proof. We proceed analogously to the proof of the second claim in Proposition 3, however,
we begin with the sequence u deﬁned in (29), use that u satisﬁes (30) and that we know the
asymptotic behavior of Ck and Dk, as stated in Proposition 11.

Take arbitrary z ∈ C. We deﬁne a family of sequences u(a), a ∈ (0, 1), by putting

un(a) = anun, n ∈ N,

where un is as in (29). By Proposition 11, one has

By putting (33), (34) and (35) together, we obtain

thus z ∈ σe2(J(α)) by [11, Thm. IX.1.3].
Remark 16. The asymptotic formulas (32) have been derived as a direct consequence of
Proposition 11, thus they remain valid also for |α| = 1, α (cid:54)= ±1. For such α, one observes
that v(N ) /∈ (cid:96)2(N). Consequently, since the solution of the diﬀerence equations J (α)u = zu
is unique up to a multiplicative constant, we get that {λN}N∈Z, deﬁned as in (23), are not
eigenvalues of J(α).

4.4. Other properties of eigenvectors. In this subsection, we provide some additional
results related to eigenvectors of J(α) for |α| < 1. Namely, we derive a generating function
formula for eigenvectors, give a Rodriguez-like identity for orthogonal polynomials associated
with Jacobi matrix J (α) and present an integral formula for the norm of eigenprojections.
Note that formulas for v(N ) given in Proposition 13 are expressible in terms of Fourier

coeﬃcients of some analytic functions. Indeed, let us put

the formulas there are treated rather as formal series, no comment on the convergence is
given and 0 < α < 1 is assumed.

It would be interesting to know whether the set of eigenvectors {v(N )}N∈Z forms a basis
of (cid:96)2(N), or not. From this point of view, it is useful to have some knowledge on the norm of
the eigenprojections {QN}N∈Z corresponding to the eigenvalues {λN}N∈Z. Designating the
dependence on α in the eigenvectors by writing v(N ) = v(N )(α) and observing that v(N )(α)
is the eigenvector of J∗(α) corresponding to the eigenvalue λN , we have that

(44)

QN =

Since v(N )(α) = −v(N )(α), one obtains

Corollary 20 enable us to derive an integral formula for (cid:107)QN(cid:107), nevertheless, it does not give
a complete answer on the behavior of (cid:107)QN(cid:107) yet as ﬁnding an asymptotic formula for (cid:107)v(N )(cid:107)
as N → ∞ seems to be a not easy task.

We conclude by comparing numerics of pseudospectrum of J(α) for α = 0.5 and α = 0.5i,
see Figure 1. The plots are computed in Mathematica as the log of the norm of the inverse of
J(α) − z truncated to 200 × 200 matrix. Although all eigenvalues are real in both cases, the
pseudospectra have completely diﬀerent character and they suggest that the eigenvectors of
J(α) for non-real α, |α| < 1, do not form a Riesz basis (as otherwise the ε-pseudospectrum
should be contained in a κε-neighborhood of eigenvalues with some κ > 0, see, e.g., [18]).

Figure 1. Pseudospectra of J(α) for α = 0.5 (up) and α = 0.5i (down).

5. The case |α| > 1

For the sake of completeness, we describe the spectral properties of the Jacobi operator
J(α) also in the case when |α| > 1. However, the analysis is very similar to the case |α| < 1,
therefore we provide only ﬁnal formulas omitting detailed derivations.

In fact, the problem is reformulated using the operator ˜J(β) associated with Jacobi matrix

˜J (β) := α−1J (α),

β := α−1.

(45)

Hence, if |α| > 1, then 0 < |β| < 1 and operator ˜J(β) has discrete spectrum.

Taking (45) together with (15) one obtains identities
(cid:104)e1, ˜J(β)2ne1(cid:105) = β2nC2n

(cid:104)e1, ˜J(β)2n+1e1(cid:105) = 0,

(cid:0)β−2(cid:1) , n ∈ N0, β ∈ C \ {0}.

Thus, for 0 < β < 1 and taking into account (48), one derives the analogue of (16), namely

where ˜µ(·) := (cid:104)e1, E ˜J (·)e1(cid:105) where E ˜J stands for the spectral measure of ˜J(β). The application
of the inverse Fourier transform and the formula (50) then yields

For the sequence of polynomials ˜p = {˜pn}n∈N satisfying the eigenvalue equation ˜J (β)˜p(x) =

Appendix: Jacobian elliptic functions

Jacobian elliptic functions are deeply investigated and very well-known. For convenience,
some of their selected properties, which are used within the paper, are summarized here. As
a primarily source we use [19], other useful references are [1, Chp. 16], [23] and [2].

The (copolar) triplet of Jacobian elliptic functions sn(u, α), cn(u, α) and dn(u, α) can be
deﬁned with the aid of Jacobi’s theta functions, see [19, Eqs. (2.1.1-3)] (modulus α coincides
with k in the Lawden’s notation). Each of these functions is meromorphic in u (for ﬁxed
α) with simple poles and simple zeros and is meromorphic in α (for ﬁxed u).
In most
applications, the range for the modulus α is restricted to 0 < α < 1. As such, all three
function are real-valued for u ∈ R.

Taylor series expansions of Jacobian elliptic functions can be written in the form:

Expansions (46), (47) and (48) are absolutely convergent for |α| ≤ 1 and |u| < π/2, see [29,
Thm. 3.2]. For n ∈ N, Cn(x) is a polynomial in x of degree (cid:98)(n− 1)/2(cid:99) with positive integer
coeﬃcients. No explicit formula for polynomials Cn is known, although a lot of authors
studied them and found various combinatorial interpretations for their coeﬃcients. Let us
mention at least [13, 28]. Polynomials Cn may be computed recursively by formulas

where the principle square root is used. As function of α2, K is analytic in C \ [1,∞). Note
that K(α) > 0 whenever α2 < 1. The conjugate elliptic integral K(cid:48) is deﬁned as K(cid:48)(α) =
K(α(cid:48)) where the complementary modulus α(cid:48) satisﬁes α2 + α(cid:48)2 = 1. Similarly, as function of
α2, K(cid:48) is analytic in C \ (−∞, 0]. Finally, recall the nome q(α) = exp(−πK(cid:48)(α)/K(α)); the
dependence on the modulus α is suppressed in the notation for q. Note that all functions
sn, cn, dn, K, K(cid:48) and q are functions of α2 rather then α.
