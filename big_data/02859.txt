Understanding the relation between planned and realized ﬂight trajectories and the determinants
of ﬂight deviations is of great importance in air traﬃc management.
In this paper we perform
an in-depth investigation of the statistical properties of planned and realized air traﬃc on the
German airspace during a 28 day periods, corresponding to an AIRAC cycle. We ﬁnd that realized
trajectories are on average shorter than planned ones and this eﬀect is stronger during night-time
than day-time. Flights are more frequently deviated close to the departure airport and at a relatively
large angle-to-destination. Moreover, the probability of a deviation is higher in low traﬃc phases.
All these evidences indicate that deviations are mostly used by controllers to give directs to ﬂights
when traﬃc conditions allow it. Finally we introduce a new metric, termed di-fork, which is able
to characterize navigation points according to the likelihood that a deviation occurs there. Di-fork
allows to identify in a statistically rigorous way navigation point pairs where deviations are more
(less) frequent than expected under a null hypothesis of randomness that takes into account the
heterogeneity of the navigation points. Such pairs can therefore be seen as sources of ﬂexibility
(stability) of controllers traﬃc management while conjugating safety and eﬃciency.

INTRODUCTION

In the recent literature it is possible to ﬁnd many examples where network science has been applied to the air
transportation system (for a review, see [1, 2]). Many studies have focused on the topological aspect of the airport
network [3–14], but network science techniques can also be used to study topics more related to air traﬃc management
[15–25]. In particular, one can consider diﬀerent elements of the airspace like sectors and navigation points and build
networks which are informative about the air traﬃc management [26]. In fact, diﬀerently than the airport network,
navigation point networks are more related to air traﬃc management problems and to safety issues.

Here we present a study of the air traﬃc management procedures controlling the ﬂow of ﬂights occurring on top of
the navigation point network. Navigation points are ﬁxed two dimensional points in the airspace speciﬁed by latitude
and longitude. The airlines must use this grid to plan each ﬂight trajectory from departure to destination. Navigation
points are also of reference for air traﬃc controllers who use them to solve conﬂicts and problems originated by
unforeseen events and to rationalize and decrease the complexity of the aircraft ﬂow. The navigation points can be
viewed as a guide for airlines, but also as a burden, because ﬂights cannot ﬂy straight and have to ﬁnd a path on this
predeﬁned grid. In fact, it is foreseen by the SESAR project [27] that navigation points will slowly disappear to allow
smooth trajectories, the so-called “business” trajectories. However, in the present air transportation system they are
crucial for air traﬃc controllers. In the present work we will focus on a quantitative assessment of their role in the
air traﬃc management.

In our study we investigate how the planned ﬂight trajectories are modiﬁed by controllers in relationship with
unforeseen events or pilots’ requests. Our study is based on a metric called directional-fork, or di-fork, comparing
planned ﬂight trajectories with deviated ﬂight trajectories. By using this metric we obtain a quantitative description
of the deviations of planned ﬂight trajectories called by air traﬃc controllers at the level of single navigation point
pairs. The activity of air traﬃc controllers usually concerns two main aspects: on one side they are responsible for
avoiding safety events and for making the aircraft trajectories conﬂict-free. On the other side, whenever possible,
they can issue directs that (i) shorten trajectories, thus allowing for lower fuel consumption, and (ii) can improve the
predictability of the system. In our investigations we show that directs are the main determinants for the probability
of ﬂight trajectory deviations.

We perform a statistical validation of the navigations point pairs by comparing the observed values of the di-fork
metric with the values expected under a null hypothesis of deviations occurring at randomly distributed navigation

point pairs. In other words, we investigate how the diﬀerent navigation points present in a given airspace are used by
air traﬃc controllers over the day. Speciﬁcally, we detect navigation point pairs where trajectories (i) are most likely
to be deviated with respect to the planned ones, thus providing a “destabilization” of the planned trajectory, or (ii)
are most likely not to be deviated with respect to the planned ones, thus providing a “stabilization” of the planned
trajectory.

The paper is organized as follows: in section II we describe the database used in our investigation. Section III deals
with the statistical investigation of planned ﬂight trajectories. Section IV focuses on the statistical properties of ﬂight
deviations observed from the planned ﬂight trajectories. Section V introduces the di-fork and the statistical validation
method used to detect a set of over-expressed and under-expressed navigation point pairs. Finally, in section VI we
draw our conclusions.

II. DATA

Our database contains information on all the ﬂights that, even partly, cross the ECAC airspace. Data are collected
by EUROCONTROL (http://www.eurocontrol.int), the European public institution that coordinates and plans air
traﬃc control for all Europe and were obtained as part of the SESAR Joint Undertaking WP-E research project ELSA
“Empirically grounded agent based model for the future ATM scenario”. 1

Data come from two diﬀerent sources. First, we have access to the Demand Data Repository (DDR) [28] database
containing all the trajectories followed by any aircraft in the ECAC airspace during 15 months – from the 8th of April
2010 to the 27th of June 2011. Each 28 day time period is termed AIRAC cycle. A planned or realized trajectory is
made by a sequence of navigation points crossed by the aircraft, together with altitudes and timestamps. The typical
time between two navigation points lies between 1 and 10 minutes, giving a good time resolution for trajectories. In
this paper we use the “last ﬁled ﬂight plans”, i.e. the so-called M1 ﬁles, which are the planned trajectories – ﬁled
from 6 months to one or two hours before the real departure. We also use the real trajectories, i.e. the so-called M3
ﬁles, because we will compare planned and realized trajectories in order to investigate the air traﬃc controllers role.
In our study we are considering commercial ﬂights. For this reason we have selected only scheduled ﬂights –
excluding, in particular, military ﬂights – using land-plane aircraft, i.e. no helicopter, gyrocopter, etc. This gives, in
ﬁrst approximation, the full set of commercial ﬂights. We also excluded all ﬂights having a duration shorter than 10
minutes and a few other ﬂights having obvious recording data errors.

The database includes all ﬂights in the enlarged ECAC airspace 2 even if they departed and/or landed in airports

external to the enlarged ECAC airspace.

The other source of information are the NEVAC ﬁles. NEVAC ﬁles [29] contain all the elements allowing the
deﬁnition (borders, altitude, relationships, time of opening and closing) of the elements of airspaces, namely airblocks,
sectors, airspaces (including Flight Information Region, National Airspace, Area Control Center, etc.). The active
elements at a given time constitute the conﬁguration of the airspace at that time. Thus, they give the conﬁguration
of the airspaces for an entire AIRAC cycle. Here we only use the information on sectors, airspaces and conﬁgurations
to rebuild the European airspace. Speciﬁcally, at each time we have the full three dimensional boundaries of each
individual sector and airspace in Europe. All this information have been gathered in a unique database, using MySQL,
in order to allow fast crossed queries.

Our investigations are mainly performed considering the ﬂights relative to the AIRAC 334, i.e. the AIRAC starting
on May 6, 2010 and ending on June 2, 2010. Data relative to other AIRACs are considered in order to check the
stability of our results. We only consider ﬂights that cross the German airspace, which is one of the European regions
with the highest levels of air traﬃc. Speciﬁcally, we select from our database all airspace portions labeled with an
ICAO code starting with ED. This would imply that small portions of the airspace of Belgium and Netherlands,
mainly at high altitudes, are also included in our analyses. The boundaries of the considered airspace are shown in
Fig. 9 below. Moreover, to focus our analysis on the en-route phase of each ﬂight, we ﬁlter the trajectories retaining

include Saturdays and Sundays in order to avoid weekly seasonality eﬀects.

In the left panel of Fig. 1 we show the box plot of the daily number of active ﬂights in the diﬀerent hours of the day.
An intraday pattern is clearly recognizable, with many ﬂights during day-time and almost ten times less ﬂights during
the night. In the right panel of Fig. 1 we show the number of active navigation points in the planned trajectories at
diﬀerent hours of the day. A navigation point is active in a given time interval if at least one ﬂight is scheduled to
pass through it in that interval. Also in this case one can see that signiﬁcantly less navigation points are used during
the night.

III. STATISTICAL PROPERTIES OF THE LENGTH OF PLANNED AND REALIZED TRAJECTORIES

When planning their ﬂights, the airlines have to take into account many diﬀerent constraints that give rise to
trajectories quite diﬀerent the one from the other, even for the same origin-destination airport pair in the same day.
As a result, any investigation of ﬂight trajectories aiming at detecting statistical regularities in the deviations occurring
in the realized ﬂight trajectories with respect to the planned ones, must take into account such heterogeneity. To this
end, we present ﬁrst some simple statistical facts aiming at having an overview of the data. This is the starting point
of our analysis. We seek to understand under which conditions the controllers are using speciﬁc navigation points
with respect for instance to the traﬃc conditions.

First, we associate each ﬂight trajectory with a timestamp deﬁned as (i) the entrance time in the German airspace
for ﬂights coming from diﬀerent airspaces or (ii) the ﬁrst time when the aircraft reaches 240 FL for ﬂights departing
inside the ED airspace. In this way, we are able to see that diﬀerent types of ﬂights are present during day and night.
To show this, Table I displays the mean and the 2.5% and 97.5% percentile of the distribution of ﬂight length (in km)
during day (6:00 am - 9:00 pm) and night (9:00 pm - 6:00 am). The values shown in Table I refer to the whole ﬂight
trajectory. We consider separately planned ﬂight trajectories and realized ﬂight trajectories. The ﬁrst observation is
that night-time ﬂights have ﬂight trajectories that are typically much longer than day-time ﬂights, both for planned
and realized trajectories.

distribution. All values are expressed in km. Data refer to the whole 334 AIRAC and the German (ED) airspace.

This claim is conﬁrmed by comparing the distribution function of the planned length trajectories during day and

night time shown in Fig. 2. Similar results are observed when investigating the realized trajectories.

FIG. 2: Cumulative distribution function of the length of planned ﬂight trajectories in the 334 AIRAC during day (green line)
and night (blue line). Data refer to the whole 334 AIRAC and the German (ED) airspace.

We then compare the diﬀerence in length between planned and realized trajectory, considering separately day and
night. Table I shows no appreciable diﬀerence, but this is mainly due to the large heterogeneity of ﬂight length. To
have a comparison for each ﬂight, in Figure 3 we show the probability density function of the fractional diﬀerence
between the length of planned (labeled as L(M1)) and realized (labelled as L(M3)) ﬂight trajectories during day (left)
and night (right) time. For comparison we also show a normal distribution with the same mean and variance as
the data. During day-time the distribution is almost symmetric, even if the left tail is slightly fatter than the right
one, indicating a larger probability of longer realized trajectories (L(M1) < L(M3)). On the contrary, for night-time
ﬂights, realized trajectories are more likely to be shorter than the planned trajectories (L(M1)> L(M3)), as indicated
by the fatter right tail. In any case, empirical data show tails much fatter than Gaussian ones.

FIG. 3: Semilogarithmic plot of the probability density function of the relative diﬀerence between the length of the planned
and realized trajectory of ﬂights in the German airspace during the 334 AIRAC for diﬀerent parts of the day: day-time from
6:00 am to 9:00 pm (left panel), and night-time from 9:00 pm to 6:00 am (right panel). The red lines are Gaussian density with
mean and variance matching those of the data.

These results indicate that the diﬀerence in planned and realized ﬂight length has diﬀerent characteristics during
day and night. We now investigate whether this diﬀerence is associated with a better management of the traﬃc during
night-time due, for example, to the presence of minor constraints in low traﬃc conditions.

In order to do this, we use the “ﬂight eﬃciency” Key Performance Indicator, as deﬁned by the Performance Review
Commission in [30]. This eﬃciency is related to the best path that a ﬂight can follow in theory, without taking
into account winds. Indeed, the eﬃciency is obtained by comparing the planned or realized length of the i-th ﬂight
trajectory with the length of the shortest path between its origin airport (Oi) and destination airport (Di). Speciﬁcally,
the Eﬃciency for a single ﬂight i is:

TABLE II: Average µE and standard deviation σE of the planned and realized ﬂight trajectories together with their 95%

See the text for more details about the bootstrap procedure. The values reported within round brackets refer to the 2.5 and
97.5 percentile of the average and standard deviation distributions, respectively. Data refer to the whole 334 AIRAC and the
German (ED) airspace.

where (cid:96)i is the shortest distance between origin and destination (i.e. the grand circle) associated with the ﬂight i, while
(cid:96)nvp
is the length measured along its planned or realized trajectory speciﬁed by the series of successive navigation
i
points crossed and deﬁning the ﬂight trajectory. This variable takes positive values smaller than or equal to unity. In
Table II we show the average µE (third and sixth columns), conﬁdence intervals (fourth and seventh columns) and
standard deviations σE (ﬁfth and eighth columns) of the eﬃciency computed in diﬀerent time windows of the day,
and considering planned and realized ﬂight trajectories separately. Averages are taken across all investigated ﬂights.
The conﬁdence intervals are evaluated with a bootstrap procedure 3. An important result is that for all time windows
the average eﬃciency of the planned trajectories is always smaller than the eﬃciency of realized trajectories. This
suggests that the air traﬃc controllers play an important role in increasing the system’s performances. Night-time
ﬂights (in particular during the time interval from 8:00 pm to 4:00 am) are on average more eﬃcient than day-time
ﬂights. Moreover, the gain of average eﬃciency obtained in the realized trajectories is systematically larger during
night-time. It is worth mentioning that the deﬁnition of Eq. 1 is a standard deﬁnition also used in Ref. [30]. However,
while we reported in the table the averages and standard deviations of the eﬃciency ratios, in the ATM domain it is
more customary to deal with the ratio between the average values (cid:104)(cid:96)i(cid:105) and (cid:104)(cid:96)nvp

(cid:105).

The diﬀerence of the average ﬂight trajectory eﬃciency between night and day and between planned and realized
trajectories shows the relevance of the navigation points structure in determining the choices of both the airlines and
the air traﬃc controllers in the planning and management of ﬂight trajectories. Hereafter we investigate the statistical
regularities associated with the modiﬁcations of planned ﬂight trajectories originated by the interactions between air
traﬃc controllers and pilots. In fact, we believe that a sound statistical characterization of the deviations occurring
in the realized ﬂight trajectories might be better performed focusing on the modiﬁcations occurring at the level of
navigation points.

IV. STATISTICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF FLIGHT TRAJECTORY DEVIATIONS

We ﬁrst study whether the deviations from the planned ﬂight trajectory occur in speciﬁc regions of the trajectories
or if rather they are uniformly distributed over the trajectory. To this end, for each ﬂight f i scheduled between the

3 For each two-hour time window, we store the eﬃciency values computed for each ﬂight in an Et array. We therefore obtain 12 Et
arrays. To compute the conﬁdence interval of the average eﬃciency for each Et we create 1000 bootstrap copies E∗
t by a sampling with
replacement of the element of Et. For each bootstrap replica of data we compute the average thus obtaining a distribution of average
values (cid:104)E∗
t (cid:105). The conﬁdence intervals correspond to 95% respectively associated with the 2.5 and 97.5 percentile of the average and
standard deviation distributions.

origin airport Oi and the destination airport Di and for each navigation point P i
j of the planned ﬂight trajectory,
we compute the distance di
j of the navigation point j from the destination airport Di. Such distance is computed
along the planned ﬂight trajectory. We then normalize such distance dividing it by the total planned length (cid:96)i of the
ﬂight, i.e. the distance from Oi to Di measured along the ﬂight trajectory. The normalized distance ˆdi
j is obtained
as ˆdi

probability density function of ˆdi
j for all the navigation points and for those where we detect deviations from the
planned ﬂight trajectory4. One can see by direct inspection that the two distributions are quite diﬀerent from each
other thus suggesting the idea that the navigation points where deviations occur are not randomly distributed along
the trajectory. In particular, the ﬁgure shows that there are more deviations far from the destination airport. The
ﬁgure thus shows that deviations frequently occurs close to the beginning of the ﬂight trajectory, thus indicating
that they might not occur to recover from accumulated en-route delay. Note that if the deviations from the planned
trajectories were only the consequences of traﬃc regulations, the distributions would most likely be very close to each
other, except for some special conﬁguration of the airspace.

FIG. 4: Probability density function of the normalized distance from the arrival airport of the navigation point where a
deviation occurs (blue line). As a comparison, the green line is the probability density function of the normalized distance from
the arrival airport of all navigation points crossed by the ﬂight. Normalization is obtained by dividing the distance along the
trajectory by the ﬂight length, thus 0 corresponds to the arrival airport and 1 to the departing airport. Data refer to the whole
334 AIRAC and the German (ED) airspace.

We perform a similar analysis on an angle-to-destination estimator. Speciﬁcally, for each ﬂight f i planned between
the origin airport Oi and the destination airport Di the angle-to-destination of a navigation point P i
j is the angle
αi
j between the segment connecting the two consecutive navigation points P i
j+1 and the segment connecting
j with Di, see the left panel of Fig. 5. In the right panel of Fig. 5 we show the probability density function of
P i
αi
j for (i) all the navigation points and (ii) conditioned on navigation points where we detect deviations from the
planned trajectory. Also in this case the two distributions are quite diﬀerent from each other, thus supporting the
conclusion that the navigation points where deviations occur are not randomly distributed along the ﬂight trajectory.
It is also worth mentioning that, diﬀerently from the case of ﬂight length, there exists a typical angle of 20◦ ÷ 25◦ for
which deviations occur preferentially. One can view this angle as the typical angle after which a deviation is needed,
since the aircraft is following a direction not in line with the destination airport. Note also that small angles are not
represented, probably because ﬂights in line with the destination airport do not need to be deviated. Hence, this fact
advocates a major role of the directs in the cause of deviations, rather than traﬃc regulations.

for such ﬂight trajectory we count two deviations.

FIG. 5: The left panel illustrates our deﬁnition of angle-to-destination. The right panel shows the probability density function
of the angle-to-destination variable estimated at a navigation point where a deviation occurs (blue line) and for all navigation
points (green line). Data refer to the whole 334 AIRAC and the German (ED) airspace.

A third aspect we want to emphasize is that trajectory deviations do not occur in a uniform way throughout the
day. Rather, we observe an intraday pattern, as shown in the left panel of Fig. 6. The ﬁgure shows the ratio between
the observed deviations and the possible deviations in the airspace5. Consistently with the deﬁnition of deviations
given above, the possible deviations are deﬁned as the number of navigation points that in each M1 trajectories (i)
are actually crossed by the aircraft and are therefore also present in the M3 trajectories and (ii) irrespective of the
fact that the next planned navigation point is crossed or not. As a result the number of possible deviations coincide
with the number of navigation points that are present both in the M1 and M3 ﬂight plans. This is therefore a global
metric that is not attached to a single navigation point, rather it is relative to the considered airspace. We show such
ratio as a function of the time of the day in the left panel and as a function of the number of active ﬂights in the right
panel. Interestingly, the ratio of deviations is higher during night-time than during day-time.

FIG. 6: In the left panel it is shown the ratio between the number of deviations from the planned trajectory and number of
possible deviations as a function of the hour of the day. The vertical error bars represent the Wilson score interval. See the text
for more details. The right panel shows such fraction of deviations from the planned trajectory as a function of the number
of active ﬂights in diﬀerent hours of the say. The number indicate the hour of the day. Diﬀerent symbols refer to diﬀerent
AIRACs, from AIRAC 334 to AIRAC 338. Data refer to the German (ED) airspace.

5 Error bars are given by the Wilson score interval [31] used to associate a conﬁdence interval to a proportion in a statistical population.
The Wilson interval is an improvement over the normal approximation interval. In fact, it is more accurate even for a small number of
trials and for extreme probabilities. It can be derived from Pearson’s chi-squared test with two categories and it is deﬁned as:

This observation, as well as the observation on the angles, suggests that, since traﬃc is lower during night, the main
motivation for deviations is not the need of dealing with safety issues, but rather the possibility of issuing directs that
will shorten the ﬂight trajectories. This is conﬁrmed by the results summarized in the right panel of Fig. 6 where we
plot the fraction of deviations as a function of the total number of aircraft present in the considered time window,
averaged over an entire AIRAC. Each point refers to an hourly time-window and diﬀerent symbols refer to diﬀerent
AIRACs, from 334 to 338.

An inverse relation between the fraction of deviated ﬂights and the number of active ﬂights is observed. During
night-time (blue points) the traﬃc is lower and the fraction of deviations is larger, while the opposite is true during
day-time. The ﬁgure therefore indicates that there exists an anti-correlation between fraction of deviations and traﬃc.
When using the Pearson correlation coeﬃcient we estimate a statistically signiﬁcant correlation of -0.88, only slightly
diﬀerent from the value -0.83 obtained when we consider the Spearman correlation coeﬃcient. This fact conﬁrms that
most of the deviations are actually directs, because safety issues are very few during the night.

Finally, Fig. 7 shows the point-biserial correlation between the angle-to-destination for a navigation point, that
is a quantitative variable, and the presence or absence of a ﬂight deviation at the same navigation point, that is a
categorical one 6. The ﬁgure shows that the correlation is statistically diﬀerent from zero. The aim of this analysis is
to assess the controllers behavior in optimizing the trajectories. In fact, the stronger the correlation, the higher the
tendency of the controller in deviating aircraft. The observed intraday dynamics indicates an higher point-biserial
correlation during night (from 8:00 pm to 4:00 am) rather than during the day. Again this result can be explained in
terms of air traﬃc controllers-pilots interaction to optimize ﬂight paths rather than interventions due to solve safety
issues.

FIG. 7: Point-biserial correlation between the angle-to-destination and the categorical variable indicating the presence of a
deviation of the planned ﬂight trajectory as a function of the hour of the day. Data refer to the whole 334 AIRAC and the
German (ED) airspace.

The conclusion of the previous statistical facts is the importance of pro-active deviations rather than reactive ones.
In other words, controllers usually modify the horizontal trajectories in order to speed the ﬂights up. This leads to
deviations starting early in the trajectory, triggered by high angles-to-destination and low traﬃc condition, usually
during night. We are now interested in studying the temporal heterogeneities of the deviations, focusing on single
navigation point pairs, i.e. trajectory segments.

V. OVER-EXPRESSION AND UNDER-EXPRESSION OF FLIGHT DEVIATIONS AT NAVIGATION

POINTS ORDERED PAIRS

In this section we ﬁrst discuss a metric, called fork, that is used for characterizing the diﬀerences between planned
and realized ﬂight trajectories at the level of each single navigation point. The fork metric was introduced in Ref.
[32]. Let us ﬁrst provide a qualitative description of it. For each ﬂight, we consider the last navigation point which
is common to the planned and the realized ﬂight trajectory. At this point, we consider that a “fork” happens when

6 The point-biserial is nothing but the Pearson correlation coeﬃcient between a vector with real entries and a boolean vector made of [0,

1]. As in Fig. II the error bars are computed by using a bootstrap replica of data and considering a 95-percentile conﬁdence interval.

04812162024Time (hours)0.100.120.140.160.180.200.220.24rpb9

the ﬂight trajectory is deviated from the planned one. By counting the number of ﬂights which are deviated from the
considered navigation point and by dividing it by the total number of ﬂights ﬂying through the navigation point in the
selected time interval, we obtain a quantitative indicator of how much the navigation point is a “source” of deviations
for the planned ﬂight trajectories. This quantity varies between 0 and 1 and is computed for each navigation point.
Hereafter we are providing a more formal deﬁnition. Let us consider a certain time window ∆t. Let us consider a
generic navigation point P appearing in at least one of the realized ﬂight trajectories. Let us call pF∆t(P ) the number
of ﬂights passing through P as observed in the planned ﬂight trajectories. Let us call dF∆t(P ) the number of ﬂights
passing through P , as observed in the realized ﬂight trajectories, and missing the next navigation point as indicated in
the corresponding planned ﬂight trajectory. The fork F∆t(P ) is deﬁned as the ratio F∆t(P ) = dF∆t(P )/pF∆t(P ). By
construction, this metric aggregates the information on the diﬀerent ﬂight trajectories that in a certain time window
∆t are passing through P .

This metric already produced some interesting results presented in [32]. However, its weakness relies in the hetero-
geneity of trajectories which can cross a single navigation point. Indeed, controllers are managing ﬂows, i.e. ensemble
of trajectories, and for them the navigation point is a support to the ﬂow. As a consequence, diﬀerent ﬂows crossing
at a given navigation point can be managed diﬀerently. We therefore introduce a slightly diﬀerent metric, where we
take into account the direction of the ﬂow as well as the navigation point itself.

A. The directional fork

Let us consider pairs C(Pj, Pk) = (Pj, Pk) of navigation points that are consecutively crossed according to a certain
ﬂight plan. The navigation point pairs we consider are ordered and therefore (Pj, Pk) and (Pk, Pj) are diﬀerent pairs
describing ﬂights passing through the same pair of navigation points but moving in the opposite direction.

Similarly to the previously mentioned fork metric, the directional fork (or di-fork) Φ∆t(C) associated with an
ordered navigation point pair C is deﬁned as the ratio Φ∆t(C) = DF∆t(C)/P F∆t(C) where P F∆t(C) is the number
of ﬂights planned to ﬂow through Pj and Pk in the direction from j to k and DF∆t(C) is the number of ﬂights
actually crossing Pj and then deviated to a navigation point diﬀerent from Pk in the considered time window ∆t. In
other words, the ﬁrst navigation point is the one crossed by the aircraft and the second one is the navigation point
present in the planned ﬂight trajectory but not present in the realized ﬂight trajectory. This deﬁnition allows us to
investigate the deviations as a function of the diﬀerent directions, and to have a more ﬂow-based metric. It is worth
emphasizing again that the di-fork metric refers to navigation point pairs, while the fork metric of Ref. [32] refers to
single navigation points.

Below we investigate the capabilities of the di-fork metric in providing a statistical characterization of the deviations
occurring in the ﬂight trajectories. More speciﬁcally, we are interested in seeing how the statistical facts we found in
section IV are present at the microscopic level, i.e. at the navigation point pair level.

B. Navigation point pairs with over-expressed and under-expressed values of the di-fork metric

Here we investigate whether the ﬂight trajectory deviations are randomly distributed over the day or rather if they
are over-expressed or under-expressed for speciﬁc navigation point pairs. This type of investigation cannot be done
only in terms of the occurrence of the ﬂight trajectory deviations because the number of ﬂights passing through a
speciﬁc navigation point pair in a given time interval is a quite heterogeneous variable. We therefore estimate the
over-expression and under-expression of ﬂight trajectory deviations by considering navigation point pairs and trying
to compare the occurrences of ﬂight trajectory deviations observed in this pair with an appropriate null model.

In this section we investigate the navigation point pairs C(Pj, Pk) for which the air traﬃc ﬂow is from Pj to Pk.
Suppose that during a speciﬁc day we have P Fday ﬂights with planned ﬂight trajectories connecting Pj to Pk in a
step. Suppose also that DFday is the number of ﬂights passing through the ﬁrst navigation point Pj and deviating
from the successive navigation point Pk in the same day. Let us now deﬁne P F∆t the ﬂights that are planned to
ﬂy through Pj and Pk during an intraday time interval ∆t. We can estimate what is the probability of observing a
number DF∆t of ﬂights ﬂying through Pj and then deviating from Pk during the same time interval. By assuming
that for each navigation point pair, the ﬂight trajectory deviation events are independent the one from the other, a

By using this value of the probability of observing DF∆t deviated ﬂight trajectories we can obtain for each navigation
point pair C(Pj, Pk) a p-value for the over-expression or the under-expression of DF∆t. The probability of Eq.
(3) allows us to associate a p-value p(DF∆t) with the actual number DF∆t of detected deviation. Speciﬁcally, for
over-expression (OE) we have

X=0

Since we are performing this test for all possible navigation point pairs C(Pj, Pk), we have to use a correction for
multiple hypothesis test comparison. Speciﬁcally we use the FDR multiple hypothesis test correction [35] there-
fore, after sorting the p-values in increasing order, in order to reveal over-expression or under-expression we select
those navigation point pairs with p-values which are below the straight line with null intercept and slope equal to
0.01/2NpairNt where Nt = 12 is the number of used time bins and Npair is the number of possible pairs we tested.
As an example, when testing the 334 AIRAC only we would use Npair = 29076. In the analysis presented below,
where we test for over- and under-expressions over ﬁve consecutive AIRACs we will consider Npair = 146112. The
factor 2 is taken into account because we want to consider both over- and under-expressions. In the results presented
hereafter, we aggregate the number of temporally over-expressed and under-expressed navigation point pairs relative
to the diﬀerent days of an AIRAC.

In Fig. 8 we illustrate an example of the two possible outcomes of the statistical validation procedure associated to
the hypergeometric distribution described above. The left panel indicates a situation where we have an over-expressed
navigation point pair (tick red segment). The ﬁrst navigation point is crossed by 90 aircraft. However only 48 of
them reach the other navigation point of the pair. This results in a di-fork value of (90 − 48)/90 = 0.467 which
leads to an over-expression as a result of the comparison with the average daily behavior characterized by a di-fork
value of (987 − 785)/987 = 0.205, see the central panel. The right panel shows the same pair in a diﬀerent time
window. Now there are many more aircraft crossing the two navigation points. However, the pair results to be
under-expressed, given that only 135− 131 = 4 out of 135 aircraft do not cross the second navigation point of the pair.
The example shows that having an over-expressed or under-expressed pair does not necessarily indicate that the pair
is more frequently used. Rather, the statistical validation procedure associated to the hypergeometric distribution
selects the pairs where the occurrence of deviations is statistically diﬀerent from the daily average.

7 It is worth mentioning that using the hypergeometric distribution is equivalent to performing an one tail Fishers exact test [33] starting
from a 2× 2 contingency table whose entries are DF∆t and P F∆t− DF∆t in the ﬁrst column and DFday − DF∆t and (P Fday − DFday)−
(P F∆t − DF∆t) in the second column [34].

11

FIG. 8: The left panel shows a navigation point pair (tick red segment) where the ﬁrst navigation point is crossed by 90 aircraft.
However only 48 of them reach the other navigation point of the pair. This results in a di-fork value of (90 − 48)/90 = 0.467.
The right panel shows a navigation point pair (tick red segment) where the ﬁrst navigation point is crossed by 135 aircraft.
and 131 of them reach the other navigation point of the pair. This results in a di-fork value of (135 − 131)/135 = 0.030. The
central panel shows the daily behavior of the considered pair. The ﬁrst navigation point is overall crossed by 987 aircraft, with
785 of them reaching the other navigation point of the pair. Therefore the average daily behavior is characterized by a di-fork
value of (987 − 785)/987 = 0.205.

In Table III we show the number of over-expressed (second column) and under-expressed (third column) navigation
point pairs in the 334 AIRAC. The fourth and ﬁfth column show the number of navigation point pairs with at least
one and ﬁve planned ﬂights, respectively. The number of over-expressed navigation point pairs is larger in the night
than during day-time, while the opposite is true for under-expressed pairs. Time windows of early morning (e.g. the
6:00 am 8:00 am time window) and of early afternoon (e.g. the 2:00 pm 4:00 pm time window) present a roughly
balanced number of over-expressed and under-expressed navigation point pairs. The ﬁfth and sixth columns indicate
the number of OE and UE observed in at least one of the 5 AIRACs from 334 to 338.

TABLE III: Number of over-expressed (second column) and under-expressed (third column) navigation point pairs observed in
the 334 AIRAC during diﬀerent time windows of the day. The fourth and ﬁfth column show the number of navigation point
pairs with at least one or ﬁve planned ﬂights, respectively. The ﬁfth and sixth columns indicate the number of OE and UE
observed in at least one of the 5 AIRACs from 334 to 338. Data shown in this table were obtained by using the FDR correction
for multiple test comparison with Npair = 146112. Data refer to the German (ED) airspace.

For illustrative purposes, in Fig. 9 we show the localization of the under-expressed pairs and over-expressed pairs
in the 12 bi-hourly time-windows occurring in a day. The diﬀerent colors are proportional to the measured di-fork
value in the considered time-window, according to the color code on the right of the ﬁgure. Although there seem to
be a predominance of segments with colors belonging to upper and lower part of the color bar, in some case we can
also see, see panel (2, 4) for instance, some segment with colors belonging to the central part of the color bar. Once
again, this indicates that the statistical validation procedure associated to the hypergeometric distribution selects the
pairs where the occurrence of deviations is statistically diﬀerent from the daily average, rather than pairs with higher

FIG. 9: Spatial localization of the under-expressed pairs and over-expressed pairs over the day. The diﬀerent colors are
proportional to the measured di-fork value in the considered time-window.

In fact, in the left panel of Fig. 10 we show all navigation point pairs of the considered airspace in the 12 bi-hourly
time-windows occurring in a day. As in the above case, the diﬀerent colors are proportional to the measured di-fork
value in the considered time-window, according to the color code on the right of the panel8. The comparison of
such panel with Fig. 9 clearly shows that navigation point pairs with larger di-fork values are not over-expressed as
well as navigation point pairs with small di-fork values are not under-expressed. In the right panel of Fig. 10 we
show again all navigation point pairs of the considered airspace in the 12 bi-hourly time-windows occurring in a day.
However, here the colors are proportional to the number of aircraft traveling across the navigation point pair in the
considered time window9. By comparing such panel with Fig. 9 one can clearly see that highly travelled segments
are not necessarily over-expressed while poorly travelled segments are not necessarily under-expressed.

8 In this graphical representation the navigation point pairs C = (a, b) and C = (b, a) are considered together.

In other words, the
di-fork value represented here is deﬁned as (DF (C) + DF (C))/(P F (C) + P F (C)). Moreover, we only show the segments such that
(P F (C) + P F (C)) ≥ 5

9 In this graphical representation the navigation point pairs C = (a, b) and C = (b, a) are considered together. Accordingly, the number

of aircraft shown in the ﬁgure is the sum of the number go ﬂights traveling from one navigation point to the other in both directions.

FIG. 10: Spatial localization of the navigation point pairs over the day. In the left panel the diﬀerent colors are proportional
to the measured di-fork value in the considered time-window. In the right panel the diﬀerent colors are proportional to the
number of aircraft traveling across the navigation point pair in the considered time window.

The spatial localization of the over-(under-)expressed navigation point pairs might change for diﬀerent time-
intervals. Again this is not surprising because the di-fork metric not only takes into account the topology of the
navigation point network which has a slow dynamics over the day, but it also takes into account the ﬂow of aircraft
over the network, which is instead pretty variable over the day. However, stable patterns can be detected. In fact, we
investigated the temporal persistence of the over-expression and under-expression of ﬂight deviations at navigation
point pairs in Fig. 11. This is a color coded ﬁgure showing for each investigated time window of the day and for each
statistically validated navigation point pairs of the AIRAC 334 whether each navigation point pair turns out to be also
over-expressed or under-expressed in the 4 AIRACs successive to AIRAC 334. In the ﬁgure a value of 5 (labeled as a
red cell) indicates that the navigation point pair is over-expressed in all ﬁve considered AIRACs. Negative numbers
indicate under-expression. It is worth mentioning that a pair over-expressed (under-expressed) in a certain AIRAC
never happens to be under-expressed (over-expressed) in the other 4 AIRACs. For comparison, in the ﬁfth and sixth
column of Table III we indicate the number of OE and UE observed in at least one of the 5 AIRACs from 334 to
338. One can see that there are only a few navigation point pairs that are over-expressed during the 5 AIRACs both
during day time and during night-time. The two periods of the day show a quite diﬀerent general pattern suggesting
again diﬀerent underlying reasons for the deviations of the planned ﬂight trajectories.

FIG. 11: Color code summary of the persistence of over-expressed and under-expressed navigation point pairs statistically
validated during AIRAC 334 and during the successive 4 AIRACs. On the x axis we report the time window of the day and
each horizontal line parallel to the x axis represents a navigation point pair statistically validated at least once during AIRAC
334. Positive values (red cells) indicate that the navigation point pair is repeatedly over-expressed during diﬀerent AIRACs at
the considered time window. Negative values (blue cells) indicate repeated under-expression. Data refer to the ﬁve AIRACs
from 334 to 338 and to navigation point pairs of the German (ED) airspace. Data shown in this table were obtained by using
the FDR correction for multiple test comparison with Npair = 146112.

In fact, the ﬁgure is consistent with our previous ﬁndings and gives us more information. It seems that during the
night, controllers are consistently deviating some of the ﬂows in the airspaces, probably to shorten the corresponding
trajectories. During the day on the other hand, controllers are stabilizing the horizontal deviations, especially some
ﬂows, which are probably more complex than the others. This also complements the results of [32], in which we were
only able to see that some navigation points were consistently over-used for deviations.

As a result, the di-fork metric seems able to show in quantitative way that the fraction of deviations occurring at
the level of single navigation point pairs during the day is not a random variable. Rather it follows patterns that
reveal to be stable over diﬀerent AIRACs. Therefore it provides an useful instrument for a “microscopic” statistical
characterization of the deviations from planned ﬂight trajectories in the air traﬃc management procedures.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

The air transportation system is a complex system with a pronounced intraday dynamics and a marked spatial
heterogeneity. For example, by using traﬃc data, we have veriﬁed that day ﬂights and night ﬂights present a diﬀerent
value for their average length and a diﬀerent distribution of ﬂight length. In the air traﬃc management procedures,
the interaction between pilots and air traﬃc controllers is primarily devoted to conﬂict resolutions aiming to pre-
vent safety problems. Once safety problems are positively avoided or solved the interaction between pilots and air
controllers focuses on possible improvement of the eﬃciency of the air transportation system. To analyze the eﬀect
on the eﬃciency improvement of the system of their interaction we have considered a very simple measure of ﬂight
eﬃciency based on the comparison between the length of planned or realized ﬂight trajectory with the grand circle
distance. Our results show that night-time ﬂights (in particular during the time interval from 8:00 pm to 4:00 am)
are on average more eﬃcient than day-time ﬂights. Moreover, the gain of average eﬃciency obtained in the realized
trajectories is systematically larger during night-time. Our results show an asymmetry in the change of eﬃciency
of ﬂights during night-time. Speciﬁcally for large changes in absolute value the improvement is more evident than
the deterioration. This asymmetry is not detected during day-time when eﬃciency improvement is quite balanced by
eﬃciency deterioration.

The strategic interaction present between pilots and air controllers is also reﬂected in the observation that ﬂight
trajectory deviations preferentially occur near the origin rather than close to destination of the ﬂight. Moreover, ﬂight
trajectory deviations occur at an angle-to-destination that is a non monotonic function of the angle with a maximum
observed close to 20 degree. Pilots and air controllers are most probably solving on average diﬀerent kind of problems
during day and night. In fact we observe that the fraction of ﬂight trajectory deviations is higher during night-time
than during day-time intraday time windows. We also detect that the fraction of ﬂight trajectory deviations is an
inverse function of the number of ﬂights observed in the investigated time window.

Our study shows that the time of the day plays an important role in setting the most probable type of interaction
between pilots and air controllers. Indeed, in addition to time there is also a role of the speciﬁc geographical location
of the considered navigation point pair. To clarify this point we introduce a new metric called di-fork that is useful
to track the trajectory deviations at the level of single navigation point pairs. By making use of this metric, we can
detect the set of navigation point pairs presenting a number of ﬂight trajectory deviations that are over-expressed
or under-expressed with respect to a statistical null hypothesis assuming (i) that deviations occur randomly over the
day and (ii) taking into account the heterogeneous number of ﬂights planned to ﬂy through the navigation point
pair over the day. The detected set of over-expressed and under-expressed navigation point pairs is persistent over
a time period spanning 5 successive AIRACs, i.e. for up to at least 140 days. This result quantitatively shows that
the fraction of deviations occurring during the day is not a random variable. Rather, it corresponds to the eﬀort of
making the system more eﬃcient under certain constraints due, for example, to safety and capacity issues.

We believe our results present a clear statistical evidence of the ability of the air traﬃc management system of on
average improving air traﬃc performances with respect to the set of planned ﬂight trajectories. The improvement of
performances are relatively more evident during night-time time windows when constraints related to the capacity of
air sectors are less stringent.

In summary our results show that the interaction between pilots and air controllers is a complex one that that is
the result of a learning process aiming not only at the prevention and resolution of safety problems but also to the
improvement of the performances of each single airline and of the entire air transportation system.
