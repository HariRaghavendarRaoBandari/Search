Predicted twenty years ago, positron binding to neutral atoms has not yet been observed experimentally. A
new scheme is proposed to detect positron-atom bound states by colliding Rydberg positronium (Ps) with neutral
atoms. Estimates of the charge-transfer-reaction cross section are obtained using the ﬁrst Born approximation
for a selection of neutral atom targets and a wide range of incident Ps energies and principal quantum numbers.
We also estimate the corresponding Ps ionization cross section. The accuracy of the calculations is tested by
comparison with earlier predictions for Ps charge transfer in collisions with hydrogen and antihydrogen. We
describe an existing Rydberg Ps beam suitable for producing positron-atom bound states and estimate signal
rates based on the calculated cross sections and realistic experimental parameters. We conclude that the proposed
methodology is capable of producing such states and of testing theoretical predictions of their binding energies.

INTRODUCTION

Being antimatter particles, positrons (e+) are of fundamen-
tal importance for tests of QED and the Standard Model [1–3],
and in astrophysics [4]. They also ﬁnd numerous applications
in condensed matter physics, surface science, atomic physics,
and medicine (see, e.g., Refs. [5–7]). Though positrons were
discovered more than eighty years ago [8], there is still much
about their interactions with matter that is not fully under-
stood.

One such outstanding question is positron binding to neu-
tral atoms. Positron-atom bound states were ﬁrst predicted
by many-body-theory calculations in 1995 [9]. Two years
later, variational calculations carried out by Ryzhikh and
Mitroy [10] and Strasburger and Chojnacki [11] conﬁrmed
that a positron can bind to lithium. Soon after, many cal-
culations of positron binding to other atoms appeared; see
Ref. [12] for a 2002 review. Despite a wealth of predictions
for positron-atom binding energies now available (for a sur-
vey of the Periodic Table, see Refs. [13, 14]), no experimental
evidence of positron-atom bound states has yet arisen. This
is chieﬂy due to the limited availability of suitable positron
sources, the difﬁculty in obtaining the required neutral atom
species in the gas phase, and the need to implement an efﬁ-
cient production and unambiguous detection schemes.

The situation for positron binding with molecules is essen-
tially the opposite [15]. Positron annihilation in polyatomic
molecules is typically mediated by positron capture in vibra-
tional Feshbach resonances (VFR), where the positron en-
ters a quasibound state by transferring its excess energy into
molecular vibrations of a single mode with near-resonant en-
ergy. By using a trap-based positron beam [16, 17], exper-
imentalists were able to observe VFRs in the positron en-
ergy dependence of the annihilation rate [18]. The downshift

‡ a.deller@ucl.ac.uk
§ g.gribakin@qub.ac.uk

of a resonance relative to the vibrational excitation energy
provided a measure of the positron binding energy. This has
enabled positron binding energies to be determined for over
seventy molecules [19–22]. On the side of theory, there are
few calculations of positron binding to nonpolar or weakly
polar molecules. The zero-range potential model [23, 24]
captured the qualitative features for the alkanes, and there
were conﬁguration-interaction (CI) calculations for carbon-
containing triatomic molecules [25, 26]. For strongly polar
molecules many quantum-chemistry calculations have been
performed, but only a few of them allow direct comparison
with experiment; recent CI calculations for nitriles, aldehydes,
and acetone [27–29] gave binding energies within 25–50% of
experimental values. A simple theoretical model was recently
proposed to explain the dependence of the binding energy on
the molecular dipole moment and dipole polarizability [30].

Regarding positron-atom bound states, several ways of de-
tecting them in experiment have been proposed. In Ref. [31]
it was suggested that positronic atoms could be formed in col-
lisions with negative ions, e+ + A− → e+A + e−, the positron
afﬁnity determining the energy threshold of this reaction. As
is the case of molecules, for some atoms it may be possible to
observe resonances in the positron annihilation rate and asso-
ciate these with binding [32]. Another scheme for measuring
positron-atom binding energies is laser-assisted photorecom-
bination of positrons from a trap-based beam with metal atoms
in a vapor [33]. It may also be possible to capture positrons
into shallow bound levels using pulses of a very strong mag-
netic ﬁeld [14].

Here we propose an alternative strategy for the creation and
detection of positron-atom bound states in charge-exchange
collisions of Rydberg-state positronium (Ps) with neutral
atoms. Rydberg Ps was ﬁrst generated by Ziock et al. us-
ing a linac-based positron beam [34], but it was only possi-
ble to demonstrate the production of a few high-lying states
with principal quantum numbers n = 13–15. Modern positron-
trapping [35] and detection [36] techniques have facilitated
much more efﬁcient production of Rydberg Ps [37]. In par-
ticular, it has been possible to selectively populate individ-
ual Rydberg-Stark states [38] through a two-step excitation

scheme Ps(1s) → Ps(2p) → Ps(ns,nd) [34, 37, 39]. These
developments make further experimentation feasible, with a
view to creating a focused Ps beam suitable for gravity mea-
surements [40, 41]. Rydberg Ps is also important for the pro-
duction of low-energy antihydrogen atoms (H) through colli-
sions with antiprotons (p) [42, 43], viz.,
Ps + p −→ H + e−,

(1)

where the H production increases rapidly with the excitation
of Ps. This reaction is to be used to create antihydrogen in the
proposed GBAR [44] and AEgIS [45] experiments, designed
to test whether the weak equivalence principle applies to anti-
matter in the same way it does to matter. A number of calcula-
tions of reaction (1) have been performed, mostly for ground-
state Ps and ground-state H [46], though there are some calcu-
lations for the collisions involving excited states [43, 47–49].
Recent technological developments [35] in positron trap-
ping and detection have made the method we propose here
more feasible. The basic procedure is as follows: a time-
focused positron pulse is implanted into a suitable mate-
rial, resulting in the production of ground-state orthopositro-
nium (o-Ps) atoms. These are subsequently excited via n = 2
to levels with n = 3–30 using nanosecond-pulsed UV (λ =
243.0 nm) and IR (λ = 729–1312 nm) laser radiation. Ps
atoms in varying Rydberg states and having kinetic energies
in the range of 10–1000 meV collide with neutral atoms A in
a scattering cell, enabling the reaction

Ps(nl) + A −→ e+A + e−

(2)

to take place, where e+A is the positron bound state with the
atom, e.g., Mg, Cu, or Zn [50]. The cross section for this pro-
cess depends on the incident Ps energy, the initial state nl of
Ps, and on the positron-atom binding energy εb. Reaction (2)
leads to rapid positron annihilation; the positron-atom bound
state lifetime is [51, 52]

τa ∼ 0.7ε−1/2

b

ns,

(3)

where εb is in electronvolts. These are typically a few nanosec-
onds, which is much shorter than Rydberg Ps ﬂuorescence
lifetimes. Thus, the formation of bound states in the proposed
experiment can be detected by an increase in annihilation
events in the scattering cell, and a corresponding decrease in
events seen downstream. Varying the Rydberg Ps states and
kinetic energies will provide additional controls and make it
possible to test theoretical predictions.

Detection of positron-atom bound states in reaction (2)
will be the ﬁrst observation of its kind. A comparison of
the measured cross section with the theoretical results de-
rived in this paper should provide an estimate of the positron
binding energy, which could be compared with existing high-
quality predictions [12–14]. It would also be interesting to ap-
ply this method to molecules for which the binding energies
are known from the resonant annihilation studies [15, 19–22].
Unlike positron-molecule annihilation which probes resonant,
quasibound states, the molecular analog of reaction (2) should
lead to population of the true positron-molecule bound states.

2

Molecules also allow one to explore reaction (2) for systems
with very small binding energies, e.g., C2H6 or CH3F. Their
positron afﬁnities are expected to be ∼1 meV [53, 54] but have
not be measured directly because such shifts of the annihila-
tion resonances are much smaller than the energy resolution
of the positron beam.

There are several calculations of the cross section for reac-
tion (2) and its negative-ion analog. All of them consider the
equivalent processes involving the hydrogen or antihydrogen
atoms,

Ps(nl) + H −→ e+H + e−,
Ps(nl) + H −→ H− + e+,

(4a)
(4b)

for low n. Biswas [55] estimated the cross section for Ps(1s)-
H(1s) collisions using the coupled-channel formalism, treat-
ing the outgoing positron as a plane wave. Later, Blackwood
et al. [56] and Walters et al. [57] intimated that inclusion of
the Coulomb interaction between the ion and lepton in the ﬁ-
nal state is important for obtaining accurate results. Roy et
al. [58] then calculated the cross section for Ps(1s)-H(1s) col-
lisions within the Coulomb-modiﬁed eikonal approximation,
which accounts for this Coulomb interaction; they obtained
results signiﬁcantly at variance with those of Biswas [55]. Roy
and Sinha [59] extended the work of Roy et al. [58] to in-
clude the n = 2 states of Ps. Most recently, Comini et al. [60]
computed the cross section for Ps(nl)-H(n(cid:48)l(cid:48)) collisions us-
ing the continuum-distorted-wave–ﬁnal-state method (details
in Ref. [61]); they considered n = 1–3 and n(cid:48) = 1–5 but only
showed the contributions for n(cid:48) = 1, stating that the contribu-
tions for n(cid:48) = 2–5 were negligible in comparison. Addition-
ally, there exist calculations [62–65] for the reverse reactions

e+H + e− −→ Ps(nl) + H,
H− + e+ −→ Ps(nl) + H,

(5a)
(5b)

for n = 1 and 2, and the total for n ≥ 3 [64]. These can be
related to the forward cross sections through the principle of
detailed balance [66]. We are unaware of any detailed calcu-
lations of forward or reverse cross sections for higher n.

Here we provide an approximate theoretical method for es-
timating the cross section for reaction (2) for a generic target
atom or molecule A. Calculations have ﬁrst been carried out
for reactions (4) and benchmarked against the existing data
from the literature to investigate the accuracy of our method.
Results are then given for the Rydberg Ps collisions for vari-
ous e+A binding energies.

The paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the
theoretical basis of our calculations; numerical results are then
presented in Sec. III. Section IV outlines the experimental pro-
cedures that will be involved. We conclude in Sec. V with a
summary of the work.

II. THEORY

A. Calculation of the cross section

We seek to compute the cross sections for reaction (2), in
which a Ps atom with principal quantum number n and orbital
quantum number l collides with a stationary atom A (which
is at the origin). The center-of-mass momentum of the inci-
dent Ps is K, and the momentum of the outgoing electron is k.
Unless otherwise stated, atomic units are used.

We work in the ﬁrst Born approximation, taking the mo-
tion of the incident Ps and the outgoing electron as plane
waves. The positron-atom binding energy is typically small
(a fraction of an electronvolt). The wave function of the
weakly bound positron is diffuse and located mostly outside
the atom; hence, we describe it using the zero-range-potential
model [67] (see also Refs. [23, 51, 54]).

The amplitude for the process is given by

Am(K) =

e−ik·r1ϕ∗0 (r2)V (r2)eiK·Rψnlm(r)d3r1 d3r2, (6)

where r1 (r2) is the position of the electron (positron), ϕ0 is
the wave function of the bound positron (with energy ε0 =
−εb), V is the positron-atom interaction (which serves as the
perturbation), ψnlm is the internal Ps wave function (with m the
magnetic quantum number), R = (r1 + r2)/2 is the position
of the Ps center of mass, and r = r1 − r2 is the position of
the electron in Ps relative to the positron. The cross section
σm(K) is obtained from

we have d3k = k2 dk dΩk = k d(k2/2)dΩk, where dΩk =
sinθk dθk dφk is the solid angle element. Integrating Eq. (7)

(cid:114) 1

Note that the cross section is proportional to the probability
of ﬁnding the electron with momentum p = k − K/2 in the
initial Ps state [see Eq. (14) or (17)]. This is the momentum
that must be added to the average momentum of the electron
within the incident Ps (K/2) to create an outgoing electron
with momentum k, i.e., p is the momentum transfer.

Before looking at numerical values of the cross section (18),
there is an important point to note concerning the energy con-
servation relation (9). For εb > 1/4n2, the reaction is exother-
mic and feasible for any Ps momentum K. Conversely, for
εb < 1/4n2 the reaction is endothermic and only feasible for
K > Kth, where Kth is the threshold Ps momentum,

Kth =

n2 − 4εb.

(19)

For a ﬁxed binding energy εb there is a critical value ncrit =
(4εb)−1/2 such that the reaction is endothermic for the Ps prin-
cipal quantum numbers n < ncrit and exothermic for n > ncrit.
In the exothermic case the cross section (18) behaves as
σ ∝ 1/K near threshold (K → 0), while in the endothermic
case one has σ ∝ k ∝ √E − Eth, when the Ps center-of-mass-
motion energy, E = K2/4, is close to the threshold energy
Eth = 1/4n2 − εb. Such behaviour is in agreement with the
Wigner threshold laws for particles with short-range inter-
actions [66]. In a more accurate treatment, the Coulomb in-
teraction between the ﬁnal-state electron and e+A must be
included, which would change the latter threshold law to
σ = const. As we will see in Sec. III, in the εb < 1/4n2
case, a rapid rise of the cross section from threshold quickly
turns into decrease. One can thus expect that the effect of
the Coulomb interaction is small outside the narrow near-
threshold region in which the electron’s kinetic energy is
smaller than the Coulomb interaction in the initial Ps state,
i.e., for k2/2 < 1/r ∼ 1/2n2 (using the mean Coulomb inter-
action in Ps(nl) in the last estimate).

B. Semiclassical approximation

Alhough it is straightforward to calculate the cross sec-
tion by evaluating the integral in Eq. (18) numerically (see
Sec. III), an approximate analytical solution can be derived by
invoking a semiclassical approximation. This leads to a sim-
ple expression for the cross section and provides additional
physical insight into the nature of the problem.

4

The quantity p2|Fnl(p)|2 is the probability density of the in-
ternal momentum of the incident Ps. For large principal quan-
tum numbers n, the motion in the Coulomb ﬁeld can be de-
scribed semiclassically [66]. The Ps Rydberg states produced
by two-photon excitations [37, 38] have l = 0, 2. The simplest
answer for n (cid:29) l can be obtained by replacing p2|Fnl(p)|2 by
its classical counterpart wn(p) for zero classical angular mo-
mentum (L = 0) (see, e.g., Ref. [69]):

wn(p) =

4p3
n

π(p2 + p2

n)2 ,

(20)

2 the reduced mass of Ps and

where pn = √−2µEn, with µ = 1
En = −1/4n2 the quantized Ps energy levels.
Note that the classical angular momentum L is related to the
orbital quantum number l by L = l + 1
2. In principle, one could
calculate the cross sections for l = 0 and 2 using the generic
classical momentum distribution for L ≥ 0 (see Ref. [69]) in-
stead of Eq. (20). In this case, however, the cross section does
not have a simple analytical form. As we will see in Sec. III,
the semiclassical cross section derived from Eq. (20) is a good
approximation for low l, such as l = 0 and 2.
Substituting wn(p)/p2 in place of |Fnl(p)|2 in Eq. (18) we
have

Note that this expression diverges weakly (logarithmically)
for k = K/2. This occurs for endothermic reactions at the in-
cident Ps momentum K = √2Kth. The corresponding peak in
the semiclassical cross section coincides with the maximum
of the l = 0 quantum-mechanical cross section (see Sec. III).

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS

Cross sections have been computed in the present work by
evaluating Eq. (18) numerically. The functions Fnl(p) were
computed for 0 ≤ p ≤ 15 on a linear grid with 1,000,000
points. For each combination of n and l, the accuracy of the
procedure was tested by evaluating the normalization integral

(cid:90) ∞
0 |Fnl(p)|2 p2 d p

I =

numerically. In every case, the computed value of I was found
to be within 10−8 of the exact value I = 1. It is necessary to
use such a large number of points because the function Fnl
possesses n− l − 1 nodes, so for Rydberg states with large n
and small l, Fnl(p) oscillates very rapidly at small p.

than the data of McAlinden et al. [64], but is in close agree-
ment with the cross section of Comini et al. [60]. It is remark-
able that our approach gives reasonable results here, in spite
of its simplicity, and the fact that it is expected to work best
for the Ps Rydberg states.

Figure 2 compares the present calculations for Ps(2s,2p)
with the existing calculations. It is interesting to note that the
present 2s and 2p cross sections are equal to each other at ap-
proximately the same incident Ps energy (≈22 eV) as those of
Roy and Sinha [59]. Again, the best agreement is with the
results of Comini et al. [60], while the present data are at
least an order of magnitude greater than those of McAlinden
et al. [64].

Figure 3 compares our cross sections for Ps(3s,3p,3d) with
the only other available set of results by Comini et al. [60].
The value of ncrit for the formation of H− is 3.004, meaning
that these reactions are at the cusp between being endothermic
and exothermic. There is reasonably good agreement for all
three cross sections for incident Ps energies (cid:38)1 eV.

A. Comparsions with existing calculations for Ps-H collisions

We ﬁrst calculated the cross sections for the equivalent re-
actions (4) by considering incident Ps with n = 1–3 and col-
lision energies up to 100 eV. For brevity, we shall use the ter-
minology relevant to reaction (4b). For the H− binding en-
ergy we have used the known electron afﬁnity for hydrogen,
εb = 0.754 eV [70]. The cross sections (18) are multiplied by
a factor of 1
4 to account for the fact that H− can only form
if the total electron spin is zero. Also, using using this value
of εb gives B ≈ 0.1936, assuming that ϕ0(r2) = Be−κr2/r2 in
all space. However, the true value of B, extracted from the
asymptotic form of the accurate wave function is 0.3159 [71].
Therefore, we have multiplied the cross sections (18) by a fur-
ther factor of (0.3159/0.1936)2 ≈ 2.66.
Figure 1 compares our calculation for Ps(1s) with the exist-
ing calculations. The computations by McAlinden et al. [64]
were for the reverse reaction (5b), which we have converted
into forward cross sections through the principle of detailed
balance [66]:

These reverse cross sections were obtained from coupled-
channel calculations in which one of the electrons was kept
“frozen” in the 1s state of the H atom. The reaction for Ps(1s)
is endothermic, with a threshold incident Ps energy of 6.05 eV.
The present results and the results of Biswas [55] do not in-
clude the Coulomb interaction between the ion and outgo-
ing positron; hence they show zero cross section at thresh-
old energy. On the other hand, the calculations by Roy and
Sinha [59], McAlinden et al. [64], and Comini et al. [60] do
account for this Coulomb interaction, leading to ﬁnite cross
sections at threshold. As seen in Fig. 1, there are signiﬁcant
discrepancies between the calculations. The present curve is
clearly much higher than those of Biswas [55] and Roy and
Sinha [59]; it is approximately one order of magnitude greater

for Cu [73], 0.107 eV for Zn [14], 0.01 eV for C2H6 [74], and
3× 10−4 eV for CH3F [54]. For a more complete picture, we
also consider a species with the binding energy of 0.04 eV,
e.g., as measured for CH3Br [53].

Figures 4 and 5 show the results for the atoms and
molecules respectively. The cross sections are rather feature-
less, rising rapidly from threshold, in the endothermic case,
and decreasing monotonically past the maximum. The latter
occurs at the Ps energy E ≈ 2Eth for the Ps(ns) states (see be-
low), and even closer to threshold for the nd states. In the
exothermic case the cross sections typically decrease from
threshold. In general, the largest cross section in the incident
Ps energy range studied (0.001–10 eV) is for n ≈ ncrit, i.e., the
value of n for which the positron transfer is resonant, so that
1/4n2 ≈ εb. For n ≥ 3 for the ns states, and n ≥ 4 for the nd
states, one can also see some oscillations superimposed on the
decreasing cross section background. These are caused by an
oscillatory behaviour of the integrand in Eq. (18) and the po-
sitions of its maxima and minima in relation to the integration
limits.

In Figure 6, we compare the quantum-mechanical cross sec-
tions (18) for Cu and CH3F with the corresponding semiclas-
sical cross sections (22) for several values of n. It can be
seen that the agreement is very close for incident Ps ener-
gies (cid:38)0.01 eV, even for low n, and particularly for s states
of Ps. This comparison also shows that for l (cid:28) n the charge-
exchange cross section is almost l independent. The weak
singularity of the semiclassical cross sections for endother-
mic reactions at E = 2Eth coincides with the maximum of the
quantum-mechanical cross sections. In both instances this fea-
ture is related to the dominant contribution of small momenta
p in the case when the lower integration limit in Eqs. (18) and
(21) is zero. As expected, the semiclassical cross sections ob-
tained by using the monotonic classical momentum distribu-
tion (20) do not have the oscillatory pattern of their quantum-
mechanical counterparts.

Figure 7 shows the dependence of the cross sections on
the principal quantum number n of the incident Ps for the
various atoms and molecules, at a ﬁxed incident Ps energy
of 0.1 eV. For systems with larger positron binding energies
this dependence is monotonically decreasing. However, when
the binding energy drops below 0.1 eV [Fig. 7(b)], the n de-
pendence develops a clear maximum. As the principal quan-
tum number increases, the size of the Ps(nl) state, r ∼ 3n2,
becomes large compared to the size of the positron bound
state, r2 ∼ 1/κ = 1/√2εb. The corresponding n is in fact
not so large, e.g., even for the most weakly bound species
(CH3F, εb = 0.3 meV) this occurs for n > 10. This means
that for large n (and sufﬁciently large incident Ps energies),
the charge-transfer process probes the internal Ps motion at
small distances. Since the Ps wave function depends on n as
on n as (cid:101)ψnlm(p) ∝ n−3/2 at large p. Consequently, the cross
ψnlm(r) ∝ n−3/2 at small r [66], its Fourier transform depends
section (18) decreases as σ ∼ n−3 at large n, as seen in Fig. 7.
In the experimental setup, the presence of electric ﬁelds
means that the Ps atom may not be in a pure s or d state,
but in a Stark state, i.e., a superposition of states with differ-
ent l. To estimate the importance of this effect we investigate

B. Predictions for the formation of positron bound states

We now present our cross sections for the formation of
positron bound states in collisions between Rydberg Ps and
atoms (or molecules) that would be used in the experiment.
As explained in Sec. I, the two-step excitation scheme pro-
duces Ps in s and d states, and we carry out calculations for
l = 0, n = 1–20, and l = 2, n = 3–20. The only parameter that
characterizes the positron bound state is its binding energy.
We use the following values: 0.464 eV for Mg [72], 0.170 eV

to which each curve corresponds, consider the incident Ps energy of 10 eV. At this energy, the cross section decreases monotonically with n.
Selected values of n are shown explicitly next to the corresponding curves.

how much the cross sections depend on the orbital quantum
number l of the incident Ps state nl. Figure 8 shows the cross
sections for Cu and C2H6, for ﬁxed n and l = 0, . . . , n− 1. It
can be seen that at low incident Ps energies (e.g., (cid:46)1 eV for
n = 10) the curves for the various values of l are all within
an order of magnitude of each other. This indicates that the
effect of Stark mixing on the cross sections at low energies
is relatively unimportant, i.e., the cross sections for the Stark
states and pure nl states should agree to within an order of
magnitude.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

The experimental production of positron-atom bound states
in the way we propose requires a beam of Rydberg Ps atoms
that is able to interact with the neutral target atoms in a
controlled manner, such that only the bound-state formation
causes an increase in the annihilation rate. The lifetimes of
Rydberg Ps states are determined almost entirely by radia-
tive decay and are twice as long as those of the corresponding
states in hydrogen atoms [75]. Thus, as long as the scattering
cell is sufﬁciently short that no ﬂuorescence is likely to occur
during transit, annihilation events will provide a clear signal
of the formation of positron-atom bound states. This requires
careful control of secondary processes, such as elastic scat-
tering or ionization events that could lead to annihilation fol-
lowing wall collisions. As we discuss in the Appendix, for the
correct choice of experimental parameters the cross sections
for these processes compared to those of the interactions of
interest can be sufﬁciently low that the latter will dominate.

Rydberg Ps beams have recently been utilized in Doppler-
correction [39] and time-of-ﬂight (TOF) experiments [76]. At
UCL we have developed a Rydberg Ps beam for ﬂuorescence
lifetime measurements and also for the implementation of Ps-
atom optics, designed to manipulate the translational motion
of Rydberg states using inhomogeneous electric ﬁelds [41].
Owing to the manner in which the atoms are created, Ps beams
are highly divergent and have correspondingly low transport
efﬁciencies. Focusing such beams with electrostatic lenses is
therefore expected to offer signiﬁcant improvements. Never-
theless, we have been able to produce long-lived Rydberg Ps
atoms that traverse a 0.7 m ﬂight path with ﬂight times up to
∼12 µs. A schematic of this arrangement is shown in Fig. 9.
The apparatus is an extension of a system designed for
laser spectroscopy, with the same Ps production and excitation
methods as described in Ref. [36]. Positrons from a solid-neon
moderated [77] 22Na source are captured in a two-stage Surko
trap [78, 79] operating at 1 Hz. The trap output (∼105 e+ per
cycle) is bunched [80] and magnetically guided through a 45◦
turn into the Ps production region (see Fig. 9).

The positron beam is implanted into a mesoporous SiO2
ﬁlm with an energy E ≈ 2 keV and a time width of ∆t ≈ 4 ns.
This results in the creation of Ps atoms with kinetic energies
of approximately 1 eV, which subsequently cool via collisions
with the internal surfaces of the pores before being emitted
into vacuum. As a result, the average Ps energy is determined
by the incident positron impact energy, until the conﬁnement
energy limit is reached, whereupon the Ps energy becomes
constant [81]. Typically Ps is produced in vacuum with an
overall efﬁciency of ε ∼ 0.3/e+ [82] and longitudinal kinetic
energies in the range 50–500 meV [83]. The bias applied to
an electrode offset 7 mm from the target and orientated par-
allel to its surface determines the electric ﬁeld strength in the
intervening Ps-laser-interaction region, |F| ∼ 0 V cm−1 [84].
For the production of Rydberg Ps it is important to control
the electric ﬁeld in the interaction region as it strongly affects
transitions to the Rydberg states.

The excitation process follows the same two-step scheme
used previously [34, 37], namely, Ps atoms in the 13S state are

The incident positron beam is guided by the magnetic ﬁeld of a
solenoid and series of four coils (black) through an angle of 45◦
to the Ps converter/laser-interaction region. The dotted red (dashed
green) line represent the path of the positrons (Rydberg Ps). The
MCP/phosphor screen assembly is used to align the positron beam
with the target.

driven by UV photons (λ = 243.0 nm) to the 23PJ level (J = 0,
1, 2), and a photon in the range of λ = 760–729 nm (IR) then
drives transition to n ≥ 10. For this system, states up to n = 27
have been resolved [38]. The production of Ps atoms is mon-
itored via annihilation gamma radiation using a fast PbWO4
scintillator optically coupled to a photomultiplier tube (PMT).
This γ-ray detector and the technique of single-shot positron
annihilation lifetime spectroscopy [85] can detect changes in
the average Ps decay rate in different time windows, and since
the decay rates for the Rydberg levels are comparatively small,
the excitation of these states can therefore be inferred in this
way [36, 38].

Ground-state Ps atoms emitted from a mesoporous silica
ﬁlm will typically travel around 1 cm before annihilating. In
order to study Ps interactions with atoms and molecules in a
scattering cell it is therefore advantageous to use relatively en-
ergetic Ps atoms (e.g., Ref. [86]), or to use long-lived Rydberg
Ps which can travel much further before radiative decay and
subsequent annihilation can occur. In our experiments Ps is
detected 0.7 m away from the production region. The proba-
bility of any ground-state atoms traveling this far is entirely
negligible, and indeed we do not detect any events if the IR
laser is off resonance.

Rydberg Ps atoms arriving downstream are detected us-
ing a NaI scintillator, optically coupled to a PMT, located as
shown in Fig. 9. This detector is sensitive to annihilation γ
rays produced from Ps atoms that (1) were emitted from the
ﬁlm within 1.5◦ of normal to its surface, and (2) have been ex-
cited to Rydberg levels able to survive the 2–15 µs ﬂight time.
Considering the solid angle of acceptance (∼2.3 × 10−3 sr)
and coverage of the NaI detector (∼1.7 sr), the background-
subtracted detection rate of 0.02–0.1 Hz equates to production
of roughly (0.2–1.0)× 103 Rydberg Ps per trap cycle, assum-
ing a cosine angular distribution for emission from the ﬁlm,

12

whatever Ps energy distribution is present.

The TOF spectra shown in Fig. 10 indicate that it is al-
ready possible to perform an experiment designed to study
the formation of positron-atom bound states. The most direct
approach would be would be to insert a gas cell in the path of
the Rydberg Ps atoms, as indicated in Fig. 9. This arrangement
could be used to measure the energy thresholds for positron-
molecule–bound-state formation due to charge-exchange col-
lisions with Rydberg Ps. Suppression of the above-threshold
portions of the TOF spectra would be a clear indicator for
such formation and would be highly sensitive to the n state
of the incident Ps. The Rydberg states can be chosen from a
wide range of possible n values simply by varying the IR laser
wavelength [38], and because the mean energy of the Ps beam
can be controlled from a few tens of meV to ∼1 eV, a diverse
range of molecular species are amenable to study in this way.
To investigate positron binding to the atoms discussed in
Sec. III (Cu, Mg, and Zn), lower n states would be preferable,
in order to observe the energy threshold onset. Experiments
conducted so far have focused on producing Rydberg Ps atoms
with n ≥ 10, but the wavelengths required to populate n = 4–9
(λ = 972–767 nm) could be easily achieved using alternative
laser dyes. Nonetheless, as the cross section typically varies
by over two orders of magnitude for n = 10–20 (Sec. III B),
predictable attenuation of the Rydberg Ps beam as a function
of n would be a strong indication of positron-atom–bound-
state formation and could be achieved using our current laser
systems.

The experimental arrangement described here was not orig-
inally designed to study positron-atom/molecule bound states,
and there are several signiﬁcant improvements that could be
made to optimize the system for these measurements. If the
transmitted Rydberg Ps beam is monitored with a microchan-
nel plate (MCP) detector, and the gas cell is observed using a
γ-ray detector, the signal-to-noise ratio would be substantially
improved. Furthermore, there are numerous ways in which
the gas cell could be located much closer to the target than
the arrangement indicated in Fig. 9, which would allow for
signiﬁcantly higher Rydberg Ps beam intensities. Examples
include using a smaller chamber for the positron beam deﬂec-
tion, using a transmission Ps converter (e.g., Ref. [87]), or al-
lowing the incident positron beam to pass through the gas cell
in an inline reﬂection geometry. Such modiﬁcations could in-
troduce complications: it might be necessary to collimate the
Ps beam, more shielding would be required for the detectors,
and the gas cell could potentially cause contamination of the
Ps converter, but these would have to be weighed against the
corresponding increase in count rates.

The cross sections of interest span a wide range, and for ex-
perimentally accessible parameters are generally quite high,
in the range of 103–104πa2
0 (see Figs. 4 and 5). The target
gas pressure required to ensure an interaction through a sin-
gle pass in the scattering cell of length (cid:96) is approximately
1/(σ (cid:96)). A gas cell 5 cm long would allow for efﬁcient de-
tection, with almost 2π solid-angle coverage, and the required
pressure would then be around 5× 10−5 to 5× 10−6 Torr. For
the molecular target gases (Fig. 5) this is relatively easy to
achieve, but for the metals (Fig. 4) it is more complicated and

and neglecting the possibility of in-ﬂight ﬂuorescence or di-
rect annihilation.

Figure 10 shows TOF data recorded using the NaI detec-
tor for n = 18 Ps states. The lasers were triggered to inter-
sect the excitation region at three different times relative to the
positrons being implanted into the ﬁlm. The distribution cor-
responding to the earliest laser time is the hottest of the three
because the Ps atoms that were excited had spent the least
amount of time inside of the ﬁlm before being emitted [83].
The data obtained when the laser was delayed by 10 or 20 ns,
however, show colder Ps distributions. This is because the ir-
radiated atoms are those that have had time to cool in the target
via inelastic collisions within the pore structure, and also be-
cause the fastest atoms have had time to leave the excitation
region.

The data in Fig. 10 illustrate how adjusting the laser de-
lay provides a degree of control over the energy distribution
of the Rydberg Ps. It is also possible to control the the Ps
energy distribution by changing the positron implantation en-
ergy [83]. This provides access to a wider energy range but has
the disadvantage that this method requires tuning the system
in other ways. In general, the positron implantation energy can
be used as a gross selector, while the laser delay can provide
ﬁne tuning of the Ps energy distribution. The former alters the
initial Ps energy distribution according to the cooling in the
mesoporous silica, whereas the latter selects different parts of

pressure of ∼10−5 Torr of Zn or Mg requires heating to 485 K
and 555 K, respectively [88], whereas Cu must be heated to
around 1200 K [89]. These are all experimentally achievable,
although since Zn and Mg are considerably easier to imple-
ment, these would be the focus of initial studies.

The basic measurement process relies on the formation of
bound states to initiate annihilation events that would not oth-
erwise have occurred. However, competing processes must
also be considered, in particular ionization, elastic scattering,
and ground-state Ps formation (see Appendix for some ion-
ization cross section estimates). Any of these could provide a
signal that would be difﬁcult to distinguish from the events we
wish to study. Ionization could be monitored by controlling
the electric ﬁeld in the gas cell. If free positrons are present
they can be extracted from the cell, and hence not counted as
a spurious signal. If Rydberg Ps atoms undergo elastic scatter-
ing or Ps formation they may nevertheless be detected follow-
ing collisions with the cell or direct annihilation.

Both experiments [90] and calculations [91] show that
ground state Ps atoms interact with total cross sections sim-
ilar to those of equivelocity electrons. The upper limit for the
Rydberg Ps ionization cross section is set by the sum of the
equivelocity electron and positron total scattering cross sec-
tions, and drops off rapidly close to threshold, as shown in
Fig. 11. Thus, we would expect that in the appropriate low-
energy range, the bound-state formation cross sections rele-
vant to the proposed experiment may be considerably larger
than those of any other process that could give rise to an in-
creased annihilation signal (see Appendix). This will have to
be veriﬁed by experiment, however, since the calculated cross
sections are estimates, and no total cross section data for the
particular target atoms to be studied are currently available.

V. CONCLUSIONS

A new experiment has been proposed to detect the existence
of positron-atom bound states. This would be achieved by ob-
serving the charge-transfer reaction (2), with the incident Ps
in a Rydberg state. We have provided theoretical estimates for
the cross section of this reaction. By comparing these with ex-
perimental data, it may be possible to infer a positron-atom
binding energy, and compare it with existing theoretical pre-
dictions [12–14].

Our calculations were performed in the ﬁrst Born approx-
imation. The problem was reduced analytically to a one-
dimensional integral involving the internal Ps(nl) wave func-
tion in momentum space, and this integral was evaluated nu-
merically. Using the semiclassical approximation, we also ob-
tained a simple analytical expression for the cross section for
l (cid:28) n. The method was applied to Ps-H collisions leading
to H−, and results were found to be in accord with existing
calculations. Estimates of cross sections were then given for
positron binding to Mg, Cu, Zn, C2H6, CH3F, and CH3Br.
In general, the largest cross section in the incident Ps energy
range considered (0.001–10 eV) is obtained for n ∼ 1/√4εb,
i.e., the value of n for which the positron transfer is resonant.

13

At large n and sufﬁciently large incident Ps energies, the cross
section σ depends on the Ps principal quantum number n as
σ ∝ 1/n3.

There are some important points to note about our theoreti-

cal calculations.

1. The outgoing electron is treated as a plane wave. To ac-
count for the attractive Coulomb ﬁeld of the positron-
atom complex, one can describe the outgoing elec-
tron by using a Coulomb wave. This would lead to ﬁ-
nite cross sections at threshold energy, but would make
the calculation more cumbersome. We expect that the
Coulomb interaction would be important only for low
outgoing electron energies, k2/2 (cid:46) 1/2n2.

2. The perturbation V (r2) only accounts for the interac-
tion of the positron with the atom; in principle one
should also include the interaction of the electron with
the atom. However, its effect on the formation of the
positron-atom bound state is expected to be compara-
tively small since Rydberg Ps is a diffuse object.

3. The wave function of the positron bound state used
in the derivation is valid for binding with atoms or
molecules with ionization potentials I > 6.8 eV, in
which this state is asymptotically described as a loosely
bound positron. For atoms with I < 6.8 eV, the asymp-
totic wave function corresponds to Ps(1s) bound to the
positive ion. However, these states contain a ‘positron-
atom component,’ and we believe that the present cross
sections can be used for them as order-of-magnitude es-
timates.

4. The presence of electric ﬁelds in the experimental setup
will lead to Stark mixing of the Ps states. Here we have
considered brieﬂy the dependence of the cross sections
on the value of l and found that at low Ps energies the
cross sections for different l agree to within an order
of magnitude. Theoretically, it is feasible to account for
the Stark effect rigorously by using the internal Ps wave
functions in parabolic coordinates.

Notwithstanding the approximations that have been made,
the good agreement with existing calculations for Ps-H col-
lisions is encouraging. It indicates that the computed cross
sections for the Rydberg-state-Ps–atom collisions are valid to
within an order of magnitude or better. Measurements of ab-
solute cross sections would be possible with the molecular tar-
gets, all of which are gaseous at room temperature. However,
owing to large uncertainties in the target number density in
hot cells (e.g., Ref. [92]) it is likely that only relative cross
sections could be measured for the metal targets.

Relative cross section measurements could in principle be
normalized using accurate calculations, although the applica-
bility of such calculations might be compromised by incom-
plete knowledge of the Rydberg Stark states produced in the
experiment, since they are highly sensitive to stray ﬁelds [93].
Moreover, it is possible that the presence of a background ion-
ized gas of metal atoms in the hot cell will generate large

variations in the potential that cannot be controlled or accu-
rately measured, making it impossible to produce well-deﬁned
Rydberg Stark states. The extent to which this occurs could
be monitored using high-n Ps states, or possibly a secondary
beam of Rydberg He atoms, to probe the electric ﬁeld in the
cell [94].

The count rates for our experiments, neglecting improve-
ments obtained by reconﬁguring the apparatus (which would
likely be substantial), would be the same as those obtained
when measuring the TOF distributions shown in Fig. 10, each
of which can be recorded in around 8–10 hours. The mea-
surements would consist of obtaining such spectra for various
different conditions (i.e., varying n and the initial velocity dis-
tributions) with and without the target gas present. Thus, we
would expect to obtain a complete data set sufﬁcient to deter-
mine if bound states have been produced (including null tests
and veriﬁcations) in approximately one week for each target
gas.

where (cid:101)ψnlm and (cid:101)ψ f are the internal wave functions of the inci-

respectively, and ∆K = K(cid:48) − K is the difference between the
ﬁnal and initial Ps center-of-mass momenta K(cid:48) and K.
The typical electron and positron momenta within Ps(nl)
are small, ∼1/n. This means that for small incident Ps mo-
menta K (cid:28) 1 a.u., the initial and ﬁnal electron and positron
momenta in the amplitudes fe and fp are also small. Hence,
we can approximate these amplitudes by their s-wave contri-
butions and take them in the limit ke,p → 0 for the simplest
estimate:

tion as a plane wave: ψ f (r1 − r2) = exp[ik· (r1 − r2)]. Then

Because of the small binding energy of Ps(nl), its constituent

their interaction with the target. This allows one to use the

As the Rydberg Ps in the experiment described in Sec. IV is
produced mainly in s and d states, we consider the cases l = 0
and l = 2. Integrating the differential cross section (A.7) and
using the same variable substitution that led to Eq. (18), we

As the impulse approximation is valid in the limit of large n
and low K, the cross section was computed numerically for
n = 5–20 with incident Ps energies ≤1 eV. It was found that
the contribution of the interference term [the second term in
square brackets in Eq. (A.8)] is negligible. This is caused by
the oscillatory behaviour of Fn0(p), which suppresses the in-
tegral I1(k), Eq. (A.9a). Hence, we calculated the total cross
section for l = 2 from Eq. (A.8) without the interference term,
using Fn2 instead of Fn0 in Eq. (A.9b). Neglecting the interfer-
ence term also allows one to derive the ionization cross sec-
tion in the semiclassical approximation, by using the classical
momentum distribution (20) instead of |Fnl(p)|2 p2 for l (cid:28) n
(cf. Sec. II B).
The positron-atom scattering length a+ can be estimated
from the known binding energy through a+ ≈ −1/√2εb [66].

FIG. 11. Ionization cross sections for Ps(nl) collisions with Cu: solid
curves, l = 0 [Eq. (A.8)]; dashed curves, l = 2 [Eq. (A.8) without the
interference term and with Fn2 used in (A.9b) instead of Fn0]; dotted
curves, results obtained from Eq. (A.8) neglecting the interference
term and using the classical momentum distribution (20) instead of
|Fn0(p)|2 p2. The values of n are shown next to the curves.

The e−-A scattering length can similarly be estimated from the
target’s electron afﬁnity (EA) [99]. Since the positron binding
energy is usually small, the positron contribution to the ion-
ization cross section dominates.

As an example, Fig. 11 shows ionization cross sections for
Ps collisions with the Cu atom for l = 0 (with interference)
and l = 2 (without interference), as well as the semiclassical
result. We take the electron afﬁnity to be 1.235 eV [100]. The
cross sections for l = 0 and l = 2 are almost indistinguishable,
except for the lowest principle quantum number n = 5. In the
scale of Fig. 11, the semiclassical cross section for l = 0 is
identical to the quantum calculation, which conﬁrms that the
interference term is negligible.

old, and in the limit of large Ps energy they become con-
stant. The value of the cross section at large K (though still
(cid:28)1 a.u.) may be determined as follows. The typical electron
and positron momenta in the Ps Rydberg state nlm are small
(∼1/n), so for K (cid:29) 1/n one can replace the corresponding
momentum-space densities by the delta functions. Neglecting
(cid:19)(cid:21)
interference, Eq. (A.5) gives

sum of the electron-atom and positron-atom (elastic) scatter-
ing cross sections, σ = σ− + σ+. Unlike Eq. (A.10), this lat-
ter result is valid for any Ps momentum K. Instead of having
a plateau, the ionization cross section will then decrease with
the Ps energy, following the decrease of the positron and elec-
tron cross sections σ±.
For Cu, supposing the incident Ps has an energy of 0.05 eV,
for n = 15 the ionization cross section is estimated to be
about 25πa2
0, while the charge-transfer cross section is ap-
proximately 125πa2
0, i.e., much greater. Depending on the Ps
energy and the value of n, this may or may not be the case, but
we have shown that there should be a ‘window’ of Ps energies
and values of n where charge transfer is the dominant pro-
cess. In particular, it appears that for the Ps principal quantum
numbers for which the charge-transfer cross section is largest,
it is also much greater than the corresponding ionization cross
section, making the proposed detection scheme feasible.

[50] For atoms with positive electron afﬁnities, another possible
charge transfer reaction is Ps + A → A− + e+. Formation of
the negative Ps ion, with binding energy 0.326 eV [101],
Ps + A → Ps− + A+, may also occur, though likely with very
small probability for high-n Rydberg Ps.
