Identiﬁcation of the relaxation kernel in

diﬀusion processes and viscoelasticity with

memory via deconvolution∗

L. Pandolﬁ†

March 15, 2016

Abstract: We present an algorithm for the identiﬁcation of the relax-
ation kernel in the theory of diﬀusion systems with memory (or of viscoelas-
ticity) which is linear, in the sense that we propose a linear Volterra integral
equation of convolution type whose solution is the relaxation kernel. The al-
gorithm is based on the observation of the ﬂux through a part of the boundary
of a body.

encountered in the study of diﬀusion processes in the presence of complex
molecular structures (w = w(x, t) is the concentration, see [2, 6]) or in ther-
modynamics of materials with memory (w is the temperature, see [1, 20]).
It is also encountered in viscoelasticity, usually written as

w′′ = N(0)w(x, t) +Z t

0

N ′(t − s)∆w(s) ds

(here w is the displacement, see [20]).

In order to ﬁx the terminology, in this paper we refer to the applications
In this context, we
to thermodynamics, and w will be the temperature.
recall that Eq. (1.1) is derived from conservation of energy and a material
property for the ﬂux, which takes into account that the ﬂux does not react
instantaneously to the gradient of the temperature, as assumed by the Fourier
law. Rather, it is assumed that the (density of the) ﬂux at position x and
time t is given by

q(x, t) = −Z t

0

N(t − s)∇w(x, s) ds.

(1.2)

This material property was ﬁrst introduced by Maxwell in [17] (with N(t) =
ae−bt, see also [4]) and in the general form by Gurtin and Pipkin in [12].

Dissipation of energy and the second principle of thermodynamics impose
certain restrictions to the relaxation kernel N(t) (see [5, 8]) which however
is largely unknown and has to be estimated using suitable experiments on
samples of the material. For this reason, identiﬁcation of N(t) in suitable
classes of functions has been widely studied both by engineers and by math-
ematicians. See comments and references in [21]. We note that N(t) in our
model does not depend on x and this is an explicit assumption that the ma-
terial under examination is homogeneous and isotropic. In this case, N(t)
does not depend on the shape of the sample of the material and it can be
identiﬁed using experiments on samples with the simplest possible geome-
try: a bar. Usually, engineering papers (and also our previous paper [21])
study this case Ω = (a, b). It is a fact however that in nondestructive tests,
w = w(x, t) where x ∈ Ω ⊆ IRd and Ω is a bounded region (in the cases of
physical interest d ≤ 3). In fact, the study of kernel identiﬁcation in most
of the mathematical papers allows d > 1. The methods usually proposed
in these papers lead to the investigation of a system of nonlinear partial
diﬀerential equations with memory in the unknowns w and N (see [1, 16]).

2

In our previous paper [21] we noted that using two measures it is possible
to identify the kernel N(t) as the solution of a standard deconvolution prob-
lem, i.e. the solution of a linear Volterra integral equation of the ﬁrst kind
for the unknown function N(t). The identiﬁcation algorithm was proposed
in [21] in the case d = 1. Our goal now is the extension of the method to the
case d > 1, a case of interest in nondestructive testing.

It was noted in [11] that, thanks to the convolution structure of sys-
tem (1.1), if the pair (N(t), w(t)) has been identiﬁed on an initial interval
(0, τ ) then the identiﬁcation of (N(t), w(t)) for t > τ is indeed a linear prob-
lem. Our goal can be seen also as removing the ﬁrst nonlinear step on [0, τ ]
(an interval which in practice cannot be so short to avoid numerical and
experimental instabilities). Observe however that the algorithm we propose
does not need the explicit computation of w(t).

Finally we note that the method we are using for kernel identiﬁcation
has been suggested by our study of controllability. A diﬀerent identiﬁcation
problem whose solution depends on controllability is in [19].

1.1 The assumptions

The assumptions in this papers concern both N(t) and the region Ω. We
assume that ∂Ω is of class C 2 (see also the comments in Section 3). We
single out two (relatively open) subsets ˆΓ and ˜Γ of ∂Ω such that

cl ˆΓ ∩ cl ˜Γ = ∅ .

The part ˜Γ of the boundary is the part over which the ﬂux is observed.
As to the kernel N(t) we assume that it is smooth (of class C 2) and
N(0) > 0. The restrictions imposed by dissipativity and thermodynamics,
in particular N(t) decreasing, can be used for numerical pourposes (see [21])
but are not explicitly used in the algorithm. However, we shall see that
stability of the null solution of Eq. (1.1) (which is not an assumption of the
identiﬁcation algorithm) has a practical role in identiﬁcation too.

Abel kernels, like N(t) = at−b, a > 0, b > 0, are excluded by the regularity

assumption.

We contrast these assumptions with most of the engineering literature,
where it is assumed that dim Ω = 1 and that the kernel N(t) depends on
“few” parameters; system (1.1) is numerically solved and then the “real”
values of the parameters are chosen as the ones which give a minimum dis-
crepancy from experimental data, see [3].

3

It is a fact that when N ∈ C 2 then system (1.1) with conditions

w(x, 0) = ξ(x) , w(x, t) = f (x, t) x ∈ ∂Ω

is solvable for every ξ ∈ L2(Ω) and f ∈ L2(∂Ω×(0, T )) and w ∈ C([0, T ]; L2(Ω))×
C 1([0, T ]; H −1(Ω)) (see [20]).

Finally, let us note a consequence of the assumption N(0) > 0: variations

of the temperature propagates with ﬁnite speed pN(0) (in every direction,

like in the wave equation, see [7, 20]).

2 Notations and informal description of the

algorithm

We ﬁx some notations: points of ∂Ω are denoted x and dσ is the surface
measure; the points of ˆΓ or ˜Γ are denoted respectively ˆx and ˜x and dˆΓ, d˜Γ
the corresponding measures; Σ = ∂Ω × (0, T ), ˆΣ = ˆΓ × (0, T ) ˜Σ = ˜Γ × (0, T )
with measures dΣ, d ˆΣ, d ˜Σ.

The exterior normal derivative on ∂Ω is denoted γ1.
We describe informally the algorithm, which consists in two measures of

the ﬂux throughout ˜Γ.

Every observation is an average against a weighting function m(x) which
depends on the instrument. So, we assume that m(x) (with support in ˜Γ) is
given. The observations give functions

t 7→Z˜Γ

m(˜x)γ1w(˜x, t) d˜Γ .

A ﬁrst measure is obtained as follows. We ﬁx w(x, t) = 0 on ∂Ω and

w(x, 0) = ξ(x). We measure the corresponding ﬂux on ˜Γ.

A second measure is obtained as follows. We ﬁx w(x, 0) to a known value
(without restriction, w(x, 0) = 0) and we impose the temperature f (ˆx, t) on
ˆΓ. We choose

f (ˆx, t) = f0(ˆx)f1(t) ,

f1(t) =Z t

0

g(s) ds .

(2.1)

Note that the condition f (ˆx, 0) = 0 is consistent with w(x, 0) = 0. We
measure the corresponding ﬂux on ˜Γ, using the same instrument, i.e. with
the same weight function m(x).

4

We get respectively

yξ(t) =Z˜Γ

m(˜x)q(˜x, t) d˜Γ ,

Y f (t) =Z˜Γ

m(˜x)q(˜x, t) d˜Γ .

It turns out that

Y f (t) =Z t

0

H(t − s)N(s) ds +Z t

0

g(t − s)yξ0(s) ds

where H(t) can be computed and ξ0 is a special (easily realizable) initial
condition so that yξ0 can be measured. So, the determination of the relaxation
kernel N(t) boils down to solve this Volterra integral equation of the ﬁrst kind
in the unknown N(t), hence to a linear deconvolution problem.

As a last remark, we note that not every instrument for the measure of
the ﬂux will do (surely if m = 0, i.e. the instrument observes nothing and
no reconstruction is possible). The condition on m(˜x) is described in (3.6).

3 Justiﬁcation of the algorithm

We introduce the operator A in L2(Ω),

domA = H 2(Ω) ∩ H 1

0 (Ω) ,

Aφ = ∆φ

and an orthonormal basis {φn} of L2(Ω) of eigenvectors, Aφn = −λ2
nφn.
We expand the solutions of (1.1) with w(x, 0) = ξ(x) and zero boundary
temperature is series of the eigenfunctions φn:

w(x, t) =

+∞

Xn=1

φn(x)wn(t) ,

ξ(x) =

+∞

Xn=1

ξnφn(x) .

(3.1)

First we study yξ(t).

It is easily seen that wn(t) solves

w′

n(t) = −λ2

N(t − s)wn(s) ds ,

wn(0) = ξn .

So we have

wn(t) = zn(t)ξn

(3.2)

The series in the bracket converges in L2(0, T ; L2(˜Γ)) for every T > 0 and

ξ ∈ L2(Ω). The proof is in the Appendix.

Now we study Yf (t). We impose the initial condition w(x, 0) = 0 and we
compute the inner product in L2(Ω) of both the sides of (1.1) with φn(x).
We use Green formula and we get the following equation for wn(t) in (3.1):

w′

n(t) = −λ2

nZ t

N(t − s)wn(s) ds −Z t

N(t − s)(cid:20)ZˆΓ

and wn(0) = 0. We use f (x, t) = f0(ˆx)f1(t) in (2.1) and we deﬁne

f0,n =(cid:20)ZˆΓ

γ1φn(ˆx)f0(ˆx) dˆΓ(cid:21) .

Then we have

w′

n(t) = −λ2

It is proved (for example in [18, 20]) that the series of w(x, t) converges in
C(0, T ; L2(Ω)). In order to justify the distribution of the series on the sum,
it is suﬃcient to note that the ﬁrst series on the right hand side converges in
L2(Ω). This is indeed true since

u0(x) =

(3.3)
It is known that u0(x) ∈ H 1/2(Ω) ⊆ L2(Ω) and the series converges in this
space.

(3.4)

The convergence in L2(0, T ; L2(˜Γ)) of the series in the bracket is in the ap-
pendix.

We compare the last bracket with (3.2) and we see that

So, once the measure yξ0(s) is known, identiﬁcation of N(t) is reduced to a
standard deconvolution problem, provided that we can give a meaning to

and provided that

This last propery is a property of the instrument used for the measure and
we assume that it is satisﬁed.

m(˜x)γ1u0(˜x) d˜Γ(cid:21) 6= 0 .

(3.5)

(3.6)

We comment the conditions under which the integral (3.5) makes
sense. This depends on the smoothness of ∂Ω, of the weight m(˜x) and of
f e
0 (x).

When f e

0 ∈ L2(Ω) ( deﬁned in (3.3) then we have u0 ∈ H 1/2(Ω) ⊆ L2(Ω)
and ∆u0 = 0 ∈ L2(Ω). Then we have γ1u0 ∈ H −3/2(Γ) (see [15, Ch. 2]) and
the bracket is well deﬁned if m(x) is smooth, m ∈ H 3/2(Ω). This also in the
case that ˆΓ and ˜Γ do intersect. But, we can also take advantage of the fact
that clˆΓ ∩ cl˜Γ = ∅.

i.e. ∂Ω ∈ C 2,α (any α > 0).

We assume more regularity of ∂Ω,

If
0 is bounded, problem (3.3) admits a solution which is continuous on ˜Γ
f e
0 is zero, hence continuous on ˜Γ because
(see [9, Lemma 2.13]) (note that f e
cl ˆΓ ∩ cl ˜Γ = ∅). Moreover, it follows from [9, Lemma 6.18] that γ1u(˜x) is
continuous on ˜Γ and (3.5) makes sense for every m0 ∈ L2(˜Γ), in particular if
it is the characteristic function of a subset of ˜Γ.

A remark is in order here: [9, Lemma 6.18] assumes u ∈ C(cl Ω) but, as
simply seen from the proof and explicitly stated at [9, p. 106], the result
holds also if u is continuous on Ω1 where Ω1 ⊆ Ω is such that ˜Γ ⊆ ∂Ω1. The
region Ω1 exists because cl ˆΓ ∩ cl ˜Γ = ∅.

On the initial condition ξ0 = u0. A ﬁnal point has to be settled.
While it is technically reasonable to impose boundary conditions which are
more or less arbitrary, it is not such an easy task to impose an initial condition
unless it has some special property. In fact, the material has to be prepared
to a certain temperature distribution and then released to evolve freely for
t larger then an “initial” time, without restriction for t > 0. This is in
general diﬃcult. But, we are interested here to the special initial condition
ξ0(x) = u0(x) and this initial condition can be easily achieved if system (1.1)
is stable, i.e.
if for every ξ the corresponding solution (with zero boundary
temperature) w(t) → 0 in L2(Ω), for t → +∞ (as it usually happens in
practice since the memory kernel N(t) dissipates enough energy).
In this
case the initial condition ξ0 can easily be imposed since ξ0 = u0 solves (3.3).
To see this, let us consider Eq. (1.1) with w(x, 0) = 0 and

w(x, t) = f e

0 (x) x ∈ ∂Ω

(note that the boundary condition is constant in time).

The function

η(x, t) = w(x, t) − ξ0(x) = w(x, t) − u0(x)

9

solves Eq. (1.1) with the boundary condition put equal zero and the initial
condition equal to ξ0.

Stability implies limt→+∞ η(·, t) = 0 in L2(Ω) so that

lim
t→+∞

w(x, t) = ξ0(x) :

in order to realize the special initial condition ξ0 it is suﬃcient to apply the
boundary temperature f e
0 (constant in time) to the body, for a time large
enough, after which the heated external source is removed and the measure
yξ0(t) can be taken.

4 Appendix: the series (3.2)

We need few information. A sequence {en} in a (real or complex) Hilbert
space is a Riesz sequence if it can be transformed to an orthonormal basis
(possibly of a Hilbert space of diﬀerent dimension) using a linear bounded
and boundedly invertible transformation (see [10, 20] for Riesz sequences).
It is a fact that when {en} is a Riesz sequence then the series

+∞

hnen

(4.1)

Xn=1

converges if and only if {hn} ∈ l2 and the sum does not depend on the order
of the elements of the series.

Let {en} be a sequence in a Hilbert space H. We associate to this sequence

the moment operator M: H 7→ l2

Mh = {hh, eni}

(here h·, ·i denotes the inner product in H). The sequence {en} is a Riesz
sequence if and only if the operator M is continuous and surjective.

We recall our goal, which is the proof of the convergence in L2(˜Γ × (0, T ))

of the series in (3.2), i.e.

+∞

Xn=1

ξn (γ1φn)Z t

N(t − s)zn(s) ds .

(4.2)

We prove convergence in L2(∂Ω × (0, T )) for every T > 0. This property
depends on the fact that system (1.1) is controllable in L2(Ω) using controls

10

f ∈ L2(∂Ω × (0, T )) for T large enough. Namely, there exists a time T0
such that for every ξ ∈ L2(Ω) there exists f ∈ L2(∂Ω × (0, T0)) such that
w(T0) = ξ (the initial condition is zero and we assume w = f on ∂Ω). Using
similar arguments as in the study of Yf (t), we expand w(x, t) in series of the
eigenfunctions φn(x),

w(x, t) =

Here {ξn} is an arbitrary l2 sequence.

The fact that f 7→ w is a linear continuous transformation from L2(∂Ω ×
(0, T0)) to C([0, T0]; L2(Ω)) implies that the moment operator M is continu-
ous from L2(∂Ω × (0, T0)) to l2, and controllability shows that it is surjective.
So, the sequence of functions

(cid:26)γ1φnZ s

In particular, it converges in L2(˜Γ × (0, T )) and this argument applies in

particular to the series (3.4).
