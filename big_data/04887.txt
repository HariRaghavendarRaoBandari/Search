AND FAMILIES OF LATT `ES MAPS OF Pk

THOMAS GAUTHIER, BENJAMIN HUTZ, AND SCOTT KASCHNER

Abstract. In this paper we study properties of endomorphisms of Pk using a symmetric product
construction (P1)k/Sk
‚àº= Pk. Symmetric products have been used to produce examples of endo-
morphisms of Pk with certain characteristics, k ‚â• 2. In the present note, we discuss the use of these
maps to enlighten arithmetic phenomena and stability phenomena in parameter spaces. In partic-
ular, we study notions of uniform boundedness of rational preperiodic points via good reduction
information, k-deep postcritically Ô¨Ånite maps, and characterize families of Latt`es maps.

Introduction

In this paper we study dynamical properties of endomorphisms of Pk, both from the arithmetic
and the complex point of view. We mainly focus on the dynamics of a symmetric product construc-
tion (P1)k/Sk ‚àº= Pk. Symmetric products have been used to produce examples of endomorphisms of
Pk with certain characteristics when k ‚â• 2 and their dynamics over the Ô¨Åeld C of complex numbers
is rather simple and completely understood (see [DS, FS, U], for example). In the present note,
we discuss the use of these maps to enlighten arithmetic phenomena and stability phenomena in
parameter spaces. In particular, we study notions of uniform boundedness of rational preperiodic
points via good reduction information, k-deep postcritically Ô¨Ånite maps, and characterize families
of Latt`es maps (in particular those containing symmetric products).

Let d ‚â• 2 be an integer. We denote by Homd(Pk) the space of holomorphic endomorphisms of
Pk of degree d. The space Homd(Pk) is known to be a smooth irreducible quasi-projective variety
of dimension Nd(k) := (k + 1) (d+k)!
d!¬∑k! ‚àí 1. More precisely, it can be identiÔ¨Åed with an irreducible
Zariski open set of PNd(k), see e.g. [BB, ¬ß1.1].

Here, we mainly investigate properties of the following construction.

DeÔ¨Ånition 1. For any f ‚àà Homd(P1), we deÔ¨Åne the k-symmetric product of f as the rational
mapping F : Pk 99K Pk making the following diagram commute

In Section 1 we prove various basic properties of the dynamics of the map F in relation to f .
Most of the properties we give seem classical. On the other hand, we did not Ô¨Ånd any reference
for the arithmetic properties we need. In the remaining sections, we apply this construction to the
three following problems.

those obtained as k-symmetric products.

The Morton-Silverman Conjecture for symmetric products.

Given a map f ‚àà Homd(Pk), we deÔ¨Åne the preperiodic points to be those with Ô¨Ånite forward
orbit. Morton and Silverman conjectured the existence of a constant C bounding the number of
rational preperiodic points deÔ¨Åned over a number Ô¨Åeld of degree at most D that depends only on
d, D, and k. More precisely, they proposed the following conjecture.
Conjecture (Morton-Silverman [MS]). Let d ‚â• 2 be an integer and D, k ‚â• 1 be integers. There
exists a constant C depending on d, D, and k such that for any morphism f ‚àà Homd(Pk) the
number of preperiodic points deÔ¨Åned over a number Ô¨Åeld of degree at most D is bounded by C.

This conjecture is open as stated; however some progress has been made under additional hy-
potheses, such as assuming that f has good reduction at a certain prime [B, H1]. We say that f
has good reduction at a prime p if f modulo p is a morphism of the same degree as f . In Section
2, we prove the following theorem in relation to this problem.
Theorem 2. Let d ‚â• 2 be an integer and k ‚â• 1 be an integer. Let K be a number Ô¨Åeld and p ‚àà K
be a prime. Let f ‚àà Homd(P1) deÔ¨Åned over K with good reduction at p.

(1) Let P be a periodic point of minimal period n for f deÔ¨Åned over a Galois extension of degree

k of K. Then,

(2) If we assume the existence of a uniform Morton-Silverman constant over K for the k-
symmetric product of f as CF (K), then we can bound the number of rational preperiodic
points over any Galois extension of degree at most k as

C ‚â§ k ¬∑ CF (K).

The Ô¨Årst part of Theorem 2 is similar to the bound from [H1], which allows f to be deÔ¨Åned
over the Ô¨Åeld extension. Which bound is better depends on the properties of p and value of k.
The second part shows that one need only consider the preperiodic points deÔ¨Åned over the Ô¨Åeld
of deÔ¨Ånition of the map for uniform boundedness in P1 and implies a linear growth in number of
rational preperiodic points with respect to the degree of the Ô¨Åeld of deÔ¨Ånition of the points for a
Ô¨Åxed degree of the Ô¨Åeld of deÔ¨Ånition for the map.

Additionally, this construction provides a way to determine rational preperiodic points of Ô¨Åelds
of bounded degree using the algorithm from [H2]. We give examples of a quadratic polynomial
with 21 rational preperiodic points over a degree 3 number Ô¨Åeld and a quadratic polynomial with
a rational 5-cycle over a degree 5 number Ô¨Åeld (see Example 1 and Example 2). Finally, we use the
k-symmetric product to give an algorithm to compute canonical heights of number Ô¨Åelds where all
of the computations are performed over Q.1

Postcritically Ô¨Ånite symmetric products.

In Section 3 we consider another problem. Recall that F ‚àà Homd(Pk) is postcritically Ô¨Ånite if

the postcritical set of F

P(F ) := [n‚â•1

F n(C(F )) ,

i.e., the forward orbit of C(F ), the critical locus of F , is a strict algebraic subvariety of Pk.
DeÔ¨Ånition 3. We say that F ‚àà Homd(Pk) is 1-deep postcritically Ô¨Ånite if F is postcritically Ô¨Ånite
and F(1) := F|CF is postcritically Ô¨Ånite, meaning the orbit under iteration of F of the critical locus
C(F(1)) of F(1) is an algebraic subvariety of pure codimension 2.
We say that F is (j + 1)-deep postcritically Ô¨Ånite if it is j-deep postcritically Ô¨Ånite and F(j+1) :=
F|C(F(j)) is postcritically Ô¨Ånite.

We say that F is strongly postcritically Ô¨Ånite if it is (k ‚àí 1)-deep postcritically Ô¨Ånite.
Be aware that the notion of j-deep postcritically Ô¨Ånite map diÔ¨Äers from the notion of j-critically
Ô¨Ånite map deÔ¨Åned by Jonsson [J]. Indeed, in his deÔ¨Ånition Jonsson requires critical points to be
non-recurrent, hence non-periodic. We don‚Äôt exclude that possibility.

We focus on the following problem.

Question. Is a postcritically Ô¨Ånite endomorphism of Pk necessarily strongly postcritically Ô¨Ånite?

In the case when F is a symmetric product, we give a positive answer to this question. This
answers a question posed during the American Institute of Mathematics workshop Postcritically
Ô¨Ånite maps in complex and arithmetic dynamics in the speciÔ¨Åc case of symmetric products.

Namely, we prove the following theorem.

Theorem 4. Let f ‚àà Homd(P1) and F be the k-symmetric product of f for k ‚â• 2. Then F is
strongly postcritically Ô¨Ånite if and only if F is postcritically Ô¨Ånite if and only if f is postcritically
Ô¨Ånite.

We also provide a one-parameter family of degree 4 rational mappings Fa : P2 99K P2 that are

postcritically Ô¨Ånite but not strongly postcritically Ô¨Ånite.

Families of Latt`es maps of Pk.

Denote by Md(Pk) the moduli space of endomorphisms of Pk with algebraic degree d, i.e. the
set of PGL(k + 1) conjugacy classes of the space of degree d endomorphisms Homd(Pk). The space
Md(Pk) has been proven to have good geometric properties by Levy [L].

1The canonical height application was suggested by Joseph Silverman at the ICERM semester on complex and

arithmetic dynamics in 2010.

In Section 4 we examine families of Latt`es maps in the moduli space Md(Pk) of degree d endo-
morphisms of Pk. Our aim here is to have a complete description of non-trivial families of Latt`es
maps of Pk when k ‚â• 2: an endomorphism f : Pk ‚àí‚Üí Pk is a Latt`es map if there exists an abelian
variety T of dimension k, an aÔ¨Éne map D : T ‚àí‚Üí T and a Ô¨Ånite branched cover Œò : T ‚àí‚Üí Pk
such that the following diagramm commutes

The complex dynamics of Latt`es maps has been deeply studied in several beautiful papers (see
e.g. [Mi, Z, BL1, BL2, BD1, Du]). The families and the perturbations of Latt`es maps of P1 are also
quite completely understood (see [Mi, BB, BG]).

Recall also that a family of degree d endomorphisms of Pk is a morphism f : Œõ√óPk ‚àí‚Üí Pk, where
Œõ is a quasiprojective varierty of dimension m ‚â• 1 and for all Œª ‚àà Œõ, the map fŒª := f (Œª,¬∑) : Pk ‚àí‚Üí
Pk is an endomorphism of algebraic degree d. Equivalently, the map Œª ‚àà Œõ 7‚àí‚Üí fŒª ‚àà Homd(Pk)
if there exists a
is a morphism of quasiprojective varieties. We also say that (fŒª)Œª‚ààŒõ is trivial
holomorphic map Œª ‚àà Œõ 7‚àí‚Üí mŒª ‚àà PGL(k + 1, C) and Œª0 ‚àà Œõ such that

Œª ‚ó¶ fŒª0 ‚ó¶ mŒª , Œª ‚àà Œõ .
Denote by Œ† : Homd(Pk) ‚Üí Md(Pk) be the canonical projection.
DeÔ¨Ånition 5. When (fŒª)Œª‚ààŒõ is a family of endomorphisms of Pk, we say that it has dimension
q in moduli if the set {Œ†(fŒª) ; Œª ‚àà Œõ} is an analytic set of Md(Pk) of dimension q. We then set
dimM(fŒª, Œõ) := q.

fŒª = m‚àí1

We focus on maximal families of Latt`es maps containing a speciÔ¨Åc Latt`es map f .

DeÔ¨Ånition 6. A family (fŒª)Œª‚ààŒõ of Latt`es maps of Pk containing f ‚àà Md(Pk) is maximal if for
any family (ft)t‚ààX of Latt`es maps containing also f , we have dimM(fŒª, Œõ) ‚â• dimM(ft, X).

When k = 1, the families of Latt`es maps have been completely classiÔ¨Åed by Milnor [Mi]. He
proves that a family (ft) of Latt`es maps of P1 has positive dimension in moduli, i.e. is non-trivial,
if and only if d = a2 is the square of an integer a ‚â• 2 and the aÔ¨Éne map inducing any map ft0 is
of the form z 7‚Üí az + b. We aim here at giving a generalization of that precise statement.

Our main result on this problem is the following.

Theorem 7. Let f ‚àà Md(Pk) be a Latt`es map and let D be an isogeny inducing f . Then, the
dimension in moduli of any family (fŒª)Œª‚ààŒõ of Latt`es maps containing f satisÔ¨Åes dimM(fŒª, Œõ) ‚â§
k(k + 1)/2. More precisely, if (fŒª)Œª‚ààŒõ is a maximal family containing f , then

(1) either the family is trivial, i.e. dimM(fŒª, Œõ) = 0, in which case the eigenspaces of the linear
part of D associated with ‚àöd and ‚àí‚àöd are trivial,
(2) or dimM(fŒª, Œõ) = q > 0, in which case ‚àöd is an integer and the linear part of D has
eigenspaces associated with ‚àöd and ‚àí‚àöd of respective dimensions q+ and q‚àí with (q+ +
q‚àí) ¬∑ q++q‚àí

2 = q for any Œª ‚àà Œõ.

Beware that this result provides examples of families which are stable in the sense of Berteloot-
Bianchi-Dupont [BBD], since the function f 7‚Üí L(f ), where L(f ) is the sum of Lyapunov exponents
of f with respect to its maximal entropy measure, is constant equal to k
2 log d, hence pluriharmonic
on any such family of Latt`es maps.

In Section 5, we come back to symmetric products and apply Theorem 7 to symmetric product
Latt`es maps. We give a precise description of maximal families of Latt`es maps on Pk containing
the k-symmetric products of a rational map. More precisely, we prove the following consequence
of Theorem 7.
Theorem 8. Let k ‚â• 2 be an integer and let d ‚â• 2 be an integer. Let F ‚àà Homd(Pk) be the
k-symmetric product of f ‚àà Homd(P1). Then

(1) f is rigid if and only if F is rigid,
(2) otherwise, F belongs to a family of Latt`es maps which has dimension k(k + 1)/2 in moduli.

In particular, F can be approximated by Latt`es maps which are not symmetric products.

We give a more precise result in dimension 2, relying on the work of Rong [R]. A few words
are in order to describe this result. Rong‚Äôs result says that (up to taking an appropriate iterate)
Latt`es maps on P2 are either symmetric product or preserve an algebraic web associated with a
cubic curve (see 5 for more details).
In turn, our Theorem 8 says that any symmetric product
Latt`es map is either rigid, or contained in a family of Latt`es maps of dimension 3 in moduli which
symmetric product locus is a strict subfamily of dimension 1 in moduli.

Finally, we give examples of rigid Latt`es maps of P2 and P3. We also provide an example of
a non-rigid family of Latt`es maps of P2. All three examples rely on Milnor‚Äôs famous examples of
Latt`es rational maps of degree 2 and 4 (see [Mi]).

1. Dynamics of symmetric products

This section is devoted to a description of the dynamics of symmetric products. Some of the
statements of the present section are known and classical, but many of the arithmetic properties
are not in the literature.

Let Œ∑k : (P1)k ‚àí‚Üí Pk be the holomorphic map deÔ¨Åned as the quotient map of the action of
symmetric group Sk on (P1)k by permutting the terms of the product.
In fact, one can write
Œ∑k = [Œ∑k,0 : ¬∑¬∑¬∑ : Œ∑k,k] where Œ∑k,j is the homogeneous degree k symmetric function given by the
elementary homogeneous symmetric polynomials

Œ∑k,j([z1 : t1], . . . , [zk : tk]) := XI‚àà{0,1}k

We collect some basic properties of Œ∑k in the following proposition.

Proposition 1.1. Let Œ∑k : (P1)k ‚àí‚Üí Pk be the k-th symmetric product map.

(1) The map Œ∑k is a Ô¨Ånite branched cover of algebraic degree k and topological degree k!.
(2) For any number Ô¨Åeld K, the map Œ∑k : Md(P1)(K) ‚Üí Md(Pk)(K) is an embedding.

Proof.

(1) see e.g. [Ma] for more details about symmetric products.
(2) We need to show that a conjugate of f goes to a conjugate of F = Œ∑k(f ). Let Œ± ‚àà PGL(2).
We denote the conjugate as f Œ± = Œ± ‚ó¶ f ‚ó¶ Œ±‚àí1. Choose k + 2 points {Pi} in P1(K) so that
no k + 1 of {Œ∑k(Pi)} are co-hyperplanar and no k + 1 of {Œ∑k(f Œ±)(Pi)} are co-hyperplanar.
Since these are both closed conditions, we can Ô¨Ånd such points. DeÔ¨Åne Œ≤ ‚àà PGL(k + 2) as
the map that sends {Pi} to {Œ∑k(f Œ±)(Pi)}. Then by construction we have

Œ∑k ‚ó¶ f Œ± = F Œ≤ ‚ó¶ Œ∑k.

To show injectivity, assume there are two distinct f, g such that Œ∑k(f ) = Œ∑k(g). Since
the maps are distinct, there must be some point P ‚àà P1 such that f (P ) 6= g(P ) but that
Œ∑k(f )(Œ∑k(P )) = Œ∑k(g)(Œ∑k(P )). This is a contradiction, since the diagram commutes we must
have Œ∑k(f )(Œ∑k(P )) = Œ∑k(f (P )) 6= Œ∑k(g(P )) = Œ∑k(g)(Œ∑k(P )).

(cid:3)

One can actually show that the k-symmetric product of f is holomorphic and enjoys good

dynamical properties with respect to the ones of f .
Proposition 1.2. For any f ‚àà Homd(P1), the k-symmetric product F of f is well-deÔ¨Åned. More-
over, it satisÔ¨Åes the following properties.

(1) F is an endomorphism of algebraic degree d of Pk.
(2) If f is a degree d polynomial mapping of P1, then F is a degree d polynomial mapping of

Pk, i.e., there is a totally invariant hyperplane.

(3) If K is the Ô¨Åeld of deÔ¨Ånition of f , then F is also deÔ¨Åned over K.
(4) If K is the Ô¨Åeld of moduli of the equivalence class [f ] ‚àà Md(P1), then K is the Ô¨Åeld of

moduli of the equivalence class [F ] ‚àà Md(Pk).

Proof.

(1) Since f can be written f ([z : w]) = [P (z, w) : Q(z : w)] in homogeneous coordinates with
P, Q homogeneous polynomials, the map Œ∑k ‚ó¶ (f, . . . , f ) : (P1)k ‚Üí Pk is invariant under
the diagonal action of Sk. In particular, there exists homogeneous degree d polynomials
P0, . . . , Pk such that

and the map F exists as a rational mapping of Pk. Now, remark that

Œ∑k ‚ó¶ (f, . . . , f ) = [P0 : ¬∑¬∑¬∑ : Pk] ‚ó¶ Œ∑k
k\j=0
{Œ∑k,j ‚ó¶ (f, . . . , f ) = 0} = ‚àÖ

by construction and if x ‚àà Pk is an indeterminacy point of F , it means that Œ∑‚àí1
k {x} ‚àà
{Œ∑k,j ‚ó¶ (f, . . . , f ) = 0} for any 0 ‚â§ j ‚â§ k, which is impossible. In particular, the map F has
no indeterminacy points.
(2) If f is a degree d polynomial, one can write f ([z : t]) = [P (z, t) : td], where P is homogeneous

of degree d. One then can write Œ∑k ‚ó¶ (f, . . . , f )([z1 : t1], . . . , [zk : tk]) as follows:

Since Œ∑k,k([z1 : t1], . . . , [zk : tk]) = Qj tj, this gives Pk(x0 : ¬∑¬∑¬∑ : xk) = xd
k. Hence, the map
F can be written in homogeneous coordinates F ([x0 : ¬∑¬∑¬∑ : xk]) = [P0(x0, . . . , xk) : ¬∑¬∑¬∑ :
k]. Hence F ‚àí1{xk = 0} ‚äÇ {xk = 0}, i.e., the map F is a polynomial
Pk‚àí1(x0, . . . , xk) : xd
endomorphism of Pk.

(3) This statement is obvious since the map Œ∑k is deÔ¨Åned over Q.
(4) We deÔ¨Åne the Ô¨Åeld of moduli of g ‚àà Homd(Pk) is the smallest Ô¨Åeld K such that [g] ‚àà

Md(Pk)(K). Equivalently, the Ô¨Åeld of moduli is the Ô¨Åxed Ô¨Åeld of the set
G([g]) = {œÑ ‚àà Gal(Q/Q) : gœÑ = gŒ± for some Œ± ‚àà PGL(k + 1, Q)}.

Since we know from Proposition 1.1 that Œ∑k is an embedding of the moduli space for each
element of G([f ]), there is a corresponding element in G([F ]) and the Ô¨Åelds of moduli must
be the same.

(cid:3)

Let F ‚àà Homd(Pk) be deÔ¨Åned over the Ô¨Åeld of complex numbers. Let ¬µF be the maximal entropy
measure of F : Pk ‚Üí Pk. Let also œÄj : (P1)k ‚Üí P1 be the projection onto the i-th coordinate. Recall
that the sum of Lyapunov exponents of F wih respect to ¬µF is the real number

L(F ) :=ZPk

log |DF|¬µF ,

where |¬∑| denotes any hermitian metric on Pk. One of the many consequences of the work of Briend
and Duval [BD2] is that that for any F ‚àà Homd(Pk), we have L(F ) ‚â• k log ‚àöd.

An easy result is the following. We include a proof for the sake of completeness.

Lemma 1.3. Let F ‚àà Homd(Pk) be the k-symmetric product of f ‚àà Homd(P1). Then

Proof. Let Àúf := (f, . . . , f ). First, one easily sees that the probability measure

L(F ) = k ¬∑ L(f ) .

ŒΩf,k :=

k^j=1

(œÄj)‚àó¬µf

is Àúf -invariant and has constant jacobian dk. As a consequence, (Œ∑k)‚àó(ŒΩf,k) is invariant and has
constant jacobian dk. Since the only probability measure having these properties of the maximal
entropy measure of F , we get

Hence

¬µF = (Œ∑k)‚àó(ŒΩf,k) .

L(F ) = ZPk

By construction of F , the chain rule gives

As ŒΩf,k is the intersection of closed positive (1, 1)-currents with continuous potentials on (P1)k, it
does not give mass to pluripolar sets. In particular, one has log | det DŒ∑k| ‚àà L1(ŒΩf,k) and

which ends the proof.

2. Preperiodic points and canonical heights via symmetric products

In this section we modify slightly Œ∑k.

Instead of taking the symmetric product of k copies
(f, . . . , f ) or (P, . . . , P ), we work over a Galois Ô¨Åeld and take the symmetric product of the k-Galois
conjugates. To preserve the embedding Md(P1) ‚Üí Md(Pk) proven in Proposition 1.1, we need f to
be deÔ¨Åned over the ground Ô¨Åeld. This is because the elementary multi-symmetric polynomials have
relations among them and if we need to consider Œ∑k applied where both the coeÔ¨Écients of the map
and the point have non-trivial conjugates, the resulting F must use multi-symmetric polynomials
and is not a morphism. To avoid confusion, we specify this as ÀúŒ∑k(P ) = Œ∑k(P1, . . . , Pk) where Pi
are the Galois conjugates of P . Note that requiring Galois Ô¨Åelds is not overly restrictive as we can
always extend to the Galois closure.

Remark. Note that ÀúŒ∑k is a cover of topological degree k which sends the k Galois conjugates to a
single point as opposed to Œ∑k which is a cover of topological degree k!.
Lemma 2.1. Let L be an extension of the number Ô¨Åeld K. Let S ‚äÇ L be the set of primes of
bad reduction for f : P1(L) ‚Üí P1(L) with f deÔ¨Åned over K. Then the primes of bad reduction for
F = ÀúŒ∑k(f ) is the set {p ‚à© K : p ‚àà S}.
Proof. Assume that p is a prime of bad reduction of f . Then (modulo p) there is a point P = (x, y)
such that f (x, y) = (0, 0) with not both x, y = 0. So, we also have

F ( ÀúŒ∑k(P )) ‚â° (0, . . . , 0)

(mod pOL ‚à© K).

Since one of x, y 6= 0, we have at least one coordinate of ÀúŒ∑k(P ) 6= 0 and, thus, F has bad reduction.

Now assume that F has bad reduction at a prime p ‚àà K. Then there is a point

P = (Œ≤0, . . . , Œ≤N )

8

such that F (P ) = (0, . . . , 0) with not all Œ≤i = 0. Thus, the polynomial deÔ¨Åning the Galois conjugates
Œ≤i is not identically 0:

NYi=1
(yiX ‚àí xiY ) = Œ≤0X N ‚àí Œ≤1X N‚àí1Y + ¬∑¬∑¬∑ + (‚àí1)N Œ≤N Y N .

So there is at least one non-identically zero pair (xi, yi) for which f (xi, yi) = (0, 0). Thus, f has
bad reduction at a prime of L dividing p.
(cid:3)
Proposition 2.2. Let L be a Galois Ô¨Åeld of degree k over K and let f : P1 ‚Üí P1 be deÔ¨Åned over K.
The rational preperiodic points of F = Œ∑k(f ) come from Œ∑k(P1, . . . , Pk), where Pi are preperiodic
points for f . Furthermore, if each Pi is periodic of exact period ni, then Œ∑k(P1, . . . , Pk) ‚àà Pk is
periodic of exact period dividing lcm(ni) for F .
Proof. Since Œ∑k ‚ó¶ f n = F n ‚ó¶ Œ∑k, it is clear that preperiodic points go to preperiodic points and that
periodic points of exact period n for f are periodic points of exact period dividing n.

(cid:3)

Note that this allows one to Ô¨Ånd all the rational periodic points deÔ¨Åned over a Galois Ô¨Åeld L
with [L : K] = k for a map f : P1 ‚Üí P1 deÔ¨Åned over K. In particular, this method searches over
all possible degree k extensions simultaneously.

We Ô¨Ånd the Q rational preperiodic points of F and construct the corresponding number Ô¨Åeld
preperiodic points for f . Every preperiodic point deÔ¨Åned over any number Ô¨Åeld of degree 3 is among
these points. We Ô¨Ånd that over Q(Œ±) where the minimal polynomial of Œ± is 64x3 + 16x2‚àí 164x + 23,
there are 21 K-rational preperiodic points for f .
Over Q it is conjectured that there are at most 9 rational preperiodic points [P], and for quadratic

Ô¨Åelds it is conjectured there are at most 15 rational preperiodic points [DFK, HI].
Example 2. Consider fc : P1 ‚Üí P1 a quadratic polynomial deÔ¨Åned by f (x, y) = (x2 + cy2, y2).
For c ‚àà {‚àí2,‚àí16/9,‚àí64/9} there is a rational 5-cycle deÔ¨Åned over a degree 5 number Ô¨Åeld. The
authors are not aware of any examples of 5-cycles for lower degree Ô¨Åelds.
Proposition 2.3. Let f : P1 ‚Üí P1 be deÔ¨Åned over K with periodic points P1, . . . , Pk. We determine
the characteristic polynomial of the multiplier matrices of Œ∑k(f ) for Œ∑k(P1, . . . , Pk). We will denote
the multiplier matrix for f at P as dfP .

(1) If a point with multiplier Œª occurs m-times in (P1, . . . , Pk), then the characteristic polyno-

mial of dFŒ∑k(P1,...,Pk) will contain

(x ‚àí Œª)(x ‚àí Œª2)¬∑¬∑¬∑ (x ‚àí Œªm).

9

(2) If Œ∑k(P1, . . . , Pk) causes a mt-cycle to collapse to a t-cycle (this can occur when say the

whole cycle is contained in {P1, . . . , Pk}), then the characteristic polynomial will contain

(xm ‚àí Œª).

Proof. We Ô¨Årst reduce to the case where the points in {P1, . . . , Pk} all have the same multiplier.
Let P = (P1, . . . , Pm, Pm+1, . . . , Pk) where the Pi for 1 ‚â§ i ‚â§ m all have the same multiplier.
Then we change coordinates so that the collection of points becomes

P = (P1, . . . , Pm, (0 : 1), . . . , (0 : 1)) .

The multiplier is a local object, so we can just consider f near P and F = Œ∑k(f ) near Œ∑k(P ).
Denote ÀúF the restriction to the Ô¨Årst m coordinates of F . With P we have (Œ∑k,1, . . . , Œ∑k,k)(P ) =
(Œ∑k,1, . . . , Œ∑k,m, 0, . . . , 0). So the upper left k √ó k block of the multiplier matrix of F is the same as
the multiplier of ÀúF . Since we can always rearrange coordinates, we are restricted to the case where
all the multipliers are the same.

Now assume P = (P1, . . . , Pm) all have the same multiplier Œª (and are Ô¨Åxed by f ). We can

change coordinates so that locally we have

f = [Œªx1 + O(x2

1),¬∑¬∑¬∑ , Œªxm + O(x2

m)].

Note that locally the Œ∑m,i are the elementary symmetric polynomials œÉi. If we evaluate the œÉi at
f , it is clear that the leading terms are

Œ∑k(f ) = [ŒªœÉ1 + O(œÉ2

1), Œª2œÉ2 + O(œÉ2

2), . . . , ŒªmœÉm + O(œÉ2

m)].

Now assume P = (P1, . . . , Pm, . . . , Pk) where P1, . . . , Pm form an m-cycle with multiplier Œª for
f . In particular, Œ∑k collapses this m-cycle to a Ô¨Åxed point. Then we use the simple fact that if we
write f as a local power series

f (x) = Œªx + O(x2)

then

So that (f m)‚Ä≤(P1) = ¬∑¬∑¬∑ = (f m)‚Ä≤(Pm) = Qm
non-constant, we must have f‚Ä≤(Pi) 6= f‚Ä≤(Pj) for i 6= j, so that Qm

f m(x) = Œªmx + O(x2).

i=1 f‚Ä≤(Pi) = Œª. Since the Pi are distinct and f‚Ä≤ is

i=1(x ‚àí f‚Ä≤(Pi)) = xm ‚àí Œª.

(cid:3)

We can now prove Theorem 2 about the boundedness of rational preperiodic points over an

extension of the base Ô¨Åeld.
Proof of Theorem 2. We consider F = ÀúŒ∑k(f ) ‚àà Homd(Pk) deÔ¨Åned over K. Additionally, any prepe-
riodic point P deÔ¨Åned over a Galois extension L/K of degree at most k gets sent by ÀúŒ∑k to a
preperiodic point deÔ¨Åned over K.

(1) We Ô¨Årst prove the bound on the length of a rational periodic cycle.

We know from [H1] that the minimal period of ÀúŒ∑k(P ) is decomposed as

n = mrpe

where m is the period modulo p for ÀúŒ∑k(P ) by F , r is the multiplicative order of the multiplier
of ÀúŒ∑k(P ) by F , p = p ‚à© Q, and e is explicitly bounded as
1 + logŒ±(cid:18)‚àö5v(2)+‚àö5(v(2))2 +4

We have

kXi=0

(N p)i

m ‚â§
r ‚â§ k ¬∑ N (p).

The bound on m is simply the number of points modulo p in Pk. The bound on r is more
subtle. From Proposition 2.3 we have a relation between the multipliers of P and ÀúŒ∑k(P ).
The multiplicative order of the multiplier of P is either the same as the multiplicative order
of the multiplier of ÀúŒ∑k(P ) or the cycle collapses and the order increases. Since the cycle can
at most collapse by a factor of k, we have the given maximal possible multiplicative order
of the multiplier of ÀúŒ∑k(P ).

(2) We now prove the bound on the total number of preperiodic points. We are constructing
a bound Cf (k, K) on the number of L-rational preperiodic points where L is a Galois
extension of K of degree at most k. If CF (K) is a bound on the number of preperiodic
points for F over K, then since ÀúŒ∑K is a cover of degree k

Cf (k, K) ‚â§ k ¬∑ CF (K).

2.1. Canonical heights. To apply this construction to computing canonical heights over number
Ô¨Åelds, we need to determine the relation between ÀÜhf (P ) and ÀÜhF ( ÀúŒ∑k(P )). We know that deg(f ) =
deg(F ) and that ÀúŒ∑k(f n(P )) = F n( ÀúŒ∑k(P )). So all we need to determine is the relation between the
heights

H(P )

and H( ÀúŒ∑k(P )).

There is a standard relation between the height of the coeÔ¨Écients of a polynomial and the height
of its roots

We address the practical problem of computing the ÀÜhf (œÉ(Œ±i)) by computing the local Green‚Äôs
functions with the ‚ÄúÔ¨Çip-trick‚Äù as in [S1, Exercise 5.29]. Recall that we only need to compute the
Green‚Äôs functions for the primes of bad reduction, and the primes of bad reduction for f and F are
the same (Lemma 2.1).

3. Postcritically finite symmetric products

In this section, we prove Theorem 4. The proof of this result relies on the following description

of the critical set of F in terms of critical sets of f and Œ∑k.

Lemma 3.1. The critical set of F is given by

C(F ) = Œ∑kÔ£´
k‚àí1[s=0
(P1)s √ó C(f ) √ó (P1)k‚àís‚àí1 ‚à™ [1‚â§i<j‚â§k
Ô£≠
where ‚àÜi,j = {x ‚àà (P1)k ; xi = xj}.
Proof. First, note that the critical locus of F is the projection by Œ∑k of the critical locus of the
map (f, . . . , f ) acting on (P1)k and of the critical locus of Œ∑k. We, thus, just have to determine the
critical locus of (f, . . . , f ) and of Œ∑k. The critical locus of (f, . . . , f ) obviously is

‚àÜi,jÔ£∂
Ô£∏

k‚àí1[s=0
(P1)s √ó C(f ) √ó (P1)k‚àís‚àí1,

and the critical locus of Œ∑k is the set where the action of the group Sk is not simply transitive, i.e.
(x1, . . . , xk) ‚àà (P1)k is in the critical set of Œ∑1
(cid:3)

k if and only if xi = xj for some 1 ‚â§ i < j ‚â§ k.

12

Proof of Theorem 4. Let us Ô¨Årst prove that F is postcritically Ô¨Ånite if and only if f is postcritically
Ô¨Ånite. Remark that the postcritical set of F is an algebraic variety if and only if it is the image
under Œ∑k of an algebraic variety. According to Lemma 3.1, one, thus, sees that F is postcritically
Ô¨Ånite if and only if the union of the iterates under the map (f, . . . , f ) (resp. (f, f )) of the set

(resp. ‚àÜ ‚äÇ (P1)2), which is

k‚àí1[s=0
(P1)s √ó C(f ) √ó (P1)k‚àís‚àí1 ‚äÇ (P1)k

k‚àí1[s=0
(P1)s √ó P(f ) √ó (P1)k‚àís‚àí1 ‚äÇ (P1)k

(resp. the diagonal ‚àÜ of (P1)2) is an algebraic variety of (P1)k (resp. (P1)2). Hence, F is post-
critically Ô¨Ånite if and only if f is. Let us now prove that F is strongly postcritically Ô¨Ånite if an
only if f is postcritically Ô¨Ånite. By Lemma 3.1, the problem reduces to proving that (f, . . . , f ) is

strongly postcritically Ô¨Ånite as a self-map of (P1)k and as a self-map of Si<j ‚àÜi,j if and only if f is
postcritically Ô¨Ånite. Let us proceed by induction on k ‚â• 2. For k = 2, by Lemma 3.1, the critical
set of (f, f ) is P1 √ó C(f ) ‚à™ C(f ) √ó P1 and the critical set of its restriction to P1 √ó C(f ) ‚à™ C(f ) √ó P1
is C(f ) √ó C(f ). Moreover, the critical locus of the restriction of (f, f ) to ‚àÜ is also C(f ) √ó C(f ).
Moreover, f is postcritically Ô¨Ånite if and only if the restriction of (f, f ) to P1√óC(f )‚à™C(f )√ó P1‚à™ ‚àÜ
is strongly postcritically Ô¨Ånite, which concludes the proof for k = 2.
Assume now that for all 2 ‚â§ s < k, the s-symmetric product of f is strongly postcritically Ô¨Ånite
if and only if f is. According to Lemma 3.1 and to the above discussion, it is suÔ¨Écient to prove
that (f, . . . , f ) restricted to

k‚àí1[s=0
(P1)s √ó C(f ) √ó (P1)k‚àís‚àí1 ‚à™ [1‚â§i<j‚â§k

‚àÜi,j

is strongly postcritically Ô¨Ånite if and only if f is postcritically Ô¨Ånite. By induction assumption,
the strong postcritical Ô¨Åniteness of (f . . . , f ) on (P1)s √ó C(f ) √ó (P1)k‚àís‚àí1 is equivalent to that of
f . Finally, there exists a map œÉi,j : (P1)k ‚Üí (P1)k permuting coordinates such that œÉi,j(‚àÜi,j) =
‚àÜ √ó (P1)k‚àí2, and the following diagram commutes

‚àÜi,j

œÉi,j

(f,...,f )

‚àÜi,j

œÉi,j

‚àÜ √ó (P1)k‚àí2

(f,...,f )

/ ‚àÜ √ó (P1)k‚àí2

In particular, the problem reduces to the case of the (k ‚àí 2)-symmetric product of f and the
induction assumption allows us to conclude.

(cid:3)

We now want to give a negative answer to the question in the case when indeterminacy points
are allowed. To do so, we provide an example based on a map from [KPR] of a degree 4 rational
mapping of P2 having the wanted properties. For any a ‚àà C \ {0}, we let

Fa : [x : y : z] ‚àà P2
This provides a good counter-example.

Proposition 3.2. The following holds:

a is rational (i.e. I(F 2

(2) For all but countably many a ‚àà C \ {0}, the map F 2

a is not strongly postcritically Ô¨Ånite.

an indeterminacy point of F 2

a is rational. Moreover, the critical locus of Fa is

a , hence F 2
C(Fa) = {x = 0} ‚à™ {y = 0} ‚à™ {z = x} .

But Fa({y = 0}) = {x = 0}, Fa({y = 0}) ‚äÇ {x = 0}, and Fa({x = z}) = {[1 : 0 : 0]} and we get

Hence, Fa is postcritically Ô¨Ånite, as is F 2
not strongly postcritically Ô¨Ånite, we look at the restriction

[z : t] ‚àà P1. Its critical points are [0 : 1] and [1 : 1]. Moreover, fa([0 : 1]) = [0 : 1], hence, fa is a
quadratic polynomial. It is conjugate to the map

pa : z ‚àà C 7‚Üí z2 ‚àí

In particular, fa is postcritically Ô¨Ånite if and only if pa is postciritcally Ô¨Ånite, i.e.

4. Families of Latt`es maps in dimension at least 2

Our proof decomposes in two steps. First, we prove that the induced analytic family of complex
dimension k tori up to biholomorphism has the same dimension as the family of Latt`es maps. We
then follow Milnor‚Äôs proof for the case k = 1 and adapt his argument.

4.1. Families of abelian varieties. This paragraph is devoted to recalling classical results con-
cerning abelian varieties. For the material of this paragraph, we refer to [De].
The moduli space of polarized abelian varieties.

A polarization on a complex abelian variety T is an entire K¬®ahler form œâ on T . To (T , œâ) can
be associated integers d1|¬∑¬∑¬∑ |dk and a matrix œÑ ‚àà Mk(C) with œÑ t = œÑ and Im(œÑ ) > 0 such that
T = Ck/ŒìœÑ , with ŒìœÑ := œÑ Zk ‚äï ‚àÜZk and ‚àÜ = diag(d1, . . . , dk) ‚àà Mk(Z). We say T is of type ‚àÜ.

We now give the classical deÔ¨Ånition of the moduli space of type ‚àÜ abelian varieties. Let

For any Ô¨Åeld K, let Sp2k(K) be the symplectic group

Hk := {œÑ ‚àà Mk(C) ; œÑ t = œÑ , Im(œÑ ) > 0}.

Ik

Sp2k(K) := {M ‚àà GL2k(K) ; M JM t = J} ,

œÉ‚àÜ(M ) :=(cid:18) Ik

0 ‚àÜ (cid:19) , M ‚àà GL2k(Q).

M(cid:18) Ik

where J =(cid:18) 0

0 ‚àÜ (cid:19)‚àí1
Finally, we let G‚àÜ := œÉ‚àÜ(M2k(Z)) ‚à© Sp2k(Q).

The well-deÔ¨Åned map

M =(cid:18)(cid:18) A B

C D (cid:19) , œÑ(cid:19) 7‚àí‚Üí M ¬∑ œÑ := (AœÑ + B)(CœÑ + D)‚àí1

deÔ¨Ånes an action of the group Sp2k(R) on Hk. Moreover, any discrete subgroup of Sp2k(R) acts
properly discontinuously on Hk. The main result we rely on is that two polarized abelian varieties
Ck/ŒìœÑ and Ck/ŒìŒ≥ of type ‚àÜ are isomorphic if and only if there exists M ‚àà G‚àÜ with M ¬∑ œÑ = Œ≥.
DeÔ¨Ånition 4.1. The moduli space Ak,‚àÜ of polarized abelian variety of type ‚àÜ is the set of isomor-
phism classes of such varieties. Equivalently, this is Hk/G‚àÜ.

It is known that the moduli space Ak,‚àÜ is a quasi-projective variety and that it has dimension
k(k + 1)/2.
Dimension in moduli of families of abelian varieties. We say that (Tt)t‚ààX is a holomorphic family
of abelian varieties if there exists a complex manifold bT and a holomorphic map p : bT ‚àí‚Üí X, such
that p‚àí1{t} = Tt for all t ‚àà X.
We want to deÔ¨Åne properly a notion of dimension in moduli for the family (Tt)t‚ààX . First, notice
that the polarization of Tt is deÔ¨Åned by an entire K¬®ahler form. As seen in the proof of [De,
Proposition VI.1.3], when t varies in X, the integers d1|¬∑¬∑¬∑ |dk cannot change. In particular, the
type of the polarization is constant in the family (Tt)t‚ààX and there exists a holomorphic map
t ‚àà X 7‚àí‚Üí œÑ (t) ‚àà Hk with Tt = Ck/(œÑ (t)Zk ‚äï ‚àÜZk) for all t ‚àà Hk.
As a consequence, we can deÔ¨Åne the type of a holomorphic family (Tt)t‚ààX of abelian varieties as
the type Tt0 of any t0 ‚àà X.
DeÔ¨Ånition 4.2. We say that a holomorphic family (Tt)t‚ààX of abelian varieties of type ‚àÜ has
dimension q in moduli if the analytic set Œ†‚àÜ(Œõ) ‚äÇ Ak,‚àÜ has dimension q.
4.2. Latt`es maps and abelian varieties.
Families of Latt`es maps. Recall that F ‚àà Homd(Pk) is a Latt`es map if there exists a complex k-
dimensional abelian variety T , an aÔ¨Éne map I : T ‚Üí T , and a Galois branched cover Œò : T ‚Üí Pk
making the following diagram commute

[Du]). These maps are known to be postcritically Ô¨Ånite (see e.g.

[BD1]). Another way
(see e.g.
to present Latt`es maps, given by Berteloot and Loeb [BL2, Th¬¥eor`eme 1.1 & Proposition 4.1], is
the following (see also [BD1]): A complex crystallographic group G is a discrete group of aÔ¨Éne
transformations of a complex aÔ¨Éne space V such that the quotient X = V /G is compact.

A degree d endomorphism F : Pk ‚àí‚Üí Pk is a Latt`es map if there exists a ramiÔ¨Åed cover
œÉ : Ck ‚àí‚Üí Pk, an aÔ¨Éne map A : Ck ‚àí‚Üí Ck whose linear part is ‚àöd ¬∑ U where U ‚àà U(k) is

Lemma 4.3. Let (ft)t‚ààX be any holomorphic family of Latt`es maps of Pk. Then there exists a
holomorphic family of complex crystallographic groups (Gt)t‚ààX , a holomorphic family of branched
covers (œÉt)t‚ààX , and a holomorphic family of aÔ¨Éne maps (At)t‚ààX , as above. Moreover, the linear
part of At is independent of t.
Proof. Let (ft)t‚ààX be a holomorphic family of Latt`es maps and let Gt, At and œÉt be such that
œÉt ‚ó¶ At = ft ‚ó¶ œÉt on Ck. It is obvious that Gt, At and œÉt depend holomorphically on t. Moreover,
the linear part of At can be written ‚àöd ¬∑ Ut with Ut ‚àà U(k) ‚äÇ GLk(C) and the map t 7‚Üí Ut is
holomorphic. Hence, it has to be constant.

Equality of the dimensions in moduli. We now may prove the following key fact.
Proposition 4.4. Let (fŒª)Œª‚ààŒõ be a holomorphic family of degree d Latt`es maps of Pk, and let
(TŒª)Œª‚ààŒõ be any induced family of abelian varieties. Then the family (fŒª)Œª‚ààŒõ has dimension q in
moduli if and only if (TŒª)Œª‚ààŒõ has dimension q in moduli.
Proof. Pick any induced holomorphic family of tori (Tt)t‚ààŒõ. Let q and r stand, respectively, for
the dimension in moduli of (ft)t‚ààŒõ and (Tt)t‚ààŒõ. Assume Ô¨Årst that r > q. Choose t0 ‚àà Œõ. By
assumption, there exists a holomorphic disk D ‚äÇ Œõ centered at t0 and such that (Tt)t‚ààD has
dimension 1 in moduli and the canonical projection Œ† : D 7‚àí‚Üí Md(Pk) is constant. In particular,
there exists a holomorphic disk (œÜt)t‚ààD of P SL(k + 1, C) such that ft = œÜ‚àí1
t ‚ó¶ ft0 ‚ó¶ œÜt on Pk. Since
(Tt)t is an induced family of abelian varieties, we have
Tt

ft0

As a consequence, œÜt ‚ó¶ Œòt : Tt ‚Üí Pk and Œòt0 : Tt0 ‚Üí Pk are isomorphic Galois branched cover.
Hence, there exists an analytic isomorphism œàt : Tt ‚Üí Tt0 for any t ‚àà D. Hence, Tt is isomorphic
to Tt0 for any t ‚àà D. This implies that (Tt)t‚ààD is trivial in moduli. This is a contradiction.

For the converse inequality, we also proceed by contradiction. Assume r < q. Since Md(Pk) is a
geometric quotient, for any t0 ‚àà Œõ, there exists a local dimension q complex submanifold X0 ‚äÇ Œõ
containing t0 and such that the canonical projection Œ† : X0 7‚àí‚Üí Md(Pk) has discrete Ô¨Åbers over
its image.
As above, this implies the existence of a holomorphic disk D ‚äÇ X0 centered at t0 and such that
the corresponding family (Tt)t‚ààD is trivial in moduli, i.e. Tt ‚âÉ Tt0 as abelian varieties for any t ‚àà D.
We, thus, may assume that T := Tt0 = Tt for all t ‚àà D. We, thus, have a holomorphic family
(Dt)‚ààD of degree ‚àöd isogenies of T and a holomorphic family of Galois covers Œòt : T ‚àí‚Üí Pk with

T

ft

Let Œì be a lattice deÔ¨Åning T , i.e. such that T = Ck/Œì. Lifting Dt to an aÔ¨Éne map ÀúDt : Ck ‚àí‚Üí Ck,
we end up with a holomorphic map t ‚àà D 7‚àí‚Üí ÀúDt ‚àà AÔ¨Ä(Ck), which satisÔ¨Åes ÀúDt(Œì) ‚äÇ Œì and
ÀúDt = ‚àöd ¬∑ Ut + œÑt with Ut ‚àà Uk and œÑt ‚àà 1
2 Œì. As a consequence, the map t 7‚Üí ÀúDt is discrete, hence
constant. The family (Dt)t‚ààD is thus constant. Let D := Dt for all t.

Finally, by assumption, there exists an isomorphism Œ±t : Tt ‚Üí Tt0 for all t ‚àà D, which depends
analytically on t. Hence Œòt = Œòt0 ‚ó¶ Œ±t for all t ‚àà D, and (Œòt)t‚ààD is a holomorphic family of Galois
cover of Pk which are isomorphic. As a consequence, there exists a holomorphic disk t ‚àà D 7‚àí‚Üí
œÜt ‚àà P SL(k + 1, C) such that Œòt = œÜt ‚ó¶ Œòt0, for all t ‚àà D. Hence, we get

œÜt ‚ó¶ (Œòt0 ‚ó¶ D) = (ft ‚ó¶ œÜt) ‚ó¶ Œòt0

which we may rewrite

ft0 ‚ó¶ Œòt0 = Œòt0 ‚ó¶ D =(cid:0)œÜ‚àí1

t ‚ó¶ ft ‚ó¶ œÜt(cid:1) ‚ó¶ Œòt0 .

This gives ft0 = œÜ‚àí1
discrete in X0.

t ‚ó¶ ft ‚ó¶ œÜt, i.e. D ‚äÇ Œ†‚àí1{ft0}. This is a contradiction since the Ô¨Åbers of Œ† are

(cid:3)

An immediate consequence is the following.

Corollary 4.5. Let (fŒª)Œª‚ààŒõ be a holomorphic family of degree d Latt`es maps of Pk. Then the
family (fŒª)Œª‚ààŒõ has dimension in moduli at most k(k + 1)/2.
4.3. ClassiÔ¨Åcation of maximal families of Latt`es maps. We now want to prove Theorem 7.
We use the description of Berteloot and Loeb of Latt`es maps [BL2]. When U ‚àà L(Ck), we denote
by EŒª := ker (ŒªIk ‚àí U ) the eigenspace associated with the eigenvalue Œª ‚àà C.

We may prove the following.

Theorem 4.6. Assume (ft)t‚ààX is a maximal family of Latt`es maps containing f and let D =
‚àöd ¬∑ U + Œ≥ be the aÔ¨Éne map inducing f . Let q¬± := dimC ker(U ¬± Ik); then

dimM(ft, X) = (q+ + q‚àí) ¬∑

q+ + q‚àí + 1

.

Remark. Let (ft)t‚ààX be any holomorphic family of Latt`es maps of Pk, let (At)t‚ààX be the holo-
morphic family of aÔ¨Éne maps given by Lemma 4.3, and write ‚àöd ¬∑ U the linear part of At with
U ‚àà U(k). Be aware that for any integer m ‚àà Z, since U is unitary, we have dimC Em(‚àöd ¬∑ U ) = 0
for all m 6= ¬±‚àöd and dimC Em(‚àöd ¬∑ U ) = 0 for all m if d is not the square on an integer.
Proof. Up to taking a connected subvariety of X, we may assume q := dim(ft) = dimM(ft).
According to Proposition 4.4, the induced family of abelian varieties (Tt)t‚ààX has also dimension q
in moduli.
Choose t0 ‚àà X. Notice that, by Lemma 4.3, if At : Tt ‚Üí Tt is the aÔ¨Éne map inducing ft, then
At for all t has linear part ‚àödU ‚àà U(k) independent of t. Our assumption implies that the isogeny

A = (At)t preserves a family of abelian varieties with dimension in moduli q. Set

We now may prove it implies q = q‚àó. We prove Ô¨Årst q ‚â• q‚àó. If q‚àó = 0, this is trivial. Otherwise, up

where ‚ãÜ is a (k ‚àí q‚àó)-square diagonal unitary matrix. Let Œì0 = œÑ0Zk + ‚àÜZk be a lattice preserved
by At0 with Tt0 ‚âÉ Ck/ŒìœÑ0 . Write

œÑ0 =(cid:18) œÑ1,1

œÑ t

œÑ1,2

œÑ2,2 (cid:19)

where œÑ1,1 ‚àà Hq‚àó, œÑ2,2 ‚àà Hk‚àíq‚àó and œÑ1,2 is a (q‚àó, k ‚àí q‚àó)-matrix. For Œª ‚àà Hq‚àó, we let

œÑ (Œª) :=(cid:18) Œª

œÑ t
1,2

œÑ1,2

œÑ2,2 (cid:19) ‚àà Hk.

Let TŒª := Ck/ŒìŒª. The family (TŒª) has dimension q‚àó in moduli. Remark also that

for some Œ± ‚àà C‚àó (resp. u, v ‚àà Œ± ¬∑ Zk) and that this property has to be preserved in any family of
Latt`es maps containing f . Hence, we may let

Œ≥ = œÑ0 ¬∑ u + ‚àÜ ¬∑ v ‚àà Œ± ¬∑ Œì0

Œ≥(Œª) := œÑ (Œª) ¬∑ u + ‚àÜ ¬∑ v ‚àà Œ± ¬∑ ŒìŒª , Œª ‚àà Œõ ,

so that the map Œ≥ : Œõ ‚Üí Ck is holomorphic and the map AŒª := ‚àöd ¬∑ U + Œ≥(Œª) induces an isogeny
of the abelian variety TŒª. Moreover, we have TœÑ1,1 ‚âÉ Tt0 and ft0 is induced by AœÑ0. Hence, ft0
belongs to a family of Latt`es maps which is parameterized by Œõ. By Proposition 4.4, this family
has dimension at least q‚àó in moduli, and q ‚â• q‚àó.

We now prove the converse inequality by contradiction, assuming q > q‚àó. Assume Ô¨Årst that
q‚àó = 0. Since q > 0, we again can Ô¨Ånd a holomorphic disk D ‚äÇ X with dim Œ†‚àÜ(D) = 1 where ‚àÜ is
the type of the family (Tt)t‚ààD. By assumption, U ‚àà U(k) is diagonal and has no integer eigenvalue.
Hence, U = diag(u1, . . . , uk) with |ui| = 1 and u2
i 6= 1. On the other hand, if œÉt : Ck ‚Üí Pk is the
Galois cover making the following diagram commute

ft

for any t ‚àà D, any z ‚àà Ck, and any a ‚àà Œìt, we Ô¨Ånd
This gives ‚àöd ¬∑ U (Œìt) ‚äÇ Œìt for all t. In particular, if (e1, . . . , ek) is the canonical basis of Ck

œÉt(‚àöd ¬∑ U (z) + Œ≥t) = ft(œÉt(z)) = ft(œÉt(z + a)) = œÉt(‚àöd ¬∑ U (z + a) + Œ≥t).

‚àöd ¬∑ (U ‚ó¶ œÑt) ¬∑ ei = œÑt ¬∑ u + ‚àÜ ¬∑ v

for some u, v ‚àà Zk, and œÑt is a non-constant holomorphic map of the parameter t by assumption.
Since ‚àöd ¬∑ U is diagonal, this gives
‚àöd ¬∑ ui

œÑt,i,juj + ‚àÜi,jvj .

œÑt,i,jŒ¥i,j =

kXj=1

kXj=1

This is impossible, since it gives that œÑt is constant on D hence that (Tt) is a trivial family.
Assume Ô¨Ånally that q‚àó > 0. As in the proof of Proposition 4.4, since Md(Pk) is a geometric
quotient, for any t0 ‚àà X there exists a local dimension q complex submanifold X0 ‚äÇ X containing
t0 and such that the canonical projection Œ† : X0 7‚àí‚Üí Md(Pk) has discrete Ô¨Åbers over its image.
Notice that for any t0 ‚àà X, there exists a polydisk Dq‚àó centered at t0 in X0, as described above.
By assumption, there exists a disk D centered at t0 which is transverse to Dq‚àó. As above, write
Œìt = œÑ (t)Zk ‚äï ‚àÜZk and decompose œÑ (t):

œÑ (t) :=(cid:18) œÑ1,1(t)

where œÑi,j(t) is holomorphic on t ‚àà D. Let Œì‚Ä≤t := œÑ2,2(t)Zk + ‚àÜ‚Ä≤Zk, where

‚àÜ‚Ä≤ = diag(dk‚àíq‚àó+1, . . . , dk)

and the di‚Äôs are given by ‚àÜ = diag(d1, . . . , dk) with di|di+1. Up to reducing D, we may assume Œì‚Ä≤t is
not G‚àÜ‚Ä≤-equivalent to Œì‚Ä≤t0 and that ‚àÜ‚Ä≤ is the type of the family (T ‚Ä≤t )t‚ààD of abelian varieties deÔ¨Åned as
T ‚Ä≤t := Ck‚àíq‚àó/Œì‚Ä≤t. We now let U‚Ä≤ = diag(uk‚àíq‚àó+1, . . . , uk) ‚àà U(k‚àí q‚àó) where, again, the ui‚Äôs are given
by U = diag(u1, . . . , uk). We Ô¨Ånally let Œ≥‚Ä≤t = (Œ≥t,k‚àíq‚àó+1, . . . , Œ≥t,k) ‚àà Ck‚àíq‚àó and A‚Ä≤t := ‚àöd ¬∑ U‚Ä≤ + Œ≥‚Ä≤t.
The family (T ‚Ä≤t , At)t induces a family of Latt`es maps on Pk‚àíq‚àó with dim(U‚Ä≤ ‚àì Ik‚àíq‚àó) = 0. We thus
have reduced to the case q‚àó = 0.

(cid:3)

An immediate corollary is

Corollary 4.7. The dimension in moduli of (ft)t‚ààX is non-zero if and only if d is the square of
an integer and the linear map U has at least one integer eigenvalue.

We now derive Theorem 7 from Theorem 4.6.

Proof of Theorem 7. If dimM(fŒª, Œõ) = 0, then by Theorem 4.6, 0 = q‚àöd + q
q
¬±

‚àí‚àöd. Since both
‚àöd ‚â• 0, we must have q‚àöd = q
On the other hand, suppose dimM(fŒª, Œõ) > 0. Again by Theorem 4.6, at least one of q‚àöd
‚àí‚àöd must be positive. Recall that U , the linear part of At, is unitary. Thus, we have
qm := dimC Em(‚àöd ¬∑ U ) = 0 for all m 6= ¬±‚àöd and qm = 0 for all m if d is not the square on an

and q

‚àöd = 0.

‚àí

integer. Since one or both of q

¬±‚àöd must be positive, the result follows.

(cid:3)

Among symmetric products, we can easily characterize Latt`es ones.

5. Symmetric product Latt`es maps

Proposition 5.1. Let k, d ‚â• 2 and let f ‚àà Homd(P1), and let F ‚àà Homd(Pk) be the k-symmetric
product of f . Then F is a Latt`es map if and only if f is a Latt`es map. Moreover, if T is an elliptic
curve, I : T ‚Üí T is aÔ¨Éne and Œò : T ‚Üí P1 is the Galois cover such that

Proof. Berteloot and Dupont [BD1] proved that F is Latt`es if and only L(F ) = k log ‚àöd. A
similar result was known by [Z] in dimension 1. Namely, f ‚àà homd(P1) is Latt`es if and only if
L(f ) = log ‚àöd. The fact that F is Latt`es if and only if f is Latt`es follows directly from Lemma 1.3.
Assume now that f is a Latt`es map induced by I : T ‚Üí T under the Galois cover Œò : T ‚Üí P1. By

which concludes the proof.

We now come to the proof of Theorem 8.

(cid:3)

Proof of Theorem 8. It is classical that f is rigid if and only if the linear part of the induced isogeny
A is not an integer (see [Mi]). We now let F be the k-symmetric product of f . We have the following
alternatives:

(1) either q‚àöd + q
(2) or q‚àöd = k (or q

‚àí‚àöd = 0,

‚àöd = k).

‚àí

We now just have to apply Theorem 7.

(cid:3)

In dimension 2. An algebraic web is given by a reduced curve C ‚äÇ (P2)‚ãÜ, where (P2)‚ãÜ is the dual
projective plane consisting of lines in P2. The web is invariant for a holomorphic map f on P2 if
every line in P2 belonging to C is mapped to another such line.

In [R, Theorems 4.2 & 4.4], Rong Feng gave the following description of Latt`es maps on P2: pick

a Latt`es map F ‚àà Homd(P2), then

Homd2(P1)),

‚Ä¢ either F or F 2 is the 2-symmetric product of a Latt`es map f ‚àà Homd(P1) (resp. f ‚àà
‚Ä¢ or F , F 2, F 3 or F 6 is a holomorphic map preserving an algebraic web associated to a

smooth cubic.

Combined with Theorem 8, this description directly gives the following result.
Corollary 5.2. Let F ‚àà Homd(P2) be a 2-symmetric product Latt`es map. Then

(1) either F is a rigid 2-symmetric product,
(2) or F is a 2-symmetric product which belongs to a family of Latt`es maps whic has dimension
3 in moduli. In that case, F can be approximated by Latt`es maps admitting a suitable iterate
which preserve an algebraic web associated to a smooth cubic. More precisely, any maximal
subfamily of symmetric products has dimension 1 in moduli.

Proof. According to Theorem 8, either F is rigid or F belongs to a family of Latt`es maps which
has dimension 3 in moduli. Now, if F belongs to such a family, there is a maximal subfamily (Ft)t
which consists in symmetric products which has dimension 1. The family (F m
t )t is also a maximal
family of symmetric products for all m ‚â• 1. The result follows from Rong‚Äôs classiÔ¨Åcation.
(cid:3)
Explicit examples. We now give exlicit examples.

Example 4 (Rigid Latt`es maps of P2 and P3). In [Mi], Milnor provided an example of degree 2
Latt`es map f ‚àà Rat2:

f : [z : t] 7‚Üí [z2 + a2zt : t2 + a2zt].

As deg(f ) is not the square of an integer, f has to be isolated in M2 (see e.g. [Mi]). The 2-symmetric
product of f is F : P2 ‚Üí P2 given by

[z : t : w] 7‚Üí [F1 : F2 : F3] ,

where F1(z, t, w) = z2 + a2zw + a4zt, F2(z, t, w) = z2 + a2tw + a4zt and F3(z, t, w) = w2 + a2zw +
a2tw + 2(a4 ‚àí 1)zt). We now turn to the 3-symmetric product of f .

The 3-symmetric product of f is G : P3 ‚Üí P3 given by

[z : t : w : u] 7‚Üí [G1 : G2 : G3 : G4] ,

where

G1(z, t, w, u) = z2 + a2uz + a4zw + a6zt,
G2(z, t, w, u) = t2 + a2wt + a4ut + a6zt,
G3(z, t, w, u) = w2 + a4zw + a2wt + 3a6zt + a2wu ‚àí 3a2zt ‚àí 2tu + 2a4ut,
G4(z, t, w, u) = u2 + 3a6zt + a2wu ‚àí 3a2zt ‚àí 2zw + a4zw + a4ut + a2uz

+a4zw.

By Theorem 7, since f is rigid, both maps F and G are rigid Latt`es maps, respectively, in the
moduli spaces M2(P2) and M2(P3).

where

[z : t : w] 7‚Üí [F1,Œª : F2,Œª : F3,Œª] ,

F3,Œª(z, t, w) = 4zw(z ‚àí t + w)(z ‚àí Œªt + Œª2w)

is a family of Ô¨Çexible Latt`es maps of P2. Moreover, it is a strict subfamily of a 2-dimensional family
of Ô¨Çexible Latt`es maps.
