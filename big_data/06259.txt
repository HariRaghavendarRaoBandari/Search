(Dated: March 22, 2016)

We show that the aging dynamics of a strong glass former displays a strikingly simple scaling be-
havior, connecting the average dynamics with its ﬂuctuations, namely the dynamical heterogeneities.
We perform molecular dynamics simulations of SiO2 with BKS interactions, quenching the system
from high to low temperature, and study the evolution of the system as a function of the waiting
time tw measured from the instant of the quench. We ﬁnd that both the aging behavior of the
dynamic susceptibility χ4 and the aging behavior of the probability distribution P (fs,r) of the local
incoherent intermediate scattering function fs,r can be described by simple scaling forms in terms of
the global incoherent intermediate scattering function C. The scaling forms are the same that have
been found to describe the aging of several fragile glass formers and that, in the case of P (fs,r),
have been also predicted theoretically. A thorough study of the length scales involved highlights the
importance of intermediate length scales. We also analyze directly the scaling dependence on parti-
cle type and on wavevector q, and ﬁnd that both the average and the ﬂuctuations of the slow aging
dynamics are controlled by a unique aging clock, which is not only independent of the wavevector
q, but is the same for O and Si atoms.

I.

INTRODUCTION

If a glass-forming liquid is cooled from a high tempera-
ture to a low temperature and crystallization is avoided,
the relaxation times of the system increase dramatically.
Depending on the experimental (or simulation) time ac-
cessible in comparison with this growing relaxation time,
either a supercooled liquid (in equilibrium) or a glass (out
of equilibrium) is observed [1–3]. In the non-equilibrium
(aging) case, after a temperature quench, the dynamics
at low temperature depends on the waiting time tw –
the time elapsed since the temperature quench. To in-
vestigate this rich dynamics a large variety of approaches
(experiments, computer simulations and theoretical tech-
niques) have been used and many diﬀerent systems have
been studied. Previous work on the dynamics both
of supercooled liquids and of glasses range from small
molecules, to polymers, to network glasses, to colloidal
glasses, and to granular systems (in the last two cases
density is the control parameter, instead of temperature).
For reviews we refer the reader to Refs.[1–5].

A common ﬁnding of these studies, and in that sense
a universal feature, is that the dynamics is spatially het-
erogeneous, meaning that there are fast and slow regions
in space [6–8]. One route for probing the extent of uni-
versality is to investigate the possible presence of similar
scaling behaviors of the dynamical heterogeneities in di-
verse systems. We take this route in the work presented
here. Speciﬁcally, we investigate the scaling of the dy-
namic susceptibility χ4, and of the distribution P (fs,r) of

∗ kvollmay@bucknell.edu

the local incoherent intermediate scattering function fs,r.
In previous work there have been relatively few studies
on P (fs,r) [9–14]. Also, most previous work on χ4 has
focused on the dependence of χ4 on the temperature (or
density) in the supercooled liquid regime (see §3.2.4.3 of
Ref.[6] and for SiO2 speciﬁcally see Refs.[15–18]) There
have been fewer studies for the aging dynamics, i.e. the
dependence of χ4 on the waiting time tw, which we dis-
cuss in this paper [13, 19–25].

Predictions for the scaling of P (fs,r) with respect to
tw follow from a theoretical framework for the aging dy-
namics that explains dynamical heterogeneities in terms
of the presence of Goldstone modes associated with a
broken continuous symmetry under time reparametriza-
tions [9–11, 26–32]. To study the dynamical heterogene-
ity, i.e. the local ﬂuctuations in the relaxation, we focus
on a local two-time correlation, the local incoherent in-
termediate scattering function fs,r(tw, tw + t), which de-
pends on the position r, the waiting time tw, and the time
interval t. The Goldstone modes correspond to space de-
pendent shifts of the time variable t → φr(t) such that

fs,r(tw, tw + t) ≈ C(φr(tw), φr(tw + t)).

(1)

Here C(tw, tw + t) corresponds to the global two-time
correlation function [9, 31]. More generally, a simple
Landau-theory approximation for the dynamical action
predicts that quantities describing ﬂuctuations in the sys-
tem depend on the waiting time tw and the time interval
t essentially only through the global two-time correlation
function C(tw, tw +t) [9–11]. Thus it is expected that the
probability distribution P (fs,r(tw, tw +t)) should collapse
for diﬀerent waiting times tw, for (tw, t) pairs chosen such
that C(tw, tw + t) is held ﬁxed. This prediction is consis-
tent with spin glass simulation results [9–11]. Despite the

theory being initially derived for spin glasses, simulation
results for structural glasses [12, 13, 20, 21, 25, 30, 31]
and experimental results for a polymer glass [22] ﬁnd this
predicted scaling to hold. The numerical simulations also
show that χ4(tw, tw + t) is a product of two factors: a
waiting-time dependent scale that grows with tw, and a
scaling function that depends on (tw, t) only through the
value of C(tw, tw + t).

The large variety of structural glass formers can be
divided into two broad groups, called fragile and strong
glass formers, due to their diﬀerent dependence of the
viscosity (and the relaxation time) on temperature [1–
3]. All of the previous tests of predictions of the Gold-
stone mode approach in structural glasses have been for
the case of fragile glass formers.
It is an open ques-
tion whether the behavior of dynamical heterogeneity in
strong glass formers is also well described by the same
theoretical framework.
In this paper we address pre-
cisely that question. We present here molecular dy-
namics simulation results for the network former SiO2
which is a strong glass former. The van Beest-Kramer-
van Santen (BKS) potential [33] which we use has not
only been shown to be an excellent model for real silica
[34–37] but also previous work of the last 20 years pro-
vides us with detailed insight into many of the properties
of this system, including its phase diagram [38–45], en-
ergy landscape [46–50], structure [34, 35, 39, 40, 51, 52]
[38, 53], vibrational spectrum [37, 54–57], dynamical het-
erogeneities [18, 58–63], and aging [64–67] [68].

Further motivation for the present work is the unex-
pected similarity that has recently been found between
the dynamics of the strong glass former SiO2 and fragile
glass formers [67]. Whereas in Ref. [67] the microscopic
dynamics is studied via single particle jump analysis, we
investigate in this paper whether this surprising similar-
ity of strong and fragile glass dynamics also holds true
for the scaling of dynamical heterogeneities. We ﬁnd not
only that indeed most results conﬁrm universal dynamics,
but we also gain deeper insight into the involved length
and time scales. The scaling of P (fs,r) uncovers the im-
portance of intermediate length scales and the scaling
of C, χ4 and P (fs,r) all indicate a common aging clock
which is the same for Si and O atoms.

II. MODEL AND SIMULATION DETAILS

To model amorphous SiO2 we used the BKS potential
[33]. We carried out molecular dynamics (MD) simula-
tions with NSi = 112 silica atoms and NO = 224 oxygen
atoms, at a constant volume V = (cid:0)16.920468˚A(cid:1)3
which
corresponds to a density ρ = 2.323 g/cm3. For further
details on the interaction see Ref.[66].

At 6000 K we generated 200 independent conﬁgura-
tions (at least 1.63 ns apart) which then were fully equi-
librated at initial temperature Ti = 5000 K for 3.27 ns,
followed by an instantaneous quench to lower tempera-
ture Tf = 2500 K, i.e. below Tc = 3330 K. Unique to our

2

simulations is that we applied the Nos´e-Hoover temper-
ature bath at Tf only for the ﬁrst 0.327 ns (NVT) and
then continued with constant energy (NVE) for 98.1 ns
to disturb the dynamics minimally. We conﬁrmed that Tf
stays constant and is similar to Tf (t) as shown in Fig. 2 of
Ref.[66]. The MD time step was 1.02 fs and 1.6 fs during
the (NVT) and (NVE) runs respectively. In what follows
we analyzed the combined (NVT) and (NVE) simulation
runs at Tf .

The main diﬀerence between the present simulation
and the ones discussed in Refs. [51, 66, 67] is that our new
dataset has increased statistics (200 independent runs in-
stead of 20) and that each NVE run at Tf has a longer
duration (98.1 ns instead of 32.7 ns). As described in
section Sec. III, this increased statistics and the longer
simulation runs allowed us to gain insight into the scaling
of the two point correlation function C α signiﬁcantly be-
yond the results of Ref. [66]. Furthermore, having 200 in-
dependent simulation runs gave good enough statistics to
make it possible to determine the dynamic susceptibility
and the distribution of the local incoherent intermediate
scattering function (see Secs IV and V).

III. GLOBAL INCOHERENT INTERMEDIATE

SCATTERING FUNCTION

Let us ﬁrst look at the global generalized incoherent

intermediate scattering function

X

j=1

f α
s (tw, tw+t, q) =

cos(cid:8)q · (cid:0)rj(tw + t) − rj(tw)(cid:1)(cid:9) .
(3)
Here rj (t) is the position of particle j at time t, tw is the
waiting time elapsed since the temperature quench from
5000 K to 2500 K, and Nα is the total number of particles
of type α (α ∈ {Si, O, all}). The notation h. . .i indicates
an average over wave vectors q of ﬁxed magnitude q and
over the 200 independent simulation runs.
In Eq. (3)
the sum is over particles in the complete simulation box,
whereas in Sec. V the sum is only over particles within
a local sub-box. We call C α the “global” incoherent in-
termediate scattering function to stress this distinction.
Error bars for C α are given by the statistical error of the
average over the 200 independent simulation runs. Even
though averaging over 200 independent runs allows us to
remove a lot of the noise in the results, we further smooth
the results by additionally applying a time average. The
time average is computed by using logarithmic time bins
and by averaging t-values, C α-values and error bars ∆C α
within the same time bin.

Unique to the present work is that we investigate di-
rectly the inﬂuence of particle type on scaling. To do
so, we distinguish three diﬀerent cases, labeled by the

symbol α. In the case of α =Si the sum in Eq. (2) is ex-
clusively over Si atoms and in the case of α =O the sum
is exclusively over O atoms. In the third case, α =all,
the sum is over all particles, i.e. including both Si and O
atoms. We use this notation throughout the whole paper,
including in our discussion of the dynamic susceptibility
χ4 and the probability distribution P (fs,r).

this ﬁgure and in most other ﬁgures where results for diﬀerent
waiting times are compared, statistical error bars are shown for
just one of the waiting times.

Fig. 1 shows C α(tw, tw + t, q) for oxygen atoms and for
q = 2.7˚A−1. We ﬁnd that with increasing waiting time tw
the correlation function decays more slowly. To quantify
this we deﬁne the relaxation time τ α

Instead of the commonly used choice C α

cut = 1/e, we
adjust to the varying plateau height of C α(q) for diﬀerent
q. Hence for C α
cut(q) we choose the values listed in Table I,
each of which is given by 1/e times the corresponding
plateau value of C α(q).

from Figs. 1 and 2.
In Ref. [66] it was found that for
small waiting times, tw . 0.1 ns, C α(tw, tw + t) does not
form a plateau, for intermediate tw a plateau is formed
and time superposition applies, and for suﬃciently large
waiting times C α becomes tw-independent, i.e. equilib-
rium is reached. The increased statistics of the present
simulations allow the identiﬁcation in Fig. 2 of the tran-
sition from small to intermediate tw as a change in the
tw dependence of the relaxation times τ α(tw) from non-
power law to power law behavior. Fig. 2 also shows that
τ α
q (tw) does not reach a plateau, i.e. the waiting times
are not long enough to reach equilibrium.

Let us next investigate further the dynamics for inter-
mediate waiting times tw & 0.1 ns. The inset in Fig. 2
shows the power law ﬁt exponents µ as functions of wave
vector q. We ﬁnd that within the error bars, µ seems to
be independent of q for q ≥ 2.7˚A−1. Similar results for
τ (tw) have been found experimentally for a metallic glass
[69] and for a colloidal glass [70]. The inset in Fig. 2 also
shows that µ is independent of the particle type α. (The
particle type is indicated by a square for α =O and by
a rhombus for α =all.) This independence of α is rather
surprising, since Horbach and Kob had found that the
dynamics of silicon and oxygen atoms is very diﬀerent
for temperatures below 3330 K [35]. Saksaengwijit and
Heuer [71] relate this decoupling of silicon and oxygen
dynamics to rotational processes.

We interpret the α-independence of µ as an evidence
for the existence of a common “single aging clock” in
the system, despite the diﬀerent dynamics of Si and O
atoms. This allows us to analyze Si and O atoms to-
gether (α =all). To directly test the hypothesis of a sin-

FIG. 3. (color online) To study directly the dependence of the
global
incoherent intermediate scattering function C α on the
particle type α, we show here two parametric plots of C O versus
C Si for various waiting times tw: one for q = 2.7˚A−1 (main
panel) and another for q = 1.7˚A−1 (inset).

gle aging clock, we generalize an approach introduced
by Kob and Barrat [72]. They had investigated the q-
dependence of C α via a parametric plot of C α(q2) ver-
sus C α(q1) for various tw. Whereas for their system, a
binary Lennard-Jones system, they found no data col-
lapse [72], for our system, SiO2, it was found in Ref. [66]
that data collapse indeed happens. This indicates that
C α(tw, tw + t, q) = C α(˜z(tw, t, α), q) [66]. In other words,
for each particle type α there is a unique q-independent
aging clock represented by ˜z(tw, t, α). Notably, this is the
only non-universal result we encounter in our comparison
of the dynamics of fragile and strong glass formers. We
now address the question of the existence of a common
aging clock for Si and O atoms, in other words, whether
or not the function ˜z(tw, t, α) is independent of α. The
question is therefore whether it is true that

C α(tw, tw + t, q) ≡ C(tw, tw + t, q, α)
?
= C(z(tw, t), q, α) .

(5)

To answer this question we investigate directly the α-
dependence via a parametric plot of CO(tw, tw + t, q) ver-
sus CSi(tw, tw + t, q) as shown in Fig. 3 for q = 2.7˚A−1
(and in the inset for q = 1.7˚A−1). We ﬁnd almost per-
fect data collapse for all investigated q, and conclude that
Eq. (5) is correct. Hence the (tw, t)-dependence is solely
governed by one function z(tw, t), i.e. an “inner aging
clock” which is not only q-independent but also the same
for diﬀerent particle types.

This may appear surprising at ﬁrst, since, as mentioned
before, it is known that in SiO2 the oxygen atoms have a
faster dynamics than the silicon atoms [35, 71]. Our re-
sults do not contradict this statement. To illustrate how

FIG. 4. (color online) This ﬁgure illustrates the compatibility of
Si and O atoms having both diﬀerent speeds as well as a common
clock. For each tw the corresponding (tw + t) was determined to
obtain the speciﬁed C α = C α(tw, tw + t, q = 2.7˚A−1) with 1%
accuracy. The solid lines are for the guidance of the eye. The
common clock is apparent by identical curves for silicon (circles)
and oxygen (triangles). The fact that the dynamics of O atoms is
faster than the dynamics of Si atoms is reﬂected by the constant
value of C O being lower than the corresponding constant value
of C Si on the same curve.

to reconcile a common clock and yet diﬀerent dynamics
of Si and O atoms, we show in Fig. 4 (tw, tw + t)-pairs
for ﬁxed C α. For example, the blue circles of the bottom
curve were obtained by ﬁnding for each tw the corre-
sponding tw + t for which CSi(tw, tw + t, q = 2.7˚A−1) =
0.575 with 1% accuracy. For equilibrium dynamics, this
curve would be trivial: it would be the set of (tw, tw + t)-
pairs for a certain constant value of t. For aging dy-
namics, the curve is non-trivial: t changes as tw changes.
Nevertheless, we obtain the same non-trivial curve for O
atoms (blue triangles) for ﬁxed CO = 0.463. Similarly
we obtain identical curves for Si atoms (circles) and oxy-
gen atoms (triangles) for diﬀerent choices of CSi and CO
(upper three curves), hence a common clock for Si and O
atoms. The fact that the dynamics of O atoms is faster
than the dynamics of Si atoms is reﬂected by the constant
value of CO being lower than the corresponding constant
value of CSi on the same curve.

IV. DYNAMIC SUSCEPTIBILITY

In this section we study the dynamic susceptibility, χα
4 ,
which is a four-point correlation function. χα
4 quantiﬁes
thermal ﬂuctuations of the incoherent intermediate scat-
tering function. Following the notation of Berthier [17]

vide the 200 independent simulation runs into 20 subsets
each of 10 independent simulation runs, and compute a
value χ(α,i)
for each subset i, with i = 1, · · · , 20. The
error bar of χα
4 is the standard deviation of the mean
over those 20 independent χ(α,i)
values. As in the case
of C α, we further smooth the results for χα
4 by apply-
ing a time average using logarithmic time bins. This
means that for each logarithmic bin all unsmoothed data
(t, χ4, ∆χ4) which occur at a time t within the speciﬁed
bin time window, are averaged to (t, χ4, ∆χ4).

Fig. 5 shows the resulting dynamic susceptibility for
oxygen atoms and q = 2.7˚A−1. Since χα
4 is a four-point
correlation function, it is a measure of dynamic hetero-
geneities. The dynamic susceptibility is small both for
very short times and for very large times t and it has a
maximum χα
max. This maxi-
mum can be interpreted as a maximal number of particles
in a dynamically correlated region. For a thorough dis-
cussion of this maximum and its scaling dependence on
temperature and system size in the case of a supercooled
liquid and a dense granular system see Refs. [16, 17, 74].
We investigate here instead the aging dynamics and thus
the dependence of χα
4 on waiting time tw. To quantify the
dependence of this maximum on tw, q and α, we show the
peak height χα
max as functions
of tw in Figs. 6 and 7 respectively. Similar to previous re-
sults in fragile glass formers [13, 20, 21, 23–25] χα

We next address the question of how the dynamic sus-
ceptibility scales with respect to waiting time. As de-
scribed in the introduction, numerical simulations for
fragile glasses ﬁnd [13, 20, 21, 25] a scaling behavior of
the (tw, t) dependence of the dynamic susceptibility given
by

χα

4 (tw, tw + t, q) = χmax(tw, q, α) φ(C(z(tw, t), q, α), q, α).
(9)
The dependence on time t enters in Eq.(9) only via C
and therein only through z(tw, t), where z is independent
of q, as has been shown in Ref. [66], and independent of
α, as shown above in Fig. 3. Therefore we have

4 (tw, tw + t, q) = χ0
χα

4(tw, q, α) φ(C α(tw, tw + t, q), q, α).
(7)
A similar more general result follows from Ref. [75].
Without loss of generality, we choose χ0
4(tw, q, α) in
Eq. (7) to be the maximum height χα
max. To test the
4 /χα
validity of Eq. (7), we plot in Fig. 8 χα
max as a func-
tion of (1 − C α) for the case of oxygen atoms (α =O)
and q = 2.7˚A−1 (for details see endnote [76].) Fig. 8
shows indeed data collapse within the error bars. To
quantify how good this data collapse is, we determine
the left crossing point of a horizontal line at 0.6 in Fig. 8,
(1 − C α)cross is deﬁned as the smaller of the two

Fig. 9 shows the resulting (1 − C α)cross as a function
of tw for α =O, for q = 1.7˚A−1, 2.7˚A−1, 3.4˚A−1, and
4.6˚A−1. To a ﬁrst approximation, (1−C α)cross is waiting
time independent, consistent with Eq. (7). However, a
slight systematic increase of (1−C α)cross with tw appears
to be present, which may be evidence for the existence of
small corrections to Eq. (7).

where ˆχ(z, q, α) is a tw-independent function in the sense
that all (t, tw)-dependence enters only via z. This means
that a parametric plot of χα

of χα
max for q = q1, with q2 6= q1, should show data
collapse. In Fig. 10, we show a parametric plot of this
kind, for q2 = 2.7˚A−1, q1 = 1.7˚A−1 and α =O, and ﬁnd
that indeed there is data collapse within the error bars.
We also ﬁnd similar results for other values of q2, q1 and

For the dependence on particle type, α, Eq. 10 predicts
that there should also be data collapse in a parametric
plot of (χO
max). This data collapse
is conﬁrmed with Fig. 11 for q = 2.7˚A−1. We ﬁnd equally
good collapse for all other investigated q values. We em-
phasize that the data collapse shown in Figs. 10 and 11 is
non-trivial, in the sense that the data are not along the
diagonal, implying that the shape of χα
max (1 − C α)
does depend both on α and q. However, z(tw, t) is inde-
pendent of q and α and therefore the (tw, t)-dependence
of χ4 is uniquely speciﬁed via C α, which is a function of
z(tw, t).

We now investigate the dependence of χ4 on wave vec-
tor q and particle type α. We use Eq.(5) to rewrite Eq.(7)

The common aging clock for Si and O atoms allows for
the analysis of Si and O atoms together, thus leading to

V. DISTRIBUTION OF LOCAL INCOHERENT

INTERMEDIATE SCATTERING FUNCTION

In the previous section we found scaling for the dy-
namic susceptibility, which can be thought of as a mea-
sure of the thermal ﬂuctuations of the global incoherent
intermediate scattering function f α
s (tw, tw + t, q). In this
section we present results on the probability distribution
for the local coarse grained intermediate scattering func-
tion

f α
s,r(tw, tw + t, q)) =

(11)

r X
N α

rj (tw)∈Br

cos (q · [rj(tw + t) − rj (tw)]) ,

where the sum is over particles of type α which are at
time tw within a local sub-box Br. By contrast, in Eq. (3)
the sum is over all particles in the system. Our deﬁni-
tion of fs,r is identical to the deﬁnition of Cr in Refs. [9–
11, 26, 28]. We choose a diﬀerent notation here to em-
phasize the fact that fs,r is not an ensemble-averaged
quantity. By deﬁnition fs,r = 1 for t = 0. Relaxation
in a region corresponds to the decay of the value of fs,r
from 1 to 0. Spatial ﬂuctuations of fs,r quantify dynami-
cal heterogeneities: the “slow” regions have values of fs,r
that remain non-negligible for a longer time, and “fast”
regions correspond to local values of fs,r that decay more
rapidly towards 0.

s,r(tw, tw + t, q)) of the local correlations f α

In the following we determine the probability distri-
bution P (f α
s,r.
As described in §I, a Landau-theory approximation for
spin glasses [9–11, 26–29, 32] predicts for this distribu-
tion P (f α
s,r) that all (tw, t)-dependence is solely governed

by C α(tw, tw + t, q). This is rather surprising, since the
prediction is for the full distribution P (f α
s,r) of these local
ﬂuctuations, yet C α(tw, tw + t, q) is not only a scalar but
also a global quantity which is equal to the average

C α(tw, tw + t, q) = hf α

s (tw, tw + t, q)i .

(12)

The theory therefore predicts that, if (tw, t) pairs are cho-
sen such that C α(tw, tw + t, q) is ﬁxed, the corresponding
P (f α
s,r) should be tw independent. This data collapse
has been conﬁrmed for spin glasses [9, 11] and for fragile
structural glass formers [12, 13, 21, 30]. In this section
we investigate the scaling of P (f α
s,r(tw, tw + t, q)) for our
SiO2 simulation data, i.e. for a strong glass former.

As will be shown below, we ﬁnd that the goodness of
the scaling depends on the involved length scales via q
and via the chosen size of the local sub-box Br. Since the
speciﬁcs of the analysis inﬂuence the chosen length scales,
we include in the following all necessary details. Our pro-
cedure for the choice of sub-box size and the correspond-
ing set of sub-boxes within the complete simulation box
of length L = 16.9205˚A is as follows: We ﬁrst divide the
simulation box into very small sub-boxes of length L/M .
The length of a sub-box Br is then an integer b times this
very small sub-box, i.e. L × b/M . The average number
of particles in Br is therefore hNri = Nα(b/M )3. We
present in this paper results for hNri ≈ 5 and hNri ≈ 40
as listed in Table II. The distribution P (f α
s,r(tw, tw +t, q))

is then obtained for a speciﬁc set of (tw, t, q, α) and for
a speciﬁc simulation run via measurements of f α
s,r for
all M 3 possible Br and for all q-vectors of magnitude
q. To obtain the M 3 possible sub-boxes Br, the sub-box
is shifted in the three directions and periodic boundary
conditions were used.

To test whether the (tw, t) dependence of P (f α

s,r) is gov-
erned by C α(tw, tw + t, q), we use the same approach as
in previous work [12, 13, 21, 30]. We choose a ﬁxed value
Cﬁx of the global C α, and for each waiting time tw we de-
termine the time tﬁx such that C α(tw, tw + tﬁx, q) = Cﬁx
(see endnote [77].) We then determine for each inde-
pendent simulation run c = 1, 2, . . . , 200, a distribution
Pc(f α
s,r(tw, tw + tﬁx, q)), using for Eq. 11 the positions
{ri(tw)}c and {ri(tw + tﬁx)}c. Please note that the pa-
rameters tw, tw + tﬁx and q are common to all simulation
runs. For each bin of the distribution, we obtain the
mean Pc(f α
s,r(tw, tw + tﬁx, q)) over the 200 independent
simulation runs. The error bars represent the standard
deviation of this mean over runs. The result of this com-
putation is shown in Fig. 13 for the case of α =O and
hNri = 5.1.

FIG. 13. (color online) Distribution of the local incoherent in-
termediate scattering function for oxygen atoms, P (f O
s,r), for
q = 2.7˚A−1 and hNri = 5.1.

For small C α we ﬁnd perfect scaling collapse and the
distribution is a Gaussian (black dashed line). We at-
tribute the Gaussian distribution to small C α occurring
at late times t (see Fig. 1) when diﬀusive dynamics is
approached. For intermediate and large C α we ﬁnd a
non-Gaussian, i.e. non-trivial P (fs,r), and nevertheless
very good data collapse. To check quantitatively whether
the slight tw dependence in Figs. 13 is systematic, we fo-
cus on the location of most discrepancy, the maximum.
Fig. 14 shows the maximum value P α
max of the distribu-
tion, as a function of tw. Consistent with the results
above, we ﬁnd that for small tw scaling is not valid, but
for tw & 0.1 ns P α
max is approximately independent of tw.
We obtain similar results for q > 2.7˚A−1 and also for
α =Si.

To probe the dependence of P (f α

s,r) on particle type α,
we show in the inset of Fig. 15 the comparison of P (f α
s,r)
for α =Si, O, all. We conclude that P (f α
s,r) does depend
on α. In previous sections §III and §IV we had found that
despite diﬀerent dynamics of silicon and oxygen atoms,
their scaling z(tw, t) gives rise to a common aging clock.
This common clock allows us to analyze Si and O to-
gether (α =all). To test this common aging clock for the
case of P (f α

So far we have shown P (f α

s,r) for various ﬁxed C α, for
q = 2.7 ˚A−1, hNri ≈ 5, with either α =O or α =all.
When also q and hNri are varied, we ﬁnd that the pre-
dicted data collapse occurs as long as tw & 0.1 ns, q ≥ 2.7
˚A−1 and hNri ≈ 5. Next we look at cases when scaling
fails. Fig. 16 shows P (f α
s,r) for hNri ≈ 5 as before, but
now q = 1.7˚A−1. For CO = 0.3 and CO = 0.5 we ﬁnd
that the data collapse for diﬀerent tw is much worse than
before. This is quantiﬁed in the inset of Fig. 16, which

shows the systematic tw dependence of P O

set also shows that in the Gaussian case of CO = 0.1,
the scaling does work even for q = 1.7˚A−1. Furthermore,
when the sub-box size is chosen to be much larger, scaling
does not occur even if q ≥ 2.7˚A−1, as shown in Fig. 17
for the case of hNri ≈ 42.

corresponding to intermediate C α, when the regions
probed by the local incoherent intermediate scattering
function fs,r become too large. Those probed regions can
become larger either directly, because the coarse graining
region is chosen to be larger, or indirectly, because q is
chosen to be smaller, thus allowing longer displacements
to contribute signiﬁcantly to fs,r.

Thus scaling breaks down for intermediate timescales,

One eﬀect that could contribute to the imperfect col-

lapse is that the measured probability distribution could
be inﬂuenced to some degree by spatial correlation ef-
fects, and these eﬀects could vary as the system ages and
the typical size of the correlated regions grows. In the
case of fragile glasses [12], it was found that the width of
P (fs,r) grew with tw at constant C α. In that case it was
argued that P (fs,r) was narrowed by averaging of fs,r
over more than one correlated region, but this narrowing
became weaker as the size of the correlated regions grew
with tw.
In our case, however, we notice in the insets
of Figs. 16 and 17 that the direction of the eﬀect is not
always the same: the distributions widen with increasing
tw for C O = 0.3, but they narrow with increasing tw for
C O = 0.5. Therefore, for SiO2, although this narrowing
eﬀect could in principle play some role, there must also
be other eﬀects at play.

In what follows we address the question of why scaling
fails and how to adjust the analysis to recover the data
collapse even for larger length scales (q = 1.7 ˚A−1 and
hNri ≈ 40). To gain this insight, ﬁrst a closer look at the
details of the analysis is necessary. A crucial point is how
we choose the time pairs, i.e. tw and tw + t. We illustrate
in Fig. 18 how this is done. First we choose a unique
t = tﬁx — the same for all 200 independent simulation
runs — by demanding that the global incoherent scatter-
ing function C α(tw, tw + t) (thick line in Fig. 18) take a
certain value at t = tﬁx, such as C α(tw, tw + tﬁx) = 0.5.
If we now look at individual runs, the intermediate
scattering function computed for each run c is C α
c = hfsic
where h. . .ic corresponds to an average over q vectors
of ﬁxed magnitude but not over simulation runs. Since
the system simulated in each independent run contains
only 336 particles, it is not large enough for C α
c to be
self-averaging: in Fig. 18, the values of C α
c (tw, tw + tﬁx)
for four individual runs are shown with circles, and they
diﬀer dramatically from each other and from the value
of the fully averaged C α(tw, tw + tﬁx). In other words,
choosing a unique value t = tﬁx is equivalent to choosing
very diﬀerent values for C α
for each simulation run c.
c
Consequently, the distributions P (fs,r(tw, tw + t, q)) at
the same times are necessarily very diﬀerent for diﬀerent
runs c.

In Fig. 19, single simulation run distributions Pc(f O

s,r)
for four independent runs are shown as thin black lines,
and it is clear that the variation of Pc(f O
s,r) between runs
is very large: there is a nontrivial distribution of distri-
butions. For comparison, the average over runs P (f O
s,r) is
shown in the same ﬁgure with a thick black line. All of
the black lines in the ﬁgure correspond to tw = 0.49 ns.
In the same ﬁgure, results are shown for another wait-
ing time, tw = 33.0 ns, as magenta/grey lines:
the
thin lines corresponding to Pc(f O
s,r) for individual runs
c, and the thick line corresponding to P (f O
Also,
for tw = 33.0 ns the distributions Pc(f O
s,r) vary greatly
from simulation run to simulation run. Yet, the set of
possible Pc(f O
s,r) seem to be the same for the two wait-
ing times. We ﬁnd that for obtaining a particular shape
of Pc(f α
ﬁx) (marked by cir-

s,r), the key variable is C α

case, with the lowest wavevector we have considered,
the largest coarse graining region, and including both O
and Si atoms (which additionally tests whether the aging
clock is the same for both particle types). Even for this
most unfavorable case, we ﬁnd almost perfect scaling.
We thus conclude that C α

quantity.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

In summary, we have performed molecular dynamics
simulations of the strong glass former SiO2 to investigate
the scaling of dynamical heterogeneities in this system.
We have quenched the system from an initial high tem-
perature Ti to a ﬁnal temperature Tf below the mode-
coupling critical temperature Tc, and observed the out of
equilibrium dynamics as a function of the waiting time
tw, the time elapsed since the temperature quench. In
particular, we have investigated the global incoherent in-
termediate scattering function C α(tw, tw + t, q), the dy-
namic susceptibility χα
4 (tw, tw +t, q), and the distribution
P (f α
s,r(tw, tw + t, q)) of the local incoherent intermediate
scattering function, where q corresponds to the wave vec-
tor magnitude and α speciﬁes the particle type.

We have found that for suﬃciently long waiting times
tw, and when probing small enough regions in the sys-
tem, the dependence on (tw, t) of χα
4 (tw, tw + t, q) and of
P (f α
s,r(tw, tw +t, q)) is governed by C α(tw, tw +t, q), up to
a tw-dependent scale factor in χ4. This is consistent with
predictions for spin glasses and similar to previous results
for fragile glass formers. We thus conclude that the be-
havior of dynamical heterogeneity in the aging regime of
glassy systems shows a remarkable degree of universal-
ity. A similarity of the behavior for strong and fragile
glass formers had previously been shown for the micro-
scopic dynamics of single particle jumps [67], but here we
have shown that it extends to the scaling of dynamical

heterogeneities.

Furthermore we have studied directly the inﬂuence of
the particle type α on the dynamics. We have found that
C α(tw, tw + t, q) = C(z(tw, t), q, α), where z(tw, t) is in-
dependent of q and α. Thus z(tw, t) plays the role of
a “common aging clock” that determines the slow aging
behavior of the relaxation for both Si and O atoms. By
combining this statement with the fact, discussed above,
s,r) is controlled by C α,
that the aging of χα
it follows that the aging of χα
s,r) for both Si
and O atoms should be controlled by that same unique
aging clock. Our results show that this prediction is in-
deed satisﬁed. In summary, we have found that both the
average and the ﬂuctuations of the slow aging dynamics
are controlled by a unique aging clock, which is indepen-
dent of the wavevector q and is the same for O and Si
atoms.

4 and of P (f α

When ﬂuctuations are probed over larger regions, ei-
ther by taking q ≤ 1.7 ˚A−1, or by considering larger
coarse graining regions containing around 40 particles,
new phenomena emerge, presumably due at least in part
to the fact that the probed regions contain more than one
correlation volume. In particular, the scaling of P (fs,r)
discussed above no longer holds in its initial form. It is
clear that the probability distributions Pc(fs,r) obtained
from the independent runs c = 1, · · · , 200 vary dramati-
cally from run to run if the time interval is kept the same
across runs. In other words, there is a nontrivial distribu-

12

tion of distributions. This is equivalent to the statement
that, in a very large system, a measurement of P (fs,r)
over a mesoscopic region containing a few hundred par-
ticles is not self-averaging, and that a new signiﬁcant in-
termediate lengthscale emerges. It is, however, possible
to recover an excellent collapse of probability distribu-
tions for diﬀerent waiting times tw if instead of averaging
probability distributions Pc(fs,r) from diﬀerent runs (or
mesoscopic regions) at constant time interval t = tﬁx,
one averages probability distributions taken at constant
mesoscopic intermediate scattering function C α

meso.

[73] In the ensemble used in our simulations the numbers of
both O and Si atoms are kept constant, and our def-
inition of dynamic susceptibility describes ﬂuctuations
in that particular ensemble. The dynamic susceptibility
in a diﬀerent ensemble could have a diﬀerent value [15].
For example, a possible alternative would be an ensemble
that allows particle number ﬂuctuations, thus yielding an
extra contribution that would increase the value of the
dynamic susceptibility. We do not pursue such alterna-
tive in the present work.

[76] To preserve scaling, the details of smoothing data needs
care. We used the smoothed data of Fig. 5 to determine
χα
max which is identical to the values of Fig. 6. We then
determined for each tw the unsmoothed data χα
as function of (1 − C α). The thus obtained unsmoothed
data were then smoothed via linear binning of (1 − C α).
[77] A desired C α value can be achieved only up to a cer-
tain accuracy, because during any simulation run conﬁg-
urations are saved only at certain discrete times. Of the
available conﬁgurations, we choose the one for which C α
is the closest to Cﬁx. Results are reported only for cases
when C α is within 1% of the chosen Cﬁx value.

[78] To be precise, for tw = 0.49 ns the lowest possible C O

c is
0.165, which was chosen here. For all other cases shown
in Fig. 19 the target value of C O
is achieved with 1%
accuracy or better.

[79] In our analysis we only use simulation runs c for which
there exist times such that Eq. 13 is satisﬁed within an
accuracy of 1% or better.
