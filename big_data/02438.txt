A Mathematical Model of Foreign Capital Inﬂow

Gopal K. Basak∗, Pranab Kumar Das†, Allena Rohit‡

March 9, 2016

Abstract

The paper models foreign capital inﬂow from the developed to the developing countries
in a stochastic dynamic programming framework. The model is solved by numerical technique
because of the non-linearity of the functions. A number of comparative dynamic analyses explore
the impact of parameters of the model on dynamic paths of capital inﬂow, interest rate in the
international loan market and the exchange rate. The model also explores the possibility of
ﬁnancial crisis originating either in the developed country or in the developing country. The
explanation of crisis in this structure is based on trade theoretic terms in a dynamic terms of
trade framework rather than due to informational imperfections.

1 Introduction

The paper develops a simple model of foreign capital inﬂow in a multi period dynamic programming
frame work. Typically capital ﬂows from the developed to the developing countries owing to a higher
rate of return in the latter because of scarcity of capital and thus a higher marginal product of
capital than in the developed countries which are capital rich with a lower marginal product of
capital.1 The foreign capital supplements the domestic resources of the developing countries for

achieving a higher rate of capital formation and hence higher rate of economic growth. Generally
developing countries are characterized by consistent current account deﬁcit. This together with
a higher interest rate creates a natural condition for ﬂow of capital from the developed to the
developing countries. The inﬂow to the borrowing country helps appreciate the domestic currency
followed by rise in asset prices and local goods prices which via favourable ﬁscal conditions further
encourages domestic credit creation. Repayment of loans in the next period has an adverse eﬀect
on exchange rate resulting into depreciation of exchange rate. This does not matter as long as
inﬂow is suﬃcient. The crisis situation occurs particularly when the rate of capital inﬂow reaches
a plateau or the global investors ﬁnd a new country with even a higher rate of return then the
new paradigm looks shop worn; a sudden stop a la Calvo (1998) to capital inﬂow or a reversal
of current account balance leading to asset price contraction, decreased domestic investment and
the economy adjusts backwards. In an extreme situation depreciation of domestic currency makes
debt servicing diﬃcult which can lead to a foreign exchange crisis or banking crisis or both (see
Reinhart and Reinhart, 2008; Reinhart and Rogoﬀ, 2009; Wolf, 2008). 2 The crisis may further
get aggravated by bad macroeconomic management on ﬁscal and monetary fronts. The problem
of debt servicing arises because capital inﬂow to developing countries are typically pegged in hard
currency which has been termed as ’original sin’ (Eichengreen and Hausman, 1999; Eichengreen,
Hausman and Panizza, 2005).

In a simple two period model the potential of ﬁnancial crisis emanating from the depreciation of
exchange rate at the time of repayment of foreign currency loans was modeled by Marjit, Das
and Bardhan (2007). The argument is based on simple text book explanation of terms of trade
eﬀect based on trade theoretic argument as in Caves et al 1993; Helpman and Krugman, 1989.
When all the producers sell in the international market at a given world price the combined supply
reduces the world price though no individual seller or even a country can aﬀect world price. The
same argument applies in the context of capital inﬂow in a two period framework. It is argued
that the terms of trade eﬀect may dominate leading to a ﬁnancial crisis. Basak, Das and Marjit
(2012) extended the model by introducing repayment of previous period borrowing. It adds multi
period dynamics in the structure for a better understanding of the possibility of crisis. Costinot
et al. (2014) has argued for capital control on the basis of dynamic terms of trade in the same
spirit as in this paper. The present paper is a formalization of the process of capital inﬂow in
an inﬁnite horizon set up with micro foundations of the choice problem of the agents - borrowers
and lenders. The model investigates the eﬀect of an increase in the perception of risk of default
of international loan in the lending country, shift in the expectation of the future exchange rate
or decreased productivity in the domestic sector in the borrowing country on capital inﬂow. The
issue pertaining to the origin of the ﬁnancial crisis in the process of inﬂow is also discussed.

With this short introduction the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 formulates a model of capital
inﬂow in a two country setup, a borrowing country and a lending country. From the individual
optimization exercise we derive equilibria in the two markets, viz.
international loan market and
the foreign exchange market which are then solved for the interest rate in the international loan

2General empirical evidence can be found in Bordo and Meissner (2005); Bussi`ere et al (2004) while country speciﬁc
evidence can be found in Dominguez and Tesar (2005), Goldfajn and Minella (2005), Noland (2005). East Asian crisis
of 1997 has been extensively discussed by Allen and Gale (2007), Krugman (1998), Gorton (2008), Rakshit (2002).

market and exchange rate by numerical method. In section 3, we undertake comparative dynamic
exercises of changes in parameter values. The ﬁnal section concludes.

2 The Model

We consider a two-country model with one borrowing (developing) and another lending (developed)
country. The two country framework is an abstraction from the reality where the two countries
represent two country groups. The borrowing country group is capital scarce, thus has a higher
marginal product of capital and hence a higher domestic interest rates whereas the lending country
has lower domestic interest rates as this group is capital rich. 3 Actual borrowing-lending takes
place through banks or ﬁnancial intermediaries, there is no direct lending. A typical bank in the
developing country borrows from both the domestic and international markets and lends to domestic
production sector while a typical bank in the developed country borrows from domestic sector and
lends to both the domestic and international borrowers. 4 The developing country banks have to
repay the foreign debt along with the interest rate in the next period denominated in the lending
country’s currency, i.e., hard currency. International loan market is assumed to be competitive so
that the international loan rate is given to both lending country and borrowing country banks. We
do not consider the determination of domestic borrowing or lending rates of interest in the model.
It is only the interest rate on foreign borrowing/ lending and the exchange rate that are determined
in this model. Each bank in both the developed and the developing countries maximize discounted
expected utility over inﬁnite horizon, speciﬁcally an intertemporal mean-variance utility function,
by choice of their portfolio of borrowing and lending.

2.1 Developed country

Competitive banking in the developed country ensures that all banks are symmetric so that each
one of them raise the same amount of deposit, assumed to be KD
in each period. Number of banks
t
is assumed to be mD. We deﬁne, at time period t rD
t = interest
rate on domestic loans, R∗
t = interest rate on international loan, Ft = total funds at the disposal
of the bank. The bank lends µt fraction in the international market the rest in the international
market with a risk of default t for the foreign loan deﬁned as

t = interest rate paid on deposits, RD

1 with probability pt,

t =

0 with probability 1 − pt, 0 ∈ [0, 1).

3The borrowing country group resembles the emerging market economies among the developing countries with
high growth potential such as China, India, Brazil, South Africa etc. These economies are attractive location for
international capital compared to the least developed countries of Africa or Asia.

4In recent times a few emerging market economy ﬁrms have been borrowing directly in the international market,
but major part of international borrowing takes place via banks or consortium of banks. External Commercial
Borrowing, American Depository Receipts are two prominent examples of such direct borrowing by Indian ﬁrms in
the international market.

Domestic loan has no risk of default. Total funds for lending Ft is the sum of accumulated proﬁt
from the previous period and the amount of new deposits and is given by:

Ft = Ft−1[(1 − µt−1)(1 + RD

t−1) + (µt−1)(1 + R∗

(2.1)

The expected proﬁt of each bank in the current period is given by,

E[πD

and the variance by,

Vt(πD

t (1 + R∗

A typical bank chooses its portfolio to maximize its intertemporal expected proﬁt adjusted for risk
(measured by variance). The instantaneous utility (mean-variance utility function) of a bank in
the developed country at time period t is

t = Et(πD

by choice of µt subject to the funds constraint, where BD is the discount factor assumed same for
all time periods.

The above optimality problem is solved by Bellman optimization technique.[5] The problem of the
bank can be stated in the Bellman framework as
V D(Ft) = maxµt{ΩD

t + BDEt(V D(Ft+1))},

(2.3)

subject to fund constraint (2.1) where V D(Ft) denotes the value function assumed to be stationary.
Since (i) the utility function is concave and the constraint function is linear, (ii) the utility function
is time separable in contemporaneous control and state variables, and (iii) current decision aﬀect
current and future utilities but not the past ones, Bellman principle can be applied here to solve the
dynamic programming problem. In particular, solution would be of the form of quadric function
since the utility function is quadratic. 5 So we let,

V D(Ft) = a + bFt + cF 2
t ,

(2.4)

a, b , c are the coeﬃcients of the value function to be determined. It is to be noted that the value
function needs to be concave to have a unique maximum which is satisﬁed if c is negative.

Theorem 1 Under the linear quadratic framework, for the existence of unique positive solution µt
for all t it is necessary that BD < 1/(1 + RD
t ) > 0.
Further, for all large enough γ the solution µt ∈ (0, 1) exists for all t and is given by

is assumed to solve the Bellman equation.

where b and c are given in (5.8) and (5.12).

For the proof of this theorem please see Appendix A. The intuition of the theorem obtains from
the fact that as µ increases from zero to positive values utility from out of lending increases but the
marginal utility of lending falls with rising γ (i.e., rising perception of risk) and at a high enough γ
the maxima of the utility function achieves at some µ < 1. Thus for a high enough γ, µ is bounded
at unity from above.

2.2 Developing country

We also assume competitive banking in the developing country with total number of banks mU
each of which is symmetric. Number of ﬁrms which borrow from each bank are normalized at
unity. A typical bank raises a fraction λt from the international market at an interest rate R∗
t and
the rest from the domestic market at an interest rate ru
t . These funds are lent to domestic sector
at an interest rates Ru
t with a risk of default arising out of productivity shock denoted by ηt. A
typical bank is assumed to hedge against currency ﬂuctuations by buying a currency forward. Let
us deﬁne et = spot exchange rate at t, ef
t = price of the
forward contract at t. Gt = funds available to each bank at t (accumulated from past proﬁts and
new deposit raised) and is given by
t−1)Gt−1 − KU

t = forward market exchange rate, P f

(2.6)

When foreign exchange markets are either informationally eﬃcient or whenever risk premium is a
non decreasing function of the level of transaction, forward contracts are priced in such a way that
marginal beneﬁt from the contract equals marginal cost of the contract. The last two terms in (2.6)
vanish. Hence, the instantaneous mean variance utility function is given by

subject to fund constraint (2.2) where V U (Gt)is the value function assumed to be stationary and
BU is the discount factor. As in the case of developed country the Bellman principle can be applied
here on the quadratic value function to solve the dynamic programming problem. Thus,

V U (Gt) = x + yGt + zG2

The proof of this theorem is relegated to Appendix B.

It may be noted that for a small value of β (implying low perception of risk) allows the developing
country banks to borrow larger amount, possibly even λ > 1, as long as R∗
t remains lower than the
level given by At > 0. On the other hand, if β is too high then λ can become zero or negative.
Thus for a solution of λ ∈ (0, 1) one must choose a β ∈ (β0, β1), for some 0 < β0 < β1.

2.3 Equilibrium: Existence and Characterization

There are two markets in this model, viz.
international loan market and the foreign exchange
market. Total supply of loans in the international market is the sum total of loans by the developed
country banks and total demand for international loans is the sum total of demand by individual
banks in the developing country. In equilibrium aggregate demand equals aggregate supply at each
t so that

mDµ∗

.

(2.10)

The R.H.S is aggregate demand and the L.H.S. is aggregate supply of loans. It may be noted that
developing country banks cannot raise loans from the international market at their home currency,
it has to be in hard currency, such as US Dollar or EURO. The equilibrium in the foreign exchange
market is obtained by the equality of the demand for foreign exchange comprising of repayment of

loans of previous period and the supply comprising of net exports plus current period loan. The
current net exports is assumed to be a linear increasing function of current period exchange rate,

Nt = −N0 + N1et

(2.11)

where N1 equals relative price of foreign goods (imports) vis-`a-vis home goods (exports), with
N1 > 0 and both N0, N1 following uniform distribution in the intervals (N01, N02) and (N11, N12)
respectively and N0 > 0. Stochastic coeﬃcients of the net export function adds dynamics to the
model. It is clear from (2.11) that net exports is actually rising function of price of foreign goods
expressed in home currency relative to price of home goods. It may be noted that at zero exchange
rate or a very low price of foreign goods relative to home goods there is a negative net exports, i.e.
there is positive imports. The equilibrium in the foreign exchange market is given by

(2.12)

The LHS gives the supply of foreign exchange while the RHS the demand for foreign exchange.
Equations (2.10), (2.12) (with substitutions from (2.5), (2.9)) simultaneously determine, R∗
t and
e∗
t at each t corresponding to realizations of random shocks in the respective periods. Accordingly
we get the dynamics of capital inﬂow, interest rate and exchange rate. Existence of equilibrium
solutions are given by the following theorem.

t ) < 1 ⇒ BDEt(X 2

The value function in each case is assumed to be stationary. If c < 0 and z < 0 then the value
function is concave which in turn ensures existence of unique maximum for each of the borrowing
and lending country banks respectively. It readily follows from (5.8)that c < 0 if and only if 0 <
BDEt(X 2
t )2Vt(t)] < 1
and 0 < BD < 1. So the condition is easily satisﬁed provided BD is small enough to make the
t )2Et(η2) < 1 for the developing
product less than unity. Similarly z < 0 if and only if 0 < BU (1+RU
country banks. We need another condition on the interest rate on international loan for positive
amount of foreign borrowing by developing country banks. The developed country bank lends only
when the expected return from the loan is greater than the return from domestic deposits i.e.,

t )Et(t)]2 + µ∗2

t (1 + R∗

(1 + R∗

t )Et(t) > (1 + RD

t ) is also a necessary condition for µ∗

t > 0.

The developing country bank borrows only when the international interest rate adjusted for the
exchange rate is less than the domestic interest rate i.e.,

(1 + R∗

t )Et(

t ) is also a necessary condition for λ∗

t > 0.

In the next section, the endogenous variables, viz. R∗
t , et and capital inﬂow are numerically solved
for given initial values and parameters of the model and explain how the equilibria behave over
time.

2.4 Simulation

The two equations, (2.10) and (2.12)solve for equilibrium values of R∗
t and µt for a given parametric
conﬁguration and exogenous variables. We run the simulation for 30 time periods. It may be noted
that the algorithm used for ﬁnding the equilibrium values of the endogenous variables employs a
version of E-M Algorithm (Estimation Maximization employed in Maximum Likelihood Estimation
in econometrics) in a dynamic setup. Given below the initial values chosen for two countries and
values for parameters of the model equilibrium values are calculated using the algorithm provided
in Appendix D. We have set BD = BU = 0.7, G0 = KU and F0 = KD. In the entire analysis we
have assumed that the new deposits raised KU

It is evident from the above ﬁgures that capital inﬂow and exchange rate follow stationary pattern
while international interest rate shows a rising trend. This is because of the fact that a static
expectation of next period exchange rate with a value less than unity implies banks in the developing
country ﬁnds it optimal to borrow from the international market. The ever increasing demand for
loans raises the interest rate over time. In the process the role of dynamic terms of trade operates
via (2.12). If there is an adverse supply shock in the foreign exchange market (due to, say a deﬁcit
in the balance of trade) then the second component on the L.H.S. of (2.12) has to fall to match
the given value on the R.H.S. This interacts with the R.H.S. of (2.10) to achieve equilibrium in
the foreign exchange market. The eﬀect of current period exchange rate becomes more pronounced
because the expectation of next period exchange rate is static - invariant to current information set
about the future. If the expectation formation is in tune with rational expectations hypothesis then
current exchange rate also reﬂects expected exchange rate provided the foreign exchange market
eﬃcient. In such a situation dynamic terms of trade eﬀect may not be as strong as observed here.
Eventually in the ﬁnal equilibrium interest rate eﬀect in each period dominates so that aggregate
capital inﬂow to the developing country hovers around a stationary path. The ﬂuctuation around
the stationary path is governed by the stochastic shocks to net exports. In this model balance of
trade has a dominant role in the determination of the intertemporal path of foreign capital inﬂow.
As a matter of fact the trajectory of capital inﬂow is almost a mirror image of the trajectory of the
exchange rate.

In Table 3 below we provide the mean and variance of the endogenous variables.

The average exchange rate for the period of simulation turns out to be 70.18 units of domestic
currency per unit of the foreign currency and the interest of the international market is 14.47%.
The aggregate equilibrium capital inﬂow to the developing country is 1.6737 units.
It may be
noted that the mean and standard deviation of the endogenous variables reported in Table 3 are
valid for the values of the parameters and initial values of the endogenous variables as in Tables
1 and 2. Any change in one or more of the parameter values generates diﬀerent dynamic paths
of the endogenous variables. Such exercises constitute comparative dynamics of the model. The
new mean and standard deviation of the endogenous variables summarize the change in the series
corresponding to new parameter values.

3 Comparative Dynamic Analysis

We consider changes in some of the parameter values of interest for a better understanding of the
economics of foreign capital inﬂow with emphasis on the primary focus of the model. It may be
noted that for the comparative dynamic analysis we retain the same realised values of shock to
the net export function to make comparisons meaningful. The set of baseline trajectory of the
endogenous variables are plotted in black while the new set are plotted in red throughout this
paper.

3.1 Change in risk perception of the developed country banks, γ

An increase in γ implies that banks in the developed country perceive a higher risk for a given level
of expected proﬁt (see equation (2.2)). In this particular exercise γ is raised from 50 to 70 (the
change is 40%). With the increase in the risk perception a typical bank in the developed country
supplies lower amount of funds in the international market. As a result supply of foreign loans
decreases resulting into increase in the international rate R∗
t . In the ﬁnal equilibrium capital inﬂow
to the developing country decreases and international rate increases for each t.

Figure 6: Eﬀect of increased γ on et (diﬀerence with baseline)

Figs. 4 and 5 depict the new intertemporal trajectory (in red) of the capital inﬂow and the
international interest rate along with the baseline (in black). The trajectory of capital inﬂow
shows a downward shift from the original trajectory while the international interest rate shifts up.
However, there is very little change in the exchange rate. To get a clear picture we plotted the
diﬀerence of the new exchange rate from its baseline for each t and plotted them in Fig. 6. The
trajectory follows a stationary path around zero within a band from -0.001 to 0.0015. There is no
change in the exchange rate because the shock does not aﬀect the net exports and so the balance
of trade which as we argued earlier has a dominating role in the determination of the equilibrium
trajectories.

The averages for the new values of the endogenous variables also conﬁrm this. There is a decrease
in the average foreign capital inﬂow from 1.6737 to 1.5244 which is expected because of the increase
in borrowing rate R∗
t . However, the percentage fall in foreign capital inﬂow 8.92% is more than
the rise in R∗

0.00004. The elasticity of capital inﬂow and interest rate with respect to γ are -0.343 and 0.186
(evaluated at sample averages). Clearly the sensitivity of capital inﬂow to risk perception is much
higher, close to twice than the sensitivity of interest rate.

3.2 Eﬀect of a rise in Et( et+1
et

): Expected depreciation of exchange rate

When banks in the developing country (borrowers in the developing country in general) expect a
depreciation of exchange rate in the future, meaning an increase in the expected exchange rate vis-
`a-vis current rate, Et( et+1
), cost of borrowing (in terms of foreign currency) increases. This change
et
in expectation leads to a decrease in the demand for foreign borrowing which in turn reduces R∗
t
in the ﬁnal equilibrium in each period. Et( et+1
) is raised from 0.92 to 0.95 (3.26% rise), with
et
no change in the other parameter values. Comparing the new intertemporal trajectory with the
baseline trajectory we ﬁnd that the capital inﬂow attains a lower trajectory though the nature of
the time path remains similar to the baseline trajectory.

Comparing the summary statistics reported in Table 5 with the baseline summary statistics reveals
that capital inﬂow decreases by 26.4% and R∗
t decreases by 5.7% on an average. The rate of change
of capital inﬂow with respect to expected exchange rate is -14.73 which is much higher than the rate
of change of interest rate (-0.27). The elasticities of capital inﬂow and interest rate with respect to
expected exchange rate are found to be -11.36 and -1.9. The current exchange rate does not change
to any appreciable level. Diﬀerence of the current exchange rate from the baseline plotted in Fig.
8 shows that the range of variation is non- signiﬁcant (from −0.011 to 0.002). The behaviour of
the endogenous variables as depicted in the ﬁgures are also conﬁrm from the respective averages
over the periods provided in Table 5.

3.3 Decrease in the productivity of the domestic sector of the developing coun-

try, Et(η)

When there is a decrease in the productivity of the domestic sector of the developing country,
Et(ηt), proﬁt in the production sector falls which in turn leads to decreased demand for foreign
loans by the developing countries. We conduct this exercise by reducing Et(ηt) reduced from 0.96
to 0.93 (roughly 3.12% decrease). Given below the plots of endogenous variables with the new
Et(ηt).

Figure 12: Eﬀect of a lower Et(η) on et (in diﬀerence)

From the plot it is seen that the whole trajectory of R∗
t as well as the trajectory of the capital
inﬂow shift below. Comparing the averages with that of the baseline (see Table 6) it is evident that
there is no appreciable change in et while there is fall in both the capital inﬂow and R∗
t by 9.03%
and 2.35% respectively. Thus the fall capital inﬂow is much higher and the fall in R∗
t is a slightly
lower compared to the decrease in productivity, E(ηt). The rate of change of capital inﬂow with
respect to E(ηt) is 5.04 while that for R∗
is 0.11 and the corresponding elasticities are 3.08 and
0.75 respectively.

An increase in the production cost in the developing country has similar eﬀect as the decrease in the
productivity. Such increases can occur due to increase in the price of inputs, wages, interest rate
or price of raw materials. A very common cause of increased production cost arises due to increase
in the prices of imported inputs, particularly crude petroleum and generates balance of payments
crisis. The comparative dynamic analyses considered above show that the international interest
rate is less sensitive to changes in the parameter values than capital inﬂow. This is true whether
the parametric changes occur in the developed country or in the developing country. A comparison
of the elasticities of capital inﬂow and rate of interest in the international loan market with respect
to the parameter values reveals that responsiveness with respect to the expected exchange rate
in the next period far exceeds the responsiveness with respect to the risk perception of loans of
the developed country banks or productivity of the domestic sector of the developing country
(borrowing ﬁrms in the developing country). However, the behaviour of the current exchange rate

17

is governed by the behaviour of the net exports. It is seldom aﬀected by the change in the expected
exchange rate. This is because of the fact that the nature of expectation of the exchange rate is
static, expectation of future exchange rate is invariant with respect to behaviour of the current
exchange rate.

The above analyses can be useful for an analysis of the potential of ﬁnancial crisis in this model.
All the above three cases have the potential for generating ﬁnancial crisis when foreign capital
inﬂow drops to a very low level; in the extreme case it can hit the horizontal axis as in Figs. 4
and 10 leading to what can be called sudden stop a la Calvo (1998). As a matter of fact in the
case of a sudden stop it is very diﬃcult for the borrowing country to come back to its original
position. However, the crisis, in this model does not occur because of imperfection in the loan
market resulting into binding ﬁnance constraints for ﬁrms which becomes profound with goods
price rigidity as in Aghion et al(2000).
It is not the fallout of classic problem of moral hazard
or adverse selection (Krugman, 1998). Nor it is (mis)information issue that has been ascribed
very important role in the sense of herd behaviour discussed by Kindleberger (1978) and formally
modelled by Banerjee (1992).

We have shown that a favourable foreign capital inﬂow can turn into a crisis even when macroe-
conomic fundamentals are good. In view of the such vulnerability of unrestricted capital ﬂow to
ﬁnancial crisis eminent economists such as Bhagwati (1998), Ostroy et al (2010), Rodrick (1998)
have suggested policy to tax capital out ﬂow, such as Tobin type tax in general even when macroe-
conomic fundamentals show good performance and Sen (2006) in particular has argued against full
capital account convertibility for the Indian economy.

4 Conclusion

The study addresses the economics of foreign capital inﬂow based on trade theoretic explanation
operating via terms of trade eﬀect in a dynamic context. The model is set up and solved in a two
country group framework - developing or borrowing group and developed or lending group. Each
individual agent in both the country groups chooses her respective loan portfolio for each period by
optimization of an intertemporal objective function of mean-variance variety. The equilibrium in the
loan market together with the foreign exchange market solves the endogenous variables of the model
using numerical methods. Net exports which constitutes the supply side of the foreign exchange
market dominates intertemporal trajectory of endogenous variables. Simulation exercises are then
conducted to derive comparative dynamic results to assess the impact of shocks to parameters of
the model on the intertemporal trajectory of the endogenous variables, viz. international interest
rate, foreign capital inﬂow and exchange rate.

Given the structure of the model a change in the risk perception in the developed country reduces
capital inﬂow to the developing country group as a whole. An increase in the expected exchange
rate vis-`a-vis the current exchange rate raises the eﬀective cost of foreign loans leading to a decrease
in demand which in the ﬁnal equilibrium also reduces the international interest rate. A fall in the

18

productivity in the domestic sector of the developing country leads to a fall in foreign capital inﬂow
and a fall in the international interest rate. However, the responsiveness with respect to expected
exchange rate vis-`a-vis current exchange rate is much more compared to the other comparative
dynamic analyses considered here.

The paper can be extended in several directions. A restrictive assumption of the model is static
expectation of exchange rate. An extension with endogenous determination of expected exchange
rate is capable to add richer dynamics to the model. Another interesting extension could be the
endogeneity of risk of default that is dependent on the outstanding borrowing of the developing
countries. Finally, a multi country extension within the borrowing country group can be undertaken
to show the contagion eﬀect when a shock originating in one of the borrowing countries spreads to
the other members of the group.

then the developed country has no incentive to lend the developing country.8 This is expected as
the developed country banks lend only when the expected return from the loan is greater than the

(5.13)

For the next part, note the R.H.S. of (5.2) is a function of µ∗, say f (µ∗). To ﬁnd the existence of
a solution µ∗, it suﬃces to show that f (0) and f (1) has opposite sign.

Now

f (0) = −Ft(1 + RD

where b0 and c0 are the value of b and c when µ∗ = 0. Thus, c0 = 0 and

b0 =

Thus,

f (0) = −Ft(1 + RD

is positive or negative depending on Ft is positive or negative, as Zt > 0 and b0 > 0. It is expected
that Ft is positive otherwise the developed country block would not lend. As we are interested only
in the case when the developed country block is the lending group, Ft > 0 for all t. Thus f (0) > 0.

Next we check the value of f (1), as

f (1) = −Ft(1 + RD

where b1 and c1 and Ft+1,1 are the values of corresponding equation at µ∗ = 1. Note, c1 < 0 from
(5.8) Thus for large values of γ, f (1) < 0. Hence the proof of existence of µ∗ ∈ (0, 1).

8For some parametric conﬁgurations, existence of root in [0,1] is not guaranteed and this has an economic inter-
pretation. (1 − µt)∗ < 0 ⇒ excessive lending, which is equivalent to raising new domestic deposits and lending all
the accumulated funds along with the new deposits to the foreign country banks.

The structure of the utility function of the bank of the developing country is such that its value
coeﬃcient z is dependent only on the exogenous variables unlike the coeﬃcient of the value function
for the utility of a typical bank in the developed country. The other coeﬃcient y is linear in λ
enabling us to write λ as a function of R∗

t as follows.

and implies g(0) is an increasing (and linear) function of β. Also, g(1) = h + g(0) where h ≥ 0 and
clearly a linear increasing function of β as well. Thus, both g(0) and g(1) are linear and increasing
function of β and g(1) has higher slope than that of g(0). Since for β = 0 both g(0) = −At = g(1),

g(1) would cross the X-axis ahead of g(0) as beta increases. Let us call the crossing point of X-
axis for g(1) as β1 and that of g(0) as β0 which is bigger than β1. Therefore for any β ∈ (β1, β0),
t ∈ (0, 1). Hence we get the existence result.
g(1) > 0 and g(0) < 0. Hence for those β there exists λ∗

developing country bank takes foreign loan only when the expected currency adjusted international

Distribution of t, ηt
, ηt are taken as two point random variables. Given two points and expectation, their variance
is ﬁxed. Similarly given two points and variance, their expectation is ﬁxed. So, for a two point
distribution expectation and variance cannot be arbitrarily chosen given two points. Here ηt take
values {1, η} and η is chosen in such a way to match expectation and variance and so do for
Et(t). ηt is simulated randomly from a distribution which satisﬁes the given expectation variance
property. Since V (ηt) is very low, Et(ηt) can be used as a random number simulator from the
unknown distribution.
