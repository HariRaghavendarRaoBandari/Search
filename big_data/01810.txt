Ultra-cold atom-ion mixtures [1, 2] are gaining
increasing interest due to their potential applica-
tions in quantum chemistry [3], quantum comput-
ing [4, 5] and many-body physics [6]. The polar-
ization potential between atoms and ions scales as
r−4 and extends to 100’s of nm. This long length-
scale interaction can form macroscopic objects [7]
while exhibiting quantum features such as Fes-
hbach [8, 9] and shape resonances [10] at suﬃ-
ciently low temperatures. So far, reaching the
quantum regime of atom-ion interaction has been
impeded by the ion’s excess micromotion (EMM)
which sets a scale for the steady-state energy
[2, 11, 12]. In this work, we studied the dynamics
of a ground-state cooled ion with negligible EMM
during few, to many, Langevin (spiraling) colli-
sions with ultra-cold atoms. We measured the
energy distribution of the ion using both coherent
(Rabi) [13] and non-coherent (photon scattering)
[14] spectroscopy. We observed a clear deviation
from a Maxwell-Boltzmann thermal distribution
to a Tsallis energy distribution [15] characterized
by a power-law tail of high energies [16]. Un-
like previous experiments, here the energy scale
of atom-ion interactions is not determined by ei-
ther the atomic cloud temperature or the EMM
energy. In fact, it is determined by the force the
atom exerts on the ion during a collision which
is then ampliﬁed by the trap dynamics [17]. This
eﬀect is intrinsic to ion Paul traps and sets the
lower bound of atom-ion steady-state interaction
energy in these systems. We also show that, even
though the ion’s mean energy diverges due to the
long tail of the energy distribution, the energy
transfer per collision is relatively small. There-
fore, despite the fact that our system is eventu-
ally driven out of the ultra-cold regime, we are,
in principle, capable of studying quantum eﬀects
by limiting the interaction time to the ﬁrst few
collisions.

Since its ﬁrst inception[18–20], observing quantum me-
chanical phenomena was the holy grail of hybrid atom-ion
research [1, 2, 21–25]. The approach taken was to rely on
the ultra-cold atoms to serve as a refrigerator for the ions
via sympathetic cooling. In each collision the energy is
transferred from the ion’s kinetic energy to the colliding
atom which is then typically lost from the shallow atom
trap keeping the atomic bath cold. Unfortunately, it was
soon realized that the ion thermalizes with the residual
EMM in the Paul trap which couples to its harmonic

secular motion by collisions with the atoms [2, 11, 12].

The interplay between micromotion heating and sym-
pathetic cooling has been known for a long time [26]. In
particular, it was theoretically shown that sympathetic
cooling of the ion results in a non-thermal energy dis-
tribution with a power-law tail, the magnitude of which
depends on the atom-ion mass ratio and trap parame-
ters [11, 16, 27]. The position dependent micromotion
inherent to Paul traps ampliﬁes the energy imparted to
the ion in a single collision. In the process of consecutive
collisions this potentially heats the ion to energies be-
yond the Maxwell-Boltzmann bounds. This phenomenon
is closely related, among other examples, to anomalous
diﬀusion in optical lattices [28] and is well described by
non-Maxwellian statistics which was ﬁrst introduced by
Tsallis [15]. If the ion is suﬃciently lighter than the cool-
ing atoms its mean energy diverges and collisions even-
tually result in the loss of the ion from the trap.

In stable mixtures the mean steady-state energy of the
ion is proportional, albeit with potentially a large ampli-
ﬁcation factor, to the energy of a single collision at the
trap center which is determined by, e.g., residual EMM
[11] or the temperature of the atoms [27]. It is therefore
interesting to ask what would determine the steady state
temperature and ion dynamics when the ion is initial-
ized in the ground state of the trap and both EMM and
atom temperature are negligible? Recently, the energy
involved in a single collision was calculated to be deter-
mined by the atom-ion attraction during collision which
pulls the ion away from the trap minimum into ﬁnite RF
regions of the trap [17]. Furthermore, the quantum dy-
namics of ultra-cold atom-ion collisions was calculated
and has shown signiﬁcant heating that depends on the
trap parameters used [29].

In this experiment, we studied the dynamics of an ion,
initialized in the ground-state of all trap modes, dur-
ing collisions with ultra-cold atoms and negligible EMM,
thus investigating the fundamental limits to the temper-
ature of atom-ion mixtures in Paul traps. The species
we used are 87Rb atoms and 88Sr+ ion which have al-
most equal masses. This choice of masses ampliﬁes the
deviation from Maxwell-Boltzmann to a power-law en-
ergy distribution which was not observed in experiments
before. Our results show a clear deviation from Maxwell-
Boltzmann to Tsallis energy distribution with a pro-
nounced power-law tail. Moreover, the heating mecha-
nism in our system is indeed seeded by the puling of the
ion from the trap center. Our observations are with good
agreement with molecular dynamics simulations.

V (r) = −C4/2r4. Here, r is the atom-ion separation
and C4, which is proportional to the polarizability of
the atom, characterizes the interaction strength. Clas-
sically, atom-ion collisions are divided into glancing and
Langevin (spiraling) collisions by the scattering impact

parameter bc =
ergy. Glancing collisions, which have a larger impact pa-
rameter than bc, are purely elastic and involve only very
small momentum transfer.
In contrast, Langevin colli-
sions involve large momentum transfer and can also lead
to inelastic processes such as spin exchange or relaxation
[30], charge exchange [3], molecule formation [22] and
three-body recombination [31]. While the loss of atoms
from the trap in the presence of an ion is dominated
by glancing collisions [11] we expect the heating of the
ion to be dominated by the large momentum transfer of
µ nat,
Langevin collisions, the rate of which, ΓL = 2π
is energy independent. For our experimental parameters
(reduced mass µ = matmion

density nat ≈ 1.2 · 1012 cm−3) the mean time between
Langevin collisions is tL = 1/ΓL = 0.35 ms.

During collisions the ion’s energy distribution develops
a power-law tail [11, 16, 27, 32]. We use the Tsallis distri-
bution which is a generalization of the thermal Maxwell-
Boltzmann distribution to ﬁt both our simulation and
experiment results [15],

Here, An = (n−3)(n−2)(n−1)
is a normalization factor, kB

and n are parameters of the distribution.
In the liter-
ature, Tsallis functions are usually deﬁned with the q-
parameter, qT . Here we deﬁne n = 1
qT−1 such that in
the limit of n→∞ (qT→1) the distribution in Eq. 1 be-
comes a thermal distribution of a 3D harmonic oscillator:
P (E) ∝ E2e−E/kBT. For smaller n-values the distribu-
tion exhibits power-law asymptotic tail: P (E) ∼ E2−n.
It is also important to notice that the distribution is non-
normalizable for n≤3 and the distribution mean diverges
for n≤4.
Our experiment, shown schematically in Fig 1, is de-
signed to overlap ultra-cold 87Rb atoms (∼5 µK) trapped
in a cross dipole trap with ground-state cooled 88Sr+
ion (¯n<0.1 in all three modes of motion) trapped in a
linear segmented Paul trap. The ion’s EMM is rou-
tinely evaluated and compensated (EEMM<0.5 mK·kB)

sition. Using optical-pumping we initialize the ion in

FIG. 1: Experimental setup. a) Our apparatus is com-
posed of two vacuum chambers, connected with a thin tube.
In the top chamber, we collect atoms and cool them to a tem-
perature of several µK using standard magneto-optical trap-
ping and evaporative cooling in a CO2 dipole trap. We then
transfer the atoms to the bottom chamber using a 1-D moving
optical lattice where they are re-trapped in a crossed dipole
trap and overlapped with a single ground-state cooled ion.

We prepare the ion in the 5s2S1/2
Zeeman ground-state. We use a narrow line-width laser res-
onant with the S1/2 → D5/2 quadrupole transition at 674nm
to perform coherent Rabi thermometry. We use a 422nm
laser resonant with the S1/2 → P1/2 dipole transition together
with a 1092nm re-pump on the D3/2 → P1/2 transition for
state-selective ﬂuorescence and Doppler re-cooling thermom-

mental details see Methods). We typically overlap 20,000
atoms with the ion for a variable interaction time rang-
ing from 0.5 ms to several seconds, at the end of which
the atoms are released from the dipole trap. Following
interaction we measure the ion’s energy. Diﬀerent inter-
action times lead to diﬀerent ion energies and therefore
two diﬀerent ion-thermometry methods were used. Fol-
lowing short interaction times and with energies up to
few mK, carrier Rabi spectroscopy [13] of the narrow
electric quadrupole transition was used. For longer in-
teraction times, we used the Doppler re-cooling (DRC)
method [14] on a strong dipole allowed transition.

Each experimental run, typically lasting few seconds
of atom cloud preparation, transport and atom-ion in-
teraction, ends with ion interrogation. Since atom-ion
collisions lead to spin de-polarization [30, 33], we used a
short optical pumping (OP) pulse to transfer the popula-
tion back to the 5s2S1/2
ing the Rabi spectroscopy. Immediately after, we shine
a pulse of light resonant with the 5s2S1/2

The experimental results for atom-ion interaction
times lasting up to 6.5ms, which correspond to up to
20 Langevin collisions on average, are shown in ﬁgures
2a-f. We scanned the pulse duration, tR, and ﬁtted the
measured shelving probability (shown by the ﬁlled cir-
cles) to Eq. 2 using the distribution of Eq. 1 with two
ﬁt parameters: T and n (the best ﬁt is shown by solid
lines). As seen, the ion heats up due to collisions with the
atoms, and as it does, the contrast of the ﬂopping curve
decays due to incoherent sum of contributions from dif-
ferent motional states. As seen in Fig. 2h, the energy
distribution changes from thermal (n(cid:29)1) to a power-law
distribution with n=3.9(1) over the course of several col-
lisions. A comparison to the best ﬁtted thermal distri-
bution is shown by the dashed lines in ﬁgures 2a-f. As
seen, a thermal distribution failed to faithfully explain
our observations.

Once the energy distribution of the ion has been estab-
lished, we examine the rate of ion heating as a function
of the interaction time. Since the ion’s mean energy is
not deﬁned for this power-law we characterize the distri-
bution using the most probable energy, Emode,

which we will hereafter refer to as the ion’s temperature.
Note that for thermal distribution TIon = T. The tem-
perature of the ion is shown by the ﬁlled circles in Fig.
2g. The heating is linear with a rate of 219(40) µK
ms which
corresponds to, on average, 68(18) µK per collision. Af-
ter 6.5ms the ion’s temperature exceeds 2mK and the
carrier thermometry losses sensitivity. At this point the
ion has already heated up signiﬁcantly beyond its EMM
energy.

To gain better understanding of the heating dynamics,
we compare our results to a molecular-dynamics simula-
tion (see Methods). First, we use a simulation similar
to Ref.
[11] which only takes into account hard-sphere

3

collisions and therefore is only aﬀected by EMM and the
temperature of the atoms (black dots in Fig. 2g). Here,
the ion equilibrates with the residual EMM energy (set to
0.5mK·kB in the simulation). The resulting ion’s energy
distribution is also power-law with n=3.83. However, the
ion’s steady-state temperature of ∼0.35 mK is almost or-
der of magnitude smaller than the last data point of our
experimental results which shows no steady-state behav-
ior in the measured regime. As a second step, we add to
our simulation the polarization force between the atom
and ion and calculate the particles trajectories in a sim-
ilar fashion to Ref.
[17] (empty circles in Fig. 2g). In
this case, the simulation faithfully reproduces our exper-
imental results. The ion’s temperature increases linearly
at the experimental rate to 2mK and the power-law in
the simulation also saturates to n=3.8. As seen, in the
absence of EMM and negligible atomic temperature, the
ion dynamics is dominated by the reaction of the polar-
ization potential on the ion, pulling it away from the trap
center into ﬁnite RF-regions in the trap. This is the ﬁrst
observation of atom-ion collision dynamics which is not
determined by the atom’s temperature or the ion’s EMM.
The heating rates measured using Carrier Rabi spec-
troscopy of the narrow line-width transition show a linear
increase in temperature throughout the entire measure-
ment range (few mK). To measure the ion’s temperature
after longer interaction times we use DRC thermome-
try, which is sensitive from ∼10mK to few Kelvin [34].
We perform DRC using a laser slightly red-detuned (-
1.8 MHz) from the 5s2S1/2 → 5p2P1/2 dipole transi-
tion and a re-pump red-detuned (-16.5 MHz) from the
4d2D3/2 → 5p2P1/2 transition (see Fig. 1c). In the re-
cooling analysis we take into account the 8-levels involved
in the DRC, cooling of all the ion modes, radiation pres-
sure, eﬀects of ion micromotion and the non-thermal en-
ergy distribution of the ion [35].

To better understand the role of EMM on our ion’s
steady-state temperature, we scan the EMM energy by
almost three orders of magnitude from 0.5 to 200 mK·kB.
We overlap the atoms with the ion for 200 ms during
which more than 400 Langevin collisions occur on aver-
age. After interaction, we detect the time-resolved ﬂu-
orescence signal with 50 µs binning and up to 50 ms.
As the ion cools during detection, the ﬂuorescence sig-
nal increases. We detect on average four photons in
each bin. We repeat the experiment 350 times to im-
prove our signal-to-noise ratio. We ﬁt the ﬂuorescence
curve to our DRC model using the power-law distribu-
tion (Eq. 1) with a single ﬁt parameter, T. The power-
law parameter, n, is ﬁxed to the value extracted from
a simulation which changes from n=3.9-4.2 between low
and high EMM energies due to the atomic cloud ﬁnite
size. The results are shown in Fig. 3. We observe a lin-
ear dependence of the ion’s temperature with the EMM
energy, TIon = 0.575(19)EEMM/kB + 6.8(2.4) mK. The
scaling predicted from a simulation of hard-sphere colli-

sions only, is TIon = 0.656EEMM/kB which has a slightly
higher slope, probably due to inaccuracies in DRC mod-
eling and atomic cloud size uncertainties. However, the
main diﬀerence between the simulation and the experi-
ment is the steady-state temperature when EMM is com-
pensated. When EMM is compensated below 0.5 mk·kB,
a simulation of hard-sphere collisions predicts a steady
state temperature of similar magnitude (as shown in Fig.
3 by the crossing of the simulation data (black dots) in
the origin), whereas our data indicates a steady-state
temperature at least an order of magnitude higher. This
is a second indication for dynamics beyond simple hard-
sphere collisions. In the ﬁgure inset we show that even
the Doppler re-cooling signal is sensitive, at-least quali-
tatively, to the deviation of the ion’s energy distribution
from thermal (best ﬁt shown by dashed line) to power-
law (similarly by solid line). Here however, DRC is not
sensitive enough to extract the exact power-law from the
experimental data.

To study the approach to steady state in the presence
of EMM we measured the ion’s temperature using DRC
after short interaction times. The ion’s temperature, as
it approaches steady-state, in the presence of EMM with
100 mK·kB average kinetic energy is plotted in Fig. 4

(magenta diamonds). From an exponential ﬁt, we extract
a time-scale (1/e) of 3.6(2.8) collisions to reach steady-
state. We compare this collision time-scale with a sim-
ulation for both high (100 mK·kB as in the experiment)
and low (12 mK·kB) EMM energy (black dots) which
yields a time-scale (1/e) of 7.7 collisions to reach steady-
state for both. These time-scales are signature of EMM
dominated collisions where the ion quickly equilibrates
with the EMM. In the absence of EMM, we observe a
slow approach to steady state (74(14) collisions) which is
extracted from the heating rate (68(18) µK
Coll. ) measured
using Rabi spectroscopy (Fig. 2g) and the steady-state
(6.8(2.4) mK) measured using DRC (Fig. 3). This ob-
servation is the third indication for diﬀerent dynamics in
the absence of EMM.

To conclude, we used two complementary techniques

thermal distribution was emphasized by the use of an ion-
atom mixture of nearly equal-mass species. Our system
can be further used to study non-extensive thermody-
namics. We have seen that, in the regime of negligible
EMM, ion heating is dominated by the pulling of the ion
from the trap center by the atom. Although the steady-
state temperature of our ion is far from the quantum
regime, the heating rate is suﬃciently slow to enable us
to study ultra-cold interactions by investigating the ﬁrst
few collisions.

107 87Rb atoms in a magneto-optical-trap. The atoms
are optically pumped to the F=1 hyperﬁne level and
then loaded into a single-beam CO2 (10 µm wavelength)
trap where they are evaporatively cooled to temperature
of ∼5 µK. At this stage, the atoms are loaded into a
1-D optical lattice (1064 nm YAG laser) which is used
to transport the atoms to the bottom chamber. We
move the atoms in the lattice by changing the relative
frequency of the lattice beams by up to 3 MHz in 0.3
sec.
In the bottom chamber 20,000 atoms are loaded
from the optical lattice into a crossed dipole trap po-
sitioned 60 µm above the ion. We have veriﬁed that
at this point the atoms are still in the F=1 hyperﬁne
level. This is important due to the large hyperﬁne en-
ergy (325 mK) which is coupled to the ion via spin de-
polarization collision. At the bottom chamber a single

the EMM energy in the high-EMM experiments. While
the atoms are held 60 µm above the ion, we cool the ion
to its 3D motional ground-state (¯n=0.1,0.09,0.01) and
optically pump the ion to its 5s2S1/2
sub level of its electronic ground state. To overlap the
atoms with the ion, we use a piezoelectric driven mirror
to move the crossed dipole trap onto the ion position in
5 ms. The atoms begin their interaction with the ion
before transport is completed. To account for interac-
tion during transport we add an equivalent extra 0.5 ms
interaction time (already included in the text). At the
end of the transport the atoms oscillate with an ampli-
tude of ∼3 µm for roughly 10ms. This oscillation re-
duce the eﬀective density of the atomic cloud to 86% of
its original value (already included in the text). During
atom-ion interaction all lasers beams are mechanically
shut except for the 1064 nm used for dipole trap. After
the desired interaction time (from ms to few seconds) we
release the atoms from the dipole trap and detect their
number and density using absorption imaging. Immedi-
ately after, we perform Rabi carrier spectroscopy on the
narrow 5s2S1/2 → 4d2D5/2 quadrupole transition com-
bined with Doppler re-cooling spectroscopy on the dipole
allowed 5s2S1/2 → 5p2D3/2 transition.

We perform two type of atom-ion collision simulations.
The simpler type treats only hard-sphere collisions. Here,
the motion of the ion between collisions is calculated
analytically, whereas the collisions with the atoms are
modeled as a stochastic process. The collision is deﬁned
by the resulting scattering angles which are randomly
and uniformly sampled with each collision. Since the
collisions are modeled as instantaneous, only the veloc-
ity of the ion is modiﬁed and determined by energy and
momentum conservation. The time between consecutive
collisions is randomly sampled from exponential distribu-
tion to render a constant rate of Langevin collisions. In
a more involved simulation we treat the ion and atoms
as billiard-balls with a 1/r5 attractive force. Apart from
the mutual interaction, the ion also experiences the trap
RF and DC ﬁelds whereas the atoms are modeled as free
particles. We simulate time dynamics by letting the ion
to interact with multiple atoms consecutively, i.e., one
atom at a time. At t=0 the ion initial conditions are
randomly sampled from a Boltzmann distribution with a
temperature 0.5 mK. at the center of what we deﬁne as
an interaction sphere with a radius of 1.2 µm. Next, a
single Rb atom is generated in a random position on the
surface of the interaction sphere with random velocity
that is sampled from a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution
with temperature of 6 µK. The particles classical trajec-

6

tories are calculated using the Runge-Kutta fourth-order
method until the atom leaves the interaction sphere. In
case of contact interaction due to the particles ﬁnite size
which was set here to 5 nm, a deterministic hard sphere
collision is evaluated after which the time integration con-
tinues. This process is repeated with new atoms being
randomly generated whereas the ion motion is preserved
between the consecutive interaction events. In order to
reduce computation time, we numerically calculate only
events in which the atom-ion minimal separation is be-
low 100 nm. By running the simulation multiple times
we obtain the energy distribution of the ion as a function
of time, which we then compare to our results. Due to
the high energy tail of the energy distribution, as the ion
heats, the interaction sphere of 1.2 um introduces ﬁnite
size eﬀects. Therefore, we could not use this simulation
for ion temperatures well above 2 mk.
