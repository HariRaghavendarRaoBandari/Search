Abstract

We investigated discrete time quantum walks with an arbitrary initial state | Ψ0(θ, φ, ϕ)i = cos θeiφ | 0Li + sin θeiϕ |
0Ri with a U(2) coin U (α, β, γ). We discover that the average position x = max(x) cos(α+γ +φ−ϕ), with coin operator
U (α, π/4, γ) and initial state | Φ0(π/4, φ, ϕ)i = (eiφ | 0Li + eiϕ | 0Ri)√2/2. If we set initial state and coin operator to
| Φ0i(θ, π/2, 0) = i cos θ | 0Li + sin θ | 0Ri) and coin operator U (0, π/4, 0), for α + γ + φ − ϕ = π/2, we discover that
x = − max(x) cos(2θ). Last we verify the result above, and obtain the summarize properties of quantum walks with an
arbitrary state. We get that x(θ, φ, ϕ, α, β, γ, t) = cos 2θ ∗ x|0Li(β, t) + sin 2θ ∗ cos(α + γ + φ − ϕ) ∗ x(|0Li+|0Ri)√2/2(α =
If the average positions x with initial state |0Li and | Ψ0i = (| 0Li+ | 0Ri)√2/2 and coin operator
γ = 0, β, t).
U (0, β, 0) are known, we can get the average position result of quantum walks with an arbitrary initial state and a U(2)
coin operator.

Introduction

Quantum walks (QWs) were ﬁrst introduced in 1993 [1] as the quantum version of classical random walks. QWs can be
divided into discrete time and continuous time [2] QWs. Both continuous time [3] and discrete time [4, 5] QWs can attain
universal quantum computation. QWs have found widespread applications in quantum algorithms[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. In
addition, QWs in graph [12], on a line with a moving boundary [13], with multiple coins [14], decoherent coins [15] or a
SU(2) coin [16, 18] have been discussed.

Here we discuss the average position properties for QWs with an arbitrary state and a U(2) coin.

2 Discrete time quantum walks with an arbitrary initial state and a U(2)

coin operator

The total Hilbert space for discrete time QWs is given by H ≡ HP ⊗ HC, where HP is spanned by the orthonormal states
{|xi, x ∈ Z} and HC is the two-dimensional coin space spanned by two orthonormal states | Li and | Ri.
In this paper, we discuss the QWs with an arbitrary initial state and a U(2) coin operator. The probability distributions
are the same with a U(2) and a SU(2) coin operator[18]. Here we use a SU(2) matrix:

After t steps QWs, the ﬁnal state can be written as:

Using Eq. 12, we can get that x(π/4, φ, ϕ, α, π/4, γ, t) = cos(α + γ + φ − ϕ) ∗ x√2(|0Li+|0Ri)/2(α = γ = 0, β, t), this
The same as above, we can get that x(θ, π/2, 0, 0, β, 0, t) = cos 2θ ∗ x|0Li(β, t), this equation proves the result in Fig.

If we set the initial state to |Φ0(π/4, 0, π/2)i = 1/√2(|0Li+i|0Ri), using Eq. 12 we can get that x(π/4, 0, π/2, α, β, γ, t) =
For any α + γ + φ − ϕ = 0 , x(θ = π/4, α + γ + φ − ϕ = 0, β, t) = x(π/4, 0, 0, 0, β, 0, t).
Eq. 12 indicates the change rule of the average position in QWs with the parameters θ, φ, ϕ, α and γ. If we know

average positions x with coin operator U (0, β, 0), while the initial states are |0Li and
average position result for an arbitrary state using Eq. 12.

5 Conclusions

In this paper, we discussed the average position property in QWs with an arbitrary initial state | Ψ0i(θ, φ, ϕ) = cos θeiφ |
0Li+ sin θeiϕ | 0Ri and a U (2) = U (α, β, γ) coin operator. Firstly, we set the coin operator and initial state to U (0, π/4, 0)
and | Φ0(π/4, φ, ϕ)i respectively, we get that x = max(x) cos(φ − ϕ). Secondly, if we left the initial state unchanged, and
set the coin operator to U (α, π/4, γ), we get that x = max(x) cos(α + γ + φ − ϕ). Thirdly, we set the coin operator and
initial state to U (0, π/4, 0) and | Φ0(θ, π/2, 0)i respectively, we get that x = − max(x) cos(2θ). Lastly, we poof the above
result in mathematics, we get that the average position x(θ, φ, ϕ, α, β, γ, t) = cos 2θx|0Li(β, t) + sin 2θ ∗ cos(α + γ + φ −
ϕ)x√2(|0Li+|0Ri)/2(α = γ = 0, β, t). If we know average positions x with coin operator U (0, β, 0), while the initial states
√2
are |0Li and | Ψ0i =
2 (| 0Li+ | 0Ri), we can get the average position result of quantum walks for an arbitrary state
and a U(2) coin operator.
