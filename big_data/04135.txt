A hallmark of the iron-based superconductors is the strong coupling between magnetic,
structural and electronic degrees of freedom1, 2. However, a universal picture of the nor-
mal state properties of these compounds has been confounded by recent investigations of
FeSe where the nematic (structural) and magnetic transitions appear to be decoupled. Here,
using synchrotron-based high-energy x-ray diffraction and time-domain M¨ossbauer spec-
troscopy, we show that nematicity and magnetism in FeSe under applied pressure are indeed
strongly coupled. Distinct structural and magnetic transitions are observed for pressures,
1.0 GPa . p . 1.7 GPa, which merge into a single ﬁrst-order phase line for p & 1.7 GPa,
reminiscent of what has been observed, both experimentally and theoretically, for the evo-
3. Our results
lution of these transitions in the prototypical doped system, Ba(Fe1−xCox)2As2
support a spin-driven mechanism for nematic order in FeSe and provide an important step
towards a universal description of the normal state properties of the iron-based supercon-
ductors.

Unconventional superconductivity (SC) is generally believed to be mediated by ﬂuctuations
associated with ordering (magnetic, orbital or charge) found in the normal state of the material1, 2.
For the high-temperature iron-based superconductors, a leading candidate is the ubiquitous stripe-
like antiferromagnetic (AFM) ﬂuctuations associated with the magnetic ordering in the normal
state.
In some scenarios, these same spin ﬂuctuations also lead to ”nematic” electronic order,
identiﬁed by a tetragonal-to-orthorhombic (T-OR) structural transition4, 5. However, the magnetic
origin of nematicity has been recently challenged by the unusual properties of FeSe6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

For most iron-based superconductors, including AFe2As2 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba) and RFeAsO (R
= rare earth) and NaFeAs, stripe-like AFM order and nematic order, in the form of a T-OR tran-
sition, occur either simultaneously or in relatively close proximity in temperature, and both can
be tuned by doping or applied pressure. At ambient pressure, FeSe undergoes a T-OR transition

1

at Ts = 90 K, but no ordered AFM state has been observed13. Evidence both for and against the
presence of magnetic order in FeSe under applied pressure has been reported14, 15, 16, 17, and when
magnetic order has been found, the magnetic transition temperature, Tm, was reported to increase
with pressure whereas the structural transition was suppressed18, 19. Furthermore, superconductiv-
ity in FeSe shows a four-fold increase to a transition temperature of Tc = 37 K under pressure14,
20, 18, 19. Taken together, the absence of magnetic order in the pres-
accompanying the increase of Tm
ence of nematic order at ambient pressure, and the opposing evolutions of magnetic and nematic
order with pressure, cast doubt on the notion of a cooperative relation between magnetism and
structure as the origin of the nematic order in FeSe6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

Electrical resistivity measurements under applied pressure provide valuable information re-
garding the existence of phase transitions in the p-T phase space, but microscopic measurements
under pressure are required to fully elucidate the underlying nature of the transitions, the associated
order parameters, and the relationship between the magnetism and structure of FeSe. Although di-
rect microscopic information concerning the magnetic structure is best obtained using neutron
diffraction, several previous measurements have been unsuccessful in detecting the expected small
ordered magnetic moment 17, 19. Therefore, we have employed both high-energy x-ray diffraction
(HE-XRD), on Station 6-ID-D, and time-domain M¨ossbauer spectroscopy through nuclear forward
scattering (NFS), on Station 16-ID-D, at the Advanced Photon Source to study the structural and
magnetic transitions in FeSe under pressure. An important feature of our measurements is that they
were each performed on FeSe single crystals prepared using KCl/AlCl3 chemical vapor transport21,
which were thoroughly characterized in previous studies22, 23. For such high-quality single-crystals,
both Ts and Tm were observed in resistivity measurements, which facilitated a mapping of the phase
diagram18, 22, 19. The batch used for the HE-XRD experiment was characterized with DC magne-
tization and electrical resistivity measurements, and yielded sharp superconducting transitions at
Tc = 8.7 − 8.8 K at ambient pressure. Samples for the NFS experiment were prepared similarly
using 94% isotopically pure 57Fe, and had Tc values between 8.5 - 8.8 K.

The essential results of our study are summarized in Fig. 1. Figure 1a shows that FeSe
undergoes a continuous T-OR transition at ambient pressure at Ts = 90 K. This is observed as a
splitting of the (HH0) Bragg peaks related to the in-plane orthorhombic lattice parameters aOR
and bOR. At an applied pressure of 1.5 GPa (Fig. 1b), this structural transition is suppressed to
Ts = 32 K. However, as the temperature is further lowered there is a subsequent abrupt increase
of the splitting at 19 K. When the pressure is increased to 1.7 GPa only the discontinuous T-
OR transition remains, and Ts increases to 35 K at 3.1 GPa (Fig. 1d). In order to correlate the

2

features observed in the HE-XRD measurements with the evolution of the magnetism in FeSe,
Figs. 1e and f show the NFS (time-domain M¨ossbauer spectra) at two different pressures, 2.5
GPa and 4.0 GPa. The small hyperﬁne ﬁeld associated with magnetic ordering in FeSe is quite
challenging for conventional M¨ossbauer spectroscopy14, but is readily observed in the data from
our NSF measurements. The distinctive feature in these spectra is the minimum at intermediate
delay times, which is determined by a convolution of the magnetic hyperﬁne ﬁeld, quadrupolar
splitting, and effective sample thickness (see Methods Section). Our ﬁts to these spectra ﬁnd that
the shift in the minima at approximately 30 K (p = 2.5 GPa) and 40 K (p = 4 GPa) is attributable
to the presence of a hyperﬁne ﬁeld at these temperatures and pressures, which conﬁrms the onset
of magnetic order in FeSe under pressure.

The order parameters determined from ﬁts to the HE-XRD data, and the evolution of the
hyperﬁne ﬁeld are shown in Fig. 2 and summarized in the p-T diagram of Fig. 3, and provide
insight into the relationship between structure and magnetism in FeSe under pressure. At ambi-
ent pressure, the orthorhombic distortion δ(T ) = (aOR − bOR)/(aOR + bOR) displays a smooth
temperature dependence characteristic of a second-order phase transition (Fig. 2a). Starting from
approximately 1 GPa, however, we observe a small discontinuous increase in δ at approximately
19 K, which is very distinct at p = 1.5 GPa (see the inset of Fig. 2a) and higher applied pressures,
as shown in Fig. 2c. Similar measurements of the canonical BaFe2As2-type iron-based supercon-
ductors clearly established that this discontinuous increase in the orthorhombicity was associated
with strong magnetoelastic coupling and a transition to stripe-like magnetic order3, 24. In Fig. 2b
we show the evolution of the hyperﬁne ﬁeld, Hhf, extracted from ﬁts to the NFS data measured
at applied pressures of 2.5 and 4.0 GPa (Fig. 1e and 1f). The relatively small saturated values
of approximately 2.5 and 3.0 T, respectively, correspond to a small ordered moment on the order
of 0.2 µB/Fe, consistent with the estimates from previous zero-ﬁeld muon spin-resonance (µSR)
experiments17 and the difﬁculty in detecting a magnetic signal in earlier conventional M¨ossbauer
measurements14. We also ﬁnd that TN and the saturation value of Hhf increases with increasing
pressure, consistent with the previous µSR studies16, 17. Although the density of data points is
rather low, Fig. 2b suggests that the NFS spectra at 4.0 GPa is consistent with a strong discontinu-
ous transition, whereas the magnetic transition at 2.5 GPa could be described as weakly ﬁrst-order.

Perhaps most importantly, the HE-XRD data show that the T-OR transition does not vanish
above 1.7 GPa where Ts, as inferred from resistivity measurements, would extrapolate to zero18, 10.
Rather, the abrupt onset of the structural transition and the signiﬁcant coexistence range of the
tetragonal and orthorhombic phases (inset of Fig. 2c) demonstrate that the structural and magnetic

3

transitions merge to a simultaneous ﬁrst-order magneto-structural transition as shown in Fig. 3 and
also found, for example, in the CaFe2As2 parent compound25. Further, our HE-XRD measurements
show that the magnetic order in FeSe breaks the tetragonal symmetry of the lattice in the same
manner as the ubiquitous stripe-type magnetic order in the other iron-based materials. To our
knowledge, no other AFM order observed in iron-based superconductors or magnetic structures
proposed for FeSe26, break the tetragonal symmetry in this speciﬁc way.

The HE-XRD and NFS results for FeSe demonstrate that all features concerning the normal
state structure and magnetism, and their coupling, are very similar to other iron-based superconduc-
tors, and differ only in the details of the temperature and pressure dependencies of the transitions.
These results lend support to a spin-driven mechanism for nematic ordering in FeSe. In Figure 4,
we compare the schematic phase diagrams of BaFe2As2 and FeSe with trends derived from recent
theoretical studies of spin-driven nematicity5. Figure 4a sketches the sequence of structural and
magnetic phase transitions for BaFe2As2 as a function of doping. For Co substitution for Fe in
BaFe2As2 (”electron doping”), the magnetic and structural transitions separate in temperature and
both Ts and Tm decrease with increased substitution3. On the other hand, for ”hole doping”, the
magnetic and structural transitions are concomitant and both transitions decrease in temperature
with increased doping. The p − T diagram for FeSe in Fig. 4b mirrors the compositional phase
diagram described by Fernandes et al5. The character of the phase transitions and their evolution
with applied pressure, determined from our measurements, are consistent with this diagram, with
the only difference being the observed initial decrease of Ts as pressure is lowered, rather than
the displayed decrease. One must, however, consider the relative strengths of the interactions in
such models5, 27 and how these interactions evolve with pressure. In particular, the stiffening of
the elastic constants with increasing pressure can result in a decrease in Ts relative to its value at
ambient pressure. Similarly, an increase in the magnetic interaction, indicated by the increase in
the magnetic ordering temperature and ordered magnetic moment with increasing pressure, can
push Ts, m for the coupled magneto-structural transition to higher temperature.

Methods

HE-XRD measurements were performed on the six-circle diffractometer at station 6-ID-D at the
Advanced Photon Source, using 100.3 keV x-rays and a beam size of 100×100 µm2. A sample
with dimensions 120×120×20 µm3 was loaded into a membrane-driven copper-beryllium dia-
mond anvil cell (DAC). A tungsten gasket with an initial thickness of 120 µm was pre-indented
to a thickness of 70 µm, and a 660 µm hole was laser-drilled to accommodate the sample and

4

pressure calibrants (ruby spheres and silver foil), as shown in Fig. 1e. Helium gas was used as the
pressure transmitting medium and loaded at p = 0.5 GPa. The pressure was initially determined by
the ﬂuorescence lines from ruby spheres at ambient temperature, and, during the diffraction mea-
surements, was determined in-situ by analyzing selected Bragg peaks from the silver foil. The
DAC was mounted on the cold ﬁnger of a He closed-cycle refrigerator and temperature-dependent
measurements were performed between T = 5 and 300 K for various pressures. The pressure was
always changed at temperatures well above 120 K. Extended regions of selected reciprocal lat-
tice planes and the powder diffraction pattern of silver were recorded by a MAR345 image plate
system positioned 1.474 m behind the DAC, as the DAC was rocked by up to ±3.2◦ about two
independent axes perpendicular to the incident x-ray beam. High-resolution diffraction patterns of
selected Bragg reﬂections were also recorded by employing a Pixirad-1 detector positioned 1.397
m behind the DAC while rocking around one of the two axes perpendicular to the x-ray beam. The
images in Fig, 3 show typical examples of diffraction patterns measured using the Pixirad-1 detec-
tor, and demonstrate the excellent mosaic of the single crystal under applied pressure, as evidenced
by the well-split pattern of the (HH0) Bragg peaks (in tetragonal notation) due to the orthorhom-
bic distortion28. The orthorhombic lattice parameters were determined by ﬁtting the Bragg peak
positions after integrating the data over the transverse scattering directions. This procedure was
used for both the data recorded by the Pixirad-1 detector and the data recorded by the MAR345
image plate system.

In NFS, highly monochromatic synchrotron radiation from an electron bunch excites the 57Fe
nuclei and the decay curve is measured as a function of time. In the presence of a hyperﬁne inter-
action that splits the 57Fe energy level, oscillations in the scattered intensity with time (quantum
beats) are observed and can be directly compared with conventional M¨ossbauer spectroscopy29.
NFS spectra were collected at beamline 16-ID-D at the Advanced Photon Source with an incident
energy monochromated to the 57Fe nuclear resonance at 14.4125 keV, with a resolution of 2 meV,
and a cross-section of 35×50 µm2. A 57FeSe single crystal of dimensions 50×50×18 µm3 was
loaded in to a membrane driven copper-beryllium DAC with 600 µm culet anvils, which allowed us
to collect NFS data at p = 2.5 GPa and 4.0 GPa. A non-magnetic Cu-Be gasket was pre-indented to
55 µm, and a hole of diameter 270 µm was laser-drilled to accommodate the sample and pressure
calibrant (ruby spheres). Helium was loaded as the pressure-transmitting medium to enable hy-
drostatic pressure conditions. The DAC was mounted on the cold ﬁnger of a helium-ﬂow cryostat,
which achieved temperatures down to T = 11 K. The intensity of the resonantly scattered photons
in the forward direction, with 153.4 ns separation between the individual bunches, were recorded
by an Avalanche Photo Diode detector. The program CONUSS30 was used to analyze the spectra
and to determine the magnitude of the hyperﬁne ﬁeld. The NFS spectrum at ambient temperature

5

was well modeled without a magnetic hyperﬁne ﬁeld, ﬁtting only the effective sample thickness
and quadrupolar splitting, which yielded a value of 0.20(5) mm/s at p = 0.8 GPa consistent with
earlier reports14. The low-temperature spectra were satisfactorily ﬁt by including a hyperﬁne mag-
netic ﬁeld. The two angles deﬁning the direction of hyperﬁne magnetic ﬁeld with respect to the
incident beam were also determined in addition to the (slightly pressure and temperature depen-
dent) effective thickness of the sample. The values for the quadrupolar splitting were ﬁxed to 0.15
and 0.20 mm/s at p = 2.5 GPa and 4.0 GPa, respectively.
