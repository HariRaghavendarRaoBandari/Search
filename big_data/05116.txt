Abstract

A sequence S = (v1, . . . , vk) of distinct vertices of a graph G is called a legal
sequence if N [vi] \ ∪i−1
j=1N [vj] 6= ∅ for any i. The maximum length of a legal
(dominating) sequence in G is called the Grundy domination number γgr(G) of a
graph G.
It is known that the problem of determining the Grundy domination
number is NP-complete in general, while eﬃcient algorithm exist for trees and
some other classes of graphs [7]. In this paper we ﬁnd an eﬃcient algorithm for the
Grundy domination number of an interval graph. We also show the exact value of
the Grundy domination number of an arbitrary Sierpi´nski graph Sn
p , and present
algorithms to construct the corresponding sequence. These results are obtained
by using the main result of the paper, which are sharp bounds for the Grundy
domination number of a vertex- and edge-removed graph. That is, given a graph
G, e ∈ E(G), and u ∈ V (G), we prove that γgr(G) − 1 ≤ γgr(G − e) ≤ γgr(G) + 1
and γgr(G) − 2 ≤ γgr(G − u) ≤ γgr(G). For each of the bounds there exist graphs,
in which all three possibilities occur for diﬀerent edges, respectively vertices.

Key words: Grundy domination number; Sierpi´nski graphs; interval graphs.

Introduction

Domination is one of the oldest and most studied topics in graph theory, and is known
for many, also real-world applications. Domination theory was comprehensively sur-
veyed in two monographs from almost 20 years ago [14, 15], while a recent mono-
graph [16] focuses only on the total domination, one of the most basic concepts in the
theory. Many other variations of the classical domination number of a graph have been
introduced in years. A very recent and natural one is the so-called Grundy domination

1

number, which somehow describes the worst scenario that can happen when a domi-
nating set is built. More precisely, the Grundy domination number of a graph is the
maximum length of a sequence of its vertices, such that each time a vertex is added it
dominates some vertex that was not dominated by previous vertices in the sequence [7].
(A total version of Grundy domination was introduced in [6].)

One of the focuses in this paper will be on two rather famous classes of graphs,
namely the interval graphs and the Sierpi´nski graphs. The interval graphs, i.e., the
intersection graphs of intervals in the real line, have been introduced by Hajos about
60 years ago; they have many applications in large diversity of areas such as archeology,
artiﬁcial intelligence, economics and planning, cf. [3, 22], and probably most intensively
in mathematical biology, see e.g. [1, 9, 23]. On the other hand, Sierpi´nski graphs were
also introduced in relation with various problems, such as Tower of Hanoi game, physics,
interconnection networks, and topology; see more details in a very recent extensive
survey [21]. The main feature of Sierpi´nski graphs is their fractal-like nature, and can
be considered as a basic discrete version of fractals.

While domination and total domination number are computationally hard problems
in general graphs [12], they can be eﬃciently determined in several classes of graphs, in
particular, in the interval graphs and the Sierpi´nski graphs. An eﬃcient algorithm for
computing the domination number (and some related invariants) in strongly chordal
graphs, which as a subclass contain the interval graphs, was ﬁrst designed by Farber
in the 1980s [10]; Keil soon followed with a linear time algorithm for determining the
total domination number of interval graphs [17]. Even more can be said in the case
of Sierpi´nski graphs, since exact formulas for the domination numbers of these graphs
were established in [20], and more recently also the exact total domination numbers of
arbitrary Sierpi´nski graphs were proven [13].

A motivation for studying dominating sequences was a domination game as intro-
duced in [5]. Two players alternate turns in this game, one player wants to build a
dominating set as quickly as possible, while the other (called Staller) wants to delay
the process. By deﬁnition of legality of moves in the game it follows that the result-
ing number of moves when both players play optimally, called the game domination
number of a graph, is bounded above by the Grundy domination number (in fact, a
legal sequence whose length is the Grundy domination number is obtained when only
Staller plays the game). The domination game has been intensively studied by sev-
eral authors, and a lot of eﬀorts were given to resolve the (still open) 3/5-conjectures
from [18]. In [4] the authors examined the possible changes of the game domination
number under vertex- and edge-removal in a graph, and proposed a classiﬁcation of the
graphs with respect to the corresponding behaviour. (For a very recent paper on game
domination see [19].)

In this paper we describe the behaviour of the Grundy domination number when
an edge or a vertex is removed from a graph, see Section 2. We prove that in any graph

2

p equals pn−1 + p(pn−1

G and u ∈ V (G), the Grundy domination number of G drops by at most 2 when u
is removed from G. Next, if e is an edge of an arbitrary graph G, then the Grundy
domination number of G − e is between one less than the Grundy domination number
of G and one more than that number. Combining the edge-removal bound and the
recursive fractal structure of Sierpi´nski graphs, we prove in Section 3 that the Grundy
domination number of the Sierpi´nski graph Sn
. In addition,
we present two eﬃcient algorithms to construct a Grundy dominating sequence of a
Sierpi´nski graph. The ﬁrst algorithm is optimal, because it uses a recursive formula
that builds only the Sierpi´nski labels of all vertices of the Grundy dominating sequence;
the second algorithm is nice in the sense that the vertices are ordered lexicographically
with respect to their Sierpi´nski labels (hence, one could only follow this order and decide
whether a given vertex can be put in the sequence or not). Finally, in Section 4 we make
use of the vertex-removal formula (in fact, a version of this formula for the removal
of a simplicial vertex) to construct an eﬃcient algorithm for determining a Grundy
domination number (resp. sequence) of an arbitrary interval graph. In the remainder
of this section we present main formal deﬁnitions and notation, used throughout the
paper.

Let S = (v1, . . . , vk) be a sequence of distinct vertices of a graph G. The correspond-
ing set {v1, . . . , vk} of vertices from the sequence S will be denoted by bS. A sequence
S = (v1, . . . , vk), where vi ∈ V (G), is called a legal (closed neigborhood) sequence if, for
each i

N [vi] \ ∪i−1

j=1N [vj] 6= ∅.

(We also say that vi is a legal choice, when the above inequality holds.) If for a legal

sequence S, the set bS is a dominating set of G, then S is called a dominating sequence
of G. Adopting the notation from domination theory, each vertex u ∈ N [vi]\∪i−1
j=1N [vj]
is called a private neighbor of vi with respect to {v1, . . . , vi}. We will also use a more
suggestive term by saying that vi footprints the vertices from N [vi] \ ∪i−1
j=1N [vj], and
that vi is the footprinter of any u ∈ N [vi]\∪i−1
j=1N [vj]. For a dominating sequence S any
vertex in V (G) has a unique footprinter in bS. Thus the function fS : V (G) → bS that
maps each vertex to its footprinter is well deﬁned. Clearly the length k of a dominating
sequence S = (v1, . . . , vk) is bounded from below by the domination number γ(G) of a
graph G. We call the maximum length of a legal dominating sequence in G the Grundy
domination number of a graph G and denote it by γgr(G). The corresponding sequence
is called a Grundy dominating sequence of G or γgr-sequence of G. These concepts were
introduced in [7].

Let S1 = (v1, . . . , vn) and S2 = (u1, . . . , um), n, m ≥ 0, be two sequences. The
concatenation of S1 and S2 is deﬁned as the sequence S1 ⊕ S2 = (v1, . . . , vn, u1, . . . , um).

2 Grundy domination number of subgraphs, obtained by

edge- or vertex-deletion

2.1 Edge-deletion

First consider the subgraphs obtained by the smallest possible atomic change, i.e. dele-
tion of an edge. Unlike in the standard domination, where edge-deletion can only
increase the domination number [14, Chapter 5], the following possibilities appear for
the Grundy domination number.

Theorem 2.1 If G is a graph and e ∈ E(G), then

γgr(G) − 1 ≤ γgr(G − e) ≤ γgr(G) + 1.

Moreover, there exist graphs G such that all values of γgr(G − e) between γgr(G) − 1
and γgr(G) + 1 are realized for diﬀerent edges e ∈ E(G).

Proof. Let S be a Grundy dominating sequence of G, and let e = uv be an edge,

deleted from G. Then, if u, v /∈ bS, S is also a legal sequence of G − e. In fact, the only
case when S is not a legal sequence of G − e is when fS(u) = v and f −1
S (v) = {u}, or
fS(v) = u and f −1
S (u) = {v}. Without loss of generality, we may assume that fS(u) = v
and f −1
S (v) = {u}. Let S ′ be the sequence obtained by removing the vertex v from S.
It is clear that S ′ is a legal sequence in G− e of length |bS|− 1. (If S ′ is not a dominating
sequence, we can append u at the end of it, and obtain a legal dominating sequence of
G − e.) We infer that γgr(G) − 1 ≤ γgr(G − e).

If f −1

For the other inequality consider a Grundy dominating sequence S = (x1, . . . , xk)
If xi is not in NG−e[u] ∪ NG−e[v], then
of G − e, where e = uv is deleted from G.
it is clear that NG[xi] \ ∪i−1
j=1NG[xj] 6= ∅, i.e., xi is a legal choice also in G. Now,
S (xi) 6= {u}, then again xi is a legal choice also
suppose that xi ∈ NG−e[u].
in G. But even if f −1
S (xi) = {u}, and v /∈ {x1, . . . , xi−1}, xi is a legal choice in G.
Thus the only problem with legality of xi is when v = xj for some j < i (note that
we are assuming xi ∈ NG−e[u] and f −1
S (xi) = {u}, that is, the only vertex in G − e
footprinted by xi is u). Now, let S ′ be the sequence obtained from S by removing
xi, i.e., S ′ = (x1, . . . , xi−1, xi+1, . . . xk). From the above it is clear that S ′ is a legal
sequence in G of length γgr(G − e) − 1, hence γgr(G) ≥ |bS ′| = γgr(G − e) − 1.
To see the second part of the theorem, consider the family of graphs Hm,n, obtained
by identifying a vertex of degree 1 of the path Pm, m ≥ 3, with a vertex of the cycle
Cn, n ≥ 3. (The meaning of edges of the cycle and edges of the path in Hm,n should be
clear.) It is easy to see that γgr(Hm,n) = m + n − 3. Now, if e is an edge of the cycle
in Hm,n, then γgr(Gm,n − e) = m + n − 2. If e is the pendant edge of the path in Hm,n,
then γgr(Gm,n − e) = m + n − 3 = γgr(Gm,n). Finally, if e is any other edge (of the
path), then γgr(Gm,n − e) = m + n − 4.
(cid:3)

The following immediate consequence of Theorem 2.1 will be used later.

Corollary 2.2 Let G be a graph, and let G′ be obtained from G, by adding k edges to
G. Then γgr(G) − k ≤ γgr(G′) ≤ γgr(G) + k.

2.2 Vertex-deletion

It is easy to see that γgr(H) ≤ γgr(G), if H is an induced subgraph of G. Indeed, if S
is a Grundy dominating sequence of H, then S is also a sequence in G, and it is clearly
legal also with respect to G. If S is not a dominating sequence in G, one can add some
vertices in a legal way at the end of S to make it a dominating sequence of G. Hence
γgr(G) ≥ γgr(H), and so the graph property of having the Grundy domination number
bounded from above by a constant belongs to hereditary properties.

Let us focus on the action of vertex deletion in a graph G. By the observation in
the previous paragraph, the Grundy domination number cannot increase when a vertex
is removed. The following result speciﬁes how much it can decrease.

Theorem 2.3 If G is a graph and u ∈ V (G), then

γgr(G) − 2 ≤ γgr(G − u) ≤ γgr(G).

Moreover, there exist graphs G such that all values of γgr(G − u) between γgr(G) − 2
and γgr(G) are realized for diﬀerent vertices u ∈ V (G).

Proof. The bound γgr(G − u) ≤ γgr(G) immediately follows from the fact that the
Grundy domination number of an induced subgraph H of G is not greater than that
of G.

For bounding γgr(G − u) from below, let S be a Grundy dominating sequence in G,
and let v be the vertex in S that footprints u, i.e., v = fS(u). Consider the sequence S ′
obtained from S by removing v, and, if u ∈ bS, also removing u. We claim that S ′ is a

legal sequence in G − u. Indeed, since v and u are not in S ′, we derive that each vertex
x from S ′ in G − u footprints all the vertices that are footprinted by x with respect
to S in G (while x with respect to S ′ in G − u could also footprint some additional
vertices in NG(u) ∪ NG[v]). Since a legal sequence S ′ can be completed to a dominating
sequence of G − u, we get γgr(G) − 2 ≤ |bS ′| ≤ γgr(G − u).
To see the second part of the theorem, consider the family of graphs Gm,n, obtained
by identifying a vertex of degree 1 of the path Pm, m ≥ 4, with a vertex of the complete
graph Kn, n ≥ 3. It is clear that γgr(Gm,n) = m. Now, if u is the vertex of degree 1
in Gm,n or its neighbor or the identiﬁed vertex, then γgr(Gm,n − u) = m − 1. If u is a
vertex of the complete graph (and not the identiﬁed vertex), then γgr(Gm,n − u) = m.
Finally, if u is any other vertex (in the path), then γgr(Gm,n − u) = m − 2.
(cid:3)

Better bounds can be obtained for special type of vertices, namely for twin and
simplicial vertices, whose deﬁnition we recall now. A vertex v ∈ V (G) is a simplicial
vertex of a graph G, if N (v) induces a complete graph. Two vertices u and v in G
are called twins if N [u] = N [v]. A vertex v ∈ V is called a twin vertex if there exists
u ∈ V , such that u and v are twins. The following result will be applied later (the
second statement was known already in [7]).

Proposition 2.4 Let G be a graph and u ∈ V (G).

(i) If u is a simplicial vertex, then γgr(G − u) ≥ γgr(G) − 1.

(ii) If u is a twin vertex, then γgr(G − u) = γgr(G).

Proof.

(i) Let S be a Grundy dominating sequence in G, u a simplicial vertex, and

let fS(u) = v. If u /∈ bS, then the sequence obtained from S by removing v is a legal
sequence in G − u, implying γgr(G − u) ≥ γgr(G) − 1. Suppose now that u ∈ bS. Then
u footprints one vertex from the clique N [u]. Thus u is in S before any x ∈ N (u) ∩ bS
which means that fS(u) = u. Thus the sequence obtained from S by removing u is a
legal sequence in G − u, implying γgr(G − u) ≥ γgr(G) − 1.

(ii) Let v be a twin of u and let S be a Grundy dominating sequence in G. If u /∈ bS,
then S is a legal sequence of G − u, implying γgr(G − u) ≥ γgr(G). Suppose now that
u ∈ bS. Then v /∈ bS and the sequence S ′ obtained from S by replacing u with v is a
Grundy dominating sequence in G not containing u. Hence also in this case we have
γgr(G − u) ≥ γgr(G). Combining this with Theorem 2.3 we obtain γgr(G − u) = γgr(G).

Set [n] = {1, 2, . . . , n} and [n]0 = {0, 1, . . . , n − 1}. The Sierpi´nski graph Sn
is deﬁned on the vertex set [p]n
(v1, v2, . . . , vn) being adjacent if and only if there exists an h ∈ [n] such that

Clearly h0ni is the ﬁrst vertex in An

vertex in the sequence. To see that, we have to expand the equation to the bottom of
recursion. Then each vertex in the sequence comes from some iA1
p, where
i ∈ [p]0 and 1 < l ≤ n. If a vertex comes from iA1
p, then its last bit is 0. The only
extreme vertex with the last bit 0 is h0ni. If a vertex is in some iBl
p, then it is not an
extreme vertex in An
p , since its l-th bit is i and its last (l − 1) bits are greater then i.
So the only extreme vertex in An

p, its form is v = hx1x2 . . . xn−labl−1i, where a < b and
v comes from a sequence iBl

The proof of Theorem 3.1 also yields the construction of a Grundy dominating
sequence of Sn
p . In the construction we are building the Grundy dominating sequence
by concatenating smaller sequences and by concatenating one bit to the left of every
vertex in the sequence. Thus the time complexity of the construction is the same as
the length of the Grundy dominating sequence multiplied by n, since each vertex is
labelled by n bits. We derive that the time complexity of the construction is O(npn).
In addition, the algorithm constructs along the way all Grundy dominating sequences
of Sℓ
p, for ℓ ≤ n. Since the complexity of the algorithm (which simply builds the
sequence An
p that form a Grundy
dominating sequence, we infer that this complexity is best possible.

There exists an alternative (and easier) construction of a γgr-sequence of Sn

p , of
which construction time complexity is slightly worse than above, since we are going
through all vertices in Sn
p . Nevertheless, let us present also this construction, because
the vertices in the sequence are nicely listed in the lexicographical order. This means
that we order the vertices lexicographically by their labels and in this order we add to
the sequence each legal vertex (a vertex whose neighborhood is not contained in the
union of neighborhoods of previously chosen vertices). We denote the sequence by Ln

p is legal. If the last bit of v is 0 (v = hx1x2 . . . xn−10i) then v
footprints at least the vertex u = hx1x2 . . . xn−1(p − 1)i. Note that u is not footprinted
by any other vertex of Ln

2 ≤ l ≤ n, b > a and x1, . . . , xn−l, a, b ∈ [p]0 then v footprints u = hx1x2 . . . xn−lbal−1i.
Since b > a, all other neighbors of u are also lexicographically greater then v (note that
they are of the form hx1x2 . . . xn−lbal−2yi, where y ∈ [p]0 \ {a}). It is clear that the
vertices of Ln

To show that Ln

p is a γgr-sequence, we have to check its length. There are pn−1

4 Dominating sequences of interval graphs

In this section we present an algorithm that generates a Grundy dominating sequence
of an arbitrary interval graph. We will use the results of Section 2 concerning the
deletion of simplicial vertices and twins.

An interval representation of a graph is a family of intervals of the real line assigned
to vertices so that vertices are adjacent if and only if the corresponding intervals inter-
sect. A graph is an interval graph if it has an interval representation. For more detailes
on interval graphs see [3, 22].

11

Let us present the ordering and establish the notation of vertices in an interval
graph. Let G = (V, E) be an interval graph with an interval representation IG : V (G) →
{[a, b]; a, b ∈ R, a ≤ b}, and vertices V = {v1, . . . , vn} sorted in the non-decreasing
order according to the right endpoints of corresponding intervals.
In other words,
IG(vi) = [ai, bi], and b1 ≤ b2 ≤ . . . ≤ bn. It is clear that v1 is a simplicial vertex of G.
Let bA = {a1, b1, . . . an, bn} be the (multi)set of interval endpoints. We will also make use
of the non-decreasing sequence AIG of the real numbers from bA of length 2n, such that
all elements of bA are used; in the case ai = bj, for some i, j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n}, ai is in the

sequence before bj. We call the sequence AIG the interval endpoints sequence. In Fig. 4
an example of interval representation and interval endpoints sequence is presented.

Figure 4: An interval graph G with interval representation IG, interval endpoints se-
quence AIG and Grundy dominating sequence S returned by Algorithm 1.

Theorem 4.1 Algorithm 1 returns a Grundy dominating sequence of an interval graph
G. In addition, γgr(G) equals the number of consecutive subsequences of the form (ai, bj)
in the interval endpoints sequence AIG for any interval representation IG of G.

Proof. The proof goes by induction on the number of vertices of an interval graph G).
For |V | = 1 the length of the sequence of our algorithm is 1 which is clearly optimal.

Suppose now that the algorithm returns a Grundy dominating sequence for any
interval graph with at most n − 1 vertices and let G be an arbitrary interval graph with
n vertices. Let V (G) = {v1, . . . , vn} and let IG : V (G) → {[a, b] ; a, b ∈ R, a ≤ b} be
an interval representation of G with IG(vi) = [ai, bi] ordered according to their right
end-points, i.e., b1 ≤ b2 ≤ . . . ≤ bn. Let AIG be the corresponding interval endpoints
sequence. Since G − v1 is an interval graph with n − 1 vertices, the algorithm returns
the Grundy dominating sequence S ′ in G − v1 (using the induction hypothesis). Since
the vertex with the smallest right end-point is the ﬁrst vertex in the sequence produced
by the algorithm, v2 is the ﬁrst vertex of S ′.

There are two options for v1. First, suppose that v1 is a twin vertex in G. Then
v1 and v2 are twins, and, using Proposition 2.4(ii), γgr(G) = γgr(G − v1). Hence the

12

Algorithm 1: Grundy dominating sequence of an interval graph G.

Input: An interval graph G with vertices (v1, v2, . . . , vn) (where vi corresponds
to [ai, bi]), ordered according to their right end-points, and the interval
endpoints sequence AIG.

Output: Grundy dominating sequence S of a graph G.

2 newInterval = false;
3 A = AIG;

Choose e ∈ A such that A = (e) ⊕ A′;
if e is some ai then

newInterval = true;

else if e is some bi and newInterval is true then

S = S ⊕ (vi);
newInterval = false;

A = A′

sequence S ′ is also a Grundy dominating sequence in G. As v1 and v2 are twins, the
sequence S obtained from S ′ by replacing v2 with v1 is also a Grundy dominating
sequence in G. Note that S is exactly the sequence returned by Algorithm 1. Indeed,
since v1 and v2 are two consecutive vertices with respect to the right endpoints ordering
and are twins, no interval endpoint lies between b1 and b2; i.e., b1 and b2 are consecutive
endpoints in the sequence AIG. Hence, after v1 is put to S (and v2 is not), the algorithm
follows the same steps as the algorithm in G − v1. The proof of this case is complete.
Finally suppose that v1 is not a twin in G. Since v1 is simplicial in G, by Propo-
sition 2.4(i) we infer γgr(G) ≤ γgr(G − v1) + 1. As v2 is the ﬁrst vertex of S ′ and
N [v1] ( N [v2], S = (v1) ⊕ S ′ is a legal dominating sequence in G. Proposition 2.4(i)
again implies that γgr(G) = γgr(G − v1) + 1, which means that S is a Grundy domi-
nating sequence in G. Since S is the sequence returned by Algorithm 1, the proof of
the correctness of the algorithm is complete.

For the second statement in the theorem, one just needs to note that the algorithm
counts the number of consecutive subsequences of AIG, in which the ﬁrst vertex is a left
endpoint ai and the second vertex is a right endpoint bj. Since the Grundy domination
number of G is independent from the choice of its interval representation IG we infer
that the number of such subsequnces is also invariant under the interval representation.
(cid:3)

Let G be an arbitrary interval graph on n vertices and m edges.

It is easy to

13

see that the time complexity of Algorithm 1 is O(n), since the length of the interval
endpoints sequence is 2n. It is known that the time complexity of constructing interval
representation of an interval graph is O(n + m) [2, 11, 8]. To sort vertices according
to their right endpoints and to construct interval endpoints sequence O(n log n) time is
needed, since we just need to sort endpoints of intervals. Thus the time complexity of
preparing input data for Algorithm 1 is O(n log n + m). We derive the following result.

Corollary 4.2 Let G be an interval graph on n vertices and m edges. The time com-
plexity of preprocessing input data for Algorithm 1 is O(n log(n) + m), and Algorithm 1
is linear with complexity O(n).
