Abstract:

In this paper we propose a linear quiver with gauge groups of increasing rank as ﬁeld theory dual
to the AdS5 background constructed by Sfetsos and Thompson through non-Abelian T-duality.
The formalism to study 4d N = 2 SUSY CFTs developed by Gaiotto and Maldacena is essential
for our proposal. We point out an interesting relation between (Hopf) Abelian and non-Abelian
T-dual backgrounds that allows to see both backgrounds as diﬀerent limits of a solution constructed
by Maldacena and N´u˜nez. This suggests diﬀerent completions of the long quiver describing the
CFT dual to the non-Abelian T-dual background that match diﬀerent observables.

Introduction

Even in cases when a weakly coupled Lagrangian is not available, it is possible to make precise
statements about Quantum Field Theories (QFTs). When the theory is in a conformal phase, the
constraints imposed by the symmetries allow to calculate and obtain exact results. In two dimen-
sions for example, the so called minimal models allow various analytic computations without any
reference to a Lagrangian. Four-dimensional Conformal Field Theories (4d CFTs) are not as con-
strained as those in two dimensions, but it is also possible to have an analytic understanding of the
dynamics without a weakly coupled description, as long as there is some amount of supersymmetry.
A second way to deal with the problem of calculating observables for a CFT at strong coupling
(without the help of a Lagrangian) is to use a weakly coupled string theory on an Anti de-Sitter
space AdS [1]. Diﬀerent dualities – like SL(2, Z), T-duality– characteristic of string theory, have
become in this way common tools in the ﬁeld theoretical understanding of CFTs.

In this paper we will study the interplay between T-duality and the AdS/CFT correspondence.
Abelian T-duality in AdS string theory backgrounds is known to provide a mapping between
diﬀerent realisations of the same dual CFT, but a clear understanding of this for its non-Abelian
counterpart [2], [3], [4] is still missing. Since it is not proven that non-Abelian T-duality is a full
string theory symmetry [4], this opens the exciting possibility to construct new CFTs dual to AdS
string theory backgrounds, by the action of non-Abelian T-duality.

In the past four years, starting with the seminal paper [5], there has been quite some interest
on the applications of non-Abelian T-duality to backgrounds with a well understood QFT dual.
Roughly, the procedure adopted was to consider a background with a well-known dual pair, where
a non-Abelian T-duality on a–typically SU (2)– isometry was performed, generating a new solution
to the supergravity equations of motion. The calculation of various ﬁeld theoretical quantities
with the new background, allowed for a partial exploration of the QFT associated to it. This was
complemented with an analysis of SUSY preservation and G-structures, for the initial and ﬁnal
solutions. This procedure was adopted in various works [6]-[13]. A more precise description of the
QFT in terms of a quiver and a super-potential, was however mostly missing from these proposals.
One of the technical points preventing a clear QFT interpretation of non-Abelian T-duality is the
inﬁnite range of the dual coordinates [4].

In this paper we come back to the simple example of AdS5 × S5 to deal with this problem.
The outcome of our study will be a proposal for a 4d N = 2 SUSY CFT dual to the background
obtained by applying non-Abelian T-duality. Exploiting the fact that this geometry ﬁts in the
(Type IIA) classiﬁcation given by Lin, Lunin, Gaiotto and Maldacena in the papers [14], [15] we
will make important use of the formalism developed there to propose a ﬁeld theoretic description.
Reversing the logic, we will be able to identify the explicit Gaiotto-Maldacena geometry dual to
a 4d N = 2 superconformal linear quiver with gauge groups of increasing rank in terms of the
non-Abelian T-dual of AdS5 × S5 constructed in [5]. We will explore as well diﬀerent issues of the
(Hopf) Abelian T-dual of AdS5 × S5. We will show that it ﬁts in the previous classiﬁcation of

1

N = 2 geometries, thus providing a realisation of Zn orbifolds of AdS5 × S5 (including the trivial

case n = 1) as Gaiotto-Maldacena geometries, related to wrapped M5-branes. An interesting
connection between Abelian and non-Abelian T-dualities, mirrored by certain observables in the
associated dual CFTs will be proposed. This will be crucial in testing the dual CFTs. Even if
both Abelian and non-Abelian T-dual solutions obtained starting from AdS5× S5 are singular, this
does not prevent our analysis to go through—the observables we compute are not aﬄicted by the
singularity. Our analysis can be repeated in other smooth backgrounds such as the ones studied in
[6]-[13].

As will be explained in detail below, our results indicate that T-duality (Abelian and non-
Abelian), produces (as a generating technique) backgrounds in the Gaiotto-Maldacena class. These
are dual to CFTs involving long linear quivers at strong coupling. Hence, we could apply non-
abelian T-duality to a given Type II solution obtained as a ﬂow from a Gaiotto-Maldacena back-
ground, to generate a new one. This must be thought of as a dual description to a ﬂow from
a Gaiotto CFT. This idea is also applicable to solutions with less SUSY and smaller isometry
group (in cases where the Gaiotto-Maldacena formalism does not apply). This points to a way to
understand QFT phenomena in cases where the modern ﬁeld theoretical techniques do not apply.

The paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we present the Abelian and non-Abelian T-dual
backgrounds used in our investigations. We analyse quantised charges and large gauge transforma-
tions. While most of the material in this section is present in the bibliography, we will also point out
an interesting new relation between the Abelian and non-Abelian T-dual solutions. In Section 3,
we present the Hanany-Witten brane set-up that encodes and summarises the brane conﬁgurations
associated to the charges. In Section 4 we show that both backgrounds ﬁt the LLM-classiﬁcation
[14], and write the potentials associated to their Gaiotto-Maldacena descriptions [15]. Making use
of the formalism in [15] we then propose a quiver that describes the ﬁeld theory dual of the non-
Abelian T-dual background. We comment on a ﬁeld-theory inspired way of supplementing this
background to have a ﬁnite range for the T-dual coordinate r, that otherwise would be unbounded.
Then, in Section 5, we discuss ﬁeld theory aspects that can be read from our backgrounds. We
focus the attention on the central charge, entanglement entropy and ’t Hooft coupling of our CFTs.
The quivers that we propose are shown to precisely match the values of these observables. Finally,
in Section 5.4, we relate our 4d quivers with those used in deconstructing six dimensional CFTs
[16], [17]. Conclusions and possible lines to develop in the future are given in Section 6.

2 Geometry

In this section, we lay out the two Type IIA backgrounds that motivate this investigation. We
start by presenting the well-known IIB AdS5 × S5 background, to ﬁx notation and conventions.

The ranges of the angular coordinates are [0, π

and ψ in [0, 4π]. We deﬁne the generic polyform ˆF , the quantised Page charges and the constants

The ﬁrst type IIA background that will feature in our discussion is the Abelian T-dual, in the
direction ψ, of the AdS5 × S5 background in eq.(2.1). The T-dual coordinate, that we still denote
by ψ, has now periodicity π 1. Renaming (θ, ϕ) → (χ, ξ) and following the rules in [18], we ﬁnd,

Here we have chosen a particular gauge for B2. This gauge will prove to be very useful for our
discussion below. The dilaton and the gψψ component of the metric show that the background is
singular at 2α = π, where the original S3 in eq. (2.1) shrinks to a point. We thus expect a reduction
of supersymmetry. Indeed, the background in eq.(2.5) is known to be N = 2 supersymmetric [19],
and dual to the N = 2 realisation of N = 4 SYM with a hypermultiplet in the adjoint [20, 21].

1In the σ-model derivation of Abelian T-duality the periodicity of the dual variable is ﬁxed by the condition [22]

dθ ∧ d˜θ = (2π)2.

(2.4)

This implies that a θ variable with periodicity 2π is mapped to a ˜θ with the same periodicity. When the dualisation
is performed on a Hopf-ﬁbre direction of periodicity 4π the dual variable has periodicity π.

The factor of two compared to eq.(2.3) is due to the diﬀerent periodicities of the original and T-dual
variables. It is common to absorb it through a redeﬁnition of Newton’s constant. There is also
NS-ﬁve brane charge, obtained via the integration of H3 = dB2 on the three manifold spanned by
S2(χ, ξ) and the ψ-direction,

Here we have used that (2π)5g2
does not shrink at ψ = 0 or ψ = π. If, on the other hand, we allow the ψ-coordinate to vary in
[0, nπ], going n-times over the circle of length π, we ﬁnd that N5 = n, which tells us that one unit
of NS5-brane charge is created in each of these turns. We can link this to the existence of large
gauge transformations, as we will discuss in the next subsection. The resulting theory is the Abelian

T-dual of AdS5× S5/Zn, which has been shown to arise as the near horizon limit of a semi-localised

M5, M5’ system [19, 23] (with N4 M5 and n M5’, in our notation) followed by reduction to IIA.

2.2 The non-Abelian T-dual

The second type IIA background that we will discuss is the non-Abelian T-dual of eq.(2.1), ﬁrst
worked out in [5]. In the notation and conventions of [10] it reads,

As in the previous background both the dilaton and the grr component of the metric are sin-
gular at the point where the original S3 shrinks, 2α = π. We expect once more a reduction of
supersymmetry. Indeed, this background preserves N = 2 SUSY, as shown in [5].

(2.9)

As usual, after a non-Abelian T-duality transformation, the value of L2
α(cid:48) in eq.(2.9) is incompatible
with that in eq. (2.6). The radius of AdS5 must then take a diﬀerent value 2. According to eq.(2.9),

2In this example we could absorb the diﬀerent factor through a redeﬁnition of Newton’s constant, as in the Abelian
case. But this is not possible in general when there are more charges involved, as it is the case for instance in the
AdS6 and AdS4 backgrounds discussed in [11, 12].

4

D3-branes should be replaced by D6-branes after the non-Abelian T-duality. As we discuss below,
extending [13] (see also [11, 12]), there is however more to this interpretation.

As before, there is also NS5-brane charge associated to H3 = dB2. In order to properly deﬁne
this charge we need to know the range of the r-coordinate. However, in the absence of global
information coming from the sigma model derivation (there is no analogue to the condition in eq.
(2.4) in the non-Abelian case), the coordinate r ranges in R+. This poses an obvious problem to
the interpretation of the number N5.

In the papers [11, 12] an argument was proposed to determine the range of the coordinate r
in backgrounds like the one of eq.(2.8). It uses the boundedness of the action for a fundamental
Euclidean string that wraps a non-trivial two cycle. It amounts to impose that the quantity,

(cid:73)

b0 =

1

4π2α(cid:48)

B2,

Σ2

(2.10)

is bounded, b0 ∈ [0, 1]. In the case of the background in eq.(2.8), a non-trivial cycle is [11, 10],

Σ2 = [χ, ξ], α =

π
2

,

(2.11)

since the geometry spanned by α and S2(χ, ξ) close to 2α = π is conformal to a singular cone with
S2(χ, ξ) boundary. Imposing that the integral in eq.(2.10) is quantised, b0 = n, for some integer
n, implies the existence of special values rn = nπ for the r-coordinate, such that when r varies in
intervals [rn, rn+1], a piece-wise continuous large gauge transformation on the B2 potential

B2 → B2 − nπα

(cid:48)

sin χdχ ∧ dξ,

(2.12)

should be performed, bringing b0 back to be valued in the [0, 1] interval. This large gauge trans-
formation of the B2-ﬁeld, has an important eﬀect on the Page charges, that change as,

∆QD6 = 0, ∆QD4 = −nN6,

(2.13)

implying that D4 brane charge is created, N4 = nN6, in absolute value, when we pass through
rn = nπ points. Hence, the charge of D4 branes is not globally deﬁned, but depends on the interval
[rn, rn+1] where we measure it. Coming back to the quantisation of NS-ﬁve brane charge, we can
take the manifold Σ3 = [r, χ, ξ] to integrate H3 = dB2—in this case, we will also let the r-coordinate
vary in [0, nπ]. We ﬁnd,

So, every time we cross a rn point a unit of NS-ﬁve brane charge is added. We will use and give a
gauge theoretic interpretation to these results for the quantised charges in the next section.

Note that the present analysis of large gauge transformations holds as well in the Abelian T-dual
background of eq.(2.5). Indeed, in the gauge taken there for the B2 ﬁeld, there is also a non-trivial

5

2-cycle Σ2 = [χ, ξ] at 2α = π where large gauge transformations can be deﬁned. Thus, if we go
n-times over the circle of length π on which the ψ variable ranges, a continuous transformation of
parameter n, as in eq. (2.12), must be performed every time we cross a [nπ, (n + 1)π] interval. In
each of these turns a unit of NS5-brane charge is added, as we mentioned around eq. (2.7). The
diﬀerence with the non-Abelian case is that the D4-brane charge remains the same in each interval.
This will be an important observation when we compare the quivers associated to the Abelian and
non-Abelian T-dual backgrounds in Section 4.

2.3 Relation between the Abelian and non-Abelian T-duals

As observed in [13] in a more general context, the r → ∞ limit of the NS-NS sector of the non-
Abelian T-dual solution in eq.(2.8), reduces to that of the Abelian T-dual solution of eq.(2.5), with
the identiﬁcation r = ψ. In this section we make more concrete this relation, which will be very
inspiring in order to elucidate the ﬁeld theory dual to the non-Abelian solution.

First, one should notice that in the r → ∞ limit the dilaton ﬁelds of both solutions diﬀer by a
factor of r2. Recalling that the dilaton is determined by a 1-loop eﬀect in T-duality, this factor
is there to account precisely for the diﬀerent integration measures that enter in the deﬁnition of
the partition functions of the Abelian and non-Abelian T-dual σ-models, namely the measures
sin χDψDχDξ and r2 sin χDrDχDξ, respectively. Secondly, the observation above that r must be
divided in intervals of length π in order to properly account for large gauge transformations, allows
us to identify r and ψ globally for r → ∞ if we take r in a [nπ, (n + 1)π] interval and then send n
to inﬁnity. We will see in Section 5 that diﬀerent quantities associated to the ﬁeld theories dual to
both Abelian and non-Abelian backgrounds ( when computed with r in the [nπ, (n + 1)π] interval
for the non-Abelian solution) will indeed agree in this limit.

Let us turn to the analysis of the RR sector. Clearly, the ﬂuxes of the Abelian and non-Abelian
T-dual solutions in eqs.(2.5) and (2.8), are not the same in the r → ∞ limit. There is however a neat
relation between the associated quantized charges, that allows to conclude that both backgrounds
are still physically equivalent in this limit.

To be concrete, consider the non-Abelian T-dual background and look at the quantized charges
deﬁned in the r ∈ [nπ, (n + 1)π] interval, where the matching with the Abelian T-dual solution is
expected to occur. In this interval, using eqs.(2.9) and (2.13), we have

and the factor of diﬀerence can be safely absorbed through a redeﬁnition of Newton’s constant. We
have checked that this same type of rescaling relates the charges of the non-Abelian and Abelian
T-duals of other AdS backgrounds where more quantized charges are present. The expectation is
that this relation will hold more generally, and that we will be able to always absorb the nπ factor
through a redeﬁnition of Newton’s constant [24].

We will now discuss aspects of the CFTs dual to each of our backgrounds. We will start by

pointing out the relation with Hanany-Witten set-ups [25].

3 Brane realisation

In this section, we elaborate on a brane picture consistent with our previous ﬁndings for the
quantised charges. Let us ﬁrst recall that the brane set-up describing the Abelian T-dual of AdS5×
S5 is known in the literature. It consists on a set of N4 D4-branes stretched between two NS5-
branes that are identiﬁed [21]. The Abelian T-dual of AdS5 × S5/Zn is in turn associated to a

periodic array of NS5 and D4 branes [21, 23] as depicted in Figure 1.

Let us now move to the more interesting non-Abelian case. It was discussed in [13] —see eq.(3.16)
of that paper– that the non-Abelian T-dual of AdS5 × S5 should be related to a D4/NS5 brane set-
up. Indeed, the analysis of the ﬂuxes in eq.(2.8) and the quantised charges in eq.(2.9) suggests that
we are dealing with D4 branes extended on (R1,3, r) and NS-ﬁve branes extended along (R1,3, α, β).
The NS5 branes are localised at positions rn = nπ, as we learnt in eq.(2.14). At each interval
[rn, rn+1] there are nN6 D4-branes stretched in the r-direction. These branes can generate N6 D6
branes extended along (R1,3, r, χ, ξ) through Myers dielectric eﬀect [26]. Here we will use D4-branes
as colour branes. This will ﬁt the Gaiotto-Maldacena description in Section 4, and will also allow

branes and horizontal branes are D4-branes suspended between them. At each [nπ, (n+1)π] interval

the matching with the Abelian result. In the [0, π] interval the description should be, in turn, in
terms of D6 branes, which could be thought of as a strong coupling eﬀect, as we discuss in Section
5. The D4/NS5 brane set-up from π onwards is summarised in Figure 2.

The previous conﬁguration is very resemblant of Witten’s D4/NS5 brane set-up in [21], that
we brieﬂy summarise. Witten presented a Type IIA and M-theoretic brane picture for 4d N = 2
ﬁeld theories with a given number of gauge groups connected by bifundamental ﬁelds. The set-
up contains NS-ﬁve branes extended in the directions (R1,3, x4, x5) at diﬀerent positions x6,n in
the x6-direction, D4 branes extending in (R1,3, x6) in between the ﬁve branes and, possibly, D6
branes that cover the (R1,3, x7, x8, x9) directions. A ﬁve dimensional gauge theory is realised on
the four branes, but having these ﬁnite extension in the x6-direction, there is a suitable low-energy
limit (small energies compared to the inverse size of the D4 along x6) in which this ﬁeld theory is
eﬀectively four dimensional. The eﬀective gauge coupling behaves as 1
. In [21], it
g2
was explained how the branes bend, making x6 a function of the coordinates (x4, x5). The beta
function is encoded in this functional dependence of x6 = f (x4 + ix5), which is obtained by solving
a Laplace equation. The open strings connecting D4 branes stretched between diﬀerent sets of
NS5-branes represent bifundamental matter. The strings connecting these D4’s to either D6 branes
or semi-inﬁnite D4 branes (in the low energy limit above these have their excitations ’decoupled’,
acting like a global SU (N6) group), represent the fundamental matter. For ln D4-branes stretched
n=1 SU (ln) (
the U (1)(cid:48)s are actually frozen, as discussed in [21]), and there are (ln, ln+1) hypermultiplets, that
contribute to the SU (ln) β-function as ln−1 + ln+1 ﬂavors. Each SU (ln) gauge group has thus

b0,n = −2ln + ln+1 + ln−1.

(3.1)

This vanishes at each interval if 2ln = ln+1 + ln−1. Note that it is necessary to introduce semi-
inﬁnite D4 branes ending at the limiting NS5 branes, or D6-branes extended in (R1,3, x7, x8, x9),
to account for the necessary fundamentals of the SU (l1) and SU (lN ) gauge groups.

Many interesting developments came from this brane picture and its lift to M-theory. For ex-
ample, in eleven dimensions, the theta-angle is realised as periodic translations in x11, that is
Θ ∼ (x11,n+1 − x11,n). Higgs branches can be studied and a correspondence between the Seiberg-
Witten curve and the ’shape’ of the branes was developed.

If we compare the previous set-up with our proposed brane conﬁguration for the non-Abelian
T-dual of AdS5 × S5 (see Figure 2), we see that both are clearly the same if we identify the r-
coordinate of our non-Abelian conﬁguration with the x6-direction of Witten’s brane set-up. The
NS5 branes are localised at positions rn = x6,n = nπ and we can also identify (x4, x5) ∼ (α, β).
The number of D4 branes at each [rn, rn+1] interval is ln = nN6, and the beta function coeﬃcient
in eq.(3.1) clearly vanishes.

In Section 4, we will propose a conformal quiver that can be put in correspondence with this
brane set-up. An intuitive way to describe our brane set-up and quiver is to start with an array of
parallel NS-ﬁve branes, with a D6 ﬂavour brane on one of the ends of the array and move this D6
brane across the ﬁve branes towards the other end. Deﬁning a linking number associated with the
NS-ﬁve brane that has r6 (l6) D6 branes to its right (left) and R4 (L4) D4 branes to its right (left)
respectively,

LN S =

(r6 − l6) + L4 − R4,

2

we ﬁnd that LN S = −1/2 for all NS5-branes. Thus, the Hanany-Witten brane creation eﬀect [25],
associated with moving a ﬂavour D6 across the diﬀerent NS-ﬁve branes, can be used to give an
explanation for the n (created) D4-branes in a nth interval.

We will now make contact between our geometries in eqs.(2.5), (2.8) and the formalism developed
by Gaiotto and Maldacena in [15], to study the CFTs presented by Gaiotto in [27]. This formalism
was developed to study N = 2 CFTs associated to the brane set-up discussed above.

4 Abelian and non-Abelian T-duals as Gaiotto-Maldacena geome-

tries

In this section we show that both N = 2 backgrounds in eqs.(2.5) and (2.8) are examples of
Gaiotto-Maldacena backgrounds [15]. In the Abelian case this provides an explicit realisation of a
Zn orbifold of N = 4 SYM as a Gaiotto-Maldacena geometry in Type IIA. In the non-Abelian case

it will give an important hint for constructing the quiver describing its dual CFT.

In general, these N = 2 SUSY-preserving backgrounds with an AdS5 factor, can be written in
terms of a potential function V (σ, η). In particular, denoting V (cid:48) = ∂ηV and ˙V = σ∂σV , one can
write the Type IIA generic Gaiotto-Maldacena solution as [28, 29],

The radius of the space is µ2α(cid:48) = L2. The two-sphere dΩ2
2(χ, ξ) is parametrised by the angles χ and
ξ with corresponding volume form dΩ2 = sin χdχ ∧ dξ. The usual deﬁnition F4 = dC3 + A1 ∧ H3
is also used. The problem of writing IIA/M-theory solutions in this class, reduces to ﬁnding the
function V (σ, η) that solves a Laplace equation with a given charge density λ(η),

(4.1)

∂σ[σ∂σV ] + σ∂2

ηV = 0,

λ(η) = σ∂σV (σ, η)|σ=0 .

Interestingly, the background and ﬂuxes depend on ˙V ,
we have all that is needed to write the Type IIA background. Like in any other problem described
by a diﬀerential equation in partial derivatives, boundary conditions must be imposed. Gaiotto and
Maldacena found these conditions by enforcing a correct quantisation of charges and the smooth-
shrinking of some sub-manifolds. These conditions have been nicely summarised in [28], [29], they
are

˙˙V and V (cid:48)(cid:48) = −σ−2 ¨V . Hence, given ˙V ,

˙V (cid:48),

• ˙V (σ = 0, η) = λ(η) must vanish at η = 0.
• λ(η) must be a piecewise linear continuous function, composed of segments of the form λ =

aiη + qi, with ai an integer.

• The change in the slope of two consecutive kinks must be a negative integer, ai − ai−1 < 0. A
kink in which the gradient changes by k units is associated with D6 branes or Ak singularities
in the M-theory lift.

• The positions of the kinks must be at integer values in the η-axis.
• Some solutions satisfy λ(N∗) = 0. In this case, the η-coordinate is bounded in [0, N∗]. The
associated electrostatic problem consists of a line of charge density λ(η), bounded by two
’conducting plates’ at the points η = 0, η = N∗.

From the previous electrostatic problem it is possible to read-oﬀ the quiver associated to the N = 2
dual CFT. As summarised in [28], [29],

• An SU (ni) gauge group is associated to each integer value of η = ηi, with the rank ni given

by the value of the charge density at that point, λ(ηi) = ni.

10

• A kink in the line proﬁle corresponds to extra ki fundamentals attached to the gauge group

at the node ni.

Finally, let us recall the Maldacena-N´u˜nez background written in [30].

It was shown in [28]
that this background can be considered as a fundamental building block from which many N = 2
Type IIA solutions can be constructed. We will show that this is the case for both our Abelian
and non-Abelian T-dual solutions.
In the Gaiotto-Maldacena formalism, the Maldacena-N´u˜nez
background is described by a potential VM N (σ, η) whose derivative and associated charge density
take the simple expression,

(Nc − η)2 + σ2(cid:105)

With these pieces of the formalism in place, we will show that our Abelian and non-Abelian
T-dual backgrounds ﬁt in. We shall also discuss the connection between VM N and the potentials
describing the Abelian and non-Abelian T-dual backgrounds. To this we turn now.

4.1 The case of the Abelian T-dual of AdS5 × S5

For the Abelian T-dual background in eq.(2.5), after redeﬁning

2L2
α(cid:48) η, σ = sin α,
the potential V (σ, η) and charge density λ(η) are found to be,

ψ = r =

λ(η) = 1.

(4.3)

(4.4)

Scaling the metric as in [15] we ﬁnd λ(η) = N4, with N4 the number of D4-branes that create
the background. It corresponds to the charge proﬁle (a) in Figure 3. Though this charge density
does not satisfy the boundary condition λ(η = 0) = 0, this case is still compatible with the quivers

depicted in Figure 4, describing the Zn orbifold of N = 4 SYM using N = 2 language [21]. Indeed,

in this case the η-direction is periodic, hence we do not need to impose the conditions mentioned
above, in particular, we do not have to impose the condition λ(0) = 0.

Note that the number of ﬂavours and the number of colours satisfy Nf = 2N4 = 2Nc for each node
in the circular quiver depicted in Figure 4, leading to a vanishing beta function in correspondence
with the AdS5 factor in the geometry.

4.2 The case of the Non-Abelian T-dual of AdS5 × S5

For the non-Abelian T-dual background in eq.(2.8), redeﬁning variables again as in eq.(4.3), the
potential function and charge density are found to be [5, 13],

Figure 4: N = 2 quivers associated to N = 4 SYM and its Zn orbifold.

Notice that this background, does satisfy the condition λ(0) = 0. The charge density λ(η) gives
the proﬁle (b) in Figure 3, which, following the rules summarised in the previous subsection, is
in correspondence with a long quiver with gauge group U (1) × SU (2) × SU (3) × SU (4) × ... and
bifundamental hyper-multiplets connecting the nodes, as depicted in Figure 5.
Interestingly, it
describes the “tail” quiver that appears in the Argyres-Seiberg dual of the N = 2 conformal quiver
with (N − 1) SU (N ) gauge groups discussed in [15]. It is associated to a dual CFT with inﬁnite
ordinary punctures.

This quiver is in full agreement with the brane set-up that we described in the previous section,
depicted in Figure 2.
Indeed, rescaling the metric as in [15] we ﬁnd that the charge density
becomes λ(η) = ηN6 and the gauge group SU (N6) × SU (2N6) × SU (3N6) × SU (4N6) × ..., which
is in correspondence with a conﬁguration of nN6 D4-branes stretched between NS5-branes located
at rn = nπ, consistently with our analysis. As in [15] the elementary punctures are associated to

the NS ﬁvebranes, of which there are strictly an inﬁnite number, for r ∈ R+.

Next, we propose two possible ways of completing this quiver that give the right answer for the
central charge (that we shall compute in Section 5). As we will comment, completing the quiver
implies an analog ’completion’ in the geometry, that is, a way to eﬀectively work with an η or

r-coordinate with ﬁnite range. This is a nice example of the CFT ’informing’ the dual geometry.

The ﬁrst completion is given by a linear quiver consisting on a long chain of gauge groups

SU (N6) × SU (2N6) × SU (3N6) × .... × SU(cid:0)(p − 1)N6

(cid:1), ﬁnishing with a ﬂavour group SU (pN6) as

in Figure 6. This corresponds to the proﬁle (a) in Figure 7. Notice that at the point η = p − 1 we
have a change of slope of size pN6, which represents the SU (pN6) ﬂavour group, as summarized
above. The number of ﬂavours and the number of colours are such that Nf = 2N4 = 2Nc is satisﬁed
for each node in the quiver, leading to a vanishing beta function in correspondence with the AdS5
factor in the geometry. This quiver can be put in correspondence with the brane set-up that we
proposed in Section 3. Indeed, a long array of NS-ﬁve branes with a given number of D4 branes,
N4 = nN6, in the n-th interval describes our conformal quiver. The ﬂavour group that we proposed
to complete the quiver can be thought of as a set of pN6 semi-inﬁnite D4-branes or D6 branes on
the right of the pth NS5 brane.

We stress that our addition of the ﬂavour group should be thought of (via holography) as a way
of ending the space or giving a ﬁnite range to the r-coordinate. The consequence of this will be
reﬂected in the holographic calculation of observables, that will involve integrals and sums in a
ﬁnite range as we show in Section 5.

We can be more precise regarding the geometry associated with this completed quiver. Following
the Gaiotto-Maldacena rules [15] and the content of the papers [28], [29] we can write the charge
density λ(η) associated with it as

(cid:26) η

λ(η)
N6

=

(1 − p)η + (p2 − p)

0 ≤ η ≤ p − 1
(p − 1) ≤ η ≤ p

As in [28], the idea is to write the ˙V , and the respective charge density λ(η) associated with our
˙VM N (and λM N ) in eq.(4.2). Following the treatment in
quiver in Figure 6, as a superposition of

[28],[29], we ﬁnd the precise ˙V , in terms of which (and its derivatives) the background is written,

Again, note that at the point η = p, we have a change in the slope of λ(η) of size pN6. This
is in correspondence with the SU (pN6) global symmetry realised on the D6-ﬂavour branes, which
provide the boundary condition to end the space at η = p.

A second possibility to complete the non-Abelian quiver in Figure 5 is to consider its Z2 orbifold
in Figure 8. This completed orbifold makes full use of the idea, discussed in Section 2.3 and further
stressed at the end of this section, that the Abelian theory functions as a sort of completion for
r → ∞ of the non-Abelian one. The orbifold in Figure 8 has associated a charge density

(4.7)

We wish to point out an interesting feature, relating the solution characterised by ˙VM N in
eq.(4.2), with the analog derivatives ˙VAT D and ˙VN AT D (this relation is cleaner for the derivatives
of the potentials ˙V , but holds also without performing the σ-derivative). As it can be inferred from
the charge densities displayed in Figure 3, VM N should interpolate between the Abelian (for large
η) and the non-Abelian (for small η) backgrounds. This is indeed the case. Expanding ˙VM N close
to (σ, η) ∼ (0, 0), one ﬁnds, up to order O(ηaσb), with a + b < 4, that ˙VM N ≈ ˙VN AT D. This was
already observed in [13]. More interestingly, one can perform an expansion for σ ∼ 0 and large
values of η, whose result is a ˙VM N ≈ ˙VAT D– up to the same order in the expansion as above.

Further to this, the solution characterised by VM N is smooth, while both backgrounds obtained
by T-duality are singular at σ = 1. A 3-d plot (in Figures 9,10) of the three potentials shows a very
good matching between ˙VM N with ˙VN AT D (for small η) and between ˙VM N and ˙VAT D (for large
˙VM N diﬀers from both ˙VAT D and ˙VN AT D, that lead to a
η), both for σ ∼ 0. For values of σ ∼ 1,
singularity at σ = 1. Hence, using the superpositions in eqs.(4.6), (4.7) smoothes-out the singular
spaces obtained through Abelian and non-Abelian T-duality. Indeed, notice that the summation
of ˙VM N functions has two eﬀects: on one side, it bounds the range of the radial coordinate η or r.
On the other hand, as we explained, it smoothes out the T-dual geometries at σ = 1, where the
backgrounds were singular.

Let us discuss another interesting feature of the backgrounds we have presented. Once completed

values of σ ∼ 1. While both ˙VAT D, ˙VN AT D vanish,

˙VAT D (in blue) and ˙VN AT D (in green) superposed, for

as indicated by the associated quivers, and encoded by the functions ˙V (σ, η) given in eqs. (4.6)-
(4.7), these solutions correspond to the “one NS5-stack” class of backgrounds, according to the
classiﬁcation of [29]. This implies that the couplings of each of the gauge groups are arbitrarily
large. The parameters associated with the marginal coupling of each gauge group are only visible
in the “many NS5 stacks” backgrounds of [29]. Our solutions, obtained via a generating technique
from AdS5 × S5 do not contain those parameters to begin with, so they are dual to the quivers we
proposed in the limit of very large gauge couplings (the NS5 branes have sub-stringy separations
when the σ-coordinate grows large).

To close this section we make a couple of comments that will be useful when comparing ob-
servables of the CFT calculated with the Abelian and non-Abelian T-dual backgrounds. The
expressions for the potentials and charge densities for the Abelian and non-Abelian T-duals show
that these quantities in the Abelian T-dual background, eq.(4.4), give place to those in the non-
Abelian T-dual one, in eq.(4.5), by superposition (or integration) in the η-direction. Intuitively,
this suggests that non-Abelian T-duality can be thought of as a form of ’superposition’ of Abelian
T-dualities. It is also interesting to replace nN6 → N4 in each interval [nπ, (n + 1)π] and see that
our quiver dual to the non-Abelian T-dual background is identical to the quiver describing the
Abelian background with 0 ≤ ψ ≤ nπ. The main diﬀerence is that the linear quiver dual to the
background of eq.(2.8) does not close in a circle. There is in fact more to this intuitive view, as we
will stress in the next section.

In summary, inspired by the Gaiotto-Maldacena formalism and the brane realisations of 4d
N = 2 CFTs studied by Witten, we have proposed a particular quiver as dual to the non-Abelian
AdS5 solution. We have discussed possible ways of ’completing’ this quiver, read the proﬁles λ(η)
associated to them, attained the boundary conditions and smoothed-out the backgrounds.

16

We wish to check now our proposal against some ﬁeld theory observables. These will be calculated

in the gravitational and the CFT descriptions of our system. To this we turn now.

5 Observables in the Quantum Field Theory

In this section we compute important physical quantities of the quantum ﬁeld theories associated
with the quivers proposed in the previous section as duals to the Abelian and non-Abelian back-
grounds. We show that they are perfectly consistent with the holographic results. This provides
crucial complementary information to understand the ﬁeld theoretical operation associated with
non-Abelian T-duality. We start analysing the central charges.

5.1 Central Charges

We can calculate holographically the central charges of the conformal theories associated to the
Abelian and non-Abelian geometries using the formalism developed in [31, 10]. Brieﬂy and to set
notation, for a string-theory dual to a (d + 1)-dimensional QFT, with line element

in terms of which, the central charge for the (d + 1)-dimensional QFT reads,

Let us ﬁrst compute the central charge for the original AdS5 × S5 background in eq.(2.1). In this
case, we have

5.1.1 The central charge for the Abelian T-dual of AdS5 × S5
For the Abelian T-dual background in eq.(2.5) we have the same values of a(R, θi), b(R) and d as
in AdS5 × S5. Using the quantisation condition in eq.(2.6) we ﬁnd,

(5.6)

which is the expected result, as the central charge is invariant under T-duality. Note that even if
there is a rescaling by a factor of 2 in the conserved charges associated to the original and T-dual
backgrounds, the central charges are the same in terms of the respective conserved charges, showing
the equivalence of the associated CFTs. We would like to stress that this background provides an
example of a Gaiotto-Maldacena geometry, related to M5-branes, whose central charge does not
scale with N 3. We will elaborate more on this in Section 6.

For ﬁeld theories with N = 2 SUSY, the central charge is written in terms of the number of
degrees of freedom contained in vector multiplets, nv, and the analog number for hyper-multiplets,
nh, as [32],

c =

(2nv + nh).

(5.7)

12

Using this, we can check that the quiver consisting of one gauge group SU (N4) with one vector
multiplet and one adjoint hypermultiplet, depicted in Figure 4, gives the central charge

c =

2(N 2

4 − 1) + N 2

,

(5.8)

that in the limit of large number of four branes coincides with the holographic result in eq.(5.6).
In turn, if we let ψ cover the [0, π] interval n times, that is ψ ∈ [0, nπ], the central charge reads

c = n

(5.9)

which is precisely that of the Zn orbifold of N = 4 SYM with gauge group SU (N4), c = (nN4)2

[23].

We now check that the circular quiver in Figure 4 matches the holographic result. We can count

the number of degrees of freedom present in vector and hyper-multiplets,

to ﬁnally obtain

In agreement with eq.(5.9) and reference [23]. Let us now study our non-Abelian T-dual system.

5.1.2 The central charge for the non-Abelian T-dual of AdS5 × S5
Here, we analyse the non-Abelian T-dual case. The central charge of the geometry in eq.(2.8) was
calculated in [13]. We have the same values of a(R, θi), b(R) and d as in the previous backgrounds.
Using now the quantisation condition in eq.(2.9) and a range for the r-coordinate between 0 and

we see the N 3
5 scaling with the number of NS5-branes in Type IIA (or M5-branes in the eleven
dimensional lift) appearing due to the integration range in the whole [0, nπ] interval. We now check
that the completed quivers proposed to describe the CFT dual to this background, see Figures 6
and 8, reproduce the result of eq.(5.12).

For the completed quiver consisting on a long chain of gauge groups SU (N6) × SU (2N6) × .. ×
SU ((p − 1)N6) and ﬁnishing with a ﬂavour group SU (pN6) in Figure 6, we can count the number

There is a third possibility to recover the right value for the central charge in eq.(5.12), in terms
of ‘Abelian’ quivers. It corresponds to the quiver depicted in Figure 11. This quiver starts with
a ﬂavour group SU (pN6), followed by a long string of p
3 SU (pN6) gauge groups, ﬁnishing with
another ﬂavour group SU (pN6). Following [28],[29], we ﬁnd that the charge density λ(η) and ˙V for

thus matching the result in eq.(5.12). It is likely that this quiver can be interpreted as dual to our
previously proposed completed quivers as in some of the examples in [15].

Finally, we wish to discuss a possible strong coupling realisation of the central charge obtained
in eq.(5.12), that tries to highlight the fact that it seems to be the result of an orbifold by ZN6 of
a theory of n NS5-branes:

as in eq.(5.12). Note that a conﬁguration of NS5-branes stretched between D6-branes is related by
a chain of T-S-T dualities to a D4/NS5 brane set-up. Our NS5-branes would lie in the (R1,3, α, β)
directions and would be stretched between D6-branes lying on (R1,3, r, χ, ξ). The S-duality opera-
tion involved in this relation would imply that this conﬁguration would be strongly coupled, which
could be in correspondence with this description in terms of strongly coupled Tn building blocks.

5.1.3 Relation between Abelian and non-Abelian T-duals

Let us now check how the relation between Abelian and non-Abelian T-dual backgrounds previously
discussed, is satisﬁed in the ﬁeld theory side. In light of our previous discussion, we should be able

varying in the [nπ, (n + 1)π] interval. We obtain

where we have used that in this interval N4 = nN6. The Abelian limit of this expression amounts
to taking n → ∞ —in correspondence with the large r limit discussed in Section 2.3. In this limit
eq.(5.23) indeed reduces to eq.(5.6). This suggests that the CFT dual to the non-Abelian solution
in the r ∈ [(n − 1)π, nπ] interval behaves, when n → ∞, eﬀectively as a hypermultiplet in the
adjoint of SU (nN6). Moreover, this calculation suggests that non-Abelian T-duality in an interval
of length π is a ’corrected’ (that is, capturing O( 1
n )-ﬁnite size eﬀects) version of Abelian T-duality.
N 2

4 arises as the
derivative with respect to n of the non-Abelian central charge in the [0, nπ] interval, given in eq.
(5.12), recall that here N5 = n. This happens because we can calculate the derivative of c as the
limit when n goes to inﬁnity of the diﬀerence of its values in the [0, (n + 1)π] and [0, nπ] intervals,
which is exactly what is done to obtain eq.(5.23). Again, non-Abelian T-duality seems to arise
as a sort of superposition of Abelian T-dualities, as we already observed when we computed the
potentials and charge densities associated to both solutions.

A further interesting observation is that the Abelian T-dual central charge c =

Another observable that behaves similarly to the central charge is the entanglement entropy,

that we study next.

5.2 Entanglement entropy

A very similar behaviour to that of the central charge is found for the entanglement entropy.
Indeed, considering a strip geometry of size l and after regularisation (see [33] for the precise general
expressions), we have that the entanglement entropy and the size of the strip for the diﬀerent four
dimensional CFTs is given by,

Once again, we can make a correspondence between the entanglement entropy of the Abelian

5.3 Couplings

In this section we calculate the couplings associated to the 4d CFTs dual to both the Abelian and
non-Abelian T-dual backgrounds. To do so we switch on an electromagnetic ﬁeld on a colour brane
probe in these theories and compute the value of the coupling of the F 2
µν-operator. For the Abelian
T-dual background, we consider a BPS probe D4-brane wrapped on ψ. For the non-Abelian T-dual
we take a probe D4-brane wrapped on r. In this case, we ﬁnd that the D4-probes are BPS only
when located at the singularity 2α = π. This is consistent with the fact that D4-branes have
associated a non-vanishing charge N4 = nN6 only in the presence of large gauge transformations,
and these are deﬁned in a 2-cycle that sits at the singularity.

First, to set notation, we compute the gauge coupling of the original AdS5 × S5 background. In
this case we consider a probe D3 brane, whose world-volume is on R1,3–the Minkowski directions–
and stands at some ﬁxed value of the R-coordinate. The RR potential C4 that follows from eq.(2.1)
is C4 = 16R4
L4 dt ∧ dx1 ∧ dx3 ∧ dx3. Switching on an electromagnetic ﬁeld on the brane (that for
simplicity we take to be F2 = Ftxdt ∧ dx1) we obtain the BIWZ-action,

Let us now move to the T-dual examples. In the Abelian background of eq.(2.5), we consider
the motion of a probe D4-brane that extends in the Minkowski and ψ-directions, for a ﬁxed value
of the R-coordinate. We also switch on an electromagnetic ﬁeld Ftx. We ﬁnd that the relevant RR
potential is in this case, C5 = 16√α(cid:48) R4
L4 dt ∧ dx1 ∧ dx2 ∧ dx3 ∧ dψ. The BIWZ action takes a simple
expression, after a cancellation between the dilaton and the gψψ component of the metric,

Hence, the larger the number of nodes n in the quiver, the weaker this coupling becomes. For the

eq.(2.8). The RR potential that couples to the D4 brane in this background is,

with N4 the non-Abelian D4 brane charge, given by N4 = nN6, with N6 as in (2.9). This gives
us the gauge coupling for each of the SU (nN6) gauge groups in the non-Abelian quiver. It clearly
shows that the coupling decreases as we approach the ‘Abelian’ region, n → ∞, leaving a strongly
coupled theory in the [0, π] interval. Note that eq.(5.32) fully agrees with the Abelian result, given
in eq. (5.28), in the large n limit. This calculation suggests, once more, that non-Abelian T-duality
in a length π interval captures O(1/n)-ﬁnite size eﬀects of its Abelian counterpart. Note as well
that the observables associated with these gauge couplings, namely, the ’t Hooft couplings, satisfy

λA = g2

D4,AN4,A = 2πN4,A.

λN A = g2

D4,N AN4,N A = 2πN4,A,

(5.33)

(here we have made explicit that in each case we have to multiply by the respective quantised
charge) and so both ’t Hooft coupling are exactly the same in both theories.

Finally, in order to complete this picture, we show that it is possible to construct BPS D6-branes
in the non-Abelian T-dual background that can be used as colour branes in the r ∈ [0, π] interval,
where there are no large gauge transformations and thus no D4-branes present. As we have shown
in the previous analysis of the couplings, this region corresponds to a strongly coupled region in
which our description in terms of D4-branes stretched between NS5-branes may not apply. It may
be possible that a suitable description of the theory in this region is in terms of the Tn building
blocks in Figure 13 that we have discussed.

The RR potentials that couple to the D6 branes in this background are

which clearly cancels against the integrated WZ contribution in eq.(5.34). Note that these branes
need not be placed at the 2α = π singularity in order to be BPS. This is consistent with the fact
that they exist even in the case of vanishing large gauge transformations.

Figure 14: Circular quiver for SU (N )k

5.4 Relation with Deconstruction

The expressions for the couplings of the Abelian and non-Abelian T-dual theories are very suggestive
of deconstructed extra dimensions.

In the spirit of [16, 17] a 4d N = 2 CFT can be seen as the UV completion, at distances shorter
than the lattice spacing, of a latticised 5d N = 2 CFT compactiﬁed on a circle. The connection
between these 4d and 5d theories is made concrete through the study of a 4d N = 2 CFT described
by a circular quiver, depicted in Figure 14, with k SU (N ) gauge groups, all with gauge coupling G,
connected by bi-fundamentals. At low energies compared to the energy scale set by the expectation
values of the bifundamental ﬁelds, ΦI, the action describes a 5d N = 2 ﬁeld theory with a latticised
extra dimension with lattice spacing a = 1/(GΦ), and 5d gauge coupling g2
5 = G/Φ [17]. The radius
of the ﬁfth dimension is given by 2πR5 = ka. For E << 1/R5 the theory reduces instead to a 4d
N = 4 CFT, with gauge group SU (N ) and gauge coupling
.

It was also shown in [16] that a sixth extra dimension arises at distances large compared to a
as a result of the S-duality symmetry of the 4d N = 4 theory: g4 ↔ 1/g4, which, using eq.(5.36),
implies that G ↔ N/G. Applying this to the spectrum of massive gauge bosons in the latticised
5d theory (also approximated for large k):

Figure 14 provides then a discretisation of a 6d theory, which turns out to be the (2, 0) CFT living
in N M5-branes [17].

26

SU(N)SU(N)SU(N)SU(N)SU(N)SU(N)After this brief summary of the ideas of [16, 17], we will provide an explicit string theoretical
realisation of them. Indeed, the N = 2 quiver in [17] is the circular quiver that we proposed as
dual to our Abelian geometry in eq.(2.5), for ψ in a [0, kπ] interval. The 4d ﬁeld theories with
gauge coupling G live in the worldvolumes of D4-branes stretched between NS5-branes, which are
therefore wrapped on ψ-intervals of length π. The eﬀective lattice spacing is a = π. Using eq.
(5.27), we ﬁnd for G, the gauge coupling of each of the SU (N ) nodes,

1
G2 =

1
2π2

kπ

dψ =

1
2π

.

(5.39)

This is the coupling of each node in the microscopic theory. At low energies compared to the inverse
lattice spacing, the theory should reduce to a 4d CFT with coupling g2
4 = G2/k. This corresponds
to the gauge coupling of the 4d theory living on the world-volume of D4-branes wrapped on the
whole circular dimension of length ka = kπ. Indeed, at low energies after the Higgs mechanism
occurred, the gauge group is a diagonal combination of all of the microscopic gauge groups. We
can then calculate this coupling from eq. (5.27) for n = k to be,

(5.40)

in agreement with eq.(5.36). The ﬁve dimensional CFT at intermediate energies, appears when
considering a mode expansion of the fundamental ﬁelds (vector and hypers in the quiver of Figure
14), that will have periodic boundary conditions on the ψ-coordinate, a calculation that was care-
fully explained in [34]. This also suggests that in the Abelian case, the ψ-direction represents the
’theory space’ of the quiver in Figure 14.

Let us now try to ﬁnd a similar interpretation for the non-Abelian quiver in Figure 6. The
situation is a bit more complicated, because our proposed quiver is not periodically identiﬁed. But
a similar reasoning suggests that a higher dimensional theory emerges. Indeed, each of the gauge
groups in the linear quiver in Figure 6 has a diﬀerent gauge coupling that can be computed from
the ﬂuctuations of D4-branes wrapped on r ∈ [kπ, (k + 1)π], as in eq.(5.32):

(5.41)

This is associated with the coupling of each of the nodes of the microscopic CFT. If we now let
r vary in the whole [0, kπ] interval we ﬁnd that, in the same spirit as above, after Higgsing, the
theory would reduce, at low energies, to a 4d CFT. The gauge group is a diagonal combination of
the microscopic ones, and the gauge coupling of this IR CFT is,

(5.42)

Again, this follows the same logic as the Abelian quiver, in this case the r-direction should be
the theory space direction. Similar to the Abelian case, one might also argue that the non-Abelian
quiver deconstructs two extra directions, hence relating them to the theory on ﬁve-branes.

27

Related ideas that are likely to be useful in a more careful treatment of the material in this

section, have been discussed in [35].

6 Conclusions and future directions

Let us brieﬂy summarise, draft some conclusions and speculate about further directions to develop.

We have presented a proposal for the dual CFT to the background obtained by non-Abelian
T-duality on AdS5 × S5. Our CFT preserves N = 2 SUSY and ﬁts in the description of [14],[15],
as a ’long quiver’ CFT. We have put forward an interesting relation between the Abelian and non-
Abelian backgrounds that also works on the ﬁeld theory side, as a mapping between observables.
The intuition is that a non-Abelian observable is related to its Abelian counterpart by a ’discrete
diﬀerentiation’ along the T-dual coordinate (called ψ or r in this work). This connection is valid
to leading order for large values of r. It suggests that non-Abelian T-duality can be ’continued’ at
large distances by its Abelian counterpart. The solution in [30] provides an explicit expression for
this ’continuation’. We have also shown that the Gaiotto-Maldacena formalism can be used on our
backgrounds to provide this continuation and smooth them out.

We applied this logic to important observables in the 4d CFT: central charge, Entanglement
Entropy and ’t Hooft couplings. They follow the connection above mentioned between the Abelian
and non-Abelian results. We found precise four dimensional N = 2 SUSY preserving quivers
matching the values of these observables.

Reversing the logic, the ﬁeld theory we proposed suggests a picture in which Abelian T-duality
could be ’completed’ for small values of the dual coordinate by its non-Abelian counterpart. This
is in line with what we discussed in Section 4, where the solution in [30] was shown to interpolate
between the non-Abelian (small η) and the Abelian (large η) backgrounds for σ = 0. This can be
seen as a realisation of the idea in [36], that non-Abelian T-duality provides a zoom-in on some
part of a globally well-deﬁned background, in this case the one in reference [30]. We presented
precise formulas showing this.

In the purely Abelian set-up we showed that the (Hopf) Abelian T-dual of AdS5 × S5 ﬁts in
the classiﬁcation in [15] of N = 2 geometries, thus providing a connection between Zn orbifolds
(including the trivial case n = 1) of N = 4 SYM and ﬁeld theories living in M5-branes. This solution
provides an explicit example in which the central charge scales with a N 2 power even if associated
to M5-branes. N α scalings with α (cid:54)= 3 in candidate dual ﬁeld theories living in M5-branes have
been reported before in the non-Abelian T-duality literature (see for instance [9]). Here we have
shown that it is a common feature also present in more standard Abelian T-dual backgrounds, that
remains to be fully understood. We have completed our analysis of the Abelian T-dual solution with
a precise realisation of the theory space in [16], from where the 6d N = (2, 0) CFT is deconstructed,
in terms of the Type IIA quiver describing the Abelian T-dual of AdS5 × S5/Zn.

In the non-Abelian set up, we have seen that diﬀerent possible quivers match precisely the
central charge in eq.(5.12). It is very likely that these descriptions are related through dualities

28

as it happens for some of the quivers proposed in [15]. This is currently under investigation [24].
Similarly, we believe that it would be worth to further study the deconstruction of a 6d CFT from
the non-Abelian T-dual solution, where a six dimensional theory seems to emerge directly at low
energies, after Higgsing our proposed quiver.

An interesting outcome of our studies is the mapping between backgrounds generated by T-
duality and Gaiotto-Maldacena geometries. The strongly coupled conformal dynamics of these
long linear quivers as well as their deformations and ensuing RG-ﬂow can then be studied using the
dual description that non-Abelian T-duality provides. In cases of ﬂows to conﬁning ﬁeld theories
or CFTs with less SUSY, modern ﬁeld theoretical techniques do not apply and the dual geometry
seems to be the only present tool to tack these problems.

Let us present now, a set of interesting open problems that could be addressed following the

developments in this paper.

It would be interesting to ﬁnd a precise CFT description for the backgrounds obtained via non-
Abelian T-duality in other AdS geometries. The AdS5 × T 1,1 case seems the most accessible and
promising, but extensions to AdS4 × Σ6, AdS3 × Σ7, AdS6 × Σ4 cases should also work out nicely.
It is expected that the relations between non-Abelian and Abelian T-dual solutions found in this
work, as well as our ﬁeld theory interpretation for the non-Abelian T-dual in terms of a long quiver,
will also be applicable in these cases. This would allow to explain in more generality the interplay
between non-Abelian T-duality and AdS/CFT. Indeed, the reader familiar with the papers [37],
should appreciate the parallelism between their AdS7 case study and our AdS5 example. It is then
clear that it should exist a common formalism in these and many other examples.

It would also be interesting to extend our ﬁeld theoretical study to geometries that ﬂow to a
’conﬁning background’ (or backgrounds representing a ﬂow between CFTs). This would provide a
holographic description of the low-energy conﬁning (or conformal) phase that appears by deforming
some of the CFTs above. The ’geometric’ side of the work was done in some of the papers in [6],[8].
The present work gives tools to complement that study with a more precise QFT description. This
will also suggest how to extend the CFTs to the conﬁning phase, this is something quite hard to
achieve with present ﬁeld theoretical techniques.

Furthermore, it would be nice to study the spectra of the ﬂuctuations of our probe D4 branes
(mesons). Particularly interesting would be to check if the connection with deconstruction we
have explained, implies that the strongly coupled spectrum gets a KK-like behaviour or more
interestingly even a sin2( kπ

N ), as predicted by the weak-coupling analysis done in deconstruction.

We hope to report on these and other subtle problems in the future.
