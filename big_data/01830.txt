In this study, we explore the validity of the original Heisenberg position-momentum uncertainty
relation for a macroscopic harmonic oscillator interacting with environmental micro- particles. Our
results show that, in the quasi-classical situation, the original uncertainty relation does not hold
when the number of particles in the environment is small. Nonetheless, increasing the environmental
degrees of freedom resolves the violation in the region of our investigation.

INTRODUCTION

Macroscopic quantum systems (MQSs) has been broadly studied in literature since 1980 (see, e.g., [1–5]). It is
commonly believed that macroscopic refers to those situations where a large number of particles are involved, or to
be more precise, it holds for a system when the number of dynamical degrees of freedom is large [4]. The assumption
of macro-realism indicates that a MQS with two or more macroscopically distinct states availabel to it, is at all times
in one or the other of these states, independent of observation. This assumption is called macroscopic deﬁniteness
[2]. This may aﬀect some fundamental features of a MQS, specially when the system is in interaction with the
environmnet, because the physical parameters of the latter could relatively control the state deﬁnitness of the former
by aﬀecting the properties of the system in an integrated context.

Moreover, the study of the open quantum systems is an important subject in physics community due to its various
applications e.g., in quantum optics, solid-state physics, specially in quantum information. Recently, by the develop-
ment of quantum information theory, there has been a strong revival in the study of open quantum systems aimed
at further understanding the impact of these systems on quantum information theory [6]. In a general approach, the
study of such systems is based on theirs dissipative and dephasing behaviors. This is conventionally pursued by three
approaches: a) introducing an eﬀective Hamiltonain, b) solving a quantum master equation, and c) using a quantum
Langevin equation. The last two approaches are both based on modeling the system interacting with a thermal bath,
while the ﬁrst one is described by a time-dependent or non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, which would lead to a dissipative
dynamic equation [7–9].

Quantum mechanical interference eﬀects may be washed out by the inﬂuence of the environment. This can happen
regardless of the system in question being macroscopic or not. The eﬀect of the environment on some fundamental
behaviors of the system such as the validity of Heisenberg uncertainty relation (HUR) for a given pair of incompatible
observables is an important problem, when other parameters rather than system’s own variables are involved. A
supposed HUR shows the inherent diﬀerence between the classical and the quantum description of states and sets
a limit on the precision of incompatible quantum measurements. As is well-known, the original mathematical form
of HUR for the canonical pair of operators including the position ˆx and the momentum ˆpx with [ˆx, ˆpx] = i, is
∆x2∆p2

Many works have been done to explain the domain of validity of HURs. Anastopoulos and Halliwell studied the
validity of HUR in a class of quantum Brownian motion models consisting of a particle moving in a potential V (x),
coupled to an environment of harmonic oscillators [10]. Ozawa investigated the universally valid reformulation of
the HUR as noise and disturbance in measurement. He showed that the HUR lower bound for the noise-disturbance
product is violated even by a nearly nondisturbing, precise position measuring instrument [11]. The violation of HUR
for two coupled oscillators is also suggested by McDermott and Redmount [12]. Moreover, there have been proposed
other works on HUR and its violation in theoretical and experimental contexts in recent years [13–18].

In our study, instead of using a master equation approach, applied to describe the dynamics of the system under
decoherence, we extend a previously known method [12], in which without any approximation, the stationary states of
a macroscopic quantum harmonic oscillator linearly coupled to an environment containing micro-oscillating degrees of
freedom are obtained analytically. Supposing the conditions under which the proposed open system could be treated
quasi-classically, we calculate the limits of the original uncertainty relation and the vioilation range of it.

The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, the linearly coupled harmonic-environment model for the system

x ≥ 2/4.

2

is introduced and analyzed. Then, the stationary states are exactly evaluated for various numbers of the particles of
the environment. In section 3, the position and the momentum expectation values of the system are calculated for
the corresponding model of the environment, including diﬀerent number of interacting particles. The violation ranges
of the position-momentum HUR are illustrated and discussed, afterwards. Finally, the results are discussed in the
conclusion part.

A TYPICAL FORM OF THE OPEN QUANTUM SYSTEM: HARMONIC MODEL OF THE

ENVIRONMENT

Here, we assume that the central system is a quantum-type harmonic oscillator. The entire system is composed of

We have also assumed that the system is linearly coupled to the environment, as is clear from the term(cid:0) ˆxα − fα( ˆR)(cid:1)2

where α varies from 1 to N, which N is the total number of the environmental oscillators. In relation (2), mα, xα, pα
and ωα denote the mass, the position, the momentum and the frequency of the environmental particles, respectively.
where fα( ˆR) is an arbitrary spatial function of ˆR for the system. We have also included the term − 1

latter convenience.

Now, let us begin with the way one can introduce dimensionless parameters for an arbitrary quantum sysytem [4].
To do this, we deﬁne the characteristic parameters for length R0 and energy U0 as constant units of length and energy,
respectively. Subsequently, for a particle of mass M, one can deﬁne the characteristic time as τ0 = R0/(U0/M) 1
2 .
Since, U0 acts like the kinetic energy of a given system, the unit of momentum could be deﬁned as P0 = (U0M) 1
2 .
Correspondingly, the conjugate variables q and p are deﬁned as q = R/R0 and p = P/P0.

In the dimensionless form, one can use the following classes of Hamiltonian for the system, the environment and

As one can see in (4) and (6), instead of Planck constant , a new dimensionless parameter ¯h appears which rates
quantitavely the quantum nature of the system. Strictly speaking, the situation in which one gets ¯h (cid:28) 1, the system
behaves quasi-classically. The values of ¯h between 0.01 to 0.1 are fair enough to show the macroscopic disposition of
the proposed system [4]. In many applications, R0 is deﬁned as characteristic length of resonance between left and
right counterparts of a double-well potential. So, ¯h in (6) could be also written as:

¯h = λ0/R0

(7)

where λ0 = λ0/2π. Here, λ0 denotes the characteristic wavelength of the central system. For a MQS, λ0 is too
small compared to R0 which is nearly a ﬁxed value for known models of potential. Thus, regarding the quasi-classical
systems, the condition ¯h < 0.1 seems suitable for our future purposes.
Accordingly, for the wave aspect of the system, one can consider another unit of momentum P 0

This is another demonstration of how the value of ¯h can display the classicality of the system. For a MQS, the wave
character is weakened, so that P 0
Hereafter, for simplicity, we assume that fα(q) = γαq where 0 < γα < 1 denotes the strength of the coupling
between the system and the environment. Using the above assumption, one reaches the conclusion that ˆHse is linear
both to ˆxα and ˆq. So, the model is called bilinear. The bilinear assumption is most ﬁtted for the case of limited
numbers of the surrounding particles. As N increases, interactions between the particles of the environment grow and
the bilinear assumption could not be estabilished. For diminished degrees of freedom, however, the approach in this
section is proper enough to show the suppression of the quantum behavior of the system due to the cogency of the
model.

Regarding the bilinear condition, the total form of the Hamiltonian can be provided as:

shows that the particle feels the eﬃcient potential V1(q). Moreover, the main coupling is between each environmental

part, we obtain the stationary eigenfunctions of the total Hamiltonian for the ground state of the entire system.

Consequently, we deﬁne tan2θ = c in (14). If c > 0, then we should have ω2 < ω2

α. This means that

(18)
αγ2N and γα = γ. Yet, in (18), it is necessary that (1 − γ2N) > 0, or N γ2 < 1. So, the number of

particles in the environment should restrict the strength of interaction γ, which is not a legitimate condition. If we
take c < 0, it will result that

(19)
where λα is the wavelength of the environmental particles. For both small values of N and γ (so that 1 − γ2N ≈ 1),
one concludes from (19) that

α

0(1 − γ2N) < λ2
λ2

¯h = λ0/R0 < λα/R0

(20)

which guarantees the quasi-classical behavior of the cantral system. This is because for a MQS, the characteristic
wavelength of the macro-sysytem λ0 is much smaller than the corresponding wavelength λα of the micro-particles of
the environment. We choose 0.01 < ¯h = λ0/R0 < 0.1 to reach the deﬁnite bound of ¯h for a MQS, as mentioned before.
Also, in (19), one can notice that N γ2 > (1 − λ2
0). If one assumes that λα/λ0 < 1 (contrary to (20)), the values
of N and γ will be again restricted to a positive constant value which is not reasonable, since they are independent
parameters. So, for any value of N and 0 < γ < 1, λα/λ0 > 1 and the condition of (20) is compelling. This shows
that under the assumption A, no microscopic quantum system could be a good candidate for our proposed model.
The key point is that the emergence of classicality, here, is due to the conditions that the system interacts with the
environment.

EVALUATING THE VIOLATION RANGE OF POSITION-MOMENTUM UNCERTAINTY RELATION

In the dimensionless regime, HUR for the position and the momentum variances is given by:

where the upper bound of ¯h is given by (20), so that we choose ¯h < 0.1. Considering the assumption A, the general form of
ω+α and ω−α in (16) and (17), neglecting O(γ2), can be written as:

and

(35)
respectively, where a2 + b2 = 1. We also deﬁne d = ω+α/ω−α, where we have supposed that d is the same for any particle of
the environment. Then, one can obtain the following ranges of the violation of (33) for diﬀerent values of N as follows.
For N = 2

ω−α = ωα

0.04 < ¯h < 0.1

For N = 3

0.06 < ¯h < 0.1

For N = 4, the similar calculation gives the folllowing result:

0.08 < ¯h < 0.1

Generally, the lower limit of the violation range is obtained as:

1

N 3πN−1 < ¯hN−1

(37)

(38)

(39)

As an instance, for N = 3, the details of calculations are given in Appendix A.
We have drawn the plots which show the area in which HUR is violated. In these plots, three varying parameters including
¯h, the frequency of the environmental particles ωα and d are considered. As is clear in these ﬁgures, as the number of the
environmental oscillators increases, the area in which the violation of HUR occurs would be smaller (See Fig. 1).

CONCLUSION

For a macroscopic quantum system as described by Leggett [1–3] and others [4, 5], the assumption of macroscopic deﬁniteness
indicates that one can assign distinct states to the macro-system with the property of being in a particular state, even if it is
not observed. Yet, it has not been suggested to what extent, if any, this may inﬂuence the validity of the HUR, when there
is no general form of Heisenberg-type inequalities to include macroscopic systems. Nevertheless, it is a matter of controversy
if such inequalities could be valid in transition from quantum to classical situation. We have instantiated in this paper a
macroscopic quantum harmonic oscillator interacting with various numbers of micro-oscillating particles in the environment.
Taking into account the value of dimensionless parameter ¯h as an indication of the macroscopic disposition of the system (with
an upper bound ¯h < λα/R0), our calculations show that for the quasi-classical systems with 0.04 < ¯h < 0.08, the macroscopic

7

(coloned area) is decrased as N increases.

behavior could be indicated by the violation of position-momentum HUR, when similar limited numbers of the particles of the
environment are in interaction.
On the other hand, when ¯h > λα/R0, and λ0 > λα, we have a micro-system in interaction with the environment. This
situation, however, is unfounded under the condition of similarness of the environmental particles. So, the violation of HUR for
a microscopic quantum system is beyond our consideration. Also, as the number of the particles of the environment increases,
there would appear other factors which could aﬀect the quantum traits of the system. For example, the bilinear assumption
does not hold, when many degrees of freedom in the surrounding are involved, or when the internal interactions between the
particles of the environment could not be ignored.
In such circumstances, the similarity assumption of the environmental
particles is denied and the validity of our result is avoided. For two to four particles, however, the assumptions leading to the
violation seem reasonable. So, it is tenable to show such violations with such simple models. This can shed new light on the
relationship between the classical trait of a system and its quantum uncertainties illustrated by a proper HUR. Here, we have
shown that these two concepts are interrelated.

Appendix A

Here, we derive the violation range of uncertainty relation, when the system is coupled to three particles of the environment.

Considering a given violation range as

where a2 + b2 = 1 and d is deﬁned. The above relation is simpliﬁed to 1/4π2(3)3, after some mathematical manipulation. This
concludes the relation (39) for N = 3. The same method could be used to prove similar results for other Ns.
