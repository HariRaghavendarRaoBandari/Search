Local Extrema of the Ξ(t) Function and

The Riemann Hypothesis

Hisashi Kobayashi∗

2016/03/04

Abstract

In the present paper we obtain a necessary and suﬃcient condition to prove the Riemann hypothesis
in terms of certain properties of local extrema of the function Ξ(t) = ξ( 1
2 + it). First, we prove that
positivity of all local maxima and negativity of all local minima of Ξ(t) form a necessary condition for
the Riemann hypothesis to be true. After showing that any extremum point of Ξ(t) is a saddle point of
the function ℜ{ξ(s)}, we prove that the above properties of local extrema of Ξ(t) are also a suﬃcient
condition for the Riemann hypothesis to hold at t ≫ 1.

We present a numerical example to illustrate our approach towards a possible proof of the Riemann
hypothesis. Thus, the task of proving the Riemann hypothesis is reduced to the one of showing the above
properties of local extrema of Ξ(t).

Key words: Riemann hypothesis, Riemann’s ξ(s) function, product-form representation of ξ(s), Ξ(t)
function, local extema of Ξ(t), saddle points of ℜ{ξ(s)}.

1 Properties of local extrema of Ξ(t) as a necessary condition for

the Riemann hypothesis

We begin with recapitulating some deﬁnitions and relations presented in our earlier paper [3]. Riemann’s
ξ(s) function1 is deﬁned (see e.g., Edwards [1] p. 16) by

where ζ(s) is Riemann’s zeta function deﬁned by

ξ(s) =

s(s − 1)

n−s,

for ℜ(s) > 1,

(2)

which is then extended to the entire domain of the complex variable s = σ + it by analytic continuation (See
Riemann [5] and Edwards [1]).

The function ξ(s) has the product-form representation (see [1], p. 20. also Eqn. (24) of [3]):

In the subsection below, we will derive essential properties of local extrema of Ξ(t) under the assumption
that the Riemann hypothesis is true.

1.1 A necessary condition for the Riemann hypothesis to be true

Let us suppose that the Riemann hypothesis is true, i.e., all zeros of ξ(s) take the form ρn = 1
tn being real. Then, their complex conjugates ρ∗
inﬁnite zeros so that ρ−n = ρ∗

2 + itn, with
2 − itn must be also zeros. We label these countably

where

ξ(s) = gj(s)ξ(j)(s),

ξ(j)(s) = 1

It is shown in Appendix A that ξ(j)(s) can be approximated by the following expression for t ≈ tj:

where αj and γj are constants. Then, the real part of ξ(s) is found to be

ξ(j)(s) = αj(λ2 − t2 + γj + 2itλ),

Theorem 1.1. (Local extrema of the function Ξ(t) and the Riemann hypothesis)

If the Riemann hypothesis is true, local maxima of the function Ξ(t) are all positive, and local minima

are all negative.
Proof. A local extremum of Ξ(t) occurs at t = t∗ such that Ξ′(t∗) = 0. Then, from (16) we ﬁnd that the
following relation holds at all extremum points t∗:

Ξ′′(t∗)
Ξ(t∗)

= −2Xn>0

t∗2 + t2
n
(t∗2 − t2

n)2 < 0,

(18)

which implies that if Ξ(t∗) is a local maximum (i.e., if Ξ′′(t∗) < 0), then Ξ(t∗) > 0. Likewise, if Ξ(t∗) is a
local minimum (i.e., if Ξ′′(t∗) > 0), then Ξ(t∗) < 0. Thus, we have proved the theorem.

It is important to note that the inequality in (18) does not depend on the location of the extremum points
t∗ vis-`a-vis the zeros tn’s. The above lemma asserts that positiveness of all local maxima and negativeness
of all local minima of Ξ(t) form a necessary condition for the Riemann hypothesis to be true.

1.2 An illustrative example
In this subsection, we present some numerical example. Let us consider the range 101 ≤ t ≤ 106, in which
there are three zeros: t30 = 101.3178 . . . , t31 = 103.7255 . . . and t32 = 105.4466 . . .. Figure 1 (a) and (b)
are surface plots of the real and imaginary parts of the function ξ(s) in the critical zone 0 < σ < 1 (or
equivalently − 1
2 (i.e., λ = 0) and the three lines t = t30, t = t31
and t = t32 that pass through these zeros are shown in magenta. The magnitude of the function is in the
order O(10−31) near t = t31, but it rapidly decreases down to O(10−32) and O(10−33) at t = t31 and t = t32,
respectively.

2 ). Here, the critical line σ = 1

2 < λ < 1

In Figure 2 (a), we show a plot of the function Ξ(t), which clearly crosses zero at t30, t31 and t32, and
2 Ξ′′(t) (in green)

local maxima are positive and local minima are negative. In Figure 2 (b), we plot a(t) = − 1
and b(t) = −Ξ′(t) (in red) together with Ξ(t) (in blue).
Figure 3 (a) shows the cross-section of ξ(σ + it30) on the line t = t30 = 101.3178 . . . across the critical
strip 0 < σ < 1 (or − 1
2 ). The parabola (in blue) is the real part, and the straight line (in
red), the imaginary part.
In the ﬁgure (b) we show the real part (in blue) and the imaginary part (in
red) of ξ30(σ + it30), which was calculated by dividing ξ(s) by the 30th factor f30(s) in the product-form
representation (9). The ﬁgure (c) is the real part of the cross-section of the 30th factor, and the ﬁgure (d) is
the imaginary part of this factor. In (d) we plot the real part again in blue, but because it is so small (i.e.,
on the order of O(10−5) compared with the imaginary part, which is (O−2), the blue line is indistinguishable
from the horizontal axis.

2 Properties of local extrema of Ξ(t) as a suﬃcient condition for

the Riemann hypothesis

In this section we shall investigate the inverse of Theorem 1.1. Let us start with the following lemma:

Lemma 2.1. (Local extrema of Ξ(t) and saddle points)

Any extremum point of Ξ(t) is a saddle point of the function ℜ{ξ(s)}.

Proof. Since ξ(s) is a holomorphic function, ℜ{ξ(s)} is a harmonic function. It is known that every critical
point of a harmonic function is a saddle point. To verify this, we apply the so-called discriminant function
test (or the second partial derivative test), which is well known in multivariate calculus, that is, to examine
whether the determinant of the Hessian matrix of ℜ{ξ(s)} evaluated at s = (σ, t) = ( 1
2 , t∗) is negative or
not2:

2 , t∗) = Ξ′′(t∗) ·

D( 1

∂σ2

(19)

The ﬁrst term of the last expression was obtained by applying Laplace’s equation to the function ℜ{ξ(σ, t)},
and the second term was obtained by using the Cauchy-Riemann equation, and this last term is zero because
of (8) in [3]. Hence, we ﬁnd

D( 1

2 , t∗) = −Ξ′′(t∗)2 ≤ 0,

(20)

convex function of σ at ( 1

concave function of σ at the point ( 1

2 , t∗). Thus, this point is a saddle point of the function ξ(s).

If Ξ′(t) crosses zero upward at t = t∗, then Ξ′′(t∗) > 0, and ℜ{ξ(s)} is a convex function of t and a
If Ξ′(t) crosses zero downward at t = t∗, then Ξ′′(t∗) < 0, and ℜ{ξ(s)} is a concave function of t and a
If Ξ′′(t∗) = 0, the point (t∗) is an inﬂection point in both t and σ directions. But since ℜ{ξ(s)} is
symmetric around σ = 1
2 , t∗)} = Ξ(t∗)
for all σ. It then follows that Ξ′′(t∗) = 0, if and only if ℜ{ξ(σ, t∗)} = Ξ(t∗) = 0 for all σ, which is impossible.
Thus, we have shown that all local extremum points of Ξ(t) are saddle points of ℜ{ξ(σ, t)}.

= 0, which implies ℜ{ξ(σ, t∗)} = ℜ{ξ( 1

2 , t∗), which is again a saddle point of ξ(s).

2.1 When the Riemann hypothesis is false

of the form

ρk = 1

2 + λk + itk, and ρ′

k = 1

2 − λk + itk,

product-form expression for the hypothetical ξ-function, denoted ξH (s), can be written as

2 . Then the

2In this section, we often write s = (σ, t) instead of s = σ + it for notational convenience.

As is derived in Appendix A, ξ(k)( 1

2 + λ + itk) can be be given by the following estimate in the vicinity

of t ≈ tk:

ˆξ(k)( 1

2 + λ + itk) = αk(λ2 − t2 + γk + 2itλ),

for t ≈ tk,

(27)

where αk and γk are real constants. This approximation formula could be improved by including higher
order terms λ3 (in the imaginary part) and or λ4 terms (in the real part).

Thus, (23) can be estimated for t ≈ tk by

ˆξH (s) = αk(λ2 − t2 + γk + 2itλ)fk(s),

(28)

from which we see that the real part is an even function of λ and is zero exactly at λ = ±λk, and the
imaginary part is an odd function of λ and is zero at λ = ±λk and λ = 0 (see Appendix B).

By setting λ = 0 in (23), we ﬁnd

Based on what we have found up to this point, we make the following proposition:

Lemma 2.2. (A necessary condition for the Riemann hypothesis to be false)

Suppose that we conjecture that a pair of zeros possibly exist on the line t = tk, together with their complex
conjugates on the line t = −tk. A necessary condition for this conjecture to be true (i.e., for the Riemann
hypothesis to fail) is to show that the value of

is strictly positive.

Ξ′′(tk)
Ξ(tk)

Proof. Suppose Ξ′′(tk) > 0. Then, the function Ξ(t) is a convex function of t in the vicinity of t = tk. From

∂2ℜ{ξ( 1

2 + λ + itk)}
∂λ2

= 2a(tk) = −Ξ′′(tk) < 0, thus the cross-section of ℜ{ξ( 1

2 + λ + itk)}
Laplace’s equation
along t = tk is a concave function of λ, and is a parabola in the range |λ| < 1
2 , with its maximum occurring
at λ = 0. Then, a necessary and suﬃcient condition for this function to become zero at λ = ±λk, is that
the cross-section at λ = 0, which is Ξ(tk), is strictly positive. If Ξ(tk) = 0, then it implies λk = 0, the
degenerated case where the two zeros ±λk reduce to one on the critical line.
If Ξ′′(tk) < 0, the above argument should be modiﬁed by replacing “convex” to “convex,” ”maximum”
to “minimum,” and “positive” to “negative.” In either case, the ratio Ξ′′(tk)/Ξ(tk) must be strictly positive
for the Riemann hypothesis to be rejected.

Unfortunately, Ξ(tk) is neither a local maximum, nor a local minimum, because Ξ′(tk) = −b(tk) 6= 0.
Thus, the above lemma cannot be directly applicable to solving the Riemann hypothesis, since we have no
way of knowing a possible value of tk, even if such tk should exist. As we show in Appendix B, however,
there should always exist a local extremum point t = t∗ = tk − δk, where δk is strictly positive, as given by
(37) below. Thus, we can make the following assertion:

Theorem 2.1. (A suﬃcient condition for the Riemann hypothesis to hold asymptotically)

If local maxima of Ξ(t) are all nonnegative and its local minima are are all non-positive, then the Riemann

hypothesis is asymptotically true, i.e., at t ≫ 1.
Proof. As is derived in Appendix B, for any tk where nontrivial zeros oﬀ the critical line might exist, there
is a point t∗ = tk − δk, which is a local extremum of the real function Ξ(t), where

δk =

Thus, it is clear that

lim
tk→∞

δk = 0.

2.2 The example continued

Let us continue the example of the preceding section. For the sake of a hypothetical example, let us consider
the case k = 30 (i.e., t30 = 101.3178 . . .), and λk = 1

4 , i.e., we have

and their complex conjugates as zeros of ξ(s).

ρ30 =

30 =

4

+ it30,

Figures 4 (a) and (b) are the real and imaginary parts of the factor function f30(s) (25). We ﬁnd that

α30 and γ30 that approximate ξ(30)( 1

2 + λ + it30) plotted earlier in Figure 3 (b) are estimated to be

α30 = −7.0896 × 10−32,

and γ30 = 1.0491 × 104.

Figure 4 (c) is a plot of the function (27) at t = tk, which is hardly distinguishable from the curves of Figure
3 (b). Figure 4(d) is the product of the functions plotted in (a), (b) and (c). Should this hypothetical
cross-section in fact materialize, we clearly see that 1

4 + it30 could be zeros of ξH (s).

4 + it30 and 3

Figure 5 (a) shows Ξ(30)(t) of (26), or the ﬁrst term in the right-hand side (RHS) of (29); Figure 5 (b)
shows fk( 1
2 + it), the second term in RHS of (29); Figure 5 (c) is ΞH (t), the product of the complex functions
plotted in (a) and (b); ﬁnally Figure 5 (d) show a zoomed-in version of ΞH (t) (in blue)(i.e., for the interval
101 ≤ t ≤ 102), and its approximation ˆΞH (t) (in magenta) of Ξ(30)(t) obtained by using the approximation
(27). A local maximum close to t30 = 101.3178 . . . is found from (37) at

t∗ = t30 − δ30 = 101.3178 −

3λ2
30
2t30

= 101.3178 − 9.2531 × 10−4 = 101.3169.

From Figure 5(c) (and its zoomed-in version (d)), we see that the function Ξ(t) takes its local maximum at
t∗ ≈ t30. Its value ΞH (t∗) is strictly negative ≈ −0.4, as seen from both (c) and (d), as well as from Figure
4(d), where it is a local minimum of the cross-section across λ or σ. This negativity of the local maximum
is conﬁrmed by evaluating (31), (33) and (36):

3 Concluding Remarks

In this paper we have presented a new and promising direction towards a possible proof of the Riemann
hypothesis, i.e., to show that all local maxima of Ξ(t) are positive and all local minima are negative. A
further investigation along this line of argument will be reported in a forthcoming paper.

(A.1)

Let us consider the following three diﬀerent regimes:
1. tn ≫ t ≈ tj: There are inﬁnitely many such tn’s, but each term of the product form (A.1) can be

approximated by a real constant, which converges to 1 as tn → ∞:

For instance, for t ≈ t10 = 49.7738 . . . (i.e., j = 10), the term contributed by n = 30 (where t30 =
101.3178 . . .) can be approximated by a real constant: the real part of the above expression is ≈ 0.76,
and the imaginary part is within ±5 × 10−3. For n = 100 (t100 = 236.7818 . . .), the real part is ≈ 0.96
and the imaginary part is much smaller, i.e., within the range of ±0.9 × 10−3 for |λ| < 1
2 .
If we set j = 30, the term contributed by n = 50 or t50 = 143.1118 have its real part ≈ 0.5 and the
imaginary part within ±5 × 10−3. The term due to n = 200, or t200 = 396.3818, has the real part
≈ 0.93 and the imaginary part within ±6.4 × 10−4.

2. tn ∼ t ≈ tj: Since the distance between two adjacent zeros is on the order of O(1), λ2 is negligibly

smaller than the rest of the terms. Thus,

By setting an(t) =

n − t2 , each term is proportional to (1 − ian(t)λ), where an(t) = O(t−1) ≪ 1.

Then, the following formula
(1 + ia1λ)(1 + ia2λ) = 1 − a1a2λ2 + i(a1 + a2)λ,
(1 + ia1λ)(1 + ia2λ)(1 + ia3λ) = 1 − (a1a2 + a2a3 + a3a1)λ2 + a1a2a3λ4 + i[(a1 + a2 + a3)λ − a1a2a3λ3],

Since an ≪ 1 it is clear that the real and imaginary parts of the product can be approximated by a
quadratic function and a linear function of λ, respectively.

where in the last expression we dropped the imaginary part because t ≫ t1 ≫ 1
2 > |λ|. In this case,
the imaginary part is much smaller than the real part. In the case of j = 30 (i.e., t30 = 101.3178 . . .,
the term for n = 1 (t1 = 14.1347 . . .) contributes ≈ −5.0 ± i0.5, which means that the real part is
constant -50 and the imaginary part is a straight line whose maximum is 0.5 at λ = 1
2 . Similarly we
ﬁnd that the term for n = 10 (i.e., t10 = 49.7738 . . .) contributes ≈ −3.15 ± i0.04. For n = 20 (i.e.,
t20 = 77.1448) the contribution to the product form is ≈ −0.33 ± i0.017. The magnitude of the real
part is less than one: this is because the last approximation in (A.4) does not hold, because tn ≪ tj
does not hold, although tn < tj. Nevertheless, this term still contributes as a multiplying real constant
in the range |λ| < 1, since the imaginary part is smaller by more than two orders of magnitude.

From the above results, we can conclude that each term in the product form expression (A.1) is a real
constant (< 1) when tn ≫ t (i.e., Case 1); it is a negative constant, whose magnitude is greater than unity,
when tn ≪ t (i.e., Case 3). Consequently, the functional form of ξj( 1
2 + λ + it) of (A.1) is dictated by a ﬁnite
number of terms whose tn values are not far from t (i.e., Case 2). It is not diﬃcult to see that a holomorphic
function whose cross section along t = tj has a quadratic function in its real part and a straight line in its
imaginary part that cuts through zero is limited to the following function

αj(λ2 − t2 + γj + 2itλ).

(A.5)

where αj and γj are real constants. It is not diﬃcult to see that this function satisﬁes the Cauchy-Riemann
equations, and Laplace’s equation. Furthermore, the function is reﬂective, just like ξ(s) and (s− ρj)(s− ρj ′ ).
If we should include λ4 and higher-order terms in the real part, and λ3 and nigher order terms in the
imaginary part, we could certainly improve the approximation, but for the purpose of our analysis, such
generalization would merely complicate the analysis and would not contribute to any additional insight into
the heart of the problem we are interested in.

On the critical line λ = 0, each term in the product representation (10) is given by

Hence, the function ξ(j)(s) is real on the critical line, and we denote it by Ξ∗

Appendix B: Derivation of an extremum point near t = tk in the

function Ξ(t)

When the imaginary part of the cross section ξ( 1
2 + λ + itk) crosses zero at λ = −λk, 0 and λk for some λk
such that 0 < λk < 1
2 , which is a necessary condition to disprove the Riemann hypothesis, the slope b(t)
at t = tk is not zero. In other words, t = tk is not an extremum point of the real function Ξ(t). In this
appendix we derive an extremum point which is close to t = tk.

By applying the result obtained in Appendix A, we ﬁnd that the ξ(k)(s) takes the following form for

tk ≫ 1:

ξ(k)( 1

2 + λ + itk) = αk(λ2 − t2 + γk + 2itλ),

for t ≈ tk,

where αk and γk are real constants. Thus, we have

ξ(s) = t−4

k [λ2 − λ2

k − (t − tk)2 + i2(t − tk)λ] · [λ2 − λ2

k − (t + tk)2 + i2(t + tk)λ] · αk(λ2 − t2 + γk + 2itλ).

The imaginary part of the above function is

b(λ, tk) = 0 (see (36) in [3]), are at λ = ±

.

λk√3

By taking the partial derivative of the above equation w.r.t. λ and setting λ = 0, we ﬁnd

b(t) = 2αkt−4

k t(cid:8)2(λ2

k + t2 − t2

k)(t2 − γk) + [λ2

k + (t − tk)2][λ2

k + (t + tk)2](cid:9) .

We should note that the above result can be alternatively derived from Ξ(t), using the formulas (6). The
function Ξ(t) can be simply obtained by setting λ = 0 in (23). The value of b(t) at t = tk can be obtained as

b(tk) = 2αkλ2

(B.5)

which is clearly not zero, although it converges to zero as tk → ∞.

In order to ﬁnd t∗ in the vicinity of tk such that b(t∗) = −Ξ′(t∗) = 0, we set (B.4) to zero, obtaining

k − γk)t2 + 2γk(t2
from which we ﬁnd the extremum point that we are after:

From Lemma 2.1 we know that s = 1

2 + it∗ is a saddle point. Thus, Ξ(t) can be approximated by a

quadratic function around t = t∗, i.e.,

Thus,

Ξ(t) = −a(t∗)(t − t∗)2 + ··· ,

for t ≈ t∗.

Ξ(tk) − Ξ(t∗) = −a(t∗)δ2
