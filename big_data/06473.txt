Singular ferromagnetic susceptibility of the transverse-ﬁeld Ising antiferromagnet on

the triangular lattice

A transverse magnetic ﬁeld Γ is known to induce antiferromagnetic three-sublattice order of the
Ising spins σz in the triangular lattice Ising antiferromagnet at low enough temperature. This low-
temperature order is known to melt on heating in a two-step manner, with a power-law ordered inter-
mediate temperature phase characterized by power-law correlations at the three-sublattice wavevec-
tor Q: (cid:104)σz( (cid:126)R)σz(0)(cid:105) ∼ cos(Q · (cid:126)R)/| (cid:126)R|η(T ) with the temperature-dependent power-law exponent
η(T ) ∈ (1/9, 1/4). Here, we use a newly developed quantum cluster algorithm to study the ferro-
magnetic easy-axis susceptibility χu(L) of an L × L sample in this power-law ordered phase. Our
numerical results are consistent with a recent prediction of a singular L dependence χu(L) ∼ L2−9η
when η(T ) is in the range (1/9, 2/9). This ﬁnite-size result implies, via standard scaling arguments,
that the ferromagnetic susceptibility χu(B) to a uniform ﬁeld B along the easy axis is singular at
intermediate temperatures in the small B limit, χu(B) ∼ |B|− 4−18η
4−9η for η(T ) ∈ (1/9, 2/9), although
there is no ferromagnetic long-range order in the low temperature state.

the deﬁnition of J1), and B and Γ are components of the
external magnetic ﬁeld along the easy axis ˆz and trans-
verse direction ˆx respectively (a factor of gµB
2 , appropri-
ate for S = 1/2 moments, has been absorbed in the def-
inition of these ﬁeld components), provides perhaps the
simplest example of a quantum “order-by-disorder”1,2 ef-
fect, whereby a classical spin liquid develops long-range
magnetic order upon the introduction of terms in the
Hamiltonian that induce quantum ﬂuctuations.

When Γ = 0, the zero temperature classical Ising an-
tiferromagnet at B = 0 has a macroscopic degeneracy
of minimum exchange-energy conﬁgurations on the tri-
angular lattice. These are in correspondence with all
dimer covers of the dual honeycomb lattice,
implying
that the entropy-density remains nonzero in this clas-
sical zero temperature limit.3,4 At non-zero temperature,
thermal ﬂuctuations of σz allow for defects that take the
system out of the minimum exchange-energy dimer sub-
space. The Ising spins remain in a paramagnetic state
all the way down to T = 0,3,4 albeit with a diverging
correlation length5 at the three-sublattice wavevector Q.
This provides a simple example of classical spin liquid
behaviour, with the T = 0 limit characterized by power-

law spin correlations at the three-sublattice wavevector
Q.

A transverse ﬁeld Γ that couples to σx induces quan-
tum ﬂuctuations of the Ising spins σz, and would or-
dinarily be expected to further reduce any residual or-
dering tendency of the Ising spins. However, in real-
ity, these quantum ﬂuctuations immediately stabilize a
ground-state with long-range three-sublattice order of
σz for any nonzero Γ. In contrast to the ferrimagnetic
three-sublattice order exhibited by the classical Ising
antiferromagnet with ferromagnetic further neighbour
couplings6, the Γ > 0 ground state is characterized by
antiferromagnetic three-sublattice order,7 i.e., the mod-
ulation of (cid:104)σz(cid:105) at wavevector Q is not accompanied by
any net ferromagnetic moment. At T = 0, this three-
sublattice ordered persists up to a critical value Γc ≈ 1.77
(in units of J1), beyond which the system becomes a
quantum paramagnet in which the spins are polarized
in the ˆx direction.2,7,8 When the system is heated to
nonzero temperatures above this three-sublattice ordered
ground state, the three-sublattice order melts via an
intermediate-temperature phase characterized by power-
law order: (cid:104)σz( (cid:126)R)σz(0)(cid:105) ∼ cos(Q · (cid:126)R)/| (cid:126)R|η(T ) for T ∈
(T1, T2), with a temperature-dependent power-law expo-
nent η(T ) that is expected9 to increase from η(T1) = 1/9
to η(T2) = 1/4.7

A recent ﬁeld-theoretical analysis10 predicts that the
ferromagnetic easy-axis susceptibility χu(B) to the uni-
form longitudinal ﬁeld B along the easy-axis diverges at
small B in a large portion of such power-law ordered
phases associated with the two-step melting of three-
sublattice order in frustrated easy-axis antiferromagnets
− 4−18η
4−9η
with triangular lattice symmetry: χu(B) ∼ |B|
for η(T ) ∈ (1/9, 2/9). For the speciﬁc case of the trans-
verse ﬁeld Ising antiferromagnet on the triangular lattice,
this is a rather counter-intuitive prediction: The Ising
spins in Eq. (1) have no ferromagnetic couplings, and

ferromagnetic correlations remain short-ranged in the
low-temperature phase with long-range three-sublattice
ordered phase. Yet, the prediction is for the uniform
easy-axis susceptibility to start diverging once this three-
sublattice order melts partially due to thermal ﬂuctua-
tions.

Our goal here is to test this general prediction using
the test-bed provided by the transverse ﬁeld Ising anti-
ferromagnet (Eq. (1)) on the triangular lattice. In order
to do this, we need to obtain an accurate characteriza-
tion of the long-distance form of the correlations of the
easy-axis magnetization density as well as correlations
of the three-sublattice order parameter for this model.
These can be used to obtain the ﬁnite-size easy-axis sus-
ceptibility χu(L) of the Ising spins, as well as the value
of η(T ) for a range of temperatures in the power-law or-
dered phase. If the easy-axis susceptibility is indeed sin-
gular as predicted, then standard ﬁnite-size scaling argu-

ments imply that χu(L) ∼ L2−9η for η(T ) ∈ (1/9, 2/9) in

the power-law ordered phase. In this paper, we test this
form of the prediction using a newly developed quantum-
cluster algorithm11 that provides an eﬃcient tool for per-
forming Quantum Monte Carlo simulations of frustrated
transverse ﬁeld Ising models within the Stochastic Series
Expansion12,13 framework.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows:

In
Section. II, we discuss the antiferromagnetic nature of
the three-sublattice order induced by the transverse ﬁeld
and contrast it with the ferrimagnetic three-sublattice
ordered phase established by additional ferromagnetic
couplings. We also review the standard Landau the-
ory framework used for describing this kind of long-
range order, and use it to discuss the possible theoret-
ical scenarios for the phase transition between these two
phases. In Section. III we provide a brief sketch of the
actual computational method used to obtain our numer-
ical results. In Section. IV, we summarize our results for
the uniform magnetization density as well as the three-
sublattice order parameter and compare them with the
ﬁeld-theoretical predictions alluded to earlier.

II. PHASES AND TRANSITIONS

The antiferromagnetic (with no net easy-axis magnetic
moment) three-sublattice order exhibited by the Γ > 0
ground state of HIsing can be thought of in terms of the
following useful caricature: Ising spins on one sponta-
neously chosen sublattice (out of the three sublattices
corresponding to the natural tripartite decomposition of
the triangular lattice) freeze into the |σx = +1(cid:105) state.
Equivalently, one may think of them as ﬂuctuating freely
between the |σz = +1(cid:105) and |σx = −1(cid:105) states due to the
eﬀects of quantum ﬂuctuations. On the other two sub-
lattices of the triangular lattice, the system orders anti-
ferromagnetically, with spins on one sublattice pointing
up along the ˆz axis, and spins on the other sublattice
pointing down. This is also the picture for the long-

2

range ordered phase that persists up to the lower-critical
temperature T1(Γ) that marks the onset of the power-law
ordered intermediate phase associated with the two-step
melting of three-sublattice order.

On incorporating an additional next-neighbour ferro-
magnetic coupling J2 < 0, the antiferromagnetic three-
sublattice order of the low-temperature phase gives way
to ferrimagnetic (with net easy axis moment) three-
sublattice order beyond a non-zero threshold value J2c.11
This is because the classical (Γ = 0) model with J2 < 0 is
known to develop ferrimagnetic three-sublattice order be-
yond a T = 0 threshold at which σz have power-law cor-
relators (cid:104)σz( (cid:126)R)σz(0)(cid:105) ∼ cos(Q · (cid:126)R)/|R|η with η = 1/9.14
This ferrimagnetic three-sublattice order can be under-
stood in terms of the following caricature: The system
spontaneously chooses one sublattice on which the spins
all point along the +ˆz direction (−ˆz direction), while the
spins on the other two sublattices all point along the −ˆz
direction (+ˆz direction).

With this picture of the low temperature phases in
mind, we focus our attention on the uniform easy axis
magnetization m and the complex three-sublattice order
parameter ψ, deﬁned as

In
the standard Landau-Ginzburg approach15–17 to ther-
mal (nonzero temperature) phase transitions involving
such three-sublattice ordered states, the physics of three-
sublattice ordering is represented in terms of a classical
order parameter ﬁeld ψcl, which may be identiﬁed with

In this Landau-Ginzburg framework, the free energy is
written as an integral over a coarse-grained free-energy
density F(ψcl) that admits an expansion in powers and
gradients of a coarse-grained order-parameter ﬁeld ψcl((cid:126)r)
which may be thought of as a local version of the order
parameter deﬁned in Eq. 4. Keeping various low-order
terms consistent with the action of various symmetries

of the microscopic Hamiltonian, one writes:

relation η(T ) = g(T ).

F(ψcl) = κ|∇ψcl|2 + r|ψcl|2 + u4|ψcl|4
+u6|ψcl|6 + λ6|ψcl|6 cos(6θ)
+λ12|ψcl|12 cos(12θ) + . . .

(5)

where, θ((cid:126)r) is the phase of the complex order parameter
ﬁeld ψcl((cid:126)r). As usual, one assumes that the coeﬃcients
of various terms in this phenomenological free-energy are
smooth functions of microscopic parameters. In this ap-
proach, three-sublattice ordering corresponds to r < 0.
The sign of λ6 determines the nature of three-sublattice
ordering : λ6 > 0 favors antiferromagnetic ordering with
the phase θ pinned at (2n + 1)π/6 (n = 0, 1 . . . 5), while
λ6 < 0 favors ferrimagnetic ordering with the phase
pinned at (2n)π/6 (n = 0, 1 . . . 5). The λ12 term is not
expected to be important except when λ6 is driven to
the vicinity of zero by the competition between further-
neighbour ferromagnetic couplings ( in the microscopic
Hamiltonian ) that favour ferrimagnetic three-sublattice
ordering, and other eﬀects (such as quantum ﬂuctuations
induced by a transverse ﬁeld) that favour antiferromag-
netic three-sublattice ordering.

If ﬂuctuations of θ, the phase of the order parameter,
play a dominant role in driving the transition to a para-
magnetic high-temperature state, one expects a phase-
only description to capture the long-wavelength proper-
ties near such a transition.
In other words, one then
expects that |ψcl|, the amplitude of the order parameter,
remains nonzero near the transition (corresponding to
r < 0), and the physics of the transition is controlled by
the interplay between the eﬀective phase-stiﬀness κ|ψcl|2
and the six-fold anisotropy λ6. This gives rise to the
expectation15–17 of critical behaviour in the universality
class of the six-state clock model9,18,19 of statistical me-
chanics.

As is well-known, two-dimensional six-state clock mod-
els represent an unusual example of a system which
can display a variety of critical behaviours, each of
which is a generic possibility that can be realized for a
range of microscopic parameters.19 Of particular inter-
est in the present context is the possibility of a two-step
melting transition, whereby the low-temperature phase
with long-range order in exp(iθ) is separated from a
high-temperature paramagnetic phase by an intermedi-
ate phase with power-law order in exp(iθ). As is well
known, this power-law ordered phase is controlled by a
line of Gaussian ﬁxed points9 with eﬀective free-energy
density
fold anisotropy λ6 and the vorticity in the xy ﬁeld θ
are both irrelevant perturbations of this ﬁxed-point free-
energy density, which controls the long-wavelength be-
haviour of order parameter correlations in the intermedi-
ate power-law ordered phase. The continuously varying
power-law exponent η(T ) for order parameter correla-
tions, which serves as a “universal coordinate” that lo-
cates a given microscopic system within this power-law
ordered phase, is set by the coupling constant g via the

(cid:82) d2r(∇θ)2. For g ∈ (1/9, 1/4), the six-

4πg

The Landau-Ginzburg theory also sheds light on the
nature of the low temperature transition between the two
kinds of three-sublattice ordered phases, modeled by λ6
going through zero smoothly and changing sign. Since
both phases have long-range three-sublattice order, ﬂuc-
tuations of |ψcl| may again be neglected in the vicinity
of this transition. With the amplitude |ψcl| remaining
essentially constant across this transition, the physics of
the transition is again controlled by the phase θ of the
three-sublattice order parameter. Minimizing the free-
energy density F yields a spatially uniform conﬁguration
with a particular optimal value θ∗ for this phase vari-
able. When λ12 < 0, θ∗ takes on the values (2n + 1)π/6
((2n)π/6) with n = 0, 1 . . . 5 when λ6 > 0 (λ6 < 0 ).
When λ6 = 0, all values θ∗ = mπ/6 (m = 0, 1 . . . 11)
minimize the free-energy. Clearly, this corresponds to
a ﬁrst-order transition between ferrimagnetic and anti-
ferromagnetic three-sublattice ordered states, with both
kinds of three-sublattice order coexisting at the transi-
tion point.

If, on the other hand, λ12 > 0, we obtain

comes small and λ6 goes through zero, θ∗ switches con-
tinuously from the antiferromagnetic phase to the fer-
rimagnetic phase via an intermediate mixed phase that
is established for |λ6| < 4λ12|ψcl|6. In what follows, we
will confront these two quite diﬀerent scenarios with data
obtained in the vicinity of the transition between antifer-
romagnetic and ferrimagnetic three-sublattice order in
the low-temperature state of HIsing with an additional
ferromagnetic second-neighbour coupling J2 between the
Ising spins.

III. METHODS

Our numerical work uses the Stochastic Series Ex-
pansion (SSE) framework12,13,20–22 to compute equilib-
rium averages (cid:104). . .(cid:105) for transverse ﬁeld Ising models at
nonzero temperature. For models with geometric frus-
tration, which results in a macroscopic degeneracy of
minimally frustrated classical conﬁgurations (with min-
imum Ising-exchange energy), it is important that the
computational method correctly captures the interplay
between this macroscopic degeneracy, and the disorder-
ing eﬀects of classical and quantum ﬂuctuations. In the
present case, this interplay is expected to be crucial to
the establishment of antiferromagnetic three-sublattice
order in the low temperature phase, as well as its two-
step melting.2,7,8

FIG. 1. The uniform easy-axis susceptibility χu of HIsing on
L × L triangular lattices, when plotted vs 1/L for a sequence
of sizes, clearly saturates to a ﬁnite value in the limit of large
L. Note the slow crossover to this thermodynamic limit, with
∗
samples of linear size as large as L
= 40 not yet in the asymp-
totic large-L regime. This behaviour demonstrates that the
low temperature phase is indeed antiferromagnetic. However,
the slow crossover indicates the presence of a proximate phase
with net magnetic moment along the easy-axis, suggesting
that HIsing could be driven into a ferrimagnetic ground state
for relatively small values of an additional second-neighbour
ferromagnetic coupling J2. All other temperature and energy
scales are measured in units of J1 which is set to unity.

is ﬁt reasonably well to the single parameter form kL
k = 15.18(8) for the largest four sizes studied here. This anal-
ysis also conﬁrms that the low temperature phase of HIsing is
indeed antiferromagnetic, i.e. with no net easy-axis moment.
All other temperature and energy scales are measured in units
of J1 which is set to unity.

Therefore, to obtain reliable results, we use the re-
cently developed quantum cluster algorithm11 that works
within the SSE framework to provide an eﬃcient way of
sampling the partition function for such frustrated trans-
verse ﬁeld Ising models. In this cluster algorithm, which
works in the σz basis, the diagonal Ising exchange part of

HIsing in Eq. (??) is written as Hdiag =(cid:80)(cid:52) H(cid:52), where

H(cid:52) are operators living on elementary triangular plaque-
ttes (cid:52). This furnishes the algorithm local information
that enables it to distinguish between minimally frus-
trated plaquettes and fully frustrated plaquettes of higher
Ising-exchange energy. The transverse ﬁeld part of the
Hamiltonian is represented as single-site operators as in
the original SSE approach.13 The plaquette representa-
tion of Hdiag facilitates the construction of “space-time
clusters” with a broad distribution of cluster sizes, allow-
ing the algorithm to eﬃciently sample the conﬁguration
space of SSE operator strings at low temperature.

Using this approach, we study HIsing on L × L trian-
gular lattice with periodic boundary conditions, with L
ranging from L = 24 to 96. We compute the static sus-
ceptibilities corresponding to the order parameters de-
ﬁned in Eq. (2). These susceptibilities are deﬁned as

IV. RESULTS

We begin by revisiting the phase diagram obtained in
previous work7 for the case with no next-nearest neigh-
bour coupling (J2 = 0). From their results, we note that
the low temperature order persists up to the highest tem-
perature when Γ is in the vicinity of Γ = 0.8. Therefore,
we set the transverse ﬁeld to this value in most of our
work and study the three-sublattice ordering of the low
temperature phase, as well as its two-step melting.

As expected, we ﬁnd that the order parameter sus-
ceptibility χQ scales with the volume of the system
at low enough temperature, conﬁrming the presence of
long-range three-sublattice order in the low tempera-
ture phase. Since this is entirely consistent with earlier
results,7 we do not display this explicitly here. Since
our focus in what follows will be an unusual singular be-
haviour in the ferromagnetic susceptibility χu to a uni-
form ﬁeld along the easy-axis, we ﬁnd it useful to ﬁrst
study the same quantity deep in the low-temperature or-
dered state. From Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, which display the L
dependence of χu and χu/L2 deep in the low-temperature
ordered state, we see that the three-sublattice ordering
in the low temperature phase is not accompanied by any
net moment along the easy-axis.

This conﬁrms earlier results7 that have identiﬁed the
antiferromagnetic nature of the three-sublattice order-
ing at low temperature. However, the approach to the
thermodynamic limit is seen to involve a slow crossover,
suggesting the presence of a proximate phase with a net
easy-axis moment. This is consistent with the fact that
a relatively small value of second-neighbour ferromag-
netic exchange J2 < 0 is suﬃcient to access a nearby
state with ferrimagnetic three-sublattice ordering at low
temperature.11

In the power-law ordered phase associated with the
two-step melting of three-sublattice order, the static sus-
ceptibility χQ, deﬁned in Eq. (8) for a ﬁnite size L × L
system, is expected to scale as

other temperature and energy scales are measured in units of

of transitions obtained in this way are consistent with
those obtained earlier in Ref. 7.

Since the upper (lower) transitions out of the power-
law ordered phase correspond to vorticity (six-fold
anisotropy) in θ becoming relevant, we expect these
transitions to be of the Kosterlitz-Thouless (inverted
Kosterlitz-Thouless) type. To conﬁrm that this is indeed
the case, we perform ﬁts of our Quantum Monte Carlo
data in the vicinity of the upper phase boundary to the
ﬁnite-size scaling form predicted by Kosterlitz-Thouless
theory.18 This scaling form follows from the following ar-
gument: Above T2(Γ), order parameter correlations de-
cay exponentially, with a correlation length ξ given by23

ξ ∼ exp(at

−1/2) ,

(12)

where t = (T − T2)/T2 is the reduced temperature.
This Kosterlitz-Thouless form of the correlation length,
Eq. (12), in conjunction with the standard ﬁnite size scal-
ing ansatz χQ(t, L) = L2−η2 f (ξ/L) gives the ﬁnite-size
scaling form18

χQ ∼ L2−η(T )

(13)

From the renormalization group picture (summarized in
the previous section) of this power-law ordered phase, it
is also clear that η(T ) ranges from η(T1) = 1/9 at the
lower phase boundary T1(Γ) of the power-law phase, to
η(T2) = 1/4 at the upper phase boundary T2(Γ).

To locate these upper and lower transition tempera-
4−2 for vari-
tures for Γ = 0.8, we plot χQL
ous sizes L as a function of temperature and identify the
temperature at which curves corresponding to the diﬀer-
ent sizes all cross. This is shown in Fig. 3. The location

threshold value of J2 corresponding to this onset of fer-
rimagnetism was estimated to be roughly J2c ≈ −0.03.
With a view towards comparing the melting behaviour
of this ferrimagnetic three-sublattice order with the two-
step melting of antiferromagnetic three-sublattice or-
der, we also study the eﬀect of thermal ﬂuctuations at
J2 = −0.1, i.e. deep in this ferrimagnetic three-sublattice
ordered state. We ﬁnd that long-range order is again
lost via a two-step melting process, with an intermedi-
ate power-law ordered phase. The locations of the upper
and lower transitions that demarcate the extent of the
power-law ordered phase are obtained as before. This is
displayed in Fig. 5. Above T2, the static order param-
eter susceptibility again collapses quite convincingly on
to the Kosterlitz-Thouless ﬁnite-size scaling form. This
is shown in Fig. 6.

With these preliminaries out of the way, we are now
in a position to study in a uniﬁed way the behaviour
of the uniform easy-axis susceptibility χu in the power-
law ordered phase associated with the two-step melting
of antiferromagnetic three-sublattice order as well as fer-
rimagnetic three-sublattice order. As mentioned earlier,
our goal is to test a recent prediction10 that χu provides a
thermodynamic signature of two step melting due to the
− 4−18η

presence of a singular B dependence: χu(B) ∼ |B|
for η(T ) ∈ (1/9, 2/9).
Here, we test this via the equivalent prediction10 for
the ﬁnite-size susceptibility χu(L) of an L × L sample
when B = 0: χu(L) ∼ L2−9η for η(T ) ∈ (1/9, 2/9). In
Landau theory terms, this singularity in χu is a direct

mcl|ψcl|3 cos(3θ) between the static component mcl((cid:126)r) of
the uniform magnetization density and the order param-
eter ﬁeld ψcl. In the power-law ordered phase, this cou-
pling is predicted10 to cause mcl to have the same power-
law correlations as cos(3θ), leading to a singular χu inde-
pendent of whether the low temperature ordered state is
ferrimagnetic or antiferromagnetic. Thus, while the pre-
dicted eﬀect is particularly counter-intuitive for the anti-
ferromagnetic case, i.e with J2 = 0 for the system under

lar ﬁts in Fig. 8 for the same quantities in the power-
law ordered phase associated with the two-step melting
of ferrimagnetic three-sublattice order. As is clear from
these results, the uniform susceptibility does indeed pro-
vide a thermodynamic signature of the power-law ordered

Finally, we comment on the nature of the transition be-
tween the antiferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic three sub-
lattice ordered states. In previous work which studied11
relatively small samples at moderately low temperatures
in the vicinity of this transition, the phase of the esti-
mator for the three-sublattice order parameter, as mea-
sured in the Quantum Monte Carlo simulations, was seen
to be distributed more or less uniformly in the interval
(0, 2π). If this behaviour were to persist to larger sizes,
it would be indicative of a power-law ordered phase that
interpolates between the antiferromagnetic and ferrimag-
netic three-sublattice ordered phases at nonzero temper-
ature. However, from the Landau theory considerations
of Sec. II, we see that the two generic possibilities for this
phase transition are ﬁrst-order behaviour, or an interme-
diate mixed-phase. An intervening power-law ordered
phase can, in this picture, only arise in the ﬁne-tuned
limiting case where λ12 and higher order anisotropies are
all absent. With this in mind, we measure the histogram
of the estimator for χu/L2 to look for signals of phase
coexistence in the transition region. These histograms
are shown in Fig. 10. The two-peak nature of these his-
tograms suggests that the transition is in fact of a weakly
ﬁrst-order type. This is consistent with the fact that the
L-dependence of χQ is certainly not a power-law, and
the fact that Binder ratios of the estimator of χQ also
do not show a clear crossing (indicative of a second-order

power-law ordered phase).18 However, we do not see any
indications of non-monotonic Binder ratios26 of the type
expected in the vicinity of ﬁrst order transitions. Thus,
while our data is suggestive of a weakly ﬁrst-order tran-
sition, more work is needed to clarify the precise nature
of this transition.

V. DISCUSSION

Thus, we have obtained fairly convincing evidence for
a singular uniform easy-axis susceptibility χu(B) in the
power-law ordered phase associated with the two-step
melting of antiferromagnetic three-sublattice order in tri-
angular lattice transverse-ﬁeld Ising antiferromagnets.
This (at-ﬁrst-sight) counter-intuitive thermodynamic sig-
nature of two-step melting is already of some general in-
terest, since the transverse-ﬁeld Ising antiferromagnet on
the triangular lattice is a paradigmatic example of the
interplay between quantum ﬂuctuations and frustrated
classical interactions. Of course, this thermodynamic
signature of two-step melting would be of much greater
interest and direct experimental relevance if the model
Hamiltonian HIsing were to emerge as a good descrip-
tion of magnetic exchange interactions in some frustrated
magnet.

In this context,

it should be noted that a closely
related model Hamiltonian, the one-dimensional trans-
verse ﬁeld Ising chain, does serve as a good start-
ing point for the theoretical description of an interest-

ing quantum phase transition in the magnetic material
Columbite.27–29 Columbite can be thought of as a trian-
gular array of one dimensional chains of magnetic mo-
ments, with strong intra-chain coupling between the mo-
ments and weak inter-chain couplings. This hierarchy
of exchange-couplings allows for a theoretical description
in terms of the quantum critical properties of the one-
dimensional transverse-ﬁeld Ising chain.
It is possible
that other materials, with somewhat diﬀerent exchange
pathways but the same strong easy-axis anisotropy, may
have much stronger exchange couplings within a trian-
gular plane, and much weaker couplings between planes.
For such a material, the model Hamiltonian HIsing could
in the same way serve as a good theoretical description,
and our results on this thermodynamic signature of two-
step melting could then be of direct experimental rele-
vance. We hope that our results provide some motivation
for exploring this possibility.
