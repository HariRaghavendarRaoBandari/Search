Two dimensional tensor networks such as projected entangled pairs states (PEPS) are generally
hard to contract. This is arguably the main reason why variational tensor network methods in 2D
are still not as successful as in 1D. However, this is not necessarily the case if the tensor network
represents a gapped ground state of a local Hamiltonian; such states are subject to many constraints
and contain much more structure. In this paper we introduce a new approach for approximating the
expectation value of a local observable in ground states of local Hamiltonians that are represented
as PEPS tensor-networks. Instead of contracting the full tensor-network, we try to estimate the
expectation value using only a local patch of the tensor-network around the observable. Surprisingly,
we demonstrate that this is often easier to do when the system is frustrated.
In such case, the
spanning vectors of the local patch are subject to non-trivial constraints that can be utilized via a
semi-deﬁnite program to calculate rigorous lower- and upper-bounds on the expectation value. We
test our approach in 1D systems, where we show how the expectation value can be calculated up to
at least 3 or 4 digits of precision, even when the patch radius is smaller than the correlation length.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Variational tensor-network methods [1] provide a
promising way for understanding the low-temperature
physics of many-body condensed matter systems. In par-
ticular, they seem suitable for studying the ground states
of highly frustrated systems, where the sign problem lim-
its many of the quantum Monte Carlo approaches. The
best-known and by far the most successful tensor-network
method is the Density Matrix Renormalization Group
(DMRG) algorithm [2, 3]. It has revolutionized our abil-
ity to numerically probe strongly correlated systems in
1D, often providing results up to machine-precision. To-
day, it is generally believed to be the optimal method for
ﬁnding ground states of 1D lattice models.

DMRG can be viewed as a variational algorithm for
minimizing the energy of the system over the manifold
of Matrix Product States (MPS) [4, 5], which are spe-
cial types of tensor-network with linear, 1D structure. In
2D and beyond several generalizations of this approach
are possible. Arguably the most natural generalization
is Projected Entangled Pairs State (PEPS) tensor net-
work [6, 7], which was introduced by Verstraete and Cirac
in 2004 [6], and is the main tensor-network we shall con-
sider in this paper. Other constructions include Tree Ten-
sor Networks [8], Multi-scale Entanglement Renormal-
ization ansatz (MERA) [9], String bond states [10], and
recently introduced Projected Entangled Simplex States
(PESS) [11], to name a few. These tensor-networks
have proven a vital theoretical tool for understanding the
physics of 2D lattice systems and in particular their en-
tanglement structure. However, as a numerical method
for studying highly frustrated 2D systems, they still face
substantial challenges which limit their applicability. In
most cases, the best results are still obtained either by

DMRG, in which a 1D MPS wraps around the 2D sur-
face, or by quantum Monte Carlo methods.

There are several reasons for this qualitative diﬀerence
between 1D and 2D systems. For the case of PEPS ten-
sor networks, which are the main focus of our paper, the
most important reason being the computational cost of
contracting the 2D tensor network. While this cost scales
linearly in the 1D case, it is exponential for 2D and above.
Formally, this is reﬂected in the fact that contracting a
PEPS is #P-hard [12], which is at least NP-hard. To
overcome this exponential hurdle, many approximation
schemes have been devised. For example, in the origi-
nal PEPS paper, the network is contracted column by
column from left to right, by treating the tensors of a
column as matrix product operators (MPO) that act on
a MPS that represents the contracted part of the net-
work. Throughout the contraction, the bond dimension
of the MPS is truncated to some prescribed D(cid:48), which in-
troduces some errors (for details, see Refs. [6, 7]). Other
approximate methods include, for example, the Corner
Transfer Matrix (CTM) [13–15], coarse-graining by ten-
sor Renormalization [16–19], the single layer method [20]
and other variants.

While all of the above methods are physically mo-
tivated, none of them are rigorous. And to some ex-
tent they all produce uncontrolled approximations, even
when dealing with the ground state itself. Moreover,
while their computational cost is now polynomial
in
the bond dimension and the particle number,
it still
scales badly, which limits their practical use to small
systems/resolutions (state of the art now days is around
15 × 15 sites with D = 6 [21]). This has led some re-
searchers to develop the popular simulation framework,
known as the ‘simple update’ method, in which one com-
pletely abandons the contraction of the 2D network dur-

ing the variational procedure [22], essentially approxi-
mating the environment of a local tensor by a product
state. While this allows for much higher bond dimen-
sions and is often successful for translationally invari-
ant systems, it may produce poor results for systems
that approach critically; see, for example, the analysis
in Refs. [21, 23].

In this paper we introduce a new approach for approx-
imating the expectation value of a local observable in
a 2D PEPS tensor-network. Hopefully, it may be ex-
ploited to provide an antidote to some of the problems of
2D tensor-networks methods that were mentioned above.
Our starting point is a simple observation that while the
contraction of a general 2D PEPS is #P-hard, this is
not necessarily the case if the PEPS describes a ground
state of a gapped local Hamiltonian. Indeed, it is known
that such states exhibit strong properties of locality, such
as exponential decay of correlations [24–26] and local re-
versibility [27], and are therefore subject to many con-
straints to which arbitrary PEPS are not.

We identify two novel mechanisms that can be used to
approximate the expectation value by only accessing a lo-
cal patch of the PEPS tensor network around it. Based
on these mechanisms, we introduce two numerical meth-
ods for the approximation of the local expectation value.
In both methods the entire calculation is local, and can
therefore, in principle, be done eﬃciently. Both methods
provide rigorous upper- and lower- bounds on the ex-
pectation value. While we usually cannot give rigorous
bound on the distance between these bounds, we demon-
strate numerically that this distance – and hence the er-
ror in our approximation – can be surprisingly small.

The ﬁrst method, which we call the ‘basic method’, is
expected to give good results in the case of frustration-
free gapped systems. The second one, which we call the
‘commutator gauge optimization’ (CGO) method, works
only for frustrated systems by utilizing the many inter-
constraints that the solutions of these systems have to
satisfy.
It does not rely directly on the existence of a
gap, and may work even when considering patches of
the PEPS that are much smaller than the correlation
length. We numerically demonstrate both methods using
MPS in 1D systems. Regarding the question posed in
the title of this paper, our ﬁndings suggest that when
the PEPS/MPS tensor-network represents a frustrated
ground state, the information about the local expectation
value is largely encoded locally in the neighborhood of the
observable.

The organization of this paper is as follows. In Sec. II
we formally deﬁne the problem we wish to solve and the
assumptions we are using. In Sec. III we introduce the
basic method to solve the problem, and in Sec. IV we
introduce the CGO method. In Sec. V we present the re-
sults of the 1D numerical tests, and in Sec. VI we discuss
the results and oﬀer our conclusions.

are marked by red dots.

II. STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM

Our construction involves PEPS and MPS tensor net-
works. For the exact deﬁnition and review of these tensor
networks (and tensor networks in general), we refer the
reader to Refs. [1, 7].

We are given a local Hamiltonian H = (cid:80)

i hi that is
deﬁned on a system of N × N spins of local dimension d
that sit on a 2D rectangular lattice, which can be either
open or with periodic boundary conditions. The local
terms hi have O(1) bounded norms, and are assumed to
be working on nearest neighbors only. We further as-
sume that H is gapped, with a unique ground state |Ω(cid:105)
that is exactly described by a PEPS with bond dimen-
sion D = O(1). While in practice this is rarely the case,
and D may have to be exponentially large in order for the
PEPS to exactly describe the ground state, it is expected
that a D = O(1) bond dimension should give very good
approximations to a gapped ground state. For the sake
of clarity we will ﬁrst assume that the D = O(1) descrip-
tion is exact; we will return to discuss this assumption in
Sec. IV D.

Given a local observable B that acts on, say, 2 neigh-
boring spins on the lattice, our task is to approximate
(cid:104)B(cid:105) := (cid:104)Ω|B|Ω(cid:105) using only a local patch of the PEPS
around B. Speciﬁcally, the local patch is deﬁned by a
ball L of radius (cid:96) around B. L contains all the sites on
the lattice that can be connected to the support of B
using at most (cid:96) steps on the lattice. We let Lc denote
the complement region of L that contains all the spins
outside of L. An example of the local ball L for (cid:96) = 3 is
given in Fig. 1.

Without loss of generality, we will assume that B is
normalized so that (cid:107)B(cid:107) = 1; all of our results can be
applied to the general case with a simple rescaling.

Consider now the PEPS representation of |Ω(cid:105), and let
α = (α1, α2, . . . , ) be the set of virtual indices that con-
nect the spins in L to those outside of it. As illustrated

described by a PEPS and therefore satisﬁes an area law
(this, in turn, can also be attributed to the existence of
a gap). We begin with the basic method.

III. THE BASIC METHOD

Let PV be the projector into the subspace VL, and de-
ﬁne BL := PV BPV . Then as ρL = PV ρLPV , we get
from the cyclicity of the trace that (cid:104)B(cid:105) = Tr(BρL) =
Tr(BPV ρLPV ) = Tr(PV BPV ρL) = Tr(BLρL). Equiva-
lently, (cid:104)B(cid:105) = (cid:104)Ω|BL|Ω(cid:105). Therefore, if b1 ≤ b2 ≤ . . . ≤ bq
are the eigenvalues of BL in the subspace VL, then
(cid:104)B(cid:105) ∈ [b1, bq]. The basic method is then to simply calcu-
late the largest and the smallest eigenvalues of BL in the
VL subspace and use these as lower- and upper- bounds
to (cid:104)B(cid:105).
Intuitively, when the system is gapped, we expect the
range [b1, bq] to narrow down as (cid:96) → ∞ for the following
reason. Every α = (α1, . . . , αq) can be seen as a speciﬁc
boundary condition for a restricted system on the ball L,
and as the system is gapped, we expect the eﬀect of these
boundary conditions to be negligible. Hence, we expect
(cid:104)Iα|B|Iα(cid:105)/(cid:107)Iα(cid:107)2 → (cid:104)B(cid:105) as (cid:96) → ∞, and similarly for
any linear combination of the |Iα(cid:105) vectors. In particular
this means that the eigenvalues of BL are expected to
converge to (cid:104)B(cid:105). The following lemma shows that this is
indeed the case when the eigenvalues of ρL are not too
small.

Lemma 1 Let λ2
min be the minimal eigenvalue of ρL,
and let b1, . . . , bq be the eigenvalues of BL = PV BPV
in the subspace VL. Then for every β = 1, . . . , q,

|bα − (cid:104)B(cid:105)| ≤ (cid:107)BL(cid:107)

where ξ > 0 is the correlation length of |Ω(cid:105).
Proof: The proof is a simple application of the basic idea
in the Choi-Jamio(cid:32)lkowski
isomorphism, together with
the exponential decay of correlation property of gapped
ground states [24]. Let |b1(cid:105),|b2(cid:105), . . .|bq(cid:105) be the eigen-
vectors of BL in VL that correspond to the eigenvalues
b1, b2, . . . , bq. They constitute an orthonormal basis of
α λα| ˆOα(cid:105) ⊗ | ˆIα(cid:105) be the Schmidt de-
composition of |Ω(cid:105) with respect to L and Lc such that
α| ˆIα(cid:105)(cid:104) ˆIα|. Both {|bβ(cid:105)} and {| ˆIα(cid:105)} are or-
thonormal bases of VL, and therefore they are connected
α Uβα| ˆIα(cid:105). We use
it to deﬁne a set of (un-normalized) states on the spins
of Lc:

In addition, we deﬁne the operator Cβ := |cβ(cid:105)(cid:104)cβ| ⊗ 1L,
where 1L is the identity operator on the spins of L. Us-
ing these deﬁnitions, the following identities are easy to

(α1, α2, . . . , αq) and deﬁnes the outer states {|Oα(cid:105)} and the
inner states {|Iα(cid:105)}, which are described on the right part of
the ﬁgure. The inner vectors {|Iα(cid:105)} and the subspace VL that
they span can be eﬃciently calculated.

α

Above, {|Oα(cid:105)}, {|Iα(cid:105)} are states that are deﬁned by the
PEPS tensor-network outside and inside L respectively.
The sets of vectors {|Oα(cid:105)}, {|Iα(cid:105)} are not necessarily or-
thogonal between themselves, nor are they normalized,
but we assume that both {|Iα(cid:105)} and {|Oα(cid:105)} are linearly
independent among themselves. This is a stronger condi-
tion than the injectivity condition for the PEPS, in which
only {|Iα(cid:105)} have to be linearly independent [28], but as
injectivity, we expect it to hold for generic PEPS. We de-
ﬁne VL := span{|Iα(cid:105)} and let ρL denote the reduced den-
sity matrix of |Ω(cid:105) on L, which lives in the subspace VL.
Note that from our assumptions on {|Iα(cid:105)} and {|Oα(cid:105)}
it follows that VL = ImρL. We let q := dim VL, which
is equal to the size of the range in which the composite
index α = (α1, α2, . . .) runs. Notice that q = DO(|∂L|),
reﬂecting the fact that |Ω(cid:105) satisﬁes an area law.
Clearly, if we knew ρL we could calculate (cid:104)B(cid:105) from
(cid:104)B(cid:105) = (cid:104)Ω|B|Ω(cid:105) = TrL(ρLB). However, directly estimat-
ing ρL involves the contraction of the full network, which
is exactly what we are trying to avoid. Instead, since the
radius (cid:96) is assumed to be small, we can easily calculate
VL := span{|Iα(cid:105)}. Can we estimate (cid:104)B(cid:105) using only VL
and the fact that |Ω(cid:105) is the ground state of H? Formally,
we ask:

Problem 1 Given a local observable B, a ball L of radius
(cid:96) around it, and the corresponding subspace VL, ﬁnd a
range [bmin, bmax], as narrow as possible, such that (cid:104)B(cid:105) ∈
[bmin, bmax].

We oﬀer two methods to tackle this problem. The ﬁrst,
which we call the ‘basic method’, is expected to work
well when the system is gapped, and is suitable mostly
for frustration-free systems. The second, which we call
‘the commutators gauge optimization’ method, is much
more powerful and applies only for frustrated systems.
It relies on the assumption that |Ω(cid:105) with D = O(1) is

Next, by using the exponential decay of correla-
tions [24] and the uniqueness of the ground state, we

deduce that(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:104)Ω|CβB|Ω(cid:105) − (cid:104)Ω|Cβ|Ω(cid:105) · (cid:104)Ω|B|Ω(cid:105)

≤ (cid:107)B(cid:107) · (cid:107)Cβ(cid:107) · e

−(cid:96)/ξ .

Let us analyze the above inequality term by term. First,
by Eq. (6) and the fact that Cβ and B commute,
(cid:104)Ω|CβB|Ω(cid:105) = 1(cid:107)cβ(cid:107)2(cid:104)Ω|CβBCβ|Ω(cid:105). But then by Eq. (4),
this is equal to (cid:104)bβ|B|bβ(cid:105) = (cid:104)bβ|BL|bβ(cid:105) = bβ. A similar
Finally, using Eq. (5) and the fact that (cid:80)
argument shows that (cid:104)Ω|Cβ|Ω(cid:105) = 1. Substituting this
into the LHS of (7), we get |bβ−(cid:104)B(cid:105)| ≤ (cid:107)B(cid:107)·(cid:107)Cβ(cid:107)·e−(cid:96)/ξ.
γ |Uβγ|2 = 1
(since Uβγ are the entries of a unitary matrix), proves
the lemma.

Lemma 1 shows that if the smallest eigenvalue of ρL
is lowerbounded by e−c(cid:96)/ξ for some c < 1, the range
[b1, bq] should converge to the point (cid:104)B(cid:105) exponentially
fast in (cid:96). This is certainly expected in most 1D ground
states that are approximated by an MPS of a constant
bond dimension D. However, it can hardly happen in
2D, where even if the state is approximated by a PEPS
with D = O(1), the dimension of VL grows at least as
DO((cid:96)), and consequently, the smallest eigenvalue of ρL
is expected to fall oﬀ exponentially like D−O((cid:96)). In 3D
things are even worse, since dim VL grows like DO((cid:96)2).

When the underlying Hamiltonian is frustration-free,
VL is a subspace of the groundspace of HL, the part of
H that is supported on the spins of L. In such case, it is
easy to see that if the Hamiltonian satisﬁes the local topo-
logical order (LTQO) property [29] (see also Ref. [30]),
then necessarily |bα − (cid:104)B(cid:105)| decays as a function of (cid:96) (the
rate of the decay depends on the particular deﬁnition of
LTQO). Related to that, Lemma 1 has much in common
with Theorem 11 of Ref. [30], which shows that parent
Hamiltonians of translationally invariant, injective MPS
satisfy LTQO.

We conclude this section by proving a somewhat
stronger result than Lemma 1 that holds for frustration-
free systems:
Lemma 2 When |Ω(cid:105) is the unique ground state of a
frustration-free Hamiltonian with an O(1) spectral gap,
then

BL|Ω(cid:105) = (cid:104)B(cid:105)|Ω(cid:105) + |δ(cid:105) ,

(8)

where (cid:107)|δ(cid:105)(cid:107) ≤ e−O((cid:96)). In other words, |Ω(cid:105) is an approxi-

mate eigenvector of BL.

4

The proof of this lemma is given in the appendix. For-
mally, it is at least as strong as Lemma 1 because it can be
used to derive Lemma 1 when the system is frustration-
free. Indeed, using the notation of the proof of Lemma 1,
the lemma can be proved by multiplying inequality (8)
by Cβ and then by (cid:104)cβ|⊗(cid:104)ββ|. But it also seems stronger
since it tells us something about the eigenvalues of BL
min is much smaller then e−(cid:96)/ξ. To see this,
even when λ2

β

In terms of the eigenbasis of BL and ρL, the above in-
equality can be written as

−O((cid:96)) .

(9)

As {(cid:104)bβ|ρL|bβ(cid:105)} is the probability distribution that cor-
responds to the measurement of BL, we can use Markov
inequality to deduce that if we measure BL on |Ω(cid:105), then
with probability of at least 1 − e−O((cid:96)) we will obtain an
eigenvalue of BL that is e−O((cid:96)) close to (cid:104)B(cid:105). This holds

regardless of the minimal eigenvalue of ρL. Therefore in
cases where the weight of all the eigenvalues of BL in ρL
is of the same order (which can be much much smaller
than e−O((cid:96)) in 3D), then an exponentially large fraction
of them must be exponentially close to (cid:104)B(cid:105). This does
not prove that the range [bmin, bmax] rapidly shrinks, but
it supports the intuition that this should generally be the
case.

We conclude this section noting that for frustrated sys-
tem a similar result to Lemma 2 can be proved using the
same techniques that are used to prove the exponential
decay of correlations in the frustrated case [24]: a combi-
nation of Lieb-Robinson bounds and a suitable ﬁltering
function. In fact, a very similar result was already proven
by Hastings in Ref. [31] for the special case when B is
a local Hamiltonian term. However, instead of pursuing
that direction, we turn to a diﬀerent method, which turns
out to be much more powerful for our problem.

IV. THE COMMUTATOR GAUGE

OPTIMIZATION

In this section we introduce the Commutator Gauge
Optimization method (CGO for short), which is appli-
cable for frustrated systems. As we shall see, it can be
viewed as pair of primal-dual SDP optimization problem.
We start with the formulation of the primal optimization
problems.

A. The primal problem

Our starting point is the main observation of the ba-
sic method, that the expectation value (cid:104)B(cid:105) must be in-
side eigenvalues range [bmin, bmax] of the operator BL =

Then the CGO method can be summarized by the fol-
lowing optimization problem:

Problem 2 (The primal CGO optimization)

Hamiltonian H in the form of a PEPS, and a ball L of
radius (cid:96) around B, calculate

the internal region L0 (light gray, red vertices).

PV BPV . The additional idea is that this must hold for
any other operator K for which (cid:104)K(cid:105) = (cid:104)B(cid:105). Therefore,
if we can ﬁnd an operator K such that (cid:104)B(cid:105) = (cid:104)K(cid:105), then
necessarily (cid:104)B(cid:105) must also be inside the range [kmin, kmax]
of the minimal and maximal eigenvalues of PV KPV . By
optimizing over a subset of such operators, we may sig-
niﬁcantly narrow down the range in which (cid:104)B(cid:105) is found.
We therefore look for operators, Kmin, Kmax on L such
that

(cid:104)Ω|Kmin|Ω(cid:105) = (cid:104)Ω|Kmax|Ω(cid:105) = (cid:104)Ω|B|Ω(cid:105) ,

(10)

but at the time, PLKmaxPL has the smallest possible
maximal eigenvalue, and PLKminPL has the largest pos-
sible minimal eigenvalue.

What is a good way to ﬁnd such Kmin, Kmax? A very
simple yet powerful trick is to look for operators of the
form:

Kmin = B + [H, Amin], Kmax = B + [H, Amax] , (11)

are

where Amin, Amax
anti-Hermitian such that
Kmin, Kmax are Hermitian. For any eigenstate |(cid:105) of
it is easy to verify that
H and for any operator A,
(cid:104)|[H, A]|(cid:105) = 0 and therefore Eq. (10) holds.
In that
sense Kmin and Kmax can be viewed as a diﬀerent
“gauges” of B, which have the same expectation value
with respect to |Ω(cid:105).
By taking the support of Amin, Amax to be small
enough, we can guarantee that [H, Amin] and [H, Amax]
are supported in L. Formally, we partition the spins of L
into two disjoint subsets, L = ∂L∪L0. Here, ∂L contains
the spins in L that are coupled to spins in Lc via one or
more local terms in H, and L0 contains the rest of the
spins in L. An illustration of this decomposition is given
in Fig. 3. Letting HL denote the sum of all the local hi
terms whose support is inside L, we conclude that when
the support of A is inside L0, then [H, A] = [HL, A], and
this commutator is supported inside L.

For a given Hermitian operator O, denote by
eigenvalues.

λmin(O), λmax(O)

Above, the optimization is over all anti-Hermitian oper-
ators A that are supported on L0.

Two notes are in order. First, the presence of PV in the
above equations is crucial, as its the only place where in-
formation about the ground state is entering the problem.
Without it, values from other eigenstates of H might
worsen our estimate. It is therefore clear why some sort
of an area-law is required for CGO to work; if the sup-
port of ρL (i.e., the subspace V ) is the entire available
Hilbert space, then there is nothing in VL that tells us
that we are dealing with the ground state and not, say,
some other eigenstate of H.

Second, when H is frustration free, PV HL = HLPV =
0 and so PV (B + [HL, A])PV = PV BPV for all A; the
CGO method then simply becomes the basic method.

Before discussing how the optimization problem 2 can

be done in practice, let us introduce its dual.

B. The dual problem

To introduce the dual problem, we begin with the con-
straint (cid:104)Ω|[HL, A]|Ω(cid:105) = 0, which holds for every A that
is supported on the spins in L0. Tracing out the spins in
Lc, we get

(14)

Tr(ρL[HL, A]) = 0 ∀A ∈ supp(L0) .

Using the identity Tr(A[B, C]) = Tr(C[A, B]), we arrive
at Tr(A[ρL, HL]) = 0. Writing Tr = TrL0 Tr∂L, the last

equation can be rewritten as TrL0 A(cid:0) Tr∂L[ρL, HL](cid:1) = 0.

But since A is an arbitrary anti-Hermitian operator on
L0, it implies that the expression it multiplies has to
vanish. We therefore reach the following corollary:

Corollary 3 Let ρL be the reduced density matrix of an
eigenstate of H in the region L. Then,

Tr∂L[ρL, HL] = 0 .

(15)

The above identity holds for all eigenstates of H and
for all regions L, regardless of any assumption about a
gap or the existence of a PEPS description. Despite its
simplicity, to best of our knowledge, it has never been
used before. When H is frustration free and ρL is the
reduced density matrix of the ground state, it is satisﬁed

trivially since [ρL, HL] = 0. However, when the system is
frustrated, Eq. (15) provides many non-trivial constraints
as it holds pointwise on the Hilbert space of L0.

Corollary 3 allows us to formulate a dual to the op-
timization problem given in Problem 2. Instead of op-
timizing over anti-Hermitian operators A, we may opti-
mize over ‘legal’ reduced density matrices, which satisfy
Eq. (15). Formally,

Problem 3 (The dual CGO problem) Given a local
observable B, a ground state |Ω(cid:105) of a local Hamiltonian
H in the form of a PEPS, and a ball L of radius (cid:96) around
B, calculate

k(D)
max := max
ρL∈SL

and
k(D)
min := min
ρL∈SL

Tr(ρLB)

Tr(ρLB) .

(16)

(17)

Above, SL is the set of all density matrices ρL in VL (i.e.,
ρL (cid:23) 0, Tr(ρL) = 1) that satisfy Eq. (15).

One can prove directly that k(P )
max and that
k(P )
min ≤ k(D)
min. We omit the proof since it will follow
naturally from viewing these two optimizations as dual
semideﬁnite programs (SDPs), as we shall now do.

max ≥ k(D)

C. The commutator gauge optimization as a SDP

The primal CGO problem and its dual can be cast as
semideﬁnite programs. Let us demonstrate it for the up-
perbound of (cid:104)B(cid:105); the lowerbound follows similarly. To
write (12) as an SDP, note that a number λ is an upper-
bound to all eigenvalues of an operator O iﬀ λ1− O (cid:23) 0,
where (cid:23) 0 stands for non-negative matrix. Then choos-
ing a basis A1, A2, . . . , Am for all the anti-Hermitian ma-
trices in L0, the optimization over (12) can be written
as

minimize:

b

subject to:

b1 −

m(cid:88)

i=1

(18)

ciPV [HL, Ai]PV − PV BPV (cid:23) 0
(19)

Above, the optimization is done over the real numbers
b, c1, c2, . . . , cm. The dual SDP is then

maximize: Tr(ρLPV BPV )
subject to: ρL (cid:23) 0, Tr(ρL1) = 1,

and Tr(ρLPV [HL, Ai]PV ) = 0 ∀i

(20)
(21)

which is identical to the optimization in (16). By the
weak duality of semi-deﬁnite programming, we note that
the value in (20) lowerbounds the one in (18), and that
in many cases they are identical. In the next section, we
present the results of some numerical tests we performed
on 1D systems to check the performance of such SDPs.

D. Working with constant bond dimensions

Up to now we have assumed that the ground state |Ω(cid:105)
is given exactly as a PEPS with constant bond dimension
D. However, in virtually all frustrated systems, a con-
stant D can only give an approximation to the ground
state. To distinguish the actual PEPS approximation
from the exact ground state, we will denote it by |Ωp(cid:105).
Given that |Ωp(cid:105) is only an approximation to the ground
state |Ω(cid:105), we can only expect (cid:104)Ωp|[H, A]|Ωp(cid:105) to be close
to zero, but not completely vanish. Similarly, Eq. (15) is
expected to be only approximately satisﬁed. While this
may look merely as an aesthetic defect, it raises a con-
ceptual problem:
if D is constant, the dimension of VL
increases like DO((cid:96)), while the number of constraints in
Eq. (15) goes like dO((cid:96)2). For large enough, yet constant
(cid:96), it is expected that Eq. (15) is over-determined, or sim-
ply unsatisﬁable. From an SDP point of view, we expect
the constraints in the primal and the dual problems to
become linearly dependent, causing the dual problem not
to have any feasible solution and the primal problem to
yield inﬁnities.

A practical (though probably not optimal) solution to
this is to use only a subset of all possible Ai in the SDP
procedure. Note that this only relaxes the program in
Eq. (20) (and corresponding program for minimum eigen-
value) and hence increases the range [k(D)
min]. One
way to do it is to create an increasing list of random Ai
matrices and feed it to the SDP until they become lin-
early dependent. As long as the matrices are not linearly
dependent and are of a comparable norm, we expect the
solution of SDPs (18, 20) with PV taken from |Ωp(cid:105) to
produce results that are close to the exact case. The 1D
numerical tests that we present in the following section
support this conjecture.

V. NUMERICAL TESTS

Due to the reduced computational cost, we performed
all of our tests on 1D systems whose ground states are
described by MPS. Nevertheless, we strongly believe that
our conclusions hold also for 2D systems, which we leave
for future research. The main purpose of these tests is
not to suggest a practical numerical method for estimat-
ing (cid:104)B(cid:105) (this would be silly in 1D), but to demonstrate
that a surprisingly large amount of information is found
locally in a tensor network that represents a ground state,
in particular if the system is frustrated. Hopefully, some
of these ideas could be later used to construct a practi-
cal numerical way to approximate the local expectation
values. Moreover, we performed these tests using very
natural and simple heuristics to apply the SDP optimiza-
tions, without any attempt to ﬁne tune or optimize our
method. We therefore suspect that much of our results
can be signiﬁcantly improved by using better numerical
methods.

We analyzed four well-known systems, which we label
System-A, System-B, System-C, and System-D. All sys-
tems are deﬁned over N = 100 spins with open boundary
conditions. The underlying Hamiltonians are nearest-
neighbors with unique ground states and an O(1) spec-
tral gap and correlation lengths which were calculated
numerically. The full details are as follows:

System-A - 1D AKLT. This is a frustration-free sys-

The ground state is known analytically, and is described
by the AKLT valance bond state, which can be written
as a MPS with bond dimension D = 2. The spectral
gap in the thermodynamic limit is ∆A (cid:39) 0.35 [34]. The
correlation length is ξA (cid:39) 0.9.
System-B - Transverse Ising model. This is the clas-
sical Ising model equipped with a transverse magnetic
ﬁeld in the ˆz direction:

System-D - XY model with random ﬁeld. Just like
System-C, only that here the transverse ﬁeld at spin i
is given by hi, which is a uniformly distributed random
number in the range [1.05, 1.15].

For h = 1.1, α = 0.5 and hi ∼ [1.05, 1.15], the gap was
evaluated numerically to be ∆D (cid:39) 0.06. The average
correlation length was just like as in System-C.

While system A is frustration-free, systems B,C,D are
frustrated with substantially smaller spectral gaps and
larger correlation lengths. Their ground states were
found using a standard DMRG program with a constant
bond dimension D. We ﬁrst veriﬁed that the local ex-
pectation values do not change by more than 10−5 when
passing from D = 6 to D = 20. This indicated that
D = 6 is a good enough bond dimension for our sys-
tems. However, in order to suppress as much as possible
the ﬁnite truncation errors, we ﬁrst computed the ground
state as an MPS with D = 20 and then deﬁned the sub-
space VL by truncating the bonds at the two cuts from
index value 7 onward. All together, this deﬁned a sub-
space VL of dimension q = 6 × 6 = 36. The essential
diﬀerence between this procedure and directly using the
D = 6 MPS is that now the 36 vectors {|Iα(cid:105)} that span
VL are resolved inside the ball L using D = 20 instead
of D = 6.

In all systems we used 2-spin observables that acted
on spin numbers 50,51 in the middle of the chain. For

system-A we used three random projectors. Each pro-
jector was chosen by randomly picking a 2-dimensional
subspace out of the 9-dimensional subspace of two spin-1
particles. In the B,C,D systems we used the three projec-
tors: (i) PxPx projects to the product state of two spin
up in the ˆx direction, i.e., PxPx = |+(cid:105)(cid:104)+| ⊗ |+(cid:105)(cid:104)+|, (ii)
PzPz = |0(cid:105)(cid:104)0| ⊗ |0(cid:105)(cid:104)0| is identical to PxPx but in the ˆz
direction, and (iii) a projector to a random (pure) state
in the 4-dimensional space of the two spin 1/2 particles.
For each system and each observable we applied the
basic and CGO methods with (cid:96) = 3, that corresponds
to a ball L of 8 spins, and (cid:96) = 4, with 10 spins. Since
System-A is frustration-free we only applied the basic
method to it.

In the frustrated systems our SDP calculations were
performed using the open-source package SDPA [35, 36].
As noted in Sec. IV D, when working with constant D,
Eq. (15) is usually over-determined, and therefore one
should not use a complete spanning basis of Ai matrices.
Following the idea from that section, we used a set of

0.20.21250.225400500600700No.ofAihBi=0.199990.20.200630.201250.20188600650700No.ofAiℓ=3alg.stopsrandom anti-Hermitian matrices Ai which were created
as random MPO of bond dimension D = 20. Then we
ran the SDP for the lower and upper bounds on (cid:104)B(cid:105),
gradually increasing the number of Ai.
We used the following heuristics to decide when to stop
adding more Ai’s and read the ﬁnal result. First, at ev-
ery step, we calculated the diﬀerence between the up-
perbound and the lowerbound to (cid:104)B(cid:105), and this served
as a natural error scale. If the diﬀerence became nega-
tive (i.e., lowerbound was greater than the upperbound),
we took the results of the previous step. Additionally,
we stopped if the graph started to “wiggle”:
if at one
step the upperbound or lowerbound were worsened with
respect to the previous step by more than 1% of the er-
ror length scale, we stopped and used the result of the
previous step. In all runs (in systems B,C,D) this proce-
dure resulted in an SDP estimate that is based on about
520-710 Ai matrices.

A typical evolution of the upper/lower bounds for (cid:96) =
3, 4 as the number of Ai increases is presented in Fig. 4.
The graph shows the evolution of the bounds in the case
of system D (the XY model with random transverse ﬁeld)
with the random projector.

2 (kmax − kmin).

The full numerical results for the four systems are sum-
marized in Tables I,II,III,IV. Table I presents the (cid:96) = 3, 4
basic method results for system A, the frustration-free
AKLT model. The other three tables are for the frus-
trated models B,C,D, and they also include the CGO
results. For each test we present the lowerbound and the
upperbound in the form of a [kmin, kmax] range, as well
as the estimated error ∆ := 1

In the frustrated case, the (cid:96) = 3, 4 radii of the lo-
cal environment are well below the range where decay
of correlation should be felt.
It is not surprising then
that the basic method in these cases performs very badly,
and is unable to give a single meaningful digit in the ap-
proximation of (cid:104)B(cid:105). At the same time, quite remark-
ably, the CGO method manages to recover 3–4 digits
(and often 4–5 digits) from (cid:104)B(cid:105). Moreover, these results
are always better than their equivalent basic results for
the frustration-free AKLT model, despite having a much
larger correlation length (ξ = 8.8 and ξ = 4.3 vs. ξ = 0.9
for the AKLT) and a much larger VL subspace (q = 36
vs. q = 4 for the AKLT).

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We have presented a new approach to approximate
the expectation value of a local operator given a PEPS
tensor-network. Our initial observation is that while this
is generally a computationally hard task (#P-hard), it is
not necessarily the case for PEPS that represent gapped
ground states, since these states have much more struc-
ture. Our approach circumvents the exponentially ex-
pensive contraction of the environment by estimating the
local expectation value using only a local patch of the
PEPS tensor-network around it. We have presented two

9

methods to accomplish that. The basic method simply
diagonalizes the observable in the subspace VL and uses
its extreme eigenvalues as upper/lower bounds for the
expectation value. We have argued that this range is
expected to converge as the radius of the local patch in-
creases; it should in particular be useful for frustration-
free systems. The second method, CGO, builds upon the
basic method, but uses optimization over commutators
to narrow down the eigenvalue range signiﬁcantly. For it
to work, the system has to be frustrated.

In a hindsight this is reasonable:

As demonstrated by our numerical tests, both methods
allow one to extract a signiﬁcant amount of information
about the local expectation value using only a local patch
of the surrounding tensor network. Contrary to what one
might have expected, it seems that in frustrated systems
much more information can be extracted from a local
patch.
in frustrated
systems the ground state is not a common eigenstate of
all local terms [37]; only once we consider all local terms,
we satisfy the eigenstate equation. This implies that the
action of one local term must somehow cancel the action
of other local terms, and this inter-dependence leads to
many non-trivial constraints that can be exploited to re-
cover ρL from its underlying subspace (see Corollary 3).
Our work leaves many open questions for future re-
search. From a numerical point of view, the most imme-
diate question we would like to answer is how eﬀective
the CGO method is in 2D. As it stands now, repeating
the same procedure that we have used in the 1D case is
impractical. Tentatively, for the CGO method to work,
one needs a high enough D that would yield good ap-
proximation to the groundstate of a frustrated system,
and in addition the dimension of the VL subspace should
be smaller than the physical dimension of the spins inside
L – i.e., the area law should be non-trivially felt. Con-
sider, for example, the rectangular grid in Fig. 1. There,
we have dim VL = D2(4(cid:96)+3) while the physical dimension
goes like d2((cid:96)+1)2
. So if we consider a D = 4 PEPS over
d = 2 spins, the physical dimension wins over dim VL at
(cid:96) = 7, and reasonable results are expected at (cid:96) = 8 or
beyond. This would mean one has to work with matri-
ces of size 2162 × 2162 – an impossible task. It is there-
fore clear that the CGO method cannot be used as it is
in 2D. Nevertheless, it might still be possible to apply
it in approximate manner. For example, by projecting
the system to a random subspace and using concentra-
tion results like the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma [38],
or perhaps, by exploiting the symmetries in the problem
(like translation invariance) in a clever way.

It would be also interesting to see if some aspects of
CGO can be used in existing PEPS algorithms. The
constraints of Corollary 3 may be useful in improving
the simple-update method; even if we deal with small re-
gions L that do not provide a unique answer for ρL, sat-
isfying the constraints in Corollary 3 may improve upon
the simple product-state approximation of the environ-
ment. In addition, they might be useful for increasing the
numerical stability of current algorithms. Finally, from

a numerical point of view it would be interesting to see
if Corollary 3 could be used to verify that we have an
eigenstate at our hands. This might be useful, for ex-
ample, for settling the nature of the groundstate of the
antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the kagome lat-
tice [39–43].

From a more theoretical point of view, it would be
interesting to gain better understanding of the CGO
method, and in particular the implications of the con-
straints in Corollary 3. For example, can we ﬁnd suﬃ-
cient conditions to when the method gives good approx-
imations (i.e., narrow [kmin, kmax] range)? From a com-
putational complexity point of view, this might be a step
in showing that PEPS of ground states can serve as an
NP witness. A much more ambitious goal in that direc-
tion would be to show that the complexity of the local
Hamiltonian problem for gapped Hamiltonians on a reg-
ular lattice with a unique ground state is inside NP.

Appendix A: Proof of Lemma 2

The proof of Lemma 2 utilizes the detectability-
lemma [44] (see also Ref. [45]), and to a large extent
already appeared in Ref. [44]. We give the full proof here
for sake of completeness.

Given a local Hamiltonian H =(cid:80)

We start by introducing the detectability lemma.
i hi, we deﬁne for ev-
ery hi a projector Pi that projects onto its local ground
space. Next we partition the Pi terms into g ‘layers’,
such that each layer is a collection of projectors with
disjoint support. For example, a 1D chain can be par-
titioned into two layers – one for projectors on (i, i + 1)
with even i’s, and the second for odd i’s. Then for every
layer (cid:96), we deﬁne the projector Π(cid:96), which is the product
of all the Pi projectors in that layer; it is the projec-

10

tor onto the common ground space of all local terms in
that layer. The detectability lemma operator, DL(H) is
then deﬁned to be the product of the layer projectors:
DL(H) := Π1 ··· Πg. Because the system is frustration
free, it follows that DL(H)|Ω(cid:105) = |Ω(cid:105). The detectability
lemma states that if both the number of layers and the
spectral gap of H are of O(1), then for every state |ψ(cid:105)
orthogonal to the ground space, (cid:107) DL(H)|Ω⊥
(cid:105)(cid:107)2 ≤ c < 1
for some constant c. Therefore, taking (cid:96) powers of the
detectability lemma operator, we get an exponentially

organized in layers. The dark gray ovals are projectors that
can be ‘pulled’ out from the PV operator (here, on the bot-
tom). They form a sort of casual ‘light-cone’ deﬁned by the
local operator B. The rest of the projectors (represented by
light-gray ovals) can be pulled out of the ground state |Ω(cid:105)
(here, at the top).

good approximation to the ground space projector:

(cid:107) DL(cid:96)(H) − |Ω(cid:105)(cid:104)Ω|(cid:107) ≤ e

−O((cid:96)) .

(A1)

Let us now return to the proof of the lemma. It consists

of two steps. The ﬁrst step is to notice that

(cid:48)

BL|Ω(cid:105) = PV B|Ω(cid:105) = PV DL(cid:96)

(H)B|Ω(cid:105) ,

(A2)

where (cid:96)(cid:48) = O((cid:96)). The ﬁrst equality follows from deﬁni-

tion. The second equality follows from writing DL(H)(cid:96)
in terms of the local Pi projectors, and noticing that each
such Pi projector can be either ‘pulled’ from the PV pro-
jector or from the ground state |Ω(cid:105). This is illustrated in
Fig. 5 for the 1D case, see Ref. [44] for more details.

(cid:48)

The second step uses (A1) to replace DL(cid:96)
|Ω(cid:105)(cid:104)Ω| + e−O((cid:96)

(cid:48)) = |Ω(cid:105)(cid:104)Ω| + e−O((cid:96)), giving us
−O((cid:96))

BL|Ω(cid:105) = PV · |Ω(cid:105)(cid:104)Ω| · B|Ω(cid:105) + e

= (cid:104)B(cid:105)|Ω(cid:105) + e

−O((cid:96)) .

This proves the lemma.

[37] Strictly speaking, one can have a frustrated system in
which the groundstate is a common eigenstate – for ex-
ample, a frustrated classical system. However, in some
sense these are ‘genuine’ frustrated systems, since they
can be trivially transformed into a frustration-free sys-
tem by by locally subtracting an identity term from ev-
ery local term in the Hamiltonian. This would make the
system frustration-free and only shift its spectrum by a
constant.
