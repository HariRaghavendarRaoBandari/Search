Abstract. Let A be a ﬁnite dimensional G-graded algebra with G a ﬁnite
group, and A#k[G]∗ be the smash product of A with the group G. Our re-
sults can be stated as follows: (1) If A is a self-injective algebra and separably
graded, then the dimensions of triangulated categories modA and modA#k[G]∗
are equal.
In particular, we obtain that the representation dimension of
A#k[G]∗ is at least the dimension of triangulated category modA plus 2;
(2) Generally, if A is a k-algebra and separably graded, then the Oppermann
dimensions of A and A#k[G]∗ are equal.
In particular, we obtain that the
representation dimension of A#k[G]∗ is at least the Oppermann dimension of
A plus 2. In the end, we give two examples to illustrate our results.

1. Introduction

1.1. Background. The representation dimension of a ﬁnite dimensional algebra
was introduced by Auslander [1]. Auslander has shown that an algebra is represen-
tation ﬁnite if and only if its representation dimension is at most two. He expected
that the representation dimension should measure how far an algebra is far from
being of representation ﬁnite algebras. For more than three decades, it was unclear
whether Auslander’s philosophy works.

In 2006, Rouquier showed that the representation dimension of the exterior alge-
bra of an n-dimensional vector space is n + 1, in which the notion of the dimension
of a triangulated category played a very important role (cf.
In [5], Erd-
mann etc.
introduced ﬁnite generation assumption (Fg). Bergh showed that if a
non-semisimple self-injective algebra satisﬁes Fg, then the dimension of its stable
module category as a triangulated category is at least its complexity minus one [2].
In 2009, Oppermann gave a lattice criterion of computing the lower bound of the
representation dimesion of a ﬁnite dimensional algebra and in this way one obtained
a large class of algebras with large representation dimensions [9]. For a ﬁnite
dimensional algebra A, the key tool he invented for computing the representation
dimension is nowadays called Oppermann dimension (see the deﬁnition in Section
2), denoted it by OdimA. And he obtained that rep.dimA ≥ OdimA+2 [9].

[13]).

On the other hand, representations and homological properties of smash product
algebras (see the deﬁnition in Section 3) have been widely studied, see [8, 14]. It
has been shown that A#k[G]∗ and A share many common properties. For example,
A#k[G]∗ is a self-injective algebra if and only if so is A [8]. It is natural to compare
the dimensions of the stable module categories of A#k[G]∗ and A as triangulated
categories. Concerning the representation dimension of a ﬁnite dimensional algebra,
it is reasonable to compare the Oppermann dimensions of A#k[G]∗ and A. Then
it is possible to obtain a new class of algebras whose representation dimensions are
arbitrarily large.

Our main results in this paper are the following two theorems.

Theorem 1.1. Let A = ⊕g∈GAg be a ﬁnite dimensional G-graded self-injective
k-algebra with G a ﬁnite group. Then

dim(modA#k[G]∗) ≤ dim(modA).

Furthermore, if A is separably graded, then

dim(modA#k[G]∗) = dim(modA).

In this case, we obtain that rep.dim(A#k[G]∗) ≥ dim(modA) + 2.

Theorem 1.2. Let A = ⊕g∈GAg be a G-graded k-algebra with G a ﬁnite group .
Denote by B = A#k[G]∗. Then

OdimB ≤ OdimA.

Furthermore, if A is separably graded, then

In this case, we obtain that rep.dimB ≥ OdimA + 2.

OdimB = OdimA.

1.2. Organization. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we shall recall
some basic deﬁnitions and facts needed in our proofs. Theorem 1.1 and 1.2 will
be proved in Section 3. In Section 4, we shall give two examples to illustrate our
results.

2. Preliminaries

Throughout this paper, k is an algebraically closed ﬁeld, A is a ﬁnite dimen-
sional k-algebra. Denote by modA the category of ﬁnitely generated left A-modules,
P(modA) the full subcategory of modA consisting of all projective objects in modA,
gl.dimA the global dimension of A. D := Homk(−, k) denotes the standard duality

functor between modA and modAop. Given a left A-module M , addM denotes the
full subcategory of modA consisting of all direct summands of ﬁnite direct sums of
copies of M .

Dimension of a triangulated category. Let T be a triangulated category, and
I, J be subcategories of T . Denote by hIi the smallest full subcategory of T
containing I and closed under ﬁnite direct sums, direct summands and shifts.

Denote by I ∗ J the full subcategory of T consisting of objects N such that there
exists a distinguished triangle I → N → J → I[1] in T , with I ∈ I, J ∈ J . Now
let hIi0 = 0, hIi1 = hIi, and inductively hIin+1 = hhIin ∗ hIii.

Deﬁnition 2.1. [13] Let T be a triangulated category. The dimension of T is
deﬁned as

dimT := min{n ∈ N | ∃M ∈ obT such that T = hM in+1}.

Denote by modA the stable module category of A.

It is deﬁned as follows:
the objects of modA are the ﬁnitely generated A-modules, which we will de-
note by M and the homomorphisms in modA are given by HommodA(X, Y ) =
HomA(X, Y )/I(X, Y ), where I(X, Y ) is the subgroup of HomA(X, Y ) consisting
of the A-homomorphisms from X to Y which factor through an injective A-module.
Denote by π : modA → modA the canonical functor, and π(X) = X, π(g) = g,
where X is an object in modA, and g ∈ HomA(X, Y ). The objects X, Y in modA
are called projectively equivalent (resp., injectively equivalent) if there exist pro-
jective (resp., injective) objects P, Q in modA such that X ⊕P ∼= Y ⊕Q, and denote
it by X P∼ Y (resp., X I∼ Y ).

Proposition 2.2. [3, Proposition 1.2.4] Let X, Y be two objects in modA, then
π(X) ∼= π(Y ) if and only if X I∼ Y .

Let A be a ﬁnite dimensional self-injective algebra. The cosyzygy functor Ω−1 :
modA → modA is an equivalence of categories, and a triangulation of modA is
given by using this functor as a shift and by letting short exact sequences in modA
correspond to triangles, and hence modA is a triangulated category [7]. Let X be
in modA, and I(X) the injective hull of X. We need the following Lemma.

Lemma 2.3. Let A be a ﬁnite dimensional self-injective algebra and X, M two
objects in modA, d a nonnegative integer, then X ∈ hM id+1 if and only if there
exist r ∈ N+, ni ∈ Z, an injective A-module I ′, and exact sequences in modA : 0 →
X i
1 ∈ hM i such that
X is a direct summand of ⊕iΩ−ni (X i) ⊕ I ′

2 → 0, i = 1, · · · , r, where X i

1 → X i ⊕ I(X i

1 ∈ hM id, X i

1) → X i

Proof. ‘Necessity’. Since X ∈ hM id+1 = hhM id ∗ hM ii, there exist r ∈ N+, ni ∈ Z,
and distinguished triangles X i
1[1], such that X is a direct
summand of ⊕iΩ−ni (X i), where X i
2 ∈ hM i for i = 1, · · · , r. Then
there exist an injective object I ′ in modA such that X is a direct summand of
⊕iΩ−ni(X i) ⊕ I ′. Now the assertion follows from [10, p.65-66] that 0 → X i
1 →
X i ⊕ I(X i

2 → 0 is an exact sequence in modA, i = 1, · · · , r.

1 → X i → X i

1 ∈ hM id, X i

2 → X i

1) → X i

‘Suﬃciency’. Since 0 → X i

2 → 0 is exact in modA,
i = 1, · · · , r. We have distinguished triangles X i
1), i =
1, · · · , r. Then we have X i ∈ hM id ∗ hM i ⊆ hM id+1 by the assumption that

1 → X i ⊕ I(X i

2 → Ω−1(X i

1) → X i

Representation dimension. Let A be a ﬁnite dimensional k-algebra, a left A-
module M is a generator (resp., a cogenerator) in modA if A ∈ addM (resp.,DA ∈
addM ). For A, the representation dimension rep.dimA[1] is deﬁned to be

rep.dimA := inf{gl.dimEndA(M ) | M is a generator-cogenerator in modA}.

Proposition 2.4. [12, Proposition 3.9] Let A be a non-semisimple self-injective
algebra. Then,

dim(modA) + 2 ≤ rep.dimA ≤ ll(A),

where ll(A) denotes the Loewy length of A.

Smash products. Assume that in this article A = ⊕g∈GAg is a G-graded algebra
for a ﬁnite group G with the identity e. For a ∈ A and g ∈ G, we write ag for the
degree-g component of a, and pg for the function G → k that sends h to δh,g.

Deﬁnition 2.5. The smash product of A with G is the k-algebra A#k[G]∗ =
⊕g∈GApg with multiplication given by apg · bph = abgh−1ph, ∀a, b ∈ A.

Oppermann dimension. Let R = k[x1, . . . , xd] be the polynomial ring in d
variables with coeﬃcients in k and MaxR its maximal spectrum, which is the set
of maximal ideals of R equipped with the Zariski topology. Denote an element of
MaxR by α, and denote by Rα the corresponding localization of R, and Sα the
corresponding simple R-module. Denote by ﬁnR be the category of ﬁnite length
R-modules.

A ﬁnitely generated A ⊗k R-module L is called a d-dimensional lattice if L is
projective as an R-module. Then there is an exact functor for the A ⊗k R-lattice
L,

L ⊗R − : ﬁnR −→ modA.

It induces the following function, also denoted by L ⊗R − :
L ⊗R − : Extd

R(M, N ) −→ Extd

A(L ⊗R M, L ⊗R N ), with (L ⊗R −)[ǫ] = [L ⊗R ǫ].

One knows that Extd

R(Sα, Sα) is generated as a k-module by the equivalence

class of a long exact sequence of the form

ǫα :

0 → Sα → M1 → · · · → Md → Sα → 0

with Rα-modules Mi (1 ≤ i ≤ d) which are indecomposable and of length 2 (see
the argument in [11, Section 6]).

Deﬁnition 2.6. The d-dimensional lattice L is called a d-dimensional Oppermann
lattice for A if Od
A(L⊗R
Sα, L ⊗R Sα)} is dense in MaxR. The Oppermann dimension OdimA of A is the
supremum of d such that there exists a d-dimensional Oppermann lattice L for A.

A(L) := {α ∈ MaxR | [L⊗Rǫα] is a non-zero element of Extd

The following result is due to Oppermann, and it shows that OdimA is always
ﬁnite and that one obtains in this way an interesting lower bound for the represen-
tation dimension:

Theorem 2.7. [9] Let A be a ﬁnite dimensional k-algebra which is not semisimple.
Then

OdimA + 2 ≤ rep.dimA.

REPRESENTATION DIMENSION OF SMASH PRODUCTS

Proposition 2.8. Let A be a ﬁnite dimensional k-algebra. Then OdimA = 0 if
and only if A is of ﬁnite representation type.

Proof. ‘Necessity’ Noting that k is an algebraically closed ﬁeld, by [11, Example
6.2(b)], we have OdimA ≥ 1, if A is a representation inﬁnite algebra .
‘Suﬃciency’ If A is semisimple, then OdimA=0 by the fact that Ext1

A(M, N ) = 0,
for any M , N in modA. Assume that A is a representation-ﬁnite non-semisimple
algebra, then by Auslander’s Theorem rep.dimA = 2, and hence OdimA = 0 by
Theorem 2.7.

3. Representation dimension

Functors of smash products. Let A be a G-graded k-algebra for some ﬁnite
group G with identity e. Then there exists a natural embedding of algebras i : A ֒→
A#k[G]∗, sending a to a · 1 = Ph∈G aph ∈ A#k[G]∗. Denote by B = A#k[G]∗,
there is a pull-up functor F = B ⊗A − : modA → modB, which is exact since B
is free as a right A-module and a push-down functor i∗ : modB → modA which is
induced by the homomorphism i : A ֒→ A#k[G]∗

Deﬁnition 3.1. Let A = ⊕g∈GAg be a G-graded k-algebra for some ﬁnite group
G with identity e. A is called separably graded if there is a family of elements
{xg | g ∈ G} in the center Ae such that

(1) Σgxg = 1,
(2) rxg = xhgr for all r ∈ Ah and all g ∈ G.

Recall the deﬁnition of twisted bimodule. If σ ∈ Aut(A) is a k-algebra automor-
phism, and AMA is an (A, A)-bimodule, we write 1Mσ for the twisted bimodule,
where the left action of A is the same as on M , and the right action of A is deﬁned
by ma = mσ(a), m ∈ M, a ∈ A.

Let B = A#k[G]∗. One knows that {pg | g ∈ G} is a set of pairwise orthogonal
idempotents in B that sum to 1. There is a free right G-action on {pg | g ∈ G},
given by pg · h = pgh, and this induces a right action of G on B.

Lemma 3.2. Let A = ⊕g∈GAg be a G-graded k-algebra for some ﬁnite group G.
Denote by B = A#k[G]∗, then the following assertions hold.

(1) If M is a projective (resp., injective) A-module, then so is B ⊗A M .
(2) For an object M in modA, we have B ⊗A Ω−1M ∼= Ω−1(B ⊗A M ) ⊕ I for

an injective B-module I.

(3) Let Y be in modB, then Y is a direct summand of B ⊗A Y as B-modules.
(4) If A is separably graded, then for any Y ∈ modA , it is a direct summand

of B ⊗A Y as A-modules.

Proof. (1) See [8, Section 2, Corollary 1].

(2) It can be seen from (1).
(3) By [4, Lemma 2.2], B ⊗A B ∼= ⊕x∈G(1Bx), hence B ⊗A Y ∼= B ⊗A (B ⊗B Y ) ∼=

(BB ⊗A B) ⊗B Y ∼= ⊕x∈G(1Bx) ⊗B Y ∼= Y L ⊕x6=e(1Bx ⊗B Y )

(4) See [8, Theorem 3.1].

(cid:3)

Proof of Theorem 1.1. Claim 1. Let AM be an object in modA such that modA =
hM in+1, then modB = hB ⊗A M in+1. We proceed by induction on n.

(i) n = 0. Then modA = hM i1 = hM i, and for each K ∈ modB, we have
AK ∈ hM i. There exists r ∈ N+, ni ∈ Z, i = 1, · · · , r, and K ′ ∈ modA, such that

6

ZHENG ET AL.

K ⊕ K ′ = ⊕iΩni (M ). By Proposition 2.2, we have K ⊕ K ′ I∼ ⊕iΩ−ni (M ). By
Lemma 3.2, B ⊗A (K ⊕ K ′) I∼ B ⊗A (⊕iΩ−ni (M )) since B ⊗A − is an exact functor
and preserves projectivity and injectivity and B ⊗A (⊕iΩ−ni(M )) ∼= ⊕iΩ−ni(B ⊗A
M )⊕I, where I is an injective B-module. This implies B⊗(K⊕K ′) I∼ ⊕iΩ−ni(B⊗A
M ) and then B ⊗A K ∈ hB ⊗A M i, and K ∈ hB ⊗A M i because K is a direct
summand of B ⊗A M by Lemma 3.2.

(ii) Assume the assertion holds for n = k. Let n = k + 1, and K be in modB
such that AK ∈ hM ik+1+1. Then there exist r ∈ N+, ni ∈ Z, i = 1, · · · , r, and an
injective A-mod I ′, and exact sequences in modA as follows.

where K i

see that

B ⊗A K i

hB ⊗A M i, B ⊗A K i
hB ⊗A M ik+2, and hence K ∈ hB ⊗A M ik+2.

1 ∈ hB ⊗A M ik+1. It implies B ⊗A K i ∈ hB ⊗A M ik+2, B ⊗A K ∈

2 ∈

Furthermore, let A be separably graded, we shall show the following claim. It’ll

imply that dim(modA#k[G]∗) = dim(modA).

Claim 2. Let BX be in modB such that modB = hXin+1, we’ll show that
modA = hXin+1. Let K be in modA, B ⊗A K is then in modB, and hence
B ⊗A K ∈ modB = hXin+1. Then by Lemma 2.3, there exist r ∈ N+, ni ∈ Z, i =
1, · · · , r, and exact sequences in modB:

1 ∈ hXin,K i

1 −→ K i ⊕ I(K i

0 −→ K i
2 ∈ hXi, such that B⊗AK is a direct summand of ⊕iΩ−ni(K i)⊕
where K i
I ′ as B-modules. Since A is a subalgebra of B, the sequences above are also exact
in modA, and B ⊗A K is also a direct summand of ⊕iΩ−ni(Y i) ⊕ I ′ as A-modules.
Therefore we have distinguished triangles in modA as follows

and K i ∈ hXin+1 because K i

of ⊕iΩ−1(K i), and then B ⊗A K is a direct summand of ⊕iΩ−1(K i). Since A is
separably graded, K is a direct summand of B ⊗A K as A-modules by Lemma 3.2,
we see K ∈ hXin+1.

Oppermann dimension. Let R be the polynomial ring in d variables with coeﬃ-
cients in k and L a d-dimensional lattice. Recall the notation Od
A(L), that is the set
of α ∈ MaxR such that [L ⊗R ǫα] is a non-zero element of Extd
A(L ⊗R Sα, L ⊗R Sα).
Let L be a d-dimensional lattice for A. Then B ⊗A L is a ﬁnitely generated
B ⊗k R-module, and it is a projective R-module since B is a ﬁnitely generated free
A-module. Hence B ⊗A L is a d-dimensional lattice for B. Conversely, let L be a
d-dimensional lattice for B. It is clear i∗(L) is a ﬁnitely generated A ⊗k R-module,
and projective as an R-module. That is i∗(L) is a d-dimensional lattice for A.

Lemma 3.3. Let Let A = ⊕g∈GAg be a G-graded k-algebra for some ﬁnite group
G. Denote by B = A#k[G]∗. Then the following assertions hold.

(1) Let L be a d-dimensional lattice for B. Then Od

Proof. (1) Let α ∈ Od
Sα, L ⊗R Sα). Then [i∗(L) ⊗R ǫα] is also a non-zero element in Extd
Sα, i∗(L) ⊗R Sα) by [8, Theorem 2.2]. Indeed, let

fd−1→ · · · → P0 → L ⊗R Sα → 0

be a projective resolution of L⊗R Sα. Denote by Kd = kerfd−1, and l : Kd ֒→ Pd−1.
Then the sequence above induces a projective resolution of i∗(L) ⊗R Sα :

→ i∗(Pd) → i∗(Pd−1) → · · · → i∗(P0) → i∗(L) ⊗R Sα → 0,

by the fact that B is a ﬁnitely generated free A-module and i∗(LR ⊗Sα) = i∗(L)⊗R
Sα. One knows that [L ⊗R ǫα] can be presented by a B-homomorphism β : Kd →
L⊗RSα, and in this case [i∗(L)⊗R ǫα] can be presented by i∗(β) : i∗(Kd) → i∗(L⊗R
Sα). If [i∗(L) ⊗R ǫα] = 0, then there exists a A-homomorphism e : i∗(Pd−1) →
i∗(L ⊗R Sα) such that i∗(β) = ei∗(l). By [8, Theorem 2.2], e can be lifted to a B-
homomorphism ˜e : Pd−1 → L ⊗R Sα with ˜e(v) = Σg∈Gpge(pgv) for each v ∈ Pd−1.
We shall show β = ˜el in the following, and hence [L ⊗R ǫα] = 0, contradiction!

Indeed, let m ∈ Kd, then ˜el(m) = ˜e(m) = Σg∈Gpge(pgm)

= Σg∈Gpgei∗(l)(pgm)
= Σg∈Gpgi∗(β)(pgm)

Proof of Theorem 1.2. Let L be a d-dimensional Oppermann lattice for B. Then
i∗(L) is a d-dimensional Oppermann lattice for A by Lemma 3.3 (1). Then OdimB ≤
OdimA.

Let A be a separably graded k-algebra, and L a d-dimensional Oppermann lattice
for A. Then B ⊗A L is a d-dimensional Oppermann lattice for B by Lemma 3.3 (2).
Hence OdimA ≤ OdimB, and hence OdimA = OdimB.

4.1. Exterior algebras. Let ∧V be the exterior algebra of an n-dimensional vec-
tor space V over a ﬁeld k. Then ∧V is a graded self-injective algebra of Loewy
length n + 1 and then it has a natural Zn+1-grading. By the similar argument
as [6, Theorem 4.2], we have ∧V #k[Zn+1]∗ is a graded self-injective algebra of
Loewy length n + 1. It’s not hard to see that if n + 1 is invertible in the ﬁeld k,
then ∧V is separably graded. By Theorem 1.1 and [12, Theorem 4.1], dim(mod ∧
V #k[Zn+1]∗) = dim(mod ∧ V ) = n − 1. Now by Proposition 2.4 and the argument
above, rep.dim(∧V #k[Zn+1]∗) = rep.dim(∧V ) = n + 1.

4.2. Finite representation type. Let A be a G-graded algebra with G a ﬁnite
group. By Proposition 2.8 and Theorem 1.2 we have that A#k[G]∗ is of ﬁnite
representation type if A is. It is Corollary 3 in Section 2 of [8]. Furthermore, if A
is separably graded, then A#k[G]∗ is of ﬁnite representation type only if A is. It
is Theorem 3.2 of [8].
