We analyze the asymptotic scaling of persistence of unvisited sites for quantum walks on a line. In
contrast to the classical random walk there is no connection between the behaviour of persistence and
the scaling of variance. In particular, we ﬁnd that for a two-state quantum walks persistence follows
an inverse power-law where the exponent is determined solely by the coin parameter. Moreover,
for a one-parameter family of three-state quantum walks containing the Grover walk the scaling of
persistence is given by two contributions. The ﬁrst is the inverse power-law. The second contribution
to the asymptotic behaviour of persistence is an exponential decay coming from the trapping nature
of the studied family of quantum walks. In contrast to the two-state walks both the exponent of
the inverse power-law and the decay constant of the exponential decay depend also on the initial
coin state and its coherence. Hence, one can achieve various regimes of persistence by altering the
initial condition, ranging from purely exponential decay to purely inverse power-law behaviour.

INTRODUCTION

Quantum walks [1–3] represent a versatile tool in quan-
tum information processing with applications ranging
from search algorithms [4–7], graph isomorphism testing
[8–10], ﬁnding structural anomalies in graphs [11–13] or
perfect state transfer [14–18]. Moreover, quantum walks
were shown to be universal tools for quantum computa-
tion [19, 20].

One fundamental characterization of classical random
walks on inﬁnite lattices [21] is recurrence or transience.
Random walk is said to be recurrent when the proba-
bility to return to the starting point at some later time
(so-called P´olya number) is unity, and transient other-
wise. In fact, recurrence ensures that any lattice point
is visited with certainty. P´olya has shown [22] that for
unbiased random walks this property depends on the di-
mension of the lattice. In particular, random walks are
recurrent in dimensions 1 and 2 and transient on cubic
and higher dimensional lattices. This result originates
from the diﬀusive behaviour of a classical random walk.
Since measurement has a non-trivial eﬀect on the state
of the quantum system, one has to specify a particu-
lar measurement scheme to extend the concept of recur-
rence to the domain of quantum walks. One possibility
is to consider a scheme [23] where the quantum walk
is restarted from the beginning after the measurement,
and in each iteration one additional step is performed.
In this way the eﬀect of measurement on the quantum
state is minimized. Within this measurement scheme the
P´olya number of a quantum walk depends not only on
the dimension of the lattice, but also on the coin opera-
tor which drives the walk, and in some cases also on the
initial coin state [24]. The ballistic nature of quantum
walks implies that most of them are transient already in
dimension 2. However, some quantum walks, such as the
Grover walk [25–29], show the so-called trapping eﬀect
(or localization). This feature can be employed to con-

struct recurrent quantum walks in arbitrary dimension
[24].

Another scheme is to continue with the quantum walk
evolution after the measurement [30]. The eﬀect of fre-
quent measurement is that the quantum walks are tran-
sient already on a one-dimensional lattice, as follows from
[31]. Recurrence of quantum state within this measure-
ment scheme has been analyzed for general discrete time
unitary evolution in [32]. The authors have found that
the expectation value of the ﬁrst return time is quantized,
i.e.
it is either inﬁnite or an integer. More recently, it
was shown [33] that this property is preserved even in
iterated open quantum dynamics, provided that the cor-
responding superoperator is unital in the relevant part
of the Hilbert space. Moreover, the notion of monitored
recurrence was extended to a ﬁnite-dimensional subspace
in [34]. In such case the averaged expected return time
is a rational number.

Persistence describes the probability that a given site
remains unvisited until certain number of steps. As such,
it can be viewed as a complementary event to that of re-
currence. For classical random walks on a line and a
plane persistence of any site tends to zero for large num-
ber of steps.
In particular, on one-dimensional lattice
persistence obeys an inverse power-law with exponent
1/2, which follows in a straightforward way from the dif-
fusive behaviour of a random walk [35].

In the context of quantum walks persistence was ﬁrst
introduced in [36]. The authors have analyzed persis-
tence for two-state Hadamard walk on a line within the
measurement scheme of [23], i.e. when the quantum walk
is restarted after the measurement.
It was found that
persistence of any site follows an inverse power-law with
exponent determined numerically as λ ≈ 0.318. In con-
trast to the classical case, no clear connection of the ex-
ponent to the spreading properties of the quantum walk
was found.

In the present paper we give analytical explanation of

the results found in [36]. The study of persistence is
extended to a one-parameter set of two-state quantum
walks on a line. We conﬁrm that persistence obeys an
inverse power-law. The exponent is determined solely
by the parameter of the coin operator. Hence, there is
no connection of the exponent to the scaling of variance
like in the classical random walk. Moreover, we analyze
persistence of sites for a set of three-state quantum walks
[37–39] which involves the familiar Grover walk [26–28] as
a special case. We ﬁnd that persistence exhibits a more
complicated asymptotic behaviour. In addition to the in-
verse power-law there is also an exponential decay which
arises from the trapping eﬀect. The analytical results are
obtained using the suitable basis of the coin space formed
by the eigenvectors of the coin operator [39]. Both the
exponent of the inverse power-law and the decay rate of
the exponential decay depend on the coin parameter and,
in contrast to the two-state walk, on the initial coin state
and its coherence. Hence, it is possible to obtain various
regimes of persistence, ranging from pure inverse power-
law to pure exponential decay, by choosing diﬀerent ini-
tial condition. Moreover, we ﬁnd that for some initial
coin states persistence behave diﬀerently for lattice sites
on the positive and negative half-lines.

The paper is organized as follows: In Section II we
review the deﬁnition of persistence of site m within a
particular measurement scheme of [23, 36]. We provide
an estimate of the asymptotic behaviour of persistence
based on the limit density. Section III is dedicated to
the analysis of persistence in two-state quantum walks.
In Section IV we perform similar analysis for a set of
three-state quantum walks. More technical details are
left for Appendices A and B. We conclude and present
an outlook in Section V.

We replace the logarithm by the ﬁrst order Taylor expan-
sion and arrive at

Next, we use the limit density w(v) derived from the
weak-limit theorem [40] to estimate the exact probability
p(m, t) by

In the following we analyze persistence of unvisited sites
for two- and three-state quantum walks on a line. De-
tailed evaluations of the integral (3) are left for the Ap-
pendices.

II. PERSISTENCE OF UNVISITED SITES

III. TWO-STATE WALK ON A LINE

In this Section we brieﬂy introduce persistence of a
given site and provide and estimate of its asymptotic
behaviour. We follow the measurement scheme used in
[23, 36], where the quantum walk is restarted from the
beginning after each measurement. By persistence of a
site m we understand the probability that the particular
lattice point remains unvisited until T steps. Since the
walk starts at the origin of the lattice we only consider
persistence of sites m (cid:54)= 0. We ﬁnd that this probability
is given by [36]

Let us start our analysis with the two-state quantum

walk on a line with the coin operator

(cid:112)1 − ρ2

−ρ

(cid:19) ,

0 < ρ < 1.

C(ρ) =(cid:18)

ρ

(cid:112)1 − ρ2

The coin parameter ρ determines the speed of propaga-
tion of the wave packet on the line [41]. For ρ = 1/√2
we obtain the familiar Hadamard walk [31].

Suppose that the initial coin state of the particle was

Pm(T ) =

T(cid:89)t=1

(1 − p(m, t)),

(1)

|ψC(cid:105) = a|L(cid:105) + b|R(cid:105).

The limiting probability density for the two-state quan-
tum walk is given by [42, 43]

where p(m, t) denotes the probability to ﬁnd the quantum
particle at position m after t steps of the quantum walk.
Let us now turn to the approximation of persistence
for large T . For this purpose we re-write (1) in the ex-

w(v) =

ρ

(1 − vΛ(a, b))

√1−ρ2
π (1 − v2)(cid:113)1 − v2

ρ2

,

where Λ is determined by the initial coin state and the
coin parameter

Λ(a, b) = |a|2 − |b|2 +(cid:112)1 − ρ2

ρ

(cid:0)ab + ba(cid:1) .

Before we turn to the persistence we ﬁrst simplify the
dependence on the initial coin state Λ by changing the
basis of the coin space. Following the idea of [44] we
consider the basis formed by the eigenvectors of the coin
operator

2 |R(cid:105),

|χ+(cid:105) =(cid:114) 1 + ρ
|χ−(cid:105) = −(cid:114) 1 − ρ

2 |L(cid:105) +(cid:114) 1 − ρ
2 |L(cid:105) +(cid:114) 1 + ρ
C(ρ)|χ±(cid:105) = ±|χ±(cid:105).

2 |R(cid:105),

which satisfy the relations

(5)

We decompose the initial coin state of the walk into the
eigenvector basis as

|ψC(cid:105) = h+|χ+(cid:105) + h−|χ−(cid:105).

From (5) we ﬁnd that the coeﬃcients of the initial coin
state in the standard basis a and b are related to the
eigenbasis coeﬃcients h± by

a =

b =

√1 + ρ
√2
√1 − ρ
√2

h+ −

h+ +

√1 − ρ
√2
√1 + ρ
√2

h−,

h−.

In the new basis the factor Λ(a, b) becomes

Λ(h+, h−) =

2|h+|2 − 1

ρ

.

The asymptotic probability density thus simpliﬁes into

w(v) =

(6)

ρ

ρ (2|h+|2 − 1)(cid:17)

√1−ρ2
(cid:16)1 − v
π (1 − v2)(cid:113)1 − v2

ρ2

Let us now turn to persistence. We leave the details
of evaluation of the integral (4) for Appendix A. We ﬁnd
that for large T the function Im(T ) grows like a logarithm

where the pre-factor reads

Im(T ) ∼ λ ln(cid:18) T
|m|(cid:19) ,
λ = (cid:112)1 − ρ2

ρπ

.

(7)

Hence, we ﬁnd that in the asymptotic regime persistence
of site m follows an inverse power-law

Pm(T ) ∼(cid:18) T

|m|(cid:19)−λ

,

(8)

The exponent λ is independent of the initial coin state.
It is determined solely by the coin operator, i.e. by the
value of ρ. Note that for ρ = 1/√2, i.e. the Hadamard
walk, we ﬁnd that λ = 1
π ≈ 0.318, which is in agreement
with the numerical result obtained in [36].

have chosen the initial coin state |ψ(1)

Our results are illustrated in Figures 1-3. In Figure 1
we show the inﬂuence of the initial coin state.
In the
ﬁrst two plots we display the probability distribution
of the two-state quantum walk with the coin parameter
ρ = 1/√2, i.e. the Hadamard walk. In all Figures grey
circles represent the data-points obtained from numerical
simulation. The red curves correspond to the asymptotic
probability density given by (6). For the upper plot we
C (cid:105) = |χ−(cid:105). The re-
sulting probability density shows only one peak on the
right. In the middle plot the initial coin state was chosen
(|χ+(cid:105) + |χ−(cid:105)). This state leads
to a symmetric distribution. Despite the diﬀerences in
the probability distributions the persistence shows the
same asymptotic scaling, as we illustrate in the last ﬁg-
ure. Here we display the persistence of site m = 2 as a
function of the number of steps T . To unravel the in-
verse power-law behavior we use log-log scale. The grey
circles correspond to the numerical simulation and the
red curves show the inverse power-law (8).

according to |ψ(2)

C (cid:105) = 1√2

In Figure 2 we illustrate the inﬂuence of the coin pa-
rameter ρ. In the ﬁrst two plots we show the probability
distribution of the two-state quantum walk with the ini-
tial coin state |ψC(cid:105) = 1√2
(|χ+(cid:105) + |χ−(cid:105)). For the upper
plot the coin parameter is ρ1 = 0.2. In the middle plot we
have chosen the coin parameter ρ2 = 0.8. We see that
the coin parameter directly aﬀects the speed at which
the walk spreads through the lattice [41]. The lower plot
shows the diﬀerence in the scaling of persistence of site
m = 2 for diﬀerent values of ρ. We use log-log scale to
unravel the scaling of persistence. We ﬁnd that the expo-
nent of the inverse power-law decreases with increasing
value of ρ, in accordance with (7).

Finally, Figure 3 illustrates that the asymptotic be-
haviour of persistence is independent of the actual posi-
tion m. The upper plot displays the probability distribu-
tion of the two-state walk with coin parameter ρ = 0.5
and the initial coin state |ψC(cid:105) = |χ+(cid:105). This initial condi-
tion leads to a density which is the most biased towards
left, as indicated by the presence of only one peak. In
the lower plot we show persistence of sites m = 2 and
m = −2 on a log-log scale. Despite the diﬀerences in
the intermediate regime, the slope of both curves is the
same, in agreement with (8).

To conclude this Section, we have found that for the
two-state quantum walk on a line persistence of unvisited
sites obeys an inverse power-law (8) with exponent (7)
determined only by the coin parameter.

1/
the Hadamard walk after t = 100 steps for two diﬀerent initial
coin states |ψ(1,2)
(cid:105) on a semi-log scale. In the lower plot we
display persistence of site m = 2 as a function of the number
of steps T on a log-log scale. Despite the diﬀerences in the
probability distributions the asymptotic scaling of persistence
is independent of the initial state, in accordance with (8).

IV. THREE-STATE WALK ON A LINE

Let us now turn to the three-state walk on a line. Here
the particle is allowed to move to the left, stay at its po-
sition or move to the right. We denote the corresponding
orthogonal coin states by |L(cid:105), |S(cid:105) and |R(cid:105). As for the
coin operator we consider the one which was studied in

FIG. 2. Probability density and persistence in dependence on
the choice of the coin parameter ρ. The ﬁrst two plots show
the probability distribution of the two-state quantum walk on
a semi-log scale. In both situations the initial coin state was
chosen as |ψC(cid:105) = 1√
(|χ+(cid:105) + |χ−(cid:105)), which leads to symmetric
probability distribution. In the upper plot the coin parameter
is ρ1 = 0.2 while in the middle plot we have chosen ρ2 = 0.8.
The lower plot shows scaling of persistence of site m = 2 for
diﬀerent values of ρ1,2 on a log-log scale. The exponent of the
inverse power-law (8) decreases with increasing value of ρ, as
predicted by (7).

The limit density w(v) and the trapping probability
p∞(m) were analyzed in [38, 39]. We follow the results of
[39] since they have simpler form due to the use of a more
suitable basis of the coin space. In particular, the basis
of the coin space was constructed from the eigenvectors
of the coin operator (9) which reads

C(ρ)|σ+(cid:105) = |σ+(cid:105),

We decompose the initial coin state into the eigenstate
basis according to

|ψC(cid:105) = g+|σ+(cid:105) + g1|σ−1 (cid:105) + g2|σ−2 (cid:105).

with parameter ρ ∈ (0, 1). Quantum walks with such
a coin operator represent a one-parameter extension of
the familiar three-state Grover walk [26–28], which cor-
responds to the choice of ρ = 1/√3. Indeed, the results
of [39] have shown that the considered quantum walks
share the same features and the coin factor ρ is a scaling
parameter which determines the rate of spreading of the
three-state quantum walk across the line.

To evaluate persistence of unvisited sites we estimate
the exact probability distribution p(m, t) for large num-
ber of steps t. In contrast to the two-state walk, the prop-
erties of the probability distribution are not fully cap-
tured by the limit density w(v). Indeed, the three-state
quantum walk leads to the trapping eﬀect [26–28, 38, 39],
which means that the probability of ﬁnding the particle
at position m has a non-vanishing limit for t approaching
inﬁnity. We denote the limiting value

p(m, t) = p∞(m),

as the trapping probability. Hence, for large t we approx-
imate the probability to ﬁnd the particle at position m

We conclude that for the three-state quantum walk on a
line persistence of site m behaves asymptotically like

(12)

We see that there are two contributions to persistence.
Similarly to the two-state walk there is an inverse power-
law. In addition, the trapping eﬀect contributes with the
exponential decay. However, the behavior of persistence
depends on the initial state, in contrast to the two-state
walk. Indeed, both λ and the trapping probability p∞(m)
are determined by the initial condition. The exponent λ
depends only on the probability |g2|2 to ﬁnd the initial
coin state |ψC(cid:105) in the eigenstate |σ−2 (cid:105). On the other
hand, the rate of the exponential decay is determined
by the interference of the amplitudes g+ and g2. In the
following we discuss various initial conditions to illustrate
our result.

Let us ﬁrst consider the initial coin state |ψC(cid:105) = |σ+(cid:105).
In such a case the general formula (12) for the asymptotic
behaviour of persistence turns into

(15)

We see that both contributions, namely the inverse
power-law and the exponential decay, are present. For
illustration of this result, we show in Figure 4 the proba-
bility distribution and persistence for the three-state walk
with the coin parameter ρ = 0.8. The ﬁrst plot displays
the probability distribution after t = 100 steps. The grey
circles corresponds to the numerical simulation, the red
curve depicts the asymptotic probability density (10) and
the blue dashed curve corresponds to the trapping prob-
ability (11). The second plot illustrates persistence of
sites m = 2 and m = 10 on the log-log scale. For m = 2
the decay of persistence is faster than inverse power-law.
Indeed, for large number of steps the exponential decay

6

starts to play a dominant role. On the other hand, for
m = 10 we do not observe any deviation from the inverse
power-law at the considered time-scale. This is due to
the fact that the decay constant (15) itself decreases ex-
ponentially with the distance from the origin. The last
plot, where we display persistence of site m = 2 on the
logarithmic scale, illustrates that Pm(T ) decays exponen-
tially in the long-time limit.
Let us now turn to the initial coin state |ψC(cid:105) = |σ−2 (cid:105).
The general formula for persistence of site m (12) for
g2 = 1 reduces into purely exponential decay

m (T ) ∼ e−γ(m)T ,
P (g2)

(16)

where the decay rate γ(m) is given by (15). To illustrate
this eﬀect, we display in Figure 5 the probability distribu-
tion and persistence for the Grover walk, i.e. ρ = 1/√3.
The ﬁrst plot shows the probability distribution after
t = 100 steps. The second plot displays persistence of
sites m = 1, m = 2 and m = 5. The decay rate (15)
decreases exponentially with the growing distance from
the origin. Hence, already for m = 5 persistence essen-
tially saturates on the considered time-scale. The last
plot shows persistence of site m = 2 on a log-scale. The
ﬁgure illustrates that the decay of persistence is indeed
purely exponential.

Next, we consider the initial coin state |ψC(cid:105) = |σ−1 (cid:105). In
such a case the expression (12) reduces to a pure inverse
power-law

m (T ) ∼(cid:18) T
P (g1)

|m|(cid:19)−λ

,

(17)

with the exponent λ given by (14). To illustrate this fea-
ture, we show in Figure 6 the probability distribution and
persistence for the three-state walk with the coin param-
eter ρ = 0.6. The upper plot displays the probability dis-
tribution after 100 steps. We ﬁnd that for the particular
initial state |ψC(cid:105) = |σ−1 (cid:105) the trapping eﬀect disappears.
Indeed, according to (11) we ﬁnd that p∞(m) vanishes if
g+ = g2 = 0. The lower plot displays persistence of sites
m = 2 and m = 5. The log-log scale unravels that the
scaling is given only by the inverse power-law (17).

Finally, let us point out that the dependence of the
trapping probability (11) on the initial coin state can
be diﬀerent for positive and negative m. This leads to
diﬀerent behavior of persistence for sites on positive and
negative half-lines. As an example, consider the initial
coin state

|ψC(cid:105) =

1

√2(cid:0)|σ+(cid:105) + |σ−2 (cid:105)(cid:1) .

(18)

We ﬁnd that persistence of sites on positive half-line
(m > 0) behaves like

after t = 100 steps. The second plot displays persistence (13)
of sites m = 2 and m = 10 on the log-log scale. For m =
2 the decay of persistence is faster than the inverse power-
law. The deviation is due to the exponential decay which
starts to play a dominant role for large T . We do not observe
this eﬀect for m = 10, since the decay constant decreases
exponentially with the distance from the origin. The third
plot, which shows persistence of site m = 2 on the log-scale,
conﬁrms that Pm(T ) decays exponentially.

walk. Notice that the trapping probability, highlighted
by the dashed blue curve, is non-zero only on the positive
half-line. The lower plot illustrates the diﬀerence in the
scaling of persistence for sites on the positive or negative
half-lines. Here we show persistence of sites m = 2 and
m = −2 on the log-log scale. We ﬁnd that for m = −2
the behavior of persistence is determined only by the in-
verse power-law (21). On the other hand, for m = 2 the
decrease of persistence is faster. Indeed, for positive m
the behavior of persistence is dominated by the exponen-
tial decay (19) in the long-time limit. This is illustrated
in the last plot, where we show persistence of site m = 2
on the log-scale.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In the present paper persistence of unvisited sites for
two- and three-state quantum walks on a line was ana-
lyzed. We have found that in contrast to the classical
random walk there is no connection between the asymp-
totic behavior of persistence and scaling of the variance
with the number of steps. Concerning the two-state walk,
we have analytically conﬁrmed the numerical result ob-
tained in [36] for the Hadamard walk. Moreover, we have
extended the analysis to a one-parameter set of two-state
quantum walks. In particular, we have shown that per-
sistence of unvisited sites obeys an inverse power-law in-
dependent of the initial condition and the actual position
of the site. The exponent of the inverse power-law is de-
termined by the parameter of the coin operator.

The main result of the paper is the behaviour of per-
sistence for three-state quantum walks. We have focused
on a one-parameter family of walks which includes the
familiar three-state Grover walk. Due to the trapping
eﬀect displayed by the considered set of quantum walks,
the behaviour of persistence is more involved than for the
two-state quantum walks. In particular, we have shown
that the asymptotic scaling of persistence is in general de-
termined by a combination of an inverse power-law and
an exponential decay. However, both the exponent of
the inverse power-law and the decay rate of the expo-
nential decline depend on the initial coin state. There-
fore, it is possible to obtain various asymptotic regimes of
persistence by choosing proper initial conditions. More-
over, one can employ the asymmetry of the trapping ef-
fect to achieve diﬀerent asymptotic scaling of persistence
for sites on the positive and negative half-line. All ob-
tained results have been facilitated by using a suitable
basis formed by the eigenvectors of the coin operator.
This allows to express persistence in closed and compact
form and trace back the ways it is inﬂuenced by the initial
state and its coherence.

The present study is limited to the quantum walks on
a line. A natural extension is to consider persistence of
unvisited sites in quantum walks on higher-dimensional
lattices. It would be interesting if similar eﬀects, such as

state walk with ρ = 0.6 starting with the coin state |ψC(cid:105) =

−
t = 100 steps. For this particular initial state the trapping
eﬀect disappears. The lower plot displays persistence of sites
m = 2 and m = 5 on a log-log scale. We ﬁnd that the scaling
is given by the inverse power-law (17).

(21)

with the exponent λ given by (20). We point out that
coherence of the initial coin state is crucial for this ef-
fect. Indeed, consider the initial coin state given by an
incoherent mixture of the basis states

ρC =

2|σ+(cid:105)(cid:104)σ+| +

2|σ−2 (cid:105)(cid:104)σ−2 |.

In such a case persistence is given by the sum of the ex-
pressions (16) and (17) with the corresponding exponent
(14) and decay rate (15), independent of the sign of the
position m. Hence, there is no asymmetry between neg-
ative and positive m and persistence of all lattice sites
decays exponentially in the asymptotic regime. Com-
pared to the coherent superposition (18) the exponent
(14) is larger by a factor of two while the decay rate (15)
is smaller by a factor of two.

We illustrate the results for the initial coin state (18) in

tial (19), as we illustrate in the last plot with the logarithmic
scale.

Appendix A: Integral Im(T ) for a two-state walk

We dedicate this appendix to evaluating integral
Im(T ) deﬁned in (3) for the two-state walk. The limit
density w(v) is given by the formula (6). Since the limit
density (6) is non-zero only for |v| ≤ ρ, we replace the
lower bound in the integral (3) with |m|/ρ. With the
substitution u = m

ρt we rewrite Im(T ) into the form
