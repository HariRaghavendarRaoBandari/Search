Abstract—To attain seamless handover and reduce the han-
dover failure probability for high-speed railway (HSR) com-
munication systems, this paper proposes a remote antenna unit
(RAU) selection assisted handover scheme where two antennas
are installed on high speed train (HST) and distributed antenna
system (DAS) cell architecture on ground is adopted. The RAU
selection is used to provide high quality received signals for
trains moving in DAS cells and the two HST antennas are
employed on trains to realize seamless handover. Moreover,
to efﬁciently evaluate the system performance, a new met-
ric termed as handover occurrence probability is deﬁned for
describing the relation between handover occurrence position
and handover failure probability. We then analyze the received
signal strength, the handover trigger probability, the handover
occurrence probability, the handover failure probability and the
communication interruption probability. Numerical results are
provided to compare our proposed scheme with the current
existing ones. It is shown that our proposed scheme achieves
better performances in terms of handover failure probability and
communication interruption probability.

I. INTRODUCTION

Recently, high-speed railway (HSR) system has developed
very fast owing to its convenience and safety. Meanwhile,
the wireless service demand during the trip of high-speed
train (HST) grows dramatically but this demand is hard to be
satisﬁed, since there are various challenges in the broadband
wireless communication for HSR systems [1]. One of the
biggest challenges is how to provide seamless handover with
low handover failure probability for HSR system.

Firstly, due to the high mobility speed of HST, the han-
dover occurs very frequently which interrupts the wireless
connection intermittently. Secondly, the remote base station
(BS) providing radio signals with poor strength causes a
high handover failure probability and degrades the quality of
service, especially, in the boundary region of two neighboring
cells.

Aiming at releasing these problems, a lot of research work
have been done in the literature [2] - [6]. To release the ﬁrst
problem, two-HST antennas were adopted in [2], in which
during the handover, the front antenna of the train carries

out handover while the rear antenna keeps connecting with
BS. After the front antenna completes establishing connection
with the target BS,
the rear one switches to the working
frequency of the target BS. However, due to the near-far
signal prorogation effect, the seamless handover of such a
conﬁguration is still difﬁcult to be ensured, especially when
the base stations are relatively far way from the train. To
release the second problem, the distributed antenna system
(DAS) cell architecture was introduced to HSR systems [3],
[4], which also improves the system supported data rate as the
remote antenna unit deduces the distance between the BS and
the train. To inherit the advantages of both two-HST antennas
and DAS cells, [5] and [6] investigated them in a single HSR
system to improve the handover performance, where however,
only traditional/blanket transmission scheme was considered.
In the traditional/blanket transmission scheme, each BS
allocates its available power to its RAUs equally, even during
the handover procedure, which neglects the difference of the
links between the RAUs and the train antennas. Since the
RAUs are usually deployed along the track, there is always one
RAU being the closest to the train and other ones are relatively
far away from the train. Therefore, the closest RAU should
consume all power to achieve a better system performance,
rather than all RAUs equally dividing up the power. From
this motivation, different from [5] and [6], we adopt
the
remote antenna unit (RAU) selection to enhance the handover
performance of HSR system based on two-HST antennas and
DAS cells. In our proposed scheme, the available power of
each BS is always allocated to the RAU with the minimum
pathloss according to the position of the train. As a result, the
received signal strength (RSS) at the train can be improved,
so does the handover performance.

The contribution of our work can be summarized as follows.
Firstly, we investigate the handover scheme for HST commu-
nication systems, which is the ﬁrst work on introducing the
RAU selection in DAS cells to enhance the handover per-
formance of HSR system with two-HST antennas. Secondly,
we present a new performance metric named as handover
occurrence probability to describe the relation between han-
dover occurrence position and handover performance. Based
on this metric, we obtain one signiﬁcant insight. That is,
the appropriate handover position can reduce handover failure

probability greatly. Thirdly, The system performance of our
proposed scheme in handover trigger probability1, handover
failure probability and communication interruption probability
are analyzed in theory and numerical results shows its advan-
tages over the current exiting ones.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II
describes the system model. Section III presents our proposed
handover scheme. The analytical results and the numerical
results are presented are provided in Section IV and Section
V, respectively. Finally, Section VI summarizes this paper.

II. SYSTEM MODEL

A. System Architecture

Consider a HSR system, where a train is running at a
constant speed v on a straight railway track. The passengers in
the train expect a high quality wireless communication service
during the trip. To satisfy this requirement and provide broad-
band wireless communication for the HST, two conﬁgurations,
(i) two-HST antennas and (ii) DAS cells, are involved in our
system, which are described as follows.

1) Two-HST antennas: In this conﬁguration, two antennas
are deployed on the top of the train which are characterized
by the front antenna and the rear antenna. The distance of
two antennas is set as the length of HST. These two antennas
are connected with a Train relay station (TRS) inside the
train carriage also by optical ﬁber links, which is used to
provide a cooperative communication service between users
and cells along the railway. It means that all information
transmitted from (or sent to) the users are aggregated and
forwarded by the TRS. By dosing so, all users in the train can
be considered as a single “big user” connecting with TRS, so
that the group handover (i.e., all active users simultaneously
requiring handover) from the serving cell to the target cell can
be released by executing the handover of the “big user”. When
the train moves within the coverage of one DAS cell, both HST
antennas communicate with the serving cells and TRS receives
the signals from two antennas by using maximal-ratio combin-
ing (MRC) method. When the train moves into the overlap area
of two neighboring cells, the front antenna executes handover
to the target cell (also termed as the next cell) while the rear
antenna keeps connecting with the serving cell (also termed
as the current cell), so that a seamless communication service
can be provided during handover procedure. Actually, two-
HST antennas can not only improve the channel capacity by
using space diversity but also help to avoid the penetration
loss by using the two-hop BS-TRS-user link transmission.

2) DAS cells: Different from the traditional cell which has
a centralized antenna array at the base station (BS), one DAS
cell is formed by a master BS and N RAUs which physically
connect with the master BS by optical ﬁber links. As shown
in Fig. 1, RAUs are distributed along the railway to provide a
high-quality seamless coverage of radio signals to HST. The
master BS deliver data from core network to each RAU via
optical ﬁbers. It is assumed that the optical ﬁbre links are
able to provide super high data rate, so the transmission delay

between the BS and the RAU is neglected. With each DAS
cell, the quality of radio signals over both downlink and uplink
can be greatly enhanced by reducing the transmission distance
between the serving cell and the antennas of HST. Since there
are usually more data transmission in downlink compared with
uplink, this paper mainly focuses on the downlink scenario.

As shown in Fig. 1, ds is the distance between two neighbor-
ing (master) BSs, dr is the distance between two neighboring
RAUs in one DAS cell, d0 is the distance between (master) BS
and railway, du is the distance between RAUs and railway, and
L is the length of HST. The train location x is measured by the
distance between the front antenna and original point which
is the cross point between railway track and its vertical line
through the serving (master) BS. For clarity, we use n and i to
represent the n-th RAU of a DAS cell and the i-th antenna of
HST respectively, where 0 ≤ n ≤ N , and i ∈ {1, 2}, where
“1” represents the front antenna and “2” represents the tail
antenna.

B. Received Signal Strength (RSS)

RSS is a vital parameter usually adopted in investigating
handover scheme. As previously mentioned, the two antennas
perform handover separately.

It was proved in [2] that the handover schemes are not
sensitive to small-scale fading and the inter-carrier interference
(ICI) and noise component could be averaged out of RSS
which has no effect on the ﬁnal average signal strength.
Therefore, at time t, the train location x is v · t and the RSS
at the i-th antenna from the n-th RAU2 in the cell s is

where s ∈ {TC, SC}. SC and TC represent the serving cell
and the target cell, respectively. Pn is the transmit power of
n-th RAU in s-th cell, Pn ≤ Pt, Pt is the constraint power
of s-th cell, PL (d) = A · d−γ is the path loss, where A is a
constant, d is the distance, γ is the path loss exponent. ζ is

Since two-HST antennas are employed, during the handover
these two antennas shall connect with serving cell and target
cell respectively, thus two independent transmission links are
constructed. As for how to keep two links synchronous, we
adopt a transmission scheme named as dual-casting which
is very similar with the bi-casting [7]. In this transmission
scheme two copies of data are sent from the core network to
both the serving cell and the target cell during handover by
optical ﬁber links which are regarded as no delay. Then the
serving cell and the target cell provide the same information
to the rear antenna and the front antenna synchronously by
RAUs.

Fig. 2 shows the procedures of our proposed handover

scheme and the details are given as follows.

a. Handover preparation
1) HST issues the Measurement Report including the RSS
of two antennas from TRS to the serving cell periodi-
cally. If the serving cell decides to trigger a handover for
the front antenna, it sends a handover request message
including the selected RAU index to the target cell.

2) The target cell makes an admission control & conﬁgure
and allocates transmission power according to the index
message. Then it sends a handover request ACK to the
serving cell.

b. Handover Execution
3) The serving cell continues transmitting data received
from the core network to the rear antenna of HST.
Meanwhile, the target cell requests one duplicated data
from the core network by dual-casting.

4) Once TRS receives the Handover Command of the front
antenna from the serving cell, the front antenna breaks
the connection with the serving cell and establishes a
new connection with the selected RAU in the target cell.
5) When the rear antenna enters the overlap region and
receives the handover command from the serving cell
which decides to trigger a handover for it based on the
Measurement Report, it starts a handover procedure and
connects with the target cell.

c. Handover Completion
6) When the rear antenna ﬁnishes the handover, the serving
cell requests to ﬁnish dual-casting and the core network
makes a request ACK. Then, the data is only transmitted
to the target cell and the serving cell releases the
resource associated to the TRS.

In this procedure, the handover of two antennas occurs at
different time, so it can be ensured that at least one antenna
receives data from the core network by the serving cell or
target cell. Therefore, the passengers in the train can enjoy an
seamless wireless communication service.

III. HANDOVER SCHEME

This section ﬁrstly presents the handover condition based
on the RAU selection. Then a dual-cast transmission scheme
from the core network to fully utilize the two-HST antennas.
At last the details of handover procedure are presented.

A. Handover Condition

As there are multiple RAUs in each DAS cell, several
transmission schemes, such as the blanket transmission scheme
and RAU selection transmission scheme [4], can be adopted
for the information transmission in a DAS cell. The blanket
transmission scheme transmits signals through all RAUs and
the power is allocated equally for all RAUs. The RAU se-
lection transmission scheme selects one RAU with minimum
propagation pathloss for transmission. Compared with blanket
transmission scheme, RAU selection transmission scheme is
more suitable for HSR system according to [3]. Thus, we adopt
the later one in our handover scheme.

The RAU selection is employed i) for the serving cell to
allocate all available power to one RAU for transmission which
is closet to the HST; ii) for the target cell to allocate all power
to its ﬁrst RAU during the handover procedure.

In this case, the RSS at i-th antenna from the n-th RAU in

where R(s)
is the RSS at the i-th antenna from the cell s
and H is the protection factor, which is used to avoiding the
Ping-Pang effect during handover.

To evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, we an-
alyze four different metrics, i.e., the handover trigger probabil-
ity, the handover occurrence probability, the handover failure

probability and the communication interruption probability for
it. It is worth noting that in the following analysis, the position
of train’s front antenna x is regarded as the reference and we
consider the period of [0, ds].

Before the analysis, we ﬁrst drive the CDF and the PDF of
the transmission link. As mentioned previously, for each cell,
only one RAU is selected to transmit signals, so the CDF of

A. Handover Trigger Probability

Handover trigger probability is the probability of that the
handover trigger condition is met at position x. Based on
the distribution of RSS and handover condition, the handover
trigger probability of i-th antenna of HST can be given by (5).

B. Handover Occurrence Probability

Handover occurrence probability is the probability of that
the handover occurs at position x, which means that at position
x the handover condition is met and before it the handover is
not triggered (i.e., the handover condition is not met before
x). The handover occurrence probability of the i-th antennas
on HST in the proposed scheme can be given by (7).

C. Handover Failure Probability

Handover failure occurs when the handover condition is
met but the average RSS from the target cell is lower than a
threshold T which is the minimum RSS to maintain a wireless
communication. So the handover failure probability of the i-th
antenna of HST can be expressed as

and it can be rewritten as (9) for our proposed handover
transmission scheme.

D. Communication Interruption Probability

Communication interruption of i-th antenna means that
during the trip of HST, RSS from the serving cell3 is lower
than T , resulting in wireless link failure. It is an important
metric to evaluate the quality of wireless communication
service and can be given by

As for our proposed handover scheme, the communication
interruption occurs only when both two antennas fail
to
connect to the serving cell. As the channels between the
two antennas and the BS are independent, the communication
interruption probability can be given by

P (out) (x, T ) =Y2

It can be seen from (11) that two-HST antennas is useful in
improving the communication interruption performance during
the trip of the HST.

V. NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Some numerical results are provided to show the perfor-
mance of our proposed handover scheme here. For compari-
son, three other schemes are also simulated, i.e., i) two-HST
antennas and DAS cells with blanket transmission scheme
(DAS-B), ii) single HST antenna and DAS cells with RAU
selection transmission scheme (DAS-S) and iii) two-HST
antennas and traditional cells. Particularly, as for the RSS of
DAS-B, it is a sum of lognormal variables which does not
have a closed-form probability distribution function, so we use
the moment generating function (MGF) [8] to approximate it.

3When i-th antenna ﬁnishes the handover, its former target cell becomes

the serving cell.

Fig. 3 shows RSS of four different schemes during the
period of interest, i.e., [0, ds]. It can be seen that the proposed
scheme has the highest RSS in most time and the DAS-B has
the second-highest RSS. Compared with DAS-S, employing
two-HST antennas in our proposed scheme yields a higher
RSS. Compared with traditional cells which only has a higher
RSS for x = 0 and x = 3000, the proposed scheme can
improve the quality of RSS by reducing the transmission
distance with RAUs.

Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 present the handover trigger probability
and handover occurrence probability versus the position x. It
is known that an efﬁcient handover scheme expects handover
occurrence position around the middle point of two neighbor-
ing cells. Since there is a protection factor, the appropriate
handover occurrence point shall shift a little to the target

cell. The optimal handover trigger probability should change
from 0 to 1 dramatically when the train passes the appropriate
handover occurrence point. In this sense, our proposed scheme
does obtain a better performance than traditional one. It is
noted that all the curves intersect around the point with x-
coordinate of 1500 in Fig. 4, which is the middle point of the
two neighboring BS.

In Fig. 6, the proposed scheme achieves a lower handover
failure probability compared with DAS-B in the boundary
region. Since the handover trigger probability of these two
schemes is similar, the difference in this performance is caused
by the variance of RSS between target cell and serving cell.
The proposed scheme can achieve a better performance be-
cause the RAU selection transmission scheme always allocates

the power to the RAU closet to HST and makes the transmis-
sion suffer minimum pathloss. As for DAS-S and traditional
cell, the former one has a similar performance in handover
failure probability with the proposed scheme and the later one
always suffers a very high handover failure probability since
the BSs are too far away from HST when the train is moving
in the boundary region. Based on Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, a very
important insight is observed that there exists an appropriate
position with high-quality received signals for activating the
handover to get very low handover failure probability. Such a
position is often near to the middle point of the overlap of two
neighboring cells and highly depends on the handover trigger
RSS protection factor.

Fig. 7 plots the communication interruption probability of
three different schemes all adopting DAS cells during the
overlap. It can be observed that our proposed scheme has the
lowest communication interruption probability among the four
discussed schemes. This certiﬁcates that the RAU selection
transmission scheme provides a better RSS.

VI. CONCLUSION

This paper proposed a RAU selection assisted handover
scheme for HSR system, which adopted two-HST antennas
and DAS cells to provide seamless wireless coverage and
improve the quality of RSS so that
the handover failure
probability could be reduced. The expressions of the received
signal strength, the handover trigger probability, the handover
occurrence probability, the handover failure probability and
the communication interruption probability of our proposed
method were derived. Both the analytical and simulation
the proposed handover scheme achieves
results show that

a better handover performance compared with the current
existing ones.
