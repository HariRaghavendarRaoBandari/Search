FINITE ORBITS FOR NILPOTENT ACTIONS ON THE TORUS

S. FIRMO AND J. RIB ´ON

ABSTRACT. A homeomorphism of the 2-torus with Lefschetz number different from zero
has a ﬁxed point. We give a version of this result for nilpotent groups of diffeomorphisms.
We prove that a nilpotent group of 2-torus diffeomorphims has ﬁnite orbits when the group
has some element with Lefschetz number different from zero.

1. INTRODUCTION

Abelian groups of isotopic to the identity C 1- diffeomorphisms of closed oriented sur-
faces different from the 2-sphere and the 2-torus have global ﬁxed points [9, Franks-
Handel-Parwani]. They prove also that if the surface is the 2-sphere then such groups
have ﬁnite orbits with at most two elements [8]. This result was generalized to nilpotent
groups by the second author [15]. For the 2-torus, in the above conditions, we can not
guarantee neither the existence of global ﬁxed points nor the existence of ﬁnite orbits for
the groups.

In this context when the surface is different from the 2-torus the existence of global ﬁxed
points or ﬁnite orbits is essentially imposed by the surface topology and the dynamics of
the nilpotent (or abelian) relation on the group. Several papers have focused on this issue
as [2, 3, 11, 5, 8, 9, 1] on the abelian case, and as [4, 15, 7] for the nilpotent ones.

When the surface is the 2-torus T2 we need to impose more conditions on the groups,
other than the nilpotent property, to guarantee the existence of global ﬁxed points or ﬁnite
orbits. We can do this by imposing on the nilpotent groups certain conditions either of
topological nature or of more dynamical structure. In this article we consider the ﬁrst
approach to guarantee the existence of ﬁnite orbits. The latter point of view is studied in
the forthcoming article Global ﬁxed points for nilpotent actions on the torus (cf. [6]).

A natural topological condition on G ⊂ Diﬀ1(T2) to obtain ﬁnite orbits is the existence
of some element in G whose Lefschetz number is different from zero. Such property plays
the role of a rigidity condition on the nilpotent group G. It allows to show the following
result.

Theorem 1.1. Let G be a nilpotent subgroup of Diﬀ 1(T2) . If G has some element whose
Lefschetz number is different from zero then G has a ﬁnite orbit.

Here, Diﬀ 1(T2) denotes the set of C 1-diffeomorphisms of the 2-torus.

The Lefschetz ﬁxed point theorem guarantees a ﬁxed point for each element of G
whose Lefschetz number is different from zero. But the existence of such an element
is not sufﬁcient to guarantee a global ﬁxed point since for instance G may have some ele-
ments without ﬁxed points. This is the case for the abelian subgroup G of Diﬀ1( S1× S1)
generated by the maps

ψ(z1, z2) = (¯z1, ¯z2)

and φ(z1, z2) = (−z1, −z2) where

z1, z2 ∈ S1 ⊂ C.

In this example φ has no ﬁxed point and the Lefschetz number of ψ is equal to 4.

Theorem 1.1 provides a natural version, in the torus T2 and for the C 1- differentiability
class, of some result proved by Ghys for the 2-sphere in the analytic case. In [10] Ghys
proves the following theorem.

Theorem (Ghys). Nilpotent groups of analytic diffeomorphisms of S2 have ﬁnite orbits.

Naturally, in the result of Ghys, the identity map is an element with Lefschetz number
different from zero. The arguments in the proofs of these two results are very different and
it is not clear at all how to generalize the real analytic arguments to the C 1 case for S2 or
others closed oriented surfaces with Euler characteristic different from zero.

At the end of this article we present versions of Theorem 1.1 for the case where the

surface is the Klein bottle, the compact annulus and the compact M¨obius strip.

To address our question let us consider a homeomorphism φ of the torus T2 that be-
longs to the connected component of the identity, Homeo0(T2) , of Homeo(T2). Let ˜φ
be a lift of φ to the universal covering R2 of T2. Following [14], the rotation vectors of
˜φ are the limits of sequences of the form

˜φ nk(˜xk) − ˜xk

nk

compact and convex subset of R2.

where (nk)k≥1 is an increasing sequence of positive integers and (˜xk)k≥1 is a sequence of

points in R2. This set will be denoted by ρ(cid:0) ˜φ(cid:1). We know from [14] that it is a non-empty
Equivalently we know that ρ(cid:0) ˜φ(cid:1) = (cid:8)ρµ(cid:0) ˜φ(cid:1) ; µ ∈ P(φ)(cid:9) where P(φ) is the set of

φ-invariant Borel probability measures and

ρµ(cid:0) ˜φ(cid:1) :=ZT2(cid:0) ˜φ − Id(cid:1) dµ .

Notice that since φ belongs to Homeo0(T2) then ˜φ commutes with the covering trans-

formations and ˜φ − Id is a well-deﬁned map in T2. The set ρ(cid:0) ˜φ(cid:1) depends on the lift
˜φ of φ but it satisﬁes ρ(cid:0)Tv ◦ ˜φ(cid:1) = Tv(cid:0)ρ(cid:0) ˜φ(cid:1)(cid:1) where Tv is the translation in R2 by the
vector v ∈ Z2. In particular the projection ρ(φ) of ρ(cid:0) ˜φ(cid:1) in R2/Z2 depends on φ but it

does not depend on the lift ˜φ of φ.
Conventions. From now on, we make the following conventions. A homeomorphism
˜ψ ∈ Homeo(R2) always denotes a lift to the universal covering of ψ ∈ Homeo(T2)

NILPOTENT ACTIONS ON THE TORUS

and vice-versa. Moreover, π : R2 → T2 denotes the universal covering map and unless
explicitly stated otherwise a lift means a lift to the universal covering.

Given a subgroup G of Homeo(T2) we always denote by G0 the subgroup of isotopic
to the identity elements of G. We say that an element φ ∈ G0 is P(G)-irrotational if
P(G) 6= ∅ and there exists a lift ˜φ ∈ Homeo0(R2) of φ such that ρµ( ˜φ) = (0 , 0) for all
µ ∈ P(G) where P(G) = ∩ψ∈G P(ψ) .

We denote by GI the set of all the elements of G0 that are P(G)-irrotational i.e.,

GI :=(cid:8)φ ∈ G0 ; ∃ a lift ˜φ s.t. ρµ( ˜φ) = (0 , 0) for all µ ∈ P(G)(cid:9).

Of course we are following our convention that ˜φ is a lift of φ ∈ Homeo(T2) to the

universal covering.

Moreover, it follows from Remarks 2.2 and 2.3 that GI is a normal subgroup of G if

P(G) is non-empty.

Let us remark that given ψ ∈ Homeo(T2) , its class in the mapping class group of
the torus can be identiﬁed with a matrix [ψ] in GL(2 , Z). In Lemma 3.3 we prove that
for a given ψ ∈ Homeo(T2) we have : L(ψ) 6= 0 if and only if 1 6∈ spec[ψ] , where
L(ψ) denotes the Lefschetz number of ψ. This last condition on ψ induces some rigidity
phenomena for ψ since in such a case a lift ˜ψ only commutes with the identity map
among the covering transformations (cf. Remark 2.2).

In order to show Theorem 1.1 it sufﬁces to ﬁnd a ﬁnite index normal subgroup of G that
has a global ﬁxed point. Following Proposition 3.6, an ingredient of the proof is that GI
is a ﬁnite index normal subgroup of G0 under the hypotheses in Theorem 1.1. Then we
use a convenient lift of some ψ ∈ G with L(ψ) 6= 0 and the description of the nilpotent
subgroups of GL(2 , Z) given by Lemma 3.1 to ﬁnd a lift of a ﬁnite index subgroup of G
that has an element with non-empty compact ﬁxed point set. Such a group has a global
ﬁxed point by Theorem 2.4.

2. PRELIMINARIES

Let G be a group and H be a subgroup of G. We denote by [ H, G ] the subgroup of
G generated by the elements of the form [ h , g ] = hgh−1g−1 where h ∈ H and g ∈ G.
If H is a normal subgroup of G then [ H, G ] is a subgroup of H which is normal in G.

Given a group G let us consider the upper central series {Z (n)(G)}n≥0 of G

Z (n+1)(G) :=(cid:8)g ∈ G ; [ g , f ] ∈ Z (n)(G) for all f ∈ G(cid:9)

where Z (0)(G) is the trivial subgroup of G. The members of the upper central series are
characteristic subgroups of G. In particular they are normal subgroups of G and we have

Z (0)(G) ⊂ Z (1)(G) ⊂ · · · ⊂ Z (n)(G) ⊂ · · · ⊂ G.

If Z (n)(G) = G for some n ∈ Z≥0 we say that G is a nilpotent group. The smallest
n ∈ Z≥0 such that Z (n)(G) = G is the nilpotency class of G.

The focus of this paper is the study of nilpotent groups of homeomorphisms and diffeo-

morphisms of the 2-torus.

S. FIRMO AND J. RIB ´ON

Let G be a subgroup of Homeo(T2). We say that a subgroup ˜G of Homeo(R2) is
a lift of G if any element ˜φ of ˜G is a lift of some element φ of G and the natural

projection κ : ˜G → G deﬁned by κ(cid:0) ˜φ(cid:1) = φ is an isomorphism of groups.

Let us remark that the deﬁnition of lift for groups is more restrictive than the deﬁnition
for single homeomorphisms. The translation T(0,1) is a lift of the identity map of T2 but
the group hT(0,1)i is not a lift of the group {Id}.

Deﬁnition 2.1. Let [ ] : Homeo(T2) → MCG(T2) = GL(2 , Z) be the map associating to
an element of Homeo(T2) its image in the mapping class group. Given a subgroup G of
Homeo(T2) we denote by [G] the image of G by [ ].

In what follows we will be using frequently the next two remarks.

Remark 2.2. Let φ ∈ Homeo0(T2) , µ ∈ P(φ) and ψ ∈ Homeo(T2) . For all lifts to the
universal convering ˜φ and ˜ψ of φ and ψ respectively, we have :

˜ψ ◦ Tv = T[ψ](v) ◦ ˜ψ and [ψ](cid:16)ρµ(cid:0) ˜φ(cid:1)(cid:17) = ρν(cid:0) ˜ψ ◦ ˜φ ◦ ˜ψ−1(cid:1)

where v ∈ Z2 and ν = ψ∗(µ) .

Remark 2.3. Consider the subgroup Homeo0,µ(T2) of Homeo0(T2) whose elements pre-

composed by all the lifts of elements of Homeo0,µ(T2). A change of variable argument

serve a probability measure µ and let eHomeo0,µ(R2) be the subgroup of Homeo0(R2)
prove that the map ρµ : eHomeo0,µ(R2) → R2 is a morphism of groups.

Now we introduce a result proved by the second author in [15] that will be used to ﬁnd

global ﬁxed points of nilpotent groups of diffeomorphisms of the torus.
Theorem 2.4. Let G ⊂ Diﬀ1
empty compact set for some φ ∈ G. Then G has a global ﬁxed point.

In the above theorem, Diﬀ 1

+(R2) denotes the set of C 1 orientation preserving diffeo-

morphisms of the 2-torus.

3. ROTATIONAL PROPERTIES

Let G ⊂ Homeo(T2) be a subgroup. In the introduction we say when an element φ ∈
G0 is P(G)-irrotational and we denote GI the subgroup of G formed by the elements
of G0 that are P(G)-irrotational.

Now we introduce some new notations. Suppose given µ ∈ P(G). Following the

convention about ˜φ and φ , ﬁxed in the Introduction, we deﬁne the following sets :

Gµ
˜Gµ

I :=(cid:8)φ ∈ G0 ; ∃ a lift ˜φ s.t. ρµ(cid:0) ˜φ(cid:1) = (0 , 0)(cid:9) ;
I :=(cid:8) ˜φ ∈ Homeo0(R2) ; φ ∈ G0 and ρµ(cid:0) ˜φ(cid:1) = (0 , 0)(cid:9) ;
˜GI :=(cid:8) ˜φ ∈ Homeo0(R2) ; φ ∈ G0 and ρν(cid:0) ˜φ(cid:1) = (0 , 0) for all ν ∈ P(G)(cid:9) ;

Since ρµ : eHomeo0,µ(R2) → R2 is a morphism of groups, ˜Gµ

G is an amenable group. In particular P(G) is non-empty if G is a nilpotent group.

In the remainder of this section we will see that the P(G)-irrotational subgroup GI of
a nilpotent group G ⊂ Homeo(T2) is well-behaved with respect to lifts. In particular,
if G has an element with Lefschetz number different from zero, we can even show the
existence of a ﬁnite G-orbit (cf. Theorem 3.9).

Nilpotent subgroups of Homeo(T2) induce nilpotent subgroups of the mapping class
group of T2, i.e. nilpotent subgroups of GL(2 , Z). We will need a classiﬁcation of such
groups in order to study rotational properties. They are virtually cyclic and metabelian.
Moreover, there exists a unique example of non-abelian group, up to conjugacy.

Lemma 3.1. Let G be a nilpotent subgroup of MCG(T2) . Then G is either of the form
hNi or hN , −Ni for some N ∈ G , or it is conjugated by a matrix in GL(2 , Q) to the
group

The group H is isomorphic to the dihedral group D4. We are admitting orientation-
reversing classes in the mapping class group. Notice that if all classes are orientation-
preserving then G is abelian. We include a proof of the above lemma for the sake of
clarity.

Proof. Let G be a nilpotent subgroup of GL(2 , Z). Consider the natural mapping τ :
GL(2 , C) → PGL(2 , C). We denote G+ = τ (G ∩ SL(2 , Z)) and G = τ (G). It sufﬁces
to show that either G is cyclic or G is conjugated to H.

If G+ is trivial then G is a group of cardinality at most 2. We suppose from now on

that G+ is non-trivial.

The group G+ is a Fuchsian group. Since its center is non-trivial all elements share the
same ﬁxed point set. Hence G+ is a cyclic group hαi (cf. [13, Theorems 2.3.2 and 2.3.5]
for further details).

Since G is nilpotent, its subset Tor(G) of ﬁnite order elements is a normal subgroup
of G [12, Theorem 16.2.7]. Suppose that Tor(G) is non-trivial. We claim that G is
ﬁnite. Since every non-trivial normal subgroup of a nilpotent group H contains a non
trivial element of the center of H, the group Tor(G) ∩ Z(G) is non-trivial [12, Theorem
16.2.3].
In the remaining
case there exists a non-trivial element β ∈ Tor(G) ∩ Z(G) that necessarily belongs to

If Tor(G) ∩ G+ 6= {Id} then G+ is ﬁnite and so is G.

G \ G+. Consider an element B ∈ G such that τ (B) = β. The matrix B has ﬁnite
order; thus its eigenvalues are roots of the unit. The matrix B does not have a non-
real eigenvalue λ since otherwise det(B) = λλ = 1 and this contradicts τ (B) 6∈ G+.
Hence the eigenvalues of B are necessarily 1 and −1 and we can diagonalize B up to
conjugation by a matrix in GL(2 , Q). Since τ (B) ∈ Z(G) we obtain either [ C , B ] = Id

or [ C , B ] = −Id for any C ∈ G. We denote G1 = (cid:8)C ∈ G ; [ C , B ] = Id(cid:9) ; it is a

normal subgroup of G of index at most 2. The eigenvalue associated to an eigenvector
in Q2 \ {(0 , 0)} of a matrix E in GL(2 , Z) is always 1 or −1. We deduce that C is
diagonal in the base diagonalizing B with entries in {1 , −1} for any C ∈ G1. Hence the
cardinality of G1 is less or equal than 4 and G is ﬁnite.

Since G+ is normal there exists a non-trivial element γ ∈ G+ ∩ Z(G). Suppose γ is
parabolic (#(Fix(γ)) = 1). The restriction of γ to the circle R ∪ {∞} has exactly a ﬁxed
point and all the remaining orbits are inﬁnite. Let us show that γ does not commute with
any orientation-reversing homeomorphism η of the circle R ∪ {∞} by contradiction.
Indeed γ ◦ η = η ◦ γ implies γ(Fix(η)) = Fix(η). Moreover Fix(η) contains exactly
two points if η|R∪{∞} is orientation-reversing. We deduce that the two points of Fix(η)
have ﬁnite orbits for γ , obtaining a contradiction since there is just one point whose orbit
by γ is ﬁnite. Therefore the groups G+ and G coincide and then G is cyclic.

Suppose that γ is hyperbolic, it has 2 ﬁxed points in R ∪ {∞} and no other ﬁnite
orbit. We already know that Fix(γ) = Fix(η) for any η ∈ G+ \ {Id}. Given η ∈ G \ G+
the properties γ(Fix(η)) = Fix(η) and ♯(Fix(η)) = 2 imply Fix(η) ⊂ Fix(γ) and then
Fix(η) = Fix(γ). We obtain Fix(γ) = Fix(η) for any η ∈ G \ {Id}. Fix p0 ∈ Fix(γ) ,
we deﬁne ζ : G → R∗ as ζ(η) = η′(p0). The mapping is injective. Moreover since
ζ(G+) is cyclic the image ζ(G) is cyclic unless −1 ∈ Im(ζ). This is impossible since
otherwise there exists an order 2 element in G and G is ﬁnite by the argument in the
previous paragraph. This contradicts that γ is hyperbolic.

The unique remaining case corresponds to the situation where γ is of ﬁnite order. The
group G is a ﬁnite nilpotent group of Mobius transformations. If G is not cyclic then
it is a dihedral group D2m with 2m+1 elements for some m ∈ N [16, Theorem 2.6.1].
It is easy to see that the periodic elements of τ (GL(2 , Z)) have order 1 , 2 or 3. Since
D2m contains a cyclic group with 2m elements we deduce that G is the group D2. Let
A be a matrix such that τ (A) = α. Since α belongs to G+ and has order 2 , we deduce
A 6∈ {Id , −Id} , A2 ∈ {Id , −Id} and det(A) = 1. These properties imply A2 = −Id
and spec(A) = {i , −i}. The kernel of τ|G is equal to {Id , −Id} , in particular G has
8 elements. Consider a matrix B ∈ G such that τ (B) 6∈ G+. Analogously as in the
third paragraph the matrix B satisﬁes spec(B) = {1 , −1} and it is diagonalizable by
a change of coordinates in GL(2 , Q). Moreover A does not commute with B since
otherwise spec(A) ⊂ R. Since [ A , B ] = −Id we obtain :

A =(cid:18) 0

−a−1 0 (cid:19) and B =(cid:18) 1

0 −1 (cid:19) for some a ∈ Q.

a

0

Up to a further change of coordinates we can suppose that a = 1. This implies G = H.
Since A has order 4, B has order 2 and BAB−1 = A−1, the group H is isomorphic to
D4.

Our goal in the remaining of this section is relating the rotational properties of a nilpo-

tent group with the existence of lifts.

subgroup of all lifts of elements of G.

Lemma 3.2. Let G be a subgroup of Homeo(T2) and let bG ⊂ Homeo(R2) be the
normal subgroups of bG and G respectively.
I and ˜ψ ∈ bG. By deﬁnition and convention we conclude that φ ∈ G0 ,
ρµ(cid:0) ˜φ(cid:1) = ( 0 , 0 ) and ψ ∈ G. Then ˜ψ ◦ ˜φ ◦ ˜ψ−1 is a lift of ψ ◦ φ ◦ ψ−1 ∈ G0 . Since

µ ∈ P(G) it follows from Remark 2.2 that

If µ ∈ P(G) then ˜Gµ

I , ˜GI and Gµ

I , GI are

Proof. Let ˜φ ∈ ˜Gµ

ρµ(cid:0) ˜ψ ◦ ˜φ ◦ ˜ψ−1(cid:1) = [ψ](cid:0)ρµ( ˜φ)(cid:1) = (0 , 0).

Consequently we have that ˜ψ ◦ ˜φ ◦ ˜ψ−1 ∈ ˜Gµ

I and ψ ◦ φ ◦ ψ−1 ∈ Gµ

I . As a consequence of

relation (3.0.1) the groups ˜GI and GI are normal subgroups of bG and G respectively. (cid:3)

The next elementary lemma relates the topological property L(ψ) 6= 0 with some

dynamical condition which is easier to use in our context.

Lemma 3.3. The Lefschetz number of ψ ∈ Homeo(T2) is different from zero if and only
if 1 /∈ spec[ψ] .

Proof. Given ψ ∈ Homeo(T2) we have : L(ψ) = 2 − tr([ψ]) if ψ preserves orientation
and L(ψ) = −tr([ψ]) when ψ is orientation reversing.

Suppose ψ is orientation-preserving. Since det[ψ] = 1 we have

1 ∈ spec[ψ] ⇔ spec[ψ] = {1} ⇔ tr([ψ]) = 2 ⇔ L(ψ) = 0.

Suppose ψ is orientation-reversing. Since det[ψ] = −1 we have

1 ∈ spec[ψ] ⇔ spec[ψ] = {1, −1} ⇔ tr([ψ]) = 0 ⇔ L(ψ) = 0.

In any case L(ψ) 6= 0 if and only if 1 /∈ spec[ψ] .

(cid:3)

The existence of lifts for normal subgroups can be interpreted in terms of G-invariant

measures when L(ψ) 6= 0 for some ψ ∈ G.

Proposition 3.4. Let G be a nilpotent subgroup of Homeo(T2) and let ψ ∈ G such that
L(ψ) 6= 0 . Fix a lift ˜ψ of ψ and µ ∈ P(G). Consider a normal subgroup H of G with
H ⊂ G0 . Then H has a lift ˜H such that ˜ψ ˜H ˜ψ−1 = ˜H if and only if H ⊂ Gµ
I . In such
a case we have ˜H ⊂ ˜Gµ
I .

Since H consists of isotopic to the identity homeomorphisms, for a ﬁxed ψ ∈ G we
have that ˜ψ ◦ ˜φ ◦ ˜ψ−1 does not depend on the choise of the lift ˜ψ of ψ when φ ∈ H.
Consequently, the condition ˜ψ ˜H ˜ψ−1 = ˜H does not depend on the choice of the lift ˜ψ of
ψ.
Proof. First, if H ⊂ Gµ
κ : ˜Gµ
Lemma 3.2 we know that the lift ˜ψ ◦ ˜h ◦ ˜ψ−1 of ψ ◦ h ◦ ψ−1 is in ˜Gµ

I then ˜H = κ−1(H) is a lift of H since the natural projection
I is an isomorphism. Consider any ˜h ∈ ˜H. We denote h = κ(˜h). From
I and we have

I → Gµ

8

S. FIRMO AND J. RIB ´ON

κ( ˜ψ ◦ ˜h ◦ ˜ψ−1) = ψ ◦ h ◦ ψ−1. Since H is normal in G we have ψ ◦ h ◦ ψ−1 ∈ H and
then ˜ψ ◦ ˜h ◦ ˜ψ−1 ∈ ˜H by deﬁnition of ˜H. Consequently, ˜ψ ˜H ˜ψ−1 = ˜H .

j ≥ 0 .

Now let us suppose that H ⊂ G0 admits a lift ˜H such that ˜ψ ˜H ˜ψ−1 = ˜H . We want
to prove that ρµ(˜h) = (0 , 0) for any ˜h ∈ ˜H. For this it sufﬁces to show by induction on

j that ρµ(cid:0)˜h(cid:1) = (0 , 0) for any ˜h ∈ ˜H such that h ∈ H j where H j = Z (j)(G) ∩ H and

The result is obvious for j = 0. Suppose it holds true for some j ≥ 0 and consider
˜h ∈ ˜H with h ∈ H j+1. In that case the map ψ ◦ h ◦ ψ−1 ◦ h−1 belongs to H j for any
ψ ∈ G. Moreover we have that ˜ψ ◦ ˜h ◦ ˜ψ−1 ◦ ˜h−1 is contained in ˜H by hypothesis and
we obtain :

(0 , 0) = ρµ(cid:0) ˜ψ ◦ ˜h ◦ ˜ψ−1 ◦ ˜h−1(cid:1) = ρµ(cid:0) ˜ψ ◦ ˜h ◦ ˜ψ−1(cid:1) + ρµ(cid:0)˜h−1(cid:1)

= [ψ](cid:0)ρµ(cid:0)˜h(cid:1)(cid:1) − ρµ(cid:0)˜h(cid:1) =(cid:0)[ψ] − Id(cid:1)(cid:0)ρµ(cid:0)˜h(cid:1)(cid:1).
we deduce ρµ(cid:0)˜h(cid:1) = (0 , 0) for any h ∈ H j+1. We obtain ˜H ⊂ ˜Gµ

The ﬁrst equality is given by the induction hypothesis. The others are given by Remarks
2.3 and 2.2. Since L(f ) 6= 0 we have from Lemma 3.3 that 1 6∈ spec[ψ] . Consequently,
(cid:3)

I .

Remark 3.5. Proposition 3.4 admits an analogue for the case of a surface S of genus
g ≥ 2. Let G be a nilpotent subgroup of Homeo(S). Any element φ ∈ G induces an
element in Sp(2g, Z) that represents its action on the ﬁrst homology group. The group
G0 admits a canonical lift, the so called identity lift. The existence of such lift implies
that all the homological rotation vectors of elements of G0 with respect to measures in
P(G) are equal to 0 if ∩φ∈GKer([φ] − Id) = {0}. The proof is analogous to the proof of
Proposition 3.4.

The existence of a lift for a subgroup does not depend on the speciﬁc choice of an

invariant measure. This property is made explicit in the next proposition.

Proposition 3.6. Let G be a nilpotent subgroup of Homeo(T2). Suppose there exists
ψ ∈ G with L(ψ) 6= 0 . Then we obtain ˜GI = ˜Gµ
I for any µ ∈ P(G).
Moreover GI is a ﬁnite index normal subgroup of G0 .

I and GI = Gµ

Let us remind that GI is a normal subgroup of G. This has been proved on Lemma

3.2.

Proof. Let µ , ν ∈ P(G) and let ψ ∈ G with L(ψ) 6= 0 . From Lemma 3.2 we have
˜ψ ˜Gν
I ⊂ G0 is a normal subgroup of G. Then we

Let us consider h ∈ H j+1. We know that ψ ◦ h ◦ ψ−1 ◦ h−1 is contained in H j. Now
ﬁx lifts ˜ψ and ˜h of ψ and h respectively. Then we have kρµ( ˜ψ ◦ ˜h ◦ ˜ψ−1 ◦ ˜h−1) ∈ Z2.
Moreover, it follows from Remarks 2.3 and 2.2 that :

kρµ( ˜ψ ◦ ˜h ◦ ˜ψ−1 ◦ ˜h−1) = k(cid:0)ρµ(cid:0) ˜ψ ◦ ˜h ◦ ˜ψ−1(cid:1) − ρµ(cid:0)˜h(cid:1)(cid:1) = k(cid:0)[ψ] − Id(cid:1)(cid:0)ρµ(cid:0)˜h(cid:1)(cid:1) ∈ Z2.
the entries of the matrix k′(cid:0)[ψ] − Id(cid:1)−1 are integer numbers where k′ = det([ψ] − Id).

Since L(ψ) 6= 0 it follows from Lemma 3.3 that 1 6∈ spec[ψ] . Then, we have that all

Consequently we conclude that

We consider the subgroups H and G of diffeomorphisms of T2 whose lifts belong to

µ.

In the rest of this article Fix(f ) denotes the set of ﬁxed points of the map f. If L is a

family of maps we note Fix(L) := ∩f ∈LFix(f ).

The next theorem implies Theorem 1.1. In its proof we use the following remarks.

Remark 3.7. Let ˜ψ ∈ Homeo(R2) be a lift of ψ ∈ Homeo(T2) such that 1 /∈ spec[ψ] .
Then we have for each q ∈ T2 :

• either π−1(q) ∩ Fix(cid:0) ˜ψ(cid:1) = ∅ or it is a single point by Remark 2.2 ,
• if q ∈ Fix(ψ) and ˜q ∈ π−1(q) is not in Fix(cid:0) ˜ψ(cid:1) then ˜ψ(˜q) = ˜q + (m , n) where

(m , n) ∈ Z2 \ {(0 , 0)} ; in particular, ˜ψ(˜q) is far from ˜q.

Let us ﬁx D ⊂ R2 as the closure of a fundamental domain for the covering map π : R2 →
T2 and let us consider the following set

Γ :=(cid:8) ˜p ∈ D ; π−1(cid:0)π(˜p)(cid:1) ∩ Fix(cid:0) ˜ψ(cid:1) 6= ∅(cid:9).

Given ˜p ∈ Γ we have that ˜p + (m , n) ∈ Fix(cid:0) ˜ψ(cid:1) for some (m , n) ∈ Z2. If ˜q ∈ Γ is
sufﬁciently close to ˜p then ˜q + (m , n) ∈ Fix(cid:0) ˜ψ(cid:1) , otherwise ˜ψ(cid:0)˜q + (m , n)(cid:1) is far from
˜ψ(cid:0)˜p + (m , n)(cid:1) contradicting that ˜ψ(cid:0)˜p + (m , n)(cid:1) = ˜p + (m , n) . Similar arguments prove

that Γ is compact. It sufﬁces to remark that if (˜pn)n≥1 is a sequence in Γ and ˜pn → ˜q

10

then π(˜q) ∈ Fix(ψ). From the compactness of Γ we conclude that Fix(cid:0) ˜ψ(cid:1) is bounded.

Consequently it is a compact subset of R2 that may be eventually empty.

Remark 3.8. Let G be a nilpotent subgroup of GL(2 , Z) such that there exists A ∈ G
with 1 6∈ spec(A). Let us see that we can always choose A so that it preserves orientation.
We have that the group G has the form : {N n}n∈Z , {±N n}n∈Z for some N ∈
GL(2 , Z) or it is conjugated to H by Lemma 3.1. In the ﬁrst case we have 1 6∈ spec(N).
Moreover, simple algebraic manipulations prove that 1 6∈ spec(N 2) when N is orientation-
reversing ; thus we can choose A = N if N is orientation-preserving and A = N 2
if N is orientation-reversing. Analogously in the case G = {±N n}n∈Z we choose an
orientation-preserving A ∈ G such that A ∈ {N 2, −N 2} and 1 6∈ spec(A). In the last
case when G is conjugated to H , we choose A = −Id.

Theorem 3.9. Let G be a nilpotent subgroup of Diﬀ 1(T2) . Suppose there exists ψ ∈ G
such that L(ψ) 6= 0 . Then Fix(GI) 6= ∅ and G has a ﬁnite orbit contained in Fix(GI).

Proof. Following Remark 3.8 and Lemma 3.3 we assume without loss of generality that
ψ is orientation-preserving.

Since L(ψ) 6= 0 , let us choose a lift ˜ψ ∈ Diﬀ 1

+(R2) of ψ such that Fix( ˜ψ) 6= ∅ . From

Remark 3.7 we conclude that Fix( ˜ψ) is a non-empty compact subset of R2.

Now, we denote J = hGI , ψi and ˜J = h ˜GI , ˜ψi ⊂ Diﬀ1

+(R2). We will prove that J
is a ﬁnite index subgroup of G. To do this it sufﬁces to do it for hG0 , ψi since GI is a
ﬁnite index subgroup of G0 by Proposition 3.6 and G0 is a normal subgroup of G.

To prove that hG0 , ψi is a ﬁnite index subgroup of G we go back to Lemma 3.1 to

remind that the group [G] has the form :

hNi

or

hN , −Ni

for some N ∈ GL(2 , Z) ,

or

it is a ﬁnite group .

Moreover we know that f, g ∈ G deﬁne the same element in G/G0 if and only if they
are isotopic. Consequently if [G] is a ﬁnite group then G0 has ﬁnite index in G and of
course the same is true for hG0 , ψi.

that hG0 , ψi has ﬁnite index in G.

On the other hand f, g ∈ G deﬁne the same class in G/hG0 , ψi if and only if g−1 ◦ f
is isotopic to ψm for some m ∈ Z . Now, simple algebraic manipulations on the two ﬁrst

forms of [G] assuming [ψ] ∈(cid:8)N , N 2 , −N 2(cid:9) give us that #(cid:0)G/hG0 , ψi(cid:1) ≤ 4 proving
The group ˜GI is normal in h ˜GI, ˜ψi since it is normal in bG as proved in Lemma 3.2.
+(R2). Moreover, we know that Fix(cid:0) ˜ψ(cid:1) is a non-empty
compact set. Thus Theorem 2.4 in [15] guarantee that Fix(cid:0) ˜J(cid:1) 6= ∅ and we conclude that

Then the derived group h ˜GI, ˜ψi′ of h ˜GI, ˜ψi is contained in ˜GI and hence the natural
projection given by κ : h ˜GI, ˜ψi′ → hGI, ψi′
is an isomorphism. We deduce that ˜J
is a nilpotent subgroup of Diﬀ1

hGI , ψi has a global ﬁxed point.

On the other hand the group hGI , ψi is a ﬁnite index subgroup of G. Let g1 , . . . , gk ∈

(cid:3)

4. REPLACING T2 WITH THE COMPACT ANNULUS, THE KLEIN BOTTLE OR THE

M ¨OBIUS STRIP

In this last section we remark that Theorem 1.1 is also true for the circle S1, the compact

annulus S1 × [0 , 1] , the Klein bottle and the compact M¨obius strip.

For this, let us remind that a homeomorphism f ∈ Homeo(S1) has a non-zero Lefschetz

number if and only if it is orientation-reversing.

Proposition 4.1. Theorem 1.1 stays true for nilpotent groups of homeomorphisms when
we replace T2 with S1.

Proof. Let ψ be an orientation-reversing homeomorphism of a subgroup G of Homeo(S1).
The ﬁxed point set of Fix(ψ) contains exactly two points. Analogously to Lemma 3.2 the
group GI of elements with 0 ∈ R/Z rotation number is a ﬁnite index normal subgroup of
the group G0 of orientation-preserving elements of G. We claim Fix(hGI, ψi) = Fix(ψ).
We deﬁne H j = Z (j)(G) ∩ GI. It sufﬁces to prove that Fix(ψ) ⊂ Fix(φ) for all φ ∈ H j
and 0 ≤ j. Let us prove the result by induction on j. It is clear for j = 0. Suppose the
result holds for j and consider any φ ∈ H j+1. The element η := φ◦ψ◦φ−1 ◦ψ−1 belongs
to Z (j)(G) and has rotation number 2ρ(φ). Since φ ∈ GI , we obtain ρ(η) = 0. In par-
ticular η belongs to H j. Since φ ◦ ψ ◦ φ−1 = η ◦ ψ , we deduce φ(Fix(ψ)) = Fix(η ◦ ψ).
The induction hypothesis implies Fix(ψ) ⊂ Fix(η ◦ ψ). Since both ψ and η ◦ ψ are
orientation-reversing both their ﬁxed point sets contain exactly two point. As a conse-
quence we obtain Fix(η ◦ψ) = Fix(ψ) and then φ(Fix(ψ)) = Fix(ψ) for any φ ∈ H j+1.
The rotation number of φ is 0 and thus any periodic orbit of φ is a ﬁxed point. Hence
Fix(ψ) ⊂ Fix(φ) for any φ ∈ H j+1.

The group hGI, ψi is a ﬁnite index subgroup of G. Hence there exists a ﬁnite orbit of
(cid:3)

G whose intersection with Fix(ψ) is non-empty.

The version of Theorem 1.1 for the compact annulus is a corollary of the proof of

Theorem 3.9.

Theorem 4.2. Let N be a nilpotent subgroup of Diﬀ 1(S1 × [0 , 1]) .
element f with L(f ) 6= 0 then :

If N has some

(i) N has a ﬁnite orbit in each connected component of the annulus boundary when

f leaves invariant each one of these components ;

(ii) N has ﬁnite orbits in the interior of the annulus when f permutes the connected

components of the annulus boundary.

12

S. FIRMO AND J. RIB ´ON

Proof. Let f ∈ N with L(f ) 6= 0 . Hence f changes the orientation of the generator of
the ﬁrst singular homology group of the annulus. We have to consider two cases.
CASE (i) : f leaves invariant each one of the components of the annulus boundary.

In that case, the restrictions of f to each one of these components has non-zero Lef-

schetz number and the result follows from the previous proposition.
CASE (ii) : f changes the components of the annulus boundary.

To detect a ﬁnite orbit in the interior of the annulus we consider the double T2 of the
annulus. With this construction we obtain a nilpotent subgroup G of Homeo(T2) and a
map ψ ∈ G whose class in the mapping class group is given by the matrix

[ψ] =(cid:20) −1

0 −1 (cid:21)

n

for some n ∈ Z.

We have L(ψ) = 4.

At this point we can not apply Theorem 1.1 in a straightforward way to obtain a ﬁnite
orbit because the elements of G deﬁned in the double of the annulus are not necessarily
of class C 1 along the boundary of the annulus in T2.

Nevertheless, in this situation, we can repeat the same arguments presented in the proof
of Theorem 3.9. Let us remark that we use the C 1 differentiability in the proof of such
theorem just to guarantee a global ﬁxed point for h ˜GI , ˜ψi ⊂ Diﬀ 1
+(R2) via Theorem 2.4.
Let us ﬁx the universal covering map π : R2 → T2 such that the restrictions of π to
the strips R × [0 , 1/2] and R × [1/2 , 1] are the universal covering maps corresponding
to the two copies of the annulus in the double.

The elements of ˜GI have a trivial rotation vector with respect to the Borel probability
measures invariant by the group G. Hence, the strips R × [0 , 1/2] and R × [1/2 , 1] are
invariant by all ˜φ ∈ ˜GI.

On the other hand we know that, in the double, the map ψ has a ﬁxed point in the inte-
rior of each copy of the annulus since L(ψ) 6= 0 and ψ permutes the connected compo-
nents of the annulus. Now, consider a lift ˜ψ having a ﬁxed point in the strip R × [0 , 1/2] .
Then, from remark 3.7 we know that Fix( ˜ψ) is a non-empty compact set. Moreover we
have that the strip R × [0 , 1/2] is also invariant by ˜ψ. Consequently, we can apply The-
orem 2.4 to the nilpotent group given by the restriction of the elements of h ˜GI , ˜ψi to the
strip R × (0 , 1/2) obtaining a global ﬁxed point for the group h ˜GI , ˜ψi . Following the
end of the proof of Theorem 3.9 we conclude the existence of a ﬁnite orbit for the group
G. Consequently, the group N has a ﬁnite orbit in the interior of the annulus.
(cid:3)

In what follows let Π : T2 → K2 be the 2-fold orientation covering map of the Klein
bottle K2 by T2 and let us denote by σ the non-trivial lift of the identity map by Π. If

lifts of elements of G.

G ⊂ Homeo(K2) is a subgroup, let us denote by bG ⊂ Homeo(T2) the subgroup of all

Given an element φ ∈ G its distinct lifts to T2 by Π are ˜φ and σ ◦ ˜φ. Hence we
have that the lifts of φ ∈ G by Π commute with the covering transformations since the
lifts ˜φ ◦ σ and σ ◦ ˜φ are different from ˜φ and then equal. This property implies that if G

is a nilpotent group with nilpotent class n ∈ Z+ then bG is also a nilpotent group, with

nilpotent class at most n + 1.

NILPOTENT ACTIONS ON THE TORUS

13

Moreover, if ψ ∈ Homeo(K2) then the Lefschetz numbers of the lifts of ψ by Π are
2L(ψ) and 0. Consequently, if G has an element with non-trivial Lefschetz number then

bG has the same property and we obtain the following corollary of Theorem 1.1.

Corollary 4.3. Let G be a nilpotent subgroup of Diﬀ 1(K2) . If G has some element
whose Lefschetz number is different from zero then G has a ﬁnite orbit.

Repeating for the M¨obius strip the above arguments presented in this section for the

annulus and for the Klein bottle we conclude the following corollary of Theorem 4.2.

Corollary 4.4. Let N be a nilpotent subgroup of the group of all C 1-diffeomorphisms of
the compact M¨obius strip. If N has some element f with L(f ) 6= 0 then N has ﬁnite
orbits in the boundary and in the interior of the M¨obius strip.

The C 1 hypothesis is not necessary to ﬁnd ﬁnite orbits in the boundary of the M¨obius
strip. Such a boundary has one connected component that is homeomorphic to a circle.
Hence there exist ﬁnite orbits in the boundary by Proposition 4.1. Finally let us remind that
the non-trivial covering transformation σ associated to the 2-fold orientation covering of
the compact M¨obius strip by the compact annulus, permutes the connected components
of the boundary of the annulus. In that case, one of the lifts ˜ψ , σ ◦ ˜ψ permutes such
components. There exists an interior ﬁnite orbit by Theorem 4.2.
