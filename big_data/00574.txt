Small lattice bipolarons driven by external harmonic ﬁelds are considered in the
adiabatic approximation. Resonant excitation of ions modulates the trapping potential
and promotes hole transfer between neighboring atomic layers. It leads to a dramatic
decrease of the apparent bipolaron mass compared to the undriven case. This eﬀect
oﬀers an explanation for dynamic stabilization of superconductivity at high temperatures
recently observed in layered cuprates.

Keywords: Bipolarons; periodic driving; high-Tc superconductivity.

Introduction

Recently, Hu et al. achieved stabilization of superconducting correlations in
YBa2Cu3O6.5 at temperatures up to 300 K by exciting apical oxygen ions with exter-
nal laser ﬁelds.1,2 The observation implies a strong coupling between ion displace-
ments and superconducting carriers. c-polarized ion vibrations have been known
to result in an anisotropic polaron eﬀect with a much reduced inplane (bi)polaron
mass3 but much enhanced interplane mass.4 The results of Hu et al. can be easily
interpreted in terms of small polaron transport between copper-oxygen bilayers. As
illustrated in Fig. 1(a), in the absence of external ﬁelds, apical ions are displaced
toward one of the conducting CuO2 bilayers, thereby stabilizing a pair of holes
in a bipolaron state. Coherent tunneling between bilayers requires simultaneous
reversal of the lattice deformation. The tunneling probability ωt is exponentially
small because of small overlap of ion wave functions. In the preformed pair mecha-
nism of superconductivity,5,6,7,8,9,10 the Bose-Einstein condensation temperature
is Tc ∝ m−2/3
1/3. Due to the smallness of ωt, Tc is exponentially sup-
pressed. When the ions are driven into resonance by an external ﬁeld, see Fig. 1(b),
the trapping potential begins to oscillate symmetrically between bilayers promot-
ing bipolaron tunneling. As a result, the tunneling frequency increases from the
exponentially small ωt to the external frequency ω. It can increase Tc substan-
tially, up to several times, even after the cube root operation. This eﬀect, possi-
bly observed by Hu et al., lends support to the bipolaron mechanism of high-Tc

2. Adiabatic Potential

In this paper, driven bipolarons are investigated in the adiabatic approximation. A
simple two site model is suﬃcient to capture the main tunneling physics. Similarly,
the entire layer of apical oxygen ions is represented by a single phenomenological
spring-mass quantum mode y. The model includes the hole part Hh (comprising
free-hole hopping and inter-hole Hubbard repulsion), the free ion part Hi, hole-ion
interaction Hhi and ion-laser interaction Hil:

Here s = 1, 2 is the site (layer) index, σ = ↑,↓ is the spin index, c are the fermion
hole operators, ˆρ = c†c, J is the inter-layer single hole transfer integral, U is the
onsite Hubbard repulsion, M and Ω are mass and frequency of the vibration mode,
f is the hole-ion interaction force, zi|e| is the ion electric charge, E and ω are the
amplitude and frequency of an external electric ﬁeld. The onsite hole energy is
chosen as zero energy. Note that U should be regarded as a pseudopotential. In 3D
reality the bipolaron has a ﬁnite (ab) size rather than being conﬁned to a single site.
In the two site model, an eﬀective U represents the real Coulomb repulsion within
a bilayer.

The above model does not include direct interaction between the external
ﬁeld and holes. In general, this interaction is important and leads to dynamic
localization12 and other nontrivial eﬀects. Here, it is neglected since dynamic lo-
calization is less prominent in a two-site system than in a long chain because the
potential drop between the two sites is small. Away from special frequencies, the
change in tunneling probability is expected to be small compared to the exponential
increase caused by resonant excitation of ions. However, in a more complete theory
yet to be developed, this interaction should be included.

In the adiabatic approximation13,14 the hole subsystem of Eqs. (1)-(4) must be
solved for an arbitrary ion conﬁguration ﬁrst. For a single ion degree of freedom,
this is easily done even for two holes. Diagonalizing the (4 × 4) matrix of Hh + Hhi
for a ﬁxed y yields an equation for hole energy E[y]:

EnE (E − U )2 − 4J 2 (E − U ) − 4f 2y2Eo = 0 .

The lowest root of the cubic equation must be added to the ion elastic energy to
form full adiabatic potential W (y). For U = 0,

Wn0(y) =

1
2

M Ω2y2 − npJ 2 + f 2y2 ,

with n = 2. Wn0 is written in this form because the choice n = 1 exactly reproduces
the case of one hole. Thus the same expression can be used to study both the polaron
and bipolaron. For U > 0, hole energy E[y] has to be computed numerically from
Eq. (5).

To proceed further, the adiabatic potential and the Schr¨odinger equation is

transformed into a dimensionless form. Let y0 = p/(M Ω) be the unit of length,

Ω−1 the unit of time and (Ω) the unit of energy. Introducing dimensionless coor-
dinate ζ = y/y0, time τ = Ωt, potential w = W/(Ω) and hole transfer amplitude
j = J/(Ω), one obtains

Note the formation of a local minimum at ζ = 0.

It is useful now to summarize physical properties of the adiabatic potential,

Eq. (8), as it deﬁnes tunneling physics in the undriven case, αi = 0.

4 , i.e. at a smaller λ than the polaron
2 ). This is the essence of the bipolaron eﬀect: two holes deform the

.

(ii) For arbitrary U , an analytical solution of the cubic equation (5) results
in expressions that are too cumbersome, so it is easier to proceed numerically.
Bipolaron adiabatic potential is shown in ﬁgure 2 for several values of λ and U .
Examination of the curves reveals an interesting feature. At small U , the double
minimum develops at ζ = 0. However, at larger U , the new minima appear at
ζ 6= 0. Thus, the ground state jumps from the symmetrical point ζ = 0 directly to
a nonzero value ζ0. (In that sense, it is analogous to a ﬁrst-order phase transition.)
The zero and non-zero minima are separated by an energy barrier, see the right
panel in ﬁgure 2. Figure 3 shows the coupling constant and displacement of the
bipolaron potential vs. repulsion U , respectively. When the ion is localized in the
ζ = 0 minimum, the two polarons are on the opposite sides of the ion. Thus, a large
Hubbard repulsion prevents bipolaron formation and stabilizes the lattice against
deformation.

order phase transition. The critical value Ucr at which second-order formation becomes ﬁrst-order
formation increases approximately linearly with j.

Frequency reduction near the transition is another common feature of bipolaron
systems.

The energy distance between pairs is of order (Ω) while the energy split within
each pair is exponentially small reﬂecting the small tunneling amplitude between
the wells. The ground state split can be computed analytically using the instanton
technique14,15,16 with the following result, see Appendix A

F2(x) = x2p1 − x−2 − loghx(cid:16)1 +p1 − x−2(cid:17)i .

Since F2(x ≫ 1) → x2, the energy split at large λ is △ǫ12 ∝ exp (−2n2jλ) with
exponential accuracy. Thus, the bipolaron mass scales as the fourth power of the
polaron mass.17 For U > 0, the energy split can be computed numerically. With
dimensionless units adopted here, the tunneling frequency between the wells is equal
to the energy split: ωt = △ǫ12.

3. Driven Bipolaron

The full time-dependent problem, Eq. (7), is now considered. The equation has been
solved directly in time domain by the implicit time-stepping diﬀerencing scheme
developed in Ref. 18. The numerical method is unitary and accurate to (△τ )2. The
method accurately reproduces the solution for a driven harmonic oscillator, which
is known analytically.19 The initial condition is a wave function localized in one of

0.36 − 0.39. Driving frequencies are given in units of Ω.

oscillation period between the wells is T0 = 2π/△ǫ12 = 5710. Undriven tunneling
between the wells is shown by the thick dashed line. Under an external ﬁeld, the
bipolaron begins to oscillate between the wells as shown by the thin solid line.
Fourier analysis of the time series, see Fig. 5 (top left), reveals a series of sharp
peaks indicating coherent nature of the tunneling. The ﬁrst large peak occurs at
f ≈ 0.0046, which corresponds to an oscillation period of T = 217. (Given a driving
frequency of ω = 0.63, the tunneling period is equal to about 22 driving periods.)
Thus, tunneling period has been reduced by 5710/217 = 26 times relative to the
undriven case.

Figure 5 shows Fourier analysis of tunneling probabilities for several λ and ω.
All cases display sharp peaks in approximately the same part of the spectrum.
It indicates rough similarity in tunneling characteristics: coherent tunneling with
oscillation periods between 200 and 300. This is because in all cases the external
forces have close amplitudes and frequencies. The external force drives the ion into a
resonance near the bottom of the well, and after about 10-12 local oscillations the ion
is thrown into the other well. Since the potential is nonlinear near ζ = 0, see Fig. 2,
the resonant frequency changes with amplitude. Temporal dynamics becomes highly
nonlinear, which generates multiple peaks in Fourier spectra. The independence of
driven probabilities of the potential details is in sharp contrast with the undriven
case when T0 scales exponentially with λ. For example, at λ = 0.39, the energy split
is already △ǫ12 = 7.944 · 10−5 [formula (13) is accurate to 3.7%] and T0 = 79064.
The driven case still has T = 248, a reduction of T0/T = 320 times. From that
standpoint, external driving causes exponential increase of tunneling probability.

the undriven case, αi = 0. The solid line is the driven case with αi = 0.1 and ω/Ω = 0.75.

A nonzero Hubbard potential U disfavors colocation of two holes in the same
layer. As a result, larger λ are needed to form the bipolaron. As can be observed in
Fig. 2, when eventually formed the double-well potential is wider than at U = 0 and
tunneling is further impeded. The bipolaron transition is very sharp. For example,
for U = 40, the lowest doublet energy split drops from ≈ 10−3 to ≈ 10−6 when λ
increases from 1.1032 to 1.1033, i.e. by just 0.0001. To have a reasonable tunneling
without external driving λ must be ﬁnely tuned. In contrast, under driving the
tunneling probability depends on the properties of the external ﬁeld and is largely
insensitive to the ﬁne details of the bipolaron potential. As an example, driven and
undriven bipolarons are compared for U = 40 and λ = 1.10324 in Fig. 6. The
oscillation period in the undriven case is ≈ 1.2 · 106 while in the driven case it is
≈ 455, a reduction by 2700 times.
Relevance of the obtained results to the experiments of Hu et al.1 is now dis-
cussed. Direct impact of forced oscillations on superconducting correlations is a
clear evidence of strong interaction between apical oxygens and the superconducting
phase in YBa2Cu3O6.5. Moreover, the picture is consistent with the small polaron
nature of inter-layer transport. In the absence of external forces, displaced ions
trap the holes within the conducting copper-oxygen bilayers. Inter-bilayer hopping
is exponentially slow because it requires simultaneous reversal of ion displacement.
The process is not completely suppressed, however. The “residual” hopping is still
suﬃcient to provide a macroscopic 3D coherence of the superconducting phase. The
critical temperature is reduced by the factor m−1/3
but nonetheless is nonzero.
An external laser ﬁeld drives the apical oxygens into resonance thus liberating the

trapped holes. Essentially, the hole’s c eﬀective mass is replaced with the external
laser frequency and inter-bilayer hopping increases exponentially. As a result, su-
perconducting weight is transferred from the intra-bilayer mode to the inter-bilayer
mode, as reported in Ref. 1. As shown in the present work, the tunneling proba-
bility can be increased by a factor of 102 − 103, which is suﬃcient to explain the
6-fold increase of the critical temperature when the cube root function is applied.
Inclusion of inter-hole repulsion, represented by the Hubbard pseudopotential U ,
does not qualitatively change this picture. Rather, it shifts threshold λ to larger
values and sharpens the transition.

The results reported here demonstrate extreme sensitivity of the superconduct-
ing properties to model parameters: bare hopping J, ion frequency ω, hole repulsion
U and especially hole-ion interaction force f . For the superconductivity mechanism
to work, the entire system must be very ﬁne tuned. Small variations in f , for exam-
ple, will cause exponential changes in inter-bilayer hopping probability and critical
temperature. This feature may be the key to understanding why high-Tc supercon-
ductivity in complex oxides is conﬁned to a handful of compositions and is not more
widespread. It can also help explain experimentally observed changes of supercon-
ductivity with chemical doping and physical pressure.

4. Summary

In summary, driven lattice bipolarons have been analyzed in the adiabatic approx-
imation. It is shown that the bipolaron tunneling probability can be drastically
increased by a periodic external force acting on the constituent ions. The ions are
driven into resonance near the bottom of potential wells. The resonant conditions
help accumulate energy to go over the barrier in 10 to 20 oscillations. Then the
carriers follow by means of much faster bare tunneling. This results in a signiﬁcant
reduction of the bipolaron mass and a many-fold increase in their Bose-condensation
temperature. This mechanism oﬀers a simple explanation of dynamic stabilization
of superconductivity observed in YBa2Cu3O6.5. General nature of the eﬀect sug-
gests that similar enhancements may be observed in other layered superconductors.
Extensions of the present work beyond the adiabatic two-site case seem warranted.
