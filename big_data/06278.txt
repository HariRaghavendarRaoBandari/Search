We report microwave-driven photon-assisted tunneling in a suspended carbon nanotube double
quantum dot. From the resonant linewidth at a temperature of 13 mK, the charge dephasing time is
determined to be 280± 30 ps. The linewidth is independent of driving frequency, but increases with
increasing temperature. The moderate temperature dependence is inconsistent with expectations
from electron-phonon coupling alone, but consistent with charge noise arising in the device. The
extracted level of charge noise is comparable with that expected from previous measurements of a
valley-spin qubit, where it was hypothesized to be the main cause of qubit decoherence. Our results
suggest a possible route towards improved valley-spin qubits.

Qubit manipulation in carbon nanotube devices is of
interest both for quantum computing [1–4] and for co-
herent control of nanomechanical states via strong cou-
pling to a spin qubit [5, 6]. The low concentration of
nuclear spins in carbon is at ﬁrst sight promising for spin
and valley coherence, but the qubit coherence time ob-
served so far [7, 8] has not exceeded 100 ns, well be-
low the expected limit from electron-lattice and spin-
orbit coupling [9, 10].
Instead, it is possible that this
coherence is limited by charge dephasing, with a cou-
pling to valley-spin states arising from spin-orbit coupling
or gate-voltage dependent inter-dot exchange [11, 12].
Here, we probe charge dephasing by measuring photon-
assisted tunneling (PAT) [13] for the ﬁrst time in a car-
bon nanotube double quantum dot. By measuring the
frequency and temperature dependence of the PAT res-
onance linewidth, we deduce that in this device, low-
temperature charge dephasing is limited mainly by elec-
trical noise, with possible contribution from phonon cou-
pling above 50 mK, and with electron tunneling excluded
as the dominant mechanism. The noise level deduced
from the dephasing rate is of the same order of magni-
tude as estimated previously to account for dephasing of
the nanotube valley-spin qubit [7].

To fabricate the double quantum dot [Fig. 1(a)], a car-
bon nanotube is synthesized by chemical vapour deposi-
tion on a quartz chip using FeCl as a catalyst [14]. On
a separate chip, consisting of intrinsic Si substrate with
300 nm thermal oxide, 20 nm thick Cr/Au gates (labelled
1-5) are patterned, followed by 130 nm thick Cr/Au con-
tact electrodes to deﬁne a trench. The nanotube is trans-
ferred by stamping [4, 15] so that it is suspended over
the trench between the two contacts. The device is mea-
sured in a dilution refrigerator with a base temperature
of 13 mK. To ensure electron thermalization, all dc wires
are heat-sunk via printed circuit board copper powder
ﬁlters containing RC stages with ∼ 100 kHz cutoﬀ [16].
Gate 1 is connected to a microwave source via a section
of NbTi superconducting coaxial cable and ﬁxed cold at-

the combination of Schottky barriers near the contacts and

tial is formed. A source-drain bias VSD applied to the contact
electrodes leads to a measured current I. Photon-assisted
tunneling can be driven by applying a microwave voltage to
gate 1. For the image, ∼ 2 nm Pt was evaporated to improve

A double quantum dot potential is created through a
combination of Schottky barriers at the contacts and dc
gate voltages. Gate voltages are set so that the dou-
ble dot is measured in the pp conﬁguration, where both
quantum dots are occupied by holes. With a DC bias
VSD applied between the contacts and the microwaves
turned oﬀ, the current through the nanotube is shown
in Fig. 1(b). As a function of gate voltages V1 and V4
applied to gates 1 and 4 respectively, a pair of triangles
of allowed current indicate Coulomb-blockaded transport
through a double quantum dot [17].

To detect PAT, the current is measured with mi-
crowaves applied [Fig. 2(a)]. A line of microwave-induced

a function of microwave frequency f allows spectroscopy
of the double quantum dot. With the detuning ε de-
ﬁned as the diﬀerence in hole chemical potentials between
right and left dots, a current peak is expected whenever
nhf = ∆E(ε), where ∆E(ε) is the energy diﬀerence be-
tween bonding and antibonding states of the double dot,
n is an integer, and h is Planck’s constant.

This PAT spectroscopy is seen in Fig. 2(b), which
shows n = 1 peaks for two diﬀerent microwave frequen-
cies. The current is plotted against gate voltage location
∆V4, deﬁned along the line marked in Fig. 2(a) with the
origin set at the triangle baseline so that ε = λ∆V4,
where λ is the lever arm between gete voltage and de-
tuning. As expected, the peak moves towards greater
detuning with higher frequency. To characterize this be-
haviour in more detail, we ﬁt the current peak at each
frequency with a Lorentzian, including an oﬀset slope to
account for background current. The ﬁtted peak centers
are plotted in Fig. 2(c). The dependence of peak detun-
ing on frequency is approximately linear, consistent with
a weakly tunnel-coupled double dot. The data are ﬁtted
to the equation expected from a two-level model [18]:

current [marked by an arrow in Fig. 2(a)] appears outside
the allowed transport triangle, indicating that Coulomb
blockade is broken by photon absorption [18] allowing
a hole to tunnel uphill from left to right between two
resonant levels, subsequently escaping to the right lead
[Fig. 2(c) inset]. Measuring the position of this line as

with λ and the inter-dot tunnel coupling tc taken as ﬁt
parameters. As seen, the spectroscopic eﬀect of the tun-
nel coupling tc = 4 ± 7 µeV is negligible within the un-
certainty. The lever arm λ = 0.038 ± 0.002 is consistent
with that obtained from the size of the bias triangle in
Fig. 2(a) [17].

With increased microwave power, multi-photon tran-
sitions can be observed [Fig. 2(d)]. The dependence on
detuning and power is in reasonable agreement with a
model of resonant transitions with dephasing [19, 20]
[Fig. 2(e)]. In particular, the dependence of current on
power is weakly non-monotonic, an indication of inter-
ference between diﬀerent coherent transitions. However,
this eﬀect is masked by a non-resonant current increase
at high power, presumably reﬂecting incoherent tunnel-
ing due to heating. The power oﬀset between simulation
and data allows the ratio between the generator output
and quantum dot detuning to be extracted, which at this
frequency is 68 dB. For the following data the power is
set well below the threshold for multi-photon processes.
By studying PAT as a function of frequency and fridge
temperature T , information about charge dephasing and
hence about the electrical environment can be obtained.
The dephasing time T ∗
2 is extracted from the width
of the PAT peak in detuning [21] using the formula
T ∗
2 = 2h/λeγV , where γV is the full width at half max-
imum of the Lorentzian. Figure 3(a) shows T ∗
2 as a
function of microwave frequency at T = 13 mK, ob-
tained from ﬁts as in Fig. 2(b). The mean value is

We consider ﬁrst vibrational dephasing, by analysing
the phonon spectrum and dominant coupling mecha-
nisms to the charge state. We must consider both
bending and stretching modes as potential contribu-
tors to charge dephasing [20]. For the former, cou-
pling to the charge state arises from displacement of
the quantum dots in the gate electric ﬁeld, whereas the
electron-phonon coupling of longitudinal phonons arises
from the deformation potential. The spectra of bend-
ing and stretching phonons are (neglecting tension) given
by [9, 10, 27, 28]:

where cS ≈ 2 × 104 ms−1 is the longitudinal sound ve-
locity and R and L are the radius and length of the
suspended nanotube. Estimating R = 2 nm and us-
ing L = 650 nm results in ωB1 /2π = 105 MHz and
ωS1 /2π = 15.4 GHz for the lowest frequency bending
and stretching mode.

The respective electron-phonon couplings for bending

and stretching modes are [20]:

Numerical estimates considering the underlying mecha-
nisms [20] give κB ∼ 5 × 1019 s−2 (assuming an electric
ﬁeld E ∼ 107 Vm−1 based on applied gate voltage and
sample geometry, and nanotube mass m ∼ 6× 10−21 kg),
and |κS| ∼ 2 × 1013 s−3/2. In both cases the coupling
strength peaks for the lowest frequency mode.

Dephasing will thus be dominated by thermally pop-
ulated low-frequency modes. Contrary to a previous
treatment of double dot electron-phonon coupling [22]
based on the canonical spin-boson model with quasi-
continuous spectral density [29], we anticipate that only
a small number of modes is relevant in this case, suggest-
ing a diﬀerent approach is required. To estimate T ∗
2 , we
therefore adapt analytically derived Rabi-model dephas-
ing rates [30]. These rely upon a perturbative expansion
utilising the phase space representation of the oscillators.

data and at higher temperatures (not shown), no strong
dependence on frequency is seen. Figure 3(b) shows the
temperature dependence of T ∗
2 averaged over the entire
measured frequency range. As expected, T ∗
2 decreases at
higher temperature, indicating thermally activated de-
phasing mechanisms. To conﬁrm proper thermalization
of the device, Fig. 3(c) shows the measured width of a
Coulomb step feature (the edge of a bias triangle similar
to Fig. 2(a)) as a function of temperature. The linear
dependence across the range indicates that the electron
temperature closely tracks T .
In the rest of this sec-
tion, we compare this data with expectations from vari-

model, where the loss of coherence is determined by the
spectral density [31], Eq. (6) explicitly includes the ﬁ-
nite lifetime of the relevant phonon modes, as well as
the charge bias and tunneling. Generalisation to multi-
ple modes is straightforward [30] but unnecessary here:
for the parameters discussed below inclusion of up to 10
modes gives relative changes of less than 10−4 [20].

by electrical noise at low temperatures, with a possible
contribution from phonons above 50 mK.

Because PAT spectroscopy gives a direct measurement
of the charge dephasing rate, it may shed light on the
cause of dephasing for a valley-spin qubit deﬁned in a
similar device [7].
In that experiment, performed at
270 mK, a voltage-dependent spin splitting made the
qubit sensitive to electrical noise, which was suggested
as the main limit on the decoherence rate. To explain
the measured valley-spin decoherence rate, an rms de-
tuning jitter εrms ∼ 0.1 meV was required. In Fig. 3(b),
the charge T ∗
2 expected from the same detuning jitter is
plotted as a ﬁlled circle, and is found to be of the same
order of magnitude as measured here. It is therefore plau-
sible that charge noise was a contributor to the decoher-
ence and dephasing rates measured for that valley-spin
qubit [7].

The origin of the noise remains unclear. The re-
quired noise level is far in excess of expectation from
our room-temperature electronics, and the temperature
dependence of T ∗
2 is evidence of noise originating in the
device. The fact that the noise is apparently reduced
compared with that in Ref.
[7] (where the nanotube
rested on an oxide layer) suggests a contribution from
the substrate. However, in our device most substrate
noise should be screened by the surface gates. One ori-
gin could be electrostatic patch noise on the electrode
surfaces, as seen in ion traps [37]. Another is possi-
ble presence of ﬂuctuating charge traps on the surface
of the nanotube itself, either in amorphous carbon de-
posited during synthesis, or from adsorbed water. These
results suggest that, provided other decoherence mech-
anisms such as magnetic 13C nuclear impurities can be
eliminated, careful control of nanotube synthesis and/or
vacuum conditions in the cryostat may enhance both
charge and valley-spin coherence in nanotube quantum
dots.

Figure 3(b) shows a ﬁt of T ∗

2 calculated using Eq. (6)
for the lowest frequency bending mode, where κB in
Eq. (4) is taken as the ﬁtting parameter. For the fre-
quency of the lowest mode, measured electromechani-
cally [32, 33], we take ω = 2π × 300 MHz and from the
linewidth γ−1 = 500 ns. The higher value of ω than
in Eq. (2) presumably reﬂects tension in the suspended
nanotube [34]. The ﬁt yields κB ≈ 3.5 × 1019 s−2, in
reasonable agreement with the previous estimate, given
the many uncertainties. By contrast, the lowest stretch-
ing mode [using Eqs. (3) and (5)] leads to dephasing on
a timescale approaching seconds [Fig. 3(b)inset] and can
therefore be ruled out. The calculated T ∗
2 shows almost
no dependence on Ω in the measured temperature range,
consistent with Fig. 3(a). Bearing in mind that Eq. (6)
relies on a perturbative expansion of electron-phonon
coupling, we have checked that full numerical simulations
of a single mode Rabi model using QuTip [35] lead to a
temperature dependence in the dephasing time that is
consistent with Eq. (6) [20].
Thus, while bending mode phonons may limit T ∗
above T ≈ 50 mK, they cannot explain the measure-
ments across the entire temperature range due to the
strong temperature dependence of the phonon model.
This suggests that at least at low temperatures a dif-
ferent mechanism limiting coherence must be at play.
We therefore next compare with expectations from elec-

by T ∗
2h/λ∆εrms, where ∆εrms is the root-mean-
square detuning noise at frequencies up to the driving
frequency [7]. Assuming that the noise spectrum is dom-
inated by frequencies below 10 GHz, this is consistent
with the data in Fig. 3(a) if ∆εrms = 0.02 meV at low T .
There is no clear expectation for the temperature de-
pendence; however, in a GaAs spin qubit device where
dephasing was attributed to thermally activated electro-
static noise, an approximately linear dependence of T ∗
2 on
T was found [36]. This simple model ﬁts the data well
[Fig. 3(b)], meaning charge noise cannot be excluded as
the limit of T ∗

2 across the temperature range.

Finally, we consider that T ∗

2 is set by the lifetime of
the excited state, limited by tunneling to the leads. Be-
cause escape from the right dot is not Coulomb-blocked
[Fig. 2(c) inset], this eﬀect should show no strong tem-
perature dependence, and therefore is not the main limit
on T ∗
2 on
gate voltage tuning, indicating that it is not aﬀected by
tunnel barriers as tunneling or cotunneling would be. In
conclusion, we deduce that charge coherence is limited

ELECTRON-PHONON COUPLING CONSTANTS

Our starting point is the spin-boson Hamiltonian [29,

31]:

HSB = He + Hph + He−ph ,

(S2)

with bare double dot represented by a pseudo-spin Hamil-
tonian

He =

σz + tcσx ,

(S3)
where σz = |L(cid:105)(cid:104)L|−|R(cid:105)(cid:104)R| and σx = |L(cid:105)(cid:104)R| +|R(cid:105)(cid:104)L| for
|L/R(cid:105) representing the presence of the hole on the left
or the right dot, respectively. Each phonon mode with
wavevector q, angular frequency ωq, and ladder operators

and the charge-phonon coupling given by

Here the electron-phonon coupling in each mode is pa-
rameterized by g(ωq).

To estimate g(ω) we express the oscillator displacement
for each wavevector q in terms of the (real-space) position
variable uq,

where m is the mass of the nanotube. Two physical
mechanisms contribute to the electron-phonon interac-
tion: coupling to bending-mode phonons via the gate
electric ﬁeld and coupling to longitudinal phonons via
the deformation potential
[9, 10, 27, 28]. We estimate
them in turn.

Bending-mode phonons

The bending-mode dispersion relation is ωq =
cSRq2/
[9], with q = nπ/L, where R and L are
the radius and length of the nanotube. The deforma-
tion potential associated with these phonons averages to
zero around the nanotube circumference [9], so electron-
phonon coupling arises mainly from the perpendicular
electric ﬁeld E induced by the gates. This mediates cou-
pling to bending-mode phonons according to the Hamil-
tonian

where F (q) ∼ 2/qL is a form factor that parameterizes

Longitudinal phonons

For longitudinal phonons, we must consider both
stretching and torsional modes, with each mode coupling
via both diagonal and oﬀ-diagonal matrix elements in
sublattice space [28]. The dominant term is the diagonal
coupling to stretching-mode phonons, whose dispersion
relation is ωq = cSq. The deformation potential Hamil-
tonian in this case leads to [9]

H S

e−ph =

iGqF (q)uqσz.

where the coupling constant is G ∼ 21 eV. Equating
Eqs. (S9) and (S5) gives

For torsional modes, the dispersion relation is similar and
the coupling constant is about an order of magnitude
smaller [9]. These can therefore be neglected.

Since gB and gS are out of phase, the mechanisms de-
couple to second order and can be treated independently.

The main text only considers the lowest frequency
mode. To verify the validity of this simpliﬁcation, Fig. S1
shows the eﬀect on the predicted dephasing time as the
next higher frequency modes are included at both the
lowest and the highest temperature of the experiment.
In both cases the relative shortening of the dephasing
time is smaller than 10−4.

At low temperature, we can also solve the full dynam-
ics of Hamiltonian (S2) numerically, for example using a
package like QuTip [35]. However, rigorously extracting a
dephasing time is not straightforward: time traces of the
charge qubit’s coherence are rich in features over a long
time in the relevant parameter regime, leading to a rather
messy Fourier spectrum. A possible way of extracting a
crude estimate of the dephasing time is to consider the
amplitude range of coherence oscillations over ten Rabi
periods ξ(τ ) = max|ρ01(t)| for t ∈ [τ, τ + 10× 2π/Ω], and
ﬁnding the smallest τ for which ξ(τ )/ξ(0) < 1/e.
In the low temperature regime T < 0.1 K (where the
Hilbert space can be safely truncated at below 100 ex-
citations) a single mode Rabi model with parameters as
in the main text shows a temperature dependence in the
decay of the qubit coherence that is consistent with the
predictions of Eq. (6) in the main text. We therefore
conclude that the qualitative predictions of Eq. (6) are
indeed adequate for ruling out phonons as the origin of
low temperature charge dephasing.

APPROXIMATION OF DEPHASING TIME

Ref. 30 allows us obtain an analytical estimate of the
‘spin’ coherence time in the presence of one or more os-
cillator modes. This is more appropriate than solutions
to the canonical spin-boson model, as the discrete oscil-
lator environment is too small to assume short environ-
mental correlations times. By contrast, the phase space
representation technique [30] is capable of resolving non-
Markovian dynamics of combined charge qubit and oscil-
lator(s). Note that in our case the qubit dephasing will
be predominantly caused by oscillator relaxation.
