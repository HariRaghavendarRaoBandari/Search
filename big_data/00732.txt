ABSTRACT

We analyze the possibility that several instability points may be formed, due to the Paczy´nski
mechanism of violation of mechanical equilibrium, in the orbiting matter around a supermassive
Kerr black hole. We consider recently proposed model of ringed accretion disk, made up by
several tori (rings) which can be corotating or counterrotating relative to the Kerr attractor
due to the history of the accretion process. Each torus is governed by the general relativistic
hydrodynamic Boyer condition of equilibrium conﬁgurations of rotating perfect ﬂuids. We prove
that the number of the instability points is generally limited and depends on the dimensionless
spin of the rotating attractor.

Introduction

The physics of accretion disks around very compact objects as supermassive black holes (BH) in active
galactic nuclei (AGN) or quasars is the basis of the phenomenology of the high energy astrophysics. The
instability phases of the orbiting toroidal conﬁgurations are particularly relevant during the accretion phase
onto the black hole and launching of jets of matter and radiation. On one side an important issue is
description of the mechanisms by which jets are launched and formed, on the other side, the relation between
material in accretion and the jet power has to be clariﬁed.

An important subject of investigation concerns the dynamics of the entire black hole-disk system, which
could also result in processes producing instability of the entire system. It is often assumed that the rotational
energy of the attractor may have a role in the energy extraction and conversion of matter in jet-like structures,
when the gravitational binding energy of accreting matter is transformed into radiation. An intriguing issue
consists in signiﬁcance of the gravo-hydrostatic contribution to the jet formation and structure. Existence
of a possible jet-accretion correlation itself is subject of many theoretical and observational investigation.
Various analysis suggest that a signiﬁcant part of matter going through the accretion point would possibly
power or feed the launching jets. Therefore, we could actually consider an accretion-ejection engine by
referring the accretion disk being connected to the relativistic jets.

The quest of a jet-accretion correlation for the formation and feeding of jets, or also the morphological
deformation of the matter funnels would provide several constraints for any model of accretion and jet
formation, depending also on the dimensionless spin of the black hole. In fact, the jet formation appears
to be strongly related to the intrinsic rotation of the central attractor Lovelace et al. (2014). The role of
spin and magnetic ﬁeld in accretion disks and relativistic jets is discussed for example in McKinney et al.
(2013) while the relation between accretion rate and jet power in x-ray luminous elliptical galaxies has been
exploited in Allen et al.
(2006). Creation of jets by accretion disks orbiting magnetized black holes has
been recently proposed in Stuchl´ık&Kolos (2016).

The observational evidences for an accretion-disk origin for a radio jet in an active galaxy is discussed in
Marscher et al. (2002). For the jet-disk connection and blazar uniﬁcation see (Maraschi&Tavecchio 2003;

1

Chen et al. 2015; Yu et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2015). For the the disk-jet connection in AGN see Sbarrato
et al. (2014) and Coughlin&Begelman (2014). For the stellar BH casefor example Maitra et al. (2009) and
Fender&Munoz-Darias (2015).

Jets from geometrically thick disk were studied in (Abramowicz&Sharp 1983; Sadowski&Narayan 2015;
Okuda et al. 2005; Ferreira&Casse 2004; Lyutikov 2009). Theoretical models for the production of relativistic
jets of active galactic nuclei predict that jet power is governed by the spin and mass of the central super-
massive black hole, as well as by the magnetic ﬁeld near the event horizon Ghisellini et al. (2014), while no
correlation between disk height and jet power appears in GR-MHD simulations presented in Fragile et al.
(2012). Focusing on the general problem of the role of the accretion disk-jet connection one can question if
any changes in the inner part of the disk should produce changes in the jet launching. For example Miller
et al. (2012) suggest that the jet is not aﬀected by changes in the inner radius of the accretion disk, but
it depends on some of the disk properties, as its ﬂux, temperature, and ionization. Further open question
is the role of the inner margin of the accretion disk in the jet processes, namely the role of the marginally
stable circular orbit (ISCO), as the deﬁnition of the inner margin of the accretion disk is extensively debated
(Krolik&Hawley 2002; Bromley et al. 1998; Abramowicz et al. 2010; Agol&Krolik 2000; Paczy´nski 2000).
Some results lead to the conclusions that a standard thin accretion disk that extends to the ISCO can drive
relativistic jets Miller et al. (2012).

In the present article we consider the emergence of several instability points in a ringed diskPugliese&Stuchl´ık

(2015). The instability points can be associated to accretion into the black hole, or irregular points of critical
surfaces representing open structures of matter funnels, the proto-jets (Kozlowski et al. 1978; Abramowicz et
al. 1978; Sadowski et al. 2015; Lasota et. al. 2015; Lyutikov 2009; Madau 1988; Sikora 1981; Stuchl´ık et al.
2009, 2015; Slan´y&Stuchl´ık 2005; Stuchl´ık 2005). We study diﬀerent kinds of gravo-hydrostatic instability
points assuming the hydrostatic pressure and gravitational eﬀects of a Kerr black hole background requir-
ing a full general relativistic treatment of geometrically thick accretion disks. We realize the analysis in
the framework of the ringed accretion disks (or macro-structures) recently introduced in Pugliese&Stuchl´ık
(2015). The ringed accretion disk model is made up by several rings rotating around a super massive Kerr
black hole attractor which could be created in various regimes during the evolution of matter conﬁgurations
around supermassive black holes. We start by the consideration that diﬀerent parts of the orbiting material
around a super-massive spinning black hole, characterized by diﬀerent speciﬁc angular momentum, may give
rise to instability in diﬀerent points, inducing eventually an overall instability of the entire ringed orbiting
structure.

In modelling the evolution of supermassive black holes in AGNs both corotating and counter-rotating
accretion stages are mixed(Volonteri et al. 2003a; Carmona-Loaiza et al. 2015; Dyda et al. 2015;
Hohlfeld&Lovelace 2014). Therefore, the galactic nuclei containing a supermassive black hole could be
an environment where these macro-structure can be observed. Toroidal rings might be formed as remnants
of several accretion regimes occurred in various phases of the black hole life Alig et al. (2013); King&Pringle
(2007, 2006); Lovelace&Chou (1996); Gafton et al. (2015). These sub-structures could be eventually reani-
mated in non isolated systems where the central attractor is interacting with the environment, or in some
kinds of binary systems. Some additional matter, for example, could be supplied into the vicinity of the
central black hole due to tidal distortion of a starMiller et al. (2015). Possible observational evidences of
these conﬁgurations were also discussed in (Karas&Sochora 2010; Sochora et al. 2011), more generally a
possible evidence of the existence of the ringed accretion disk can be inferred from the study of the optical
properties of the disk (Stuchl´ık&Schee 2012, 2010).

The individual toroidal (thick disk) conﬁgurations (the rings or sub-conﬁgurations) are here described
by the purely hydrodynamic (barotropic) model. The Polish Doughnut (P-D) model Abramowicz&Fragile
(2013) is an example of a thick, opaque and super-Eddington, radiation pressure supported accretion disks
cooled by advection with low viscosity Abramowicz et al. (1983). Each toroid of the ringed disk is assumed
being governed by the General Relativity hydrodynamic Boyer condition of equilibrium conﬁgurations of
rotating perfect ﬂuids. The eﬀects of strong gravitational ﬁelds are dominant with respect to the dissipative
ones and predominant to determine the unstable phases of the system (Font&Daigne 2002b; Igumenshchev

2

2000; Abramowicz&Fragile 2013; Pugliese&Montani 2015; Paczy´nski 1980), where the entropy is constant
along the ﬂow. The von Zeipel condition is veriﬁed and accordingly the surfaces of constant angular velocity
Ω and of constant speciﬁc angular momentum (cid:96) coincide (Abramowicz 1971; Chakrabarti 1990, 1991; Zan-
otti&Pugliese 2014) and the rotation law (cid:96) = (cid:96)(Ω) is independent of the equation of state (Lei et al. 2008;
Abramowicz 2008; Abramowicz et al. 1978). Properties of each tori can be then determined by an eﬀective
potential reﬂecting the background Kerr geometry. The equipotential surfaces associated with critical points
identify the toroidal surfaces of the disk. The cusped surfaces are the critical topologies associated to the
unstable phases of the conﬁgurations. The outﬂow of matter through the cusp occuers by the Paczy´nski-
Wiita (P-W) mechanism of violation of mechanical equilibrium of the tori, i.e. an instability in the balance
of the gravitational and inertial forces and the pressure gradients in the ﬂuidAbramowicz&Fragile (2013).

As in Pugliese&Stuchl´ık (2015) we consider the ringed disk where the centers of all the individual tori are
coplanar, coinciding with the equatorial plane of the Kerr attractor. This assumption of coincidence between
the orbital planes of the rings and the equatorial plane of the axisymmetric attractor, is the simplest scenario
for the majority of the current analytical and numerical models of the extended accreting matter1. We face
particularly the problem of location of the inner and outer edges of the toroidal conﬁgurations and the
critical points with respect to the marginally bounded and marginally stable circular orbits. This analysis
provides the basis for the attractor classiﬁcations. The rings are related by boundary conditions dictated by
the condition of not penetration of matter and by the geometric constraint for the equilibrium conﬁgurations
determined by the geometric properties of the Kerr background reﬂected by its geodesic structure. The
condition of non-penetration of matter was considered in Pugliese&Stuchl´ık (2015) in a very restrictive way,
avoiding collisions in the macro-structure. As a consequence of this assumption only a point of instability
would be possible in the macro-conﬁguration. In the present article we weaken this request, investigating
the possibility that there may be several P-W points for a given macro-conﬁguration. We distinguish ﬁve
types of unstable couples of orbiting conﬁgurations (states of the macro-conﬁgurations). Not all these states
can actually exist. We prove that their formation and stability depends on the dimensionless spin of the
attractor, the relative rotation of the tori with respect to the attractor, and more importantly, the relative
rotation of the ﬂuids in the ringed disk. Considering the possible combination of these states, we investigate
also ringed disks consisting of more than two rings and a possible state correlation occurring when two
surfaces are in contact leading to collision phenomena and eventually to a topological transition of the state
and, consequently, of the entire macro-conﬁguration. We face the problem of the state evolution considering
the condition for an initial couple of conﬁgurations (starting state) could evolve towards a transition of the
surface topologies with emergence of instability.

This article is structured as follows: in the ﬁrst brief descriptive part, Sec. (2) the ringed disk model is
introduced and some general considerations on the instability points are discussed. Sec. (3) addresses brieﬂy
the main outcomes of the analysis focusing on the states properties, details will be provided in future studies.
Concluding remarks can be found in Sec. (4).

2. Rings in the Kerr spacetime

In this section, we introduce the main notation used in this work and we will make reference also to some
basic notions introduced in Pugliese&Stuchl´ık (2015). The Kerr metric tensor in the Boyer-Lindquist (BL)
coordinates {t, r, θ, φ} reads

ds2 = −dt2 +

2012; Nixon et al. 2012a,b, 2013; Dunhill et al. 2014; Nixon et al. 2011) where also strongly misaligned disks with respect to
the central supermassive BH spin are considered.

where r+ < r+
 = 2M in the equatorial plane θ = π/2. We consider toroidal conﬁgurations
of perfect ﬂuids orbiting a Kerr black hole (BH) attractor. Importantly, the Kerr geometry has two Killing
vectors: ξφ = ∂φ, rotational Killing ﬁeld, and ξt = ∂t, which is the Killing ﬁeld representing the stationarity
of the spacetime. Line element (1) is indeed independent of φ and t. Consequently, the quantities

E ≡ −gαβξα

t pβ = −pt, L ≡ gαβξα

φ pβ = pφ ,

(3)

are constants of motionand pa is the particle four–momentum. We can limit the analysis of the test particle
circular motion to the case of positive values of a for corotating (L > 0) and counterrotating (L < 0)
orbits with respect to the black hole.
In fact the metric tensor (1) is invariant under the application of
any two diﬀerent transformations: xα → −xα for one of the coordinates (t, φ), or the metric parameter a
and, consequently, the test particle dynamics is invariant under the mutual transformation of the parameters
(a, L) → (−a,−L). The constant L in Eq. (3) may be interpreted as the axial component of the angular
momentum of a particle for timelike geodesics and E as representing the total energy of the test particle
coming from radial inﬁnity, as measured by a static observer at inﬁnity. In this work we deal with a one-
species particle perfect ﬂuid system, which is described by the energy momentum tensor

Tαβ = ( + p)uαuβ + pgαβ,

(4)

where  and p are the total energy density and pressure, respectively, as measured by an observer comoving
with the ﬂuid whose four-velocity uα is a timelike ﬂow vector ﬁeld. The ﬂuid dynamics is described by the
continuity equation and the Euler equation respectively:

uα∇α + (p + )∇αuα = 0 ,

(p + )uα∇αuγ + hβγ∇βp = 0 ,

(5)
where ∇αgβγ = 0 and for the symmetries of the problem, we assume ∂tQ = 0 and ∂ϕQ = 0, with Q being
a generic spacetime tensor. In Eq. (5), hαβ = gαβ + uαuβ is the projection tensor (Pulgiese&Kroon 2012;
Pugliese&Montani 2015). Assuming a barotropic equation of state p = p(), we investigate the ﬂuid toroidal
conﬁgurations (with uθ = 0) centered on the plane θ = π/2, and deﬁned by the constraint ur = 0. Thus, in
this setup we ﬁnd from the Euler equation (5)

(the continuity equation in Eq. (5) is identically satisﬁed as consequence of the applied conditions and sym-

(P-W) potential, reﬂecting the background Kerr geometry and the centrifugal eﬀects, and we assume here a
constant and conserved speciﬁc angular momentum (cid:96) (see also (Lei et al. 2008; Abramowicz 2008)). Finally,
Ω is the relativistic angular frequency of the ﬂuid relative to the distant observer. Similarly to the case
of the test particle dynamics, the function Vef f ((cid:96)) in Eq. (6) is invariant under the mutual transformation
of the parameters (a, (cid:96)) → (−a,−(cid:96)). Therefore, we can limit the analysis to positive values of a > 0,

and [uϕ] = [uθ] = [M ]−1 with [uϕ/ut] = [M ]−1 and [uϕ/ut] = [M ]. For the seek of convenience, we always consider the

for corotating ((cid:96) > 0) and counterrotating ((cid:96) < 0) ﬂuids and we adopt the notation (±) for counterro-
tating or corotating matter respectively. We consider a fully general relativistic model of ringed accretion
disk formed by several corotating and counterrotating toroidal rings orbiting a supermassive Kerr attractor
(Pugliese&Stuchl´ık 2015). In a given spacetime characterized by the dimensionless spin (a/M ), each toroid
of the ringed disk is governed by the General Relativity hydrodynamic Boyer condition of equilibrium con-
ﬁgurations of rotating perfect ﬂuids. According to the Boyer theory on the equipressure surfaces applied to
a P-D torus, the toroidal surfaces are the equipotential surfaces of the eﬀective potential Vef f ((cid:96), r), solutions
of Vef f = K =constant or ln(Vef f ) = c = constant (Boyer 1965; Frank et al. 2002). These correspond also
to the surfaces of constant density, speciﬁc angular momentum (cid:96), and constant relativistic angular frequency
Ω, where Ω = Ω((cid:96)) as a consequence of the von Zeipel theorem (Abramowicz 1971; Zanotti&Pugliese 2014).
Each Boyer surface is uniquely identiﬁed by the couple of parameters p ≡ ((cid:96), K). Since the toroidal con-
ﬁguration can be corotating, (cid:96)a > 0, or counterrotating, (cid:96)a < 0, with respect to the black hole rotation
(a > 0), assuming ﬁrst a couple (Ca, Cb) with speciﬁc angular momentum ((cid:96)a, (cid:96)b), orbiting in the equatorial
plane of a given Kerr BH, we need to introduce the concept of (cid:96)corotating disks, deﬁned by the condition
(cid:96)a(cid:96)b > 0, and (cid:96)counterrotating disks deﬁned by the relations (cid:96)a(cid:96)b < 0. The two (cid:96)corotating tori can be both
corotating, (cid:96)a > 0, or counterrotating, (cid:96)a < 0, with respect to the central attractor. Fig. (1) represents a
ringed accretion disk with equilibrium conﬁgurations and open (Ox proto-jet) surfaces. It will be important

the presence of critical points is regulated mainly by geometric factors (Pugliese&Montani 2015; Pugliese et
al. 2012). Following the discussion in Pugliese&Stuchl´ık (2015) for the unstable modes of a ringed tori, we
consider here two types of instabilities emerging in an orbiting macro-structure, leading to a global insta-
bility in the ringed disk. Correspondingly, we can distinguish two distinct models of unstable ringed torus
Cn(cid:12), with the number r ∈ [0, n − 1] (rank of the Cn(cid:12) torus) of contact points between the boundaries of two
x, with rx ∈ [0, n] instability P-W points. The number rx is
consecutive rings, and the macro-structure Cn

In this article, we consider the existence of several instability points investigating the Cn

x. Finally, we have the macro-structure Cx(cid:12)n, characterized at last by one
called rank of the ringed disk Cn
contact point that is also an instability point. The P-W local instability aﬀects one or more rings of the
ringed disk decomposition, and then it can destabilize the whole ringed disk in the initial Cn
x topology for
collisions of matter between the unstable ring and its consecutive sub-conﬁgurations, resulting eventually
in a diﬀerent topology of the entire macro-structure, when the rings are no more separated and a feeding
(overlapping) of material occurs. As proved in Pugliese&Stuchl´ık (2015), if rx = 1 and the inner ring C1
x of
its decomposition is in accretion, then the whole ringed disk could be globally stable if the outer edge of the
accreting ring satisﬁes proper conditions on the ﬂuid speciﬁc angular momentum.
x models with rank
rx ∈ [1, n], which could also include the open and cusped Ox sub-conﬁgurations and the situations where
two rings may be in contact or geometrically correlated according to constraints settled on their morphology
or topology evolution and the geodesic structure of the spacetime. A contact in this model causes collision
and penetration of matter, eventually with the feeding of one sub-conﬁguration with material and supply
of speciﬁc angular momentum of another consecutive ring of the decomposition. This mechanism could
possibly end in a change of the ring disk morphology and topology. In the following sections we will face the
analysis of the n order decomposition starting from the characterization of the conﬁgurations of the order
n = 2. These can be regarded as seeds for the construction of higher-order macro-conﬁgurations generated
from this initial couple. We deﬁne as state or main state a ringed disk of the order n = 2 with ﬁxed topology.
The notion of state is useful to clarify diﬀerent aspects of the macro-conﬁguration structure and evolution
and to deal with the many diﬀerent cases occurring even for one couple of rings. In fact, a ringed disk of
the order n = 2, with ﬁxed equal critical topology could be in n = 8 diﬀerent states according to their
rotation and relative position of the centers: n = 4 diﬀerent states, if the rings are (cid:96)corotanting, and n = 4
for (cid:96)countorrotating rings, considering also the relative location of points of minimum pressure. Then, the
couple (Cx, Ox), with diﬀerent but ﬁxed topology, could be in n = 16 diﬀerent states. For a main state
Ci − ()x, considering also the class of magnitude Li where i = {1, 2, 3} for the equilibrium conﬁguration, we
need to address n = 48 diﬀerent states. As a result of our analysis we are able to reduce all these possible
states to the ones listed in Table (1), whereas details on the restrictions for combinations of diﬀerent states
in ringed disks made up by more then two rings will be presented in future studyPugliese&Stuchl´ık (2016).
We will consider therefore ﬁve main states, with at last one critical topology determining the constraints on
the state existence and evolution. We will prove that not all the initial and ﬁnal states are possible and not
all the evolutions are actually possible in all spacetimes.

3. States and macro-conﬁguration

To simplify the presentation of the results, we summarize in this section comments on Tables (1), (2)
and (3) which schematically introduce some main outcomes of this analysis, whereas we specify the diﬀerent
states for the (cid:96)corotating couples in Pugliese&Stuchl´ık (2016) where we extend our investigation to the
multiple conﬁgurations of the decomposition of the order n > 2 providing also evidence of the results and
the detailed comments on each case. First we point out that

if

()i < ()o,

where

(cid:96)i(cid:96)o > 0,

then ()i (cid:31) ()o, where

() ∈ {C, Cx, Ox}.

(7)

For the ordered sequences of surface, with the notation < or >, we intend the ordered sequence of maximum
points of the pressure, or rmin, minimum of the eﬀective potential and the conﬁguration centers. In relation
to a couple of rings, the terms “internal” (inner) or “external” (outer), will always refer, unless otherwise
speciﬁed, to the sequence ordered according to the center location. If Ci < Cj then, for i < j, Ci is the
inner ring, the closest to attractor with respect to Cj, and there is ri
cent. Within
these deﬁnitions, the rings (Ci, Ci+1) and (Ci−1, Ci) are consecutive as Ci−1 < Ci < Ci+1(Pugliese&Stuchl´ık
2015). The symbols (cid:31) and ≺ refer instead to the sequentiality according to the location of the minimum
points of the pressure, or rM ax, maximum point of the eﬀective potential (in L1 or L2). Thus, for the
(cid:96)corotanting sequence there is ()i < ()o and ()i (cid:31) ()o. Then, the largest is the magnitude of the ﬂuid

cent ≡ ri

min < rj

speciﬁc angular momentum and the largest is the radius of the maximum pressure point and more stretched
on the equatorial plane is the conﬁguration, the nearest to the BH is the instability point. The situation for
a (cid:96)counterrotating couple with a critical conﬁguration is determined by the two families of the notable radii
r±
N and by the associated speciﬁc angular momenta (cid:96)±
N –see Figs.t (2). The discussion of this case is more
articulated than the (cid:96)corotating case. Table (1) summarizes these results. In order to prove these results we

non-correlated conﬁgurations, or ((cid:54)C∗) with particularly restrictive conditions to be satisﬁed for a correlation
to occur–seePugliese&Stuchl´ık (2016).

N ∈ ()± and of r±

addressed the issue of the location of the matter distribution ()± with respect to notable radii the rN . This
is in fact important particularly in the determination of a possible correlation between rings. We discuss
N ∈ ()∓. It is worth noting
the case of (cid:96)corotating matter, investigating the inclusion3 of r±
here that this investigation actually matches the broader problematic of the location of the inner edge of the
disk–see (Krolik&Hawley 2002; Bromley et al. 1998; Abramowicz et al. 2010; Agol&Krolik 2000; Paczy´nski
N ∈ ()±, a discussion of the
2000). Indeed, this investigation will often imply, especially for the inclusion r±
location of these radii with respect to the inner margin of the disk, while the location of the outer edge turns
N ∈ ()∓ case. Note that the accretion or proto-jet
to be important especially for the discussion of the r±
instability of any sub-conﬁguration is essentially sorted at the inner edge of each ring. Conversely, in the
accretion ringed disks, an accretion point or launching point of proto-jet can emerge at any inner margin of
any of its rings. Therefore, contrary to the common scenario for a single thick accretion disk, such points
of instabilities can emerge in the middle of the macro-structure. Tables (2) and (3) summarize the main
results of this analysis. Table (1) ﬁxes the ﬁve seed states with at least one cusped topology and the
possible correlation, establishing also the critical and centers sequentiality, i.e., the relative location of rings
of a couple in a particular geometry. We introduce the spin classes:

ι ≡ [0, aι[ and A>

Some states are uniquely ﬁxed, some states are not possible. The correlation is possible in all corotating
couples, according to a proper choice of the “density” K-parameter. The ring separation induced on the
(cid:96)counterrotating couples, due to the attractor rotation, acts in general to forbid or to disadvantage the
correlation–see also Pugliese&Stuchl´ık (2015). This situation is obviously less clear as the spin of the attractor
decreases. This would imply that the (cid:96)counterrotating ring dynamics can be often described as collection of

3The inclusion notation, (∈, (cid:54)∈) and ∈!, will be widely used in Tables (2,3). The use of ¯r ∈ (), for the radius ¯r and any surface (),
means that there can be found proper K or (cid:96) parameters such that this property is satisﬁed. The symbol ∈ ! is a reinforcement
of this inclusion, indicating that this is a necessary relation which is always satisﬁed. The symbol (cid:54)∈ (meaning non-inclusion)
does not generally have any intensiﬁer (!), which is also used in Table (1), as this analysis is to underline the possibility of
inclusion and the condition for this to be satisﬁed.

independent (separate) conﬁgurations. A more detailed look of Table (1) reveals that in the (cid:96)counterrotating
case the angular momentum is not suﬃcient to uniquely ﬁx the state and its correlation, but the situation
depends on the dimensionless spin of the attractor.
In conclusion, the proto jet-accretion correlation is
always possible, except in the (cid:96)counterrotating couples in the geometries of the fastest attractors4, A>
ιa, with
corotating ﬂuid in accretion and counterrotating proto-jet where the point of accretion is always inner with
respect to rJ . The case of accretion of counterrotating matter and corotating proto-jet is favored, according
to the constraints, in any Kerr geometry, while the case of corotating accretion disk, and counterrotating
matter with launching point inner or coincident with the accretion point is favored in the geometries of the
slow attractors, A<
ιa. A Ox-Ox correlation (i.e. a double-shell of open conﬁgurations in contact), is always
possible except for the fast attractors, A>
ι , where it is prohibited for an outer counterrotating proto-jet;
it is possible for any combination of launching points at low spin geometries A<
ι . The accretion-accretion
correlation is possible but with an inner corotating accretion point. The accretion-equilibrium correlation
is impossible or not favored for attractors with large spins A>
ιa (being restrictive conditions on the ring
parameters) for the counterrotating disk, which must be the outer of the couple with respect to corotating
accreting disk. In the case of corotating equilibrium disks a correlation is possible. The proto jet-equilibrium
correlation is not possible if there is a corotating jproto-et, and not favored, if the corotating equilibrium
disk is outer with respect to the proto-jet conﬁguration. Table (2) indicates the location of the orbiting
conﬁgurations with respect to the (cid:96)corotating geodesic structure of the Kerr geometry, where there is

We analyzed the inclusion relations r±
marginally bound orbit is never included in any equilibrium or accretion topology. This implies that the
disk inner edge must be always external to this, whereas the launching point of proto-jet must be internal.
The marginally stable orbit must be always included in any unstable ring and it can also be included in the
equilibrium C±
1 conﬁguration with a density lower then the critical one (K < KM ax). The crossing of the
marginally stable orbit does not lead, by itself, to the P-W instability. The situation at higher spin is much
more complex and depends generally on two classes of attractors and the direction of rotation of the ﬂuid
with respect to these. For corotating disks in L2, whose unstable mode is a proto-jet, orbiting fast attractors,
˘A>, the marginally stable orbit can be included in their equilibrium conﬁgurations (rin < r−
mso depending
on the K-parameter). At lower spins, ˘A<, this cannot occur (as rin > r−
mso) but for lower speciﬁc angular

10

momentum. For the counterrotating conﬁgurations the occurrence of r+
2 does not depend directly
on the attractors but again for high magnitudes of speciﬁc angular momentum, the marginally stable orbit is
not included in the disk, the limiting speciﬁc angular momenta being however function of the dimensionless
a/M (Pugliese&Stuchl´ık 2016). At higher speciﬁc angular momentum magnitudes, L3, for which there is no
mso for ˘A<, while in ˘A> the
unstable mode, there has to be r+
marginally stable orbit may be included in C−

This analysis provides also more restrictive constraints for the location of the inner edge of a ring, providing

The study of the inclusion of the ring margins with respect to the (cid:96)counterrotating geodesic structure
of the Kerr geometry is essential to establish a possible correlation between the (cid:96)counterrotating ﬂuids and
related evolution. Several results of this analysis were in fact used in Table (1)–see also Pugliese&Stuchl´ık
(2016). We focus ﬁrst on the counterrotating ﬂuids. According to Table (3), the proto-jet launching point
can be internal to r−
ι , and low speciﬁc angular momenta in magnitude only.
Then the launching point must be external to r−
. It must be internal for slower
attractors, and in A>
ιa for suﬃciently high angular momentum magnitudes. It must be internal for low spins,
A<

ιa , and for all values of speciﬁc angular momentum.
We focus now on the inner edge of the counterrotating disk in equilibrium or in accretion with respect to
rmso. At this point the analysis is more complicated because the double geodesic structure includes crossing
points between the elements of r±
N , therefore the situation strongly depends on the geometric properties
of the Kerr spacetimes.We show that the ratio (cid:96)/a must have speciﬁc characteristics for an instability to
emerge. Concerning the accretion points, the most signiﬁcant aspect perhaps is that the point of accretion
must be internal with respect to r+
ιa geometries–
Table (3). Viceversa, we have to take into account if the ﬂuid is orbiting A<
ιa attractors with suﬃciently high
speciﬁc momentum magnitude. On the other hand, focusing on the C +
mso
without being unstable, but it cannot contain r−
ιa class,
it can be included viceversa for suﬃciently slower spin attractors, A<
ιa and large magnitude of the speciﬁc
angular momentum. The inner edge of the equilibrium C +

slow attractors and speciﬁc angular momentum with a suﬃciently low magnitude.

We addressed instabilities emerging in the ringed accretion disks introduced in Pugliese&Stuchl´ık (2015),
considering in particular conditions for the emergence of unstable phases for each ring according to the P-W
mechanism and the condition for the destabilization of macro-conﬁguration after a rings collision. First, we
proved that the existence of a couple of rings is strongly constrained with respect to the relative location
of the conﬁgurations in the couple, the ring instability, the relative rotation, and the rotation with respect
to the attractor and, in the case of (cid:96)counterrotating rings, the dimensionless spin on the central Kerr black
hole. Considering ringed disks with at last one critical point, we established the orbital and critical rings
sequentiality, the location of instability points, and the inner and outer margins of each ring, as well as the
emergence of possible contact points between two sub-conﬁgurations (correlation), which can lead to collision
in a Cn(cid:12) unstable macro-conﬁguration–Table (1). Some results of this investigation naturally apply to the
case of only one accretion disk, which can be considered as the simplest ringed disk of the order n = 1. The
analysis, in the framework of the ringed disks, in particular th clariﬁes signiﬁcant and widely debated issue of
the location of the inner (and outer) edge of an accretion disk, where in general emergence of P-W instability
occurs. We constrained the location of the inner and outer edges of each toroidal ring according to its speciﬁc
angular momentum, and the geodesics structure of the Kerr spacetime, and the K-parameter involved in the
ring density deﬁnition–Tables (2,3). This study was in fact relevant in the determination of rings relative
location and the recognition of correlation. Properties of the ringed disk, reﬂected in Tables (1,2,3), could
be used to identify the background geometry in one of the particular class of attractors considered here.
Highlighting the possibility that there may be structures formed by more then one accretion torus orbiting
around a Kerr attractor we believe that present work could have signiﬁcance in the high-energy astrophysics,
playing possibly a signiﬁcant role in some of already observed phenomena, namely in terms of interaction
and dynamics of several rings of the macro-conﬁguration. The unstable modes and the ring collisions could
lead to several phenomena eventually involving the attractor itself, like for example the runaway instability
(Abramowicz et al. 1983, 1998; Rezzolla et al. 2003; Font&Daigne 2002a; Hamersky&Karas 2013; Korobkin
et al. 2013). From methodological point of view, by considering a purely hydrodynamic model with a
constant speciﬁc angular momentum, this analysis captures some signiﬁcant aspects of the basic geometric
properties of the extended matter conﬁgurations, considered in some way as the relativistic generalization
of geodesic structure to the extended objects with pressure gradients, relevant for this structure. Thus,
the considerations traced here could be applicable also for more general models where the speciﬁc angular
momentum is not constant along the disk Lei et al. (2008). A further generalization of this work should
consider the role of the magnetic ﬁelds in the macro-structures.
