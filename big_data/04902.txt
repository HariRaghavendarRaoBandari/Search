We examine non-Markovian eﬀects in an open quantum system from the point of view of infor-
mation ﬂow. To this end, we consider the spin-boson model with a cold reservoir, accounting for
the exact time-dependent correlations between the system and the bath to study the exchange of
information and heat. We use an information theoretic measure of the relevant memory eﬀects and
demonstrate that the information backﬂow from the reservoir to the system does not necessarily
correlate with the backﬂow of heat. We also examine the inﬂuence of temperature and coupling
strength on the loss and gain of information between the system and the bath. Finally, we discuss
how additional driving changes the backﬂow of information, giving rise to potential applications in
reservoir engineering.

Introduction.

In all practical applications quantum
systems are open and there is coupling to an external en-
vironment or a reservoir, a heat bath. In modeling open
quantum systems the environment considered is usually
memoryless i.e. Markovian, and therefore detrimental for
any quantum coherences. While it is well known for many
condensed matter settings that the Markovian approxi-
mation does not hold, this fact has mainly been consid-
ered as a nuisance, giving rise to additional mathematical
complexity. Recently, however, a number of results have
appeared in the literature indicating that non-Markovian
dynamics and, more precisely, the occurrence of informa-
tion backﬂow in the system, may be seen as a resource
for certain speciﬁc information tasks [1–5]. The possi-
bility of using information backﬂow in combination of
reservoir engineering techniques motivates the use of non-
Markovianity measures or quantiﬁers, as those deﬁned in
Refs. [2, 6–8]. The systems studied in this context typi-
cally involve a structured environment, resulting in time-
dependent decay rates in the eﬀective master equation.
To the contrary, heat baths considered as environments
in standard condensed matter settings do not typically
have structured spectral densities. The spin-boson model
[17,18] in a cold environment, considered in this Letter,
is a paradigmatic example of this situation. Despite the
undoubted importance of this model in condensed mat-
ter physics, the question of whether or not this system
exhibits non-Markovianity in the information-theoretical
sense has not yet been answered. This is one of the main
goals of the present Letter.

Driven open quantum systems have been in the fo-
cus recently also with respect to non-equilibrium quan-
tum thermodynamics [9–17]. Here the importance of
non-Markovian eﬀects is highlighted by recent experi-
mental [18–23] and theoretical [24–27] works on realis-
ing the ubiquitous Maxwell’s Demon in strongly coupled
single electron and qubit devices. Also, a theoretical

preparations (black and white) of an open system decays in
time (shades of grey) if the dynamics is Markovian and even-
tually vanishes in the absence of decoherence free subspaces.
(b) For non-Markovian dynamics, the distinguishability can

between the two systems.

framework has been developed based on the concept of
a non-equilibrium subsystem, where some of the degrees
of freedom of the reservoir are driven out of equilibrium
by the system-bath correlations, leading to extra entropy
production terms [17]. However, entropy alone does not
constitute a good measure of information exchange [28].
Therefore, proper information theoretic tools and their
relation to heat exchange should be examined.

In the present Letter we consider a simple but realistic
model, the coupled spin-boson quantum system, where
the bosonic heat bath has a well-deﬁned spectral density
and its properties can be adjusted by changing its tem-
perature. We use the stochastic Liouville-von Neumann
scheme to study the dynamics of the spin-boson system
at low temperatures, accounting for the exact system-
bath correlations giving rise to non-Markovian eﬀects.
We employ the Breuer-Laine-Piilo (BLP) measure [6]

to quantify non-Markovianity. Our results demonstrate
that non-Markovian eﬀects arise in the driven spin-boson
model at low temperatures, and are not necessarily corre-
lated with the exchange of heat between the system and
the bath. We also discuss how external driving could be
used as a resource in quantum environmental engineer-
ing.
The Model. We consider here a simple but realistic
model where a two level system (TLS) HS = −(¯hω/2)σx
is coupled to a bosonic heat bath [29, 30], where ω is
the system frequency and σx is a spin Pauli matrix. The
full Hamiltonian is given by H = HS + HI + HR, with
the reservoir and the interaction Hamiltonians HR =
†
k + bk), respectively.
The reservoir is modelled by a large number of quan-
tum harmonic oscillators with frequencies ωk, as well as
†
the annihilation bk and creation b
k operators. The im-
pact of the reservoir on the system depends only on its
thermal energy kBT ≡ 1/β and spectral density function
J(ω). Here, we consider an Ohmic spectral density with
a large algebraic cut-oﬀ ωc, J(ω) = ¯hγω/(1 + (ω/ωc)2)2,
where γ is a dimensionless coupling constant [29][36]. Un-
like in many other quantum information theoretic stud-
ies, the cut-oﬀ frequency ωc here is chosen to be large
enough (ωc = 10ω) such that it is not the source of non-
Markovian eﬀects in our system. Nevertheless, for low
temperatures and large coupling strength (typical of, e.g.,
superconducting devices), the Born-Markov approxima-
tion is not applicable, as the dynamics of the open system
becomes non-local in time. An exact equation for the re-
duced density matrix of the system ρ(t) can be derived
from the path integral formalism [29] and it is known
as the stochastic Liouville-von Neumann equation (SLN)
[31, 32]:
ν(t){σz, ρZ} .
˙ρZ (t) = − i
¯h
(1)
This equation holds for a single noise realisation Z ≡
{ξ, ν}. The correlation functions of the two complex-
valued noise forcing terms ξ(t) and ν(t) reproduce the
complex-valued and temporally non-local force-force au-
tocorrelation function of the bath. Therefore, the mem-
ory eﬀects of the dynamics are embedded into the noise
correlations, while Eq. (1) is local in time. The physical,
reduced density operator ρ(t) is obtained as an expecta-
tion value over a large number of noise realisations, i.e.,

[HS(t), ρZ ] +

ξ(t)[σz, ρZ ] +

i
¯h

ρ(t) = E [ρZ (t)] ,

(2)

In the following, we consider resonant, periodic driving of
the system, which only changes the system Hamiltonian
HS → HS(t):

HS(t) = H0 + HD(t) = − ¯hω

σx + λ0 sin(ω t) σz ,

(3)

as the SLN treats the system-bath interaction exactly.
The driving couples to the same system degree of free-

2

dom as the bath and therefore acts as an additional con-
tribution to the reservoir. Therefore, the driving is in
essence reservoir engineering.

The non-equilibrium thermodynamics of this system
[33]. The heat ﬂux

has recently been studied in Ref.
between the system and environment is given by

jQ(t) = −ω E [ξ(t)(cid:104)σy(t)(cid:105)] ,

(4)
where the (cid:104)·(cid:105) denote the quantum mechanical average.
The derivation of Eq. (4) is based on the deﬁnition of
work via the power operator, as introduced in Ref. [13].
In the Heisenberg picture, the ﬁrst law of thermodynam-
ics in the Hilbert space of the composite system gives
the heat ﬂow (for details see Ref. [33]). Throughout this
paper, we use natural units where ω = 1, ¯h = 1 and
kB = 1.

Measure of Non-Markovianity. There are several dif-
ferent approaches to quantify the information backﬂow in
non-Markovian dynamics [2, 4, 6–8]. The BLP measure
of Ref.
[6] monitors the dynamics of distinguishability
between two initial preparations. In the Markovian case,
the open system dynamics monotonically decreases the
distinguishability which eventually vanishes for dynam-
ics with a unique steady state (cf. Fig. 1). To quan-
tify the distinguishability, the BLP measure employs the
trace distance D as

D(ρ1, ρ2) =

Tr|ρ1 − ρ2|

1
2

(5)

The information ﬂow ∆ is deﬁned as the change of the
trace distance in time, and is given by

∆(t, ρ1(0), ρ2(0)) =

d
dt

D(ρ1, ρ2) .

(6)

Only time intervals where the trace distance increases,
contribute to the BLP measure:

(cid:90)

N (Φ) = max

ρ1,ρ2

∆>0

dt∆(t, ρ1, ρ2).

(7)

This measure also includes an optimization over all pos-
sible input states. It is known that for a TLS, the pair of
states that maximises the BLP measure is pure and lo-
cated on the opposite sides of the Bloch sphere [34]. The
optimal pair depends on the propagation time. In the fol-
lowing we concentrate on ∆ (cf. Eq. (6)) instead of the
full BLP measure of Eq. (7). While avoiding the numer-
ically demanding optimization, this also provides more
insight into the dynamics of information backﬂow and
how it can be controlled by means of an external drive.
Given that the orientation of the system is not completely
random, as the bath couples to σz and therefore distin-
guishes this basis, we will examine the behaviour of the
trace distance of the plus and minus eigenstates of the
Pauli matrices. In other words, for each Pauli matrix we
choose its pair of eigenvectors as the initial states, and
then compute their respective dynamics and the corre-
sponding information ﬂow ∆.

FIG. 2: (Color online) Information ﬂow as measured by the
quantity ∆ (cf. Eq. (6)) during propagation time. Positive
values of ∆ (data above the dashed horizontal black line) cor-
respond to information backﬂow from the bath to the system.
The diﬀerent curves correspond to diﬀerent initial prepara-
tions of the system, where the two states are the eigenstates of
each spin operator (blue dash-dotted line for σx, red dashed
line for σy, and yellow solid line for σz). All data are for
γ = 0.05 and β = 5. The upper panel (a) shows the dynamics
of the system without an external drive, while in the lower
panel (b) the system is driven periodically with a resonant
drive of amplitude λ0 = 1.

FIG. 3: (Color online) Heat ﬂux of Eq. (4) for diﬀerent initial
preparations of the system, where the upper panels (a) and
(c) are for the two eigenstates of σz, and (b) and (d) are for
the two eigenstates of σx (red solid lines are for the + spin
eigenstates and blue dashed lines for the − states). All data
are for γ = 0.05 and β = 5. Panels (a) and (b) are for the
undriven case, and panels (c) and (d) for the same drive as in
Fig. 2. Negative values of jQ(t) correspond to a heat ﬂux from
the system into the environment. Grey shaded areas indicate
time windows of information backﬂow for the corresponding
trace distance, as shown in Fig. 2.

Information Backﬂow.

In Fig. 2 we plot the time evo-
lution of the information ﬂow for diﬀerent initial prepara-
tions of the driven and undriven cases. The upper panel
displays the case without an external drive.
It can be
seen that except for the case where the initial preparation
corresponds to the eigenstates of the bare Hamiltonian,
σx, there are time windows during the relaxation where
there are positive values of ∆, corresponding to back-
ﬂow of information from the bath to the system. This
ﬁgure shows clearly that the dynamics of the system is
non-Markovian in the sense of the BLP measure. The
lower panel of Fig. 2 shows data for the same parame-
ter set, but with periodic, resonant driving, with driving
amplitude λ0 = 1. The drive has a clear inﬂuence on
the memory eﬀects. It reduces the backﬂow of informa-
tion seen in the upper panel for eigenstates of σy and σz,
but now there is also information backﬂow for the initial
preparation in eigenstates of σx.

Heat ﬂow. Next we consider the heat ﬂux between the
system and the reservoir, as deﬁned in Eq. (4). In this
setting, the heat ﬂux does not neccessarily ﬂow unidi-
rectionally from the system to the environment but heat
can also return into the system (see, e.g., [33]). Most
importantly, the results in Fig. 3 show that there does
not have to be any correlation between heat and infor-
mation backﬂow for either the driven or undriven cases.
Even for initial pairs in the driven case, where both infor-
mation and heat ﬂow back during the propagation, this
does not happen simultaneously. While the dynamics is

non-Markovian (i.e. there are initial pairs which show in-
formation backﬂow) and there is heat back ﬂow into the
system for certain (other) initial preparations as in [35],
we do not ﬁnd any correlations between heat ﬂux and
information backﬂow for the same pair of initial states.
Non-Markovianity as a Resource. The information
backﬂow shown in Fig. 2 (and for a wider range of pa-
rameters in Fig. 4) is quantitatively small, in particular
in relation to the information lost before the information
ﬂow changes direction. To use non-Markovianity as a
resource, a deeper understanding of how loss and gain
of distinguishability are inﬂuenced by the parameters of
the system and the possibilities to change this with ad-
ditional driving is required. To quantify the information
exchange, we deﬁne the quantity

I∆(t) = D(ρ1(t), ρ2(t)) − D(ρ1(0), ρ2(0)),

(8)

which measures the loss of information (diﬀerence be-
tween the trace distances) after time t from the begin-
ning of the dynamics. We note that in the present case
D(ρ1(0), ρ2(0)) = 1 as we always start from orthogonal
eigenstates.

Figure 4 shows the information loss that occurred be-
fore the distinguishability increased for the ﬁrst time for
a range of temperatures and coupling strengths. If there
is no information backﬂow (as for all undriven cases with
initial preparations of eigenstates for σx), the lower part
of each subﬁgure, respectively of Fig. 4 shows the infor-
mation loss during the full propagation time (2π). With
decreasing bath temperature, i.e., when the dynamics be-

control techniques to tackle this question in its full gen-
erality.

FIG. 4: (Color online) Information lost and gained during the
propagation for diﬀerent values of the inverse temperature β
(a) and the coupling strength γ (b), with and without driving.
The negative values of I∆(t) correspond to the information
lost before the ﬁrst backﬂow event occurs, while the positive
bars quantify the amount of information ﬂowing back (if any)
for the ﬁrst time. The colors in the bars correspond to trace
distances calculated between the two eigenstates of undriven
states σx (dark blue), σy (blue), and σz (light blue), and
driven eigenstates σx (green), σy (orange), and σz (yellow).
Note the diﬀerent scales on the vertical axes for loss and gain.

comes more non-Markovian, the overall information loss
decreases and the subsequent partial information regain
increases. For increasing coupling constant the picture is
more complicated, since both the backﬂow of information
and the loss increase. Adding an external drive alters the
general picture. While the information backﬂow for the
σz initial eigenstates is suppressed, an increase in the dis-
tinguishability of the σx initial eigenstates occurs. There
might be experimental situations where storing the infor-
mation in the eigenstates of the bare system Hamiltonian
is more favourable. Our results show that tailored driv-
ing oﬀers the possibility to enhance non-Markovianity,
and hence the backﬂow of information, in the desired di-
rection. The ﬁrst instance where the information ﬂow
is reversed (not shown), depends only very weakly on β
and γ, but changes considerably when driving is present
as can for example be seen for the set of parameters in
Fig. 2.

Summary. We have studied for the ﬁrst time the in-
formation theoretic concept of non-Markovianity in a
paradigmatic condensed matter system, i.e.
the exact
spin-boson model, ﬁnding that backﬂow of information
does occur in the system. Our results show that there
is generally no connection between information exchange
and heatﬂow between the system and the bath either for
the undriven or driven cases. We have also examined the
inﬂuence of temperature and coupling strength on infor-
mation loss and regain in the model. Finally, we have
provided insight in how the information backﬂow can be
inﬂuenced by driving. Our results thus pave the way to
