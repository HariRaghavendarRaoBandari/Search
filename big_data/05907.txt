Threshold of auroral intensiﬁcation reduced by electron precipitation eﬀect

It has been known that discrete aurora suddenly intensiﬁes and deforms from an arc-like to a
variety of wavy/vortex structures, especially during a substorm period. The instability of Alfv´en
waves reﬂected from the ionosphere has been analyzed in order to comprehend the ignition process of
auroral intensiﬁcation. It was presented that the prime key is an enhancement of plasma convection,
and the convection electric ﬁeld has a threshold. This study examined eﬀects of auroral electron
precipitation, causing the ionization of neutral atmosphere, on the linear instability of Alfv´en waves.
It was found that the threshold of convection electric ﬁelds is signiﬁcantly reduced by increasing
the ionization rate, the realistic range of which could be estimated from observed electron energy
spectra.

INTRODUCTION

Auroral

intensiﬁcation has been vigorously studied
with narrow ﬁeld of view or high resolution optical mea-
surements [e.g., Donovan et al., 2007; Mende et al., 2009].
It is known that the time scale of intensiﬁcation is 1–2
min, and fading of auroral arcs appears just before the
onset. Furthermore, vortex street structures called as
”beads” emerged on the auroral arc, probably due to a
development of strong ﬂow shears.

It has been considered that, on the basis of the above
facts, shear Alfv´en waves propagating along the mag-
netic ﬁeld line are involved in auroral intensiﬁcation.
Three-dimensional simulations that treated ampliﬁcation
of shear Alfv´en waves, driven by a coupling between
the ionospheric and magnetospheric plasmas with ﬁeld-
aligned currents, were performed [Jia and Streltsov, 2014;
Hiraki, 2015a, b]. Hiraki [2015b] presented that a thresh-
old exists for the instability of Alfv´en waves due to an
enhancement of plasma convection; the threshold electric
ﬁeld was ≈ 25 mV/m in their situation. These studies
did not explicitly treat the electron acceleration by ﬁeld-
aligned electric ﬁelds and the ionization of neutral atmo-
sphere, which are the essence of discrete auroras. They
assumed that the upward ﬁeld-aligned current carried by
waves is identical to the auroral luminosity.

Measurements of electron density by EISCAT radar
[Kirkwood et al., 1990; Olsson et al., 1996] and of par-
ticles by DMSP and FAST satellites [Yago et al., 2005;
Mende et al., 2003] revealed that the ﬁeld-aligned electric
ﬁeld originates from inverted-V type potential drops at
a height of ≈ 1000 km or inertial Alfv´en waves excited
at ≈ 6000 km. Energies of electrons accelerated by each
electric ﬁeld are 2–10 keV or < 1 keV, respectively. Al-
though previous simulations treated inertial Alfv´en waves
[Lysak and Song, 2008; Jia and Streltsov, 2014], evolu-

tion of waves with a realistic ﬁeld-aligned electric ﬁeld is
not still resolved.

This study examined the other topic, i.e., the eﬀect of
ionization by inverted-V type non-thermal electrons on
the instability of shear Alfv´en waves. These electrons
with an energy of 2–10 keV strongly increase the con-
ductivities in a height of 100–120 km where horizontal
currents that can couple with shear Alfv´en waves maxi-
mize [Fang et al., 2008].

The ionization rate by the non-thermal electrons was
formulated as qj(cid:107), q: electron yielding coeﬃcient, j(cid:107):
ﬁeld-aligned current by Alfv´en waves [Lysak and Song,
2002]. However, its eﬀect on the growth of shear Alfv´en
waves was not clariﬁed. This study analyzed the linear
instability of shear Alfv´en waves, including eﬀects of ion-
ization, in the magnetosphere-ionosphere (M-I) coupling
system. We especially focused on the possibility that
the threshold ﬁeld value (≈ 25 mV/m) presented in our
previous study is reduced to be a popular level in obser-
vations, e.g., 10–20 mV/m [Provan et al., 2004; Bristow
and Jensen, 2007].

II. MODEL DESCRIPTION

The target region of our analysis is a magnetic ﬂux
tube that involves an auroral arc with a width of ≈ 10
km. Shear Alfv´en waves, propagating along the magnetic
ﬁeld right above the arc, ﬂow the ﬁeld-aligned current j(cid:107)
into the ionosphere. It connects with horizontal currents
caused by plasma convection. A situation is considered
where the coupling of currents destabilizes shear Alfv´en
waves, implying the initial brightening of aurora.

The ﬁeld line position s is deﬁned as s = 0 at the iono-
sphere and s = l at the magnetic equator. We consider
a latitude of 70◦ in the southern hemisphere, with the
dipole L value of ≈ 8.5 and l ≈ 7 × 104 km. We take
coordinates x(s) and y(s) orthogonal to each s: x points
southward (poleward) and y points eastward at s = 0.
We set a local ﬂux tube, e.g., a square of (l⊥ × l⊥) at

s = 0 and a rectangle of (≈ 3300 km × ≈ 1700 km) at
s = l using l⊥ ≈ 70 km and dipole metrics; see Hiraki
and Watanabe [2011] for details.

The dipole magnetic ﬁeld is written as B0. The system
has a convective electric ﬁeld E0 that is applied poleward
((cid:107) x) and is uniform in every x-y planes. With perturbed
electric and magnetic ﬁelds of E1 = −B0∇⊥φ and B1 =
∇⊥ψ × B0, linearized equations for shear Alfv´en waves
are expressed as

(1)

∂tω + v0 · ∇⊥ω = v2
∂tψ + v0 · ∇⊥ψ = − 1
B0

A∂sj(cid:107)

∂sB0φ.

(2)
The domain of deﬁnition is 0 < s ≤ l. Here, ω = ∇2⊥φ
stands for vorticity, j(cid:107) = −∇2⊥ψ ﬁeld-aligned current,
v0 = E0 × B0/B2
0 the convection speed, and vA the
Alfv´en velocity. The same as Hiraki [2015b], vA is set
to be constant as ≈ 1.5 × 103 km/s along the ﬁeld line.
0 1/vA(s)ds ≈ 47

The Alfv´en transit time is thus τA =(cid:82) l

s.

By integrating the continuity equations of ions and

electrons, the linearized equations
∂tne + v0 · ∇⊥ne = qj(cid:107) − Rne
(3)
−n0µP∇2⊥φ + (µPE0 − v0) · ∇⊥ne = D∇2⊥ne − j(cid:107)(4)
are obtained for plasma motion at the ionosphere s = 0.
Here, ne stands for electron density, n0 its ambient com-
ponent, µP Pedersen mobility, R the recombination coef-
ﬁcient, and D the diﬀusion coeﬃcient. The Hall mobility
appearing in Eqs. (3) and (4) is normalized to be unity.
These equations couple with Eqs. (1) and (2) of shear
Alfv´en waves through ﬁeld-aligned current j(cid:107). The elec-
tron yielding rate was set to be q = 1 in Hiraki [2015b] by
assuming continuity of the thermal electron ﬂux. In this
study, q ≥ 1 is given on the supposition that ionization of
neutral particles occurs due to the non-thermal electron
precipitation.
In order to solve Eqs. (1)–(4), ﬁeld variables φ, ψ, and
ne are expanded such as φ(x, s) = ˜φ(s)expi(k⊥·x−Ωt) with
complex frequency Ω and perpendicular wave number
k⊥. The boundary condition at the magnetic equator
is set to be ∂sφ = 0, or ψ = 0 (zero current), and shapes
of eigenfunctions ˜φ and ˜ψ at s = 0–l are calculated. We
can redeﬁne the frequency Ω − v0 · k⊥ in the frame of
v0 to be Ω without loss of generality. From Eqs. (3) and
(4), we get the dispersion relation as

(cid:16)

1 − q

σ − iDk2⊥
Ω + iR

(cid:17) ˜ψ + α ˜φ = 0.

(5)
Here, two parameters σ = (µPE0 − v0) · k⊥ and α =
µPn0 are introduced. The former means the convec-
tive drift frequency, while the latter corresponds to the
Pedersen/Alfv´en impedance ratio ΣP/ΣA.
The ionospheric parameters used for the solution of Eq.
(5) are set to be µP/µH = 0.5, α = 5, R = 2 × 10−3 s−1,
and D = 4 × 105 m2/s. It is also noted that the ambient

density and magnetic ﬁeld are set to be n0 ≈ 3.8 × 104
cm−3 and B0 ≈ 5 × 10−5 T.

III. RESULTS

The simplest case is that there are an auroral arc in
the ionosphere and Alfv´en waves right above it. The
kx = 1 mode is distinguished in the arc if its spatial scale
is approximated to the Gaussian distribution; hereafter,
wave number is normalized by 2π/l⊥. The arc without
east-westward structures, i.e., ky = 0, is considered for
simplicity. Figure 1 shows the linear growth rates γ ≡
Im(Ω)τA/π of (kx (cid:54)= 0, ky = 0) modes that were obtained
by solving Eqs. (1), (2), and (5) under the conditions in

We investigate how the critical ﬁeld for this (2, 0) mode
responds when q (≥ 1) is changed. Figure 2 shows a
diagram of γ(2, 0) in (E0, q) space: open circle stands
for the case of γ(2, 0) > 0, while cross for the case of
γ(2, 0) < 0. It is clearly found that the critical value of
E0 for γ(2, 0) > 0 can be reduced if q is increased. Note
that the term proportional to qσ ∼ qE0 appears in the
left-hand side of Eq. (5) in case of D = 0. It means that
a mode is unstable for any set of q and E0 that satisﬁes
qE0 = const; the diﬀusion term (D) slightly changes the
relation to a ﬁtting function qE1.1
0 = const for the open
circle-cross boundary in Fig. 2. Because the q value has
an upper limit in the real situation just before a faint
arc starts to intensify, the critical E0 necessarily has a
lower limit. We will discuss in Sec. IV on the way to
estimate the realistic range of q values and the reason
why we remove the possibility of higher modes kx ≥ 3.
At the end of this section, we describe the character-
istics of eigenmodes in the moderate case of electric ﬁeld
E0 = 10 mV/m. Figure 3 shows the responses of real
frequency Re(Ω), growth rate Im(Ω), and eigenfunction
Re( ˜φ) of the (2, 0) mode to a change in q. The gradi-
ent of Re(Ω)(kx) steepens in the lower kx side, owing
to qσ ∼ qkx in Eq. (5). Related to this change as q
increases, a sharp peak in γ appears and moves to the
lower kx side. A high γ in the case of high q is supported
by the fact that the amplitude of eigenfunction Re( ˜φ) at
s = 0 increases.

IV. DISCUSSION

Let us ﬁrst mention why the (kx, ky) = (2, 0) mode is
chosen when the critical ﬁeld Ecr for auroral intensiﬁca-
tion is proposed at the part of Fig. 2. As pointed in Secs.
I and III, the critical value Ecr ≈ 45 mV/m for the (1, 0)
mode in case of q = 1 is likely to be much higher than
the typical value in observations [Bristow and Jensen,
2007]. The growth rate increases with the mode number,
and the critical ﬁeld for (8, 0) is Ecr ≈ 10 mV/m (Fig.
1). However, we should start a speculation that (2, 0),
(3, 0), . . . modes are produced through successive splits
of an arc. It may require a very long time for the (8, 0)
mode to emerge to cause an instability involving Alfv´en
waves. We suppose that an arc with a width of larc (≈ 10
km), splitting into two arcs, requires to move at least a
distance of larc by a drift in the critical ﬁeld v0,cr ∝ Ecr.
Producing N -arcs requires a distance of (N − 1)larc. The
condition for this (N − 1)-splitting is that the time scale
∆τ is shorter than the time scale τA representing ﬁeld
changes. This relation is expressed as

(N − 1)larc

v0,cr

∆τ =

< τA.

(6)
Here, τA ≈ 47 s and we determined Ecr ≈ 23 and 17
mV/m (v0,cr ≈ 0.46 and 0.34 km/s) for (2, 0) and (3, 0)
modes. Substituting these values into Eq. (6), we calcu-
lated ∆τ ≈ 21 and 58 s, respectively, and the latter does

rate γ, and (c) eigenfunctions Re( ˜φ) on the electron yielding
rate q for (kx, ky) = (2, 0) mode along with E0 = 10 mV/m.

Sec. II. Here, the electron yielding rate being q = 1, the
response of γ to changes in the poleward electric ﬁeld E0
was found. We readily found the value of the critical ﬁeld
for γ(1, 0) > 0 to be ≈ 45 mV/m.

Hiraki [2015b] demonstrated that an arc quickly splits
into two arcs due to a density perturbation produced
by the poleward Pedersen current. For the higher mode
(2, 0), we also evaluated the critical ﬁeld for γ(2, 0) > 0 to
be ≈ 23 mV/m (Fig. 1). It is, however, noted that a lower
electric ﬁeld, e.g. 10 mV/m, just before auroral intensi-
ﬁcation was estimated with SuperDARN radars [Provan
et al., 2004].

to remove the possibility of the instability with higher
modes kx ≥ 3. It is, however, noted that the (3, 0) mode
can be preferable rather than the (2, 0) mode in the other
speciﬁc case of Eq. (6) with a stretched magnetic ﬁeld.

For motivations of future observations of electron en-
ergy spectrum just before auroral intensiﬁcation, we illus-
trated the way to estimate a realistic q value. Equating
it,

q = η


th

,

(7)

which meets q ≥ 1. Here,  stands for injected electron
energy (eV), th the mean energy loss per ion pair produc-
tion, and η the ratio of the injected (non-thermal) elec-
tron ﬂux to the thermal electron ﬂux carrying Alfv´enic
j(cid:107). The typical value of th was estimated to be 35 eV
[Fang et al., 2008; and references therein]. Generally,
η < 1 since we assumed the ionization term in Eq. (3) as
a product qj(cid:107) of q and j(cid:107) proportional to the thermal elec-
tron ﬂux. Referring to the precipitating electron model
by Fang et al. [2008], we pick energies of  = 5 or 10 keV
that produce peaks in the ionization rate at our target re-
gion of 100–120 km. For these energies, /th ≈ 140 and
≈ 280, respectively. We assume measured energy distri-
butions with EISCAT radars [Kirkwood et al., 1990; Ols-
son et al., 1996] and DMSP satellite [Yago et al., 2005]
as a 1 keV Maxwellian distribution, and roughly esti-
mate the energy ratio η to be up to ≈ 10−2. In this case,
q ≈ 1.4 and 2.8 are obtained for 5 and 10 keV electrons,
respectively.

The above estimation of q values is supported by the
assumption that an inverted-V potential right above the
arc keeps a robust energy spectrum including accelerated
electrons. However, it has a possibility to change the q
value (even a slight change) if the inertial Alfv´en wave
supplies < 1 keV accelerated electrons; here, we refer to
the stopping height of 1 keV electrons being ≈ 100 km
[Fang et al., 2008]. Although we did not consider any

4

dependence of q on j(cid:107), q could correlate with j(cid:107) of shear
Alfv´en waves through E(cid:107) of inertial Alfv´en waves. The
linear form of qj(cid:107) may be corrected in our future studies
that treat both waves.

Our prime suggestion for future observations is that
an increase in the ionization rate by non-thermal elec-
trons can reduce the threshold ﬁeld, to a great extent, of
instabilities of Alfv´en waves related to auroral intensiﬁca-
tion. However, compared to the average energy compo-
nent carrying j(cid:107), the amount of the non-thermal compo-
nent is limited. The q value has an upper limit, and thus
Ecr value has a lower limit. SuperDARN radar observa-
tions revealed that the convection speed in the vicinity
of arcs exceeds ≈ 400 m/s over ≈ 30 min before onsets
of auroral intensiﬁcation [Bristow and Jensen, 2007]; the
time scale (> τA) is reasonable for shear Alfv´en waves to
be ampliﬁed [see Hiraki, 2015b]. With the magnetic ﬁeld
of B0 ≈ 5× 10−5 T, the speed corresponds to the electric
ﬁeld of E0 ≈ 20 mV/m. The rate q = 3–4 is suﬃcient for
instabilities of the waves, if this ﬁeld value is regarded as
the threshold. However, we need the higher rate q = 5–6,
if future precise and statistical observations will present
a lower value, e.g., min Ecr ≈ 10 mV/m. We urge fasci-
nating ﬁeld/particle observations to determine both the
lower limit of threshold ﬁelds and the upper limit of q
values.

V. CONCLUSION

This study investigated changes in the threshold elec-
tric ﬁeld Ecr of plasma convection, causing a linear insta-
bility of Alfv´en waves, due to the ionization (q) by pre-
cipitating auroral electrons. We clariﬁed that the value
of Ecr is reduced in the cases of q > 1. A realistic value of
q ≈ 3, suﬃcient for a fast growth of waves, was obtained
from observed electron energy spectra. In future, our re-
sults motivate the thorough search for the q value with
electron energy spectra at auroral breakup and precise
measurements of convection electric ﬁelds by radars.
