Maximal linear groups induced on the

Frattini quotient of a p-group

John Bamberg, S. P. Glasby, Luke Morgan and Alice C. Niemeyer

Abstract. Let p > 3 be a prime. For each maximal subgroup H 6 GL(d, p) with
|H| = pO(d2), we construct a d-generator ﬁnite p-group G with the property that Aut(G)
induces H on the Frattini quotient G/Φ(G) and |G| = pO(d4). A signiﬁcant feature of
this construction is that |G| is very small compared to |H|, shedding new light upon a
celebrated result of Bryant and Kov´acs. The groups G that we exhibit have exponent p,
and of all such groups G with the desired action of H on G/Φ(G), the construction yields
groups with smallest nilpotency class, and in most cases, the smallest order.

1. Introduction

The number of groups of prime power order is dauntingly large: Higman and Sims [14,
24] showed that there are as many as p2m3(1+O(m−1/3))/27 groups of order pm. This suggests
that properties of p-groups should be investigated statistically. Given a property, one may
ask: What is the range of possibilities? What is the frequency distribution? What are the
mean and variance?

Some questions concerning ‘ranges’ were considered in the 1970’s. For example, one
may ask which groups can arise as the group induced by the automorphism group Aut(G)
acting on G/Z(G), for a p-group G. Heineken and Liebeck [10] showed that the range is
as large as possible, namely for any ﬁnite group H and any prime p > 2, there exists a
p-group G of nilpotency class 2, and exponent p2 such that Aut(G) induces H on G/Z(G).
Later this result was generalised to all primes, see [16, 27]. The group G constructed in [10]

is a d-generator p-group where d = |H|(cid:0)k+2

reduce the number of generators of G to d = |H| when H is a sporadic simple group. These
examples have |G| > p|H| so it is unclear whether one sees such wild behaviour in practical
examples, or whether |G| is always huge compared to |H|. Is wildness of theoretical interest
only?

A result addressing the frequency is due to Helleloid and Martin. They show in [12,
Theorem 3] that the group A(G) induced on G/Φ(G) by the automorphism group of some
d-generator p-group G, is ‘almost always’ the trivial subgroup of GL(d, p). In light of this
result, a natural question about ranges is: Which subgroups H 6 GL(d, p) are conjugate1
to A(G), for some d-generator p-group G? Thus groups for which A(G) is non-trivial are
rare. However, Bryant and Kov´acs [4] prove a striking result: given H 6 GL(d, p) where
d > 1, there exists a d-generator p-group G such that Aut(G) induces on G/Φ(G) the linear
group H. An alternative proof of this celebrated result is given in [17, Chapter VIII, §13].
Whilst the methods of the proof of [4, Theorem 1] are natural, utilising the Lie ring
associated to a p-group, the conclusion is not constructive:
it is an existence result not
bounding |G|, the nilpotency class of G, nor the exponent of G.

Inspired by the above results, given H 6 GL(d, p), we ask whether it is possible to
ﬁnd relatively small groups G (compared to |H|) satisfying A(G) = H? For certain H, we
construct a d-generator ﬁnite p-group G with the property that A(G) = H and |G| = pO(d4).

In particular, we have d = O(qlogp |H|). Thus, our construction shows that ‘small’ p-

groups G with A(G) = H do in fact occur. Our methods for constructing G from H
involve some rather interesting representation theory, our constructions are geometric, and
we believe, also very natural. We hope that they contribute to a deeper understanding
of automorphism groups of p-groups and their construction, as even the very eﬃcient
algorithms [6] to compute Aut(G) struggle when G is large, for example, when G is one of
the groups we construct in Table 6.1. For more information on automorphism groups of
p-groups, we refer the reader to the survey of Helleloid [11].

To state our main result we require the following deﬁnition. The lower (exponent-)p
(central) series 2 for a group X is deﬁned inductively by X0 = X, Xk = [X, Xk−1]X p
k−1 for
k > 1. The smallest integer n for which Xn = {1} is called the lower p-length of X, and
we write np(X) = n. If X is a group of exponent p, the lower p-length of X is equal to the
nilpotency class of X (or class for short).

Theorem 1. Let p > 3 be a prime, and let d > 1 be an integer. Suppose H is a

maximal subgroup of GL(d, p), where SL(d, p) 66 H. Then one of the following holds:

(i) there exists a d-generator p-group G such that Aut(G) induces H on the Frattini

quotient G/Φ(G), |G| 6 pd4/2, and Gp = G4 = {1}, or

(ii) H normalizes a subgroup which is absolutely irreducible and either quasisimple or a

symplectic type r-group.

For more information about the nilpotency class, order, and structure of G, see Table 6.1.

1.1. Strategy and outline of the paper. We address the problem: given H 6
GL(d, p) ﬁnd G such that A(G) = H. To ensure that G is interesting, we choose H
to be a maximal subgroup of GL(d, p), and insist that |G| is minimal subject to having

1Later we write ‘equal to’ rather than ‘conjugate to’, as changing basis for G/Φ(G) alters A(G) by an

arbitrary inner automorphism of GL(d, p).

2Properties of this series are given in Huppert and Blackburn [18, 16, Chapter VIII]. However, their

deﬁnition diﬀers from ours as it starts with X1 = X.

exponent p. To avoid trivialities, we assume that p > 2 (as 2-groups of exponents 2 are
elementary abelian). In Section 4 we summarise the maximal subgroups of GL(d, p) that
we consider and explain the notation in Columns 1-4 of Table 6.1.

Our strategy for constructing G is to examine the freest d-generator group B of expo-
nent p. The quotient Γn = B/Bn (the quotient of B by the nth term of its lower central
series) is the universal p-group of exponent p and class n. Our results depend critically
on a practical description of Γn. In §2 we describe Γn using a new data structure which
we call Lie n-tuples. The problem of constructing our desired group G is reduced in §4
to determining the H-submodule structure of a certain Lie power LnV of the natural H-
module V , see Theorem 2.1. In §3 we consider the irreducible submodules of Lie powers,
keeping the prerequisites to a minimum. Aschbacher’s classes Ci of maximal subgroups H
of GL(d, p) are listed in §4 before we determine class-by-class the H-submodule structure
of LnV in §5. The proof of Theorem 1 appears in §6, and we conclude in §7 with some
open questions and directions for future research.

Notation. Throughout the paper V will denote a vector space of dimension d over a
(possibly inﬁnite) ﬁeld F. The precedence of the operators3 An, Sn, T n is greater than ⊗
which is greater than ⊕. For example, AnU ⊗ V ⊕ W means ((AnU) ⊗ V ) ⊕ W .

2. Universal groups of exponent p

Given a maximal subgroup H 6 GL(d, p), we seek a d-generator p-group G such that
A(G) = H. In some sense G is a ‘non-linear representation’ of H. We construct G as
a quotient of a certain universal group Γn of class n and exponent p. The purpose of
this section is to give a precise description of Γn so that we can reduce the problem of
constructing G to problems regarding the module structure of certain explicitly described
H-modules. The group H acts on V = Fd
p = G/G1 where G1 = Φ(G) is the Frattini
subgroup of G. We will see that H induces a well deﬁned action on all sections Gi−1/Gi
of G. However, the groups we consider have class n 6 4, and in this case H is a subgroup
(not just a quotient group) of Aut(G) by Theorem 2.4(v). Thus H is a subgroup of Aut(G)
and not Out(G).

Higman describes in [13] how to associate a graded Lie ring L(Ni) to a normal series
i=1 Ni = {1} hold. The
Ni/Ni+1 are abelian as [Ni, Ni] 6 N2i 6 Ni+1. We view the Ni/Ni+1 as additive groups,
i=1 Ni/Ni+1. The following multiplication rule
(giNi)(gjNj) = [gi, gj]Ni+j turns L(Ni) into a graded Lie ring. The Hall-Witt identity for
G (see [26]) gives rise to the Jacobi identity for L(Ni). The sections Ni/Ni+1 are called
homogenous components of the Lie ring.

Let F be the free group of rank d, and let B = B(d, p) = F/F p be the relatively free
Burnside group of rank d and exponent p. Both the lower central series4 of F (taking Ni =

It turns out that Ln is a free abelian group, and Ln is a vector space over the prime

of Ln. Indeed,

Because of this connection we will write L(V ) instead of L, and LnV instead of Ln. We
now describe this concrete construction of L(V ) from T (V ) (for arbitrary ﬁelds F).

Recall that H is a given maximal subgroup of GL(V ) and we seek to construct a p-
group G of minimal class satisfying A(G) = H. The group Γn := B/Bn is a universal
p-group in that every d-generator p-group G of class n and exponent p is a quotient group
i=1 fp(d, i),

of Γn. It follows from the above remarks that the order of Γn is pm where m =Pn
and for p > n we have m =Pn

A vital tool for constructing a group G with minimal nilpotency class n is to ﬁnd the
smallest dimensional (non-zero) quotient H-module of LnV where V = Fd
p is the natural
H-module, see the proof of Theorem 1 in §6 for further details. The following theorem
converts our group theoretic problem to a representation theoretic one. The relevant Lie
representation theory needed for this paper is described in §3 below.

i=1 f (d, i). We use (2) and (3) to evaluate m.

Theorem 2.1. Let B = B(d, p) be the d-generator Burnside group of odd exponent p.
If Bn 6 X < Bn−1 and G = B/X, then A(G) = K where K = NGL(d,p)(X/Bn), i.e., the
group A(G) of automorphisms induced by Aut(G) on G/Φ(G) is K. Also np(G) = n.

Proof. First, Bn 6 X < Bn−1 implies np(G) = n as Gn−1 = Bn−1/X is non-trivial.
Second, the proof relies on the fact that A(B) ∼= GL(d, p) induces a well-deﬁned action on
the elementary abelian p-groups Bn−1/Bn, see [17, Chapter VIII, Lemma 13.3] and [12,
§2.2]. For the remainder of the proof, see [12, Theorem 13].
(cid:3)

Lemma 2.2. Let p a prime and let n, d > 1 be integers. There exists a ﬁnite p-group Γn
such that every d-generator p-group G of class n and exponent p is an epimorphic image
of Γn. Moreover, if p > n and 1 6 k 6 n, we have

|γk(Γn)/γk+1(Γn)| = pf (d,k) where f (d, k) =

µ(i)d

Proof. Let F be the free group on d-generators and let B = F/F p be the d-generator
Burnside group of exponent p. Set Γn = B/Bn. As G is d-generated and has exponent p,
it is a quotient group of B. Thus there is a surjective map τ : B → G. Moreover, since G
has class n, we have Bn 6 ker(τ ). Thus τ induces a surjective map τ ∗ : Γn → G.

It remains to bound |Γn|. Suppose that p > n and 1 6 k 6 n. Since τ (Bk) = Gk,
we see that τ (and τ ∗) induce homomorphisms Bk−1/Bk → Gk−1/Gk for all k. By Witt
∼= γk(Γn)/γk+1(Γn)
[30, p. 209, (6p)] the dimension of Bk−1/Bk is fp(d, k), and Bk−1/Bk
since (Γn)k = γk+1(Γn). However, as remarked above, it follows from the formula (3) that
fp(d, k) = f (d, k) for p > n. This completes the proof.
(cid:3)

It is important, by Theorem 2.1, to study the induced representation of GL(d, p) on the
section Bn−1/Bn. We begin with a description of Γn := B/Bn itself. The elements of Γn
can be identiﬁed with n-tuples (v1, . . . , vn) of vectors in the Cartesian product L1 ×· · ·×Ln.
We call (v1, . . . , vn) a Lie n-tuple, as each vi lies in the Lie power LiV where V = Fd
p. The
question arises: How do we multiply two n-tuples of vectors to obtain another n-tuple of
vectors? This is a non-standard approach for computing with p-groups. The standard data
structure used for representing and computing with p-groups is a power-conjugate, or power

commutator presentation, abbreviated pc-presentation, see [15, §8.1]. The pc-presentation
and Lie n-tuple data structures are diﬀerent, see Remark 2.6.

Construction 2.3 (Lie n-tuples). We now construct a group Γn(V ) and we assume

that char(F) 6∈ {2, . . . , n}, so that Γn(V ) has class n, see Theorem 2.4(iv).

Proof. (i)–(iii) The associative law (gng′

n) holds for n = 1 because
(v1 + v′
1 ), and it holds for n = 2 because [ , ] is biadditive. Verifying
associativity for n = 3, 4 involves complicated (though technically simple) calculations.
For this reason we delegated the task to a Magma [3] computer program whose source
can be found at [9]. The identity element is easily seen to be the all zeroes vector, written
1 = (0, . . . , 0), and the inverse of gn is g−1
n = (−v1, . . . , −vn). This follows because [v, 0] =
[0, v] = [v, −v] = 0. Hence Γn(V ) is a group for n 6 4 and all vector spaces V = Fd.

Properties of these groups depend on the characteristic of the ﬁeld F. For example,
it is easy to see by induction on k that gk
n = (kv1, . . . , kvn) for k ∈ Z. Hence Γn(V ) has
exponent p if char(F) = p > 0, and is torsion-free otherwise. The following commutator
calculations are too long for most humans (when n = 3, 4) and were done by the Magma [3]

deﬁned by (v1, . . . , vn)αg = (v1g, . . . , vng) is easily veriﬁed to be a homomorphism.
In
fact, αg is an automorphism with inverse αg−1. Thus the map α : GL(V ) → Aut(Γn)
with α(g) = αg is a monomorphism. The action of Aut(Γn) on the Frattini quotient
Γn/Φ(Γn) ∼= V induces a homomorphism Aut(Γn) → GL(V ) which by the previous remarks
is surjective. We have now shown that GL(V ) is a subgroup (and a quotient group) of
Aut(Γn). Hence Aut(Γn) splits as Aut(Γn) = K ⋊ GL(d, p) for n 6 4, with K as in the
statement above. In fact, K is a normal p-subgroup of Aut(Γn) by a theorem of Hall. (cid:3)

Remark 2.5. The multiplication rule (7) was found using linear algebra. After enforc-
ing the laws (gg′)g′′ = g(g′g′′) and gp = 1, we had two free variables. Thus the rule (7) is
not unique. It would be desirable to know multiplication rules for n > 4.

Remark 2.6. One may guess that rules (5)–(7) for multiplying Lie n-tuples do no
more than encode a pc-presentation5 for Γn(V ). This turns out not to be the case. For
example, consider a special group Γ2(V ) = G of order p(m
2 ) and exponent p > 2 where
V = (Fp)m. Let G have generators gi, 1 6 i 6 m, and hk,j, 1 6 j < k 6 m, and deﬁne
a pc-presentation for G by gp
j = gjhk,j for 1 6 j < k 6 m. This
pc-presentation gives rise to the symbolic multiplication rule

Indeed when m = 1, every pc-presentation for G (with diﬀerent composition series or
transversals) has the same rule. It is much easier to prove that GL(V ) is a subgroup of
Aut(G) using the more geometric ‘Lie’ rule (5), than using (11). We return to this point
in Remark 5.7.

3. Relevant representation theory

Bryant and Kov´acs proved [4, Theorem 1] by considering regular submodules of a
certain sum of Lie powers [4, Theorem 2]. In this section, we consider the relevant Lie
representation theory for our results. A good introduction to this topic is [19]. As noted
in §2, the action of GL(V ) on V induces an action on the tensor algebra T (V ), and on
L(V ) (which is a subset of T nV containing V , closed under the Lie bracket [ , ]).

Our aim in this section is to describe the GL(V )-modules LiV for 1 6 i 6 4 and to
show that they are irreducible. We note that the representation theory of GL(V ) on T nV
is known when char(F) = 0 (see [7]) and the irreducible GL(V )-modules are described by
the representation theory of the symmetric group Sn of degree n. We require the analogous
results when F is a ﬁnite ﬁeld and char(F) > n, which we have been unable to locate in

The action of g ∈ GL(V ) on the nth tensor power T nV = V ⊗n is

(v1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vn)g = (v1g) ⊗ · · · ⊗ (vng)

where v1, . . . , vn ∈ V ,

and the following action of the symmetric group of degree n commutes with that of GL(V ):

(v1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vn)σ = (v1σ−1) ⊗ · · · ⊗ (vnσ−1)

where v1, . . . , vn ∈ V , and σ ∈ Sn.

Suppose now that char(F) 6∈ {2, . . . , n} so that Sn acts completely reducibly on T nV .

There exist primitive central orthogonal idempotents6 e1, . . . , er ∈ FSn which satisfy

Since the actions of GL(V ) and Sn commute, this is a GL(V )-invariant decomposition
of T nV . The primitive idempotents

give rise to the symmetric and alternating powers SnV and AnV , respectively. For vectors
v1, . . . , vn ∈ V we deﬁne

v1 ⊙ · · · ⊙ vn = n!(v1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vn)e1

and v1 ∧ · · · ∧ vn = n!(v1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vn)e2.

The symmetric and alternating powers are spanned by vectors of the form v1 ⊙ · · · ⊙ vn
and v1 ∧ · · · ∧ vn respectively, and their dimensions are

if char(F) 6= 2.

We now relate LnV for n 6 3, to more familiar modules. We have L1V = V and
L2V = A2V because v1 ∧ v2 = [v1, v2] (see (4)). We warn the reader that [v1, v2, v3] 6=

v1 ∧ v2 ∧ v3, the left hand side term has four summands while the right hand side term has
six summands.

Lemma 3.1. Suppose that char(F) 6= 2, 3. The following hold.

(i) If d > 3, then L3V = X1 ⊕X2 is a sum of irreducible H-modules where H is the group

GL(1, F) ≀ Sd of all monomial matrices, and dim(X1) = 2(cid:0)d

(ii) If d > 1, then L3V is an irreducible GL(V )-module.
(iii) There are isomorphisms A2V ⊗ V ∼= L3V ⊕ A3V , and S2V ⊗ V ∼= S3V ⊕ L3V of

2(cid:1) and dim(X2) = 2(cid:0)d
3(cid:1).

GL(V )-modules. Hence T 3V ∼= S3V ⊕ 2L3V ⊕ A3V .

Proof. (i) Suppose that d > 2 and H preserves a decomposition V = V1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Vd
where the 1-dimensional subspaces Vi = hvii are permuted transitively. Let K := G1 ×
· · · × Gr be the base group of H = GL(V1) ≀ Sd where Gi = GL(Vi). For i, j, k there are
three possibilities for the dimension of Vi + Vj + Vk, depending on the cardinality of the
subset {i, j, k}. Let [A, B] := h[a, b] | a ∈ A, b ∈ Bi. Then A2V ⊗ V has two obvious
H-submodules:

W1 =Xi<j

[Vi, Vj] ⊗ (Vi + Vj),

and

W2 = Xk6∈{i,j}

[Vi, Vj] ⊗ Vk.

It is clear that A2V ⊗ V = W1 + W2. Since

dim(W1) + dim(W2) 6 2(cid:18)d

2(cid:19) + d(cid:18)d − 1

2 (cid:19) = d(cid:18)d

2(cid:19) = dim(A2V ⊗ V ),

the inequality above is an equality and A2V ⊗V = W1 ⊕W2 is an H-module decomposition.
Now

(15)

v1 ∧ v2 ∧ v3 = [v1, v2] ⊗ v3 + [v2, v3] ⊗ v1 + [v3, v1] ⊗ v2,

so W2 contains A3V and dim(W2/A3V ) = d(cid:0)d−1

W1 and W2/A3V are irreducible H-modules.

2 (cid:1) −(cid:0)d

3(cid:1) = 2(cid:0)d

3(cid:1) > 0 if d > 3. We claim that

We may write each 2-dimensional subspace [Vi, Vj] ⊗ (Vi + Vj) of W1 as the sum of two
1-dimensional K-invariant subspaces, which are isomorphic to [Vi, Vj] ⊗ Vi and [Vi, Vj] ⊗ Vj

respectively. Hence W1 can be written as the sum of 2(cid:0)d

are pairwise non-isomorphic as K-modules. As these are permuted transitively by H, we
ﬁnd that W1 is an irreducible H-module.

2(cid:1) 1-dimensional subspaces that

For W2, let ∆ be the set of 3-subsets of {1, . . . , d}. For each δ = {i, j, k} in ∆ deﬁne

Uδ := [Vi, Vj] ⊗ Vk + [Vj, Vk] ⊗ Vi + [Vk, Vi] ⊗ Vj.

Then W2 =Lδ∈∆ Uδ. The diagonal matrix t = (α1, . . . , αd) ∈ K acts on the 3-dimensional

space Uδ as the scalar matrix αiαjαkI. Hence, if δ 6= δ′, then Uδ and Uδ′ are non-isomorphic
K-modules. Let M ∼= S3 be the setwise stabilizer of δ. As M 6 Sd 6 H, we may view Uδ as
an M-module. Since p > 3, Uδ is a sum of 1- and 2-dimensional irreducible M-submodules.
By (15) the 1-dimensional submodule is

A3V ∩ Uδ = hvi ∧ vj ∧ vki = h [vi, vj] ⊗ vk + [vj, vk] ⊗ vi + [vk, vi] ⊗ vj i.

one for each 3-set {i, j, k} ∈ ∆. These K-submodules are permuted transitively by Sd,
and so A3V is an irreducible H-module. Now suppose that N is an H-submodule where

Now A3V is the direct sum of (cid:0)d
3(cid:1) pairwise non-isomorphic 1-dimensional K-submodules,
A3V < N 6 W2. Choose x ∈ N \ A3V and write x =Pδ∈∆ uδ where uδ ∈ Uδ. Then there

exists δ ∈ ∆ for which uδ 6∈ A3V . In order to prove that N = W2 it suﬃces to show that
Uδ 6 N, as Sd is transitive on ∆.

We claim that uδ ∈ N. Assuming the claim is true, then the M-submodule Uδ ∩ N
satisﬁes Uδ ∩ A3V < Uδ ∩ N 6 Uδ and by the above remarks, the only M-submodule of
Uδ properly containing the 1-dimensional submodule Uδ ∩ A3V is Uδ itself. Hence Uδ 6 N
and N = W2.

We now prove the claim. Because Sd is transitive on ∆, we may assume that δ =

{1, 2, 3}. Let

a := (−1, 1, 1, . . . , 1),

b := (−1, −1, 1, . . . , 1),

c := (−1, −1, −1, 1, . . . , 1)

2 (x − xa) = Pδ′∈∆,1∈δ′ uδ′, and y ∈ N. Now observe that
2(y + yb), we have z = Pδ′∈∆,{1,2}⊂δ′ uδ′ and z ∈ N. Now for all δ′ such that

be elements of K. For δ′ ∈ ∆, observe that if 1 ∈ δ′, then uδ′a = −uδ′ and if 1 /∈ δ′,
then uδ′a = uδ′. Thus y := 1
if 1 ∈ δ′ and 2 /∈ δ′ then uδ′b = −uδ′, and if {1, 2} ⊂ δ′ then uδ′b = uδ′. Setting
z := 1
{1, 2} ⊂ δ′ we have uδ′c = uδ′ unless δ′ = {1, 2, 3}. Hence we obtain u{1,2,3} = 1
2(z − zc).
Thus u{1,2,3} ∈ N \A3V , as desired. In summary, we have shown that the only H-submodule
of W2 properly containing A3V is W2 itself. Hence W2/A3V is indeed irreducible as an
∼= W2/A3V
H-module. Thus L3V = (A2V ⊗ V )/A3V = X1 ⊕ X2, where X1
are irreducible.

∼= W1 and X2

(ii) When d = 2, part (i) shows that L3V = X1 is an irreducible H-module, and hence
an irreducible GL(V )-module. When d > 3, there is a non-monomial matrix in GL(V )
which maps a non-zero element of X1 into X2. This proves that L3V is an irreducible
GL(V )-module.

(iii) The map φ : A2V ⊗ V → L3V given by φ([u, v] ⊗ w) = [[u, v], w] is a (well deﬁned)
GL(V )-module homomorphism. Furthermore, it follows from (15) and the Jacobi identity
in L3V that A3V 6 ker(φ). It is clear that φ is surjective. We observe that

A3V (cid:19) = d(cid:18)d

Then T := T 3V equals T A, and hence T = T1 ⊕ T2 ⊕ T3, where Ti = T ei. However,
T1 = S3V and T2 = A3V , and

T = T 2V ⊗ V = (S2V ⊕ A2V ) ⊗ V = (S2V ⊗ V ) ⊕ (A2V ⊗ V ).

10

By the previous paragraph, A2V ⊗V has two composition factors: A3V and L3V . It follows
from the equation T1 ⊕ T2 ⊕ T3 = (S2V ⊗ V ) ⊕ (A2V ⊗ V ) that T3 ∩ (A2V ⊗ V ) = L3V . A
similar argument shows that (V ⊗ A2V ) ∩ T3 = L3V . However, A2V ⊗ V ∼= V ⊗ A2V and
(A2V ⊗ V ) ∩ (V ⊗ A2V ) = A3V . Thus T2 = L3V ⊕ L3V and so S2V ⊗ V = S3V ⊕ L3V
holds, as desired.
(cid:3)

Finally, we must understand L4V when dim(V ) = 2.
Lemma 3.2. Suppose that d = 2 and char(F) 6= 2, 3. Then L4V ∼= A2V ⊗ S2V is an

irreducible GL(V )-module.

Proof. Fix a basis {e1, e2} for V . A routine but lengthy calculation using the Jacobi
identity shows that the left-normed vectors [v1, v2, v3, v4] := [[[v1, v2], v3], v4] span L4V . A
short proof using Magma [3], given in [9], shows that {s1, s2, s3} is a basis for L4V where

s1 = [e1, e2, e1, e1],

s2 = [e1, e2, e1, e2] and s3 = [e1, e2, e2, e2].

Note that s2 = [e1, e2, e2, e1]. Deﬁne the map φ : A2V ⊗ S2V → L4V by:

φ([e1, e2] ⊗ (e1 ⊙ e1)) = s1, φ([e1, e2] ⊗ (e1 ⊙ e2)) = s2, φ([e1, e2] ⊗ (e2 ⊙ e2)) = s3.

Since s2 = [e1, e2, e2, e1], φ is well-deﬁned.
It follows from the linearity of [, ] and the
universality property of the exterior square, symmetric square and the tensor product,
that φ is a linear map. Since φ is surjective, and the dimensions of the respective spaces
are equal, we see that φ is an isomorphism. Moreover, a direct calculation shows that
φ is a GL(V )-module isomorphism. Since S2V is irreducible as a GL(V )-module and
dim(A2V ) = 1, we have that L4V is irreducible as a GL(V )-module.
(cid:3)

4. Aschbacher’s Theorem

An idea pervading Felix Klein’s Erlanger Programm is that there is a correspondence
between geometry and group theory. A group gives rise to a geometry, and ‘interesting’
subgroups give rise (via stabilisers) to ‘interesting’ geometric substructures. Our group will
be GL(d, q), where q = pa, and its ‘interesting’ subgroups will be its maximal subgroups H.
A celebrated result of Aschbacher relates maximal subgroups to geometry. The geometric
subgroups fall into eight (conjugacy) classes of subgroups which we now deﬁne:

C1 the stabiliser of a proper non-zero subspace U of V ;
C2 the stabiliser of an equidimensional direct sum decomposition V = V1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Vr;
C3 the stabiliser of an extension ﬁeld structure Fqr where r is prime;
C4 the stabiliser of an unequal dimensional tensor decomposition V = V1 ⊗ V2;
C5 a subgroup conjugate (modulo scalars) to a linear group over Fq1/r where r is

prime;

C6 the normaliser of an r-subgroup R of symplectic type where r 6= p is prime;
C7 the stabiliser of an equidimensional tensor product decomposition V = V1⊗· · ·⊗Vr;
C8 classical groups in their natural representation.

The following statement of Aschbacher’s Theorem follows [20, Theorem 1.2.1]. An

alternative form of the theorem is given in [28, §3.10.3].

11

Theorem 4.1 (Aschbacher, [1]). Let q be a power of p and suppose H 6 GL(d, q) and

SL(d, q) 66 H. Then

(i) H is contained in a member of (at least one) of the classes C1 – C8, or
(ii) H/Z(H) is almost simple and H acts absolutely irreducibly on the natural module for

GL(d, q).

The subgroups H in Theorem 4.1 satisfying H 6∈ C1 ∪ · · · ∪ C8 are said to be of type C9.
The size of maximal subgroups varies by class: the classes C1 ∪ · · · ∪ C5 ∪ C8 all contain
a ‘large’ subgroup, that is, a subgroup H such that |H| = qO(d2). On the other hand, for
H ∈ C6 ∪ C7, we have |H| = qO(d). The theorem below says that for H ∈ C9 we also have
|H| = qO(d).

Theorem 4.2 (Liebeck [23]). Suppose that G0

∼= PSLn(q), and let G be a group such
that G0 ⊳ G 6 Aut(G0). Let H be a maximal subgroup of G such that G = HG0. Then
H ∈ C1 ∪ · · · ∪ C8, or |H| 6 q3d.

5. Representation theory of maximal subgroups on Lie powers

We now now assume that char(F) = p an odd prime and that F is ﬁnite. Recall
that V is a d-dimensional vector space over F. The aim of this section is to determine
the reducibility of L2V , L3V and L4V (where necessary) as H-modules, for a maximal
subgroup H of GL(V ).
In the cases where the modules are reducible, we also aim to
determine the smallest quotient.

5.1. The reducible C1 case.

Lemma 5.1. Suppose that H = GL(V )U ∈ C1 is the stabiliser of an r-dimensional

subspace U of V where 0 < r < d := dim(V ).

(i) If d > 2, then L2V is a reducible H-module and the dimension of the smallest quotient

(ii) If p > 3 and d = 2, then L2V is an irreducible H-module, and L3V is a uniserial,

module is r if d − r = 1, and (cid:0)d−r

reducible 2-dimensional H-module.

2 (cid:1) otherwise.

Proof. (i) We ﬁrst show that we have a composition series for the H-module A2V as
in Figure 2. Deﬁne π1 : A2V → A2(V /U) by π1(v ∧ w) = (v + U) ∧ (w + U). This map is
a surjective H-module homomorphism, with kernel

(16)

U ∧ V := hu ∧ v | u ∈ U, v ∈ V i.

12

Observe that A2U is an H-invariant subspace of U ∧ V . We claim that {0} ⊆ A2U ⊆
U ∧ V ⊆ A2V is the desired composition series. Note that GL(V /U) and GL(U) act
irreducibly on A2(V /U) and A2U respectively. We construct an H-module isomorphism
U ⊗ (V /U) ∼= (U ∧ V )/A2U as follows. We deﬁne φ : U ⊗ (V /U) → (U ∧ V )/A2U to be the
linear extension of the following map:

u ⊗ (v + U) 7→ u ∧ v + A2U.

It is straightforward to check that φ is well-deﬁned, surjective and an H-module homomor-
phism. Comparing dimensions reveals that φ is an H-module isomorphism and therefore
shows that (U ∧V )/A2U is also irreducible. Hence A2V has a composition series as depicted
in Figure 2, where the factors are irreducible or zero.

To prove that A2V is a uniserial H-module, we must show that {0}, A2U, U ∧ V, A2V
are the only H-submodules of A2V (some may coincide). Using the fact that invertible
matrices of the form ( I 0
∗ ∗ ) lie in H, ﬁx U elementwise and are transitive on V \ U, it follows
that there is no H-invariant complement to A2U in U ∧ V . A similar argument shows that
there is no H-invariant complement to U ∧ V in A2V . Thus A2V is uniserial as claimed
and the dimensions of the composition factors are as shown in Figure 2. Note that, since
d > 2, there are at least two composition factors, so A2V is reducible. If d1 = 0, then
r = d − 1 is the dimension of the smallest quotient module.

(ii) Suppose now that d = 2, r = 1 and p > 3. Then A2V is an irreducible 1-dimensional
H-module and A3V = {0}. Since V is a reducible H-module, L3V ∼= A2V ⊗V is a uniserial
2-dimensional H-module with unique non-trivial submodule A2V ⊗ U.
(cid:3)

5.2. The imprimitive C2 case.

Lemma 5.2. Suppose that H = GL(V1) ≀ Sr ∈ C2 ﬁxes an equidimensional decomposition

V = V1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Vr where 1 < r 6 d and char(F) = p > 2.

(i) If 1 < r < d, then L2V = U1 ⊕ U2 where U1 and U2 are irreducible H-modules

satisfying 0 < d(d/r − 1)/2 = dim(U1) < dim(U2).

(ii) If p > 3 and 2 < r = d, then H acts irreducibly on L2V , and L3V is a sum of two

irreducible H-modules of dimensions 2(cid:0)d

2(cid:1) and 2(cid:0)d
3(cid:1).

(iii) If p > 3 and 2 = r = d, then H acts irreducibly on L2V and L3V , and L4V ∼=

A2V ⊗ S2V ∼= X1 ⊕ X2 where dim(X1) = 2 and dim(X2) = 1.

Proof. (i) Consider the base group K := G1 × · · · × Gr of H where Gi = GL(Vi).
For each i we identify A2Vi with the obvious subspace of A2V . Furthermore, for i 6= j set
Vi ∧ Vj := hu ∧ w | u ∈ Vi, w ∈ Vji mimicking the notation in (16). Then Vi ∧ Vj = Vj ∧ Vi,
and we note that Vi ∧ Vj is isomorphic as a K-module to Vi ⊗ Vj if i 6= j. Hence we have
the following K-module decomposition:

A2V = A2  r
Mi=1

Vi! = U1 ⊕ U2

where U1

∼=

13

r

Mi=1

A2Vi and U2

Vi ⊗ Vj.

∼=Mi<j

Observe that A2Vi and Vi ⊗ Vj are irreducible K-modules. Thus A2V1, . . . , A2Vr are
pairwise non-isomorphic K-submodules of U1, and the Vi ⊗ Vj with i < j are pairwise
non-isomorphic K-submodules of U2 (witnessed by the diﬀering kernels of the action of
K). However, Sr permutes these non-isomorphic K-modules transitively. It follows from
Cliﬀord’s Theorem [5, pp. 343–344] that both U1 and U2 are irreducible H-modules. We
r2 , and 0 < dim(U1) < dim(U2). Hence when r < d

have dim(U1) = r(cid:0)d/r

2(cid:1) d2
2 (cid:1), dim(U2) = (cid:0)r

we have that A2V is a reducible H-module.

(ii) Suppose now that 2 < r = d. By part (i), U1 = {0} and A2V = U2 is an irreducible
H-module. By Lemma 3.1(ii), L3V = X1 ⊕ X2 is a sum of irreducible H-submodules of

dimensions 2(cid:0)d

2(cid:1) and 2(cid:0)d

3(cid:1), respectively.

(iii) Finally, consider the case that 2 = r = d. Then L2V = A2V is 1-dimensional and
A3V = {0}. Hence L3V ∼= A2V ⊗ V is the tensor product of an irreducible H-module with
a 1-dimensional module, and is therefore irreducible.

Restricting the GL(V )-isomorphism L4V ∼= A2V ⊗ S2V in Lemma 3.2, gives an H-

isomorphism. Now H is generated by matrices of the form g = (cid:0) 0 x

non-zero, and the action of these matrices on L4V is understood using the map φ deﬁned
in the proof of Lemma 3.2. It follows that the following is an H-module decomposition:

y 0(cid:1), where x and y are

A2V ⊗ S2V ∼= hv1 ∧ v2 ⊗ v1 ⊙ v1, v1 ∧ v2 ⊗ v2 ⊙ v2i ⊕ hv1 ∧ v2 ⊗ v1 ⊙ v2i.

These 2- and 1-dimensional H-submodules are irreducible, as desired.

(cid:3)

5.3. The extension ﬁeld C3 case. For this case we need some representation theory.
We assume that F = Fq is ﬁnite, char(F) = p and let E = Fqr with r a prime.
In
this case, ΓL(1, E/F) is a maximal subgroup of GL(r, p) [20, Theorem 1.2.1]. The rth
cyclotomic polynomial Φr(t) factors over Fq as a product of equal-degree irreducibles by [22,
Theorem 2.47(ii), p. 61]. This common degree divides r − 1.

Lemma 5.3. Let E = Fqr and F = Fq where r is a prime and q a power of the prime p.
Let V be an irreducible ΓL(1, E/F)-module over F. Then dim(V ) equals r, or divides r − 1.
In particular, the maximum dimension of an irreducible ΓL(1, E/F)-module over F is r.

Proof. Observe that ΓL(1, E/F) is isomorphic to the metacyclic group

H = hφ, µ | φr = µqr−1 = 1, µφ = µqi.

Consider V E = V ⊗F E as an EM-module where M = hµi. As |M| = qr − 1 is coprime
to p, it follows that V E is a completely reducible M-module by Maschke’s Theorem. Let
W be an irreducible EM-submodule of V E. Thus dimE(W ) = 1, as E is a splitting ﬁeld
for M. Hence µ acts as a non-zero scalar, λ(µ) ∈ E say on W .

Case: λ(µ) = λ(µq). Since λ(µ) = λ(µ)q, we have λ(µ) ∈ F. Then hµi acts on V as
the matrix λ(µ)I. It follows that V is an irreducible FH-module if and only if V is an
irreducible hφi-module. Thus, by the remarks preceding this lemma, dim(V ) divides r − 1.
i=0 W φi. Note that W is not isomorphic to W φ
as an EM-module by assumption. Hence U is the sum of pairwise non-isomorphic EM-
submodules, which are permuted transitively by H. Thus U is an irreducible EH-module.

Case: λ(µ) 6= λ(µq). Let U = Lr−1

14

Note also that U is a summand of V E. By [2, 26.6(1)] we have that V is a summand of the
restriction UF, of U to F. By [17, VII Theorem 1.16(e)], UF is a direct sum of isomorphic
modules, each of dimension dimE(U) = r. Hence dimF(V ) = r.
(cid:3)

The computational algebra systems [3] and [8] were used to investigate the submodule
structure of Lie powers for C3 groups H. The ﬁrst n for which LnV was H-reducible turned
out to be completely reducible. From the data we collected, we could guess, but not prove,
the dimension of the smallest quotient H-module of LnV . Thus we suspect that the three
inequalities that appear in Table 6.1 (in the C3 rows) are in fact equalities.

Lemma 5.4. Suppose that H = GL(d/r, Fqr)⋊Gal(Fqr /Fq) ∈ C3 is a subgroup of GL(V )

where V = (Fq)d, and r is a prime, and suppose char(Fq) = p > 2.

(i) If 1 < r < d then H acts reducibly on L2V , preserving a quotient of dimension(cid:0)d/r
2 (cid:1)r.

(ii) If 3 < r = d then H acts reducibly on L2V , with a minimal quotient of dimension d.
(iii) If 3 = r = d and p > 3, then H acts irreducibly on L2V , and reducibly on L3V .
(iv) If 2 = r = d and p > 3, then H acts irreducibly on L2V and L3V , and reducibly

on L4V .

Proof. (i) As above write E = Fqr and F = Fq. We think of H as acting semilinearly on
V ′ = Ed/r, and view V as (V ′)F, i.e., V ′ with scalars restricted to F. Thus dimE(V ′) = d/r
and dimF(V ) = d. Similarly, let T ′ = A2V ′, and let T = (T ′)F. Since d/r > 1, we have

dimF(T ) = r dimE(T ′) = r(cid:0)d/r

η : A2V → T . Certainly ker(η) is a proper submodule of A2V because dim(T ) > 0, and
ker(η) is non-zero because

2 (cid:1) > 0. We construct a surjective FH-module homomorphism

dim(ker(η)) = dim(A2V ) − dim(T ) =(cid:18)d

2(cid:19) − r(cid:18)d/r

2 (cid:19) =

Fix a basis α1, . . . , αr for E over F and a basis v1, . . . , vd/r for V ′. Then V has a basis

and T has a basis

{αivj | 1 6 i 6 r, 1 6 j 6 d/r}

{αivj ∧ vk | 1 6 i 6 r, 1 6 j < k 6 d/r}.

Furthermore, A2V has a basis consisting of vectors of the form αivk ∧ αjvℓ. As αiαj ∈ E,

s=1 λsαs where λs ∈ F. Deﬁne η : A2V → T by

we may write αiαj =Pr

Certainly η is a GL(V ′)-homomorphism, and η(βvk ∧ γvℓ) = βγvk ∧ vℓ for all β, γ ∈ E. As
θ ∈ Gal(E/F) maps αivk to (αθ

Hence η is an H-homomorphism as desired. Since η is a surjective FH-homomorphism,
and 0 < dim(ker(η)) < dim(A2V ), H acts reducibly on A2V . As GL(V ′) acts irreducibly
on A2V ′, it follows that H acts irreducibly on T .

(ii) Suppose that d = r is prime and r > 3. Then H ∼= Cqd−1 ⋊ Cd. We adopt the
notation in the proof of Lemma 5.3 and write H = hφ, µ | φd = µqd−1 = 1, µφ = µqi. Let
e0, e1, . . . , ed−1 be a basis for V over F = Fq. Let A and C be the d × d matrices over F
corresponding to the action of φ and µ on V . Now let E = Fqd and set V E = V ⊗FE. Since C
is irreducible over F, its characteristic polynomial has distinct roots ζ, ζ q, . . . , ζ qd−1 in E.
Thus C is conjugate in GL(d, E) to the diagonal matrix C E := diag(ζ, ζ q, . . . , ζ qd−1). Let AE
be the matrix with eiAE = ei+1 where the subscripts are read modulo d. Then AE satisﬁes
(C E)AE
= (C E)q, and it follows that there exists a matrix in GL(d, E) that conjugates A
to AE and C to C E. The matrices A, C in GL(V ) induce matrices a, c in GL(A2V ) and AE,
C E in GL(V E) induce matrices aE, cE in GL(A2V E). The induced matrices a, c ∈ GL(A2V )
and aE, cE ∈ GL(A2(V E)) are (simultaneously) conjugate in GL(A2(V E)).

Indeed, suppose that ξi,j ∈ F, then ξqj−i

The action of aE and cE relative to the basis ei ∧ ej, 0 6 i < j < d, for A2V E is given
by ei ∧ ejaE = ei+1 ∧ ej+1 and ei ∧ ejcE = ζ qi+qj ei ∧ ej. We show that a typical eigenvalue
ξi,j = ζ qi+qj of cE does not lie in F.
i,j = ξi,j
and ζ qj+q2j−i = ζ qi+qj . Since ζ q2(j−i) = 1 = ζ qd−1, and qd − 1 is coprime to q2(j−i), it
follows that ζ has order 1, a contradiction. As ξi,j is an eigenvalue of c, it follows that
c does not ﬁx an F-subspace of dimension less than d. The d-dimensional E-subspace
U = hei ∧ ei+1 | 0 6 i < di, is invariant under aE and cE. The restrictions of aE and cE
to U have matrices aE
0,1 ), respectively. The subgroup
haE
U i is irreducible by Cliﬀord’s Theorem [5, pp. 343–344]. A simple calculation shows
that the character values of the monomial group haE
U i lie in F, so by a theorem of
Brauer [17, VII Theorem 1.16(e)], the subgroup haE
U i of GL(d, E) is conjugate to an
irreducible subgroup of GL(d, F). In summary, we have proved that every non-zero H-
submodule of A2V has F-dimension at least d, and one has dimension precisely d. As H
can be shown to act completely reducibly on A2V , it follows that the smallest dimensional
proper quotient module of A2V has dimension d.

(iii) Suppose that d = r = 3. The argument in part (ii) shows that H preserves
an irreducible 3-dimensional subspace of A2V = L2V . Thus H acts irreducibly on L2V .
By (2), dim(L3V ) = (33 − 3)/3 = 8 so by Lemma 5.3, H acts reducibly on L3V preserving
a submodule of codimension at most 3.

(iv) Suppose that d = r = 2. Then H acts irreducibly on the 1-dimensional space L2V ,
and on the 2-dimensional space L3V ∼= A2V ⊗ V . Finally, H acts reducibly on L4V by
Lemma 5.3 as dim(L4V ) = (24 − 22)/4 = 3, and it preserves a submodule of codimension
at most 2.

Lemma 5.5. Suppose that H = GL(V1)◦GL(V2) ∈ C4 where 2 6 dim(V1) < dim(V2) and
∼= S2V1 ⊗ A2V2

char(F) 6= 2. Then L2(V1 ⊗ V2) = U1 ⊕ U2 where U1
are irreducible H-modules satisfying 0 < dim(U1) < dim(U2) < dim(V1 ⊗ V2).

∼= A2V1 ⊗ S2V2 and U2

Proof. Let H = GL(V1) ◦ GL(V2) preserve the decomposition V = V1 ⊗ V2 where

2 6 dim(V1) < dim(V2). By (14), we have the following H-module isomorphisms

T 2V = (V1 ⊗ V2) ⊗ (V1 ⊗ V2)
∼= (V1 ⊗ V1) ⊗ (V2 ⊗ V2)

∼=(cid:0)S2V1 ⊕ A2V1(cid:1) ⊗(cid:0)S2V2 ⊕ A2V2(cid:1)
∼=(cid:0)S2V1 ⊗ S2V2 ⊕ A2V1 ⊗ A2V2(cid:1) ⊕ (cid:0)S2V1 ⊗ A2V2 ⊕ A2V1 ⊗ S2V2(cid:1)

∼= S2V ⊕ A2V.

Equating symmetric and anti-symmetric parts gives the following H-module isomorphisms:

S2V ∼= S2V1 ⊗ S2V2 ⊕ A2V1 ⊗ A2V2,
A2V ∼= S2V1 ⊗ A2V2 ⊕ A2V1 ⊗ S2V2.

and

In particular, we see that A2V ∼= L2V is reducible as an H-module. Since S2Vi and A2Vi are
irreducible GL(Vi)-submodules (for i = 1, 2), it follows that S2V1 ⊗ A2V2 and A2V1 ⊗ S2V2
are irreducible modules for GL(V1) × GL(V2) and hence for H = GL(V1) ◦ GL(V2). Since

2 6 d1 < d2 where d1 = dim(V1) and d2 = dim(V2), it is easy to see that 0 <(cid:0)d1
(cid:0)d1+1
2 (cid:1)(cid:0)d2

5.5. The tensor induced case C7. The classes Ci considered so far all contain ‘large’
maximal subgroups of GL(d, p), i.e., ones with |H| = pO(d2). By contrast, none of the
C7 subgroups H are large in this sense; indeed |H| = pO(d). Intuitively, the smaller |H|
is compared to |GL(d, p)| the less likely it is that modules with dimensions much larger
than d remain irreducible, when restricted to H. Thus one might expect that our desired
p-group G has small nilpotency class, and that it is not too hard to construct. The ﬁrst
expectation is true, but not the second, as the small dimensional modules such as L2V and
L3V turn out to be hard to handle.

Theorem 5.6. Let V = V1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ Vr be a vector space over F where p := char(F) 6= 2,
r > 2, and t := dim(V1) = · · · = dim(Vr) > 2. Let H = GL(V1) ≀ Sr 6 GL(V ) preserve the
decomposition V1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ Vr, so H ∈ C7.

(i) If p > 2 and r > 2, then L2V is reducible and the smallest non-trivial quotient module

2(cid:1)r
of L2V has dimension (cid:0)t

(ii) If p > 3 and r = 2, then L2V is an irreducible H-module, and L3V is a reducible
H-module. The smallest dimension of a quotient module of L3V is 4 if t = 2, and
(t + 1)t2(t − 1)2(t − 2)/9 if t > 2.

if r is odd, and r(cid:0)t

Proof. As H ∈ C7, we have H = GL(V1) ≀ Sr 6 GL(V ⊗r

) where t > 2 and r > 2.

(i) Suppose now that V = V1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ Vr where r > 2 and p > 2. Rearranging tensor

factors, and using (14) shows that

T 2V = T 2V1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ T 2Vr = (A2V1 ⊕ S2V1) ⊗ · · · ⊗ (A2Vr ⊕ S2Vr).

Expanding gives 2r summands. We show that collecting these summands into Sr-orbits

if εi = 0.

The summands of Uk are pairwise non-isomorphic irreducible modules for the base group
GL(V1) × · · · × GL(Vr) of H, so by Cliﬀord’s Theorem [5, pp. 343–344], Uk is an irreducible

H-submodule. The formula for dim(Uk) is now clear as dim(A2Vi) =(cid:0)t
(cid:0)t+1
2 (cid:1).

The number of irreducible H-submodules Uk of A2V is the number of odd k satisfying
0 6 k 6 r, namely ⌈r/2⌉. Hence A2V is reducible precisely when r > 2. Suppose that
k0 is odd and dim(Uk0) 6 dim(Uk) for all odd k satisfying 0 6 k 6 r. Observe ﬁrst that
r −k < k implies that dim(Ur−k) > dim(Uk) so we may assume r/2 6 k0 6 r. Second, note

2(cid:1) and dim(S2Vj) =

that if k, ℓ are odd and r/2 6 ℓ < k, then dim(Uℓ) > dim(Uk) follows because (cid:0)r

Hence k0 = r when r is odd, and k0 = r − 1 when r is even. This proves part (i).

(ii) Suppose now that p > 3, r = 2, and V = V1 ⊗ V2. By part (i), L2V is irreducible.
We use Lemma 3.1 to investigate the K-module structure of A2V ⊗V where K = GL(V1)×
GL(V2) is normal in H of index 2. It follows from part (i) that we have the following K-
module decomposition: A2V = (A2V1 ⊠ S2V2) ⊕ (S2V1 ⊠ A2V2) where ⊠ denotes ‘outer
tensor product’ for K. Consider the following K-module decomposition:

ℓ(cid:1) > (cid:0)r
k(cid:1).

A2V ⊗ V ∼=(cid:0)(A2V1 ⊠ S2V2) ⊕ (S2V1 ⊠ A2V2)(cid:1) ⊗ (V1 ⊠ V2)

∼= (A2V1 ⊗ V1) ⊠ (S2V2 ⊗ V2) ⊕ (S2V1 ⊗ V1) ⊠ (A2V2 ⊗ V2).
∼= S3Vi ⊕ L3Vi, so

∼= L3Vi ⊕ A3Vi and S2Vi ⊗ Vi

Lemma 3.1(ii) gives A2Vi ⊗ Vi

A2V ⊗ V ∼= (L3V1 ⊕ A3V1) ⊠ (S3V2 ⊕ L3V2) ⊕ (S3V1 ⊕ L3V1) ⊠ (L3V2 ⊕ A3V2)

∼= (B1 ⊕ C1) ⊠ (A2 ⊕ B2) ⊕ (A1 ⊕ B1) ⊠ (B2 ⊕ C2)

where Ai = S3Vi, Bi = L3Vi, and Ci = A3Vi. Expanding shows that A2V ⊗ V is a sum of
8 irreducible K-modules as follows:

(17)

A2V ⊗ V ∼= P ⊕ Q ⊕ R ⊕ S

18

where

P = A1 ⊠ B2 ⊕ B1 ⊠ A2,
R = B1 ⊠ C2 ⊕ C1 ⊠ B2,

Q = A1 ⊠ C2 ⊕ C1 ⊠ A2,
S = B1 ⊠ B2 ⊕ B1 ⊠ B2.

By Cliﬀord’s Theorem [5, pp. 343–344], P , Q and R are pairwise non-isomorphic
irreducible H-modules, whilst S is the sum of two irreducible H-modules, S1 and S2 say,
each isomorphic to B1 ⊗ B2. Using Lemma 3.1(iii), we reconcile the H-decompositions

A2V ⊗ V = L3V ⊕ A3V

and A2V ⊗ V = P ⊕ Q ⊕ R ⊕ S1 ⊕ S2.

The dimensions of the modules P , Q, R, S1 and S2 are displayed in Table 5.1. Since

L3V is a completely reducible H-module, there exist p, q, r, s1, s2 ∈ {0, 1} such that

dim L3V =

t6 − t2

= p dim P + q dim Q + r dim R + s1 dim S1 + s2 dim S2.

The above gives rise to 32 polynomial equations in t. If t 6= 4, then the only solutions are
(p, q, r, s1, s2) = (1, 0, 1, 1, 0) or (p, q, r, s1, s2) = (1, 0, 1, 0, 1). If t = 4, then there are two
additional possibilities since dim R = dim Q, namely that (p, q, r, s1, s2) = (1, 1, 0, 0, 1) or
(p, q, r, s1, s2) = (1, 1, 0, 1, 0). Renumbering if necessary, assume that S1 6 L3V and thus
S2 6 A3V . Hence, if t 6= 4 we obtain L3V ∼= P ⊕ R ⊕ S1. When t = 4 the additional
possibility that L3V ∼= P ⊕ Q ⊕ S1 arises. As L3V is completely reducible, the smallest
non-zero quotient H-module is isomoporphic to the smallest irreducible H-submodule of
L3V . If t = 2 then c = 0 and L3V ∼= P ⊕S1 and the minimal dimension of an H-submodule
of L3V is 4. If t > 2 then c > 0 and the dimensions of the minimal H-submodules of L3V
are 2ab, 2bc and b2. Since a > c and b > 2c, the dimension of a minimal submodule of L3V
in this case is 2bc = (t + 1)t2(t − 1)2(t − 2)/9.

Lemma 5.8. Suppose that H ∈ C8 where H/Z(H) contains a simple classical group in

its natural representation on V = (Fq)d where q is an odd prime power, and d > 2.

(i) If H is of symplectic type, then H acts reducibly on L2V , and the smallest dimension

of a quotient module is 1.

(ii) If H is of orthogonal type, then H acts irreducibly on L2V , and reducibly on L3V .

Moreover, the smallest dimension of a quotient module of L3V is d or 1.

Proof. Since H ∈ C8, we know H/Z(H) preserves a form β up to non-zero scalar
multiples. Since H is absolutely irreducible, the center Z(H) acts as scalar matrices. Thus
there is no loss of generality in assuming that H (and not H/Z(H)) preserves β up to
scalars.

(i) Suppose that H = CSp(β) is the conformal symplectic group preserving the alternat-
∼= Cq−1.
ing form β : V × V → Fq up to scalar multiples. Recall that CSp(β)/Sp(β) ∼= F×
The linear map π : L2V → Fq satisfying π([v, w]) = β(v, w) is well-deﬁned precisely because
β is alternating. Moreover, since β is an H-invariant form we have that π is H-module
homomorphism, and CSp(β) acts non-trivially on Fq with kernel Sp(β). Clearly π is onto,

q

therefore dim(L2V / ker(π)) = 1. As dim(L2V ) = (cid:0)d

reducible as claimed.

2(cid:1) > 1 for d > 2, we see that L2V is

(ii) Suppose that H preserves the symmetric form β : V × V → Fq up to non-zero
scalar multiples. Since p is odd, H acts irreducibly on A2V , see [23, Table 1]. Deﬁne
π : T 3V → V ⊗ Fq by π(u ⊗ v ⊗ w) = u ⊗ β(v, w). Since H preserves β up to scalars, we
see that π is an H-module homomorphism. Moreover, since

u ∧ v ∧ w = u ⊗ v ⊗ w − u ⊗ w ⊗ v + v ⊗ w ⊗ u − v ⊗ u ⊗ w + w ⊗ u ⊗ v − w ⊗ v ⊗ u

we have

π(u ∧ v ∧ w) = u ⊗ (β(v, w) − β(w, v)) + v ⊗ (β(w, u) − β(u, w)) + w ⊗ (β(u, v) − β(v, u)).
Thus π(A3V ) = {0} since β is symmetric. Now choose vectors u, v and w of V so that
u ⊗ v ⊗ w is a fundamental tensor and such that f (u, w) = 0 and β(v, w) 6= 0 (such a choice

20

is always possible since β is non-degenerate). Then x := u ⊗ v ⊗ w − v ⊗ u ⊗ w ∈ A2V ⊗ V
and π(x) = u ⊗ β(v, w) 6= 0. Hence

A3V 6 ker(π) ∩ (A2V ⊗ V ) < A2V ⊗ V

and the quotient (A2V ⊗ V )/(ker(π) ∩ (A2V ⊗ V )) is isomorphic to a submodule of V ⊗ Fq.
Since the latter is an irreducible H-module, we have that the smallest quotient of L3V has
dimension d or 1.
(cid:3)

Remark 5.9. We do not consider the case when H is a maximal subgroup of GL(d, p)
containing SL(d, p). In this case the irreducible GL(V )-submodules of LnV with p > n, are
likely to restrict to irreducible SL(V )-modules. In the case d = 2 excluded in Lemma 5.8,
H contains Sp(2, p) = SL(2, p).

6. Proof of the main theorem

In this section we complete the proof of Theorem 1. Henceforth we adopt the hypotheses
and notation of that theorem. Since our goal is to ﬁnd p-groups of small class but with large
automorphism groups, we have focussed on the classes of maximal subgroups containing
‘large’ subgroups (in the sense of the comment preceding Theorem 4.2).

Proof of Theorem 1. Let H be a maximal subgroup of GL(V ) lying in the As-
chbacher class Ci where V = Fd
p. We seek a d-generator group G of exponent p and minimal
class such that A(G) = H. Now GL(V ) (and hence H) acts on the sections Bk−1/Bk of
the lower p-series of the d-generator Burnside group B. It follows from Theorem 2.1 that
the minimal class will be at least n if H acts irreducibly on Bk−1/Bk for 1 6 k < n.

Suppose that Bn < X < Bn−1 is H-invariant. Then G := B/X is a proper quotient
of the ﬁnite group Γn(V ) = B/Bn. Also np(G) = n and H 6 NGL(V )(X/Bn) 6 GL(V ) by
Theorem 2.1. However, H is maximal in GL(V ), so NGL(V )(X/Bn) is either H or GL(V ).
But in the constructions in §5, X was chosen to be H-invariant, but not GL(V )-invariant.
Hence NGL(V )(X/Bn) = H = A(G). Note in addition that to minimise |G|, it suﬃces to
choose X such that X/Bn is a maximal H-submodule of Bn−1/Bn which is not GL(V )-
invariant.

Assume that H is a maximal subgroup of GL(d, p) and that case (ii) of Theorem 1 does
not apply. Then H is not of type C6 or C9, and because Fp has no proper subﬁelds, H
does not have type C5, or C8 preserving a unitary form. Suppose now that H is a maximal
subgroup in the class Ci where i ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8}. By Lemmas 5.1, 5.2, 5.4, 5.5, 5.8 and
Theorem 5.6 there exists an n 6 4 such that H acts irreducibly on L1V, . . . , Ln−1V , and
∼= LnV which is not GL(V )-
there is a maximal H-submodule, say X/Bn, of Bn−1/Bn
invariant. The group G = B/X has the desired properties of minimal nilpotency class
i=1 |LiV |. Sometimes there is more than one choice
for X, which yields to diﬀerent isomorphism types of G = B/X. For each G we have
Gn−1 = Bn−1/X. The possible orders of Gn−1 are listed in Table 6.1. For example, in the

(and order) including |G/Gn−1| = Qn−1
C2 case, when r = d, we have that 2(cid:0)d

d > 5.

Lemma 5.8

It remains to bound |G|. In each case |G| = pm where m is less than P4

i=1 f (d, i) =
d + (d2 − d)/2 + (d3 − d)/3 + (d4 − d2)/4. It is not hard to prove that the sum is at most
d4/2 for all d > 2. Hence |G| 6 pd4/2 as claimed.

Remark 6.1. Let H be the C1 maximal subgroup GL(V )U which ﬁxes a proper non-
zero subspace U of V . Let r = dim(U) and let P = (Cp)r × (Cp2)d−r. Then P is abelian

22

and of exponent p2, and it is easy to check that A(P ) = H. The group P has smaller order
than the corresponding group listed in Table 6.1, but the exponent is p2 rather than p.

7. Some open questions

Aschbacher’s Theorem [20, Theorem 1.2.1] and many of our arguments work over an
arbitrary ﬁnite ﬁeld Fq. Can the few places where we assumed that q = p be removed? How
must our results be modiﬁed when p = 2? How large must the nilpotency class of G be in
the cases C6 and C9 which contain no ‘large’ subgroups? How do the multiplication rules (5)–
(7) for the universal groups Γn(Fd) generalise for n > 4? To what extent can collection in
groups of exponent p given by pc-presentations be replaced by symbolic computations in
Lie n-tuple groups? (This type of question is explored in [21], for example.)

Suppose that H is a maximal subgroup of GL(V ) and the irreducible GL(V )-submodules
of L1V, . . . , Ln−1V restrict to irreducible H-submodules, and n is maximal with this prop-
erty. Our examples lead us to ask: Is LnV , viewed as an H-module, always either com-
pletely reducible or uniserial?
