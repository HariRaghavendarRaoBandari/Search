Abstract

We show that strangeness suppression in hadronic and nuclear collisions is fully deter-
mined by the initial energy density of the collision. The suppression factor γs(s), with
√s denoting the collision energy, can be expressed as a universal function of the initial
energy density ǫBj(s), and the resulting pattern is in excellent agreement with data from
p − p, p − P b, Cu − Cu, Au − Au and P b − P b data over a wide range of energies and
for diﬀerent centralities.

The relative hadron production rates in high energy strong interactions are in general
well accounted for in terms of an ideal resonance gas at temperature T and baryochemical
potential µ , with one signiﬁcant caveat. Over a wide range of collision energies, both in pp
and in AA collisions, the rates for the production of strange hadrons are found fall below
the values predicted by an ideal resonance gas in chemical equilibrium; see e.g. [2–4]. The
resonance gas scenario can be maintained, however, by the rather ad hoc introduction of a
strangeness suppression factor γs(s) < 1, with γn
s reducing the production rate of hadrons
containing n strange quarks or antiquarks [5]. With increasing collision energies √s, the
strangeness suppression decreases, i.e., γs(s) is found to approach unity. In Fig. 1, we show
the behavior of γs(s) as function of the collision energy √s in pp and heavy ion (P b− P b,
Au − Au, Cu − Cu) collisions; we return to the details of the mentioned ﬁts a little later
on. With such a suppression factor, one ﬁnds excellent agreement for the relative hadron
abundances in hadronic and nuclear collisions as well as in e+e− annihilation.

Nevertheless, the origin and functional behavior of γs has for a long time remained enig-
matic, as has the diﬀerence in behavior between elementary and nuclear collisions. A
ﬁrst step towards a solution was obtained by noting that in collisions producing only a
small number of strange particles, strangeness conservation should be enforced not only
exactly (canonical instead of grand canonical) [6], but moreover on a local level, within
a strangeness correlation volume Vc < V : the production of a single strange particle
would require that of an antiparticle nearby, not somewhere in some large equivalent
global volume V [7]. Such a requirement is eﬀectively a deviation from global ideal gas
behavior, and it seems necessary only if there are just a few strange hadrons. Once their
numbers become large enough, local compensation is automatically given, so that there

is no longer any need for a speciﬁc strangeness correlation volume. And indeed one ﬁnds
that for Vc/V → 1, the corresponding resonance gas predictions converge to those of an
equilibrium grand canonical formulation.

The theoretical basis for such strangeness correlation volumes was recently provided
through causality considerations for the space-time evolution of high energy interac-
tions [8, 9].
In a boost-invariant production scenario [10] one ﬁnds that the existence
of a deconﬁned quark-gluon plasma is partioned into causally disconnected space-time
regions, similar to the horizon problem in cosmology, with no communication possible
between diﬀerent regions. Hadrons produced at large rapidity arise through the conﬁne-
ment transition of a QGP ﬁreball which is causally disjoint from a ﬁreball leading to low
rapidity hadrons∗, and so one cannot expect strangeness conservation to occur through
interaction between the relevant bubbles. The concept of a global equivalent cluster [2]
thus cannot be applied here: exactly conserved quantum numbers have to be conserved
within (smaller) causally connected volumes.

The aim of the present paper is to show that this scenario leads to a universal description
of strangeness production in high energy collisions, providing a common formulation for
pp and AA collisions at diﬀerent collision energies, diﬀerent centralities, and diﬀerent A.
In Fig. 2, we illustrate the deﬁnition of a ﬁreball in terms of the collision evolution: we
require a causal connection between the most separate points (qR and hL) of the plasma.

In such a scheme, the size d of the causal correlation region is determined by the values
of the QGP formation time τ0 (the “equilibration” time) and the hadronisation time τh,
specifying the onset of conﬁnement. Geometric considerations result in

For boost-invariant hadronisation, the time evolution is governed by the one-dimensional

∗This implies that any dynamical correlations among regions separated by a large rapidity gap must

originate before the equilibration time

where ǫ denotes the energy density and p the pressure. Given the equation of state of
the plasma, we can thus express τ as function of the energy density ǫ. To illustrate, we
consider an ideal quark-gluon plasma, with p = ǫ/3, to obtain

For a realistic description, we can take the equation of state as determined in ﬁnite

a value lying somewhere between the two extremes just considered. For our present
considerations, however, the precise form is not important, as we shall see.

What is crucial is that the spatial size d of the causally correlated region is determined
by ǫ0/ǫh. Since the universal hadronisation energy density ǫh ≃ 0.4 − 0.6 GeV/fm3 is
obtained in lattice QCD studies, we ﬁnd that the correlation volume is speciﬁed fully by
the initial energy density ǫ0(s). For the boost-invariant scheme assumed here, this is given
by the Bjorken expression

with mT ≃ 0.5 GeV and RA = 1.25A1/3. The average charged multiplicity in P b − P b

These expressions specify the initial energy density ǫBj in terms of the collision energy √s,
and this in turn gives us the causal correlation size d. It is thus the initial energy density
which determines the degree of strangeness suppression. If this is correct, we should be
able to relate directly the strangeness suppression as given by γs(s) to the initial energy
densities of pp and AA collisions.

To test this, we use the ﬁts to γs(s) given in [14, 15],

and

with aA = 0.606, ap = 0.5595, bA = 0.0209, bp = 0.0242. In Fig. 1, these ﬁts were shown
together with high energy data. Combining equ’ns. (6-9) with equ’ns. (10 - 11), we obtain
the predicted relation between γs(s) and ǫBj(s) for pp and AA collisions. The result is
shown in Fig. 3 together with the available data from SPS to LHC energies.

AA collisions; black symbols correspond to AA, green to pP b and red to pp data.

In Fig. 1, we had also included the LHC point for p − P b collisions at √s = 5.02 TeV. To

determine the corresponding energy density, we use in eq. (6)

RT = Rp(0.5 ¯Npart)1/3

for the transverse radius, with ¯Npart ≃ 8, as given by [16], together with the average
secondary multiplicity found there. The resulting point is included in Fig. 3.

In Fig. 3, we note ﬁrst of all that the functional forms of γs for AA and pp collisions in
terms of ǫ(s) fully coincide; the diﬀerence between elementary and nuclear collisions seen
in Fig. 1 is simply due to the fact that strangeness suppression is not determined by the
overall collision energy.
Instead, it is governed by the initial energy density. Next we
note that in fact all data are in excellent agreement with such a universal energy density
scaling of strangeness suppression.

As a further test, we can check the variation of γs with the centrality of the collision at
ﬁxed A and √s. This requires a deﬁnition of the initial energy density for non-central
collisions. In the spirit of our form (6), we have used

(13)

with RNp = 1.25(0.5Np)1/3 as an estimate of the energy density as function of the number
of participants Np. This then allows us to enter recent data for γs as function of Np in
Au − Au and Cu − Cu collisions at 200 GeV [17]. In Fig. 4 it is seen to agree quite well
with the universal curve obtained from the central data.

and AA collisions, as in Fig. 3; the circles show the results from non-central collisions.

In closing, we recall that our causality considerations relate the size of the causal correla-
tion region to the life-time of the QGP. Strangeness suppression provides an experimental
measure of the correlation region, while the initial energy density determines the life-time
of the plasma. The observed scaling of γs with ǫBj is thus an observable consequence of
our basic causality correspondence.
Nevertheless, if one were to just ad hoc assume a γs(s) − ǫ(s) correlation, the results of
Figs. 3 and 4 would remain. On a phenomenological level, one thus also ﬁnds that the
degree of strangeness suppression in hadronic and nuclear collisions is fully determined by

5

the initial energy density. A speciﬁc example of this (the K −/π ratio) was already noted
some time ago [18].
