Abstract

A new parametrization of the multi-channel S-matrix is used to ﬁt scattering data and
then to locate the resonances as its poles. The S-matrix is written in terms of the
corresponding “in” and “out” Jost matrices which are expanded in the Taylor series of
the collision energy E around an appropriately chosen energy E0. In order to do this,
the Jost matrices are written in a semi-analytic form where all the factors (involving the
channel momenta and Sommerfeld parameters) responsible for their “bad behaviour”
(i.e. responsible for the multi-valuedness of the Jost matrices and for branching of the
Riemann surface of the energy) are given explicitly. The remaining unknown factors
in the Jost matrices are analytic and single-valued functions of the variable E and are
deﬁned on a simple energy plane. The expansion is done for these analytic functions
and the expansion coeﬃcients are used as the ﬁtting parameters. The method is tested
on a two-channel model, using a set of artiﬁcially generated data points with typical
error bars and a typical random noise in the positions of the points.

Introduction

The main parameters that characterize any quantum resonance, are the collision energy Er,
at which this state can be excited, and the width Γ that determines the lifetime of the state.

1

For a multi-channel system the total width is the sum of the partial widths, Γ = Γ1 + Γ2 + · · · ,
where Γn/Γ gives the relative probability of decaying into the n-th channel. There are many
diﬀerent methods for determining these parameters from a set of scattering data (several of
them are described in Refs. [1, 2]). These methods form two big groups based on two princi-
pally diﬀerent approaches.

Within one approach, the parameters Er, Γ, Γ1, Γ2, etc are treated as the adjustable
variables in a procedure of ﬁtting the available experimental data. The simplest and most well-
known example of such a method is the Breit-Wigner parametrization of the amplitude [3].
A common feature of all of the methods belonging to this category, is that the number of
resonances is ﬁxed from the outset. All these methods use some parametric expression for the
amplitude, or for the S-matrix, or directly for the cross section, where the resonance singu-
larities (or the zigzags of the cross section) are embedded into this parametric expression by
hand. These methods only diﬀer in the method of parametrization and in the derivation of
the parametric expression.

Within the second approach, the resonances are considered as the poles of the S-matrix
at the complex energies Er − iΓ/2 in an appropriate domain of the Riemann surface of the
energy. The S-matrix is written in a more general form with some adjustable parameters
that do not necessarily coincide with the resonance parameters. Usually, it is not known be-
forehand how many resonances can be found (if any). After ﬁtting the data at real collision
energies, the analytic expression for the S-matrix thus obtained, is examined at complex en-
ergies where the poles (if found) are interpreted as the resonances. The Pad´e approximation
of the S-matrix [1, 4, 5] and the Laurent-Pietarinen series expansion of the amplitude [6] can
be mentioned as examples.

The method we describe here belongs to the second category and is based on the rigorous
semi-analytic expression for the N-channel Jost matrix derived in Ref. [7]. In that expression,
all the factors responsible for the “bad behaviour” of the Jost matrix (i.e. factors depending
on the Sommerfeld parameters and the channel momenta responsible for the branching of
the Riemann surface) are given explicitly. The remaining unknown factors are analytic and
single-valued functions of E deﬁned on a simple energy plane. These functions are expanded
in the Taylor series, and the expansion coeﬃcients serve as the ﬁtting parameters.

2 Parametrization

In Ref. [7], it was shown that for a non-relativistic reaction of the type a + b → c + d involving
charged particles, the N-channel Jost matrix has the following general form:

are the channel momenta determined by the diﬀerences between the total energy E and the
channel thresholds En, as well as by the corresponding reduced masses µn; the channel angular
momenta and the Sommerfeld parameters are ℓn and ηn = µne2Z1Z2/(kn2); the function

Cℓ(η) =

ψ(z) =

Γ′(z)
Γ(z)

,

ˆη =

k2

.

(4)

It was shown that the remaining unknown matrices A(E) and B(E) in Eq. (1) are single-valued
and analytic functions of the energy, deﬁned on a simple energy plane without branching points.
All the complicated topology of the Riemann surface where the Jost functions are deﬁned, is
determined by the coeﬃcients of the matrices A(E) and B(E), given in Eq. (1) explicitly.

If for a given energy E the Jost matrices (1) are known, then the corresponding S-matrix

is just their “ratio”,

and the scattering cross section for the channel n → m can be found as

S(E) = f (out)(E)(cid:2)f (in)(E)(cid:3)

(7)

on the Riemann surface of the energy, where

det f (in)(E) = 0

(8)

and therefore where the S-matrix has poles.

The energy surface has a square-root branching point at every channel threshold En. This
is because the Jost matrices depend on the energy E via the channel momenta (2) and for
each of them there are two possible choices of the sign in front of the square root. The reso-
nance spectral points are located on the so called non-physical sheet of this Riemann surface,
i.e. such a layer of the surface where all the channel momenta have negative imaginary parts.
In the numerical calculations, the choice of the sheet is done by an appropriate choice of the
signs in front of the square roots (2).

Since the matrices A(E) and B(E) are analytic, they can be expanded in the Taylor series
around any complex point E0. Near this point, they can therefore be approximated by the
ﬁrst M terms of these series:

A(E) ≈

B(E) ≈

M

Xi=0
Xi=0

M

ai(E0)(E − E0)i ,

bi(E0)(E − E0)i ,

(9)

(10)

where the expansion coeﬃcients ai and bi are (N × N)-matrices. These matrices depend only
on the choice of the point E0. After ﬁnding them, the Jost matrices (1) can be used at any
complex energy E within a circle around E0 where the approximations (9, 10) are satisfactory.

We treat the elements of the matrices ai and bi as the adjustable parameters in the
procedure of ﬁtting experimental cross section. After ﬁnding the optimal values for them,
we look for the roots of Eq. (8) and thus ﬁnd the resonance parameters Er and Γ. As to
the partial widths Γn, they can easily be found following the procedure described in Ref. [8].
Indeed, we know their sum Γ = Γ1 + Γ2 + · · · + ΓN and we can ﬁnd their ratios (see Ref. [8]):

.

(11)

At a resonance energy, E = E, all the elements of the S-matrix are singular because all of
them have the same singular factor 1/ det f (in)(E). However, in the ratio (11) this factor

cancels out. Therefore, if we explicitly invert the matrix f (in) and use it in Eq. (5) without
common factor 1/ det f (in), then we can avoid numerical evaluation of the limit (11). In the
simplest case of a two-channel problem, we obtain:

(12)

It should be noted that such a simple and numerically stable procedure for calculating the partial
widths is only possible when the Jost matrices are parametrized. If we were parametrizing the
S-matrix directly, then the limits (11) would have to be calculated numerically as the ratios
of singular functions.

3 Fitting

We assume that there are sets of experimental data available for at least one channel n → m
(or perhaps for several channels), i.e. the cross sections

i = 1, 2, . . . , N (mn)

with the corresponding experimental errors (standard deviations) δ(mn), measured at the colli-
sion energies E(mn)
. The center E0 of the expansions (9, 10) can be chosen somewhere within
the interval covered by these collision energies (where we expect to ﬁnd a resonance). The
optimal values of the expansion parameters are found by minimizing the following χ2 function

where the ﬁtting cross section σﬁt
mn depends on the expansion coeﬃcients via Eqs. (6), (5)
and (1). The last sum in the above χ2 function makes the ﬁtted S-matrix symmetric in ac-
cordance with the detailed balance theorem (see a more detailed discussion in Ref. [9]). The

5

minimization is done using the MINUIT code [11, 12].

The number of the adjustable parameters depends on the number N of the existing chan-
nels (the data do not have to be available for all of them) and on the number M of the
terms in the Taylor series (9, 10). Generally speaking, the expansion coeﬃcients a(E0) and
b(E0) are the N × N matrices of complex elements. However, as was shown in Ref. [7], they
become real matrices if the point E0 is on the real axis. Therefore, if E0 is on the interval
covered by the experimental energies E(mn)
, the the total number of real ﬁtting parameters is
2(M + 1)N 2.

4 Example

In order to demonstrate the eﬃciency of the proposed method, we choose a model two-channel
problem where the parameters of the resonances can be determined in an exact way. For this
model, we generate artiﬁcial data points with a typical distribution of errors.
In addition to
the error-bar for each pseudo-data point, we introduce a random shift (up or down) from the
exact cross section curve, i.e. a typical experimental “noise”. Using these points, we extract
the resonance parameters and compare them with the corresponding exact values.

Our artiﬁcial data points are generated using the following two-channel potential having a

Coulomb tail:

V (r) =  −1.0 −7.5

−7.5

7.5 ! r2e−r +  1 0

0 1 ! 1

r

.

(14)

The short-range term in this potential is the same as in the famous Noro-Taylor model [10].
The units in Eq. (14) are therefore the same, namely, they are such that the reduced masses
for both channels are equal to one, µ1 = µ2 = 1, with c = 1, and both angular momenta are
zero, ℓ1 = ℓ2 = 0. The threshold energies for the channels are E1 = 0 and E2 = 0.1.

For a given potential, the matrices A(E) and B(E) in Eq. (1) can be found as the solutions
of diﬀerential equations derived in Ref. [7]. This can be done for any complex energy with the
help of the complex rotation of the coordinate described in Ref. [8]. In this way we can ﬁnd
the exact Jost matrices and therefore the exact cross section as well as the exact resonance
parameters. The ﬁrst six resonances thus located for the potential (14) are listed in Table 1.

For each of the elastic channels, (1 → 1) and (2 → 2), we generated 30 artiﬁcial data
points in the energy interval 6 < E < 11. In order to make them more realistic, these points

distribution, i.e. the values σmn(E(mn)

where Gi were the normally distributed random numbers with the mean value 1 and the stan-
dard deviation ∆. We used three values of ∆, namely, 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10. This was done
to test the stability of the method.

The center of expansion was taken as E0 = 8.

In the case of low experimental noise
(∆ = 0.01), we used M = 5, i.e. the ﬁrst six terms of the series (9, 10) were taken into
account. For higher noise, the number of terms in the expansions was smaller, namely, M = 3.
The reason for such a choice was that with larger M the ﬁtting curve tries to pass through
almost all the data points and thus does noisy zigzags, which result in a loss of overall accuracy.

Fig. 1 shows the exact cross section σ11(E), the artiﬁcial data points with ∆ = 0.01, and
the curve obtained by ﬁtting these points. The same information for the channel (2 → 2) is
given in Fig. 2 (also for ∆ = 0.01). Similarly, Figures 3, 4 and 5, 6 show the corresponding
exact and ﬁtted cross sections as well as the data points for stronger experimental noise,
namely, for ∆ = 0.05 and ∆ = 0.10.

In ﬁtting the data points in the elastic channels (1 → 1) and (2 → 2) all matrix el-
ements of the Jost matrices are involved. As a result, not only the diagonal but also the
oﬀ-diagonal elements of the S-matrix should be close to the correct values. This means that

even without having any data points in the inelastic channels, we should obtain the cross
sections σ21(E) and σ12(E) that are not far from the corresponding exact curves. Fig. 7
shows the exact cross section for the inelastic channel (1 → 2) and the curves obtained for
it with ∆ = 0.01, 0.05, 0.10. Of course, as one would expect, the greater the accuracy of
the experimental data, the more accurate is the prediction for the cross section in the channel
where no data are available.

After ﬁtting the data, we looked for the roots of Eq. (8) on the non-physical sheet of the
Riemann surface of the energy. For this sheet, the signs in Eq. (2) are chosen in such a way
that both channel momenta k1 and k2 have negative imaginary parts. The roots thus found
correspond to the resonance spectral points. They are listed in Table 2 for all three levels
of the experimental noise. Of course the more accurate the measurements, the closer to the
exact values are the extracted resonance parameters. Even with very high experimental noise
(∆ = 0.10) we are still able to extract at least the ﬁrst resonance with a reasonable accuracy.

5 Conclusion

The main idea of the proposed method has its roots in the so called “eﬀective-range expan-
sion” widely used in nuclear and atomic physics (see, for example, Ref. [1]). Within this
approach, a certain function of the scattering phase-shift is expanded in the power series of
the collision energy, and the expansion coeﬃcients are used as the adjustable parameters to
ﬁt experimental data. Traditional eﬀective-range expansion is very useful but is limited to low
energies. Moreover, it is diﬃcult to apply it to multi-channel processes.

We generalize this approach and thus remove all these limitations. First of all, we ex-
pand a more fundamental quantity: the Jost matrix. When the Jost-matrix expansion in the
power series is obtained, one can easily derive the corresponding expansion of the S-matrix,
the phase-shift, or any other quantity that is needed. Secondly, it is not necessary to do the
expansion near the point E = 0. Actually, the expansion can be done around any complex
value of variable E. Concerning the multi-channel problems, for the Jost-matrices, this does
not pose any diﬃculty. Simply, the expansion coeﬃcients become matrices.

In order to expand a function in the Taylor series of E, one has to be sure that this func-
tion is an analytic and single-valued function of E. However, all the quantities describing the
scattering processes (amplitude, S-matrix, Jost matrix, etc) are multi-valued functions deﬁned
on a complicated Riemann surface of the energy with the number of branch points equal to
the number of channels.
In order to circumvent this diﬃculty, we use earlier derived general
semi-analytic expression for a multi-channel Jost matrix, where all the factors responsible for
its “bad behaviour”, are given explicitly. The remaining unknown functions are more simple,
more smooth, and (more importantly) are analytic and single-valued functions deﬁned on a
simple energy plane. We only do the expansion for these functions.

In our earlier publication [9], we demonstrated how the proposed method works for the
reactions involving neutral particles.
In the present paper, we consider a more general case
when the potential has both a short-range part and a Coulomb tail. Similarly to the simple
eﬀective-range theory, presence of the Coulomb potential makes the explicit coeﬃcients in
the semi-analytic expression for the Jost matrix more complicated. However, the remaining
functions of E are still smooth and can be approximated by just a few terms of the Taylor
series. We have demonstrated this using a two-channel model.

We have shown that even with rather inaccurate experimental data (∆ = 0.10 in our
model) the resonances can still be found. For the narrow resonance, we managed to reproduce
not only the energy and total width, but the partial widths as well, when the data points had
rather big deviations from the exact values. For a wide resonance (the resonance number 2)
with such a high experimental noise, we still obtained reasonable parameters. And even the
energy of the extremely wide resonance (number 3) was obtained not far from the exact value.
This shows that the proposed method is accurate and stable.

One of the advantages of the proposed method is that the ﬁtting procedure involves all
matrix elements of the Jost matrix and therefore all elements of the S-matrix even if the data
are available just in one channel. The resulting S-matrix should therefore be correct in all
channels. This means that by ﬁtting accurately-measured data in one or two channels, we
could in principle obtain a reasonable estimate for the cross section in the other channels where
the measurements are diﬃcult or impossible.

It should be noted that the proposed method is non-relativistic and therefore cannot be

directly used in high-energy physics. There are however a wide range of problems in atomic
and low-energy nuclear physics, where it could ﬁnd applications.
In principle, one can try
the same parametrization for high energies as well, if the relativistic relation between the

energy and momentum, E = p2k2c2 + µ2c4, is used in all the formulae. Such “intuitive”

inclusion of relativistic kinematics into non-relativistic operators is very common for various
parametrizations of scattering data in particle physics. In our case, however, this would mean
that the mathematical rigor and substantiation are lost.
