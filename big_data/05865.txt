Polychromatic Colorings on the Hypercube

Abstract

Given a subgraph G of the hypercube Qn, a coloring of the edges of Qn
such that every embedding of G contains an edge of every color is called a
G-polychromatic coloring. The maximum number of colors with which it is
possible to G-polychromatically color the edges of any hypercube is called the
polychromatic number of G. To determine polychromatic numbers, it is only
necessary to consider a structured class of colorings, which we call simple. The
main tool for ﬁnding upper bounds on polychromatic numbers is to translate
the question of polychromatically coloring the hypercube so every embedding of
a graph G contains every color into a question of coloring the 2-dimensional grid
so that every so-called shape sequence corresponding to G contains every color.
After surveying the tools for ﬁnding polychromatic numbers, we apply these
techniques to ﬁnd polychromatic numbers of a class of graphs called punctured
hypercubes. We also consider the problem of ﬁnding polychromatic numbers
in the setting where larger subcubes of the hypercube are colored. We exhibit
two new constructions which show that this problem is not a straightforward
generalization of the edge coloring problem.

Introduction

For n ∈ Z, n ≥ 1, the n-dimensional hypercube, denoted by Qn, is the graph with
V (Qn) = {0, 1}n, and edges between vertices which diﬀer in exactly one coordinate.
For any graphs G, H, a subgraph of H isomorphic to G is called an embedding of G in
H. Given a set R of r colors, an edge coloring of a graph G with r colors is a surjective
function χ : E(G) → R assigning a color to each edge of G. All colorings of graphs
will refer to edge colorings, unless otherwise noted. Given a ﬁxed graph G, an edge
coloring of a hypercube with r colors such that every embedding of G contains an
edge of every color is called a G-polychromatic r-coloring. Given a graph G, denote by
p(G) the maximum number of colors with which it is possible to G-polychromatically
color the edges of any hypercube. Call p(G) the polychromatic number of G.

Motivated by Tur´an type problems on the hypercube, Alon, Krech, and Szab´o [1]
introduced the notion of polychromatic coloring on the hypercube and proved bounds
for the polychromatic number of Qd.

Prior to the work of Alon, Krech, and Szab´o [1], coloring arguments had also been used
to give bounds on Tur´an type problems on the hypercube, for example by Conder [4]
and Axenovich and Martin [2]. In [6], a condition was given which, if satisﬁed by a
graph G, implies p(G) ≥ 3.
In this paper we begin by surveying what is known about polychromatic colorings on
the hypercube. In Section 2 we establish that when studying polychromatic color-
ings, we need only consider a speciﬁc type of coloring called a simple coloring (such
colorings were called Ramsey in [5]). In Section 3, we use the idea of simple coloring
to transform the problem of edge coloring the hypercube so that a given subgraph
is polychromatic to one of coloring a rectangular grid so that a collection of subsets
is polychromatic.
In this context, Lemma 5 provides the key insight to prove up-
per bounds on polychromatic numbers. All known lower bounds for polychromatic
numbers come from explicit constructions, and at the end of the section we give an
example by proving the lower bounds in Theorems 1 and 2.

2

Following this survey, we show in Section 4 how to use these methods to determine
the value of p(G) for some graphs G where p(G) was not previously known, for
example hypercubes with one edge or vertex deleted. We call these graphs punctured
hypercubes. Theorem 10 gives the polychromatic number for any odd-dimensional
punctured hypercube, and Theorems 11 and 12 give the polychromatic number for
punctured Q4’s. For even-dimensional punctured hypercubes with dimension greater
than 4, Theorem 13 provides a lower bound on the polychromatic number, but we can
not determine it exactly. The current best bounds are summarized in Corollary 14.
The section concludes with suggestions for future research.

Section 5 concerns a generalization of the problem proposed by Alon, Krech, and
Szab´o [1] where instead of edges, subcubes of a ﬁxed dimension are colored. Previ-
ously, ¨Ozkahya and Stanton [7] had generalized the bounds given in Theorem 1 to
this setting. If this more general problem were a straightforward generalization of
the edge-coloring problem, the polychromatic number would be equal to the lower
bound. However Theorems 20 and 21 provide two constructions that show this is not
the case, and thus new ideas will be required to determine polychromatic numbers in
this setting.

1.1 Notation for Hypercubes

We refer to the n coordinates of a vertex as bits, and given an edge {x, y}, we refer
to the unique bit where xi 6= yi as the ﬂip bit. We represent an edge of Qn by an
n-bit vector with a star in the ﬂip bit. For example, in Q4, we represent the edge
between vertices [0100] and [0101] by [010∗]. Similarly, we represent an embedding
of Qd in Qn by an n-bit vector with stars in d coordinates. For instance [1 ∗ 00∗] is
the embedding of Q2 in Q5 with vertices {[10000], [11000], [10001], [11001]} and edges
{[1∗ 000], [1000∗], [1∗ 001], [1100∗]}. We call edges with the same ﬂip bit parallel, and
the class of edges with ﬂip bit i the ith parallel class. For an edge e ∈ E(Qn) with
ﬂip bit j deﬁne the preﬁx sum l(e) =Pj−1

i=1 xi and postﬁx sum r(e) =Pn

i=j+1 xi.

2 Simple Colorings

Recall that for an edge e ∈ E(Qn), l(e) is the number of 1’s to the left of the star
in e, and r(e) is the number of 1’s to the right. Call a coloring χ of the hypercube
simple if χ(e) is determined by l(e) and r(e) (such colorings were called Ramsey in
[5]). The following lemma tells us that when studying polychromatic colorings on
the hypercube, we need only consider simple ones. The proof is essentially from [5],
building on ideas from [1].
Lemma 3 Let k ≥ 1 and G be a subgraph of Qk. If p(G) = r, then there is a simple
G-polychromatic r-coloring on Qk.

3

Proof: Fix k. We show that if n is suﬃciently large and Qn has a G-polychromatic
r-coloring, then it contains a subgraph Qk with a simple coloring.

Suppose that n is large and χ is a G-polychromatic r-coloring of Qn. We will use
Ramsey’s theorem for k-uniform hypergraphs with rk2k−1 colors. We deﬁne a rk2k−1-
coloring of the k-subsets of [n]. Fix an arbitrary ordering of the edges of Qk. For an
arbitrary subset S of the indices, deﬁne cube(S) to be the subcube whose ∗ coordinates
are at the positions of S and all other coordinates are 0. Let S be a k-subset of [n],
and deﬁne the color of S to be the vector whose coordinates are the χ-values of the
edges of the k-dimensional subcube cube(S) (according to our ﬁxed ordering of the
edges of Qk). By Ramsey’s theorem, if n is large enough, there is a set T ⊆ [n] of
k2 + k − 1 coordinates such that the color-vector is the same for any k-subset of T .
Fix a set S of k particular coordinates from T : those which are the (ik)th elements
of T for i ∈ [k].
We show the coloring of cube(S) is simple. Let e1 and e2 be two edges of cube(S)
such that l(e1) = l(e2) and r(e1) = r(e2). Since there are at least k − 1 elements
in T in between each coordinate of S, as well as k − 1 elements to the left of the
ﬁrst coordinate of S and to the right of the last coordinate of S, there is a set of k
coordinates S ′ ⊆ T and an edge e3 of cube(S ′) such that
(i) e3 is the same edge when restricted to S as e1 and

(ii) e3 occupies the same position in the ordering of edges in cube(S ′) as e2 occupies

in cube(S).

Thus χ(e1) = χ(e3) = χ(e2), so the coloring of cube(S) is a simple G-polychromatic
r-coloring.

For example, suppose k = 6 and ignoring all coordinates not in T , suppose

e1 = xxxxx0xxxxx1xxxxx1xxxxx ∗ xxxxx0xxxxx1xxxxx
e2 = xxxxx1xxxxx1xxxxx ∗ xxxxx0xxxxx1xxxxx0xxxxx

where the coordinates in T but not S are represented by x. Then a possibility for e3
is

e3 = xxxxxxxxxxx1xxxxx1xxxxx ∗ xxxxx0xxxxx10xxxx.

3 Techniques for Finding Bounds on p(G)

In a simple coloring of the hypercube, we refer to all edges e with the same value of
(l(e), r(e)) as a color class. For example, all edges e with l(e) = 2 and r(e) = 5 are
in color class (2, 5). We begin with an elementary example of how Lemma 3 allows
us to prove upper bounds on polychromatic numbers.

Proposition 4 Denote by Q3 \ v the graph Q3 with one vertex deleted. Then p(Q3 \
v) ≤ 3.
Proof:
By Lemma 3, we need to consider only simple colorings. Consider the
embedding of Q3 \ v with the vertex [1110000. . .] deleted from the cube [***0000. . .].
This graph has edges in only three color classes, (0, 0), (1, 0), and (0, 1), and thus can
only contain three colors in a simple coloring.

This example illustrates a general scheme for proving upper bounds on p(G): Given
a graph G, show that in an arbitrary simple coloring there is some embedding of G in
Qn that contains edges in only a small number of color classes. For instance, applying
the argument of Proposition 4 to Qd gives the upper bound in Theorem 1. To do
better, we need Lemma 5.

Arrange the set of color classes in a rectangular grid, with the ith row containing the
color classes (a, b), with a + b = i, and the ith column containing classes of the form
(i, j), as shown in Figure 1. We translate the question of polychromatically coloring
the hypercube so every embedding of a graph G contains every color into a question of
coloring the grid of color classes so that every so-called shape sequence corresponding
to G (which is deﬁned below) contains every color.

Deﬁne a region of the grid to be all color classes contained in some consecutive rows
and consecutive columns. A shape is a ﬁnite set of elements of the grid. Two shapes
are congruent if one is a translation of the other, i.e. if S = {(a1, b1), (a2, b2), . . . , (ak, bk)}
then S ′ ∼= S if and only if S ′ = {(a1 + i, b1 + j), (a2 + i, b2 + j), . . . , (ak + i, bk + j)} for
some i, j ∈ Z. The width w(S) of a shape S = {(a1, b1), (a2, b2), . . . , (ak, bk)} is given
by maxi,j |ai − aj|. We say S is located at the column of its leftmost element, i.e. S is
located at column mini(ai). A shape list is a ﬁnite list of shapes S1, . . . , Sk, with the

restriction that if i < j then Si is not to the right of Sj. Two shape lists are congruent
if each contains the same number of shapes, and corresponding shapes in the lists are
congruent and are horizontal translations of each other. A shape sequence S is the
set of all shape lists congruent to a speciﬁc list. An instance of a shape sequence S is
one particular list–when the context is clear, we will not always distinguish between
a shape sequence and an instance of a shape sequence, since specifying any instance
determines all other instances of the sequence (see Figure 2). Let the width w(S) of a
sequence equal the width of its widest shape. For the height h(S) of a sequence, if is
is the smallest row index where some shape in S contains some element, and if il is the
largest row index where some shape in S contains some element, let h(S) = il− is + 1.
Finally, given a shape sequence S, let p(S) be the maximum number of colors such
that for any rectangular grid, there is a coloring of the elements of the grid so that
every instance of S contains an element of every color.

Proof: Consider a region R with h(S) rows and n columns colored with colors
{1, 2, . . . , p(S)}. Assume that every instance of S in this region contains every color,
i.e. it is not possible to ﬁnd an instance of S in these rows where every shape in the
sequence lacks a particular color. Thus for each color l, 1 ≤ l ≤ p(S), we can partition
the interval [1, n] into kl intervals [1, cl
kl−1, n], with the property that
kl ≤ k and all copies of Sj located at columns in the jth interval contain color l. We

The condition that every instance of S contains every color guarantees that this

there are values cl

k−1 must contain color l, and the procedure will terminate in Step 2. Let C be the
set {1, c1
kp(S)}. Relabel the elements of
C so that C = {c1, c2, . . . , cq} and c1 ≤ c2 ≤ · · · ≤ cq. Since q ≤ k · p(S) + 1 and we
can choose n as large as we want, we can ﬁnd a diﬀerence cp − cp−1 as large as we
want. Choose n large enough so that this number m = cp − cp−1 is much bigger than
w(S). This diﬀerence corresponds to a region R′ with m columns (the columns in
the interval [cp−1, cp)), where for each color l there is a shape S l ∈ S such that every
copy of S l contains the color l.
For each color l, and all 1 ≤ i ≤ h(S) let li be the number of times the color l appears
in the ith row in R′. Any appearance of l in the ith row can be contained in at most
X i copies of S l. There are at least m − w(S) copies of S l in the region, and thus

Since there are m columns in the region R′, 1i + 2i + · · · + p(S)i = m, and if we add
up the equations for each color, we get

X 1m + X 2m + · · · + X h(S)m ≥ (m − w(S))p(S).

To ﬁnish the proof, divide both sides by m, and note that by making m large, (m −
w(S))/m can be as close to 1 as desired.
Now to prove upper bounds on p(G), we translate problems about polychromatically
coloring graphs into problems about polychromatically coloring shape sequences. We
consider an arbitrary simple coloring of an enormous hypercube. Then we note that

The

embedding

the color classes covered by an embedding of G are a shape sequence S in the grid of
color classes. Further, any instance of S corresponds to the color classes covered by
the edges of some embedding of G. Since Lemma 5 gives an upper bound on p(S),
we get an upper bound on p(G).

As an example of how to apply Lemma 5, we now prove the upper bound on p(Qd) in
Theorem 2. This result was originally proved in [5], but this proof is more streamlined,
and will provide useful preparation for proving new results later. Deﬁne an i × j
parallelogram to be a set of color classes of the following form: {(a + α, b + β) :
0 ≤ α < j, 0 ≤ β < i}. We say that a color class is at coordinate (α, β) in such a
parallelogram if it is of the form (a + α, b + β).

For an example of a shape sequence corresponding to an embedding of a graph,
consider the embedding [1101*100010*111*00101*] of Q4 in Q22, see Figure 3. Edges
using the leftmost star are in color classes (3,7), (3,8), (3,9), and (3,10), a 4 × 1
parallelogram. Edges using the second star from the left are in color classes (5,5),
(5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,6), and (6,7), a 3 × 2 parallelogram. Edges using the third
star from the left are in color classes (8,2), (8,3), (9,2), (9,3), (10,2), and (10,3), a
2 × 3 parallelogram. Edges using the fourth star from the left are in color classes
(10,0), (11,0), (12,0), and (13,0), a 1 × 4 parallelogram. Thus the shape sequence
corresponding to Q4 consists of four parallelograms, all occupying the same four
rows, where each parallelogram corresponds to the edges using one of the four stars.
Further, we can create any other instance of this shape sequence in the same four
rows by rearranging some of the stars. For example, [1101*100010*111**00101] would
have the ﬁrst three shapes identical, with the fourth shape shifted two columns to
the left. These observations are generalized for Qd in the following fact.
Fact 6 Let n ≥ d ≥ 1. Every shape sequence for an embedding of Qd in Qn consists
of d shapes S1, . . . , Sd where Si is a (d − i + 1) × i parallelogram, and each shape
occupies the same d rows. The color classes in Si correspond to the edges using the

ith star from the left. Conversely, every instance of such a shape sequence corresponds
to some embedding of Qd in Qn.

See Figures 2, 4, and 5 for examples of shape sequences corresponding to Q3, Q4, and
Q5, respectively.

Proof of Theorem 2, upper bound: By Lemma 3, we may consider a simple
Qd-polychromatic p(Qd)-coloring on an arbitrarily large hypercube. Fact 6 describes
the shape sequence for Qd. For any of the parallelograms in the shape sequence, the
maximum number of color classes in the ith row is min{i, d − i + 1}. Thus, using the
notation of Lemma 5, in the shape sequence for Qd, X i = maxj X i
j = min{i, d−i+1}.
Applying Lemma 5, we get p(Qd) ≤ 1 + 2 + · · · + ⌈d/2⌉ + · · · + 2 + 1 = (d + 1)2/4 if
d is odd, and d(d + 2)/4 if d is even.

We now turn our attention to lower bounds. To prove lower bounds on p(G), we
explicitly describe a simple coloring of the hypercube by assigning a particular color
to each color class. Then we analyze what color classes must be contained in the
shape sequence of any embedding of the graph G, and show it contains all colors. For
instance, here is a proof of the lower bound for Theorems 1 and 2:

2 ⌉ · l(e) + r(e) (mod q), where q = (d+1)2

Proof of Theorems 1 and 2, lower bound: Consider the simple coloring χ where
if d is odd, and q = d(d+2)
χ(e) = ⌈ d+1
2⌉th shape in the shape sequence for Qd is a ⌈ d+1
if d is even. Then the ⌈ d
2 ⌉ × ⌈ d
2⌉
parallelogram, and thus contains q color classes. The elements in each column in this
parallelogram contain ⌈ d+1
2 ⌉ consecutive colors (mod q), and no two columns of the
parallelogram share any colors, so this shape contains all q colors regardless of its

4

position in the grid of color classes. Thus any shape sequence corresponding to Qd
contains all colors.

4 Polychromatic Numbers for Punctured Cubes

We now use the techniques of Section 3 to determine p(G) for other subgraphs G of
the hypercube besides subcubes. In each case, we explicitly describe a simple coloring
to prove a lower bound on p(G), and examine possible shape sequences corresponding
to G and apply Lemma 5 to prove an upper bound.

We consider graphs which are obtained by deleting a vertex or edge from a hypercube.
We call such graphs punctured hypercubes or punctured cubes for short. Let Qd \ v
and Qd \ e denote the graphs obtained by deleting one vertex or one edge from Qd,
respectively. If d is odd we call these odd punctured cubes, and if d is even we call them
even punctured cubes. When embedding a punctured cube in a larger hypercube, we
can think of generating each embedding by ﬁrst embedding Qd, then deleting a given
vertex or edge from the embedded graph (not from the base graph of course). The
shape sequence corresponding to such an embedding depends on which vertex or edge
is deleted. Since an embedding of Qd in Qn can be represented as an n-bit vector with
d stars, we say that deleting the vertex corresponding to some d-bit string corresponds
to deleting from the embedding of Qd that vertex in Qn which replaces the d stars
with that given d-bit string. We also use the same notion for edges. For example, we
might consider the subgraph Q3 \ v ⊆ Q6 corresponding to the embedding [01*0**]
of Q3 with the vertex corresponding to [011] deleted, so the embedded subgraph will
not contain the vertex [010011] or any incident edges.

Proposition 7 If G is a subgraph of H, and both are subgraphs of the hypercube,
then p(G) ≤ p(H).
Corollary 8 For any d ≥ 2,

p(Qd−1) ≤ p(Qd \ v) ≤ p(Qd \ e) ≤ p(Qd).

Letting d = 2k when d is even, or d = 2k − 1 when d is odd, Theorem 2 states that
p(Q2k−1) = k2 and p(Q2k) = k2 + k. Thus Corollary 8 implies for odd punctured
cubes

k2 − k = p(Q2k−2) ≤ p(Q2k−1 \ v) ≤ p(Q2k−1 \ e) ≤ p(Q2k−1) = k2,

and for even punctured cubes

k2 = p(Q2k−1) ≤ p(Q2k \ v) ≤ p(Q2k \ e) ≤ p(Q2k) = k2 + k.

Figure 6: A shape sequence for Q4 \ v where v corresponds to [1111].

In the case of odd punctured cubes, we can determine the polychromatic number
exactly, while in the case of even punctured cubes, we give upper and lower bounds,
but we do not know the exact polychromatic number when 2k ≥ 6.
Lemma 9 For all d ≥ 2, p(Qd \ v) ≤ p(Qd) − 1.
Recall that the shape sequence corresponding to Qd is a sequence of d

If the vertex corresponding to [11 . . . 1] is

deleted from Qd, then the shape sequence corresponding to this embedding is identical
to the shape sequence for Qd except the single element in the dth row is deleted from
each parallelogram. For example, for Q4 \ v, the resulting shape sequence is shown in
Figure 6. Since the rest of the rows are not altered, the result follows from Lemma 5.

Theorem 10 For all k ≥ 2, p(Q2k−1 \ v) = p(Q2k−1 \ e) = k2 − 1.
Proof: By Corollary 8 it suﬃces to show that k2−1 ≤ p(Q2k−1\v) and p(Q2k−1\e) ≤
k2 − 1.
To prove the ﬁrst inequality, we show that the simple coloring χ : E(Qn) → [k2 − 1]
where χ(e) = k · l(e) + r(e) (mod k2 − 1) is (Q2k−1 \ v)-polychromatic.
The kth shape in the shape sequence for Q2k−1 is a k × k parallelogram. Since each
column in this parallelogram contains k consecutive colors (mod k2−1), and only the
ﬁrst and last columns in the parallelogram share any colors (the color at coordinate
(0,0) and the color at coordinate (k − 1, k − 1) are the same), this shape contains
all k2 − 1 colors. Since all the edges in the color classes in this parallelogram form a
matching, deleting a vertex can remove at most one edge in any of these color classes.
Every color class except the ones at coordinates (0,0), (k − 1, k − 1), (0, k − 1), and
(k − 1, 0) contains at least two edges, and since the colors at coordinates (0,0) and
(k − 1, k − 1) are the same, there are only four vertices which can be deleted from
Q2k−1 where in the corresponding shape sequence for Q2k−1 \ v the kth shape will not
contain all colors. In these vertices, the ﬁrst k − 1 entries are all 0’s or all 1’s, and
the last k − 1 entries are all 1’s or all 0’s, opposite from the ﬁrst k − 1 entries. The
kth entry can be 1 or a 0. For instance, if k = 3, the vertices in question correspond
to [00011], [11100], [00111], and [11000].
Since k(l + 1) + (r− 1)− (kl + r) = k− 1, and since (k− 1) divides k2− 1, the coloring
χ(e) = k· l(e) + r(e) (mod k2− 1) has the property that there are exactly k + 1 colors

(mod k − 1). Further, consecutive rows have colors in

in each row, each congruent
consecutive congruence classes. See Figures 7 and 8 for examples where k = 3.
Consider an embedding of Q2k−1 \ v and assume v is one of the four vertices where
the kth shape does not contain all colors. This choice of v deletes one color class from
the kth row of the kth shape. In the shape sequence for Q2k−1 \ v the colors in the
kth row are also found only in the ﬁrst and (2k− 1)th row. Without loss of generality
assume these colors are congruent to 0 (mod k − 1).
In the two cases where the kth entry of v is the same as the entries before it, the
(k − 1)st shape will remain intact (a (k + 1) × (k − 1) parallelogram). In the two
cases where the kth entry of v is the same as the entries after it, the (k + 1)st shape
will remain intact (a (k − 1) × (k + 1) parallelogram). Thus it suﬃces to show that
both of these parallelograms contain all colors congruent to 0 (mod k − 1). In the
(k − 1)st shape, a (k + 1) × (k − 1) parallelogram, the colors at coordinates (0,0),
(0, k − 1), (1, k − 2), . . ., (k − 2, 1), (k − 2, k) are (k + 1) consecutive multiples of k − 1
(mod k2−1). In the (k+1)st shape, the colors at coordinates (0,0), (k, k−2), (1, k−2),
(2, k − 3), . . ., (k − 1, 0) are (k + 1) consecutive multiples of k − 1 (mod k2 − 1).
Hence the coloring χ is (Q2k−1 \ v)-polychromatic, as claimed.
We now prove the inequality p(Q2k−1 \ e) ≤ k2 − 1. If the edge corresponding to the
edge with a star in the kth position, 0’s to the left and 1’s to the right (e.g. for k = 3,
e = [00*11]) is deleted, then a single color class in the kth row of the kth shape is
deleted from the shape sequence for Q2k−1 (Figure 9 shows the shape sequence for
k = 3). This reduces the maximum width of the shapes in the kth row by one, leaving
the other rows intact, and the inequality follows from Lemma 5.

We now turn our attention to even punctured cubes.
Theorem 11 p(Q4 \ v) = 5.
Proof: Since p(Q4) = 6, the upper bound follows from Lemma 9.
For the lower bound, we show that the simple coloring χ : E(Qn) → [5] where
χ(e) = 3 · l(e) + r(e) (mod 5) is (Q4 \ v)-polychromatic, see Figure 10. To see this,
note that the shape sequence for Q4 contains all ﬁve colors in both the second shape

and the third shape regardless of where those shapes appear. If a vertex other than one
corresponding to [0000], [1111], [0011], or [1100] is deleted, then the shape sequence
corresponding to Q4 \ v will have the second or third shape still intact, and thus be
polychromatic. If either of the ﬁrst two of these are deleted, then even though the
second shape will lose one element, it will still contain all ﬁve colors, and if either of
the last two are deleted, the same holds for the third shape.
Theorem 12 p(Q4 \ e) = 6.
Proof: Since p(Q4) = 6, the upper bound follows from Corollary 8.
For the lower bound, we show that the simple coloring χ : E(Qn) → [6] where
χ(e) = 4 · l(e) + r(e) (mod 6) is (Q4 \ e)-polychromatic, see Figure 11. Since deleting
an edge aﬀects at most one color class, it suﬃces to show that each color is present

in two shapes of the shape sequence for Q4. For this coloring, each row contains only
two colors, which are congruent
(mod 3), and adjacent rows contain consecutive
congruence classes.
In the four rows containing a shape sequence for Q4, the two
colors in the ﬁrst and fourth rows are the ﬁrst and third shapes, and the colors in the
two middle rows are in the second and third shapes.
Theorem 13 For all k ≥ 3, p(Q2k \ v) ≥ k2 + k − 2 = (k − 1)(k + 2).
Proof: We show that the simple coloring χ : E(Qn) → [(k − 1)(k + 2)] where
χ(e) = k · l(e) + r(e) (mod (k − 1)(k + 2)) is (Q4 \ v)-polychromatic. In this coloring,
each row only contains k + 2 colors, which are all congruent
(mod k − 1). Adjacent
rows contain colors in consecutive congruence classes.
First note that a k × (k + 1) parallelogram, the (k + 1)st shape in the shape sequence
for Q2k contains all colors. All color classes in this parallelogram except for the ones
at coordinates (0, 0), (k, 0), (0, k − 1), and (k, k − 1) have at least two parallel edges,
and thus deleting a vertex from Q2k will leave at least one edge in each of these color
classes. Further, the edges in the classes at coordinates (0, 0) and (k, k − 1) have the
same color. Thus the only four vertices which will cause this shape to lose a color
are those with ﬁrst k coordinates all 0 or all 1, and last k − 1 coordinates all 1 or all
0, opposite from the ﬁrst. For one of these vertices, if the ﬁrst k coordinates are all
1, the color class at coordinate (k, 0) is deleted. If the ﬁrst k coordinates are all 0,
the color class at coordinate (0, k − 1) is deleted. Without loss of generality, assume
that the color classes at coordinates (0, k − 1) and (k, 0) are in rows containing colors
congruent to 0 and 1 (mod k − 1) respectively. See Figure 12 for an example with
k = 4 and v = [11110000].
In either of these cases, the kth shape in the shape sequence for Q2k \ v must contain
the deleted color. In the kth shape, the color classes at coordinates (0, 0), (0, k − 1),
(1, k − 2), . . ., (k − 2, 1), (k − 2, k), and (k − 1, k − 1) contain k + 2 consecutive
multiples of k − 1 (mod (k − 1)(k + 2)) and thus contain all colors congruent to 0
(mod k−1). Similarly, the color classes at coordinates (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, k−1), (2, k−2),
. . ., (k− 1, 1), and (k− 1, k), contain k + 2 consecutive numbers (mod (k− 1)(k + 2))
that are congruent to 1 (mod k − 1) and thus contain all colors congruent to 1
(mod k − 1). None of these color classes can be deleted by deleting any of the four

Corollary 14 For all k ≥ 3,

• k2 + k − 2 ≤ p(Q2k \ e) ≤ k2 + k.

4.1 Open Problems

We conclude with some directions for future research on polychromatic edge colorings.

Problem 15 For which other graphs G can we determine p(G)?

A ﬁrst step might be to determine the polychromatic numbers for even punctured
cubes, starting with p(Q6\v) and p(Q6\e). If these polychromatic numbers are smaller
than the upper bounds given in Corollary 14, it would provide our ﬁrst example of
a polychromatic number not equal to the bound given by Lemma 5. In turn, such a
result might give insight into how Lemma 5 might be strengthened–for example, its
proof only uses horizontal translations, but shape sequences can be translated in any
direction–or whether other ideas are necessary.
Problem 16 For each r ≥ 2, is there some G s.t. p(G) = r?
It would be interesting even to
The smallest open case for Problem 16 is r = 7.
show that the gaps between polychromatic numbers are bounded.
It might also
be interesting to investigate whether (and under what circumstances) polychromatic
numbers can “jump.” In other words, if an edge is deleted from a graph G, by how
much can the polychromatic number of the resulting graph diﬀer from p(G)?

Bialostocki [3] proved that any subgraph of the hypercube not containing Q2 as a
subgraph and intersecting every Q2 has at most (n +√n)2n−2 edges. This implies for

15

large n, every Q2-polychromatic 2-coloring has approximately half the edges of each
color. Is it possible to generalize Bialostocki’s theorem?

Problem 17 For large n, given a G-polychromatic coloring of Qn with p(G) colors,
is it true that the proportion of edges in each color class must approach 1/p(G)?

5 Coloring Subcubes of Higher Dimension

Alon, Krech, and Szab´o [1] suggested a generalization of the problem of ﬁnding poly-
chromatic numbers on the hypercube where instead of edges (which themselves can
be thought of as one-dimensional hypercubes), subcubes of a ﬁxed dimension of the
hypercube are colored. Let pi(G) be the polychromatic number of the graph G if
Qi’s are colored, i.e. pi(G) is the largest number of colors with which it is possible
to color the Qi’s in any hypercube so that every embedding of G contains a Qi of
every color. To determine these polychromatic numbers, many of the ideas from edge
colorings can be directly generalized. However in Theorems 20 and 21 we show that
not everything about edge coloring generalizes in a straightforward way.

When Qi’s are colored, a simple coloring is one where the color of a Qi is determined
by the vector of length (i + 1) where the ﬁrst coordinate is the number of 1’s to the
left of the ﬁrst star, the (i + 1)st coordinate is the number of 1’s to the right of the
ith star, and for 1 < j < i + 1, the jth coordinate is the number of 1’s between
the (j − 1)st and jth stars. With this deﬁnition, a proof almost identical to that of
Lemma 3 (see ¨Ozkahya and Stanton [7]) gives the following generalization.
Lemma 18 Let k ≥ i ≥ 1 and G be a subgraph of Qk. If pi(G) = r, then there is a
simple G-polychromatic r-coloring of the Qi’s in Qk.

Thus we restrict our attention to simple colorings, and consider color classes in an
(i + 1)-dimensional grid. As with edge colorings, we refer to all Qi’s with the same
vector in a simple coloring as a color class. For example, the embedding [01110 ∗ 0 ∗
11 ∗ 01001 ∗ 11011] of Q4 in Q22 would be in color class (3, 0, 2, 2, 4). Deﬁne two color
classes in a (i + 1)-dimensional grid to be on the same level if their entries have the
same sum. Deﬁne a j1 × j2 × · · · × jl parallelepiped to be a set of color classes of the
following form: {(a1 + α1, a2 + α2, . . . , al + αl) : 0 ≤ αk < jk}. For the remainder of
the section, we restrict our attention to the case where G = Qd. Shape sequences for
Qd are characterized by the following generalization of Fact 6.
Fact 19 Let n ≥ d ≥ i ≥ 1. Every shape sequence for an embedding of Qd in Qn
consists of (cid:0)d
i(cid:1) shapes where each shape is a j1 × j2 × · · · × ji+1 parallelepiped where
j1 + j2 + · · · + ji+1 = d + 1, and each shape occupies the same d levels. The color
classes in each shape correspond to the Qi’s using the same set of i stars. Conversely,
every instance of such a shape sequence where the shapes are arranged in a proper
relative position corresponds to some embedding of Qd in Qn.

Figure 13: The six shapes for the embedding [1111 ∗ 011 ∗ 10110 ∗ 101 ∗ 001] of Q4 in
Q22.

For example, if Q2’s are colored, the embedding [1111 ∗ 011 ∗ 10110 ∗ 101 ∗ 001] of Q4
in Q22 contains 24 Q2’s, partitioned into (cid:0)4
2(cid:1) = 6 sets according to which two stars
they use. These six sets give rise to six shapes, all parallelepipeds containing color
classes in levels 12, 13, and 14 (see Figure 13).
¨Ozkahya and Stanton [7] proved lower bounds on pi(Qd) precisely analogous to those
in Theorem 1. Suppose the shape with the most elements in the shape sequence for
Qd contains r color classes. Then there is an r-coloring of the Qi’s where the largest
shape in the shape sequence contains all r colors for every copy of Qd. The number of
colors of this shape is the largest product of i + 1 natural numbers that sum to d + 1,
and is obtained by minimizing the diﬀerence between these numbers. The exact value
depends on the remainder of d + 1 (mod i + 1); if the remainder is zero, the number

¨Ozkahya and Stanton [7] also proved the upper bound analogous to Theorem 1, which

with d stars and all other entries 0. For example, if Q2’s are colored, the embedding of
Q3 represented by [***00000. . .] has Q2’s only in color classes (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0),

In the case of edge colorings, the polychromatic number for Qd turned out to be the
lower bound in Theorem 1, but this is not the case for colorings of larger subcubes;
the polychromatic number may be larger than the size of the largest shape. We
show this ﬁrst in the case of p2(Q3). All shapes in the shape sequence for Q3 when
Q2’s are colored have two elements, and the bounds corresponding to Theorem 1 are
2 ≤ p2(Q3) ≤ 4.
Theorem 20 p2(Q3) = 3.
Proof: Lower bound: Consider the simple 3-coloring χ that assigns colors to any
Q2 in color class (x1, x2, x3) the color χ(x1, x2, x3), where

χ(x1, x2, x3) =(x1 + x2 + x3

x1 + x2 + x3 + 1

(mod 3)
(mod 3)

if x2 ≡ 0
if x2 ≡ 1

(mod 2)
(mod 2).

Consider an embedding of Q3 where there are a1 1’s to the left of the ﬁrst star, a2 1’s
between the ﬁrst and second stars, a3 1’s between the second and third stars, and a4
1’s to the right of the third star. We show that it contains all three colors. Without
loss of generality assume a1 + a2 + a3 + a4 ≡ 0 (mod 3), and a1 = a4 = 0. For
1 ≤ i < j ≤ 3, denote by Sij the shape using stars i and j. The tables in Figure 14
list the color classes in each of the three shapes, and the colors in each shape for the
four possibilities for a2 and a3
(mod 2). For each possibility, each of the three colors
is in at least one of the three shapes.

Upper bound: A computer search found that no Q3-polychromatic 4-coloring, simple
or otherwise, is possible on Q5.

For a human-checkable proof, we know that if the Q2’s in Qn can be 4-colored so that
every Q3 is polychromatic, then it can be done with a simple coloring. We try to

18

construct a simple coloring χ on Q5, eventually showing that it is impossible.

The embedding [***00] of Q3 contains only color classes 000, 100, 010, and 001, so
these color classes must all be distinct, and without loss of generality we assign them
the colors 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.

To assign colors to the color classes 110, 101, 011, 200, 020, and 002, we examine
the embeddings [1***0], [*1**0], [**1*0], and [***10]. A straightforward but tedious
examination shows there are only ﬁve simple 4-colorings of the Q4 [****0], falling into
two patterns: One is χ1, below. The other four are χ2, where χ2(020) can be chosen
to be any color.

We now attempt to extend these colorings to the Q4’s [1****] and [****1]. In the case
of [1****], we already know the colors of 100, 200, 110, and 101, so the colors for the
color classes for [1****] must ﬁt one of the following four patterns. For i, j ∈ {1, 2},
χij is the coloring generated by extending the χi coloring with the χj pattern.

In the Q4 [****1], color classes 001, 101, 011, 002, 102, 111, and 201 are already
assigned. It is impossible to extend χ12 and χ22 consistent with the patterns χ1 or
χ2, while χ11 and χ21 extend uniquely as follows.

Now every color class except for 030 is assigned a color. However in either of the
colorings, the embedding [*1*1*] (containing color classes 110, 210, 020, 030, 011,
and 012) has at most two colors before 030 is assigned. Thus it cannot contain four
colors regardless of the choice for the color of 030.

Consider an embedding of Q4 where there are a1 1’s to the left of the ﬁrst star, a2 1’s
between the ﬁrst and second stars, a3 1’s between the second and third stars, a4 1’s
between the third and fourth stars, and a5 1’s to the right of the fourth star. We show
that it contains all ﬁve colors. Without loss of generality assume a1+a2+a3+a4+a5 ≡
0 (mod 5) and a1 = a5 = 0. For 1 ≤ i < j ≤ 4, denote by Sij the shape using stars i
and j. The following table lists the color classes in each of the six shapes.

Figure 15 lists the colors contained in each shape for the 27 possibilities for a2, a3,
and a4
(mod 3). For each possibility, each of the ﬁve colors is in at least one of the
six shapes.
Theorem 22 For all d ≥ i ≥ 1, j ≥ 1, pi+j(Qd+j) ≥ pi(Qd).
Proof:
d + j. Consider the k-coloring of the Qi+j’s in Qn given by

Suppose χ is a Qd-polychromatic k-coloring of the Qi’s in Qn, where n ≥

χ′(x1, x2, . . . , xi+1, . . . , xi+j+1) = χ(x1, x2, . . . , xi+1).

We show χ′ is Qd+j-polychromatic.
Let Gd+j be an embedding of Qd+j in Qn represented by an n-bit vector with d+j stars.
Let Gd be the embedding of Qd in Qn represented by the same vector with the (d+1)st
star and every coordinate to the right replaced by zeros. For example, if d = 4, j = 2,
and Gd+j = [0∗ 111∗ 1011∗∗110∗ 0∗ 01], then Gd = [0∗ 111∗ 1011∗∗11000000]. The
i + 1 coordinates of the color classes for Gd are identical to the ﬁrst i + 1 coordinates
of the color classes for Gd+j in the shapes that use the last j stars. Since χ is Qd-
polychromatic, Gd contains Qi’s of each of the k colors, and Gd+j must also contain
a Qi+j of each color with the coloring χ′.
Corollary 23 For all d ≥ 2, pd(Qd+1) ≥ p2(Q3) = 3.

Figure 15: The colors of the Q2’s contained in each shape for the 27 possibilities for
a2, a3, and a4 (mod 3) in an embedding of Q4, using the coloring χ from Theorem 21.

It is not clear whether the colorings in Theorems 20 and 21 have natural gener-
alizations, or whether they are sporadic small cases. Thus almost any progress in
determining polychromatic numbers when larger subcubes are colored would be in-
teresting.

Problem 24 Improve any of the following bounds:

• For d ≥ 3, d + 2 ≥ pd(Qd+1) ≥ 3.
• 10 ≥ p2(Q4) ≥ 5.
• For d ≥ 5, (cid:0)d+1

3 (cid:1) ≥ p2(Qd) ≥ p(Qd−1).
