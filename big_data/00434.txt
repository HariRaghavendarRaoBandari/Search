We report direct evidence of superﬂuidity in a quasi two-dimensional Bose gas by observing its
dynamical response to a collective excitation. Relying on a novel local correlation analysis, we are
able to probe inhomogeneous clouds and reveal their local dynamics. We identify in this way the
superﬂuid and thermal phases inside the gas and locate the boundary at which the Berezinskii-
Kosterlitz-Thouless crossover occurs. This new analysis also allows to evidence the coupling of
the two ﬂuids which induces at ﬁnite temperatures damping rates larger than the usual Landau
damping.

Superﬂuidity is one of the most fascinating expressions
of quantum mechanics at the macroscopic level. It man-
ifests itself through speciﬁc dynamical properties, giving
rise to collective eﬀects as diverse as quantized vortices
or second sound [1]. First observed in liquid helium [2],
superﬂuidity has also been shown to occur for polari-
tons in semi-conductor micro-cavities or weakly inter-
acting quantum gases [3]. Thanks to mature imaging
techniques and a high degree of control over their pa-
rameters, the latter have proven to be particularly well
suited for evidencing key features of superﬂuids: their
linear excitation spectrum at low momentum [4] as well
as the existence of a ﬁnite critical velocity have been ob-
served [5–7]. Moreover when set into rotation quantum
gases display vortices [8, 9] and present speciﬁc collec-
tive modes [10, 11]. Yet, extracting relevant information
from the dynamics of these systems still represents an
experimental challenge.

Properties of quantum gases are fully determined by
the knowledge of their density and temperature. Hence,
in order to explore diﬀerent physical regimes, these quan-
tities may have to be varied over a large range of val-
ues. While for homogeneous systems each repetition of
an experiment will address a single point of this phase
space, inhomogeneous quantum gases readily experience
diﬀerent regimes locally. This is the framework of the
local density approximation (LDA), which has been ex-
tensively exploited while exploring physics of quantum
gases at equilibrium. It has allowed for instance the de-
termination of the equation of state of a Fermi gas at
unitarity [12] and of a two-dimensional (2D) Bose gas
both in the weakly and strongly interacting regimes [13–
15]. In the same spirit, density ﬂuctuations of a quasi-
one-dimensional Bose gas have been described from the
quasi-condensate to the nearly ideal gas regime [16].

In this work, we extend this approach to the in situ
study of the dynamical properties of an inhomogeneous
quantum gas. We apply a novel local correlation anal-
ysis to probe the superﬂuidity of a quasi-2D Bose gas,
observing its response to the so-called scissors excita-
tion [11, 17]. It allows us to identify and locate the super-
ﬂuid and normal phases within the system. In addition,
at ﬁnite temperature we evidence a collisional coupling

between them. In a sense, our scheme relying on the weak
global excitation of a gas close to equilibrium probed
locally is symmetric to the recent measurement of the
critical velocity in an inhomogeneous quasi-2D Bose gas,
where the eﬀect of a strong local perturbation is probed
through a global observable, the total heat deposited over
the whole cloud [7].

The reduction to low dimensions strongly aﬀects the
physics of the collective properties of a quantum sys-
tem [18, 19]. In particular, in two dimensions, thermal
phase ﬂuctuations destroy long range order [20] and pre-
vent the occurrence of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC)
in a homogeneous Bose gas at any ﬁnite temperature [21].
On the other hand, these systems undergo a Berezinskii-
Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase transition to a super-
ﬂuid state [22–24]. This still holds for quantum gases
conﬁned in harmonic traps [25] as evidenced experimen-
tally for quasi-2D Bose gases through the algebraic decay
of their phase coherence [26]. Here, we directly locate the
boundary where the superﬂuid fraction vanishes across
the BKT crossover through local correlation analysis.

The starting point for our experiments is a partially
degenerate Bose gas of 87Rb atoms produced in a radio-
frequency (rf) dressed quadrupole trap [27], loaded from
an hybrid trap [28]. For our experimental parameters
the measured vertical trapping frequency ωz = 2π ×
1.83(1) kHz is much larger than the in-plane trapping fre-
quencies ωx = 2π × 33.8(2) Hz and ωy = 2π × 48.0(2) Hz,
resulting in a pancake shaped atomic cloud. The trap
in-plane geometry, deﬁned by the direction of the eige-
naxes (x, y) and the anisotropy ǫ = (ω2
y−ω2
x) =
0.34(5), is controlled by the rf polarization.

We prepare diﬀerent samples by varying the total atom
number and temperature. As both the temperature kBT
and the chemical potential µ are comparable to the ver-
tical oscillator energy level spacing ¯hωz, the system is in
the quasi-2D regime, and the eﬀective dimensionless 2D
interaction constant is ˜g = √8πa/ℓz = 0.1056(3) [29],
where a is the scattering length, ℓz = p¯h/(mωz) the
vertical harmonic oscillator length and m the atomic
mass. For most of our datasets the fraction of atoms
out of the vertical oscillator groundstate is smaller than
20 %, despite the relatively high temperatures and chem-

FIG. 1. (color online) Principle of the experiment studied in
this work. (a) A quasi-2D sample (blue shaded ellipse) is pre-
pared in an anisotropic harmonic trap (dashed axes), and at
t = 0 the trap axes are rotated by θ ≃ 10◦. (b) For t > 0,
the cloud shape oscillates in the rotated trap (solid axes):
the scissors mode is excited. (c) Examples of the evolution
with holding time of the average hxyi over the in situ atomic
density distribution, for an almost purely degenerate sam-
ple (α = 0.78(18), open blue triangles) and a non-degenerate
sample (α = 0.09(2), ﬁlled red squares), together with the cor-
responding ﬁts (black solid lines). Each point is an average
of two measurements. A constant oﬀset has been subtracted
from the ﬁrst dataset for the sake of clarity.

ical potentials[30] (with respect to ¯hωz = h × 1830 Hz =
kB × 88 nK). Therefore the system is well described by
coupled 2D manifolds and exhibits 2D physics. Speciﬁ-
cally, the BKT transition is expected to occur in our trap
at a phase space density Dc = 8.188(3) for a reduced
chemical potential αc = µ/(kBT ) = 0.162(1) [31]. These
critical values increase slightly when the eﬀect of the pop-
ulation in the transverse excited states at kBT >
∼ ¯hωz is
taken into account [32]. The samples are prepared with
a reduced chemical potential α in the range [0.09− 0.88],
on both sides of the expected threshold [30].
We excite the scissors oscillations by suddenly chang-
ing the orientation of the horizontal conﬁnement axes by
θ ≃ 10◦, while keeping the trap frequencies constant [33],
see ﬁgure 1(a). The superﬂuid and thermal fractions of
the cloud are subsequently expected to oscillate at diﬀer-
ent frequencies: ω± = |ωx ± ωy| for a normal gas close to
the collisionless regime and ωhd = qω2
y for the su-
perﬂuid [11]. We typically record one hundred in situ pic-
tures of the atoms after diﬀerent holding times, spanning
about 200 ms. In order to study the scissors mode at ﬁ-
nite temperature, it is essential to be able to discriminate
between the superﬂuid and thermal phases [34]. However
a direct ﬁt of the 2D in situ density proﬁles by a bi-modal
function is quite imprecise because the typical width over
which they extend are comparable.

x + ω2

Inspired by the theoretical works which use the aver-
age hxyi as an observable of the scissors mode excita-

2

x

tion [11, 35, 36], we use an eﬃcient algorithm to extract
hxyi from our data [30]. For all of our datasets hxyi
presents damped oscillations as illustrated in ﬁgure 1(c).
In order to quantitatively analyze this signal, we take
advantage of the classical description of the scissors os-
cillations [11]. In this framework the complex oscillation
frequencies ω of hxyi are parametrized by a characteristic
relaxation time τ :

i

τ

(ω2 − ω2

hd) + (ω2 − ω2

(1)

In the hydrodynamic limit where τ vanishes, this model
also describes the scissors mode in a superﬂuid [11]. Ap-
plying this prediction to our data, we are able to ﬁt [30]
the value of τ and deduce the frequencies ωsc and damp-
ing rates Γsc of the oscillations relying on the constraints
of equation (1).
In this way, we perform a double fre-
quency ﬁt with only three parameters (amplitude, oﬀset
and τ ). The model always predicts two frequencies, cor-
responding to an upper branch and a lower branch. The
former spans frequencies in the range [ωhd, ω+] while the
latter spans [0, ω−]. We found this method to be more
accurate than a ﬁt to a sum of two damped cosines which
requires at least nine free parameters, in particular for the
determination of the lowest, highly damped, frequency.
We checked that the ﬁt constrained by equation (1) intro-
duces no bias and that both models give the same results
[30].

Figure 2 reports the frequencies found as a function
of the reduced chemical potential α. Below the BKT
transition (α < αc, leftmost point of the graph), the
two frequencies are very close to, but slightly below, the
classical prediction ω±. This, together with the large ob-
served damping rates (see ﬁgure 1(c)), indicates that the
gas is not fully in the collisionless regime, which would
require ωscτ ≫ 1 [11]. For samples above the BKT tran-
sition (α > αc) we ﬁnd either a single frequency close to
ωhd or two frequencies, shifted below the collisionless fre-
quencies ω±. Our data are consistent with an increase of
the upper frequency from ωhd to ω+ when α decreases,
in agreement with 2D dynamical classical ﬁeld simula-
tions [36], and in stark contrast with what was observed
in three-dimensional experiments [34]. We note however
that the simple criterion based on the critical value αc
is not suﬃcient to describe our datasets:
in particular
the thermal frequencies ω± are still observable beyond
α = αc. The global hxyi observable therefore fails to
evidence the normal to superﬂuid crossover. Indeed, in
these conditions the superﬂuid and normal phases coex-
ist in the trap and the simple picture of equation (1)
does not capture all the dynamics. Moreover, as the ob-
servable hxyi is computed over the whole sample, both
phases are combined in the total signal and it is diﬃcult
to isolate their respective signature.

In order to overcome this issue we introduce the con-
cept of local correlation analysis. In the spirit of LDA, we
deﬁne the rescaled radius ¯r = p(ωx/ωy)x2 + (ωy/ωx)y2,
following a 2D isodensity path around the trap center.

FIG. 2. (color online) Measured oscillation frequencies as a
function of the reduced chemical potential α = µ/(kBT ). The
open blue circles correspond to the upper frequency branch,
the ﬁlled red diamonds to the lower frequency branch, see text
for detail. The three horizontal lines indicate the expected fre-
quencies in the low/high temperature limits: ωhd/(2π) (solid
line), ω+/(2π) (dashed) and ω−/(2π) (dash-dotted). The ver-
tical red solid line indicates the estimated position of the BKT
transition αc = 0.162(1) for a 2D Bose gas with our trap pa-
rameters [31]. The error bars are the standard deviations
estimated using the ﬁt residuals.

We compute a partial average hxyirc evaluated by in-
cluding only the pixels at a rescaled distance ¯r < rc. In
this way we expect to isolate the superﬂuid phase which
is located at smaller ¯r.

Figure 3 presents the frequencies found as a function
of the cut-oﬀ radius rc, for three of the datasets. Below
a cutoﬀ radius of rc ≃ 10 µm there is no clear oscillation
(indicated by the large error bars). This reﬂects the fact
that the scissors excitation is a surface mode and does
not aﬀect the core of the cloud. Beyond this cutoﬀ ra-
dius, we observe in most of the datasets a central region
oscillating at a single frequency, in good agreement with
the hydrodynamic prediction ωhd, which was not appar-
ent in the global analysis. For larger radii, we recover
the results of the global analysis, showing that the con-
tribution of the central region to the total signal is small,
even if the density is higher at the center. The radius
at which the crossover between these two regimes occurs
depends on α. As discussed below, this result is a di-
rect evidence of the coexistence of normal and superﬂuid
scissors excitations at ﬁnite temperature in our system.
To get more accurate results, we reduce further the re-
gion of interest to a thin annulus centered on ¯r = ra, with
a width δr = 4 pixels, thus probing an isodensity region
of the cloud. Figure 4 displays the frequencies measured
for this partial average hxyira as a function of ra, for
α = 0.73(3), corresponding to one of the datasets of ﬁg-

ure 3. The larger error bars result from a smaller number
of pixels involved in the average. This local analysis is
even more sensitive to frequency shifts and allows a more
accurate determination of the position of the boundary
between the two phases at ¯r ≃ 22 µm.
We attribute the hydrodynamic part of the gas present
at the center to the superﬂuid phase of the degenerate
quasi-2D Bose gas. One may wonder if a hydrodynamic
classical gas at high density could explain our observa-
tion. From the independent measurement of the equilib-
rium values of µ and T , we evaluate the scaled distance
from the trap center at which the reduced local chem-
ical potential α(¯r) = µloc(¯r)/(kBT ), where µloc(¯r) =
µ − mωxωy ¯r2/2, reaches the critical value for the BKT
transition [32]. This is indicated by the vertical red solid
line in ﬁgure 4, in good agreement with our observed
crossover. The small discrepancy could be explained in
two ways. First, close to the critical radius, the ﬁnite
extension δr of our local probe averages the signal over

to the upper branch, (b) to the lower branch. The error bars

The grey shaded areas indicate the low signal to noise ratio

The two vertical lines are estimates of the boundary between

and on the local collision time (dashed magenta), see text for
details.

both the superﬂuid and normal regions. Second, ﬁnite
size eﬀects for a trapped cloud, away from the thermody-
namic limit, modify the position of the expected bound-
ary anyway. Indeed, a Quantum Monte Carlo simulation
of a quasi two-dimensional trapped Bose gas with our
parameters[37] has shown that the normal to superﬂuid
crossover is broadened by about 2 µm in the sample, re-
sulting in a non zero superﬂuid fraction beyond the crit-
ical radius predicted by the LDA. We are thus conﬁdent
that we observe the superﬂuid to classical transition sig-
nature in the dynamical response of the gas.

We now come to the interpretation of the local relax-
ation time τ (ra) deduced from the local analysis. We
ﬁnd that its value is in good agreement with the inverse
of the local collision rate Γc(ra) ≃ n2D(ra)˜g2¯h/m eval-
uated in the conﬁnement dominated three-dimensional
regime [38], where n2D(ra) is the measured average 2D
density on the annulus. This supports the use of equa-
tion (1) to describe the local dynamics. We point out
that our analysis could give access to a local relaxation
time of the excitation, a key ingredient in ﬁnite temper-

4

ature two-ﬂuids models [39, 40].

Conversely we use the measured τ (ra) to estimate
the local collision rate and hence the local phase space
density, knowing the sample temperature. The verti-
cal dashed magenta line in ﬁgure 4 indicates the radius
at which this estimated local phase space density be-
comes higher than the BKT critical phase space density
Dc = 11.2 computed for this quasi-2D gas [32]. The
analysis of the dynamics thus conﬁrms the location of
the boundary between the superﬂuid and normal phases.
We now turn to a quantitative analysis of the damping
rates Γsc of the local correlations. We will only consider
the upper frequency branch, sketched on ﬁgure 5(a), as
the lower frequency is highly damped in our experiments.
In order to get a reliable estimate of the frequency and
damping rates of the scissors oscillation for both the cen-
tral and outer regions, we exclude the crossover area and
compute the hxyi averages over a disc for the central part
and over a large annulus for the outer part, as illustrated
on ﬁgure 5(c). Figure 5(b) compares the measured re-
duced damping rate of the scissors oscillations Γsc/ωsc to
the reduced Landau damping ΓL/ωsc [41, 42]:

where c = p2µ/(3m) is the sound velocity for a pancake-
shaped Bose gas [43]. For our coldest samples the mea-
sured damping rate for the superﬂuid phase is close to
the damping predicted by equation (2). However for the
datasets with a large thermal fraction, the damping in
the superﬂuid phase deviates from the predicted Landau
damping and is of the same order of magnitude than the
damping in the normal phase, suggesting that this addi-
tional damping originates from collisional coupling to the
normal gas [39]. The reduced damping rate in the normal
phase is approximately constant for all our datasets. We
note that in our 2D geometry the abnormal damping can-
not be explained by a resonant Beliaev coupling to other
modes as observed in three-dimensional experiments [44].
In conclusion we have studied the dynamics of a quasi-
2D Bose gas near the BKT transition. We have shown
the coexistence of a superﬂuid fraction and a thermal
part by a direct, in situ, local analysis of its dynamical
behavior. We use the frequency of the scissors mode as
a local probe of superﬂuidity. Whereas a global analy-
sis of the data fails to reveal the coexistence of the su-
perﬂuid and normal oscillations, we demonstrate a new
local correlation analysis, reminiscent of the local den-
sity approximation, which allows to locate the normal
to superﬂuid transition, using a purely dynamical crite-
rion. The position of the boundary is in good agreement
with the crossover expected from the equilibrium prop-
erties of the gas. In principle it should be possible with
this local probe to observe the superﬂuid density jump
at the BKT transition [24, 45]. This motivates future
numerical studies of ﬁnite temperature dynamics to es-
tablish quantitatively the relation between local scissors
frequency and local superﬂuid fraction.

Local correlation analysis could also be applied to nu-
merical simulations. In particular, the local measurement
of relaxation times would be useful to compare exper-
iments to numerical calculations at ﬁnite temperature.
We expect this new kind of local diagnosis to shed new
light on the study of out-of-equilibrium systems.

The determination of the equilibrium properties of the
cloud follows the approach described in reference [46].
Prior to the excitation we take an in situ picture of the
atoms at rest in the initial trap using a low intensity
(I ∼ 0.7Isat) imaging pulse, to recover correctly the low
density proﬁle of the thermal wings. We then adjust this
density proﬁle by a self consistently determined Hartree-
Fock mean ﬁeld model including up to ten excited states
manifolds. From this procedure we deduce the chem-
ical potential µ and temperature T of the cloud [46].
The total atom number and detection eﬃciency are cal-
ibrated independently using an auxiliary time of ﬂight
imaging system observing the atoms at lower density
from the side [28]. The equilibrium parameters for the
diﬀerent datasets are summarized in table I. The num-
ber of atoms in the groundstate of the vertical harmonic
oscillator N0z is estimated from the values of the chemi-
cal potential and temperature using an hybrid Thomas-
Fermi plus Hartree-Fock mean ﬁeld model that allows to
compute the populations in the ﬁrst ten vertical oscilla-
tor manifolds. Since a majority of the atoms are in the
groundstate the system is in the quasi two-dimensional
regime.

After the excitation, we record the atomic density after
a variable delay time using a saturating imaging pulse
(I ∼ 8Isat) [47]. We are thus able to resolve both the low
density thermal wings of the cloud and the high density
degenerate core. Our home-made imaging system has a
resolution of 4 µm and an eﬀective pixel size of 0.95 µm

FIG. 6. (color online) Data histogram (white bars) of a single
picture of 121 × 121 pixels (see inset). The red solid line is a
Gaussian ﬁt to the background distribution, and the vertical
blue dashed line is the estimated signal threshold.

in object space.

In order to compute the relevant density weighted av-
erage values hxi, hyi, hx2i, hy2i and hxyi, it is necessary
to remove the imaging noise which does not correspond
to real atomic signal. We proceed as follows. For a square
picture, and a small ellipsoidal cloud, about half the pix-
els do not represent atoms and therefore contain infor-
mation only about the noise. This appears clearly if one
plots the histogram of the picture, as we do in ﬁgure 6.
We identify a large contribution due to the background,
with a low value of signal, and a smaller contribution
due to the data, at larger signal values. From a Gaus-
sian ﬁt to the background contribution, we estimate a
signal threshold (2.5σ of the Gaussian) above which we
can neglect the noise. We then cancel the contribution of
all pixels having a value lower than the threshold. Note
that this process also ﬁlters a few relevant pixels, but it
greatly improves the signal to noise ratio. We checked
that the results are insensitive to the exact position of
the threshold.

After this noise removal procedure, we compute the
values of hx′i, hy′i, hx′2i, hy′2i and hx′y′i for each picture,
where x′ and y′ are the coordinates of the pixels in the
camera frame. By adjusting the two-dimensional center
of mass motion of the cloud we ﬁnd the trap frequencies,
the trap center, and the orientation of the axes relative to
the camera. Then by combining with appropriate weights
the second order moments we extract the hxyi values in
the trap frame.

B. Scissors mode classical model

In this section we describe the ﬁtting procedure used
in the main paper to extract the frequencies and relax-

using the model derived from equations (3), ﬁlled red squares
are obtained using a sum of two damped cosines model. The
error bars are the standard deviations estimated using the ﬁt
residuals. The black solid line is the upper branch predicted
using equation (1). For the sake of clarity only the data points

We denote fτ (t) = hxyi(t) the solution of equations (3)
with initial conditions: fτ (0) = hxyi0 (an arbitrary non
zero value), hyvx ± xvyit=0 = 0 and hvxvyit=0 = 0.
We use the time-dependent function g(τ, A, B) : t 7→
Afτ (t) + B as a model to ﬁt our experimental data, with
A, B and τ as free real parameters. For small values
of τ this model is close to a damped cosine, with fre-
quency ω ≃ ωhd = qω2
y, while for large values of
τ this model is close to a sum of two damped cosines
with frequencies close to ω± = |ωx ± ωy|. In both cases
the damping depends on the exact value of τ . Once we
have determined the value of τ from the ﬁt, we solve
equation (1) of the main paper to ﬁnd the corresponding
frequency and damping rate.

x + ω2

Figure 7 displays the damping rates and frequencies
found for diﬀerent radii ra for the same dataset as in ﬁg-
ure 4, using two ﬁtting methods: the one described above
and a simple sum of two damped cosines. Both models
give results close to the prediction of equation (1) (con-
sidering the error bars). As mentioned before the former
model has been derived from the predictions of equa-
tion (1) and therefore the points must fall near the theo-

retical curve. However the latter model do not make any
kind of assumption constraining the relative values of the
damping rate and the frequency and yet agrees with the
same theoretical prediction. Therefore we conclude that
equation (1) quantitatively describes the scissors oscilla-
tions found with our local correlation analysis scheme.
Using our model ﬁt enables to reduce the error bars and
thus to extract the low frequency branch from the noise.
