Abstract

In this paper we present a new mathematical rigorous technique for computing the average free
energy of a disordered system with quenched randomness, using the replicas. The basic tool of
this technique is a distributional zeta-function, a complex function whose derivative at the origin
yields the average free energy of the system as the sum of two contributions: the ﬁrst one is a series
in which all the integer moments of the partition function of the model contribute; the second one,
which can not be written as a series of the integer moments, can be made as small as desired. This
result supports the use of integer moments of the partition function, computed via replicas, for
expressing the average free energy of the system. One advantage of the proposed formalism is that
it does not require the understanding of the properties of the permutation group when the number
of replicas goes to zero. Moreover, the symmetry is broken using the saddle-point equations of
the model. As an application for the distributional zeta-function technique, we obtain the average
free energy of the disordered λϕ4 model deﬁned in a d-dimensional Euclidean space.

Introduction

Disordered systems have been investigated for decades in statistical mechanics [1–5], condensed
matter, gravitational physics [6–11] and even number theory [12]. The physics of spin glasses, dis-
ordered electronic systems and directed polymers in random media are well known examples of
such systems. In statistical mechanics, the disorder may signiﬁcantly aﬀect critical behavior of
diﬀerent systems [13]. An example of a system with disorder is the random ﬁeld Ising model [14],
whose hamiltonian is analogous to the one of the classical Ising model, but allowing for a quenched
random magnetic ﬁeld. This model can be analyzed using a continuous description, instead of
dealing with discrete elements. The continuous model is obtained in the limit of zero lattice spac-
ing. In this case, the hamiltonian of the discrete model can be replaced by an eﬀective hamiltonian
of the Landau-Ginzburg model, where the order parameter is a continuous ﬁeld coupled with a
quenched random ﬁeld. This continuous model has been extensively studied using statistical ﬁeld
theory methods (e.g., [15–23]). The main problem of this disordered system is that a given re-
alization of disorder is not invariant by translation and the correlation functions are not similar
to the ones of transitionally invariant systems. Also, in the presence of disorder, ground state
conﬁgurations of the scalar ﬁeld are deﬁned by a saddle-point equations and the solutions of such
equation depend on particular conﬁgurations of the random ﬁeld. Due to the presence of these
local minima, it is very diﬃcult to implement a perturbative approach in a straightforward way.
An established procedure to circumvented the above discussed problem is to average some
thermodynamic extensive quantity with respect to the probability distribution of the disorder.
From a disordered system, where all the correlation functions are not translational invariant, av-
eraging on the disorder one obtains a system where the correlation functions are translational
invariant. However, this procedure is not always straightforward. For quenched disorder, one is
mainly interested in averaging the free energy over the disorder, which amounts to averaging the
log of the partition function Z. A well know technique for computing the average free energy is
the replica method [24] based in results discussed in Ref. [25]. In this approach, a new system
deﬁned by k statistically independent replicas is introduced and the limit k → 0 is taken.
In
this process, one has to understand the behavior of the symmetry group Sk as k → 0. Moreover,
special procedures are sometimes required for obtaining sound physical results. For example, the
average free energy of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model [26], which is the inﬁnite-range version
of the Edwards-Anderson model, exhibits a (problematic) negative entropy at low temperatures,
assuming a replica symmetric solution. The scheme of replica symmetry breaking was introduced
to avoid this unphysical result. A step further was introduced by Parisi with another replica
symmetry breaking solution, still using the replica formalism [27–29], by choosing a suitable ul-
trametric parametrization of the replica matrix in the computation of the average free energy.
See also the Ref. [30]. This scheme describes many stable states with ultrametric structure in the
phase space, in which the low-temperature phase consists of inﬁnitely many pure thermodynamic
states.

Despite the success in the application of the replica method in disordered systems, some authors
consider that a mathematical rigorous derivation to support this procedure is still lacking [31–34].

1

It is therefore natural to ask whether there exists a mathematically rigorous method, based on
the use of replicas, for computing the average free energy of systems with quenched disorder.
In Ref. [35], Dotsenko considered an alternative approach where the summation of all integer
moments of the partition function is used to evaluate the average free energy of the random
energy model [36]. Also in Ref. [37] a replica calculation using only the integer moments of the
partition function have been considered. Some alternative approaches to the replica method are
the dynamical approach [38] and the cavity method [39]. In the Ref. [40], the main concepts and
methods of the cavity method is discussed.

In this paper we deﬁne a new mathematical object associated with systems with quenched
disorder, namely, a complex function which, due to its similarities with zeta-functions, we will
call distributional zeta-function. We will show that the derivative of this function at the origin,
which is well and uniquely deﬁned, yields the average free energy of the underlying system with
quenched disorder. Unlike the standard replica method, this procedure does not require derivation
with respect to the (integer) moments of the partition function. Moreover, in our derivation
the average free energy of the random λϕ4 model is given by a series in which all the replicas
contribute. This method is closely related to the use of spectral zeta-functions for evaluating the
determinant of diﬀerential operators of diﬀerent systems in Euclidean ﬁeld theory [41–45] and
for computing the renormalized vacuum energy of quantum ﬁeld in the presence of boundaries.
Although diﬀerent global methods can be used to obtain the Casimir energy of quantum ﬁelds,
as for example an exponential cut-oﬀ or an analytic regularization procedure [46–48], the spectral
zeta-function method is powerful, elegant and widely used in quantum ﬁeld theory [49].

The organization of this paper is as follows. In section II we discuss the replica ﬁeld theory
obtained from a quenched disordered ﬁeld linearly coupled to the Euclidean scalar ﬁeld. In section
III we introduce the distributional zeta-function and compute the derivative of the distributional
zeta-function at the origin in order to obtain the average free energy of the system with quenched
disorder. Conclusions are given in section IV. In the appendix we brieﬂy review the use of the
spectral zeta-function method in Euclidean ﬁeld theory. We use  = c = kB = 1.

2 The replica ﬁeld theory for the disordered scalar model

Our aim is to use the Euclidean formalism of ﬁeld theory to discuss classical statistical systems
with disorder. We study a ﬁeld theory with ﬂuctuations around the mean ﬁeld solution. Let us
assume, for simplicity, that we have only a quenched disordered ﬁeld linearly coupled to a Euclidean
massive scalar ﬁeld.
In this case, one must obtain average values of extensive quantities. An
establish technique for computing the average free energy is the replica method, which we brieﬂy
describe. The key point of this method is to compute integer moments of the partition function
E Z k and to use such information to calculate E ln Z. The replica method consists in the following
steps. First, one constructs the (integer) k-th power of the partition function Z k = Z×Z ×...×Z,
and interprets it as the partition function of a new system, formed of k statistically independent
copies of the original system. Second, the expected value of the partition function’s k-th power

2

Zk = E Z k is computed by integrating over the disorder ﬁeld on the new model. Finally, the
average free energy is obtained using the formula E ln Z = limk→0
, where Zk for 0 < k < 1
is derived from its values for k integer. Note that in Zk, integration over the disorder ﬁeld yields
a system deﬁned by k replicas which are no more statistically independent. The average value
of the free energy in the presence of the quenched disorder is then obtained in the limit of a
zero-component ﬁeld theory, taking the limit k → 0. Therefore, in this procedure it is necessary
to understand the properties of the permutation group Sk, when k → 0.
We start with the usual λϕ4 Euclidean scalar ﬁeld theory in the presence of a disorder ﬁeld
h(x). In this setting, the functional integral Z(h) is deﬁned by [50]:

Zk−1

Z(h) =Z [dϕ] exp(cid:18)−S +Z ddx h(x)ϕ(x)(cid:19) ,

and

The term S0 is the free ﬁeld action while SI, a non-Gaussian contribution, deﬁnes the interacting

part. In Eq. (1), [dϕ] is a functional measure, formally given by [dϕ] = Qx dϕ(x). The terms
g0 and m2
0 are, respectively, the bare coupling constant and the bare mass square of the model.
The term h(x) is a quenched random ﬁeld. A normalization factor appears in the deﬁnition
of the gaussian functional integral, N = (det(−∆ + m2
2 , but in the following, as usual, we
0))
are absorbing this normalization factor in the functional measure. The symbol ∆ denotes the
Laplacian in Rd.

One comment is in order. In the above formal functional integral formulation there are two
kinds of random variables. The ﬁrst one are the Euclidean ﬁelds ϕi(x). These ﬁelds describes
0)−1| yi.
generalized random processes with zero mean and covariance G0(x− y, m0) = h x|(−∆ + m2
The second one, are the disordered ﬁeld h(x), in which the the absence of any gradient either makes
them statistically independent in every point of the domain or, for ﬁelds that are not statistically
independent for diﬀerent points of the domain, the two-point correlation function is not deﬁned in
terms of gradients. We call these as uncorrelated and correlated disordered ﬁelds, respectively. We
assume that the random variables characterizing the disorder exhibit no long-range correlations,
therefore the probability distribution is written as

P (h) = p0 exp −

1

2 σ Z ddx(h(x))2!.

(4)

The quantity σ is a small positive parameter associated with the disorder and p0 is a normalization
constant. In this case we have a delta correlated random ﬁeld, with two-point correlation function
E(h(x)h(y)) = σδd(x − y). In the next paragraph, we will obtain the replica partition function,
E Z k, for this disordered model.
Let us construct Z k = Z × Z × ... × Z. We interpret Z k as the partition function of a new
system, formed from k statistically independent copies of the original system. We have that the
partition function Z k of the replicated system is

The ﬁrst term in the right hand side of Eq. (21) is the bare contribution to the connected two-point
correlation function; the second term is the contribution to the disconnected two-point correlation
function, which becomes connected after averaging the disorder. The ﬁrst term is characteristic
of pure systems and the additional term, which becomes a squared Lorentzian term (for k → 0),
appears in these random ﬁeld systems [51, 52].
In the next section we present a mathematical rigorous technique for computing the average
free energy of a disordered system with quenched randomness using the integer moments of the
partition function, without taking the limit of these integers to zero. The basic tool of this method
is a complex function that we call the distributional zeta-function.

3 The distributional zeta-function in disordered systems

The purpose of this section is to present an alternative method to calculate the average free
energy of a system with quenched disorder, using the replicas. Let M be a Euclidean manifold.
The fundamental objects here are the ﬁelds, a space C ∞(M, R) of smooth functions on M. Let
S : C ∞(M, R) → R be an action functional. The Euclidean action functional associated with the
model with disorder degrees of freedom can be written as

S(h, ϕ) =Z ddx(cid:18) 1

ϕ(x)(cid:16)−∆ + m2

0(cid:17)ϕ(x) +

λ
4!

ϕ4(x) − h(x)ϕ(x)(cid:19).

(22)

Again, the symbol ∆ denotes the Laplacian in Rd. The h-dependent free energy F (h) is given by

F (h) = ln Z [dϕ] exp(cid:18)−S +Z ddx h(x)ϕ(x)(cid:19) ,

(23)

6

where, as above speciﬁed, S is the action including S0 and SI, i.e., the free and interaction
contributions. The average free energy Fq is deﬁned as

Recall that h is a random variable with probability distribution dρ[h] = d[h]P (h) with d[h] =

Fq =Z dρ[h] F (h).

(24)

Qx dh(x). Direct use of these deﬁnitions yields

Fq =Z d[h]P (h) ln Z(h).

(25)

On way to compute the average free energy is to use the standard replica method, brieﬂy
discussed in the previous section. Here we propose an alternative procedure to ﬁnd the average
free energy by means of a distributional zeta-function. Observe that if (X,A, µ) is a measure space
and f : X → (0,∞) is measurable, one can deﬁne a generalized ζ-function

ζ µ,f (s) =ZΩ

f (x)−s dµ(x)

(26)

for those s ∈ C such that f −s ∈ L1(µ), where in the above integral f −s = exp(−s log(f )) is
obtained using the principal branch of the logarithm. This formalism encompasses some well-
known instances of zeta-functions for f (x) = x: if X = N and µ the counting measure we retrieve
the Riemann zeta-function [53, 54]; instead, if µ counts only the prime numbers, we retrieve the
prime zeta-function [55, 56] ﬁnally, if X = R and µ counts the eigenvalues of an elliptic operator,
with their respective multiplicity, we obtain the spectral zeta-function [43]. Further extending
this formalism to the case where f (h) = Z(h) and dµ(h) = d[h]P (h) leads to the deﬁnition of the
distributional zeta-function Φ(s),

Φ(s) =Z d[h]P (h)

1

Z(h)s

(27)

for s ∈ C, this function being deﬁned in the region where the above integral converges. We will
reproduce the steps of the use of the spectral zeta-function for computing functional determinants
in ﬁeld theory, proving that Φ(s) is well deﬁned for Re(s) ≥ 0, that Fq = −(d/ds)Φ(s)|s=0 and
using this equality for computing a series approximation for the average free energy Fq.
Let us prove that Φ(s) is deﬁned for Re(s) ≥ 0. Since S0 and SI given by Eqs. (2) and (3) are

even (as functions of ϕ), Z(h) = Z(−h) = (Z(h) + Z(−h))/2 and

Z(h) =Z [dϕ] exp (−S) cosh(cid:18)Z ddx h(x)ϕ(x)(cid:19) .

(28)

7

Hence Z(h) ≥ Z(0) and, for Re(s) ≥ 0, we have

Z d[h]P (h)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

1

Z(h)s(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

≤Z d[h]P (h)

1

Z(0)Re(s) =

1

Z(0)Re(s) < ∞.

(29)

Therefore, the integral in Eq. (27) is well deﬁned in the half complex plane Re(s) ≥ 0 and Φ is
also deﬁned in this region, without resorting to analytic continuations.

Since −(d/ds)Z(h)−s|s=0 + = ln Z(h)1, we can write

Fq = −Z d[h]P (h)

d
ds

1

Z(h)s|s=0 + = −

d

Φ(s)|s=0 +,

(30)

where the second equality is justiﬁed by the fact that Z(h) ≥ Z(0) and an application of Lebesgue’s
dominated convergence theorem, if we interpret d[h]P (h) as a measure. Observe that we obtained
an analytic expression for Fq which, contrary to the standard replica method, does not involve
derivation of the (integer) moments of the partition function. Direct use of Euler’s integral repre-
sentation for the gamma function give us

Z(h)s =

Γ(s)Z ∞

dt ts−1e−Z(h)t,

for Re (s) > 0.

(31)

Although the above Mellin integral converges only for Re(s) > 0, as Z(h) > 0, we will show how to
obtain from the above expression a formula for the free energy valid for Re (s) ≥ 0. Substituting
Eq. (31) in Eq. (27) we get

Φ(s) =

1

Γ(s)Z d[h]P (h)Z ∞

0

dt ts−1e−Z(h)t.

(32)

We already know that the distributional zeta function Φ(s) is deﬁned for Re(s) ≥ 0. Now we
will use the above expression for computing its derivative at s = 0 by analytic tools. We as-
sume at principle the commutativity of the following operations, disorder average, diﬀerentiation,
integration if necessary.

From the above discussion, it follows that the average free energy Fq can be written as

Fq = −

The integral Φ2(s) deﬁnes a continuous function in Re(s) ≥ 0, analytic in Re(s) > 0 and
diﬀerentiable at s = 0. It is easy to see that s = 0 is a ramiﬁcation point for this function. In the
innermost integral in Φ1(s) the series representation for the exponential converges uniformly (for
each h), so that we can reverse the order on integration and summation to obtain

and γ is Euler’s constant 0.577 . . . We have just shown that the contribution of −(d/ds)Φ1(s)|s=0 +
to the average free energy (see Eq. (39)) can be written as a series in which all integer moments
of the partition function appear. Although such a representation cannot be obtained, in general,
for the contribution coming from −(d/ds)Φ2(s)|s=0, we will show how to bound this contribution.
Using again the fact that Γ(s) has a pole at s = 0 with residue 1 and taking the derivative of the
product that deﬁnes Φ2 in Eq. (35), we conclude that

Observe that we cannot take the limit a → ∞, because in this case the above series become
meaningless. However, the contribution of R(a) to the free energy can be made as small as
desired, taking a large enough. A case of special interest is a = 1, because with this choice the

Deﬁning a distributional zeta-function and using analytic tools, we showed that all replicas con-
tribute to the average value of the free energy of the system. Using Eq. (15) and Eq. (44) we can
write the average free energy in terms of the vacuum to vacuum diagrams.

The main result of this paper is Eq. (44). Instead of the limit to zero replicas as in the usual
procedure, we obtained an expression for the average free energy as a series where all the replicas
contribute plus another term which can not be represented by a series on the replicas partition
function. For Z(0) bounded away from zero, the second term contribution’s can be made as small
as desired. Note that the representation of the average free energy just by a series on the the
replicas partition functions would not describe the loss of analyticity on the average free energy
in the Z(h) → 0 phase transitions.
Two comments are in order. First, in those phase transitions where Z(h) → 0, the divergence
of the free energy comes from R(a) = −(d/ds)Φ2(s) as revealed by direct inspection of Eq. (41);
the contribution to the free energy due to the series expansion captures its non-analytic behaviour
when Z(h) → ∞. Second, in the replica ﬁeld theory the symmetry group is Sk (the permutation
group of k elements). One advantage of the distributional zeta-function technique is that it is not
necessary to understand the properties of the permutation group when k → 0. Let us discuss
the replica symmetric ansatz, i.e., suppose that ϕi(x) = ϕ(x). For the case of identical replicas,
the saddle-point equations make sense for k < m2
σ . Therefore, in this case one could justiﬁes
this replica symmetric solution. For k ≥ m2
σ , we must deﬁne a shifted ﬁeld φ(x) = ϕ(x) − v,
for v = ( kσ−m2
In terms of this new ﬁeld φ(x), we get a positive mass squared with new
self-interaction vertices φ3(x) and φ(x)4. Therefore the symmetry between the replicas is broken
using the results of the saddle-point equations of the model.

4 Conclusions

There is a growing interest in disordered systems in physics and many areas beyond physics. In
statistical mechanics, the random magnetic ﬁeld Ising model has been investigated in the last forty
years. The hamiltonian of the random ﬁeld Ising model is analogous to the one of the classical
Ising model, but allowing for a quenched random magnetic ﬁeld. This model can be analyzed
using a collective description instead of dealing with individual elements. The hamiltonian of the
discrete model can be replaced by an eﬀective hamiltonian of the Landau-Ginzburg model, where
the order parameter is a continuous ﬁeld ϕ(x) coupled to a quenched random ﬁeld. The usual
approach to study such disordered systems is to transform the random problem into a translational
invariant one. For quenched disorder, one is mainly interested in averaging the free energy over the
disorder, which amounts to averaging the log of the partition function Z, the connected vacuum
to vacuum diagrams. The replica method is a powerful tool used to calculate the free energy of
systems with quenched disorder. Despite the absence of a mathematically rigorous derivation, the
standard replica method provides correct results in many situations. As we discussed, it is natural
to ask if it is possible to ﬁnd a mathematically rigorous derivation which legitimates the use of the
replica partition functions for computing the average free energy of the system. In this paper we
present a rigorous derivation of the average free energy in the continuous version of the random
ﬁeld Ising model, as the sum of a series using the replica partition functions plus a contribution
which, far from phase transitions, can be made as small as desired.

In order to ﬁnd the average free energy we deﬁne a distributional zeta-function. The derivative
of the distributional zeta-function at s = 0 yields the average free energy. Making use of the
Mellin transform and analytic continuation, it is possible to obtain a series representation for the
average free energy where all the integer moments of the partition function of the model contribute.
Our method is closely related to the use of spectral zeta-functions for evaluating the determinant
of elliptic diﬀerential operators in Euclidean ﬁeld theory. This technique also has been used to
calculate the renormalized vacuum energy of quantum ﬁeld in the presence of boundaries.

The distributional zeta-function technique is a mathematically rigorous method for computing
the average free energy using the replica partition functions. Further validation of the distribu-
tional zeta-function technique in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick [26] and also the random energy
model [57] is the natural continuation of the present work.
In the random energy model it is
known that for k < 1 there is a phase transition at some critical temperature, but high and low
temperature regimes exchange their roles. Also in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model, after in-
tegrating over the random spin couplings and using the saddle-point approximation, the average
free energy density is written in terms of an order parameter k × k matrix Qij. The stability of
, H has positive eigenvalues. For example, in
the model implies that the Hessian matrix
the subspace of the matrix satisfying Qij = q, the condition above leads to 1
k T rQ2 = (k − 1)q2,
which is always valid for k > 1. In the case of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model, at some stage
of the calculations we must use the saddle-point equations to extremize the free energy with re-
spect to some variable. As stressed by Dotsenko in Ref. [35], it is not clear that this condition of

∂Qij ∂Qkl

extremizing the free energy can be used in this formalism, where all the moments of the partition
function appear in the average free energy.

There are many papers studying ﬁnite size-eﬀects in Euclidean ﬁeld theory [58–62]. Suppose
a Euclidean ﬁeld theory with a (λϕ4) self-interaction deﬁned in a d-dimensional Euclidean space.
Assume that the domain where the ﬁeld is deﬁned is S1 × Rd−1. For very small radius, since there
is a size-dependent renormalized mass square, the system is in the disordered phase. Increasing
the radius of the compactiﬁed dimension, we obtain the critical size where a second order phase
transition occurs [63, 64]. A complete discussion of ﬁnite size eﬀects in phase transitions can be
found in [65]. For the reader interested in the study of ﬁnite size eﬀects in random systems, see
Refs. [66–69].

Recently, it was discussed a phase transition in the ﬁnite-size disordered λϕ4 model, using the
standard replica method. The authors considered the scalar model system at zero temperature
deﬁned in a space with periodic boundary conditions in one space dimension.
It was shown
that there is a critical length where the system develop a second-order phase transition, where
the system presents long-range correlations with power law decay [70]. As an application of
our approach, it would be interesting to discuss ﬁnite-size eﬀects in one disordered λϕ4 model
in a d-dimensional Euclidean space using this distributional zeta-function technique. Does the
renormalized mass obtained from the distributional zeta-function coincide with the renormalized
mass obtained by the usual replica method where the average free energy is obtained from a zero
component ﬁeld theory? This problem also will be subject of future investigations.

A The spectral zeta function in Euclidean ﬁeld theory

Here we present a new mathematical rigorous technique for computing the average free energy of a
disordered system with quenched randomness, using the replicas. The basic tool of this technique
is a distributional zeta-function. In this appendix we would like to discuss the similarities of our
approach with the spectral zeta-function regularization in Euclidean ﬁeld theory [43, 44].

If λk is a sequence of non-zero complex numbers, we deﬁne the zeta regularized product of

these numbers as

where

λk = e− d

ds ζ(s)|s=0,

Yk
ζ(s) =Xk

is the zeta-function associated with the sequence λk. If λk is the sequence of the positive eigenvalues
of the Laplacian on a manifold, then the zeta regularized product is the determinant of the
Laplacian. The free energy of a system with this eigenvalues in this case is

F =

1
2

d
ds

ζD(s)|s=0.

(A.3)

In order to obtain the free energy of a system, we have to show that ζD(s) has a meromorphic
continuation with at most simple poles, to the half-plane containing the origin and analytic at the
origin. We have scaling properties, i.e.,

d
ds

−

ζµD(s)|s=0 = −

d
ds

ζD(s)|s=0 + ln µ ζD(s)|s=0.

(A.4)

Note that there are sequences of numbers which are not zeta regularized, where the free energy is
not deﬁned [71, 72]. Suppose that the sequence of numbers is the sequence of the prime numbers.
In this case the prime zeta function P (s), s = σ + iτ , for σ, τ ∈ R is deﬁned as

Introducing the M¨obius function µ(n) [73] we can write

p−s, Re(s) > 1.

P (s) =Xp

P (s) =Xk

µ(k)

k

ln ζ(ks),

(A.5)

(A.6)

where ζ(s) is the Riemann zeta function [53]. The line Re(s) = 0 is a natural boundary of P (s).
Therefore the prime zeta function can be analytically extended only in the strip 0 < σ ≤ 1 [55,56].
Since we need to compute the derivative of the spectral zeta function at s = 0, the free energy is
not deﬁned. The sequence of primes numbers is not zeta-regularized.

In order to discuss the similarities of our approach with the spectral zeta-function regulariza-
tion in Euclidean ﬁeld theory, let us discuss the heat-kernel on Euclidean manifolds. Let M be
an arbitrary smooth connected d-dimensional compact Riemannian manifold. The Riemannian
structure allow to introduce on M volumes of all dimensions. The Riemannian d-volume is deﬁned
as dµ = √gdx1...dxd. Now consider the following initial boundary problem in (0,∞) × Rd. We
have

(A.7)

(A.8)

(A.9)

u(t, x) = ∆ u(t, x),

with the initial condition

and also

u(0, x) = f (x),

u(t, x)|x∈ ∂ Ω = 0,

13

where the symbol ∆ denotes the Laplacian in Rd. The evolution equation has the solution

u(t, x) = et∆Ωf (x).

(A.10)
Suppose that the function f (x) is f ∈ L2(Ω). The standard technique of the spectral theory of
elliptic operators implies that there exists a orthonormal basis [φk] in L2(Ω) such that φk is a
eigenfunction of −∆ in Ω with the eigenvalue λk = λk(Ω), and 0 ≤ λ1 ≤ λ2...λk → ∞, when
k → ∞. Therefore we can write the following series representation

where

We can write

where

f (x) =

dµ(y)f (y)φk(y).

ak =ZΩ
u(t, x) =ZΩ

(A.16)

We denote pΩ(t, x, y) the heat-kernel of Ω. The operator et∆Ω has the integral kernel pΩ(t, x, y).
We have

dµ(y) pΩ(t, y, y) =

Recall that the Mellin transform of f : R+ → C is deﬁned as

for those s ∈ C such that f (x) xs ∈ L1(R+). For example, if f (x) = e−x then the Mellin transform
is the gamma function, i.e.,

Γ(s) =Z ∞

Our mathematical approach to make rigorous the replica method using a distributional zeta-
function can be compared with the spectral zeta-function method widely used in quantum ﬁeld
theory. Using the Eq. (33) the average free energy of the continuous version for the random ﬁeld
Ising model can be written as
