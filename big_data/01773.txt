ABSTRACT

Context. To understand the role of the environment in galaxy formation, evolution, and present-day properties, it is essential to study
the multifrequency behavior of diﬀerent galaxy populations under various environmental conditions.
Aims. We study the stellar mass functions of diﬀerent galaxy populations in groups as a function of their large-scale environments
using multifrequency observations.
Methods. We cross-matched the SDSS DR10 group catalog with GAMA Data Release 2 and Wide-ﬁeld Survey Explorer (WISE)
data to construct a catalog of 1651 groups and 11436 galaxies containing photometric information in 15 diﬀerent wavebands ranging
from ultraviolet (0.152 µm) to mid-infrared (22 µm). We performed the spectral energy distribution (SED) ﬁtting of galaxies using
the MAGPHYS code and estimate the rest-frame luminosities and stellar masses. We used the 1/Vmax method to estimate the galaxy
stellar mass and luminosity functions, and the luminosity density ﬁeld of galaxies to deﬁne the large-scale environment of galaxies.
Results. The stellar mass functions of both central and satellite galaxies in groups are diﬀerent in low- and high-density, large-
scale environments. Satellite galaxies in high-density environments have a steeper low-mass end slope compared to low-density
environments, independent of the galaxy morphology. Central galaxies in low-density environments have a steeper low-mass end
slope, but the diﬀerence disappears for ﬁxed galaxy morphology. The characteristic stellar mass of satellite galaxies is higher in
high-density environments and the diﬀerence exists only for galaxies with elliptical morphologies.
Conclusions. Galaxy formation in groups is more eﬃcient in high-density, large-scale environments. Groups in high-density envi-
ronments have higher abundances of satellite galaxies, irrespective of the satellite galaxy morphology. The elliptical satellite galaxies
are generally more massive in high-density environments. The stellar masses of spiral satellite galaxies show no dependence on the
large-scale environment.

1. Introduction

Galaxies and their dark matter halos have grown hierarchically,
forming larger systems, such as groups, clusters, ﬁlaments, and
superclusters of galaxies, separated by enormous voids. In obser-
vations, this large-scale distribution of dark and baryonic matter
manifests itself as a complex web of galaxies. This cosmic web
includes a wide range of cosmic scales from the mega-parsec
(Mpc) galaxy group scale to the supercluster and ﬁlament scales,
several tens to hundreds of Mpc (Joeveer & Einasto 1978; Gre-
gory & Thompson 1978; Chincarini & Rood 1979; Zeldovich
et al. 1982; Tempel et al. 2014a). As a result, galaxies reside
in a variety of environments. A natural question is whether the
interplay of various physical processes during the hierarchical
growth of structures has also aﬀected the properties of galaxies
and which scale of environment plays a dominant role in galaxy
evolution.

The mass of a galaxy is likely the main driver of its evolution
(Gavazzi et al. 1996; Boselli et al. 2001; Gavazzi et al. 2002).
Until recently, theoretical models of the halo-galaxy relation-
ship have usually assumed that galaxy populations in dark mat-
ter halos depend solely on the halo mass and do not depend on
its large-scale environment and assembly history (Padilla et al.
2010, and references therein). Recent results, however, suggest
that the dependence on halo mass alone cannot explain all galaxy
properties. In theoretical studies, older dark matter halos are
found to cluster more strongly than more recently formed halos
of the same mass (Gao et al. 2005). This eﬀect, which is known
as assembly bias, suggests that the properties of a galaxy also
depend on its formation history and the environment, where it is
embedded.

Observational studies have also hinted at a connection be-
tween galaxy and group properties and the large-scale environ-
ments wherein they reside: Equal mass groups in superclus-
ters have higher correlation function amplitudes (Yaryura et al.
2012); late-type brightest group galaxies have higher luminosi-
ties and stellar masses, redder colors, lower star formation ac-
tivity, and longer star formation timescales when embedded in

superstructures (Luparello et al. 2015); the fraction of red galax-
ies is higher in high-density environments (superclusters) than in
low-density environments (Einasto et al. 2007, 2014); at a ﬁxed
local density, galaxy colors change toward void walls (Cecca-
relli et al. 2008); galaxies within groups with the same richness
and mass are redder/older in high-density regions (Lietzen et al.
2012; Luparello et al. 2013). These results support environmen-
tal eﬀects but are not conclusive about the dependence between
large-scale environment and galaxy properties.

The stellar mass is a basic galaxy parameter that correlates
strongly with almost all other galaxy properties (Kauﬀmann
et al. 2004) and also with the mass of its dark matter halo (Moster
et al. 2010). Thus the stellar mass function (SMF) of galaxies is
an observational quantity often used to constrain the models of
galaxy formation and evolution. Recently, Alpaslan et al. (2015)
reported that the SMF of galaxies also seems to vary in diﬀer-
ent large-scale structures. There is, however, no common con-
sensus about its global shape and also its behavior in diﬀerent
large-scale environments is still an open question. This is largely
associated with the nontrivial deﬁnition of large-scale environ-
ments and uncertainties in stellar mass estimations, which de-
pend on the models and wavelength coverage used. The mul-
tifrequency study of galaxies from ultraviolet (UV) to infrared
(IR) wavelengths allows us to constrain dust in galaxies and con-
struct a more detailed and accurate picture of physical properties,
including stellar masses, of a wide range of galaxy types. Re-
cently, several large-scale sky surveys have been carried out at
various wavelengths, e.g., in the far-ultraviolet (FUV) and near-
ultraviolet (NUV) by the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX),
in the optical by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), in the
near-infrared (NIR) by the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey
(UKIDSS), and in NIR and mid-infrared (MIR) by NASA’s
Wide-ﬁeld Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). By combining the
data from these diﬀerent surveys, one can construct broadband
spectral energy distribution (SED) of galaxies with appropriate
galaxy models. The best state-of-the-art model available for this
purpose is the model developed by da Cunha et al. (2008). It
is based on the stellar population synthesis model of Bruzual &
Charlot (2003) and the two-component dust model of Charlot
& Fall (2000). By ﬁtting the observed SEDs with models, we
can estimate rest-frame luminosities and other physical proper-
ties related to stellar and dust contents in galaxies. This method
was successfully applied to nearby star-forming galaxies from
the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxy Survey (SINGS), 3258 low-
redshift galaxies from the SDSS Data Release 6 (da Cunha et al.
2010), 250 µm selected galaxies from Herschel-ATLAS Survey
(Smith et al. 2012), and the Andromeda galaxy (Viaene et al.
2014). It was also tested with simulated galaxies from hydrody-
namical simulations (Hayward & Smith 2015).

Physical mechanisms like strangulation (Larson et al. 1980),
ram-pressure stripping (Gunn & Gott 1972), and harassment
(Moore et al. 1996), which are believed to transform galaxy
properties on group and cluster scales, mainly operate on satel-
lite galaxies. On much larger scales, the number of satellite
galaxies in groups are found to vary depending on whether they
are present within or outside ﬁlaments (Guo et al. 2015). Any
interplay between the inner group and large-scale environments
may inﬂuence the eﬃciency of typical physical mechanisms oc-
curring in groups and result in diﬀerences observed in properties
of satellite galaxies in diﬀerent large-scale environments. The
interdependence of environment and central and satellite galax-
ies on cosmological scales still remains a less explored topic
in galaxy evolution. We take a novel step toward understand-
ing the large-scale environmental eﬀect on central and satellite

galaxy evolution using multifrequency observations and galaxy
SED modeling. In this paper, we study the diﬀerences of the
galaxy SMFs for diﬀerent combinations of the large-scale struc-
ture, central and satellite galaxies, and galaxy morphology. For
this purpose, we ﬁrst expand the optical SDSS DR10 galaxy and
group catalog (Tempel et al. 2014b) to IR and UV wavelengths
with data from diﬀerent large-scale sky surveys. Using a publicly
available MAGPHYS SED ﬁtting code, we determine galaxy
rest-frame luminosities and stellar masses in groups inferred
from galaxy data at wavelength range 0.15 µm to 12.33 µm.
Then, we divide the galaxy r-band luminosity density ﬁeld into
low- and high-density, large-scale environments and study SMFs
of central and satellite galaxies in these two distinct environ-
ments. Our data analysis also gives the luminosity functions of
galaxies for 15 wavebands from UV to IR. Plots of these are
shown in appendix A.

2. Data
2.1. Ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared data
Photometric data from UV to NIR wavelengths come from the
GAMA Data Release 2 (Liske et al. 2015). The UV photo-
metric data come from the GalexCoGPhot catalog, which pro-
vides GALEX NUV (0.152 µm) and FUV (0.231 µm) curve-
of-growth photometry at optical positions for all GAMA DR2
objects. Optical and NIR data come from SersicCatAll catalog,
which provides photometry as a result of ﬁtting a single-Sersic
(1-component only) proﬁle to every GAMA DR2 object in each
of the bands u (0.3562 µm), g (0.4719 µm), r (0.6185 µm), i
(0.75 µm), z (0.8961 µm), Y (1.0319 µm), J (1.2511 µm), H
(1.6383 µm), and K (2.2085 µm). This catalog is constructed
using SIGMA v0.9-0 (Structural Investigation of Galaxies via
Model Analysis) tool on SDSS and UKIDSS LAS imaging data
(Kelvin et al. 2012). All magnitudes are expressed in AB mags.

2.2. Mid-infared data
The MIR data are taken from the latest data release from the
WISE survey (Wright et al. 2010), which has mapped the whole
sky with an angular resolution of 6.1(cid:48)(cid:48), 6.4(cid:48)(cid:48), 6.5(cid:48)(cid:48), and 12.0(cid:48)(cid:48)
in four wavebands, W1, W2, W3, and W4 with eﬀective wave-
lengths 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 µm, respectively. In the unconfused
regions on the ecliptic, WISE has achieved 5σ point source sen-
sitivities better than 0.08, 0.11, 1 and 6 mJy in the four bands
and a sensitivity better than 100 times than that of IRAS in the
12 µm band.

2.3. Optical group catalog
The optical group catalog used in this work is constructed from
SDSS DR10 galaxies using a friends-of-friends algorithm and
a linking length that varies with redshift as explained in detail
in (Tempel et al. 2014b). The catalog consists of both isolated
(not a member of any group) and grouped galaxies in all of the
588193 galaxies and 82458 groups. The eﬀective area of cov-
erage of the catalog is around 7221 square degrees and extends
up to redshift 0.2. The catalog is ﬂux limited with magnitude
limit 17.77 mag in the SDSS r band. The redshifts of galaxies
are taken from the SDSS spectroscopic sample, the Two-degree
Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2DFRS; Colless et al. 2001), the
Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS; Jarrett et al. 2003; Skrut-
skie et al. 2006) Redshift Survey (2MRS; Huchra et al. 2012),
and the Third Reference Catalogue of Bright Galaxies (RC3;

Corwin et al. 1994). The morphological classiﬁcation of galaxies
is based on the fraction of luminosity contributed by the de Vau-
couleurs proﬁle ( fdeV), the exponential proﬁle axis ratio (qexp),
u − r and g − r colors (see Tempel et al. (2011) for details).

ments containing 31% and 69% of all galaxies in the sample,
respectively. This value was also used in Tempel et al. (2009) to
classify galaxies into voids and other large-scale environments.

2.4. Construction of the far-UV to mid-IR catalog

The galaxies in the optical group catalog were ﬁrst identiﬁed in
GAMA, which resulted in 11056 galaxies and 1651 groups. In
these SDSS groups, 380 galaxies do not have GAMA counter-
parts and we use SDSS DR10 photometric information for these
galaxies. Combining these galaxies, the matched catalog resulted
in 11436 galaxies and 1651 groups. GAMA DR2 already pro-
vides cross identiﬁcations between UV, optical, and NIR data.
To combine MIR data with other wavebands, we searched for all
the WISE objects lying within an angular distance of 3(cid:48)(cid:48) from
optical positions of galaxies in the matched catalog. This an-
gular distance was chosen after many cross-matching trials so
as to minimize the number of multiple associations and max-
imize the number of unique associations. Around 1.32% and
97.56% of the galaxies were found to have multiple and unique
matches with WISE objects, respectively. All WISE objects that
are ﬂagged as contaminated by artifacts in one or more WISE
bands were deleted. This is about 3% of all matched WISE ob-
jects. Multiple associations were removed in the galaxy SED ﬁt-
ting process by selecting the match that ﬁts better. We restricted
our analysis in the redshift range 0.01–0.2. The ﬁnal galaxy cat-
alog consisted of 1635 groups and 11330 galaxies (about 2%
of the SDSS DR10 galaxy catalog) containing photometric in-
formation in GALEX, SDSS, UKIDSS, and WISE wavelengths
with the group membership criteria remaining the same as in the
optical group catalog. The number of detected galaxies in diﬀer-
ent wavelengths are shown in column 8 of Table 1. The eﬀective
area of coverage of the catalog is about 144 square degrees. It in-
cludes all the three equatorial survey regions of GAMA I called
G09, G12, and G15.

2.5. Quantifying galaxy environments

The ﬁnal step in our data preparation involved quantiﬁcation
of large-scale environments in the region of our catalog. Seg-
regating diﬀerent large-scale environments is not a trivial task,
since ﬁlaments and superclusters are mostly unvirialized struc-
tures and their density is only slightly larger than the cosmic
mean density (Liivamägi et al. 2012). As is well-known, most
of the galaxies are small and have a low luminosity. Hence, a
simple number density analysis of galaxies, which counts all the
galaxies with the same weight, cannot provide a precise descrip-
tion of the cosmic web. The luminosity density ﬁeld of galax-
ies is a powerful and widely used technique to deﬁne the large-
scale density distribution. In this method, the galaxy luminosi-
ties, corrected by observational biases and selection eﬀects, are
smoothed with an appropriate kernel, the width of which de-
termines the characteristic spatial scale. This approach leads to
the total three-dimensional luminosity density ﬁeld of the sur-
vey, where diﬀerent density levels represent diﬀerent character-
istic structures: clusters, ﬁlaments, voids, and superclusters. Fol-
lowing Liivamägi et al. (2012), we use the normalized optical
galaxy luminosity density ﬁeld with a smoothing scale of 8 h−1
Mpc for characterizing the large-scale environment of our galaxy
and group sample. We use the optical galaxy density value of
1.5 in units of cosmic mean luminosity density to divide our
galaxy sample into low- and high-density, large-scale environ-

3. Methods
3.1. Fitting spectral energy distributions
The UV to IR part of the SED contains a lot of information
about stars and dust in galaxies. However, to extract such in-
formation, models are necessary to link physical properties of a
galaxy with its observed SED. The best state-of-the-art model
available that is consistent with observations and simulations, is
that by da Cunha et al. (2008). This model is based on the prin-
ciple that the light emitted from stellar populations in a galaxy is
partly absorbed by dust and re-emitted at longer wavelengths. It
computes the spectral evolution of galaxies using the population
synthesis model of Bruzual & Charlot (2003) , whereas dust at-
tenuation is computed using the two-component model of Char-
lot & Fall (2000). We use a publicly available MAGPHYS SED
ﬁtting tool to ﬁt the observed galaxy SEDs to a library of model
SEDs extending from UV to IR wavelengths with known physi-
cal parameters. The ﬁtting produces the best-ﬁt, rest-frame mag-
nitudes and various other physical parameters related to galaxies
and also provides the range of their likelihood values using a
Bayesian approach.

There are a few concerns about the model used in this work:
the eﬀects of viewing angle, AGN contamination, and dust grain
composition. The recent work by (Hayward & Smith 2015),
in which they performed MAGPHYS SED ﬁtting on simulated
galaxies from hydrodynamical simulation, has shown that MAG-
PHYS recovers most of the physical parameters well regardless
of the viewing angle. They also found that even when the contri-
bution of AGNs to the UV–mm luminosity is around 25 percent,
the ﬁts are acceptable and the parameters recovered are accu-
rate. The largest discrepancy appears when assuming a diﬀerent
composition of dust. Both Milky Way type dust and Large Mag-
ellanic Cloud type dust produce acceptable ﬁts, but the discrep-
ancy increases for Small Magellanic Cloud type dust composi-
tion. Our sample consists of bright spiral galaxies and hence the
Milky Way type dust is a reasonable assumption.

Carefully calibrated photometric data for diﬀerent wave-
lengths and from diﬀerent surveys are needed for reliable esti-
mates of SEDs. We use proﬁle-ﬁtted ﬂuxes that give a measure
of the total stellar light from a galaxy at all wavelengths as in-
put to the code. In WISE bands, for the sources with signal-to-
noise (S/N) ratios of less than two, the given magnitudes are 2
σ brightness upper limits in magnitude units. Such sources ac-
count for 1.1%, 1.1%, 28.1%, and 68.0% of all galaxies in the
matched catalog in W1, W2, W3, and W4 bands, respectively.
In WISE, photometric measurements of both stars and galax-
ies are based on proﬁle ﬁts using the point spread function as
the source model. Although this method minimizes the eﬀects of
source blending, this may lead to underestimation of true ﬂuxes
for extended sources. Chang et al. (2015) found that the ﬂux un-
derestimation depends on the eﬀective radius (Re) of the source
and may be estimated as
(cid:52)m = 0.10 + 0.46 log(Re) + 0.47 log(Re)2 + 0.08 log(Re)3.
The correction is applied to galaxies with eﬀective radii of
greater than 0.5 arcseconds. Following Chang et al. (2015), we
use the eﬀective radii obtained after dividing SDSS r-band eﬀec-
tive radii by a factor of 1.5 to convert galaxy size from optical to

infrared. These corrections are added to ﬂux uncertainties in the
respective WISE wavebands.

3.2. Reducing the color bias in the sample
Our sample is r-band selected (mr < 17.77 mag), so that the sam-
ple galaxies in the r band do not represent a volume limited (VL)
sample, but are aﬀected by a certain amount of Malmquist-type
bias. In the other wavelength bands, not originally used for se-
lection, the biases generally diﬀer (cf. the "Gould eﬀect"; Gould
1993). Therefore, the form of the average SED of the observed
sample diﬀers from the average SED of a representative VL sam-
ple. This becomes visible as color biases in the observed sample,
as shown in Fig. 1. As a result of this bias, galaxies with speciﬁc
color are not detected in the sample as seen from the gap at the
lower right part of the color magnitude plots. FUV, NUV, and
W3 bands are very strongly color biased. The sample of galaxies
fainter than the bright limit (vertical solid line) have negligible
color biases but this limit is not used as it reduces the sample size
signiﬁcantly for any statistical analysis. In order to reduce color
bias in the sample, we adopt the method used by Driver et al.
(2012) and calculate the mean color of the bands with respect
to the r band; we make a magnitude cut as shown in Fig. 1 to
remove all galaxies fainter than the faint limits (vertical dashed
line) in each of the wavebands separately. Although this method

Article number, page 4 of 15

does not completely remove the color bias, it is a good compro-
mise between the bias and sample size. This procedure is applied
after estimating rest-frame magnitudes from the SED ﬁtting as
was explained in the previous section. The number of galaxies
in diﬀerent wavebands after such color cuts is tabulated in col-
umn 9 of Table 1.

4. Fit results
Figure 2 shows the diﬀerence between the observed and model
ﬁtted magnitudes at various wavebands used. The median diﬀer-
ence is close to the zero line in all wavebands except W4 band.
In the W4 band, the median diﬀerence is about +1.5 mag. The
upper limit in source ﬂuxes in WISE bands may contribute to the
large oﬀset seen in the W4 band. The real signal in these bands
may be much weaker than these upper limits, which result in oﬀ-
set toward positive values. Also, W4 ﬁlter transmission curve has
been revised, but MAGPHYS models are not yet updated in the
W4 band. Similar oﬀset in W4 band is also seen in Driver et al.
(2016).

The ﬁtting also provides chi square (χ2) goodness of ﬁt val-
ues. The χ2 values are reasonably small with few outliers. To
test whether neglecting AGN heating in the model results in bad
ﬁts, we divided galaxies in the catalog into star-forming galaxies
and AGNs based on classiﬁcations provided in GAMA, which

uses the Kewley et al. (2001) classiﬁcation scheme. No signiﬁ-
cant dependence of the chi square (χ2) goodness of ﬁt values on
galaxy types was found and the distribution of χ2 values (Fig. 3)
are very similar for both the star-forming galaxies and AGNs.
Based on the analysis of the model SEDs of MAGPHYS, Smith
et al. (2012) derived a relation (equation B1) between the num-
ber of bands used during SED ﬁtting and the number of degrees
of freedom. Our 15 band photometry corresponds to 9 degrees of
freedom, which means that above a chi square value 20 there is
a probability of less than 1 percent that the observations are con-
sistent with the models. We set this limit when making any statis-
tical analysis with the sample. Within this limit, MAGPHYS was
found to reproduce the galaxy parameters of simulated galaxies
with good accuracy (Hayward & Smith 2015). As the WISE cat-
alog contains both stars and galaxies, such a χ2 limit also reduces
the stellar contamination present in the sample when matching
galaxies with WISE sources.

It also provides the likelihood distribution of stellar masses and
we take median values as the best estimates. The stellar masses
obtained agree very well with SDSS and GAMA (Taylor et al.
2011) values in general (Fig. 4). The median and standard devi-
ation of the diﬀerences between our and SDSS values are found
to be −0.098 and 0.886, respectively. For GAMA, these values
are found to be −0.029 and 0.477, respectively. For estimating
stellar mass in galaxies, SDSS and GAMA use SED ﬁtting to
optical bands. The observed similarities show that using only op-
tical band information can also provide good estimates for stellar
masses in galaxies.

4.3. Rest-frame absolute magnitudes
The SED ﬁtting also provides estimates of the expected rest-
frame ﬂuxes in diﬀerent bands by simultaneously ﬁtting the
observed SEDs with models. It also provides ﬂux estimates of
galaxies in bands where detection has not been possible because
of observational limitations. However, we only use rest-frame
ﬂuxes in bands which have detections and restrict our analysis to
galaxies with χ2 < 20. Such a restriction increases the reliability
of our results. We convert the rest-frame (k-corrected) ﬂuxes in
diﬀerent bands obtained from SED ﬁtting into absolute magni-
tudes in AB units for our analysis. The absolute magnitudes are
not dust de-attenuated.

5. Statistical properties of the sample
In order to check the reliability of the sample and its rest-frame
luminosities obtained from SED ﬁtting, we construct the galaxy
stellar mass and luminosity functions in diﬀerent bands. We
compare our galaxy SMF with the results from Baldry et al.
(2008) and Kelvin et al. (2014). We also compare the luminos-
ity functions in diﬀerent bands with SDSS (Blanton et al. 2003)
and GAMA (Driver et al. 2012) results. We use the Schechter ﬁt
parameters in the Table. 4 in Driver et al. (2012) for luminosity
function comparisons.

The ﬁtting gives many physical parameters characterizing galax-

5.1. Galaxy luminosity function
The galaxy LFs at all bands are estimated using the 1/Vmax sta-

of the color bias in the sample by adjusting the 1/Vmax volume
according to each object’s color. However, it is less eﬀective at
the low luminosity end, where a galaxy with a speciﬁc color may
not be detected in our sample. At a waveband X (X = FUV,
NUV, u, g, i, z, Y, J, H, K, W1, W2, W3 or W4), the maximum
volume available for each galaxy in the sample is estimated us-
ing the magnitude limit as either 17.77 − (magr − magX) or the
faint limit in that band, depending on which is brighter. The lu-
minosity distribution is then obtained by

where c is the ratio of the number of galaxies before χ2 cut to
the number of galaxies after χ2 cut. Vmax,i is the maximum co-
moving volume over which the ith galaxy can be observed, IA(x)
is the indicator function that selects the galaxies belonging to a
particular absolute magnitude bin (taken here as 0.5 AB mag)
and the sum runs over all galaxies in the sample. η is the cosmic
variance correction factor (η = 0.85, Driver et al. 2011). For each
waveband, the absolute magnitude limits fainter than which the
method fails to correct for the color biases are calculated using
the bright limits indicated in Table 1. The faint absolute magni-
tude limit values at diﬀerent wavebands are shown in column 7
of Table 1. The absolute magnitude bins that contain fewer than
ten galaxies toward the brightest part of the magnitude distri-
bution do not contribute signiﬁcantly to the overall luminosity
density. The bright absolute magnitude limit values at diﬀerent
wavebands are shown in column 7 of Table 1.

Figure A.1 shows the obtained luminosity functions as well
as a comparison with the GAMA and Blanton et al. (2003) re-
sults for redshift 0.1. Within the selection boundaries, the optical
galaxy LFs agree well with Blanton et al. (2003) results. Com-
pared to our estimates, the GAMA LFs are shifted toward the
brighter end at optical and NIR bands except the K band. At
FUV and NUV wavelengths, the GAMA luminosity functions
have higher amplitudes than our results. These diﬀerences are
mainly due to diﬀerent magnitude limits, redshift ranges, pho-
tometry, and sampling. The GAMA sample is about 1.6 mag-

nitude deeper than Blanton et al. (2003) and our samples. The
GAMA results use r-band matched aperture photometry, Blan-
ton et al. (2003) use Petrosian magnitudes, whereas we use Sér-
sic proﬁle ﬁtted magnitudes to construct the LFs at optical and
NIR wavelengths. Sérsic magnitudes are brighter than Petrosian
and aperture magnitudes for galaxies with higher Sérsic indices.
Sérsic LFs were found to be shifted toward the bright relative
to the LFs based on Petrosian and aperture magnitudes in the r
band by Hill et al. (2011). This shows that diﬀerent magnitude
types used aﬀect the derived LFs noticably.

5.2. Galaxy stellar mass function
The galaxies in the sample are divided into logarithmic stellar
mass bins to estimate the galaxy SMF. For each bin, the galaxy
SMF is given by

Here, c is the ratio of the number of galaxies before χ2 cut to
the number of galaxies after χ2 cut, and Vmax,i is the maximum
comoving volume over which the ith galaxy can be observed and
is obtained in the same way as explained in section 5.1. IA(x)
is the indicator function that selects the galaxies belonging to a
particular stellar mass bin (taken as 100.5 M(cid:12)) and the sum runs
over all galaxies in the sample. Recent studies have shown that
the galaxy SMF has a distinctive bump around 1010.6 M(cid:12) and
can be best approximated by a double Schechter form with a
combined knee (see Baldry et al. 2008; Peng et al. 2010; Baldry
et al. 2012; Kelvin et al. 2014). It can be expressed as

ber of diﬀerent factors such as inclusion of the UV and IR wave-
lengths, diﬀerent assumptions in the SED ﬁtting, and diﬀerent
photometry. These diﬀerences also aﬀect the shape of the global
galaxy SMF as seen in our results.

6. Galaxy stellar mass functions in different

environments

6.1. All galaxies
To study the large-scale environmental dependence on galaxy
stellar mass, we divide our galaxy sample into low-density
(Den8 < 1.5) and high-density (Den8 > 1.5) environments ac-
cording to their spatial location in the luminosity density ﬁeld.
We also construct the SMFs of galaxies in these two distinct en-
vironments. High-density environments have a higher number
density of galaxies than low-density environments. To take this
eﬀect into account and to facilitate direct comparisons, we draw
equal numbers of galaxies randomly from each of these sam-
ples when constructing the SMFs. For each sample, we calculate
the mean densities and error in densities in diﬀerent stellar mass
bins by combining all the SMFs obtained from 1000 diﬀerent
bootstrap subsamples and ﬁt a single Schechter function to these
values to get the best ﬁt. For each sample, we also estimate all the
single Schechter function ﬁts to galaxy SMFs obtained from all
the bootstrap subsamples. Figure 6(a) visualizes the results and
Table B.2 shows the best-ﬁt Schechter parameters with errors
for galaxies in low- and high-density environments. Compared
to low-density environments, the best Schechter function ﬁt is
shifted toward higher stellar masses for galaxies in high-density
environments. In Fig. 7(a), we show the 1σ (dark colored region)
and 2σ (light colored region) error contours of the correspond-
ing Schechter ﬁt parameters, characteristic stellar mass (M(cid:63)
st) and
low-mass slope (α) at 95% conﬁdence level. The SMFs of galax-
ies are diﬀerent in high- and low-density environments. At 2σ,
high-density environments have higher M(cid:63)
st than low-density en-
vironments, but α does not show any clear diﬀerence. For com-
parison, we also show the results (points with errorbars) from
Alpaslan et al. (2015) in three diﬀerent environments, namely
voids, tendrils, and ﬁlaments.These environments are deﬁned us-
ing the ﬁlament ﬁnder algorithm based on a minimal spanning
tree method (Alpaslan et al. 2014). As the deﬁnition of environ-
ment in our method is completely diﬀerent, our results can only
be compared qualitatively with those in Alpaslan et al. (2015).
Qualitatively, our results agree with Alpaslan et al. (2015); M(cid:63)
st
increases toward high-density environments.

6.2. All centrals and satellites
We further divide each of our high- and low-density galaxy sam-
ples into centrals and satellites to study the environmental de-
pendence on the stellar content of central and satellite galaxies
in groups in diﬀerent large-scale environments. Central galaxies
are those with the highest stellar mass in groups and the remain-
ing members are classiﬁed as satellites. Our central galaxy sam-
ples also include isolated galaxies. We then construct the SMFs
of centrals and satellites in both high- and low-density, large-
scale environments (Fig. 6b). We use the same method as ex-
plained in section 6.1 to construct the galaxy SMFs. The corre-
sponding single Schechter function ﬁt parameters with errors are
shown in Table B.2. We also draw the 1σ (dark colored region)
and 2σ (light colored region) error ellipses of M(cid:63)
st and α at 95%
conﬁdence level (Fig. 7b). For central galaxies, the error ellipses

one Schechter function dominating at stellar masses greater than
M(cid:63)
st and the second one dominating at lower masses. The result-
ing galaxy SMF (red circular points) and the double Schechter
ﬁt including errors (red shaded region) are shown in the stellar
mass range 108.0–1012.0 in Fig. 5. The curve ﬁtting of the double
Schechter function is performed using nonlinear least squares ﬁt-
ting technique with ﬁve free parameters. The ﬁt limits and errors
in number density of galaxies in each stellar mass bin are esti-
mated using the bootstrap resampling technique. The ﬁt param-
eters with errors are shown in Table B.1. The best-ﬁt paramaters
highly deviate from the results of Baldry et al. (2008) (B08 here-
after) and Kelvin et al. (2014) (K14 hereafter). Considering the
errors in ﬁt parameters, M(cid:63)
st has higher values than B08 and K14.

K14 values.

Unlike luminosity, which is a directly observable quantity,
the stellar mass is commonly estimated from the multifrequency
data by ﬁtting the observed SEDs with a library of model SEDs
with known physical properties. A number of diﬀerent models
exist regarding the initial mass function (IMF), star formation
history (SFH), stellar populations, and dust that are used to build
the model SEDs. Many studies have tried to quantify the eﬀect
of these assumptions on stellar mass estimates (Marchesini et al.
2009; Maraston et al. 2010; Ilbert et al. 2010; Michałowski et al.
2012; Banerji et al. 2013; Schaerer et al. 2013). These studies
commonly agree that stellar masses can be reliably constrained
but uncertainties up to 0.5 dex may exist depending on diﬀerent
models used. Marchesini et al. (2009) quantiﬁed how the uncer-
tainties associated with the assumptions made in the SED ﬁtting
method may aﬀect the galaxy SMF. They ﬁnd that the shape of
the galaxy SMF at the low-mass end may change depending on
the assumed metallicity and dust model. SDSS and GAMA used
only optical wavelengths to estimate stellar masses from the SED
ﬁtting. Here, we attempt to include UV and MIR wavelengths.
We do not ﬁnd signiﬁcant diﬀerences in our estimates although
our values have small systematic oﬀsets compared to SDSS and

of central galaxies are diﬀerent in high- and low-density envi-
ronments. High-density environments have higher α value than
low-density environments, but the M(cid:63)
st value shows no clear dif-
ference between diﬀerent environments. Similar to central galax-
ies, the SMFs of satellite galaxies are diﬀerent in high- and low-
density environments. High-density environments have steeper
α value than low-density environments. The M(cid:63)
st value is clearly
higher in high-density environments at 1σ only. The SMFs of
central and satellite galaxies may have variations depending on
the choice of the central galaxy deﬁnition and the group catalogs
used (see appendix C for details).

6.3. Centrals and satellites with ﬁxed morphology

We divide central and satellite galaxy samples in both high- and
low-density environments into spiral and elliptical populations
to study the environmental dependence on the stellar content of
central and satellite galaxies with ﬁxed morphology in diﬀer-
ent large-scale environments. We further construct the SMFs of
central and satellite galaxies with diﬀerent morphologies across
various large-scale environments using the method explained in
section 6.1.

Figure 6(c) shows the SMFs of central and satellite galaxies with
spiral morphologies in low- and high-density, large-scale envi-

environments compared to that in low-density environments.

7. Discussion
7.1. Galaxy stellar mass and halo relation
According to the theory of galaxy formation, stars can form
from cooling gas inside a virialized and gravitationally bound
dark matter halo. The gas cooling and star formation rates of
the galaxy depend mainly on the host halo mass (White & Rees
1978). In this scenario, the stellar mass of a galaxy can be ex-
pected to correlate strongly with the mass of its halo in which
the galaxy formed. Several observational and simulation stud-
ies have tried to quantify the relation between the stellar mass
of a galaxy and its halo mass. The stellar mass of a galaxy has
been found to correlate with its halo mass with ﬁnite scatter.
It increases rapidly with the halo mass when the halo mass is
small, but slowly for large halo masses with a break in the rela-
tion around halo mass of 1012 M(cid:12) and galaxy stellar mass of 5 ×
1010 M(cid:12) (Moster et al. 2010). The relation is very shallow at the
high-mass end and the scatter in the relation is also higher. We
note that our sample consists mainly of small groups and, thus,
the correlation between the galaxy stellar mass and halo mass in
our sample is expected to have less scatter. Some studies have
also pointed out that the galaxy stellar and halo mass relation
may diﬀer between various morphologies and late-type galaxies
reside in less massive halos than early types (Rodríguez-Puebla
et al. 2015, and references therein). Using hydrodynamical sim-
ulations, Tonnesen & Cen (2015) recently found a higher stellar
to halo mass ratio in halos within the mass range 1011–1012.9 M(cid:12)
in large-scale denser environments. The dark matter halo mass
function varies across diﬀerent large-scale environments (Hahn
et al. 2007). The low-mass end has the same slope in clusters,
voids, ﬁlaments, and sheets, but the position of the high-mass
cutoﬀ depends on environment. The cutoﬀ mass is the lowest in
voids and gradually increases toward sheets, ﬁlaments, and clus-
ters. In the halo mass range M < 5 × 1012.9h−1 M(cid:12) , halos of a
given mass tend to be older in high-density, large-scale environ-
ments and independent of environment at larger masses (Hahn
et al. 2007). The present day halos in high-density environments
are hence more massive and evolved than those in low-density
environments as they have undergone many merger and accre-
tion events during their evolution. The shift of the characteristic
stellar mass toward higher stellar masses observed in our analy-
sis of the SMFs of all galaxies in high-density, large-scale envi-
ronments compared to the low-density environments may simply

vironments.

7.2. Stellar mass growth of central and satellite galaxies

When a larger halo accretes a smaller halo with its central galaxy,
the accreted halo turns into a subhalo and its galaxy becomes
a satellite of the accreting halo. Stellar mass growth of galax-
ies then occurs mainly by star formation, accretion of smaller
satellite galaxies, or major mergers. In low-mass halos, the stel-
lar mass growth occurs mainly by star formation, while mergers
play the dominant role in high-mass halos (Zehavi et al. 2012).
The galaxy merger rate in the semianalytical models is found
to depend strongly on environment, where higher density re-
gions have larger merger rates (Jian et al. 2012). According to
our results, the characteristic stellar mass of the central galaxy
SMF shows no clear diﬀerences in high- and low-density envi-
ronments but the low-mass end slope is steeper in low-density
environments. Such trends may be attributed to higher abun-
dances of low mass and younger halos with low stellar mass
central galaxies in low-density environments. In contrast to cen-
tral galaxies, the satellite galaxies in high-density environments
have higher characteristic stellar mass and the shift is only ob-
served for satellite galaxies of elliptical morphologies and not for
spiral satellites. Such diﬀerences may occur because galaxies in
high-density environments reside in relatively more massive and
evolved halos than low-density environments. The low-mass end
in the SMFs of satellite galaxies have steeper slopes in high-
density environments irrespective of their morphologies. This
suggests that groups in high-density environments have higher
abundances of satellite galaxies than those in low-density envi-
ronments. We investigate further whether this is true at a ﬁxed
halo mass. We use the dynamical mass of a group as a proxy
of its halo mass and study it as a function of group richness. It
is clear from Fig. 8 that groups in high-density environments are
richer in galaxies, i.e., show higher abundances of satellite galax-
ies in all dynamical mass bins than low-density environments.
Similar trends are also seen in the richness of galaxies with spi-
ral and elliptical morphologies. Recently, Guo et al. (2015) have

also shown that central galaxies in ﬁlaments have more satellites
than elsewhere.

All these results support the scenario where groups with sim-
ilar halos in high-density environments have high levels of sub-
structures (Espino-Briones et al. 2007) and higher stellar mass
content in those substructures. This suggests that galaxy forma-
tion is more eﬃcient in subhalos located in high-density envi-
ronments. A plausible scenario is that the high-density environ-
ments have more ﬁlaments, which supply cold gas to halos re-
sulting in increased galaxy formation eﬃciency.

8. Conclusion
We have used GAMA DR2 data, WISE data, SDSS DR10 group
catalog, and the MAGPHYS code to construct a multifrequency
catalog of groups of galaxies with wavelengths ranging from UV
to MIR. We studied the galaxy SMFs of diﬀerent galaxy popula-
tions in groups in diﬀerent large-scale environments. The main
results are summarized below:

1. The global galaxy SMF obtained from multifrequency
(0.152–22µm) galaxy SED ﬁtting diﬀers from results in the
literature. It has a slightly higher characteristic stellar mass
than results from Baldry et al. (2008) and Kelvin et al.
(2014).

2. The SMFs of central galaxies in groups diﬀer in high- and
low-density environents. The low-mass end slope is steeper
in high-density environments compared to low-density en-
vironments, but the characteristic stellar mass are similar in
both environments.

3. The SMFs of satellite galaxies in groups vary in diﬀerent
large-scale environments. High-density environments have
a steeper low-mass slope and a higher characteristic stellar
mass than that in low-density environments.

4. The SMFs of central galaxies with spiral morphologies are
diﬀerent in high- and low-density, large-scale environments.
However, the diﬀerences in the Schechter ﬁt parameters are
not clear. The galaxy SMFs of central galaxies of ellipti-
cal morphologies are similar in high- and low-density, large-
scale environments.

5. The SMFs of satellite galaxies with spiral morphologies
are diﬀerent in high- and low-density, large-scale environ-
ments. In high-density environments the low-mass end slope
is higher than that in low-density environments, but the char-
acteristic stellar mass is similar in both environments. The
SMFs of satellite galaxies with elliptical morphologies are
diﬀerent in diﬀerent large-scale environments. High-density
environments have a higher low-mass end slope and a higher
characteristic stellar mass than that in low-density, large-
scale environments.

Our ﬁrst paper in the series of planned environmental studies
of groups using multifrequency analysis of galaxies shows that
the large-scale environment plays a signiﬁcant role in shaping
the SMFs of diﬀerent galaxy populations in groups. Groups in
high-density environments have higher abundances of satellite
galaxies, irrespective of the satellite galaxies morphology. For
ellipticals, this trend is more obvious. Elliptical satellite galax-
ies are in general more massive in high-density environments.
Stellar masses of spiral satellite galaxies do not show any depen-
dence on large-scale environment. We also note that the SMFs of
satellite and central galaxies may diﬀer with group selection and
central galaxy deﬁnition. The small sample size has restricted us
to using a simple division of groups into void and nonvoid re-
gions. However, the luminosity density method also allows us to

separate high-density regions into ﬁner structures such as ﬁla-
ments and superclusters. Using a much larger sample and wider
wavelength coverage from the whole GAMA panchromatic data
release (Driver et al. 2016), we plan to study stellar masses, lu-
minosities, and star formation properties of groups located in
these structures. This will allow us to constrain physical mecha-
nisms by which large-scale environments may transform galaxy
properties.

Appendix C: Central and satellite galaxy stellar mass functions
In this section, we perform a simple exercise to check how diﬀerent deﬁnitions of central galaxies and use of diﬀerent group catalogs
may aﬀect the SMFs of central and satellite galaxies. For this, we compare our results with that obtained from the GAMA group

catalog (Robotham et al. 2011). First, we ﬁnd the galaxies in the whole GAMA catalog with the highest stellar mass in their groups
and deﬁne these as central galaxies and the remaining members as satellite galaxies. Then, we cross-match these galaxies with our
multifrequency catalog, in which the central galaxies also have the same deﬁnition. Then, we extract two samples, one containing
galaxies that are deﬁned as centrals in the GAMA group catalog and other consisting of galaxies that are deﬁned as centrals in our
group catalog. Next, we make 1000 diﬀerent random samplings from each of these samples and estimate the corresponding SMFs.
In both cases, we use the stellar mass estimates from our multifrequency catalog. The red and green ellipses shown in Fig. C.1
represent the error ellipses of Schechter ﬁt parameters, M(cid:63)
st and α, for central galaxies in our and GAMA catalogs, respectively. The
error ellipses are well separated from each other. However, the low-mass end slopes are similar but M(cid:63)
st seem to have lower values
in GAMA centrals. Similarly, we also obtain the error ellipses of the Schechter ﬁt parameters, M(cid:63)
st and α for satellite galaxies in
GAMA and our catalog separately. The 2σ error ellipses are overlapping but the 1σ error ellipses are well separated. The low-mass
end slopes are similar, but the GAMA satellites clearly have higher M(cid:63)
st.

Fig. C.1. Error ellipses at 95% conﬁdence level
for stellar mass function ﬁt parameters (M(cid:63)
st and
α) of central and satellite galaxies for diﬀerent
catalogs and central galaxy deﬁnitions. MMGs
represent the most massive galaxies in groups
and BCGs represent the brightest galaxies in
the groups. Red and blue (green and black) el-
lipses represent the error ellipses for the MMGs
and not MMGs in our multifrequency (GAMA)
group catalog. The golden and brown ellipses
represent the error ellipses for the BCGs and
not BCGs in our multifrequency group catalog,
respectively.

In order to see if the deﬁnition of central galaxy based on luminosity aﬀects the SMFs of the satellite and central galaxies,
we selected the brightest galaxy in our sample as the central galaxy and remaining members as satellites. The golden and brown
ellipses in Fig. C.1 show the corresponding error ellipses of the Schechter ﬁt parameters, M(cid:63)
st and α for central and satellite galaxies,
respectively. The error ellipse for the brightest central galaxies is almost the same as that for the most massive central galaxies.
The error ellipse for the satellite galaxies of the brightest central galaxies overlaps with that for the satellite galaxies of the most
massive central galaxies. However, M(cid:63)
st and α have similar values. This shows that the SMFs of central and satellite galaxies may
diﬀer based on the deﬁnition of the central galaxy and the group catalog used.
