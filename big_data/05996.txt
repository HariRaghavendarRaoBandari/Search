We study the composition of the faint radio population selected from the VLA-COSMOS 3GHz
Large Project, a radio continuum survey performed at 10 cm wavelength. The survey covers the
full 2 square degree COSMOS ﬁeld with mean rms ∼ 2.3 m Jy/beam, cataloging 10,899 source
components above 5 × rms. By combining these radio data with UltraVISTA, optical, near-
infrared, and Spitzer/IRAC mid-infrared data, as well as X-ray data from the Chandra Legacy,
Chandra COSMOS surveys, we gain insight into the emission mechanisms within our radio
sources out to redshifts of z ∼ 5. From these emission characteristics we classify our souces
as star forming galaxies or AGN. Using their multi-wavelength properties we further separate the
AGN into sub-samples dominated by radiatively efﬁcient and inefﬁcient AGN, often referred to as
high- and low-excitation emission line AGN. We compare our method with other results based on
ﬁtting of the sources’ spectral energy distributions using both galaxy and AGN spectral models,
and those based on the infrared-radio correlation. We study the fractional contributions of these
sub-populations down to radio ﬂux levels of ∼10 m Jy. We ﬁnd that at 3 GHz ﬂux densities above
∼400 m Jy quiescent, red galaxies, consistent with the low-excitation radio AGN class constitute
the dominant fraction. Below densities of ∼200 m Jy star-forming galaxies begin to constitute
the largest fraction, followed by the low-excitation, and X-ray- and IR-identiﬁed high-excitation
radio AGN.

SF galaxies vs. radio AGN in VLA-COSMOS 3GHz Large Project

N. Baran

1. Introduction

In extragalactic radio (cm) continuum surveys two main populations of sources are usually de-
tected: star-forming galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN) (e.g., Miley 1980, Condon 1992, and
recently Smolˇci´c et al. 2008). A large fraction of radio emission originates from synchrotron radia-
tion emitted by supernovae explosions, and from the vicinity of supermassive black holes (Condon,
1992). A smaller fraction arises from the free - free scattering processes. AGN emit throughout
the electromagnetic spectrum, and not only are they detectable at the radio wavelengths, but cer-
tain types of AGN are powerful radio sources. In recent years, the presently favored classiﬁcation
scheme for radio sources focuses on their physical properties, and is linked to the existence (or the
lack) of high-excitation optical emission lines (Hine & Longair 1979, Hardcastle et al. 2006, 2007,
Allen et al. 2006, Smolˇci´c et al. 2008, Smolˇci´c 2009, Heckman & Best 2014). Optically deﬁned
blue and green galaxies are the usual hosts of high-excitation radio AGN (HERAGN) which can
also be identiﬁed via their optical, X-ray and/or mid-infrared photometry (e.g., Hardcastle et al.
2013). Low-excitation radio AGN (LERAGN) are only detectable at radio wavelengths, and are
thought to be hosted by quiescent red galaxies (see Smolˇci´c 2009), and are also regarded as radio
loud (Condon 1992, Padovani et al. 2015). These two distinct types of radio AGN also exhibit
differences in the way they accrete matter onto the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) (e.g.,
Hardcastle et al. 2006, Smolˇci´c 2009). HERAGN are found to be accreting radiatively efﬁciently,
likely through the presence of an accretion disk, as postulated by the uniﬁed model of AGN (e.g.,
Urry & Padovani 1995). LERAGN are thought to be powered via advection dominated accretion
ﬂow (see Heckman & Best 2014), and do not ﬁt into the uniﬁed model of AGN (e.g., Smolˇci´c
2009, Best & Heckman 2012). A set of proxies reﬂecting the physical properties of the sources
detected in deep sky surveys, such as COSMOS, would allow for their separation into the above-
mentioned sub-populations. In this work, we use proxies derived from optical, infrared, and X-ray
data, to determine the nature of the sources detected in the VLA-COSMOS 3GHz Large Project
(Smolˇci´c et al., in prep), and to study the population mix of microjansky radio sources up to z ∼ 5.
We separate the radio population into three main types: star-forming galaxies, and two types of
AGN based on their X-ray, infrared emission, and host galaxy colors. In Section 2 we present the
dataset. The classiﬁcation of the radio source components is described in Section 3. The results of
the separation, and their interpretation in the context of the sources’ physical properties follow in
Section 4. Finally, in Section 5 we discuss the composition of the faint radio source population.

2. Data

2.1 Radio Data

The VLA-COSMOS 3GHz Large Project encompasses 384 hours of observations with the
Karl J. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in S-band (centered at 3 GHz with 2,048 MHz bandwidth)
as described in detail in Smolˇci´c et al. (in prep). The source component catalog was extracted
from the 2.6 deg2 3 GHz map, and contains 10,899 components with a local signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR)≥ 5. Within the 2 deg2 of the COSMOS ﬁeld, the median rms is ∼ 2.3 m Jy/beam, at a
resolution of 0.75′′.

2.2 Mid-infrared - near-ultraviolet data and redshifts

We here use the photometry and photometric redshift catalogs (COSMOS2015 hereafter) de-
scribed by Laigle et al. (submitted). These contain 1,182,108 sources detected in the map resulting
from the chi-squared sum of Y JHKS and Subaru z++ images, where Y JHKS is taken from Ultra-
VISTA DR21. The COSMOS2015 catalog lists optical and NIR photometry in over 30 bands for
each source. Laigle et al. have computed photometric redshifts for the sources using LEPHARE
(see also Ilbert et al. 2009, 2013). Using the full COSMOS spectroscopic data, they report a photo-
metric redshift accuracy of s D z/(1+zs) = 0.007 with respect to zCOSMOS (Lilly et al., 2007), and
s D z/(1+zs) = 0.021 for 3 < z < 6 (cf. Table 4 in Laigle et al., submitted). The VLA-COSMOS
3GHz Large Project mosaic with overlaid masked areas (due to saturation from stars, and map
edges) in the optical-NIR data is shown in Fig. 1. The resulting effective area with accurate UV-
NIR photometry is 1.8 deg2.

We use the latest spectroscopic redshift catalog available to the COSMOS team (M. Salvato
in prep.). The catalog compiles a range of spectroscopic surveys of the COSMOS ﬁeld, including
SDSS (DR12; Alam et al. 2015), zCOSMOS (PI: S. Lilly), VIMOS Ultra Deep Survey (VUDS; Le
Fèvre et al. 2015), MOSFIRE (Scoville et al. 2015 in prep.), MOSDEF (Kriek et al., 2015), and
DEIMOS2.

2.3 X-ray data

We use the most recent COSMOS X-ray catalog of point sources (Marchesi et al., 2016), drawn
from the Chandra COSMOS-Legacy survey (Civano et al., 2016). The Chandra COSMOS-Legacy
survey combines the Chandra COSMOS (Elvis et al., 2009) data with the new Chandra ACIS-I

data (2.8 Ms observing time) resulting in a total exposure time of 4.6 Ms over 2.15 deg2 area,
reaching a [0.5 - 2] keV limiting depth of 2.2×10−16 erg s−1 cm−2, and 8.9×10−16 erg s−1 cm−2
in the [0.5 - 10] keV band (Civano et al., 2016). The catalog contains 4,016 X-ray point sources in
the Chandra COSMOS-Legacy survey, out of which 3,877 have optical–MIR counterpart (March-
esi et al., 2016). For these latter, spectroscopic (see Civano et al. 2016), or photometric redshifs
(Salvato et al. in prep.) are available. The catalog lists X-ray ﬂuxes, and intrinsic (i.e. unobscured)
X-ray luminosities in the full [0.5 - 10] keV, soft [0.5 - 2] keV, and hard [2 - 10] keV X-ray bands.

3. Multi-wavelength counterparts of VLA-COSMOS 3GHz Large Project source

components

3.1 MIR - Optical counterparts

Out of 10,899 radio source components in the 3 GHz map, 8,750 (80%) fall within the un-
masked 1.8 deg2 area in the optical–NIR maps (see Fig. 1, and Sec. 2), where the most accurate
photometry and photometric redshifts are available. We then positionally match those radio source
components with the sources listed in the COSMOS2015 catalog using a 0.4′′ matching radius.
This yields 7,122/8,750 (81%) matches. We estimate a false match probability of . 2% based
on a positional match of 10,899 randomly positioned sources. We have veriﬁed that photometric
redshift accuracies for our radio-COSMOS2015 matched sources (s D z/(1+zs) = 0.01) are in agree-
ment with the accuracies given by Laigle et al. (see Sec. 2.2). To select only sources with the most
accurate photometric redshifts, we have introduced a cut in i-band magnitude of mi ≤ 25.5 (Ilbert
et al., 2009). This reduces our sample to 6,214 radio sources with MIR-optical counterparts. Spec-
troscopic redshifts are available for 2,553 (41%) sources, while 3,661 (59%) have only photometric
redshifts. The photometric redshift distribution of the matched sources is shown in the Fig. 2.

3.2 X-ray counterparts

Of the 6,214 sources from the radio - COSMOS2015 dataset, 816 (13%) are associated with
the X-ray point sources (see Sec. 2.3) according to the X-ray - optical - MIR matched catalog of
Marchesi et al. (2016).

4. Radio source classiﬁcation

4.1 X-ray AGN

We consider all sources in our sample with intrinsic X-ray full band [0.5 - 8] keV luminosity
(LX ) above log(LX /erg s−1) = 42 to be X-ray AGN (e.g., Szokoly et al. 2004). From a total of
6,214 sources, 767 (∼ 13%) are selected as X-ray AGN. This amounts to 94% of the full radio-X-
ray sample, as deﬁned in Section 3.2.

4.2 Mid-infrared AGN

To complement the X-ray AGN selection criterion, we apply the MIR-based selection method
of Donley et al. (2012). This method identiﬁes the warm dusty tori surrounding the central SMBH,
using the range of colors constructed from four IRAC bands at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and 8 m m (see Donley

4

SF galaxies vs. radio AGN in VLA-COSMOS 3GHz Large Project

N. Baran

et al. 2012 for details). Using this method, we ﬁnd 365 MIR-identiﬁed AGN in total, out of which
201 were also identiﬁed as X-ray AGN. Although ∼18% of the sources classiﬁed as X-ray AGN
also satisfy MIR AGN criteria, ∼ 3% of sources in our sample ﬁt MIR AGN criterion only. Thus,
both MIR and X-ray AGN selection criteria are required to reach a more complete perspective of
radiatively efﬁcient AGN activity in our radio sample.

4.3 Rest-frame optical colors as a proxy for star-forming and quiescent galaxies

We ﬁnd that in 4,431 (∼ 85%) of the 6,214 radio-selected sources in our sample do not display
signatures of AGN activity in the X-ray or MIR. We therefore assume that emission of the host
galaxy (and not that of AGN) dominates their optical-MIR spectrum of these objects. To separate
galaxies based on their extent of star-formation activity, we use a rest-frame optical color-based
separation method, already used and tested by Ilbert et al. (2010). This method separates sources
based on the their near ultraviolet (NUV ) and r rest-frame colors (MNUV − Mr) corrected for in-
ternal dust extinction (see Ilbert et al. 2010 for details). Sources are considered quiescent (red) if
MNUV − Mr > 3.5, having intermediate star-formation activity (green) if 3.5 > MNUV − Mr > 1.2,
and having high star-formation activity (blue) if MNUV − Mr < 1.2. By applying the method to the
4,431 sources that were not selected as X-ray or MIR AGN, we ﬁnd 1,595 intermediate, and 2,836
high-activity galaxies, which, as shown below can be considered as star-forming galaxies. Further,
we ﬁnd 852 red, quiescent galaxies.

4.4 Physical properties of differently selected radio source populations

Radiation arising from AGN carries a signature of physical mechanisms at play. In the ab-
sence of spectral information which would directly prove the (non)existence of high-excitation
optical emission lines, we assess the radiative efﬁciency of accretion using proxies derived from
X-ray, MIR and rest-frame optical emission. We thereby separate AGN population into HERAGN
dominated, and LERAGN dominated sub-populations.

HERAGN are thought to have radiatively efﬁcient modes of accretion (see Evans et al. 2006,
Smolˇci´c 2009, Best & Heckman 2012). Signatures of radiatively efﬁcient accretion include a
powerful X-ray emission, and MIR emission if a warm dusty torus is present around the central
SMBH (Donley et al., 2012). Thus, we expect the X-ray, and MIR identiﬁed AGN sources to be
predominantly consistent with properties of HERAGN.

LERAGN are radiatively inefﬁcient AGN (Hine & Longair, 1979), and do not display prop-
erties consistent with the uniﬁed model of AGN (Smolˇci´c, 2009), remaining mostly undetected
in X-ray and MIR. In the local Universe, LERAGN are hosted by optically red galaxies (Evans
et al. 2006, Smolˇci´c 2009, see also Smolˇci´c 2016, this Volume). Since the red rest-frame color
indicates a low level of star-formation, consistent with quiescent galaxies, the radio emission from
non-HERAGN radio sources with red rest-frame optical colors likely arises from AGN activity.
Thus, we expect that red non-HERAGN radio sources are predominantly LERAGN.

For radio sources that do not display characteristics of AGN, we assume most of radio emission
is arising from the supernovae explosions within the galaxies, linked to their star-formation rate
(Ulvestad, 1982). Therefore we classify as a non-active star-forming galaxy any radio source in
our sample that displays green or blue optical colors (hence has intermediate to high levels of

star formation activity) and is not previously identiﬁed as LERAGN or HERAGN. This has been
veriﬁed by Delhaize at al. (in prep.) who ﬁnd that such objects closely follow the infrared-radio
correlation of star-forming galaxies.

We have compared our classiﬁcation with the results based on the spectral energy distribution
(SED) ﬁtting, performed on the same sample by I. Delvecchio et al. (in prep.). They use an updated
set of MAGPHYS templates suitable to ﬁt the SED of galaxies hosting an AGN as well as regular
galaxies (da Cunha et al. 2008, Berta et al. 2013). In addition to the X-ray and MIR-selected AGN,
as deﬁned here, they identify further AGN, based only on the SED ﬁtting results (Delvecchio
et al., 2014). A comparison with their method suggests that our X-ray+MIR-AGN sample is about
70% complete. This is consistent with the ﬁndings based on Very Large Baseline Array (VLBA)
(PI: E. Middleberg, see Herrera-Ruiz et al. in prep.) point source catalog at 1.4 GHz. Out of 468
VLBA sources in total, we ﬁnd 301 positional matches with our radio-COSMOS2015 sample in a
0.1′′ radius, where 203 (67%) have already been selected as AGN. Since VLBA point sources are
very compact (∼1/100′′ resolution) they can be considered either as compact starburst regions or
AGN. The SFR analysis points to the latter as the source of the radio emission (e.g., Delvecchio et
al., in prep). The lack of AGN features from SED ﬁtting further suggests the predominantly lower
radiative efﬁciency of our red galaxy (LERAGN dominated) sample, with respect to our X-ray and
MIR-selected AGN. This is consistent with the results from Delhaize et al. (in prep.) who ﬁnd a
signiﬁcant radio excess with respect to star-formation rate for our red, quiescent galaxy population,
thus conﬁrming its properties are dominated by LERAGN. A slight radio excess in HERAGN
is also notable, while blue and green galaxies show no radio excess, and are, thus, considered
predominantly star-forming. Our classiﬁcation scheme is summarized in Table 1.

5. Composition of the sub-millijansky radio source population

After separating the 3 GHz radio sources into three distinct categories, we study their fractional
contributions to the total number of sources as a function of 3 GHz radio ﬂux. This is shown in
Fig. 3. It is notable that above ∼ 400m Jy the LERAGN dominate, followed by HERAGN and star-
forming galaxies. Below ∼ 200m Jy the situation reverses, and star-forming galaxies dominate the
fraction while low-excitation sources contribute the least. This is consistent with previous results
from Smolˇci´c et al. 2008, Mignano et al. 2008, Bonzini et al. 2013 and Padovani et al. 2015.

In summary, we have classiﬁed objects detected in the VLA-COSMOS 3GHz Large Project
into sub-populations dominated by high- and low-excitation radio AGN, and star-forming galaxies,

using their X-ray, MIR, and rest-frame optical colors. We have thereby examined the composition
of the sub-millijansky radio source population as a function of 3 GHz ﬂux.
