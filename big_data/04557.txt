ABSTRACT
As star-forming clouds collapse, the gas within them fragments to ever-smaller masses, until
the cascade of fragmentation is arrested at some mass scale, making smaller objects progres-
sively less likely to form. This scale deﬁnes the peak of the initial mass function (IMF). In
this paper we analyse radiation-magnetohydrodynamics simulations of star cluster formation
in typical Milky Way environments in order to determine what physical process limits frag-
mentation in them. We examine the regions in the vicinity of stars that form in the simulations
to determine the amounts of mass that are prevented from fragmenting by thermal and mag-
netic pressure. We show that, on small scales, thermal pressure enhanced by stellar radiation
heating is the dominant mechanism limiting the ability of the gas to further fragment. In the
brown dwarf mass regime, ∼ 0.01 M(cid:12), the typical object that forms in the simulations is sur-
rounded by gas whose mass is several times its own that is unable to escape or fragment, and
instead is likely to accrete. This mechanism explains why ∼ 0.01 M(cid:12) objects are rare: unless
an outside agent intervenes (e.g., a shock strips away the gas around them), they will grow by
accreting the warmed gas around them. In contrast, by the time stars grow to masses of ∼ 0.2
M(cid:12), the mass of heated gas is only tens of percent of the central star mass, too small to alter
its ﬁnal mass by a large factor. This naturally explains why the IMF peak is at ∼ 0.2 − 0.3
M(cid:12).

INTRODUCTION

The origin of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) is one of
the outstanding problems in contemporary theoretical astrophysics
(Krumholz 2014; Offner et al. 2014). The observed IMF displays a
characteristic peak at ∼ 0.2 − 0.3 M(cid:12), with a decline in the num-
ber of objects on either side of this plateau (Kroupa 2002; Chabrier
2003, 2005; Bastian, Covey & Meyer 2010; Parravano, McKee &
Hollenbach 2011; Offner et al. 2014). This peak appears to be uni-
versal or nearly so within the Milky Way, and even in the most ex-
treme environments to which we have access its location is different
by at most a factor of ∼ 2 − 3 (e.g., van Dokkum & Conroy 2010,
2011; Cappellari et al. 2012; Spiniello et al. 2012, 2015; Conroy
et al. 2013).

The origin of this mass scale is far from clear. Stars form in a

turbulent, magnetised, radiating medium. Given this complexity, it
is not surprising that a number of theoretical models have been pro-
posed, emphasising different physical mechanisms as providing the
key element. For example, some authors propose that the location
of the peak is set by the thermal Jeans mass in nearly-isothermal
star-forming clouds, in which case the key physical process is what-
ever determines the mean density of the isothermal gas (e.g., Lar-
son 1992; Bate & Bonnell 2005; Clark et al. 2005; Bonnell, Clarke
& Bate 2006), and neither turbulence, nor magnetic ﬁelds, nor ra-
diative transfer are important processes. Others add turbulence to
this picture, proposing that the peak of the IMF is instead set by
the Jeans mass evaluated at a characteristic density set by turbu-
lent compression (e.g., Padoan & Nordlund 2002; Hennebelle &
Chabrier 2008, 2009, 2013; Hopkins 2012, 2013a,b). Yet other au-
thors have emphasised the role of radiative processes in suppress-
ing fragmentation below a critical mass, thereby picking out the
location of the IMF peak that way (e.g., Whitworth, Bofﬁn & Fran-
cis 1998; Larson 2005; Jappsen et al. 2005; Krumholz 2006, 2011;

Krumholz et al.

Bate 2009, 2012; Offner et al. 2009; Krumholz, Klein & McKee
2011, 2012; Guszejnov, Krumholz & Hopkins 2016).

On top of all these processes, the characteristic mass scale can
be shifted lower by both protostellar outﬂows (Hansen et al. 2012;
Krumholz, Klein & McKee 2012) and strong magnetic ﬁelds. The
former eject mass directly, while the latter lower accretion rates and
inhibit the formation of massive collapsing regions (Li et al. 2010;
Hocuk et al. 2012).1

The difﬁculty of teasing out the physics that is responsible for
setting the IMF is partly driven by the fact that most simulations to
date do not include all the possibly-important effects. While there
are a large number of simulations including turbulence and gravity,
there are relatively few that also include magnetic ﬁelds, radiative
transfer, and protostellar outﬂows, and even fewer that combine all
of these elements. The only published studies reporting radiation-
magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the formation of multiple
stars are those of Price & Bate (2009), Commerc¸on et al. (2011),
Peters et al. (2011), and Myers et al. (2013, 2014). Only the last
of these both includes protostellar outﬂows and, most importantly,
forms enough stars that one can obtain meaningful statistics from
it, albeit only in the vicinity near the IMF peak that is best sampled.
In this paper we use the simulations of Myers et al. (2014) to
study what physical processes are responsible for determining how
the gas fragments, and thus for setting the location of the IMF peak.
Our strategy is to examine in detail the gas in the vicinity of each
forming star, starting from the instant at which a collapsed object
appears and following as it accretes, with the goal of measuring
the relative importance of magnetic and thermal support, and, for
the latter, the importance of radiative effects in raising or lower-
ing the level of thermal support. This zoom-in on cores approach
is quite similar to that employed by Bonnell, Vine & Bate (2004)
and Smith, Longmore & Bonnell (2009), with the difference that
we have access to simulations that include a much wider range of
physical processes, enabling much stronger conclusions.

The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. In Sec-
tion 2 we review the properties of the simulations and then discuss
our analysis method. We present the results of our analysis in Sec-
tion 3, and discuss their implications in Section 4. We summarise
and conclude in Section 5.

2 ANALYSIS
2.1 Summary of the Simulations

We analyse the simulations published by Myers et al. (2014). We
refer readers to that paper for a full description of the simulations,
and here simply summarise details that will become relevant be-
low. All simulations include radiative transfer (including stellar ra-
diation feedback), and begin from initial conditions produced by
driving turbulence in a periodic box in order to let it reach statis-
tical equilibirum before turning on self-gravity. Myers et al. con-
sidered three different initial magnetic ﬁeld strengths: no magnetic
ﬁeld (referred to as the “hydro” case), a “weak” ﬁeld case with
an initial mass to ﬂux ratio equal to 10 times the critical value
for gravitational collapse, and a “strong” ﬁeld case with an initial
mass to ﬂux ratio set to twice the critical value for collapse. We use

1 Once a collapsing region does form, however, the ﬁeld appears to have
the opposite effect, suppressing fragmentation and favouring formation of
more massive stars (Hennebelle et al. 2011; Commerc¸on, Hennebelle &
Henning 2011; Myers et al. 2013).

the high-resolution versions of these simulations, which have ﬁnest
cells of 23 AU. Once gas is Jeans unstable even at this resolution,
we replace it with an accreting sink particle (Krumholz, McKee &
Klein 2004) that is coupled to a protostellar evolution calculation
(Offner et al. 2009) and injects radiation and winds (Cunningham
et al. 2011) back into the computational domain. The accretion pro-
cess removes mass but not magnetic ﬂux from the computational
domain, and thereby decreases the mass to ﬂux ratio inside the
accretion region around the sink particle. Sink particles track the
angular momentum of the material they accrete, and thus have a
well-deﬁned spin axis. All simulations use a computational domain
containing 1000 M(cid:12) of gas in a periodic domain 0.46 pc on a side,
giving an initial mean density of nH = 3.0 × 105 H nuclei cm−3,
and a column density Σ = 4700 M(cid:12) pc−2 = 1 g cm−2. The initial
gas temperature is 10 K, and the initial magnetic ﬁeld strengths are
0.16 and 0.81 mG in the weak and strong ﬁeld runs, respectively.
By the end of these simulations, the hydro, weak, and strong runs
have formed 100, 74, and 70 stars, respectively.

2.2 Core Proﬁles and Critical Masses

We are interested in determining the role of thermal pressure (both
with and without radiative transfer effects) and magnetic support
in inhibiting fragmentation in the collapsing regions in our simu-
lations. To this end, we identify every sink particle at each output
time slice, and use the yt software package (Turk et al. 2011) to
compute a series of quantities. We examine 128 concentric spheri-
cal shells centred on each sink particle, with the inner edge of the
innermost shell placed at a distance of 100 AU from the particle
and the most distant at 4000 AU. For each shell, we compute the to-
tal gas mass enclosed mgas (excluding the sink particle), the mean
density ρ, and, in order to assess the amount of thermal support,
the mass-weighted mean isothermal sound speed cs. We compute
these quantities both cumulatively, meaning that we take the mass
and mean sound speed of all gas within the shell, and differentially,
meaning that we consider only the material between two shells. We
show in Appendix A that the results for using either method are
qualitatively the same, and so for the remainder of the paper we
will focus on the cumulative quantities, which are somewhat less
noisy. From ρ and cs, we compute the Bonnor-Ebert mass (Ebert
1955; Bonnor 1956),

(cid:115)

mBE = 1.86

(1)

and we therefore have mBE as a function of radius around each
sink particle. Note that the coefﬁcient here is 1.86 rather than the
more familiar 1.18 because we are using the mean density rather
than the surface density; in the isothermal case, this is a factor of
2.465 higher (McKee & Holliman 1999), explaining the increased
coefﬁcient. The Bonnor-Ebert mass characterises the level of ther-
mal support in the gas; objects with a mass less that mBE are stable
against collapse. Note that, since the Bonnor-Ebert mass has been
computed for isothermal gas (or more generally for polytropic gas
– McKee & Holliman 1999), while our gas is neither isothermal
nor polytropic, this calculation of the mass that can be supported is
only approximate. Nonetheless, it should provide a useful estimate
of the importance of thermal pressure support.

To assess the importance of radiative heating by stars, we re-
peat the computation of the Bonnor-Ebert mass with the sound
speed ﬁxed to cs = 0.19 km s−1, the sound speed for molecu-
lar gas at 10 K, the background temperature in the simulations, and

Finally, the key quantity in determining magnetic ﬁelds’ abil-
ity to inhibit fragmentation is the ﬂux Φ. We record Φ over a series
of 128 circular areas centred on the sink particle, with the outer
edges of the circles lying on the spheres used in the computation of
the enclosed mass and mBE. We perform this operation on circular
areas with 12 different orientations in space, one aligned with the
angular momentum vector of the sink particle, and the remaining 11
distributed uniformly following the HEALPix pixelisation scheme
(G´orski et al. 2005). For each circular area we record the ﬂux in
whichever orientation produces the largest value, and we compute
from the absolute value of the magnetic ﬁeld dotted with the sur-
face normal, |B· ˆn|, on the assumption that oppositely-directed ﬂux
tubes should not be able to reconnect and cancel.

From the ﬂux we compute the magnetic critical mass

and the magnetically-supported mass (Mouschovias & Spitzer
1976; McKee & Ostriker 2007)

.

(3)

As with mBE and mBE,10, we have this quantity as a function of
radius for each sink particle.2 Note that the coefﬁcient 1/2π used
in equation 2 depends on the exact density and magnetic ﬁeld dis-
tribution, and can vary in the range ≈ 0.12 − 0.18 (Tomisaka,
Ikeuchi & Nakamura 1988; Tomisaka 1998; McKee & Ostriker
2007). Our choice 1/2π ≈ 0.16 is appropriate for an inﬁnite thin
sheet (Nakano & Nakamura 1978), but lies near the upper end of
the plausible range, and therefore likely gives an upper limit on the
strength of magnetic support.

Figure 1 shows an example of the types of proﬁles we gener-
ate, for a core around a 0.17 M(cid:12) star in the strong magnetic ﬁeld
run. In addition to the density, we show the effective temperature
and magnetic ﬁeld, deﬁned by

(5)

Thus Teﬀ and Beﬀ are the uniform temperature and magnetic ﬁeld
that would produce a sound speed and magnetic ﬂux, respectively,
equal to the mass-weighted mean sound speed and magnetic ﬂux
with radius r that we measure. For Beﬀ, we show the value derived
using both our preferred deﬁnition of Φ, where we take the abso-
lute value of the ﬁeld component normal to the surface and thus
disregard cancellation of oppositely-directed ﬂux tubes, and a re-
sult computing allowing cancellation, in order to illustrate that the
difference between them is minor.

The ﬁnal panel of Figure 1 shows the proﬁles of the enclosed
mass mgas, as well as the masses mBE, mBE,10 and mB that can be
supported by thermal pressure with and without radiative heating,

2 We use mB rather than using mΦ as our estimator of magnetic support
because mB is more analogous to mBE, in that both mB and mBE are
intensive quantities. The value of mBE depends on the local density and
temperature and thus does not change if we consider different volumes of
constant density and temperature. Similarly. the ratio mB/mgas depends
only on the mass to ﬂux ratio Φ/mgas, and thus does not vary if we consider
volumes of varying size but ﬁxed mass to ﬂux ratio. In contrast, the total ﬂux
Φ and thus mΦ are extensive quantities that do depend on the size of the
volume considered, even if the conditions are uniform.

Figure 1. Example of the density, effective temperature, effective magnetic
ﬁeld strength, and mass proﬁles around a 0.17 M(cid:12) protostar, in a sim-
ulation with 23 AU resolution. The top panel show the mean density of
the material enclosed within each radius. The next two panels show the
temperature and magnetic ﬁeld strength that would yield values equal to
the mass-weighted mean sound speed and mean magnetic ﬂux interior to
that radius, respectively. In the ﬁnal panel, the solid line shows the mass of
gas enclosed, the thick dashed line shows the Bonnor-Ebert mass computed
from the mass-weighted mean sound speed and mean density, the dotted
line shows the Bonnor-Ebert mass computed from the mean density using a
ﬁxed gas temperature of 10 K, and the dot-dashed line shows the magnetic
critical mass.

the temperature that the gas would have in the absence of radia-
tive heating. We refer to this quantity as mBE,10. Note that this is
an imperfect proxy for the effects of radiative heating, because the
densities that go into mBE,10 have still been derived from a simu-
lation including radiative heating and its effects on the dynamics.
Compared to what would be obtained in a purely isothermal so-
lution, this should generally produce lower mBE,10, because the
increased pressure produced by radiative heating will tend to lower
densities. Thus if anything our method underestimates the effects
of radiative heating on supporting the gas.

and by magnetic pressure, respectively. From these measured pro-
ﬁles, we can compute three critical masses mBE,crit, mBE,10,crit
and mB,crit, deﬁned as the masses enclosed within the shells where
mBE, mBE,10 and mB are equal to mgas. That is, we ﬁnd the inter-
section of the solid line in Figure 1 with the three other lines. The
physical meanings of these critical masses are clear. The enclosed
mass mgas is a strictly increasing function of radius and approaches
0 as r → 0. The other masses remain ﬁnite as r → 0, so that at
sufﬁciently small r, mgas is less than the masses that can be sup-
ported by thermal or magnetic pressure. Thus the gas at small r
is unable to collapse on its own and form another protostar; given
its proximity to an existing star, it is likely to be accreted instead.
On other hand, at sufﬁciently large radii the enclosed gas mass is
greater than can be supported by thermal or magnetic pressure, and
thus could at least potentially fragment to form another star rather
than be accreted. Thus the critical masses provide rough estimates
of the mass that will be added to the star by accretion. Large criti-
cal masses likely imply the formation of more massive stars, while
small critical masses at least hold open the possibility of forming
lower mass stars or brown dwarfs.

It is worth cautioning at this point that there are signiﬁcant
uncertainties in this calculation. The quantities we use to estimate
the mass that can be supported against collapse – mBE, mBE,10,
and mB – are computed for gas subject only to its own self-gravity,
not subject to an external tidal ﬁeld. However, since we are ex-
amining gas near a young star, there is a tidal ﬁeld, whose impor-
tance will grow as the ratio of the stellar mass to the critical mass
grows. Nonetheless, our estimates should be very accurate at the
early stage when mcrit may be large compared to m∗, and this is
the phase of most interest to us. We wish to understand what forces
prevent gas that is in the vicinity of a newborn protostar from frag-
menting to form another protostar, rather than accreting onto and
thus increasing the mass of the ﬁrst one.

Finally, note that we do not consider turbulent support in our
analysis, a choice that is justiﬁed on observational, theoretical, and
practical grounds. Observationally, the cores out of which low mass
stars form are always observed to have signiﬁcantly sub-thermal
velocity dispersions, suggesting that turbulent support is unimpor-
tant (Goodman et al. 1998; Pineda et al. 2010). Theoretically, while
turbulent support clearly can delay global collapse, it does not ap-
pear to be able to prevent collapse entirely, nor does it prevent frag-
mentation to small objects in those regions that do collapse. Thus
for the purposes of determining a minimum mass scale for frag-
mentation, it is unclear that turbulent support should be included.
Finally, as a practical matter the velocity ﬁelds in the vicinity of
forming stars in our simulations are, not surprisingly, dominated
by infall motions, and it is difﬁcult to disentangle these from turbu-
lence. Thus we cannot easily form a useful estimate of the amount
of turbulent support from our simulations.

2.3 Averaged Quantities

Once we have computed the proﬁles and critical masses in the
vicinity of every star, the next step is to compute mean values over
all the stars in a given simulation. We bin the means by the mass
of the star around which the core is found, so that we can study the
evolution of proﬁles and critical masses with the mass of the central
object. Formally, we measure a quantity q at a series of output times
ti in our simulations for each star present at that time; the stars have
mass m∗,i,j, where i indexes the output time and j indexes the star
at that time. We deﬁne the average of q for a particular bin in central
star mass [m∗,k, m∗,k+1) by

,

(cid:104)q(cid:105)k =
(6)
where the sum over j runs over all stars with mass m∗,i,j ∈
[m∗,k, m∗,k+1). Intuitively, (cid:104)q(cid:105)k is an average over all the stars in a
particular mass bin, with each star weighted by the time it spends in
that mass bin. An alternative approach would be to average each ob-
ject over the time it spends in a given mass bin and then average all
objects equally. However, we prefer the approach of weighting in
time because this most closely matches the average of what would
be observed, since the probability of observing a particular state of
evolution depends on its duration. Note that q can be either a scalar
quantity (e.g., mBE,crit) or a function of distance away from the
star (e.g., ρ(r)). In all the analysis presented in this simulation, we
use 15 logarithmically-spaced bins from 10−2 − 0.25 M(cid:12) for our
analysis, thereby sampling from the mass where objects undergo
second collapse to stellar density (Masunaga & Inutsuka 2000) up
to the peak of the IMF. This is the phase we are interested in ex-
ploring, because it is during this phase that the peak of the IMF is
determined.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Mean Proﬁles of Density, Temperature, and Magnetic

Field

We ﬁrst examine the mean proﬁles of density (cid:104)ρ(cid:105), effective tem-
perature (cid:104)Teﬀ(cid:105), and effective magnetic ﬁeld (cid:104)Beﬀ(cid:105) in the vicinity
of each protostar, as a function of protostellar mass. At this early
phase of the evolution, when the protostar’s mass is small, its ﬁ-
nal mass is likely to be determined by whether the gas around it
accretes or fragments to form another star. We show the proﬁles
we measure for the density, temperature, and magnetic ﬁeld from
all three simulations, and for three different central star masses, in
Figure 2 (density), Figure 3 (temperature), and Figure 4 (magnetic
ﬁeld).

These ﬁgures enable a few immediate conclusions. First, ex-
amining Figure 2, we ﬁnd that cores have a density proﬁle that is
always close to ρ−3/2, excluding the very smallest radii where the
density drops due to numerical effects – the accretion zone around
each sink particle in our simulations is 92 AU in radius, and the pro-
tostellar injection region extends to roughly twice this size, so the
density inside ∼ 150 AU is artiﬁcially altered. In the Strong and
Weak runs, the normalisation of the density proﬁle is either non-
evolving or very close to it as stars gain mass, while in the Hydro
case it shows a weak increase with central object mass. The slope is
consistent with what would be expected for free-fall collapse onto
a point mass, but the non-evolution of the proﬁle with mass is not,
since for a Bondi-type ﬂow the density at a ﬁxed distance from the
central object increases with mass. The density slope and the lack
of evolution in the normalisation with central object mass (and thus,
for a single object, with time) is consistent with the turbulent core
model of McKee & Tan (2003), and with the model of Murray &
Chang (2015) for the structure of a self-gravitating, turbulent, col-
lapsing ﬂow in the region near the centre of the collapse. Finally, we
note that the densities are quite similar in all runs, indicating that
the magnetic ﬁeld has little effect on the density structure around
cores. We shall see why this might be below.

Figure 3 shows that the temperature, in contrast to the density,
evolves signiﬁcantly as protostars grow. This is not surprising: for
a constant density proﬁle, the accretion rate onto stars is increas-
ing with time because infall velocities get larger. Since accretion

Figure 2. Mean density proﬁles (cid:104)ρ(r)(cid:105) (deﬁned per equation 6) around protostars. Different panels show the results for the Strong magnetic ﬁeld, Weak
magnetic ﬁeld, and Hydrodynamic runs, as indicated. Different colours show means for protostars of mass 0.01 M(cid:12), 0.05 M(cid:12), and 0.25 M(cid:12), respectively.
For each mass bin, the central, thick line shows the mean, while the shaded band shows the 1σ dispersion of proﬁles in that mass bin. The shaded region is
missing for the highest mass bin in the hydro run, because only a single star is in that bin, and thus a dispersion cannot be computed. The black dashed line,
ρ ∝ r−1.5, is the same in every panel. It is not a ﬁt, but is simply meant to guide the eye. The declines of the proﬁles inside ∼ 150 AU are probably artiﬁcially
imposed by the sink particle accretion and protostellar outﬂow injection algorithms, which alter the density proﬁle on scales of a few computational zones;
each zone is 23 AU in size.

luminosity is the dominant luminosity source for these low mass
stars, they get brighter with time, and thus the temperature around
them rises. However, note that there is non-trivial heating out to
hundreds of AU even for the smallest stellar mass bin we consider,
∼ 0.01 M(cid:12). That heating is important even at such small masses
was ﬁrst pointed out by Krumholz (2006) based on analytic calcu-
lations, and by Offner et al. (2009) and Bate (2009) using simu-
lations. The slopes of the temperature proﬁles change with central
object mass as well, being near Teﬀ ∝ r−0.3 for the 0.05 M(cid:12)
bin, somewhat shallower at lower central object masses, and some-
what steeper at higher masses. It is worth noting that these temper-
atures, while signiﬁcantly elevated, are still nowhere near enough
to present a barrier to accretion onto the central object. Even for
∼ 0.01 M(cid:12) central objects, the sound speed is a factor of several
smaller than the escape speed from the gas and central star over the
entire range of radii we consider, and this difference increases for
the more massive central objects.

Finally, Figure 4 shows the effective magnetic ﬁeld strength
(deﬁned as the uniform magnetic ﬁeld that would produce a ﬂux

c(cid:13) 2015 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–10

equal to that we measure) in the two magnetised runs. It is inter-
esting to note that the magnetic ﬁeld proﬁles are quite similar in
the two runs, despite the factor of 5 difference in the initial ﬁeld
strengths. In the strong ﬁeld run, the effective magnetic ﬁeld has
fallen back to the background value by distances of ∼ 2000 AU
from the star, while in the weak ﬁeld run it remains elevated over
the background even out to 4000 AU, but the actual ﬁeld strengths
at small radii are similar. Both scale with distance as roughly
Beﬀ ∝ r−1 at small radii, ﬂattening to closer to Beﬀ ∝ r−2/3 at
larger radii. The ﬁeld does not increase signiﬁcantly with protostel-
lar mass. The lack of variation in the local ﬁeld strength with either
the large-scale magnetic ﬁeld or the protostellar mass could have
two possible causes. First, the ﬁeld in the gravitationally-collapsing
regions immediately around the protostars could be the result not

dynamo operating on small scales in the accretion ﬂow around the
stars (Sur et al. 2012; Li, McKee & Klein 2015). This mechanism
would amplify the ﬁeld up to some saturation level, and would nat-
urally explain why the ﬁeld strength does not depend on the large-

scale ﬁeld. Second, the ﬁeld could be dominated by ﬂux advected
into the region around the young stars, but this could be modulated
by the escape of ﬂux via magnetic interchange instability, whereby
ﬁeld lines that are drained of mass become buoyant and rise away
from accreting protostars (Zhao et al. 2011; Krasnopolsky et al.
2012; Li et al. 2014). This would explain the lack of growth of
ﬁeld with stellar mass. Regardless of the underlying mechanism,
however, our result strongly suggests that the magnetic ﬁelds in
the vicinity of young stars, those that are responsible for regulating
fragmentation, are determined by a local process that is insensitive
to the large-scale magnetic ﬂux.

3.2 Critical Masses

We now ask how magnetic and thermal forces support gas against
gravitational collapse. As discussed in Section 2.2, for each core
at each time we can identify the radius and mass for which the
enclosed mass is equal to the Bonnor-Ebert mass mBE,crit, the
Bonnor-Ebert mass computed using a ﬁxed temperature of 10 K
mBE,10,crit, and the magnetic critical mass, mB,crit. We show the
averages of these quantities as a function of central star mass in
Figure 5.

From this plot we can immediately draw a few conclusions.
First, comparing the lines for mBE and mBE,10, we see that heat-
ing of the gas by stellar radiation dramatically increases the amount
of mass that can be supported against fragmentation. This increase
is a factor of ∼ 3 even for the lowest mass stars near 0.01 M(cid:12), and
becomes an order of magnitude by the time the star has grown to
∼ 0.2 M(cid:12). This dramatic suppression of fragmentation at early
times by radiative heating is consistent with the arguments ﬁrst
made by Krumholz (2006), and is not surprising given the suppres-
sion of fragmentation routinely seen in radiation-hydrodynamic
simulations.

Perhaps more surprising is the relative unimportance of mag-
netic ﬁelds in providing support, even in the most strongly magne-
tised simulation we consider, and even with the relatively generous
assumptions we have made in estimating magnetic support (e.g.,
ignoring cancelling magnetic ﬂuxes, using a large coefﬁcient in
the computation of mΦ). While magnetic ﬁelds can support about
half an order of magnitude more mass than could thermal pressure
at a ﬁxed temperature of 10 K, once we include radiative heating

they provide an amount of support that is only comparable to ther-
mal pressure for stars with mass (cid:46) 0.05 M(cid:12), and that is decid-
edly less important than thermal pressure for more massive stars.
In the weak ﬁeld run magnetic ﬁelds are less important than ther-
mal pressure at essentially all stellar masses. The relative unim-
portance of magnetic support highlights the fact that the magnetic
critical mass measured over large scales is not a particularly good
guide to how important magnetic ﬁelds might be in shaping the
IMF. In the strong ﬁeld run, the magnetic ﬁeld threading the entire
computational domain is sufﬁcient to prevent a mass mΦ = 500
M(cid:12) from collapsing. However, the mass threading the few thou-
sand AU-sized regions we are considering is far smaller than this,
and can hold up far less mass. Turbulence in the simulations is able
to gather mass along ﬁeld lines and possibly also induce turbulent
reconnection (Lazarian & Vishniac 1999; Santos-Lima et al. 2010),
locally increasing the mass to ﬂux ratio and creating regions where
magnetic pressure becomes unimportant in comparison to thermal
pressure.

Indeed, we note that the relative unimportance of magnetic
ﬁelds as opposed to radiation in preventing fragmentation on small
scales around stars, as opposed to the formation of additional stars
far from existing ones, is consistent with the ﬁndings of radiation-
magnetohydrodynamic simulations (Commerc¸on, Hennebelle &
Henning 2011; Myers et al. 2013). These show that radiation rather
than magnetic ﬁelds is more important in prevent fragmentation
close to growing stars. Magnetic ﬁelds are important in preventing
the creation of new stars in low-density regions that are far from
heating sources, but, once a region becomes unstable, they play lit-
tle role in regulating the subsequent collapse and fragmentation.

Finally, we see that the thermal pressure including the effects
of radiation feedback is the most effective mechanism for hold-
ing up the gas. It stabilises a gas mass in excess of the central star
mass for all central stars smaller than ∼ 0.1 M(cid:12); the dispersion in
mBE,crit is surprisingly small. The typical ∼ 0.01 M(cid:12) star that has
just formed due to a second collapse is immediately surrounded by
an island of gas that is too hot to fragment, and which is ∼ 5 times
the mass of the star itself. As the star grows by accreting this gas,
its luminosity rises and the heated island expands, remaining larger
than the star until the star reaches ∼ 0.1 M(cid:12).

4 DISCUSSION

4.1 Towards a Comprehensive Picture of the Origins of the

IMF

The analysis we have performed is best understood within the con-
text of a physical model for the origin of the IMF. Gas in star-
forming clouds is able to cool on timescales much shorter than its
dynamical time, and this makes it highly subject to fragmentation
during collapse. Since the Jeans mass is a decreasing function of
density as long as gas remains isothermal or close to it, this frag-
mentation proceeds to ever-smaller mass scales. If this process con-
tinued unimpeded, the resulting mass function would peak near the
opacity limit for fragmentation, ∼ 0.004 M(cid:12) (Low & Lynden-Bell
1976; Rees 1976; Whitworth et al. 2007). The actual peak of the
IMF, which is ∼ 2 orders of magnitude larger than this, is deter-
mined by whatever arrests this cascade of fragmentation. Put more
succinctly, it is helpful to rephrase the question “what sets the peak

c(cid:13) 2015 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–10

of the IMF?” as the question “what suppresses the formation of
brown dwarfs?”

Since the equations of isothermal self-gravitating magnetohy-
drodynamics do not by themselves impose a mass scale (McKee,
Li & Klein 2010; Krumholz 2014), suppression of the formation
of low mass objects must come from either the initial conditions
or from a deviation from isothermality. An example of the former
approach is the model of Padoan & Nordlund (2004), who posit
that brown dwarfs are rare because only in the most unusual, high-
pressure regions is it possible for a region of gas in the brown dwarf
mass range to become gravitationally bound. Since the require-
ments for becoming bound are ultimately set by the strength of the
turbulence, as parameterised by the normalisation of the linewidth-
size relation, in this class of models the frequency of brown dwarfs
should depend on this normalisation. This is potentially problem-
atic, since one then predicts a signiﬁcant overabundance of brown
dwarfs relative to stars in regions with stronger turbulence at ﬁxed
size scale, as is typically found in massive star-forming clumps

Krumholz et al.

(Shirley et al. 2003). At present there is no evidence for such vari-
ation in the brown dwarf to star ratio, but further observations are
needed to rule it out.

Our ﬁndings suggest an alternate explanation for the paucity
of brown dwarfs relative to stars. We ﬁnd that fragmentation in the
immediate vicinity of young stars is suppressed primarily by ther-
mal radiation feedback from the star itself. As noted above, stars
with masses below the peak of the IMF, ∼ 0.1 M(cid:12) or less, are
invariably surrounded by a mass of gas less than a thermal Jeans
mass that is in excess of the mass of the central star. This would not
be true in the absence of stellar radiation. In simulations including
a strong initial magnetic ﬁeld, magnetic support is comparable to
thermal support in importance for objects up to ∼ 0.05 M(cid:12), but is
substantially less important by the time the central object reaches
∼ 0.1 M(cid:12), suggesting that thermal support is ultimately the more
important process.

Moreover, it is highly suggestive that the mass that can be sup-
ported against collapse by thermal pressure plays an important role
in determining the location of the IMF peak, by making it difﬁcult
for low mass stars to form. To illustrate this, in Figure 6 we show
the ratio (mBE,crit +m∗)/m∗, i.e., this is the fraction by which the
mass of the star would be increased by accretion of all the material
around itself that is too warm to fragment. This is (cid:38) 5 at the lowest
masses, which naturally explains why brown dwarfs are compara-
tively rare: a “prospective” dwarf of mass ∼ 0.01 M(cid:12) is usually
luminous enough to have heated ∼ 0.05 M(cid:12) of material around it-
self to a point where it is too hot to collapse, and instead seems very
likely to be accreted. By the time the object has accreted this gas
and grown to ∼ 0.05 M(cid:12), it has heated up another ∼ 0.05 M(cid:12) of
material to the point where it cannot fragment, enabling it to grow
to ∼ 0.1 M(cid:12), and so forth. This process continues but comes ever
less important as stars gain in mass. By the time stars approach the
peak of the IMF, ∼ 0.2 − 0.3 M(cid:12), the amount of heated mass
around them has fallen to tens of percent of their current mass, and
represents a relatively minor perturbation if and when it is accreted.
This explains why we should expect the peak of the IMF to fall at
∼ 0.2 − 0.3 M(cid:12). Only in rare circumstances does this heating
mechanism allow an object to remain at ∼ 0.01 M(cid:12), rather than
continuing to grow. It is worth noting here the analogy between this
explanation for the rarity of brown dwarfs and the analysis of gi-
ant planet formation by disc instability by Kratter, Murray-Clay &
Youdin (2010), who show that disc instability can happen, but that
the objects it creates usually wind up as binary companions rather
than ceasing accretion at planetary masses.

4.2 Caveats and Cautions

We end this discussion by cautioning that the simulations on which
we base our conclusions use initial conditions chosen to be appro-
priate for star formation in the Milky Way. It is an open question
whether the same results would hold for radically different condi-
tions, for example those found in a low-metallicity dwarf galaxy or
in a starburst or high redshift galaxy where the gas is much denser
and more turbulence than is typical of the Milky Way. Radiation-
hydrodynamic simulations of gas fragmentation and star formation
at varying metallicity suggest that our results should robust against
metallicity variations at least over several dex in metal abundance
(Myers et al. 2011; Bate 2014), but fully answering that question
will require repeating the analysis presented here at a range of
metallicities.

On the question of how gas density and turbulence might af-
fect the results, there are no simulations in the literature that of-

fer much guidance, only analytic and semi-analytic models. The
density of the gas will affect the typical accretion rate onto stars,
which in turn will change their luminosities, enabling them to heat
more material. On the other hand, increasing density makes it easier
for gas to fragment by lowering the Bonnor-Ebert mass. Krumholz
(2011) and Guszejnov, Krumholz & Hopkins (2016) ﬁnd that these
two effects nearly cancel, yielding a characteristic mass that is
close to independent of density. However, this proposition remains
untested by simulations.

5 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

We have investigated the structure of the gas in collapsing regions
formed in simulations of the formation of star clusters. Because
the simulations include a very wide range of physics – turbulence,
magnetohydrodynamics, gravity, radiative transfer (including radi-
ation from young stars), and protostellar outﬂows – we are able to
isolate the collapsing regions and compare the inﬂuence of various
processes in determining where gas does and does not fragment,
and thus in setting the peak of the IMF.

We ﬁnd that collapsing cores approach a proﬁle of density ver-
sus distance from the central object that is constant in time, with
no dependence on the initial magnetic ﬁeld strength in the simu-
lations. The same is true of the magnetic ﬂux, strongly suggesting
that the magnetic ﬂux in the vicinity of a collapsing core is deter-
mined more by local processes than by the ﬂux present on larger
scales. The temperature of the gas, on the other hand, strongly
varies with central star mass, rising with time as stars grow and
accrete more rapidly. The relatively small amount of magnetic ﬂux
around young stars, coupled with the rising temperatures, means
that the gas in the immediate vicinity of young stars is primarily
prevented from collapsing on its own (as opposed to accreting onto
the already-collapsed object) by thermal pressure.

This support is non-negligible for protostellar objects in the
brown dwarf mass range. The amount of mass around the object
that is too warm to be able to fragment is several times the mass
of the object itself, and this gas will likely be accreted unless some
external even intervenes. This will push the object into the stel-
lar mass range, a phenomenon that explains why brown dwarfs are
rare compared to stars. This effect ceases to be signiﬁcant once
stars reach ∼ 0.2 M(cid:12), because stars at this mass can only suppress
fragmentation in a mass that is only a few tens of percent of their
own, not enough to make the star grow signiﬁcantly. This ﬁnding
strongly suggests that radiation feedback is the key process in de-
termining the location of the peak of the IMF. Radiative heating
suppresses formation of stars below the peak, and then stops oper-
ating, leaving the majority of stars with masses ∼ 0.2− 0.3 M(cid:12) as
we observe.

As discussed in Section 2.2, the mass-weighted mean sound speed
and other quantities that enter calculation of the critical masses
can be computed cumulatively, meaning taking the mass-weighted
mean of all material inside a given radial shell, or differentially,
meaning computed using only the material between two adjacent
shells. The cumulative choice seems more physically reasonable
for the purposes of computing the mass supported against collapse,
since the calculation of the mass enclosed within a given radius
is necessarily cumulative. Nonetheless, for completeness we have
repeated all of the analysis included in the main text using the dif-
ferential deﬁnition. Figure A1 shows the effective temperature in
the strong magnetic ﬁeld run using the differential deﬁnition, and
Figure A2 shows the critical masses; note that for the differential
case, we use a coefﬁcient of 1.18 rather than 1.86 in equation 1.
The other runs show similar results, and are omitted for reasons of
space.

As the plots show, the differential effective temperature is, not
surprisingly lower. The differential density (not shown) is some-
what higher, due to omission of the central evacuated region. The
net result is that both the heated and non-heated critical masses are

(blue) and by thermal pressure at a ﬁxed temperature of 10 K (cid:104)mBE,10,crit(cid:105)
(green), versus central star mass m∗. We show quantities computed both
cumulatively (i.e., using all the mass inside a given radius – solid line) and
differentially (i.e., just using the mass in a thin shell at a given radius –
dashed line). The values shown are for the strong magnetic ﬁeld run. Shaded
regions show the 1σ scatter in the means. We omit plots of (cid:104)mφ(cid:105) to avoid
cluttering the plot.

somewhat reduced compared to the cumulative deﬁnition. How-
ever, the result that the critical mass with heating is higher than that
without heating and than the magnetically-supported mass, and that
it exceeds the mass of the central object in the brown dwarf mass
regime, continues to hold.
