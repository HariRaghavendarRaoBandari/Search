Next-Nearest Neighbour Interactions in the One, Two, and Three Dimensional

Holstein Model

(Dated March 17, 2016)

Allowing a single electron to hop to next-nearest neighbours (NNN) in addition to closest atomic sites in
the Holstein model, a modiﬁed Trugman method is applied to exactly calculate the eﬀect on the polaronic
eﬀective mass in one, two, and three dimensions, building on the previous study of the one-dimensional NNN
Holstein model. We also present perturbative calculations and a heuristic scaling factor for the coupling
strength and ion frequency to nearly map the NNN Holstein model back onto the original Holstein model.

I.

INTRODUCTION

In the realm of BCS theory,

it is well known that
electron-phonon interactions in solid materials are in-
tegral to the emergence of superconductivity, as they
are responsible for the formation of Cooper pairs [1].
On the other hand, the importance of electron-phonon
interactions in high temperature superconductivity is not
yet clear [2]. Since polarons are simply quasiparticles
consisting of electrons dressed with the net eﬀect of
these electron-phonon interactions,
it is important to
understand this basic building block to fully understand
conventional superconductivity. To this end, the problem
of a single electron in the conduction band of a crystal
lattice has been extensively studied [3]. Speciﬁcally, an
eﬀective algorithm for studying the properties of the
Holstein model with tight-binding electron bands was
formulated in Ref. 4, and now that problem is eﬀectively
solved. Several extensions were subsequently reported,
including ones to better manage disparate electron (t)
and phonon (ωE) energy scales (in particular, ωE << t)
[5, 6], higher dimensionality [7–9], extended interaction
range [10, 11] and inclusion of next-nearest neighbour
(NNN) single-particle hopping amplitude [12].
In this
study it was found that including NNN hopping in the
one dimensional Holstein model altered signiﬁcantly the
electron’s eﬀective mass.

The purpose of this paper is to follow up on this
study. Thus far studies of polaron properties within
the Holstein model have revealed that the eﬀective mass
becomes very large with rather modest electron-phonon
coupling strength. Chakraborty et al.
[12] found that
including NNN hopping in the one-dimensional Holstein
model altered signiﬁcantly the electron’s eﬀective mass.
This is potentially very important since this is a means
for lowering the polaron eﬀective mass to a realistic level,
such that an Eliashberg treatment [13–17] makes sense.

To more fully understand the eﬀects due to NNN

electron hopping we will ﬁrst present our perturbation
theory calculations for the energy and eﬀective mass of
the NNN Holstein in one, two, and three dimensions.
These results naturally match up with our exact numer-
ical calculations using our previously reﬁned algorithm
for the Holstein model [11] extended to include NNN
interactions. We note that quantitative agreement with
perturbation theory extends over a surprisingly limited
range of electron-phonon interaction strength, even in
three dimensions, which is the most applicable to bulk
superconductors. A low phonon frequency approximation
to the perturbation theory results suggests a scaling
of the phonon frequency with the low energy eﬀective
bandwidth, which explains the results obtained as a
function of NNN electron hopping. We also note an
additional scaling factor that accounts for the results
with non-zero NNN hopping with respect to those with
nearest-neighbour hopping only, over a more extended
coupling strength range.

II. MODEL & METHODS

A. Holstein Model

The Holstein model [18] is perhaps the simplest model
for describing electron-phonon interactions; it treats (op-
tical) phonons as local ion vibrations, and assumes that
each atomic site oscillates with the same characteristic
frequency ωE. With NNN hopping included, the Hamil-
tonian is:

where (cid:126)Rj points to lattice site j, and (cid:126)k is a wave vector
summed over the First Brillouin Zone (FBZ). The relation
†
for ˆc

tian conjugate of the above expression, and the bosonic
Fourier transforms are deﬁned almost identically. In the
FBZ there are N distinct k values within (−π, π) (the
lattice spacing a has been set to unity). Our Hamiltonian
is thus equal to:

In this paper, we will examine various properties of the
ground state, which for t(cid:48)

energy dispersion quadratic in p = |p|, so that the ground

B. Weak-coupling Perturbation Theory

Beginning with the perturbative approach (in the weak
coupling regime), we consider the electron-phonon inter-
action to be the perturbation, so that the unperturbed
energy is simply E(0)
p = p. The unperturbed ground
state for arbitrary p is therefore

|φ(0)
p (cid:105) = ˆc†

p |0(cid:105) .

(5)
Here, |0(cid:105) is simply the electron-phonon vacuum state.
Unperturbed excited states include all states with a single
electron and any number of phonons such that the total

crystal momentum still adds to p.
that given these deﬁnitions, E(1)
p = 0, independent of
the choice of total crystal momentum. Under these
conditions, the energy correction to second order (in α
or g) is:

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:104)φ(0)

(cid:88)

k,q

E(2)

†
p | ˆVpertˆc
kˆa†
p − (k + ¯hωE)

q |0(cid:105)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)2

(6)

In this case, ˆVpert is the electron-phonon interaction term
of the Hamiltonian in Eq. 3. Note that only one phonon
is considered in the unperturbed excited states because
ˆVpert only creates (annihilates) one phonon. Upon evalu-
ating this sum, we may apply Eq. 4 to ﬁnd the eﬀective
mass. In order to do so, we convert the sum in Eq. 6 to
an integral over k-values, since the thermodynamic limit
(N → ∞) implies a continuum of k values between −π
and π.

In the one-dimensional case, the corrected energy ac-

cording to second order perturbation theory (in g) is

More generally, evaluating for the second-order energy
correction in two or three dimensions proves tedious,
and has a cumbersome, unenlightening answer (as in
eq. (8)). For these cases, we have also integrated the
result numerically to check our analytical results.

For an approximate analytical result, we observe that
the integrand in the energy correction expression decays
more or less to 0 by some k0 < π for most small values
of the parameters β and ωE. Cutting the integral oﬀ at
this k0 and making the approximation that k (cid:28) 1 for
k ≤ k0, we achieve the analytic approximations shown
in Table II. Unfortunately, these approximations prove
to be rather crude in 2D and 3D, which limits their
usefulness. Regardless, we present them alongside our
numerically integrated results for completeness in Figs. (1
- 3). The approximations do work better for smaller ωE;
however we have tested then in a reasonably physically
representative regime of small ωE [11] and even here the
agreement is poor.

Secondly,

it is important to note that the range of
coupling strengths over which the numerical perturbation

1 This deﬁnition is preferred by the authors since it captures better
the density of states for a single electron in the band, and only
diﬀers by an integral multiple of π/2 anyway.

imate perturbation theory, and exact numerical solution in
1D. Note that the approximate perturbation theory is on top
of the numerically integrated perturbation theory so here the
approximation in Table II works very well. We used parameter
values of ωE/t = 0.1 and t2/t = 0.025.

theory is valid is very small. This feature is similar to
our results for the standard Holstein model [11] so we do
not recommend using the perturbation calculations for
physical predictions but only as a check on more powerful
numerical calculations such as the Trugman Method.

C. Modiﬁed Trugman Method for Exact Numerical

Solutions

The single polaron problem is solved here with the
variational exact diagonalization method described in
Bon˘ca et al. [4] and revised by the authors as described
in [5, 11] to account for a rapidly growing Hilbert space

FIG. 2. Numerically integrated perturbation theory, approx-
imate perturbation theory, and exact numerical solution in
2D. Here the approximate perturbation calculation fails quite
badly even in the very small perturbative regime from g2 = 0
to g2 = 1. We used parameter values of ωE/t = 0.2 and
t2/t = 0.025.

FIG. 3. Numerically integrated perturbation theory, approxi-
mate perturbation theory, and exact numerical solution in 3D.

the very small perturbative regime from g2 = 0 to g2 = 3. We

from the additional terms in the Hamiltonian.
For
the data included in these plots 20 - 100 preliminary
diagonalizations were performed with the most strongly
contributing basis states selected at each iteration to
seed the next iteration. All results were converged for
the eﬀective mass. While our algorithm is substantially
diﬀerent in it’s generation of the basis space compared
to that of Chakraborty et al.
[12] our 1D results are in
agreement with theirs and our algorithm permits eﬃcient
calculations in higher dimensions and at realistic ωE
values.

While the introduction of non-zero t2 leaves the band-
width invariant,
it does alter the dispersion relation’s
curvature near k = 0. The result is a diﬀerent bare
electron mass (see Eq. (9)) and, correspondingly, a diﬀer-
ent eﬀective bandwidth. The diﬀerent bare electron mass
and diﬀerent normalization of the eﬀective mass has been
noted before [12], but the diﬀerent eﬀective bandwidth

and calculate the bandwidth in the region [−k0, k0] up
to second order accuracy in k0, then we ﬁnd the ratio of
next-nearest neighbour bandwidth to nearest neighbour
bandwidth to be:

This suggests the the ionic energy scale ωE also be
rescaled by the same factors to keep the ratio of ion fre-
quency to eﬀective bandwidth constant. The interaction
strength parameter g is dimensionless and thus remains
unchanged, though the electron-phonon interaction term
in the Hamiltonian is rescaled since it is proportional to
gωE.
It can be seen from the result in table II that
rescaling ωE by the eﬀective bandwidth change would
transform the NNN approximate eﬀective mass onto that
for NN hopping only.
if we use a
renormalized phonon frequency with the same value with
respect to the eﬀective electronic bandwidth, then the
addition of next nearest neighbour hopping has no eﬀect
on the eﬀective mass (according to Table II). However
these are only approximate perturbation calculations and
the exact results show that the NNN eﬀective mass is
substantially diﬀerent from the NN eﬀective mass even
when the proper scalings have been taken into account.
On the other hand, this rescaling of ωE (which was not
[12]), deﬁnitely reduces the
done by Chakraborty et al.
eﬀect of the NNN hopping on the polaron eﬀective mass.

In other words,

5

FIG. 4.
Note that the eﬀect of NNN hopping when the phonon
frequency is scaled is smaller that that reported previously by
Chakraborty et al. for identical values of NNN hopping. The
scaling we have used also changes the direction of the scaling,
as positive t2 now raises the eﬀective mass and negative t2
lowers it. We use a relatively small value of ωE/t = 0.1 since
phonon energies near the adiabatic regime are representative
of real phonons in real materials.

In Fig. 4 we compare the data with and without the
scaling of ωE to the original Holstein model in 1D with
t2/t = ±0.025 and t2/t = ±0.1. The 1D case has
no crossover coupling strength in the standard Holstein
model, and while t2 > 0 did decrease the eﬀective mass
somewhat, no crossover point was found for the NNN
Holstein model in 1D either. Our results are in agreement
with Chakraborty et al.
[12] for the same value (i.e.
unscaled) of ωE. However, including the correction de-
scribed in the preceding paragraph decreases the eﬀective
mass change and even the direction of the change. The 1D
case is not very realistic for bulk materials so we continue
with 2D and 3D calculations.

In two and three dimensions we ﬁnd that for small
NNN hopping parameters the eﬀective mass deviates
from the standard Holstein model only slightly until the
crossover coupling strength in 2D and 3D is reached.
At this point the eﬀective masses increases sharply for
both models. However, the introduction of non-zero t2
changes the crossover point slightly. We have included
the unscaled results with the ωE/t scaled results for the
sake of completeness in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 for 2D and 3D,
respectively.

While our approximate perturbation theory suggests

FIG. 5. Exact numerical results in 2D for t2/t = 0,±0.025.
Note that the scaling of ωE maps the NNN calculations back
to the original. This is in agreement with our approximate
perturbation theory results, though perhaps serendipitously
since the approximate perturbation theory was not very close
to the exact numerical perturbation theory.

that the scalings of ωE/t given in Table II would map
the NNN eﬀective masses onto the NN eﬀective mass,
Figs. 4, 5, and 6 make it clear that this scaling does not
work very well except in the 2D case. The approximate
perturbation theory only agrees exactly with the numer-
ical perturbation theory in 1D and there is no reason
to trust even the numerical perturbation theory for the
eﬀective mass outside of very small coupling strength as
we have remarked on other occasions [11].
In 2D the
approximate ωE scaling suggested in Table II mapped
the eﬀective masses back close to that obtained with no
NNN hopping, but in 1D and 3D it over-corrected the
change in the eﬀective mass. Also, not surprisingly, in
all three dimensions a simple scaling does not work well
in the very strong coupling regime. So in agreement
with Chakraborty et al.
[12], it does appear that NNN
hopping does introduce changes in the properties of the
polaron, and leads to a decreased eﬀective mass for some
additional (positive) t2 hopping if no phonon frequency
scaling is introduced. But NNN hopping does lead to
an increased eﬀective mass if the the phonon frequency
is also increased to account for the increase in the
‘local’ bandwidth. Most importantly for the conventional
framework for superconductivity, the inclusion of NNN
hopping does change the coupling strength in 3D at which
the eﬀective mass increases sharply towards inﬁnity (see
the large coupling regime of Fig. 6).

6

FIG. 6. Exact numerical results in 3D for t2/t = 0,±0.025.
Note the change in the crossover coupling strength. Here it
seems that the rescaling of ωE enhances the eﬀect of the NNN
hopping on the eﬀective mass beyond the crossover point,
albeit reversed in sign as was the case in 1D.

FIG. 7.
Exact numerical results in 1D, with g scaling for
t2/t = 0,±0.1. Note that the scale is much larger than that
of Fig. (4) and the scaling works very well over the previous
range, and improves the agreement with the numerical results
at stronger couplings.

D. Heuristic Scaling

In the course of our investigations we further found a
heuristic scaling of the coupling strength that, combined
with the bandwidth-inspired scaling, works very well;
however, the underlying physical motivation is still rather
unclear. We introduce a scaling factor in the dimension-
less interaction parameter goriginal · B = gscaled such that
the new term in the Hamiltonian is:

By experimenting with diﬀerent values of B we found
that in 1D, B = 1 + 4β and in 3D, B = 1 + β work
very well. These statements are validated in Figs. (7 , 8)
and at least for 3D is very accurate, even in the crossover
regime.

III. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

FIG. 8. Exact numerical results in 3D , with g scaling for
t2/t = 0, 0.025, and 0.1. The scaling works remarkably well
over the entire range, and matches up the crossover points
very well.

We have performed weak coupling perturbation calcu-
lations for the Holstein model with next nearest neigh-
bour (NNN) hopping and compared them with exact
calculations in one, two, and three dimensions. We
conﬁrmed previous results obtained in one dimension by
Chakraborty et al.
[12]; however, we point out that a
more appropriate comparison, at least in weak coupling,

requires a change of the phonon frequency, ωE, as given
in Table II, for the case with NNN hopping. With this
change accounted for we ﬁnd that the eﬀect of NNN
hopping on the eﬀective mass is opposite to the change
without a phonon frequency change. Including t2 with the
same sign as t reduces the polaron eﬀective mass, when
the same phonon frequency is used, whereas including a

7

change in the phonon frequency according to the changes
in eﬀective bandwidth as in Eqs. (10) and (11) increases
the eﬀective mass in 1D and 3D. In two dimensions NNN
hopping has very little eﬀect on the eﬀective mass in weak
coupling.

t2/t the crossover remains in the regime of moderate
electron-phonon coupling. Therefore it remains diﬃcult
to reconcile the fairly strong coupling attributed to some
real metals/superconductors with the diverging eﬀective
mass predicted for a single polaron at the same coupling
strength.

In 1D and 3D we have also found a heuristic scaling
factor for g, the dimensionless electron-phonon coupling
strength, that maps the results for the polaron eﬀective
mass of the NNN Holstein model back onto the stan-
dard model, without NNN hopping. While the physical
reason for this eﬀect is not known, this heuristic scaling
allows us to crudely estimate how increasing t2 impacts
the coupling strength at which the (sharp) crossover
occurs for polaronic behaviour. For small values of
