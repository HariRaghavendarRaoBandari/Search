The Value of A Statistical Life

in Absence of Panel Data: What can we do?

Abstract

In this paper I show how reliable estimates of the Value of a Sta-
tistical Life (VSL) can be obtained using cross sectional data using
Garen’s instrumental variable (IV) approach. The increase in the
range conﬁdence intervals due to the IV setup can be reduced by a
factor of 3 by using a proxy to risk attitude. In order state the “pre-
cision” of the cross sectional VSL estimates I estimate the VSL using
Chilean panel data and use them as benchmark for diﬀerent cross sec-
tional speciﬁcations. The use of the proxy eliminates need for using
hard-to-ﬁnd instruments for the job risk level and narrows the con-
ﬁdence intervals for the workers in the Chilean labor market for the
year 2009.

1

Introduction

In the last years the Value of a Statistical Life (VSL) has won an important

place as a tool for public policy decision and welfare measure (Jena et al,

2003)[8]. As consequence, there is an increasing concern on the reliability of

the VSL estimates due to the disparate results and the sometimes excessively

large conﬁdence intervals found in the literature. Several methods have been

proposed to get reasonable and stable estimates, and the most successful

ones involve the use of panel data sets (Knieser et al, 2012)[10]. This arises

one important concern: can we still say anything about the VSL in absence

of panel data? This concern becomes particularly important in developing

economies, where there are neither VSL estimates or available panel data

sets.

By using data from the Chilean labor market I show how the VSL can be

accurately estimated from cross sectional data at a cost of a wide conﬁdence

interval by using Garen’s (1988)[5] instrumental variable (IV) approach. I

also show that the range of this conﬁdence interval can be reduced by a factor

of 3 by using a proxy to risk attitude. In order state the “precision” of the

cross sectional VSL estimates I use panel data estimates as benchmark.

The innovation respect to the previous literature is the use of a variable

that measures directly the willingness to take risks, which avoids the need

for the use of instruments and at the same time reduces the variance of the

estimates.

2 Literature Review

In addition to the traditional econometric problems in the estimation of wage

equations (such as selection bias and omitted variables), the estimation of the

Value of a Statistical Life using the hedonic wages approach adds the issue

of the measurement error in the risk levels (fatal and non-fatal). Authors

have tried to account for this issue, especially when it is correlated with the

covariates in the wage equations (Black and Kniesner, 2003)[3], when the

safety risks levels are diﬃcult to quantify (Ashenfelter, 2006)[2] or when the

non fatal measure is not as accurate as the fatal measurement (Siebert and

Wei, 1994)[13].

Even if we have a good measurement of the risk level, usually they are

presented in an aggregate fashion, most of the time grouped by economic

industry group. If the aggregation is done in j sectors, then the risk mea-

surement variable will take only j possible values. This implies that we will

end up with zero heterogeneity between groups and that the estimates will

have low explanatory power. Additional to this, we expect that in most of

the cases the individuals will supply their work hours according to the per-

ceived risk and not the actual risk level, which may be unknown. Viscusi

(1979)[16] proposes that perceived risk is correlated with the eﬀective risk

rates, but usually researchers cannot test that hypothesis because very de-

tailed data is necessary in order to have reliable estimators. Timmins and

Murdock (2007)[15] propose a method to alleviate such need for detail using

data from other ﬁrms in the same economic sector as instruments for risk

level perception. In this case, the risk level measure will be a good covari-

ate for estimating the labor demand function but not for the labor supply

2

function.

Another concern when the wage-risk trade-oﬀ is estimated is the self-

selection problem. It arises in two ways: First, workers with low risk aver-

sion will choose risky jobs not necessarily because of the higher wage, but

for the utility they obtain from risk, which implies that wages and risk lev-

els are simultaneously determined (Garen, 1988)[5]. Second, the omission

of unobserved productivity lowers the VSL estimates. According to Hwang

et al.

(1992)[6], the addition of productivity proxies to the estimation of

wage equations tends to increase the estimators of the VSL up to ten times,

whereas Garen (1988)[5] suggested that “coolheadness” should explain dif-

ferences in productivity: a cool-headed worker may be more productive that

the average worker in a risky job, but non diﬀerent than the average worker

in a safe work.

The best solution the self selection problem is the use of panel data to

diﬀerence out any unobservable ability correlated with occupation selection

and risk preferences (Knieser et all, 2012)[10]. Unfortunately panel data is

not allways available. A feasible solution using cross sectional data is the use

of an appropriate instrumental variable (Reiersol, 1941)[14], however there

is wide consensus in the diﬃculty to ﬁnd one. Also, uncomfortably wide

conﬁdence intervals are obtained using weak instruments (Kochi, 2007)[9].

The most of the studies have concentrated in to obtain VSL estimates for

developed countries. Since there are diﬀerences in the VSL estimates among

developed and underdeveloped countries and am using data from one of the

last, I will provide a brief discussion of the diﬀerences in the section 3.

3

3 VSL Variations Between Countries

Among the few studies with results for developed countries, Miller (2000)[11]

is perhaps the most comprehensive. Miller analyzes 68 studies and extrapo-

late the results to 49 countries using the Gross Domestic Product as predictor.

Even though the indirectly obtained values cannot be directly compared with

those estimated using hedonic wages, they provide some insights about how

the relative magnitudes of the estimates should be among countries.

As one can expect, the estimates for developed countries are higher than

the estimates for developing and underdeveloped ones and some explanations

can be provided. First, the labor markets in underdeveloped countries are not

properly developed, and then the market wages do not incorporate properly

the risk levels, yielding small risk premiums. Second, safety standards are less

restrictive in those countries, allowing the employers to provide low quality

safety equipment and facilities. This problem is worse in the absence of a

job contract, in which case the employer is not responsible for providing any

safety measures and workers must accept a lower wage to face a reduction in

the work risk. Finally, the results for underdeveloped countries usually are

expressed in U.S. dollars, but not corrected by parity of purchasing power.

Whichever the cause, the diﬀerence is notorious if we compare the results

reported by Miller (2000)[11] for North America and European Union of

2.3 to 5 million dollars of 2009 with the estimates for Chile that ranges

form 0.8 to 1.3 million dollars. However, since Miller’s results are based in

extrapolations of VSL from developed countries based on GDP, the results

are not comparable and the estimates for underdeveloped countries are lower

just because they have lower GDP per capita. The only VSL result obtained

4

from labor market data for estimate for Chile is about 4.6 million dollars

(Parada et al, 2012)[12].

4 Econometric Framework

For the panel estimates I used the following hedonic log-wage equation:

ln wijt = αi + α1πjt + Xitβ + uijt

,

(1)

where ln wijt is the log of the monthly wage of worker i (i = 1, . . . , N), in the

industry j (j = 1, . . . , J), at time t (t = 1, . . . , T ), αi is an individual constant

term, πjt is the industry speciﬁc risk rate, Xit are demographics controls:

education, age, age squared, monthly hours worked and dummies for public

sector, union status and contract status. uijt is a normally distributed iid

error term. I tried diﬀerent speciﬁcations using time controls also, but they

were not signiﬁcant.

The cross sectional estimates are the one-period version of the log-wage

equation. From equation (1) we estimate the VSL by using the formula

[V SL = (cid:20)(cid:18) ∂ ˆw

∂π

= ˆα1 × w(cid:19) × h × 10, 000(cid:21) ,

(2)

were h are the annual hours of work, w is the average wage (Note that the

fatal risk is per 10,000 worker.)

5 Data

I have used two sources of information: the Chilean Safety Association Yearly

Reports, which are the only public statistics about workplace fatal and non

5

fatal accidents, and the Chilean Social Protection Survey, waves 2004, 2006

and 2009, which is a rich data set of approximately 20,000 Chilean people

in the labor market. It contains information about labor history, retirement

funds, education, health, training, assets and household composition. The

survey is modular:

individual, labor history and household information is

presented in separated hierarchical data ﬁles. In order to have comparable

estimates I used male and female over 19 years old that worked for salary

pay in the year of the survey, non permanently disabled and without missing

values on the covariates1.

The description of the workplace fatal risks by industry group and year

are presented in table 1. As shown in the table, the aggregation of the

information is by one digit SIC, so the variable risk is constant over groups.

The descriptive statistics of all the variables for the econometric exercise

are presented in table 2 for the wave of 2009.

The common variables for the Mincer’s speciﬁcation are presented along

with a dummy for the existence of job contract. This is an important variable

usually not presented in studies for developed countries, but that makes a big

diﬀerence in underdeveloped ones as explained in section 3. The instruments

for risk are marital status, spouse years of schooling, dummies for spouse

illness and job and the number of children under 6 years old. The variable

willingness to take risks is the used proxy for risk preferences and consists of a

likert-type variable ranging from 0 to 10, 0 being the lesser willingness to take

risks. Under the assumption that risk preferences do aﬀect job choice and

1Perhaps for comparison with the bulk of results for developed economies it would
be better to estimate only for male workers, but the fatality risk variable includes both
genders, so separation is inappropriate. Also, the unique VSL for Chile includes both male
and female, so I did not restrict the sample.

6

wages, the inclusion this variable will capture the individual heterogeneity

eliminating the need for an instrument.

6 Results

The benchmark estimates for the equation 2 are presented in table 3. As ex-

pected, I get diﬀerent results from the diﬀerent panel speciﬁcations, ranging

between 1.4 and 7.4 million dollars. The pooled OLS and the ﬁxed estima-

tors are in general expected to be either downwards or upward bias due to

unobservable heterogeneity. If the unobserved variables that capture hetero-

geneity are time invariant, then the within estimator or the ﬁrst diﬀerence

estimator should be the most appropriated. The point estimators for this

two models are similar, but the ﬁrst diﬀerences estimator is not signiﬁcant.

This is not surprising in presence of small unbalanced panel. The minimum

requirement for identiﬁcation of a balanced model is two sample periods and

in this case there are just three. As pointed by Jimenez-Martin (1988)[7],

unbalanced panel exhibit worse testing performance than balanced one for

a ﬁxed number of individuals. If the unobserved variables are not time in-

variant, then the random eﬀects will be more appropriated. Note that both

random eﬀects estimators are signiﬁcant and lies between the lowest and

highest estimates, so am using them as benchmark. Although the random

eﬀects model assumes that unobserved heterogeneity is uncorrelated with

the covariates in the model, which may not be true, it still reduce the VSL

compared with those who are not controlling for it (Knieser et al, 2012)[10].

Assuming that the “right” estimate for the VSL is around 3.4 and 3.9

7

million dollars, the next step is to investigate if similar results can be obtained

from cross sectional data.

There results of the estimation of the cross sectional version of the equa-

tion 2 are presented in the table 4.

In the ﬁrst column I show the base

estimates for the log-wage equation using the simple linear approach. The

right hand side variables are a constant, years of schooling, age, age squared,

worked hours, three dummies for public sector workers, contract and union

membership and the fatal risk. The estimated VSL is us$715,036 with a

range of the 95% conﬁdence interval of us$133,159. This estimate is ex-

pected to biased because is not correcting for unobserved heterogeneity and

it is outside the conﬁdence intervals of the benchmark estimates. The eﬀect

of the bias is undetermined and depends on how the unobserved variables

are correlated with the wage and fatality rates.

The result of the use of the IV estimation using Garen’s (1988) approach

is presented in the column (2). This speciﬁcation has the same covariates

as those in column (1), but the risk is instrumented using marital status,

number children under 6 years old, schooling of the spouse and dummies for

illness of the spouse and work of the spouse. As expected, the estimate VSL

increased to us$3,654,338, but at a cost of an increase in the range of the 95%

conﬁdence interval, which is now us$819,741. In spite of the increase in the

conﬁdence interval, this estimate is more apropriate than that obtained in the

ﬁrst setup because it is controlling for risk preferences and it is statistically

not diﬀerent from the benchmark estimates and has lower variance. This is

mild evidence in favor of the goodness of the instruments.

Overall, the instruments are good predictors of risk and satisfy the exclu-

8

sion condition under the Anderson-Rubin (1949)[1] test setup, but they do

not under the Fractionally Resampled Anderson-Rubin setup (Berkowitz et

al, 2012)[4], so one or some of them may be weak.

The ﬁnal speciﬁcation is presented in the column (3). This estimation

include the same covariates than in the column (1) and adds the proxy for

the risk preferences. The estimate for the fatal risk coeﬃcient is not statis-

tically diﬀerent from that obtained from the IV estimation, but its standard

error is smaller. This allow a good reduction in the width of the 95% conﬁ-

dence interval to us$265,153. This is only a third of the range estimated by

using the IV approach and is evidence supporting the distortion of the use

of inappropriate instruments (Kochi, 2007)[9].

To put this estimates in context, they are statistically lower than the

reported by Knieser et al. (2012)[10], which ranges the VSL for USA between

5 to 12 million dollars and also inferior to the ones reported by Parada et

al (2012)[12] for Chile, but since there is not an interval for the last ones,

equality cannot be either accepted or rejected.

7 Conclusion

In this paper I have shown that it is still possible to get reliable VSL estimates

from cross sectional data. This is crucial in developing economies, where

the available data is scarce or non-existent and the cost of a panel-type

surveying process is sometimes too high. In such cases, dimension reductions

are very welcome as ways to reduce surveying costs and increase the quality

of statistical inference by using better covariates. I also provided evidence

9

that the instruments proposed by Garen (1988)[5] may be weak and better

instrument are required to use this approach.

This results provides evidence that that the use of a variable that directly

measure the attitude toward risks can eliminate the need of the use of in-

struments to correct for risk and wage endogeneity and reduce the range of

the VSL conﬁdence intervals.

It is important to note that this approach is not eliminating the mea-

surement error in the job risk variable and it is not controlling for latent

heterogeneity in productivity, but still provides a good way to increase the

accuracy of the VSL estimates. One concern is that the proxy for risk may

not be capturing the attitude towards labor risk. The question How willing

are you to take risks? is too broad, and people can be thinking diﬀerent

risk sources when answering (like ﬁnancial risks or risky outdoors activities.)

This arises a measurement error problem for the proxy, and the parameters

may be biased toward zero, but since the point estimates under the IV and

under the linear setup are the same, there is no evidence that the bias is

important.
