ON RELATIVE CENTRAL EXTENSIONS AND

COVERING PAIRS

A. POURMIRZAEI∗, M. HASSANZADEH AND B. MASHAYEKHY

Abstract. Let (G, N ) be a pair of groups. In this article, ﬁrst we
construct a relative central extension for the pair (G, N ) such that
special types of covering pair of (G, N ) are homomorphic image of
it. Second, we show that every perfect pair admits at least one
covering pair. Finally, among extending some properties of perfect
groups to perfect pairs, we characterize covering pairs of a perfect
pair (G, N ) under some extra assumptions.

In this paper the well-known notion of relative central extension of
a pair of groups is used. By a pair of groups we mean a group G
and a normal subgroup N and this is denoted by (G, N). Let M be
another group on which an action of G is given. The G-commutator
subgroup of M is deﬁned by the subgroup [M, G] of M generated by
all the G-commutators

[m, g] = mgm−1,

in which g ∈ G, m ∈ M and mg is the action of g on m. Ellis [1]
deﬁned the G-center of M to be the subgroup

Z(M, G) = {m ∈ M|mg = m, ∀g ∈ G}

Now we recall the deﬁnition of relative central extension of a pair of
groups.

Deﬁnition 0.1. ([2]) Let (G, N) be a pair of groups. A relative cen-
tral extension of the pair (G, N) consists of a group homomorphism
σ : M → G, together with an action of G on M such that
(i)σ(M) = N;
(ii)σ(mg) = g−1σ(m)g, for all g ∈ G, m ∈ M;
(iii)m′σ(m) = m−1m′m, for all m, m′ ∈ M;
(iv)Ker(σ) ⊆ Z(M, G),

Note that for every relative central extension σ : M → G of a pair
of groups (G, N), we have Inn(M) ⊆ Imσ, by the property (iii) in
Deﬁnition 0.1. Moreover, every relative central extension σ : M → G
yields an exact sequence

1 → kerσ → M σ→ N → 1.

Conversely, for every exact sequence

1 → kerσ → M ′ σ→ N → 1

with properties (i)-(iv), ρ : M ′ → G is a relative central extension. For
this reason we do not diﬀer between a relative central extension and
its associated exact sequence.

Let σ : M → G, σ′ : M ′ → G be two relative central extensions
In 1998 Eliss [2] introduced a morphism between these
of (G, N).
relative central extensions which is a group homomorphism ϕ : M →
M ′ satisfying σ′ϕ(m) = σ(m) and ϕ(mg) = (ϕ(m))g for all g ∈ G,
In particular, if ϕ is a surjective homomorphism, then σ′
m ∈ M.
is called a homomorphic image of σ. The resulting category is the
category of relative central extensions which Eliss denoted it by RCE
(G, N).

Now we recall the deﬁnition of a covering pair.

Deﬁnition 0.2. ([2]) A relative central extension σ : M ∗ → G of the
pair (G, N) is called a covering pair for (G, N) if there exists a subgroup
A of M ∗ such that
(i)A ⊆ Z(M ∗, G) ∩ [M ∗, G];
(ii)A ∼= M(G, N);
(iii)N ∼= M ∗/A,
where M(G, N) is the Schur multiplier of the pair (G, N).

A covering pair σ : G∗ → G of the pair (G, G) coincides with the
usual notion of a covering group G∗ of the group G. In 1998 Ellis [2]
showed that every pair of ﬁnite groups admits at least one covering
pair.

In this paper we consider P as a perfect group that satisﬁes in max-
imal condition which means φ(P ) 6= P such that φ(P ) is the Frattini
subgroup of P . We mention that if σ : P → G is a covering pair of
(G, N), then we have P ′ = [P, G] and therefore

N = σ(P ) = σ([P, G]) = [σ(P ), G] = [N, G].

Let (G, N) be a pair of groups with free presentation G ∼= F/R and
N ∼= S/R for a normal subgroup S of F , where F is the free group
on the set G. In Section 1, we introduce a relative central extension
δ : S/[R, F ] → G which has an important role throughout the paper.
As a consequence, we show that for every covering pair σ : P → G, P is
a homomorphic image of S/[R, F ]. We remark that in 2007 Salemkar,
Moghaddam and Chiti [7, Lemma 2.5] claimed that there exists an
epimorphism from δ to any relative central extension without any con-
dition. We present a counterexample to show that their claim is not
correct and hence one of their main results [7, Theorem 2.6] is not valid.
In 1978 Loday [5] extended the notion of perfect group to perfect
pair in the sense that a pair of groups (G, N) is perfect if [G, N] = N.
Moreover he proved that (G, N) is a perfect pair of groups if and only
if RCE (G, N) has a universal object. To prove this he used some
cohomological methods. In Section 2, by restriction of δ to [S, F ]/[R, F ]
we obtain a universal object in RCE (G, N) when (G, N) is perfect.
This is also a covering pair of (G, N). It is worth to mention that we
use only presentation methods instead of cohomological methods which
seems easier.
In sequel we extend a result of Schur on covering groups to covering
pairs.

POURMIRZAEI, HASSANZADEH AND MASHAYEKHY

In the following theorem we present a relation between the above
relative central extension to anyone of the pair (G, N), especially to
any covering pair σ : M → G of (G, N).
Theorem 1.1. Let G ∼= F/R, where F is the free group on the set
G and N be a normal subgroup of G with N ∼= S/R for a normal
subgroup S of F . If σ : M → G is a relative central extension of the
pair (G, N), then there exists a homomorphism β : S/[R, F ] → M such
that the following diagram is commutative:

1 → R
[R,F ] → S
[R,F ]
β ↓
β| ↓

δ→ N → 1

k

1 → A → M σ→ N → 1,

where δ is the relative central extension (4). In particular, if M is a
perfect group with φ(M) 6= M, then the above homomorphism β is an
epimorphism.

Proof. Consider the map f : G → N by the rule f (g) = g if g ∈ N,
otherwise f (g) = 1. Now f induces a homomorphism θ : F → N.
Using the projective property of free groups, there is a homomorphism
α : F → M such that σα = θ. By the restriction of θ and α to S we
have the following commutative diagram:

S
α| ւ ↓ θ|

M σ−→ N −→ 1.

For x ∈ F and r ∈ R, α([r, x]) = [α(r), α(x)] = 1 since α(r) ∈ kerσ ≤
Z(M, G) ≤ Z(M). Therefore [R, F ] ≤ kerα| which implies the exis-
tence of

β :

→ M.

S

[R, F ]

Clearly β(R/[R, F ]) ≤ kerσ, which gives the restriction of β to R/[R, F ],
β|. Now let A = kerσ ≤ Z(M, G) and φ(M) 6= M. For every m ∈ M,
there exists ¯s ∈ S/[R, F ] such that σ(m) = δ(¯s) = σβ(¯s). Hence
m = β(¯s)a, for some a ∈ kerσ. Thus

M = hβ(¯s), a | ¯s ∈

S

[R, F ]

, a ∈ Ai.

Since M = M ′ so

A ≤ Z(M, G) ∩ M ′ ≤ Z(M) ∩ M ′ ≤ φ(M).

Hence

M = hβ(¯s) | ¯s ∈

S

[R, F ]

i

ON RELATIVE CENTRAL EXTENSIONS AND COVERING PAIRS

which implies that β is an epimorphism.

(cid:3)

Corollary 1.2. With the assumptions and notations of the previous
theorem, for every covering pair σ : P → G of (G, N), P is a homo-
morphic image of S/[R, F ].

Note that in Theorem 1.1 if

β(¯sg) = β(¯s)g

for every ¯s ∈ S/[R, F ] and g ∈ G (in other words β preserves the
action), then we can say that every covering pair σ : P → G is a
homomorphic image of δ : S/[R, F ] → G.

Remark 1.3. In 2007 Salemkar, Moghaddam and Chiti [7, Lemma 2.5]
claimed that in the above theorem β is always an epimorphism for any
free presentation G ∼= F/R and N ∼= S/R without any condition. The
following counterexample shows that their claim is not true and hence
one of the main results of their paper [7, Theorem 2.6] is not valid.

Example 1.4. Put G = N = Z ⊕ ... ⊕ Z a free abelian group of
ﬁnite rank with the free presentation G ∼= F/F ′ ∼= N, where F ′ is
the commutator subgroup of the free group F . Consider the following
commutative diagram:

⊆

1 −→ F ′
[F ′,F ]
β| ↓

1 −→ A = Z

F

[F ′,F ]
β ↓

δ−→ G = N = Z ⊕ ... ⊕ Z −→ 1

k

σ−→ G = N = Z ⊕ ... ⊕ Z −→ 1,

α−→ M = G ⊕ Z

where α(x) = (1, x) and σ(g, x) = g, for all x ∈ A, g ∈ G. Then we
have

F ′

β(

[F ′, F ]

F

F

) = [β(

), β(

[F ′, F ]

[F ′, F ]

)] ≤ M ′ = 1.

Hence β is not an epimorphism.

At the end of this section by a result of Ellis [2, Corollary 1.2] on the
Schur multiplier of a pair (G, N) of ﬁnite nilpotent groups we present
a covering pair of the pair (G, N).

Theorem 1.5. Let (G, N) be a pair of ﬁnite nilpotent groups. Assume
i=1 Si, where Si is the Sylow pi-subgroup of G and σi :
Mi → Si for each i = 1, ..., k, is an arbitrary covering pair of the
i=1) =

that G = Qk
pair (Si, Si ∩ N). Then σ : Qk

i=1 Mi → G deﬁned by σ({mi}k

i=1 is a covering pair of (G, N).

{σi(mi)}k
Proof. It is readily seen that σ is a relative central extension of (G, N).
By [2, Corollary 1.2] M(G, N) ∼= Πk
i=1M(Si, Si ∩ N). hence the proof
is straightforward.

2. Some Properties of Covering Pairs

The aim of this section is to introduce a covering pair for a perfect

pair of groups (G, N).

Theorem 2.1. Let (G, N) be a perfect pair of groups. Then for every
covering pair σ : M → G, we have [M, G] = M.
Proof. Since σ : M → G is a covering pair, we have M/kerσ ∼= N and
kerσ ≤ [M, G]. Hence

M/kerσ

[M, G]/kerσ

∼=

N

[N, G]

.

The result is a consequence of (G, N) being perfect.

(cid:3)
It is known that if G ∼= F/R is a group with a covering group G∗,
then there exists a normal subgroup S of F such that R/[R, F ] =
(F ′ ∩ R)/[R, F ] × S/[R, F ], and we have an isomorphism F/S ∼= G∗ [6,
Theorem 2.4.6(iv)(b)]. In the following theorem we intend to extend
this result to pairs of groups.
Theorem 2.2. Let (G, N) be a pair of groups with G ∼= F/R and
N ∼= S/R, where F is the free group on the set G and S E F . Then
for every relative central extension σ : P → G with A ∼= kerσ there is
a normal subgroup T of F such that

R

[R, F ]

=

R ∩ [S, F ]

[R, F ]

×

T

[R, F ]

.

Moreover, there exists an isomorphism S/T ∼= P which carries R/T
onto A.

Proof. Let π : F → G be a surjective homomorphism with R = kerπ.
As the proof of Theorem 1.1, there exists a homomorphism ψ : S → P
which induces the epimorphism β : S/[R, F ] → P . Thus ψ is in fact
an epimorphism. By setting T = kerψ, we have S/T ∼= P . Clearly
ψ(R) = A and by Theorem 1.1, ψ([R, F ]) = 1 so [R, F ] ≤ T which
gives the induced epimorphism ¯ψ : R/[R, F ] → A. Considering

¯ψ| :

R ∩ [S, F ]

[R, F ]

→ A,

we claim that ¯ψ| is an isomorphism. To prove this, let a ∈ A. By
ψ(R) = A there exists x ∈ R such that a = ψ(x). On the other hand
for every p ∈ P and g ∈ G,

[p, g] = [β(¯s), g] = β(¯s−1)β(¯sg).

ON RELATIVE CENTRAL EXTENSIONS AND COVERING PAIRS

Easily it can be seen that

β(¯sg) = (cid:26) β(¯s)g

β(¯s)β(¯r)

if g ∈ N
if g /∈ N

for some ¯r ∈ R/[R, F ].
Thus by the proof of Theorem 1.1,

P = hβ(¯s) | ¯s ∈

S

[R, F ]

\

R

[R, F ]

i.

Since P is perfect and so (G, N) is perfect, we have [S, F ]R = S.
On the other hand A = ψ(R) ≤ φ(P ). Therefore [P, G] ≤ ψ([S, F ]).
This fact and A ≤ [M, G] imply that a = ψ(y) for some y ∈ [S, F ].
Thus ψ(x) = a = ψ(y), hence x−1y ∈ kerψ ≤ R, so that y ∈ R ∩
[S, F ]. Since A ∼= M(G, N) ∼= (R ∩ [S, F ])/[R, F ] and A is ﬁnite, ¯ψ|
is an isomorphism. By surjectivity of ¯ψ, for every ¯r ∈ R/[R, F ] there
exists ¯x ∈ (R ∩ [S, F ])/[R, F ] such that ¯ψ(¯x)= ¯ψ(¯r), thus ¯x−1¯r ∈ kerψ.
Consequently

R

[R, F ]

= ker ¯ψ

R ∩ [S, F ]

[R, F ]

.

Let ¯x ∈ ker ¯ψ ∩ (R ∩ [S, F ])/[R, F ]. Then ¯x ∈ ker ¯ψ| = 1, so we have
the following isomorphism

R

[R, F ]

∼= ker ¯ψ ×

R ∩ [S, F ]

[R, F ]

Theorem 2.3. Let σi : Mi → G, i = 1, 2 be two covering pairs of a
ﬁnite pair (G, N). If Mi = M ′
(i)M1
(ii)M1/Z(M1, G) ∼= M2/Z(M2, G);
(iii)Z(M1, G)/kerσ1

i and φ(Mi) 6= Mi for i = 1, 2, then

∼= Z(M2, G)/kerσ2.

∼= M2;

Proof. (i) Let σ : M ∗ → G be a ﬁxed arbitrary covering pair with the
following relative central extension

1 → A → M ∗ → N → 1

such that A ⊆ Z(M ∗, G) ∩ [M ∗, G] and A ∼= M(G, N). Since [N, G] =
N and [M ∗, G] = M ∗ so σ : [M ∗, G] → [N, G] is an epimorphism.
Therefore

|[N, G]|.

POURMIRZAEI, HASSANZADEH AND MASHAYEKHY

Suppose that G ∼= F/R such that F is the free group on the set G with
N ∼= S/R. By Theorem 1.1, we have the following diagram

Since [S/[R, F ], G] = [S, F ]/[R, F ] and δ| : [S, F ]/[R, F ] → [N, G] is an
epimorphism, thus

|M ∗| = |[M ∗, G]| = |

If ¯s ∈ S/[R, F ] and g ∈ G,

β([¯s, g]) = β(¯s)−1β(¯sg) = (cid:26) β(¯s)−1β(¯s)g = [β(¯s), g]

β(¯s)−1β(¯s) = 1

if g ∈ N
if g /∈ N

which yields that β([S, F ]/[R, F ]) ≤ [M ∗, G]. By Theorem 2.1, M ∗ =
[M ∗, G] ≤ β([S, F ]/[R, F ]) which implies that M ∗ ∼= [S, F ]/[R, F ].
(ii) By Theorem 2.2 there exists a normal subgroup T of F with
M ∗ ∼= S/T. This yields naturally an action of G on S/T which implies
Z(S/T, G) = Z(M ∗, G). Put Z(S/T, G) = L/T. Let x ∈ Z(S/[R, F ], G).
Then [x, g] ∈ [R, F ] ≤ T and so Z(S/[R, F ], G) ≤ L/[R, F ]. To
prove the reverse containment, assume that x[R, F ] ∈ L/[R, F ], then
[x, g] ∈ T ≤ R ∩ [S, F ] ∩ T = [R, F ], hence

L

Consequently, it may be inferred that

The desired assertion is now a consequence of the fact that S/L is

ON RELATIVE CENTRAL EXTENSIONS AND COVERING PAIRS

Theorem 2.4. Let (G, N) be a perfect pair of groups with a free pre-
sentation G ∼= F/R and N ∼= S/R. Then
(i) δ : [S, F ]/[R, F ] → G by δ(x[R, F ]) = xR, is a covering pair of
(G, N)
(ii) The relative central extension δ : [S, F ]/[R, F ] → G is the universal
object in the category RCE (G, N).

Proof. (i) Consider the following action of G on [S, F ]/[R, F ]

[S, F ]
[R, F ]

× G →

[S, F ]
[R, F ]

([s, f ][R, F ], g) 7→ ([s, f ][R, F ])g = [st, f t][R, F ],

where π : F → G is the epimorphism with kerπ = R and π(t) = g. By
the assumption G = NQ, let Q ∼= T /R. Since (G, N) is a perfect pair,
[N, G] = N and therefore ([S, F ]R)/R = S/R. It can be shown that
δ : [S, F ]/[R, F ] → G is a relative central extension of the pair (G, N).
On the other hand, since

kerδ = (R ∩ [S, F ])/[R, F ] ∼= M(G, N),

we have

[S, F ]/[R, F ]

kerδ

∼=

[S, F ]

R ∩ [S, F ]

∼=

[S, F ]R

R

=

S
R

∼= N.

It is enough to show that

kerδ ≤ [

[S, F ]
[R, F ]

, G].

For this we show that [[S, F ]/[R, F ], G] = [S, F ]/[R, F ]. Clearly

[[S, F ]/[R, F ], G] ≤ [S, F ]/[R, F ].

So we only need to show the reverse containment. We know that

[

[S, F ]
[R, F ]

, G] = h[x, g]|x ∈

[S, F ]
[R, F ]

, g ∈ Gi

such that

[x, g] = x−1xg = [s, f ][R, F ]−1([s, f ][R, F ])g = [s, f ]−1[s, f ]t[R, F ],

for some s ∈ S and f ∈ F , where π(t) = g. Since S = [S, F ]R, for
every s ∈ S there exist s′ ∈ S, l ∈ F and r ∈ R such that
[s, f ] = [[s′, l]r, f ] = [[s′, l], f ][[s′, l], f, r][r, f ].

Hence [S, F ]/[R, F ] ≤ [[S, F ]/[R, F ], G].
(ii) Let σ : M → G be a relative central extension of the pair (G, N),
and F be the free group on the set G and S E F such that G ∼= F/R

10

POURMIRZAEI, HASSANZADEH AND MASHAYEKHY

and N ∼= S/R. Then consider δ : [S, F ]/[R, F ] → G as mentioned in
the previous part. By Theorem1.1, there exists a homomorphism

ϕ : [S, F ]/[R, F ] → M

such that ϕ = β|[S,F ]/[R,F ]. Now for every g ∈ G and ¯x ∈ [S, F ]/[R, F ],

ϕ(¯xg) = β(¯xg) = (cid:26) β(¯x)g = ϕ(¯x)g

β(¯x) = ϕ (¯x)

if g ∈ N
if g /∈ N

We have to prove ϕ preserves the action. To do this it is enough to
show that ϕ(¯x)g = ϕ(¯x) for every g ∈ G and ¯x ∈ [S, F ]/[R, F ]. Deﬁne

f :

S

[R, F ]

→ M

¯s 7→ β(¯s)gβ(¯s)−1.

For every g ∈ G and ¯x ∈ [S, F ]/[R, F ], f (¯s) ∈ Z(G, M) so

f (¯sg) = β(¯sg)gβ(¯sg)−1 = (cid:26) (β(¯s)g)g(β(¯s)−1)

β(¯s)gβ(¯s)−1

g

= f (¯s)g

if g ∈ N
if g /∈ N

Thus,

f ([¯s, g]) = f (¯s−1¯sg) = (cid:26) f (¯s)−1f (¯s)g = [f (¯s), g] = 1 if g ∈ N

f (¯s)−1f (¯s) = 1

if g /∈ N

By part (i)

Therefore

f (

[S, F ]
[R, F ]

) = f ([

[S, F ]
[R, F ]

, G]) = 1.

ϕ(¯xg) = β(¯xg) = β(¯x)g = ϕ(¯x)g.

We claim that ϕ is unique. By contrary, let ϕi : [S, F ]/[R, F ] → M,
i = 1, 2, be homomorphisms such that

Deﬁne

σϕ1(¯s) = δ(¯s) = σϕ2(¯s).

¯x 7→ ϕ1(¯x)ϕ2

−1(¯x).

−1(¯xg) = ϕ1(¯x)g(ϕ2

If g ∈ G and ¯x ∈ [S, F ]/[R, F ],
ψ(¯xg) = ϕ1(¯xg)ϕ2
Consequently ψ([¯x, g]) = [ψ(¯x), g] = 1. Now by (i) we have
[[S, F ]/[R, F ], G] = [S, F ]/[R, F ] which implies that ψ = 1. Hence the
results holds.
(cid:3)

−1(¯x))g = (ϕ1(¯x)ϕ2

−1(¯x))g = ψ(¯x)g.

ON RELATIVE CENTRAL EXTENSIONS AND COVERING PAIRS

Note that if (G, N) is a pair of groups with a free presentation G ∼=
F/R and N ∼= S/R, then [S, F ]/[R, F ] is independent of the choice of
the free presentation of (G, N).

The following theorem states a necessary and suﬃcient condition for
a pair of groups to be perfect. It should be noted that Loday [5] proved
the following result using homological method but our proof is diﬀerent
and seems elementary.

Theorem 2.5. A pair of groups (G, N) is perfect pair if and only if
the category RCE (G, N) has a universal relative central extension.

Proof. Necessity is Theorem 2.4. For suﬃciency, let

1 → A → M

ρ
→ G → 1

be a universal relative central extension of the pair (G, N). Consider
the following relative central extension

1 → A ×

N

[N, G]

→ M ×

N

[N, G]

ψ
→ N → 1,

where ψ(m, ¯n) = ρ(m), m ∈ M, ¯n ∈ N/[N, G]. Deﬁne homomorphisms

θi : M → M ×

N

[N, G]

,

i = 1, 2, by θ1(m) = (m, 1) and θ2(m) = (m, ρ(m)). Then we have
ψθi = ρ, i = 1, 2, where θ1 = θ2. Consequently, N = [N, G] and hence
(G, N) is a perfect pair.
(cid:3)

Finally, we intend to consider a covering pair as a pair of groups. If
σ : M → G is a covering pair of (G, N), then there exists a subgroup A
of M such that A ⊆ Z(M, G) ∩ [M, G], A ∼= M(G, N) and M/A ∼= N.
Now, we can consider (M, A) as a covering pair of (G, N). It is known
that any two covering groups of a ﬁnite group G are isoclinic. Moreover,
if G is a ﬁnite perfect pair of groups, then a covering group of G is also
perfect. We intend to investigate these facts for a covering pair as our
new point of view of a covering pair of groups. In this way, the notion
of isoclinism for the pair of groups is needed which we review it of [8].

Deﬁnition 2.6. Let (G, N) and (H, K) be two pairs of groups. The
pairs (G, N) and (H, K) are said to be isoclinic if there exists iso-
morphisms ǫ : G/Z(G, N) → H/Z(H, K) and η : [G, N] → [H, K]
such that ǫ(N/Z(G, N)) = K/Z(H, K) and η([g, n]) = [h, k] whenever
ǫ(gZ(G, N)) = hZ(H, K) and η(nZ(G, N)) = kZ(H, K). This concept
is denoted as (G, N) ∼ (H, K).

It is a well-known fact that all covering groups of a given ﬁnite group
are mutually isoclinic (see [4]). The following lemma helps us to prove
this fact for some special types of covering pairs for arbitrary pair of
groups.

Lemma 2.7. Let (G,N) and (H,K) be two pairs of groups. If θ : G →
H is an epimorphism such that θ(N) = K and kerθ ∩ N = 1, then
(G, N) ∼ (H, K).

Proof. Deﬁne ǫ : G/Z(G, N) → H/Z(H, K) such that ǫ(gZ(G, N)) =
θ(h)Z(H, K) and ϕ : [N, G] → [K, H] by ϕ([n, g]) = [θ(n), θ(g)]. We
can easily see that ǫ and ϕ are isomorphisms which yields that (G, N) ∼
(H, K).

Theorem 2.8. Let (G, N) be a pair of groups. Then every two covering
pairs (Pi, Ai), i = 1, 2, where Pi = P ′
i and φ(Pi) 6= Pi of (G, N) are
isoclinic.

Proof. By the proof of Theorem 2.2 if (P, A) is a covering pair of
(G, N) then there exists an epimorphism β : S/[R, F ] → P such that
ψ(([S, F ] ∩ R)/[R, F ]) = A. Clearly

kerψ ∩ [

S

[R, F ]

,

[S, F ] ∩ R

[R, F ]

] = 1.

Using Lemma 2.7 we obtain

(P, A) ∼ (

S

[R, F ]

,

[S, F ] ∩ R

[R, F ]

).

The following results can be easily obtained if we use the notion
of isoclinism for a perfect pair of groups. Note that these results are
generalizations of similar results for perfect groups to perfect pairs (
see [4, Lemma 2.4, Corollary 2.5 and Proposition 2.6]).

Lemma 2.9. Let (G, N) be a ﬁnite perfect pair of groups, and (H, K)
be any ﬁnite pair of groups which is isoclinic to (G, N). Then K is
isomorphic to

N × Z(H, K)

Z(G, N) × (Z(H, K) ∩ [H, K])

.

Corollary 2.10. Let (G, N) be a ﬁnite perfect pair of groups with
trivial center. Then for any pair of groups isoclinic to (G, N), say
(H, K), we have K is isomorphic to direct product of N and an abelian
group.

Proposition 2.11. Let (G, N) be a ﬁnite perfect pair of groups, and
(H, K) be any pair which is isoclinic to (G, N) such that |N| = |K|.
Then N ∼= K.

Proof. The result follows from Lemma 3.9 and the assumption that
|K| = |N|.
