An Ancient Diophantine Equation

with applications to

Numerical Curios and Geometric Series

Ajai Choudhry and Jaros law Wr´oblewski

Abstract

In this paper we examine the diophantine equation xk − yk = x− y
where k is a positive integer ≥ 2, and consider its applications. While
the complete solution of the equation xk − yk = x − y in positive
rational numbers is already known when k = 2 or 3, till now only

one numerical solution of the equation in positive rational numbers

has been published when k = 4, and no nontrivial solution is known
when k ≥ 5. We describe a method of generating inﬁnitely many
positive rational solutions of the equation when k = 4. We use the

positive rational solutions of the equation with k = 2, 3 or 4 to produce

numerical curios involving square roots, cube roots and fourth roots,

and as another application of these solutions, we show how to construct

examples of geometric series with an interesting property.

Keywords: cube roots; fourth roots; cubes; biquadrates; geometric series;

cubic diophantine equation.

This is not an isolated curiosity. There exist inﬁnitely many similar identi-

ties involving square roots, cube roots and fourth roots. Surprisingly, such

identities may be obtained from positive rational solutions of the diophan-

tine equation,

(2)

ak − bk = a − b,

where k is a given positive integer ≥ 2.

When k = 2, Eq. (2) reduces to the trivial equation a + b = 1. When

k = 3, Eq. (2) dates back to Diophantus who gave a numerical solution in

his Arithmetica [2, p. 173]. The complete solution of (2) with k = 3 is

readily obtained and is already known. When k = 4, a single numerical

solution of Eq. (2) in positive rational numbers was obtained by Fermat [2,

pp. 319-20]. Till now, no other solutions of Eq. (2) in positive rational

numbers have been published when k = 4. Further, no nontrivial solutions

of (2) are known when k ≥ 5.

In Section 2, we examine Eq. (2) and, in particular, we describe a method

of generating inﬁnitely many positive rational solutions of the equation when

k = 4. In Section 3, we describe how identities of the type (1) may be derived

using the solutions of (2). Finally, in Section 4, we give an application of

the solutions of the equation (2) to the construction of convergent geometric

n=1 an with positive rational terms and having the striking property

2 The diophantine equation ak − bk = a − b

2.1

For any positive integer value of k, the diophantine equation (2) always has

the trivial solutions (a, b) = (1, 0), (a, b) = (0, 1) and (a, b) = (m, m) where

m is an arbitrary rational number. Any solution other than these trivial

solutions will be called a nontrivial solution.

For a nontrivial solution, a 6= b, and so we may cancel out the factor a−b
from both sides of (2) . As already noted, when k = 2, Eq. (2) reduces to the

trivial equation a + b = 1 that has the obvious solution (a, b) = (m, 1 − m)
where m is an arbitrary parameter. This yields nontrivial solutions involving

negative integers as well as solutions in positive rational numbers when m

is rational and 0 < m < 1. When k > 2, it is readily seen that Eq. (2) has

no nontrivial solutions in integers.

When k = 3, Eq. (2) reduces, on cancelling out the factor a − b, to
the quadratic equation a2 + ab + b2 = 1 whose complete solution is readily

obtained, and is given by,

(4)

a =

m2 − n2

m2 + mn + n2 ,

b =

2mn + n2

m2 + mn + n2 ,

where m and n are arbitrary integer parameters. When m = 3, n = 1, we

get the numerical solution

(5)

(a, b) = (8/13, 7/13),

which is the solution given by Diophantus to which a reference was made in

the Introduction.

2.2

We now consider the equation,

(6)

a4 − b4 = a − b

obtained by taking k = 4 in (2).

3

The solution of (6) found by Fermat is given below:

(7)

a = 26793/34540,

b = 15799/34540.

The same numerical solution of Eq. (6), found by three diﬀerent methods, is

given in [3, Part I, pp. 48-51]. Till date no other solution of (6) in positive

rational numbers has been published. There is a brief comment on Eq. (6)

by Scott and Styer [4] who, referring to Skolem’s book [5], have stated that

this equation has inﬁnitely many solutions in positive rational numbers.

Eq. (6) reduces, on cancelling out the factor a − b to the cubic equation,

(8)

a3 + a2b + ab2 + b3 = 1,

which represents an elliptic curve. On applying the birational transforma-

tion given by

(9)

and

(10)

a = (y + 2)/(2x),

b = −(y − 2)/(2x),

x = 2/(a + b),

y = 2(a − b)/(a + b),

the cubic equation (8) reduces to the following Weierstrass model of an

elliptic curve:

(11)

y2 = x3 − 4.

Equations (9) and (10) establish a one-one correspondence between the

rational solutions of Eq. (8) and the rational points on the elliptic curve

(11).

It is readily veriﬁed from Cremona’s well-known tables on elliptic

curves that Eq. (11) deﬁnes an elliptic curve over Q of rank 1 and a basis

for the Mordell-Weil group is given by the point P with co-ordinates (2, 2).

Fermat’s solution (7) corresponds to the point A on the elliptic curve

(11) given by (X, Y ) = (785/484, 5497/10648). Since the curve (11) has

positive rank, there are inﬁnitely many rational points on the elliptic curve

4

(11) and it follows from a theorem of Poincare and Hurwitz [5, Satz 11,

p. 78] that there are inﬁnitely many rational points in the neighbourhood

of the point A, and these points correspond to inﬁnitely many solutions in

positive rational numbers of Eq. (8) as stated by Scott and Styer.

The aforementioned theorem of Poincare and Hurwitz does not give any

method of generating the inﬁnitely many rational points in the neighbour-

hood of the point A, and hence is of no help in ﬁnding solutions of Eq. (6)

in positive rational numbers. We give below a method of ﬁnding inﬁnitely

many solutions of Eq. (6) in positive rational numbers.

It follows from Eqs. (8), (9) and (10) that the points (1, 0) and (0, 1)

on the curve (8) correspond to the points (2, 2) and (2, −2) respectively
on the curve (11) and there is a one-one correspondence between points on

the curve (8) with positive rational coordinates and rational points on the

curve (11) with 22/3 < x < 2. We will ﬁrst generate an inﬁnite sequence

of rational points on the curve (11) with 22/3 < x < 2, and then use the

relations (9) to ﬁnd inﬁnitely many positive rational solutions of (8).

Let P1 be a known rational point on the curve (11) with co-ordinates

(x1, y1) such that 22/3 < x1 < 2 and y1 > 0. Using the group law, we now

compute the point Q = 2P1 − P on the curve (11). The abscissa x2 of the
point Q is given by,

x2 = 2{x8

1 + 8x7

1 − 64x6

1 + 64x5

1 + 224x4

1 + 512x3

1 + 1024x2

(12)

− 1024x1 − 1024 + (4x6

1 − 320x3
1 + 32x1 + 32)−2.

× (x4

1 − 8x3

1 − 512)y1}

We will now show that 22/3 < x2 < 2. The ﬁrst part of this inequality is

readily established since Q is a rational point that lies on the curve (11),

and so it follows that 22/3 < x2. To prove the second part, we note that,

2 − x2 = 8{(−x6

1 + 80x3

1 + 128)y1 − 2(3x4

1 − 16x3

1 + 96x1 + 64)

(13)

× (x3

1 − 4)}(x4

1 − 8x3

1 + 32x1 + 32)−2.

and since 22/3 < x1 < 2 and y1 > 0, therefore (−x6

1 + 80x3

1 + 128)y1 > 0 and

5

also 2(3x4

1 − 16x3

1 + 96x1 + 64)(x3

1 − 4) > 0. Further, since y2

1 = x3

1 − 4, we

have,

(14) {(−x6

1 + 80x3

= (x1 − 2)(x3

1 + 128)y1}2 − {2(3x4
1 − 4)(x3

1 − 18x2

1 − 16x3

1 + 96x1 + 64)(x3

1 − 4)}2
1 + 32x1 + 32)2.

1 − 36x1 − 40)(x4

1 − 8x3

Since 22/3 < x1 < 2, it is readily seen that the quantity on the right-hand

side of (14) is positive. It follows that

(15)

1 + 80x3

1 + 128)y1 > 2(3x4

1 + 96x1 + 64)(x3

1 − 16x3

(−x6

1 − 4),

and therefore, from (13), we get 2 − x2 > 0. We have thus proved that
22/3 < x2 < 2.

The two points Q and −Q on the curve (11) have the same positive
abscissa x2 and one of them necessarily has positive ordinate as well. We

take P2 to be either Q or −Q such that both the co-ordinates of P2 are
positive.

Thus, starting from a known point P1 on the curve (11) given by (x1, y1)

with 22/3 < x1 < 2 and y1 > 0, we have generated a new point P2 on

(11) given by (x2, y2) with 22/3 < x2 < 2 and y2 > 0. We now start

with the point P2 and repeat the process described above to get a new

point P3 whose co-ordinates (x3, y3) satisfy the relations 22/3 < x3 < 2 and

y3 > 0. In fact, we can execute this process repeatedly to get an inﬁnite

sequence of points P1, P2, P3,

. . . , Pn, . . . , on the curve (11) given by
(xi, yi), i = 1, 2, 3, . . . , n, . . . such that for each i, we have 22/3 < xi < 2

and yi > 0. We will now show that with a suitably chosen initial point P1,

all the points of this sequence are distinct.

If we take the point P1 as n1P where 2 < |n1|, then the point Q =
2P1 − P = (2n1 − 1)P , and so we get P2 = n2P where n2 is either 2n1 − 1
or −2n1 + 1. Thus, 2 < |n1| < |n2|, and, by induction, it follows that the
sequence of points P1, P2, P3, . . . , Pn, . . . , is given by n1P, n2P, n3P, . . . ,

where the absolute values of ni form a strictly increasing sequence of positive

6

integers. Since the point P is a point of inﬁnite order, we are assured of an

inﬁnite sequence of distinct rational points (xi, yi) on the curve (11) with
22/3 < xi < 2 and yi > 0. Finally, we use the relations (9) to obtain a

corresponding sequence of inﬁnitely many points on the curve (8) whose

co-ordinates are positive rational numbers.

As an example, if we take the point P1 as the point A given by (785/484,

5497/10648) which is −4P , we obtain an inﬁnite sequence of points P1, P2,
P3, . . . , Pn, . . . , with the speciﬁed properties. The point P2 of this sequence

is given by

(16)

(8152570498330546/4944742493612769,

241351355149002573947470/347708669978634678361647).

The next point of the sequence, that is P3, has co-ordinates involving integers

with 85 digits and is therefore omitted. The solution of (6) corresponding

to the point P2 is given by,

a = 234192173776567982667691/286639743984973696444599,

b = 113516496202066695693956/286639743984973696444599.

(17)

2.3

Finally we note that when k ≥ 5, Eq. (2) represents a curve of genus > 1,
and by Falting’s theorem, it can have only ﬁnitely many rational solutions.

Limited trials conducted on Eq. (2) with k = 5 yielded no nontrivial so-

lutions. It appears that Eq. (2) has no nontrivial rational solutions when

k ≥ 5.

3 Numerical Curios Involving Radicals

We now show how to obtain inﬁnitely many numerical curiosities involving

radicals and rational numbers of the type (1).

It is easily seen that any

7

solution of Eq. (2) leads to

(18)

k√bk + d =

kpbk + d and

k√ak − d =

kpak − d,

where d = ak − bk = a − b.

When k = 2, the simple solution a = 2/3, b = 1/3 of Eq. (2) yields the

examples,

The solution (7) of Eq. (6) given by Fermat yields the identity (1) given

at the beginning of this paper. The inﬁnitely many solutions in positive

rational numbers of Eq. (2) when k = 2, 3, or 4 yield inﬁnitely many similar

identities.

4 Geometric Series with an interesting property

Solutions of the diophantine equation (2) also enable us to construct exam-

ples of convergent geometric series P∞

possessing the interesting property described by Eq. (3).

In view of the formula for the sum of inﬁnite geometric series, Eq. (3)

which is equivalent to the equation (2) by substituting a = 1/a1 and b = r/a1

or equivalently, a1 = 1/a and r = b/a. To ensure that the two geometric

series are convergent, we choose a, b such that b < a, and hence r < 1.

The inﬁnitely many solutions of (2) with k = 2, 3 or 4 yield inﬁnitely

many examples of geometric series satisfying Eq. (3). As a numerical ex-

ample, the solution (5) of Eq. (2) when k = 3 leads to the two geometric

series,

both of which have the same common sum, namely 13.

As a second example, the solution a = 26793/34540, b = 15799/34540 of

Eq. (6) leads to the geometric series deﬁned by
