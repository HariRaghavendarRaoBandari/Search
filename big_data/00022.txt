Abstract: In this letter we provide a complete holographic reconstruction of the cubic
couplings in the minimal bosonic higher-spin theory in AdSd+1. For this purpose we also
determine the OPE coeﬃcients of all single-trace conserved currents in the d-dimensional
free scalar O (N ) vector model, and compute the tree-level three-point Witten diagram
amplitudes for a generic cubic interaction of higher-spin gauge ﬁelds in the metric-like
formulation.

1 Introduction

Despite the long existence of fully non-linear equations of motion [1] for theories of higher-
spin gauge ﬁelds, a complete list of Lagrangian cubic couplings is unknown. The main
diﬃculty has been in taking the Noether procedure beyond the cubic order. Indeed, cubic
consistency leaves the relative coeﬃcients of the possible cubic interactions arbitrary. So
far only a small number of Lagrangian couplings have been determined, in particular those
which are constrained by the higher-spin algebra structure constants [2–6].

In this letter we take an alternative route, and ﬁnd a complete list of cubic couplings for
the type A minimal bosonic higher-spin theory in anti-de Sitter (AdS) space as determined
by holographic reconstruction. For higher-spin symmetry preserving boundary conditions,
the latter theory is conjectured [7, 8] to be dual to (the singlet sector of) the free scalar
O (N ) vector model. For the duality to hold, the cubic interactions of the bulk theory must
reproduce the three-point correlators of the dual CFT. From this basic requirement, we
are able to determine all bulk cubic couplings of the minimal bosonic higher-spin theory.
As a non-trivial check of our holographic reconstruction, we relate the couplings obtained
to the metric-like classiﬁcation of gauge invariant bulk couplings in [9–11].

To reach our goal of a complete set of cubic couplings, we established two main intermediate
results:

1. The explicit form of all two- and three-point functions of conserved currents in the

singlet sector of the d-dimensional free scalar O (N ) vector model.

2. The amplitude of a three-point Witten diagram for an arbitrary triplet (s1, s2, s3) of
external higher-spin gauge ﬁelds, generated by a generic consistent cubic interaction
(with arbitrary relative coeﬃcients).

This work constitutes a key step of the holographic reconstruction program, which began
with the extraction of the 0-0-s cubic couplings [12–15] and scalar quartic self-interaction
[13, 16, 17]. See also the subsequent work [18], which gave a simple extension of the cubic
0-0-s results to the type B theory.1 We give a more detailed summary of the present
ﬁndings in the following section.

Remarks:

• The above result is nicely factorised, as expected from a free CFT. Notice that the
overall coeﬃcients (1.5) are simply a product of s-0-0 OPE coeﬃcients. This gen-
eralises the result [21] for the latter to three-point functions of an arbitrary triplet
(s1, s2, s3) of single-trace operators.

• The Bessel function form (1.3) of tensor structures generated are consistent with
those observed in the literature for three-point functions of arbitrary spin conserved
currents [22–25].

• With the simple factorised result (1.3), it is tempting to conjecture that the form of
any n-point function of such currents is given by simply extending the product from

Complete cubic couplings for minimal higher-spin theory

The most general cubic vertex in AdSd+1 is parameterised by six basic contractions. These
are the bulk counterparts of the six conformal structures on the boundary (1.1). Using
point-splitting, the most general (on-shell) cubic interaction involving ﬁelds of spins s1-s2-
s3 is given by [9]:

We work using the ambient space formulation of symmetric and traceless ﬁelds, which
we brieﬂy review in Section 3 and Appendix B. In appendix D we complete the vertices
obtained to the de Donder gauge. The most general such cubic interaction thus takes the

Under the conjectured duality with the free scalar O (N ) vector model [8], the tree-level
Witten diagram generated by the bulk s1-s2-s3 cubic vertex (1.10) in type A minimal
bosonic higher-spin theory must be equal to the dual three-point function (1.3) in the free
scalar O (N ) vector model. Employing this correspondence, we determine the complete
cubic action holographically to be

and a canonical normalisation for the kinetic term of the higher-spin ﬁelds. Notice that
in the chosen basis for bulk interactions the cubic vertex only involves structures with
ni = 0. These terms however, once radially reduced, generate the necessary non-abelian
quasi-minimal couplings of the HS theory (see e.g. [9, 11]). Nicely all these terms can be
resummed into a single ambient structure (see Appendix B for the reduction to intrinsic
quantities and Appendix C for the relation with previous classiﬁcations and Appendix D
for the oﬀ-shell completion to the de Donder gauge).

2 Single-trace OPE coeﬃcients

2.1 Generating function for conserved currents

We ﬁrst introduce some useful technology for dealing with conserved currents of arbitrary
spin in CFT, and their correlation functions.

The conserved currents we consider in this paper reside in the singlet sector of the free
scalar O (N ) vector model, which are traceless bi-linears in the fundamental scalar φa [26]:

Jµ1...µs ∼ φa∂µ1...∂µsφa + ...,

a = 1, ..., N .

(2.1)

In the above, the . . . are further singlet bi-linear structures, which ensure conservation and
tracelessness. Moreover, these currents are non-trivial only for even spins s.

It is convenient to use index-free notation, introducing a null polarisation vector

Js (x|z) ≡ Jµ1...µszµ1...zµs ,

(2.2)

where tracelessness is encoded in the null condition z2 = 0. They can then be packaged in
the compact expression,

Js (x|z) = f (s) (z · ∂x1, z · ∂x2) φa (x1) φa (x2)(cid:12)(cid:12)x1,x2→x ,

(2.3)

where the function f (s) (x, y) is given in terms of a Gegenbauer polynomial,

f (s) (x, y) = (x + y)s C

∆−1
2 )

(
s

,

(2.4)

x + y

and ∆
2 denotes the scaling dimension of φa. This is an old trick [27], and can easily be
derived by demanding that the expression (2.3) is annihilated by the conformal boost
operator. This gives the diﬀerential equation for f (s)(x, y),

2 + x ∂x)∂x + ( ∆

(cid:3) f (s)(x, y) = 0 ,

– 4 –

whose solution is expressed in terms of the Gegenbauer polynomials above.2 For ∆ = d− 2,
which is twice the dimension of a free boson, the primary operator has dimension d− 2 + s
and saturates the unitarity bound for s > 0. For this scaling dimension we thus obtain
conserved currents, which is straightforward to verify.

The form (2.3) of the conserved currents plays a crucial role in the following sections,
as it allows for the seamless application of Wick’s theorem to determine their two- and
three-point functions.

2.2 Two-point functions

Conformal symmetry ﬁxes two-point functions up to an overall coeﬃcient, with those of
spin-s conserved currents (2.3) taking the form

(cid:104)Js (x1|z1)Js (x2|z2)(cid:105) = CJs

(2.6)

We determine the overall coeﬃcient CJs for the currents (2.3) in the following.

Since the theory is free, we may simply apply Wick’s theorem to express the two-point
function in terms of that of the fundamental scalar. We have
(cid:104)Js (x1|z1)Js (x2|z2)(cid:105) = f (s)(z1 · ∂y1, z1 · ∂y2)f (s)(z2 · ∂¯y1, z2 · ∂¯y2)

×(cid:104)(cid:104)φa(y1)φa(y2)(cid:105)(cid:104)φb(¯y1)φb(¯y2)(cid:105) + φa(y2) ↔ φb(¯y1) + φa(y2) ↔ φb(¯y1)
(cid:105)

.

(2.7)

To extract the overall two-point coeﬃcient, by conformal invariance it is suﬃcient to restrict
attention to terms with zero contractions of the null auxiliary vectors. We thus set to zero
z1 · z2, and match with the corresponding term in (2.6). The computation is drastically
simpliﬁed using the Schwinger-parametrised form

2.3 Three-point functions and OPE coeﬃcients

We now turn to the three-point functions of the conserved currents, and employ the same
approach as for the two-point functions in the previous section: A combination of Wick’s
theorem and Schwinger parameterisation. For previous results in three-dimensions, see
[28–30].

2The above equation can be generalised to deal with scalar operators made of constituents with diﬀerent
dimensions ∆1/2 and ∆2/2 respectively. The corresponding primary is in this case a Jacobi polynomial

Three-point functions of conserved currents

tion of a generic triplet of conserved currents has the form

3 Three-point Witten diagrams

We now turn to the bulk side of the story. The three-point correlation functions of con-
served currents computed in the previous section are dual to three-point Witten diagrams
generated by cubic interactions of the corresponding bulk gauge ﬁelds. In this section we
compute the three-point amplitudes for a generic such cubic interaction, thus providing
the dictionary between bulk cubic couplings and the boundary CFT correlators.

3.1 Brief review of the ambient space formalism

It is convenient to employ the ambient space formalism, in which AdSd+1 space is realised
as a hyperboloid in an ambient (d + 2)-dimensional Minkowski space

X 2 + 1 = 0 ,

X 0 > 0 .

(3.1)

In this section we give a brief overview of the relevant aspects of this framework, and direct
the unfamiliar reader to e.g. [31–35] for further details.

Fields intrinsic to AdSd+1 space can be represented by homogeneous ﬁelds in ambient space
that are tangent to the hyperboloid (3.1). As for the CFT discussion above, it is useful to
encode tensor structures in polynomials of auxiliary variables. Symmetric rank-s tensors
can be described by

ΦM1...Ms(X)U M1 . . . U Ms .
subject to the following homogeneity and tangentiality conditions

Φ(X, U ) =

1
s!

(X · ∂X − ∆)Φ(X, U ) = 0 ,

X · ∂U Φ(X, U ) = 0 .

(3.2)

Above the degree of homogeneity for ambient symmetric ﬁelds is chosen to be compatible
with the AdS/CFT dictionary for ﬁelds dual to conserved currents3

∆ = 2 − d − s .

(3.4)

3Notice that this choice corresponds to the normalisable solution at the boundary of AdSd+1. In [9] the
opposite choice ∆ = s − 2 was made, as it simpliﬁed the analysis of gauge invariance. The two choices are
related by a change of basis in the space of couplings and are completely equivalent.

Figure 1. Euclidean AdS and its boundary in ambient space. This ﬁgure displays the AdS surface
X 2 = −R2 = −1 and the identiﬁcation of a (green) boundary point with a (green) light ray of the
light cone P 2 = 0, which intersects the Poincar´e section (3.5) on a (red) point

The boundary of AdSd+1 is described by the hypercone P 2 = 0. It is then convenient to
introduce auxiliary variables ZA(x) to be contracted with the CFT currents deﬁned on
the hypercone at the boundary point x. The explicit relation between the ambient and
intrinsic variables can be obtained solving the constraints in some given coordinate system.
It is usually given employing ambient light cone coordinates X A = (X +, X−, X a) as

ZB(x) = (0, 2x · z, zb) ,

P B(x) = (1, x2, xb) ,

where X 2 = −X +X− + δabX aX b. We include ﬁgure 3.1 for clarity.

3.2 Cubic couplings and their Witten diagrams

In the ambient framework it is straightforward to parameterise the most general on-shell
cubic interaction up to integrations by parts. As explained in the introduction, on-shell
the most general cubic interaction involving ﬁelds of spins s1-s2-s3 is given by

Vs1,s2,s3 =

In the next section we determine the couplings gn1,n2,n3
in minimal bosonic higher-spin the-
s1,s2,s3
ory by employing the holographic duality. We do so by matching the tree-level three-point
Witten diagram generated by the vertex (3.6) with the corresponding three-point function
(1.3) in the dual free scalar O (N ) vector model. We use the following two ingredients:

that the simplest structure with n1 = n2 = n3 = 0 is singled out when demanding that we
generate the precise combination of boundary structures of the dual free CFT correlator

This identiﬁes the bulk structure that reproduces the free scalar CFT correlator up to an
overall coeﬃcient.

A few remarks are in order:

• The dependence on the spins si is completely factorised but for the overall Gamma

function prefactor coming from the AdS integration.

• Remarkably, a single ambient structure resums all couplings including the quasi-
mininal structures present in the higher spin theory [9, 37, 38]. In Appendix B we
outline how the lower derivative terms are generated upon translating the result in
terms of AdS covariant derivatives. We also provide a recursive solution for the radial
reduction.

• We have checked that above couplings are gauge invariant and listed in the classiﬁca-
tion of [9]. This shows that the holographic reconstruction at this order is compatible
with Noether procedure (see Appendix C).

• Although the couplings we obtained are on-shell, in appendix D we employ the

Noether procedure to establish their oﬀ-shell completetion in de Donder gauge.

• The couplings considered here were shown to induce deformations to the gauge trans-
formations and to the gauge algebra compatible with the relevant higher-spin algebras
(see e.g. [11]). It was however not possible so far to determine the relative coeﬃcients
(though some progress has been made in [2, 3, 5, 6]).

4 Holographic reconstruction

It is now straightforward to combine the above bulk results with those for the three-point
functions in the O (N ) model in Section 2. This gives the complete holographic reconstruc-
tion of the cubic couplings for the minimal bosonic higher-spin theory in AdSd+1.
Normalising the two-point functions of the Jsi to one in both the bulk and boundary
computations, we obtain the following coupling constants

The complete bulk cubic coupling thus reads:4

(cid:88)

V =

gs1,s2,s3I 0,0,0

s1,s2,s3 .

(4.2)

The simplest form for the above coupling manifests itself in AdS4, where the spin-dependence
remarkably coincides with the one obtained in [39, 40] from a ﬂat space quartic analysis:5

s1,s2,s3

gs1,s2,s3 =

√

s1+s2+s3

N Γ(s1 + s2 + s3)

.

(4.3)

This is in accordance with the ﬂat limit of the above AdS4 vertices. Notice that the ﬂat
limit requires to ﬁrst ﬁx the spin of the external states and keep the highest derivative term
for each triple of spins. Furthermore, it is a nice consistency check that the above result
reduces to the 0-0-s coupling obtained in [13] for any two pairs of spins si set to zero.

The above result shows how each individual term in the bulk decomposes into conformal
structures upon performing the integral over AdSd+1.

B Radial Reduction

In this appendix we review the recipe to perform the radial reduction of any ambient vertex
of the type used in this letter. We follow the original works [9, 34]. We ﬁrst introduce the
AdSd+1 covariant derivative ∇µ, acting on functions of the intrinsic auxiliary variable ua
as:

(B.1)
µ the AdSd+1 spin-connection and ¯∇µ the standard covariant derivative acting on
with ωab
tensor indices as usual.6 One can then arrive to the following dictionary for the radial
reduction of ambient operators:

µ ua

∂
∂ub ,

∇µ = ¯∇µ + ωab

ˆ∂M
U = ∂M
∇M = ∂M

U − X M
X − 1

X 2 X · ∂U ,
X 2 (X M X · ∂X + U M X · ∂U − U · X∂M

U ) ,

(B.3)

(B.4)

which satisfy the following relations:

[X · ∂U ,∇M ] = 0 ,

[∂U · ∂U ,∇M ] = 0 ,

[∇M , X 2] = 0 ,

X · ∇ = 0 ,

(B.5)

together with

U ,∇N ] = XM
[ ˆ∂M

X 2

ˆ∂N
U ,

(B.6)

While the latter formalism allows us easily to achieve the radial reduction (since we can
keep working directly in the ambient space language), the price to pay is some ordering

6In more details we recall that:

∇µfν = ∂µfν − Γρ

µν fρ ,

µν = − ∂ρ ˆX M ∂µ∂ν ˆXM ,

Above ∆i are the homogeneity degrees of the various ﬁelds and λ is an auxiliary variable
to be replaced at the very end of the recursion procedure as follows:

λn ≡ (−1)n(∆ + d)(∆ + d − 2) . . . (∆ + d − 2n + 2) ,

(B.10)

where ∆ is the total degree of homogeneity of the given term of the vertex. The reason
λ appears is that in order to reduce the vertex to the basis chosen one has to perform
integration by parts. The above recursion relations solve the problem of reducing a generic
ambient vertex in the intrinsic AdSd+1 basis I n1,n2,n3,0,0,0
0,0,0,k1,k2,k3

Some examples giving the radial reduction of the HS couplings found in this letter
can be easily given by implementing the above recursion relations for massless ﬁelds (∆i =
2 − d − si) into a computer program:

Notice that the result is not manifestly cyclic as a consequence of the ordering ambiguity
of the derivatives ∂U . This complicates the computation in the generic case. On the other
hand the above structures are manifestly intrinsic expressions and we have carefully checked
their gauge invariance (see e.g. Appendix C).

C Gauge Invariance and the Vertices Classiﬁcation

It is straightforward to relate the result obtained in this letter to the previous classiﬁcation
of cubic gauge-invariant couplings given in8 [9]. The change of basis must take into account
the fact that the degree of homogeneity was chosen to be

∆s = s − 2 .

(C.1)

This choice simpliﬁed the analysis of the gauge invariance. In the classiﬁcation of [9] one
then arrives to the following list of couplings:

C = eλDK(cid:0)Yi , G(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)G=H1Y1+H2Y2+H3Y3

,

D = (H1∂Y2∂Y3 + H2H3∂Y1∂G + cycl.) + H1H2H3∂2G ,

where G is given by

Above, D is an operator generating a lower derivative tail and λ is deﬁned in (B.10). The K
is an arbitrary function not ﬁxed by gauge invariance and encoding the relative coeﬃcient
of the s3 + 1 (s1 ≥ s2 ≥ s3) gauge invariant couplings for each triplet (s1, s2, s3) of spins.
It is now lengthy but straightforward to rewrite in the above basis (C.2) the vertices
we have obtained in this letter. The end result is quite simple and shows how the holo-
graphically reconstructed vertices (1.11) are indeed gauge-invariant and compatible with
the bulk Noether procedure:

(C.4)

Few remarks are in order:

• Both for 1-1-1 and 2-2-2 cases the Yang-Mills G and Einstein-Hilbert G2 terms are

recovered respectively, supplemented by other higher-derivative terms.

• For any triplet of spins, the quasi-minimal coupling with at most s1 + s2 − s3 (s1 ≥

s2 ≥ s3) derivatives is always generated.

• In the basis (C.2) all the d dependence is reabsorbed into λ and the relative coeﬃcients
of the diﬀerent structures are d-independent and resummed by a simple exponential.

D HS theory couplings in the de Donder gauge

In this appendix we consider the completion of the couplings found in this paper to the
de Donder gauge. This is suﬃcient for perturbative computations at tree level beyond the
cubic order. We work in the formalism of [9–11, 34], which allows a convenient treatment
of gauge invariance and can be easily extended to the de Donder gauge. To this end it is
suﬃcient to recall the ambient space form of the Fronsdal and de Donder operators:

F(Φ) = [(cid:3) − U · ∂X D] Φ(X, U ) ,

D = ∂U · ∂X − 1
2

U · ∂X ∂2
U .

(D.1)

Furthermore, in the de Donder gauge the leftover gauge transformations:

δΦ(X, U ) = U · ∂X E(X, U ) ,

δΦ(cid:48)(X, U ) = 2 ∂U · ∂X E(X, U ) ,

U Φ) .
are constrained by (cid:3)E(X, U ) = 0 on top of the standard tracelessness condition ∂2
0 for the gauge parameter. The gauge parameter is otherwise not divergenceless and as
usual the Fronsdal ﬁeld is constrained to be double-traceless: (∂2
U )2 Φ = 0. Introducing the
point splitting notation:

(D.2)

U E(X, U ) =

(Φ(cid:48) ≡ ∂2

Ai = ∂Ui · ∂Ui ,

Qi = ∂Ui · ∂Xi ,

(D.3)

for the trace and divergence operators, the most general ansatz for a vertex in the de Donder
i ∼ 0. Considering a functional representation for
gauge only involves Ai linearly since A2
the vertex given by CD(Yi,Hi,Ai), the gauge invariance condition reads in the de Donder
gauge as follows:

[Y3∂H2 − Y2∂H3 + λ(Y2∂Y2 − Y3∂Y3 + A2∂A2 − A3∂A3)∂Y1] CD E1Φ2Φ3

Above λ is deﬁned as in (B.10). Given a transverse and traceless vertex CTT, which by
deﬁnition satisﬁes

[Y3∂H2 − Y2∂H3 + λ(Y2∂Y2 − Y3∂Y3)∂Y1] CTT = 0 ,

(D.5)

together with their cyclic analogues, one can check that the general solution to (D.4) is
given by:

CD =

(D.6)

(cid:19)

(cid:18)

for any gauge invariant transverse and traceless coupling CTT. Furthermore, in the ﬂat
limit (λ = 0), the above nicely matches the oﬀ-shell solution in [41, 42] gauge-ﬁxed to the
de Donder gauge.

To summarise, plugging into the above formula the vertices we get from the holographic
reconstruction, we obtain the following de Donder gauge vertices for the minimal HS theory
under consideration:

(cid:18)
e(cid:101)D Y s1
(cid:101)D = λ(cid:0)H1∂Y2∂Y3 − 2H2H3∂Y2∂Y3∂2Y1 + cycl.(cid:1)

Nicley, the vertex involving the trace components of the Fronsdal ﬁelds is obtained from
the TT vertex through the action of a very simple diﬀerential operator.
