Abstract— This paper introduces a theoretical framework
for the analysis and control of
the stochastic susceptible-
infected-removed (SIR) spreading process over a network of
heterogeneous agents. In our analysis, we analyze the exact
networked Markov process describing the SIR model, with-
out resorting to mean-ﬁeld approximations, and introduce a
convex optimization framework to ﬁnd an efﬁcient allocation
of resources to contain the expected number of accumulated
infections over time. Numerical simulations are presented to
illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained results.

I. INTRODUCTION

The analysis of contagion processes in complex networks
is one of the central problems in network science and
engineering, with applications in a wide range of scenarios,
such as epidemiology [1], public health [2], and cyber-
physical systems [3]. During the last decade, we have
witnessed a tremendous advance in this problem, including
the relationship between epidemic thresholds and network
eigenvalues [4], the connection between curing policies and
the cut-width of the graph [5], [6], the use of optimization
tools to contain epidemic outbreaks [7]–[9], as well as new
modeling frameworks for analysis of spreading processes
over multilayer [10]–[12], time-varying [13], and adaptive
networks [14], [15].

Designing strategies to contain epidemics outbreaks in
networks is of great relevance in public health. In this con-
text, the following question is of particular interest: given a
contact network and resources that provide partial protection,
how should one distribute these resources throughout the
networks in a cost-optimal manner to contain the spread?
This question has been addressed in several papers by the
control community (see [1] and references therein). Most
existing results are based on the analysis of the susceptible-
infected-susceptible (SIS) spreading model, in which nodes
in the network can only be in two states: infected or healthy.
However,
in many practical settings, nodes can also be
immune to the disease due to, for example, a previous
exposition to the infectant. The addition of this third state has
a nontrivial effect on the dynamics of the spread, which is
commonly modeled using the susceptible-infected-removed
(SIR) epidemic model [1], in which a node recovers from
the infection with acquired immunity.

Although we ﬁnd a variety of studies on the SIR model
[16]–[21], most of them are based on a mean-ﬁeld approx-
imation, in which one assumes independence of potentially

dependent random variables. One of the consequences of
this approximation is the implicit introduction of terms [19]
which can result in a large approximation error. The main
goal of this paper is to introduce a theoretical framework
for the analysis of the exact networked Markov process
describing the SIR model, without resorting to mean-ﬁeld
approximations, and introduce an optimization framework
to ﬁnd an efﬁcient allocation of resources to contain the
expected number of accumulated infections over time. Our
framework extends to a generalized SIR model where an
infected node can be isolated by authorities (e.g., quarantine)
for the purpose of suppressing an epidemic outbreak. In
this case, we present an alternative optimization framework
to distribute a ﬁnite amount of resources to suppress an
epidemic outbreak.

This paper is organized as follows. After introducing
mathematical preliminaries in Section II, we describe the
networked SIR model (with and without isolated nodes), and
state the resource allocation problems analyzed in this paper.
In Sections III and IV, we introduce a convex optimization
framework to provide solutions for these resource allocation
problems. We illustrate the effectiveness of our results via
numerical simulations in Section V.

A. Mathematical Preliminaries

An undirected graph is a pair G = (V,E ), where V =
{1, . . . ,n} is the set of nodes, and E is the set of edges,
consisting of distinct and unordered pairs {i, j} for i, j ∈ V.
We say that i and j are adjacent if {i, j} ∈ E. The adjacency
matrix A ∈ Rn×n of G is deﬁned as the {0,1}-matrix whose
(i, j) entry is one if and only if i and j are adjacent.
For a positive integer n, deﬁne [n] = {1, . . . ,n}. We let Idn
denote the identity matrix with dimension n and On,m denote
the n× m zero matrix. Let ui denote the ith canonical basis
in Rp and deﬁne Ui j = uiu(cid:62)
j . By 1p we denote the p-vector
whose entries are all one. A real matrix A, or a vector as
its special case, is said to be nonnegative (positive), denoted
by A ≥ 0 (A > 0, respectively), if A is nonnegative (positive,
respectively) entry-wise. We write A ≥ B if A− B ≥ 0. The
notations A > B, A ≤ B, and A < B are then deﬁned in the
obvious way. We denote the Kronecker product of matrices A
and B by A ⊗ B. We say that a square matrix is Hurwitz
stable if all the eigenvalues of the matrix have negative real
parts. Also, we say that a square matrix is Metzler if its
off-diagonal entries are all non-negative.

For the proof of the main results of this paper, we need

the following lemma on Metzler matrices:
Lemma 1.1 ([23, Lemma 1]): For a real number λ , a
Metzler matrix F ∈ Rn×n and nonnegative matrices G ∈ Rn×s

and H ∈ Rr×n, the following statements are equivalent:

• F is Hurwitz stable and −1(cid:62)
• There exists a positive vector v ∈ Rn satisfying the

s ;
r H < 0 and v(cid:62)G < λ 1(cid:62)
s .

inequalities v(cid:62)F + 1(cid:62)

Finally, we recall basic facts about a class of optimization
problems called geometric programs [24]. Let x1, . . ., xm
denote m real positive variables. We say that a real-valued
function f of x = (x1, . . . ,xm) is a monomial function if there
exist c > 0 and a1, . . . ,am ∈ R such that f (x) = cxa1
1 ···xam
m .
Also, we say that f is a posynomial function if it is a sum
of monomial functions of x. Given posynomial functions f0,
. . ., fp and monomial functions g1, . . ., gq, the optimization
problem

i = 1, . . . , p,
j = 1, . . . ,q,
is called a geometric program. It
is known [24] that a
geometric program can be converted into a convex optimiza-
tion problem. We call the constraints in (1) as posynomial
constraints.

II. SIR MODEL OVER COMPLEX NETWORKS

In this section, we ﬁrst give a brief overview of the net-
worked SIR (susceptible-infected-removed) model (see, e.g.,
[1]). We also present an extended version of the networked
SIR model, where the isolation of infected nodes is taken
into account. We also state two resource allocation problems
under study.

A. SIR model

Let G = (V,E ) be an undirected graph of n nodes whose
adjacency matrix equals A. In the networked SIR model,
each node in the graph can be in one out of three states:
susceptible, infected, or removed. For convenience of nota-
tion, we represent the state of node i at time t by the {0,1}-
variables Si(t), Ii(t), and Ri(t) that take value one if and only
if node i is susceptible, infected, or removed, respectively.
Then, the dynamics of the state of the nodes is described by
the following transition probabilities
Pr(Ii(t + h) = 1 | Si(t) = 1) = βi
Pr(Ri(t + h) = 1 | Ii(t) = 1) = δi h + o(h),

(3)
where t ≥ 0 and h > 0 are arbitrary. The constants βi > 0
and δi > 0 are called the infection and recovery rate of
node i, respectively (see Fig. 1 for a schematic picture). The
probability (2) indicates that a node i receives an infection
from each of its infected neighbors with the instantaneous
rate of βi. Also, from the latter probability (3), the time it

Fig. 2. SIR model with infection rates βi, recovery rates δi, and recovery
times Yi

takes for node i to recover from an infection event follows
the exponential distribution of mean 1/δi. We assume that a
node is either susceptible or infected at time t = 0. We remark
that, unlike in the SIS model widely studied in the literature,
we do not allow a transition from the infected or removed
states to the susceptible state, modeling the acquisition of
immunity by nodes to spreading process.

Let σS(t), σI(t), and σR(t) denote the number of suscep-
tible, infected, and removed nodes at time t, respectively.
In this paper, we measure the prevalence of the spreading
process by the quantity

λ = lim
t→∞

E[σR(t)]− σI(0),

which equals the expected number of infections occurring
after time t = 0 because an infected node will be eventually
removed with probability one.

We assume that, for each node i, we can distribute a
preventative resource to alter the value of βi within a given
fi(βi). Similarly
interval [
we assume that we can distribute a corrective resource
δi, ¯δi] ⊂ (0,∞)
for tuning δi within another given interval [
¯
with an associated cost gi(δi). Therefore, the total cost for
achieving the speciﬁc infection rates {β1, . . . ,βn} and the
recovery rates {δ1, . . . ,δn} equals ∑n
i=1( fi(δi) + gi(βi)). It is
also assumed that we know which nodes in the graph are
infected at the initial time t = 0.

Now we can state the ﬁrst problem studied in this paper:
Problem 2.1 (Resource allocation): Given a set of ini-
tially infected nodes, an available budget ¯C > 0, and a desired
control level ¯λ > 0, ﬁnd βi ∈ [
δi, ¯δi] (i ∈ [n])

such that λ ≤ ¯λ and

B. SIR Model with Isolation

The above problem statement is not practical when there
are no medical resource able to tune the recovery rate of
infected patiences. An alternative action in this situation is
to use social distancing, such as quarantine [25]. A typical
question in this context is the following: How fast should
we isolate infected nodes to effectively prevent an epidemic
outbreak?

In what follows, we introduce an extended SIR model
that incorporates the isolation of infected nodes. We assume
that, once a node i becomes infected, the node is removed
(quarantined) according to an stochastic process, which is
independent of the natural recovery process (as depicted in
Fig. 2). Let Xi denote the random variable following the

SIRSIRexponential distribution with mean 1/δ and Yi the time it
takes to remove the node. Then, the overall length of time
from the infection of i to its removal (either by natural
recovery or manual removal) is given by

Zi = min (Xi,Yi) .

(5)
We assume that the distribution of the random variable Yi
is parametrized by positive variables γi = (γi1, . . . ,γiqi), and
that we can tune the distribution by paying a cost hi(γi). We
also assume that, as in Problem 2.1, we can tune the infection
rates βi with a cost gi(βi). We can then formulate the second
problem studied in this paper:

Problem 2.2 (Resource allocation with isolation): Given
a set of initially infected nodes, an available budget ¯C > 0,
βi, ¯βi] and
and a desired control

III. RESOURCE ALLOCATION WITHOUT ISOLATION
This section gives a solution to Problem 2.1. We specif-
ically show that Problem 2.1 is feasible if a set of posyn-
omial constraints is feasible. For this purpose, we present
an n-states linear model
that upper-bounds the averaged
dynamics of the exact SIR model. We notice that, since the
SIR model is a Markov process having 3n states, its direct
analysis is computationally hard, if not possible, even when
the size n of the graph is small.

We start with describing the SIR model by stochastic
differential equations. Let us denote by Nµ a Poisson counter
of rate µ. We assume that all the Poisson counters appearing
in the paper are stochastically independent. Then, from (2)
and (3), the evolution of the nodal states can be exactly
described by the stochastic differential equations:

for i = 1, . . ., n. Using these representations, we can prove
the following proposition:
Proposition 3.1: Deﬁne the n× n diagonal matrices J, B,

and D by

Jii = Si(0), Bii = βi, Dii = δi

for each i ∈ [n]. Let ¯λ > 0 be given. Then, we have λ <
¯λ if there exists a positive v ∈ Rn satisfying the following
inequalities:

v(cid:62)JBA + 1(cid:62)
n D < v(cid:62)D,
v(cid:62)I(0) < ¯λ + σI(0).

and, hence,

E[I(t)] ≤ exp ((JBA− D)t)I(0)

by the comparison principle [26]. Since JBA− D is Hurwitz
stable by (8a) and Lemma 1.1, we can integrate (11) to obtain

Therefore, by Lemma 1.1, we can conclude λ ≤ ¯λ from
the existence of a positive vector v ∈ Rn satisfying (8). This
completes the proof of the proposition.

The inequalities in (8) allow us to achieve an efﬁcient re-
source distribution via checking the feasibility of posynomial
constraints, under the assumption that the cost functions fi
and gi are posynomials for every i ∈ [n]:
Theorem 3.2: Assume that fi and gi are posynomials for
i=1 and {δi}n

the constraints
in (12) are posynomial constraints, provided fi and gi are
posynomials for every i. Moreover, from Proposition 3.1,
we can easily see that the rates βi and δi satisfying the
constraints (12) solve Problem 2.1.

IV. RESOURCE ALLOCATION WITH ISOLATION

This section presents a solution to Problem 2.2. As in the
previous section, we show that Problem 2.2 is feasible if a
set of posynomial constraints is feasible, under the general
assumption that the removal times Yi can be described by
a general class of distributions called phase-type distribu-
tions [27].

We start our presentation by reviewing phase-type distri-
butions [27]. Consider a time-homogeneous Markov process

, w = −Π1p,

in continuous-time with p + 1 (p ≥ 1) states such that
states 1, . . ., p are transient and state p + 1 is absorbing.
The inﬁnitesimal generator of the process, that is, the matrix
of transition rates, is then necessarily of the form

(cid:20)Π w
(cid:21)
positive row-sums. Let (cid:2) φ

0

0

0

where Π ∈ Rp×p is an invertible Metzler matrix with non-

(cid:3) ∈ Rp+1 (φ ∈ Rp) denote the

initial distribution of the Markov process. Then, the time
to absorption into the state p + 1, denoted by (φ ,Π), is
called a phase-type distribution. It is known that the set of
phase-type distributions is dense in the set of positive valued
distributions [27], even when φ = u1. Moreover, there exists
an efﬁcient ﬁtting algorithm to approximate a given arbitrary
distribution by a phase-type distribution [27].

We can now state our assumption on the distribution of
the removal times Yi:
Assumption 4.1: There exists p ≥ 0 such that, for each
i ∈ [n], Yi
follows the phase-type distribution (u1,Πi),
with Πi ∈ Rp×p being parametrized by positive vari-
ables γi = (γi1, . . . ,γiqi).

The rest of this section is devoted to giving a solution to
Problem 2.2. We start with showing that the overall removal
time Zi given in (5) follows a phase-type distribution:
i = Πi − δi Idp. Then Zi follows the
phase-type distribution (u1,Π(cid:48)
i).

Lemma 4.2: Deﬁne Π(cid:48)

Proof: We ﬁrst recall that the cumulative distribu-
tion function of the phase-type distribution (φ ,Π) equals
F(t) = 1 − φ exp(tΠ)1p. We also recall that, given inde-
pendent random variables X1 and X2 having the cumulative
distribution functions F1 and F2, the cumulative distribu-
tion function of the random variable min(X1,X2) equals
1− (1− F1(t))(1− F2(t)). From the above facts, the cumu-
lative distribution function of Zi equals

F(t) = 1−(cid:0)1− (1− e−δit )(cid:1)(cid:0)1− (1− u1 exp(tΠi)1p)(cid:1)
= 1− u1 exp(cid:0)t(Πi − δi Idp)(cid:1)1p,

= 1− e−δitu1 exp(tΠi)1p

which coincides with the cumulative distribution function
of (u1,Π(cid:48)

i), as desired.

From Lemma 4.2 we see that, in our SIR model with
isolations, the infection rates are constants and the overall
removal times Zi follow phase-type distributions. Therefore,
this SIR model has a similar structure with the SIS model
studied in [22], where it is assumed that the infection rates
are constants while the recovery (i.e., the transition from
the infected state to the susceptible state) occurs following
phase-type distributions. Hence, following the same argu-
ment as in [22], we can describe our SIR model with
isolations using stochastic differential equations:

Based on Proposition 4.4, we can derive the following
theorem, which enables us to solve Problem 2.2 by checking
the feasibility of posynomial constraints:
Theorem 4.5: Let DΠi and OΠi denote the diagonal and
off-diagonal parts of Πi, respectively. For all i ∈ {1, . . . ,n},
assume that

1) the entries of wi and OΠi are posynomials in γi;
2) the entries of −DΠi are monomials in γi;
3) the cost functions gi and hi are posynomials in βi

constants such that

Proof:

It is straightforward to see that the conditions
in (20) are all posynomial constraints with respect to vari-
ables v, βi, and γi (i ∈ [n]) under the assumptions stated in
the theorem. Assume that β1, . . ., βn, γ1, . . ., γn satisfy the
constraints (20a) and (20b). Then, by the conditions on the

pair (κi(cid:96),αi(cid:96)) that satisfy (19) and, moreover, minimize the
maximum difference between the left- and right-hand sides
of (19). The details are omitted due to limitations of space.

V. NUMERICAL EXAMPLES

We present numerical examples in this section, for both
the cases without and with isolations (i.e., quarantine). We
let G be the graph of a part of a social network of n = 68
nodes. The adjacency matrix of the graph has the spectral
radius ρ = 10.61. Also, we randomly choose and ﬁx four
initially infected nodes from the graph.
We ﬁrst consider the case without isolations. For each i ∈
δ = 0.05, and
¯

β = 0.00266, ¯βi = ¯β = 0.0133,
¯

βi =

δi =

[n], let

fi(

¯δi = ¯δ = 0.1. We use the cost functions fi(βi) = c1β−1
i + c2
and gi(δi) = c3δi + c4, where the real constants c1 > 0, c2,
δ ) = 1,
c3 > 0, and c4 are chosen in such a way that
¯
fi( ¯δ ) = 0, gi(
β ) = 0, and gi( ¯β ) = 0. We let ¯C = n = 68. To
¯
ﬁnd sub-optimal resource allocations, we minimize ¯λ subject
to the constraints in (12). This optimization problem is a
geometric program because ¯λ is trivially a monomial. The
scatter plot of the costs from the obtained recovery rates and
infection rates is shown in Fig. 3 (red plots). We can observe
an interesting difference of the obtained cost allocation from
the one based on the SIS model [9] (blue plots). In Fig. 4,
we show the scatter plot of the sub-optimal investments on
each node versus degrees of the nodes. Using Monte Carlo
simulation, we ﬁnd that the proposed allocation achieves λ =
2.57, which is 40% less than λ = 4.38 obtained from the
allocation [9] optimized for the SIS model.

We then consider the case with isolations. We model the
isolation times Yi by Erlang distributions with mean γi > 0
and shape p. We let γi be the design variable. Since an Erlang
distribution is a p-sum of independent and identically dis-
tributed exponential distributions, Yi approximates a normal
distribution when p is large. Moreover, Yi is the phase type

the constraints in (20). We show the scatter plot of the sub-
optimal resource allocation in Fig. 5, where we can observe
a similar pattern as Fig. 3.

VI. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we have proposed a convex optimization
framework to contain an epidemic outbreak in the networked
SIR models. We have developed a framework to ﬁnd a
sub-optimal resource allocation to contain the accumulated
number of infections over time. We have then extended
our results to a networked SIR model allowing isolations
(quarantines), where infected nodes can be removed from
the population. We have then illustrated the efﬁciency of
our framework via numerical simulations in a real social
network.
