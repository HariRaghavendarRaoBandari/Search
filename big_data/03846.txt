We study one-way quantum deﬁcit of two-qubit X states systematically from analytical

derivations. An eﬀective approach to compute one-way quantum deﬁcit of two-qubit X states

has been provided. Analytical results are presented as for detailed examples. Moreover, we

demonstrate the decoherence of one-way quantum deﬁcit under phase damping channel.

INTRODUCTION

Quantum entanglement is one of the most distinguishing properties in quantum mechanics,

which gives quantum information processing novel advantages over classical information processing

[1, 2]. Recently, quantum correlations [3] receive much attention because they may play vital roles

in quantum information processing and quantum simulation even without quantum entanglement

[4, 5]. The characterization and quantiﬁcation of quantum correlations have become one of the

signiﬁcant topics in the past decade [3]. One of the quantum correlations is characterized by

quantum discord [6, 7] which is shown to play important roles in quantum information tasks

such as quantum state discrimination [8, 9], remote state preparation [10] and quantum state

merging [11, 12]. There have been many kinds of quantum correlations like measurement-induced

disturbance [13], geometric quantum discord [14, 15], relative entropy of discord [16], continuous-

variable discord [17, 18] etc.. However, analytical computation of these quantum correlations seem

extremely diﬃcult as optimization involved. Few analytical results have been obtained even for

general two-qubit states. An analytical formula of quantum discord for Bell-diagonal states is

provided in [19]. For general two-qubit X states, the analytical formula is still missed [20–24].

Recently, the authors in [25–27] presented a better classiﬁcation in deriving analytical quantum

discord for ﬁve parameters X states.

Among other quantum correlations, the quantum deﬁcit is related to extract work from a

correlated system coupled to a heat bath under nonlocal operations [28], with the work deﬁcit
deﬁned by Wt − Wl, where Wt is the information of the whole system and Wl is the localizable

2

information [29].

It is also equal to the diﬀerence of the mutual information and the classical

deﬁcit [30]. The analytical formula of one-way quantum deﬁcit [28, 29], like quantum discord,

remains unknown. In Ref.[31] the quantum deﬁcit of four-parameter two-qubit X states has been

calculated. Numerical results for ﬁve-parameter X states are presented in Ref.[32]. In this paper,

by using diﬀerent approaches, we systematically compute the one-way quantum deﬁcit for general

two-qubit X states in terms of analytical derivations. Analytical results are presented for classes of

detailed quantum states. Decoherence of one-way quantum deﬁcit under phase damping channels

is calculated too.

II. ONE-WAY QUANTUM DEFICIT OF TWO-QUBIT X STATES

We consider two-qubit states ρAB in Hilbert space H2

A ⊗H2

B. The one-way quantum deﬁcit [33]

is deﬁned according to the minimal increase of entropy after measurement on B,

where the minimum is taken over all measurement operators {Mk} satisfying(cid:80)

k Mk = 1, S(ρ) =
−Trρ log2 ρ is von Neumann entropy. It is equal to the thermal discord [34]. It is also denoted by
the relative entropy to the set of classical-quantum states [29].

Since the quantum correlations between A and B do not change under the local unitary oper-

ations, we consider ρAB in the Bloch representation as

ρAB =

where σi (i = 1, 2, 3) are the Pauli matrices, x, y, t1, t2 and t3 are real number. Equivalently under
the computational bases {|00(cid:105),|01(cid:105),|10(cid:105),|11(cid:105)},

ρAB is called two-qubit X state, in which the parameters satisfy the relations a, b, c, d, e, f ≥ 0,
a + b + c + d = 1, |e|2 ≤ bc and |f|2 ≤ ad.

It is easily veriﬁed that S(ρAB) in (1) is given by S(ρAB) = −(cid:80)±(u± log2 u± + v± log2 v±),

(7)

For arbitrary rank-two two-qubit states, the projective measurements are optimal to minimizes

the von Neumann entropy [35]. They are also almost suﬃcient rank-three and four two-qubit states

[36]. In the following, we focus on projective measurements. Let Mk be the local measurement
operators on subsystem B, Mk = V ΠkV †, with Πk = |k(cid:105)(cid:104)k|, k = 0, 1, and V ∈ U (2) unitary
matrices. Generally V can be expressed as V = tI + i(cid:126)y · (cid:126)σ, where t ∈ R and (cid:126)y = (y1, y2, y3) ∈ R3
1 + y2
satisfy y2
3 + t2 = 1. After measurement the state ρAB is transformed to the ensemble
{ρk, pk} with

2 + y2

and pk = tr(I ⊗ Mk)ρAB(I ⊗ Mk). By tedious calculation [32], we have(cid:80)

(I ⊗ Mk) ρAB (I ⊗ Mk),

of G(θ, ϕ). We observe that G(θ, ϕ) = G(π − θ, ϕ) and G(θ, ϕ) = G(θ, 2π − ϕ). Moreover, G(θ, ϕ)
is symmetric with respect to θ = π/2 and ϕ = π. Therefore, we only need to consider the case of
θ ∈ [0, π/2] and ϕ ∈ [0, π).

The extreme points of G(θ, ϕ) are determined by the ﬁrst partial derivatives of G with respect

with the minimization problem for the case of ϕ = 0. To minimize G(θ, ϕ) becomes to minimize

G(θ, 0) which can be written as G(θ, 0) = −(cid:80)2

The derivative (14) is zero for either sin θ = 0 or Hθ = 0. sin θ = 0 gives an extreme point

θ = θe = 0. While Hθ = 0 has the one obvious solution θe = π/2 and a special solution θs that

depends on the density matrix entries. The optimization problem is then reduced to study the

second derivative of G(θ, 0) with respect to θ evaluated at the critical angles θe = 0, π/2 and θs.

π/2 > 0, then θs takes values in (0, π/2). In this case, the minimum of

G(θs, 0) depends on the state. For given ρAB, θs can be calculated numerically from Hθ = 0.

(2) Otherwise, we have the minimum either G(0, 0) or G(π/2, 0),

(26)

By careful numerical analysis, there is at most one zero point of ﬁrst derivative of G(θ, 0) with

respect to θ, and only when H0 > 0 and H(cid:48)
π/2 > 0, one gets the minimum inside the interval
θs ∈ (0, π/2). Therefore, we can obtain the analytical minimum of G at θ = 0, π/2 or θ = θs. In
the following we present some detailed examples.

Example 1. Consider the class of special X states deﬁned by

ρAB = q|ψ−(cid:105)(cid:104)ψ−| + (1 − q)|00(cid:105)(cid:104)00|,

(27)

where |ψ−(cid:105) = 1√

(|01(cid:105) − |10(cid:105)), q ∈ [0, 1].

Therefore min{G(0, 0), G(π/2, 0)} = 1+L( 1+t

states, the optimization is ontained at t3 = ±t1 or t3 = ±t2 [22]. Therefore, we recovered the result
in Ref.[31] where t = max{|t1|,|t2|,|t3|}.

III. ONE-WAY QUANTUM DEFICIT UNDER DECOHERENCE

A system undergoes environmental noises can be characterized by Kraus operators. We consider

quantum two-qubit systems subjecting to dephasing channels described by the Kraus operators
γ = |1(cid:105)(cid:104)1|, where γ = 1 − e−τ t and τ is phase damping rate
F0 = |0(cid:105)(cid:104)0| +
[37]. Under the channel the ρAB is changed to be

(42)

As an example, taking x = 0.45, y = 0.32, t1 = 0.43, t2 = 0.09 and t3 = 0.15, we can observe

the one-way quantum deﬁcit under phase damping channel, see Fig. (3). It should be emphasized

that the exact boundaries exist between three diﬀerent branches and sudden transitions occur in

the phase damping channel.

IV. SUMMARY

We have provided an eﬀective approach to get analytical results of one-way quantum deﬁcit for

general two-qubit X states. Analytical formulae of one-way quantum deﬁcit have been obtained

0.00.20.40.60.81.00.000.050.100.150.20gD(cid:142)0.240.260.280.300.320.0760.0780.0800.0820.0840.0860.0880.09010

in general for states such that min{G(0, 0), G(π/2, 0)}. It has been shown that only in very few
cases, the conditions H0 > 0 and H(cid:48)
π/2 > 0 are satisﬁed. Even in such special cases, the one-way
quantum deﬁcit can be easily calculated by solving θs from a one-parameter equation. We have

also studied the decoherence of one-way quantum deﬁcit under phase damping channel. As for a

detailed example, it has been shown that the one-way quantum deﬁcit changes gradually phase

damping channel. There is no behavior like sudden death of quantum entanglement.
