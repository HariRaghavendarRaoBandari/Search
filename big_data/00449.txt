(Dated: March 2, 2016)

We present complete analytical and numerical results that demonstrate the anomalous universal
ﬂuctuations of the spin-Hall conductance in chiral materials such as graphene and topological in-
sulators. We investigated both the corresponding ﬂuctuations, the Universal Fractionated and the
Universal Quantized, and also the open channels orbital number crossover between the two regimes.
In particular, we show that the Wigner-Dyson symmetries does not properly describe such conduc-
tances and the preponderant role of the chiral classes on the Dirac quantum dots. The results are
analytical and solve outstanding issues.

Introduction - The electronic transport through diﬀu-
sive and ballistic mesoscopic devices has long been the
subject of many theoretical [1,2] and experimental inves-
tigations [3]. The mesoscopic transport engenders some
peculiar physical features [1,2] with special highlight to
the universal conductance ﬂuctuations (UCF) [4–7]. The
UCFs occur owing to quantum interferences and chaotic
scattering processes, which give rise to the sample-to-
sample ﬂuctuations of charge conductances. It was found
that that in metals and semiconductors the electronic
transport description is accommodated in Wigner-Dyson
universal classes in the framework of Random Matrix
Theory (RMT) [1,8]. The universal classes are charac-
terized by the presence or absence of two fundamental
symmetries of the nature: time-reversal (TRS) and spin-
rotation symmetries (SRS) [8].

However, the control [9] of the novel Dirac materials (as
graphene and topological insulators) introduces new fun-
damental symmetries, as chiral/sublattice/mirror (CHS)
and particlehole symmetries, which became protagonists
of a myriad of interesting quantum eﬀects [10]. Accord-
ingly, novel RMT ensembles emerge, which are known as
Chiral [11] and Atland-Zimbauer [12] universal classes.
The Chiral universal classes can be applied to bipartite
systems as hexagonal and square lattices whose main ex-
amples are graphene structures and topological insula-
tors, respectively. There are three Chiral classes: chiral
circular orthogonal ensemble (chCOE), characterized by
the presence of CHS, TRS and SRS (β = 1), chiral cir-
cular unitary ensemble (CUE), which preserve CHS and
has the TRS broken by external magnetic ﬁeld (β = 2),
and chiral circular symplectic ensemble (chCSE), which
is characterized by the presence of CHS, TRS and has
the SRS broken by a strong spin-orbit interaction (SOI)
(β = 4). Moreover, Atland-Zimbauer universal classes
can be applied to electronic devices in contact with a
superconductor.

With the generation and control of pure spin current
through mesoscopic devices, investigations on its univer-
sal ﬂuctuations became very compelling [13]. Motived by
Ref.[14], which found the survival of the spin-Hall eﬀect

(SHE) in disordered 2D mesoscopic devices, Ren et al.
[15] show numerically, using tight-binding Hamiltonians
models, that diﬀusive mesoscopic samples with strong
SOI exhibit Universal Fractionated Spin-Hall Conduc-
tance Fluctuations (UFSCF). The authors ﬁnd an univer-
sal amplitude given by rms[Gf
sH ] ≈ 0.18 e/4π. In order
to give a explanation in the framework of RMT, Bardar-
son et al.
[16] used a Landauer-B¨uttiker approach and
Wigner-Dyson universal class with strong SOI to obtain
a analytical expression for UFSCF of a chaotic quantum
dot, conﬁrming the result of Ref.[15].

Furthermore, the 2D Dirac material exhibits the fa-
mous quantized spin-Hall eﬀect, which mean that spin-
Hall conduction Gq
sH takes only integers multiples of e/4π
[17,18]. Motivated by this novel feature, Qiao et al. [19]
show numerically, using three tight-binding Hamiltonians
models, that the diﬀusive 2D Dirac samples with and
without strong SOI exhibit Universal Quantized Spin-
Hall Conductance Fluctuations (UQSCF) with an ampli-
tude given by rms[Gq
sH ] = 0.285±0.005 e/4π, which does
not follow the conventional value obtained in Refs.[15,16].
In recent work, Choe and Chang [20] study electronic
transport in 2D Dirac device with strong SOI and CHS
numerically. Nevertheless, their studies were not enough
to reach a deﬁnitive understanding of the behavior in
terms of a UQSCF obtained in Ref.[19]. Thus an under-
standing of UFSC remains open to date.

In this work, we investigate analytically the UQSCF in
a chaotic quantum dot with CHS, also known as chaotic
Dirac quantum dot [21,22], at low temperature. We as-
sume a preserved TRS, SRS broken by a strong SOI
(chCSE), and a mean dwell time of electrons in the quan-
tum dot that is larger than the SOI time, τdwell ≫ τso.
We identiﬁed two regimes: the ﬁrst one, when the CHS
is broken, gives rise to the UFSCF and exhibits an am-
sH ] ≈ √2 × 0.18 e/4π; The second one,
plitude rms[Gf
when CHS is preserved, gives rise to the UQSCF, which
assumes an amplitude rms[Gq
sH ] ≈ 0.283 e/4π. The last
in agreement with the Ref.[19].
Theorical Framework - We consider a multi-terminal
2D device with CHS symmetry where the electrons ﬂow

2

under the inﬂuence of a strong SOI at low tempera-
ture. The 2D device is connected by ideal point contacts
to four independent electronic reservoirs as depicted in
Fig.(1). We use the Landauer-B¨uttiker approach to write
the α-direction spin-resolved current through the termi-
nals as [23]

I α

(1)

The spin-dependent transmission coeﬃcients can be

obtained through τ αα′
i,j = Pm∈i,n∈j |Sm,α;n,α′|2, where
α and α′ are the spin projections in the α = x, y,
or z direction and S is the scattering matrix of or-
der 2 ¯NT × 2 ¯NT . The S-matrix describes the trans-
port of electrons through the chaotic Dirac quantum dot.
The total number of open orbital scattering channels is
i=1 2Ni, where 2Ni is the number of
open channels in ith lead point contact and the factor 2
came from two sublattices of the Dirac Materials [25].

¯NT = 2NT = P4

FIG. 1: A chaotic Dirac quantum dot connected through four
leads to electron reservoirs with spin resolution. The 1 and 2
leads have speciﬁc potentials, V /2 and −V /2, while the 3 and
4 leads have potentials adjusted in a way that prevents the
charge current ﬂowing. Therefore, a charge current between
the 1 and 2 leads induce a spin current between the 3 and 4
leads.

i = I 1

i − I 1

An applied bias voltage V between longitudinal elec-
trodes 1 and 2 gives rise to a longitudinal electronic cur-
rent I and, due to the quantized spin Hall eﬀect, to spin
currents I α
6= 0 at the transversal contacts 3
and 4 with α = x, y, z [24], as depicted in Fig.1. More-
over, we consider the absence of net electric charge cur-
i + I 1
rent at the transverse 3 and 4 leads, i.e, I 0
i = 0.
Therefore, the charge conservation implies I = I 0
1 = −I 0

Using those constraints in Eq.(1), it was shown in Ref.[16]
that the transversal spin currents can be written as

Random Matrix Theory - Our calculation consists in
the obtention of the average and the ﬂuctuation ampli-
tude of transversal spin currents, Eq.(2), for a chaotic
Dirac quantum dot, within the framework of RMT.
Therefore, the spin-dependent transmission coeﬃcient
can be written in an appropriate way thought the fol-
lowing relation

at the Dirac point (null Fermi energy). To obtain the
average of Eq.(4), it is convenient to decompose S as a
function of the U-matrix, which is a symplectic matrix of
order 2 ¯NT × 2 ¯NT , as S = ΣzU †ΣzU, as can be seen in
Ref.[26]. Hence, the Eq.(4) can be rewritten as

Using the method of Ref.[22], developed for the di-
agrammatic integration over chaotic Dirac quantum
dots, we calculate the average and covariance of spin-
dependent transmission coeﬃcient of Eq.(6). Firstly, for
the average of Eq.(6), we obtain

hτ α

.

(7)

The Eq.(7) is quite distinct from the result of Ref.[16],
which studied the UFSCF of a Schr¨odinger (Wigner-
Dyson) chaotic quantum dot. Secondly, following the
same method of Ref.[22], the covariance of Eq.(6) reads

covar[τ α

and prompted us to ﬁnd 11025 diagrams, from which
6300 are non-null. Therefore, the overall result for the
covariance of spin-dependent transmission coeﬃcient in-
volves 6300 terms and the algebraic ﬁnal expression is

cumbersome. Nevertheless, for the relevant conﬁgura-
tion wherein α = β 6= 0 and i = k, the general expression
simpliﬁes to

obtained with the previous spin-dependent transmission

The same expression was obtained in Ref.[16], indicating
that the eﬀective transverse voltage is CHS independent.
Although the transversal spin currents ensemble av-
erage vanishes, the Eq.(10) establishes an eﬀective non-
null transverse voltage. Accordingly, the transversal spin
current J α

ﬂuctuations of J α

relevant for the systems at zero Fermi energy and/or if
there are few open channels in the leads. However, if the
Fermi energies are away from zero and/or if there are
many open channels in the terminals, the Wigner-Dyson
universality classes and the Chiral universality classes
lead presumably to the same results.

We ﬁrst investigate the setup with broken CHS em-
ployed whenever the system has a large number of open
channels or high Fermi energy. For this system, we ﬁx
symmetric terminals, N1 = N3 = N2 = N4 = N , from
the general result with a large number of open channels
N ≫ 1 in Eq.(12), and we obtain var[J α
i ] = 2 × 1/32.
Therefore, the spin current ﬂuctuates universally with
3 ] = 0.25 e2V /h, which can be used to
amplitude rms[I z
write the universal ﬂuctuations of transversal spin con-
ductance as

,

rms[Gf

sH ] ≈

√2 × 0.18

e
4π

.

(13)

In this regime, the universal conductance ﬂuctuations has
amplitude √2 times higher than the result obtained in
Refs.[15,16] for the Wigner-Dyson universality classes.
Furthermore, the result is in agreement with Ref.[19]
when the Fermi energies are |E| > 1 and with the stud-
ies concerning to universal conductance ﬂuctuations in
two-dimensional topological insulators with strong SOI
of Ref.[20].

However, without the CHS symmetry (Wigner-Dyson
ensembles), the universal ﬂuctuations of transversal spin
conductance of a chaotic Dirac quantum dot does not
describe the result obtained in Ref.[19], i.e rms[Gq
sH ] =
(0.285 ± 0.005) e/4π, complied only if the number of

var[J α

i ] =

T − 2NT − 3)

T − 1)(2NT − 3)(2NT − 1)(N1 + N2)

(12)
which is the main result of our work. The Eq.(12) is quite
distinct from the main result of Ref.[16], and reveals the
full diﬀerence between the spintronics of a chaotic Dirac
(CHS) quantum dot and a chaotic Schr¨odinger (Wigner-
Dyson) quantum dot. In the Fig.(2), we plot the average
(9) and variance (12) of transverse spin current J α
for
i
i = 3, 4 and α = x, y, z as a function of both symmetric
open leads, N1 = N2 = N3 = N4 = N , and asymmetric
open leads, N1 = N3 = 2N2 = 2N4 = N .

Using the Eq.(12), we can analyse two relevant regimes
of the chaotic Dirac quantum dots: The ﬁrst one for the
broken CHS, Eq.(5), and the second one when it is pre-
served. In accordance with the Refs.[27,28], the CHS is

channels is very small (quantized). For this reason, we
ﬁx from our general analytical result a small number
of channels in order to preserve the CHS. Using sym-
metric conﬁguration with N1 = N3 = N2 = N4 = 1,
known as high quantum regime, in Eq.(12), we obtain
3 ] ≈ 0.283 e2V /h. The result can be rewritten
rms[I z
in terms of the universal ﬂuctuations of transversal spin
conductance as

rms[Gq

(14)

which is agreement with Ref.[19] if the Fermi energies

ﬂuctuations of transversal spin conductance as a function
of N , which shows the break of CHS as a open channels
crossover from Eq.(14) to Eq.(13).

Importantly, the result of Eq.(14) for the the vari-
ance of transversal spin current is incompatible with the
one of Ref.[16], obtained for the Wigner-Dyson universal
classes. In high quantum regime, the result of Ref.[16]

multiplied for √2 yields √2 × rms[GsH ]wd ≈ 0.292 e/4π,

therefore outside the error bar of the tight-biding simula-
tion of Ref.[19] valid for graphene and another chiral sys-
tems. In the Fig.(3)-down, we depicted the ratio between
universal ﬂuctuations of transversal spin conductances of
the Chiral universal classes and the Wigner-Dyson ones.
Notice the ratio (rms[GsH ]ch/rms[GsH ]wd) tends to √2
as a function of N from the general analytical result.

Numeric Simulation - In order to conﬁrm the analyti-
cal results, Eqs.(9) and (12), we use a numerical simula-
tions from the RMT11.

The massless Dirac Hamiltonian satisfy the following

anti-commutation relation10,11

H = −λzHλz,

λz = (cid:20) 12M

0

0 −12M (cid:21) .

(15)

The H-matrix has dimension 4M × 4M . The anti-
commutation relation, Eq.(15) implies a Hamiltonian
member that can be written as

H = (cid:18) 0 T

T † 0 (cid:19) .

(16)

The quaternionic T -matrix block of the H-matrix has
dimension 2M × 2M . The RMT establishes that the
entries of T -matrix have Gaussian distribution

P (T ) ∝ exp(cid:26)−

2M

λ2 T r(T †T )(cid:27) ,

(17)

where λ = 4M ∆/π is the variance related to the elec-
tronic single-particle level spacing, ∆. The Hamiltonian
model for the scattering matrix can be written as29

S = 1 − 2πiW †(ǫ − H + iπWW †)−1W,

which satify the Eq. (5). The W = (W1, . . . ,W4) ma-

terminals. This deterministic matrix satisﬁes non-direct
process, i.e., the orthogonality condition W †
π δp,q
holds. Accordingly, we consider the relation λzWΣz =
W, indicating the scattering matrix is symmetric (5). We
consider the system on the Dirac point (ǫ = 0), and, to
ensure the chaotic regime and consequently the univer-
sality of the observable, the number of resonances inside
quantum dot is large (M ≫ NT ).
The numerical simulations produce Fig.(2), which
shows symbols obtained through 25 × 103 realizations
compared with the analytical results, the Eqs.(9) and
(12). We use the T matrices, with dimension 800 × 800
(M = 400), and the corresponding H matrices with di-
mension 1600 × 1600 (1600 resonances).
Conclusions - To summarize, we present a complete an-
alytical study of UQSCF of chaotic Dirac quantum dot in
the framework of RMT for the Chiral universal symme-
tries in the absence of magnetic ﬁeld. We show that the
eﬀective transverse voltage is CHS independent, Eq.(10).
Moreover, in the regime of broken CHS the UFSCF ex-
hibit a value rms[Gf
the system with preserved CHS exhibits a UQSCF with

sH ] ≈ √2 × 0.18 e/4π. However,

amplitude rms[Gq
sH ] ≈ 0.283 e/4π, which is in agree-
ment with the numerical simulation of Ref.[19]. We can
conclude that quantized spin-Hall eﬀect in the absence
of magnetic ﬁeld is described by Chiral universal classes
in the framework of RMT. Perspectives of our work in-

clude the study of the Universal Classes of the UQSCF in
the presence of magnetic ﬁeld preserving the particle-hole
symmetry.
