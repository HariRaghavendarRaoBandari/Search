Abstract—We investigate beamforming and artiﬁcial noise
generation at the secondary transmitters to establish secure
transmission in large scale spectrum sharing networks, where
multiple non-colluding eavesdroppers attempt to intercept the
secondary transmission. We develop a comprehensive analytical
framework to accurately assess the secrecy performance under
the primary users’ quality of service constraint. Our aim is
to characterize the impact of beamforming and artiﬁcial noise
generation (BF&AN) on this complex large scale network. We
ﬁrst derive exact expressions for the average secrecy rate and
the secrecy outage probability. We then derive an easy-to-evaluate
asymptotic average secrecy rate and asymptotic secrecy outage
probability when the number of antennas at the secondary
transmitter goes to inﬁnity. Our results show that the equal
power allocation between the useful signal and artiﬁcial noise
is not always the best strategy to achieve maximum average
secrecy rate in large scale spectrum sharing networks. Another
interesting observation is that the advantage of BF&AN over BF
on the average secrecy rate is lost when the aggregate interference
from the primary and secondary transmitters is strong, such that
it overtakes the effect of the generated AN.

I. INTRODUCTION

The sky-rocketing growth of multimedia infotainment ap-
plications and broadband-hungry mobile devices exacerbate
the stringent demand for ultra high data rate and services.
Such urgent demand is further driven by the exponential
growth of smartphones, tablets, machine-to-machine (M2M)
communication devices. To cope with this, unlicensed users
are allowed to transmit on the spectrum reserved for the wire-
less broadband devices as long as the quality of service (QoS)
of the primary network is satisﬁed [2, 3]. These networks are
often referred to as cognitive radio networks (CRNs).

The open and dynamic characteristics of CRNs have lead
to several new classes of security threats and challenges due
to opportunistic utilization of licensed channels [4]. There

exists six major types of attacks at the physical layer of
CRNs, which are commonly known as primary user emulation,
objective function attack, learning attack, spectrum sensing
data falsiﬁcation,
jamming attack, and eavesdropping [5].
Among them, we focus on the eavesdropping attacks targeted
at the secondary users (SUs). In this case, the eavesdroppers
attempt to intercept and overhear the secondary transmission
without transmitting any signals.

Traditional security, which is achieved through the higher
layer cryptographic authentication and identiﬁcation, becomes
expensive and vulnerable to attacks. Particularly, in the emerg-
ing large scale networks with high mobility terminals, the
implementation and management of higher-layer key distri-
bution face increasing challenges [6, 7]. In other words, the
establishment of the secret keys to achieve encrypted trans-
mission in large scale decentralized networks are even more
complicated and expensive than the point-to-point communi-
cations [7]. To cope with these issues, physical layer security
has been proposed as a complementary security method to
protect the conﬁdential information from eavesdropping [8]. A
comprehensive overview of physical layer security in multiuser
wireless networks has been presented in [5].

Recently, physical layer security has been introduced into
large scale wireless networks with randomly located eaves-
droppers [9–11], single antenna legitimate nodes and eaves-
droppers [7], multiple jammers [12], and cellular users [13,
14]. In these works,
the stochastic geometry and random
graphs were applied for modeling these networks [15]. This
mathematical tool is attractive since it captures the topological
randomness of these networks, and provides a simple and
tractable model for characterizing the performance [16].

Various advanced techniques have been developed to en-
hance the secrecy performance [17]. Beamforming (BF) is
proved to be the optimal transmission scheme to achieve the
maximum achievable secrecy rate in multiple input single
output (MISO) systems [18]. Generating artiﬁcial noise (AN)
at the legitimate transmitter is proposed to be an effective
technique to confound the eavesdroppers [19]. In the AN-
based method, the power allocation between the information-
bearing signal and the AN at
the transmitter is critically
important, which reveals the tradeoff between enhancing the
main channel by increasing the power allocated to information-
bearing signal and degrading the eavesdropper’s channel by
allocating more power to the AN. In [20] and [21], the optimal
power allocation strategies were studied in the conventional
wireless network with ﬁxed nodes, and wireless ad hoc net-
works with mobile nodes, respectively. However, all these

works [18–22] have considered the physical layer security in
legacy networks.

Compared with the physical layer security in conventional
networks, there exist several major differences in the security
of CRNs: 1) the QoS requirement of the primary network
needs to be satisﬁed; 2) the SU receiver is subject to the
aggregate interference from the PU transmitters; and 3) the
secondary network is more susceptible to security threats. In
light of the aforementioned circumstances, the research on
enhancing the security at the physical layer of CRNs has
received increasing attentions. In [23–25], the secondary user
acts as a jammer to enhance the secrecy transmission of a
primary network. In [26], multiuser scheduling was proposed
to improve the security level of secondary transmission with
primary QoS constraint. In [27], it was demonstrated that
the best secrecy performance of secondary network can be
achieved when the perfect channel state information (CSI) of
all links are available. In [28], it was proved that beamforming
is the optimal transmission strategy to secure MISO CRN
with the perfect knowledge of all channels. The authors of
[28] then extended their work to the networks with imperfect
knowledge in [29]. In [30], the beamforming and artiﬁcial
noise generation (BF&AN) was adopted at the SU transmitter
to enhance the secrecy throughput of a multiple-input, single-
output, multieavesdropper (MISOME) primary network. Note
that [26–30] only considered ﬁxed location nodes. In [31], the
secrecy capacity of cognitive radio networks with uniformly
distributed secondary transmitters and primary transmitters
was examined. In [32], the secrecy capacity of the primary
network was analyzed in CRNs, where PUs, SUs, and Eves
followed the mutually independent homogeneous Poisson pro-
cess.

Different from the aforementioned works, we treat

the
secrecy performance of large scale spectrum sharing networks
with BF&AN at the SU transmitters. Compared against the
security of non-cognitive radio networks in [21], the prerequi-
site of underlay spectrum sharing networks is to guarantee
the QoS of the primary network. This can be fulﬁlled by
constraining the outage probability at the PU receiver below
a predetermined threshold (i.e., the peak allowable outage
probability). The use of BF&AN at the SU transmitter brings
array gains at the legitimate receiver and disrupts the reception
at the eavesdropper. Although BF&AN has been well treated
in the conventional physical layer security network in [20], no
work has considered BF&AN in large scale spectrum sharing
networks. Therefore, the question of how BF&AN impacts the
security design of such a complex network remains unknown.
Our contributions are summarized as follows:

1) We derive a new exact closed-form expression for the
maximum permissive transmit power at the SU transmit-
ter with BF&AN. We accurately quantify the permissive
transmit power region where the primary network’s QoS
can be guaranteed, as presented in Theorem 1. We
derive the exact expressions for the average secrecy rate
and the secrecy outage probability of the secondary net-
work with BF&AN at the SU transmitters, as presented
in Theorems 2 and 3.

2) We show that there exists an average secrecy rate bound-

ary beyond which the PU receiver’s QoS is violated.
We reveal that the optimal power allocation factor for
maximizing the average secrecy rate varies for different
system parameters. Equal power allocation may not
achieve the near optimal average secrecy rate in large
scale spectrum sharing networks.

3) To provide insights into system design from an imple-
mentation viewpoint, we compare the average secrecy
rate of BF&AN with that of BF. We observe the same
average secrecy rate boundary for BF&AN and BF. The
advantage of BF&AN over BF on the average secrecy
rate is lost, when the aggregate interference from the PU
and SU transmitters is strong, such that it overtakes the
effect of the generated AN.

4) We derive the asymptotic average secrecy rate and the
asymptotic secrecy outage probability of the secondary
network with BF&AN at the SU transmitters when the
number of SU transmit antennas Ns goes to inﬁnity, as
presented in Propositions 1, 2, and 3. Our asymptotic
results well predict the exact performance in the medium
and large Ns regime. We determine the antenna gap,
which showcases the number of additional antennas
required to achieve the same asymptotic average secrecy
rate in more dense networks.

II. SYSTEM AND CHANNEL MODEL

We consider secure communication in an underlay spectrum
sharing network where the SU transmitters communicate with
the corresponding SU receivers under the potential malicious
attempt of multiple eavesdroppers. Each SU transmitter has
Ns antennas, and the remaining nodes in this model are all
single-antenna nodes. As shown in Fig. 1, we have a set of
PU transmitters, SU transmitters, and eavesdroppers locations,
denoted by Φp, Φs and Φe, in which Φp, Φs and Φe follow

independent homogeneous Poisson point processes (HPPPs)
with densities λp, λs and λe, respectively. This model is prac-
tical and representative of the decentralized networks, where
the nodes are randomly deployed or have substantial mobility
[33]. We assume that each PU/SU transmitter communicates
with its unique associated intended PU/SU receiver at a ﬁxed
distance, respectively, in order to simplify the analysis and
provide some design insights [21, 34, 35]. Note that this ﬁxed
distance assumption can be relaxed by taking into account the
probability density distribution of the distance.

The wireless channels are modeled as independent quasi-
static Rayleigh fading. The eavesdroppers interpret the sec-
ondary transmitter’s signal without trying to modify it. In
this complex CRNs, we consider the interference-limited case
where the thermal noise is negligible compared with the
aggregate interference from the other transmitters. Similar as
[20, 21], we utilize the SIR to characterize the performance.
We mask the beamformed broadcast information with the
the SU transmitters to confuse the eavesdroppers.
AN at
Each SU transmitter broadcasts the information-bearing sig-
nals and AN simultaneously. We assume that
the perfect
CSI between each SU transmitter and each SU receiver are
available1. The AN is transmitted in the null space of the
intended SU receiver’s channel, thus imposing no effect on
the secondary channel, whereas degrading the eavesdropper’s
channel. We denote the intended channel vector between
the ith SU transmitter (i ∈ Φs) and the corresponding SU
receiver as hi,si ∈ C1×Ns,
the channel state information
the ith SU transmitter. An
(CSI) of which is known at
is generated at
the ith SU
orthonormal basis of CNs×Ns
transmitter as (cid:2)h†
2, where Gi,si is
a Ns × (Ns − 1) matrix. Note that each column of Gi,si and
i,si.khi,sik are mutually orthogonal. We deﬁne bi as the
h†
information-bearing signal, and nA as the AN. The transmitted
BF&AN symbol vector is modeled as

transmit power per transmission Ps is given by
the total
Ps = PI + PA, where the power allocated to the information
s and the power allocated to the AN is
signal is PI = σ2
n. We also deﬁne µ as the fraction of power
PA = (Ns − 1) σ2
assigned to the information signal, thus PI = µPs .

In the primary network, we assume the typical PU receiver
is located at the origin of the coordinate system, and the
distance between the typical PU transmitter and its associated
PU receiver is rp. According to the Slivnyak’s theorem [36],
adding a probe point to the HPPP at an arbitrary location does
not affect the law of the point process. The received SIR at

In the eavesdropping channel, we consider the most detri-
mental eavesdropper that has the highest SIR for a typical SU
transmitter [37]. Note that eavesdroppers are only interested
in the secondary transmissions, and interpret
the primary
transmissions as interference3. We assume h0,ek ∈ C1×Ns to

III. EXACT SECRECY PERFROMANCE

In this section, we ﬁrst present the SU’s permissive transmit
power region. We then present the exact expressions for the
average secrecy rate and the secrecy outage probability in
large scale spectrum sharing networks with BF&AN at the SU
transmitters. To obtain key insights through a comparison of
BF&AN with BF, we derive exact expressions for the average
secrecy rate and the secrecy outage probability in large scale
spectrum sharing networks with BF at the SU transmitters.

A. Beamforming and Artiﬁcial Noise Generation

1) PUs’ Quality of Service Requirement: According to the
rule of underlay spectrum sharing networks, the concurrent
transmission of PUs and SUs occurs under the prerequisite that
the QoS requirement of the primary transmission is satisﬁed
[38]. As such, we ﬁrst examine the transmit power operating
region at the SU transmitters under the primary network’s
QoS constraint. The QoS of primary network is characterized
that the outage probability should be no larger than the peak
allowable value ρp

out, which is expressed as [39]

out = P r(cid:8)γp,AN

Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) spectrum and broadcast the public service
to households, which do not have any conﬁdential messages.

Proof: See Appendix B.

The following are some observations from (18).
• For the ﬁxed primary network’s QoS constraint, the maxi-
mum permissive transmit power at the SU transmitter can
be relaxed by reducing the distance of the typical PU
transceivers rp, due to the fact that the PU can tolerate
more interference from the SU transmitters.

• With increasing number of SU nodes and PU nodes per
unit area, the transmit power constraint imposed on the
SU transmitter is more severe. This is due to the increas-
ing aggregate interference from the SU transmitters and
the other interfering PU transmitters.

To study the impact of BF&AN on the secrecy performance
within the permissive transmit power region, we consider two
important metrics: the average secrecy rate and the secrecy
outage probability.

2) Average Secrecy Rate: The instantaneous secrecy rate is

deﬁned as [37]

Rse = [log2(cid:0)1 + γs,AN

SIR

(cid:1) − log2(cid:0)1 + γe,AN

where [x]+ = max{x, 0}. Here, γe,AN

the average secrecy rate of
large scale underlay spectrum sharing networks under
the primary network’s QoS constraint ρ{p}
out = 0.15
with the transmit power adaptation scheme. From these
ﬁgures, we see that the exact analytical curves are well
validated by Monte Carlo simulations. The solid lines
represent the operational achievable average secrecy rate
where the primary network’s QoS constraint is always
satisﬁed, i.e., P pri,AN
represent the unachievable average secrecy rate where
the primary network’s QoS constraint is violated, i.e.,

2) Impact of Ns and µ on the average secrecy rate

Fig. 2 plots the average secrecy rate versus the SU’s
transmit power with various number of transmit antennas
Ns at the SU and power allocation factor µ, and we con-
sider the same density for PUs, SUs, and eavesdroppers.
The exact analytical curves are obtained from (27). We
ﬁnd that for ﬁxed µ = 0.4, the average secrecy rate
increases with increasing Ns.

3) Impact of λs and λp on the average secrecy rate

Fig. 3 plots the average secrecy rate versus Ps for
various densities of PUs and SUs. We observe that there
is a shift of the “average secrecy rate wall” to the left
with increasing the density of PUs and SUs. This can be
predicted from (18) that P max
is a decreasing function
of λp and λs. As expected, the average secrecy rate
decreases with increasing the density of SUs and PUs,
due to the increased aggregate interference from the SUs
and the PUs.

and ρ{p}

Fig. 4 plots the average secrecy rate versus µ for
various densities of eavesdroppers λe. Here, we use
the maximum permissive transmit power to transmit the
signal from SU, which is given by (27), and we set
out = 0.1. The triangles represent
Ps = P max
the maximum achievable average secrecy rate. For the
scenarios where the density of eavesdroppers is higher
than the density of SUs, the average secrecy rate ﬁrst in-
creases and then decreases with increasing µ. An optimal
power allocation factor µ∗ exists at which the maximum
average secrecy rate is achieved. For the region µ < µ∗,
we see that increasing the power allocated to the useful

th

signal ensures more message delivery (increasing Csu)
and plays a dominant role in improving the average
secrecy rate; for the region µ > µ∗, reducing the power
allocated to the AN increases CE, and thus degrades the
average secrecy rate. We conclude that a tradeoff exists
between increasing the capacity of secondary channel
and decreasing the capacity of eavesdropping channel.
Interestingly, we see from Fig. 4 that µ∗ varies for
different λe. We ﬁnd that less power should be allocated
to the AN for a network with less dense eavesdroppers.
Out of expectation, the equal power allocation may not
be a good strategy to achieve the maximum average
secrecy rate.

5) Impact of density ratio on the optimal µ

To better illustrate the relationship between the optimal
power allocation factor and the density of SUs and

eavesdroppers. We ﬁrst deﬁne the ratio between λe and
λs as ε = λe/λs. In Fig. 5, we plot µ∗ versus the density
ratio ε. We set Ps = P max
, λs = 10−3 m−2, and
λp = 10−4 m−2. We ﬁnd that 1) The power allocated
to AN should be increased with increasing the density
ratio between the eavesdroppers and the SUs ε to achieve
the optimal average secrecy rate; 2) For extremely low
density ratio ε, all of the power should be allocated
to information signal without injecting AN to achieve
the maximum average secrecy rate. This reveals that
improving the information delivery is more important
than combating the eavesdropping in this scenario.

6) Impact of Ns and α on the secrecy outage probability
Fig. 6 plots the secrecy outage probability versus µ
for various number of antennas at SU transmitter Ns.
The exact analytical curves are obtained from (29),
which are well validated by Monte Carlo simulations.
We assume Ps = P max
. In this setting, we see that
the secrecy outage probability decreases with increasing
µ, and when µ approaches 1, the lowest secrecy outage
probability is achieved. This is because when the density
of eavesdroppers is small compared to that of SU, the
effect of delivering information overtakes the effect of
combating the eavesdropping. As expected, the secrecy
outage probability decreases with increasing Ns, which
is due to the array gains brought by additional antennas.

of our proposed network with BF&AN to that with BF,

IV. LARGE ANTENNA ARRAYS ANALYSIS

In this section, we study the asymptotic secrecy performance
of the large scale spectrum sharing networks where the SU
transmitters are equipped with large antenna arrays. We ex-
amine the asymptotic behavior of the average secrecy rate and
the secrecy outage probability, when the number of antennas
at the SU transmitters goes to inﬁnity.

We ﬁrst present the Lemma 4 based on the law of large

numbers as follows:

network with BF&AN and BF. We see the same permissive
transmit power region for BF&AN and BF in each ﬁgure.
This is because, from the typical PU receiver’s perspective,
both AN and the information signal transmitted from SU are
viewed as interference, which is equivalent to the case of
BF. In both ﬁgures, we notice that the same unachievable
average secrecy rate region located in Ps ∈ (0, 30) dBm with
Pp ∈ (0,−30) dBm. This can be explained by the fact that
the QoS constraint is severely violated in this setting when the
aggregate interference is much higher compared to the useful
signal received at PU.

In contrast to the fact that it is often beneﬁcial to emit AN
on top of the information-bearing signal in the physical layer
security model with ﬁxed nodes [42], we see from Fig. 7(a)
that BF outperforms BF&AN or has the same performance as
BF&AN in all operational region. This is because the strong
aggregate interference from the PUs overtakes the effect of
the AN generated by SU. In this case, more power needs to
be allocated to transmit information signal at SUs to contend
with the interference from PUs. Interestingly, Fig. 7(b) shows
that BF&AN outperforms BF in some regions, owing to the
fact that the effect of AN generated by SU overtakes the
relatively low aggregate interference from PUs. In this case,

However, in our case, there exists singularity at |Xi,si| =
|Xj,s0| = 0, thus the mean and variance of Isec,∞ derived
from the moment generating function diverge [14, 45], which
renders the derivation of the PDF of Isec,∞. Alternatively, we
utilize the Gil-Pelaez theorem [46] to facilitate the derivation
of the asymptotic CDF of SIR at
the typical SU in the
following lemma.

B. Secrecy Outage Probability

We then turn our attention to the asymptotic secrecy outage
probability. We take the derivative of the asymptotic CDF
of SIR at the most detrimental eavesdroppers in (41), and
substitute it with the asymptotic CDF of SIR at the typical SU
in (47) into (28), to yield the general case of the asymptotic
secrecy outage probability in the following proposition.

C. Numerical examples for the asymptotic secrecy perfor-
mance of BF&AN

Fig. 8 plots the asymptotic average secrecy rate of large
scale spectrum sharing networks with BF&AN for various
power allocation factor µ and λs. We assume Ps = P max
.
The analytical results of asymptotic secrecy rate plotted using
(49) are in precise agreement with the simulation points of
asymptotic secrecy rate. It is also shown that the asymptotic
average secrecy rate converges to the exact average secrecy
rate at large Ns.

s

We observe that the average secrecy rate increases with
increasing Ns. This can be indicated by (33) that the received
SIR at the typical SU proportionally increases with µNs. For
the same µ, to achieve the same average secrecy rate, there
exists antenna gaps between the curves with different density
of SU. This antenna gap quantiﬁes how many additional
antennas needed to be employed at the SU transmitter to
achieve the same average secrecy rate when the network
double its density of SU.

Fig. 9 plots the asymptotic secrecy outage probability versus
Ns. The analytical results of asymptotic outage probability
plotted using (51) are in precise agreement with the simulation
points of asymptotic outage probability. Furthermore,
the
asymptotic secrecy outage probability converges to the exact
secrecy outage probability at large Ns. We see that the secrecy
outage probability decreases with increasing Ns, due to the
increase of the array gains at the SU receiver. We also see
that the secrecy outage probability decreases with increasing
µ, which reﬂects that for the scenario with relatively less dense
eavesdroppers, more power should be allocated to transmit
useful information to the SU receiver for the information
delivery enhancement.

V. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we considered secure communication in large
scale spectrum sharing networks in the presence of multiple
non-colluding eavesdroppers. We employed beamforming and
artiﬁcial noise generation (BF&AN) at the SU transmitters to
achieve secure transmission against malicious eavesdroppers.
We obtained an exact expression for the average secrecy rate,
through which we observed the average secrecy rate boundary.
We also derived an exact expression for the secrecy outage
probability. Interestingly, our results show that to achieve the
optimal average secrecy rate, more power should be allocated

SIR is expressed as

of the power should be allocated to information signal without
injecting AN. Moreover, we derived the asymptotic average
secrecy rate and the asymptotic secrecy outage probability as
the number of antennas at the SU transmitters grows large to
showcase the large gain brought to the secrecy performance.
