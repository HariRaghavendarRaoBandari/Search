Single-molecule magnetic tweezers experiments performed in the past few years report a clear
deviation of the eﬀective torsional stiﬀness of DNA from the predictions of the twistable worm-
like chain model. Here we show that this discrepancy can be resolved if a coupling term between
bending and twisting is introduced. Although the existence of such an interaction was predicted
more than two decades ago (Marko and Siggia, Macromol. 27, 981 (1994)), its eﬀect on the static
and dynamical properties of DNA has been largely unexplored. Our analysis yields a twist-bend
coupling constant of G = 50±10 nm. We show that the introduction of twist-bend coupling requires
a re-tuning of the other elastic parameters of DNA, in particular for the intrinsic bending stiﬀness.

The mechanical properties of DNA are of great impor-
tance for both its structure and its functioning within the
cell. In vivo, DNA is able to bend and twist and these me-
chanical deformations inﬂuence its interaction with other
molecules (see e.g. [1]). In order to understand the static
and dynamical properties of DNA and its plethora of in-
teractions, it is important to have an accurate physical
model with the correct parametrization.

The standard model for double-stranded DNA (ds-
DNA) at length scales larger than one helical turn (about
10.5 base pairs) is the twistable worm-like chain (TWLC)
model, which treats the molecule as a continuous and
isotropic elastic rod [2]. The TWLC model features
four elastic parameters, namely the bending stiﬀness A,
the torsional stiﬀness C, the stretch modulus S and
the twist-stretch coupling constant D. For stretching
forces below 10 pN (the range of values considered here)
DNA is practically inextensible, therefore the stretch and
twist-stretch deformations can be neglected. The TWLC
model describes very well many of the dsDNA properties
and ﬁts of the model to experimental data have enabled
precise determination of the elastic parameters. Mea-
surements of the stretching response under an applied
force yield A ≈ 50 nm [3, 4], while studies of the tor-
sional response under an applied twist give C ≈ 110 nm
[5, 6]. Note that the value of C has undergone several
reﬁnements in the past with the initial estimations being
in the range 35 − 90 nm [7].

Despite its successes, there are experimental observa-
tions that the TWLC model fails to account for quanti-
tatively. Notably, a series of single-molecule experiments
has shown that the resistance of dsDNA against a twist
deformation decreases with the applied force [5, 6, 8, 9].
While the TWLC model predicts the right trend qualita-
tively [10], there are signiﬁcant deviations from magnetic
tweezers (MT) data [6]. The aim of this letter is to dis-
cuss the origin of these deviations and propose a solution

FIG. 1. Schematic representation of a typical MT experi-
ment, in which a dsDNA molecule is stretched by a force f and
twisted by an angle θ. The eﬀective torsional stiﬀness, which
expresses its resistance to the twist,
is higher at stronger
forces (a) and lower at weaker ones (b), where twist is par-
tially “absorbed” by bending ﬂuctuations.

to this issue.

Fig. 1 illustrates the setup of a typical MT experiment,
in which the two ends of the molecule are attached to a
solid substrate and a paramagnetic bead. A set of mag-
nets placed above the bead exert a linear force f and/or
torque to it. At forces above f ≈ 5 pN (Fig. 1a) the
DNA molecule is elongated to approximately 90% of its
full length and the response to the twist is basically gov-
erned by the intrinsic torsional stiﬀness constant C. At
lower forces (Fig. 1b), however, the twist imposed on the
bead can be signiﬁcantly “absorbed” by bending ﬂuctu-
ations [10], thus leading to a decrease in the resistance
to a twist deformation. One then measures an eﬀective
torsional stiﬀness Ceﬀ(f ), which is an increasing function
of the applied force f.

This force dependence of the eﬀective torsional stiﬀ-
ness was investigated in the framework of the TWLC

model by Moroz and Nelson [10, 11], who analytically
derived a high force expansion for Ceﬀ(f ). While that
expansion predicts the right trend qualitatively, the ex-
perimental data fall below the analytical predictions at
forces weaker than 2 pN [6, 9], still well within the range
of applicability of the model. Here we show that these
deviations can be explained within the framework of an
extended TWLC model, which was already introduced
by Marko and Siggia more than two decades ago [12]
(from now on we will refer to it as the MS model). This
is a generalization of the standard TWLC model, that
contains two additional features: an anisotropic bending
term, which makes the molecule easier to bend along a
particular direction, and a twist-bend coupling one. The
eﬀect of bending anisotropy on the mechanical behavior
of dsDNA has been studied by several authors in the past
[13–15]. The twist-bend coupling, however, remains to
date largely unexplored. A notable exception is Ref. [16],
in which the experimental structure of dsDNA wrapped
around a histone was analyzed, concluding that the elas-
tic correlations can be explained by a non-zero twist-bend
coupling. Here we show that, by introducing twist-bend
coupling, one can quantitatively reproduce the measured
dependence of Ceﬀ on the applied force.

Following the same approach as in [12], we model DNA
as an inextensible, elastic rod of length L. An orthonor-

mal set of vectors {(cid:98)e1,(cid:98)e2,(cid:98)e3} is associated with every
point along the chain (see Fig. 1). Here(cid:98)e3 is the tangent
to the curve and (cid:98)e1 points from the center of the helix
from the relation (cid:98)e2 = (cid:98)e3 ×(cid:98)e1.

and(cid:98)e2(s) are rotated by an angle of ω0s with respect to
(cid:98)e1(0) and (cid:98)e2(0). Any deformation from this ideal state

where Ωi(s)ds is deﬁned as the deformation angle around

(cid:98)ei(s), i.e. the angle by which the set {(cid:98)e1,(cid:98)e2,(cid:98)e3 } is ro-

tated when going from s to s + ds. As discussed in [12],
the symmetry of dsDNA implies an invariance of its me-
chanical energy with respect to the operation Ω1 → −Ω1.
For small deformations one may expand the energy of the
system around the minimum at Ω = 0 and show that, to
lowest orders, the energy takes the form [12]

FIG. 2. Main frame: Eﬀective torsional stiﬀness Ceﬀ as a

ments from magnetic torque tweezers (green squares) [6] and
freely orbiting magnetic tweezers (red triangles) [9] show a
clear deviation from the TWLC prediction (Eq. (4), shown as
solid line) and computer simulations of the standard TWLC
model (empty circles, with error-bars smaller than the symbol
sizes). Inset: the same data are plotted in rescaled, dimen-
sionless units, in which Eq. (4) becomes a straight line.

A1 and A2 are associated with bending along planes per-

pendicular to(cid:98)e1 and(cid:98)e2, respectively. C is the intrinsic
twist deformation, i.e. a rotation around (cid:98)e3. G is the

torsional stiﬀness and quantiﬁes the energetic cost of a

coupling between twisting (Ω3) and bending (Ω2). Cylin-
drical symmetry would imply A1 = A2 = A (isotropic
bending) and G = 0 (no twist-bend coupling) [12], so
that the Eq. (2) reduces to that of the standard inexten-
sible TWLC model

where we have also used Eq. (1) to rewrite the bending

Computer simulations of the TWLC and the MS mod-
els were performed using a coarse-grained bead-and-
spring polymer similar to that discussed in [17]. Each
bead behaves as a rigid, spherical body, consisting of
a core atom and three small patches at ﬁxed distance

from the core deﬁning the local frame {(cid:98)e1,(cid:98)e2,(cid:98)e3 }. The

two ends of the polymer were attached to an impen-
etrable surface and a large bead, similarly to a typ-
ical MT experiment setup. The equilibrium confor-
mations of the molecule were sampled by means of
a Langevin dynamics integrator (implicit solvent), us-
ing the Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel
Simulator (LAMMPS) [18]. The eﬀective torsional stiﬀ-

which is an asymptotic expansion at large forces.
In
Fig. 2 we plot this expression using the accepted val-
ues A = 50 nm and C = 110 nm [19], together with the
data of two independent MT experimental studies [6, 9].
Although both theory and experiments are in qualitative
agreement, there is a signiﬁcant deviation between the
two at weak forces. Simulation data of the TWLC model
(empty circles in Fig. 2) are in excellent agreement with
Eq. (4). This conﬁrms that higher-order corrections to
this equation can be safely neglected [10] for the range of
forces considered in MT experiments.

We now turn to the analysis of the MS model, which
contains four parameters (Eq. (2)). These should be
tuned so that the known physical properties of dsDNA
are reproduced. For this purpose we have derived analy-
tical expressions for the bending and twisting persistence
lengths of the MS model for a free, relaxed molecule (the
derivation can be found in the supplemental material).
The bending persistence length is given by

By setting ε = G = 0 in these expressions, we recover
the limiting values lb = A and lt = C, i.e. in the TWLC
model the stiﬀness parameters A and C are also the per-
sistence lengths [2]. This is not the case in the MS model,
however, for which Eqs. (5) and (6) imply that lb < A
and lt < C. These equations also reproduce some other
known limiting cases. For instance, upon setting G = 0
one ﬁnds l−1
2 )/2, which has been discussed
in [20, 21], whereas for ε = 0 and small G, one gets
lb ≈ A − G2/2C, a perturbative result reported in [12].
In the simulations we set the intrinsic torsional stiﬀ-
ness at C = 110 nm, i.e. the plateau value of Ceﬀ at high
forces (see Fig. 2). In this regime bending ﬂuctuations
become negligible (Ω1, Ω2 ≈ 0) and the torsional response
is governed by C (see Eq. (2)). Following Ref. [13], we

FIG. 3. Eﬀective torsional stiﬀness as a function of the ap-
plied force in rescaled, dimensionless units (with A0 = 50 nm).
Simulations of the MS model (blue squares) are in excellent
agreement with the experimental data (red triangles, taken
from [9]). We thus conclude that a non-zero twist-bend cou-
pling of G = 50 ± 10 nm (in dotted, blue lines, from top to
bottom, are simulations for G = 40 nm and G = 60 nm.) can
explain reported deviation from the theory (solid line). Note
that a non-zero bending anisotropy alone (G = 0 with black
circles) cannot account for this discrepancy. The errors in the
simulation data are smaller than the size of the points.

choose a representative value ε = 20 nm for the bending
anisotropy. Next we select the values of G and A accord-
ing to Eq. (5), so as to make sure that lb = 50 nm, which
is the measured persistence length of dsDNA [2]. There
is therefore only one parameter, namely G, which can be
freely adjusted.

In Fig. 3 we plot simulation data of the eﬀective tor-
sional stiﬀness versus the square root of the inverse force
in rescaled, dimensionless units. As we compute Ceﬀ from
the ﬂuctuations of the twist angle, we compare our sim-
ulations to freely orbiting MT experiments [9], which are
based on the same principle. A good agreement with the
experimental data (red triangles in Fig. 3) is found for
G = 50 nm (blue squares), which requires A ≈ 76.5 nm
in order to ensure that lb = 50 nm (see Eq.(5)). The
shaded area corresponds to simulations with G within
the range 40 − 60 nm, which covers well the experi-
mental uncertainties. In order to test the eﬀect of pure
anisotropic bending, a set of simulations was performed
with G = 0, ε = 20 nm and A ≈ 57 nm, again keeping
lb = 50 nm. The result is shown with black circles in
Fig. 3 and barely deviates from Eq. (4). This shows that
the bending anisotropy alone has a rather weak eﬀect on
Ceﬀ, as it could have been guessed from Eq. (6), i.e. from
the weak dependence of twisting persistence length on ε,
when G = 0. We thus conclude that, within the frame-
work of the MS model, twist-bend coupling is necessary
in order to reproduce the experimental Ceﬀ data.

Note that the previous estimate G = 25 nm of the
twist-bend coupling constant [16] is substantially lower
than the value found in our simulations. However, in that
study the elastic parameters had not been tuned accord-
ing to Eqs. (5) and (6), hence the resulting persistence
lengths of dsDNA were smaller than the experimentally
established ones.

An alternative explanation for the deviations between
the measured eﬀective torsional stiﬀness and Eq. (4) was
proposed by Schurr [22], who invoked a cooperative tran-
sition between two conformations of the DNA double he-
lix, which have a diﬀerent torsional stiﬀness and rise per
base pair. While this model, too, describes the experi-
mental data [22], there is at the moment no independent
evidence for the proposed conformational transition. In
contrast, the twist-bend coupling naturally arises from
the symmetry of the dsDNA molecule [12] and has been
invoked in past, in order to explain some structural cor-
relation of DNA wrapped around histones [16].

Another interesting property of the MS model is that
the twisting persistence length lt and the intrinsic tor-
sional stiﬀness C are,
in general, diﬀerent (lt < C),
in contrast to the TWLC model for which it is always
lt = C. This may explain the low value of C obtained
from several experimental techniques, such as the ﬂu-
orescence polarization anisotropy (FPA), which probe
the twisting persistence length lt rather than the elas-
tic constant C. Eq. (6), together with the parameters
C = 110 nm, G = 50 nm, ε = 20 and A ≈ 76.5 nm
we used here, yield lt ≈ 65.7 nm, which is close to the
range of measured values from FPA studies (e.g. Ref. [23]
reports 50 nm).

Finally, we discuss the dependence of the elongation z
of DNA, as a function of the applied twist. If the twist an-
gle θ exceeds a critical value, z starts decreasing sharply,
which is a signature of the transition to a supercoiled
state [1]. For smaller values of θ, i.e. when the DNA is
in the normal, elongated state, z decreases weakly with
θ. The origin of this eﬀect is similar to that of Eq. (4),
i.e. the molecule contracts in order to reduce the torsional
stress, by increasing the bending ﬂuctuations. Moroz and
Nelson [10] and Bouchiat and Mezard [24] analyzed this
dependence of z on the twist angle θ, as a function of
applied force, using the TWLC model, which turned out
to ﬁt well the experimental data.

In Fig. 4 we show this dependence, using data from
MT experiments and simulations of both the TWLC and
MS models for three diﬀerent values of the applied force.
The black arrows denote our estimate of the onset of the
supercoiling transition. Simulations show that in the nor-
mal (i.e. non-supercoiled) state both models ﬁt equally
well the experiments. Signiﬁcant diﬀerences are, how-
ever, observed in the supercoiled state, i.e. for larger ap-
plied twist, with the MS model starting deviating from
the experimental data. This region is beyond the limit of
validity of the expansion (2) in small Ω’s and higher-order

FIG. 4. Relative extension z/L of a dsDNA molecule versus
the supercoiling density σ ≡ θ/ω0L, for three diﬀerent forces
(f = 1 pN, f = 0.5 pN and f = 0.1 pN, from top to bot-
tom). We have deﬁned z the elongation of the molecule, L
the contour length and θ the twist angle. The experimental
data from MT (black lines) agree very well with computer
simulations of both the TWLC model (black points) and the
MS one (blue squares) for small values of σ. Beyond a critical
value (black arrows in the top curve) DNA supercoils, leading
to a sharp decrease in the extension. In that region the MS
model agrees less well, probably because the expansion (2)
ceases to be valid at strong, local deformations.

interactions possibly start playing an important role. In
both simulations of Fig. 4, a simple, soft, repulsive poten-
tial between the beads was used. It is, thus, possible that
more complex interactions have to be taken into account,
in order to properly reproduce the supercoiling data.

Summarizing, we have proposed a solution to the
discrepancy [6] between the experimentally determined
eﬀective torsional stiﬀness and the predictions of the
TWLC model. Our simulations show that the experi-
mental data are well-ﬁtted by an extended model, pro-
posed long ago by Marko and Siggia [12], and have high-
lighted the crucial role of the twist-bend coupling. The
introduction of this new coupling constant requires a re-
tuning of the existing elastic parameters of DNA, in order
to keep the experimentally estabished values of the per-
sistence lengths unchanged.

since from these one can compute correlation functions. For instance, bending correlations are given by

Notice that for the standard TWLC model, i.e. for ε = G = 0, these correlation lengths reduce to lb = A and lt = C.
In the MS model, however, the twist-bend coupling and the bending anisotropy will make the rod more ﬂexible, as
lb < A and lt < C.

Finally, let us neglect the twist-bend coupling G = 0 and focus on the eﬀect of the asymmetric bending. In this

case Eq. (40) yields

i.e. the bending persistence length is the harmonic mean of the two bending constants. This is a known result [4,5] for
the worm-like chain with bending anisotropy. Moreover, it follows from Eq. (42) that if G = 0 the twist persistence
length will simply be lt = C, i.e. the same as for the standard TWLC model.

Comparison with simulations

Equations. (40) and (42) are exact in the continuum limit a → 0. Here we compare them with simulation data, as
a means of testing the computer model we employed for the numerical calculations. The simulations are based on a
bead-and-spring model, in which each bead carries three patches. The latter introduce an intrinsic reference frame,
which is used for the calculation of the relative bend and twist between consecutive beads. Our model is a greatly
modiﬁed version of the one discussed in [3], with the addition of twist-bend coupling and bending anisotropy. For the
simulations we are using the LAMMPS molecular dynamics simulation package [18][6].

As a ﬁrst test, we studied the eﬀect of the bending anisotropy and the twist-bend coupling separately. More
speciﬁcally, we ran simulations for G = 0 and measured the dependence of the bending lb and twisting lt persistence
lengths on ε. The results are summarized in Figs. 5a and 5b, where we also compare with the expressions

as predicted by Eqs. (40) and (42).

The output of the simulations, together with these expressions, are plotted in Figs. 5c and 5d. In all cases we observe
a good agreement between the two.

Furthermore, we tested the combined eﬀect of the bending anisotropy and the twist-bend coupling, by keeping one
of the two properties ﬁxed, while varying the magnitude of the other. More speciﬁcally, in Figs. 6a and 6b we show
how lb and lt depend on ε, when setting G = 20 nm. Similarly, in Figs. 6c and 6d we have taken ε = 20 nm and
plotted the G-dependence of the persistence lengths. Again, the agreement between theory and simulations is very
good, even under this extreme “softening” of the rod.

twist-bend coupling constant being ﬁxed at G = 20 nm. In a similar manner, in (c) and (d) we ﬁx the bending anisotropy
constant ε = 20 nm and vary G. In all cases, the agreement between theory and simulations is very good.

[2] In the above calculation we have not dealt with the integration domain of χ very carefully.

[1] A quadratic form in the variable Ωi is a homogeneous polynomial of degree two in those variables. It can be
ij ΩiMijΩj. The quadratic form is said to be positive if
the matrix M has positive eigenvalues. We require positivity in order for the system to be stable. In this case Ωi = 0
corresponds to the minimum value of the form.
In the original
partition function α and γ vary in the domain −π ≤ α ≤ π and −π ≤ γ ≤ π. When changing variables to ψ and χ
the integration domain becomes a square with the sides tilted of 45◦ with respect to the ψ and χ axes. In Eq. (35)
we integrate on −∞ < ψ < ∞ and −π ≤ χ ≤ π. The extension of the integration of ψ to the whole real domain
is justiﬁed by the Gaussian approximation. This is a good approximation except at the two “edges” of the original
integration domain ψ = 0, χ = ±π. In can be shown that the correct calculation produces higher order terms in the
discretization length a, compared to the result of (35).
