In this paper, we mainly study the local indistinguishability of multipartite product states. Firstly,
we follow the method of Z.-C. Zhang et al [Phys. Rev. A 93, 012314(2016)] to give another more
concise set of 2n−1 orthogonal product states in Cm⊗Cn(4 ≤ m ≤ n) which can not be distinguished
by local operations and classical communication(LOCC). Then we use the 3 dimension cubes to
present some product states which give us an intuitive view how to construct locally indistinguishable
product states in tripartite quantum system. At last, we give an explicit construction of locally
indistinguishable orthogonal product states for general multipartite system.

I.

INTRODUCTION

In quantum information theory, the problem that dis-
tinguishing the quantum states using local operations
and classical communication (LOCC) has been exten-
sively studied in the past 20 years, and numerous impor-
tant results have been reported. The local distinguisha-
bility of a given set of states is an important problem
connected with the LOCC. In spite of these considerable
eﬀorts, the local indistinguishability of orthogonal multi-
partite states is still incompletely solved.

Since the problem are considered, the maximally en-
tangled states and the product states are concerned by
most of the researchers. References [1–9] are an incom-
plete list of the results about the local distinguishability
of maximally entangled states. Meanwhile, there are lots
of people consider the local distinguishability of product
states [10–23]. The product states was ﬁrst considered
by Bennett. et al. who presented nine LOCC indistin-
guishable product states in C3 ⊗ C3 [10]. Since then, the
locally indistinguishability of orthogonal product states
in the bipartite system have attracted much attention in
recent years and have many advances[14, 16, 19–23]. But
for the multipartite system, there are a few paper con-
sider the locally indistinguishability of orthogonal prod-
uct states[15, 17, 18]. And in [19, 21] give a full base of
LOCC indistinguishable product states in tripartite sys-
tem. Therefore, the study of LOCC indistinguishability
of multipartite orthogonal product states is still mean-
ingful and interesting.

In this paper, we focus on ﬁnding the locally indis-
tinguishable multipartite orthogonal product states. We
separate it into two cases: the even parties and the odd
parties. For the even case, we ﬁrst construct the bipartite
system, then extend it into the any even parties. For the
odd cases, we ﬁrst solve the tripartite case by consider-
ing the 3 dimensional cubic representation of the states
which give an intuitive view for us to image such states.
Then we combine it with the even cases, we obtain the
results for any odd parties.
We present our results in the following framework: In
sec II, we present 2(n2 + n4 + . . . + n2k − k) + 1 LOCC

indistinguishable orthogonal product states in even party
system Cn1 ⊗ Cn2 ⊗ ··· ⊗ Cn2k . In sec III, we ﬁrst con-
struct 2(n1 + n3)− 3 orthogonal product states in tripar-
tite system Cn1 ⊗ Cn2 ⊗ Cn3 , which cannot be perfectly
distinguished by LOCC. Then we give 2(n1 + n3 + . . . +
n2k+1−k)+1 orthogonal product states which are LOCC
indistinguishable in Cn1 ⊗ Cn2 ⊗ ··· ⊗ Cn2k+1.

II. CONSTRUCTIONS OF EVEN PARTITE

CASE

In Cm ⊗ Cn(3 ≤ m ≤ n), there are 2n − 1
Lemma.
LOCC indistinguishable orthogonal product states[23].

Next, we give another set of product states which
look much more concise than the ones in lemma for
Cm ⊗ Cn(4 ≤ m ≤ n). Moreover, it is helpful for us
to construct the tripartite case. Firstly, we give the con-
crete construction as ﬂlows:

i = 2, 3, . . . , m,

|φ1(cid:105) = (|1(cid:105) + |2(cid:105) + ··· + |m(cid:105))(|1(cid:105) + |2(cid:105) + ··· + |n(cid:105)),
|φi(cid:105) = |i(cid:105)|1 − i(cid:105),
|φm+1(cid:105) = |1 − n(cid:105)|2(cid:105),
|φm+j−1(cid:105) = |1 − (j − 1)(cid:105)|j(cid:105),
|φm+l−1(cid:105) = |1 − 2(cid:105)|l(cid:105),
|φm+n(cid:105) = |m(cid:105)|3 − (m + 1)(cid:105),
|φn+s(cid:105) = |m − 1(cid:105)|s − (s + 1)(cid:105),
|φn+t(cid:105) = |m(cid:105)|t − (t + 1)(cid:105),
2 (cid:99).
s = m + 2k − 1, t = m + 2k, k = 1, 2, . . . ,(cid:98) n−m

l = m + 1, m + 2, . . . , n,

j = 3, 4, . . . , m,

Actually, we can show these states through the graph
more clearly. We show two examples in Fig.1 and Fig.2.
We can see that the states in the left white square are just
as the states constructed in [9, 23]. However, the states
in the right grey rectangle are very simple and concise.
The two red dashed lines constitute a product state.

Now, we show these quantum states are LOCC indis-
tinguishable whose proof are very similar with the proof
of the lemma.
Theorem 1. In Cm ⊗ Cn(4 ≤ m ≤ n), the above 2n −
1 orthogonal product states we constructed are LOCC
indistinguishable.

Proof. The proof are based on the following fact:

if
some set of states are LOCC distinguishable, then some

is denoted by

nMn =

. . .

...



in the basis {|1(cid:105),|2(cid:105), . . . ,|n(cid:105)}B
Similarly we have the postmeasurement states (I ⊗
Mn)|φi(cid:105) are mutually orthogonal. Consider the states
|φm+i(cid:105) and |φm+j(cid:105) (i, j = 1, 2, . . . , m + n − 1), we can
get bij = 0, i (cid:54)= j = 2, 3, . . . , n. And the orthogonality
|φi(cid:105)(i = 2, 3, . . . , m) with |φm+j−1(cid:105)(j = 2, 3, . . . , n), we
have b1j = bji = 0, j = 2, 3, . . . , n. Finally, we consider
the states |φ1(cid:105) and |φi(cid:105)(i = 2, 3, . . . , m, m + n, m + n +
1, . . . , 2n − 1), we get b11 = b22 = ··· = bnn. Then we
have the measurements M†
nMn are proportional to the
identity.
Thus, these 2n − 1 product states are LOCC indistin-

guishable.

To our surprise, the construction of small set of LOCC
indistinguishable product states in even partite cases are
more easy than the odd ones. Hence we ﬁrst present the
even cases.

In Cn1 ⊗ Cn2 ⊗ ··· ⊗ Cn2k−1 ⊗ Cn2k (3 ≤
Theorem 2.
n1 ≤ n2 ≤ ··· ≤ n2k−1 ≤ n2k, k ≥ 2) there exist 2(n2 +
n4 +···+n2k−k)+1 orthogonal product states which are
LOCC indistinguishable. The construction of the 2(n2 +
n4 + ··· + n2k − k) + 1 product states are as follows:
Firstly, we denote the product states from the lemma
by |φis(cid:105)s for the bipartite system Cn2s−1 ⊗ Cn2s , is =
1, 2, . . . , 2n2s − 2, s = 1, 2, . . . , k. Then the multipartite
product states are given by k sets {|φi1(cid:105)1|11(cid:105)2 ···|11(cid:105)k},
{|11(cid:105)1|φi2(cid:105)2|11(cid:105)3 ···|11(cid:105)k}, ··· , {|11(cid:105)1 ···|11(cid:105)k−1|φik(cid:105)k}
where (is = 1, 2 . . . 2n2s − 2) with a stopper

|ik(cid:105) n2k(cid:88)

|jk(cid:105).

|φ(cid:105) =

i1=1

j1=1

ik=1

jk=1

Next, we show these states are LOCC indistinguishable.
Proof : We call Cn2s−1 system the s-th Bob system.
Cn2s system the s-th Alice system. When we consider the
s-th Alice or Bob do the ﬁrst measurement which must
preserve the orthogonality of all the quantum states we
presented. In particularly, it preserves the orthogonality
of the following 2n2s − 1 quantum states.
We use another notation to denote the states
|ψis(cid:105) = |11(cid:105)1 ···|11(cid:105)s−1|φis(cid:105)s|11(cid:105)s+1 ···|11(cid:105)k
(is =
1, 2, . . . , 2n2s − 2) and |ψ2n2s−1(cid:105) = |φ(cid:105), then the state

we obtain

s(cid:104)φj|I ⊗ M A†

s M A

s |φi(cid:105)s = δij.

By the proof of lemma, any measurement which pre-
serve the orthogonality of |φi(cid:105)s and the corresponding

measurement, ie. not all measurement M†M are propor-
tional to the identity and have the orthogonality relations
preserved afterwards making further discrimination pos-
sible.

in the basis {|1(cid:105),|2(cid:105), . . . ,|m(cid:105)}.

Since the postmeasurement states (Mm⊗ I)|φi(cid:105) are or-
thogonal with each other. Then we have (cid:104)φj|M†
mMm ⊗
mMm|i(cid:105) =

aji = 0, (i (cid:54)= j, i, j = 2, 3, . . . , m). In the same way,
consider the orthogonality |φi(cid:105) with |φm+i(cid:105) for i =
3, 4, . . . , m and |φm+1(cid:105) with |φ2(cid:105), we have the a1j = 0, j =
2, 3, . . . , m.

mMm ⊗ I|i(cid:105)|1 − i(cid:105) = (cid:104)j|M†

Consider the states |φ1(cid:105) and |φm+j(cid:105), j = 1, 2, . . . , m,

we get a11 = a22 = ··· = amm. Thus M†

s ∝ Is. Hence, in order to
mula, we deduce that M A†
preserve the orthogonality of the above quantum states
the only measurements of s-th Alice can do is the trivial
measurement.

s M A

Similarly, if we consider the s-th Bob system, we obtain

some cube in three dimension space which is presented
in Fig. 4. Moreover, we give a projection view of this
cubic representation in Fig. 5.

Hence the measurement of the s-th Bob’s system is also
the trivial measurement.

III. CONSTRUCTIONS OF ODD PARTITE

CASE

The odd systems cases are diﬀerent from the even
ones. Firstly, we consider the simplest case: tripartite
system. Then we combine the tripartite case with the
even cases to tackle with the general odd cases. Now,
we consider a concrete example of odd partite.

In C4 ⊗ C5 ⊗ C6, there are 17 orthogonal

product states that are LOCC indistinguishable. Let
|φ1(cid:105) = |1 + 2 + 3 + 4(cid:105)|1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5(cid:105)|1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6(cid:105)

which is called a stopper state. By adding the stopper
state into the set presented in Fig. 3, we obtain a set
with orthogonal product states in C4 ⊗ C5 ⊗ C6. More-
over, Fig. 3 also gives us a sketch proof of the LOCC
indistinguishability of this set.

. Then T = {|φi(cid:105) = |n1(cid:105) ⊗ |ψi(cid:105) |

For the general tripartite system Cn1 ⊗Cn2 ⊗Cn3 (4 ≤
n1 ≤ n2 ≤ n3), the orthogonal product states we want to
construct can be described by two parts: Top surface
part and Right surface part which is denoted by T ,R
respectively.
Top surface part:We denote the 2n3−1 states except
the stopper state in Cn2 ⊗Cn3 constructed from theorem
1 by {|ψi(cid:105)}2n3−2
i =
1, 2, ..., 2n3 − 2}. The number of elements in T is 2n3 − 2.
Moreover, the top view of the states having been chosen
is just the plan of dimension two case.
We notice that there are only three cases of the last
column of the top view: (a) n2 < n3 and n3 − n2 is odd,
(a) n2 < n3 and n3 − n2 is even,(c) n2 = n3. The corre-
sponding views are showed in Fig. 6. Now the top row of
the left view of the right surface also has three cases and
are showed below the corresponding case in that ﬁgure.
Now our aim is to add some states which might imply
that Charles can only make a trivial measurements. In
order to give an uniform description and make it more
intuitive, we should have to permute the base of Bob (we

Similar with the bipartite case, it might be intuitive to
image a product state in tripartite quantum system as

i(cid:48)=1). In case (a),
there is no need to change. That is, i(cid:48) = i for all i(cid:48). In
case (b), we should interchange n2 − 1 and n2. That is,
(n2 − 1)(cid:48) = n2, n(cid:48)
2 = n2 − 1, i(cid:48) = i for the other i(cid:48). In
case (c), we should interchange 2 and n2 − 1. That is,
2(cid:48) = n2 − 1, (n2 − 1)(cid:48) = 2, i(cid:48) = i for the other i(cid:48). Now
we can express the Right surface part more elegant
under the new base of Bob. In fact, under the new base
of Bob, the left view of the right surface of the states we
are going to choose are just similar with the Fig.5 or the
grey part of Fig.1 and 2.

states and the stopper state of the reduced system with-
out Charles. Then the measurement must be the trivial
one.

If Charles applies a measurement that preserves the
orthogonality of Right surface part and the stopper
state. Then his measurement must also be the trivial one.
Hence, none of the three people can apply a nontrivial
measurement.

Solving the tripartite system, we can consider the

general odd partite quantum system.

In Cn1⊗Cn2⊗···⊗Cn2k⊗Cn2k+1(4 ≤ n1 ≤
Theorem 4.
n2 ≤ ··· ≤ n2k+1), there are 2(n1+n3+···+n2k+1−k)+1
product states that are LOCC indistinguishable.
Proof: We give the proof by two steps: construction of
states and proof of its LOCC indistinguishability.

Step 1:construction of states
Let |ψi1(cid:105)1 i1 = 1, 2, . . . , 2(n1 + n3)− 4 denote the prod-
uct states except the stopper states we constructed in
theorem 3 in Cn1 ⊗Cn2 ⊗Cn3. We call the corresponding
system the 1-th Charles 1-th Bob and 1-th Alice system.
Let |ψis(cid:105)s is = 1, 2, . . . , 2n2s+1 − 2 denote the prod-
uct states except the stopper states we constructed in
theorem 1 in Cn2s ⊗ Cn2s+1. We call the corresponding
system the s-th Bob and s-th Alice system for all integer
2 ≤ s ≤ k.
Then the set S of product states in multipartite quan-
tum system we want to construct is the union of the
following sets and a stopper state |ψ(cid:105).
S1 = {|ψi1(cid:105)1|11(cid:105)2 ···|11(cid:105)k
S2 = {|111(cid:105)1|ψi2(cid:105)2|11(cid:105)3 ···|11(cid:105)k

(cid:12)(cid:12) i1 = 1, 2, . . . , 2(n1 + n3) − 4},
(cid:12)(cid:12) i2 = 1, 2, . . . , 2(n5) − 2},
(cid:12)(cid:12) ik = 1, 2, . . . , 2(n2k+1) − 2}.

...

Sk = {|111(cid:105)1 ···|11(cid:105)k−1|ψik(cid:105)k
Here |ψ(cid:105) = |ψ1(cid:105)|ψ2(cid:105) . . .|ψ2k+1(cid:105) where |ψ1(cid:105) = |1(cid:105) + |2(cid:105) +
··· + |n1(cid:105),|ψ2(cid:105) = |1(cid:105) + |2(cid:105) + ··· + |n2(cid:105),··· ,|ψ2k+1(cid:105) =
|1(cid:105) + |2(cid:105) + ··· + |n2k+1(cid:105). Then the number of elements in
the set S is 2(n1 + n3 + ··· + n2k+1 − k) + 1.
Now we need to check the orthogonality of the states in
the set S = S1∪S2∪...∪Sk∪{|ψ(cid:105)}. The orthogonality of
the states in Ss∪{|ψ(cid:105)} is obvious by our construction for
all s = 1, 2, ..., k. So we only need to check that the states
in Si are orthogonal with the states in Sj whenever i (cid:54)= j.
We observe that |111(cid:105)1 is orthogonal with |ψi1(cid:105)1 for all
i1 = 1, 2, . . . , 2(n1 + n3) − 4 and |11(cid:105)s is orthogonal with
|ψis(cid:105)s for all is = 1, 2, ..., 2n2s+1 when 2 ≤ s ≤ k. All
these orthogonality give the orthogonality of the states
between Si and Sj for i (cid:54)= j.

Step 2: proof of its LOCC indistinguishability
If the 1-th Charles apply the ﬁrst measurement, then
his measurement should preserve the orthogonal of the
set of states |ψi1(cid:105)1|11··· 11(cid:105) and the stopper state. An
easy calculation we obtain that it must be trivial one.

If the s-th Alice or Bob apply the ﬁrst measurement,
then his measurement should preserve the orthogonal of
the set of states |11...11(cid:105)|ψis(cid:105)s|11··· 11(cid:105) and the stopper
state. The same reason we obtain that it must be a trivial
one. These complete the proof.

FIG. 6: The cases of the right column of the top view and

the corresponding left view of the right surface part.

Right surface part: R is the union of some horizon

states and some vertical states. The horizon part is H

H = {|i(cid:105)|1(cid:48) − 2(cid:48)(cid:105)|n3(cid:105)(cid:12)(cid:12) 1 ≤ i ≤ n1}.

The vertical part is V .

V = {|i − (i + 1)(cid:105)|(n2 − δ(n1−i))(cid:48)(cid:105)|n3(cid:105)(cid:12)(cid:12)1 ≤ i ≤ n1 − 1}

2 (1 + (−1)i), that is, δi = 0 if i is odd and
where δi = 1
δi = 1 if i is even. Then R = H ∪ V . Then number of
elements in R is 2n1 − 1.
We notice that R ∩ T = {|n1(cid:105)|1(cid:48) − 2(cid:48)(cid:105)|n3(cid:105)}.
Then the set S of orthogonal product
states we
want to construct is adding the stopper state into
R ∩ T .
Then the number of elements in S is
(2n3 − 2) + (2n1 − 1) − 1 + 1, that is, 2(n1 + n3) − 3.
the stopper state is |ψ(cid:105) = |ψ1(cid:105)C|ψ2(cid:105)B|ψ3(cid:105)A
Here,
where |ψ1(cid:105)C = |1(cid:105) + |2(cid:105) + . . . + |n1(cid:105),|ψ2(cid:105)B =
|1(cid:105) + |2(cid:105) + . . . + |n2(cid:105),|ψ3(cid:105)A = |1(cid:105) + |2(cid:105) + . . . + |n3(cid:105).
Theorem 3. In tripartite system Cn1 ⊗ Cn2 ⊗ Cn3 (4 ≤
n1 ≤ n2 ≤ n3), the set S we constructed above are a set
with 2(n1 + n3) − 3 orthogonal product states which is
LOCC indistinguishable.
Sketch of proof: If Alice or Bob applies a measurement
that preserve the orthogonality of Top surface part and
the stopper state. After an easy calculation we may ﬁnd
that it is equivalent with that the corresponding measure-
ment should preserve the orthogonality of the top view

In this paper, we ﬁrst give a concise construction of
LOCC indistinguishable product states in Cm ⊗ Cn(4 ≤
m ≤ n). Then we use the results of the lemma to present
2(n2 + n4 + . . . + n2k − k) + 1 LOCC indistinguishable
orthogonal product states in even parties system Cn1 ⊗
Cn2 ⊗ ··· ⊗ Cn2k (3 ≤ n1 ≤ n2 ≤ ··· ≤ n2k). For the
odd parties system, we ﬁrst consider the simplest case:
tripartite system. We use the 3 dimensional cubes to give
an intuitive view to construct 2(n1 + n3) − 3 orthogonal
product states in tripartite system Cn1⊗Cn2⊗Cn3, which
cannot be perfectly distinguished by LOCC. At last, we
give 2(n1 + n3 + . . . + n2k+1 − k) + 1 orthogonal product
states are LOCC indistinguishable in Cn1 ⊗ Cn2 ⊗ ··· ⊗
Cn2k+1(4 ≤ n1 ≤ n2 ≤ ··· ≤ n2k+1).

UPBs [24–26] in Cn1 ⊗Cn2 ⊗···⊗Cnk is 1+(cid:80)k
bound 1 +(cid:80)2k

If we notice that the simplest lower bound on the size of
i=1(ni−1).
For the even parties cases with the same dimension in
each system, that is, n1 = n2 = ... = n2k = d, the
i=1(ni − 1) is the same as the number
2(n2 + n4 + . . . + n2k − k) + 1 of LOCC indistinguish-
able orthogonal product states we presented in even par-
ties system. However, the lower bound of the the size of
UPBs may not be reached, in which cases the local indis-
tinguishability of product states we presented is diﬀerent
from the local indistinguishability of UPBs. So it is inter-
esting to compare with the two local indistinguishability.
