Introduction

The operation of many micro electromechanical systems (MEMS) relies upon the ac-
tion of electrostatic forces. Many such devices, including pumps, switches or valves,
can be modeled by electrostatically deﬂected elastic membranes. In a typical situa-
tion, a MEMS device consists of an elastic membrane held at a constant voltage and
suspended above a rigid ground plate placed in series with a ﬁxed voltage source.
The voltage diﬀerence causes a deﬂection of the membrane. For a more detailed
description we refer to the book by Pelesko and Bernstein [7].
Taking inertial and viscous forces into account, assuming that the membrane is thin
and using a linear approximation for the elastic energy, which is the analogue of a
linear Hooke’s law, the motion of the membrane is described by a wave equation
with damping and a singular forcing. Rescaling time yields, in the viscous dominated
regime, the equation

γ 2utt + ut − ∆u = −

λ

(1 + u)2 in Ω.

In the regime dominated by inertia the equation is:

utt + αut − ∆u = −

where γ is the “quality factor” and α =

An important nonlinear phenomenon in electrostatically deﬂected membranes is the
so-called “pull-in” instability. For moderate values of the voltage the system is in
the stable operation regime in which the membrane approaches a stable steady state
and remains separate from the ground plate; when the voltage is increased beyond
a critical value, the device is in the touchdown regime: the membrane collapses onto
the ground plate. This phenomenon is known as “touchdown” or “pull-in”.
The critical value of the voltage required for touchdown to occur is termed the pull-in
voltage. The determination of the pull-in voltage is important for the design and
manufacture of MEMS devices.
In most cases it is desirable to achieve the stable
operation regime, except for some devices such as microvalves, for which touchdown
is a desirable property.
Nathanson et al. [6] introduced the ﬁrst model for an electrostatically actuated device,
a millimiter-sized resonant gate transistor was modeled by a mass-spring system.
In this model, the moving structure is a plate attached to a spring. The elastic
properties of the moving plate are described by the restoring force of the spring,

3

which is assumed to be given by Hooke’s law in the linear regime. The voltage
applied to the moving plate results in an electrostatic force acting on the system by
setting it in motion.
The governing equation for the displacement of the moving mass is

m¨x + b ˙x + kx = −

λ

(1 + x)2 ,

(4)

in which the relevant parameter λ is proportional to the square of the applied voltage.
For systems in which damping dominates, we introduce a dimensionless time with
scaling factor k/b, which yields

γ 2¨x + ˙x + x = −

λ

(1 + x)2 ,

(5)

where γ 2 = mk/b2. In this formulation, it is easy to see that if the inertia is not taken
into account, that is, γ = 0, then the static and dynamic critical values coincide.
Indeed, (5) reduces to the ﬁrst order equation

The coincidence of the static and dynamic pull-in values has also been established for
the parabolic equation obtained by setting γ = 0 in (2). See for instance, Flores et
al. [4].
Based on numerical evidence, several authors have reported that the the dynamic
pull-in value is smaller than the static pull-in value, both for the wave equation and
for the mass-spring system. This means that when inertia is taken into account, the

4

moving structure may collapse onto the susbstrate even if there is a stable stationary
solution. Chang and Levine [1] observed this behavior for the conservative wave
equation, which corresponds to α = 0 in (3), Kavallaris et al. [5] in a nonlocal version
of the conservative wave equation and Flores [3] in the damped wave equation (2).

For the mass-spring system, Zhang et al.
[9] described the dynamic pull-in as the
collapse of the moving structure towards the substrate, due to the combined action
of kinetic and potential energies. They also stated that, in general, dynamic pull-
in requires a lower voltage to be triggered compared to the static pull-in
threshold.
The main result in the present work establishes the existence of a dynamic pull-in
value for the mass-spring system.
The equation for systems dominated by inertia is obtained from (4) by introducing a

dimensionless time scaled by the natural frequency of the system ω = qk/m, which

yields (1), with α = 1/γ. See Pelesko and Bernstein [7]. Our results are formulated
for this regime. The existence of the dynamic pull-in value is obtained for all positive
values of α, so that the viscous dominated regime also has this property.
We assume that the motion starts from rest: x(0) = 0 = ˙x(0).

We begin by writing (1) as the ﬁrst order system

˙x = y,

˙y = −[αy + f (x, λ)]

(7)

The stationary solutions of (7) are given by y = 0, f (x, λ) = 0. The structure of the
steady states is obtained from the ﬁrst order equation (6). There are two solutions
(x1(λ), 0) and (x2(λ), 0) for 0 < λ < λ∗, one (with x1(λ) = x2(λ) = −
and none for λ > λ∗.

We now describe the main steps in the proof of the existence of a dynamic pull-

namely λ∗
8, λ∗) there exists a unique
value α∗(λ) of α such that (7) is in the touchdown regime for α < α∗ and it is in the
stable operation regime for α > α∗. This threshold is a continuos, strictly increasing
function of λ, and limλ→λ∗ α∗(λ) = ∞. The dynamic pull-in value λ∗
d(α) is then the
inverse function of α∗(λ). In view of the asymptotic behavior of α∗(λ) as λ → λ∗, the
d(α) = λ∗.
dynamic pull-in value is deﬁned for all α > 0, λ∗
Therefore, our results remain valid in the viscous dominated regime which corresponds
to α large. In the limiting case α = ∞ we obtain the coincidence of the static and

dynamic pull-in values for the ﬁrst order equation mentioned above. A key property in
the analysis is the monotonicity of the stable manifold of (x1(λ), 0), which determines
the domain of attraction of (x2(λ), 0).
We conclude this introduction by mentioning that one of the ﬁndings in Rocha et
[8] is the fact that for an overdamped device, the dynamics in the touchdown
al.
regime has three distinguished regions charachterized by diﬀerent time scales: in the
ﬁrst region the structure moves fast until it gets near the static pull-in distance, then
there is a metastable region of very slow motion and ﬁnally a third region in which
collapse takes place on a fast time scale. We shall see that these regions correspond
to the approach to the unstable stationary solution, which occurs on a fast (order
1) time scale, followed by a slow motion close to the stable manifold of the unstable
steady state until the solution gets away from the stationary point and enters the
region of collapse where the dynamics occurs on a fast time scale again.

2 The conservative case: α = 0.

In this case it is possible to determine explicitly the dynamic pull-in value which
separates the stable operation regime from the touchdown regime.
In the present
situation, the stable operation regime means that the solution is periodic.

When α = 0, (7) becomes a conservative system. The integral curves are determined
explicitly as graphs of functions by means of

y = ±

where E0 is the total energy of an initial condition and F (x, λ) =

For each λ ∈ (0, λ∗), (x1(λ), 0) is a saddle, (x2(λ), 0) is a center surrounded by periodic
orbits and a homoclinic orbit at (x1(λ), 0).
It is clear from the picture in the phase plane that the solution starting at (0, 0)
is periodic if and only if this initial condition is enclosed by the homoclinic.
It is
also clear that this happens if and only if F ((x1(λ), λ) > F (0, 0) = −λ. Using these
observations, we prove

Proposition 1. There exists λd(0) ∈ (0, λ∗) such that the solution starting at (0, 0)
is periodic if and only if λ < λd(0), and it approaches (−1,−∞) for λ > λd(0). In
fact, λd(0) = 1

such that along integral curves,
It follows that the system does not have periodic or homoclinic orbits, and every
solution which is bounded for t ≥ 0 converges to a stationary solution.
We denote by γ(t; α, λ) the solution of (7) with γ(0; α, λ) = (0, 0), and consider
the relevant region of parameters: Ω = {(λ, α) : λ > 0, α ≥ 0}, which is di-
vided into Ω1 = {(λ, α) ∈ Ω : γ(t; α, λ) → (x2(λ), 0) as t → ∞}, Ω2 = {(λ, α) ∈
Ω : γ(t; α, λ) → (x1(λ), 0) as t → ∞}, and Ω3 = {(λ, α) ∈ Ω : γ(t; α, λ) →
(−1,−∞) in ﬁnite time}. The set Ω1 corresponds to the stable operation regime, Ω3
corresponds to the touchdown regime and Ω2 corresponds to the critical behavior.
We shall prove that Ω = ∪3
Our ﬁrst result concerning (7) is the existence of a stable operation regime for each
α > 0. Indeed, we show that Ω1 contains a vertical strip in Ω. We also give an explicit
description of part of the domain of attraction of the stable steady state. The energy

analysis.

Since T depends on the Lipschitz constant of the vector ﬁeld on a ﬁxed domain, we
conclude that (x(t), y(t)) ∈ U for all t > 0. This establishes the positive invariance
of U. Moreover, (0, 0) ∈ U. Therefore, the corresponding integral curve converges to
a stationary solution as t → ∞. In Proposition 1 we established that x1(λ) < − 1

x(t) → x2(λ) as t → ∞. The proof is ﬁnished.
The above result is similar to Theorem 2 of [3] in which the existence of the stable
operation regime is established for the damped wave equation model. Since (0, 0) ∈ U,
it follows that (0,

) × (0,∞) ⊂ Ω1.

The stable operation regime and the touchdown regime do persist under small per-
turbations of the parameters and initial conditions. This implies that Ω1 and Ω3 are
open subsets in Ω. This is the content of the following result.

Proposition 3. Denote by γ(t; α, λ) the integral curve of (7) with γ(0; α, λ) = (0, 0).
Assume that for ﬁxed α0 > 0 and λ0 ∈ (0, 4
27) the corresponding integral curve satisﬁes
either of the following two conditions:
a) γ(t; α0, λ0) → (x2(λ0), 0) as t → ∞
b) γ(t; α0, λ0) → (−1,−∞) in ﬁnite time
Then the same is true for all nearby values of α and λ.
Proof

a) Since (x2(λ0), 0) is a hyperbolic sink, Taylor’s theorem guarantees the existence of
δ(λ0) > 0 such that on the circle centered at this ﬁxed point and radius δ, the vector
ﬁeld deﬁned by (7) points inside the corresponding disk. By continuous dependence
on parameters, the same is true for all values of α and λ suﬃciently close to α0 and
λ0 respectively. For such values of α and λ, the corresponding integral curve γ(t; α, λ)
enters the invariant disk at some positive time and it remains there for all later times.
It follows that the integral curve must approach (x2(λ), 0), provided we restrict δ
further if necessary, to make sure that the saddles (x1(λ), 0) lie outside the invariant
disk.
b) Since for any positive values of α and λ we have ¨x(0; α, λ) = ˙y(0; α, λ)) = −λ, the
integral curve starting at the origin enters the third quadrant immediately and ˙y(t) <
0 for suﬃciently small positive values of t. At some t1 > 0 we must have ˙y(t1) = 0
and the integral curve enters the region ˙y(t) > 0 immediately. By the hypothesis,
the integral curve cannot remain in this region for all t > t1. Therefore, there exists
t2 > t1 such that γ(t2; α0, λ0) is in the invariant region deﬁned by −1 < x < x1(λ0),
y < 0 and ˙y = −[α0y + f (x, λ0)] < 0. By the continuity of solutions with respect to
parameters, the same will be true for all nearby values of α and λ. On each of the
invariant regions corresponding to such values of α and λ we have x(t) → −1 and
y(t) → −∞ in ﬁnite time. The proof is ﬁnished.
The argument in (b) above allows us to show that γ(t; α, λ) either converges to a

9

stationary solution or else it approaches (−1,−∞).

j=1Ωj.

Proposition 4. For any (α, λ) ∈ Ω, either γ(t; α, λ) → (xj(λ), 0) as t → ∞ for j = 1
or 2, or else γ(t; α, λ) → (−1,∞) in ﬁnite time. In other words, Ω = ∪3
Proof. If γ(t; α, λ) is bounded, then it is deﬁned for all t > 0 and has a non-empty
ω-limit set, which consists of stationary solutions. Since this set is ﬁnite, γ(t; α, λ)
converges to a stationary solution as t → ∞.
To analyze the other case, assume that γ(t; α, λ) is unbounded. The ﬁrst observation
is that the integral curve does not cross the line x = 0 for positive times, since
y2
E(0, y) =
2 − λ > −λ = E(0, 0) for y 6= 0. Therefore, −1 < x(t; α, λ) < 0 for t > 0
as long as the solution is deﬁned. It follows that the y component is unbounded. Since
it is bounded above by the maximum of −f (x, λ), it follows that the y component
must approach −∞ through a sequence of times tn → ∞. This is possible only in
the invariant region −1 < x < 0, y < 0 and ˙y < 0, where, as we have seen in part (b)
of the previous result, x(t) → −1 and y(t) → −∞ in ﬁnite time.

Remark A consequence of Proposition 4 is that (α, λ) ∈ Ω3 for any α ≥ 0 and all
λ > λ∗, since in this case there are no stationary solutions.

Our next result is part of the description of the phase portrait of (7), in which the
invariant manifolds of the stationary solutions play a fundamental role. We prove the

existence of a heteroclinic orbit from (x1(λ), 0) to (x2(λ), 0) for α > 2qs(λ), where
(1 + x)3 is an increasing function of x, it
. Hence, there is a heteroclinic orbit for every value

of α for which (x2(λ), 0) is a stable node. The nonlinearity in the equation is of the
type of Fisher’s equation, which explains the existence of the saddle-node connections
for the stated values of α.

Proposition 5. For each α > 2qs(λ), system (7) has a heteroclinic connection from

(x1(λ), 0) to (x2(λ), 0).
Proof. We consider the triangular region deﬁned by the line x = x1(λ), with y > 0,
the segment [x1(λ), x2(λ)], with y = 0 and a line segment y = m(x − x2(λ)) with
x1(λ) ≤ x ≤ x2(λ), and m < 0. It is clear that on the horizontal and vertical sides of
the triangle, the vector ﬁeld deﬁned by (7) points inward the triangular region. We
shall determine negative values of m for which the vector ﬁeld also points inwards on
the third side. Choosing N = (−m, 1) as a normal vector for the slanted side of the

10

triangle, and denoting by V the vector ﬁeld deﬁned by (7), the condition on m so
that the vector ﬁeld points inwards is < N, V >< 0. Since

< N, V >= −[x − x2(λ)]{m2 + αm +

it follows that < N, V >≤ −[x − x2(λ)][m2 + αm + s(λ)]. The quadratic polynomial

in m has roots m± = − α
Therefore, there are negative values of m for which the quadratic takes negative
values. This completes the construction of an invariant region. The branch of the
unstable manifold of (x1(λ), 0) that points into the region y > 0, x > x1(λ) enters this
invariant region and never leaves it. Therefore, it converges to (x2(λ), 0) as t → ∞.
The proof is ﬁnished.

The next result establishes the monotonocity of the integral curve starting at (0, 0)
as a function of λ, as well as a criterion for touchdown.

Proposition 6. Fix α > 0, let γ(t; α, λ) = (x(t; α, λ), y(t; α, λ), then y(t; α, λ)) is a
decreasing function of λ as long as y(t; α, λ) < 0. Moreover, (α, λ) ∈ Ω3 if there exists
λ0 < λ such that (α, λ0) ∈ Ω2 ∪ Ω3.
Proof. Take 0 < λ1 < λ2, and let yj(t; α) := y(t; α, λj). Then yj(0; α) = 0 and
˙yj(0; α) = −λj. It follows that y2(t; α) < y1(t; α) for t > 0 and small.
Note that the second component of the vector ﬁeld in (7) is monotonic in λ because
∂f (x, λ)
1 + x2 > 0. This implies that the inequality above is valid as long as
each yj is negative. This means that the integral curves do not cross as long as they
remain in the third quadrant.
For the second part of the statement, the conclusion follows immediately from the
monotonicity if (α, λ0) ∈ Ω3.
In the other case, (α, λ0) ∈ Ω2, the integral curve
starting at (0, 0) approaches (x1(λ0), 0) as t → ∞. Since x1(λ) is increasing in λ and
x2(λ) is decreasing, the monotonicity of the integral curves guarantee that γ(t; α, λ)
cannot approach either of the critical points. Hence it has to approach (−1,−∞) and
the integral curve has a ﬁnite time of existence since the y component is eventually
decreasing. The proof is ﬁnished.

The stable manifold of the saddle (x1(λ), 0) plays a crucial role in the determination
of the dynamic pull-in value. The domain of attraction of (x2(λ), 0) is determined
by the connected component of the stable manifold of (x1(λ), 0) that approaches this
saddle from the third quadrant. It is more convenient to analyze the behavior of the
stable manifold by ﬁxing λ and varying α.

8, 4

We prove that for each λ ∈ (0, 4
27), the connected component of the stable manifold
described above is a strictly monotonic function of α. The point of intersection with
the horizontal axis is a monotonic and continuous function of α. We shall consider
λ ∈ ( 1
27 ). We shall prove that for small values of α, the stable manifold crosses
the negative x-axis, which corresponds to touchdown because the solution starting at
(0, 0) cannot approach (x2(λ), 0). For large values of α, the stable manifold crosses
the positive x-axis. In this case, the solution (x(t), y(t)) is bounded for t ≥ 0 and it
converges to (x2(λ), 0) as t → ∞.
It follows that there is a unique value α∗(λ) of α such that the stable manifold crosses
the x- axis at x = 0. We also prove that α∗(λ) is a continuous and strictly increasing
function of λ. The dynamic pull-in value λ∗
d(α) is the inverse function of α∗(λ). The
dynamic pull-in value is deﬁned for all(?) positive values of α.

For convenience, we change t by −t, y by −y, and rewrite (7) in terms of u = x−x1(λ)
and v = y, obtaining

The branch of the local unstable manifold that points into the ﬁrst quadrant is the
graph of a continuous function v = Φ(u; λ, α) and it can be continued as a graph as

Our next result is the monotonicity of Φ with respect to α.

Proposition 7. For ﬁxed λ > 0, Φ(u; α, λ) is an strictly increasing function of α.
Proof. Fix λ > 0, take 0 < α1 < α2 and denote Φ(u; αj, λ) by Φj(u) for j = 1, 2.
Since µ+ is an strictly increasing function of α, it follows that Φ1(u) < Φ2(u) for
small positive values of u. It is clear from (14) that the graph of Φ1 cannot intersect
the graph of Φ2 as long as they are deﬁned. The proof is ﬁnished.

For ﬁxed λ ∈ ( 1

27) , let

I(λ) := {α ≥ 0 : there exists ¯u(α) > 0 with Φ(¯u(α); α, λ) = 0}

12

and J(λ) := {¯u(α) : α ∈ I(λ)}.
A crucial step in the proof of the existence of the dynamic pull-in value is the de-
termination of the set J(λ). To do this, it is convenient to analyze the intersec-
tion of the unstable manifolds with the vertical line L in the phase plane given by
u = x2(λ) − x1(λ). By the monotonicity of the unstable manifolds and the transver-
sality of L with respect to the vector ﬁeld in (12), the set

K(λ) := {(x2(λ) − x1(λ), Φ(x2(λ) − x1(λ); α, λ) : α ≥ 0}

deﬁnes an interval on the line L, since the points of intersection deﬁne a continuous
function of α. See Conley [2].

Let v0 := Φ(x2(λ)− x1(λ); 0, λ) denote the height of the homoclinic orbit correspond-
ing to α = 0 at u = x2(λ) − x1(λ). Our next result determines the set K(λ).

Lemma 1. K(λ) = {x2(λ) − x1(λ)} × [v0,∞).
dΦ
Proof. Since f (u + x1(λ), λ) < 0, it follows from (14) that
du ≥ α for every α > 0
and u ∈ [0, x2(λ) − x1(λ)]. On this interval we have Φ(u; α, λ) ≥ αu. In particular
Φ(x2(λ) − x1(λ); α, λ) ≥ α[x2(λ) − x1(λ)]. The proof is ﬁnished.

Remark. The above estimate for Φ suggests that the critical value of α tends to ∞
as λ approaches λ∗.

Lemma 2. I(λ) and J(λ) are non-empty intervals. Moreover, I(λ) = [0, ¯α(λ)) with
¯α(λ) := sup I(λ), and ¯u(λ) := sup J(λ) = ∞, so that J(λ) = [¯u(0),∞).
Proof. In Section 2 we veriﬁed that 0 ∈ I(λ). The monotonicity and the continuity
of Φ with respect to α guarantee that I(λ) and J(λ) are intervals.
We claim that I(λ) = [0, ¯α(λ)). This is clear if ¯α(λ) = ∞. Now assume that
the supremum is ﬁnite and that it belongs to the set I(λ), then ¯u(λ) < ∞ and
Φ(¯u(λ); ¯α(λ), λ) = 0. Take ε > 0, then, by the continuity and monotonicity of Φ with
respect to α, the set

{(x2(λ) − x1(λ), Φ(x2(λ) − x1(λ); α, λ) : α ∈ [0, ¯α(λ) + ε]}

describes a closed interval on the line L in the phase plane. Moreover, the integral
curve starting at (¯u( ¯α(λ)), 0) immediately enters the region v < 0. By continuity
with respect to initial conditions, the same is true for values of α ∈ ( ¯α(λ), ¯α(λ) + ε)
for ε suﬃciently small. This contradicts the deﬁnition of ¯u(λ) as the supremum of
J(λ) and establishes the claim.

13

The next task is to verify that ¯u(λ) = ∞. We distinguish two cases, according to
whether ¯α(λ) is ﬁnite or inﬁnity.
In the ﬁrst case, ¯α(λ) < ∞, assume that ¯u(λ) < ∞. From (14) we see that Φ
has a ﬁnite derivative on every ﬁnite interval on which it is deﬁned. Using this
fact and the continuous dependence on α we conclude that Φ(u; ¯α(λ), λ) > 0 for all
u > 0. By continuous dependence on initial conditions we get unstable manifolds for
¯α(λ) − ε < α < ¯α(λ) with ε small enough, for which Φ > 0 for u > ¯u(λ). This is
a contradiction since Φ(¯u(α); α, λ) = 0 for 0 ≤ α < ¯α(λ). This contradiction proves
that ¯u(λ) = ∞ if ¯α(λ) < ∞.
In the case ¯α(λ) = ∞ we have that ¯u(α) is deﬁned for all α > 0 and Φ(¯u(α); α, λ) = 0.
The point of intersection of the graph of Φ with the line L lies in the region where
˙v > 0. In the case under consideration, the graph of Φ must leave this region at a
point with ﬁrst component u satisfying u > h(α[x2(λ) − x1(λ)], λ), where h is the
inverse function of f on the interval (x2(λ) − x1(λ),∞). Since f is increasing and
tends to ∞ as u approaches ∞, we get ¯u(α) > h(α[x2(λ)−x1(λ)], λ) → ∞ as α → ∞.
The proof is ﬁnished.

8, 4

For the values of λ under consideration, the next result establishes the existence
of a critical value α∗(λ) such that the touchdown regime corresponds to (0, α∗(λ)),
while the stable operation corresponds to (α∗(λ),∞). The critical value occurs when
¯u(α) = −x1(λ).
Theorem. For each λ ∈ ( 1
27) there exists α∗(λ) > 0 such that the touch-
down regime corresponds to (0, α∗(λ)), while the stable operation corresponds to
(α∗(λ),∞). Moreover, α∗(λ) is an strictly increasing, continuous function of λ, and
α∗(λ) → ∞ as λ → 4
27 .
Proof. The critical value α∗(λ) is the value of α for which ¯u(α) = −x1(λ).
It is
well deﬁned by Lemma 2. The monotonicity is a consequence of Proposition 7. To
verify the stated properties, we return to the original equation (7). In this setting,
the critical value satisﬁes ¯x(α∗(λ)) = 0.
The content of Lemma 2 is that for α < ¯α(λ), the branch of the stable manifold of the
saddle (x1(λ), 0) that enters from the third quadrant intersects the horizontal axis at
(¯x(α), 0) and the points of intersection comprise the interval [¯u(0),∞), or equivalently,
the interval [¯x(0)−x1(λ),∞) where ¯u(0) < −x1(λ), or equivalently ¯x(0) < 0. The left
end-point of the interval is thus determined by the homoclinic orbit in the conservative
case α = 0. By the monotonicity and continuity of the points of intersection, there
exists a unique value α∗ of α such that the point of intersection satisﬁes ¯x(α∗) = 0.

14

For α < α∗, the point of intersection satisﬁes ¯x(α) < 0. In this case, it is clear that
(0, 0) is not in the domain of attraction of (x2(λ), 0). It follows that the integral curve
starting at (0, 0), which enters the third quadrant immediately, in fact, it enters the
region where y < 0 and ˙y < 0. Since integral curves in this region cannot approach
the point (x2(λ), 0), it follows that there exists T1 > 0 such that ˙y(T1) = 0 and the
integral curve enters immediately the region where ˙y > 0. But, it cannot remain
there for all t ≥ T1 since it cannot cross the stable manifold. It follows that there
exists T2 > T1 such that ˙y(T2) = 0. Now the integral curves enters the region where
−1 < x < x1(λ), y < 0 and ˙y < 0. As it was established in Proposition 4, solutions
in this positively invariant region satisfy x(t) = −1 is achieved in ﬁnite time.
In the case α > α∗, the point of intersection satisﬁes ¯x(α) > 0. The stable manifold
provides a lower bound on the second component of the integral curve starting at
(0, 0). The graph v = − 1
α f (x, λ) on the interval [x1(λ), x2(λ)] provides the upper
bound. Hence, the integral curve converges to (x2(λ), 0) as t → ∞.
For the continuity, take λ0 in the interval under consideration, and 0 < ε < α∗(λ0),
then γ(t; α∗(λ0) − ε, λ0) → (−1,−∞) and γ(t; α∗(λ0) + ε, λ0) → (x2(λ), 0). By
Proposition 3, there exists δ > 0 such that the above properties are mantained if
|λ − λ0| < δ. Now we use the continuity and monotonicity of the unstable manifolds
to conclude that for such values of λ we have α∗(λ0) − ε < α∗(λ) < α∗(λ0) + ε, which
establishes the continuity of the critical value α∗(λ)
The last step is the asymptotic behavior of α∗(λ) as λ → λ∗. The proof is by
contradiction. Assume that for λ = λ∗ =
, there exists a positive real number α0
such that if γ(t; α) is the solution of (12) for λ = λ∗ with γ(0; α) = (0, 0), except that
we keep the variables (x, y), then γ(t; α0) → (−
, 0) as t → ∞. In this case, (α, λ)
is in the stable operation regime for all α > α0 and 0 < λ < λ∗. Since (α, λ) is in
the touchdown regime for all α > 0 and λ > λ∗, it follows that γ(t; α) → (−
, 0) as
t → ∞ for all α > α0. Now we have a one-parameter family of unstable manifolds of
(− 1
3, 0) with a branch that points into the second quadrant and such that their ﬁrst
crossing with the line y = 0 occurs at x = 0. Each of these branches of the unstable
manifolds is the graph of a function y = Φ(x; α) deﬁned for − 1
3 ≤ x ≤ 0. Moreover,
dΦ
, α) = µ+ = α. An argument similar
dx
to the one used in Proposition 7 for 0 < λ < λ∗ shows that Φ is an increasing function
of α for − 1
3 ≤ x ≤ 0. Now let (x0, y0) be the point of intersection of the branch of
the unstable manifold with the graph of y = f (x, λ∗), then y0 = Φ(x0, α0). Since
Φ is an increasing function of x ∈ (− 1
