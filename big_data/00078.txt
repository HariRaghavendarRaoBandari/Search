THE ABELL 85 BCG: A NUCLEATED, CORE-LESS GALAXY

Juan P. Madrid1,2 and Carlos J. Donzelli3

ApJ accepted

ABSTRACT

New high-resolution r band imaging of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) in Abell 85 (Holm 15A)
was obtained using the Gemini Multi Object Spectrograph. These data were taken with the aim
of deriving an accurate surface brightness proﬁle of the BCG of Abell 85, in particular its central
region. The new Gemini data show clear evidence of a previously unreported nuclear emission that
is evident as a distinct light excess in the central kiloparsec of the surface brightness proﬁle. We
ﬁnd that the light proﬁle is never ﬂat nor does it present a downward trend towards the center of the
galaxy. That is, the new Gemini data show a diﬀerent physical reality from the featureless, “evacuated
core” recently claimed for the Abell 85 BCG. After trying diﬀerent models, we ﬁnd that the surface
brightness proﬁle of the BCG of Abell 85 is best ﬁt by a double S´ersic model.

1. INTRODUCTION

Within the current framework of hierarchical structure
formation (e.g. White & Rees 1978) galaxy clusters are
formed through the successive mergers of galaxies, galaxy
groups, and subclusters. Galaxy clusters form, thus, the
largest gravitationnally bound structures in the universe.
Interestingly, X-ray observations have shown that most
of the baryonic mass of galaxy clusters resides not in
galaxies but in their hot intracluster gas (e.g. Jones &
Forman 1984)

Abell 85 is a rich galaxy cluster located at a redshift
of z ∼ 0.0555 with 305 conﬁrmed cluster members (Dur-
ret et al. 1998). Abell 85 is a bright X-ray source that
has been extensively studied using several X-ray satel-
lites (e.g. Markevitch et al. 1998; Lima Neto et al. 2001;
Sivakoﬀ et al. 2008). The X-ray emission of Abell 85
testiﬁes to an intense past merging activity (Durret et
al. 2005). Moreover, Abell 85 is not fully relaxed and is
currently merging with at least two satellite subclusters
(Kempner et al. 2002). The complex dynamical state of
Abell 85 was recently discussed in great detail by Ichi-
nohe et al. (2015). Due to its richness, Abell 85 has also
been the target of several studies on the morphology-
density relation (e.g. Fogarty et al. 2014).

Located in the core of galaxy clusters, and formed
through a rich merger history, brightest cluster galaxies
are, in turn, the most massive and luminous galaxies in
the universe (De Lucia & Blaizot 2007). Recently, L´opez-
Cruz et al. (2014) reported that the BCG of Abell 85 has
the largest galaxy core ever discovered. Note that the
BCG of Abell 85 has also been identiﬁed as Holm 15A.
The unusually large core in the surface brightness proﬁle
of the Abell 85 BCG translates into the presence of a su-

permassive black hole with masses above M• ∼ 1011M⊙.
The mass of the black hole is obtained by using scal-
ing relations between galaxy cores and black hole masses
(e.g. Kormendy & Ho 2013).

The results of L´opez-Cruz et al. (2014) were challenged
by Bonﬁni et al. (2015) who ﬁnd that the Abell 85 BCG
does not have a depleted core.
In fact, Bonﬁni et al.
(2015) ﬁnd that a S´ersic proﬁle plus an outer exponential
component provide a good ﬁt to the data.

Galaxy cores are deﬁned as a relative light deﬁcit to-
wards the nucleus of the galaxy compared to the inward
extrapolation of the surface brightness proﬁle of the outer
components of the galaxy. The physical theory postu-
lated to explain the presence of these cores is the action
of binary supermassive black holes that, through three-
body interactions, slingshot away stars in the galactic
center (Begelman et al. 1980).

Due to their possible link to black holes and galaxy
formation, the study of cores is an active ﬁeld with
many authors looking at diﬀerent theoretical and obser-
vational aspects. For instance, through N -body simula-
tions, Milosavljevi´c & Merritt (2001) modeled the decay
of a black hole binary and how it carves galactic cores.
Observationally, a major development in the study of
galaxy cores came with the analysis of Advanced Cam-
era for Surveys data. This instrument on-board HST
provided both superb resolution and large radial cover-
age, key factors in deriving an accurate surface bright-
ness proﬁle. Ferrarese et al. (2006) use a uniform sample
of 100 galaxies in Virgo imaged with the ACS to derive
their surface brightness proﬁle. They ﬁnd that the sur-
face brightness proﬁles of most galaxies are well ﬁt by
a S´ersic (1968) proﬁle. Earlier studies of galaxy cores
with the HST include the work of Faber et al. (1997)
and Laine et al. (2003), among many others.

In the following sections we present high-resolution
Gemini observations that have been obtained in order
to study in detail the surface brightness proﬁle of the
Abell 85 BCG, particularly focusing on its nuclear region.

2. GEMINI OBSERVATIONS OF ABELL 85

Gemini South observations of Abell 85 were obtained
under the Director’s Discretionary Time program GS-
2014B-DD-6. Abell 85 was observed with the Gemini
Multi Object Spectrograph (GMOS) on imaging mode
with the detector centered on the BCG, as shown in Fig-
ure 1. The data was obtained on 2014 November 15 un-
der stable atmospheric conditions on Cerro Pach´on with
a seeing of 0.56 arcseconds.

Two exposures of 200 s each were acquired during that
night. The ﬁlter in use was r G0326, this ﬁlter is centered
at 630 nm and has a ﬁlter width of 136 nm. We used a
2 × 2 binning that gives an eﬀective pixel scale of 0.160
arcseconds per pixel.

We adopt a redshift of Abell 85 z ∼ 0.0555 which yields
a distance of 233.9 Mpc and a scale of 1.075 kpc/arcsec.
The Gemini GMOS pixel scale for this observation of
Abell 85 is thus 172 pc/pixel.

3. DATA REDUCTION AND ANALYSIS

Data were processed with the standard Gemini
PyRAF package using the tasks described in this sec-
tion. We obtained bias, and twilight ﬂats from the ob-
servatory. These calibration ﬁles were already processed
through the tasks gbias and giflat. The science images
were bias subtracted and divided by the ﬂatﬁeld using
the task gireduce. These data were acquired using the
new CCD detectors (Hamamatsu) recently installed on
GMOS. Raw science data ﬁles have 12 extensions reﬂect-
ing the fact that the detector has three CCDs and four
ampliﬁers per CCD. A single component image was made
for each of the two exposures using the task gmosaic.
The ﬁnal science image was created combining the two
exposures using the task imcoadd.

For the study of the surface brightness proﬁle, the task
lucy, within stsdas, is used to deconvolve the image
by applying the Lucy-Richardson algorithm (Lucy 1974;
Richardson 1972). The task lucy converges after nine
iterations yielding a ﬁnal resolution of 0.45′′.

The ellipse routine (Jedrzejeswki 1987) is applied to
the science image in order to extract the 1D luminosity
proﬁle of the Abell 85 BCG. This proﬁle, directly ob-

tained from the science image is shown in Figure 2 as
blue circles.

In order to obtain an accurate light proﬁle for the tar-
geted galaxy, all nearby sources are properly masked and
the task ellipse ran iteratively until the surface bright-
ness proﬁle converges. We also ran the task ellipse with
diﬀerent initial parameters, while we held some (or all)
of the parameters (center, position angle, and ellipticity)
ﬁxed to a constant value to test wether we observe pos-
sible variations of the luminosity proﬁle. The resulting
luminosity proﬁle turned out to be robust and shows no
dependence on the initial parameters. Also, we did not
observe any shift in the center of the isophotes during
this experiment. Ellipticity remained mainly constant
i.e. 0.05 < e < 0.1. within the innermost few arcseconds.
Small ellipticity values imply relatively large errors for
the position angle.

Appropriately removing the sky background is also of
great importance in order to obtain an accurate surface
brightness proﬁle. The GMOS imager provides a rela-
tively large ﬁeld of view, at least when compared to HST
detectors, this allows us to make a ﬁrst estimate of the
sky background in an area of the detector where the Abell
85 BCG has very low emission.

Data taken by the Canada-France-Hawaii-Telescope
(CFHT) and surface brightness proﬁle of this galaxy pub-
lished by Donzelli et al. (2011) were also used to estimate
the sky background. CFHT data of Abell 85, in the r
band, taken under the Multi-Epoch Nearby Cluster Sur-
vey (MENeaCS) (Sand et al. 2011) in September 2008.
The basic assumption we use is that the surface bright-
ness proﬁle of the BCG of Abell 85 should be identical at
intermediate radii, independent of the telescope in use.
Once a correct estimate of the background is made,
both Gemini and CFHT surface brightness proﬁles agree
well, with the exception of the galaxy core where seeing
eﬀects dominate.

4. COMPARISON WITH RECENT WORK

L´opez-Cruz et al. (2014) use the Nuker model to ﬁt the
surface brightness proﬁle of the BCG of Abell 85 derived
with data taken by the KPNO 0.9 m telescope and a
seeing of 1.67′′. These data are not publicy available but
were given to us by O. L´opez-Cruz.

As shown in the top panel of Figure 2 and in Figure 3,
the new Gemini data reveals the presence of nuclear emis-
sion. This central and distinct feature is completely ab-
sent from the data presented by L´opez-Cruz et al. (2014).
In fact, the surface brightness proﬁle presented by the au-
thors above is featureless within the inner 20 kpc of the
center of the galaxy.

Using HST data, Cˆot´e et al. (2006) clearly demon-
strates that ground based data with poor seeing underes-
timates the presence of nucleii in nearby elliptical galax-
ies.

The Gemini data shows that from ∼6 kpc inwards, the
extrapolation of the surface brightness proﬁle results in
a light excess not a light deﬁcit as one might believe is
the case when looking at the lower quality KPNO data.
The above is true regardless of the model chosen to ﬁt
the surface brightness proﬁle of the galaxy. It should be
noted that the surface brightness proﬁles shown in Figure

Cruz et al. (2014). Top panel: Zoom of the inner 6 kpc. The new Gemini data shows nuclear emission not present in the KPNO 0.9 m
data analyzed by L´opez-Cruz et al. (2014). Bottom panel: Gemini and KPNO 0.9 m data up to 120 kpc in radius. The surface brightness
proﬁle of the KPNO data becomes noisy beyond ∼40 kpc. Our new Gemini data goes two magnitudes fainter than the KPNO data before
reaching similar noise levels.

5. NUCLEAR EMISSION AND NUCLEAR VARIABILITY

The presence of a clear light excess within the inner-
most kiloparsec of the BCG of Abell 85 prompts us to dis-
cuss its physical origin. One might attribute this nuclear
emission to the presence of an AGN given that BCGs are
more likely to host a radio-loud AGN than other galaxies
of similar mass (Best et al. 2007). The detection of X-ray
emission co-spatial with the galaxy core can be candidly
thought to be proof of the existence of an AGN. The
picture for Abell 85 is more complex. In fact, Sivakoﬀ,
et al. (2008) exclude the BCG from a census of active
galactic nuclei in Abell 85 given that its position also
corresponds, within a few arcseconds, to the peak X-ray
emission of the intracluster medium.

AGNs also have distinctive radio emission and Abell
85 has been observed in the radio (Bagchi et al. 1998;
Slee et al. 2001; Schenck et al. 2014). Based on the mor-
phology of the radio emission and its spectrum the above
authors do not ﬁnd evidence of strong AGN activity for
the BCG of Abell 85. The radio maps of Abell 85 do not
show jets or lobes that are the clear signatures of strong
and current AGN activity. On the contrary, those radio
maps are consistent with the presence of radio relics from
shocked gas or from a dead radio galaxy, the latter not
obviously cospacial with the BCG (Schenck et al. 2014).
We measured the ﬂux diﬀerence in the core of the
BCG between the CFHT and Gemini images. These
images were taken about six years apart: 2008 Septem-
ber (CFHT) and 2014 November (Gemini). Fluxes were

85 showing a clear nuclear emission that is seen on the surface
brightness proﬁle as a clear bump in the central kiloparsec, see top
panel of Figure 2. The scale bar on the lower right represents a
length of 2 kpc. This image was created using a logarithmic scale.

2 were derived using data that received no additional
processing beyond basic data reduction.

In their analysis of the CFHT data Bonﬁni et al. (2015)
detect a “tiny bump” in the light proﬁle within the inner
0.5′′. Indeed, their core-S´ersic model ﬁts a light excess
rather than a light deﬁcit within the inner 0.5′′.

At the faint end of the proﬁle, shown in the bottom
panel of Fig. 2, the KPNO data becomes noisy beyond
∼ 40 kpc from the center of the galaxy. Similar noise
levels are only present in the Gemini data at ∼ 120 kpc.

measured within an aperture of 1.5′′ for each detector.
This is the aperture at which the integrated magnitudes
of a point source converge for both detectors. We ﬁnd
∆mag = 0.10 ± 0.04, that is, the nucleus of the BCG
has become brighter by 0.10 magnitudes during the last
six years. This type of optical variability is suggestive
of the presence of an AGN in the core of the BCG. It is
known that all AGNs vary in short timescales (e.g. Ul-
rich et al. 1997). We should note that we also measure
the ﬂux diﬀerence in the core of a dozen random galaxies
common to both images and ﬁnd no diﬀerence above the
uncertainty level of 0.02 mag.

The variability within the core of the BCG of Abell
85, discussed above, hints to the presence of an AGN
but can also be of stellar origin particularly in a dense
nuclear stellar structure. Variability is indeed a deﬁning
property of AGNs that is often used for their discov-
ery. For instance, Cohen et al. (2000) search for vari-
able galaxies in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field to investi-
gate the presence of AGN and ﬁnd 45 solid candidates.
Those AGN candidates show characteristic variability of
∆mag ∼0.01 to 0.8 mag. On the other hand, dense star
clusters are favorite crash sites for binary stars, cata-
clysmic variables, and classical novae among other stellar
exotica (Knigge et al. 2002). Classical novae have been
found in extragalactic globular clusters and their erupt-
ing luminosity is comparable to their entire host (Shara
et al. 2004).

We ﬁnd that the core of the Abell 85 BCG is re-
solved with a FWHM of about 0.85′′, that is, about
50% larger than the FWHM of a stellar PSF. At the
distance of Abell 85, the physical size of the central com-
ponent is thus ∼0.9 kpc. This central nuclear compo-

nent, within the ﬁrst arcsecond, can be easily modeled
as a gaussian function with an integrated magnitude of
mr = 22.37 mag .

The resolved stellar structure in the core of the Abell
85 BCG has a physical size that is too large when com-
pared to nuclear star clusters. Indeed, nuclear star clus-
ter sizes are of the order of a few parsecs (e.g. ∼3 pc;
B¨oker 2010). Also, the largest nuclear structure found
by Cˆot´e et al. (2006) in their survey of the Virgo Cluster
has an eﬀective radius of 62 pc.

Based on its size, a Nuclear Stellar Disk (NSD) is a
more compatible candidate for the origin of the nuclear
emission of the Abell 85 BCG. For instance, Ledo et al.
(2010) compile a census of nuclear stellar disks in early
type galaxies. Several of these NSDs have sizes of a few
hundred parsecs with two of them having sizes larger
than 1 kpc. If the central structure of Abell 85 is indeed
a Nuclear Stellar Disk it would be among the largest
reported so far. To give more context we remark that
the catalogue of Ledo et al. (2010) is limited to galaxies
within 108 Mpc while Abell 85 is at more than twice this
distance. Also, the Abell 85 BCG is brigther than the
sample studied by Ledo et al. (2010).

Laine et al. (2003) study a sample of BCGs with lu-
minosities and distances similar to those of Abell 85 and
ﬁnd the presence of two nuclear stellar disks (Abell 261
and Abell 1142). Laine et al. (2003) also found an ad-
ditional seven BCGs with point-like nucleii that exhibit
similar morphology to the Abell 85 BCG.

With the current data, we favor a Nuclear Stellar
Disk as the physical explanation for the nuclear struc-
ture present in the core of the Abell 85 BCG. The
nuclear variability we measure is, however, more likely

5

We ﬁt a single S´ersic proﬁle to the new Gemini data.
For clarity, we deﬁne the S´ersic proﬁle in its canonical
form Rβ, where the concentration parameter β = 1/n is
the inverse of the S´ersic index (S´ersic 1968):

I(r) = Ieexpn − bnh(cid:16) r

r e(cid:17)β

− 1io

(1)

In this equation Ie is the intensity at r = re at the
eﬀective radius. The values for bn can be calculated using
bn ∼ 2n − 0.33 (Caon et al. 1993).

The best ﬁt of the S´ersic model to the Gemini data is
shown in Figure 4. We ﬁnd that a single S´ersic provides
a good ﬁt to the data only over a limited section of the
surface brightness proﬁle. Model and data diverge at
small radii, that is, for radii below ∼18 kpc.

The numerical parameters of the best ﬁt using a sin-
gle S´ersic model, such as an exceedingly large eﬀective
radius, expose the fact that this model does not pro-
vide a good physical representation of the overall surface
brightness proﬁle.

Studying a large sample of elliptical galaxies, Kor-
mendy et al. (2009) also ﬁnd that a single S´ersic proﬁle
is a good ﬁt to the main section of the radial proﬁle,
while the model deviates from the data at small radii.
Similarly, Lasker et al. (2014) need to include additional
components beyond a single S´ersic proﬁle when ﬁtting
the surface brightness proﬁle of 35 nearby galaxies. Ad-
ditional models correspond to additional physical com-
ponents such as bars, nuclei, inner disks, and envelopes.

6.3. Nuker Model

We also ﬁt a Nuker model to the Gemini data and
present the results in Figure 5. Numerical parameters
are given in Table 1. Interestingly, we ﬁnd an even larger
cusp radius, rγ = 5.02 kpc than the one found by L´opez-
Cruz et al. (2014). We ﬁnd however a break radius of
rb = 11.6 kpc, almost half the value of L´opez-Cruz et al.
(2014).

An important caveat to ﬁtting a Nuker model to this
galaxy is the fact that it does not actually have a ﬂat
evacuated core and the Nuker model does not identify
the presence of the nuclear component. The existence
of this distinct nuclear component naturally changes the
results given by the Nuker model ﬁt, as shown above.
Also, it has been proved that the Nuker model is depen-
dent on the radial extent of the ﬁt (Graham et al. 2003).
Moreover, the Nuker model was never intended to ﬁt the
entire surface brightness proﬁle but the central region of
any given galaxy – see the recent work of Bonﬁni et al.
(2015) and references therein.

The Nuker model used by L´opez-Cruz et al. (2014)
underestimates their data beyond ∼20 kpc. The failure
of the Nuker proﬁle at large radii prompts L´opez-Cruz et
al. (2014) to ﬁt a de Vaucouleurs proﬁle (i.e. S´ersic proﬁle
with n = 4). It should be noted that the de Vaucouleurs
proﬁle used by L´opez-Cruz et al. (2014) overestimates
their data in the outskirts of the galaxy.

6.4. Core-S´ersic

In a recent work Bonﬁni et al. (2015) carry out a de-
tailed re-analysis of the CFHT data of the Abell 85 BCG
focusing on ﬁtting the core-S´ersic model. Bonﬁni et al.

data within the inner ∼18 kpc. Residuals are shown in the bottom
panel.
associated with an AGN. Additional data points are
needed in order to build a better sampled light curve
and unambiguously identify the origin of the variability.

6. FITS TO THE SURFACE BRIGHTNESS PROFILE USING

THE NEW GEMINI DATA

Diﬀerent models used to ﬁt the radial surface bright-
ness proﬁle of galaxies can be found in the literature.
Commonly used analytical functions are the S´ersic (1968)
proﬁle, which is a generalization of the de Vaucouleurs
(1948) and exponential proﬁles, the Moﬀat (1969) pro-
ﬁle, and the Gaussian proﬁle. Models that use addi-
tional parameters to account for the parametrization of
galaxy cores are a blend of two power laws (Ferrarese et
al. 1994), the Nuker model (Lauer 1995), and the core-
S´ersic proﬁle (Graham et al. 2003). The King (1966)
model is commonly used to ﬁt the radial light proﬁle of
globular clusters and small galaxies.

In this section, the results of ﬁtting diﬀerent analyti-
cal models to the new Gemini data are presented. The
results of our best ﬁts and the ﬁts of Lopez-Cruz et al.
(2014) are shown in Table 1. The ﬁts below are applied
to the deconvolved image. The ﬁts are carried out to
a galactocentric distance of 115 kpc, that is, where the
standard deviation of the sky (∼0.3 mag) equals the un-
certainty on the galaxy surface brightness.

6.1. de Vaucouleurs

Schombert (1987) showed that a de Vaucouleurs (1948)
model fails to properly ﬁt the surface brightness proﬁle of
the Abell 85 BCG. A de Vaucouleurs ﬁt for this galaxy
overestimates the ﬂux at the center while it underesti-
mates the ﬂux in the outskirts. Schombert (1987), also
showed that this result was also true for several other
BCGs.

6.2. Single S´ersic

(2015) ﬁnd that the Abell 85 BCG does not have a de-
pleted core as the light proﬁle does not show a light deﬁcit
when ﬁtted with the core-S´ersic model. In fact, these au-
thors ﬁnd that the Abell 85 BCG is not well adjusted by
a core-S´ersic due to a light excess in its central surface
brightness proﬁle. Bonﬁni et al. (2015) ﬁnd that the
Abell 85 BCG is a core-less galaxy whose surface bright-
ness proﬁle is best ﬁt by an inner S´ersic proﬁle and an
outer exponential halo.

6.5. Double S´ersic

Gonzalez et al. (2003, 2005) and Seigar et al. (2007)
showed that two component models are necessary to
accurately ﬁt the surface brightness proﬁles of BCGs.
The two components pertain to an inner and outer
component. The existence of an outer component re-

of 10 kpc. This image was made using a logarithmic display.

ﬂects the fact that BCGs often have extended envelopes
(Schombert 1987). Donzelli et al. (2011) studied the lu-
minosity proﬁles of 430 BCGs and found that about half
of them required a double S´ersic model (S´ersic + expo-
nential). In fact, Donzelli et al. (2011) ﬁt the Abell 85
BCG with an inner S´ersic model and an outer exponen-
tial component.

We ﬁt a double S´ersic proﬁle to the Gemini data, and
obtain satisfactory results. The values of our best ﬁt are
shown in Table 1 and Figure 6. One component has a
S´ersic index of 1/n = 0.93 (dashed line) while the second
S´ersic has an index of 1/n = 0.84 (dotted line). The sum
of these two components (a solid line) is indistinguishable
from the data.

Models that explain the underlying physical mecha-
nisms that create double S´ersic components have been
postulated by Cooper et al. (2015). These authors pos-
tulate that for BCGs, the double S´ersic proﬁle originates
from the superposition of two debris components of dif-
ferent progenitors. The inner proﬁle is associated with
relaxed accreted components while the outer proﬁle cor-
responds with unrelaxed accreted debris (Cooper et al.
2015).

The best ﬁt to the surface brightness of this galaxy is
given by a double S´ersic model. Values for the goodness
of ﬁt (χ2) are presented in Table 1 and a residual image
is shown on Figure 7. We should note that the χ2 value
given for the single S´ersic ﬁt pertains to a ﬁt between 20
and 115 kpc, a ﬁt over the whole range of the data would
yield χ2 = 2750.

7. DOES THE ABELL 85 BCG HOST THE MOST MASSIVE

BLACK HOLE IN THE UNIVERSE?

Based on the analysis of new Gemini data presented
above we conclude that the Abell 85 BCG (Holm 15A)
is a nucleated, coreless galaxy. That is, it does not have
an exceptionally large core due to a light deﬁcit in its
central region (L´opez-Cruz et al. 2014). Our results thus
nullify the existence of a supermassive black hole based
solely on the presence of a depleted core that this galaxy,
in fact, does not have.

By ﬁtting the Nuker model to the surface brightness
proﬁle we ﬁnd a large cusp and break radius. We refrain
from interpreting the cusp and break radius as represen-
tative of an evacuated core created by the scouring action

of a binary black hole. A large cusp radius, derived from
the Nuker model, does not necesarily imply a downward
bend of the inner light proﬁle.

Recently, Bonﬁni et al. (2015) point out that the pres-
ence of a singular point in the surface brightness proﬁle
of any given galaxy does not imply the presence of a de-
pleted core. In the words of Bonﬁni et al. (2015) most
galaxies have particular values for the negative logarith-
mic slope of the intensity proﬁle but this is not a suﬃcient
condition for the existence of a depleted core.

Moreover, the central brightness proﬁle of the Abell 85
BCG is indeed diﬀerent from the ﬂat, or even decreas-
ing surface brightness proﬁle of, for instance, the BCG
of Abell 2261 (Postman et al. 2012). The presence of
nuclear structure is diﬃcult to reconcile with a core of
∼ 5 kpc where other stars within that core are ejected.
