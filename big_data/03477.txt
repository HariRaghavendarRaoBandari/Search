Stability Analysis of Networked Systems Containing Damped and

Undamped Nodes*

Filip Koerts1, Mathias B¨urger2, Arjan van der Schaft3, Claudio De Persis4

Abstract— This paper answers the question if a qualitatively
heterogeneous passive networked system containing damped
and undamped nodes shows consensus in the output of the nodes
in the long run. While a standard Lyapunov analysis shows that
the damped nodes will always converge to a steady-state value,
the convergence of the undamped nodes is much more delicate
and depends on the parameter values of the network as well as
on the topology of the graph. A complete stability analysis is
presented based on an eigenvector analysis involving the mass
values and the topology of both the original graph and the
reduced graph obtained by a Kron reduction that eliminates
the damped nodes.

Keywords—qualitatively heterogeneous networks; undamped
nodes; Kron reduction; consensus dynamics

form of connectivity notions. The relevance of the network
topology becomes more evident if, e.g., the controllability
of a network is analyzed ([14], [17]). When considering the
whole network as one system, the controllability depends
heavily on the topological location of the control inputs (i.e.,
the location of the controlled nodes) in the network. In [17],
the controllability of leader-follower consensus networks has
been connected to the symmetry of the graph with respect to
the control nodes (leaders). Similarly, the research direction
of pinning control investigates the question, where to place
a limited number of controllers in a network to achieve
synchronization (see [18] for a survey).

I. INTRODUCTION

One of the fundamental control problems related to network
systems is the consensus or synchronization problem, where
it is of interest to couple dynamical systems in such a way
that they evolve asymptotically in an identical manner, see
e.g. [3], [4]. Synchronization is a relevant stability-like prop-
erty in numerous applications such as power systems, where
frequencies of the power generators should be synchronized,
which can be found in [9], or platooning vehicles, where the
vehicles velocities should be synchronized, see e.g. [5], [10].

Synchronization problems are particularly challenging if the
individual systems are not identical but heterogeneous. There
has been tremendous research on synchronization of hetero-
geneous systems (e.g., using dynamic coupling controllers)
[1], [2], [8]. A way do deal with heterogeneity in networks
that is particularly relevant to this paper, is to exploit system
properties such as passivity [7], [16]. Roughly speaking, the
conceptual idea is as follows. If all - possibly heterogeneous -
nodes are strictly passive (w.r.t. the outputs used for coupling)
and the couplings are passive then synchronization can be
achieved. This conceptual idea is extremely powerful for the
analysis of heterogeneous networks and extends in various
directions. E.g., passive networks are directly related to
network optimization problems [2] and can exhibit complex
dynamic behavior such as clustering [1]. Furthermore, passiv-
ity is also relevant in the analysis of power networks [19]. We
study in this paper a basic class of passive networks, namely
linear mass-spring-damper networks with constant external
forces. While this model is simpliﬁed it captures many of
the relevant properties of networks of passive systems as
studied in [2], [7], [16].

When considering synchronization, the relevant topological
conditions on the network basically boil down to some

In some sense, research on pinning control deals also with
heterogeneous networks, while the heterogeneity is here
qualitative (nodes are either controlled or uncontrolled). In
fact, with such a qualitative heterogeneity in the network, the
graph topology becomes highly important.

We study in this paper a class of passive networks with
a qualitative heterogeneity. In particular, we consider mass-
spring-type networks with many undamped and few damped
nodes. This type of models might be applied to networks that
contain a minority of nodes with damping constants being
considerably higher than damping constants of other nodes.
A natural approach would be to approximate damping values
below some threshold value to zero.

To study the convergence of the network, we use a Lyapunov
function that is exactly the Lyapunov function used in [2],
[7], or [16]. However, as in this paper the network contains
undamped nodes, convergence cannot be ensured with this
Lyapunov function. In fact, depending on the location of the
damped nodes, the network can exhibit oscillatory behavior.
The main result of this paper is a set of fairly simple
and easily veriﬁable graph theoretic conditions ensuring
convergence. Our result has various implications, which can
be found in the concluding section.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The
dynamical network model and the graph formalism is in-
troduced in Section II. System characteristics such as the
network equilibrium and the ability to shift the equilibrium
are covered in Section III. The convergence analysis is
performed in Section IV, where ﬁrst a Lyapunov analysis
is presented, followed by a characterization of the invariant
subspace, leading to the main result of the paper, a precise
characterization of the convergence condition.

II. PRELIMINARIES

The system parameters are:

We consider an undirected and connected graph G = (V, E)
with n nodes and m edges and incidence matrix B. On each
node i ∈ V , a dynamical system Σi is placed which is
modeled as

• M := diag(M1, . . . , Mn) ≻ 0, a block diagonal matrix

containing inertia matrices of the individual nodes.

• R := diag(R1, . . . , Rn) < 0, a block diagonal matrix

with damping matrices of the individual nodes.

˙pi = −Riyi + ui + vi,

yi = M −1

i pi

(1)

where pi ∈ Rr and yi ∈ Rr are the state and the output,
respectively. Further, we have the damping matrix Ri < 0,
inertia matrix Mi ≻ 0, coupling input ui and a constant
external input vi ∈ Rr. On each edge k = (i, j) ∈ E, a
dynamical controller Γk of dimension r is placed with state
qk ∈ Rr, output fk ∈ Rr and is modeled as:

˙qk = zk,

fk =Wkqk

(2)

Here, Wk ≻ 0 is the edge weight matrix of edge k. Variables
without subscript denote the corresponding stacked variables
of the plants and controllers. The coupling is established
through

u = −(B ⊗ Ir)f,

z = (B ⊗ Ir)T y

(3)

where ⊗ denotes the Kronecker product and Ir the r × r
identity matrix. In the sequel, we will use the abbreviated
notation B := B ⊗ Irc.
Deﬁnition. A node i ∈ V is said to be damped if Ri ≻ 0. A
node is undamped if Ri = 0, while it is partially undamped
if Ri is singular.
Assumption. The set V of nodes is partitioned into a set
Vd of damped nodes with cardinality nd ≥ 1 and a set
Vu of (partially) undamped nodes with cardinality nu ≥ 1.
Hence, there is at least one damped and at least one (partially)
undamped node.

Remark. In the context of a mass-spring-damper system,
node states pi can be seen as momenta of the masses, while
qk is the elongation of the springs. The node output yi
represents velocities, whereas the controller output fk stands
for the force acting on its endpoints.

A. Closed-loop system

Let p = col(p1, . . . , pn), q = col(q1, . . . , qm) be the stacked
state vectors and similarly for the other variables. Taking
(1), (2) and (3) together, we obtain the closed-loop system,
denoted by Σ × Γ and whose state and output is denoted
by z := col(p, q) ∈ Rr(n+m) and y ∈ Rrn, respectively. Its
state-space representation reads as ˙z = Az +Gv, y = M −1p,
where

• W := diag(W1, . . . Wm) ≻ 0,

the block diagonal

matrix with spring constants (edge weights).

• v, a constant external input

2 pT M p + 1

Remark. The system Σ × Γ can be written in a
port-Hamiltonian representation by using the Hamiltonian
˙H = vT y −
H(p, q) = 1
yT Ry ≤ vT y, which shows that Σ × Γ is passive, but not
output strictly passive as R is singular. Hence, this does not
give us the wanted convergence results and we need to invoke
LaSalle’s Theorem (section IV).

2 qT W q. This gives

B. Second-order dynamics

Since G is connected, rank(B) = n − 1. Furthermore,
ker(BT ) = im(1), where 1 is the stacked vector of all
ones. Also, ker B = im(Ir), where Ir := 1 ⊗ Ir. In fact,
B represents a graph consisting of r connected components
that are copies of G.

A fundamental cycle matrix C of G is a matrix of full column
rank that satisﬁes ker(B) = im(C), see e.g. [13]1. The full
column rank matrix C := C ⊗ Ir satisﬁes ker(B) = im(C).

Note that since ˙q ∈ im(BT ),
the projection of q onto
im(BT )⊥ = ker(B) = im(C) can be written as Cr for some
r ∈ Rr(m−n+1) and is such that q(t) ∈ im(BT ) + Cr for
all t ≥ 0. By integrating the output y, we obtain potentials
0 y(τ )dτ + s0, where s0 satisﬁes
q(0) = BT s0 + W −1Cr. This decomposition is possible
and unique. All terms in the equation ˙p = −Ry − BW q + v
can be written in terms of (derivatives) of s and the result is
a second order equation:

or positions s(t) := R t

M ¨s = −R ˙s − BW BT s + v

(5)

We deﬁne L := BW BT to be the total Laplacian matrix.
Notice that this is indeed a Laplacian matrix: it is symmetric
and the row and column sums are zero. In fact, ker(L) =
ker(LT ) = im(Ir). Some off-diagonal entries of L are
positive if and only if there are Wk’s with negative off-
diagional entries. This does not affect the stability, since W
is positive-semideﬁnite (see section IV).

In the sense of consensus dynamics, it is of interest to know
whether the nodes show output consensus in the long run,
that is, if y converges to a point in im{Ir} as t → ∞. In
case the system fails to show consensus, it is of interest to
know the non-trivial steady-state behavior. From that, we
derive useful information such as the degrees of freedom of
the nodes at steady state. Therefore, we ask ourselves in this
paper:

Problem. Does every plant output trajectory y(t) of Σ × Γ,
i.e. system (4), converges to a point in the set im{Ir}? If not,
what is the steady-state behavior of Σ × Γ?

III. SYSTEM CHARACTERISTICS

In this section, we give the equilibria and perform a shift so
that the equilibrium is located at the origin. Note ﬁrst that
the afﬁne subspaces of Rrm\im(BT ) are invariant under the
dynamics of the controller state q(t). We have the following
characterization of B and C:

Lemma 3.1: im(BT ) ⊕ im(W −1C) = Rm and im(BT ) ∩
im(W −1C) = {0}.

Proof: The ﬁrst

statement

follows

As a result, the set of solutions z(t) = col(p(t), q(t)) of Σ×Γ
where q(t) is in one of the afﬁne subspaces of Rrm\im(BT )
is a shifted copy of those solutions of Σ × Γ where q(t) ∈
im(BT ). Consequently, without loss of generality we can
assume that q ∈ im(BT ).

Corollary 3.2: For
=
col(p(0), q(0)) ∈ Rr(n+m), there exists a unique vector
γ ∈ Rr(m−n+1) such that q∗(0) := q(0) − W −1Cγ ∈
im(BT ). Furthermore, with shifted initial
conditions
z∗(0) = col(p(0), q∗(0)),
trajectory difference
the
z∗(t) − z(t) is constant for all t ≥ 0.

z(0)

Proof: Existence and uniqueness of γ follow from

Lemma 3.1

Given that at some time t ≥ 0, p∗(t) = p(t) and q∗(t) −
q(t) ∈ im(W −1C), we have y∗(t) = y(t) and BW (q∗(t) −
˙q∗(t) − ˙q(t) = 0.
q(t)) = 0, hence ˙p∗(t) − ˙p(t) = 0. Also,

If we restrict q to be in the invariant space of im(BT ), the
system Σ × Γ has a unique equilibrium:

Proposition 3.3: The system Σ × Γ restricted to q ∈ im(BT )
has a unique equilibrium ¯z = col(¯p, ¯q) satisfying ¯p =

M Irβ and {¯q} = (cid:2)W −1B†(−RIrβ + v) + im(W −1C)(cid:3) ∩

im(BT ).2 In these expressions, β is given by

β = (IT

r RIr)−1IT
r v

(7)

Proof: From ˙¯q = 0, we obtain BT M −1 ¯p = 0. Since
for connected graphs, ker(BT ) = im{Ir}, it follows that
¯p ∈ im{M Ir}. Write ¯p = M Irβ for some β ∈ Rr. The
value of β can be obtained by setting ˙¯p = 0, which gives
−RIrβ + v ∈ im(B) and consequently −IT
r v ∈
B) = {0}. Since Ri ≻ 0 for at least one i ∈ V , it
im(IT
r
follows that IT
r RIr ≻ 0 and thus β can be given uniquely as
in (7). Substituting this result in the dynamics of p, we obtain
BW ¯q = −RIrβ +v, which gives ¯q ∈ W −1B†(−RIrβ +v)+
im(W −1C), with im(W −1C) = ker(BW ). By assumption
and by the dynamics of q, ¯q ∈ im(BT ). The intersection of
both sets is a singleton by Lemma 3.1.

r RIrβ + IT

Remark. The unique equilibrium point for q(0) ∈ im(BT )
corresponds to a state of output consensus since ¯v =
M −1 ¯p ∈ im{Ir}. Also for q(0) /∈ im(BT ), it is shown
readily that ¯v = Irβ with β being given by (7).

A. Shifted model

Now, we introduce shifted state variables so that the equilib-
rium coincides with the origin. The main beneﬁt of doing this
is that it allows to use common techniques to show output
consensus in section 4.2. Besides that, we get rid of the
constant input v in the dynamics. Deﬁne ˜p(t) = p(t) − ¯p,
˜q(t) = q(t) − ¯q. Stack these together in the state vector

2Here, † denotes the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse.

˜z = col(˜p, ˜q) and deﬁne the output ˜y = M −1p, then we
obtain the linear time-invariant (LTI) closed-loop system

(8)

Since ¯q ∈ im(BT ), it follows that q(t) ∈ im(BT ) if and only
if ˜q(t) ∈ im(BT ). By assumption, Σ × Γ is only deﬁned on
the invariant subspace

Ω = {col(˜p, ˜q) ∈ Rr(n+m) | ˜q ∈ im(BT )}

System (8) deﬁned on Ω has a unique equilibrium point at
¯˜z = 0. Similarly to the procedure in section IIA, we can

introduce variables ˜s(t) = col(˜sd(t), ˜su(t)) := R ˜y(τ )dτ +

˜s0, where ˜s0 is such that ˜q(0) = BT ˜s0, to obtain the second-
order equation

M ¨˜s = −R ˙˜s − L˜s

Noting that ˜q(t) = BT ˜s(t) and ˜p(t) = M ˙˜s(t), (8) can
be written equivalently as an LTI system with states ˜s and
˜y. In the next section we ﬁnd Lemma 4.2 that connects
global asymptotic stability of (8) deﬁned on Ω with output
consensus of (4).

IV. STEADY-STATE BEHAVIOR

In this section, we determine the long-run behavior of (8)
deﬁned on Ω by performing a common Lyapunov analysis.
This allows us to derive the set of points to which all
solutions converge. To ﬁnd necessary conditions for the
steady-state behavior, we use as Lyapunov function the
Hamiltonian function that has a minimum at the equilibrium
point (¯˜p, ¯˜q) = (0, 0):

U (˜p, ˜q) =

1

˜pT M −1 ˜p +

˜qT W ˜q

The time derivative of U (˜p, ˜q) now reads as

˙U (˜p, ˜q) = ˙˜pT M −1 ˜p + ˙˜qT W ˜q

= (−RM −1 ˜p − BW ˜q)T M −1 ˜p + ˜pT M −1BW ˜q

From the fact that M and W are positive deﬁnite, U is
a postive-deﬁnite function for (˜p, ˜q) 6= (0, 0), while ˙U is
negative semi-deﬁnite, U is a suitable Lyapunov function.

Lemma 4.1: The system ˙˜z = A˜z as deﬁned in (8), is stable.
Proof: Since ˙U is everywhere nonpositive on Rr(n+m),
we deduce that ˜z(t)T ˜M ˜z(t) ≤ ˜z(0)T ˜M ˜z(0) for all t ≥
˜M := diag(M −1, W ) ≻ 0. Noting that
0, where

λmin( ˜M ) > 0,

the min-max theorem yields k˜z(t)k2≤

qλmax( ˜M )/λmin( ˜M )k˜z(0)k2 for all t ≥ 0.

Lemma 4.2: Every trajectory y(t) of Σ × Γ,
i.e. system
(4), converges to a point in the set im{Ir} if and only if
every trajectory ˜z(t) = col(˜p(t), ˜q(t)) of (8) deﬁned on Ω
converges to the origin.

Proof: In this proof, every convergence statement holds
exclusively for t → ∞. (⇒) Suppose that every output
trajectory y(t) of Σ × Γ converges to im{Ir}, then this holds
in particular for those trajectories generated with q(0) ∈
im(BT ). So p(t) → p∗, where p∗ ∈ im{M Ir}. From Lemma
4.1, we deduce that ¨p(t) is bounded, hence ˙p(t) is uniformly
continuous and we can apply Barbalat’s lemma to conclude
that ˙p(t) → 0. That gives −RM −1p(t) − BW q(t) + v → 0.
So BW q(t) converges too and consequently, q(t) → q∗ +
ker(BW ) for some q∗ ∈ Rm. Since q(t) ∈ im(BT ), we
have that q(t) → im(BT ) ∩ [q∗ + ker(BW )], which is a
singleton, so q(t) converges too and consequently, the whole
state z(t) converges. Uniqueness of the equilibrium implies
that z(t) → ¯z and hence ˜z(t) → 0. (⇐) For every trajectory
˜z(t) → 0 we have z(t) → ¯z, yielding y(t) → ¯y = M −1 ¯p =
Irβ, with β as in (7).

Lemma 4.2 shows that output consensus in the long run
of the system Σ × Γ is equivalent to global asymptotic
stability (GAS) of the system (8) deﬁned on Ω and we will
interchangeably use both terms.

Now we use LaSalle’s invariance principle, which is a
necessary condition for the long-run behavior: as t goes to
inﬁnity, the trajectory converges to the largest invariant set
in the set of states where ˙U = 0.

Lemma 4.3: Every trajectory ˜z∗(t) of (8) deﬁned on Ω
converges to S LS, which we deﬁne to be the set of initial
conditions ˜z(0) such that for all t ≥ 0, ˜pd(t) = 0 and ˜pu(t) ∈
u ), where the trajectory ˜z(t) = col(˜p(t), ˜q(t)) is
ker(RuM −1
the solution of (8) with initial condition ˜z(0).

Proof: The set of points in the state space where
˙U = 0 is, by positive deﬁniteness of M −1
and
by ker(M −1
u ), equal to the set
of points in the state space where ˜pd = 0 and ˜pu ∈
ker(RuM −1

A. Behavior of the undamped nodes at steady state

In this subsection, we give a precise characterization of S LS
as deﬁned in Lemma 4.3 and work towards an LTI system
that is observable if and only if output consensus of Σ × Γ is
achieved. We introduce the following terminology: denote by
Obs(C, A) the observability matrix associated with the pair
(C, A). In the following Lemma, S LS is written as a linear
transformation of the unobservable subspace of a linear time-
invariant system that gives the steady-state behavior of the
undamped nodes in the (˜yu, ˜su) coordinates.

Proof: (⊆) Take ˜z(0) ∈ S LS and consider the trajectory
˜z(t) = eAt˜z(0) ∈ Ω, which is a solution to (8). Decompose
˜z as col(˜pd, ˜pu, ˜q), then we have for all t ≥ 0: ˜pd(t) = 0,

Here, the row and column decomposition of ˘C and ˘A are
such that the ﬁrst block is in accordance with ˜pu and the
second with ˜q.

Remark.

• The state trajectories col(˜yu, ˜su) of the system ( ˆC, ˆA)
describe the behavior of the undamped nodes in the
reduced graph with total Laplacian matrix ˜Lu, which
is obtained by eliminating the damped nodes accord-
ing to a Kron reduction. This changes the topology
including edge weights, but connectivity is preserved,
hence ker(˜Lu) = im(Ir). ˆQ represents the transfor-
mation matrix of the (˜yu(t), ˜su(t)) coordinates to the
(˜pd(t), ˜pu(t), ˜qu(t)) coordinates at steady state. Further-
more, Li
i ˜yu = 0 is an algebraic constraint that boils
down to BdW ˜q(t) = 0, i.e. zero net force at damped
nodes in the original graph. Finally,
the constraint
Ru ˜yu = 0 assures that partially undamped nodes can
only move in directions in which they do not experience
resistance.

• The system ( ˘C, ˘A) gives the dynamics of the undamped
nodes when the damped nodes would be ﬁxed at a
single position. The set of solutions of ( ˘C, ˘A) for which
BdW ˜q(t) ≡ 0, RuM −1
u ˜pu(t) ≡ 0 and ˜q(t) ∈ im(BT )
for all t ≥ 0 is equal to the set of long-run trajectories
of ˜z of the system (8) deﬁned on Ω in which every
solution is premultiplied by ˘Q.

We show that all solutions in S LS are composed of periodic
functions, which are in fact sinusoids:

Proposition 4.5: Each solution ˜z(t) ∈ Ω of system (8) can
be written as a ﬁnite sum of sinusoids.

Proof: Note that ˘A can be written as a product of a skew-
symmetric matrix and a positive-deﬁnite diagonal matrix.
Indeed, we have

Since ˘A = ˘B ˘W is similar to the real skew-symmetric
matrix ˘W
2 , it has purely imaginary eigenvalues that
are semisimple3. Take any solution ˜z(·) ∈ Ω of
(8),
then ˜pd(t) ≡ 0 and the trajectories col(˜pu(t), ˜q(t)) =
e ˘Atcol(˜pu(0), ˜q(0)) are composed of periodic functions of
the form cos(I(λi)t)R(xi) + sin(I(λi)t)I(xi), where xi is
an eigenvector of ˆA and λi is a semisimple, purely imaginary
eigenvalue.

3A real skew-symmetric matrix is a normal matrix, which has the property

to be diagonalizable.

Each component cos(I(λi)t)R(xi) + sin(I(λi)t)I(xi) of
˜z(t) corresponds to a group of nodes that is oscillating
with the same frequency I(λi). The nodes in this group are
indicated by the non-zero entries in xi. If undamped nodes
belong to multiple oscillating groups, they might oscillate
with multiple frequencies.

Due to this periodic character of the components of the
solutions, we cannot ﬁnd a proper subset of S LS to which
all solutions converge. Hence,

Corollary 4.6: The smallest set to which all solutions of (8)
in Ω converge is given by S LS.

From Lemma 4.1 and the periodic character of ˜z(t) at
steady state, the solutions of (8) in Ω are bounded. This
has an important implication: the sum of the momenta of
the undamped nodes turn out to be zero:

Proposition 4.7: (Conservation of momentum at
steady
state) For any solution ˜z(t) = col(˜pd(t), ˜pu(t), ˜q(t)) of (8)
in Ω, it holds that IT

r ˜pu(t) ≡ 0.

r Mu ˜yu(t) ≡ 0. Thus, IT

In the (˜yu, ˜su) coordinates, we ﬁnd that conservation of
momentum leads to IT
r Mu ˜yu(t)
might serve as an additional output variable to the system
( ˆC, ˆA) that does not affect the unobservable subspace. What
is more, the same holds for its integral IT
r Mu˜su(t) so that
S LS can be written equivalently as follows:
Corollary 4.8: S LS = ˆQ ker(Obs( ˆˆC, ˆA)), where

ˆˆC =

Proof: (⊆) Due to the freedom to choose an ˜s(0) that
satisﬁes (12), we can choose one that satisﬁes IT
r Mu˜su(0) =
0. To see that this is possible, consider solutions ˜s(t) =
col(˜sd(t), ˜su(t)) and ˜yu(t) that satisfy (11), (12), (13), (14)
and (15). Replacing ˜s(t) by ˜s∗(t) = ˜s(t) − Irα with

α = (IT

B. Conditions on output consensus

By combining Lemmas 4.2, 4.3 and Corollaries 4.6, 4.8, we
ﬁnd that the pair ( ˆˆC, ˆA) is observable if and only output
consensus is guaranteed:

Proposition 4.9: All output trajectories y(t) of Σ × Γ con-
verges to a point in im{Ir} if and only if ker(Obs( ˆˆC, ˆA)) =
{0}.

Proof: From Lemma 4.2, all output trajectories y(t)
of Σ × Γ converge to a point in im{Ir} if and only if
every trajectory ˜z(t) = col(˜p(t), ˜q(t)) of (8) deﬁned on Ω
converges to the origin. Since S LS is the smallest set to

which all state trajectories of (8) deﬁned on Ω converge, that
is equivalent to S LS = ˆQ ker(Obs( ˆˆC, ˆA)) = {0}. It follows
immediately that ker(Obs( ˆˆC, ˆA)) = {0} results in S LS =
{0}. Now suppose that S LS = ˆQ ker(Obs( ˆˆC, ˆA)) = {0},
i.e. ker(Obs( ˆˆC, ˆA)) ⊆ ker( ˆQ). Note that ker(Obs( ˆˆC, ˆA)) ⊆

ker(cid:0)0 IT

ker( ˆQ) ⊆ ker(cid:20)(cid:18)0 M −1

Hence,

ker( ˆQ) ∩ ker(Obs( ˆˆC, ˆA))

⊆ im(cid:18) 0

Ir(cid:19) ∩ ker(cid:0)0 IT

r Mu(cid:1) = {0}

Then, by assumption we obtain ker(Obs( ˆˆC, ˆA)) = {0}.

We come to the following equivalence relation that con-
nects the output consensus problem with the eigenspaces of
M −1

˜Lu and M −1L:

Theorem 4.10: The following is equivalent:

(i) Every plant output trajectory y(t) of Σ × Γ converges

to a point in the set im{Ir}.

(ii) None of the eigenvectors of M −1

(21)

(iii) Every eigenvector of M −1L in the kernel of R has at
least one nonzero value in an entry that corresponds to
a damped node, i.e. for each µ ∈ σ(M −1L):

ker(M −1L − µI) ∩ ker(R) ∩ im(cid:18) 0

Inur(cid:19) = {0}

(22)
Proof: (i) ⇐⇒ (ii) From Proposition 4.9, condition (i)
holds if and only if ker(Obs( ˆˆC, ˆA)) = {0}. According to
Hautus lemma, that is equivalent to

rank  ˆA − λI

ˆˆC ! = 2nu

∀λ ∈ C

Equivalently, from the rank-nullity theorem: ∀λ ∈ C it must
hold that if

then ˜yu = 0 and ˜su = 0. For λ = 0, this implication always
holds, since from the second block row it follows that ˜yu = 0
and from the ﬁrst block row, ˜su ∈ im{Ir}, which, combined
with the bottom block row IT
r Mu˜su = 0, yields ˜su = 0
(notice that im(Ir) ∩ ker(IT

r Mu) = {0}).

So it remains to consider λ ∈ C\{0}, for which ˜yu =

r Mu˜su =
˜Lu ˜yu = 0, hence the last block row is
− 1
λ2 IT
always satisﬁed if the block rows above are satisﬁed too.
Thus, for all λ 6= 0, the only solutions of (23) are ˜yu = 0,
˜su = 0 if and only if for all λ 6= 0,

r Mu yields IT

for any eigenvalue µ = −λ ∈ σ(M −1
˜Lu − µI) = im(Ir)
Since for µ = 0 ∈ σ(M −1
i) = {0}4, (21) always holds for µ = 0.
and im(Ir) ∩ ker(Li
(ii) ⇐⇒ (iii) Write out ˜Lu in the left-hand side of the ﬁrst
equation in (24) where λ 6= 0 and use the second constraint

Hence, (21) is true for any µ ∈ σ(M −1
if there does not exist an eigenvector of M −1L correspond-
ing to a nonzero eigenvalue that is in the kernel of R and
of the form col(0, ˜su). Also, (22) is always true for µ = 0.
Thus, the latter condition is equivalent to (iii).

We give the following corollary without proof:

Corollary 4.11: By a change of coordinates, we can extend

V. CONCLUSION

We considered a class of qualitatively heterogeneous net-
worked models that includes mass-spring-damper networks
and studied the output consensus problem of determining
whether the plant output trajectories converge to an agree-
ment value. This problem can be tackled by performing a
stability analysis of a shifted model of the network (Lemma
4.2). If this system is not globally asymptotically stable
(GAS),
then some of the undamped nodes exhibit oscil-
latory behavior at steady state. The oscillation space can
be obtained from the unobservable subspace of a reduced
system that gives the dynamics of the undamped nodes at
steady state (Lemma 4.4). In a steady state, the nodes show
conservation of momentum (Lemma 4.7). This brings us at
a system that is observable if and only if output consensus
is guaranteed (Lemma 4.9). Alternatively,
the consensus
problem is equivalent to an eigenspace problem that depends
on the graph topology, the edge weights, the mass values and
the resistance values of the undamped nodes, see Theorem
(4.10). Since the results show that the topology plays a major
role in determining GAS, an obvious topic for future research
is to ﬁnd sufﬁcient conditions purely based on the topology
of the graph. Such results can be helpful in e.g. the pinning
control problem, where one is looking for a strategy to place
a minimal number of damped nodes in order to ensure output
consensus.
