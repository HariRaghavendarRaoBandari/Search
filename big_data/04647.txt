We present a very simple device, inspired by computational ghost imaging, that allows the re-
trieval of a single non-reproducible, periodic or non-periodic, temporal signal. The reconstruction is
performed by a single shot, spatially multiplexed, measurement of the spatial intensity correlations
between computer-generated random images and the images modulated by the temporal signal,
recorded and summed on a chip CMOS camera used with no temporal resolution.

INTRODUCTION

Exploitation of the statistical properties of classical or non classical light sources is the cause of fascinating new
applications. For the two last decades, ghost imaging has emerged as a way to form images of an object with a
Single Point Detector (SPD) that does not have spatial resolution. The initial works used the quantum nature of
entanglement of a two-photons state, where photons of a pair are spatially correlated, to detect temporal coincidences
[1]. While one of the photons passing through the object was detected by a photon counter with no spatial resolution,
its twin photon was detected with spatial resolution by scanning the transverse plane with a single detector[1], or
recently by an intensiﬁed charge-coupled device (ICCD) [2].

Later, ghost imaging exploiting the temporal correlations of the intensity ﬂuctuations of pseudothermal light was
proposed. With a two-detector setup [3], a ghost image of the object was obtained by correlating the pseudothermal
ﬁeld measured by a CCD with the intensity measured with a SPD. More recently, computational ghost imaging and
ghost diﬀraction were performed with only one SPD [4, 5]: the object was illuminated by a pseudothermal light beam,
generated with a Spatial Light Modulator (SLM) addressed with random phase masks. Then, the transmitted light
was detected with the SPD. The image or the Fourier transform of the object was reconstructed by correlating the
temporal ﬂuctuations of the calculated ﬁeld patterns with the measured intensities. With the same principle, ghost
imaging with wavelength-multiplexing has been performed [6].

By taking into account space-time duality in optics, the extension of the results of spatial ghost imaging to the
time domain has been investigated theoretically, numerically and recently experimentally either with a classical non-
stationary light source [7, 8], bi-photon states [9], a chaotic laser [10] or a multimode laser source [11]. In all cases,
the light emitted by the sources was split into two arms, called ”reference” and ”test” arms. While in the test arm
the light was transmitted through a ”time object” and detected with a slow SPD which can not properly resolve
the time object, in the reference arm the light, that did not interact with the temporal object, was detected with
a fast SPD. As for spatial ghost imaging, the temporal object was reconstructed by measuring the correlations of
the temporal intensity ﬂuctuations or the temporal coincidences between the two arms. In [11], measurements over
several thousands copies of the temporal signal were necessary to retrieve an embedded binary signal with a good
signal-to-noise ratio [12].

The extension of spatial ghost imaging to the time domain looks attractive for dynamic imaging of ultra-fast
waveforms with high resolution. However, the currently proposed solutions require many realizations of the same
temporal signal, limiting the current applications to the detection of synchronized and reproducible signals [12]. This
is in contrast with spatial ghost imaging, where the object is unique, but multiplied in the time domain by a random
modulation, diﬀerent from one pixel to another, leading to multiplexing in this time domain. In the present paper
we propose an original and completely diﬀerent scheme which is the exact space-time transposition of computational
ghost imaging [5]: a single shot acquisition of a non-reproducible time object is performed by multiplying it with
computer-generated random images, ensuring spatial multiplexing of temporal intensity correlations before detection
of the time integrated images with a camera that has no temporal resolution.

FIG. 1: Experimental setup : (P) linear polarizer (WP) liquid crystal variable wave plate. Images of random patterns displayed
on a LCD screen are acquired with a CMOS camera. The transmission of the imaging system is modulated by a temporal
signal that drives the WP placed in front of the polarizer.

II. RESULTS

Fig. 1 depicts the set-up. First, a stack of K independent random binary patterns X, with a large number of
pixels, are generated and displayed on a LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) screen. In these binary patterns, a pixel takes
the value 1 with probability p and the value 0 with probability 1 − p, hence veriﬁes the statistical properties of a
Bernouilli distribution ((cid:104)X(cid:105) = p, σ2
X = p(1− p)). Images of the patterns are acquired with a compact CMOS USB2.0
camera (IDS UI-1640C, 1280×1024 pixels) on a 8 bits grey scale. Since the light emitted by the LCD screen is linearly
polarised at 45◦, the energy transmission of the imaging system can be linearly modulated by a temporal signal during
the exposure time of the camera, by means of a liquid crystal variable wave plate (WP, Thorlabs LCC1113-A) placed
before a linear polariser (P) in front of the camera objective.

At ﬁrst, each pattern Xk of the stack (k denotes the rank of the pattern in the stack) is recorded individually with
the same exposure time. The retardation of the WP and the direction of the polariser are adjusted to maximise the
energy transmission of the imaging system, that will be considered in the following as a level of 100% (T = 1). Then,
the mean and the variance of each image X(cid:48)
k are measured. Since the displayed patterns are binary, the sharp edges
of the original pixels are blurred in the recorded images because of the modulation transfer function (MTF) of the
objective. Consequently, as the recorded images are encoded over 255 grey levels, they do no longer verify the initial
statistical properties. Several experiments were conducted to optimize all the setup parameters (focus, numerical
aperture and magniﬁcation of the objective, number of independent pixels in patterns, probability p) such as the
statistical properties of intensity ﬂuctuations in the recorded images are the closest of those of the computed patterns
(see supplement).
In a second experiment, the patterns of the stack are displayed successively on the LCD screen, imaged with a
transmission coeﬃcient given by the driving temporal signal (0 ≤ T (t) ≤ 1), and summed on the camera during a
long exposure time (5 to 10 s). In that case, the recorded image S corresponds to the time integrated image of the
displayed patterns such as the level of a pixel Sij of coordinates (i, j) is given by :

K(cid:88)

Sij =

T (k)X(cid:48)

k,ij

(1)

k=1

where T (k) is the value of the transmission at the time when the kth pattern is displayed. Fig. 2 shows a selected
region of interest (ROI) in images of the displayed patterns. Fig. 2a corresponds to the image of a single pattern and
Fig. 2b corresponds to the image of the time integrated patterns of the stack where a temporal object is embedded.
Because the circular aperture of the WP limits the ﬁeld of view of the imaging system and induces deterministic
ﬂuctuations for pixels close to the border, we selected the larger ROI of N × N pixels (N = 700) in images where the
gray level of a lighted pixel is almost constant. In the subsequent calculations, residual covariances between images of
two independent binary patterns, due to these deterministic intensity ﬂuctuations, are removed by ﬁltering numerically
the recorded images. Because of the magniﬁcation of the imaging system, the image size of an independent pixel of
the displayed patterns is larger than the size of a pixel of the camera. Then, the number of eﬀective independent
pixels in an image is smaller than the number of pixels in the selected ROI.

As for other methods of ghost imaging, the temporal signal is reconstructed by calculating the intensity correlations
between the time integrated image S and the images X(cid:48) of the K random patterns. The value of T (k0) at the ”time”
k0 is estimated by (a hat means ”estimator of”):

are the arithmetic mean levels of the related images. γ is a normalization coeﬃcient corresponding
where S and X
to the ratio between the exposure time of the camera for the acquisition of the individual images X(cid:48)
k and the display
time of the random patterns during the acquisition of S. It can be shown (see supplement) that the noise in the
measurement is minimized when p = 0.5. Then, the signal-to-noise ratio (SN R) is given by:

ef f represents the total number of eﬀective independent pixels in recorded images. With a ROI of 700 × 700
where N 2
ef f has been estimated as 153 × 153 independent pixels. Fig. 3 shows ghost images of diﬀerent temporal
pixels, N 2
signals (analogic or binary and periodic or non periodic). Each ghost image corresponds to a single shot measurement
which is performed with images of 700× 700 pixels (where Nef f = 153), the same stack of 20 random patterns (where
p = 0.5) and a long camera exposure time between 6 s and 8 s. For periodic signals (ﬁgures 3a to Fig. 3c), the WP
controller is driven in a linear regime by 0.5 Hz periodic signals with diﬀerent shapes (square, sinus and ramp) which
are depicted by the green curves (only phases of these curves are adusted to ﬁt the experimental data represented
by the blue stars). Error bars are deduced from the measured SN R. Voltage amplitude of these signals are ﬁxed
such as the transmission of the imaging system is in the range 0.4 ≤ T (t) ≤ 0.9. These low and high transmission
levels are depicted in Fig. 3a-c by the horizontal black dotted lines. Fig. 3d corresponds to the ghost image of a
random binary word of 20 bits formed with a mechanical shutter ensuring T = 0 when closed, but T < 1 when open
because opening is not synchronized with the display of the random patterns on the LCD screen. These results clearly
show that our device is able to reconstruct, with a single shot measurement and with a very good accuracy, various
temporal analogic or binary signals. We emphasize that thanks to the single shot measurement, our device allows
non reproducible and non synchronizable signals to be recorded.

In order to measure the SN R, several single shot measurements were performed with the same experimental
parameters and the WP controller driven by diﬀerent continuous voltages such as the transmission coeﬃcient is set as
constants during the acquisition time of the ghost images (T =0.4, 0.9 and 1). The measured values are 0.38 ± 0.03,
0.90 ± 0.06 and 0.99 ± 0.08, respectively. Using Eq. 3, it corresponds to SN Rs of 26 ± 8, 28± 6 and 26 ± 8, which are
in rather good agreement with the theoretical SN R : 153√

III. CONCLUSION

To summarize, these experiments represent the ﬁrst demonstration of ghost imaging of a single, non-reproducible
time object. They are performed by multiplying this object with computer-generated random images, ensuring
the exact space-time transposition of computational ghost imaging. With a very simple device we were able to
reconstruct with a very good accuracy diﬀerent kinds of temporal signals. When compared to the recent experimental
demonstration of temporal ghost imaging [11], the main advantage of our system consists in no need of multiple
(thousands) synchronized copies of the temporal signal and the use of a single detector (the camera) that has no
temporal resolution. In the present form of the set-up, its obvious drawback is the slowness which was imposed by
the simple and low cost devices used to display the random patterns and to generate the temporal signals. The
generation rate of random patterns with a large number of independent spatial modes can be easily increased by using
either a fast digital micromirror device to display the random patterns up to tens of kHz [13] or spatial multiplexing
of modulated light sources in multimode ﬁbers to generate random patterns with a rate up to 100 M Hz. More
prospectively, exact space-time transposition of ghost imaging with thermal light [3] can be suggested where single
shot acquisition of a temporal signal with sub-picosecond resolution could be obtained. First, patterns due to fast
spatial ﬂuctuations of a thermal-like light source are divided in two arms with a beam splitter. In the ﬁst arm, spatial
ﬂuctuations of pattens are resolved with a high-speed photography device (a motion-picture camera with 4.4 × 1012
frames per second is reported in [14]), while in the second arm the same patterns are transmitted through a ”time
object” and integrated with a classical slow camera.
