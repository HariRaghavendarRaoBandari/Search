MODELING, DYNAMICS AND OPTIMAL CONTROL

OF EBOLA VIRUS SPREAD

AMIRA RACHAH AND DELFIM F. M. TORRES

Abstract. We present a mathematical analysis of the early detection
of Ebola virus. The propagation of the virus is analysed by using a Sus-
ceptible, Infected, Recovered (SIR) model. In order to provide useful
predictions about the potential transmission of the virus, we analyse and
simulate the SIR model with vital dynamics, by adding demographic ef-
fects and an induced death rate. Then, we compute the equilibria of the
model. The numerical simulations conﬁrm the theoretical analysis. Our
study describes the 2015 detection of Ebola virus in Guinea, the param-
eters of the model being identiﬁed from the World Health Organization
data. Finally, we consider an optimal control problem of the propaga-
tion of the Ebola virus, minimizing the number of infected individuals
while taking into account the cost of vaccination.

1. Introduction

Ebola virus is currently aﬀecting several African countries, mainly Guinea,
Sierra Leone, and Liberia. Ebola was ﬁrst discovered in 1976 in the Demo-
cratic Republic of the Congo near the Ebola River, where the disease takes
its name [5, 10, 19]. Since then, Ebola outbreaks have appeared sporadically
in Africa. The virus, previously known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever, is the
deadliest pathogens for humans. The early signs and symptoms of the virus
include a sudden onset of fever and intense weakness and headache. Over
time, symptoms become increasingly severe and include diarrhoea, raised
rash, internal and external bleed in (from nose, mouth, eyes and anus). As
the virus spreads through the body, it damages the immune system and or-
gans [18, 26, 29, 32, 34]. Ebola virus is transmitted to an initial human by
contact with an infected animal’s body ﬂuid. On the other hand, human-to-
human transmission can take place with direct contact (through broken skin
or mucous membranes in, for example, the eyes, nose, or mouth) with blood
or body ﬂuids of a person who is sick with or has died from Ebola. It is also

transmitted indirectly via exposure to objects or environment contaminated
with infected secretions [1, 8, 12, 21, 30].

Mathematical models are a powerful tool for investigating human infec-
tious diseases, such as Ebola, contributing to the understanding of the dy-
namics of the disease, providing useful predictions about the potential trans-
mission of the disease and the eﬀectiveness of possible control measures,
which can provide valuable information for public health policy makers
[11, 14, 27, 28]. Epidemic models date back to the early twentieth century,
to the 1927 work by Kermack and McKendrick, whose model was used for
modelling the plague and cholera epidemics. In fact, such epidemic models
have provided the foundation for the best vaccination practices for inﬂuenza
[20] and small pox [17]. Currently, the simplest and most commonly imple-
mented model in epidemiology is the SIR model. The SIR model consists
of three compartments: Susceptible individuals S, Infectious individuals I,
and Recovered individuals R [15]. When analysing a new outbreak, the re-
searchers usually start with the SIR model to ﬁt the available outbreak data
and obtaining estimates for the parameters of the model [9]. This has been
the case for the modelling of the spreading mechanism of the Ebola virus
currently aﬀecting several African countries [22, 23, 25]. For more complex
mathematical models, with more than three state variables, see [2, 3, 24].

In our previous works [22, 25], we used parameters identiﬁed from the
recent data of the World Health Organization (WHO) to describe the be-
haviour of the virus. Here we focus on the mathematical analysis of the early
detection of the Ebola virus. In Section 2, we brieﬂy recall the analysis study
of the SIR model that we presented in our previous study of the description
of the behaviour of Ebola virus [22, 23]. In Section 3, we add to the basic
model of Section 2 the demographic eﬀects, in order to provide a description
of the virus propagation closer to the reality. This gives answer to an open
question posed in Remark 1 of [24] and at the end of [3]. Our aim in study-
ing the model with vital dynamics is to provide useful predictions about
the potential transmission of the virus. We also consider an induced death
rate for the infected individuals. After numerical simulations, in Section 4
we control the propagation of the virus in order to minimize the number of
infected individuals and the cost of vaccination. We end with Section 5 of
conclusions.

2. Mathematical formulation for the basic SIR model

In this section, we present and brieﬂy discuss the properties of the sys-
tem of equations corresponding to the basic SIR (Susceptible–Infectious–
Recovery) model, which has recently been used in [22] to describe the early
detection of Ebola virus in West Africa.
In the formulation of the basic
SIR model, we assume that the population size is constant and any person
who has completely recovered from the virus acquired permanent immunity.
Moreover, we assume that the virus has a negligibly short incubation period,

MODELING, DYNAMICS AND OPTIMAL CONTROL OF EBOLA VIRUS SPREAD 3

so that an individual who contracts the virus becomes infective immediately
afterwards. These assumptions enables us to divide the host population into
three categories,

• S(t) for susceptible: denotes individuals who are susceptible to catch

the virus, and so might become infectious if exposed;

• I(t) for Infectious: denotes infectious individuals who are able to

spread the virus through contact with the susceptible category;

• R(t) for Recovered: denotes individuals who have immunity to the
infection, and consequently do not aﬀect the transmission dynamics
in any way when in contact with other individuals.

The model is described mathematically by the following system of non-linear
diﬀerential equations:

(2.1)

dS(t)

dt

dI(t)

dt

dR(t)

= −βS(t)I(t),

where β > 0 is the infection rate and µ > 0 is the recovered rate. The initial
conditions are given by

(2.2)

S(0) = S0 > 0,

I(0) = I0 > 0, R(0) = 0.

We can see that
is constant during the period under study:

d
dt

[S(t) + I(t) + R(t)] = 0, that is, the population size N

(2.3)

S(t) + I(t) + R(t) = N

for any t ≥ 0, which is far from the reality.

3. SIR model with vital dynamics and an induced death rate

In the basic SIR model (2.1), we ignore the demographic eﬀects on the
population. In this section, we study a variant of the basic model by consid-
ering vital dynamics, that is, by adding the birth and death rates into the
model. Moreover, we increase the death rate of the infectious class by con-
sidering an induced death rate associated to the infected individuals. Such
model is new in the Ebola context [22, 25, 33].

3.1. Model formulation. If we expand the SIR model (2.1) by including
the demographic eﬀects, assuming a constant rate of births ψ, an equal rate

of deaths γ per unit of time, and an induced death rate γI , then the mathe-
matical model is described by the following system of diﬀerential equations:

(3.1)

dS(t)

dt

dI(t)

dt

= ψN − βS(t)I(t) − γS(t),

= βS(t)I(t) − µI(t) − (γ + γI ) I(t),

= µI(t) − γR(t).

Figure 1 shows the compartment diagram of the SIR model (3.1) with vi-
tal dynamics, that is, with demographic (birth and death) eﬀects, and an
induced death rate.

with vital dynamics ψ and γ and an induced death rate γI .

3.2. Analysis of the equilibria. Firstly, we start by analysing the equa-
tions (3.1) of the model that serve as the basis for the propagation dynamics
of the Ebola virus with death and birth rates. As we shall see (cf. Theo-
rem 3.1), the dynamics are determined by the basic reproduction number

(3.3)

(3.4)

(3.5)

ψN − βSI − γS = 0,

βSI − µI − (γ + γI ) I = 0,

µI − γR = 0.

There are two biologically meaningful equilibrium points:
if I = 0, then
there is no disease for the population, and the equilibrium point is called a
disease-free equilibrium; otherwise, if I > 0, then the equilibrium point is
called endemic. By adding equations (3.3) and (3.4), we obtain that

ψN − γS − (µ + γ + γI )I = 0.

Then,

From (3.4) and (3.6), we get

I(cid:19) = 0.

Therefore, or I = 0 or

(3.7)

I =

β (µ + γ + γI )

.

If I = 0, then from (3.6) we obtain that S =

. It follows from (3.5) that

R = 0. We just proved that there is a virus free equilibrium E1 given by

(3.8)

t→∞

(S(t), I(t), R(t)) = (cid:18) ψN

γ

, 0, 0(cid:19) =: E1.

If (3.7) holds, then there is another equilibrium with

(3.9)

I ∗ =

βψN − γ (µ + γ + γI )

β (µ + γ + γI )

.

By substituting (3.9) into (3.6), we obtain that

(3.10)

S ∗ =

µ + γ + γI

and, using (3.5) in (3.6), we get

We just obtained the endemic equilibrium E2 given by

(3.12)

lim
t→∞

(S(t), I(t), R(t)) = (S ∗, I ∗, R∗) =: E2,

where the expressions of S ∗, I ∗ and R∗ are given by (3.9)–(3.11). Next result
summarizes what we have obtained so far.

Theorem 3.1. Let R0 be the basic reproduction number deﬁned by (3.2).

If R0 ≤ 1, then the disease free equilibrium E1 = (cid:18) ψN

γ

, 0, 0(cid:19) of the virus

is obtained, which corresponds to the case when the virus dies out (no epi-
demic). If R0 > 1, then the equilibrium E2 = (S ∗, I ∗, R∗) of the virus is
obtained, in agreement with expressions (3.9)–(3.11), and the virus is able
to invade the population (endemic equilibrium).

3.3. Simulation of the SIR model with demographic eﬀects and an
induced death rate. We now present a simulation of the model, taking
into account the real outbreak of Ebola virus occurred in Guinea in 2015
and by using the World Health Organization (WHO) data. Precisely, the
epidemic data used in our study is borrowed from the WHO web site [35].
The birth rate ψ = 0.03574 and death rate γ = 0.00946 of the model are
obtained from the speciﬁc statistical study of the demographic of Guinea in
2015 [31]. The parameters β, µ, γ and γI are obtained by identiﬁcation by
using the real data of WHO. To estimate the parameters of the model, we
adapted the initialisation of I with the reported data of WHO by ﬁtting the
real data of conﬁrmed cases of infectious in Guinea. The result of ﬁtting is
shown in Figure 2. The comparison between the curve of infectious obtained
by our simulation and the reported data of conﬁrmed cases by WHO shows
that the mathematical model (3.1) ﬁts well the real data by using β = 0.19
as the transmission rate, γ = 0.034 as the infectious rate, µ = 0.0447 as the
recovered rate, and γI = 0.0353 as the induced death rate. By comparing
the value of γI with the death rate γ, we remark that γI = 3.735γ. The
initial susceptible, infected and recovered populations, are given by

(3.13)

S(0) = 0.8387,

I(0) = 0.1613, R(0) = 0,

respectively. The choice of I(0) is in agreement with the data shown in
Figure 2 of the WHO data. By using the value of Guinea’s population,
which is estimated at P = 11780162 in 2015, and the number of conﬁrmed
infectious cases (obtained from WHO), the initialization of I(0) corresponds
to the number of infected divided by the total number of population. Then,
in reality, the initial number of infected, in the period between January 2015
and March 2015, is given by 0.1613 × P = 1900000, that is, the number
of conﬁrmed infectious cases represents 16.13% of the total of population.
Figure 2 presents the curve of infectious individuals I(t) simulated by using
(3.1) and obtained from the WHO real data. The evolution of susceptible,
infected and recovered groups over time, is shown in Figure 3. We also
studied numerically the equilibria, by solving numerically the SIR model
(3.1) with the same parameters and the same initialization. Figure 4a shows
the evolution of the susceptible individuals S(t) over time. We see that the
oscillations in the numbers of the three compartments damp out over time,
eventually reaching an equilibrium.
In our mathematical analysis of the
model, we found that the equilibrium S ∗ is computed theoretically by (3.10).
When we calculate the value of this theoretical result, we ﬁnd S ∗ = 0.47,
which is equal to the S ∗ computed by the numerical resolution of the model.
Figure 4b shows the evolution of the infected individuals I(t) over time. We
know that the equilibrium I ∗ is given by (3.9). When we calculate the value
of this theoretical result, we ﬁnd I ∗ = 0.34, which agrees with the value
computed by the numerical resolution of the model. Figure 4c shows the
evolution of the recovered individuals R(t) over time. The equilibrium R∗
is in this case computed theoretically by (3.11), which coincides the value

R∗ = 1.65 computed numerically. The fact that the reached equilibrium
(S ∗, I ∗, R∗) computed theoretically coincides with the value found by the
numerical simulation of the model, is a validation of our study of the SIR
model with vital dynamics and induced death rate, which describes well the
currently detection of Ebola virus in Guinea.

4. Optimal control of the virus under vital dynamics

Nowadays there are several trial vaccinations against Ebola. One was
already applied in Guinea and seems highly eﬀective [36]. In this section,
we present a strategy for the control of the virus, by introducing into the
model (3.1) a control u(t) representing the vaccination rate at time t. The
control u(t) is the fraction of susceptible individuals being vaccinated per
unit of time, taking values on the interval [0, 0.9]. Then, the mathematical
model with control is given by the following system of non-linear diﬀerential
equations:

The goal of the strategy is to reduce the infected individuals and the cost of
vaccination. Precisely, the optimal control problem consists of minimizing
the objective functional

where u is the control variable, u(t) ∈ [0, 0.9], which represents the vacci-
nation rate at time t, and the parameters τ and tend denote, respectively,
the weight on cost and the duration of the vaccination program.
In the
quadratic term of (4.2), τ is a positive weight parameter associated with
the control u(t) and the square of the control variable reﬂects the severity
of the side eﬀects of the vaccination. One has u ∈ Uad, where

Uad = {u : u is measurable, 0 ≤ u(t) ≤ umax < ∞, t ∈ [0, tend]}

is the admissible control set with umax = 0.9. The existence of an optimal
solution follows from Theorem 2.1 of [16] (see also the study of the spread
of inﬂuenza A (H1N1) [13] by using the SIR model).

In our study of the control of the virus, we use the parameters deﬁned in
Section 3.3. For the numerical simulations of the optimal control problem,
we have used the ACADO solver [4], which is based on a multiple shooting
method, including automatic diﬀerentiation and based ultimately on the
semidirect multiple shooting algorithm of Bock and Pitt [6]. The ACADO
solver comes as a self-contained public domain software environment, written
in C++, for automatic control and dynamic optimization. Because (4.1) is
a nonlinear control system, functional (4.2) is quadratic in the control and
linear in the phase variable I, it is not clear that the numerically found
solution through ACADO to our optimal control problem gives the global
minimum to the functional (4.2), or only a local one. Indeed, with ACADO

10

A. RACHAH AND D. F. M. TORRES

the optimal control problem is approximated by a ﬁnite dimensional opti-
mization problem, which is then solved by techniques from mathematical
programming. This only gives a candidate for local minimizer. Because of
this, we have also used a dynamic programming approach and checked our
results by solving it with BocopHJB, which is a C/C++ toolbox for optimal
control developed since 2014 in the framework of the Inria–Saclay initiative
for an open source optimal control toolbox, being supported by the team
“Commands” (see http://bocop.org). While ACADO implements a local
optimization method, the package BocopHJB implements a global optimiza-
tion method. Similarly to the dynamic programming approach, the optimal
control problem is solved by BocopHJB in two steps: ﬁrst the Hamilton–
Jacobi–Bellman equation satisﬁed by the value function of the problem is
solved; then the optimal trajectory is simulated from any chosen initial con-
dition [7]. The obtained results through BocopHJB are coincident with those
obtained through ACADO and, because of that, we claim to have found the
global minimum to the problem. Figure 5 shows the signiﬁcant diﬀerence
in the number of susceptible, recovered, and infected individuals with and
without control. In Figure 5a, we see that the number of susceptible S, in
case of optimal control, decreases faster during the vaccination campaign.
It reaches 34.78% at the end of the campaign against 44.12% in the absence
of optimal control. Figure 5b shows that the number of recovered individ-
uals increases rapidly. The number R(tend) increases more rapidly in case
of control than without control. In Figure 5c, the time-dependent curve of
infected individuals shows that the peak of the curve of infected individuals
is less important in case of control. In fact, the maximum value on the in-
fected curve I under optimal control is 16.3%, against 47.69% without any
control (see Figure 5c). The other important eﬀect of control, which we can
see in the same curve, is the period of infection, which is less important in
case of control of the virus. The value of the period of infection is 46 days
in case of optimal control, versus more than 60 days without vaccination.
This shows the eﬃciency of vaccination in controlling Ebola.
In conclusion,
one can say that Figure 5 shows the eﬀectiveness of optimal vaccination in
controlling Ebola. Figure 6 gives a representation of the optimal control
u(t); while Figure 7 shows the evolution of the number of total population
N (t) = S(t) + I(t) + R(t) over time. We see that the total number of
population is bigger in case of vaccination (less people dying).

5. Conclusion

Mathematical modelling of the detection of a virulent virus such Ebola
is a powerful tool to understand the dynamics of the propagation of the
virus in a population. The main aim is to provide useful predictions about
the potential transmission of the virus. The important step after modelling
is to study the properties of the system of equations that describes the

adding demographic eﬀects and an induced death rate, in order to discuss
when the model makes sense mathematically and to study the information
provided by the model. We simulated the model in the case of a basic
reproduction number R0 > 1, which describes the current situation of Ebola
virus in Guinea. We studied the equilibria. The system of equations of the
model was solved numerically and the numerical simulations conﬁrmed the
theoretical analysis of the equilibria for the model. Finally, we controlled the
propagation of the virus by minimizing the number of infected individuals
and the cost of vaccination and showing the importance of optimal control.
