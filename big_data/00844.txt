Quantum point contacts (QPCs) are cor-
nerstones of mesoscopic physics and central
building blocks for quantum electronics. Al-
though the Fermi wavelength in high-quality bulk
graphene can be tuned up to hundreds of nanome-
ters, the observation of quantum conﬁnement
of Dirac electrons in nanostructured graphene
systems has proven surprisingly challenging.
Here we show ballistic transport and quantized
conductance of size-conﬁned Dirac fermions in
lithographically-deﬁned graphene constrictions.
At high charge carrier densities, the observed
conductance agrees excellently with the Landauer
theory of ballistic transport without any ad-
justable parameter. Experimental data and simu-
lations for the evolution of the conductance with
magnetic ﬁeld unambiguously conﬁrm the iden-
tiﬁcation of size quantization in the constriction.
Close to the charge neutrality point, bias voltage
spectroscopy reveals a renormalized Fermi veloc-
ity (vF ≈ 1.5 × 106 m/s) in our graphene constric-
tions. Moreover, at low carrier density transport
measurements allow probing the density of local-
ized states at edges, thus oﬀering a unique handle
on edge physics in graphene devices.

The observation of unique transport phenomena in
graphene, such as Klein tunneling1, evanescent wave
transport2, or the half-integer3,4 and fractional5,6 quan-
tum Hall eﬀect are directly related to the material quality
as well as the relativistic dispersion of the charge carri-
ers. As the quality of bulk graphene has been impres-
sively improved in the last years7,8, the understanding
of the role and limitations of edges on transport prop-
erties of graphene is becoming increasingly important.
This is particularly true for nanoscale graphene systems
where edges can dominate device properties. Indeed, the
rough edges of graphene nanodevices are most proba-
bly responsible for the diﬃculties in observing clear con-
ﬁnement induced quantization eﬀects, such as quantized
conductance9 and shell ﬁlling10. So far signatures of
quantized conductance have only been observed in sus-
pended graphene, however with limited control and in-
formation on geometry and constriction width11. More
generally, with further progress in fabrication technology,
graphene nanoribbons and constrictions are expected to

evolve from a disorder dominated12–15 transport behavior
to a quasi-ballistic regime where boundary eﬀects, crys-
tal alignment, and edge defects16,17 govern the transport
characteristics. This will open the door to investigate in-
teresting phenomena arising from edge states, including
magnetic order at zig-zag edges18, an unusual Josephson
eﬀect, unconventional edge states20, magnetic edge-state
excitons21 or topologically protected quantum spin Hall
states22.

In this work we report on the observation of quan-
tum conﬁnement and edge states in ballistic transport
through graphene constrictions approximating quantum
point contacts. We prepared 4-probe devices based on
high-mobility graphene-hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)
sandwiches on SiO2/Si substrates and use reactive ion
etching to pattern narrow constrictions (see Methods)
with widths ranging from W ≈ 230 to 850 nm, con-
necting wide leads (Figs. 1a-1c). The graphene leads
are side-contacted8 by chrome/gold electrodes. A back
gate voltage is applied on the highly doped Si sub-
strate to tune the carrier density in the graphene layer,
n = α(Vg − V 0
g ) = α∆Vg, where α is the so-called lever
arm and V 0
g is the gate voltage of the minimum conduc-
tance, i.e. the charge neutrality point. To demonstrate
the high electronic quality of our graphene-hBN sandwich
structures we show the gate characteristic of a reference
Hall bar device (Fig. 1d). From this data we extract a
carrier mobility in the range of around 150.000 cm2/Vs
(see Supplementary Note 1), resulting in a mean free path
exceeding 1 µm at around ∆Vg = 4.6 V. Thus, the mean
free path is expected to clearly exceed all relevant length
scales in our constriction devices giving rise to ballistic
transport.

to a value below 1 due to limited average transmission,
and higher Fourier components cj are expected to de-
cay in magnitude and acquire random scattering phases
φj (cid:54)= 0. Consequently, the sharp quantization steps turn
into periodic modulations as will be shown below. Aver-
aged over these modulations only the zeroth order term
in the expansion [Eq. (2)] survives. This mean conduc-
tance G(0) of a constriction of width W thus features a
linear dependence on kF, or, equivalently, a square-root
dependence as a function of back-gate voltage assuming
an energy-independent transmission c0 of all modes, in
accord with Fig. 1d. By measuring the carrier density de-
pendent quantum Hall eﬀect at high magnetic ﬁelds24,25,
we can independently determine the gate coupling α for
each device (see Supplementary Note 2). We can thus
unfold the dependence on Vg and study both the elec-
tron and hole conductance as function of kF (Fig. 1e).

extracted for each device and compared to its width W
(Fig. 1f) determined from scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images (see, e.g., Fig. 1b). The estimates for c0W
extracted from G(0) lie just little below the width W ,
where c0 decreases for decreasing width. This suggests
that for the narrower devices reﬂections, most likely due
to device geometry and edge roughness, are playing a
more important role. From the data in Fig. 1f we can
extract c0 ≈ 0.56 for our smallest constriction. Below
we will show that, indeed, reﬂections at the rough edges
of the constriction and not a reduction in active channel
width is responsible for the deviation of the experimen-
tally extracted c0W from the SEM width W .

Localized states at the edges.

For small kF < 50 × 106 m−1 (i.e.

low carrier con-
centrations) the measured conductances systematically
deviate from the expected linear behavior (see Fig. 1e).

This deviation from the square-root relation between G
and n (i.e. ∆Vg) becomes more apparent when focusing
on G around the charge neutrality point (CNP). The con-
ductance as function of n for two diﬀerent cool-downs of
the same graphene constriction (W ≈ 230 nm, Fig. 2a),
regions with substantial deviations from G ∝ √
shows marked cool-down dependent low carrier density
n. Far
away from the CNP, the conductance as function of n for
both cool-downs shows (i) an identical
n behavior lead-
ing to the very same c0W and (ii) almost identical, regu-
larly spaced kink structures (see arrows in Fig. 2a), which
are, however, slightly shifted relative to another on the
carrier density axis n. These observations suggest that
the square-root relation between the Fermi wave vector
kF and the gate voltage Vg, i.e. n needs to be modiﬁed.
While the quantum capacitance of ideal graphene can be
neglected26–28, a small additional contribution nT (∆Vg)
from, e.g., localized trap states modiﬁes the relation be-
tween n and kF to

the expected square root relation. Close to the Dirac
point, however, α∆Vg will be strongly modiﬁed by devi-
ations nT from the linear density of states of ideal Dirac
fermions and approaches nT (∆Vg) near the CNP.

The trap states do not contribute to transport, yet they
contribute to the charging characteristics30. It is impor-
tant to note that electron-hole puddles29 or charged im-
purities would only smear out the density of states but
would not add additional trap-state density nT . This
is in contrast to graphene edges,
in particular rough
graphene edges, which feature a signiﬁcant number of
trap states. For example, a tight-binding simulation of
the local density of states of the experimental geometry
yields a strong clustering of localized states at the device
edges (see Fig. 2c), which energetically lie close to the

√

CNP (Fig. 2e). The deviation of G from the
n scal-
ing also opens up the opportunity to extract nT from
experimental conductance data (e.g. Fig. 2d), and thus
a new pathway for device characterization. Inspired by
the tight-binding simulation, we approximate the trap
state density nT as function of Fermi wave vector by a
Gaussian distribution. We ﬁt the position, height and
width of the Gaussian by minimizing the diﬀerence be-
tween the measured G(kF) and the corresponding lin-
ear extrapolation to very low values of kF (see Fig. 2b
and Supplementary Note 3). We ﬁnd good qualitative
agreement between simulation and experiment (compare
Figs. 2d and 2e). Quantitative correspondence would re-
quire a detailed, microscopic model for the trap state
density nT . Note that the only diﬀerence between dif-
ferent traces in Figs. 2a, 2b and 2d is the exposition of

constriction geometry taken from a SEM image, scaled
down by a factor of four to obtain a numerically feasi-
ble problem size7. To account for the etched edges in
the devices, we include an edge roughness amplitude of
∆W = 0.2W for the constriction. This comparatively
large edge roughness (which is consistent with the sys-
tematic reduction of transmission through the constric-
tion when using the average conductance) is probably
due to microcracks at the edges of the device.

Quantized conductance.

Superimposed on the overall linear behavior of G(kF),
we ﬁnd reproducible modulations (“kinks”) in the con-
ductance (see Figs. 3a-3c and Fig. S4b). The kinks are
well reproduced for several cool downs (see arrows in
Fig. 2a and Supplementary Note 4) as well as for dif-
ferent devices, generally showing a spacing ∆G varying
in the range of (2 − 4)e2/h (see arrows in Figs. 3b and
3c). The “step height” and its sharpness depend on the
carrier density (i.e. kF ) as well as on the constriction
width and is strongly inﬂuenced by the overall transmis-
sion c0 (Fig. 1f). Remarkably, we observe a spacing ∆G
of the steps close to 4e2/h for one of our wide samples (W
≈ 310 nm) at elevated conductance values on both the
electron and hole sides (see arrows and horizontal lines
in Fig. 3c and Fig. S4b)

Our assignment of the conductance “kinks” as signa-
tures of quantized ﬂow through the constriction is sup-
ported by our theoretical results. Theory and experi-
mental data from the smallest constriction show similar
smoothed, irregular modulations (see Fig. 3a), instead of
sharp size quantization steps.33 The replacement of sharp
quantization steps by kinks reﬂects the strong scattering
at the rough edges of the device34,35, resulting in the ac-
cumulation of random phases in the Fourier components
of G [Eq. (2)]. We note that calculations with smaller
edge disorder show a larger average conductance, yet
very similar “kink” structures. As the present calcula-
tion includes only edge-disorder induced scattering while
neglecting other scattering channels such as electron-
electron or electron-phonon scattering, the good agree-
ment with the data suggests edge scattering to be the
dominant contribution to the formation of the “kinks”.
By contrast, both experimental and theoretical investi-
gations of, e.g., semiconducting GaAs heterostructures
show very clear, pronounced quantization plateaus36. In
these heterostructures, the electron wave length near the
Γ point is very long, and cannot resolve edge disorder
on the nanometer scale. By contrast, K-K(cid:48) scattering
in graphene allows conduction electrons to probe disor-
der on a much shorter length scale. Consequently, edge
roughness substantially impacts transport. The compar-
ison between experimental and theoretical data (Fig. 3a)
unambiguously establishes the observed modulations to
be consistent with the smoothed size quantization eﬀects
predicted by theory.

observed in panel a (see also Supplementary Note 6). c, Con-

rier density region of substantial deviations (green trace).
The number of trap states (i.e., the deviations around the
CNP) is signiﬁcantly enhanced (compare also green and
black trace in Fig. 2d). As the active graphene layer is
completely sandwiched in hBN only the graphene edges
are exposed to air and, very likely, experience chemical
modiﬁcations. In line with our numerical results, we thus
conjecture that localized states at the edges substantially
contribute to nT , leading to the strong cool-down de-
pendence we observe in our measurements. While this
interpretation seems plausible and is consistent with our
data, alternative explanations cannot be ruled out.

Away from the CNP our data agrees remarkably well
with ballistic transport simulations through the device
geometry using a modular Green’s function approach8
(see blue trace in Fig. 2b): we simulate the 4-probe

By subtracting the zeroth-order Fourier component
∝ kF (or
n), the superimposed modulations of the con-
ductance δG(kF) = G − G(0) provide direct information
on the quantized conductance through the constriction
[Eq. (2)]. One key observation is that the Fourier trans-
form of δG(kF) oﬀers an alternative route towards the
determination of the constriction width complementary
to that from the mean conductance G(0). For example,
the pronounced peak of the ﬁrst harmonic at 230 nm
(red arrows in Figs. 3d and 3e) is consistent with the
constriction width W derived from the SEM image. In-
terestingly, our simulation also correctly reproduces the
experimental observation that the peak in the Fourier
spectrum of δG(kF) is more pronounced on the electron
side (Fig. 3d) than on the hole side. This results from
the slightly asymmetric energy distribution of the trap
states relative to the CNP, which is accounted for in our
tight-binding calculation.

Performing such a Fourier analysis for several devices
(Supplementary Note 5) yields much closer agreement

with the geometric width W (Fig. 3f and horizontal axis
of Fig. 1f) than an estimate based only on the zeroth-
order Fourier component c0W [ﬁrst term in Eq. (2), see
vertical axis of Fig. 1f]. Fourier spectroscopy of con-
ductance modulations thus allows to disentangle reduced
transmission due to scattering at the edges (˜c0W ) from
the eﬀective width of the constriction, and proves the re-
lation between the observed Fourier periodicity and the
device geometry.

Bias voltage spectroscopy measurements yield an es-
timate for the energy scale of the size quantization
steps11,37. For example, by analyzing ﬁnite bias measure-
ments from our smallest constriction device we extract a
subband energy spacing of ∆E = 13.5 ± 2 meV near the
CNP (Figs. 4a, 4b and Supplementary Note 6). With the
geometric width of 230 nm also conﬁrmed by the Fourier
spectroscopy (Fig. 3c) we can estimate the Fermi velocity
near the CNP as vF = 2W ∆E/h = (1.5± 0.2)× 106 m/s.
This is a clear signature of a substantially renormal-
ized Fermi velocity in nanostructured graphene, possibly

Transition from quantized conductance to quantum

Hall.

√

Additional clear ﬁngerprints of size quantization ap-
pear in the parametric evolution of the conductance
steps39 with magnetic ﬁeld, B. The transition from size
quantization at zero B-ﬁeld to Landau quantization at
high magnetic ﬁelds occurs when the cyclotron radius
lC becomes smaller than half the constriction width W .
For the Landau level m the transition should occur at
2m lB ≈ W with lB the magnetic length. This
2 lC = 2
transition line in the B− n plane (see black dashed curve
in Fig. 5a) agrees well with the onset of Landau level
formation in our data (see Supplementary Note 8 for
similar data from a 280 nm constriction device). The
evolution of the lowest quantized steps (at B = 0 T)
to the corresponding lowest Landau levels at low tem-
peratures (T=1.7 K) can be easily tracked (see Figs. 5b
and 5c). At higher temperatures (T = 6 K) the evolu-
tion of quantized sub-bands to Landau levels is observed
even for higher conductance plateaus (Fig. 5d, 5e). For a
comparison, we calculate the evolution of size quantiza-
tion of an inﬁnitely long ribbon of width W as function
of magnetic ﬁeld. We take W ≈ 230 nm from the SEM
data, which leaves no adjustable parameters. Our model
( black lines in Figs. 5e and 5f) reproduces the evolution
from the kinks at small ﬁelds (lB (cid:29) W ) to the Landau
levels for large ﬁelds (lB < W ) remarkably well, further
supporting the notion that they are, indeed, signature of
size quantization.

DISCUSSION

We have shown ballistic conductance of conﬁned Dirac
fermions in high-mobility graphene nanoconstrictions

7

sandwiched by hexagonal boron nitride. Away from the
Dirac point, we observe a linear increase in conductance
as function of Fermi wavevector with a slope propor-
tional to constriction width. Close to the Dirac point,
the charging of localized edge states distorts this linear
relation. Superimposed on the linear conductance, we ob-
serve reproducible, evenly spaced modulations (“kinks”).
Tight-binding simulations for the device reproduce these
structures related to size quantization at the constric-
tion. We can unambiguously identify these “kinks” as
size quantization signatures by both Fourier spectroscopy

METHODS

Experimental methods and details

The hBN-graphene-hBN sandwich structures8 have been etched
by reactive ion etching in a SF6 atmosphere, prior deposition of
a ∼ 10 nm-thick Cr etching mask. Remaining rests of Cr oxide
are removed by immersing the samples in a Tetramethylammo-
nium hydroxide (TMAH) solution for about 30-35 s. All transport
measurements are performed in a 4-probe conﬁguration using stan-
dard lock-in techniques. Since the distances between the contacted
current-carrying electrodes and the voltage probes are small, com-
pared to the other length scales of the system, we have an eﬀective
2-probe conﬁguration. Importantly, this way we exclude the one-
dimensional contact resistances.

Electrostatic simulations and transport calculations

We simulate the experimental device geometry using a third-
nearest neighbor tight-binding ansatz. We rescale our device by a
factor of four compared to experiment, to arrive at a numerically
feasible geometry. We determine the Green’s function using the
modular recursive Green’s function method8,9. The local density
of states and transport properties can then be extracted by suitable
projections on the Green’s function. For more technical details see
Supplementary Note 9.

Supplementary Note 1. Sample quality

The ﬁeld-eﬀect carrier mobility in our sandwich devices is on the order of 150.000 cm2/Vs. This high sample quality
is thanks to advances in sample fabrication, in particular the van-der-Waals stacking process: the graphene is fully
encapsulated in hBN, resulting in signiﬁcantly improved sample quality. We extract the mobility from a one µm-wide
Hall bar device fabricated in the very same batch as our graphene constrictions (see Fig. S1). The dark blue trace in
Fig. 1d of the main manuscript is taken from this Hall bar device. As all traces from the constrictions with diﬀerent
widths (some of them carved out from the same hBN-graphene-hBN sandwich) lie systematically below the Hall bar
trace, we exclude bulk scattering as limiting process in our devices.
Independently, we have shown recently in a
collaboration with A. Morpurgo, F. Guinea and coworkers1 that in our high-quality devices the carrier mobility is not
limited by charge impurity and short-range scattering but rather by nanometer-scale strain variations giving rise to
long-range scattering with allowed pseudospin ﬂips. We expect that the same limitations on the mean free path also
apply to our graphene constriction devices.

inset shows the four-terminal resistivity as a function of gate voltage at lower temperature (1.7 K).

Supplementary Note 2. Extraction of the gate lever arm α

Measurements of Landau levels in graphene as a function of back gate voltage Vg and magnetic ﬁeld B (see Fig. S2)
allow for an independent determination of the gate coupling (or lever arm) α. The Landau level spectrum for massless
Dirac fermions in graphene is given by

where vF is the Fermi velocity and m is the quantum number of the corresponding Landau level. Assuming a perfect
linear dispersion and a constant capacitive gate coupling leads to the following relation between energy E and back
gate voltage

(S2)

where ∆Vg = Vg − V 0
g is the gate voltage at the charge neutrality point. As a result, the Landau levels in
the B - Vg plane form straight lines, i.e. Bm = Cm∆Vg, where the slope Cm = αh/4me is Landau level index (m)
dependent and proportional to the capacitive coupling α (see red lines in Fig. S2a-e).

g , and V 0

The onset of each Landau level can be resolved by taking the mixed second derivative of the longitudinal conductance
G with respect to Vg and B, i.e. ∂2G/∂Vg∂B. The positions of the Landau levels coincide with the minima/maxima
of the derivative on the electron/hole side (see Fig. S2a-e, where the local minima/maxima coincide with red lines).
Alternatively, the Landau levels can be determined from the minima of the longitudinal resistivity ρ (marked in
white in Fig. S2f). Note that Cm is independent of the Fermi velocity, experimental determination of which is rather
diﬃcult. Table S1 summarizes the extracted values of α for the diﬀerent devices.

A closer look at the traces from two diﬀerent cool-downs of the narrowest device with W = 230 nm (Figs. S3a
and S3c) reveals a systematical deviation from the expected square-root dependence of G [Eq. (S3)] at low carrier
concentrations, i.e for n < 0.45× 1012 cm−2 on the electron side and n < 0.75× 1012 cm−2 on the hole side (Fig. S3a).
This deviation becomes more pronounced closer to the charge neutrality point (see shaded area in Figs. S3a and S3c).
In the ballistic region, i.e., far from the charge neutrality point, we can use Eq. (S3), with α extracted from the Landau
level fan, and ﬁt parameters V 0,e
for the hole (h) side. As expected, the conductance
G evolves linearly as function of kF in the ballistic regime (see red traces in Figs. S3b and S3d), but large deviations
between data and model become apparent close to the charge neutrality point. We conclude that a linear model using

F π−1 + nT (∆Vg) .

(S4)

Using Eq. S4, we obtain an implicit mapping kF(∆Vg), which depends on the functional form of nT (∆Vg) and accounts
for the modiﬁed density of states in the constriction,

(cid:113)

kF(∆Vg) =

πα∆Vg − πnT (∆Vg).

(S5)

We conjecture that the strong cool-down dependence seen in the diﬀerent traces of Fig. S3 are due to modiﬁcations in
the trap state densities as the sample was exposed to air2. As the graphene layer in our hBN-graphene-hBN sandwich
can only interact with air at the edges, edge states presumably strongly contribute to nT .
Indeed, tight-binding
simulations of the constriction geometry (see main text, Fig. 2c,e) yield a clustering of localized edge states close to
the Dirac point. Accounting for nT by Eq. (S5) should recover the linear relation between Fermi wave number and
conductance. We can thus determine nT from the measured conductance: we assume a Gaussian distribution of trap
states nT , and ﬁt the width, position and height of the Gaussian distribution by minimizing deviations of the rescaled
conductance G[(kF(∆Vg)] from the linear conductance G(0)(kF) of Eq. (S3), see green/black traces in Figs. S3b and
S3d. Note that this procedure assumes that any other sources for a deviation from a linear relation between kF and
G (due to, e.g., many-body eﬀects) are small compared to the contribution from trap states nT .

Supplementary Note 4. Reproducibility of kink signatures

We ﬁnd regular kink structures in the conductance trace of our constriction devices (see, e.g., arrows in Fig. S4b).
These kinks are well reproducible for diﬀerent cool-downs of the same device (see Figs. S5, S6), and appear in

where M = 0,±1,±2, . . . is an integer associated with the subband index (both signs emerge due to the presence of
two cones), and 0 ≤ |β| < 0.5 is a Maslov index related to the boundary conditions at the edges (for simplicity we
use β = 0, i.e. a zigzag ribbon). Within the energy range where the ballistic model (see red trace in Fig. S8) ﬁts
the conductance trace, the theoretical position of the subbands (marked by vertical black dashed lines in Fig. S8)
for a 230 nm-wide graphene constriction (V M
g = πM 2/αW 2, M = 1, 2, . . .) are in good agreement with the kinks
in the conductance (see Fig. S8a). The agreement between model and data is also visible in the derivative of the
conductance ∂G/∂Vg (see Fig. S8b). Close to the charge neutrality point though, the kink signatures do not appear to
follow the theoretical position of the subbands (vertical black dashed lines in Fig. S8a,b). Upon rescaling kF according
to Eq. (S5) (independently determined from the average transmission), the kinks are shifted, in good agreement with
the quantization model (see comparison between dashed vertical lines and the position of the kinks in Fig. S8c,d).
In summary, we ﬁnd that the rescaling according to Eq. (S5) will (i) realign similar, reproducible kink-structures of
diﬀerent cool-downs on the kF axis and (ii) shifts the kink positions to ﬁt the simple quantization model of Eq. (S6).

bacSupplementary Note 5. Fourier spectroscopy of transmission data

Once the conductance is represented as a function of kF , the Fourier transform of δG(kF) oﬀers alternative infor-
mation on the quantized conductance through the constriction. If the regular kinks we identify in our conductance
data, indeed, correspond to size quantization signatures, we can extract the constriction width from the ﬁrst peak
of the Fourier transform. Comparison between the ﬁrst peak in the Fourier transform of the measured conductance
G(kF) − G(0)(kF) of four constriction devices (see Fig. S9 and Fig. 4 in the main text) to the geometric width W of
the constriction, yields good agreement (see also Fig. 3f of the main text).

Bias spectroscopy

20

Using bias spectroscopy we can extract the energy scale associated with the regular kink pattern. The diﬀerential
conductance g = dI/dV = ISD/VSD (Fig. 4, Fig. S10 and Fig. S11) is measured from an AC excitation voltage
VAC = 250 µVP P , using standard Lock-In techniques. We analyze six diamonds associated with kinks at the low-
and high-conductance ranges (see Fig. S10). Extraction of the energy scale from the derivative of the diﬀerential
conductance (color panels) yields ∆E = 13.5 ± 2 meV leading to vF = (1.5 ± 0.2) × 106 m/s. Variations in the
data are due to temperature eﬀects, potential variations and uncertainties in determining the exact extensions of the
diamonds. All six extracted diamonds are taken from energy regions where size quantization signatures are clearly
visible and reproducible - we are thus conﬁdent that the sample is in the quantum point contact regime for all six
diamonds. Note that modiﬁcations of the gate-lever arm do not aﬀect the bias spectroscopy data since all energy
scales are extracted from the bias voltage axis (Vb), which represents a direct energy-scale.
We extract similar values of subband spacing (∆E ≈ 13.5 ± 2 and 13.5 ± 3 meV ) in a second (Fig. 4b of the main
text and Fig. S10c) and a third (Fig. 4a of the main text and Fig. S11) cool-down of the same device. The value
of subband spacing is additionally conﬁrmed at ﬁnite magnetic ﬁeld (Fig. S11c). We note that, at B = 140 mT,
the quantized subbands are still caused by geometric conﬁnement rather than magnetic conﬁnement (i.e., due to the
quantum Hall eﬀect).

Moreover, half-conductance kinks3,4 are expected to emerge for a bias window e Vb greater than the subband spacing.
Indeed, additional kinks at intermediate values of conductance are observed (horizontal dashed blue lines in Fig. S10c
and red arrows in Fig. S11b,c). The observation of these intermediate kinks conﬁrms the conﬁnement nature of the
observed kinks in conductance3,5,6.

To check against any spurious contribution from the AC measurement technique, the bias spectroscopy measure-
ments have been repeated in a DC conﬁguration (Fig. S12). The conductance G = I/V = I DC/Vb is obtained from a
symmetrically applied source-drain DC bias voltage Vb. Although the resolution of the DC conductance G (Fig. S12)
is not suﬃcient to extract the subband spacing ∆E, the conductance kinks are still visible at identical values of
conductance as in the AC measurements (Fig. S11).

the diﬀerential conductance g measured at Vb = 15 mV (see blue arrow in lower colored panel). The horizontal dashed blue lines
highlight the levels of conductance of the intermediate kinks, visible (blue conductance trace) for energies above the subband
spacing, e.g. E ≈ 15 meV > ∆E (blue arrow in lower colored panel).

Supplementary Note 8. Evolution of size quantization with magnetic ﬁeld

We provide an additional data set for the magnetic-ﬁeld evolution of the size quantization signatures from the
280 nm-wide graphene constriction in Fig. S15. We ﬁnd the same transition from size-quantization signatures, at low
magnetic ﬁelds, to the Landau level regime, at high magnetic ﬁelds, as in the sample discussed in the main text (see
Fig. 5 of main manuscript).

Supplementary Note 9. Theoretical treatment

We use a third nearest neighbor tight-binding approach to simulate the constriction. We pattern the device edge
using the experimental geometry determined from SEM, and a correlated random ﬂuctuation to simulate microscopic
roughness. We rescale our device by a factor of four compared to the experiment, to arrive at a numerically feasible
system size. Such a rescaling by a factor of four ensures that all relevant length scales of the problem (e.g., device
geometry, Fermi wavelength, magnetic length and correlation length of the edge roughness) are still much larger than
the discretization length of the numerical graphene lattice, allowing to extrapolate simulation data to the experimental
result7. We use a correlation length of 5 nm and an average disorder amplitude of 13 nm. We determine the Green’s
function, G(r, r(cid:48)), of the device using the modular recursive Green’s function method8,9. The local density of states,
ρ(r, E), is given by ρ(r, E) ∝ Im[G(r, r; E)]. Calculations were performed on the Vienna Scientiﬁc Cluster 3. To
determine the transport properties of the device, we attach two leads of width D on each side of the experimental
contact regions, and calculate the total transmission. To avoid residual eﬀects due to the ﬁxed lead width used in the
computation, we average over ﬁve diﬀerent randomly chosen lead widths D ∈ [60, 80] nm.

To determine the evolution of subbands in a constriction of width W with magnetic ﬁeld, we calculate the band
structure of a perfect zigzag graphene nanoribbon of width W as a function of magnetic ﬁeld. We include the
magnetic ﬁeld via a Peierls phase factor. The subband positions are extracted from the minima of each band in the
bandstructure of the ribbon.
