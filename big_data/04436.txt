Abstract

We make precise determinations of the leading scaling dimensions and operator
product expansion (OPE) coeﬃcients in the 3d Ising, O(2), and O(3) models from the
conformal bootstrap with mixed correlators. We improve on previous studies by scan-
ning over possible relative values of the leading OPE coeﬃcients, which incorporates
the physical information that there is only a single operator at a given scaling dimen-
sion. The scaling dimensions and OPE coeﬃcients obtained for the 3d Ising model,
(∆σ, ∆, λσσ, λ) = (0.5181489(10), 1.412625(10), 1.0518537(41), 1.532435(19)), give
the most precise determinations of these quantities to date.

Introduction

The conformal bootstrap [1, 2] in d > 2 has recently seen an explosion of exciting and
nontrivial results, opening the door to the possibility of a precise numerical classiﬁcation of
non-perturbative conformal ﬁeld theories (CFTs) with a small number of relevant operators.
Such a classiﬁcation would lead to a revolution in our understanding of quantum ﬁeld theory,
with direct relevance to critical phenomena in statistical and condensed matter systems,
proposals for physics beyond the standard model, and quantum gravity.

One of the most striking successes has been in its application to the 3d Ising model,
In [5] we found that the conformal bootstrap applied to a system of
initiated in [3, 4].
correlators {(cid:104)σσσσ(cid:105),(cid:104)σσ(cid:105),(cid:104)(cid:105)} containing the leading Z2-odd scalar σ and leading Z2-
even scalar  led to a small isolated allowed region for the scaling dimensions (∆σ, ∆).
In [6] this approach was pushed farther using the semideﬁnite program solver SDPB, lead-
ing to extremely precise determinations of the scaling dimensions and associated critical
exponents.1

In [9] we found that this approach could also be extended to obtain rigorous isolated
regions for the whole sequence of 3d O(N ) vector models, building on the earlier results
of [10, 11]. While the resulting “O(N ) archipelago” is not yet as precise as in the case of the
Ising model, it serves as a concrete example of how the bootstrap can lead to a numerical
classiﬁcation – if we can isolate every CFT in this manner and make the islands suﬃciently
small, then we have a precise and predictive framework for understanding the space of non-
perturbative conformal ﬁxed points. If the methods can be made more eﬃcient, it is clear
that this approach may lead to solutions of longstanding problems such as determining the
conformal windows of 3d QED and 4d QCD.

Compared to previous mixed-correlator studies [5, 6, 9] (see also [12–14]), the novelty of
the present work is the idea of disallowing degeneracies in the CFT spectrum by making ex-
clusion plots in the space of OPE coeﬃcients and dimensions simultaneously. For example, in
the 3d Ising model, by scanning over possible values of the ratio λ/λσσ, we can impose that
there is a unique  operator. This leads to a three-dimensional island in (∆σ, ∆, λ/λσσ)
space whose projection to the (∆σ, ∆) plane is much smaller than the island obtained
without doing the scan. For each point in this island, we also bound the OPE coeﬃcient
magnitude λσσ. The result is a new determination of the leading scaling dimensions
(∆σ, ∆) = (0.5181489(10), 1.412625(10)), shown in ﬁgure 1, as well as precise determi-
nations of the leading OPE coeﬃcients (λσσ, λ) = (1.0518537(41), 1.532435(19)). These
scaling dimensions translate to the critical exponents (η, ν) = (0.0362978(20), 0.629971(4)).

We repeat this procedure for 3d CFTs with O(2) and O(3) global symmetry, focusing
on the bootstrap constraints from the correlators {(cid:104)φφφφ(cid:105),(cid:104)φφss(cid:105),(cid:104)ssss(cid:105)} containing the
leading vector φi and singlet s. We again ﬁnd that scanning over the ratio of OPE coeﬃcients
λsss/λφφs leads to a reduction in the size of the islands corresponding to the O(2) and O(3)
vector models. The results are summarized in ﬁgure 2. In studying the O(2) model, we are

1A complementary approach to solving the 3d Ising model with the conformal bootstrap was also

developed in [7, 8].

partially motivated by the present ∼ 8σ discrepancy between measurements of the heat-
capacity critical exponent α in 4He performed aboard the space shuttle STS-52 [16] and
the precise Monte Carlo simulations performed in [17]. While our new O(2) island is not
quite small enough to resolve this issue deﬁnitively, our results have some tension with the
reported 4He measurement and currently favor the Monte Carlo determinations.

This paper is organized as follows.

In section 2 we review the bootstrap equations
relevant for the 3d Ising and O(N ) vector models and explain the scan over relative OPE
coeﬃcients employed in this work. In section 3 we describe our results, and in section 4 we
give a brief discussion. Details of our numerical implementation are given in appendix A.

2 Bootstrap Constraints

2.1 Ising Model

We will be studying the conformal bootstrap constraints for 3d CFTs with either a Z2 or

we consider all 4-point functions containing the leading Z2-odd scalar σ and leading Z2-
even scalar . The resulting system of bootstrap equations for {(cid:104)σσσσ(cid:105),(cid:104)σσ(cid:105),(cid:104)(cid:105)} was
presented in detail in [5]. Here we summarize the results. The crossing symmetry conditions
for these correlators can be expressed as a set of 5 sum rules:

If such a functional can be found, then the assumed values of (∆σ, ∆) are incompatible with
unitarity or reﬂection positivity. In [5, 6] we found that this leads to an isolated allowed
island in operator dimension space compatible with known values in the 3d Ising model,
with a size dependent on the size of the search space for the functional. One can additionally
incorporate the constraint λσσ = λσσ by only requiring positivity for the combination

If instead we assume that σ and  are isolated and that there are no other
contributions at their scaling dimensions, then we can replace (2.3) with the weaker condition

for some unknown angle θ ≡ tan−1(λ/λσσ). By scanning over the possible values of θ
and taking the union of the resulting allowed regions (an idea ﬁrst explored in [19]), we
can eﬀectively allow our functional to depend on this unknown ratio and arrive at a smaller
allowed region, forbidding solutions to crossing of the uninteresting form (2.4).

Similarly, when there is an O(N ) symmetry, we can consider all 4-point functions containing
the leading O(N ) vector φi and leading O(N ) singlet s. The resulting system of bootstrap
equations for {(cid:104)φφφφ(cid:105),(cid:104)φφss(cid:105),(cid:104)ssss(cid:105)} was studied in [9], leading to a set of 7 sum rules of

mensions and OPE coeﬃcient ratio in the 3d Ising model to high precision at Λ = 43,3

Our determination of λ is consistent with the estimate 1.45 ± 0.3 obtained via Monte
Carlo methods in [21].4 An application of λ is in calculating the properties of the 3d Ising
model in the presence of quenched disorder in the interaction strength of neighboring spins
[23].

In ﬁgure 2 we show similar islands for the leading vector and singlet operators in the
O(2) and O(3) models, all computed at Λ = 35. We show the zoom in of these regions as
well as the regions at Λ = 19, 27 in ﬁgures 5 and 6. Once the angle θN has been computed
at Λ = 35, we determine the OPE coeﬃcients (λφφs, λsss) by bounding the magnitude λs at
Λ = 27. The ﬁnal error in the OPE coeﬃcients comes mostly from the angle, which is why
we use a lower value of Λ for the magnitude.

analysis of the experimental 4He data of [16], currently in ∼ 8σ tension. Our result is easily
compatible with [17] while it has started to exclude the lower part of the 3σ allowed region
reported in [16]. Based on a na¨ıve extrapolation to a higher derivative cutoﬀ Λ, it seems
plausible that the bootstrap result will eventually fully exclude the reported result of [16]. If
this occurs, we would attribute the discrepancy to the fact that the ﬁt performed in [16] has
a sizable sensitivity to which subleading contributions to the heat capacity are included,
as can be seen in table II of [16].
It is therefore plausible to us that the experimental
uncertainty in the extraction of the critical exponent α should be larger than the reported
error bars.

4 Conclusions

In this work we imposed the uniqueness of the relevant singlet operator appearing in the
conformal block decomposition of (cid:104)φφφφ(cid:105), (cid:104)φφss(cid:105), and (cid:104)ssss(cid:105) in the Ising and O(N ) models.5
The absence of degeneracies is a natural restriction to impose on the CFT spectrum. It
requires a modiﬁed numerical approach because the standard mixed correlator analysis
used in previous works [5, 6, 9, 12–14] secretly allows for more general solutions of crossing
symmetry that violate this assumption.

We implement this new constraint by scanning over the ratio of OPE coeﬃcients λsss/λφφs.
By forbidding uninteresting solutions of crossing we further restricted the allowed region in
the (∆φ, ∆s) plane. This results in a new precise determination of Ising critical exponents,
almost two orders of magnitude better than the best Monte Carlo estimate [18]. We
also improved on our previous determinations for O(2) and O(3), although Monte Carlo
results for operator dimensions remain more precise in those cases. (The bootstrap allows
much more precise determinations of OPE coeﬃcients.) Nevertheless, for O(2), we saw
indications that the conformal bootstrap disfavors the commonly-quoted value extracted
from experimental 4He data in the analysis of [16].

For the sake of completeness we also report qualitative results of attempts to reduce
the size of the allowed regions by imposing additional assumptions. One natural ingredient
not exploited so far is the constraint that the energy momentum tensor appears with the
same central charge in all correlators. Enforcing this also requires imposing a gap between
∆T = 3 and the dimension of the next spin two operator, ∆T (cid:48) = 3 + δ. The net eﬀect is a
non-negligible shrinking of the size of the O(2) island, but unfortunately it only carves out
the upper right region of the island, leaving the rest essentially untouched. The eﬀect is also
independent of the value of the gap as long as 0.2 ≤ δ ≤ 1. Finally, we found that the lower
left endpoint of the O(2) island is controlled by the gap between ∆s and the dimension of
the next singlet scalar ∆s(cid:48); however only when we assume ∆s(cid:48) > 3.7 do we start changing
the size of the O(2) island. This is not surprising since the expected value from MonteCarlo
is ∆s(cid:48) = 3.785(20) [17].
In order to keep the discussion general we decided not to push

with the obvious dictionary to translate to the Ising model: φ → σ, s → .

further in this direction.

As a byproduct of our analysis, we also obtained precise determinations of the OPE
coeﬃcients (λφφs, λsss). While the latter is here computed for the ﬁrst time, the former was
already estimated for the Ising model in [4], using again a bootstrap approach. There the
value |λφφs| = 1.05183(86) was extracted, which should be compared with the result in (3.4).
The two determinations are fully compatible, despite the methods used to obtain the two
estimates being somewhat diﬀerent, both in the theoretical and numerical approach to the
conformal bootstrap. The present work uses mixed correlators, it translates the crossing
constraints into a semideﬁnite programming problem, and rules out unfeasible points in the
CFT parameter space. The work of [4], instead, used a linear programming algorithm to
solve the crossing equations directly under the assumption that the 3d Ising model is the
3d CFT which locally minimizes the central charge. The agreement of these methods is a
further triumph of the numerical bootstrap.

The new ingredient studied in this work represents a further step in the numerical
development of the conformal bootstrap. It not only further reduces the size of the allowed
parameter space, but it also provides rigorous information on OPE coeﬃcients.
It will
be interesting to investigate the eﬀect of scanning over relative OPE coeﬃcients in other
situations where the bootstrap seems to be successful, both in known theories such as N = 4
supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory [24], the 6d (2,0) SCFTs [25], and the conformal window
of QCD [15], as well as in studies of the mysterious features that have appeared in the 4d
N = 1 [26, 27] and 3d fermion [28] bootstrap that may signal the existence of new islands
in the ocean of CFTs.

A Implementation Details

Using the techniques described in the main text, we can set up a semideﬁnite program to
determine whether a triple (∆σ, ∆, θ) is allowed. (In this discussion, we focus on the Ising
model for simplicity.) Our choices and parameters for solving the semideﬁnite program are
identical to those quoted in [9]. To actually determine (∆σ, ∆, θ) in the Ising model, we

13

must make a 3d exclusion plot at successively larger values of Λ. We proceed as follows:

• We ﬁrst choose a relatively small value Λ = Λ0. (For us, Λ0 = 11.) Since we roughly
know the 2d projection of the 3d Island from previous work [6], we begin by choosing
some points (∆σ, ∆) in the 2d island and performing a 1d scan over θ. If we’re lucky,
this gives at least one point p0 in the 3d island.

• By scanning over a 3d grid near p0, we determine the rough shape SΛ0 of the 3d island.
• The island shrinks in an approximately self-similar way as Λ is increased. Once we
know the shape SΛ0, we ﬁnd an aﬃne transformation TΛ0 : SΛ0 → [−1, 1]3 such that
SΛ=19 becomes approximately spherical, with large volume in [−1, 1]3. TΛ0 gives a
useful set of coordinates for a neighborhood of SΛ0. These coordinates are much
better than (∆σ, ∆, θ), because SΛ0 is extremely elongated and ﬂat in (∆σ, ∆, θ)
space (ﬁgure 3). It is helpful to choose TΛ0 so that the plane ∆− ∆σ = 0 is parallel to
two of the axes in [−1, 1]3. This ensures that a grid-based scan over [−1, 1]3 involves
only a small number of values of ∆ − ∆σ, which means we must compute fewer tables
of conformal blocks. This is the 3d generalization of the trick mentioned in [5].

• Now that we have a better reference frame for SΛ0, our job is easier. We increase
Λ0 → Λ1 and determine a point p1 ∈ SΛ1 using a rough scan. We then determine
the boundary of SΛ1 by performing a binary search in the radial direction away from
p1, in the TΛ0 coordinates. For the angular directions, we choose the vertices and
edge-midpoints of an icosahedron centered at p1, oriented so that ∆ − ∆σ takes as
few values as possible during the search. To get a higher resolution picture of SΛ1, we
can pick a few more points in the interior and perform radial binary searches away
from those points as well. Once we know SΛ1 we choose a new TΛ1 : SΛ1 → [−1, 1]3.
• We now iterate the previous step to increase Λ1 → Λ2 → Λ3 . . . . After a few iterations,
we can predict the point the islands are shrinking towards, removing the need for a
scan at each stage. We take Λ0 = 11, Λ1 = 19, Λ2 = 27, Λ3 = 35, Λ4 = 43.

reducing the number of tables of conformal blocks needed for scans. The images of the 3d
