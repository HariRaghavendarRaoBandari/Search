Blast-wave model description of the HBT radii measured in

pp collisions at the LHC energies∗

Wojciech Florkowski

Institute of Nuclear Physics, 31-342 Krakow, Poland

Blast-wave model is applied to describe the Hanbury-Brown–Twiss
(HBT) radii of pionic systems produced in pp collisions at the LHC en-
ergies.

PACS numbers: 25.75.Gz, 25.75.Ld

Dedicated to Professor Jan Pluta on the occasion of his 70th birthday

1. Introduction

At very high energies, such as those presently available at the LHC, the
ﬁnal state hadron multiplicities in pp collisions become large and hydro-
dynamic description of hadron production in these processes may become
possible in the similar way as in peripheral heavy-ion collisions [1, 2, 3].
Following this expectation, in this conference proceedings I use the hydro-
inspired, blast-wave model to analyse the ALICE data on pion correlation
functions [4]. This work highlights some of the recent results obtained to-
gether with A. Bialas and K. Zalewski [5, 6, 7].

2. Blast-wave model

I use the most common version of the blast-wave model [8, 9, 10, 11].

At freeze-out, pions are created at a ﬁxed proper time τ = τf = √t2 − z2.

Then, the single-particle source function becomes

w(k, x) = k0 cosh ηe−U cosh η+V cos φf (r),

(1)

where k0 = (m2 + k2
⊥)1/2 is the pion energy (with m and k⊥ being the
pion mass and transverse momentum, respectively), while η, φ and r are

the space-time rapidity, azimuthal angle and transverse distance from the
symmetry axis 1. I also use the notation U = βk0 cosh θ and V = βk⊥ sinh θ,
with T = 1/β being the freeze-out temperature. The function θ describes
the Hubble-like transverse ﬂow sinh θ = ωr, with ω being a parameter [12].
The function f (r) deﬁnes the transverse proﬁle/density of the source.
It turns out that the model can describe the HBT radii measured by the
ALICE collaboration if the function f (r) is taken in the form

f (r) ∼ e−(r−R)2/δ2

(2)
corresponding to a ”shell” of the width √2 δ and the radius R [6]. Thus, the
model contains altogether ﬁve free parameters: T, ω, τf , R and δ, which
may depend on the multiplicity of the event. The freeze-out temperature is
set equal to T = 100 MeV and the width of the shell is taken as δ = 0.75 fm.
The measured average transverse momentum, taken from CMS [13], ﬁxes
(for each multiplicity bin) the relation between ωR and the ratio R/δ. In
this way, one is left with the two free parameters: R and τf , which are ﬁtted
with the χ2 method. The model parameters and χ2 values determined for
various multiplicity classes are shown in Table 1. The number of degrees
of freedom is 13, χ2 excludes the ﬁrst bin in k⊥, while χ2
tot includes all the
bins.

3. Correlation functions

The Bose-Einstein correlation function of two identical particles is de-
ﬁned as the ratio of the two-particle distribution and the product of the
one-particle distributions [14]. In our model it is given by the formula [5, 6]

C(p1, p2) = 1 +

˜w(P12; Q) ˜w(P12;−Q)

w(p1)w(p2)

= 1 + | ˜w(P12, Q)|2

Table 2. An example of our results for the multiplicity class 23–28 for the side and
out direction.

Here one uses the deﬁnition

˜w(P12; Q) = Z dx eiQxw(P12; x), w(p) = Z dx w(p; x),

(4)

where P12 = (p1 + p2)/2 and Q = (p1 − p2). For boost-invariant and
cylindrically symmetric systems, the average three-momentum of a pair may
be set along the x axis (the “out” direction). The remaining two orthogonal
directions are denoted as the “long” and “side” directions. The HBT radii
are the logarithmic derivatives of the correlation functions calculated along
these three directions for Q → 0 [14].
An example of our results, obtained for the multiplicity class 23–28
for the “side” and “out” directions, is shown in Table 2. The agreement
between the model results and the data is very good. Interestingly, one can
reproduce the values of the radius Rout that becomes smaller than Rside for
large values of P⊥. This behaviour reminds the HBT puzzle discussed in the
context of heavy-ion collisions [15, 16]. One can check that in our case, the
crucial ingredient of the model, responsible for the correct description of the
ratio Rout/Rout, is the “shell” structure described by the density proﬁle (2).
This ﬁnding is similar to the observation made in [17] where the data [18]
has been analysed.

4. Closing remarks

In this conference contribution I have given further evidence that pi-
ons produced in high-energy pp collisions originate from a thermally equili-
brated, expanding source.

Let me note that various attempts to interpret hadron production within
thermal and statistical models have been the subject of a very successful

collaboration between Krakow theoretical and Warsaw experimental groups,
which was initiated by Professor Jan Pluta at the beginning of 2000s.
Our intense scientiﬁc contacts led to the construction of the Therminator
code [19] and to many papers discussing various aspects of femtoscopy [20],
including the HBT puzzle [15]. During the WPCF 2015 Workshop we have
celebrated Jan’s 70th birthday. I hope Jan will remain in good shape, very
active, and full of inspiring ideas for our community in the following years.
