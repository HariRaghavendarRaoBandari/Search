Abstract

Let P be a set of n points embedded in the plane, and let C be the complete Euclidean graph
whose point set is P. Each edge in C between two points p, q is realized as the line segment [pq],
and is assigned a weight equal to the Euclidean distance |pq|. In this paper, we show how to
construct in O(n lg n) time a plane spanner of C of maximum degree at most 4 and stretch factor
at most 20. This improves a long sequence of results on the construction of plane spanners of C.
Our result matches the smallest known upper bound of 4 by Bonichon et al. on the maximum
degree of plane spanners of C, while signiﬁcantly improving their stretch factor upper bound
from 156.82 to 20. The construction of our spanner is based on Delaunay triangulations deﬁned
with respect to the equilateral-triangle distance, and uses a diﬀerent approach than that used by
Bonichon et al. Our approach leads to a simple and intuitive construction of a well-structured
spanner, and reveals useful structural properties of the Delaunay triangulations deﬁned with
respect to the equilateral-triangle distance. The structure of the constructed spanner implies
that when P is in convex position, the maximum degree of this spanner is at most 3. Combining
the above degree upper bound with the fact that 3 is a lower bound on the maximum degree
of any plane spanner of C when the point-set P is in convex position, the results in this paper
give a tight bound of 3 on the maximum degree of plane spanners of C for point-sets in convex
position.

Introduction

1
Let P be a set of n points embedded in the plane, and let C be the complete Euclidean graph
whose point-set is P. Each edge in C between two points p, q is realized as the line segment
[pq], and is assigned a weight equal to the Euclidean distance |pq|. For any constant ρ ≥ 1, a
subgraph S of C is a ρ-spanner of C if for any two points p, q ∈ P, there is a path between
p and q in S whose weight is at most ρ · |pq|. A subgraph S of C is a spanner of C if there
exists a constant ρ ≥ 1 such that S is a ρ-spanner of C; the minimum such ρ is referred to
as the stretch factor of S. In this paper, we consider the problem of constructing a plane
spanner of C of small degree and small stretch factor. This problem has received considerable
attention, and there is a long list of results on the construction of plane spanners of C that
achieve various trade-oﬀs between the degree and the stretch factor of the spanner.
The problem of constructing a plane spanner of C was considered as early as the 1980’s, if
not earlier. Chew [10] proved that the L1-Delaunay triangulation of P, which is the Delaunay
10-spanner of C. Chew’s
triangulation of P deﬁned with respect to the L1-distance, is a

result was followed by a series of papers showing that other Delaunay triangulations are
plane spanners as well. In 1987, Dobkin et al. [13] showed that the classical L2-Delaunay
√
triangulation of P is a plane spanner of stretch factor at most π(1+
. This bound was
2
subsequently improved by Keil and Gutwin [15] to 4π
3. In the meantime, Chew [11] showed
√
that the T D-Delaunay triangulation deﬁned using a distance function based on an equilateral
triangle — rather than a square (L1-distance) or a circle (L2-distance) — is a 2-spanner.
This result was generalized by Bose et al. [6], who showed that the Delaunay triangulation
deﬁned with respect to any convex distance function (i.e., based on a convex shape) is a
spanner of C. The bound on the stretch factor of the L2-Delaunay triangulation by Keil and
Gutwin stood unchallenged for many years until Xia recently improved the bound to below
2 [20]. Recently as well, Bonichon et al. [3] improved Chew’s original bound on the stretch
2, and showed this bound to be tight.
All the Delaunay triangulations mentioned above can have unbounded degree. In recent
years, bounded degree plane spanners have been used as the building block of wireless
network topologies. Wireless distributed system technologies, such as wireless ad-hoc and
sensor networks, are often modeled as proximity graphs in the Euclidean plane. Spanners
of proximity graphs represent topologies that can be used for eﬃcient communication. For
these applications, in addition to having low stretch factor, spanners are typically required
to be plane and have bounded degree, where both requirements are useful for eﬃcient
routing [8, 19].

The wireless network applications motivated researchers to turn their attention to mini-
mizing the maximum degree of the plane spanner as well as its stretch factor. It can be readily
seen that 3 is a lower bound on the maximum degree of a spanner of C, because a Hamiltonian
path through a set of points arranged in a grid has unbounded stretch factor. Work on
bounded degree but not necessarily plane spanners of C closely followed the above-mentioned
work on plane spanners. In a 1992 breakthrough, Salowe [18] proved the existence of spanners
of maximum degree 4. The question was then resolved by Das and Heﬀernan [12] who showed
that spanners of maximum degree 3 always exist. The focus in this line of research was to
prove the existence of low degree spanners and the techniques developed to do so were not
tuned towards constructing spanners that had both low degree and low stretch factor. For
example, the bound on the stretch factor of the degree 4 spanner in Salowe [18] is greater
than 109, which is far from practical. Furthermore, the bounded-degree spanners shown to
exist are not guaranteed to be plane.

Bose et al. [7] were the ﬁrst to show how to extract a subgraph of the L2-Delaunay
triangulation that is a bounded-degree, plane spanner of C. The maximum degree and stretch
factor they obtained were subsequently improved by Li and Wang [16], by Bose et al. [9],
and by Kanj and Perković [14] (see Table 1). The approach used in all these results was to
extract a bounded degree spanning subgraph of the L2-Delaunay triangulation and the main
goal was to obtain a bounded-degree plane spanner of C with the smallest possible stretch
factor. In a breakthrough result, Bonichon et al. [2] lowered the bound on the maximum
degree of a plane spanner from 14 to 6. Instead of using the L2-Delaunay triangulation
as the starting point of the spanner construction, they used the Delaunay triangulation
based on the equilateral-triangle distance, deﬁned originally by Chew [11], and exploited a
connection between these Delaunay triangulations and 1
2-θ graphs. The plane spanner they
constructed also has a small stretch factor of 6. Independently, Bose et al. [5] were also able
to obtain a plane spanner of maximum degree at most 6, by starting from the L2-Delaunay
triangulation. Recently, Bonichon et al. [4] were able to construct a plane spanner of degree
at most 4 and stretch factor at most 156.82. Their construction is based on the Delaunay

triangulation deﬁned with respect to the L1 norm. Most of the above spanner constructions
can be performed in time O(n lg n), where n is the number of points in P.
In this paper, we present a construction of a plane spanner S of C of degree at most 4 and
stretch factor at most 20. This result matches the smallest known upper bound of 4 on the
maximum degree of the spanner by Bonichon et al. [4], while signiﬁcantly improving their
stretch factor bound from 156.82 to 20. Our construction is also simpler and more intuitive. It
is based on Delaunay triangulations deﬁned with respect to the equilateral-triangle distance,
just like the degree 6 spanner construction used by Bonichon et al. [2], which could be
viewed as the starting point of our construction. To get down to maximum degree 4, our
approach introduces fresh techniques in both the construction and the analysis of the spanner.
Unlike the approach in [2], our approach has a bias towards certain edges of the Delaunay
triangulation; this bias ensures that the constructed spanner is well structured. To make up
for edges not in the spanner, we make use of recursion which, unlike the construction in [4],
may have depth not bounded by a constant. To ensure that the recursion is controlled and
yields short paths, we aggressively add shortcut edges to the spanner to ensure the existence
of paths with speciﬁc monotonicity properties, which we refer to as monotone weak paths.
Finally, in our analysis we use a new type of distance metric and we also take the extra step
of analyzing the stretch factor of our spanner with respect to C directly, rather than with
respect to the underlying Delaunay triangulation.

The structure of the spanner, attained due to biasing certain Delaunay edges, allows us
to prove that if the given point-set is in convex position, then the constructed spanner has
maximum degree at most 3. Therefore, for any point-set in convex position, there exists a
plane spanner of C of maximum degree at most 3. We also show that 3 is a lower bound on
the maximum degree of plane spanners of C for point-sets in convex position. The preceding
implies that 3 is a tight bound on the maximum degree of plane spanners of C for point-sets
in convex position, and this completely and satisfactorily resolves the question about the
maximum degree of plane geometric spanners of C for point-sets in convex position.

Preliminaries

2
Given a set of points P embedded in the Euclidean plane, we consider the complete weighted
graph C(P), or simply C, where each edge between any two points p, q ∈ P is associated
with the line segment [pq], and is assigned a weight equal to the Euclidean distance |pq|.
Given a subgraph G of C, we deﬁne G to be a plane subgraph if the edges of G do not cross

XX:4

Degree Four Plane Spanners: Simpler and Better

each other, i.e., the line segments associated with the edges of G intersect only at their
endpoints. The maximum degree of G is the maximum degree (in G) over all points in P; we
say that a family of graphs has bounded degree if there is an integer constant c ≥ 0 such that
every graph in the family has a maximum degree at most c. If graph G is connected, we
deﬁne the distance between any two points p, q ∈ P, denoted dG(p, q), to be the weight of a
minimum-weight path between p and q in G, where the weight of a path is the sum of the
weights of its edges.

Given a constant ρ ≥ 1, we say that G is a ρ-spanner of C if for any two points p, q ∈ P,
dG(p, q) ≤ ρ · |pq|. We also say that a family of geometric graphs, one for every ﬁnite set P
of points in the plane, is a spanner if there is a constant ρ ≥ 1 such that every graph G(P)
in the family is a ρ-spanner of C(P); we refer to the minimum such constant ρ as the stretch
factor of the family. In this paper, the family we consider consists of the spanners obtained
by applying our algorithm on all ﬁnite point-sets in the plane.

In this paper, we rely on a metric that is diﬀerent from the Euclidean metric. In order to
deﬁne this metric, we ﬁx an equilateral triangle with two of its points lying on the x-axis at
coordinates (0, 0) and (1, 0), and the third point lying below the x-axis; we use the symbol
5 to refer to this equilateral triangle. We deﬁne a triangle to be a 5-homothet if it can be
obtained through a translation of 5 followed by a scaling. We deﬁne the triangular metric,
d5, as follows:
(cid:73) Deﬁnition 1. For any two points p, q ∈ P, we deﬁne d5(p, q) to be the side-length of the
smallest 5-homothet that contains p and q on its boundary; we denote this triangle 5(p, q).

It is easy to verify that d5 is indeed a metric. In particular, for any two points p, q, we
have d5(p, q) = 0 ⇔ p = q, we have symmetry as in d5(p, q) = d5(q, p), and for any third
point r, we have the triangle inequality d5(p, q) ≤ d5(p, r) + d5(r, q). It is also easy to see
that p or q must be a vertex of the triangle 5(p, q) and that |pq| ≤ d5(p, q).
Using the triangular metric d5, we deﬁne a subgraph D of C as follows. For every point
w ∈ P, we partition the space around w into six equiangular cones whose common apex
is w, three above and three below the horizontal line passing through w, as illustrated in
Figure 1-(a). We denote the middle cone above the horizontal line and the two outer cones
below the horizontal line as the positive cones of w, and the remaining three cones as the
negative cones of w. Each point w chooses an edge in each of its three positive cones by
selecting the point v 6= w in the cone such that d5(w, v) is minimum. Assuming that P
is in general position1, for any two distinct points v, v0 in a positive cone of w, we obtain
d5(w, v) 6= d5(w, v0). Let D be the graph whose vertex-set is P and whose edge-set is the
set of edges selected as described.
2-θ graph of P is the
graph whose point-set is P, and whose edges are obtained as follows: at each point w, and
for each of the three positive cones of apex w, select the edge wv in the cone where v is the
point whose projection distance to the angular bisector of the cone is minimum. Bonichon
2-θ graph of P is the same as the TD-Delaunay triangulation of
et al. [1] showed that the 1
P [11] deﬁned based on the empty triangle property: there is an edge between two point
v, w ∈ P if there exists a homothet of 5 containing v and w on its boundary whose interior

We make the following observation regarding the graph D. The 1

1 P is in general position if no pair of points v, w ∈ P lie on a line parallel to any of the boundary lines
deﬁning the six cones. We note that it is always possible to rotate the equilateral triangle that deﬁnes
the metric d5 to ensure that the ﬁnite set P is in general position and so the results in this paper hold
for all sets of points and not just for points in general position.

is empty of points of P. It is easy to see that the 1
deﬁned above, and hence with the TD-Delaunay triangulation2.

2-θ graph of P coincides with the graph D
For convenience, we label the positive cones at each point of P, in clockwise order and
starting with the positive cone above the horizontal line, red, green, and blue; we also label the
negative cones, in clockwise order and starting with the negative cone below the horizontal
line, red, green, and blue. We assign an orientation and a color to the edges of D by orienting
each edge outwards from the point w that selects it and by coloring it red, blue, or green
depending on whether the edge lies in the positive red, blue, or green cone of point w, as
illustrated in Figure 1-(a). We emphasize that the edge orientations are only used for the
purpose of constructing the spanner and proving its desired properties; the ﬁnal spanner in
our construction is an undirected graph obtained by removing edge orientations. In fact, we
will abuse terminology and, throughout the paper, use the term path to refer to weak paths
in D; we will always use the term directed path when edge orientations are relevant.
We observe that for any point w ∈ P there is at most one edge outgoing from w in a
positive cone of w, but there can be an unbounded number of edges incoming to w in a
negative cone of w, and that in such cases all these edges have the same color as the cone
itself (e.g., see Figure 1-(b)). We follow the same approach as Bonichon et al. [2], and identify
in each negative cone of point w an edge that plays a key role in the spanner construction:
(cid:73) Deﬁnition 2. For any point w ∈ P, and for each negative cone of w that contains at least
one edge incoming to w, let (directed) edge (v, w) ∈ D be the edge in the cone such that
d5(v, w) is minimum. We deﬁne (v, w) to be the anchor of w in the cone.
We say that anchors incident to the same point w are adjacent if their cones are adjacent.
Note that for any two adjacent anchors incident to w, one of the two adjacent anchors must
lie in a positive cone of w and must be an anchor of a point other than w.
Consider a negative cone of a point w ∈ P containing at least one incoming edge to w in
D. Let (v1, w), . . . , (vk, w) ∈ D, where k ≥ 1, be all the incoming edges to w that lie in the
cone, listed in counterclockwise order, as illustrated in Figure 1-(b), and let (vj, w), for some
j such that 1 ≤ j ≤ k, be the anchor of w in the cone. We call (v1, w), . . . , (vk, w) the fan
of the anchor (vj, w). We identify (vj, w) as the anchor of each edge in the fan. Note that
every edge in D has an anchor which could be itself. We call the ﬁrst edge (v1, w) and the
last edge (vk, w) of the fan the boundary edges of the anchor (vj, w). Note that either one
(possibly both) of the boundary edges of an anchor could be the anchor itself. If k ≥ 2, since
D is a triangulation, it follows that (vi, vi+1, w) is a triangle in D, for i = 1, . . . , k − 1. Hence,
v1, . . . , vk is a (weak) path in D between the endpoints v1 and vk. We call this path the
canonical path of w in the designated cone; we also call each edge on this path a canonical
edge of w. Finally, we refer to the (weak) subpath vr, . . . , vs of the canonical path v1, . . . , vk
of w as the canonical path between vr and vs of w. The two sides of an edge are the two
half-planes deﬁned by the line obtained by extending the edge. We say that a canonical edge
e is canonical on a side of e if e is a canonical edge of a point that lies on that side of e.
Note that a canonical edge can be canonical on both sides.
We state the following easy to verify facts without proof:

(cid:73) Lemma 3. Let (s, t) be a canonical edge of a point w, and let (s0, t) be the anchor of (s, t).
a. The edges (s, w) and (t, w) are in D.

2 A TD-Delaunay triangulation of P is not necessarily a triangulation of P as deﬁned traditionally (a tri-
angulation of the convex hull of the set of points). Just as Chew [11] did, we abuse the term triangulation
because TD-Delaunay triangulations are closely related to classical L2-Delaunay triangulations.

b. The edge (s, w) cannot be a canonical edge on the side containing t.
c. The edge (t, w) is not an anchor.
d. The edge (s, t) is a boundary edge of its anchor (s0, t).

3 Monotone (weak) paths
We deﬁne next a type of path in D that generalizes canonical paths and that will be a key
tool in our construction. We give two equivalent deﬁnitions of such a path; proving the
equivalence between these two deﬁnitions is easy.
(cid:73) Deﬁnition 4. Let v be a point lying in the positive cone of u whose color is c. A (weak)
path in D between u and v is monotone if the path is bi-colored, with c being one of the
colors, and the path satisﬁes the two equivalent properties:

After reversing the direction of all edges not colored c, the path is directed from u to v.
No two consecutive edges of the path lie in neighboring cones of the shared endpoint.
The key property of a monotone path between u and v is that its length can be bounded
by twice the side-length of 5(u, v), i.e., by 2d5(u, v). This follows from a stronger insight

P is a monotone path between u and v with edges colored green or red. The projection onto zu
(resp. zy) of (u, p2), (p1, p2), and (p1, v) do not overlap and are contained within [zu] (resp. [zv]).

which we develop next. To facilitate our discussion, we label the vertices of a 5-homothet
green, blue, and red, in clockwise order starting from the upper left vertex. Let v be a point
lying in a positive cone of u of color c1. With u being the vertex of 5(u, v) of color c1, let
the remaining two vertices of 5(u, v) be y and z, and let c2 be the color of y and c3 be the
color of z.
(cid:73) Deﬁnition 5. We deﬁne (refer to Figure 2 where c1 = green, c2 = red, and c3 = blue):
1. δc25(u, v) = δc25(v, u) = |yv|.
2. δc35(u, v) = δc35(v, u) = |zv|.
3. δmin5 (u, v) = δmin5 (v, u) = min{δc25(u, v), δc35(u, v)}.

Let P be a monotone path in D between u and v, and let the edges of P be colored c1
or c2. We deﬁne, using the lines zv and zu as axes of a coordinate system of the Euclidean
plane, the projection onto zv and zu (see Figure 2-(b)). In the following lemma, we use this
projection to map the edges of P to upper bound the length of P:
(cid:73) Lemma 6. Let v be a point lying in the positive cone of u of color c1. For any monotone
path P between u and v whose edges are colored c1 or c2 (refer to Figure 2 where c1 = green,
c2 = red, and c3 = blue):
a. The projections of all edges of P onto zu (resp., zv) do not overlap and are contained

within the segment [zu] (resp., [zv]); see Figures 2-(b) and 2-(c).

(p, q) has length d5(p, q) ≥ |pq|.

b. If (p, q) is an edge of P colored c1 (resp., c2) then the projection onto zu (resp., zv) of
c. The sum of the lengths of the edges of P colored c1 is at most d5(u, v) = |zu|.
d. The sum of the lengths of the edges of P colored c2 is at most δc35(u, v) = |zv|.
e. The length of P is at most 2d5(u, v).

Proof. For part (a), we consider the coordinates of the points of P in the coordinate system
of the Euclidean plane deﬁned by using the lines zv and zu as axes. When visiting the points
of P in the order in which they appear on P, the coordinates of the points along the zu
(resp., zv) axis form a monotonic sequence (decreasing or increasing) between the coordinates
of u and z (resp. z and v), and part (a) follows. Since zu is parallel to an edge of 5(p, q),
and hence the projection of (p, q) onto zu has length d5(p, q), part (b) follows. Parts (c) and
(cid:74)
(d) follow from parts (a) and (b), and part (e) follows from parts (c) and (d).

The following lemma, illustrated in Figure 3-(a), is an insight implicit in Lemma 2 of [2]

that is implied by Lemma 6.
(cid:73) Lemma 7. For any two edges (v, w) and (u, w) that lie in the same fan:
a. The canonical path P between v and u is monotone.
b. The sum of the lengths of all monochromatic edges on P is at most d5(v, u).
c. The length of the canonical path P between v to u is at most 2d5(v, u).
Proof. For part (a), we assume, without loss of generality, that w lies in the red positive
cones of v and of u. We then observe that for every point p on P, (p, w) is an edge in D.
Therefore, every edge of P must lie in the blue or green positive cones of its tail, and thus
path P is bi-colored. Furthermore, since D is planar, at every intermediate point p of P, the
two edges of P incident to p must lie in non-adjacent cones. The canonical path P between
(cid:74)
v and u is thus monotone. Hence, parts (b) and (c) follow by Lemma 6.

The Spanner

4
In this section, we describe the construction of a plane spanner of C of maximum degree at
most 4 and stretch factor at most 20. In our construction, we will bias blue – positive and
negative – cones and edges. This bias results in a spanner satisfying structural properties
that allow us to prove the desired upper bounds on the spanner degree and stretch factor.
This bias also ensures that the spanner has maximum degree at most 3 when the point-set
P is in convex position. We ﬁnd it convenient to refer to the four non-blue cones, as well
as all the red and green edges, as white, as illustrated in Figure 3-(b), and introduce some
terminologies.

If e is a canonical edge of a point w that lies in a white (resp., blue) cone of w, we say
that e is a canonical edge in a white (resp., blue) cone. We note that a canonical edge could
be in a white cone of one point and in a blue cone of another. Given a white anchor (v, w),
the ray starting from w extending (v, w) partitions the (white) negative cone of w containing
v into two sides: we refer to the side of the cone that is adjacent to a blue cone as the blue
side, and we refer to the other side that is adjacent to a white cone as the white side. We
say that an edge (u, w) in the fan of (v, w) is on the white side (resp. blue side) if it is on the
white side (resp. blue side) of (v, w).
The following describes the construction of the spanner S of C. The construction is based
on the underlying triangulation D of C. We start by constructing a degree-4 anchor subgraph
A of S that includes all blue anchors. We then ﬁnalize S by adding some white canonical
edges and shortcuts to ensure the reconstructibility of all canonical paths.

Constructing the anchor subgraph A of S:

Figure 4 (a) In step 3, white canonical edges of w in the negative blue cone of w are added to S
if not in A already; in step 4, any pair of canonical edges of w added in step 3 that are incoming
at the same point are replaced by a shortcut between the outgoing endpoints ((p6, p5) and (p4, p5)
replaced by shortcut (p6, p4) and (p3,2 ) and (p1, p2) replaced by shortcut (p3, p1).) (b) Shortcut
edges (p3, p0) and (p7, p4) are added to S in step 6; edges (p7, p6) and (p3, p2) are not in S unless
they are anchors in A.

5. We add to S every white canonical edge that is on the white side of its (white) anchor,

but only if its anchor is not in A.

6. For every white anchor (v, w) and its boundary edge (u, w) 6= (v, w) on the white side,
let P be the canonical path (u = p0, p1, . . . , pk = v). We apply the following procedure
at a current point pi starting with i = 0 and stopping when i = k:

a. If the canonical edge (pi+1, pi) is white, we skip this edge and set i to i + 1;
b. Otherwise, (pi, pi+1) must be blue. Let j > i be the largest index of a point on P such
that the line segment [pipj] does not intersect the canonical path from pi to pj (except
at pi and pj). We add the shortcut (pj, pi) to S and color it white; we remove the
(white) canonical edge (pj, pj−1) from S if (pj, pj−1) ∈ S \ A; and we set i to j.

In the following section we prove that this algorithm yields a plane spanner of maximum
degree at most 4 and stretch factor at most 20. We provide here a high-level overview of our
arguments.

To show planarity, we note that the underlying graph D is planar and that the only
edges of S not in D are the shortcut edges added in steps 4 and 6.b. We will prove in
Lemmas 10 and 11 that each such edge does not intersect any other edge of S. For the
degree upper bound, we note that the ﬁrst two steps of the algorithm yield the subgraph A
of maximum degree at most 4. In the remaining steps, we carefully add additional edges,
whether canonical edges or shortcuts of canonical paths. To prove the degree bound, we
develop a charging argument that assigns each edge of S to a cone at each endpoint and
show, in Lemma 13, that no more than 4 cones are charged at every point.

Note that step 1 adds all blue anchors to S. For white anchors, we cannot include all of
them in S because of the degree bound. However, by considering anchors in an increasing
order of their length in step 2, we can ensure that a white anchor is not added to S only if
an adjacent shorter white anchor was added to S. This ordering is crucial because it allows
us to use short anchors in S to reconstruct longer anchors not in S.

In steps 3 and 4, we add to S all (white) canonical edges in blue cones, except for some
consecutive pairs of canonical edges that are replaced with shortcut edges. Therefore, steps
1 through 4 of the algorithm ensure that every canonical path in a blue cone has been

XX:10 Degree Four Plane Spanners: Simpler and Better

reconstructed. In particular, since all blue anchors are in S, every blue boundary edge, and
therefore every blue canonical edge, has been reconstructed.

Consider now a canonical path P in a white negative cone of w, and the two subpaths
Pw and Pb of P on the white side and the blue side of this cone, respectively. In step 6, we
take shortcuts to obtain, together with step 5, a white monotone path to ensure that there
is a short path reconstructing Pw. As for Pb, we argued above that the blue edges of Pb
are reconstructible. As for the white edges of Pb, we note that they are on the white side
of their anchors, and hence, the argument used to reconstruct Pw above applies to them as
well. The above, once again with step 5, ensures the reconstructibility of Pb, and hence of P.

Properties of the Spanner

In this section, we prove the three properties of the spanner obtained using our algorithm:
planarity, the maximum degree upper bound of 4, and the stretch factor bound of 20. We
start with the following justiﬁcation for coloring shortcut edges added in step 6 white:
(cid:73) Lemma 8. For every shortcut edge (pj, pi) added to S in step 6, pj and v = pk both lie in
the same negative white cone of pi, and they both lie in the same negative white cone of pj−1.
Proof. Because d5(w, pk) < d5(w, pi) and (pi, w) ∈ D, pk must lie in a negative white cone
of pi. The lemma thus holds if j = k. Otherwise, by the choice of pj, pj must lie on the same
side of line pipk as point w; again, because (pi, w) ∈ D, pj must lie in a (negative) white
(cid:74)
cone of pi that also contains pk. Similar arguments apply to pj−1.

Next, we show that S is plane. We ﬁrst need the following deﬁnition and lemma.
(cid:73) Deﬁnition 9. An edge (u, w) ∈ D is uncrossed if no shortcut in S crosses (u, w).
(cid:73) Lemma 10. All anchors, all canonical edges, and all boundary edges are uncrossed.
Proof. Let (p, r) be a shortcut that was added in step 4 of the spanner construction, let (p, q)
and (r, q) be the pair of canonical edges in the blue cone as described in step 4, and let w be
the apex of this blue cone. It is easy to verify that (q, w) ∈ D is the only edge in D that (p, r)
crosses, and that (q, w) is not a boundary edge, a canonical edge, or an anchor. Next, consider
a shortcut (pj, pi) that was added in step 6 of the spanner construction, and let (v, w) be the
white anchor and pi+1, pi+2, . . . , pj−1 be the points on the canonical path between pi and pj
as described in step 6. Again, it is easy to verify that (pi+1, w), (pi+2, w), . . . , (pj−1, w) are
the only edges in D that the shortcut (pj, pi) crosses, and that none of them is a boundary
(cid:74)
edge, a canonical edge, or an anchor.
(cid:73) Lemma 11. The subgraph S is a plane subgraph of C.
Proof. Let S1 = D ∩ S and S2 = S \ S1. Note that S1 consists of A plus the canonical edges
added in steps (3) or (5) that are kept after steps (4) and (6), and that S2 consists only
of the shortcuts added in steps (4) and (6). Since S1 is a subgraph of D, S1 is plane. By
Lemma 10, all the edges in S1 are uncrossed, i.e., no shortcut (edge in S2) crosses an edge in
S1. To conclude the proof, we show that no two edges in S2 cross either. Observe that any
two shortcuts connect pairs of endpoints of canonical paths that either belong to diﬀerent
fans, and in which case they cannot cross, or belong to the same fan. In the latter case, the
shortcuts do not cross because shortcuts always connect the endpoints of non-overlapping
(cid:74)
canonical paths.

To facilitate the discussion in the proof of the degree upper bound, we refer to the two
adjacent white cones above (resp., below) the horizontal line through a point p ∈ P as the
upper (resp., lower) white sector of p; we also refer to the two blue cones at p as the left
and right blue sectors of p. We develop next a charging scheme and use it to show that, for
each point p, each edge incident to p in S can be mapped in a one-to-one fashion to one of
the four sectors at p. To describe the charging scheme for every edge e ∈ S and for every
endpoint p of e, we deﬁne σ(e, p) to be the sector of p that contains e. Also for a point p, we
denote by LBp, RBp, U Wp, and LWp, the left blue, the right blue, the upper white, and the
lower white sectors of p respectively. We describe in the table below the charging scheme for
every edge e = (x, y) ∈ S based on which step of the construction e is added to S.

(cid:73) Lemma 12. Let p ∈ P. The charging scheme above charges each edge incident to p in S
to one of the sectors at p such that each sector is charged with at most one edge.
Proof. Let p ∈ P. We will show that the charging scheme above charges every edge incident
to p in S to one of the four sectors at p in a one-to-one fashion.

First, consider the left blue sector of p. Observe that LBp could potentially be charged

in each of the following two situations:
i. In step (1) by a blue anchor (x = p, y) ∈ A; and
ii.

in step (3) by a white canonical edge (x, y = p) in a blue cone.
First, observe that (i) and (ii) cannot apply simultaneously by part (c) of Lemma 3.
Second, observe that LBp cannot be charged twice according to situation (ii) because this
means that there are two white canonical edges incoming to p in a blue cone, which would
imply that step (4) of the spanner construction applies, and both incoming edges to p would
be removed from S. It follows that LBp is charged at most once.

Next, we consider the right blue sector of p. Observe that RBp could potentially be

charged in each of the following three situations:
i. In step (1) by a blue anchor (x, y = p) ∈ A;
ii.
iii.

in step (5) by a white canonical edge (x = p, y) in a white cone; and
in step (6) by a shortcut (x = p, y) in a white cone.
First, observe that in both situations (ii) and (iii), we know that there is a white canonical
edge (p, q) in a white cone with apex w, that is (p, w) and (q, w) are white edges in D; in (ii)
(p, q) is (x, y); and in (iii) (p, q) is the (last) edge of the canonical path between x = p and y,
in step (6) of the spanner construction, by the choice of point x in this step.

The existence of this white canonical edge implies that RBp must be empty of edges of

D, that (i) cannot apply when either (ii) or (iii) applies.

Second, by part (b) of Lemma 3, (p, w) is not a canonical edge on the side that contains

q, i.e., (p, w) cannot be a canonical edge in a white cone.

XX:12 Degree Four Plane Spanners: Simpler and Better

Therefore, (p, q) is the only white canonical edge in a white cone that is outgoing from p,

and hence, RBp cannot be charged twice according to (ii), or twice according to (iii).

Finally, (ii) and (iii) cannot apply simultaneously because step (6) of the construction

removes this white canonical edge (p, q) when it adds the shortcut (x, y).

It follows that RBp is charged at most once.
Finally, we consider the upper sector of p, and note that the arguments for the lower
sector of p follow similarly. Observe that U Wp could potentially be charged in each of the
following ﬁve situations:
i. In step (2) by a white anchor (x, y) ∈ A, x = p or y = p;
ii.
iii.
iv.
v.

in step (3) by a white canonical edge (x = p, y) in a blue cone;
in step (4) by a shortcut (x, y) in a blue cone, x = p or y = p;
in step (5) by a white canonical edge (x, y = p) in a white cone; and
in step (6) by a shortcut (x, y = p) in a white cone.
First, since step (2) of the construction disallows adjacent anchors to be in A, U Wp

cannot be charged twice according to (i).

Second, we show that in both situations (ii) and (iii), none of the other situations (i), (iv),
or (v) apply. To show this, we observe that there exists a white canonical edge (p, q) /∈ A in
a blue cone with apex w, that is (p, w) and (q, w) are blue edges in D; in (ii) (p, q) is (x, y)
and in (iii) (p, q) is the canonical edge incident to p that step (4) of the construction removes
after adding the shortcut (x, y).
U Wp must be empty of edges of D, hence, (iv) cannot apply.

The existence of this white canonical edge (p, q) implies that the negative white cone of

(v) cannot apply.

By part (b) of Lemma 3, since (p, w) is not a canonical edge on the side that contains q,
Also, since (p, q) /∈ A is the only outgoing edge in U Wp, (i) cannot apply either.
Next, observe that U Wp cannot be charged twice according to (ii) or according to (iii)

simply because (p, q) is the only canonical edge in a blue cone that lies in U Wp.

Finally, observe that (ii) and (iii) cannot apply simultaneously because as described above

step (4) of the construction removes this canonical edge (p, q).

Assuming that (ii) and (iii) do not apply, we analyze situation (iv). In this case, we know
that the white canonical edge (x, p) is in a white cone with apex w, that is (x, w) and (p, w)
are white edges in D.

Since step (5) of the construction ensures that the anchor of the canonical edge (x, p) is
not in A, and also since by part (c) of Lemma 3, (p, w) is not anchor, thus not in A, we
conclude that (i) does not apply.

Next, since (x, p) is a white and not a blue canonical edge for the fan that contains (x, w)

and (p, w), step (6) of the construction ensures that (v) does not apply.

Finally, observe that U Wp cannot be charged twice according to (iv) simply because (x, p)

is the only canonical edge in a white cone that lies in U Wp.
For the remaining cases, we analyze situation (v). In this case, there is a blue canonical
edge (p, q) in a white cone with apex w, that is (p, w) and (q, w) are white edges in D. The
existence of this blue canonical edge implies that the white cone contained in U Wp is empty
of edges of D, and because step (6) adds a shortcut incoming at p, we know that the only
outgoing white edge (p, w) ∈ U Wp is not an anchor, thus (i) cannot apply. Finally, we cover
all the cases by observing that U Wp cannot be charged twice according to (v) simply because
step (6) of the construction adds at most one shortcut for any blue canonical edge, and
because (p, q) is the only blue (canonical) edge outgoing from p.

Therefore, each of of U Wp and LWp is charged at most once.
It follows from the above that each of the four sectors at p is charged with at most one
(cid:74)

edge incident to p in S. This completes the proof.
(cid:73) Lemma 13. The maximum degree of S is at most 4.
Proof. The statement of the lemma directly follows from Lemma 12 because there are four
sectors at each point p ∈ P.
(cid:74)
The remainder of this section is devoted to showing that the stretch factor of S is at most
20. We do so by ﬁrst proving a sequence of lemmas that derive upper bounds on the distance
in S between the endpoints of diﬀerent types of edges in D; we then use these lemmas to
derive a bound on the stretch factor of S.
(cid:73) Lemma 14. For any uncrossed blue edge (u, w) ∈ D, dS(u, w) ≤ 3d5(u, w).
Proof. Let (v, w) be the blue anchor of the blue edge (u, w). In step (1) of the algorithm,
we add all the blue anchors in S, and thus (v, w) ∈ S. Also, in step (3) of the construction,
we add in S all the canonical edges in blue cones except that, in step (4), we substitute some
pairs of these canonical edges with shortcuts. Since (u, w) is uncrossed, these canonical edges
and shortcuts provide a path for connecting v and u. Using the triangle inequality, this path
that includes the shortcuts is not longer than the canonical path between v and u. Hence,
in the worst case, we may assume, without loss of generality, that the path connecting v
and u consists only of canonical edges on the canonical path. This canonical path plus the
anchor constitutes a path between u and w. By Lemma 7, the length of this canonical path
is bounded by 2d5(v, u) ≤ 2d5(u, w). We also have that |vw| ≤ d5(u, w). Consequently,
the length of this path is bounded by d5(u, w) (anchor) plus 2d5(u, w) (canonical path). It
follows that dS(u, w) ≤ 3d5(u, w).
(cid:74)
(cid:73) Lemma 15. For any white anchor (v, w) and any uncrossed white edge (u, w) ∈ D that
lies on the white side of (v, w), dS(v, u) ≤ d5(v, u) + δblue5 (v, u) ≤ 2d5(v, u). Furthermore,
if (v, w) ∈ S, then dS(u, w) ≤ d5(u, w) + δblue5 (u, w) ≤ 2d5(u, w).
Proof. We describe below how to construct a white monotone path in S between u and v.
If (v, w) ∈ S, we extend this path to a white monotone path between u and w. Then, we
obtain the desired bounds using Lemma 6.

To describe the white monotone path between u and v, we consider the uncrossed edges
of D on the fan of (v, w) whose endpoints lie on the canonical path between v and u. We
observe that shortcuts and white canonical edges connect the (distinct) endpoints of those
uncrossed edges, and that they form a white monotone path between u and v because at each
point the white edges of the path incident to the point lie on opposite sides of the horizontal
line through the point. We call this white monotone path the white monotone connection
between v and u. We know that all of the shortcuts on this white monotone connection are
in S and even though some of the white canonical edges may not be in S, we know, for all
such white canonical edges, that we have their anchors in S. For each such white canonical
edge (s, t), we recursively expand the current white monotone path by including the anchor
(r, t) of (s, t) and by including the white monotone connection between r and s. We observe
that the path obtained after the expansion of (s, t) continues to be a white monotone path.
Therefore, by recursively expanding this path for white canonical edges that are not in S, we
obtain a white monotone path between v and u. Furthermore, if (v, w) ∈ S, we expand this
(cid:74)
path to include the white anchor (v, w) while preserving its monotonicity.

XX:14 Degree Four Plane Spanners: Simpler and Better

(cid:73) Lemma 16. For any white anchor (v, w) and any white edge (u, w) ∈ D that lies on the blue
side of (v, w), dS(v, u) ≤ 5d5(v, u). Furthermore, if (v, w) ∈ S, then dS(u, w) ≤ 6d5(u, w).
Proof. The canonical path from v to u consists of blue and white canonical edges. The
total length of the blue canonical edges does not exceed d5(v, u), and the total length of
the white canonical edges does not exceed d5(v, u) by Lemma 7. By Lemma 10, we know
that all of these canonical edges are uncrossed. By Lemma 14, the total length of the paths
needed to reconstruct these blue canonical edges can be bounded by 3d5(v, u). Also, since
either the white canonical edges themselves or their anchors are in S, the total length of the
white canonical edges can be bounded by 2d5(v, u) by Lemma 15. Therefore, dS(v, u) can
be bounded by 5d5(v, u) for the edge (v, u) as stated. Furthermore, if (v, w) ∈ S, dS(u, w)
(cid:74)
can be bounded by 5d5(v, u) + d5(v, w), which in turn is bounded by 6d5(u, w).
(cid:73) Deﬁnition 17. For any two points p, q ∈ P such that p lies in a white cone of q, we deﬁne
δwhite5 (p, q) = δwhite5 (q, p) = d5(p, q) − δblue5 (p, q).
(cid:73) Lemma 18. For any two white edges (v, w), (u, w) ∈ D that both lie in the same negative
cone of w, if u lies in a positive white cone of v, then δblue5 (u, w) = δblue5 (v, w) + d5(v, u)
and d5(u, w) = d5(v, w) + δblue5 (v, u).
Proof. Since (v, w) ∈ D, we observe that u must lie in the positive white cone of v that does
(cid:74)
not contain w. The rest follows directly from the deﬁnition of δblue5 .
(cid:73) Lemma 19. For any white anchor (v, w), dS(v, w) ≤ 9d5(v, w). Furthermore, for any
uncrossed white edge (u, w) in the fan of (v, w), we have dS(u, w) ≤ 9d5(u, w) + δblue5 (u, w)
if (u, w) lies on the white side of (v, w), and dS(u, w) ≤ 9d5(u, w) otherwise.
Proof. If (v, w) ∈ S, then clearly dS(v, w) ≤ d5(v, w). As for any uncrossed edge (u, w) in
the fan, by Lemma 15, we get a bound of 2d5(u, w) on dS(u, w) if (u, w) lies on the white
side of (v, w), and by Lemma 16, we get a bound of 6d5(u, w) on dS(u, w) if (u, w) lies on
the blue side of (v, w). Then, we consider (v, w) /∈ S and analyze two cases: (v, w) was not
added in A because of an adjacent anchor at w, or because of an adjacent anchor at v.

If (v, w) was not added in A because of an adjacent (white) anchor at w, let (w, w0) be that
anchor (see Figure 5-(a)). By our construction of A, we know that (w, w0) must be shorter
than (v, w), i.e., d5(w, w0) < d5(v, w). Therefore, v lies in the positive blue cone of w0, and
hence, there must be an outgoing blue edge at w0. Let (w0, u0) be that blue edge; then, (u0, w)
must be a white boundary edge of (v, w), and possibly u0 = v. Using the fact that u0 lies
in the positive blue cone of w0, it is easy to verify that d5(v, u0) ≤ δwhite5 (v, w) ≤ d5(v, w).
Similarly, using the fact that u0 lies in a positive white cone of v, it is easy to verify that
d5(w0, u0) ≤ d5(v, w) + δwhite5 (v, w) ≤ 2d5(v, w). Following the path from w to w0 to u0
to v, we bound dS(v, w) by d5(w, w0) for the edge (w, w0), by 3d5(w0, u0) for the edge
(w0, u0) using Lemmas 10 and 14, and by 2d5(v, u0) for the edge (v, u0) using Lemmas 10
and 15. Also, using the above inequalities d5(w, w0) < d5(v, w), d5(v, u0) ≤ d5(v, w), and
d5(w0, u0) ≤ 2d5(v, w), we get the desired upper bound dS(v, w) ≤ 9d5(v, w).

Next, we consider the uncrossed white edges. For any uncrossed edge (u, w) on the white
side of the anchor, the bound on dS(v, w) applies directly to dS(u, w) because the path
between v and w already connects u and w. Also, since d5(v, w) ≤ d5(u, w), we immediately
get dS(u, w) ≤ 9d5(u, w). As for any white edge (u, w) on the blue side of the anchor, we
start by observing that δwhite5 (v, w) ≤ d5(u, w) − d5(v, u), and that d5(v, w) ≤ d5(u, w).
Also, using the above inequalities d5(w, w0) < d5(v, w), and d5(v, u0) ≤ δwhite5 (v, w), and
d5(w0, u0) ≤ d5(v, w) + δwhite5 (v, w), we obtain the inequalities d5(w, w0) ≤ d5(u, w), and

Figure 5 Illustrations of the proof of Lemma 19. (a) The case when (v, w) /∈ A because a shorter
adjacent anchor (w, w0) was added ﬁrst. Edge (w0, u0) is a blue boundary edge and there is a white
monotone path from u0 to v in S. (b) The case when (v, w) /∈ A because a shorter adjacent anchor
(v0, v) was added ﬁrst. Edge (w, u0) is a blue boundary edge and (u0, v) is a white boundary edge on
the white side of its cone and there is a white monotone path between u0 and v0 in S.

d5(v, u0) ≤ d5(u, w) − d5(v, u), and d5(w0, u0) ≤ 2d5(u, w) − d5(v, u). Then, following
the above path from w to v and extending it to u using the canonical edges, we get
dS(u, w) ≤ d5(w, w0) + 3(d5(w0, u0) + d5(v, u)) + 2(d5(v, u0) + d5(v, u)), which is then
bounded by dS(u, w) ≤ d5(u, w) + 6d5(u, w) + 2d5(u, w) = 9d5(u, w).
In the case when (v, w) was not added in A because of an adjacent (white) anchor at v,
(see Figure 5-(b)) let (v0, v) be that anchor. Similarly, we know that (v0, v) must be shorter
than (v, w), i.e., d5(v0, v) < d5(v, w). Therefore, we know that there must be an outgoing
blue edge at w. Let (w, u0) be that blue edge; then, (u0, v) must be a white boundary edge
of (v0, v), possibly u0 = v0. Once again, it is easy to see that the length of the edge (v0, u0)
cannot exceed the length on the white anchor (v, w) and that the length of the blue edge
(w, u0) cannot exceed twice the length of the white anchor (v, w), i.e., d5(v0, u0) ≤ d5(v, w)
and d5(w, u0) ≤ 2d5(v, w). Following the path from w to u0 to v0 to v, we bound dS(v, w) by
3d5(w, u0)+2d5(v0, u0)+d5(v0, v) using Lemmas 10, 14 and 15. Using the above inequalities,
we get the desired upper bound dS(v, w) ≤ 9d5(v, w). As for the uncrossed white edges in
this case, we ﬁrst note that the anchor (v, w) itself is the boundary edge on the blue side and
that there are no white edges on the blue side, thus nothing to prove on the blue side. As for
any uncrossed white edge (u, w) on the white side of (v, w), we follow the path from w to v
as above and to u using the path described in Lemma 15, which also bounds the last step by
d5(v, u) + δblue5 (v, u). We get an upper bound dS(u, w) ≤ 9d5(v, w) + d5(v, u) + δblue5 (v, u).
Since u lies in the white positive cone of v that does not contain w, by Lemma 18, we know
that d5(u, w) = d5(v, w) + δblue5 (v, u), and that d5(v, u) ≤ δblue5 (u, w). Therefore, we get
dS(u, w) ≤ 9d5(u, w) + δblue5 (u, w) as desired.
(cid:74)
(cid:73) Lemma 20. For any crossed blue edge (u, w) ∈ D, dS(u, w) ≤ 3d5(u, w) + 9δmin5 (u, w).
Proof. Let (p, q) be a shortcut (p, q) crosses (u, w). Since this shortcut is in the blue cone,
it must have been added in S replacing two white canonical edges incoming at u, namely
(p, u) and (q, u). As p and q are endpoints of the shortcut (p, q), both blue edges (p, w) and
(q, w) are uncrossed. Consequently, we have dS(p, w) ≤ 3d5(p, w) and dS(q, w) ≤ 3d5(q, w)
by Lemma 14. Furthermore, by Lemmas 10 and 19 we know that both of the canonical edges
(p, u) and (q, u) satisfy the inequalities dS(p, u) ≤ 9d5(p, u) and dS(q, u) ≤ 9d5(q, u). Since
both of these canonical edges are incoming at u, we also know that one of them, say (p, u),
is not longer than δmin5 (u, w), i.e., d5(p, u) ≤ δmin5 (u, w). Following the path via the point
p, we bound the distance dS(u, w) by 3d5(p, w) + 9d5(p, u), which in turn is bounded by

3d5(u, w) + 9δmin5 (u, w) as stated in the lemma.
(cid:73) Lemma 21. For any crossed white edge (u, w) ∈ D, dS(u, w) ≤ 10d5(u, w) + 10δmin5 (u, w).
Proof. Since there are no shortcuts on the blue side of a white anchor, all whites edges on
the blue side are uncrossed. Therefore, we can assume that (u, w) is a white edge on the
white side crossing a shortcut (p, q) in the same cone.

We consider two speciﬁc paths between u and w: path A which starts with the path for
(p, w) as discussed in Lemma 19 and then follows the canonical path from p to u; and path B
which starts with the same path for (p, w), and then takes the shortcut from p to q, and then
follows the canonical path from q to u in the other direction. Considering both of the paths
A and B, we bound dS(p, w) by 9d5(p, w) + δblue5 (p, w) using Lemma 19. Also, for any blue
canonical edge (x, y) on the canonical path between p and q, we know that dS(x, y) ≤ 3d5(x, y)
by Lemmas 10 and 14. And, except for the ﬁrst white canonical edge (p, r), for any other
white canonical edge (x0, y0) on this path, we know that dS(x0, y0) ≤ 2d5(x0, y0) by Lemmas 10
and 15, because either these white canonical edges themselves or their anchors are in S.
The ﬁrst white canonical edge (p, r) and its anchor, however, may both be excluded from
S because of the shortcut (p, q). Thus, we can only bound dS(p, r) by the worse bound of
9d5(p, r) + δblue5 (p, r) using Lemmas 10 and 19. Using the fact that this cost has a much
worse multiplicative constant than all other white canonical edges, it can be veriﬁed that the
worst case happens when (p, r) is the only white canonical edge on the path from p to u.
We bound the total length of path A by 9d5(p, w) + δblue5 (p, w) for the edge (p, w), by
9d5(p, r) + δblue5 (p, r) ≤ 10d5(p, r) for the white canonical edges between p and u, and
by 3d5(r, u) for the blue canonical edges between p and u. Also, by using arguments
analogous to those used in the proof of Lemma 18, we observe that d5(p, r) ≤ d5(p, u) and
d5(r, u) ≤ δwhite5 (p, u). Therefore, the total cost of path A is bounded by

dS(u, w) ≤ 9d5(p, w) + δblue5 (p, w) + 13d5(p, u) − 3δblue5 (p, u).

Since (p, u) is a white canonical edge in a white cone, by Lemma 18, we can substitute
d5(p, u) = δblue5 (u, w) − δblue5 (p, w) and δblue5 (p, u) = d5(u, w) − d5(p, w). Hence, we get

dS(u, w) ≤ 12d5(p, w) − 12δblue5 (p, w) + 13δblue5 (u, w) − 3d5(u, w)

= 12δwhite5 (p, w) + 10δblue5 (u, w) − 3δwhite5 (u, w)
= 12δwhite5 (p, w) + 10d5(u, w) − 13δwhite5 (u, w)
= 10d5(u, w) + 10δwhite5 (u, w) + 12δwhite5 (p, w) − 23δwhite5 (u, w).
By using the fact that δwhite5 (p, w) ≤ d5(u, w) and rearranging (1) we get:

(1)

dS(u, w) ≤ 10δblue5 (u, w) + 20δwhite5 (u, w) + 10d5(u, w) + 2δwhite5 (p, w) − 23δwhite5 (u, w)

≤ 10d5(u, w) + 10δblue5 (u, w) + 2δwhite5 (p, w) − 3δwhite5 (u, w).

Hence, we conclude that dS(u, w) ≤ 10d5(u, w)+10δmin5 (u, w) if 2δwhite5 (p, w) ≤ 3δwhite5 (u, w).

Therefore, we assume 3δwhite5 (u, w) < 2δwhite5 (p, w) ≤ 2d5(u, w) = 2δwhite5 (u, w)+2δblue5 (u, w),
and derive δwhite5 (u, w) < 2δblue5 (u, w).
Next, we bound the total length of path B by 9d5(p, w) + δblue5 (p, w) for the edge (p, w),
by d5(p, q) for the shortcut, by 2d5(u, q) for the white canonical edges between p and u,
and by 3d5(u, q) for the blue canonical edges between p and u; thus in total by

dS(u, w) ≤ 9d5(p, w) + δblue5 (p, w) + d5(p, q) + 5d5(u, q).

XX:17

By the triangle inequality, we have d5(p, q) ≤ d5(p, u) + d5(u, q) and using once again

that d5(p, u) = δblue5 (u, w) − δblue5 (p, w), we bound the total cost of path B by

dS(u, w) ≤ 9d5(p, w) + δblue5 (u, w) + 6d5(u, q).
(2)
We further bound the cost of path B if d5(u, w) ≥ d5(q, w), in which case we observe
d5(u, q) ≤ δwhite5 (u, w). Using the inequality δwhite5 (u, w) < 2δblue5 (u, w), we rearrange (2)

dS(u, w) ≤ 9d5(p, w) + δblue5 (u, w) + 6d5(u, q)

≤ 9d5(p, w) + δblue5 (u, w) + 6δwhite5 (u, w)
≤ 10d5(u, w) + 5δwhite5 (u, w)
≤ 10d5(u, w) + 10δblue5 (u, w)
≤ 10d5(u, w) + 10δmin5 (u, w).

Therefore, we consider the remaining case d5(u, w) < d5(q, w). In this case, by Lemma 18,
we get δblue5 (u, q) = d5(q, w)− d5(u, w), and we also observe that δwhite5 (u, q) ≤ δwhite5 (u, w).
Combining them, we get d5(u, q) ≤ d5(q, w) − δblue5 (u, w), and rearrange (2) we get

dS(u, w) ≤ 9d5(p, w) + 6d5(q, w) − 5δblue5 (u, w).
Furthermore, using the earlier assumption that 3δwhite5 (u, w) < 2δwhite5 (p, w), and the
fact that δwhite5 (q, w) ≥ 0, we deduce that 3δblue5 (u, q) < 2δblue5 (p, u) + δblue5 (u, q). Using
Lemma 18 on all the three terms, we obtain d5(q, w) < 3d5(u, w) − 2d5(p, w). We then
rearrange (3)

(3)

dS(u, w) ≤ 9d5(p, w) + 18d5(u, w) − 12d5(p, w) − 5δblue5 (u, w)
= 10d5(u, w) + 8δwhite5 (u, w) + 3δblue5 (u, w) − 3d5(p, w)
≤ 10d5(u, w) + 8δwhite5 (u, w) + 3δblue5 (u, w) − 3δwhite5 (p, w)
≤ 10d5(u, w) + 7
≤ 10d5(u, w) + 10δblue5 (u, w).

2 δwhite5 (u, w) + 3δblue5 (u, w)

Therefore, what remains to be proven is dS(u, w) ≤ 10d5(u, w) + 10δmin5 (u, w) for the
case δmin5 (u, w) = δwhite5 (u, w). To prove this case, using (1), we will assume the stronger
inequality 7δwhite5 (u, w) < 4δwhite5 (p, w), and using arguments similar to those used in the
above paragraph, we get 3d5(q, w) < 7d5(u, w) − 4d5(p, w). Once again, we rearrange (3)

dS(u, w) ≤ 9d5(p, w) + 14d5(u, w) − 8d5(p, w) − 5δblue5 (u, w)

= 9d5(u, w) + d5(p, w) + 5δwhite5 (u, w)
≤ 10d5(u, w) + 5δwhite5 (u, w).

Proving dS(u, w) ≤ 10d5(u, w) + 10δmin5 (u, w) for all of the cases, we conclude that the
(cid:74)

statement of the lemma is correct.

XX:18 Degree Four Plane Spanners: Simpler and Better

By Lemmas 14, 19, 20, and 21 we have that S is a 20-spanner of D. Since D is a 2-spanner
of C ([11]) it follows that S is a spanner of C with stretch factor at most 40. We prove,
however, a much better bound of 20 next.
(cid:73) Lemma 22. For any two points p, q ∈ P, dS(p, q) is bounded by 20d5(p, q).
Proof. We prove the lemma by ﬁrst constructing, in D, a monotone path π between p and q
that lies inside 5(p, q). We then consider the path π0 in S obtained by replacing every edge
of π not in S with a short path in S.
We deﬁne the path π between p and q consisting of k edges in D using a sequence of
pairs of points {p, q} = {p0, q0},{p1, q1}, . . . ,{pk, qk} such that any two consecutive pairs of
points {pi−1, qi−1} and {pi, qi} satisfy exactly one of the equations pi = pi−1 and qi = qi−1
and the equation that is not satisﬁed describes the ith edge. If pi 6= pi−1, then the ith edge
is (pi−1, pi) ∈ D, otherwise the ith edge is (qi−1, qi) ∈ D. We deﬁne this sequence recursively
for the next pair of points {pi+1, qi+1} by ﬁrst identifying which of the points pi and qi lie in
the other’s positive cone. If qi lies in the positive cone of pi, then we deﬁne qi+1 = qi and
pi+1 = r such that (pi, r) ∈ D, noting that by deﬁnition of D, r is the unique such point in
the positive cone of pi that contains qi. Otherwise, if pi lies in a positive cone of qi, then we
deﬁne pi+1 = pi and qi+1 = r0 such that (qi, r0) ∈ D. We stop when pk = qk.
We prove inductively that the aforementioned path π lies within 5(p, q). For the base
case, clearly the path consisting of the only edge in the sequence {pk−1, qk−1},{pk, qk}
lies within 5(pk−1, qk−1). For the inductive step, assuming that the path for the se-
quence {pi, qi}, . . . ,{pk, qk} lies within 5(pi, qi), we show that the path for the sequence
{pi−1, qi−1},{pi, qi}, . . . ,{pk, qk} lies within 5(pi−1, qi−1). First, we observe that in either
case that the ﬁrst edge is (pi−1, pi) or (qi−1, qi), it lies within 5(pi−1, qi−1) by deﬁnition.
Finally, we observe that 5(pi, qi), hence the rest of the path lies within 5(pi−1, qi−1) as well.
Therefore, we prove the inductive step.

We then prove that all of the edges of the form (pi, pi+1) lie in the same corresponding posi-
tive cones of their respective points pi. More speciﬁcally, we prove by induction on the sequence
of such edges e0 = (p = pi0−1, pi0), e1 = (pi0 = pi1−1, pi1), . . . , e‘ = (pi‘−1 = pi‘−1, pi‘ = pk),
that pi0 , pi1 , . . . , pi‘ lie in the same corresponding cones of pi0−1, pi1−1, . . . , pi‘−1 respectively.
The base case follows trivially, and for the inductive step we assume for edges e0, e1, . . . , eλ
that pi0 , pi1, . . . , piλ lie in the same corresponding cones of pi0−1, pi1−1, . . . , piλ−1 respectively.
For the inductive step we need to prove for the edge eλ+1 that piλ+1 lies in the same
corresponding cone of piλ+1−1 = piλ. We have already proven that the edge eλ+1 lies within
5(piλ, qiλ). Also, by deﬁnition of D, we know that 5(piλ−1, piλ) is empty of points of P in
its interior. Then we conclude the inductive proof by observing that the only positive cone
that can possibly include eλ+1 at piλ is part of the same corresponding cone of piλ. Having
proven this critical property about this path, we denote it by πp and refer to it as one of the
two branches, where the other branch πq is deﬁned analogously using points q0, q1, . . . , qk.
We conclude that the path π consisting of these two branches πp and πq is monotone.

Finally, we prove the claimed bound on the length of the path π0 between p and q.
Because the constants in Lemma 21 are the largest among Lemmas 14, 19, 20, and 21, the
worst case happens when q lies in the white positive cone of p and π is white monotone.
Let z be the blue vertex of 5(p, q). By Lemma 6: the projections of all edges of π onto
zp (resp. zq) do not overlap, are contained within [zp] (resp. zq), |zp| = d5(p, q), and
|zq| = δblue5 (p, q).
In the worst case, each edge of π is crossed, and Lemma 21 applies
to reconstruct each edge of π. Therefore, the length of π0 can be upper bounded by
10d5(p, q) + 10δmin5 (p, q) ≤ 10d5(p, q) + 10δblue5 (p, q) ≤ 20d5(p, q).

(cid:73) Theorem 23. S is a plane spanner of C with maximum degree 4 and stretch factor at most
20 that can be constructed in O(n log n) time.
Proof. The properties of S regarding planarity, maximum degree bound, and stretch factor
are proven by Lemmas 11, 13, and 22 respectively. The TD-Delaunay triangulation D can
be constructed in O(n log n) time [11]. Given D and the fact that it is planar, S can be
constructed in O(n log n) time: sorting the anchors takes O(n log n) time, and adding edges
to S can be done in O(n) time.

Tight degree bound for points in convex position

6
In this section, we show that if the set P of points is in convex position, then the same
spanner S constructed in the previous section has maximum degree at most 3. Therefore,
for any set of points P in convex position, there exists a plane spanner of C of maximum
degree at most 3. We also show in this section that 3 is a lower bound on the maximum
degree of plane spanners of C for point-sets in convex position. The preceding implies that
3 is a tight bound on the maximum degree of plane spanners of C for point-sets in convex
position, and this completely and satisfactorily answers the question about the maximum
degree of plane geometric spanners of C, in the case when P is in convex position.
(cid:73) Proposition 24. Let P be a set of points in convex position in the plane, and let S be
the spanner of C constructed as described in Section 4. Then the maximum degree of S is at
most 3.
Proof. Let p ∈ P. It suﬃces to show that the degree of p in S is at most 3. To this eﬀect,
we show that at most 3 edges incident to p could be added in steps 1 – 6 of the construction
of S. Since P is in convex position, there exists a support line, Dp, passing through p such
that all the points of P lie in one closed half plane, H, of the two half planes delimited by
Dp [17]. Observe that – by the construction of S – each of the two blue sectors of p contains
at most one edge incident to p in S. In Lemma 12, we showed that each of the at most 4
edges incident to a point p ∈ S is charged by the charging scheme (see Section 5) to one of
the 4 sectors LBp, RBp, U Wp, and LWp, such that each of the 4 sectors is charged with at
most one edge. In this charging scheme, a blue anchor at p is charged to the blue sector
containing it, and a white edge incident to p is either charged to a blue sector at p (and in
such case the blue sector does not contain a blue anchor), or to the white sector containing
the edge. We distinguish the following cases, based on the angle, α, that Dp makes with the
positive x-axis:

Case 1. 0 ≤ α ≤ π/3 (Dp passes through the two blue sectors at p). In this case the half plane H
entirely contains one of the two white sectors at p. Suppose that H contains U Wp; the
case is symmetric if H contains LWp. Since (1) each of the three sectors LBp, U Wp, and
RBp is charged with at most one edge incident to p, (2) each of LBp and RBp contains
at most one blue anchor incident to p, and (3) each edge incident to p in U Wp is either
charged to U Wp, LBp, or RBp, it follows that the number of edges incident to p in H,
and hence in S, is at most 3.
Case 2. π/3 ≤ α ≤ 2π/3 (Dp passes through the two red cones at p). Assume, to get a
contradiction, that there are 4 edges incident to p in H. Suppose ﬁrst that H entirely
contains RBp, and hence is disjoint from LBp. In this case the part of U Wp in H is
contained in a positive cone at p, and hence, there is at most one edge incident to p in
S that lies in H ∩ U Wp. Since each of the 4 sectors at p is charged with at most one

XX:20 Degree Four Plane Spanners: Simpler and Better

that of Case 2 above.

edge, it follows from the preceding that there is a white edge e incident to p in H ∩ LWp
that is charged to LBp. This could only happen if e, a white edge, is a canonical edge in
a blue cone, added according to step 3 in the spanner construction, and is charged to
LBp according to step 3 of the charging scheme. This, however, implies that LBp is not
empty (a white canonical edge e ∈ LWp in a blue cone could exist only if RBp contains
points of P), contradicting that all points of P lie in H. Suppose now that H entirely
contains LBp, and hence is disjoint from RBp. By the same token as above, there must
exist a white canonical edge, e, incident to p and lying in a white sector at p, that is
charged to LBp. By the charging scheme, the edge e cannot lie in U Wp because in such
case e would not be charged to U Wp. Therefore, e must lie in LWp. But then e must lie
in the negative cone adjacent to p in LWp, which is (the cone) disjoint from H, again
contradicting that H contains all points of P.
Case 3. 2π/3 ≤ α ≤ π (Dp passes through the two green cones at p). The proof is analogous to
(cid:74)
(cid:73) Proposition 25. For any constant ρ ≥ 1, there exists a point-set P in convex position
such that any plane spanner of C of maximum degree at most 2 has stretch factor > ρ.
Proof. Let ρ ≥ 1 be a given constant. Choose an integer b > ρ, and an integer N > 3(ρ·b+1).
Consider an orthogonal rectangle of vertical dimension a = N − 1 and horizontal dimension
b. Let n = 2N, and let P = {p1, . . . , pN , q1, . . . , qN} be a set of n points placed on the
rectangle as follows. Points p1, . . . , pN are placed on one vertical side of the rectangle such
that |pipi+1| = 1, for i = 1, . . . , N − 1, so that p1 and pN end up on the two vertices of
the vertical side of the rectangle. Points q1, . . . , qN are placed symmetrically on the other
vertical side of the rectangle so that the piqi’s, i = 1, . . . , N, are all parallel. We note that
one can choose P to be in convex position while respecting the standard general position
assumptions (no 3 points on a line, etc.) by slightly modifying the set of points chosen above
(e.g., rotating each of pipi+1 and qiqi+1, i = 1, . . . , N, slightly but increasingly inwards (i.e.,
towards the interior of the rectangle), and slightly modifying the choice of the parameters
a, b, N. However, we decided to go with the above conﬁguration for clarity and ease of
presentation.
Suppose, to get a contradiction, that there is a plane spanner S of C of maximum degree
at most 2 and stretch factor ρ. Since S is connected, S is either a Hamiltonian path or
a Hamiltonian cycle. Without loss of generality, we will assume in what follows that S is
a Hamiltonian cycle, as the proof in the other case is simpler. Let L = {p1, . . . , pN} and
R = {q1, . . . , qN}. We distinguish the following two cases:

Case 1. The subgraph of S induced by either L or R is disconnected. Suppose that the subgraph
of S induced by L, SL, is disconnected; the proof follows by symmetry in the other case.
Then there must exist i ∈ {1, . . . , N − 1} such that the two consecutive points pi, pi+1
belong to two diﬀerent connected components of SL. Therefore, any path between pi
and pi+1 in S must contain an edge prqs, r, s ∈ {1, . . . , N}. Since the distance between
any point from L and any point from R is at least b, we have |prqs| ≥ b. It follows that
the length of any path in S between pi and pi+1 is at least b > ρ = ρ · |pipi+1|, which
contradicts that S is a spanner of stretch factor ρ.

Case 2. Each of the two subgraphs SL and SR of S, induced by L and R, respectively, is connected.
Then each of SL and SR must be a Hamiltonian path on L and R, respectively. Let pr
and ps, r, s ∈ {1, . . . , N}, be the points of degree 1 in SL, and qr0, qs0, r0, s0 ∈ {1, . . . , N},
be those of degree 1 in SR. Since S is a Hamiltonian cycle, S consists of the edges in the

I. Kanj, L. Perković, D. Türkoğlu

r, q0

Hamiltonian path SL, the edges in the Hamiltonian path SR, plus a matching between
{pr, ps} and q0
s, say prpr0 and qsqs0. Since there are N points in L, there must exist a
point pi ∈ L, i ∈ {1, . . . , N}, such that the number of edges on each of the two subpaths
between pi and pr and between pi and ps in SL, is at least N/3 − 1 > ρ · b by the choice
of N. Consider point qi ∈ R. Any path between pi and qi in S must contain either the
subpath of SL between pi and pr, or the subpath of SL between pi and ps, and hence
must contain more than ρ · b edges of SL. Since each edge of SL has length at least 1,
the length of any path between pi and qi in S is more than ρ · b = ρ · |piqi|. This again
contradicts the assumption that S has stretch factor ρ, and completes the proof.

(cid:74)

We conclude with the following theorem:

(cid:73) Theorem 26. The constant 3 is a tight bound on the maximum degree of geometric plane
spanners of C for point-sets in convex position.
