ABSTRACT

We present the ﬁrst results from our X-ray study of young radio sources classiﬁed as Compact
Symmetric Objects (CSOs). Using the Chandra X-ray Observatory we observed six CSOs for the ﬁrst
time in X-rays, and re-observed four CSOs with previous XMM-Newton or Beppo-SAX data. We also
included six other CSOs with the archival data to built a pilot sample of the 16 CSO sources observed
in X-rays to date. All the sources are nearby, z < 1, and the age of their radio structures (< 3000 years)
has been derived from the hotspots advance velocity. Our results show heterogeneous nature of the
CSOs X-ray emission indicating a complex environment associated with young radio sources. The

sample covers a range in X-ray luminosity, L2−10 keV ∼ 1041–1045 erg s−1, and intrinsic absorbing
column density of NH (cid:39) 1021–1022 cm−2.
In particular, we detected extended X-ray emission in
1718−649, a hard photon index of Γ = 0.8+0.3−0.2 in 2021+614 consistent with either a Compton thick
absorber or non-thermal emission from compact radio lobes; an ionized iron emission line, Erest =
(6.62 ± 0.04) keV, EW = 154+65−58 eV (for a power law and a Gaussian line model), in 0710+439; and
the 2–10 keV X-ray ﬂux decrease by an order of magnitude since the 2008 XMM-Newton observation
in 1607+26. We conclude that our pilot study of CSOs provides a variety of exceptional diagnostics
and highlights the importance of deep X-ray observations of large samples of young sources. This is
necessary in order to constrain theoretical models for the earliest stage of radio source evolution and
study the interactions of young radio sources with the interstellar environment of their host galaxies.

INTRODUCTION

Theory and simulations predict that radio sources are
the most luminous when they start growing within the
very central regions of their host galaxies (Scheuer 1974;
Begelman & Cioﬃ 1989; Begelman 1996; Readhead et al.
1996a; Heinz et al. 1998). During this initial expansion
a radio source is expected to interact strongly with the
interstellar medium (ISM), inducing shocks, accelerat-
ing particles, heating the ISM and accelerating gas form-
ing an outﬂow (Begelman et al. 1984; Begelman & Cioﬃ
1989; Bicknell et al. 1997; Silk & Rees 1998; Reynolds
et al. 2001). Empirical evidence for such interactions
comes from observations of galactic scale X-ray struc-
tures in nearby radio galaxies (e.g. Kraft et al. 2000;
Mingo et al. 2011; Siemiginowska et al. 2012; Hardcastle
et al. 2012), as well as from correlations between veloc-
ities of optical line-emitting gas and the morphology of
radio outﬂows in parsec scale radio sources (Morganti et
al. 2003; Holt et al. 2003; Morganti et al. 2013; Tadhunter
et al. 2014). Such interactions, leading to energy ex-
change between a radio source and the ISM, are thought
to contribute to feedback that governs the evolution of
galaxies over cosmological time scales (e.g. Best et al.
2006; Croton et al. 2006). At present, though, we have

only been able to study such interactions in relatively
old, > 104 − 105 yrs, large radio sources, while studies
of young compact systems have been limited. Although
the youngest sources would only impact the very central
regions of their galaxy, they can strongly inﬂuence the
sites directly responsible for the AGN fuel supply, e.g.,
by heating and accelerating material away from the cen-
tral regions (e.g. Bicknell et al. 1997; Holt et al. 2008;
Wagner & Bicknell 2011). Thus, these youngest sources
could be critical to our understanding of the feedback
processes impacting galaxy evolution.

The existing velocity measurements of radio hot spots
and spectral aging studies indicate that Compact Sym-
metric Objects (CSOs), a subclass of GigaHertz-Peaked
Spectrum (GPS) sources, are among the youngest ex-
tragalactic radio sources, with ages between ∼100 and
3000 yrs (Owsianik & Conway 1998; Taylor et al. 2000;
An et al. 2012). Interestingly, there seems to be an ex-
cess of CSOs younger than ∼500 yrs (Gugliucci et al.
2005). This excess together with a large number of com-
pact radio sources (< 1 kpc) in comparison to large size
radio galaxies (O’Dea & Baum 1997) may suggest that
the radio jet activity is intermittent (Reynolds & Begel-
man 1997; Czerny et al. 2009; Shulevski et al. 2012) or
that the compact sources are short-lived (Readhead et
al. 1996b; Kunert-Bajraszewska et al. 2010, 2015). In ei-

∗ Many diﬀerent age estimates are given in the literature for each source, as the measurements depend on radio frequency, radio components and
the number of epochs. Thus, the systematic errors could be 20%-40% and therefore we only use the age in general discussion and do not perform
any statistical correlations with age.

ther case the youngest CSOs expand within the central
(≈ 100 pc) regions of the galaxies and contribute to the
feedback.
The young age of the CSO sources has been challenged
by a frustrated jet scenario in which the presence of a
dense medium forces the jets to decelerate rapidly and
prevents them from propagating beyond the central par-
sec scale regions (van Breugel et al. 1984; Gopal-Krishna
& Wiita 1991; De Young 1993; Carvalho 1994; De Young
1997; Perucho 2015). This would introduce a systematic
bias to the kinematic age measurements. However, un-
til now there has been no evidence for a dense enough
medium to halt the jets of GPS sources, and this lack of
evidence gives further support to the youth scenario (e.g.,
Morganti 2008; see however, Garc´ıa-Burillo et al. 2007).
At the same time, recent broad-band low frequency radio
observations reveal inhomogeneous absorber surrounding
compact radio lobes in a few CSOs (e.g. Tingay et al.
2015; Callingham et al. 2015) implying that complex in-
teractions between expanding jets and the surrounding
medium do take place. X-ray observations of CSOs can
potentially resolve this issue by providing evidence in fa-
vor or against the presence of dense obscuring matter
able to frustrate the jets in the youngest sources.

In general the GPS sources are faint in X-rays and
studying them in this waveband became possible only
during the last decade, thanks to the Chandra X-ray
Observatory (e.g., Siemiginowska et al. 2008; Kunert-
Bajraszewska et al. 2014) and XMM-Newton (e.g.,
Guainazzi et al. 2006; Vink et al. 2006; Tengstrand et
al. 2009). The early X-ray results indicate that the GPS
X-ray emission could be intrinsically absorbed, although
the absorption properties of the GPS sources are simi-
lar to those found in general source populations. The

intrinsic GPS X-ray radiation could be related to the ac-
cretion, to expanding radio lobes, to relativistic jets, or
in some cases to the thermal hot medium found in the
central regions of the host galaxy (Guainazzi et al. 2006;
Stawarz et al. 2008; Ostorero et al. 2010; Migliori et al.
2011, 2012, 2014).

However, only a few CSO sources with known redshift
and measured age has been observed in X-rays (e.g.,
Guainazzi et al. 2006; Risaliti et al. 2003; Vink et al.
2006). Thus, we initiated our Chandra program to study
the CSO sample deﬁned by requiring the availability of
kinematic age measurements and z < 1 (Section 2). Our
main goal was to establish the X-ray properties of these
CSOs, determine the origin of their X-ray emission, and
study the properties of the environment into which they
are expanding. We describe our methods of X-ray data
analysis in Section 3, and present the X-ray analysis re-
sults in Section 4. We discuss the implications of the CSO
X-ray properties on the models of the high-energy pro-
cesses in compact radio sources in Section 5 and conclude
our ﬁndings in Section 6. We use the most recent con-
straints on the cosmological parameters to convert the
observed ﬂuxes into luminosities (Hinshaw et al. 2013;
H0 = 69.3 km s−1 Mpc−1, Ωm = 0.287 implemented as
WMAP9 in the astropy.cosmology package, Astropy
Collaboration et al. (2013)).

2. SAMPLE

We compiled from the literature a sample of 16 CSO
sources with redshift and expansion velocity of the radio
hot spots available at the time of our proposed Chandra
project. Table 1 lists these sources and their general
radio properties (the linear size, LS (cid:39) 2–120 kpc; the
expansion velocity, v (cid:39) 0.07–0.4 c; and the age inferred

version 4.4. We processed the data by running CIAO
tool acis-process-events and applied the newest cal-
ibration ﬁles, ﬁltered VFAINT background events, and
ran a sub-pixel event-repositioning algorithm (and set
pix adj=EDSER). This ﬁnal step provides the highest an-
gular resolution X-ray image data for the most up-to-date
ACIS-S calibration. All spectral modeling was done in
Sherpa1 (Freeman et al. 2001; Refsdal et al. 2009). We
used the Cash and Cstat ﬁtting statistics (Cash 1979)
and the Nelder-Mead optimization method (Nelder &
Mead 1965).

through the kinematic argument, τ ∼100–3000 yrs).
We obtained the new Chandra observations of 10
CSOs. We observed the six CSOs with no prior X-
ray information (5 ksec exposures). Additionally, we im-
aged with Chandra the two sources observed previously
with BeppoSAX (1946+708, 5 ksec; 1934−63, 20 ksec),
or with XMM-Newton (0710+439, 38 ksec; 1607+26,
38 ksec). The goal of the long, 20–40 ksec, exposures
was to study in detail the CSO environments through
the high-resolution spatial and spectral analysis. Table 2
contains the log of our Chandra observations. It includes
also J1511+0518 with archival 2 ksec Chandra data.

Figure 1 shows the distribution of CSOs kinematic ages
for 16 sources in our pilot study and 7 additional sources
from An & Baan (2012) with their ages measured after
our Chandra program has been completed. The uncer-
tainties on the age measurements are typically within
20 − 40% and related to the quality of the radio moni-
toring data. Note that our X-ray sample contains all the
youngest CSOs with the ages < 400 years.

In summary, Table 1 contains a complete list of CSO
sources with derived redshift and kinematic age that have
been observed in X-rays to date, while Table 2 contains
the sources analyzed in this paper. With our Chandra
program, we have increased the size of the CSO X-ray
sample by ∼68%.

3. CHANDRA X-RAY OBSERVATIONS AND DATA

ANALYSIS

The Chandra ACIS-S data were collected during the
2010–2011 epoch (see Table 2 for details). All targets
were placed at the aim point on the back-illuminated
ACIS CCD (S3).
The observations were made in
VFAINT mode with 1/8 CCD readout to avoid pileup
if sources were to be bright. All 10 targets were de-
tected by Chandra with a number of counts between 3
and 1,677.

The X-ray data analysis was performed with the CIAO
version 4.6 software (Fruscione et al. 2006) using CALDB

We inspected the Chandra data using ds9 and visually
conﬁrmed the location of each source, and also deﬁned
the source and background regions for further spectral

× 10(cid:48)(cid:48) ACIS-

extractions. Figure 2 displays the ∼ 10(cid:48)(cid:48)

S images of all the targets (denoted in the panels with
green circles), except for 0116 + 319 which is detected
with 3 counts only (p − value (cid:28) 0.01)2. The target is
the brightest source in the image. We stress that due
to the diﬀerent redshifts of our CSO sources, the Chan-
dra observations probe physical scales that diﬀer by ∼1.5
orders of magnitude (0.4–11.2 kpc; Figure 2).
Hints of extended X-ray emission in the three
sources with the highest number of counts (0710+0439,
1718−649, 1934−638), or a secondary X-ray source (in
1607+268) could be seen in the images. We investigated
the signiﬁcance of the extended X-ray emission using sur-
face brightness analysis. We compared the observed sur-
face brightness proﬁles to the CHART3 simulated PSF pro-
ﬁle expected for a point source.

3.2. Spectral Analysis

The X-ray spectra and corresponding calibration ﬁles
(arf and rmf) were extracted with the CIAO script
specextract for all the sources. We assumed a circular
region with 1.5(cid:48)(cid:48) radius centered on the position of each
source for the spectral extraction. A local background
was extracted assuming an annulus with inner and outer
radii equal to 1.7(cid:48)(cid:48) and 10(cid:48)(cid:48), respectively. We compared
the total number of counts and net counts for each source
(Table 2). We assessed that the background was negligi-
ble in all cases (< 1 count in the source extraction region
for all targets, except for 0710+439 with 2.1 counts, e.g.
< 0.1% of the source counts), and therefore we ignored
it during the spectral analysis (i.e. we modeled only the
source spectra).

We applied an absorbed power law model to the spec-

two absorption components, Galactic and intrinsic to the
source. In the Sherpa nomenclature, this baseline spec-
tral model was deﬁned as xsphabs*xszphabs*powlaw1d

intrinsic absorption column was allowed to vary. The
photon index Γ was ﬁxed to 1.7 (a typical value for un-
absorbed NH < 1022 cm−2 AGN, Burlon et al. 2011)
while modeling the sources with a low number of counts,
< 12, in order to obtain a limiting value or detection of
the intrinsic absorption. The range of the photon index
1.4 < Γ < 2.0 results in the intrinsic column density
consistent to within 1σ with the values listed in Table 3.
The photon index was a free parameter in sources with
a larger number of counts.

4. RESULTS

We detected X-ray emission associated with all the
CSOs in our Chandra sample. However, because the

majority of our Chandra observations were short, de-
signed for X-ray detections, the detailed analysis were
only possible for about half of the sources in the sam-
In the short ∼5 ksec observations the detected
ple.
source counts ranged from 3 to 231 counts (see Ta-
ble 2). The background in such a short Chandra ob-
servation of a point source is very low and even 3 counts
in 0116+319 constitute a detection at high signiﬁcance
level (p-value < 0.01). However, we can only provide a
limiting ﬂux in this case, while for the other sources we
were able to extract Chandra spectrum and apply para-
metric models.

The three longer exposures provided data of high
enough sensitivity to explore the CSOs X-ray environ-
ment on arcsecond scales. We extracted the X-ray sur-
face brightness proﬁles assuming the annuli regions cen-
tered on the radio source position to quantify the pres-

ence of an X-ray emission outside the central point
source. In two cases, 0710+0439 and 1934−638, the pro-
ﬁles are consistent with the background level outside a
∼6(cid:48)(cid:48) radius. The residuals in the innermost circular re-

gions deviate slightly from zero suggesting a possibility
of an additional emission component. However, the for-
mal signiﬁcance test gives a p-value of 0.33, which does
not allow us to reject the null hypothesis that the source
is point-like. We concluded that in these two sources

the observed X-ray emission originates in an unresolved
region within r < 1.5(cid:48)(cid:48) (corresponding to < 9.5 kpc and
< 4.7 kpc for each source, respectively). There is no ex-
tended X-ray emission on large scales detected above the
background level of 0.0048 cts arcsec−2.

served emission above the PSF proﬁle is visible at the dis-

position indicating an extended X-ray emission present
in this source. We add another model component (the
standard beta model, beta1d in Sherpa; King 1962) to
account for this emission. We obtained a 1σ lower limit
of β > 0.55 in our best ﬁt model. Deep Chandra obser-
vations are needed to better constrain the properties of
this emission.

In general, our baseline absorbed power law model pro-
vided a good description of the X-ray continua of the
CSO sources. The modeling results are given in Ta-
ble 3 which displays the Galactic and intrinsic absorption
columns, photon index, and the unabsorbed ﬂux in the
soft (0.5–2 keV) and hard (2–10 keV; extrapolated from
the model ﬁtted over the 0.5–7 keV band) X-ray bands.
The uncertainties are given as 1σ for one interesting pa-
rameter. In six CSOs the photon index was a free pa-
rameter and we obtained Γ (cid:39) 1.4–1.7, with the exception
of 2021+614, where Γ = 0.8+0.3−0.2. The intrinsic absorp-
tion component was required at > 2σ conﬁdence level in
three CSOs (0710+439, 1946+708, and 0035+227; note
though that in 0035+227 the photon index was ﬁxed at
1.7) with N z
In two other
cases (2021+614 and 1607+26) we were able to derive
only upper limits on the intrinsic column densities (but
see Section 4.2). The X-ray spectra of the remaining
ﬁve sources are suggestive of the presence of an intrinsic
H (cid:39) 1021–
absorbing neutral hydrogen column with N z
1022 cm−2, although at low statistical signiﬁcance.
Even though we detected an extended X-ray emission
in 1718−649, the lowest redshift CSO in our sample, we
ﬁnd that the X-ray spectrum of this source is suﬃciently
modeled with an absorbed power law. However, our
Chandra spectrum has only 224±15 counts (see Table 3)
and any detailed analysis of potential contributions from
emission associated with the extended medium would re-
quire higher quality X-ray data.

H (cid:39) (0.6–1.7) × 1022 cm−2.

Below we provide a detailed description of the X-ray re-
sults for three particular CSOs in our sample: 0710+439
has a hard band narrow emission line (Section 4.1);
2021+614 has an extremely hard X-ray photon index
compared to typical AGN (Section 4.2); and 1607+26
is accompanied by a secondary X-ray source resolved

within the prior XMM-Newton extraction region (Sec-
tion 4.3). W also comment on 1934−63 and 1946+708
observed previously with Beppo-SAX and revisited with
our Chandra program (Section 4.4).

4.1. 0710+439

The photon index and the amount of intrinsic absorp-
tion in our Chandra spectrum of 0710+439 agree very
well with the earlier XMM-Newton results of Vink et
al. (2006). The source did not vary between the XMM-
Newton and Chandra observations showing consistent 2–

10 keV ﬂux of 4.1 × 10−13 erg cm−2 s−1. However, we

ﬁnd clear residuals in the hard X-ray band suggestive
of the presence of an emission line (Figure 4, top/left).
To account for this feature we added a Gaussian compo-
nent to the absorbed power-law spectral model (Model
B in Table 4; Figure 4, top/right). The line is unre-
solved (σ = 10 eV; ﬁxed) with the best ﬁt line energy
of E = 6.62 ± 0.04 keV (rest frame) and the equivalent
width EW = 154+65−58 eV. Visual inspection of the XMM-
Newton modeling presented by Vink et al. (2006) tenta-
tively hints at the presence of an emission line at similar
energy also in the XMM-Newton dataset.

Emission lines at the energies within ∼6.4–6.9 keV due
to iron are common in X-ray spectra of accreting black
holes (Krolik & Kallman 1987; George & Fabian 1991;
Zycki & Czerny 1994), including radio-quiet and non-
blazar radio-loud AGN (e.g., Hardcastle et al. 2009, Win-
ter et al. 2010; Fukazawa et al. 2011; Zhou, Zhao & Soria
2011) and Galactic black hole binaries (e.g., Done et al.
2007). In particular, a narrow ﬂuorescent neutral Fe Kα
line at 6.4 keV (rest frame) seems to be omnipresent in
the spectra of radiatively eﬃcient AGN (Bianchi et al.
2004; Nandra et al. 2007; Iwasawa et al. 2012; and
references therein), and is believed to originate from a
cold matter, e.g. a molecular torus, illuminated by hard
X-rays.

Narrow ∼6.6–6.9 keV emission lines from an ionized
iron have been observed e.g.
in luminous PG quasars,
including a radio-loud source Mrk 1383 (Porquet et al.
2004), and in a substantial fraction of Seyfert 1 galaxies
(Patrick et al. 2012). These lines could be emitted by a

hot ionized region of an accretion disk illuminated by an
external X-ray source (e.g., Matt et al. 1993; R´o˙za´nska
et al. 2002); a distant gas, photoionized by the nuclear
illumination (e.g., Bianchi & Matt 2002); or a diﬀuse
thermal plasma at kT (cid:38) 5 keV (Smith et al. 2001)

The best ﬁt parameters of the line detected in
0710+439 assuming Model B (see Table 4) are con-
sistent with the ﬁrst scenario and with the He-like Fe
XXV line emission4 in a system with an inclination an-
gle cos i (cid:39) 0.5–0.6 and an accretion rate ˙M (cid:39) 0.4 ˙MEdd
(Matt et al. 1993). However, in order to study the origin
of this emission line in more details we also tested four
other spectral models of increased complexity that are
typically considered for AGN X-ray emission(Table 4).
Given the quality of the current data all the models are
statistically equivalent, but considering the range of the
best ﬁt parameters we can potentially rule out some of
them.

First, we parametrized the X-ray continuum with a
thermal bremsstrahlung model (zbremss) and kept the
Gaussian proﬁle to ﬁt the emission feature (Model C in
Table 4). We found a statistically good ﬁt, but with a
relatively high temperature, kT ∼ 14 keV. Next, we re-
placed the bremsstrahlung continuum with a single tem-
perature plasma (mekal) model (metal abundances ﬁxed
at 0.5 the Solar value) and found that at this high tem-
perature the strength of the ionized Fe lines was over-
predicted, especially at the energy of the fully ionized
Fe XXVI, while the data did not provide evidence for
the presence of the Fe XXVI line. Similar result was ob-
tained when we used the apec plasma model instead of
the mekal model. Hence we concluded that single com-
ponent thermal models are not likely given the physical
properties required by the best ﬁt parameters. There-
fore, we tried a two-component model, consisting of a
power law and either mekal or apec (Models D and E in
Table 4). We obtained the best ﬁt plasma temperature
kT ∼ 5 keV, and a hard photon index, Γ = 1.4–1.5, which
are consistent with the prediction of jet/lobe emission.
Finally, we tested a model in which the spectrum is
composed of the intrinsically absorbed primary emission
(intrinsic emission modeled with a power law) and an
unabsorbed fraction of the same emission scattered by a
warm medium. The warm medium is also producing the
iron emission line (Model F in Table 4). In this scenario
the photon index is Γ = 1.75+0.11−0.10, the primary contin-
H (cid:39) 1022 cm−2, and
uum is absorbed with a column of Nz
the scattering fraction is ∼13 %. The EW of the line
(computed with respect to the scattered continuum) is
∼1.4 keV, in agreement with the values found by Bianchi
& Matt (2002) for column densities of the order of a few
×1021 cm−2 (see their Figure 4). The best ﬁt parameters

of the models A, B, E and F, and the ratio of the data to
the models are presented in Figure 4. We conclude that
with the present data we are not able to state if the soft
X-rays and the He-like iron line in 0710+439 are due to
scattered nuclear emission (Models B or F) or thermal
emission of the ISM heated through interactions with the
expanding jet (Models D and E).

4 The line is most probably a blend of not resolved resonance
(6.700 keV), intercombination (6.682 keV and 6.668 keV), and for-
bidden (6.637 keV) lines.

The neutral iron Kα line has been previously reported
in CSO sources observed with XMM-Newton (OQ 208,
2004; and 1607+26, Tengstrand et
Guainazzi et al.
al. 2009), while Risaliti et al.
(2003) detected neutral
and highly ionized (E (cid:39) 6.9 keV) iron emission lines
in 1934−638 and 1946+708 (respectively) using Beppo-
SAX. These two emission lines are not present in the low
counts Chandra spectra5 of 1607+26 (see Sec. 4.3) and
of the two Beppo-SAX sources (see Sec. 4.4).

M¨uller et al. (2015) detected a narrow emission line in
a CSO candidate (PMN J1603−4904), and derived the
redshift of the source assuming that the most likely rest
frame energy of the line is 6.4 keV. The presence of a
mildly ionized Fe line in the spectrum of 0710+439 indi-
cates that there might be a systematic error in the red-
shift derivation of PMN J1603−4904 because of a range
of ionization states of iron producing the emission lines
in the CSO sources.

Lastly, we note that 0710+439 has the highest number
of counts (1,679) among the sources in our sample. The
remaining CSOs were detected with 3–362 counts. A
higher number of counts in Chandra spectra are needed
for detecting narrow spectral features.

4.2. 2021+614

The absorbed power-law model ﬁt to the spectrum of
2021+614 resulted in an unusually hard photon index of
Γ = 0.8 ± 0.5. Typically, such a low value indicates a
strong nuclear obscuration able to cover completely the
source of the primary X-ray radiation. The observed
spectrum is then dominated by a Compton reﬂection
hump (and an accompanying neutral iron line) from a
distant material, presumably a molecular torus, result-
ing in an artiﬁcially low photon index. AGN with these
properties are called ‘Compton thick’, and the amount
of the hydrogen absorbing column required to distort
the X-ray spectrum in this manner is NH (cid:38) 1024 (e.g.,
Comastri 2004). The ﬁrst radio-loud Compton thick
AGN was found in OQ 208, a CSO source observed with
XMM-Newton by Guainazzi et al. (2004). Tengstrand et
al. (2009) speculated that 1607+26 is also a Compton
thick CSO. They based their argument on the photon
index Γ = 0.4 ± 0.3 obtained when an absorbed power-
law model was applied to the XMM-Newton data of this
source. By analogy with OQ 208 and 1607+26, it is likely
that 2021+614 is a Compton thick CSO candidate. Our
result on the intrinsic absorption in this source would
then be signiﬁcantly underestimated because in our ﬁt
we do not account for the column density that would
be needed to absorb the primary continuum.
Indeed,
when we ﬁt the data of 2021+614 with the sum of an in-
trinsically absorbed power law and unabsorbed reﬂection
(pexrav) component we obtain Cstat/d.o.f. = 209/442,
(cid:38) 9.5 × 1023 cm−2. The resulting photon index of
N z
H
the underlying power law would be, however, very soft,
Γ = 3.3 ± 0.3, and the unabsorbed intrinsic 2–10 keV lu-
minosity would increase by an order of magnitude mak-
ing 2021+614 the second CSO in our sample (in addition
to 0710+439) to exceed LX ∼ 1044 erg s−1 (comparable
5 p-values of 0.9 for 1934−63 and 0.4 for 1946+708 when test-
ing for the line with the null hypothesis of the power law model,

(plot pvalue in Sherpa).

to the Eddington luminosity of a 106 M(cid:12) black hole).

On the other hand, we do not see any evidence for
the presence of a neutral iron line in the spectrum of
2021+614. We derive only an upper limit on the EW of
this line, EW < 0.7 keV, inconsistent with the range de-
rived by Matt et al. (1996; EW = 1.3–2.7 keV). This may
be due to either our low quality data (only 54 counts col-
lected in our 5 ksec Chandra observation), or the actual
lack of this feature in the spectrum. Thus, it is inter-
esting to note that the low X-ray photon index and the
low intrinsic absorption can be understood in the con-
text of a non-thermal X-ray lobe emission model for the
GPS/CSO sources (Ostorero et al. 2010).

Unfortunately, the quality of our present Chandra data
is not suﬃcient to discriminate between these two hy-
(cid:38)
potheses for the X-ray emission in 2021+614: a N z
H
1024 cm−2 Compton-thick absorption vs. the X-ray lobe
emission. Deeper X-ray observations with Chandra or
XMM-Newton accompanied with the hard > 10 keV
band exposures (NuSTAR) would be needed in order to
resolve this issue.

4.3. 1607+26

Owing to the superior spatial resolution of Chan-
dra we resolve the source region of 1607+26 observed
with XMM-Newton by Tengstrand et al. (2009) into
two point-like X-ray sources (see Figure 2). The lo-
cation of 1607+26 matches the position of the upper
left source visible in Figure 2 with the detected 213

counts. The secondary source separated by ∼13.5(cid:48)(cid:48)

(lower right corner in Figure 2) has 32 counts and its
spectrum could be modeled with an absorbed power
law (assuming only Galactic absorption since the red-
shift to the source is unknown) with a photon index
Γ = 1.4 ± 0.3 (see Table 3). This means that the XMM-
Newton spectrum obtained by Tengstrand et al. (2009)
represents a combination of emission from 1607+26 and
from the secondary source. We detect an order of
magnitude decrease between the hard X-ray ﬂuxes of

XMM-Newton (4.2 × 10−13 erg s−1 cm−2) and Chandra
(4.8×10−14 erg s−1 cm−2). This change is larger than the

sum of the ﬂuxes from the two sources, and it is larger
than the absolute calibration uncertainties between the
Chandra and XMM-Newton satellites (Tsujimoto et al.
2011). Therefore, we concluded that the X-ray ﬂux of
one or both of the sources decreased during the ∼ 3 years
interval between the two observations.
We searched the SDSS, 2MASS and FIRST catalogs to
check the identiﬁcation of the secondary X-ray source,
but did not ﬁnd any corresponding emission.
If the
source were associated with 1607+26 then it would be
located ∼80 kpc away along the axis of the CSO radio
structure, on the extension of its radio jet (see Nagai et
al. (2006) for a discussion of the CSO radio morphology).
It is interesting to speculate that the observed secondary
X-ray source might be a hot spot due to the past radio
activity in the framework of the intermittent scenario for
the GPS sources. However, assuming the expansion ve-
locity of 0.34c (Table 1) the age of this feature would
be ∼1 Myr, while the terminal hot spots are expected
to die very quickly, on timescales ∼ 0.1 Myr once the
jet switches oﬀ (Carilli et al. 1988). Therefore, the na-
ture and the association of this secondary source with

1607+26 remains unclear.

Contrary to Tengstrand et al. (2009) who reported Γ =
0.4 ± 0.3 in 1607+26, we ﬁnd Γ = 1.4 ± 0.1, an X-ray
photon index that is fairly common in a population of
nearby radio-quiet and radio-loud AGN (e.g. Winter et
al. 2009, Fukazawa et al. 2011). We do not detect any
evidence of the neutral iron Kα line in the spectrum.
This line was, however, required by the XMM-Newton
data of Tengstrand et al. (2009) as part of their Compton
reﬂection dominated model for this source.

One explanation of this result could be that 1607+26
is a transitional Compton thick/thin AGN. Transitions
between the Compton thick and thin regimes have been
previously reported in the so-called ‘changing look’ AGN
(see, e.g., Matt et al. (2003); Risaliti et al. 2005; 2010;
2011; and references therein). The Compton thick/thin
switches are thought to be due to an X-ray absorber

made of clouds with NH (cid:39) 1023–1024 cm−2 crossing our

line of sight on timescales between hours and weeks.

If the ﬂux from the secondary source were constant be-
tween the two exposures, then 1607+26 would have been
(cid:38) 10 times brighter in the reﬂection dominated state
recorded with XMM-Newton than in our observation.
This clearly contradicts the ‘changing look’ AGN sce-
nario. To reconcile the hard X-ray ﬂux variability with
the ’changing look’ hypothesis, 1607+26 could not have
contributed more than ∼200 cts to the XMM-Newton
data, meaning that, the secondary X-ray source would
have to be (cid:38) 10 times brighter than 1607+26 in the
XMM-Newton observation. This would imply that the X-
rays detected and modeled by Tengstrand et al. (2009;
including the iron line) originated from the secondary
source rather than from 1607+26, eliminating any spec-
tral information about the state of 1607+26 during the
XMM-Newton observation. It would also indicate that
the photon index of the secondary source changed from
Γ ∼ 0.8 to ∼ 1.4, its iron line disappeared, and the hard
ﬂux increased by a factor of (cid:38) 70 between the two expo-
sures. These spectral properties would be very diﬃcult to
explain, especially with no radio, optical and γ-ray iden-
tiﬁcation available at present for the secondary source.
Thus, we reject the possibility that X-ray variability ob-
served in 1607+26 is due to the Compton thick/thin
switches.

The alternative explanations include fading of the nu-
clear and reﬂected 1607+26 emission, or a heavy obscu-
ration with a column density (cid:38) 1024 cm−2, as a result of
which Chandra would observed thermal emission of the
ISM. Finally, in the non-thermal scenario of Stawarz et
al. (2008) and Ostorero et al. (2010) any potential in-
trinsic variability of the X-ray continuum is expected to
take place on timescales much too long to account for
the results of the Chandra observations of 1607+26.

Clearly, future X-ray monitoring of this young radio
source is needed in order to determine its nature and
X-ray variability properties.

4.4. 1934−63 and 1946+708

Risaliti et al. (2003) reported that 1934−63 and
1946+708 showed Beppo-SAX spectra typical of the
Compton-thick sources with NH > 2.5 × 1024 cm−2,

strong Fe Kα line, and the reﬂection hump. They also
considered Compton-thin absorbers as a secondary ex-
planation of the data. We have revisited both sources

with Chandra. We could only obtain a 3σ upper limit
on the line equivalent width of < 0.96 keV in 1934−63
and of < 7.2 keV in 1946+708, assuming that the lines
are unresolved (σ = 10 eV) and located at the rest ener-
gies, 6.3 keV and 6.9 keV, respectively (as in Risaliti et
al. 2003). Future more sensitive X-ray observations are
needed to constrain the parameters of these lines.

We measure a relatively low intrinsic absorption col-

umn density in both sources (NH < 2 × 1022 cm−2) and

do not conﬁrm their Compton-thick nature (see Table 3).
We conclude that either the BeppoSAX spectra have been
contaminated by other X-ray sources in the ﬁeld, given
the 2 arcmin source extraction regions in the BeppoSAX
observations, or the Compton-thin model is more appro-
priate explanation of the data, or that these sources be-
long to the AGN class that switches between the Comp-
ton thick and thin states.

5. DISCUSSION

We have investigated properties of the high energy
emission in a sample of 16 young radio sources with
known redshift and kinematic age measurements of their
radio structures. All sources in our sample have symmet-
ric radio morphology, have been classiﬁed as CSOs and
have been associated with radio galaxies. They do not
display strong AGN emission in the optical band because
they either do not contain an optical-UV bump charac-
teristic of the AGN, or because the optical emission has
been absorbed by a dense medium in the central region
of the host galaxy. We detected six of the sources in our
sample for the ﬁrst time in X-rays.

5.1. Models for CSO X-ray emission

The angular sizes of the CSO radio emission are of
the order of miliarcseconds (e.g. Readhead et al. 1996b),
and as such are too small to be resolved with Chandra.
As a result, X-ray emission associated with any com-
pact radio jets, lobes, or bow shocks potentially present
around the lobes is integrated within the 1.5(cid:48)(cid:48) radius of
the circular source extraction region, corresponding to
0.4–11 kpc in our sources, depending on redshift. Con-
sequently, the CSOs X-ray emission contains informa-
tion on both the circumnuclear region (on sub-pc and
pc scale), and the surrounding ISM (kpc scale). Dif-
ferent physical processes may, thus, contribute to the
observed X-ray emission (see, e.g. Siemiginowska 2009,
for a review). The CSOs X-ray emission could arise
from the AGN nucleus (X-ray corona) indicating the na-
ture of the nucleus and its accretion state (Guainazzi
et al. 2004; Vink et al. 2006; Siemiginowska et al. 2008;
Tengstrand et al. 2009). However, if the absorption col-

umn is larger than ∼ 1024 cm−2, the nucleus could be

hidden and the observed X-rays would be dominated by
the thermal emission of the hot ISM from shocks driven
by the expanding jet (Heinz et al. 1998; O’Dea et al.
2000), or by a reprocessed nuclear emission due to the
reﬂection and/or scattering eﬀects (e.g. Guainazzi et al.
2006). On the other hand X-rays can also be emitted by
compact radio lobes through inverse-Comptonization of
local radiation ﬁelds (Stawarz et al. 2008; Ostorero et al.
2010; Migliori et al. 2012). These models result in dif-
ferent predictions on the X-ray photon index, amount of
intrinsic X-ray absorption, and the luminosity and could
be tested with deep observations.

The CSOs in our sample are rapidly expanding, as
demonstrated by their measured hot spot expansion ve-
locities spanning the 0.07–0.4 c range (Table 1, and refer-
ences therein). Based on these velocities, the CSOs kine-
matic age estimates range between ∼100 and 3000 yrs.
These are, thus, the youngest radio sources which can
provide information about the accretion state of super-
massive black holes shortly after the onset of the jet for-
mation, as well as about the properties of the environ-
ment into which the newly born jets are evolving, and
with which they are interacting.

5.1.1. Environment of CSO

(cid:38) 1024 cm−2 in 2021+614 (Section 4.2).

Jets and lobes in young radio sources, conﬁned to the
central parts (∼ 1 kpc) of their host galaxies, should
interact with a denser and less homogeneous medium
than their evolved (10s−100s kpc-long) analogs. Indeed,
our results support this idea. We detected multi-phase
galactic environments consisting of diverse gaseous com-
ponents co-spatial with the young expanding CSO ra-
dio structures: (1) the extended thermal component in
1718−649 (Section 3.1, Figure 3); (2) possibly an ionized
diﬀuse plasma giving rise to the He-like Fe emission line
in 0710+439 (Section 4.1, Figure 4); (3) neutral hydrogen
H (cid:39) 1021–1022 cm−2,
with moderate column density, N z
in the majority of the sources (Table 3, Figure 1, mid-
dle); (4) possibly a dense Compton-thick absorber with
N z
H
Recent multi-wavelength studies also provide evidence
that CSO radio sources are embedded in complex gaseous
environments. In the IR band the Spitzer data show a
variety of the IR line properties indicating an enhanced
star formation rates in host galaxies of compact radio
sources (Willett et al. 2010; Guillard et al. 2012; Dicken
et al. 2012). One explanation could be a jet-induced star
formation in CSOs (Labiano et al. 2008), suggestive of
the interactions between the jet and dense environment.
Tadhunter et al. (2011) points to a possible selection bias
in ﬂux limited radio samples that impacts general con-
clusions about the epoch of star formation and triggering
the radio source. However, these IR results are consis-
tent with the CSO source being embedded in a dense
environment.

In the radio band, Ger´eb et al. (2014, 2015) show that
the properties of the HI absorption line in the spectra
of GPS and compact steep spectrum sources (CSS; a
more evolved stage compared to the GPS sources) diﬀer
substantially from those of the extended radio sources.
Based on the correlation between the amount of HI ab-
sorption and the type of a radio source (∼55% HI de-
tection rate, and optical depths higher in the compact
sources than in the extended sources) the authors ar-
gued that the compact radio sources are embedded in
a medium that is rich in atomic gas. Moreover, the HI
kinematics in the GPS/CSS sources (broader and more
asymmetric, blue-shifted proﬁles) suggested that the gas
is unsettled and may form outﬂows. They concluded that
the evidence of interactions between the radio sources
and rich ambient environment is more frequent in the
young/compact sources than in the extended sources.

Finally, studies of the relationship between the X-ray
and radio absorbing columns reveal a correlation between
the NH and NHI absorption in GPS/CSO sources (Os-

Sy1.8–2 galaxies from the hard X-ray Swift/BAT sur-

to the jet axis, and as such should be compared with
type 2 AGN). In the sample of CSOs presented in Ta-

Instead, only

to be in a relatively good agreement with that found in
a Sy1.8–2 population of Burlon et al. (2011), especially
given the small size of our CSOs sample, the overabun-
dance of sources with only moderate intrinsic obscura-
tion seems puzzling. Hardcastle et al. (2009) pointed
out that the Narrow Line Radio Galaxies (NLRG), con-
sidered to be the more evolved analogues of CSO, have

the nuclear emission by a molecular torus. Consequently,
the large fraction of CSOs with hydrogen column densi-
ties lower than those typically found in NLRGs, may in-
dicate — echoing the conclusions of Ostorero et al. (2015)
— that the CSO X-ray obscuration is caused by the gas
located on much larger scales than molecular tori.

5.1.2. X-ray continuum of CSO

The 2–10 keV X-ray luminosities of our sources cover
>3 orders of magnitude (Figure 5 bottom), LX (cid:39) 2 ×
1041–6 × 1044 erg s−1, typical for the z < 1 AGN (e.g
Akylas et al. 2006; Winter et al. 2009; Fukazawa et al.
2011; Jia et al. 2013; Aird et al. 2015). Interestingly, we
observed that the oldest CSOs (t > 1000 years) tend to
be relatively bright in X-rays, with luminosities LX >
1043 erg s−1, while the youngest CSOs can be found at
any X-ray luminosity covered by the sample.

We found hard X-ray spectra with a photon index
Γ ∼ 1.4–1.7 in six (out of seven) sources, where we
were able to model the photon index. Among non-
blazar AGN, this range of photon indices is often seen
in radio-quiet AGN, although it appears to be the most
compatible with the average photon index of the non-
blazar radio-loud AGN (Reeves & Turner 2000; Kelly
et al. 2008; Sobolewska et al. 2009, 2011 but see Young
et al. 2009). The diﬀerence between the average X-ray
spectral slopes in radio-loud and radio-quiet AGN pop-
ulations may result from either a dilution of the X-ray
coronal emission, or a non-negligible contribution from
the non-thermal emission of jets (Belsole et al. 2006). It
is, thus, likely that in the particular case of CSOs the
X-ray jets and/or lobes contribute to the observed X-
ray radiation, as suggested by Stawarz et al. (2008) and
Ostorero et al. (2010). The photon indices we observed
would then be consistent with a non-thermal scenario in
which low-energy photons are inverse Compton upscat-
tered to X-ray energies by electrons with a power-law
spectral energy distribution with a rather standard spec-
tral index, p ∼ 2.

torero et al. 2015), suggesting that the X-ray and radio
absorbers are co-spatial. This is an important constraint,
given the latest radio results from the low frequency radio
observations (Callingham et al. 2015). They seem to rule
out the synchrotron self absorption process and favor the
free-free absorption as the origin of the radio obscuration
in the GPS source, PKS B0008−42. This again points to
a rich, multi-phase environment impacting the evolution
of CSOs.

It is, thus, interesting to interpret our ﬁndings on the
CSOs intrinsic neutral hydrogen column density in the
context of the absorption properties of an unbiased pop-

Thus, the shape of the absorbed power law X-ray con-
tinuum that we derived for the CSOs in our sample is
consistent with either the nuclear (X-ray corona) emis-
sion absorbed on the torus scale ((cid:46) pc), or an extended
(X-ray jets/lobes) emission absorbed on the host galaxy
(∼ kpc) scale. We note that the results described in Sec-
tion 5.1.1, along with that of Ostorero et al. (2015), favor
the latter possibility. Instead, high intrinsic luminosities,
exceeding 1044 erg s−1, derived for several CSOs (Fig-
ure 5, bottom panel), together with the likely detection
of the reprocessed/scattered nuclear light in 2021+614
(Section 4.2) and 0710+439 (Section 4.1) may indicate
the dominant AGN contribution to the observed X-ray
emission of young radio sources.

Our results do not appear to favor thermal emission of
the diﬀuse ISM plasma as the origin of the CSO X-ray
continuum, unless the soft X-rays and the He-like iron
emission in 0710+439 are interpreted as a sole example in
which the ISM is heated by the expanding radio structure
(Section 4.1, Figure 4, Model E).

6. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We examined the X-ray properties of 16 young radio
sources with Chandra and observed variety of interesting
characteristics, which we summarize below.

• We found that our CSO sample covers a wide range
in X-ray luminosity, L2−10 keV ∼ 1041–1045 erg s−1
and that the majority of sources contains a modest
amount of the intrinsic absorption (NH (cid:39) 1021–
1022 cm−2).

• We obtained the highest quality X-ray spectrum of
the CSO source to date in our long Chandra ob-
servation of 0710+439 and found an ionized iron
emission line, Erest = (6.62 ± 0.04) keV, EW =
154+65−58 eV (in Model B). However, we were not able
to determine the origin of the line, as it could be
related to the emission from the hot ionized accre-
tion disk illuminated by an external source, from a
distant photoionized medium, or from a diﬀuse hot
thermal plasma within the nuclear region.
• We found a hard photon index of Γ = 0.8+0.3−0.2 in
2021+614 consistent with either a Compton thick
absorber or non-thermal emission from compact ra-
dio lobes.

• We discovered that the 2–10 keV X-ray ﬂux de-
creased by an order of magnitude since the 2008
XMM-Newton observation of 1607+26. Future
monitoring of this source is needed in order to char-
acterize and understand the nature of the variabil-
ity.

• We examined the highest angular resolution X-ray
images of the CSOs and detected extended X-ray
emission in 1718−649 which needs to be studied
with the deeper X-ray observations in the future.

We found that short ∼5 ksec X-ray observations with
Chandra have proven to be eﬀective in detecting the
CSOs sources and deriving their basic X-ray properties.
With our Chandra program, we observed six CSOs for
the ﬁrst time in X-rays, and we increased the size of the
known CSOs sample with measured redshift, kinematic
age, and X-ray information by ∼68%. The CSO X-ray
population can be further extended through snapshot
Chandra and/or XMM-Newton observations of seven
sources whose kinematic ages have been recently derived
(An & Baan 2012, Figure 1). However, it is apparent
that deeper exposures are needed in order to study de-
tails of the CSOs environment (e.g., the amount of in-
trinsic absorption, the gaseous media co-spatial with the
radio sources) and the origin of the CSOs intrinsic X-ray
emission (diﬀused thermal vs. nuclear emission, evidence
for reprocessing of the nuclear X-rays by a circumnu-
clear matter, thermal vs. non-thermal electron popula-
tion generating the high-energy CSOs spectra, long term
X-ray variability). Deep X-ray observations are also nec-
essary in order to place critical constraints on current
theoretical models for the earliest stage of radio source
evolution.
