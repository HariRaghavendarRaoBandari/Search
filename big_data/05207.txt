The metallic transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are benchmark systems for studying and
controlling intertwined electronic orders in solids, with superconductivity developing upon cooling
from a charge density wave state. The interplay between such phases is thought to play a critical role
in the unconventional superconductivity of cuprates, Fe-based, and heavy-fermion systems, yet even
for the more moderately-correlated TMDCs, their nature and origins have proved highly controver-
sial. Here, we study a prototypical example, 2H-NbSe2, by spin- and angle-resolved photoemission
and ﬁrst-principles theory. We ﬁnd that the normal state, from which its hallmark collective phases
emerge, is characterised by quasiparticles whose spin is locked to their valley pseudospin. This
results from a combination of strong spin-orbit interactions and local inversion symmetry breaking.
Non-negligible interlayer coupling further drives a rich three-dimensional momentum-dependence
of the underlying Fermi surface spin texture. Together, these ﬁndings necessitate a fundamental
re-investigation of the nature of charge order and superconducting pairing in NbSe2 and related
TMDCs.

In combination with broken structural inversion symme-
try, spin-orbit coupling (SOC) provides a powerful route
to stabilise spin-polarised electronic states without mag-
netism. This can give rise to electrically-tuneable spin
splittings via the Rashba eﬀect, promising new tech-
nological developments in spintronics,1 and underpins
the formation of spin-helical Dirac cones at the surfaces
of topological insulators.2 It is strongly desired to re-
alise similar eﬀects in systems where more pronounced
electronic interactions drive the emergence of collective
phases. In non-centrosymmetric superconductors, for ex-
ample, spin-splitting driven by strong SOC is expected
to induce a mixing of spin-triplet and singlet supercon-
ducting order parameters,3 and oﬀers potential for stabil-
ising topological superconductors.4 Yet, identifying suit-
able candidate materials has proved a major challenge to
date. Partly this is driven by a relative dearth of non-
centrosymmetric metals, while for non-magnetic systems
in which the centre of inversion is maintained, robust
spin-degeneracies of their electronic states would typi-
cally be expected due to the dual constraints of time-
reversal and inversion symmetry.

In contrast, we show here from spin- and angle-resolved
photoemission (ARPES) measurements that the normal
state of the centrosymmetric TMDC superconductor 2H-
NbSe2 (hereafter denoted NbSe2) hosts a strong layer-
resolved and momentum-dependent spin-polarisation of

its electronic states at and in the vicinity of the Fermi
level. We attribute this as a consequence of a recently-
realised form of spin polarisation that can emerge in
globally centrosymmetric materials in which constituent
structural units nonetheless break inversion symmetry.5–7
Together with ﬁrst-principles calculations, we show how
this drives a critical and complex interplay of inter-
layer interactions and spin-orbit coupling in NbSe2. This
yields a rich underlying spin-polarised electronic land-
scape from which charge order and superconductivity
emerge upon cooling.

Results
Bulk electronic properties of NbSe2. We consider
here exclusively the layered 2H polymorph (Fig. 1(a)).
Each layer forms a graphene-like honeycomb structure
with Nb occupying the “A” sublattice and two Se atoms
situated on the “B” sublattice. These lie out of the basel
plane, equidistant above and below the transition metal.
The unit cell contains two such layers, stacked along the
c-axis with 180◦ in-plane rotation. Our resistivity mea-
surements (Fig. 1(b)) from single-crystal NbSe2 samples
show a metallic temperature-dependence. They addi-
tionally exhibit a pronounced hump at a temperature of
TCDW ≈ 33 K indicative of charge-density wave (CDW)
formation,8 as well as a sharp superconducting transition
at Tc ≈ 7 K. The corresponding normal-state Fermi sur-

central diﬀuse pocket (most visible at hν = 106 eV) predominantly derived from Se pz orbitals.

face is shown in Fig. 1(c), as measured by ARPES. There
are two barrels centred around each zone-corner K (K(cid:48))
point which are strongly trigonally-warped. Two further
barrels are centred at the Γ point, the inner of which
is hexagonal while the outer exhibits additional warp-
ing. From our ﬁrst-principles density-functional theory
calculations, and consistent with previous studies,9–11
we assign all four of these Fermi surface sheets as be-
ing predominantly derived from Nb 4d orbitals. Addi-
tional spectral weight at the zone centre is evident in
our ARPES measurements for selected photon energies,
which we attribute as a ﬁfth, highly three-dimensional,
Fermi surface sheet of predominantly Se pz orbital char-
acter.

This sheet also contributes diﬀuse ﬁlled-in intensity,
due to the ﬁnite out-of-plane momentum (kz) resolution
of ARPES, close to the zone centre in measurements of
the electronic dispersions along in-plane high-symmetry
directions (Fig. 2(a)). The Nb-dominated states, on the
other hand, yield clear spectral features close to their
Fermi crossings. Kinks in their measured dispersion and
a decrease in linewidth near the Fermi level point to
relatively-strong electron-phonon coupling in this sys-
tem.11–13 It is these Nb-derived states that are known
to host the largest energy gaps at the Fermi level arising
from the CDW and superconducting instabilities in this
system,13–16 although the origins of these have proved
highly controversial.8,10,11,13–22 To the best of our knowl-
edge, all prior theoretical treatments assume these or-
ders emerge from an electronic liquid of trivially spin-
degenerate character. Indeed, standard expectations of
group theory would say this must be the case for the
centrosymmetric space group (P 63/mmc) of 2H-NbSe2.
In contrast, we directly observe pronounced spin po-

larisations of the underlying electronic states in spin-
resolved energy distribution curves (spin-EDCs,
see
Methods) measured along the Γ − K direction, shown
in Fig. 2(c-f). This is particularly apparent close to
the saddle point of these bands (Fig. 2(d)), where two
clearly-separated peaks can be observed in spin-EDCs.
The measured spin polarisation is almost entirely out-of-
plane (Fig. 2(d) and Supplemental Fig. S1), with a sign
that reverses between the two bands. We attribute this
as arising from local inversion symmetry breaking within
the individual layers that make up the bulk crystal struc-
ture.5,6,23 For suﬃciently weak interlayer interactions (a
point we return to below), pronounced spin-orbit cou-
pling characteristic of the 4d transition metal can lift the
spin-degeneracy of the states localised within each layer,
that thus strongly “feel” the local inversion asymmetry.
A layer-dependent sign change of this spin polarisation,
mediated by the rotated layer stacking of the bulk crys-
tal structure, would act to restore overall spin degen-
eracy as required by global inversion and time-reversal
symmetries. Nonetheless, the electronic states retain
strong layer-resolved spin polarisations. Depth-averaging
probes would largely be insensitive to these, but photoe-
mission is a surface sensitive technique. Incoherent su-
perposition of photoelectrons emitted from neighbouring
layers of the unit cell would lead to some suppression of
the measured spin polarisation, while interference eﬀects
can further complicate this picture5. Nonetheless, the
extreme surface sensitivity at the photon energies used
here, with an inelastic mean free path on the order of the
inter-layer separation, renders us predominantly sensitive
to the spin texture of the top-most layer of the unit cell.

layers of semiconducting TMDCs,24–26 where it has not
only been shown to lead to new physics, such as a val-
ley Hall eﬀect,27 but also to oﬀer potential for devices
exploiting the valley pseudospin.28,29 Our observations
here point to a pronounced role of spin-valley coupling
also for the low-energy quasiparticle excitations of the
metallic 2H-structured TMDCs.

Critically, it is from this spin-polarised Fermi sea that
electron-hole and electron-electron pairing interactions
drive the formation of CDW order and superconductiv-
ity. The largest CDW gaps in NbSe2 are located on
the zone-corner spin-valley locked Fermi surfaces.13 The
CDW wave vector is entirely in-plane,30 making such hid-
den layer-dependent spin polarisations relevant: we thus
conclude that these cannot be viewed as purely charge
density wave states with no role of the spin degree of
freedom. The underlying spin textures can also be ex-
pected to have important implications for superconduc-
tivity. Recent measurements on electrically-gated MoS2,
which is known to host a strong spin-valley locking in
its band structure,25,26 have found evidence for uncon-
ventional so-called Ising superconductivity.31,32 In this,
the pronounced spin-orbit ﬁeld that induces the under-
lying spin texture of the electronic states pins the spin
of Cooper pair electrons in the out-of-plane direction.
This leads to upper critical ﬁelds dramatically exceeding
the Pauli paramagnetic limit for a magnetic ﬁeld applied
within the ab-plane. Similar phenomenology has recently
been reported for mono- and few-layer NbSe2,33 entirely
consistent with our direct observation of spin-valley lock-
ing in this compound.

In bulk NbSe2, the spin-layer locking, and also multi-
band nature as compared to gated MoS2, raises further
prospects for stabilising a delicate balance between diﬀer-
ent pairing states. In the normal state, we ﬁnd that the
Γ-centred Fermi surface barrels, which are known to sup-
port a modulated superconducting gap in the bulk,13,34
are also strongly spin-polarised along the Γ− K direction

FIG. 3: Spin-valley locked Fermi surfaces. (a) Disper-
sion measured (hν = 22 eV) along the K − M − K

together with the corresponding spin-polarisation of an MDC
at the Fermi level and (b-d) EDCs at the momenta marked
in (a). These reveal how the sign of the spin polarisation for
each zone-corner Fermi surface sheet becomes locked to the
valley degree of freedom, as shown schematically in (e).

(cid:48)

such non-trivial spin textures in NbSe2 persist up to
the Fermi level. This is evident in spin-resolved EDCs
along the Γ − K direction (Fig. 2(c-f)) as well as the
spin polarisation of EDCs and a Fermi-level momen-
tum distribution curve (MDC) along the K − M − K(cid:48)
direction (Fig. 3). The latter clearly reveals how the
spin polarisation reverses sign for each pair of Fermi sur-
face sheets centred on neighbouring K and K(cid:48) points.
This is a natural consequence of time-reversal symme-
try. Here, this results in a coupling of the spin to the
so-called valley index, the quantum number which dis-
tinguishes K- and K(cid:48)-centred Fermi surfaces in NbSe2
(Fig. 3(e)). Such spin-valley coupling has recently been
extensively investigated for the band extrema in mono-

(Fig. 2(c)). Their spin polarisation, however, is com-
pletely suppressed along Γ− M (Fig. 2(b)). Intriguingly,
the largest superconducting gaps of this Fermi surface de-
termined in Ref.13 are located at the regions of strongest
spin polarisation evident here. Pronounced supercon-
ducting gaps are also known to occur on the zone-corner
Fermi surfaces,13,15,34 which, as demonstrated above,
host strong spin-valley locking even in the bulk. Given
the signiﬁcant inﬂuence of SOC, a mixing of spin-triplet
and spin-singlet order parameters could potentially be
expected.3 Forming even pseudospin-singlet Cooper pairs
from the strongly spin-polarised Fermi surfaces could ne-
cessitate a phase locking between the order parameter of
neighbouring Fermi surface sheets. Moreover, the c-axis
coherence length in NbSe2 is much greater than the inter-
layer separation.35,36 This raises the tantalising prospect
that the inherent coupling between the spin and layer
pseudospins reported here could be tuned to drive an in-
stability to an odd-parity pair density wave state, where
the sign of the superconducting gap becomes tied to the
layer index.7,37 The proximity of bulk NbSe2 and similar
compounds to such phases requires further theoretical
exploration, and will depend sensitively on the relative
importance of inter- and intra-band as well as interlayer
pairing interactions.

Three-dimensional spin structure. Our density-
functional theory calculations (Fig. 4) already reveal a
key role of interlayer interactions in mediating and con-
trolling the underlying spin texture of the normal-state

bulk Fermi surface. The calculated spin-polarisation
projected onto the ﬁrst layer of the unit cell is shown
throughout the full three-dimensional Brillouin zone in
Fig. 4(a,b). The momentum-dependent spin polarisa-
tions are determined by the eﬀective spin-orbit ﬁeld,
Bso = β(∇V × k), where β is a momentum-dependent
scaling factor, ∇V is the net electrostatic potential gra-
dient, and k is the crystal momentum. The horizontal
mirror symmetry of each NbSe2 structural unit about
the transition-metal plane (σh of the D3h point group;
Fig. 1(a)) ensures that ∇V is entirely within the xy plane.
Due to the 180◦ relative rotation of neighbouring NbSe2
monolayers in the bulk crystal structure, ∇V , and thus
Bso, has opposite sign for successive layers in the unit
cell. This causes the sign of the spin polarisation to
reverse at each momentum-space point when projected
onto layer 2 vs. layer 1 of the unit cell (Supplemental
Fig. S3). This conﬁrms that local inversion asymmetry
within each NbSe2 layer drives the formation of the spin-
polarised states observed here.

For electronic states whose wavefunctions are com-
pletely delocalised over both layers of the unit cell, the
spin-orbit ﬁeld from each layer cancels. Such states are
consequently unpolarised, restoring the conventional ex-
pectations for a centrosymmetric space group. This can
be observed for the highly three-dimensional “pancake”
Fermi surface at the Brillouin zone centre here. In con-
trast, for electronic states predominantly localised within
individual layers of the unit cell, strong layer-dependent
spin-orbit ﬁelds mediate large layer-resolved spin polari-

Brillouin zone boundary along kz (kz = π/c). In a tight-
binding picture, for this kz, interlayer hoppings within
a unit cell and between neighbouring unit cells are out
of phase with each other and thus cancel.10 This can
be directly visualised by comparing the dispersion of the
electronic states along the Γ-M -K-Γ and A-L-H-A direc-
tions: neglecting SOC, a single four-fold degenerate band
crosses the Fermi level in the kz = π/c plane (Fig. 4(c)),
whereas this is split into a pair of two-fold degenerate
bands by interlayer interactions for |kz| < π/c, as evi-
dent in Fig. 4(d).

With its forbidden interlayer coupling, the electronic
structure for the kz = π/c plane is thus formally equiva-
lent to that of an isolated monolayer. The spin-orbit ﬁeld
is consequently maximised, driving the largest (> 90%)
layer-dependent spin-polarisations. These are purely out-
of-plane (Fig. 4(a,b)), as (∇V ×k) must lie entirely along
z at the Brillouin zone boundary along kz. Along the
A-L direction, however, a vertical mirror plane in the
crystal structure forbids any out-of-plane component of
(∇V × k). The spin-orbit ﬁeld must therefore be strictly
zero along A-L. This enforces a touching, and hence
spin-degeneracy, of the zone-centre Fermi surface barrels
along this direction, which are otherwise strongly spin-
polarised throughout the kz = π/c plane.

For other kz through the Brillouin zone, the spin-orbit
ﬁeld strength can be partially suppressed by ﬁnite in-
terlayer coupling. Moreover, the z-component of the mo-
mentum induces a non-zero component of (∇V ×k) in the
xy plane. Together, this causes not only the magnitude of
the Fermi surface spin polarisation, but also its vectorial
spin texture, to develop a strong dependence on both the
in- and out-of-plane momentum (Fig. 4(a,b)). Within the
Γ-M -L-A plane, the calculated Fermi surface crossings
are relatively strongly dispersive in kz (Fig. 4(e)). This
is consistent with our experimental measurements of the
kz-dependent Fermi surface (Fig. 4(f)) and points to sig-
niﬁcant interlayer coupling. Even away from kz = π/c,
the Fermi surface spin polarisations therefore become
strongly suppressed in the entire vicinity of the Γ-M -L-A
plane.

For the Γ-K-H-A plane, however, we ﬁnd that the kz
dispersion of the Fermi surface crossings are signiﬁcantly
reduced by the inclusion of spin-orbit coupling in the cal-
culations (Fig. 4(e)), in keeping with our experimental
measurements of more two-dimensional Fermi contours
for this plane (Fig. 4(f)). This reduction in kz dispersion
is achieved by a lifting, via SOC, of the four-fold de-
generacy that would otherwise be present along the A-H
line, and is accompanied by the emergence of strong spin-
polarisation of the Fermi surface crossings for kz = π/c.
This is in contrast to the A-L line, where the energetic
degeneracy of the Fermi crossings is protected by their
symmetry-enforced spin degeneracy. The reduction of
kz-dispersion within the Γ-K-H-A plane is equivalent to

5

a spin-orbit-mediated suppression of interlayer hopping
here.28 This allows relatively strong spin polarisations to
be maintained in the vicinity of this plane, with only
a moderate suppression of the spin-orbit ﬁeld strength
away from kz = π/c.

For momenta close to the K-H line, the in-plane mo-
mentum is always much larger than the out-of-plane
component. This causes (∇V × k) to remain predom-
inately aligned along z. The spin polarisations of the
zone-corner Fermi surfaces are thus largely out-of-plane
throughout the full Brillouin zone (Fig. 4(a)). For the
Nb-derived zone-centre Fermi surface barrels, however,
much stronger (up to ∼ 25%) in-plane components de-
velop (Fig. 4(b)). The in-plane spin texture is largely
radial to the Fermi surface (Supplemental Fig. S4), and
switches sign about the kz = 0 plane. This indicates a
non-zero component of (∇V × k) within the plane, with
a direction that is tied to the sign of kz. It thus conﬁrms
that an in-plane component of the spin texture arises
due to ﬁnite out-of-plane momentum, where no symme-
try constraint exists to cancel the in-plane component
of the spin-orbit ﬁeld for low-symmetry momenta with
0 < |kz| < π/c. The existence of such hidden in-plane
spin textures is a unique property of the bulk compound.
Indeed, the in-plane spin component goes strictly to zero
at the Brillouin zone boundary along kz, enforced by
symmetry, and recovering a monolayer-like purely out-
of-plane spin texture for kz = ±π/c. The bulk system
thus hosts a rich intertwining of spin, orbital, and layer
degrees of freedom, mediating a three-dimensional na-
ture of its spin texture that can be expected to further
modulate its pairing interactions.31

Discussion
Taken together, our results show how the combination
of interlayer hopping and intra-layer inversion symme-
try breaking can lead to particularly rich momentum-
dependent spin textures of metallic TMDCs. Suppres-
sion of Fermi surface spin polarisation away from the
Brillouin zone boundary along kz will be reduced with
decreased interlayer interactions.
Indeed, upper criti-
cal ﬁelds, already known to exceed the Pauli limit for
bulk NbSe2,38 are dramatically enhanced in other 2H-
TMDC superconductors as a function of increasing in-
terlayer separation.39 This points to a susceptibility of
the bulk systems to Ising superconductivity similar to
that recently observed in isolated monolayers.33 The del-
icate balance between interlayer hopping and spin-orbit
coupling strength in NbSe2 makes this an ideal material
for understanding and ultimately controlling the role of
layer-dependent spin polarisations on the collective states
and phases of transition-metal dichalcogenides.

Methods
ARPES: Spin-resolved ARPES measurements were per-
formed at the I3 beamline of MAX-IV Laboratory, Sweden,

and ARPES measurements were performed using the I05
beamline of Diamond Light Source, UK. Measurements were
performed at temperatures of 50−80 K using p-polarised syn-
chrotron light. Scienta R4000 hemispherical electron analy-
sers were utilised for all measurements. This was additionally
ﬁtted with a mini-Mott detector scheme for the spin-ARPES
measurements, conﬁgured to simultaneously probe the out-of-
plane and in-plane (along the analyser slit direction) compo-
nent of the photoelectron spin.40 The ﬁnite spin-detection eﬃ-
ciency was corrected using a Sherman function of S = 0.17,40

results were downfolded using maximally localised Wannier

as basis functions. The resulting tight-binding Hamiltonian
allows a direct extraction of the spin and layer projections of
the electronic structure.
