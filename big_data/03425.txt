Abstract

We investigate the linear response of an O (N ) scalar quantum ﬁeld theory subject to external
perturbations using the symmetry improved two particle irreducible eﬀective action (SI-2PIEA) for-
malism [A. Pilaftsis and D. Teresi, Nucl. Phys. B874, 594 (2013)]. Despite satisfactory equilibrium
behavior, we ﬁnd a number of unphysical eﬀects at the linear response level. Goldstone boson ﬁeld
ﬂuctuations are over-determined, with the only consistent solution being to set the ﬂuctuations and
their driving sources to zero, except for momentum modes where the Higgs and Goldstone self-
energies obey a particular relationship. Also Higgs ﬁeld ﬂuctuations propagate masslessly, despite
the Higgs propagator having the correct mass. These pathologies are independent of any truncation
of the eﬀective action and still exist even if we relax the over-determining Ward identities, so long
as the constraint is formulated O (N )-covariantly. We discuss possible reasons for the apparent
incompatibility of the constraints and linear response approximation and possible ways forward.

Quantum ﬁeld theory is the mathematical language of nature. Viewed in this light, much
of the last century of theoretical physics can be seen as quantum ﬁeld theory calculations
performed in a variety of approximations. The most fruitful scheme so far is clearly pertur-
bation theory in small couplings, which has seen wide use and great success. Nevertheless
there are important physical situations where naive perturbation theory fails and must be
enhanced by partial resummation if it can be used at all. For example, massless particles in
thermal plasmas produce large loop corrections which must be resummed, causing thermal
mass generation and non-analyticities in thermodynamic functions. Similarly, large loga-
rithms can invalidate naive perturbation theory in problems involving disparate length or
energy scales. Resummation of these logarithms leads to the renormalization group running
of coupling constants. Although the need to go beyond naive perturbation theory is clear in
many cases, ad hoc resummations are problematic because perturbation series are asymp-
totic in nature [1]. Systematic resummation schemes are required to guarantee consistency
with the original non-perturbative theory. There are three such schemes which can claim to
be widely studied and successful: the renormalization group (RG) [2], large N expansion [3],
and n-particle irreducible eﬀective actions (nPIEAs) [4]. This work focuses on the latter.

nPIEAs are a functional technique that combine the advantages (and some disadvan-
tages) of perturbation theory and variational methods. Based on a Legendre transform
procedure, nPIEAs are guaranteed to be equivalent to the original theory and can capture
analytic features of the exact theory that are invisible to perturbation theory, and so side-
step potential issues with ad hoc resummations [5]. The 1PIEA, developed by Goldstone,
Salam and Weinberg [6] and Jona-Lasinio [7], eﬀects a resummation of tadpoles by deﬁning
an eﬀective action functional Γ [ϕ] which depends on the expectation value ϕ = hφi of the
quantum ﬁeld. The physical value of ϕ is determined by the variational equation of mo-
tion δΓ/δϕ = 0 and, when this equation is satisﬁed, one can drop all one particle reducible
diagrams from the diagrammatic perturbation expansion.

The 2PIEA technique was originally developed by Lee and Yang [8], Luttinger and Ward
[9], Baym [10] and others in the context of many-body theory, then extended by Cornwall,

2

Jackiw and Tomboulis [11] to relativistic ﬁeld theory in the functional formalism. In the
2PIEA formalism one deﬁnes an action functional Γ [ϕ, ∆] depending not just on the mean
ﬁeld, but also its correlation function ∆ ∼ hφφi − ϕϕ, and solves for ∆ using δΓ/δ∆ = 0.
This eﬀects a resummation of all self-energy insertions and removes two particle reducible
diagrams from the diagrammatic expansion.

Apparently de Dominicis and Martin [12] were the ﬁrst to realize that the n = 1 and
n = 2 formalisms are special cases of a general construction giving higher order eﬀective
actions for n ≥ 3. However, work on higher eﬀective actions languished despite an early
book on the topic by Vasiliev [13] which was unfortunately not available in English for more
than twenty years. The recent resurgence of interest in higher nPIEAs has largely been
driven by their advantages for non-equilibrium problems and can likely be credited to the
reviews by Berges [4, 14] and advances in computer power.

One of the disadvantages of nPIEAs is that ﬁnite order truncations of the eﬀective actions
generically do not respect the symmetry properties one expects from the exact theory. This
is because the correlation functions of the 1PIEA obey diﬀerent Ward identities (WIs) than
the 2PIEA etc. This can also be understood in terms of the patterns of resummations
eﬀected by nPIEAs which, if truncated, do not preserve the order by order cancellations
required to maintain all symmetries. Similar remarks apply for global symmetries and gauge
invariances. The most notable physical consequence of this is a violation of Goldstone’s
theorem for theories with spontaneous symmetry breaking: would-be Goldstone bosons gain
an unphysical mass in the Hartree-Fock approximation, leading also to unphysical reaction
thresholds and decay rates. More subtle eﬀects appear in higher order approximations.
Similarly, in gauge theories a residual gauge dependence appears in quantities that should
be physical. This work focuses on the particular scheme devised by Pilaftsis and Teresi [15]
for improving the symmetry properties of 2PIEAs. Symmetry improvement enforces 1PI
style WIs on the 2PIEA by the use of Lagrange multipliers. The resulting constraint forces
the Goldstone boson correlation functions to obey Goldstone’s theorem, giving physically
correct massless Goldstone bosons at all orders and even at ﬁnite temperatures below the
critical temperature of the symmetry breaking phase transition.

So far symmetry improvement has only been applied to non-gauged scalar ﬁeld theories in
equilibrium. It restores Goldstone’s theorem and produces physically reasonable absorptive
parts in propagators [15] and has been shown to restore the second order phase transition
of the O (4) linear sigma model [16].
It has been used to study pion strings evolving in
the thermal bath of a heavy ion collision [17] (though note that the symmetry improved
2PIEA was only used to calculate an equilibrium ﬁnite temperature eﬀective potential;
this work did not constitute what we would call a true non-equilibrium calculation using
symmetry improved eﬀective actions). Symmetry improvement has also been demonstrated
to improve the evaluation of the eﬀective potential of the standard model by taming the
infrared divergences of the Higgs sector, treated as an O (4) scalar ﬁeld theory with gauge
interactions turned oﬀ [18, 19]. The symmetry improvement idea can also be extended to
3PIEAs [20], which requires enforcing an additional set of WIs for the three point vertex
function and the ﬁxing of an ambiguity in the constraint procedure.

There is a strong motivation to extend symmetry improvement beyond equilibrium since
one of the major reasons for using nPIEAs in the ﬁrst place is their ability to handle
non-equilibrium situations. nPIEAs give an entirely mechanical way to set up the generic
initial value problem as a closed system of integro-diﬀerential equations directly for the
mean ﬁelds and low order correlation functions, which are simply related to the handful

3

of physical quantities (densities, conserved currents, etc.) one is most often interested in.
Apart from a truncation to some ﬁnite loop order these equations need not be subject to
any further approximation. Hence, apart from the symmetry issue and issues involved in the
renormalization process, nPIEAs give potentially the most general and accurate framework
available for the computation of real time properties in quantum ﬁeld theory. Motivated by
this, we seek to extend the symmetry improvement technique to non-equilibrium situations.
The ultimate goal of this program would be a tractable and manifestly gauge invariant set of
equations of motion for highly excited Yang-Mills-Higgs theories with chiral fermion matter
based on the self-consistently complete 4PIEA. In the meantime we content ourselves with
an analysis of the symmetry improved 2PIEA for scalar ﬁelds in the linear response regime.

We investigate the linear response approximation rather than a generic non-equilibrium
situation for several reasons. First, the linear response approximation is simply far more
tractable than the general non-equilibrium situation as the response functions only depend
on the equilibrium properties of the theory. Second, linear response is widely applicable
in the real world: many systems are “close enough” to equilibrium for practical purposes.
Third, the linear response approximation is a nice laboratory to isolate the novel features
of symmetry improvement constraints in non-equilibrium settings.
Indeed, we can ﬁnd
results that are independent of any truncation of the eﬀective action. Finally, we expect
any physically reasonable formalism to give a well formed linear response approximation,
though note this depends on the assumption that the exact behavior is an analytic (or at least
not too singular) function of the external perturbation within some neighborhood of zero
perturbation. This is true of all quantum mechanical systems (so long as the Hamiltonian
remains bounded below), but for ﬁeld theories the inﬁnite number of degrees of freedom
may complicate the situation.

The outline of the remainder of this work is as follows. In Section II we review linear
response theory and 2PIEAs. Then in Section III we review the symmetry improvement
method, re-deriving the WI constraints in the presence of external sources which were ne-
glected in previous work. In Section IV we derive the consequences of the constraints for
the linear response functions, noting that a careful treatment of the constraint procedure
requires that not just the WI, but also its derivatives, must vanish. In Section V we reach
our conclusions about the feasibility of symmetry improvement within the linear response
approximation and sketch some ideas for future work. In Appendix A we discuss an alterna-
tive symmetry improvement procedure that relaxes the over-determining WIs, but still leads
to diﬃculties due to the necessity of the derivatives of the constraint to also vanish. Finally,
Appendix B includes a mechanical analogy which illustrates some of the subtle points about
the constraint procedure in a simpler setting.

Our conventions follow our previous paper [20].

In particular  = c = 1 and ηµν =
diag (1,−1,−1,−1). Loop counting factors of  will be kept. Repeated indices are summed,
and spacetime arguments going along with O (N) indices are implicitly integrated over (“De-
Witt notation”). Where explicitly written spacetime integrals are ´x ≡ ´ d4x and momentum
integrals are ´p = ´ d4p/ (2π)4. (cid:16) ˜T(cid:17) T [· · · ] represents the (anti-)time ordered product of
the factors in [· · · ]. It is not necessary here to distinguish between real time, Matsubara
and Schwinger-Keldysh time contours. For a physical quantity X we denote its equilibrium
value by ˜X and its shift under linear response by δX so that X = ˜X + δX plus higher order
terms.

II. LINEAR RESPONSE THEORY AND EFFECTIVE ACTIONS

Linear response theory studies the eﬀect of small externally applied perturbations on a
system initially in equilibrium. Consider a quantum system which is subjected to an external
driving potential −J (t) ˆB (t) where J (t) is a c-number function of time representing the
strength of the driving and ˆB (t) is the interaction Hamiltonian (the reason for the name
will become apparent). If the initial state of the system is described by a density matrix ρ0
at time t0, with J (t) = 0 for t ≤ t0, then at time t > t0 the expectation of an operator ˆA
(in the interaction picture with respect to the external perturbation) is:

D ˆA (t)E = Trnρ (t) ˆA (t)o

t0

= TrnU (t, t0) ρ0U (t, t0)† ˆA (t)o
J(τ ) ˆB(τ )dτi ρ0 ˜The−i´ t

t0

where D ˜ˆA (t)E denotes the expected value in the absence of perturbation. This leads us to
deﬁne the response function χAB (t − τ ) = iDh ˆA (t) , ˆB (τ )iE Θ (t − τ ) (which only depends

on the time diﬀerence due to the equilibrium assumption about ρ0) such that

χAB (t − τ ) J (τ ) dτ + O(cid:0)J 2(cid:1) .

(The limits can be pushed to ±∞ thanks to the step function in χAB, and the equation
becomes trivial in the Fourier domain.) The goal of linear response theory is to compute
χAB (t − τ ) for perturbations ˆB and observables ˆA of interest. The condition for validity of
the approximation is that the quadratic term, which is

where a = 1,· · · , N and we choose to operate in the spontaneous symmetry breaking regime
with m2 < 0. The vacuum expectation value v is given by v2 = −6m2/λ and the tree level
mass of the radial (“Higgs”) mode is m2
H = λv2/3. We take the vacuum expectation value
to be in the last component ϕa ≡ hφai = (0,· · · , 0, v). The symmetry transformation is
δφa = iǫAT A
ab with A = 1,· · · , N (N − 1) /2 are the generators of rotations.
When we have cause to use speciﬁc generators we will write A = (j, k) with j 6= k in
1,· · · , N to denote the plane of rotation, and have T jk

Considering this theory in a particle physics context, the most likely external perturba-
tions will be linear or quadratic in the ﬁelds. For example, we could be using this theory to
describe mesons coupling to hadrons through Yukawa interactions ∼ φ ¯ψψ, or Higgs ﬁelds
coupling to a Yang-Mills sector through (possibly some subset of) the conserved currents
ab←→∂µ φb(cid:17) and W µAWµAφaφa. The theory can also represent an
with terms like W µA(cid:16)iφaT A
extended Higgs or dark matter sector coupled via portal terms to the standard model Higgs
with ∼ φaφaΦ†Φ, or coupled to a standard model singlet scalar sector S through ∼ Sφφ.
Finally the ﬁelds could represent a multi-ﬁeld inﬂaton, moduli or an extended gravitational
sector, all of whose interactions to the standard model sector will be mediated by terms
of the preceding forms to leading order in an eﬀective ﬁeld theory expansion. Thus, on
very general grounds we expect that the external perturbation can be taken as a linear or
quadratic function of the ﬁelds. The only notable exception is the coupling of the ﬁeld

theory to gravity, which includes the quartic interaction ∼ √−g (φaφa)2.

We now consider the notable observables in the theory. Chieﬂy we will be interested in

the ﬁeld expectation values ϕa, the conserved O (N) currents

and the energy-momentum tensor

Again we see that, apart from the (φaφa)2 term in the energy, the observables are also linear

or quadratic in the ﬁelds. Note that if desired (cid:10)(φaφa)2(cid:11) can be approximated in a mean
ﬁeld approximation by terms of the form hφφi2, hφφihφi2 and hφi4 plus corrections that can
be found diagrammatically. This means that many of the local quantities one might want
can be determined by a method yielding ϕa and i∆ab ≡ hT [φaφb]i−ϕaϕb subject to generic

the 2PIEA.

The 2PIEA is deﬁned as the double Legendre transform of the connected generating

Symmetry improvement replaces the vev equation of motion by the constraint vm2

so that Goldstone’s theorem is exactly satisﬁed whenever v 6= 0. The value of v is then
determined by the self-consistent solution of (16).
To connect this formalism to linear response theory we must expand ϕ → ˜ϕ + δϕ and
∆ → ˜∆ + δ∆ about their source-free equilibrium values ˜ϕ and ˜∆ in (12)-(13) and match
terms order by order in the sources, treating the responses δϕ and δ∆ as ﬁrst order, as

This is an equation which determines the four point kernel χ∆K iteratively, i.e. a Bethe-

While this is the general formalism connecting eﬀective actions to linear response theory,
we do not need to use it because symmetry improvement constraints change the picture sig-
niﬁcantly. In particular, we can derive the implications of the constraints for linear response
theory without explicitly computing any equilibrium solutions, taking any derivatives of the
eﬀective action, performing any truncation of the self-energies, or worrying about renormal-
ization of the Bethe-Salpeter equation. Our results are independent of all of these details.

III. SYMMETRY IMPROVEMENT

Here we review the symmetry improvement procedure since the derivation of the con-
straint and the limiting procedure are aﬀected by the presence of sources. The idea is to
force the 2PI propagator ∆−1 to mimic the behavior of the corresponding 1PI function
δ2Γ [ϕ] /δϕδϕ under a symmetry transformation. To derive the required WI we perform a
symmetry transformation of the 1PIEA

0 = δΓ =

(34)

(Note that our “DeWitt” integration convention can be maintained if we deﬁne the generators
to be spacetime delta functions: T A
ab (x, y) ∝ δ (x − y).) This is the “master” WI governing
all 1PI correlation functions of the theory. To ﬁnd the identity governing the propagator we
take a ﬁeld derivative then apply the equations of motion, giving

which holds for all rotations ǫA so we deﬁne

(35)

(36)

The symmetry improvement program then interprets the ∆−1 as the 2PI propagator. One
could also motivate the replacement Ja → Ja + Kabϕb based on the form of the right hand
side of (12). We do not make this replacement. The only aﬀect at the linear response level
would be to renormalize Ja → Ja + KaN v in our results below which, since Ja are freely
chosen functions, gives no new physics.

no diﬀerence in equilibrium. However, this constraint gives a diﬀerent scheme beyond the
equilibrium approximation. (Note that Pilaftsis and Teresi [15] did not write the constraint
in an O (N) covariant form, hence both of the above are valid generalizations of their proce-
dure.) Using C′ instead of C merely seems to shuﬄe around the pathologies we derive below
rather than remove them. We shall henceforth use C since dropping the projector greatly
simpliﬁes the following algebra. See Appendix A for discussion of the scheme using C′.

Thus the propagator equations of motion are unmodiﬁed and the vev equation is modiﬁed
by the presence of a homogeneous force that acts to push v away from the minimum of the
eﬀective potential to the point where m2

G = 0.

IMPLICATIONS OF CONSTRAINTS FOR LINEAR RESPONSE

In the linear response approximation Ja and Kab no longer vanish, and we must solve
equations (36), (40) and (42) to ﬁrst order in the sources without any assumption of homo-
geneity. To do this we expand all quantities ϕ → ˜ϕ + δϕ, ∆ → ˜∆ + δ∆ and ℓ → ˜ℓ + δℓ and
match terms order by order, considering the δϕ etc. as ﬁrst order. Working ﬁrst on (36)
gives the pair of equations:

0 = ˜∆−1
0 = δ∆−1

ca T A
ca T A

ab ˜ϕb,
ab ˜ϕb + ˜∆−1

ca T A

abδϕb − JaT A
ac.

(48)

(49)

The ﬁrst equation is simply the equilibrium constraint as expected since the analysis of the
last section holds with all quantities decorated with tildes. The second equation is new.
Using the identity (32) gives to ﬁrst order

0 = − ˜∆−1

cd δ∆de(cid:16) ˜∆−1

ea T A

ab ˜ϕb(cid:17) + ˜∆−1

ca T A

abδϕb − JaT A
ac.

The ﬁrst term vanishes by virtue of (48), thus

˜∆−1

ca T A

abδϕb = JaT A
ac.

(50)

(51)

The nature of this equation is remarkable. The constraint yields a wave equation for the
ﬂuctuations. Working out the component equations gives:

˜∆−1
G δϕN = −JN ,
˜∆−1
H δϕg = −Jg,
˜∆−1
G δϕg = −Jg,

A = (g, N) , c 6= N,
A = (g, N) , c = N,
A = (g, g′) , g, g′ 6= N.

(52)

(53)

(54)

The desired linear response functions are then just the Green functions for these equations,
i.e. χφJ

N N (x, y) = − ˜∆G (x, y) etc.

There are two major ﬂaws with these equations. The ﬁrst is a physical misprediction:
δϕN propagates masslessly due to the equilibrium Goldstone propagator even though the
Higgs propagator has a non-zero mass. The second is that δϕg is overdetermined, i.e.
its
initial value problem is ill posed. In the Fourier domain equations (53) and (54) read

(cid:16)p2 − m2

H − ˜ΣH (p)(cid:17) δϕg = −Jg,
(cid:16)p2 − ˜ΣG (p)(cid:17) δϕg = −Jg,

11

(55)

(56)

H + ˜ΣH (p) = ˜ΣG (p)
which obviously only allows solutions if there are modes satisfying m2
and if Jg is only supported on these modes. If any other perturbation is applied or a solution
H + ˜ΣH (p) = ˜ΣG (p) does not exist the system is inconsistent. This is clearly not the
of m2
expected behavior physically. One can relax (53) by using the projected constraint (38)
instead of (37), however this leads to further diﬃculties as discussed in Appendix A.

There is further danger lurking in the right hand sides of equations (40) and (42). Since
the constraint procedure involves a limit ˜ℓ → ∞ there is a danger that terms on the right
hand sides can diverge. Consider the expansion of the right hand side of (40) to ﬁrst order:

constraints automatically vanish is a consequence of using the unprojected constraint (37).
Had we used (38) instead, the troublesome equation of motion (53) would be gone, but the
secondary constraints become non-trivial and lead again to pathologies (see Appendix A).

V. DISCUSSION

We have shown that the imposition of symmetry improvement constraints is incompatible
with the linear response approximation. Since the original symmetry improvement scheme
of Pilaftsis and Teresi was not formulated O (N)-covariantly there are actually two natural

12

generalizations: a scheme we have used previously [20] based on (38) and a new one based
on the simpler constraint (37). Both schemes are equivalent in equilibrium and both lead,
in diﬀerent ways, to pathologies in the linear response approximation.

There are two types of pathology appearing in our results. The ﬁrst is that the Higgs ﬁeld
ﬂuctuations propagate masslessly. There is no simple modiﬁcation of the constraint which
could possibly ﬁx this problem since we can understand it as a consequence of treating ϕ
and ∆ as independent variables in the 2PIEA. For consider the ﬁrst order Ward identity for
the 1PIEA, which is the same in form as (49),

0 = δ∆−1

ca T A

ab ˜ϕb + ˜∆−1

only now ∆ is not independent and δ∆−1 is to be understood as arising purely from the
variation δϕ. To lowest order in :

which is consistent if m2
G + λv2/3 + O () which, of course, is true. Thus, for the
1PIEA the WI propagates Higgs and Goldstone ﬂuctuations with the correct masses and
source terms. This is expected because the WI was constructed to be satisﬁed by the 1PI
correlation functions. There is no longer any reason for this to work if δ∆ is independent of
δϕ.

One could try to remedy this deﬁciency by constraining the variation δ∆ to be related
to δϕ in a appropriate way. This would no longer be working strictly within the 2PIEA
formalism. Rather, it would deﬁne a hybrid 2PI-1PI scheme where one computes the equi-
librium properties using the symmetry improved 2PIEA, then deﬁnes a resummed 1PIEA
by eliminating ∆ from Γ in an appropriate way. This is similar to the usual resummed
1PIEA method, only now symmetry improvement is applied self-consistently at the 2PI
level. Expanding on this idea will be the subject of future work.

A more serious defect is that Goldstone ﬂuctuations are over-determined. This happens
in two ways, depending on which scheme is used. In the unprojected scheme used above,
the extra Goldstone equation comes directly from the WI. This can again be understood

13

as a consequence of treating δ∆ and δϕ as independent variables since the 1PI treatment
above does give a consistent set of equations. Thus a resummed 1PI scheme as described
above could possibly work using the unprojected constraint.

In the projected constraint scheme, the dangerous equation of motion is removed from
the primary constraints of the theory. However, secondary constraints appear and again δϕg
is over-determined. This can be understood as a consequence of the singular nature of the
constraint procedure. This is a result of the pure bad luck that derivatives of the WI vanish
automatically when the WI vanishes. This strongly motivates (a) the search for a way to
formulate the WI which is lower order in ϕ and ∆ (which hardly seems possible) and (b) an
investigation of symmetry improvement in theories other than vector-like O (N) theory.

It is interesting that the same number of non-trivial constraints is found in both schemes,
despite the attempt to reduce their number in the projected scheme. This is because the
projection operator depends on the ﬁelds ϕ, so has non-trivial derivatives. This will be the
case for any O (N)-covariant projection scheme. This motivates a study of whether it is
possible to non-covariantly project out the troublesome constraints, i.e. explicitly break the
symmetry in order to save it.

Finally we mention the logical possibility that the true behavior of the solutions to the
truncated SI-2PIEA equations of motion is non-analytic as a function of the sources in the
neighborhood of equilibrium. This would invalidate any attempted Taylor series expansion
in the sources and so we should expect problems at the linear response level. We do not
know at this time how to further analyze this possibility. It would also be interesting to
examine whether alternatives to symmetry improvement, such as the method for enforcing
constraints using external sources [22], can be extended to non-equilibrium situations.

Appendix A: The Alternate Constraint Scheme

Here we consider using the constraint (38) instead of (37) for the symmetry improvement.
The projection operator in (38) forces only Goldstone modes to be involved in the constraint.
Note that the constraints which have been projected out are valid WIs which are obeyed by
the 1PIEA. This alternate scheme consists of picking a subset of the WIs to enforce, chosen
in the only O (N)-covariant way available. The new constraint is

At lowest order this becomes

(A2)
which is the same as before. However, at ﬁrst order there are new terms due to the variation
of P ⊥. For reference we give the ﬁrst and second derivatives of P ⊥ evaluated at ˜ϕ:

Appendix B: Mechanical Analogy

Here we investigate a very simple mechanical system which illustrates several of the
unusual features of the constraint procedure and linear response formulation we have used.
It shows: (a) why the Lagrange multiplier diverges, (b) why constraints must be imposed
in the linear response approximation to begin with, (c) why secondary constraints arise.

Consider a unit mass classical particle constrained to move without friction on a circular
hoop of radius r in the x − y plane. Its Lagrangian is

˙x2 +

1
2

˙y2 − λW + jxx + jyy,

1

1

L =

W =

4(cid:0)x2 + y2 − r2(cid:1)2 ,

where λ is the Lagrange multiplier and the form of the constraint W = 0 is chosen to mimic
the singular constraint procedure. The equations of motion are

(B1)

(B2)

(B3)

(B4)

¨x = −λ∂xW + jx
= −λ(cid:0)x2 + y2 − r2(cid:1) x + jx,
¨y = −λ∂yW + jy
= −λ(cid:0)x2 + y2 − r2(cid:1) y + jy.

We now consider the source free case jx = jy = 0. The constraint terms vanish unless
λ → ∞ as x2 + y2 − r2 → 0. We set x2 + y2 − r2 = η and λη = ω2 and take the limit such
that ω2 is a constant. Note that W = η2/4. Then the equations of motion become

with the solutions

¨x = −ω2x,
¨y = −ω2y,

x = r cos [ω (t − t0)] ,
y = r sin [ω (t − t0)] ,

(B5)

(B6)

(B7)
(B8)

where t0 and ω are determined by the initial conditions. We take as the static solution x = r
and y = 0, which determines ω = 0 and t0 = 0.

Now we turn on the sources jx and jy and investigate the linear response by setting
x → ˜x + δx, y → ˜y + δy, λ → ˜λ + δλ where the tilde variables are the source free solutions.
The variation of the constraint is

δW = η (˜xδx + ˜yδy) → 0,

(B9)

regardless of the behavior of δx and δy, so long as they are non-singular in the η → 0 limit.
However, the ﬁrst order equations of motion become

δ¨x = −δλη˜x − ˜λ2 (˜xδx + ˜yδy) ˜x − ˜ληδx + jx

= F rad

x − ω2δx + jx = −ω2δx + j⊥
x ,

δ¨y = −δλη˜y − ˜λ2 (˜xδx + ˜yδy) ˜y − ˜ληδy + jy

= F rad

y − ω2δy + jy = −ω2δy + j⊥
y ,

(B10)

(B11)

where we introduce the radial force Frad = −hδλη + ˜λ2 (˜xδx + ˜yδy)i (˜x, ˜y), whose physical

function is to balance the applied force normal to the constraint surface, resulting in the net
transverse source j⊥.

19

Now notice the terms proportional to ˜λ (˜xδx + ˜yδy) in the equations of motion. In order
for these terms to be well behaved in the limit ˜λ → ∞ we must have ˜xδx + ˜yδy → 0, i.e.
the response remains within the constraint surface (to ﬁrst order). Thus the vanishing of
these terms in addition to the vanishing of δW is required to fully enforce that the response
be tangential to the constraint surface. We also note that by examining the δλ terms in the
equation of motion one can identify which component of the applied force acts normal to
the constraint surface (and hence produce no physical response).

Applying the static solution we ﬁnd Frad = −hδλη + ˜λ2rδxi (r, 0). For this to be well
behaved as ˜λ → ∞ requires δx = 0, which also determines j⊥
motion. The δy equation of motion is

x = 0 via the δx equation of

with the solution (taking into account the initial conditions δy0 = δ ˙y0 = 0):

δ¨y = jy,

δy = ˆ t

0 ˆ τ

jy (τ ′) dτ ′dτ = ˆ t

(t − τ ) jy (τ ) dτ.

(B12)

(B13)

Now we can compare this to the exact solution. Substituting the ansatz x = r cos θ (t),

y = r sin θ (t), the Lagrangian and equation of motion become

L =

¨θ = −

r2 ˙θ2 + jxr cos θ + jyr sin θ,

cos θ =

sin θ +

,

(B14)

(B15)

where jθ = −jx sin θ + jy cos θ is the tangential component of the force. The solution
satisfying the initial conditions θ0 = ˙θ0 = 0 is

θ = ˆ t

0

(t − τ )

jθ (τ )

r

dτ.

To linear order in jθ the x and y components are just

x = r cos θ = 0,

(t − τ ) jθ (τ ) dτ,

which, on putting jθ = jy + O(cid:0)j2

0

y = r sin θ = ˆ t
x,y(cid:1), gives
y = ˆ t

0

(t − τ ) jy (τ ) dτ,

(B16)

(B17)

(B18)

(B19)

which is just the solution obtained previously.

If in contrast we never imposed the constraints on the linear response solution we would

have the equations of motion

δ¨x = jx,
δ¨y = jy,

20

(B20)
(B21)

with the solutions

δx = ˆ t
δy = ˆ t

0

0

(t − τ ) jx (τ ) dτ,

(t − τ ) jy (τ ) dτ.

(B22)

(B23)

The δy component is correct but δx is in error already at linear order. In fact, the solution
should not even depend on jx until second order.
