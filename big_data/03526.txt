Cycles in graphs of ﬁxed girth with large size

J´ozsef Solymosi∗, Ching Wong†

Abstract

Consider a family of graphs having a ﬁxed girth and a large size.
We give an optimal lower asymptotic bound on the number of even
cycles of any constant length, as the order of the graphs tends to
inﬁnity.

Introduction

All graphs we consider in this article are simple graphs. We denote the size
of G by e(G) and the order of G by v(G). A j-path in G is a path of length
j in G. A j-cycle in G is a cycle of length j in G, and it is called an even
cycle if j is even. The girth of a graph G is the length of the shortest cycles
in G. For x ∈ V (G), let Γk
G(x) = Γk(x) denote the set of vertices of G having
distance exactly k from the vertex x.
In the following, the big-O notations f (n) = O(g(n)) are understood as
f (n) = O(g(n)) as n → ∞, where n denotes the order of a graph. The same
applies to Θ.

It is easy to see that a graph having large girth cannot have too many
edges. The famous Erd˝os girth conjecture asserts the existence of graphs of
any given girth with a size of maximum possible order.

Conjecture 1 (Erd˝os girth conjecture). For any positive integer m, there
exist a constant c > 0 depending only on m and a family of graphs {Gn} such
that v(Gn) = n, e(Gn) ≥ cn1+1/m and girth(Gn) > 2m.

Indeed, such size is maximum by the result of Bondy and Simonovits [2],
in which an explicit constant is given. They showed that a graph Gn of order
n with girth(Gn) > 2m has a size less than 100mn1+1/m.

This conjecture has been proved true for m = 1, 2, 3, 5. See [5], [3], [1]
and [7]. For a general m, Sudakov and Verstra¨ete [6] showed that if such
graphs exist, then they contain at least one cycle of any even length between
and including 2m + 2 and Cn, for some constant C > 0.
For (cid:96) > m, by counting the number of (2(cid:96) − 2m)-paths, one can show
that the number of 2(cid:96)-cycles in such graphs has an order not greater than
O(n2(cid:96)/m), provided that degGn(x) = Θ(n1/m) for any vertex x in Gn. We will
see in Section 2 that in the asymptotic case, one can assume this without
loss of generality. This suggests the deﬁnition of almost regularity given in
Section 2.

In this article, we give a lower bound on the number of 2(cid:96)-cycles when
(cid:96) = O(1), and conclude that the number of 2(cid:96)-cycles is Θ(n2(cid:96)/m). The precise
statement is the following.
Theorem 2. For any real number c > 0 and integers M, m with M > m ≥ 2,
there exist a constant α > 0 and an integer N such that if {Gn} is a family
of graphs satisfying v(Gn) = n, e(Gn) ≥ cn1+1/m and girth(Gn) > 2m, then
for n ≥ N and m + 1 ≤ (cid:96) ≤ M , the number of 2(cid:96)-cycles in Gn is at least
αn2(cid:96)/m.

We proceed as follows.

In Section 2, we show that by adjusting the
threshold N in our theorem, we can further assume that the graphs have
some nice properties, namely bipartite and almost regular. In Section 3, we
count the number of short even cycles in Gn up to length 4m. Finally, in
Section 4, we entend the argument to longer cycles, completing the proof of
the main theorem.

2 Reduction to a simpler case

In this section, we show that it suﬃces to consider only bipartite graphs
which are almost regular, deﬁned as follows.
Deﬁnition 3. Suppose {Gn} is a family of graphs with v(Gn) = n and
girth(Gn) > 2m, we say that {Gn} is almost regular if there exist c1, c2 > 0
such that c1n1/m ≤ deg(x) ≤ c2n1/m for any vertex x ∈ V (Gn).

It is a well-known fact that any graph has a bipartite subgraph with at
least half of its edges. It remains to construct subgraphs whose maximum
and minimum degree is of order n1/m. To achieve this, we repeatedly apply a
theorem of Bondy and Simonovits [2], which states that if an n-vertex graph
Gn has girth larger than 2m, then Gn has less than 100mn1+1/m edges.

First we delete vertices of small degree.

Lemma 4. For any real number c > 0 and integer m ≥ 2, there exists a con-
stant β > 0 such that any bipartite graph G of order n, size at least cn1+1/m
and girth larger than 2m has a subgraph H having at least βn vertices, at
least 9c
Proof. Let G = H0. For i ≥ 1, inductively deﬁne Hi to be the subgraph of
Hi−1 induced by all vertices having degree at least c
10n1/m in Hi−1. Then for
all i we have e(Hi) ≥ e(Hi+1) and

10n1+1/m edges and minimum degree at least

10n1/m.

and so there exists some j ≥ 0 such that Hi = Hj for all i ≥ j.

Set H = Hj, which has girth larger than 2m and size at least 9c

10n1+1/m.

Then,

or v(H) ≥ βn, where

Lemma 5. For every real number c > 0 and integer m ≥ 2, there exists
a constant γ > 0 such that any bipartite graph G of order n, size at least
cn1+1/m and girth larger than 2m has a subgraph H having at least n
2 vertices,
at least c

4n1+1/m edges and maximum degree at most γn1/m.

Proof. For any γ > 0, let Sγ be the set of vertices of G having degree at least
γn1/m, and let Tγ be the remaining vertices of G. We want to ﬁnd a γ so

large that H can be chosen as the subgraph G[Tγ] of G induced by Tγ. It
suﬃces to ﬁnd γ large enough so that e(G[Sγ]) < e(G)/4, e(Tγ, Sγ) < e(G)/2
and v(G[Tγ]) ≥ n/2.

Since both G and G[Sγ] have girth larger than 2m, we can apply the

result of [2] twice to obtain

e(G[Sγ]) < 100m|Sγ|1+1/m

The second condition can be obtained via its contrapositive. Suppose
e(Sγ, Tγ) ≥ c

Then apply Lemma 4 to Gγ, we get a subgraph Hγ of Gγ having ν ≥

in Tγ ∩ V (Hγ) has degree at least c
γ has
at most (cid:98)m/2(cid:99) internal vertices in Tγ, therefore the number of m-paths in
G(cid:48)

But the number of m-paths in G cannot be larger than n2, since otherwise

3 Counting short cycles

From now on, we suppose that G is a bipartite n-vertex graph having at
least cn1+1/m edges with girth larger than 2m, such that for some constants
c1, c2 > 0, there holds c1n1/m ≤ degG(x) ≤ c2n1/m for any vertex x ∈ V (G).
In this section, we give a lower bound on the number of the 2(cid:96)-cycles in
G, for each m + 1 ≤ (cid:96) ≤ 2m.

G (x) ∪ Γm+1

G (x). For each neighbor y in Γm

G (x) with endpoints w0 ∈ Γm

We ﬁrst sketch the idea. Let x be a vertex in G. Suppose we have a
path of odd length k in Γm
G (x) and
wk ∈ Γm+1
G (x) of wk, the four paths joining
x to w0, w0 to wk, wk to y, and y to x form a closed walk, which contains
a cycle, as shown in Figure 1. We show in Section 3.1 that generically these
paths are internally disjoint, i.e. the length of the cycle is 2m+k+1. Then we
count in Section 3.2 the number of such paths and the number of neighbours
of wk. Finally, we obtain the desired lower bound in Section 3.3.

Proof. Suppose the paths P x

contradiction.

3.2 Number of paths in Gx

Note that in Gx, the minimum degree can be as small as 1. Instead of count-
ing the number of paths of a given length in Gx, we work with a subgraph
of Gx having large minimum degree. We adopt the result from Section 2.

It is easy to see that v(Gx) ≤ n and

G (x)(cid:12)(cid:12)c1n1/m ≥(cid:0)c1n1/m(cid:1)m+1 = cm+1

3.3 Lower bound on the number of short cycles

The work in the preceding sections allows us to ﬁnd a lot cycles in G. It is
clear that a 2(cid:96)-cycle can be counted by at most 2(cid:96) times as each vertex of
the cycle can play the role of x once.

We are ready to give a lower bound on the number of short even cycles,

up to length 4m in G.

Proposition 8. Let m be a positive integer. Let G be a bipartite n-vertex
graph having girth larger than 2m and c1n1/m ≤ degG(v) ≤ c2n1/m for any
vertex v ∈ V (G), for some c1, c2 > 0. Then for m + 1 ≤ (cid:96) ≤ 2m, the number
of 2(cid:96)-cycles in G is at least α(cid:96)n2(cid:96)/m, where

4 Proof of main theorem

To count the number of longer cycles, we observe that Hx has all the nice
properties we wanted, namely bipartite, almost regular and large girth, we
can apply Proposition 8 to Hx and get many short cycles in Hx. From them,
we obtain a lot of paths in Hx, and each of them corresponds to many longer
cycles in G as in Section 3. These longer cycles give many longer paths in
Hx and again, each of these paths corresponds to many even longer cycles in
Gx. Eventually, we have Theorem 2.

For simplicity, we will assume that m is even from now on. For odd m,

one can proceed similarly.

Changing the parameters in Proposition 8, the number of 2(cid:96)-cycles in Hx

(cid:32)

(cid:33)2(cid:96)−2m+1

is at least

length 2(cid:96) − m ∈ {2m, 2m + 2, 2m + 4, . . . , 3m} in Hx is at least

Then, for 2(cid:96) ∈ L0, the number of ((2(cid:96) − m) + 2m + 2)-cycles in G is at least

is at least α(cid:96)n2(cid:96)/m, where α(cid:96) is a positive constant depending on m, c1, c2, (cid:96)
only. Repeating the same argument with the sets Lj := {3m+j(m+2), 3m+
j(m + 2) + 2, . . . , 4m + j(m + 2)}, the proof of Theorem 2 is completed.
