THE MOTIVE OF A SMOOTH THETA DIVISOR

HUMBERTO A. DIAZ

Abstract. We prove a motivic version of the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem for a smooth

ample divisor Θ on an Abelian variety. We use this to construct a motive P that realizes the

primitive cohomology of Θ.

1. Introduction

Let k be an algebraically closed ﬁeld. Given a smooth projective variety X of dimension d
over k and a Weil cohomology H ∗, there is a decomposition of the diagonal [∆X ] ∈ H 2d(X×X)
into its K¨unneth components:

∆X = ∆0,X + ... + ∆2d,X ∈ H 2d(X × X) ∼= M H j(X) ⊗ H 2d−j(X)

It is one of Grothendieck’s standard conjectures ([7] Section 4) that these K¨unneth components
arise from algebraic cycles; i.e., that there exist correspondences πj,X ∈ CH d(X ×X) for which
cl(πj,X) = ∆j,X under the cycle class map cl : CH d(X × X) → H 2d(X × X). We can state a
stronger version of this conjecture as follows:

Conjecture 1.1 (Chow-K¨unneth). There exist correspondences πj,X ∈ CH d(X × X) satis-
fying:

j,X = πj,X, πj,X ◦ πj ′,X = 0 for j 6= j′

(a) π2
(b) P πj,X = ∆X
(c) cl(πj,X) = ∆j,X for any choice of Weil cohomology.

In this stronger version, the correspondences πj,X are actually idempotents, which gives Chow
motives hj(X) = (X, πj,X , 0). Moreover, the decomposition of the diagonal into orthogonal
components gives a decomposition of the motive of X as L hj(X). An important problem in
the theory of motives is to understand these “underlying” objects hj(X) that represent the
various degrees of cohomology (for every choice of cohomology). The Chow-K¨unneth conjec-

ture is known to hold in some important cases: curves, surfaces ([10]), complete intersections
in Pn ([11] Chapter 6), Abelian varieties ([2]), elliptic modular varieties ([4]).

Suppose that A is an Abelian variety of dimension g and i : Θ ֒−→ A is a smooth ample

divisor. The ﬁrst goal of this note is then to prove the following:

Theorem 1.1. There exist correspondences πj,Θ ∈ CH g−1(Θ × Θ) satisfying conjecture 1.1.

The Lefschetz hyperplane theorem gives isomorphisms i∗ : H j(A) → H j(Θ) for j < g − 1
and i∗ : H j(Θ) → H j+2(A) for j > g − 1. The proof of Theorem 1.1 gives a particular set
of idempotents πj,Θ and we set hj(Θ) = (Θ, πj,Θ, 0). We also set hj(A) = (A, πj,A, 0), where
πj,A are the canonical idempotents constructed in [2]. We are then able to prove the following
motivic version of the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem:

Theorem 1.2.

(a) The pull-back hj(i) := πj,Θ ◦ tΓi ◦ πj,A : hj(A) → hj(Θ) is an isomor-

phism for j < g − 1.
(b) The push-forward t

hj(i) := πj+2,A ◦ Γi ◦ πj,Θ : hj(Θ) → hj+2(A)(1) is an isomorphism

for j > g − 1.

(c) hg−1(i) is split-injective and t
(d) There is an idempotent p ∈ CH g−1(Θ × Θ) which is orthogonal to πj,Θ for j 6= g − 1
and for which the motive P := (Θ, p, 0) satisﬁes H ∗(P ) = KΘ := ker(i∗ : H g−1(Θ) →
H g+1(A)).

hg−1(i) is split-surjective.

We can specialize to the case that k = C and H ∗ is singular cohomology with Q-coeﬃcients.

The primitive cohomology of Θ,

KΘ = ker(i∗ : H g−1(Θ, Q) → H g+1(A, Q)(1)),

is the only Hodge substructure of H ∗ not coming from A. So, one should expect to encounter
diﬃculty in analyzing the motive P . The simplest nontrivial case is when A is a principally
polarized Abelian fourfold and [Θ] ∈ CH 1(A) is its principal polarization. In this case, Θ is
generally a smooth divisor and H ∗(P ) = KΘ has Hodge level 1. Conjecturally, a motive over
C whose singular cohomology has Hodge level 1 should correspond to an Abelian variety ([?]

Remark 7.12). We have the following partial result:

Proposition 1.1. There exists an Abelian variety J such that h1(J)(−1) ∼= P ⇔ p∗CH0(Θ) =
0.

2. Preliminaries

Let Mk denote the category of Chow motives over k whose objects are triples (X, π, n),
where X is a smooth projective variety of dimension d, π ∈ CH d(X × X) is an idempotent
and n ∈ Z. The morphisms are deﬁned as follows:

HomMk ((X, π, n), (X ′, π′, n′)) := π′ ◦ Corn′−n(X, X ′) ◦ π

= π′ ◦ CH d+n′−n(X × X ′) ◦ π

Here, composition is deﬁned in [3] Chapter 16.1. There is a functor h : V opp
7→ Mk from the
category of smooth projective varieties over k with h(X) = (X, ∆X , 0) and with h(g) = tΓg

k

THE MOTIVE OF A SMOOTH THETA DIVISOR

for any morphism g : X → X ′. A Weil cohomology theory is a functor H ∗ : V opp
7→ V ecK
(with K is a ﬁeld of characteristic 0) satisfying certain axioms (described in [7] Section 4),

k

one of which is the Lefschetz hyperplane isomorphism. Examples include singular, ℓ-adic,
crystalline, or de Rham cohomology. This extends to a functor H ∗ : Mk 7→ V ecK , and for
M = (X, π, m), we have

H j(M ) = π∗H j+2m(X).

Also, there is the extension of scalars functor ()L : Mk 7→ ML for any ﬁeld extension k ⊂ L.
For M = (X, π, m), we will use the notation M (n) = (X, π, m−n) and 1(n) = (Spec k, ∆k, n).

Lemma 2.1 (Liebermann). Let hX : X ′ ⊢ X, hY : Y ⊢ Y ′ be correspondences of smooth
projective varieties. Then, for α ∈ CH ∗(X × Y ), β ∈ CH ∗(X ′ × Y ′), we have

(a) (hX × hY )∗(α) = hY ◦ α ◦ hX
(b) When f : X → X ′ and g : Y → Y ′ are morphisms, (f × g)∗(α) = Γg ◦ α ◦ tΓf .

Proof. See [3] Proposition 16.1.1.

(cid:3)

Theorem 2.1 (Shermenev, Deninger-Murre). Let A be an Abelian variety of dimension g
over k. Then, there is a unique set of idempotents {πj,A} ∈ CH g(A × A) satisfying conjecture
1.1 and the following relation for all n ∈ Z:

(1)

tΓn ◦ πj,A = nj · πj,A = πj,A ◦ tΓn

Proof. See [2] Theorem 3.1.

(cid:3)

Let i : Θ ֒→ A be a smooth ample divisor and let hj(A) = (A, πj,A, 0) be the motive for the

idempotents in Theorem 2.1. Then, we deﬁne the Lefschetz operator:

LΘ := ∆∗(Θ) ∈ CH g+1(A × A).

The most essential result for the proofs of theorems 1.1 and 1.2 is the following in [8], a

motivic version of the Hard Lefschetz theorem:

Theorem 2.2 (K¨unnemann). Assume that [Θ] = (−1)∗

A[Θ] ∈ CH 1(A).

(a) (LΘ)∗α = α ∪ [Θ] for α ∈ H ∗(A)
(b) The operator π2g−j,A ◦ Lg−j

Θ ◦ πj,A : hj(A)(g − j) → h2g−j(A) is an isomorphism of
motives for j ≤ g. That is, there exists a correspondence ΛΘ ∈ CH g−1(A × A) such
that the following relations hold for j ≤ g:
Θ ◦ Lg−j

Θ ◦ πj,A = πj,A

πj,A ◦ Λg−j

π2g−j,A ◦ Lg−j

Θ ◦ Λg−j

Θ ◦ π2g−j,A = π2g−j,A

(c) Set πj,A = 0 for all j /∈ {0, 1, ...2g}. Then, we have LΘ ◦ πj,A = πj+2,A ◦ LΘ and

ΛΘ ◦ πj,A = πj−2,A ◦ ΛΘ.

Proof. See [8] Theorem 4.1.

It should be noted that (b) holds more generally for Abelian

schemes. It is a technical result that uses properties of the Fourier transform for Chow groups

of Abelian schemes.

(cid:3)

By Theorem 2.2 (a) and the projection formula, we have (LΘ)∗ = ∪[Θ] = i∗ ◦ i∗. The result

below shows that this is true on the level of correspondences:

Lemma 2.2. LΘ = Γi ◦ tΓi ∈ CH g+1(A × A).

Proof. From the obvious commutative diagram:

(3)

Θ

iy

A

∆Θ−−−−→ Θ × Θ
i×iy
∆A−−−−→ A × A

we have LΘ = (∆A)∗(Θ) = (∆A)∗(i∗1) = (i × i)∗(∆Θ) = Γi ◦ ∆Θ ◦ tΓi = Γi ◦ tΓi, where the
penultimate step follows from Lemma 2.1 (b).
(cid:3)

3. Proofs of Theorems 1.1 and 1.2

Since k is algebraically closed, it’s possible to ﬁnd some a ∈ A(k) such that t∗

a[Θ] ∈ CH 1(A)
A[Θ] = [Θ], so that the results of the

is invariant under (−1)∗. So, we can assume that (−1)∗
previous section are applicable.

Proof of Theorem 1.1. For the proof, we will need to exhibit correspondences πj,Θ ∈ CH g−1(Θ×
Θ) which satisfy conjecture 1.1. These are given as follows:

(4)

πj,Θ = tΓi ◦ πj,A ◦ Λg−j
πj,Θ = tΓi ◦ Lj−g+1
πg−1,Θ = ∆Θ − X
j6=g−1

πj,Θ.

Θ ◦ Lg−j−1
Θ
◦ Λj−g+2

Θ

◦ Γi for j < g − 1,

◦ πj+2,A ◦ Γi for j > g − 1,

Since P πj,Θ = ∆Θ holds by deﬁnition, it suﬃces to check conditions (a) and (c) of conjec-

ture 1.1. For j < g − 1, we have

j,Θ = tΓi ◦ πj,A ◦ Λg−j
π2
= tΓi ◦ πj,A ◦ Λg−j
= tΓi ◦ πj,A ◦ Λg−j

Here, the second equality holds by Lemma 2.2, the third holds by Theorem 2.2 (b). Similarly,

for j > g − 1 we have:

j,Θ = tΓi ◦ πj,A ◦ Lj−g+1
π2

◦ Λj−g+2

= tΓi ◦ Lj−g+1

◦ πj+2,A ◦ Γi

Thus, π2
j,Θ = πj,Θ for j 6= g − 1. Before proving the same for j = g − 1, we show that the
orthogonality condition of (a) (in conjecture 1.1) holds; that is, πj,Θ ◦ πj ′,Θ = 0 for j 6= j′ and
j, j′ 6= g − 1. We do this for the case of j 6= j′ < g − 1:

πj,Θ ◦ πj ′,Θ = tΓi ◦ πj,A ◦ Λg−j

◦ Γi ◦ tΓi ◦ πj ′,A ◦ Λg−j ′

◦ Lg−j ′−1

◦ Lg−j ′−1

◦ Γi

◦ Lg−j ′−1

(5)

= 0

Again, the second equality holds by Lemma 2.2 and the last equality follows from the orthog-

onality condition in Theorem 2.1. The third equality holds because we have

πj,A ◦ Λg−j

Θ ◦ Lg−j

Θ = Λg−j

Θ ◦ Lg−j

Θ ◦ πj,A

which follows by repeated application of Theorem 2.2 (c). The remaining cases of orthogo-
nality (j 6= j′ and j, j′ 6= g − 1) are identical to (5).

What remains for the veriﬁcation of condition (a) is to show that:

g−1,Θ = πg−1,Θ

(i) π2
(ii) πg−1,Θ ◦ πj,Θ = 0 = πj,Θ ◦ πg−1,Θ for j 6= g − 1

For (i), let π = Pk6=g−1 πj,Θ. Since the summands are mutually orthogonal idempotents by
the preceding veriﬁcations, it follows that π2 = π. Since πg−1,Θ = ∆Θ − π by deﬁnition, we
have

π2
g−1,Θ = (∆Θ − π)2 = ∆Θ + π2 − 2π = ∆Θ − π = πg−1,Θ

For (ii), let j 6= g − 1 and note that

πg−1,Θ ◦ πj,Θ = (∆Θ − π) ◦ πj,Θ = πj,Θ − X
k6=g−1

πk,Θ ◦ πj,Θ

= πj,Θ − πj,Θ = 0

where the third equality holds since πk,Θ ◦ πj,Θ = 0 for j 6= k. Similarly, one has 0 =
πj,Θ ◦ πg−1,Θ. This completes the veriﬁcation of item (a) in conjecture 1.1.

Finally, we prove (c) in conjecture 1.1. It suﬃces to show that πj,Θ acts as the identity on
(Θ) for j 6= j′ and any Weil cohomology H ∗. One easily reduces

H j(Θ) and trivially on H j ′

6

HUMBERTO A. DIAZ

this to the case that j 6= g − 1. We will verify this for j < g − 1. Since πj,A acts as 0 on
H j ′
(A) for j 6= j′, we need only show that πj,Θ acts as the identity on H j(Θ). To this end,
let φ := Λg−j

◦ Γi so that

Θ ◦ Lg−j−1

Θ

πj,Θ = tΓi ◦ πj,A ◦ φ

Since H ∗ is a Weil cohomology, tΓi∗ = i∗ : H j(A) → H j(Θ) is an isomorphism (see [7]).
Moreover, by Hard Lefschetz, (φ ◦ tΓi)∗ = (Λg−j
Θ )∗ is the identity on H j(A). Thus,
i∗ and φ∗ are inverses, from which it follows that (πj,Θ)∗ is the identity on H j(Θ) for j <
g − 1. The case of j > g − 1 is nearly identical, only that one uses the fact that i∗ is an
isomorphism.

Θ )∗ ◦ (Lg−j

(cid:3)

Proof of Theorem 1.2. The statements of (a) and (b) are that hj(i) and t
hj(i) are isomor-
phisms for j < g − 1 and j > g − 1, respectively. To show this, we need to construct their

inverse isomorphisms:

φj := πj,A ◦ Λg−j
φj := πj,Θ ◦ tΓi ◦ Lj−g+1

Θ ◦ Lg−j−1

Θ

Θ

◦ Γi ◦ πj,Θ for j < g − 1

◦ Λj−g+2

Θ

◦ πj+2,A for j > g − 1

Then, for j < g − 1, we have

φj ◦ hj(i) = πj,A ◦ Λg−j
= πj,A ◦ Λg−j
= πj,A ◦ Λg−j

Θ ◦ Lg−j−1
Θ ◦ Lg−j−1

Θ

◦ Γi ◦ tΓi ◦ πj,A

Θ ◦ πj,A ◦ Λg−j

Θ ◦ Lg−j

Θ ◦ πj,A

= πj,A

where the third and fourth equalities hold by Theorem 2.2 (b). Similarly, we have

hj(i) ◦ φj = πj,Θ ◦ tΓi ◦ πj,A ◦ Λg−j

Θ ◦ Lg−j−1

Θ

◦ Γi ◦ πj,Θ

= π3

j,Θ = πj,Θ

We conclude that hj(i) and φj are inverses for j < g − 1, proving (a). For (b), we have

hj(i) and φj are inverses for j > g − 1. For (c), we need to show that hg−1(i) and t

So, t
are split-injective and split-surjective, respectively. Their left and right inverses will be:

hg−1(i)

(6)

φg−1 = πg−1,A ◦ ΛΘ ◦ Γi ◦ πg−1,Θ

ψg−1 = πg−1,Θ ◦ tΓi ◦ ΛΘ ◦ πg+1,A.

To this end, we begin by noting that for j < g − 1:

(7)

πj,Θ ◦ tΓi = tΓi ◦ πj,A ◦ Λj−g

Θ ◦ Lg−j

Θ

= tΓi ◦ πj,A

Similarly, we have Γi ◦ πj,Θ = πj+2,A ◦ Γi for j > g − 1. So, we write π = X
j6=g−1

πj,Θ as before

and obtain:

(8)

Γi ◦ π ◦ tΓi ◦ πg−1,A = X

Γi ◦ πj,Θ ◦ tΓi ◦ πg−1,A

πj+2,A ◦ Γi ◦ tΓi ◦ πg−1,A

LΘ ◦ πj,A ◦ πg−1,A + X
j>g−1

LΘ ◦ πj,A ◦ πg−1,A = 0

πj+2,A ◦ LΘ ◦ πg−1,A

where the third equality holds by the mutual orthogonality of πj,A and the fourth holds
because LΘ ◦ πj,A = πj+2,A ◦ LΘ. Thus, we have:

φg−1 ◦ hg−1(i) = πg−1,A ◦ ΛΘ ◦ Γi ◦ πg−1,Θ ◦ tΓi ◦ πg−1,A

= πg−1,A ◦ ΛΘ ◦ Γi ◦ (∆Θ − π) ◦ tΓi ◦ πg−1,A

= πg−1,A ◦ ΛΘ ◦ Γi ◦ tΓi ◦ πg−1,A − πg−1,A ◦ ΛΘ ◦ Γi ◦ π ◦ tΓi ◦ πg−1,A

= πg−1,A ◦ ΛΘ ◦ LΘ ◦ πg−1,A = πg−1,A

Here, the second term on the third line vanishes by (8). So, hg−1(i) is split-injective. A similar
calculation shows that t
hg−1(i) is split-surjective with right inverse ψj. The completes the
proof of (c).

Finally, for (d) we deﬁne:

g−1,Θ := tΓi ◦ πg−1,A ◦ ΛΘ ◦ Γi ∈ CH g−1(Θ × Θ)
π′

As in the proof of Theorem 1.1, one can show that π′
πj,Θ for j 6= g − 1. It follows that

g−1,Θ is an idempotent, is orthogonal to

Similarly, one has πg−1,Θ ◦ π′

g−1,Θ = π′

g−1,Θ. Write hg−1

(Θ) = (Θ, π′

g−1,Θ, 0) for the corre-

p := πg−1,Θ − π′

g−1,Θ ∈ CH g−1(Θ × Θ)

We have

p2 = (πg−1,Θ − π′

g−1,Θ)2 = π2

g−1,Θ + (π′
= πg−1,Θ + π′

g−1,Θ)2 − 2πg−1,Θ ◦ π′
g−1,Θ − 2π′

g−1,Θ = πg−1,Θ − π′

g−1,Θ

g−1,Θ = p

so that p is an idempotent. Write P := (Θ, p, 0) for the corresponding motive. We also have

p ◦ π′

g−1,Θ = (πg−1,Θ − π′

g−1,Θ) ◦ π′

g−1,Θ = π′

g−1,Θ − π′

g−1,Θ = 0

so that p and π′

g−1,Θ are orthogonal. This gives a decomposition of motives:

The same argument for Theorem 1.1 (c) shows that H ∗(hg−1

4. The complementary motive P

Now, let k = C and H ∗ be singular cohomology with Q-coeﬃcients. We consider the
case of A a prinicipally polarized Abelian variety, whose principal polarization is the class

of i : Θ → A. Since we are interested in the motive P , we need Θ to be nonsingular. The

simplest nontrivial case is that of g = 4, where a well-known result of Mumford in [9] is that
Θ is generally nonsingular. Now, let KΘ,Q := ker(i∗ : H g−1(Θ, Q) → H g+1(A, Q)(1)) be the
primitive cohomology. Then, we have the following:

Lemma 4.1. KΘ is a rational Hodge structure of level 1 and dimension 10.

Proof. Since H 3(Θ) and H 3(A) both have Hodge level 3, we need to show that i∗ : H 3,0(A) →
H 3,0(Θ) is an isomorphism. Since this map is already injective, it will suﬃce to show that
h3,0(Θ) = h3,0(A) = 4. By adjunction, ωΘ ∼= OΘ(Θ), so h0(Θ, OΘ(Θ)) = h3,0(Θ). We can use
the long exact sequence to compute h0(Θ, OΘ(Θ)):
0 → H 0(A, OA) → H 0(A, OA(Θ)) res−−→ H 0(Θ, OΘ(Θ)) → H 1(A, OA) → H 1(A, OA(Θ)) = 0

Since Θ is a principal polarization, h0(A, OA(Θ)) = 1 so that the restriction arrow is 0.
Moreover, h1(A, OA) = 4, so it follows that h3,0(Θ) = 4 = h3,0(A). Thus, i∗ : H 3,0(A) →
H 3,0(Θ) is an isomorphism and KΘ has Hodge level 1. To determine the dimension of KΘ,
we ﬁrst compute χ(Θ) = c3(T Θ). Applying the Chern polynomial to the adjunction sequence
in this case, one obtains that c3(T Θ) = −c1(O(Θ))·4 = −4! = −24. Using the Lefschetz
hyperplane theorem, one also computes that χ(Θ) = 42 − h3(Θ), so that h3(Θ) = 66. Since
h3(A) = (cid:0)8

3(cid:1) = 56, it follows that KΘ has dimension 10.

(cid:3)

Thus, H ∗(P, Q) has Hodge level 1 when g = 4. Now, consider the intermediate Jacobian

of KΘ:

J(KΘ) = KΘ,C/(F 2KΘ,C ⊕ KΘ,Z)

This is a principally polarized Abelian variety of dimension 5, and we have an isomorphism of
rational Hodge structures H 1(J(KΘ), Q)(−1) ∼= H 3(P, Q). The generalized Hodge conjecture
predicts that this isomorphism arises from a correspondence Γ ⊂ J(KΘ) × Θ. The existence
of Γ was proved in [5]. One may take this a step further and ask whether h1(J(KΘ))(−1)
and P are isomorphic as motives. Proposition 1.1 provides a partial answer to this; i.e., we
have h1(J(KΘ))(−1) ∼= P if p acts trivially on CH0(ΘL) for all ﬁeld extensions C ⊂ L (and
conversely). We will need the following deﬁnition for the proof:

Deﬁnition 4.1. We say that M = (X, π, 0) ∈ Mk has representable Chow group in codimen-
sion i if there exists a smooth complete (possible reducible) curve C and Γ ∈ CH i(C × X)
such that CH i
alg(XL) for every ﬁeld
extension k ⊂ L.

alg(XL) lies in ΓL∗CH 1

alg(ML) = πL∗CH i

alg(CL) ⊂ CH i

Proof of Proposition 1.1. Suppose that we have some Abelian variety J for which h1(J)(−1) ∼=
P . Then, applying CH 3(

) to both sides we obtain

p∗CH0(Θ) = p∗CH 3(Θ) ∼= CH 3(h1(J)(−1)) = CH 2(h1(J))

From [2] Theorem 2.19, we have CH 2(h1(J)) = 0 so that p∗CH0(Θ) = 0. For the converse,
observe that Θ can be deﬁned over some ﬁeld k which is the algebraic closure of a ﬁnitely

generated over Q. So, let Θk be a model for Θ over k. The operators used in the proof of
Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 (LΘ, ΛΘ, and πj,A) are well-behaved upon passage to an overﬁeld (see
[2] and [8]); thus, so is the correspondence pk ∈ Cor0(Θk × Θk) constructed above. This
means that pC coincides with p (as in the statement of Proposition 1.1), and the assumption
that p acts trivially on CH0 becomes the assumption that

pL∗CH 3(ΘL) = 0

for all overﬁelds k ⊂ L. Now, let P = (Θk, pk, 0). The task is then to ﬁnd an Abelian variety
J over k for which

h1(J)(−1) ∼= P

To this end, we begin with the following lemma:

Lemma 4.2. P has representable Chow group in codimension 2.

Proof of Lemma. We will drop the subscript k. We use the same argument as in [1]. There

is a localization sequence:

where the limit runs over all (possibly reducible) subvarieties D of codimension 1 and K =
C(Θ) is the function ﬁeld of Θ. We have (idΘ × K)∗∆Θ = ηK, the generic point of Θ. From
Lemma 2.2 (a), we have p = p ◦ ∆Θ = (p × idΘ)∗∆Θ so that

(idΘ × K)∗(p) = (idΘ × K)∗(p × idΘ)∗∆Θ = pK∗(idΘ × K)∗∆Θ = pK∗(ηK )

Since pK∗(ηK) = 0 by assumption, the exactness of (10) gives some subvariety D and α ∈
CH 2(Θ × D) for which p = (idΘ × jD)∗α. After desingularizing, we can assume that D is
smooth (although jD may no longer be an inclusion). By Lemma 2.2 (b), we have

p = (idΘ × jD)∗α = ΓjD ◦ α

alg(ΘL) ⊂ jD∗CH 1

Thus pL∗CH 2
means there is some smooth complete C and some Γ ∈ CH 1(C×D) such that ΓL∗CH 1

alg(DL). By the representability of the Picard functor, this
alg(CL) =
(cid:3)

alg(DL) for all ﬁeld extension k ⊂ L. This proves the lemma.

Thus, we see that the Chow group of P is representable in every codimension. By [12]

Theorem 3.4, it follows that the motive of P decomposes as

M 1(i)⊕ni ⊕ h1(Ji)(−i)

for integers ni and Abelian varieties Ji. Since the cohomology of P is 0 in all but degree 3,
this means that P ∼= h1(J)(−1) for some Abelian variety J. This gives the proposition.

(cid:3)

Remark 4.1. A more reﬁned version of Proposition 1.1 is that the Abelian variety can
Indeed, since we have H 1(J(KΘ), Q)(−1) ∼=
be taken to be J(KΘ) in the above notation.
H 3(P, Q) ∼= H 1(J, Q)(−1) (as rational Hodge structures), it follows that J and J(KΘ) are
isogenous.
