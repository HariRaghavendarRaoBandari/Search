A generalised Grad-Shafranov equation that governs the equilibrium of an axisymmetric
toroidal plasma with anisotropic pressure and incompressible ﬂow of arbitrary direction is de-
rived. This equation includes six free surface functions and recovers known Grad-Shafranov-
like equations in the literature as well as the usual static, isotropic one. The form of the
generalised equation indicates that pressure anisotropy and ﬂow act additively on equilib-
rium. In addition, two sets of analytical solutions, an extended Solovev one with a plasma
reaching the separatrix and an extended Hernegger-Maschke one for a plasma surrounded by a
ﬁxed boundary possessing an X-point, are constructed, particularly in relevance to the ITER
and NSTX tokamaks. Furthermore, the impacts both of pressure anisotropy and plasma
ﬂow on these equilibria are examined. It turns out that depending on the maximum value
and the shape of an anisotropy function, the anisotropy can act either paramagnetically or
diamagnetically. Also, in most of the cases considered both the anisotropy and the ﬂow have
stronger eﬀects on NSTX equilibria than on ITER ones.

INTRODUCTION

It has been established in a number of fusion devices that sheared ﬂow both zonal and
mean (equilibrium) play a role in the transitions to improved conﬁnement regimes as the L-H
transition and the Internal Transport Barriers [1], [2]. These ﬂows can be driven externally
in connection with electromagnetic power and neutral beam injection for plasma heating and
current drive or can be created spontaneously (zonal ﬂow). An additional eﬀect of external
heating, depending on the direction of the injected momentum, is pressure anisotropy which
also may play a role in several magnetic fusion related problems.

In many important plasmas as the high temperature ones the collision time is so long
that collisions can be ignored.
It would appear that for such collisionless plasmas a ﬂuid
theory should not be appropriate. However, for perpendicular motions because of gyromotion
the magnetic ﬁeld plays the role of collisions, thus making a ﬂuid description appropriate.
Macroscopic equations for a collisionless plasma with pressure anisotropy have been derived
by Chew, Goldberger, and Low [3] on the basis of a diagonal pressure tensor consisting of

one element parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld and a couple of identical perpendicular elements
associated with two degrees of freedom.

The MHD equilibria of axisymmetric plasmas, which can be starting points of stability
and transport studies, is governed by the well known Grad-Shafranov (GS) equation. The
most widely employed analytic solutions of this equation is the Solovev solution [4] and
the Hernegger-Maschke solution [5], the former corresponding to toroidal current density
non vanishing on the plasma boundary and the latter to toroidal current density vanishing
thereon. In the presence of ﬂow the equilibrium satisﬁes a generalised Grad-Shafranov (GGS)
equation together with a Bernoulli equation involving the pressure (see for example [6–8]).
For compressible ﬂow the GGS equation can be either elliptic or hyperbolic depending on the
value of a Mach function associated with the poloidal velocity. Note that the toroidal velocity
is inherently incompressible because of axisymmetry. In the presence of compressibility the
GGS equation is coupled with the Bernoulli equation through the density which is not uniform
on magnetic surfaces. For incompressible ﬂow the density becomes a surface quantity and
the GGS equation becomes elliptic and decouples from the Bernoulli equation (see section
II). Consequently one has to solve an easier and well posed elliptic boundary value problem.
In particular for ﬁxed boundaries, convergence to the solution is guaranteed under mild
requirements of monotonicity for the free functions involved in the GGS equation [9]. For
plasmas with anisotropic pressure the equilibrium equations involve a function associated
with this anisotropy [Eq. (8) below]. To get a closed set of reduced equilibrium equations an
assumption on the functional dependence of this function is required (cf. [10]-[16] for static
equilibria and [17]-[23] for stationary ones).

In this work we derive a new GGS equation by including both anisotropic pressure and
incompressible ﬂow of arbitrary direction. This equation consists of six arbitrary surface
quantities and recovers known equations as particular cases, as well as the usual GS equation
for a static isotropic plasma. Together we obtain a Bernoulli equation for the quantity p
[Eq. (9)], which may be interpreted as an eﬀective isotropic pressure. For the derivation we
assume that the function of pressure anisotropy is uniform on magnetic surfaces. In fact, as it
will be shown, for static equilibria as well as for stationary equilibria either with toroidal ﬂow
or incompressible ﬂow parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld, this property of the anisotropy function
follows if the current density shares the same surfaces with the magnetic ﬁeld. Then for appro-
priate choices of the free functions involved we obtain an extended Solovev solution describing
conﬁgurations with a non-predeﬁned boundary, and an extended Hernegger-Maschke solution
with a ﬁxed boundary possessing an X-point imposed by Dirichlet boundary conditions. On
the basis of these solutions we construct ITER-like, as well as NSTX and NSTX-Upgrade-
like equilibria for arbitrary ﬂow, both diamagnetic and paramagnetic, to examine the impact
both of pressure anisotropy and plasma ﬂow on the equilibrium characteristics. The main
conclusions are that the pressure anisotropy and the ﬂow act on equilibrium in an additive
way, with the anisotropy having a stronger impact than that of the ﬂow. Also the eﬀects of
ﬂow and anisotropy are in general more noticeable in spherical tokamaks than in conventional
ones.

The GGS equation for plasmas with pressure anisotropy and ﬂow is derived in section II.
In section III the generalised Solovev and Hernegger-Maschke solutions are obtained and em-
ployed to construct ITER and NSTX pertinent conﬁgurations. Then the impact of anisotropy
and ﬂow on equilibrium quantities, as the pressure and current density, are examined in sec-
tion IV. Section V summarizes the conclusions.

II. THE GENERALISED GRAD-SHAFRANOV EQUATION

The ideal MHD equilibrium states of an axially symmetric magnetically conﬁned plasma
with incompressible ﬂow and anisotropic pressure are governed by the following set of equa-
tions:

is a measure of the pressure anisotropy. Particle collisions in equilibrating parallel and per-
pendicular energies will reduce σd and therefore a collision-dominated plasma can be de-
scribed accurately by a scalar pressure. However, because of the low collision frequency a
high-temperature conﬁned plasma remains for long anisotropic, once anisotropy is induced
by external heating sources.

At this point we deﬁne the quantity

Owing to axisymmetry, the divergence-free ﬁelds, i.e., the magnetic ﬁeld, the current density,
(cid:126)J, and the momentum density of the ﬂuid element, ρ(cid:126)v, can be expressed in terms of the
stream functions ψ(R, z), I(R, z), F (R, z) and Θ(R, z) as

(cid:126)B = I (cid:126)∇φ + (cid:126)∇φ × (cid:126)∇ψ

(cid:126)J =

1
µ0

(∆∗ψ (cid:126)∇φ − (cid:126)∇φ × (cid:126)∇I)

and

ρ(cid:126)v = Θ(cid:126)∇φ + (cid:126)∇φ × (cid:126)∇F

(13)

(14)

(15)

Here, (R, φ, z) denote the usual right-handed cylindrical coordinate system; constant ψ
surfaces are the magnetic surfaces; F is related to the poloidal ﬂux of the momentum density
ﬁeld, ρ(cid:126)v; the quantity I = RBφ is related to the net poloidal current ﬂowing in the plasma and
the toroidal ﬁeld coils; Θ = ρRvφ; ∆∗ is the elliptic operator deﬁned by ∆∗ ≡ R2 (cid:126)∇ · ((cid:126)∇/R2);
and (cid:126)∇φ ≡ ˆeφ/R.

Equations (1)-(6) can be reduced by means of certain integrals of the system, which are
shown to be surface quantities. To identify two of these quantities, the time independent
electric ﬁeld is expressed by (cid:126)E = −(cid:126)∇Φ and the Ohm’s law, (6), is projected along (cid:126)∇φ and
(cid:126)B, respectively, yielding

(cid:126)∇φ · ((cid:126)∇F × (cid:126)∇ψ) = 0

and

(cid:126)B · (cid:126)∇Φ = 0

(16)

(17)

Equations (16) and (17) imply that F = F (ψ) and Φ = Φ(ψ). An additional surface quantity
is found from the component of Eq. (6) perpendicular to a magnetic surface:

(cid:48)

Φ

=

1
ρR2 (IF

(cid:48) − Θ)

(18)

where the prime denotes diﬀerentiation with respect to ψ. On the basis of Eq. (18) the
velocity [Eq. (15)] can be written in the form

(cid:126)v =

(cid:48)

F
ρ

(cid:126)B − R2Φ

(cid:48) (cid:126)∇ψ

(19)

5

Thus, (cid:126)v is decomposed into a component parallel to (cid:126)B and a non parallel one associated with
the electric ﬁeld in consistence with the Ohm’s law (6). Subsequently, by projecting Eq. (2)
along (cid:126)∇φ we ﬁnd a fourth surface quantity of the system:

X(ψ) ≡ (1 − σd − M 2

Therefore, irrespective of compressibility the equilibrium is governed by the equations (22)
and (23) coupled through the density, ρ, and the pressure anisotropy function, σd. Equation
(23) has a singularity when σd + M 2

p = 1, and so we must assume that σd + M 2

p (cid:54)= 1.

In order to reduce the equilibrium equations further, we employ the incompressibility

condition

(cid:126)∇ · (cid:126)v = 0

Then Eq. (1) implies that the density is a surface quantity,

ρ = ρ(ψ)

and so is the Mach function

p = M 2

(24)

(25)

(26)

In addition to obtain a closed set of equations following [10, 11, 16, 20] we assume that σd is
uniform on magnetic surfaces

σd = σd(ψ)

(27)
(20), which becomes X(ψ) = −Iσd, if in the

presence of anisotropy the current density remains on the magnetic surfaces (I = I(ψ)).
Since Mp = Mp(ψ), the same implication for σd holds for parallel incompressible ﬂow as well

6

as for toroidal ﬂow. Also, the hypothesis σd = σd(ψ), according to [10], may be the only
suitable for satisfying the boundary conditions on a rigid, perfectly conducting wall.

(cid:48)
1−σd(ψ) is a surface function, but also, I = ρ(ψ)Φ
(cid:48)

From Eqs. (18) and (20) it follows that axisymmetric equilibria with purely poloidal ﬂow
(Θ = 0) cannot exist because of the following contradiction: from Eq. (20) it follows that
I = X(ψ)
R2 from Eq. (18), implying that I
has an explicit dependence on R; so it cannot be a surface function. On the other hand, there
can exist an equilibrium with purely toroidal ﬂow, either “compressible”, in the sense that
the density varies on the magnetic surfaces, or an incompressible one with uniform density
ρ(ψ) thereon. For isotropic plasmas both kinds of these equilibria were examined in [24].

With the aid of Eq. (25), Eq. (22) can be integrated to yield an expression for the eﬀective

Therefore, in the presence of ﬂow the magnetic surfaces in general do not coincide with the
surfaces on which p is uniform. In this respect, the term containing ps(ψ) is the static part
of the eﬀective pressure which does not vanish when (cid:126)v = 0.

Finally, by inserting Eq. (28) into Eq. (23) after some algebraic manipulations, the latter

reduces to the following elliptic diﬀerential equation,

This is the GGS equation that governs the equilibrium for an axisymmetric plasma with
pressure anisotropy and incompressible ﬂow. For ﬂow parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld the
R4-term vanishes. For vanishing ﬂow Eq.
(29) reduces to the one derived in [11], when
the pressure is isotropic it reduces to the one obtained in [8], and when both anisotropy
and ﬂow are absent it reduces to the well known GS equation. Equation (29) contains six
arbitrary surface quantities, namely: X(ψ), Φ(ψ), ps(ψ), ρ(ψ), M 2
p (ψ) and σd(ψ), which can
be assigned as functions of ψ to obtain analytically solvable linear forms of the equation or
from other physical considerations.

A.

Isodynamicity

There is a special class of static equilibria called isodynamic for which the magnetic ﬁeld
magnitude is a surface quantity (| (cid:126)B| = | (cid:126)B(ψ)|) [25]. This feature can have beneﬁcial ef-
fects on conﬁnement because the grad-B drift vanishes and consequently plasma transport
perpendicular to the magnetic surfaces is reduced. Also, it was proved that the only possi-
ble isodynamic equilibrium is axisymmetric [26]. For fusion plasmas the thermal conduction
along (cid:126)B is fast compared to the heat transport perpendicular to a magnetic surface, so a good
assumption is that the parallel temperature is a surface function, T(cid:107) = T(cid:107)(ψ). Then, assum-
ing that the plasma obeys the ideal gas law, it follows that the parallel pressure becomes also
a surface function, p(cid:107) = p(cid:107)(ψ).

With the aid of these assumptions, and on the basis of Eqs. (19) and (22) it follows that

the magnitude of the magnetic ﬁeld is related with the perpendicular pressure as

Consequently, the only possibility for isodynamic magnetic surfaces to exist is that for ﬁeld

| (cid:126)B|2 =

(32)

Eqs. (8) and (32) imply that both | (cid:126)B|2 = | (cid:126)B|2(ψ) and p⊥ = p⊥(ψ).

Thus, the conclusions for the isotropic case [8] are generalised for anisotropic pressure, i.e.
all three B, p(cid:107) and p⊥ become surface quantities. We note here that the more physically
pertinent case that B and p⊥ remain arbitrary functions would require either compressibility
or eliminating the assumption σd = σd(ψ). However, in this case tractability is lost and the
problem requires numerical treatment.

Transformation (33) does not aﬀect the magnetic surfaces, it just relabels them by the ﬂux
function u, and is a generalisation of that introduced in [27] for isotropic equilibria with
incompressible ﬂow (σd = 0) and that introduced in [11] for static anisotropic equilibria
p = 0). Note that no quadratic term as |(cid:126)∇u|2 appears anymore in (34). Once a solution
(M 2
of this equation is found, the equilibrium can be completely constructed with calculations in
the u-space by using (33) and the inverse transformation

ψ(u) =

(1 − σd(g) − M 2

p (g))−1/2dg

(35)

Before continuing to the construction of analytical solutions, we ﬁnd it convenient
ξ = R/Ri, ζ =

to make a normalization by introducing the dimensionless quantities:

8

i , (cid:101)I = I/BiRi, (cid:101)(cid:126)E = (cid:126)E/vAiBi, (cid:101)(cid:126)B = (cid:126)B/Bi, (cid:101)(cid:126)J =
z/Ri,(cid:101)p = p/(B2
(cid:126)J/(Bi/µ0Ri),(cid:101)(cid:126)v = (cid:126)v/vAi. The index i can be either a or 0, where a denotes the magnetic axis,

i /µ0), (cid:101)ρ = ρ/ρi,(cid:101)u = u/BiR2

and 0 the geometric center of a conﬁguration. Thus, the normalization constants are deﬁned
as follows: Ri is the radial coordinate of the conﬁguration’s magnetic axis/geometric center,
and Bi, ρi, vAi = Bi√
are the magnitude of the magnetic ﬁeld, the plasma density, and the
µ0ρi
Afv´en velocity thereon. Consequently, with the use of the generalised transformation (33),
Eqs. (13)-(15), (20), (28), and (34), are put in the following normalized forms in u-space:

This solution does not include enough free parameters to impose desirable boundary condi-
tions, but has the property that a separatrix is spontaneously formed. Thus, we can predeﬁne
the position of the magnetic axis, (ξa = 1, ζa = 0), chosen as normalization point and the
plasma extends from the magnetic axis up to a closed magnetic surface which we will choose
to coincide with the separatrix.

For an up-down symmetric (about the midplane ζ = 0) magnetic surface, its shape can be
characterized by four parameters, namely, the ξ coordinates of the innermost and outermost
points on the midplane, ξin and ξout, and the (ξ, ζ) coordinates of the highest (upper) point
of the plasma boundary, (ξup, ζup) (see Fig. 14). In terms of these four parameters we can
deﬁne the normalized major radius

magnetic surface normalized with respect to minor radius, and the elongation of a magnetic

(54)

Usually, we specify the values of R0, α, t, and κ, instead of (ξin, ξout, ξup, ζup) to characterize
the shape of the outermost magnetic surface. On the basis of solution (50) the latter quantities
can be expressed in terms of , δ, λ. Subsequently, in order to make an estimate of realistic
values for the free parameters , δ and the radial coordinate of the magnetic axis Ra in
connection with the tokamaks under consideration, we employ the relations (51)-(54) to ﬁnd
(, δ and Ra) in terms of the known parameters (R0, α, t and κ). (For ITER: R0 = 6.2 m,
α = 2.0 m, κ = 1.7, t = 0.33 / for NSTX: R0 = 0.85 m, α = 0.67 m, κ = 2.2, t = 0.5). In the
static limit (λ = 0) this estimation procedure can be performed analytically and when the
plasma is diamagnetic we ﬁnd

Relations (55)-(56) will also be employed to assign values of the free parameters , δ and
Ra for non parallel ﬂows (λ (cid:54)= 0) because in this case the above estimation procedure be-
comes complicated. Afterwards, since the vacuum magnetic ﬁeld at the geometric center of
a conﬁguration is known (ITER: B0 = 5.3 T / NSTX: B0 = 0.43 T ), we can also estimate its
value on the magnetic axis by using the relation Ba = B0

tokamak axis of symmetry in accordance with the small hole of spherical tokamaks. It may
be noted that such D-shaped conﬁgurations are advantageous for improving stability with
respect to the interchange modes because of the smaller curvature on the high ﬁeld side. On
the other hand, in a paramagnetic conﬁguration the plasma reaches through a corner the axis
of symmetry implying values for the minor radius diﬀerent from the actual ones, and thus,
such a conﬁguration is not typical for conventional tokamaks. However, a conﬁguration with
a similar corner was observed recently in the QUEST spherical tokamak as a self organized
state [34] (Fig. 5 therein).

B. Hernegger-Maschke-like solution

Since the charged particles move parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld free of magnetic force,
parallel ﬂows is a plausible approximation. In particular for tokamaks this is compatible with
the fact that the toroidal magnetic ﬁeld is an order of magnitude larger than the poloidal one
and the same scaling is valid for the toroidal and poloidal components of the ﬂuid velocity.
Also, for parallel ﬂows the problem remains analytically tractable and leads to a generalised
Hernegger-Maschke solution to be constructed below.

The value of Mpa depends on the kind of tokamak (conventional or spherical). On account
of experimental evidence [35, 36], the toroidal rotation velocity in tokamaks is approximately
104 − 106 ms−1 which for large conventional ones implies M 2

pa ∼ 10−2) [29]. In addition, from the requirement of pos-
stronger for spherical tokamaks (M 2
itiveness for all pressures within the whole plasma region, we ﬁnd that the pressure anisotropy
parameter σda takes higher values on spherical tokamaks than in the conventional ones, as
shown on Table I; also it must be n ≥ 2. An argument why the ﬂow and pressure anisotropy
are stronger in spherical tokamaks is that in this case the magnetic ﬁeld is strongly inhomo-
geneous, as the aspect ratio is too small. In contrast, for the generalised Hernegger-Maschke
equilibrium the pressure anisotropy takes a little higher values on ITER rather than on the
NSTX-U tokamak, and this may be attributed to a peculiarity of this solution.

ξ ). As shown in Fig. (6), as σda becomes larger the ﬁeld increases, and for suﬃcient
high σda it becomes peaked on the magnetic axis. This means that increasing pressure
anisotropy acts paramagnetically in terms of its maximum value on axis, σda. Additionally,
plasma ﬂow through M 2
pa also acts paramagnetically, but its eﬀects are weaker than that of
pressure anisotropy, as shown in Fig. (7). On the other side, pressure anisotropy may also
act diamagnetically through the shaping parameter n when σda is ﬁxed [cf. Fig. (8)].

current density monotonically increases from ξin to ξout:

Hernegger-Maschke solution has a more realistic (cid:101)Jφ proﬁle peaked on the magnetic axis and
vanishing on the boundary. In this case (cid:101)Jφ slightly increases with anisotropy.
Furthermore, in the presence of pressure anisotropy the poloidal component (cid:101)Jζ of the
Solovev and the radial (cid:101)Jξ of the Hernegger-Maschke solution, present two extrema on the

plane (ζ = ζa) containing the magnetic axis with their absolute values to be increasing with

V. CONCLUSIONS

A generalised Grad-Shafranov equation [Eq. (29)] governing axisymmetric plasma equilib-
ria in the presence of pressure anisotropy and incompressible ﬂow was derived. This equation
recovers known GS-like equations governing static anisotropic equilibria and isotropic equi-

libria with plasma ﬂow. Also for static isotropic equilibria the equation is reduced to the
usual well known GS equation. The derivation was based on a diagonal pressure tensor with
one element parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld, p(cid:107), and two equal perpendicular ones, p⊥. As a
measure of the pressure anisotropy we introduced the function σd = µ0
, assumed to be
uniform on magnetic surfaces, while the ﬂow was expressed by the poloidal Alfv´enic Mach
function Mp = vpol
, where vApol is the Alfv´en velocity. The form of the equation containing

p + σd indicates that pressure anisotropy and ﬂow act additively with the only
exception the electric ﬁeld term. In addition we derived a generalised Bernoulli equation [Eq.

On the basis of a simpler form of the GGS equation obtained by a generalised transforma-

with the plasma boundary coinciding with a seperatrix, and an extended Hernegger-Maschke
solution with a ﬁxed boundary possessing an X-point imposed by appropriate boundary con-
ditions, were derived. Employing these solutions, ITER, NSTX and NSTX-U-like equilibria
for arbitrary ﬂow, both diamagnetic and paramagnetic, were constructed. In addition, we
examined the impact of anisotropy -through the parameters σda and n, deﬁning the maxi-
mum value and the shape of the function σd- and ﬂow -through the Alfv´enic Mach number
M 2
p - on the equilibria constructed and came to
the following conclusions.

pa deﬁning the maximum of the function M 2

Pressure anisotropy has a stronger impact on equilibrium than that of the ﬂow because
the maximum permissible values of σda are in general higher than the respective M 2
pa ones,
with the eﬀects of the ﬂow to be more noticeable in the spherical tokamaks. In addition,
both anisotropy and ﬂow through the parameters σda and M 2
pa have an additive paramag-
netic impact on equilibrium, with stronger paramagnetic eﬀects in spherical tokamaks, while
anisotropy through n acts diamagnetically. Furthermore, pressure anisotropy has an appre-
ciable impact on equilibrium quantities such as the current density, the toroidal velocity and
the parallel and perpendicular pressures, while p is slightly aﬀected by the pressure anisotropy
and more by the ﬂow.

On the basis of the GGS obtained in this study one can develop a code to solve the prob-
lem for arbitrary choices of the free functions involved in order to deal with experimental
equilibrium proﬁles or extend existing codes, e.g. the isotropic HELENA code for incom-
pressible parallel ﬂows [39]. Also, it is interesting to extend the papers on static equilibria
with reversed current density [40]-[44] in the presence of incompressible ﬂow and pressure
anisotropy.
In addition, the study can be extended for the more general case of helically
symmetric equilibria.

Let us ﬁnally note that complete understanding of the equilibrium with plasma ﬂow and
pressure anisotropy requires substantial additional work in connection with compressibility,
alternative potentially more pertinent physical assumptions on the functional dependence of
the anisotropy function σd and more realistic numerical solutions. However, in these cases
the reduced equilibrium equations are expected to be much more complicated compared with
the relative simple GGS derived in the present study which contributes to understanding the
underlying physics.

An up-down asymmetric boundary consisting of a smooth upper part and a lower part
that possesses an X-point, is described by the parametric equations introduced in [45], with
its boundary being represented by the following characteristic points shown in Fig. (14):

Inner point : (ξin = 1 − α

, ζin = 0)

Outer point : (ξout = 1 + α

In order to calculate the unknown coeﬃcients of the solution we will impose the condition

that (cid:101)u∗ vanishes on the boundary. Function (cid:101)u∗ is in general complex, and since it satisﬁes

the GGS equation, then both its real and imaginary parts are also solutions of this equation.
Here, following Ref. [46] we will work with the imaginary part of the ﬂux function. So the
ﬁrst four conditions are:

Im[(cid:101)u∗(ξin, ζin)] = Im[(cid:101)u∗(ξout, ζout)] = Im[(cid:101)u∗(ξup, ζup)] = Im[(cid:101)u∗(ξx, ζx)] = 0

(A4)

by the parametric equations given in [45].

In addition, ﬁve boundary conditions related with the ﬁrst derivative of these characteristic

points are imposed:

ξ(ξup, ζup)] = Im[(cid:101)u∗

ζ(ξx, ζx)] = Im[(cid:101)u∗

ζ(ξin, ζin)] = Im[(cid:101)u∗

ζ = ∂(cid:101)u∗

ξ = ∂(cid:101)u∗

Im[(cid:101)u∗
where, (cid:101)u∗
second derivatives of(cid:101)u∗ related with the curvature of the boundary curve in the characteristic

∂ξ . The above conditions guarantee smoothness of the curve
at the characteristic points; particularly, the curve is imposed to be perpendicular to the
midplane. Furthermore, there exist three other conditions introduced in [47], that involve the

points. These are:

where the parameter w1 relates to the triangularity of the boundary, sinw1 = t. Thus, for

ITER-like characteristics, by setting jmax = 4 and choosing the free parameters (cid:101)p2 = 19.5,
(cid:101)X1 = −0.3, by the imposition of the above conditions we ﬁnd the values for the unknown

coeﬃcients presented on Table II.

Once the solution (cid:101)u∗(ρ, ζ) is fully determined, we can ﬁnd the position of the magnetic
axis, by solving the equations Im[(cid:101)u∗
of which gives a1 = 1.07751. Thus, solution (cid:101)u is fully determined, with its value on axis to
be(cid:101)ua = −0.0416752. Closed magnetic surfaces associated with(cid:101)u-contours of the equilibrium
