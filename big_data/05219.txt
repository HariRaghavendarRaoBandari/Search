FeSe exhibits a novel ground state in which superconductivity coexists with a nematic order in the absence of
any long-range magnetic order. Here we report an angle-resolved photoemission study on the superconducting
gap structure in the nematic state of FeSe0.93S0.07, without the complication caused by Fermi surface reconstruc-
tion induced by magnetic order. We found that the superconducting gap shows a pronounced 2-fold anisotropy
around the elliptical hole pocket near the Z point of the Brillouin zone, with gap minima at the endpoints of its
major axis, while no detectable gap was observed around the zone center and zone corner. The large anisotropy
and nodal gap distribution demonstrate the substantial eﬀects of the nematicity on the superconductivity, and
thus put strong constraints on the current theories.

The pairing mechanism underlying unconventional super-
conductivity is often related to the quantum ﬂuctuations of
nearby orders. In most Fe-based superconductors, both mag-
netic and nematic orders appear simultaneously near the
superconducting state. Accordingly, both spin-ﬂuctuation-
mediated and orbital-ﬂuctuation-mediated superconducting
pairing mechanisms have been proposed [1–5]. Although in-
tense experimental studies have been conducted [6–13], the
exact pairing mechanism of Fe-based superconductors is still
under heated debate.

FeSe is a unique material with a novel superconducting
state. Orbital order develops in the nematic state of FeSe with-
out breaking the translational symmetry as shown by angle re-
solved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) studies [14, 15].
The superconductivity coexists with the nematic order with-
out any long range magnetic order [16], thus disentangling
the magnetic and orbital orders. Moreover, recent results sug-
gest that FeSe is a quantum paramagnet [4] with coexisting
N´eel and stripe antiferromagnetic interactions [17, 18]. The
novel ground state in FeSe provides a fresh perspective for
studying the eﬀect of nematic order on the superconducting
gap structure in the absence of the Fermi surface reconstruc-
tion induced by magnetic order, which helps to reveal the roles
of spin and orbital degrees of freedom in unconventional su-
perconductivity. A nodeless superconducting gap structure in
FeSe was suggested by previous reports on speciﬁc heat [19],
Andreev reﬂection spectroscopy [20], and thermal conductiv-
ity measurements [21]. In contrast, scanning tunnelling spec-
troscopy (STS) studies on FeSe ﬁlms [22] and transport mea-
surements on bulk FeSe/FeSe1−xSx crystals with improved
quality [23, 24] all demonstrate a nodal gap structure. How-
ever, due to the low Tc and small gap size of FeSe/FeSe1−xSx
single crystals, the gap distribution in momentum-space is still
unknown.

In this work, we studied the superconducting gap struc-
ture of high-quality FeSe0.93S0.07 single crystals (Tc = 10 K)
with high resolution ARPES [25]. At 6.3 K, both the ne-
matic electronic structure and the superconducting gap are
observed. The gap amplitude at the hole pocket is 2.5 meV
, similar to that measured by STS [23]. The superconducting
gap shows 2-fold anisotropy around the Z point, and is unde-
tectable around the hole Fermi surface near the zone center
and the electron pockets at the zone corners. We ﬁnd that the
unique gap structure observed here cannot be resonably ﬁt-
ted by most known theoretical gap structures and their simple
combinations, which suggest that the eﬀects of nematicity on
the superconductivity are substantial.

FeSe0.93S0.07 single crystals were grown using AlCl3/KCl
ﬂux in a temperature gradient (from 400 ◦C to ∼50 ◦C) for
45 days [25, 26]. The ARPES measurements were conducted
at the I05 beamline at the Diamond Light Source. The data
were taken at the temperature of 6.3 K unless otherwise spec-
iﬁed. The single crystals were cleaved in-situ and measured
under ultra-high vacuum of 1×10−10 mbar. For data collection
with 23 eV (37 eV) photons, the energy resolution was 3 meV
(5 meV). Empirically, this allows resolving a superconducting
gap of 0.6 meV (1 meV).

Figure 1(a) illustrates the Fermi surfaces of FeSe/FeSe1−xSx
in the nematic state, which consist of one hole pocket at the
zone center and one electron pocket at the zone corner of the
2-Fe Brillouin zone [14, 28]. There is another electron pocket
(δ) around A1/A2 according to the calculation and quantum
oscillation measurements[14, 28], but it has not been detected
by ARPES probably due to its small matrix element [14]. In
our data, the elliptical hole pocket α around the Z point is re-
solved in Fig. 1(b). Another elliptical hole pocket α′, with
weaker spectral intensity, is contributed by 90 ◦-rotated twin
domains. The distribution of spectral weight is nearly iden-

tical to that of FeSe under the same experimental geome-
try with linear horizontal polarized photons [14], indicating
the similar orbital contents on the α pocket [Fig. 1(c)]. The
electron pocket ε around the zone corner (A1/A2) is elon-
gated [Fig. 1(d)]. Figure 1(e) shows the photoemission spectra
along Z-A1, clearly indicating the splitting of 50 meV between
bands ε and ε′ due to the nematic order [14].

At 6.3 K, band α shows a back-bending dispersion and
gap opening [Fig. 1(f)], which are the hallmarks of Bogli-
ubov quasiparticles. Sharp quasiparticle peaks are observed
at the Fermi crossings of band α at 10.9 K, and become
even sharper at 6.3 K [Fig. 1(g)], indicating the high qual-
ity of the FeSe0.93S0.07 single crystals. From 10.9 K to
6.3 K, the leading edge shifts below the Fermi energy [in-
set of Fig. 1(g)], indicating the opening of the supercon-
ducting gap. The superconducting gap size determined by
the symmetrized energy distribution curves (EDCs) is around
2.5 meV at 6.3K [Fig. 1(h)], which decreases with increas-
ing temperature and eventually closes around 9.2 K following
the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieﬀer formula [Fig. 1(i)], consistent
with the Tc of 10 K measured by transport experiments [25].
The momentum distribution of the superconducting gap on
the hole pockets α and α′ has been studied along the par-
allel momentum cuts in Fig. 2(a) with 23 eV photons.
In
the symmetrized photoemission intensity along cut #2, α′ is
gapped at momenta k3 and k4, whereas α crosses the Fermi
level at momenta k2 and k5 without any observable gap open-
ing [Fig. 2(b)], indicating distinct gap sizes between the mo-
menta near the major axis endpoints of pocket α and those

near the minor axis endpoints of pocket α′. As shown by the
symmetrized EDCs in Fig. 2(c), the superconducting gap is re-
duced around the major axis endpoints of the elliptical Fermi
surface α (θ ≃ 90 ◦ and 270 ◦). Around the minor axis end-
points of pocket α′, the gap size remains constant [Fig. 2(d)].
By the empirical ﬁtting to a superconducting spectral function
[30], the sizes of superconducting gap as a function of polar
angle θ are summarized in one single polar plot [Fig. 2(e)],
noting that the α and α′ are identical bands from twin do-
mains. The superconducting gap on band α shows anisotropy
with 2-fold symmetry. The gap size decreases from about
2.5 meV at the minor axis endpoints of the ellipse, to less
than 0.6 meV around the major axis endpoints, which is at the
experimental resolution limit.

The photoemission spectra at the Fermi crossing of band ε’
show sharp quasiparticle peaks in the superconducting state
[Fig. 2(f)]. However, no superconducting gap is detected
along the electron pockets ε or ε’ [Fig. 2(g)]. The absence
of a superconducting gap at these momenta indicates nodes or
a small gap size below the experimental resolution limit.

Figure 3(a) illustrates the photoemission cuts through bands
α and α′ around the Γ point with 37 eV photons. The bands
α and α′ are resolved along cut #3 [Fig. 3(b)], showing
sharp quasiparticle peaks at the Fermi crossings [Fig. 3(c)].
Along the elliptical Fermi surface α′, the symmetrized EDCs
show no detectable superconducting gap [Fig. 3(d)], indicat-
ing nodes or a small gap size below the experimental resolu-
tion limit. For band α, the Fermi crossings with polar angles
264.0 ◦ and 275.0 ◦ show no observable gap either [Fig. 3(e)].

occur on a small portion of the Fermi surface, while most of
the momenta without a detectable gap in our data must exhibit
a ﬁnite gap at much lower temperatures. Though the precise
positions of nodes in these regions will have to be determined
with better resolution in future studies, the momentum depen-
dent gap structure, especially the large gap anisotropy at the α
pocket showing remarkable component of cos 2θ with 2-fold
symmetry [Fig. 4(a)], put constraints on current theories of su-
perconductivity in FeSe. The the observed gap structure can
be used to scrutinize four types of current scenarios:

First, in the case of superconductivity with dominant s++
pairing mediated by orbital ﬂuctuations, the gap form is nearly
isotropic and nodeless [5]. The large anisotropy and nodal
behavior of the gap in FeSe suggest that the superconducting
pairing in FeSe is not mediated by pure orbital ﬂuctuations.

Second, in s± pairing mediated by magnetic interactions,
the sign-changing gap form may lead to gap anisotropy
and nodes [32, 33].
Since both N´eel and stripe spin-
ﬂuctuations exist in FeSe [18], if the s± superconducting pair-
ing were generated either by the (π, π) interaction with gap
form cos kx cos ky, or by the (π, 0) interaction with gap form
(cos kx + cos ky)/2 [33], the anisotropy of the superconduct-
ing gap on the elliptical α pocket would be 3% and 6% for
these two gap forms, respectively. These cannot account for

The quasiparticle peaks at ∼ ±4 meV for θ = 80.6 ◦ and 95.0 ◦
are contributed by band α′, which gives false signatures of
gap opening in Fig. 3(e). Actually as shown in Figs. 3(f) and
3(g), the EDCs divided by the resolution-convolved Fermi-
Dirac function are ﬂat within 2-3 meV of the Fermi crossings
of band α, indicating no detectable gap opening. As shown in
the Supplementary Material [29], the gap amplitude decreases
from Z to Γ untill it diminishes, which is intriguingly oppo-
site to those observed in BaFe2(As1−xPx)2 and Ba1−xKxFe2As2
[30, 31], where the gap of the α band decreases from Γ to Z.
Our results conﬁne the nodes to the vicinity of the two end-
points on the elliptical α pocket around Z, the α pocket around
Γ, and the electron pockets. Considering that the STS spectra
on superconducting FeSe1−xSx [23] show ﬁnite but small den-
sity of states at the Fermi energy at 0.4 K, the nodes can only

the large anisotropy of at least 78% observed in our data.

If there were static stripe antiferromagnetic order with wave
vector (π, 0), the electron pockets would have been folded to
the zone center and intersect with the α pocket around the
major axis endpoints in FeSe [Fig. 4(b)]. Theory suggests that
gap nodes would emerge at the reconstructed Fermi surfaces,
given a large value of antiferromagnetic order parameter [34].
However, FeSe shows no static magnetic order, thus its gap
anisotropy cannot be explained by this scenario.

Third, a composite form of superconducting pairing may
arise from the quantum paramagnet ground state with N´eel
and stripe spin ﬂuctuations [4, 18]. In Fig. 4(a), we ﬁt the gap
anisotropy of the α pocket by [22]

∆s±,s± = ∆1 cos kx cos ky + ∆2(cos kx + cos ky)/2,

which gives superconducting gap sizes ∆1=-58.2±8.8 meV
and ∆2=62.2±9.2 meV for s± pairing mediated by the two
kinds of spin ﬂuctuations. Moreover, the combination of N´eel
spin ﬂuctuation mediated d-wave pairing and stripe spin ﬂuc-
tuation mediated s± pairing with the gap form

∆d,s± = ∆d(cos kx − cos ky)/2 + ∆2(cos kx + cos ky)/2,

also gives good ﬁtting with ∆1=30.3±2.8 meV and
∆2=2.24±0.09 meV [Fig. 4(a)]. Alternatively, by com-
bining the spin-ﬂuctuation-mediated s± pairing and orbital-
ﬂuctuation-mediated s++ pairing [5], the gap anisotropy at
pocket α can be ﬁtted by

∆s±,s++ = ∆2(cos kx + cos ky)/2 + ∆s,

with ∆2=32.8±4.8 meV and ∆s=-28.7±4.4 meV for s± and
s++ pairing, respectively [Fig. 4(a)]. All three ﬁttings contain
gap amplitudes over 30 meV, which are nonphysical compared
with the low Tc of FeSe. Moreover, the obtained gap forms

4

would give a large gap at the ε pocket [Figs. 4(c)-4(e)], in
contrast to the undetectable superconducting gap in our data.
Therefore, these simple combinations of gap forms cannot ac-
count for the large gap anisotropy on pocket α.

Fourth, we consider an orbital-dependent superconducting
pairing symmetry. The orbital anti-phase pairing cannot ex-
plain the gap anisotropy on pocket α [35, 36], because the
orbital composition changes around θ = ±45◦ and ±135◦
[Fig. 1(c)], rather than at the major axis endpoints where the
gap minima appear. On the pocket α, the Fermi surface sec-
tions showing gap minima and gap maxima coincide with
those with dxz and dyz orbital characters, respectively, indicat-
ing that the orbital ordering may lead to weaker superconduct-
ing pairing of dxz orbital than that of dyz orbital. Alternatively,
it was shown that the orbital ordering may mix diﬀerent pair-
ing symmetries and give rise to pairs of accidental nodes [37].
The positions of the nodes depend on the splitting between dxz
and dyz orbital, which was set to 80 meV in the theory, while
it is 50 meV in FeSe0.93S0.07 [Fig. 1(e)]. In this scenario, if a
pair of nodes are located very close to a major-axis endpoint
of the α pocket due to a strong nematic order [Fig. 4(f)], the
gap would exhibit just one minimum at each endpoint in the
data due to the limited momentum resolution, which would be
consistent with our ﬁndings.

In summary, we have revealed the superconducting gap
structure of FeSe0.93S0.07 under the eﬀect of nematic order
and in the absence of magnetic order for the ﬁrst time. The
remarkable anisotropy of the superconducting gap rules out
s++ pairing purely mediated by orbital ﬂuctuations. The gap
amplitude decreases from Z to Γ, till it is undetectable at Γ,
which is intriguingly diﬀerent from that of BaFe2(As1−xPx)2
with a nodal ring around Z. A 2-fold anisotropy of the su-
perconducting gap is observed at the α hole pocket around Z,
which cannot be understood by current theories unless the ef-
fects of nematicity are considered. Our results suggest that
in order to comprehensively understand this unique family of
FeSe1−xSx, future theories should include the eﬀects of ne-
maticity and quantum paramagnetism, where multiple spin
ﬂuctuation-mediated pairing channels cooperate.
