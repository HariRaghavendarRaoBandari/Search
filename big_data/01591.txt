Abstract: We investigate the origin and behavior of oscillations observed in the hadron
correlators constructed from the domain wall fermion (DWF) for diﬀerent parameters in-
volved in lattice QCD simulations. This oscillatory behavior at early time slices hinders
the extraction of excited states in hadron spectroscopy. Furthermore, the deviation from
exponential decay may have a signiﬁcant impact on fermion loop calculations performed
on the lattice. We present results for several well-known implementations of the DWF
actions. We extend the study of Shamir DWF action to include Boriçi and Möbius DWF
actions by analyzing the poles of 4D quark propagator. For each action considered, we ﬁnd
an unphysical mode when analyzing the pole structure of the free DWF propagator for a
ﬁnite extent of the 5th dimension Ls, and we show that this mode is responsible for the
oscillatory behavior observed in hadron correlators. We have performed numerical checks
on these results and have found that the presence of oscillatory behavior is sensitive to the
DWF parameters a5, b5, c5 and DW height M. To minimize oscillations, our results suggest
that one should choose M a5 < 1 for the Shamir and Boriçi DWFs, and M (b5 − c5) < 1 for
Möbius DWF when M > 1. For each calculation considered, the Borçi DWF displayed the
smallest magnitude of oscillation when compared to the Shamir and Möbius DWF actions
using the same input parameters.

Formulating lattice fermions with exact chiral symmetry at ﬁnite lattice spacings is a non-
trivial task. One such realization of chiral symmetry is the domain wall fermion (DWF)
on a (4+1)-dimensional lattice [1, 2]. Domain wall fermions have been used in several
collaborations around the world (RBC/UKQCD, LHPC, TWQCD) to perform large-scale
dynamical simulations of lattice QCD due to its good chiral symmetry. In many of these
simulations, however, an unphysical oscillatory mode appears in hadron correlators within
the ﬁrst several time slices. This unphysical mode has been observed when analyzing two
point correlation functions computed on quenched conﬁgurations [3], in DBW2 action [4],
LHPC hybrid action using DW fermions on HYP smeared MILC conﬁgurations [5], domain
wall valence on Asqtad staggered sea conﬁgurations [6], and domain wall valence on domain
wall sea [7]. A numerical analysis performed in [8] has shown that oscillation eﬀects appear
for domain wall heights M > 1 and worsen as M is increased for the Shamir action.

A more recent analysis [11] of the Shamir action has identiﬁed the unphysical mode
responsible for the oscillatory behavior by analyzing the poles of 5D free DWF propagator [2,
12]. They have shown, this unphysical mode acquires an imaginary part iπ when M > 1
and results in oscillatory behavior of the DWF propagator in time.

In this work, we pinpoint the origin of these oscillatory modes for the Shamir, Boriçi,
and Möbius DWF actions [2, 9, 10] by analyzing the poles of 4D quark propagator. We show

– 1 –

that oscillatory eﬀects appear for speciﬁc parameter choices in the free 4D propagator for
each action. We do this both analytically, by computing the tree-level pole terms for each
DWF action, and then conﬁrm our ﬁndings numerically using Chroma [13]. We identify
the pole responsible for the oscillatory behavior and refer to this pole as the unphysical
pole for the rest of this work. For our numerical calculations, we plot the eﬀective mass of
the nucleon as a function of time for each action. The Boriçi DWF exhibits the smallest
observable oscillation in the transfer matrix. We discuss this observation by noting that
the contribution of the 5D unphysical eigenmode of the Boriçi DWF transfer matrix has
minimal coupling to the 4D boundary, and thus has minimal impact on the physical 4D
propagator. We also suggest choices of the parameters a5, b5, c5 for M > 1 to minimize
the oscillations in the hadron correlators.

This paper is organized as follows, an overview of the DWF actions considered as well
as common notation is presented in sec. (2). In secs. (3), (4), (5) we present an analysis
of the Shamir, Boriçi, Möbius DWFs and outline the method we use to extract the pole
terms for each action. In sec. (6), we show the eﬀective mass plots of nucleons computed
from Chroma for each DWF action using diﬀerent sets of values of 5D lattice spacing a5,
b5, c5, domain wall height M and extent of 5th dimension Ls. Finally, we examine the
contributions of the unphysical eigenmodes at the 4D boundary for each DWF action and
discuss why the oscillation in the Boriçi DWF is observed to be weaker than the Shamir
and Möbius DWF case. The detailed analytic formulas for the Boriçi 4D propagators can
be found in Appendix A of the paper.

2 The Domain Wall Fermion

Domain wall fermions preserve ﬂavor symmetry and they have greatly reduced chiral sym-
metry breaking at the expense of adding an extra ﬁfth dimension. The four dimensional
chiral fermions arise on the boundaries of a ﬁve dimesional lattice. In this section we outline
several of the actions used to compute the free tree-level propagator using DWFs. We make
use of the compact notation in [10] by keeping the length of the 5th domain wall dimension

(2.4)

In this section we re-derive several known results for the Shamir DWF action. In particular,
we conﬁrm that when the domain wall height M > 1, the 5D transfer matrix becomes
complex [14] which gives rise to oscillatory behavior in the hadron correlators. We begin
by considering the Shamir DWF operator and take bs = a5 and cs = 0 in eq. (2.2). To
construct 5D Green’s function we follow the method described in [2] and ﬁrst consider the
Dirac operator on an inﬁnite s-direction,

s,s(cid:48) = (a5Dw + 1)δs,s(cid:48) − PLδs,s(cid:48)−1 − PRδs,s(cid:48)+1.

Following [2], we now consider ﬁnite 5th dimension 0 ≤ s ≤ Ls and turn on link
connecting sites s = 0 and s = Ls, therefore two Weyl fermions will now form Dirac
fermions and their mass is now proportional to the strength of the link. With these results
we can now compute the 5D Green’s function for ﬁnite Ls. In what follows, we also scale
a5 = a = 1 in the intermediate steps of the calculation and restore them at the end as was
done in [2, 12, 18] to simplify the manipulations. We follow the conventions in [18], i.e. we
take Ls → Ls − 1, s → s− 1, s(cid:48) → s(cid:48) − 1 and calculate the full 5D Green’s function following
the method in [2, 18],

s,s(cid:48) = A0e−α|s−s(cid:48)| + A∓e−α(s+s(cid:48)−2) + A±e−α(2Ls−s−s(cid:48))

−e−2αLs((1 − b(p)e−α) − m2(1 − b(p)eα))

And we will make use of the usual deﬁnition of the residual mass,

mr = e−αLs

(3.8)

With the above results for the 5D Green’s function, we now project this 5D Green’s function
to 4D at ﬁnite Ls = N following the method described in [17]. By using the fact that for
any DWF action, the physical quark ﬁelds in 4D are deﬁned on the boundaries of the 5th
dimension (s = 1 and s = N),

q(x) = PRψ1(x) + PLψN (x)

(3.9)

Starting with the 5D propagator, we can use the above relations to compute the corre-
sponding 4D propagator,

3.1 Oscillation Eﬀects in the Free Shamir Domain Wall Propagator
It has been shown in [11] that for b(p) = 0 the second order operator Ω0
is a unit
s,s(cid:48) ∝ δs,s(cid:48) and the corresponding modes are
matrix (up to a factor) whose inverse is G0
completely bound to the domain wall and are not responsible for the oscillation in the
temporal direction of the hadron correlators. From our results in the previous section, the
unphysical pole of the propagator in eq. (3.12) can then be computed by solving for p in
the expression,

s,s(cid:48)

or equivalently from eq. (3.3),

sinh α = 0

cosh α(p) =

a2
5p2 + b2(p) + 1

2b(p)

= 1

(3.16)

To solve for p in the above equation, we shall only consider a static mode, pi = 0, p4 (cid:54)= 0 [11].
We then ﬁnd for p4,

M = 1 − cos p4a ∓ i sin p4a
⇒ e±ip4a = 1 − M a

where M = M a deﬁned in eq. (2.4). We then ﬁnd that the energy, E = −ip4,

E = ± 1
a

ln(1 − M a).

(3.17)

(3.18)

For a = 1, E is real for 0 < M < 1. This implies that this static mode propagates forward
or backward in the time direction with the energy E = ln(1−M ). However, in a simulation,
if M > 1

E = ± [ln(M − 1) + iπ]

(3.19)

(−1)t(cid:0)eln(M−1)t + eln(M−1)(T−t)(cid:1), where ln(M − 1) is negative for M > 1. This gives rise

which is complex. This unphysical mode propagates in the time direction as

– 6 –

to oscillatory behavior in hadron correlation functions for Shamir DWF action. Though it
has been argued in [8] that these oscillations are due to the lattice artifacts at cutoﬀ scales
and in [3, 21] that the non-locality of the valence DWF action in four dimensions produces
oscillatory contributions to the two-point eﬀective mass close to the source, this analysis
illustrates that the unphysical pole term in eq. 3.12 gives rise to oscillatory behavior in the
DWF correlators.

4 Boriçi DWF Action

In this section we consider Boriçi’s action and set a = 1 as was done in [10]. The DWF
operator for Boriçi’s action is given by setting,

bs = a5,

cs = a5

for the Dirac operators appearing in eq. (2.2). With these values of bs and cs and following
the calculation in sec. (3) we start with Dirac operator on an inﬁnite s-direction,

s,s(cid:48) = (cid:0)ia5/p + b(p)(cid:1) δs,s(cid:48) +(cid:0)ia5/p + c(p)(cid:1) PLδs,s(cid:48)−1

B(cid:48) = 2(−a2

As before, one can verify through explicit calculation that this form of the inverse does
indeed satisfy, for s = s(cid:48),

[Ω0]s,t[G0]t,s(cid:48) = Is,s(cid:48)

(4.7)

and zero otherwise.

Following the method described in sec. (3) and having computed the 5D Green’s func-
tion for ﬁnite Ls using G0
s,s(cid:48), we calculate the 4D quark propagator by taking a, a5 = 1, for
simpliﬁcation as was done for the Shamir DWF case. The full expression for the 4D propa-
gator can be found in the Appendix A of the paper. Schematically, the 4D propagator can
be written as,

S4D(p) =

−i/pN − b(cid:48)(p)N(cid:48) + m(cid:48)(p)N

B(cid:48)F (cid:48)

N

(cid:48)(cid:48)

(4.8)

With these results then, we identify the B(cid:48) in the denominators in eq. (4.8) or (4.5)
to give rise the unphysical pole in analogy with the Shamir DWF. As was done with the
Shamir DWF case, we extract the pole of the propagator setting pi = 0, and p4 (cid:54)= 0 by
solving the condition,

(4.9)
which results in a condition on E = −ip4 which is the same result as the Shamir DWF,

sinh α(cid:48) = 0

or, cosh α(cid:48) = 1.

E = ± ln(1 − M )

(4.10)

As before it is complex for M > 1 and leads to the oscillatory behavior.

5 Möbius DWF Action

In this section we consider the Möbius DWF operator. The form for the DWF operator on
an inﬁnite s-direction is given by taking a = 1, bs = b5, cs = c5, in eq. (2.2),

where,

s,s(cid:48) = (b5(i/p + b(p)) + 1)δs,s(cid:48) + (c5(i/p + b(p)) − 1)

We ﬁnd for Ω0 for the Möbius DWF,

A calculation similar to the Shamir and Boriçi DWFs can be done to calculate the 4D quark
propagator and one can show the unphysical pole is present analogous to Shamir and Boriçi
4D quark propagators. Solving for sinh α

= 0 or equivalently cosh α

which is again complex for M > 1 analogous to what we obtained for Shamir and Boriçi
DWFs.

6 Numerical Results of Oscillatory Behavior

In this section we compute hadron eﬀective mass meﬀ, and plot meﬀ for the proton as
a function of time for various DWFs. We use Chroma [13] to construct various DWF
correlators on free 243 × 64 conﬁgurations for diﬀerent values of a5, b5, c5, M and Ls. We
also consider conﬁgurations where the links have been replaced by their vacuum expectation
value u0 [19]. We have used the standard deﬁnition of the eﬀective mass in our plots,

meﬀ = log

C(t)

C(t + 1)

,

(6.1)

where C(t) is the hadron correlator. Figure 1 illustrates the oscillatory behavior at short
time slices in the eﬀective mass plots when M = 1.8, m = 0.005, a5 = 1, u0 = 1, Ls = 16
for the free Shamir, Boriçi DWFs and b5 = 1.5, c5 = 0.5 for the Möbius DWFs in agreement
with our analytic conditions.

We also verify numerically, as discussed in [14], that the oscillatory behavior reduces
if M a5 < 1 and M (b5 − a5) < 1 in Figure 2 by keeping all other

a lot if a5 ≤ 0.5, i.e.
parameters the same as previous plot.

An important observation to be made from from Figure 1 and Figure 2 is that the

expected exponential decay compared to Shamir and Möbius DWFs. We also point out
that the eﬀective mass plot remains the same for a5 = 1 and a5 = 0.5 for the Boriçi DWF
in Figure 2 We see that the eﬀective mass plot is rather insensitive to change in a5 for the
Boriçi DWF.

However, we notice from Figure 1 that the plateau of the eﬀective mass plot of the

– 10 –

Möbius DWF does not coincide with those of Shamir and Boriçi DWF. We see, if we
increase Ls from Ls = 16 to Ls = 32, all the plateaus coincide in the eﬀective mass plots
as shown in Figure 3 for Ls = 32.

Figure 3. mef f plot for Möbius DWF. M = 1.8, m = 0.005, b5−c5 = 1.0, u0 = 1.0, Ls = 16, 32, 48.

Similar eﬀective mass plots for diﬀerent values of Ls for Shamir and Boriçi DWFs can
be found in Appendix B. It is interesting to notice from Figure 3 (also from Figures 8, 9)
that the feature of oscillation in the eﬀective mass plots remains same if one increases Ls
gradually from Ls = 16 to Ls = 48. This is consistent with the results in Table 2 that the
unphysical pole disappears from the theory only when Ls → ∞.

We now compare the eﬀective mass plots for diﬀerent values of M = 1.1, 1.2, ...., 1.8.
From Figure 4 we see that at earlier time slices the value of log(C(t)/C(t+1)) increases as M
increases for Shamir DWF. From Figure 5, we notice at t = 1, the value of log(C(t)/C(t+1))
decreases as M increases for Boriçi DWF. A similar graph for Möbius DWF has been
presented in Appendix B (Figure 10). We note that the variation of the log(C(t)/C(t + 1))
curves as a function of M for Boriçi DWF is much smaller than both the Shamir (Figure 4)
as well as the Möbius DWF (Figure 10). This indicates that the extraction of excited states
might be very sensitive to the values of M when Shamir and Möbius DWFs are used for
numerical simulation.

We next consider the case where the fermion ﬁelds are coupled to a mean gauge ﬁeld.
Here, the links are replaced by their vacuum expectation value, u0. We choose average
plaquette value P = 0.58813 [20]. The mean ﬁeld value of domain wall height is

(6.2)
Then for M = 1.8 the value of M M F ≈ 1.302. P = 0.58813 corresponds to a mean ﬁeld
u0 ≈ 0.85 according to [18]. According to the discussion in [11], we observe the oscillations

Boriçi DWF is nearly absent. The numerical simulations show clear evidence that Boriçi’s
DWF exhibits minimal deviation from exponential decay at early time slices. However the
tree level expressions for the unphysical pole are identical for every DWF action considered.
To explain this fact, we consider the eigenmode expansion of the DWF propagator near the
static mode (where pi = 0, and p4 (cid:54)= 0). The poles of (Ω0
s,s(cid:48))−1 correspond to the solution

numerically that the Boriçi DWF has the least amount of oscillation during early time
slices.

As discussed in [11], if the contribution of the 5D unphysical eigenmode vanishes at the
4D boundary, oscillating behavior impacting 4D physics will vanish also. We illustrate this
by plotting components of the zero-mode eigenvector for a value of p4 corresponding to the
unphysical pole (see eq. (6.3)) in Figure 7 We have taken M = 1.3, m = 0.001, a5 = 1.0,
b5 = 1.5, c5 = 0.5 as parameters for the DWF transfer matrix. We observe that the s = 1
and s = 16 components of this eigenvector of the Boriçi DWF nearly vanish compared
to the Shamir and Möbius DWFs, and therefore have minimal coupling to 4D physics.
Eqs. (3.9)-(3.10) illustrate that the 4D propagator is the chiral projection of a product of
q(x) and the 5D wave function ψ (s=1 or s=N). Therefore if the s = N component of
ψ due to the unphysical mode nearly vanishes at the 4D boundary, then the unphysical
modes have minimal coupling to the 4D physics. This analysis is in good agreement with
our earlier mef f plots where we found the Boriçi DWF exhibits negligible oscillation in the
hadron correlators as compared to the Shamir and Möbius DWF formalisms.

7 Conclusions

In this work, we have provided a detailed analysis of the pole structure of the free propagator
for the Shamir, Boriçi, and Möbius DWF actions. By investigating the poles we have
provided a qualitative picture of the origin of oscillatory behavior in the eﬀective mass
plots when using DWFs and have quoted restrictions on the values of the product M a5 < 1

– 14 –

(Shamir, Boriçi), M (b5 − c5) < 1 (Möbius) needed to ensure such oscillatory behavior is
very small or absent for M > 1. We have also pointed out that the Boriçi DWF correlators
are insensitive to the change of values of a5. We have shown for free case that at earlier
time log(C(t)/C(t + 1)) curves for Shamir and Möbius DWFs depend signiﬁcantly on the
values of M. Therefore one needs to ﬁnd out a value of M such that extraction of hadron
excited states produces the correct result.

In all cases, we observe that the Boriçi DWF has far less oscillatory eﬀects at early
time slices as compared to the other DWF actions we consider. We have argued why this is
so by considering the contribution of unphysical eigenmodes on the 4D boundary of Boriçi
DWF. We have shown that these eigenmodes are suppressed on the 4D boundary by a larger
amount compared to Shamir and Möbius actions, which corresponds to smaller oscillatory
eﬀects contaminating the 4D physics of interest.

We have commented that the eﬀects of the unphysical pole cannot be removed from
the transfer matrix when realistic simulations are performed at a ﬁnite Ls. Because of
this, the unphysical mode can have a signiﬁcant impact on any fermion loop calculation
when DWFs are employed. We close this section with the remark that even though this
analysis represents a non-interacting analysis of the DWF pole structure, we expect similar
qualitative features to be present in fully interacting calculations.
