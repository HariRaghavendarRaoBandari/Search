ABSTRACT

Context. Classical Supergiant X-ray Binaries (SGXBs) and Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXTs) are two types of High-mass
X-ray Binaries (HMXBs) that present similar donors but, at the same time, show very different behavior in the X-rays. The reason
for this dichotomy of wind-fed HMXBs is still a matter of debate. Among the several explanations that have been proposed, some of
them invoke speciﬁc stellar wind properties of the donor stars. Only dedicated empiric analysis of the donors’ stellar wind can provide
the required information to accomplish an adequate test of these theories. However, such analyses are scarce.
Aims. To close this gap, we perform a comparative analysis of the optical companion in two important systems: IGR J17544-2619
(SFXT) and Vela X-1 (SGXB). We analyse the spectra of each star in detail and derive their stellar and wind properties. As a next
step, we compare the wind parameters, giving us an excellent chance of recognizing key differences between donor winds in SFXTs
and SGXBs.
Methods. We use archival infrared, optical and ultraviolet observations, and analyse them with the non-LTE Potsdam Wolf-Rayet
model atmosphere code. We derive the physical properties of the stars and their stellar winds, accounting for the inﬂuence of X-rays
on the stellar winds.
Results. We ﬁnd that the stellar parameters derived from the analysis generally agree well with the spectral types of the two donors:
O9I (IGR J17544-2619) and B0.5Iae (Vela X-1). The distance to the sources have been revised and also agrees well with the esti-
mations already available in the literature. In IGR J17544-2619 we are able to narrow the uncertainty to d = 3.0 ± 0.2 kpc. From
the stellar radius of the donor and its X-ray behavior, the eccentricity of IGR J17544-2619 is constrained to e < 0.25. The derived
chemical abundances point to certain mixing during the lifetime of the donors. An important difference between the stellar winds of

the two stars is their terminal velocities (∞
consequences on the X-ray luminosity of these sources.
Conclusions. The donors of IGR J17544-2619 and Vela X-1 have similar spectral types as well as similar parameters that physically
characterise them and their spectra. In addition, the orbital parameters of the systems are similar too, with a nearly circular orbit
and short orbital period. However, they show moderate differences in their stellar wind velocity and spin period of their neutron
stars that have a strong impact on the X-ray luminosity of the sources. This speciﬁc combination of wind speed and pulsar spin
favours an accretion regime with a persistently high luminosity in Vela X-1, while it favours an inhibiting accretion mechanism in
IGR J17544-2619. Our study demonstrates that the wind relative velocity is critical in the determination of the class of HMXBs
hosting a supergiant donor, given that it may shift the accretion mechanism from direct accretion to propeller regimes when combined
with other parameters.

1. Introduction

Within the wide zoo of High-mass X-ray Binaries (HMXBs),
we ﬁnd two classes of sources where a compact object, usu-
ally a neutron star, accretes matter from the stellar wind of
a supergiant OB donor. These are the classical Supergiant
X-ray Binaries (SGXBs) and the Supergiant Fast X-ray Tran-
sients (SFXTs). These two groups of systems, despite hosting

roughly the same type of stars, have distinctive properties when
observed in the X-rays.

Supergiant X-ray Binaries are persistent sources, with an
X-ray luminosity in the range LX ∼ 1033−39 erg/s. They are
often variable, showing ﬂares and off-states that
indicate
abrupt changes in the accretion rate (Kreykenbohm et al. 2008;
Martínez-Núñez et al. 2014). However, their variability is not
as extreme as in SFXTs (Walter & Zurita Heras 2007). The

dynamic range (ratio between luminosity in outburst and in
quiescence) in SGXBs is . 2 orders of magnitude. In contrast,
the dynamic range in SFXTs can reach up to six orders of
magnitude in the most extreme cases such as IGR J17544-
2619 (Romano et al. 2015; in’t Zand 2005), analysed in this
work. During quiescence, SFXTs exhibit a low X-ray lumi-
nosity of LX ∼ 1032 erg/s (in’t Zand 2005), but they spend
most of their time in an intermediate level of emission of
∼ 1033−34 erg/s (Sidoli et al. 2008). They display short outbursts
(∼few hours), reaching luminosities up to 1036−37 erg/s (Sidoli
2011; Sidoli et al. 2009).

There are other sources in between SGXBs and SFXTs, the
so called "intermediate SFXTs", which have a dynamic range
of & 2 orders of magnitude. Hence, there is no sharp border
that clearly separates SGXBs and SFXTs. The categorization
of SFXTs as a new class of HMXBs (Negueruela et al. 2006)
was possible thanks to INTEGRAL observations (Sguera et al.
2005). Since then, several explanations have been proposed in
order to explain their transient behavior.

Negueruela et al. (2008) suggested that the intrinsic clumpiness
of the wind of hot supergiant donors, together with different
orbital conﬁgurations, may explain the different dynamic ranges
between SGXBs and SFXTs. If the eccentricity of SFXTs is
high enough, the compact object swings between dense regions
with a high probability of accreting a wind clump and ﬂare up,
and diffuse regions where this probability is low and the source
is consequently faint in the X-rays. In SGXBs, the compact
object would orbit in a closer and more circular trajectory,
accreting matter incessantly. However, the short orbital period
of some SFXTs is contradictory with this scheme (Walter et al.
2015).

Other ingredients, such as the magnetic ﬁeld of the neutron star
and/or the the spin period, might be important. This is supported
by the monitoring of SFXTs. Tracing SFXTs for a long period,
Lutovinov et al. (2013) conclude that, in SFXTs, the accretion
is notably inhibited most of the time. One can invoke to the
different possible conﬁgurations of accretion, co-rotation and
magnetospheric radius in order to relax the extremely sharp
density contrast required in the above mentioned interpretation
(Grebenev & Sunyaev 2007; Bozzo et al. 2008; Grebenev
2010). The size of these radii depend on the wind, orbital, and
neutron star parameters. For instance, if the magnetospheric
radius is larger than the accretion radius (Bondi 1952), the
inﬂow of matter is signiﬁcantly inhibited by a magnetic barrier,
resulting in a relatively low X-ray emission from the source.
Under this interpretation, the physical conditions in SFXTs
make them prone to regime transitions as a response to relatively
modest variations in the wind properties of the donor, which
cause abrupt changes in X-ray luminosity.

These changes might also be explained within the theory of
quasi-spherical accretion onto slowly rotating magnetized
neutron stars developed by Shakura et al. (2012). This theory
describes the so-called subsonic settling accretion regime in
detail. In slowly rotating neutron stars,
the penetration of
matter into the magnetosphere is driven predominantly by
Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities (Elsner & Lamb 1976). When the
cooling of the plasma in the boundary of the magnetosphere
is not sufﬁciently efﬁcient, the accretion of matter is highly
inhibited and consequently the X-ray luminosity is low. On
the other hand, when the cooling time is much smaller than

Article number, page 2 of 26

the characteristic free-fall time (tcool ≪ tﬀ), the instability
conditions are fulﬁlled and the plasma easily enters the magne-
tosphere, triggering high X-ray luminosity. The last is achieved
when the X-ray luminosity is LX & 4 · 1036 erg/s, and the rapid
Compton cooling dominates over the radiative cooling. For the
brightest ﬂares (LX > 1036), Shakura et al. (2014) proposed
that a magnetized wind of the donor might induce magnetic
reconnection, enhancing the accretion up to the critical X-ray
luminosity and triggering the suction of the whole shell by the
neutron star.

We need as much information as possible about the stellar
wind conditions in order to understand the different behavior of
SGXBs and SFXTs. However, very few analyses of SGXBs and
SFXTs have been performed so far in the ultraviolet-optical-
infrared spectral range using modern atmosphere codes which
include NLTE and line blanketing effects. Moreover, although
the X-rays are mainly produced in the surroundings of the
compact object, the analysis of X-rays observations is directly
affected by the physical properties of the donor and its wind. For
instance, the assumed abundances strongly affect the derived
value of one of the most important parameters in the X-rays
studies: the equivalent hydrogen column density (NH). More
reliable abundances make the NH estimations more reliable.
Analysing spectra by means of line-blanked, NLTE model
atmosphere codes is currently the best way to extract the stellar
parameters of hot stars with winds.

In this work we analyze the optical companion of two X-ray
sources: IGR J17544-2619 (SFXT) and Vela X-1 (SGXB).
These sources are usually considered to be prototypical for their
respective classes (Martínez-Núñez et al. 2014; Sidoli et al.
2009; Mauche et al. 2007). Hence, in addition to the important
scientiﬁc value of studying these sources by themselves, this is
an excellent opportunity to compare the donor’s parameters in
these two prototypical systems, and to test how well the afore-
mentioned resolutions for the SFXT puzzle ﬁt in with our results.

The structure of the paper is as follows. In Sect. 2 we describe the
set of observations used in this work. In Sect. 3 we explain the
main features of Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) code employed in
the ﬁts. In Sect. 4 we detail the ﬁt process and give the obtained
results. In Sect. 5 we discuss several consequences arising from
our results. Finally, in Sect. 6 we enumerate the conclusions that
we ﬁnd from this work.

2. The observations
In this study we used data from International Ultravio-
the ﬁber-fed extended range optical
let Explorer
spectrograph (FEROS)2 operated at
the European Southern
Observatory (ESO) in La Silla, Chile; and the infrared (IR)
spectrograph SpeX in the NASA Infrared Telescope Facil-
ity (IRTF) in Mauna Kea, Hawaii.

(IUE)1,

The IUE is provided with two spectrographs (long-wavelength in
the range 1850−3300 Å and short- wavelength in 1150−2000 Å)
and four cameras (prime and redundant camera, for each spec-
trograph). Each spectrograph can be used with either large
aperture (a slot 10x20 arcsec), or small aperture (a circle
3 arcsec diameter). In addition, each spectrograph has two

dispersion modes: high resolution and low resolution. High
resolution mode (∼ 0.2 Å) utilizes an echelle grating plus a
cross-disperser. Low resolution mode (∼ 6 Å) utilizes only the
cross-disperser. IUE provides ﬂux calibrated data. This is an
important advantage due to two main reasons: ﬁrst, we used
these observations to ﬁt the spectral energy distribution from the
models, as explained below in Sect. 4.2; and second, we did not
have to normalize the UV spectrum. As we can see in Fig. B.3
and 10, it is not straightforward to see the actual ﬂux level of the
UV continuum, since this spectral range is almost completely
covered by spectral
lines. Therefore, any normalization by
visual inspection would lead to signiﬁcant errors. Instead, we
rectiﬁed the IUE spectra using the PoWR model continuum.

FEROS is a spectrograph that yields high resolution echelle
spectroscopy (R ∼ 48000) and high efﬁciency (∼ 20%) in the
optical wavelength range (3600 − 9200 Å) (Kaufer et al. 1999).
SpeX is an infrared spectrograph in the 0.8 − 5.5 µm range.
Among the different modes available in this instrument, we used
the 0.8 − 2.4 µm cross-dispersed mode (SXD), which yields
moderate spectral resolution (R ∼ 2000) (Rayner et al. 2003).
In Table 1 we present the set of observations of IGR J17544-
2619. We used an observation from SpeX taken on Au-
gust 8, 2004. In the ESO archive there are 14 FEROS
observations of IGR J17544-2619 taken on four different dates
during September 2005. There are not IUE available public
observations of IGR J17544-2619.

In Table 2 we present the set of observations of Vela X-1. In
the ESO archive there are six consecutive FEROS observations
of 700s taken on April 22, 2006. For the IUE data, we used
the high dispersion and large aperture observations using the
short-wavelength spectrograph (1150-2000 Å) and the prime
camera (SWP). There are 49 observations in the public database
of the IUE following these criteria.

For each instrument, we averaged over all the available observa-
tions taking into account the exposure time in order to improve
the signal-to-noise ratio. We did not take the variability of the
UV spectral lines depending on the orbital phase into account,
that has been reported for Vela X-1 (Sadakane et al. 1985).
The variability consists on the presence of an extra absorption
component in several spectral lines, specially ones belonging
to Al III and Fe III , mainly at phases φ > 0.5. This variability
must be taken into account to interpret the full picture of the
stellar wind of Vela X-1. However, in this work, we prioritized
a signal-to-noise ratio as high as possible over ﬁtting a number
of phase dependent spectra with signiﬁcantly lower signal-
to-noise. This permits us to estimate the stellar parameters
of Vela X-1 more accurately, while not affecting any of the
conclusions derived in this work, as we have carefully examined.

3. The PoWR code

PoWR computes models of hot stellar atmospheres assuming
spherical symmetry and stationary outﬂow. The non-LTE pop-
ulation numbers are calculated using the equations of statistical
equilibrium and radiative transfer in the co-moving frame.
Since these equations are coupled, the solution is iteratively
found. Once convergence is reached, the synthetic spectrum is
calculated integrating along the emergent radiation rays. The

⋆R2

The basic input parameters in PoWR are the following: stellar
temperature (T⋆), luminosity (L⋆), mass-loss rate ( ˙M), surface
gravity (g⋆) and chemical abundances. The chemical elements
taken into account are detailed in Table 4. The stellar radius
(R⋆) follows from T⋆ and L⋆ using the Stefan-Boltzmann law:
L⋆ = 4πσT 4
⋆, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. We
note that, in PoWR, R⋆ refers to the layer where the Rosseland
continuum optical depth τmax = 20, and not to the deﬁnition
of stellar radius (or photospheric radius), where τRoss = 2/3.
Nevertheless, we will give the stellar parameters in the next
sections referring to both τmax = 20 and the τmax = 2/3, in
order to avoid any confusion (e.g., we will use R⋆ for the
radius at τmax = 20 and R2/3 for the radius at τmax = 2/3).
The surface gravity g⋆ and R⋆ imply the stellar mass (M⋆) via
g⋆ = GM⋆R−2
⋆ . Instead of g⋆, one may specify the effective
surface gravity geff, which accurately accounts for the outward
force exerted by the radiation ﬁeld, as thoroughly described by
Sander et al. (2015).

The density stratiﬁcation in the stellar atmosphere, ρ(r), is cal-
culated from the continuity equation ˙M = 4πr2(r)ρ(r), given ˙M
and the radial velocity stratiﬁcation (r). For (r), PoWR distin-
guish between two different regimes: the quasi-hydrostatic do-
main and the wind domain. A detailed description of the quasi-
hydrostatic domain can be found in Sander et al. (2015). In the
wind domain, the β-law is adopted (Castor et al. 1975):

r0
r (cid:19)β

(1)

(r) = ∞ (cid:18)1 −
where ∞
is the terminal velocity of the wind, r0 ≈ R⋆ (de-
pending on the precise location of the connection point) and β
is an input parameter typically ranging between β = 0.6 − 2.0
(Puls et al. 2008). The connection point is chosen in order
to ensure a smooth transition between the two domains. The
temperature stratiﬁcation is calculated from the condition of
radiative equilibrium (Hamann & Gräfener 2003).

The code also permits to account for density inhomogeneities
and additional X-rays from a spherically-symmetric, shock
heated plasma. Density inhomogeneities are described in PoWR
by means of an optional radial-dependent input parameter: the
density contrast D(r) = ρcl/ ¯ρ, where ρcl is the density of the
clumped medium and ¯ρ is the average density. The inter-clump
medium is assumed to be empty. During the analysis, D(r)
is assumed to grow from D(rsonic) = 1 (smooth plasma) to a
maximum value D, which is reached at the layer where the
. D is a free parameters derived
stellar wind velocity is fmax × ∞
in the analysis. fmax has a modest inﬂuence on the spectra. We
assumed fmax ∼ 0.6 on the basis of this moderate effect. The
X-rays are described using three parameters: the X-ray temper-
ature TX, the ﬁlling factor XF (i.e. the ratio between shocked
to unshocked plasma), and the onset radius RX, as described
in Baum et al. (1992). In this work, we assumed TX = 107 K,
RX = 1.2 R⋆ and XF = 0.05. The main inﬂuence of X-rays in
the model is via Auger ionization, which is responsible for the
appearance of resonance lines belonging to high ions such as
NV and OVI in the spectra of O stars (Cassinelli & Olson 1979;
Krtiˇcka & Kubát 2009; Oskinova et al. 2011). Any changes in
these parameters barely affect the spectrum, as long as they they
produce a similar X-ray luminosity.

During the iterative calculation of the population numbers, the
spectral lines are taken to be Gaussian with a constant Doppler
width of Dop = 40 km/s; the effect of Dop on the spectrum is
negligible for most lines (see discussion by Shenar et al. 2015).
During the formal integration, the line proﬁles include natural
broadening, pressure broadening, and Doppler broadening. The
Doppler width is decomposed per element to a depth dependent
thermal motion and a microturbulent velocity ξ(r). The photo-
spheric microturbulence, ξph, is derived in the analysis, and be-
yond the photosphere we assumed that it grows from ξ = ξph
to ξ = 100 km/s at the layer where the stellar wind velocity
is 500 km/s. Rotational broadening is simulated via convolu-
tion with rotational proﬁles with a width corresponding to the
projected rotational velocity rot sin i (denoted by rot hereafter
for simplicity), except for important wind lines, for which the
convolution is no longer valid (see e.g. Hillier et al. 2012), and
where an explicit angle-integration would be required (as de-
scribed by Shenar et al. 2014). The so-called macroturbulence
mac is accounted for by convolving the spectra with so-called
Radial-Tangential proﬁles (Gray 1975; Simón-Díaz & Herrero
2007).

4. The ﬁtting procedure
We used the PoWR code to calculate synthetic spectra and a
Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) which best match the ob-
servations. The large number of free parameters, together with
the long computation time for each model, do not permit the
construction of a grid of models that covers the full parameter
space. Instead, we attempted to identify the best-ﬁtting model
by visual inspection and systematic variation of the parameters.
As an initial step, we calculate models using typical parameters
of late O / early B stars. We then use speciﬁc spectral lines
for each parameter as a guideline for the ﬁt. Generally, the
effective gravity geff is derived from the pressure-broadened
wings of the Balmer lines and He II lines. The temperature T⋆
is derived based on line ratios belonging to different ions of
the same element. The mass-loss rate ˙M, ∞
and D are derived
from "wind-lines", with D adjusted so that a simultaneous
ﬁt is obtained for both resonance lines (which scale as ρ)

and recombination lines such as Hα (which scale as ρ2). The
luminosity L⋆ and the reddening EB−V are derived by ﬁtting
the SED to photometry and ﬂux-calibrated spectra. We apply
the reddening law by Fitzpatrick (1999). Abundances are
estimated from the overall strengths of the spectral lines. The
photospheric microturbulence ξph is found from the strength and
shape of helium lines. Finally, the parameters β, rot and mac
are adopted on the basis of the shape and depth of the spectral
lines, together with previous estimations found in the literature,
when available. Upon adjusting the model, the whole spectral
domain was examined to iteratively improve the ﬁt. Overall,
we managed to ﬁnd models which satisfactorily reproduce the
observed spectra and SEDs of the donors of the two systems
analysed here.

We show the complete ﬁts in Appendix B. The details about the
ﬁtting procedure for the two objects are given in the following
subsections. The obtained parameters are summarised in Table 3
and the chemical abundances in Table 4. The parameters that
do not include an error estimation in the tables are adopted
following the above mentioned criteria.

Even though the optical companion in Vela X-1 is usually
known as HD 77581, for the sake of simplicity we will refer to
the donors with the name that is used for the X-rays sources,
namely, IGR J17544-2619 and Vela X-1. Depending on the
context, the reader should easily recognize whether it is the
donor or the X-ray source which is being referred to.

4.1. IGR J17544-2619

IGR J17544-2619 was ﬁrst detected on September 2003 with
the IBIS/ISGRI detector on board INTEGRAL (Sunyaev et al.
2003). It is located in the direction of the galactic center,
at galactic coordinates l = 3.24◦, b = −0.34◦. The orbital

period is ∼4.9d (Clark et al. 2009). According to Chandra
observations, the compact object is a neutron star (in’t Zand
2005). Pellizza et al. (2006) used optical and NIR observations
in order to classify the optical companion as a O9Ib. Chandra
and Swift observations showed that the system exhibits a high
dynamic range in its X-ray variability, changing the X-ray ﬂux
by 5 orders of magnitude (in’t Zand 2005; Romano et al. 2015).

Nowadays, the spin period Pspin of the hypothetical neutron
star in IGR J17544-2619 is a matter of debate, given the
results arising from observations taken at different
times,
different luminosities and different
instruments. Drave et al.
(2012) analysed RXTE data of the source at intermediate X-ray
luminosity (∼ 1033−34 erg/s), and reported the detection of an
X-ray pulsation with Pspin = 71.49s at a statistical signiﬁcance
of 4.37σ. Romano et al. (2015) inspected Swift observations
of the source experiencing an extraordinarily bright outburst
(peak luminosity ∼ 1038 erg/s), and reported the detection of
X-ray pulsations with Pspin = 11.60s at a statistical signiﬁcance
of about 4σ too. However, these results contrast with the
analyses of XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations performed
by Drave et al. (2014) and Bhalerao et al. (2015) respectively.
These authors do not ﬁnd any evidence of pulsations on time
scales of 1-2000s.

We have adjusted T⋆ of IGR J17544-2619 using different ions,
mainly He I-He II and Si III-Si IV. In Fig. 1 we show an exam-
ple of four helium lines of which the best-ﬁt model provides a
good description. Higher (lower) temperatures yield more (less)
absorption than observed in the He II lines. We have used other
lines of helium, silicon, nitrogen and oxygen. The vast majority
of them are well described by the best-ﬁt model, within the er-
rors. The obtained effective temperature is compatible with the
donor’s spectral class O9 Ib (Martins et al. 2005).

The effective gravity geff was found using the hydrogen Balmer
lines Hγ and Hδ. We did not use Hβ and Hα because these lines
are notably affected by the stellar wind. Figure 2 shows a com-
parison of the observations with the best-ﬁtting model for these
two Balmer lines. We show that the observations are compatible
with a relatively wide range of values, as also reﬂected in the er-

rors given in Table 3.

The distance to IGR J17544-2619 is not well known, with an
estimate of 2-4 kpc Pellizza et al. (2006), based on the extinction
and the calibration of the absolute magnitude for O9Ib stars. In
this work we improve this estimation. As a ﬁrst step, we ﬁtted
the SED to photometry from the 2MASS catalogue (Cutri et al.
2003), Zacharias et al.
(2012) and Rahoui & Chaty (2008)
assuming the distance to be 3 kpc. Then, we derived initial
values for the luminosity of the donor and the reddening to the
system.

As a second step, in order to provide more constraints on the
distance, we employed a method based on the well constrained
luminosity of Red Clump Giant stars (RCG). These stars can
be isolated in a NIR colour-magnitude diagram and permit
the estimation of the interstellar extinction along the line
of sight (López-Corredoira et al. 2002). Due to their narrow
luminosity function, the apparent magnitude of RCGs provides
an estimation of the distance. Then, given a certain line of
sight, a diagram of the extinction versus the distance can be
derived (for more details see González-Fernández et al. 2014).
For IGR J17544-2619 we employed the derived EJ−K from the
SED ﬁt to obtain an estimate of the distance. We note that this

method is only applicable to stars in the direction of the galactic
center like IGR J17544-2619, where the medium is more
homogeneous and the density of RCGs is higher. Using this
method, we obtain a distance of 3.0 ± 0.2 kpc (Fig. 3). Revised
values for the luminosity and reddening are then derived. The
ﬁnal results of the SED ﬁt are shown in Fig. 4.

From the luminosity and temperature we derive R⋆, which
provides an upper limit to the eccentricity of the system. For the
lower limit R⋆ = 17 R

ties, periodic Roche-lobe overﬂow is expected from the orbital
solution of the system (Clark et al. 2009), at odds with the X-ray
behavior of the source. Given the radius of the source and the

emission for HeI λ10833 Å. We choose the best description of
Hα as the best-ﬁt because it provides a better ﬁt to the overall
spectrum. We note that the optical and infrared spectra were not
taken at the same time, and therefore any kind of variability in
the lines might produce a disagreement. However, Hα does not
show such a large variability within the observations we have
analysed (see Fig. 7).

Without available resonance scattering lines in the observations
at hand, we cannot compare P-Cygni lines with recombination
lines to deduce the clumping factor D. However, our calcula-
tions show that changing ˙M dramatically affects the absorption
spectrum in a fashion which is not related to the product ˙M √D.
An example is shown in Fig. 8, where we show three models
˙M and D, but with a ﬁxed
calculated with different values of
˙M √D. Evidently, while the emission exhibited by the
product
wings of H-α (shown in Fig. 8) is similar in all models, the ab-
sorption lines are strongly affected in a non-trivial manner. The
reason for this unexpected behaviour is that many of the strong

lines in the spectrum (e.g. the Balmer series) are formed signif-
icantly beyond the photosphere (τRoss ≈ 2/3), where the mass-
loss rate already strongly affects the density stratiﬁcation via the
continuity equation. Exploiting this effect, we ﬁnd that D ≈ 4
provides the best results for the overall spectrum. However, we
warn that further observations are needed to better constrain the
clumping factor in this star. Nevertheless, we note that our ﬁnal
conclusions do not strongly depend on this factor and the im-
plied mass-loss rate, as will be discussed in Section 5.

The chemical composition was estimated from unblended
spectral lines for He, C, N, O and Si. The rest of the considered
element abundances (see Table 4) were assumed solar following
Asplund et al. (2009). The ﬁt yielded moderate overabundance
of He and N, together with underabundance of C and O. In all,
there are indications of chemical evolution in the outer layers of
the stellar atmosphere.

The rot and mac were roughly estimated using the width of the
He lines. The derived projected rotational velocity is around
0.3 times the critical rotation velocity (crit = qG M⋆R−1
⋆ ). This
high rotational velocity may favour the chemical mixing, in line
with the abundances derived in the ﬁt.

To summarise, our NLTE analysis of optical and near IR spectra
of IGR J17544-2619 showed that the optical O9I-type compan-
ion in this source is not peculiar and has stellar and wind param-
eters that are similar to other stars of the same spectral type, e.g.
δ Ori (Shenar et al. 2015).

4.2. Vela X-1

Vela X-1 is one of the most studied HMXBs, since it is a
bright source discovered in the early ages of the X-ray astron-
omy (Chodil et al. 1967). It is located at galactic coordinates
l = 263.06◦, b = 3.93◦. The distance was estimated to be
1.9 ± 0.2 kpc by (Sadakane et al. 1985). The system has a
moderate eccentricity of e = 0.09 (Bildsten et al. 1997), and
orbital period Porb = 8.96 days (Kreykenbohm et al. 2008). The
compact object is a neutron star that pulsates with Pspin = 283s
(McClintock et al. 1976). The optical companion HD 77581
(B0.5Iae) was identiﬁed by Vidal et al. (1973).

It is very likely that the wind of Vela X-1 is disturbed by
the X-ray source. The photoionization produced close to the
photosphere due to the intense X-ray luminosity might hinder
the acceleration of the wind and generate a structure known
as photoionization wake (Blondin et al. 1990; Krtiˇcka et al.
2015). This structure appears in the UV spectra as an additional
absorption component at phases larger than φ ∼ 0.5 (Kaper et al.
1994). In addition, the hard X-rays light curves of the source in
near-to-eclipse phases show asymmetries between ingress and
egress, that have been interpreted as caused by the existence of
this type of structure trailing the neutron star (Feldmeier et al.
1996). Moreover, a density enhancement in the line of sight

We derived T⋆ following the same procedure that we used for
IGR J17544-2619. The obtained T2/3 is similar to previous
estimations: Sadakane et al. (1985) used the equivalent width
(EW) of photospheric lines to estimate the effective temperature
T2/3 = 25000 K; Fraser et al. (2010) used the TLUSTY code to
estimate T2/3 = 26500 K.

For the ﬁt of the SED, we used photometry from the 2MASS
catalogue (Cutri et al. 2003) and the Stellar Photometry in
Johnson’s 11-color system (Ducati 2002), together with the
IUE observations. We made an estimation of the reddening,
distance and RV ≡ A(V)/EB−V by means of the SED ﬁt. Then,

we used the estimation of the stellar radius R2/3 = 31 R
Joss & Rappaport (1984), and T2/3 from the successive ﬁts, in
order to derive the luminosity (and the distance estimation) from
the Stefan-Boltzmann law. Given that the obtained T2/3 is very
similar to previous estimations, the derived distance of 2.0 ± 0.2
is almost equal to the value d=1.9 kpc given by Sadakane et al.
(1985). We show the results of the SED analysis in Fig. 10.

The estimation of geff was especially delicate in Vela X-1
because of its very low geff. A higher value beyond the error
given in Table 3 has a strong effect in the overall spectrum and
hinders a satisfying ﬁt. The derived value enables a good ﬁt, and
it is in agreement with previous estimations (Fraser et al. 2010).

pact of the X-rays in the stellar wind by Dupree et al. (1980). As
we can see in Fig. 12, when we introduce X-rays in the models
we are able to reproduce C IV without needing a high velocity,
due to the signiﬁcant enhancement of the population of C IV in
the wind. We note that the X-ray radiation we are introducing
in the models is an intrinsic radiation of the donor wind that is
presumably produced in the shocks within the stellar wind it-
self (e.g. Krtiˇcka et al. 2009). This radiation is not coming from
the neutron star, since the effects are also noticeable at eclipsing
phases. The impact of the X-rays coming from the neutron star
is a different and complex issue, and it has been already studied
by other authors (Watanabe et al. 2006). Regarding the Si IV res-
onance lines, in Fig. 12 we show that high stellar wind velocities
as derived by Dupree et al. (1980) do not ﬁt, neither using the
total averaged spectrum, neither using the eclipsing phases spec-
trum.
The value ˙M √D was estimated using Hα (see Fig. 13). We did
not ﬁnd a good ﬁt of the blue wing of the line, observed in ab-
sorption, but our model properly ﬁts the emission in the red wing
of the spectral line. Unfortunately, we do not have more optical
observations covering further orbital phases in order to check
whether Hα is variable. Nevertheless, previous studies of similar
sources demonstrate that this might be the case: González-Galán
(2015) reported the variability of Hα in the very similar B0Iaep
optical companion in the SGXB system XTE J1855-026. More-
over, the shape of Hα in XTE J1855-026 at φ = 0 (see Fig. 5.12
in González-Galán 2015), when the neutron star is hidden behind
the optical counterpart, is strongly reminiscent of the shape that
our model reproduces in Fig. 13. Hence, the relative disagree-
ment between our best-ﬁt model and our observation of Vela X-1
(taken at φ = 0.68), might be produced by some kind of inter-

which is not possible to model using the assumption of spherical
symmetry that PoWR employs. This disagreement might be re-
lated to similar features observed in other strong lines, as further
discussed in Sect. 5.3.

too strong (weak) absorption.

Unfortunately, other resonance lines available in the spectrum
(N V, C IV and Si IV) are saturated in the models within a reason-
able range of parameters around the best-ﬁt, and consequently
are not suitable for the ˙M diagnosis. Interestingly, in contrast to
the models, the N V and Si IV resonance lines are slightly de-
saturated in the observations (see Fig. 15). The origin of this
phenomenon might be related to the presence of optically thick
clumps (macroclumping), which directly affects the mass-loss
rate estimations (Oskinova et al. 2007; Šurlan et al. 2012). Un-
doubtedly, its study deserves further investigation, which is be-
yond the scope of this work.

We adopted the value of rot sin i = 56 km/s derived by
Fraser et al. (2010). Previous estimations pointed to much higher
values around 115 km/s (Zuiderwijk 1995; Howarth et al. 1997),
but such a high rotational velocity is not compatible with some
of the lines that we see unblended in the optical observation (see
Fig. 17). The rotational velocity directly affects the estimation
of the neutron star mass (MNS
VELA X-1) from radial velocity curves,
as shown by Koenigsberger et al. (2012). If rot sin i = 56 km/s,

ing ˙M √D in order to ﬁt Hα. However, as shown in Fig. 16, Hα in
our observation is not compatible with β = 0.5. As we mentioned
above, Hα might suffer from important variability along the or-
bit. Moreover, the X-ray irradiation from the neutron star might
produce variations in the stellar wind. In our opinion, this might
be the cause of the apparent disagreement between the conclu-
sions extracted from the X-rays and the optical wavebands.

The chemical composition was estimated following the same
approach as it was done for IGR J17544-2619. Interestingly, we

To summarise, our new analysis of Vela X-1 is in broad
agreement with previous studies of this system. We ﬁnd a rather
low stellar wind velocity, while ˙M is typical for the stars of its
spectral type. Like other studies, we note spectral line variability
in dependence with orbital phase, and attribute it to the inﬂuence
of the X-rays and the compact object on the stellar wind.

The ﬁnal physical parameters of the the two sources obtained in
this work are shown in Table 3.

5. Discussion

5.1. Wind-fed accretion

In SFXTs and SGXBs, the X-ray emission is powered by the ac-
cretion of matter from the donor’s wind onto the compact object.
The efﬁciency of the conversion of the potential energy into X-
ray luminosity depends on many factors including the properties
of the stellar wind, the properties of the compact object and the
orbital separation.

The most efﬁcient way of producing X-rays is the so called direct
accretion: the stellar wind that is gravitationally captured by the
neutron star free-falls onto the compact object. The expected lu-
minosity is close to the accretion luminosity Lacc. The following

by the neutron star; a is the orbital distance and Lacc is the
accretion luminosity, namely, the luminosity that would arise if
the whole potential energy of the accreted matter is eventually
transformed in X-ray luminosity.

For IGR J17544-2619, using the results of our spectral ﬁtting, the
data shown in Table 5 and assuming a circular orbit, we obtain
from Eq. 2c:

Lacc = 1.4 · 1036 erg/s

The value of Lacc is 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than
the luminosity that
the source exhibits most of the time:
LX < 5 · 1034 erg/s (Bozzo et al. 2015). Most likely, some in-
hibition mechanism is acting in IGR J17544-2619 (Drave et al.
2014; Bozzo et al. 2008).

As a possible explanation for the variability of IGR J17544-
2619 and its lower-than-expected luminosity at quiescence,
Bozzo et al. (2008) discussed the application of their model to
the light curve of an outburst observed by Chandra. This theo-
retical framework describes the mechanisms for the inhibition of
the accretion according to the relative size of the spheres deﬁned
by Ra, RM and Rco; where Ra is the already deﬁned accretion
radius, RM is the magnetospheric radius (location where the
pressure exerted by the gas equals the local magnetic pressure),

and Rco is the co-rotation radius (location where the angular
velocity of the neutron star equals the Keplerian velocity).
These radii, in turn, depend on: ˙M, rel, magnetic moment of the
neutron star (µ), orbital separation (a) and Pspin.

For simplicity, the orbital velocity of the neutron star and the
eccentricity are not considered in the model by Bozzo et al.
(2008). That is to say, it is assumed that e = 0 and wind ≃ rel,
where wind is the stellar wind velocity in the position of the
neutron star. We note that when the stellar wind velocity is not
very high, this assumption might not be accurate. Indeed, the
orbital velocity (orb) in Vela X-1 is very similar to wind (see
Table 5). In IGR J17544-2619, the orbital velocity is around the
half of the stellar wind velocity. Despite these simpliﬁcations,
the model provides signiﬁcant insight on the explanation of
the qualitative behavior of the sources with regard to their
persistence or variability, as it is shown next in this section. A
more accurate approach considering eccentric orbits and the
orbital velocity of the compact object would be an important
advance in the model, but it is out of the scope of this paper.

Nowadays,
the tentative estimations of the spin period in
IGR J17544-2619 (Pspin = 71.49s by Drave et al. (2012) and
alternatively Pspin = 11.58s by Romano et al. 2015), along
with the stellar wind parameters derived in this work, permit
to discuss the application of the model by Bozzo et al. (2008)
from a new perspective. The rest of parameters required for
this section are shown in Table 5. Using those values, we can
elaborate diagrams wind- ˙M and wind-Pspin, where the different
accretion regimes occupy different domains of the space of
parameters. These domains directly arise from the Eq. 25-28 by
Bozzo et al. (2008).

In Fig. 18 we show the position of IGR J17544-2619 in the dia-
gram wind-Pspin for the two currently available tentative estima-
tions of the Pspin. The source lie in the direct accretion regime
for Pspin = 71.49s, and in the supersonic propeller regime for
Pspin = 11.58s. Hence, the shortest Pspin = 11.58s matches bet-
ter with the X-ray behavior of the source and its likelihood of
staying in an inhibited accretion regime.

A. Giménez-García: Title

In Fig. 19 we show the location of IGR J17544-2619 in the di-
agram wind- ˙M. It is important to note that the position of the
system in this diagram is not a ﬁxed point due to the the in-
trinsic variability of the velocity and local density of the stellar
wind in hot massive stars. Thus, we have plotted a red region in
Fig. 19 showing a variability of one order of magnitude in wind
and ˙M. That is to say, the maximum ˙M and wind in the encir-
cled region is ten times higher than the minimum ˙M and wind.
Such a variability is fully plausible, as demonstrated by hydro-
dynamical simulations of radiatively driven stellar winds (e.g.
Feldmeier et al. 1997). These clumps of higher density, intrinsic
to stellar winds of hot stars, are sometimes invoked to explain
the X-ray variability of HMXBs (Oskinova et al. 2012). As we
can see in Fig. 19, the encircled region intersects regimes of di-
rect accretion and inhibited accretion. Hence, it is possible that
in objects like IGR J17544-2619, the abrupt changes in the wind
density may lead to the switching from one accretion regime to
the other. Moreover, besides the clumping of the stellar wind, the
eccentricity of the orbit (e < 0.25) would lead to additional vari-
ations in the orbital separation (and consequently in wind and the
density of the medium), which reinforce the intrinsic variability
of the stellar wind and its capability to lead to transitions across
regimes.

Considering an alternative explanation for the X-ray variability
of IGR J17544-2619, Drave et al. (2014) invoked the quasi-
spherical accretion model by Shakura et al. (2012). However,
if the spin period is actually as short as 71.49s or 11.58s, the
condition of a slowly rotating pulsar, i.e. RM ≪ Rco (where RM
is the magnetospheric radius and Rco the co-rotation radius),
assumed by this approach, would be debatable. Even though
it raises doubts about the feasibility of applying this model, it
cannot be ruled out until the spin period and the magnetic ﬁeld
of the neutron star are ﬁrmly constrained.

In the case of Vela X-1, we can see in Fig. 20 and 21, the
source is well in the middle of the zone where direct accretion is
expected. Hence, more extreme density or velocity jumps would
be required to trigger any change of accretion regime. These
extreme jumps are also plausible, but much more unlikely.
However, they might sporadically occur and lead to a sudden
decrease of the luminosity in Vela X-1.

Using the parameters shown in Table 5 and Eq. 2c, we obtain
Lacc = 8.7 × 1036 erg/s for Vela X-1. The average X-rays lumi-
nosity of the source is hLXi ≃ 4.5×1036 (Sako et al. 1999). More
speciﬁcally, Lacc ≃ 0.5 × hLXi. This means that there is a good
agreement between Lacc and LX, which implies that the direct ac-
cretion scenario can describe the way that matter is accreted in
Vela X-1.

The framework of different accretion regimes described by
Bozzo et al. (2008) is able to explain why IGR J17544-2619 is
prone to show a high X-ray variability and inhibited accretion
(assuming the shortest Pspin = 11.58s), and Vela X-1 is persis-
tently very luminous in the X-rays. As exposed in Fig. 19 and
21, the required variability in the stellar wind for a transition
in the accretion regime is far lower in IGR J17544-2619 than
in Vela X-1. The main ingredients that make the sources so
different are the Pspin (shorter in IGR J17544-2619), and the
wind (larger in IGR J17544-2619).

We may conjecture whether this theoretical framework can be
applied to other SGXBs and SFXTs. Unfortunately there are not

many sources where we can ﬁnd complementary studies includ-
ing dedicated analysis of the stellar wind, orbital parameters
and neutron star parameters. The studies of the stellar wind are
specially scarce. Besides the two sources analysed in this work,
there are at least four where a comparable amount of informa-
tion is available in the literature. They are IGR J11215-5952,
GX 301-2, X1908+075 and OAO 1657-415. We show the dia-
grams wind-Pspin and wind- ˙M for these sources in Appendix A.
Again, the diagrams seem to qualitatively explain the behavior
of the systems. GX 301-2, X1908+075 and OAO 1657-415 are
persistent SGXBs, and they occupy regions of highly likelihood
of persistent emission in the diagrams. In contrast, the like-
lihood of regime transitions in IGR J11215-5952 is much higher.

IGR J11215-5952 is a system with very large eccentricity and
long orbital period (Romano et al. 2009). It shows recurrent
ﬂares with a period of ∼ 330d (Sidoli et al. 2006). Its high
variability leads to its classiﬁcation as a SFXT, even though the
predictability of the ﬂares is not a common feature in the rest
of SFXTs. Sidoli et al. (2007) proposed that the recurrent ﬂares
might be explained by an additional equatorial component of
the stellar wind combined with the highly eccentric orbit. In
Figure A.1 we can see that a moderate clumpiness would lead

to frequent transition regimes, and hence it would be expected
a very high X-rays variability. However, the diagram shown
in Figure A.1 is calculated assuming a circular orbit, which
is not accurate for IGR J11215-5952. In this source, the high
eccentricity of the system might be a more important factor than
the clumpiness of the wind, and the transition into the direct
accretion regime might be likely only during near-periastron
passages, producing periodic outbursts.

Regarding other systems,
the framework used here might
encounter problems to explain the behavior of other SFXTs
with larger Pspin such as IGR J16418-4532 (Pspin = 1212s,
Sidoli et al. 2012) and IGR J16465-4507 (Pspin = 228s,
Lutovinov et al. 2005). The estimation of the stellar wind
parameters in these systems will be very useful to measure
the extent of the applicability of the model by Bozzo et al.
(2008) explaining the dichotomy between SGXBs and SFXTs.
Moreover, studies of the X-rays absorption might provide an ad-
ditional perspective on the issue. Giménez-García et al. (2015)
studied a sample of SGXBs and SFXTs using XMM-Newton
and it was observed that the SGXBs included in the sample were

in general more absorbed than the SFXTs. This may suggest a
more intense interaction of the X-rays radiation with the stellar
wind, or, alternatively, that the neutron star orbits a more dense
medium in SGXBs due to a closer orbit or a slower stellar wind
of the donor.

and the esc that we obtain
Finally, we can compare the ∞
from the ﬁts. In this regard, Lamers et al. (1995) collected a
large dataset from hot stars with radiatively driven winds, and
concluded that the ratio ∞/esc steeply decreases from ∼ 2.6
to ∼ 1.3 when going from high to low Teff at a point near
Teff ≃ 21000 K, corresponding to spectral type around B1. Ac-
cording to Vink et al. (1999), this drop is caused by a decrease
in the line acceleration of Fe III in the subsonic part of the wind.
In our case we have (see Table 3):
– IGR J17544-2619 (O9.5I): ∞/esc = 2.4+0.7
−0.5
– Vela X-1 (B0.5I): ∞/esc = 1.6+0.8
−0.4
These values follow the trend observed and described by
Lamers et al. (1995). We suggest that it might be the reason why
than Vela X-1. The action of
IGR J17544-2619 shows higher ∞
the X-rays can also make an important impact in the velocity of
the stellar wind, as shown by Karino (2014). However, this effect
is probably local, since we do not observe important differences
in the terminal velocity between eclipsing and non-eclipsing or-
bital phases in Vela X-1. Secondary features like asymmetries
or additional absorption components in the spectral lines, which
might be related to the effect of the X-rays in the stellar wind,
are described and discussed below in Sect. 5.3.

5.2. Evolutionary tracks

In Fig. 22 we show the position of Vela X-1 and IGR J17544-
2619 in the Hertzprung-Russell Diagram (HRD), and the evolu-
tionary tracks from the Geneva Stellar Models (Ekström et al.
2012). The two stars lie on the theoretical track of a star
. In IGR J17544-2619 the
with initial mass ∼ 25 − 30 M
⊙
spectroscopic mass obtained from the ﬁts is compatible with
the evolutionary mass. Vela X-1 shows certain overluminosity,
since its spectroscopic mass is lower than the evolutionary mass.
Nevertheless, the mass of the star obviously decreases along
its lifetime due to the stellar wind and possible mass transfer
episodes. These phenomena might have been stronger or longer
in Vela X-1 compared to IGR J17544-2619.

The overabundance of helium and nitrogen arising from the ﬁts
in the two stars might trigger an increase in luminosity follow-
ing the scaling relation L ∝ µα, where µ is the average mean
molecular weight and α > 1 (Langer 1992). Then, we expect
certain overluminosity in both sources. However, as already
mentioned, the overluminosity is more noticeable in Vela X-1.
In all, the sources seem to be in a different evolutionary stage or
to have experienced a different evolutionary history.

The chemical evolution of the donors might have been driven
by episodes of important mass transfer in the past, given the
close orbits of the systems, enhancing the helium and nitrogen
abundances due to the accretion of chemically enriched mate-
rial (Langer 2012). Moreover, Roche-lobe overﬂow stages in-
duce important spin-up in the mass gainer (Packet 1981), induc-
ing further chemical enrichment because of rotational mixing.
This scenario is supported by the observation of other HMXBs
where indications of nitrogen enhancement are also observed

5.3. Asymmetries in spectral lines of Vela X-1

Some of the lines in the spectrum of Vela X-1 show clear asym-
metries that are not possible to reproduce with spherically sym-
metric models like PoWR (see Fig. 23). This striking feature is
specially noticeable for He I lines, but it is also observed in C, N,
O or Si, whenever the lines are strong enough.

also reported by
Martínez-Núñez et al. (2015) in hydrogen lines of the in-
frared spectrum of X1908+75, a SGXB. A natural explanation
for the discrepancy between models and observations is the
departure of the donor and/or the surrounding medium from the
spherical symmetry. This departure may be triggered by tidally
induced effects and the persistent X-ray irradiation of the stellar
wind and the stellar surface. In this regard, Koenigsberger et al.
(2012) showed that tidal effects would produce asymmetries in
the line proﬁles.

The observed asymmetries might be related to the additional ab-
sorption that we observe in the blue part of other important lines,
with special attention to Hα, Hβ, Hγ and Si IV λ 1394, 1403 Å
(see Fig. 24). Assuming that the absorption is produced by an in-
dependent component of matter moving at certain velocity, it is
striking that the involved velocities required for explaining such
a blueshif are different depending on the lines: ∼ 200− 300 km/s
in Hα, Hβ and Hγ, ∼ 1000 km/s in the Si IV resonance lines.
In any case, we note that these asymmetries and additional ab-
sorption features have not been observed in IGR J17544-2619.
Hence, the physical cause at work is playing a signiﬁcantly more
important role in Vela X-1 than in IGR J17544-2619. This fact
suggests that the interaction of the X-ray source with the stel-
lar wind might be fundamental for understanding these asym-
metries, given that the X-rays are on average more intense in
Vela X-1. Indeed, if we compare the wind mechanic luminosity

– IGR J17544-2619: Lmech ≃ 1036 erg/s. That is to say, at least
two orders of magnitude higher than the usual X-ray lumi-
nosity of the source.

– Vela X-1: Lmech ≃ 1035 erg/s. Namely, about one order of
magnitude lower than the X-ray luminosity of the source in
quiescence.

Hence, there is a fundamental difference in the ratio Lmech/LX.
The X-rays are much more powerful with respect to the stellar
wind in Vela X-1 rather than in IGR J17544-2619. We suggest
that this fact might be related to the asymmetries that we observe
in the spectral lines of Vela X-1, but not in IGR J17544-2619.

6. Summary and conclusions
We have performed a detailed analysis of the donors of the
HMXBs IGR J17544-2619 and Vela X-1, using the code PoWR
that computes models of hot stellar atmospheres. We found
the luminosity, extinction, stellar mass, stellar radius, effective
temperature, effective surface gravity, terminal velocity of the
stellar wind, mass-loss rate, clumping factor, micro and macro-
turbulent velocity, rotational velocity and chemical abundances.

The estimation of the above mentioned parameters has impli-
cations on other physical parameters of the system: the derived
stellar radius of IGR J17544-2619 implies an upper limit in the
eccentricity of the source: e < 0.25. The rotational velocity

).

The donors of IGR J17544-2619 and Vela X-1 are similar
in many of the parameters that physically characterise them
and their spectrum. Moreover, they are also comparable in the
eccentricity and orbital separation. However, in the context
of accretion regimes described by Bozzo et al. (2008), their
moderate differences in the stellar wind velocity and the Pspin of
the neutron star lead to a very different accretion regimes of the
sources, which qualitatively explain their completely different
X-ray behavior. After analysing other sources with sufﬁcient
information available in the literature, we have observed that the
same theoretical framework is valid to qualitatively explain their
X-ray behavior. Further explorations addressing the estimation
of the stellar wind properties of the donors in SGXBs and
SFXTs, complemented with Pspin measurements in SFXTs, will
be necessary to conﬁrm whether the conclusions exposed here
can be extrapolated to additional members of these groups of
HMXBs.

In summary, this study shows that the wind terminal velocity
play a decisive role in determining the class of HMXB hosting
a supergiant donor. While low stellar wind velocity facilitates
direct steady accretion in SGXBs, the high wind velocity and

Article number, page 16 of 26

velocity jumps can easily shift the accretion mechanism from
direct accretion to propeller regimes in SFXTs. This effects
might be enhanced by other factors such as the eccentricity of
the sources. We conclude that this is one of the mechanisms
responsible for these two major sub-classes of HMXBs with
supergiant donors.
