Abstract. Binary mixtures of large and small particles with disparate size ratio
exhibit a rich phenomenology at their glass transition points. In order to gain insights
on such systems, we introduce and study a two-component version of the p-spin
spherical spin glass model. We employ the replica method to calculate the free energy
and the phase diagram. We show that when the strengths of the interactions of each
component are not widely separated, the model has only one glass phase characterized
by the conventional one-step replica symmetry breaking. However when the strengths
of the interactions are well separated, the model has three glass phases depending
on temperature and component ratio. One is the “single” glass phase in which only
the spins of one component are frozen while the spins of the other component remain
mobile. This phase is characterized by the one-step replica symmetry breaking. The
second is the “double” glass phase obtained by cooling further the single glass phase,
in which the spins of the remaining mobile component are also frozen. This phase
is characterized by the two-step replica symmetry breaking. The third is also the
“double” glass phase, which however is formed by the simultaneous freezing of the
spins of both components at the same temperatures and is characterized by the one-
step replica symmetry breaking. We discuss the implications of these results for the
glass transitions of binary mixtures.

The decoupling of the glass transitions in the two-component p-spin spherical model

1. Introduction

The p-spin spherical model (PSM) has been playing important roles in the study of
the glass transition of liquids, because it shares many common properties in dynamics
and thermodynamics with glass forming liquids [1, 2, 3, 4]. The PSM is the inﬁnite
range spin glass model in which soft spins interact through p-body interactions with
random quenched couplings [5]. The dynamics of the PSM can be solved semi-
analytically [1, 5, 6]. Particularly at p = 3, the time correlation function is known to
obey the dynamical equation mathematically equivalent with the mode-coupling theory
(MCT) equation of the glass transition [1, 7]. The system is ergodic at high temperature,
however as temperature is decreased, the time correlation function exhibits the two
step relaxation behavior and the relaxation becomes slower and slower. Eventually
the relaxation time diverges and the spins get frozen, which is called the dynamical
transition. Also the thermodynamics of the PSM can be solved semi-analytically by the
replica method with the one-step replica symmetry breaking (1RSB) ansatz [5, 8]. As
temperature is lowered from above, the phase space of the system in the paramagnetic
state splits into many metastable glassy states exactly at the dynamical transition
temperature. As the system is cooled further, the logarithm of the number of these
states or the complexity, which corresponds to the conﬁgurational entropy in glass
forming liquids, decreases and eventually becomes zero where the thermodynamic glass
transition takes place. In the glass phase, the free energy of the model is dominated by
the lower energy states. The similarity between the PSM and glass forming liquids has
many to believe that they are in the same class of random glassy systems, at least in
the mean-ﬁeld limit [3, 4].

However, real glass formers often exhibit richer and more anomalous dynamical
behaviors, all of which can not be captured by the PSM. In this work, we particularly
focus on the “decoupling” phenomenon often observed in multi-component glass formers.
This is the phenomenon in which the slowing down of the dynamics of each component
occurs separately at diﬀerent regions of the densities and the temperatures, hence some
components are frozen into a glass state while the others remain mobile. There is a
wide variety of materials showing the decoupling phenomenon, such as ionic glasses
and metallic glasses [9]. The simplest example among them is presumably a binary
mixture of large and small particles with disparate size ratio [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,
17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]. When the size ratio is suﬃciently large, it is observed in
experiments [10, 11] and simulations [18, 19, 20] that there are two distinct glass phases
in this model: the “single” glass where only large particles are arrested while small
particles are left mobile, and the “double” glass where both small and large particles
are arrested. Despite of simplicity of the model, this decoupling phenomenon of binary
mixtures is not fully understood theoretically.
It is encouraging that the MCT can
predict this behavior qualitatively [21, 22, 23]. However the MCT is derived using
numerous uncontrorable approximations, which are not guaranteed to be valid for binary
mixtures with disparate size ratio. Even for monodisperse systems, there is an argument

The decoupling of the glass transitions in the two-component p-spin spherical model

whether or not the MCT is a true “mean-ﬁeld theory” to describe the dynamics of the
glass transition [24, 25, 26, 27]. Moreover the transition predicted by the MCT only
exists in the mean-ﬁeld limit and is washed away in ﬁnite dimensions [3, 4].

Can any of spin glass models qualitatively capture these rich behaviors of the glass
transitions of binary mixtures? If so, analysis of such models should facilitate the study
of binary mixtures because spin models can be analyzed rigorously at least in the mean-
ﬁeld limit. Related to this point, Crisanti and Leuzzi generalized the PSM to include two
distinct energy scales of the interactions [28, 29, 30, 31]. They considered the s + p-spin
spherical model, where all spins interact through both s-body and p-body interactions.
This model is potentially related to the glass forming liquids in which molecules are
subject to two diﬀerent types of interactions. They found that there is a variety of glass
phases characterized by the series of replica symmetry breaking [30] and that the model
exhibits rich dynamical behaviors such as three-step relaxation of the time correlation
function [31]. However to the best of our knowledge, there exists no study on the spin
glass model which exhibits the single and double glass transitions and the decoupling
of dynamics of one of the components from the other, as observed for binary mixtures.
In this work, we extend the PSM so as to mimic binary mixtures of particles
with disparate size ratio. Our model is a two component version of the PSM, which is
composed of weakly interacting spins (weak spins) and strongly interacting spins (strong
spins). We employ the replica theory to study the thermodynamics of the model. We
found that the model has the glass phases characterized by either conventional 1RSB and
the two-step replica symmetry breaking (2RSB). We show that the interplay between
the 1RSB and the 2RSB solutions results in the decoupling of the glass transitions of
weak spins from that of strong spins. We also show that our two component PSM is
directly related to the randomly pinned PSM, which has been studied recently [32].
Finally based on the results, we discuss the validity of the predictions of the MCT for
the multiple glass phases of binary mixtures.

The organization of the paper is as follows. In Section II, we introduce the model.
In Section III, we use the replica theory to express the free energy in terms of the spin
glass order parameters. In Section IV, by numerical minimization of the free energy, we
obtain the temperature evolutions of the order parameters, the phase diagrams, and the
thermodynamic quantities of the model. In Sections V and VI, we discuss the results
and conclude the work.

2. Model

We consider a two component version of the PSM with p = 3. The model
is
composed of N1 spins of the component 1 and N2 spins of the component 2, with
N = N1 + N2. The spin variables for each component are denoted as σ1,i (i = 1, · · · , N1)

and σ2,i (i = 1, · · · , N2), respectively. They obey the spherical constraints N1 =Pi σ2

(1)

where the greek indices are used to indicate components, the roman indices are for
spins, and J (αβγ)
iαjβ kγ is the coupling constant among the three spins, which is the Gaussian
random variables with zero mean. In order to render the analysis tractable, we consider
the case where J (αβγ)

iαjβ kγ is characterized by only the two values, i.e.

(α, β, γ) = (1, 1, 1),

(α, β, γ) 6= (1, 1, 1).

(2)

Here J1 and J2 are the typical energy scales of the interactions of the component 1
and 2, respectively. We set J1 > J2, hence the component 1 is “strong” spins and 2
is “weak” spins. The control parameters of the model are the ratio of the strengths of
the interactions J = J2/J1, the fraction of strong spins c = N1/N, and the temperature
T . We use J1, J1/kB and kB for the units of the energy, temperature, and the entropy,
respectively, where kB is the Boltzmann constant. All the results are obtained in the
thermodynamic limit.

3. Free energy calculation

We calculate the free energy of the model using the standard replica method. In the
method, the free energy of the original model is obtained by taking the limit n → 0 of
the free energy of n replicas. The procedure of this calculation for the one-component
PSM is well documented in Ref. [5, 8]. Following the same procedure, we write down
the free energy of the two-component PSM as

3.1. 1RSB ansatz

In the case of the one-component PSM, it is known that the 1RSB ansatz gives the
correct solution. The 1RSB ansatz assumes that the overlap matrices have a one-step

Here, q1 and p1 are called the self overlaps, which are the overlaps within the same glassy
states, and q0 and p0 are the overlaps between diﬀerent glassy states (Figure 1 left). We
can assume q0 = p0 = 0 that is valid for the PSM without external ﬁelds. Substituting
equations (5a) and (5b) into equation (4), and taking the limit n → 0 in equation (3),
we obtain

(1 − c)3J 2/4T 2. The breaking parameter m1 should be limited to 0 ≤ m1 ≤ 1 in the
limit n → 0. When m1 = 1, this 1RSB free energy reduces to that of the paramagnetic
state. When G1RSB is extremized with respect to q1, p1, and m1, the 1RSB solution of
the model is obtained. The 1RSB dynamical transition is deﬁned as the transition where
the overlaps q1 and p1 change discontinuously, and the 1RSB thermodynamic transition
is deﬁned as the transition where the 1RSB solution with m1 6= 1 becomes stable.

3.2. 2RSB ansatz

Our model is the two component PSM with the two distinct energy scales J1 and J2,
which make the thermodynamic phase diagram more complex. Especially there is no

guarantee that the 1RSB ansatz gives the stable solution. Therefore, we have to allow
the two-step hierarchical structure of the overlap matrices:

Qab = (1 − q2)δab + (q2 − q1)ǫm2
Pab = (1 − p2)δab + (p2 − p1)ǫm2

ab + (q1 − q0)ǫm1

which are called the 2RSB ansatz. This ansatz corresponds to the two-step hierarchical
structure of the free energy landscape as depicted schematically in Figure 1 right. Here,
q2 and p2 are the self overlaps, q1 and p1 are the overlaps between the diﬀerent glassy
states in the same group in the intermediate level of the hierarchy, and q0 and p0 are
the overlaps between the diﬀerent glassy states in the diﬀerent groups. Substituting
equations (9a) and (9b) into equation (4) and taking the limit n → 0 in equation (3),
we obtain

The breaking parameters m1 and m2 should be limited to 0 ≤ m1 < m2 ≤ 1. When
m2 = 1, the 2RSB free energy G2RSB, equation (11), reduces to the 1RSB free energy
G1RSB, equation (8). By minimizing G2RSB in equation (11) with respect to the order
parameters q1, p1, q2, p2, m1 and m2, the free energy and the order parameters of the
original system is obtained within the 2RSB ansatz. The 2RSB dynamical transition is
deﬁned as the transition where the overlaps q2 and p2 change discontinuously, and the
2RSB thermodynamic transition is deﬁned as the transition where the 2RSB solution
with m2 6= 1 becomes stable ‡.

3.3. Numerical minimization of G2RSB

We focus on the minimization of G2RSB. We do not need to analyze G1RSB separately,
because G1RSB is included in G2RSB as discussed above. We employ the following
numerical method to minimize G2RSB. For a given c, we ﬁrst focus on a low enough
temperature (in practice, we set T = J/3) and minimize G2RSB by the steepest descent
method. We take a special care in this procedure because the calculation easily gets
stuck in locally stable solutions. In order to avoid this unwanted eﬀect, we ﬁrst slice the
(m1, m2) space to 50 grid points and minimize G2RSB with respect to q1, p1, q2 and p2

‡ We did not explore the possibilities of RSB of the higher order than 2RSB. Note that the 2RSB is
guaranteed to be suﬃcient at least in the limit J → 0 because this limit corresponds to the randomly
pinned PSM where the solution corresponding to the 2RSB is veriﬁed to be stable [32].

at each grid point. We seek for the set of (m1, m2) which minimizes G2RSB. Using this
(m1, m2) as an initial guess, we perform the full steepest descent optimization of all the
order parameters. After obtaining the optimized solution at the lowest temperature, we
gradually increase the temperature and employ the steepest descent method to minimize
G2RSB at each temperature, using the optimal values of the order parameters at the lower
temperature as an initial guess.

4. Phase diagrams and thermodynamic quantities

In this section, we show the phase diagrams and the thermodynamic quantities of the
two-component PSM obtained by the minimization of G2RSB. We ﬁnd that the model
has a variety of glass phases including the “single” and the “double” glasses when J is
very diﬀerent from 1.

4.1. Order parameters and phase diagrams

4.1.1. J = 0.3. We start with J = 0.3, which is not very diﬀerent from 1. We show the
phase diagram in Figure 2. There are only the paramagnetic phase and the 1RSB glass
phase. The two phases are separated by the 1RSB thermodynamic transition line TK(c).
The 1RSB dynamical transition line Td(c) is located at slightly higher temperatures.
Note that Td(c) and TK(c) for c = 1 match with the results of the one-component PSM
of the strong spins. They are Td(c = 1) = 0.612 and TK(c = 1) = 0.586. Td(c) and TK(c)
for c = 0 are identical to those for c = 1 aside from the obvious factor of J, which deﬁnes
the unit of the energy, i.e., Td(c = 0) = 0.612J = 0.184 and TK(c = 0) = 0.586J = 0.176.
The transition lines smoothly connect these two limiting cases.

parameter m1 at c = 0.2 (left) and 0.9 (right) at J = 0.3. The short red and long black
arrows indicate the 1RSB dynamical and thermodynamic transition temperatures Td
and TK, respectively.

In order to gain more insights, in Figure 3, we plot the temperature dependence of
the optimized overlaps q1 and p1 and the breaking parameter m1 at two representative
values of c = 0.2 and 0.9. At c = 0.2 (Figure 3 left), as temperature is decreased, the
overlaps q1 and p1 jump from zero while the breaking parameter remains constant m1 = 1
at the 1RSB dynamical transition temperature Td. m1 suddenly starts decreasing from
1 at the 1RSB thermodynamic transition temperature TK. The 1RSB dynamical and
thermodynamic transition temperatures (Td(c = 0.2) = 0.192 and TK(c = 0.2) = 0.184)
are close to those of the one-component PSM of weak spins (Td(c = 0) = 0.184 and
TK(c = 0) = 0.176), indicating that the 1RSB transition at c = 0.2 is driven mainly
by the freezing of the weak spins. Note that both the values of q1 and p1 just below
the transition temperatures are larger than 0.5 and are close to each other, which can
be interpreted that both the strong and weak spins are frozen equally strongly at this
transition.

Behaviors at c = 0.9 (Figure 3 right) are qualitatively similar to those at c = 0.2.
The only diﬀerences are that (i) the 1RSB dynamical and thermodynamic transition
temperatures (Td(c = 0.9) = 0.552 and TK(c = 0.9) = 0.528) are close to those of the
one-component PSM of the strong spins (Td(c = 1) = 0.612 and TK(c = 1) = 0.586) and
that (ii) the value of q1 is larger than 0.5 while the value of p1 is much smaller just below
the transition temperatures. These results can be interpreted that the 1RSB transition
at c = 0.9 is driven mainly by the freezing of the strong spins, and the weak spins
are not strongly frozen at this transition. However we emphasize that this diﬀerence is
only quantitative and the overlaps of the weak and strong spins vary continuously as c
changes. Namely there is no clear signature of the decoupling of the glass transitions of
the weak and strong spins.

4.1.2. J = 0.03. Next we focus on J = 0.03, which is much smaller than 1. In Figure 4
left, we show the phase diagram, which is qualitatively diﬀerent from that at J = 0.3.

One ﬁnds that there are three glass phases. We refer to them as the 1RSB(1), the
1RSB(2), and the 2RSB glass phases. The paramagnetic phase is separated from the
1RSB(1) and the 1RSB(2) glass phases by the 1RSB thermodynamic transition line
T (1)
K (c). The associated 1RSB dynamical transition line T (1)
d (c) is located at slightly

The 1RSB(2) and the 2RSB glass phases are separated by the 2RSB thermodynamic
transition line T (2)
K (c). To present the details of the 2RSB glass phase region, we show the
zoom in Figure 4 right. The 2RSB thermodynamic transition line T (2)
K (c) is composed
of two parts: T (2d)
K (c) at higher fraction of
strong spins, depending on the discontinuous and continuous nature of the transition
across this temperature. The 2RSB dynamical transition line T (2)

above T (2d)
K (c) and it terminates at the critical point (Tc, cc) ≈ (0.022, 0.17), at which the
three transition lines T (2)
K (c) meet. The thermodynamic transition
line which separates the 1RSB(1) glass from the 2RSB glass is denoted as TX(c). The
three thermodynamic transition lines, T (1)

1RSB dynamical and thermodynamic transition temperatures (T (1)
d (c = 0.02) = 0.0185
and T (1)
K (c = 0.02) = 0.0177) are close to those of the one-component PSM of the
weak spins (T (1)
K (c = 0) = 0.0176), which indicates that the
transition into the 1RSB(1) glass phase is driven mainly by the freezing of the weak
spins. Both the values of q1 and p1 are larger than 0.5 and are close to each other below
T (1)
K , which can be interpreted that both the strong and weak spins are frozen equally
strongly in the 1RSB(1) glass phase.

and T (1)

The upper right panel of Figure 5 shows the results at c = 0.08, where there
are the 1RSB transition from the paramagnetic to the 1RSB(2) glass phase, and the
2RSB transition from the 1RSB(2) to the 2RSB glass phase. The 1RSB dynamical
and thermodynamic transitions at T (1)
K are qualitatively the same as those for
c = 0.02. The only diﬀerence is that the value of q1 is larger than 0.5 while p1 is very
close to zero. This result can be interpreted that the strong spins are frozen while the
weak spins are not frozen in the 1RSB(2) glass phase. As we decrease temperature
further, the 2RSB transition takes place. First at T (2)
d , the overlaps q2 and p2 change
discontinuously while the breaking parameter remains constant m2 = 1. At T (2d)
K , m2
suddenly starts decreasing from 1, where the 2RSB thermodynamic transition takes
place. Note that p2 is larger than 0.5 just below T (2d)
K , which can be interpreted that
the weak spins are also frozen in the 2RSB glass phase.

Behaviors at c = 0.13 (Figure 5 lower left) are qualitatively similar to those
at c = 0.08. The only diﬀerence is that the discontinuities of q2 and p2 at the
2RSB dynamical transition are smaller than those for c = 0.08. As c increases, the
discontinuities at the 2RSB dynamical transition become smaller, and eventually the
jump of q2 and p2 disappear at c = 0.17. The lower right panel of Figure 5 shows the
results at c = 0.21. The overlaps q2 and p2 change from q1 and p1 continuously at T (2c)
K ,
where the continuous 2RSB thermodynamic transition takes place. Interestingly, the
change of the breaking parameter m2 at T (2c)
K is not continuous as in the case at T (2d)
but discontinuous.

In summary, the 1RSB(2) glass corresponds to the “single” glass where only the
strong spins are frozen, and the 1RSB(1) and the 2RSB glasses correspond to the
“double” glass where both the weak and strong spins are frozen simultaneously. We
emphasize that there is a clear diﬀerence between these two “double” glasses, the
1RSB(1) and the 2RSB. The transition into the 1RSB(1) glass phase is the simultaneous
arrest of the weak and the strong spins. This transition is mainly driven by the freezing
of the weak spins. On the other hand, the transition into the 2RSB glass phase is
the arrest of the weak spins in the presence of the frozen strong spins which already
undergoes the glass transition at much higher temperature. The diﬀerence becomes
clearer when one considers the free energy landscape of these phases. In the 1RSB(1)
glass phase, the landscape can be characterized by the one-step hierarchical structure
(Figure 1 left). Only the self overlap q1 and p1 have large values, and q0 and p0 are zero.
This means that the diﬀerent glassy states have completely diﬀerent conﬁgurations of
spins. On the other hand in the 2RSB glass phase, the landscape has the two-step
hierarchical structure (Figure 1 right). Not only the self overlaps q2 and p2, but also the
overlap q1 have large values. This means that several glassy states in the same group
of the intermediate level of the hierarchy share almost the same conﬁguration of the
strong spins. In other words, the phase space is divided into a multi-valley structure
corresponding to conﬁgurations of the strong spins and each of the valley is divided into
a subgroups of multi-valley structure corresponding to conﬁgurations of the weak spins.
Note that the 1RSB(1) and the 2RSB glasses are separated by the glass-glass transition

Finally we obtain a semi-analytical expression for the continuous 2RSB transition
temperature T (2c)
K . This is possible because q2 − q1 and p2 − p1 are small just below
T (2c)
and thus the 2RSB solution can be expressed by the perturbation around the
1RSB solution (see Appendix for details). In Figure A1, we compare T (2c)
K calculated
by the perturbation theory with those calculated by the minimization of G2RSB. The
two results are almost identical, conﬁrming that our numerical minimization of G2RSB
is reliable.

4.1.3. The decoupling of the glass transitions of the weak and the strong spins. We
showed that there is only one glass phase at J = 0.3, whereas at J = 0.03 the decoupling
of the glass transitions of the weak and the strong spins takes place and, as a result, the
three glass phases appear. In this subsection, we estimate the value of J = J ⋆ at which
this decoupling sets in.

First we evaluate the phase diagram at various J in the range of 0.03 < J < 0.3 by
the minimization of G2RSB. We ﬁnd that the three glass phases exist at J ≤ 0.1 while
only one glass phase exists at J ≥ 0.2. This means 0.1 < J ⋆ < 0.2. However we can not
estimate J ⋆ more accurately by this procedure. Our numerical minimization becomes
unstable at 0.1 < J < 0.2 because the free energy diﬀerences between G1RSB and G2RSB
become small.

In the course of the evaluations of the phase diagrams described above, we ﬁnd that
whenever there exist the three glass phases, there also exists the glass-glass transition
point (T ⋆, c⋆) from the 1RSB(1) to the 1RSB(2) glass phase on the line T (1)
K (c), see
Figure 4. Here, we estimate J ⋆ assuming that J ⋆ is identical to the value of J just
below which the glass-glass transition point appears on the line T (1)
K (c). We evaluate

a function of c, which is the sign of the glass-glass transition. This analysis is numerically
easier than the full evaluation of the phase diagram because it requires the numerical
minimization only of G1RSB.
In Figure 6, we show the c dependence of the overlap
of weak spins p1 on the line T (1)
K (c), at several values of J. At J = 0.3, p1 decreases
smoothly with c and there is no glass-glass transition point. The decrease of p1 becomes
sharper with decreasing J, and becomes discontinuous just below J ≈ 0.15. From this
calculation, we estimate J ⋆ ≈ 0.15.

4.2. Thermodynamic quantities

In this subsection, we discuss the nature of the various glass phases of the model in
terms of the thermodynamic quantities.

Figure 7 shows the temperature dependence of the entropy S = −∂F/∂T and the
heat capacity C = −T ∂2F/∂T 2 at J = 0.03 at the same values of c in Figure 5. These
quantities are evaluated by numerical diﬀerentiation of the free energy obtained by the
minimization of G2RSB. At c = 0.02 (Figure 7 upper left), the entropy curve bends
and the heat capacity jumps discontinuously at the 1RSB thermodynamic transition

temperature T (1)
K . This is the typical behavior of the 1RSB glass transition. On the other
hand at c = 0.08 (Figure 7 upper right), the entropy curve bends and the heat capacity
jumps twice at the 1RSB and the 2RSB thermodynamic transition temperatures, T (1)
K
and T (2d)
K . As can be seen from the results at c = 0.13 (Figure 7 lower left) and 0.21
(Figure 7 lower right), the heat capacity jump at T (2d)
K becomes weaker with increasing
c and eventually disappears when the 2RSB transition becomes continuous. In order
to characterize the thermodynamics of the continuous 2RSB thermodynamic transition,
we plot the third order derivative of the free energy C3 = T 2∂3F/∂T 3 in the inset of
Figure 7 lower right. One ﬁnds that this quantity shows the discontinuous jump at the
continuous 2RSB transition temperature T (2c)
K . Thus the continuous 2RSB transition is
the third-order thermodynamic transition in nature. Note that the similar behavior has
been observed for the continuous 1RSB transition [8].

5. Discussion

We found that the two-component PSM has three glass phases at J ≤ 0.15: the 1RSB(1)
glass where both the strong and weak spins are frozen, the 1RSB(2) glass where only
the strong spins are frozen, and the 2RSB glass where both the strong and weak spins
are frozen and the free energy landscape has the two-step hierarchical structure.
In
this section, we discuss possible connections and implications of these results to other
systems.

5.1. Connection to the randamly pinned PSM

Interestingly,

In the randomly pinned PSM, a fraction of spins are pinned and the dynamics and
thermodynamics of remaining mobile spins are considered. This model has recently
attracted attention partly, because it enables us to probe the true thermodynamic
glass transition without waiting for the system to equilibrate, which otherwise takes
astronomically long time [32, 33, 34].
the 2RSB dynamical and
thermodynamic transition lines (see Figure 4 right) are analogous to the glass transition
lines of the randomly pinned glass [32]. In both cases, the overlap discontinuously jumps
at the dynamical transition lines when the density of the pinned spins (for the randomly
pinned PSM) or the strong spins (for the two-component PSM) is small. But as the
densities increase the discontinuities are weakened and eventually the transitions become
continuous at which the dynamical transition lines terminate. The similarity between
these two models is natural because, in the two-component PSM, the strong spins frozen
at higher temperature behaves as the “randomly pinned spins” in the sea of the mobile
weak spins at lower temperature. Indeed we can establish the precise relation between
these two models. To this end, we focus on the behaviors of weak spins in the limit of
J → 0 while keeping T /J constant. In this limit, the overlaps of strong spins become
q2 = 1, q1 = 1 and the breaking parameter m1 = 0. Plugging these limiting values into

The decoupling of the glass transitions in the two-component p-spin spherical model 15

G2RSB, equation (11), the relevant part for the weak spins becomes

This free energy is essentially equivalent to the one of the randomly pinned PSM §.
Thus the phase diagram of the two-component PSM converges to that of the randomly
pinned PSM in this limit.

5.2. Connection to the MCT of binary mixtures

We next discuss the implications of the two-component PSM for binary mixtures of
large and small particles with disparate size ratio. The MCT was recently used to
analyze the decoupling of the glass transitions of large and small particles in this model
and predicted the existence of four distinct glass phases [22]: (i) The “partially frozen
cageing” glass in which only the large particles are arrested due to the cageing eﬀect
amongst the large particles. In this phase, the small particles are left mobile and do not
qualitatively aﬀect the dynamics of large particles. (ii) The “partially frozen depletion-
driven” glass in which only the large particles are arrested by a short-ranged but strong
attractive interaction induced by the depletion eﬀect caused by small particles [35, 36].
In both the phases (i) and (ii), only the large particles undergo the glass transition
and the small particles play a role as the background solvent. The phase (i) is often
called the repulsive glass and (ii) is the attractive glass [37, 38, 39, 40]. (iii) The “fully
frozen” glass in which both the large and small particles are arrested simultaneously.
Both the large and small particles equally contribute to the formation of the frozen
states. (iv) The “torronchino” glass which is a subset of the “fully frozen” glass. In this
phase, however, the number of the small particles is much larger than that of the large
particles and the freezing is driven mainly by the small particles. By comparing the
glass phases in our model with those of the MCT, one ﬁnds that the “partially frozen
cageing” glass corresponds to the 1RSB(2) glass, the “fully frozen” to the 2RSB, and
the “torronchino” to the 1RSB(1). Because there is no depletion eﬀect in the present
model, there is no phase corresponding to the “partially frozen depletion-driven” glass.
At this stage however, one should realize a subtle but important diﬀerence between
the descriptions of the MCT and the replica theory for these phases. Speciﬁcally, we
revealed that the two-step replica symmetry breaking is needed to describe the 2RSB
glass or the “fully frozen” glass. However the MCT is believed to be a theory of the
1RSB dynamical transition [3, 4], therefore it cannot intrinsically describe this phase.

In order to consider the validity of the prediction of the MCT for the 2RSB glass
phase, it is useful to see how the 1RSB solution behaves in the 2RSB glass phase k.

§ Equation (12) becomes equivalent to equation (16) in Ref. [32], after dividing equation (16) by n,
taking carefully n → 0 limit and replacing p2, p1 and m1 with q1, q0 and m, respectively.
k More precisely, the MCT solution corresponds to the 1RSB solution optimized with leaving m1 = 1.
We also performed this calculation and veriﬁed that the results discussed below are qualitatively

In Figure 8, we plot the temperature dependence of the overlaps of the 1RSB solution

dynamical transition temperature T (1)
d but also at around the 2RSB dynamical transition
temperature T (2)
d . This means that though the 1RSB solution is incorrect in the 2RSB
glass region, it captures a signature of the transition into the 2RSB glass phase to
a certain extent. At c > 0.08, however, we do not ﬁnd any signature of the 2RSB
dynamical transition in the 1RSB solution. Indeed at c = 0.13 (Figure 8 right), q1 and
p1 increase only smoothly with decreasing temperature in the glass phase, while the
2RSB solution predicts the discontinuous 2RSB dynamical transition at T (2)
(Figure 5
lower left). In summary, the 1RSB solution can not correctly describe the 2RSB glass
phase although it can capture a trace of the 2RSB transition for a certain range of
parameters. This suggests that the applicability of the MCT to describe the decoupling
of the glass transitions in binary mixtures with disparate size ratio may be questioned.

6. Conclusions

In this work, we have introduced and studied a two-component version of the p-spin
spherical model. The model is composed of strongly interacting spins (strong spins) and
weakly interacting spins (weak spins), which mimic the glass forming binary mixtures
of large and small particles with disparate size ratio. We have found that when the
strengths of the interactions of the weak and strong spins are not widely separated,
the model has only one glass phase. This glass phase is the frozen state of both the
strong and weak spins and is described by the conventional 1RSB solution. On the
other hand when the strengths of the interactions are well separated, the model exhibits
the decoupling of the glass transitions of the weak and strong spins and, as a result,

unchanged.

The decoupling of the glass transitions in the two-component p-spin spherical model 17

there appear the three distinct glass phases. We referred to them as the 1RSB(1), the
1RSB(2), and the 2RSB glass phases. The 1RSB(1) glass phase appears in the region
where the number fraction of the strong spins is very small. This glass phase is the
frozen state of both the strong and weak spins, although the transition into this phase
is driven mainly by the freezing of the weak spins. The 1RSB(2) glass phase appears in
the region where the number fraction of the strong spins is large. In this glass phase,
only the strong spins are frozen while the weak spins are left mobile. By cooling the
1RSB(2) glass further, the 2RSB glass phase is obtained, in which the weak spins are
also frozen. The 2RSB glass phase is characterized by the two-step hierarchical structure
of the free energy landscape. The 2RSB glass transition becomes ether discontinuous
or continuous depending on the number fraction of the strong spins. The discontinuous
2RSB thermodynamic transition is accompanied with the jump of the second order
derivative of the free energy, namely the heat capacity. On the other hand, for the
continuous 2RSB thermodynamic transition, the heat capacity changes continuously
while the third order derivative of the free energy jumps discontinuously. Based on the
results, we have discussed the connection of the present model to the randomly pinned
PSM. The phase diagram of the present model appears to be similar to that of the
randomly pinned PSM. We have analytically showed that the free energy of the two-
component PSM becomes exactly identical to that of the randomly pinned PSM in the
small limit of the ratio between the strengths of the interactions of the weak and strong
spins. We have also discussed the implications of the present results for the MCT for
binary mixtures of large and small particles with disparate size ratio. We have found
that the 1RSB solution can not correctly describe the 2RSB glass phase although it
can capture a trace of the 2RSB transitions for a certain range of parameters, which
may leave questionable the applicability of the MCT to describe the decoupling of the
glass transitions in binary mixtures with disparate size ratio. Regarding this point, it
is interesting to extend the replicated liquid state theory [41, 42] to allow the 2RSB
ansatz [43] to describe the decoupling of the glass transitions in binary mixtures with
disparate size ratio. Study along this direction is under way [44].

From this expression,
it is clear that the value of m2 is independent from the
normalization constants of the eigen vectors, equation (A.9) and equation (A.11). The
right hand side of equation (A.12) is the function of q, p, and T . Substituting the 1RSB
results into q and p and T (2c)
K calculated by equation (A.6) into T , we obtain the value
of m2.

An advantage of the formalism constructed above is that one can evaluate T (2c)
and the value of m2 at the transition point with only the information about the 1RSB

result. This enables a more precise investigation of the phase behavior than that of
the full numerical minimization of G2RSB. In Figure A1, we compare T (2c)
K calculated
by equation (A.6) with that calculated by the minimization of G2RSB (as in Figure. 4).
They are almost identical.

To determine the critical point at which the continuous transition ceases to exist
and the transition becomes discontinuous, one should observe the value of m2(c). In
Figure A2, we show the c dependence of m2(c) calculated by equation (A.12) on T (2c)
K (c).
The value of m2 increases with decreasing c and reaches m2 = 1 at the critical point
cc= 0.17174, where T (2c)
K (cc) = Tc = 0.021667. Note that m2 = 1 is a signal of the
discontinuous transition, therefore it is natural to guess that at c = cc, the continuous
2RSB thermodynamic transition line, T (2c)
K (c), is connected to the discontinuous 2RSB
thermodynamic and dynamical transition lines, T (2)
K (c). This assumption
is indeed correct, see Figure 4.
