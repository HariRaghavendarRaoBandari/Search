BETA-EXPANSION AND CONTINUED FRACTION EXPANSION

OF REAL NUMBERS

LULU FANG, MIN WU AND BING LI∗

Abstract. Let β > 1 be a real number and x ∈ [0, 1) be an irrational number.
We denote by kn(x) the exact number of partial quotients in the continued
fraction expansion of x given by the ﬁrst n digits in the β-expansion of x
It is known that kn(x)/n converges to (6 log 2 log β)/π2 almost
(n ∈ N).
everywhere in the sense of Lebesgue measure. In this paper, we improve this
result by proving that the Lebesgue measure of the set of x ∈ [0, 1) for which
kn(x)/n deviates away from (6 log 2 log β)/π2 decays to 0 exponentially as n
tends to ∞, which generalizes the result of Faivre [8] from β = 10 to any
β > 1. Moreover, we also discuss which of the β-expansion and continued
fraction expansion yields the better approximations of real numbers.

1. Introduction

Let β > 1 be a real number and Tβ : [0, 1) −→ [0, 1) be the β-transformation

deﬁned as

where [x] denotes the greatest integer not exceeding x. Then every x ∈ [0, 1) can
be uniquely expanded into a ﬁnite or inﬁnite series, i.e.,

Tβ(x) = βx − [βx],

x =

(1.1)

where ε1(x) = [βx] and εn+1(x) = ε1(T n
β x) for all n ≥ 1. We call the representation
(1.1) the β-expansion of x denoted by (ε1(x), ε2(x),··· , εn(x),··· ) and εn(x), n ≥ 1
the digits of the β-expansion of x. Such an expansion was ﬁrst introduced by R´enyi
[26], who proved that there exists a unique Tβ-invariant measure µ equivalent to
the Lebesgue measure λ. More precisely,

C −1λ(A) ≤ µ(A) ≤ Cλ(A)

(1.2)
for any Borel set A ⊆ [0, 1), where C > 1 is a constant only depending on β.
Furthermore, Gel’fond [14] and Parry [23] independently found the density formula
for this invariant measure with respect to (w.r.t.) the Lebesgue measure. Philipp
[24] showed that the dynamical system ([0, 1),B, Tβ, µ) is an exponentially strong
mixing measure-preserving system, where B is the Borel σ-algebra on [0, 1). Later,
Hofbauer [15] proved that µ is the unique measure of maximal entropy for Tβ. Some
arithmetic and metric properties of β-expansion were studied in the literature, such
as [1, 3, 4, 7, 12, 19, 27, 28] and the references therein.

Now we turn to introducing continued fractions. Let T : [0, 1) −→ [0, 1) be the

Gauss transformation given by

T (0) := 0 and T (x) := 1/x − [1/x]

if x ∈ (0, 1).

Then any irrational number x ∈ [0, 1) can be written as

x =

a1(x) +

. . . +

a2(x) +

an(x) +

. . .

,

(1.3)

where a1(x) = [1/x] and an+1(x) = a1(T nx) for all n ≥ 1. The form (1.3) is
said to be the continued fraction expansion of x and an(x), n ≥ 1 are called the
partial quotients of the continued fraction expansion of x. Sometimes we write the
form (1.3) as [a1(x), a2(x),··· , an(x),··· ]. For any n ≥ 1, we denote by pn(x)
qn(x) :=
[a1(x), a2(x),··· , an(x)] the n-th convergent of the continued fraction expansion of
x, where pn(x) and qn(x) are relatively prime. Clearly these convergents are rational
numbers and pn(x)/qn(x) → x as n → ∞ for all x ∈ [0, 1). For more details about
continued fractions, we refer the reader to a monograph of Khintchine [18].
A natural question is whether there exists some relationship between diﬀerent
expansions of some real number, for instance, its β-expansion and continued fraction
expansion. For any irrational number x ∈ [0, 1) and n ≥ 1, we denote by kn(x) the
exact number of partial quotients in the continued fraction expansion of x given by
the ﬁrst n digits in the β-expansion of x. In other words,

kn(x) = sup{m ≥ 0 : J(ε1(x),··· , εn(x)) ⊆ I(a1(x),··· , am(x))} ,

where J(ε1(x),··· , εn(x)) and I(a1(x),··· , am(x)) are called the cylinders of β-
expansion and continued fraction expansion respectively (see Section 2 for the def-
inition of the cylinder). It is easy to check that
0 ≤ k1(x) ≤ k2(x) ≤ ··· and

kn(x) = ∞.

n→∞

The quantity kn(x) was ﬁrst introduced by Lochs [21] for β = 10 and has been
extensively studied by many mathematicians, see [2, 8, 9, 13, 20, 29, 30]. Applying
the result of Dajani and Fieldsteel [6] (Theorem 5) to β-expansion and continued
fraction expansion, Li and Wu [20] obtained a metric result of {kn, n ≥ 1}, that is,
for λ-almost all x ∈ [0, 1),

The formula (1.4) has been stated for β = 10 by a pioneering result of Lochs [21].
Barreira and Iommi [2] proved that the irregular set of points x ∈ [0, 1) for which
the limit in (1.4) does not exist has full Hausdorﬀ dimension. Li and Wu [20]
gave some asymptotic results of kn(x)/n for any irrational x ∈ [0, 1) not just a
kind of almost all result (see also Wu [29]). For the special case β = 10, some
limit theorems of {kn, n ≥ 1} were studied in the earlier literature. For instance,
using Ruelle-Mayer operator, Faivre [8] showed an error term: for positive ε the
Lebesgue measure of the set of x’s for which kn(x)/n is more than ε away from
(6 log 2 log 10)/π2 tends geometrically to zero. Later, he also proved a central limit
theorem for the sequence {kn, n ≥ 1} in [9]. The law of the iterated logarithm for
the sequence {kn, n ≥ 1} was established by Wu [30].

We wonder if the similar limit theorems of the sequence {kn, n ≥ 1} are still
valid for general β > 1. It is worth pointing out that the lengths of cylinders play
an important role in the study of β-expansion (see [5, 12]). The methods of Faivre
(see [8, 9]) and Wu (see [29, 30]) rely heavily on the length of a cylinder for β = 10.
Indeed, the n-th cylinder is a regular interval and its length equals always to 10−n
for β = 10. For the general case β > 1, it is well-known that the n-th cylinder is
a left-closed and right-open interval and its length has an absolute upper bound
β−n. Fan and Wang [12] obtained that the growth of the lengths of cylinders is
multifractal and that the multifractal spectrum depends on β. However, for some
“bad” β > 1, the n-th cylinder is irregular and there is no nontrivial absolute
lower bound for its length, which can be much smaller than β−n. This is the
main diﬃculty we met. In fact, the authors have established a lower bound (not
necessarily absolute) of the length of a cylinder (see [13, Proposition 2.3]) and
obtained the central limit theorem and law of the iterated logarithm of {kn, n ≥ 1}
for any β > 1 in [13]. In the present paper, we make use of this lower bound to
extend the result of Faivre [8] from β = 10 to any β > 1, which indicates that the
Lebesgue measure of the set of x ∈ [0, 1) for which kn(x)/n deviates away from
(6 log 2 log β)/π2 tends to 0 exponentially as n goes to ∞.
Theorem 1.1. Let β > 1 be a real number. For any ε > 0, there exist two positive
constants A and α (both depending on β and ε) such that for all n ≥ 1,

Remark 1.2. The above theorem immediately yields that for all ε > 0,

That is, kn(x)/n converges completely to (6 log 2 log β)/π2 (the deﬁnition of the
complete convergence see [16]). This kind of convergence is stronger than almost
everywhere convergence and sometimes more convenient to establish. By Borel-
Cantelli lemma, we easily obtain the limit (1.4) for λ-almost all x ∈ [0, 1).

For any x ∈ [0, 1), we denote the partial sums of the form (1.1) by

xn =

ε1(x)

β

ε2(x)
β2 + ··· +

εn(x)

and call them the convergents of the β-expansion of x. It is clear that the sequence
{xn, n ≥ 1} converges to x as n → ∞ for all x ∈ [0, 1). If x − xn > |x − pn/qn|,
we say that the approximation of x by pn/qn is better than the approximation by
xn (n ∈ N). The formula (1.4) implies that for λ-almost all x ∈ [0, 1), the larger
β is (that is, the more symbols we use to code number x), the more information
about the continued fraction expansion we can obtained from its β-expansion. In
other words, for suﬃcient large β > 1, the approximation of a real number by β-
expansion is better than the approximation by continued fractions. More precisely,
we show that the Lebesgue measure of the set for which the ﬁrst n partial quotients
of continued fraction expansion provide a better approximation for x than the
ﬁrst n digits of β-expansion decreases to 0 geometrically as n tends to ∞ if log β >
π2/(6 log 2) and the case is converse when log β < π2/(6 log 2). Besides, we can also

see that the decay rates are related to the multifractal analysis for the Lyapunov
exponent of the Gauss transformation (see Remark 3.6).

Remark 1.5. Since log 10 < π2/(6 log 2), we know that the approximation of some
real number by decimal expansion (i.e., β = 10) is not better than the approxi-
mation by continued fraction expansion in the view of almost everywhere. This
result was obtained by Faivre [8] in 1997. However, for the critical value β =
exp(π2/(6 log 2)) ≈ 10.731, our methods are invalid and we do not know which is
the better approximation by β-expansion and continued fraction expansion.

2. Preliminary

This section is devoted to recalling some deﬁnitions and basic properties of the

β-expansion and continued fraction expansion.

2.1. β-expansions. We ﬁrst state some notions and basic properties of β-expansion.
Deﬁnition 2.1. An n-block (ε1, ε2,··· , εn) is said to be admissible for β-expansions
if there exists x ∈ [0, 1) such that εi(x) = εi for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. An inﬁnite sequence
(ε1, ε2,··· , εn,··· ) is admissible if (ε1, ε2,··· , εn) is admissible for all n ≥ 1.

We denote by Σn

β the collection of all admissible sequences of length n. The
following result of R´enyi [26] implies that the dynamical system ([0,1), Tβ) admits
log β as its topological entropy.
Proposition 2.1 ([26]). Let β > 1. For any n ≥ 1,

β ≤ βn+1/(β − 1),
where ♯ denotes the number of elements of a ﬁnite set.

βn ≤ ♯Σn

BETA-EXPANSION AND CONTINUED FRACTION EXPANSION

Deﬁnition 2.2. Let (ε1, ε2,··· , εn) ∈ Σn

β. We deﬁne

J(ε1, ε2,··· , εn) = {x ∈ [0, 1) : εi(x) = εi for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n}

and call it the n-th cylinder of β-expansion. In other words, it is the set of points
beginning with (ε1, ε2,··· , εn) in their β-expansions. For any real number x ∈
[0, 1), J(ε1(x), ε2(x),··· , εn(x)) is said to be the n-th cylinder containing x.
Remark 2.3. The cylinder J(ε1, ε2,··· , εn) is a left-closed and right-open interval
with left endpoint

ε1
β

+

ε2
β2 + ··· +

εn
βn .

Moreover, the length of J(ε1, ε2,··· , εn) satisﬁes |J(ε1, ε2,··· , εn)| ≤ 1/βn.

For any x ∈ [0, 1) and n ≥ 1, we assume that (ε1(x), ε2(x),··· , εn(x),··· ) is the

β-expansion of x and deﬁne

ln(x) = sup{k ≥ 0 : εn+j(x) = 0 for all 1 ≤ j ≤ k} .

(2.1)

That is, the length of the longest string of zeros just after the n-th digit in the
β-expansion of x. The following proposition gives a lower bound, which is not
absolute and related to ln(x).
Proposition 2.2 ([13]). Let β > 1. Then for any x ∈ [0, 1) and n ≥ 1,

1

βn+ln(x)+1 ≤ |J(ε1(x), ε2(x),··· , εn(x))| ≤

βn ,

where ln(x) is deﬁned as (2.1).
Proof. For any x ∈ [0, 1) and n ≥ 1, we know that J(ε1(x), ε2(x),··· , εn(x)) is a
left-closed and right-open interval with left endpoint

ωn(x) :=

ε1(x)

+

ε2(x)
β2 + ··· +

εn(x)

and its length satisﬁes |J(ε1(x), ε2(x),··· , εn(x))| ≤ 1/βn.

Since x ∈ J(ε1(x), ε2(x),··· , εn(x)), we have that

β

1

βn+ln(x)+1 ≤ x − ωn(x) ≤ |J(ε1(x), ε2(x),··· , εn(x))|,

where the ﬁrst inequality follows from εn+1(x) = ··· = εn+ln(x)(x) = 0 and
εn+ln(x)+1(x) ≥ 1 by the deﬁnition of ln(x) in (2.1). This completes the proof. (cid:3)
2.2. Continued fractions. Let us now introduce some elementary properties of
continued fractions. For any irrational number x ∈ [0, 1) and n ≥ 1, with the
conventions p−1 = 1, q−1 = 0, p0 = 0, q0 = 1, the quantities pn and qn satisfy the
following recursive formula:

pn(x) = an(x)pn−1(x) + pn−2(x)

and qn(x) = an(x)qn−1(x) + qn−2(x).

(2.2)

By the above recursive formula of pn and qn, we can easily obtain that

pn(x)

qn(x)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤

(2.3)

This is to say that the speed of pn(x)/qn(x) approximating to x is dominated by
q−2
n (x). So the denominator of the n-th convergent qn(x) plays an important role
in the problem of Diophantine approximation.

6

LULU FANG, MIN WU AND BING LI∗

Deﬁnition 2.4. For any n ≥ 1 and a1, a2,··· , an ∈ N, we call

I(a1,··· , an) := {x ∈ [0, 1) : a1(x) = a1,··· , an(x) = an}

the n-th cylinder of continued fraction expansion. For any real number x ∈ [0, 1),
I(a1(x), a2(x),··· , an(x)) is said to be the n-th cylinder containing x.

The following proposition is about the structure and length of cylinders.

Proposition 2.3 ([7]). Let a1, a2,··· , an ∈ N. Then I(a1,··· , an) is an interval
with two endpoints

where pn and qn satisfy the recursive formula (2.2).

3. Proofs of theorems

In the following, we denote by I the set of all irrational numbers in [0, 1) and
use the notation E(ξ) to denote the expectation of a random variable ξ w.r.t. the
Lebesgue measure λ. For any θ > 1/2, we deﬁne the so called Diophantine pressure
function (see Kesseb¨ohmer and Stratmann [17]) as

P(θ) := lim
n→∞

([a1,··· , an]).

Kesseb¨ohmer and Stratmann [17] proved that the Diophantine pressure function
has a singularity at 1/2 and is decreasing, convex and real-analytic on (1/2, +∞)
satisfying

P(1) = 0

and P′(1) = −π2/(6 log 2).

(3.1)

Furthermore, they also studied the multifractal analysis for the Lyapunov exponent
of the Gauss transformation T by using this function (see also Pollicott and Weiss
[25] and Fan et al. [10] and [11]). More detailed analysis of this function can be
founded in Mayer [22]. The following lemma establishes the relation between this
function and the growth of the expectation of qn, which plays an important role in
our proofs.

Lemma 3.1. For any θ < 1/2,

3.1. Proof of Theorem 1.1. Recall that

kn(x) = sup{m ≥ 0 : J(ε1(x),··· , εn(x)) ⊆ I(a1(x),··· , am(x))} ,

we have the following lemma.
Lemma 3.2. Let m ≥ 1 be an integer. Then

{x ∈ I : kn(x) ≥ m} = {x ∈ I : J(ε1(x),··· , εn(x)) ⊆ I(a1(x),··· , am(x))} .
To prove Theorem 1.1, we will show a stronger result.

Proposition 3.1. Let a = (6 log 2 log β)/π2. Then for any ε > 0,

Remark 3.3. By the domain of the function P(·), we ﬁrst remark that the quantities
θ1(ε) and θ2(ε) can be rewritten as

θ1(ε) = inf

t + 1(cid:16)t log β + (a + ε)P(t + 1)(cid:17)(cid:27)
t<1/2(cid:8) − t log β + (a − ε)P(1 − t)(cid:9).

θ2(ε) = inf

In fact, for any ε > 0, we deﬁne f (t) = t log β + (a + ε)P(t + 1) for all −1/2 < t ≤ 0
and g(t) = −t log β + (a − ε)P(1 − t) for all t ≤ 0. Moreover, we actually obtained
that f (t) ≥ 0 and g(t) ≥ 0. Since P(·) is convex and real-analytic on (1/2, +∞),
we know that P ′(t + 1) ≤ P ′(1) for any −1/2 < t ≤ 0 and P ′(1 − t) ≥ P ′(1) for
any t ≤ 0. It follows from (3.1) that

f ′(t) = log β + (a + ε)P ′(t + 1) ≤ log β + (a + ε)P ′(1) = −επ2/(6 log 2) < 0

for any −1/2 < t ≤ 0 and
g′(t) = − log β − (a − ε)P ′(1 − t) ≤ − log β − (a − ε)P ′(1) = −επ2/(6 log 2) < 0

8

LULU FANG, MIN WU AND BING LI∗

for any t ≤ 0. Therefore, f is decreasing on (−1/2, 0] and g is decreasing on
(−∞, 0]. In view of (3.1), we obtain that f (t) ≥ f (0) = 0 when −1/2 < t ≤ 0
and g(t) ≥ g(0) = 0 if t ≤ 0. Thus, θ1(ε) and θ2(ε) are established by the above
formulas. Next we give a little more information about θ1(ε). That is,

θ1(ε) ≥ inf

t>−1/2(cid:8)t log β + (a + ε)P(t + 1)(cid:9).

In fact, it is easy to check that θ1(ε) ≥ inf t>0(cid:8)t log β + (a + ε)P(t + 1)(cid:9) since they
are both negative. Moreover, the ﬁrst remark has indicated that the infmum can
take over all t > −1/2.

The following is a key lemma in the proof of the inequality (3.3).

Lemma 3.4. Let β > 1 be a real number and i ≥ 0 be an integer. Then for any

Now we are going to give the proof of (3.3).

Proof of (3.3). For any x ∈ [0, 1) and n ≥ 1, Proposition 2.2 shows that

|J(ε1(x), ε2(x),··· , εn(x))| ≥

βn+ln(x)+1 ,

where ln(x) is deﬁned as (2.1). Let m ≥ 1 be an integer.

this with (3.5), we obtain that

(3.7)

For any ε > 0 and n ≥ 1, let mn = [n(a + ε)]. Then mn → ∞, mn/n ≤ a + ε
and mn/n → a + ε as n → ∞. So, there exists a positive number N (depending
on η and ε) such that for all n ≥ N , we have that mn ≥ M . Fixed such n ≥ N , it
follows from (3.7) that

λ(cid:8)x ∈ I : kn(x) ≥ mn(cid:9) ≤ Cβδ +

Now we choose a suitable δ > 0 such that f (δ) = Cβδ + δ−tβt(n+1)emn(P(t+1)+η)

we calculate that δ =(cid:16)C −1

θ1(ε) = inf

Now it remains to prove that θ1(ε) < 0. Let h(ω) be the function deﬁned as

h(ω) = ω log β + (a + ε)P(ω + 1)

for all ω > −1/2.

It is clear to see h is real-analytic on (−1/2, +∞) since the pressure function P(·)
is real-analytic. By the properties of P(·) in (3.1), we know that h(0) = 0 and
h′(0) = −π2ε/(6 log 2) < 0. Hence there exists t0 > 0 such that h(t0) < 0 by the
deﬁnition of derivative. Thus, θ1(ε) ≤ h(t0) < 0.

(cid:3)

To prove the inequality (3.4), we need the following lemma whose proof is inspired

by Wu [29] (see also Li and Wu [20]).
Lemma 3.5. Let n ≥ 1, i ≥ 1 be integers and x ∈ [0, 1) be an irrational number
such that J(ε1(x),··· , εn(x)) 6⊆ I(a1(x),··· , ai+1(x)). Then

i+3(x) ≤ |J(ε1(x),··· , εn(x))| ≤

6q2

Proof. Since J(ε1(x),··· , εn(x)) 6⊆ I(a1(x),··· , ai+1(x)), we know that at least one
endpoint of J(ε1(x),··· , εn(x)) does not belong to I(a1(x),··· , ai+1(x)). Without
loss of generality, we assume that the right endpoint of J(ε1(x),··· , εn(x)) does
not belong to I(a1(x),··· , ai+1(x)), i.e., the right endpoint of I(a1(x),··· , ai+1(x))
belongs to J(ε1(x),··· , εn(x)).
Case I. If i is even, we know that I(a1(x),··· , ai+1(x)) is decomposed into a count-
able (i + 2)-th cylinders like I(a1(x),··· , ai+1(x), j) (j ∈ N) and these cylinders
I(a1(x),··· , ai+1(x), 1), I(a1(x),··· , ai+1(x), 2),··· run from left to right. Since
x ∈ J(ε1(x),··· , εn(x))T I(a1(x),··· , ai+1(x), ai+2(x)), we have that
I(a1(x),··· , ai+1(x), ai+2(x) + 1) ⊆ J(ε1(x),··· , εn(x)).

BETA-EXPANSION AND CONTINUED FRACTION EXPANSION

By (2.2) and (2.4), we deduce that

Case II. If i is odd, we consider the (i+2)-th cylinder I(a1(x),··· , ai+1(x), ai+2(x)).
We know that I(a1(x),··· , ai+1(x), ai+2(x)) can be decomposed into a countable
(i + 3)-th cylinders like I(a1(x),··· , ai+1(x), ai+2(x), j) (j ∈ N) and these cylinders
I(a1(x),··· , ai+1(x), ai+2(x), 1), I(a1(x),··· , ai+1(x), ai+2(x), 2),··· also run from
left to right. Notice that x ∈ J(ε1(x),··· , εn(x))T I(a1(x),··· , ai+2(x), ai+3(x)),
we obtain that I(a1(x),··· , ai+1(x), ai+3(x) + 1) ⊆ J(ε1(x),··· , εn(x)). Therefore,

For any 0 < ε < a and n ≥ 1, let mn = [n(a− ε)]+ 1. Then mn → ∞, mn/n ≥ a− ε

η and ε) such that for all n ≥ N , we have that mn ≥ M . Now we ﬁx such n ≥ N ,
in view of (3.10), we deduce that

h(ω) = −ω log β + (a − ε) log P(1 − ω).

Now we need to show that θ2(ε) < 0. For any ω < 1/2, we consider the function

Then it is easy to check that h is real-analytic on (−∞, 1/2) and satisﬁes h(0) = 0
and h′(0) = −π2ε/(6 log 2) < 0 because of the properties of P(·) in (3.1). So, if
t > 0 suﬃciently close to 0, we obtain that θ2(ε) < 0.

real α (only depending on β and ε) and positive integer N such that for all n > N ,
we have

(3.11)

For all 1 ≤ n ≤ N , since the probabilities of the left-hand side in (3.11) are bounded,
we can choose suﬃciently large A (only depending on β and ε) such that

θ∗ = inf

Besides, we can also give more remarks on θ and θ∗, which indicates that θ and
θ∗ are related to the multifractal analysis for the Lyapunov exponent of the Gauss
transformation. Recall that Kesseb¨ohmer and Stratmann [17, Theorem 1.3] (see
also Fan et al. [10]) proved that

τ (γ) := dimH {x ∈ [0, 1) : L(x) = γ} =

inf t∈R{t · γ + P(t)}

γ

for any γ ≥ 2 log((√5 + 1)/2), where dimH denotes the Hausdorﬀ dimension and
L(x) is the Lyapunov exponent of the Gauss transformation T deﬁned as

L(x) := lim

n→∞

log |(T n)′(x)|,

1
n

if the limit exists. Since log β > π2/(6 log 2) > 2 log((√5 + 1)/2), a simple calcula-
tion implies that the constant θ have an alternative form

It is not diﬃcult to check that

θ = (τ (log β) − 1) log β.

θ∗ ≥ inf

t>−1/2(cid:8)t log β + P(t + 1)(cid:9) = (τ (log β) − 1) log β,

where the last equality only holds for log β ≥ 2 log((√5 + 1)/2). By Theorem
1.3 of Kesseb¨ohmer and Stratmann [17] (see also Theorem 1.3 of Fan et al. [10]),
we know that −(log β)/2 < θ < 0 for log β > π2/(6 log 2) and θ∗ ≥ − log β for
log β ≥ 2 log((√5 + 1)/2). This is one way to show θ is negative and also gives the
lower bounds for θ and θ∗.

We ﬁrst give the proof of the inequality (3.12).

Combining these with (3.14) and (3.15), we deduce that

The condition log β < π2/(6 log 2) guarantees that θ∗ < 0 by the similar techniques
at the end of the proof of (3.3).

At last, we are ready to prove Theorem 1.3.

Proof of Theorem 1.3. In view of Proposition 3.2, the similar methods of the proof
of Theorem 1.1 give the proofs of (i) and (ii) in Theorem 1.3.
