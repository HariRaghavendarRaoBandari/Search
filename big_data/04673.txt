ABSTRACT

Aims. We aim studying the use of cross-correlation techniques to infer the frequency shifts induced by changing magnetic ﬁelds in
the p-mode frequencies and provide precise estimation of the error bars.
Methods.This technique and the calculation of the associated errors is ﬁrst tested and validated on the Sun where the p-mode magnetic
behaviour is very well known. These validation tests are performed on 6000-day time series of Sun-as-a-star observations delivered
by the SoHO spacecraft. Errors of the frequency shifts are quantiﬁed through Monte Carlo simulations. The same methodology is
then applied to three solar-like oscillating stars: HD 49933, observed by CoRoT, as well as KIC 3733735 and KIC 7940546 observed
by Kepler.
Results. We ﬁrst demonstrate the reliability of the error bars computed with the Monte Carlo simulations using the Sun. From the
three analyzed stars we conﬁrm the presence of a magnetic activity cycle with this methodology in HD 49933 and we unveil seismic
signature of on going magnetic variations in KIC 3733735. Finally, the third star, KIC 7940546, seems to be in a quiet regime.

1. Introduction

The ultra-high precision photometric time series obtained with
satellites such as CoRoT (Convection Rotation and planetary
Transits, Baglin et al. 2006) and Kepler (Borucki et al. 2010) has
opened a new window in the study of magnetic activity cycles
in solar-like pulsating stars (e.g. Mathur et al. 2013b, 2014a,b).
The active regions crossing the visible surface of a star produce
a modulation in the observed light curve that provides infor-
mation about the rotation rate and the stellar magnetic activity
(e.g. Garc´ıa et al. 2014). Moreover, it is even possible to detect
magnetic frequency shifts of the acoustic modes along the ac-
tivity cycle (Garc´ıa et al. 2010) as it is commonly done for the
Sun (e.g. Woodard & Noyes 1985; Anguera Gubau et al. 1992;
Chaplin et al. 2001).

To study the temporal evolution of the p-mode frequency
shifts, it is necessary to extract reliable p-mode frequencies of
individual modes during short periods of time, typically 30 to
60 days. This could be a big challenge in asteroseismology, es-
pecially when changes of about a few µHz are expected and the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) could be small. An alternative way
consists in computing average frequency shifts by using cross-
correlation techniques. This method was ﬁrst successfully used
in the Sun with single site observations (e.g. Pall´e et al. 1989).
With the arrival of long time series of hundreds of solar-like stars
from space missions, the cross-correlation method may help us
again in the study of magnetic activity cycles. Thanks to this
technique, obtaining frequencies of individual p modes in short
time series – which requires high SNR – is not needed. Instead,
the cross-correlation of the full (or part) p-mode power excess

(the frequency range in which the power of the modes is found)
of each subseries and a reference spectrum can be computed pro-
viding the average shift of the acoustic modes during the ana-
lyzed time span.

A problem in the use of the cross-correlation methods could
be the way in which the individual uncertainties are computed.
In previous works in which this technique has been used, these
uncertainties were obtained as the statistical error of the ﬁt
of a Gaussian function to the cross-correlation proﬁle (e.g.
Pall´e et al. 1989; Garc´ıa et al. 2010; Mathur et al. 2013b). This
ﬁt is the way to determine the average frequency shift between
two diﬀerent periods of time. Such errors underestimate total er-
rors since systematic and model errors are neglected. To better
quantify the errors, we propose in the present work to use Monte
Carlo simulation. We analyze the limit of the methodology using
6000 days of solar data obtained with the blue channel of the so-
lar photometer of VIRGO instrument (Fr¨ohlich et al. 1995) on-
board the SoHO spacecraft (Domingo et al. 1995).

The method is applied to three solar-like stars: one from
CoRoT, HD 49933, and two from Kepler, KIC 3733735 and
KIC 7940546. It is well known that the ﬁrst two stars have on-
going magnetic cycles (Garc´ıa et al. 2010; Mathur et al. 2014a)
while the third star, KIC 7940546, does not show any signiﬁcant
variation in the light curve which could be a consequence of a
low inclination angle or because the star is in a quiet magnetic
state.

The layout of the paper is as follows. In section 2 we will
explain the methodology used. In section 3 the method is val-
idated using 6000-day time series of Sun-as-a-star observation.

In section 4 three solar-like stars, one from CoRoT and two from
Kepler satellite are analysed. The last section is devoted to dis-
cussion and conclusion.

the width of the modes. For doing so we divided the time series
into independent subseries (without any overlap) of 30, 60, 90,
120, 180, 240, 300 and 365 days. An example of the resultant
frequency shifts using 60 and 365 days subseries is shown in
Fig. 1.

We use the cross-correlation technique to measure p-mode fre-
quency shifts. To use this method, we ﬁrst divide the whole light
curve of the analysed stars into shorter subseries that can over-
lap or not. The size of each chunk depends on the overall length
of the observations, the quality of the data, and the length of the
activity cycle we want to investigate. According to these restric-
tions, we have used series between 30 and 180 days for the three
analysed solar-like stars. For the Sun we use longer subseries
–up to a year– because we have more than 16 years of observa-
tions and because the solar magnetic cycle is long (eleven years
in average from maximum to maximum). The power spectrum
of each subseries is computed.

Then, each one is cross-correlated with a reference spectrum
deﬁned as the average of all the individual spectra. The proﬁle
of the cross-correlation function has almost a Gaussian shape.
Therefore, a Gaussian function is ﬁtted to each cross-correlation
function. The position of the maximum is considered as the av-
erage shift of the p-mode frequencies present in the range of the
spectrum used in the analysis.

To obtain the error bars of the cross-correlation analysis we

follow the following steps:

1 - At high frequencies, well above the p-mode region where
the spectrum is dominated by the photon noise, the standard de-
viation of this noise is obtained for both spectra, the reference
one and the target one.

2 - The absolute diﬀerence between the standard deviations
of the target spectrum and the reference one is added to the later
in order to have both spectrum with the same noise level.

3 - The reference spectrum with the new level of white noise

is shifted by the computed shift (if any).

4 - We produce one hundred simulated power spectrum by
multiplying the reference shifted spectrum by a random noise
distribution following a χ

2 with 2 degrees of freedom.

5 - Each of these simulated spectra is cross-correlated with

the original reference one to obtain a new frequency shift.

6 - The standard deviation of all the obtained displacements
of the simulated spectra with respect to the real one is considered
the error of the measure.

We have veriﬁed that the results are unbiased by comparing
the mean extracted values to the expected one. We have also
veriﬁed that using an averaged spectrum as a reference spectrum
is not introducing signiﬁcant biases. Moreover, we checked that
a higher number of simulated realizations (e.g. 500 or 1000) does
not change the ﬁnal result. Therefore we have decided to use 100
realizations to reduce the computation time.

3. Validation: application to the Sun

To study the behaviour and the limits of the cross-correlation
analysis as well as the error estimation we use the Sun as a ref-
erence. Time series of 6000 days cadenced at 60 s –from April
11th 1996 to September 14th 2012– are used in this analysis al-
most covering one and half solar magnetic cycle. Solar observa-
tions were obtained by the blue channel of the Sun Photometers
of the VIRGO instrument onboard the SoHO spacecraft. With
these observations we study the behaviour of the method attend-
ing the range of p-mode frequencies used, the length of the sub-
series, the inﬂuence of a pre-smooth of the spectra, the SNR, and

Fig. 1. Frequency shifts along the solar cycle using subseries of
60 (open triangles) and 365 days (full circles). The error bars
have been obtained using Monte Carlo simulations following the
methodology described in this work. Starting on April 11th 1996.

As a ﬁrst step, we checked that the computation of the er-
rors are unbiased by calculating a histogram of the diﬀerence
between the expected shift (νexp) and the measured shifts (νmed)
in the Monte Carlo simulations. This is done for series of 365
days and the results are shown in Fig. 2 for 100, 500 and 1000
realizations. As we expect from an unbiased computation, the
histograms are well ﬁtted by a Gaussian proﬁle centred in zero.
In our case, the small deviation from zero that the Gaussian pro-
ﬁles shown is 0.003 µHz, inside the dispersion of 0.005 µHz
obtained from the errors associated to the frequency shifts cal-
culated from the series of 365 days.

To verify that using an averaged spectrum as a reference
spectrum is not introducing signiﬁcant biases, we create a syn-
thetic limit spectrum miming the solar spectra observed by
VIRGO within the range 2000–4000 µHz. It includes a back-
ground and modes of degree l = 0 to 3. We consider two spec-
tral resolutions corresponding to 60-day- and 365-day-long ob-
servations. For each resolution, we generate 100 synthetic ob-
servations by multiplying the limit spectrum by a random noise
2 with 2 degrees of freedom. Then, we
distribution following a χ
consider sequences of 100, 50, 20, 10, 5 or even 2 independent
observations. Each sequence is analysed with the previously de-
scribed technique (measurement of the shift – expected to be
zero – and of the error bar). We compare the results obtained
by using directly the limit spectrum as a reference instead of an
average spectrum. We don’t see any signiﬁcant diﬀerence. Only
when the number of spectra in the sequence is small (2 or 5),
we see two marginal eﬀects: a slight bias of the determined shift
towards zero and a slight increase of the estimated error bars.
However, these eﬀects are weak compared to the errors them-
selves.

After that, we start analyzing the behaviour of the computed
errors depending on the length of the subseries following the
method explained in the previous section. In Fig. 3 it is shown
the average errors and their dispersions (σerror) as a function of

the length of the subseries. The frequency shifts were computed
using a range of ± 600 µHz centered at 3000 µHz and without
smoothing the spectra. The errors decrease with the increase of
the length of subseries T . It varies as T −0.65±0.14 which is almost
compatible with a squared-root decay.

Fig. 3. Mean errors and associated dispersions (σerror) of the fre-
quency shifts as a function of the length of the subseries.

The fact of using this range of ± 600 µHz is because it is
a good compromise between the size and dispersion of the ob-
tained errors, as it can be seen in Fig. 4. Indeed, diﬀerent ranges
of p modes centred at 3000 µHz: ± 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, and
1200 µHz have been compared. Two sets of results were plotted.
Triangles correspond to the results obtained when white noise is
added to the time series to reproduce noisy data with a SNR three
times lower than the original (SNR=1.1). The SNR is estimated
as the mean value of the ratio between the mode amplitude in the
power spectra and the ﬁtted background in the analyzed range.
Circles correspond to the original signal (SNR = 3.3). Although
the results are quite similar, smaller errors are obtained when a
range of ± 600 µHz around the central frequency of 3000 µHz is
used.

Fig. 4. Average errors and associated dispersions of the fre-
quency shifts using series of 365 days and diﬀerent ranges of
p modes. Triangles correspond to time series with a SNR=1.1,
while circles correspond to the nominal VIRGO/SPM observa-
tions (SNR=3.3). In this later case the average errors were mul-
tiplied by 7 to adjust the scale.

The next step is to analyze the behaviour of the errors when
the spectra are smoothed before computing the cross correlation.
In Fig. 5 we plot the mean errors and their dispersions for series
of 365 and 180 days using ± 600 µHz centred in 3000 µHz, but
with diﬀerent levels of smooth. The number of points used for
the smooth are: 65, 125, 191, 251, and 315, corresponding ap-
proximately with length of: 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 µHz. The smaller
errors and dispersions are obtained when smoothing factors of
65 or 125 points are applied, corresponding to smoothing win-
dows of 2 or 4 µHz, which depends on the amount of noise of
the time series. Once again, triangles correspond to noisy data
(SNR = 1.1) and circles to the original time series (SNR = 3.3).
The series of 365 days are plotted in black and the series of 180
days in pink. It is interesting to emphasize that larger smooth
degradate the results, probably because it smears out the spectra
too much, thus attenuates the eﬀect of searched shifts.

To study the behaviour of the cross-correlation technique
with diﬀerent levels of noise and diﬀerent p-mode widths, the
mean spectrum of 365 days has been ﬁtted to obtain the width of
the individual p modes and the SNR of the spectrum. The ﬁt was
done in a global way using a Maximum Likelihood Estimatior
(e.g. Appourchaux et al. 2008), where the same width is used for
each group of one l = 0, 1, and 2 modes. The so-called “noise
background” (e.g. Mathur et al. 2011) was modelled with three
components: a ﬂat white noise component dominating the high-
frequency part of the spectrum, a power law at low frequency,
and one Harvey component (Harvey 1985) to take into account
the granulation contribution. This noisy background is ﬁtted ﬁrst
and then ﬁxed when the p modes are ﬁtted as it is usually done
in asteroseismology (e.g. Appourchaux et al. 2012; Mathur et al.
2013a). The errors in the ﬁtted parameters were obtained from
the Hessian matrix.

The resultant mode widths as a function of frequency is
shown in Figs. 6. The spectrum has p modes with widths less
than 1 µHz below 3000 µHz and wider than 2 µHz above 3300
µHz.

We have computed the cross-correlation for the spectra of
365 days in two diﬀerent ranges, from 2100 to 2900 µHz and
from 3300 to 4100 µHz without smooth and with a smooth of 2

µHz (65 points). In these two ranges the mean SNR is 2.0 for the
ﬁrst range and 2.9 for the second.

As it is well known (e.g. Salabert et al. 2004), the frequency
shift is higher for the Sun at high frequencies. At the same time,
the SNR is better at high frequencies, however, when the mean
values of the errors are obtained for both ranges, see Table 1, the
errors are ≈ 60% higher at high frequencies. This can only be at-
tributed to the higher width of the modes at high frequencies be-
cause the height of the modes are similar in both regions. In the
range where the width of the p modes increase, we have analyzed
the errors obtained in the computation of the frequency shifts for
series of 365 days with no smooth and centered at 3200, 3500
and 3800 µHz in a range of ± 300 µHz. The result is shown in
Fig. 7. The errors increase with the mode width Γ as Γ0.7±0.1.
We expect that the variation goes as Γ0.5 following similar argu-
ment as Libbrecht (1992). Nevertheless, we have to be cautious
for two reasons. First, we must keep in mind we only get three
points, which is a small number to derive a ﬁne quantitative law.
Second, the squared-root dependency is only a lower limit of the
errors.

To study the inﬂuence of the SNR on the cross-correlation
analysis we have added diﬀerent levels of normal white noise to
the origianl VIRGO/SPM time series of 6000 days. The cross-
correlation has been computed between 2400 and 3600 µHz and
no smooth has been applied. Results are shown in Fig. 8. The
errors drop drastically with the increase of SNR until reaching
SNR=2. For higher SNR, the reduction is very small.

4. Application to solar-like stars

4.1. TheCoRoTtargetHD49933

HD 49933 is a F5 main-sequence star observed twice by CoRoT,
with a ﬁrst run of 60 days in 2007 and a second of 137 days
in 2008. The light curves were obtained with a cadence of 32
seconds. It is a star hotter than the Sun, with an eﬀective tem-
perature around 6700 K, an estimated mass of 1.3 solar mass,
and an estimated radius of 1.34 solar radius. This star has been
widely analysed (e.g. Appourchaux et al. 2008; Benomar et al.
2009; Kallinger et al. 2010), and it was also the ﬁrst star, apart
from the Sun, in which asteroseismic measurements of global
changes in the frequencies of their acoustic modes were reported
(Garc´ıa et al. 2010; Salabert et al. 2011), conﬁrming the devel-
opment of an on-going stellar magnetic activity cycle.

In this work we use the series of 137 days long to analyze
the behaviour of the errors of the cross-correlation signal using
Monte Carlo simulations. In particular, we have used series of
30 and 60 days shifted every 15 days. The reference spectrum
is the average spectrum obtained from independent series, i.e.,
4 spectra are used in the case of 30-day long subseries, while
only two subseries are averaged when the length of the subseries
is 60 days. The power spectrum of each subseries is centered
at νmax=1850 µHz (the frequency of maximum power), and we
study diﬀerent frequency ranges, as well as smooth factors. The
number of points used to smoothing the spectrum are 11, 21, and
41, corresponding to smoothing windows of 2, 4 and 8 µHz in
the case of the subseries of 60 days. It is important to note that he
smaller errors are obtained with the 11 points smoothing factor.
A summary of the results obtained for the diﬀerent ranges
using subseries of 60-day long with an 11-point smoothing fac-
tor is shown in Table 2. Using the range of ±400 µHz around
νmax we obtain the smallest errors in the computed frequency
shifts.

The temporal evolution of the frequency shifts of HD 49933
is shown in Fig. 9 for series of 30 and 60 days centred in
νmax=1850 µHz with a range of ±400 µHz and a smoothing fac-
tor of 11 points. These results are in well agreement with the
obtained by Garc´ıa et al. (2010).

In this star, the width of the p modes is between 3 and 11
µHz (Benomar et al. 2009). In the range of ± 400 µHz around
νmax, the average p-mode width is 6.3 µHz, and the SNR for the
60-day average spectrum is 2.1, see Table 3.

As we expected from the width of the acoustic modes and
the level of noise, the computed errors are quite big. The use of
60 days subseries produces smaller errors. However, when the
longer subseries are used the resultant maximum frequency shift
is reduced, due to the short period of the magnetic activity cycle
of the star and the short amount of data available (137 days).
Indeed the maximum frequency shifts are 1.12 ± 0.32 µHz and

subseries of 30 days (triangles) and 60 days (circles) shifted ev-
ery 15 days. The region used is centred at νmax=1850 µHz with
a range of ±400 µHz and a smoothing factor of 11 points.

4.2. The Kepler targetsKIC3733735andKIC7940546

KIC 3733735 is also a F5 main-sequence star, observed by
Kepler in short cadence (58.85 seconds, Gilliland et al. 2010;
Garc´ıa et al. 2011) along 1114 days. A seismic study has been
performed by Appourchaux et al. (2012), and its magnetic ac-
tivity was analyzed by Mathur et al. (2014a), where a cycle-like
behaviour has been detected from the study of the temporal evo-
lution of the light curve. KIC 3733735 has a Teﬀ around 6700
K, a radius of 1.66 solar radius, and a mass of 1.95 solar masses
(Mathur et al. 2012). The acoustic modes of this star are wider
than the modes of the previous analyzed CoRoT star, from 4 to
14 µHz (Appourchaux et al. 2014). Thus, the mean linewidth is
8.9 µHz in the range 1650 - 2250 µHz.

In Fig. 10 we show the computed frequency shifts using sub-
series of 180 days shifted every 60 days. Each spectrum is cen-
tred in νmax=1950 µHz, with a range of ± 300 µHz and smoothed
by 31 points, corresponding to a smoothing window of 2 µHz
(black curve). The reference spectrum is the mean of the inde-
pendent spectra. This combination of parameters is the one pro-
ducing the smallest errors. The SNR of the mean 180-day spec-
trum in the selected range of p modes is 1.7.

As the level of the noise and the width of the modes is some-
thing that we can not change in the observations, we can only
check the eﬀects of changing the length of the subseries, the p-
mode range, and the smoothing factor. Similar to the solar case,
the length of the series is the dominant factor producing a bigger
change in the computed errors.

in Table 4. The errors decrease with the length of the subseries
similar to the solar case .

In Fig. 10, superimposed to the computed frequency shift,
is the time evolution of the photospheric activity proxy (S ph,
Mathur et al. 2014b) obtained from the long cadence Kepler data
shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 1 by Mathur et al. (2014a).
We have integrated those values to the same 180 days than in the
frequency shifts (pink triangles) for the independent series, that
are shown as black full circles in the frequency shift plot. The
error bars of these points correspond to the dispersion of S ph
in each 180-d segment. Comparing both proxies of the activity
we see they are compatible inside the error bars but we observe
a lag of about 120 days between the two. Several authors (e.g.
Jain et al. 2009; Salabert et al. 2009, 2015) already discussed the
possibility that there could be a time lag between the manifesta-
tion of the magnetism in the photosphere and the perturbation in
the frequency of the acoustic modes.

Fig. 10. Frequency shifts of KIC 3733735 calculated using 180-
day subseries shifted every 60 days.The points obtained from
independent spectra are shown as full black circles. The power
spectrum is centred at a νmax=1950 µHz with a range of ± 300
µHz and a smooth of 31 points. The mean spectra used as the ref-
erence for the cross-correlation are generated with independent
spectra. The pink curve is the S ph computed by Mathur et al.
(2014a). The pink triangles are the integration of the S ph to the
same 180d ranges than the frequency shifts.

KIC 7940546 is the second Kepler star that we have ana-
lyzed. It is also a F5 main-sequence star with a Teﬀ around 6350
K, a radius of 1.95 solar radius, and a mass of 1.41 solar mass.

Fig. 11. Frequency shifts of KIC 7940546 calculated using in-
dependent 60-day subseries centred in νmax=1080 µHz and with
a range of ±400 µHz (triangles), and using 180-day subseries
shifted 60 days (circles). The reference spectra is the average of
the independent subseries. In both cases the spectra has not been
smoothed.

Its surface magnetic activity was also studied by Mathur et al.
(2014a), and it was one of the less active star in their sample.

KIC 7940546 was observed in short cadence along 928 days.
Spectra from series of 30, 60, 90, and 180 days were produced
to obtain the frequency shifts in a range of ±400 µHz around
νmax=1080 µHz. In Table 5 the average errors in the frequency
shifts and their dispersions obtained from the diﬀerent sub-
series’ lengths are shown. As we can notice, the mean errors
are very small compared with those obtained for KIC 3733735
(see Table 4) and they are comparable with the solar ones, (see
Fig. 3).

The seismic study of this star has not yet been performed.
Therefore, we do a similar global analysis as the one described
for the Sun. We found a mean width of the p modes of 3.5 µHz
and a very good SNR of 3.0. From these values, we eﬀectively
expect small errors.

In Fig. 11, we plot the obtained frequency shifts for the in-
dependent subseries of 60 days and for the subseries of 180 days
shifted every 60 days. As for the previous stars, the reference
spectrum for the calculation of the cross-correlation is the mean
spectrum obtained from independent subseries of data. As we
expect from the magnetic analysis performed by Mathur et al.
(2014a) this star does not show any frequency shifts during all
the observing time.

C. R´egulo et al.: Magnetic activity cycles in solar-like stars: The cross-correlation technique of p-mode frequency shifts

5. Discussion and Conclusion

The cross-correlation technique is a simple, fast, and non de-
manding method to implement in order to unveil the possible
existence of on-going stellar magnetic activity cycles. This is
particularly interesting when we want to study hundreds to thou-
sands stars with the present and future space instruments, be-
cause we can avoid the process of ﬁtting the individual p modes
of a huge number of stars, and this for every subseries.

As the signiﬁcance of the solution depends on the calculated
errors, in the present paper, we derive a method to properly com-
pute the errors of the frequency shifts using Monte Carlo simu-
lations. We have ﬁrst tested the methodology using the Sun and
then with 3 well known solar-like stars observed with CoRoT
and Kepler.

We have found that the errors fall following a power law with
the length of the series and with the SNR, while they increase
with the width of the p modes.

Related to the length of the subseries used, they are limited
by two factors: the length of the data and the length of the activ-
ity cycle. In several cases, a small level of smooth in the power
spectrum seems to help in reducing the ﬁnal errors of the fre-
quency shifts.

In the case of the Sun, where we can use subseries as long
as one year with high SNR, we have managed to obtain errors as
small as 0.02 µHz in a signal with a global change of 0.45 µHz.
That is, an error of ∼ 4% of the signal.

In the case of HD 49933, the maximum length we managed
to use was 60 days because the length of the observations was
137 days. For this star we obtain errors of 48% of the global shift.
These high errors are principally related with the short lenghts
of the used series.

In the case of KIC 3733735, the maximum length of the
used series was 180 days because the change in the activity is
no longer than 250 days from maximum to minimum. The ob-
tained errors for this star were around 45% of the signal. This
big errors are due to the small SNR and the large widths of the p
modes.

For comparison, we have also analysed a star, KIC 7940546,
which is not showing any surface magnetic activity cycle dur-
ing the observing time. Moreover, this star has not very broad p
modes and has a very good SNR around νmax. Thus, the obtained
errors were small. The computed frequency shifts are zero inside
1 σ of the errors that are as small as we expected from the char-
acteristic of the spectra.

Even with the obtained error levels, the diﬀerence in the re-
sults between the active and the quiet star are clear enough to
justify the use of the cross-correlation technique as a fast way to
analyse the mean frequency shifts of the huge amount of solar-
like stars we have today and in the near future.
