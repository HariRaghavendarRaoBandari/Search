We provide an eﬀective description of a particle-hole symmetric state of electrons

in a half-ﬁlled Landau level, starting from the traditional approach pioneered by

Halperin, Lee and Read. Speciﬁcally, we study a system consisting of alternating

quasi-one-dimensional strips of composite Fermi liquid (CFL) and composite hole

liquid (CHL), both of which break particle-hole symmetry. When the CFL and

CHL strips are identical in size, the resulting state is manifestly invariant under the

combined action of a particle-hole transformation with respect to a single Landau

level (which interchanges the CFL and CHL) and translation by one unit, equal to

the strip width, in the direction transverse to the strips. At distances long compared

to the strip width, we demonstrate that the system is described by a Dirac fermion

coupled to an emergent gauge ﬁeld, with an anti-unitary particle-hole symmetry, as

recently proposed by Son.

INTRODUCTION

An inﬂuential way of understanding much of the physics of the quantum Hall regime

invokes the idea of composite fermions [1]. In essence, a composite fermion can be viewed

as an electron (or hole) bound to several ﬂux quanta. The challenging problem of electrons

strongly interacting with one another in a partially ﬁlled Landau level can be recast in terms

of (hopefully) simpler eﬀective descriptions involving composite fermions. While ultimately

an inspired guess, the composite fermion perspective nevertheless leads to an elegant un-

derstanding of all observed quantum Hall states. Furthermore, theories based on composite

fermions have led to several spectacular predictions [1] - including that of a gapless metal-

2

lic ground state in a half-ﬁlled (ν = 1/2) Landau level - which have been experimentally

observed [2–4].

In a pioneering study, Halperin, Lee and Read [5] (as well as Kalmeyer and Zhang [6])

suggested that this gapless state at half-ﬁlling ought to be a metallic state of composite

fermions - a composite Fermi liquid (CFL), in zero background magnetic ﬁeld. This approach

is a simple eﬀective ﬁeld theory in which electrons bound to two ﬂux quanta form a ﬁlled

Fermi sea. The eﬀective description involves composite fermion “quasiparticles” that are

coupled to a Chern-Simons gauge ﬁeld - which implements ﬂux attachment - and the resulting

system is strongly coupled. Despite such diﬃculties the CFL theory has led to a widely

accepted qualitative understanding of the half-ﬁlled Landau level, and its instabilities to

incompressible states as are seen in the second Landau level at ν = 5/2 [7].

Although the CFL theory motivates a physically-compelling mean-ﬁeld description of

the half-ﬁlled Landau level, it suﬀers from a drawback: it strongly breaks particle-hole (PH)

symmetry, which is a property of the half-ﬁlled lowest Landau level Hamiltonian in the limit

of vanishing Landau level mixing, in apparent contradiction with electrical transport exper-

iments [8–10].11 Indeed, as suggested in [12], in order that the electrical Hall conductivity

σxy = 1

must exhibit a large Hall conductivity σ(cf )
zero magnetic ﬁeld on average at half-ﬁlling, one instead expects σ(cf )

that PH symmetry must be broken.

Remarkable recent experiments [14–16] highlighting the importance of PH symmetry

(and the PH transformation, more generally) in the half-ﬁlled lowest Landau level led to

the study [17] of an alternate construction of the ν = 1/2 state, the composite hole liquid

(CHL), which consists of holes of a ﬁlled Landau level, at half-ﬁlling, attached to two ﬂux

quanta.18 In a theory that admits a spontaneous breaking of PH symmetry, the CHL and

CFL may be thought of as two degenerate ground states, one of which is spontaneously

chosen, in analogy with the up and down spin states of an Ising model. Alternatively, a ﬁrst

order transition may also occur between these two distinct states.

Our goal here is to understand how PH symmetry might be restored, starting from

the symmtry-broken CFL and CHL formulations. At ﬁrst glance, such a task appears to

be hopeless: it is loosely analogous to constructing a description of the critical point of the

Ising model in terms of the ordered phases that describe the physics far away from criticality.

3

Nevertheless, by considering an inhomogeneous conﬁguration built from both the CFL and

CHL, we will show that it is possible to restore PH symmetry on long length scales.

In

analogy to the Ising model, it is as though we attempt to construct a critical state by

studying domains of up and down spin conﬁgurations. With the help of hindsight, we know

that such a construction can indeed restore the symmetry: in the case of the Ising model,

fermionic modes associated with the domain walls are deconﬁned at the critical point, and

provide a description of the emergent critical behavior.

More speciﬁcally, we describe the PH symmetric ν = 1/2 state by considering a two-

dimensional (2D) spatial plane patterned with CFL and CHL strips (Fig. 3), where domain

walls between the two regions possess new emergent fermions that will ultimately represent

the low-energy degrees of freedom of a PH symmetric half-ﬁlled Landau level. As we show

below, this strategy leads to a successful description of the PH symmetric half-ﬁlled LL.

Our conﬁguration enjoys the combined symmetry of a PH transformation and translation

by one “unit,” equal to the strip width, in the direction transverse to the strips. In the long-

wavelength limit, i.e. for lengths much larger than the width of these strips, the resulting

system at low energies consists of an electrically-neutral composite Dirac particle coupled

to an emergent U(1) gauge ﬁeld (analogous to [19]), with an anti-unitary implementation

of the PH symmetry, precisely of the form conjectured by Son in a remarkable recent paper

[20]. Recent work [21–27] has sought to conﬁrm and explore the duality proposed by Son.

While our construction shows that there is in principle an RG ﬂow between the CFL/CHL

states and the composite Dirac liquid, other possibilities, including ﬁrst order transitions

between the CFL and CHL can also occur, but will not be considered here.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we review the composite Fermi and com-

posite hole theories and describe the action of the particle-hole transformation. In Sec. III,

we show how a particle-hole symmetric composite Fermi liquid emerges at long wavelengths

from the patterned plane conﬁguration. We conclude and mention a few possible directions

of future work in Sec. IV.

A. Bulk description

The traditional approach to the eﬀective description of the half-ﬁlled lowest Landau
level (LLL) involves the composite Fermi liquid lagrangian, LCFL = Lf + Lgauge + Lint (see
Refs.1,28,29 for reviews):

Lf = f†(cid:16)

f is the destruction operator of a composite electron with eﬀective mass mf , aµ is an

emergent gauge ﬁeld, Aµ represents the electromagnetic gauge ﬁeld with non-zero average

symmetric symbol is deﬁned by ﬁxing txy = 1, the two spatial coordinates r = (x, y) and
r(cid:48) = (x(cid:48), y(cid:48)), and both gauge charges have unit magnitude). The average density of composite
electrons (cid:104)f†f(cid:105) ≡ nf .

A partially-ﬁlled LLL can equally well be described in terms of holes of the ﬁlled Landau

level. Thus, we might instead describe the half-ﬁlled LLL using the composite hole liquid
lagrangian, LCHL = Lh + Lgauge + Lint

where now, h is the destruction operator of a composite hole with eﬀective mass mh, and
bµ is an emergent gauge ﬁeld. The second term in Lgauge describes the ﬁlled Landau level
vacuum, which leads to an integer Hall conductance. Note that the electromagnetic charge

of the composite holes is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to that of the composite

electrons.

Before we proceed with an explicit construction of a PH symmetric half-ﬁlled Landau

level, we require that the two Lagrangians above yield consistent predictions for the electronic

5

properties of the ν = 1/2 state. For instance, the physical electromagnetic charge density
follows from diﬀerentiating both LCFL and LCHL with respect to At. Equating the resulting
operators, we ﬁnd:

f†f + h†h =

(II.3)

At a heuristic level, LCFL and LCHL describe the dynamics of the particles that result
from attaching two units of ﬂux to the electrons or to the holes of the lowest Landau level.

Away from half-ﬁlling, the system of interest may be described either in terms of composite

electrons or composite holes: the two descriptions represent a diﬀerent way of encoding

the same state. For instance, the Laughlin state at ν = 1/3 can be described either as

an integer quantum Hall state of composite electrons, νf = 1, or of composite holes with

a diﬀerent ﬁlling fraction νh = 2. At half-ﬁlling, however, PH symmetry requires that the

two descriptions must be one and the same. This requirement is obscured by the fact that
treated at mean-ﬁeld level, both LCFL and LCHL manifestly break PH symmetry. We will
see how to overcome this diﬃculty below. For now, we note that in order for LCFL and LCHL
to map into one another under a PH transformation, the couplings must satisfy mf = mh
and U (x) = ˜U (x).

In addition, we require that the anti-unitary PH transformation be

implemented using the following three steps. First, we transform

(at, ax, ay) (cid:55)→ (at,−ax,−ay),
(bt, bx, by) (cid:55)→ (bt,−bx,−by),
(At, Ax, Ay) (cid:55)→ (−At, Ax, Ay),

(II.4)

1

along with the mapping (t, x, y) (cid:55)→ (−t, x, y) and i (cid:55)→ −i.30 Next, we shift Lgauge → Lgauge +
4π µνρAµ∂µAρ.31 Lastly, we take f (cid:55)→ h, h (cid:55)→ f , and relabel the two emergent gauge ﬁelds:
aµ ↔ bµ. In this way, LCFL and LCHL map into one another.

B. Boundary lagrangians

If the CFL is placed in the lower half-plane y < 0 with a topologically trivial vacuum in

the upper half-plane (y > 0), gauge invariance requires the presence of boundary degrees of

6

freedom at y = 0 with lagrangian:

δ(y = 0).

(II.5)

Together, the boundary and bulk lagrangians of composite electrons are invariant under the

gauge transformation,

aµ (cid:55)→ aµ + ∂µΛa,
f (cid:55)→ eiΛaf,
1
φf (cid:55)→ φf −
2

Λa.

(II.6)

The ﬁrst two terms in Eq. (II.5) are gauge invariant and describe the dynamics of the bound-

ary modes. The third is required to absorb the (anomalous) gauge transformation of the
bulk Chern-Simons term in Lgauge [17, 32–34]. Since f carries unit electromagnetic charge,
it follows from above that the boundary operator ψe = e2iφf f carries unit electromagnetic

charge but is neutral with respect to aµ. Thus, we naturally identify ψe with the electron

destruction operator at a boundary.

Likewise, if the CHL is placed in the lower half-plane (with the topologically-trivial

vacuum in the upper half-plane), gauge invariance requires the addition of the boundary

degrees of freedom:

In addition to the hole destruction operator, ψh = e−2iφhh which has opposite electromag-
netic charge as ψe above, and is neutral with respect to bµ, there is a chiral boson ﬁeld

φLL describing the edge mode of a ﬁlled Landau level: the corresponding edge electron
destruction operator of the ﬁlled Landau level is ψLL ∼ eiφLL.

trivial vacuum in the upper half-plane. The chiral ﬁeld φf is indicated by the short dashed line and

described by the lagrangian in Eq. (II.5). The right side displays the CHL in the lower half-plane

and the ν = 1 integer quantum Hall state in the upper half-plane. The chiral ﬁeld φh is indicated by

the long dashed line and described by the lagrangian in Eq. (II.7). A particle-hole transformation

maps the left and right conﬁgurations into one another and transforms the part of the lagrangians

describing φf and φh into one another.

In order to ﬁnd a consistent deﬁnition for how a PH transformation should act on the

boundary degrees of freedom, it is useful to consider a setup where the CFL lies in the

lower half-plane and the topologically trivial vacuum is in the upper-half plane (Fig. 1). A

particle-hole transformation maps this system onto a ﬁlled Landau level for y > 0 and a

CHL in y < 0. Thus, we require

where χ = +1 for a right-moving ﬁeld and χ = −1 for a left-moving ﬁeld. (The choice for
the constant shifts of the ﬁelds is not determined from consistency of the above picture, but

in the next section.) At ﬁrst glance, the resulting description seems to miss the mode

corresponding to the ﬁlled Landau level. However, as shown in Fig. 1, the ﬁlled Landau

level occurs over the entire 2D plane. Thus, generally, it thus does not contribute any new

edge mode.

FIG. 2. The left side of the ﬁgure depicts the CFL in the lower half-plane and the CHL in the

upper half-plane. The right side displays the CFL in the lower half-plane and the CHL in the

upper half-plane. The chiral ﬁeld φf is indicated by the short dashed line, the φh ﬁeld by the long

dashed line, and the chiral mode φLL of the ﬁlled Landau level by the full line. A particle-hole

transformation maps the left and right conﬁgurations into one another.

We infer the PH transformation on the ﬁlled Landau level mode using a setup where the

composite Fermi liquid is in the lower-half plane and the composite hole liquid is in the upper

half-plane (Fig. 2). Under a PH transformation, the chirality of the Landau level mode is

reversed, but the sign of the coupling to electromagnetism is maintained. This ensures that

the electromagnetic charge of ψLL is preserved since an initially right-moving Landau level
†
LL ∼ eiφLL maps to a left-moving destruction

electron creation operator along the interface ψ
operator ψLL ∼ eiφLL under a PH transformation in this particular setup.

THEORY

A. General setup

Having reviewed the description of a half-ﬁlled Landau level in terms of composite elec-

trons or composite holes, we now describe how a PH symmetric state arises from alternating

strips of the composite Fermi and composite hole liquid. The speciﬁc setup that we consider

is illustrated in Fig. 3.

It consists in taking the CFL to lie in narrow strips of width δ

oriented along the x-direction for y ∈ [qδ, (q + 1)δ] with q ∈ 2Z + 1 and the CHL to lie in
the strips between y ∈ [pδ, (p + 1)δ] with p ∈ 2Z. This setup is invariant under translations

along the x-direction and translations by 2δ along the y-direction, but it is not invariant

under general spatial rotations.

FIG. 3. Schematic picture of the two-dimensional spatial plane patterned with alternating strips

of the composite Fermi liquid – shown in red – and the composite hole liquid – shown in blue. The

strips have width equal to δ and run along the x-direction.

This conﬁguration is not invariant under a PH transformation. However, it is invariant

under the combined action of a PH transformation and a translation by one unit equal

to δ in the y-direction. We refer to this combined action as the microscopic particle-hole

10

composite Fermi liquidcomposite Fermi liquidcomposite Fermi liquidcomposite hole liquidcomposite hole liquid············xy transformation. At long wavelengths, we will see that the combined action becomes identical

to a PH transformation.

B. Coupled-wire approach

The long wavelength theory is obtained in the limit where the strip width δ → 0. In this
limit, the physics of the CFL and CHL regions eﬀectively becomes one-dimensional. Thus,

it is natural to describe the composite fermions and composite holes within their respective

narrow strips in terms of wire arrays.

We consider a setup in which there are Nf (Nh) composite Fermi (hole) wires within each

composite Fermi (hole) strip. The wires are taken to run along the x-direction and to lie

at regularly spaced intervals between y/δ ∈ Z. On each wire, indexed by y, it is convenient
to expand f† and h† in terms of their chiral components; for convenience, we also write out
the form of the electron creation operator of the ﬁlled Landau level mode:

−ikL

f (y)xf

f†(t, x, y) = e
h†(t, x, y) = e−ikL

(III.1)

The Klein factors (γy = γ∗
y) obey the anti-commutation relations: {γy, γy(cid:48)} = 2δy,y(cid:48),{γy, f} =
0, and {γy, h} = 0. The diﬀering factors of eikf,hx in the above expansions are due to the
fact that f and h couple to electromagnetism with opposite sign and the possibility that
Nf (cid:54)= Nh.

On each wire, the 1D composite fermion density – identiﬁed with the 1D limit of the

electron ﬂuid density – equals

(and similarly for the quasi-hole density on each

(III.2)

The position-dependent shift proportional to By of the Fermi points away from their zero
ﬁeld values at ±(kR

f (y))/2 (and similarly for the holes) implies that we do not

f (y) − kL

11

assume the emergent gauge ﬁelds cancel the background magnetic ﬂux.

In other words,

we do not assume that the composite Fermi or composite hole liquids realize the mean-ﬁeld

solution to the equations of motion in which the emergent gauge ﬁeld screens the background

magnetic ﬂux. Away from half-ﬁlling, the one-dimensional composite Fermi and composite

hole densities generally diﬀer.

To describe the ﬁlled Landau level, we take NLL ≥ 2 free fermion wires regularly spaced
NLL−1 for n = 0, 1, . . . , NLL − 1 within each composite hole region.35 Within
these regions, the wires are coupled together via appropriate inter-wire integer Hall state

at y/δ ∈ 2Z + n

generating perturbations.36 There are no free fermion wires in the composite Fermi regions.

The Fermi momenta of the ﬁlled Landau level edge modes:

kLL(y) =

|B|δ

2(NLL − 1) − By,

for the right-movers at y/δ ∈ 2Z, while

kLL(y) = − |B|δ

2(NLL − 1) − By,

(III.3)

(III.4)

for the left-movers at y/δ ∈ 2Z + 1.

While the numbers of wires Nf , Nh and NLL within each region are free parameters,

we ﬁnd it necessary to make a speciﬁc choice in the analysis presented below. We take
Nf = Nh = (NLL − 1)/2 = 1. From the above equations, we see that this choice implies
the 1D densities of the modes on each wire are identical; Nf = Nh = 1 is simply the
minimal number of wires required and naturally obtains in the one-dimensional δ → 0 limit
of interest. We will show that this choice ensures that the interactions we study preserve

translation invariance along the wires; for general values of Nf , Nh and NLL, our route to

a PH symmetric composite Fermi liquid requires translation-invariance to be broken along

the wires.37

The emergent gauge ﬁelds are not restricted to the wires; they can be taken to live
throughout each narrow strip. Thus, aµ lives in the composite Fermi strips x ∈ (−∞,∞), y ∈
[qδ, (q+1)δ] for q ∈ 2Z+1, while bµ is deﬁned in the composite hole regions x ∈ (−∞,∞), y ∈
[pδ, (p + 1)δ] for p ∈ 2Z.

Fig. 4 depicts more precisely our speciﬁc setup. We have taken the CFL and CHL wires

to lie at y/δ ∈ 2Z ∓ 1
2. Since Nf = Nh = 1, there is no inter-wire composite fermion
tunneling within a CFL or CHL region. The covariant derivatives: Df ≡ ∂ − i(a + A) and
Dh ≡ ∂ − i(b − A). The Fermi velocities: vf = kF /mf and vh = kF /mh. Invariance under
the microscopic PH transformation requires all velocities to be independent of position and
to satisfy: vf = vh ≡ vF and vφf = vφh ≡ v.

To study the action S, it is convenient to make the following ﬁeld redeﬁnitions along the

C. Emergence of the particle-hole symmetric composite fermion

We now turn to a description for how a PH symmetric composite Fermi liquid can emerge

from S, supplemented by suitable interactions. In total, the symmetries we wish to preserve

are (i) electromagnetism, (ii) translations along the x-direction, (iii) translations by 2δ in

the y-direction, and (iv) invariance under the microscopic PH transformation.

1. The interaction

In the spirit of eﬀective ﬁeld theory, we generally allow all interactions consistent with

the symmetries of S. After some exploration, we have found it useful to concentrate upon

the eﬀects of the following interaction Hint = H1 + H2:

in the long wavelength eﬀective theory. In the above expansion, we have only retained terms

without oscillating prefactors. Note that we have had to assume that the composite electrons

and holes are at half-ﬁlling with respect to an underlying spatial lattice running along the

x-direction in order to obtain these expansions.

We imagine working in the perturbative limit g2 (cid:28) g1 (cid:28) 1 which allows us to ﬁrst
focus upon the eﬀects of H1 and to subsequently study the eﬀects of H2. This limit may

be justiﬁed by noting that H1 is an “on-site” interaction for ﬁelds localized near a line

interface separating a composite Fermi and composite hole region, while H2 connects ﬁelds

across a strip. We show below that H1 patches together the composite Fermi and composite

hole strips. H2 both delocalizes the electrically-neutral composite fermion arising from the

fermionization of ϕ and lifts the composite fermions f and h from the low-energy eﬀective

theory.

2. Patching the strips together

We ﬁrst consider the eﬀects of H1. About the non-interacting point in parameter space,

H1 has scaling dimension equal to two and is marginal. We assume the presence of short-

ranged repulsive density-density interactions between ˜ϕ and φLL which drive H1 relevant.

17

Formally integrating out the composite fermions f and h at one-loop, we generate a (Eu-

(cid:112)k2

In writing the above potential, we have performed a partial Fourier transform with respect

to the Euclidean time and x-coordinate. The cutoﬀ Λ can be identiﬁed with the inverse of

a short-distance cutoﬀ, such as an underlying spatial lattice.

The one-loop potential VO1 has an instability in the infrared

0+k2
x
Λ (cid:28) 1 which favors
the condensation (cid:104)O1(cid:105) (cid:54)= 0. Invariance under the microscopic PH transformation implies
that the condensation occurs by ﬁxing

√k2

(cid:104) ˜ϕ + φLL(cid:105) = 0.

(III.16)

Thus, we infer from the form of the one-loop potential that the IR dynamics are such that

Eq. (III.16) is satisﬁed.

What are the consequences of the condensate (cid:104) ˜ϕ + φLL(cid:105) = 0? Under the emergent and

electromagnetic gauge symmetries, O1 transforms as

O1(t, x, y) (cid:55)→ e(−1)

y+δ

δ i(Λa+ΛA)−i(Λb−ΛA)O1(t, x, y)

(III.17)

where Λa (Λb) is the gauge parameter of aµ (bµ) and ΛA is the parameter for electromag-
netism. Therefore, if O1 (or more precisely, |O1|2) acquires a vacuum expectation value, then
the expansion about the resulting minimum of the eﬀective potential results in a breaking
of the full gauge symmetry to the subgroup under which O1 is neutral. Thus, we equate

aµ + Aµ = bµ − Aµ

(III.18)

along the line interfaces. Eq. (III.18) is the patching condition that deﬁnes a single emergent

gauge ﬁeld. This equation can equivalently be written as

βµ = Aµ

(III.19)

and allows us to identify αµ as the globally-deﬁned emergent gauge ﬁeld. (The electromag-

netic ﬁeld is, of course, already deﬁned throughout the 2D plane.) We can check using Eq.

(III.10) that the patching condition respects the PH transformation. The second conse-

quence is that the ˜ϕ and φLL excitations obtain a mass and decouple from the low-energy

18

physics. The third implication is simply that when we replace O1 by its vacuum expectation
value, i.e., set ˜ϕ + φLL = 0 in Eq. (III.13), the composite fermions f and h can hop into one

another across the 2D plane.

In Sbulk, we note the appearance of a Chern-Simons term for αµ with alternating coeﬃcient
proportional to (−1)m+1, a BF coupling between αµ and the electromagnetic ﬁeld Aµ, and
a level 1/2 Chern-Simons term for Aµ. In the long wavelength limit δ → 0, the alternating
Chern-Simons term can be ignored. Therefore, we will henceforth drop this term in the

analysis below. Sinterfaces describes a collection of one-dimensional wires each hosting a

chiral boson minimally coupled to αµ whose chirality alternates from wire to wire.

3. Delocalization of the neutral composite fermion

4. The neutral composite fermion as an exciton of semions

Insertion on a boundary of a semion or single vortex of the composite Fermi liquid is
accomplished by the e∓iφf operator, where the sign in the exponential is determined by the
orientation of the boundary. (Recall the electron creation operator on a boundary takes the
e = e∓2iφf f†.) The semion operator by itself is not physical because φf is charged
form ψ†
under the emergent gauge symmetry and so, strictly speaking, we are restricted to operators

formed from gauge-invariant combinations of φf and f . Similarly, in the composite hole
liquid, e±iφh creates a semion on any boundary of the space.

Along a line interface separating the composite Fermi and composite hole liquids, the
operator e∓i(φf +φh) creates one semion from each of the two theories. Using the ﬁeld redeﬁ-
nitions in Eq. (III.7), we ﬁnd

e∓i(φf +φh) = e∓iϕ.

(III.26)

In this way, we see that the electrically neutral composite fermion ψ

†

L/R ∼ e∓iϕ can be

viewed as an exciton of semions of the composite Fermi and composite hole theories. It is

interesting to note the similarity to the description advocated by Wang and Senthil24 of the

particle-hole symmetric composite fermion as a semion dipole.

IV. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we have provided a picture for how a particle-hole symmetric composite

fermion theory arises from the composite Fermi and composite hole liquids. The latter two

theories are conjugate to one another under a particle-hole transformation. The particle-

hole symmetric formulation was found by examining the long wavelength description of the

two-dimensional spatial plane patterned with alternating strips of the composite Fermi and

composite hole liquid.

There are a variety of problems that we plan to consider in the future.

It has recently been argued [38] that composite fermions play a role in the eﬀective

description of the ﬁeld-tuned superconductor-insulator transition in thin ﬁlms [39–43]. We

plan to use methods similar to those in this paper to formulate a particle-vortex symmetric

theory for the transition and the emergent metallic phase.

21

An alternative possible setup in which to derive a particle-hole symmetric composite

fermion theory is to take alternating strips of the Pfaﬃan [44] and anti-Pfaﬃan theories

[45,46]. In this case, the analog of the H1 interaction leaves behind an interface theory with

chiral central charge equal to two instead of one, as we found above. It would be interesting

to better understand the resulting long wavelength limit.

The constant subleading correction in the entanglement entropy of a system with abelian

topological order can be aﬀected by interactions lying along the entanglement cut [47]. These

interactions take the form of the correlated hopping terms studied in this paper. It would

be interesting to characterize how the entanglement entropy of a gapless system is aﬀected,

or rather, determined by such interactions.

Landau level mixing is parameterized by the ratio of the cyclotron frequency to the

strength of the average Coulomb interaction. For realistic (bare) parameters, this ratio is

of order one. Nevertheless, a Hall conductivity σxy = 1
2

e2
h , consistent with particle-hole
symmery [12], is observed at half-ﬁlling [8–10]. On a more theoretical level, the Landau

level mixing corrections to the lowest Landau level Hamiltonian were calculated in [48] and

found to be numerically small for realistic values of parameters. Could these experiments

and theoretical results indicate that the particle-hole symmetric composite Fermi liquid is

an attractor of the renormalization group?

In previous work [17], it was argued that the CFL and CHL states are distinct phases

of matter analogous to the up and down spin states of an Ising system. Since the quantity
h ≡ (ν − 1/2) acts as a particle-hole symmetry breaking ﬁeld, its sign determines whether
the CFL or CHL is the lower energy ground state. To the extent that there exists a critical

point at which particle-hole symmetry is spontaneously broken at ν = 1/2 (h = 0), it follows

that there can also exist a ﬁrst-order transition between the CFL and CHL as h changes

sign. However, it was shown in [49, 50] that such ﬁrst order transitions are forbidden in the

presence of dipolar or Coulomb interactions. Instead, a modulated “stripe” phase consisting

of CFL and CHL regions would be expected to have a lower energy. Thus, it is conceivable

that in this case, the choice of patterning strips of CFL and CHL phases may be more than

merely a matter of convenience: it may well be the case that broken translational symmetry

of the sort considered here in its simplest form (along the y-direction) may well describe the

physics of the half-ﬁlled Landau level in the presence of long-ranged interactions. However,

when the interactions are short-ranged, it remains quite possible that the stripe phase melts

22

and there could well be a ﬁrst-order transition between the composite Fermi and composite

hole liquids. We wish to explore such issues, and also to explore similar aspects of half-ﬁlled

higher Landau levels in future work.

30 In terms of the charge-conjugation C and time-reversal T transformations, PH acts by T on

the emergent gauge ﬁelds and coordinates, and by CT on the electromagnetic gauge ﬁeld.

31 This shift is reminiscent of the shift of the three spatial dimensional quantum electrodynamic

eﬀective lagrangian by a term proportional µνρτ ∂µAνF ρτ due to the (anomalous)

transformation of the fermionic path integral measure under a chiral rotation.

35 The assumption of non-interacting fermions is inessential and is merely made to simplify the

description. Weak interactions may be included using bosonization.

36 In the linearized limit, such perturbations are identiﬁed as the unique single-particle

interaction that scatters a left-moving fermion into a right-moving fermion on the wire above

it while maintaining translations along the x-direction and charge conservation.

37 It is generally an interesting, unsolved question to determine the degree to which disorder is

important to the stabilization of the metallic behavior observed about half-ﬁling in the

two-dimensional electron gas. We do not consider the role played by weak (or strong, for that

matter) disorder in this paper, however, such considerations are well worth further study.
