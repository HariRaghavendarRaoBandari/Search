Abstract. The objective of this paper is to study the thermodynamics and
thermodynamic geometry of charged de-Sitter and charged anti de-Sitter black hole
solutions in massive gravity.
In this study, the presence of a negative cosmological
constant is identiﬁed as a thermodynamic variable, the pressure. By incorporating this
idea, we study the eﬀect of curvature parameter as well as the mass of graviton in the
thermodynamics of the black hole system. We further extend our studies to diﬀerent
topology of the space time and its eﬀects on phase transition and thermodynamics.
In addition, the phase transition structure of the black hole and its interactions are
reproduced using geometrothermodynamics.

1. Introduction

It is being believed that the idea of incorporating a small mass to the graviton will
deﬁnitely lead to a new modiﬁed theory of gravity. The ﬁrst attempt towards the
realization of this theory was initiated by Fierz and Pauli [1]. They added a quadratic
mass to the action as,

L = −1
8

m2(h2

µν − Ah2).

But it is observed that this linearized Fierz-Pauli theory violates the gauge invariance
in general relativity. Considering the linear Fierz-Pauli theory in the zero limit of
graviton mass, i.e., m → 0, the theory was unable to recover the general relativity. This
mismatch leads to contradiction with the solar system tests due to van Dam-Veltman-
Zakharov discontinuity [4], regardless of smallness of graviton mass, the relativistic
and non relativistic matter couple to gravity with diﬀerent relative strengths. By
introducing the nonlinear eﬀects using Vainshtein [2] mechanism, the problems due to
vDVZ discontinuity can be solved out. But the massive gravity theory in this nonlinear
situation, losses the momentum constraints as well as the Hamiltonian constraints and
they lead to a situation where the gravity suﬀers from an instability known as the
Boulware-Deser (BD)ghost [3], as a result of an extra degree of freedom other than the

Geometrothermodynamics of Charged black holes in Massive Gravity

2

ﬁve degrees of freedom of a massive spin-2 ﬁeld in a Poincare invariant background.
Recently de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley (dRGT) [5, 6] has introduced a theory which is
free from the BD ghost. The dGRT theory consists of a three parameter family of
potentials, which in turn produce a dynamical constraint which can be used to remove
the degree of freedom which acts as the BD ghost. Even the absence of BD ghost does
not make the theory consistent in every manner, the diﬀeomorphism invariance broken
due to mass term was one of the major problem. The St¨uckelberg mechanism [7] can
be used to overcome this situation. It can be done by introducing four auxiliary scalars
φA(x) via ¯gµν → ∂µφA∂νφBηAB. Using this pure gauge St¨uckelberg ﬁeld, the original
theory, the general relativity can be recovered using a unitary gauge, φA = δA
µ xµ. Hence
this nonlinear St¨uckelberg formalism brings back the diﬀeomorphism invariance.

Various black hole and cosmological solutions of the massive gravity theory are
intensively studied in recent years. Black holes receive attention of the many, as
they are identiﬁed as thermodynamic objects with a physical temperature and entropy
[8, 9, 10] as well as there exist an analogy between black hole system and the non
gravitational thermodynamic system [11]. Hence exploring the thermodynamics of
black holes will eventually give many ideas regarding the corresponding gravity theory
of the black hole system. The analysis of black hole phase transitions, which are
entropically driven in Einstein’s theory, but depends on other parameters in modiﬁed
theories are of prime importance in black hole thermodynamic studies. Black hole phase
transition studies can be done in two ways. One, by calculating the heat capacity of
black hole space time and there by studying the transition between thermodynamically
stable phase and unstable phase. The second method is by incorporating diﬀerential
geometry ideas in to black hole thermodynamics. Recently, this geometric method
gained attention, since it can be used as a convenient tool to study the thermodynamics
and the corresponding phase transition structures of black holes. Various investigations
are done by incorporating the idea of contact geometry in to the study of black hole
thermodynamics [12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. The recent method in this context is a new
geometric formalism, known as the Geometrothermodynamics proposed by Quevedo
et.al [17, 18, 19]. This method can give exact explanations for all the thermodynamic
behaviors as well as the exact phase structure of black hole systems.

A brief outline of the paper is as follows:

in Section 2, we review the
ideas of geometrothermodynamics. We explain the charged black hole solutions in
massive gravity and calculate the relevant thermodynamic quantities like the horizon
temperature, entropy and the speciﬁc heat in Section 3. Geometrothermodynamic
method for analyzing the phase transition picture are depicted in Section 4. The results
are summarized in Section 5

2. Black Holes in Massive Gravity

The massive gravity model which is used in this paper can be described using the action

where the ﬁrst term is the usual Einstein-Hilbert action and the second term is arising
from the contributions of mass of the graviton m, and from the nonlinear higher
derivative term U corresponding to the massive graviton. It is given by

U = U2 + α3U3 + α4U4,

where,

U2 = [K]2 − [K2]
U3 = [K]3 − [K][K2] + 2[K3]
U4 = [K]4 − 6[K]2[K2] + 8[K3][K] − 6[K4].

In the above set of equations, the tensor Kµ

ν is deﬁned as,

ν −(cid:113)

Kµ
ν = δµ

∂µφα∂νφβfαβ,

where φα and φβ are the corresponding Stu¨ckelberg ﬁeld and fαβ is a ﬁxed symmetric
tensor usually called as the reference metric.
In the unitary gauge, deﬁned as φa = xa, the term hµν = gµν − ηµν is the
gravitational analog of the Proca ﬁeld of massive electrodynamics [22]. By introducing
the St¨uckelberg ﬁeld φa, which can be considered as background ﬁeld plus a pion
contribution, φa = xa + πa[21], and replacing the Minkowski metric by,

gµν = ∂µφa∂νφbηab + Hµν,

where Hµν is the covariantized metric perturbation, one can restore the Diﬀeomorphism
invariance. As given in [21, 22], two new coeﬃcients α and β are introduced which relate
the coeﬃcients α3 and α4 in (2) by,

In empty space, the equation of motion is given as,

Gµν + m2Xµν = 0,

where Xµν is the eﬀective energy-momentum tensor contributed by the graviton mass

Now applying the Bianchi identity, ∇µGµν = 0 in (7), we arrive at the constraint
equation,

Using (7), (8) and (9), a spherically symmetric and time independent metric in de Sitter
space can be obtained, by choosing,

m2Xµν = λgµν,

where λ is a constant. The solutions of (7) that satisﬁes the condition given in (11) with

(24)

It is interesting to note that, the charged black hole solution in massive gravity (18)
with m as the mass of the graviton can act as Reissner- Nordstr¨om solution in de-Sitter
and anti de-Sitter space time in massive gravity with respect to the choice of curvature
parameter α. We can see that (18) will reduce to RNdS solution in massive gravity
for α > 0, for α < 0 we can obtain RNAdS solution and the RN solution in Einstein’s
general relativity for mass of the graviton m = 0.

Before going in to the details of phase transition structure of charged black holes
in massive gravity, let us consider the physics of the curvature parameter α in details.
From the black hole space time metric (18), and comparing it with the charged dS or
AdS black hole in Einstein’s gravity theory, one can easily identify the cosmological
constant term in massive gravity as,

Λ =

m2
α

.

(25)

We know that in most black hole thermodynamic studies, the cosmological constant is
treated as a ﬁxed parameter. But it has been suggested that it is better to treat Λ as a
thermodynamic variable [24, 25]. In many studies, this cosmological constant is treated

Geometrothermodynamics of Charged black holes in Massive Gravity

6

as the thermodynamic variable, the pressure [26, 27]. Accordingly the cosmological
constant generated pressure can be written as,

P = − Λ
8πG

.

(26)

From (25), one can rewrite the pressure generated by cosmological constant in massive
gravity as,

P = − m2
8πα

.

(27)

Hence the choice of curvature parameter α will determine whether the space time is de
Sitter or anti de Sitter. The presence of negative pressure, by choosing the curvature
parameter as positive, point towards the accelerated expansion of the present universe.
Further studies in this direction may lead to a better understanding of this phenomenon.
Throughout this paper we consider the dependency of curvature parameter on the
thermodynamic behaviors hence indirectly the eﬀects of cosmological constant and
pressure.

holes for ﬂat, spherical and hyperbolic topology of space time in massive gravity

2.1. Charged de-Sitter black hole in massive gravity

Let us consider the case where the curvature parameter is taken to be positive (α > 0),
then the black hole solution given by (18) reduces to charged de-Sitter solution in massive
gravity (RNdS). Now the variation of temperature and speciﬁc heat with entropy of
RNdS black hole is plotted for diﬀerent space time in ﬁgures (1) and (2).

From ﬁgure (1) we can see that for the ﬂat case (k = 0), the temperature is
always negative, and hence has no physical signiﬁcance. For the spherically symmetric

Geometrothermodynamics of Charged black holes in Massive Gravity

7

Figure 2. 3D Variation of heat capacity against entropy and charge for de-Sitter black
holes for ﬂat, spherical and hyperbolic topology of space time in massive gravity

space time case (k = 1), the temperature initially enters in to a physically insigniﬁcant
region (with negative temperature) and lies in a positive region for intermediate sized
black holes. For black holes with larger horizon radius it again goes to the negative
temperature regions. For the hyperbolic space time case (k = −1), the behaviour
exactly resembles that of ﬂat space time. So for the RNdS case in massive gravity for
spherically symmetric space time, there exists a window at which the black hole has
positive temperatures and hence lies in a physically signiﬁcant region.

The variation of heat capacity depicted in ﬁgure (2) shows that, black hole
undergoes phase transitions for all the cases, k = 0, 1,−1. For ﬂat and hyperbolic space
time cases, the black hole lies in a thermodynamically unstable phase and undergoes
a inﬁnite discontinuity and become thermodynamically stable. But for spherically
symmetric space time, the black hole goes from thermodynamically stable region to
an unstable region at many points including the inﬁnite discontinuity transitions for
black hole with lower horizon radius.

2.2. Charged anti de-Sitter black hole in massive gravity

In this section we will consider the case in which the curvature parameter is taken as
negative (α < 0). For this case the the black hole solution (18) reduces to charged anti
de Sitter solution in massive gravity (RNAdS). Here also variation of temperature and
speciﬁc heat against entropy for diﬀerent space time cases are depicted in ﬁgure (3) and
(4).

Temperature variation in ﬁgures (3), implies that for each space time cases, the
black hole changes from unphysical region to a region which has physical signiﬁcance.

Figure 4. 3D Variation of heat capacity against entropy and charge for anti de-Sitter
black holes for ﬂat, spherical and hyperbolic topology of space time in massive gravity

But for the spherically symmetric space time case, the temperature goes to a maximum
positive value and falls down to lower values. Hence a temperature window-like
behaviour is shown by these black holes too. From the ﬁgures (4) we can infer that
the for the ﬂat case, the speciﬁc heat goes from negative values to positive values and
hence the black hole system changes from a thermodynamically unstable phase to a
stable phase without any phase transitions. This behaviour exactly resembles that of

Geometrothermodynamics of Charged black holes in Massive Gravity

Figure 5. 3D Variation of temperature against entropy and charge for black holes in
Einstein’s general relativity for ﬂat, spherical and hyperbolic topology of space time

RNdS black holes. This resemblance exists in the hyperbolic space time case too. For the
spherically symmetric case, the black hole initially lies in a thermodynamically unstable
region and transit to a stable phase. Later it undergoes a phase transition in which the
stable black hole becomes an unstable one.

2.3. Charged black holes in Einstein’s general relativity

Now let us consider the situation that the graviton has no mass (m = 0), then the black
hole system given by (18) will reduce to a charged black hole solution in Einstein’s
general relativity, i.e., Reissner-Nordstr¨om black hole solution. For m = 0 case, one can
write down the metric f (r) from (18) as,

f (r) = k − rg
r

+

˜Q2
˜α2r2 .

(28)

It is evident from the above equation that,
it exactly matches with the Reissner-
Nordstr¨om black hole solution in Einstein’s general relativity.
Solving the above
equation (28), and using the relation Q ≡ ˜Q/˜α, one can easily write the mass of the
black hole as,

M =

√
πQ2 + kS

.

(29)

From the usual thermodynamic relations T = ∂M
temperature and heat capacity respectively as,

∂S and C = T ∂S

∂T one can write

and

C =

2S(−πQ2 + kS)

3πQ2 − kS

.

(31)

The variation of both temperature and heat capacity are plotted. From the ﬁgures (5)
and (6), we can see that for ﬂat case (k = 0) as well as for the hyperbolic (k = −1) case
temperature always lies in the negative value region and hence in physically insigniﬁcant
region. Now for the spherically symmetric space time case (k = 1), black hole initially
lies in a negative temperature region and as the black hole horizon radius increases it
goes to a maximum temperature value. After the maximum value of temperature is
attained it lies in the positive temperature region itself. We can see that when mass
of the graviton becomes zero, it exactly reproduces the results of RN black holes. So
the limiting case of RNdS or RNAdS black hole in massive gravity coincides with RN
solution in Einstein’s theory and their thermodynamic behaviour gives the proof for the
same.

3. Geometrothermodynamics of charged black holes in massive gravity

To investigate the mathematical structure of thermodynamic systems,
it is very
convenient to use contact geometry.
In order to incorporate the idea of diﬀerential
geometry, one has to ﬁrst deﬁne a 2n + 1 thermodynamic phase space (T ). This phase
space is coordinated by the set Z a = {Φ, Ea, I a}, where Φ is an arbitrary thermodynamic
potential, the coordinates Ea correspond to the extensive variables and I a are the
corresponding dual intensive variables, where a = 1, ..., n. We can introduce the contact

Geometrothermodynamics of Charged black holes in Massive Gravity

11

1-form or fundamental Gibbs 1-form as [12],

Θ = dΦ − δabI adEb, δab = diag(1, 1, , .., 1),

(32)
with summation over the repeated indices. Now if T is diﬀerentiable and Θ satisﬁes the
condition Θ∧ (dΘ)n (cid:54)= 0, then (T , Θ) can be called as a contact manifold. Now consider
an n dimensional manifold E, which is a sub manifold of T , i.e., E ⊂ T , which can be
deﬁned using the extensive thermodynamic variables Ea. This equilibrium manifold E
can be realized by considering a smooth harmonic mapping ϕ : E → T ,

ϕ : E(cid:97) → {Z a(Ea)} = {Φ(Ea), Ea, I a(Ea)},

and the condition E ⊂ T , can be realized using the condition,

(33)

ϕ∗(Θ) = ϕ∗(dΦ − δabI adEb) = 0,

(34)
where ϕ∗ is the pullback. From the relation (34) one can easily deduce the condition
for thermodynamic equilibrium as,

∂Φ
∂Ea = δabI b.

(35)
Considering the equilibrium manifold E and using (34), the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics
can be written as,

ϕ∗(Θ) = ϕ∗(dΦ − δab I a dEb) = 0 .

(36)

The harmonic map ϕ demands the existence of the function Φ = Φ(Ea), which is
commonly known as the fundamental equation in classical thermodynamics from which
one can deduce all the equation of states corresponding to that system. From this
fundamental equation, one can write the second law of thermodynamics as,

± ∂2Φ
∂Ea∂Eb ≥ 0,

(37)

also known as the convexity condition. In the above equation, the sign depends on the
choice of the thermodynamic potential. For example, if one chooses Φ as entropy, then
the sign becomes positive and it becomes negative when the potential is chosen to be
the internal energy. Now let us consider a Riemannian metric G on T , which must
be invariant with respect to Legendre transformations. Then the Riemannian contact
manifold can be deﬁned as the set (T , Θ, G) and the equilibrium manifold can be written
as a sub manifold of T , i.e., E ⊂ T . This sub manifold satisﬁes the above discussed
pull back condition [20]. The non-degenerate metric G and the thermodynamic metric
g can be written as,

G = (dΦ − δabI adEb)2 + (δabEaI b)(ηcddEcdI d),

and,

gQ = ϕ∗(G) =

with ηab=diag(-1,1,1,..,1) and this metric is Legendre invariant because of the invariance
of the Gibbs 1-form. Now by calculating the curvature scalar of the GTD metric(39),

Geometrothermodynamics of Charged black holes in Massive Gravity

12

one can use GTD as a method to investigate the phase transition structure of the black
hole system.

In this section we investigate the phase transition of the charged black hole solution
in massive gravity by using the concept of Geometrothermodynamics (GTD). Now we
will introduce the ideas of GTD in to the charged black hole system in massive gravity.
For this, we will construct a 7 dimensional thermodynamic phase space T using the
extensive variables and their dual intensive variables as coordinates.
In the present
case, coordinates are given by Z A = {M, S, Q, α, T, φ, a}, where S, Q, α are extensive
variables and T, φ, a are their corresponding dual intensive variables. Now one can write
the Gibbs 1-form as,

Θ = dM − T dS − φdQ − adα.

(40)

Now using the idea of equilibrium manifold, one can write the GTD metric as,

g = (SMS + QMQ + αMα)

 −MSS

Then, the Legendre invariant scalar curvature corresponding to the above metric is given
by,

RGT D =

(πα (kS − 3πQ2) + 2m2S2)2 (2m2S2 − 3πα (kS + 3πQ2))3

f (S, Q, α)

(41)

where f (S, Q, α) is a complicated expression of less physical interest. Now we will
investigate the thermodynamic behaviour of the black hole system using the scalar
curvature. According to the theory of Geometrothermodynamics, the points of zero
scalar curvature as well as the inﬁnite discontinuities will exactly matches with the
singular behaviours of thermodynamic potentials which corresponds to the black hole
system. Now let us evaluate diﬀerent charged black hole system in massive gravity, as
they vary with respect to mass of the graviton, topology of the solutions and the sign of
the curvature parameter. The variation of Ricci scalar curvature with entropy is depicted
in ﬁgures (7) and (8). Let us ﬁrst consider the case in which the curvature parameter, α is
taken as positive, then as we have discussed earlier, the black hole system will behave like
charged de-Sitter black hole system. From the ﬁgures (7) it is evident that, all singular
points in the thermodynamic parameters like temperature and heat capacity are exactly
reproduced by the Ricci scalar either by vanishing or showing inﬁnite discontinuities at
the same points. For the second case also Ricci scalar behaves in a similar manner, where
the curvature parameter, α is taken as negative, and hence the the black hole system
becomes a charged anti de-Sitter black hole system. The variation of scalar curvature for
this case is plotted in ﬁgures (8). Now let us investigate the Geometrothermodynamics
and the behaviour of Legendre invariant scalar curvature of the black hole system, when
the mass oﬀ the graviton becomes zero. The corresponding variation of Ricci scalar is
depicted in ﬁgure (9) and (10). Here too, the singularities of the Ricci scalar matches
with those of temperature and heat capacity of the RN black hole in Einstein’s general

relativity. It is interesting to note that the GTD results obtained from the charged black
hole solution in massive gravity coincides with the study of RN black hole previously
obtained in [28, 29]. Hence the Geometrothermodynamics exactly reproduces the phase
transition structure of the charged black hole solutions in massive gravity.

4. Results and Discussion

In this paper, we have studied the black hole thermodynamics and geometrothermody-
namics of the charged de-Sitter and anti de-Sitter solutions in massive gravity. The main
aim of this paper is to discuss the phase transition as well as the singular behaviours
in thermodynamic potentials using GTD method. We used the Quevedo metric or
GTD metric to obtain the Legendre invariant Ricci scalar curvature. We analysed the
thermodynamic behaviour using both analytical and graphical methods. The analysis
showed that, the singular behaviours in the thermodynamic potentials, including the
point where heat capacity diverges, exactly reproduced by the Ricci scalar obtained us-
ing the GTD metric. Hence we can say that, GTD metric exactly reproduces the phase
transition structure of charged black holes in massive gravity and their corresponding
thermodynamic interactions. From this study it is evident that the charged black holes
in massive gravity undergoes a phase transition. Also the present study reveals that, like
all other charged black hole solutions in Einstein’s gravity and in all modiﬁed gravities,
there exists a temperature window, where the black hole temperature lies in a physically
signiﬁcant region with positive temperature.
