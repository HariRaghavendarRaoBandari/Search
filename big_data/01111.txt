We study the dynamics of excitons in GaAs/(Al,Ga)As core-shell nanowires by continuous-wave and time-
resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy. Strong Al segregation in the shell of the nanowires leads to the
formation of Ga-rich inclusions acting as quantum dots. At 10 K, intense light emission associated with these
shell quantum dots is observed. The average radiative lifetime of excitons conﬁned in the shell quantum dots
is 1.7 ns. We show that excitons may tunnel toward adjacent shell quantum dots and nonradiative point de-
fects. We investigate the changes in the dynamics of charge carriers in the shell with increasing temperature,
with particular emphasis on the transfer of carriers from the shell to the core of the nanowires. We ﬁnally dis-
cuss the implications of carrier localization in the (Al,Ga)As shell for fundamental studies and optoelectronic
applications based on core-shell III-As nanowires.

INTRODUCTION

The relaxation and recombination dynamics of charge car-
riers in semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) has attracted
much attention1,2 due to its consequences on the radia-
tive efﬁciency of these zero-dimensional systems, which are
used in quantum dot lasers3 or single-photon and entangled-
photon pair emitters.4,5 In particular, the interplay between
the radiative decay of the exciton and the capture and escape
of carriers from the QD controls the intensity, the lifetime,
and the linewidth of the optical transitions related to the
QD.6–9 In most cases, QDs form the lowest energy states of
a given system.1,2,10 Charge carriers excited nonresonantly
in a continuum of states (e.g., the wetting layer for Stranski-
Krastanov QDs) relax via phonon emission toward the QD,
where they recombine radiatively. In striking contrast, there
have been recent reports on new kinds of QD states lying
hundreds of meV above the minimum of a continuum of
states and yet giving rise to intense light emission at low
temperatures.11,12 These QDs consist of Ga-rich inclusions
that form spontaneously in the shells of GaAs/(Al,Ga)As
core-shell nanowires as a result of differences in chemi-
cal potential and adatom mobilities between the {111} and
{112} facets of the nanowires.11,13 In addition to the fact that
they are bright single photon emitters, these so-called shell
QDs are also suited for nano-sensing and opto-mechanical
applications as they are located close to the surface and off-
axis of the nanowires.11,14 For all these applications, how-
ever, the shell QDs need to be populated by an exciton. For
this purpose, one requires detailed knowledge on the dynam-
ics of shell QD excitons and, in particular, on how efﬁcient
the radiative decay of shell QD excitons is as compared to
their transfer to the GaAs core of the nanowires.

In this paper, we investigate the relaxation and re-
combination dynamics of charge carriers in core-shell
GaAs/(Al,Ga)As nanowires by continuous-wave and time-
resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy. At 10 K, shell
QDs can bind excitons and biexcitons that give rise to intense
transitions in the 1.7 eV range. With increasing tempera-
ture, we observe a drastic quenching of the emission from
the shell QDs. This quenching arises from the thermal ac-
tivation of two nonradiative channels, which are associated
with recombination at point defects in the shells and transfer

of carriers from the shell to the core of the nanowire. We
determine the characteristic times for the radiative and non-
radiative decay channels of excitons in shell QDs, and we
analyze their evolution with temperature.

II. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

The nanowires were grown by solid-source molecular
beam epitaxy on an n-type Si(111) substrate.
Prior to
growth, the substrate was annealed in the growth chamber
for 10 min at 650 °C. The substrate temperature was then
decreased to 630 °C, after which Ga was deposited for 30 s
at a GaAs equivalent growth rate of 0.44 monolayer/s of Ga
in the lattice structure of GaAs, and the substrate was sub-
sequently annealed for 60 s to form droplets. The growth
of GaAs nanowires was initiated by supplying Ga and As2
for 50 min with ﬂuxes of 0.11 and 0.75 monolayer/s, respec-
tively. To stop the axial growth, the Ga ﬂux was interrupted,
and the Ga droplet was consumed at a low As2 ﬂux, while
the substrate temperature was decreased to 500 °C. Finally,
a 30 nm thick Al0.25Ga0.75As shell was grown using a com-
bined group-III ﬂux of 0.6 monolayer/s and a V/III ratio of 5.
The average length and diameter of our nanowires are 2 µm
and 120 nm, respectively.

Continuous-wave photoluminescence experiments were
performed using a HeNe laser emitting at 632.8 nm. For
experiments on nanowire ensembles, the laser was focused
onto the sample using a plano-convex lens with a focal
length of 5 cm, and the excitation power was varied be-
tween 0.005 and 6.6 mW. For single nanowire experiments,
the laser light was focused using a microscope objective
with a numerical aperture of 0.7, and the excitation power
was varied between 57 nW and 8.1 mW. The photolumines-
cence signal was dispersed using a monochromator with a
spectral resolution of 0.5 meV and detected by a charge-
coupled device camera. Time-resolved photoluminescence
spectroscopy was carried out using fs pulses obtained from
an optical parametric oscillator pumped by a Ti:sapphire
laser. The emission wavelength and repetition rate were
632.8 nm and 76 MHz, respectively, and the energy ﬂuence
per pulse was kept below 0.7 µJ /cm2. The transient emission
was spectrally dispersed by a monochromator and detected

both continuous-wave and time-resolved photoluminescence
measurements, the samples were mounted in a coldﬁnger

300 K.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Figure 1 shows a typical photoluminescence spectrum
of an ensemble of GaAs/(Al,Ga)As core-shell nanowires
at 10 K for excitation powers between 0.005 and 6.6 mW.
Two distinct bands centered around 1.5 and 1.7 eV are de-
tected. We attribute the intense band at about 1.5 eV to
carrier recombination in the GaAs core. For an excitation
power of 0.005 mW, the emission from the core is cen-
tered at 1.505 eV and arises from recombination within poly-
typic nanowire segments.15 For larger excitation powers, this
emission band blueshifts, as a result of ﬁlling of the states re-
lated to the polytypic segments, and is centered at 1.529 eV
for the highest excitation power. The latter energy is sig-
niﬁcantly larger than the bandgap of strain-free zincblende
GaAs (1.519 eV). Although not understood yet, this behav-
ior has been commonly reported for GaAs nanowires (see
Ref. 16 for a detailed discussion). At high excitation pow-
ers, the band on the high-energy side of the photolumines-
cence line from the GaAs core is centered at 1.717 eV and
exhibits a linewidth of 53 meV. Decreasing the excitation
power reveals that this band is actually composed of sev-
eral tens of narrow transitions with a typical linewidth on
the order of 1 meV, arising from the recombination of charge
carriers conﬁned at localized states in the (Al,Ga)As shells
of the nanowires.11,12,17 In agreement with the results of
Refs. 11, 12, and 18, we attribute these localized states to
Ga-rich inclusions that form spontaneously in the (Al,Ga)As
shells.

To gain insight into the electronic properties of these so-
called shell QDs, we have performed single nanowire spec-
troscopy. Figure 2(a) shows the (Al,Ga)As shell lumines-
cence from a single nanowire for an excitation power of
57 nW. When excited at this low excitation power, this
nanowire exhibits only a few transitions between 1.7 and
1.8 eV. The linewidth of these individual lines is on the or-
der of 1 meV, which is orders of magnitude larger than the
value expected for the radiative linewidth of an exciton in a
shell QD.12 This linewidth is also signiﬁcantly larger than
the ﬁne-structure splitting reported for shell QDs in Ref. 12.
Using the result of Ref. 19 that shell QDs in the ﬁrst 20 nm of
the shells are optically inactive and considering the fact that
the shell thickness in our nanowires is 30 nm, the shell QDs
giving rise to the transitions observed in Figs. 1 and 2(a) are
most likely located close to the surface.19 The actual con-
ﬁning potential in the shell QDs is thus not only given by
the spatial distribution of Al in the shells, but also by the
surface potential arising from the Fermi level pinning at the
nanowire sidewalls.20 Therefore, we tentatively attribute the
large emission linewidth of our shell QDs to spectral dif-
fusion due to electrostatic ﬂuctuations arising from photo-

induced changes in the surface states of the nanowires.21

Figure 2(b) shows the evolution with excitation power of
the photoluminescence at 10 K from a shell QD emitting
at 1.7504 eV. The evolution of the intensity with excita-
tion power of the transitions related to this QD is shown in
Fig. 2(c). For excitation powers not exceeding 22 µW, the
photoluminescence intensity of the transition at 1.7504 eV
increases nearly linearly with excitation power [Fig. 2(c)],
indicating that this line arises from the recombination of
a neutral exciton bound to a shell QD. For higher excita-
tion powers, the intensity of the exciton saturates as a result
of the ﬁnite number of states available and eventually de-
creases due to laser-induced heating. For excitation powers
larger than 1.4 µW, an additional line at 1.7469 eV whose in-
tensity increases quadratically with the intensity of the neu-
tral exciton is detected, demonstrating its biexcitonic nature
[Figs. 2(b) and 2(c)]. We deduce that the biexciton bind-
ing energy in our shell QDs is 3.5 meV, a value signiﬁcantly
lower than the 6 meV reported for (Al,Ga)As shells with an
average Al content of 51%.12 Since the biexciton binding
energy increases with localization depth,22 we ascribe the
weaker biexciton binding in our shell QDs to the lower av-
erage Al content in the shells of our nanowires (25%).

Despite the fact that the discrete electronic states associ-
ated with the shell QDs lie approximately 200 meV above
the continuum of states related to the GaAs core, they mani-
fest themselves in an intense photoluminescence signal (see
Fig. 1 as well as Refs. 11 and 12). This fact indicates that
the escape of excitons from the QDs to the GaAs core is
signiﬁcantly slower than their recombination. In addition,
shell QDs may exhibit some mixing between heavy-hole and
light-hole states.12 As a result of the antenna effect, the ex-
traction efﬁciency may thus be larger for the light emitted by
the shell QDs than for the one from the GaAs core.23

For obtaining a detailed understanding of the transfer dy-
namics of carriers in GaAs/(Al,Ga)As core-shell nanowires,
we have performed temperature-dependent experiments.
Figure 3(a) shows the temperature dependence of the pho-
toluminescence from a nanowire ensemble for an excitation
power of 6.6 mW. As displayed in Fig. 3(b), the photolu-
minescence energy of the GaAs core redshifts monotoni-
cally with increasing temperature.
Its temperature depen-
dence can be described well by the expressions derived by
P¨assler 24 with the parameters recommended in Ref. 25 for
bulk GaAs. This ﬁnding, however, is most probably for-
tuitous. As shown in Fig. 3(a), a different behavior is ob-
served when using an excitation power of 0.68 mW. The
temperature dependence of the photoluminescence energy
of GaAs grown in the form of nanowires therefore depends
not only on the lattice structure26 and on the detailed growth
conditions,16 but also on the excitation power. The energy of
the transitions associated with the shell QDs remains nearly
constant between 9 and 100 K. This deviation from the tem-
perature dependence of the gap has been commonly reported
for disordered systems15,27 and conﬁrms that in this tem-
perature range transfer processes of excitons occur within
a band of localized states in the (Al,Ga)As shell.

Figure 3(c) shows the evolution of the integrated photo-
luminescence intensity as a function of temperature of the
GaAs core and of the shell QDs. The former is almost con-
stant between 10 and 50 K and decreases for higher temper-
atures. This quenching arises from the combined decrease
in the radiative recombination rate of carriers in the core and
from the activation of a nonradiative recombination channel
with activation energy EA. Since the core diameter is 60 nm,
the GaAs core exhibits a three-dimensional density of states,
and the temperature dependence of its emission intensity Ic
can thus be written as

where a is a ﬁt parameter. As shown in Fig. 3(c), the data
are ﬁt well up to 200 K with EA = (16 ± 3) meV. This
value coincides with those reported in Refs. 28 and 29 for
GaAs/(Al,Ga)As core-shell nanowires, despite different fab-
rication routes and different nanowire lengths, shell thick-
nesses, and Al contents. The fact that the photolumines-
cence intensity of all of these samples quenches with the
same activation energy strongly suggests a common micro-

scopic origin for the nonradiative process in these structures.
Considering the small diameter of the GaAs core, we be-
lieve it is likely that a speciﬁc recombination center at the
GaAs/(Al,Ga)As {110} interfaces controls this process.

The photoluminescence intensity of the shell QDs (IQD)
also decreases with increasing temperature. However, the
overall quenching with temperature is much stronger for IQD
the ratio IQD/Ic decreases from 9 × 10−2 to
than for Ic:
1.5× 10−3 when the temperature increases from 9 to 140 K.
This behavior is similar to what has been reported for pla-
nar quantum well with disordered barriers:18,30 while tran-
sitions related to the quantum well and the barriers are de-
tected at low temperatures, an increase in temperature leads
to an increase in the efﬁciency in carrier capture and to a
fast quenching of the barrier luminescence intensity. Ac-
cordingly, we ascribe the strong decrease in IQD/Ic to an in-
creasingly efﬁcient carrier transfer from the shell to the core
with increasing temperature. In other words, for tempera-
tures larger than 50 K, the characteristic time for the capture
of carriers by the core is signiﬁcantly shorter than the ra-

diative lifetime of the shell QDs. The reduction in carrier
transfer time with increasing temperature brings the distri-
bution of carriers in the nanowires closer to quasi thermal
equilibrium, giving rise to the decrease in IQD/Ic observed in
Figs. 3(a) and 3(c). To ﬁt the temperature dependence of IQD
in Fig. 3(c), we account for two thermally activated nonra-
diative recombination channels with activation energies EA1
and EA2, corresponding to the nonradiative recombination at
point defects within the shell and to the transfer of carriers
from the shell to the core, respectively. The activation energy
EA2 can also be seen as the localization energy of carriers in
the (Al,Ga)As shells. As the radiative lifetime for the shell
QDs remains constant with temperature, we obtain

genic temperatures, they have enough thermal energy above
50 K to escape the QDs and recombine in the GaAs core.

The continuous-wave experiments in Fig. 3 only provide
qualitative knowledge on the dynamics of carriers in shell
QDs. Time-resolved photoluminescence experiments are
needed to obtain quantitative information on the radiative
lifetime of excitons in shell QDs and on the efﬁciency of
the carrier transfer from the (Al,Ga)As shell to the GaAs
core of the nanowires. Figures 4(a)–4(c) display time-
resolved photoluminescence streak camera images at 10 K
on an ensemble of nanowires for various excitation densi-
ties [energy ﬂuence per pulse of 0.7, 0.09 and 0.012 µJ/cm2
in Figs. 4(a), 4(b) and 4(c), respectively]. An exponen-
tial ﬁt to the spectrally integrated photoluminescence from
the GaAs core after long delays yields a decay time of
about 800 ps. This decay time corresponds to a recombi-
nation velocity of 1900 cm/s at the GaAs/(Al,Ga)As{110}
interface. This value is more than an order of magnitude
larger than the recombination velocities achieved for state-

of-the-art GaAs/(Al,Ga)As{100} interfaces,31 but similar to
the one previously reported for GaAs/(Al,Ga)As core-shell
nanowires.32 This result is thus consistent with the hypothe-
sis that the nonradiative process observed in Fig. 3(c) for the
GaAs core is governed by interface recombination.

The photoluminescence bands at zero delay of both the
GaAs core and the shell QDs strongly blueshift with in-
creasing excitation density. Fitting with an exponential the
high-energy tail of the GaAs photoluminescence spectrum
at zero time delay taken with an energy ﬂuence per pulse
of 0.7 µJ/cm2, we ﬁnd that the effective carrier tempera-
ture at the early stage of the decay is about 300 K. The
photoluminescence spectrum of the GaAs core at zero time
delay is thus dominated by hot carrier luminescence.33,34
With increasing time delay, the GaAs core transition red-
shifts, and its high-energy tail gets steeper, as a result of
the cooling of carriers. We estimate that for a 1 µm thick
GaAs epilayer, excitation at 632.8 nm with an energy ﬂu-
ence per pulse of 0.012, 0.09 and 0.7 µJ/cm2 corresponds

and 2.0× 1014 cm−3, respectively. As shown in Ref. 35, a
nanowire with a cross-section S exhibits an enhanced light
absorption compared to the bulk. This absorption enhance-
ment is given by the ratio between the power absorbed by
the nanowire and the product of the incident power surface
density with S. The absorption enhancement for light with
a wavelength of 632.8 nm and polarized perpendicular to a
GaAs nanowire with a diameter of 120 nm is equal to 50.35
Assuming that photogenerated carriers are homogeneously
distributed along the nanowire, the injected carrier densities
in the case of Figs. 4(a), 4(b) and 4(c) should not exceed
1.0 × 1016, 1.3 × 1015, and 1.7 × 1014 cm−3, respectively.
Even the ﬁrst of these densities is rather moderate, and the
blueshift of about 100 meV in Fig. 4(a) is thus rather sur-
prising. Moreover, the cooling is seen to take place on un-
usually long time scales. For example, despite the very low
initial carrier density corresponding to an energy ﬂuence per
pulse of 0.12 µJ/cm2, it takes 1 ns for the emission from
the GaAs core to reach the energy of strain-free zincblende
GaAs [Fig. 4(c)]. This ﬁnding suggests that the cooling of
carriers in GaAs nanowires is drastically slower than in the
bulk. The above bandgap emission observed in Fig. 1 and
often reported for continuous-wave excitation in the litera-
ture (for an overview, see Ref. 16) could thus simply arise
from hot carrier luminescence. However, even when using
a weak continuous-wave excitation, the luminescence of the
GaAs core of our nanowires is broad (Fig. 1). This inhomo-
geneous broadening impedes the extraction of an effective
carrier temperature at long time delays and/or weak exci-
tation conditions. Further experiments are thus required to
ascertain whether the cooling rate of carriers is affected by
the nanowire geometry.

The energy dependence of the photoluminescence decay
time τPL of the shell QDs is displayed in Fig. 4(d) for an
energy ﬂuence per pulse of 0.09 and 0.7 µJ/cm2.
In both
cases, τPL increases with decreasing energy. In particular,
for an energy ﬂuence per pulse of 0.09 µJ/cm2, τPL is equal
to 30 ps at 1.790 eV and increases to 1.63 ns at 1.715 eV.
The behavior in Fig. 4(d) is characteristic of the transfer
of excitons between localized states,36 and it indicates that
even at low temperatures exciton transfer between adjacent
shell QDs is possible through tunneling assisted by acoustic
phonons. Following the formalism described in Ref. 36, the
energy dependence of τPL is given by

with τQD denoting the lifetime of the shell QD excitons in
the absence of any tunneling between adjacent QDs, E0 an
energy characteristic of the density of states of the shell QDs
and of the transfer probability of excitons between adjacent
shell QDs, and Em the energy at which the tunneling time is
equal to τQD. The best ﬁt to the data yields τQD = 1.7 ns,
Em = 1.735 eV, and E0 = 9 meV [Fig. 4(d)]. The charac-
teristic energy E0 agrees well with the activation energy EA1
measured for the initial quenching of the the emission from

6

the shell QDs in Fig. 3(c). This agreement conﬁrms that this
initial quenching is caused by a transfer of excitons within
the shell followed by their recombination at point defects,
rather than by an increase in the trapping efﬁciency of car-
riers by the core of the nanowires. Assuming that at 10 K
and for an energy ﬂuence per pulse of 0.09 µJ/cm2 τQD is
equal to the radiative lifetime τr of the shell QD exciton, we
obtain τr = 1.7 ns, a value signiﬁcantly larger than the value
reported in Ref 11.

As shown in Figs. 4(d) and 4(e), τPL at a given energy
decreases with increasing energy ﬂuence per pulse and tem-
perature, respectively. Since Em and E0 are characteristic for
the density of states of the shell QDs, we assume that they
are independent of excitation density and temperature be-
tween 10 and 100 K, and the whole set of data in Figs. 4(d)
and 4(e) can be ﬁt by only varying τQD. The value of τQD de-
creases from 1.73 to 0.50 ns with increasing energy ﬂuence,
and from 424 ps to 38 ps with increasing temperature. We
attribute both of these results to an increase in the efﬁciency
of nonradiative recombination at point defects and in carrier
transfer from the shell to the core with increasing excitation
density and temperature.

Figure 5(a) summarizes our understanding of the dynam-
ics of excitons in core-shell GaAs/(Al,Ga)As nanowires.
The lifetime τQD measured in Figs. 4(d) and 4(e) depends
on the radiative lifetime τr, on the nonradiative lifetime at
point defects τnr, and on the characteristic transfer time τt of
carriers from the shell to the core. Therefore, τQD is given
by

The radiative lifetime for an exciton in a QD is in-
dependent of temperature. Therefore and as shown in
Fig. 5(b), we can calculate the temperature dependence of

(cid:1)−1 from Eq. (4), which is displayed in

Tnr =(cid:0)τ−1

nr + τ−1

Fig. 5(b). At 10 K and for an energy ﬂuence per pulse of
0.7 µJ/cm2, Tnr = 564 ps. Since the nonradiative decay at
point defects is the nonradiative channel with the smallest
activation energy [Fig. 3(c)], we deduce that τnr ≈ 564 ps.
Since this value is much smaller than τr, the decay of ex-
citons in shell QDs under high excitation is dominated by
nonradiative recombination already at 10 K. Between 10 and
40 K, Tnr remains almost constant, indicating that τnr is con-
stant as well and that τt (cid:29) τnr. However, for temperatures
larger than 50 K, τQD decreases strongly. Since the trans-
fer of carriers to the core is activated for temperatures larger
than 50 K [Fig. 3(c)], τQD ≈ τt in this temperature range, and
we ﬁnd that τt < 40 ps for temperatures higher than 100 K.

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We have described the dynamics of excitons in the shell
of GaAs/(Al,Ga)As core-shell nanowires. At low temper-
atures, excitons are trapped in the shells by spontaneously
formed quantum dots that result from inhomogeneities in the

FIG. 5. (color online) (a) Schematic representation of the recombination dynamics of excitons in the shell of GaAs/(Al,Ga)As nanowires
with shell QDs. The potential for excitons across the nanowire section is shown by the black solid line. Each arrow represents a different
recombination or transfer process of excitons. Arrows (1) and (2) represent the radiative and nonradiative recombination of the exciton
with characteristic lifetime τr and τnr, respectively. Arrow (3) stands for the QD-to-QD tunelling of excitons assisted by acoustic phonons
described by Eq. (3). Arrow (4) shows the thermally activated transfer of carriers from the shell to the core of the nanowire with character-
istic time τt. (b) Temperature dependence of τr (squares), Tnr (circles), and τQD (triangles). The dashed lines are a guide to the eye showing

Al content. These shell QD excitons give rise to intense lu-
minescence lines in the 1.7–1.8 eV range and exhibit a ra-
diative lifetime of 1.7 ns. While the transfer of carriers from
the shell to the core is inefﬁcient at 10 K, the characteristic
transfer time of carriers from a shell QD to the GaAs core
is faster than 40 ps for temperatures larger than 100 K, lead-
ing to the suppression of the shell QD photoluminescence
intensity. The carrier cooling rate in our nanowires appears
to be much slower than the one in bulk GaAs. This slow
cooling rate is possibly due to the fact that our nanowires are
polytypic37 and results in a pronounced dependence of the
shell QD exciton lifetime on the density of photogenerated
carriers.

The very fast transfer of carriers from the shell to the core
at elevated temperatures implies that the spontaneous forma-
tion of quantum dots in the (Al,Ga)As shells should not af-
fect the room temperature operation of light-emitting diodes
based on coaxial (In,Ga)As/(Al,Ga)As nanowires.38,39 In

contrast, at low temperatures, the shell QDs localize charge
carriers very efﬁciently. This localization is expected to be
detrimental for the formation of high-mobility electron chan-
nels along the nanowire40 as well as for fundamental studies
of quantum interference effects in nanowires.41 Finally, if
one desires to extend the application of shell QDs toward
higher temperatures, the carrier transfer must be inhibited or
at least slowed down as much as possible. A simple way to
achieve this goal might be the insertion of an AlAs blocking
layer in the form of an inner shell between the GaAs core
and the (Al,Ga)As outer shell.
