Morphological instability of a planar surface ([111], [011], or [001]) of an ultra-thin metal ﬁlm is
studied in a parameter space formed by three major eﬀects (QSE, the surface energy anisotropy
and the surface stress) that inﬂuence a ﬁlm dewetting. The analysis is based on the extended
Mullins equation, where the eﬀects are cast as functions of the ﬁlm thickness. The formulation of
quantum size eﬀect (Z. Zhang et al., PRL 80, 5381 (1998)) includes the oscillation of the surface
energy with thickness caused by electrons conﬁnement. By systematically comparing the eﬀects,
their contributions into the overall stability (or instability) is highlighted.

INTRODUCTION

Morphological instability of a surface of an ultra-thin solid ﬁlm and ﬁlm dewetting are important from the technology
viewpoint, as well as from the viewpoint of basic physics. These phenomena were intensely studied in a semiconductor-
on-semiconductor, metal-on-semiconductor, and metal-on-metal systems1–6. However, only for former systems were
the mathematical models suﬃciently developed and were able to help clarify the key mechanisms by which the ﬁlm
becomes unstable and dewets; see, for instance, Refs.8–13 and the references therein.

In this paper, building upon the just cited and closely related works, we develop the physico-mathematical model
for the analysis of a morphology evolution of an ultra-thin metal ﬁlms (thickness 5 to 30 monolayers (ML) (1.5-10
nm)) on a semiconductor or metal substrates. Our model accounts for three eﬀects that are believed to play a major
roles in a ﬁlm instability and dewetting: the quantum size eﬀect (QSE)2, surface energy anisotropy, and surface stress.
The advantage of a mathematical model is that it allows to separate the physical eﬀects and thus clarify the
contribution of each eﬀect in the overall picture. This is seldom possible in experiment. For instance, the role in
the initial surface instability of the surface energy that oscillates in the ﬁlm thickness2,4,6,7 was not studied in detail.
This paper partially ﬁlls this gap. We will refer to the surface energy oscillation as QSE oscillation. (Such oscillation
emerges primarily as a result of discreteness of the electronic energy bands due to the conﬁnement at the ﬁlm/vacuum
and ﬁlm/substrate interfaces. If the Fermi wavelength λF has a commensurate relation with the monolayer height
then, as the ﬁlm thickness grows, new bands emerge under Fermi level periodically, producing oscillations in the
interface energy with period around λF /2. Another source of surface energy oscillation is the Friedel oscillations in
the electron density, which result in an oscillatory mean-ﬁeld potential for electrons. The periodicity of the Friedel
oscillation is also around λF /2.)

To the best of our knowledge, the existing stability results2,3 for the ultra-thin metal ﬁlms are based on the analysis
of the second derivative (with respect to the ﬁlm thickness) of the free-energy function. Such analysis is not without
drawbacks, e.g., the perturbation wavelength and its characteristic development time scale are not easy to predict.
The partial diﬀerential equation (PDE)-based model allows not only the calculation of these quantities (that are
important in self-assembly), but also a computation of the evolution of the nano-pits15–17 and the retraction of the
ﬁlm edge18–20.

The paper proceeds as follows. In Sec. II we ﬁrst present the general form of the governing PDE; this PDE is the
classical Mullins’ surface diﬀusion equation, which includes three above-mentioned eﬀects.35 Then we focus on each
eﬀect separately and arrive to their mathematical formulations, that are next inserted into the governing PDE. In
Sec. III we employ a perturbation method and derive the ﬁnal form of the PDE. In this paper we present only those
terms of the PDE that contribute to the linearized form. The linear stability analysis (LSA) is performed in Sec. IV;
here we again focus separately on each eﬀect and then take a brief look at the situation where all three eﬀects are
present. Section V contains the conclusions.

II. PROBLEM FORMULATION

The starting point for the model is Mullins’ surface diﬀusion equation:

ht =

(1)

(2)

where h(x, y) is the height of the surface of the thin ﬁlm above the substrate, x, y the coordinates in the substrate
s the surface Laplacian, D = Ω2Dν/kT the diﬀusion constant (Ω is the adatom volume, D the adatom
plane, ∇2
diﬀusivity, ν the surface density of the adatoms, kT the Boltzmann’s factor), and µ = δ
δh
potential; here γ is the surface energy, δ
z be the coordinate normal to the substrate plane.

δh the functional derivative and the integral is over the ﬁlm surface. Also let

(cid:82) γ dS the chemical

Due to crystalline anisotropy, the surface energy depends on the surface orientation n, where

is the unit normal to the surface. QSE and the surface stress (discussed later in this section) introduce a dependence
of the surface energy on h, i.e. γ = γ(n, h). Then the calculation of the functional derivative leads to four-term
expression11 (see also Refs.9,10,12,13)

where κ is the curvature, n3 is seen in Eq. (2) and “wet”, “anis”, and “hot” are the short-hand notations for wetting,

and the surface energy in Eqs. (4)-(7) is the sum,

γ = γ(QSE) + γ(SS) + γ(Anis),

,

(8)

(9)

where the contributions labeled “QSE”, “SS” and “Anis” are due to quantum size eﬀect, the surface stress and the
anisotropy, respectively. In sections II A, II B and II C we introduce and discuss these contributions. We also remark
that this paper is a general theoretical study. It is not our goal to study any particular material system. Therefore
the parameter values that we use are realistic (feasible) at best.

A. QSE contribution to surface energy

Based on his analysis of the pioneer model of Zhang, Niu & Shih2 for “electronic” metal-on-semiconductor growth,

Hirayama3 suggested the following form of γ(QSE):

γ(QSE)(h) =

g0

h2 − g1

h

, g0, g1 > 0,

(10)

where the ﬁrst term is due to quantum conﬁnement of the electrons in a thin ﬁlm, and the second term is due to the
electrons spilling out to the ﬁlm/substrate interface (the charge spilling eﬀect).36 Eq. (10) has two drawbacks: (i) it

does not account for QSE oscillation; the latter is known to result in a damped oscillatory, in the thickness h, behavior
of a total QSE surface energy2, and (ii) it diverges as h → 0, making it unsuitable for use in a PDE-based model.
We account for the damped oscillatory behavior by multiplying γ(QSE) of Eq. (10) by the factor 1 + Ae−h/r sin ηh,
where A is the dimensionless amplitude, η the wave number, and r the characteristic oscillation decay distance2,4,7.
To prevent the surface energy from diverging as h → 0, we modify both fractions in Eq. (10) by adding a small
wetting length s to the denominators. This results in

(cid:18) g0s2
(h + s)2 − g1s

h + s

(cid:19)(cid:16)

γ(QSE)(h) =

(cid:17)

1 + Ae−h/r sin ηh

.

(11)

3

Here we follow Chiu8, who suggested the surface energy in the form γ(h) = g0sp/(h + s)p. He used this form (with
p = 1 for a quantum conﬁnement mechanism, which he did not deﬁne precisely) in the analysis of the islands coarsening
in a heteroepitaxial system.
Equation (11) is the ﬁnal dimensional form of the model γ(QSE)(h); g0, g1, r, s, A and η are the material
parameters. The wetting length s = 4˚A = 0.4nm ∼ 1.5 − 2 ML is cited by Chiu8. r will be taken in the interval 0.1
nm - 1 nm, which corresponds to the exponent e−h/r decaying to zero at h ∼ 1 nm (h ∼ 10 nm) when r = 0.1 nm
(r = 1 nm). Also, Figure 5 in Han & Liu7 suggests that η ∼ 2π/λF ∼ 8π nm−1 for Ag, Au, Mg, Al and Pb.

Next, we make γ(QSE)(h) dimensionless and illustrate it. We scale h by r and introduce a small parameter α = r/(cid:96),
where (cid:96) is the large lateral dimension of the ﬁlm (the same along the x and y axes). Augmented by the following scaling
of the in-plane coordinates: (x, y) = (cid:96)(X, Y ), this is termed a thin ﬁlm scaling and it will be applied consistently in
other parts of the paper. Thus h = rH = α(cid:96)H, where H is the dimensionless thickness. Then it follows that

(cid:18)

γ(QSE)(H) =

G0

(1 + ψH)2 − G1

1 + ψH

(cid:19)(cid:0)1 + Ae−H sin ρH(cid:1) , A > 0

(12)

is the dimensionless QSE energy, given that γ0 (the nominal surface energy, i.e. the value in the absence of QSE, the
surface stress and the anisotropy eﬀects) has been used as the energy scale. Here G0 = g0/γ0, G1 = g1/γ0, ψ = r/s
and ρ = rη. Notice that 0 < G0, G1 < 1 and there is no small parameters in Eq. (12), since ψ may typically take
values from [0.1,10] based on r and s, and ρ ∈ [1, 25] based on η.

In the important limiting case A = 0 the parameter r is irrelevant, thus instead we scale h by s, and then α = s/(cid:96)

and h = sH = α(cid:96)H. This gives another dimensionless expression for γ(QSE)(H):

γ(QSE)(H) =

G0

(1 + H)2 − G1

1 + H

, A = 0;

(13)

notice that the parameters ψ and ρ are not needed. Since only the deﬁnition of the small parameter α is aﬀected, the
change of the h-scale from r to s in A = 0 case does not aﬀect adimensionalization of γ(SS) and γ(Anis).

Figure 1 shows the graphs of 1+γ(QSE)(H), which is the nominal surface energy (the dimensionless value one) oﬀset
by γ(QSE)(H). One can notice that the increase of ψ shifts only the ﬁrst minimum toward smaller ﬁlm thickness.
This means that the wetting layer only aﬀects the stability of very thin ﬁlms. Notice also that as A increases, the
mean value of the surface energy and the overall shape of the energy curve become less dependent on ψ.

FIG. 1: Graphs of 1 + γ(QSE)(H); G0 = G1 = 0.1. (a): A = 0 (QSE oscillation is not present). (b): A = 0.5, ρ = 10. Solid
line: ψ = 1, dashed line: ψ = 10. (c): Same as (b), but A = 10.

From the viewpoint of the thermodynamic stability analysis a planar surface of a ﬁlm is stable,

γ(QSE)(H)) ≥ 0. For γ(QSE)(H) in Eq. (13) this yields the condition

G1 ≤ 3G0
1 + H0

⇐⇒ H0 ≤ 3G0/G1 − 1 = H0c.

if

∂2
∂H 2 (1 +

(14)

4

Thus a deposited ﬁlm with a planar surface is unstable, if its thickness H0 exceeds the critical value H0c; clearly, H0c
increases linearly with the ratio G0/G1. Notice that all ﬁlms are unstable if G0 ≤ G1/3, since in this case H0c ≤ 0.
For the parameters values in Figure 1(a) H0c = 2, and at this thickness the curvature of the energy curve switches
from a positive value to a negative one (the inﬂection point). Also, Hirayama3 points out that the minimum of the
energy curve has to occur at H > 0. This results in the following restriction on G0 and G1: G1 < 2G0.

When A > 0 (QSE oscillation) the thermodynamic criterion of stability (Eq. (12)) can be solved numerically. A

better and more versatile method is a full linear stability analysis, which we perform in section IV A.

B. Surface stress contribution to surface energy

We assume that the lattice mismatch between the ﬁlm and the substrate (and more generally, the interaction energy
of a ﬁlm and substrate atoms) has a negligible eﬀect on the stress at the surface; in other words, a thin metal ﬁlm
on a substrate is considered free-standing for the purpose of calculating the stress at the surface. The only source of
stress is thus the intrinsic surface stress.37 (It is well-known that the epitaxial relation between the metal ﬁlm and
a substrate is often unclear5, and in some systems (Ag/Fe(100)) the lattice mismatch is nearly absent6. Hirayama3
points out that even when the misﬁt strain is large the electronic growth theory, in which the mismatch strain is
not considered, is consistent with experiment. He points out the possibility that the ﬁlm-substrate bonding is weak,
which allows the ﬁlm to relax fully without introducing dislocations.)

In the 2009 paper, Hamilton & Wolfer14 re-visited the Gurtin-Murdoch model of surface elasticity21 and derived the
analytical relationship between the strain and the thickness of a free-standing metal nano-sheets. This relationship
makes possible the derivation of a surface stress energy. The starting point is the following expression from Sec. 5 of
Ref.14, which holds in the case of equi-biaxial strain:

γ(SS) = (Γ11 + Γ12) (2∗ + ) .

(15)

Here Γ11, Γ12 are the surface elastic moduli (with the units erg/atom),  the strain (dimensionless) and ∗ the
characteristic strain parameter, also dimensionless. Equation (15) is thus the surface energy per atom. Substitution
in Eq. (15) of  from Eq. (4), followed by the conversion to the energy per unit area gives
−42∗ (Γ11 + Γ12)2 [Γ11 + Γ12 + (h/(cid:96)0 − 2) (M11 + M12)] P

,

(16)

γ(SS)(h) =

[2Γ11 + 2Γ12 + (h/(cid:96)0 − 2) (M11 + M12)]2 (cid:96)2

where M11, M12 are the bulk elastic moduli, (cid:96)0 a monolayer height and P the total number of atoms in the ﬁlm.
Introducing thin ﬁlm scaling replaces h/(cid:96)0 by αH/((cid:96)0/(cid:96)). Since (cid:96)0/(cid:96) ∼ α, the small parameter α cancels from Eq.
(16). Using γ0 again for the energy unit, the dimensionless form reads:

γ(SS)(H) =

−F Γ [Γ + M (H − 2)]
[2Γ + M (H − 2)]2

,

(17)

where Γ = Γ11 + Γ12, M = M11 + M12 and F = 4csΓP 2∗/(γ0(cid:96)2). (Notice that F is dimensionless, and because Γ and
M have a unit of energy per atom, this unit cancels from Eq. (17).) cs = ±1 has been introduced into F to account
for tensile (cs = 1) or compressive (cs = −1) stress. Figure 2 shows that according to the thermodynamic stability
criterion, thick ﬁlms (H > 3 for the chosen set of parameters) subjected to a compressive (tensile) surface stress are
stable (unstable), while such ﬁlms subjected to a tensile (compressive) surface stress are unstable (stable).

C. Anisotropy contribution to surface energy

To introduce anisotropy we follow the established approach23. In the Cartesian coordinate system (x(cid:48), y(cid:48), z(cid:48)) aligned
with the crystal axes (the crystalline system) the cubic-symmetric surface energy of a surface element with a normal
direction n(cid:48) = (n(cid:48)

rotation,

in Ref.24, this curvature-squared “regularization” (ﬁrst noted by C. Herring25 and proposed by Gurtin et al.26 in the
context of a PDE-based model of a surface morphological evolution) can be traced to the interaction of steps in a
surface region where two facets meet at a corner.

III. EVOLUTION EQUATION FOR THE FILM THICKNESS

To derive the evolution PDE for the ﬁlm thickness, we ﬁrst substitute Eqs. (12), (17) and (21) into Eq. (9). Then the
resultant total dimensionless surface energy γ is substituted into the system (1) - (8). We complete adimensionalization

where B = Ω2νγ0/(cid:96)2kT , the overbar denotes the dimensionless quantities, and the ellipsis stands for H,
its

s ¯µκ, ¯∇2

s ¯µhot in the powers of α, retaining only the dominant order
coeﬃcients of all expansions. This ﬁnally yields a cumbersome highly nonlinear PDE. Since the goal of this paper is
the linear stability analysis, below we display only those contributions that are proportional to a single spatial partial
derivative of H(X, Y, T ).

this is another γ(Anis) contribution (the regularization), which originates in ¯∇2
s ¯µhot. We also introduced the coeﬃcient
functions q11(H; . . .) ≡ −γ(SS)(H; . . .), q12(H; . . .), q21(H; . . .) ≡ γ(QSE)(H; . . .), q31(H; . . .) in order to simplify the
appearance of equations in the next section; here the ellipsis denotes the dimensionless parameters.

Equations (24)-(29) hold when A = 0, given that ψ = 1 is substituted (cf. Eqs. (12) and (13)).

IV. LINEAR STABILITY ANALYSIS

7

In the vein of a standard linear stability analysis, the planar surface H = H0 of the as-deposited ﬁlm is perturbed
by a small perturbation ξ(X, Y, T ), i.e. H(X, Y, T ) = H0 + ξ(X, Y, T ). Substitution of this form into Eq. (24) and
linearization in ξ yields the coeﬃcient functions qij(H0; . . .), allowing to study the eﬀects of a ﬁlm thickness on ﬁlm
stability. Also, the derivatives of H are replaced by the corresponding derivatives of ξ. Then ξ is taken in the form of
a wave-like perturbation ξ = b eωT ei(k1X+k2Y ), where k1 and k2 are wave numbers along the X and Y directions, ω
the growth (or decay) rate, and b (cid:28) 1. This ﬁnally results in the following expression for ω (the dispersion relation):

ω (k1, k2) = (q11 − q21 − a00γ − 1)(cid:0)k4

Here we omitted the arguments of qij’s.

Next, we proceed to analyze three important situations: QSE only; QSE and the anisotropy; QSE, the anisotropy

and the surface stress.

A. QSE

When only QSE is operative, the dispersion relation (30) takes the form:

ω (k1, k2) = − (q21 + 1)(cid:0)k4

(cid:1) − q31

(cid:0)k2

Notice that the Mullins’ contribution −(cid:0)k4

curved. One can now see that the surface is stable, if q21 + 1, q31 ≥ 0, and it is unstable with respect to growth of a
long-wave perturbations, i.e. those with wave numbers k1 < k1c, k2 < k2c, if q31 < 0 and q21 + 1 > 0. The latter two
conditions ensure that small (large) wave numbers grow (decay), thus the cut-oﬀ values k1c and k2c exist. A typical
growth rate at a ﬁxed unstable thickness is plotted in Figure 3. It can be noticed by comparing the panels (a) and
(b) of this Figure that QSE oscillation makes the ﬁlm more unstable, since the interval of unstable wave numbers is
wider when A > 0.

FIG. 3: (Color online.) Contour plots of the perturbation growth rate ω (k1, k2) for QSE case, Eq. (31), where G0 = G1 =
0.1, H0 = 5. (a) A = 0; (b) A = 10, ρ = 10, ψ = 1.

From the stability conditions q21 + 1, q31 ≥ 0 we obtain, at A = 0:

(33)

The second of these conditions is (14) in Sec. II A, which was obtained from the thermodynamic argument. Notice
that since 0 < G0, G1 < 1, the ﬁrst condition holds for any H0. The ﬁlm is unstable when (33) does not hold.

8

If instead of the described two-dimensional (2D) problem setting one chooses a simpler one-dimensional (1D)
setting, then k2 = 0 in Eq. (31) and the growth rate ωmax and the wave number k1max ≡ kmax of the fastest growing
perturbation can be easily determined analytically from this equation. kmax also can be detected in experiment, since
this mode will dominate shortly after the evolution starts. In 2D setting k1max, k2max and ωmax may be computed.
However, due to a symmetry of Eq. (31) with respect to k1 and k2 in the isotropic case, the variations of k1max,
k2max, and the maximum growth rate with respect to the parameters are the same as the corresponding variations
of “1D” kmax and ωmax. (From here on, and to the paper’s end, kmax will mean “1D” kmax.) Also in this case
k1max = k2max = kmax. All just said is true in some anisotropic situations, such as for example the [111] and [001]
surface orientations; here, since a02 = a20 (see the Table 1) the symmetry is unbroken. Thus with a goal of better
understanding key dependencies on the parameters, where possible we will use a simpler 1D setting and calculate and
then plot kmax or ω(k1, 0) (see Figures 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 and 11). In reference to these Figures, the “wave length” of the

fastest growing 2D perturbation λmax = 2π/(cid:112)k2

2/kmax.

(34)

For A = 0 case, Figure 4 shows kmax vs. H0 for various ratios G1/G0. These results are insensitive to ρ values.
The ﬁlm is stable at H0 < 11 for G1 = 0.025, at H0 < 2 for G1 = 0.1, and at H0 < 1 for G1 = 0.15 (since kmax
vanishes); this means that the decrease of the component of γ(QSE) that is due to charge spilling results in thicker
stable ﬁlms. This is also evident from the stability condition (14) (or (33)).38 For all admissible G1 values (such that
0 < G1 < 2G0) the ﬁlm is unstable at large H0 (notice that kmax is ﬁnite and small).

FIG. 4: Long-wave instability for QSE case; A = 0, G0 = 0.1. Curves show kmax vs. H0 for G1 = 0.025, 0.1, 0.15 (solid,
dashed, and dotted lines, respectively).

When A > 0 (QSE oscillation), the analytical conditions similar to (33) and (32) are impossible to derive. Notice
that stability in this situation depends not only on the products ψH0 and ρH0, but also on H0, ψ and ρ separately, see
Eq. (27). Thus in Figure 5 we ﬁrst show kmax vs. ψ and ρ for ﬁxed H0. In the panel (a) kmax is positive (long-wave
instability), it peaks at ψ = 1, then slowly and monotonically decreases; thus the ﬁlm becomes more stable, since the
interval of unstable modes shrinks. The weak eﬀect of ψ on kmax means that the wetting layer has a very minor role
in the instability in comparison to QSE, as we had already remarked in the discussion of Figure 1 and in the ﬁrst
paragraph of Sec. II B. In the panel (b) the dependence on ρ is more non-trivial. For H0 = 10, when ρ is small there
is instability which starts to alternate with stability (kmax = 0) when ρ is suﬃciently large, and the amplitude of this
oscillation increases. The ﬁrst ρ value at which the ﬁlm becomes stable is marked ρc on the ρ-axis. Increasing H0
to twenty makes the ﬁlm unstable in the entire ρ interval in the Figure. There is still the oscillation (inset), albeit
with a much smaller amplitude. In the panel (c) the number of the “critical” QSE oscillation wavelengths (where the
critical wavelength is 2π/ρc) that “ﬁt” into a given stable ﬁlm thickness H0 is plotted vs. this thickness. (Notice that
in this panel the stability of the chosen thicknesses is imposed, in contrast to the panels (d)-(g), where it is obtained
when the parameter(s) are varied.) Thus in order to stabilize larger thicknesses at all parameters ﬁxed (except ρ)
the number of QSE oscillation wavelengths must increase exponentially. In the panels (d)-(g) of Figure 5 the contour
plots of the function kmax(A, H0) (with ρ and ψ ﬁxed) are shown. As the ﬁlm thickness increases, the alternating
stable and unstable bands repeat with the periodicity of γ(QSE)(H), 2π/ρ = 2π/10 = 0.628. The positions along the
H0-axis of the stable (unstable) bands closely match the H-coordinates of the minima (maxima) of the γ(QSE)(H)
curve, see Figure 1(c) (which is plotted also at ρ = 10).
In other words, the stable (unstable) ﬁlm thicknesses
correspond to the minimas (maximas) of the energy curve. Within each unstable band the wavelength of the most

unstable perturbation decreases (larger kmax) as A increases. Also, larger unstable thicknesses are destabilized by
longer wavelengths. Finally, the panel (g) mirrors the panel (b): with the increase of the ﬁlm thickness the instability
starts to prevail, and at H0 > 14 the alternating stability/instability is eliminated completely. The instability with a
small and roughly constant value of kmax sets in at H0 > 14 for 0 < A ≤ 100. The threshold value H0 = 14 coincides
with the one at which the damped oscillation of γ(QSE)(H; A = 100) becomes eﬀectively extinct.

FIG. 5: (Color online.) Long-wave instability for QSE case; G0 = G1 = 0.1. The curve in the panel (a) corresponds to
A = ρ = 10 and H0 > 11. In the panels (b) and (c) A = 10, ψ = 2. In the panel (b) H0 = 10 (diamonds) and 20 (circles);
inset shows H0 = 20 curve separately. In the panel (c) the curve is the exponential ﬁt to the data shown by diamonds. Panels
(d)-(g) show the contour plots of kmax at the increasing H0 values (four panels are necessary to ensure good resolution of the
plot); the ﬁlm is stable in the white regions, i.e. ω ≤ 0 for all non-negative wave numbers. Here ρ = 10, ψ = 2. The red cross
in the panel (b) correlates with the black dot at (A, H0) = (10, 10) in the panel (f).

To wrap up the discussions in this section, we remark that the alternation of stable and unstable ﬁlm thicknesses, or a
more complicated beating patterns, have been predicted by the “electronic growth” theory and seen in experiment1–4,6.
We also remark that the surface deformation that emerges from the long-wave instability is bi-continuous, H ∼
eωmaxt cos k1maxX1 cos k2maxX2, since k1max and k2max are non-zero (and the same value, as we discussed above); see
Figure 3.

Some level of the surface energy anisotropy is always present in a crystal ﬁlm system. Pinholes that form in the
ultra-thin Ag ﬁlms5 and in thicker (80 nm) Ni ﬁlms32 appear faceted and, though uncommon, metal islands also may

B. QSE and anisotropy

10

grow into highly faceted shapes33,34. In this section we analyze how the combination of QSE and anisotropy aﬀects
the ﬁlm stability. When the anisotropy is accounted for, the contributions f4 and f5 are present at the right-hand
side of Eq. (24), unless the anisotropy is mild, i.e. the anisotropy strength parameter −1/(a00 + a20 + a02) < γ < 0.
In the latter case the regularization parameter ∆ = 0 and the f5-term vanishes. When the anisotropy is strong,
γ ≤ −1/(a00 + a20 + a02) ≡ γc, a faceting instability is expected to emerge; here γc is the critical value. A faceting
instability was theoretically studied in several papers for diﬀerent situations, which include ﬁlm growth, substrate
wetting, and heteroepitaxial stress, see for instance Refs.9–13,16,17,24,27–30.
We only consider QSE oscillation case, A (cid:54)= 0, and vary only γ and H0. Value of the latter parameter depends
on the amount of a ﬁlm material deposited on a substrate, and the former parameter depends on the temperature
and the material itself. In addition, we will compare [111] and [011] surface orientations; for the latter orientation
the coeﬃcients a20 and a02 diﬀer in the sign and magnitude (a broken symmetry), see the Table 1. This makes the
stability character quite diﬀerent from [111] case.

For [111] surface k1max = k2max = kmax due to the symmetry of the anisotropy coeﬃcients, and in Figure 6(a) we
|γ| becomes
plot kmax vs. H0 for γ and other parameters ﬁxed. One can see how increasing the anisotropy (i.e.
larger) promotes instability by eliminating H0 values where the surface would be stable (kmax = 0) if there was no
anisotropy or if the anisotropy was weak. To complement Figure 6(a), in the panel (b) of this Figure kmax is plotted
vs. γ for ﬁxed H0 and other parameters. It can be seen that increasing |γ| ﬁrst has little eﬀect, then kmax starts
to increase and thus the instability wavelength decreases. Notice that though the transition from weak to strong
anisotropy is at γc = −1/3, this event is not reﬂected in the graph due to imposed regularization (the curve is
smooth; a small kink is at the sub-critical value γ ≈ −0.25).

FIG. 6: (Color online.) Long-wave instability for QSE+anisotropy case and [111] surface orientation. A = ρ = 10, ψ = 2, G0 =
G1 = 0.1, and ∆ = 83 for γ ≤ γc = −1/3, and is zero otherwise. In the panel (b) H0 = 10.

For [011] surface, the panels (a) and (b) of Figure 7 show how k1 values are steadily eliminated from the spectrum
of unstable wave numbers with the increase of H0. More detailed check of the growth rate conﬁrms that k1max = 0
always. Thus the surface deformation is in the form H ∼ eωmaxt cos k2maxX2, which describes long rolls with their axes
(spaced 2π/k2max units apart) directed along X1-axis. The panel (c) of this ﬁgure is similar to Figure 6(a); comparing
to the latter ﬁgure, one notices that in [011] case a smaller supercritical anisotropy is suﬃcient for instability in the
entire interval of H0. Also, a wave number values are more than two times larger, suggesting perturbations with
shorter wavelengths.

C. QSE, anisotropy, and surface stress

In this section we brieﬂy discuss the ﬁlm stability in the presence of all three major physical eﬀects: QSE, the
anisotropy and the surface stress. The number of the dimensionless parameters is large in this case, thus we only aim
at revealing some most prominent features of surface instability. The discussion of [111] surface suﬃce in this regard.
We use 1D approach since the anisotropy of [111] surface does not break the symmetry even in the presence of the

surface stress. The contour plots of ω (k1, 0) are shown in Figures 8, 9 and 11.

11

FIG. 7: (Color online.) (a,b): Contour plots of the perturbation growth rate ω (k1, k2) for QSE+anisotropy case and [011]
surface orientation, where A = ρ = 10, ψ = 2, G0 = G1 = 0.1 and γ = −1 < γc = −2/3 (strong anisotropy). (a) H0 = 5; (b)
H0 = 14. (c): The wave number k2max at which ω attains a maximum vs. H0.

Comparing Figures 8 and 9 we notice ﬁrst that at the small value of the stress parameter ∗ the anisotropy dominates
irrespective of whether the stress is compressive or tensile (Figure 8(a,c) and Figure 9(a,c)). Instability alternates with
stability at small ﬁlm thicknesses, and at the weak (strong) anisotropy the large thicknesses are stable (unstable).
Increasing the compressive stress at either a weak or strong anisotropy (Figures 8(b,d)) has the eﬀect of equally
stabilizing the large thicknesses, thus large compressive stress prevails over the anisotropy and QSE. The instability
in Figure 8 has a long-wave character.

Quite interestingly, at the small ﬁlm thicknesses and either a weak or strong anisotropy increasing the tensile stress
changes the character of the instability from the long-wave (Figures 9(a,c)) to the short-wave (Figures 9(b,d)). The
typical plot of the growth rate at a ﬁxed thickness (H0 < 3) is shown in Figure 10; notice that ω (k1, 0) < 0 at the
large and small wave numbers. The short-wave instability may change the nonlinear evolution of the ﬁlm during
dewetting from coarsening to the formation of spatially regular patterns9. In Figure 11 it can be seen that at H0 = 2
the short-wave instability manifests at A <∼ 13, but with the increase of H0 to four it only appears at A > 30; at
H0 > 4 there is no A values that ensure the short-wave instability. Also one can notice by comparing Figures 9(b,d)
that strong anisotropy slightly widens the domain of unstable wavenumbers.

We studied the linear stability of a surface of a supported ultra-thin metal ﬁlm using a PDE-based model that
incorporates quantum size eﬀect, the surface energy anisotropy, and the surface stress. By a systematic comparison,

V. CONCLUSIONS

12

FIG. 8: (Color online.) Contour plots of ω (k1, 0) for QSE+anisotropy+surface stress case, where surface orientation is [111],
stress is compressive (cs = −1), A = ρ = 10, ψ = 2, G0 = G1 = 0.1, and other parameters as in the caption to Figure 2 (except
ΓP = 9.6 × 10−6 erg). (a) ∗ = 10−5, γ = −0.1. (b) ∗ = 10−3, γ = −0.1. Parameters in (c), (d) are the same as in (a), (b),
respectively, except γ = −1 (strong anisotropy). In the white areas the ﬁlm is stable.

a contribution of each eﬀect into the overall stability (or instability) can be discerned. The following major trends
are revealed (some for the ﬁrst time):

1. For QSE alone, without QSE oscillation (A = 0; here A is the amplitude of QSE oscillation): a ﬁlm is unstable
when its dimensionless thickness H0 > 3G0/G1 − 1 = H0c. Here G0, G1 are the parameters that deﬁne
the “intensity” of the electrons quantum conﬁnement in the ﬁlm and the charge spilling at the ﬁlm/substrate
interface, respectively. This is the usual “thermodynamic” condition for instability. Weakening of the charge
spilling by reducing G1 results in thicker stable ﬁlms.

2. For QSE alone, with QSE oscillation (A > 0): For all nonzero A values, as H0 increases from zero there
emerge the alternating stable and unstable ﬁlm thicknesses that follow the locations of, respectively, minimas
and maximas of the γ(QSE)(H) curve. On the other hand, if H0 is one of the unstable thicknesses, then
increasing A results in shorter unstable wavelengths. Larger unstable thicknesses are destabilized by longer
wavelengths. At ﬁxed A, the alternation of stable and unstable thicknesses ceases when H0 is above a threshold
value that coincides with the one at which the damped oscillations of γ(QSE)(H) become eﬀectively extinct,
and all thicknesses above the threshold are unstable with respect to long-wavelength perturbations. If a ﬁlm is
unstable at some H0, then the most dangerous wavelength is very weakly sensitive to the changes of a wetting
layer parameter, signaling that a wetting layer does not have a signiﬁcant role in the instability. Finally, if a
ﬁlm is unstable at some H0 with or without QSE oscillation, then the spectrum of unstable wave numbers and
the perturbation growth rate are larger in the former case.

13

FIG. 9: (Color online.) Same as Figure 8, except that the surface stress is tensile (cs = 1). Notice that the panels (a), (c)
coincide with (a) and (c) in Figure 8. In the white areas the ﬁlm is stable.

FIG. 10: Cross-section of the contour plot in Figure 9(b) by the line H0 = 2.

3. For QSE (with QSE oscillation) and anisotropy: As the oscillation imposes the alternation of stable and unstable
thickness bands, increasing the anisotropy contributes to instability by eliminating stable bands. Also, if at given
H0 a ﬁlm is unstable without the anisotropy and QSE oscillation, then “turning on” the anisotropy makes the
most dangerous wavelength smaller. [011] surface is more unstable than [111] surface. The deformation of [011]
surface has the form of parallel rolls (1D mode), while the deformation of [111] surface is bicontinuous (2D
mode).

4. For QSE with QSE oscillation, the anisotropy, and the surface stress: We found diﬀerent instability characters

14

FIG. 11: (Color online.) Panels (a) and (b) are the same as Figure 9(b), except here A varies and H0 = 2 in (a), H0 = 4 in (b).

depending on whether the stress is compressive (the long-wave instability) or tensile (the short-wave (long-
wave) instability at the small (large) thickness). Increasing the compressive stress eliminates stable (unstable)
ﬁlm thicknesses at smaller (larger) H0, i.e. thick (thin) ﬁlms are stabilized (destabilized) by the compressive
stress. The tensile stress has a somewhat opposite eﬀect: it stabilizes very thin ﬁlms (eliminates unstable ﬁlm
thicknesses at small H0), and destabilizes thicker ﬁlms. As the result, the short-wave instability emerges at small
H0. This instability is robust with respect to QSE and anisotropy, i.e. it persists when A and the anisotropy
strength are varied in a wide intervals.

We hope that these results can be used to better understand the dewetting mechanisms of an ultra-thin metal ﬁlms.

35 Herring-Mullins theory has been used to study the instabilities and morphological evolution of a comparatively thick ﬁlms
(> 100 nm). However, the theory does not have a limitation on a thickness per se. The base assumption in the theory is that
there is a mobile adsorbate on the crystal surface, i.e. the top layer of the crystal is “ﬂuid”, and the geometrical quantities
such as the curvature can be deﬁned for the surface. The top layer is usually considered to be one to three atoms deep.
Thus the theory is applicable to thinner ﬁlms. It must be noted here that the dewetting of the ultra-thin metallic ﬁlms is
apparently driven by surface diﬀusion, as the ﬁlms develop a faceted pinholes that extend from the surface down to the
substrate, and the pinholes are surrounded at their surface perimeter by the characteristic high rims formed out of the ﬁlm
material that diﬀused from the pinhole bottom5.

36 Eq. (10) is mostly phenomenological and is obtained in Ref.3 by ﬁtting the electronic potential curve in Zhang et al.2 True
values of the exponents of h may somewhat diﬀer from the integer values seen in Eq. (10), which may result in a minor
quantitative corrections of our stability results. The form of Eq. (10) is also expected to hold for many metal-on-metal
systems (some examples are Pb/Cu, Ag/Fe, Ag/NiAl, and Fe/CuAu), as in these systems the same conﬁnement and spilling
eﬀects are also present; see the review6.

37 It was argued recently31 that in addition to this conventional surface stress of a macroscopic thin ﬁlm, the ultra-thin metal
ﬁlms also are inﬂuenced by quantum oscillations in the surface stress that are phase shifted with respect to the oscillations
of the surface energy (the latter oscillations are termed QSE oscillations in this paper). The authors of Ref.31 propose that
the coupling of the two oscillations may be responsible for the extension of the surface energy oscillations to thick ﬁlms
(> 30 ML).

38 In section 5 of his paper, Hirayama3 cites the experiments where the shift of the critical thickness is arguably achieved
through enhancement of charge spillage at the interface after the layer of Al is inserted between Ag ﬁlm and Si substrate.
