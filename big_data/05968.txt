The investigation of any violation in the Cosmic Distance Duality Relation (CDDR) is one of the
most important sources of investigation for a new physic. In this paper we propose a new method
to ﬁnd the origin of a possible violation on the CDDR. Such violation is deﬁned from the equation
dA(1+z)2 = η, with η 6= 1. We analyze the observational constraints from SNIa, BAO and fgas
for the parameter η using three diﬀerent parameterizations. We create three data sets with the
following combinations: (Set I) dL data from SNIa and dA data from BAO measurements, (Set II)
dL data from fgas and dA from BAO measurements and (Set III) dL from SNIa and dA from fgas
measurements. The sets have 18 points and a redshift diﬀerence between the observational pairs of
∆z ≤ 0.08. It is found that the diﬀerence between Sets I and II is up to ﬁve times higher than Sets
I and III, what suggest that a violation in the CDDR come from a new physics related with the
angular diameter distance.

INTRODUCTION

Nowadays the observational data present the possi-
bility of testing observationally fundamental hypothesis
that support theoretical cosmological models. One of the
possibility of studied in this sense is the analysis of the
Cosmic Distance Duality Relation (CDDR) [1].

The CDDR is based on the so-called distance reci-
procity law, proved long time ago by Etherington [2].
It states that a source and an observer, in relative mo-
tion, have a relation between the solid angles subtended
between them involving the source redshift z measured
by the observer.

For all cosmological models that assume the met-
ric is Riemannian, the photons follow null and unique
geodesics and also that the number of photons is con-
served, we can derive the CDDR from the reciprocity
law, in such a way that the CDDR can be writen as [3]

dL

dA(1 + z)2 = 1,

(1)

where dL and dA represents the luminosity distance
and the angular diameter distance, respectively, between
source and observer. Thus, if the assumptions assumed
for the above relation between these two distances are
not valid, then it is not equal to 1 but instead equal to a
general parameter (η(z)) that describes the violation of
the CDDR.

Therefore, if the observational data indicate that the
above relation is not valid then it indicates an evidence of
a new physics. Some mechanisms that could be sources of
violation of CDDR are: interactive cosmological creation

process [4], photon-axion oscillation in an external mag-
netic ﬁeld [5], possible variation of fundamental constants
[6], among others (see, e.g., [7] and references therein).

Recently, there is a great eﬀort to explore the validity
of the CDDR through many approaches: In refs. [9] di-
rect measurements of dA (for instance, observations from
galaxy clusters, FRIIb radio galaxies, ultra-compact ra-
dio sources, among others) are combined with measure-
ments of dL (e.g.
from Supernova type Ia) in order to
obtain observational constraints on the relation between
these two distances measurements and so if the Eq. (1)
holds its validity; analyzing the CMB temperature evo-
lution, the authors from Refs. [10] tested a possible vari-
ation of the stantard redshift-temperature relation of the
universe and so a violation on the CDDR; another ap-
proach was taken in Ref. [11], where only galaxy clusters
data were used and the observational test is based on
the fact that the gas mass fraction obtained from SZE
and X-ray, for the same galaxy cluster, have diﬀerent
dependences on the CDDR; other cosmological model-
independent tests have been proposed by using SNe Ia
observations with opacity-free distance modulus obtained
from Hubble parameter data [12]; among others [13].

Even though the current observational data do not
have accuracy enough to give a ﬁnal answer about the
validation of the CDDR, computational simulations in-
dicate that a slight violation is still possible, even with
future and better surveys [14].

In this paper we present a new test to ﬁnd the nature of
a possible violation on the CDDR. In this test, diﬀerent
observational data sets are built, in order to have data
sets that vary only in dA data and only in dL. Therefore,
any diﬀerence in the diﬀerent sets will indicate if the
CDDR violation comes from the luminosity distance or
the angular diameter distance, then if the new physics
would be related with some mechanism associated with
one or other distance measurement.

The ﬁducial model assumed throughout this paper is

II. DISTANCES MEASUREMENTS

A.

dL from SNIa

The observations of distant supernovae type Ia (SNIa)
furnish the diﬀerence between the apparent and abso-
lut magnitudes, called distance moduli (µ) ([16, 17, 18]).
This measurement can be related with the luminosity
distance trough the relation

The data set used in this paper, for the measurements
envolving SNe Ia, is the Union 2.1 compilation [18] which
contains 580 points distributed in a wide redshift range
(0.01 < z < 1.41).
In order to combine the SNe Ia
measurements with the others two observational data,
we carefully chosen a subsample of SNIa with 18 points
where each point has a redshift that more coincides with
the points from the others two data sets.

B.

dA from BAO

The most common approach in the literature for the
baryon acoustic oscilations (BAO) observations provides
the acoustic peak in the galaxy correlation function which
is related with the ratio between the comoving sound
horizon at the baryon drag epoch (rs(zd)) and an eﬀective
volume distance (DV ) ([19, 20, 21, 24, 26]), where

Another approach for the BAO obsertions is given by
[27], where the BAO signal comes from the angular sep-
aration (Θ) between pairs of galaxies, so

.

(7)

In this paper we assume the value for rs as the obtained
by the Planck collaboration ([15]). The complete obser-
vational sample used in this paper is composed by 18
points, obtained from the combination of diﬀerent data
sets ([20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27]). The sample built
has a redshift range varying between 0.106 < z < 0.730.

C.

dL and dA from fgas

The gas mass fraction (fgas) is a cosmological test
widely used to constraint cosmological parameters ([28,
31, 32, 34]). The fgas measurement is originally a com-
bination of dA and dL (as discussed in [33]) and given
by

where ∗ means the ﬁducial model assumed and N quan-

3

When the CDDR is valid, we obtain the well known

expression relating fgas and dA [34] where

fgas ∝ dA

3/2.

(9)

Although the above equation, in this paper we explore
the fgas as a test for both dA and dL. Also, we do not
assume in principle that CDDR is valid for the distance
measured. On the other hand, concerning to the ﬁdu-
cial model assumed in this paper, the CDDR is valid (so
A(1 + z)2 = 1). Thus, using Eq. (1), the measure-

SN Ia and
ηfgas
SN Ia), or if the discrepancy is higher between the Sets
I and III, where the variation is just in the dL measure-
ments (ηBAO

SN Ia and ηBAO
fgas

).

For the sake of completeness we must to clarify that
here we are assuming that any variations from the sets
come from the sensitivity of the CDDR for diﬀerent types
of distances. Thus, we are assuming that the discrepancy
between the sets do not come from systematics within.
We understand that even if it is the case, the method
is still useful for future tests with diﬀerent observational
tests that have strong bounds on their systematic errors.

The observational data sample for fgas is obtained
from [30] and comprises a sample with a total of 42 points
in a redshift range varying between 0.063 < z < 1.063.
The clusters studied are all regular, hot and relatively
relaxed systems. The subsample of 18 points is obtained
taking the points with the most coincident redshift com-
pared with the others two observational data (SNIa and
BAO).

III. METHOD

In order to ﬁnd the physical origin of any CDDR vi-
olation, we analyze diﬀerent sets of η data (from Eq.
(1)), ﬁrst varying the measurements only in dA and after
varying only in dL. The method to obtain this analy-
sis is as follows: ﬁrst we create a set of η obtained from
the combinations of dL measurements from SNIa and dA
measurements from BAO (Set I), deﬁned as

η =

dSN Ia
L
dBAO
(1 + z)2
A

≡ ηSN Ia
BAO .

(12)

After, we create another set combining dL measurements
from SNIa and dA measurements from fgas (Set II)

η =

dSN Ia
L
dfgas
A (1 + z)2

≡ ηSN Ia

.

(13)

Following the method presented in the previous sec-
tion, we assume the observational data mentioned in Sec-
tion 2 and we obtain the observational values of η for the
diﬀerent sets (Eqs. (11), (12) and (13)). The values ob-
tained for ηSN Ia
BAO are shown in Table I,
where the redshift means are calculated from the mean
between the redshift of both observational tests envolved
in each set.

BAO , ηSN Ia

and ηfgas

Next we perform a Bayesian χ2-test, in order to ob-
tain the Likelihood curves associated with each set and
analyze the discrepance between them. The statistical
expression for the χ2-test is given by

(ηth(z) − ηobs(z))2

The normalized likelihood is deﬁned as L = L0e−

where L0 = e−

In order to calculate the χ2-test, we must assume
a parametrization to obtain the theoretical values for
ηth(z). In this paper we use three parametrizations:

P 1 : ηth(z) = 1 + η0z,

P 2 : ηth(z) = 1 + η0(cid:18) z

1 + z(cid:19) ,

P 3 : ηth(z) =

(1 + η0z)2 .

(16)

from BAO where

η =

The parameter η0 quantiﬁes the violation on the cos-

For instance, the ﬁrst one is the most natural approach,
simply by assuming a polynomial equation, but it is not
valid at the limit z → ∞; the second one is an improve-
ment of the previous one, where is valid even in high-z;

We plot in Fig. 1 the likelihood distribution as a func-
tion of η0, for each parametrization. The best ﬁt values
obtained are shown in Table II.

The ﬁnal result of our analysis is the comparasion, in
each parametrization, between the diﬀerent curves ob-
tained from diﬀerent sets. Thus, the diﬀerence between
diﬀerent combinations of the observational data for the
pairs dL and dA. In order to quantify this discrepance
between the curves we adopt the Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test for two sets ([35]) and calculate the diﬀerence be-
tween the cumulative distribution for the combination of
sets I and II (DI,II ), and for the combination of sets I
and III (DI,III ), in each parametrization. The values for
the diﬀerence between the cumulative distributions are

given in table III. The ratio DI,II/DI,III vary from 2.5
to 5.5 indicating that the variation on the angular diame-
ter distance has a greater impact on the likelihood curves
than the variation on the luminosity distance.

Our

results

of

independently

show that
sistematically the Sets

the
parametrization,
I and II
are more diﬀerent between each other than the Sets I
and III. So, our results show that when we vary only
the measurements related with the angular diameter
distance there is an appreciated change on the CDDR
measurement. In other words, when we vary the mea-
surements only on the angular diameter distance, i.e. Set
I and II (ηSN Ia
), the correspondent variation
BAO
in the likelihood curves are greater than when we vary
the measurements only on the luminosity distance,
i.e. Set I and III (ηSN Ia
BAO). Thus, there is an
BAO
indication that the origin of any CDDR violation come
from some new physics related with angular diameter
distance measurements, for instance a violation on the
Riemannian geometry assumption.

V. CONCLUSIONS

The observational analysis of the Cosmic Duality Dis-
tance Relation can arise a question mark on the common
assumptions we assume. In this sense, many works in the
literature bring the possibility of a new physiscs, for in-
stance, a photon-axion coupling, a modiﬁcation in the
standard redshift-temperature relation in the universe
among others, and all of this possibilities would lead to
a change on the CDDR.

In this paper, we have proposed a new test to ﬁnd the
origin of a possible violation on the CDDR. Any violation
on the CDDR, and therefore by a change in the relation
between measurements of dA and dL, can be character-
ized by a parameter η (Eq. (2)) diﬀerent from 1. The test
presented consist in create diﬀerent sets of η measure-
ments with diﬀerent combinations of cosmological tests
(in this paper SNIa, BAO and fgas) and analyze which
are the sets with higher diﬀerence. Due to the nature
of the gas mass fraction test, it is possible to build sets
where just the dA measurements are changed and others
where the change is just in the dL measurements. There-
fore we can analyze if the η parameter change more when
the dA or the dL are modiﬁed.

5

In order to perfom our test, we have created three
sets of η values. The ﬁrst one is a combination of
dL from SNIa and dA from BAO measurements (Set
I), the second is a combination of dL from fgas and
dA from BAO measurements (Set II) and ﬁnnaly the
third set is a combination of dL from SNIa and dA
from fgasmeasurements (Set III). The observational data
of SNIa used is obtained from the Union 2.1 compila-
tion ([18]), the BAO data come from diﬀerent surveys
([20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27]) and the gas mass frac-
tion measurements used are obtained from ([30]). The
pairs of points are carefully chosen to limit the redshift
diﬀerence until ∆z < 0.08.

1+z(cid:17) and (P3) ηth(z) =

We use three diﬀerent parameterizations for the func-
tional forms of η: (P1) ηth(z) = 1 + η0z, (P2) ηth(z) =
(1+η0z)2 . In each of them
there is no violation on the CDDR when η0 = 0. In each
parametrization, Sets I and III have η0 close to 0, while
Set II present systematically higher absolute values for
η0.

The observational analysis give the diﬀerence between
Sets I and II up to ﬁve times higher than the diﬀerence
between Sets I and III. Are results suggest that a vio-
lation on the CDDR suﬀers a higher inﬂuence from the
angular diameter distance measurements than from the
luminosity distance measurements, thus if there is a trace
of a new physics in the CDDR the origin is most proba-
ble related with a geometric source, e.g. a change on the
assumption that the geometry is Riemannian. Although
our results is important to explore this method with new
surveys and more points in the data sets.
