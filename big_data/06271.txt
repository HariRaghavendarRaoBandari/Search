Abstract

The aim of this note is to use geometric methods to study the hit problem of Peterson
for H∗RP ×k as well as the symmetric hit problem of Janfada and Wood for H∗BO(k). We
continue by exploring the applications of the results of [26] on the A-annihilated generators
of H∗QX to obtain a family of generic ‘new’ examples of A-annihilated in H∗(Z × BO) and
H∗BO, i.e. the case of stable symmetric hit problem, where an essential step is provided by
the inﬁnite loop space structure on BO implied by the Bott periodicity. Applying a length
ﬁltration allows to state our results in the case of symmetric hit problem for H∗BO(k). Using
the Becker-Gottlieb transfer associated to RP ×k = BO(1)×k → BO(k) we are able to restate
our results for the classic hit problem of H∗RP ×k. We use the phrase ‘stable hit problem’ to
the study of hit problem for H∗RP ×k for all k > 0 at once, which allows to use multiplicative
structures on which we seem to have taken some new steps after [3].
Our new examples depend on speciﬁc numerical conditions of which we have provided an
algorithm to construct in [26]. The methodological outcome is that such conditions also have
to taken into account while dealing with counting arguments. The numerical conditions we
obtain seem to have not appeared in the literature in this context, although they may include
previous ones as examples. Therefore, our work provides an inﬁnite family of new examples
and consequently raises the lower bounds obtained previously.

Introduction and the main result

For a connected unstable left A-module M, the hit problem of Peterson asks for a minimal set of
generators for M over the Steenrod algebra A or equivalently a basis for the vector space F2 ⊗A M
where F2 is concentrated in grading 0 (see [25, Section 7] as well as [24] for a survey on the
problem); of particular interest are the cases when M = H ∗RP ×k with n > 0. The problem is
often considered by means of ﬁnding some bounds on dim(F2 ⊗A M)n in each grading n on which
Kameko’s conjecture was about, when M = H ∗RP ×k, which later on was disproved by Sum [22,
Theorem 1.2]. Similarly, the case for M = H ∗BO(k), known as the symmetric hit problem, has

1

been of interest [9]. The hit problem for the Dickson algebra also has been considered [14] where
the Dickson algebra is related to the dual of the Dyer-Lashof algebra by work of Madsen [11].
Probably the most relevant results to ours appear in a series of papers by Pegenlley and Davis
[17] (see also [16] as well as [15]) as well as Singer’s work [20] where the relation between Kudo-
Araki-May algebra and the hit problem has been studied. We conclude our review by noting that
most of the existing work on all of these three ‘hit’ problems has been in the realm of algebra; in
particular the numerical conditions that we obtain seem to have not appeared in the literature in
this context. Furthermore, most of the existing work is often is on Q(k) := F2 ⊗A H ∗RP ×k for
some ﬁxed k.
Our idea is to study the problems collectively, for all k, at once, as much as we can by means of
geometric methods. We note that previously, Ault and Singer [3] have considered studying the
hit problems collectively, although they still work in the realm of algebra. We consider the dual
of the hit problem for all H∗RP ×k; for M = H ∗X the hit problem is equivalent to determining
the submodule of H∗X that are annihilated by all elements of A+, the augmentation ideal of the
Steenrod algebra, that is referred to as the dual of the hit problem. Previously, by considering the
dual hit problem for H∗BO(k) when k varies, we have used the action of the Dyer-Lashof algebra
to obtain some information on the ‘stable’ dual hit problem for H∗BO which upon applying a
length ﬁltration provides us some information on the dual hit problem for H∗BO(k) [26]. The aim
of this note is to connect the dual hit problem for H∗RP ×k to the symmetric hit problem. This is
done by means of transfer maps BO(k) → BO(1)×k.

Throughout the paper, we work at the prime 2.

Our ﬁrst main observation in this note, which is somehow standard, is the following.

Theorem 1.1. Suppose d =Pl

s=1(2ǫs − 1) with ǫs > 0. Let k = k1 + · · · + kl with ks > 0. Then,
for any σ ∈ Σl, there exists an A-annihilated class ξσ ∈ HdRP ×k which is invariant under the
action of Σkσ(1) × · · · × Σkσ(l). Moreover, the distinct classes we obtain are linearly independent.

For a ﬁxed partition of k into l positive integers, under suitable conditions, the above theorem

would/should imply that

dim AnnA(HdRP ×k) > (k1 + 1) · · · (kl + 1)l!

where AnnA(H∗X) refers to the submodule of A-annihilated classes in H∗X. The complete state
of such conditions is not clear to me at the moment.

a nonnegative integer n with n = P+∞

Next, we turn to the main objective of this note, that is to relate the action of the Dyer-
Lashof algebra to the hit problem. We apply the results of [26] (see also [27, Theorem 2]). For
i=0 ni2i, ni ∈ {0, 1}, let ρ(n) = min{i : ni = 0}. For I =
(i1, . . . , ir) we write I = I0 and Ij = (ij+1, . . . , ir) for j < r. We deﬁne excess(I) = i1 −(i2 +· · ·+ir)
and |I| = i1 + · · · + ir. First, we record the the following which is on the relation between the
Dyer-Lashof algebra and the symmetric hit problem(s).

Theorem 1.2. (i) Suppose I = (i1, . . . , ir) is a sequence of positive integers satisfying

(1) 0 < excess(I) < 2ρ(i1), (2) 0 6 2ij+1 − ij < 2ρ(ij+1)

if r > 1, and (1) if r = 1. Then there exists an A-annihilated class ξI ∈ H|I|(Z × BO) so that

I = e0eexcess(I0)e2
ξBO

excess(I1) · · · e2r−1

excess(Ir−1) + other terms 6= 0.

2

(ii) If l(I) = r then the class e−1

0 ξBO

I

pulls back to H∗BO(2r − 1).

The above, together with suitable transfer map and the multiplicative structure ofLk H∗RP ×k,

allows to use the action of the Dyer-Lashof algebra to the hit problem.

Theorem 1.3. (i) Suppose I = (i1, . . . , ir) is a sequence of positive integers satisfying

(1) 0 < excess(I) < 2ρ(i1), (2) 0 6 2ij+1 − ij < 2ρ(ij+1)

if r > 1, and (1) if r = 1. Then there exists an A-annihilated class ξI ∈ H|I|RP ×(2r−1) so that for
any permutation τ ∈ Σ2r −1 we have

τ ξI = aexcess(I0) ⊗ a⊗2

excess(I1) ⊗ · · · ⊗ a⊗2r−1

excess(Ir−1) + other terms 6= 0

is an A-annihilated class in H|I|RP ×(2r−1).

s=1(2rs − 1) so that there exists sequences of positive integers I s with l(I s) = rs
and excess(I s) > 0 satisfying the above conditions. Then, there exists at most l! linearly indepen-

(ii) Suppose k =Pl
dent A-annihilated classes ξσ ∈ HdBO(k), σ ∈ Σl, with d = P |Is| which is invariant under the

rσ(1) −1 × · · · × Σ2

action of Σ2

rσ(l) −1.

We have a few comments in order. First, note that in the above theorem, we have allowed
sequences of nonnegative integer. If K = (1, 0, 2) is given, then eK = e1
3. Second, it
does not seem very sensible to talk about uniqueness of the classes ξτ ’s with no restrictions. The
reason is that if eK := ek1
n is a monomial of ξτ then it will be a monomial of ζ + ξτ for any
A-annihilated class ζ. Thirdly, in order to justify the signiﬁcance of the above observation, note

by examining Sq1
∗ one can see that it is A-annihilated - this is an easy consequence
of Lemma 3.1. On the other hand, a class such as a2 ⊗ a5 is not A-annihilated as for instance
Sq1
(ii) Similarly, one can show that a1 ⊗ a2 + a2 ⊗ a1 ∈ H3RP ×2.
(iii) By the external Cartan formula, we deduce that there is an A-annihilated class in H10RP ×4
which has a term of the form, a1 ⊗ a2 ⊗ a2 ⊗ a5, the class being given by the product of the above

class Pi+j=7,i>0,j>0(a1 ⊗ a2 ⊗ ai ⊗ aj + a2 ⊗ a1 ⊗ ai ⊗ aj). Similarly, the class Pi+j=7,i>0,j>0(ai ⊗

aj ⊗ a1 ⊗ a2 + ai ⊗ aj ⊗ a1 ⊗ a2). By the noncommutativity of the product the two classes are linearly
independent. Both classes are invariant under the action of Σ2 × Σ2.

2 Recollections

2.1 The algebras Dyer-Lashof algebra R

We begin with brieﬂy recalling the construction of the Dyer-Lashof algebra R (see [23, Chapter
5] for more details). Now, let Θ be the free graded associated algebra over F2 generated with

3

generators λi in grading i > 0. For a > 2b, let

RΛ(a, b) = λbλa + Xa+b63t

2t − a (cid:19)λtλa+b−t.
(cid:18)t − b − 1

(1)

We then deﬁne the Λ algebra by

Λ := Θ/hRΛ(a, b) : a > 2bi.

We keep using λi for the image of λi in Λ. Hence, whenever a > 2b we have the relations

λbλa = Xa+b63t

2t − a (cid:19)λtλa+b−t
(cid:18)t − b − 1

in Λ which we refer to them as the Adem relations for the Λ algebra. For a sequence of nonnegative
integers I = (i1, . . . , is) we write λI for λis · · · λi1. We shall refer to I as admissible if ij 6 2ij+1
for all 1 6 j 6 s − 1. We shall refer to l(I) = s and excess(I) = i1 − (i2 + · · · + is) as length and
excess of I respectively. The Dyer-Lashof algebra R is deﬁned by

R := Λ/hλI : excess(I) < 0i.

We write Qi1 · · · Qis for the image of λis · · · λi1 in R under the natural projection, deﬁning excess(QI) =
excess(I) and l(QI) = l(I). In this algebra, whenever a > 2b, we have Adem relations as

QaQb = Xa+b63t

2t − a (cid:19)Qa+b−tQt.
(cid:18)t − b − 1

(2)

The elements of R are known as the Kudo-Araki or Kudo-Araki-Dyer-Lashof operations.

2.2 The action of R on H∗QX

It is known that R acts on homology ring of any inﬁnite loop space Y [7, Part I, Theorem 1.1]
turning the homology algebra of the inﬁnite loop space into an R-module. The action is determined
throughout considering Qi, i > 0, as a group homomorphism

Qi : H∗Y → H∗+iY

for all n, having various properties of which we recall the following:
(1) Qnx = x2 if dim x = n, and Qix = 0 if dim x > n;

(2) Qi(xy) =Pt(Qi−tx)(Qty) (Cartan formula) for all x, y ∈ H∗Y .

(3) Qif∗ = f∗Qi for f : X → Y any map of spaces.
Suppose X is path connected, then the unreduced homology of QX = colim ΩiΣiX, as an algebra
and as a module over R, is described as follows [7, Part I, Lemma 4.10]

H∗QX ≃ F2[QIxµ : I is admissble , excess(QIxµ) > 0]

where {xµ} is an additive basis for the reduced homology eH∗X, I = (i1, . . . , is), is called admissible

in the sense of R, i.e. ij 6 2ij+1 when s > 1 (for s = 1 we assume I always to be admissible), and
QI is an abbreviation for the iterated operation Qi1 · · · Qis. The excess is deﬁned by excess(QIxµ) =
i1 − (i2 + · · · + is + dim xµ) = excess(I) − dim xµ, allowing the empty sequence φ to be admissible

4

with Qφξ = ξ and excess(Qφxµ) = +∞.
For homology of Q0(X+), the base point component of Q(X+), where X+ denotes X with a
disjoint base point, we proceed as follows. Write [n] for the image of n ∈ π0Q(X+) ≃ πs
0(X+) ≃ Z
in H0(Q(X+); Z) under the Hurewicz homomorphism. Then, we have

H∗(Q0(X+); F2) ≃ F2[QI xµ ∗ [−2l(I)] : I is admissble , excess(QI xµ) > 0]

where ∗ is the Pontrjagin product in H∗(Q(X+); F2). Note that QIxµ∗[−2l(I)] is not a decomposable
in Q0(X+) whereas it is in Q(X+). Let’s note that for a path connected space X, π0Q(X+) ≃ Z
where all path components have the same homotopy type. Writing Qi(X+) for the path component
corresponding to i ∈ π0Q(X+) then multiplication by [j] provides us with a translation map
Qi(X+) → Qi+j(X+) which is a homotopy equivalence. This then allows us to use H∗Q0(X+) to
describe H∗Q(X+). In the particular case of X = ∗, we have

H∗QS0 ≃ H∗Q0S0[[1], [−1]] ≃ [QI[1], [1], [−1] : I admissible].

Here, multiplying by powers of [1] and [−1] allows to translate between diﬀerent path components
of QS0. Similarly, in H∗(Z × BO) multiplying by e0 or e−1
0 has the eﬀect of changing the path
component (see section 2.4 for a description of H∗(Z × BO)).

2.3 On the homotopy of Z × BO

The space BO is ﬁltered by subspace BO(n) whose successive quotients are BO(n)/BO(n − 1) ≃
MO(n) the Thom complex of the universal n-plane bundle γ → BO(n). In fact, there is a stable
splitting [13]

BO(n) ≃

n_k=1

MO(k)

which yield a stable splitting BO ≃ W+∞

k=1 MO(k). On the other hand, by Bott peroidicity, the
space Z × BO, as well as its base point component BO, are inﬁnite loop spaces with the monoid
structure coming from the Whitney sum. This means that there is a structure map [12] (see also
[4])

θ : Q(Z × BO) −→ Z × BO

which is a map of inﬁnite loop spaces, so that the composition Z × BO → Q(Z × BO) −→ Z × BO
is the identity. The map θ is an evaluation map which allows to have an action of the Dyer-Lashof
algebra R on H∗(Z × BO).

2.4 On the homology of Z × BO

We start with describing H∗(Z × BO) for which [18] is our main reference. Consider ι : RP →

{1} × BO and let ei ∈ Hi({1} × BO) be ei = ι∗ai where ai ∈ eHiRP ≃ F2 is a generator. Also,

Consider S0 = {0, 1} and let χ : S0 → Z × BO send 0 into {0} × BO and 1 to {1} × BO.
By inﬁnite loop space structure of Z × BO, the extension of χ to an inﬁnite loop map is a map
χ : QS0 Qχ
0 = χ∗[−1]. Then, we have
an isomorphism of algebras

→ Q(Z × BO) θ→ Z × BO. In homology, letting e0 = χ∗[1], e−1

H∗(Z × BO) ∼= F2[e0, e−1

0 , ei : deg ei = i]

in which H∗BO ≃ F2[ei : i > 0] sits as a subalgebra. The following is due to Priddy [18, Proposition
4.1, case of n=1].

5

Proposition 2.1. The map χ : QS0 → Z × BO is an epimorphism in homology.

Write QdS0 for the component of QS0 corresponding to stable maps S0 → S0 of degree d, and
∗[d] : QiS0 → Qi+dS0 for the translation induced a loop sum with a stable map of degree d, which
in fact is a homotopy equivalence between diﬀerent components of QS0. Let λ : RP → Q0S0 be the
Kahn-Priddy map which we know [10, Theorem 3.1] (see also [21, Page 31]) that λ∗ai = Qi[1]∗[−2].
Hence, if we consider the composition [1] ∗ λ : RP → Q1S0 we have ([1] ∗ λ)∗ai = Qi[1] ∗ [−1].
On the other hand, the map RP → {1} × BO does in fact factor through the restriction of χ,
Q1S0 → {1} × BO as

By deﬁnition, ei = ι∗ai which combined with the above implies that

ι : RP

χ

−→ {1} × BO.

ei = χ∗(Qi[1] ∗ [−1]) = Qie0 ∗ e−1

0 ⇒ ei = Qie0 ∗ e−1
0 .

This implies that -

Lemma 2.2. Let Qi : H∗(Z × BO) → H∗+i(Z × BO) be the operation coming from the inﬁnite
loop structure on Z × BO corresponding to Bott periodicity. Then, we have

H∗(Z × BO) ≃ F2[e0, e−1

0 , Qie0 : i > 0].

Note that by the above computations, Qie0 = e0ei. In general, the action of Qi operations on
the generators of H∗(Z × BO) is computed by Priddy Priddy [18, Theorem 1.1], [18, Corollary 2.3]
(see also [21]).

as they follow from basic properties of Kudo-Araki operations that

2.5 The eﬀect of θ∗

The space Q(Z × BO) also has an inﬁnite loop space structure coming from Q, hence providing
action of the Dyer-Lashof algebra R on H∗Q(Z × BO). For a moment, we write Qi for the

6

operations coming from this loop space structure. The eﬀect of θ∗ : H∗Q(Z × BO) → H∗(Z × BO)
is determined by

θ∗Qiek = Qiek

together with the fact that that θ is an inﬁnite loop map. Hence, the statement of Theorem 2.3
maybe rephrased using θ∗ as well.
In particular, for a nonempty sequence of positive integers
I = (i1, . . . , ir), if QIek ∈ H∗Q(Z × BO) is an A-annihilated element then QIek = θ∗(QIek) ∈
H∗(Z × BO) is an A-annihilated class.

2.6 Homology of BO(n)

We start with the description given in [2]. Let µk : BO(1)×k → BO(k) be the classifying map for
γ×k

1 , write ai ∈ eHiRP ≃ F2 for a generator, and let

ei1 · · · eik := (µk)∗(ai1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ aik).

Note that µk is Σk-equivariant, so that ei1 · · · eik = eσ(i1) · · · eσ(ik) for any σ ∈ Σk. We then may
represent H∗BO(k) as

H∗BO(k) ≃ F2{ei1 · · · eik : 0 6 i1 6 · · · 6 ik}

where F2{X} denotes the F2-vector space generated by the set X. Note that we may take e0
as the image of a0 = 1 in H0RP , and therefor within H∗BO(n) we may use the identiﬁcation
e0ei = ei. This shouldn’t be confused with any multiplication in H∗BO(n) (which doesn’t have
one). The homology of the inclusion maps jnm : BO(n) → BO(m) and jn : BO(n) → BO then
is determined in an obvious manner; jnm, n < m, and jn induces the evident A-module maps in
homology sends ei1 · · · ein identically to itself. Moreover, the inclusion maps in : BO(n) → BO
induces a monomorphism of A-modules; the submodule of H∗BO spanned by elements of length
no more than n, ei1 · · · ein, fall into the image of in in homology. Finally, we note that we may use

2.7 Basic properties of dual Steenrod operations

Cartan formulae. For space X and Y , the external Cartan formula is give by

Sqt

∗(x ⊗ y) = Xt1+t2=t

(Sqt1

∗ x) ⊗ (Sqt2

∗ y).

If we are equipped with a pairing m : X × Y → Z then the naturality of the Steedrod operation
together with the above formula implies that

Sqt

∗(xy) = Xt1+t2=t

(Sqt1

∗ x)(Sqt2

∗ y)

where xy := m(x ⊗ y). In particular, for X = Y = Z being an H-space with m the multiplication
of the H-space, the above formula proves to be useful (see also[23, Chapter 5]). We may refer to
this latter relation as the internal Cartan formula in order to distinguish it from the former.

Lemma 2.4. Let AnnA(X) = ⊕nAnnA(HnX). Then for X = RP ×k, AnnA(X) is a subalgebra of
H∗X which is dual to the quotient module of F2 ⊗A H ∗X.

7

Proof. For X = RP ×k is an H-space, the homology H∗X is a Hopf algebra. The internal Cartan
formula implies that AnnA(X) is a subalgebra of H∗X. The duality follows using Kronecker
pairing.

Equivariance. Our main theorem follows upon making some speciﬁc choices, provided by the
invariance of the action of the Steenrod algebra on speciﬁc elements where the latter is an outcome
of equivariance property of the action. More precisely we have the following.

Lemma 2.5. (i) The action of A on the elements x1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ xk ∈ H∗RP ×k is Σk-invariant for all
k > 0. Similar statement hold for the action on H∗RP ∧k.
(ii) The action of A on H∗ΩΣRP is Σk-equivariant on the elements of length k.

Let’s note that the lemma is valid if we replace RP with any suitable CW -complex. However,

we like to emphasis on the case which is important for us.

Proof. (i) It is readily veriﬁed by the external Cartan formula that Sqt
∗ for any σ ∈ Σk.
(ii) This follows from part (i) together with James splitting (see subsection 3.1) and that Steenrod
operations are stable.

∗σ = σSqt

Invariance of length. By the above Cartan formulae, the Steenrod operations Sqt

∗ respect
length. This is clear in RP ×k or ΩΣRP . Moreover, according to our description of H∗BO, H∗(Z ×
BO) as well as H∗BO(n) may associate a notion of length to the elements of these homologies. In
particular, we associate length k to e0ei1 · · · eik as well as to ei1 · · · eik whenever i1 > 0.

2.8 The transfer BO(k) → BO(1)×k

The proof of our main result is an standard argument based on transfer. Consider the ﬁbre bundle
BO(1)×k → BO(k) and the Becker-Gottlieb transfer t : BO(k) → BO(1)×k [5] (see also [19] and
[1, Chapter 4]). The following is standard, see for example [6, Theorem 3.11].

Lemma 2.6. The transfer t : BO(k) → BO(1)×k satisﬁes

t∗(ek1

1 · · · ekn

n ) = Xτ ∈Σk

τ (a⊗k1

1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ a⊗kn

)

where Σk acts by permutation of the factors.

3 Diagonal subalgebras: Proof of Theorem 1.1

Let ψ : RP → RP ×k be the k-fold diagonal map. In homology, this is given by

ψ∗an = Xi1+···+ik=n

ai1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ aik

with ij > 0 where we reserve a0 = 1. The above sum involves terms such as 1 ⊗· · · 1 ⊗an ⊗1 · · ·⊗1.
Moreover, recall the external Cartan formula,

Sqt(ai1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ aik) = Xt1+···+tn=t

Sqt1

∗ ai1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ Sqtn

∗ aik .

The latter formula implies that if an is A-annihilated, so is 1 ⊗ · · · 1 ⊗ an ⊗ 1 · · · ⊗ 1. Moreover, if
an is A-annihilated then ψ∗an is. These together imply that -

Lemma 3.1. Suppose n = 2l − 1, i.e. al ∈ HlRP is an A-annihilated class. Then, for any k, the

RP ∧k. Moreover, the classes 1 ⊗ · · · 1 ⊗

Note that the A-annihilated classes identiﬁed in the above lemma, are invariant under the
action of Σk. This implies that in homology they belong to the kernel of RP ×k → BO(k). The
linear independence, implies the following.

Corollary 3.2. For k > 1, dim(AnnA(H2l−1

RP ×k) > k + 1.

3.1 James splitting and the hit problem

Let’s begin with the obvious pairings (in fact homeomorphisms) mn,m : RP ×n×RP ×m → RP ×(n+m),
n, m > 0, which classiﬁes γ×n
1 with γ1 → RP being the universal line bundle. In homology,
the pairings H∗RP ×n ⊗ H∗RP ×m ≃ H∗(RP ×n × RP ×m) → RP ×(n+m) are given by juxtaposition,
i.e.

1 × γ×m

(mn,m)∗((ai1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ ain) ⊗ (aj1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ ajm)) = ai1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ ain ⊗ aj1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ ajm.

The above pairings also induce pairings mn,m : RP ∧n × RP ∧m → RP ∧(n+m) which previously were
considered by [3]. These pairing behave similar to the mn,m’s in homology. Moreover, they also
ﬁt in well with James’ splitting. Recall for a path connected space X, James splitting provides a
stable equivalence

i.e. stably ΩΣX is the same as Wk X ∧k. Moreover, the homology of ΩΣX is an algebra,

ΣΩΣX ≃

ΣX ∧k

H∗(ΩΣX; Z) ≃ T (eH∗(X; Z))

Lemma 3.3. Suppose d =Pl
Proof. Let ξs := Pis

where T is the free tensor algebra functor. Hence, studying the A-annihilated classes in H∗ΩΣX
amounts to studying the hit problem for X ∧k collectively. Conversely, attempting to study the hit
problem for H∗X ∧k all at once allows to use the multiplicative structure of H∗ΩΣX.

any σ ∈ Σl, there exists an A-annihilated class ξσ ∈ HdRP ×k which is invariant under the action
of Σkσ(1) × · · · × Σkσ(l).

By the external Cartan formula this class is A-annihilated. Moreover, if we choose is

the classes belong to H∗RP ∧ks and the product can be seen to taken in ΩΣRP . Finally, note
that the classes ξs are invariant under the action of Σks, so ξσ is invariant under the action of

The invariance under the action implies that the image of the classes in the above lemma gets

4 The algebra R and the hit problems

Recall that using results of [8, Lemma 6.2] as well as [23, Lemma 12.5] we were able to describe
the A-annihilated generators of H∗QX as following [26, Theorem 1] (see also [27, Theorem 2]).
Theorem 4.1. (i) Let QIx be a generator of H∗QX with I = (i1, . . . , is). The class QIx is

A-annihilated if and only if (1) x ∈ eH∗X is A-annihilated, (2) excess(QIx) < 2ρ(i1), and (3)

0 6 2ij+1 − ij < 2ρ(ij+1), 1 6 j 6 s − 1. If s = 1 then the ﬁrst two conditions determine all
A-annihilated classes of the form Qix of positive excess.
(ii) Let QIx ∗ [−2l(I)] be a monomial generator of H∗Q0(X+) with I = (i1, . . . , is). This class is

A-annihilated if and only if the following conditions are satisﬁed: (1) x ∈ eH∗X is A-annihilated;

(2) excess(QIx) < 2ρ(i1); and (3) 0 6 2ij+1 − ij < 2ρ(ij+1), 1 6 j 6 s − 1. If s = 1 then the ﬁrst
two conditions determine all A-annihilated classes of the form Qix ∗ [−2] of positive excess.

It is quite straightforward to show that a sequence I satisfying the conditions of the above

theorem must only consist of odd entries.

We shall use the above result in the case of X = Z × BO or X = BO to compute A-annihilated
generators of H∗Q(Z × BO) or H∗QBO respectively. Next, we consider applying the map θ∗ in
order to obtain A-annihilated classes in H∗(Z × BO) or H∗BO in terms of QI operations. Finally,
by Priddy’s computations, recalled in Theorem 2.3, after making some speciﬁc choices, we to
complete our computations in the case of stable symmetric hit problem. The other computations
immediately follow from this case. The computations here are analogous to [26, Section 7].

4.1 The symmetric hit problem

This part is devoted to the proof of Theorem 1.2. Suppose I = (i1, . . . , ir) is a sequence of positive
integers satisfying

(1) 0 < excess(I) < 2ρ(i1), (2) 0 6 2ij+1 − ij < 2ρ(ij+1)

if r > 1, and (1) if r = 1. By Theorem 4.1 above, noting that e0 is already A-annihilated, we see
that QIe0 ∈ H∗Q(Z × BO) as well as θ∗(QIe0) = QIe0 ∈ H∗(Z × BO) are A-annihilated classes.
All remains is to show that this class is not trivial. We begin with a recording a triviality.

Lemma 4.2. Suppose I = (i1, . . . , ir) be a nonempty sequence and let exj = excess(Ij) = ij+1 −
(ij+2+· · ·+ir). Then I is admissible if and only if (ex0, . . . , exj−1) is nondecreasing, i.e. exj 6 exj+1
for all j. In particular, if excess(I) > 0 then exj > for all j.

The reader who is familiar with lower indexed Kudo-Araki operation will note that this is
just implicitly working with lower-indexed operations in homology of loop spaces. The following
statement is enough general for our purpose, which is probably well known, but we include a proof
here.

Lemma 4.3. Suppose I = (i1, . . . , ir) is an admissible sequence. Then, in H∗(Z × BO) we have

QI e0 = e0eex0e2

ex1 · · · e2r−1

exr−1 + OI 6= 0.

For r = 1, OI = 0. For r > 1,

where ǫJ ∈ F2 and the sum runs over all sequences of nonnegative integers L = (l1, . . . , l2r−1) so
that for some j, lj > exr−1 = ir.

OI =X ǫLe0eL

10

Note that exr−1 = excess(Ir−1) = ir.

Proof. For r = 1, I = (ir) and Qir e0 = e0eir 6= 0. In particular, the are no other terms. So, the
statement holds for r = 1.
We now prove the case for r > 1. We proceed by providing a more explicit expression for OI from
which the above formulation of OI will follow. For I = (i1, . . . , ir), j > 0, we set dj = |Ij| =
ij+1 + · · · + ir. Clearly, dj > exj, and dr−1 = ir.
We proceed by induction, and in order to make an illustration, we do the cases r = 2, 3. First, let
r = 2. We compute that

Qir−1Qir e0 = Qir−1(e0eir ) =

ir−1Xβr−1=0

(Qir−1−βr−1e0)(Qβr−1eir ).

By basic properties of Kudo-Araki operations, Qβr−1eir = 0 unless βr−1 > ir. Hence, noting that
Qβr−1e0 = e0eβr−1, we may write

Qir−1Qir e0 =

ir−1Xβr−1=dr−1

e0eir−1−βr−1(Qβr−1eir ).

(3)

Separating the case βr−1 = dr−1 = ir (ir−1 − βr−1 = exr−2) we obtain

Qir−1Qir e0 = e0eexr−2e2

ir +

ir−1Xβr−1=dr−1+1

(e0eir−1−βr−1(Qβr−1eir ).

Now, by Priddy’s formula, for βr−1 ∈ {dr−1 + 1, . . . , ir−1}, the part Qβr−1eir in the second sum is
computed by

Qβr−1eir =

irXur−1=0

(cid:18)βr−1 − ir + ur−1 − 1

ur−1

(cid:19)eβr−1+ur−1eir−ur−1.

Clearly for the terms eβr−1+ur−1eir−ur−1, βr−1 + ur−1 > dr−1 > exr−1. The binomial coeﬃcients in
the formula, give the ǫ coeﬃcients claimed in the formula. This veriﬁes our expression for the case
r = 2.
Now, let r = 3. By similar methods, using equation (3) we compute that

Qir−2Qir−1Qir e0 = Qir−2(

e0eir−1−βr−1(Qβr−1eir ))

ir−1Xβr−1=dr−1
ir−1Xβr−1=dr−1

=

ir−2Xβr−2=dr−2

(Qir−2−βr−2e0)(Qβr−2(eir−1−βr−1(Qβr−1eir ))).

First, as the case of r = 2, we may separate the cases with βr−1 = dr−1 and βr−2 = dr−2 which leads
to the ‘leading term’ e0eex0e2
for βr−2 ∈ {dr−2 + 1, . . . , ir−2}, we obtain

ex2. Moreover, applying the Cartan formula to Qβr−2(eir−1−βr−1(Qβr−1eir )),

ex1e22

Qβr−2(eir−1−βr−1(Qβr−1eir )) =

βr−2Xαr−2=βr−1+ir

11

(Qir−2−αr−2eir−1−βr−1)(Qαr−2Qβr−1eir ).

ex1e22

Applying Priddy’s formula twice to the part Qαr−2Qβr−1eir we obtain terms eiejekel with l >
exr−1 = ir. Noting that exj < exj+1 this means that el is not equal to any of the factors in the
leading term e0eex0e2
ex2. So, they do not cancel each other, that is in the case l(I) = r = 3,
QI e0 6= 0. This veriﬁes our claim in the case of r = 3.
Now, suppose I ′ = (i′, i1, . . . , ir) is an admissible sequence with excess(I ′) > 0. This means
I = (i1, . . . , ir) is also admissible with excess(I) > 0 and by inductive hypothesis we have QIe0 =
e0eexcess(I0)e2
excess(Ir−1) + OI 6= 0 with OI as above. By Cartan formula, for the ﬁrst term
we have

excess(I1) · · · e2r−1

(e0eex0e2

ex1 · · · e2r−1

exr−1) = Xt0+···+tr=i′

(Qt0e0) · · · (Qtr e2r−1

exr−1).

Qi′

We may write

i′ = 2r−1ir + 2r−2(ir−1 − ir) + · · · + 2(i1 − i2 − · · · − ir) + (i′ − i1 − i2 − · · · − ir)

= 2r−1exr−1 + · · · + ex0 + excess(I ′)

which allows to separate one term of the sum and the other terms and write

Qi′

(e0eex0e2

ex1 · · · e2r−1

exr−1) = e0eexcess(I ′)e2

ex0 · · · e2r

exr−1 +X(Qt0e0) · · · (Qtr e2r−1

(4)

where the sum is running over all sequenceP tj = i′ so that (t0, t1, . . . , tr) 6= (excess(I ′), ex0, 2ex1, . . . , 2r−1exr−1

ex0 · · · e2r

The term e0eexcess(I ′)e2
exr−1 is the ‘leading term’ as claimed. By Cartan formula, we have
Q2t+1ξ2 = 0 and Q2tξ2 = (Qtξ)2. In particular, this implies that Qtj e2j−1
exj−1 = 0 unless tj = 2j−1pj
for some positive integer pj. Hence, we may suppose that for j > 1, tj = 2j−1pj for some positive
exj−1 = (Qpj eexj−1)2j−1. Note that in the above relations, for dimensional
integer pj. Therefore, Qtj e2j−1
reasons, in order to eliminate the cases Qtr e2r−1
exr−1 = 0, we may consider terms with tj > 2j−1exj−1,
i.e. pj > exj−1. As we have excluded the leading terms, then we may only consider terms with
pj > exj−1 for all j. Consequently, for j = r, we have pr > exr−1 = ir, so the expression for
Qpr eir will give rise to terms eiel with l > ir. This means that in the expression for the sum in
equation(4) any term has el > ir > exj for all j < r. Hence, none of these terms does cancel out
with the leading term. Similar reasoning is in place to the term of Qi′OI after using the inductive
hypothesis which we leave to the reader.

We know may complete the proof of Theorem 1.2 as follows.

Proof of theorem 1.2. (i) The class e0 is A-annihilated. Choose I as in Theorem 4.1 so that
QI e0 ∈ H|I|Q(Z × BO) is A-annihilated. This implies that θ∗(QIe0) = QI e0, which by previous
lemma is a nontrivial class in H|I|(Z × BO), is an A-annihilated class. Set ξBO
I = QIe0 which has
the desired properties.
(ii) By computations in the previous lemma, every term in the expression for QIe0 is of the form
e0eL with l(L) = 2r − 1. Hence, the class e−1
is in the image of H∗BO(2r − 1) → H∗BO,
induced by the inclusion BO(2r − 1) → BO, which is a monomorphism of A-modules.

4.2 The nonsymmetric hit problem: Proof of Theorem 1.3

This section demonstrates an application of the Dyer-Lashof algebra to the study of hit problem
as promised at the beginning. The idea is to use transfer map BO(k) → RP ×k which induces a
monomorphism of A-modules by our computations in previous sections. We have the following.

12

Theorem 4.4. (i) Suppose I = (i1, . . . , ir) is a sequence of positive integers satisfying the above
conditions with excess(I) > 0. Then there exists an A-annihilated class ξI ∈ H|I|RP ×2r so that for
any permutation τ ∈ Σ2r we have

τ ξI = aexcess(I0) ⊗ a⊗2

excess(I1) ⊗ · · · ⊗ a⊗2r−1

excess(Ir−1) + other terms 6= 0

is an A-annihilated class in H|I|RP ×2r .
(ii) Suppose k = 2r1+· · ·+2rl so that there exists sequences of positive integers I s with l(I s) = rs and
excess(I s) > 0 satisfying the above conditions. Then, there exists at most l! linearly independent

A-annihilated classes ξσ ∈ HdBO(k), σ ∈ Σl, with d =P |Is| which is invariant under the action

rσ(1) × · · · × Σ2

of Σ2

rσ(l) .

Proof. (i) Choose ξI = t∗(e−1
the pull back in
BO(2r − 1). The invariance under the action of symmetric group is clear from the formula for
transfer.
(ii) Let ξI s be the A-annihilated class associated to I s where s = 1, . . . , l. For σ ∈ Σl let

) where by abuse of notation we write e−1

0 ξBO

To see that the maximum of l! can be attained, it is straightforward if we have i 6= j ⇒ ri 6= rj.
This completes the proof.
