ABSTRACT

Aims. We study the diﬀerences in the heavy ion composition of solar energetic particle (SEP) events between solar cycles 23 and 24.
Methods. We have surveyed the SOHO/ERNE heavy ion data from the beginning of solar cycle 23 until the end of June 2015, that
is, well into the declining phase of cycle 24. We used this long observation period to study the properties of heavy ions (from C to
Fe) and to compare the two solar cycles in this respect. We surveyed the data for SEP events with enhancements in the Fe/C and
Fe/O intensity ratios in the energy range 5–15 MeV per nucleon, and associated the events with solar ﬂare and coronal mass ejections
(CME) when possible. We studied the properties of heavy ions in these events and compared the average relative abundances of heavy
ions between the two solar cycles.
Results. We found that fewer days had C and O intensities higher than ~10 −3 cm−2sr−1s−1(MeVn−1)−1 during solar cycle 24 than
during cycle 23. For Fe this diﬀerence was clear even at lower intensities. We also found that fewer days had Fe/(C+O) > 0.183
during cycle 24. We identiﬁed 86 SEP events with at least one Fe-rich day, 65 of which occurred during cycle 23 and only 21 during
cycle 24. We found that impulsive events have been almost completely absent during cycle 24. Mean abundances of heavy ions in the
events were found to be signiﬁcantly lower during cycle 24 than in cycle 23. Our results reﬂect the reduced solar activity in cycle 24
and indicate lower eﬃciency of particle acceleration processes for both gradual and impulsive SEP events in cycle 24.

Key words. Sun: abundances - Sun: activity - Sun: particle emission

1. Introduction

The earliest observations of solar energetic particle (SEP) events
were obtained with ionization chambers (Forbush 1946). These
events, known today as ground-level enhancement (GLE) events,
were presumed to be caused by solar ﬂares. In a compre-
hensive review of radio observations, Wild et al. (1963) sug-
gested that the fast-drift type III radio bursts were produced
by ﬂare-accelerated outward streaming electrons, whereas slow-
drift type II bursts were produced by electrons accelerated by
shock waves that might also accelerate protons. This idea of
two diﬀerent physical mechanisms of SEP acceleration that con-
tribute to the two classes of solar particle events, namely impul-
sive and gradual events, has been widely accepted (e.g., Reames
2013). In the two-class paradigm, particle acceleration in impul-
sive ﬂares has been associated with resonant wave-particle inter-
actions (e.g., Fisk 1978; Temerin & Roth 1992; Miller & Viñas
1993; Zhang 1995; Paesold et al. 2003), stochastic acceleration
by plasma waves or turbulence (e.g., Möbius et al. 1980, 1982;
Petrosian & Liu 2004; Liu et al. 2004, 2006), or magnetic re-
connection (e.g., Drake et al. 2009), but none of the theories
have been able to provide a complete description of the ob-
served properties of impulsive events. Gradual events, on the
other hand, are commonly described by diﬀusive acceleration
at shock waves driven by coronal mass ejections (CMEs) (e.g.,
Cane 1995; Cliver et al. 1999). Impulsive events typically have
durations of a few hours, low ﬂuences, and compact spatial
scales, compared to the duration of several days, higher ﬂuences,
and extensive spatial scales of gradual events (e.g., Kahler 1992;
Reames 1999, 2013).

A key feature in distinguishing the two classes of solar par-
ticle events has been the diﬀerences in their energetic particle
composition. In general, impulsive events are considered to be
electron rich, to have 3He/4He ratios enhanced by a factor of
up to 104 , and Fe/O ratios enhanced by up to a factor of 10
compared to coronal values (e.g., Reames et al. 1985; Reames
1988). Gradual events, on the other hand, have an energetic par-
ticle composition similar to that of the corona or solar wind
(e.g., Meyer 1985). Early measurements of heavy ion charge
states showed that the mean ionic charge states in impulsive
events were signiﬁcantly higher than in gradual events (e.g.,
Klecker et al. 1984; Luhn et al. 1987). More recent studies at
extended energy ranges have revealed a more complex picture:
ion charge states in impulsive events are highly energy depen-
dent, with QFe increasing by as much as six charge units be-
tween ~0.1–0.5 MeV (DiFabio et al. 2008). In gradual events
the mean charge states at low energies are similar to those of
the solar wind, but show high variability at higher energies (e.g.,
Klecker et al. 2006, and references therein).

In reality, the separation of the two classes is not clear:
residual suprathermal ions from impulsive events may con-
tribute to the seed material accelerated by CME-driven shock
waves, resulting in intermediate values for 3He/4He or heavy
element abundances (e.g., Mason et al. 1999; Torsti et al. 2002;
Kocharov & Torsti 2002, 2003; Tylka et al. 2005). As a diﬀerent
explanation for the intermediate abundances, Cane et al. (2003,
2006) have argued in favor of a direct ﬂare component or a com-
bination of direct ﬂare particles and the shock acceleration of
these particles during large SEP events.

The current solar cycle, cycle 24, has shown a considerably
lower overall activity level than the previous cycle 23. This has
also left clear imprints on the SEP events. For example, GLEs
have shown a dramatic decrease in number from 16 in cycle 23
to only one in cycle 24 (Gopalswamy et al. 2013)1. In this paper
we compare the number and properties of iron-rich SEP events
for the two solar cycles. A preliminary analysis was performed in
Raukunen et al. (2015). The structure of this paper is as follows:
in Sect. 2 we present an overview of the observations we used,
in Sect. 3.1 we study the daily heavy ion intensities and intensity
ratios during the previous and the current solar cycle, in Sect.
3.2 we select a list of SEP events that contain enhancements in
Fe, in Sects. 3.3 and 3.4 we study the solar event associations
and properties of heavy ions in the selected events, and in Sect.
4 we summarize the results and present the conclusions of the
study. Appendix A includes technical details about the ﬁtting and
statistical testing.

2. Observations

The particle observations were made with the Energetic and
Relativistic Nuclei and Electron (ERNE) instrument onboard
the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) (Torsti et al.
1995; Valtonen et al. 1997). ERNE consists of two particle de-
tectors, the Low Energy Detector (LED) and High Energy De-
tector (HED). Our analysis was made in the energy range of 5–15
MeV n−1, which is measured by LED. It has a geometric factor
of 0.260–0.915 cm2sr, depending on particle energy and species.
As SOHO was launched on 2 December 1995 and is still opera-

1 In addition, one SEP event has led to a counting-rate increase of two
neutron monitors at the south pole (Thakur et al. 2014), but this is not
included in the oﬃcial list of GLEs (http://gle.oulu.fi/) because
the event did not produce statistically signiﬁcant increases in other sta-
tions

tional, the observation period extends from the end of solar cycle
22 well into the current solar cycle 24. There have been some
breaks in the observations, most notably from 25 June 1998 to 9
October 1998, from 21 December 1998 to 8 February 1999, and
from 9 December 2012 to 8 February 2013. These, along with all
the shorter breaks, have been taken into account in the following
analysis.

As an example of the ERNE/LED long-term heavy ion data,
the bottom panel of Fig. 1 shows the annual average intensities of
5–15 MeV n−1 C, O, and Fe for 1996–2015. The top panel shows
the annual intensity ratios Fe/C and Fe/O for the same time pe-
riod. The shape of the intensity proﬁles reﬂects the solar activity
level. The values marked with arrows for 2007 are one-count
upper limits because no Fe ions were detected during the year
by the instrument in the 5–15 MeV n−1 energy range. The an-
nual Fe/C and Fe/O ratios show fairly stable if slightly declining
trends during the active years 1997–2006 and 2011–2014. Dur-
ing the years of low solar activity, the ratios Fe/C and Fe/O have
average values of approximately 0.05 and 0.005, respectively,
which are much lower than the value for Fe/O in the corona
(0.186, measured at 1.4 · 106 K (Feldman & Widing 2003)), for
example, or the values for Fe/O in the slow and fast solar wind
(0.120 and 0.092, measured at 1 keV and 2 keV, respectively
(von Steiger et al. 2000)).

We here compare the properties of heavy ions in solar cycles
23 and 24. The start times and the times of the solar activity max-
ima are presented in Table 1. We deﬁned the start of the cycle as
the middle of the month with the lowest monthly sunspot num-
ber during the corresponding minimum. Both November and De-
cember 2008 had the same sunspot number, therefore the start of
cycle 24 was deﬁned as 1 December 2008. Similarly, the time of
maximum of the cycle was deﬁned as the middle of the month
with the highest monthly sunspot number. Cycles 23 and 24 were
both double-peaked, and the maximum sunspot numbers were
reached during the ﬁrst peak of cycle 23 and the second peak of
cycle 24. The sunspot data we used was the NOAA smoothed
monthly international sunspot number 2.

3. Results and discussion

We started our investigation by inspecting daily average inten-
sities of iron, carbon, and oxygen in the energy range 5–15
MeV n−1. The results are presented in Sect. 3.1. We then selected
Fe-rich days with a clearly higher Fe/(C+O) ratio than the aver-
age value measured for gradual solar particle events. From the
selected days we identiﬁed separate Fe-rich SEP events. These
results are discussed in Sect. 3.2. In Sect. 3.3 we present proper-
ties of the solar events associated with the identiﬁed SEP events.
Section 3.4 is devoted to a detailed study of the event-integrated

intensities of individual heavy elements during solar cycles 23
and 24.

3.1. Dailyintensities

Figures 2a and b show the daily average intensities of 5–
15 MeV n−1 Fe versus the daily average intensities of 5–15
MeV n−1 C and O, respectively. Solar cycle 23 is shown in red
and cycle 24 in blue; this coloring format is used throughout
the paper. In both ﬁgures, days with fewer than two detected
counts of either of the corresponding ion species are omitted.
In units of intensity, the two counts correspond to about 2.6 ·
10−6 cm−2sr−1s−1(MeVn−1)−1, 2.8·10−6 cm−2sr−1s−1(MeVn−1)−1
and 3.8 · 10−6 cm−2sr−1s−1(MeVn−1)−1 for C, O, and Fe, respec-
tively. The red and blue lines are linear ﬁts in log-log scales for
cycles 23 and 24. The slopes of the ﬁts are shown, as well as a
test statistic t calculated from the diﬀerence of the slopes. The
p-values in Figs. 2a and b are the results of the t-tests, represent-
ing the probabilities that the test statistic would be equal to or
higher than t if the samples were drawn randomly from a com-
mon distribution. The diﬀerence of slopes for cycles 23 and 24 is
statistically signiﬁcant within the 95% conﬁdence limit in both
Figs. 2a and b, which means that the cycles have been signiﬁ-
cantly diﬀerent considering these elements. Details on the ﬁtting
and the calculation of the test statistic are given in Appendix A.
The overall number of days with at least two counts of both ion
species in Fig. 2a is 502; 380 during solar cycle 23 and 122 dur-
ing solar cycle 24. These correspond to rates of 30.3 a−1 for cycle
23 (duration of 12.6 years) and 18.5 a−1 for cycle 24 (observed
duration of 6.6 years until the end of June 2015). In Fig. 2b the
number of days is 511; 390 during cycle 23 and 121 during cycle
24, corresponding to rates of 31.1 a−1 and 18.4 a−1 for cycles 23
and 24, respectively.

Figure 3a shows the cumulative distributions of daily aver-
age intensities of 5–15 MeV n−1 C (bottom panel), O (middle

panel), and Fe (top panel) for solar cycles 23 and 24. Again,
days with fewer than two counts of the corresponding ion species
are omitted. This omission does not aﬀect the shape of the dis-
tributions. All distributions were normalized to account for the
amount of time SOHO/ERNE has been oﬄine during the period
in consideration. In addition, the distributions of solar cycle 23
were divided by the ratio tS C23/tS C24, where tS C23 is the length
of solar cycle 23 and tS C24 is the length of solar cycle 24 up to
June 30, 2015. The distributions were ﬁt with double power-law
functions with the breakpoint as one of the ﬁtting parameters,
and the breakpoint intensities are given in the ﬁgure. It should be
noted that the data ranges used for the ﬁtting vary between the
ﬁts; the bump in the lowest intensities of O was omitted, as was
the drop in the highest intensities for all distributions except for
cycle 23 O. The distributions of cycle 24 decrease more quickly
than those of cycle 23 when the intensity increases, reﬂecting the
lower solar activity, that is, the smaller number of SEP events
with higher intensities. The diﬀerence of the logarithms of the
power-law breakpoints were tested with t-tests similarly to Fig.
2, and the probability values from the tests are shown in the ﬁg-
ure. The diﬀerence is signiﬁcant within the 95% conﬁdence limit
for all of the elements C, O, and Fe.

Figure 3b shows the distributions of daily average 5–15
MeV n−1 intensity ratios Fe/C (bottom panel), Fe/O (middle
panel), and Fe/(C+O) (top panel). The distributions were nor-
malized in the same way as the intensity distributions in Fig. 3a.
In each panel, a dashed line indicates the corresponding average
values in gradual events measured at 5-12 MeV n−1 (Reames
1995). The solid line in the top panel shows the value in gradual
events multiplied by two; this value is used as the criterion to
select Fe-rich events in Sect. 3.2. The distributions for solar cy-
cle 24 are signiﬁcantly lower than for cycle 23, mainly because
of the lower number of days with two or more counts of Fe. The
distributions reﬂect the bimodal shape reported in earlier surveys
(e.g., Reames 1988),that is, they indicate two distinct popula-

tions of particles. The peaks of the populations with the lower
values of Fe/O and Fe/(C+O) are close to the average gradual
values divided by two. The corresponding peak for Fe/C is close
to the gradual value divided by three. We explored the statisti-
cal validity of the observed two-peak structure by changing the
binning of the data and found that it is a persistent feature of the
distributions.

The daily averages in Fig. 3b suggest that cycle 23 was dom-
inated by gradual events, whereas the number of gradual and
impulsive events has been roughly equal during cycle 24. How-

ever, when we consider complete SEP events instead of just daily
averages, the impulsive event population is lacking in cycle 24.
This is discussed in more detail in Sect. 3.3. When we study
daily average values like in Fig. 3b, we need to bear in mind that
impulsive events have short durations, which meansthat more
than one impulsive event may occur during one day. Further-
more, large gradual events have durations of several days, thus
the same event may be sampled several times. Therefore the
daily averages cannot be used too literally to deduce information
about the number of actual SEP events, as the values attributed
to gradual events are grossly overrepresented.

3.2. Selectionofiron-richSEPevents

We wished to compare the two solar cycles with respect to the
properties of SEP events with enhanced abundances of heavy el-
ements, therefore we used the following two criteria to search
for Fe-rich events: 1) The daily counts of C, O and Fe must each
be two or more, and 2) the ratio of Fe/(C+O) must be higher
than 0.183, which is twice the corresponding value of gradual
solar particle events in the 5–12 MeV n−1 range as reported in
Reames (1995). There were 126 days that fulﬁlled the criteria,
96 of them during solar cycle 23 and 30 during cycle 24. Figure
4 shows the number of days with Fe-enhancement for each year
(green bars), with normalizations for the time SOHO/ERNE has
been oﬄine during each year (light green bars). The smoothed
monthly international sunspot number is shown for comparison.
The number of days with Fe-enhancement seems to roughly fol-
low the mean sunspot number (an indicator of the overall solar
activity), but there are also large deviations. For example, there
were fewer days with Fe-enhancement during 1999, 2001, 2003,
2012, and 2014 than would have been expected from the activity
level.

Fig. 5. Number (a) and proportion (b) of days with Fe/(C+O) > 0.183 during the rising and declining phases of solar cycles 23 and 24. The
normalizations in a) are similar as in Fig. 4.

Figure 5a shows the number of days with Fe-enhancement in
units of a−1 for the two cycles, divided into periods before and
after the cycle maximum, with similar normalizations as in Fig.
4. From this ﬁgure it is clear that the two solar cycles are diﬀerent
considering the heavy elements. The number of days per year
with Fe-enhanced solar activity during the declining phase of the
current cycle is about one third of what it was during the previous
cycle at the corresponding time, while during the rising phases
of the cycles the rates are roughly equal. In comparison, Fig.
5b shows the ratio of days with Fe-enhancement (Fe/(C+O) >
0.183) to all days with heavy ion activity (any value of Fe/(C+O)
with at least two counts of each species recorded per day) during
the rising and declining cycle phases. This ﬁgure shows that the
portion of days with Fe-enhanced activity has been considerably
smaller during the current cycle than in the previous cycle. It is
interesting to note that the rising phases of both the previous and
the current solar cycle had about twice as large a proportion of
days with Fe-enhanced activity than the declining phases, and
in this respect the cycles have been similar. The declining phase
of cycle 24 is still ongoing, and the situation is thus subject to
change with the detection or non-detection of Fe-enriched solar
activity.

To study complete SEP events instead of regarding each
day as a separate event, we made a visual scan of the
SOHO/ERNE proton data and used previous catalogs of SEP
events (Cane et al. 2010; Vainio et al. 2013) to associate the Fe-
enriched days with SEP events. In addition, we used the NOAA
GOES ﬂare database 3 and SOHO/LASCO CME catalog4 to ob-
tain ﬂare and CME associations for each event. In the end, we
identiﬁed 86 events with one or more days with Fe enrichment;
65 of them occurred during solar cycle 23 and 21 during cycle
24. The event list with full details is presented in Table 2.

The onset times for many of the events were taken from the
SEPServer catalog (Vainio et al. 2013), where the onset times
were determined with the Poisson-CUSUM-method described
in Huttunen-Heikinmaa et al. (2005) using 55–80 MeV protons.
After the publication of Vainio et al. (2013), the catalog5 has
been extended to cover the time period until the end of 2014.
As several small events were not seen in that energy range and

thus were not included in the catalog, we used the same method
but with 12.6–13.8 MeV protons to calculate the onset times.
The ending times of the events were deﬁned as when the one-
hour average 12.6–13.8 MeV proton intensity drops below ﬁve
times the background level, or in the cases of multiple succes-
sive events, one minute before the starting time of the following
event. During the observation period, the 12.6–13.8 MeV proton
background changed between ~1 · 10−4 cm−2sr−1s−1MeV−1 in
2002 and ~2 · 10−4 cm−2sr−1s−1MeV−1 in 2009. In some events
the intensity rises above ﬁve times the background for only a
short period of time or not at all; in these cases we used an event
duration of 12 hours.

The selection criteria mean that the events on the whole are
not necessarily Fe-rich, but they include at least one day with
Fe-enhancement. In some large events the Fe-enhancement oc-
curs only during the ﬁrst day of the event, for example in event
37 in Table 2 (4 November 2001), which lasted for over 12 days.
This event was also mentioned by Cane et al. (2003) as an ex-
ample of the type of event where the intensity-time proﬁles have
two peaks: one close to the time of the associated ﬂare, with rel-
atively high Fe/O and the other during the shock passage, with
low Fe/O. For some large, multi-day events, the Fe-enhancement
occurs later on in the event, for example in event 52 (22 October
2003), which was associated with an eastern (N03E17) M-class
ﬂare. In this event the proton intensities rise slowly, and peak
more than 24 hours after the onset, and the Fe-enhancement oc-
curs during and after the peak intensities. In some cases it is
also possible that the enhancement is caused by another smaller
Fe-rich event occurring simultaneously in the background of the
larger event, without causing a discernible rise in the proton in-
tensities.

3.3. PropertiesofassociatedﬂaresandCMEs

Figure 6 investigates the possible relationships between the
event-averaged 5–15 MeV n−1 Fe/C ratio and the properties of
the associated solar ﬂare and CME. There are diﬀerent numbers
of points in each panel because not all the solar event associ-
ations were found for all the events. Events with a statistical
uncertainty higher than 50% are excluded from Fig. 6 and the
following analysis. In this study we chose to use Fe/C instead
of the more commonly used Fe/O because C is more probably
fully ionized than O; therefore Fe and C have maximally diﬀer-

Fig. 6. Event-averaged 5–15 MeV n−1 Fe/C ratio versus longitude of the associated ﬂare (a), peak X-ray intensity of the associated ﬂare (b), speed
of the associated CME (c), and width of the associated CME (d). In each plot, the colors are similar as in Fig. 2. Values with statistical uncertainties
higher than 50% have been omitted.

ent Q/M values and their ratio is expected to exhibit the strongest
eﬀects of heavy ion enhancement.

Figure 6a presents the Fe/C ratio versus the longitude of the
associated ﬂare. Events of solar cycle 23 with the highest Fe/C
values are associated with ﬂares at longitudes with good mag-
netic connection to Earth, but this behavior is not observed for
events occurring during cycle 24. In fact, the two events with
the highest values of Fe/C of cycle 24 (events 73 and 75) are as-
sociated with ﬂares at N22E63 and S14W83, respectively, and
especially the ﬁrst is quite far from the well-connected region.
The mean longitudes and their standard deviations of the associ-
ated ﬂares are +40 ± 33 for cycle 23 and +21 ± 48 for cycle 24. It
is also important to note that all Fe/C values for cycle 24 in the
ﬁgure are below 1.2, whereas there are many events of cycle 23
with higher Fe/C values.

In Fig. 6b the Fe/C ratio is plotted versus the peak X-ray ﬂux.
Except for the lack of high values of Fe/C for cycle 24, there is
no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the cycles. The same applies
to Fig. 6c, where the Fe/C ratio is plotted against the speed of
the associated CME; both sets of events are distributed similarly.
Figure 6d shows the Fe/C ratio versus the width of the associ-
ated CME. Here the event populations are diﬀerent: 82% (14 out
of 17) of the CMEs of cycle 24 in the ﬁgure are halo CMEs,
compared with 50% for cycle 23. The mean CME widths and
standard deviations of the events occurring in cycles 23 and 24
are (243±126) degrees and (314±104) degrees, respectively. Re-
cently, Gopalswamy et al. (2014, 2015) compared the properties
of CMEs in cycles 23 and 24 and found that both the width of the
non-halo CMEs and the fraction of halo CMEs have been signif-
icantly higher during solar cycle 24 than during cycle 23. They

suggested that the anomalous widening of the CMEs in cycle 24
is a result of the diminished total pressure in the heliosphere.

3.4. Propertiesofheavyions

From Figs. 6a–d it is clear that there is a population with
Fe/C > 1 among the events of cycle 23 that is almost completely
lacking from the events of cycle 24. These events seem to be
associated with ﬂares with good magnetic connection and rel-
atively low X-ray peak ﬂux, and with relatively slow and nar-
row CMEs. These characteristics indicate that they are impul-
sive events. All but one of the events of cycle 23 in Fig. 6a with
Fe/C > 1 have rather short ﬂare durations (shorter than an hour),
giving further indication of the impulsive nature of these events,
which are absent during cycle 24.

Figure 7 shows the event-averaged 5–15 MeV n−1 intensities of
N, O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe plotted versus the event-
averaged 5–15 MeV n−1 intensity of C. Each panel is shown in a
similar format as in Fig. 2. As in Fig. 6, events with a statistical
uncertainty higher than 50% are excluded from this and the fol-
lowing ﬁgures and analyses. Linear ﬁts on log-log scales were
performed for the data. The statistical signiﬁcance of the diﬀer-
ences between the slopes of the ﬁts for cycles 23 and 24 were
tested with a t-test. At a 95% conﬁdence level the diﬀerences
were signiﬁcant for N, O, Mg, and Si, but not for other elements,
even though the diﬀerences were quite large for elements heavier
than Si. It should also be noted that even though the diﬀerences
are not statistically signiﬁcant separately, they are all in the same
direction, namely the slopes for cycle 24 are smaller for each ion

Fig. 8. Event-averaged ratios of 5–15 MeV n−1 N, O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe to C versus the event-integrated 5–15 MeV proton ﬂuence.
Each panel is shown in a similar format as in Fig. 7.

species. Thus, the probability is very low that all the diﬀerences,
although not all signiﬁcant separately at a 95% conﬁdence level,
occur by chance.

The relation between the proton ﬂuence and the relative
abundances of heavy ions is studied in Fig. 8. The ratios were
normalized to corresponding values in gradual events as reported
in Reames (1995). Proton ﬂuence is taken here as an indicator of
the event size. Figure 8 clearly shows that the ratio X/C decreases
as the event size increases and that the decrease is stronger for
heavier elements X. Even though the diﬀerence of slopes of the
ﬁts is statistically signiﬁcant for only N/C and S/C, the popula-
tions are clearly diﬀerent for Ne/C, Ar/C, Ca/C, and Fe/C. It is
also worth noting that the events with the lowest proton ﬂuences
seem to be lacking from cycle 24 populations, again indicating
the impulsive nature of the lacking events.

Figure 9 shows the event-averaged abundance ratios of C, N,
Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe to O versus the ratio of Fe to C.
Again, the ratios were normalized to gradual values. On average,
the slopes of the ﬁts become steeper when moving from C/O to-
wards Fe/O. Similar results of fractionation have been reported
before, for example, for X/C vs. Fe/C (Reames et al. 1994) at
1.9–2.8 MeV n−1 and for X/O vs. Fe/C (Mason et al. 2004) at
320–450 keV n−1. Events of cycle 23 do not exhibit this behav-
ior as regularly as events of cycle 24. Ne/O, with a steeper-than-
expected slope for both solar cycles, is an exception; it is also the
only case where the diﬀerence of slopes between the solar cy-
cles is statistically signiﬁcant. In addition, Fe/C values for cycle
23 seem to be evenly distributed in log(Fe/C), as also noted by
Mason et al. (2004) at lower energies. This is not true for Fe/C
values for cycle 24, most of which are found at about 1.5–4 times
the gradual value.

Fig. 9. Event-averaged ratios of 5–15 MeV n−1 C, N, Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe to O versus the event-averaged 5–15 MeV n−1 ratios of Fe to
C. Each panel is shown in a similar format as in Fig. 7.

Finally, Table 3 presents the unweighted mean abundances
of various ions (relative to C) in the Fe-rich events in this study
for all events (Col. 2) and separately for solar cycles 23 and 24
(Cols. 3 and 4, respectively). The uncertainties are calculated
as the standard error of the mean. Values for gradual events
(Reames 1995), large solar energetic particle (LSEP) events
(Desai et al. 2006), and quiet corona (Feldman & Widing 2003)
are given as a comparison. This table shows that the mean abun-
dances of the heavy ions from O to Fe in the Fe-rich events of
cycle 24 are signiﬁcantly lower than in cycle 23. For example,
the average abundance of Fe in the Fe-rich events of cycle 24 is
less than half of what it was in cycle 23. Still, compared to grad-
ual events or the coronal values, the abundance of Fe in cycle
24 was clearly enhanced. The mean abundances of all Fe-rich
events in this survey were between the values of gradual events
and LSEP events at least to within the error limits, except for

Ne, which had a higher value than either of the compared popu-
lations.

4. Summary and conclusions

We surveyed the heavy ion data measured by SOHO/ERNE from
the beginning of solar cycle 23 until the end of June 2015, that
is, well beyond the maximum of solar cycle 24. The long obser-
vation period allowed us to study and compare the properties of
heavy ions in SEP events during the two solar cycles. We used
the energy range of 5–15 MeV n−1 and were restricted to average
daily intensities of 2.6 · 10−6 cm−2sr−1s−1(MeVn−1)−1, 2.8 · 10−6
cm−2sr−1s−1(MeVn−1)−1 and 3.8 · 10−6 cm−2sr−1s−1(MeVn−1)−1
for carbon, oxygen, and iron, respectively. These intensities cor-
respond to two or more counts per day recorded by the instru-
ment in the energy range 5–15 MeV n−1.

The number of days per year averaged over solar cycle with
C, O, and Fe intensities above the thresholds given above were
signiﬁcantly higher (by a factor of ≥ 1.6) during cycle 23 than
in cycle 24. When presenting the Fe intensities as functions of
C or O intensities, the populations in cycles 23 and 24 behaved
diﬀerently. During cycle 23, much higher C, O, and in particular
Fe daily average intensities were recorded than in cycle 24 (Fig.
2). Linear ﬁts in log-log scales of Fe intensity as a function of C
or O intensity gave steeper slopes (at 95% conﬁdence levels) for
cycle 23 than for cycle 24. These results were the ﬁrst indications
of the reduced eﬃciency of solar particle acceleration in cycle
24.

The normalized number of days for carbon and oxygen at
low cumulative daily average intensities were approximately
equal during cycles 23 and 24, but days with higher intensities
(≥ 10−3 cm−2sr−1s−1(MeVn−1)−1) occurred much less frequently
during cycle 24 (Fig. 3). The diﬀerence for Fe between the cy-
cles was clear at all intensities, with a lower normalized number
of days in cycle 24. When ﬁtting the distributions with double
power laws, the breakpoints for all three elements were at lower
intensities during cycle 24 and the distributions in cycle 23 ex-
tended to considerably higher maximum intensities. The latter
was particularly true for iron. The fewer days with high C and O
intensities in cycle 24 again indicate a weaker overall accelera-
tion eﬃciency of SEPs. The complete absence of days with high
Fe intensities (≥ 8 · 10−3 cm−2sr−1s−1(MeVn−1)−1) seems to im-
ply that the processes responsible for impulsive acceleration in
particular are weaker during cycle 24. The bimodal distributions
of Fe/(C+O) and Fe/O ratios show, however, that there are days
with both gradual and impulsive SEP events during cycle 24 as
well, although fewer than in cycle 23.

The number of Fe-enhanced days, deﬁned as Fe/(C+O) >
0.183, was much higher during cycle 23 and there was a clear
diﬀerence between the rising and declining phases of the two
cycles, with the largest number of Fe-enhanced days in the de-
clining phase of cycle 23 (Fig. 5a). When calculating the portion
of Fe-enhanced days from all days with C, O, and Fe intensities
above the thresholds (i.e., with any value of the Fe/(C+O) ratio
and with at least two counts of each species recorded per day),
both cycles had about twice as large portions of Fe-enhanced
days in the rising phase than in the declining phase. Thus, al-
though during the declining phase of cycle 23 there was a sig-
niﬁcantly larger number of days with C, O, and Fe detected than
the rising phase, relatively few of these were Fe-enhanced. From
comparing the cycles, we found the portions of Fe-enhanced

Article number, page 10 of 14

days in both rising and declining phases of cycle 23 to be about
twice larger than during cycle 24 at corresponding times (Fig.
5b). This may be due to the signiﬁcantly lower number of M-
and X-class ﬂares in cycle 24.

When identifying complete SEP events instead of individual
days, 86 SEP events with Fe enrichment were found (Table 2).
Of these, 65 occurred in cycle 23 and 21 in cycle 24. For the
identiﬁed Fe-rich SEP events, we investigated the dependence
of the Fe/C ratios on the ﬂare longitude, X-ray ﬂare peak ﬂux,
CME speed, and CME width (Fig. 6). While the events of cycle
23 with highest Fe/C ratios were associated with ﬂares at western
longitudes, this was not observed during cycle 24, which had a
much ﬂatter ﬂare longitude distribution. In this respect, cycle 23
events obeyed the expected behavior of Fe-rich impulsive SEP
events originating from magnetically well-connected regions. In
cycle 24, however, particles of Fe-rich events seem to have had
easier access from distant longitudes to ﬁeld lines connecting to
Earth. No diﬀerences were observed between the cycles in the
Fe/C ratio dependence on X-ray ﬂare peak ﬂux or CME speed.
With respect to the CME widths, the SEP populations of the two
cycles were diﬀerent. In cycle 24, 82% of the Fe-rich SEP events
for which a CME association was found were associated with
halo CMEs. The corresponding portion in cycle 23 was only
50%. This may be related to the generally more frequent appear-
ance of halo CMEs during cycle 24, presumably because of the
diminished total pressure in the heliosphere (Gopalswamy et al.
2015). Associations of eastern Fe-rich events with rapidly ex-
panding CMEs may also explain the access of particles to ﬁeld
lines connecting to Earth.

The population of events with Fe/C > 1, which was present
during cycle 23, was completely lacking during cycle 24 (Fig. 6).
The characteristics of these events during cycle 23 implied that
they were impulsive events. The absence of these events in cycle
24 may be due to a reduced particle acceleration eﬃciency or to
a diﬀerent or less abundant seed particle populations. The latter
may be related to a decrease in the eﬃciency of plasma fraction-
ation processes due to low level of solar activity (Landi & Testa
2015).

The behavior of intensities of N, O, Mg, and Si vs. the inten-
sity of C was found to be diﬀerent during cycles 23 and 24. With
95% conﬁdence levels, the slopes of the log-log ﬁts for these el-
ements were steeper during cycle 23 (Fig. 7). This is caused by
the presence of large SEP events with high intensities of various
elements in cycle 23, which were not present in cycle 24. This
indicates a lower eﬃciency in the shock acceleration in cycle 24

O. Raukunen et al.: Iron-rich solar particle events during two solar cycles

that might be due to reduced turbulence in the low corona and in
interplanetary space.

With increasing proton ﬂuences of the events, the event-
averaged X/C ratios were decreasing, and the decrease was
stronger for heavier elements (Fig. 8). No systematic statistically
signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the cycles was found, therefore
we cannot reliably estimate whether there has been a change be-
tween the cycles in the eﬃciency of an A/Q-dependent acceler-
ation process, for instance. For several elements, however, the
populations during the two cycles were clearly diﬀerent, and the
events with the lowest proton ﬂuences were lacking from the cy-
cle 24 populations.

The event-averaged abundance ratios of X/O vs. Fe/C were
found to generally increase and the slopes of the linear ﬁts in
log-log scales became steeper when moving from C/O toward
Fe/O (Fig. 9). This was true for both cycles, and there was no
statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the slopes between the cy-
cles, excluding Ne/O, which had a steeper slope during cycle 23,
and had a steeper slope than expected from the systematics of
the other elements during cycle 24 as well. The values of Fe/C
during cycle 23 were evenly distributed on a logarithmic scale,
while during cycle 24 the ratio distribution was more restricted
closer to the coronal value.

The mean abundances of heavy ions from O to Fe in Fe-rich
SEP events were found to be signiﬁcantly lower for cycle 24
than for cycle 23 (Table 3). Compared to gradual SEP events or
to coronal values, however, the abundance of Fe in these events
was found to be clearly enhanced even during cycle 24.

Overall, we found that the properties of heavy ions in so-
lar energetic particle events reﬂect the reduced solar activity and
possibly the weaker magnetic ﬁeld strength during solar cycle
24. There were fewer solar particle events with Fe intensities ex-
ceeding our threshold value in the energy range 5–15 MeV n−1
during solar cycle 24 than during cycle 23. Furthermore, in gen-
eral the average heavy ion abundances of cycle 24 events were
lower than during cycle 23. Our results indicate lower eﬃcien-
cies of solar particle acceleration processes in both large SEP
events and weaker impulsive events during cycle 24 and possibly
diﬀerences in the composition and abundance of seed particles
between the two cycles.

Appendix A: Statistical testing of the linear ﬁts

The linear ﬁts in this paper were calculated with the procedure
fitexy for Interactive Data Language (IDL). The procedure is
a part of the widely used IDL Astronomy User’s Library6. The
procedure calculates a linear least-squares approximation taking
into account errors in both variables, σx and σy, by minimizing
the quantity

χ2 =

N−1

X

i=0

(yi − a − bxi)2
yi + b2σ2
σ2
xi

,

(A.1)

where a is the intercept and b the slope of the resulting ﬁt. In ad-
dition to χ2, a, and b, the procedure calculates the error estimates
σa and σb for the ﬁt parameters.

We wish to test whether the diﬀerence of two slopes of lin-
ear ﬁts is statistically signiﬁcant. This can be achieved using the
Student t-test with the statistic

t =

b1 − b2
qσ2

b1

+ σ2
b2

,

(A.2)

where b1 and b2 are the slopes of the two ﬁts and σb1 and σb2
their errors. When the scatter of the data is large compared to
the error limits of the data points, the ﬁt is ”poor”, that is, χ2 is
large, although a linear model can still be the correct model. In
this case, the error estimates of the ﬁt parameters are not mean-
ingful. To achieve a ”good” ﬁt and meaningful parameter error
estimates, the error limits in both x and y directions are enlarged
by multiplying them with such a number that the ﬁtting proce-
dure yields a reduced chi-square χ2
red = 1. Equation A.1 shows
that the multiplying factor is equal to the square root of the re-
duced chi-square of the ﬁt with the original error estimates. This
method was used for all of the statistical testing of ﬁt parameters
in this paper.
