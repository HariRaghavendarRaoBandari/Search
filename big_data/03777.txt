ABSTRACT

We present results from spectral ﬁtting of the very high state of GX 339-4 with NuSTAR and Swift. We use
relativistic reﬂection modeling to measure the spin of the black hole and inclination of the inner disk, and ﬁnd
a spin of a = 0.95+0.02−0.08 and inclination of 30°±1 (statistical errors). These values agree well with previous
results from reﬂection modelling. With the exceptional sensitivity of NuSTAR at the high-energy side of the
disk spectrum, we are able to constrain multiple physical parameters simultaneously using continuum ﬁtting.
By using the constraints from reﬂection as input for the continuum ﬁtting method, we invert the conventional
ﬁtting procedure to estimate the mass and distance of GX 339-4 using just the X-ray spectrum, ﬁnding a mass
of 9.0+1.6−1.2M(cid:12) and distance of 8.4 ± 0.9 kpc (statistical errors).

1. INTRODUCTION

There are two methods of determining the dimensionless
black hole spin parameter, a, in X-ray binaries. The ﬁrst re-
lies on measuring the relativistic distortion of the iron Kα line,
originating in reﬂection from the inner accretion disk (Fabian
et al. 1989). The second uses the spectrum of the disk it-
self, which is strongly dependent on the inner radius (Zhang,
Cui & Chen 1997). Both methods have been used success-
fully in several X-ray binaries (see reviews by McClintock,
Narayan & Steiner 2014; Miller & Miller 2015; Middleton
2015), however the results are not always consistent between
the two (Kolehmainen, Done & D´ıaz Trigo 2014). Some of
this discrepancy can be attributed to the difﬁculty of using
both methods simultaneously, because they rely on being able
to measure different spectral components. The optimal state
for measuring the iron line may not be optimal for measuring
the disk spectrum, and vice versa. A second difﬁculty arises
from pile-up, which can potentially introduce large uncertain-
ties, the extent of which are difﬁcult to establish, and can lead
to conﬂicting results (e.g. Ng et al. 2010; Miller et al. 2010).
The launch of the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array
(NuSTAR; Harrison et al. 2013) has revolutionized the study

of reﬂection in X-ray binaries. NuSTAR has a triggered read-
out, meaning that it does not suffer from pile-up when look-
ing at bright sources (pile-up occurs when two or more pho-
tons arrive close together and are read as a single event).
NuSTAR thus allows for reliable, sensitive, low background
spectroscopy from 3–79 keV, covering both the iron line and
Compton hump from X-ray reﬂection. This has enabled preci-
sion measurements of the reﬂection parameters in several X-
ray binaries (Miller et al. 2013b,a; Tomsick et al. 2014; King
et al. 2014; Fuerst et al. 2015; Parker et al. 2015).

GX 339-4 is a well known transient X-ray binary. It was
discovered in 1973 by Markert et al. (1973), who noted that
it changed by a factor of (cid:38) 60 in ﬂux over a year.
It has
since been studied extensively, as it is a very bright source
and frequently undergoes outbursts. There have been sev-
eral attempts to measure the spin in GX 339-4. Miller et al.
(2004a,b) used XMM-Newton and RXTE, and the Chandra
HETGS, to measure a relativistically broadened iron line.
From the XMM-Newton/RXTE spectrum Miller et al. (2004a)
argue for a high spin of a > 0.8–0.9. Reis et al. (2008) re-
analysed the archival XMM-Newton and RXTE data using new
reﬂection models, and ﬁnd a spin of a = 0.935± 0.01. Miller
et al. (2008) combine measurements with Suzaku and XMM-
Newton to ﬁnd a best estimate of a = 0.94 ± 0.01 (statisti-
cal) ±0.04 (systematic), in good agreement with the measure-
ment of Reis et al. (2008). Yamada et al. (2009) use the same
Suzaku data as Miller et al. (2008), excising more of the core
of the PSF to further limit the effects of pile-up, and ﬁnd that
the line appears narrower when more data are excluded. From
this, they infer that the broadening of the line is due to pile-
up, and that GX 339-4 need not be rapidly spinning (although
their measurements are still consistent with maximal spin at
the 90% conﬁdence level). Kolehmainen & Done (2010) use
continuum ﬁtting and physical arguments based on the incli-
nation and distance of the binary system to argue that the spin
must be less than 0.9. Most recently, Ludlam, Miller & Cack-
ett (2015) re-analyse the data from Miller et al. (2004a) and
Miller et al. (2008) and ﬁnd a > 0.97, and Garc´ıa et al. (2015)
ﬁnd a = 0.93+0.03−0.05 from stacked RXTE data.

The inclination of the GX 339-4 binary system is only

2

PARKER ET AL.

weakly constrained by dynamic measurements. As the system
is non-eclipsing, the inclination must be less than 60° (Cow-
ley et al. 2002), and a plausible lower limit of i (cid:38) 45° is given
from the mass function (Zdziarski et al. 2004). However, mea-
surements of the inner disk inclination from the broad iron
line generally give lower values. Miller et al. (2004a) ﬁnd
i = 12°+4−2; Miller et al. (2008) ﬁnd i = 19°±1; and Reis
et al. (2008) ﬁnd i = 18.2°+0.3−0.5. Cassatella et al. (2012) use
a combined spectroscopy and timing analysis to ﬁnd i < 30°,
ﬁtting both the lag and spectral data. More recently, Fuerst
et al. (2015) used ﬁve hard state observations from the failed
outburst in 2013 to constrain the reﬂection spectrum, ﬁnd-
ing inclinations ranging from 31° to 59°, depending on the
model. Ludlam, Miller & Cackett (2015) ﬁnd an inclination
of 36°±4° using the latest RELXILL reﬂection models (Garc´ıa
et al. 2014), which self-consistently take into account the in-
clination angle. Garc´ıa et al. (2015) also use RELXILL, com-
bined with extremely high signal but low resolution stacked
RXTE spectra, to ﬁnd an inclination of 48°±1.

In this paper we use broad-band spectroscopy with Swift
and NuSTAR to constrain the spin and inclination using rela-
tivistic reﬂection. We then use these estimates as input for the
continuum ﬁtting model, and ﬁt for the mass and distance, ob-
taining a constraint on these parameters using just the X-ray
spectrum.

2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION

Swift monitoring detected strong thermal and power-law
components in the spectrum of GX 339-4 on 2015 March 4th,
suggesting that both reﬂection and continuum ﬁtting methods
could be used simultaneously. This state is frequently referred
to as the very high state (or steep power-law state; see re-
view by McClintock & Remillard 2006). A NuSTAR target of
opportunity (TOO) was triggered, with a simultaneous Swift
snapshot, for clean on-source exposures of ∼ 2 and 30 ks,
respectively.

The Swift/XRT data were processed with standard proce-
dures (xrtpipeline v0.13.1), ﬁltering and screening crite-
ria using FTOOLS (v6.16). The data, collected in windowed-
timing mode, were affected by pileup. Following Romano
et al. (2006), source events were accumulated within an annu-
lar region with an outer radius of 20 pixels (1 pixel ∼ 2.(cid:48)(cid:48)36)
and inner radius of 10 pixels. Background events were ac-
cumulated from a source-free region nearby. For our spec-
tral analysis, ancillary response ﬁles were generated with
xrtmkarf. We used the XRT spectral redistribution matri-
ces in CALDB (20140709). We bin the spectrum to a signal-
to-noise ratio of 30, after background subtraction, and ﬁt from
1–4 keV.

The NuSTAR data (ObsID 80001015003) were reduced us-
ing NuSTAR Data Analysis Software (NuSTARDAS) 1.4.1
and CALDB version 20150316. Source spectra were ex-
tracted from 150(cid:48)(cid:48) circular extraction regions centered on the
source position, and background spectra were extracted from
∼ 100(cid:48)(cid:48) circular regions from the opposite corner of the detec-
tor (the least contaminated with source photons). The source
count rate is a factor of 10 or more above the background at
all energies. We bin the NuSTAR FPMA and FPMB spectra
to oversample the spectrum by a factor of 3, and to a signal-
to-noise ratio of 50. We ﬁt the spectra over the whole energy
range (3–79 keV); however, the ﬁnal spectral bin is extremely
large due to the steep spectrum and extends past 79 keV, so we
exclude it. This gives an effective upper limit of ∼ 60 keV.

abundances (Wilms, Allen & McCray 2000), and vern cross-
sections (Verner et al. 1996).

3. RESULTS

In Fig. 1 we show the residuals to an absorbed power-
law/disk black body spectrum (tbabs*[diskbb+powerlaw] in
XSPEC). The broad iron line and Compton hump are clearly
visible, and there is a prominent excess below ∼ 3 keV where
the simple phenomenological model does not adequately de-
scribe the data.

We ﬁt the combined NuSTAR/XRT spectrum with a three-
component disk plus Comptonization plus reﬂection model.
We use kerrbb (Li et al. 2005) for the disk spectrum, comptt
(Titarchuk 1994) for the Comptonization, and relxilllp (Garc´ıa
et al. 2014) for the relativistic reﬂection. As discussed in
Parker et al. (2015), the relxilllp lamp-post model has the ad-
vantage of parameterising the emissivity proﬁle in physical
units, requiring a smaller number of parameters, and restrict-
ing the proﬁle to physically plausible regions of parameter
space. In addition, we allow the photon index of the reﬂection
spectrum to vary independently of the continuum, as required
in Fuerst et al. (2015). We tie the high energy cutoff of the re-
ﬂection spectrum to twice the plasma temperature of comptt
(Petrucci et al. 2001). We tie the spin and inclination parame-
ters of the disk and reﬂection components together, but leave
the mass and distance parameters of kerrbb free to vary, as
these are largely unconstrained (see e.g. Hynes et al. 2003).
This differs from the conventional continuum ﬁtting proce-
dure, where the mass, distance, and inclination parameters
are ﬁxed and used to constrain the spin. The relxilllp model
has a parameter for the reﬂection fraction, which allows for a
powerlaw continuum. As we already include a Comptoniza-
tion continuum we ﬁx this parameter to -1, i.e. no continuum
emission. We leave the color-correction factor at the default
value of 1.7. Finally, we allow for a constant offset between
the three instruments, to account for differences in ﬂux cali-

bration, and allow for a slight difference in Γ between FPMA
and FPMB (this is a <1% effect, within the known calibration
uncertainties; Madsen et al. 2015).

This model gives a reasonable ﬁt to the data (χ2

ν = 1.32),
given the multiple instruments/detectors and extremely high
count rate, and no signiﬁcant residuals are visible. The best ﬁt
parameters are given in Table 1, and the model and residuals
are shown in Fig. 2. The mass and distance parameters are
well constrained, as are the spin and inclination.

As in Parker et al. (2015), we use the XSPEC EMCEE
(written by Jeremy Sanders) implementation of the EMCEE
MCMC code (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013) to calculate con-
ﬁdence contours for the model parameters and search for de-
generacies. We use 500 walkers for 10000 steps each, with an
initial burn-in period of 1000 steps14. We show these contours
for selected parameters of interest in Fig. 3.

We also perform a second ﬁt, designed to establish the spin
and inclination estimates from continuum ﬁtting as a func-
tion of mass and distance. Distance estimates range from
∼6–15 kpc, and mass estimates cover the same range in solar
masses. We therefore ﬁt our model at every integer pair of M
and D values within this range (the spin, inclination, and χ2
values are shown in Fig. 4). The ﬁt remains good over most of
the parameter space, and we ﬁnd a band of solutions that are
consistent with the reﬂection estimates of i and a, with large
deviations in the high M, low D and low M, high D corners.

4. DISCUSSION

The data used in this work is some of the highest quality
ever taken of GX 339-4, with higher spectral resolution than
RXTE, and none of the issues arising from pile-up that af-
fect XMM-Newton and Chandra. We ﬁnd a high spin value
(a = 0.95+0.02−0.08) and a low inclination (30°±1) from reﬂec-
tion ﬁtting. These values are in good agreement with pre-
14 The autocorellation time is ∼ 100 steps. The 1000 step burn-in time
thus covers ∼ 10 autocorellation times, sufﬁcient given the large number of
walkers. The effective sample size is then ∼ 50000.

Note. Errors are statistical only, and are calculated for each parameter from
the MCMC after marginalising over all other parameters.

vious measurements of the spin from relativistic reﬂection,
particularly those of Reis et al. (2008), Miller et al. (2008),
and Garc´ıa et al. (2015), all of whom found a ∼ 0.94. The
consensus now ﬁrmly points towards a high spin (a > 0.9),
particularly with NuSTAR measurements where the observed
broadening cannot be due to pile-up effects. The a < 0.9 re-
sult of Kolehmainen & Done (2010) relies on the inclination
of the inner disk being the same as that of the binary system,
which may not be the case. Our measurement of the incli-
nation is consistent with the majority of other recent results
from reﬂection ﬁtting (e.g. Plant, O’Brien & Fender 2014;
Ludlam, Miller & Cackett 2015), although notably lower than
that found by Garc´ıa et al. (2015). This difference may be
due to the lower spectral resolution of the data used, but more
work is needed to determine the true inclination of the inner
disk in GX 339-4.

By combining the reﬂection and continuum ﬁtting meth-
ods, we have been able to constrain the mass and distance
of GX 339-4 using just the X-ray spectrum. The mass and
distance are strongly correlated (see Fig. 4), but not so de-
generate that a meaningful constraint cannot be obtained. We
are able to constrain multiple parameters (either M and D or
a and i) using continuum ﬁtting because of the exceptional
quality of the NuSTAR data covering the high energy side of
the disk spectrum. The kerrbb model is signiﬁcantly con-
tributing ﬂux in the NuSTAR band up to 10 keV, and domi-
nates the emission until ∼ 5 keV. The 3–10 keV band is both
where NuSTAR is most sensitive and where the disk spectrum
shows the greatest sensitivity to parameter changes, as it orig-
inates from the inner disk, so NuSTAR allows us to measure
multiple parameters with precision.

There are various systematic effects that may impact both
the reﬂection and continuum ﬁtting methods. We have as-
sumed a colour-correction factor of 1.7 for kerrbb. We test
two additional values, f=1.5 and 1.9 (e.g. Davis & Hubeny
2006), and ﬁnd masses of 7.8+0.7−0.1 M(cid:12) and 11.3+0.5−0.2 M(cid:12),
respectively, and distances of 7.2+0.2−0.1 kpc and 8.2+0.7−0.2 kpc.
This represents a systematic error of ∼1–2 M(cid:12) in mass and

∼ 1 kpc in distance. The continuum method is only valid
when the source is accreting below ∼ 30% of the Edding-
ton limit. Due to the uncertainty in M and D, this is hard to
be certain of, but based on the X-ray luminosity we ﬁnd that
this condition is met when M/M(cid:12) > 0.06(D/1kpc)2. This
condition is met for the majority of the parameter space con-
cerned (including the estimate of Zdziarski et al. 2004, and
our estimate, see Fig. 4). Additionally, the continuum ﬁtting
method is only valid when the fraction of disk photons that
are Compton scattered is (cid:46) 0.25 (Steiner et al. 2009). In this
case, the fraction is ∼ 0.15, and is not affected by mass or
distance.

We rely heavily on measurements of the spectral shape of
the disk at high energies with NuSTAR to constrain multiple
parameters from continuum ﬁtting. While the sensitivity of
NuSTAR means that the disk is detectable up to ∼ 10 keV, the
fraction of ﬂux it contributes is low above 5 keV due to the
steep spectral shape. This means that small differences in the
dominant Comptonization component can potentially have a
large impact on the measured parameters. To test this, we re-
ﬁt the data in the same way using the alternative Comptoniza-
tion models nthcomp (Zycki et al. 1999), compps (Poutanen
& Svensson 1996), and eqpair (Coppi 1999). We ﬁnd masses
of 9.8±0.2 M(cid:12), 11.2+0.7−0.2 M(cid:12), and 8.8+0.5−0.4 M(cid:12), respectively,
and distances of 8.3+0.4−0.3 kpc, 9.7+0.9−0.1 kpc, and 8.8+0.3−0.2 kpc15.
Taking the standard deviation of these measurements (includ-
ing the original with comptt) as an estimate of the systematic
error gives ±1.1 M(cid:12) in mass and ±0.6 kpc in distance.
A ﬁnal systematic issue affecting the continuum method is
conserving the number of Compton scattered photons from
the disk. We are unable to ﬁnd an acceptable ﬁt using the
simpl model (Steiner et al. 2009), due to its lack of spectral
curvature needed for the NuSTAR spectrum. In one case out
of six considered by Steiner et al., comptt underpredicts the
inner radius of the disk by 0.5 RG relative to simpl. Trans-
lating this to spin (at the best ﬁt value from reﬂection) gives
a conservative systematic error of 0.95+0.04−0.07, which is com-
parable to the statistical error on spin and therefore will not
have a large effect on our results. In general, the choice of
hard component model may have a systematic effect on the
results from continuum modelling, particularly with NuSTAR
data where much of the signal is at high energies.
We conﬁrm the difference in Γ between the reﬂection and
continuum spectra found by Fuerst et al. (2015), ﬁnding Γ ∼
2.1 for the reﬂection and ∼ 2.4 for the continuum (calcu-
lated by replacing the Comptonized continuum with a cut-off
power-law, and ignoring the data below 3 keV where comptt
turns over and cannot be replicated with a power-law). These
measurements are inconsistent at > 3σ, and the difference
is similar in size to that found by Fuerst et al. (2015). We
are unable to ﬁnd a good ﬁt when Γ is ﬁxed between the two
spectral components. There are several potential reasons for
this, but perhaps the most likely is systematic effects in the
reﬂection modelling. There are several secondary effects that
could affect the broad-band shape of the reﬂection spectrum,
altering Γ, the iron abundance, and cut-off energy. The as-
sumed density of the latest generation of reﬂection models is
1015 cm−3, which is appropriate for AGN but should be or-
ders of magnitude larger in XRBs. Standard reﬂection models
do not include a variable low energy cut-off, and so overpre-

culated using the XSPEC error algorithm, rather than MCMC, which is likely
why they are smaller than those reported in Table 1.

dict the ﬂux at low energies, which may cause the slope to
become harder to compensate. A further point to consider is
the impact of the thermal emission from the disk on the total
reﬂection spectrum. There have been models which include
this in the past (Ross & Fabian 2007), but these include the
contribution from the black body in the reﬂection spectrum,
so are unsuitable for use with KERRBB. We cannot say deﬁni-
tively whether the difference in Γ is real or due to systematic
effects, but it should be possible to determine with more so-
phisticated modelling. We do not expect any of these effects
to strongly impact the shape of the line proﬁle, so our results
on the spin and inclination should be robust. If the difference
in Γ is real, it is likely due to the geometry of the corona. In
particular, outﬂowing coronal models predict that different Γ
values would be seen by the disk and observers at inﬁnity (e.g.
Beloborodov 1999).

5. CONCLUSIONS

We present observations of the transient X-ray binary
GX 339-4 in the very high state, using NuSTAR and Swift.
With the high sensitivity and lack of pile-up available with
NuSTAR, combined with the broad-band spectrum made pos-
sible by the addition of the Swift XRT, we are able to use
both reﬂection and continuum ﬁtting methods to ﬁnd mea-
surements of several key parameters. All errors below are
statistical only.

• Using reﬂection ﬁtting, we ﬁnd a high spin (a =
0.95+0.02−0.08) and low inclination (i = 30°±1), which
agree well with previous measurements using reﬂec-
tion.

• By combining the reﬂection and continuum ﬁtting
methods we are able to estimate the mass and distance
of GX 339-4 using the X-ray spectrum alone, ﬁnding a
mass of 9.0+1.6−1.2M(cid:12) and distance of 8.4 ± 0.9 kpc.
• We explore the effect of mass and distance on the esti-
mates of a and i from continuum ﬁtting, ﬁnding a band
of solutions consistent with the results from reﬂection.

• We conﬁrm the result of Fuerst et al. (2015) that a dif-
ferent value of Γ between the reﬂection and continuum
spectra is required, at a high level of signiﬁcance.
