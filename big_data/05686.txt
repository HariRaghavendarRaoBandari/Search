Abstract

Dispersive eﬀects from strong ππ rescattering in the ﬁnal state (FSI) of weak
K → ππ decays are revisited with the goal to have a global view on their relative
importance for the ∆I = 1/2 rule and the ratio ε(cid:48)/ε in the Standard Model (SM).
We point out that this goal cannot be reached within a pure eﬀective (meson) ﬁeld
approach like chiral perturbation theory in which the dominant current-current op-
erators governing the ∆I = 1/2 rule and the dominant density-density (four-quark)
operators governing ε(cid:48)/ε cannot be disentangled from each other. But in the context
of a dual QCD approach, which includes both long distance dynamics and the UV
completion, that is QCD at short distance scales, such a distinction is possible. We
ﬁnd then that beyond the strict large N limit, N being the number of colours, FSI
are likely to be important for the ∆I = 1/2 rule but much less relevant for ε(cid:48)/ε. The
latter ﬁnding diminishes signiﬁcantly hopes that improved treatment of FSI within
lattice QCD approach and dual QCD approach would bring the SM prediction for
ε(cid:48)/ε to agree with the experimental data, opening thereby an arena for important
new physics contributions to this ratio.

Introduction

1
Among the most important observables in ﬂavour physics are the ratio of K → ππ
isospin amplitudes ReA0/ReA2 and ε(cid:48)/ε. The ﬁrst ratio

= 22.4 ,

(1)

expresses the so-called ∆I = 1/2 rule [1, 2] in K → ππ decays. On the other hand
ε(cid:48)/ε measured by NA48 [3] and KTeV [4, 5] collaborations, to be

(ε(cid:48)/ε)exp = (16.6 ± 2.3) × 10−4 ,

(2)
expresses CP-violation in K → ππ decays. In the Standard Model (SM) the ampli-
tudes ReA0,2 are mostly governed by the Q1,2 current-current operators and ε(cid:48)/ε by
the QCD penguin Q6 and electroweak penguin Q8 density-density operators. The
most recent result for the ∆I = 1/2 rule from the dual approach to QCD reads [6]

while the corresponding result from the RBC-UKQCD collaboration is [7]

Both results signal that ReA0 is strongly enhanced over ReA2 but there is a visible
deﬁcit in (3) when compared with (1), while the ﬁrst lattice QCD result is still
rather uncertain.
Concerning ε(cid:48)/ε, the most recent result based on the hadronic matrix elements of
QCD and electroweak penguin operators from RBC-UKQCD lattice collaboration
[7, 8] reads [9]

ε(cid:48)/ε = (1.9 ± 4.5) × 10−4 ,

while the upper bounds on the hadronic matrix elements of penguin operators from
dual approach to QCD [10] imply

(ε(cid:48)/ε)SM = (8.6 ± 3.2) × 10−4 .

(6)
Both results for ε(cid:48)/ε were derived by assuming the ∆I = 1/2 rule in (1). Yet,
they diﬀer signiﬁcantly from (2), suggesting some evidence for the presence of new
physics (NP) in K decays.

But the lattice QCD approach as well as the dual QCD approach do not yet
properly include ﬁnal state interactions (FSI), and the question arises whether these
eﬀects could improve the status of ∆I = 1/2 rule and of ε(cid:48)/ε bringing the theory
in both cases closer to data. In fact the chiral perturbation theory practitioners,
already long time ago, put forward the idea that both the amplitude ReA0, governed
by the current-current operator Q2 − Q1 and the Q6 contribution to the ratio ε(cid:48)/ε
could be enhanced signiﬁcantly through FSI in a correlated manner [11–15]. The
goal of this letter is to investigate whether this claim is really justiﬁed.

Before entering the details, let us make the following important observation
that underlines the main points made in our paper. The QCD penguin operator

2 Weak hadronic matrix elements

Q6, generated by short-distance (SD) evolution from MW down to scales O(1 GeV)
of the current-current four-quark operator Q2−Q1, is unambiguously identiﬁed as a
density-density four-quark operator [6]. However such a distinction between Q2−Q1
and Q6 is not so evident during the further long-distance (LD) evolution below the
critical 1 GeV scale of QCD, though mandatory to consistently identify the strong
FSI eﬀects on the corresponding weak hadronic matrix elements.

2 Weak hadronic matrix elements

In a chiral perturbation approach based on the power counting in meson momenta,
the weak K decay amplitude for the dominant ∆I = 1/2 channel reads [16]

at O(p2)

A0 = (cid:104)ππ(I = 0)| G8[∂µU ∂µU +]ds |K(cid:105) ,
(7)
R) under global U (3)L ⊗ U (3)R
with U (π), a unitary matrix transforming as (3L, 3∗
transformations. Consequently, in this phenomenological approach the four-quark
operators (Q2 − Q1) and Q6 contributing to A0 are somehow merged into a sin-
gle octet one, at least in the isospin limit [17]. As a result, the corresponding
current-current operator cannot be disentangled any more from the density-density
operator. In the absence of any UV completion for this eﬀective theory, their respec-
tive contributions to the A0 decay amplitude (7) are encoded in the unique complex
coupling G8. Remarkably, this apparent merging of a priori quite diﬀerent O(p2)
operators can be seen at work once fundamental properties of QCD are eventually
taken into account.

First of all, in the rather eﬃcient large N limit, N being the number of colours
[18–20], both ∆S = 1 bosonized current-current [21] and density-density [22] oper-
ators factorize to form indeed the single octet operator given in (7) since one ﬁnds
respectively

(Q2 − Q1) ∝ [∂µU U +]dq[∂µU U +]qs = −[∂µU ∂µU +]ds ,

at O(p2, 0)

at O(p2, 0) (9)

Λ2 ∂α∂αU ]dq[U +− 1

Λ2 ∂β∂βU +]qs =

Λ2 [∂µU ∂µU +]ds ,

Q6 ∝ [U− 1
with Λ a chiral breaking scale ﬁxed by the FK/Fπ ratio of pseudoscalar decay
constants [22, 23]. The “0” in (p2, 0) indicates strict large N limit: 1/N = 0.
Secondly, in a dual QCD approach going beyond this strict large N factorization
limit in a coherent way [6], analytical tools allow us to keep distinguishing (Q2−Q1)
from Q6 operator even at the hadronic level through a matching of the slow SD
quark-gluon evolution above 1 GeV [24] with a fast LD meson evolution below
1 GeV [25]. Within such a dual frame based on a consistent 1/N expansion in the
strong coupling αs and 1/f 2
π, the values of hadronic matrix element of the penguin
operator Q6 in question turn out to lie below its large N value inferred from (9)
(and conventionally corresponding to B(1/2)
= 1 − O(
(cid:104)ππ(I = 0)|Q6|K(cid:105)dual QCD ∝ B(1/2)

at O(p2, 0) + O(p0, 1/N ) .
(10)
Let us emphasize that the negative sign of the 1/N loop correction induced by the
zero-derivative operator in (9) is in agreement with the SD evolution of B(1/2)
pa-
rameter analyzed in [26]. This then implies the result in (6), i.e., the 2σ tension

3 Strong ﬁnal state interactions

Figure 1: Strong (•) FSI eﬀect on weak ((cid:4)) hadronic matrix elements. The Cutcosky
cut (- - -) tells us to put internal mesons on the mass-shell to consistently identify any
absorptive part of the Feynman amplitude induced by the Q1,2 and Q6 operators.

when confronted with the measured CP-violating parameter [9, 10]. Yet, the ques-
tion of 1/N -suppressed strong FSI eﬀects on such a hadronic matrix element may
be raised at this point.

3 Strong ﬁnal state interactions

3.1 Standard Chiral Perturbation Theory
In this approach a pion loop should be appended to any local weak K → ππ transi-
tion in order to incorporate the strong ππ → ππ rescattering eﬀects and, in partic-
ular, FSI phase shifts at leading order. Following the well-known Cutcosky cutting
rule, this eﬀective bubble triggers some (1/N -suppressed) absorptive part whenever
the two mesons in the loop can be taken on-shell (see Fig. 1). Strong phases re-
sulting from these ﬁnal rescatterings are most easily factorized in the corresponding
isospin amplitudes, namely

AI ≡ |AI| exp(iδI ),

(I = 0, 2) .

(11)

However, the measured δ0 angle being rather large compared to δ2, one also expects
non-negligible dispersive corrections to the modulus |A0| of the ∆I = 1/2 amplitude
since real and imaginary parts are necessarily linked by analyticity and unitarity
constraints.
From a chiral perturbation point of view, one might then advocate [11–15],
that an overall dispersive factor R0 ≈ exp(1/N ) > 1 resulting from the all-order
resummation of 1/N -suppressed FSI should simply be applied to the weak decay
amplitude (7) and, in particular, to its indistinguishable penguin component. Doing
such an exponential rescaling in the strict factorization limit (9) for the Q6 operator
(i.e., for B(1/2)
= 1) to avoid any possible 1/N double counting, one would end up
this time with a QCD penguin hadronic matrix element well above its large N
value [11–15],
(cid:104)ππ(I = 0)|Q6|K(cid:105)ChPTh ∝ B(1/2)

at O(p2, 0) +O(p2, 1/N ) .
(12)
This would imply a better agreement with the measured value of ε(cid:48)/ε in (2) whenever
the ∆I = 1/2 rule (1) is assumed to begin with. However, one should keep in mind
that ε(cid:48) in itself is proportional to the imaginary part of ratio A2/A0:

6 R0 = 1 +O(

) > 1 ,

Taken as such without using (1), any overall increase of A0 (and decrease of A2) as
proposed in [11–15] would then imply a decrease of ε(cid:48)/ε.

So which bound on the B(1/2)

should one trust, the upper one (10) from dual
QCD or the lower one (12) from chiral perturbation supplemented by a large N
limit?

6

3.2 Dual QCD Approach
In the dual QCD approach [6], the O(p2, 1/N ) bubble correction generated by the
current-current operators Q1,2 does require some FSI dispersive rescaling. Indeed,
the associated O(p2, 0) on-shell tree-level amplitude corresponding to the right dia-
gram in Fig. 1 and computed from (8) is proportional to the SU(3)-breaking factor
π) and thus non-vanishing. However, the common O(p2, 0) result in (8) and
(m2
(9) of a strict large N factorization does not necessarily imply that the (Q2 − Q1)
and Q6 operators generate identical 1/N -suppressed FSI eﬀects.

K−m2

In fact, the (density-density) operator Q6 can also generate the chiral octet
operator [∂µU ∂µU +]ds through its zero-derivative term [U ]dq[U +]qs in (9). Clearly
undoable for the two-derivative operator (Q2 − Q1) in (8), this genuine O(p0, 1/N )
one-loop correction [10] uses Λ2(≈ 1 GeV2) as a sizeable substitute for p2(≈ m2
K). In
this context one should distinguish between dispersive and absorptive contributions
from the loop diagrams in Fig. 1.

6

• The operator [U ]dq[U +]qs contributes to the left loop diagram with oﬀ-shell
intermediate mesons and leads to a non-zero O(p0, 1/N ) dispersive term in (10)
calculated in [10]. This term competes with the O(p2, 0) tree-level value of the
B(1/2)
parameter in (10) as possibly foreseen from a simultaneous expansion
in p2 = O(δ) and 1/N = O(δ), the joint chiral and colour counting already
invoked elsewhere [27] for strong interaction physics.

• Most importantly, following Cutcosky cutting rule, the operator [U ]dq[U +]qs
does not imply any absorptive part since the associated tree-level amplitude
with on-shell pions and kaon in the right loop diagram of Fig. 1 identically
vanishes due to the unitarity property of the U (π) matrix for the light pseu-
doscalars

(cid:104)ππ(I = 0)|[U ]dq[U +]qs|K(cid:105) = 0

at O(p2, 0) .

(14)
This disparity between the FSI eﬀects on the matrix elements of (Q2 − Q1) and
Q6 operators is the main result of our paper, which cannot be highlighted within
an eﬀective (meson) ﬁeld approach like chiral perturbation theory where these two
operators are indistinguishable.

The absence of FSI impact on B(1/2)

at O(p0, 1/N ) can also be checked explicitly
through a one-loop calculation of the so-called factorizable and non-factorizable LD
contributions that are generated by the density-density penguin operator Q6. The
corresponding absorptive parts do indeed cancel each other, supporting in that
manner the leading upper bound (10) at the expense of the subleading lower bound
(12).

6

In fact, any attempt to include the ﬁrst impact of strong FSI on B(1/2)

would
require an expansion beyond the consistent O(δ) bound (10). Unfortunately a full
O(δ2) estimate of the B(1/2)
matrix element, with further O(p2, 1/N ) as well as

6

4 Comments and conclusion

5

genuine O(p0, 1/N 2) corrections in (12), is a task beyond the authors present skills.
Here we just recall that the pseudoscalar mass spectrum is reproduced within 15%
on the sole basis of the eﬀective Lagrangian for strong interactions at O(δ) [28],
with the axial U (1) breaking scale associated to a large η(cid:48) mass, its O(p0, 1/N )
component.

4 Comments and conclusion
The dispersive rescaling factors R0 ≈ 1.55 and R2 ≈ 0.92, corresponding respectively
to δ0 > 0 and δ2 < 0, have been extracted from an all-order resummation of the
1/N-suppressed FSI in [12, 15]. Naively applied to the hadronic matrix elements
of the free |∆S| = 1 weak Hamiltonian to avoid, once again, any possible double
counting, they would imply the following ∆I = 1/2 enhancement:

|A0|
|A2| =

√

2 × R0R2

≈ 2.4 .

(15)

In this rather peculiar large N limit indeed, only the Q2 operator with its two
charged currents survives such that the K0 → π0π0 neutral channel is purely induced
by π+π− → π0π0 rescattering. Further O(1/N ) corrections from strong interactions,
namely LD and SD evolutions [6], are obviously required to understand the measured
value in (1). Whatever the approach adopted, these corrections should be properly
combined with the FSI LD one given in (15).
Similarly, the FSI rescaling factors R0,2 applied to a strict large N value of the
QCD and electroweak penguin hadronic matrix elements (i.e., the one obtained for
B(1/2)

= 1 and B(3/2)

6

B(1/2)

= 1), namely
= 1 × R0 ≈ 1.55 ,

B(3/2)

8

= 1 × R2 ≈ 0.92

(16)

would also miss strong O(p0) and mild O(p2) 1/N contributions, respectively.
Relying now more speciﬁcally on a simultaneous expansion in p2 = O(δ) and
1/N = O(δ) in the dual QCD approach involving both SD and LD operator evolu-
tions at the one-loop level, we come then to the following conclusions:

• the all-order resummation of FSI eﬀects from the Q1,2 current-current oper-
ators would deﬁnitely help ﬁlling the persistent gap of about 30% between
theory and experiment for the ∆I = 1/2 rule [6], though some O(p2, 1/N )
double counting at the LD level seems diﬃcult to avoid within present analyt-
ical techniques;

• the ﬁrst FSI eﬀects induced by the Q6 density-density operator being sub-
leading in either p2 or 1/N within an appropriate chiral/color expansion, do
not really relax the tension recently highlighted in [9, 10] for the CP-violating
parameter ε(cid:48)/ε.
In other words, the FSI rescaling factors RI extracted from dispersive treatments
beyond one-loop [11–15] are relevant for the ∆I = 1/2 rule in [6], enhancing the
expectations that the ∆I = 1/2 rule is fully governed by SM dynamics. But then
the present lattice QCD result in (4) should go down by at least 30%.
On the other hand our ﬁndings imply that FSI are much less relevant for ε(cid:48)/ε
and diminish signiﬁcantly hopes that improved treatment of FSI within lattice QCD

approach and dual QCD approach would bring the SM prediction for ε(cid:48)/ε to agree
with the experimental data, opening thereby an arena for important new physics
contributions to this ratio. For latest analyses of such contributions see [29–32]
