FOCAL RADIUS, RIGIDITY, AND LOWER CURVATURE BOUNDS

LUIS GUIJARRO AND FREDERICK WILHELM

π

Abstract. We show that the focal radius of any submanifold N of positive dimension
in a manifold M with sectional curvature greater than or equal to 1 does not exceed
2 . In the case of equality, we show that N is totally geodesic in M and the universal
cover of M is isometric to a sphere or a projective space with their standard metrics,
provided N is closed.

Our results also hold for kth–intermediate Ricci curvature, provided the submanifold
has dimension ≥ k. Thus in a manifold with Ricci curvature ≥ n − 1, all hypersurfaces
have focal radius ≤ π
2 , and space forms are the only such manifolds where equality can
occur.

We also explore applications to group actions, Riemannian submersions, and subme-
tries of positively curved manifolds, including generalizations of some of the sectional
curvature results of Chen and Grove.

To prove the results, we use a new comparison lemma for Jacobi ﬁelds that exploits
Wilking’s transverse Jacobi equation. The new comparison lemma also yields an op-
timal estimate for the norm of any submanifold’s second fundamental form in terms
of its focal radius and the ambient manifold’s lower curvature bound. This leads to a
“soul-type” structure theorem for manifolds with nonnegative kth–intermediate Ricci
curvature that have a closed submanifold with dimension ≥ k and inﬁnite focal radius.

Myers theorem implies that every complete Riemannian n–manifold with Ricci cur-
vature ≥ n − 1 has conjugate radius ≤ π ([30]). We show that the focal radius of any
hypersurface is at most π
2 .

Theorem A. Let M be a complete Riemannian n–manifold with Ricci curvature ≥ n−1,
and let N be any hypersurface of M.

We emphasize that N need not be closed or even complete, and there is no hypothesis
about its second fundamental form. On the other hand, if N happens to be closed and
have focal radius π

Theorem B. Let M be a complete Riemannian n–manifold with Ricci curvature ≥ n−1.
If M contains a closed, embedded hypersurface N with focal radius π
2 , then the universal
cover of M is isometric to the unit sphere, and N is totally geodesic in M.

If M happens to have sectional curvature ≥ 1, then we will show that the submanifold

in Theorem A need only have positive dimension.

Theorem C. Let M be a complete Riemannian n–manifold with sectional curvature
≥ 1, and let N be any submanifold of M with dim (N) ≥ 1.

1. Every unit speed geodesic γ that leaves N orthogonally at time 0 has at least dim (N)

focal points for N in(cid:2)− π

N is ≤ π

2. If the focal radius of N is π

2 , then N is totally geodesic.

In the event that N is closed and has focal radius exactly π

2 , we obtain the following

analog of the Diameter Rigidity Theorem of Gromoll-Grove/Wilking ([22, 47]).

Theorem D. Let M be a complete Riemannian n–manifold with sectional curvature ≥ 1.
If M contains a closed, embedded submanifold N with focal radius π
2 , then the universal
cover of M is isometric to the unit sphere or a projective space with the standard metric,
and N is totally geodesic in M.

It is reasonable to compare Theorems A and C with the Bonnet-Myers Theorem,
and Theorem B with Cheng’s Maximal Diameter Theorem (cf also Theorem 3 in [14]
and Theorem 1 in [18]). While an analogy can be made between Theorem D and the
Diameter Rigidity Theorem, the following example shows that Theorem D applies to
more nonsimply connected manifolds than does the Diameter Rigidity Theorem.

Example E. Let S3 be the unit sphere in C ⊕ C, and embed S1 as the unit circle in the
ﬁrst copy of C. Let Q be the quaternion group of order 8 in SO (4) . Then N = Q (S1) /Q
has focal radius π
2 inside of M = S3/Q, providing an example of Theorem D in which N
is its own focal set. On the other hand, M has diameter strictly smaller than π
2 .

More generally, let π : Sn −→ Sn/G be the quotient map of a properly discontinuous
action by G on Sn, and let N be any closed geodesic in Sn/G. Then π−1 (N) is the
disjoint union of closed geodesics in Sn, and hence both π−1 (N) and N have focal radius
π
2 .

Theorem D implies that the standard unit metric is the only one on any topological
sphere with curvature ≥ 1 that has a closed submanifold with focal radius π
2 . In contrast,
the conclusion of the Diameter Rigidity Theorem is softer, since there are many metrics
on Sn with curvature ≥ 1 and diameter ≥ π
2 , and there is even the possibility of such a
metric on an exotic sphere. The lack of exotic spheres in the conclusion of Theorem D
makes it more comparable to the 1
4–pinched results of Brendle–Schoen and Berger ([10,
11, 8]). However, joins of small constant curvature spheres suggest that new phenomena
need to be considered if one hopes to prove an almost rigid version of Theorem D in
the spirit of the almost 1
4–pinched results of Abresch-Meyer, Berger, and Petersen-Tao
([1, 9, 34]).

FOCAL RADIUS, RIGIDITY, AND LOWER CURVATURE BOUNDS

It is also reasonable to compare Theorem D to the “rank rigidity” results of Schmidt
and Shankar–Spatzier–Wilking in [38] and [41]. Shankar, Spatzier, and Wilking obtained
the conclusion of Theorem D for manifolds with curvature less than or equal to 1 and
minimal conjugate radius π. Schmidt proves that if M has sectional curvature ≥ 1 and
conjugate radius ≥ π
2 , then its universal cover is homeomorphic to Sn or isometric to
a projective space. The conjugate radius hypotheses of these theorems apply to every
geodesic in M. In contrast, the focal radius hypothesis of Theorem D only concerns the
geodesics that meet a single submanifold orthogonally.

Theorems A, B, C, and D are special cases of analogous results for positive intermedi-
ate Ricci curvature. Recall ([48], [42]) that for k ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n − 1} , M is said to have
kth–intermediate Ricci curvature ≥ l if and only if for any orthonormal (k + 1)–frame
{v, w1, w2, . . . , wk} , the sectional curvature sum, Σk
i=1sec (v, wi) , is ≥ l. For brevity we
will write Rick M ≥ l to mean that the kth–intermediate Ricci curvature of M is greater
than or equal to l. Clearly,

1. Ric1M ≥ l if and only if all sectional curvatures of M are ≥ l.
2. Ricn−1M ≥ l if and only if M has Ricci curvature ≥ l, and
3. RickM ≥ kl implies that Rick+1M ≥ (k + 1) l.
Theorems A and C are therefore special cases of the following results.

Theorem F. Let M be a complete Riemannian n–manifold with Rick ≥ k and N be
any submanifold of M with dim (N) ≥ k.

1. Every unit speed geodesic γ that leaves N orthogonally at time 0 has at least

dim (N) − k + 1 focal points for N in (cid:2)− π

the focal radius of N is ≤ π
2 .

2 , π

2(cid:3) , counting multiplicities. In particular,

2. If the focal radius of N is π

2 , then N is totally geodesic.

Similarly, Theorems B and D are special cases of the following result.

Theorem G. Let M be a complete Riemannian n–manifold with Rick ≥ k. If M con-
tains a closed, embedded, submanifold N with focal radius π
2 and dim (N) ≥ k, then the
universal cover of M is isometric to the sphere or a projective space with the standard
metrics, and N is totally geodesic in M.

Theorems F and G have consequences for Riemannian submersions, isometric group
actions, and Riemannian foliations of manifolds with positive intermediate Ricci curva-
ture. To state them succinctly, we recall the deﬁnition of “manifold submetry” from
[12].

Deﬁnition. A submetry

π : M −→ X

of a Riemannian manifold is called a “manifold submetry” if and only if π−1 (x) is
a closed smooth submanifold for all x ∈ X and every geodesic of M that is initially
perpendicular to a ﬁber of π is everywhere perpendicular to the ﬁbers of π.

If the leaves of a singular Riemannian foliation are closed, then as pointed out in
[12], its quotient map is a manifold submetry. Thus the following result applies to

4

LUIS GUIJARRO AND FREDERICK WILHELM

singular Riemannian foliations with closed leaves. In particular, it applies to quotient
maps of isometric group actions and to Riemannian submersions. In it, we use the term
“geodesic” to mean a curve that locally minimizes distances but need not be a globally
shortest path.

Theorem H. Let

π : M −→ X

be a manifold submetry of a complete Riemannian n–manifold with Rick ≥ k. Suppose
that for some x ∈ X, dim π−1 (x) ≥ k.
1. For every geodesic γ emanating from x, either γ does not extend to a geodesic on any

2(cid:3) , or γ has a conjugate point to x in (cid:2) −π

of X at x is ≤ π

conjugate points on (cid:0) −π

2(cid:3) . In
2(cid:3) and are free of
2(cid:1) , then π−1 (x) is totally geodesic in M, and the universal

cover of M is isometric to the sphere or a projective space with the standard metrics.
3. If dim π−1 (x) ≥ k for some x ∈ X for which max {distx} = diam (X) , then the
diameter of X is ≤ π
2 .

2 , π

Projective spaces viewed as the bases of Hopf ﬁbrations show that the conjugate
radius estimate in Part 1 is optimal. The conclusion about the extendability of γ is also
optimal.

Example. Let SO (n) act reducibly on Sn in the usual way, by cohomogeneity one. Let
x ∈ Sn/SO (n) be the orbit of the equator. The geodesic passing through x at time 0

extends to (cid:2)− π

larger interval.

2 , π

2(cid:3) , where it is free of conjugate points, but it does not extend to any

This example also shows that for Part 3 of Theorem H, it is not enough to know that
dim π−1 (x) ≥ k for some x ∈ X; we must also assume that x realizes the diameter of
X.

Remark. By Theorem 1 of [35], X need not have positive Ricci curvature, even when
π is a Riemannian submersion. So neither the ﬁrst nor third conclusion of Theorem H
follow from the Bonnet-Myers Theorem.

Remark. The sense in which γ has a conjugate point can be described via variations.
(See Deﬁnition 10.1 below.) There are also various notions of conjugacy in length spaces
proposed by Shankar and Sormani in [40]. Our variational notion is more readily adapt-
able to the situation of Theorem H than are any of those in [40]. All of the deﬁnitions
have the common feature that γ stops minimizing after a conjugate point.

Remark. By results in [21] and [47], the possibilities for π in Part 2 of Theorem H can
be listed, if π is a Riemannian submersion. More generally, Riemannian foliations of
round spheres are classiﬁed if they are either nonsingular ([29]) or they are singular and
have ﬁber dimension ≤ 3 ([37]). However, the singular Riemannian foliations of round
spheres have not been classiﬁed, and there is an abundance of examples ([36]).

The version of Theorem H when k = 1 yields, via a diﬀerent proof, the inequality
statements of Chen and Grove in Theorems A and B in [12], with the additional in-
formation about the behavior of geodesics from conclusion 1. In particular, if π is a
Riemannian submersion, it follows that the conjugate radius of X is ≤ π
2 . For a Rie-
mannian submersion π : M n+k −→ Bn with the sectional curvature of M ≥ 1, Theorem
A of [19] gives that

In particular, the conjugate radius of B is ≤ π

2 if k ≥ n − 1. (Cf also Corollary 1.2 of

Theorem H has the following consequence for cohomogeneity one actions.

Corollary I. Let M be a complete Riemannian manifold M with Rick ≥ k. If G×M −→
M is an isometric, cohomogeneity one action with a singular orbit of dimension ≥ k,
then the following hold.
1. The diameter of M/G is ≤ π
2 .
If the diameter of M/G is π
2 , then the universal cover of M is isometric to the
2.
sphere or a projective space with the standard metrics, and the singular orbits are totally
geodesic in M.

Part 1 of the previous result has the following corollary.

Corollary J. Let M be a complete Riemannian manifold M with Rick ≥ k. If G×M −→
M is an isometric, cohomogeneity one action and the diameter of M/G is > π
2 , then
both singular orbits have dimension ≤ k − 1. In particular, if sec(M) ≥ 1, then both
singular orbits are ﬁxed points.

Remark. The sectional curvature statement in Corollary J can be inferred from Corol-
lary 2.7 of [12].

Next we give examples showing that the hypotheses about the dimension of the sub-
manifolds in the Theorems above cannot be removed. For the two sectional curvature
theorems, C and D, a point in small perturbation of Sn shows that the conclusions can
be false if N does not have positive dimension. For the Ricci curvature theorems, we
have the following examples.

Example K. Let Sn

Thus the hypothesis that N is a hypersurface in Theorem A cannot be replaced with
the hypothesis that N is a codimension 2 submanifold, and the Riemannian submersion
3 shows we cannot replace the hypothesis that dim π−1 (x) ≥ k in Parts 1

So Theorem B is optimal in the sense that the hypothesis that N is a hypersurface cannot
be replaced with the assumption that N is codimension 2.

It is natural ask about versions of Theorems A and B with the hypersurface replaced

by a submanifold and π/2 replaced with the appropriate constant r ∈ (cid:0) π

following example shows that r cannot be taken to be independent of the dimension of
M if there is no hypothesis about the codimension of N.

So in Theorem F, the focal radius of N can converge to π, if there is no hypothesis about
the dimension of N, and the dimension of M is allowed to go to ∞.

To prove Theorems F and G, we exploit Wilking’s transverse Jacobi equation ([46])
to get a new comparison lemma for Jacobi ﬁelds. To state it, we let γ : (−∞, ∞) −→ M
be a unit speed geodesic in a complete Riemannian n–manifold M. We call an (n − 1)–
dimensional subspace Λ of normal Jacobi ﬁelds along γ, Lagrangian, if the restriction of
the Riccati operator to Λ is self adjoint, that is, if

hJ1 (t) , J ′

2 (t)i = hJ ′

1 (t) , J2 (t)i

for all t and for all J1, J2 ∈ Λ (see 1.0.12 below for the formal deﬁnition of the Riccati
operator on Λ).

For κ = −1, 0, or 1, let S 2

κ be the the simply connected 2–dimensional space form of
constant curvature κ. Let ˜Λ be a Lagrangian subspace of normal Jacobi ﬁelds along a
geodesic ˜γ in S 2

κ, let

˜λ (t) be the eigenvalue of the Riccati operator of ˜Λ at time t,

(0.0.1)

and let ˜f be a function so that

where ˜E is a parallel ﬁeld along ˜γ.
The Lagrangian subspaces in S 2

possibilities for ˜f are

κ are the spans of single normal Jacobi ﬁelds, so the

if κ = 0,
if κ = −1,

(0.0.3)

where c1, c2 ∈ R, and the possibilities for ˜λ are the logarithmic derivatives of the func-
tions in 0.0.3. These are given explicitly on page 302 of [16].

In Section 1, we review Wilking’s transverse Jacobi equation, justify the name La-

grangian, and prove the following comparison lemma.

Lemma O. (Sectional Curvature Comparison) For κ = −1, 0, or 1, let γ : (−∞, ∞) −→
M be a unit speed geodesic in a complete Riemannian n–manifold M with sec( ˙γ, ·) ≥ κ.
Let J0 be a nonzero, normal Jacobi ﬁeld along γ, and let Λ be a Lagrangian subspace of
normal Jacobi ﬁelds along γ with Riccati operator S such that J0 ∈ Λ.

For t0 < tmax, suppose that Λ has no singularities on (t0, tmax) , and for some La-

grangian subspace ˜Λ along ˜γ in S 2
κ,

hS (J0) , J0i |t0 ≤ ˜λ (t0) |J0 (t0)|2 .

LUIS GUIJARRO AND FREDERICK WILHELM

1. For each t1 ∈ [t0, tmax) there is a J1 ∈ Λ \ {0} so that

hS (J1) , J1i |t1 ≤ ˜λ (t1) |J1 (t1)|2 .

(0.0.5)
In particular, if κ = 1, α ∈ [0, π) , ˜λ (t) = cot (t + α), and t0 ∈ [0, π − α) , then Λ has
a singularity by time π − α, that is, there is a J ∈ Λ \ {0} with J (t2) = 0 for some
t2 ∈ (t0, π − α] .
2. For t ∈ [t0, tmax) , set

{J0}⊥ (t) ≡ {L ∈ Λ | L (t) ⊥ J0 (t)} .

If for some t1 ∈ (t0, tmax) ,

and

then for all s ∈ [t0, t1] ,

{J0}⊥ (t1) = {J0}⊥ (t0)

hS (J0) , J0i |t1 = ˜λ (t1) |J0 (t1)|2 ,

hS (J0) , J0i |s = ˜λ (s) |J0 (s)|2 ,

(0.0.6)

and the subspaces {J0}⊥ (s) are independent of s ∈ [t0, t1] . Moreover, on [t0, t1] ,

J0 (s) = ˜f (s) E,

where E is a unit parallel ﬁeld and ˜f is the function from 0.0.2 that satisﬁes ˜f (t0) =
|J0 (t0)| .

for all J ∈ Λ \ {0} and all s ∈ (t0, tmax) .

In applications of Lemma O, it is often important to exploit the fact that the families
of functions in (0.0.3) are invariant under horizontal shifts. For example, when κ = 1
and t0 = 0, the possibilities for ˜λ are given by

˜λ (t) = cot (t − α) ,

where α ∈ [0, π) and tmax = π − α. Lemma O also holds when t0 is a singular value of
˜λ (t) = ∞. For instance, when κ = 1, t0 = 0, and ˜λ (t) = cot (t) , Lemma
˜λ with limt→t+
O recapitulates the classical Rauch Comparison Theorem for positive curvature with a
slightly diﬀerent conclusion, since J1 need not equal J0 (see Example 2.6).

0

In general, any normal Jacobi ﬁeld is part of a Lagrangian subspace Λ that is nonsin-
gular on (t0, t0 + ε) for some ε > 0. So to apply Lemma O for a short time, we only need
the initial condition, (0.0.4). To get Inequality (0.0.5) on [t0, tmax) , we need to know
that some Lagrangian subspace Λ that contains J is nonsingular on [t0, tmax) .

In contrast to the Rauch Comparison Theorem ([15], pages 215, 234), Lemma O is
valid for any initial condition (0.0.4). In this sense, it should be compared to the Riccati
comparison theorem of Eschenburg-Heintze on page 210 of [17]. In contrast to the later
result, the hypotheses of Lemma O only demand that the initial condition holds for a
single Jacobi ﬁeld. This comes at the expense that the derived future inequality (0.0.5)
is only guaranteed to hold for a single Jacobi ﬁeld, which moreover, is not likely to be
the original ﬁeld. In Example 2.6 (below), we show that J1 can in fact be diﬀerent from

FOCAL RADIUS, RIGIDITY, AND LOWER CURVATURE BOUNDS

J0. This phenomenon is tied to the nonvanishing of Wilking’s generalized A–tensor. (See
Equation (1.1.2) below for the deﬁnition of the generalized A–tensor.)

The diﬀerence between Lemma O and the theorem of [17] is starker if one considers
the contrapositives: Lemma O implies that if Inequality 0.0.5 fails for all J1 ∈ Λ, then
Inequality 0.0.4 fails for all J ∈ Λ. In contrast, the theorem of [17] only gives that
Inequality 0.0.4 fails for some J ∈ Λ. For example, using Lemma O we will prove

Theorem P. For κ = −1, 0, or 1, let M be a complete Riemannian n–manifold with
sectional curvature ≥ κ, and let N be any submanifold of M with dim (N) ≥ 1. Then
the second fundamental form IIN of N satisﬁes

|IIN | ≤ cot (FocalRadius (N))
|IIN | ≤

FocalRadius(N )

1

if κ = 1,

if κ = 0, and

(0.0.7)

|IIN | ≤ coth (FocalRadius (N))

if κ = −1.

In particular, if κ = 0 and the focal radius of N is inﬁnite, then N is totally geodesic.

Metric balls in space forms show that Theorem P is optimal in the sense that for
every κ and every possible focal radius, there is a hypersurface in a space with constant
curvature κ for which Inequality (0.0.7) is an equality.

Before stating our comparison lemma for intermediate Ricci curvature, we clarify some

notation. For a subspace W ⊂ Λ, we write

W (t) = { J (t) | J ∈ W } ⊕ { J ′ (t) | J ∈ W and J (t) = 0} ,

and

for orthogonal projection. For simplicity of notation we will write

Trace (S (t) |W ) for Trace (PW,t ◦ S (t) |W ) .

PW,t : Λ (t) −→ W (t)

By considering 1–dimensional subspaces, we see that Lemma O is a special case of the
following result.

Trace (S (t) |Wt) ≤ k · ˜λ (t) .

and

{Wt0}⊥ (t1) = {Wt0}⊥ (t0)

Trace(cid:0)S (t1) |Wt0(cid:1) = k · ˜λ (t1) ,

then Wt0 consists of Jacobi ﬁelds whose restrictions to [t0, t1] have the form

where E is a parallel ﬁeld and ˜f is the function from 0.0.2 that satisﬁes ˜f (t0) = |J (t0)| .
Moreover, for t ∈ (t0, t1] , the subspaces

J = ˜f · E,

t ≡ { J ∈ Λ | J (t) ⊥ Wt0 (t)}

In Theorem 3.1 (below), we state a generalization of Theorem P for intermediate Ricci
curvature. As a consequence, we will get the following result, which in the case of Ricci
curvature is Theorem 3 of [18].

with Rick ≥ 0.
3. exp⊥

Theorem R. Let M be a complete Riemannian n–manifold with Rick ≥ 0, and let N
be any closed submanifold of M with dim (N) ≥ k and inﬁnite focal radius.
1. N is totally geodesic.

2. The normal bundle ν (N) with the pull back metric(cid:0)exp⊥
N(cid:1)∗
N(cid:1)∗(cid:1) −→ (M, g) is a Riemannian cover.
4. The zero section N0 is totally geodesic in(cid:0)ν (N) ,(cid:0)exp⊥
(g)(cid:1) .
N(cid:1)∗
5. The projection π :(cid:0)ν (N) ,(cid:0)exp⊥
N(cid:1)∗

N :(cid:0)ν (N) ,(cid:0)exp⊥

(g)(cid:1) −→ N is a Riemannian submersion.

6. If c : I −→ N is a unit speed geodesic in N, and V is a parallel normal ﬁeld along c,
then

(g) is a complete manifold

Φ (s, t) = exp⊥

Φ : I × R −→ M,

c(s) (tV (s))
is a totally geodesic immersion whose image has constant curvature 0.
7. All radial sectional curvatures from N are nonnegative. That is, for γ (t) = exp⊥
with v ∈ ν (N) , the curvature of any plane containing γ ′ (t) is nonnegative.
8. If n ≥ 3 and k ≤ n − 2, then for all r > 0, the intrinsic metric on exp⊥
N (S (N0, r))
has Rick ≥ 0, here S (N0, r) is the metric r–sphere around the zero section N0 in ν (N) .

N (tv)

In the special case of sectional curvature, this yields new information about open

nonnegatively curved manifolds.

Corollary S. Let N be a closed submanifold in a complete, noncompact, simply con-
nected nonnegatively curved manifold (M, g) . If N has inﬁnite focal radius, then N is a
soul of M.

FOCAL RADIUS, RIGIDITY, AND LOWER CURVATURE BOUNDS

11

Remark. While examples show that souls need not have inﬁnite focal radius, using the
main theorem of [24], we can always modify the metric of M so that its soul has inﬁnite
focal radius.

Remark. The version of Part 8 of Theorem R for nonnegative sectional curvature and
small r is similar to Theorem 2.5 of [25]. In the latter result, N needs to be a soul of M
but can have any focal radius.

The proof of Theorem G begins by establishing Proposition 4.3, which is a structure
result for maximal focal radius in positive curvature whose role is analogous to that
of Theorem R in nonnegative curvature. Proposition 4.3 also draws a strong analogy
between N and one of the dual sets in the proof of the Diameter Rigidity Theorem.
Example E shows that we can only push this analogy so far. The dual sets of [22] are
disjoint while Example E shows that N can be its own focal set. In fact, one of the
challenges of the proof of Theorem G is showing that phenomena like Example E do not
occur in the simply connected case. In spite of the diﬀerences, our overall strategy is
similar to that of [22], and our proof employs ideas from there. To keep the exposition
tight, we will often refrain from giving further speciﬁc references to [22] and have made
our exposition reasonably self-contained.

To show that phenomena like Example E do not occur in the simply connected case,
we prove, in Lemma 5.6, that our focal set F is regular in the sense of Hebda ([27], cf
[45]). This allows us to appeal to Theorem 3.1 in [27] and conclude, in Theorem 6.2,
that M is the union of two disk bundles.

After the introduction, we establish notations and conventions. The remainder of
the paper is divided into three parts and 10 sections. The sections are subordinate to
the parts. Each part and many of the sections begin with a detailed summary of the
contents, so the outline immediately below is only meant to indicate where each result
is proven.

The logical relationships among the results are:

Theorem F =⇒ Theorems A and C
Theorem G =⇒ Theorems B and D
Theorem H =⇒ Corollary I =⇒ Corollary J
Lemma Q =⇒ Lemma O
Theorem R =⇒ Corollary S.

Thus it only remains to prove Theorems F, G, H, P, and R, and Lemma Q.

Part 1 contains Sections 1, 2, and 3. In Section 1, we review Riccati comparison and
Wilking’s transverse Jacobi equation. We prove Theorem F and Lemma Q in Section
2. In subsection 2.1, we provide an example that shows that J0 and J1 can indeed be
diﬀerent in Lemma O. In Section 3, we prove Theorems P and R.

In Part 2, we prove Theorem G in Sections 4—8. In the special case of Theorem D,
when the sectional curvature is ≥ 1, the argument can be completed a little faster by
an appeal to the Diameter Rigidity Theorem. We do this in Section 7, and we complete
the proof of Theorem G in Section 8.

12

LUIS GUIJARRO AND FREDERICK WILHELM

In Part 3, we establish some basics of submetries and holonomy in Section 9 and prove

Theorem H in Section 10.

Remark. The reader may have noticed that the hypothesis Rick ≥ k · κ of Lemma Q is
global, whereas in Lemma O, we only assumed that sec( ˙γ, ·) ≥ κ. For the conclusion of
Lemma Q to hold, we in fact, only need Rick ( ˙γ, ·) ≥ k · κ, that is,

sec ( ˙γ, Ei) ≥ k · κ

kXi=1

for any orthonormal set { ˙γ, E1, . . . , Ek} . It is also true, with the possible exceptions of
Theorems D, G, and H and Corollaries I and J, that all of our results hold when only
the corresponding lower bound on radial curvatures is assumed. To keep the exposition
as straightforward as possible, we have stated all of our results with the global hypothesis,
except for Lemma O. This is because we will need to use the more general version of
Lemma O in the proof of Theorem G. (See Lemma 5.5 and Proposition 4.3.)

Notations and Conventions

Unless otherwise speciﬁed, all curves are parameterized at unit speed. Given v ∈ T M,

we denote the unique geodesic with γ ′

v (0) = v by γv.

Let N be a submanifold of the Riemannian manifold M. Let ν (N) be the normal
bundle of N ⊂ M. For every unit v ∈ ν (N) , there is a ﬁrst time t1 ∈ (0, ∞] at which
γv (t1) is focal for N along γv. We set

regN ≡ {tv ∈ ν (N) |

|v| = 1 and t ∈ [0, t1)} .

We let g∗ be the metric on the domain regN obtained from pulling back (M, g) via the
normal exponential map. We use the term tangent focal point for a critical point of
exp⊥

N : ν (N) −→ M and the term focal point for a critical value of exp⊥
N .
π : ν (N) −→ N will denote the projection of the normal bundle; N0 will be the
0–section of ν (N) , and ν1 (N) will be the unit normal bundle of N. The ﬁbers of ν (N)
and ν1 (N) over x ∈ N will be called ν x (N) and ν1

x (N).

We let Λ be any Lagrangian family of normal Jacobi ﬁelds along a geodesic γ, and for

any subspace L ⊂ Λ we write

L (t) ≡ { J (t) | J ∈ L} ⊕ { J ′ (t) | J ∈ L and J (t) = 0} .

When γ is a geodesic that leaves N orthogonally at time 0, we will write ΛN for the La-
grangian family of normal Jacobi ﬁelds along γ corresponding to variations by geodesics

FOCAL RADIUS, RIGIDITY, AND LOWER CURVATURE BOUNDS

that leave N orthogonally at time 0. According to Lemma 4.1 on page 227 of [15], ΛN
consists of the following normal Jacobi ﬁelds J along γ:

ΛN ≡(cid:8)J|J (0) = 0, J ′ (0) ∈ ν γ(0) (N)(cid:9) ⊕(cid:8)J|J (0) ∈ Tγ(0)N and J ′ (0) = Sγ ′(0)J (0)(cid:9) ,

where Sγ ′(0) is the shape operator of N determined by γ ′ (0) , that is,

(0.0.10)

Sγ ′(0)

Sγ ′(0)

: Tγv(0)N −→ Tγv (0)N is
: w 7−→ (∇wγ ′ (0))T N .

Unless otherwise speciﬁed, we assume that Λ is nonsingular on (t0, tmax) . That is, the
evaluation map Et : Λ −→ Tγ(t)M, Et (J) = J (t) is one-to-one for all t ∈ (t0, tmax) .

We write Sn for the unit sphere in Rn+1.
We use the acronym CROSS for Compact Rank One Symmetric Space. For conve-
nience, we normalize the nonspherical CROSSes so that their curvatures are in [1, 4] ,
and we normalize the spherical CROSSes to have constant curvature 4.

We write sec for sectional curvature and κ for our lower curvature bound. After

rescaling, we may always assume that κ is either −1, 0, or 1.

Given r > 0 and A ⊂ M we set

B (A, r) ≡ { x ∈ M | dist (x, A) < r} ,
D (A, r) ≡ { x ∈ M | dist (x, A) ≤ r} , and
S (A, r) ≡ { x ∈ M | dist (x, A) = r} .

Finally, we write Dv (f ) the derivative of f in the direction v.

Part 1. Bounding the Focal Radius

Part 1 is divided into Sections 1, 2, and 3. In Section 1, we review Lagrangian families,
Wilking’s transverse Jacobi equation, and Riccati comparison. We prove Lemma Q and
Theorem F in Section 2 and Theorems P and R in Section 3.

1. Jacobi Field Comparison

In this section, we review Lagrangian families, Wilking’s transverse Jacobi equation,

and Riccati comparison.

1.1. Lagrangian Families. Let γ be a unit speed geodesic in a complete Riemannian
n–manifold M, and let J be the vector space of normal Jacobi ﬁelds along γ. Using
symmetries of the curvature tensor, we see that for J1, J2 ∈ J ,

ω (J1, J2) = hJ ′

1, J2i − hJ1, J ′

2i ,

is constant along γ and hence deﬁnes a symplectic form on J .

Thus an (n − 1)–dimensional subspace Λ of J on which ω vanishes is called La-
grangian. Of course this is equivalent to saying that the restriction of the Riccati op-
erator to Λ is self-adjoint. Examples of Lagrangian families include the Jacobi ﬁelds
that are 0 at time 0 and those that correspond to variations by geodesics that leave a
submanifold orthogonally at time 0.

The set of times t so that

{J(t) | J ∈ Λ} = span { ˙γ (t)}⊥

(1.0.11)

is open and dense (cf Lemma 1.7 of [23]). For these t we get a well-deﬁned Riccati
operator

: v 7−→ J ′

v (t) ,

(1.0.12)

where Jv is the unique Jv ∈ Λ so that Jv (t) = v. The Jacobi equation then decomposes
into the two ﬁrst order equations

S (J) = J ′, S ′ + S2 + R = 0,

where S ′ is the covariant derivative of S along γ and R is the curvature along γ, that is
R (·) = R (·, ˙γ) ˙γ (see Equation 1.7.1 in [23]).

1.2. Wilking’s Transverse Jacobi Equation. Let V be any subspace of Λ. Set

V (t) ≡ {J(t) | J ∈ V} ⊕ {J ′(t) | J ∈ V, J(t) = 0}.

(1.0.13)

Then V (t) is a smooth vector bundle along γ (Lemma 1.7.1 in [23], or [46]). Set

Proposition 1.1. Let

H(t) ≡ V (t)⊥ ∩ ˙γ(t)⊥.

Et
Et

: Λ −→ Tγ(t)M
: J 7−→ J (t)

be the evaluation map, and suppose that the kernel of Et lies in V.
1. For x ∈ H (t) , there is a J ∈ Λ so that J (t) = x.
2. We have a well-deﬁned Riccati operator

ˆS : H (t) −→ H (t)

given by

ˆS (x) =(cid:16)(cid:0)J H(cid:1)′(cid:17)H

(t) ,

(1.1.1)

where J is an element of Λ so that J (t) = x, and J H (t) is the H (t)–component of J (t) .

Proof. Since Λ is Lagrangian, the splitting

Λ (t) = {J(t) | J ∈ Λ} ⊕ {J ′(t) | J ∈ Λ, J(t) = 0}

is orthogonal. Since the kernel of Et lies in V, H (t) is contained in the ﬁrst summand,
and Part 1 follows.

For the second part, suppose x = J (t) + K (t) , where K ∈ Kernel (Et) . Since

Kernel (Et) ⊂ V,

Wilking also deﬁned maps

At

: V (t) −→ H (t) given by,

At (v) = (J ′)h (t) , where J ∈ V, J (t) = v.

(1.1.2)

A priori, At is only deﬁned at points where V (t) = {J(t) | J ∈ V}; however, A extends
t : H (t) −→ V (t) be the adjoint of At, and let

smoothly to R (cf. [46]). Indeed, let A∗
X be a ﬁeld in H so that (X ′)H ≡ 0. According to Equation 1.7.6 on page 38 of [23],

X ′ = −A∗ (X) .

Since the left-hand side is smooth, A∗ is smooth, and it follows that A is smooth.

Like the Gray-O’Neill A–tensor, the Wilking A–tensor vanishes identically along a
geodesic γ if and only if the distributions V (t) and H (t) are parallel along γ. In this
case, it follows that

{ J ∈ Λ | J (t) ∈ H (t)}

is independent of t, and the parallel, orthogonal splitting V (t) ⊕ H (t) is given by Jacobi
ﬁelds.
Theorem 1.2. (Wilking, [46]) ˆS is self-adjoint, and

ˆS ′ + ˆS2 + {R (·, ˙γ) ˙γ}h + 3AA∗ = 0.

(1.2.1)

Remark 1.3. Equation 1.2.1 is known as the Transverse Jacobi Equation. It is a vast
generalization of the Horizontal Curvature Equation of [20] and [31]. For details see [26]
or [28].

Remark 1.4. Proposition 1.1 only gives us that ˆS is deﬁned almost everywhere. How-
ever, since {R (·, ˙γ) ˙γ}h + 3AA∗ is smooth everywhere, it follows that ˆS ′ + ˆS2 has a
smooth extension to all of R. (See [46] for an interpretation of ˆS ′ + ˆS2 as a second order
diﬀerential operator H (t) −→ H (t) .)

1.3. Riccati Comparison. In this subsection, we review the Riccati comparison results
of Eschenburg ([16]) and Eschenburg–Heintze ([17]).

Theorem 1.5. (Eschenburg–Heintze, [17], cf Proposition 2.3 in [16]) Let r : R −→ R
be a C ∞–function with r ≥ κ. For κ = 0 or −1 let t0 ∈ R and for κ = 1, let t0 ∈ [0, π] .
Let s be a smooth solution of the initial value problem

s′ + s2 + r = 0, s (t0) ≤ ˜λ (t0)

on the interval [t0, tmax) , where ˜λ is as in 0.0.1. Then
1.

s (t) ≤ ˜λ (t)

on [t0, tmax) .
2. If s (t1) = ˜λ (t1) for some t1 ∈ (t0, tmax) , then for all t ∈ [t0, t1]

s (t) = ˜λ (t) and r|[t0,t1] ≡ κ.

(1.5.1)

(1.5.2)

16

LUIS GUIJARRO AND FREDERICK WILHELM

When s is the trace of the Riccati operator of a Lagrangian family in Ric ≥ κ (n − 1) ,
the rigidity of Part 2 in Theorem 1.5 also yields rigidity of S and R (·, ˙γ) ˙γ. This idea
goes back at least as far as the Splitting Theorem ([3]) and Cheng’s Maximal Diameter
Theorem, ([13]).
It also appears in Croke and Kleiner’s paper on rigidity of warped
products ([14]), in Theorem 1.7.1 of [23], and in Theorem H of [26]. Since our applications
will be to the transverse Jacobi equation, we formulate it in terms of abstract Riccati
equations.
Lemma 1.6. For t ∈ [t0, tmax) , let ˆS (t) , ˆR (t) : V −→ V be symmetric endomorphisms
of a k–dimensional vector space V so that

ˆS ′ + ˆS2 + ˆR = 0.

Let ˜λ be as in 0.0.1 and have no singularities on (t0, tmax), and suppose that

for all t ∈ [t0, tmax) . Then

if any of the following hold.
1. If

Trace(cid:16) ˆS(cid:17) (t0) ≤ k · ˜λ (t0) , and

Trace(cid:16) ˆR(cid:17) (t) ≥ k · κ

(1.6.1)

(1.6.4)

then 1.6.2 holds on [t0, tmax) .
2. If tmax = ∞, κ = 0 = ˜λ (t0) , then 1.6.2 holds on [t0, ∞) .
3. If Trace ˆS (t1) = k˜λ (t1) for some t1 ∈ (t0, tmax] , then 1.6.2 holds on [t0, t1] .

In particular, if the hypotheses of any of 1, 2, or 3 hold, then the solutions of the
Jacobi equation J ′′ + ˆR (J) = 0 on (t0, tmax) , (t0, ∞) , or (t0, t1) , respectively, have the
form

(1.6.3)
where E is a constant vector in V and ˜f is the function from 0.0.2 that satisﬁes ˜f (t0) =

(see, e.g., page 302 of [16]). Since ˜λ has no singularities on (t0, tmax) , it follows that ˜λ (t)
is strictly decreasing on (t0, tmax) . So if Inequality 1.6.5 is strict for some t1 ∈ (t0, tmax),
then there is an α ∈ (0, tmax − t1) so that

Thus by 1.5.1,

s (t1) ≤ ˜λ (t1 + α) .

s (t) ≤ ˜λ (t + α)

for all t ∈ (t1, tmax) . In particular, for some ˜tmax ∈ (t0, tmax − α] , limt→˜t−

Since this contradicts our hypothesis that ˆS is deﬁned on (t0, tmax) , Inequality 1.6.5

it suﬃces to prove Part 3.

contradicts our hypothesis that ˆS is deﬁned on [t0, ∞) , Inequality 1.6.6 must be an
equality for all t ∈ (t0, tmax) . In particular, to complete the proof of Part 2, it suﬃces to
prove Part 3.

For part 3, ﬁrst observe that Equation 1.5.2 gives us s(t) ≡ ˜λ (t) and r ≡ κ.

the classical Rauch Comparison Theorem for 2–manifolds.

2. Focal Radius and Positive Curvature

In this section, we combine Riccati comparison with the Transverse Jacobi Equation
to prove Lemma Q and Theorem F, and in Subsection 2.1, we give an example to show
that the ﬁelds J0 and J1 in Lemma O can indeed be diﬀerent.

Proof of Lemma Q. We combine Theorem 1.5 and Lemma 1.6 with the Transverse Ja-

Start by setting

V ≡ {X ∈ Λ | X (t0) ⊥ J (t0) for all J ∈ Wt0} .

Let ˆS : H (t) −→ H (t) be as in Equation 1.1.1. It follows from Lemma 2.1 that

Trace(cid:16) ˆS(cid:17)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t0

≤ k · ˜λ (t0) .

The Transverse Jacobi Equation says,

ˆS ′ + ˆS2 + {R (·, ˙γ(t)) ˙γ(t)}h + 3AA∗ = 0.

(2.1.2)

Since Rick ≥ k, AA∗ is nonnegative, and Wt0 is k–dimensional, when we take the trace
of Equation 2.1.2, divide by k, and make the substitutions of 1.6.4, we get an equation
that satisﬁes the hypotheses of Theorem 1.5. Thus for all t ∈ [t0, tmax) ,

Trace ˆS (t) ≤ ˜λ (t) .

1
k

(2.1.3)

For t ∈ [t0, tmax) , set

Wt ≡ { J ∈ Λ | J (t) ⊥ V (t)} .

By combining 2.1.3 with Lemma 2.1 and the lack of singularities of Λ|(t0,tmax), we have

as claimed.

Trace (S|Wt)|t ≤ k · λ,

To prove Part 2, suppose that

{Wt0}⊥ (t1) = {Wt0}⊥ (t0) and Trace(cid:0)S (t1) |Wt0(cid:1) = k · ˜λ (t1)

for some t1 ∈ (t0, tmax) .

It follows from Equation 2.1.1 that

Writing

Trace ˆS (t1) = k · ˜λ (t1) .

ˆR for {R (·, ˙γ(t)) ˙γ(t)}h + 3AA∗,

we see from Theorem 1.5 that

Trace ˆS (t) ≡ k · ˜λ (t) and Trace(cid:16) ˆR(cid:17) ≡ k · κ

for all t ∈ [t0, t1] .

Our hypothesis that Rick ≥ k · κ implies that Trace {R (·, ˙γ(t)) ˙γ(t)}h ≥ k · κ. Com-

bining this with Trace(cid:16) ˆR(cid:17) ≡ k · κ and the fact that AA∗ is nonnegative, we see that

A ≡ 0. So

is independent of t, and Wt = Wt0 for all t. It follows that Λ splits orthogonally as

Wt ≡ { J ∈ Λ | J (t) ⊥ V (t)}

Λ ≡ Wt0 ⊕ V.

FOCAL RADIUS, RIGIDITY, AND LOWER CURVATURE BOUNDS

21

By Part 3 of Lemma 1.6, ˆS ≡ ˜λ · id and ˆR = κ · id. So it follows that Wt0 consists of

Jacobi ﬁelds whose restrictions to [t0, t1] have the form

J = ˜f E,

where E is a parallel ﬁeld and ˜f is the function from 0.0.2 that satisﬁes ˜f (t0) = |J (t0)| .
To prove Part 3, we suppose that Λ has no singularities on [t0, tmax) , so by Proposition

1.1, ˆS is deﬁned on [t0, tmax) . As above, Lemma 2.1 gives us that

Trace(cid:16) ˆS(cid:17)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t0

≤ k · ˜λ (t0) .

So by Part 1 of Lemma 1.6, ˆS ≡ ˜λ · id and ˆR = κ · id on [t0, tmax) . As before, our
hypothesis that Rick ≥ k · κ implies that Trace {R (·, ˙γ(t)) ˙γ(t)}h ≥ k · κ. Combining this
with ˆR ≡ k · κ and the fact that AA∗ is nonnegative, we see that A ≡ 0. So

is independent of t, and Wt = Wt0 for all t. It follows that Λ splits orthogonally as

Wt ≡ { J ∈ Λ | J (t) ⊥ V (t)}

Since ˆS ≡ ˜λ · id and ˆR = κ · id, as in Part 2, we have that Wt0 consists of Jacobi ﬁelds

whose restrictions to [t0, t1] have the form

Λ ≡ Wt0 ⊕ V.

J = ˜f E,

where E is a parallel ﬁeld and ˜f is the function from 0.0.2 that satisﬁes ˜f (t0) = |J (t0)| .
(cid:3)

The proof of Lemma Q has the added bonus of choosing Wt in terms of V (t) .

Corollary 2.2. Let V be as in the proof of Lemma Q. In Part 1 of Lemma Q, we can
choose the subspace Wt ⊂ Λ so that

Wt (t) ⊥ V (t) .

Remark 2.3. Notice that our proof of Lemma Q only requires that the radial interme-
diate Ricci curvatures along γ are bounded from below, that is,

sec ( ˙γ, Ei) ≥ k · κ

kXi=1

for any orthonormal set { ˙γ, E1, . . . , Ek} .

Remark 2.4. The proof above actually shows that Lemma Q is valid even when Λ has
singularities on (t0, tmax), as long as they lie in V. Indeed, Theorem 1.5 holds on intervals
where the function s is smooth. In our context, this happens as long as ˆS is well-deﬁned.
According to Proposition 1.1, ˆS is well-deﬁned at all times t where the kernel of the
evaluation map lies in V.

3. Second Fundamental Form, Focal Radius, and Lower Curvature

Bounds

In this section, we bound the second fundamental form of a submanifold in terms of a
lower curvature bound on the ambient manifold and the submanifold’s focal radius. In
particular, we prove Theorem P, which is a special case of the following result.

Theorem 3.1. For κ = −1, 0, or 1, let M be a complete Riemannian n–manifold with
Rick ≥ kκ, and let N be any submanifold of M with dim (N) ≥ k. Then for any unit

where {ei}k

Then ctκ is an odd function and satisﬁes limt→0− ctκ = −∞.

Let ΛN be the Lagrangian family along γv from Equation 0.0.10. If the conclusion is

subspace Wt1 ⊂ ΛN so that

Tr(cid:0)S|Wt1(cid:1) ≤ k · ctκ (α − FocalRadius (N) + t1) .

Since α − FocalRadius (N) < 0 and limt→0− ctκ = −∞, ΛN has a singularity by time
FocalRadius (N) − α. This is a contradiction because ΛN is nonsingular on the interval
(0, FocalRadius (N)).
(cid:3)

Proof of Theorem R. Let M be a complete Riemannian n–manifold with Rick ≥ 0, and
let N be any closed submanifold of M with dim (N) ≥ k and inﬁnite focal radius. Let
v be any unit normal vector to N. By replacing v with −v, if necessary, we may assume
that

Tr (Sv) ≤ 0.

(3.1.2)

FOCAL RADIUS, RIGIDITY, AND LOWER CURVATURE BOUNDS

25

As above, we let

ΛN ≡ (cid:8)J|J (0) = 0, J ′ (0) ∈ νγ(0) (N)(cid:9) ⊕(cid:8)J|J (0) ∈ Tγv(0)N and J ′ (0) = SvJ (0)(cid:9) ,
V ≡ (cid:8)J|J (0) = 0, J ′ (0) ∈ νγ(0) (N)(cid:9) , and
W ≡ (cid:8)J|J (0) ∈ Tγ v(0)N and J ′ (0) = SvJ (0)(cid:9) .

Let ˆS : H (t) −→ H (t) be as in Equation 1.1.1. Since the focal radius of N is inﬁnite,
ΛN has no singularities, and it follows from Proposition 1.1 that ˆS is deﬁned for all time.
From Lemma 2.1 and Inequality 3.1.2 it follows that

Tr(cid:16) ˆS (0)(cid:17) ≤ 0.

(3.1.3)

Since Rick ≥ κ and dim (N) ≥ k, it follows from the Transverse Jacobi Equation

(1.2.1) that Tr(cid:16) ˆR(cid:17) ≥ 0. Since ˆS is deﬁned for all time, 3.1.3 and Part 2 of Lemma 1.6

give us that ˆS ≡ ˆR ≡ 0. Hence from Equation 1.2.1, A ≡ 0. Thus t 7−→ Λ (t) splits
orthogonally into the parallel distributions

Λ (t) ≡ W (t) ⊕ V (t) ,

and every ﬁeld in W is parallel. Since we started with an arbitrary normal vector to N,
it follows that N is totally geodesic. Thus the argument above also applies to −v, and
Parts 1 and 4 are proven. Part 2 is obvious.

Part 3 follows by observing that exp⊥

isometry, so as in the proof of Cartan-Hadamard, exp⊥
5 follows from the fact that every ﬁeld in W is parallel.

in W. Since sec (γ ′

v, ·) are nonnegative.

Since RickM ≥ 0, it follows from the Gauss Equation that to prove Part 8, it suﬃces

to show that

hS (J) , Ji ≥ 0,

for all J ∈ ΛN and all t ≥ 0. Since ΛN (t) ≡ W (t) ⊕ V (t) is a parallel, orthogonal
splitting and hS (J) , Ji ≡ 0 for all J ∈ W, it suﬃces to show that

hS (J) , Ji ≥ 0

and hence from Lemma Q that ΛN has a singularity, which is contrary to our hypothesis
that N has inﬁnite focal radius.
(cid:3)

Part 2. Focal Rigidity

Let M be a complete Riemannian manifold M with Rick ≥ k, and let N be a closed
2 . Since each connected

submanifold of M of dimension at least k and focal radius π
component of N has focal radius π

2 , we may assume that N is connected.

In the second part of the paper, we prove Theorem G by showing that the universal
cover of M is isometric to the unit sphere or to a projective space with the standard
metric, with N totally geodesic in M.

In Section 4, we exploit the rigidity portion of Lemma Q to prove a rigidity result for
the Jacobi ﬁelds of ΛN (see Proposition 4.3). This allows us to prove, in Section 5, that
every ﬁrst focal point of N is regular in the sense of [27]. With this it follows rather
easily that F, the focal set of N, is a totally geodesic closed submanifold with focal radius
π
2 . We thus further the analogy between the pair (N, F ) and the dual sets in the proof
of the Diameter Rigidity Theorem. In particular, we establish, as in [22], that F (resp.
N) is the base of a Riemannian submersion from the unit normal sphere to any point of
N (resp. F ). In Section 5, we also show that if dim(F ) + dim (N) = dim (M) − 1, then
M has constant curvature 1.

Section 6 analyzes the case when M is simply connected. We show that if the codi-
mension of F (resp. N) is ≥ 3, N (resp. F ) is simply connected; hence the ﬁbers of the
Riemannian submersion to N (resp. F ) are connected.

All of the above allows us to complete the proof of Theorem G along the lines of the
proof of the Diameter Rigidity Theorem. In the sectional curvature case, the argument
can be concluded more rapidly. We prove that the diameter of the universal cover of M
is ≥ π
2 , and appeal to the Diameter Rigidity Theorem, after making a further topological
argument that rules out exotic spheres and nonunit metrics on Sn. We give the details
of this in Section 7. In Section 8, we complete the proof of Theorem G for intermediate
Ricci curvature.

4. The Distance from N

Throughout Sections 4—8 we assume that M is a complete Riemannian manifold with
Rick ≥ k, and that N is a connected, closed submanifold of M of dimension at least k
and focal radius π
2 .

FOCAL RADIUS, RIGIDITY, AND LOWER CURVATURE BOUNDS

27

In this section, we apply the rigidity statement in Lemma Q to prove Proposition 4.3,
which is a positive curvature analog of Theorem R. In particular, we conclude that the
radial sectional curvatures from N are all ≥ 1.

We start by reviewing the notion of horizontally homothetic submersions.

Deﬁnition 4.1. ([5], [6]) A submersion π : M −→ B of Riemannian manifolds is called
horizontally homothetic if and only if there is a smooth function λ : M −→ (0, ∞) with
vertical gradient so that for all horizontal vectors x and y

We also use the following result from [32].

λ2 hx, yiM = hDπ (x) , Dπ (y)iB .

Proposition 4.2. Let π : M −→ B be a horizontally homothetic submersion with
dilation λ and let r be a regular value of λ so that λ−1 (r) is nonempty. Then

is a Riemannian submersion.

For a unit speed geodesic γv that leaves N orthogonally at time 0, we set

TN ≡ (cid:8)J|J (0) ∈ Tγ(0)N and J ′ (0) = SvJ (0)(cid:9) , and

ΛN ≡ ZN ⊕ TN ,

(4.2.1)

where Sv is the shape operator of N determined by v, that is, Sv : Tγ v(0)N −→ Tγv(0)N,
is (∇·v)T N .

The ﬁrst consequence of FocalRadius (N) = π

2 is the following result, which holds even

if N is not closed.

Proposition 4.3. Let M be a complete Riemannian n–manifold, and let N be a sub-
manifold of M with focal radius π
2 and dim (N) ≥ k. Suppose that along each unit speed

2(cid:3) −→ M that leaves N orthogonally at time 0 we have Rick ( ˙γ, ·) ≥ k · κ,

3. Let g∗ be the metric on regN ⊂ ν (N) obtained from pulling back (M, g) via the
normal exponential map, and let π : regN −→ N be the projection of the normal bundle.
Then with respect to g∗, π is a horizontally homothetic submersion with scaling function
cos(dist(N0, ·)), where N0 is the 0–section of the normal bundle, ν (N) .
4. If c : I −→ N is a unit speed geodesic in N, and V is a parallel normal unit ﬁeld

5. With respect to g∗, every plane tangent to regN \N0 that contains X ≡ grad {dist (N0, ·)}

Proof. Parts 1 and 2 follow by combining Remark 2.3 with the version of Part 3 of
Lemma Q when κ = 1, t0 = 0, tmax = π

For Part 3, we let Z ∗
Observe that by Part 2,

grad {dist (N0, ·)} ⊕ Z ∗

N ⊕ T ∗

N

is an orthogonal splitting of T regN with respect to g∗. Since the vertical space of π
is spanned by grad {dist (N0, ·)} ⊕ Z ∗
N , the horizontal space of π with respect to g∗ is
spanned by T ∗
N . Since the ﬁelds of T ∗
N come from variations of geodesics that leave N0
orthogonally, they are π–basic. Part 3 follows by combining this with Part 1.

For Part 4, observe that Part 1 gives us that Φ is an immersion. Let II be the second

fundamental form of image (Φ) . By construction, ∂Φ

5. The Structure of the Focal Set

This section begins with a review of Hebda’s notion of regular tangent focal points
that generalizes a notion of Warner for conjugate points ([27], [45]). We next exploit
the rigidity in Proposition 4.3 to show that every tangent focal point at time π
2 is
regular. This allows us to apply a result of Hebda and conclude that our focal set
F ≡ exp⊥
that F has focal radius π
2 . We then further the analogy between the pair (N, F ) and the
dual sets in the proof of the Diameter Rigidity Theorem by showing that F (resp. N)
is the base of a Riemannian submersion from the unit normal sphere to any point of N
(resp. F ).

2(cid:1)(cid:1) is a smooth submanifold of M. The rigid structure also yields

N(cid:0)S(cid:0)N0, π

Deﬁnition 5.1. ([27], cf [45]) A tangent focal point v ∈ ν (N) is called regular if and
only if there is a neighborhood U of v so that every ray in ν (N) that intersects U has
at most one tangent focal point in U, not counting multiplicities. Otherwise v is called
singular.

Continuity of the curvature tensor implies that every v ∈ ν (N) has a neighborhood
U so that every ray meeting U has the same number of tangent focal points, counting
multiplicities. So if v is a regular tangent focal point, then every ray tu in ν (N) that
intersects U has exactly one focal point t0u, and the multiplicities of t0u and v coincide.
Thus regular tangent focal points have locally maximal order. Using this and ideas of
[45], Hebda showed the following.

Theorem 5.2. ([27], cf [45]) The set of regular tangent focal points is a smooth codi-
mension 1 submanifold of ν (N) that is an open, dense subset of the set of all tangent
focal points.

On regN ⊂ ν (N) , we set

X ≡ grad (dist (N0, ·)) .

Along a ﬁxed geodesic, focal points are isolated, so it follows that the set of regular,
ﬁrst-tangent focal points is an open, dense subset of the set of ﬁrst-tangent focal points.

It follows from the Gauss Lemma that ker(cid:0)D exp⊥
set of our N ⊂ M is S(cid:0)N0, π

2(cid:1) , it follows that ker(cid:0)D exp⊥

this with the Rank Theorem we get
Corollary 5.3. Let ˜Freg be the set of regular ﬁrst-tangent focal points, and let

N(cid:1)X ⊥ X. Since the ﬁrst-tangent focal
2(cid:1) . Combining

N(cid:1) ⊂ T S(cid:0)N0, π

Then Freg is a smooth submanifold of M that is open and dense inside of F.

Freg ≡ exp⊥

N(cid:16) ˜Freg(cid:17) .

Lemma 5.4. Let v ∈ ν (N) be a singular tangent focal point. For every neighborhood U
of v, there is a regular tangent focal point w ∈ U so that

dim(cid:0)ker(cid:0)D exp⊥

N(cid:1)w(cid:1) < dim(cid:0)ker(cid:0)D exp⊥

N(cid:1)v(cid:1) .

Proof. Let U be any neighborhood of v. Replacing U with a possibly smaller neighbor-
hood, we may assume that the total multiplicity of the focal points on each ray that

30

LUIS GUIJARRO AND FREDERICK WILHELM

intersects U is constant, and that the ray tv contains only one focal point in U. Since v is
singular, U contains a ray with more than one focal point w1 6= w2, which by hypothesis
is not the ray through v. Since the multiplicity of the focal points in tw1 ∩ U and tv ∩ U
is the same, it follows that

dim(cid:16)ker(cid:0)D exp⊥

N(cid:1)w1(cid:17) < dim(cid:0)ker(cid:0)D exp⊥
N(cid:1)v(cid:1) .

(5.4.1)

It might be that w1 is not regular; however, since 5.4.1 holds for some w1 in any neigh-
borhood of v, by repeating this argument a ﬁnite number of times, we get the desired
conclusion.

TFreg = nsin t E| E is parallel and tangent to Freg at time

2o .

4. Writing ΛN for the N–Jacobi ﬁelds along γ, we have orthogonal splittings

ΛN = TN ⊕ TFreg ⊕ Z and
ZN = TFreg ⊕ Z,

where ZN is as in Equation 4.2.1.

Proof. Part 1 is a consequence of the Gauss Lemma and the fact that F ≡ exp⊥
The space ΛN of N–Jacobi ﬁelds along γ are precisely the variation ﬁelds of variations
by geodesics that leave N orthogonally at time 0. Similarly, the space ΛFreg of Freg–
Jacobi ﬁelds along γ are precisely the variation ﬁelds of variations by geodesics that
arrive at Freg orthogonally at time π
2 . It follows from Part 1 that ΛN ⊂ ΛFreg. Since

dim (ΛN ) = n − 1 = dim(cid:0)ΛFreg(cid:1) , ΛN = ΛFreg. This proves Part 2.
Since γ has no focal points for N on (cid:0)0, π
γ(cid:0) π
2 − t(cid:1) has no focal points for Freg on (cid:0)0, π

2(cid:1) , it follows from Part 2 that γ −1 (t) =

Lemma 5.6. Freg = F.

Proof. We set

Fsng ≡ F \ Freg,

and suppose, by way of contradiction, that Fsng 6= ∅.

Let γreg and γsng be geodesics that leave N orthogonally at time 0 with

γreg(cid:16) π

2(cid:17) ∈ Freg and γsng(cid:16) π

2(cid:17) ∈ Fsng.

The idea of the proof is to examine how the splitting ZN = TFreg ⊕ Z behaves as
a sequence of γreg’s approaches γsng. In particular, by Lemma 5.5, TFreg is spanned by
constant curvature 1 Jacobi ﬁelds. By continuity, γsng inherits such a family, and this
forces π

sng (0) to actually be regular. The details follow.

By appealing to Lemma 5.4, we can assume that

For either γreg or γsng we have the four spaces of Jacobi ﬁelds, ΛN , TN , ZN , and Z.
We will distinguish the versions of the spaces along γreg from those along γsng with the
superscripts reg and sng. When no superscript is present, the statement applies to either
case.

Along γreg, Lemma 5.5 gives us an orthogonal splitting

Since this contradicts Inequality 5.6.6, the result is proven.

Lemma 5.7. F is a totally geodesic closed submanifold of M with focal radius π
2 .

We have F = Freg, so from Part 3 of Lemma 5.5,

Proof. Since Freg = F, it is a submanifold. Since F = exp⊥
follows from Part 2 of Lemma 5.5 that ΛN = ΛF . Therefore the focal radius of F is π

2(cid:1)(cid:1) , it is closed. It

TF =nsin t E| E is parallel and tangent to F at time

In particular, for J ∈ TF , J ′(cid:0) π

2(cid:1) = 0. So F is totally geodesic.

The next result will lead to the spherical rigidity portion of the conclusion of Theorem

G.

Theorem 5.8. M has constant curvature 1 if either of the following holds:
1. F is not connected.
2. dim(F ) + dim (N) = dim (M) − 1.

FOCAL RADIUS, RIGIDITY, AND LOWER CURVATURE BOUNDS

33

Proof. We have that exp⊥ : S(cid:0)N0, π
S(cid:0)N0, π

2(cid:1) −→ F is onto. So if F is not connected, then
2(cid:1) is not connected, and it follows that N is codimension 1 and has a trivial

normal bundle. Since

dim (F ) + dim (N) ≤ dim (ΛN ) = dim (M) − 1,

to prove Part 1, it is enough to prove Part 2.

In general, we have an orthogonal splitting of ΛN = TN ⊕ TF ⊕ Z along any one of
our normal geodesics. Since dim (TF ) = dim (F ), dim (TN ) = dim (N) , and dim(F ) +
dim (N) = dim (M) − 1, Z = 0, and our geodesic is spanned by constant curvature 1
Jacobi ﬁelds. Moreover,

TN = ZF and TF = ZN .

Combining this with Part 1 of Proposition 4.3, it follows that along a geodesic leaving
F orthogonally at time 0,

ZF = { sin tE | E is parallel} ,

(5.8.1)

and along a geodesic leaving N orthogonally at time 0,

on

ZN = {sin tE | E is parallel} .

It follows from Equation 5.8.1 that for all x ∈ F and all r ∈(cid:0)0, π
Similarly, it follows that for all x ∈ N and all r ∈(cid:0)0, π

|v| = r} ,

IIr (U, V ) ≡ g (∇U V, γ ′ (r)) ,

where γ leaves N orthogonally at time 0.

Combining 5.8.1, 5.8.2 and 5.8.5, we have for Y ∈ TN , and W ∈ ZN ,

IIr (Y, Y ) = |Y |2 tan (r)
IIr (W, W ) = − |W |2 cot (r) , and
IIr (Y, W ) = 0.

(5.8.6)
Now view Sn as a join, Sn = Sdim N ∗ Sdim F, and let ˜γ be a geodesic that leaves Sdim N
orthogonally at time 0. Setting ˜M ≡ Sn, ˜N ≡ Sdim N, and ˜F ≡ Sdim F, observe that
5.8.3, 5.8.4, 5.8.5, and 5.8.6 hold with M, N, and F replaced by ˜M , ˜N , and ˜F . Observe
further that Equations 5.8.3, 5.8.4, 5.8.5, and 5.8.6 together with the Gauss, Radial, and

34

Codazzi-Mainardi Equations ([33]) determine the curvature tensor of ˜M ≡ Sn. Similarly,
they determine the curvature tensor of M. Thus M has constant curvature 1.

Proof. The proofs are identical, except for notation . We give the details for Part 1.

Let γ be a geodesic that leaves N orthogonally at time 0. Then

γ(0) (N)(cid:1) = { J ′ (0) | J ∈ ZN } , and

Tγ ′(0)(cid:0)ν1
2(cid:17)
Dπγ(0) (J ′ (0)) = J(cid:16)π

(5.9.1)

for all J ∈ ZN .

Since TF ⊂ ZN , the splittings ΛN = TN ⊕ ZN = TN ⊕ TF ⊕ Z give us an orthogonal

splitting

ZN = Z ⊕ TF .

Combined with Equation 5.9.1 this gives an orthogonal splitting

Tγ ′(0)(cid:0)ν 1

γ(0) (N)(cid:1) = { J ′ (0) | J ∈ Z} ⊕ { J ′ (0) | J ∈ TF }

into the vertical and horizontal spaces, respectively, for πγ(0). Since dim (TF ) = dim (F ) ,
it follows from Equation 5.9.1 that πγ(0) is a submersion. By Part 1 of Proposition
4.3, with F playing the role of N, the restriction of Dπγ(0) to the second summand in
Equation 5.9.2 is an isometry. Thus πγ(0) is a Riemannian submersion.
(cid:3)

6. The Simply Connected Case

Let π : ˜M −→ M be the universal cover of M. Then each component π−1 (N) is a
2 and dimension at least k. In particular, ˜M contains a
submanifold with focal radius π
closed, connected, embedded submanifold with focal radius π
2 and dimension at least k.
So to prove Theorem G, it suﬃces to consider the case when M is simply connected and
N is connected.

In this section, we will combine our simply connected hypothesis with Hebda’s theorem

are connected. We start with a review of Hebda’s result.

Deﬁnition 6.1. (Hebda, [27]) Consider geodesics γ that leave N orthogonally at time
0. N has a very regular ﬁrst focal locus if the multiplicity of the ﬁrst focal point is

independent of γ and, in case the multiplicity is one, ker(cid:0)D exp⊥

tangent space to the tangent focal locus at every ﬁrst-tangent focal point.

N(cid:1) is contained in the

Along a geodesic that leaves our N orthogonally at time 0, the multiplicity of the

focal point at time π

2 is

dim ZF = dim (ΛN ) − dim TF

= dim (M) − 1 − dim (F ) ,

and hence is constant. Since the focal radius of N along every geodesic is π
2 , it follows
from the Gauss Lemma that our N has a very regular ﬁrst focal locus. Therefore, since
M is simply connected, we can apply the following result of Hebda. (See Theorem 3.1
in [27] and the ﬁrst line of its proof.)

Theorem 6.2. (Hebda, [27]) Suppose M is a connected, compact Riemannian manifold,
and N is a connected, compact submanifold having a very regular ﬁrst focal locus such
that the inclusion ι : N ֒→ M induces a surjection of fundamental groups.

If the multiplicity of the ﬁrst focal points of N is s − 1, then the ﬁrst focal locus F
of N in M is a submanifold of codimension s that coincides with the cut locus of N in
M. Moreover, the tangent cutlocus of N coincides with the ﬁrst-tangent focal locus of N,
and M is the union of two disk bundles

over N and F respectively, where

is a diﬀeomorphism.

M = DN ∪ϕ DF

ϕ : ∂DN −→ ∂DF

By combining transversality and Theorem 6.2 we get following.

Corollary 6.3. Suppose that M is simply connected.
1. If codim(F ) ≥ 3, then N is simply connected.
2. If codim(N) ≥ 3, then F is simply connected.

36

LUIS GUIJARRO AND FREDERICK WILHELM

Proof. The two statements have dual proofs. We give the details for Part 1.

Transversality gives us

π1 (M) ∼= π1 (M \ F ) ,
and by Theorem 6.2, M \ F deformation retracts to N.

(cid:3)

Similarly, the cut locus statements in Theorem 6.2 gives us

Corollary 6.4. If M is simply connected, then exp⊥

Lemma 6.5. Let M be simply connected.
1. If codim(N) ≥ 3, then the Riemannian submersions
ν1
x (N) −→ F, x ∈ N

2(cid:1) .
N is injective on B(cid:0)N0, π

have connected ﬁbers with positive dimension.
2. If codim(F ) ≥ 3, then the Riemannian submersions
ν 1
x (F ) −→ N, x ∈ F

have connected ﬁbers with positive dimension.

Proof. Since we have assumed that dim (F ) + dim (N) ≤ dim (M) − 2,

dim(cid:0)ν 1

x (N)(cid:1) = dim (M) − dim (N) − 1

> dim (F ) .

Thus the ﬁbers of ν1

x (N) −→ F have positive dimension.

By Corollary 6.3, F is simply connected if codim(N) ≥ 3. In this case, the long exact

homotopy sequence for ν1

x (N) −→ F, x ∈ N gives

π1 (F ) −→ π0 (ﬁber) −→ 0,

since π0 (ν1

x (N)) is trivial. Thus the ﬁrst conclusion holds. A similar argument gives us
(cid:3)

Since we have assumed that

dim (F ) + dim (N) ≤ dim (M) − 2,

(6.5.1)

codim(N) ≥ 2. Since dim (N) ≥ 1, we have codim(F ) ≥ 3. Combining this with Lemma
5.7, Corollary 6.4, and Lemma 6.5, we have

Theorem 6.6. Let M be a complete Riemannian n–manifold with Rick ≥ k and N any
closed, connected, submanifold of M with dim (N) ≥ k and focal radius π
2 . If M is simply
connected and not isometric to the unit sphere, then:
1.

dim (N) + dim (F ) ≤ n − 2.

2. N is totally geodesic and isometric to an even dimensional CROSS.
3. The focal set F of N is totally geodesic and is either a point or is isometric to an
even dimensional CROSS.
4. The normal exponential maps of N and F are injective on the π
zero sections of the normal bundles of N and F.
5. The conclusions of Proposition 4.3 hold with N replaced by F.

7. Rigidity in the Sectional Curvature Case

In this section, we complete the proof of Theorem D. Since M is simply connected, by
Part 4 of Theorem 6.6, the diameter of M is ≥ π
2 . So combining the Diameter Rigidity
Theorem with our dimension hypothesis 6.5.1 and Theorem 6.6 gives us the following.

Proposition 7.1. If M does not have constant curvature 1, then the following hold.
1. M is isometric to a compact, rank one, symmetric space or is homeomorphic to Sn.
2. N is even dimensional and isometric to the base of a Hopf ﬁbration.
3. F is either a point or is isometric to the base of a Hopf ﬁbration and is even dimen-
sional

To conclude the proof of Theorem D, we show that conclusions 2 and 3 are not

compatible with M being a topological sphere.

If M is a sphere, the long exact homology sequence of the pair (M, F ) gives

for q ≤ n − 1.

Use Theorem 6.2 to write

By excision,

Thus for q ≤ n − 1,

Hq (M, F ) ∼= H #

q−1 (F )

M = DN ∪ϕ DF .

Hq (M, F ) ∼= Hq (DN , ∂DN ) .

H #

q−1 (F ) ∼= Hq (DN , ∂DN ) .

(7.1.1)
By Proposition 7.1, F is either an even dimensional CROSS or a point, and N is an even
dimensional CROSS. It follows from Equation 7.1.1 that Hq (DN , ∂DN ) ∼= 0 if q is even
and ≤ n − 1. If q is odd and q + 1 ≤ n − 1, then the sequence of the pair (DN , ∂DN )
gives

0 = Hq+1 (DN , ∂DN ) −→ Hq (∂DN ) −→ Hq (N) = 0,

since N is an even dimensional CROSS. Thus

Hq (∂DN ) ∼= 0 if q is odd and ≤ n − 2.

Since N is isometric to the base of a Hopf ﬁbration with connected ﬁbers, dim (N) ≥ 2.
Since dim (N) + dim (F ) ≤ n − 2, we get n ≥ 4. So dim (∂DN ) ≥ 3. Since ∂DN is a
connected, compact, odd dimensional manifold, 7.1.2 implies, via Poincar´e duality, that
∂DN is a Z2–homology sphere of dimension ≥ 3 . Thus the Mayer–Vietoris sequence
with q ∈ {2, . . . , n − 2} yields

0 = Hq (∂DN ) −→ Hq (DN ) ⊕ Hq (DF ) −→ Hq (M) −→ Hq (∂DN ) = 0.

Since DN has the homotopy type of the CROSS N, and dim (M) ≥ dim (N) + 2 ≥ 4,
M cannot be homeomorphic to a sphere.

8. Rigidity and Intermediate Ricci

In this section, we complete the proof of Theorem G. This is achieved by analyzing
the radial geometry from N and F. Proposition 4.3, Lemma 5.5, and Lemma 5.7 give
us rigid radial geometry along the distribution spanned by the Jacobi ﬁelds in TN and
TF . To prove rigidity for the Z–Jacobi ﬁelds, we show, in Proposition 8.4, that as in
the proof of the Diameter Rigidity Theorem, there are enough other dual pairs in M to
force the Z–Jacobi ﬁelds to span projective lines. This is achieved via the next three
results, wherein the hypotheses that N is connected and M is simply connected are still
in force.

Either description shows A (p) is compact. Since both N and F have focal radius π

both descriptions show, via Corollary 6.4, that A (p) \ {F ∪ N} is a manifold. The ﬁrst
description shows that A (p) is smooth near N.

dim (A (p)) = dim F + dim (N) − 1 + 1.

Since A (p) = S(cid:0)p, π

2(cid:1) is a smooth submanifold, and every geodesic that leaves p has

cut point at distance π
2 from p, it follows from 1st–variation that every geodesic leaving
p arrives orthogonally at A (p) at time π
2 . This identiﬁes the unit tangent sphere at p,
Sp, with the unit normal bundle of A (p) , ν 1 (A (p)) . Combined with Proposition 8.1, it
follows that the focal radius of A (p) along any normal geodesic is greater than or equal
to π
(cid:3)

2 . So it follows from Theorem F that the focal radius of A (p) is exactly π
2 .
It follows that Theorem 6.6 applies with N p = A (p) and F p = p.
Next, we apply Propositions 8.1 and 8.2 to q ∈ A (p) and, with a further application

of Theorem 6.6, get the following result.

Returning N p = A (p) and F p = p, we now have the following reﬁnement of Proposi-

tion 4.3.

Proposition 8.4. Let γ be a unit speed geodesic that leaves N p orthogonally at time 0
and let ΛN p, TN p and ZN p be as in 4.2.1.

1. ZN p ⊕ TN p is a parallel, orthogonal splitting of ΛN p along(cid:0)0, π
2(cid:1) .

2. TN p and ZN p have the forms

TN p ≡ {cos tE| E is parallel and tangent to N p at time 0} ,

ZN p ≡ (cid:26) 1

2

sin 2tE| E is parallel and orthogonal to N p at time 0(cid:27) .

Proof. Apart from the second equation in Part 2, this is a repeat of Parts 1 and 2 of
Proposition 4.3. The second equation in Part 2 follows from Part 2 of Proposition 8.3.
Indeed, let γ be a unit speed geodesic from x ∈ N p to p. Choose q ∈ N p at distance π
2
from x, and apply Proposition 8.3 to q. It follows that γ ⊂ A (q) , and A (q) is a totally
geodesic CROSS. In particular, the Jacobi ﬁelds along γ have the indicated form if they
are tangent to A (q) . Since the normal space to A (q) along γ is spanned by a subspace
of TN p, the result follows.
(cid:3)

We ﬁnish the proof of Theorem G along the lines of the proof of Theorem 4.3 in [22]

by using Cartan’s Theorem (Theorem 2.1, page 157 of [15]).

Since Theorem 6.6 applies to N p = A (p) , there is a CROSS P with

and

dim (P ) = dim (M)

dim (ZN p) = dim (F) − 1,

where F is the division algebra that deﬁnes P.

Choose a point ˜p ∈ P. Since P is a CROSS, we have a Riemannian submersion

˜π ˜p : S˜p −→ A (˜p) ≡n x ∈ P | dist (x, P ) =

π

2o

that is isometrically equivalent to a Hopf Fibration. Since dim (ZN p) = dim (F) − 1, we
have, using [21] and [47], that ˜π ˜p is isometrically equivalent to

Let

πp : Sp −→ N p ≡ A (p) .

I : S˜p −→ Sp

be a linear isometric equivalence between ˜π ˜p and πp. Then we have a commutative
diagram

S˜p
↓ ˜π ˜p

A (˜p)

I−→ Sp

↓ πp
ˆI−→ A (p)

Since ˜π ˜p and πp are Riemannian submersions and I is an isometry, ˆI is an isometry.

Via the Cartan Theorem and Proposition 8.4, we see that ι ≡ expp ◦I ◦exp−1

˜p deﬁnes an
isometry between P \ A (˜p) and M \ A (p) that induces the isometry ˆI : A (˜p) −→ A (p) ,
and thus ι extends to an isometry P −→ M. This completes the proof of Theorem G.

Part 3. Conjugate Points in Quotients by Submetries

In this part, we prove Theorem H. We start, in Section 9, by establishing some basic
facts about holonomy for manifold submetries. In Section 10, we make the statement of
Theorem H precise by deﬁning variational conjugate points. Lastly, prove Theorem H.

9. Submetries and Holonomy

Throughout this section, we assume M is an Alexandrov space with curvature bounded

from below, π : M −→ X is a submetry, and γ : [0, b] −→ X is a geodesic.

The proof of Lemma 2.1 in [7] gives us the following.

Proposition 9.1. 1. Given any y ∈ π−1 (γ (0)) , there is a lift of γ starting at y.
2. If for some ε > 0, γ extends as a geodesic to [−ε, b] , then the lift in Part 1 is unique.

Part 2 allows us to deﬁne holonomy maps between the ﬁbers of π over the interior of

γ as follows.

Deﬁnition 9.2. Given any s, t ∈ (0, b) , we deﬁne the holonomy maps

Hs,t : π−1 (γ (s)) −→ π−1 (γ (t))

by

where ˜γx is the unique lift of γ so that ˜γ x (s) = x.

Hs,t (x) = ˜γx (t) ,

Proposition 9.3. If M is Riemannian and π is a manifold submetry, then for all
s, t ∈ (0, b) , Hs,t is a C ∞ diﬀeomorphism.

Proof. Choose ε0 > 0 so that [s − ε0, t + ε0] ⊂ (0, b) . By compactness we cover [s, t] by
ﬁnite number of open intervals of the form

(si − ιi, si + ιi) ,

were ιi is one-fourth of the injectivity radius of π−1 (γ (si)), and

s − ε0 = s0 < s1 < · · · < sm = t + ε0.

Let F i

t be the ﬂow of grad distπ−1(γ(si)). Then for r1, r2 ∈ (si, si+1 + ιi+1) , Hr1,r2 is
r2−r1 to π−1 (γ (r1)) and hence is a diﬀeomorphism onto its image
the restriction of F i
π−1 (γ (r2)). Since Hs,t is the composition of a ﬁnite number of the diﬀeomorphisms
Hr1,r2, it follows that Hs,t is a diﬀeomorphism.
(cid:3)

Remark 9.4. For γ and ˜γx as above, we deﬁne the holonomy ﬁelds along ˜γx to be
the Jacobi ﬁelds that correspond to variations by lifts of γ. If the Lagrangian subspace
Λπ−1(γ(s)) has no singularities on (s, t) , that is, if the evaluation map Eu : Λπ−1(γ(s)) −→
Tγ(u)M is one-to-one for all u ∈ (s, t), it follows that a ﬁeld J ∈ Λπ−1(γ(s)) is holonomy
if J (u) ∈ T π−1 (γ (u)) for some u ∈ (s, t) .

10. Submetries and Variational Conjugate Points

The following is the precise sense in which the term “conjugate point” is used in

Theorem H.

Deﬁnition 10.1. (Variational Conjugate Point) Let γ : [0, b] −→ X be a unit speed
geodesic in a complete, locally compact length space X. We say that γ (b) is variationally
conjugate to γ (0) along γ if and only if for some ε > 0, there is a continuous map
V : [0, b] × (−ε, ε) −→ X with the following properties.
1. For all t ∈ (0, b) ,

γ (t) = V (t, 0) .

2. There is a C > 0 and a t0 ∈ (0, b) so that for all suﬃciently small s 6= 0,

dist (γ (t0) , V (t0, s)) ≥ Cs.

3. For each s ∈ (−ε, ε) ,

is a unit speed geodesic on [0, b] .
4. At the end points,

t 7→ V (t, s)

dist (V (0, 0) , V (0, s)) ≤ o (s) and
dist (V (b, 0) , V (b, s)) ≤ o (s) .

In the Riemannian case, this coincides with the usual deﬁnition of conjugacy, so it
is not surprising that geodesics in Alexandrov spaces stop minimizing distance after
variational conjugate points.

Proposition 10.2. If X is an Alexandrov space with curvature bounded from below and
γ (b) is variationally conjugate to γ (0) along γ, then for all ε > 0, either γ does not
extend to [0, b + ε] or γ|[0,b+ε] is not minimal.

Proof. Suppose that γ|[0,b+η] is minimal and that η is small enough so that t0 ∈ (η, b − η) .
Since the comparison angle ˜∢ (γ (0) , γ (b) , γ (b + η)) is π, it follows that

∢ (γ (0) , V (b, s) , γ (b + η)) ≥ ˜∢ (γ (0) , V (b, s) , γ (b + η)) > π − o(cid:18) s
η(cid:19) ,
∢ (γ (t0) , V (b, s) , γ (b + η)) ≥ ˜∢ (γ (t0) , V (b, s) , γ (b + η)) > π − o(cid:18) s
η(cid:19) .

The previous two inequalities, together with a hinge comparison argument in the space

of directions of X at V (b, s) , gives

So by hinge comparison in X,

η(cid:19) .
∢ (γ (0) , V (b, s) , γ (t0)) ≤ o(cid:18) s
dist (V (t0, s) , γ (t0)) ≤ o(cid:18) s
η(cid:19) ,

but this is contrary to Part 2 of the deﬁnition of variational conjugacy.

(cid:3)

Lemma 10.3. Let π : M −→ X be a manifold submetry. Let γ : [0, b] −→ X be a
geodesic, and let ˜γ be a horizontal lift of γ that has its ﬁrst focal point for π−1 (γ (0)) at
b0 ∈ (0, b) . Then γ has a variational conjugate point at b0.

Proof. Since ˜γ has its ﬁrst focal point for π−1 (γ (0)) at b0, there is a variation

˜V : [0, b0] × (ε, ε) −→ M

of ˜γ by geodesics that leave π−1 (x) orthogonally at time 0 with

˜V (0, s) ∈ π−1 (x) ,

˜V (t, 0) is vertical for all t ∈ (0, b0) , then by Remark 9.4, ˜V is a

which is contrary to the second equation in 10.3.1. So for some t0 ∈ (0, b0),

is not vertical.

(10.3.2)

Projecting ˜V under π produces a variation V of γ in X by geodesics. It follows from

10.3.2 that for all suﬃciently small s 6= 0, there is a C > 0 so that

Since

dist (γ (t0) , V (t0, s)) ≥ Cs.

˜V (0, s) ∈ π−1 (x) ,

dist(cid:16) ˜V (b0, 0) , ˜V (b0, s)(cid:17) ≤ o (s) ,

and π is distance nonincreasing,

V (0, 0) = x and
dist (V (b0, 0) , V (b0, s)) ≤ o (s) .

Thus γ has a variational conjugate point at time b0.

(cid:3)

Proof of Theorem H. Suppose that

π : M −→ X

is a manifold submetry of a complete Riemannian n–manifold with Rick ≥ k and that for
some x ∈ X, dim π−1 (x) ≥ k. Let γ be a geodesic of X emanating from x. Suppose that

dim π−1 (x) ≥ k, then by Theorem G, the universal cover of M is isometric to the sphere
