ABSTRACT

The CoRoT space telescope observed nearly 160 000 light curves. Among the most outstanding is that of the young, active planet
host star CoRoT-2A. In addition to deep planetary transits, the light curve of CoRoT-2A shows strong rotational variability and a
superimposed beating pattern. To study the stars that produce such an intriguing pattern of photometric variability, we identiﬁed a
sample of eight stars with rotation periods between 0.8 and 11 days and photometric variability amplitudes of up to 7.5 %, showing
a similar CoRoT light curve. We also obtained high-resolution follow-up spectroscopy with TNG/SARG and carried out a spectral
analysis with SME and MOOG. We ﬁnd that the color dependence of the light curves is consistent with rotational modulation due
to starspots and that latitudinal diﬀerential rotation provides a viable explanation for the light curves, although starspot evolution is
also expected to play an important role. Our MOOG and SME spectral analyses provide consistent results, showing that the targets
are dwarf stars with spectral types between F and mid-K. Detectable Li i absorption in four of the targets conﬁrms a low age of
100− 400 Myr also deduced from gyrochronology. Our study indicates that the photometric beating phenomenon is likely attributable
to diﬀerential rotation in fast-rotating stars with outer convection zones.

1. Introduction

Dark surface spots are among the most prominent manifesta-
tions of solar and stellar activity. While they typically cover less
than one percent of the solar surface, their coverage fractions
on highly active stars can reach tens of percent (e.g., O’Neal
et al. 1996). Therefore, the surfaces of active stars are not al-
ways homogeneously bright. Starspots are ultimately caused by
the stellar magnetic ﬁeld, which is sustained by a stellar dynamo.
Although mostly spatially unresolved, the photometric and spec-
tral variability induced by rotating stellar surfaces can be used to
study the photospheres of active stars using techniques such as
Doppler imaging and light curve inversion (e.g., Rodono et al.
1986; Piskunov et al. 1990; Karoﬀ et al. 2013).

While long-term ground-based photometric observation
campaigns have long been used to study stellar activity (e.g.,
Järvinen et al. 2005; Oláh et al. 2006), the recent advent of
the space-based observatories CoRoT and Kepler (Baglin et al.
2006; Jenkins et al. 2010) oﬀers photometric data of unprece-
dented temporal cadence, continuity, and accuracy. Although the
main objectives of both missions are the search for extrasolar
planets and asteroseismological studies, the data are also ex-
tremely interesting in the context of stellar activity.

CoRoT-2A is among the most active planet host-stars known
to date. The star shows strong Ca ii H and K emission line cores
and X-ray emission as well as Li i absorption (Bouchy et al.
2008), suggesting an age of ∼ 300 Myr (Schröter et al. 2011).
The broad band light curve of the CoRoT-2 system is among the
most remarkable discoveries made by the CoRoT mission. In ad-
dition to deep transits caused by a bloated hot Jupiter (Guillot &
Havel 2011), the light curve shows photometric variability on

at least two distinct timescales (e.g., Alonso et al. 2008; Lanza
et al. 2009; Czesla et al. 2009; Huber et al. 2010). First, there
is clear evidence for rotational variability with a period of ∼ 4.5
days. Second, the amplitude of the rotation-induced pattern is it-
self variable, showing modulation reminiscent of a “beating pat-
tern” with a period of roughly 50 days. The general pattern re-
mained stable for at least 140 d, i.e., the duration of the CoRoT
observation. In their analyses of the spot conﬁguration, Lanza
et al. (2009) and Huber et al. (2010) reconstructed two active
longitudes on opposing hemispheres. The prominent photomet-
ric beating pattern is related to an alternation in the strength of
these active longitudes, in combination with diﬀerential rotation.
A similar photometric behavior, however, at a much longer
timescale, has been observed in the active late-type giant
FK Comae Berenices (e.g., Jetsu et al. 1993). Here, the pattern
has also been attributed to a pair of opposing active longitudes
of alternating strengths. A change in the center of activity, i.e.,
starspot coverage fraction, to the opposing hemisphere is known
as a “ﬂip-ﬂop” event (Jetsu et al. 1993; Oláh et al. 2006; Hack-
man et al. 2013). The discovery of such ﬂip-ﬂops in FK Com
was later supplemented with the observation of ﬂip-ﬂops in
nearly a dozen additional objects such as RS CVn-type stars
(e.g., Berdyugina & Tuominen 1998) and young solar analogs
(Berdyugina & Järvinen 2005). These observations have inspired
a number of theoretical works on the magnetic ﬁeld conﬁgu-
rations capable of reproducing the observed behavior (for an
overview see Berdyugina et al. 2006).

In this paper, we present the analysis of the CoRoT photom-
etry and follow-up high-resolution spectra of a sample of eight
CoRoT targets. The sample stars were selected by their photo-
metric variability which show a variation pattern similar to that

of CoRoT-2A. Our main observational objective is to ﬁnd com-
mon spectral characteristics and to establish a link between the
structure of the light curves and the stellar parameters. In par-
ticular, we are interested in the nature of the observed activity
pattern and whether this pattern is powered by diﬀerential rota-
tion. We also provide estimates of stellar age and distance in an
attempt to thoroughly characterize a larger number of stars with a
well-observed beating behavior to signiﬁcantly increase the data
base on which a theory of the underlying dynamo processes can
be established.

Our paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we describe the
sample selection and the photometric/spectroscopic data. The
analysis of the data is presented in Sects. 3 and Sect. 4. We dis-
cuss our ﬁndings in Sect. 5 and, ﬁnally, present our conclusions
in Sect. 6.

2. Observations
2.1. CoRoT photometry and target selection
CoRoT was a space-based 30 cm telescope dedicated to stellar
photometry (Auvergne et al. 2009). The satellite observed a few
thousand stars simultaneously with a temporal cadence of either
32 s or 512 s. The CoRoT mission was divided into several runs,
i.e., continuous observing periods pointed at a speciﬁc section of
the sky. CoRoT provided simultaneous three-color photometry
in a red, a green, and a blue channel (Auvergne et al. 2009). Al-
though the exact passbands of these channels remain essentially
unknown and are expected to vary between individual targets
and observations, they can still be used to test the plausibility of
physical assumptions. The sum of the signals registered in the
individual color channels is known as the “white” light curve.

We checked the light curves of about 11 000 stars situated
in CoRoT’s ﬁrst two Long Run ﬁelds (LRc01 and LRa01) for
variability and manually grouped the light curves into variabil-
ity classes. In the course of this analysis, we discovered about
40 objects with photometric characteristics similar to those of
CoRoT-2A. The light curves of these objects show a dominant
modulation between 2 and 11 days, which is most likely caused
by rotation. Additionally, there is a beating pattern found with
Pbeat (cid:29) Prot. On the rotational and beating timescale, the photo-
metric variability is typically a few percent.
Eight of the brightest targets were selected for spectroscopic
follow-up observations. These stars are listed in Table 1, along
with their available observational stellar parameters from the
Exo-Dat database1 (Deleuil et al. 2009). This database contains
photometric information from several catalog references. To pro-
vide uniform photometry, we give B, V, R, and I magnitudes

Notes. (a) Sampling changed during run

from the OBSCAT catalog. The spectral type and luminosity
class were derived using spectral energy distribution (SED) anal-
ysis (Deleuil et al. 2009). However, such assigned spectral types
and luminosity classes have to be used with some caution.

The light curves of our sample stars were observed in the
frame of the ﬁrst Long Run (LRa01), which lasted for about
131 d starting in October 2007. Later, a subsample of four targets
was reobserved during sixth Long Run (LRa06) with a duration
of 77 d, which began in January 2012; the observations are sum-
marized in Table 2. We used the N2-level pipeline data available
from the CoRoT Data Center2.

After acquiring the data we ﬁrst removed all data points
marked as “bad quality” by the CoRoT pipeline. Such points are
produced, for example, by the impact of high-energy particles
during CoRoT passages of the South Atlantic Anomaly. Second,
we normalized the light curves by dividing by the mean ﬂux. In
a ﬁnal step, we detrended the light curves to remove instrumen-
tal long-term trends by subtracting a linear model. The resulting
white light curves are shown in the upper panels of Figs. 1 – 3.
For the purpose of visualization, we rebinned the light curves ex-
cept that of CoRoT 102743567, which shows a particularly fast
pattern of variability. In particular, we binned by a factor of 8 for
light curves with a 512 s sampling rate and by a factor of 16 for
those with a 32 s sampling.

For all our light curves we estimated the photometric error,
σ. To this end, we divided the light curves into consecutive 0.5 d
long chunks, ﬁtted them using a second-order polynomial, and
determined the standard deviation of the residuals. The mean
standard deviation determined in the chunks was used as an er-
ror estimate on individual data points. The photometric error was
used as an input parameter when we utilized the generalized
Lomb-Scargle periodogram, which takes the photometric error
of the light curve into account (see Sect. 3.3).

origin of the CoRoT Julian day is 1 January 2000 12:00.00.

2.2. High-resolution spectroscopy

The spectroscopic observations of our target stars were carried
out between 8 and 12 December, 2011, with the SARG echelle
spectrograph, mounted on the 3.58 m “Telescopio Nazionale
Galileo” (TNG) on La Palma. We used the yellow cross-
disperser, which provides wavelength coverage in the 5200 −
7800 Å range with a gap of 150 Å at around 6200 Å caused by
the separation of the CCD detectors. Our setup yields a spectral
resolution of R ∼ 57 000.

During our observations, weather conditions were unsta-
ble with periods of excellent conditions interrupted by rather
cloudy phases. Therefore, seeing varied between 0.6 (cid:48)(cid:48) and 5 (cid:48)(cid:48).
As part of our observational campaign, we also obtained a so-
lar spectrum by observing the light reﬂected from the asteroid
15 Eunomia, which is required for a diﬀerential abundance anal-
ysis.

The data reduction was carried out using the REDUCE pack-
age developed by Piskunov & Valenti (2002). In particular, we
performed a bias correction, order deﬁnition, extraction of the
blaze function, and ﬂat ﬁelding. The treatment of scattered light
and hot pixels is described by Piskunov & Valenti (2002). The
wavelength calibration is based on ThAr-lamp reference frames

and was carried out using the WAVECAL extension of RE-
DUCE. Finally, a barycentric velocity correction was applied.

The majority of the targets was observed several times with
individual exposure times between 1800 s and 3600 s. To im-
prove the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), we averaged all spectra
taken for an individual target. For every spectrum we then com-
puted a S/N in the 6578 − 6580 Å interval, which contains no
strong spectral features. The resulting values are listed in Ta-
ble 3 along with the total integration time. Here, the S/N refers
to the averaged spectrum and although it varies across individ-
ual echelle orders and across the entire spectrum, these num-
bers broadly characterize the data quality. Finally, we manually
continuum-normalized the spectra by dividing the ﬂux by linear
functions, which were adjusted to have the same gradient as the
continuum.

3. CoRoT light curves analysis
In the upper panels of Figs. 1 – 3, we show the white-band
CoRoT light curves of our target stars. All light curves show
pronounced variability with peak-to-peak amplitudes of several
percent (see Table 4), which we attribute to a rotating and tem-
porally evolving starspot pattern.

is expected to be stronger than in the red channel. The opposite
is the case, when a spot rotates oﬀ the visible hemisphere.

In Fig. 4 we show an excerpt of the white-band light curve of
CoRoT 102577568 along with the ratio of the ﬂuxes recorded in
the red and blue channels. Clearly, both curves are anticorrelated.
A decrease in the white light ﬂux is accompanied by a reddening
of the star, which is consistent with spot-induced photometric
modulation. We veriﬁed that all investigated light curves show
this behavior. Alternatively, also pulsations could cause a sim-
ilar signature. Yet, typical photometric pulsation amplitudes on
solar-like stars fall far behind the observed modulation (< 10−5,
White et al. 2011). Therefore, we conclude that the modulation
in the light curves is indeed dominated by starspots with only a
marginal contribution from pulsations.

3.1. Starspot induced color changes

To assess the plausibility of the starspot hypothesis to explain the
observed variability, we examined the individual CoRoT color
channels and their relation. As observed on the Sun, we postulate
that the temperature of the starspots is lower than the remaining
stellar photosphere (e.g., Strassmeier 2009). Once a spot appears
on the visible hemisphere, the ﬂux in all three color channels de-
creases. However, because the spot is cooler, the stellar spectrum
appears redder. Therefore, the decrease in the blue channel ﬂux

3.2. Comparing LRa01 and LRa06

For half of our targets, two light curves observed about 4 years
apart are available (see Table 2). A visual comparison of the two
light curves allows to assess the temporal stability of the vari-
ability pattern. For CoRoT 102743567 and CoRoT 102778303
both the amplitude and appearance of the light curves remained
unchanged. For CoRoT 102656730 this may also be the case,
although it seems less clear. During the second, shorter observa-

3.3. Period analysis

Clearly, the light variation of our target stars shows some peri-
odic components. To study the variability in the frequency do-
main, we applied the generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram
(Zechmeister & Kürster 2009) to all light curves and show the
results in the upper subﬁgures in the lower panels of Figs. 1 – 3.
All periodograms show distinguished peaks at periods be-
tween about one and twelve days. We attribute these peaks and
the associated modulation in the light curve to rotating starspots
and, therefore, also identify the associated period with the stellar
rotation period. Generally, periodograms obtained from stellar
light curves observed in LRa01 and their counterparts observed
in LRa06 show similar structures. Peaks are generally less well
resolved in the LRa06 periodograms, because the observation is
only about half as long as the LRa01 data set.

The maximum-power periodogram peaks, which we call the
primary peaks, clearly show a tendency to be accompanied by
at least one nearby secondary peak. A particularly clear example
for such a double-peak structure is the periodogram of CoRoT
102656730 in Fig. 3. We adopted the prewhitening procedure
described by Reinhold et al. (2013) to extract closely spaced pe-
riods from the periodogram. The period associated with the pri-
mary peak was used as input for a sine, whose amplitude and
phase were ﬁtted to the data. After subtracting the resulting sine

tion, the amplitude is smaller and the pattern appears somewhat
more chaotic. However, this is compatible with an observation
in the low-amplitude phase of the beating pattern clearly visible
during the ﬁrst Long Run. The situation is similar for CoRoT
102791435, whose light curve appears more erratic, but still pe-
riodically variable during the later Long Run.

from the light curve, we computed the periodogram of the resid-
uals. Following Reinhold et al. (2013), we examined the period
space within 30 % of the primary period, mainly to avoid alias
periods. The resulting periodograms are shown in the lower sub-
ﬁgures in the lower panels of Figs. 1 – 3.

To determine the periods associated with the main and sec-
ondary peaks, we ﬁtted the peaks using a Gaussian proﬁle and
used the center as an estimate of the peak location. Additionally,
we interpret their FWHM as an error estimate on the location.
The resulting periods and errors are listed in Table 4, and the lo-
cations of the primary and secondary peak are indicated by black
vertical dots in Figs. 1 – 3.

In two out of the four stars observed twice by CoRoT we
found that the primary and secondary peaks in the LRa06 pe-
riodograms remained at essentially the same location (CoRoT
102743567 and CoRoT 102656730). Another case is CoRoT
102778303, where the secondary peak was already quite weak
in the LRa01 periodogram. The structure is mostly washed out
in the LRa06 periodogram. The situation is also diﬀerent for
CoRoT 102791435, where the secondary peak changed in po-
sition and power, possibly indicating considerable change in the
stellar spot conﬁguration.

In the case of CoRoT 102601465, CoRoT 102606401,
CoRoT 102763571 (all LRa01), and CoRoT 102791435
(LRa06) the power of the secondary peak is larger than that of
the primary peak. We were able to reproduce this behavior in
simulated light curves generated by the superposition of sines
with a continuum of periods. Nevertheless, we interpret the sec-
ondary peak and the associated period in terms of diﬀerential
rotation, but advise some caution in interpreting the result.

We note that the light curves of CoRoT 102606401 and
CoRoT 102601465 were also included in the study presented by
Aﬀer et al. (2012), who provide period measurements of almost
two thousand stars observed by CoRoT. For CoRoT 102606401
and CoRoT 102601465, they found rotational periods of 3.039
and 6.375 days, which are compatible with our results.

3.3.1. Differential rotation

The presence of two similar periods in the periodograms of
stellar light curves has been attributed to diﬀerentially rotating
starspots (e.g., Reinhold et al. 2013). Diﬀerential rotation is also
a possible explanation for the marked beating pattern in the light

curve of CoRoT-2A (e.g., Lanza et al. 2009; Huber et al. 2010)
and, therefore, also of our target stars.

On the Sun the observed latitude-dependent rotation velocity

(1)

can be parametrized by
Ω(Ψ) = Ωeq − ∆Ω sin2 Ψ = Ωeq
where Ψ denotes the latitude, Ωeq is the equatorial angular veloc-
ity, ∆Ω = Ωeq − Ωpole is the “absolute horizontal shear”, and α
is dubbed the “relative horizontal shear” (e.g., Snodgrass 1983;
Reinhold et al. 2013). Similar to the situation on the Sun we
may expect that the rotation rates of starspots depend not only
on latitude but also on their anchoring depth. Therefore, we cau-
tion that there may not be a unique relation between latitude and
starspot rotation rate as suggested by Eq. 1 and helioseismology
reveals that the rotation rate of the Sun depends on both latitude
and depth (Schou et al. 1998).

Therefore, if there are two measurements of Ω at two lati-

tudes Ψ1 and Ψ2, ∆Ω can be written as

∆Ω =

Ω(Ψ1) − Ω(Ψ2)
sin2(Ψ2) − sin2(Ψ1)

.

(2)

Remaining ignorant of Ψ1 and Ψ2, as is often the case, a lower
limit on |∆Ω| may be obtained by assigning Ψ1 = 0◦ and
Ψ2 = 90◦, which is of course a rather unsatisfactory choice. Fur-
thermore, attributing the larger rotational velocity measurement
to the equator (Ψ = 0◦), we ensure ∆Ω > 0 and thus, solar-like
diﬀerential rotation. As the angular velocity is related to the ro-
tation period P, via Ω = 2πP−1, a lower limit on the absolute and
relative latitudinal shear may be obtained by

Fröhlich et al. (2009) used a three-spot model to reproduce

of the slowest and the fastest diﬀerentially rotating spots. Ten-
tatively assigning the primary and secondary peaks identiﬁed in
the periodograms to diﬀerentially rotating spots, we used Eq. 3
to derive lower limits for the absolute and relative horizontal
shear and Eq. 4 to estimate the beating period; the values are
listed in Table 4.

In our data, the beating period is not always well deﬁned.
Some light curves do not fully cover a pattern as is the case for
CoRoT 102601465 (Fig. 1) and the deﬁnition of the start and
end of a cycle remains somewhat ambiguous. Nonetheless, the
calculated beating periods are in reasonable agreement with the
observed behavior in the light curves. In CoRoT 102743567, a
number of beating cycles with diﬀerent duration was observed
and the beating structure persisted over (or reappeared after)
four years. If attributable to diﬀerential rotation, this indicates
varying relative spot velocities. Given a temporally constant
and unique mapping between latitude and velocity, this implies
changing spot latitudes.

4. Spectral analysis
We determined the stellar parameters using two complemen-
tary approaches. First, the curve-of-growth based MOOG pack-
age (Sneden 1973) and, second, the “Spectroscopy Made Easy”
(SME) package presented by Valenti & Piskunov (1996), which
relies on direct spectral modeling. A visual inspection of the
spectra with regard to double line proﬁles did not reveal indi-
cations for binarity in any of our target stars.

4.1. Stellar parameter determination using MOOG
The stellar atmospheric parameters eﬀective temperature (Teﬀ),
surface gravity (log g), metallicity ([Fe/H]), and microturbulence
velocity (ξmic) were derived using the 2014 version of MOOG3
and a grid of 1D Kurucz ATLAS9 model atmospheres4 (Kurucz
1993). Additionally, we used PYSPEC, a Python interface to run
MOOG (Bubar & King 2010).

The analysis carried out by MOOG relies on a curve-of-
growth approach in which the stellar atmospheric equilibrium
is adjusted to match equivalent width (EW) measurements (see
also Gray (2005)). To adjust the equilibrium and ﬁnd the stellar
parameters, it is essential to measure the EWs of lines originating
from a single element in diﬀerent ionization states. For low-mass
stars, iron provides a plethora of Fe i and Fe ii lines distributed
over the optical spectral range; the Fe ii lines, however, are usu-
ally more scarce. Our choice of Fe i and Fe ii lines is based on
the ﬁnal line list5 provided by Sousa et al. (2008), who present
a total of 263 Fe i and 36 Fe ii lines, together with their excita-
tion potentials and oscillator strengths in the wavelength range
between 4500 Å and 6900 Å. We scrutinized their line list and
eliminated lines not usable in our analysis, for example, lines
suﬀering from heavy blending or lines for which we could not
derive adequate continua to obtain the EW. Additionally, we ne-
glected weak lines ((cid:46) 5 mÅ) and lines in wavelength intervals
with low S/N. The number of the remaining Fe i and Fe ii lines
of each star are listed in Table 5.

Equivalent widths were measured by ﬁtting the line pro-
ﬁles using a Gaussian. The local continuum was adjusted manu-

ally for each line to achieve the optimal normalization. To this
end, a solar model spectrum served as a comparison, which
we also used for the unambiguous line identiﬁcation in the ob-
served spectra. For CoRoT 102743567 no EWs could be deter-
mined from our spectra owing to extreme rotational broadening
(≈ 64 km s−1, see Sect. 4.2 and Table 5).

To minimize the impact of uncertainties in the atomic line
parameters and the characteristics of our particular instrumental
setup on the analysis, we carried out a diﬀerential abundance
analysis. Abundances are thus deﬁned with respect to the Sun

Therefore, we determined the EWs of our sample of spectral
lines in a solar spectrum, which we obtained by observing light
reﬂected oﬀ the asteroid 15 Eunomia with the same instrumental
setup. Our results are summarized in Table 5.

In MOOG, errors were estimated by studying various corre-
lations. In particular, the temperature value was varied until the
correlation between excitation potential and the Fe i abundances
reached the 1σ level. The error on the microturbulence veloc-
ity was derived equivalently by adapting it until the correlation
between the abundances and the reduced EWs6 reached 1σ. In
MOOG, the surface gravity is determined by minimizing the dif-
ference between the abundances obtained from the Fe i and Fe ii
lines. Yet, the abundances depend on the stellar parameters in-
cluding the surface gravity, which implies that the error on the
surface gravity depends on the surface gravity itself. Therefore,
the error had to be derived in an iterative process, which is de-
scribed in detail by Bubar & King (2010).

4.2. Stellar parameter determination using SME
Following the analysis with MOOG, we used the software pack-
age SME in version 2.1 to derive a complementary set of param-
eters. In contrast to MOOG, the technique employed by SME is
based on ﬁtting synthetic spectra to the observations. As input, a
grid of model atmospheres and an atomic line list are required.
For the latter we obtained atomic data from VALD37 (Kupka
et al. 2000) and, again, used ATLAS9 Kurucz atmospheres.

In our analysis, we used SME to ﬁt individual echelle orders
neglecting the low S/N edges of the orders and other unsuitable
spectral regions. The latter comprise sections with spectral lines
missing in the line list; regions aﬀected by cosmics, telluric lines,
airglow emission lines, and bands lacking any notable stellar ab-
sorption lines.

In our ﬁts, we used the values for Teﬀ, log g, [Fe/H], and ξmic
determined with MOOG as initial values for the SME ﬁt. For
the macroturbulence parameters, we assumed the solar value of
ξmac = 3.57 km s−1. In a ﬁrst ﬁtting step, we determined the ra-
dial velocity shift rad for all orders. We averaged the results in
the diﬀerent orders and interpreted the mean as the best estimate
of the stellar parameter and its standard deviation as a robust er-
ror estimate. Second, we determined the mean rotational broad-
ening parameter,  sin i, in the same manner. In a third step, we
ﬁtted ξmic and [M/H], and ﬁnally, ﬁtted Teﬀ and log g. During
the ﬁtting process, all parameters not currently ﬁtted remained
ﬁxed at their best-ﬁt values. The ﬁnal values are summarized in
Table 5. An example of a spectral interval of CoRoT 102656730
is shown together with the best-ﬁt synthetic spectrum in Fig. 5.

SME analysis

Notes. (a) For MOOG this is speciﬁcally the iron abundance. For SME, it refers to the metallicity pattern according to Grevesse et al. (2007).
(b) Number of Fe i and Fe ii lines used in the MOOG analysis.

the surface gravities found with SME are systematically higher
than those determined with MOOG. In particular, we ﬁnd diﬀer-
ences between 0.12 and 0.37 for all stars but CoRoT 102778303
for which the deviation reaches 0.88; however, the error is also
large. This star is the coolest in our sample, and we speculate that
the line EW measurements may be aﬀected by line blends, which
could also account for the rather low metallicity of −0.54 ± 0.05
found in our MOOG analysis. The direct ﬁtting approach im-
plemented in SME should minimize errors caused by blending
eﬀects or continuum determination.

Valenti & Fischer (2005) analyzed 1040 F, G, and K stars
using SME and obtained statistical errors of 44 K on Teﬀ, 0.06 on
log g, and 0.03 on the metallicity. In our analysis, we found that
the deviation among ﬁts to individual echelle orders were larger
than their estimates. Thus, our SME errors are likely dominated
by systematics.

All stars show substantial photometric variability, which we
attribute to starspots. Therefore, high starspot coverage frac-
tions are conceivable (e.g., Huber et al. 2010), although we cau-
tion that the data have not been taken simultaneously. A high
starspot coverage fraction may actually challenge the assump-
tion of a single-temperature photosphere, which tacitly underlies
our spectral analysis. It may also explain at least a fraction of the
diﬀerences between the MOOG and SME analysis.

4.4. Color, extinction, and distance

Ramírez & Meléndez (2005) provide metallicity-dependent rela-
tions between color and eﬀective temperature. Given the spectro-
scopically determined parameters and the observed B–V colors
(see Table 1), we can determine the B–V color excess. The re-
sulting intrinsic colors, (B–V)0, and excesses, E(B–V), are given
in Table 6. In the conversion, we applied the eﬀective temper-
atures and metallicities derived using MOOG (Table 5) and as-
sumed main-sequence stars. By substituting the upper and lower
error boundaries on the eﬀective temperature, we estimated that
the temperature-induced error on the color excess is on the order
of 0.03 mag.

Fig. 5. Segment of the observed (open squares) and synthetic spectrum
(solid line) of CoRoT 102656730. The grey shaded regions were used
to determine the stellar parameters.

In the case of CoRoT 102743567 we ﬁtted rad and  sin i
using only orders covering the strong Hα Balmer line and the
Na i doublet at ≈ 5990 Å. As initial values we calculated Teﬀ
photometrically using B–V colors as described in Sect. 4.4.
Furthermore, we chose typical values of main-sequence stars
for log g = 4.3 based on Gray (2005), solar metallicity, and
ξmic = 1.5 km s−1.

4.3. Stellar parameters obtained using MOOG and SME

In general, we ﬁnd good agreement between the eﬀective tem-
peratures, surface gravities, metallicities, and microturbulence
velocities derived with SME and MOOG. With a few exceptions,
the values agree within their respective uncertainties. However,

Notes. (a) The accuracy is typically 25 %, see text.

Notes. (a) Comparison with open clusters ; (b) Gyrochronological age

For the star CoRoT 102743567, for which no spectroscopic
parameters could be determined, we used the observed B–V
color of 0.39 mag to obtain an estimate of 7000 K for its eﬀec-
tive temperature, which points to an early F-type star. We note
that B–V= 0.39 mag requires a slight stretch of the Ramírez &
Meléndez (2005) calibration, which is formally only valid until
0.4. This result is consistent with the classiﬁcation as an A9III
type star by Sebastian et al. (2012) based on low-resolution spec-
troscopy.

We proceeded by converting the color excess into optical ex-
tinction by multiplying with R, for which we assumed a value
of 3.1 (Predehl & Schmitt 1995). Using Table 15.7 from Cox
(2000), we estimated absolute visual magnitudes based on our
eﬀective temperature determinations and, ﬁnally, calculated a
photometric distance estimate for our target stars, taking the ex-
tinction into account. Estimating an accuracy of ±0.5 mag for the
distance modulus, the typical error on the distances is 25 %.

4.5. Age of the sample stars

The Li i resonance doublet at 6707.76 Å and 6707.91 Å can be
used as an age estimator in young stars because lithium deple-
tion progresses quickly during the ﬁrst few hundred Myr (e.g.,
Soderblom 2010). In Fig. 6, we show the spectral region around
the Li i line for our sample stars. Unambiguous detections are
present for four out of the eight targets. In a quantitative anal-
ysis, we ﬁtted the line proﬁle by a Gaussian after adjusting the
local continuum, which is the main source of error.

Clear detections of the lithium line were obtained in
CoRoT 102577568, CoRoT 102601465, CoRoT 102606401,
and CoRoT 102763571. A formally signiﬁcant line detection is
also obtained in CoRoT 102778303. We caution, however, that
this result may require conﬁrmation at higher S/N. For CoRoT
102656730 and CoRoT 102791435 we derived upper limits on
the line EW. To this end, we generated artiﬁcial data sets be-
tween 6707.0 Å and 6708.5 Å assuming that no line is present
and ﬁtted them using the model including the absorption line.
Repeating this experiment 10 000 times, we determined the dis-
tribution of line EW measurements given that in reality no line
exists and give the 90 % cut-oﬀ as the upper limit for a signiﬁ-
cant detection. The ﬁnal EWs along with their 90 % conﬁdence
intervals are listed in Table 7.

The Li i line is known to be blended by an Fe i line at
6707.43 Å, which has not been taken into account in our ﬁtting.
Favata et al. (1993) studied the contribution of this iron line to
the overall EW. From their Fig. 1, we estimate that the contribu-
tion for a star with an eﬀective temperature of 5500 K should be

on the order of 10 mÅ and it decreases toward higher tempera-
tures. However, for CoRoT 102778303, at a temperature of about
4700 K, the Fe i line could have an EW of about 20 mÅ, which
is on the same order as our measurement. While this could indi-
cate that the line may indeed be attributable to iron, this seems
unlikely given the subsolar abundance pattern. All other detec-
tions should, if anything, be aﬀected on the 10 % level, casting
no doubt on the detection of the Li i line itself.

We proceeded by comparing the measured Li i line EWs with
measurements in open cluster members of well-known age. In
Fig. 7 we show our Li i EW measurements as a function of
eﬀective temperature along with results for the open clusters
Orion Ic (10 Myr, King 1993), NGC 2264 (10 Myr, Soderblom
et al. 1999), Pleiades (100 Myr, Soderblom et al. 1993b), Ursa
Major (300 Myr, Soderblom et al. 1993c), Hyades (660 Myr,
Soderblom et al. 1990), and Praesepe (660 Myr, Soderblom et al.
1993a). Based on their location in the plot, we arrived at the age
estimates provided in Table 7. Although the stars within an open
cluster are formed simultaneously, there is a considerable scatter
around a mean value in the measured EWs for a given eﬀective
temperature.

As a result of the well-established age-activity-rotation
paradigm (e.g., Skumanich 1972), rotation itself can be used as
an age indicator. We calculated the stellar ages of our target stars
based on gyrochronological models presented by Barnes (2007)
(their Eq. 3). In particular, we used the rotation period and the
intrinsic color (B–V)0 as input parameters. The errors were es-
timated using their Eq. 16. Again, we present our results in Ta-
ble 7.

Almost all of the gyrochronological estimates are consistent
with our estimates based on the comparison with open clusters.
The single exception is CoRoT 102778303 for which our clus-
ter comparison yields a higher age. However, the star CoRoT
102778303 is the coolest target in our sample, for which we
obtained eﬀective temperature estimates of 4840 ± 100 K with
MOOG and 4680 ± 150 K with SME. If the star is at the lower
edge of the indicated temperature range and the Li i line is not
heavily contaminated by iron, its age could also be compatible
with that of the Pleiades in Fig. 7.

5. Discussion
5.1. Stellar parameters and age determination
The results of our spectral analysis are broadly consistent with
the classiﬁcation provided by Exo-Dat (see Table 1).

All stars show gyrochronological ages between 111 and
418 Myr. Additionally, ﬁve stars show a Li i line supporting a

shear in the context of the sample presented by Reinhold et al.
(2013) in Fig. 8. Our values are clearly compatible with theirs,
although CoRoT 102601465 lies near their detection limit. In
particular, we were able to conﬁrm the trend of increasing rel-
ative shear, α, with higher rotation periods. CoRoT 102778303
and CoRoT 102791435, the coolest targets with the longest rota-
tion period which have been observed twice, show a considerable
shift in the value of the relative shear parameter between the two
observation epochs roughly four years apart. We attribute the
diﬀerence to both an uncertainty resulting from the prewhiten-
ing technique and the variability of the spot conﬁguration. The
results reﬂect the uncertainty that is expected in individual mea-
surements.

low age, although the detection in CoRoT 102778303 remains
somewhat ambiguous. Fast rotation and young age are compati-
ble with high levels of activity and large starspot coverage frac-
tions responsible for the photometric variability. Judging from
the derived spectroscopic parameters, our sample consists of
main-sequence stars. However, we ﬁnd that the luminosity class
for CoRoT 102778303 provided by Exo-Dat is probably inap-
propriate. The obtained log g and  sin i values, gyrochronology,
and rotation period indicate that CoRoT 102778303 should be
classiﬁed as a dwarf instead of a subgiant.

5.2. Differential rotation, spot evolution, and ﬂip-ﬂop events

Reinhold et al. (2013) studied diﬀerential rotation in a sample of
40 661 active stars observed by Kepler. In this sample, 77.2 %
of the targets show a second periodogram peak, which they at-
tribute to a second rotation period. Following their interpretation,
we show our results for the lower limit of the relative horizontal

Article number, page 10 of 12

The star CoRoT 102743567 is the earliest star and fastest
rotator in our sample. Combining a canonical radius of 1.5 R(cid:12)
for the star (Cox 2000) with the rotation period, we estimate an
equatorial rotation velocity, eq, of 90 − 100 km s−1. Based on
our period analysis, we further estimated a relative horizontal
shear parameter of 0.052. Ammler-von Eiﬀ & Reiners (2012)
studied diﬀerential rotation speciﬁcally in A- and F-type stars
using line proﬁle analyses. Although the authors ﬁnd that the
fraction of diﬀerential rotators decreases both as a function of
increasing temperature and rotation velocity, about 10 % of their
sample stars with  sin i ≈ 100 km s−1 show measurable diﬀer-
ential rotation. Among these stars, a relative horizontal shear of
≈ 0.05 seems too moderate (see their Fig. 10). Indeed, at 7000 K
an absolute horizontal shear, ∆Ω, of 0.6 rad d−1 may be expected,
which is also quite compatible with our value of 0.4 rad d−1. We
note that the spectral type of CoRoT 102743567 is in the range
of γ Dor-type variables, which show pulsations with periods on
the order of one day (Kaye et al. 1999; Zwintz et al. 2013). Al-
though it is still hard to unambiguously distinguish between the
rotational modulation and a potential pulsational component (cf.,
Zwintz et al. 2013), our results are consistent with dominant ro-
tational variation.

If the beating pattern is to be caused by diﬀerentially ro-
tating active regions (alone), its length also deﬁnes a minimal
lifetime for the associated regions, which in our case ranges be-
tween 15 d and about 150 d. Typical sunspot lifetimes are on the
order of or less than one month (Solanki 2003) and low- to mid-
latitude spots on rapidly rotating, young single main-sequence
stars also appear to have lifetimes of about one month (Hussain
2002). Therefore, the longer beating periods seem challenging in
terms of spot lifetimes. However, larger spots tend to have longer
lifetimes (Solanki 2003).

The light curves of our sample stars (Figs. 1 – 3) show a
similar pattern of variability to the light curves of ﬂip-ﬂop stars
such as the active giant FK Com or young solar analogs (see
Jetsu et al. 1993; Berdyugina & Järvinen 2005; Oláh et al. 2006;
Hackman et al. 2013). Flip-ﬂops are a speciﬁc manifestation of
spot evolution, characterized by alternating spot coverage on two
long-lived active longitudes on opposing hemispheres, which re-
quires “coordinated” spot evolution. While the origin of the phe-
nomenon may be entirely explained by the evolution of quasi-
stationary spots, diﬀerential rotation and latitudinal spot migra-
tion may also play a role or even largely explain the observations
(Jetsu et al. 1993; Hackman et al. 2013).

The surface reconstructions of CoRoT-2 have revealed spot
concentrations on active longitude on opposing hemispheres
(Lanza et al. 2009; Huber et al. 2010), which alternate in strength
on the beating timescale (≈ 50 d). Owing to the similarity of
the light curves studied here, a comparable behavior may be ex-
pected. While the behavior of the light curves analyzed here is
reminiscent of the ﬂip-ﬂop phenomenon, the ﬂip-ﬂop timescales

age. This is consistent with the high level of activity evident in
the light curves. Our sample shows a wide spread in spectral
types including F-, G-, and K-type stars, which all show a similar
photometric beating behavior. This suggests that all low-mass
stars with outer convection zones may produce a similar CoRoT-
2A-like light curve sometime in their early evolution.

observed so far are several years (e.g., Hackman et al. 2013). For
instance, Jetsu et al. (1993) detected only three ﬂip-ﬂop events
in a photometric data set spanning roughly 25 years. While spot
evolution certainly contributes to the morphology of the ob-
served light curves, the absence of diﬀerential rotation in our
late-type sample stars appears unlikely.

6. Summary and conclusion
We present a photometric and spectroscopic study of eight stars
with light curves showing photometric variability similar to that
of CoRoT-2A. The sample spans a wide range of spectral types
from early F- to mid K-type. The stellar parameters obtained
from our spectral analysis with SME and MOOG are gener-
ally consistent. For the fastest rotator in our sample, CoRoT
102743567, no detailed spectral analysis could be carried out.
For the remaining stars, we obtained surface gravities compat-
ible with that of main-sequence stars. Combining the spectro-
scopically derived eﬀective temperatures with the stellar colors,
we deduced distances corrected for interstellar reddening.

The light curve analysis showed large photometric ampli-
tudes of up to 7.5 % and short rotation periods between about
0.8 d and 11 d. We found the photometric variability to be con-
sistent with rotational modulation by starspots. In the majority of
cases, our periodogram analysis revealed two peaks correspond-
ing to similar periods, whose spacing is related to the beating pe-
riod. Attributing the two periods to diﬀerentially rotating spots
and combining the results with our spectroscopic measurements,
we ﬁnd results consistent with similar previous analyses of Ke-
pler light curves (Reinhold et al. 2013). However, in the end it
remains unclear whether the prominent pattern of variability ex-
hibited by the light curves is dominated by diﬀerential rotation
or spot evolution. In analogy to ﬁndings from photometric cam-
paigns of the active giant FK Com, we expect both eﬀects to play
a role.
Gyrochronological models show that all sample stars in our
sample are young dwarfs (100 − 400 Myr). In four stars, we also
found detectable Li i absorption, which also points toward a low
