Abstract

Recently, a combined approach of CFIE–BAE has been proposed
by authors for solving external scattering problems in acoustics. CFIE
stands for combined-ﬁeld integral equations, and BAE is the method of
boundary algebraical equation. The combined method is, essentially,
a discrete analogue of the boundary element method (BEM), having
none of its disadvantages. Namely, due to the discrete nature of BAE
one should not compute quadratures of oversingular integrals. More-
over, due to CFIE formulation, the method does not possess spurious
resonances.

However, the CFIE–BAE method has an important drawback.
Since the modelling is performed in a regular discrete space, the shape
of the obstacle should be assembled of elementary “bricks”, so smooth
scatterers (like spheres, cylinders, etc) are approximated with a poor

accuracy. This loss of accuracy becomes the bottleneck of the method.
Here this disadvantage is overcome. The CFIE–BAE method devel-
oped for regular meshing of the outer space is coupled in a standard
way with a relatively small irregular mesh enabling one to describe
the shape of the obstacle accurately enough.

Introduction

The problem of external acoustic scattering has recently been solved [17]
by means of the boundary algebraic equations method (BAE [15, 10, 19,

3

3]) and considering a combined-ﬁeld integral formulation (CFIE, [5, 13]).
The resulting method is, essentially, a discrete analogue of the boundary
element method (BEM) that inherits the good properties of BAE and the
advantages of CFIE, avoiding most of the BEM drawbacks. On the one hand,
no quadratures of oversingular integrals have to be computed due to the
discrete nature of BAE. On the other hand, the resulting integral equations
are free of spurious resonances due to the CFIE formulation [16].

However, the main drawback of the CFIE–BAE method is the reduction
of accuracy when smooth scatterers with curved surfaces such as spheres or
cylinders are considered. This is because the method is based on a regular
discretisation of the space (grid) and the obstacles must be approximated by
means of the closest brick-description.

Our goal here is to present a complementary formulation where the CFIE–
BAE method is coupled with some more versatile numerical technique in
order to deal with arbitrary shaped scatterers. This will typically be a thin
layer of ﬁnite elements (FEM) between the obstacle surface and a close grid-
shaped boundary that surrounds the obstacle. The FEM domain has on
the one side the boundary conditions corresponding to the scatterer and on
the other side the coupling with the CFIE–BAE. This acts as a method for
domain truncation and exactly imposes the radiation boundary conditions.
The coupling of numerical methods in order to maximize the beneﬁts and
reduce the disadvantages of each one has been often used. See for example
[21] where the FEM was complemented with a boundary integral method
to deal with radiation conditions or [12] where the stability conditions of
FEM–BEM couplings were studied.

Some more recent works on the FEM–BEM coupling applied to the scat-
tering of waves can be found, see for example [11, 6, 8]. However, to the best
of the authors knowledge, the coupling BAE–FEM has not been considered.
The method presented here can also be understood as an alternative to
impose the radiation boundary condition and truncate the computation of
domains. It has the added value that the obtained solutions are ‘exact’ in the
sense that no numerical artefact is required. In some popular alternatives
such as the perfectly matched layers (PML) the reﬂected waves are atten-
uated by means of a virtual damping medium placed in the surrounding of
the problem domain. It certainly diminishes the reﬂected waves but it is well
know that their parameters (i.e. complex wave number of the medium) must
be calibrated properly, see for example [14]. Moreover, evanescent waves can
remain undamped (see [20, 1]) and the quality of solution can be diminished

4

in some zones close to the layer such as the corners. The shape of the PML,
the thickness of the layer and the distance from the scatterer are important
aspects also for the quality of the solution and in order to derive the PML
equations. On the contrary, the approach presented here is more ﬂexible in
the sense that it is independent of the shape and the outer boundary can be
placed very close to the scatterer without aﬀecting the quality of the solution.
This will be illustrated later in Section 4.

In the remainder of the document, the formulation of the problem is
presented in Section 2 and the method is detailed in Section 3. Its properties
are shown with the numerical examples in Section 4 before the conclusions.
The parts of the development that are not essential have been grouped in the
appendices: some details of the derivation of BAE equations in Appendix A
and a proof of solvability in Appendix B.

2 Formulation of continuous and discrete prob-

lems

We consider a 2D of 3D external acoustic stationary problem. The scatterer
is approximated by a surface (or a curve) Γint. The inhomogeneous Helmholtz
equation

∆u + K2u = f

(1)

is assumed to be fulﬁlled in the medium. Variable u may correspond to
acoustical pressure or acoustical potential. We assume that the boundary is
acoustically hard (Neumann).

Function f represents the sources of the ﬁeld, i. e. a radiation problem
is studied.
If the sources are put on the surface Γint then one can study
radiation of wave by a vibrating boundary. Typically it is necessary to ﬁnd
directivity of the ﬁeld as the result.

We assume that the exponential factor of an outgoing wave has form of
exp{iKr} for big r, where r is the distance from the origin. We assume
that K has a vanishing positive imaginary part. Thus, an outgoing wave
should decay exponentially at inﬁnity. The same property (it is the radiation
condition) should be obeyed by any numerical approximation of u.

Split the domain external with respect to Γint into two subdomains Ωint
and Ωext (one inside another, see Fig. 1). The boundary between these do-
mains, Γext, should have a simple shape. For example, the interior of Γext

Fig. 1: Two domains and meshes (left), the uniform mesh (right)

should be a union of equal cubes/squares. This property will enable us to
apply the BAE method to Γext.

The boundary Γext does not correspond to any physical interface, but it
divides the space into two parts, which be treated numerically in a diﬀerent
manner. The wave process in domain Ωext will be modelled by the BAE
method, thus giving a boundary condition (an approximation of a DtN oper-
ator) on Γext. This boundary condition should establish the absence of waves
coming from inﬁnity on Γext. The internal domain Ωint will be treated by a
usual ﬁnite element method.

We assume that all sources lie inside Γext, i. e. belong to Ωint.
Consider the entire space Ω covered with uniform (periodic) mesh (see
Fig. 1, right). The mesh in our understanding consists of nodes and ﬁnite
elements (polygons or polyhedra). The set of all nodes belonging to the
uniform mesh will be denoted by ω, and the set of all ﬁnite elements by ω′.
Let ¯Ωint be a domain composed of some ﬁnite elements of the uniform mesh
¯ω′
int. Denote the set of nodes adjacent to these selected elements by ¯ωint.
Denote the set of nodes adjacent to the ﬁnite elements ω′
int of the
uniform mesh by ωext. The boundary nodes form the set γext = ¯ωint ∩ ωext.
Obviously, these nodes belong to Γext.

ext = ω′ \ ¯ω′

Now consider a non-uniform mesh deﬁned in domain Ωint (Fig. 1, left).
Denote the set of nodes of this mesh by ωint and the elements of this mesh
by ω′
int. The nodes of ωint lying on the boundary Γext should coincide with
γext, i. e. the uniform mesh on Ωext and the arbitrary mesh on Ωint should
form together a valid mesh on Ωint ∪ Ωext. Also, ωint ∩ ωext = γext.

6

Let equation

∆u + K2u = g,

(2)

valid in the entire space Ω, be approximated on a uniform mesh ω, ω′ using
the ﬁnite element method. Let the nodal values of u and g be denoted by
uj, gj. Write the approximation in the form

βj,kuk = gj,

j ∈ ω.

(3)

Xk∈ω

Assume that the coeﬃcients βj,k possess the following properties:

• βj,k 6= 0 only for nodes j and k adjacent to the same ﬁnite element;

• the matrix is symmetrical βj,k = βk,j ;

• since the mesh is periodical, the coeﬃcients do not change when the

pair of nodes is translated along the mesh.

Now consider the approximation of equation (1) in the domain Ωint ∪Ωext.

Let this approximation be written in the form

Xk∈(ωint∪ωext)

αj,kuk = fj,

j ∈ ωint ∪ ωext,

(4)

Let the coeﬃcients αj,k have the following properties:

• αj,k 6= 0 only for nodes j and k both belonging to the same ﬁnite

element;

• the matrix is symmetrical αj,k = αk,j ;

• αj,k = βj,k if j, k ∈ ωext and at least one of the nodes j, k belongs to

ωext \ γext.

The last point means that the discretisation (4) is uniform in Ωext.
Since the Neumann boundary condition is imposed on Γint, equation (4)
naturally incorporates the boundary condition. The method, though, can be
easily modiﬁed to the case of arbitrary boundary conditions.

Our aim is to present a method for solving (4). Equation (3) is auxiliary

for the method.

Expression (8) can be obtained from the BAE–CFIE method [17]. Here
we follow the consideration of [17]. Let Gm,n be an approximation of the
Green’s function of equation (2), i. e. let Gm,n obey equation

j, m ∈ ω,

(11)

and the radiation condition. Here δj,m is the Kronecker’s delta. Since (2) is an
equation on a uniform (periodic) mesh covering the whole space, function G
can be computed analytically by the Fourier transformation method. Matrix
Gm,n is symmetrical: Gm,n = Gn,m (see [17]). Introduce a notation

It follows from (13) that matrix B from (8) can be written as

B = (AC−1)T .

(16)

A known problem associated with the boundary integral equation is linked
with formula (16) or a similar one. Although B should exist for all temporal
frequencies, if no special measures are undertaken matrices A and C may be
singular. This feature is named spurious resonances. For example, if ν = 0
(12) corresponds to Kirchhoﬀ formulation of boundary integral equations.
The Kirchhoﬀ boundary integral equations are known to be prone to spuri-
ous resonances [18, 2, 7]. The CFIE approach is necessary to suppress the
spurious resonances. The case Im[ν] 6= 0 corresponds to a CFIE formulation.
A sketch of derivation of (13) and a proof of invertibility of C under some

general condition can be found in the Appendix.

Introduce the set of nodes γo belonging to ωext and neighbouring γext
(i. e. they are the nodes adjacent to the ﬁnite elements adjacent to nodes
from γext). The set γo is ﬁnite. By construction, γext ⊂ γo. The summation
in (14) and (15) can be held along γo instead of ωext.

Let us summarize the procedure of solving (4).

• The Green’s function Gm,n and values bm,n should be tabulated for

m ∈ γext, n ∈ γo.

• Matrices A, C should be calculated from (14), (15) for j, m ∈ γext.

• Matrix B should be found from (16).

• Equation (9) should be solved.

As the result of this procedure, one obtains the nodal values of ﬁeld uint
.
Thus, the near ﬁeld becomes known. To get the far ﬁeld, one needs to perform
an additional step of post-processing. Namely, for any m ∈ ωint

m = Xj∈γext

(17)

(18)

If node m is located far enough, asymptotic expressions for Gj,m and bm,j can
be found. Formula (18) provides the solution in the far ﬁeld (a directivity
can be taken from it).

It can be convenient to solve the whole problem at the same time and
avoid the explicit inversion of matrix C. One should consider a linear system
of equations where the unknowns are uext and uint that contain the nodal
values in γext and ωint respectively, and hext that contain the ﬂuxes hext
deﬁned in (6). The coupled linear system of equations is

where A and C are the matrices deﬁned in (14) and (15), Aint is the matrix
obtained from (5) which is typically the usual FEM matrix, 0 is a null matrix,
I the identity and Π the projector matrix deﬁned in (10) (rows for the nodes
in γext and columns for the nodes in ωint). The force vector includes f from

4 Numerical results

The eﬃciency of the numerical method is illustrated in a two-dimensional
problem with circle-shaped scatterer (see Fig. 2(a)). It has analytical solu-
tion that is used as reference. The scatterer has a curved surface. This is
important in order to demonstrate the improvement caused by the better
geometry description of the FEM layer (coupled model) with respect to a
staircase approximation based on the regular grid (use of only BAE [17]).

The force, which represents the imposed normal derivative of the variable
u at the contour, is chosen in order to generate a scattered wave described
by means of only one cylindrical harmonic. The nodal values of the force
vector are

fi = cos (Nϕi) ,

i ∈ γint

(20)

11

The angle ϕ and the radius R of the circle are shown in the sketch of Fig. 2(a).
N is related with the spatial frequency of the imposed force, N waves exist
over the circle. The expression of the scattered ﬁeld on the circle surface is

Diﬀerent error types play an important role in the numerical solution
of this problem: i)interpolation and dispersion error of the scattered ﬁeld;
ii)error in the description of the oscillatory force imposed on the scatterer
surface; and iii)geometry error in the approximation of the scatterer shape.
Error types i) and ii) are related with the number of nodes per wave length
of the scattered ﬁeld or the imposed force, respectively. Error type iii) is
related with the curvature of the scatterer. Each error type can be the
dominant error source depending on the frequency range and the geometrical
or material parameters of the model.

The mesh in Fig. 2(b) is designed in order to have a transition zone
between the circle (boundary Γint) and a closed grid shape. It is forced to
be thin in order to use the minimum number of ﬁnite elements. This mesh
has nodes ωint and elements ω′
int. The nodes over the internal boundary γint
are placed exactly on the circle (equally distributed). The force vector is null
for nodes not belonging to γint. The nodes on the external boundary γext
are considered in the BAE part of the problem. The mesh is built with the
GMSH software [9].

The error is measured as

(22)

where ‘num’ is the numerical solution and ‘exact’ the solution obtained with
(21).

In all the examples the grid spacing is h = 1. If nothing else is speciﬁed,
the mean ﬁnite element size is also h = 1 and the layer of ﬁnite elements that
surrounds the circle has an approximate external radius of Rext = R + h.

Fig. 3(a) shows the error evolution with respect to the dimensionless
wavenumber Kh for several cylindrical scatterers of diﬀerent size and the

harmonic N = 0. In all the cases the slope of the error curve is close to 2.
This is the expected result for the interpolation error of linear ﬁnite elements
where e = θh2, with θ a constant value [4].

It is observed that the numerical error has a diﬀerent lower bound for each
curve. This value is larger for smaller scatterers (with a more pronounced
curvature compared to the element size) due to the geometry error of the lin-
ear ﬁnite element approximation of the circular shape. This error is invariant
with respect to the wavenumber of the problem because it only depends on
the relationship between the element size and the curvature of the circle.

The geometry error is comparatively not important for large values of
dimensionless wave number (Kh ≈ 0.3 − 1.0) where the interpolation and
dispersion error of the scattered ﬁeld is dominant. On the contrary, geom-
etry error becomes dominant at low frequencies when the scattered ﬁeld is
oscillating with a larger spatial wave length. As an example, consider the
circle of radius R = 3h where the exact curved piece of surface that con-
tributes to each node is ds ≃ 2πR/n = 0.94247781 (n = 20 elements around
the circle Γint). Its equivalent ﬁnite element length is 0.93860679 which is
slightly diﬀerent.

For all this, it can be seen in Fig. 3(a) how the theoretical convergence
slope is lost for Kh < 0.4 in the circle of radius R = 3h and for Kh < 0.15

13

in the circle of radius R = 10h. The circle of radius R = 30h is not sensitive
to the geometrical error in the studied frequency range.

The inﬂuence of the spatial wavenumber of the imposed force for a scat-
terer of radius R = 10h is shown in Fig. 3(b). There are 64 nodes on the
circle. The imposed force describes N complete waves around the circle.
Consequently, there are: 64, 32 and 16 nodes per excitation wave length in
the harmonics N = 1, 2, 3 respectively. This amount of nodes is related with
the precision in the computation of the force vector.

In the results of Fig. 3(b) two diﬀerent zones can be clearly distinguished:
large wavenumbers where the interpolation and dispersion error in uext is
dominant and low frequencies where the error due to the force description is
more important. Each curve has a limit wavenumber K for which the error
in the solution becomes more or less constant and cannot be reduced with
a decrease of Kh. This limit value of the wavenumber K is related with the
number of the harmonic N: Kh ≃ 0.4 for N = 3, Kh ≃ 0.3 for N = 2, and
Kh ≃ 0.18 for N = 1. The curve corresponding to N = 0 is not aﬀected by
the error in the description of the force because it is constant all around the
scatterer.

Fig. 4 illustrates which is the eﬀect of reducing the ﬁnite element size

only on the circle (increase the number of nodes in γint) and not on the BAE
contour (the number of nodes on γext remains constant). The element size on
Γint is σh, with σ = 0.25, 0.5 and 1. The results are shown for two circles with
radius R = 3h and R = 10h. The improvement is more important for the case
R = 3h which is more sensitive to the geometry error at small wavenumbers.
The reduction of the ﬁnite element size around the scatterer reduces the error
in the whole frequency range. However, a lower bound (frequency invariant)
is found for each σ which shows again that it is due to approximation of the
scatterer geometry and not due to the proper interpolation of the scattered
ﬁeld.

Fig. 4: Inﬂuence of the ﬁnite element size around the scatterer for two dif-
ferent radius of the scatterer: (a) R = 3h; (b) R = 10h.

Fig. 5 shows the eﬀect of the ﬁnite element mesh truncation. First, the
boundary Γext is placed at several distances: R + h, R + 5h and R + 10h
with a circular scatterer of radius R = 10h. It can be seen how the results
are almost insensitive (or without clear meaningful trend) to the truncation
distance. This is important because it allows the use of the thinnest ﬁnite
element mesh around the scatterer, only conditioned by scatterer shape and
meshing procedures. The use of a small mesh contributes to the reduction
of computational costs. On the one hand, there are less unknowns. On the
other hand, the range of required values of the discrete Green’s function is

15

smaller.

Fig. 5(b) shows a comparison between the case when the ﬁnite element
layer is used (‘FEM+BAE’) and the case when it is not considered (‘Only
BAE’). In this second case the circular shape of the scatterer is approximated
by means of a staircased geometry, deﬁned by the closest grid (as it was
done in [17]). One can observe the improvement caused by the description of
the scatterer geometry by means of triangular ﬁnite elements comparatively
to a grid approximation of the circle. The diﬀerence is larger for higher
wavenumbers. But the slope or general trend is similar.

Fig. 5: Inﬂuence of the domain truncation in the quality of the solution for a

5 Conclusions

A numerical technique to deal with scattering problems has been presented.
On the one hand, it can be understood as a complement to the CFIE–BAE
method where a FEM layer is placed around the scatterer in order to better
approximate its shape and reduce the geometry error. On the other hand, it

16

can be understood as the use of BAE in order to exactly impose the radiation
boundary condition in a FEM model.

It is shown how the resulting method keeps the properties of ﬁnite ele-
ments. Since linear triangles are considered for the FEM layer, order two
convergence is observed. This behaviour is only truncated at very low values
of dimensionless wavenumber Kh by the geometrical error in the discretisa-
tion of the scatterer shape or the approximation of the force vector.

The coupling with FEM largely reduces the numerical error of BAE solu-
tions and helps to overcome its main drawback in problems involving curve-
shaped scatterers. This was caused by the staircase approximation of that
shapes. That shapes are now approximated by means of standard ﬁnite el-
ements without loosing any of the good properties of BAE for scattering
problems: no need to compute boundary integrals (which are usually singu-
lar in other methods such as BEM), non-singularity of the problem even for
the spurious eigenfrequencies of the scatterer and exact representation of the
domain truncation.

A Appendix A. Derivation of equations (17)

and (13)

First, derive (17). Formally the proof can be written as follows. Consider
the expression

On the one hand, due to (6)

uext
j αext

j,k Gk,m

Xj,k∈ωext

Xj,k∈ωext

uext
j αext

j,k Gk,m = Xk∈ωext

hkGk,m.

(23)

On the other hand, due to (12),

Xj,k∈ωext

uext
j αext

j,k Gk,m = Xj∈ωext

uext
j (δj,m + bj,m)

(24)

If m ∈ ωext, combining the expressions 23 and 24, obtain

uext

m = Xj∈γext

(hext

j Gj,m − uext

j bj,m).

(25)

17

After substitution uext
only for the solution uext

j = uint

j

for j ∈ ωext get (17). Note that (25) is valid

j

obeying the radiation condition.

However, this method cannot be applied directly, since the summation is
held over an inﬁnite set of nodes ωext. In [16] one can ﬁnd a reﬁned procedure.
One should truncate the area Ωext, say, by a large square/cube, and apply
(23), (24) to the truncated mesh. Then one should consider the limit of the
size of the square/cube growing to inﬁnity. The radiation condition obeyed
by uext
and Gj,m guarantee that the integral over the outer boundary of the
sphere/cube vanishes.

j

Now apply matrix αext

m,n to (25):

Xm∈ωext

uext
m αext

m,n = Xm∈ωext Xj∈γext

(hext

j Gj,m − uext

j bj,m)αext
m,n.

(26)

Here the summation over m causes no problem, since for each n it is held only
over the neighbors of n, where the coeﬃcients αext
m,n are non-zero. Changing
the order of summation in (26) and taking into account (6), get

hext

n = Xj∈γext hext

j Xm∈ωext

Gj,mαext

m,n − uext

j Xm∈ωext

bj,mαext

m,n! .

(27)

Now multiply (27) by an arbitrary complex number ν with a non-zero imag-
inary part and add to (25). The result is (13).

B Appendix B. On invertibility of C

The invertibility of C depends on details of realization of the ﬁnite element
method, so here we can prove a general but relatively weak theorem:

If a homogeneous Dirichlet problem on Ωext has no non-trivial solutions,

then matrix C is invertible.

A homogeneous Dirichlet problem on Ωext is as follows: Find a function

wj obeying equation

αext

m,jwj = 0,

m ∈ (ωext \ γext),

Xj∈ωext

boundary condition

wj = 0,

j ∈ γext,

18

(28)

(29)

and the radiation condition.

The uniqueness of solution of a homogeneous Dirichlet problem can be

proven in many particular cases.

The proof of the theorem is analogous to that of [16]. Assume that all
coeﬃcients βm,n and αext
j,m are real. Let matrix C be not invertible. This
means that there exists a non-zero vector vj, j ∈ γext such that vC is a zero
vector, i. e.

Xj∈γext

vjGj,m = ν Xj∈γext

vj(cid:0)δj,m − Gj,mαext
j,m(cid:1) ,

m ∈ γext.

(30)

Introduce a “single-layer potential” on the

uniform mesh ω:

Gm,jvj,

m ∈ ω.

(31)

This function obeys equation (28) and the radiation condition by construc-
tion. Note that

wm = Xj∈γext

Gm,jwj.

vm =Xj∈¯ω

(32)

(33)

(34)

Thus, (30) can be written in the form

wm = ν Xj∈¯ωint

βint
m,jwj,

m ∈ γext,

where

βint

m,n =(cid:26) βm,n

βm,n − αext

m,n otherwise

if m or n belongs to ¯ωint \ γext

Note that βint

m,n 6= 0 only if m, n ∈ ¯ωint. Note also that

Xj∈¯ωin

βint

m,jwj = Xj∈¯ωin

Consider a combination

βm,jwj = 0

m ∈ (¯ωint \ γext).

(35)

w∗

mβint

m,nwn

Xm,n∈¯ωint

where ·∗ denotes complex conjugation. Using (33) and (35) one can obtain
two representations for this combinations:

Xm,n∈¯ωint

w∗

mβint

m,nwn = ν −1 Xm∈γext

w∗

mwm = (ν ∗)−1 Xm∈γext

w∗

mwm.

(36)

19

Thus, we can conclude that

wj = 0,

j ∈ γext,

(37)

and wj is a solution of the homogeneous Dirichlet problem. It is non-trivial
on ωext, since equations (32) and

βint
m,jwj = 0,

m ∈ γext,

(38)

Xj∈¯ωint

(following from (33)), are valid.
