The new generation of solar instruments provides better spectral, spatial, and temporal resolution for a better understanding
of the physical processes that take place on the Sun. Multiple-component proﬁles are more commonly observed with these
instruments. Particularly, the He i 10830 Å triplet presents such peculiar spectral proﬁles, which give information on
the velocity and magnetic ﬁne structure of the upper chromosphere. The purpose of this investigation is to describe a
technique to eﬃciently ﬁt the two blended components of the He i 10830 Å triplet, which are commonly observed when
two atmospheric components are located within the same resolution element. The observations used in this study were
taken on 2015 April 17 with the very fast spectroscopic mode of the GREGOR Infrared Spectrograph (GRIS) attached
to the 1.5-meter GREGOR solar telescope, located at the Observatorio del Teide, Tenerife, Spain. We apply a double-
Lorentzian ﬁtting technique using Levenberg-Marquardt least-squares minimization. This technique is very simple and
much faster than inversion codes. Line-of-sight Doppler velocities can be inferred for a whole map of pixels within just a
few minutes. Our results show sub- and supersonic downﬂow velocities of up to 32 km s−1 for the fast component in the
vicinity of footpoints of ﬁlamentary structures. The slow component presents velocities close to rest.

1 Introduction

The spectral window around the He i 10830 Å triplet has
often been used to study the magnetic properties and dy-
namics in the solar chromosphere. The height of formation
of this triplet lies in the upper chromosphere (Avrett et al.,
1994). It comprises three transitions, which take place be-
tween the lower 23S 1 level and the upper 23P2,1,0 level.
However, two transitions are blended and therefore only
two spectral lines are observed. Generally, the blended line
at ∼10830.30 Å is called “red” component, while the non-
blended line at 10829.09 Å is called the “blue” component.

The wavelengths were taken from the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST).1

Of special interest are the strongly redshifted He i pro-
ﬁles, which have been reported by several authors (e.g.,
Muglach et al., 1997; Muglach & S¨utterlin, 1998; Penn
& Kuhn, 1995). Commonly observed are two atmospheric
components located within the same resolution element
(Lagg et al., 2007). These “dual ﬂows” were reported for the
ﬁrst time by Schmidt et al. (2000) and have an easyly recog-
nizable spectral pattern with two or more peaks next to the
red component of He i. One of the peaks is often subsonic
while the other reaches supersonic velocities. At the average
formation temperature of the He i triplet, velocities close to
10 km s−1 correspond to the sound speed (Lagg et al., 2007).
From now on we will label the proﬁles, which clearly show

dual ﬂow components of the He i triplet as the slow (the one
close to rest) and fast (redshifted with respected to the slow
one) components.

Several studies reported on dual or multiple-peak He i
proﬁles in diﬀerent phenomena on the Sun, e.g., Teriaca
et al. (2003) in two ribbon ﬂares, Sasso et al. (2011, 2007)
during a C2.0 ﬂare, Lagg et al. (2007) during an emerging
ﬂux process in an active region, or Aznar Cuadrado et al.
(2005, 2007) in active and quiet-Sun regions. All of them re-
ported supersonic velocities of the fast component between
40 and 90 km s−1. Lagg et al. (2007) suggested that these
dual ﬂows are formed in extremely ﬁlamentary structures
and that their origin might be related to the magnetic ﬁeld.
It is expected that these proﬁles provide information on two
diﬀerent heights in the atmosphere.

Several inversion codes are able to synthesize and in-
vert the Stokes proﬁles of the He i 10830 Å triplet, for ex-
ample, the He-Line Information Extractor code (HELIX+,
Lagg et al., 2009, 2004), the HAnle and ZEeman Light
code (HAZEL, Asensio Ramos et al., 2008), or the Milne-
Eddington Line Analysis using a Numerical Inversion En-
gine (MELANIE, Socas-Navarro, 2001). These codes in-
fer the physical parameters such as, e.g., the line-of-sight
(LOS) velocity and the vector magnetic ﬁeld, among others.
Usually these inversion codes require considerable compu-
tation time. In this paper, we present a simple and very fast
technique to infer the LOS velocities for single and double-
peaked proﬁles. Thus, the information present in the po-
larized Stokes parameters is disregarded. In particular, we

2 Observations

Our two-component ﬁtting code was applied to one data
set acquired with the 1.5-meter GREGOR solar telescope
(Denker et al., 2012; Schmidt et al., 2012) at Observato-
rio del Teide, Tenerife, Spain. An emerging ﬂux region
(EFR) located at heliographic coordinates S19 and W4
(µ ≡ cos θ = 0.97) was observed on 2015 April 17 be-
tween 08:16 UT and 09:18 UT. Several instruments and
telescopes were involved in this campaign. We will concen-
trate on the GREGOR Infrared Spectrograph (GRIS, Colla-
dos et al., 2012).

For the ﬁrst time the instrument was operated in the
very fast spectroscopic mode (no polarimetry) in the He i
10830 Å spectral region. Typically, in polarimetric mode
several integrations reduce the noise in the spectra but also
prolongate the cadence of the scans. The fast mode relies
on a single integration and accepts higher noise in exchange
for an improved cadence. The standard deviation σ = 3.3%
of the normalized quiet-Sun continuum in the wavelength
range 10835.8 – 10837.1 Å for all spectra in the scan gives
an estimate of the noise level, which will slightly increase
for darker features like pores.

The spectral window of about 18 Å comprised the pho-
tospheric Si i 10827 Å line, the chromospheric He i 10830 Å
triplet, the photospheric Ca i 10834 and 10839 Å lines, and
several telluric lines among other weaker spectral lines. The
spectral sampling was δλ = 18.03 mÅ pix−1, and the num-
ber of spectral points was Nλ = 1010. The slit was by
chance in parallel to two small pores belonging to the EFR
(see Fig. 1). The pixel size along the slit was ∼0.′′136, thus
covering a length of 66.′′3. For each position of the slit, the
integration time was t = 100 ms with only one accumula-
tion. This allowed for very fast spectroscopic scans cover-
ing an height of 24.′′12 (with 180 steps and a step size of
∼0.′′134) in only ∼58 s. During roughly one hour of obser-
vations (62 min), the GREGOR’s altitude-azimuthal mount
introduced an image rotation, which had to be corrected
(Volkmer et al., 2012). The total rotation angle for the pe-
riod of observation was 22.3◦. However, the image rotation
for each map is small (never larger than 0.4◦) and therefore
negligible.

In total 65 scans were taken covering an area of 66.′′3 ×
24.′′12. Nevertheless, only one map (08:42–08:43 UT) with
abundant two-component proﬁles will be presented in this
work (see Fig. 2). The data were taken under good see-
ing conditions with real-time corrections provided by the
GREGOR Adaptative Optics System (GAOS, Berkefeld
et al., 2012). Simultaneous multi-wavelength observations
were carried out with additional
instruments including
the GREGOR Fabry-P´erot Interferometer (GFPI, Denker
et al., 2010; Puschmann et al., 2012) at the GREGOR tele-
scope and the CRisp Imaging Spectro-Polarimeter (CRISP,
Scharmer et al., 2008) installed at the Swedish Solar Tele-
scope (SST, Scharmer et al., 2003) located at Observatorio
Roque de los Muchachos, La Palma, Spain. An overview

of all the involved FOVs is shown in Fig. 1 after alignment
with a continuum image of the Helioseismic and Magnetic
Imager (HMI, Scherrer et al., 2012; Schou et al., 2012) on-
board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO, Pesnell et al.,
2012). The analysis of the full data set and an investigation
of the dynamics related to the EFR are deferred to a forth-
coming publication.

2.1 Data reduction

Dark and ﬂat-ﬁeld corrections were applied as part of the
data reduction. The proper continuum of the GRIS spectra
was derived by comparing the average quiet-Sun spectrum
IQS(λ) with that of a Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS,
Neckel & Labs, 1984), which was convolved with a Gaus-
sian to take into account the degradation of the observed
spectrum by straylight (see Allende Prieto et al., 2004, for a
description of the procedure). The average quiet-Sun proﬁle
was computed in an area where the He i absorption was al-
most absent. Common fringes were removed by multiplying
every spectrum by the ratio between the equivalent quiet-
Sun mean proﬁle and the quiet-Sun mean proﬁle I ′/IQS.
Dust particles along the slit and other bright artifacts had
to be removed from the data by using an additional ﬂat
ﬁeld based on the science data assuming that the granulation
was uniform and isotropic. Abnormal intensity peaks were
found along some spectra due to the bad pixels on the detec-
tor chip. The peaks were detected by calculating the wave-
length derivative of the spectrum of each pixel and search-
ing for absolute values above a suitable threshold. Abnor-
mal intensities were then replaced by an interpolated value
between the previous and the next pixels.

The wavelength calibration was carried out using the
two telluric lines located next to the He i 10830 Å triplet.
An area of the quiet Sun was chosen to compute an average
intensity proﬁle. A direct comparison between the separa-
tion of the two telluric lines of the averaged intensity proﬁle
and the atlas proﬁle of the Fourier Transform Spectrometer
(Neckel & Labs, 1984) provided the dispersion (18.03 mÅ
pix−1). The ﬁrst telluric line at 10832.108 Å was then used
as the wavelength reference. In addition, the wavelength
scale was corrected for solar orbital motion and rotation,
Earth’s rotation, and the solar gravitational redshift. (see ap-
pendices A and B in Kuckein et al. 2012).

The fast component is blended by a telluric line for high
LOS velocities. Therefore, the telluric line was removed
from our spectra. To accomplish this task we averaged all
spectral proﬁles from the map to compute a mean inten-
sity proﬁle. We assumed that the telluric line has a constant
wavelength, i.e., it does not shift along the wavelength axis
at any time. The telluric line was ﬁtted in the spectral range
of 10831.48–10832.56 Å with a single Lorentzian proﬁle.
Hence, we have computed a synthetic telluric proﬁle. The
telluric line was then removed by dividing each spectrum by
the synthetic proﬁle. A smooth transition of the spectrum at
the location where the telluric line started was assured by
forcing the continuum in the line wings of the telluric line

the local continuum before removing the telluric line.

Figure 2 shows a slit-reconstructed continuum intensity
map (top) and a line-core intensity map of the red He i com-
ponent (using the minimum of the line for each spectrum)
normalized to the local continuum intensity Icore/Ilc (second
from top).

3 Method

Most of the He i 10830 Å intensity proﬁles show the ex-
pected two spectral lines, which comprise the blue and red
components. However, a few percent of these proﬁles, in
our data set around 3%, shows a clear signature of a fast
component in the He i triplet (see the contours in Fig. 2). As
a ﬁrst approach we assume that all proﬁles have only one
component. Hence, we use a single Lorentzian proﬁle to ﬁt
all He i proﬁles:

F = 1 −

u =

x − A1

with

where A0 is the amplitude, A1 the peak centroid, A2 the
half-width-at-half-minimum (HWHM), and the equation is
set to unity to normalize the synthetic intensity continuum.
The proﬁles were ﬁtted using the Levenberg-Marquardt
least-squares minimization (Mor´e, 1977; Mor´e & Wright,
1993) , where the MINPACK-1 software package was im-
plemented in IDL by Markwardt (2009). An advantage of

linking proﬁles and positions. Note that dual-ﬂow compo-
nents are hardly discernible in the ﬁrst (violet) and last (red)
proﬁles. Bottom: decomposition of the dual-ﬂow proﬁles

using this routine is that it is possible to impose an upper
and lower bounding limit for each free parameter of Eq.
1 independently. As a ﬁrst approach, we retrieved suitable
limits by ﬁtting the mean quiet-Sun proﬁle. The limits were
then modiﬁed to increase the accuracy of the ﬁts. The ﬁt-
ted wavelength range is automatically adjusted depending
on the amplitude of the spectral proﬁle. The larger the am-
plitude of the line the broader the spectral range. Since the
dual-ﬂow proﬁles are systematically redshifted we did not
include the blue component in the analysis.

The LOS velocities inferred with the single Lorentzian
ﬁts are shown in Fig. 2 (bottom). Positive velocities are re-
lated to downﬂows (red) while negative velocities (blue)
represent upﬂows. Note that double-peaked proﬁles, i.e.,
dual-ﬂow He i proﬁles, are not well ﬁtted with a single
Lorentzian proﬁle. Since the wavelength is given on an
absolute scale, the wavelength reference for the LOS ve-
locities was set to 10830.30 Å, which corresponds to the
average laboratory wavelength of the He i red component
(10830.25 Å and 10830.34 Å respectively, from the NIST
database). Figure 2 also shows the equivalent width (second
from bottom) obtained from the single-Lorentzian ﬁts.

The next step concerns ﬁtting the dual-ﬂow proﬁles with

a double-Lorentzian proﬁle:

where A0,3 are the amplitudes, A1,4 are the centroids, and
A2,5 are the HWHM of each Lorentzian, respectively. Due
to the very short computation time (a few minutes), all spec-
tral proﬁles were ﬁtted again with two Lorentzians. How-
ever, in the future we will adapt the code to only ﬁt the two-
component proﬁles.

An adaptive wavelength range was not used this time.
We chose two diﬀerent wavelength ranges depending on the
position of the line core of the He i red component. This ig-
nored the He i blue component from the selected wavelength
range. Therefore, if the line core of the He i red component
was located below 10830.49 Å, then the wavelength range
was [−0.83, +1.73] Å with respect to the line core. Other-
wise, if the position of the line core was > 10830.49 Å, then
the wavelength range was [−1.37, +1.73] Å with respect to
the line core.

The initial estimates of the ﬁt parameters A0–A5 were
based on the single-Lorentzian ﬁts and on the location of
the deepest line core of the dual-ﬂow components. The peak
centroid of the fast component is always more redshifted
than the slow component. The peak centroid of the slow
component is always at rest. The amplitudes A0 and A3 are
both initially set to the amplitude inferred from the single-
Lorentzian ﬁt, but are allowed to vary in the course of the
ﬁtting. The parameters A2 and A5 have a ﬁxed value of the
HWHM of 0.32 Å (mean HWHM values of all the proﬁles
ﬁtted with a single Lorentzian).

In order to localize the dual-ﬂow proﬁles, diﬀerent types
of these proﬁles were manually selected and then corre-
lated with all the proﬁles of the map. The wavelength range
for this correlation was between [10829.50–10832.56] Å. In
our particular case, we have selected more than 70 clearly
distinguishable dual-ﬂow proﬁles. Weak dual-ﬂow proﬁles
like, for instance, the ﬁrst violet and red (too small ampli-
tude) synthetic proﬁles shown in Fig. 4, were not selected
because they are too weak to clearly identify the fast compo-
nent. The median value of the correlation of all proﬁles were
used as a threshold. Hence, only proﬁles which showed a
larger correlation factor than 0.98% were treated as two-
component proﬁles. The contours in Fig. 2 encompass these
proﬁles. Developing an automatic algorithm to select the
dual-ﬂow proﬁles remains as future work.

4 Results

Some examples to illustrate the quality of the ﬁtting method
are shown in Fig. 3. All proﬁles are also marked in Fig. 2.
Proﬁle ‘a’ represents a common quiet-Sun proﬁle with a
LOS velocity close to zero (−0.01 km s−1). An example of a
proﬁle with a large equivalent width (472.4 mÅ) is shown in
panel ‘b’. It arises from a dark ﬁlamentary structure in the
chromosphere (see Fig. 2). However, the LOS velocity is
rather small and only reaches −0.3 km s−1 (upﬂow). Proﬁles

‘c’–‘f’ represent diﬀerent types of dual-ﬂow proﬁles. In par-
ticular, proﬁle ‘c’ was selected because of its deep line core,
i.e., higher absorption. The LOS velocity of the fast compo-
nent (solid green line) was about 14.8 km s−1 while the slow
component (solid blue line) only showed about 2.2 km s−1.
Proﬁles ‘d’ and ‘e’ are located near the footpoints of the
ﬁlamentary structure. The latter had one of the largest in-
ferred velocities of the fast component (∼28.1 km s−1). The
remaining proﬁle ‘f’ presents two components with similar
amplitudes. The fast component reached a LOS velocity of
about 21.5 km s−1.

The normalized frequency distribution of the LOS ve-
locities belonging to the He i fast component is shown in
Fig. 5. Velocities are in the range of 1–32 km s−1. The dis-
tribution is clearly double-peaked. The maxima are located
close to 7 km s−1 (subsonic) and 16 km s−1 (supersonic),
respectively. However, two distinct populations cannot be
identiﬁed in the FOV, either because the statistical sample
is too small or sub-/supersonic ﬂows are transitory in a con-
ﬁned space. Our normalized frequency distribution is simi-
lar to the one reported by Aznar Cuadrado et al. (2007) in
magnetic ﬁeld-free areas.

We traced the distribution of the dual-ﬂow proﬁles along
a given slit position. The slit position was chosen close to
the footpoints of the ﬁlamentary structure and next to the
pore. The rainbow-colored bar in Fig. 2 shows the location
of the proﬁles. For an easy inspection, the colors in the color
bar are associated to the colors of the 44 proﬁles shown
in Fig. 4. We do not plot the observed proﬁles to avoid a
crowded display. Instead, Fig. 4 shows the synthetic pro-
ﬁles computed from the inferred parameters of the double-
Lorentzian ﬁts. One interesting observational feature seen
in the top panel of Fig. 4 is that the ﬁrst proﬁles (violet

proﬁles) only have the slow component. However, once we
enter the area of the footpoints (turquoise-green proﬁles) a
clearly fast component appears. The shifted proﬁles next to
the pore exhibit the strongest redshifts (green-yellow pro-
ﬁles) but possess the smallest amplitudes. The bottom panel
of Fig. 4 shows the individual Lorentzian proﬁles, which
yield the dual-ﬂow proﬁle shown in the top panel. Blue col-
ors always show the slow component while red colors show
the fast component. The slow component is always station-
ary around the reference laboratory wavelength 10830.30 Å,
whereas the fast component is always redshifted reaching
values of up to 10831.40 Å in the line core.

Random and systematic errors can inﬂuence the mea-
surements. Using the noise estimate (σ = 3.3%) based on
continuum intensity variations (see Sect. 2.1) and the ﬁt pa-
rameters from Eqns. 1 and 2 for single Lorentzian proﬁles,
mock spectra are created and analyzed in the same way as
the observed data. The linear correlation coeﬃcient for am-
plitude and HWHM is ρ = 0.99 and that for the velocity
is ρ = 0.94. However, higher Doppler speeds are underes-
timated. The 3σ-uncertainties for amplitude, velocity, and
HWHM are 2.2%, 210 m s−1, and 1.17 pm, respectively,
whereas the mean values and the shape of the distributions
are barely aﬀected. These random errors also apply to the
double-Lorentzian ﬁts, which are however additionally in-
ﬂuenced by systematic errors. Dual-ﬂow proﬁles imply high
velocities for the fast component. Therefore, the slow com-
ponent of the He i red component will be blended with the
fast component of the He i blue component.

Using the ﬁt parameters of Eqns. 3 and 4 for the red He i
doublet and scaling them appropriately for the blue line of
the He i triplet, mock spectra are generated to obtain an er-
ror estimate. The aforementioned blend mostly impacts the
blue wing of the slow component of the He i red compo-
nent, which leads on average to a −300 m s−1 zero point
oﬀset for the velocity and a 3σ-uncertainty of 1.24 km s−1.
On average the amplitude of the slow component is over-
estimated by 8% with a 3σ-uncertainty of about 27%. In
principle, these systematic errors can be reduced either by
ﬁtting the entire He i triplet or by appropriately modeling the
He i triplet’s blue line when ﬁtting the red doublet. In sum-
mary, random and systematic errors are suﬃciently small to
allow a scientiﬁc interpretation of the 2D maps of physical
parameters (for example those in Fig. 2) and of dual-ﬂow
He i spectral proﬁles.

5 Conclusions and outlook

In this paper we introduce a simple and rapid technique for
determining the velocity of multiple atmospheric compo-
nents within a single spatial pixel. This technique produces
good ﬁts and gives reasonable velocity values, suggesting
that after some further tests it can be applied to additional
data. For example, an implicit assumption is that the He i
line is always optically thin in the wavelength range of the
telluric line and has to be tested.

We presented GRIS observations of an EFR containing
two small pores. The observations were complemented with
simultaneous imaging spectropolarimetry acquired with the
GFPI in the photospheric Fe i 6302 Å line. The FOV for the
broad-band images is shown in Fig. 1 (red box). In addition,
simultaneous observations with CRISP were carried out.
Several full spectropolarimetric scans of the photospheric
Fe i 6173 Å line and the chromospheric Ca ii 8542 Å line
were taken with a FOV of 54′′

×54′′ (blue box in Fig. 1).

The remaining task will be to extract all the informa-
tion of the available data sets to understand the physical
processes that lead to the formation, evolution, and disap-
pearance of these ﬁlamentary structures. The photospheric
Fe i 6302 Å and 6173 Å lines from GFPI and CRISP will
be used to study the dynamics and temporal evolution of
photospheric structures. In addition, the former data will
be complemented by the photospheric lines acquired with
GRIS, e.g., Si i 10827 Å, Ca i 10834 Å, and Ca i 10839 Å,
in order to track the dynamics along several heights within
the photosphere. The dynamics in the chromosphere will
be covered by the He i 10830 Å triplet as well as with the
Ca ii 8542 Å line. By analyzing all available GRIS scans
we will be able to further characterize the dual-ﬂow pro-
ﬁles seen in the He i triplet and thus elucidate the origin
of the two populations shown in Fig. 5. The link between
the chromospheric ﬁlamentary structures and the underly-
ing photosphere is still an open question. Does the plasma
of the chromospheric structures, which exhibit supersonic
LOS downﬂows near the footpoints, reach the photosphere?
Are the loops also seen in the corona and if yes, what is
their behavior? SDO can provide such information (e.g.,
in the quiet corona and upper transition region with Fe ix
171 Å EUV images) to study the evolution of the loops
in the corona. The magnetic ﬁeld information of the pho-
tosphere and the chromosphere will be obtained based on
high-resolution imaging spectropolarimetric data observed
with CRISP.

Regarding the method to ﬁt the dual ﬂows, we need
to expand our study to diﬀerent data sets. The goal is to
build a database, which includes many diﬀerent types of
He i 10830 Å proﬁles to automatically detect the ones with
dual-ﬂow components. This database will include proﬁles
extracted from (more mature) active regions, sunspots, arch
ﬁlament systems, and quiet-Sun regions. The χ2-statistics of
the ﬁt can provide hints, where a single component ﬁt is not
suﬃcient. However, noise and the strength of the He i ab-
sorption feature potentially obfuscate such a simplistic ap-
proach. Therefore, an automatic detection of dual-ﬂow pro-
ﬁles has to rely on easily measured line properties as, for ex-
ample, the line asymmetry. Additional improvements of the
algorithm concern the blue component of the He i triplet. In
double-peaked proﬁles, the fast blue component blends with
the slow red component, thus aﬀecting the accuracy of the
double-Lorentzian ﬁtting method.
