Abstract

A theoretical analysis of two- and three-dimensional fractional-order Hindmarsh-Rose neuronal models is pre-
sented, focusing on stability properties and occurrence of Hopf bifurcations, with respect to the fractional order
of the system chosen as bifurcation parameter. With the aim of exemplifying and validating the theoretical
results, numerical simulations are also undertaken, which reveal rich bursting behavior in the three-dimensional
fractional-order slow-fast system.

1 Introduction

Neuronal activity of biological neurons is typically modeled using the classical Hodgkin-Huxley mathe-
matical model [1], dating back to 1952, that includes nonlinear diﬀerential equations for the membrane
potential and gating variables of ionic currents. Simpliﬁed versions of the Hodgkin-Huxley model have
been introduced in 1962 by Fitzhugh and Nagumo [2] and in 1981 by Morris and Lecar [3].

In 1982, Hindmarsh and Rose [4] introduced a diﬀerent simpliﬁcation of the original Hodgkin-Huxley
model, proposing the following two-dimensional model of neuronal activity:

(cid:26) ˙x = y − ax3 + bx2 + I
˙y = c − dx2 − y

(1)

where x represents the membrane potential in the axon of a neuron and y is a recovery variable, called the
spiking variable, representing the transport rate of sodium and potassium ions through fast ion channels.
The parameters a, b, c and d are positive (a = c = 1 is often assumed) and I represents the external
stimulus.

Two years later, Hindmarsh and Rose [5] decided to improve their model by adding a third equation,
that takes into account a slow adaptation current z. The three-dimensional Hindmarsh-Rose model is
described by the following system of three diﬀerential equations:

˙x = y − ax3 + bx2 + I − z
˙y = c − dx2 − y
˙z = ε(s(x − x0) − z)

(2)




where (x0, y0) are the coordinates of the leftmost equilibrium point of the system without adaptation
(1). Here, the variable z, called the bursting variable, represents the exchange of ions through slow ionic
channels. The parameters ε and s are positive, and ε is considered to be small.

It has been previously noted that this extra mathematical complexity allows a great variety of dynamic
behaviors for the membrane potential x, including chaotic dynamics. Therefore, the Hindmarsh-Rose
neuron model has a great importance: while still being relatively simple, it allows for a good qualitative
description of many diﬀerent patterns of the action potential observed in experiments.

An important phenomenon in neuron activity is the transition between spiking, represented by a
generation of action potentials, and bursting, represented by a membrane potential changing from resting
to repetitive ﬁring state. Bifurcation phenomena correspond to qualitative changes of the information
transmitted through the axon of the neuron, determining the transition between a quiescent state and
an oscillatory one, or between diﬀerent kinds of oscillatory behaviors. Hence, bifurcation theory plays an
important role in studying the dynamics of system (2). We refer to [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] for recent results
concerning the dynamics of integer-order Hindmarsh-Rose models.

System (2) can be regarded as a slow-fast system, where the fast subsystem is given by (1), whose
bifurcation diagram provides important information about the dynamics and bursting patterns of system
(2) when ε is small enough [12]. Indeed, based on the method of dissection of neuronal bursting [13],
setting ε = 0 in (2) and studying the fast subsystem by treating z as a bifurcation parameter, typically,
the fast subsystem exhibits a limit cycle for some values of z and an equilibrium point for other values
of z. Therefore, as the slow variable z in system (2) oscillates between two values, the whole system will
burst.

In this paper, improved versions of the two- and three-dimensional Hindmarsh-Rose models are proposed
and analyzed, by replacing the integer-order derivatives by fractional-order Caputo-type derivatives
[14, 15, 16]. This fractional-order formulation is justiﬁed by research results concerning biological neurons.
Indeed, the results reported in [17] suggest that ”the oculomotor integrator, which converts eye velocity
into eye position commands, may be of fractional order. This order is less than one, and the velocity
commands have order one or greater, so the resulting net output of motor and premotor neurons can
be described as fractional diﬀerentiation relative to eye position”. Moreover, in the recent paper [18] it
has been pointed out that ”fractional diﬀerentiation provides neurons with a fundamental and general
computation ability that can contribute to eﬃcient information processing, stimulus anticipation and
frequency-independent phase shifts of oscillatory neuronal ﬁring”, emphasizing once again the utility of
developing and studying fractional-order mathematical models of neuronal activity.

The main beneﬁt of fractional-order models in comparison with classical integer-order models is that
fractional derivatives provide a good tool for the description of memory and hereditary properties of
various processes. This is obviously a desired feature when it comes to the modelling of a biological
neuron. In fact, fractional-order systems are characterized by inﬁnite memory, as opposed to integer-
order systems. The generalization of dynamical equations using fractional derivatives proved to be more
accurate in the mathematical modeling of real world phenomena arising from several interdisciplinary
areas, such as phenomenological description of viscoelastic liquids [19], diﬀusion and wave propagation
[20, 21], colored noise [22], boundary layer eﬀects in ducts [23], electromagnetic waves [24], fractional
kinetics [25], electrode-electrolyte polarization [26], etc.

In
Fractional-order models of Hindmarsh-Rose type have been recently studied in [27, 28, 29, 30].
[27, 28], the author obtains stability and bifurcation results for a two-dimensional modiﬁed fractional-order
Hindmarsh-Rose neuronal model, and introduces a state feedback method to control the Hopf bifurcation.
In [29, 30], a three-dimensional fractional-order Hindmarsh-Rose model is considered with ﬁxed numerical
values of the system parameters, and extensive numerical simulations are carried out to exemplify the
dynamical characteristics of the model, without focusing on theoretical analysis. Recently, a fractional-
order Morris-Lecar neuron model with fast-slow variables has been investigated in [31], revealing some
bursting patterns that do not exist in the corresponding integer-order model.

This paper is devoted to the theoretical analysis of the two- and three-dimensional fractional-order
Hindmarsh-Rose neuronal models, focusing on stability properties and occurrence of Hopf bifurcations,
choosing the fractional order of the system as bifurcation parameter. The theoretical results are obtained
in a general framework, without specifying the numerical values of the system parameters, which is often
the case in previously published papers [29, 30]. Numerical simulations are also undertaken, with the aim
of exemplifying the theoretical results and revealing bursting behaviour in the three-dimensional model.

2 Preliminaries on fractional-order diﬀerential systems

In general, three diﬀerent deﬁnitions of fractional derivatives are widely used: the Gr¨unwald-Letnikov
derivative, the Riemann-Liouville derivative and the Caputo derivative. These three deﬁnitions are in
general non-equivalent. However, the main advantage of the Caputo derivative is that it only requires
initial conditions given in terms of integer-order derivatives, representing well-understood features of
physical situations and thus making it more applicable to real world problems.

loc(R+), the Caputo fractional-order derivative

Deﬁnition 1. For a continuous function f , with f ′ ∈ L1
of order q ∈ (0, 1) of f is deﬁned by
Γ(1 − q)Z t

cDqf (t) =

1

(t − s)−qf ′(s)ds.

0

Remark 1. When q → 1, the fractional order derivative cDqf (t) converges to the integer-order derivative
f ′(t).

Highly remarkable scientiﬁc books which provide the main theoretical tools for the qualitative analysis
of fractional-order dynamical systems, and at the same time, show the interconnection as well as the
contrast between classical diﬀerential equations and fractional diﬀerential equations, are [15, 14, 16].

An analogue of the classical Hartman theorem for nonlinear integer-order dynamical systems, the
linearization theorem for fractional-order dynamical systems has been recently proved in [32]. The
following stability result holds for linear autonomous fractional-order systems [33]:

Theorem 1. The linear fractional-order autonomous system

cDqx = Ax

where A ∈ Rn×n

where q ∈ (0, 1) is asymptotically stable if and only if
qπ
2

| arg(λ)| >

∀λ ∈ σ(A)

where σ(A) denotes the spectrum of the matrix A (i.e. the set of all eigenvalues).

The following result can be easily shown using basic mathematical tools.

Lemma 1. Let q ∈ (0, 1). The complex number λ satisﬁes
qπ
2

| arg(λ)| >

if and only if one of the following hold:

(3)

(i) ℜ(λ) < 0;
(ii) ℜ(λ) ≥ 0 and |ℑ(λ)| > ℜ(λ) tan qπ
2 .
Remark 2. For the integer order system ˙x = Ax, the null solution is asymptotically stable if and only
if condition (i) from Lemma 1 is satisﬁed for any λ ∈ σ(A). Lemma 1 shows that in the case of linear
fractional-order systems, the conditions for the asymptotic stability of the null solution become more
relaxed than in the integer-order case, due to the alternative provided by (ii). It is also worth noting that
if the matrix A does not have positive real eigenvalues, it is possible to choose a fractional order q such
that the null solution of cDqx = Ax is asymptotically stable. The existence of at least one positive real
root of A guarantees the instability of the null solution for any fractional order q ∈ (0, 1].

In the following, a general result for the stability of a two-dimensional fractional order dynamical system
will be explored, using Lemma 1.

Proposition 1. Let q ∈ (0, 1). The two-dimensional linear fractional-order system

λ2 − τ λ + δ = 0.

1. τ 2 − 4δ > 0. In this case, the eigenvalues are

Since ℑ(λ+) = ℑ(λ−) = 0, it can be easily seen that condition (ii) from Lemma 1 cannot be satisﬁed.
However, condition (i) from Lemma 1 is equivalent in this case to λ+ < 0, or equivalently

3 The two-dimensional fractional-order Hindmarsh-Rose model

3.1 Model description and equilibrium states

In this section, we will focus on the fast subsystem, considering the following two-dimensional fractional-
order Hindmarsh-Rose model:

(cid:26) cDqx = y − F (x) + I
cDqy = G(x) − y

(4)

where x denotes the cell membrane potential and y represents a recovery variable, while I denotes the
external stimulus. The fractional order of the system (4) is q ∈ (0, 1). The following assumptions are
considered for the functions F and G (see [5]):

4

i. F is cubic and F (x) → ∞ as x → ∞;
ii. G is quadratic;

iii. both F and G have a local maximum value at x = 0 and F (0) = 0.

With these conditions, the general forms of F and G are

F (x) = ax3 − bx2
G(x) = c − dx2

where a, b, c, d are positive constants. Usually, it is assumed that a = c = 1.

The equilibrium states of system (4) satisfy the following equations:

(cid:26) y − F (x) + I = 0
G(x) − y = 0

(5)

Eliminating y from this system (y = G(x)), we obtain F (x)− G(y) = I which can be written in the form:
(6)

x3 − px2 = r

where p =

b − d
a

and r =

I + c

a

.

Denoting h(x) = x3 − px2, the roots of its derivative h′(x) = x(3x − 2p) are 0 and
roots as follows:

2p
3

. We denote these

α1 = min(cid:26)0,

2p

3 (cid:27)

and

α2 = max(cid:26)0,

2p

3 (cid:27) .

Hence, the function h has a local maximum at α1 and a local minimum at α2, where h(α1) > h(α2). We
consider the following bijective functions:

• h1 : (−∞, α1) → (−∞, h(α1)), the restriction of h to (−∞, α1), i.e. h1 = h|(−∞,α1);
• h2 : [α1, α2] → [h(α2), h(α1)], the restriction of h to [α1, α2], i.e. h2 = h|[α1,α2];
• h3 : (α2,∞) → (h(α2),∞), the restriction of h to (α2,∞), i.e. h3 = h|(α2,∞);

The functions h1 and h3 are strictly increasing, while the function h2 is decreasing.

Hence, we have three branches of equilibrium states for system (4), with respect to the parameter r:

• For r ∈ (−∞, h(α1)), we have the branch of equilibrium states E1(r) = (x⋆

1(r), G(x⋆

1(r))), with

1(r) = h−1
x⋆

1 (r) < α1.

• For r ∈ [h(α2), h(α1)], we have the branch of equilibrium states E2(r) = (x⋆

2(r), G(x⋆

2(r))), with

2(r) = h−1
x⋆

2 (r) ∈ [α1, α2].

• For r ∈ (h(α2),∞), we have the branch of equilibrium states E3(r) = (x⋆

3(r), G(x⋆

3(r))), with

3(r) = h−1
x⋆

3 (r) > α2.

Remark 4. The three branches of equilibrium states coexist if and only if r ∈ (h(α2), h(α1)), meaning
that for every value of r in the interval (h(α2), h(α1)), there are exactly three equilibrium states of system
(4). On the other hand, for every r outside the interval [h(α2), h(α1)] there is a unique equilibrium state
of system (4).

3.2 Stability of equilibrium states

In this section, we will analyze the stability of the equilibrium states of system (4), based on the results
presented in Proposition 1 and Remark 3.

The jacobian matrix of (4) at an equilibrium state E⋆ = (x⋆, G(x⋆)) is

A(x⋆) =(cid:18) −F ′(x⋆)

G′(x⋆) −1 (cid:19)

1

and its trace and determinant are given by

τ (x⋆) = −F ′(x⋆) − 1 = −3a(x⋆)2 + 2bx⋆ − 1
δ(x⋆) = F ′(x⋆) − G′(x⋆) = ah′(x⋆) = ax⋆(3x⋆ − 2p)

Remark 5. We will now shortly analyze the sign of the trace τ (x) and the determinant δ(x).

If b2 < 3a then τ (x) does not have real roots and therefore τ (x) = −3ax2 + 2bx − 1 < 0 for any x ∈ R.
On the other hand, if b2 ≥ 3a then τ (x) = −3ax2 + 2bx − 1 has positive real roots

b − √b2 − 3a

3a

γ1 =

and

γ2 =

b + √b2 − 3a

.

3a

In this case, τ (x) will be positive for x ∈ (γ1, γ2) and negative otherwise.
Since α1 and α2 are the roots of h′, it can be easily seen that the determinant δ(x) is positive, whenever
x < α1 or x > α2, and negative if x ∈ (α1, α2). From Proposition 1, it easily follows that if δ(x⋆) ≤ 0,
the equilibrium state (x⋆, G(x⋆)) cannot be asymptotically stable.

Proposition 2. Regarding the stability of the equilibrium states, the following results holds:

(a) The equilibrium states belonging to the ﬁrst branch E1(r), where r ∈ (−∞, h(α1)), are asymptotically

stable.

(b) The equilibrium states belonging to the second branch E2(r), where r ∈ (h(α2), h(α1)), are unstable.
(c.1) If b2 ≤ 3a, the equilibrium states belonging to the third branch E3(r), where r > h(α2), are

asymptotically stable.

(c.2) If b2 > 3a, the equilibrium states belonging to the third branch E3(r), where r > h(α2), are

asymptotically stable if and only if one of the following cases hold:

Proof. (a) Let us ﬁrst consider r ∈ (−∞, h(α1)) and the corresponding equilibrium state E1(r) from the

(b) Let r ∈ (h(α2), h(α1)) and the corresponding equilibrium state E2(r) from the second branch. We

Remark 6. It is important to notice that if we exclude the last two cases from (c.2) in Proposition
1, we obtain necessary and suﬃcient conditions for the asymptotic stability of the equilibrium states,
regardless of the fractional order q. Moreover, these conditions correspond to the asymptotic stability
of the equilibrium states in the framework of the classical integer order system. Conditions (c.2.4) and
(c.2.5) speciﬁcally correspond to the fractional order case, and they show that it is possible to stabilize the
equilibrium states from the branch E3(r) by a suitable choice of the fractional order q.

3.3 Remarks on Hopf bifurcation phenomena

Concerning the bifurcation phenomena occurring in fractional-order dynamical systems, very few results
are known at this moment. The recent paper [34] attempts to formulate conditions for the Hopf bifurca-
tion, based on observations arising from numerical simulations. However, the complete characterization
of the Hopf bifurcation and the stability of the resulting limit cycle is still an open question.

As it can be seen from Proposition 2, the two main parameters that characterize the stability and

bifurcation parameters in system (4) are r =
the fractional order q of the system.

I + c

, which is determined by the external stimulus, and

Based on [34] and the asymptotic stability results presented in Proposition 2, it may be concluded that
Hopf bifurcations can take place in (4), only on the third branch of equilibria, when b2 > 3a and the
fractional order q reaches the critical value

3.4 Numerical example

For all numerical simulations, the generalization of the Adams-Bashforth-Moulton predictor-corrector
method has been used [35]. The drawback of all numerical methods available for fractional-order
dynamical systems is that, in order to obtain a reliable estimation of the solution, because of the hereditary
nature of the problem, at every iteration step all previous iterations have to be taken into account, and
hence, the computational costs are very high if the solution is computed over a large time interval.

We will consider the following values for the parameters appearing in system (4):

a = 1;

b = 3;

c = 1;

d = 5.

These are the reference values given by Hindmarsh and Rose [5], and used frequently in the literature for
numerical simulations.

In this case, we obviously have b2 > 3a. We compute p =

System (4) has three equilibria if and only if r ∈ [h(0), h(2p/3)] = [0, 1.18519]. Outside this interval, (4)
has a unique equilibrium state.

Based on the previous remarks, a Hopf bifurcation may occur in system (4), in a neighborhood of the
equilibrium state E3(r), if and only if

when the fractional order q exceeds the critical value q⋆(r) given by (7). The critical values q⋆(r) belong
to the Hopf bifurcation curve represented in Fig. 1.

Figure 1: The Hopf bifurcation curve (red) in the (r, q)-plane, for r ∈ [h(γ1), h(γ2)] = [0.07353, 12.5931]
(where r = I + 1). For a ﬁxed r in this range and for q < q⋆(r) (below the curve), the equilibrium state
E3(r) is asymptotically stable.

For example, when r = 1 (i.e. I = 0, which corresponds to the resting state), this critical value is
q⋆(1) = 0.730585. When the fractional order q of the system is lower than this critical value, the
equilibrium state E3(1) is asymptotically stable. However, when the fractional order q crosses this
critical value, a Hopf bifurcation occurs in system (4),
in a neighborhood of the equilibrium state
E3(1). Numerical simulations show that this Hopf bifurcation is supercritical, i.e., it results in the
appearance of a stable limit cycle.
2, the stable limit cycles corresponding to values of
q ∈ {0.75, 0.8, 0.85, 0.9, 0.95, 1} are shown, together with the three equilibrium states of the system (E1(1)
is asymptotically stable, E2(1) is a saddle point, and E3(1) becomes unstable for q > q⋆(1) = 0.730585.)

this value of the parameter r, E3(4.25) is the unique equilibrium state of system (4).

ral network model

4.1 Model description and theoretical considerations

Following [5], we extend the two-dimensional model (4) by adding a third equation, taking into account
the slow adaptation current z, which will be our bursting variable. The three-dimensional slow-fast
fractional-order model that we consider is:

cDqx = y − ax3 + bx2 + I − z
cDqy = c − dx2 − y
cDqz = ε(s(x − x0) − z)

(8)




where ε ∈ (0, 1) is small, s > 0 and x0 is the ﬁrst coordinate of the leftmost equilibrium point of the
system without adaptation (4) at the resting state (I0 = 0, or equivalently, r = r0 =

), i.e.

c
a

x0 = h−1

1 (r0) < α1

where we have taken into account the notations from subsection 3.1. Due to this choice of x0, it can be
easily seen that (x0, G(x0), 0) is an equilibrium point of the system with adaptation (8) corresponding to
the null external stimulus I0 = 0, as in [5].

The equilibrium states of system (8) are given by the following algebraic system:

where the notations p =

are the same as in the previous section. Considering the

it follows that system (8) has at most three equilibrium states, depending on the number of real roots of
the equation

H(x) = r.

In the rest of this paper, we will consider that the following assumption holds (in accordance with the
numerical data):

(A)

(b − d)2 < 3as

Proposition 3. The function H(x) is strictly increasing and there exists a unique branch of equilibrium
states ˜E(r) = (x⋆(r), G(x⋆(r)), s(x⋆(r) − x0)), with r ∈ R, for system (8), where x⋆(r) = H −1(r).

Proof. It can be easily seen that

H ′(x) = 3x2 − 2px +

s
a

and hence, due to assumption (A), we obtain that the discriminant is

∆ = 4(cid:16)p2 − 3

We deduce that H ′ is strictly positive, and the cubic polynomial H is strictly increasing (and invertible)
on R, so it has a unique real root x⋆(r) = H −1(r).

4.2 Stability analysis

The jacobian matrix of (8) at the equilibrium state ˜E(r) is

˜A(x⋆(r)) =


where x⋆ = x⋆(r) is given by Proposition 3.

The characteristic polynomial is given by:

−F ′(x⋆)
G′(x⋆) −1

εs

1 −1
0

0 −ε 


P (λ) = λ3 + (F ′(x⋆) + 1 + ε)λ2 + [(1 + ε)F ′(x⋆) − G′(x⋆) + (1 + s)ε]λ + ε[F ′(x⋆) − G′(x⋆) + s]

Taking into account the notations from subsection 3.2, namely:

τ (x) = −F ′(x) − 1 = −3ax2 + 2bx − 1
δ(x) = F ′(x) − G′(x) = ah′(x) = ax(3x − 2p)

the characteristic polynomial can be rewritten as

P (λ) = λ3 + [ε − τ (x⋆)]λ2 + [δ(x⋆) − ετ (x⋆) + εs]λ + ε[δ(x⋆) + s]

Applying the Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion, necessary and suﬃcient conditions for the asymptotic
stability of the equilibrium state ˜E(r) can be obtained for the integer-order case q = 1, and subsequently,
for any fractional order q ∈ (0, 1). However, taking into consideration the large number of parameters
involved in the expression of the characteristic polynomial P (λ), it is diﬃcult to obtain general conditions
for asymptotic stability in terms of the parameter r, and therefore, the Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion
will not be utilized in this paper.

Remark 7. It is easy to verify that assumption (A) implies δ(x) + s > 0, for any x ∈ R. Therefore, as
the product of the roots of the characteristic polynomial P (λ) is λ1λ2λ3 = −ε(δ(x⋆) + s) < 0, we deduce
that at least one root of the characteristic polynomial is negative. In fact, it is easy to evaluate

P (−ε) = ε(1 − ε)s > 0,
and hence, P (λ) has at least one root in the interval (−∞,−ε).

Proposition 4. For any r ≤ H(α1) or r ≥ H(cid:18) 2b

3a(cid:19), the equilibrium state ˜E(r) of system (8) is

asymptotically stable (regardless of the fractional order q, or the value of the parameter ε).

3a(cid:19),
Proof. If r ≤ H(α1), we have x⋆ = x⋆(r) = H −1(r) ≤ α1 ≤ 0. On the other hand, if r ≥ H(cid:18) 2b
2b
we have x⋆ = x⋆(r) = H −1(r) ≥
3a ≥ α2. It can easily be deduced that in both cases, δ(x⋆) ≥ 0 and
τ (x⋆) ≤ −1.
Hence, we have:

P (τ (x⋆) − ε) = −ετ (x⋆)2 + [ε2 + εs + δ(x⋆)]τ (x⋆) + ε(1 − ε)s

≤ −ετ (x⋆)2 − [ε2 + εs + δ(x⋆)] + ε(1 − ε)s
= −ετ (x⋆)2 − ε2(1 + s) − δ(x⋆) < 0

Therefore, the characteristic polynomial P (λ) will have a negative real root λ1 ∈ (τ (x⋆) − ε,−ε). The
other two roots verify

λ2 + λ3 = τ (x⋆) − ε − λ1 < 0

and hence, they are in the left half-plane. We conclude that the equilibrium state ˜E(r) is asymptotically
stable.

From Proposition 4, we deduce that ˜E(r) is asymptotically stable for any r ≤ H(α1) or r ≥ H(cid:18) 2b
equivalently, for any I ≤ 1.32399 or I ≥ 29.4721, regardless of the fractional order q, or the value of the
parameter ε. On the other hand, when I ∈ (1.32399, 29.4721), the equilibrium ˜E(r) looses its stability
for certain combinations of the external stimulus I and the fractional order q. Fig. 4 shows the stability
region in the (I, q)-plane for the equilibrium ˜E(r), as well as the critical values q⋆(r) given by equation
(12). Precise details about the dynamic behavior in a neighborhood of the equilibrium ˜E(r) of (8) are
given in Table 1.

Figure 4: The stability region in the (I, q)-plane for the 3-dimensional system, for I ∈ [0, 30]. For a
combination of parameters (I, q) in the gray region, the equilibrium state ˜E(r) is asymptotically stable
(with r = I + 1). The critical values q⋆(r) given by (12) are shown in red.

The most interesting dynamic behavior in system (8) is observed when I ∈ (2.31369, 5.07454), i.e., when
the equilibrium ˜E(r) is unstable for any q ∈ (0, 1). In fact, this is the range for the external stimulus
where bursting behavior has been observed by numerical simulations. For I = 3.25, the trajectories of
system (8), with initial conditions given by ˜E(1) (resting state corresponding to I = 0) are shown in Fig.

that as the fractional order q decreases, the number of spikes in individual bursts increases.

5 Conclusions

The fractional-order Hindmarsh-Rose models presented in this paper are realistic generalizations of the
corresponding integer-order models, taking advantage of the fact that fractional-order derivatives are
more precise in the description of dielectric processes and memory properties of membranes. Choosing
the fractional order of the systems as bifurcation parameter, a theoretical stability and Hopf bifurcation
analysis has been accomplished for the two- and three-dimensional fractional-order Hindmarsh-Rose
models, allowing us to gain a better insight into neuronal activities. The theoretical results have been
obtained without specifying ﬁxed numerical values for the system parameters. Moreover, numerical
simulations reveal rich bursting behavior in the three dimensional slow-fast model, which is consistent
with experimental data. It is worth emphasizing that bursting behavior is observed for a total fractional-
order of the system 3q ∈ (2, 3).
