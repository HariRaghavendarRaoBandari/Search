Abstract—Future mobile communications systems are likely to be
very different to those of today with new service innovations driven
by increasing data trafﬁc demand, increasing processing power
of smart devices and new innovative applications. To meet these
service demands the telecommunications industry is converging on
a common set of 5G requirements which includes network speeds as
high as 10 Gbps, cell edge rate greater than 100 Mbps, and latency
of less than 1 msec. To reach these 5G requirements the industry
is looking at new spectrum bands in the range up to 100 GHz
where there is spectrum availability for wide bandwidth channels.
For the development of new 5G systems to operate in bands up
to 100 GHz there is a need for accurate radio propagation models
which are not addressed by existing channel models developed for
bands below 6 GHz. This paper presents a preliminary overview of
the 5G channel models for bands up to 100 GHz in indoor ofﬁces
and shopping malls, derived from extensive measurements across
a multitude of bands. These studies have found some extensibility
of the existing 3GPP models (e.g. 3GPP TR36.873) to the higher
frequency bands up to 100 GHz. The measurements indicate that
the smaller wavelengths introduce an increased sensitivity of the
propagation models to the scale of the environment and show
some frequency dependence of the path loss as well as increased
occurrence of blockage. Further, the penetration loss is highly
dependent on the material and tends to increase with frequency.
The small-scale characteristics of the channel such as delay spread
and angular spread and the multipath richness is somewhat similar
over the frequency range, which is encouraging for extending the
existing 3GPP models to the wider frequency range. Further work
will be carried out to complete these models, but this paper presents
the ﬁrst steps for an initial basis for the model development.

I. INTRODUCTION

Next generation 5G cellular systems will encompass frequen-
cies from around 500 MHz all the way to around 100 GHz.
For the development of new 5G systems to operate in bands
above 6 GHz, there is a need for accurate radio propagation
models for these bands which are not fully modeled by existing
channel models below 6 GHz, as previous generations were
designed and evaluated for operation at frequencies only as high
as 6 GHz. One important example is the recently developed
3D-Indoor Hotspot (InH) channel model [1]. This paper is a
summary of key results provided in a much more detailed white
paper by the authors found at the link in [2], in addition to a
3GPP-style outdoor contribution in [3]. The 3GPP 3D channel
model provides additional ﬂexibility for the elevation dimension,
thereby allowing modeling two dimensional antenna systems,

such as those that are expected in next generation system
deployments. It is important for future system design to develop
a new channel model that will be validated for operation at higher
frequencies (e.g., up to 100 GHz) and that will allow accurate
performance evaluation of possible future technical speciﬁcations
in indoor environments. Furthermore, the new models should
be consistent with the models below 6 GHz. In some cases,
the requirements may call for deviations from the modeling
parameters or methodology of the existing models, but these
deviations should be kept to a bare minimum and only introduced
when necessary for supporting the 5G simulation use cases.

There are many existing and ongoing campaign efforts world-
wide targeting 5G channel measurements and modeling. They in-
clude METIS2020 [4], COST2100/COST [5], IC1004 [6], ETSI
mmWave [7], NIST 5G mmWave Channel Model Alliance [8],
MiWEBA [9], mmMagic [10], and NYU WIRELESS [11]–[14].
METIS2020, for instance, has focused on 5G technologies and
has contributed extensive studies in terms of channel modelling.
Their target requirements include a wide range of frequency
bands (up to 86 GHz), very large bandwidths (hundreds of
MHz), fully three dimensional and accurate polarization mod-
elling, spherical wave modelling, and high spatial resolution. The
METIS channel models consist of a map-based model, stochastic
model, and a hybrid model which can meet requirement of
ﬂexibility and scalability.

The COST2100 channel model is a geometry-based stochas-
tic channel model (GSCM) that can reproduce the stochastic
properties of multiple-input/multiple output (MIMO) channels
over time, frequency, and space. On the other hand, the 5G
mmWave Channel Model Alliance is newly established and will
establish guidelines for measurement calibration and method-
ology, modeling methodology, as well as parameterization in
various environments and a database for channel measurement
campaigns. NYU WIRELESS has conducted and published
extensive urban propagation measurements at 28, 38, 60, and
73 GHz for both outdoor and indoor channels, and has created
large-scale and small-scale channel models and concepts of time
cluster spatial lobes (TCSL) to model multiple multipath time
clusters that are seen to arrive in particular directions [11]–[13],
[15]–[18].

This paper presents a brief overview of the indoor channel
properties for bands up to 100 GHz based on extensive mea-
surements and results across a multitude of bands. In addition

we present a preliminary set of channel parameters suitable for
indoor 5G simulations that are capable of capturing the main
properties and trends.

II. REQUIREMENTS FOR NEW CHANNEL MODEL

The requirements of the new channel model that will support
5G operation across frequency bands up to 100 GHz are outlined
below:

1) The new channel model should preferably be based on the
existing 3GPP 3D channel model [1] but with extensions
to cater for additional 5G modeling requirements and
scenarios, for example:
arrays,

a) Antenna

especially at higher-frequency
millimeter-wave bands, will very likely be 2D and
dual-polarized both at the access point (AP) and at the
user equipment (UE) and will hence need properly-
modeled azimuth and elevation angles of departure
and arrival of multipath components.

b) Individual antenna elements will have antenna radi-
ation patterns in azimuth and elevation and may re-
quire separate modeling for directional performance
gains. Furthermore, polarization properties of the
multipath components need to be accurately ac-
counted for in the model.

2) The new channel model must accommodate a wide fre-
quency range up to 100 GHz. The joint propagation
characteristics over different frequency bands will need to
be evaluated for multi-band operation, e.g., low-band and
high-band carrier aggregation conﬁgurations.

3) The new channel model must support large channel band-

widths (up to 2 GHz), where:

a) The individual channel bandwidths may be in the
range of 100 MHz to 2 GHz and may support carrier
aggregation.

b) The operating channels may be spread across an

assigned range of several GHz.

4) The new channel model must support a range of large

antenna arrays, in particular:

a) Some large antenna arrays will have very high direc-
tivity with angular resolution of the channel down to
around 1.0 degree.

b) 5G will consist of different array types, e.g., linear,
planar, cylindrical and spherical arrays, with arbitrary
polarization.

c) The array manifold vector can change signiﬁcantly
when the bandwidth is large relative to the carrier
frequency. As such,
the wideband array manifold
assumption is not valid and new modeling techniques
may be required. It may be preferable, for example, to
model departure/arrival angles with delays across the
array and follow a spherical wave assumption instead
of the usual plane wave assumption.

5) The new channel model must accommodate mobility, in
particular (for outdoor models, although mentioned here
for consistency):

a) The channel model structure should be suitable for

mobility up to 350 km/hr.

b) The channel model structure should be suitable for
small-scale mobility and rotation of both ends of the
link in order to support scenarios such as device to
device (D2D) or vehicle to vehicle (V2V).

6) The

new channel model must

ensure
tial/temporal/frequency consistency, in particular:

spa-

a) The model should provide spatial/temporal/frequency
consistencies which may be characterized, for exam-
ple, via spatial consistence, inter-site correlation, and
correlation among frequency bands.

b) The model should also ensure that the channel states,
such as line-of-sight (LOS)/non-LOS (NLOS) for
outdoor/indoor locations, the second order statistics
of the channel, and the channel realizations change
smoothly as a function of time, antenna position,
and/or frequency in all propagation scenarios.

c) The spatial/temporal/frequency consistencies should
be supported for simulations where the channel con-
sistency impacts the results (e.g. massive MIMO,
mobility and beam tracking, etc.). Such support could
possibly be optional for simpler studies.

7) The new channel model must be of practical computational

complexity, in particular:

a) The model should be suitable for implementation in
single-link simulation tools and in multi-cell, multi-
link radio network simulation tools. Computational
complexity and memory requirements should not be
excessive. The 3GPP 3D channel model [1] is seen,
for instance, as a sufﬁciently accurate model for its
purposes, with an acceptable level of complexity.
Accuracy may be provided by including additional
modeling details with reasonable complexity to sup-
port the greater channel bandwidths, and spatial and
temporal resolutions and spatial/temporal/frequency
consistency, required for millimeter-wave modeling.
b) The introduction of a new modeling methodology
(e.g. Map based model) may signiﬁcantly complicate
the channel generation mechanism and thus substan-
tially increase the implementation complexity of the
system-level simulator. Furthermore, if one applies
a completely different modeling methodology for
frequencies above 6 GHz, it would be difﬁcult to have
meaningful comparative system evaluations for bands
up to 100 GHz.

III. INDOOR DEPLOYMENT SCENARIOS - INDOOR (INH):

OPEN AND CLOSED OFFICE, SHOPPING MALL

The indoor scenario includes open and closed ofﬁces, corridors
within ofﬁces and shopping malls as examples. The typical
ofﬁce environment has open cubicle areas, walled ofﬁces, open
areas, corridors, etc., where the partition walls are composed
of a variety of materials like sheetrock, poured concrete, glass,
cinder block, etc. For the ofﬁce environment, APs are generally
mounted at a height of 2-3 m either on the ceilings or walls,
with UEs at heights between 1.2 and 1.5 m. Shopping malls
are generally 2-5 stories high and often include an open area
(“atrium”). In the shopping-mall environment, APs are generally
mounted at a height of approximately 3 m on the walls or ceilings
of the corridors and shops, with UEs at heights between 1.2 and

1.5 m. The density of APs may range from one per ﬂoor to one
per room, depending on the frequency band and output power.
A typical indoor ofﬁce and shopping mall scenario are shown in
Figures 1 and 2, respectively.

IV. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE INH CHANNEL FROM 6 GHZ

TO 100 GHZ

Measurements over a wide range of frequencies have been
performed by the co-authors of this paper. In the following
sections we outline the main observations per scenario with
some comparisons to the existing 3GPP models for below 6 GHz
(e.g. [1]).

In LOS conditions, multiple reﬂections from walls, ﬂoor, and
ceiling give rise to waveguiding. Measurements in both ofﬁce and
shopping mall scenarios show that path loss exponents, based on
a 1 m free space reference distance, are typically below 2 in LOS
conditions, leading to more favorable path loss than predicted
by Friis’ free space path loss formula. The strength of the
waveguiding effect is variable and the path loss exponent appears
to increase very slightly with increasing frequency, possibly due
to the relation between the wavelength and surface roughness.

Fig. 1: Typical Indoor Ofﬁce.

Fig. 2: Indoor Shopping Malls.

Fig. 3: 2.5 GHz, 28 GHz, and 60 GHz normalized material penetration
losses from indoor measurements with common types of glass and walls
were lumped together into common datasets [13], [20], [21].

Measurements of the small scale channel properties such
as angular spread and delay spread have shown remarkable
similarities between channels over a very wide frequency range.
It appears as if the main multipath components are present at all
frequencies though with some smaller variations in amplitudes.
Recent work shows that polarization discrimination ranges
between 15 and 25 dB for indoor millimeter wave channels [19],
with greater polarization discrimination at 73 GHz than at 28
GHz [14].

V. PENETRATION INSIDE BUILDINGS

Measurements have been reported for penetration loss for var-
ious materials at 2.5, 28, and 60 GHz for indoor scenarios [11],
[12], [20], [21], although all materials were not measured for
the same frequencies. For easy comparisons, walls and drywalls
were lumped together into a common dataset and different types
of clear class were lumped together into a common dataset with
normalized penetration loss shown in Figure 3. It was observed
that clear glass has widely varying attenuation (20 dB/cm at 2.5
GHz, 3.5 dB/cm at 28 GHz, and 11.3 dB/cm at 60 GHz). For
mesh glass, penetration was observed to increase as a function of
frequency (24.1 dB/cm at 2.5 GHz and 31.9 dB/cm at 60 GHz),
and a similar trend was observed with whiteboard penetration
increasing as frequency increased. At 28 GHz, indoor tinted
glass resulted in a penetration loss of 24.5 dB/cm. Walls showed
very little attenuation per cm of distance at 28 GHz (less than 1
dB/cm) [2]. Furthermore, a simple parabolic model as a function
of frequency for low-loss and high-loss building penetration is
given in [3].

VI. PATH LOSS, SHADOW FADING, LOS, AND BLOCKAGE

MODELING

A. LOS Probability

The deﬁnition of LOS used in this paper is discussed in this
sub-section together with other LOS models. The LOS state is
determined by a map-based approach, i.e., by considering the
transmitter (AP) and receiver (UE) positions and whether any
buildings or walls block the direct path between the AP and the
UE. The impact of objects not represented in the map such as
chairs, desks, ofﬁce furniture, etc. is modelled separately using

Table II shows the parameters of the CI, CIF, and ABG
path loss models for different environments for omnidirectional
antennas. It may be noted that the models presented here are
multi-frequency models, and the parameters are invariant to
carrier frequency and can be applied across the 0.5-100 GHz
band.

PLCI (f, d)[dB] = FSPL(f, 1 m) + 10n log10(cid:18) d

σ
(2)
where f is the frequency in Hz, n is the PLE, d is the distance
in meters, X CI
is the shadow fading (SF) with σ in dB, and the
free space path loss (FSPL) at 1 m, with frequency f is given
as:

1 m(cid:19) + X CI

σ

FSPL(f, 1 m) = 20 log10(cid:18) 4πf
c (cid:19) ,

where c is the speed of light.

The ABG PL model [14], [25], [28], [29] is given as:

PLABG(f, d)[dB] = 10α log10(d) + β
+10γ log10(f ) + X ABG

σ

where α captures how the PL increase as the transmit-receive
distance (in meters) increases, β is a ﬂoating offset value in dB,
γ attempts to capture the PL variation over the frequency f in
GHz, and X ABG
is the SF term with standard deviation in dB.
The CIF PL model is an extension of the CI model [14], and

σ

uses a frequency-dependent path loss exponent given by:

PLCIF(f, d)[dB] = FSPL(f, 1 m)+

10n 1 + b(cid:18) f − f0

f0 (cid:19)! log10(cid:18) d

1 m(cid:19) + X CIF

σ

(5)

where n denotes the path loss exponent (PLE), and b is an
optimization parameter that captures the slope, or linear fre-
quency dependency of the path loss exponent that balances
at the centroid of the frequencies being modeled (e.g., path
loss increases as f increases when b is positive). The term f0
is a ﬁxed reference frequency, the centroid of all frequencies
represented by the path loss model [14], found as the weighed
sum of measurements from different frequencies, using the
following equation:

(3)

(4)

(6)

k=1 fkNK
k=1 NK

f0 = PK
PK

where K is the number of unique frequencies, and Nk is
the number of path loss data points corresponding to the kth
frequency fk. The input parameter f0 represents the weighted
frequencies of all measurement (or Ray-tracing) data applied
to the model. The CIF model reverts to the CI model when
b = 0 for multiple frequencies, or when a single frequency f
= f0 is modelled. For InH, a dual-slope path loss model might
provide a good ﬁt for different distance zones of the propagation
environment. Frequency dependency is also observed in some
of the indoor measurement campaigns conducted by co-authors.
For NLOS, both a dual-slope ABG and dual-slope CIF model
can be considered for 5G performance evaluation (they each
require 5 modeling parameters to be optimized), and a single-
slope CIF model (that uses only 2 optimization parameters) may
be considered as a special case for InH-Ofﬁce [14]. The dual-
slope may be best suited for InH-shopping mall or large indoor

shadowing/blocking terms. An attractive feature of this LOS
deﬁnition is that it is frequency independent, as only walls are
considered in the deﬁnition.

Since the 3GPP 3D model [1] does not include an indoor
scenario for LOS-probability, and the indoor hotspot scenario in
e.g. the IMT advanced model [22] differs from the ofﬁce scenario
considered in this paper, an investigation on the LOS probability
for indoor ofﬁce has been conducted based on ray-tracing
simulations. Different styles of indoor ofﬁce environments were
investigated, including open-plan ofﬁce with cubical area, closed-
plan ofﬁce with corridor and meeting room, and also a hybrid-
plan ofﬁce with both open and closed areas. It has been veriﬁed
that the following model ﬁts the propagation in indoor ofﬁce
environment the best, of the three models evaluated:

exp(−(d − 6.5)/32.6) · 0.32, d ≥ 6.5 m

d ≤ 1.2 m
1.2 < d < 6.5 m

(1)
The veriﬁcation results are shown in Table I and Figure 4.
The LOS probability model used in ITU IMT-Advanced eval-
uation [22] and WINNER II [23] are also presented here for
comparison. For the ITU and WINNER II model, parameteri-
zation results based on new data vary a lot from the original
model. The results show that the new model has a good ﬁt to
the data in an average sense and can be used for 5G InH scenario
evaluations. However, note the high variability between different
deployments and degrees of openness in the ofﬁce area.

B. Path Loss Models

To adequately assess the performance of 5G systems, multi-
frequency path loss (PL) models, LOS probability, and blockage
models will need to be developed across the wide range of
frequency bands and for operating scenarios. Three PL models
are considered in this paper; namely the close-in (CI) free space
reference distance PL model [13], [20], [24] the close-in free
space reference distance model with frequency-dependent path
loss exponent (CIF) [14], and the Alpha-Beta-Gamma (ABG)
PL model [14], [25]–[27]. These models are described in the
following text and are then applied to various scenarios.

distances (greater than 50 m). The dual slope InH large scale
path loss models are given in (7) (ABG) and (8) (CIF).

In the CI PL model, only a single parameter, the path loss
exponent (PLE), needs to be determined through optimization
to minimize the SF standard deviation over the measured PL
data set [13], [24], [28]. In the CI PL model there is an anchor
point that ties path loss to the FSPL at 1 m, which captures
frequency-dependency of the path loss, and establishes a uniform
standard to which all measurements and model parameters may
be referred. In the CIF model there are 2 optimization parameters
(n and b), and since it is an extension of the CI model, it
also uses a 1 m free-space close-in reference distance path
loss anchor. In the ABG PL model there are three parameters
which need to be optimized to minimize the standard deviation
(SF) over the data set [14], [28]. Closed form expressions for
optimization of the model parameters for the CI, CIF, and ABG
path loss models are given in [14], where it was shown that
indoor channels experience an increase in the PLE value as
the frequency increases, whereas the PLE is not very frequency
dependent in outdoor UMa or UMi scenarios [13], [14], [24],
[28], [29]. The CI, CIF, and ABG models, as well as cross-
polarization forms and closed-form expressions for optimization
are given for indoor channels in [14].

Another important issue related to path loss is shadow fading.
For InH, the distance dependency and frequency dependency
were investigated for both indoor ofﬁce and shopping mall.
For the LOS propagation condition, the frequency and distance
dependency is weak. But for the NLOS propagation condition,
frequency and distance dependency is more apparent as indicated
in Table 7 of [2].

VII. FAST FADING MODELING

For InH scenarios, an investigation of fast fading modelling
has been conducted based on both measurement and ray-tracing.
Both indoor ofﬁce and shopping mall environments have been
investigated at frequencies including 2.9 GHz, 3.5 GHz, 6
GHz, 14 GHz, 15 GHz, 20 GHz, 28 GHz, 29 GHz, 60 GHz,
and 73 GHz. Some preliminary analysis on large-scale channel
characteristics have been summarized in [2]. Although it is still
too early to apply these results to the full frequency range up to
100 GHz, these preliminary investigations have provided insight
into the difference induced by the largely extended frequency
range. The preliminary analysis in [2] illustrates the frequency
dependency of large-scale channel characteristics across the
measured frequency range.

VIII. CONCLUSION

The basis for this paper is the open literature in combination
with recent and ongoing propagation channel measurements
performed by a majority of the co-authors of this paper, some of
which are as of yet unpublished. The InH propagation models are
somewhat different from the outdoor UMi and UMa models in
that the indoor channels are more frequency-dependent than out-
door channels, leading to the ABG and CIF frequency-dependent
NLOS path loss models. In LOS conditions, waveguiding effects
were observed in all frequencies measured, leading to path loss
exponents less than the theoretical value of n = 2 in LOS. The
preceding tables give an overview of these recent measurement
activities in different frequency bands and scenarios, in addition
to further information provided in [2].
