THE NUMBER OF LINEAR TRANSFORMATIONS DEFINED

ON A SUBSPACE WITH GIVEN INVARIANT FACTORS

SAMRITH RAM

Abstract. Given a ﬁnite-dimensional vector space V over the ﬁnite ﬁeld Fq
and a subspace W of V , we consider the problem of counting linear transforma-
tions T : W → V which have prescribed invariant factors. The case W = V is
a well-studied problem that is essentially equivalent to counting the number of
square matrices over Fq in a conjugacy class and an explicit formula is known
in this case. We extend this result to the case of arbitrary W by giving an
explicit counting formula. As an application of our results, we give new proofs
of some recent enumerative results in linear control theory and derive an ex-
tension of the Gerstenhaber-Reiner formula for the number of square matrices
over Fq with given characteristic polynomial.

1. Introduction

Let Fq denote the ﬁnite ﬁeld with q elements and let Fq[x] denote the ring
of polynomials in the indeterminate x with coeﬃcients in Fq. Throughout this
paper, n, k denote positive integers with n ≥ k. For any ring R, we denote by
Mn,k(R) the set of all n × k matrices with entries in R and by Mn(R) the set
of all square n × n matrices with entries in R. Let GLn(Fq) denote the general
linear group of nonsingular matrices of Mn(Fq).

Given any nonzero polynomial matrix A ∈ Mn,k(Fq[x]), there exist invertible
matrices P ∈ Mn(Fq[x]) and Q ∈ Mk(Fq[x]) such that the product P AQ is of the
form

where all oﬀ-diagonal entries are zero and the nonzero entries on the diagonal are
monic polynomials pi(1 ≤ i ≤ t) satisfying pi | pi+1 for 1 ≤ i < t. This diagonal
form is known as the Smith normal form of A. We express this concisely by
writing A ∼ diagn,k(p1, . . . , pt). The pi are known as the invariant factors of A
and are given by

pi =

δi(A)
δi−1(A)

,

where δi(A) denotes the ith determinantal divisor of A and equals the greatest
common divisor of all i × i minors of the matrix A.

Let us denote by In,k the element of Mn,k(Fq) whose (i, j)-th entry is 1 for
i = j and zero otherwise. In this paper, we are mainly interested in counting the
number of matrices B ∈ Mn,k(Fq) for which the matrix polynomial xIn,k − B has
a prescribed list of invariant factors. More precisely, for any k-tuple of invariant
factors, i.e., a tuple I = (p1, . . . , pk) of monic polynomials in Fq[x] such that
pi | pi+1(1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1), deﬁne

Nq(n, k; I) := #(cid:8)B ∈ Mn,k(Fq) : xIn,k − B ∼ diagn,k(p1, . . . , pk)(cid:9) .

We are interested in a formula for Nq(n, k; I). In fact, the problem of determining
Nq(n, n; I) is equivalent to counting the number of square n × n matrices over Fq
in a conjugacy class. This problem has been studied by Kung [10] and Stong [16]
among others, and an explicit formula (see (1)) can be found in Stanley [15].

On the other hand, rectangular matrices arise in many contexts in linear control
theory and matrix completion problems and are also of considerable interest. We
refer to Cravo [1, Thms. 15, 32] for speciﬁc examples of matrix completion
problems. For another example, suppose k < n and I1 denotes the k-tuple
(1, . . . , 1). Determining Nq(n, k; I1) is equivalent to the problem of counting the
number of zero kernel pairs over a ﬁnite ﬁeld. We refer to Gohberg et al.
[6,
Sec. X.1] or [11] for the deﬁnition of zero kernel pairs. The problem of counting
zero kernel pairs goes back at least to the work of Kocie˛cki and Przy luski [9] who
considered the equivalent problem of determining the number of reachable pairs
(see Deﬁnition 4.1) of matrices over a ﬁnite ﬁeld. This problem has recently been
[8, Thm. 1] who also solve the more general problem
settled by Helmke et al.
of determining the number of matrix pairs with an r-dimensional reachability
subspace (see Deﬁnition 4.2).

The main result of this paper is Theorem 3.6 which is a counting formula for
the number of linear transformations deﬁned on a subspace which have a given
invariant subspace and prescribed invariant factors. We use this result to deduce
Theorem 3.8 which gives a formula for Nq(n, k; I) for an arbitrary k-tuple I
of invariant factors. We give further applications of our results in Sections 4
and 5. In Section 4 we give an alternate proof of the formula of Helmke et al.
(Theorem 4.6) for the number of matrix pairs with an r-dimensional reachability
subspace. Studying linear maps deﬁned on a subspace allows us to extend some
combinatorial results on square matrices to the setting of rectangular matrices.

As an illustration, we prove an extension of the Gerstenhaber-Reiner formula for
the number of square matrices with given characteristic polynomial in Section 5.

2. Preliminaries and Notation

It is a well-known fact that two matrices A, A′ ∈ Mn(Fq) are similar, i.e., there
exists P ∈ GLn(Fq) with A′ = P AP −1, if and only if they have the same invariant
factors. More precisely, if

xIn − A ∼ diagn,n(p1, . . . , pn) and xIn − A′ ∼ diagn,n(p′

1, . . . , p′

n),

then A is similar to A′ if and only if pi = p′
i for 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Therefore, the
conjugacy class of all matrices similar to A is uniquely determined by the invariant
factors of A. To give an expression for the number of matrices in the conjugacy
class determined by an n-tuple of invariant factors, we introduce some notation.
Following Stanley [15, Sec. 1.10], we denote by Par the set of all partitions
of all nonnegative integers. We write λ ⊢ n if λ is a partition of n. Given any
partition λ ∈ Par, let λ′ = (λ′
2, . . .) denote the conjugate partition to λ and
let mi = mi(λ) = λ′

1, λ′

i − λ′

i+1 denote the number of parts of λ of size i. Let
hi = hi(λ) = λ′

2 + · · · + λ′
i.

1 + λ′

For λ ∈ Par and any irreducible f ∈ Fq[x] of degree d, deﬁne

mi

cf (λ) := Yi≥1

Yj=1(cid:0)qdhi − qd(hi−j)(cid:1) .

For f, g ∈ Fq[x] with f irreducible and g nonzero, set

νf (g) := max{e : f e | g}.

Given a tuple I = (p1, . . . , pk) of invariant factors, let S(I) denote the set of all
i=1 pi. To each f ∈ S(I), we

associate a partition ΦI(f ) ⊢ νf (P ) by deﬁning

ΦI(f ) := (νf (pk), νf (pk−1), . . . , νf (pr)) ,

where r = min{i : νf (pi) > 0}. The following formula (essentially equivalent to
[15, Eq. 1.107]) gives the size of the conjugacy class corresponding to a tuple of
invariant factors:

for any n-tuple I = (p1, . . . , pn) of invariant factors with deg(p1 · · · pn) = n. In
the next section, we recall some basic facts about linear transformations deﬁned
on a subspace and then prove an extension (Theorem 3.8) of the above formula.

3. Maps defined on a subspace with prescribed invariant factors

Throughout this paper, we denote by V an n-dimensional vector space over
Fq and by W a ﬁxed k-dimensional subspace of V . We denote by L(W, V ) the
space of all linear transformations from W to V . Let B1 = {v1, . . . , vk} be a ﬁxed
ordered basis for W and let B2 = {v1, . . . , vn} be an extension of this basis to
an ordered basis of V . We deﬁne the invariant factors of a linear transformation
deﬁned on a subspace in terms of its matrix with respect to the bases B1 and B2.

Deﬁnition 3.1. Suppose T ∈ L(W, V ) and let B ∈ Mn,k(Fq) denote the matrix
of T with respect to the bases B1 and B2. The invariant factors of T are the
invariant factors of xIn,k − B viewed as a polynomial matrix over Mn,k(Fq[x]).

Note that the above deﬁnition coincides with the usual deﬁnition of invariant
factors of a linear transformation in the case W = V . The invariant factors of
T ∈ L(W, V ) are independent of the speciﬁc choice of bases for W and V so long
as the basis for V is obtained as an extension of the basis for W . If p1, . . . , pk are
the invariant factors of T , we write IT = (p1, . . . , pk). Though the terms ‘invariant
factors’ and ‘invariant polynomials’ are often used interchangeably, some authors
refer to the nonunit invariant factors of T as the invariant polynomials of T .

Remark 3.2. While it is possible for an arbitrary element of Mn,k(Fq[x]) to
have less than k invariant factors, a matrix polynomial of the form xIn,k − B for
B ∈ Mn,k(Fq) always has k invariant factors as δk(xIn,k − B) 6= 0. In fact, it is
easily seen that δk(xIn,k − B) is a polynomial of degree at most k.

Deﬁnition 3.3. For any k-tuple I of invariant factors, we deﬁne

Nq(n, k; I) := # {T ∈ L(W, V ) : IT = I} .

The above deﬁnition of Nq(n, k; I) is equivalent to the one given in the intro-

duction. Given T ∈ L(W, V ), deﬁne

I(T ) := the maximal T -invariant subspace contained in W.

The following proposition [6, Thm. III.1.2] relates the invariant factors of T

to the invariant factors of its restriction to I(T ).

Proposition 3.4. For T ∈ L(W, V ), let T ′ denote the restriction of T to its max-
imal invariant subspace I(T ). Then T and T ′ have the same nonunit invariant
factors.

Corollary 3.5. For T ∈ L(W, V ) with IT = (p1, . . . , pk), we have

dim I(T ) = deg

k

Yi=1

pi.

Proof. Denote by T ′ the restriction of T to I(T ) and suppose dim I(T ) = d. Let
A ∈ Mn,k(Fq) denote the matrix of T with respect to the bases B1 and B2 and

LINEAR TRANSFORMATIONS WITH PRESCRIBED INVARIANT FACTORS

5

let A′ ∈ Md(Fq) denote the matrix of T ′ with respect to some basis of I(T ). The
dimension of I(T ) is equal to the degree of the characteristic polynomial of T ′,
i.e.,

dim I(T ) = d = deg det(xId − A′)
= deg δd(xId − A′)
= deg δk (xIn,k − A) .

The last equality follows from Proposition 3.4 since T and T ′ have the same
nonunit invariant factors. Since

δk(xIn,k − A) =

k

Yi=1

pi,

the corollary follows.

(cid:3)

For subspaces U ⊆ W ⊆ V and a tuple I of invariant factors, we deﬁne

N(V, W, U; I) := #{T ∈ L(W, V ) : I(T ) = U, IT = I}.

Then (1) is equivalent to

(2)

N(V, V, V ; I) =

| GLn(Fq)|

Qf ∈S(I) cf (ΦI(f ))

for any n-tuple I = (p1 . . . , pn) of invariant factors with degQn

that N(V, V, U; I) = 0 for all I whenever U is a proper subspace of V .

i=1 pi = n. Note

The next theorem gives an explicit formula for N(V, W, U; I) and is our main
result. A crucial ingredient in the proof is the formula for the number of zero
kernel pairs over a ﬁnite ﬁeld.

Theorem 3.6. Suppose U is a subspace of W and let d, k, n denote the dimen-
sions of U, W, V respectively. Given a k-tuple I = (p1, . . . , pk) of invariant factors

with degQk

i=1 pi = d, we have

N(V, W, U; I) =

(qn − qi).

Yi=d+1

Proof. The case W = V follows easily from (2). Now suppose W ( V . Let
T ∈ L(W, V ) with IT = (p1, . . . , pk). We need to count the number of such T for
which I(T ) = U. Let U ′ be a complementary subspace of W with W = U ⊕ U ′.
Let {v1, . . . , vd} be an ordered basis for U and let {vd+1, . . . , vk} be an ordered
basis for U ′ so that B = {v1, . . . , vk} is a basis of W . We extend this basis
further to a basis B′ = {v1, . . . , vn} of V . We now count linear transformations
by counting their matrices with respect to the bases B and B′. Accordingly, let

(cid:2)A
C(cid:3) ∈ Mn,k(Fq) be the matrix of T with respect to the bases B and B′ for some

A ∈ Mk(Fq) and C ∈ Mn−k,k(Fq). We partition A and C further into blocks

form

where A11 ∈ Md(Fq). Since U is T -invariant, it follows that A21 = 0 ∈ Mk−d,d(Fq)
and C11 = 0 ∈ Mn−k,d(Fq). We thus have

We now need to count the number of tuples (A11, A12, A22, C12) for which the
invariant factors of (3) are precisely p1, . . . , pk. The fact that deg(p1 · · · pk) = d
forces pi = 1 for i ≤ k − d. Since the matrix of T restricted to U is precisely
A11, it follows from Proposition 3.4 that the invariant factors of xId − A11 are
precisely pk−d+1, . . . , pk, i.e.,

(4)

xId − A11 ∼ diagd,d(pk−d+1, . . . , pk).

i=1 pi. Consider the k × k minors of the matrix on
the right hand side of (3). For such a minor to be nonzero, it necessarily contains
all rows of the submatrix [xId − A11 − A12]. Thus, the nonzero k × k minors of

Note that det(xId − A11) = Qk
(cid:2)xIk−A
−C (cid:3) are all divisible by det(xId − A11). Now observe that

δk(cid:18)(cid:20)xIk − A

−C (cid:21)(cid:19) = det(xId − A11) · δk−d(cid:18)(cid:20)xIk−d − A22

−C12

(cid:21)(cid:19) .

(5)

Since det(xId − A11) = Qk

follows that

i=1 pi which also equals the left hand side of (5), it

(6)

δk−d(cid:18)(cid:20)xIk−d − A22

−C12

(cid:21)(cid:19) = 1.

From the preceding discussion, it is clear that if A11 is chosen to satisfy (4),
A22, C12 are chosen to satisfy (6) and A12 is chosen arbitrarily in Md,k−d(Fq),
then T has the desired invariant factors. Conversely, for any T with invariant
factors p1, . . . , pk, the matrices A11, A12, A22, C12 necessarily satisfy (4) and (6).
The number of choices for A11 is precisely Nq(d, d; I(d)) where I(d) denotes the
d-tuple formed by taking the last d coordinates of I. The pair (C12, A22) ∈
Mn−k,k−d(Fq) × Mk−d(Fq) may be chosen to be any zero kernel pair. This can be
i=1 (qn−d − qi) ways ([11, Cor. 3.9]) and A12 can be chosen in qd(k−d)

ways. Thus, the tuple (A11, A12, A22, C12) can be chosen in

ways. It is easy to see that S(I) = S(I(d)) and ΦI(f ) = ΦI(d)(f ) for all f ∈ S(I).
The result now follows by substituting for Nq(d, d; I(d)) from (1).
(cid:3)

Remark 3.7. If we set U to be the zero subspace in the hypothesis of Theo-
rem 3.6, then d = 0 and I is necessarily the k-tuple (1, . . . , 1). In this case I(0)
denotes the null tuple and we adopt the convention that Nq(0, 0, I(0)) = 1 and
| GL0(Fq)| = 1 in the counting formula. We then obtain

N(V, W, {0}, (1, . . . , 1)) =

which is an expression for the number of T ∈ L(W, V ) which have no nonzero
invariant subspace (see [11, Prob. 1.4]).

The number of d-dimensional subspaces of a k-dimensional vector space over

Fq is well-known and given by the q-binomial coeﬃcient

d(cid:21)q
(cid:20)k

:=

(qk − 1)(qk−1 − 1) · · · (qk−d+1 − 1)

(qd − 1)(qd−1 − 1) · · · (q − 1)

.

The following theorem gives a formula for the number of linear transformations
deﬁned on a subspace with a prescribed list of invariant factors.

Theorem 3.8. Let I = (p1, . . . , pk) be a k-tuple of invariant factors and suppose

i=1 pi = d. We have

N(V, W, U0; I),

where U0 is some ﬁxed subspace of W of dimension d. We now use Theorem 3.6
to deduce the result.

The following result gives an expression for the number of linear transforma-
tions which have a given invariant subspace and will be used later on in the proof
of Theorem 4.6.

The last equality follows from the fact that I(d) varies over invariant factors
corresponding to all possible conjugacy classes in Md(Fq) and hence the above
sum counts all elements of Md(Fq).
(cid:3)

Remark 3.10. In contrast with the case of linear operators, the invariant factors
do not form a complete set of similarity invariants for a linear transformation
deﬁned only on a subspace. Recall that if T ∈ L(W, V ) and T ′ ∈ L(W ′, V ′) denote
two linear transformations deﬁned on subspaces W, W ′ of V, V ′ respectively, then
T and T ′ are similar if there exsits a linear isomorphism S : V → V ′ with
S(W ) = W ′ such that the following diagram commutes:

W

S

W ′

T

S≃

V ′

If T and T ′ are similar, then they necessarily have the same invariant factors but
the converse is not true in general. We refer to Gohberg et al. [6, Sec. III.3] or
Ferrer and Puerta [2] for a characterization of similarity invariants in this case.

4. Reachability subspace of a matrix pair

q deﬁned by

q and consider the sequence xs in Fk

denote a ﬁxed column vector in Fk

xs+1 = Axs + Bus

(s ≥ 0),

q

where A ∈ Mk(Fq), B ∈ Mk,n−k(Fq) are ﬁxed and us(s ≥ 0) is some sequence in
Fn−k

linear sequential machines, discrete automata theory and convolutional error cor-
recting codes just to name a few (see [4], [7], [14]). The recurrence is readily

.

It is often required that xk take all possible values in Fk
q by suitably varying the
‘input sequence’ us(0 ≤ s ≤ k − 1). This happens if and only if the controllability
matrix deﬁned by

has full rank k. This motivates the deﬁnition of a reachable pair of matrices.

C(A, B) := (cid:2)B AB · · · Ak−1B(cid:3)

Deﬁnition 4.1. The pair (A, B) ∈ Mk(Fq) × Mk,n−k(Fq) is said to reachable if

rank C(A, B) = k.

The problem of counting the number of reachable pairs (A, B) over a ﬁnite ﬁeld
is equivalent to counting the number of zero kernel pairs and is an interesting
problem in its own right with connections to other combinatorial objects. We
refer to [11] for more on this topic. When the pair (A, B) is not reachable, xk
takes values in an aﬃne subspace of dimension r ≤ k determined by x0 and the
controllability matrix C(A, B). We have the following natural generalization of
the notion of reachability.

Deﬁnition 4.2. The pair (A, B) ∈ Mk(Fq) × Mk,n−k(Fq) is said to have an r-
dimensional reachability subspace if

rank C(A, B) = r.

A natural question at this point is to ask whether there is a simple formula
for the number of matrix pairs with reachability subspace of a given dimension.
This is the question addressed by Theorem 4.6. We ﬁrst establish the connec-
tion between linear transformations deﬁned on a subspace and matrix pairs with
reachability subspace of a given dimension.

Proposition 4.3. Suppose T ∈ L(W, V ) and let the matrix of T with respect to

the bases B1 and B2 be (cid:2)A

C(cid:3) ∈ Mn,k(Fq) for some A ∈ Mk(Fq) and C ∈ Mn−k,k(Fq).

We have an isomorphism of Fq-vector spaces

I(T ) ≃

k−1

\i=0

ker(CAi).

Proof. The proof is similar to that of [11, Prop. 3.2]. For any v ∈ W , let xv ∈ Fk
q
denote the coordinate column vector of v with respect to the basis B1. If v ∈ I(T ),

10

SAMRITH RAM

then T iv lies in I(T ) and hence in W for all i. The coordinate vector of T v with
respect to B2 is

Cxv(cid:21).
C(cid:21)xv = (cid:20)Axv
(cid:20)A

Since T v ∈ W , it follows that Cxv = 0 and the coordinate vector of T v with
respect to B1 is simply Axv. By considering T 2v it follows similarly that CAxv =
0 and hence the coordinate vector of T 2v with respect to B1 is A2xv. Continuing
this line of reasoning, we ﬁnd that CAixv = 0 for 0 ≤ i ≤ k − 1. Thus

xv ∈

k−1

\i=0

ker(CAi),

which proves that

(8)

{xv : v ∈ I(T )} ⊆

k−1

\i=0

ker(CAi).

Conversely, suppose X ∈ Tk−1

i=0 ker(CAi). Let χA(x) denote the characteristic
polynomial of A.
If u is the vector whose coordinates with respect to B1 are
precisely X, then it is easily veriﬁed that χA(T )u is well-deﬁned and equal to
0. Therefore u generates a T -invariant subspace and hence u ∈ I(T ). Thus the
reverse inclusion in (8) holds as well. We thus have

{xv : v ∈ I(T )} =

k−1

\i=0

ker(CAi),

from which the proposition immediately follows.

Corollary 4.5. The pair (A, B) ∈ Mk(Fq) × Mk,n−k(Fq) has a reachability sub-
space of dimension k − dim I(T ) where T : W → V is the linear transformation

deﬁned by declaring the matrix of T with respect to B1 and B2 to be (cid:2)AT

We are now ready to prove the result of Helmke et al. [8, Thm. 2] on matrix

pairs with reachability subspace of a given dimension.

Theorem 4.6. The number of pairs (A, B) ∈ Mk(Fq) × Mk,n−k(Fq) with r-

By Corollary 4.5, this equals

# {T ∈ L(W, V ) : dim I(T ) = d} ,

where d = k − r. As I(T ) could be any d-dimensional subspace of W , the

number of possibilities for I(T ) is clearly (cid:2)k

from Theorem 3.9.

d(cid:3)q = (cid:2)k

r(cid:3)q. The result now follows

(cid:3)

Setting r = k in the above theorem, we ﬁnd that the number of reachable pairs

(A, B) ∈ Mk(Fq) × Mk,n−k(Fq) is given by

k

(qn − qi).

Remark 4.7. Let I1 denote the k-tuple (1, . . . , 1). The formula for the number
of reachable pairs is equivalent to

Nq(n, k; I1) =

k

(qn − qi).

5. An extension of the Gerstenhaber-Reiner formula

It is a remarkable fact that the number of nilpotent matrices in Mn(Fq) is
given by a rather simple formula, namely, qn(n−1). This result is often attributed
to Fine and Herstein [3] but appears to have been known earlier to Philip Hall who
gave two diﬀerent proofs in a series of lectures at the Edinburgh mathematical
colloquium at St. Andrews in 1955 (see [13, p. 618]). Subsequently, the result
was generalized independently by Gerstenhaber [5] and Reiner [12, Thm. 2] who
gave a formula for the number of matrices with a given characteristic polynomial.
In this section, we extend the result of Gerstenhaber and Reiner to the setting of
rectangular matrices.

Let Φn : Mn(Fq) → Fq[x] denote the map which associates to a square n × n
matrix its characteristic polynomial, i.e., Φn(A) = det(xIn − A). The ﬁbers of
Φn can be computed explicitly as the following theorem shows.

Theorem 5.1 (Gerstenhaber-Reiner). For a monic polynomial f (x) ∈ Fq[x] of
degree n, let f = f e1
t denote the canonical factorization of f into distinct
irreducible polynomials fi of degree di(1 ≤ i ≤ t) in Fq[x]. The number of matrices
in Mn(Fq) with characteristic polynomial f is given by

1 · · · f et

|Φ−1

n (f )| = qn2−n

F (q, n)

,

i=1 F (qdi, ei)

Qt

where F (q, r) = Qr

i=1(1 − q−i) for each nonnegative integer r.

We extend this result to rectangular matrices as follows. Deﬁne

by

Φn,k : Mn,k(Fq) → Fq[x]

Φn,k(A) = δk (xIn,k − A) ,

where δk(·) denotes the kth determinantal divisor as before. It is clear that Φn,n
is just the map Φn. The following result gives a formula for the size of the ﬁbers
of Φn,k and may be viewed as an extension of the Gerstenhaber-Reiner formula.

Theorem 5.2. For a monic polynomial f (x) ∈ Fq[x] of degree d ≤ k, let f =
f e1
1 · · · f et
t be the canonical factorization of f into distinct irreducibles fi of degree
di(1 ≤ i ≤ t). We have

d(cid:21)q
n,k(f )(cid:12)(cid:12) = (cid:20)k
(cid:12)(cid:12)Φ−1

qd2−dF (q, d)

(qn − qi).

Proof. We sum over all possible k-tuples (p1, . . . , pk) of monic polynomials in
Fq[x] with pi | pi+1(1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1) and p1 · · · pk = f to obtain

Nq (n, k; (p1, . . . , pk))

n,k(f )(cid:12)(cid:12) = Xp1···pk=f
(cid:12)(cid:12)Φ−1
d(cid:21)q
= (cid:20)k
Yi=d+1

pi|pi+1

k

(qn − qi) Xp1···pk=f

pi|pi+1

Nq(d, d; (pk−d+1, . . . , pk)).

The sum in the last expression is clearly equal to the number of matrices in
Md(Fq) with characteristic polynomial f . Thus

n,k(f )(cid:12)(cid:12) = (cid:20)k
(cid:12)(cid:12)Φ−1

d(cid:21)q(cid:12)(cid:12)Φ−1
d (f )(cid:12)(cid:12)

k

(qn − qi),

Yi=d+1

and the theorem follows by applying the Gerstenhaber-Reiner formula to |Φ−1

d (f )|.
