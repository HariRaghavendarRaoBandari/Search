Degeneracy of entire curves into higher dimensional

complex manifolds

Abstract

Pursuing McQuillan’s philosophy in proving the Green-Griﬃths conjecture for certain
surfaces of general type, we deal with the algebraic degeneracy of entire curves tangent to
holomorphic foliations by curves. Inspired by the recent work [PS14], we study the intersec-
tion of Ahlfors current T [f ] with tangent bundle TF of F , and derive some consequences. In
particular, we introduce the deﬁnition of weakly reduced singularities for foliations by curves,
which requires less work than the exact classiﬁcation for foliations. Finally we discuss the
strategy to prove the Green-Griﬃths conjecture for complex surfaces.

Introduction

In [McQ98], McQuillan proved the following striking theorem:

Theorem 1.1. Let X be a surface of general type and F a holomorphic foliation on X. Then
any entire curve F : C → X tangent to F can not be Zariski dense.

The original proof of Theorem 1.1 is rather involved. Later on, several simpliﬁed proofs
appeared, cf. [Bru99] and [PS14]. The idea in proving Theorem (1.1) is to argue by contradiction.
One assumes that there exists a Zariski dense entire curve f : C → X which is tangent to F.
Then, one studies the intersection of the Ahlfors current T [f ], which can be treated as a (1, 1)-
cohomology class in X, with the tangent bundle and the normal bundle of the foliation F. The

above works proved that both of the intersections numbers are positive. However, since KX is
big, then T [f ] · KX > 0, and by the equality K −1
In our paper, we give a generalization of McQuillan’s result dealing with entire curves on
higher dimensional complex manifolds, by pursuing the same philosophy. Firstly we obtain a
formula for T [f ]· TF , which is an improvement of that of [PS14]. Our ﬁrst result is the following
theorem:
Theorem 1.2. Let (X,F) be a K¨ahler 1-foliated pair. If f : C → X is a transcendental entire
curve (see Deﬁnition 2.2 below) tangent to F whose image is not contained in Sing(F), then

hT [f ], c1(TF )i + T (f,JF ) = hT [f1],OX1 (−1)i ≥ 0,

where JF is a coherent ideal sheaf determined by the singularity of F, and T (f,JF ) is a non-
negative real number representing the “intersection” of T [f ] with JF ; this number will be deﬁned
later.

If X is a complex surface, as is proved by McQuillan, Theorem 1.2 can be improved to the

extent that

T [f ] · TF ≥ 0.

(1.1)

T [ef ] · T eF = 0.

On the one hand, by pursuing his philosophy of “diaphantine approximation”, one can generalize
(1.1) to higher dimensional manifolds, under some assumptions on the foliation:
Theorem 1.3. Let F be a foliation by curves on the n-dimensional complex manifold X, such
that the singular set Sing(F) of the foliation F is a set of absolutely isolated singularities (this
will be deﬁned later). If f : C → X is an Zariski dense entire curve which is tangent to F, then

one can blow-up X a ﬁnite number of times to get a new birational model (eX, eF ) such that

Moreover, if F is a foliation by curves with absolutely isolated singularities that are simple
(see Deﬁnition 2.6), and whose canonical bundle KF is big, then every entire curve f : C → X
that is tangent to F is algebraically degenerate.

On the other hand, Theorem 1.2 leads us to the fact that the error term T (f,JF ) is control-
lable, if the singularities of F are not too “bad” (they are called weakly reduced singularities in
Section 2.5). The theorem is as follows:

Theorem 1.4. Let X be a projective manifold of dimension n endowed with a 1-dimensional
foliation F with weakly reduced singularities. If f is a Zariski dense entire curve tangent to F,
satisfying hT [f ], KXi > 0 (e.g. KX is big), then we have
hT [ ˆf ], c1(N ˆF )i < 0

for some birational pair ( ˆX, ˆF ).
Remark 1.1. Our deﬁnition of “weakly reduced singularities” is actually weaker than the usual
concept of reduced singularities, which always requires a lot of checking (e.g. a classiﬁcation of
singularities). We only need to focus on the multiplier ideal sheaf of JF , instead of trying to
understand the exact behavior of singularities.

2

It is notable that the following strong result due to M. Brunella implies a conclusive contra-

diction in combination with Theorem 1.4, in the case of dimension 2.
Theorem 1.5. Let X be a complex surface endowed with a foliation F (no assumption is made
for singularities of F here). If f : C → X is a Zariski dense entire curve tangent to F, then we
have

hT [f ], NFi ≥ 0.

Therefore, we get another proof of Theorem 1.1 without using the reﬁned formula (1.1) im-
mediately. This leads us to observe that if one can resolve any singularities of the 1-dimensional
foliation F into weakly reduced ones, and generalize the previous Brunella Theorem to higher
dimensional manifolds, one could infer the Green-Griﬃths conjecture for surfaces of general
type.
Theorem 1.6. Assume that Theorem 1.5 holds for a directed variety (X,F) where X is a base
of arbitrary dimension and F has rank 1, and that one can resolve the singularities of F into
weakly reduced ones. Then every entire curve drawn in a projective surface of general type must
be algebraically degenerate.

2 Proof of the Main Theorems

2.1 Notions and deﬁnitions

For any coherent ideal sheaf J ⊂ OX , one can construct a global quasi-plurisubarmonic function
ϕJ on X such that

ϕJ = log(Xi

|gi|2) + O(1)

where (gi) are local holomorphic functions that generate the ideal J . We call ϕJ the charac-
teristic function associated to the coherent sheaf. For any entire curve f which is not contained
in the subscheme Z(J ), we can write

ϕJ ◦ f (t)|B(r) = X|tj |<r

νj log |t − tj|2 + O(1),

and here we call νj the multiplicity of f along J .

In a related way, we deﬁne the proximity function of f with respect to J by

and the counting function of f with respect to J by

mf,J (r) := −

Let us take a log resolution of F with a birational morphism p : ˆX → X such that p−1(J ) =
O ˆX (−D), let ˆf denote the lift of f to ˆX (so that p ◦ ˆf = f ), and let ΘD be the curvature form
of D.

Now we recall the following formula, which will be very useful in what follows.

Then the following First Main Theorem due to Nevanlinna is an immediate consequence.

Theorem 2.2. As r → ∞, one has
T ˆf ,ΘD

(r) = Nf,J (r) + mf,J (r) + O(1).

Let F be a 1-dimension foliation. Then we can take an open covering {Uα}α∈I such that on
each Uα there exists vα ∈ H 0(Uα, TX|Uα) which generates F, and such that the vα coincide up
to multiplication by nowhere vanishing holomorphic functions {gαβ}:

vα = gαβvβ

if Uα ∩ Uβ 6= ∅. The functions {gαβ} deﬁne a cohomology class H 1(X,O∗
X ) that corresponds to
the cotangent bundle of F, denoted here by T ∗
F . Let ω be a hermitian metric on X. Then ω
induces a natural singular metric hs on TF . Indeed, on each Uα the local weight ϕα is given by

the following deﬁnition.

All the constructions explained above can be generalized to log pairs. We ﬁrst begin with

4

Deﬁnition 2.1. Let X be a smooth K¨ahler manifold, D a simple normal crossing divisor and
F a foliation by curves deﬁned on X. We say that F is deﬁned on the log pair (X, D) if each
component of D is invariant by F. For brevity we say that (X,F, D) a K¨ahler 1-foliated triple.
The logarithmic tangent bundle TXh− log Di with respect to the pair (X, D) is the subsheaf

of TX whose local sections are given by

where z1z2 . . . zk = 0 is the local equation of D.

We can take a hermitian metric ωX,D on TXh− log Di deﬁned as follows
ωX,D = √−1

where (ωi¯j) is smooth positive deﬁnite hermitian matrix. In other words, the local model of
ωX,D is given by

ωX,D ≡ √−1

kXi=1

dzi ∧ d¯zi

|zi|2 + +√−1 Xi≥k+1

weight is given by

ϕα,D = − log |vα|2

ωX,D = − logXi,j

αaj

αωij.

We denote by JF ,D the coherent sheaf deﬁned by the functions (aj

α). In general we have

JF ⊂ JF ,D,

and the inclusion may be strict. If we ﬁnd a smooth metric h = hs,De−ϕs,D on TF , then it is
easy to check that ϕs,D is the characteristic function associated with JF ,D.

We set ¯X1 := P (TXh− log Di), then ωX,D induces a natural smooth metric h1 on O ¯X1(−1).

2.2 Basic results about Ahlfors currents

Let X be a compact complex manifold, and let f be an entire curve. Then we can associate a
closed positive current of (n − 1, n − 1) type as follows: for any smooth 2-form η, we let

hTrk [f ], ηi :=

Tf,η(rk)
Tf,ω(rk)

,

5

dt

1

where Tf,ω(r) :=R r

t RB(t) f ∗ω. Here B(t) is the ball of radius t in C and S(t) is its boundary.

It is known that one can ﬁnd a suitable sequence of (rk) that tends to inﬁnity, such that the
weak limit of Trk [f ] is a closed positive current (ref. [Bru99]). It is denoted by T [f ] and called
the Ahlfors current of f . Indeed, to ensure that the weak limit of Trk [f ] is closed, we only need
rk to satisfy the following condition

lim
rk→∞

length(f (S(rk)))
area(f (B(rk)))

= 0.

(*)

Remark 2.1. In the deﬁnition of the Ahlfors current, it is not indispensable to assume ω to be
a K¨ahler form. In fact, it suﬃces to assume that ω is a semi-positive form satisfying

lim
rk→∞

Tf,ω(rk)
Tf,eω(rk)

> C > 0

with respect to some K¨ahler form eω.

If f : C → X is an
Theorem 2.3. Let L be a big line bundle on a K¨ahler manifold X.
entire curve on X such that its image is not contained in the augmented base locus B+(L) of L
(ref. [Laz04]), then hT [f ], c1(L)i > 0.
Proof. Since the image of f is not contained in B+(L), by the deﬁnition of the augmented base
locus one can ﬁnd an eﬀective divisor E whose support does not contain the image of f , such
that

where A is an Q ample divisor, and “≡” means numerically equivalent. Then the counting
function of f with respect to E is non-negative and one can ﬁnd a smooth hermitian metric hE
on E such that the proximity function of f with respect to E is also non-negative. Therefore

L ≡ A + E,

By the ampleness of A, we have

and thus

hT [f ], ΘhE (E)i ≥ 0.

hT [f ], c1(A)i > 0,

hT [f ], c1(L)i = hT [f ], c1(A) + c1(E)i > 0.

Deﬁnition 2.2. An entire curve f : C → X is said to be an algebraic curve iﬀ f admits a
factorization in the form f = g ◦ R, where R : C → P1 is a rational function and g : P1 → X is
a rational curve; otherwise f will be called transcendental.

We have the following criterion for an entire curve to be algebraic (ref. [Dem97]):

Theorem 2.4. Any entire curve f : C → X is an algebraic curve if and only if Tf,ω(r) =
O(log r). In particular, if f is Zariski dense, then
Tf,ω(r)
log r

= +∞.

lim
r→∞

From now on, for brevity we write Tf (r) in place of Tf,ω(r), where ω can be some semi-

positive (1, 1)-form satisfying the condition in Remark 2.1.

The following logarithmic derivative lemma will be very useful in our arguments.

Let (X, V ) be a smooth directed variety. It is easy to see that there is a canonical lift of f
to X1 := P (V ), deﬁned by f1(t) := (f (t), [f ′(t)]) and satisfying π(f1) = f , where π : X1 → X is
the natural projection map. Fix a hermitian metric ω on X. It induces a smooth metric h on
the line bundle OX1(1). Then 0 < δ ≪ 1 , ω1 := π∗ω + δΘh(OX1(1)) is a hermitian metric on
X1, and we have the following lemma:

Lemma 2.1. Assume that f is a transcendental entire curve on X. Let π : X1 → X be the
projection map. Then we have

lim
r→∞

Tf1,π∗ω(r)
Tf1,ω1(r) ≥ 1.

In particular, we can deﬁne the Ahlfors current T [f1] with respect to π∗ω in such a way that
π∗T [f1] = T [f ].

By Remark 2.1 we can replace ω1 by π∗ω in the deﬁnition of Ahlfors current T [f1], and the
equality Tf1,π∗η(r) = Tf,η(r) for any (1, 1) form η then yields

π∗T [f1] = T [f ].

Similarly we have the following lemma:

Lemma 2.2. Let p : Y → X be a bimeromorphic morphism between K¨ahler manifolds X and
Y , obtained by a sequence of blow-ups with smooth centers. If f : C → X is an entire curve

Proof. We ﬁrst ﬁx a K¨ahler metric on X. Since Y is obtained by a ﬁnite sequence of blow-ups,

whose image is not contained in the critical value of p, then we can lift f as ef : C → Y and
deﬁne the Ahlfors current T [ef ] with respect to p∗ω in such a way that p∗T [ef ] = T [f ].
we can ﬁnd a K¨ahler metric eω on Y deﬁned by
eω = p∗ω −Xi

where all Ei are irreducible divisors supported in the exceptional locus of p, hi is some smooth
hermitian metric on Ei, and each ǫi is some positive real number. Since the image of f is not

ǫiΘhi(Ei),

and a fortiori in any of the Ei. We claim that for all Ei we have

contained in the critical value of p, the image of ef is not contained in the exceptional locus of p,
Indeed, since the image of ef is not contained in Ei, the counting function of f with respect to

Ei is non-negative, and if we normalize the hermitian metric hi, the proximity function is also
non-negative. By Nevanlinna’s First Main Theorem, we infer (2.8).

hT [f ], Θhi(Ei)i ≥ 0.

(2.8)

8

Therefore

lim
r→∞

T ef ,p∗ω(r)
T ef ,eω(r) ≥ 1,

and by Remark 2.1 we can deﬁne the Ahlfors current T [ef ] with respect to p∗ω in such a way
that p∗T [ef ] = T [f ].
Remark 2.2. For any coherent ideal sheaf J whose zero scheme does not contain the image of
f : C → X, one can take a log resolution p : ˆX → X of J with p∗J = O ˆX (−D), and by Lemma
2.2 one can ﬁnd a suitable sequence (rk) such that

hT [ ˆf ], Θ(D)i = lim

rk→∞

T ˆf ,Θ(D)(rk)
T ˆf ,p∗ω(rk)

where ˆf is the lift of f to ˆX and Θ(D) is a curvature form of O ˆX(D) with respect to some smooth
metric. By Theorem 2.2, we know that hT [ ˆf ], Θ(D)i does not depend on the log resolution of
J . We will denote this intersection number by T (f,J ).

2.3

Intersection with the tangent bundle

Theorem 2.6. (Tautological inequality) Let f : (C, TC) → (X, V ) be a transcendental entire
curve in X, where (X, V ) is a smooth directed variety. We denote by f1 : C → P (V ) the lift of
f . Let ω be a hermitian metric on X, and consider the smooth metric induced by h on the line
bundle OP (V )(1). Then we have

hT [f1],OP (V )(−1)i = hT [f1], Θh∗(OP (V )(−1))i ≥ 0.

Proof. By (2.7) above we have

lim

r→+∞

Tf,ω(r)Z r

dt

t ZB(t)

f ∗
1 Θh∗(OP (V )(−1)) ≥ 0.

By Lemma 2.1 we can take π∗ω as the semi-positive form used in the deﬁnition of the Ahlfors
current of T [f1], where π : P (V ) → X is the natural projection. The equality Tf,ω(r) =
Tf1,π∗ω(r) then implies

hT [f1],OP (V )(−1)i = lim

r→+∞

Tf1,π∗ω(r)Z r

t ZB(t)

f ∗

Remark 2.3. Recall the following well known formula: if C ⊂ X is a smooth algebraic curve
tautological inequality intuitively means that the “Euler characteristic” of the transcendental
curve f : C → X is non-negative.

and eC ⊂ P (TX ) is its lift to P (TX ), then c1(OP (TX )(−1)) · [eC] = χ(C). Thus the above

Theorem 2.7. Let X be a K¨ahler manifold endowed with a 1-dimensional foliation F, and
f : C → X be a transcendental entire curve tangent to F such that its image is not contained
in Sing(F). Then we have

hT [f ], c1(TF )i + T (f,JF ) = hT [f1], Θg(OX1(−1))i ≥ 0,

(2.9)

where g is the smooth metric on OX1 (−1) induced by ω.
Proof. Let (Uα) be a partition of unit of X, and let us denote Ωα = f −1(Uα). Then we have

f ′(τ ) = λα(τ )vα|f (τ )

(2.10)

for some holomorphic function λα(τ ) on Ωα\f −1(Sing(F)) (notice that f −1(Sing(F))∩Ωα is a set
of isolated points since its image is not contained in Sing(F)). We denote by ηj the multiplicities
of λα(τ ) at tj (they may be negative if f (tj) ∈ Sing(F), however we have ηj + νj ≥ 0), where νj
is the multiplicity of f along JF , i.e.

ddc log |vα|2

ω ◦ f (τ )|B(r) = X|tj |<r

νj log |τ − tj|2 + O(1).

Since vα = gαβvβ, then if tj ∈ Ωα ∩ Ωβ, λα and λβ have the same multiplicity at tj, and thus ηj
does not depend on the partition on unity. By the Lelong-Poincar´e formula and (2.10) we have

where Nf,JF (r) and mf,JF (r) are the counting and proximity function of f with respect to JF ,
and the second equality above is a consequence of the Jensen formula. Since T [f ] is the weak
limit of the positive current Trk [f ] for some sequence rk → ∞, we have

hT [f ], Θh(TF )i = lim

rk→+∞hTrk [f ], Θh(TF )i.

From Theorem 2.2, Remark 2.2 and Lemma 2.1 we conclude that

hT [f ], Θh(TF )i + T (f,JF ) = hT [f1], Θg(OX1 (−1))i ≥ 0.

In fact, KF ⊗ JF is the canonical sheaf KF of F deﬁned in [Dem14], by using admissible

metric. We recall the following deﬁnition in [Dem14].

Deﬁnition 2.3. We say that the canonical sheaf KF is “ big” if there exists some birational
morphism να : (Xα,Fα) → (X,F) of (X,F) such that the invertible sheaf µ∗
αKFα is big in the
usual sense for some log resolution µα : Yα → Xα of JFα. The base locus Bs(F) of F is deﬁned
to be

αKFα),
where (Xα,Fα) varies among all the birational models with µ∗

να ◦ µαB+(µ∗

Bs(F) :=\α

αKFα big.

The above Theorem 2.7 then gives another proof of the following Generalized Green-Griﬃths
conjecture for rank 1 foliations formulated in [Dem12]. Moreover we can specify more precisely
the subvariety containing the images of all transcendental curves tangent to the foliation. The
theorem is as follows:

Corollary 2.1. Let (X,F) be a projective 1-foliated manifold and assume that KF is big. If
f : C → X is a transcendental entire curve tangent to F, its image must be contained in
Sing(F)∪ Bs(F). In particular, any entire curve tangent to F must be algebraically degenerate.

11

Proof. Assume that the image of f is not contained in Sing(F) ∪ Bs(F). We proceed by con-
tradiction. By Deﬁnition 2.3, there exists a birational morphism να : (Xα,Fα) → (X,F) such
that the invertible sheaf µ∗
αKFα is big in the usual sense, for some log resolution µα : Yα → Xα
of JFα, and such that the image of fα is not contained in B+(µ∗
αKFα), where fα is the lift of f
to Yα. We denote by efα the lift of f to Xα. By Theorem 2.3 we have
By Remark 2.2 and the fact that να∗T [fα] = T [efα]i, we get
hT [efα], KFαi − T (efα,JFα) = hT [fα], µ∗
hT [efα], TFαi + T (efα,JFα) ≥ 0,

and the contradiction is obtained by observing that c1(KFα) = −c1(TFα ).
Remark 2.4. In [Den15] we have generalized the above theorem to any singular directed variety
(X, V ) (without assuming V to be involutive), by applying the Ahlfors-Schwarz Lemma. In the
proof, the canonical sheaf plays a crucial role (and it arises in a natural way).

However, since f is transcendental, by Theorem 2.7 we infer

hT [fα], c1(µ∗

αKFα)i > 0.

αKFαi > 0.

By a result due to Takayama (ref. [Tak08]) we know that on a projective manifold X of
It is natural to ask the

general type, every irreducible component of B+(KX ) is uniruled.
following analogous question:

Problem 2.1. Let (X,F) be a projective 1-foliated pair with KF big.
component of Bs(F) uniruled?

Is every irreducible

From (2.9), we see that the positivity of T [f ] · TF is controlled by the error term T (f,JF ).
This gives us the advantage that we only need to compute the coherent ideal sheaf JF instead
of knowing the exact form of F at the singularities.
Remark 2.5. If X is a complex surface endowed with a foliation F, and C is an algebraic curve,
then by Proposition 2.3 in [Bru04] we have the formula:

C · TF + Z(F, C) = χ(C),

(2.13)

where Z(F, C) is the multiplicity of the singularities of F along the curve C. By Remark 2.3,
we know that hT [f1],OX1 (−1)i can be seen as the “Euler characteristic” of f . Thus (2.9) is
a transcendental version of the above formula, and we have the following metamathematical
correspondences between any algebraic leaf C and any transcendental leaf f : C → X:

Z(F, C) ∼ T (f,JF ),
C · TF ∼ hT [f ], c1(TF )i,
χ(C) ∼ hT [f1],OX1 (−1)i.

We also need the following logarithmic version of Theorem 2.7:

12

Theorem 2.8. Let (X,F, D) be a K¨ahler 1-foliated triple, and let f : C → X be a transcendental
entire curve tangent to F such that its image is not contained in Sing(F)∪|D|, where |D| is the
support of D. Then we have

hT [f ], c1(TF )i + T (f,JF ,D) = hT [ ¯f1],O ¯X1(−1)i ≥ − lim inf
where ¯f1 is the lift of f on ¯X1 := P (TXh− log Di), and N (1)

Proof. Since the image of f is not contained in |D|, the condition that f (tj) ∈ D implies
f (tj) ∈ Sing(F).

on X. On each Uα we have

order at least 1 at tj, and such a pole can only occur at a point of Sing(F).

and the theorem follows from (2.17).

2.4 Siu’s reﬁned tautological inequality

In [Siu02] Y-T. Siu proved McQuillan’s “reﬁned tautological inequality” by applying the tradi-
tional function-theoretical formulation. We will give here an improvement of this result. First
we begin with the following lemma due to Siu.

such that f ∗σ is not identically zero on C. Let W be the zero divisor of σ in X1 := P (TX ), and
π : Y → X be the blow-up of Z with E := π−1(Z). Then we have

we divide τ by s⊗l

projection to X. We denote by Pσ the corresponding section of σ in H 0(X1,OX1 (l) ⊗ p∗(klH)),

Theorem 2.10. Let X be a K¨ahler manifold of dimension n and f : C → X be a transcendental
entire curve. Then for any ﬁnite set Z we have

f,mZ ≥ m(f, mZ ) := lim

r→∞

mf,mZ (r)
Tf,ΘH (r)

.

Proof. First we choose k large enough, in such a way that OX1(1) ⊗ p∗(kH) is ample over X1.
When we choose l suﬃcient large, OX1(l) ⊗ p∗(lkH) will be very ample over X1. Hence there
exists a section σ ∈ H 0(X1,OX1 (l) ⊗ p∗(lkH)) whose defect is zero, i.e.

N (f1, W ) := lim
rk→∞

Nf1,W (rk)
Tf,ΘH (rk)

= hT [f1],OX1(l) ⊗ p∗(lkH)i = hT [f1],OX1 (l)i + kl,

where W is the zero divisor of σ, and where the last equality comes from hT [f ], ΘHi = 1. Since
f is transcendental, by Theorem 2.4 we have

lim

Tf,ΘH (r)

log r

We can thus divide both sides in (2.18) by Tf,ΘH (r) and take r → ∞ to obtain

f,mZ ≤ k,

and we obtain the formula in the theorem.

2.5

Intersection with the normal bundle

As an application for Theorem 2.7, we will study the intersection of T [f ] with the normal bundle;
i.e. with c1(NF ). Before anything else, we begin with the following deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 2.4. Let X be a K¨ahler manifold endowed with a foliation F by curves. We say
that F has weakly reduced singularities if

1. For some log resolution π : ˆX → X of JF , we have T ˆF = π∗TF , where ˆF is the induced

foliation of π∗F;

2. the L2 multiplier ideal sheaf I(JF ) of JF is equal to OX , i.e., at each p ∈ X, assume that

v is the local generator of F around p, then for any f ∈ OX,p, we have

|f|2
|v|2

ω ∈ L1

loc,

where ω is any smooth hermitian metric on X.

With the previous deﬁnition, we have the following theorem.

17

Theorem 2.11. Let X be a projective manifold of dimension n endowed with a foliation F by
curves with weakly reduced singularities. If f : C → X is a transcendental entire curve tangent
to F, whose image is not contained in Sing(F) and satisﬁes hT [f ], KXi > 0 (e.g. KX is big),
then we have

hT [ ˆf ], c1(N ˆF )i < 0

for some birational modiﬁcation ( ˆX, ˆF ) of (X,F).
Proof. From the standard short exact sequence

that holds outside of a codimension 2 subvariety, we ﬁnd

0 −→ TF −→ TX −→ NF −→ 0

By the deﬁnition of multiplier ideal sheaves (ref. [Laz04]) we have

c1(KX ) + c1(TF ) = −c1(NF ).

I(JF ) = π∗(K ˆX/X − D),

where π : ˆX → X is a log resolution of JF such that π∗JF = O ˆX (−D). We know that
I(JF ) = OX if and only if K ˆX/X − D is eﬀective. By the assumption that the image of f is
not contained in Sing(F), i.e. in the zero scheme of JF , we know that the image of ˆf is not
contained in the support of the exceptional divisor, and thus
hT [ ˆf ], K ˆX/X − Di ≥ 0.

Therefore we have

hT [ ˆf ], K ˆX + T ˆFi = hT [ ˆf ], π∗KX + π∗TF + K ˆX/Xi

≥ hT [ ˆf ], π∗KX + π∗TF + Di
= hT [f ], KX + TFi + T (f,JF ),

where the last equality follows from the fact that π∗T [ ˆf ] = T [f ] and T (f,JF ) = hT [ ˆf ], Di (see
Remark 2.2). By Theorem 2.7 we have

hT [f ], TFi + T (f,JF ) ≥ 0,

thus

−hT [ ˆf ], c1(N ˆF )i = hT [ ˆf ], K ˆX + T ˆFi ≥ hT [f ], KXi > 0.

The theorem is proved.

By the reduction theorem of singularities for surface foliations due to Seidenberg, for any
pair (X0,F0) there exists a ﬁnite sequence of blow-ups such that the induced pair (X,F) has
singularities of one of the following two types:

18

• a non-degenerate singular point x0, in the sense that

log |a1|2 + |a2|2

|z1|2 + |z2|2 = O(1).

• a degenerate singular point x1 “of type k”, such that

log |a1|2 + |a2|2

|z1|2 + |z2|2k = O(1),

where k ≥ 2 (we also call this a “type k” singularity).

Moreover

• Any singular point of F is either non-degenerate or degenerate of type k.
• For any blow-up π : ˆX → X of a point on X, we have π∗TF = T ˆF for the induced foliation

ˆF .

• For any blow-up of the non-degenerate point x0, ˆF has two singularities on the exceptional

divisor and both of them are non-degenerate.

• For the blow-up of a degenerate point x1 of type k, on the exceptional divisor ˆF has a

non-degenerate singular point and a degenerate one with the same type as x1.

By the property above it is easy to show that I(JF ) = OX if F is reduced, thus F is weakly
reduced in the sense of Deﬁnition 2.4. Then we can get another proof of McQuillan’s theorem
without using his “Diophantine approximation analysis” (still, we will make use of “Diophantine
approximation” in the next section):

Theorem 2.12. Let X be a complex surface endowed with a foliation F. If hT [f ], KXi > 0
(e.g. if KX is big), then any entire curve tangent to F is algebraically degenerate.
Proof. Assume that we have a Zariski dense entire curve f : C → X tangent to F. We proceed
by contradiction.

By Seidenberg’s theorem there is a sequence of blow-ups π : eX → X such that the singular-
ities of eF = π−1F are reduced, and the lift ef of f to eX is still Zariski dense. Thus eJ is weakly

reduced and by Theorem 2.11 we have

hT [ ˆf ], c1(N ˆF )i < 0

for some birational pair ( ˆX, ˆF ) which is obtained by resolving the ideal J eF . However, Theorem
1.5 tells us that

hT [ ˆf ], c1(N ˆF )i ≥ 0

and we get a contradiction.

19

2.6 A generalization of McQuillan’s theorem

Thanks to the above theorems, we can obtain certain generalizations of McQuillan’s theorem to
higher dimensional manifolds, under some assumptions for the foliations. We start with some
relevant deﬁnitions and properties (and refer to [CCS97] and [Tom97] for further details).

Deﬁnition 2.5. Let F be a foliation by curves on a n-dimensional complex manifold X. We say
that p0 ∈ Sing(F) is an absolutely isolated singularity (A.I.S.) of F if and only if the following
properties are satisﬁed:

1. p0 is an isolated singularity,

2. If we consider an arbitrary sequence of blowing-up’s

(X,F)

π1←− (X1,F1)

π2←− ··· πn←− (Xn,Fn)

where the center of each blow-up πi is a singular point pi−1 ∈ SingFi−1, then #Sing(Fn) <
+∞.

Since locally the foliation F is generated by a holomorphic vector ﬁeld v =Pn

, we
can deﬁne the algebraic multiplicity mp(F) of F at p to be the minimum of the vanishing orders
ordp(ai). Recall that the linear part of F at p is deﬁned by
p → mp/m2
p.

Lv : mp/m2

i=1 ai

∂
∂zi

where π is the blow-up of p. Otherwise p is called a dicritical singularity.

A singular point p ∈ SingF is called reduced if mp(F) = 1 and the linear part of F at p has at
least one non-zero eigenvalue.
We shall say that p ∈ SingF is a non-dicritical singularity of F if π−1(p) is invariant by F,
Let (X,F, D) be a 1-foliated triple. We assume that all singularities of F lie on D (this
can be achieved after we take a log resolution of JF ). Fix a point p ∈ Sing(F) and denote by
e = e(D, p) the number of irreducible components of D through p. Since Sing(F) ⊂ D, we have
e ≥ 1. Then the vector ﬁelds which generate F are given by

where z1z2 . . . ze = 0 is the local equation of D at p.

possibilities occurs:

(A) a1(0) = 0, the curve (z2 = . . . = zn = 0) is invariant by F (up to an adequate formal choice

of coordinates) and the linear part Lv|D of v|D is of rank n − 1.

(B) a1(0) = λ 6= 0, the multiplicity of the eigenvalue λ is one and if µ is another eigenvalue of

the linear part of Lv, then µ

(b-1) if p is a simple point, there is exactly one simple point p′ ∈ eF ∩ µ−1(p). The other
points in eF ∩ µ−1(p) are simple corners. Moreover, p and p′ have the same type (A)
(b-2) If p is a simple corner, then all points in Sing(F) ∩ µ−1(p) are simple corners.
In [Tom97] and [CCS97], the following resolution theorem for absolutely isolated singularities

2. (Xn,Fn, Dn) is a 1-foliated triple with only simple singularities (which are, of course ab-

solutely isolated singularities).

3. All the singularities of Fn are non-dicritical.

Rrk (1) ∈ Crk×rk is the upper triangle matrix of order 1).
Moreover, if we denote by eF the induced foliation of F after the blow-up at p, then we have

Deﬁnition 2.7. Let F be a foliation by curves deﬁned on some open domain U ⊂ Cn. A
separatrix of the singular holomorphic foliation F at the point p ∈ Sing(F) is a local leaf L ⊂

We can summarize Proposition 2.1 and Proposition 2.2 to state a proposition in the following

ﬁnal form:

Proposition 2.3. Let (X,F, D) be a 1-foliated triple. Let p be an absolutely isolated and simple
singularity of F and let w1w2 . . . we = 0 be the local equation of D at p. Then we can ﬁnd a

are stable under blowing-up.

As a consequence of Proposition 2.3 we get the following theorem:

Theorem 2.14. With the above notation, let p be an absolutely isolated and simple singularity
of F and let z1z2 . . . ze = 0 be the local equation of D at p. Then
(a) if p is a simple corner (i.e. e ≥ 2), each separatrix of F at p must be contained in D.

E, and C be a separatrix at p which is not contained in D. If p is a simple point (i.e. e = 1),

(b) Let (eX, eF, eD) be the induced 1-foliated triple by the blow-up at p with the exceptional divisor
then the lift eC of each separatrix C to eX intesects with E at ep1, which is still a simple point
with respect to (eX, eF , eD).

Proof. Assume that we have a separatrix C of F at p which is not contained in D. We take a
local parametrization f : (C, 0) → (C, p) for this separatrix, then in the local coordinate system
(z1, . . . , zn) introduced in Proposition 2.3, we have

(cid:0)f ′

1(t), . . . , f ′

n(t)(cid:1) = η(t) · (f1(t)a1(f ), . . . , fe(t)ae(f ), ae+1(f ), . . . , an(f ))

22

for some meromorphic function η(t) whose poles only appear at 0. By the assumption that C
is not contained in D, fi(t) is not identically equal to zero for i = 1, . . . , e. We denote by νi the
vanishing order of fi(t) at 0 for i = 1 . . . , n, which are all positive integers.

If p is a simple corner, then e ≥ 2 and λ2 = a2(0) 6= 0, and we have

η(t)a2(t) =

f ′
2(t)
f2(t)

.

This implies that the order of pole of η(t) at 0 must be 1. If we denote by η(t) = b(t)
some germ of holomorphic function satisfying b(0) 6= 0, then

t with b(t)

Similarly we have

b(0) · λ2 = ν2.

thus λ1
λ2
must be contained in D, and p only can be a simple point (i.e. e = 1).

ν2 ∈ Q+, which is a contradiction. Therefore any separatrix at the simple corner

= ν1

b(0) · λ1 = ν1 > 0,

Suppose now that p is a simple point. Since eC ∩ E ∈ Sing(eF ) ∩ E = {ep1, . . . ,eps+k}, we can
assume that eC ∩ E = {epl} for some l ≥ 2. Since epl is the zero at the charts ezj = zj,ezi = zi/zj
for i = 1, . . . , n and j = l if l ≤ s or j = s + r1 + . . . + rm−1 + 1 if l = s + m, the lift ef (t) of f (t)

Hence we have

νi > νcl

for i 6= cl. Therefore from the linear part of acl we have

acl(f (t)) = λclfcl(t) + higher order term,

where the higher order term is with respect to t. Thus we can denote by η(t) = b(t)
b(0) 6= 0, and

t with

b(0) · λcl = νcl,

which implies

thus λ1
λcl

= ν1

νcl ∈ Q+. This is a contradiction, and claim (b) of the theorem is proved.

b(0) · λ1 = ν1 > 0,

Thanks to the previous theorem, we can prove the following result, which can be seen as a

generalization of McQuillan’s “Diaphantine approximation”.

Proof. First we assume that all singularities of F are simple and non-dicritical, and that the
linear forms of the generator of F are like those described in Proposition 2.3. Then, by Deﬁnition

hT [fk], c1(TFk )i + T (fk,JFk,Dk ) ≥ −N (1)(fk, Sing(Fk) ∩ Dk),

where N (1)(fk, Sing(Fk) ∩ Dk) is the truncated counting function. By Theorem 2.14 (a) we
know that the image of f contains no simple corners, otherwise f (C) would be contained in D;
therefore simple corners do not contribute to N (1). If p ∈ f (C) for the unique simple point p,
then Theorem 2.14 (b) tells us that fk(C) ∩ Sing(Fk) = {pk}, and thus

T [fk] · c1(TFk ) = T [f ] · c1(TF ),

Now we come to the general case: there are some singularities which may not be simple
singularities. By Theorem 2.13 we can take a ﬁnite sequence of blow-ups with centers only

at singularities, to get a new 1-foliated triple (eX, eF , eD) with simple singularities which are all

non-dicritical. By the proof above we have

T [ef ] · c1(K eF ) ≥ 0.

However, a theorem of Brunella implies that K eF is pseudo-eﬀective, since eF contains a

If we combine the two inequalities, we obtain

3 Towards the Green-Griﬃths conjecture

In order to pursue the similar strategy and prove the Green-Griﬃths conjecture for any complex
surface X of general type, one needs to know the existence of a 1-dimensional foliation directing
any given Zariski dense entire curve f : C → X. The condition of c1(X)2 − c2(X) > 0 ensures
the existence of multi-foliation on X such that any entire curve should be tangent to it. The
diﬃculty in proving the general case is that, we can not ensure that there exists such a (multi)-
foliation on X itself. However, inspired by a very recent work of Demailly [Dem15], we believe
that his deﬁnition of a variety “strongly of general type” is in some sense akin to the construction
of foliations. Although one cannot construct foliations on X directly, one can prove the existence
of some special multi-foliations in certain Demailly-Semple tower of X. Indeed, in [Dem10] the
following theorem has been proved:

Theorem 3.1. Let (X, V ) be a directed variety of “general type” (cf. [Dem12] for the deﬁnition
of general type when V is singular), then OXk (m) ⊗ π∗
k )A) is big thus
has sections for m ≫ k ≫ 1, where Xk is the k-th stage of Demailly-Semple tower of X and A
is an ample divisor on X.

k,0O(− m

kr (1 + 1

2 + . . . + 1

By the Fundamental Vanishing theorem we know that for every entire curve f : C → X, the

k-jet fk : C → Xk satisﬁes

fk(C) ⊂ Bs(H 0(Xk,OXk (m) ⊗ π∗

k,0A−1)) ( Xk.

Assume that we have an entire curve f : (C, TC) → (X, TX )) such that its image in X is
Zariski dense. By the above theorem of Demailly, there exists an N > 0 such that the lift of f on
the N th-stage Demailly-Semple tower can not be Zariski dense in XN , therefore we can ﬁnd an
integer k ≥ 0 such that fj is Zariski dense in Xj for each 0 ≤ j ≤ k, while the Zariski closure of
the image of fk+1 is Z ( Xk+1 which project onto Xk. Since rankTX = 2, Z is a divisor of Xk+1.
From the relation between Pic(Xk) and Pic(X) we know that OXk (Z) ≃ OXk (a) ⊗ π∗
k,0(B), for

26

some B ∈ Pic(X), a ∈ Zk and ak = m. Therefore the projection πk+1,k : Z → Xk is a ramiﬁed
m : 1 cover, which deﬁnes a rank 1 multi-foliation Fk ⊂ Vk on Xk, and fk : (C, TC) → (Xk, Vk)
is tangent to this foliation. We deﬁne the linear subspace W ⊂ TZ ⊂ TXk+1|Z to be the closure

W := TZ ′ ∩ Vk+1

taken on a suitable Zariski open set Z ′ ⊂ Zreg where the intersection TZ ′ ∩ Vk+1 has constant
rank and is a subbundle of TZ ′. As is observed in [Dem15], we know that rankW = 1 which is an
1-dimensional foliation. We ﬁrst resolve the singularities of Z to get a birational model (eZ, eF )
of (Z, W ) such that eZ is smooth, then by the assumption in Theorem 1.6 we take a further
ﬁnite sequence of blow-ups to get a new birational model (Y,F) of (eZ, eF ), such that F has only

weakly reduced singularities. We now obtain a generically ﬁnite morphism p : Y → Xk, and
the lift of f to Y denoted by g : C → Y is still a Zariski dense curve tangent to F satisfying
g = p ◦ fk. Then we have

KY ∼ p∗KXk + R,

where R is an eﬀective divisor whose support is contained in the ramiﬁcation locus of p. We
will call Xk the critical Demailly-Semple tower for f .

Now we state our conjectures about reduction of singularities to weakly reduced ones, and

the generalization of Brunella Theorem to higher dimensional manifolds:

Conjecture 3.1. Let X be a K¨ahler manifold equipped with a foliation F by curves. Then one
weakly reduced singularities.

can obtain a new birational model (eX, eF ) of (X,F) by taking ﬁnite blowing-ups such that eF has

Remark 3.1. From Proposition 2.3 it is easy to show that foliations with absolutely isolated
singularities can be resolved into weakly reduced ones after ﬁnite blowing-ups.

Conjecture 3.2. Let (X,F) be a K¨ahler 1-foliated pair. Suppose that there is a Zariski dense
entire curve f : C → X tangent to F, then we have

T [f ] · c1(det NF ) ≥ 0.

Remark 3.2. If the singular set of F is not discrete, it is diﬃcult to construct a smooth
2-form in c1(det NF ) as that appearing in Baum-Bott Formula (see Chapter 3 in [Bru04]).
Probably we should ﬁnd some representation in the leafwise cohomology, i.e. cohomology group
for laminations.

Based on the conjectures above, we can prove the Green-Griﬃths conjecture for complex

surfaces:

Proof of Theorem 1.6. Since we have

det TXk = kπ∗

k,0 det TX ⊗ OXk (k + 1, k, . . . , 2),

πk,j∗T [fk] = T [fj]

for k ≥ j,

27

by the tautological inequality and the condition of general type we have

hT [fk], det TXki = −

Thus we obtain

kXj=1

(k − j + 2)hT [fj],OXj (−1)i − khT [f ], KXi < 0.

hT [g], KY i = hT [fk], KXki + hT [g], Ri > 0.

Conjecture 3.1 tells us that we can ﬁnd a new birational pair ( ˆY , ˆF ) of (Y,F) with weakly
reduced singularities, then by Theorem 1.4 we have

which is a contradiction to Conjecture 3.2, thus any entire curve must be algebraic degenerate.

hT [ˆg], c1(N ˆF )i < 0,
