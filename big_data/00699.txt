In this paper, we constrain four time-dependent dark energy (TDDE) models by using the Type Ia
supernovae (SNe Ia), baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO), observational Hubble parameter (OHD)
data-sets as well as the single data point from the newest event GW150914. Subsequently, adopt-
ing the best ﬁtting values of the model parameters, we apply the original stateﬁnder, stateﬁnder
hierarchy, the growth rate of matter perturbations and Om(z) diagnostics to distinguish the TDDE
scenarios and the ΛCDM scenario from each other. We discover that all the TDDE models and
ΛCDM model can be distinguished better at the present epoch by using the stateﬁnder hierarchy
than using the original stateﬁnder, the growth rate of matter perturbations and Om(z) diagnostics,
especially, in the planes of {S(1)

INTRODUCTION

Modern astrophysical observations such as the measurements of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), the cosmic microwave
background (CMB) anisotropy, the baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) measurement from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS) and so on, have conﬁrmed our universe is undergoing a phase of accelerated expansion at the present
epoch [1–3]. In the past few years, cosmologists have introduced an additional component in the matter and energy
sector, named dark energy, to explain the accelerated mechanism. The simplest and most attractive candidate of dark
energy is the so-called ΛCDM model [4], which has been proved to be very successful in describing many aspects of the
observed universe. The newest results of Planck 2015 for the ΛCDM cosmology have shown that all the conclusions,
as in its 2013 analysis, are in good agreement with the JLA sample of SNe Ia and BAO data-sets [5]. However,
besides the observed H(z) anomaly, one of the other anomalies the amplitude of ﬂuctuation spectrum is still found
to be higher than deduced from the analysis of weak gravitational lensing and rich cluster counts. At the same time,
the authors also show that the tensions can not be resolved with some simple modiﬁcations of the ΛCDM model. In
addition, this model also faces two fatal detects, i.e., the “ coincidence ” problem and the “ ﬁne-tuning ” problem [4].
The former implies why the amounts of the dark matter and dark energy are at the same order today since the scaling
behavior of the energy densities are substantially diﬀerent during the evolution of the universe by global ﬁtting, while
the latter indicates that the measured energy density of the vacuum is much smaller than the theoretical prediction
value, which is the so-called 120-orders-of-magnitude discrepancy that makes the vacuum explanation so suspicious.
Thus, the the actual nature and cosmological origin of dark energy might not be the cosmological constant Λ in the
standard cosmological model. Based on this concern, in recent years, theorists have proposed many alternatives to
explain the dark energy phenomenon including phantom [6], quintessence [7–15], quintom [16], bulk viscosity [17–23],
generalized Chaplygin gas (GCG) [24, 25], modiﬁed Chaplygin gas (MCG) [26, 27], superﬂuid Chaplygin gas (SCG)
[28–30], decaying vacuum [31], time-dependent dark energy (TDDE) [32–39], holographic dark energy (HDE) [40–43],
Ricci dark energy (RDE) [44–47], holographic tachyon model [48, 49], f(R) gravity [50–53], scalar-tensor theories of
gravity [54–60], Gauss-Bonnet gravity [61–64], Einstein-Aether gravity [65, 66], braneworld models [67–70], etc.

Since so many dark energy models have been proposed, it becomes substantially important and constructive to
discriminate them from the ΛCDM model and one from the other in order to ﬁnd better scenarios. As is well known,
one can think of the expansion rate of the universe as the Hubble parameter H = ˙a/a, where a is the scale factor,
while the rate of the universe acceleration can be explained by the deceleration parameter

q = − ¨a

aH 2 = − a¨a
˙a2 .

Nonetheless, the Hubble parameter H and the deceleration parameter q cannot diﬀerentiate various dark energy
models more accurately since all the models will lead to the same result, namely, ¨a > 0 and H > 0 or q < 0.
Moreover, the gradually mounting observation data-sets with higher precision and more advanced statistical methods
force us to invoke some newer and more eﬀective quantities to surpass the two original quantities. Therefore, naturally,
an interesting and appealing question occurs: how can one diﬀerentiate various kinds of dark energy cosmological
models more explicitly and eﬃciently ? In order to solve this problem, recently, a new geometrical diagnostic called
stateﬁnder is proposed in [71, 72], which involves the third derivative of the scale factor a. The stateﬁnder {r, s} can
be deﬁned as follows:

r =

...
a
aH 3 ,

r − 1

3(q − 1/2)

.

s =

(2)

As usual, one can plot the corresponding trajectories for various dark energy models in the r − s plane in order to
investigate qualitatively the diﬀerent behaviors. For the ΛCDM model, the stateﬁnder pair corresponds to the ﬁxed
point {1, 0}, which can be regarded as a basic point to measure the distance of any given dark energy model from
the standard cosmological model. Recently, the stateﬁnder has been used to discriminate a great deal of dark energy
models, for instance, quintessence [73–75], quintom [76], parametrization models for eﬀective pressure [77], purely
kinetic k-essence (PKK) model [78], GCG [79–81], HDE [82, 83], RDE [84], agegraphic dark energy (ADE) model
[85], spatial Ricci dark energy model (SRDE) [86], Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) gravity [87, 88], Galileon modiﬁed
gravity [89], HDE in the DGP braneworld [90], etc.

Apart from the stateﬁnder, another useful diagnostic, namely, the Om(z) diagnostic [91], has been applied into
discriminating diﬀerent dark energy models. The Om(z) method can be constructed from the Hubble parameter
H(z) and it remains invariable at diﬀerent stages of the universe for the ΛCDM model. Therefore, this diagnostic
gives a simple null test to discriminate the ΛCDM scenario from the evolving dark energy models, since the values
of Om(z) for various cosmological models are the functions of the redshift. Furthermore, according to Ref. [91], one
can also obtain the conclusion that Om(z) does not use any information about the evolution of inhomogeneities in
the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) background, and can not discriminate between large and small values of
the cosmological constant unless the value of matter density has been independently known. In addition, it is worth
mentioning that Om(z) is a relatively sketchy diagnostic which just depends on a knowledge of the Hubble parameter
and can be determined well with currently observational data-sets. Lately, the Om(z) diagnostic has been adopted
to distinguish various dark energy models from the so-called ΛCDM model, for instance, phantom [91], quintessence
[91], parametrization models for eﬀective pressure [77], PKK [78], HDE [82], and SRDE [86]. An attractive extension
of the Om(z) diagnostic, named Om3(z) diagnostic [92], which is reconstructed from the SNe Ia and BAO date-sets,
has provided a powerful null diagnostic for the ΛCDM scenario from the other cosmological scenarios. The Om3(z)
diagnostic, acting as a three-point diagnostic tool of the dark energy cosmological models, is very closely related to the
Om(z) diagnostic, and follows the same basic principles. However, the Om3(z) method has a unique advantage, i.e.,
its value does not depend on either the distance to the last scattering surface or the present-day values of the Hubble
parameter H(z) and the matter density parameter Ωm. Hence, the uncertainties of these observational quantities,
will not have an eﬀect on the reconstruction of the Om3(z) diagnostic. For this method, it is necessary to point out
that we need the more accurate data such as the BigBoss experiment, in order to put more tighter constraints on the
Om3(z) diagnostic, since the uncertainties of the presently available BAO data is substantially large.

Since the original stateﬁnder parameters are only related to the third derivative of scale factor, one may not
distinguish well various dark energy models from each other. Therefore, Arabsalmani et al. propose an extended null
diagnostic for the base cosmology scenario, namely, the stateﬁnder hierarchy, which contains the higher derivatives
of scale factor. They demonstrate that, for the base cosmology scenario, all the members of the stateﬁnder hierarchy
can be expressed in terms of the elementary functions of the deceleration parameter q, consequently and of the matter
density parameter Ωm. This feature can be employed to discriminate better the evolving dark energy models from the
ΛCDM model, since the stateﬁnder hierarchy also remain pegged at one ﬁxed point as the stateﬁnder diagnostic and
Om(z) diagnostic during the evolution of the universe. For instance, in paper [78], the authors have demonstrated
that one can not discriminate the PKK model from the ΛCDM model in terms of 68.3% conﬁdence level through
adopting the Om(z) method and stateﬁnder pair {r, s}. Subsequently, Li et al. [93] exhibit that they can distinguish
well the PKK model from the ΛCDM model as well as other dark energy models by adopting the stateﬁnder hierarchy
and the growth rate of matter perturbations. Thus, these two methods can act as the starting point of our work. In
this situation, we would like to use the Om(z) diagnostic, the stateﬁnder hierarchy and the growth rate of matter
perturbations to distinguish four diﬀerent time-dependent dark energy models from the ΛCDM model, and one from
the other, in order to ﬁnd better ones as the following examples.

This paper is organized as follows: In the next section, we will make a brief review about these four TDDE models.
In Section III, we would like to constrain the models by using the SNe Ia, BAO, OHD data-sets as well as the single
data point from the newest event GW150914 [94].
In Section IV, we brieﬂy review the stateﬁnder hierarchy, the

growth rate of matter perturbations and the Om(z) diagnostic. In Section V, we discriminate the four models by
using the aforementioned three diagnostics. In the ﬁnal section, the concluding remarks are presented.

II. THE FOUR TIME-DEPENDENT DARK ENERGY MODELS

Parameterization has been applied to analyze various kinds of astronomical data-sets, which is proved to be an
very impactful and useful tool towards a more complete description of dark energy modelling. Generally speaking,
phenomenologically, one can explore some possible time-dependent parameterizations to describe the dark energy
equation of state parameter ω(z). Furthermore, by Taylor-expanding ω(z), one can obtain the following parameteri-
zations formalism

(cid:88)

ω(z) =

ωnxn(z),

(3)

n=0

where ωn denote the parameters to be determined by astrophysical observations and xn(z) the functions of the redshift
z. Obviously, one can get diﬀerent parameterized dark energy models by making some subtle choices of the functions
xn(z).

In this section, we will make a brief introduction about the four time-dependent dark energy models. In addition, it
is worth noting that we will neglect the radiation contribution at low redshifts and consider the ﬂat FRW background
spacetime throughout the context.

A. Model 1

The ﬁrst parameterization model was ﬁrstly proposed in [32] and can be expressed as

ω(z) = ω0 + ω1z,

(4)

where ω0 denotes the present-day value of the equation of state parameter, and ω1 a free parameter to be determined
by observations. This model was ﬁrstly constrained by Cooray et al.
[95] through adopting the SNe Ia data-set,
gravitational lensing statistics and global clusters ages. At the same time, Goliath et al. [34] also studied the limit
consequences of this model from the SNe Ia experiments. This parameterization is a good ﬁt for low redshifts , and
is exact for models where the equation of state changes slowly or is a constant. Nonetheless, this model exhibit
a problematic behavior for high redshifts, such as failing to explain the age estimations of high-z objects since it
just predicts substantially small ages at z (cid:62) 3. For conveniences of following constraints, the dimensionless Hubble
parameter including the dust matter and dark energy is given by

E(z) =

H(z)
H0

= [Ωm0(1 + z)3 + (1 − Ωm0)(1 + z)3(1+ω0−ω1)e3ω1z]1/2,

(5)

where the parameters ω0, ω1 and Ωm0 will be determined by the following astrophysical observations.

B. Model 2

The second parameterization model was introduced by Efstathiou [35], which is aimed at adjust some quintessence
models at z (cid:46) 4. The author discovered that, for a wide class of potentials related to the dynamical scalar ﬁeld models,
the evolutional behavior of ω(z) at z (cid:46) 4 can be well approximated by the following parameterization formalism

ω(z) = ω0 − ω2 ln(1 + z),

(6)

where ω2 denotes a free parameter to be determined by astronomical observations. Subsequently, the corresponding
dimensionless Hubble parameter can be expressed as

E(z) = [Ωm0(1 + z)3 + (1 − Ωm0)(1 + z)3(1+ω0)e− 3ω2[ln(1+z)]2

2

]1/2,

(7)

where the parameters ω0, ω2 and Ωm0 will be determined by the following astrophysical observations.

C. Model 3

4

The third parameterization scenario is the so-called CPL (Chevallier-Polarski-Linder) parameterization [36], which
is intended to solve the problematic behavior at high redshifts. Furthermore, this scenario is an excellent ﬁt for
a number of theoretically conceivable scalar ﬁeld potential, give a good explanation for small deviations from the
phantom barrier ω = −1 (see also [96]). At the same time, ω(z) is a well behaved function at z (cid:29) 1, and recovers the
linear behavior at low redshifts. Therefore, it is worth investigating this scenario further and it can be expressed in
the following manner

ω(z) = ω0 + ω3(

z

1 + z

),

(8)

where ω3 is also a free parameter to be determined by astrophysical observations. Subsequently, the corresponding
dimensionless Hubble parameter can be written as

E(z) = [Ωm0(1 + z)3 + (1 − Ωm0)(1 + z)3(1+ω0+ω3)e− 3ω3z

1+z ]1/2,

(9)

similarly, where the parameters ω0, ω3 and Ωm0 should be determined by the following astrophysical observations.

D. Model 4

The mentioned-above three parameterizations can not be reconstructed from the scalar ﬁeld dynamics since they
are not bounded functions, namely, the equation of state parameters are all divergent functions of the redshift z, which
lie in the range z ∈ [−1,∞). Since the dark energy phenomenon occurs being not far away from the present epoch, the
above three models can provide substantially good approximations and exhibit a quintom-like behavior to describe it,
when z is relatively ﬁnite. Even so, one can query the information of the aforementioned parameterizations has been
compromised so as to we can not identify. In this concern, Barboza et al. [39] proposed a new parameterization model
which is aimed at extending the range of applicability of the dark energy equation of state, and avoid the singularities
and uncertainties contained in three mentioned-above scenarios. In addition, one can obtain this new scenario from
the scalar ﬁeld dynamics. The last parameterization model could be expressed in the following manner:

ω(z) = ω0 + ω4

z(1 + z)
1 + z2 ,

(10)

where ω4 is a free parameter to be ensured by observations. Subsequently, the corresponding dimensionless Hubble
parameter can be expressed as

E(z) = [Ωm0(1 + z)3 + (1 − Ωm0)(1 + z)3(1+ω0)(1 + z2)

3ω4
2 ]1/2,

(11)

as before, where the parameters ω0, ω4 and Ωm0 will be ensured by the following astronomical observations.

III. OBSERVATIONAL CONSTRAINTS

A. Type Ia Supernovae Observations

In this situation, we adopt the Union 2.1 SNe Ia data-sets without systematic errors for ﬁtting, which covers the
redshift range z ∈ [0.015, 1.4]. The theoretical distance modulus for a supernovae at redshift z, given a set of model
parameters K, is

µt(z; K) = m − M = 5 lg dL + 25,

(12)

where m denotes the apparent magnitude, M the absolute magnitude and dL the luminosity distance in units of
megaparsecs,

dL(z; K) = (1 + z)

dz(cid:48)

E(z(cid:48); K)

,

(13)

(cid:90) z

where E(z; K) represents the dimensionless Hubble parameter for a concrete dark energy model, such as Eqs. (5),
(7), (9) and (11). Subsequently, we will calculate the best ﬁtting values for the model parameters K by performing
the so-called χ2 statistics, namely,

o(z) and σi denote the observed value and the corresponding 1σ error of the distance modulus, respectively,

B. Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations

As is well known, the spatial two-point correlation function of the density of baryons has a peak, namely, the
BAO peak, at a comoving scale rs which is proved to be about 150 Mpc. Since the baryons on these scales are
non-relativistic after short recombination, the location of the peak in the comoving frame would not change. Hence,
the location of the peak provides a general ruler, with a constant comoving scale at distinguishable redshifts during
almost the whole cosmic history. Furthermore, we adopt the BAO data-sets which can be found in [97], and use the
parameter A to measure the BAO peak in the distribution of the SDSS luminous red galaxies. Then, the parameter
A can be deﬁned as

The corresponding χ2 for the BAO measurements is

C. Observational Hubble Parameter

In our combined analysis we will use 29 determinations of the Hubble expansion parameter H(z) as a function of
the redshift z. These determinations are obtained by two basic methods, i.e., “ diﬀerential age method radial BAO
method ” and “ radial BAO method ”. More useful information can be found in [98, 99]. Comparing with the two
above observations, the H(z) data-sets can directly reﬂect the expansion rate of the universe and there is no need
to integrate over the redshift z so as to drop out some useful information when constraining a concrete model. To
perform the interesting test one can minimize the following quantity:

(17)

where Hobs(zi) is the observed value of the Hubble expansion rate at a given zi.

D. The Gravitational Wave

On September 14, 2015 at 09:50:45 UTC the two detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Obser-
vatory observed a transient gravitational wave signal from a black hole-black hole binary (BHBH) inspiral [94]. This
gravitational source lies at the luminosity distance of 410+160−180 Mpc corresponding to the redshift z = 0.09+0.03−0.04. In this
situation, we would like to use this single data point of the gravitational wave to constrain the TDDE models as well.
Although the quality of the data is not very good, we believe that the forthcoming gravitational-wave data-sets will
provide a new and powerful window for new physics. Conveniently, we add this data point into the SNe Ia data-sets
(580 data points) after calculating out the correspondingly observational distance modulus 38.0639+0.7155
−1.2553. In the
following context, for simplicity, we will denote the statistical contribution from the gravitational wave data as χ2
G.

Subsequently, in the ﬁrst place, we would compute the joint constraints from SNe Ia, BAO and OHD data-sets,

and the corresponding χ2

1 can be deﬁned as

χ2
1 = χ2

S + χ2

B + χ2

(18)

In the second place, we shall calculate the joint constraints from SNe Ia, BAO, OHD and the gravitational wave

data-sets. The corresponding χ2

2 can be deﬁned as

χ2

S + χ2

The minimum values of the derived χ2

BAO and OHD data-sets, are listed in Table. I. At the same time, The minimum values of the derived χ2
2 and the best
ﬁtting values of the model parameters constrained by SNe Ia, BAO, OHD as well as the gravitational wave data-sets,
are listed in Table. II.

respectively.

In Figure. 1, we just perform the likelihood distributions of the parameters (ω0, ωi) for the ﬁrst joint constraints χ2
1
from the SNe Ia, BAO and OHD data-sets, where ωi denotes ω1, ω2, ω3 and ω4, respectively. In the following content,
we still apply the best ﬁtting values of the model parameters from the ﬁrst joint constraints χ2
1 into distinguishing
the TDDE models and the ΛCDM model from each other.

IV. THE THREE DIAGNOSTICS

A. The stateﬁnder hierarchy

As mentioned above, the stateﬁnder hierarchy contains higher derivatives of the scale factor dna/dtn, n (cid:62) 2 so that
it may discriminate the dark energy models better. According to [92], the scale factor can be obtained in the following
manner by Taylor expansion:

a(t)
a0

= 1 +

where

n=1

[H0(t − t0)]n,

An =

aH n ,

(20)

(21)

where a(n) = dna/dtn. It is worth noting that a number of letters of the alphabet have been adopted to represent
diﬀerent derivatives of the scale factor a. To be more precise, historically, q = −A2 denotes the deceleration or

7

data-sets. The upper left panel, the upper right panel, the lower left panel and the lower right panel correspond to the likelihood
distributions of model 1, model 2, model 3 and model 4. The best ﬁtting value is shown as a dot for diﬀerent models.

acceleration parameter, A3 the stateﬁnder r or the jerk j [100], A4 the snap [100–103] and A5 the lerk [100–103].
Obviously, for the base cosmology in the spatially ﬂat FRW universe, one can easily obtain

where Ωm = Ωm0(1 + z)3/E2(z) and Ωm = 2(1 + q)/3 for the base cosmology. The stateﬁnder hierarchy Sn can be
deﬁned as

(29)

It is not diﬃcult to verify that, for the base cosmology, the stateﬁnder hierarchy Sn can be rewritten as[23]

Sn |ΛCDM = 1.

8

(30)

It is noteworthy that the above equations just deﬁne a good mull diagnostic for the base cosmology, since the equalities
will be violated by other dark energy models. Furthermore, when n (cid:62) 3, one can deﬁne a series of stateﬁnders as
follows:

S(1)
3 = S3,
S(1)
4 = A4 + 3(1 + q),
5 = A5 − 2(4 + 3q)(1 + q),
S(1)

....

(31)

(32)

(33)

The series of stateﬁnders have the same property with Sn, namely, remaining pegged at unity during the evolution of
the universe for the ΛCDM cosmology:

Therefore, one can obtain an interesting and important property, i.e., {Sn, S(1)
energy models will give diﬀerent values in terms of the pair {Sn, S(1)

For the ΛCDM scenario, obviously, {Sn, S(2)
one will get diﬀerent results so as to distinguish them from the ΛCDM scenario more conveniently. According to [104],
ωCDM, Chaplygin gas (CG), and DGP model have been discriminated from each other and the base cosmology.

n } = {1, 0}, {S(1)

B. The Growth Rate of Matter Perturbations

The growth rate of perturbations can be acted as an important and eﬀective supplement for the stateﬁnders, and

the fractional growth parameter (z) is deﬁned as

where

(z) =

f (z)

fΛCDM (z)

,

f (z) = Ωm(z)γ(z),

(36)

(37)

representing the growth rate of linearized density perturbations. For slowly varying equation of state with time, which
satisfy the condition |dω/dΩm| (cid:28) (1 − Ωm)−1, one can get the relationship

γ(z) =

3
5 − ω
1−ω

+

3
125

(1 − ω)(1 − 1.5ω)

(1 − 1.2ω)3

[1 − Ωm(z)] + O[(1 − Ωm(z))]2.

(38)

The above approximation works reasonably well for physical dark energy models with either a constant or a slowly
varying equation of state with time. However, it is not the case in modiﬁed gravities where the perturbation growth
contains information which is just complementary to that contained in the expansion history. For the ΛCDM scenario,
it is easy to ﬁnd that

(z) |ΛCDM = 1.

Thus, one can combine the stateﬁnders and the the growth rate of perturbations to deﬁne a composite

C. The Om(z) Diagnostic

The Om(z) diagnostic is also an useful method to discriminate various dark energy models, and can be deﬁned as

Om(x) =

E2(x) − 1
x3 − 1

,

(40)

where E(x) = H(x)/H0 and x = 1/a = 1 + z. Similarly, neglecting the radiation at low redshifts, for the base
cosmology, one can easily obtain

E2(x) = Ωm0x3 + (1 − Ωm0).

Substituting Eq. (41) into Eq. (40), one can get

Om(x) |ΛCDM = Ωm0.

(41)

(42)

It is not diﬃcult to ﬁnd that the Om(z) diagnostic also provides a null test for the base cosmology, and for other
evolving dark energy models, the Om(z) diagnostics are expected to give diﬀerent values. In our previous work [77],
the two parametrization models for eﬀective pressure have been well distinguished from each other and the ΛCDM
model.

evolutional tendency of the models 3 and 4 is very similar.

Before applying the the growth rate of matter perturbations to discriminate the four TDDE models, through some
numerical calculations, we discover that all the mentioned-above TDDE models satisfy the slowly varying condition at
the present stage. To be more precise, when z = 0, for model 1, we ﬁnd |dω/dΩm| = 0.34274 (cid:28) (1−Ωm)−1 ≈ 1.39957,
|dω/dΩm| = 0.24591 (cid:28) (1 − Ωm)−1 ≈ 1.40243 for model 2, |dω/dΩm| = 0.41763 (cid:28) (1 − Ωm)−1 ≈ 1.40125 for model
3, and |dω/dΩm| = 0.08595 (cid:28) (1 − Ωm)−1 ≈ 1.40128 for model 4. Moreover, one can easily ﬁnd that the values of
(1 − Ωm)−1 for these four models are very close to each other.
In Fig. 2, we have plotted the evolutional trajectories in the Ωm − ω plane for the four TDDE models and
the ΛCDM model. Obviously, for models 1, 2 and 4, there exists a high degeneracy in the substantially long period
(0.2 (cid:46) Ωm (cid:46) 0.9) and vary very slowly at the present epoch. For model 3, one can ﬁnd that the trajectory corresponds
to a monotonically decreasing function ω(Ωm), and vary more slowly at the present stage than in the remote past.

In Figure. 3, we have plotted the evolutional behavior of the fractional growth parameter (z) for the aforementioned
TDDE scenarios and the ΛCDM scenario. It is easy to be seen that these four TDDE models just run closely to the
ΛCDM model in the remote past, and deviate obviously from the base cosmology when z < 1.5. Furthermore, one
can ﬁnd that these models obey a high degeneracy so as to be hardly distinguished at the present epoch.

with time, and also model 2 can be discriminated better from the base cosmology than the other models at the present

the function formalism f (z) for the four TDDE parameterization models very much. From Figure. 6, one can discover
that the parameterizations for the equation of state of models 3 and 4 are very similar in the substantially long period,
which can provide an excellent and reasonable explanation for the similar evolution tendency of the two models in
the planes of {S(1)

models 1, 3 and 4 will go through the ﬁxed point {1, 0} which corresponds to the ΛCDM scenario more than one time.
Subsequently, we plot the evolutional trajectories of these models in the planes of {Ωm, S(1)

and {Ωm, S(2)

trajectories of these TDDE models in these ﬁgures go through the horizontal line which corresponds to the ΛCDM
scenario more than one time. Furthermore, by plotting the vertical band centered at Ωm0 = 0.3 which corresponds
roughly to the present stage, one can ﬁnd that these models may not be well distinguished from each other and the

ΛCDM scenario. For instance, in Figure. 8, models 2 and 3 can not be well discriminated at the present epoch
since the two evolutional trajectories share one overlap, and in Figure. 9, one can also observe two overlaps, which
means models 3 and 4 can not be distinguished at the present stage, so do models 1 and 3. In Figure. 10, one still
distinguish models 2 and 3 as in Figure. 8 at the present stage. In Figure. 11, model 3 remains not discriminated
from models 1 and 4 at the present epoch, but can be well distinguished form the ΛCDM scenario. Then, we think
that it is constructive to exhibit the evolutional behavior of the stateﬁnder hierarchy. As a concrete example, we plot
the evolutional trajectory of the TDDE models in the {z, S(1)

From Figure. 13, it is easy to be seen that model 2 can be well distinguished from the left three models and the
ΛCDM model at the present epoch, and model 4 may not be well distinguished from the ΛCDM model. Moreover,
models 3 and 4 will approach the ΛCDM scenario in the far future. From Figure. 14, one will discover that all the
TDDE models can be distinguished at the present stage better than in Figure. 13, and models 1 and 3 will be the
same with the base cosmology, respectively, at two diﬀerent epochs during the evolution of the universe.

model 1 and model 4 will be invariable in the far future. In Figure. 17, it is obvious that all the models are hardly
distinguished from the ΛCDM scenario and one from other at the present epoch. Moreover, the evolutional trajectory
of model 2 is completely diﬀerent from other models in the far future. As for Figure. 18, we ﬁnd that all the TDDE
models can be well discriminated from the ΛCDM model at the present epoch, but models 3 and 4 may not be well
distinguished from each other at the present stage. Additionally, one could ﬁnd that there exists an apparent break
point for model 2 during the evolution of the universe, and the distance in terms of S(2)

In Figure. 19, we adopt the Om(z) diagnostic to distinguish the TDDE models from the ΛCDM model, and one

and ΛCDM model at the present epoch in terms of 68.3% conﬁdence level.

VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS

Since cosmologists have proposed various kinds of dark energy models to explain the accelerated mechanism of the
recent universe expansion, it is worth investigating the relationship among diﬀerent cosmological models. Sahni et al.
[91] have constructed a series of diagnostics to distinguish diﬀerent dark energy models from each other and the base
cosmology scenario, including the original stateﬁnder, stateﬁnder hierarchy, CND, Om(z) and Om3(z) diagnostics.

In this paper, ﬁrst of all, we place constraints on the four (TDDE) models by using the SNe Ia, BAO, OHD
data-sets as well as the single data point from the newest event GW150914. Subsequently, we have adopted the
former four diagnostics to discriminate four TDDE models from each other and the base cosmology scenario. As
mentioned above, we have plotted the evolutional trajectories of these models in the planes of {S(1)
4 }, {S4, S(2)

{S(1)
discover that these four TDDE models and the ΛCDM model can be well distinguished from each other at the present
epoch in the planes of {S(1)
4 }, {S(2)
5 } and {S(2)
5 }. Since models 3 and 4 share a similar
4 } and {S(1)
evolution tendency in the planes of {S(1)
5 }, we have plotted the function formalism
f (z) of the two parameterizations and discover that the parameterizations for the equation of state of models 3 and
4 are very similar in the substantially long period, which can also provide an excellent and reasonable explanation
for the similar evolution tendency of the two models. Furthermore, to understand the phenomenon that models
1, 3 and 4 go through the ﬁxed point {1, 0} which corresponds to the ΛCDM scenario more than one time in the
5 } plane better, we also plot the evolutional trajectories of the TDDE models and the ΛCDM
stateﬁnder {S(1)
scenario in the planes of {S(1)
4 , z}. It is not diﬃcult to be seen
that in the aforementioned ﬁgures, the evolutional trajectories of these TDDE models go through the horizontal line
which corresponds to the ΛCDM scenario more than one time. Subsequently, using the CND {S(1)

all the TDDE models evolve starting from the ΛCDM model and gradually deviate from each other, and model 2 can

that model 3 may not be well distinguished from the ΛCDM scenario at the present epoch. More attractively, the

{S(2)

are hardly distinguished from the ΛCDM scenario and one from the other at the present epoch, and the evolutional
trajectory of model 2 is completely diﬀerent from other models in the far future. As a supplement, using the Om(z)
diagnostic, we discover that the TDDE models can be hardly distinguished from each other at the present epoch. To
be more precise, one can not distinguish the TDDE models and ΛCDM model from each other at the present epoch
in terms of 68.3% conﬁdence interval.

Obviously, the outcomes obtained by adopting the stateﬁnder hierarchy can distinguish the TDDE models and
ΛCDM model from each other better than that obtained by adopting the CND. In particular, we discover that it is
not the case, namely, the higher order statedinders we adopt, the better one can distinguish various kinds of dark
energy models from each other.

18

In particular, it must be highlighted that the gravitational wave is an elegant and powerful window for new physics.
We would like to make the best use of it to constrain various kinds of modiﬁed gravity models and dynamical dark
energy models.

Our forthcoming work could be to construct new diagnostics which can be also regarded as more eﬀective tool to
distinguish various dark energy scenarios from each other. In addition, it is substantially constructive to use the more
accurate observations to constrain the TDDE models and other cosmological models in the future.
