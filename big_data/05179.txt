ABSTRACT

Aims. Dust grains with sizes around (sub)mm are expected to couple only weakly to the gas motion in regions beyond 10 au of
circumstellar disks. In this work, we investigate the inﬂuence of the spatial distribution of such grains on the (sub)mm appearance of
magnetized protoplanetary disks.
Methods. We perform non-ideal global 3D magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) stratiﬁed disk simulations including particles of different
sizes (50 µm to 1 cm), using a Lagrangian particle solver. Subsequently, we calculate the spatial dust temperature distribution, includ-
ing the dynamically coupled submicron-sized dust grains, and derive ideal continuum re-emission maps of the disk through radiative
transfer simulations. Finally, we investigate the feasibility to observe speciﬁc structures in the thermal re-emission maps with the
Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA).
Results. Depending on the level of the turbulence, the radial pressure gradient of the gas and the grain size, particles settle to the
midplane and/or drift radially inward. The pressure bump close to the outer edge of the dead-zone leads to particle trapping in ring
structures. More speciﬁcally, vortices in the disk concentrate the dust and create an inhomogeneous distribution of the solid material in
the azimuthal direction. The large-scale disk perturbations are preserved in the (sub)mm re-emission maps. The observable structures
are very similar to those expected to result from planet-disk interaction. Additionally, the larger dust particles increase the brightness
contrast between gap and ring structures. We ﬁnd that rings, gaps and the dust accumulation in the vortex could be traced with ALMA
down to a scale of a few astronomical units in circumstellar disks located in nearby star-forming regions. Finally, we present a brief
comparison of these structures with those recently found with ALMA in the young circumstellar disks of HL Tau and Oph IRS 48.

1. Introduction
Recent observations of protoplanetary disks have revealed the
existence of a wealth of structures with various properties, from
dust asymmetries and concentrations in the outer regions of pro-
toplanetary disks (e.g., Oph IRS 48: van der Marel et al. 2013,
LkHα 330: Isella et al. 2013, SAO 206462 and SR 21: Pérez
et al. 2014, or in HD 142527: Casassus et al. 2013; Fukagawa
et al. 2013) to the amazing image of HL Tau (ESO press re-
lease 1436 and Partnership et al. 2015) obtained during ALMA
science veriﬁcation phase using its most extended conﬁguration
and revealing without ambiguity a multiple dust ring structure.
These exciting observations have often been interpreted as the
signature of the presence of a young planet in the disk. This is
because the dust spatial distribution is believed to trace the un-
derlying gaseous structure of the disk.

Indeed, while small dust grains of submicron size are well
coupled to the motion of the gas in circumstellar disks, this is
not the same for particles of (sub)mm size that form from colli-
sional growth due to various underlying physical processes (e.g.,
Testi et al. 2014). For these larger particles, the coupling be-

tween the grains and the gas reduces (Beckwith et al. 2000) and
large–scale gas structures, like radial pressure gradients or vor-
tices are able to locally concentrate these partially decoupled
particles (Barge & Sommeria 1995; Tanga et al. 1996; Klahr
& Henning 1997; Chavanis 2000; Johansen et al. 2004; Lyra
et al. 2009a; Regály et al. 2012; Meheut et al. 2012; Pinilla
et al. 2012; Birnstiel et al. 2013; Lyra & Lin 2013; Zhu & Stone
2014). Various mechanisms creating such large-scale structures
have been proposed, such as variations in the accretion stress
at the gas ionization boundaries (Varnière & Tagger 2006; Lyra
et al. 2009b; Dzyurkevich et al. 2010; Faure et al. 2015; Lyra
et al. 2015; Flock et al. 2015), sublimation zones (Kretke & Lin
2007; Brauer et al. 2008; Dzyurkevich et al. 2013; Zhang et al.
2015), sintering zones (Okuzumi et al. 2015), planet-disk inter-
actions (Paardekooper & Mellema 2004; Zhu et al. 2014), photo-
evaporation (Espaillat et al. 2012) or gravitational disk instabil-
ities (Bertin & Lodato 2001; Vorobyov & Basu 2005). Further
investigation conﬁrmed their observability, e.g. for planet-disk
interactions (Wolf & D’Angelo 2005, Gonzalez et al. 2012, Ruge
et al. 2013), self gravitating disks (Cossins et al. 2010, Dipierro

The dust particles with perfect coupling to the gas motion have
sizes of amin = 0.005 µm ≤ a ≤ 0.25 µm = amax and they are
called small dust particles in the present work. The grains are
homogeneous, compact and spherical, and follow the size distri-
bution

∝ a−3.5.

In addition to the distribution of the small dust, we con-
sider spherical particles with the following radii: 50 µm, 90 µm,
0.2 mm, 0.3 mm, 0.5 mm, 0.9 mm, 1.7 mm, 3.1 mm, 5.5 mm, and
10 mm. We refer to them as large dust particles. We consider the
external forces of gas drag and gravity. To calculate the grain
trajectories, we solve the equation of motion in the spherical co-
ordinates system (r,ϑ,φ):

the gas and the particles. In this work, we focus on the Epstein
regime, which is valid when the particle size a is smaller than
9/4 of the mean free path of the gas molecules (Weidenschilling
1977). In this case, the coupling time τt can be expressed as:

τt =

with the solid density ρd = 2.7 g.cm−3, the gas density ρg and the
sound speed cs. The Stokes number St = τt · Ω of the large dust
particles is shown in Fig. 1. Initially, we place 50,000 particles
in each size bin, randomly distributed in the simulation domain.
The initial velocity of the particles is set to match the local Ke-
plerian velocity. In Appendix B.3 we show, that the effect of the
number of particles and a different distribution of the particles
onto the results remains small.

Two snapshots of the simulation will be considered in the
following: one after 150 inner orbits of the disk, corresponding
to 18,900 years of disk evolution, and one after 600 inner orbits,
corresponding to 75,600 years. After 150 orbits of the inner disk,
the (sub)mm dust particles have accumulated into ring structures
(see Fig. 2, left) due to a pressure jump at the outer dead-zone
edge (see Fig. 3). In Fig. 3, we project the distribution of the
larger particles in the 2D R-Z/R plane. We remind that the larger
particles are located along an azimuthal ring, while they slowly
oscillate in the vertical direction. Another time snapshot could
show a different distribution for z > 0 and z < 0. During the fol-
lowing hundreds of orbits, the Rossby wave instability generates
a vortex that concentrates dust particles depending on their size.
We plot the grains spatial distribution that results at 600 orbits
on the right panel of Fig. 2. In agreement with the ﬁndings of
Meheut et al. (2012), we observe an increased concentration of
larger particles towards the vortex center. We note that we can
only observe the increase of the dust to gas mass ratio and not its
saturated value as we do not consider the dust back-reaction onto

et al. 2014, Pohl et al. (2015), Takahashi et al. (2016)) or vor-
tices (Wolf & Klahr 2002; Pinilla et al. 2012). As we can see,
the presence of a planet in the disk as the origin of the recently
observed structure is only one possibility among others and must
be examined critically. In addition, those disk systems are evolv-
ing on timescales of several millions of years with ongoing dust
growth and reprocessing (Williams & Cieza 2011; Wolf et al.
2012) but the exact age of the observed system is difﬁcult to es-
timate.

In this context, we have shown in Flock et al. (2015) that it
is possible to explain pronounced dust rings and local concentra-
tions in magnetized disks without a planet. At the outer edge of
the dead-zone, the response of the magneto-rotational instability
(MRI) to variations of the gas density supports the formation of a
large-scale gap and jump structure in the gas density distribution.
The surface density maximum triggers the Rossby wave instabil-
ity (Lovelace et al. 1999; Lesur & Papaloizou 2009; Lin & Pa-
paloizou 2010; Lin 2012a,b), which is a special form of Kelvin
Helmholtz instability (Papaloizou & Pringle 1984), resulting in
the formation of a vortex. In the present study, we further in-
vestigate the spatial and temporal distribution of large dust par-
ticles (radii ranging from 50 µm to 1 cm) in such a disk model.
We focus on the impact of these dust grains on the (sub)mm
appearance of the circumstellar disk. For this purpose, we calcu-
late the motion of each particle individually using a Lagrangian
method and simulate the thermal re-emission maps based on the
resulting dust density distribution with the continuum radiative
transfer code MC3D (Wolf et al. 1999; Wolf 2003). The results
are compared with our previous model that include only small
dust grains (Flock et al. 2015). Therefore, we make use of the
same disk setup, which is characterized by a total disk mass of
0.042 M(cid:12), a disk radius ranging from 20 au to 100 au, a dead-
zone from 20 au to 40 au , a central star with an effective temper-
ature of 4000 K, a luminosity of 0.95 L(cid:12) , and a stellar mass of
0.5 M(cid:12).

2. Modeling techniques
We use non-ideal global 3D MHD stratiﬁed simulations of a cir-
cumstellar disk model as described in our previous work (see
model D2G_e-2 in Section 2 and Fig. 7 in Flock et al. 2015).

(corresponding to 18,900 years of evolution). Right: Time step after 600 inner orbits (75,600 years). The particle size is given in units of mm.
After 150 inner orbits (18,900 years), the particles are concentrated into rings. After 600 inner orbits (75,600 years), the vortex has broken the ring
structures and has concentrated the larger particles.

in the computational domain should thus be seen as a lower limit.
During the full simulation run, we observe an increase of the
dust to gas mass ratio by 20% when averaging over a disk scale
height. However, we note that on scales smaller than a tenths of
a disk scale height the increase of the dust component can be
larger. Only future very high resolution dust and gas simulation
including the back-reaction of the dust on the gas and a consis-
tent resupply of particles can investigate the effect of the solid
component on the gas.

Inside the dead-zone (for r < 40 au), all large particles re-
main at the midplane (see Fig. 3). Outside of the dead-zone, the
50 µm particles are still efﬁciently mixed in the vertical direc-
tion up to about one gas scale height. In Fig. 3, we overplot the
surface density of the gas at the two selected timesteps. The gas
surface density of the gap and jump is decreasing between the
two timesteps outward of 40 au (see Fig. 3). Such a decrease in
gas density leads to reduced coupling between the particles to
the gas, thereby favoring the maintenance of the ring on long
timescales. The dynamical process is conducive to the formation
of a dust ring by the evolution of the gas density and the sub-
sequent decoupling of the dust was recently demonstrated in a
study by Meru et al. (2014).

Fig. 4 shows in addition to the gas surface density the total
dust surface density and the surface density for the reference dust
components shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. The plot shows that the
dust surface density is mainly determined by the larger particles
which show efﬁcient concentration at the pressure maximum.
We also note that the density gap at 20 au is clearly induced
by the outﬂow boundary as the surface density is truncated in
a region between 20-25 au which causes a local pressure max-
imum and so the evolution of a vortex there. The actual inner
dead-zone edge should be much closer inward.

grains at wavelengths > 100 µm1. In scattered light at a wave-
length of 2.2 µm (K band) the appearance of the disk is not in-
ﬂuenced by the large dust particles at all, because they are all
conﬁned to less than one scale height (see Section 2 and Fig. 3)
and this part of the disk is not traced by scattered light at this
wavelength (Ruge et al. 2013).
The large dust grains are not homogeneously distributed in the
disk. Their distribution is also time dependent (see Section 2
and Fig. 2). As a result, they are able to change the (sub)mm ap-
pearance of a circumstellar disk signiﬁcantly within a few 104
years (one inner orbit ≈ 126 years), even though they only con-
tribute a fraction ≈ 0.07% of the total mass of the disk (compare
left and right column of Fig. 5). This is in contrast with the re-
sults in Section 4.2 of Flock et al. (2015), where the re-emission
structure of the disk – with small grains only – remains constant
over the same period

The thermal emission maps in Fig. 5 show three dominating
structures, which are due to the distribution of the (large) dust in
the disk (see Fig. 2). At both time steps, the gap, which was dis-
cussed already by Flock et al. (2015) is present in the re-emission
maps. After 150 inner orbits (18,900 years) the large dust parti-
cles have accumulated into rings. In the thermal emission maps
this leads to an enlarged brightness contrast ratio between the in-
nermost region of the gap and its edges. In comparison to the re-
sults obtained without the larger dust grains the contrast is ≈ 1.5
times higher (see Fig. 6). The gap appears deeper in this case.
Similar results have been found for the local concentrations of
larger, weakly coupled dust grains in the case of planet-disk in-
teraction by Paardekooper & Mellema (2004); Rice et al. (2006);
Fouchet et al. (2007); Lyra et al. (2009c); Fouchet et al. (2010);
Ayliffe et al. (2012); Zhu et al. (2012).

After 600 inner orbits (75,600 years) the disk shows a large
vortex, which becomes visible due to the concentration of larger
particles (see Fig. 2). With the exception of the 50 µm particles,
the vortex has destroyed the dust ring structures and concen-
trated the larger dust particles azimuthally. This size-dependent
dynamics of the dust grains lead to different thermal emission
maps at different wavelengths (see Fig. 5, right). Observations
at longer wavelengths (≥ 1.3 mm) trace the dust concentration
in the vortex very well, while the radiation of the smallest parti-
cles in our setup dominates at shorter wavelengths and is more
smoothly distributed (see Fig. 5, right). A similar trend was seen
in a recent observations of HL Tau at 7 mm (Carrasco-Gonzalez
et al. 2016), which shows clear azimuthal variations inside the
ring at 7 mm compared to the smooth emission at 1.3 mm. Even-
tually, this offers the possibility to determine the size of the parti-
cles in the vortex by using spatially resolved maps of the spectral
index (see Section 4).

As already mentioned in Section 2, the set of large dust parti-
cles samples a continuous grain size distribution. Consequently,
the distribution of dust grains of a certain size, that is not in-
cluded in our setup, can be approximated by interpolating from
the upper and lower size bins. We have checked that a higher
sampling of the dust size bins has no effect onto the disk struc-
tures.

We note again that the vortex lifetime is around 40 local or-
bits until it is destroyed and reformed again on a timescale of 20
local orbits (Flock et al. 2015). We do not observe any migration
of the vortex. We point out that we consider Ohmic resistivity

1 We note that the factor of 1.5 should be understood as a lower limit
as we do not resupply the grains in the outer domain. Especially the
particles (radii ≥ 3.1 mm) drift quickly radially inward and leave the
simulation.

dust (dotted line) and the 4 representative dust components, 1.71 mm

step after 150 inner orbits (18,900 years) (top) and 600 inner orbits (bot-
tom).

Radiative transfer (RT): To calculate the temperature distri-
bution and thermal re-emission maps of the disks, we use the
RT code MC3D (Wolf et al. 1999; Wolf 2003). We focus on
the continuum emission of the dust phase of the disk assuming
that the dust material is composed of 62.5 % silicate and 37.5 %
graphite (optical data by Weingartner & Draine 2001). We cal-
culate the wavelength-dependent absorption efﬁciencies for the
different grain sizes with Mie theory, using the tool MieX (Wolf
& Voshchinnikov 2004).

In this study the dust phase consists of two components. The
ﬁrst component is the system of small dust particles that fully
couple to the motion of the gas in the disk (see Section 2). The
distribution of these particles follows the gas distribution. The
second component of the dust phase is represented by large dust
particles (see Section 2). As for the small particles, the large par-
ticles initially follow the continuous power law size distribution
given by Eq. (1). Each grain of size ag in the simulation repre-
sents a number of dust particles ˜Ng(ag). Appendix A presents a
detailed description of the calculation of ˜Ng(ag).

3. Results and Discussion
Our goal is to explore the impact of the large dust particles on
the thermal re-emission of circumstellar disks. Our analysis is
based on the simulated 441 µm, 871 µm, 1.3 mm and 2.0 mm re-
emission maps of our disks (assuming they are located at a dis-
tance of 140 pc from the observer) at the two selected time steps.
In particular, we compare these maps to our previous models
with the small dust grains (Flock et al. 2015).
The additional large dust grains increase the total ﬂux of the
thermal disk re-emission at 1.3 mm by a factor of ≈ 1.5. This is
due to the absorption efﬁciency of the large grains that is several
orders of magnitude higher in comparison to that of the small

inner orbits (18,900 years) with (solid blue line) and without additional
large dust particles (dashed red line) at a wavelength of 1.3 mm. The
contrast ratio between the brightness minimum, which corresponds to
the gap center, and the brightness maximum of the disk for radii > 55 au
is enlarged by a factor of ≈ 1.5 through the additional large dust parti-
cles in comparison to the case with small grains only. The total number
of grains particles Nmax is the same for both the blue and the red curve
(see Appendix A), which means that the number of small grains used to
compute the red curve is reduced in comparison to the blue lined case.
This leads to a decreased ﬂux at the gap center.

our disk model would look like. We select the position of HL
Tau (RA: 4 h31min38.4s, DEC: +18◦13(cid:48)57.4(cid:48)(cid:48) J2000, distance:
140 pc; Kwon et al. 2011) and its inclination of 40◦ (Kwon et al.
2011). The thermal emission maps are re-calculated under the
assumption of the stellar luminosity (L(cid:63) ≈ 8.3 L(cid:12)) and an ef-
fective temperature (4000 K) of HL Tau (Kwon et al. 2011).
We focus on the wavelengths of 871 µm and 1.3 mm, and select
very extended conﬁgurations of the ALMA array with maximum
baselines of ∼ 8 km and ∼ 15 km. The observing time is cho-
sen to be 6 h. The resulting spatial resolution is 49 mas × 39 mas
at 871 µm and 37 mas × 32 mas at 1.3 mm. Thermal and phase
noise are added (see the details on our ALMA setup in Flock
et al. (2015). We emphasize that the goal of these simulations is
to study qualitatively the extent to which the ring structure found
in our simulations resembles the structure found in the HL Tau
disk, while a quantitative ﬁt to the observational results of HL
Tau which would require a detailed consideration of the enve-
lope which has been investigated in RT models by Men’shchikov
et al. (1999).

ALMA enables the detection of single dust rings with this
conﬁguration for an observing wavelength of 1.3 mm (see Fig
7, top right). At a wavelength of 871 µm the dust ring structure
is less pronounced (see Fig 7, top left). This is due to the emis-
sion of the smaller grains that are distributed homogeneously in
the disk and still efﬁcient at this wavelength (Fig. 5). These dif-
ferences offer a possibility to identify dust concentrations as the
origin of the ring structures. From the wavelength-dependence of
the emission, one can constrain the size of the re-emitting parti-
cles. For this purpose, we calculate the spatially resolved map of
the spectral index from both simulated ALMA observations (see
Fig 7, bottom left) and the proﬁle of the spectral index in a se-
lected cut through the map (see Fig 7, bottom right). The spectral
index is deﬁned as:
αSp = − ∂ log10 (Fλ)
∂ log10 (λ) .

(6)

At the position of the dust rings the spectral index is reduced,
which indicates the presence of larger particles. Within the gap
in the disk, the spectral index is increased which indicates that
only smaller dust grains are present in this region. We note that

as the sole source of magnetic ﬁeld dissipation and neglect for
simplicity the Hall effect and ambipolar diffusion. Recent results
have shown their importance for MRI–driven turbulence in cir-
cumstellar disks (Bai & Stone 2013; Lesur et al. 2014; Béthune
et al. 2016). They could potentially shift the MRI inactive zone
radially outward or even trigger new instabilities. In addition, in
this region the electron heating could become important, which
was recently shown by Mori & Okuzumi (2015).

4. Comparison to recent ALMA observations
Dust ring structures: The ring structures found in the den-
sity distribution of the disk after 150 inner orbits (18,900 years)
appear qualitatively similar to the structures recently observed
in the disk of HL Tau (Partnership et al. 2015). Therefore, we
explore how an equivalent (simulated) ALMA observation of

Fig. 7. Top: Simulated ALMA images of the disk after 150 inner orbits (18,900 years) at a wavelength of 871 µm (left) and 1.3 µm (right). The
position, the disk inclination, distance and stellar luminosity of HL Tau were used for these simulation. At both wavelengths a gap is visible. The
gap in the images are emphasized and we note that its origin lies in the magnetic ﬁeld in the disk and not a planet. Bottom left: Spatially resolved

the asymmetric feature, seen in the spectral index map could
arise from the projection as the disk is inclined along that direc-
tion. Finally, we conclude that similar (sub)mm appearances of
circumstellar disks can result from an inhomogeneous grain size
distribution in the radial direction as discussed above without the
necessity to invoke the presence of a planet as is usually done.
We emphasize that the position of the gap and ring structure is
located at the dead-zone outer edge, which depends mainly on
the surface density amount and proﬁle of gas and dust (Dzyurke-
vich et al. 2013; Flock et al. 2015). For the parameters used here
we expect this to happen at any location where the total surface
density becomes around 15 g cm−2, assuming a dust to gas mass
ratio of 0.01, as this value marks the threshold for MRI activity.
We note again that the ring state, presented in Fig. 7, is present
more often than only once in the simulation. As we have pointed
out, the lifetime of the vortex is around 40 local orbits. After this
time, the particles will be again only radially concentrated. It is
true that each individual ring state will look different, especially
if we do not resupply the particles inside the domain. The vortex

state is still more likely to observe (2/3 vortex state vs. 1/3 ring
state).

Dust concentrations in vortices: Due to the concentration of
large dust particles in the vortex, the re-emission maps of the
disk after 600 inner orbits (75,600 years) appear similar to vari-
ous recent ALMA observations of young circumstellar disks (see
section 1). In order to investigate this similarity, we explore how
a simulated ALMA observation of this disk model will look like.
We select the position, distance and object inclination of Oph
IRS 48 (RA: 16 h27min37.8s, DEC: −24◦30(cid:48)35.3(cid:48)(cid:48) J2000, dis-
tance: 120 pc, inclination: 50◦; van der Marel et al. 2013). Other
model parameters such as stellar temperature and luminosity or
disk mass are not adapted to the parameters of Oph IRS 48. Our
goal is to show the feasibility to observe the vortex in the disk. In
comparison to the thermal emission maps in the right column of
Fig. 5, we rotate the model counterclockwise by 90◦. We select
a wavelength of 1.3 mm, an observing time of 5 h, and a conﬁg-

wavelength of 1.3 mm in comparison to the results of Flock
et al. (2015).

– Depending on the wavelength, the gap, dust rings and dust

concentration in vortices can be observed with ALMA.

– The spatial distribution of dust grains of different size can
also be identiﬁed by a decreased spectral index in spatially
resolved spectral index maps calculated on the basis of sim-
ulated ALMA observation.

– The ring structures as well as the dust concentration in the
vortex are stable for at least 104 years. In addition, the disk is
alternating between a state with and without azimuthal dust
concentration by a vortex, as already shown by Flock et al.
(2015), signiﬁcantly increasing the likelihood to observe the
presented structures. The vortex state is more likely to ob-
serve (by 66%) compared to the ring state.

We conclude that inhomogeneous and non-axisymmetric distri-
butions of larger dust grains have a major impact on the (sub)mm
appearance of a circumstellar disk. Our work shows that such in-
homogeneities can naturally arise as a result of internal dynami-
cal processes associated with the presence of a weak magnetic
ﬁeld, without having to rely on a planet orbiting in the disk.
More constraints will be required in the future to disentangle
the origin of the observed (sub)mm structures in protoplanetary
disks, including observations of the magnetic ﬁeld (e.g., HL Tau
Stephens et al. 2014) and/or of the disk kinematics (Simon et al.
2015).

corresponding to a spatial resolution of 0.13 (cid:48)(cid:48) × 0.11 (cid:48)(cid:48).
The concentration of large dust particles in the vortex in-
creases the ﬂux at the vortex position by a factor ≈ 2.8 in the
simulated ALMA observation compared to the models without
large dust grains. The peak ﬂux at the vortex compared to the
background is around 10, which is lower then the value 130
found by (Zhu & Stone 2014). However we note that several
factors inﬂuences this peak emission, especially the dust con-
centration and size of the vortex. E.g. the planet induced vortex
by (Zhu & Stone 2014) appears to be larger in size. Finally, we
show the feasibility to detect a vortex through its ability to con-
centrate large dust grains in a circumstellar disk again, without
the necessity of a planetary mass perturber.

5. Conclusion
In this work, we have followed the motion and concentration of
large dust particles with different sizes in a typical protoplane-
tary disk using a non-ideal 3D MHD disk simulation. We have
performed RT calculations to derive the temperature proﬁle and
thermal emission maps of the disk. Our goal was to investigate
the impact of (sub)mm-sized dust grains on spatially resolved
thermal emission maps of circumstellar disks and the feasibility
to detect selected structures with ALMA. In summary, we ﬁnd:
– The larger dust particles (with radii ranging from 50 µm to
1 cm) are weakly coupled to the gas motion and accumulate
in rings.

– Vortices in the disk can break up those rings and concentrate
the dust particles azimuthally. This leads to an increased lo-
cal dust-to-gas ratio in the vortex center.

– Due to the high efﬁciency of emission of these large dust
grains, the dust rings as well as the dust concentration in
vortices are emphasized in the thermal emission maps of the
disk. For example, the higher concentration of the larger dust
grains enlarges the brightness contrast between the minimum
in the gap and the peak outside by at least a factor of 1.5 at a

Appendix A: Calculating ˜Ng
In the case of the large dust grains, each of the initial ’test’ parti-
cles of a certain radius ag represents a certain number of dust par-
ticles ˜Ng(ag). We assume, that the initial dust mass Md amounts
to 1% of the total gas mass Mgas and is the sum of the mass of
the small dust Msd and the mass of the larger dust Mld. In the ra-
diative transfer calculation, the dust properties of the small dust
are discretized into 1000 bin sizes, therefore the mass Msd can
be expressed in the following way:

Msd =

i · N(ai),

(A.1)

where ρmd = 2.7 g.cm−3 is the density of the dust material and
N(ai) is the absolute number of particles with radius ai. Follow-
ing the grain size distribution (see Eq. 1), N(ai) can be written

In this section, we performed global hydrodynamical simula-

We average the particle velocity between 2 and 8 local orbits.
Fig. B.2 shows the particle velocity, overplotted with Eq. B.4.
The velocities match very well the prediction of Eq. B.4.

Appendix B.3: Benchmark: The radiative transfer
Following the MHD simulation presented in Appendix 2, we
performed an additional global simulation with 5 · 106 particles.
For the setup, we use the identical same initial conditions for the
MHD setup as the previous model. To distribute the larger par-
ticles we use a 1/R proﬁle instead of a uniform distribution. We
use the concept, which has been already deﬁned in Section A,
to incorporate these particles into the radiative transfer simula-
tion. All further parameters remain constant. The gas evolution
and so the distribution of the small particles is the same as as
in the previous models. The larger particles quickly redistribute
and are concentrated at the same position. We perform the radi-
ation transfer calculation at the same time output after 150 inner
orbits.
The results of both radiative transfer calculations at a wavelength
of 1.3 mm are presented in Fig. B.3. Both simulations show a
very similar emission map with differences in the order of sev-
eral percent, see Fig. B.3 bottom. From that we conclude, that the
inﬂuence of the number of large particles and the initial distribu-
tion remains small. This comparison strengthens our conclusion
as the structures resulting from the positions of the larger dust
particles (see section 3) are robust.

with the cylindrical radius R = r sin(θ), the spherical radius r, the
orbital frequency ΩK, the sound speed cs = H · Ω and the scale

model with a radial extent of 20 − 40 au, ∆θ = 0.72 radian and
R0
∆φ = 0.4 radian. The resolution is set to (96x96x48) in (r, θ, φ)
and H0 = 0.1 at R0 = 40 au. In the following two testruns, we
check the vertical and radial integration and drag regimes indi-
vidually.

Appendix B.1: Vertical motion
The ﬁrst disk model uses the parameter set of p = q = 0 so that
the radial pressure gradient vanishes. In this case, the particles
do not drift and we can focus on the vertical motion. In this test,
we inject a large particle (Stokes number of 300) at two scale
heights, located at 30 au. The vertical motion of large particles
can be described by a damped oscillation, with oscillation fre-
quency ω = ΩK and the amplitude damping z(t)
z(t) = z0 · e−t/(2τt),
with the the stopping time τt. Fig. B.1 shows the particle evo-
lution over height. The particle oscillates with orbital rotation
frequency and its motion ﬁts very well a damped oscillation.

Appendix B.2: Radial motion
In the second test we inject particles of different sizes at the mid-
plane at R = 35au to study the radial drift. For this setup we use
p = −1.0 and q = −0.5. We set the particles initial velocity to
Keplerian. The particle drift is plotted in Fig. B.2. The particles
with Stokes number St = 1 drift radially inwards. The maxi-
mum drift velocity vmax is proportional to the velocity difference
vK − vφ and is in our case around 33 meters per second. The drift
