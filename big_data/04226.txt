ABSTRACT

We derive a new relation between cosological distances, valid in any (statistically) isotropic space-time and independent of cosmolog-
ical parameters or even the validity of the ﬁeld equation of General Relativity. In particular, this relation yields an equation between
those distance ratios which are the geometrical factors determining the strength of the gravitational lensing eﬀect of mass concentra-
tions. Considering a combination of weak lensing shear ratios, based on lenses at two diﬀerent redshifts, and sources at three diﬀerent
redshifts, we derive a relation between shear-ratio tests which must be identically satisﬁed. A redshift-dependent multiplicative bias
in shear estimates will violate this relation, and thus can be probed by this generalized shear-ratio test. Combining the lensing eﬀect
for lenses at three diﬀerent redshifts and three diﬀerent source redshifts, a relation between shear ratios is derived which must be valid
independent of a multiplicative bias. We propose these generalized shear-ratio tests as a diagnostic for the presence of systematics in
upcoming weak lensing surveys.

1. Introduction

Weak gravitational lensing based on shear measurements are
challenged by obtaining an unbiased estimate of the shear from
the observed images of faint distant galaxies (see, e.g., Heymans
et al. 2006; Massey et al. 2007; Mandelbaum et al. 2015). Biases
in shear estimates are commonly parametrized through

ˆγ = (1 + m)γ + c ,

(1)

where ˆγ is the expectation value of the shear estimate, γ is the
true shear – a two-component quantity, conveniently written as
a complex number – and m and c are the multiplicative and ad-
ditive biases, respectively. The additive bias itself is a complex
quantity and thus has a phase (or an orientation). As such, it de-
ﬁnes a direction on the sky. The presence of an additive bias can
thus be detected by correlating the estimated shear with other
quantities that deﬁne directions, e.g., the phase of the point-
spread function (PSF) for which any shape measurement must be
corrected, signaling an incomplete PSF-correction, or the pixel
grid of the detector. For the rest of the letter, we will ignore the
additive bias parameter.

In contrast to c, a multiplicative bias cannot be easily iden-
tiﬁed from the data themselves. Such a bias is expected to arise
from the smearing correction of the PSF, pixelization, pixel noise
(“noise bias”; e.g., Melchior & Viola 2012; Bartelmann et al.
2012), and, depending on the method used for shear estimates,
insuﬃcient knowledge of the distribution of intrinsic brightness
proﬁles of sources (“underﬁtting bias”, or “model bias, e.g.,
Voigt & Bridle 2010; Bernstein 2010; Miller et al. 2013; Bern-
stein & Armstrong 2014; Schneider et al. 2015, and references
therein).

Thus, an absolute determination of m from the data appears
extremely challenging. Possible methods for this include the use
of magniﬁcation information (Rozo & Schmidt 2010), or the cal-
ibration of shear as measured from faint galaxy images with the
shear obtained from the lensed cosmic microwave background
(Das et al. 2013). If the multiplicative bias depends on galaxy
properties, such as color or size, a relative bias may be detected
in the data by splitting up the galaxy sample and comparing the
results.

In this letter, we propose a new method for detecting a
redshift-dependent multiplicative bias, which we call ‘general-
ized shear-ratio test’ (GSRT). It is a purely geometrical method,
based on a relation between distances in (statistically) isotropic
universes which we derive in Sect. 3. In contrast to the ‘classical’
shear-ratio test (see Sect. 2), which yields a geometrical probe
of the cosmological model assuming no multiplicative bias, the
GSRT is independent of the cosmological model, and even inde-
pendent of the validity of Einstein’s ﬁeld equation, but capable
of detecting the redshift-dependent bias m, as will be described
in Sect. 4. Furthermore, we will derive a relation between shear
ratios which is even independent of a multiplicative bias, but
only depends on the redshifts of lens and source populations. As
such, this relation oﬀers the opportunity to study the accuracy of
photometric redshifts in cosmological weak lensing surveys.

2. The classical shear-ratio test

Any observable weak lensing quantity that is linear in the shear
depends linearly on the surface mass density Σ of the lens (see,
e.g., Bartelmann & Schneider 2001; Kilbinger 2015). For a lens
(or a population of lenses) at redshift z1 and a source population

at redshift z2, such a shear qunatity S can be expressed as

3. Distance relation in isotropic universes

S = G

D(z1, z2)
D(z2) ≡ G β(z1, z2) ,

(2)

The two-dimensional separation vector ξ between two inﬁnites-
imally close light rays follows the geodesic deviation equation

where D(z1, z2) is the angular-diameter distance of the sources
at z2 as seen from an observer at z1, and D(z2) ≡ D(0, z2) is
the angular-diameter distance of the sources from us. The lens-
ing quantity G is linear in the scaled dimensionless surface mass
density

κsc =

4πG
c2 D(z1) Σ ,

(3)

and depends solely on the properties and distance of the lens
(population), but is independent of the source redshift. In Eq. (2),
we have deﬁned the distance ratio β, which for a given lens char-
acterizes the lensing strength as a function of source redshift.

The true image ellipticity ǫ of a background galaxy is an un-
biased estimate of the reduced shear γ/(1 − κ) (Seitz & Schnei-
der 1997), where κ = κsc β(z1, z2) is the convergence of the lens
at z1 for a source population at redshift z2. Assuming that the
convergence is much smaller than unity, we neglect the diﬀer-
ence between shear and reduced shear. Then, an estimate of S is
obtained as a linear combination of image ellipticities ǫ, whose
expectation value is

(4)

Γ(z1, z2) = G(z1) β(z1, z2) M(z2) ,
where M = (1 +m), with m being the aforementioned multiplica-
tive bias in shear measurements. For example, Γ(z1, z2) could
be a weighted integral over separation of the tangential shear in
galaxy-galaxy lensing for lenses at z1, measured for sources at z2,
where the weight can be chosen such as to optimize the signal-
to-noise ratio of the measurement (e.g., Bartelmann & Schneider
2001).

Hence, the observable signal Γ depends (i) on the properties
of the lens described by G, (ii) on the cosmological parameters
through the distance ratio β, and (iii) on the multiplicative bias
in shear measurements. Furthermore, it also depends (iv) on the
reliability of the estimates of (photometric) redshifts.

The classical shear ratio test (Jain & Taylor 2003; Taylor
et al. 2007; Kitching et al. 2015) considers a lens (population)
at redshift z1, and two source populations at redshifts z2 and z3.
The ratio of their lensing signals,

R(z1; z2, z3) ≡

Γ(z1, z3)

eliminates the dependence on the lens properties. Due to its de-
pendence on the distance ratio B, the shear-ratio R was proposed
as a probe for cosmological parameters. However, the sensitivity
of B on, e.g., the equation-of-state parameter w of dark energy
turns out to be rather weak, so that highly accurate measure-
ments of R are needed to turn this into a competitive cosmolog-
ical probe. Furthermore, unbiased estimates of shear and red-
shifts which enter the shear ratio test provide a huge challenge
for precision weak lensing experiments. It is therefore of great
interest to ﬁnd observational probes for a potential multiplicative
bias in shear measurements and a bias of photometric redshifts
which is insensitive to assumptions about the cosmological pa-
rameters.

In the next section, we will derive relations between cosmo-
logical distances which are independent of cosmological param-
eters and which allow us to construct combinations of R which
carry no longer a dependence on cosmology.

where λ is the aﬃne parameter along the light rays, and T (λ)
is the optical tidal matrix, which is determined by the Ricci
and Weyl tensors of the spacetime metric (see, e.g., Chap. 3 of
Schneider et al. 1992, and Seitz et al. 1994).
In an isotropic
universe, the tidal part of T vanishes, so that T (λ) = T (λ) I,
where I is the two-dimensional unit matrix and T (λ) is a scalar
function, proportional to the local density.
If the two light rays intersect at a vertex at λi under an angle
θ, we can write ξ(λ) = Di(λ)θ, where Di satisﬁes the diﬀerential
equation

(7)

d2D
dλ2
with initial conditions Di(λi) = 0, (dDi/dλ)(λi) = ˙Di, where the
latter value depends on the choice of the aﬃne parameter. By
deﬁnition, Di(λ) is the angular-diameter distance of a source at
λ, seen from an observer at λi < λ.

The second-order diﬀerential equation (7) has two indepen-
dent solutions; we choose them to be Di(λ) and D j(λ), i.e., the
angular-diameter distances as measured from observers located
at λi and λ j , λi, respectively. A third solution, Dk(λ), must
necessarily be a linear combination of the other two. If we write
it in the form

Dk(λ) = ChD j(λ)Di(λk) − D j(λk)Di(λ)i ,

where C is a constant, then we see that the ﬁrst initial condition
is satisﬁed, Dk(λk) = 0. For the second initial condition, we have

where W(λ) is the Wronskian

W(λ) =

(8)

From Eq. (7), one sees directly that dW/dλ = 0, i.e., W(λ) is
constant. We can calculate this constant considering W at λ j,
which yields
W = W(λ j) = Di(λ j) ˙D j ,
yielding C = ( ˙Dk/ ˙D j) D−1

i (λ j). Therefore,

Dk(λ) =

˙Dk
˙D j

Di(λ j) hD j(λ)Di(λk) − D j(λk)Di(λ)i .

(9)

Thus, we have expressed the angular-diameter distance as seen
from an observer at aﬃne parameter λk by the corresponding
expression for the angular-diameter distance for observers at λi
and λ j. The resulting expression contains the initial conditions at
λ j and λk. If we now specialize Eq. (9) to the case of λi = 0, with
the corresponding angular-diameter distance denoted as D(λ),
we obtain

Dk(λ) =

˙Dk
˙D j

D(λ j) hD j(λ)D(λk) − D j(λk)D(λ)i .

Combining Eqs. (9) and (10), we then ﬁnd

Dk(λ) =

(11)

The ﬁnal equality does not contain the initial conditions any-
more. It is valid for any spacetime which is isotropic around the
observer through which the radial light bundle passes. Further-
more, this equation is not referring to the Einstein ﬁeld equation,
and is therefore independent of the validity of General Relativity,
as long a spacetime is characterized by a metric.

If, in addition to isotropy, we assume a spatially homoge-
neous spacetime, which can then be expressed in the form of the
Robertson–Walker metric, the initial conditions are ˙Di = (1 + zi),
where zi is the redshift with which sources at λi are seen by the
observer at λ = 0 (or redshift zero). For this, we have chosen a
parametrization of the aﬃne parameter such that it locally coin-
cides with the comoving distance as seen from the observer. In
what follows, we assume that the isotropic universe is such that
an invertible relation between aﬃne parameter and redshift ex-
ists, so that redshift can be used to label the relative order of ob-
jects (in the sense that an object at z2 lies behind one at z1 < z2).
This excludes, for example, bouncing models, for which z(λ) is
not a monotonic function.

We will now identify Di(λ j) as the distance D(zi, z j), and
D(λ j) as D(z j), i.e., the quantities occurring in the distance ratio
β (see Eq. 2). Setting λ = λl in Eq. (11) and dividing the resulting
expression by DkDl, we obtain with the deﬁnition (2) that

β jlβik − β jkβil = βi j(cid:16)β jl − β jk(cid:17) ,
(12)
an expression between distance ratios βi j ≡ β(zi, z j). This can be
manipulated, by division through βi jβ jk, to contain just ratios of
β’s with the ﬁrst index being the same – or if we set 0 ≤ zi <
z j < zk, zl, with the lower redshift being the same. Hence, the
resulting expression only contains the ratios B that were deﬁned
in Eq. (5),

B(z j; zk, zl) =

B(zi; z j, zl) − 1
B(zi; z j, zk) − 1

.

(13)

Of course, the relation (12) or (13) must hold in a Robertson–
Walker metric. The proof of this is outlined in the appendix.

4. Generalized shear ratio tests

The relation between distances, as derived in the previous sec-
tion, can now be used to obtain ratios between shear observables
Γ. According to Eq. (5), shear ratios depend on the ratios of mul-
tiplicative bias factors, hence they can not be used to determine
the absolute multiplicative bias, but only their relative values.

Consider now two populations of lenses at redshifts z1 and
z2, and sources at redshifts z2, z3 and z4. Combining Eq. (5) with
Eq. (13), setting (i, j, k, l) = (1, 2, 3, 4), we ﬁnd that

R(z2; z3, z4) =

R(z1; z2, z4) − M(z4)/M(z2)
R(z1; z2, z3) − M(z3)/M(z2)

.

(14)

This relation between ratios of shear observables is independent
of the cosmological model and the validity of the ﬁeld equation
of General Relativity, and contains only ratios of the multiplica-
tive bias at the three source redshifts. Hence we have found a
cosmology-independent shear ratio test. The special form of

Eq. (14) has been chosen by assuming that the sources at the
nearest redshift (here z2) can be measured most reliably, since
these sources probably will on average be larger than those at
higher redshift. Thus, we normalize the multiplicative bias by
that for sources at z2.

The redshift dependence may not be the primary depen-
dence of the multiplicative bias; rather, one might suspect that
it depends on image size, signal-to-noise ratio, galaxy color etc.
Those dependencies can be studied by splitting the source sam-
ple. A test based on Eq. (14) may serve as an additional or com-
plemetary ‘sanity check’.

Furthermore, we can consider three lens populations at red-
shift z1, z2, and z3, and three source populations at z3, z4, and z5.
Setting (i, j, k, l) → (1, 3, 4, 5) in (14), we ﬁnd with (5) that
M(z5)
R(z3; z4, z5)"R(z1; z3, z4) −
M(z3)
On the other hand, by choosing (i, j, k, l) → (2, 3, 4, 5), we get
R(z3; z4, z5)"R(z2; z3, z4) −

M(z3)# = R(z1; z3, z5) −

M(z3)# = R(z2; z3, z5) −

M(z5)
M(z3)

M(z4)

M(z4)

. (15)

. (16)

Subtracting (16) from (15), the ratios of the multiplicative bias
factors cancel out, and we are left with
R(z3; z4, z5) [R(z2; z3, z4) − R(z1; z3, z4)]
= R(z2; z3, z5) − R(z1; z3, z5) ,

(17)

a relation that just contains the observable shear ratios! Hence,
this relation between observables must be obeyed; its viola-
tion would indicate a problem with the redshift estimates of the
sources and/or lenses. Whereas (14) probes a combination of the
multiplication bias and redshift estimates, (17) solely probes the
latter; in this way, these two eﬀects can be disentangled.

Curiously, these relations are insensitive to getting the red-
shifts right. For example, Eq. (14) is valid for all zi, 1 ≤ i ≤ 4.
If one believes that the sources have a redshift z4, but in reality
are located at redshift z′4 , z4, the relation (14) still remains true.
What is important, though, is that the lens redshift z2, occurring
on the left-hand side, is the same as the source redshift z2 appear-
ing on the right. We will study in a future work how errors in the
mean, the dispersion about the mean, and catastrophic outliers
in photometric redshift estimates aﬀect these GSRTs.

5. Discussion

We have derived two relations between measured shear ratios
which are independent of the cosmological model, following
from two newly derived relations between distances in isotropic
space-times. The ﬁrst of these GSRTs, Eq. (14), relates shear
ratios to ratios of the multiplicative bias. Hence, if
R1234 ≡ R(z2; z3, z4) [R(z1; z2, z3) − 1] − R(z1; z2, z4) + 1
deviates from zero, a redshift-dependent multiplicative bias is a
likely origin. Another possible reason for R1234 , 0 could be
found in problems with redshift estimates of the source galaxies.
The latter is probed by the relation (17), which is independent of
the multiplicative bias.

In order to turn the GSRT into a diagnostic tool for future
weak lensing applications, several issues need to be studied be-
fore. First, the sensitivity for measuring statistically signiﬁcant
deviations of R1234 from zero depends on the number of lenses
and sources available for this test, i.e., on the sky area of the

weak lensing survey and its depth. It may be conceivable that the
lens population is selected based on spectroscopic redshifts. For
example, the SDSS has obtained far more than one million spec-
troscopic galaxy redshifts (Alam et al. 2015), and the upcoming
experiments 4MOST (de Jong et al. 2014) and DESI (Flaugher
& Bebek 2014) will increase this number by more than an order
of magnitude. Alternatively, or in combination, the lens pop-
ulation can be chosen as galaxy clusters, where the upcoming
eROSITA X-ray survey mission is expected to detect some 105
clusters (e.g., Pillepich et al. 2012).

Second, a practical application of the GSRT requires binning
of the lens and source samples into redshift bins. Optimal strate-
gies for this binning need to be developed. The estimators will
also be aﬀected by the dispersion of the photometric redshift es-
timates which need to be accounted for.

Third, we have assumed an isotropic universe. Our universe
is clearly not isotropic on small scales, and hence the Weyl part
of the optical tidal matrix T in (6) does not vanish. However,
the diﬀerence between the mean distances in a locally inhomo-
geneous universe and the distances in the corresponding smooth
universe is extremely small (see Sect. 4.5 of Schneider et al.
1992, and references therein, as well as the recent detailed dis-
cussion by Kaiser & Peacock 2016).

Appendix A: The validity of Eq. (12) in a

Robertson–Walker metric

In this appendix we outline the proof that Eq. (12) holds in a
Robertson–Walker metric. This can be shown using the follow-
ing steps: (i) For the distance ratios β, one can either use the
angular-diameter distances, or the comoving angular-diameter
distances. Hence,

β(zi, z j) =

sn(cid:16)√|K| [χ j − χi](cid:17)
sn(cid:16) √|K| χ j(cid:17)

=

sn(x j − xi)
sn(x j)

,

where the function sn(x) is either the sine or the hyperbolic sine,
depending on the sign of the curvature parameter K, and in the
limiting case of K = 0, it is the identity. Furthermore, χ j is the

comoving distance to redshift x j, and we deﬁned x j = √|K|χ j.

(ii) Using the above expression, we can write Eq. (12) after mul-
tiplication by sn(xk) sn(xl) as
sn(xl − x j) sn(xk − xi) − sn(xk − x j) sn(xl − xi)

sn(x j − xi)
sn(x j)

=

hsn(xl − x j) sn(xk) − sn(xk − x j) sn(xl)i .
(iii) Next we make use of the addition theorem, sn(a − b) =
sn(a) cn(b) − cn(a) sn(b), where cn(x) is either cos(x), cosh(x),
or ≡ 1, depending on K. After applying the addition theorem to
the foregoing equation, a term-by-term comparison of both sides
shows its validity.
