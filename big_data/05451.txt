from Chow motives to numerical motives. We compare two natural
deﬁnitions, which turn out to be very diﬀerent. We investigate fullness,
conservativity and exactness of these two functors.

Introduction

In order to understand algebraic cycles over smooth projective k-schemes,

the functor

num : CHM(k) −→ NUM(k),

from Chow motives to numerical motives (over the base ﬁeld k) has proved
to be an important tool, one reason being that, contrary to CHM(k), the
category NUM(k) is semisimple [Jan92].

Some examples were it has been successfully exploited are the proof of
Bloch’s conjecture for surfaces dominated by a product of curves [Kim05],
the proof that rational and numerical equivalence coincide for products of
elliptic curves over ﬁnite ﬁelds [Kah03], and the proof of the Bloch-Beilinson
conjecture for products of elliptic curves (over some special ﬁelds) [Jan07].

The main classical properties of the functor num are the following.

(1) The functor num is full (by construction),
(2) The kernel of num is the biggest proper tensor ideal of CHM(k)

[AK02, Lemme 7.1.1],

GIUSEPPE ANCONA

(3) The functor num is conservative when restricted to Chow motives

arising from abelian varieties [Kim05].

Keeping the above results in mind, in order to understand algebraic cycles
over k-schemes that are smooth but not projective, it seems useful to provide
a mixed analogue of such a functor, that would extend num from CHM(k)
to DMgm(k), Voevodsky’s triangulated category of geometric motives.

There are at least two reasonable candidates for this extension. The ﬁrst

one is the quotient functor

p : DMgm(k) −→ DMgm(k)/N ,

where N is the biggest proper tensor ideal of DMgm(k). The second one is
a triangulated functor

π : DMgm(k) −→ Db(NUM(k)),

deﬁned by Bondarko (see Lemma 5.2 and Remark 5.3) using the fact that a
mixed motive is an iterated extension of Chow motives, so one applies num
to each of them.

The aim of this article is to compare these two functors, which surprisingly

(at least for the author) turn out to be very diﬀerent.

Theorem 0.1. Let T ⊂ DMgm(k) be the smallest triangulated category con-
taining ﬁnite dimensional Chow motives. Then the functor π is conservative
when restricted to T (Proposition 6.4).

Moreover, when the base ﬁeld k is not algebraic over a ﬁnite ﬁeld, the

following holds :

(1) The quotient DMgm(k)/N has no triangulated structure such that
the functor p : DMgm(k) −→ DMgm(k)/N is triangulated. (Propo-
sition 6.3),

(2) π is not full, even when restricted to T (Proposition 6.1),
(3) p is not conservative, even when restricted to T (Proposition 6.5).
(4) Both (pseudo-abelianisations of ) Db(NUM(k)) and DMgm(k)/N are

semisimple categories (Remark 2.4).

It is particularly surprisingly for us that, contrary to the pure case, p is
not conservative (for this reason we think of π as being the good construction
for future applications).

Recall that the category T contains the motive of any commutative alge-
braic group (Remark 5.6). Conjecturally all Chow motives are ﬁnite dimen-
sional [Kim05], hence T should be the whole DMgm(k).

The hypothesis on the base ﬁeld k in the theorem above is necessary.
Indeed, when k is algebraic over a ﬁnite ﬁeld, the functor num is conjectured
to be an equivalence of categories. Under this conjecture, both p and π are
equivalences of categories.

NUMERICAL FUNCTORS ON VOEVODSKY’S MOTIVES

There is a piece missing in the complete description of these functors.

Question 0.2. Does the inclusion ker F ⊂ ker π hold for any nonzero tensor
triangulated functor F : DMgm(k) −→ C ?

Note that, if the answer to this question was aﬃrmative, then any real-

ization functor would be conservative (when restricted to T ).

Remark 0.3. One of the main conjectures of the theory of motives predicts
that there should be a tannakian (non semisimple) category of motives M
inside DMgm(k) and DMgm(k) itself should be the derived category of
M. Moreover, it is conjectured that the subcategory of semisimple objects
Mss ⊂ M should be related1 to NUM(k) (but not equivalent: NUM(k)
cannot be tannakian because it has odd objects).

Of course, the two functors p and π we consider here do not have any
relation with the inclusions M ֒→ DMgm(k) for trivial reasons: ﬁrst be-
cause they go in the opposite direction, and second because the categories
DMgm(k)/N and Db(NUM(k)) are semisimple.
Organization of the paper. We start by recalling generalities on rigid
categories (Section 1).
In Section 2 we introduce the notations and the
objects that will be studied in the rest of the paper. The following two
sections present the tools we need : ﬁnite dimensionality (after Kimura et
al.) and weight structures (after Bondarko et al.). In Section 5 we deﬁne
the functor π of the introduction and show that it is a tensor triangulated
functor. Finally, the comparison between the functors π and p is carried on
in Section 6.

Acknowledgments. I would like to thank Tom Bachmann, Mikhail Bon-
darko and Shane Kelly for providing useful explanations. I am also grateful
to Javier Fres´an and Marco Maculan for helpful comments on the exposition.
Finally, I thank the referee for very useful comments.

1. Reminders on trace, radical and numerical ideal

Let F be a commutative Q-algebra. In this section we consider a rigid,
symmetric, F -linear and pseudo-abelian category A with unit object 1 such
that EndA(1) = F · id.

Deﬁnition 1.1. [AK02, §7.1] Let f : X → X be an endomorphism in A.
Let ηf : 1 → X ⊗ X ∨ be the morphism adjoint to f and ǫ : X ⊗ X ∨ → 1 be
the morphism adjoint to idX. Deﬁne the trace of f to be the unique scalar
tr(f ) ∈ F such that tr(f ) · id1 = ǫ ◦ ηf .

Deﬁnition 1.2. [AK02, Lemme 7.1.1] We say that a morphism f : X → Y
in A belongs to the numerical ideal if for all g : Y → X the trace of g ◦ f
vanishes.

1More precisely, under the K¨unneth conjecture, one can correct the sign of symmetries
in the tensor product to have only even objects and deduce a tannakian category. For
details see for example [Mil13, §7]

4

GIUSEPPE ANCONA

Deﬁnition 1.3. An ideal of A is a collection of morphisms in A which is
stable by internal sums and external compositions. It is a tensor ideal if it
is also stable by external tensor products.

Proposition 1.4. [AK02, Proposition 7.1.4(b)] The numerical ideal of A
is a tensor ideal and any other tensor ideal is contained in it.

Deﬁnition 1.5. [AK02, D´eﬁnition 1.4.1] The radical of A is the collection
of morphisms f : X → Y such that, for all g : Y → X, the morphism
id − g ◦ f is invertible.

Proposition 1.6. [Kel64] The radical of A is an ideal (which is nontensor
in general).

Recall that in such a category A, the group of permutation of n elements
acts on X ⊗n, for any object X. In particular one can deﬁne the n-th sym-
metric power SymnX and the n-th alternating power ∧nX of X as direct
factors of X ⊗n via the usual projectors.

Deﬁnition 1.7. [Kim05] An object X in A is odd if SymnX = 0 for some
n. It is even if ∧nX = 0 for some n. It is ﬁnite dimensional if it can be
decomposed as sum of an odd and an even object.

2. Setting

Let us ﬁx a base ﬁeld k and a commutative Q-algebra F , which will
play the role of ring of coeﬃcients. Let DMgm(k)F be the non-eﬀective
category of geometric motives over k with coeﬃcients in F [Voe00, §2]. It is
a triangulated, rigid, symmetric and pseudo-abelian F -linear category with
unit object 1 such that EndDMgm(k)F (1) = F ·id. It canonically contains the
category CHM(k)F of non-eﬀective Chow motives over k with F coeﬃcients
[Voe00, Proposition 2.1.4].

Deﬁnition 2.1. Deﬁne C ⊆ CHM(k)F to be the full subcategory of ﬁnite
dimensional motives. Write T ⊆ DMgm(k)F for the triangulated category
generated by C.

By Kimura [Kim05, Corollary 5.11 and Proposition 6.9], C is a rigid,
symmetric and pseudo-abelian F -linear category. We will see that T is a
triangulated, rigid, symmetric and pseudo-abelian F -linear category.

Deﬁnition 2.2. Write N for the numerical ideal (Deﬁnition 1.2) of T and
deﬁne the functor num : C → C to be the quotient of C by its numerical ideal
(which is the restriction of N to C).

In our motivic setting the functor num is nothing else than the projection

to the category of numerical motives [And05, Exemples 2.4(1)].

Deﬁnition 2.3. We deﬁne T to be the bounded derived category of C. We
will call it the triangulated category of numerical motives.

NUMERICAL FUNCTORS ON VOEVODSKY’S MOTIVES

Remark 2.4. By a theorem of Jannsen [Jan92], C is abelian semisimple, hence
the category T is equivalent to C
, and, in particular, it is also semisimple.
Note that, as C is a rigid, symmetric and pseudo-abelian F -linear category,
T is a triangulated, rigid, symmetric and pseudo-abelian F -linear category.
Note also that the same proof of Jannsen applies to show that the pseudo-

⊕Z

abelian envelope of T /N is semisimple2.

3. Finite dimensional motives

Along this section, C is the category of ﬁnite dimensional Chow motives
over k with coeﬃcients in F (Deﬁnitions 1.7 and 2.1) and C is its quotient as
in Deﬁnition 2.2. We recall results due to Kimura, O’Sullivan and Jannsen.

Proposition 3.1. [Kim05, Corollary 5.11 and Proposition 6.9] The category
C is tensor, rigid, additive and pseudo-abelian.

Theorem 3.2. [Jan07, Corollary 3.4] For any X in C the ideal N (X, X) ⊂
EndC(X) of endomorphisms belonging to the numerical ideal (Deﬁnition 1.2)
is nilpotent.

Corollary 3.3. [Kim05, Corollary 7.8] All projectors in C can be lifted to
projectors in C.

Theorem 3.4. [Jan92] The category C is tensor, rigid and semi-simple.

Note that, because of Proposition 3.1 and Corollary 3.3, the quotient

category C is already pseudo-abelian.

Proposition 3.5. [AK02, Th´eor`eme 8.2.2] The radical of C (Deﬁnition 1.5)
coincides with the numerical ideal.

4. Weights in motives

We keep notations from Section 2, in particular C and T are the categories
of motives (over k with coeﬃcients in F ) of Deﬁnition 2.1. We summarize
results due to Bondarko and Wildeshaus in the following theorem.

Theorem 4.1. The category T is pseudo-abelian. Moreover, for each pair
of integers a ≤ b there exists a full pseudo-abelian subcategory

Ta,b ⊂ T

called the category of motives with motivic weights between a and b (when
a = b we shall write T=a for Ta,a and call it the category of pure motives of
weight a), such that the collection of categories {Ta,b} satisﬁes :

(1) The inclusion Tc,d ⊂ Ta,b, for all integers a ≤ c and b ≥ d,
(2) The equality Ta,b ∩ Tc,d = Ta,d, for all integers a ≥ c and b ≥ d,
(3) The equality Ta,b[n] = Ta+n,b+n,
(4) The equality T=0 = C,

2As well as the pseudo-abelian envelope of the quotient of DMgm(k)F by its numerical

ideal, apply for example [And05, Proposition 2.6] to a realization functor

6

GIUSEPPE ANCONA

(5) The inclusion Tc,d ⊗ Ta,b ⊂ Ta+c,b+d,
(6) For any M ∈ T there exist a ≤ b such that M ∈ Ta,b,
(7) For any triangle A → B → C in T ,

A, C ∈ Ta,b ⇒ B ∈ Ta,b,

(8) When b < c, HomT (Ta,b, Tc,d) = 0,
(9) For any a ≤ b < c and X ∈ Ta,c there exists a (nonunique) triangle

Xa,b −→ X −→ Xb+1,c

δ−→ Xa,b[1],

with Xa,b ∈ Ta,b, Xb+1,c ∈ Tb+1,c and δ in the radical of T (Deﬁnition
1.5),

(10) Let a ≤ b < c and let f : X → Y be a morphism in Ta,c. For any

choice of triangles as in (9) f extends to a morphism of triangles

Xa,b

/ X

/ Xb+1,c

fa,b

f

fb+1,c

Ya,b

/ Y

/ Yb+1,c

(not in a unique way),

(11) Let a ≤ b < c and X ∈ Ta,c. Any triangle of the form

X ′

a,b −→ X −→ X ′

b+1,c

+1−→,

with X ′
form

a,b ∈ Ta,b, X ′

b+1,c ∈ Tb+1,c is isomorphic to a triangle of the

Xa,b ⊕ Xb −→ X −→ Xb+1,c ⊕ Xb[1] δ⊕id−→ Xa,b[1] ⊕ Xb[1],

for some Xb ∈ Tb (with Xa,b, Xb+1,c and δ as in (9)).

These results due to Bondarko [Bon10, Theorem 4.3.2 and Lemma 5.2.1]
and valid on the whole DMgm(k)F , with exception of parts (9) and (11),
proved in [Wil15, Proposition 1.2 and Corollary 1.3] by Wildeshaus. Al-
though Wildeshaus works with the subcategory DMab
gm(k)F ⊂ T of mixed
motives of abelian type [Wil15, Deﬁnition 1.1(c)], the only thing used in his
proof is ﬁnite dimensionality.

Deﬁnition 4.2. The length of a motive M is the smallest natural number
b − a such that M ∈ Ta,b.

The length measures how far a motive is from being pure, for instance
Chow motives are of length zero and the motive of an aﬃne curve is (in
general) of length one.

5. Triangulated numerical motives

In this section we construct a functor π : T → T extending the functor
num : C → C (see Deﬁnitions 2.1 and 2.3). We show that it is a tensor and
triangulated functor. Proofs will use the categories Ta,b, from Theorem 4.1,
and the notion of length of motives introduced in Deﬁnition 4.2.

Lemma 5.1. Let π : T → T be any (additve, F -linear) triangulated functor,
extending the functor num : C → C. Then it satisﬁes :

(1) For any morphism of triangles

X=a

/ X

/ Xa+1,b

f=a

f

fa+1,b

Y=a

/ Y

/ Ya+1,b

as in Theorem 4.1(10), the morphsim

π(f ) : π(X) → π(Y )

coincides with

π(f=a) ⊕ π(fa+1,b) : π(X=a) ⊕ π(Xa+1,b) → π(Y=a) ⊕ π(Ya+1,b),

(2) For any morphism in the radical of T (Deﬁnition 1.5)

δ : Xa+1,b → X=a[1],

with Xa+1,b ∈ Ta+1,b and X=a ∈ T=a, one has

π(δ) = 0.

Proof. Let us start showing (2). We ﬁrst write a morphism of triangles as
in Theorem 4.1(10),

X=a+1

/ Xa+1,b

/ Xa+2,b

δa+1

δ

X=a[1]

id /

/ X=a[1]

/ 0

and deduce we are reduced to show that π(δa+1) = 0. Note now that δa+1
belongs to the radical because the radical is an ideal (Proposition 1.6) and
δ belongs to it. After shifting we can suppose that δa+1 is a morphism in C.
By Proposition 3.5, δa+1 belongs to the numerical ideal N . As π restricted
to C coincides with the functor num, we conclude π(δa+1) = 0.

Let us turn to (1). By (2) we have π(X) = π(X=a) ⊕ π(Xa+1,b) and

π(Y ) = π(Y=a) ⊕ π(Ya+1,b), hence it is enough to show that

End(π(Xa+1,b), π(Y=a)) = 0.

This follows from the equivalence T ∼= C

⊕Z

of Remark 2.4.

GIUSEPPE ANCONA

Lemma 5.2. There exists a unique additive, F -linear functor π : T → T
commuting with shifts, extending the functor num : C → C and verifying the
property (1) from Lemma 5.1.

Proof. We show the existence and unicity of π on the diﬀerent subcategories
Ta,b by induction on the natural number l = b − a.

When b = a we can suppose after shifting that a = b = 0. As T=0 = C by

Theorem 4.1(4), the functor π coincides there with num.

Let f : X → Y be a morphism in Ta,b. Write a morphism of triangles as

in Theorem 4.1(10),

X=a

/ X

/ Xa+1,b

f=a

f

fa+1,b

Y=a

/ Y

/ Ya+1,b

and note that we know by induction that the morphisms π(f=a) and π(fa+1,b)
are uniquely determined. Then property (1) from Lemma 5.1 forces the value
of π(f ). This shows the unicity of π.

To show the existence it is enough to prove that the maps π(f=a) and

π(fa+1,a+l) vanish, for any morphism of triangles of the shape

X=a

/ X

/ Xa+1,a+l

f=a

0

fa+1,a+l

Y=a

/ Y

/ Ya+1,a+l

(note that the maps π(f=a) and π(fa+1,a+l) are well determined by induc-
tion).

Applying the functor Hom(X=a, ·) to the second triangle in the above

diagram, one constructs a factorisation

xrrrrrrrrrr

Ya+1,a+l[−1] δ

X=a

f=a

/ Y=a

which implies that f=a belongs to the radical (Deﬁnition 1.5), as the radical
is an ideal (Proposition 1.6) and δ belongs to it. After shifting we can
suppose that f=a is a morphism in C. By Proposition 3.5, f=a belongs to
the numerical ideal N . As π restricted to C coincides with the functor num,
we conclude π(f=a) = 0 .

Similarly, there is a factorization

Xa+1,a+l

δ′

/ X=a[1]

yssssssssss

fa+1,a+l

Ya+1,a+l

with δ′ in the radical. By functoriality it is enough to show that π(δ′) = 0.
We write

X=a+1

/ Xa+1,a+l

/ Xa+2,a+l

δ′
a+1

δ′

X=a[1]

id

/ X=a[1]

/ 0

hence π(δ′) = π(δ′
to conclude that δ′

a+1) by property (1) from Lemma 5.1. We argue as above
a+1 ∈ N , hence π(δ′
(cid:3)

a+1) = 0.

The rest of the section is devoted to show that the unique functor π from

Lemma 5.2 is a tensor triangulated functor.

Remark 5.3.

(1) If one wants to work with a motivic category which is
larger than T one could consider a similar construction due to Bon-
darko [Bon09, Remark 6.3.2(3)], who deﬁnes a triangulated functor

DMgm(k)F −→ Db(NUM(k)F )

(and even a functor DMgm(k)F −→ K b(CHM(k)F )). Its restriction
to T coincides with our π because of the unicity part of Lemma 5.2.
The functor considered by Bondarko was not known to be a tensor
functor. This has been recently established by Bachmann [Bac16,
Lemma 18]. The rest of the section can be seen as an alternative
proof of these facts in our simpliﬁed context.

(2) In the next section we will show that π is conservative on T . Ex-
tending this result to the whole DMgm(k)F without assuming ﬁnite
dimensionality seems out of reach with the present technology.

Proposition 5.4. The unique functor π from Lemma 5.2 is triangulated.

Proof. Let us ﬁx a triangle

A −→ B −→ C

in T . We want to show that the functor π induces a triangle in T , or
equivalently a long exact sequence in the semisimple category C.

After shifting we can suppose that A, B, C ∈ T0,l. Write a triangle

as in Theorem 4.1(9), and similarly for B and C.

Step (i). By Theorem 4.1(10) we get maps

A0 −→ B0 −→ C0

(note that this is not a triangle in general). We claim that C0 is a direct
factor of B0 (and the map above is the induced projection).

Indeed, consider the commutative diagram

B0

id

B

/ C

/ A[1]

id

B1,l

/ X

/ A[1]

where both vertical and horizontal lines are triangles. By looking at the
bottom horizontal triangle we deduce that X ∈ T1,l, using Theorem 4.1(7).
We get the claim by Theorem 4.1(11) applied to the second vertical arrow.

Step (ii). The functor π in degree zero applied to the triangle A → B → C

reads

π(A0) −→ π(B′

0) ⊕ π(C0) −→ π(C0)

for some B′
surjective by Step (i). Let us show that it is also exact in the middle.

0 ∈ C. This is a complex (as π is a functor) and the last arrow is

triangle

0 −→ B′ −→ B1,l

is of the shape as in Theorem 4.1(9).

Second, consider the commutative diagram

of triangles. Applying the argument of step (i) to the triangle

C1,l[−1] −→ A −→ B′,

we deduce that B′
constructed

0 is a direct factor of A0. In particular, the sequence we

π(A0) −→ π(B′

0) ⊕ π(C0) −→ π(C0)

is exact not only on the right but also in the middle, and it can be rewritten

π(A′

0) ⊕ π(C0) −→ π(C0) −→ 0.

0) ⊕ π(B′

0) −→ π(B′

Step (iii). By continuing this procedure we get the long exact sequence
we wanted. Note also that by passing from the triangle A → B → C to the
triangle C1,l[−1] → A → B′ one of the elements has length strictly smaller
hence the procedure stops after ﬁnitely many steps.
(cid:3)

Lemma 5.5. The category T ⊆ DMgm(k)F is stable by tensor products,
duals and twists.

Proof. Let us show the statement for tensor product (for duals and twists
the argument is analogue). We show that A ⊗ B ∈ T for any A, B ∈ T by
induction on the sum of the lengths of A and B.

When the sum is zero we are done as C is a tensor category. For a higher
sum, we can suppose (without loss of generality) that A has positive length.
Then write a triangle

as in Theorem 4.1(9). From this we deduce a triangle

Aa −→ A −→ Aa+1,b

Aa ⊗ B −→ A ⊗ B −→ Aa+1,b ⊗ B.

As the ﬁrst and the third terms are in T (by induction) so is the middle
one.
(cid:3)

Remark 5.6. The same proof shows that the category DMab
gm(k)F of mixed
motives of abelian type [Wil15, Deﬁnition 1.1(c)] is tensor rigid. It contains
in particular the tensor category generated by 1-motives, hence the motives
of commutative algebraic groups [AEWH15].

Proposition 5.7. The functor π from Lemma 5.2 commutes with tensor
products, symmetries and duals.

GIUSEPPE ANCONA

Proof. We show the statement for the tensor product (for symmetries and
duals the argument is analogue). Given two morphisms f : A → C and
g : B → D in T we show that π(A ⊗ B) = π(A) ⊗ π(B), π(C ⊗ D) =
π(C) ⊗ π(D) and π(f ⊗ g) = π(f ) ⊗ π(g).

We can suppose A, C ∈ Ta,a+l and B, D ∈ Tb,b+m. We argue by induction
on the sum l + m. When this sum is zero we are done as this reduces to the
fact that π is a tensor functor on C.

For a positive sum, we can suppose (without loss of generality) that l > 0.

Then write a triangle

Aa −→ A −→ Aa+1,a+l

δ−→ Aa[1],

as in Theorem 4.1(9). From this we deduce a triangle

Aa ⊗ B −→ A ⊗ B −→ Aa+1,a+l ⊗ B δ⊗id−→ (Aa ⊗ B)[1].

By Lemma 5.1(2), we have π(δ) = 0. By induction hypothesis π(δ ⊗ id) =
π(δ) ⊗ π(id), hence it also vanishes.

As the functor π is triangulated the two triangles above give

π(A) = π(Aa+1,a+l) ⊕ π(Aa) , π(A ⊗ B) = π(Aa+1,a+l ⊗ B) ⊕ π(Aa ⊗ B).

Putting these two equalities together and using the induction hypothesis we
conclude that π(A ⊗ B) = π(A) ⊗ π(B). The argument for π(C ⊗ D) =
π(C) ⊗ π(D) and π(f ⊗ g) = π(f ) ⊗ π(g) is analogue.

6. Results

In this section we compare the functor π : T → T from Lemma 5.2 with

the quotient functor

p : T → T /N

(see Deﬁnition 2.2). Again in this section we will use the categories Ta,b,
from Theorem 4.1, and the notion of length of motives (Deﬁnition 4.2).

Proposition 6.1. The functor π is not full, provided that the base ﬁeld k
is not algebraic over a ﬁnite ﬁeld.

Proof. Consider a nonzero morphism n : X → Y in C belonging to the
N (when k is not algebraic over a ﬁnite ﬁeld there are plenty of nonzero
cycles that are numerically trivial, such as degree zero divisors over smooth
projective curves of nonzero genus). Take a motive C sitting in the triangle

−→ X

n−→ Y.

C

Note that, by Lemma 5.1(1), we have π(C) = π(X) ⊕ π(Y )[−1].

Deﬁne the morphism α : π(X) → π(C) as the direct sum of the identity
map on π(X) and the zero map to π(Y )[−1]. We claim that α is not the

image any morphism f : X → C. If so, one would have a triangle

with r ∈ N . This means that idX +r belongs to the image of the composition
by g,

that is, to the kernel of the composition by n

g ◦ · : Hom(X, C) −→ Hom(X, X)

n ◦ ·

: Hom(X, X) −→ Hom(X, Y ).

In other words, n ◦ (idX + r) = 0.

On the other hand, by Corollary 3.3, idX + r is invertible, hence n = 0,
(cid:3)

which leads to a contradiction.

Remark 6.2. When the base ﬁeld k is algebraic over a ﬁnite ﬁeld it is conjec-
tured that the projection num : C → C (Deﬁnition 2.2) is an equivalence of
categories. Assuming this conjecture one can show by induction on length
that π : T → T is also an equivalence.

Proposition 6.3. Suppose that the base ﬁeld k is not algebraic over a ﬁnite
ﬁeld. Then there exists a motive X ∈ T0,1 and an endomorphism f : X → X
belonging to N such that for any diagram

X=0

f0

X=0

/ X

f

/ X

/ X=1

f1

/ X=1

as in Theorem 4.1(10), the maps f0 and f1 do not belong to N . In particular:

(1) The tensor ideal ker π is strictly contained in N ,
(2) The quotient T /N has no triangulated structure such that the func-

tor T → T /N is triangulated.

Proof. Suppose we have a map f as in the statement. Then :

(1) By Proposition 1.4, N contains ker π. On the other hand, by con-

struction, f does not belong to ker π but it belongs to N ,

(2) If the quotient T /N was triangulated, then p(X) = p(X=0)⊕p(X=1)
and f would be a zero map which is the sum of two nonzero maps.
To construct such an f consider ﬁrst a nonzero map α : M → N in C,
such that End(M ) and End(N ) are of dimension 1 and there are no nonzero
map from N to M (which implies that α is in N ). This can be found by
taking M = 1, N to be the motivic H 1 of an elliptic curve without complex
multiplication and the map to be the diﬀerence of the origin and a point
which is not torsion.

Now consider the endomorphism of triangles

of two arrows are zero, then so is the third (this can be checked for example
after realization).

Proposition 6.4. Let X ∈ T be a motive. The ideal

{f : X → X, π(f ) = 0} ⊳ End(X)

is nilpotent. In particular the functor π is conservative.

Proof. By [AK02, 7.2.8] it is enough to show that there exists a positive inte-
ger NX (depending only on X) such that for all endomorphisms f : X → X
beloging to ker π one has f NX = 0.

We show this fact by induction on the length. When the length is zero this
is Proposition 3.2. For a higher length write an endomorphism of triangles

hence the square of f m vanishes. This means that NX = 2m suﬃces (and
note that it does depend only on X).

To deduce the conservativity of π, notice that, as π is triangulated, it is
enough to show that π(X) = 0 implies X = 0. But, π(X) = 0 implies that
idX is in the kernel of π, hence 0 = idNX
(cid:3)

X = idX .

Proposition 6.5. Suppose that the base ﬁeld k is not algebraic over a ﬁnite
ﬁeld. Then there exists an endomorphism f : X → X in T belonging to the
numerical ideal N but which is not nilpotent. Moreover, the functor p is not
conservative.

Proof. First consider a nonzero map α : M → N in C, such that End(M )
and End(N ) are of dimension 1 and there are no nonzero map from N to
M as in the proof of Proposition 6.3.

Now consider the endomorphism of triangles

We have to show that for any g : X → X we have tr(gf ) = 0.
By Theorem 4.1(10), such an endomorphism g is equivalent to a commu-

tative square

tr(cid:18)(cid:18)a 0

c′ d′(cid:19)(cid:18)0 0

0 1(cid:19)(cid:19) .

0

This implies tr(gf ) = 0 (as one can check after realization).

To show that p is not conservative consider h = f − id. As we have shown
that f belongs to N then p(h) is invertible. Now, if h was invertible, then
