We study the merger of binary neutron stars with diﬀerent mass ratios adopting three diﬀerent
realistic, microphysical nuclear equations of state, as well as incorporating neutrino cooling eﬀects.
In particular, we concentrate on the inﬂuence of the equation of state on the gravitational wave
signature and also on its role, in combination with neutrino cooling, in determining the properties
of the resulting hypermassive neutron star, of the neutrinos produced, and of the ejected material.
The ejecta we ﬁnd are consistent with other recent studies that ﬁnd that small mass ratios produce
more ejecta than equal mass cases (up to some limit) and this ejecta is more neutron rich. This trend
indicates the importance with future kilonovae observations of measuring the individual masses of an
associated binary neutron star system, presumably from concurrent gravitational wave observations,
in order to be able to extract information about the nuclear equation of state.

INTRODUCTION

The spectacular detection of gravitational waves in
event GW150914 [1] marks the start of the gravitational
wave astronomy era. While this ﬁrst direct detection cor-
responds to a signal produced by the merger of a bi-
nary black hole system, the existence of gravitational
waves and our ability to detect them have been dra-
matically demonstrated. This observation will surely in-
tensify eﬀorts to identify potential signals in the vari-
ous bands (gravitational wave, electromagnetic wave, and
even neutrinos for suﬃciently close events). An early ex-
ample of this tantalizing possibility is the possible—and
puzzling—connection of GW150914 with an observation
by Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
[2] (see
however [3, 4]). This new era of multimessenger astron-

omy will not only help test gravity and unravel spectac-
ular astrophysics events but, importantly, enhance the
detection possibilities themselves. The ﬂurry of activ-
ity prompted by GW150914 serves as a clear example of
what this era will bring. For instance, just to name a few
examples, this single GW observation has spurred eﬀorts
to: test the basic tenants of General Relativity (e.g. [5–
7]), infer astrophysical consequences on binary black hole
population (e.g. [8, 9]), discuss possible mechanisms to
explain the rather large stellar masses extracted from
the signal (e.g. [10, 11]), and re-examine how to possi-
bly channel electromagnetic counterparts in stellar mass
binary black holes (e.g. [12, 13]).

Among compact binary systems, binary neutron star
systems present very exciting prospects both in terms of
providing strong signals and for the underlying physics
able to be explored. For example, tidal eﬀects during the
late orbiting stages are imprinted on the gravitational
wave signal and the interaction of the stars with their sur-
rounding plasma can power pulsar-like electromagnetic
signals from radio to gamma ray wavelengths [14–16].
The merger of such a system produces a diﬀerentially ro-
tating, hot massive neutron star (MNS) with a strong
neutrino luminosity. Depending on the masses involved
and the EOS describing the stars, this massive remnant
may collapse to a black hole, allowing for signals to re-
veal the “birth cry” of a black hole [17]. Such a black
hole could lead to hyper-accretion and a short gamma-ray
burst (sGRB) or related phenomena. The merger itself
could produce signiﬁcant outﬂow such that the ejected
material might power a kilonova. A ﬁrst reported of
kilonova observation has been presented in [18, 19]. Fur-
thermore, binary neutron star systems are important to
test for alternative theories of gravity describing dynam-

ics that depart signiﬁcantly from the expected one in
General Relativity, even when binary black holes behave
precisely as in GR [20–22].
Interestingly, such depar-
tures might be diﬃcult to extract solely via gravitational
waves [23] and complementary electromagnetic informa-
tion will be important for such a task [24].

The dynamics and identiﬁcation of potential signals of
such a complicated system are complex, generally requir-
ing numerical simulation of dynamical gravity, magne-
tized plasma, matter described with a realistic EoS, and
ﬁnally the ability to track the dominant nuclear reactions
involving neutrinos. Here we present the results of our
latest studies of the merger of systems of two, unequal
mass, neutron stars.

Our results suggest that unequal mass binaries, rela-
tive to the equal mass case, produce more ejecta that is
cool and neutron rich because the ejecta has been tidally
ripped from the constituent stars. That this material is
neutron rich provides a likely environment for r-process
nucleosynthesis and may produce an afterglow consistent
with a kilonova. Additionally, a radio counterpart might
be produced as this material interacts with the inter-
stellar medium surrounding the binary. We provide es-
timates of the strength and time scales for such coun-
terparts. Contrary to the equal mass case, we note that
essentially all unequal mass cases studied produce enough
ejecta that is suﬃciently neutron rich for a related kilo-
nova to peak in the infrared. This indicates that indi-
vidual mass estimates through gravitational wave infor-
mation may be crucial to extract EoS information us-
ing kilonovae observations from generic binary neutron
star mergers We illustrate diﬃculties in obtaining EoS
information just from gravitational waveforms based on
a small number of events unless post-merger detection
and analysis is within reach. In such a case, if prompt
collapse to black hole does not take place, extraction of
the dominant gravitational wave mode produced by the
remnant can provide a clean connection with the neu-
tron star equation of state, and we present a simple ﬁt
connecting the (possibly) observable frequency with the
star’s characteristics. In addition, we estimate neutrino
luminosities and their dependence on EoS and mass ratio
and discuss possible features that can potentially provide
complementary information on the EoS. We summarize
details in section II, present results in section III, and
discuss these results in section IV.

II. NUMERICAL IMPLEMENTATION

The evolution equations for the spacetime and the ﬂuid
are already described in our previous paper[25], while
full details of our implementation are described in [26].
Unless otherwise speciﬁed, we adopt geometrized units
where G = c = M(cid:12) = 1, except for some particular
results which are reported more naturally in physical cgs
units.

Our stars consist of a ﬂuid described by the stress en-

2

ergy tensor

Tab = huaub + P gab ,

(1)
where h is the ﬂuid’s total enthalpy h ≡ ρ(1 + ) + P , and
{ρ, , Ye, ua, P} are the rest mass energy density, speciﬁc
internal energy, electron fraction (describing the relative
abundance of electrons compared to the total number of
baryons), four-velocity, and pressure of the ﬂuid, respec-
tively.

To track the composition of the ﬂuid and the emission
of neutrinos we employ a leakage scheme. In particular,
the equations of motion consist of the following conser-
vation laws

∇aT a

b = Gb ,
∇a(Tabnb) = 0 ,
∇a(Yeρua) = ρRY , .

(2)

(3)
(4)

The sources Ga (≡ −∇cRc
a) and RY correspond to the
radiation four-force density and lepton sources and are
computed within the leakage scheme. These equations
are conservation laws for the stress-energy tensor, mat-
ter, and lepton number, respectively. Notice that, in the
absence of lepton source terms (RY = 0), Eq. (4) pro-
vides a conservation law for leptons, and is similar to the
familiar baryon conservation law, i.e., Ye is a mass scalar.

III. RESULTS

We extend our previous work [25] and study the merger
of unequal mass neutron star binaries. In particular, we
concentrate on systems with parameters consistent with
current observations (see e.g. [27]). Therefore, we will
consider binaries with the same total gravitational mass
M = 2.70M(cid:12) and with diﬀerent mass ratios q ≡ M1/M2
between 1 (the equal mass case) and 0.76

We continue with the same three distinct microphysical
EoS (SFHo [28], DD2 [29] and NL3 [29]) used in our
previous paper [25]. These three EoS were chosen to span
a range of stiﬀnesses and they produce cold neutron stars
with radii ranging from ≈ 12 km with the SFHo soft EoS
to ≈ 15 km with the NL3 stiﬀ EoS (for the same mass of
1.35M(cid:12)). All three EoS are consistent with neutron stars
having a mass of at least 2 M(cid:12), and they are therefore
consistent with observations of NS masses [30, 31].

We focus here on the late stages of the coalescence,
comprising the last 4–6 orbits (depending on EoS), of
irrotational binary neutron star systems. The physical
parameters of the binaries and our grid setup are sum-
marized in Table I.

TABLE I: Summary of the binary neutron star systems considered in this work. The initial data were computed using the
Bin star solver from the Lorene package [32], with the assumption that the stars have an initial constant temperature of
T = 0.02 MeV and are in beta-equilibrium. All the binaries have a total mass M ADM
= 2.7M(cid:12) and start from an initial
separation of 45 km. The outer boundary is located at 750 km and the highest resolution covering both stars is ∆xmin = 230m.

in, for example, Ref. [33]). This approximation describes
the interaction via an expansion with respect to the pa-
rameter x ≡ (M ω)2/3 where M is the total mass and ω
is the orbital frequency. At the lowest order, x = M/R
with R the separation of the binary.

The amplitude of the gravitational waves produced, h
(and consequently the energy radiated and angular mo-
mentum loss), from the system are, to leading order,
given by the scaling h ∝ M5/3ω2/3/r. Here the chirp-
mass is deﬁned as M ≡ (m1m2)3/5/(m1 + m2)1/5 and
r is the distance to the source. Higher order contribu-
tions containing both conservative and dissipative pieces,
depending on the constituent masses, spin, radiation-
reaction, and internal structure, become increasingly
important as the frequency (separation) increases (de-
creases) (see e.g. [33]).

Particularly relevant for our current discussion are
tidal eﬀects and the eﬀect of mass ratio. For the for-
mer, given a mass ratio [87] q ≡ m1/m2, the chirp
mass is M = M q3/5/(1 + q)6/5 [which is also =

2−6/5M(cid:0)1 − 3δ2/20 + O(cid:0)δ3(cid:1)(cid:1) in terms of δ ≡ 1 − q] .

Thus the dominant contribution to the gravitational wave
amplitude is already sensitive to the mass ratio.
However, for realistic binary neutron star systems, the
parameter q is limited to a small range and 3δ2/20 (cid:39)
{0, 3 × 10−3, 9 × 10−3} for q = {1, 0.85, 0.76} thus mass
ratio diﬀerences in BNS systems are small.

Tidal eﬀects, on the other hand, can become quite sig-
niﬁcant at close separations, appearing with a high power
of the inverse of the stellar compaction.
In particular,
even though tidal eﬀects enter the PN approximation at
tenth order in x, this sub-leading eﬀect can still be appar-
ent at suﬃciently high frequencies since Ci ∈ (0.05− 0.2)
for neutron stars. That is, the leading contribution to
the tidal force on a single star is given by

where k(i)

is the quadrupolar tidal coupling Love num-

can be expressed via κT

tidal eﬀects can become important as κT
tice that for a ﬁxed given total mass, stiﬀer EoS (i.e., with
larger radii and smaller compactness) lead to larger κT

and therefore stronger tidal eﬀects. Similarly, unequal
mass cases also lead to slightly larger κT

ing tidal eﬀects. For low frequencies on the other hand,
2 x10 (cid:28) O(1), and only the mass ratio can introduce
κT
departures when comparing binaries with the same total
mass. However, these departures are necessarily small
for BNS systems.

The consequences of the above observations are clearly
illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2. Fig. 1 shows the (coordinate)
separation versus time for all EoS and mass ratios studied
while Fig. 2 displays the gravitational wave signals as
computed by the Newman-Penrose scalar Ψ4.

The times in Fig. 2 have been relabeled in terms of a
merger time. For each EoS, all mass ratios use the same
time. In particular, the merger time is the time at which,
for the q = 1 case, the two locations of density maxima
(the centers of the two stars) decreases below a thresh-
old distance (generally the sum of the two stellar radii),
corresponding to the stars making contact. Because the
signals in each panel of Fig. 2 share the same time, we
have included a vertical line to denote the time when
such contact occurs for the unequal mass cases. As can
be clearly appreciated in both ﬁgures, the early behavior
of all mass ratios within a given EoS (< 7 ms) agree.

However, as the orbit tightens tidal deformations in-
crease and aﬀect the dynamics of the system. Their ef-
fects manifest ﬁrst for binaries described by the NL3,
followed by the DD2, and ﬁnally the SFHo equations of
state. As expected from our discussion above, this suc-
cession is tied to the decreasing radii characterizing the
stars of each binary. For instance, Fig. 1 indicates that a
more rapid plunge takes place for stars with larger radii,
and, interestingly, within the same EoS the merger takes
place earlier as the mass ratio is decreased. This behav-
ior is apparent in the gravitational wave signatures in
which binaries with large stellar radii demonstrate diﬀer-
ences earlier than those binaries with smaller radii. Fur-
thermore, comparison within the same EoS reveals that,
as the mass ratio decreases, an earlier departure from a
simpler (chirping) sinusoidal wave arises as tidal eﬀects
become more important. This pre-merger behavior is es-
pecially clear for the NL3 case but is essentially negligible
for the softer EoS considered.
Additionally q (cid:54)= 1 cases also display a stronger l =
2, m = 1 component in the gravitational waves during
the late pre-merger and afterwards than the q = 1 case.
However, such modes are still at least a couple of orders
of magnitude weaker than the main l = 2, m = 2 sig-
nal displayed in Fig. 2. Nevertheless, they can strongly
seed a possible m = 1 instability after the merger whose
associated frequency would be lower than the one corre-
sponding to m = 2 modes [39, 40].

The post-merger behavior is governed by the properties
of the resulting hot, diﬀerentially rotating MNS (or hy-
permassive NS) which loses energy and angular momen-
tum via emission of neutrinos and gravitational waves.
Depending on the EoS and the total mass, the remnant
MNS may eventually collapse to a black hole or continue
as a rotating star. In cases that avoid prompt collapse
to a black hole [88], gravitational waves in this stage are
characterized by a few dominant modes with frequen-
cies intimately tied to the EoS. These dominant modes
arise are determined by the natural oscillation frequen-
cies of the star, by the details of the merger process itself,
and by the possible development of an m = 1 instability
if a rather long-lived MNS is possible. Naturally, these
modes are a potentially rich source of information about
the system (see for instance [41] and references within).
We scrutinize these modes more closely by computing
the Fourier transform of the primary Ψ4 gravitational
wave mode (l = 2 = m) in a time window of duration
roughly 10 ms after the merger. These spectra, shown
in Fig. 3, demonstrate several characteristic peaks, and
these peak frequencies are presented in Table II. The
most dominant of these modes, using the terminology
of Ref. [42], fpeak, is associated with the rotational be-
havior and quadrupolar structure of the newly formed
MNS/HMNS. Secondary modes, at lower frequencies,
can be associated with diﬀerent mechanisms [39, 42–44].
However as noted in [42], in low total mass binaries [45]
and for the case of a stiﬀ EoS as in Ref. [46], (the ma-
jority of) these secondary modes degrade quickly with

FIG. 1: The coordinate separation between the centers of the
stars as a function of time for diﬀerent mass ratios and EoS.
Overall, unequal mass binaries merge more quickly than equal
mass binaries, and the time to merger increases for softer

densities.

time in just a few milliseconds and are unlikely to build
enough SNR for detection. The primary mode on the
other hand, can last for long times and provide the best
opportunity for detection. Consequently it has been the
focus of increased scrutiny.

Recently, a ﬁt for these modes has been suggested for
the case of equal mass binaries [42], and we include in
Table II the frequencies predicted from this ﬁt together
with our measured values. As discussed in our previous
work [25], our results for q = 1 are within 10% of the
predicted frequencies.

A similar ﬁt for unequal mass binaries described by
tabulated EoS is so far unavailable because, contrary to
the equal mass case, studies with q (cid:54)= 1 are still in their
infancy. The majority of currently available results for
unequal mass binaries employ piece-wise polytropes (cho-
sen to be reasonable approximations to tabulated, real-
istic EoS.). A comparison of results obtained with the
so-called MS1, H4, SLy cases, studied in [47], which have
similar mass ratios and masses to those used here for the
NL3, DD2, SFHo EoS, reveals that the peak frequencies
agree to better than 5%. As well, Ref. [46] found that, for
the polytrope dubbed SLyPP (which yields a NS similar
to the one described by the NL3 EoS considered here),
the resulting peak frequency, fpeak, has a small depen-
dence on the mass ratio, with a slightly higher frequency
for the equal mass case. This ﬁnding is also consistent
with our results. Last, relatively small diﬀerences in the
peak frequency with respect to mass ratio have also been
reported in other recent works [37, 42, 48]. As can be
appreciated in Table II, we also ﬁnd that the peak fre-
quencies for q (cid:54)= 1 lie within ≈ 10% of the corresponding
q = 1 case and are typically lower —except for q = 0.85

This correlation is characterized by a correlation coef-
ﬁcient = 0.96 and has been obtained with total mass
M = 2.7M(cid:12). For systems with a diﬀerent total mass,
Eq. (8) eﬀectively rescales the contact frequency.

For instance, Ref.

[45] presented peak frequencies
from evolutions of equal mass binaries with total mass
M = 2.4M(cid:12) concentrating on three EoS: the same
DD2 and SFHo EoS studied here along with LS220 [50]
which yields radii in between the other two for the same
mass. The corresponding peak frequencies computed
for DD2, LS220, and SFHo EoS are 2.35 kHz, 2.56 kHz,
and 2.96 kHz, respectively. Expression (8) estimates the
peak frequencies to be fpeak = 2.32 kHz, 2.49 kHz, and
2.91 kHz, respectively, for these cases. The agreement
is quite good. It would be interesting to explore if this
simple approach works as well in the case of spinning
binaries (e.g. [39, 51]) and to contrast it to alternative
ﬁts depending explicitly on tidal deformability parame-
ters [52].

Finally, beyond the speciﬁc dynamics and waveform
characteristics, it is instructive to explore the extent to
which the obtained waveforms could be distinguished
with respect to diﬀerent conﬁgurations of aLIGO. To
do so, we ﬁrst obtain a longer wavetrain by employ-
ing at earlier times a PN (Taylor T4) expansion aug-
mented to include leading order tidal eﬀects as described
in Refs. [34, 53]. We match this augmented PN signal at
early times to our numerical signal before merger to form
a hybrid waveform. (Further improvements in the early
signal can be achieved, see e.g. [52, 54], though such im-
provements would not aﬀect the main conclusions drawn
here.) The matching is accomplished by choosing a cycle
devoid of the initial numerical transients but still well be-

FIG. 2: A comparison of the gravitational wave signals near
merger using the primary mode of Ψ4. The signals have been
shifted in time such that t = 0 corresponds to the moment of
contact for q = 1, with respect to each EoS, and vertical bars
indicate the moment of contact for the other cases [the time
labels are the same in all panels]. For NL3 and to a lesser
extent for DD2, clear diﬀerences in the waveforms arise prior
to the stars coming into contact. In contrast, the SFHo wave-
forms show essentially no diﬀerences before merger. After the

of the waveforms, showing that they carry information about
the post-merger star, e.g., internal structure, radius, compact-
ness, etc., that is sensitive to the equation of state.

DD2.

Beyond comparing with particular ﬁts, it is instructive
to take a step back and consider estimating the peak fre-
quency based on simple arguments which can shed light
on the underlying physics of the system. A simple ap-
proach is to consider the contact frequencies, fc, of the
binary, based on the radii of the two stars. This approach
can only provide a lower bound but it may potentially
lead to improved estimates in the future. The contact
frequency [89] is given in terms of the binary parameters

We include with our measured frequencies the estimated

lower than the observed frequencies as anticipated, they
do provide a consistent trend.

SRM”’ noise curves in aLIGO [59]. Table III lists the

values obtained for δh ≡(cid:112)(hi − hj, hi − hj) (without al-

lowing for frequency shifts and without normalizing our
waveforms). Values above 1 imply such waveforms could
be distinguished, indicating therefore that DD2 wave-
forms for q = 0.76 could be distinguished from all the
others when using the more aggressive noise curve. The
other cases are not discernible, even when using the Zero
Detuned, High Power noise curve.

The delicate nature of distinguishing EoS eﬀects in
binary neutron star systems has been thoroughly dis-
cussed in Refs. [60, 61], which stressed the need for tens
of events to disentangling EoS diﬀerences if employing
gravitational waves alone. Importantly, as discussed in,
e.g. [25, 62–66] and later in this work, complementary
electromagnetic information can help reveal the EoS from
the characteristics of the radioactive decay of heavy ele-
ments produced by ejected material.

B. Matter dynamics: Outﬂow and Ejecta

The merger of a binary with the total mass consid-
ered here produces a hot, rotating neutron star that is

two waveforms is calculated using a tanh function that
transitions from 0 to 1.

Fig. 5 illustrates the strain of the waveforms for the
diﬀerent cases considered here with respect to two pos-
sible noise curves from aLIGO for binaries at 100 Mpc.
As can be appreciated in the ﬁgure, essentially no diﬀer-
ences exist that could be discerned with the “No SRM”
noise curve with a single event at such a distance. The
more aggressive noise curve corresponding to the “Zero
Detuned, High Power” conﬁguration would, however, be
sensitive to diﬀerences between the stiﬀest and softest
EoS considered.

As a ﬁgure of merit, it is instructive to contrast the dis-
tinguishability of the obtained waveforms. Since we start
all our simulations at the same separation (orbital fre-
quency) we compute the “distinguishability” between the
diﬀerent waveforms (as described in e.g. [55], see also [56–

sented here beneﬁt from an improvement to our code’s
treatment of the atmosphere so that the ﬂoor value de-
creases rapidly with distance from the center of coordi-
nates (similar to that used in [75]). Comparisons of the
new atmosphere treatment with the original, as well as
studies with diﬀerent atmosphere values, indicates that
the properties being presented are nearly-independent of
this improvement when the atmosphere density is suﬃ-
ciently small ≈ 5× 105 g/cm3 ≈ 10−10ρmax and when es-
timates are calculated shortly after merger of ≤ 4− 5 ms.

stable for some time against gravitational collapse to
a black hole due to the rapid diﬀerential rotation and
the thermal pressure. The merger that produces such
a star is quite violent and, as a by product, a signiﬁ-
cant amount of material can be ejected from the binary.
The characteristics of this ejecta is important as it can
produce an associated electromagnetic signal [67–69] that
can provide complementary information about the binary
(e.g. [25, 45, 70, 71]).

The recent observation of an infrared transient asso-
ciated associated with the SGRB 130603B [18, 19] has
demonstrated that such a tantalizing prospect is within
reach. Additionally as discussed in [72], bound mat-
ter might also induce observable electromagnetic sig-
nals through the properties of winds emitted by the sys-
tem [72–74].

We thus concentrate here on describing the proper-
ties of outﬂow material and its dependence on both the
nuclear EoS and the binary mass ratio. The latter is
particularly relevant as this material generally originates
via tidal eﬀects and is therefore especially sensitive to
the mass ratio. We analyze in detail the various binaries
at ∼3 ms after merger. A key distinction is made be-
tween matter remaining bound to the system and ejecta,
i.e. material having kinetic energy suﬃcient to unbind it.
Our analysis uses the common approach that material is
considered unbound if its energy (deﬁned by assuming
that the spacetime is stationary) is positive.

We note that an important issue when studying low-
density material
in simulations adopting conservative
“Eulerian” schemes (as opposed to Lagrangian schemes)
is that the results in low density regions could be sig-
niﬁcantly aﬀected by the artiﬁcial atmosphere employed

FIG. 6: Density, temperature, electron fraction, and neutrino
luminosity rate for the diﬀerent EoS on the z = 0 plane at
roughly t = 3 ms after the merger. Shown are the NL3 EoS
(left), DD2 EoS (middle), and SFHo (right) for the mass ratio
q = 0.85.

We begin by considering all three EoS for the same
mass ratio, q = 0.85. Fig. 6 displays various properties
along the equatorial plane (z = 0), all roughly 3 millisec-
onds after merger. The density variations are similar to
that seen in the equal mass case (see Figure 9 of [25]); the
SFHo remnant is more centrally condensed compared to
the remnants of the stiﬀer EoS that are less compact.
Such behavior is expected as the collision takes place
deeper in the gravitational potential of the system which,
in turn, implies the remnant of the SFHo case is hotter
than the other two. Also, while all three snapshots with
diﬀerent EoS show wisps of electron rich material just
outside the remnants, the SFHo has the most signiﬁcant
of such regions. This is due to the larger matter temper-
atures in the SFHo remnant that drives decompression

the temperature in Fig. 9, the velocity in Fig. 10 and the
polar and azimuthal angles in Fig. 11. Using these his-
tograms, we present some observations and follow these
with a general discussion about these features.

Quite apparent in Fig. 8 is that bound material is gen-
erally quite neutron rich and independent of the mass ra-
tio. However, the temperature distribution of this bound
material does show some dependence on the mass ratio
in Fig. 9. For the NL3 case, the dependence is minimal
with the temperature distribution remaining generally
the same among the mass ratios. The SFHo case shows
the largest variation with mass ratio with the smaller
mass ratio yielding a generally cooler merger remnant.

The ejecta, on the other hand, becomes increasingly
neutron rich as the mass ratio departs from unity. Also
apparent (in the insets) is that the amount of unbound
material generally increases when the mass ratio de-
creases. We quantitatively summarize the amount of
ejecta mass in Table I. The NL3 ejecta for the equal mass
case is minuscule but signiﬁcant for q = 0.85. The DD2
ejecta increases much less dramatically, but the SFHo
breaks with this trend, albeit only moderately. The tem-
perature of the ejecta is quite cool (< 5 MeV) for every
EoS and mass ratio, as displayed in Fig. 9. The observed
trend indicates that for lower values of q the ejected ma-
terial is cooler, being dominated by neutron-rich, tidal
tail material.

Another interesting observation comes from the angu-
lar distribution of the ejected material. Fig. 11 shows
the azimuthal and polar angle distributions of unbound
material. The histograms of polar angle do not show
signiﬁcant qualitative diﬀerences between the diﬀerent
mass ratio cases other than one observed trend. For low
mass ratios the ejecta is more conﬁned towards the equa-
torial region, giving quantitatively steeper distributions.
The azimuthal distribution is more isotropic in the equal
mass case (two spiral arms) but more anisotropic in the
unequal mass cases (one spiral arm). As expected, the
anisotropy grows as the mass ratio decreases from unity.
These observations suggest that a smaller mass ratio
results in a less violent collision because the less massive
star disrupts earlier and further out of the gravitational
well than in the equal mass case. Only the NL3 bound
material has essentially the same temperature for the dif-
ferent mass ratios. This EoS, however, has the largest
stars generally, and so its equal mass case is already fairly
cool. In contrast, the SFHo case has noticeably cooler
bound and ejected material.

In general terms, the unbound matter (or ejecta) can
be sourced either by tidal disruption during the merger
or by thermal pressure and other interactions (e.g. shock
heating) [On longer timescales –not studied here– an ex-
tra source is provided by winds or outﬂows from an accre-
tion disk [73]]. Our work here concentrates mainly on the
material produced by tidal interaction, and we observe
that, as the mass ratio decreases, the tidal disruption oc-
curs earlier and further out. Consequently, there is more
tidal-ejecta mass for small mass ratios. Furthermore,

FIG. 7: Density, temperature, electron fraction, and neutrino
luminosity rate for the DD2 EoS on the z = 0 plane at roughly
t = 3 ms after the merger. Shown are the three mass ratios

of the hot material to lower densities where positron cap-
ture on neutrons can eﬀectively raise the electron frac-
tion. For all the EoS, there is evidence of tidal tails with
one spiral arm stronger than the other. This asymmetry
arises from the unequal mass ratio of the binary.

To more cleanly understand the role of mass ratio, we
ﬁx the EoS to that with the intermediate stiﬀness, DD2,
and consider three mass ratios. Fig. 7 displays the same
quantities as in Fig. 6 but instead for mass ratios q =
{1, 0.85, 0.76}.

The density panels show that a decreased mass ratio
results in a similar looking remnant but with more dis-
persed material outside it due to stronger tidal eﬀects.
The temperature looks roughly similar in the star, al-
though slightly higher in the tidal tails of the equal mass
cases. The electron fraction is noticeably lower in the
decreased mass ratio simulations as is the neutrino emis-
sivity. All the quantities display a strong spiral arm in
the case of unequal masses, in contrast to the two spiral
arms of the equal mass case. As we discuss later how-
ever, these broad properties do not convey what portion
of this material is bound/unbound which is important in
determining possible kilonova characteristics.

To this end, we integrate the characteristics of both
the bound and the unbound matter and plot them as
histograms (such calculations are described in Ref. [25]).
In particular, we display the electron fraction in Fig. 8,

the temperature of this ejecta is lower, which inhibits
positron production and capture on neutrons. Thus, the
electron fraction is much closer to that of the original
neutron star material. Only the SFHo retains essentially
the same amount of ejected material with changes to the
mass ratio because of a presumed balance of a compet-
ing eﬀect; namely that the equal mass case was quite vio-
lent resulting in signiﬁcant interaction ejecta (with higher
values of Ye and T ) from shock heating. In the unequal
mass case, the violence decreases (decreasing the interac-
tion ejecta), but the early disruption increases the tidal
ejecta. This explanation is consistent with the tempera-
ture and Ye distributions of ejecta mass discussed above
and shown in Figs. 8 and 9.

The current work is so far the only one of which we are
aware studying unequal binaries employing realistic mi-
crophysical EoS; thus there is a lack of studies with which
to compare, for instance, the amount of ejected material.
As we did for the case of gravitational wave characteris-
tics, we can compare our results to those obtained em-
ploying piecewise polytropic EoS. To do so we focus on
cases studied using the so-called MS1, H4, SLy piece-wise
polytropes from [37] which have similar mass ratios and
masses to those used here for the NL3, DD2, SFHo EoS.
The results are in reasonable agreement with some of
the cases, with typical ejected masses of 10−4 − 10−3M(cid:12)
(although they ﬁnd even 10−2M(cid:12) for their softest EoS
[SLy]). It is not clear if these diﬀerences come only from
the EoS choice. Nevertheless the overall trend is the
same, namely that a) softer EoS have larger ejecta and
b) unequal mass cases, for a given EoS, have larger ejecta
masses for stiﬀ EoS (DD2 and NL3 in our case, MS1 and
H4 in the case of [37]) and lower ejecta masses for soft
EoS (SFHo in our case, SLy in [37]).

The ejecta values obtained here allow us to estimate
the lag-times (with respect to merger) and luminosities
corresponding to each case. An important property of
ejecta with such a low value of Ye is its ability to produce
elements with high atomic mass number (A ≥ 120) [76–
78]. As argued in [79], due to the increased opacity as a
result of lanthanides contributions, the expected emission
from thermal decay of r-process elements would be dim-
mer/redder and delayed with respect to typical super-
nova expectations. Estimates in [79] (slightly re-arranged
as in [39]) argue that the rise time of the corresponding
kilonova emission tk

given by

In addition to the electromagnetic signals produced by
the decay of radioactive elements, another transient has
been proposed as a result from the collision of the ejected
material with the interstellar medium [80]. This interac-
tion would produce a radio emission that evolves more
slowly. Indeed, the estimated timescales and brightness
are expected to obey [80] (employing the re-arranged ver-
sion of [39])

energy minus the rest mass and the internal energies [75].

C. Neutrino Emission

Finally we turn our attention to the neutrinos emitted
by the system. We estimate the luminosity via a leak-
age scheme [81–83] and determine the thermodynamic
properties of the neutrinospheres via a ray-tracing for-
malism [84]. The algorithms we employ to obtain both
estimates have been described in our previous papers [26]
and [25], respectively.

Figs. 6 and 7 illustrate both the spatial extent of the
temperature and of the neutrino emissivities in the equa-
torial plane at ∼3 ms after merger for the q = 0.85 mass
ratio simulations across all EoS (NL3, DD2, SFHo), and
for the DD2 EoS simulations across the three mass ra-
tios considered (q = 1.0, 0.85, and 0.76), respectively.
The ﬁrst ﬁgure indicates that softer EoS will give rise
to higher neutrino luminosities which is consistent with
observations in the equal mass case [25]. The higher lu-
minosities are natural consequences of both the increased
temperature and the increased amount of shock heating
for the softer EoS. The higher temperatures also imply
that the neutrino average energies will be higher.

These observations and conclusions are also supported
by the results of our ray-tracing shown in Fig. 12. This
ﬁgure shows the spatial distribution of the temperature
of the electron neutrinosphere and electron antineutri-
nosphere for the q = 0.85 mass ratio simulations us-
ing three diﬀerent EoS at ∼3 ms after merger. They
show higher peak matter temperatures at the electron
(anti)neutrinosphere for the SFHo EoS, locally as high
as ∼16 MeV (∼18 MeV), when compared to the NL3 EoS

peak and luminosity L of EM
radiation from a potential kilonova are calculated from Eqs. (9) and (10). We used the middle value of the bin corresponding
to the peak velocity (see Fig 10), v/c, in calculating these estimates. The lag time tpeak and ﬂux density F , estimated from
the collision of the ejecta with the interstellar medium, are calculated from Eqs. (11) and (12).

where the peak temperatures at the (anti)neutrinosphere
reach ∼12 MeV (∼14 MeV). Our ray-tracing gives aver-
age electron neutrino (antineutrino) energies (as mea-
sured at inﬁnity) for these same snapshots of ∼12.6 MeV
(∼15.6 MeV), ∼15.1 MeV (∼18.1 MeV), and ∼15.3 MeV
(∼17.8 MeV), for the NL3, DD2, and SFHo EoS, respec-
tively. These average energies are also summarized in
Table V.

We next consider the impact of the mass ratio on the

properties of the emitted neutrinos. Fig. 13 shows the
neutrino surfaces ∼3 ms after merger for the three mass
ratios considered for the DD2 EoS. The maximum tem-
peratures achieved at the neutrinospheres are ∼14 MeV
and correspond to the equal mass case. These maximum
temperatures decrease to ∼12 MeV for the smaller mass
ratios. As q decreases, the matter distribution becomes
more dispersed, a consequence of stronger tidal eﬀects,
and this eﬀect is reﬂected in more dispersed neutrino
surfaces that, in addition to reaching smaller maximum
temperatures, display a more uniform temperature. This

more dispersed, but uniform, behavior can also be seen
close to the core in the equatorial slices of Fig. 7. Our
neutrino analysis shows that for the NL3 EoS there is a
drop of ∼2–3 MeV in the average neutrino energy emit-
ted from the merger remnants when the mass ratio goes
from q = 1 to q = 0.85. For the DD2 EoS, no signiﬁcant
change or trend is seen in the neutrino average energies
for these three particular snapshots.

The impact of the mass ratio on the neutrino emis-
sion properties of the post merger evolution appears to
be stronger for the SFHo EoS simulations. Recall the ob-
servation in the temperature and Ye distributions (Figs. 9
and 8) of the ejected mass and bound mass from the pre-
vious section. For the soft SFHo EoS, when comparing
the q = 1 to the q = 0.85 mass ratio simulation, we saw
a transition from shock heated–or interaction–ejecta to
tidal ejecta and overall lower temperatures. Our neutrino
analysis suggests that this transition has a direct and
signiﬁcant impact on the neutrino quantities; we observe
signiﬁcantly lower average neutrino energies (∼6-8 MeV;
see Table V) and consequently predict a lower rate of
neutrino detection for close by mergers. This analysis
would indicate that observations of a few systems with
diﬀerent values of q (extracted from gravitational wave
measurements of the individual NS masses) could hint at
properties of the underlying EoS (see e.g. [85]).

We caution however that these observation are drawn

from a detailed analysis at particular moments of time
after merger in diﬀerent simulations. These disks are
highly perturbed and are undergoing rapid changes. It
is important to explore this possibility more fully in the
future by employing actual neutrino transport in order
to obtain a better handle on the neutrino energy and

energies (cid:104)E¯νe(cid:105) and (cid:104)Eνe(cid:105) are computed with (without) the

from our ray-tracing to estimate detection rates in a
SuperKamiokande-like water-Cherenkov detector. These
numbers are summarized in Table V. In addition to the
three q = 0.85 mass ratio simulations, we also include in
the table the results from the q = 1 simulations (with
all three EoS) and the q = 0.76 simulation performed
with the DD2 EoS. We note that the change in deﬁni-
tion of merger time between this work and that of [25]
causes slight diﬀerences in the value of t for the q = 1
snapshots [90]. To estimate the neutrino detection rates
presented in Table V, we have made use of the following

where L¯νe and (cid:104)E¯νe(cid:105) are the electron antineutrino lu-
minosity and average energy as listed in Table V. The
details of this expression and the tracing technique are
discussed in [25]. Our calculations suggest that discrim-
inating the mass ratio based on neutrino detection alone
is unlikely. However such a detection, especially if coin-
cident or correlated with GWs, could shed light on the
dynamics of stellar material near, and soon after, the
point of merger.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

This work furthers our studies of the rich phenomenol-
ogy of binary mergers, concentrating on unequal mass
neutron star binaries with realistic equations of state and
neutrino cooling. We focused on gravitational wave char-
acteristics, ejecta and neutrino emission from the system
and, in particular, identiﬁed features that can help ex-

FIG. 13: Electron neutrino (top) and electron antineutrino
(bottom) surfaces as seen from the z-axis for the DD2 EoS
and diﬀerent mass ratios q at t = 3 ms after the merger.

We end our discussion of the neutrino properties of the
merger remnants by exploring the evolution of the neu-
trino luminosity. Fig. 14 shows the total neutrino lumi-
nosity as a function of time for all cases considered. Since
neutrino production is strongly dependent on the tem-
peratures achieved during and after the merger, a higher
emission is expected as the EoS softens. Our simulations
follow this trend (note the diﬀerent scales in Fig. 14 for
the diﬀerent EoS).

As discussed throughout this paper, the merger yields
a less violent collision for a given EoS as the mass ra-
tio is decreased. This observation is also apparent in the
neutrino luminosities. The equal mass cases show vari-
ous episodes of higher neutrino luminosity (and neutrino
average energy; see Table V) tied to the decompression
stage that follows both the bounce (i.e.
intensity max-
ima) and the occurrence of periods with higher relative
intensity in gravitational waves. Our results suggest that
unequal mass cases display a less oscillatory total neu-
trino luminosity. Although our sampling frequency of the
this luminosity is less than it was for the equal mass cases,
we see no suggestions of the quite apparent oscillations of
the q=1 cases. Furthermore, physically one would natu-
rally expect that the oscillations would be more apparent
in the symmetric, equal mass case as the bar-like remnant
oscillated about a centrally condensed state. Once again,
we stress the importance of a more detailed computation
including neutrino transport to conﬁrm the conclusions
reached here.

The very rare observation of neutrinos from a close-
by (galactic) neutron star merger would greatly com-
plement the GW signature and reveal important infor-
mation regarding the nuclear EoS. In combination with
the electron antineutrino luminosities from our leak-
age scheme, we can use the average energies computed

nuclear EoS. We studied the potential for equal mass bi-
naries to produce a kilonova in recent work [25] ﬁnding
the necessary conditions only for the softest EoS stud-
ied. However, as the mass ratio q decreases, we ﬁnd
that all three EoS considered produce signiﬁcant ejecta
with high neutron richness capable of producing a kilo-
nova that peaks in the infrared (due to the production of
heavy elements A > 120). For maximum eﬀect therefore,
electromagnetic observations of kilonovae afterglows from
BNS need to be combined with gravitational wave mea-
surements of the individual stellar masses. Neutrinos are
also produced copiously by the merger and their energies
appear to depend more strongly with the mass ratio for
softer EoS, though further studies are required to con-
ﬁrm and quantify this possibility. Provided the merger
occurs close enough to detect any neutrinos, their obser-
vation will provide valuable information on the EoS and
complement the gravitational wave signature.

With the recent opening of the gravitational wave win-
dow, observing compact binary mergers through gravita-
tional waves has become a reality. The combination of
this new information with that enabled by electromag-
netic signals and astroparticles will enable a deep under-
standing of such systems.

tract the nuclear EoS from observations. As discussed,
this information is encoded in observable signatures of
gravity waves, electromagnetic radiation, and neutrinos,
but extracting this information with a detection in only
one of these channels might prove quite diﬃcult. How-
ever, now that we have entered the era of GW detections,
the possibility of collecting multiple merger events in dif-
ferent bands oﬀers the promise of a deep understanding
of the dynamics and EoS of these BNS systems.

Recent studies of BNS mergers have shown that the
dominant frequencies of the post-merger GW signals re-
veal details of the EoS. However, the region of highest
sensitivity for current GW detectors does not extend up
to these merger frequencies, which limits our ability to
extract EoS characteristics due to tidal eﬀects. Before
merger, tidal eﬀects only become signiﬁcant at the close
separations achieved just before merger, and, again, these
frequencies are generally higher than the most sensitive
bandwidth of GW detectors.

We have found that the peak frequency in the gravi-
tational waveform can be estimated via a ﬁt based on a
straightforward contact-frequency criteria which, in turn,
relates directly to the EoS by the stellar radii.
If the
merger results in a kilonova, the resulting electromag-
netic counterpart encodes more information about the

[87] We adopt the convention m2 ≥ m1 so that q ≤ 1.
[88] Remnants with total mass not signiﬁcantly larger than
the maximum allowed mass for a rotating neutron star
for a given EOS can avoid prompt collapse, e.g [86].

[89] As a certain amount of compression results in the

collision, the true gravitational frequency is naturally
higher.

[90] In Ref. [25], the merger time used for the neutrino

calculations measured time with respect to a merger
time calculated via the peak GW amplitude instead of
the time of ﬁrst contact.
