ABSTRACT

The Universe’s largest galaxy clusters likely built the majority of their massive >1011 M(cid:12) galaxies
in simultaneous, short-lived bursts of activity well before virialization. This conclusion is reached
from emerging datasets on z > 2 proto-clusters and the characteristics of their member galaxies,
in particular, rare starbursts and ultraluminous active galactic nuclei (AGN). The most challenging
observational hurdle in identifying such structures is their very large volumes, ∼104 comoving Mpc3 at
z > 2, subtending areas ∼half a degree on the sky. Thus the contrast aﬀorded by an overabundance of
very rare galaxies in comparison to the background can more easily distinguish overdense structures
from the surrounding, normal density ﬁeld. Five 2 <∼ z <∼ 3 proto-clusters from the literature are
discussed in detail and are found to contain up to 12 dusty starbursts or luminous AGN galaxies each, a
phenomenon that is unlikely to occur by chance even in overdense environments. These are contrasted
with three higher-redshift (4 <∼ z <∼ 5.5) dusty star-forming galaxy (DSFG) groups, whose evolutionary
fate is less clear. Measurements of DSFGs’ gas depletion times suggest that they are indeed short-lived
on ∼100 Myr timescales, and accordingly the probability of ﬁnding a structure containing more than
8 such systems is ∼0.2%, unless their ‘triggering’ is correlated on very large spatial scales, ∼10 Mpc
across. The volume density of DSFG-rich proto-clusters is found to be comparable to all >1015 M(cid:12)
galaxy clusters in the nearby Universe, a factor of ﬁve larger than expected in some simulations. Some
tension yet exists between measurements of the volume density of DSFG-rich proto-clusters and the
expectation that they are generated via short-lived episodes, as the latter suggests only a fraction
(< 1
2 ) of all proto-clusters should be rich with DSFGs. However, improved observations of proto-
clusters over large regions of sky will certainly shed more light on the assembly of galaxy clusters, and
whether or not they build their galaxies through episodic bursts as suggested here.

INTRODUCTION

The environmental dependence of galaxies’ evolution is
observationally elusive. Locally, it is clear that galaxies
residing in the most massive environments exhibit char-
acteristics markedly diﬀerent from their counterparts in
the ﬁeld: they are more massive (e.g. Collins et al. 2009;
van der Burg et al. 2013), they are forming relatively
few stars (Balogh et al. 1998; Lewis et al. 2002), they are
preferentially red (Wake et al. 2005), and they lack spiral
structure (Skibba et al. 2009). At their cores, hot inter-
cluster gas−containing ∼90% of the cluster’s baryonic
matter−renders these massive systems easy to detect via
their emission of Bremsstrahlung radiation in the X-ray
(see review of Kravtsov & Borgani 2012). These threads
of observational evidence, combined with knowledge of
density ﬂuctuations in the early Universe imprinted on
the Cosmic Microwave Background (Sheth, Mo & Tor-
men 2001), have formed the backbone of our understand-
ing of hierarchical growth in galaxy formation (Springel
2005; Vogelsberger et al. 2014). Higher density environ-
ments saw accelerated evolution by forming most of their
galaxies early and coalescing at earlier times. What does
this imply for observations of overdense environments at
high-redshift?

In line with hierarchical expectation, some works have
observed a reversal of the star-formation-density relation
at z ∼ 1 (Elbaz et al. 2007; Cooper et al. 2008), whereby

cmcasey@astro.as.utexas.edu

galaxies in overdense environments at high-redshift are
more likely to be star-forming than ﬁeld galaxies or
similar-mass galaxies in overdensities in the local Uni-
verse. However, several other works do not see this re-
versal (Patel et al. 2009; Cucciati et al. 2010; Bolzonella
et al. 2010; Scoville et al. 2013), leading to some uncer-
tainty in the processes driving evolution of clusters at
early times.

Observations of clusters in the early Universe (z > 1)
themselves also have considerable potential as tools for
testing galaxy formation theory in a cosmological con-
text and placing independent constraints on fundamen-
tal cosmological parameters. For example, discovering
a single cluster of suﬃcient mass at z ≥ 2 (Mhalo ∼
5× 1014 M(cid:12)) can place signiﬁcant constraints on current
cosmological models (e.g. Harrison & Coles 2012), just
as the discovery of a population of early massive galax-
ies may already challenge that paradigm (Steinhardt et
al. 2015). Hence, several observational eﬀorts to identify
high-redshift overdensities have been pursued over the
past few decades (Subramanian & Swarup 1992; Steidel
et al. 1998, 2005; Ivison et al. 2000; Stevens et al. 2003;
Miley et al. 2004; Doherty et al. 2010; Noble et al. 2013;
Rigby et al. 2014; Clements et al. 2014; Planck Collabo-
ration et al. 2015).

Unfortunately, detecting galaxy clusters at z > 2 has
proved especially challenging. While X-ray searches are
eﬃcient at selecting massive clusters through emission of
hot gas at z <∼ 1.5 (e.g. Rosati, Borgani & Norman 2002),

2

C. M. Casey

the rapid surface brightness dimming of X-ray emission
makes it an ineﬃcient observable at high-redshift. Other
techniques for identifying cluster environments are sim-
ilarly limited to z <∼ 2, such as optical searches for the
galaxy red sequence, which demonstrates the presence
of an evolved galaxy population (Gladders & Yee 2000;
Brodwin et al. 2007; Eisenhardt et al. 2008; Andreon
et al. 2014; Newman et al. 2014), and identiﬁcations
made using the Sunyaev-Zel’dovich eﬀect (Menanteau &
Hughes 2009; Vanderlinde et al. 2010; Planck Collabora-
tion et al. 2013). In addition to the diﬃculty in making
these observations at high-redshift, it is perhaps not sur-
prising that these methods struggle since they are opti-
mized to detect evolved clusters with older (red, massive,
elliptical) galaxy populations or the signature of a hot
inter-cluster medium (ICM). At suﬃciently early times,
cluster environments may not have yet virialized to the
point where the ICM heats, implying that detection in
the X-rays or S-Z are not optimal techniques, even if the
sensitivity were substantially deep to reach overdensities
at those epochs.

Despite the diﬃculty in identifying clusters at high-
redshift, about twenty overdensities have been obser-
vationally identiﬁed and spectroscopically conﬁrmed at
z > 2. The primary identiﬁcation technique has been
targeted narrow-band ﬁlter searches around single rare
galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts (e.g. Venemans et
al. 2007). These narrow band imaging campaigns fo-
cus on detection of Lyα (Lyman-α emitters, LAEs, Shi-
masaku et al. 2003; Palunas et al. 2004; Venemans et
al. 2002, 2005; Kuiper et al. 2011) or Hα (Hα emitters,
HAEs, Doherty et al. 2010; Hatch et al. 2011; Tanaka
et al. 2011; Hayashi et al. 2012; Koyama et al. 2013)
at the redshift of the quasar or radio galaxy. Typically
an excess of candidate emission line galaxies is found in
the vicinity of the targeted rare source when compared
against the ﬁeld. While this constitutes strong evidence
for highly clustered overdensities, most of the emission
line sources lack full spectral information or multiwave-
length characterization.

In contrast, some overdensities have been serendip-
itously found through large spectroscopic campaigns
(Steidel et al. 1998, 2005). Though rare, these constitute
the most spectroscopically complete proto-clusters, some
with over 100 identiﬁed LBGs or LAE member galaxies
extending several Mpc on a side. A further handful of
proto-clusters with 5–40 LBG members have been iden-
tiﬁed surrounding single bright submillimeter galaxies,
or dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs, at z = 2 − 5.3
Chapman et al. 2009; Carilli et al. 2011; Capak et al.
2011; Walter et al. 2012; Casey et al. 2015).

While the range of high-z overdensities are diverse,
this paper focuses only on those that are spectroscopi-
cally conﬁrmed with an excess of DSFGs and luminous
AGN. These structures are of particular interest as they
provide unique testbeds for understanding the assembly
history of massive clusters by virtue of the presumed rar-
ity and short lifetimes of their constituents (Solomon &
Sage 1988; Bothwell et al. 2013; Carilli & Walter 2013;
Martini 2004). § 2 presents the observational characteris-
tics of these DSFG/AGN-rich structures. Their potential
to collapse into some of the Universe’s most massive clus-
ters is addressed in § 3, and their unique constraints on
galaxy cluster assembly is discussed in § 4. Predictions

are made for the next generation of large observational
surveys and large-box simulations in § 5, with conclu-
sions given in § 6. Throughout, a Λ CDM cosmology is
assumed with H0=71 km s−1 Mpc−1 and Ωm=0.27 (Hin-
shaw et al. 2009), and comoving Mpc is denoted through-
out as cMpc to distinguish from proper Mpc.

2. DSFG/AGN-RICH PROTO-CLUSTERS

Here I present the existing observational characteris-
tics for overdense structures at z >∼ 2 with robust spec-
troscopic redshifts and an overabundance of DSFGs or
luminous AGN. The importance of an overabundance of
DSFGs or luminous AGN is key: these are types of galax-
ies that are >∼ 100 times more rare than most ‘normal’
L(cid:63) galaxies across all epochs. Their rarity is what makes
them useful for studying high-redshift overdensities, not
only because they represent a potentially critical evolu-
tionary stage for early massive galaxy formation (Toft
et al. 2014), but also because a group of them in close
proximity is exceedingly rare and can easily identify an
overdense structure too large to be identiﬁed through
more common galaxy populations. Furthermore, as will
be discussed in later sections, they can place unique con-
straints on the assembly history of proto-clusters.

Their star-formation rates, dark matter halo masses,
structure volumes, and respective population overden-
sities are estimated below and discussed in context of
each proto-cluster’s observations. The star-formation
rates are computed with careful treatment of individ-
ual dust-obscured starbursts, which will dominate the
calculation of SFR, as well as a rough constraint on
the contribution from other optically-selected members
like LBGs. Dark matter halo masses are estimated us-
ing abundance matching techniques (Behroozi, Wechsler
& Conroy 2013), requiring estimates to each individual
member’s stellar mass, unless stated otherwise. Due to
shear numbers, the halo mass is dominated by optically-
identiﬁed member galaxies. Third, any available infor-
mation on the physical extent of the structure is sum-
marized, e.g.
its occupied volume, although the uncer-
tainty of such an estimation should be emphasized. Due
to spectroscopic incompleteness, all of these estimates
may be viewed as lower limits in physical terms, but can
be regarded as representative of existing observable con-
straints.
Galaxy overdensities are quantiﬁed with the measure-
ment of δgal = (Ngal − Nexp)/Nexp, where Ngal is the
observed number of member galaxies and Nexp is the ex-
pected number of galaxies in the same volume of blank
ﬁeld, or expected cosmic density. The expected number
of galaxies is determined using known luminosity func-
tions for ‘normal’ galaxies like LBGs (e.g. Reddy & Stei-
del 2009; van der Burg, Hildebrandt & Erben 2010), X-
ray AGN (Silverman et al. 2008) and DSFGs (Casey,
Narayanan & Cooray 2014). Diﬀerent survey depths of
diﬀerent ﬁelds are taken into account in determining how
prevalent a given population may be. The observational
characteristics of all proto-clusters, as discussed in this
section, are summarized in Table 1.

Table Notes. Positions and observed “sizes” of high-z DSFG-rich proto-clusters. Note the large variation in proto-cluster
solid angle and conﬁrmed galaxy density (i.e. number of galaxies belonging to the proto-cluster in its solid angle). It is likely
that these sizes and perceived galaxy densities are limited by observational selection eﬀects and are not representative of the
structures’ true physical characteristics.

at least 24 optically selected, spectroscopically conﬁrmed
members in addition to eleven rare types of galaxies span-
ning the entire GOODS-N ﬁeld of view (four submillime-
ter galaxies, ten radio galaxies, and six X-ray galaxies,
all of which have substantial overlap). While Chapman
et al. (2009) present potentially as many as nine DSFGs,
a few of those are spurious spikes in the original SCUBA
maps and others only bright radio galaxies (Amy Barger,
private communication).

Using deep data in HDF and more recent collections
of deep submillimeter data from Herschel (Oliver et al.
2012) and Scuba-2 (Chen et al. 2013), I re-derive far-
infrared SEDs for this GOODS-N structure’s DSFGs us-
ing a simple modiﬁed black body and powerlaw prescrip-
tion (Casey 2012). The modiﬁed black body dominates
the SED ﬁt at rest-frame wavelengths >∼ 40µm, and the
mid-infrared powerlaw dominates from 5 >∼ λ >∼ 40µm.
Note that the calculation of star-formation rates is
largely insensitive to far-infrared SED ﬁtting technique,
as diﬀerences in methods are typically much less than
measurement uncertainty (see § 4.2 of Casey, Narayanan
& Cooray 2014). The far-infrared photometry is pro-
vided in Table 3.
Stellar masses and star-formation
rates for non-DSFG members are determined via de-
tailed optical and near-infrared SED ﬁtting with Mag-

phys (da Cunha, Charlot & Elbaz 2008) to rest-frame
UV data through Spitzer IRAC available in GOODS-N
(Capak et al. 2004). The median stellar mass for non-
DSFG members is 6×109 M(cid:12) and the median SFR is
20 M(cid:12) yr−1. The total stellar mass for identiﬁed clus-
ter members is 6.5×1011 M(cid:12) and the total star-formation
rate is 2600±300 M(cid:12) yr−1. The aggregate star-formation
rate is dominated (88%) by the DSFGs, as is the stellar
mass total (70%).

The stellar masses of the GOODS-N proto-cluster
members can be checked by extrapolating Spitzer IRAC
photometry to rest-frame 1.6µm (Hainline et al. 2009),
as is done in Chapman et al. (2009). Although the star-
formation histories of DSFGs are quite uncertain, and
this compounds in the assumed mass-to-light ratio, I ap-
ply a LH/M(cid:63) = 7.9+0.8−2.1 L(cid:12)/mag (Hainline et al. 2011)
for DSFGs and LBGs alike and derive a total integrated
stellar mass of 1.3×1012 M(cid:12), within a factor of two of
the SED estimate. Treating each galaxy as its own halo
(which is appropriate given the spatial distribution of
such structures), a total dark matter halo mass is inferred
for the proto-cluster of (6±3)×1013 M(cid:12) at z = 1.99. As-
suming an exponential growth in line with large box sim-
ulations (Wechsler et al. 2002), this proto-cluster would
grow to a mass of (9 ± 5) × 1014 at z = 0.

‡ Source SMG130 was originally thought to be a submillimeter-faint star-forming radio galaxy (SFRG/OFRG) in Chapman et

The comoving volume is calculated within a 10(cid:48)×10(cid:48)
area and approximate redshift bounds of 1.982 < z <
2.010 as 9000 cMpc3. Most of this is along the line of
sight, as the spatial coverage for deep spectra does not
extend signiﬁcantly beyond the deep GOODS-N HST
coverage. It would be surprising if this structure is not
extended spatially beyond the limited ﬁeld-of-view of the
GOODS-N pencil-beam survey.

2.2. COSMOS structure at z = 2.10

Yuan et al. (2014) identify a Virgo-like progenitor in
the COSMOS ﬁeld at z = 2.095 with 57 spectroscopic
members with a cluster velocity dispersion measured to
be σ = 552 ± 52 km s−1. The proto-cluster was revealed
through spectroscopic follow-up of a zFOURGE candi-
date cluster at z = 2.2 identiﬁed with photometric tech-
niques by Spitler et al. (2012), and they predict a halo
mass at z ∼ 0 of 1014.4±0.3 M(cid:12).

MOS ﬁeld, there are seven spectroscopically-identiﬁed
DSFGs coincident with this structure, four of which are
published in Casey et al. (2012). The details of this
proto-cluster, its remaining DSFGs and AGN of which
there are ten total, will be discussed in more detail in
Hung et al., submitted. The DSFGs reach well beyond
the original bounds of the structure identiﬁed in Yuan
et al. (2014), and an LBG overdensity exists across ∼30(cid:48)
scales from zCOSMOS samples (Lilly et al. 2009). The
DSFG overdensity, centered at z = 2.10, is measured to
be δDSFG = 13, with a corresponding LBG overdensity
(measured from zCOSMOS) of δLBG = 8.

The extensive 30+ bands of imaging in the COSMOS
ﬁeld are used to infer stellar masses and star-formation
rates from SEDs with Magphys, all the details of which
will be given in Hung et al. The aggregate stellar mass
for these sources is 1.9×1012 M(cid:12) and star-formation rate
is 5300±600 M(cid:12) yr−1. A lower limit on the volume for
this structure is placed at 15000 cMpc3, using a sky area
coverage of 8(cid:48)×20(cid:48). While one of the DSFGs lies sig-

niﬁcantly outside of this area, and could easily justify a
doubling of the volume, spectroscopic incompleteness in
that patch of sky signiﬁcantly limits our ability to assess
the structure’s extent.

2.3. MRC1138−256, or the “Spiderweb Galaxy”

structure at z = 2.16

This structure was originally characterized in Kurk et
al. (2000) and has a number of candidate LAEs in addi-
tion to HAEs. The most notable member is the ‘Spider-
web Galaxy’ described by Kuiper et al. (2011), a radio-
loud starburst with luminous AGN and giant Lyα halo.
Dannerbauer et al. (2014) present submillimeter data of
the area, and point to a number of identiﬁed DSFGs that
could reside within the structure. From their work, ﬁve
DSFGs have secure spectroscopic conﬁrmation within a
much more spatially compact region.

The stellar masses of these DSFGs are estimated in
Dannerbauer et al. (2014), averaging around 1011 M(cid:12).
Lacking stellar mass estimates on the other spectroscop-
ically identiﬁed proto-cluster members, the aggregate
stellar mass can be estimated roughly at ∼1×1012 M(cid:12)
and inferred halo mass of 1×1014 M(cid:12) if abundance
matching is used to separately scale to halo mass. This
is perhaps less appropriate in this structure than in the
others given the compact spatial arrangement. It is pos-
sible that the mass surrounding the identiﬁed DSFGs in
this sub-halo has virialized. Further observations will be
crucial to interpreting the size and mass of this structure
(Kurk et al., in prep) and how it compares to the other
high-z structures in the literature.

Without detailed SED information on each proto-
cluster member, it is not possible to directly derive a
total star-formation rate to the system. However, given
the far-infrared photometry provided in Dannerbauer et
al. (2014), the SFR estimates are re-derived in a self-
consistent way, and arrive at 2200±500 M(cid:12) yr−1 as the
total for the structure. Note that this may be overesti-
mated due to lack of correction for confusion boosting
on the far-infrared photometry, but may be an underes-

timate due to lack of inclusion of all proto-cluster mem-
bers.
The volume estimate of 3000 cMpc3 for the struc-
ture surrounding MRC1138−256 uses a sky area roughly
6(cid:48)×9(cid:48) with a redshift interval 2.154 < z < 2.171. Like
the GOODS-N structure, MRC1138−256 is limited by a
narrow ﬁeld of view for multiwavelength follow-up, and
so all estimated parameters should be regarded as lower
limits, perhaps only representative of a smaller sub-halo
in a larger overdensity.

2.4. COSMOS structure at z = 2.47

Casey et al. (2015) describe an extended structure in
the COSMOS ﬁeld at z = 2.47 which contains seven
spectroscopically-conﬁrmed DSFGs, and ﬁve additional
AGN. The large-ﬁeld coverage of COSMOS is uniquely
useful in the identiﬁcation of this overdensity, as the LBG
excess is only moderate on smaller scales (<1(cid:48)). Intrigu-
ingly, a few other works identify a neighboring overden-
sity of LAEs (Diener et al. 2015; Chiang et al. 2015) at
z = 2.44 − 2.45. While this LAE-rich structure is oﬀset
both spatially and in redshift, by ∼50 cMpc, it could be
associated as part of a colossally-large overdensity. Lee
et al. (2016) detect this z = 2.44 − 2.45 structure using
absorption of neutral hydrogen in the IGM, though ex-
isting data is limited to the coincident spatial region and
does not cover the z ∼ 2.47 DSFG-rich structure. More
work is currently being carried out to determine the pos-
sible ﬁlamentary connection between the two, and if this
also relates to a possible overdensity of DSFGs detected
at z = 2.51 − 2.55 in the same ﬁeld. Note that the
number of galaxies in this structure has increased since
its initial publication in Casey et al. (2015); the public
release of results from the VIMOS Ultra Deep Survey
(VUDS) in February 2016 revealed an additional 15 pre-
viously unidentiﬁed, spectroscopically-conﬁrmed proto-
cluster members.
The detailed calculation of this structure’s net star-
formation rate of 4500±500 M(cid:12) yr−1, total stellar mass
of 1.0×1012, halo mass of (8±3)×1013, and volume of
15000 cMpc3 is given in Casey et al. (2015) and is calcu-
lated in a fully consistent way with the other structures
described in this paper.

2.5. SSA22 z = 3.09 Structure

The SSA22 structure was originally revealed in Stei-
del et al. (1998) as one of the ﬁrst high-z proto-clusters
ever detected in LBGs, and as such is probably one of
the best-studied proto-clusters in the literature. Narrow-
band Lyα follow-up has revealed an extended excess of
z = 3.1 LAEs extending as far as 60 Mpc comoving
(Hayashino et al. 2004; Yamada et al. 2012; Matsuda
et al. 2005). The full extent of the structure is shown in
Hayashino et al. (2004) in LAEs as reaching over three
distinct ﬁlaments about 20(cid:48)×3(cid:48), 10(cid:48)×4(cid:48) and 8(cid:48)×8(cid:48) across;
the implied volume in the redshift range 3.07 < z < 3.11
is ≈21000 cMpc3.

The structure is also home to an excess of DSFGs
(Tamura et al. 2009). Three DSFGs were spectroscopi-
cally conﬁrmed as proto-cluster members in Chapman et
al. (2005), a further three were identiﬁed as Lyα emit-
ters with submillimeter detections in Geach et al. (2005),
and most recently some ALMA-detected submillimeter

sources have spectroscopic conﬁrmations from the node
of the proto-cluster (Kubo et al. 2015; Umehata et al.
2015). Four of these sources are signiﬁcantly fainter than
the other eight, and so are excluded from the DSFG-
overdensity calculation though are still considered for
their bulk contributions to SFR. The FIR characteristics
of these twelve DSFGs are given in Table 4. Extrapo-
lating from the 850µm and 1.1 mm ﬂux density and a
35 K modiﬁed blackbody template, the SFRs measured
for SSA22 DSFGs ranges from 120–1400 M(cid:12) yr−1 and to-
tals 5670 M(cid:12) yr−1. In addition, there are twelve X-ray
luminous AGN present in the proto-cluster (Lehmer et
al. 2009), four of which overlap with the DSFGs, bringing
the total rare galaxy count to 13. Lehmer et al. (2009)
also ﬁnds evidence that the LBGs in SSA22 are a bit
more massive (by factors of 1.2–1.8) than LBGs in the
ﬁeld, and Hine et al. (2016) shows evidence for enhanced
merger rates in proto-cluster member galaxies.

It is diﬃcult to precisely identify how many spectro-
scopically conﬁrmed proto-cluster members sit in the
SSA22 proto-cluster. The original spectroscopic sample
has only 16 members, while the narrow-band follow-up
imaging around Lyα has 283 conﬁdent candidates ex-
tending ∼half a degree across the sky. In addition, there
have been several further spectroscopic campaigns in the
ﬁeld, conﬁrming a handful of interesting sources. No stel-
lar mass estimates are given for this structure, although
Steidel et al. (1998) do provide an estimate of the total
halo mass of (8±4)×1013 M(cid:12) computed using the implied
bias from the LBG overdensity.

2.6. The GN20 overdensity at z = 4.05

One of the brightest submillimeter galaxies from the
original Scuba surveys, GN20 eluded redshift identi-
ﬁcation for many years until Daddi et al. (2009) con-
ﬁrmed it at z = 4.055 through a serendipitous CO detec-
tion. Follow-up work revealed two accompanying galax-
ies, themselves submillimeter emitters, at the same red-
shift. This GN20 system is discussed in detail in Hodge
et al. (2013). This overdensity is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent
than the structures discussed so far, with far fewer proto-
cluster members identiﬁed through spectroscopy. This
may indicate that it is intrinsically less massive than the
other structures, or that spectroscopic incompleteness
is quite severe. Because the structure sits in the well
studied GOODS-N ﬁeld (like the GOODS-N structure
at z = 1.99) spectroscopic incompleteness is less likely,
particularly at a redshift where detecting Lyα emitters
would be fairly straightforward with ground-based opti-
cal multi-object spectrographs (Wirth et al. 2004; Cowie
et al. 2004).

Stellar mass estimates for this group are given in Daddi
et al. (2009) and Hodge et al. (2013) for the three DS-
FGs: GN20, GN20.2a, and GN20.2b. The sum of their
stellar masses is ∼3×1011 M(cid:12), and total star-formation
rate of 1500±800 M(cid:12) yr−1. Hodge et al. reveal six ten-
tative CO(2-1) detections surrounding the GN20 com-
plex, and the 50 cMpc3 volume for the structure is thus
estimated within a 4(cid:48)×3(cid:48) area and a redshift interval of
∆z = 0.0014 at z = 4.055. Like the lack of large numbers
of spectroscopic conﬁrmations, the estimated volume is
quite a bit smaller than the other structures presented
here, which may be due to the fact that we are looking at

FIR Characteristics of DSFGs in the SSA22 z = 3.09 structure

Table Notes. Sources with † preceding the name are not included in the calculation of SSA22’s rare object overdensity, δrare,
as they are much lower luminosities than the other DSFGs in the sample, detected over much larger areas. References are
1=Chapman et al. (2005), 2=Geach et al. (2005), 3=Umehata et al. (2015). 850µm ﬂux densities are taken from Chapman et
al. (2005) and Geach et al. (2005) while 1.1 mm ﬂux densities from ALMA are given in Umehata et al. (2015). Note that 850µm
coverage extends over a much larger area than the ‘ALMA Deep Field’ of the SSA22 proto-cluster node but with shallower
depth. The redshifts of the three LAEs are not precisely known as they were identiﬁed through narrow-band imaging and not
direct spectroscopic observations. The X-ray AGN column indicates whether or not the given DSFG is matched to an X-ray
source in Lehmer et al. (2009). Total infrared luminosities and star-formation rates are derived by assuming a 35 K dust modiﬁed
blackbody plus mid-infrared powerlaw.

a sub-halo in a larger structure, or more likely, a group
which is intrinsically less massive than the ﬁve structures
presented so far that sit at lower redshift.

2.7. The HDF 850.1 overdensity at z = 5.18

Walter et al. (2012) describes the massive starburst-
ing submillimeter galaxy HDF 850.1 and the structure
surrounding it at z ≈ 5.2. Like GN20, HDF 850.1 eluded
redshift conﬁrmation for over a decade and was only con-
ﬁrmed via detection of molecular gas. While it is the only
DSFG in this z = 5.2 overdensity, there is an accompany-
ing QSO and eleven other spectrosccopically-conﬁrmed
galaxies at the same redshift. This overdensity extends
across a large ﬁlamentary area 10(cid:48)×30(cid:48). Its total star for-
mation rate is estimated just using the single submillime-
ter source for lack of adequate photometric constraints on
the other proto-cluster members, at 850±300 M(cid:12) yr−1.
Similarly, given the high redshift of this structure, stel-
lar masses are unconstrained due to lack of atmospheric
transmission around rest-frame 1.6µm. Do note, how-
ever, that there is a dynamical mass constraint on the
galaxy HDF 850.1 of (1.3±0.4)×1011 M(cid:12), which can be
used as a lower limit to the halo mass of the system at
z ≈ 5.2. The volume estimate of 20000 cMpc3 is derived
assuming the above solid angle and a redshift range of
5.183 < z < 5.213.

2.8. The AzTEC-3 overdensity at z = 5.30

Capak et al. (2011) report the discovery of an overden-
sity surrounding the interesting luminous DSFG named
AzTEC-3 in the COSMOS ﬁeld. Within a 1(cid:48) diameter
region, there appear to be twelve proto-cluster members
at z ≈ 5.3, including the single DSFG AzTEC-3 and one
X-ray detected quasar at a distance of 13 Mpc from the
starburst. Similar to the HDF 850.1 overdensity, estimat-
ing stellar masses for these sources is quite challenging,
although Capak et al. (2011) oﬀer this computation di-
rectly, totaling >2×1010 M(cid:12). They extrapolate this to

a halo mass using abundance matching techniques and
estimate a lower limit of >4×1011 M(cid:12). The total SFR
estimate is again taken for the sole DSFG member at
1600±500 M(cid:12) yr−1. The volume of the structure is es-
timated within a 0.5(cid:48) radius and a ∆z = 0.03 interval,
arriving at a lower limit of >∼ 500 cMpc3. As is the case
with the other high-redshift overdensities, it is important
to stress that the AzTEC-3 system could be the progen-
itor of a less massive overdensity.

2.9. Candidate DSFG-rich Proto-clusters

It is important to emphasize again that a number of
candidate high-z, DSFG-rich proto-clusters have recently
been found thanks to wide-area surveys like those from
Planck and Herschel but are awaiting spectroscopic con-
ﬁrmation (Clements et al. 2014; Planck Collaboration
et al. 2015; Flores-Cacho et al. 2016).
It is similarly
important to stress that not all other spectroscopically-
identiﬁed z > 2 proto-clusters have the sensitive submil-
limeter datasets needed to detect potential DSFG mem-
ber galaxies (e.g. Lee et al. 2014).

CLUSTERS

3. FROM DSFG-RICH PROTO-CLUSTERS TO Z ∼ 0
Such physically large, extended structures − like those
observationally identiﬁed in § 2 − are not certain to
collapse into massive galaxy clusters. How can we ad-
equately determine whether or not these structures will
collapse by z ∼ 0? And does their number density agree
with what is known about galaxy clusters at z ∼ 0?

3.1. Will they collapse?

Two schools of thought have been used to address this
question. The ﬁrst draws on the Press-Schechter for-
malism (Press & Schechter 1974) for spherical collapse
within large scale structure (Mo & White 1996), whereby
a certain mass overdensity, δmass, is required to exceed
a speciﬁc critical value δc to collapse by z ∼ 0 (Pea-

Assembly History of z > 2 Proto-clusters

cock 1999). Because the mass overdensity is not di-
rectly observable, linear galaxy bias is assumed whereby
1 + bδmass = C(1 + δgal), and δgal is the observed galaxy
overdensity, b is the bias associated with that galaxy pop-
ulation (i.e. how well they trace the dark matter halo
mass), and C is a redshift distortion factor accounting
for unknown peculiar velocities.

For example, the analysis of the GOODS-N z = 1.99
structure in Chapman et al. (2009) ﬁnds an SMG over-
density of δ = 10, suﬃcient to cause collapse, however
the underlying LBG population overdensity, δLBG = 2.5,
is not signiﬁcant enough to cause collapse. These two
assessments of the structure are seemingly contradictory,
but the authors address this contradiction by suggesting
that either the bias of the submillimeter galaxy popu-
lation is suﬃciently diﬀerent than for LBGs, or there
could be a large population of massive galaxies that have
not been detected surrounding the structure. Given the
depth of multiwavelength imaging in GOODS-N the lat-
ter is unlikely. Thus Chapman et al. determined that the
bias for SMGs (or DSFGs) and LBGs was suﬃciently dif-
ferent, and so even a large overdensity of SMGs may not
probe massive clusters in formation.

This conclusion is further supported in Miller et al.
(2015) who use large-volume semi-analytic simulations
from Klypin, Trujillo-Gomez & Primack (2011) to ar-
gue that SMGs are “poor tracers” of the most massive
structures at z ∼ 2, observing very few massive struc-
tures containing more than 1–3 SMGs. The structures
observed with >5 SMGs are indeed amongst the most
massive, but are exceedingly rare in the simulation, much
more so than the observations in § 2 suggest. This dis-
crepancy between their predicted number of DSFG-rich
proto-clusters and our observations are shown as green
and blue points on the cluster mass function plot in Fig-
ure 1, discussed in more detail in the next subsection.

Note that other simulations groups (Granato et al.
2015; Lacey et al. 2015) have been working to understand
the turn-on of luminous DSFGs in large-box simulations
where the collapse of the most massive structures can
be seen. The advantage of these techniques is the abil-
ity to directly constrain SMGs’ physical drivers, which
they largely attribute to disk instabilities and a mildly
top-heavy IMF. However, as highlighted in those works,
it is still incredibly challenging to carry through proper
radiative transfer in such large environments, especially
on ∼20 cMpc scales before clusters have collapsed.

The second school of thought draws on recent cosmo-
logical simulations of hierarchical growth, which produce
somewhat diﬀerent predictions than those relying on an-
alytic descriptions of structure formation theory. For ex-
ample, Chiang, Overzier & Gebhardt (2013) present a
clear argument as to why spherical collapse models and
the assumed linear regime for overdensities may intro-
duce systematic errors in mass measurements for non-
virialized proto-clusters. These direct predictions from
simulations suggest that: (a) the median observed galaxy
overdensity, δgal, rarely, if ever, exceeds 10 (this agrees
with the predictions given in Miller et al. 2015), (b) δgal
at these epochs also depends strongly on the observa-
tional characteristics being selected for, for example SFR
or stellar mass, and sensibly vary between DSFG popu-
lations (very high SFR-selected samples) and LBG pop-
ulations (a combination of SFR and mass selected, at

Fig. 1.— A comparison of the Cluster Mass Function from Bah-
call & Cen (1993) against the extrapolated estimate of DSFG-rich
proto-cluster descendants (blue point). The uncertainty is domi-
nated by the limited understanding of the DSFG-rich proto-cluster
selection function, and the survey area from which they have been
found; future large-area surveys will enable a much more accurate
constraint. If DSFG-rich proto-clusters are assumed to be a short-
lived phenomenon, then an upper limit (red arrow) marks maxi-
mum density for DSFG-rich structures. The estimate of DSFG-rich
proto-clusters (i.e. those with ﬁve or more DSFGs) from large-box
Bolshoi simulations is shown as the green point (Hayward et al.
2013; Miller et al. 2015).

much deeper detection thresholds), (c) the progenitors
of massive galaxy clusters at z > 2 occupy very large La-
grange volumes, >∼ 10000 cMpc3 (see also O˜norbe et al.
2014), and (d) δgal will vary for structures of the same
mass depending on the ‘window size’ of observations, or
presumed volume, given intrinsic variations in the under-
lying density along ﬁlaments.
For example, a close inspection of Figure 8 in Chiang,
Overzier & Gebhardt (2013)− a plot of the cumulative
fraction of proto-clusters with observed galaxy overden-
sities δg at z = 2, 3, 4 and 5−provides a backdrop to
interpret the likelihood of proto-cluster collapse. Among
the ﬁve rich 1.99 < z < 3.09 proto-clusters described
in § 2, all structures are expected to collapse by z ∼ 0.
The structure with the least remarkable LBG overden-
sity at δgal = 2.5, the GOODS-N z = 1.99 structure, is
still among the top 30% of collapsing structures. The
remainder are in the top 5–10%.
It should be clariﬁed, however that the three highest
redshift overdensities discussed in § 2 and summarized in
Table 1 have a less clear fate. With far fewer numbers of
galaxies (in both rare sub-types and total number), Pois-
son noise dominates the calculation of the overdensities,
causing a wide margin of error on the structures’ pre-
dicted state at z ∼ 0. These are the types of structures
which may either be prone to mass overestimation, due
to the eﬀects discussed in Miller et al. (2015), or suﬀer
from incomplete spectroscopic descriptions, though the
latter interpretation may be limited by constraints set
by the volume density of DSFG-rich proto-clusters as a
whole.

C. M. Casey

While the argument for the eventual collapse of DSFG-
rich proto-clusters into the most massive z ∼ 0 clusters
has been made in § 3, it is not immediately obvious that
this evolutionary picture is feasible or likely, given the
relatively small number of high-mass clusters at z ∼ 0.
In Figure 1, the cluster mass function at z <∼ 0.2 is shown
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (Bahcall & Cen 1993;
Bahcall et al. 2003). This tells us that there is one
>1015 M(cid:12) cluster per every 1–2 million Mpc3, or per
∼120×120×120 Mpc comoving box.

We can also work out a rough estimate to the vol-
ume density of DSFG-rich proto-clusters for comparison.
A signiﬁcant discrepancy between the volume density
of z ∼ 0 massive clusters and z >∼ 2 DSFG-rich proto-
clusters is a sign that the two populations are not likely
related1. This was claimed to be the case in Blain et al.
(2004), after analyzing the overdensity associated with
the GOODS-N z = 1.99 structure, and a few other po-
tential SMG-rich overdensities perceived in the ﬁrst few
square degrees of deep submm imaging. Blain et al. de-
termined that DSFG-rich structures were unlikely to be
the progenitors of massive clusters in formation because
they are ∼10 times more common at z >∼ 2 than their
z ∼ 0 descendants, which was reﬂective of the best data
on-hand at the time. Here this estimation is reassessed
with improved datasets.
To estimate the volume density of DSFG-rich proto-
clusters at z >∼ 2, understanding survey area and selec-
tion bias is critical. Survey area in this case is set by the
solid angle of sky covered to suﬃcient depth to recover
DSFG-rich structures at high-redshift. This requires
both spectroscopically complete samples and confusion-
limited submillimeter blank-ﬁeld maps. Both are ex-
tremely limited by current observational resources. The
former is limited by the need for several tens of nights on
8–10 m class optical/near-infrared telescopes for multi-
object spectroscopy of faint i ∼ 22 − 26 sources (of
which only a few ﬁelds have truly complete coverage,
e.g. GOODS-N, central portion of COSMOS, ECDF-S),
and the later is limited by the historically slow mapping
speeds of single-dish bolometer array instruments like
SCUBA (also LABOCA, MAMBO, AzTEC, and now
SCUBA-2). The intersection of these two datasets is
therefore limited to:

• about 0.4 deg2 in GOODS-N, a ﬁeld with confusion
limited 850µm data (Barger et al. 1998; Chen et
al. 2013) and extensive spectroscopic completeness
(Cowie et al. 2004; Wirth et al. 2004; Reddy et al.
2006; Barger, Cowie & Wang 2008),

• the central 1 deg2 of the COSMOS ﬁeld, which
has published confusion-limited 850µm data cov-
ering 0.2 deg2 (more yet in Geach et al., in prep),
and 1 deg2 of deep spectroscopic data from the
zCOSMOS team (Lilly et al. 2009),

• about 0.5 deg2 in ECDF-S with confusion-limited
submm data from LABOCA and ALMA (Weiß
et al. 2009; Hodge et al. 2013) and spectroscopic

follow-up from Popesso et al. (2009), Balestra et
al. (2010), and Le F`evre et al. (2005), and

• a 0.5 deg2 portion of the Lockman Hole (SHADES)
ﬁeld with for which a signiﬁcant number of DSFGs
have been spectroscopically conﬁrmed (Chapman
et al. 2005; Lindner et al. 2011; Casey et al. 2012),
and

• other deep submillimeter ﬁelds, which include the
backgrounds of
low-redshift Abell clusters (e.g.
Smail, Ivison & Blain 1997; Chen et al. 2013) and
the SSA13 and SSA22 ﬁelds, and cumulatively add
up to about ∼0.5 deg2.

This collection of deep surveys adds up to a total eﬀec-
tive survey solid angle of ∼3 deg2, with an uncertainty of
about ∼0.5 deg2 to account for variable levels of spectro-
scopic completeness and submm data quality and depth.
While it should be noted that Herschel coverage also
spans all of these legacy ﬁelds, the intersection with spec-
troscopic samples is the main limiting factor in making
use of it for this analysis. In addition, Herschel is most ef-
ﬁcient at identifying DSFGs at z < 2 (Casey et al. 2012),
a characteristic of its shorter-wavelength selection than
ground-based submm datasets. Color selection with the
Herschel bands seems like an eﬃcient method of recov-
ering a higher-redshift sample (e.g. Dowell et al. 2014;
Asboth et al. 2016), though the depth and completeness
of these ‘500µm-peakers’ is less well characterized.
It
is important to emphasize that this estimation is very
rough, as the complexity of these datasets is incredibly
diﬃcult to quantify in a simple analysis.

The corresponding solid angle to this 3 deg2 is con-
verted to a cosmological comoving volume within the
redshift interval of interest, which is approximated as
1.9 < z < 4.5, the lower limit deﬁned by the limit of
known virialized clusters and the upper limit constrained
by low completeness in most large spectroscopic surveys
summarized above. Allowing for some additional uncer-
tainty in the redshift interval, the total volume accessible
is (9±3)×107 cMpc3. By chance this is approximately
the same volume probed by deep SDSS cluster surveys,
∼400 deg2 out to z ∼ 0.1−0.2 (Bahcall et al. 2003), from
which the nearby cluster mass function is measured.

Though there are clearly these ﬁve, bona-ﬁde DSFG-
rich proto-clusters identiﬁed in the literature, one is sub-
stantially impacted by a possible selection bias associ-
ated with the proto-cluster. Much of the deep data as-
sociated with MRC1138−256 at z = 2.16 was obtained
with the explicit knowledge of the proto-clusters’ pres-
ence, and so it cannot be included in the calculation
estimating their volume density. Thus four DSFG-rich
proto-clusters are left for the volume density calculation:
GOODS-N at z = 1.99, COSMOS at z = 2.10, COS-
MOS at z = 2.47, and SSA22 at z = 3.09. A Pois-
son uncertainty is assumed for the number of DSFG-
rich proto-clusters. The implied volume density is then
∼5×10−8 cMpc−3 for DSFG-rich proto-clusters. This is
depicted by the blue point on Figure 1 and is in rough
agreement with the observed z ∼ 0 cluster mass function.
There is one remaining concern with this calculation.
If this estimate is consistent with the z ∼ 0 local clus-
ter mass function, then it may imply every z >∼ 2 proto-
cluster should be DSFG-rich. This is not obviously the

proto-cluster which sustains a constant SFR≈3000±1500 M(cid:12) yr−1 from z ∼ 4 to z = 0, but whose SFR density increases by a factor of
∼100 from z = 2 to z = 0 due to the dramatic reduction in comoving volume as the cluster collapses and virializes. Real clusters may see
this steep rise in ρSFR from z = 2 to z = 1, but then experience some type of quenching which cuts oﬀ ongoing star-formation at more
recent times z < 1, as demonstrated by some of the low-z clusters shown in green and purple here.

one variable, how galaxies in proto-clusters more closely

case. Before addressing this issue further, one must ﬁrst
consider the timescale of DSFGs and their implications
on clusters’ assembly histories.

3.3. Star-Formation in DSFG-rich Proto-clusters

Placing DSFG-rich proto-clusters in context requires
a more detailed look at their observable star-formation
characteristics in comparison to the ﬁeld (i.e. normal
density regions), and lower redshift virialized clusters.
Figure 2 shows the cosmic star-formation rate density
from 0 < z < 4 as compiled by Hopkins & Beacom (2006)
for the ﬁeld, against similar measures for overdense en-
vironments.

DSFG-rich proto-clusters at 2 < z < 3 only have
slightly elevated ρSFR than the ﬁeld, thanks primarily
to the large volumes they occupy prior to virialization.
On the other hand, virialized clusters at z < 1 have sub-
stantially higher ρSFR, peaking around 0.5 < z < 1.0,
while potentially experiencing suppressed star-formation
at lower redshifts brought on by diﬀerent environmental
mechanisms. Note that the comparison between virial-
ized clusters and the ﬁeld uses comoving volume, as op-
posed to proper volume, for fair comparison with struc-
tures which have not yet collapsed and decoupled from
the Hubble ﬂow. All values of SFR are converted to a
Chabrier IMF (Chabrier 2003). The gray band marks the
evolution of a hypothetical cluster that sustains an ag-

Figure 3 takes a closer look at the breakdown of
the star-formation rate function, or luminosity function
within a DSFG-rich proto-cluster in comparison to the
ﬁeld. For context, the Lyman-Break Galaxy luminosity
function of Reddy & Steidel (2009) is converted to a SFR
function using the UV-scaling in Kennicutt (1998) and
applying a factor of ﬁve correction for extinction (i.e.
most LBGs are 80% obscured; Reddy et al. 2012). The
highest redshift luminosity function from the infrared
(Gruppioni et al. 2013) is converted to a SFR also using
the Kennicutt prescription, adjusted for a Chabrier IMF.
Against these ﬁeld measurements, the SFR function of
DSFG-rich proto-clusters is shown: all of the known
members of the COSMOS z = 2.47 proto-cluster (Casey
et al. 2015) in red, and the DSFG member galaxies of all
ﬁve 1.99 < z < 3.09 structures in black stars. The key
distinguishing characteristic of DSFG-rich proto-clusters
is the ﬂattening of the luminosity function towards high
SFRs. While there may be an excess of LBGs observed
in high-z proto-clusters, the excess is not as great as the
factor >∼ 10 excess towards the highest SFRs.

4. SIMULTANEOUS TRIGGERING, OR NOT?

Here the likelihood of several rare types of galaxies be-
ing observed simultaneously within a large structure is
explored. If you work from the premise that both pop-
ulations of DSFGs and AGN are short-lived on 100 Myr
timescales, then one can ask what the probability is of
observing N of them simultaneously in one structure
(where N >∼ 5).
If the probability is low, and yet the
prevalence of such DSFG-rich structures is high, then
one may think this is evidence that clusters themselves
assemble in rapid bursts, even when extended over very
large volumes >∼ 10000 cMpc3 (as suggested in Casey et
al. 2015).

Care should be taken in correcting for the dynamical
time of each DSFG at diﬀerent redshifts, as discussed in
Simpson et al. (2014). At higher redshifts, a ﬁxed dz
element probes shorter and shorter timescales, such that
the probability of observing all DSFGs which have been
triggered during that time element dz increases from low
fractions at low-z to 100% at high-z. While large red-
shift bins with widths ∆z = 0.1 − 0.2 will probe all such
episodes, it is important to note that the redshift range
probed by a single coherent structure, dz ≈ 0.02, only
corresponds to a crossing time of ≈ 20 Myr, shorter than
the expected duration of the burst phase. If this itself
were to exceed the estimated lifetimes of our rare galax-
ies, that could provide an easy explanation as to why
we observe structures that are quite rich in DSFGs and
luminous AGN. However, that is not the case.
Another possible explanation for the plethora of rare
galaxies is that we actually expect nearly all z ∼ 0 galaxy
cluster members to have gone through such a rare phase
at some time in its past, probably around z ∼ 2− 3. But

Fig. 4.— The probability of observing ≥ N rare galaxies (includ-
ing DSFGs and luminous AGN) simultaneously in one proto-cluster
structure, if uncorrelated, random triggering is assumed. With
40±10 massive >1011 M(cid:12) galaxies in present-day massive galaxy
clusters (van der Burg et al. 2013), one can assume all of them
passed through a DSFG phase at some point between 1 < z < 6 in
which they build the majority of their mass. If the rare galaxies are
triggered at random during that time/redshift interval (i.e. they
are uncorrelated events) the likelihood that N or more of them
would be ‘on’ simultaneously is shown, given an average lifetime of
50 Myr (purple), 100 Myr (blue), 150 Myr (teal), or 500 Myr (gray).
For example, if DSFGs are short-lived, the likelihood of observing
>3 per structure is very low. Conversely, if DSFGs are long-lived,
we are more likely to see structures with ≥8 DSFGs than with
fewer.

in investigating this further, there is a problem. The
most massive galaxy clusters at z ∼ 1 only have 40±10
galaxies above a stellar mass of 1011 M(cid:12) (van der Burg et
al. 2013). If one presumes all of these have gone through
a DSFG phase at some point during their mass buildup
(as most of them are quiescent by z = 0.5 − 1), then
by working backwards, the likelihood of observing N of
them in a DSFG or luminous AGN phase simultaneously
can be worked out. Here the time T it takes for the
structure to collapse from its primordial ﬂuctuations is
relatively unknown, but is loosely constrained by the red-
shift interval 1 < z < 6 (≈5 Gyr), or 2 < z < 5 (≈2 Gyr).
Figure 4 shows the probability of simultaneously ob-
serving ≥ N DSFGs/AGN within one structure forming
over the course of 2 Gyr. Assuming a 2 Gyr timescale ren-
ders the probability calculations in Figure 4 conservative,
as allowing for longer fall-in times makes the probabilities
of observing multiple DSFGs simultaneously only lower.
Four diﬀerent rare-galaxy timescales are assumed (where
“rare” can refer to either the DSFGs or the short-lived,
luminous AGN in this case): 50 Myr (in line with what
is observed in local ULIRGs; Solomon & Sage 1988),
100 Myr (the typical DSFG timescale and upper limit to
QSO lifetimes; Greve et al. 2005; Martini 2004), 150 Myr
(a depletion time typical of some longer lived DSFGs
at high-redshift; Swinbank et al. 2014), and 500 Myr (a
DSFG timescale which would rely on some sustained gas
fueling, which some assert is likely the case at the mas-
sive end of the galaxy ‘main-sequence;’ Elbaz et al. 2011).
This ﬁgure illustrates that the assumed timescale for
DSFGs and luminous AGN is rather important to our

understanding of cluster assembly. Over a 2 Gyr build
time, if DSFGs/AGN are short-lived then the probability
of observing >5 such sources in one proto-cluster struc-
ture is <0.5% (50 Myr), 6.1% (100 Myr), 19% (150 Myr),
77% (500 Myr). However, structures like the COSMOS
z = 2.47 structure and SSA22 contain 12 rare sources
each.
With a short-lived phase, this is virtually impossible
through uncorrelated triggering (<1×10−4%), and still
yet unlikely for long duration events (<25%).
If such
phenomena are short-lived, then they most certainly are
triggered simultaneously in an event that stretches across
very large volumes. One can imagine this triggering is
brought on by the rapid collapse of ﬁlamentary structure
that extends across several tens of Mpc.

On the other hand, the test above seems to suggest
that longer lifetimes are far more likely (by over a factor
of ten) for DSFGs and luminous AGN in proto-clusters.
Recent simulations work (Narayanan et al. 2015) suggest
that even somewhat isolated DSFGs could sustain suf-
ﬁciently high star-formation rates ( >∼ 500 M(cid:12) yr−1) for
0.75 Gyr. Physically, this sounds plausible particularly
in dense environments, where high star-formation rates
may be sustained over longer periods of time if the galax-
ies are continually fed fresh supplies of gas from the sur-
rounding, rich medium. In the next few subsections, I
explore observations which support both rapid collapse
and heightened gas supply scenarios.

4.1. Molecular Gas Depletion Time

Determining the correct interpretation of the assem-
bly history of galaxy clusters requires direct constraints
of the molecular gas potential wells in proto-cluster DS-
FGs. This gives critical information on galaxies’ current
gas supply, and over what time period such high star-
formation rates would be continuously sustainable. To
reiterate, this is a particularly useful measurement in DS-
FGs due to their rarity, as demonstrated in the previous
section.

Table 5 summarizes existing CO observations of proto-
cluster DSFGs from the literature. Though limited
in number and heterogeneous in transition and depth,
these data can begin to discern the plausibility of short-
lived versus long-lived interpretations. However, as with
most previous work on high-z CO observations it is very
important to recognize that the conversion from ob-
served CO line strength to H2 gas mass is highly un-
certain.
It ﬁrst requires a conversion from a high-J
CO transition to the ground state CO(1-0), which re-
quires knowledge of the galaxy’s mean CO excitation
ladder, or kinetic gas temperature. Second, the con-
version from CO(1-0) to MH2, known as XCO or αCO,
can also range by factors of 5–10 depending on gas con-
ditions in the ISM. For example, the Milky Way has
a gas conversion rate of αCO =4.5 M(cid:12) (K km s−1 pc2)−1
(Bloemen et al. 1986; Solomon et al. 1987) while typ-
ical local ULIRGs have αCO =0.8 M(cid:12) (K km s−1 pc2)−1
(Downes & Solomon 1998). The uncertainties in these
two conversions alone can account for a factor of >∼ 10
in the predicted gas mass, which could dramatically af-
fect the interpretation of the depletion timescale, τdepl =
MH2/SFR.

source’s depletion times is represented as a Gaussian with associ-
ated uncertainty. Here τdepl = MH2 /SFR, and MH2 is estimated
from observations of CO. While only eight proto-cluster DSFGs in

all observed DSFGs to-date. Their ﬁgure 3 shows
this median DSFG spectral
line-energy distribution.
Each high-J CO line luminosity in Table 5 is thus
converted to an estimated CO(1-0) line luminosity via
L(cid:48)
CO(1−0)/L(cid:48)
CO(J−[J−1]) = (SCO(1−0)/SCO(J−[J−1]))(1/J)2.
The uncertainty in the CO Spectral Line Energy Distri-
bution (SLED) is reﬂected in the resulting uncertainty of
CO(1-0) line luminosity. The conversion from L(cid:48)
CO(1−0)
to MH2 assumes αCO = 1.0 MH2 (K km s−1 pc2)−1, the
same value adopted in Bothwell et al. (2013) and
justiﬁed generally through some limited dynamical mass
constraints. The resulting gas masses MH2 are given
in Table 5, with some proto-cluster DSFGs containing
multiple components. In the case where multiple high-J
CO transitions are observed for a single galaxy, a molec-
ular gas mass is derived for each independently, then
averaged. Depletion times are then calculated by taking
the total molecular gas mass estimated to be present in
the system and dividing by the current star-formation
rate, as calculated in § 2. The probability distribution

cluster. The measured gas depletion times for proto-
cluster DSFGs (as presented in Table 5 and Figure 5)
are the most crucial constraint to this argument, but it
is signiﬁcantly strengthened by inferred constraints on
the lifetimes of AGN with comparable luminosities to
unobscured quasars (Marconi et al. 2004). The strong
evidence for short-lifetimes, combined with the low prob-
ability of observing N >∼ 5 of these rare galaxies in one
structure, argue for correlated, simultaneous triggering.
Such simultaneous triggering has been directly demon-
strated in smaller isolated cases, as in Ivison et al. (2013),
though not on physical scales this large. If correct, the
result is rather extraordinary, as it represents the only
type of direct observation of a temporal ‘event’ on cos-
mological scales, spanning a volume ∼104 cMpc3. In the
next subsection, I brieﬂy explore evidence which supports
the contrary conclusion.

4.3. Evidence in favor of Gradually-Built Proto-clusters
Though analysis of literature DSFGs in proto-clusters
suggests they are mostly short-lived, the impact of our
high-J CO to gas mass assumptions should be revis-

ited. If our assumptions were to be revised in favor of
more ‘Milky Way’ type gas excitation and higher intrin-
sic value of αCO, the CO(1-0) line luminosities would
be a factor of ∼3 higher, and the gas masses a factor
of ∼20 higher. The median depletion time of 110 Myr
would instead be 2.2 Gyr, much more in line with the
predicted long-lifetimes of DSFGs in some cosmological
simulations (Narayanan et al. 2015). Reducing the in-
trinsic uncertainty in this measurement requires CO(1-0)
measurements of a larger sample of proto-cluster DSFGs
with additional resolved dynamical mass constraints to
hone in on the correctly applicable αCO. Some of these
observations are currently underway at the Jansky Very
Large Array. However, it should be noted that there is a
known upper limit to how long DSFGs can sustain high-
SFRs, given by stellar mass constraints for the Universe’s
most massive galaxies. For example, a galaxy cannot rea-
sonably maintain a 500 M(cid:12) yr−1 star-formation rate for
longer than 1 Gyr or so, else the mass of stars produced
will exceed 5×1011 M(cid:12).
Another possible caveat to our rapid collapse argu-
ment is the possibly heightened replenishment of gas

Assembly History of z > 2 Proto-clusters

reservoirs from the IGM. It has recently become clear
that galaxies recycle gas through ejective feedback and
outﬂows, and the eventual reaccretion of material on
∼Gyr timescales (Christensen et al. 2015); however, it
is unclear how dense environments at the intersections
of ﬁlaments in the IGM might shorten the gas recycling
timescale and potential heightened inﬂow of pristine ma-
terial.
If molecular gas is fed onto galaxies more eﬃ-
ciently in proto-clusters than in the ﬁeld, particularly on
∼100 Myr timescales, then the depletion time measure-
ment might not be an accurate reﬂection of the lifetime
of high-SFR systems. However, such a dramatically fast
( <∼ 100 Myr) replenishment of ∼1010 M(cid:12) gas reservoir is
unlikely, again due to the upper limit placed on high-SFR
timescale from observed stellar mass functions.
Finally, as mentioned at the end of § 3.2, the frequency
of DSFG-rich proto-clusters among the population of all
proto-clusters raises a potential concern. If the timescale
of the DSFG-rich phase is short-lived and unique, then
one may only expect a small subset of observed z > 2
proto-clusters to have such DSFG excesses. To gauge
the plausibility of this argument, we should consider how
many member galaxies we expect to go through such a
phase over the course of a cluster’s lifetime. In § 4, this
was approximated as 40±10 massive >1011 M(cid:12) galax-
ies.
If there are 5–10 rare galaxies per proto-cluster,
then we may expect such structures to go through 4–8
“episodes” of heightened activity before virialization at
z < 2. If these episodes are assumed to all occur between
2 < z < 5 (≈2 Gyr) then one would expect ∼20–40% of
all proto-clusters of that epoch to be DSFG-rich assum-
ing a 100 Myr ‘burst’ lifetime. With a 150 Myr lifetime,
the fraction shifts to ∼30-60%, and at 50 Myr only ∼10-
20%. Though these fractions are certainly non-negligible,
it is clear that it would be nearly impossible for all z > 2
proto-clusters to be DSFG-rich if they are short-lived and
therefore our comparison to the measured cluster mass
function at z ∼ 0 might disfavor short timescales. It is
certainly clear that reﬁning measurements of the volume
density of high-z proto-clusters is needed before ruling
out diﬀerent histories of their assembly.

5. PREDICTIONS

5.1. Future Observations

The most important observational characteristic of
massive galaxy clusters is the large area they subtend
on the sky, ∼half a degree across. While some recent
works have recognized the importance of this (e.g. Mul-
drew, Hatch & Cooke 2015), the observational commu-
nity which works on proto-cluster science has largely
overlooked the shear scale of early, overdense structures.
It is critical to address this if we desire to move beyond
simple proto-cluster discoveries and learn about the col-
lapse of large scale structure from an observational per-
spective.
The next generation of wide ﬁeld (and suﬃciently
deep) surveys − on order tens of square degrees − will be
of great importance to identifying statistically large sam-
ples (∼100) of proto-clusters, both those with and with-
out rare galaxies. The most eﬃcient means of conﬁrm-
ing high-redshift overdensities like these will be through
direct far-infrared/millimeter molecular line detection,
which may only be eﬃcient on large scales with the next

generation of submm single-dish multi-pixel spectrome-
ters. The relative fraction of such structures with rare
galaxies will, in turn, allow the more detailed look at all
clusters’ temporal evolution.

On slightly smaller angular scales, recent work from
Clements et al. (2014), Planck Collaboration et al. (2015)
and Flores-Cacho et al. (2016) search out proto-clusters
rich in dusty star-formation by leveraging the poor spa-
tial resolution of the Planck satellite, which covers the
entire sky. Following-up Planck’s ∼5(cid:48) point sources
with the higher resolution Herschel Space Observatory is
hoped to be an eﬃcient way of identifying early clusters
in formation. While none have yet been spectroscopically
conﬁrmed, over 200 candidate high-redshift clusters have
been identiﬁed with an excess of dusty starbursts peak-
ing at >∼ 350µm. The technique is certainly promising
though will be quite incomplete in the type of structure
discussed in this paper, as many dusty starbursts would
need to fall in one Planck beam, much smaller than the
previously discussed half-degree scale.

In terms of characterizing known structures more fully,
narrow-band imaging should provide the most complete
mapping of ﬁlamentary structures on the largest scales.
This is the case in the SSA22 z = 3.09 structure, as
well as some structures not observed in the submillime-
ter (e.g. the Bo¨otes z = 3.78 structure; Lee et al. 2014)
but has not been pursued over suﬃciently large angular
scales for most proto-clusters. Similarly, wide-ﬁeld IFU
spectroscopic follow-up will be quite valuable, from fa-
cilities like the VIRUS instrument on the Hobby-Eberly
Telescope.

It is clear that understanding galaxies’ gas supply is an
essential element in discerning proto-clusters’ assembly
history, and in the age of ALMA and the Jansky VLA, is
not limited to the most luminous, rare galaxies. Scaling
of long-wavelength dust continuum to an ISM mass has
shown to be a useful proxy (Scoville et al. 2014, 2015) to
galaxies’ star-forming molecular gas masses. Thus fairly
inexpensive observational campaigns to constrain the gas
content of proto-clusters’ normal galaxy members might
provide more important clues as to how environment in-
ﬂuences galaxies’ evolution.

5.2. Simulations

Simulations of large-scale structure collapse on cosmo-
logical scales plays a crucial role in our current picture of
galaxy cluster formation, linking the huge gap between
observations of nearby virialized clusters and the imprint
of density perturbations on the Cosmic Microwave Back-
ground. Large-box >100 Mpc simulations are certainly
needed to analyze >1015 M(cid:12) halos. Their enormous vol-
umes limit the incorporation of baryonic physics and
force the implementation of ultraluminous starbursts, or
luminous AGN, to be somewhat crude. Yet, there are
some basic measurements which could be extracted from
the current generation of simulations that would shed
ample light on the proposed assembly history of mas-
sive galaxy clusters.
In dark-matter only simulations,
the most direct probe of cluster assembly is the merg-
ing of dark matter halos with time. These merger trees,
mapped with spatial distribution, could directly trace
whether or not growth of halos, and thus the galaxies
living in them, is episodic or steady.

Beyond the measurement of stochasticity in assembly,

14

simulations will be needed to more accurately constrain
dark matter halo masses from observations. While it is
clear that linear bias assumptions break down under cer-
tain pretexts, it is not entirely appropriate to use normal
abundance matching techniques which are more ideally
suited for isolated halos. An in-depth look at halo mass
distributions in proto-clusters before virialization might
provide crucial insight that bridges our theoretical un-
derstanding to observational constraints.

6. CONCLUSIONS

This paper has employed literature datasets to demon-
strate that several high-redshift proto-cluster environ-
ments are rich with rare galaxies: both dusty star-
forming galaxies and ultraluminous AGN. These proto-
clusters subtend 10(cid:48) to a half degree in the sky because
they have not yet relaxed into virialized galaxy clusters.
By virtue of their large occupied volumes at z >∼ 2 (fac-
tors of a few hundred larger than at z ∼ 0), it is very
diﬃcult to detect their signiﬁcance via an overdensity
of ‘normal’ galaxies on appropriately large scales, which
are only slightly more dense than the ﬁeld. Instead, an
unexpected excess of rare galaxies ( >∼ 5 per ∼104 cMpc3
volume) can demonstrate a more compelling argument
for a large-scale proto-cluster in formation.

Five bona-ﬁde DSFG-rich proto-clusters have been
identiﬁed to-date within 1.99 < z < 3.09. Estimates to
their volume density−constrained by deep spectroscopic
and submm datasets−is ∼5×10−8 cMpc−3, similar to the
density of observed >1015 M(cid:12) clusters at z < 0.2. Some
simulations work expect the volume density of DSFG-
rich structures to be a factor of ∼5 less than observed.
The rarity of DSFGs and luminous AGN relates to
their intrinsically short duty cycle. If this population is
predominantly short-lived, then it can be used as a con-
straint on the assembly history of galaxy clusters in the
time before virialization. For example, the probability of
observing 10 or more 100 Myr-duration rare galaxies in
one structure is <0.01%. This suggests the phenomenon
is exceedingly rare, and yet there are several multiple
DSFG-rich proto-clusters in only a few square degrees
of data. The existence of these structures provides di-
rect observational evidence that proto-clusters assemble
in short-lived, stochastic bursts that likely correspond to

the collapse of large-scale ﬁlaments on 10 Mpc scales. In
this sense, such episodes represent “events” observed on
the largest scales seen since the imprint of recombination
from the CMB.

An alternate view may be that the gas potential wells
of DSFGs in proto-clusters are much deeper, fueled by an
excess of gas in the surrounding IGM. This point of view
would argue for more long-lived DSFGs.
If this is the
case, then it is more likely that DSFGs in proto-clusters
are triggered at somewhat arbitrary times determined
only by their local <1 Mpc surrounds. As a result, it
is also likely that nearly every observed proto-cluster is
DSFG-rich. The evidence that supports this claim is
our estimate of the volume density to DSFG-rich proto-
clusters and its agreement with the cluster mass function.
If such DSFGs are short-lived, then at most ∼half of
high-z proto-clusters should exhibit an enhanced DSFG-
rich phase.
While diﬀerent threads of evidence support both possi-
ble explanations − short-lived, bursting proto-clusters or
gas-enhanced proto-clusters − measurements of gas de-
pletion times for DSFGs sitting in these structures sug-
gests they are indeed short-lived. Therefore the former
evolutionary scenario is favored, where DSFG-rich struc-
tures represent a short-lived phase of rapid growth across
incredibly large ﬁlaments in the IGM. More observations
of such structures are needed to constrain the overall
population of high-z overdensities, the diversity of their
star-formation histories, and to characterize the galax-
ies within such structures to learn how galaxy growth is
governed by environment.
