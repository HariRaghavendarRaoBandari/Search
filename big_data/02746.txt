We study the propagation of low frequency shallow water waves on a one dimen-
sional ﬂow of varying depth. When taking into account dispersive eﬀects, the linear
propagation of long wavelength modes on uneven bottoms excites new solutions of
the dispersion relation which possess a much shorter wavelength. The peculiarity
is that one of these new solutions has a negative energy. When the ﬂow becomes
supercritical, this mode has been shown to be responsible for the (classical) analog
of the Hawking eﬀect. For subcritical ﬂows, the production of this mode has been
observed numerically and experimentally, but the precise physics governing the scat-
tering remained unclear. In this work, we provide an analytic treatment of this eﬀect
in subcritical ﬂows. We analyze the scattering of low frequency waves using a new
perturbative series, derived from a generalization of the Bremmer series. We show
that the production of short wavelength modes is governed by a complex value of
the position: a complex turning point. Using this method, we investigate various
ﬂow proﬁles, and derive the main characteristics of the induced spectrum.

INTRODUCTION

3

The idea to use ﬂuid ﬂows to mimic the Hawking eﬀect of black holes [1], which allows
them to spontaneously emit a thermal radiation, has been intensively studied at the theoretical
level [2–5]. More recently, several experimental studies have been set up, in various media
as diverse as Bose-Einstein condensates [6, 7], optical ﬁbers [8, 9] or water waves [10–13]. To
obtain such a set up, one needs a ﬂuid ﬂow whose velocity crosses the speed of waves. Moreover,
because the Hawking eﬀect necessarily involves short wavelength modes, it also necessary to
take into account dispersive eﬀects that arise at short distances. One promising possibility is
to use surface waves on ﬂowing water [14, 15], since their propagation speed is much lower than
that of sound waves. When neglecting capillarity and dissipation, surface waves propagate on
a one-dimensional homogeneous ﬂow with a frequency ω and a wave number k that obey the
dispersion relation [16, 17]

Ω2 = gk tanh(hBk),

(1)
where Ω = ω − vk is the co-moving frequency. In this equation, g is the local gravitational
ﬁeld, v the ﬂow velocity, and hB the depth of water. To characterize the ﬂow, it is convenient
to introduce the Froude number, deﬁned as F = v/c, where c = √ghB is the propagation speed
of long wavelength waves. If F > 1 (resp. F < 1), the ﬂow is called ‘supercritical’ (resp. ‘sub-
critical’). The transition from subcritical to supercritical, a ‘transcritical ﬂow’, is the analog of
a black hole if the ﬂow accelerates, and a white hole if the ﬂow decelerates. Unfortunately, it is
experimentally delicate to obtain controllable transcritical ﬂows to study the analog Hawking
radiation. One diﬃculty is caused by the appearance of an undular pattern, or ‘undulation’
that deforms the free surface and whose amplitude raises with the Froude number [16, 18, 19].
Instead, experimental studies have so far focused on ﬂows of high Froude numbers but that stay
subcritical [10–13]. In these cases, due to dispersive eﬀects one still observes the production
of the negative norm mode responsible for the Hawking eﬀect in transcritical ﬂows. However,
theoretical treatments on the analog Hawking eﬀect have mostly focused on transcritical ﬂows,
and it is therefore presently unclear what governs the spectrum of this negative norm mode
production for subcritical ﬂows. Recent numerical works [20–22] have indicated that the spec-
trum is in general quite diﬀerent when the ﬂow is subcritical with respect to the transcritical
case.

played by the variation of the height of the ﬂow, i.e. |h(cid:48)

In this work, we provide an analytical characterization of the low frequency scattering when
the ﬂow is inhomogeneous, i.e. when c, v, and hB depend on the position x. For this, we
developed a new mathematical approach, based on a generalization of the Bremmer series [23–
25]. This allows us to obtain a perturbative expansion of the various scattering coeﬃcients in
gradients of the background. More precisely, the ‘small parameter’ of the expansion will be
B|. The ﬁrst order treatment shows that
the values of the scattering coeﬃcients are mainly governed by complex turning points. At very
low frequencies, all the turning points reduce to a single complex horizon, which is the locus
where the Froude number F (x) reaches 1 if it is analytically continued to complex positions
x. Although we focus in this work on water waves, we believe that our conclusions are still
valid for subcritical ﬂows (or what replaces it) in other analog gravity systems where dispersion
decreases the velocity at short wavelengths, e.g., optical ﬁbers [8, 9], or sound in a duct [26].
The paper is divided as follows. In the ﬁrst section we present the set up and the wave equation.
In the second one, we derive the perturbative series, and show that the ﬁrst order is given in
terms of contour integrals involving the complex turning points. In the last section, we apply
this general framework to speciﬁc ﬂow examples, discuss the various regimes and the relevant
physics for present experiments. In Appendices, we provide very general proofs, preparing our
results for further extensions.

II. THE SETTINGS

A. Surface wave equation

4

We shall consider the propagation of water waves in the so-called ‘weak dispersive regime’.
In this regime, the dispersion relation (1) is approximated by the ﬁrst two terms of the low
k expansion, i.e. k tanh(hBk) ∼ hBk2 − h3
Bk4/3. As mentioned in the introduction, it is
necessary to take into account dispersive eﬀects since the scattering processes we are interested
in involve short wavelength modes. When the maximum value of the Froude number Fmax is
close to 1, a case referred to as ‘near critical ﬂows’, the weak dispersive regime provides a good
approximation of the scattering coeﬃcient. However, we believe that even for ﬂows that are not
near critical, the qualitative features we describe will be very similar. In the weak dispersive
regime, gravity waves are described by the action [19] 1

(2)

In the following, v is assumed to be positive, so that water ﬂows from left to right. The ﬁeld φ
encodes the ﬂuctuations of the velocity potential of the ﬂow at the surface. It is directly related
to the change of height of the free surface. In the presence of a (linear) wave, the water depth
becomes hB(x) + δh(t, x). The surface elevation δh is then given by

δh(t, x) = −

(∂t + v∂x)φ,

(3)

where this follows from Bernouilli’s equation [15, 19]. Minimizing the action (2) gives us the
equation of motion for the ﬁeld

We assume that the background ﬂow is stationary, and therefore, we look for solutions of Eq. (4)
at ﬁxed frequency, i.e. of the form φ = Re (φω(x)e−iωt), where φω(x) is a complex stationary
mode. Since time-dependent solutions are obtained by taking the real part, it is enough to
work with ω > 0. The modes φω(x) satisfy the equation

(5)

Before trying to solve this equation, it is useful to analyze its main properties. As it is derived
from an action, it possesses a canonically conserved norm, given by

(6)

This norm plays a crucial role in the characterization of the scattering. For positive frequency
modes, the sign of the norm coincides with that of the energy. As we shall see, due to dispersion,
the system possesses negative energy modes, or equivalently, modes with a negative norm (6).

1 Notice that there is a small diﬀerence with [19]. There is a change of ordering between ∂x and hB(x) in the
last term. The action of [19] is more accurate, but our choice makes a couple of equations simpler. Moreover,

This is characteristic of unstable ﬂows [27]. The generation of a negative norm mode by
sending a positive norm one is referred to as ‘anomalous scattering’. For transcritical ﬂows, this
scattering (in the smooth limit) is the classical analog of the Hawking eﬀect 2. For subcritical
ﬂows, it is still present, but it was so far unclear what governs the spectrum, i.e., the values of
the scattering coeﬃcients for various frequencies. As we shall deal exclusively with stationary
modes, it is more convenient to work with the conserved current rather than the norm (6).
Because of the dispersive term, this current is not the standard Klein-Gordon current, but has
a more complicated form [28]. Starting from the action (2), it reads

(cid:17)

For any mode solution of (5), the current is (exactly) conserved, i.e. ∂xJ = 0. This current
represents the amount of norm that is transported by a mode. Its conservation is of course
equivalent to that of the norm (6). This can be directly seen from the identity ∂tρ + ∂xJ = 0,
which follows from the application of the Noether theorem to Eq. (2). Notice also that for
ω > 0, ωJ[φω] is the energy current [19].

When the background ﬂow is homogeneous, i.e. c, v, and hB are constant, the solutions are
superpositions of plane waves eikωx. Here, kω is the wave number, or momentum, and satisﬁes
the dispersion relation

(8)

Below a certain threshold frequency ωcrit, this equation possesses 4 distinct roots (see Fig. 1).
Two of them have long wavelengths, while the two others have short wavelengths. The ﬁrst two
are the usual left-mover (noted ku, as it moves against the ﬂow, i.e. ‘upstream’) and right-mover
(noted kd, for ‘downstream’). The two other roots, which are absent when the ﬂow velocity
vanishes, are due to both the nonzero ﬂow and dispersion. One of them, k−, has a positive
value but a negative norm. The other have a negative value and a positive norm, and is denoted
k+. (The index refers to the sign of the norm.) The negative norm mode described by k− will
play a crucial role in the following.

The aim of this work is to study, when the ﬂow becomes inhomogeneous, how these four
modes mix. In particular, we shall see how the propagation of a long wavelength left-mover ku
generates the short wavelength modes, as was experimentally observed in [10, 13]. For ﬂows
that become critical, this generation is the classical analog of the Hawking eﬀect. For subcritical
ﬂows, such a mode conversion still exist, but the law governing the scattering coeﬃcients was
so far not known analytically. This is what we aim at characterizing.

B. Characterization of the background ﬂow

We assume that the ﬂuid ﬂows over a smooth obstacle. The height of ﬂuid hB(x) varies
monotonically from an asymptotic value on the left side, to a minimum value hmin and in-
creases again to a constant value on the right side. When the obstacle is smooth enough, the
(unperturbed) free surface stays approximately ﬂat, and in this case, the other background
quantities are directly deduced from the height by the relations

where g is the local gravitational acceleration, and q the (conserved) ﬂow rate (water ﬂux per

ﬂow is the local value of the Froude number

(10)

where the second equality is satisﬁed when (9) is. In realistic ﬂows, curvature eﬀects (but also
dissipation) will deform the free surface, and the relation between these quantities becomes
more intricate 3. Unless otherwise speciﬁed, we will treat the three functions v, c, and hB
as independent, thereby leaving the possibility to include corrections to Eq. (9). However,
to keep control on the various approximations, we assume that the gradients, in units of the

B|, and we refer to the ‘smooth limit’ as |h(cid:48)

dispersive scale, are essentially of the same order, i.e., that |hBv(cid:48)/v| and |hBc(cid:48)/c| are of the
same order as |h(cid:48)
B| (cid:28) 1. This is automatically
the case if the three functions are related by Eq. (9). Far from the obstacle, we assume that
the background quantities v, c, and hB are constant. Over this obstacle, the ﬂow velocity v
increases to a maximum vmax while the wave speed decreases to a minimum cmin. At the top
of the obstacle, the Froude number reaches its maximum Fmax (see Fig. 2). The assumptions
we make are in practice nontrivial. First it assumes that no turbulence is formed by the ﬂow
close to the free surface. While this is reasonable for subcritical ﬂows, we also assumed that
no undulation appears at the free surface. When increasing the Froude number, even below 1,
such an undulation is more likely to form, as observed in [10, 13]. We believe that the presence

3 In [15], a diﬀerent wave equation was proposed, which takes into account eﬀects from the curvature of the free
surface. Later, the link between this equation and the more familiar (4) was established in [19]. In particular,
it was shown that the corrections due to curvature can be implemented by using the same equation (4), but
where c, v, and hB are related by a more intricate relation than (9), see Eq. (3) therein.

kωk+kdk−kuof such an undulation could be treated by our framework (see the remark of footnote 4), but
the computations will be more involved. We feel that such an analysis goes beyond the scope
of the present paper.

C. The WKB approximation

limit of a very smooth background |h(cid:48)

When v(x), c(x), and hB(x) vary, plane waves are no longer solutions of Eq. (5). In the
B| → 0, solutions of Eq. (5) are given by WKB modes,
i.e., locally plane waves characterized by a local momentum kω(x). This local momentum is a
solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, which is nothing else than the dispersion relation (8)
in an inhomogeneous background

(11)

Each solution of kj of this equation depends on both ω and x. To lighten the notations, we
shall drop this dependance when unnecessary. Throughout this paper, we also assume that the
4 roots are real and distinct for all x. Since the ﬂow stays subcritical all along, i.e. Fmax < 1,
this is realized below a threshold frequency ωmin = minx(ωcrit(x)). For near critical ﬂows, the
value of this frequency reads

,

For ω < ωmin, a WKB mode is then given by

where the subscript j indicates the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi root, i.e. j ∈ {u, +,−, d}.
A careful analysis (see e.g. Appendix A of [29] or Appendix A of this work) shows that in the
limit of smooth backgrounds, the amplitude simply reads

1(cid:112)

Aj =

,

(14)

|Ω(kj)vg(kj)|

F(x)x1FmaxFminFlow8

where vg is the group velocity of the corresponding mode, and Ω its co-moving frequency,
deﬁned after Eq. (1). Moreover, at the level of the WKB approximation, the current J is easy
to compute and one sees that

J[ϕj] = ±1 = sign (Ω(kj)vg(kj)) .

(15)

Hence, the WKB amplitude (14) normalizes the current of a WKB mode to ±1 [28]. This
property of WKB modes comes from the fact that the current J is an adiabatic invariant of the
problem [30]. Unfortunately, the WKB approximation precisely consists in neglecting the mode
mixing, which is what we are after. To overcome this problem, we ﬁrst notice that for ω < ωmin,
no crossing occurs, i.e. the 4 roots of (11) are distinct for all x. Therefore, the 4 WKB modes
in (13) are perfectly well-deﬁned functions of x. Instead of using them as approximate solutions
of the wave equation, we shall use them as a new basis to represent exact solutions of the wave
equation (5). This allows us to recast the wave equation in an equivalent form, adapted to a
perturbative expansion of the scattering coeﬃcients in the background gradients.

III. BEYOND WKB: THE LOCAL SCATTERING COEFFICIENTS

A. The Bremmer representation

The idea to use the WKB modes as a basis has been widely studied and used for second
order diﬀerential equations, where it is called the Bremmer series.
It has a wide range of
applications, from scattering theory of the Schr¨odinger equation [25], to particle production in
early cosmology [31, 32]. Here however, we must use an extended version of this method, as
the problem is intrinsically higher order. As explained in the previous section, the S-matrix
is 4 × 4. In Appendix A, we present detailed proofs of how to extend the Bremmer series for
higher order equations. In this section, we present the method without technical calculation,
in order to focus on the physics and the signiﬁcance of this new representation. The key idea is
to write general, exact solutions of Eq. (5) as superpositions of WKB waves, where the various
amplitudes are x-dependent, i.e.

+ A+(x)ei(cid:82) k+(x(cid:48))dx(cid:48)

+ A−(x)ei(cid:82) k−(x(cid:48))dx(cid:48)

+ Ad(x)ei(cid:82) kd(x(cid:48))dx(cid:48)

φ(x) = Au(x)ei(cid:82) ku(x(cid:48))dx(cid:48)

.

(16)

At this level, the function Aj(x) are unspeciﬁed functions, and are not given by (14). Since
this introduces 4 unknown functions, instead of 1, we impose 3 extra conditions. The idea is to
decompose also the ﬁrst, second and third derivatives of φ(x) on the WKB basis, and the forth
derivative will then be given by the equation of motion (5). Explicitly, we assume, in addition
to (16),

+ kdAdei(cid:82) kd(x(cid:48))dx(cid:48)

Ad(x)ei(cid:82) kd(x(cid:48))dx(cid:48)

Using these 3 conditions and the main ansatz (16), we show that the knowledge of φ(x) is
equivalent to the knowledge of Au(x), A+(x), A−(x) and Ad(x). The 4 equations combine to

where V is the Vandermonde matrix of the 4 roots ku, k+, k−, and kd, i.e.

Because the three roots are distinct, det(V ) (cid:54)= 0, and hence, the relation between φ and its
derivatives and (Au, A+, A−, Ad) is one-to-one. Therefore, the wave equation (5) can now be
entirely recast in an equivalent equation for the local amplitudes Aj(x). To obtain the equation
satisﬁed by the local amplitudes Aj(x), we plug the ansatz (18) in the wave equation (5). Since
the ﬁrst three derivatives of φ are given by (18), we are left with a ﬁrst order equation on the
four amplitudes (Au, A+, A−, Ad) (see App. A 1). This equation has the form

∂xAj = (cid:102)Mjj(x)Aj +

(cid:102)Mj(cid:96)(x)ei(cid:82) (k(cid:96)(x(cid:48))−kj (x(cid:48)))dx(cid:48)

A(cid:96).

(cid:88)

(cid:96)(cid:54)=j

The oﬀ-diagonal elements of (cid:102)M are easy to interpret: they give the coupling between the dif-

ferent WKB branches, due to the varying background. Those are responsible for the nontrivial
scattering. On the other hand, the diagonal terms of Eq. (20) represent the adiabatic evolution
of the amplitudes Aj(x). To further simplify the equation, we can integrate these diagonal
terms by working with normalized amplitudes. For this, we deﬁne

(20)

where Nj is chosen so that the ﬁrst term of (20) disappears. This gives a ﬁrst order equation
on Nj, which directly integrate as Nj = exp
. As we show in App. A 2 and B,
this leads to

Aj(x) = aj(x)Nj(x),

|Ω(kj)vg(kj)|

Nj =

(19)

(21)

(22)

We recognize here nothing else than the WKB amplitude given in Eq. (14). This is not a
surprise, as Nj gives the adiabatic evolution of the amplitudes. We shall refer to these new co-
eﬃcients aj(x) as the local scattering coeﬃcients. At the level of the WKB approximation, they
are constant. When the background varies, these coeﬃcients becomes non constant, meaning
that the propagation of one mode excites the other ones, leading to nontrivial asymptotic scat-
tering coeﬃcients. These coeﬃcients are governed by a ﬁrst order equation, directly obtained
from (20), and which reads

(cid:88)

(cid:96)(cid:54)=j

Mj(cid:96)(x)ei(cid:82) (k(cid:96)(x(cid:48))−kj (x(cid:48)))dx(cid:48)

∂xaj =

a(cid:96).

(23)

This equation possesses several key features, that we now wish to underline. First, this equation
is strictly equivalent to the original equation (5). No approximation have been used so far, but
this rewriting is very adapted to a perturbative resolution. Second, the coupling coeﬃcients
Mj(cid:96) are proportional to derivatives of the background. In the limit |h(cid:48)
B| (cid:28) 1, they are small
the coeﬃcients aj mainly couple through the change of their WKB phases ei(cid:82) (k(cid:96)(x(cid:48))−kj (x(cid:48)))dx(cid:48)
and have a slowly varying phase (see App. A 2 for their exact expressions). Because of this,
.
This structure implies that the scattering will become signiﬁcant when this phase diﬀerence
satisﬁes a resonance condition (see next section). The last key property of Eq. (23) is obtained
when computing the conserved current (7) in terms of the local scattering coeﬃcients. Since J
involves only the ﬁrst three derivatives of φ, the ansatz (18) guarantees that the computation

of J is identical as in the case of plane waves. After some eﬀorts (shown in App. B 3), we show
that

10

(24)

J = −|au(x)|2 + |a+(x)|2 − |a−(x)|2 + |ad(x)|2 = const.

Once again, this equation is exact.
It guarantees that the scattering governed by Eq. (23)
conserves the norm of Eq. (6). Also, from Eq. (23), the conservation of the current implies that
the matrix M has some symmetric/antisymmetric properties, something that is not transparent
from their explicit expressions (given in App. A 2).

B. The complex turning points

We now turn to the evaluation of the scattering coeﬃcients in the limit of smooth back-
grounds |h(cid:48)
B| (cid:28) 1. Since 4 modes exist on both sides, there are 4 incoming legs and 4 outgoing
ones, and the complete S-matrix is 4× 4. In a quantum mechanical language, the scattering co-
eﬃcients can be seen as transition amplitudes for a mode transition k(cid:96) → kj. These transitions
in an expansion in the matrix
can then be estimated in perturbation theory of Eq. (23), i.e.
elements M(cid:96)j, which are small in smooth backgrounds |h(cid:48)
B| (cid:28) 1. For the present purpose, we
shall consider only one speciﬁc scattering mode, but our results easily extends to the others. We
consider a long wavelength mode coming in from the right, which means that au(+∞) = 1, and
a+(−∞) = a−(−∞) = ad(−∞) = 0 (see Fig. 3). This ﬁxes half of the asymptotic values of the
local scattering coeﬃcients. The other half gives the scattering coeﬃcients (see Fig. 3). T and
R are the transmission and reﬂection coeﬃcients between the two long wavelength modes, while
α and β describe the generation of the short wavelength modes. Using (24), the conservation
of the current imposes the following relation between the scattering coeﬃcients

|T|2 + |R|2 + |α|2 − |β|2 = 1.
We see that the coeﬃcient β contributes with the unusual sign.

(25)

Figure 3: Space-time picture of the scattering. Far from the obstacle, the background ﬂow becomes
constant and the solution reduces to a superposition of plane waves. The asymptotic values of the
local scattering coeﬃcients give the (global) scattering coeﬃcients, i.e. au(−∞) = T , a+(+∞) = α,
a(+∞) = β, and ad(+∞) = R.

At zeroth order in M, au(x) ∼ 1, while the other aj(x) vanish. When inserting this on the
right hand side of (23), and integrating from −∞ to +∞, we obtain the ﬁrst order expression

TαβObstacleΩ<0Ω>0Ω>0Ω>0R1Ω>0txin M of the scattering coeﬃcients. At this order, T is 1, while the other three are given by an
integral expression. To start, we focus on the computation of α. By solving Eq. (23) at leading
order, only the coeﬃcient M+u contributes and we have

(cid:90) +∞
−∞ M+u(x)ei(cid:82) (ku(x(cid:48))−k+(x(cid:48)))dx(cid:48)

(26)

11

This gives the ﬁrst order expression for the coeﬃcient α. It is possible, starting from Eq. (23) to
derive an expression for α at any order in M. In the case of the Schr¨odinger equation, it has been
shown that the obtained series is generally convergent [33], and that the convergence is usually
quite fast [25, 34]. In Fig. 4, we give a diagrammatic representation of the perturbative series.
In a regime where the various scattering coeﬃcients are small, |α| (cid:28) 1, |β| (cid:28) 1, and |R| (cid:28) 1,
it is legitimate to truncate this series at ﬁrst order, since higher orders will be essentially given
by higher products in these quantities. This is true in the smooth limit |h(cid:48)
B| (cid:28) 1, but we also
need ω to be suﬃciently far from ωmin, otherwise we would have |α| = O(1) (although ωmin − ω
might in practice be quite small and |α| (cid:28) 1 still valid, see e.g. Fig. 5(a)). We now assume
that this is the case, and study the consequence of the ﬁrst order result (26).

Figure 4: Diagrammatic representation of the perturbative resolution of Eq. (23) for the transition
ku → k+, i.e., the coeﬃcient α. The dashed lines symbolize the fact that the various modes interact
through the background, i.e. through v(cid:48), c(cid:48), and h(cid:48)
B. The expressions we provide in this section III B
are at ﬁrst order O(M).

The main contribution of the integral governing Eq. (26) comes from the saddle point of the

exponential. This saddle point satisﬁes the equation

ku(x∗) − k+(x∗) = 0.

(27)

By assumption, this equation is not veriﬁed by any real x. However, when the background

functions are analytic, there exist complex solutions x∗ ∈ C. If x∗ were real, it would correspond
to a turning point, and hence in our case we call x∗ a complex turning point. Decomposing it
in real and imaginary parts,

(28)

It follows from (26) that the α coeﬃcient is given by the contribution of the saddle point as

x∗ = xαR + i∆α.

where C is a constant prefactor (discussed below). In Eq. (29), x0 is a real reference point,
which can be chosen anywhere. If several turning points are present, α is given by a sum of the
contribution (29) for each of them. Usually, the ones that are the closest to the real axis give the
dominant contributions, while the others produce only exponentially small corrections 4. As we
shall see in Sec. IV B 2, very symmetric ﬂows typically have two main interfering contributions
to the scattering coeﬃcients. Taking the modulus of (29), we have

As explained in App. A 3, the complex turning point must be chosen such that the contour
integral in (30) has a positive imaginary part. It follows that α is generally exponentially small,
which is a common feature of low gradients or adiabatic limits [25, 35]. The prefactor C in
B| → 0, we show that it tends to 1
(see App. A 3). However, this limit fails at reproducing the ultra low frequency behavior of the

the gradients are nonzero but small, in the limit ω → 0, the prefactor vanishes as

|C|2 ∼

,

(31)

as we show in App. B 2. The characteristic frequency ωs is estimated in Eq. (B14). The key
point is that ωs is proportional to |h(cid:48)
B|, and hence becomes very small in the smooth limit,
and in particular, ωs (cid:28) ωmin (ωmin deﬁned in Eq. (12)). To summarize, the prefactor C is
characterized by two regimes. When ωs (cid:28) ω (cid:46) ωmin it is 1, but for ω (cid:28) ωs it is given by
(cid:32)
Eq. (31). A similar computation for β leads to a similar expression,

(32)

The complex turning point for β is a priori diﬀerent from that of α, since it obeys a diﬀerent
resonance condition ku(xβ∗ ) − k−(xβ∗ ) = 0.
In App. B 2 we show that when ωs (cid:28) ωmin, the
prefactor is essentially the same as for α. As we see from (30) and (32), in the smooth limit,
the scattering coeﬃcients are exponentially small.

The last coeﬃcient R, giving the mode mixing between the two long wavelength modes (see
Fig. 3), can also be evaluated perturbatively, and possesses a contour integral expression as
(30) and (32) involving a diﬀerent complex turning point xR∗ . The ﬁrst order expression of R is
however more delicate. Indeed, for very low frequencies, this ﬁrst order expression becomes of
order 1, meaning the the perturbative treatment breaks down. On the contrary, the expressions
for α and β stay small in the limit ω → 0. The reason for this discrepancy can be seen in
the expressions of the matrix elements of M. While Mdu is proportional to the background
gradients |h(cid:48)
B|, M+u and M−u are further suppressed by a factor O(ω1/2). Heuristically, we
explain this by the fact that R governs a transition involving only long wavelength modes,
while α and β involve a short wavelength one, which improves the accuracy of the perturbative
treatment even at low frequencies ω (cid:28) ωmin. Fortunately, it has been numerically obtained in

4 In the presence of an undulation in the background, we believe that a series of turning points, corresponding
to the bumps of the undulation, will contribute to the scattering coeﬃcients. Hence, these should be radically
reduced or increased depending on whether the transition ‘resonates’ with the undulation. We believe that
this point deserves further studies.

13

various works [21, 22, 36] that the reﬂection coeﬃcient R stays small for all frequencies. Since
we are mainly interested in the production of short wavelength modes by ku, we shall ignore
the mode kd in the sequel. Note that to obtain second order estimates of α and β, kd can no
longer be ignored since it will appear as an intermediate state in the transitions ku → k+ or
ku → k− (see Fig. 4).

IV. APPLICATION TO NEAR CRITICAL FLOWS

A. The simplest example: case of a ‘short obstacle’

We shall start by analyzing a simple example. This will allow us to present the techniques
to explicitly evaluate Eq. (30), in a case where the computations stay relatively simple. For
this we assume that the mode mixing essentially takes place in a close vicinity of the top of
the obstacle, i.e., where Fmax is reached. In Sec. IV B 2 we will give a more precise meaning to
this ‘short obstacle limit’. Under this assumption, the evolution of the Froude number is well
approximated by a second order Taylor expansion near its maximum

1 − F (x) (cid:39) 1 − Fmax +

(x/d)2.

1
2

(33)

The parameter d characterizes the length of variation of the Froude number near its maximum
value. As we shall see, this quantity directly aﬀects the scattering coeﬃcient. In addition, to
simplify the discussion, we present the results in two steps depending on the ratio ω/ωmin (but
without assuming anything concerning the ratio ω/ωs). We ﬁrst study the limit ω/ωmin (cid:28) 1,
and in a second part, study the corrections in ω/ωmin.

1. Low frequency limit

to

In the limit ω (cid:28) ωmin, the resonance conditions for α and β become the same, and reduce
(34)

1 − F (x∗) = 0.

Since this condition gives the location of the horizon when the ﬂow is transcritical, for low
frequencies, the complex turning point can be interpreted as a complex horizon. Using the
proﬁle of Eq. (33), it is given by

(cid:112)

x∗ = ±id

2(1 − Fmax) = ±i∆0.

To obtain the correct sign of the integral in Eq. (30), we must choose Im(x∗) > 0. Moreover,
when ω → 0, the roots of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation (11) become simpler, and we ﬁnd

ku(x) − k+(x) =

1

hB(x)

3(1 − F 2(x)).

We notice here that the root diﬀerence (36) scales like (1 − F )1/2. Therefore, in the limit
1 − Fmax (cid:28) 1, it is only necessary to consider the variations of the function 1 − F (x). The
other background quantities can be approximated by their value near Fmax, since taking into
account extra terms will produce subleading corrections in 1 − Fmax. In this limit, the proﬁle
of Eq. (33) gives

where α0 is short for αω(cid:28)ωmin. We see that in the regime ω (cid:28) ωmin, all the frequency dependence
is in the prefactor Cω (we added the index ω with respect to Eq. (30) to emphasize this point).
Since we assume nothing concerning the ratio ω/ωs, Cω varies from 1 to ω/ωs when ω decreases.
By a similar computation, we show that β0 has the same amplitude for very low frequencies,
|βω→0|2 ∼ |αω→0|2. This can be seen by direct computation, but comes in fact from a
i.e.
more general property of the mode equation. Indeed, the change φω → (φ−ω)∗ leave the mode
equation (5) invariant, and as can be seen by looking at the roots of (11), exchanges the role
of α and β. This leads to the relation

βω = α

∗
−ω.

(40)

The property above has been widely used in Hawking radiation studies [3, 29, 37]. Here also,
it signiﬁcantly simpliﬁes the computations of the scattering coeﬃcients.

2. Frequency dependence

The corrections to Eq. (39) in ω/ωmin are more delicate to obtain. These corrections have
two origins. The ﬁrst is the shift of the value of the complex turning point, and the second
is the exact expression of the roots ku, k+, and k−. For the latter, one needs to solve the
Hamilton-Jacobi equation (11). Unfortunately, one cannot simply compute the corrections to
Eq. (36) for ω (cid:28) ωmin because such corrections will not be accurate close to the turning point.
We can still simplify Eq. (11) by discarding the last root kd, which plays essentially no role
at ﬁrst order in perturbation theory. The Hamilton-Jacobi equation (11) is then reduced to a
third order equation in k. To obtain it, we carefully take the square root of (11) so as to select
the relevant branch (see Fig. 1), and expand the result up to O(k3). This gives

ω = −c(1 − F )k +

ch2

k3.

(41)

A direct comparison of this equation with Eq. (11) shows that the three roots ku, k+, and k−
are approximated by the roots of (41) up to small corrections in 1 − F (cid:28) 1 5. We now obtain

5 To see this, we ﬁrst notice that since we performed an expansion in k, the highest error made is on the value

Similarly to Eq. (36), at leading order in 1− Fmax, it is only necessary to consider the variations

or more quickly, carefully apply Eq. (40). The results are presented on Fig. 5(a). Since the

As we observe on Fig. 5(a), the low frequency expressions Eq. (51) are quite accurate up to
ω (cid:46) ωmin (where the perturbative expression (30) can no longer be trusted). At this level we
would like to emphasize several qualitative features displayed by Eq. (51) that are maintained
for more general proﬁles. First, when ω → 0, |αω|2 ∼ |βω|2 and both vanish as O(ω) due to
the prefactor (see Eq. (31)). Second, when ω/ωmin increases, |αω|2 becomes larger than |βω|2.
Third, the corrections in ω/ωmin display non-analytic terms, in O(ω ln(ω)).
It is also quite instructive to analyse the behavior the the ratio rω = |βω/αω|2. Indeed, the
linearity of the logarithm of this ratio in ω has been used in the literature as a sign for the
thermality of the emitted spectrum. Moreover, this ratio is also independent of the prefactor
Cω. For low frequencies, Eq. (51) gives

ln(rω) ∼ −

(cid:33)

On Fig. 5(b), we plotted the evolution of rω, both using Eq. (49) and the low frequency
expression (52). As we see, despite the presence of non-analytic corrections, rω looks fairly
linear in ω. However, this ratio alone misses several features of the scattering that diﬀers from
the Hawking regime, and in particular the low frequency ω (cid:28) ωmin behavior of α and β.

B. A general class of ﬂow proﬁles

1. Monotonic proﬁles

We shall start by analyzing the case of a proﬁle whose Froude number, increase monotonically
from a minimum to a maximum value. This case is very useful to better understand the more
general proﬁles of Sec. IV B 2, but it also has its interests in its own right. To model such a
proﬁle, we assume that the Froude number is given by

(cid:16) γx

(cid:17)

D

F (x) = F0 + D tanh

.

(53)

The ﬂow starts from a low Froude number Fmin = F0 − D on the left side, and smoothly rises
to reach Fmax = F0 + D. The parameter γ gives the slope of the proﬁle. As in the preceding
section, it is simpler to ﬁrst look at the low frequency limit ω (cid:28) ωmin and in a second time
discuss the corrections in ω/ωmin. At low frequencies, the physics is dictated by the complex

for ω (cid:28) ωs,
The prefactor Cω is given by Eq. (B15). We clearly observe three distinct regimes:
|αω|2 ∼ |βω|2 ∝ ω, for ωs (cid:28) ω (cid:28) ωmin, |αω|2 ∼ |βω|2 almost constant in ω, and for ωs (cid:28) ω (cid:46) ωmin,
|αω|2 increases, while |βω|2 decreases. Right panel (b): Ratio rω as a function of ω. In both plots, we

(55)

We see that the value of the coeﬃcient depends not only on the slope γ, but also on the height
of the step, i.e. the parameter D. Moreover, we notice that it depends on 1 − Fmax with a
diﬀerent power law than in the short obstacle case (compare (55) to (39)). The reason for this
is that unlike in the short obstacle case, the imaginary part of the complex horizon of (54) is
independent of 1 − Fmax, hence α0 depends on it only through the roots ku − k+. To obtain
the corrections for ω (cid:54)= 0, we follow the same procedure as in Sec. IV A 2, and compute only

6 There is in fact a discrete periodic set, with imaginary parts that are odd multiples of the one of (54). We
keep here only the one closest to the real axis, which gives the dominant contribution. There are also poles
located at i(2n + 1)πD/2γ, but a direct (similar to App. B 4) calculation of the corresponding contributions
shows that they are subdominant with respect to the complex horizon (54).

We notice that unlike in (51), the above equation shows no non-analytic terms. This turns
out to be an accident of the proﬁle of Eq. (53), where the leading order non-analytic terms (in
O(ω ln(ω))) contributes only to the phase of αω. This is no longer true for the next-to-leading
corrections in ω/ωmin or if the proﬁle slightly diﬀers from (53).

2. Non-monotonic proﬁles

We are now ready to analyze a more general class of ﬂow proﬁle, which have a similar shape
than the ones studied numerically and experimentally [10, 13, 21, 22] (undulation excluded).
For this we assume that the Froude number is given by

(cid:18) γl(x + L/2)

(cid:19)

(cid:18) γr(x − L/2)

(cid:19)

(57)

The maximum value of the Froude number Fmax is by assumption smaller than 1. The ﬂow
starts from a low Froude number Fmin = F0 − D on the left side, rises to reach Fmax and
then decreases again to Fmin. On the left side (resp. right side), the slope is controlled by
the parameter γl (resp. γr). Again, we ﬁrst consider the low frequency limit ω (cid:28) ωmin and
then discuss the corrections in ω/ωmin (cid:54)= 0. Depending on the parameters of the proﬁle, we
distinguish three diﬀerent regimes:

• long obstacles γl,rL (cid:29) 1, asymmetric γl (cid:54)= γr,
• long obstacles γl,rL (cid:29) 1, symmetric γl = γr,
• short obstacles γl,rL (cid:28) 1.

When the obstacle is long (L is large), there exist two complex horizons, located around the
top of each slopes. In the limit γl,rL (cid:29) 1, they are given by the monotonic proﬁle expression
(54) centered at ±L/2, i.e.

The scattering coeﬃcients are then given by a sum of two interfering contributions

the proﬁle is asymmetric, γl (cid:54)= γr, the one with the biggest slope dominates in the expression
for |αω|2. Indeed, the imaginary part of the corresponding turning point lies closer to the real
axis, as it is inversely proportional to γl,r. On the contrary, if the ﬂow is symmetric, γl = γr,
the two contributions have the same weight and interfere through the phase of Eq. (59). This
phase shift is accumulated not only along the real line, between xlR and xrR, but also in the
complex plane, from xl,r
R to xl,r∗ . For a long obstacle (γl,rL (cid:29) 1) and ω (cid:28) ωmin, the phase shift

where ζl,r are deﬁned after Eq. (B34). When decreasing L, the two complex horizons keep
the same imaginary part, but their real part get closer. At a certain critical value L = Lc,
they merge into a single solution 7. For lower values L < Lc, one of the solutions migrates
closer to the real axis, while the other moves afar. If the proﬁle is not perfectly symmetric,
one observes something similar, but instead of merging together, the roots ﬁrst get closer, and
around the critical value of L, repel each other so that the one with the smallest imaginary
part approaches the real axis, while the other moves afar (see Fig. 6). This mechanism is very
similar to the “avoided crossing”, well-known in quantum mechanics [38]. When L < Lc, we
enter in the regime of a ‘short obstacle’. In this case, one of the complex horizons dominates
in the expression (59) for α. This solution has a real part close (equal if γl = γr) to zero, i.e.,
it lies close to the top of the obstacle. This case becomes very similar to the one studied in
Sec. IV A. At L = 0, the complex horizon closest to the real axis is found to be

(61)

If we additionally have 1− Fmax (cid:28) 1− Fmin, (61) exactly reduces to the ‘short obstacle’ case of
Sec. IV A, meaning that Eq. (33) becomes a good approximation to describe the scattering.

Figure 6: Evolution of the two complex horizons solutions of (34) for the proﬁle (57) as L varies. The
proﬁle is slightly asymmetric: γl = 0.3D and γr = 0.25D, hence in the long obstacle limit, i.e. large
L, one of them lies closer to the real axis. The other parameters of the ﬂow (57) are F0 = 0.71, and
D = 0.17.

When relaxing the assumption ω (cid:28) ωmin, αω and βω diﬀer but are still given by an interfering
sum as in Eq. (59). As ω increases, the two turning points xα∗ and xβ∗ emerge from x0∗ and migrate

in diﬀerent directions in the complex plane. The eﬀect of this migration is twofold. First, for
long obstacles, the relative location of the left and right turning point changes, and therefore,
the phase (60) between the two interfering contributions in Eq. (59) varies. For some values of
the frequency, this phase will be a multiple of 2π, and the coeﬃcients show a dip, as the ﬁrst
order estimate in Eq. (59) vanishes. Such dips have been numerically observed in [21]. Second,
the amplitudes of the single turning point contributions, i.e. |αl| and |αr| (resp. |βl| and |βr|
for βω) are altered as in Eq. (56). On Fig. 7, we represented the evaluation of αω and βω for
a symmetric and an asymmetric proﬁle. On Fig. 8, we show how the coeﬃcients oscillate in
ω due to interferences between the two turning points as in Eq. (59), and how this aﬀects the
ratio rω.

As in Eqs. (51) and (56), we have taken into account the leading corrections in ω/ωmin. We work in
units where g = q = 1 and assume that Eq. (9) holds for simplicity. The parameters of the ﬂow (57)
are F0 = 0.71, D = 0.17 and L = 20. With these parameters, ln(ωs/ωmin) (cid:39) −1.4. The prefactor Cω
is given by Eq. (B15). Left panel (a): symmetric proﬁle, γl = γr = 0.3D. Right panel (b): asymmetric
proﬁle, γl = 0.3D and γr = 0.25D. As we see, a small asymmetry quickly reduces the interference
eﬀects.

V. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we studied the scattering of low frequency waves on a subcritical ﬂuid ﬂow,
that is, whose Froude number stays below 1. We developed a new method, based on a gener-
alization of the Bremmer series, where exact solutions of the wave equation are written as a
local superposition of WKB modes (see Eq. (16)). The coeﬃcients of this superposition, which
we called local scattering coeﬃcients, are position dependent and possess several useful prop-
erties. First, they are by construction slowly varying. At some locations along the ﬂow, they
can transit from one constant value to another. This can be interpreted as the creation of a
new mode. Second, their asymptotic values directly give the scattering coeﬃcients. Third, the
local scattering coeﬃcients are governed by a ﬁrst order diﬀerential equation, Eq. (23), which

We see that when the obstacle becomes asymmetric, the ratio becomes fairly linear, as in the case
exposed in Fig. 5(b). The other parameters of the ﬂow (57) are F0 = 0.71, D = 0.17 and L = 25.

is equivalent to the original wave equation and is adapted to a perturbative treatment at low

gradients, i.e. |h(cid:48)

B| (cid:28) 1.

In Sec. III B, we expose the ﬁrst order perturbative results of this series. We show that
the coeﬃcients are mainly governed by complex turning points, corresponding to the locations
where two roots of the dispersion relation (11) merge when these are analytically continued in
the complex plane. In general, there exist many turning points in the complex plane. Impor-
tantly, the ones closest to the real axis dominate while the others contribute as exponentially
small corrections. Hence the scattering coeﬃcients are governed by a few dominating contri-
butions, taking the form of complex exponentials of contour integrals from the real line to the
complex turning points, see Eqs. (30), and (32).

We then applied these results to a large class of ﬂow proﬁles, so as to extract the generic
features of the scattering coeﬃcients α and β. By studying the behavior of the scattering
coeﬃcients as a function of the frequency ω, we distinguish three main regimes. For ultra-low
frequencies, ω (cid:28) ωs, |α|2 and |β|2 both vanish linearly in ω, see Eq. (31). For intermediate
frequencies ωs (cid:28) ω (cid:28) ωmin, |α|2 and |β|2 share a constant value as in Eq. (39), and when
ω/ωmin becomes signiﬁcant, they start drifting apart as shown by Eq. (51). When they do, |β|2
is generically smaller than |α|2. Moreover, we show in Sec. IV B 2 that long obstacles generally
produce two dominating complex turning points. If the obstacle is symmetric enough, these
two contributions give rise to oscillations in |α|2 and |β|2 due to interferences, as illustrated in
Figs. 7, and 8. All these features are in perfect agreement with what have been previously ob-
served numerically in [20–22] and are complemented by analytic predictions for the parameters
governing the various regimes.

In all, this analysis describes in detail what is the “imprint” of Hawking radiation when the
ﬂow accelerates but stays subcritical. The physics of the Hawking eﬀect is dictated by horizons,

ln(!=!min)00.20.40.60.81ln(j,!j2)-14-12-10-8-6-4-202ln(!=!min)00.20.40.60.81ln(r!)-10-8-6-4-20222

and we have shown here that its imprint in subcritical ﬂows is governed by complex turning
points. In this regime, the spectrum becomes more complicated, as it is governed by nonlocal
quantities. The study of complex turning points allowed us to provide a simple characterization
of this spectrum. When increasing the Froude number, these turning points get closer to the
real axis, until they reach it. Before they do, the present treatment breaks down, but it is
expected that for increasing F the spectrum will smoothly change from the subcritical one to
the Hawking one when F is suﬃciently larger than 1. In the Hawking regime, the characteristic
length of non-locality becomes smaller than the characteristic length of the gradients [5], and
as a result, the spectrum becomes entirely governed by the surface gravity, i.e. the gradient of
the Froude number at the horizon. The analytical study of this transition will be the aim of
future investigations.

Appendix A: Generalized Bremmer series

1. Bremmer series for equations of order N

23

In this appendix, we derive the equation satisﬁed by the local scattering coeﬃcients deﬁned in
Sec. III A. The method we present is a generalization of the Bremmer series [23, 24, 32]. Whereas
the Bremmer series deals with second order diﬀerential equations, such as the Schr¨odinger
equation, we consider higher order diﬀerential equations. This is essential to describe dispersive
eﬀects of wave propagation, as in our case. Higher order diﬀerential operators are also useful
to study Schr¨odinger types of equation in momentum representation, see e.g. [39–41]. Our
method also bears many similarities with the adiabatic series used in a wide variety of contexts,
such as electronic transitions in molecular collisions [35] or particle creation in cosmology [31].
However, here the corresponding operator is not self-adjoint. Under certain conditions, there
exists a quadratic conserved quantity, but it has no reason to be positive deﬁnite. This is the
case for the wave equation of surface waves, see Eq. (24).

To understand the general structure behind this method, we ﬁrst present it for a general
diﬀerential equation of degree N , and then apply it to the surface wave equation (5) (App. B).
We consider the diﬀerential equation

(−i∂x)N φ(x) −

fn(x)(−i∂x)nφ(x) − i

gn(x)(−i∂x)nφ(x) = 0.

(A1)

Here, the functions fn(x) are assumed to be real while the gn(x) can be complex. To this
equation, we associate the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi equation

PHJ(k) = kN −

fn(x)kn = 0,

(A2)

where we introduced the Hamilton-Jacobi polynomial PHJ. We see that the gn’s do not appear
in the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. The reason is that while the fn’s represent the background as
perceived by the ﬁeld φ(x), the gn’s represent the features of the wave equation that are absent
of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. In other words, they encode the possible orderings one can
choose when promoting k in (A2) as the operator −i∂x to obtain (A1). Hence, in the method
we shall present, we treat the gn’s as small quantities, as the same order as the gradients of
the background, i.e. the f(cid:48)
n’s. Going back to (A2), since PHJ is a polynomial of degree N , it
has N diﬀerent roots. The key assumption of the following derivation, is that for all x, the N
roots are real and distinct. In particular, no crossing, where one would have kj(x) = k(cid:96)(cid:54)=j(x) for
some x, occurs. A common procedure with higher order ODEs is to trade the scalar equation
of degree N (A1) for a vectorial equation of degree 1. For this, we gather φ and its derivatives
in a column vector

C(x) is the N × N companion matrix associated with the polynomial PHJ. The key idea of the
Bremmer approach is to ‘locally diagonalize C(x)’, i.e. at ﬁxed x, and then use the eigen-basis
to rewrite the original equation (A1). The characteristic polynomial of C is simply PHJ, and
therefore the roots of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation are the eigen-values of C. Hence, we write
our ﬁeld, solution of (A1), as

where the phases are the primitive integral of the Hamilton-Jacobi roots, i.e.

Since this introduces N new unknown functions (Aj)j=1..N instead of one, we further impose a
similar relation between all derivatives of φ in Φ and the local scattering coeﬃcients Aj. We
deﬁne the Aj such that

Φ(x) = V ·

where V is the Vandermonde matrix of the N roots kj, i.e.

j<i(ki − kj) (cid:54)= 0, and the correspondance (A8)
between Φ and the Aj’s is one-to-one. Physically, Eq. (A8) means that the N−1 ﬁrst derivatives
of φ act as if the Aj(x) were constant. We cannot impose this to the N -th derivative, since the
ﬁeld must be a solution of the wave equation (A1). This last condition will instead give us a
diﬀerential equation satisﬁed by the Aj(x). To obtain it, we ﬁrst notice that the Vandermonde
matrix V is the diagonalizing matrix of the companion matrix C. Indeed, it is rather easy to
check that

We now have enough material to rewrite the mode equation (A1) in a simple manner. For this,
we start by deriving the deﬁnition of the local scattering coeﬃcients (A8)

This form is still not well suited for a perturbative resolution. What we want is to partially
integrate this equation by normalizing the local scattering coeﬃcients. We deﬁne the normalized
coeﬃcients Aj = Njaj. The prefactors Nj are chosen in order to get rid of the diagonal

elements in the matrix of Eq. (A11). This will recast the equation governing the local scattering
coeﬃcients into

(A12)
where the diagonal elements of M are 0. This guarantees that at 0-th order, one recovers the
WKB approximation, i.e. the local scattering coeﬃcients are constant. Inserting Aj = Njaj in
Eq. (A11), we get the condition for the prefactors

2. Computation of the M-matrix elements and prefactors Nj

To analyze the various coeﬃcients of the M-matrix, we will ﬁrst explicitly integrate the
equation for the prefactors Nk in (A13). For this we ﬁrst need to compute the matrix V −1. To
do so, we introduce N reduced polynomials Pj such that PHJ(k) = (k − kj)Pj(k), i.e.

(cid:89)

(cid:96)(cid:54)=j

(k − k(cid:96)) =

(cid:96) k(cid:96)−1.

(A14)

(A15)

(A16)

(A17)

Using them, the coeﬃcients of V −1 are easily expressed as

−1](cid:96)j =

[V

α (cid:96)
j

P(cid:96)(k(cid:96))

.

The coeﬃcients αj
(cid:96) are symmetric polynomials of the N − 1 roots k(cid:96)(cid:54)=j. Their exact expression
is rather involved, however, for our present purpose, it is not necessary to write them explicitly.
Indeed, using (A17), a direct computation gives

−1∂xV ](cid:96)j =

[V

P (cid:48)
(cid:96)(kj)∂xkj
P(cid:96)(k(cid:96))

,

(A18)

where the (cid:48) denotes derivative with respect to k. Moreover, since PHJ(k) = (k − kj)Pj(k), the
derivatives of Pj can be expressed as derivatives of PHJ. In particular, the diagonal term of
V −1∂xV reads

−1∂xV ]jj =

[V

P (cid:48)(cid:48)
HJ(kj)∂xkj
2P (cid:48)

HJ(kj)

.

(A19)

At this level, it is tempting to identify the right-hand side of this equation as the logarithmic
derivative of P (cid:48)
HJ(kj) depends on
x through both the root kj and the coeﬃcients of P (cid:48)
HJ(k), i.e. the fn(x) of Eq. (A2). To go

HJ(kj). However, one should not forget that the expression P (cid:48)

further, we must take into account the contribution of the D-matrix of Eq. (A5). To easily
express the coeﬃcients of V −1DV , we introduce the new polynomial

Using it, the combination of (A17) and (A5) shows that

j=0

Therefore, the prefactor equation (A13) rewrites

If the polynomial Q has the good form, this equation directly integrates. Moreover, we recall
that unlike PHJ, Q might be complex. While its real part contributes to the amplitude of the
prefactor, its imaginary part generates a phase. We call the equation (A1) ‘λ-canonical’, if
there exist a function λ(x) > 0 such that

The phase shift that appears might directly aﬀect the scattering coeﬃcients, e.g., by altering
the resonance condition (27). However, in our case this term stays negligible. We now turn to
the computation of the matrix elements M(cid:96)j(x). For this, we ﬁrst express Eq. (A18) in terms
of the Hamilton-Jacobi polynomial, and obtain

(A15) becomes

3. Scattering coeﬃcients in the smooth limit

At this level, we point out that the equation governing the local scattering coeﬃcients, i.e.
(A14), is fully equivalent to the initial wave equation (A1). No approximation has been made so
far. However, (A14) gives a simple perturbative method to compute the scattering coeﬃcients
in the limit of slowly varying backgrounds. At ﬁrst order, (A14) shows that the scattering
coeﬃcient describing the transition from the mode j to (cid:96) is given by

(cid:90) +∞
−∞ M(cid:96)j(x)ei(cid:82) (kj−k(cid:96))dx(cid:48)

(A27)

Interestingly, in the smooth limit, that is when f(cid:48)

behavior. To compute the integral (A27), we make a change of variable S = (cid:82) (kj − k(cid:96))dx(cid:48).

n → 0 and gn → 0, αj→(cid:96) has a universal
Since no crossing occurs on the real line (by assumption), ∂xS = kj(x) − k(cid:96)(x) (cid:54)= 0, and our
change of variable is licit. Eq. (A27) becomes

This integral can now be evaluated by a residue theorem. All we need to do is to pick up the
contribution of all the singularities of the integrand such that Im(S) > 0. αj→(cid:96) is then given
by

The main type of singularity would be a zero of kj − k(cid:96), which is exactly a saddle point
S∗ = S(x∗). Another type of singularity could arise if one of the background functions fn(x)
has a pole in the complex plane. This second type of singularity usually gives subdominant
contribution, as is the case in all the proﬁles considered in this paper. We shall thus consider
the contributions of saddle points only. For this, one should obtain the corresponding residue.
Close to the saddle point x ∼ x∗, we have k(cid:96) ∼ k∗ − δk(x), and kj ∼ k∗ + δk(x), and hence

M(cid:96)j ∼

(A30)

To obtain this equation, we have neglected the contribution of the Q-term in Eq. (A26), but
a (rather nontrivial) computation shows that it produces subdominant corrections in O(|h(cid:48)
B|).
Then, using the fact that δk ∝ (x − x∗)1/2 near the saddle point x∗, a little algebra shows that

Using this, the residue theorem gives us the integral of Eq. (A27),

As discussed in the text, in this sum, only the terms with the smallest Im(S∗) contribute signif-
icantly, while the other gives exponentially small corrections. Hence the scattering coeﬃcients
are usually given by a few contributions, coming from the complex turning points the closest to
the real line. We point out here the close similarity between our derivation and the ﬁrst order
result of the Bremmer series [25, 34] (in particular Eq. (A30)). In the latter case, π/3 is only
the ﬁrst term of a series, and in the adiabatic limit, it is possible to show that the entire sum

is 1. Therefore, the adiabatic limit leads to αj→(cid:96) ∼ eiS∗ rather than Eq. (A32). This is also

what happens in the adiabatic limit of a time-dependent two-level system [35]. For this reason,
it is reasonable to conjecture that this will also be the case here. If this conjecture holds, the
replacement π/3 → 1 amounts to a partial resummation of some diagrams of the perturbative
resolution of Eq. (A14), as shown in Fig. 9.

28

Figure 9: We conjecture that the ﬁrst order expression of the scattering coeﬃcients (A32) can be
improved by the replacement π/3 → 1. The conjecture is that this replacement consists in resumming
the diagrams that involves only the roots k(cid:96) and kj. Once this is done, the higher order perturbative
expressions are obtained by summing only over diagrams that involve at least an intermediate state
that diﬀers from the initial and ﬁnal ones.

We also check that the phase shift due to Im(Q) (cid:54)= 0 is negligible in the regime of interest, i.e.

To have an estimation of the magnitude of these matrix elements, we compute them in the

On the other hand, the matrix element driving the transition ku → kd reads

(B9)

As we see, both are proportional to derivatives of the background, and are small in the smooth
limit. But the matrix elements that govern α and β are further suppressed by a factor O(ω1/2)
at low frequencies, as we mentioned at the end of Sec. III B.

2. Scattering coeﬃcients at ultra low frequencies

To obtain the ultra low frequency behavior of the scattering coeﬃcients, we take the limit
ω → 0 before the smooth limit |h(cid:48)
B| → 0. Indeed, as mentioned in Sec. III B, these two limits
do not commute, and the computation of App. A 3 is valid for |h(cid:48)
B| → 0 at ﬁxed ω. To correctly
obtain the ω → 0 limit, we directly use the low frequency expressions of the matrix elements
(B8) in the integral representation for α of Eq. (26) (the computation for β gives the same
answer in that limit). The coeﬃcient α is then given by

As argued in Sec. IV A 1, in near critical ﬂows 1−Fmax (cid:28) 1, the variations of 1−F (x) dominates
with respect to the other background quantities. Therefore, at leading order in 1 − Fmax, we
have

Since we look at the zero frequency limit, in particular we have ω (cid:28) ωmin, and hence, the phase
of the integrant is evaluated using the zero frequency expressions of the roots, i.e. Eq. (36).
Hence the saddle point of Eq. (B11) is the complex horizon deﬁned by Eq. (34). However, one
cannot use a residue theorem to compute the integral as was done in Sec. A 3. The reason is

that if we make the same change of variable, the point S∗ =(cid:82) x∗
(cid:19)1/2

point and not a pole. Instead, we compute (B11) using a saddle point theorem [42]. This gives

(ku(x(cid:48))− k+(x(cid:48)))dx(cid:48) is a branch

We see that in the ultra low frequency limit, α is still governed by the same exponential involving
the complex turning point (complex horizon in this regime) as in Eq. (A32), but the prefactor
is not 1. Instead, the prefactor vanishes as |C|2 ∼ ω/ωs. The characteristic frequency ωs is
deﬁned from Eq. (B13) and reads

ωs =

27hmin|F (cid:48)
∗|

64√2π(1 − Fmax)3/2

ωmin.

(B14)

We see that ωs/ωmin is proportional to a derivative of the background, and therefore is small in
the smooth limit. The above calculations and that of App. A 3 show that the prefactor is mainly

characterized by two behaviors. When ω (cid:28) ωs, it vanishes as ω/ωs, but for ωs (cid:28) ω (cid:46) ωmin, it

approaches 1. To reproduce this behavior, we conjectured an explicit form of the prefactor as
a function of ω and used it for the numerical plots of Figs. 5(a), 5(b), and 7. This form is

The absolute value on ω is here to remind that the prefactor is the same for αω and βω,
and doesn’t vary when one applies the relation (40). To conclude this subsection, we wish to
underline the fact that this prefactor is an eﬀective way of describing the ultra low frequency
behavior of the scattering coeﬃcients. Indeed, were we able to sum over all the singularities of
Eq. (A29), we would presumably obtain an expression valid for all values of ω (cid:46) ωmin, including
the limit ω (cid:28) ωs. It is when we restrict the sum to its dominant contribution that we lose
the possibility of taking the limit ω → 0. The ‘eﬀective’ prefactor described in Eqs. (B13) and
(B15) allows us to recover the correct ultra low frequency behavior.

3. The conserved current

In this subsection, we brieﬂy sketch how the conserved current J of Eq. (7) is obtained
and how it applies to a superposition of plane waves. This conserved current can be directly
obtained by applying the Noether theorem to the action (2) with the symmetry φ → eiλφ.
A slightly quicker way is to start from the conserved norm of Eq. (6). Indeed, the Noether
theorem says that the norm density ρ = −Im
and the current J are related by
the conservation law

When we apply ∂tρ + ∂xJ = 0 to stationary solutions φ(t, x) = Re(φω(x)e−iωt), we see that the
current (7) is x-independent. We now want to apply this current to a local superposition of
WKB waves as in Eq. (16) so as to obtain Eq. (24). Because J involves only derivatives of φ
up to third order, the ansatz of Eqs. (16), (17a), (17b), and (17c) shows that the computation
for a local WKB superposition is the same as for exact plane waves, i.e. when v, c, and hB are
constant. Moreover, since J is a quadratic quantity in the ﬁeld, it is enough to show this for a
superposition of 2 plane waves

φ = A1eik1x + A2eik2x,

(B18)

where k1 and k2 are solutions of the dispersion relation (8). Injecting the above form in (7), we
see that

The factor Ω(k)vg(k) in the diagonal terms directly follows from Eq. (B4). However, it is much
more delicate to show that the cross term J× is exactly 0. Since J is by construction independent
of x, it has to vanish. One could presumably stop here, invoking the latter argument, but it
would be instructive to understand why the ﬁrst factor of Eq. (B20) is always 0. It follows from
the fact that k1 and k2 are distinct solutions of the dispersion relation (8). We have proven
this identity, but its derivation seems rather unclear what its physical interpretation is, or how
one could generalize it. We present it in the form of the following lemma:

Lemma: Let P be the polynomial

If k1 and k2 are two distinct roots of P , we have the identity

P (k) = k4 + ak2 + bk + c.

4. Contour integral for a monotonic proﬁle

In this section, we present the computation of the contour integral necessary to obtain the
value αω→0 in the proﬁle (53), that is, Eq. (55). Interestingly, this computation is very similar
to what happens for the Schr¨odinger equation in a tanh potential [25]. The integral leading to
Eq. (55) is deﬁned as

where we used 1 − Fmax (cid:28) 1 and we have chosen x0 = xR for convenience. Before computing
the above integral, we rewrite the single step proﬁle of Eq. (53) as

F (x) = Fmax −

2De−2γx/D
1 + e−2γx/D ,

(B29)

We compute the contour integral above with the parametrization x(cid:48)(t) = xR + it∆0, with xR
and ∆0 given by Eq. (54). Using the identity

We now interpret this integral as another contour integral, clock-wise along the lower half unit

circle (see Fig. 10). For this we deﬁne z = e−iπt, which implies dz/z = −iπdt, and rewrite

and hence Eq. (55). We also deﬁne ζ = Re(S∗), which contribute to the phase shift in Eq. (60).
Using the Cardan-Tartaglia method, and following the steps of Sec. IV A 2, a computation
similar to the above one gives us the corrections in O(ω/ωmin) of Eq. (56).
