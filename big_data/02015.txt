Statistical mechanics of dense granular ﬂuids -

contacts as quasi-particles

Raphael Blumenfeld∗

Imperial College London, London SW7 2AZ, UK †

A new ﬁrst-principles statistical mechanics formulation is proposed to describe slow and dilated
granular ﬂuids, where prolonged intergranular contacts vitiate collision theory. The contacts, where
all the important physics takes place, are regarded as quasi-particles that can appear and disappear.
A contact potential, ν, is deﬁned as a measure of the ﬂuctuations and the mean coordination number
per particle and its ﬂuctuations are calculated as a function of it. This formulation extends the
Edwards statistical mechanics to slow dynamic systems and converges to it when the motion stops.
The theory is applied to a model system of a simply sheared granular material in the limit of small
conﬁning stress. The dependence of the contact potential on the shear rate is derived, making it
possible to calibrate ν experimentally and predict the coordination number distribution as a function
of the shear rate. Setting next ν = 0 as the jamming point, where the critical mean coordination
number is zc, a ﬁnite value is found for the shear rate there, ˙γc. A simple mean ﬁeld theory then
yields the scaling of the mean coordination number and its ﬂuctuations near ˙γc. Existing results in
the literature appear to support the predictions.

The behaviour of granular matter (GM), one of the
most signiﬁcant forms of matter on Earth and to hu-
man society, is still far from understood and the focus
of intensive research. Statistical studies of static gran-
ular assemblies, dating back to the 1920s [1], have been
jump-started by the introduction of granular statistical
mechanics (GSM) [2], which has been developed for en-
sembles of static systems and it is based on the entropy of
structural conﬁgurations [2–4] and of stress microstates
[7–9]. Since statistical mechanics is the most systematic
method to derive equations of state and constitutive re-
lations, extending it to dynamic systems has been a holy
grail in the ﬁeld. While such an extension is possible for
granular gases, where collisions dominate the dynamics
[10], attempts to formulate GSM for slowly ﬂowing dense
systems have proved diﬃcult.
In particular, attempts
to model such dynamics with conventional thermal sta-
tistical mechanics have not been successful in providing
general predictions. One diﬃculty is the inherent non-
ergodicity of such systems and another is that the con-
ventional phase space of positions and momenta is not
suﬃcient to account for the entire entropy. The main
problem is that in dense granular ﬂows collisions are ir-
relevant and particles are in prolonged contacts with their
neighbours. Modelling the behaviour of dense granular
ﬂuids is also useful to understanding non-brownian sus-
pensions. I restrict the discussion to slow ﬂows where an
intergranular contact network can be deﬁned and thence
one can quantify the structure [3–5] and intergranular
forces [6]. The structure and forces form the basis for
statistical mechanics of static systems [2–4, 7–9]. Thus,
not only do we need a dynamic GSM, which takes these
degrees of freedom (DFs) into account but it should also

converge to the, already well developed, static GSM as
the dynamics slows down. The construction of such a
theory is the main aim of this work. Since the structure
and the stress state are governed by the contact network,
the main idea here is to base the GSM of dynamic non-
collisional systems on the contacts. Speciﬁcally, the con-
tacts are regarded as quasi-particles that can appear and
disappear during the dynamic process.

Recall that, in the static stress-structure GSM, each
microstate comprises the same collection of particles and
the same mean coordination number. The partition func-
tion is [5]

Zs =Z e−C/τ −χ:F ΘdNf ~φ dNs ~ρ

(1)

where the vectors ~ρ (of length Ns) and ~φ (of length
Nf ) consist of the structure and force DFs, respectively,
C = ~ρ · A · ~ρ is a connectivity function, A is a con-
nectivity matrix, τ is the ‘contacture’ associated with
C - the analogue of the compactivity in the volume en-
semble. F is the force moment tensor (formed by the
outer product of the intergranular forces and their posi-
tion vectors, summed over particles), which couples the
structure to the stress state [7, 8, 11] and χij = 1/Xij
is the inverse angoricity tensor. The function Θ includes
the constraints on the systems forming the ensemble, e.g.
that they are in mechanical equilibrium, generated by the
same process and all have the same mean coordination
number z. The weighting of the structural microstates
by a connectivity function replaces the original volume
function [2], which has been found to underestimate sig-
niﬁcantly the entropy [5], but this issue is tangential to
the present formulation. In general, the structural DFs
should also include the parameters specifying the parti-
cle shapes. These DFs are ignored here for brevity, but
could be included without loss of generality [12].

The existence of a well deﬁned contact network estab-
lishes a quantiﬁable structure and its DFs [3, 4], as well

as enabling transmission of forces [6], which allows us to
extend the functions C and F in (1) to slow dynamic pro-
cesses. Additionally, Θ can be generalised to include all
the same-z structural and stress microstates accessible by
the dynamic process. It follows that expression (1) can
describe dynamic same-z structure-stress sub-ensembles.
To complete the extension, we must account for the fact
that the dynamics move the system between microstates
with diﬀerent values of z.

The extension is best illustrated in a speciﬁc con-
text. Consider a three-dimensional granular assembly of
N ≫ 1 convex particles of similar (but not necessarily
identical) sizes, and mutual dynamic friction coeﬃcient
µ. The system is a box of dimensions W × L × H, with H
the height between two parallel plates under a conﬁning
stress σn. The upper plate shears the material at a rate
L ˙γ.

To maintain σn, the system can dilate. The internal
structure and forces evolve by making and breaking con-
tacts, whose number, zN/2, ﬂuctuates. The dilation ef-
fects values of z generically below the jamming value, zc
and the focus here is on this regime. The value of zc de-
pends on the dimension, the particle roughness and, to
an extent, the loading history [13]. Zs can then be re-
garded as a sum over all the shear-induced microstates of
the same total number of contacts. The general partition
function of this process is constructed by summing over
all the same-z sub-ensembles

Ztot =

N zmax/2

Xk=N zmin/2

Zse−νk

(2)

where zmin (zmax) is the smallest (largest) number of
contacts a particle can have. ν is a newly deﬁned contact
potential, analogous to the chemical potential in ther-
mal statistical mechanics. When the motion stops and z
parks on a speciﬁc value, Ztot converges to the static one
- a feature that is absent when describing the dynamics
with thermal-like ﬂuctuations and granular temperature.
This statistical mechanics bridges, for the ﬁrst time, be-
tween statics and dynamics in these non-ergodic systems.
To derive explicit results, consider systems under very
small conﬁning stresses. In this limit, χ : F ≪ C/τ and
the latter term in Zs is negligible. Since only the total
number of contacts is constrained, a safe assumption is
that any correlations between number of contacts of dif-
ferent particles decays over a distance of a particle or two,
and I neglect such correlations altogether. Additionally,
it has been observed [5] that, for frictional particles in
this regime, ln Zs = N ln Z0, with Z0 independent of N .
Using this in (2) and reordering the summation over k
and N , the sum over contacts can be decoupled from Zs
and Ztot can be calculated exactly

FIG. 2. The ﬂuctuations of the mean coordination
number per particle as a function of the contact
potential in two dimensions (red) and three (green).
Inset: hδz2i1/2 increases monotonically with hzi in
two (red) and three (green) dimensions.

The value of zmax depends on the particle size distribu-
tion, e.g., when it is very narrow, zmax → 6 and 12 in
two and three dimensions, respectively [14].
It can be
written as a multiple of the jamming value, zmax = κzc
(κ > 1). The value of zmin depends on the dynamics: al-
lowing or disallowing ‘ﬂoaters’ and ‘rattlers’ corresponds
to zmin = 0 or 2, respectively. Including ﬂoaters, for il-
lustration, we can now calculate hzi and hδz2i explicitly,

hzi =

hδz2i =

(eν − 1)2 −

(zmax + 1)2e(zmax+1)ν

(cid:0)e(zmax+1)ν − 1(cid:1)2

These are plotted in ﬁgures 1 and 2. Relations (4) and
(5) provide a way to estimate the contact potential from
the steady-state time series of z.

Increasing the shear rate should increase particle ve-
locities and therefore the rates of contact creation and
annihilation. One then expects ∂ν/∂ ˙γ > 0. To test this
and derive experimental predictions, the next aim is to
relate ν, hzi, hδz2i and ˙γ.

At steady state, energy is dissipated through parti-
˙Ef ric, and

cles sliding over one another against friction,

FIG. 3. A sketch of the sheared system.

˙Eclap. A contact is made when two par-
contact making,
ticles collide without being able to recoil. Such a ‘clap’
converts kinetic energy to density waves in the particles
and in the surrounding ﬂuid. The dissipation is balanced
by the energy pumped into the system by the shear.

Consider an imaginary sheet of thickness δh (≤ par-
ticle size), parallel to the shear plates, h away from the
bottom plate (ﬁgure 3). The sheet contains, on average,
nW L particles, each having at most one contact within
the sheet. The mean number of contacts per sheet is
then nW L/hzi, of which only a fraction ∆ are newly
made within a time interval δt. The steady-state contact
creation, ˙z+, and annihilation, ˙z−, rates are ˙z+ = ˙z− ≈
hδz2i1/2 and, per contact, ∆ = ˙z+/hzi ≈ hδz2i1/2/hzi.
The average normal force transmitted through the sheet
per contact is σnW L/(nW L/hzi). Only a fraction p (of
order 3% [15]) of all the (1 − ∆)nW L/hzi contacts, exist-
ing prior to this δt, slide against friction [16]. Thus, the
energy dissipated by friction within the sheet is δ ˙Ef ric =
pµσnW L(1 − ∆)v(h)δh. Assuming no shear banding, we
can approximate the velocity proﬁle by v(h) = L ˙γh/H
and integrate over h to ﬁnd the total rate of energy dis-
sipated by this mechanism

˙Ef ric =

µpσnV

(1 − ∆) L ˙γ

(6)

An exponential form of v(h) would yield a similar result.
The energy lost in contact making is primarily kinetic.
In the sheet’s moving frame, the particles’ relative ve-
locities are of order hδv2i1/2, leading to a clapping en-
ergy loss of roughly mǫhδv2i per clap, where m and ǫ
are, respectively, a typical particle mass and the restitu-
tion coeﬃcient. The number of newly made contacts is
the number of particles in the sheet, nW Lδh, times the
probability that two neighbours are in contact, hzi/zmax,
times the probability that the contact has been made in
δt, ∆. Assuming hδv2i ∼ (L ˙γ)2 h/H, with a propor-
tionality constant of order 1 [17] and integrating over h,
yields the clapping energy dissipation rate,

larly, a diﬀerent dependence of hδv2i on h would change
this result by a factor of order 1, at most.

The power pumped into the system is the product of
the top plate velocity, L ˙γ, and the friction force on it,
µH σnW L, where µH is the ratio of the shear to normal
stresses at H. Equating it to the total dissipation rate,
(6) and (7), and rearranging, we obtain,

˙γ =

(8)

This expression gives a novel prediction on the depen-
dence of features of the contact number distribution on
the shear rate. Since hzi and ∆ are known functions of ν
from (4) and (5), then this expression provides another
way to estimate the contact potential and calibrate it
against the shear rate. Figures 4 - 6 show these relations
for three-dimensional granular systems, sand particles
density realistic values for µH [15, 18, 19]. Included in
these ﬁgures are plots for two-dimensional systems with
the same parameters. As expected, ν increases with ˙γ
and both hzi and hδz2i decrease with it.

Existing observations seem to validate these results. A
monotonic drop in hzi, and consequently in the packing
fraction, as ˙γ increases under constant conﬁning stress,
has been observed widely, e.g. in [15, 21–23]. While the
variation of hδz2i1/2 with ˙γ during simple shear is less
documented, the increase of hδz2i1/2 with hzi, predicted
here (inset in ﬁgure 2), has been observed experimentally
in random packs of spheres [24].

It is tempting to identify ν = 0 as the jamming point by
setting κ so that hz(ν = 0)i = zc. The value of κ depends
on the system and on whether ﬂoaters and rattlers are
included or not. For the above case, κ = 2.

Interestingly, the shear rate at the jamming point is ﬁ-

sions.

Again, the dependence of the density, ρ, on hzi in this
expression, due to dilation, is negligible. This behaviour
is supported qualitatively by simulations [6, 21, 25].

Conclusion. – A ﬁrst-principles statistical mechanical
theory has been formulated for slow dense granular ﬂu-
ids. It is based on treating the contacts as quasi-particles
that can appear and disappear as the material evolves.
The contact number ﬂuctuations are characterised by a
contact potential, ν, analogous to the chemical potential
in thermal statistical mechanics.
In relatively uniform
systems, e.g.
in the absence of shear banding, regions
with high mean coordination number dilate and ‘shed’
contacts, while low contact regions densify to gain some
- the rates of which are controlled by ν.

Applying the formalism to simple shear under con-
stant conﬁning pressure, explicit relations have been de-
rived for the dependence of the expected mean coordi-
nation number, hzi, and its ﬂuctuations, hδ2zi, on ν.
The contact potential has been then related explicitly
to the shear rate at steady state, using balance between
the shearing energy and the energy dissipated by par-
ticle friction and clapping. This enabled relating hzi
and hδ2zi to the shear rate, making it possible to cal-
ibrate the contact potential in shear experiments. The
cited literature supports well relation hz ( ˙γ)i and, tenta-
tively, the dependence of ratio hδ2zi1/2/hzi on the strain
rate, but no systematic results in this regime exist for
hδ2z ( ˙γ)i. Note that since p ≪ 1 [6, 15, 21] then (8) yields
hδ2zi1/2 ∼ ˙γ−1 + O(p), which could be tested experimen-
tally. It would be useful to test these results further by
simple shear experiments in the steady state regime, e.g.,
using a continuous parallel plate shear apparatus [26].
We are looking forward to experiments testing the con-
cept of the contact potential, which could also be done
in non-Brownian dense suspensions [23].

It would also be useful to test the assumptions under-
lying the clapping energy dissipation, e.g. by acoustic
emission experiments [27], and whether Eclap ∼ ˙γ2. This
relation has been examined numerically in [28], who ﬁnd
that the total dissipation appears to be proportional to
˙γ2. However, it is likely that the eﬀect of sliding fric-
tion in those simulations is too small due to the very low
fraction of mobilised sliding contacts.

Conjecturing that ν = 0 should correspond to the jam-
ming point enables a derivation of the ﬁnite value of the
shear rate, at which jamming occurs, as well as the scal-
ing of zc − hzi with shear rate near jamming in the mean-
ﬁeld approximation, which this analysis is based on. The
analysis can be readily extended to the dependence of
any moment of the distribution of z on the shear rate.
This author plans to apply the formalism to other dense
granular ﬂows to test the generality of this approach.
