A NOTE ON FRACTIONAL p-LAPLACIAN
PROBLEMS WITH SINGULAR WEIGHTS

KY HO, KANISHKA PERERA, INBO SIM, AND MARCO SQUASSINA

Dedicated with admiration to Paul Rabinowitz, a master in Nonlinear Analysis

Abstract. We study a class of fractional p-Laplacian problems with weights which are possibly
singular on the boundary of the domain. We provide existence and multiplicity results as well
as characterizations of critical groups and related applications.

1. Introduction

Let s ∈ (0, 1) and Ω ⊂ RN be a bounded domain with Lipschitz boundary ∂Ω. Consider also
a Carath´eodory function f : Ω × R → R. Recently, the following semi-linear problem involving
the fractional Laplacian has been the subject of various investigations

((−∆)su = f (x, u)

u = 0

in Ω,
in RN \ Ω.

The nonlocal operator (−∆)s naturally arises in various ﬁelds, such as continuum mechanics,
phase transition phenomena, population dynamics, game theory and ﬁnancial mathematics [1,4].
Existence [25, 26], non-existence [23] and regularity [5, 22] have been studied intensively. In this
paper, we consider quasi-linear problems

(1.1)

((−∆)s

u = 0

pu = f (x, u)

in Ω,
in RN \ Ω,

containing a nonlocal nonlinear operator known as the fractional p-Laplacian, which represents
a natural extension of fractional Laplacian. For p ∈ (1,∞) and u smooth enough,

p u(x) = 2 lim

εց0ˆRN \Bε(x)

|u(x) − u(y)|p−2 (u(x) − u(y))

|x − y|N +sp

dy,

x ∈ RN .

We refer to [4] for the motivations that lead to the introduction of this operator. So far, existence
and regularity for the above problem have been investigated [3, 13–15, 17, 18] under the assump-
tion that the function f is L∞-Carath´eodory, namely nonsingular in the x-dependence on ∂Ω.
Our goal in this paper is to get existence results for (1.1) when f involves singular weights. It is
worth noticing that this is new even for the plain fractional Laplacian. This paper is motivated
by [21] where the p-Laplace equation −∆pu = f (x, u) was investigated with singular weights,
namely ∆pu = div(|∇u|p−2∇u) and f satisﬁes the subcritical growth condition
(1.2)

for some qi ∈ [1, p∗) with p∗ := N p/(N − p) and measurable weights hi ≥ 0 which are possibly
singular along the boundary ∂Ω. Admissible classes of weights are introduced in [21], which
are appropriate in order to use H¨older and Hardy inequalities to show that the functional
associated with (1.1) is well-deﬁned and the Palais-Smale condition holds at any energy level,
allowing to obtain several existence results. Previously, the semi-linear case was considered e.g.
in [7, 8, 24, 27].

By introducing a suitable class of weights we will get results about existence, multiplicity and
characterization of critical groups for any s ∈ (0, 1). More precisely, in Theorem 3.4, we get a
multiplicity result for f (x, u) = h(x)|u|q−2u with q 6= p. Theorems 4.1, 4.2 and 4.8 are about
the computation of critical groups at zero of the functional associated with (1.1) when f (x, u) is
a sum of terms with singular weight enjoying proper summability. Moreover, in Proposition 3.2
we prove the boundedness of solutions for f (x, u) = λh(x)|u|p−2u with h belonging to a suitable
class. In Theorem 5.5, nontrivial solutions are found under various conditions on f . Finally, in
Theorem 6.2, we establish the existence of inﬁnitely many solutions when f (x, u) is odd in u.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide a suitable functional framework for
problem (1.1) and prove some preliminary results. In Section 3, we consider related eigenvalue
problems. In Section 4, we compute the critical groups of the functional associated with (1.1).
Section 5 is devoted to show existence of nontrivial solutions via cohomological local splitting
and critical groups. Finally, in Section 6, we obtain the existence of inﬁnitely many solutions.

2. Functional framework and preliminaries

Throughout the paper we will assume that Ω ⊂ RN is a bounded Lipschitz domain with N ≥ 2.
In this section, we provide the variational setting on a suitable function space for (1.1), jointly
with some preliminary results. We consider, for any p ∈ (1,∞) and s ∈ (0, 1), the space

endowed with the standard Gagliardo norm

(2.1)

W s,p

0 (Ω) :=(cid:8)u ∈ W s,p(RN ) : u = 0 in RN \ Ω(cid:9),
kuk :=(cid:18)ˆR2N

|x − y|N +sp dxdy(cid:19)1/p

|u(x) − u(y)|p

.

u 7→(cid:18)ˆRN |u(x)|pdx +ˆR2N

|u(x) − u(y)|p

|x − y|N +sp dxdy(cid:19)1/p

,

We observe that, as it can be readily seen, this norm is equivalent to the full norm

namely a Poincar´e inequality holds in W s,p

0 (Ω). Let
N p
N − sp

p∗
s :=

,

s = ∞ if N ≤ sp. It is well-known that W s,p

with the agreement that p∗
0 (Ω) is a uniformly convex
reﬂexive Banach space, continuously embedded into Lq(Ω) for all q ∈ [1, p∗
s] if N > sp, for all
1 ≤ q < ∞ if N = sp and into L∞(Ω) for N < sp. It is also compactly injected in Lq(Ω) for any
q ∈ [1, p∗
0 (Ω) is a dense subspace of
W s,p

belong to the closure of C ∞

0 (Ω) with respect to the norm (2.1). In particular, restrictions to Ω of functions in W s,p

(Ω) :=(cid:18)ˆΩ |u(x)|pdx +ˆΩˆΩ

|u(x) − u(y)|p

|x − y|N +sp dxdy(cid:19)1/p

.

This closure is often denoted with the same symbol W s,p
0 (Ω). Notice that for the seminorm
localized on Ω × Ω there is no Poincar´e inequality with ´Ω |u|pdx if sp ≤ 1, cf. [3, Remark 2.4].

Next we state some Hardy-type inequalities from [6, Theorem 1.1 and formula (17)], for the
cases sp 6= 1 and [16, Theorem 6.5], for the particular case sp = 1.
Theorem 2.1 (Hardy inequality). For any p ∈ (1,∞) and s ∈ (0, 1) the following facts hold:

• if sp > 1, then for any u ∈ W s,p

0 (Ω) we have

ˆΩ

|u(x)|p

dist(x, ∂Ω)sp dx ≤ C ˆΩˆΩ

|u(x) − u(y)|p
|x − y|N +sp dxdy,

where C is a positive constant depending only on Ω, N, p and s.
• if sp < 1, then for any u ∈ W s,p

0 (Ω) we have

ˆΩ

dist(x, ∂Ω)sp dx ≤ C ′(cid:18)ˆΩ |u|p dx +ˆΩˆΩ
|u(x)|p

|u(x) − u(y)|p

|x − y|N +sp dxdy(cid:19),

where C ′ is a positive constant depending only on Ω, N, p and s.
• if sp = 1, then for any u ∈ W s,p

0 (Ω) we have
dist(x, ∂Ω)sp dx ≤ C ′′ˆR2N

|u(x)|p

ˆΩ

|u(x) − u(y)|p
|x − y|N +sp dxdy,

where C ′′ is a positive constant depending only on Ω, N, p and s.

As a by-product of the previous result, in any case, by (2.1) and the related Poincar´e inequality,

ˆΩ

|u(x)|p

dist(x, ∂Ω)sp dx ≤ Ckukp,

for any u ∈ W s,p

0 (Ω),

where C is a positive constant depending only on Ω, N, p and s. Let us denote by

ρ(x) := dist(x, ∂Ω),

x ∈ Ω,

s), let Aq denote the class of measurable

the distance from x ∈ Ω to ∂Ω and by | · |p the usual norm in the space Lp(Ω).
We consider the following classes of singular weights.
Deﬁnition 2.2 (Class of weights Aq). For q ∈ [1, p∗
functions h such that h ∈ Lr(Ω) for some r ∈ (1,∞) satisfying 1
Deﬁnition 2.3 (Class of weights Bq). For q ∈ [1, p∗
functions h such that hρsa ∈ Lr(Ω) for some a ∈ [0, q−1] and r ∈ (1,∞) satisfying 1
1.
Clearly, Aq ⊂ Bq, by simply choosing a = 0. Explicitly, h belongs to the above classes provided
that there exist r > 1 and 0 ≤ a ≤ q − 1 with
ˆΩ |h(x)|rdx < ∞, with
ˆΩ |h(x)|rρ(x)sardx < ∞, with

We now deﬁne the operator A : W s,p
hA(u), vi := ˆR2N
A weak solution of problem (1.1) is a function u ∈ W s,p

It is easy to see that A satisﬁes the following compactness condition [15, 20]:

(S) If {un}n∈N ⊂ W s,p

0 (Ω) is such that un ⇀ u in W s,p

n → ∞, then un → u in W s,p

0 (Ω) as n → ∞.

0 (Ω) and hA(un), un − ui → 0 as

Assuming that f satisﬁes condition (1.2) for some exponents qi ∈ [1, p∗
of Lemma 2.4, there exists a constant C > 0 such that, for all u, v ∈ W s,p

hi ∈ Bqi. Then any bounded sequence {un}n∈N ⊂ W s,p

Proof. Since {un}n∈N is bounded in W s,p

Hence, un → u in W s,p

3. Eigenvalue problems

(cid:3)

We consider the eigenvalue problem

(3.1)

((−∆)s

u = 0

pu = λh(x)|u|p−2u

in Ω,
in RN \ Ω,

h(x)|un|pdx −ˆΩ

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)ˆΩ

where h ∈ Ap is possibly sign-changing with |{x ∈ Ω : h(x) > 0}| > 0 and λ is a real number.
We consider the ﬁrst eigenvalue, deﬁned as follows
pkukp : u ∈ W s,p

0 (Ω), ˆΩ

p |u|p dx = 1(cid:27) .

µ1 := inf(cid:26) 1

We have the following
Theorem 3.1. Let h ∈ Bp. Then µ1 is attained by some nonnegative φ1 ∈ W s,p
more, φ1 > 0 a.a. if h ≥ 0, and any two ﬁrst eigenfunctions are proportional.
Proof. Since h ∈ Bp, a standard argument yields the existence of an eigenfunction φ1 ≥ 0. In
fact, notice that, if {un}n∈N ⊂ W s,p

0 (Ω) is weakly convergent to some u, we have

0 (Ω). Further-

h(x)

h(x)|u|pdx(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ C ˆΩ

h(x)|un|p−1|un − u|dx + C ˆΩ

h(x)|un|p−1|un − u|dx

≤ C(kunkp−1 + kukp−1)|un − u|b ≤ C|un − u|b = on(1),

by Lemma 2.4 and since |un − u|b → 0 up to a subsequence, where b ∈ (1, p∗
s) is such that
1/r + a/p + (p − a)/b = 1, for some a ∈ [0, p − 1]. It follows from [2, Theorem A.1] that φ1 > 0,
provided h ≥ 0. The simplicity follows as in [12].
Next we show the boundedness of weak solutions by modifying the argument in [12].
Proposition 3.2. Let u be any eigenfunction of (3.1). Then u ∈ L∞(RN ).
Proof. The proof follows the line of [12]. We shall provide the details for the sake of completeness.
Denoting u+ := max{u, 0}, it suﬃces to show that, for any weak solution u ∈ W s,p
(3.2)
for some δ > 0. For each k ∈ N ∪ {0}, set wk := (u − (1 − 1/2k))+. Then wk ∈ W s,p
a.a. x ∈ {wk+1 > 0},

|u|∞ ≤ 1 provided that |u+|q ≤ δ,

and {wk+1 > 0} ⊆ {wk > 2−(k+1)}. Moreover, for a measurable v, we have the inequality
(3.3)
for a.a. x, y ∈ RN . Applying (3.3) for v = u − (1 − 1/2k+1), we have v+ = wk+1 and
dxdy

|v(x) − v(y)|p−2(v+(x) − v+(y))(v(x) − v(y)) ≥ |v+(x) − v+(y)|p

|u(x) − u(y)|p−2(u(x) − u(y)(wk+1(x) − wk+1(y))

kwk+1kp ≤ ˆR2N

= λˆ{wk+1>0}

h(x)|u(x)|p−2u(x)wk+1(x)dx.

|x − y|N +sp

Whence, by the above stated properties, we get

kwk+1kp ≤ |λ|(2k+1 − 1)p−1ˆ{wk+1>0} |h(x)||wk(x)|pdx.

By the H¨older inequality, we then obtain

Let ¯q be such that q < ¯q < p∗

|{wk+1 > 0}| ≤ |{wk > 2−(k+1)}| ≤ 2q(k+1)U q/p
Combining the previous inequality yields Uk+1 ≤ C|λ|(2k+1−1)p−1|h|r2

which is made possible by a simple scaling argument due to the homogeneity of the problem, we

(cid:3)
Next we consider the eigenvalue problem

(3.4)

((−∆)s

u = 0

pu = λh(x)|u|q−2u

in Ω,
in RN \ Ω,

where q ∈ [1, p∗
eigenvalues for problem (3.4), following the argument in [21]. Let

s) and h ∈ Bq with |{x ∈ Ω : h(x) > 0}| > 0. We shall produce a sequence of

and set (we use the notations of [20, Chapter 4])

u ∈ W s,p

0 (Ω),

h(x)
J(u) := ˆΩ
q |u|q dx,
u ∈ M, M :=(cid:26)u ∈ W s,p

0 (Ω) :

1

pkukp = 1 and J(u) > 0(cid:27) .

Ψ(u) :=

1

J(u)

,

Then M is nonempty and positive eigenvalues and associated eigenfunctions of (3.4) on M
coincide with critical values and critical points of Ψ, respectively. By Lemma 2.4, we have

0 < J(u) ≤ Ckukq ≤ C,

for all u ∈ M,

for some constant C > 0, and hence λ1 := inf u∈M Ψ(u) > 0. A slight variant of Lemma 2.5
yields the following

Lemma 3.3. For all c ∈ R, Ψ satisﬁes the Palais-Smale condition, namely every sequence
{un}n∈N ⊂ M with Ψ(un) → c and Ψ′(un) → 0 has a subsequence converging to some u ∈ M.
Although one can obtain an increasing and unbounded sequence of critical values of Ψ via
standard minimax schemes, we prefer to use a cohomological index as in Perera [19], which
provides additional topological information about the associated critical points. Let us recall
the deﬁnition of the Z2-cohomological index of Fadell and Rabinowitz [10]. Let W be a Banach
space. For a symmetric subset M of W \ {0}, let M = M/Z2 be the quotient space of M
with each u and −u identiﬁed, let f : M → RP∞ be the classifying map of M , and let f ∗ :

FRACTIONAL p-LAPLACIAN PROBLEMS WITH SINGULAR WEIGHTS

7

H ∗(RP∞) → H ∗(M ) be the induced homomorphism of the Alexander-Spanier cohomology rings.
Then the cohomological index of M is deﬁned by

i(M ) =(sup(cid:8)m ≥ 1 : f ∗(ωm−1) 6= 0(cid:9) , M 6= ∅,

0,

M = ∅,

where ω ∈ H 1(RP∞) is the generator of the polynomial ring H ∗(RP∞) = Z2[ω]. For example,
the classifying map of the unit sphere Sm−1 in Rm, m ≥ 1, is the inclusion RPm−1 ⊂ RP∞,
which induces isomorphisms on H q for q ≤ m − 1, so i(Sm−1) = m. Let F denote the class of
symmetric subsets of M, and set

λk := inf
M ∈F

sup
u∈M

i(M )≥k

Ψ(u),

k ≥ 1.

Then {λk}k∈N is a sequence of positive eigenvalues of (3.4), λk ր +∞, and
i({u ∈ M : Ψ(u) ≤ λk}) = i({u ∈ M : Ψ(u) < λk+1}) = k
(3.5)

if λk < λk+1, see [20, Propositions 3.52 and 3.53]. As a simple application, we consider the
problem

(3.6)

((−∆)s

u = 0

pu = h(x)|u|q−2u

in Ω,
in RN \ Ω.

By arguing as in the proof of [21, Theorem 3.2], we have the following
Theorem 3.4. Let q ∈ [1, p∗
(3.6) admits a sequence of nontrivial weak solutions {un}n∈N ⊂ W s,p

s) \ {p} and h ∈ Bq with |{x ∈ Ω : h(x) > 0}| > 0. Then problem

0 (Ω) such that

i) if q < p, then kunk → 0 as n → ∞,
ii) if q > p, then kunk → ∞ as n → ∞.

In this section we compute the critical groups at zero of the functional

In the absence of a direct sum decomposition, the main technical tool we use to get an estimate
of the critical groups is the notion of a cohomological local splitting introduced in [20]. When
sp > N , it suﬃces to assume the sign conditions on G in Theorem 4.1 for small |t| by the
imbedding W s, p
Theorem 4.2 (Critical groups II). Assume that sp > N , h ∈ Bp with |{x ∈ Ω : h(x) > 0}| > 0,
g satisﬁes (4.2) with qi > p and 0 is an isolated critical point of Φ. Then we have
(1) C 0(Φ, 0) ≈ Z2 and C q(Φ, 0) = 0 for q ≥ 1 if λ = λ1 and, for some δ > 0, G(x, t) ≤ 0 for
(2) C k(Φ, 0) 6= 0 in the following cases:

a.a. x ∈ Ω and |t| ≤ δ.
(a) λ = λk < λk+1 and, for some δ > 0, G(x, t) ≥ 0 for a.a. x ∈ Ω and |t| ≤ δ;
(b) λk < λk+1 = λ and, for some δ > 0, G(x, t) ≤ 0 for a.a. x ∈ Ω and |t| ≤ δ.

As we will show next, the conclusions of Theorem 4.2 hold for sp ≤ N when the weights h and
Ki belong to suitable strengthened subclasses of Bp and Bqi, respectively.

Smale condition over Bε(0) in light of Lemma 2.5 and that the map [0, 1] ∋ τ → Φτ ∈
C 1(Bε(0), R) is continuous, we need to show that for suﬃciently small ε, Bε(0) contains no
critical point of any Φτ other than 0. Suppose uj → 0 in W s,p

Following the proof of [21, Lemma 4.8] where we use Lemma 4.5 several times, we obtain that
uj ∈ L∞(Ω) and uj → 0 in L∞(Ω) by means of Lemma 4.6. Then, for suﬃciently large j ∈ N,
|uj(x)| ≤ δ/2 for a.a. x ∈ Ω and hence Φ′(uj) = Φ′
τj (uj) = 0, contradicting the assumption that
0 was an isolated critical point of Φ.

(2) G(x, t) ≥ 0 for a.a. x ∈ Ω and all t ∈ R;
(3) G(x, t) ≤ 0 for a.a. x ∈ Ω and all t ∈ R;
(4) sp > N and, for some δ > 0, G(x, t) ≥ 0 for a.a. x ∈ Ω and |t| ≤ δ;
(5) sp > N and, for some δ > 0, G(x, t) ≤ 0 for a.a. x ∈ Ω and |t| ≤ δ;

(6) sp ≤ N , h ∈ eBp, Ki ∈ eBqi and, for some δ > 0, G(x, t) ≥ 0 for a.a. x ∈ Ω and |t| ≤ δ;
(7) sp ≤ N , h ∈ eBp, Ki ∈ eBqi and, for some δ > 0, G(x, t) ≤ 0 for a.a. x ∈ Ω and |t| ≤ δ.

Proof. Suppose that 0 is the only critical point of Φ. Taking U = W s,p

0 (Ω) in (4.3), we have

C q(Φ, 0) = H q(Φ0, Φ0 \ {0}).

Let α < 0 be as in Lemma 5.4. Since Φ has no other critical points and satisﬁes the Palais-Smale
condition by Lemma 5.3, Φ0 is a deformation retract of W s,p
0 (Ω) and Φα is a deformation retract
of Φ0 \ {0} by the second deformation lemma. So
C q(Φ, 0) ≈ H q(W s,p

0 (Ω), Φα) = 0 ∀q

since Φα is contractible in itself, contradicting Theorem 4.1, Theorem 4.2, or Theorem 4.8. (cid:3)

Then Φ has a sequence of critical values tending to +∞.
Invoking this theorem, we obtain the existence of inﬁnitely many solutions for problem (5.1).

where b satisﬁes 1/r + a/p + (q − a)/b = 1, where a, r are as in Bq. Set βn = max{β′

to the compact injections W s,p
0 (Ω) ֒→֒→ Lq(Ω) we have that βn → 0
as n → ∞ in view of the abstract result [11, Lemma 3.3]. Then there exists n0 ∈ N such that
βn ≤ 1 for all n ≥ n0. For each n ∈ N, deﬁne γn by γn := 1/√βn and hence, γn ≥ 1 for all
n ≥ n0 and γn → ∞ as n → ∞. For u ∈ Zn with kuk = γn, we have

Since dim(Yn) < ∞, the norms k · k, | · |q and | · |Lq(K,Ω) are equivalent. As p, mi < q, choosing
ε small enough the last estimate yields Φ(u) ≤ 0 for all u ∈ Yn with kuk large enough. This
completes (H2). The proof is now complete.
