It is critical to capture the eﬀect due to strain and material interface for device level transistor
modeling. We introduced a transferable sp3d5s* tight binding model with nearest neighbor interac-
tions for arbitrarily strained group IV and III-V materials. The tight binding model is parameterized
with respect to Hybrid functional(HSE06) calculations for varieties of strained systems. The tight
binding calculations of ultra small superlattices formed by group IV and group III-V materials
show good agreement with the corresponding HSE06 calculations. The application of tight binding
model to superlattices demonstrates that transferable tight binding model with nearest neighbor
interactions can be obtained for group IV and III-V materials.

INTRODUCTION

Modern ﬁeld eﬀect transistors have reached critical de-
vice dimensions in sub-10 nanometer. To surpass the
coming limits of downscaling of ﬁeld eﬀect transistor,
innovative devices such as tunneling ﬁeld-eﬀect transis-
tors(TFET)1–3 and superlattice ﬁeld-eﬀect transistors4,5
are actively investigated. Those devices rely strongly on
the usage of hetero-structures and strain techniques. To
have reliable prediction of the performance in those de-
vices, it is critical to have a atomistic model that is able to
model strained ultra-small heterostructures accurately.

Ab-initio methods oﬀer atomistic representations with
subatomic resolution for a variety of materials and het-
erostructures. However, accurate ab-initio methods, such
as Hybrid functionals6,7, GW8,9 and BSE10 approxi-
mations are in general computationally too expensive
to be applied to systems with a size of realistic de-
vice. Furthermore, those methods assume equilibrium
and cannot truly model out-of-equilibrium device condi-
tions where e.g. a large voltage might have been applied
to drive carriers. For these reasons, more eﬃcient semi-
empirical approaches, such as the k· p11,12, the empirical
pseudopotential13 and the empirical tight-binding(ETB)
methods14,15 are actively developed.

Among these empirical approaches, ETB method has
established itself as the standard state-of-the-art basis for
realistic device simulations16. ETB has been successfully
applied to electronic structures of millions of atoms17
as well as on non-equilibrium transport problems that
even involve inelastic scattering18. For strained systems,
modiﬁed ETB models take into account the altered en-
vironment in terms of both bond angle and length. In
the simplest tight binding strain model, generalized Har-
rison’s law14,19,20 is usually adopted to describe bond-
length dependence of the nearest-neighbor coupling pa-
rameters. Changes of bond angles in interatomic interac-
tions are automatically incorporated through the Slater-
Koster formulas21. This simplest tight binding strain

model can reproduce some hydrostatic and uniaxial de-
formation potentials14, while much higher accuracy can
be achieved by introducing the strain-dependent onsite
parameters. Boykin et al.15 introduced nearest neigh-
bor position dependent diagonal orbital energies to the
sp3d5s* tight binding model to reproduce correct defor-
mations under [001] strains. Oﬀ-diagonal onsite correc-
tions are suggested by Niquet et al.22 and Boykin et al.23
to model the strain behavior of indirect conduction val-
leys of materials with diamond structures under [110]
strains.

Those existing ETB strain models are ﬁtted to pure
instead of more complicated
strained bulk material
nanostructures. However, the transferability of those
ETB models and parameters is questionable when ap-
plied to heterostructures. First of all, traditional ETB
parameters depend on material types, while material
type around interfaces can not be clearly deﬁned. Fig.1
shows three possible deﬁnitions of materials near a
GaAs/AlAs interface. Interface As atoms are interpreted
as atoms in either (a) As of AlAs or (b) As of GaAs.
Another usual assumption, shown by deﬁnition (c),is to
take the interface As atoms to have an average of the
onsite potentials. All those deﬁnitions are customarily
used but with no hard data to justify. Secondly, it was
shown that ETB parameters obtained by direct ﬁtting
possibly lead to unphysical results in nano-structures like
ultra-thin bodies24,25. To improve the transferability of
ETB parameters, ab-initio mapping methods are devel-
oped in ref 24. This method is an ab-initio wave functions
based tight binding parameterization algorithm. With
this method, it is shown that ETB models are transfer-
able to Si and GaAs ultra thin bodies.

In this paper, a new ETB model for strained materials
considering only nearest neighbor interactions is intro-
duced for strained group IV and III-V semiconductors.
This strain model takes account of arbitrary strain ef-
fects to band structure. Transferable ETB parameters

cation of ETB model in strained superlattices, the tight
binding results for superlattices are compared with hy-
brid functional calculations. Finally, the ETB model of
strained materials and corresponding results are summa-
rized in Section IV.

II. MODEL

The ETB model of strained materials in this work is
based on the multipole expansion26 of the local poten-
tial near each atom. This ETB model has environment
dependency, and it does not rely on the selection of co-
ordinates. It can be applied to arbitrarily strained and
rotated systems. In this work, the tight binding model
is applied to group IV and III-V semiconductors with
diamond or zincblende structures. However, this model
is in principle not limited to group IV and III-V semi-
conductors. For the presented materials, the interaction
range considered in the tight binding model is limited
to the ﬁrst nearest neighbors. In the following sections,
letters in bold such as r and d are used for three dimen-
sional vectors; correspondingly, r and d are used to de-
note the lengths of r and d. Ω stands for polar angle and
θ and azimuth angle φ of a three dimensional vector. α,
β,γ correspond to angular and magnetic quantum num-
bers l1m1,l2m2 and l3m3 of ETB orbitals respectively.
Dirac notation is used for ETB basis functions, e.g. |ψαi(cid:105)
stands for α orbital of atom i.

A. Multipole expansion of atomic potentials

The local potential near atom i is approximated by a
summation of the potential of atom i and potential of its
nearest neighbors j

tial Uj(|r− dij|) centered at dij has multipole expansion

ing Uj (|r − dij|) in eq (1) by equation (2), the total po-
tential near atom i given by equation (1) can be written

Since this work limits orbitals α and β to s,p,d and
s*, the dipole potentials lead to non-zero oﬀ-diagonal on-
site among s-p, and p-d orbitals. While the quadrupole
potential lead to non-zero oﬀ-diagonal onsite among p-p,
and d-d orbitals. Therefore, there is no confusion to use
Cαiβi,j instead of C (l)
αi,βi,j. In this work, it turns out the
bond length dependency of Cαiβi,j can be neglected, since
the strain considered in this work has amplitudes up to
4%. The oﬀ-diagonal onsite elements depend completely
on the bond angle changes. Fitting parameters for on-
site elements introduced in this work include Eαi, Iαi,j,
λαi,j, Cαiβi,j. For atoms in alloys or material interfaces,
where an atom might has diﬀerent type of neighbors, an
averaged Cαiβi,j over neighbors j is used in this work.

Here the d0 is the reference bond length. The parameter
δdij is introduced to modulate discrepancy between ab-
initio results and experimental results. Non-zero δdij’s
are introduced to match the ETB results in this work
with experimental data under room temperature; while
with zero δdij, ETB results match the zero tempera-
ture ab-initio results. The term Eαi depends on orbital
and atom type instead of material type. The summation
over Iαi,j(dij) and Oi,j(dij) are the environment depen-
dent part of diagonal onsite energies H (0)
αi,αi. Oi,j(dij)
is used to modulate the band oﬀset and it satisﬁes
Oi,j(dij) = Oji(dji). Similar expression is also applied
to spin-orbit coupling terms ∆SOC

In this work, only spin-orbit interaction of p orbitals is
considered. The bond length dependency of ∆i,j is ne-
glected as well.

TABLE IV: Bond length dependent interactomic coupling parameters for group IV and III-V materials. In Si and Ge, both ’a’
and ’c’ denote the same atom. For Si-Ge bond, ’a’ correspond to Si and ’c’ correspond to Ge. The parameters V ’s are in the
unit of eV. parameters η’s are in the unit of ˚A−1.

where k’s denotes the nearest neighbors of atom i, k(cid:48)
denotes the nearest neighbors of atom j. The Q(l)
γ,β(dik)
and Q(l)

α,γ(cid:48)(djk(cid:48)) are given by
(dik) = (cid:104)ψγ(r)|U (l)(r, dik)|ψβ(r − dij)(cid:105)
(18)
(djk(cid:48)) = (cid:104)ψα(r)|U (l)(|r − dij|, djk(cid:48))|ψγ(cid:48)(r − dij)(cid:105)
Q(l)
αi,γ(cid:48)
The |ψγ(r)(cid:105) has the same radial part as |ψα(r)(cid:105) , although
γ and α are diﬀerent. Q(l)
(djk(cid:48)) are
three center integrals involving orbitals of atom i,j and
potential U (l) from atom k or k(cid:48). However, since the
quadrupole potential U (l) are centered either at atom i or

γi,βj

αi,γ(cid:48)

(dik) and Q(l)

(djk(cid:48)) has the expression of
two center integrals describing by Slater Koster formulas.
To simplify the formula, we approximate the eﬀect of
(cid:80)
U (l)(r, dik)’s by using averaged potential over k and k(cid:48)
to remove the dependency of atom k and k(cid:48), ¯U (l)(r) =
k(cid:48) U (l)(|r −
dij|, djk(cid:48)).

(cid:80)
k U (l)(r, dik) , ¯U (l)(|r − dij|) = 1

For dipole potentials, the complete explicit expressions
of equation(17) are quite lengthy. In this work, we ﬁnd
it is suﬃcient to approximated them with Slater Koster
formula. The impact of U (1) appears in term of strain
correction δV (1)

The d0 is the reference bond length. More discussion
of his approximation is given in appendix B. pij and qij
estimate the impact of dipole moment to neighbors. The
non-zero pij correspond to non-zero oﬀ-diagonal strain
components, while the nonzero term qij corresponds to
bond length changes which break crystal symmetry.
For quadrupole potentials, we ﬁnd it is suﬃcient to
drop the bond length dependency of ¯U (2)(r) and ¯U (l)(|r−

tional. In all presented HSE06 calculations, a cutoﬀ en-
ergy of 350eV is used. Γ-point centered Monkhorst Pack
kspace grids are used for both bulk and superlattice sys-
tems. The size of the kspace grid for strained bulk cal-
culations is 6 × 6 × 6, while one for 001 superlattices is
6× 6× 3. k-points with integration weights equal to zero
are added to the original uniform grids in order to gener-
ate energy bands with higher k-space resolution. PAW32
pseudopotentials are used in all HSE06 calculations. The
pseudopotentials for all atoms include the outermost oc-
cupied s and p atomic states as valence states. Ab-inito
band structures of strained and unstrained bulk materials
are aligned based on model solid theory33,34. With the
model solid theory, relative band oﬀsets are determined
by using diﬀerent superlattices.

A. Room temperature targets

Ab-initio calculations usually assume zero temperature,
while TB models matching room temperature experi-
ments are usually required for realistic device modeling.
In this work, in order to get ab-initio band structures
matching experiments under room temperature, artiﬁ-
cial hydrostatic strain is applied to individual material
to mimic the eﬀect of room temperature and to compen-
sate the error of ab-initio calculations. With hydrostatic
strain, lattice constants change from a0 to a0 + δa. This
artiﬁcial lattice constant change can be used to adjust the
ab-initio band gap of semiconductors to match ﬁnite tem-
perature experimental band gap. Table XI shows the re-
quired δa in order to match HSE06 band gaps with room
temperature experimental data. It can be seen that the
most of the required δa are in general less than 1% hydro-
static strain. The AlP requires δa up to 2%a0. By this
adjustment, band gaps of most of the presented semicon-
ductors reach less than 0.05eV mismatch compared with
experimental results. The largest mismatch appears in
AlAs which has the mismatch of about 0.1eV. Since the
parameterization algorithm used in this work relies on
the ab-initio wave functions, the concern of this artiﬁcial
adjustment is that whether it will change ab-initio wave
functions signiﬁcantly. Fig. 6 shows the contribution of
diﬀerent orbitals in ab-initio wave functions as a function
of lattice constant. Here the ab-initio wave functions of
InAs with diﬀerent lattice constants are represented by
the same basis functions.
It can be seen that the ev-
ery percent of hydrostatic strain introduced changes the
contribution of orbitals up to 0.02. Similar trend was
observed in other group III-V and IV materials. Thus
the artiﬁcial adjustment introduces negligible changes to
wave functions. In this work, the ETB parameters are all
ﬁtted with respect to ab-initio results that are adjusted
with respect to room temperature experiments.

B. ETB parameters for strained materials

The ETB model
in this work makes use of sp3d5s*
basis functions. The sp3d5s* empirical ETB model
with nearest neighbor interactions has been proved to

III. RESULTS

In this work, ab-initio level calculations of group IV
and III-V systems were performed with VASP29. The
screened hybrid functional of Heyd, Scuseria, and Ernz-
erhof (HSE06)6 is used to produce the bulk and the
superlattices band structures with band gaps compara-
ble with experiments30. In the HSE06 hybrid functional
method scheme, the total exchange energy incorporates
25% short-range Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange and 75%
Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof(PBE) exchange31. The screen-
ing parameter µ which deﬁnes the range separation is
empirically set to 0.2 ˚A for both the HF and PBE parts.
The correlation energy is described by the PBE func-

be a suﬃcient model for bulk zincblende and diamond
structures15,24,35. To parameterize the ETB model from
ab-initio results, both ab-initio band structure and wave
functions are considered as ﬁtting targets. The process
of parameterization from ab-initio results was described
by Ref. 24.

To obtain ETB parameters for strained materials, the
process of parameterization from ab-initio results by Ref.
24 is applied to multiple strained systems. To consider
multiple systems in the ﬁtting process, a total ﬁtness to
be minimized is deﬁned as a summation of ﬁtness of all

systems considered (labeled by index s) Ftotal =(cid:80)

s Fs.
The ﬁtness Fs is deﬁned to capture important targets
of each stained system considered in the ﬁtting process.
The strained systems considered in this work are shown
by Fig. 2, including zincblende or diamond structures
with a) hydro static strain, b) pure bond length changes,
c) diagonal strains and d) oﬀ-diagonal strain. For Hydro-
static strain cases, materials with diﬀerent lattice con-
stant ranging from 5.2 to 6.6 ˚A are considered. While for
other kind of strains, strains with amplitudes from −4%
to 4% are considered.

materials, wave functions and energies at high symmetry
points are also considered as ﬁtting targets. For strained
systems, it is suﬃcient to use the strain induced band
edge splitting at high symmetry points as targets. Eﬀec-
tive masses at those points are not considered as ﬁtting
targets. Eﬀective masses in strained materials are re-
lated to the splitting of band edges and eﬀective masses
of unstrained systems. For example, the eﬀective masses
of valence bands in a strained group III-V or IV mate-
rial can be well described by a Luttinger model11. The
well known conduction band eﬀective mass change under
shear strain( with strain component xy ) can also de-
scribed by camel back model12. Those models include
the strain eﬀect as k-independent perturbation terms.
The strain induced terms correspond to the band edge
splitting at high symmetry points.

The atom type dependent onsite parameters are listed
on table I. Table II and IV summarizes the bond length
dependent onsite and interatomic coupling parameters

FIG. 6:
Contribution of p orbitals to the top valence
bands(a) and contribution of s orbitals to the lowest con-
duction bands of InAs. The p orbitals of In and As atoms
contribute to the top valence bands. When lattice constant
change one percent, p orbitals contribution are changed by
less than 0.0002. The s orbitals of In and As atoms contribute
to the lowest conduction bands. When lattice constant change
one percent, s orbitals contribution are changed by less than
0.02.

For hydrostatically strained materials, ﬁtting targets
includes band structures, important band edges, eﬀec-
tive masses and wave functions at high symmetry points.
Those targets were considered in previous work (ref.24)
in order to get ETB parameters for unstrained bulk mate-
rials. To extract ETB parameters for arbitrarily strained

At Γ point, 6 top most valence bands and 2 lowest conduction

shown. The lowest conduction band at L points are included
in the ﬁgures. The valence bands at X and L points are

respectively. From table IV, it can be seen that inter-
atomic parameters for diﬀerent III-V materials have sim-
ilar values. Multipole dependent onsite parameters and
interatomic coupling parameters are listed in table III
and V respectively. The parameters P ’s Q’s and S’s in
principle contain the same number of parameters as in-
teratomic interaction parameter V . However, it turns
out that it is suﬃcient to consider only s− p, s− d, p− p
and d − d interactions for parameters P ’s, Q’s and S’s.
Others such as s∗ − p, s∗ − d and p − d interactions are
constrained to zero.

C. Unstrained and strained materials

Fig. 3 and 4 show band structures of unstrained bulk
band structure for group IV and III-V materials. The
presented materials include Si, Ga, XP, XAs and XSb
with X = Al,Ga,In. It can be seen that the ETB results of
unstrained bulk group IV and III-V materials match cor-
responding HSE06 results well. Tables VI,VII,VIII and
IX compare the eﬀective masses and critical band edges
between ETB and HSE06 calculations. Most of the eﬀec-

tices. (a) Si/Ge superlattice with 4 layers in the unit cell; (b)

tive masses of important valence and conduction valleys
are within 10% error. Eﬀective masses of higher conduc-
tion valleys like ml or L valleys tend to have larger error.
Discrepancies of critical band edges at high symmetric
points between ETB and HSE06 are within 10meV.

Fig.5 shows Si band structures under hydrostatic
strain. The hydrostatic strain does not change crystal
symmetry, thus the degeneracy at high symmetry points
conserve under hydro static strain. However, it can be
observed by comparing Fig.5 (a) and (b) that the hydro-
static strains change the band edges signiﬁcantly. With a
lattice constant of 5.4˚A, the lowest conduction bands of
Si are X valleys, the L and s-type Γ valley (Ecs(G)) are
of more than 1eV above the X valleys. However, with a
larger lattice constant of 5.8˚A, the L and Γ gap descend
dramatically , while the X gap even increase slightly.
The change of band gaps are shown clearly by Fig.5 (c),
it can be seen that at around 5.8˚A, the L and s-type Γ
valley become lower than the X valleys. As the lattice
constant increase more, Si becomes a direct gap material
(lowest conduction band is Γ valley). In fact, if the lattice
constant is suﬃciently large, Si becomes a metal as the
s-type Γ valley conduction band become even lower than
the valence bands. The trend shown by Fig.5 is valid for

other group IV and III-V materials which have diamond
or zincblende structures.

Fig. 7 shows the band edge splitting at Γ, X and L
points of InAs under diﬀerent strains (strain produced
by uniaxial stress along [123] direction and biaxial strain
along [111]). The strain presented were not considered
in the ﬁtting process and produces complicated bandedge
splitting especially for X and L valleys. It can be seen
that the ETB band edge splittings are in good agree-
ment with the corresponding HSE06 results. To quan-
titatively estimate the discrepancies between ETB and
HSE06 calculations for strained materials, the deforma-
tion potentials are extracted from both ETB and HSE06
results. The deformation potentials of group IV and III-
V materials are compared in tables X and XII. It can be
seen that the important deformation potentials by ETB
agree well with the HSE06 results. The discrepancies
are within 2%. The deformation potentials bv and dv
describe the band edge splitting of valence bands under
diagonal and oﬀ-diagonal strain components respectively.
Ξ001 and Ξ110 describe the conduction band edge split-
ting at X points due to diagonal and oﬀ-diagonal strain
components respectively. The deﬁnition of those defor-
mation potentials are speciﬁed in Appendix C.

D. Tight binding analysis of superlattices

To investigate the transferability of our ETB parame-
ters,band structures of group IV and group III-V super-
lattices are calculated by both ETB and HSE06 models.
The atom structures of the superlattices considered in
this work are shown in Fig.8. The superlattices consid-
ered in this work grow along 001 direction. Those super-
lattices contain only a few layers of atoms (with thickness
from about 0.5 nm to 1.5 nm). To model those superlat-
tices by ETB method, in principle, self-consistent ETB
calculations with Possion equation should be applied if
there is charge redistribution in the hetero-structures.

However the presented superlattices turn out to be ei-
ther type I or type II heterojunctions as the ab-initio
band structures shows band gap of at least 0.5eV for all
the presented superlattices. The charge redistribution in
type I or II heterostructures under zero temperature is
negligible because the valence bands of both materials
are perfectly occupied. The negligible build-in ﬁeld can
also be realized by looking at the envelope of ab-initio lo-
cal potentials33,34. Thus, the presented ETB calculations
for superlattices all assumes zero build-in potentials. The
parameter δdij are all set to zero in order to compare with
ab-initio results.

Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 show the comparison of band struc-
tures of Si/Ge and Arsenides superlattices by ETB and
Hybrid functional calculations respectively. In these ﬁg-
ures, band structures of Si/Ge, GaAs/AlAs, GaAs/InAs
and InAs/AlAs superlattices are presented. In both ETB
and hybrid functional calculations, zero temperature is
assumed. For each type of superlattices, band structure
of two diﬀerent unit cells are shown. It can be seen that
the ETB band structures are in good agreement for en-
ergy from -2eV to 1eV above lowest conduction bands.
ETB band structures are obtained with the parameters
given by previous sections without introducing extra ﬁt-
ting parameters. From Fig. 9 and Fig. 10, it can be seen
that ETB calculations without solving Poisson equation
(zero build-in potential is added ) match the HSE06 re-
sults well. More complicated cases include InAs/GaSb
superlattices which contain no common cations or anions
at material interface. The InAs/GaSb superlattices with
4 atomic layers can also be interpreted as InSb/GaAs su-
perlattice. From Fig. 12 (a) and (b), it can be seen that
ETB calculations match the HSE06 results well even for
interfaces with no common cations or anions.
In 001 superlattices, the primitive unit cells are de-
ﬁned by vectors u1 = [0.5, 0.5, 0]a, u2 = [−0.5, 0.5, 0]a
and u3 = [0, 0, N ]a, where N can be any integer number.
According to the theory of Brillouin zone folding36–39, the

FIG. 10: Band structures of Arsenides superlattices by ETB and HSE06 calculations. Presented band structures include band
structures of superlattices of 001 AlAs/GaAs((a),(d)), InAs/GaAs((b),(e)) and InAs/AlAs((c),(f)). Upper ﬁgures correspond
to supercells which contain 4 atoms(Fig 8 (a)), while lower ﬁgures corresponds to supercells with 8 atoms (Fig 8 (b)).

X points along [001] direction in a fcc Brillouin zone is
folded to the k = [0, 0, 0] point in the Brillouin zone of su-
perlattices. As a result, the lowest few conduction states
at k = [0, 0, 0] of 001 superlattices can have the feature
of Γ and X conduction valleys in pure materials. The
Γ and X conduction valleys can be easily distinguished
by the corresponding ETB wave functions. Considering
the valleys in a fcc Brillouin zone, the lowest conduction
states at Γ point are dominated by s and s* orbitals;
while the conduction states at X points have signiﬁcant
contribution from both s and p orbitals. This can also be
realized by the eﬀective masses of the valleys. The folded
X conduction valleys have anisotropic eﬀective masses as
it is shown in Fig.10 (a) and (d); while the Γ valley have
isotropic eﬀective masses as in Fig.10 (b) and (e). It can
be seen from Fig.10 that the lowest conduction state in
AlAs/GaAs superlattices have the feature of X conduc-
tion valley; while in InAs/GaAs and InAs/AlAs super-

lattices, the lowest conduction state has the feature of Γ
valley.

Fig. 9 (c), Fig.11 and Fig.12 (c) compare the ETB
band gap of for diﬀerent superlattices with corresponding
HSE06 results. Fig. 9 (c) shows the band gaps in Si/Ge
superlattices. The compared superlattices in Fig.11
include superlattices with common anions (XP/YP,
XAs/YAs and XSb/YSb) and superlattices with common
cations (AlX/AlY, GaX/GaY and InX/InY). Fig.12 (c)
shows the band gaps of selected AX/BY type superlat-
tices, including InAs/GaSb, InAs/AlSb, InP/GaAs and
InP/AlAs. For the superlattices shown in the ﬁgure,
averaged lattice constant is used to create the unit cell
of the superlattices since lattice mismatch always exists
in superlattices.
It can be seen that ETB methods in
this work delivered accurate band gaps for ultra small
superlattices. For ultra small superlattices, the band
gaps are not always monotonic functions of thickness.

FIG. 11: Band gaps of III-V superlattices by ETB and HSE06 calculations. The presented band gaps include superlattices of
(a) XP/YP , (b) XAs/YAs and (c) XSb/YSb with ( X and Y stand for diﬀerent cations, X,Y = Al, Ga or In) and (e) AlX/AlY
, (f) GaX/GaY and (g) InX/InY with ( X and Y stand for diﬀerent anions, X,Y = P, As or Sb). The ETB band gaps of
diﬀerent superlattices show good agreement with HSE06 results, demonstrating the ETB parameters have good transferability.

FIG. 12: Band structures InAs/GaSb superlattices by ETB and HSE06 calculations. Present ﬁgures include band structures
of 4 layer (a) and 8 layer (b) InAs/GaSb superlattices. Band gaps of AX/BY type superlattices are shown in (c); InAs/GaSb,
InAs/AlSb, InP/GaAs and InP/AlAs superlattices are considered.

This non-monotonic dependency of band gaps can be
seen in many of the presented superlattices which have
common cations (Fig.11 (d), (e) and (f)). The ETB
band gap of superlattices agree well with corresponding
HSE06. For superlattices which contain common cations
or anions (shown in Fig.11), the largest discrepancy of
about 0.03eV appears in GaP/GaSb superlattices. While
the discrepancy of superlattices which contain no com-
mon cation or anions, the largest discrepancy reaches a
slightly higher of about 0.05eV. These comparisons sug-
gest that the ETB model and parameters by this work
has good transferability.

IV. CONCLUSION

Environment dependent ETB model with nearest neigh-
bor interactions is developed. ETB parameters for group
IV and III-V semiconductors are parameterized with
respect to HSE06 calculations. Good agreements are
achieve for unstrained and arbitrarily strained materials.
The ETB parameters show good transferability when ap-
plied to ultra-small superlattices. The ETB band struc-
tures of superlattices match the corresponding HSE06
result well. Tight binding band gaps of varieties of su-
perlattices show less than 0.1 eV discrepancies compared
with HSE06 calculations. This work demonstrated that
an ETB model with good transferability can be achieved
with nearest neighbor interactions for group IV and III-V
materials.

It can be seen that the terms with pij
or pji has resemblance with Slater Koster formula of
Vxy = xy (Vppσ − Vppπ). To make the expression sim-
pler, in this work, only the terms with pij,k and pji,k(cid:48) are
preserved. Let
