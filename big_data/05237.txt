THE SHARP THRESHOLD FOR THE DUARTE MODEL

B´ELA BOLLOB ´AS, HUGO DUMINIL-COPIN, ROBERT MORRIS, AND PAUL SMITH

Abstract. The class of critical bootstrap percolation models in two dimensions
was recently introduced by Bollob´as, Smith and Uzzell, and the critical threshold
for percolation was determined up to a constant factor for all such models by the
authors of this paper. Here we develop and reﬁne the techniques introduced in
that paper in order to determine a sharp threshold for the Duarte model. This
resolves a question of Mountford from 1995, and is the ﬁrst result of its type for
a model with drift.

1. Introduction

In this paper we resolve a 20 year old problem of Mountford [20] by determining
the sharp threshold for a particular monotone cellular automaton related to the
classical 2-neighbour bootstrap percolation model. This model was ﬁrst studied
by Duarte [11], and is the most fundamental model for which a sharp threshold
had not yet been determined.
Indeed, our main theorem is the ﬁrst result of its
type for a critical bootstrap model that exhibits ‘drift’, and is an important step
towards a complete understanding of sharp thresholds in two-dimensional bootstrap
percolation.

We will begin by stating our main result, and postpone a discussion of the back-

ground and history to Section 1.1. The Duarte model 1 is deﬁned as follows. Let

D := n(cid:8)(−1, 0), (0, 1)(cid:9),(cid:8)(−1, 0), (0,−1)(cid:9),(cid:8)(0, 1), (0,−1)(cid:9)o,

denote the collection of 2-element subsets of (cid:8)(−1, 0), (0, 1), (0,−1)(cid:9), and let Z2
denote the two-dimensional discrete torus. Given a set A ⊂ Z2
sites, set A0 = A, and deﬁne for each t > 0,

n
n of initially infected

At+1 := At ∪(cid:8)x ∈ Z2

n : x + X ⊂ At for some X ∈ D(cid:9).

Thus, a site x becomes infected at time t + 1 if the translate by x of one of the
sets of D is already entirely infected at time t, and infected sites remain infected
forever. The set of eventually infected sites is called the closure of A, and is denoted
by [A]D :=St>0 At. We say that A percolates if [A]D = Z2

Let us say that a set A ⊂ Z2

n is included
in A independently with probability p, and denote the corresponding probability
measure by Pp. The critical probability is deﬁned to be

Our proof of Theorem 1.1 relies heavily on the techniques introduced in [5], where
we proved a weaker result in much greater generality (see Theorem 1.5, below). The
key innovation of this paper is the use of non-polygonal ‘droplets’ (see Section 3),
which seem to be necessary for the proof, and signiﬁcantly complicate the analysis.
In particular, we will have to work very hard in order to obtain suﬃciently strong
bounds on the probabilities of suitable ‘crossing events’ (see Section 4). On the
other hand, by encoding the growth using a single variable, these droplets somewhat
simplify some other aspects of the proof.

1.1. Background and motivation. The study of bootstrap processes on graphs
goes back over 35 years to the work of Chalupa, Leath and Reich [10], and numerous
speciﬁc models have been considered in the literature. Motivated by applications to
statistical physics, for example the Glauber dynamics of the Ising model [15,19] and
kinetically constrained spin models [7], the underlying graph is often taken to be d-
dimensional, and the initial set A is usually chosen randomly. The most extensively-
studied of these processes is the classical ‘r-neighbour model’ in d dimensions, in
which a vertex of Zd becomes infected as soon as it acquires at least r already-
infected nearest neighbours. The sharp threshold for this model in full generality
was obtained by Balogh, Bollob´as, Duminil-Copin and Morris [3] in 2012, building
on a series of earlier partial results in [1, 4, 8, 9, 17, 21]. Their result stated that

as n → ∞, for some explicit constant λ(d, r), where the left-hand side is deﬁned
as in (1), except replacing D by N d
r(cid:1) r-element subsets of
the neighbourhood of 0 in Zd. The special case d = r = 2, a result analogous to
Theorem 1.1 for the 2-neighbour model in Z2, was obtained by Holroyd [17] in 2003,
who showed that in fact λ(2, 2) = π2/18.

More recently, a much more general family of bootstrap-type processes was in-
troduced and studied by Bollob´as, Smith and Uzzell [6]. To deﬁne this family (for

THE SHARP THRESHOLD FOR THE DUARTE MODEL

simplicity, in two dimensions), let U = {X1, . . . , Xm} be a ﬁnite collection of ﬁnite
subsets of Z2 \ {0}, and replace D by U in each of the deﬁnitions above. The key
discovery of [6] was that the family of such monotone cellular automata can be
partitioned into three classes, each with completely diﬀerent behaviour. Roughly
speaking, one of the following holds:

• U is ‘supercritical’ and has polynomial critical probability.
• U is ‘critical’ and has poly-logarithmic critical probability.
• U is ‘subcritical’ and has critical probability bounded away from zero.

We remark that the ﬁrst two statements were proved in [6], and the third by Balister,
Bollob´as, Przykucki and Smith [2]. Note that both the Duarte model and the 2-
neighbour model are critical, while the 1-neighbour model is supercritical and the
3-neighbour model is subcritical.2

For critical models, much more precise bounds were obtained recently by the
authors of this paper [5]. Since this paper should be seen as a direct descendent of
that work, we will spend a little time developing the deﬁnitions necessary for the
statement of the main theorem of [5].

Deﬁnition 1.2. For each u ∈ S1, let Hu := {x ∈ Z2 : hx, ui < 0} denote the
discrete half-plane whose boundary is perpendicular to u. Given U, deﬁne

S = S(U) = (cid:8)u ∈ S1 : [Hu]U = Hu(cid:9).

The model U is said to be critical if there exists a semicircle in S1 that has ﬁnite
intersection with S, and if every open semicircle in S1 has non-empty intersection
with S.

We call the elements of S stable directions. Note that for the Duarte model

S(D) = (cid:8)u ∈ S1 : θ(u) ∈ {0} ∪ [π/2, 3π/2](cid:9),

where θ(u) is the (canonical) angle of u in radians. Thus the open semicircle
(−π/2, π/2) contains exactly one stable direction, and every other open semicir-
cle contains an inﬁnite number of stable directions. The next deﬁnition allows us to
distinguish between diﬀerent types of stable direction.

Deﬁnition 1.3. Given a rational direction u ∈ S1, the diﬃculty of u is
α(u) := (min(cid:8)α+(u), α−(u)(cid:9) if α+(u) < ∞ and α−(u) < ∞

otherwise,

∞

where α+(u) (respectively α−(u)) is deﬁned to be the minimum (possibly inﬁnite)
cardinality of a set Z ⊂ Z2 such that [Hu ∪ Z]U contains inﬁnitely many sites of the
line ℓu := {x ∈ Z2 : hx, ui = 0} to the right (resp. left) of the origin.

2There also exist many non-trivial examples of supercritical and subcritical models.

Writing u+ for the isolated element of S(D) (so θ(u+) = 0), we have α(u+) = 1
and α(u) = ∞ for every u ∈ S(D)\{u+}. More precisely, writing u∗ for the element
of S1 with θ(u∗) = π/2, we have
α+(u∗) = α−(−u∗) = 1

α−(u∗) = α+(−u∗) = ∞,

and α+(u) = α−(u) = ∞ for every u ∈ S(D) \ {u+, u∗,−u∗}. Writing C for the
collection of open semicircles of S1, we deﬁne the diﬃculty of U to be

and

α = α(U) := min

C∈C

max
u∈C

α(u),

(2)

so α(D) = 1. The ﬁnal deﬁnition we need is as follows.
Deﬁnition 1.4. A critical update family U is balanced if there exists a closed semi-
circle C such that α(u) 6 α for all u ∈ C. It is said to be unbalanced otherwise.

Note that D is unbalanced, since every closed semicircle in S1 contains a point of

inﬁnite diﬃculty. The main theorem of [5] was as follows.

Theorem 1.5. Let U be a critical two-dimensional bootstrap percolation update
family and let α = α(U).

as was ﬁrst proved by Mountford [20]. Sharp thresholds (that is, upper and lower
bounds which diﬀer by a factor of 1 + o(1)) are known in some special cases. For
example, Duminil-Copin and Holroyd [13] obtained such a result for symmetric,
balanced, threshold models (that is, balanced models in which U consists of the
r-subsets of some centrally symmetric set), and Duminil-Copin and van Enter [12]
determined the sharp threshold for the unbalanced model with update rule A con-
sisting of the 3-subsets of(cid:8)(−2, 0), (−1, 0), (0, 1), (0,−1), (1, 0), (2, 0)(cid:9), proving that

n,A(cid:1) = (cid:18) 1

12

+ o(1)(cid:19)(log log n)2

log n

as n → ∞. This was, until now, the only sharp threshold result known for an
unbalanced critical bootstrap process in two dimensions.
The key property which makes the process with update rule A easier to deal with
than the Duarte model is symmetry, in particular the fact that α+(u∗) = α−(u∗) = 2.
As a result of this symmetry, the droplets are rectangles, and there is a natural way
to partition vertical growth into steps of size one. The Duarte model also exhibits

(1) If U is balanced, then

symmetry, but of a weaker kind: there exists a set of four pairwise-opposite stable
directions. Theorem 1.1 is the ﬁrst result of its kind for a model (balanced or
unbalanced) that only exhibits this weaker notion of symmetry.

The proof of Theorem 1.1 follows in outline that of Theorem 1.5 in the case
of unbalanced ‘drift’ models (that is, models for which α(u∗) = α(−u∗) = ∞),
with a few important diﬀerences. In particular, we will use the ‘method of iterated
hierarchies’ (see Section 3), but the droplets we use to control the growth will not
be polygons. Instead, they will grow upwards as they grow rightwards; crucially,
however, in a deterministic fashion. This means that their size will depend on only
one parameter (their height), rather than two, as in the case of a rectangle. As
noted above, this has the pleasantly surprising consequence of simplifying some of
the analysis, although (rather less surprisingly) its overall eﬀect is to signiﬁcantly
increase the number of technical diﬃculties that will need to be overcome, as we
shall see in Sections 3 and 4. This is the ﬁrst time that non-polygonal droplets have
been used in bootstrap percolation, and we consider this innovation to be the key
contribution of this paper.

The rest of this paper is organised as follows. We begin in the next section by
giving the (relatively easy) proof of the upper bound in Theorem 1.1. Then, in Sec-
tion 3, we prepare for the proof of the lower bound by deﬁning precisely the droplet
described above, by stating a number of other key deﬁnitions, and by recalling some
fundamental deﬁnitions from [5] and [17]. The most technical part of the paper is
Section 4, in which we prove precise bounds on the probability that a droplet grows
to ‘span’ a slightly larger droplet. In Section 5 we use the ‘method of iterated hierar-
chies’ to bound the probability that relatively small droplets are internally spanned,
and in Section 6 we deduce the corresponding bound for large droplets, and hence
complete the proof of Theorem 1.1. Finally, in Section 7, we discuss possible exten-
sions of our techniques to more general two-dimensional processes, and the (much
harder) problem of extending these methods to higher dimensions.

2. The upper bound

The upper bound in Theorem 1.1 is relatively straightforward. We will prove the
following proposition, which easily implies it (the deduction is given at the end of
the section). Given a rectangle R with sides parallel to the axes, let ∂(R) denote its
right-hand side.

Proposition 2.1. For every ε > 0, there exists p0(ε) > 0 such that the following
holds. Let 0 < p 6 p0(ε), set a = 1/p5 and b = 1/p3, and let R be a rectangle of
width a and height b. Then

The growth structure we use to prove Proposition 2.1 is illustrated in Figure 1.
We will deﬁne rectangles R0, . . . , Rk, where k := 1/ε, and bound the probability
that R0 ⊂ [R0 ∩ A], and that R0 then grows to infect the other rectangles in turn.
(Note that if 1/ε is not an integer then we may replace ε by 1/⌈1/ε⌉.)

Figure 1. Our proof of the upper bound of Theorem 1.1 shows that
one (asymptotically) optimal route to percolation of Z2
n is, somewhere
in the torus, for infection to spread in the manner depicted in the ﬁg-
ure. From R0 infection spreads rightwards through R1, then upwards
from R1 to R′
1 (which is the union of R1 and the dashed region above),
then rightwards again into R2, and so on.

Let us denote the discrete rectangle with opposite corners (a, b) and (c, d) by

R(cid:0)(a, b), (c, d)(cid:1) := (cid:8)(x, y) ∈ Z2 : a 6 x 6 c and b 6 y 6 d(cid:9).

Thus the Ri are rectangles whose heights grow linearly and widths exponentially in

i contains Ri and has
height equal to that of Ri+1. The set-up is depicted in Figure 1.

We ﬁrst prove the following easy lemma.

Proof. Note ﬁrst that, since a single infected site in each column is suﬃcient for
horizontal growth, we have

Pp(cid:0)Ri ⊂ [∂(R′

i−1) ∪ (Ri ∩ A)](cid:1) > (cid:0)1 − (1 − p)ih(cid:1)wi > (cid:0)1 − piε(cid:1)wi > e−2/p,

since pε is suﬃciently small. Now suppose that Ri is already completely infected,
and observe that a single element of A in the row two above Ri causes all elements
to its right in these two rows to become infected (see Figure 2). Note that the
probability of ﬁnding at least one site of A in a collection of wi/h sites is

1 − (1 − p)wi/h > 1 − exp(cid:18) −

since εpε2 log(1/p) < 1/2. It follows that

Pp(cid:0)R0 ⊂ [R0 ∩ A](cid:1) > p⌊h/2⌋+1,

since if every second element of R0 is in A then R0 ⊂ [R0 ∩ A]. Therefore

Pp(cid:0)∂( ˆR0) ⊂ [ ˆR0 ∩ A](cid:1) > p⌊h/2⌋+1 ·

since p is suﬃciently small and εk = 1. Recalling that h = ε
p , and noting that
(1 + 3ε2)(1 + ε) < 1 + 2ε since ε is suﬃciently small, the claimed bound follows. (cid:3)

We can now easily complete the proof of Proposition 2.1. Indeed, once we have
infected ∂( ˆR0) it is relatively easy to grow p−2−ε steps to the right, then p−1−ε/2
steps upwards, then p−5 steps right, and ﬁnally p−3 steps up. For completeness we
spell out the details below.

We will show that, with high probability as n → ∞, a p-random subset A ⊂ Z2
percolates. Observe ﬁrst that Z2
n contains Ω(cid:0)p8n2(cid:1) disjoint translates of the rectangle

To complete the proof, simply observe that with probability at least

1 − 2n2(cid:0)1 − p(cid:1)1/p3

there does not exist a (horizontal or vertical) line of 1/p3 consecutive sites of Z2

in Z2

n, and so we are done.

3. Droplets, spanning, and iterated hierarchies

3.1. Droplets and the growth of infected regions. We are now ready to start
the main part of the proof of Theorem 1.1: the proof of the lower bound on the
critical probability. We begin by formally introducing the curved droplets we shall
use to control the growth of an infection. This will then allow us to state the key
result (Proposition 3.8) we need in the lead up to Theorem 1.1. Later, in Section 3.2,
we establish certain deterministic facts about ‘internally spanned droplets’ (see Def-
inition 3.7 below), and in Section 3.3 we brieﬂy recall the deﬁnitions and properties
we shall need for the ‘method of iterated hierarchies’.

We begin by deﬁning a droplet. The deﬁnition is quite subtle, and is chosen
both to reﬂect the typical growth of the infected set, and to facilitate our proof of
Theorem 1.1. For simplicity, we will work in Z2 (and R2) throughout this section,

though all of the deﬁnitions and lemmas below can be easily extended to the setting
of Z2
n.
Deﬁnition 3.1. Given ε > 0 and p > 0, a Duarte region D∗ ⊂ R2 is a set of the
form
(5)

for some a, b, w ∈ R, where f : [0,∞) → [0,∞) is the function

D∗ = (a, b) +(cid:8)(x, y) ∈ R2 : 0 6 x 6 w, |y| 6 f (x)(cid:9),

A Duarte droplet (or simply, as we shall usually say, a droplet) D ⊂ Z2 is the
intersection of a Duarte region with Z2. Thus, D is a Duarte droplet if and only if
there exists a Duarte region D∗ such that D = D∗ ∩ Z2.

Let us make an easy but important observation.

Observation 3.2. Given a bounded set U ⊂ R2, there is a (unique) minimal Duarte
region D∗(U) containing U.

If K ⊂ Z2 is ﬁnite, we deﬁne the minimal droplet containing K to be D(K) :=
D∗(K)∩ Z2. Notice that K ⊂ D(K) and that D is the identity function on droplets.
Observation 3.2 allows us to make the following deﬁnitions. Given a bounded set
U ⊂ R2 and a, b, w such that the right-hand side of (5) is D∗(U), we deﬁne the
height and width of U by h(U) := 2f (w) + 1 and w(U) := w, respectively. We call
the point (a, b) the source of U. Letting

c := sup{x ∈ R : (x, y) ∈ U for some y ∈ R},

we write

∂(U) := (cid:8)(c, y) ∈ U : y ∈ R(cid:9).

Informally we think of ∂(U) as being the right-hand side of U.3 We can now make
another easy but important observation, the proof of which is immediate from the
convexity of f .

It is worth noting that the reason for deﬁning Duarte regions as well as (Duarte)
droplets, and for deﬁning heights and widths of droplets in terms of regions, is that
if one were to deﬁne everything discretely then certain key lemmas below would be
false. For example, it would be more natural to deﬁne D(K) to be the smallest
droplet containing K, but if one were to do that then Lemma 3.12 would be false.
(It would be true with ‘+2’ in place of ‘+1’, but that would be too weak for the
application in Lemma 3.13.)

2, then

One disadvantage of deﬁning droplets in this way is that it makes the following

lemma non-trivial.

3This generalizes the deﬁnition of ∂(R) for a rectangle R, given in Section 2.

THE SHARP THRESHOLD FOR THE DUARTE MODEL

Lemma 3.4. There are at most wO(1) droplets D such that the source of D belongs
to (0, 1] × (0, 1] and the x-coordinate of the elements of ∂(D) is equal to w.

The proof of the lemma is a simple consequence of the following extremal result
for set systems. Let us say4 that a set F ⊂ P[n] is a bi-chain if it has the following
property: for every distinct A, B ∈ F , there exists k ∈ [n] such that the following
two conditions hold: (a) A ∩ {1, . . . , k} is a subset of B ∩ {1, . . . , k}, or vice-versa,
and (b) A ∩ {k + 1, . . . , n} is a subset of B ∩ {k + 1, . . . , n}, or vice-versa.
Lemma 3.5. Let F ⊂ P[n] be a bi-chain. Then |F| 6 nO(1).
Proof. If A, B ∈ F are distinct and have the same cardinality, then without loss
of generality we may assume that A ∩ {1, . . . , k} ⊂ B ∩ {1, . . . , k} and B ∩ {k +
1, . . . , n} ⊂ A ∩ {k + 1, . . . , n}. This implies that the sum of the elements of A is
strictly greater than the sum of the elements of B. So summing over the possible
sizes of |A|, we have |F| 6 n3.
Alternatively, one may note that the bi-chain condition implies no set T ⊂ [n]
of size 3 is shattered by F . To see this, suppose T = {i, j, k} is such a set, with
i < j < k. Then there exist A, B ∈ F such that A ∩ T = {i, k} and B ∩ T = {j},
which contradicts the condition. Hence, by the Sauer-Shelah Theorem, we must
have |F| 6 O(n2). (Note this is optimal up to the constant factor.)5
(cid:3)
Proof of Lemma 3.4. Firstly, given a droplet D, let top(D) be the set containing the
topmost site of each column of D, and similarly deﬁne bottom(D). It is easy to see
that a droplet D is uniquely determined by the set top(D) ∪ bottom(D).
Let A be the set of droplets D whose source is contained in the unit square
(0, 1] × (0, 1] and such that the x-coordinate of the elements of ∂(D) is w. For each
D ∈ A, there are (at most) 2w possibilities for top(D), since there are only 2 choices
for the element of top(D) at each x coordinate (this is because f ′(x) < 1 for all
x > 0). Thus there is a natural bijection between the set Atop :=(cid:8)top(D) : D ∈ A(cid:9)
and a subset F of P[n] (the power set of {1, . . . , n}). Moreover, F is a bi-chain.
This is because any two translations of the curve (cid:8)(x, f (x)) : x > 0(cid:9) intersect in
at most one point. Hence, by Lemma 3.5, we have |Atop| = |F| 6 wO(1). Deﬁning
Abottom similarly, it follows that |A| 6 |Atop| · |Abottom| 6 wO(1).

(cid:3)

Let us brieﬂy collect together a few simple facts about f , which we shall use

repeatedly throughout the paper.

Observation 3.6. The function f has the following properties for all ε > 0 and
p > 0:
(a) f is strictly increasing on [0,∞).
(b) f ′ is strictly decreasing (and hence f is convex) on [0,∞).
4We write P[n] for the power set of [n].
5The ﬁrst proof given here is due to Paul Balister and the second is due to Bhargav Narayanan.

The authors would like to thank both for bringing these proofs to our attention.

(d) If f (x) 6 1/4p then

.

Next, let us record a few conventions, also to be used throughout the paper:

• ε > 0 is an arbitrary and suﬃciently small constant, and p > 0 is suﬃciently
small depending on ε, with p → 0 as n → ∞.
• Constants implicit in O(·) notation (and its variants) are absolute: they do
not depend on p, n, ε, k, or any other parameter.
• A denotes a p-random subset of Z2
n.
• [K] := [K]D for K ⊂ Z2
n (or K ⊂ Z2).
The following key deﬁnition is based on an idea ﬁrst introduced in [3, 4].6

Deﬁnition 3.7. A droplet D is said to be internally spanned if there exists a set
L ⊂ [D ∩ A] that is connected in the graph Z2, and such that D = D(L). We write
I ×(D) for the event that D is internally spanned.

We can now state the key intermediate result in the proof of Theorem 1.1.

Proposition 3.8. For every ε > 0, there exists p0(ε) > 0 such that the following
holds. If 0 < p 6 p0(ε), and D is a droplet with

then

Pp(cid:0)I ×(D)(cid:1) 6 p(1−ε)h(D)/4.

(6)

In order to deduce the theorem from this result, we will show (see Lemma 3.14)
that if A percolates then there exists a pair (D1, D2) of disjointly internally spanned
droplets, satisfying

max(cid:8)h(D1), h(D2)(cid:9) 6

with d(D1, D2) 6 2. The theorem then follows from Proposition 3.8 by using the
van den Berg–Kesten inequality and taking the union bound over all such pairs.

Our proof of Proposition 3.8 uses the framework of ‘hierarchies’ (see Section 3.3),
which have become a standard tool in the study of bootstrap percolation since their
introduction by Holroyd [17] (see e.g. [3, 12, 16]). However, in order to limit the
number of possible hierarchies (which is needed, since we will use the union bound),
the ‘seeds’ of our hierarchies must have size roughly 1/p. This is a problem, because
(unlike in the 2-neighbour setting) there is no easy way to prove a suﬃciently strong

6We emphasize this deﬁnition does not correspond to the use of the term ‘internally spanned’

in much of the older literature, where it was used to mean that [D ∩ A]D = D.

THE SHARP THRESHOLD FOR THE DUARTE MODEL

bound on the probability that such a seed is internally spanned.7 Moreover, we shall
need a similar bound in order to control the probability of vertical growth, due to
the (potential) existence of ‘saver’ droplets (see Deﬁnition 4.6).

We resolve this problem by using the ‘method of iterated hierarchies’. This tech-
nique, which was introduced by the authors in [5], allows one to prove upper bounds
on the probability that a droplet is internally spanned by induction on its height.
It is speciﬁcally designed to overcome the issue of there being too many droplets for
the union bound to work. The inductive step itself is proved using hierarchies.

Our induction hypothesis is as follows.

Deﬁnition 3.9. For each k > 0, let IH(k) denote the following statement:

for every droplet D with h(D) 6 p−(2/3)k (log 1/p)−1, where

Pp(cid:0)I ×(D)(cid:1) 6 p(1−εk)h(D)/2

εk = ε2 · (3/4)k.

(7)

(8)

It is no accident that the factor of 1/4 in the exponent in (6) has become a factor
of 1/2 in (7): this has to do with the transition, as a droplet reaches height 1/p, to it
being likely that the droplet grows one more step to the right (see Proposition 6.1,
and also compare with Lemma 2.3).

The statement we need for the proof of Proposition 3.8 is IH(0); we will prove
that this holds in two steps. First, we will prove that IH(k) holds for all suﬃciently
large k (see Lemma 5.1); then we will show that IH(k) ⇒ IH(k − 1) for every
k > 1 (see Lemma 5.2). The ﬁrst step will follow relatively easily from the fact (see
Lemma 3.13) that if D is internally spanned, then |D ∩ A| > h(D)/2. To prove the
second step, we will apply the method of hierarchies, using the induction hypothesis
to bound the probability that smaller droplets are internally spanned.

3.2. Spanning and extremal properties of droplets. In this section we will
recall from [5] the ‘spanning algorithm’, and deduce some of its key consequences.
In particular we will prove that critical droplets exist and, in the next section, we
will show that they have ‘good and satisﬁed’ hierarchies. In order to get started,
we need a way of saying that two sets of sites are suﬃciently close to interact in the
Duarte model.

Deﬁnition 3.10. Deﬁne a graph Gstrong with vertex set Z2 and edge set E, where

(cid:8)(a1, b1), (a2, b2)(cid:9) ∈ E if and only if
We say that a set of vertices K ⊂ Z2 is strongly connected if the subgraph of Gstrong
induced by K is connected.

|a1 − a2| + |b1 − b2| 6 2.

|a1 − a2| 6 1

and

7This is, roughly speaking, because a droplet of this height is too long.

We are ready to recall the spanning algorithm of [5, Section 6], modiﬁed in accor-

dance with Deﬁnitions 3.1 and 3.10.

1 , . . . , K 0

The spanning algorithm. Let K = {x1, . . . , xk0} be a ﬁnite set of sites. Set
K0 := {K 0
k0}, where K 0
j := {xj} for each 1 6 j 6 k0. Set t := 0, and repeat
the following steps until STOP:
i , K t

1. If there are two sets K t

j ∈ Kt such that the set

is strongly connected, then set

and set t := t + 1.

i ∪ K t
(cid:2)K t
j(cid:3)
j}(cid:1) ∪(cid:8)K t
Kt+1 := (cid:0)Kt \ {K t

i , K t

i ∪ K t
j(cid:9),

(9)

2. Otherwise set T := t and STOP.

The output of the algorithm is the span of K,

hKi := (cid:8)D(cid:0)[K T

1 ](cid:1), . . . , D(cid:0)[K T

k ](cid:1)(cid:9),

where k = k0 − T . Finally, we say that a droplet D is spanned by a set K if there
exists K ′ ⊂ K such that D ∈ hK ′i.

We will need a few more-or-less standard consequences of the algorithm above.

We begin with a basic but key lemma (cf. [5, Lemma 6.8]).

Lemma 3.11. A droplet D is internally spanned if and only if D ∈ hD ∩ Ai.
Proof. For every ﬁnite set K, we have

hKi = (cid:8)D(K1), . . . , D(Kk)(cid:9),

where K1, . . . , Kk are the strongly connected components of [K]. Applying this to
K = D ∩ A, we see that D ∈ hD ∩ Ai if and only if D(L) = D for some strongly
connected component L of [D ∩ A]. But [D ∩ A] ⊂ D, and so this is equivalent to
the event that D is internally spanned, since a subset of Z2 is strongly connected
and closed if and only if it is connected in the graph Z2 and closed.
(cid:3)

The second lemma is an approximate sub-additivity property for strongly con-
nected droplets. This lemma, and the extremal lemma which follows (Lemma 3.13),
are the main reasons for deﬁning Duarte regions, and for deﬁning the width and
height of a droplet in the ‘continuous’ way via Duarte regions.

Lemma 3.12. Let D1 and D2 be droplets such that D1 ∪ D2 is strongly connected.
Then

h(cid:0)D(D1 ∪ D2)(cid:1) 6 h(D1) + h(D2) + 1.

hb := max(cid:8) − b + f (w2) − f (w2 + a), 0(cid:9).

(By convention, we set f (x) = 0 if x < 0.) Thus, ht is the distance between the top
of ∂(D∗

and ∂(D∗) lie on the same vertical line in R2. An example is shown in Figure 3.

Since the height condition h(D∗) 6 h(D∗

points of ∂(D∗
of D∗ is deﬁned so that ∂(D∗
1) and ∂(D∗) lie in the same vertical line, it is enough
to show that h0 − f (w) 6 −f (w1). By (10), this is equivalent to h0 6 f (w2) + 1.
Now, since D1 ⊂ D∗

1 is strongly connected to D2 ⊂ D∗

2, we have

b − ⌊f (w2)⌋ − ⌊f (w2 + a)⌋ 6 2,

by comparing the bottom-most point of ∂(D∗

ht = b + f (w2) − f (w2 + a) 6 2f (w2) + 2.

Thus if hb = 0 then h0 = ht/2 6 f (w2) + 1 as required. If hb > 0 then

h0 = b < f (w2) − f (w2 + a) < f (w2) + 1,

so we are again done.

Now we move on to D∗

2) ⊂ D∗, and so by symmetry (we are no longer assuming h0 > 0) we only

that ∂(D∗

that is, we have to show that the vertical coordinate of the top-most point of ∂(D∗
2)
is at most that of the upper boundary point of D∗ in the same vertical line. If ht > 0
and hb > 0 then h0 = b and we are done by the monotonicity of f . Here we are using
the fact that w + a > w1, which is obtained by observing that a > −w2 − 1, since
D1 and D2 are strongly connected, and then by observing that w > w1 + w2 + 1
follows from f (w) = f (w1) + f (w2) + 1 by the convexity of f .
If hb = 0 then
h0 = b + f (w2) − f (w2 + a), so are we again easily done by the monotonicity of f .
Finally, if ht = 0 then b 6 0 and we are done as before.

(cid:3)

We can now deduce the following extremal result for internally spanned droplets.

Lemma 3.13. Let K ⊂ Z2 be a ﬁnite set such that [K] is strongly connected. Then

h(cid:0)D([K])(cid:1) 6 2|K| − 1.

THE SHARP THRESHOLD FOR THE DUARTE MODEL

17

In particular, if D is an internally spanned droplet, then

|D ∩ A| >

h(D) + 1

2

.

Proof. The ﬁrst assertion follows by induction on |K| from Lemma 3.12 and the
spanning algorithm. Indeed, if |K| = 1 then h(cid:0)D([K])(cid:1) = 1, as required, so assume
that |K| > 2 and assume that the result holds for all proper subsets of K.
Run the spanning algorithm with initial set K, and observe that, since [K] is
strongly connected, we have hKi = {D([K]}. Let KT −1 = {K1, K2}, and observe
that [K1], [K2] and [K1 ∪ K2] are strongly connected and |K1| + |K2| = |K|. There-
fore, by the induction hypothesis and Lemma 3.12, we have

h(cid:0)D([K])(cid:1) = h(cid:0)D([K1 ∪ K2])(cid:1) 6 h(cid:0)D([K1])(cid:1) + h(cid:0)D([K2])(cid:1) + 1

6 (cid:0)2|K1| − 1(cid:1) +(cid:0)2|K1| − 1(cid:1) + 1 = 2|K| − 1,

as required.

The second assertion of the lemma follows from the ﬁrst after noting that if D
is internally spanned then there exists a set K ⊂ D ∩ A such that [K] is strongly
connected and D(cid:0)[K](cid:1) = D, by Lemma 3.11.

We will use Lemma 3.13 in Section 5 to deduce a non-trivial bound on the proba-
bility that a very small droplet is internally spanned, and hence prove the base case
in our application of the method of iterated hierarchies.

(cid:3)

Our next lemma implies that critical droplets exist, and is based on a fundamental
observation of Aizenman and Lebowitz [1], which has become a standard tool in the
study of bootstrap percolation. In order to obtain a sharp threshold for the Duarte
model, we will need the following, slightly stronger variant of their result.

Lemma 3.14. If [A] = Z2
spanned droplets such that

n, then there exists a pair (D1, D2) of disjointly internally

Proof. Run the spanning algorithm, starting with S = A, until the ﬁrst time t at
which there exists a set K ∈ Kt that spans a droplet D(K) of height larger than
(1− ε)p−1 log 1/p. Since K was created in step t, it follows that K = K1 ∪ K2, where
K1, K2 ∈ Kt−1 are disjoint subsets of A such that [K1] and [K2] are both strongly
connected. Setting D1 = D(cid:0)[K1](cid:1) and D2 = D(cid:0)[K2](cid:1), we have
and h(cid:0)D(K)(cid:1) >

max(cid:8)h(D1), h(D2)(cid:9) 6

by our choice of t, and D1 and D2 are disjointly internally spanned by K1 and K2,
respectively. By Lemma 3.12, it follows that

as required.

(cid:3)

We will also need the following variant of Lemma 3.14, which is closer to the
original lemma of Aizenman and Lebowitz. Since the proof is so similar to that of
Lemma 3.14, it is omitted.

Lemma 3.15. Let D be an internally spanned droplet. Then for any 1 6 k 6 h(D),
there exists an internally spanned droplet D′ ⊂ D such that k 6 h(D′) 6 2k.
3.3. Hierarchies. In this section we will recall the deﬁnition and some basic prop-
erties of hierarchies, which were introduced in [17] and subsequently used and de-
veloped by many authors, for example in [3–5,12,13,16]. We will be quite brief, and
refer the reader to [5] for more details.

Deﬁnition 3.16. Let D be a droplet. A hierarchy H for D is an ordered pair H =
(GH, DH), where GH is a directed rooted tree such that all of its edges are directed
away from the root vroot, and DH : V (GH) → P(Z2) is a function that assigns to
each vertex of GH a droplet, such that the following conditions are satisﬁed:

(1) the root vertex corresponds to D, so DH(vroot) = D;
(2) each vertex has out-degree at most 2;
(3) if v ∈ N →
GH(u) then DH(v) ⊂ DH(u);
(4) if N →

GH(u) = {v, w} then DH(u) ∈ hDH(v) ∪ DH(w)i.

Condition (4) is equivalent to the statement that DH(v) ∪ DH(w) is strongly
connected and that DH(u) is the smallest droplet containing their union. We usually
abbreviate DH(u) to Du.
Deﬁnition 3.17. Let t > 0. A hierarchy H for a droplet D is t-good if it satisﬁes
the following conditions for each u ∈ V (GH):

GH(u) = {v} and |N →

(5) u is a leaf if and only if t 6 h(Du) 6 2t;
(6) if N →
GH(v)| = 1 then
t 6 h(Du) − h(Dv) 6 2t;
GH(v)| 6= 1 then h(Du) − h(Dv) 6 2t;

GH(u) = {v} and |N →
GH(u) = {v, w} then h(Du) − h(Dv) > t.

(7) if N →
(8) if N →

The ﬁnal two conditions, which we deﬁne next, ensure that a good hierarchy for
an internally spanned droplet D accurately represents the growth of the initial sites
D ∩ A. Given nested droplets D ⊂ D′, we deﬁne

∆(D, D′) := (cid:8)D′ ∈ hD ∪ (D′ ∩ A)i(cid:9).

Deﬁnition 3.18. A hierarchy H for D is satisﬁed by A if the following events all
occur disjointly:

(9) if v is a leaf then Dv is internally spanned by A;
(10) if N →

GH(u) = {v} then ∆(Dv, Du) occurs.

THE SHARP THRESHOLD FOR THE DUARTE MODEL

19

Let us also make an easy observation about the event ∆(D, D′), which will be

useful in the next section.
Observation 3.19. Let D ⊂ D1 ⊂ D′ be droplets. Then ∆(D, D′) implies ∆(D1, D′).
Next we recall some standard properties of hierarchies. Our ﬁrst lemma motivates
the deﬁnitions above by showing that every internally spanned droplet has at least
one good and satisﬁed hierarchy. The proof is almost identical to Lemma 8.8 of [5]
(see also Propositions 31 and 33 of [17]), and so we omit it.

Lemma 3.20. Let t > 0, and let D be a droplet with h(D) > t that is internally
spanned by A. Then there exists a t-good and satisﬁed hierarchy for D.
(cid:3)

The next lemma allows us to bound Pp(cid:0)I ×(D)(cid:1) in terms of the good and satisﬁed
hierarchies of D. Let us write HD(t) for the set of all t-good hierarchies for D, and
L(H) for the set of leaves of GH. We write Qu→v for the product over all pairs
{u, v} ⊂ V (GH) such that N →
Lemma 3.21. Let t > 0, and let D be a droplet. Then

GH(u) = {v}.

Pp(cid:0)I ×(D)(cid:1) 6 XH∈HD(t)(cid:18) Yu∈L(H)

Pp(cid:0)I ×(Du)(cid:1)(cid:19)(cid:18)Yu→v

Pp(cid:0)∆(Dv, Du)(cid:1)(cid:19).

Proof of Lemma 3.21. Since the events I ×(Du) for u ∈ L(H) and ∆(Dv, Du) for
u → v are increasing and occur disjointly, this is an immediate consequence of
Lemma 3.20 and the van den Berg–Kesten inequality.

(cid:3)

The following is little more than an observation, but we record it here for com-

pleteness.

Lemma 3.22. Let H ∈ HD(t). Then

Xu∈L(H)

h(Du) +Xu→v(cid:0)h(Du) − h(Dv)(cid:1) > h(D) − v(H).

(11)

Proof. Each vertex of out-degree 2 in GH contributes an additive ‘error’ of 1 to the
diﬀerence between h(D) and the left-hand side of (11), because of the application of
Lemma 3.13. Vertices of out-degree 1 in GH do not contribute any error. Thus (11)
holds (and one could in fact replace v(H) on the right-hand side of (11) with the
number of vertices in GH of out-degree 2).

(cid:3)

If H ∈ HD(t) is a hierarchy and v ∈ L(H), then we say that Dv is a seed of H.

We ﬁnish the section with the following easy lemma, cf. [5, Lemma 8.11].

t-good hierarchies for D that have exactly ℓ seeds. Moreover, if H is a t-good hier-
archy for D with ℓ seeds, then

(cid:12)(cid:12)V (H)(cid:12)(cid:12) = O(cid:18)ℓ · h(D)

t

(cid:19).

(13)

Proof. The height of a t-good hierarchy for D is at most 2h(D)/t, so the bound (13)
is straightforward. To count the number of choices of the droplet Du associated with
the vertex u, we use Lemma 3.4. Thus, given integers a and b such that the source
of Du lies in the square (a, a + 1] × (b, b + 1], and given ⌊w(Du)⌋ = w, we have at
most wO(1) choices for Du, by Lemma 3.4. Summing over a, b and w gives at most
p−O(1) choices in total for Du, since there are at most p−O(1) choices for each of a, b
and w by the condition on h(D). The bound (12) now follows.
(cid:3)

4. Crossings

Our aim in this section is to derive bounds on the probabilities of crossing events,
a phrase that we use informally to mean events of the form ∆(D, D′), for droplets
D ⊂ D′. The bounds we obtain will be used both to prove the inductive step
IH(k) ⇒ IH(k − 1), for each k > 1, in Section 5, and the deduction of Proposition 3.8
from IH(0), in Section 6. The culmination of this section is the following lemma.
Recall that εk = ε2 · (3/4)k, where ε > 0 is suﬃciently small.
Lemma 4.1. Let k > 0 and let D ⊂ D′ be droplets such that h(D) > ε−5

if k = 0.

Suppose also that IH(k) holds. Then

Pp(cid:0)∆(D, D′)(cid:1) 6 exp  −(cid:18)1 − 1.1εk

p − ph(D′)(cid:19)(cid:16)h(D′) − h(D)(cid:17)!. (14)
Observe that, while k > 1 and h(D′) ≪ p−1 log 1/p, which will be the case

(cid:19)(cid:18)log

throughout Section 5, the bound (14) says (roughly) that

1

2

Pp(cid:0)∆(D, D′)(cid:1) > p(1−1.1εk)(h(D′)−h(D))/2.

The contribution from −ph(D′) in the exponent in (14) only starts to matter when
k = 0 and the droplet approaches the critical size. However, it then plays a very
important role: it is the reason why the exponents in (6) and (7) diﬀer by a factor
of 2 (see the discussion after Deﬁnition 3.9).

We reiterate at this point that the constant implied by the O(·) notation in the
statement of the lemma is absolute: that is, it does not depend on any other pa-
rameter (in particular, it does not depend on ε or k). (In fact, one could take the
constant to be 10, but we choose not to keep track of this.)

In order to prove Lemma 4.2 we shall examine how growth from D to D′ could
occur. To do this, we shall show inductively that there exists a sequence of nested
droplets D = D0 < · · · < Dm = D′ such that, for each 1 6 i 6 m − 1, either
(Di \ Di−1) ∩ A contains a large constant number of relatively ‘densely spaced’ sites
(an event which we think of, informally, as corresponding to the droplet growing
row-by-row), or it spans a ‘saver’ droplet of at least a large constant size. These
alternatives are deﬁned precisely in Deﬁnition 4.6.

In order to state that deﬁnition, we will need a weaker notion of connectivity
than the strong connectivity used in conjunction with spanning, which will enable
us to say what we meant by ‘relatively densely spaced’ in the previous paragraph.
Very roughly speaking, we say that a small set of sites is ‘weakly connected and
D-rooted’, for some droplet D, if the sites (might) help D to grow vertically ‘faster
than it should’.

Henceforth in this section let us ﬁx k > 0 and let p > 0 (and hence f ′(0)) be

suﬃciently small.

Deﬁnition 4.3.

(a) Deﬁne a relation ≺ on Z2, called the weak relation, as follows.

Given sites x = (a1, b1) and y = (a2, b2), we say that x ≺ y if
|b2 − b1| 6 2.

a2 − a1 > −ε−6

and

8Note that ∂(D1) ⊂ ∂(D2) does not imply ∂(cid:0)D∗(D1)(cid:1) ⊂ ∂(cid:0)D∗(D2)(cid:1), but that ∂(D1) ⊂ ∂(D2)
and D1 ⊂ D2 does.

22

B. BOLLOB ´AS, H. DUMINIL-COPIN, R. MORRIS, AND P.J. SMITH

(b) We say that a ﬁnite set Y ⊂ Z2 is weakly connected if the graph on Y with
edge set (cid:8)xy ∈ Y (2) : x ≺ y or y ≺ x(cid:9) is connected.
(c) Now let D be a droplet, with width w and source (cid:0)a0, b0(cid:1), and let ZD :=
(cid:8)(a, b) ∈ Z2 \ D : a 6 a0 + w(cid:9). A weakly connected set Y ⊂ ZD is D-rooted
if for every y ∈ Y there exist y1, . . . , yj ∈ Y (for some j > 0) and x ∈ D such
that

The site x is called a root for y with respect to D.

x ≺ y1 ≺ y2 ≺ . . . ≺ yj ≺ y.

The following lemma elucidates the key property of the deﬁnition above. The
somewhat verbose statement (in terms of the numbers h1 and h2) is needed because
in the applications we do not want the ﬁnal bound in (16) to depend on |Y |, which
may be much larger than h1 + h2.

Lemma 4.4. Let h1, h2 > 0 and let p > 0 be suﬃciently small. Now let D be a
droplet with width w and source (a0, b0), let Y ⊂ Z2 \ D be a ﬁnite set, and partition
Y into Y (1) ∪ Y (2), where Y (1) := (cid:8)(a, b) ∈ Y : b > b0(cid:9) and Y (2) := Y \ Y (1).
Suppose that for each y ∈ Y there exists a weakly connected and D-rooted set Y ′ ⊂ Y
containing y, such that |Y ′ ∩ Y (i)| 6 hi for i = 1, 2. Then

(16)

h(cid:0)D(D ∪ Y )(cid:1) 6 h(D) + 2h1 + 2h2 + 2.

Proof. Let us in fact set 0 to be the source of D. As in Lemma 3.12, this is per-
missible because we shall not need to assume that the lattice points inside D have
integer coordinates, neither shall we need to assume this about the elements of
Y . Let D∗ := D∗(D), and let D∗
1 be the Duarte region with width w1, where
f (w1) = f (w) + h1 + h2 + 1, and source (w − w1, h0), where h0 := h1 − h2. We claim
that

D∗ ∪ Y ⊂ D∗
1.
Once we have this the lemma will follow, since

(17)

h(D∗

1) = 2f (w1) + 1 = 2f (w) + 2h1 + 2h2 + 3 = h(D∗) + 2h1 + 2h2 + 2.

To show that D∗ ⊂ D∗

1 it is enough to have ∂(D∗) ⊂ D∗

1, by Observation 3.3.
This containment would hold if f (w1) − f (w) > |h0|, since ∂(D∗) is contained in
the same vertical line in R2 as ∂(D∗
1). But this inequality is immediate from the
deﬁnitions of w1 and h0, so D∗ ⊂ D∗
1 holds. The more substantive task is to show
that Y ⊂ D∗
Claim 4.5. If x = (a1, b1) ∈ D∗ and y = (a, b) ∈ R2 \ D∗ are such that

Figure 4. Claim 4.5 asserts that the shaded region is contained in
D∗
1. The essence of the proof is that the vertical distance between the
boundaries of D∗ and D∗
1 is always at least 2h1 + 1, and p (and hence
f ′(0)) can be taken suﬃciently small to beat the O(1) distance the
region extends to the left of x.

Proof of Claim 4.5. This follows essentially from the convexity of f and the fact
that p (and hence f ′(0)) is suﬃciently small. The key is that the top of D∗
1 always
passes at least distance 2h1 + 1 above x.

To spell out the details, ﬁrst let us assume by symmetry that b > 0, and observe

that for each t ∈ [0, w] we have

h0 + f (t − w + w1) − f (t) > h0 + f (w1) − f (w) = 2h1 + 1,

where we used the convexity of f for the inequality. But the left-hand side is the
diﬀerence between the vertical coordinates of the top-most points in D∗
1 and D∗,
intersected with the column with horizontal coordinate t. Thus we are done if a = a1.
If a > a1 then we are also done, since f is increasing. Finally, if a1 − O(1) 6 a < a1
then we are again done, this time since p is suﬃciently small and hence f ′(t) is
suﬃciently small for all t > 0. (cid:3)

To complete the proof of the lemma, recall that we wish to show Y ⊂ D∗

1. Let
y = (a, b) ∈ Y and without loss of generality let us assume y ∈ Y (1). We know by
the condition of the lemma that there exists a weakly connected and D-rooted set
Y ′ ⊂ Y containing y, such that |Y ′ ∩ Y (i)| 6 hi for i = 1, 2. Now take a path of sites

x ≺ y1 ≺ . . . ≺ yj ≺ y,

with j > 0, such that {y1, . . . , yj, y} ⊂ Y ′ ∩ Y (1), and such that either x ∈ D or
b1 ∈ [−2, 0), where x = (a1, b1). To construct such a path, ﬁrst allow the yi to
belong to Y ′, then, starting at y, truncate the path if necessary at the ﬁrst element
having negative vertical coordinate. It follows that j + 1 6 |Y ′ ∩ Y (1)| 6 h1.
If x ∈ D then, by the deﬁnition of ≺, we have b 6 b1 + 2(j + 1) 6 b1 + 2h1 and
a > a1 − O(j) = a1 − O(1). Hence x and y satisfy the conditions of Claim 4.5. On
the other hand, if b1 ∈ [−2, 0) then b 6 2(j + 1) 6 2h1 and a > −O(1). Hence in
this case 0 and y satisfy the conditions of the claim. In either case it follows that
y ∈ D∗
(cid:3)

1, and the proof is complete.

exists a satisﬁed partition of (D, D′).

k . If ∆(D, D′) holds then there

From here until the end of the proof of Lemma 4.7, let us ﬁx droplets D < D′.
Let Y1, . . . , Ys be the collection of maximal weakly connected and D-rooted sets in
(D′ \ D) ∩ A. (These sets are disjoint, since if Yi ∩ Yj 6= ∅ then Yi ∪ Yj is weakly
connected and D-rooted.10) Finally, let

Y := Y1 ∪ · · · ∪ Ys

and

Z := [D ∪ Y ] \ D.

(19)

The ﬁrst preliminary we need in the build up to the proof of Lemma 4.7 is the

following easy observation about elements of Z.

Observation 4.8. Let z = (c, d) ∈ [D ∪ Yi] \ D for some 1 6 i 6 s. Then one of
the following holds, in each case with a 6 c (and a′ 6 c in case (b)):

(a) there exists a site y := (a, d) ∈ Yi;
(b) there exist sites y := (a, d − 1) ∈ Yi and y′ := (a′, d + 1) ∈ Yi;
(c) (c, d − 1) ∈ D and there exists a site y := (a, d + 1) ∈ Yi;
(d) (c, d + 1) ∈ D and there exists a site y := (a, d − 1) ∈ Yi.

Next we need the following lemma, which says that we may obtain D ∪ Z from
D by taking the closures with each of the Yi independently. This will enable us to
control the size of Z. The lemma also says that there is a good separation between
D ∪ Z and the elements of A outside of D ∪ Z.
Lemma 4.9. We have

Z = (cid:0)[D ∪ Y1] ∪ · · · ∪ [D ∪ Ys](cid:1) \ D.

(20)
Moreover, if x ∈ A \ (D ∪ Z) then there does not exist z ∈ D ∪ Z such that z ≺ x.
Proof. To prove (20), we shall show that no site z1 ∈ [D ∪ Y1] \ D is strongly
connected to a site in z2 ∈ [D ∪ Y2] \ D, unless z1 and z2 lie either side (vertically)
of an element of D. This will establish the claim, since it would imply that the set
[D ∪ Y1] ∪ [D ∪ Y2] is closed, and since the ordering of the Yi was arbitrary.
deﬁnition of ≺:

First, we make the following observation, which follows immediately from the

(∗) If y1 = (a1, b1) ∈ Y1 and y2 = (a2, b2) ∈ Y2, then, since neither y1 ≺ y2 nor

y2 ≺ y1 holds, we must have |b1 − b2| > 3.

Since Y1 and Y2 are each weakly connected, it follows (without loss of generality) that
max{b : (a, b) ∈ Y1} 6 min{b : (a, b) ∈ Y2} − 3. Let z1 = (c1, d1) and z2 = (c2, d2),
and suppose ﬁrst that d1 6 max{b : (a, b) ∈ Y1}. Then, since z1 and z2 are strongly
connected, it follows that d2 < min{b : (a, b) ∈ Y2}. Now, by Observation 4.8, it
follows that (c2, d2 − 1) ∈ D and d2 = min{b : (a, b) ∈ Y2} − 1. But since z1 and z2
are strongly connected, this implies that c1 = c2 and d1 = d2 − 2, and hence z1 and

10This is because the elements of a D-rooted set do not all have to have the same root.

26

B. BOLLOB ´AS, H. DUMINIL-COPIN, R. MORRIS, AND P.J. SMITH

z2 lie either side (vertically) of an element of D, as claimed. The proof in the case
d1 > max{b : (a, b) ∈ Y1} is identical.
To see the second part of the lemma, let x ∈ A \ (D ∪ Z), and suppose that z ≺ x
for some z ∈ D ∪ Z. Observe that z cannot be in D, because then x would belong
to one of the Yi. So in fact we have z ∈ Z and we may assume further that x is
not weakly connected to any element of D. By the ﬁrst part of the lemma, we may
also assume that z ∈ [D ∪ Y1] \ D. We shall show that there exists y ∈ Y1 such that
y ≺ x, which would imply that x belongs to Y1, a contradiction.
Let x = (c0, d0) and let z = (c, d), and let y (and possibly also y′) be the sites
obtained from Observation 4.8 applied to z. If option (a) holds then we immediately
have y ≺ x. If option (b) holds then we take y = (a, d + 1) if d0 > d, to obtain
y ≺ x, and we take y′ = (a, d − 1) if d0 < d, to obtain y′ ≺ x. Finally, if option (c)
holds (say), then since (c, d − 1) ∈ D and z ≺ x, we must have d0 > d − 1, and
therefore we have y ≺ x. (Here we have used the assumption that x is not weakly
if z is near to the left-hand end of D, then there
connected to any element of D:
do exist sites in Z2 \ D within horizontal distance ε−6
to the left of z, and having
vertical coordinate 2 less than that of z. However, any such site is weakly connected
to D.) This completes the proof of the second part of the lemma.
(cid:3)

k

We are now ready to prove Lemma 4.7. The basic idea is as follows:

if none of
the sets Yi has size at least γ, then since (by (20)) we can obtain D ∪ Z from D by
taking the closure of D with each of the Yi independently, we can control the size of
each (strongly) connected component of Z. Since Deﬁnition 4.3 ensures that there
is a large region disjoint from A around any maximal weakly connected component,
the event ∆(D, D′) allows us to deduce the existence of a saver droplet suﬃciently
large to penetrate through this region; see Claim 4.11 below.

Proof of Lemma 4.7. The proof is by induction on ⌊h⌋, where h := h(D′) − h(D).
When h 6 5γ there is nothing to prove: we may take m = 1, D0 = D and D1 = D′,
so that P = (D0, D1) trivially satisﬁes Deﬁnition 4.6. Thus we shall assume that
h > 5γ and that the result holds for smaller non-negative values of ⌊h⌋.
Suppose ﬁrst that |Yi| > γ for some i. In this case we will show that there exists a
droplet D < D1 < D′ with 1 6 h(D1) − h(D) 6 2γ + 2 and such that (cid:0)D1 \ D(cid:1) ∩ Yi
contains a weakly connected D-rooted set of size at least γ, as in Deﬁnition 4.6 (1).
In order to deﬁne D1, we will ﬁrst show that there exists a subset W ⊂ Yi with
|W| = γ that satisﬁes the conditions of Lemma 4.4. Indeed, this follows by greedily
adding points of Yi to W one by one (starting from the empty set), maintaining the
property that W is D-rooted. (So a point y ∈ Yi may be added to W if there exists
u ∈ D ∪ W such that u ≺ y.) It is easy to see that for each u ∈ W there exists a
set W ′ ⊂ W with u ∈ W ′ such that W ′ is weakly connected and D-rooted (simply
take the oriented path leading to u). Moreover, since W ′ ⊂ W and |W| = γ, the

THE SHARP THRESHOLD FOR THE DUARTE MODEL

27

conditions of Lemma 4.4 are satisﬁed for some h1, h2 > 0 with h1 + h2 = γ, and thus

h(cid:0)D(D ∪ W )(cid:1) − h(D) 6 2γ + 2.

If h(cid:0)D(D ∪ W )(cid:1)− h(D) > 2γ, then set D1 = D(D ∪ W ); if not, then choose instead
for D1 any droplet such that 2γ 6 h(D1)− h(D) 6 2γ + 1 and D(D∪ W ) < D1 < D′.
In either case, the droplet D1 satisﬁes the conditions of Deﬁnition 4.6 with i = 1 and
D0 = D. We may therefore apply induction to the pair (D1, D′), noting that the
event ∆(D1, D′) occurs by Observation 3.19, and, for the purpose of the induction
on ⌊h⌋, that we have ensured that h(D′) − h(D1) 6 h(D′) − h(D) − 1.
Henceforth we shall assume that |Yi| 6 γ − 1 for each 1 6 i 6 s. Our task is to
show, using Lemma 4.9, that there exists a saver droplet satisfying condition (2) of
Deﬁnition 4.6. In order to ﬁnd the saver droplet, we begin by showing that either
[(D′ \ D) ∩ (A \ Y )] is strongly connected to D ∪ Z, or we can take the whole of D′
to be the saver droplet.

Claim 4.10. Either there exist sites z ∈ D ∪ Z and x ∈(cid:2)(D′ \ D) ∩ (A \ Y )(cid:3) such

that z and x are strongly connected, or we have

Proof of Claim 4.10. Suppose (21) does not hold. Firstly, note that

D′ ∈ (cid:10)(D′ \ D) ∩ (A \ Y )(cid:11).

(21)

(22)

(cid:2)D ∪ (D′ ∩ A)(cid:3) = hD ∪ Y ∪(cid:0)D′ ∩ (A \ Y )(cid:1)i

= h(cid:0)D ∪ Z(cid:1) ∪(cid:2)(D′ \ D) ∩ (A \ Y )(cid:3)i,

since Y ⊂ D′ ∩ A and D ∪ Z = [D ∪ Y ]. Secondly, the event ∆(D, D′) implies that
[D ∪ (D′ ∩ A)] contains a strongly connected set L such that D′ = D(L). However,
we cannot have L ⊂ D ∪ Z, because if we apply Lemma 4.4 to the droplet D and
the set Y , with h1 = h2 = γ, then we obtain

h(cid:0)D(D ∪ Z)(cid:1) = h(cid:0)D(D ∪ Y )(cid:1) 6 h(D) + 4γ + 2 < h(D′),

where we have used the fact that h(D′) − h(D) > 5γ. We also cannot have L ⊂
(cid:2)(D′ \ D) ∩ (A \ Y )(cid:3), because (21) does not hold. Now, if the union of D ∪ Z and
(cid:2)(D′ \ D) ∩ (A \ Y )(cid:3) is not closed, then we are done: this would immediately imply

the existence of sites x and z as in the statement of the claim. If the union of the
two sets is closed, then by (22) we would have

L ⊂ (cid:2)D ∪ (D′ ∩ A)(cid:3) = (cid:0)D ∪ Z(cid:1) ∪(cid:2)(D′ \ D) ∩ (A \ Y )(cid:3).

Hence, since the strongly connected set L is contained in neither D ∪ Z nor (cid:2)(D′ \
D) ∩ (A \ Y )(cid:3), it must intersect both, and therefore these sets must themselves be

strongly connected, as required. (cid:3)

We now have everything we need to ﬁnd the saver droplet.

Moreover, either h(S) > ε−5
element of (D′ \ D) ∩ A.

We will complete the proof of Lemma 4.7 after the proof of Claim 4.11.

Proof of Claim 4.11. To begin, note that if (21) holds then we may take S = D′,
since then h(S) = h(D′) > ε−5
by the assumption of Lemma 4.7. So let us
k
assume (21) does not hold, and that therefore, by Claim 4.10, there exist sites
z ∈ D ∪ Z and x ∈ [(D′ \ D) ∩ (A \ Y )] such that z and x are strongly connected.
Without loss of generality, let us assume that in fact z ∈ [D ∪ Y1], by (20). Let
S ∈ h(D′ \ D) ∩ (A \ Y )i be the droplet spanned by the strongly connected compo-
nent of [(D′ \ D)∩ (A\ Y )] containing x. We will show that S is the desired droplet,
i.e., that it has all of the claimed properties.
First we must show that the dimensions of S satisfy the conditions of (23). We
begin with the height condition. If z ∈ D then S and D are strongly connected, in
which case

h(cid:0)D(D ∪ S)(cid:1) 6 h(D) + h(S) + 1,

by Lemma 3.12. So assume that z ∈ [D ∪ Y1] \ D, and let Dz = D(Cz), where Cz is
the minimal column of (consecutive) sites containing z and strongly connected to D.
By the deﬁnition of the weak relation and the bound |Y1| 6 γ − 1, and since p (and

THE SHARP THRESHOLD FOR THE DUARTE MODEL

29

therefore f ′(0)) is suﬃciently small, it follows that |Cz| 6 2(γ − 1), and therefore
h(cid:0)D(Cz)(cid:1) 6 2(γ − 1). Hence, by Lemma 3.12 we have

h(cid:0)D(D ∪ {z})(cid:1) 6 h(D) + h(cid:0)D(Cz)(cid:1) + 1 6 h(D) + 2γ − 1.

Now, since z and x are strongly connected, it follows again from Lemma 3.12, this
time applied to droplets D(D ∪ {z}) and S, that

h(cid:0)D(D ∪ S)(cid:1) 6 h(cid:0)D(D ∪ {z})(cid:1) + h(S) + 1 6 h(D) + h(S) + 2γ.

k , it follows that the height condition in (23) holds.

Since 2γ 6 ε−3

For the width condition in (23), notice that since x ∈ [S ∩ A] (but x /∈ A), at

least one of the following must hold:

• S ∩ A has non-empty intersection with the row containing x;
• S ∩ A has non-empty intersection with the row immediately above x and the
row immediately below x.

In either case, since x and z are strongly connected, there exists x′ ∈ S ∩ A diﬀering
from z in its vertical coordinate by at most 2. Note moreover that we can choose
x′ to be in the same strongly connected component of [S ∩ A] as x. Now since
x′ ∈ A\ (D ∪ Z), we cannot have z ≺ x′, by Lemma 4.9. Hence, writing x′ = (a1, b1)
and z = (a3, b3), it follows that w(S) > a3 − a1 − 1 > ε−6
k , which implies the claimed
bound on w(S).

Finally, we must show that the rightmost ε−6

k − 1 columns of S all contain an
element of (D′ \ D) ∩ A. But this follows from the fact that x and x′ lie in the same
strongly connected component of [S ∩ A], using the bound a3 − a1 > ε−6

k . (cid:3)

We now ﬁnish the proof of Lemma 4.7. Let S be the (saver) droplet whose
existence is guaranteed by Claim 4.11. Set D1 to be equal to D(D ∪ S), unless
h(cid:0)D(D ∪ S)(cid:1) − h(D) < 2γ, in which case instead set D1 to be any droplet such that
D(D ∪ S) < D1 < D′ and 2γ 6 h(D1) − h(D) 6 2γ + 1 (cf. the second paragraph
of the proof of the lemma). Then we have w(S) > ε−6
k − 1 by Claim 4.11, and
h(S) > h(D1) − h(D) − ε−3
if D1 = D(D ∪ S), also by Claim 4.11. On the other
hand, if D1 is larger than D(D ∪ S) then
h(D1) − h(D) − ε−3

k 6 2γ + 1 − ε−3

k 6 1,

k

and h(S) > 1 by the deﬁnition of the height of a droplet. Thus in either case S
satisﬁes the conditions of Deﬁnition 4.6 (2).

Finally, we note (once again) that ∆(D1, D′) occurs, by Observation 3.19 (using
the fact that S being spanned by (D′ \ D) ∩ A implies S is also spanned by (D1 \
D) ∩ A, since S ⊂ D1 ⊂ D′), and, for the induction on ⌊h⌋, that h(D′) − h(D1) 6
h(D′) − h(D) − 1. Thus, we are done by induction.

(cid:3)

From here, the proof of Lemma 4.2 is no more than a calculation. First, we

establish a bound for the probability of the existence of saver droplets.

i=0 be a satisﬁed partition for (D, D′), where D and D′
Lemma 4.12. Let P = (Di)m
satisfy the conditions of Lemma 4.2. Let w := w(D′), and suppose that IH(k) holds.
Then, for each 1 6 i 6 m − 1, the probability that (Di \ Di−1) ∩ A spans a saver
droplet (that is, a droplet satisfying the conditions of Deﬁnition 4.6 (2)) is at most

wO(1) · p(1−εk)(1−ε2

k)yi/2,

where yi := h(Di) − h(Di−1).
Proof. First we apply Lemma 3.4 to count the number of choices of the saver Si.
Indeed, if the integer parts of the coordinates of the source of Si are ﬁxed, and if
⌊w(Si)⌋ = a, then the lemma implies that there are at most aO(1) distinct choices
for Si. Now, Si is spanned by (Di \ Di−1) ∩ A, and therefore we have the inclusions
Si ⊂ Di ⊂ D′, since Di and D′ are droplets. So the number of choices for the
integer part of the source of Si is at most w2. Hence, the total number of choices
for Si is at most wO(1), independently of h(Si) and yi.
It only remains to show
that the probability a given droplet Si satisﬁes the conditions of a saver droplet in
Deﬁnition 4.6 (2) is at most

(24)
Let Si be a droplet spanned by (Di \ Di−1) ∩ A, such that the width and height

of Si satisfy the conditions in (18), which we recall again here:

p(1−εk)(1−ε2

k)yi/2.

w(Si) > ε−6

k − 1

and

h(Si) > h(Di) − h(Di−1) − ε−3
k .

(25)

Note that it is possible that h(Si) is large: indeed it is possible that it is much larger
than yi = h(Di) − h(Di−1). If that is the case, then we may pass to a sub-droplet
i ⊂ Si as follows: if h(Si) 6 p−(2/3)k /(log 1/p) then we set S′
S′
i := Si; otherwise, by
Lemma 3.15, we may choose a droplet S′
i ⊂ Si spanned by (Di \ Di−1)∩ A such that

In either case we have

h(S′

(26)

(27)

because if S′

For droplets S′
we have ε2

so (24) holds. For smaller saver droplets we need a better bound, because in these
cases the error of ε−3
in the height bound in (25) is signiﬁcant relative to h(Si).11
k
We obtain this by using the ﬁnal condition of a saver droplet in Deﬁnition 4.6 (2):
that if h(Si) < ε−5
k − 1 columns of Si all contain an element

of (Di \ Di−1) ∩ A. The probability that this occurs is at most

(easy) fact that |∂(Si)| 6 h(Si). The bound in (24) now follows, since h(Si) < ε−5
implies yi 6 2ε−5
k .

k
(cid:3)

We can now complete the proof of Lemma 4.2.

Proof of Lemma 4.2. We shall show that the probability that (D, D′) admits a sat-
isﬁed partition is at most the bound claimed in (15); the lemma will then follow
from Lemma 4.7.

Thus, suppose P = (Di)m

i=0 is a satisﬁed partition for (D, D′), and let w := w(D′).
To start, we claim that for each 1 6 i 6 m − 1, the probability that (Di \ Di−1) ∩ A
contains a weakly connected Di−1-rooted set Yi of size γ = ⌊ε−3
k /2⌋, given that
yi := h(Di) − h(Di−1) 6 2γ + 2, is at most
f ′(w)(cid:19)ε−3

· pε−3

k /2,

k /2−1

(28)

where ck depends only on εk. To see this, ﬁrst note that each y ∈ Yi lies within
vertical distance 2γ + 1 of Di−1, because |Yi| = γ and Yi is Di−1-rooted. Then for
each y ∈ Yi, there are at most O(γ)/f ′(w) sites y′ such that y ≺ y′ (here we have
used that f ′ is decreasing). Hence, when searching for elements of Yi greedily, there
are only ck/f ′(w) choices for each new site. Now if p is suﬃciently small then (28)
is at most

w ·(cid:18) p

f ′(w)(cid:19)(1−εk)yi/2

(29)

k + 2 (and εk being suﬃciently small) implies ε−3

since 2γ 6 yi 6 2γ + 2 6 ε−3
(1 − εk)yi/2, and since 2p · cε−3
On the other hand, for each 1 6 i 6 m − 1, the probability that (Di \ Di−1) ∩ A
spans a saver droplet Si (that is, Si satisﬁes the conditions of Deﬁnition 4.6 (2)) is

6 1, because p is suﬃciently small.

(30)

by Lemma 4.12, where as usual yi := h(Di) − h(Di−1).
Next we combine the bound for weakly connected sets from (29) with the bound
for saver droplets from (30). If one deﬁnes for each 1 6 i 6 m − 1 the event Ei to
be that (Di \ Di−1) ∩ A either contains a weakly connected set of size γ or spans a
saver droplet, then the events Ei are independent as i varies, even though the saver
droplet spanned by (Di \ Di−1) ∩ A may not be fully contained in Di \ Di−1. This
is because Ei only depends on the intersection of Di \ Di−1 with A, and the sets
Di \ Di−1 are disjoint for diﬀerent values of i. Moreover, by (29) and (30),

Pp(Ei) 6 wO(1) ·(cid:18) p

In order to bound the probability that there is a satisﬁed partition for (D, D′), we
take the union bound over the choices of m and D1, . . . , Dm−1. By Lemma 3.4,
the number of choices for each Di is wO(1) (cf. the proof of Lemma 4.12), so the
total number of choices for m and D1, . . . , Dm−1 is at most wO(ε3
ky), by (33). Hence,
by (34), the probability there is a satisﬁed partition for (D, D′) is at most

Figure 7. The two cases of the proof of Lemma 4.1. Both ﬁgures
show the inner droplet D and the outer droplet D′. On the left
(Case 1), w(D′) − w(Dh) is large, the intermediate droplet shown
is Dh, and in the proof we bound Pp(cid:0)∆(D, D′)(cid:1) directly by noting
that every column of D′ \ Dh must intersect A. On the right (Case 2),
h(D′) − h(Dv) is large, the intermediate droplet shown is Dv, and in
the proof we bound Pp(cid:0)∆(D, D′)(cid:1) using Lemma 4.2.

The deduction of Lemma 4.1 from Lemma 4.2 proceeds as follows. Given D ⊂ D′,
let Dv be the minimal droplet such that D ⊂ Dv < D′, and let Dh be the maximal
droplet such that D < Dh ⊂ D′. Observe that

∆(D, D′) ⇒ ∆(Dv, D′) ∧ ∆(Dh, D′).

(35)

Now, either h(D′) − h(Dv) is large, in which case we bound the probability of the
event ∆(Dv, D′) using Lemma 4.2, or w(D′) − w(Dh) is large, in which case we
bound the probability of the event ∆(Dh, D′) directly by noting that every column
of D′ \ Dh must intersect A (see Figure 7). We now give the details.
Proof of Lemma 4.1. Suppose that ∆(D, D′) occurs, and let Dv and Dh be as above.
By (35), we have

Pp(cid:0)∆(D, D′)(cid:1) 6 minnPp(cid:0)∆(Dv, D′)(cid:1), Pp(cid:0)∆(Dh, D′)(cid:1)o.

(36)

To prove the lemma, we shall show that at least one term inside the minimum is at
most the right-hand side of (14).

Let

xv := w(Dv) − w(D),

xh := w(Dh) − w(D),

and x := w(D′) − w(D),

and note that xv + xh = x, because w(Dv) − w(D) = w(D′) − w(Dh). Note also
that xv ∈ Z, since D and Dv have the same source. Let y := h(D′) − h(D), so that
we have

probability Pp(cid:0)∆(Dh, D′)(cid:1) of ‘crossing horizontally’ is small: in fact we shall show
The event ∆(Dh, D′) implies that every column of D′ \ Dh is non-empty. If k > 1

then, since xv is an integer, it follows that

Pp(cid:0)∆(Dh, D′)(cid:1) 6 (cid:0)p · h(D′)(cid:1)εkx/50

where for the ﬁrst inequality we have used the fact that |∂(D′)| 6 h(D′), and for the

k > 1). Combining this with (36) and (38) we have

ε log 1/p. Together with (42), this gives us ﬁnally that

5. Small droplets

In this section we will bound the probability that a droplet of height at most
(p log 1/p)−1 is internally spanned. Recall from Deﬁnition 3.9 that, for each k > 0,
we denote the following statement by IH(k):

Let D be a droplet of height at most p−(2/3)k (log 1/p)−1. Then

where εk = ε2 · (3/4)k.

Pp(cid:0)I ×(D)(cid:1) 6 p(1−εk)h(D)/2,

Our aim is to prove that IH(0) holds. This is an immediate consequence of the
following two lemmas.

Lemma 5.1. IH(k) holds for all suﬃciently large k.

Lemma 5.2. Let k > 1. Then IH(k) ⇒ IH(k − 1).

The proof of Lemma 5.1 is easy, so the main task of this section will be to prove

Lemma 5.2. We begin, however, with the more straightforward task.

Proof of Lemma 5.1. Let k ∈ N be suﬃciently large, and let D be a droplet with
h(D) 6 p−(2/3)k (log 1/p)−1. By Lemma 3.13, if D is internally spanned then

|D ∩ A| >

h(D) + 1

Noting that Observation 3.6 implies that the volume of D (rather crudely) satisﬁes

it follows that

|D| 6 (log 1/p)2 · h(D)2,

|D|

Pp(cid:0)I ×(D)(cid:1) 6 (cid:18)
But if k is suﬃciently large so that εk = ε2 · (3/4)k > (2/3)k, then h(D)· (log 1/p)2 6
p−(2/3)k log 1/p ≪ p−εk, and hence this is at most p(1−εk)h(D)/2, as required.

(cid:0)h(D) + 1(cid:1)/2(cid:19)p(h(D)+1)/2 = O(cid:16)h(D) · p(log 1/p)2(cid:17)(h(D)+1)/2

In order to prove Lemma 5.2 we will use the method of hierarchies. In particular,

we will use Lemmas 3.21, 3.23 and 4.1.

In this section and the next, for the clearer display of expressions involving expo-

nentials, we shall use the notation expp(x) := px.

Pp(cid:0)∆(Dv, Du)(cid:1)(cid:19).

Pp(cid:0)I ×(D)(cid:1) 6 XH∈HD(t)(cid:18) Yu∈L(H)
Let H ∈ HD(t), and note ﬁrst that t 6 h(Du) 6 2t = p−(2/3)k /(cid:0)2 log 1/p(cid:1) for
every u ∈ L(H), so by IH(k) we have

To deduce the desired bound from (44), we shall use IH(k) and Lemmas 3.23 and 4.1.

(cid:19) = o(cid:0)h(D)(cid:1),

it follows that

6. Large droplets, and the proof of Theorem 1.1

In this section we shall prove Proposition 3.8, and deduce Theorem 1.1. The spirit
of this section is similar to that of the previous section, in that we are proving an
upper bound on the probability that a droplet is internally spanned assuming that
we already have a corresponding bound for smaller droplets. This time, however,
the larger droplets will be critical droplets and the smaller droplets will be those
which we can bound using IH(0). Another important diﬀerence is that, as we reach
the critical size, we gain an additional factor of 1/2 in the exponent in the bound

for Pp(cid:0)I ×(D)(cid:1). Indeed, as one can see below in Proposition 6.1, the factor of 1/2

decreases to 1/4 linearly in the height of the droplet as the droplet reaches the
critical size.

Given a droplet D, let

h∗(D) :=

p

log 1/p · h(D)

(50)

denote the renormalized height of D. Proposition 3.8 is an immediate consequence
of the following bound.

Proposition 6.1. For every ε > 0, there exists p0(ε) > 0 such that the following
holds. If 0 < p 6 p0(ε) and D is a droplet with h∗(D) 6 1 − ε, then
− ε(cid:19) h(D)!.

and let h∗(H) := p(log 1/p)−1 · h(H) be the renormalized pod height. Let us write
ℓ(H) for (cid:12)(cid:12)L(H)(cid:12)(cid:12), and set

t :=

Finally, we will need a function µ, deﬁned by

µ(H) :=

We will use the following easy algebraic facts in the proof of Lemma 6.2.

(53)
Note that if h∗(H) 6 h∗(D) 6 1 − ε, which will always be the case in this section,
then µ(H) > ε/2. The following bound is a variant of [17, Lemma 38]. We remark
that such ‘pod lemmas’ have since become a standard tool in the area; see e.g. [3,
13, 17, 18]. The proof follows (as usual) by adapting the argument of [17], but since
in our setting there are some slightly subtle complications to deal with, we will give
the details in full.
Lemma 6.2. Let D be a droplet with h∗(D) 6 1 − ε, and let H be a t-good and
satisﬁed hierarchy for D. Then

Observation 6.3. Let a, a′, s, s′, δ ∈ R. If s′ 6 s 6 1 − 2δ, a > a′, and 2δ(1 + a) >
a − a′, then
(cid:18) 2 − a′ − s′
− δ(cid:19) (a − s).
Proof. The condition s′ 6 s 6 1 − 2δ implies that the left-hand side is decreas-
ing in s′, so we may assume that s = s′. Then the claimed inequality is just a
rearrangement of 2δ(1 + a)(a − a′) > (a − a′)2.

Observation 6.4. Let δ, a, a1, a2, s, s1, s2 ∈ R.
s > s1 + s2, and a1a2 > s1s2, then

40

B. BOLLOB ´AS, H. DUMINIL-COPIN, R. MORRIS, AND P.J. SMITH

Proof. The right-hand side is increasing in a and decreasing in s, since a, s 6 1− 2δ,
so we may assume that a = a1 + a2 and s = s1 + s2, in which case the inequality is
equivalent to a1a2 > s1s2.
(cid:3)

Proof of Lemma 6.2. The proof is by induction on m := |V (GH)|. Note that the
inequality holds trivially if h(H) = h(D), since the right-hand side is at least 1, and
that h(H) = h(D) if m = 1. So let m > 2, and suppose that h(H) < h(D) (so that
in fact h(H) = Pu∈L(H) h(Du)), and that the lemma holds for all hierarchies with
at most m − 1 vertices. We shall divide the induction step into two cases according
to whether or not the ﬁrst step of the hierarchy is a reasonably large sideways step.

Case 1: N →

GH(vroot) = {w} and h(D) − h(Dw) > ε−6.

In this case the desired bound follows from Lemma 4.1, IH(0) and the induction
hypothesis on m, using Observation 6.3. To see this, set D′ = Dw and write H′ for
the hierarchy obtained from H by removing the vertex (and droplet) corresponding
to vroot, and adding a new root at w. Then, trivially,

(55)

u,v∈H′

Now, observe that H′ is a t-good and satisﬁed hierarchy for D′. Thus, by the
induction hypothesis on m, we have
Pp(cid:0)∆(Dv, Du)(cid:1) 6 expp(cid:16)(cid:0)µ(H′) − 2ε2(cid:1)(cid:0)h(D′) − h(H′)(cid:1) − ε−6(cid:0)3ℓ(H) − 2(cid:1)(cid:17),
Yu→v
(56)
where we have replaced ℓ(H′) by ℓ(H) since L(H′) = L(H). Now, since IH(0) holds
(by Lemmas 5.1 and 5.2), and we have the bounds ε−6 6 h(D) − h(D′) 6 2t and
h∗(D) 6 1 − ε, we may apply Lemma 4.1 to give

Pp(cid:0)∆(D′, D)(cid:1) 6 expp(cid:18)(1 − 2ε2)(cid:18)1 − h∗(D)

2

(cid:19)(cid:0)h(D) − h(D′)(cid:1)(cid:19).

Combining (56) and (57) with (55), it follows that it is suﬃcient to show

(58)

(cid:0)µ(H′) − 2ε2(cid:1)(cid:0)h(D′) − h(H′)(cid:1) + (1 − 2ε2)(cid:18)1 − h∗(D)

(cid:19)(cid:0)h(D) − h(D′)(cid:1)
> (cid:0)µ(H) − 2ε2(cid:1)(cid:0)h(D) − h(H)(cid:1).

We would like to apply Observation 6.3 with a = h∗(D), a′ = h∗(D′), s = h∗(H),
s′ = h∗(H′), and δ = 2ε2. If the conditions of the observation are satisﬁed, then
we will be done, since on multiplying through by p−1 log 1/p, the conclusion of the
observation (with these parameters) is equivalent to (58). For the conditions, we
have: h∗(D) > h∗(D′) by assumption; h∗(H) > h∗(H′) from the previous inequality

THE SHARP THRESHOLD FOR THE DUARTE MODEL

41

and since L(H) = L(H′); h∗(H) 6 1 − 4ε2 since h∗(H) 6 h∗(D) and h∗(D) 6 1 − ε;
and ﬁnally,

since h∗(D) − h∗(D′) 6 (log 1/p)−2 ≪ 1, by our choice of t. This completes the
proof of the lemma in Case 1.

4ε2(cid:0)1 + h∗(D)(cid:1) > h∗(D) − h∗(D′)

Case 2: N →

GH(vroot) = {w} and h(D) − h(Dw) < ε−6.

By the deﬁnition of a t-good hierarchy, there are two ways that we could have
h(D) − h(D′) < ε−6. One is that w is a split vertex (which is why we have not
considered separately the case in which vroot is a split vertex; see below), and the
other is that w is a leaf. If w is a leaf then (54) trivially holds, since then vroot and
w are the only vertices in H, and the expression inside the exponent in (54) is at
most

so the right-hand side of (54) is greater than 1.

(cid:0)h(D) − h(Dw)(cid:1)/2 − ε−6 < 0,

Thus we may assume that w is a split vertex. (As mentioned above, we have not
considered the case in which vroot is a split vertex. However, this case is covered by
the calculation below, as long as we allow h(D) − h(Dw) to be zero.14) We shall
show that the desired bound follows from the induction hypothesis on m directly,
using Observation 6.4.

Indeed, set D′ = Dw and write H′ for the hierarchy obtained from H by removing
the vertex (and droplet) corresponding to vroot, and adding a new root at w. More-
over, let N →
GH(w) = {v1, v2}, and, for each i ∈ {1, 2}, set Di = Dvi and let Hi be the
part of H′ below and including vi. Note that

for each i ∈ {1, 2}. Moreover, we have
h(H) = Xu∈L(H)

h(Du) > h(H1) + h(H2)

since we assumed h(H) < h(D), and we also have

h(D) 6 h(D′) + ε−6 6 h(D1) + h(D2) + 1 + ε−6

by Lemma 3.12.

14In this case, set w = vroot and H′ = H in the deﬁnitions in the next paragraph.

Next we shall apply Observation 6.4 with a = h∗(D) − (1 + ε−6)p(log 1/p)−1,
s = h∗(H), ai = h∗(Di) and si = h∗(Hi) for i ∈ {1, 2}, and δ = 2ε2. This is
permissible since we have a 6 a1 + a2 by (62), s > s1 + s2 by (61), a1a2 > s1s2
since ai > si for i ∈ {1, 2} by the deﬁnition of h(Hi), and ﬁnally a, s 6 1 − 2δ
since s 6 a + ε2 (say) and a 6 1 − ε by the assumption of the lemma. Applying
Observation 6.4 and multiplying through by p−1 log 1/p gives
(cid:0)µ(H1) − 2ε2(cid:1)(cid:0)h(D1) − h(H1)(cid:1) +(cid:0)µ(H2) − 2ε2(cid:1)(cid:0)h(D2) − h(H2)(cid:1)

(cid:0)µ(H1) − 2ε2(cid:1)(cid:0)h(D1) − h(H1)(cid:1) +(cid:0)µ(H2) − 2ε2(cid:1)(cid:0)h(D2) − h(H2)(cid:1)
since µ(H) 6 1/2 and h∗(D) 6 1.
with (63) we have that the left-hand side of (59) is at most

> (cid:0)µ(H) − 2ε2(cid:1)(cid:0)h(D) − h(H)(cid:1) − 2ε−6,

Returning to the probability we wish to bound, after combining (59) and (60)

After rearranging, the right-hand side is at least

so all together we have

(63)

expp(cid:16)(cid:0)µ(H) − 2ε2(cid:1)(cid:0)h(D) − h(H)(cid:1) − 2ε−6 − ε−6(cid:0)3ℓ(H1) + 3ℓ(H2) − 4(cid:1)(cid:17).

The proof of the lemma is now complete, since ℓ(H) = ℓ(H1) + ℓ(H2), and we can
bound Pp(cid:0)∆(D′, D)(cid:1) trivially by 1, which gives
Pp(cid:0)∆(Dv, Du)(cid:1) 6 expp(cid:16)(cid:0)µ(H) − 2ε2(cid:1)(cid:0)h(D) − h(H)(cid:1) − ε−6(cid:0)3ℓ(H) − 2(cid:1)(cid:17),

as desired.

(cid:3)

We now have all the tools we need in order to prove Proposition 6.1.

Proof of Proposition 6.1. Let D be a droplet such that h∗(D) 6 1 − ε, set t =
(4p log 1/p)−1, and note that we may assume that h(D) > t, since otherwise the
lemma follows immediately from IH(0). Applying Lemma 3.21 to D, we obtain

Pp(cid:0)I ×(D)(cid:1) 6 XH∈HD(t)(cid:18) Yu∈L(H)

Pp(cid:0)I ×(Du)(cid:1)(cid:19)(cid:18)Yu→v

Pp(cid:0)∆(Dv, Du)(cid:1)(cid:19).

(64)

In order to deduce Proposition 6.1 from (64), we shall use IH(0) and Lemmas 3.23
and 6.2.

Let H ∈ HD(t), and note that h(Du) 6 2t = (2p log 1/p)−1 for every u ∈ L(H).

Thus, by IH(0) (which follows from Lemmas 5.1 and 5.2), we have

As in the proof of Lemma 5.2, we split the sum in (64) into two parts, depending
on the number of seeds in H. Thus, let us set

Pp(cid:0)I ×(Du)(cid:1) 6 Xℓ>p−1/2

H(1) = (cid:8)H ∈ HD(t) : ℓ(H) 6 p−1/2(cid:9) and H(2) = HD(t) \ H(1).
As before, bounding the sum over H ∈ H(2) is easy: by Lemma 3.23 and (65) we
have
expp(cid:16)ℓ · t/3 − O(cid:0)ℓ · h(D)/t(cid:1)(cid:17) < e−p−5/4
XH∈H(2) Yu∈L(H)
where the last inequality holds since h(D)/t = O(cid:0)(log 1/p)2(cid:1) and t > p−3/4.
For the sum over H ∈ H(1), we insert the bounds from (65) and (66) into (64) to
XH∈H(1)(cid:18) Yu∈L(H)
2 (cid:19)h(H)− ε−6(cid:0)3ℓ(H)− 2(cid:1)(cid:19).

We are ﬁnally ready to complete the proof of Theorem 1.1.

Proof of Theorem 1.1. The upper bound was proved in Section 2, so ﬁx λ < 1/8,
and set

We will prove that with high probability a p-random subset A ⊂ Z2
percolate.

Indeed, if A percolates then, by Lemma 3.14, there exists a pair (D1, D2) of

disjointly internally spanned droplets such that

and h(D1) + h(D2) >

and d(D1, D2) 6 2. By Lemma 3.4, there are at most n2 · p−O(1) choices for D1 and
D2 satisfying these conditions. Applying Proposition 6.1 to D1 and D2 (which we
may do since h∗(Di) 6 1 − ε for i ∈ {1, 2}), and using the BK inequality, it follows
that

7. Further discussion and open problems

7.1. The modiﬁed Duarte model. The modiﬁed Duarte model is the monotone
cellular automaton whose update family is

D(m) := n(cid:8)(−1, 0), (0,−1)(cid:9),(cid:8)(1, 0), (0,−1)(cid:9)o.

Thus, the modiﬁed Duarte model comprises two of the three rules of the (original)
Duarte model, has the same stable set, and is also critical and unbalanced with
diﬃculty 1. An interesting feature of the modiﬁed Duarte model is its size:
it is
formed of only two update rules, which is the minimum of any critical update family.
The following theorem is the ﬁrst sharp threshold result for a critical two-dimensional
family that is minimal in this sense.

Theorem 7.1.

pc(cid:0)Z2

n,D(m)(cid:1) = (cid:18) 1

4

+ o(1)(cid:19) (log log n)2

log n

The proof of Theorem 7.1 follows that of Theorem 1.1 almost exactly. The only

as n → ∞.
diﬀerences are that the absence of the rule (cid:8)(0,−1), (0, 1)(cid:9) from D(m) means that,

in order for a droplet to grow vertically, there must be an element of A in every
row, rather than just every alternate row. This leads to some small simpliﬁcations
in Section 4 and a gain of a factor of 2 in the exponent in the bound (14) in
Lemma 4.1, and some similarly minor simpliﬁcations in the upper bound.

THE SHARP THRESHOLD FOR THE DUARTE MODEL

45

7.2. Related two-dimensional models. In two dimensions, sharp thresholds are
now known for the 2-neighbour model (and its modiﬁed analogue) [17], so-called
symmetric balanced threshold models15 [13], a single unbalanced non-drift model [12],
and the Duarte model (and its modiﬁed analogue), but remain open in all other
cases. It might be possible that, using a combination of the techniques from [13, 17]
for balanced models, [12] for unbalanced models without drift, and the present paper
for unbalanced models with drift, one could determine the sharp threshold for any
critical family U whose update rules are contained in the axes (i.e. such that for all
X ∈ U and for all (a, b) ∈ X, we have ab = 0). Nevertheless, we expect the following
problem to be hard.

Problem 7.2. Determine the sharp threshold for any critical family whose update
rules are contained in the axes.

7.3. Higher dimensions. The study of monotone cellular automata in higher di-
mensions is notoriously diﬃcult. In Zd for d > 3, the only models for which sharp
thresholds are known are the r-neighbour bootstrap percolation models [3, 4], for
each 2 6 r 6 d. These r-neighbour models aside, even coarse thresholds (that is,
thresholds up to a constant factor) are only known for a certain family of symmetric
three-dimensional threshold models, whose rules are contained in the axes [14].

The analogue of Problem 7.2 in dimensions d > 3 is likely to be out of reach at
present, but it may be possible to make progress if ‘sharp threshold’ is replaced by
‘coarse threshold’. To state the problem formally, we need to say what we mean by
‘critical’ in higher dimensions. The following deﬁnition was recently proposed by
the authors in [5].

Fix an integer d > 2 and let U be a d-dimensional update family (that is, let U
be a ﬁnite collection of ﬁnite subsets of Zd \ {0}). Deﬁne the stable set S = S(U)
analogously to how it is deﬁned in two dimensions:

where

Hd

[Hd

u] = Hd

S := (cid:8)u ∈ Sd−1 :
u(cid:9),
u := (cid:8)x ∈ Zd : hx, ui < 0(cid:9)

is the discrete half-space in Zd with normal u ∈ Sd−1. Let µ : L(Sd−1) → R denote
the Lebesgue measure on the collection of Lebesgue-measurable subsets of Sd−1.

Deﬁnition 7.3. A d-dimensional update family is:

if C ∩ S 6= ∅ for every open hemisphere C ⊂ Sd−1;

(1) subcritical if µ(C ∩ S) > 0 for every hemisphere C ⊂ Sd−1;
(2) critical if there exists a hemisphere C ⊂ Sd−1 such that µ(C ∩ S) = 0 and
(3) supercritical if C ∩ S = ∅ for some open hemisphere C ⊂ Sd−1.
15That is, models formed by the r-element subsets of a centrally symmetric star subset of
Z2 \ {0}, in the cases where such models are critical and balanced. (Here, ‘star’ means that if x is
in the set then the whole of (0, x] ∩ Z2 is in the set.)

Problem 7.4. For each d > 3, determine the coarse threshold for any d-dimensional
critical family whose update rules are contained in the axes.

This question is already likely to be very diﬃcult, so as a ﬁrst step one might
restrict to the case d = 3 or to update rules contained in the set of nearest neighbours
of the origin.
