ABSTRACT

We derive the fraction of substructure in the Galactic halo using a sample of over 10,000 spectroscopically-
conﬁrmed halo giant stars from the LAMOST spectroscopic survey. By observing 100 synthetic models along
each line of sight with the LAMOST selection function in that sky area, we statistically characterize the ex-
pected halo populations. We deﬁne as SHARDS (Stellar Halo Accretion Related Debris Structures) any stars
in > 3σ excesses above the model predictions. We ﬁnd that at least 10% of the Milky Way halo stars from
LAMOST are part of SHARDS. By running our algorithm on smooth halos observed with the LAMOST se-
lection function, we show that the LAMOST data contain excess substructure over all Galactocentric radii
RGC < 40 kpc, beyond what is expected due to statistical ﬂuctuations and incomplete sampling of a smooth
halo. The level of substructure is consistent with the fraction of stars in SHARDS in model halos created en-
tirely from accreted satellites. This work illustrates the potential of vast spectroscopic surveys with high ﬁlling
factors over large sky areas to recreate the merging history of the Milky Way.

1. INTRODUCTION

Though the stellar halo of the Milky Way (MW) contains
only ∼ 1% of the Galaxy’s total stellar mass, long dynam-
ical times in the halo mean that much of the fossil record
of the formation and evolution of our Galaxy is preserved
in dynamical and chemical signatures of halo stellar popu-
lations. In the prevailing Λ-Cold Dark Matter (ΛCDM) cos-
mological paradigm, massive galaxies grow by the agglom-
eration of many smaller sub-galactic fragments, or subhalos,
that contribute their constituent dark matter, stars, and gas to
the larger host galaxy (e.g., White & Rees 1978; White &
Springel 2000). Through detailed analysis of the kinemat-
ics and chemistry of stellar populations in the MW halo, we
can thus assess the relative importance of the monolithic col-
lapse suggested by Eggen et al. (1962) as a possible origin
for the stellar halo, and the stochastic process of accretion as
discussed by, e.g., Searle & Zinn (1978).

Deep, large-area photometric surveys such as the Two Mi-
cron All-Sky Survey (2MASS; Skrutskie et al. 2006) and the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; York et al. 2000) have laid
bare the ubiquitous substructure lurking in the low surface
brightness stellar halo. The numerous substructures that have
been discovered as stellar overdensities include the Sagittar-
ius (Sgr) tidal stream (e.g., Ibata et al. 1994; Majewski et al.
2003; Belokurov et al. 2006; Koposov et al. 2012), the large,
complex overdensity in Virgo (e.g., Vivas et al. 2001; New-

2004; Rocha-Pinto et al. 2004; Martin et al. 2007; Shefﬁeld
et al. 2014; Price-Whelan et al. 2015), and the Orphan Stream
(e.g., Grillmair 2006; Belokurov et al. 2007; Newberg et al.
2010), among others (for a review of currently known struc-
tures, see Grillmair & Carlin 2016).

It is thus becoming clear that not only is much of the outer
Galactic halo made up of accreted debris, but that this is an
ongoing process. Tidal remnants that are visible as number-
density enhancements are only the most recent infall events,
and do not constitute a representative sample of satellite ac-
cretion at all epochs of MW evolution. Fortunately, accre-
tion remnants remain relatively coherent in phase space over
much longer time scales (e.g., Helmi & White 1999), mak-
ing it possible to identify relics of infall events dating back
many Gyr ago (note, however, that debris from the most an-
cient accretion events will have phase-mixed, and become in-
distinguishable from a smooth halo at present day; see, e.g.,
Johnston et al. 2008). In addition, the long-lived low-mass
stars from accreted dwarf galaxies and star clusters retain the
chemical signatures of their parent satellite at the time of their
formation. It is thus possible to recreate a portion of the hier-
archical formation history of the Galaxy by detailed analysis
of the stellar halo, by which one can determine the fraction of
the halo that resides in substructure at present, and use this to
assess the relative contribution of in situ star formation (i.e.,
stars formed from gas residing in the deep potential well of
the MW) and accretion (stars formed in dwarf galaxy or stel-
lar cluster potentials).

Full cosmological models of Milky Way-mass galaxies with
sufﬁcient resolution to include all the relevant physics at all
physical scales are challenging.7 However, with the combi-
nation of cosmologically-motivated models and semi-analytic
techniques, robust predictions have been made to guide our
intuition about the formation of the Galactic halo. Bullock

7 Progress is being made, however; see, e.g., Tissera et al. 2014 and refer-

ences therein.

Carlin et al.

& Johnston (2005, hereafter “BJ05”) created model stellar
halos from a suite of 11 N-body models of satellites from
cosmologically-motivated merger trees, to which stellar pop-
ulations were assigned in a manner that reasonably matches
the properties of MW satellites. Because these halos are gen-
erated purely from accreted satellites, they offer an extreme
case to compare with our MW halo data. Though they are cre-
ated entirely from satellites, these halos contain a smooth pop-
ulation of older debris in the inner halo (inside RGC ∼ 20 kpc),
with more recent, unmixed accretion events predominating in
the outer halo. Analysis of these halos by Johnston et al.
(2008) showed that different types of structures (great cir-
cles, clouds, and mixed remnants) result from different fam-
ilies of satellite orbits. Substructure dominates in the mock
halos at large radii, but is also biased toward cloud-like rem-
nants, which result from disruptions on radial orbits. Johnston
et al. (2008) found that the most recently accreted substruc-
tures should be more metal-rich than the smooth halo (which
consists predominantly of metal-poor, phase-mixed early de-
bris). Finally, these authors concluded that on average ∼ 10%
(ranging from 1 - 50%) of stars should be currently visible
in substructure, with the fraction depending on the epoch of
accretion.

Abadi et al. (2006) used a suite of eight high-resolution
cosmological (N-body+hydrodynamic) simulations of Milky
Way-like galaxies to explore the outer stellar halo. They
found that outside ∼ 20 kpc, ∼ 95% of the stars are accreted;
the in situ stars found outside this radius were kicked up in
merger events. This leads to a “break” in the radial surface
brightness proﬁle (SBP), where there is excess luminosity be-
yond the break radius compared to an extrapolation of the in-
ner SBP. This steepening of the mass proﬁle with radius was
shown to be consistent with the spatial distribution of MW
and M31 outer-halo globular clusters, suggesting that they
also originated in accretion events. Zolotov et al. (2009) used
high-resolution cosmological N-body+SPH simulations of 4
MW-like galaxies to assess the fraction of in situ halo stars.
In the highest-resolution of their simulations, ∼ 20% of the
halo stars were formed in situ, and are currently located within
∼ 20 - 30 kpc of the galaxy center. These in situ stars form
deep in the potential well of the host, and are kicked out via
merger events. Zolotov et al. (2009) found that the fraction
of in situ halo stars is higher (20 - 50%) in the inner halos of
hosts with relatively quiescent recent merger histories com-
pared to those with more recent merger activity.

In addition to the detection and characterization of high
number density, coherent halo substructures resulting from
recent tidal disruption, recreating the merger history of the
Milky Way requires systematic searches for kinematically
cold structures from older accretion events. Schlaufman et al.
(2009) searched for these “Elements of Cold HalO Substruc-
ture (ECHOS)” in 137 individual SDSS lines of sight, each
covering ∼ 7 square degrees on the sky. Based on identi-
ﬁed statistically signiﬁcant radial velocity peaks among inner-
halo main-sequence turnoff (MSTO) stars (at distances of 10-
17.5 kpc from the Sun), these authors estimated that an upper
limit of ∼ 1/3 of the metal-poor MSTO stars in the inner halo
reside in ECHOS. Starkenburg et al. (2009) developed a met-
ric (the 4distance) for quantifying the separation of stars in
4-dimensional position-velocity space. Their application of
the 4distance to the 101 halo giants from the Spaghetti sur-
vey (Morrison et al. 2000) found that 20 stars (∼ 20% of the
sample) are in groups, compared to an expectation of 9 from
a randomized sample. Thus the authors place a lower limit

that more than 10% of halo stars must be in substructure. The
4distance metric was also applied to a sample of ∼ 4000 BHB
stars from SDSS by Xue et al. (2011), who showed that the
observations have signiﬁcantly more 4distance “pairs” than a
smooth halo, but are deﬁcient in substructure when compared
to the pure-accretion halos of Bullock & Johnston (2005).
This is, however, reconciled when comparing only the old
stars from the models; thus, the (old, metal-poor) BHB stars
must only be tracing a small fraction of the predominantly
metal-rich, recent-infall debris. Most recently, the 4distance
metric was also applied to a sample of 4568 SEGUE K giants
by Janesh et al. (2016). By comparing the number of groups
(created via friends-of-friends aggregation of pairs identiﬁed
by the 4distance) to a smooth model halo, this work showed
that ∼ 50% of the halo stars in their sample are identiﬁed with
groups (though with signiﬁcant contamination from false pos-
itives). The fraction of stars in substructure increases with
Galactocentric radius, and is also higher in more metal-rich
populations than in the most metal-poor halo stars. A large
fraction (> 50% beyond Galactocentric radius of 30 kpc) of
the groups are noted by Janesh et al. (2016) to likely be as-
sociated with the Sgr stream. A correlation function statistic
was applied by Cooper et al. (2011) to the SDSS BHB star
sample from Xue et al. (2008) to search for spatial and kine-
matic correlations in the Galactic halo. The number of BHB
stars was found to be deﬁcient at RGC > 30 kpc compared to
the predictions of the Aquarius simulations of MW-like halos,
though signiﬁcant clustering is present in the BHB sample at
these large radii that is consistent with model halo predictions.
Statistical characterization of the fraction of substructure in
the halo need not be limited to spectroscopically-identiﬁed
samples. Bell et al. (2008) used SDSS DR5 photometry of
MSTO stars to ﬁt the density proﬁle of the Galactic halo.
Based on the rms residuals about this ﬁt, this work con-
cluded that > 40% of the halo is in substructure. This frac-
tion increases with distance, nearly doubling from 10-35 kpc,
though much of this rise can be attributed to Sgr and other
known substructures. Bell et al. showed that the measured
rms is consistent with some of the Bullock & Johnston (2005)
models, which lends support to the notion that the MW halo is
largely accreted debris. Helmi et al. (2011) analyzed Aquar-
ius models (with stellar populations from the semi-analytic
method of Cooper et al. 2010), and found that the rms stel-
lar density in halos with no smooth component is much larger
than that observed in SDSS by Bell et al. (2008). Addition of a
10% smooth halo component brings them roughly into agree-
ment, though because the model halos are highly anisotropic,
the vantage point of the observer affects this signiﬁcantly.

In this work, we measure the fraction of substructure among
Galactic halo stars observed by the LAMOST spectroscopic
survey. Our method is similar to the 4distance technique de-
veloped by Starkenburg et al. (2009), but because the LAM-
OST depth is not uniform along different lines of sight, we
choose not to use a global correlation statistic, but instead
identify statistical excesses in separate regions of sky. LAM-
OST will eventually obtain a nearly complete magnitude-
limited sample (at high Galactic latitudes) over a huge con-
tiguous region of the northern sky. Targets for the LAMOST
survey are selected with a smoothly-varying selection func-
tion, making the sample a relatively unbiased data set. The
combination of a vast contiguous sky area and the simple se-
lection function make this a valuable data set for identifying
substructures on a variety of spatial scales. Though the se-
lection function for a given direction is simple, we neverthe-

less must model its effects over the entire survey; to do so,
we compare all of our results in this work to mock obser-
vations in which we apply the LAMOST selection function
to the Galaxia model (Sharma et al. 2011) in each region of
sky. Finally, we compare our results to accretion-derived ha-
los from Bullock & Johnston (2005), again observed with the
LAMOST selection function.

This paper is outlined as follows. In Section 2, we discuss
the LAMOST survey and the selection of Galactic halo stars
for our substructure search. Section 3 outlines our technique
for identifying substructures, which we dub SHARDS (Stellar
Halo Accretion Related Debris Structures). In Section 4 we
compare our results to the Galaxia model of the smooth halo,
and to halos built entirely from disrupted satellites. We ob-
tain estimates for the fraction of halo stars in substructure in
Section 5, and characterize the overall properties of the sub-
structures we have identiﬁed. We conclude in Section 6 with
some context for our results and a discussion of upcoming
work that builds upon these results.

2. AVAILABLE LAMOST DATA SET AND ITS

PROPERTIES

The Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic
Telescope (LAMOST) survey is an ongoing effort being car-
ried out with the ∼ 4-meter effective aperture Guoshoujing
Telescope in northern China (Cui et al. 2012; Zhao et al.
2012). The telescope has 4000 robotically-positioned op-
tical ﬁbers arrayed over a 5◦ diameter focal plane, feeding
16 optical spectrographs that produce spectra with resolution
R ∼ 2000 covering wavelengths ∼ 3800 < λ < 9000 Å. LAM-
OST has completed 3 years of survey operations plus a Pilot
Survey, and has internally released a total of ∼ 5.7 million
spectra to the collaboration, spanning observation times from
Oct. 2011 – May 2015.8 Of these, ∼ 3.1 million are AFGK-
type stars (mostly part of the LEGUE survey of Galactic struc-
ture; Deng et al. 2012) with estimated stellar parameters (Teff,
logg, [Fe/H]; Wu et al. 2014), and all objects have available
radial velocities or redshifts accurate to 5-10 km s- 1 (e.g., Luo
et al. 2015; Xiang et al. 2015). The survey reaches a limit-
ing magnitude of r = 17.8 (where r denotes magnitudes in the
SDSS r-band), with most targets brighter than r ∼ 17; LAM-

the LAMOST DR1-3 sample. Note that the colorbar saturates at 60; some
bins exceed this total.

OST will achieve a nearly magnitude-limited survey to r ∼ 17
over much of the high Galactic latitude northern sky.

To select a sample of Galactic halo giants, we use stellar
distance estimates derived from the LAMOST stellar param-
eters (Carlin et al. 2015). This work showed that, given the
typical uncertainties in stellar parameters given by the LAM-
OST pipeline, distances to most stars can be derived to . 30%
accuracy. Our sample of halo giants is selected from the
LAMOST database with the constraints: 0.0 < (J - K)0 < 2.0,
K0 < 15.5, spectra having S/N > 5 (in either the g or r band),
derived parameters 0 < logg < 3.5, 3800 < Teff < 6500 K,
and |Z| > 5 kpc.9 The color and magnitude cuts exclude stars
with spurious measurements or extreme stellar types (whose
distances are not well-determined). The |Z| criterion ensures
that the stars in our sample are many scale heights beyond the
disk plane (the disk scale height is ∼ 1 kpc; e.g., Robin et al.
1996; Chen et al. 2001; Siegel et al. 2002; Juri´c et al. 2008),
minimizing the contribution of disk stars to our sample. We
are interested in assembly of a sample of well-understood,
ﬁrst-ascent red giant branch (RGB) stars, so the logg and
Teff cuts are intended to remove objects that could be evolved
stars (e.g., RR Lyrae, horizontal-branch, and asymptotic gi-
ant branch stars), while including sufﬁciently warm stars to
retain the most metal-poor “normal” giants. Finally, the S/N
criterion, while generously allowing relatively low S/N spec-
tra into the sample, is still likely removing many legitimate
K-giant stars from our sample; Liu et al. (2014) showed that
K-giants can be reliably identiﬁed from LAMOST spectra
even at low S/N. For the current study, we choose to avoid
including dwarf contamination that is inevitable in the low
S/N K-giant sample, but will include these in future expan-
sions of this work. The distribution of Galactocentric dis-
tances (RGC) for this sample of 10,481 halo RGB stars is
shown in Figure 1, and their density on the sky is shown
in Figure 2. The sample contains stars extending beyond
RGC > 60 kpc in the halo, with a substantial number of stars
between 40 < RGC < 60 kpc. In Figure 2, most of the stars
are at high Galactic latitudes well away from the plane (as en-
forced by our |Z| > 5 kpc cut), with nearly the entire north
Galactic cap region sampled substantially by LAMOST.

9 Throughout this work, we assume the Sun is at X,Y, Z = (- 8, 0, 0) kpc
in a right-handed Galactic coordinate system. Line-of-sight velocities are
converted to a Galactocentric frame (i.e., VGSR) using a circular velocity of
220 km s- 1 and Solar peculiar velocity of (U,V,W ) = (9, 12, 7) km s- 1.

3. STELLAR EXCESS-FINDING TECHNIQUE

We wish to identify substructures that we will refer to as
SHARDS (Stellar Halo Accretion Related Debris Structures).
By this we mean structures that constitute statistical excesses
in velocity-distance space (if we consider localized sky areas,
this is essentially a 4-dimensional phase space consisting of
3-D position and line-of-sight velocity).

Our goal is to assess the fraction of Galactic halo stars ob-
served by LAMOST that are part of substructures. To do so,
we wish to consider not only structures that are clustered spa-
tially on the sky, but also those that clump in velocity and
distance. Accretion relics remain coherent in phase space for
a longer time than they are visible in conﬁguration space, so
using velocity-distance metrics to identify structures should
sample more of the accretion history of the Milky Way than
simply using spatial clustering and/or distance. Furthermore,
the large areal coverage of the LAMOST survey allows us to
probe much larger spatial scales than surveys that are limited
to localized regions of sky.

We initially considered a method similar to that of Schlauf-
man et al. (2009), which treated each SDSS/SEGUE plate in-
dividually. However, because the LAMOST limiting magni-
tude is fairly bright (r ∼ 17.8), our study is limited to giant
stars, of which there are very few on each individual LAM-
OST line of sight (referred to as “plates”). Nevertheless, when
the entire > 3 million-star data set currently available from
LAMOST is considered, we have a sufﬁcient number of gi-
ants to statistically probe the halo. Freeing ourselves of the
constraints of individual plate areas helps us to probe larger
spatial scales than were available in the ECHOS searches, but
the varying selection function from plate to plate must then be
accounted for in our work, as discussed further in Sections 3
and 4 below.

Our method of searching for substructures proceeds as fol-
lows. We divide the sky into 12◦ × 12◦ regions in right ascen-
sion (RA) and declination (Dec), covering the entire north-
ern sky visible to LAMOST (- 10◦ < Dec < 60◦). This scale
was chosen to provide a large statistical sample in each re-
gion, while not being so large that the Galactic stellar popu-
lations vary dramatically across the region. In order to iden-
tify substructure in velocity and distance, we need to know
what the underlying (“smooth”) halo populations (if there are
any) look like. In other words, we wish to assess what struc-
tures exist in excess over what we expect from the smooth
halo distributions. We adopt the Galaxia (Sharma et al. 2011)
model for this purpose. Galaxia generates expected obser-
vational catalogs by sampling from empirically-based den-
sity and velocity prescriptions for Milky Way stellar popula-
tions. In particular, Galaxia uses an oblate power-law halo
density proﬁle (following Robin et al. 2003) with a veloc-
ity ellipsoid of (σr, σθ, σφ) = (141,75,75) km s- 1. Each in-
stance of the model produces a predicted set of observations
given prescribed color/magnitude ranges and a region of sky.
Sampling from the underlying distributions begins with a ran-
dom number seed, which can be changed to generate distinct
model observations in a given sky area. Thus, to sample the
smooth distributions, we choose to run multiple instances of
the Galaxia model initialized with different random number
seeds, and build a set of mock catalogs with which to statisti-
cally compare the LAMOST observations.

We stress that our comparisons throughout this work tell
us how much substructure is present relative to the Galaxia
model predictions for the underlying halo, so that some frac-

tion of any observed discrepancies may be due to deﬁciencies
in the Galactic components encoded in the model.

Finally, we must account for the inhomogeneous way that
the LAMOST survey targets are selected. Plates in the LAM-
OST survey are separated by magnitude ranges into “Very
Bright” (VB; r < 14), “Bright” (B; 14 < r < 16.8), “Medium”
(M; 16.8 < r < 17.8), and “Faint” (F; r > 17.8) plates so that a
variety of observing conditions can be accommodated, while
also limiting the magnitude range included in each plate to en-
sure that sufﬁcient S/N is achieved for a large fraction of stars
in each observation. This means that the magnitude range
probed in a given region of the sky may differ dramatically
from a neighboring region. In such cases, using only the dis-
tance and velocity distributions of observed stars without ac-
counting for the selection function of stars that were targeted
may strongly bias the results. We thus need to “observe” the
mock catalogs using the LAMOST selection function in order
to obtain a valid comparison.

The process of searching for excess stellar substructures

proceeds as follows:

1. Run 100 simulations (each initialized with different
random seeds) for that ﬁeld with Galaxia (including
only thick-disk and halo components, and using the
same constraints that were applied to isolate halo stars
from the LAMOST data; see Section 2).

2. In each simulation, randomly select a star that is within
0.025 mags in KS vs. (J - KS) color-magnitude space
(or, if the nearest star is more than 0.025 mags away,
try 0.05 mags, then if still none, simply select the near-
est) of each LAMOST object in the Galaxia output. In
this way, we “observe” the Galaxia model in the same
way that LAMOST has observed that part of the sky.
This results in a sample consisting of 92% mock halo
stars and 8% thick-disk stars (averaged over all of the
mock observations, and over the entire sky), as tagged
by Galaxia.

3. Bin the simulated observations into 25 km s- 1 by 5 kpc
bins in the VGSR vs. distance plane, then calculate the
average number of stars found in each of these bins over
the 100 simulated observations of that ﬁeld of view. We
take the standard deviation over the 100 mock catalogs
as an error bar on the counts in each bin.

4. Bin the observed LAMOST data in the same way, and
calculate the residual number of stars for each bin, ex-
pressed as a deviation in the sense nσ = (NLAMOST -
Nmodel)/σmodel, where NLAMOST is the number of ob-
served stars in each bin, Nmodel is the average number
predicted by the model, and σmodel is the standard devi-
ation of the model counts over the 100 simulations.

5. Deﬁne an “excess” as a bin that has > 3σ excess of
observed stars. Rather than trying to identify which
stars should be removed as “background” stars, we re-
tain all stars from each bin in which we have identiﬁed
an excess. Because we expect some excesses simply
due to statistical ﬂuctuations (and we are not consider-
ing deﬁcient bins where there are fewer stars than pre-
dicted), this method includes more stars than are actu-
ally present in SHARDs. We explore this effect further
in Section 4.2, and assess the fraction of “smooth halo”
stars that are identiﬁed as “excess” by our method. For

FIG. 3.— Two examples of our search for SHARDS in 12◦ × 12◦ ﬁelds. In each row, the left panel shows the histogram of (Galactocentric) line-of-sight
velocities (VGSR) measured by LAMOST. The dashed line represents the average (with gray regions showing the 2σ deviation) expectation from 100 Galaxia
models in the same sky area, observed with the LAMOST selection function. The middle panels are 2D histograms in VGSR and distance, with the color scale
encoding the average number of stars in each bin from the 100 Galaxia realizations, and black points representing the LAMOST observations. The right panels
color-code the deviation (in number of σ deviations) of LAMOST data from model predictions in each bin. Red-orange colors represent excesses, and blue-
colored bins are where LAMOST has fewer stars than expected. Bins that are outlined with a solid black line in the right-most column contain three or more
stars, while those with a dashed outline have two stars. SHARDS are those bins with > 3σ excesses and ≥ 2 stars. The top row is for Field 74 at (RA, Dec) =
(162.0◦, 20.0◦), and the bottom row is Field 78: (RA, Dec) = (210.0◦, 20.0◦). Field 74 has a prominent structure in velocity and distance due to the Sgr tidal
stream. While no structure is obvious in the VGSR histogram for Field 78, our algorithm identiﬁes substructure in this ﬁeld (bottom right panel).

the analysis in Sections 4 and 5, we subtract the ex-
pected number of background stars to derive the net
number of excess stars in SHARDS.

Figure 3 shows examples of two ﬁelds from our study. The
upper row is ﬁeld 74, centered at (RA, Dec) = (162.0◦,20.0◦),
and the lower row is ﬁeld 78, at (RA, Dec) = (210.0◦,20.0◦).
The left panels in each row show the observed line-of-sight
velocity distribution (in a Galactocentric frame), VGSR, from
LAMOST as a solid black histogram. The dashed line in each
of these panels shows the mean velocity from the 100 Galaxia
model realizations in that ﬁeld, with the 2σ region given by
the gray shaded region (where σ is the standard deviation of
the model counts in each bin). These panels show a stark
difference in the amount of velocity substructure exceeding
the > 2σ level. Field 74 (the upper panel) shows an obvious
excess centered at VGSR ∼ - 100 km s- 1 that exceeds the 2σ
shaded region in four consecutive bins. This ﬁeld also has a
high-velocity peak that exceeds the expected velocity. In con-
trast, ﬁeld 78 (lower panels) has no velocity peaks exceeding
the 2σ region in the VGSR histogram.

We now show that with the addition of distance information
to the clustering search, substructures emerge even in cases
such as ﬁeld 78, which shows no obvious velocity structure
in the lower-left panel of Figure 3. The center panels of both
rows in Figure 3 display 2D histograms with bins of 25 km s- 1
in VGSR and 5 kpc in (heliocentric) distance. The color of each
bin corresponds to the average number of stars in that bin from
the 100 model realizations, and the black points are the LAM-
OST data. Given this binning and the standard deviation, σ,
for each bin, one can simply compare the expected number

count to the observed count from LAMOST. The deviation
from model expectation, nσ = (NLAMOST - Nmodel)/σmodel, is
mapped in the right panels of Figure 3, where the red-orange
colors represent excesses relative to the model, and blue bins
are deﬁcits. Comparing the 2D maps to the velocity his-
tograms, it is clear that the obvious velocity peak in ﬁeld 74
(upper row) is also coherent in distance, as expected for a
tidal debris structure. This feature is most likely related to
the Sagittarius stream, and has velocity and distance consis-
tent with those from the model of Law & Majewski (2010)
and the SDSS observations of Belokurov et al. (2014). Note
also that some features that appear as strong excess bins in
the right-most panels contain only a single star; because the
average occupancy of many bins (given the model convolved
with the LAMOST selection function) is well below one star
for many bins, a single star may be a statistically signiﬁcant
excess. However, for subsequent analysis we require bins to
have two or more stars for consideration as SHARDS.

While ﬁeld 78 (lower panels in Figure 3) shows no obvi-
ous velocity structure in the left-most panel, there are indeed
signiﬁcant excesses in velocity-distance phase space. We de-
ﬁne SHARDS as all bins containing at least two stars and
greater than 3σ excess in position-velocity phase space (i.e.,
bins in the right column of Figure 3 that are above 3σ), and
select all observed stars from these bins (note that in Figure 3,
bins with 3 or more stars are outlined with a thick solid line,
and those with two stars with a dashed outline). In ﬁeld 74,
which has Sagittarius debris obviously contributing signiﬁ-
cant substructure, 68 stars out of a total of 202 halo giants
reside in SHARDS (after subtracting the background contri-
bution in each bin). Field 78, which shows no obvious veloc-

row of Figure 3.

ity structure in the histogram, nevertheless contains 17 stars in
SHARDS out of a total of 263 in the ﬁeld. This illustrates the
value of using additional dimensions of information to seek
substructures.

We divide the sky into 180 regions that are 12◦ × 12◦ in
RA and Dec, spaced 12 degrees apart on the sky (with cen-
ters at Declinations of - 4◦,8◦,20◦,32◦,44◦, and 56◦). Of
these, there are 112 regions that have more than 10 LAM-
OST halo giants, the threshold we applied for inclusion in our
search, with a total of 10,481 stars. Then, we perform the
same search for SHARDS in each of these regions as in the
ﬁelds illustrated above. This yields a total of 1,140 (2,065)
stars in > 3σ (> 2σ) excesses (after subtracting the model-
predicted “expected” number), or ∼ 10.9% (∼ 19.7%) of the
LAMOST halo giants identiﬁed with SHARDS.

3.1. Caveats

The above result should not be directly interpreted as saying
that ∼ 20% of the halo is in substructure. Before we can as-
sess the meaning of the absolute numbers of stars our method
identiﬁes in SHARDS, we must consider the effects of the
LAMOST selection function and the expected “false posi-
tives” that the inhomogeneous selection function would iden-
tify even if sampling a smooth halo. Additionally, we test our
method on halos created entirely from accreted satellites in
cosmologically-motivated simulations to assess the expected
signature of a purely accreted Milky Way halo.

We reiterate that our method identiﬁes excesses above what
is predicted by the smooth halo prescription in Galaxia. Thus,
any interpretation should bear in mind that uncertainty about
the shape, density proﬁle, and velocity distribution of the halo
will cause discrepancies between the model and observations.
However, any one of these effects alone will affect only one
dimension of our 4D search for SHARDS, and thus would
be unlikely to induce clustered excesses. For example, if the
density proﬁle used in Galaxia is too shallow, we would ﬁnd
excess stars in some radial range, but it would be unlikely for

their velocities to also be similar. In addition, our requirement
that each of the SHARDS have more than a single excess star
reduces the likelihood that model inadequacies or small num-
ber samples would contribute to the detected excesses.

Finally, we note that binning in VGSR vs. distance likely bi-
ases our results somewhat. For example, this technique may
not identify SHARDS that are split across bin boundaries, and
thus contain smaller numbers of stars in each separate bin.
However, the binning is valuable in allowing us to calculate
statistics from the 100 model realizations, so we deem the
small biases to be acceptable. In fact, most of the biases one
can imagine in our rather straightforward method are miti-
gated by comparing to models of smooth and purely-accreted
halos in an identical way to our treatment of LAMOST data,
as described below.

An additional important effect is our choice of a ﬁxed 5 kpc
bin width in distance. The typical uncertainties on individual
stellar distances may be as high as ∼ 30% (Carlin et al. 2015),
so that the distance errors are larger than the bin size for dis-
tances & 17 kpc. With a ﬁxed bin size of 5 kpc, the distance
uncertainties will have the effect of scattering stars between
bins, thus spreading the signal of any SHARDS over multi-
ple bins in distance (note that the 25 km s- 1 velocity bins are
larger than the typical velocity error of 5-10 km s- 1, so this is
not an issue in the RV dimension). The net effect of this will
be that some legitimate SHARDS are not identiﬁed as such,
since a bin that should have been an excess will be spread
out over multiple bins, with the number of stars in each bin
being below the threshold for identiﬁcation as a SHARDS.
[Note that this also means that the detected SHARDS may
actually contain more stars than identiﬁed by our technique,
with some members missed because they scattered into ad-
jacent bins.] We have tested the magnitude of this effect by
using our SHARDS algorithm with variable-width bins span-
ning distance ranges of 5-10 kpc, 10-20 kpc, 20-40 kpc, and
40-80 kpc. These larger bins yield similar total numbers of

FIG. 5.— As in Figure 3, but for Galaxia smooth halo models for Field 74: (RA, Dec) = (162.0◦, 20.0◦). Compare to the upper row of Figure 3 and to Figure 4.

LAMOST halo giants in SHARDS as were found with ﬁxed
bins, with 1,057 (1,885) stars, or ∼ 10.1% (∼ 18.0%), in > 3σ
(> 2σ) excesses (after subtracting the model-predicted “ex-
pected” number). We thus conclude that the ﬁxed distance
bin size has not signiﬁcantly biased our results; this will be
explored in more detail in future contributions.
4. MODEL COMPARISONS

To place our observations into context, we ﬁrst examine the
results from running our code on the model halos from Bul-
lock & Johnston (2005, BJ05). These halos are built purely
from accreted satellites generated from cosmologically-based
merger trees and accretion histories. We thus use our mock
observations of these halos as a test case to see what one might
expect to observe if the Galactic halo consists entirely of satel-
lite debris.

Another test we use to place our observations in context is
to generate model halos using only the smooth halo and thick
disk prescriptions in Galaxia, then observe these halos in the
same way that LAMOST samples the sky. This provides a
picture of how many statistical ﬂuctuations and chance group-
ings are detected as SHARDS by our technique in the case of
a smooth halo.

4.1. Comparison to Bullock & Johnston “pure accretion”

halo

Even if the Galactic halo is made up entirely of accreted
satellites, the debris from ancient accretion events may be
phase mixed and thus no longer visible as substructure in
phase space. Given that most of the accreted satellites were
assimilated long ago, the fraction of halo stars that is in ob-
servable substructure will not be 100%. Furthermore, the
fraction that is in substructure at present depends on the spe-
ciﬁc merger history of the Galaxy. To assess what we expect
to see in the case that the Galactic halo is made up wholly
of satellite remnants, we use the model halos from BJ05. In
this work, cosmologically-motivated initial conditions were
used to give the properties of accreted satellites, each of which
was then modeled via N-body simulations. The results of all
of these N-body models for a given host galaxy were com-
piled together to create a simulated stellar halo created from
the simulated, accreted satellites. The satellite properties in
BJ05 match those of known Milky Way dwarfs, and the resul-
tant halos have roughly the same total luminosity as the Milky
Way. In these models, the destroyed satellites that contribute
most of the stellar halo are accreted early (at least ∼ 9 Gyr
ago), and their debris is mostly smoothly distributed and lo-
cated in the inner halo (inside RGC ∼ 10 kpc). Most visible
substructure is seen in the outer (RGC > 20 kpc) halo, where
more recent accretion events deposit their debris.

The 11 simulated halos from BJ05 have been implemented
in Galaxia, so that we can take simulated observations of these
models and then search for SHARDS in them using the same
algorithm we have used for the LAMOST data. For each of
the 11 simulations, we generate a catalog using Galaxia, then
observe this model by selecting the star that is closest to each
star from LAMOST in K0 vs. (J - K)0. This mock observed
catalog is then passed through the routines outlined above to
detect all SHARDS in the BJ05 model (given the LAMOST
selection function). An example of the results for Field 74
from BJ05 models 1 and 8 (note that these two halos were
selected arbitrarily) is given in Figure 4. These mock obser-
vational results can be compared directly with those from the
top row of Figure 3, which shows the LAMOST results for
Field 74. The velocity distribution (left panels of Figure 4) of
the BJ05 halos is clearly broader than the expectations from
Galaxia, with more stars in the wings of the VGSR histograms
and a deﬁcit (relative to the Milky Way halo prediction) near
VGSR ∼ 0 km s- 1. In the middle and right-hand panels of Fig-
ure 4, it becomes clear that most of the high-velocity excess in
the mock halos is nearby, well-mixed debris, rather than dis-
tant distinct substructures. One obvious difference between
these mock halos and the LAMOST observations in Field 74
is the dominance of the coherent Sagittarius debris structure in
the LAMOST data; no such obvious substructures are visible
in the BJ05 models. There is a feature in halo 8 (lower panels)
that stretches from roughly (VGSR, dist) ∼ (250 km s- 1, 25 kpc)
to (VGSR, dist) ∼ (100 km s- 1, 45 kpc), similar to the caustic-
like features expected from some accretion relics (e.g., John-
ston et al. 2008; Sanderson & Helmi 2013). However, in gen-
eral these mock halos show low levels of substructure at all
radii, as might be expected from a melange of accretion de-
bris. Of 202 halo giants in Field 74, there are 13 and 31 stars
identiﬁed in SHARDS in halos 1 and 8 from BJ05, respec-
tively. In the LAMOST observations, this number is 68 of
202; however, ∼ 30 - 35 of these are likely related to the Sgr
stream, so that the total is ∼ 35 of non-Sgr stars in SHARDS
in this ﬁeld. Thus the pure-accretion halo predictions are con-
sistent with the number seen in LAMOST if we exclude Sgr,
but predict fewer stars in SHARDS than observed when Sgr
debris is included. In fact, in only one (halo 7, with 79) of the
ﬁeld 74 regions of the BJ05 halos do we ﬁnd as many stars in
SHARDS as we have observed with LAMOST.

4.2. Comparison to a “smooth” model halo

Given the sparse selection of halo giants from LAMOST, it
is likely that some stars will be identiﬁed as SHARDS simply
due to statistical noise from sampling the smooth halo distri-
bution. In addition to the inhomogeneous subsampling of the

FIG. 6.— Each panel shows the fraction of observed stars, after subtracting the expected number in each bin, in LAMOST DR1-3 that are identiﬁed as SHARDS
in each 5 kpc bin in Galactocentric radius, RGC (solid black histogram). The upper row gives the fraction of all stars identiﬁed as > 3σ excesses in bins having
more than one star, and the bottom panels require 3 or more stars per group. Gray shaded regions are the average and 1σ variation from mock observations of
all 11 of the Bullock & Johnston (2005) halos (left panels), and the average of 10 Galaxia simulations of the smooth halo (right panels). Colored lines in the left
column are the results for each of the 11 model halos; these illustrate the variety of accretion histories present in the models.

halo, uncertainties in the distances (typically about 20-30%,
related mostly to stellar parameter errors; see Carlin et al.
2015) can also shift stars from their true location in the 2D
plane of VGSR vs. distance, making some stars look like out-
liers compared to the expected populations. To quantify these
effects, we generate a model halo using only the smooth pre-
scriptions for the halo and thick disk that are implemented in
Galaxia. By performing mock observations of these halos in
the manner described in Section 4.1, we generate a catalog of
what would be expected in the LAMOST halo-giant sample if
the underlying distributions are smooth.

We run this observed catalog of “smooth halo” stars through
our SHARDS pipeline. Plots of the results for ﬁeld 74 are
shown in Figure 5. The velocity histogram reproduces the
underlying distribution well, with only a handful of bins mak-
ing excursions larger than one sigma. However, our method
does ﬁnd a number of stellar excesses in this ﬁeld. We ﬁnd
that 18 of 202 stars in Field 74 are in SHARDS (compare
to 68 of 202 in LAMOST, or ∼ 35/202 if Sgr is excluded).
We repeat this exercise for 10 different Galaxia smooth halo
models generated with different random seeds. The average
number of stars in SHARDS is 11/202 (ranging from 5-18)
in Field 74, while the average number in the 11 BJ05 halos
in this same ﬁeld is 40/202 (range: 13-79). This gives an
idea of the level of “background” contributed by sampling the
smooth halo with the LAMOST selection function, as well as
the simplistic method of denoting all stars in bins with > 3σ
excesses of two or more stars as SHARDS. The smooth halo
simulation and the BJ05 pure accretion halos predict a range
that helps us to interpret the number of LAMOST halo stars
in SHARDS according to our algorithm.

5. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

5.1. Fraction of halo stars in substructure

One of the main questions we wish to answer is what frac-
tion of stars in the Galactic halo reside in detectable phase-
space substructures. While the determination of an absolute
fraction is beyond the scope of this work, we can assess what
fraction of the LAMOST halo stars is part of substructure, and
compare this to expectations for what a similar survey would
observe from the BJ05 mock halos.

Figure 6 shows the results of our substructure search in the
LAMOST DR1-3 data. Each of the panels in this ﬁgure shows
the fraction of observed stars that are identiﬁed as SHARDS
in each 5 kpc bin in Galactocentric radius. To compute this
fraction, we summed all stars in SHARDS, then subtracted the
expected number of stars in each bin. This fraction thus con-
sists of the number of excess stars in substructures. The upper
row shows the fraction of all stars in bins containing two or
more stars that are identiﬁed as excesses above three sigma,
and the lower panels require groups to have 3 or more stars
for inclusion. All panels show the observed fraction of sub-
structure in LAMOST as a solid black histogram. The panels
on the left show results from all 11 of the BJ05 halos as lines
of different colors, with the average and standard deviation
as a dashed black line and shaded gray region. On the right
side, the dashed lines represent the average of 10 simulations
of the smooth halo, with the gray shaded region encoding 1σ
variation (where σ is the standard deviation) about this mean.
The upper-right panel of Figure 6 compares the LAMOST
observational results (solid black line) to the average of 10
smooth halo realizations (dashed line with 1σ shaded region),
with bins required to have more than a single star in each of
the SHARDS. It is immediately clear that the stochastic sam-
pling of the halo by LAMOST yields some background of
excess stars relative to the Galaxia model predictions, but that
the likelihood of detecting multiple stars in a > 3σ excess

FIG. 7.— Summary of results from Figure 6. In the left panel, the solid histogram represents the fraction of stars in the LAMOST halo-giants sample that are
part of SHARDS having 2 or more stars; the right panel shows SHARDS with 3 or more stars. Error bars represent Poisson uncertainties on the number counts
in each bin. In both panels, the dashed line is the average from the 11 models of Bullock & Johnston (2005), with the magenta hashed region representing the
1σ variation about this mean (this is the same as the gray ﬁlled regions in Fig. 6). The dot-dashed line with cyan hashed region is the result from 10 simulated
smooth halos (as in the right panels of Fig. 6). This smooth halo fraction represents the level of false positives arising due to our SHARDS detection method.
The fraction of LAMOST stars in SHARDS with ≥ 3 stars is roughly 10% at all radii RGC . 40 kpc. Beyond this radius, there are too few stars for the bins to
be meaningful.

in the smooth halo is slim, yielding an average of less than
10% of stars in SHARDS over all radii. Thus, the fact that
the LAMOST substructure fraction (solid line) is larger than
10% over nearly all radii less than 50 kpc signals a signiﬁ-
cant difference between the smooth halo and what we have
observed. This fraction is consistent with the 10% lower limit
on the fraction of Spaghetti survey data that were estimated
by Starkenburg et al. (2009) to be associated with halo sub-
structures.

The upper-left panel of Figure 6 compares SHARDS that
contain multiple (i.e., > 1) LAMOST halo stars to similar
detections in the 11 BJ05 model halos. From this ﬁgure we
conclude that, given the LAMOST selection function and our
SHARDS algorithm, the amount of substructure in the Galac-
tic halo is consistent with model halos built wholly of ac-
creted satellites. Between 15 . RGC . 60 kpc, the fraction of
LAMOST stars in SHARDS follows closely the fraction from
BJ05. Given that there is also an excess above the smooth
halo in this distance range, it is clear that we are seeing a sig-
nal of substructure. The fraction of substructure in the pure-
accretion BJ05 models is found by our method to be as low
as ∼ 10 - 20% at all radii (on average); this arises because
of a combination of the LAMOST selection function and the
fact that debris from the earliest accretion events is mostly
well-mixed at present, and thus is no longer visible as four-
dimensional substructure by our method.

To isolate a sample with little expected contribution from
false positives, the bottom panels of Figure 6 show the frac-
tion of stars in substructure, but including only stars that
are in stellar excesses of 3 or more stars. As expected, the
smooth halo (lower-right panel) has very few detections of
such groups, while there are numerous SHARDS in LAM-
OST that contain ≥ 3 stars out to RGC ∼ 40 kpc (note that
the lack of such stars beyond 40 kpc is likely simply due to
the paucity of observed stars at such distances). The & 10%
fraction of LAMOST stars in substructures with more than 3
stars exceeds the fraction derived from running our algorithm
on the BJ05 models (lower left panel) over radii 20 . RGC .
35 kpc. This may be due to the presence of the Sgr stream
over much of the LAMOST footprint; few of the BJ05 model
halos contain such a massive, late-infalling satellite.

Figure 7 summarizes our conclusions from Figure 6, focus-
ing on the results for SHARDS that contain 2 or more stars
(left panel) and 3 or more stars (right panel), and are thus
securely identiﬁed as substructures with little contamination
from false positives. The solid black line in both panels of
Figure 7 shows the fraction of LAMOST stars that are part of
SHARDS as a function of Galactocentric radius. For compar-
ison, the dot-dashed line shows number of “false positives”
as the average fraction of stars in SHARDS from the 10 simu-
lated smooth halos, with the 1σ variation among models given
by the cyan shaded region. The average of the eleven BJ05
accreted halos is also shown as a dashed line, with the varia-
tion among these mock halos shaded in magenta. The fraction
of stars in substructure in the LAMOST data exceeds that in
the smooth halo at all radii out to at least 40 kpc.
In fact,
the LAMOST results exceed even the purely accreted halos at
radii between 20 . RGC . 35 kpc, and the level of substruc-
ture is consistent at nearly all radii. The fraction of LAMOST
halo stars that reside in SHARDS is consistently about 10%
above the ﬂoor set by the false positives at all radii out to
RGC . 40 kpc. Beyond 40 kpc, there are too few stars in our
LAMOST catalogs to draw strong conclusions.

In Figure 8 we show the background-subtracted group size
of SHARDS from LAMOST (black histogram), the accreted
halos from BJ05 (blue dashed line), and the smooth Galaxia
halos (dot-dashed red histogram). As expected, there are more
large groups (N & 3 stars) in the LAMOST and accreted-halo
results than in the smooth halo (i.e., the “false positives”).
Between 3 < N < 10 stars per group, the fraction of stars in
SHARDS detected in LAMOST exceeds even the fraction ex-
pected in the purely accreted halos. However, there are more
stars in groups with > 10 stars in the BJ05 halos than in LAM-
OST, suggesting that there may be some intrinsic difference
between the clustering scale of SHARDS and those predicted
by models of accretion-derived halos.

We conclude from analysis of Figures 6, 7, and 8 that the
population of halo stars in LAMOST is clearly inconsistent
with being drawn from a smooth halo. Indeed, the fraction
of Milky Way halo stars in substructure is consistent with ha-
los (from BJ05) created entirely from accreted satellites. Our
conservative choice requiring at least 3 stars in each SHARD

radii RGC < 40 kpc.

5.2. Comparison of global properties of SHARDS to

non-SHARDS halo stars

We now compare the properties of stars identiﬁed as part of
SHARDS in the LAMOST halo sample to those that are not
members of SHARDS. Figure 9 shows the metallicity distri-
bution of all stars that are not part of SHARDS as a solid
line; members of SHARDS with 3 or more stars are shown
as the dashed histogram.10 The SHARDS are shifted toward
higher metallicities than the stars that are not in substructure,
with a deﬁcit of stars at [Fe/H]. - 1.6 and an excess in all
bins with [Fe/H]> - 1.1 relative to the stars that are not in
SHARDS. Schlaufman et al. (2011) found a similar trend in
the ECHOS from SDSS; the mean metallicities of ECHOS
are more metal-rich than the average [Fe/H] of MSTO stars
along the same line of sight. The metallicity of debris is corre-
lated with satellite luminosity (Johnston et al. 2008), such that
more luminous satellites are more enriched than their fainter
counterparts. Furthermore, intact dwarf galaxies in the Local
Group exhibit a clear luminosity-metallicity relation (Kirby
et al. 2013), with satellites at [Fe/H]= - 1.0 at luminosities of
L ∼ 108L⊙. Because the substructures that are observed as
SHARDS (or ECHOS) result from relatively recent accretion
events, their bias toward more metal-rich populations suggests
that the late-infalling satellites contributing to the outer Galac-
tic halo have been predominantly luminous dwarfs rather than
metal-poor ultra-faint dwarf spheroidals. Of course, the most
prominent substructure in the halo – the Sgr stream – is an on-
going accretion of a metal-enriched, luminous satellite, which
may contribute many of the metal-rich SHARDS we have de-
tected.11 Indeed, typical metallicities in the Sgr stream range
from about - 1.2 < [Fe/H] < - 0.4 (see summary in Law &

10 Note that this does not represent a true metallicity distribution function
(MDF) of the Galactic halo, because we have not corrected for completeness
or selection effects.

11 As a simple test of the number of Sgr stream stars contributing SHARDS
to our study, we ﬁt polynomials to the trends of distance and velocity with po-
sition from the compilation of Sgr observational data in Figure 6 of Belokurov
et al. (2014). We then selected SHARDS within 15◦ of the Sagittarius plane,

FIG. 9.— Metallicities of stars not in SHARDS (solid black line) compared
to those that are part of SHARDS with 3 or more stars (gray dashed line).
Error bars are Poisson uncertainties on the number counts in each bin. The
stars that are part of substructure are on average more metal-rich than those
that are not readily identiﬁed with substructure, as was also seen by Schlauf-
man et al. (2011) for ECHOS in SDSS. This suggests that the recent accretion
history of the Milky Way has been dominated by luminous satellites.

Majewski 2016), which is similar to the metallicity range of
the excess stars in SHARDS.

There is evidence for two components in the Galactic halo
(the inner and outer halo; Carollo et al. 2007; Carollo et al.
2010; Beers et al. 2012), with a transition at RGC ∼ 20 kpc. In
simulations of Milky Way-like galaxies, Abadi et al. (2006)
showed that a break in the surface brightness proﬁle occurs
naturally at ∼ 20 kpc from the galaxy center, where within
this radius most of the stars are formed in situ, and kicked up
during merger events, and outside 20 kpc, ∼ 95% of stars are
accreted. The accreted stars contribute excess luminosity be-
yond the break relative to an extrapolation of the inner surface
brightness proﬁle. In Figure 10, we compare the radial distri-
bution of the “smooth” component in our LAMOST sample
(stars that are not in SHARDS) to stars that are in SHARDS.
The SHARDS (dashed line) deviate slightly from the “not-
SHARDS” sample (solid histogram) at radii of ∼ 20- 40 kpc,
with the SHARDS more prominent in this range. While we
have no way of distinguishing accreted vs. in situ halo stars,
this break in the relative numbers of SHARDS vs. non-
SHARDS stars suggests that accretion is a more important
contributor to the halo beyond RGC ∼ 20 kpc than within this
radius.

6. CONCLUSIONS

We have presented a technique for the statistical iden-
tiﬁcation of
substructure in the Galactic halo using
spectroscopically-conﬁrmed RGB stars from LAMOST. Our
method relies on comparison to the Galaxia model (Sharma
et al. 2011) along each line of sight, observing the model halos
with the LAMOST selection function to ensure a valid com-
parison. We conservatively estimate that & 10% of the Milky
Way halo stars from LAMOST are part of substructures that
we refer to as SHARDS (Stellar Halo Accretion Related De-
bris Structures). We quantify the signiﬁcance of our substruc-
ture detection by comparing to a smooth-halo model (Galaxia)

within ±30% in distance from the polynomial trend, and less than 25 km s- 1
in velocity from the polynomial ﬁt to the Belokurov et al. data. This results
in 43 SHARDS containing a total of 167 excess stars. This amounts to only
∼ 8% of the stars in SHARDS from our study. However, this is limited to
the portions of the stream within which Belokurov et al. (2014) presented
data, and is thus likely missing some Sgr debris. We defer further detailed
discussion of the Sgr stream as seen by LAMOST to later work.

FIG. 10.— Distribution of Galactocentric distances for stars not

in
SHARDS (solid black line) compared to those that are part of SHARDS hav-
ing 3 or more stars (gray dashed lines). Error bars are Poisson uncertainties
in the number counts in each bin. Between 20 . RGC . 40 kpc, the SHARDS
density proﬁle exceeds that of the underlying (not-SHARDS) sample. This
may signal an increase in the importance of accretion vs. in situ halo stars at
larger radii, as has been seen in simulations by, e.g., Abadi et al. (2006).

and to mock halos consisting entirely of accreted satellites
(from Bullock & Johnston 2005, BJ05). We ﬁnd that the frac-
tion of halo stars in substructure exceeds what is expected
from statistical ﬂuctuations due to incomplete sampling of a
smooth halo over all Galactocentric radii RGC < 40 kpc. Ad-
ditionally, the LAMOST substructure fraction follows closely
the fraction of BJ05 stars that are identiﬁed with SHARDS,
suggesting that the Galactic halo is consistent with a purely
accreted origin.

The SHARDS we have detected are in general more metal-
rich than the halo stars that are not part of substructure.
The radial proﬁle of SHARDS differs from that of the non-
SHARDS population beyond RGC ∼ 20 kpc, suggesting a
break in stellar populations that may be due to a transition
from well-mixed early accretion debris and in situ stars in the
inner halo to late-infall accretion dominated populations in the
outer halo.

In this work, we are interested in the global characteris-
tics of the Galactic halo, but of course many known sub-
structures are likely present in our catalog of SHARDS. A
brief examination shows evidence of the Sgr stream, TriAnd,
and the Virgo overdensity, and there are likely many others
within this data set. We defer discussion of the previously
known structures to later work, where we plan to examine
them in more detail. Likewise, a detailed comparison of the
chemical abundances of SHARDS to those of halo stars that
are not in substructure will come in future work. Currently,
the LAMOST stellar parameters pipeline derives only a bulk
metallicity, [Fe/H], but not detailed abundances such as [α/Fe]
or [C/Fe]. Lee et al. (2015) have shown that quality mea-
surements of these abundances can be readily achieved from
LAMOST spectra, so we expect in the near future to analyze
the abundance signatures of SHARDS, as was done by, e.g.,
Schlaufman et al. (2012) for ECHOS from SDSS. Chemical
abundances may also provide an additional dimension that
can be used to distinguish accretion relics from in situ halo
populations. As the LAMOST survey continues to ﬁll more

contiguous area to more uniform depths, it will be possible
to characterize the level of substructure on different spatial
scales, with which we can explore the luminosity function and
orbit types of infalling satellites that have contributed to the
halo (Johnston et al. 2008).

Our method to identify substructure is similar in many re-
spects to other techniques that have been used (e.g., the 4dis-
tance – Starkenburg et al. 2009; Janesh et al. 2016; ECHOS
– Schlaufman et al. 2009;
two-point correlation function:
Cooper et al. 2011; Xue et al. 2011). Our technique takes ad-
vantage of the large ﬁlling factor of the LAMOST survey on
the sky, and we account for the complicated selection function
of the survey. We conclude that, beyond RGC > 20 kpc, the
fraction of halo giants from LAMOST that are in substructure
is consistent with expectations from stellar halos (Bullock &
Johnston 2005) built entirely from accreted satellites.
