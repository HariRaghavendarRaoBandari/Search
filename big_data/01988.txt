INVARIANT SUBSPACES GENERATED BY A SINGLE

FUNCTION IN THE POLYDISC

BEYAZ BAS¸AK KOCA AND NAZIM SADIK

Abstract. In this study, we partially answer the question left open in Rudin’s
book [6] on the structure of invariant subspaces of the Hardy space H 2(U n) on
the polydisc U n. We completely describe all invariant subspaces generated by
a single function in the polydisc. Then, using our results, we give the unitary
equivalence of this type of invariant subspace and a characterization of outer
functions in H 2(U n).

1. Introduction

In his book [6, p.78], Rudin posed the question: “One may ask for a classiﬁcation
or an explicit description (in some sense) of all invariant subspaces of H 2(U n).” For
n = 1, Beurling showed, in his well-known paper [2], that every invariant subspace
M of the Hardy space H 2(U ) on the unit disc U is of the form M = f H 2(U ) for some
inner function f , i.e., is generated by a single inner function. This type of invariant
subspace is called the Beurling type. For n ≥ 2, the structure of invariant subspaces
of H 2(U n) is much more complicated. It is clear that the subspaces generated by
an inner function are also invariant in H 2(U n). However, it follows from a result of
Jacewicz [3] that there is an invariant subspace of H 2(U 2) that is generated by two
functions and cannot be generated by any single function. In addition, Rudin [6]
also showed that there are invariant subspaces of H 2(U 2) that are not even ﬁnitely
generated. One may ask what additional conditions are required for an invariant
subspace to be generated by a single function? Sadikov [7] described the Beurling
type invariant subspace of H 2(U n) in terms of the classical theorem of Beurling-
Lax-Halmos (see, [5, Corollary 3.26, p.53]) by considering the space H 2(U n) as the
vector-valued analytic functions on the unit disc. Agrawal, Clark, and Douglas
[1] gave a necessary and suﬃcient condition for Beurling type invariant subspaces
in terms of the unitary equivalence of invariant subspaces, while Mandrekar [4]
gave a necessary and suﬃcient condition in terms of the double commutativity
of shifts. More generally, Sarkar, Sasane, and Brett [8] showed that an invariant
subspace of vector-valued Hardy space satisfying the doubly commuting property
has a Beurling-Lax-Halmos representation.

In this study, we consider the following questions:

1) What is the complete characterization of the function f ∈ H ∞(U n) for the

subspace f H 2(U n) of H 2(U n) to be invariant?

2) Is every singly generated invariant subspaces of H 2(U n) Beurling type?

These questions are answered by Theorems (2.2) and (2.3), respectively. Then, we
study some properties of singly invariant subspaces (inclusions and unitary equiv-
alence). Moreover, a characterization of outer functions in H 2(U n) is given as in
the one-variable case.

Before beginning, let us recall some required facts.
Throughout this paper, n is a positive integer, and Cn is the vector space of all
ordered n-tuples z = (z1, . . . , zn) of complex numbers with inner product hz, wi =

P zi ¯wi, norm |z| = hz, zi1/2, and corresponding polydisc

U n = {z ∈ Cn : |zi| < 1,

i = 1, . . . , n},

whose distinguished boundary is the torus

T n = {z ∈ Cn : |zi| = 1,

i = 1, . . . , n}.

If f is in L1(T n), the space of all functions integrable with respect to normalized
Lebesgue measure mn on T n, then its Poisson integral P [f ] is the function

P [f ] = ZT n

P (z, w)f (w)dmn(w), z ∈ U n,

where P (z, w) is the Poisson kernel.

If f is any function in U n and 0 ≤ r < 1, fr will denote the function deﬁned on

T n by fr(w) = f (rw). Then the function f ∗ is deﬁned as

f ∗(w) = lim
r→1

fr(w)

at every w ∈ T n at which this radial limit exists.

The Hardy space on the polydisc H 2(U n) is deﬁned as the class of all holomorphic

functions f in U n for which

||f ||2 = sup

0≤r<1(cid:26)ZT n

|fr|2dmn(cid:27)1/2

< ∞.

It is well known that if f ∈ H 2(U n), then the radial limit

exists for almost all w ∈ T n, and

f ∗(w) = lim
r→1

fr(w)

lim

r→1ZT n

|fr − f ∗|2dmn = 0.

As usual, we also treat H 2(U n) as a closed subspace of L2(T n), the standard
Lebesgue space of square-integrable functions on T n. H ∞(U n) is the space of all
bounded holomorphic functions f in U n; ||f ||∞ = supz∈U n |f (z)| < ∞. An inner
function in U n is a function f ∈ H ∞(U n) with |f ∗| = 1 a.e. on T n. A function
f ∈ H 2(U n) is said to be outer if

log |f (0)| = ZT n

log |f ∗|dmn.

Recall that a subspace M of H 2(U n) is called “invariant” if (a) M is a closed
linear subspace of H 2(U n) and (b) f ∈ M implies zif ∈ M for i = 1, . . . , n; i.e.,
multiplication by the variables z1, . . . , zn maps M into M . The smallest invariant
subspace of H 2(U n) which contains a given f is denoted by M (f ) and M (f ) is
called the subspace generated by f if M (f ) = f H 2(U n).

The following theorem is required in this study.

INVARIANT SUBSPACES IN THE POLYDISC

Theorem 1.1. [6, Theorem 3.5.3, p.55] If ψ is positive, bounded, and lower semi-
continuous on T n, then ψ = |f ∗| a.e., for some f ∈ H ∞(U n).

For further information on Hardy space on the polydisc, see [6].

2. Main Results

It is clear that the subspace ϕH 2(U n) of H 2(U n) with some inner function ϕ
is invariant. It is natural to ask whether there exists any function f that is not
necessarily inner such that f H 2(U n) is invariant. The following theorem describes
the class of all such functions. Before starting, we give the following deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 2.1. A function f ∈ H ∞(U n) with f −1 ∈ L∞(T n) is called a general-
ized inner function.

Here, it is clear that f −1 = 1/f ∗.

Theorem 2.2. Let f ∈ H ∞(U n). The subspace f H 2(U n) of H 2(U n) is invariant
if and only if f is a generalized inner function.

Proof. Let Mf denote the bounded linear operator on H 2(U n) given by Mf (g) = f g
for any g ∈ H 2(U n). Suppose that the subspace f H 2(U n) is invariant. Since
KerMf = {0} and the image of Mf , f H 2(U n) is closed, Mf is bounded below, that
is, there exists a number δ > 0 such that ||Mf g||2 ≥ δ||g||2 for any g ∈ H 2(U n).
Then |f | ≥ δ a.e. on T n. In fact, assume that mn{ξ ∈ T n : |f | < δ} > 0. Then
mn{ξ ∈ T n : |f | < δ0} > 0 for some δ0 ∈ (0, δ). Let us ﬁx such a δ0 and put
E = {ξ ∈ T n : |f (ξ)| < δ0}. We can construct a sequence of continuous functions
{ϕj}j≥1 deﬁned on T n such that 0 < ϕj ≤ 1 and limj→∞ ϕj = χE a.e. on T n,
where χE denotes the characteristic function of E. By Theorem (1.1) for each j
there exists a function gj ∈ H ∞(U n) ⊂ H 2(U n) such that |gj| = ϕj a.e. on T n.
We get

δ2ZT n

|gj|2dmn ≤ ZT n

|f |2|gj|2dmn

for all j. Applying the Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem we have

δ2mn(E) ≤ ZE

|f |2dmn ≤ δ2

0mn(E) < δ2mn(E),

and we get a contradiction. Hence |f | ≥ δ a.e. on T n, i.e., f −1 ∈ L∞(T n).
Conversely, suppose that f −1 ∈ L∞(T n).
It is clear that for the invariance of
f H 2(U n), it is enough to show the closedness of the subspace f H 2(U n). For this,
we show that Mf is bounded below, that means there exists a number c > 0 such
that ||Mf g||2 ≥ c||g||2 for any g ∈ H 2(U n). In fact, for any g ∈ H 2(U n) we obtain

||g||2 = ||f −1f g||2 ≤ ||f −1||∞ · ||f g||2 = ||f −1||∞ · ||Mf g||2,

and the proof is complete.

(cid:3)

Remark that this theorem shows that every singly generated invariant subspaces
of H 2(U n) is generated by a generalized inner function. It is clear that the class of
inner functions is properly contained in the class of generalized inner function. It
is natural to ask whether every singly generated invariant subspaces is generated
by an inner function, i.e., is Beurling type. The following construction leads to an
aﬃrmative answer:

4

KOCA AND SADIK

Theorem 2.3. There exists a generalized inner function f such that f H 2(U n) 6=
IH 2(U n) for any inner function I.
Proof. We can take a function h ∈ C(T n) such that h > 0 everywhere and the
Poisson integral of log h is not pluriharmonic. By Theorem (1.1), there exists a
function f ∈ H ∞(U n) such that |f ∗| = h almost everywhere on T n. Suppose that
f H 2(U n) = IH 2(U n) for some inner function I. Then, f I −1H 2(U n) = H 2(U n),
hence f I −1 is outer by [6, p.74, Theorem 4.4.6]. It follows that the equality
Re log(f I −1) = log |f I −1| = P [log |(f I −1)∗|] = P [log |f ∗|] = P [log h],

is satisﬁed, showing that P [log h] is pluriharmonic, and we get a contradiction, and
the proof is complete.
(cid:3)

Remark 2.4. By the proof of Theorem (2.3), we have the function f ∈ H ∞(U n),
f 6≡ 0 and |f ∗| = h a.e. on T n, where h is continuous on T n. Then, by [6, Theorem
5.4.5, p. 121], f has the same zeros as some inner function u. This means that
f = f1u, f1 is holomorphic in U n, and f1 has no zero in U n. However, since
P [log |f ∗|] = P [log h] is not the real part of any holomorphic function in U n, f can
not be written as the product of an inner function and an outer function by [6,
Exercise 5.5.7 (a), p.130].

Proposition 2.5. Let f1 and f2 be two generalized inner functions. The invariant
subspaces f1H 2(U n) and f2H 2(U n) satisfy the following conditions:

(a) f1H 2(U n) ⊂ f2H 2(U n) if and only if f1f −1

2 ∈ H ∞(U n) with f2f −1

1 ∈

L∞(T n).

(b) f1H 2(U n) = f2H 2(U n) if and only if f1f −1

2 , f2f −1

1 ∈ H ∞(U n).

Proof.

(a) Assume that f1H 2(U n) ⊂ f2H 2(U n). Then, f1 ∈ f2H 2(U n) and
thus f1 = f2g for some g ∈ H 2(U n). Moreover, f1 ∈ H ∞(U n) and f −1
2 ∈
L∞(T n) gives g = f1f −1
1 ∈ L∞(T n),
then g−1 = f −1
1 f2 ∈ L∞(T n). Conversely, if f1 = f2h, where h ∈ H ∞(U n)
with h−1 ∈ L∞(T n), then f1f = f2(hf ) for any f ∈ H 2(U n) and therefore
f1H 2(U n) ⊂ f2H 2(U n).
(b) It is easily seen from (a).

2 ∈ H ∞(U n). On the other hand, if f −1

(cid:3)

Beurling’s theorem also states (in the one-variable case) that f is outer if and only
if f H 2(U ) = H 2(U ). Rudin proved that one part of this theorem holds, if n > 1
([6, Theorem 4.4.6, p.74]: f is outer, if f H 2(U n) = H 2(U n)), but he also showed
in [6, Theorem 4.4.8 (b), p.76] that there exists an outer function f ∈ H 2(U 2) such
that f H 2(U 2) 6= H 2(U 2), which implies that the converse of the theorem fails if
n > 1. The following result gives a class of functions for which Beurling’s theorem
holds for n > 1.

Corollary 2.6. If f is a generalized inner function, then f is outer if and only if
f H 2(U n) = H 2(U n).
Proof. If f H 2(U n) = H 2(U n), then that the function f is outer is obvious by [6,
Theorem 4.4.6, p.74]. Conversely, suppose that f is outer. Then, by [6, p.73],

(2.1)
which implies that f has no zero in U n, hence f −1 is analytic in U n. On the other
hand, multiplying equality (2.1) by (−1), we obtain that the same equality is true

log |f | = P [log |f ∗|]

for f −1, that is, log |f −1| = P [log |(f −1)∗|]. Since (f ∗)−1 ∈ L∞(T n), log |(f −1)∗| ∈
L∞(T n), and then its Poisson integral P [log |(f −1)∗|] is bounded on U n by [6,
Theorem 2.1.3, p.18]. Hence, f −1 is bounded on U n, and f −1 ∈ H ∞(U n). Applying
Proposition (2.5) (b) to f1 = f and f2 = 1, we have f H 2(U n) = H 2(U n).
(cid:3)

Agrawal, Clark, and Douglas [1] studied the question of unitary equivalence of
invariant subspaces of H 2(U n). Two invariant subspaces M1 and M2 are said to
be unitarily equivalent, if there is a unitary operator U : M1 → M2 such that
U (θf ) = θ(U f ), for θ ∈ H ∞(U n) and f ∈ M1. Under the assumption of full
range of an invariant subspace M (for deﬁnition, see [1, p.5]), they showed that all
invariant subspaces N of H 2(U n) unitarily equivalent to M are of the form ϕM
for some inner function ϕ. However, the Beurling type invariant subspaces do not
have full range [1, Remark 3, p.6], and Mandrekar proved unitary equivalence of
this type of invariant subspace in [4, Theorem 4]. In the following theorem, which
covers to Mandrekar’s result, we now consider the unitary equivalence of the singly
generated invariant subspaces.

Theorem 2.7.

(a) Let f1 and f2 be two generalized inner functions. The
invariant subspaces f1H 2(U n) and f2H 2(U n) are unitarily equivalent if
|f1| = |f2| a.e. on T n.

(b) Any invariant subspace M of H 2(U n) unitarily equivalent to a singly gen-

erated invariant subspace is also singly generated.

Proof.

(a) Let |f1| = |f2| a.e. on T n. Taking the multiplication operator
Mψ : f1H 2(U n) → f2H 2(U n), where ψ := f2f −1
-unimodular function, as
a desired unitary operator, we easily obtain unitary equivalence of these
subspaces.

(b) If the invariant subspace M of H 2(U n) unitarily equivalent to f H 2(U n)
for some generalized inner function f , then, by Lemma 1 in [1] there exists
a unimodular function ψ such that M = ψf H 2(U n) and so, the subspace
M is an invariant subspace generated by g := ψf ∈ H ∞(U n) with g−1 ∈
L∞(T n).

(cid:3)

It is well known that every nonzero function f in H 2(U ) has a factorization
f = gh, where g is inner and h is outer. This is no longer true for H 2(U n) for n > 1
[6, Theorem 4.2.2., p.65]. One can naturally asked whether a generalized statement
may hold true, namely, every nonzero function f in H 2(U n) can be written as the
product f = gh, where h is still an outer function, but where g is now a generalized
inner function. According to [6, Theorem 4.1.1, p. 60], there exists an f in H 2(U n),
f 6≡ 0 such that every bounded holomorphic function vanishing on the zero set of f
is equal to 0 identically. Thus, the generalized factorization does not hold for such
f . We do not know whether a generalized factorization holds true for arbitrary
bounded f 6≡ 0 on U n:

Problem: Can every non-zero function f in H ∞(U n) be written as the product

f = gh, where g is a generalized inner function, h is an outer function?
