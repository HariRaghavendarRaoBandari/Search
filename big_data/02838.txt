ABSTRACT
In this article we present an analytical two-components model for pulsar rotational
dynamics. Under the assumption of axial symmetry and of rigid vortices that tread
the entire neutron superﬂuid, we can project the 3D hydrodynamical problem to a
1D cylindrical one. In the presence of entrainment, the superﬂuid rotation is non-
columnar: we circumvent this by using an auxiliary dynamical variable directly related
to the areal density of vortices. The main result is a set of diﬀerential equations that
take consistently into account the non-uniform radial structure of the star, the dynam-
ical eﬀects of entrainment, the diﬀerential rotation of the superﬂuid component and its
coupling to the observable normal crust. These equations represent the mathematical
framework in which to develop more realistic simulations of pulsar glitches. Our treat-
ment also speciﬁes the physical input needed to build the model: an equation of state,
with the related composition of dense matter, and the density-dependent proﬁles of
vortex drag, pinning force per unit length and entrainment coeﬃcient. Even without
solving the equations explicitly, we are able to draw some general quantitative conclu-
sions; in particular, we show that the reservoir of angular momentum, corresponding
to recent realistic values of the input quantities, is enough to reproduce the largest
glitch observed in the Vela pulsar, provided its mass is not too large.

Key words: stars: neutron - pulsars: general

1 INTRODUCTION

The detection of glitch events in many isolated radio pulsars
indicates that a large amount of angular momentum must
be ﬁrst stored and then exchanged between an internal com-
ponent and the rigid observable crust. Thus a neutron star
must be comprised of (at least) two-components, spinning
at slightly diﬀerent velocities, that interact via some type
of mutual friction in order to permit such an accumulation
and exchange of angular momentum. Observations of very
long post glitch relaxations indicate that one of these com-
ponents should be superﬂuid, whereas the spin-up is so fast
that it is still unresolved (less than one minute).

With this in mind, these recurring period instabilities
are usually explained in terms of superﬂuid vortex dynamics
(Anderson et al. 1975), a scenario where pinning of vortex
lines to the crustal lattice freezes part of the angular momen-
tum and glitches are the consequence of a vortex avalanche,
a catastrophic event in which many vortices are suddenly
expelled from the superﬂuid bulk and transfer their angular
momentum to the crust. The nature of the event that trig-

gers an avalanche is still debated: it could be a starquake
(Ruderman 1976; Ruderman et al. 1998), a hydrodynamic
instability (Glampedakis & Andersson 2009) or a manifesta-
tion of a self-organized critical system (Melatos et. al. 2008).
Despite the variety of existing studies, however, glitch theory
lacks consistent macroscopic models whose quantitative out-
put can be compared with observational data: for example
the need to take into account the spherical and non-uniform
structure of the star in order to evaluate the angular momen-
tum reservoir was pointed out only recently in the framework
of the static “snowplow model” (Pizzochero 2011). Since the
pioneering two-components model of Baym et al. (1969), de-
tailed dynamical models have evolved in order to incorpo-
rate in the dynamical equations diﬀerent subtle eﬀects of
multi-ﬂuid hydrodynamics, such as superﬂuid entrainment
(Carter 1989; Comer & Langlois 1994; Chamel 2008). Al-
though the local hydrodynamical equations are well known,
the great majority of studies of glitches have been carried
out in the quite unphysical approximation of a cylindrical,
uniform-density and rigidly rotating star: as pointed out by
Andersson et al. (2012), there has been little progress on
making pulsar glitch models quantitative.

In this work we address the problem of how to construct

a simple but fully consistent model for pulsar glitches. By
consistent we mean that, starting from well stated hypothe-
sis, we provide a coherent prescription of how to implement
all the available microphysical information in our macro-
scopic set of equations. This permits to account for the fact
that radially the star has a non-uniform structure, which
in turn implies that the rotation of the superﬂuid must be
diﬀerential, even in the simplest (and probably unrealistic)
situation of a regular array of straight vortices.

Our study is in the framework of the two-components
model: a charged, rigid p-component is spun down elec-
tromagnetically, while a non-observable n-component com-
prised of superﬂuid neutrons reacts to the spin down via
some type of mutual friction. The hydrodynamical formal-
ization of this multi-ﬂuid problem is nowadays quite clear
and developed (see for example Andersson & Comer (2007)
and Haskell & Melatos (2015) for recent reviews) and lead
to a computationally diﬃcult 3D problem. We can reduce
it to a simpler 1D model, using two important assumptions:
axial symmetry and rigid vortices. The assumption of ax-
ial symmetry around the rotational axis of the pulsar is a
widely used working hypothesis and permits to reduce the
dimensionality of the problem. In this way, however, we loose
the possibility to study the nature of the trigger event, since
probably it is related to some non-trivial eﬀect of the fully
three-dimensional problem. On the other hand, the assump-
tion of rigid vortices implements the collective rigidity of
vortex bundles in coherent motion, as discussed by Ruder-
man & Sutherland (1974). It also allows explicit integration
along the vortex lines, projecting the spherical star onto its
equatorial plane. In this way we rule out a priori turbulent
motion (a possible trigger mechanism): this is a limit of the
model to be kept in mind.

In this paper we develop a dynamical model for super-
ﬂuid diﬀerential rotation with entrainment: this is a new
scenario since in the literature we can only ﬁnd rigid models
with entrainment (as for example Sidery et al. (2010)) or
diﬀerential models without entrainment (as done in Haskell
et al. (2012)). The recent large values found for entrain-
ment in the crust indicate that such a phenomenon cannot
be ignored in the physics of pulsar glitches (Chamel 2012;
Andersson et al. 2012). Thus an important part of our work
is devoted to point out that in the presence of entrainment
the hydrodynamics cannot be columnar, even in the case
of rigid and parallel vortices: because of the strong density
dependence of entrainment, the angular velocity of the n-
component will depend on the coordinate along the axis of
rotation.

In the next section we will describe our working hy-
pothesis and how to handle coherently the entrainment ef-
fect when there are macroscopically long vortices that pass
trough spherical layers of diﬀerent density and composition.
As discussed in Pizzochero (2011), in the absence of a layer
of normal matter between the core and the inner crust, we
expect the normal vortex cores to pass continuously through
the phase transition between the S-wave superﬂuid in the
crust and the P-wave superﬂuid in the core (Zhou et al.
2004); therefore, we take vortices which thread the entire
neutron superﬂuid. We stress that this is only a possibil-
ity and our model can be simply generalized to account for
two diﬀerent superﬂuid components (as long as we keep the
main assumption of axial symmetry and rigid vortices). The

main result of the paper are the two dynamical equations
presented at the beginning of section 3; these are written
in a form that does not depend on the presence of entrain-
ment or by the fact that vortices pass trough the crust-core
interface. In the following two sections, we give a numeri-
cal example of our results, using consistently some of the
microphysical information that can be found in literature
and employing two diﬀerent equations of state to describe
dense matter. This also permit us to give estimates of the
superﬂuid angular momentum reservoir and of the spin-up
timescales as a function of the stellar mass. A concluding
section summarizes the physical relevance of the paper for
future detailed numerical studies of pulsar glitches.

2 DESCRIPTION OF THE

HYDRODYNAMICAL MODEL

In this section we derive the dynamical equations needed to
describe the diﬀerential rotation of a pulsar in the framework
of the two components model with superﬂuid entrainment.
As already discussed in the introduction, in the presence of
entrainment the superﬂuid velocity ﬁeld cannot be colum-
nar, even if boundary eﬀects and turbulence are totally ne-
glected. To overcome this diﬃculty, we will not consider di-
rectly the velocity of the superﬂuid as a dynamical variable,
but rather an auxiliary variable directly associated to the
vortex line density.

2.1 Model assumptions

In the following we describe the set of assumptions, some of
which can be quite easily generalized at a later time, that
are used to construct our model:

(i) The star is spherical, spinning around the z-axis, with
inner-to-outer crust interface at Rd (the radius at which neu-
tron drip starts). In order to simplify the fully 3D hydro-
dynamical problem, we will extensively use the hypothesis
of axial symmetry around the rotation axis of the star, as
shown in Fig 1. To implement this symmetry, the slow-down
of the pulsar is given by an external braking torque with con-
stant direction Text = −Text ˆez that acts on the star, namely
there is no precession.

(ii) We consider only one superﬂuid component (the n-
component) inside the spherical volume of radius Rd. This
superﬂuid component is threaded by rigid vortices parallel
to ˆez (as in Fig 1), each carrying a quantum of circulation
κ = h/(2mn) (with mn the nucleon mass). This should be
the case if the vortex tension is large enough to avoid sig-
niﬁcant bending of vortex lines over macroscopic distances
(Ruderman & Sutherland 1974). In the absence of a normal
matter layer between the core and the inner crust there is
no clear distinction between the crustal superﬂuid and the
superﬂuid in the core and we assume that normal matter
vortex cores pass continuously through the phase transition
between the S-superﬂuid to the P-superﬂuid. This is the sim-
plest possibility and can be eventually generalized at a later
time by considering superﬂuidity only inside a spherical shell
of radii Rc and Rd.

(iii) The rigid crust and the charged component (electron
and proton ﬂuids) are locked into the strong magnetic ﬁeld of

perﬂuid neutron fraction xn(ρ) (that is zero below neutron
drip density), the normal fraction xp(ρ) = 1− xn(ρ), the en-
trainment parameter n(ρ), the pinning force per unit length
fp(ρ) and the drag parameter η(ρ) arising from the dissipa-
tive processes acting on vortex lines

where, for example, a dissipative process can be the “elec-
tron scattering oﬀ vortex cores” (Bildsten & Epstein 1989).
Given an equation of state (EOS) for the stellar matter and
solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov (TOV) equations,
all these proﬁles are easily parametrized as functions of the
spherical radius r.

For the following, it is useful to introduce the following
integrations along a straight line placed at distance x from
the rotation axis:

the neutron star on very short timescales (the p-component).
Using cylindrical coordinates (x, θ, z), the velocity ﬁeld of
the rigid p-component is vp = xΩp ˆeθ, which is related to
the observed pulsar period P = 2πΩ−1
p .

(iv) As usual in the two-ﬂuid approach, the presence of
vortices induces a mutual friction between the n-component
and the p-component, due to the presence of internal dissi-
pative channels that can be modeled as drag forces acting
on vortex lines (Andersson et al. 2006). For each dissipative
process (“d.p.”) occurring at a given density ρ, we need a
corresponding drag parameter ηd.p.(ρ) that gives the inten-
sity of the associated drag force on vortices.

(v) Vortex lines can also pin to the diﬀerent inhomo-
geneities present in the star, thus we need a quantity that
(for diﬀerent densities and pinning mechanisms) tells us to
which extent vortices can get anchored to the normal crust.
We assume that pinning can be modeled by introducing a
“pinning force per unit length (of vortex line)” fp(ρ), which
expresses the strength of the vortex-inhomogeneity interac-
tion, suitably mediated over a mesoscopic region of density
ρ.

Given this set of assumptions, we are far from describing
the real hydrodynamical problem of a spinning neutron star
interior; nonetheless this is a ﬁrst attempt to construct a dif-
ferential model for the rotational dynamics that encodes the
non-uniform structure of the star and the entrainment eﬀect
in a consistent way, being at the same time computationally
easy to implement.

2.2 Some preliminary deﬁnitions

The microphysical input quantities which describe the stel-
lar structure are functions of the density: to study the ro-
tational dynamics of the two components we need the su-

reduces to the moment of inertia of the n-component if there
is no entrainment (n = 0). Since in all the above deﬁnitions
the integrand functions are proportional to xn, the stellar
radius R can be replaced by Rd.

2.3 Conservation of vorticity

To derive the dynamical equations we could start from the
well known equations for multiﬂuid hydrodynamics, as in
Haskell et al. (2012), but here we prefer to present a simple
constructive derivation. The ﬁrst part of the following argu-
ment is not totally new (Alpar et al. 1984), but the eﬀect of
entrainment and of the radial stellar structure have not been
considered previously. Following the variational formalism
originally developed by Carter (1989), because of entrain-
ment the momentum per particle is a linear superposition
of the local kinematic velocities of the two components:
pn(x) = mn [ (1 − n(x)) vn(x) + n(x)vp(x) ] ,

where we adopted the notation for entrainment discussed by
Prix et al. (2002). Now the Feynman relation takes the form
of Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rule:

pn · dl =

h N (γ)

(8)

(cid:90)

γ

xzRRRcdcoreinnercrustcylindrical radiusx=Rx=RdcRotation axis4

Antonelli et al.

where N is the number of vortex lines enclosed by the con-
tour of integration γ and the factor of two accounts for
Cooper pairs. This expression can be made local by intro-
ducing an areal density of vortices nv at any point (x, θ) on
the equatorial plane. This quantity is well deﬁned because of
assumption (ii) and depends only on the cylindrical radius
x thanks to assumption (i). Thus, by taking the circulation
around a ring of radius x, Eq. (8) reads

(cid:90)

(cid:90) x

pn · dl = h π

dy y nv(y) .

(9)

x

0

Translation of the integration contour along the z-axis al-
ways encircles the same number of vortex lines and thus the
above relation implies that the azimuthal component of the
momentum (denoted by pn) is a function of the cylindrical
radius only, namely pn(x) · ˆeθ = pn(x). On the one hand,
it is convenient to introduce an auxiliary, columnar angular
velocity deﬁned by

Ωv(x) =

pn(x)
mn x

.

From Eq. (8) this quantity obeys the usual Feynman rela-
tion:

Ωv(x) =

κ N (x)
2π x2

.

(10)

On the other hand, the angular velocity of the n-component
is non-columnar due to the density dependence of entrain-
ment and is given by

Ωn(x, z) =

κ

1 − n(r)

N (x)

2π x2 − n(r)
1 − n(r)

Ωp .

(11)

Stokes’ theorem applied to Eq. (9) implies that the density of
vortex lines nv is proportional to component of the vorticity
directed along the normal to the equatorial plane

nv(x) =

(∇ × pn) · ˆez

κ mn

=

1
κ

(2Ωv(x) + x∂xΩv(x)) .

(12)

Exchange of angular momentum between the superﬂuid
and the p-component is possible only if we allow for radial
motion of vortices. Let vL = (vx
L, 0) the local mean ve-
locity of vortex lines in the “laboratory” rest frame. The
conservation of the number of intersections of the vortex
lines with the equatorial plane implies the following conti-
nuity equation

L, vθ

∂x(x nv vx

L) = 0 .

Taking the temporal derivative of Eq. (8) and using the
above expressions (in particular the continuity equation),
it is easy to obtain

∂tΩv(x, t) = − (2Ωv(x, t) + x∂xΩv(x, t))

(13)

This is the ﬁrst dynamical equation of the model: once the
radial velocity vx
L(x, t) is given, it expresses the conservation
of the vorticity of the superﬂuid component, in terms of
a ﬁrst order partial diﬀerential equation for the auxiliary
variable Ωv(x, t).

2.4 Total angular momentum balance

(cid:90)

The isolated pulsar slows down under the action of the ex-
ternal braking torque due to radiation emission, namely

(14)

With the substitution

vn(x, z) = x

Ωv(x) − n(r)Ωp

and using the well known property ρn(r)n(r) = ρp(r)p(r),
after a simple calculation Eq. (14) takes the form

Here we used Eq. (3) and Ip is deﬁned as

Ip =

dr r4 ρp(r)

1 − n(r) − p(r)

1 − n(r)

(16)

and in the absence of entrainment it reduces to the moment
of inertia of the normal component; from equation (15) it is
apparent that Ip is the moment of inertia associated to the
p-component in the presence of entrainment. This quantity
is well deﬁned since the integrand is always positive, thanks
to the physical constraints on the entrainment parameters

n < xp ,

p < 1 − xp = xn ,

valid in any layer of the star (Chamel & Haensel 2006).
Obviously entrainment cannot change the total moment of
inertia of the star

and, since the relation

Ip + Iv = I

holds, we conclude that Iv deﬁned in Eq. (7) is indeed the
correct moment of inertia associated to the auxiliary variable
Ωv.

2.5 Relation between vortex velocity and lag

Equations (13) and (15) provide a close set of partial diﬀer-
ential equations for Ωv and Ωp only after some reasonable
functional dependence of the local velocity vL from the dy-
namical variables Ωv(x) and Ωp is given. We ﬁnd it useful
to introduce a “friction functional” B deﬁned as
L = x B[Ωv, Ωp, x] (Ωv(x) − Ωp) .
vx

(17)
The explicit form of B depends on how vortex dynamics is
modeled; here we refer to a simple but widely used picture,
where a viscous force acts to deviate vortices from corotation
with the bulk superﬂuid and this induces a hydrodynamical
lift force (the Magnus force) on the vortices.

As suggested in Epstein & Baym (1992) a vortex line
experiences a viscous drag force per unit length fD and a
Magnus force fM expressed by

fD = −η(x)(vL(x) − vp(x)) ,
fM = ρn(x)κ × (vL(x) − vn(x)) .

As discussed in Andersson et al. (2006), the presence of en-
trainment does not modify the form of the Magnus force,
providing that the vector κ is given by

κ = κ∇ × pn /|∇ × pn| .

In the present case of straight vortices this vector is obvi-
ously directed along ˆez. Finally, the Kelvin’s circulation the-
orem for ideal and barotropic ﬂuids implies that free vortices
in a background ﬂow are transported with the ﬂuid, thus be-
having like massless particles. Since there is no inertia, the
equation of motion for rigid vortices is given by

(cid:90)

Ftot =

dl(x) [fM (x) + fD(x)] = 0 ,

where the integration is performed over the line, as in Eqs

(19)

where the x-dependence is understood for notational sim-
plicity. Here we have deﬁned the angular velocity lag ω as

ω(x, t) = Ωv(x, t) − Ωp(t) .

(20)
In the absence of entrainment our lag ω reduces to Ωn − Ωp.
Of course if Ωv(x) → Ωp, vortices corotate locally with the
L(x) →
two components and there is no outward motion: vx
L(x) → xΩp. Equations (18) and (19) suggest to
0 and vθ
introduce the dimensionless parameters

Bx(x) =

Bθ(x) =

d(x) b(x)

d(x)2 + a(x)2 ,

a(x) b(x)

d(x)2 + a(x)2 .

(21)

(22)

Comparing Eq. (17) and (21) we see that in the present ap-
proach the friction functional is only dependent on x, namely
B[Ωv, Ωp, x] = Bx(x). In the frame of reference of the crust,
the velocity of vortex lines at radius x makes an angle θd with
the direction ˆeθ (the dissipation angle) such that locally we
have tan(θd) = d(x)/a(x). This generalizes the early result
of Epstein & Baym (1992) in the presence of entrainment
and for a non-uniform star.

2.6 Eﬀective pinning

Vortex pinning to the crustal lattice is the fundamental
mechanism to store the angular momentum needed to pro-
duce a glitch. One possibility to model pinning is to incor-
porate its eﬀect in the general form of the functional B, in
order to reproduce the local mean behavior of vortex lines.
In Eq. (18) the mean outward velocity vx
L is proportional to

c(cid:13) 2016 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–13

Axially symmetric equations for pulsar rotation

5
Bx(x) and pinning can be addressed by saying that only a
fraction Y of (unpinned) vortex lines is free to move under
the action of the drag force. Formally this means that we
are approximating the friction functional as
B[Ωv, Ωp, x] ≈ Y [ω, x] Bx(x) .

(23)

Alternatively, by considering a large population of vortices
around the radius x, we can also interpret Y as the “proba-
bility for unpinning” (Jahan-Miri 2006). To give an estimate
of Y we can use the general scenario of the snowplow mech-
anism described in Pizzochero (2011): when the local lag
ω(x) is greater than a critical lag for unpinning ωcr(x), the
vortices break free and are able to move outward. For clarity
we stress that an important feature of the original snowplow
model is that the particular form of ωcr and the assumption
of rapid expulsion of unpinned vortex lines suggest the for-
mation of a thin sheet of accumulated vorticity that slowly
creeps outward. However, since our model is dynamical, we
don’t need to incorporate this “vortex-sheet” assumption:
here we just need to generalize the prescription for calcu-
lating the snowplow critical proﬁle ωcr when entrainment is
present.

The starting point is the mesoscopic vortex-lattice in-
teraction, namely the average pinning force (per unit length)
acting on a rigid vortex that passes trough many lattice sites.
Donati & Pizzochero (2004, 2006) studied the microscopic
vortex-nucleus interaction, whereas Seveso et al. (2016) pro-
vide the mesoscopic pinning force per unit length in the
crust fP (ρ). The physical meaning of this quantity is that
a segment of vortex line can locally unpin if the modulus of
the forces (leaving out the pinning force) acting on it equals
fP . In the following we present a simple extension of this to
the rigid vortex motion described here, based on a “rigid”
model of the pinning force: a vortex line unpins when the
modulus of the total force acting on it is equal or greater
than the integrated value of fP along the line.

Rigid pinning - When a pinning force per unit length
fP (x) acts on a segment of vortex line at x , the general
equations of motion of rigid vortices become

Ftot =

dl(x) [fM (x) + fD(x) + fP (x)] = 0 .

(cid:90)

L

The vectorial quantity fP (x) is not known, since no reliable
estimate of the dependence of the microscopic pinning force
on the vortex-nucleus separation is available. Note that,
despite our notation, in general fP is not the modulus of
fP : the mesoscopic quantity fP (ρ) studied by Seveso et al.
(2016) represents the threshold for unpinning, namely it is
the maximum value that the pinning force can sustain be-
fore letting the vortex segment free to move (analogous to a
static friction force, which adjust itself to the external force
up to a maximum value where motion sets in). Despite this
diﬃculty, we can use the equation of motion to determine the
critical lag for unpinning; the viscous drag force is such that
|fD|vL=vp = 0, namely it does not act on pinned vortices
co-moving with the crust. Thus we can write the condition
for unpinning in terms of the Magnus force alone, whatever
the actual form of fP is: due to the macroscopic rigidity of
the vortex line, the Magnus force acting on the line (at a
cylindrical radius x) must be greater than

in order to unpin the vortex. It follows that

FP (x) = |FM (x)|vL=vp
(cid:18)

is the magnitude of the total Magnus force acting on a vortex
when the critical velocity lag for unpinning is reached. Since

by using the deﬁnition of lag given in Eq. (20) and the def-
inition of b(x) given in Eq. (3) it is straightforward to ﬁnd
that the critical lag proﬁle is given by

ωcr(x) =

FP (x)
κ x b(x)

.

(24)

With no entrainment (n = 0) this result reduces to the def-
inition of the critical lag proﬁle given in Pizzochero (2011).
The simplest way to encode pinning in our equations is

thus to choose

Y [ω, x] = θ(|ω(x)| − ωcr(x)) .

(25)

When the absolute value of the local lag is smaller than
ωcr(x) the fraction of unpinned vortices is zero and there is
no radial motion of vortex lines; otherwise the vortices con-
tained in a thin cylindrical shell of radius x can move inward
or outward depending on the sign of ω(x). The introduction
of such a non analytical term into the equations poses a
mathematical complication. However we have in mind that
our equations can be used to deﬁne a numerical simulation
of pulsar glitches: discretizing the cylindrical radius in many
cells, Eq. (25) just tells us whether vortices in that cell can
be moved or not.

Vortex-creep - By using Eq. (25) we have the advantage
that there is no need to introduce new parameters into the
model, even though it is an unfortunate choice from the ana-
lytical point of view. We expect that temperature, quantum
eﬀects and ﬁnite vortex tension all take part in smooth-
ing the step-like form of Y , somewhat similarly to the early
vortex-creep model of Alpar et al. (1984) where the radial
velocity is given by
L ≈ 2 v0 e

α(x) ˜ωcr(x)

Here α is a dimensionless temperature that tunes the local
rigidity of the pinning, v0 a typical velocity of the micro-
scopic motion of vortex lines and ˜ωcr(x) is an opportune
critical lag. In the framework of the original work of Alpar
et al. (1984) it is not simple to implement consistently the ge-
ometry of the problem (even with our strong assumption of
rigid vortices) and it is not clear which prescription we have
to use to estimate the cylindrical proﬁles α(x) and ˜ωcr(x).
However, the expression for vx
L of Alpar et al. (1984) physi-
cally motivates the role of temperature and tells us that we
can study the eﬀect of a less rigid pinning by using a smooth
Y functional; for example one of the simplest possibilities is

(cid:18)|ω(x)| − ωcr(x)

where in the limit of “zero temperature and rigid vortices”
α → 0 we recover Eq. (25). The disadvantage with respect
to the original approach of Alpar et al. (1984) is that now α
has no direct physical interpretation.

L = 0 and vθ

Viscous drag - Another way to encode pinning that is
diﬀerent from Eq. (23) is to consider a large value of the drag
parameter η in the crust: suppose that η → ∞ in the interval
Rc < r < Rd, then d(x) → ∞ for every value of x. By
means of Eqs (18) and (19), we have vx
L = xΩp,
namely in the whole star all the vortices are pinned and
co-move with the p-component. The idea is thus to use a
viscous drag parameter η[ρ, ω] that has a local dependence
on the lag, so that η assumes a very high value when |ω(x)|
is well below ωcr. It is not surprising that a strong viscous
drag is equivalent to pinning, but the practical problem is
that for every value of ω(x) we have to calculate Bx(x) using
the opportune values η[ω(x), ρ(r)]. As an order of magnitude
estimate, η (cid:38) 1021 s cm g−1 in the crust is suﬃcient to give a
friction parameter ranging from Bx(0) ∼ 10−9 to Bx(Rd) ∼
10−12; this ensures that the vortices are almost blocked on
timescales of many years (cf. equation (35)). On the other
hand, a rapid expulsion of vortex lines occurs when η is such
that d(x) ≈ a(x) and the dissipation angle is nearly π/4.

3 MACROSCOPIC EQUATIONS FOR THE

TWO FLUID MODEL AND RELATION
WITH A RIGID MODEL

(27)

(26)

In the previous section we derived the macroscopic equa-
tions of our cylindrical model, Eqs (13) and (15), where the
physical (observable) quantity is Ωp. With the aid of the
deﬁnition given in Eq. (5) we can rewrite this system for
Ωv(x, t) and Ωp(t) in a more compact form as
∂tΩv(x, t) = −B[Ωv, Ωp, x] (2Ωv + x∂xΩv)(Ωv − Ωp)
∂tΩp(t) = −(1 + q) ˙Ω∞ − q(cid:104) ∂tΩv(t)(cid:105)
where q = Iv/Ip and ˙Ω∞ = Text/I, while the deﬁnition of
the cylindrical mean, weighted by dIv(x)/Iv = g(x)dx, is
given in Eq. (5). The ﬁrst remark is that the presence of en-
trainment does not modify the form of the above equations:
all the eﬀects of entrainment are contained in the renor-
malized quantities q and B, provided one uses as eﬀective
rotational variables Ωv(x, t) and Ωp(t), which are associated
to the eﬀective moments of inertia Iv and Ip respectively;
in this sense we can interpret the v-component, directly re-
lated to the vortex density, as the actual reservoir of angular
momentum when entrainment is present. Also, we can trig-
ger a glitch by perturbing the B functional (or by suddenly
increasing the Y fraction in some interval of the variable x):
this mimics the sudden unpinning of many vortices.

It is worth to note that if in Eq. (27) we constrain
∂tΩp = ∂tΩv for all the x values, it follows that the star
responds to the braking torque as a whole, with a spin down
rate of − ˙Ω∞. As usual, we refer to this situation as “steady-
state”; the value of ˙Ω∞ can be determined by observing the
mean spin down of the pulsar over a long period of time and
of course it is independent of entrainment.

As described in the previous section, the non-uniform
structure of the star and the presence of entrainment inﬂu-
ence the friction functional B, the ratio q and in particular
the cylindrical mean. On the other hand, the actual value
of the stellar radius plays no role since the above equations
do not change under the rescaling x → x/Rd and g → gRd,
where g was deﬁned in Eq. (6). As a direct consequence of

(cid:104)ω(cid:105) and Ωp, that depend only on time) and a diﬀerential
one δω(x, t):

the deﬁnition of g, we can calculate the angular momentum
of the diﬀerential v-component as

Lv(t) = Iv (cid:104)Ωv(x, t)(cid:105) .

It follows that, given a generic lag proﬁle ω(x), the reservoir
of angular momentum associated to the lag is
∆L[ω] = Lv − Iv Ωp = Iv (cid:104)ω(x)(cid:105) .

(28)

In the last section, we will describe how this fact can be used
to set an upper limit to the mass of a large glitcher like the
Vela.

3.1 Reduction to a rigid model

Most studies of pulsar glitches are based on body-averaged
models with two rigid components: an “observable compo-
nent” strongly coupled to the magnetic ﬁeld and an “inter-
nal component”. Some examples of this kind of approach
can be found in the early work of Baym et al. (1969) or in
the more recent studies of Andersson et al. (2012), Sidery et
al. (2010) and Jones (2002). The form of the mutual friction
is assumed to be linear in the velocity lag and the dynamical
equations are

Io ˙Ωo + Ii ˙Ωi = −I ˙Ω∞
˙Ωi = − Io
I

Ωi − Ωo

τ

,

(29)

(30)

where the label i (o) refer to the internal (observable) com-
ponent and τ is the phenomenological timescale that de-
scribes the coupling between the components.

In the original work of Baym et al. (1969), the aim was
to study the response induced by a sudden change in the mo-
ments of inertia, thus the two components are the crust (plus
the charged particles) and the totality of the superﬂuid neu-
trons; this gives Io ∼ 10−2I. On the other hand, under the
assumption that glitches arise in the inner crust superﬂuid
(taken as distinct from the core superﬂuid), the observable
component is comprised by the normal crust plus the total-
ity of the core, strongly coupled by “electron scattering oﬀ
magnetized vortex cores” (Bildsten & Epstein 1989; Link et
al. 1999), another manifestation of entrainment; in this case,
estimates of the moment of inertia of the superﬂuid in the
crust give Ii ∼ 10−2I, which is a quite small reservoir of
angular momentum (Pizzochero 2011).

As argued by Andersson et al. (2012), the fraction Ii/I
is signiﬁcantly lowered by entrainment, leading to serious
diﬃculties in explaining large glitches. For this reason we de-
cided to work under the assumption of vortex cores that pass
trough the core-crust interface (as in the snowplow model),
since this gives a larger angular momentum reservoir. It is
comforting that this choice is so far favored microscopically.
It is interesting to study under which conditions the
rigid model deﬁned by Eqs (29) and (30) can be a reasonable
approximation of Eqs. (26) and (27). For this purpose we
deﬁne the deviation δf of a generic function f as

f (x, t) = δf (x, t) + (cid:104)f (t)(cid:105)

and an “angular acceleration” quantity A(x, t) as
A = ((cid:104)B(cid:105) + δB)(2Ωp + 2(cid:104)ω(cid:105) + 2δω + x∂xδω)((cid:104)ω(cid:105) + δω) .
We can rewrite the Eqs (26) and (27) as a system of three
dynamical equations for two rigid variables (the mean lag

c(cid:13) 2016 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–13

δ ˙ω = −A + (cid:104)A(cid:105)
(cid:104) ˙ω(cid:105) = (1 + q)( ˙Ω∞ − (cid:104)A(cid:105))
˙Ωp = −(1 + q) ˙Ω∞ + q(cid:104)A(cid:105) .

(31)

(32)

(33)
It is possible to approximate A in such a way that the Eqs
(32) and (33) decouple from Eq. (31). A very general B func-
tional makes the problem analytically diﬃcult. On the other
hand we can restrict our attention to a ﬁnite time interval
during which we assume that the friction functional B does
not vary rapidly over time and can be approximated with an
eﬀective cylindrical proﬁle that is function of x only, namely
B ≈ Bx
eﬀ eventually accounts also for the frac-
tion Y . With this assumption, we can decouple equation (31)
from equations (32) and (33) by dropping the term x∂xδω
and taking in A only the terms that are up to ﬁrst order in
the deviations:

eﬀ(x), where Bx

(cid:104)A(cid:105) ≈ 2(cid:104)Bx

eﬀ(cid:105)(Ωp + (cid:104)ω(cid:105))(cid:104)ω(cid:105) ≈ 2(cid:104)Bx

eﬀ(cid:105) Ωp (cid:104)ω(cid:105) .

(34)
In this way the dynamics of Ωp and (cid:104)ω(cid:105) does not depend on
δω. Now, if we identify Ωo with Ωp and Ωi with Ωp +(cid:104)ω(cid:105), the
Eqs (32) and (33) are equivalent to Eqs (29) and (30), where
q = Ii/Io. We will see later that q ≈ 10− 20 for realistic star
parameters; thence we have a potentially large reservoir of
angular momentum. It also follows that the relaxation time
can be estimated as

−1 = 2(1 + q)(cid:104)Bx

eﬀ(cid:105)Ωp .

τ

(35)

The relaxation time given here should be intended as the
coupling timescale of a body-averaged model characterized
by (cid:104)Bx
eﬀ(cid:105). In this way, thanks to our cylindrical mean, we can
give a microphysical interpretation of the phenomenological
parameter τ . We have also shown that the entrainment eﬀect
does not change the form of the rigid equations, but only
aﬀects the values of Io, Ii (leaving I unchanged) and τ ,
without any need to introduce new terms.

4 NUMERICAL INTEGRATION OF THE

INPUT PROFILES

To use the dynamical equations (26) and (27) we ﬁrst need
to set the ratio q and the normalized function g(x). This
will ﬁx the structure of the star. These parameters depend
on the mass of the star and on the EOS of dense matter,
as well as on entrainment. On the other hand, all the infor-
mation about the dynamics of vortices is contained in B; if
the prescription of Eq. (23) is used, we have to calculate a
static drag-parameter proﬁle Bx(x) and the critical proﬁle
ωcr(x). These three functions of x and the number q are
the macroscopic “input proﬁles” of the model and can be
obtained from micro and mesoscopic physics using the in-
tegrations described in the previous sections; to construct
them we need the density proﬁle ρ(r) and the density de-
pendent quantities xn(ρ), n(ρ), η(ρ) and fp(ρ).

Since in this preliminary work we are dealing with New-
tonian moments of inertia, in order to keep the exposition
simple we do not implement the general relativistic conver-
sion between the baryon number density n and the energy
density ρ, namely we take n = ρ/mn and nn = xnρ/mn. We

fraction consistent with the GM1 EOS in the core (dashed line).
For densities below the drip point we have xn = 0 (no superﬂuid
neutrons are present). In the inner-crust xn is the fraction of

will study this aspect, by incorporating the prescriptions of
Haensel & Potekhin (2001) for a thermodynamically con-
sistent EOS as well as the corrections for slow rotation in
general relativity, in a dedicated future work.

4.1 Microphysical inputs

For a given central density and EOS we solve the TOV equa-
tions. This gives the total mass of the neutron star and the
density proﬁle ρ(r) so that we can express all the input pro-
ﬁles as functions of the spherical radius.

EOS - We use the SLy EOS proposed in Douchin &
Haensel (2001) as a consistent description of the whole star.
It provides the relation P (ρ) and the fraction of free super-
ﬂuid neutrons xn(ρ) (shown in Fig. 2). This equation of state
predicts a ﬁrst order phase transition where nuclear clusters
dissolve into homogeneous nuclear matter at baryon density
n ∼ 0.76 fm−3, corresponding to ρc ≈ 1.3× 1014 g cm−3. To
ﬁnd the value of Rd we assume that neutron drip appears
at density ρd = 4.3 × 1011 g cm3.

To study the dependence from the EOS we also use the
stiﬀer GM1 equation of state of Glendenning & Moszkowski
(1991) in the core, while keeping the SLy to describe the
crust. The corresponding xn fraction is shown in Fig 2. In
all the ﬁgures we measure the density in units of ρ0 = 2.8 ×
1014 g cm−3, the nuclear saturation density.

Entrainment - Superﬂuid entrainment in neutron stars
was studied by Chamel and collaborators in a series of arti-
cles. Here we use the eﬀective neutron mass m∗
n(ρ) given in
Chamel (2012) and in Chamel & Haensel (2006) for the crust
and the core respectively, as shown in Fig. 3. The entrain-
ment parameter is n = 1 − m∗
n/mn where mn is the bare
nucleon mass. Even though the neutron superﬂuid can ﬂow
without friction in the crust, it is entrained by nuclei thanks
to Bragg scattering by the crustal lattice (Carter et al. 2005).
The entrainment parameters that we use in this work are
n/mn and p = xnn/(1− xn).
easily obtained as n = 1− m∗

polating the values given in Chamel (2012), solid line) and in the
core (from Chamel & Haensel (2006), dashed line). The crust-core
interface is at ρc ≈ 0.47 ρ0.

Figure 4. The pinning force proﬁle per unit length fp used to
calculate ωcr in units of 1015 dyne/cm. We constrain the pinning
force proﬁle to be zero outside the density range ρd < ρ < ρc.

Pinning force - Another important ingredient of the
model is fp, the pinning force per unit length resulting from
the vortex-lattice interaction in the inner crust. Recently
Seveso et al. (2016) have proposed a numerical simulations
to evaluate fp(ρ) at diﬀerent densities in the inner crust,
which accounts for ﬁnite vortex tension and random orien-
tation with respect to the lattice. In particular we use one of
the pinning proﬁle corresponding to in-medium suppressed
pairing gap (the case β = 3 and L = 5000 of Seveso et
al. (2016), see table 3 therein), as shown in Fig. 4. Since
theoretical estimates suggest that the protons in the core
could form a type II superconductor, in principle the vortex
motion could also be impeded by the interaction with the
ﬂux tubes. However, following the phenomenological study
of Haskell et al. (2013) this pinning interaction should be
small (we are currently studying this issue along the lines of
Seveso et al. (2016)). For this reason we choose to constrain
fp to be zero outside the crust.

Viscous drag - The drag parameter η is, probably, the
most diﬃcult and less studied microphysical input that we
need: a realistic treatment of the drag exerted on vortices

Figure 5. Example of viscous drag parameter η(ρ): in the core
(ρ > 0.47ρ0) the dominant dissipative channel is the electron
scattering oﬀ magnetized vortex lines, thus η(ρ) is given by Eq.
(36). In the crust, for ρd < ρ < ρc, we consider two dissipative
mechanisms: the excitation of phonons in the crustal lattice (pur-
ple dashed line) or the excitation of Kelvin waves in the vortex
cores (red dotted line).

interval [0, 1]. In the insert we focus on the outermost cylindrical
shell and the arrows indicate the surfaces x = Rc for the three
masses.

implies the study of many dissipative phenomena, although
we can take into account only the dominant ones in each
region of the star. Andersson et al. (2006) give an estimate
of the drag on vortex lines due to the electron scattering oﬀ
magnetized cores as

where xp = 1 − xn, p = xnn/xp (Chamel & Haensel 2006)
and all the quantities are functions of density. The standard
picture is that vortices in the core are magnetized, due to the
entrainment eﬀect between the neutron superﬂuid and the
proton superconductor. For this reason the above estimate
is valid only for ρ > ρc, thus we take ηes = 0 in the crust.

On the other hand, as pointed out by Jones (1990a)
and Epstein & Baym (1992), for ρ < ρc the vortices excite
phonons in the crustal lattice. This eﬀect dominates the dis-
sipation when the relative velocity between the vortex line
and the lattice is small (|vL − vp| < 102 cm s−1). However,
at present only rough estimates of the drag parameter in the
crust can be found in literature. For this reason, we decide
to take as a title of example a ﬁducial constant value for
the “phononic” drag parameter in the inner crust, namely
ηph ∼ 102 g s−1cm−1. This choice is made on the basis of
the inferred parameters presented in Haskell et al. (2012),
see Table 1 therein.

When the velocity of vortex lines relative to the lat-
tice nuclei is much higher, other dissipative processes come
into the play. Following Jones (1992) in this case the dom-
inant dissipative process involves the creation of quasipar-
ticles (Kelvin waves) in the vortex cores. This phenomenon
is still little studied and only rough estimates are available
at the moment. However the phenomenological approach of
Haskell et al. (2012) tells us that the drag associated to
excitation of Kelvin waves is roughly seven orders of mag-
nitude greater than the phononic drag, thus we consider
ηkw ∼ 109 g s−1cm−1. Figure 5 shows the two full drag pro-
ﬁles as a function of the density given by Eq. (1); in both

integration over the vortex length gives a continuous proﬁle. Here
we used the SLy equation of state.

cases (“phononic” and “kelvonic”) the mechanism that dom-
inates dissipation in the core is given by Eq. (36).

The fact that for diﬀerent vortex velocities we have to
interpolate between the phononic drag and a kelvonic drag
is a direct manifestation of the approximation given in Eq.
(23): the power dissipated per unit length by a vortex is
not in general of the form η(vL − vp)2 and the assumption
of a velocity independent (or lag independent) parameter η
forces the dissipated power to be quadratic in the vortex
velocity. For this reason the prescription of a lag dependent
viscous drag given in Sec. 2.6 seems a viable choice for a
dynamical simulation. The diﬃculty is that to implement
this “viscous drag prescription” in a physically reasonable
way we need a better understanding of drag and pinning.

given by the electron scattering and there is nearly no diﬀerence

the insert we zoom the outermost cylindrical shell and the arrows
indicate the surfaces x = Rc for the three masses.

4.2 Numerical results

We use the physical inputs described in the previous section
to construct the proﬁles Bx(x), wcr(x) and g(x) by perform-
ing numerically the integrations over the z-axis for a given
cylindrical radius x. To study how the inputs of our model
are sensitive to a change of the EOS in the core, we decided
to use SLy and the stiﬀer GM1. For both cases (SLy for the
whole star or GM1 in the core plus SLy in the crust), some
structural parameters of the star are summarized in Table
1 for three diﬀerent masses. As expected, the stiﬀ equation
of state GM1 gives rise to smaller values of q.

In the following we present the results of the cylindri-
cal proﬁles for the SLy case only, since the proﬁles obtained
using GM1 in the core are qualitatively similar. Since we
want to compare stars with diﬀerent masses, and we al-
ready remarked that the actual value of Rd is irrelevant in
our model, the proﬁles are shown rescaling the cylindrical
radius to unity. In Fig 6 we plot the weight g(x), that is the
fundamental quantity that permits to take into account the
spherical geometry and the non-uniform structure of the star
by projecting it onto a cylindrical model. Since our cylindri-
cal averages are weighted by the moment of inertia, it is
clear that the behavior of g near the origin is ruled by the
factor x3, while the drop after the maximum depends on
the decreasing density and on the spherical shape of the
star; then the proﬁle of g is corrected by the details of the
EOS used and by the entrainment eﬀect. It is worth to note
that the mass of the star does not have a deep impact on
the overall shape of the normalized proﬁle g, thanks to the
fact that in our model we are free to rescale the cylindri-
cal radius. However by increasing the mass of the star we
ﬁnd that g tends to weight more the outermost cylindrical
layers for x (cid:38) 0.9 Rd. Moreover the cylindrical shells that
are completely immersed in the crust (namely for x > Rc)
contribute very little to the cylindrical averages and to the
total moment of inertia of the v-component, as can be seen
in the insert of Fig 6.

tron scattering in the core and either phononic or kelvonic

mass 1.1, 1.4 and 1.9 M(cid:12) using the SLy EOS. The critical lag
calculated without taking into account the entrainment eﬀect is
lower by one order of magnitude in the crust (Seveso et al. 2012).

Table 1. Some stellar structure parameters are given for three
diﬀerent masses (low, medium and high). Neutron drip begins at
the radius Rd that corresponds to a density ρd = 1.53 × 10−3 ρ0.
Similarly Rc is the core radius and corresponds to ρc ≈ 0.47 ρ0.
The upper panel refers to the SLy EOS. In the lower panel we
use the GM1 EOS, together with its consistent xn(ρ) in the core,
while in the crust nothing changes with respect to the SLy case.

drag in the crust. We label the total dimensionless drag Bx
in these two cases as Bx
kv. The dominant contribu-
tion from electron scattering in the core makes these two
proﬁles quite similar for x (cid:46) 0.6 Rd. Notice that switching
from phononic drag to kelvonic drag in the crust is relevant
also for vortex lines that are not completely immersed in the
crust (0.8 Rd (cid:46) x < Rc).

The critical lag ωcr given by Eq. (24) is shown in Fig.
9 for the SLy EOS. When GM1 is used in the core the re-
sult is qualitatively similar: the critical lag proﬁles, even in
presence of entrainment still have the typical peak of the
“snowplow-model”. This peak gets closer to the cylindrical
shell x = Rd as we increase the mass of the star. When GM1
is used in the core, the main diﬀerence with respect to the
SLy case is the higher value of the central plateau between
0.2 (cid:46) x/Rd (cid:46) 0.8.

Finally, in Fig. 10 we show the product g(x)ωcr(x) for
the SLy EOS; by deﬁnition, the area enclosed by each curve
is the mean critical lag (cid:104)ωcr(cid:105), listed in Table 2. It is worth
noting that the main contribution to this comes from regions
with x > 0.6 Rd, which do not contain the possibly exotic
inner core: the cylindrical angular momentum reservoir is
spread across the inner crust and the outer core of the neu-
tron star, with a distribution that has a sharp peak at the
bottom of the inner crust (see insert of Fig. 10).

5 AN APPLICATION: ESTIMATES OF THE

ANGULAR MOMENTUM RESERVOIR AND
OF THE SPIN-UP TIMESCALES

Here we brieﬂy show how some of the results developed in
the previous section can be useful to make quantitative es-
timates even without solving explicitly the equations of mo-
tion (26) and (27).

Firstly we give a rough estimate of the spin-up
timescale: we assume that the outward velocity after trig-
gering a large glitch event is given by Eq. (23) and that all
vortex lines unpin so that Y ∼ 1 everywhere. Thus the rigid
approximation of Sec. 3.1 implies that the spin-up timescale
can be deﬁned as

τkv =

4π(cid:104)Bx

P
kv(cid:105)(1 + q)

,

(37)

in complete analogy with Eq. (35): the body averaged re-
laxation time is the weighted harmonic mean of the local
relaxation times. This is reliable as long as repinning, or a
signiﬁcant change in the value of the friction functional, oc-
curs for times greater than τkv since the beginning of the
avalanche. Similarly we can calculate τph, that is the same
quantity but using Bx
ph. We list these values (in units of the
pulsar period P ) in Table 2. These values are only global
quantities, intimately related to the rigid approximation de-
scribed in Sec 3.1. Moreover the listed spin-up timescales are
referred to the extreme situation where all the vortex lines
are unpinned (Y = 1). For the Vela pulsar, using a period
P ∼ 0.09 s, all the listed spin-up timescales are less than
a minute and are particularly fast for a soft EOS like SLy.
They are deﬁnitely smaller than the present observational
“blind window” of about tobs ≈ 40 s (Dodson et al. 2002,
2007), thus pointing to fast dynamical transients that need
a much better timing resolution to be revealed: the ﬁrst few

c(cid:13) 2016 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–13

seconds of a glitch event may provide a direct insight into
the dynamics of superﬂuid vortices inside a pulsar.

To give an upper limit to the angular momentum reser-
voir, we must estimate the theoretical maximal glitch for
a given EoS and for diﬀerent masses. In turn, this can be
compared to observations in order to constrain the pulsar
mass. Conservation of total angular momentum before and
after the glitch reads

IΩp + Iv(cid:104)ωpre(cid:105) = I(Ωp + δΩp) + Iv(cid:104)ωpost(cid:105)

in terms of the initial and ﬁnal average lags. We can deﬁne
a maximal glitch amplitude by taking (cid:104)ωpre(cid:105) = (cid:104)ωcr(cid:105) and
(cid:104)ωpost(cid:105) = 0, namely a glitch where initially the whole star
is just subcritical (in the snowplow scenario, this maximizes
the angular momentum reservoir) while after the glitch the
average lag is reduced to zero and the reservoir is “empty”.
We thus obtain

δΩmax

=

(cid:104)ωcr(x)(cid:105) .

(38)

Note that we don’t require that after the glitch the lag is
everywhere null, but only that the lag is null in the mean
at a given instant after the triggering of the avalanche has
occurred. Although this maximal glitch does not correspond
to a real situation and is probably never realized dynami-
cally, it still sets an upper limit to the observed glitch am-
plitude. Indeed, a sketch (out of scale) of a typical large
glitch event is shown in Fig 11: the residuals with respect to
the pre-glitch angular velocity are shown for Ωp, while the
average (cid:104)Ωv(cid:105) follows from angular momentum conservation.
For large glitches, an overshoot of the p-component over the
v-component is expected. It is clear that δΩmax
is not re-
ally the maximum value of the frequency jump, but rather
it is the diﬀerence between the value of Ωp when the mean
lag is instantaneously zero and the initial Ωp(ttr). Now, the
very short spin up timescales that we ﬁnd by putting Y = 1
suggest that for a large glitch (where all vortices have been
unpinned thus maximizing the avalanche) the overshoot is
realized on timescales comparable to τkv, namely a few sec-
onds for the Vela pulsar.1 Thus if we observe a glitch ampli-
tude δΩobs about a minute after the triggering event (say at
time tobs, corresponding to the observational blind window)
we can be conﬁdent that we are observing the glitch am-
plitude after the condition of “null lag” has occurred (see
Fig 11), so that δΩmax
is actually un upper limit for the
observed glitch. Conversely, any dynamical simulation will
give a glitch amplitude (measured at times well after the
short-time transients) which is smaller than δΩmax
; there-
fore only stellar structures that permit to obtain a δΩmax
greater than the largest observed glitch are physically ac-
ceptable for a given pulsar. Some values of δΩmax
are listed
in Table 2 for diﬀerent EOS and stellar masses. For example,
looking at the listed values of δΩmax
, we can conclude that
a mass of 1.4 M(cid:12) is enough to reproduce the maximum ob-
served glitch of the Vela (≈ 2.1 × 10−4 rad/s) when the SLy
EoS is used. With more values than those listed we ﬁnd the

1 The large glitches of Vela in 2000 and 2004 (Dodson et al. 2002,
2007) show that after a few minutes the crust is still relaxing to
the pre-glitch spin-down, but with timescales of order 104 s, much
larger than τkv and τph.

more stringent limit MV ela < 1.45 M(cid:12). The stiﬀer GM1 al-
lows for larger masses but still rules out the possibility that
the Vela is a very massive neutron star (MV ela < 1.8 M(cid:12)).
These upper bounds to the mass of the Vela can only be low-
ered by the observation of future, even larger glitch events.
Note that the identiﬁcation of the Vela as an intermediate-
mass neutron star has also been proposed on the basis of its
peculiar surface cooling (Yakovlev & Pethick 2004).

Of course we can repeat this line of reasoning for all
pulsars that display large glitches, but a detailed discussion
and improvement of the estimate of the angular momentum
reservoir will be given in a dedicated work. Here our aim is
just to propose that the largest glitch observed in each pulsar
can put a constraint on the pulsar mass. This approach to
constrain some star properties through glitch observations is
very diﬀerent when compared to the estimate of the moment
of inertia fraction using the activity parameter (Link et al.
1999; Andersson et al. 2012); indeed, the activity parameter
is a mean quantity over many decades of pulsar evolution,
while here we take the largest observed event, which may be
a better indicator of the pulsar’s glitching strength.

6 CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have developed a dynamical model for su-
perﬂuid pulsars, that can take into account consistently the

spherical, non-uniform structure of the star, the diﬀerential
rotation of the superﬂuid and the presence of strong entrain-
ment. The main result of the paper is the set of dynamical
equations, Eqs.(27) and (26), which describe the exchange
of angular momentum between two eﬀective components,
characterized by moments of inertia Iv and Ip, determined
by entrainment, and whose angular velocities are Ωv(x, t)
and the observable Ωp(t). They constitute the mathemati-
cal framework for future simulations and modelling of pulsar
glitches. Even without solving explicitly the equations, we
were able to draw some general quantitative conclusions; in
particular, we have sketched a new method to estimate an
upper bound to the mass of a large glitcher using observa-
tions; this will be the core part of a future work.

A central feature of the quantitative example described
in the previous section concerns the nature of superﬂuid vor-
tices extending across the crust-core interface. As explained
before, we consider that the change in the symmetry of the
order parameter (from the S-superﬂuid to the P-superﬂuid)
may aﬀect the vortex core structure but doesn’t decouple
the core superﬂuid and the crustal superﬂuid. In most of
the existing literature the reservoir of angular momentum
is instead restricted to the crustal superﬂuid. However An-
dersson et al. (2012) pointed out that with the inclusion of
entrainment the superﬂuid into the crust has not enough
mobility to ﬁt the activity parameter of many pulsars (in
particular the large glitchers, like the Vela). In our model
with continuous vortices, also the vortex lines that are not
totally immersed in the crust (x < Rc) play an important
role and the reservoir of angular momentum is enough to
reproduce the largest glitch observed in the Vela, provided
its mass is not too large.

In our treatment we tried to point out that all the com-
plex behavior of the rearrangement of vortex conﬁgurations
is hidden into the functional B, introduced in Eq. (17). In
our estimates of the maximal masses and of the spin up
timescales we used the simple form of B given by Eq. (23).
However it is always possible to reﬁne the model with better
proposals for B and to study the consequences on the dy-
namics of the observable variable Ωp. The numerical study
of a glitch induced by a massive unpinning of vortex lines is
the issue of a future work. Of course, this kind of simulation
makes more sense if it can eventually be compared to better
resolution timing data: the ﬁrst few seconds of a glitch with
their massive exchanges of angular momentum may be far
more revealing and constraining for the star structure than
the later post-glitch evolution.

We want to stress that, despite the possible criticism
on some of the hypothesis used in this work, it is important
to look for simpliﬁed but clear prescriptions to create body-
averaged models. Here we tried to make a ﬁrst step in this
direction, using the hypothesis of long and rigid vortex lines
in a Newtonian framework (we used the TOV equations for
the structure of the star, but the classical moments of in-
ertia). At this point it is quite simple to introduce general
relativistic corrections for slow rotation, and to test diﬀerent
EoS and alternative input proﬁles for pinning, entrainment
and drag.
