LELONG NUMBERS, COMPLEX SINGULARITY EXPONENTS,

AND SIU’S SEMICONTINUITY THEOREM

QI’AN GUAN AND XIANGYU ZHOU

Abstract. In this note, we present a relationship between Lelong numbers
and complex singularity exponents. As an application, we obtain a new proof
of Siu’s semicontinuity theorem for Lelong numbers.

R´ESUM´E. Dans cette note, nous pr´esentons une relation entre le nombre de
Lelong et exposants de singularit´es complexes. Comme application, nous
obtenons une nouvelle preuve de semicontinuit´e th´eor`eme de Siu pour les
num´eros Lelong.

1. Introduction

Let ϕ be a plurisubharmonic function near the origin o ∈ Cn. The Lelong number

is deﬁned as follows

Deﬁnition 1.1. ν(ϕ, o) := sup{c ≥ 0 : ϕ ≤ c log |z| + O(1)}.

In [19], Siu established the semicontinuity theorem for Lelong numbers, i.e., the
upper level set of Lelong numbers is analytic. After that, Kiselman [15] general-
ized Siu’s semicontinuity theorem for directed Lelong numbers.
In [2], Demailly
introduced a generalized Lelong number and generalized the above result of Kisel-
man. And then, Demailly (see [5]) gave a completely new and simple proof of Siu’s
theorem by using Ohsawa-Takegoshi L2 extension theorem.

In this note, we present a new proof of Siu’s theorem by establishing a relation-

ship between Lelong numbers and complex singularity exponents.

Now let us recall the deﬁnition of the complex singularity exponent using the
concept of multiplier ideal sheaf I(ϕ) (see [22], see also [3, 5]) (also called log
canonical threshold in algebraic geometry see [18, 17]):

Deﬁnition 1.2. The complex singularity exponent at o is deﬁned to be

co(ϕ) := sup{c ≥ 0 : I(cϕ)o = Oo}.

Our main result is the following:

Theorem 1.3. Let ϕ be a plurisubharmonic function on D ⊂⊂ Cn with coordinates
z = (z1, · · · , zn) containing the origin. Then for any k ∈ N, there exist plurisubhar-
monic functions ϕk near the origin of Cn × C(2k−1)n with coordinates (z, w) such
that

(1) ϕk(z, o) = ϕ(z);
(2) ν(ϕk, (z, o)) = ν(ϕ, z);
(3) (2k−1)n
for any z ∈ D, where o is the origin in C(2k−1)n.

ν(ϕ,z) ≤ c(z,o)(ϕk) ≤ 2kn

ν(ϕ,z)

The second inequality in (3) can be directly deduced by Skoda’s result in [21]

combined with (2).

Remark 1.4. It is clear that (3) in Theorem 1.3 is equivalent to

(2k − 1)n

2kn

ν−1(ϕ, z) ≤ c(z,o)((2kn)ϕk) ≤ ν−1(ϕ, z),

which implies

{ν(ϕ, z) ≥

(2k − 1)n

2kn
(2k−1)n

c} ⊇ {c(z,o)((2kn)ϕk) ≤

1
c

} ⊇ {ν(ϕ, z) ≥ c}.

Note that limk→+∞

2k n = 1, then we obtain

{z|ν(ϕ, z) ≥ c} = ∩k({z|c(z,o)((2kn)ϕk) ≤

1
c

}).

By Berndtsson’s solution of openness conjecture [1] posed by Demailly and Kollar

[6] (for a proof in two dimensional case see [9, 8, 7]), it follows that ({z|c(z,o)((2kn)ϕk) ≤
1
c }) is analytic for any k ∈ N and c > 0, which deduces the following Siu’s semi-
continuity theorem for Lelong numbers [19] (For Demailly’s new proof, the reader
is refereed to [5] and [4])

Corollary 1.5. [19] {z|ν(ϕ, z) ≥ c} is an analytic set.

We would like to thank the referee for pointing out that Berndtsson’s solution of
openness conjecture used above to deduce Corollary 1.5 might be replaced by the
H¨omander-Bombieri theorem as in Kiselman’s proof of Siu’s theorem.

2. Preparation

2.1. Restriction formula about complex singularity exponent and Lelong
number. Let ϕ be a plurisubharmonic function on a neighborhood of the origin
o ∈ Cn. In [6], the following restriction formula (”important monotonicity result”)
about complex singularity exponents is obtained by using Ohsawa-Takegoshi L2
extension theorem.

Proposition 2.1. [6] For any regular complex submanifold (H, o) ⊂ (Cn, o),

(2.1)
holds, where ϕ|H 6≡ −∞, and o′ emphasizes that co′(u|H ) is computed on the sub-
manifold H.

co′(ϕ|H ) ≤ co(ϕ)

We recall the following restriction property of Lelong numbers.

Lemma 2.2. (see [5]) For any regular complex submanifold (H, o) ⊂ (Cn, o),

(2.2)
holds, where ϕ|H 6≡ −∞, and o′ emphasizes that ν(ϕ|H , o′) is computed on the
submanifold H.

ν(ϕ|H , o′) ≥ ν(ϕ, o)

2.2. Lelong number and complex singularity exponent for U (n) invariant
plurisubharmonic functions on Cn. We recall the following characterization of
U (n) invariant plurisubharmonic function (see Lemma III.7.10) in [5]).

Lemma 2.3. (see [5]) Let ϕ be a plurisubharmonic function on Bn which is U (n)
invariant. Then ϕ = χ(log |z|), where χ is a convex increasing function.

The folllowing remark is a direct consequence of Lemma 2.3

Remark 2.4. (see [5]) Let ϕ be a plurisubharmonic function on Bn which is U (n)
invariant. Then co(ϕ) = n

ν(ϕ,o) .

Proof. By Deﬁnition 1.1, it is clear that

ν(ϕ, o) = lim

t→−∞

χ(t)

t

,

i.e. for any ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for any |z| < δ,

(ν(ϕ, o) + ε) log |z| ≤ ϕ(z) ≤ (ν(ϕ, o) − ε) log |z|,

which deduces the present remark by directly calculating.

2.3. A holomorphic map and Lelong number. Deﬁne a holomorphic map pm
from Cm × Cm to Cm with coordinates (z1, · · · , zm, w1, · · · , wm) and (˜z1, · · · , ˜zn)
such that

pm(z1, · · · , zm, w1, · · · , wm) = (z1 − w1, · · · , zm − wm).

Let ϕ be a plurisubharmonic function on D ⊂ Cm, then p∗

m(ϕ) is well-deﬁned

on p−1

m (D) ⊂ Cm × Cm.

Lemma 2.5. The construction of p∗
statements hold:

m(ϕ) implies that for any z0 ∈ D the following

m(ϕ)(z0, o) = ϕ(z0);

(1) p∗
(2) ν(p∗

m(ϕ), (z0, o)) = ν(ϕ, z0) = ν(p∗

m(ϕ)|z=z0 , (z0, o)′), where (z0, o)′ empha-

sizes that ν(p∗

m(ϕ)|z=z0 , (z0, o)′) is computed on the submanifold {z = z0}.

Proof. By deﬁnition of pm, it follows that (1) and the second equality of (2) hold.

m(ϕ), (z0, o)) ≤ ν(ϕ, z0) by Lemma 2.2.

By (1), it follows that ν(p∗
It suﬃces to consider the case z0 = (0, · · · , 0) ∈ D. It is clear that p∗

m log |˜z| =
log |z − w| ≤ log(|z| + |w|). Then, for any c > 0 satisfying ϕ ≤ c log |˜z| + O(1)
(z → 0), we have p∗
m log |˜z| + O(1) ≤ c log(|z| + |w|) + O(1), which implies
ν(p∗

mϕ ≤ cp∗
m(ϕ), (z0, o)) ≥ ν(ϕ, z0).
The lemma is proved.

(cid:3)

2.4. An invariant property of Lelong numbers. Let ϕ be a plurisuharmonic
function on Ω ⊂ Cn × Cm containing the origin, and let (z, w) denote the coordi-
nates. One can deﬁne

˜ϕ(z, w) := sup

ϕ(z, gw)

g∈U(m)

on a U (m) invariant neighborhood of Ω∩{w = o}. It is a plurisubharmonic function.

By deﬁnition 1.1, it follows that

Lemma 2.6. One has ν( ˜ϕ, (z0, o)) = ν(ϕ, (z0, o)) and ν( ˜ϕ|z=z0 , (z0, o)′) = ν(ϕ|z=z0 ,
(z0, o)′) hold for any (z0, o) ∈ (Ω ∩ {w = o}).

3. proof of Theorem 1.3

Let m ∼ 2jn (j = 0, 1, · · · , k − 1) as in Lemma 2.5, where ∼ means that the
2k−1n◦

former is replaced by the latter. We consider the plurisubharmonic function p∗
· · · ◦ p∗

n(ϕ) on domain in C2kn.

By Lemma 2.5, it follows that
(1) p∗
(2) ν(p∗

2k−1n ◦ · · · ◦ p∗
2k−1n◦· · ·◦p∗

n(ϕ)(z, o) = ϕ(z);
n(ϕ), (z0, o)) = ν(ϕ, z0) = ν(p∗

for any z0 ∈ D and origin o ∈ C(2k−1)n.

2k−1n◦· · ·◦p∗

n(ϕ)|{z=z0}, (z0, o)′)

Let ϕk(z, w) := supg∈U((2k−1)n)(p∗
By Lemma 2.6 (the ﬁrst and third equalities) and (2) (the third and fourth

equalities), it follows that

ν(ϕk|{z=z0}, (z0, o)′) = ν(p∗
= ν(p∗
= ν(ϕk, (z0, o)) = ν(ϕ, z0).

2k−1n ◦ · · · ◦ p∗
2k−1n ◦ · · · ◦ p∗

n(ϕ)|{z=z0}, (z0, o)′)
n(ϕ), (z0, o))

(3.1)

By Remark 2.4 (Cn ∼ {z = z0} ∩ C2k n(= {(z0, w) : w ∈ C(2k−1)n}), ϕ ∼

ϕk|{z=z0}, n ∼ (2k − 1)n), it follows that

ν(ϕk|{z=z0}, (z0, o)′) =

(2k − 1)n

c(z0,o)′(ϕk|{z=z0})

.

From Proposition 2.1, equality 3.2 and equality 3.1, it follows that

c(z0,o)(ϕk) ≥ c(z0,o)′(ϕk|{z=z0}) =

(2k − 1)n

ν(ϕk|{z=z0}, (z0, o)′)

=

(2k − 1)n
ν(ϕ, z0)

.

Thus we ﬁnish proving the present theorem.
