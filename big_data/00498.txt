We consider the proximity eﬀect between Dirac states at the surface of a topological insulator
and a ferromagnet with easy plane anisotropy, which is described by the XY -model and undergoes
a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase transition. The surface states of the topological
insulator interacting with classical magnetic ﬂuctuations of the ferromagnet can be mapped onto
the problem of Dirac fermions in a random magnetic ﬁeld. However, this analogy is only partial
in the presence of electron-hole asymmetry or warping of the Dirac dispersion, which results in
screening of magnetic ﬂuctuations. Scattering at magnetic ﬂuctuations inﬂuences the behavior of
the surface resistivity as a function of temperature. Near the BKT phase transition temperature we
ﬁnd that the resistivity of surface states scales linearly with temperature and has a clear maximum
which becomes more pronounced as the Fermi energy decreases. Additionally at low temperatures
we ﬁnd linear resistivity, usually associated with non-Fermi liquid behavior, however here it appears
entirely within the Fermi liquid picture.

INTRODUCTION

The discovery of topological insulators (TI) has led
to new ways to observe exotic physics in condensed
matter systems, including phenomena such as magnetic
monopoles and axion electrodynamics [1, 2]. Many of
these insights rely on the nature of the TI surface states,
which are described by the Dirac equation for relativistic
particles (see [3, 4] and references therein). The com-
bination of TI and magnetic materials creates a hybrid
platform to observe new physics by exploiting the spin-
momentum locking of surface states. These dual-layer
structures provide a way to experimentally realize disor-
dered Dirac hamiltonians and localization phenomena in
TI systems [5, 6].

Uniform out-of-plane magnetization, which can be in-
duced by proximity eﬀect or by ordered impurities de-
posited at the surface of a TI, opens a gap in the sur-
face state spectrum [7]. This gapped state exhibits the
anomalous quantum Hall eﬀect, which can be directly
probed in transport or by magnetooptical Faraday and
Kerr eﬀects [8–14]. Out-of-plane magnetic textures such
as domain walls and skyrmions host gapless chiral modes
or localized states, altering their dynamics [15–18]. As
a result, the strong interplay of magnetism and surface
states can be employed in spintronics applications.

In contrast, non-uniform in-plane magnetization can
act as an eﬀective gauge ﬁeld. Dirac fermions exposed
to transverse gauge ﬁeld disorder, or a random mag-
netic ﬁeld (RMF), have been studied theoretically in the
context of the integer quantum Hall transition [19], su-
perconductivity [20–22], spin liquids [23], and disordered
graphene [24] (see [5] for a review). RMF disorder can
strongly renormalize the spectrum and inﬂuence trans-
port properties in both Schr¨odinger and Dirac electron
systems and leads to localization in the former [25–28].

A single Dirac cone will not localize in a short-range
RMF, however whether localization occurs the case of
long-range RMF presently lacks a deﬁnitive answer [29–
35]. The search for new experimental systems where the
strength and spatial correlation of the magnetic ﬁeld can
be tuned is essential in the eﬀort to understand the RMF
problem.

In this work, we consider such a system via the prox-
imity eﬀect between the surface of a TI and a thin-ﬁlm
magnet with easy plane anisotropy, which we describe by
the XY -model. The XY -model enables magnetic vor-
tex excitations and undergoes a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-
Thouless (BKT) phase transition, corresponding to vor-
tex unbinding. We have shown that classical magnetic
ﬂuctuations of the XY -model can be represented as an
emergent static RMF acting on Dirac fermions, where the
range of disorder is temperature dependent. Quasi-long-
range gauge disorder below the BKT transition temper-
ature is in general unscreened and can strongly inﬂuence
Dirac states, making the problem intractable by usual
perturbation methods. However, we note that this gauge
ﬁeld analogy is not full in the presence of electron-hole
asymmetry or warping terms, which depend on the dop-
ing level [36]. These terms lead to screening and the
system can be tuned from the perturbative to nonper-
turbative regime by doping. We analyze transport in the
doped, perturbative regime and we show that the resistiv-
ity has a prominent maximum near the BKT transition
temperature, where magnetic ﬂuctuations are the most
intense.

In Section II we present the model and discuss the
mapping of classical magnetic ﬂuctuations to static RMF
disorder. In Section III we discuss the range of applica-
bility of the perturbative treatment of the disorder. In
section IV we calculate the temperature behavior of re-
sistivity in the perturbative regime.
In Section V we

conclude and relate our work to current experiments.

II. MODEL

The purpose of this work is to show how signatures of
an eﬀective gauge ﬁeld can be observed in transport of
Dirac fermions. Coupling the Dirac states to a magnetic
system with in-plane magnetic moments that undergoes
a phase transition, like the 2D XY model, allows for a
system with tunable gauge disorder. The Dirac surface
states of a 3D TI coupled to the XY -model can be de-
scribed by the following action

S = SXY + STI + SXY

(2)

The surface states are represented by a two-component
spinor ψ = (ψ↑, ψ↓)T , σ = (σx, σy) is the vector of
Pauli matrices representing the real electron spin, v is
the Fermi velocity, and ∆ > 0 is the interlayer coupling
between surface states and a magnetic XY -model with
magnetic moments n(r) = (cos(θ), sin(θ)) with θ(r) de-
scribing their direction.

If electron-hole asymmetry is neglected (α = 0), the
magnetization plays the role of an emergent gauge ﬁeld
a = ∆v−1 [n × ˆz]. It can be split as a = al + at into
a transverse part, responsible for the emergent magnetic
ﬁeld Bz = [∇ × at]z = ∆v−1(∇nl) perpendicular to the
surface, and a longitudinal part, which can generate an
emergent electric ﬁeld E = −∂tal = −∆v−1∂tnt. Here
nl and nt are the corresponding components of spin den-
sity. Magnetic ﬂuctuations are assumed to be classical,
leading to zero emergent electric ﬁeld, and therefore the
longitudinal gauge ﬁeld can be safely gauged away.

The XY model in 2D describes magnetic moments
with ﬁxed magnitude and arbitrary angle in the x-y
plane. Low energy modes are described by the contin-
uum model SXY in equation (2) with temperature T
and spin-wave stiﬀness ρS. The Mermin-Wagner the-
orem forbids long-range ordering in 2D at all nonzero
temperatures [37, 38]. However, the spin-spin corre-
lation function exhibits unusual behavior, decaying al-
gebraically at low temperatures ∝ r−η where η(T ) =
T /2πρs is the critical exponent, which takes values from
η(0) = 0 to ηBKT(TBKT) = 1/4. The correlation func-
tion is ∝ exp(−r/ξ+) for T > TBKT. Near the transi-
tion the correlation length ξ+(T ) is given by ξ+(T ) ≈
a exp(3TBKT/2√T − TBKT), where a is cutoﬀ for the
magnet of the order of the vortex core size, which in
turn is similar to the lattice constant of the magnet.
ξ+(T ) is ﬁnite only above the BKT transition and di-
verges exponentially as T → T +
BKT [39, 40]. The transi-
tion between these two regimes, referred to as the BKT

2

transition, is driven by the unbinding of magnetic vortex-
antivortex pairs and occurs at TBKT = πρs/2. The XY -
model can occur in magnetic thin ﬁlms with strong in-
plane anisotropy, and has been realized in several com-
pounds including K2CuF4, Rb2CrCl4, BaNi2(VO4)2 and
(CH3NH3)2CuCl4 [41–47].

Excitations of the magnetic XY -model θ(r) = θsw(r)+
θv(r) are spin-waves θsw(r), creating a smooth emergent
magnetic ﬁeld Bz, and vortices θv(r), which generate a
nonunifrom magnetic ﬁeld in a very nonlocal way. For
a set of vortices situated at ri, the distribution of phase

is θv(z) = Pi qi arg(z − zi) with z = x + iy and qi =
± for vortices and antivortices. The resulting magnetic
ﬁeld is given by Bz = ∆v−1[cos(θ)∂yθsw − sin(θ)∂xθsw +
Pi qi cos(θi)/|r − ri|] with θi = θsw(r) +Pj6=i qj arg[z −
zj].
It diverges in the vicinity of each vortex core and
its magnitude depends nonlocally on the position of all
other vortices and slowly decays away from the vortex
cores.

The reconstruction of the local electronic structure due
to the nonuniform spin density n(r) near the vortex core
can be probed by tunneling experiments, as considered
in detail in the case of magnetic impurities [48, 49]. Here,
we are interested in transport of Dirac fermions due to
scattering at magnetic ﬂuctuations where the chemical
potential lies far above the Dirac point.
In this case,
scattering is restricted to the conduction band, and the
vortex contribution to the eﬀective magnetic ﬁeld leads
to an eﬀective RMF as the conduction electrons see many
vortices.

The interaction between Dirac fermions mediated by
spin ﬂuctuations is obtained by integrating out the spin
ﬂuctuations and expanding to the second order in ∆/µ.
The ﬁrst order term vanishes; the second order term Sd,
corresponding to a disordered static magnetic ﬁeld, reads

For T < TBKT, ξ+ → ∞ and the propagator is V0(q) ∝

strong temperature dependence through η.
In 2D this
leads to an infrared divergence in the self-energy which
cannot be treated in a controlled manner in the absence
of screening [50]. Particularly, in the random phase ap-
proximation (RPA) the screened interaction is given by

V −1(q) = V −1

It is zero for q ≤ 2kF, which signals the absence of screen-
ing. Physically, vanishing Πl(0) implies the absence of
uniform spin polarization in the TI in the presence of a
uniform external spin density n. Really, n can be safely
gauged away through a transformation which shifts the
position of a Dirac point qD = ∆v−1[n × ez], and there-
fore does not lead to any response.
Above we have neglected electron-hole asymmetry
(α = 0) in the Hamiltonian, describing electrons at the
surface of the topological insulator.
In Bismuth based
topological insulators it is not negligible, but usually
does not change the physics qualitatively (see [51, 52]
for an exception). Here we point out that the presence
of electron-hole asymmetry or warping is crucial since it
breaks the connection to the emergent gauge ﬁeld pic-
ture. As a result, the spin-spin response function at low
momenta becomes ﬁnite and allows screening. Recall-
ing that Πl(0) is the response to the uniform spin den-
sity, corresponding to momentum shift of Dirac states
qD = ∆v−1[n × ez], the resulting average spin polariza-
tion of electrons sD = hψ†σψi is given by
2|p − qD|(cid:21) nF(αp2 + v|p− qD|− µ), (8)
sD =Xp (cid:20)ez ×

where nF(ǫp) is the Fermi step-like distribution at zero
temperature. To linear order in n and α we get sD =
− ¯αnνF∆/2 with νF = µ/2π2v2 the density of states of
Dirac electrons at the Fermi level and ¯α = αµ/v2 the
dimensionless electron-hole asymmetry strength, which
leads to Πl(0) = − ¯ανF∆/2. The spin polarization van-
ishes in the absence of electron-hole asymmetry as ex-
pected. The screened interaction in RPA mediated by
magnetic ﬂuctuations at T < TBKT is then given by

The strength of electron-hole asymmetry, which regular-
izes our theory, can be characterized by the dimension-
less parameter ¯α which decreases with the chemical po-
tential µ and vanishes in the undoped regime. As a re-
sult, by controlling the doping level the system can be
tuned from the perturbative to non-perturbative regime.

FIG. 1: (color online) Resistivity of TI surface states coupled
to an XY model. The resistivity scales linearly with tempera-
ture as T → 0 and across the BKT transition, with a nonuni-
versal peak at T ∼ TBKT that increases with increasing µ. As
µ increases the eﬀect of the transition is less pronounced.

To clarify the range of applicability of the perturbative
approach, we consider the renormalization of the single-
particle spectrum.

from the conduction band and their Green’s function is

where ϕp denotes the polar vector of a fermion with mo-
mentum p.
If the scattering is elastic |p| = |p − q|,
trigonometry dictates 2ϕq−ϕp−ϕp−q = π and ¯Qp,p−q =
1. Re Σ(0, pF) at the Fermi level leads to Fermi energy
renormalization, and it is zero for this case.
Inserting
the screened propagator, equation (9), into (10) gives a

The product of gamma functions is of order 1 for 0 <

The single particle life time diverges in the absence
of screening, where ξα → ∞ for ¯α → 0, as expected. It

cannot be cured by using the self-consistent Born approx-
imation and signals the break down of the perturbative
approach, which we use below for a calculation of con-
ductivity of Dirac fermions. The apparent breakdown of
perturbation theory in this model could also signal the
existence of a non-Fermi liquid state on the TI surface, a
possibility which could be explored by including the dy-
namics of the BKT magnet, which is beyond the scope
of this work.

In the presence of screening, the Fermi-liquid approach
breaks down for γ & µ. Using equations (9) and (12)
we ﬁnd a lower bound on the Fermi energy

For µ < µc this approach is no longer valid and the sys-
tem could be tuned from the perturbative to nonper-
turbative regime by doping. We estimate for Bi2Te3,
v = 0.5 × 106 m/s, ∆ = 10 meV and α = 1/2m∗ with
m∗ ∼ 0.1me. At T = TBKT, ηBKT = 1/4 which gives
µc & 6 meV. However, it is also important to keep in
mind that for µ . ∆ higher order terms in the expan-
sion (3) become important and are not considered here.
We leave the non-perturbative regime to further investi-
gations which could be informed by this type of experi-
ment.

IV. TRANSPORT OF DIRAC FERMIONS

In the doped regime at µ ≫ γ, the quasipartcle pic-
ture is well deﬁned and the resistivity of Dirac fermions
can be approximated by the Drude formula

can be easily separated. Here we concentrate on elas-
tic scattering due to magnetic ﬂuctuations, where for
|q| = 2kF sin ϕ/2 the corresponding contribution is given
by

rate γ, the inverse transport time τ −1
tr does not diverge in
the absence of screening and weakly depends on screen-
ing length ξα. Therefore, in the equation (15) we used
the unscreened propagator V0(q) given by equation (5).
Nevertheless, we need to keep in mind that the deriva-
tion of Drude formula implies γ ≪ µ since all diagrams

with crossed impurity lines, which are important in the
opposite regime, are neglected [53]. Using equation (14)

where ∆T = T − TBKT and ψ is the digamma func-

regimes but has a diﬀerent slope in each case. As T → 0,
the dynamics of the magnetic moments becomes impor-
tant, necessitating a fully quantum theory which is not
considered here. The slope is dictated by µ and changes
signiﬁcantly with doping as shown in Figure 1. The tem-
perature of maximal resistivity is also dictated by µ; it
occurs for T ∼ TBKT but is nonuniversal. It can be solved
for using the exact expression in equation (16). We note
that for µ < 13 meV the slope is always negative for
T > TBKT and the maximum resistivity occurs before
the transition.

In a real experiment there will be many sources of scat-
tering including phonons and non-magnetic impurities.
The linear temperature dependence and sharp peak near
the BKT transition enables the separation of this scat-
tering mechanism from others in the system. Scattering
due to impurities is temperature independent, while at
low temperatures phonon scattering leads to a diﬀerent
scaling law.

V. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION

Physical realization of Dirac fermion-gauge ﬁeld mod-
els in TI systems relies heavily on the strength of mag-
netic perturbations to the TI system. In this section we

5

provide some estimations of the coupling strength ∆ and
how it connects to current experiments. For the 3D TI
Bi2Te3 we use µ = 0.1 eV. The transport lifetime in
Bi2Te3 can be inferred from transport measurements to
be τ0 ∼ 10−12 s [54]. The short distance cutoﬀ a is esti-
mated by the half the lattice constant of two dimensional
BKT magnet K2CuF4, where a ∼ 2.5 ˚A [42].
In order to observe the anomalous transport behavior
described above, the coupling between the magnetic layer
and the TI must be strong enough such that τtr . τ0.
The transport time τtr at T = TBKT is found from equa-
tion (15), where

Dirac fermions coupled to an XY -model as temperature
is tuned through the BKT transition. We claim that
both short-range and quasi long-range disorder can be
realized, and the transition between these regimes can
be tuned by both doping level and temperature, thus
determining the strength and nature of the disorder. We
have analyzed the resistivity at high doping and we ﬁnd
that it scales linearly with temperature, with a prominent
peak at the BKT transition temperature where magnetic
ﬂuctuations are the strongest. Notably, the resistivity
also scales linearly with temperature as T → 0. The
eﬀect is strengthened by decreasing the Fermi energy.
