Abstract

Quantum localization of classical mechanics within the BRST-BFV and BV (or ﬁeld-
antiﬁeld) quantization methods are studied. It is shown that a special choice of gauge
ﬁxing functions (or BRST-BFV charge) together with the unitary limit leads to Hamil-
tonian localization in the path integral of the BRST-BFV formalism. In turn, we ﬁnd
that a special choice of gauge ﬁxing functions being proportional to extremals of an initial
non-degenerate classical action together with a very special solution of the classical master
equation result in Lagrangian localization in the partition function of the BV formalism.

Introduction and Summary

In Theoretical Physics, one considers usually how to quantize complex dynamical systems,
possibly with nontrivial geometry of phase space or constraints of both classes, by observing
precisely all the fundamental Physical Principles [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Although the general quantiza-
tion problem is of great importance, it is also very interesting to realize what is the status of
the classical dynamics from the point of view of the quantum theory. In other words, it is inter-
esting to study, how to formulate a version of the quantum theory capable, in a consistent way,
to suppress all quantum ﬂuctuations in a given dynamical system, so that the functional path
integral reduces to the delta - functional concentrated at the classical trajectory, multiplied by
the Jacobian of the argument of the delta - functional with respect to the trajectory. That is
exactly what we actually mean when saying about the general quantum localization. There
exist a rather numerous series of articles where such a program has been realized and studied
[6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. One of the most known approaches is to introduce, in a Hamiltonian dynamics,
in addition to the usual Boson time, the two Fermion time components [10]. The linear coef-
ﬁcients of a series expansion of the trajectory in the new Fermion times become then a kind
of Hamiltonian ghosts, while the quadratic coeﬃcients become Lagrange multipliers yielding
just the delta - functional concentrated at the classical trajectory. In turn, the Hamiltonian
ghosts yield the Jacobian required of the delta - functional. Although that approach by itself
looks very nice, it seems that the idea of two Fermion extra times is rather artiﬁcial. On the
other hand, in that scheme, the localization is essentially discreet, in the sense that there is no
”parameter” interpolating continuously, as ”switching on” quantum ﬂuctuations.

In the present article, we suggest to use the well-known BRST - BFV scheme invented
originally for generalized canonical quantization of relativistic dynamical systems with ﬁrst -
class constraints [11, 12]. We suggest an unusual form for the BRST - BFV charge and gauge
Fermion, and show that there exists such a choice of the gauge - ﬁxing functions that, in the
unitary limit, the path integral reproduces exactly the general Hamiltonian localization.
In
that limit, the Lagrange multipliers and antighosts become dynamically passive, which leads
naturally to the appearance of the set of the delta - functionals necessary as to the localization.
In contrast to the genuine relativistic gauge theories, now the gauge - ﬁxing functions is intended
to kill the dynamically active Lagrange multipliers to the gauge ﬁxing itself, which looks a bit
paradoxical, like an attempt of taking one from a bog by using the Munchausen trick. However,
that is actually the case. In the approach suggested, just the gauge - ﬁxing function plays the
role of an interpolation ”parameter” switching on quantum ﬂuctuations.

Further, as we have known that the whole ﬁeld - antiﬁeld formalism [13, 14] is derived from
the BRST-BFV quantization scheme [15, 16, 17, 18], it appears quite natural that there should
be possible to describe the localization phenomenon just in the language of the ﬁeld - antiﬁeld
formalism, as well. We realize that program, by formulating a very speciﬁc version of the
classical master - action. The action is a homogeneous linear function of the antiﬁelds, so that it

2

vanishes at zero values of the ones. There is no term of the zero order in the antiﬁelds. The latter
circumstance makes it possible for the unity matrix to stand for the ”gauge generator”. Then,
we also introduce a very speciﬁc version to the gauge - ﬁxing function, which is proportional
to the extremal of the original action. As a coeﬃcient of that proportionality, we allow for an
invertible ﬁeld-dependent metric. There also included the term proportional to the Nakanishi -
Lautrup ﬁelds, with the coeﬃcient being the delocalization parameter. As a result, at the zero
value of the delocalization parameter, we arrive at the functional path integral for the partition
function, where the integration over the Nakanishi - Lautrup - ﬁelds yield the delta - function
of the extremal of the original action, while the integrations over the ghosts and antighosts
yield the corresponding Jacobian correct. On the other hand, if the delocalization parameter is
not zero, there appears the Gaussian distribution of the classical extremal, instead of the delta
- function. In fact, as the metric and the delocalization parameter do enter the functional path
integral via the gauge - ﬁxing only, the whole partition function is independent of them, due
to the standard general arguments [12, 13, 14, 19, 20].

2 Hamiltonian localization in the BRST-BFV formalism

Let S be an original Hamiltonian action of some nonsingular dynamical system,

S = Z dt(cid:20)1

2

Z AωAB ˙Z B − H(Z)(cid:21) ,

(2.1)

where Z A are phase variables, ε(Z A) = εA, ωAB is a constant invertible symplectic metric,
H(Z) is a non-degenerate original Hamiltonian. The action (2.1) yields the standard equations
of motion,

˙Z A = {Z A, H(Z)}ω = ωAB∂BH(Z).

(2.2)

Now, we would like to perform a localization to the equation of motion (2.2) via the following
extended action W ,

W = Z dthPA ˙Z A + ΠA ˙ΛA + ¯PA ˙C A + ¯CA ˙P A − Hi ,

(2.3)

in relativistic phase space of canonical pairs with the values assigned of the Grassmann parities,
ε, and ghost number, gh, original phase variables:

(PA, Z A),

ε(Z A) = ε(PA) = εA,

gh(Z A) = −gh(PA) = 0;

dynamically active Lagrange multipliers:

(ΠA, ΛA),

ε(ΛA) = ε(ΠA) = εA,

gh(ΛA) = −gh(ΠA) = 0;

ghost phase variables:

( ¯PA, C A),

ε(C A) = ε( ¯PA) = εA + 1,

gh(C A) = −gh( ¯PA) = 1;

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

3

antighost phase variables:

( ¯CA, P A),

ε(P A) = ε( ¯CA) = εA + 1,

gh(P A) = −gh( ¯CA) = 1.

(2.7)

The unitarizing extended Hamiltonian is given by

H = {Ψ, Ω},

where gauge Fermion Ψ and BRST charge Ω are

Ψ = ¯PAΛA + ¯CAχA,

ε(Ψ) = 1,

gh(Ψ) = −1,

(2.8)

(2.9)

Ω = H

←−
∂AC A + ΠAP A,

ε(Ω) = 1,

gh(Ω) = 1,

{Ω, Ω} = 0,

(2.10)

where χA are just gauge - ﬁxing functions, ε(χA) = εA, gh(χA) = 0, which may depend on
all the phase variables, and ∂A is everywhere a partial Z A - derivative. The minimal form
(2.8) of the unitarizing Hamiltonian H is directly related to the possibility to use actually the
so-called quantum/derived antibrackets [21, 22, 23, 24] as to describe dynamical systems with
ﬁrst-class constraints (see [25] for details); see also [26, 27] for the modiﬁed description of the
time evolution for general gauge systems.

By substituting (2.9), (2.10) into (2.8), we get the following explicit form of the unitarizing

extended Hamiltonian,

H = H

←−
∂A ΛA + ΠAχA + ¯CA{χA, ΠBP B} + ¯CA{χA, H

←−
∂BC B} + ¯PAP A.

(2.11)

All the Poisson brackets in (2.8) - (2.11) are deﬁned with respect to the canonical pairs in (2.4)
- (2.7). In terms of the extended action (2.3), the partition function reads

Z = Z DΓ exp(cid:26) i



W(cid:27) ,

(2.12)

where DΓ is a trivial integration measure over all the phase variables (2.4) - (2.7).

Due to the standard general arguments based on the Poisson - bracket nilpotency of Ω in
(2.10), the partition function (2.12) is independent of the gauge Fermion Ψ, and thereby of the
gauge - ﬁxing functions χA [11]. On the other hand, for general χA, of course, the functional
path integral (2.12) is not localized to a solution to the classical equation of motion (2.2), with
the Jacobian of the corresponding delta functional being compensated exactly. We will show
however that there exists such a choice for χA that the required localization is the case in the
unitary limit of the path integral in (2.12). So, let us deﬁne the unitary limit in the usual way.
As the partition function (2.12) is independent of χA, let us formally rescale the latter

χA → α−1χA,

(2.13)

4

where α is a parameter. Then, let us make the following unimodular change of integration
variables in (2.12),

ΠA → αΠA,

¯CA → α ¯CA.

(2.14)

Now, let us go to the limit α → 0. It is easy to see that the structure of the Hamiltonian (2.11)
is preserved under the limit. The only result of the unitary limit in the extended action W is
that the second and fourth kinetic terms in the integrand in (3) become absent, so that the
Lagrange multipliers (2.5) and antighosts (2.7) become dynamically - passive variables. It is
now the case to choose a special gauge - ﬁxing,

χA = ΛA − PB ωBA.

(2.15)

In the latter case, the ΠA - integration yields the delta functional δ[Λ − P ω], while the P A -
integration yields the delta-functional δ[ ¯P + ¯C]. By integrating out these delta - functionals,
we have to substitute

ΛA = PB ωBA,

¯PA = − ¯CA,

so that the ﬁnal action becomes

Wf inal = Z dt[PA( ˙Z A − ωAB∂BH) − ¯CA( ˙C A − ωAC−→

∂C H

←−
∂BC B)].

Here, the PA - integration yields the delta-functional

δ[ ˙Z − {Z, H}ω],

(2.16)

(2.17)

(2.18)

while the ¯CA and C B - integrations yield exactly the Jacobian of the argument in (2.18) with
respect to Z. Thus, we have reproduced exactly the result of Hamiltonian localization.

Now, it is worth to compare the ﬁnal action (2.17) to the known approach based on the use of
the two extra time Fermionic variables θa, a = 1, 2, where one proceeds with the two-parametric
superﬁeld action of the form [9, 28]

W ′ = Z dtd2θ [

1
2

Z AωAB ˙Z B − H(Z)], ωAB = const(Z),

(2.19)

where

Z A(t, θ1, θ2) = Z A

3 (t),

0 (t) + θaZ A

a (t) + δ2(θ)Z A

is the component expansion of the two-parametric superﬁeld,

d2θ = dθ1dθ2,

δ2(θ) =

θaεabθb,

Z d2θ δ2(θ) = 1,

Z d2θ θaθb = −εab,

5

(2.20)

(2.21)

(2.22)

while (2.21), (2.22) represent the two-parametric integration measure, delta-function, and the
normalization properties. Due to (2.20) - (2.22), the action (2.19) rewrites in the component
form

W ′ = Z dt [Z A

3 (ωAB ˙Z B

εab(Z A

(2.23)

It follows when comparing (2.17) to (2.23) that the variables do identify as

Z A

3 ωAB = PB, Z A

1 ωAB = ¯CB, −Z B

2 (−1)εB = C B.

(2.24)

Notice that the explicitly N = 2 supersymmetric form of the action (2.19) reads [29]

W ′ = Z dtd2θ[−

4

DaZ A ωAB gabDbZ B(−1)εB − H(Z)],

(2.25)

where covariant superderivatives are given by

with

Da =

∂

∂θa + gab θb ∂

∂t

,

gab = gba = const,

ε(gab) = 0,

(2.26)

(2.27)

being an invertible symmetric constant metric, and gab being an inverse to the latter. Due to
the supercommutation relations

[Da, Db] = 2gab

∂
∂t

,

(2.28)

the explicitly N = 2 supersymmetric action (2.25) coincides exactly with the one (2.19) after
integration by part.

3 Some possible generalizations

We have demonstrated an interesting possibility of the Hamiltonian generalized BRST-BFV
formalism [11, 12], being a very powerful quantization method of arbitrary dynamical systems
with constraints, to describe a phenomena of the Hamiltonian localization of classical mechanics.
To achieve this result it was necessary to change the standard view on gauge ﬁxing functions
of the BRST-BFV approach allowing them to depend on the variables of the auxiliary sectors
rather than on the initial phase space variables. Then, using the fact of the gauge independence
of the partition function constructed by the rules of the BRST-BFV method, an application
of the unitary limit procedure allowed one to make the Lagrange multipliers and the antighost
variables dynamically - passive. As the last step in our proof of the Hamiltonian localization,
it was a special choice of the gauge ﬁxing functions in the BRST-BFV formalism.

6

Now, we would like to make a backward step as to explain our understanding of what is
the meaning of minimal Hamiltonian delocalization. Let us modify slightly the unitary gauge
(2.15),

χA = ΛA − PAωBA +

1
2

gABΠB,

where gAB is an invertible matrix with the property of dual antisymmetry,

gAB = −gBA(−1)(εA+1)(εB +1).

Write down the gauge ﬁxing term in (2.11), with the gauge (3.1) substituted for (2.15),

ΠAχA = ΠA(ΛA − PB ωBA) +

1
2

ΠA gAB ΠB.

(3.1)

(3.2)

(3.3)

With nonzero invertible gAB, the Lagrange multipliers ΠA enter quadratically (3.3), so that
in the functional path integral, in the unitary limit, the ΠA integration yields a Gaussian
distribution of the unitary gauges (2.15), instead of the delta - functional of (2.15). That is
actually what we mean when saying about the minimal Hamiltonian delocalization.

Finally, let us discuss another important aspect of the construction. So far, we assumed the
original symplectic metric ωAB as being constant. Now, let us allow the metric be dependent
of the original phase variables Z A, although satisfying the Jacobi relation,

ωAB ←−

∂D ωDC(−1)εAεC + cycle(A, B, C) = 0.

(3.4)

In order to have the original equations of motion be derivable from the action of the form (2.1),
we have to modify the latter as follows (for details see [20])

1
2

ωAB → ¯ωAB = (N + 2)−1ωAB, N = Z A∂A.

(3.5)

If one looks at the formula (2.17), it becomes clear that the ¯CA, C B integrations yield the
←−
∂ B applies both to H and to ωAC. On the other hand,
correct Jacobian only if the operator
←−
∂ B to the H only. To
our above arguments are only capable to justify applying the operator
resolve that problem, we should modify the gauge Fermion Ψ (2.9), (2.15) as

Ψ → Ψ +

(−1)εD ¯PD ¯PAωAD←−

∂B C B.

1
2

Then the unitarizing Hamiltonian H (2.8), (2.11) modiﬁes as

H → H + ¯PAωAD←−
∂B

−→
∂DHC B(−1)εBεD .

(3.6)

(3.7)

which results exactly in the formula (2.17) where in the right-hand side, in the integrand, in
←−
∂B applies both to H and to ωAC. Thereby, the ¯C, C
the second term, the left derivative
integrations yield exactly the Jacobian of the argument of the delta function yielded via the P
integration in the ﬁrst term in the integrand.

4 Lagrangian localization in ﬁeld-antiﬁeld formalism

As we have known that the whole ﬁeld-antiﬁeld formalism is derived from the Hamiltonian
BRST- BFV quantization scheme [11, 12], it appears quite natural to expect that there should
be possible to describe the localization phenomenon just in the language of the ﬁeld - antiﬁeld
formalism, as well. Let us begin with determining the set of anticanonical pairs of the ﬁeld-
antiﬁeld phase variables, with the values assigned of the Grassmann parity, ε, and ghost number,
gh. For general ﬁeld variables, ΦA, and their antiﬁelds, Φ∗

A, we have

ε(ΦA) = εA,

ε(Φ∗

A) = εA + 1,

gh(ΦA) + gh(Φ∗

A) = −1.

For any functions F, G on the antisymplectic phase space, the antibracket is deﬁned by

(F, G) = F (

←−
∂A

−→
∂ A

∗ −

←−
∂ A

∗

−→
∂A)G,

(4.1)

(4.2)

where ∂A and ∂A

∗ is the ΦA and Φ∗

A - derivative, respectively.

Now, we proceed with the following speciﬁc set of anticanonical pairs.

1. Original phase variables: φi, φ∗
i ,

ε(φi) = εi,

ε(φ∗

i ) = εi + 1,

gh(φi) = 0,

gh(φ∗

i ) = −1;

(4.3)

2. Nakanishi - Lautrup phase variables: Bi, B ∗i,

ε(Bi) = εi,

ε(B ∗i) = εi + 1,

gh(Bi) = 0,

gh(B ∗i) = −1;

(4.4)

3. Ghost phase variables: C i, C ∗
i ,

ε(C i) = εi + 1,

ε(C ∗

i ) = εi,

gh(C i) = 1,

gh(C ∗

i ) = −2;

4. Antighost phase variables: ¯Ci, ¯C ∗i,

ε( ¯Ci) = εi + 1,

ε( ¯C ∗i) = εi,

gh( ¯Ci) = −1,

gh( ¯C ∗i) = 0.

Now, let S(φ) be an original action whose Hessian,

Hik =

−→
∂i S

←−
∂k ,

(4.5)

(4.6)

(4.7)

is invertible at the extremals. Here ∂i is the φi - derivative. Next, we deﬁne the following
classical master - action,

S = φ∗

i C i + Bi ¯C ∗i,

ε(S) = 0,

gh(S) = 0,

(S, S) = 0.

(4.8)

The gauge - ﬁxing Fermion has the form,

Ψ = ¯Ciχi,

ε(Ψ) = 1,

gh(Ψ) = −1,

(4.9)

8

where just the gauge - ﬁxing function is deﬁned by

χi = gik(∂kS +

1
2

κBk),

ε(χi) = εi,

gh(χi) = 0,

(4.10)

κ is the delocalization parameter. Metric gik is invertible and allowed to depend on φi, it has
the dual anti-symmetry property,

gik = −gki(−1)(εi+1)(εk+1).

The quantum partition function reads

Z = Z DφDBDCD ¯C exp(cid:26) i



SΨ(cid:27) ,

where the gauge - ﬁxed master - action is

SΨ = S|φ∗=∂Ψ, ¯C ∗=χ = ¯Cigik(

−→
∂kS +

1
2

κBk)

←−
∂j C j + Bigik(

−→
∂kS +

1
2

κBk).

(4.11)

(4.12)

(4.13)

As the metric gik and delocalization parameter κ do enter via the gauge ﬁxing (4.10) only, the
partition function is independent of them, due to the standard general arguments [12, 13, 14,
19, 20]. Formally, for κ = 0, the Bi - integration yields the delta - function of the extremal of
the action S, while the ¯Ci, C k - integrations yield the corresponding Jacobian correct.

The solution chosen (4.8) for the classical master - action is a very speciﬁc one.

It is a
homogeneous linear function of the antiﬁelds, so that it vanishes at zero values of the ones.
There is no term in (4.8) of zero order in the antifelds. The latter circumstance makes it
possible to choose the unity matrix to stand for the ”gauge generator”.
