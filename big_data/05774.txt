The diphoton excesses at 750 GeV seen in the LHC data may be the ﬁrst hint for new physics at
the TeV scale. We discuss variations of the model considered earlier, in which one or more diphoton
excesses arise from composite pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons (hidden pions) associated with new
strong dynamics at the TeV scale. We study the case in which the 750 GeV excess arises from a
unique hidden pion leading to a diphoton ﬁnal state as well as the case in which it arises from one
of the hidden pions decaying into diphotons. We consider SU (N ), SO(N ), and Sp(N ) gauge groups
for the strong dynamics and ﬁnd that SO(N ) and Sp(N ) models give extra hidden pions beyond
those in the SU (N ) models, which can be used to discriminate among models.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The recently announced diphoton excess at 750 GeV [1–4] may be the ﬁrst hint for physics beyond the standard
model at the TeV scale. In Ref. [5], we have proposed, based on stability of the theory and the strength of the signal,
that this excess results from a composite spin-0 particle decaying into a two-photon ﬁnal state. In Ref. [6], we have
studied a particularly simple version of this, in which the 750 GeV particle is a composite pseudo Nambu-Goldstone
boson associated with new strong dynamics at the TeV scale which is singly produced by gluon fusion and decays into
two photons. In particular, we have studied a model that has an extra gauge group GH = SU (N ) at the TeV scale, in
addition to the standard model gauge group GSM = SU (3)C×SU (2)L×U (1)Y , with extra matter—hidden quarks—in
the vectorlike bifundamental representation of GH and SU (5) ⊃ GSM. We have studied detailed phenomenology of
pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons—hidden pions—one of which is the 750 GeV diphoton resonance. For related work
involving similar dynamics, see Refs. [7–10].
In this paper, we study two classes of variations of the minimal model in Refs. [5, 6]. For deﬁniteness, we keep the
GSM quantum numbers of the hidden quarks to be 5 + 5∗ of SU (5) ⊃ GSM, motivated by grand uniﬁcation. (Note
that SU (5) here is used as a mnemonic; it does not mean that the three factors of GSM are actually uniﬁed at the TeV
scale.) In the ﬁrst class, we consider models in which a single diphoton resonance arises from a unique GSM-singlet
hidden pion. After reviewing the GH = SU (N ) model in Refs. [5, 6], we discuss models with GH = SO(N ) and
Sp(N ). Other than being possible variations, these models have an additional motivation that the matter content is
consistent with simple SO(10) grand uniﬁed theories. We study symmetry breaking patterns and hidden pion contents,
and we predict the spectra of hidden pions under the condition that the GSM-singlet hidden pion is responsible for
the 750 GeV excess. We ﬁnd that SO(N ) and Sp(N ) models have extra hidden pions beyond those in the SU (N )
model, which can be used to discriminate among models. In fact, in terms of the hidden pion phenomenology, the
models discussed here essentially cover the whole possibilities with the hidden quarks in a single representation of GH
and 5 + 5∗ of SU (5) ⊃ GSM. In the second class, we consider models in which multiple (two) diphoton resonances
arise from hidden pions. In Ref. [6], it was found that this can occur if the model contains an extra hidden quark
that is charged under GH but singlet under GSM. (Introduction of such an extra hidden quark was motivated by
cosmology there.) We study GH = SU (N ), SO(N ), and Sp(N ) models in this class. We demonstrate how parameters
of the models are determined and how other, GSM-charged hidden pion masses are predicted once the two diphoton
resonances are observed.

The organization of this paper is as follows. In Section II, we discuss models in which a single diphoton resonance
arises from hidden pions. Models with GH = SU (N ), SO(N ), and Sp(N ) are considered in three subsections.
In Section III, we discuss models in which two diphoton resonances arise from hidden pions. Again, models with
GH = SU (N ), SO(N ), and Sp(N ) are considered.

II. MINIMAL MODELS FOR THE 750 GEV RESONANCE

Here we discuss variations of the minimal model in Refs. [5, 6]. After reviewing salient features of the model in
Section II A, we present variations in which the hidden gauge group is changed from SU (N ) to SO(N ) and Sp(N )
in Sections II B and II C, respectively. We discuss the symmetry breaking pattern and hidden pion spectrum in each
case. We ﬁnd that the SO(N ) and Sp(N ) models have extra hidden pions beyond those in the SU (N ) case.

A. GH = SU (N )

The model has a hidden gauge group GH = SU (N ), with dynamical scale Λ ≈ O(TeV), and hidden quarks charged

under both GH and the standard model gauge groups, GSM, as in Table I.1 The hidden quarks have mass terms

L = −mDΨD ¯ΨD − mLΨL ¯ΨL + h.c.,

(1)
where we take mD,L > 0 without loss of generality, and we assume mD,L (cid:46) Λ. Note that the charge assignment of the
hidden quarks is such that they are a vectorlike fermion in the bifundamental representation of GH and SU (5) ⊃ GSM,
so that the model preserves gauge coupling uniﬁcation at the level of the standard model. Throughout the paper, we
assume that the hidden sector preserves CP to a good accuracy.

The strong GH dynamics makes the hidden quarks condensate

These condensations do not break the standard model gauge groups, but they break the approximate SU (5)× SU (5)
ﬂavor symmetry of the GH gauge theory to the diagonal SU (5) subgroup. The spectrum below Λ therefore consists
of 24 hidden pions, whose quantum numbers under GSM = SU (3)C × SU (2)L × U (1)Y are

ratio r ≡ mD/mL [6]. In the left panel of Fig. 1 we show the masses of hidden pions ψ, χ, and ϕ as functions of r
for N = 6. If mD and mL are uniﬁed at a conventional uniﬁcation scale (around 1014–1017 GeV), then their ratio
at the TeV scale is in the range r (cid:39) 1.5 – 3, with the precise value depending on the structure of the theory above
the TeV scale. In the right panel, we show these masses at r → ∞ as functions of N . In drawing these plots, we
colored hidden pions ψ and χ are relatively light, mψ (cid:46) 1.6 TeV and mχ (cid:46) 1.2 TeV, unless N is very large, N > 10.
We stress, however, that these masses are depicted under the assumption that σ(pp → φ → γγ)13 TeV = 6 fb. If this
rate is smaller, then the value of f , and hence Λ, becomes larger. This makes the hidden pion masses larger because
of larger gauge loop contributions. For detailed phenomenology of these hidden pions, see Ref. [6].

We now discuss the case with GH = SO(N ). We assume that the hidden quarks transform as the vector represen-

that the matter contents in the SO(N ) model discussed here and the Sp(N ) model discussed in the next subsection

So far, we have discussed models in which GH = SU (N ), SO(N ), and Sp(N ), and the hidden quarks are funda-
mental representations of GH . The analysis can be easily extended to other representations. Since chiral symmetry
breaking is expected to occur in the same way (other than, possibly, some special cases [13]), physics of the hidden
pions in models with hidden quarks in complex, real, and pseudo-real representations are identical with those of the
models with the hidden quarks in the fundamental representations of GH = SU (N ), SO(N ), and Sp(N ), respectively.

III. MODELS WITH TWO DIPHOTON RESONANCES FROM HIDDEN PIONS

Here we consider models in which the two diphoton resonances arise from hidden pions. In Ref. [6], it was found
In that
that this can occur if the model has an extra hidden quark charged under GH but singlet under GSM.
paper, the introduction of such an extra hidden quark was motivated by cosmology. In Section III A, we study the
GH = SU (N ) model in detail, identifying one of the two resonances as the 750 GeV diphoton resonance. In particular,
we demonstrate how parameters of the models are determined and how the other hidden pion masses are predicted
once the two diphoton resonances are observed. We describe SO(N ) and Sp(N ) variants in Sections III B and III C,
respectively.

we can determine the value of f as a function of the mixing angle θ between φ±. This is plotted in Fig. 4.
Under the conditions of Eq. (35), the properties of the second eigenstate φ+ are determined by m+ and θ. In Fig. 5,
we show the contours of σ(pp → φ+ → γγ)13 TeV in the θ/π-m+ plane. The dark shaded region cannot be obtained
under m− (cid:39) 750 GeV. The light shaded region is either excluded by the ATLAS 13 TeV [3] or CMS 8 TeV [14]
data or outside the regime in which the hidden pion picture is valid. (As mentioned in Ref. [6], it is possible that
m− (cid:39) m+ (cid:39) 750 GeV, explaining the apparent wide width of the 750 GeV excess. Our present analysis does not
include this case, which requires us to take σ(pp → φ− → γγ)13 TeV < 6 fb.)
There are two qualitatively diﬀerent regions to notice. In the ﬁrst region

(cid:46) 0.3,

(36)

φ− is mostly φ while φ+ is mostly η. In this region, we have viable parameter space for a wide range of m+; in
particular, for 0 (cid:46) θ/π (cid:46) 0.3, m+ can be smaller than a TeV. The diphoton rate σ(pp → φ+ → γγ)13 TeV is of
O(0.1 – 1 fb). In the second region

the mass of φ+ must be large, m+ (cid:38) 1.4 TeV. In this region, the identity of the two eigenstates φ± is almost opposite
to the case above: φ− ∼ η and φ+ ∼ φ. The diphoton rate σ(pp → φ+ → γγ)13 TeV is again of O(0.1 – 1 fb).

Below, we demonstrate if the second diphoton excess is observed, how parameters of the models are determined
and how we can make further predictions. For this purpose, we choose a benchmark point from the second region,
where the diphoton rate is larger than the ﬁrst region for the same value of m+. Motivated by a slight excess in the
ATLAS data (although it is not signiﬁcant) [1, 3], we choose

m+ (cid:39) 1.6 TeV,

(38)

and θ ∼ π/2.
In the left panel of Fig. 6, we plot the values of the hidden quark masses mD,L,N that reproduce
Eqs. (35, 38) as functions of θ, around θ ∼ π/2. Here, the value of the decay constant f is determined so that
σ(pp → φ− → γγ) = 6 fb is obtained at
s = 13 TeV; see Fig. 4. In the dark shaded regions, no choice of mD,L,N
may reproduce the required φ± masses. The light shaded region is excluded because of too large diphoton rates. In
the right panel of Fig. 6, we plot predictions for the production cross section of φ+ times the branching ratios into two
electroweak gauge bosons at
s = 13 TeV. We ﬁnd that the diphoton rate is indeed observable size, as anticipated

from Fig. 5. With Eqs. (35, 38), the masses of all the other hidden pions are determined as functions of θ, as in Fig. 7.
Similar analyses can be performed for any other values of m+ once the second excess is seen.

In Fig. 7, we have also depicted the mass of the hidden η(cid:48), determined by the naive scaling [15]

where a1 is an O(1) coeﬃcient, and Λ is determined from f using Eq. (9). (The hidden η(cid:48) mass also has a contribution
from the hidden quark masses, which we absorb into the deﬁnition of a1.) In the plot, we have chosen a1 = 1 for
deﬁniteness. We ﬁnd that the hidden η(cid:48) is relatively light; this is because for θ ∼ π/2 the value of the decay constant
f required to reproduce the 750 GeV excess is smaller than that for θ ∼ 0 (or in the model without an extra hidden
quark); see Fig. 4 and Eq. (11). The couplings of the hidden η(cid:48) with the standard model gauge bosons can be estimated
by the U (1)A anomaly as

(This expression is valid in the large N limit, and we expect that it gives a good approximation even for moderately
large N .) In particular, the hidden η(cid:48) also decays to a diphoton ﬁnal state, with the rate σ(pp → η(cid:48) → γγ)13 TeV ≈
O(fb). While the estimate of the hidden η(cid:48) mass is subject to relatively large uncertainties, we expect from the plot
that mη(cid:48) is larger than m+, at least, for some region of θ and m+. In this case, the diphoton excess associated with
η(cid:48) appears above the second diphoton excess.

The relatively small value of f also implies that the dynamical scale Λ and hence the masses of higher resonances
are also smaller. In particular, C-odd and P -odd spin-one resonances, which we call hidden rho mesons, have masses
about Λ and are expected to be lighter than in the model without an extra hidden quark. The hidden rho mesons that
have the same GSM quantum numbers as the standard model gauge bosons mix with them and are singly produced
at the LHC. This gives lower bounds on the hidden rho meson masses. A particularly strong bound comes from
the hidden rho meson that has the same GSM charges as ϕ, which we refer to as ρϕ. This particle decays into an
electroweak gauge boson and ϕ, with ϕ subsequently decaying into a pair of electroweak gauge bosons. (The decay
of ρϕ into a pair of ϕ is kinematically forbidden.) The search for a resonance decaying into W ±γ [16] excludes the
ρϕ mass smaller than about 2 TeV. While this constrains the parameter space, the model is still viable given the
theoretical uncertainties associated with the estimate of the hidden rho meson masses and the fact that these masses
are larger for larger N , scaling as
We ﬁnally mention that even if CP is not preserved in the hidden sector, the decay of φ+ into two φ−’s is prohibited
in the limit mD = mL because of the enhanced ﬂavor symmetry. This limit occurs at θ/π (cid:39) 0.5 for m+ = 1.6 TeV;
see the left panel of Fig. 6. Therefore, for such values of θ/π, the model provides the second diphoton excess from
hidden pions even if CP invariance in the hidden sector is not postulated.

B. GH = SO(N )

For GH = SO(N ), we may add a Majorana fermion Ψ as an extra hidden quark, transforming as the vector
representation of SO(N ). Here we consider this minimal setup, shown in Table V, although it is straightforward to
extend the analysis in the case of multiple extra hidden quarks.

breaks the approximate SU (11) ﬂavor symmetry to SO(11), so we have 120 − 55 = 65 hidden pions. Speciﬁcally, in
addition to ψ, χ, ϕ, φ, ξ, λ, and η of the SU (N ) case (see Eq. (23)), we have hidden pions in Eq. (14).

Physics of the diphoton resonances is essentially the same as in the SU (N ) case, so we can simply repeat the
analysis in the case of GH = SU (N ). For example, if we set m+ = 1.6 TeV, the resulting hidden pion spectrum is as
given in Fig. 7 for ψ, χ, ϕ, φ, ξ, λ, and η and in Fig. 8 for the SO(N ) pions of (6, 1)−2/3, (3, 2)1/6, and (1, 3)1.

C. GH = Sp(N )

For GH = Sp(N ), the condition of global anomaly cancellation [17] requires us to introduce two Weyl fermions Ψ1,2
that transform as the fundamental representation of Sp(N ). The matter content of this minimally extended model is
given in Table VI.

λ(cid:48). Physics of the diphoton resonances is again essentially the same as in the SU (N ) case. For m+ = 1.6 TeV, the
masses of the Sp(N ) hidden pions, (3, 1)2/3, (3, 2)1/6, and (1, 1)1, are given in Fig. 9. The masses of ξ and ξ(cid:48) and of
