CATEGORIFIED PRESHEAVES AND SIEVES

SAIKAT CHATTERJEE

Abstract. Let C be a category of a set of (small) categories. This
paper concerns with the Cat-valued presheaves and sieves over
category C . Since Cat is not a concrete category, existing deﬁnition
of presheaves can not deal with the situation. This paper proposes
a new framework for the purpose. The main result is a version of
Yoneda embedding for Cat-valued presheaves, and construction of
the Cat-valued sieves over the category O(B) of subcategories of
a given topological category B.

1. Introduction

The objective of this paper is to propose a framework for Cat-valued
presheaves and sieves. This paper can be considered as the ﬁrst part of
a sequel. The second part [13] contains the discussions on Cat-valued
sheaves. On one hand, this paper provides the necessary mathematical
accessories required for the second part. On the other, it lays the
foundation for a paper under preparation (jointly with A Lahiri, and
A N Sengupta), which extends the construction of sieves in this paper
to Grothendieck topologies on a “topological category”.

Recall a presheaf, for a given category C, is a contravariant functor

[6,15,17]

(1.1)

R : Cop −→ Set,

where Set is the (locally small) category of small sets. C is often chosen

to be the category eO(B) of open subsets of a topological space B, that

is,

(1.2)

Obj(cid:18)eO(B)(cid:19) := {U| U ⊂ B},

Hom(U, V ) := {f : U

/ V | U, V ⊂ B}.

In (1.1) instead of Set, we may take any other concrete category. For
instance by taking category of (small) groups Grp, category of (small)

vector spaces Vect or category of (small) rings Ring as the codomain
in (1.1), and we respectively get presheaf of groups, presheaf of vector
spaces or presheaf of rings.

Now suppose instead of a topological space B, we are concerned with
a category B, whose both object and morphism spaces are topological
spaces, namely B is a topological category. Note that this taxonomy
of topological category is not standard in literature. Ours is consistent
with [7]. Natural object of interest in that case would be the category

eO(B) of (“open”) subcategories 1 of B. The question we may ask is,

then what should be a “natural framework for presheaves” in this con-
text. Of course, one may still work with the deﬁnition in (1.1). But,
more natural choice would be to consider the category Cat of small
categories as the codomain of a presheaf in this context, rather than
Set (or any other concrete category). Since Cat is not a concrete
category, we can not proceed with the deﬁnition of presheaf given in
(1.1) and we need a new framework. In this paper we propose such a
framework, and develop the corresponding theory of Cat-valued sieves
Let C be a category of a collection of small categories. We work with

a Cat-valued presheaf over C given by a contravariant functor:

(1.3)

R : Cop −→ Cat.

In particular, our future goal is to consider the case C = eO(PM), and

study the Grothendieck topologies [1, 2, 20] on the path space groupoid
PM of a given smooth manifold M; that is, a category PM, whose
object space is the manifold M and morphisms are certain equivalence
classes of smooth paths [5, 8, 9, 11, 24]. Usual compact-open topol-
ogy deﬁnes a topology on Mor(PM). The path space groupoid over a
smooth manifold plays a pivotal role in higher gauge theories [4, 16,
21–23]. The “locally deﬁned subcategories” of PM also appeared in
the context of local structures of categorical principal bundles [8, 12].

Notation. We work with following set of notation. For C and D, a
given pair of categories.

(1.4)

Fun(C, D)

will denote the set of all functors from C to D. For functors from C to
D,

1In this paper we will not discuss open subcategories. In [13] it has been deﬁned.

It would serve the purpose of this paper, if we simply think of eO(B) as a category

of subcategories of a given category B.

If θ1, θ2 : C

/ D are a pair of functors, then

(1.6)

Nat(θ1, θ2)

is the set of natural transformations between θ1 and θ2. We denote a
natural transformation Φ from a functor θ1 to another functor θ2 as

Let

(1.9)

Obj(cid:18)F (C, D)(cid:19) = Fun(C, D)
Mor(cid:18)F (C, D)(cid:19) = N (C, D).

Given a morphism f in some category, s(f ), t(f ) will respectively

denote the source of f and target of f ; that is,

s(f )

−→ t(f ).

∅ will be the empty category; i.e. a category whose object and mor-

phism sets are empty sets.

Summary of the paper. We start with a category of a collection of
small categories C. We show that there exists a (contravariant) functor
FU : Cop −→ Cat corresponding to each U ∈ Obj(C), analogous to a
Hom functor in set theoretic set-up. We show, in Proposition 2.2, that
functors FU “partially” fulﬁll Yoneda lemma.

We deﬁne a Cat-valued presheaf on C to be a contravariant functor

Cop −→ Cat.

In Theorem 3.2 we

show that classical Yoneda embedding is still valid in this framework;
that is, we can realize any category C as above, as a full subcategory
of category of its Cat-valued presheaves. We move onto deﬁne Cat-
valued sieves over C. In Example 3.2 we construct Cat-valued sieves
over the category O(B) (deﬁned in (2.2)).

2. Functors to Cat

Let C be a category of a collection of (small)categories; that is ob-
jects are a set of (small)categories and morphisms are functors between

is a given category and,

them. In particular, we will be interested in category eO(B), where B
Obj(cid:18)eO(B)(cid:19) := {U|U ⊂ B} = set of all subcategories of B,

Hom(U, V) = {Θ : U −→ V|U, V ⊂ B}.

(2.1)

We will also work with the category O(B), whose objects are same

as those of eO(B); but, only morphism between any two subcategories

(objects) is the inclusion functor, if one is subcategory of the other.
Otherwise no morphism exists:

Obj(cid:18)O(B)(cid:19) := {U|U ⊂ B} = set of all subcategories of B,

(2.2)

Hom(U, V) = {i : U ֒→ V|U ⊂ V ⊂ B},

where i is the inclusion functor, and

Hom(U, V) = ∅, if U 6⊂ V.

Let Cat be the category of all (small) categories. We deﬁne the
following contravariant functor, which will play the role of Hom-functor
in set theoretic framework. We deﬁne FU : Cop
/ Cat, corresponding
to each U ∈ Obj(C), to be

FU : Obj(C)

/ Obj(Cat)

(2.3)

V 7→ F (V, U)

FU : Mor(C)

/ Mor(Cat)

(cid:18)V

Θ

−→ W(cid:19) 7→(cid:18)F (W, U)

FU(Θ)

−−−−→ F (V, U)(cid:19),

(2.4)

where Θ is a functor from the category V to W. (2.4) deﬁnitely
requires an explanation. Let us verify that indeed we have such a
functor. Since Cat is the category of categories, (2.3) does make sense.
Now suppose V, W ∈ Obj(C), and we are given a functor

Θ : V

/ W.

Under the action of FU, V, W respectively mapped to the categories
F (V, U) and F (W, U). We have to show that Θ deﬁnes a functor

FU(Θ)

: F (W, U) −→ F (V, U),

FU(Θ) : Obj(cid:18)F (W, U)(cid:19) −→ Obj(cid:18)F (V, U)(cid:19),
FU(Θ) : Mor(cid:18)F (W, U)(cid:19) −→ Mor(cid:18)F (V, U)(cid:19),

Fun(W, U) −→ Fun(V, U)

N (W, U) −→ N (V, U).

For any Ψ ∈ Obj(cid:18)F (W, U)(cid:19) = Fun(W, U), by composition with
ΨΘ ∈ Fun(V, U) = Obj(cid:18)F (V, U)(cid:19). So, we have the map

the functor Θ : V

/ U; that is

(2.7)

FU(Θ) : Obj(cid:18)F (W, U)(cid:19) −→ Obj(cid:18)F (V, U)(cid:19),

Now considering above commutative diagram in the subcategory Image(Θ) ⊂

W, we have, for any ˜a

˜f
−→ ˜b ∈ Mor(V)

(2.9)

Ψ1(Θ(˜a))

Ψ1(Θ( ˜f ))

/ Ψ1(Θ(˜b))

S(Θ(˜a))

S(Θ(˜b))

Ψ2(Θ(˜a))

Ψ2(Θ( ˜f ))

/ Ψ2(Θ(˜b))

commutes. But according to (2.7),

FU(Θ)(Ψi) = ΨiΘ ∈ Fun(V, U),

i = 1, 2.

Thus commutative diagram (2.9) implies SΘ is a natural transforma-
tion between FU(Θ)(Ψ1) and FU(Θ)(Ψ2),

SΘ : FU(Θ)(Ψ1) =⇒ FU(Θ)(Ψ2).

We deﬁne

(2.10)

FU(Θ) : N (W, U) −→ N (V, U),

FU(Θ) : Mor(cid:18)F (W, U)(cid:19) −→ Mor(cid:18)F (V, U)(cid:19),
(cid:0)FU(Θ)(cid:1)(S) := SΘ ∈ N (V, U).
(cid:0)S2 ◦ S1(cid:1)(a) = S2(a) ◦ S1(a),

∀a ∈ Obj(W),

It follows from the composition of two natural transformations [19]:

that FU(Θ) is a functor. Thus, using (2.7) and (2.10), we obtain the
map:

(2.11)

FU : Mor(C)

/ Mor(Cat).

Combining (2.3) and (2.11) we produce our desired maps:

(2.12)

FU : Obj(C)
FU : Mor(C)

/ Obj(Cat),

/ Mor(Cat).

It is also obvious that FU is functorial. In summary, we have shown
that

Proposition 2.1. Let C be a category of a collection of (small)categories
and Cat be the category of all (small) categories. Then, for each
U ∈ Obj(C), we have a contravariant functor FU : Cop

In fact F(Θ), deﬁned as

(2.18)

(cid:18)F(Θ)(cid:19)(W) := F W(Θ),

is a natural transformation from FU to FV :

F(Θ) : FU =⇒ FV;

that is, following diagram commutes for all W, W′ ∈ Obj(C) and Φ ∈

Let us verify commutivity of the above diagram.

Lemma 2.1. Diagram in (2.19) commutes for all Φ ∈ Hom(W′, W) =
Fun(W′, W). That means, we have a natural transformation

given by (2.18).

F(Θ) : FU =⇒ FV,

Proof. We have to show that diagram commutes both at the level of
objects and morphisms.

First let us verify the commutivity for the objects.
Let Ψ ∈ Obj(FU(W)) = Fun(W, U). Then,

(2.20)

(cid:18)FU(Φ)(cid:19)(Ψ) = ΨΦ ∈ Fun(W′, U) = Obj(FU(W′)), [using(2.7)]
⇒(cid:18)F W′(cid:19)(ΨΦ) = ΘΨΦ ∈ Fun(W′, V) = Obj(FV(W′))[using(2.15)].

On the other hand,

(2.21)

(cid:18)F W(cid:19)(Ψ) = ΘΨ ∈ Fun(W, V) = Obj(FV(W)),
⇒(cid:18)FV(Φ)(cid:19)(ΘΨ) = ΘΨΦ ∈ Fun(W′, V) = Obj(FV(W′)).

(2.20), (2.21) imply that the diagram in (2.19) commutes at the level
of objects.

Now let us verify commutivity for the morphisms.

Let S ∈ Mor(FU(W)) = N (W, U). Then,

(2.22)

(cid:18)FU(Φ)(cid:19)(S) = SΦ ∈ N (W′, U) = Mor(FU(W′)), [using(2.10)]
⇒(cid:18)F W′(cid:19)(SΦ) = ΘSΦ ∈ N (W′, V) = Mor(FV(W′))[using(2.16)].

On the other hand,

(2.23)

⇒(cid:18)FV(Φ)(cid:19)(ΘS) = ΘSΦ ∈ N (W′, V) = Mor(FV(W′)),

(2.22), (2.23) imply that the diagram in (2.19) commutes also at the
level of morphisms.

(cid:3)

In other words, we have a set map:

(2.24)

F :Fun(U, V)

/ Nat(FU, FV)

Θ 7→ F (Θ).

We propose a version of Yoneda lemma in this context.

Proposition 2.2. There exists an isomorphism between Fun(U, V)
and Nat(FU, FV) :

(2.25)

Fun(U, V) ∼= Nat(FU, FV).

The set map F in (2.24) deﬁnes the corresponding bijection.

Proof. First we show the map is injective. Suppose for Θ1, Θ2 ∈
Fun(U, V), we have,

F(Θ1) = F (Θ2).

That means, for any W ∈ Obj(C),

(cid:18)F (Θ1)(cid:19)(W) =(cid:18)F (Θ2)(cid:19)(W),

⇒ F W(Θ1) = F W(Θ2),

and, by (2.15),

(2.26)

F W(Θ1), F W(Θ2) :Obj(cid:18)F (W, U)(cid:19)

/ Obj(cid:18)F (W, V)(cid:19),

SAIKAT CHATTERJEE

Putting W = U, in the above equation, we obtain,

F U(Θ1), F U(Θ2) : Fun(U, U)

/ Fun(U, V).

Thus

(cid:18)F U(Θ1)(cid:19)(IdU) =(cid:18)F U(Θ2)(cid:19)(IdU),

where IdU is the identity functor of U. Then the second equation of
(2.15) implies

We prove surjecitivity as follows.
Given any natural transformation

Θ1 = Θ2.

χ : FU =⇒ FV,
χ(W) : FU(W) =⇒ FV(W),
χ(W) : F (W, U) =⇒ F (W, V),

we have an element

Θ :=(cid:18)χ(U)(cid:19)(IdU) ∈ Obj(cid:18)F (U, V)(cid:19) = Fun(U, V),

which clearly maps to χ under the action of F .

(cid:3)

Example 2.1. Let us consider the case when C = O(B), where O(B)
is deﬁned in (2.2). Thus, if V is a subcategory of U, then F (V, U) is
an one object category. Otherwise it is an empty category:

(2.27)

V 6⊂ U

F (V, U) = ∅,

Obj(cid:18)F (V, U)(cid:19) = {i}, i : V ֒→ U
Mor(cid:18)F (V, U)(cid:19) = {S : i =⇒ i}

Then, it is easy to see that a morphism S ∈ Mor(cid:18)F (V, U)(cid:19) is given

by an element S(a) of Hom(a, a) for each a ∈ Obj(V),

such that for any a

S(b) ◦ f = f ◦ S(a).

Now suppose F (V′, U) = FU(V′) and F (V, U) = FU(V) are non
empty categories. Also, suppose Fun(V, V′) is non empty. That means
we have a ﬁltration of categories:

V ⊂ V′ ⊂ U.

Similarly, if F (V′, U′) = FU′(V′) and F (V, U′) = FU′(V) are non

V ⊂ V′ ⊂ U′.

3. Sieves of categories

Recall that the presheaf of sets, over a category C, is deﬁned as a

contravariant functor from C to Set

(3.1)

R : Cop

/ Set,

where Set is the category of (small) sets. For example the contravariant
Hom-functor

Hom(−, c) : Cop

/ Set,

corresponding to each c ∈ Obj(C), deﬁnes a Set valued presheaf. In-
stead of presheaves of sets, it is possible to introduce additional al-
gebraic structures into the picture. For instance, one may consider
presheaves of groups or rings respectively given by R : Cop
/ Grp
or R : Cop
/ Ring. Here Grp and Ring respectively denote (locally
small) category of (small) groups and (locally small) category of (small)
rings. In this section we will focus on the notion of sieves in the context
of the category Cat.

Let C be a category and c ∈ Obj(C). A sieve on c is a presheaf
Rc : Cop
/ Set such that Rc is a sub functor of the contravariant
Hom-functor Hom(−, c); that is, for all objects d ∈ Obj(C) and all
morphisms d

f−→ d′ ∈ Mor(C), Rc should satisfy

(3.2)

Rc(d) ⊂ Hom(d, c),

(cid:18)Rc(d′)

Rc(f )

−−−→ Rc(d)(cid:19) = Hom(f, c)|Rc(d′),

where Hom(f, c)|Rc(d′) denotes the restriction of Hom(f, c) : Hom(d′, c) →
Hom(d, c) to Rc(d′) ⊂ Hom(d′, c).

3.1. Presheaves of categories. As before, let C be a category of a
collection of (small) categories, and Cat be the category of all small
categories. Existence of the functor

FU : Cop

/ Cat,

for each U ∈ Obj(C) [Proposition 2.1], motivates following deﬁnition
of presheaves of categories.

CATEGORIFIED PRESHEAVES AND SIEVES

13

Let C be a category of a collection of (small) categories, and Cat
be the category of all small categories. A presheaf of categories (or, a
Cat-valued presheaf ), over the category C, is a functor

(3.3)

R : Cop

/ Cat.

It is immediate from the deﬁnition above and Proposition 2.1 that:

Corollary 3.1. For each U ∈ Obj(C), the functor

FU : Cop

/ Cat,

in Proposition 2.1 is a presheaf of categories, over the category C.

Let Prsh(C, Cat) := F (Cop, Cat) denote the category of Cat-valued

presheaves, over the category C; that is,

(3.4)

Obj(cid:18)Prsh(C, Cat)(cid:19) = Fun(Cop, Cat),
Mor(cid:18)Prsh(C, Cat)(cid:19) = N (Cop, Cat).

Then by Corollary 3.1 we have a functor, from the category C to the

category Prsh(C, Cat), given by

C −→ Prsh(C, Cat),

U 7→ FU,

Obj(cid:18)C(cid:19) −→ Obj(cid:18)Prsh(C, Cat)(cid:19)
Mor(cid:18)C(cid:19) −→ Mor(cid:18)Prsh(C, Cat)(cid:19),
(cid:18)U
−→ V(cid:19) 7→(cid:18)F (Θ) : FU =⇒ FV(cid:19), [given by(2.24)].

Θ

(3.5)

(3.6)

But according to Proposition 2.2, the above functor C −→ Prsh(C, Cat)

is full and faithful. This allows us to identify C as a full subcategory
of Prsh(C, Cat).

Theorem 3.2. Let C be a category of a collection of (small) categories,
and Cat be the category of all small categories. Let Prsh(C, Cat) :=
F (Cop, Cat) be the category of Cat-valued presheaves over the category
C. Then there exists a full and faithful functor

SAIKAT CHATTERJEE

Instead of working with the entire category Cat, one can consider
a presheaf of categories with some additional structures. For example,
one may deﬁne a presheaf of categorical groups [3, 10, 14, 18], over C,
to be a contravariant functor from C to CatGrp :

R : Cop

/ CatGrp,

where CatGrp is the category of categorical groups. We will denote
category of presheaves of categorical groups by

Prsh(C, CatGrp).

In [13] we construct such an example of presheaf of categorical groups.
In this paper our main objective is to introduce the notion of sieves of
categories. So we will work with the deﬁnition of presheaf of categories
given in (3.3).

Let C be a category of a collection of (small) categories, and Cat
be the category of all small categories. Let U ∈ Obj(C). A sieve of
categories (or, a Cat-valued sieve) on U is a presheaf of categories

RU : Cop

/ Cat,

such that RU is a subfunctor of FU. That is, for any V ∈ Obj(C), and

(cid:18)V

Θ

−→ V′(cid:19) ∈ Mor(C), we should have

(3.7)

(3.8)

RU(V) a subcategory of F (V, U); RU(V) ⊂ F (V, U),

(cid:18)RU(V′)

RU(Θ)

−−−−→ RU(V)(cid:19) = FU(Θ)|RU(V′),

where FU(Θ)|RU(V′) denotes the restriction of the functor FU(Θ) :
F (V′, U) → F (V, U) to the subcategory RU(V′) ⊂ F (V′, U).

Equivalently one can think of a Cat-valued sieve RU as a collection
of morphisms (functors) with common codomain U in category C; that
is, a collection of functors from objects (categories) in C to U, and a
collection of natural transformations between these functors, such that
following conditions are satisﬁed:

(1) If the functor V

V ∈ Mor(C), V′ ΘΨ

Θ

−→ U is in RU, then for any functor V′ Ψ
−→
−−→ U is also in RU.

(2) If the natural transformation S : Θ1 =⇒ Θ2 is in RU, then for
−→ V ∈ Mor(C), SΨ : Θ1Ψ =⇒ Θ2Ψ is also in

any functor V′ Ψ
RU.

Example 3.1. We call a category A trivially discrete, if objects form
a set, and only morphisms in Mor(A) are identity morphisms:

Mor(A) = {1a|a ∈ Obj(A)} ≃ Obj(A).

CATEGORIFIED PRESHEAVES AND SIEVES

15

Suppose Cdis is a category, whose objects are trivially discrete cat-
egories. Then a Cat-valued sieve over Cdis is simply a sieve in the
traditional sense.

Example 3.2. Let us again consider the case C = O(B). We re-
fer to Example 2.1 for the description of the functors FU. Let U ∈

Obj(cid:18)O(B)(cid:19), and RU be the selection of

(1) subcategories of U, which are stable under inclusion functors;

that is, if RU selects Vk, · · · , V1 ⊂ U, then

Vk ⊂ Vk−1 ⊂ · · · · · · ⊂ V2 ⊂ V1 ⊂ V0 = U,

Vk

ik
֒→ Vk−1

ik−1
֒→ · · · · · ·

i3
֒→ V2

i2
֒→ V1

i1
֒→ V0 = U,

(2) a subcategory Cj of F (Vj, U), for each j, 0 ≤ j ≤ k; (we set
i0 = IdU) that is, a choice of a submonoid Mj of Nat(i0 ◦ · · · ◦
ij, i0 ◦ · · · ◦ ij) [see Example 2.1 for an explicit description of
these natural transformations]:

Obj(Cj) = {i0 ◦ · · · ◦ ij}
Mor(Cj) = Mj ⊂ Nat(i0 ◦ · · · ◦ ij, i0 ◦ · · · ◦ ij),

0 ≤ j ≤ k

such that

Mj ⊂ i∗

jMj−1,

1 ≤ j ≤ k,

where i∗

jMj−1 := {Sij|S ∈ Mj−1}.

Then RU deﬁnes a Cat-valued sieve over U ∈ Obj(cid:18)O(B)(cid:19) as follows.

RU(Vj) = Cj,

(cid:18)RU(is+1 ◦ · · · ◦ ir)(cid:19)(S) = Sis+1 ◦ · · · ◦ ir ∈ Mor(Cr),

where r ≥ s, hence is+1 ◦ · · · ◦ ir : Vr֒→Vs, and S ∈ Mor(Cs).

In fact, every Cat-valued sieve over O(B) arises in this fashion.

Concluding remarks

In this paper we have developed a framework of Cat-valued presheaves
and sieves over a category of (small) categories C. In [13] we have used
some of the constructions and results of this paper to explore Cat-

topological groupoid B.

valued sheaves over the category eO(B) of “open subcategories” of a

Natural direction of enquiry following Cat-valued sieves should be
towards Grothendieck topologies on a topological category. A paper

16

SAIKAT CHATTERJEE

(jointly with, A Lahiri, A N Sengupta) is under preparation on this
topic.

Lastly, we are obliged to point out that Cat is a 2-category [18], and

so is C or eO(B). It would have done justice to the natural higher struc-

tures involved, if we had also incorporated them into our framework
and deﬁned the Cat-valued presheaf to be a 2-functor

Cop −→ Cat.

For the sake of simplicity, we have treated Cat, C, eO(B) as 1-categories,

completely ignoring the higher structures. However, without much
diﬃculty the framework in this paper extends to higher morphisms as
well .
