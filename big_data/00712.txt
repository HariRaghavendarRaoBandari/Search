Abstract

We argue that the event horizon of a binary black hole merger, in the extreme-mass-ratio
limit where one of the black holes is much smaller than the other, can be described in an
exact analytic way. This is done by tracing in the Schwarzschild geometry a congruence
of null geodesics that approaches a null plane at inﬁnity. Its form can be given explicitly
in terms of elliptic functions, and we use it to analyze and illustrate the time-evolution of
the horizon along the merger. We identify features such as the line of caustics at which
light rays enter the horizon, and the critical point at which the horizons touch. We also
compute several quantities that characterize these aspects of the merger.

Introduction

Black hole mergers occur in Nature [1]. In the theory of General Relativity they are entirely
described by the vacuum equations Rµν = 0, but extracting the details of the fusion of
the two horizons requires in general heavy computational resources. Nevertheless, we will
show that there is one instance in which the event horizon of the merger becomes so simple
that it can be described in an exact analytic way. This is the extreme-mass-ratio (EMR)
limit in which one of the black holes is much smaller than the other. If m and M are the
two black hole masses, or equivalently their characteristic sizes (in units G = c = 1), then
the EMR limit is m/M → 0.

This limit is often taken as one where the size of the large black hole, M , is ﬁxed
while the small black hole is regarded as a point-like object of size m → 0. Although this
viewpoint is appropriate for extracting the gravitational waves emitted in the collision
(with wavelengths that grow with M ), it erases the details of phenomena that happen on
the scale of m, such as the evolution of the event horizon as the two black holes fuse with
each other. In order to resolve these smaller length scales, we must take the EMR limit
keeping m ﬁxed while M → ∞.1

The techniques and ideas that we need for describing this process are elementary.
Consider the last moments before the merger, when the small black hole is at a distance
(cid:28) M of the large one. The equivalence principle asserts that we can always place ourselves
in the rest frame of the small black hole, and that the curvature of the large black hole
can be neglected over distances (cid:28) M . Then the spacetime around the small black hole
should be well approximated by the Schwarzschild geometry [3]. Although the curvature
created by the large black hole vanishes in this limit, its horizon is still present: it becomes
an inﬁnite, Rindler-type, acceleration horizon. More precisely, it is a congruence of light
rays that reach asymptotic null inﬁnity as a planar null surface. We conclude that in
the EMR limit, on scales much smaller than M , the event horizon of the black hole
merger can be found by tracing an appropriate family of light rays in the Schwarzschild
geometry; speciﬁcally, a congruence of null geodesics that approach a planar horizon at a
large distance from the small black hole.

We will construct this event horizon explicitly, and show that it does indeed exhibit
the behavior expected of the merger: at early times, spatial sections of the event horizon
consist of two components, one of them an almost spherical small black hole, and the
other an almost planar large black hole. The two horizons deform each other through their
gravitational attraction, and develop conical shapes along a line of caustics where light
rays enter the horizon before the merger. When the black holes merge, they form a single
smooth surface that then relaxes down to a planar horizon at late times. We illustrate

1These two views of the EMR limit are the leading-order approximations in a matched asymptotic
expansion between the near-zone, with radii r (cid:28) M , and the far-zone, with r (cid:29) m, which can be matched
in the overlap-zone m (cid:28) r (cid:28) M [2]. We return to this issue in the conclusions.

this with pictures drawn using our exact results. We also compute several parameters that
characterize the merger — they are solutions of transcendental equations, so we obtain
them numerically.

In our analysis the small black hole plunges head-on into the large one, but it is easy
to show that if there is a relative velocity between the two black holes, e.g., the small black
hole moves in a direction parallel to the large horizon, the situation is equivalent to our
construction up to a rotation.

While we are not aware that this analysis of the horizon of EMR mergers has been done
before, related ideas have been employed in recent years. Refs. [4, 5, 6, 7] apply the idea
that the event horizon for the fall of any gravitating object into an acceleration horizon is
obtained by appropriate light-ray-tracing in the spacetime of that object. Ref. [8] studies
the event horizon of the same EMR merger as we do, but it focuses on scales ∼ M and
therefore misses the structure of the merger that we observe. A diﬀerent study of an exact
merger, focusing on two equal-mass charged black holes in the Kastor-Traschen solution
in deSitter space [9], reaches some conclusions that agree with ours and are presumably
generic [10].

Finally, since we have the exact geometry for the merger — i.e., the Schwarzschild
metric — it is also possible to study the evolution of its apparent horizon. We leave this
for a forthcoming article [11].

2 Deﬁning the Event Horizon
As we explained above, the exact geometry for the merger in the limit m/M → 0 is
the Schwarzschild solution with mass m. We seek the event horizon as a particular null
hypersurface in this geometry. Conventionally, the Schwarzschild solution has an event
horizon at r = 2m, which is a cylindrical null hypersurface that reaches I + at inﬁnite
retarded time. However, we are interested instead in a diﬀerent null hypersurface, namely
one that reaches I + at a ﬁnite retarded time with the geometry of a null plane, like an
acceleration horizon would do. This acceleration horizon is the limiting form of the event
horizon of the large black hole when M → ∞.

So we begin with the Schwarzschild black hole, in D = n + 3 dimensions,

This geometry has a timelike Killing vector ∂t, which deﬁnes the rest frame of the
small black hole, and an exact SO(n + 2) rotational symmetry. Both isometries are only
approximate when the ratio m/M is ﬁnite, and would be broken by corrections in an
expansion in m/M . But the exact symmetry in the limit m/M → 0 is crucial for our
analysis.

dλ

= ( ˙t, ˙r, ˙φ1, . . . , ˙φn+1) ,

(2.2)

with P 2 = 0 and λ an aﬃne parameter along the geodesics. The event horizon of the
collision has SO(n + 1) symmetry along the axis that joins the two black holes,2 so we
need only consider one angle of Sn+1, call it φ. Speciﬁcally, we write

dΩ(n+1) = dθ2 + sin2 θ dφ2 + cos2 θ dΩ(n−1) ,

(2.3)

and study geodesics on the plane θ = π/2. We put the collision axis along the two segments
φ = 0, π. Before the merger, φ = 0 points away from the large black hole and φ = π points
towards it.

The Killing vectors ∂t and ∂φ of the geometry imply two integrals of motion, and the

equations to solve are

where q is the impact parameter, i.e., the ratio between the conserved angular momentum
and the energy of the light-ray trajectory.

It will be convenient to use r instead of λ as the (non-aﬃne) parameter along the
geodesics. This is because the integration of (2.6) gives λ(r) as a combination of elliptic
integrals of diﬀerent kinds, which we cannot invert analytically to ﬁnd r(λ) and then
obtain t(λ) and φ(λ). Instead, we get the geodesics as

The section of the event horizon in the space (t, φ, r) is a two-dimensional surface,
i.e., a one-parameter family of geodesics. The entire (n + 2)-dimensional event horizon is
obtained by rotating through an angle π around the collision axis, and acting with the
group SO(n) to generate the Ω(n−1) factor of the geometry.

The integration constants in (2.7) are ﬁxed by the requirement that the null surface
becomes a planar horizon at inﬁnity. The geodesics on this event horizon will be labeled
by q. Let us ﬁrst ﬁx the integration constant for φq. We have

integration constants to the values (2.9) and (2.16). We have performed ﬁrst the indeﬁnite
integrals using Mathematica, which makes speciﬁc q-dependent choices for the integration
constants that we must extract and then subtract. The procedure is cumbersome but
straightforward. Figure 2 shows the hypersurface generated by these geodesics.

In ﬁgure 3 we show a sequence of constant-time slices of this event horizon. They

area-radius
of the duration of the fusion (3.9). New null generators enter the two components of the horizon
at all t ∈ (−∞, t∗], creating cones at the caustic points. The full two-dimensional constant-time
slices of the event horizon are obtained by rotating around x = 0. Axis units are r0 = 1.

they approach each other, and eventually merge into a single horizon, which then relaxes
into a ﬂat surface. We do not have explicit analytic expressions for these constant-t slices.
These require inverting the function tq(r) to ﬁnd rq(t), which we have not managed to do
except in the limit r (cid:29) r0, to be discussed in sec. 3.2. The plots in ﬁg. 3 have been drawn
by taking constant-t cuts of plots generated with a suﬃciently dense number of geodesics.
We often use the spatial coordinates x and z introduced in (2.10). Although these are
not convenient for writing the metric at ﬁnite r, they provide an easy way of representing
the information in the plane of polar coordinates (r, φ).

3.1 Structure of the event horizon and parameters of the merger

Fig. 2 exhibits clearly the presence before the merger of a line of caustics (also known as
a crease set), where light rays intersect. At these points, null generators enter to be part
of the event horizon. In the full three-dimensional event horizon all the generators that
intersect lie on a S1 of radius q at future inﬁnity.3 The presence of caustics is generic in
the event horizons of black hole mergers. In our hypersurface the caustic line extends to
past inﬁnity.

There are two special values of the impact parameter, qc and q∗, with qc < q∗, which

separate the generators into diﬀerent classes.

Non-caustic generators. The light rays at q = qc separate the generators with q > qc
that enter the horizon at a caustic at ﬁnite time, from those with q < qc that extend back
to inﬁnitely early times (see ﬁg. 4). The latter asymptote in the past to the generators of
the Schwarzschild horizon at r = r0. In particular, the critical value q = qc corresponds
to the rays that start at r = r0 at φ = π, and therefore are determined by the equation

We can solve this numerically to obtain4

φqc(r0) = π .

qc = 2.22864 r0 .

(3.3)

(3.4)

The generators with q ≤ qc form at future inﬁnity a disk of radius qc and area πq2
c . Their
initial area at past inﬁnity is the area of the Schwarzschild black hole, Ain = 4πr2
0. Thus
in the evolution of this part of the event horizon, to which no new generators are added,
the area increases by

(3.5)

3It may be more appropriate to refer to the intersection as a focus rather than a caustic, but the latter

terminology is rather common.

4This and subsequent numerical solutions of transcendental equations are obtained using Mathematica’s

FindRoot, which gives better precision than we are showing.

Figure 4: Event horizon of the merger in four dimensions. Non-caustic geodesics are the green
curves, which emanate from the Schwarzschild horizon in the inﬁnite past. Caustic geodesics are
shown in black. They enter the hypersurface through the caustic line (red thick curve). The black
dashed curves are the geodesics with q = qc that separate the two classes.

Caustic generators. All generators with qc < q < ∞ enter the horizon at a caustic at
ﬁnite time. Among them, we single out those with q = q∗ which are the last to enter the
horizon as measured in Killing time t. Generators with q > q∗ enter the horizon on the
side of the large black hole, and generators with qc < q < q∗ enter on the side of the small
black hole. This is illustrated in ﬁg. 5.

The rays with q = q∗ enter at time t = t∗ and radius r = r∗. These are the parameters
that characterize the pinch-on instant at which the two horizons touch and merge to form
a single one. In order to determine these parameters, follow the rays with q = q∗ back in
time from I +. At the caustic on the collision axis φ = π, where they leave the horizon
towards the past, they neither approach the small black hole nor escape from it, that is,
˙r|φ=π = 0. Then (2.6) implies that q∗ and r∗ are obtained by solving the equations

r3∗ − q2∗r∗ + q2∗r0 = 0 ,

φq∗(r∗) = π ,

Figure 5: Projection of the hypersurface in the (x, z) plane. All rays propagate towards z → +∞.
Green curves are non-caustic generators. The black dashed curves with q = qc separate them from
caustic generators. The dotted purple curves with q = q∗ separate the generators that enter the
horizon on the side of the small black hole, qc < q < q∗ from those that enter on the side of the
large black hole, q > q∗. The latter rays ﬁrst approach the small black hole, reach a minimum
distance rmin (red dots), and then move away from it. For q = q∗, the minimum rmin lies at the
caustic. Rays with qc < q < q∗ move away from the small black hole at all times after they enter
the event horizon.

where r∗ is the largest root of the cubic polynomial.5 We ﬁnd

q∗ = 2.67848 r0 ,

r∗ = 1.76031 r0.

(3.7)

r∗ can be taken as a measure of how strongly the small black hole is distorted, or pulled
at the cusp, from the initial sphere of radius r0.

Inserting these values in the solution for tq(r) we obtain

t∗ = −4.46048 r0 .

(3.8)

Note that t∗ is determined only with reference to the choice (2.16) that ﬁxes the origin
of retarded time. We may also consider the diﬀerence ∆∗ between the retarded time at
I + of the event horizon (in the direction φ = 0), and the retarded time of the light ray
emitted at the pinch-on instant in the opposite direction φ = π — i.e., towards the large
black hole. This is

∆∗ = r∗ + r0 ln((r∗ − r0)/r0) − t∗ = 5.94676 r0 .

(3.9)

Fig. 6 illustrates it in a conformal diagram for the causal structure of the merger geometry
(i.e., the Schwarzschild spacetime) along the collision axis.

5For q < qph = (3

√
3/2)r0 there are no real positive roots. qph corresponds to the unstable circular

photon orbit at rph = 3r0/2, which does not appear to play any special role in this construction.

Figure 6: Conformal diagram for the geometry along the collision axis φ = 0, π. The green light
ray is the central event horizon generator (2.17) with q = 0, which moves along φ = 0. The
solid-red spacelike curve is the line of caustics, which extends along φ = π. The dashed-red line is
a light ray that emerges from the pinch-on point at r = r∗, t = t∗, towards I + on φ = π. This ray
propagates inside the large black hole. The retarded-time diﬀerence ∆∗ characterizes the duration
of the merger.

Note that the dashed-red light ray propagates inside the large black hole, so the
retarded-time diﬀerence ∆∗ is not measurable by observers outside it. ∆∗ also admits
an interpretation that does not involve any propagation through the large black hole in-
terior: it is the time elapsed from t∗ until the moment when the central generator (2.17)
reaches r = r∗ along the antipodal direction φ = 0, i.e., until the instant at which the
green ray intersects the line r = r∗ in ﬁg. 6. By this time, the two horizons have noticeably
fused with each other (see ﬁg. 3). Through either interpretation, ∆∗ can be regarded as
characterizing the duration of the merger.

We can also quantify the growth in the area of the small black hole, now taking into

account the addition of generators to the small horizon at caustics. This is

(3.10)

The diﬀerence between (3.10) and (3.5) is attributed to the generators with qc < q < q∗
that are added, and to their subsequent expansion until they reach I +.

It is unclear to us whether there is any useful way to quantify the total growth of the
large horizon in the merger, since it is an inﬁnite horizon where all the generators with
qc < q < ∞ have entered at caustics at a ﬁnite time in the past.

We can obtain the equation for the caustics in explicit form. In order to ﬁnd the radial

position rcaustic(q) we have to solve

The rays qc < q < q∗ that enter at the small horizon at radius r = rcaustic, afterwards
move away from the small black hole in trajectories with ˙r > 0. In contrast, the generators
with q > q∗ that enter at the large horizon, ﬁrst approach the small black hole, then reach
a minimum distance of it, r = rmin, and afterwards escape away towards inﬁnity. This
minimum radius is the largest root of r3 − q2r + q2r0 that is also smaller than rcaustic, and
we show it for some geodesics in ﬁg. 4.

These considerations imply that we must be careful when computing the generators
with q > q∗. Since we are parametrizing the geodesics using r, their trajectories must be
given as two branches of solutions,

3.2 Perturbative solution at r (cid:29) r0

The integrals (3.1), (3.2) simplify considerably if we evaluate them in an expansion in
r0/r (cid:28) 1. In this limit the small black hole appears as a point particle, so we miss the
structure of the event horizon around the region r ∼ r0 where the merger takes place. On
the other hand, this limit allows us to ﬁnd much more easily the geometry of the horizon
at large distances of the small black hole.

In fact, we can obtain explicit analytic expressions for constant-time sections of the
event horizon, which we could not do in the exact solution. For this purpose it is convenient
to give the event horizon as a surface parametrized by t and q. To ﬁrst order in r0, and
after ﬁxing the integration constant (2.16) we can invert tq(r) to ﬁnd

and the spatial sections do not become ﬂat (i.e., z (cid:39) t) at large |x|, but have z ∼ − ln|x|
instead. In fact the same phenomenon happens for t, z (cid:29) r0 if we consider exponentially
large |x| ∼ r0et/r0.

This distortion from the planar shape is an eﬀect of the long range of the gravitational
ﬁeld of the small black hole in four dimensions. In a merger of black holes with small but
ﬁnite mass ratio m/M , the radius of the large black hole acts as a long-distance cut-oﬀ
on the coordinate x along the horizon. The results above mean that around the moment
when the small black hole falls into the large one, it creates a big distortion ∼ m ln(M/m)
at distances (cid:29) m on the horizon of the latter, which does not dissipate until late times
t (cid:29) m ln(M/m).

Early times −t,−z (cid:29) r0, including the caustic line. Here eqs. (3.18) apply at all
x and in particular around the caustic line on the large horizon at x = 0. Then we can
we study the properties of the caustic cones at early times. Assuming that the generators
that reach the axis φ = π at this time have q (cid:28) |t| we can expand

so near the axis x = 0 we ﬁnd, consistently, q (cid:39) (cid:112)2r0|t| (cid:28) |t|. Note that in z(q, t) we

have included a term of order r2
the same order as the others (corrections to z(q, t) at order r3
near the caustic). Then, the caustic cone at the axis has slope

This result is in precise agreement with the value that [8] calculated keeping the large
black hole size ﬁxed and expanding in the small black hole size r0.6

The caustic line at early times is the spacelike curve −t = r + O(r0). Its line element

is

which is in parametric agreement with the calculation in [8].

The perturbative solution at order r2

0 (appendix B) reproduces very well the exact
shape of the event horizon outside of a region of size ≈ ∆∗ around the merger where the
evolution is very non-linear. Fig. 7 exhibits this agreement.

It may be interesting to study the properties of the caustic line along the small black

hole horizon. However, this requires a diﬀerent approach and we have not pursued it.

is not more complicated than the four-dimensional case. Once again the solution is ex-
pressed in terms of elliptic integrals of diﬀerent kinds, which we give in appendix A.

We show the D = 5 hypersurface in ﬁgure 8. It is very similar to the four-dimensional
one, but now the event horizon at late time approaches a planar horizon more quickly, as
we will see below.

6Ref. [8] in eq. (120) gives the cone angle α as a function of the (large black hole) retarded time v
and the small black hole mass µ. The result at v → 0 agrees with ours at large −t, once we identify
2α (cid:39) dz/dx|cone, v (cid:39) −t and µ = r0/2.

Again, we have the same three types of null geodesics on the event horizon, and the

values of q that delimit them are

qc = 1.88698r0,

q∗ = 2.00900r0 .

The pinch-on radius and times are

All these parameters are smaller than in four dimensions, which reﬂects the fact that
as D grows larger the gravitational potential is concentrated closer to the small black hole,
and the merger proceeds more swiftly.

The fact that (4.7) is larger than in four dimensions is due to the larger number of directions
in which the generators can expand. In contrast, the total increase in the area of the small
black hole (4.8) is less than in four dimensions, indicating that less generators are added
to the horizon through the milder caustic. This conforms to the general idea that black
hole mergers are less irreversible (produce less entropy) as the number of dimensions grows
larger.

so the cone is less pointed for larger n. The line element along the caustic line, dsc (cid:39)
(r0/r)n/2dr is such that when n > 2 the total length is ﬁnite, even if the line extends to
the inﬁnite past. This is because the caustic line approaches much more quickly a null
curve, which does not add to the total proper length.

,

Again, we interpret these results as consequences of the stronger localization of the
gravitational ﬁeld as n increases, which yields a very mild caustic singularity on the horizon
at r (cid:29) r0.

5 Throat swelling

Black hole fusion begins at the moment when the cones on the event horizon close oﬀ,
develop into cusps at t = t∗, and then form a thin throat that connects the two horizons.
We can expect that the geometry of the event horizon exhibits critical behavior in the
instants before and after pinch-on. Since in this regime we do not have explicit solutions
for the constant-time sections of the event horizon, we study it through slices such as those
used to produce the plots in ﬁg. 3.

Right before the merger, when the caustic cone on the large horizon closes oﬀ as t → t∗,

we expect that

dz
dx

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)cone

∼ −(t∗ − t)−γ .

(5.1)

We ﬁnd γ = 1/2 up to a few percent, both in D = 4 and D = 5. This suggests that it may
be the same in other dimensions. It may be interesting to verify this, and also to investigate
whether this exponent is universal, e.g., when charge or rotation are introduced. Being a
short-distance eﬀect, the same critical behavior could be present in the small black hole
horizon, but this remains to be studied.

We can also examine the growth of the thin throat connecting the two horizons imme-
diately after its formation at pinch-on time t∗. We have managed to accurately measure
the half-width ρ of the throat, i.e., its extent along the semi-axis x > 0. We ﬁnd that, for
times shortly after t∗, the throat grows linearly

(0.730 ± 0.005)(t − t∗) ,

ρ =

(D = 4)

(D = 5)

(5.2)

(see ﬁgure 9). This linear growth lasts until ρ/r0 (cid:39) 0.25, and then begins to slow down.
The linear behavior (5.2) agrees with the results in [10], which studied a merger in
the Kastor-Traschen solution of four-dimensional charged black holes in deSitter [9]. As

Figure 9: Plots of the throat thickness vs time, in units r0 = 1. The blue curve is a linear ﬁt
to the ﬁrst 20 points with t − t∗ ∈ (0.01, 0.2). The inset is a magniﬁcation close to the pinch-on,
where the throat grows linearly with t.

ref. [10] observed, the linear growth may be expected since after the merger the surface is
smooth. So we expect this to be a general feature of black hole mergers.

In the example in [10] the behavior (5.2) was followed after a time by exponential
growth, presumably due to the deSitter expansion. Instead, in our setup the growth slows
down.

6 Mergers with relative velocities

We have described a merger in which an inﬁnitely large black hole approaches along the
z direction a ﬁnite-size black hole that is at rest. The asymptotic surface dt = dz from
which the event horizon is traced back is invariant under boosts in z, so the event horizon
would be the same if there were any velocity along the collision axis.

We may also consider situations where the black holes have a relative velocity along
a direction parallel to the large horizon — this includes in particular the possibility of
a large rotating black hole and a small black hole on a trajectory not co-rotating with
it. The generic arguments in the introduction indicate that in the EMR limit this event
horizon should be equivalent to the one for radial plunge, but it may be worth elaborating
the case.

Let us focus on the form of the event horizon in the asymptotic future, where we
impose the initial (actually ﬁnal) conditions that determine the null congruence. We have
been considering that this horizon does not move, relative to the small black hole, along
its planar directions, so asymptotically the surface is given by

If instead the large horizon moves along the x direction, we can obtain its asymptotic form

dt = dz .

t = ¯t cosh η − ¯x sinh η,
x = ¯x cosh η − ¯t sinh η,

(6.2)

(6.3)

and z = ¯z. That is, if now ¯t is the time in the rest frame of the small black hole, the event
horizon is a null congruence in the Schwarzschild geometry that asymptotes to

d¯t =

d¯z

cosh η

+ tanh η d¯x .

(6.4)

However, this surface can also be obtained from (6.1) by performing a rotation in the (x, z)
plane

and t = ¯t, so that

z = ¯z cos α + ¯x sin α,
x = ¯x cos α − ¯z sin α ,

d¯t = cos α d¯z + sin α d¯x.

We just need to choose the rotation angle to be

sin α = tanh η.

(6.5)

(6.6)

(6.7)

(6.8)

Thus the eﬀect of a boost in a direction parallel to the large horizon is equivalent to a
rotation in the plane formed by this direction and the collision axis. We do not need to
compute again the null generators, since it suﬃces to set the q-independent integration
constant α in (2.9) to the value (6.8).

7 Concluding remarks

Everything we have needed to obtain the event horizon has been in place for a long time:
the technical ingredients are the Schwarzschild solution and its null geodesics, known 100
years ago. The concepts involved are also venerably old — the equivalence principle, which
predates General Relativity itself, and the notion of event horizon, well understood more
than 50 years ago.

The construction can be extended to EMR mergers with small black holes other than
Schwarzschild. When the small black hole is asymptotically ﬂat and spherically symmetric,
like the Reissner-Nordstrom solution, the extension is straightforward, up to the explicit
quadratures for tq(r) and φq(r). Of more direct physical interest is the EMR merger with a
small Kerr black hole. The lower degree of symmetry makes the problem computationally
quite harder, but still much simpler than when m/M is ﬁnite, since we know the exact
geometry in which the event horizon must be found. The class of large black holes that can
be covered is also very wide, since the geometry near a non-degenerate horizon is always
Rindler space.

18

Gravitational wave emission is conspicuously absent from our description of the merger.
In the limit M → ∞ the radiation zone is pushed inﬁnitely far away, and the geometry
acquires an exact time-translation isometry, so there cannot be any waves. Thus the price
to pay for capturing exactly the event horizon is that the main observational signature of a
black hole merger is removed from the picture. What is, then, the utility of this analysis?
First of all, and leaving aside the diﬃculties (even of principle) of directly observing
the structure of the event horizon at very short scales, we believe that it is useful to
have as simple an understanding as possible of a basic phenomenon in General Relativity
— which furthermore can be a good approximation to events that possibly take place
in Nature: given the ﬁndings of [1], it does not seem impossible that black hole binary
mergers with mass ratios (cid:46) 1/30 could be detected in ground-based observatories, even
more so in space-based ones. Our construction and characterization of the event horizon
can be used as a benchmark for detailed numerical calculations that attempt to capture
all the features of the phenomenon down to scales ∼ m.

Second, our study gives the near-zone solution of the merger to leading order in m/M .
One can then match it to the far-zone construction of the EMR event horizon in [8],
to obtain the ﬁrst-order corrections in m/M . This will make the curvature of the large
black hole visible in the near-zone, as well as the eﬀects of gravitational waves on it.
Corrections computed in the near-zone then provide the boundary conditions for the next-
order calculation in the far zone, and so on, iteratively in a matched asymptotic expansion.
It is not inconceivable that the sensitivity of future detectors will require such higher-order
calculations. Our work is only the ﬁrst step in the description of their event horizons.
