ABSTRACT

Aims. We examined the velocity, density and temperature structure of Taurus Molecular Cloud-1 (TMC-1), a ﬁlamentary cloud in a
nearby quiescent star forming area, to understand its morphology and evolution.
Methods. We observed high S/N, high velocity resolution NH3(1,1) and (2,2) emission on an extended map. By ﬁtting multiple
hyperﬁne-split line proﬁles to the NH3(1,1) spectra we derived the velocity distribution of the line components and calculated gas
parameters on several positions. Herschel SPIRE far-infrared continuum observations were reduced and used to calculate the physical
parameters of the Planck Galactic Cold Clumps (PGCCs) in the region, including the two in TMC-1. The morphology of TMC-1 was
investigated with several types of clustering methods in the position-velocity-column density parameter space.
Results. Our Herschel-based column density map shows a main ridge with two local maxima and a separated peak to the south-west.
H2-column densities and dust colour temperatures are in the range of 0.5-3.3 × 1022 cm−2 and 10.5-12 K, respectively. NH3-column
densities and H2-volume densities are in the range of 2.8-14.2 × 1014 cm−2 and 0.4-2.8 × 104 cm−3. Kinetic temperatures are typically
very low with a minimum of 9 K at the maximum NH3 and H2-column density region. The kinetic temperature maximum was found at
the protostar IRAS 04381+2540 with a value of 13.7 K. The kinetic temperatures vary similarly as the colour temperatures in spite of
the fact that densities are lower than the critical density for coupling between the gas and dust phase. The k-means clustering method
separated four sub-ﬁlaments in TMC-1 with masses of 32.5, 19.6, 28.9 and 45.9 M
and low turbulent velocity dispersion in the range
⊙
of 0.13-0.2 kms−1.
Conclusions. The main ridge of TMC-1 is composed of four sub-ﬁlaments that are close to gravitational equilibrium. We label them
TMC-1F1 through F4. TMC-1F1, TMC-1F2 and TMC-1F4 are very elongated, dense and cold. TMC-1F3 is a little less elongated and
somewhat warmer, probably heated by the Class I protostar, IRAS 04381+2540 that is embedded in it. TMC-1F3 is approximately
0.1 pc behind TMC1-F1. Because of its structure, TMC-1 is a good target to test ﬁlament evolution scenarios.

1. Introduction

Large-scale ﬁlaments have long been recognized as fundamen-
tal environments of the star forming process. Several studies re-
vealed that ﬁlaments are common structures in interstellar clouds
with young stars in diﬀerent stages of formation located in them
(Schneider & Elmegreen 1979; Bally et al. 1987; Hatchell et al.
2005; Goldsmith et al. 2008). Recent results based on Herschel
FIR observations of nearby star forming regions directed the at-
tention again to the connection between ﬁlaments, dense cores
and stars (see e.g. André et al. 2010). Since star formation oc-
curs mostly in prominent ﬁlaments, characterizing the physical
properties of these regions is the key to understand the process
of star formation.

The Taurus Molecular Cloud is one of
clos-
est,
low-mass star forming regions at 140 pc (Elias 1978;
Onishi et al. 2002). It was a target of several cloud evolu-
tion and star formation studies (Ungerechts & Thaddeus 1987;
Mizuno et al. 1995; Goldsmith et al. 2008) and was mapped
extensively in CO (Ungerechts & Thaddeus 1987; Onishi et al.

the

1996; Narayanan et al. 2008) and extinction (Cambrésy 1999;
Padoan et al. 2002; Dobashi et al. 2005). The most massive
molecular cloud in Taurus is the Heiles Cloud 2 (HCL 2; Heiles
1968; Onishi et al. 1996; Tóth et al. 2004) which is the second
brightest source on the 353, 545 and 857 GHz Planck maps
(Tauber et al. 2010; Planck Collaboration et al. 2011b) in Tau-
rus, with a ﬂux density peak in HCL 2B (Heiles 1968).

There are 406 Planck Galactic Cold Clumps (PGCCs)
in the Taurus region (Planck Collaboration et al. 2015). These
are clustered and form 76 groups as it was found by
Tóth et al. (2016) using the Minimum Spanning Tree method
(Planck Collaboration et al. 2011d). One of the largest PGCC
groups is HCL 2 with 14 cold clumps, their parameters are
listed in Table 1. The clump temperatures and densities were de-
rived from Herschel maps (see Section 2.4). The structure of the
PGCC group is shown in Fig. 1 that also serves as a ﬁnding chart
for the parts of HCL 2.

Molecular emission maps show the south-eastern part of
HCL 2 as a ring-like structure called the Taurus Molecular
Ring (TMR; Schloerb & Snell 1984). TMC-1 appears as a dense,

narrow ridge at the eastern edge of TMR. Two PGCCs are
found in this region, almost parallel with the galactic plane.
Radio spectroscopic surveys indicated a considerable variation
in the relative abundance of gas phase molecules, e.g. well-
separated cyanopolyyne, ammonia (Little et al. 1979) and SO
(Pratap et al. 1997) peaks (see also Table 1). Studies of NH3,
HCnN (n = 3,5,7), C4H, CS, C34S, HCS+ (Tölle et al. 1981;
Gaida et al. 1984; Olano et al. 1988; Hirahara et al. 1992), CH
(Suutarinen et al. 2011; Sakai et al. 2012) and other carbon-
chain and sulfur-containing molecules (Langer et al. 1995;
Pratap et al. 1997) show complex velocity and chemical struc-
ture in TMC-1. Hirahara et al. (1992) suggested that the dis-
placement of the column density peaks of carbon-chain and ni-
trogen bearing molecules is due to the diﬀerent evolutionary
states of the regions. The molecular abundances in TMC-1 were
modelled by McElroy et al. (2013) using the ﬁfth release of the
UMIST Database for Astrochemistry.

The morphologic and evolutionary connection between
TMC-1 and HCL 2 was described by Schloerb et al. (1983)
and Schloerb & Snell (1984) as TMC-1 being a collapsing,
fragmented part of a torus shaped cloud structure (TMR).
Cernicharo & Guelin (1987) considered TMC-1 a clump inside
a thick, bent ﬁlamentary complex projecting itself as a loop on
the plane of the sky. The existence and relative motion of frag-
ments in TMC-1 were discussed in various papers (Snell et al.
1982; Schloerb et al. 1983; Olano et al. 1988; Hirahara et al.
1992; Langer et al. 1995; Pratap et al. 1997). Nutter et al. (2008)
concluded that in sub-millimeter and FIR, TMR is composed
of a dense ﬁlament on one side (TMC-1) and a series of
point-like sources on the other. High spatial resolution Her-
schel (Pilbratt et al. 2010) observations resolved the cold clumps
found by Planck and their physical characteristics could be de-
termined. Malinen et al. (2012) identiﬁed two long ﬁlaments in
HCL 2 based on NIR extinction and Herschel data, one of which
was TMC-1. They ﬁtted the column density perpendicular to
the ﬁlament with a Plummer-like proﬁle and derived an average
width of 0.1 pc, which is typical of star forming ﬁlaments.

In this paper we discuss the substructures of TMC-1 using
our high S/N NH3(1,1) and NH3(2,2) line observations and high
resolution Herschel FIR maps. We examine the possibility of
overlapping sub-ﬁlaments being present inside the cloud by par-
titioning it using various clustering methods in the derived pa-
rameter space. We reveal the morphology of TMC-1 and assess
the physical state and stability of the diﬀerent cloud parts.

2. Observations and data reduction

2.1. NH3 observations

The observations of the NH3(J,K) = (1,1) and (2,2) inversion
transitions were carried out with the Eﬀelsberg 100-m telescope1
during November 21-30, 2008, April 8-13, 2015 and Septem-
ber 10, 2015. The map was obtained in raster mode, which was
a number of targeted observations on a grid with a spacing of
40 ′′ (0.027 pc at the distance of TMC-1) with a velocity res-
olution of 0.038 kms−1. The (0,0) position of the spectral grid
was α(2000) = 04:41:42.5, δ(2000) = 25:41:27. The spectra from
2008 were observed in both position switching (PSW) and fre-
quency switching (FSW) modes, both lines and polarizations
were measured simultaneously. 44% of the data were PSW and

56% FSW, the frequency throw of the FSW observations was
5 MHz. After the folding and baseline subtraction of the FSW
spectra, the FSW and PSW observations were averaged together
weighted by noise. The spectra from 2015 were measured only
in FSW mode with a frequency throw of 6 MHz. The pointing
errors are within 5-10 ′′ for both datasets. We observed a total
of 258 positions with a typical integration time of 4 minutes, a
sample spectrum is shown in Fig. 2.

The observing sessions started by measuring the continuum
emission of calibration sources (NGC 7027, W3OH). Pointing
measurements towards a source close to the target were re-
peated at least once per hour. For the observations from 2008
NGC 7027 was used for ﬂux calibration with an assumed ﬂux
density of 5.51 Jy (Zijlstra et al. 2008). With the average beam
size of 37.1 ′′ of the receiver this is equivalent to a main beam
brightness temperature TMB = 8.7 K. We calibrated to the eleva-
tion dependent atmospheric and instrumental gain and eﬃciency
with a quadratic function, which was calculated from observing
NGC 7027 at diﬀerent elevations during the observing sessions.
The calibration of the 2008 dataset is estimated to be accurate to
±15%.
The data from 2015 was observed with a diﬀerent receiver
(the secondary focus system instead of the prime focus K-band
receiver used in 2008) which had an average beam size of 36.6 ′′.
The ﬂux calibrator was NGC 7027 again, but since is a planetary
nebula that expands adiabatically, its ﬂux density decreases. Ac-
cording to the model by Zijlstra et al. (2008) it was ≈ 5.46 Jy
in 2015. This gives TMB = 8.8 K which was used to calibrate
the 2015 dataset. The spectra on the positions observed in both
2008 and 2015 have an ≈10% diﬀerence in intensity, resulting

in a 15% accuracy of the merged dataset. The data were re-
duced and further analysed with the software packages CLASS
and GREG2. The calibrated spectra have a typical rms noise of
0.15 K. NH3(1,1) was detected with S/N > 3 on 171 positions and
the NH3(2,2) line was detected with S/N >3 on 17 positions. The
given line temperatures in this paper are in TMB.

2.2. SeparatingNH3(1,1)velocitycomponents

In order to discern the diﬀerent velocity components in the
NH3(1,1) data, instead of ﬁtting one hyperﬁne-split (HFS) line
proﬁle, we analyzed the spectra as follows. We ﬁrst ﬁtted a sin-
gle HFS line proﬁle, subtracted it, then searched the residual for
a second component with S/N > 3. This line was also ﬁtted with
a HFS line proﬁle. Since in some cases the HFS structure of the
secondary components were not detected and the τ(1,1) optical
depth could not be determined well, the vLSR line velocity in the
Local Standard Rest frame and the peak TMB values from this
ﬁt were veriﬁed with a Gaussian proﬁle ﬁt. We then simultane-
ously ﬁtted both the primary and the secondary components with
HFS line proﬁles on the original spectra. During this ﬁnal ﬁt the
software CLASS required initial line parameters for both lines:
TMB(1,1), vLSR, τ(1,1) and ∆v linewidth. For the primary com-
ponent the initial parameters were the results of the single HFS
line proﬁle ﬁt and for the secondary component vLSR and ∆v
were taken from the HFS line proﬁle ﬁt of the line on the resid-
ual, TMB(1,1) from the Gaussian ﬁt and the initial optical depth
was 1. None of these parameters were ﬁxed during the simulta-
neous HFS proﬁle ﬁt. See Fig. 4 that demonstrates this process.
We note that line components were not discernible on any of the
NH3(2,2) spectra.

Fitting a single HFS line proﬁle to potentially multiple line
components during the ﬁrst step can be misleading, since to min-
imize the residual, the ﬁtting process broadens the resulting line.
In case the second component can be found on the residual, we
can ﬁt the original spectra again, using two components. But if

2 http://www.iram.fr/IRAMFR/GILDAS

the secondary component is blended suﬃciently and does not ap-
pear on the residual, a single HFS line proﬁle ﬁt will be able to
reproduce the line but give false line parameters. This appears as
an uncertainty in our calculations, however, the results are more
precise where we identify the secondary component. This way
we avoid the detection of a "fake" NH3(1,1) maximum and get a
more detailed picture of the velocity structure.

We examined the minimum separation of the two line com-
ponents where it is still possible to identify the weaker line com-
ponent on the residual. The NH3(1,1) line with the smallest ob-
served linewidth was added to an example spectra while its in-
tensity and their channel separation varied, then we proceeded
to search these spectra for the secondary component with our
method. With a channel width of 0.08 kms−1 and rms noise in
the range of 0.1-0.3 K, we can identify the secondary line com-
ponent with a channel separation of 3 channels (0.24 kms−1) only
if its intensity is greater than 50% of the primary component.
With a channel separation of 4 channels (0.32 kms−1) the sec-
ondary line with 30% of the primary line component intensity

can already be identiﬁed. The intensities of the detected sec-
ondary components were between 10% and 40% of the primary
component with velocity separations of about 0.08 km/s. Since
we ﬁtted both components with HFS line proﬁles and the sepa-
ration of the two lines is always greater than the HFS linewidths,
it is possible to detect close lines in a few cases.

2.3. GasparametercalculationsfromNH3 observations

When calculating gas temperatures and densities from the spec-
tra, the primary (or if no secondary component was identiﬁed,
the only) NH3(1,1) line component was used along with the
NH3(2,2) line on the positions where the (2,2) line was detected
with S/N > 3. We ﬁtted the primary NH3(1,1) components with
Gaussian functions to obtain TMB(1,1) and with HFS line pro-
ﬁles to get τ(1,1), vLSR and ∆v. The NH3(2,2) lines were ﬁtted
with Gaussian functions to get their peak main beam brightness
temperatures, TMB(2,2).

The calculations were done similarly as described by
Ho & Townes (1983), Ungerechts et al. (1986) and Harju et al.
(1993). The Trot rotation temperature of NH3 was calculated with

we assume a beam ﬁlling factor of 1 since the source is a nearby,
extended cloud. We calculated the column density of the ammo-

Notes. Numbers in the ﬁrst column refer to the marked positions in Fig. 3a and asterisk marks where a secondary line component was found.

Ammonia has two distinct species, the ortho-NH3 (K = 3n) and
the para-NH3 (K , 3n), which arise from diﬀerent relative orien-
tations of the three hydrogen spins. Since the higher energy lev-
els are by orders of magnitude less populated on temperatures
around 10 K, we may estimate the Np(NH3) para-NH3 column
density from the observed (1,1) and (2,2) transitions with

Np(NH3) = N(NH3(1, 1)) 1 +

The Tkin kinetic temperature of the gas was calculated with the
half-empiric equation from Tafalla et al. (2004):

where C is the collisional de-excitation rate (8.5 × 10−11 cm3s−1)
from Danby et al. (1988).
We calculated Np(NH3) upper limits from the secondary
NH3(1,1) line components at each of the 31 positions where
those were detected (see Fig. 5 and Appendix B). Based on the
HFS line proﬁle ﬁts, on 82 positions the τ(1,1) optical depth had
a relative error less than 50% (median relative error was 17%),
so from these high S/N spectra the N(NH3(1,1)) column density
could be estimated.

2.4. Herschelobservationsanddatareduction

The Taurus region has been observed as part of the Herschel
Gould Belt Survey (André et al. 2010; Kirk et al. 2013). The
SPIRE instrument (Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver)
used three arrays of bolometers to observe wavelengths cen-
tered at 250, 350 and 500 µm with bandwidths of 33% each,

The n(H2) local molecular hydrogen volume density was esti-
mated using the equation from Ho & Townes (1983):

eﬀectively covering the 208-583 µm range (Griﬃn et al. 2010).
The FWHM beam sizes were 17.6 ′′, 23.9 ′′ and 35.2 ′′ for the
three bands respectively and the ﬁeld-of-view was 4 × 8 ′. PACS
(Photodetector Array Camera and Spectrometer) observed wave-
lengths from 60 to 210 µm with two bolometer arrays, simul-
taneously with the 125-210 µm band (red) and with either the
60-85 or the 85-125 µm band (blue) (Poglitsch et al. 2010). The
blue channels had 32 × 64 pixel arrays and the red channel had
a 16 × 32 pixels array. Both channels covered a ﬁeld-of view of
1.75× 3.5 ′ with full beam spacing in each band.

TMC-1, as a part of HCL 2, was mapped using the
fast-scanning SPIRE/PACS Parallel Mode in two orthogonal
scan directions. The Herschel observation IDs of the data are
1342202252 and 1342202253. The data presented in this paper
were processed with HIPE3 12.1.0. The level-0.5 timelines were
calibrated and converted to physical units separately and joined
in the level-1 stage. The destriper module was applied to remove
the observation baseline. Then the sourceExtractorTimeline and
the sourceExtractorSussextractor tasks were used to search for
point sources in the data with a given FWHM and to determine
their ﬂuxes. The point sources then were subtracted with the
sourceSubtractor task from the timeline data of all three wave-
lengths. See the HIPE Help System4 for the description of the
applied tasks. We located 4 point sources on the 350 µm time-
line, one of them, IRAS 04381+2540 is also seen on 250 and
500 µm. After point source subtraction the maps were combined
using the naive map-making method. Absolute calibrated maps
were produced with the ZeroPointCorrection task which calcu-
lates the absolute oﬀsets by cross-correlating with Planck HFI
545 and 857 GHz data. The calibration accuracy of the SPIRE
data is estimated to be 7%. After convolution to 40 ′′ common
resolution the maps were co-aligned on the 500 µm pixel-grid
with 14 ′′ pixel width and each pixel was colour-corrected.

2.5. CalculationsfromHerschelSPIREdata

We used the method by Juvela et al. (2012) to derive hydrogen
column density from the SPIRE maps. We ﬁtted the spectral
energy distribution (SED) of each pixel with Bν(T dust)νβ where
Bν(T) is the Planck-function for a black-body with colour tem-
perature T dust at ν frequency. The value of β varies between
1.8 to 2.2 in the cold dense ISM, anti-correlates with temper-
ature and correlates with column density and galactic position
(Juvela et al. 2015b), see Appendix A.2 for further information.
In our calculations the SED was ﬁtted to all three SPIRE data
points with a ﬁxed β = 2 spectral index and returned Tdust for
each pixel.

The N(H2) molecular hydrogen column density was calcu-

lated as:

N(H2) =

Iν

Bν(T dust)κmHµ

(9)

where µ = 2.33 the particle mass per hydrogen molecule, mH
is the atomic mass unit, κ is the dust opacity from the for-
mula 0.1 cm2/g(ν/1000 GHz)β for high-density environments
(Beckwith et al. 1990; Planck Collaboration et al. 2011d) and Iν
is the intensity at ν = 856 GHz (λ = 350 µm). The 350 µm Her-
schel band overlaps with the Planck 857 GHz band which was
used for zero-point correction. This way we minimize the error
that originates from the absolute calibration.

The N(H2) distribution calculated this way does not exclude
the contribution of structures in the foreground or the back-
ground of HCL 2. In order to correct for this, the extent of HCL
2 was marked with the AV=1 magnitude contour (9.4× 1020
cm−2, where interstellar hydrogen starts to become molecular;
Bohlin et al. 1978) on the N(H2) map derived as written above.
Then the average 250, 350 and 500 µm intensity at this con-
tour was subtracted from the corresponding SPIRE 250, 350 and
500 µm maps. The ﬁnal Tdust and N(H2) maps were calculated
from these background subtracted intensity images. Other meth-
ods of background subtraction are evaluated in Appendix A.1.

Pagani et al. (2015) concluded that a single-temperature
SED ﬁtting we use here may miss some of the cold dust in
dense cores, thus we probably slightly underestimate the total
column density. With only three SPIRE data points, we cannot
ﬁt multi-temperature SEDs to model an even colder component
but this can be checked with independent methods, such as star-
reddening. Malinen et al. (2012) compared FIR emission based
and NIR reddening based N(H2) values in HCL 2, and they found
that the two methods are in good agreement. A signiﬁcant source
of uncertainty in the N(H2) calculation is the error in the surface
brightness, as shown by Juvela et al. (2012) using Monte Carlo
simulations. Assuming a 13% uncertainty in the Herschel inten-
sities an error of less than 1.5 K appears in regions with tempera-
tures below 16 K. This corresponds to an error in N(H2) of a few
times 1021 cm−2 in the outer region of the ﬁlament and around
1-2 × 1022 cm−2 in the densest parts.

The Herschel Tdust map of TMC-1 is shown in Fig. 3a with
the positions of high NH3(2,2) S/N spectra, where temperatures
and densities from the NH3 data could be calculated (see Section
3.2). Tdust has a minimum of 10.4 K in the northern, densest part
and is 11 K at its southern end. Lower density outskirts are a few
K warmer.

ima appear in TMC-1. Two very elongated ones are along
the ridge with peaks 2 ′ north-west from TMC-1(NH3) with
N(H2) = 3.3× 1022cm−2 and ≈ 30 ′′ south-west from TMC-1 CP
with N(H2) = 2.7× 1022cm−2. The third local N(H2) maximum
is at ≈ 18 ′′ south-east from the position of the Class I protostar
IRAS 04381+2540 with N(H2) = 2.8 × 1022cm−2. The PGCCs
ellipses coincide with the northern and the southern ones. The
cloud parts can not be simply separated by the half power con-
tours, since the column density remains above 1022 cm−2 in the
central ridge along the ﬁlament. We cannot achieve a robust sep-
aration of sub-structures inside TMC-1 (see Appendix C.1) using
the N(H2) distribution only.

3.2. ResultsfromNH3 measurements

The NH3(1,1) integrated intensity contours coincide well with
the N(H2) distribution, as seen in Fig. 3b. The integrated inten-
sity has a peak at the densest, coldest part of the ﬁlament, ≈1 ′
to south-east of TMC-1(NH3), then the line intensities decrease
gradually towards the southern edge, while N(H2) remains over
1022 cm−2 even at the southern end of the ridge.

The measured NH3(1,1) primary component HFS linewidths
are in the range of 0.15-1.0 kms−1, with an average of ∆v of
0.39 kms−1. Due to the small linewidths and with our high veloc-
ity resolution, subregions could be separated by their velocities

and multiple velocity components could be identiﬁed. The spa-
tial distribution of velocities of the NH3(1,1) lines with S/N > 3
on 171 positions are plotted in Fig. 5a. The area marked by these
positions is above the Herschel-based 1022 cm−2 column den-
sity contour. At the northern part of the ridge the velocities are
around 5.9-6.0 kms−1 and most spectra show a secondary line
component with velocities around 5.2-5.5 kms−1. South-west of
the main ridge, near IRAS 04381+2540, a Class I young stel-
lar source (Terebey & Baud 1980) the primary line velocities are
lower (vLSR ≈ 5.2 kms−1). The secondary line components in this
same region have vLSR ≈ 5.9 kms−1, except one with 5.6 kms−1.
There is a 4.9 kms−1pc−1 velocity gradient seen in the middle
part (25:41:00 < δ(2000) < 25:47:00). The primary line compo-
nent velocities decrease southward from the mid-region of the
ridge from 5.9 to 5.5 km−1, while the secondary from the HFS
line proﬁle ﬁt was S/N > 3.

Fig. 5b shows that N(NH3(1,1)) was calculated on 82 po-
sitions that are all above the 1.3 × 1022 cm−2 Herschel contour.
The N(NH3(1,1)) distribution follows well the Herschel-based
N(H2) and reaches 1.5× 1014 cm−2 even around the CP peak. Its
maximum (1.4× 1015 cm−2) is at the oﬀset of (-320,440), with
absolute coordinates of α(2000) = 04:41:13, δ(2000) = 25:48:47
(position 7 in Fig. 3b). That is ≈ 1′ to north-west of the posi-
tion which was formerly known as the ammonia peak, i.e. TMC-
1(NH3).

The NH3(2,2) line was detected with S/N > 3 in as many
as 17 spectra, we mark the corresponding locations in TMC-
1 as position #s where the number s runs from 1 to 17 (see
Fig. 3a). Parameters at these positions were calculated accord-
ing to Section 2.3 and the results are listed in Table 2 where the
columns are: (1) number of position in Fig. 3, asterisk marks
where a secondary line component was found and subtracted be-
fore the calculations; (2,3) right ascension and declination oﬀ-
sets; (4) linewidth from HFS line proﬁle ﬁt; (5) optical depth;
(6) kinetic temperature; (7) excitation temperature; (8) rotation
temperature; (9,10) NH3 column density from the primary and
the secondary components respectively; (11) H2-volume den-
sity; (12,13) Herschel H2-column density and colour temper-
ature. Numbers in the ﬁrst column refer to the marked posi-
tions in Fig. 3. The derived Tkin values vary between 9 and
13 K with the exception of position #10 with 13.7 K. The NH3
column density is 2.8× 1014 < Np(NH3) < 1.4× 1015 cm−2 and
the H2 volume density is around 0.4 × 104 < n(H2) < 2.8× 104
cm−3. The Np(NH3) distribution generally follows the Her-
schel-based N(H2) distribution along the ridge, although their
linear correlation is not very high (the correlation coeﬃcient
is p = 0.4). The N(NH3(1,1)) maximum coincides with the
Np(NH3) = Np(NH3)prim + Np(NH3)sec maximum on position #7
and it should be considered as the new NH3 maximum of TMC-
1.

We calculated the NH3 relative abundance at our NH3 peak
and close to TMC-1 CP using the derived N(H2) and Np(NH3)
values in Table 2. This gives 5 × 10−8 and 1.4 × 10−8 respec-
tively, which are consistent with the estimates of Harju et al.
(1993) for dense cores in Orion and Cepheus (1-5× 10−8) and
with the chemical modeling of Suzuki et al. (1992) (around
10−8). Generally we ﬁnd higher abundances in the northern and
mid-region of TMC-1 and lower values around the YSO and in
the southern end.

The total velocity dispersion was calculated from the primary

NH3(1,1) component of the 17 high S/N spectra with

σtotal =

∆v

√8ln(2)

(10)

where ∆v is the HFS linewidth. The thermal component of the
velocity dispersion is

σth = s kBT kin

µNH3 mH

(11)

where µNH3 = 17 is the ammonia molar mass and mH is the
atomic mass unit. The non-thermal (turbulent) component was
then derived by

σnth

2 = σtotal

2

2 − σth

(12)

The thermal component is around 0.066-0.08 kms−1 in the 17
spectra and the non-thermal component is higher than this in al-
most every case, except on positions #1 and #10. The highest
turbulence is observed on positions #8, #13 and #16.

4. Discussion

4.1. Density,temperatureandvelocitystructure

We obtained the most extensive NH3 map of TMC-1 so far where
both the (1,1) and (2,2) transitions were measured with a low

noise level and high velocity resolution. Our observations con-
ﬁrm the variation in the NH3(1,1) line intensity in TMC-1 that
was described by several studies (Little et al. 1979; Olano et al.
1988; Hirahara et al. 1992; Pratap et al. 1997). Our average HFS
linewidths agree with the values of Tölle et al. (1981), although
we mapped a signiﬁcantly larger area.

Olano et al. (1988) measured NH3(1,1) with similar beam
size, velocity resolution and S/N in the high-density part of
TMC-1. They also observed the velocity diﬀerence between the
main part of the ridge and its southern end, and a considerably
diﬀerent velocity for the region around IRAS 04381+2540 (see
their Fig. 9.). They pointed out a velocity gradient across the
ridge as well. We could detect further velocity variations be-
cause our mapping extends further along and across the ridge
compared to theirs.

The Tex values we derived agree well with the 4-7 K range
given by Tölle et al. (1981). Their observations do not com-
pletely overlap with ours because they measured positions with
a spacing of 45 ′′, but the diﬀerence between their values and
ours on positions less than 35 ′′ apart is less than 25%, relative
to their values. They calculated Trot on two positions which are
relatively close (≈ 40 ′′ and ≈ 5 ′′) to our positions #11 and #15:
their values are 9.5 ± 1 K and 10.3± 2 K and we derived 8.8 K
and 10.5 K, respectively. Gaida et al. (1984) repeated NH3(1,1)
and (2,2) measurements on the positions of Tölle et al. (1981)
along the main ridge of TMC-1 and made two cuts perpendicu-
lar to the major axis as well. They calculated both NH3 column
densities and kinetic temperatures on three positions that are not
farther than 40 ′′ from our position #11, #13 and #15. Their Tkin,
Trot results are in agreement with ours but their N(NH3(1,1)) val-
ues are consistently 4-5 times higher than ours and N(NH3) only
agrees well on the higher density positions. Their vLSR and n(H2)
distribution along the main ridge also shows similar values as
measured by us. Our Tex values are somewhat lower than the
ones by Olano et al. (1988) (6-9 K), which they show on a plot
along the TMC-1 major axis. Their sample does not overlap with
ours either because of the diﬀerent (0,0) oﬀset coordinates they
used.

Pratap et al. (1997) and Hirahara et al. (1992) derived a fac-
tor of 5-6 higher H2-volume densities from HC3N and C34S
spectra than our results. Our NH3 measurements may not
trace the densest gas in TMC-1 because, as it was shown by
Bergin et al. (2002) and Pagani et al. (2005), NH3 is best used
as a tracer at lower than 5 × 105 cm−3 densities. Also because of
the low critical density (around 2 × 103 cm−3) of the (1,1) line, it
may have a substantial contribution from external, warmer layers
as well (Pagani et al. 2007). Our results do not show signiﬁcant
diﬀerences in volume densities along the ridge, while the obser-
vations by Hirahara et al. (1992) imply a gradient of a factor of
10 in n(H2) between TMC-1(NH3) and TMC-1 CP. The NH3
densities calculated by Tölle et al. (1981) at TMC-1(NH3) are
consistent with our results but their values are a factor of 2-3
higher at TMC-1CP. The results by Pratap et al. (1997) are con-
sistent with ours at TMC-1 CP but a factor of 2-3 lower than our
values in the northern region.

Nutter et al. (2008) presented temperature and density pro-

maps to derive the properties for TMC-1. Their results are con-
sistent with the ﬁndings of Nutter et al. (2008) and their N(H2)
peak is around 3.4× 1022 cm−2. This is our derived N(H2) max-
imum as well. We note that our calculations are based on point
source subtracted Herschel images. Tdust values derived by us
for the outer part of TMC-1 are consistent with the 12 K from
Nutter et al. (2008) but we measure 10 K in the inner region in-
stead of 8 K. Tkin derived from NH3 and Tdust derived from the
Herschel measurements vary similarly but do not agree well,
since the cooling-heating processes are diﬀerent for gas and dust
and the coupling of the two phases are not guaranteed in regions
with n(H2) = 104 cm−3 (Goldsmith 2001).

4.2. Sub-structuresinTMC-1

4.2.1. Clustering methods and their results

The complex velocity structure and the appearance of secondary
velocity components on several spectra suggest diﬀerent cloud
parts being present in TMC-1. Since the ﬁlament is not necessar-
ily one coherent structure and it could be interpreted as a chain
of clumps, or even a complex superposition of ﬁlaments con-
taining smaller-scale cores, we apply several types of clustering
methods to reveal its morphology.

Clump-ﬁnding in the NH3 PPV datacube with methods like
the 3D version of clumpfind, gaussclump or the dendogram tech-
nique (see Appendix C.1) is problematic in the case of TMC-1,
since NH3 abundance can be position-dependent in the cloud.
Moreover, NH3 alone is not a good tracer for clumps because of
high optical depth eﬀects like self-absorption, which aﬀects the
line proﬁles. Searching for clumps in the Herschel-based N(H2)
distribution is not enough either, since N(H2) changes smoothly
along the ridge. As we can see from a quick decomposition of
the ﬁlament with clumpfind in Appendix C.1, we do not get a ro-
bust result: the extent and shape of the derived clumps strongly
depend on the initial parameters given to the clump ﬁnding algo-
rithm. Also, this way we ignore the velocity information derived
from molecular emission that traces the relative motions of the
gas and can help identifying structures in the line of sight.

We expect that the presence of a clump changes the N(H2)
distribution in its direction. We assume that inside a clump
N(H2) changes continuously, velocities scatter around a certain

jected back to the plane of the sky. The grey contours are the Herschel
N(H2): 0.7, 1.0, 1.3, 1.6, 2, 2.3, 2.6 × 1022 cm−2 (from 20 to 80% of the
maximum by 10%). The positions of TMC-1 CP, IRAS 04381+2540,

value and the clump appears as an object roughly in the same
direction on the plane of the sky. Thus, we combine the vLSR
derived from the HFS line proﬁle ﬁt of the NH3(1,1) primary
components and the Herschel-based N(H2) values on every po-
sition where the (1,1) line was observed with S/N > 3. Then we
search for clusters in this position-position-velocity-column den-
sity datacube. The importance of the secondary line components
is discussed after (see Section 4.2.2).

The number of clusters in the cloud was not known and
we did not want to decide which clustering method to use
for the proportioning beforehand. Because of this we used the
NbClust algorithm of the R statistical computing environment
(Charrad et al. 2014), which is able to run several types of clus-
tering methods while varying the number of clusters to be de-
rived. It computes so-called cluster validity indices to inspect the
results of the diﬀerent runs, decides what is the most appropri-
ate number of clusters in a dataset and performs the clustering
itself as well. NbClust is able to run the k-means method (see
Appendix C.2) and hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC)
methods with 8 diﬀerent agglomeration criteria (see Appendix
C.3). A more detailed description of the NbClust package and
the used indices can be found in Appendix C.4.

Since our parameters in the dataset are measured on diﬀer-
ent scales, standardization is necessary. We converted the posi-
tion oﬀsets to galactic oﬀsets in arcminutes, the velocity to tenth
of kms−1 and the column density to 1021 cm−2 to bring the pa-
rameter ranges closer to each other. Then we used the min-max
scaling where the normalized value of parameter pi of the nth
point in the dataset is deﬁned by:

pi,n,norm =

pi,n − pi,min
pi,max − pi,min

p2, p3, p4] point in the 4D parameter space with n points. Min-
max scaling or scaling by the range of the variables was shown
to give more accurate results for the most known clustering tech-
niques, than using traditional standardization methods, like z-
score (Steinley 2004).

NbClust also requires the deﬁnition of a distance metric. We
used Euclidean distance metric where the distance between two
points (x1 and x2) in the i=4 dimensional parameter space is:

d(x1, x2) = vut 4
Xi=1

(x1,i − x2,i)2

(14)

We can then deﬁne within-cluster and between-cluster distances
for points inside one cluster and of two diﬀerent clusters respec-
tively.

The 9 available clustering methods in NbClust were run on
the scaled and normalized TMC-1 joined dataset. When deter-
mining the ideal number of clusters with a certain clustering
method, the number of clusters that was allowed to be derived
varied from 2 to 15. NbClust computed 30 indices to measure
the validity of the derived clusters (see App. C.4) in each case.
Each index suggested the ideal number of clusters that should be
derived by the method and the ﬁnal decision was made by the
majority rule. After this the clustering was performed. The ﬁnal
results of the 9 clustering methods are plotted on Fig. C.2.

Four clustering methods provided similar division of TMC-
1 into 4 parts, see Fig C.2b,c,d and Fig. 6. The HAC method
with the average agglomeration criterion derived 3 clusters (Fig.
C.2e), McQuitty’s criterion derived 15 parts (Fig. C.2a), and the
HAC method with the median, centroid and single agglomera-
tion criteria did not part the ﬁlament (Fig. C.2f,g,h).

In order to decide between the results of the 9 clustering
methods, the sum and the weighted sum of the within-cluster
variances were determined for each method. We ﬁrst calcu-
lated the variance of the distances of all cluster members from
the cluster centers in every cluster resulted by each clustering
method with
S k = (hxi − xk)2
σ2 = Pk (hS ki − S k)2
where k is the index of points inside a cluster, Sk are the distances
of each cluster member (xk) from the cluster center (hxi) in each
cluster and σ2 is the variance of these distances for each clus-
ter. Then we calculated a sum (Cm) and a weighted sum (Cm,w),

(16)

(15)

k

adding together the cluster variances of the clusters belonging to
each clustering method with

(17)

(18)

Cm =X σ2
Cm,w =X wσ2

where w weight is the number of pixels in a cluster. The most ap-
propriate number of clusters and the number of indices suggest-
ing that number are found in Table 3 for each clustering method,
along with the derived sum and weighted sum of variances for
the methods.

The HAC method with McQuitty’s agglomeration criterion
derived the clusters with the minimal sum and weighted sum of
variances in the 4D-parameter space. However, when the clus-
ters are projected back to the sky we ﬁnd one too small fragment
(only 3 pixels), and there are 3 fragments that are not continuous,
but each of them is broken into two or three isolated parts. The
existence of several very small fragments may be proved mea-
suring several chemical species and using high spatial resolution
and small spacing, but in the current study we accept the results
of the k-means method as best, which had the second minimal
sum of within-cluster variances.

The 4 clusters resulted by the k-means method were pro-
jected back to the plane of the sky, deﬁning 4 objects, each of
them is contiguous (see Fig. 6). Three of these sub-ﬁlaments
are very elongated (TMC-1F1, TMC-1F2, TMC-1F4) and one of
them (TMC-1F3) is less so. TMC-1F1 appears with the highest
velocities and column densities, while TMC-1F2 on the north-
eastern edge has the lowest kinetic temperature. The environ-
ment of the YSO makes up TMC-1F3. TMC-1F4 encompasses
the middle and the southern regions with a range of velocities
and has the highest average linewidth.

The secondary NH3(1,1) line components in TMC-1F3 ap-
pear at a velocity of the neighbouring TMC-1F1. Similarly, the
secondary NH3(1,1) line components in TMC-1F1 appear at 5.2-
5.4 kms−1 i.e. the velocity of TMC-1F3. The kinematics thus
suggests that the clumps are slightly overlapped. Few spectra
with secondary components in TMC-1F4 indicate small frag-
ments with velocities similar to that of TMC-1F1 and TMC-1F2.
Despite the scaling and the normalization of the parameters
of the joined dataset, the Euclidean distance measured in one di-
mension can not be unequivocally compared with the distance
measured in another, since the parameters are independent and
not interchangeable. For example, the min-max normalization
only works well if the dispersion in each dimension is small
and there are no extreme points that distort the calculations. The
careful selection of the 82 spectral positions with high S/N NH3
measurements and the smoothly changing N(H2) ensures that

this is not the case in this dataset. However, to reveal the dis-
crepancies originating from using these statistical methods with
a dataset like this, in a later study our methods should be carried
out side by side with other clump-ﬁnding methods on a more ex-
tended dataset, where the decomposition of the molecular cloud
is known, can be veriﬁed and the results can be compared.

4.2.2. The parameters and stability of the sub-ﬁlaments

Averaged Herschel-based Tdust,ave were calculated inside the sub-
ﬁlament contours and were found to be the same within 0.5 K
for each sub-ﬁlament. Tkin,ave kinetic temperatures of the sub-
ﬁlaments were calculated as an average of the corresponding Tkin
values on the positions of the 17 high S/N NH3(2,2) spectra (see
Table 2) inside the given sub-ﬁlament. Apparently, Tkin shows a
higher variation than Tdust, that is also seen in the averaged val-
ues. Background corrected column densities were calculated for
each sub-ﬁlament subtracting an average background N(H2) of
HCL 2. Then the total hydrogen mass was calculated integrating
inside the sub-ﬁlament boundary. In our simpliﬁed assumptions
the sub-ﬁlaments are considered as cylinders with L length and
r radius and they are roughly perpendicular to the line of sight.
L is their maximum diameter along the galactic plane and r is
half of their diameter perpendicular to this. The linear mass of
the sub-ﬁlaments was calculated dividing their mass with the L
length. TMC-1F1 has the highest N(H2)ave value and TMC-F4
has the highest mass.

The greatest uncertainty of the mass calculation is the er-
ror in the N(H2) distribution caused by the ≈1.5 K uncertainty
of the Tdust map. According to this, the calculated linear masses
can have an error up to 56%. We note here that the uncertainty
of the Tdust values was a conservative estimate but still this er-
ror makes our virial stability consideration uncertain. Addition-
ally, because of our sub-ﬁlaments overlap, N(H2) derived from
the dust emission originates from more than one structures. The
ratio of Np(NH3) derived from the secondary components and
the total Np(NH3) is around 10%. If we assume that the relative
abundance of NH3 does not change much inside a sub-ﬁlament,
this means that the ratio of Np(NH3) from the main and sec-
ondary line components reﬂects the ratio of N(H2) between the
two overlapping cloud parts. Thus we can say that the contribu-
tion of the overlapping part of a sub-ﬁlament to the mass of the
other one is negligible.

We calculated the total (σtotal,ave), the thermal (σth,ave) and
the non-thermal velocity dispersion (σnth,ave) inside each sub-
ﬁlament from the ∆v HFS linewidth of their averaged spectra
with equations 10, 11 and 12. We note that the total velocity dis-
persion includes the velocity gradients inside the sub-ﬁlaments,
these are 0.18, 0.15, 0.03 and 0.35 kms−1pc−1 for TMC-1F1 to

F4, respectively. Then the virial mass per unit length of the sub-
ﬁlaments could be derived with

Mlin,vir =

2σH2,total,ave

G

(19)

where σH2 ,total,ave is the total velocity dispersion of the hydrogen
(Ostriker 1964). This is calculated as

σH2,total,ave = qσnth,ave

2 + σH2,th,ave

(20)

The physical parameters of the sub-ﬁlaments are listed in Table
4. The mass of the sub-ﬁlaments are slightly above (TMC-1F1
and TMC-1F4) or below (TMC-1F2 and TMC-1F3) their virial
mass per unit length but with uncertainties around 50% in the
observed linear masses we can only safely say that all of them
are close to equilibrium. The non-thermal support of the sub-
ﬁlaments is generally 2-2.5 times higher than the thermal. We
note that there is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the parame-
ters of the clusters (size, shape, masses) from the k-means and
the other clustering methods that also derived 4 clusters.

4.2.3. Sub-ﬁlaments TMC-1F1, TMC-1F2 and TMC-1F4

Our results show that the main ridge of TMC-1 can be resolved
into 3 sub-ﬁlaments. A minimal overlap of TMC-1F4 and TMC-
1F2 or the presence of other small fragments is seen in the mid-
dle of the ridge in the presence of secondary line components.
Otherwise these sub-ﬁlaments are quite well-separated. TMC-
1F4 has the highest average turbulent velocity dispersion. The
N(NH3(1,1)) distribution peaks inside TMC-1F1 (see the upside
down triangle in Fig. 5b), that is also the position of the maxima
of Np(NH3) and n(H2) (see Table 2).

Snell et al. (1982) observed TMC-1 in C34S(1-0) and (2-
1) and divided it into six fragments ([SLF82] A to F), many
of those were overlapping. The position, extent and velocity
of [SLF82] B and [SLF82] C roughly correspond to TMC-
1F4. Their [SLF82] A, [SLF82] D and [SLF82] F coincide with
the positions of TMC-1F1 and TMC-1F2, and the velocities of
[SLF82] D and [SLF82] F are also similar to that of TMC-1F1
and TMC-1F2.

Hirahara et al. (1992) found six cores on CCS emission maps
of TMC-1. In the northern region, their core A and B (TMC-
1B) coincide with the northern part of our TMC-1F1 and the
overlapping part of TMC-1F3 which we detected with the sec-
ondary line components. They divide our TMC-1F4 into two
parts, namely core C and D (TMC-1D) based on their CCS
channel maps. We note however that they appear as one object
with some structure on their CCS position-velocity and HC3N
integrated intesity maps. Their core E (TMC-1E) is positioned
south-east of the southern edge of TMC-1F4, where we did not
detect signiﬁcant NH3(1,1) emission. Associations of the sub-
ﬁlaments and these formally known parts of TMC-1 are in Table
5.

Pratap et al. (1997) mapped TMC-1 in SO(32-21), CS(2-1),
and HC3N(4-3) and (10-9). Their SO peak is ≈1′ north-east from
our NH3 peak in TMC-1F2 that we also recognize in their SO
channel maps. TMC-1F4 appears as an elongated maximum of
the HC3N(4-3) and (10-9) integrated intensity (see Fig. 7. in
Pratap et al. 1997). A secondary maximum is seen in HC3N in-
tegrated intensity maps inside our TMC-1F1. The relative den-
sity maxima of sulfur and nitrogen-bearing molecules are in
the northern sub-ﬁlaments, whereas TMC-1F4 is the relative

may recognize TMC-1F3 in the CS and SO integrated intensity
maps of Pratap et al. (1997).

TMC-1F3 was also located by Yıldız et al. (2015) in 12CO
with a velocity of 5.2 kms−1. Its position coincides with that
of the protostar IRAS 04381+2540 (Beichman et al. 1986)
that is known to drive a bipolar outﬂow detected in 12CO
(Bontemps et al. 1996), and H2 (Gomez et al. 1997). Its disk
was resolved, and a YSO mass of 0.54 M
was estimated by
Harsono et al. (2014). Apai et al. (2005) described it as a bi-
nary in formation with a jet and a substellar companion, and
showed that the northern outﬂow cavity is opening towards us.
According to Yıldız et al. (2013) the velocity of the YSO is
vLSR = 5.2 kms−1 that agrees with that of our NH3 clump (5.2-
5.4 kms−1). The non-thermal velocity dispersion of TMC-1F3
is the second highest and its thermal velocity dispersion is the
highest of all four sub-ﬁlaments.

⊙

From the positional coincidence and velocity one may as-
sume that the Class I protostar is related to the sub-ﬁlament. The
relatively high average kinetic temperature (13 K, see Table 4)
of TMC-1F3 we interpret as a possible signature of the heating
by IRAS 04381+2540. In fact the highest kinetic and dust tem-
peratures were measured at the YSO position (see position #10
with Tkin ≈ 14 K and Tdust = 11.4 K in Table 2).
The highest HFS linewidth of the NH3(1,1) primary line
components is at position #8 and around it (∆v = 0.39 kms−1,
Tkin = 10.6 K, see Table 2) in TMC-1F1. It could be explained
by the outﬂow of IRAS 04381+2540 (120′′ south-west of #8)
releasing mechanical energy towards the main ridge. But the out-
ﬂow is very compact, with a lobe extent of only around 40 ′′ to
the north and south according to Hogerheijde et al. (1998) and
Yıldız et al. (2015). The northern outﬂow lobe is blue-shifted,
opening towards the observer, thus the protostar has to be posi-
tioned behind the main ridge and the outﬂow should extend to at
least 120 ′′ (projected distance of position #8) in order to aﬀect
the main ridge. Hogerheijde et al. (1998) calculated a dynamical
age of 2100 years from a 12CO(3-2) outﬂow extent of 0.02 pc and
outﬂow velocity of 9.3 kms−1. One may however assume that a
jet with about an order of magnitude higher speed propagated
to more than 0.1 pc in the same time interval. We note here that
velocities up to 70 kms−1 were observed also at very low-mass
YSOs (see e.g. ISO 143 in Joergens et al. 2012). Our assumption
from the above geometry is that the protostar IRAS 04381+2540
is embedded in TMC-1F3 that may be located around 0.1 pc be-
hind the main ridge.

4.2.5. Fray and fragment?

The primary NH3(1,1) line component vLSR velocity distribu-
tion in TMC-1F1 and TMC-1F4 is continuous, as seen in Fig.
7. A velocity gradient of ≈ 0.45 kms−1pc−1 is seen from SE to
NW. An oscillating behaviour can be observed above the gradi-
ent in both sub-ﬁlaments, but with a higher dispersion in TMC-
1F4, and the wavelength of the periodical change in TMC-
1F1 from a sinusoidal approximation is ≈ 0.3 pc. Similar ve-
locity oscillations were observed in several ﬁlaments in L1517
(Hacar & Tafalla 2011) together with sinusoidal column density
oscillations as an evidence of core formation. The non-thermal
velocity dispersions also show oscillations and are mostly sub-
= 0.19 kms−1 in
the two sub-ﬁlaments. Supersonic points could be explained by
confusion of multiple velocity components or outﬂows from em-
bedded sources inside the sub-ﬁlaments. The pattern of velocity

density maximum region of the carbon-chain molecules. The
cyanopolyyne peak TMC-1 CP is roughly in the middle of TMC-
1F4.

TMC-1F1 and TMC-1F4 are associated with two and one
350 µm Herschel point sources respectively. We can not exclude
that the higher Tkin measured at position #1 (see Table 2) is re-
lated to the nearby Herschel point source, although we do not
measure an increased temperature at position #2. The nature of
the Herschel FIR point sources, other NIR point sources in the
region (see eg. Tóth et al. 2004) and their relation to the ISM
will be discussed elsewhere.

We note that the HAC method with McQuitty’s agglomera-
tion criterion deﬁnes 12 sub-ﬁlaments in the main ridge (M1 to
M12 in Fig. C.2a). None of those have the same position, veloc-
ity and extent as any of the Snell et al. (1982) or Hirahara et al.
(1992) fragments, but the fragment M4 which coincides with the
Np(NH3) and N(H2) peak region, is located close to fragment A
by Hirahara et al. (1992), although it has a greater extent.

4.2.4. Sub-ﬁlament TMC-1F3 and the Class I protostar IRAS

04381+2540

TMC-1F3 is separated from the main ﬁlament both in position
and velocity. The velocity and position of a CS local maximum,
Snell et al. (1982) fragment A, roughly corresponds to TMC-
1F3. Their Fig. 8 also indicates that TMC-1F3 partly overlaps
with the main ridge. The displacement of the CS peak may be
partly due to their low resolution (HPBW ≈ 2 ′) or a chemistry ef-
fect. TMC-1F3 corresponds to TMC-1X (identiﬁed as core X in
the CCS(4-3) position-velocity maps) of Hirahara et al. (1992).
It appears at similar velocities but with diﬀerent extent in their
HC3N(5-4) integrated intensity and NH3(1,1) channel maps. The
overlap with the main ridge is also apparent in their ﬁgures. One

dispersions may indicate that the sub-ﬁlaments are decoupled
from the large-scale turbulent velocity ﬁeld and the turbulent dis-
sipation in the cloud occurred at the scale of the sub-ﬁlaments
(Tafalla & Hacar 2015).

Comparing the position-velocity diagram of TMC-1F1 and
TMC-1F4, the latter looks less regular. Analysing a dust contin-
uum map of TMC-1, Suutarinen et al. (2011) suggested that the
southern half of the ridge has an extensive envelope, in contrast
to the northern, i.e. the NH3 peak region. They explain it as a dif-
ference in dynamical age: the northern part is more compressed.
Based on time dependent modeling of the observed variation of
chemistry they also concluded that the south-eastern end of the
cloud is also chemically less evolved than the north-eastern end.
The diﬀerence in the "chemical ages" of TMC-1F1 and TMC-
1F4 was also indicated by Berczik et al. (2015).

Peng et al. (1998) studied the fragmentation in a 8′×8′ re-
gion around TMC-1 CP in TMC-1F4 with CCS measurements.
They found 45 very small fragments with sizes of 0.02-0.04 pc
and masses of 0.04-0.6 M
, ﬁve of those fragments were grav-
itationally bound. The northern end of TMC-1F4 was resolved
into cores with sizes of 0.03-0.06 pc and masses of 0.03-2 M

by Langer et al. (1995), based on high resolution single-dish and
interferometric observations of CCS and CS.

Hierarchical fragmentation was found by Hacar et al. (2013)
and Tafalla & Hacar (2015) in the nearby L1495/B2013 com-
plex. The "fray and fragment" ﬁlament evolution scenario pro-
posed by them is the following: the ﬁlamentary cloud ﬁrst frag-
ments into intertwined, velocity-coherent ﬁlaments, so-called
ﬁbers. If the ﬁber can accumulate enough mass to become gravi-
tationally unstable, it can further fragment into chains of closely-
spaced cores in an almost quasi-static way. As seen in Table
4, the length of TMC-1F1, TMC-1F2 and TMC-1F4 is sim-
ilar that of the ﬁbers in L1495/B2013. The typical length of
the ﬁbers of Hacar et al. (2013) is 0.5 pc (ranging from 0.2 pc
to 1.2 pc). TMC-1F2 even has a similar linear mass as the
ﬁber [HTK2013] 32 of Hacar et al. (2013). However their typ-
ical 0.5 pc-long ﬁbers have a factor of two lower mass then the
sub-ﬁlaments of TMC-1. Some of their ﬁbers are unstable and
fragmented into chains of cores.

The velocity and linewidth distributions in TMC-1F1 in the
northern part of TMC-1 is very similar to that of the ﬁbers de-
scribed by Tafalla & Hacar (2015). The southern part of TMC-
1 with TMC-1F4 is said to be structurally and chemically less
evolved than the northern part of TMC-1, also the velocity dis-
persion is much higher in TMC-1F4 than in TMC-1F1. But there
are already small, gravitationally bound cores inside TMC-1F4.
It is not clear whether "fray and fragment" is the process shap-
ing TMC-1, because we cannot simply say that the ﬁlament ﬁrst
collapsed into velocity-coherent "ﬁbers" then formed cores in-
side them. One has to see the distribution of small-scale struc-
tures all along TMC-1, and discuss again the "fray and fragment"
scheme.

5. Conclusions

Our work contributes to the study of HCL 2, focusing on the
TMC-1 region based on Herschel SPIRE FIR and high S/N NH3
1.3 cm line mapping. We found TMC-1 as one of the coldest and
densest parts of HCL 2 (along with TMC-1C and HCL 2B) from
our N(H2) and Tdust calculations.

Our Herschel-based N(H2) shows values above 1022 cm−2
with two local maxima along a narrow ridge. The northern max-
imum is the peak N(H2) position with 3.3× 1022 cm−2. There is

a third, more separated peak south-west from this. Tdust is almost
constant along the higher density inner part of the ridge.

Fitting multiple HFS line proﬁles to the NH3(1,1) spec-
tra we identiﬁed multiple velocity components in the northern
region and calculated low turbulent velocity dispersions (0.1-
0.2 kms−1). The derived N(NH3(1,1)) distribution follows the
Herschel-based N(H2) distribution well. We deﬁne a new NH3-
peak in an oﬀset of ≈ 1′ relative from TMC-1(NH3). The NH3-
based n(H2) are lower than former C34S and HC3N-based values
with a factor of 5-6.

Based on the observed velocity and column density varia-
tions we partitioned TMC-1 using the NbClust package of R.
The 4 derived sub-ﬁlaments have masses of 20-40 M
, three of
them are quite elongated (TMC-1F1, TMC-1F2, TMC-1F4) and
all of them close to gravitational equilibrium. TMC-1F1 has the
NH3 peak and TMC-1F4 the cyanopolyyne peak inside. TMC-
1F3 partly overlaps with TMC-1F1, the Class I protostar IRAS
04381+2540 is apparently embedded into this sub-ﬁlament. The
protostellar outﬂow is probably aﬀecting TMC-1F1. The "fray
and fragment" process is one possible scenario for the structur-
ing of TMC-1 but the small-scale structure of TMC-1F1 should
be investigated to ascertain this scenario.

A more detailed description and analysis could be given by
a high resolution survey of the whole TMC-1 in carbonous and
nitrogen bearing molecules (e.g. CCS and NH3 lines) and then
using chemical and radiative transfer models in the interpreta-
tion.

Appendix A: Column density calculation from

HerschelSPIRE measurements

AppendixA.1: Determinationofthebackgroundlevel

The background/foreground subtraction used on the Herschel
SPIRE images after calibration with HIPE is described in Sec-
tion 2.5. The diﬀerence between Tdust without and with this cor-
rection is less than 0.5 K which means 1-3% diﬀerence in N(H2)
in the dense regions of TMC-1, increasing to 20-30% in the
outer regions. The contour value used to determine the back-
ground/foreground level is very similar to the baseline ﬁtted by
Malinen et al. (2012) when deriving radial density proﬁle for
TMC-1 and it was mentioned by them that a background sub-
traction may be needed when determining ﬁlament properties.

Another way of determining the background level is calcu-
lating N(H2) distribution without any correction, then taking the
contour above which we were able to detect NH3. This contour
is around 0.7 × 1022 cm−2 in our case and it marks the boundaries
of the dense ISM. We created Tdust and N(H2) with subtracting
the average intensities found at this contour from the SPIRE im-
ages. The diﬀerence between the Tdust values calculated with the
method in the paper and this method is around 1 K. It means a 10-
20% diﬀerence in N(H2) at the dense part of the ridge, quickly
increasing to more than half a magnitude diﬀerence close to the
marked boundary.

AppendixA.2: Theeffectofthespectralindex

AppendixC.1: Clusteringofmolecularclouds

Fehér et al.: Structure and stability in TMC-1

Early results from Planck showed that the dust opacity spec-
tral index, β is around 1.8 on the all-sky map observed by
Planck HFI (Planck Collaboration et al. 2011c). Later the sta-
tistical analysis of the properties of the Cold Clump Catalogue
of Planck Objects using Planck and IRAS observations deter-
mined that in the clumps β varies from 1.4 to 2.8 with a me-
dian value around 2.1 and it anti-correlates with temperature
(Planck Collaboration et al. 2011d). Planck Collaboration et al.
(2011a) examined the Taurus region and found β > 1.8 in struc-
tures with temperatures below 14 K. Juvela et al. (2012) used an
average value of 2 when determining the Tdust and N(H2) on the
ﬁelds observed during the Herschel Open Time Key Programme
Galactic Cold Cores. Recently Juvela et al. (2015b) examined
the sub-millimeter dust opacity and gave the average value of β
close to 1.9 and they indicated that it can be even higher in the
coldest regions. The variations of β were described in detail by
Juvela et al. (2015a). They derived β using diﬀerent combina-
tions of observations and concluded that it anti-correlates with
Tdust, correlates with N(H2) and galactic latitude and its value
depends on the wavelength of the observations used in the analy-
ses. Using Herschel measurements β = 2 is appropriate for dense
clumps and it can reach 2.2 in the coldest regions.

We used β = 2 in the calculations in this paper but estimated
the eﬀect of changing the spectral index between 1.8 and 2.2.
The diﬀerences in Tdust originating from this do not reach 10%
which gives a < 30% deviation in the derived N(H2) distribution.

Appendix B: Estimating Np(NH3) from the

secondary NH3(1,1) velocity components

The physical parameters of the gas were calculated using the
primary component of the NH3(1,1) line, however, the sec-
ondary components also contribute to the total Np(NH3) and
N(NH3(1,1)). This was estimated by ﬁrst calculating the fraction
of N(NH3(2,2)) compared to the total Np(NH3) from the primary
velocity components with equations 5 and 6. This gives typically
3-6% for the fraction of N(NH3(2,2)) in the total Np(NH3). We
then derived N(NH3(1,1)) from the secondary components with
equation 5. Since the HFS of the secondary components could
not be ﬁtted well (the relative error of τ was 50% even in the
best HFS line proﬁle ﬁt), we assumed an optical depth of τ = 0.1
as upper limit which was derived from the HFS line proﬁle ﬁt of
the noise-weighted average of all the secondary line spectra in
the northern region of TMC-1. Then assuming that the contribu-
tion of the molecules in the NH3(2,2) state is 10% of this (as a
conservative estimate), we computed the total Np(NH3) from the
secondary velocity components (see Table 2 in column 10).

Appendix C: Clustering methods

Clustering methods are categorized based on cluster models i.e.
how one deﬁnes what a cluster is. Typical models are e.g. con-
nectivity models, where clusters are based on distance connectiv-
ity (hierarchical clustering), centroid models, where each cluster
is represented by a single mean vector (k-means clustering), dis-
tribution, density or graph-based models. For each of the types
there are several sub-types and diﬀerent algorithms to ﬁnd clus-
ters in a dataset (Jain et al. 1999; Halkidi et al. 2000).

A well-known routine for identifying local maxima as peaks
of clumps and following them to lower levels is clumpfind
(Williams et al. 1994). clumpfind works by searching through
the data for distinct objects identiﬁed by closed contours from
the highest contour levels to the lowest. Contours that sur-
round only one peak are assigned to the corresponding clump,
blended contours that surround more than one peak are split up
using a "friends-of-friends" algorithm. The conservative vari-
ant of clumpfind, CSAR (Cardiﬀ Source-ﬁnding AlgoRithm;
Kirk et al. 2013) can be used in a hierarchical mode. gaussclump
(Stutzki & Guesten 1990; Kramer et al. 1998) iteratively ﬁts 3D
Gaussian functions to a data cube to derive sources. The dendro-
gram technique (Rosolowsky et al. 2008) combines the statisti-
cal approach with segmenting the data into physically relevant
structures while preserving and characterizing the hierarchy of
emission isosurfaces.

We included a decomposition of TMC-1 with clumpfind in
Fig. C.1 to show that the resulting clumps strongly depend on the
contouring threshold and stepsize used as an input. We applied
clumpfind with a contouring threshold of 3 σN and stepsizes of 1,
0.5 and 0.2 σN (where σN is the standard deviation measured on
the N(H2) map) and depending on the stepsize, resolved the ﬁla-
ment into 4, 5 and 7 clumps. This analysis shows that decreasing
the stepsize we can eﬀectively derive clumps around every local
N(H2) maxima and so clump ﬁnding with clumpfind and similar
methods on the N(H2) map is not suﬃcient enough in the case
of TMC-1.

AppendixC.2: K-meansclustering

The k-means clustering (MacQueen 1967; Murtagh & Heck
1987) uses the centroid cluster model. It is an iterative method
which minimizes the within-cluster sum of squares for a given
number of clusters, starting with an initial guess for cluster cen-
ters. Each observation is placed in the closest cluster, the cluster
centers are updated, then the process repeats itself until the clus-
ter centers no longer change.

AppendixC.3: Hierarchicalclustering

The hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) uses distance
connectivity and seeks to build a hierarchy, where each observa-
tion starts in its own cluster, then pairs of clusters are merged ac-
cording to an agglomeration criterion as one moves up the hier-
archy. Another approach is hierarchical divisive clustering where
all observations start in one cluster, and splits are performed re-
cursively as one moves down the hierarchy.

HAC methods require an agglomeration (or linkage) crite-
rion. When building the hierarchy of clusters found in a dataset,
the two clusters with the shortest distance between each other
are merged at each step. The linkage criterion deﬁnes the way
this between-cluster distance is measured. It can be deﬁned e.g.
as the distance of the elements that are the farthest away in
two clusters (complete-linkage; Sorensen 1948), the shortest dis-
tance between two elements not yet belonging to the same clus-
ter (single; Sokal & Michener 1958), the average distance of the
elements inside two clusters (average; Sokal & Michener 1958)
and the squared Euclidean distance between the gravity cen-
ters of two clusters (centroid; Sokal & Michener 1958). Linkage
criteria also can be determined with the weighted mean of the

between-cluster distances (McQuitty; McQuitty 1966), the me-
dian of the between-cluster distances (median; Gower 1966) or
with minimizing within-cluster variance (Ward and its second
variant; Ward 1963; Murtagh & Legendre 2014).

AppendixC.4: TheNbClustpackage

The R project for statistical computing provides a wide variety
of the previously listed algorithms. We used the NbClust pack-
age (Charrad et al. 2014) to select the best clustering method
with the most applicable input parameters to partition the TMC-
1 joined Herschel/NH3 dataset into clusters. The k-means and
HAC methods with 8 diﬀerent agglomeration criteria are both
available in NbClust. The package has been developed to not
only perform several types of clustering methods, but to eval-
uate the quality of clusters (the degree with which a clustering
scheme ﬁts a speciﬁc dataset) and the optimal number of clus-
ters (which is a required input parameter for the algorithms) in
a partitioning. This is the so-called cluster validity. For this pur-
pose, a variety of validity measures (indices) were deﬁned in the
literature. The main beneﬁt of using this package lies in the pos-
sibility of simultaneously evaluating several clustering schemes
while varying the number of clusters. This helps determining the
most appropriate number of clusters for the dataset, then the re-
sulting ideal clustering scheme can be run by the same package.
One ﬁrst has to deﬁne the distance measure to be used by
the clustering methods. The distance measure deﬁnes how the
distance of two vectors (elements or points in the dataset) are
calculated during the clustering process. Euclidean distance is
the usual square distance between two vectors, Manhattan dis-
tance measures the absolute distance and maximum distance
is the greatest distance of two vectors. The Canberra, binary
and Minkowski distance measures are also available in NbClust
(Seber 2009).

NbClust can be run on a range of cluster numbers, choos-
ing from the measures and methods described above, while clus-
ter validity is assessed using the validity indices. Cluster va-
lidity (evaluating the quality of clusters, optimizing the num-
ber of clusters derived) can be described using three diﬀerent
approaches (Theodoridis & Koutroumbas 2006): external crite-
ria (comparing the results to externally provided classes or la-
bels), internal criteria (the information obtained within the clus-
tering process is used to evaluate how well the results ﬁt the
data) and relative criteria (compares the results with other clus-
tering schemes resulting by the same algorithm but with dif-
ferent parameters). Most of the validity measures determined
for the third approach (Milligan & Cooper 1985; Dunn 1974;
Rousseeuw 1987) were incorporated in the NbClust package.
The validity indices combine information about within-cluster
compactness, between-cluster isolation and other geometric or
statistical properties of the data, the number of elements and dis-
tance measures. See Charrad et al. (2014) and references therein
for the detailed description of NbClust and the deﬁnitions of dis-
tance measures, linkage criteria and cluster validity indices.
