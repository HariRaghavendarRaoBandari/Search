ABSTRACT
We study the eﬀect of f (R) gravity on the statistical properties of various large-scale
structures which can be probed in weak gravitational lensing measurements. A set of
ray-tracing simulations of gravitational lensing in f (R) gravity enables us to explore
cosmological information on (i) stacking analyses of weak lensing observables and (ii)
peak statistics in reconstructed lensing mass maps. For the f (R) model proposed by
Hu & Sawicki, the measured lensing signals of dark matter haloes in the stacking
analysis would show a <∼ 10% diﬀerence between the standard ΛCDM and the f (R)
model when the additional degree of freedom in f (R) model would be |fR0| ∼ 10−5.
Among various large-scale structures to be studied in stacking analysis, troughs, i.e,
underdensity regions in projected plane of foreground massive haloes, could be promis-
ing to constrain the model with |fR0| ∼ 10−5, while stacking analysis around voids is
found to be diﬃcult to improve the constraint of |fR0| even in future lensing surveys
with a sky coverage of ∼ 1000 square degrees. On the peak statistics, we conﬁrm the
correspondence between local maxima and dark matter haloes along the line of sight,
regardless of the modiﬁcation of gravity in our simulation. Thus, the number count
of high signiﬁcance local maxima would be useful to probe the mass function of dark
matter haloes even in the f (R) model with |fR0| <∼ 10−5. We also ﬁnd that including
local minima in lensing mass maps would be helpful to improve the constant on f (R)
gravity down to |fR0| = 10−5 in ongoing weak lensing surveys.

1 INTRODUCTION

The standard cosmological model called ΛCDM model has been established by various astronomical observations such as
measure of distance to supernovae, spatial distribution of galaxies and cosmic microwave background (e.g., Perlmutter et al.
1997; Tegmark et al. 2006; Planck Collaboration et al. 2015). Although the ΛCDM model is consistent with observational
results within the statistical uncertainty, the physical origin of accelerating expansion of the Universe is still uncertain. At

present, there exist two physical models to explain the cosmic acceleration at redshift of z <∼ 1: dynamical dark energy model

and modiﬁed gravity theory. The former would realize the accelerating expansion of the Universe within the theory of general
relativity by introducing unknown energy, while the latter does not require an exotic form of energy but modify the basic
equation of gravitational action. In order to distinguish these two scenarios, the measurement of gravitational growth of cosmic
matter density would be essential because the modiﬁcation of gravity could induce some speciﬁc features in matter density
distribution in the Universe.

Vainshtein (Vainshtein 1972) or chameleon mechanisms (Khoury & Weltman 2004a,b; Brax et al. 2004) are among the
most interesting features in modiﬁed gravity theory, which would guarantee the success of general relativity in the solar
system. However, modiﬁcation of gravity can aﬀect the evolution of matter density distribution on extragalactic scales. For

instance, several N -body simulations indicate the modiﬁcation of gravity would aﬀect properties of group or cluster-sized haloes
(Li & Hu 2011; Arnold et al. 2014; Hammami et al. 2015). In particular, the recent simulation in Achitouv et al. (2015) showed
that matter densities of haloes at central regions can increase up to 40% in some cases. Furthermore, the modiﬁcation should
give prominent eﬀects on low density regions such as cosmic voids in which screening mechanisms do not work. Therefore,
the diﬀerences of properties in low density regions have been investigated in previous numerical simulations (Li et al. 2012a;
Zivick et al. 2015; Achitouv et al. 2015). N -body simulations of modiﬁed gravity showed that the number count of voids
deﬁned in the spatial distribution of haloes would be about 2 times smaller than that in general relativity, while the matter
density around voids would show a diﬀerence with a level of a few percent (Cai et al. 2015). While numerical simulations
have been advanced of understanding the statistical properties of cosmic matter density in modiﬁed gravity, some of those
properties in simulations are based on three-dimensional matter density distribution and thus cannot be observed in actual
observations directly. Therefore, it is important to investigate how the imprint of modiﬁed gravity on cosmic matter density
would appear in real observables. Among various observables, we would focus on weak gravitational lensing eﬀect on galaxies
in imaging surveys.

Gravitational lensing is an unbiased probe of the matter distribution in the Universe. Small image distortions of distant
galaxies are caused by intervening mass distribution. Small distortion caused by the large-scale structure of the Universe is
called cosmic shear. It contains, in principle, rich information on the matter distribution at small and large scales and the
evolution over time. Image distortion induced by gravitational lensing is, however, very small in general. Therefore, we need
statistical analyses of the cosmic shear signal by sampling a large number of distant galaxies in order to extract cosmological
information from gravitational lensing. Ongoing and future galaxy imaging surveys are aimed at measuring projected matter
distribution over several thousand square degrees and the averaged matter distribution around possible large-scale structures
such as galaxies, galaxy clusters and cosmic voids. Clearly, we need to understand the relation between cosmic matter density
and the lensing observables when examining the modiﬁed gravity with galaxy imaging surveys.

In this paper, we perform ray-tracing simulation of gravitational lensing in the modiﬁed gravity and explore the relation
between large-scale structures and the lensing observables in galaxy imaging surveys under the modiﬁcation of gravity. In
comparison with the recent study in Tessore et al. (2015), we properly take into account the deﬂection of light ray along the
line of sight in our gravitational lensing simulations. We consider the two observables to reveal the matter density distribution
in the Universe with weak gravitational lensing: the stacked lensing signals around various large-scale structures and the peak
statistics on reconstructed mass distribution from cosmic shear. The former observables are related with the average matter
density distribution around dark matter haloes and cosmic voids. In addition, we also focus on the peak statistics to extract
cosmological information on the abundance of large-scale structures.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the cosmological model is described. In Section 3, we summarize basics of
weak lensing and analysis methods used in this paper. We also explain details of our lensing simulation and the deﬁnition of
large-scale structures in Section 4. In Section 5, we provide results of our lensing analysis in numerical simulation of modiﬁed
gravity and compare the results of modiﬁed gravity model and the ΛCDM model in detail. Conclusions and discussions are
summarized in Section 6.

2 COSMOLOGICAL MODEL

There exist various extensions to the standard ΛCDM model. Here, we consider competing models called f (R) models, which

represents cosmological models with modiﬁed gravity. This model can explain the observed cosmic acceleration at z <∼ 1 and

satisfy the solar system tests with appropriate parameters. Throughout this paper, we assume a spatially ﬂat universe and
adopt the cosmological parameters which follow the result with Planck satellite (Planck Collaboration et al. 2015): matter
density Ωm0 = 0.315, dark energy density ΩΛ0 = 0.685, Hubble parameter h = 0.673 and the scalar spectral index ns = 0.945.

f(R) model

In f (R) model, the Einstein-Hilbert action is modiﬁed by a general function of the scalar curvature R (Nojiri & Odintsov
2011; Li et al. 2012b; Shi et al. 2015),

The action with Eq. (1) leads the modiﬁed Einstein equation as

where fR ≡ df /dR, Gµν ≡ Rµν − 1/2gµν R and (cid:3) ≡ ∇α∇α. Assuming a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metric, one
can determine the time evolution of the Hubble parameter in f (R) model as follows:

One can also consider the evolution of matter density perturbations in f (R) model. For sub-horizon modes (k >∼ aH) in

the quasi-static limit 1, the linear growth of matter density perturbation is determined by (e.g., Bean et al. 2007)

where Hf (R) is given by Eq. (3). Note that ˜Ω and ˜wDE are equivalent to ΛCDM model for small |fR0|. The function Q in
Eq. (4) is given by

Q(k, a) = −2(cid:18) k

(6)

Note that the function of Q induces the non-trivial scale dependence of the linear growth rate g+(k, a) = D(k, a)/a in f (R)
model, while the linear growth rate is exactly a function of a in General Relativity.

In this paper, we will consider the representative example of f (R) models as proposed in Hu & Sawicki (2007) (hereafter

denoted as HS model),

f (R) = −2Λ

Rn

Rn + µ2n ,

where Λ, µ and n are free parameters in this model. For R ≫ µ2, one can approximate the function of f (R) as follows:

(8)

where ¯R0 is deﬁned by the present scalar curvature of the background space-time and fR0 = −2Λµ2/ ¯R2
0 = fR( ¯R0). In the
HS model with |fR0| ≪ 1, the background expansion would be almost equivalent to one in ΛCDM model. In practice, for
|fR0| ≪ 10−2, geometric tests such as distance measurement with supernovae could not distinguish between the HS model and
the ΛCDM model (Martinelli et al. 2012). Nevertheless, measurements of gravitational growth would be helpful to constrain
on HS model due to the scale dependence of growth rate as shown in Eq. (4). Furthermore, the non-linear gravitational growth
in the HS model have been studied with cosmological N -body simulations (Oyaizu et al. 2008; Schmidt et al. 2009; He et al.
2013; Zhao 2014). Such previous works indicate that statistics of galaxy groups or clusters provide meaningful information
about the modiﬁcation of gravity. Therefore, combination of statistics between weak lensing and galaxy clusters are among
the interesting probes of the HS model. In the following, we focus on the case of n = 1.

3 WEAK LENSING

3.1 Basics

We here summarize basics of weak gravitational lensing eﬀects. When considering the observed position of a source object as
θ and the true position as β, one can characterize the distortion of image of a source object by the following 2D matrix

Aij =

∂βi

∂θj ≡  1 − κ − γ1
−γ2 − ω

1 − κ + γ1 ! ,
−γ2 − ω

(9)

where κ is convergence, γ is shear and ω is rotation.

Let us consider the case of General Relativity. One can relate each component of Aij to the second derivative of the

gravitational potential as follows (Bartelmann & Schneider 2001)
Aij = δij − Φij ,

1 de La Cruz-Dombriz et al. (2008); Bose et al. (2015) have shown that the quasi-static approximation becomes quite reasonable for
models with |fR| ≪ 1 today.

where χ is the comoving distance and r(χ) represents the comoving angular diameter distance. Gravitational potential Φ
can be related to matter density perturbation δ through Poisson equation. Therefore, convergence can be expressed as the
weighted integral of δ along the line of sight

κ =Z χs

0

Wκ(χ, χs)δ,

where χs is comoving distance to source galaxies and Wκ(χ) is the lensing weight function deﬁned as

Wκ(χ, χs) =

c (cid:19)2
2 (cid:18) H0

Ωm0 q(χs, χ)(1 + z(χ)).

(13)

(14)

In general, the lensing equation would be governed by so-called lensing potential (Φ + Ψ)/2 where Φ and Ψ are the Bardeen
potentials appeared in metric perturbation in the Newtonian gauge. The lensing potential in f (R) gravity would be governed
by the Poisson equation in General relativity, making Eqs. (10), (11) and (13) available in the HS model with |fR0| ≪ 1.
Therefore, equations for gravitational lensing in f (R) gravity become the same as in general relativity (Arnold et al. 2014).

3.2 Statistical Analysis

While reduced shear gi = γi/(1−κ) can be estimated from the ellipticity of galaxy (e.g., Schneider & Seitz 1995; Bartelmann & Schneider
2001), the intrinsic shape would be dominated in the measured ellipticity of individual galaxy in typical ground-based imaging
surveys. Therefore, we need to perform statistical analyses with a large number of source galaxies. Here, we introduce two
statistical methods to study the large-scale structures with weak lensing measurement.

3.2.1 Stacked lensing

Stacking analysis of weak lensing observables is a powerful method to study the average matter density distribution around
an object of interest.

For a given tracer of large-scale structures (LSS), we deﬁne a stacked signal as

where nLSS represents the number density of the tracer. The stacked signal can be related to the surface excess of convergence
as (Bartelmann & Schneider 2001)

hγ+i(θ) = hnLSS(φ)γ+(θ + φ)i,

(15)

where hκi denotes the azimuthal average proﬁle of convergence and ¯κ(θ) is a mean convergence value within a circular aperture
of radius θ deﬁned as

hγ+i(θ) = ¯κ(θ) − hκi(θ),

(16)

¯κ(θ) =

1

πθ2 Zφ<θ

d2φ κ(φ).

(17)

In order to constrain on the nature of gravity with LSS, it is essential to study the lower density regions in the Universe.
Since any modiﬁed gravity theories should pass the existing robust tests of General relativity in the solar system or the
high density region in the Universe, an extra ﬁfth force in the modiﬁed gravity model might be weak but not completely
disappeared. Therefore, the matter density distribution in the Universe would be aﬀected by the ﬁfth force in more eﬃcient
way at lower density regions (e.g., Li et al. 2012a; Clampitt et al. 2013; Cai et al. 2015). Also, the matter ﬂuctuation at linear
scales can be a promising target to seek for the signature of modiﬁcation of general relativity because the linear growth rate
would be dependent on the length scale as shown in Eq. (4). The linear growth rate can be measured by stacked signals around
galaxies or clusters of galaxies at large angular separations (e.g., Oguri & Takada 2011).

Hence, we consider three tracers of LSS, named voids, troughs, and haloes in the present paper. Voids are commonly
deﬁned by empty regions or extremely low density regions in the Universe. Gruen et al. (2016) has recently proposed a new
tracer of low density regions in the Universe, which is called trough. Troughs are deﬁned as underdense regions in the projected
galaxy distributions. Under the assumption that galaxy would be the biased tracer of matter distribution in a three-dimensional
space, troughs would be an eﬀective tracer of matter density distributions with δ < 0. Haloes are the counterpart of voids,

showing the high contrast of matter density with the typical value of δ >∼ 100. We examine whether the stacked signal around

voids or troughs (the tracers of underdensity regions) can be aﬀected by the extra ﬁfth force in f (R) model. On the other
hand, we study the stacked signals around haloes at large scales to explore the scale-dependency of linear growth rate. In the
following, we summarize the model of stacked lensing signal around haloes, voids and troughs.

Haloes

We here describe the model of the lensing observable hγ+i around dark matter haloes. Let us suppose that a density proﬁle
of a host halo is described by the universal NFW proﬁle (Navarro et al. 1997),

ρh(r) =

ρs

(r/rs)(1 + r/rs)2 ,

(18)

where ρs and rs are a scale density and a scale radius, respectively. The parameters ρs and rs can be essentially convolved into
one parameter, the concentration cvir(M, z), by the use of two halo mass relations; namely, Mvir = 4πr3
vir∆vir(z)ρcrit(z)/3,
where rvir is a virial radius corresponding to the overdensity criterion ∆vir(z) (as shown in, e.g., Navarro et al. 1997), and

Mvir =R dV ρh(ρs, rs) with the integral performed out to rvir. In this paper, we adopt the functional form of the concentration

parameter in Dutton & Macci`o (2014),

log10 cvir(M, z) = 0.537 + 0.488 exp(cid:0)−0.718z1.08(cid:1) + (−0.097 + 0.024z) log10(cid:18)

For a given halo sample with the mass range of Mmin < M < Mmax and the redshift range of zmin < z < zmax, one can

(19)

ﬁnd stacked signals around dark matter haloes are expressed as (e.g., Marian et al. 2015)

where Phκ(ℓ) represents the halo-convergence cross power spectrum and J2(x) is the second-order Bessel function. In this
paper, we apply the halo-model approach to model Phκ. As follows in Oguri & Takada (2011); Shirasaki et al. (2016), the
halo-convergence cross power spectrum spectrum is given by

(24)

In the case of the standard ΛCDM model, we adopt the model of halo mass function and linear halo bias with the overdensity
of ∆ = 200 developed in Tinker et al. (2008, 2010). To remain consistent with our calculation, we convert the mass of the
host halo using the deﬁnition of ∆ as shown in Hu & Kravtsov (2003).

Voids

We next consider stacked lensing signals around voids. For the standard ΛCDM model, dark matter density proﬁle of voids have
been investigated in previous studies (e.g. Sheth & van de Weygaert 2004; Pan et al. 2012). Both theoretical and observational
studies have indicated that a matter density would be almost constant over an underdense region and there exists a very
sharp spike called a ridge at the edge of voids. These features are found in the N -body simulation of f (R) gravity but the
inner proﬁle of voids would be aﬀected by the modiﬁcation of gravity (e.g. Cai et al. 2015).

In order to make a simple void model which includes the properties found in the previous works, we consider a spherically
symmetric void model called a double top-hat model (Higuchi et al. 2013). In this model, mass density of a given void is
expressed as

ρ1
ρ2

(r ≤ R1)
(R1 < r ≤ R2)
(R2 < r)

(25)

ρv(r) =


where r is a distance from the center of void, ρ1 and ρ2 are constant in each region. Assumed that the total mass between the
void region (r ≤ R1) and the ridge region (R1 < r ≤ R2) should be compensated each other, the density contrast of void is
given by

where χl is the comoving distance to void, θi is deﬁned by Ri/χl and Θ(x) represents the Heaviside step function.

Troughs

Troughs have been recently proposed in Gruen et al. (2016) as tracers of underdense regions in the Universe. In this paper,
we deﬁne the trough with a given dark matter halo catalog. Let us consider a halo catalog with the selection function of
Whalo(z, M ). For a given Whalo, the three-dimensional number density of haloes is deﬁned by

Nhalo

where Nhalo represents the total number of haloes in the ﬁeld of view. In this paper, we simply consider the functional form
of Whalo(z, M ) as

where WT(x) is the weighted function to construct the smoothed density ﬁeld and set to be the top-hat function as

where θT represents the radius of the ﬁlter function. In the following, we call θT as trough radius. The positions of troughs
are then selected by the points below the α-th percentile Gα of the distribution of G(θ).

As shown in the above selection of troughs, the statistical property of troughs would be governed by the new random

ﬁeld as

δT(θ) =Z d2θ′WT(|θ − θ′|)δΣ,h(θ′),

where δΣ,h represents the contrast of the projected number density of haloes. Assumed that the probability P of ﬁnding N
haloes at a given position of θ can be determined by the value of δT(θ), we can identify the expectation value of δT for a
given N as

where p(δT|N ) represents the conditional probability distribution function of δT for a given N . Note that the Bayes’ theorem
tells

hδT|Ni =Z ∞

Therefore, the maximum number of haloes within trough radius Nmax should be determined by

• The three-dimensional halo density ﬁeld nhalo,3D can be described as a deterministic, biased tracer of the matter density
ﬁeld. This means that the projected matter density contrast δΣ within the redshift range of the halo catalog is equivalent to
δΣ,h.

• The random ﬁeld δT(θ) and the convergence ﬁeld κ(θ) follow a Gaussian distribution.
• The probability of P (N|δT) is given by a biased Poisson process with the halo bias of ¯b.

Under these assumptions, we can calculate the azimuthally averaged convergence proﬁle around troughs. Let Ki to be the
average of convergence ﬁeld over a distance of θ = [θi, θi+1] from the trough center, i.e.,

where Ai represents the i-th annuli around the trough. The average Ki over the position of troughs is then given by

Reconstruction of smoothed convergence

In addition to stacked lensing, weak lensing provides a physical method to reconstruct the projected matter density ﬁeld. The
reconstruction is commonly based on the smoothed map of cosmic shear. Let us ﬁrst deﬁne the smoothed convergence map as

where U is the ﬁlter function to be speciﬁed below. We can calculate the same quantity by smoothing the shear ﬁeld γ as

where γ+ is the tangential component of the shear at position φ relative to the point θ. The ﬁlter function for the shear ﬁeld
Q+ is related to U by

for θ ≤ θo and U = Q+ = 0 elsewhere. Throughout this paper, we adopt θG = 1 arcmin and θo = 10 arcmin. Note that this
choice of θG is considered to be an optimal smoothing scale for the detection of massive galaxy clusters using weak lensing for
zsource = 1.0 (Hamana et al. 2004).

The local maxima or minima found in a smoothed convergence map would have cosmological information originated from
massive dark matter haloes, voids, and the superposition of large scale structures (e.g., Hamana et al. 2004; Dietrich & Hartlap
2010; Kratochvil et al. 2010; Yang et al. 2011; Shirasaki et al. 2016). In this paper, we deﬁne peaks in the convergence map
by ﬁnding the local maxima or minima. Peak height is in practice normalized as ν(θ) = K(θ)/σshape where σshape is the noise
variance coming from intrinsic ellipticity of galaxies. We estimate σshape as follows

where σe is the rms value of intrinsic ellipticity of galaxies and ngal is the number density of galaxies. We assume σe = 0.4
and ngal = 30 arcmin−2 which are typical values for ground-based imaging surveys.

High signiﬁcance local maxima and their abundance

On a smoothed lensing map, local maxima with high signal-to-noise ratio would be likely caused by galaxy clusters (Hamana et al.
2004). We thus locate high-ν local maxima on a convergence map and associate each of them with an isolated massive halo
along the line of sight. Supposed that the universal NFW density proﬁle (Eq. 18), we can calculate the convergence proﬁle κh
for a given halo analytically (Hamana et al. 2004).

In order to predict peak heights in a convergence map, we adopt the simple assumption that each peak position is exactly

at the halo center. Under this assumption, the peak height in absence of shape noise is given by

Kpeak,h =Z d2φ U (φ; θG, θo)κh(φ).

(46)

The actual peak height on a noisy convergence map is determined not by Eq. (46), but by a probability distribution function
(Fan et al. 2010). The probability distribution function of the measured peak height Kpeak,obs with a given Kpeak,h is denoted
by Prob(Kpeak,obs|Kpeak,h) in this paper. The detailed functional form of Prob(Kpeak,obs|Kpeak,h) is found in Shirasaki et al.
(2015).

We identify local maxima in a smoothed lensing map and match each peak with a massive dark matter halo along the
line of sight. The simple peak count is useful to extract the information of the abundance of massive clusters. One can select
the lensing peaks by its peak height. For a given threshold of peak height νthre, one can predict the surface number density
of peaks with ν > νthre as follows (Hamana et al. 2004):

4 SIMULATION

In order to study the relation of weak lensing statistics with the underlying large-scale structures, we perform the ray-tracing
simulation of gravitational lensing with a set of N -body simulations.

4.1 N -body and Ray-tracing simulations

We ﬁrst run a N -body simulation to generate a three-dimensional matter density ﬁeld. We use the adaptive mesh reﬁnement
code ECOSMOG for a wide class of modiﬁed gravity (Li et al. 2012b). The simulation volume has a comoving box length of
240 h−1Mpc, resolved using a uniform 5123 root grid and 7 levels of mesh reﬁnement, implying a maximum comoving spatial
resolution of 3.6 h−1kpc. We proceed the mesh reﬁnement when the eﬀective particle number in a grid cell would be larger
than 8. The density assignment and force interpolation in a cell is performed by the triangular shaped cloud (TSC) method.
We generate the initial conditions using a parallel code mpgrafic developed by Prunet et al. (2008). The initial redshift is set
to zinit = 85, where we compute the linear matter transfer function using linger (Bertschinger 1995). In simulations, we adopt
the following cosmological parameters : matter density Ωm0 = 0.315, dark energy density ΩΛ0 = 0.685, Hubble parameter
h = 0.673 and the scalar spectral index ns = 0.945. For the HS model, we consider two models with |fR0| = 10−5 and 10−6,
referred as F5 and F6, respectively. Note that we can safely set ˜wDE = −1 and ∇(Ψ + Φ)/2 = 4πG¯ρmδa2 in the model with
|fR0| ≪ 1.

For ray-tracing simulations of gravitational lensing, we generate light-cone outputs using multiple simulation boxes in the
following manner. Our simulations are placed to cover the past light-cone of a hypothetical observer with an angular extent
5◦ × 5◦, from z = 0 to 1, similar to the methods in White & Hu (2000),Hamana & Mellier (2001), and Sato et al. (2009).
Details of the conﬁguration are found in the last reference. The angular grid size of our maps is 5◦/4096 ∼ 0.075 arcmin.
For a given cosmological model, we ﬁrst store particle data of N -body simulation at various redshifts. We then randomly
shift the simulation boxes in order to avoid the same structure appearing multiple times along a line-of-sight. In total, we
generate 100 independent lensing maps with the source redshift of zsource = 1 from our N -body simulation. Figure 1 shows
an example of our simulated convergence map for diﬀerent cosmological models. Although it is diﬃcult to distinguish with
three models by eyes, the lensing statistics would enable us to clarify the diﬀerences among these. In Figure 2, we compare
the convergence power spectrum for three cosmological models. The points with error bar represent the simulation results for
the ΛCDM model and the HS model with |fR0| = 10−5 and 10−6. The green and blue solid lines correspond to the theoretical
model of convergence power spectrum for the case of |fR0| = 10−5 and 10−6, respectively. Under the Limber approximation

power spectrum over 100 realizations of lensing maps. The coloured solid line represents the theoretical model of power spectrum with
the ﬁtting formula of the non-linear matter power spectrum (Zhao 2014). In the bottom panel, we show the diﬀerence between the HS
model and the ﬁducial ΛCDM model obtained from our simulation. In both panels, the error bar corresponds to the standard deviation
of the mean estimated from 100 maps.

(Limber 1954; Kaiser 1992) and Eq. (13), one can calculate the convergence power spectrum as

with previous modiﬁed gravity simulations.

haloes

In each output of the N -body simulation, we locate dark matter haloes using the standard friend-of-friend (FOF) algorithm
with the linking parameter of b = 0.2. We deﬁne the mass of each halo by the spherical overdensity mass with ∆ = 200, which
is denoted by M200. The position of each halo is deﬁned by the position of the particle located at the potential maximum in
each FOF group. In the following analysis, we use haloes with a mass M200 greater than 1013h−1M⊙. Using the FOF haloes,

MNRAS 000, 1–?? (2016)

10

Y.Higuchi et al.

we construct mock group catalogs on the light cone by arranging the simulation outputs in the same manner as the ray-tracing
simulation. We mark the positions of the haloes in the lensing map. In summary, our mock catalogs contain data about the
masses, redshifts, and angular positions on the lensing map for the haloes.

Voids

In order to deﬁne void in each realization, we employ the public code Void Finder (Foster & Nelson 2009) on the void ﬁnding
algorithm developed by Hoyle & Vogeley (2004) and Hoyle et al. (2005). It ﬁnds small number density regions of haloes and
make spheres. Then, radius of those spheres are enlarged and spheres are marginalized with marginalization criteria. We adopt
the same parameters found in Foster & Nelson (2009) except for the minimum radius ξ. We use ξ = 10 Mpc as the minimum
radius of voids. The number count of voids does not strongly depend on this value for voids whose radius are more than
15 Mpc (Higuchi et al. 2013). When running the Void Finder, we use haloes at 0.15 ≤ z ≤ 0.65 with masses larger than
M200 ≥ 1013 h−1M⊙. In order to select legitimate voids, we select voids whose centers are more than the eﬀective radius of
voids away from the edges of simulation boxes.

Troughs

In this paper, we deﬁne trough as centers of cylindrical regions with low number density of haloes as summarized in Sec-
tion 3.2.1. In order to deﬁne positions of troughs, we count the number count in each cylinder G(θ) and then select the set
of trough positions as the points below the 20th percentile of the distribution of G(θ). In our study, we estimate the number
count for the circles spaced by 0.75 arcmin. For the selection, we set zmin = 0.2 and zhigh = 0.6, while we examine the three
mass threshold cases for MT = 1013h−1M⊙, 5 × 1013h−1M⊙ and 1014h−1M⊙. Furthermore, we study the dependence of the
trough radius on our results by considering θT = 5, 10, 20 and 30 arcmin.

5 RESULTS

In the following, we summarize the results on our lensing analyses with 100 ray-tracing simulations.

5.1 Stacked Lensing

5.1.1 haloes

We perform the stacked analysis around haloes by selecting their masses and redshifts. We consider the three redshift bins of
0.1 ≤ z ≤ 0.3, 0.3 ≤ z ≤ 0.5, and 0.5 ≤ z ≤ 0.7 and three mass bins of 1013h−1M⊙ ≤ M200 < 1013.5h−1M⊙, 1013.5h−1M⊙ ≤
M200 < 1014h−1M⊙ and 1014h−1M⊙ ≤ M200 < 1015h−1M⊙. In the stacking analysis, we measure the azimuthally averaged,
logarithmically spaced radial proﬁle of tangential shear in the radial range of θ = 1 − 100 arcmin around the center of each
cluster and then stack the shear proﬁles over the haloes found in each realization. The typical number of haloes in the stacking
analysis ranges from 40 to 2000 in each realization.

We start to compare the result obtained from 100 simulations for ΛCDM with the halo model as in Section 3.2.1. The
left panel in Figure 3 summarizes the stacked tangential shear proﬁles in each mass and redshift bin. The black point in the
left panel corresponds to the average values of tangential shear over 100 realizations and the error bar represents the standard
deviation of the average tangential shear (i.e. the standard deviation over 100 realizations divided by √100). We also show the
theoretical model as shown in Section 3.2.1 by the red lines. We have conﬁrmed that our simulation results for the standard
ΛCDM model are in good agreement with the halo model prediction for the range of θ = 1 − 100 arcmin.

We then consider the comparison of tangential shear between f (R) gravity and ΛCDM. In order to clarify the diﬀerences,
we introduce the ratio of tangential shear between two cases. The right panel in Figure 3 shows the ratio of tangential shear
over three mass and redshift bins. In the right panel, the red line corresponds to the ratio between the F5 model and ΛCDM,
while the green line is for the F6 model. The gray error bars in the right panel represent the standard deviation of tangential
shear for |fR0| = 0. According to the right panel in Figure 3, there are found no diﬀerences between the stacked signal for the
F6 and ΛCDM model over the wide range of halo masses and redshifts. On the other hand, the diﬀerences from the ΛCDM
model are clearly found in the case of the F5 model. Interestingly, we ﬁnd the signiﬁcant deviation of the stacked signal at
θ ≤ θ200, where θ200 is the corresponding angular radius of R200 = (3M200/4π 200¯ρm)1/3. This eﬀect might be caused by
the diﬀerent mass assembly history in f (R) cosmology from the standard model, although the further investigation would
be required. Note that the recent numerical study has reported that f (R) gravity would induce the changes of the three-
dimensional halo density proﬁle (Zhao et al. 2011; Achitouv et al. 2015), while mass-concentration relation in F6 are found to
be negligible for haloes with masses larger than 1013 h−1M⊙ for all redshift (Shi et al. 2015). We also ﬁnd that the stacked
signal at the transition scale between the one-halo and two halo terms would be aﬀected by the modiﬁcation of gravity. The

corresponding halo-model prediction as shown in Section 3.2.1. The two red dashed lines are the one-halo and two-halo terms, respectively.
Right: The comparison of results with f (R) gravity and ΛCDM. The each panel shows the ratio of stacked signal between the case of
f (R) gravity and ΛCDM model. The red line shows the case of |fR0| = 10−5, while the green one is for |fR0| = 10−6. The gray error
bars represent the standard devotion of ensemble average of stacked signals over 100 realizations.

trend of eﬀects of f (R) gravity on stacked proﬁle shows the complex dependences of the halo masses and redshifts. We have
conﬁrmed that the three-dimensional halo density proﬁle ρh shows the similar trend as shown in Figure 3 when we stacked ρh
for each halo mass and redshift bin, i.e., more concentrated halo proﬁle tends to make the tangential shear larger at θ <∼ θ200

and vice versa.

5.1.2 Voids

We next consider the stacked signals around voids. In the stacked analysis, we divide the voids by their radius obtained from
the Void Finder. We consider two radius bins of 20 − 30 h−1Mpc and 30 − 40 h−1Mpc. Note that the total number of voids
over 100 realizations is found to be ∼ 1000. This means that we can ﬁnd only ∼ 10 voids in each realization. Since the stacked
signals over ∼ 10 voids are quite weak, it is diﬃcult to discuss the impact of f (R) gravity on the stacked signals for each
25 deg2. Therefore, we decide to measure the stacked signal using all voids in 100 realizations. The error bars of the stacked
signals at the angular separation of θ are simply estimated by summing up the error which obtained from void proﬁles and
LSS, and shape noise

where Nstack represents the number of objects used for stacked analysis and ∆θ is the bin size of angular separation. σvoid and
σLSS are errors from dark matter distributions around voids and large-scale structure on the line of sight, which are estimated
from a covariance matrix with Eq.(11) in Higuchi et al. (2013). We here consider the 25 bins of angular separation in the
range of 0-200 arcmin with ∆θ = 8 arcmin.

Figure 4 shows the results of void stacking in each void radius bin as a function of distance from a center of a void.
The error bar shown in this ﬁgure corresponds to the statistical uncertainty for a 2500 deg2 survey. Clearly, it is diﬃcult to
ﬁnd any eﬀects on f (R) gravity on the stacked signals around voids. In order to evaluate the proﬁle quantitively, we ﬁt the
proﬁles with void model as shown in Section 3.2.1. Table 1 shows the results of ﬁtting with the double top-hat model. The
1σ uncertainty of ﬁtting parameters in Table 1 are estimated with boot strap method. We select voids randomly, stack and
measure the stacked proﬁle over selected voids. We then make 100 stacked proﬁles for a given void radius bin and calculate
the standard deviation over 100 proﬁles. We perform the proﬁle ﬁtting by using Eq. (27) with three ﬁtting parameters: density
contrast of a void δ1, size of a void θ1 and size of a ridge θ2. In the ﬁtting, lens redshift is set to be zl = 0.4. We cannot ﬁnd
signiﬁcant diﬀerence between estimated parameters, indicating that proﬁles are same within errors.

Cai et al. (2015) ﬁnds that stacking voids can constrain f (R) gravity down to F5 with a Gpc scale survey. In our analysis,

on the other hand, it is diﬃcult to ﬁnd large diﬀerences between cosmological models for each size of voids. This discrepancy
mainly comes from the diﬀerence between stacking methods and the number of voids used in the stacking analysis. They use
more than 104 voids for the stacking while we only use 103 voids at most. When their errors are scaled with the number of
voids used in this paper, the errors are increased by more than three times. Therefore, one can not distinguish the proﬁles
between f (R) and ΛCDM when also using their simulation. This result is consistent with our result which includes more
realistic eﬀects by using ray-tracing simulations As a result, stacked void lensing is a promising tool for giving constraint on
f (R) in future large-scale survey. However, larger surveys such as LSST (Ivezic et al. 2008) are required.

5.1.3 Troughs

In this section, we evaluate the eﬀects of f (R) gravity on the stacked signal around troughs. We estimate the error bars of
tangential shear by the standard deviation over 100 realizations and take into account the contribution from shape noise by
using third term in Eq. (50). Note that the errors represent the uncertainty with the sky coverage of 25 square degrees.

We ﬁrst compare the simulation results in the ΛCDM model with the theoretical model in Gruen et al. (2016). Figure 5
summarizes the results in the case of the halo catalog with the mass threshold of MT = 1013 h−1M⊙. We consider the four
cases of trough radius θT = 5, 10, 20 and 30 arcmin. The black point in Figure 5 represents the average stacked signals hγ+i
over 100 realizations, while the red line corresponds to the theoretical model. We ﬁnd that the model in Gruen et al. (2016)
provides the reasonable ﬁt to the simulation results for MT = 1013 h−1M⊙ and diﬀerent four trough radiuses. However,
the measured signals around troughs would be strongly aﬀected by the selection criteria of halo masses. Figure 6 shows the
dependence of MT on the stacked signals around the troughs in the case of ΛCDM. The left panel in Figure 6 summarizes
the results of hγ+i in the case of θT = 5 arcmin, while the right one corresponds to the average convergence proﬁle hκi. We
ﬁnd that the expected proﬁles as shown in Gruen et al. (2016) are observed only when we set to be MT = 1013 h−1M⊙ in
our simulations. Convergence proﬁles with large halo mass criteria tend to show positive values while this trend appears for
lower mass selection criteria. This might be caused by the presence of massive halos with mass of M < MT in a trough radius.
However, this eﬀect is found to be smaller as the trough radius increases.

represents the theoretical model as proposed in Gruen et al. (2016).

proﬁle, Right: convergence proﬁle.

We then consider the imprint of f (R) gravity on the stacked signals around troughs. Figure 7 shows the stacked tangential
shear proﬁles for the ΛCDM and two f (R) models. As seen in this ﬁgure, we can ﬁnd the diﬀerences of hγ+i at θ ∼ θT between
the F5 model and ΛCDM model when using the troughs with θT = 5 arcmin and the halo catalogs with MT = 1013 h−1M⊙. In
order to deﬁne the signiﬁcance with the more quantitive manner, we introduce the signiﬁcance level of the diﬀerence between
the two models of tangential shear proﬁle γ+,(a) and γ+,(b) for each bin as follows:

where σ represents the statistical uncertainty in stacked analysis for a given sky coverage. In order to calculate Eq. (51) for
the troughs with θT = 5 arcmin and MT = 1013 h−1M⊙, we consider 23 bins in the range of 1-150 arcmin and compute the
standard deviation of stacked signals over 100 ΛCDM simulations. We then use this standard deviation as the estimator of
σ in a 25 deg2 sky. Assumed that σ would be scaled with survey area, we ﬁnd that the signal-to-noise ratio between the F5
model and ΛCDM model would be 1.43 for each bin in a sky coverage of 1,400 deg2 as proposed in the ongoing Subaru/Hyper
Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey (Miyazaki et al. 2006). Therefore, we conclude that the stacked signal around troughs can be
useful to distinguish the f (R) model with |fR0| = 10−5 and the standard ΛCDM model with a ∼ 2σ level in the ongoing

ΛCDM model over 100 realizations for a set of MT and θT, except for the case of θT = 5 arcmin and MT = 1013 h−1M⊙.
Moreover, we cannot ﬁnd any signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the stacked proﬁle around troughs in the F6 model and the
ΛCDM model in our simulations.

5.2 Peak Statisitcs

In this section, we simulate galaxy shape noise in our simulation by adding the shape noise to shear from random ellipticities
which follow the two-dimensional Gaussian distribution as

5.2.1 Peak-Halo matching

We ﬁrst examine the correspondence between dark matter haloes and the local maximum in smoothed convergence map.
With our ray-tracing simulations and mock halo catalogs, we study the correspondence between haloes and the peaks in
weak lensing convergence maps. We ﬁrst identify the local maxima in the smoothed convergence ﬁeld with source redshift
of zsource = 1. For selection of peaks, the threshold of peak height is set to be K = 0.04 for noise-less maps and 0.06 for
noisy maps. These value correspond to ∼ 3σ in smoothed convergence maps without and with noise, respectively. For a given
position of lensing peak, we search for the matched dark matter haloes within a radius of 3 arcmin from the peak position.
This search radius is set to be larger than the smoothing scale but still smaller than the angular size of massive haloes at
z ∼ 0.1 − 0.7 (also see, Hamana et al. 2004). When we ﬁnd several haloes in search radius, we regard the matched halo as
the closest halo from the position of peak. For each matched peak, we estimate the corresponding convergence by using the
universal NFW density proﬁle (Eq. 18). In the calculation of expected convergence from haloes, we convert the mass deﬁned
by M = 4π/3 × 200¯ρmR3
200 to the virial mass by using the halo concentration shown in Eq. (19). In total, for the ΛCDM
cosmology, we ﬁnd 25,806 and 12,865 pairs of peaks and haloes over 100 noise-less maps and noisy maps.

The left panels of Figure 8 shows the scatter plot of peak height in convergence map and the expected convergence by
NFW haloes in the case of the ΛCDM cosmology. The vertical axis corresponds to peak height, while the horizontal axis
shows the corresponding convergence expected by NFW haloes. Thus, the colour map in each panel shows the probability of
Prob(Kpeak,obs|Kpeak,h). We present the line of y = x as the dashed line in each panel. In lower panel, we show the eﬀect of
the modulation of peak height as the magenta line with error bars. The magenta line represents hKpeak,obs|Kpeak,hi, which is
deﬁned by

hKpeak,obs|Kpeak,hi(z, M ) =Z dKK Prob(K|Kpeak,h(z, M ))

(53)

and the error bars reﬂect the scatter of hKpeak,obs|Kpeak,hi. As shown in previous works, we conﬁrm the good correspondence
between the matched dark matter haloes and lensing peaks in the noise-less maps. Nevertheless, even in the noise-less maps,

Figure 8. The correspondence between dark matter haloes and lensing peaks. In each panel, the vertical axis represents the peak height
and the horizontal axis shows the expected convergence of NFW haloes. In both right and left panels, the top panel shows the scatter
plot of peak height and the expected convergence by the matched haloes in absence of noise, while the lower panel corresponds to the
case with shape noise. Left: The ΛCDM model. Right: f (R) model with |fR0| = 10−5.

the better correspondence between the matched haloes and peaks would be generalized by (Shirasaki et al. 2015)

Kpeak,obs(z, M ) = c0 + c1Kpeak,h(z, M ).

(54)

In the top left panel of Figure 8, the gray line shows Eq. (54) with c0 = −0.01 and c1 = 1.1 and the gray point represents
hKpeak,obs|Kpeak,hi measured from the simulation results. Also, our model as shown in Eq. (53) can explain the average relation
between peaks and dark matter haloes even in the case with noise.

We also perform the similar calculations in the F5 model. We simply assume the NFW proﬁle with the halo concentration
expressed by Eq. (19) in the case of non-zero |fR0|. In the F5 model, we ﬁnd 29,767 and 14,410 pairs of peaks and haloes
over 100 noise-less maps and noisy maps, respectively. The right panels in Figure 8 correspond to the case of the F5 model.
Compared to the left panels, we cannot ﬁnd any signiﬁcant impact on f (R) gravity on the correspondence between haloes
and peaks in both noise-less maps and noisy maps. In the right top panel, we again show measured hKpeak,obs|Kpeak,hi from
the pairs of haloes and peaks by the gray points, while the gray line represents Eq. (54) with c0 = −0.01 and c1 = 1.1. Thus,
the probability of Prob(Kpeak,obs|Kpeak,h) is less aﬀected by the modiﬁcation of gravity for the HS model with |fR0| <∼ 10−5.
This result is consistent with the result shown in Figure 3 because the expected peak height for a given NFW halo Kpeak,h
would be determined mainly by the tangential shear proﬁle at θ ∼ 2 − 3θG, where the eﬀect of f (R) gravity should be less
than 10%.

5.2.2 Abundance of high signiﬁcance local maxima

We then consider the abundance of local maxima with high height, which is expected to be associated with single massive
dark matter halo along a line of sight. As shown in Figure 8, the probability distribution function of observed peak height for
a given matched dark matter halo is less aﬀected by the modiﬁcation of gravity. This implies that the number count of high
signiﬁcance local maxima can be useful to extract information about the number density of dark matter haloes, or the halo
mass function.

Assumed that the halo density proﬁle would not be aﬀected by the modiﬁcation of gravity, we can predict the abundance
of high signiﬁcance local maxima as shown in Section 3.2.2. Figure 9 shows the comparison between measured abundance from
100 ray-tracing simulations and our model. In both left and right panels, the red points with error bars represent the number
count of local maxima in the noisy maps, while the blue is for the noise-less maps. The error bars correspond to the standard
deviation over 100 realizations. Also, the dashed and solid lines are our model for the noisy and noise-less cases, respectively.
As shown in this ﬁgure, our model can provide the good ﬁt to simulation results in the standard ΛCDM models, regardless
of the presence or absence of shape noise. For the f (R) model, we compute the mass function with the corrected mass variance,

(55)

where σf (R) is the mass variance with the linear matter power spectrum in the f (R) model and σΛCDM is the mass variance in

the ΛCDM model. The transition mass scale Mth and the parameter p are found to be Mth = 1.345×1013 h−1M⊙(cid:0)|fR0|/10−6(cid:1)3/2
and p = 2.448 in Li & Hu (2011). We take Eq. (55) and simply adopt the functional form of mass function calibrated
in Tinker et al. (2008). Note that we have conﬁrmed that this is a reasonable approximation in our halo catalogs with
M200 ≥ 1013 h−1M⊙ and the redshift of 0-1. Under these assumption, we can compare the abundance of high signiﬁcance
peaks with our model prediction and then ﬁnd that the our model works even in the F5 model for both noisy and noise-less
maps.

5.2.3 General peak count and its cosmological application

As summarized in Section 3.2.2, peaks can be deﬁned by local maxima or minima in the smoothed convergence map in
general. In this section, we examine the eﬀect on f (R) gravity on number count of local maxima and minima by using 100
ray-tracing simulations. We estimate the statistical uncertainty of peak counts in a 25 deg2 area from the standard deviation
over 100 realizations. For the statistical uncertainty in the ongoing HSC survey with the sky coverage of 1400 deg2, we scale

the uncertainty with the sky coverage (i.e., by a factor of p1400/25).
The left panel in Figure 10 shows the number count of peaks with the smoothing scale θG = 1 arcmin and θo = 10 arcmin,
while the right corresponds to the ratio of the number of peaks between the f (R) model and the ΛCDM model. The peak
height ν are binned into 40 bins from −10 to 10 linearly. For the HS model with |fR0| = 10−5, we ﬁnd that the number of
peaks with the ν >∼ 3 would increase with a level of ∼ 30% compared to the ΛCDM model. Interestingly, the number of peaks
with ν <∼ − 2 would be also aﬀected by the presence of the ﬁfth force, increasing the number of peaks by a factor of ∼ 1.5.

Since negative peaks are caused by superposition of underdense regions on line of sight, increasing the number of voids in
f (R) gravity might aﬀect the number count of negative peaks. On the other hand, we cannot ﬁnd any signiﬁcant deviations
in peak counts for |fR0| = 10−6.

Let us quantify the signiﬁcance of the diﬀerences shown in Figure 10 by introducing the following statistic

where N |fR0|
peak,i represents the number count of i-th bin for the model with the parameter of |fR0|, σpeak,i is the statistical
uncertainty of the number count of i-th bin for ΛCDM. Note that N ΛCDM
peak,i corresponds to the case of ΛCDM. Table 2 shows
the result of signal-to-noise ratio. In the estimation, we do not use high peaks whose number count is zero. The signiﬁcance
for the F5 model becomes more than 1σ as average value in each bin.

6 CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION

We have studied the matter density distribution in f (R) gravity. In particular, we have focused on the large-scale structures
which can be observed in weak lensing measurement. We have performed ray-tracing simulations in two diﬀerent f (R) gravity
models and the standard ΛCDM model. Using a set of weak lensing maps and dark matter halo catalogs, we have investigated
the connection with observables and large-scale structures in a realistic way. Throughout this paper, we have considered two
diﬀerent statistical methods and compared the statistics in the standard ΛCDM model with the f (R) model proposed in
Hu & Sawicki (2007). Our main ﬁndings are summarized as follows:

(i) The averaged tangential shear proﬁle around dark matter haloes shows a clear dependence on f (R) gravity. The signif-
icant deviation from ΛCDM is found at both the inner region and the outskirt of dark matter haloes. The trend of deviation
would depend on the halo masses and redshifts in a non-monotonic way.

(ii) While the averaged tangential shear proﬁle around voids is expected to be a promising target to probe the modiﬁcation
of gravity, we cannot ﬁnd any signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the f (R) model and ΛCDM model even if using ∼ 1000 voids.
This result indicates that the uncertainty of the center of voids and the projected matter distribution along a line of sight
would mitigate the eﬀect of f (R) gravity on the signal around voids. However, larger surveys would be able to distinguish
proﬁles between ΛCDM and f (R) gravity.

(iii) Troughs, the underdense regions in the surface density ﬁeld of galaxies, are proposed as the tracer of the underdensity
in the Universe. In this paper, we consider the troughs deﬁned by dark matter haloes and examine how the tangential shear
proﬁle around troughs would be aﬀected by the modiﬁcation of gravity. The stacked tangential shear proﬁle around troughs
clearly shows the contribution from the underdensity in the Universe. The clear deviation from ΛCDM have been conﬁrmed
when the angular separation would be equal to the search radius of troughs. However, we also ﬁnd that correct understanding
of halo catalogs would be required in order to sample the underdense regions in the Universe with troughs.

(iv) Peaks in a reconstructed mass map from weak lensing measurement can in principle contain the cosmological informa-
tion about dark matter haloes, voids and structures along a line of sight. We perform matching analysis of local maximum
in a map to dark matter halo along the line of sight. We then conﬁrm that the clear correspondence between local maxima
and haloes in absence of shape noises and the modulation eﬀect in the relation of maxima and haloes for noisy maps. There-

fore, proper understanding of the relation of maxima and haloes enables us to extract the information about the halo mass
function. We demonstrate the number count of local maxima can be explained by the combination of the halo mass function
and the correspondence between maxima and haloes. Furthermore, the number count of local minima would bring additional
information about the modiﬁcation of gravity.

(v) Throughout this paper, we consider the two models of f (R) gravity with the degree of freedom of a new scalar ﬁeld
|fR0| = 10−5 and 10−6. We ﬁnd that the stacked analysis around troughs and peak number counts can constrain on the model
with |fR0| = 10−5 with ∼ 2σ level, assumed ongoing imaging surveys with the sky coverage of a several thousands squared
degrees. On the other hand, it is challenging to constrain the model with |fR0| = 10−6 with our proposed statistical methods.
Although our ﬁndings would play an essential role to understand the nature of gravity with weak lensing measurement,

there are several caveats and limitations that must be kept in mind when interpreting the results presented in this work.

First, the simulation in this paper does not include any baryonic physics and the possible eﬀect due to the presence of
massive neutrinos. Both baryonic physics model and massive neutrinos can aﬀect the cosmic structure formation in various
length scales. (e.g., Duﬀy et al. 2010; Cui et al. 2012; Massara et al. 2014; Castorina et al. 2015). In particular, our results on
stacked signals around haloes (Section 5.1.1) would potentially be aﬀected by the baryonic physics at the inner regions, while
the massive neutrinos might have some impacts on the signals at the outskirts of each dark matter halo. The simplest way to
quantify these eﬀects is to get together all eﬀects simultaneously: to run cosmological hydrodynamical simulation under the
modiﬁed gravity (e.g., Puchwein et al. 2013) in the presence of massive neutrinos.

There exist other statistical methods of weak lensing to extract cosmological information about the modiﬁcation of grav-
ity. For instance, the two-point correlation of cosmic shear (or power spectrum) has been proposed in previous works (e.g,
Heavens et al. 2007) and applied to existing data set (e.g., Harnois-D´eraps et al. 2015). Moreover, higher-order correlation
function (e.g, Gil-Mar´ın et al. 2011) and morphological statistics (Ling et al. 2015) would be useful to improve the constraints
on the nature of gravity in weak lensing surveys. Since our simulations can be helpful to understand the cosmological infor-
mation content of weak lensing statistics, we plan to study them in details in future (Shirasaki et al. in prep).

On the stacked analysis with voids, we should note that only ∼ 10 voids are found in each realization of our simulation.
In addition, we might underestimate the errors due to the limitation of simulation size. Thus, larger weak lensing simulation
would be more important to characterize the statistical property of cosmic voids and improve our understanding of the stacked
signals around voids under the modiﬁed gravity. For this purpose, the full-sky simulation of weak gravitational lensing (e.g.,
Shirasaki et al. 2015) would be suitable to increase the sample size of voids and haloes. A larger sample of voids and haloes
would also enable us to study the mass assembly history in the modiﬁed gravity theory.
