We model the superﬂuid ﬂow of liquid helium over a real surface, derived from a wire used to
experimentally generate turbulence (proﬁled by atomic force microscopy). We employ large-scale,
microscopically-resolved numerical simulations of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation to ﬁnd that vortices
nucleate predominantly from the sharpest features in the surface, and drive the formation of a
complex boundary layer of vortex loops and rings. As boundary layers conventionally arise from
viscous forces, this result is surprising and opens up new insight into the nature of superﬂows at
real boundaries.

At suﬃciently low temperatures,

liquid helium has
two striking properties. Firstly, it ﬂows without viscos-
ity. Secondly, its vorticity is constrained to thin mini-
tornadoes, characterised by their ﬁxed circulation h/m
(the ratio of Planck’s constant to the mass of the rel-
evant boson - one atom in 4He and one Cooper pair in
3He-B) and microscopic core radius ξ (0.1 nm in 4He and
10 nm in 3He-B). In contrast, the eddies in everyday vis-
cous ﬂuids can have arbitrary shape, size and circulation.

Of ongoing experimental and theoretical study is the
nature of turbulence in superﬂuids [1–4], a state dom-
inated by an irregular tangle of quantised vortex lines.
Despite the fundamental diﬀerences between superﬂuids
and classical ﬂuids, the observations of Kolmogorov en-
ergy spectra, famed from classical isotropic turbulence, in
superﬂuid turbulence [1] are suggestive of a deep connec-
tion between them. Superﬂuid turbulence is nowadays
most commonly formed by moving obstacles, including
grids [5], wires [6–9], forks [10, 11], propellers [12, 13],
spheres [14] and other objects [15]. Despite progress
in visualizing the ﬂow of superﬂuid helium in the bulk
[16, 17], including individual vortex reconnections [18],
there is little direct experimental evidence about what
happens at boundaries. Here, vortices are believed to be
generated by two mechanisms. Firstly, they can nucle-
ate at the boundary of the vessel or object. When the
relative ﬂow speed is suﬃciently low, the ﬂow is laminar
(potential) and dissipationless. Near curved boundaries,
however, vortex nucleation occurs if the local ﬂow veloc-
ity exceeds a critical value. Secondly, the vortices can be
procreated from so-called ‘remanent vortices’ which are
present in the system since cooling the helium through
the superﬂuid transition. Note that remanent vortices
can be avoided using judicious, slow experimental proto-
cols [24].

The nano-scale vortex core in superﬂuid helium is com-
parable in size to the typical roughness of the bound-
aries of the vessel or stirring object. Unfortunately the
lack of direct experimental information about vortex nu-
cleation at the boundaries and the subsequent vortex-

boundary interactions, limit the interpretation of exper-
iments. Theoretical progress is challenging and to date
has focussed on smooth and idealised surfaces. In prin-
ciple, the superﬂuid boundary conditions are straight-
forward: the superﬂuid velocity component which is per-
pendicular to the boundary must vanish at the boundary,
whereas the tangential component (in the absence of vis-
cous stresses) can slip. For the latter reason, we do not
expect boundary layers, typical of viscous ﬂows. Imple-
menting these superﬂuid boundary conditions, Schwarz
[19] and Tsubota et al. [20] found that one or more vor-
tices sliding along a smooth surface can become deﬂected
or trapped by a small hemispherical bump. Such bumps
can also serve as nucleation sites for vortices; the local
superﬂuid velocity is raised at the pole of the bump and
more readily breaks the critical velocity for vortex nucle-
ation [21]. Moreover, recent simulations [22] show that,
if the bump is elliptically shaped and elongated perpen-
dicular to the imposed ﬂow, the superﬂuid velocity at
the pole is enhanced, reducing the critical velocity for
vortex nucleation and increasing the vortex nucleation
rate (for a given super-critical imposed ﬂow). We ex-
pect therefore that microscopically-small surface rough-
ness may promote the nucleation of vortices at a surface.
For pre-existing vortex lines in the vicinity of the surface,
there is also indirect experimental evidence of a ‘vortex
mill’ mechanism which continuously feeds vorticity into
the ﬂow by stretching the existing vortex lines. This
mechanism only works if the spooling vortex, held by
pinning sites at the surface, is aligned in the streamwise
direction [23].

To shed light on the microscopic behaviour of super-
ﬂow near a rough boundary, we work with the three-
dimensional proﬁle of a real surface, shown in Fig. 1(a).
This corresponds to a one square micron region of the
surface of a thin NbTi wire used to generate quantum
turbulence at Lancaster University, as proﬁled via atomic
force microscopy (AFM) [25]. The surface is rough, with
a height up to around 10 nm, and features sharp grooves
and steep ridges, likely to have arisen during the etch-

2

ing phase of the wire preparation. We assume that such
a ‘mountain’ landscape is typical of the wires and sim-
ilar objects used across other superﬂuid turbulence ex-
periments. We model the ﬂow of superﬂuid helium over
this surface through the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii
equation [26] (GPE) for a weakly-interacting Bose super-
ﬂuid. The superﬂuid is parameterised by a complex wave-

function Ψ(r, t) =(cid:112)n(r, t) exp[iS(r, t)], where n and S

represent density and phase distributions, and its dynam-
ics obey

where m denotes the particle mass, the coeﬃcient g
accounts for local particle interactions, and V (r, t) de-
scribes a potential landscape acting on the ﬂuid. The
GPE is equivalent to a hydrodynamic model with
ﬂuid density n(r, t) = |ψ(r, t)|2 and velocity v(r, t) =
(¯h/m)∇S, and embodies a classical continuity equation
and a modiﬁed Euler equation (the modiﬁcation being
the presence of a quantum pressure term, arising from
zero-point motion of the particles and responsible for
vortex nucleation). While the GPE provides only a qual-
itative model of the strongly-interacting superﬂuid he-
lium (for example, the excitation spectrum of the GPE
lacks helium’s roton minimum), it nevertheless contains
the key microscopic physical ingredients of our problem:
ﬁnite-size vortex core, vortex interactions and vortex re-
connections [26]. Furthermore, any boundary, however
irregular, can be conveniently modelled through the po-
tential V (r, t). Within the GPE model and assuming a
√
homogeneous particle density n0, the vortex core size is
characterised by the healing length ξ = ¯h/
mn0g. The
natural speed, energy and time scales are provided by

the speed of sound c =(cid:112)n0g/m, the chemical potential

µ = n0g and the unit τ = ξ/c, respectively.

The more traditional Vortex Filament Model

[27],
which has been used to model the motion of vortex lines
in the presence of smooth spherical [28, 29], hemispheri-
cal [19, 20] and cylindrical boundaries [30, 31], is less ap-
propriate than the GPE for a number of reasons. Firstly,
it assumes that the vortex core is inﬁnitesimal compared
to any other length scale (which is not the case if vor-
tex core and wall roughness are comparable); secondly,
it does not contain vortex nucleation and kinetic energy
losses due to sound emission; thirdly it is diﬃcult to gen-
eralise from smooth, geometrically simple (cylindrical or
spherical) boundaries to the rough boundaries which in-
terest us.

Our results are based on intensive simulations of the
GPE over the entire AFM surface, resolved down to a
sub-core scale of ∆ = 0.4ξ. In 4He the vortex core size is
a0 ≈ 10−10 m [32], such that the above AFM image has
true core dimensions (104 × 104 × 100)a3
0. It is not com-
putationally feasible to model the corresponding range of
scales directly within the GPE; as such we map the AFM

low) and vortices (red) in the vicinity of the two tallest moun-
tains (view taken along y over the x-range 15ξ ≤ x ≤ 125ξ)
at the same times. Just prior to vortex nucleation [plots (b,
c), t = 20τ ], the largest ﬂuid speed arises in the vicinity of
the highest mountains. When the ﬂuid speed becomes su-
percritical at the highest mountains [plots (d, e), t = 30τ ],
vortex lines becomes nucleated. At later times [plots (f, g),
t = 100τ ], vortices continue to be shed predominantly by the
highest mountains, where the ﬂuid speed continues to be high-
est. The nucleation vortex loops pass downstream (to the left
of the mountains), ﬁlling a turbulent layer up to the height
of the highest mountain. This causes a marked downstream
spreading of high ﬂuid speed.

3

In the vicinity of the surface the local ﬂuid speed,
v = |v|, is enhanced considerably by the surface’s rough-
ness, with the maximum values occurring near the tallest
mountain [Fig. 1 (b)]. Up to a critical imposed speed,
the ﬂow remains laminar and free of vortices. For in-
creased imposed ﬂow velocity, the critical velocity is ﬁrst
exceeded at the highest mountain, leading to nucleation
of a vortex line [Fig. 1 (e)], and then by other high
mountains on the surface. The critical velocity for vor-
tex nucleation across this surface occurs for an imposed
ﬂow uc ≈ 0.2c; this is considerably smaller than, say a
hemispherical bump for which uc ≈ 0.5c [21], indicating
the signiﬁcant role of the surface roughness in enhancing
the breakdown of laminar ﬂow.

Nucleated vortices either peel oﬀ the boundary, or,
more frequently, slide down the slopes of the mountains
(carried by the imposed ﬂow) in the form of partially at-
tached vortex loops. Such loops then interact with other
vortices, becoming more distorted, and forming a tan-
gle of vortices downstream of the mountains [Fig. 1(g)].
This tangle of vortices is continuously fed by further vor-
tices nucleated from the mountains. The spreading of the
velocity plots in Figs. 1 (b, c) reveals the formation of
clusters of vortices on the leeward side of the mountains,
which eventually saturate a turbulent layer. Vortex lines
occasionally undergo vortex reconnections, or twist, de-
tach and ﬂy oﬀ as small vortex rings. At later times and
higher imposed ﬂow velocities, the critical velocity is ex-
ceeded across greater areas of the surface. However, even
after considerable vortex nucleation, the highest moun-
tains continue to dominate the vortex nucleation - here
the ﬂuid velocity is always the highest [Fig. 1(f)] and
vortex shedding occurs at the fastest rate. This conﬁrms
that, with our choice of parameters, the vortex tangle
which develops can be interpreted as generated either in-
trinsically or extrinsically: in both cases vortices nucleate
at the highest mountains before ﬁlling the layer below.
Indeed, Fig. 1(g) shows the formation of a long curved
vortex which becomes twisted generating more vorticity
by spooling smaller vortex loops, as in the vortex-mill
mechanism envisaged by Schwarz [23].

As the number of vortices increases, a complex, turbu-
lent region consisting of superﬂuid vortex loops and rings
is formed [Fig. 2 (a,b)]. This is strongly localised to the
vicinity of the surface, up to approximately the height of
the highest mountain. Reconnections due to twisting of
vortex lines or interaction of neighbouring lines form a
continuous ejection of vortex rings which spread into the
bulk, visible in the upper part of Fig. 2(a, b). The vor-
tex length in the vicinity of the boundary, which has so
far been increasing, approximately saturates in value. A
supplementary movie [33] shows the full evolution of the
turbulent layer. For slower, but still super-critical, im-
posed ﬂows the turbulent layer still forms with the same
height, albeit with reduced density of vortices.

The turbulent layer is not isotropic: on the average,

image onto the largest practical healing length volume of
(400 × 400 × 100)ξ3. This is simulated in a box of size
(400× 400× 200)ξ3 (the numerical domain being twice as
high as the highest mountain in the third dimension), on
a 1000×1000×500 spatial grid, which is periodic in x and
y. Time evolution is performed with 4th order Runge-
Kutta scheme with time step ∆t = 0.01τ , and performed
across 256 (2.6 GHz) cores of a high-performance com-
puter cluster. The rough surface is incorporated into the
GPE by setting a potential barrier V = 5µ below the sur-
face, heavily prohibiting density there; above the surface
the density recovers to the bulk value n0 (where V = 0)
over a lengthscale of the order of ξ.

We ﬁrst obtain the stationary solution of the GPE in
the presence of the rough boundary, with bulk density
n0. The GPE is then transformed into a frame moving at
speed u in the x-direction (corresponding to the imposed
ﬂow) by the addition of a Galilean boost term i¯hu∂Ψ/∂x
to the right-hand side of the GPE. The ﬂow speed is
ramped up smoothly from zero to the ﬁnal value of u =
0.6c; this ﬁnal value is such that the critical velocity for
nucleation is comfortably exceeded.

(a)(b)vortex lines are ﬂattened parallel to plane of the surface
(the areas covered by vortex cores on the lines of sight
along the x and y directions are only 62 and 60% respec-
tively of the same area along the z direction).

In conclusion, our results suggest that the walls of
channels which conﬁne the ﬂow of superﬂuid liquid he-
lium and the surfaces of moving objects (wires, grids,
propellers, spheres) which are used to generate super-
ﬂuid turbulence in current experiments may be covered
by a thin ‘superﬂuid boundary layer’ consisting of vor-
tex loops and rings. This is a surprising eﬀect, because in
ﬂuid dynamics boundary layers usually arise from viscous
forces, which in superﬂuid liquid helium near the temper-
ature of absolute zero are completely absent. These ﬁnd-
ings further illustrate the deep analogies between classi-
cal and quantum ﬂuids. The experimental implications of
‘superﬂuid boundary layers‘ on macroscopic observables
need to be investigated. Our results should particularly
stimulate experiments in 3He-B, where, due to relative
large healing length, it is possible to study ﬂows with
controlled surface height roughness.
