ABSTRACT
We have initiated a program to study the baryon content and dynamic state of galaxy clusters.
Here we present results primarily from XMM-Newton observations of two optically-selected
galaxy clusters, A1095 (z (cid:39) 0.210) and A1926 (z (cid:39) 0.136). We ﬁnd that both of them are
actually cluster pairs at similar redshifts. We characterize the temperatures of these individual
clusters through X-ray spectral ﬁts and then estimate their gravitational masses. We show a
rich set of substructures, including large position offsets between the diffuse X-ray centroids
and the brightest galaxies of the clusters, which suggests that they are dynamically young.
For both A1095 and A1926, we ﬁnd that the mass required for the cluster pairs to be bound
is smaller than the total gravitational mass. Thus both cluster pairs appear to be ongoing ma-
jor mergers. Incorporating SDSS and NVSS/FIRST data, we further examine the large-scale
structure environment and radio emission of the clusters to probe their origins, which also
leads to the discovery of two additional X-ray-emitting clusters (z (cid:39) 0.097 and z (cid:39) 0.147) in
the ﬁeld of A1926. We estimate the hot gas and stellar masses of each cluster, which compared
with the expected cosmological baryonic mass fraction, leave ample room for warm gas.
Key words: galaxies: clusters: general – galaxies: clusters: individual: A1095/A1926 –
galaxies: clusters: intracluster medium– X-rays: galaxies: clusters.

INTRODUCTION

One of the most enduring problems in our understanding of cosmo-
logical structure formation is the missing baryon problem — after
summing up the known mass in the form of stars, interstellar ma-
terial, hot (X-ray emitting) intragalactic medium in clusters, and
observed intergalactic gas, a large portion of the expected baryonic
mass is still missing (Fukugita, Hogan, & Peebles 1998; Bregman
2007). Theoretically, these missing baryons are believed to reside
primarily in the so-called warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM)
at moderate overdensity (Cen & Ostriker 1999, 2006), heated to
temperatures of 105 − 107 K by adiabatic compression and shocks
during formation of clusters/galaxies via a hierarchical sequence of
mergers and accretion of smaller systems (e.g., Vazza et al. 2009).
Observationally, the baryon fraction of the total gravitational mass
in the inner region of a typical cluster (r (cid:54) r500, within which the

mean mass density is 500 times the critical density of the Uni-
verse), for example, has been shown to be substantially smaller than
the universal value as expected from the standard cosmology (An-
dreon 2010; Gonzalez et al. 2013); this missing baryon problem is
most convincing observed in relatively low- and intermediate-mass
clusters (M500 (cid:46) 1014M(cid:12); Lagan´a et al. 2013). Similar conclusions
have also been drawn for the baryon fraction in individual galaxies
(McGaugh et al. 2010; Werk et al. 2014).

On one hand, X-ray emission is routinely observed in the hot
intracluster medium (ICM), mostly from inner regions (r (cid:46) r500),
and recently from outer regions of rich clusters (r ∼ r500 − r200) as
well (Bonamente et al. 2012; Eckert et al. 2012; Walker et al. 2013;
Wang & Walker 2014). These observations characterize the gravi-
tational mass and dynamic state, as well as the hot ICM properties
of an individual cluster, by measuring its X-ray temperature, mor-
phology and structure. The non-homogeneous or multi-temperature
(or even multiphase) nature of the ICM is inferred, especially for
the outer regions, and is indeed expected from simulations and the-
oretical models of the structure formation (Roncarelli et al. 2006,

2

Chong Ge et al.

Molnar et al. 2009). These simulations and models show a compli-
cated shock heating/cooling history of the ICM in the outer regions
and beyond (up to ∼ 2r200 , where the strong external shock of the
accretion ﬂow is located, while the virial radius is typically located
at r ∼ r200; Molnar et al. 2009). In addition, the cluster environ-
ment can strongly affect the gaseous halos of individual galaxies,
via processes such as ram-pressure stripping and pressure compres-
sion (e.g., Lu & Wang 2011).

On the other hand, observations of UV absorption lines from
warm gas along the sight-lines toward background QSOs have
shown a signiﬁcant reservoir of baryonic matter in the outskirts of
galaxies on scales of their virial radii. For example, Ly-α and/or
O VI absorbers are often found to be around individual galaxies of
luminosities L > 0.5L(cid:63) to r ∼ 150 kpc with a high covering factor
of ≈ 90% for blue, star-forming galaxies and a substantially lower
covering factor for red, passive galaxies (Prochaska et al. 2011;
Tumlinson et al. 2011a, 2013). Occasionally, such absorbers are
also observed to much greater distances (r (cid:38) 1 Mpc) away from
ﬁeld galaxies. The exact nature of such absorbers (e.g, collisional
ionization vs. photoionization for O VI-bearing gas) remains uncer-
tain (e.g., Oppenheimer & Schaye 2013). So far only a handful of
sight-lines have been probed for the ICM or intragroup medium via
far-UV (FUV) absorption lines. Nevertheless, sight-lines to several
nearby groups of galaxies clearly show absorption lines in the in-
tragroup medium, with deﬁnite signals of a multiphase plasma as
lines arising from species of very different ionization states (such
as C III and O VI are present for same absorbers; Shull, Tumlinson
& Giroux 2003; Pisano et al. 2004; Tripp et al. 2011; Tumlinson et
al. 2011b; Muzahid et al. 2015).

The fortuitous alignment of UV-bright background QSOs be-
hind X-ray emitting foreground clusters provides a unique oppor-
tunity to probe the mass content and physical conditions of the
multiphase ICM. With suitable cluster/QSO pairs, the hot clus-
ter gas can be sensitively studied with X-ray emission diagnos-
tics while the “warm-hot” ICM can be probed with ultraviolet ab-
sorption lines imprinted on the spectrum of the background QSO.
Such pairs provide a laboratory to examine the physical processes
of the ICM, freshly accreted from the intergalactic medium and/or
stripped out of individual galaxies, as well as the gaseous halos
of individual cluster galaxies. Clearly, the understanding of these
phenomena and physical processes is important not only for study-
ing the environmental impact on galaxy evolution and for deter-
mining the baryon content and physical/dynamic state of the clus-
ters, but for their utility as cosmology probes as well (e.g., via the
observed Sunyaev-Zel’dovich effect signal; Carlstrom, Holder &
Reese 2002).

We have started a program to use cluster/QSO pairs to exam-
ine the multiphase intracluster medium in and around cluster galax-
ies using XMM-Newton/Chandra and the Hubble Space Telescope
(HST). An important factor in the selection of the background
QSOs is that the FUV and near-UV (NUV) ﬂuxes have been ac-
curately measured. Although most QSOs by nature are UV bright
in the rest frame, the probability of intersecting a Lyman limit sys-
tem (logNHI > 17.2), which effectively blocks all radiation below
(1 + zc)×912 ˚A, increases with redshift. Hence, not all QSOs with
zQ > zc are suitable for this work. We cross-reference the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; York et al. 2000) DR7 quasar catalog
with the GALEX all-sky survey data to select targets that have reli-
able FUV and NUV ﬂux measurements. Similarly, not all clusters
are suited for absorption studies with HST/Cosmic Origins Spec-
trograph (COS). The O VI doublet (1032 and 1038 ˚A), in particular,
is not redshifted into an observable region below zc < 0.10. Below

these redshifts, the sensitivity of COS declines, and the absorption
from H2 in the Milky Way can impede detection and measurement
of weak O VI lines. Thus we cross-correlate our list of UV bright
QSOs with the SDSS GMBCG catalog (Hao et al. 2010), consist-
ing of over 55,000 clusters, to search for proper zc > 0.10 targets.
For an optimal use of the XMM-Newton and HST observing time,
we select only those relatively rich clusters with the temperatures
(cid:38) 2 keV and 0.10 < zc < 0.25 paired with background QSOs of
mFUV < 18.3 and projected distances (cid:46) 1.5× r200. The projected
distances all lie well within the external accretion shock radii ex-
pected for the clusters (e.g., Molnar et al. 2009). In addition, we
check to see if the O VI lines would lie near lines from the Milky
Way interstellar medium (ISM) to ensure that there is no blend-
ing with ISM lines. In total, we have identiﬁed 10 potential targets.
Two of these targets, A1095 and A1926, have been observed with
XMM-Newton and HST for our program.

Here, we present a study of these two clusters based primar-
ily on our XMM-Newton observations. The rest of the present pa-
per is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the XMM-Newton
observations and our data reduction and analysis procedures; Sec-
tion 3 presents the results based on the X-ray observations; Sec-
tion 4 compares multi-wavelength observations to further the ex-
ploration of the clusters, including their dynamic state, substruc-
ture, large-scale environment, and baryon content, as well as im-
plication of our ﬁndings; Section 5 summarizes our results and
conclusions. We use the standard cold dark matter cosmology with
H0 = 70 km s−1 Mpc−1, Ωm=0.3 and ΩΛ=0.7.

2 X-RAY OBSERVATIONS AND DATA ANALYSIS

Table 1 provides a log of the XMM-Newton observations employed
in this paper. This study uses data collected from the European
Photon Imaging Cameras (EPIC), which were set in the full-frame
mode, using the Thin1 ﬁlter. We processed the data using the Ex-
tended Source Analysis Software (ESAS; Snowden et al. 2008;
Kuntz & Snowden 2008), as part of the XMM-Newton Science
Analysis System (SAS, version 13.5.0.), with the associated Cur-
rent Calibration Files (CCF)1.

2.1 Imaging analysis

We use the XMM-ESAS routines, emchain and epchain, to create
the raw event ﬁles of the Metal Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) and
pn CCDs. When XMM-Newton orbits the Earth, solar protons with
energies less than a few hundred eV are funneled towards the detec-
tors. These soft protons create a time-variable (unpredictable ﬂar-
ing) instrumental background component inside the open ﬁelds of
view (FOV) of the detectors. The affected time intervals are ﬁltered
out with the routines mos-ﬁlter and pn-ﬁlter, which ﬁt a Gaussian
to the peak of the distribution of counts collected from the FOV in
the 2.5-12 keV and ﬁlter time intervals with the count rates devi-
ating more than 1.5 σ from the peak. The useful exposure times
after this ﬁltering are listed in Table 1. We use the routine cheese to
perform source detection on the ﬁltered data, using a ﬂux threshold
of 3.0× 10−15 erg cm−2 s−1, which is estimated from the relation
(Watson et al. 2001) of detection limit with exposure time. We ap-
ply the routines mos-spectra and pn-spectra to create spectra and

images. The instrumental or quiescent particle background is mod-
eled with routines mos back and pn back, which use data from the
corners (unexposed pixels) of the detectors, and ﬁlter-wheel closed
data sets with hardness ratios and count rates similar to those mea-
sured during our observations. Data from the CCDs that were in
anomalous state or damaged are excluded from subsequent analy-
sis. The MOS1, MOS2 and pn images are combined with the rou-
tine comb. We use the routine adapt to create the background sub-
tracted, exposure corrected EPIC images, which are binned by a
factor of 2 and adaptively smoothed with a minimum number of
50 counts per bin. Our ﬁnal combined images of the clusters are
shown in Figs. 1 and 2.

2.2 X-ray source detection

We search for the X-ray sources in the S (0.5-2 keV), H (2-7 keV)
and B (0.5-7 keV) broad bands. The task cheese uses two algo-
rithms to detect sources: eboxdetect and emldetect. The former runs
twice, while the latter once for each observation. In the ﬁrst pass,
eboxdetect uses a ‘local’ mode, estimating the background from a
region local to each source detection box. Detected source candi-
dates from this ‘local’ box method are masked out from the image
and a smooth global background map is produced by ﬁtting a spline
surface to the remaining data. The second eboxdetect pass then ap-
plies this map to detect sources with greater sensitivity. This new
source list forms the input to emldetect for the ﬁnal Maximum-
Likelihood PSF ﬁtting, which then exports the results of source de-
tection.

We excise all detected sources within regions where the sur-
face brightness of the point source is expected to be > 25% of
the surrounding background to construct diffuse X-ray maps of the
clusters.

2.3 Spectral analysis

We extract the on-cluster spectra from the regions outlined by the
bold cyan circles shown in Figs. 1b and 2b. The spectra are analysed
using the X-ray spectral ﬁtting package XSPEC (version 12.8.0).
We model an on-cluster XMM-Newton spectrum as a linear combi-
nation of various components:
The source: the cluster emission is modeled with an absorbed ther-
mal component (wabs*apec). The temperature and normalization
are free parameters with metallicity ﬁxed at 0.3 Z(cid:12) (Anders &
Grevesse 1989), and the redshift (see Table 2 for details) is set to
the value of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) in each cluster.
The quiescent particle background: the continuum can be sub-
tracted as background spectra in XSPEC, while the instrumental
lines due to the interaction of the particle background with the de-
tectors, which may vary from observation to observation, cannot be

c(cid:13) 2016 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

completely removed by subtracting a spectrum constructed from
the ﬁlter wheel closed data. These lines are ﬁt as gaussians with
line energies and widths allowed to vary.
The cosmic X-ray background: this contribution can be mod-
eled with three components: an unabsorbed thermal one (apec)
for emission from the Local Hot Bubble or heliosphere; an ab-
sorbed thermal one (wabs*apec) for emission from the Galac-
tic halo and/or intergalactic medium; and an absorbed power-law
(wabs*powerlaw) for emission from an unresolved background of
cosmological sources. The ROSAT all-sky survey (RASS) spec-
trum from the HEASARC X-ray Background Tool2 is added to
constrain the contribution of the cosmic background. The RASS
spectrum is extracted from a 1◦ − 2◦ annulus surrounding the clus-
ter with an appropriate response ﬁle also provided by the tool.
The soft protons: residual soft proton contamination may remain
in some XMM-Newton observations even after light curve screening
and is modeled as an additional unfolded powerlaw component, not
affected by detector response.
The solar wind charge exchange: this process (Snowden, Col-
lier & Kuntz 2004) can also create additional emission lines in the
observed spectra. Therefore, an additional gaussian component is
included to model this possible emission.

The parameters of the above models are set and linked as
suggested by Snowden et al. (2008) and the XMM-ESAS Users
Guide3.

We also conduct both morphological and spectral analyses of
many of the prominent X-ray sources/features to determine their
nature. Their spectra are extracted from regions shown in Figs. 1a
and 2a with the background contributions estimated locally.

3 RESULTS

We present the results from the source detection in Tables 3 and 4.
A total of 47 and 78 sources are detected in the A1095 and A1926
ﬁelds, respectively. While most of these sources are likely back-
ground AGNs, some may represent peaks of the ICM emission. We
will discuss such cases in the context of ICM substructures (see
§ 4.2). Here we focus on the global diffuse X-ray properties of the
clusters.

3.1 Global X-ray morphological properties

Figs. 1 and 2 show the X-ray images of the A1095 and A1926
ﬁelds. Each contains two apparent clusters with comparable size
and brightness. In fact, they have been separately identiﬁed in

some optical catalogues of clusters (Table 2; see § 4.4 for fur-
ther discussion). For ease of reference here, we label GMBCG
J161.87087+15.23391 (Hao et al. 2010) as A1095W and its com-
panion, GMBCG J162.00202+15.26823, as A1095E in Fig. 1b,
and we label SDSS J143021.94+243429.1 as A1926S and GM-
BCG J217.61927+24.67202 as A1926N in Fig. 2b. A1095W and
A1095E are relatively well separated. The X-ray morphology of
A1095W itself is quite round globally (though elongated in the in-
ner region), whereas A1095E appears irregular, showing roughly a
triangle shape. A1926S and A1926N are not clearly separated in
projection. They together appear to have a “peanut” shaped mor-
phology; both are elongated in the direction of the line connecting
their centers and contain substantial substructures.

We present the radial 0.5-2 keV intensity proﬁles of each clus-
ter as a function of the projected off-center radius (R) in the top
panels of Fig. 3. Constructed by accumulating counts in annuli of
width 15(cid:48)(cid:48) around each cluster X-ray centroid, the proﬁles are ﬁt-
ted in SHERPA with the standard β -model (Cavaliere & Fusco-
Femiano 1976) of the form:

I = I0(1 + x2)1/2−3β ,

(1)

where x = R/rc, while I0, rc and β are the free parameters. Their
best-ﬁtting values are included in Table 2.
We also extract the intensity proﬁles along the major axes of
the cluster pairs, by accumulating counts in slices of 25(cid:48)(cid:48) × 50(cid:48)(cid:48) and
20(cid:48)(cid:48)×50(cid:48)(cid:48) for A1095 and A1926 pairs, respectively (outlined as the
long rectangles in Figs. 1b and 2b). The proﬁles (Figs. 4a,b) show
various shoulders (even local peaks), as well as asymmetries (rel-
ative to the cluster centers), indicating the presence of substantial
substructures in the ICM density distributions of the clusters.

3.2 X-ray spectral properties

We model the X-ray spectra of the clusters as optically-thin thermal
plasmas in collisional ionization equilibrium (apec; § 2.3), multi-
plied by a wabs foreground absorption with the Galactic hydrogen
column density ﬁxed at NH = 2.76× 1020 and 2.59× 1020 cm−2
(Dickey & Lockman 1990) for A1095 and A1926, respectively.
The results for individual clusters are listed in Table 2. The bottom
panels of Fig. 3 presents the radial temperature proﬁles, which are
extracted from a set of 45(cid:48)(cid:48)-wide annuli around the X-ray centroid
of each cluster (except for 35(cid:48)(cid:48) in the A1926N case).

In order to examine evidence for possible shocks, we also
obtain the temperature proﬁles (Figs. 4c,d) along the major axes
(Figs. 1b and 2b) of the cluster pairs. In general, the counting statis-
tics from individual spectral extraction regions are only moderate,
and the angular resolution is not sufﬁcient, which results in un-
certain data that cannot reveal sharp temperature jumps. But one
can readily see a steep temperature drop (indicated by the arrow in
Fig. 4c), associated with an intensity substructure on the western
side of A1095W (marked as Source 3 in Fig. 1a).

Table 5 presents the spectral ﬁt results of luminous compact X-
ray sources/features (marked in Figs. 1a and 2a) in the ﬁeld of each
cluster. These sources are also detected by the XMM-ESAS source
detection routine, marked with the same numbers (in Figs. 1a and
2a) as Column (2) of Tables 3 and 4. These spectra are typically
well ﬁtted with an absorbed power-law model, except for Sources 2,
3, 8, 11 and 13 in the A1095 ﬁeld and Source 5 in the A1926 ﬁeld,
which are better ﬁtted with a thermal plasma model. This modeling
is mainly intended to characterize the overall spectral shapes of the
sources, but may also provide hints about their nature.

4 DISCUSSION

In this section we discuss the relationship between cluster pairs
(Section 4.1), their dynamical states and substructure properties
(Section 4.2), their large scale environment (Section 4.3), the com-
plementarity of the optical and X-ray detections of clusters (Sec-
tion 4.4), and their baryon content (Section 4.5). This discussion is
largely based on a comparison of our X-ray analysis results with
existing multi-wavelength data, mostly in optical and radio bands.

4.1 Relationship between cluster pairs

Given the projected proximity of the clusters in each pair, the ques-
tion is whether or not they are physically associated. We address
this question by comparing the galaxy redshift distributions of the
clusters. Fig. 5 shows the SDSS photometric redshift distribution of
galaxies along the projected radial distance from the X-ray centroid
of each cluster and the corresponding redshift histograms. Galax-
ies with SDSS spectroscopic redshifts are shown in Figs. 6-7. The
BCGs are marked with yellow circles, whose redshifts are adopted
as those of the clusters, except for A1926S, whose BCG (z=0.134)
is spatially far off the X-ray centroid. Instead, the average spectro-
scopic redshift (0.136) of the 7 galaxies near the centroid (Fig. 7) is
adopted for A1926S. The blue and red lines in Fig. 5 represent the
peak photometric redshifts of galaxies and the spectroscopic red-
shifts of the BCGs in the clusters. Accounting for uncertainties in
these redshift estimates and their biases, the two clusters in each
pair appear to have consistent redshifts.

With the redshift of each cluster, we can now use the
above X-ray temperature measurements to estimate the grav-
itational mass (M200) and virial
radius (r200). We use the
scaling relations of Arnaud, Pointecouteau & Pratt
(2005):
h(z)M200 = 5.3 × 1014M(cid:12)(kT /5keV)1.72, and h(z)r200 = 1.7 ×
103kpc(kT/5keV)0.57, where h2(z) = Ωm(1 + z)3 + ΩΛ. We also
estimate the gravitational mass M500 within r500, to which our X-
ray data are sensitive, and list the results in Table 2. The clusters
in each pair have comparable mass and size because they have a
similar temperature. Although we do not have clear spectral evi-
dence for inter-cluster shocks, the morphological irregularity and
orientation of the paired clusters, as shown in § 3.1, do strongly
indicate that they are interacting with each other. We explore this
issue further in the following subsection.

4.2 Dynamic states and substructures of the clusters

We use the two-body model (e.g., Beers, Geller & Huchra 1982;
Mohr & Wegner 1997) to estimate the total mass needed for a clus-
ter pair to be bound. The system is bound if it has a negative total
energy:

and the plane of the sky. Eq. 2 can be re-arranged as

Zitrin et al. 2012; Cui et al. 2016). Because the maximum value of
sin2α cosα is ∼ 0.38, we infer from Eq. 4 that Mtot (cid:38) 2.9×1014M(cid:12)
and 0.54× 1014M(cid:12) for the A1095 and A1926 pairs, respectively,
which are smaller than their total gravitational masses (M200),
5.0× 1014M(cid:12) and 2.4× 1014M(cid:12). In particular, the required value
of Mtot for A1926 may be substantially over-estimated here, be-
cause the BCG in A1926S shows a large offset in both the position
and velocity from its X-ray centroid (specz=0.136). Therefore, the
two cluster pairs could be bound and represent ongoing or future
major mergers (with mass ratio < 3:1).

The dynamic state of a cluster is intimately related to its sub-
structure, which can be traced by various ICM and galaxy prop-
erties. First, we examine the temperature structures of our sample
clusters. In general, clusters can be categorized into cool core clus-
ters (CCCs) and non-cool core clusters (NCCCs; e.g., Jones & For-
man 1984; Sanderson, O’Sullivan & Ponman 2009). A CCC tends
to show a relaxed and symmetric morphology, whereas an NCCC
often exhibits disturbed overall shape and substructure. Cluster
merging has been suspected to be the primary mechanism for trans-
forming CCCs to NCCCs. Thus NCCCs are typically in dynam-

c(cid:13) 2016 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

ically young states (e.g., Sanderson, Ponman & O’Sullivan 2006;
Chen et al. 2007; Leccardi, Rossetti & Molendi 2010). The bot-
tom panels of Fig. 3 show that A1095W, A1095E and A1926N are
most likely NCCCs, while the state of A1926S is uncertain because
of the large measurement errors in the temperature distribution.

Second, we check the X-ray morphologies of the individual
clusters, in comparison with the distributions of the galaxies. A
close-up view of the clusters is shown in Fig. 8. Particularly in-
teresting are the morphologies of the X-ray peaks associated with
BCGs, as well as their locations in the clusters. As the most lumi-
nous galaxy (which is almost always an elliptical), the BCG tends
to be found positionally at the gravitational center (Cui et al. 2016)
and kinematically near the rest frame of a cluster (Schneider, Gunn
& Hoessel 1983; Hoessel & Schneider 1985). Thus, the BCG of a
relaxed cluster should generally lie at cluster X-ray centroids (Jones
& Forman 1984; Rhee & Latour 1991; Lin & Mohr 2004). How-
ever, most of the BCGs in our pair clusters are off their global X-ray
centroids, even in projection and are thus consistent with being in
merging systems (e.g, Sanderson, Edge & Smith 2009; Hudson et
al. 2010; von der Linden et al. 2014; Rozo & Rykoff 2014).

Third, we incorporate information from radio observations to
further probe the states of the clusters. Radio emission, predom-
inately representing synchrotron radiation from relativistic elec-
trons/positrons, can arise from diffuse halos, radio lobe relics

and/or mini-halos (Feretti et al. 2012), as well as individual galaxies
(e.g., jets from AGNs). Both the morphology and intensity of the
emission can be used to trace the dynamic state of a cluster: e.g.,
subcluster mergers tend to increase the ram-pressures and lead to
particle acceleration and ampliﬁcation of magnetic ﬁeld in the ICM
(Buote 2001; Feretti 2002). Both A1095 and A1926 ﬁelds are cov-
ered by the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS; Condon et al. 1998)
and the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-Centimeters
(FIRST; Becker, White & Helfand 1995). The NVSS is the largest
VLA radio survey at 1.4 GHz, with a limiting ﬂux density of ∼
2.5 mJy (5σrms) and an angular resolution of 45(cid:48)(cid:48) (FWHM). The
NVSS radio intensity contours are included in Figs. 6-7, which give
a global view of the cluster pairs. The FIRST is also at 1.4 GHz and
has a limiting ﬂux density of ∼ 1 mJy (5σrms) and an angular reso-
lution of 5.(cid:48)(cid:48)4 (FWHM). The intensity contours from this survey, as

well as those from the NVSS, are shown in Fig. 9, which presents
a close-up view of the individual clusters. All the clusters, except
for A1926S, show signiﬁcant radio emission. Accounting for the
resolution difference between the two surveys, the NVSS intensity
contours seem to trace well the distribution of the FIRST sources,
which mostly represent radio jets and lobes associated with indi-
vidual galaxies. A probable exception is the extended radio feature
G in A1095E (Fig. 9), which has no apparent galaxy counterpart.
Some of the lower surface brightness extensions demonstrated by
the NVSS contours may be diffuse in origin. The examples are the
large-scale extensions to the southwest and northwest of A1095E,
as well as to the northeast of A1926N. These extensions may repre-
sent the emission from materials stripped from individual galaxies
by the ram-pressure of the ICM. Such stripping may start in regions
far away from cluster cores, as indicated by the lopsided morphol-

While the above discussion is focused on the common or compara-
tive properties of the clusters, we describe their individual distinct
signatures and corresponding implications for the dynamic states
in the appendix.

The above discussion strongly suggests that the four clusters

c(cid:13) 2016 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

tures, which are probably best explained by recent cluster assem-
bling, ongoing subcluster mergers, and/or strong interplays.

Note. Errors are at the 90% conﬁdence level. The redshifts of three GMBCG clusters are determined from the values of BCGs, while the redshift of
A1926S is estimated from average redshifts of 7 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts near the X-ray centroid. The offset is the projected distance between
the X-ray centroid and the BCG. The count rate/normalization (CR/η) as well as the temperature are from the best-ﬁtting apec model of each cluster. The
cluster mass (M500/M200) and radius (r500/r200) are estimated from the temperature (Arnaud et al. 2005). The β -model parameters of Eq. (1) are from
the best ﬁt to the 0.5-2 keV intensity proﬁle. The inferred parameters include the central proton density (n0), the hot gas mass (Mgas) and stellar mass
(Mstar) within r500, and the ratio of Mgas or Mstar to M500 ( fgas or fstar), the stellar mass in the parentheses is estimated with the relation of Gonzalez et
al. (2013). The proton column density (Np) is at the projected distance of the corresponding UV-bright background QSO (SDSS J104741.75+151332.2 for
the A1095W/A1095E pair; SDSS J143125.88+244220.6 for the A1926S/A1926N pair).

toward low redshift, because of the increasing incompleteness of the galaxy sample with increasing redshift. The dashed blue lines mark the ±σ redshift

(except for A1926S, for which the average spectroscopic redshift of the 7 galaxies near the cluster center is adopted).

Santos et al. 2013). A1095 and A1926 ﬁelds may thus represent
snapshots of this hierarchical formation process of massive bound
structures. We have shown the presence of multiple clusters, as well
as their substructures, which most likely represent ongoing subclus-
ter mergers.

A1926. We mark the positions and redshifts of galaxies from SDSS
and clusters identiﬁed in NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database
(NED4). The projected separation is ∼ 1.8 Mpc between A1095W
and A1095E. The nearest other cluster is WHL J104756.9+153431
(photo z=0.197), projected ∼ 3.8 Mpc north of A1095E. They may
be connected by a ﬁlament of galaxies (cosmic web) and thus be-
long to the same large-scale structure. A1926S and A1926N, with
a projected separation of ∼0.67 Mpc, probably have a companion
cluster, GMBCG J217.49013+24.69973, which (though too faint
to be ﬁrmly detected in X-ray) is located ∼1.1 Mpc west of the
A1926S/A1926N pair center and at a comparable photo z=0.135.
Therefore, the A1095 and A1926 pairs just represent the most out-
standing peaks of the underlying evolving larger scale structures of
galaxies.

4.4 Comparing optically selected and X-ray selected galaxy

clusters

Various methods have been used to discover clusters of galax-
ies. Although massive clusters can now readily be detected via
their SZ effects and sometimes their gravitational lensing effects,
intermediate-mass ones, as dealt with here, are still mostly iden-
tiﬁed in optical and/or X-ray. X-ray detection is sensitive to the
emission measure of the ICM, tracing the deep potential wells of
individual clusters, and is thus relatively free from projection con-
tamination (e.g., Rosati, Borgani & Norman 2002). Optical surveys
(e.g., Gal et al. 2003; Koester et al. 2007; Hao et al. 2010; Wen,
Han & Liu 2012) have been used to detect candidate clusters on all
mass scales. The detection is based on identifying concentrations
of galaxies, spatially and often kinematically. Because the detec-
tion signal depends on the concentration linearly, projection effects
can be serious.

Let us use our cases to brieﬂy examine the limitations of both
optical and X-ray surveys, as well as how they may be used in a
complementary fashion. Fig. 11 illustrates the positions and rich-
nesses of various versions of optically detected clusters. We see
good correspondences between optically rich clusters with apparent
diffuse X-ray structures, which leads to the discovery of another X-
ray-bright cluster MaxBCG J217.84740+24.68382 (z=0.097; bold
cyan circle in Fig. 11b). These correspondences represent the ﬁrm
identiﬁcations of these clusters. But the multiplicity, as well as the
position and richness of the optical detections, vary from one ver-
sion to another, presumably due to the differences in the adopted
methodologies (e.g., with or without spectroscopic redshifts, red-

shift range, apertures, etc.). This problem becomes especially seri-
ous for such a ﬁeld of closely paired clusters, because of severe con-
fusion. On the other hand, optical detections seem to be sensitive
to potentially poor clusters (e.g., green circles in Fig. 11b), which
show little sign of any diffuse X-ray emission. Conversely, one X-
ray cluster candidate (marked by the white ellipse in Fig. 11b), not
found in any optically selected cluster catalog, seems to be reason-
ably X-ray-bright and has an ICM temperature of 1.9+1.0−0.9 (corre-
sponding to M200 (cid:39) 0.9+0.9−0.7 × 1014M(cid:12); R200 (cid:39) 0.9+0.3−0.2 Mpc) and
a possible BCG SDSS J142941.65+243417.1 (z=0.147). Although
a quantitative comparison with the consideration of the richness
uncertainties in both optical and X-ray is beyond the scope of the
present work, this brief discussion demonstrates the importance of
the imaging X-ray data with sufﬁcient spatial resolution and sensi-
tivity in the conﬁrmation and characterization of galaxy clusters.

4.5 Baryon content

We ﬁrst estimate the distribution and total mass of the hot ICM.
This estimate utilizes the results from the radial X-ray intensity ﬁt
with the β -model (Eq. 1) and from the spectral ﬁt for each cluster
(Table 2). Assuming a spherical symmetry of the distribution, the
deprojected hydrogen density proﬁle of the β -model as a function
of the physical off-center radius (r) of a cluster is (e.g., Sarazin

points: all galaxies with SDSS measured photometric redshifts in the 0.210± 0.02 interval (i.e. about ±6000km s−1 around the mean cluster velocity) for
A1095 and 0.136± 0.02 interval for A1926; red points: galaxies with measured spectroscopic redshifts in the ±0.01 (about ±3000km s−1) interval; solid
magenta circles: the same as the larger white circles in Fig. 1b for A1095 and Fig. 2b for A1926; dashed blue circles: locations of additional clusters identiﬁed
from NED with redshifts in the 0.02 redshift interval around A1095 and A1926. The diameter of each blue circle is 2 Mpc (i.e., the typical size of a cluster).

Figure 11. Cluster ﬁndings in the A1095 (a) and A1926 (b) ﬁelds. The three-color montages are composed of the images from SDSS r-band (red), g-band
(green) and 0.5-7 keV X-ray emission (blue), while the overlaid circles represent the position and richness of optical detected galaxy clusters from various
catalogues: the Gaussian Mixture Brightest Cluster Galaxy catalog (GMBCG; Hao et al. 2010; solid green circle), the Northern Sky optical Cluster catalog
(NSC; Gal et al. 2003; dashed red circle), Wen+Han+Liu catalog (WHL; Wen et al. 2012; bold yellow circle), and the Maximum likelihood redshift Brightest
Cluster Galaxy catalog (MaxBCG; Koester et al. 2007; dashed bold cyan circle). In a theoretical model where the total optical light or number/richness of
galaxies traces cluster mass, the X-ray luminosity is proportional to the richness (N) square (e.g., Section 6 of Popesso et al. 2004), while the distance is
proportional to the redshift (z) in the local universe. Therefore, the radius (in unit of arcmin) of a cluster, represented by a circle here, is R = log(N2/z2),
roughly scaled with its expected X-ray ﬂux.

We can now estimate the hot ICM mass (Mgas) within r500 of
each cluster, using Eq. (5). The estimate is listed in Table 2, which
also includes the hot ICM mass fraction (relative to the gravita-
tional mass).

For future comparison, we here estimate the column density of
the hot ICM at the projected distances of the QSOs for individual
clusters. Using the β -model, we can express the column density of
hot protons through a cluster as

(11)

This expression is for β > 1/3, which is satisﬁed by the measured
values (Table 2). We include the Np values estimated for the indi-
vidual clusters in Table 2.

We now turn to estimate the stellar masses of cluster galaxies
observed by the SDSS. We ﬁt the photometric redshift distribution
of galaxies within r500 of each cluster with a Gaussian function. To
minimize the confusion with background and foreground galaxies.
Those with redshifts deviating more than ±1σ from the Gaussian
peak (mean) are excluded (Fig. 5); this exclusion may lead to slight
underestimate of the mass (which, however, should not change our
later conclusion in any signiﬁcant way). For each of the remaining
galaxies, we convert the SDSS r-band magnitude (after both extinc-
tion correction and k-correction) to the stellar mass by adopting the
color-dependent (g-r color) mass-to-light ratio (Bell et al. 2003)
and the photometric redshift. The results are plotted as ﬁlled star in
Fig. 12.

The above method is straightforward yet biased toward the
low redshift because of increasing incompleteness of the galaxy
sample with increasing redshift, moreover misses the fainter galax-
ies below the detection limit of the SDSS and the intracluster stars
(ICS), while contaminates by galaxies outside r500 sphere in the
r500 cylinder along the line-of-sight direction due to projection ef-
fect and galaxies in the overlap region in such close pairs. Thus
we also estimate the stellar mass fraction based on the scaling re-
lation of M(cid:63),3D = 3.2× 10−2(M500/1014 M(cid:12))0.52 from Gonzalez
et al. (2013) to double check the results. They perform a statistical
background subtraction, include a completeness correction for the
fainter galaxies, take account of the contribution from the ICS, and
apply the deprojection correction. The results are plotted as open
stars in Fig. 12 and listed in Table 2, the ratio between these stellar
mass fractions and the previous ones is ∼ 0.9− 1.3. However, the
difference between these two estimates has minimal impact on the
total baryon fractions.

Fig. 12 shows that the hot ICM and total observed bary-
onic mass fractions increase with the cluster mass, while the stel-
lar mass fraction and stellar-to-gas mass ratio (star-formation efﬁ-
ciency) decreases with the cluster mass, these results are consistent
with previous ﬁndings (e.g., Mohr, Mathiesen & Evrard 1999; Lin,
Mohr & Stanford 2003; Andreon 2010; Dai et al. 2010; Gonza-
lez et al. 2013; Chiu et al. 2016). The observed baryon fraction
of the most massive cluster in our sample is ∼11%, compared
with the cosmological fraction determined from the Wilkinson Mi-
crowave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) 9-year data (∼17%; Bennett

Figure 12. Baryon fraction within r500 as a function of M500: the red dots
are the hot ICM fractions from the X-ray observations; the ﬁlled stars rep-
resent the stellar mass fractions estimated with the SDSS galaxy data, while
the open stars present the stellar mass fractions based on the scaling rela-
tion of Gonzalez et al. (2013), which includes the contribution from ICS
and applies the projection correction; the ﬁlled boxes are the total baryon
fractions of hot ICM plus stellar mass fractions from the SDSS galaxy data,
while the open boxes are the total baryon fractions of the hot ICM plus
stellar mass fractions from Gonzalez et al. (2013); the error is dominated by
the uncertainty in the gravitational mass estimate. The green band marks the
uncertain range of the WMAP 9-year baryon fraction (Bennett et al. 2013).

et al.2013), there is many missing baryons. On one hand, the miss-
ing baryons may be ejected out of central r500 region due to en-
ergetic process such as AGN feedback (e.g. McCarthy et al. 2010,
2011). However, the baryon budget outside of r500 is hard to make
because one need to rely on the extrapolation of the β−model,
which is hardly justiﬁed, to get close to the virial radius of the clus-
ter. On the other hand, the missing baryons may be in the form of
warm ICM, which is undetected by both X-ray and optical obser-
vations. Therefore, the results of upcoming QSO absorption line
observations would help to test this assumption.

5 SUMMARY

We have carefully investigated the diffuse emission from the hot
ICM and X-ray sources in two optically-selected sample cluster
ﬁelds, based on XMM-Newton observations. We have further incor-
porated observations from SDSS and NVSS/FIRST to probe the
relationship among the clusters in each ﬁeld, their dynamic states,
their large-scale environments, the complementarity of the X-ray,
UV, optical and radio observations of the clusters. Our main results
and conclusions are as follows:

• We ﬁnd that each of our sample ﬁelds actually contains a
pair of X-ray luminous clusters at similar redshifts (z = 0.210 and
0.213 for A1095W and A1095E; z = 0.136 for both A1926S and
A1926N). Member clusters in each pair have comparable ICM
mean temperatures (∼ 3.6 keV vs. 3.3 keV for A1095W/A1095E
and ∼ 2.2 keV vs. 2.0 keV for A1926S/A1926N). The minimum
mass required to bind each cluster pair, is smaller than its total grav-
itational mass. The clusters in each pair also morphologically ap-
pear to be mutually perturbed. Therefore, these paired clusters are

most likely bound systems and would eventually merge into two
massive clusters.
• The paired clusters are characterized by asymmetric diffuse
X-ray morphologies with direct evidence for subclustering, by the
large offsets of the BCGs from the global centroids of diffuse X-ray
emission, and/or by signiﬁcant radio emission on various scales.
Therefore, the individual clusters themselves are probably the re-
sults of recent subcluster mergers or still in early formation stages,
and they may represent the most outstanding snapshots of the un-
derlying larger scale structures, consistent with the hierarchical for-
mation paradigm of galaxy clusters.
• We have demonstrated the power of the modern X-ray obser-
vations in detecting clusters and in characterizing their ICM prop-
erties, as well as the complementary values of the optical and radio
surveys in studying the relationship among the apparently paired
clusters and their dynamic states. In addition to the two pairs, we
have also identiﬁed two X-ray-bright poor clusters (z(cid:39)0.097 and
0.147) in the A1926 ﬁeld. Moreover, one needs to be extremely
cautious in using optically selected clusters (especially for paired
ones, because of the large uncertainties in their centroids, masses,
and structures) for cosmological studies.
• We have estimated the hot ICM and stellar masses in each
cluster. The hot ICM fraction increases with the cluster mass, while
the stellar fraction decreases. The total observed baryon fraction,
which is smaller than the expected cosmological baryonic mass
fraction, leaves ample room for a substantial mass presence of
warm ICM.

The results from this study will aid any further investigation of
the clusters, especially the interpretation of the QSO absorption line
observations. We hope to characterize how the heating/cooling may
depend on the dynamic states of the clusters, as well as their mass
and projected distances (e.g. Wang & Walker 2014), advancing our
understanding of the structure formation in the universe.

Sources numbers are the same as those marked in Figs. 1a and 2a and
have counterparts of the detected X-ray sources in Tables 3 or 4 (marked
as the front superscripts of the corresponding entries in Column 2). Er-
rors are quoted at the 90% conﬁdence level.
a: ﬂuxes in the 0.5-7 keV band and in units of 10−14 erg cm−2 s−1.
b: in units of keV; the metal abundances are ﬁxed at 0.3 solar unless
stated otherwise.
c: from a thermal plasma ﬁt, which also gives a ﬁtted metal abundance
of 0.05+0.07−0.03 solar.

APPENDIX A: FEATURES OF INDIVIDUAL CLUSTER
A1095W: This cluster itself seems to be undergoing a subcluster
merger. As shown in § 3.1, the cluster stands out in terms of its ra-
dial X-ray proﬁle. The β value of the cluster (∼1.1) is larger than
those of the other three clusters (∼0.5) or the average value (∼0.65)
of 46 clusters studied by Jones & Forman (1984). This is a strong
indication for the presence of substantial substructure in the ICM
distribution of A1095W. The presence of such substructure leads
to an effective increase of the core radius and a steep drop in the
outer part of the proﬁle, which is reﬂected in a large ﬁtted β value
(Jones & Forman 1999). Indeed, the core radius of A1095W is al-
most three times larger than that of A1095E, although they have
similar temperatures as listed in Table 2.

Strong evidence for the substructure is also present in the
galaxy distribution of A1095W. The distribution shows two con-
centrations of galaxies, morphologically resembling the northwest-
southeast X-ray elongation as shown in Fig. 8a. The northwest con-
centration is associated with the most prominent X-ray substruc-
ture, which is detected as a bright and extended X-ray peak (marked
as Source 3 in Fig. 1a; its surface brightness proﬁle is much ex-
tended than the PSF of XMM-Newton, e.g., Ghizzardi 2002) and
has a radio counterpart (D in Fig. 9a). The concentration most
likely represents a subcluster, which still retains its own ICM with

a temperature lower than its surroundings (Fig. 4c; A1095 Source
3 in Table 5; § 3.2). The other galaxy concentration is around the
BCG (SDSS J104729.00+151402.0), which is ∼ 210 kpc east of
the X-ray centroid of the cluster. The radio emission predominantly
arises from multiple compact structures resolved in the FIRST map
(Fig. 9a). Both A and B components likely represent double lobes.
The separation between the lobes is 7(cid:48)(cid:48)/23 kpc for A or 10(cid:48)(cid:48)/32 kpc
for B; the optical counterparts of A (SDSS J104729.00+151402.0;
z=0.210) and B (SDSS J104727.41+151310.6; z=0.206) appear to
be normal early-type galaxies (ETGs), according to their SDSS
spectra. The counterpart of C (SDSS J104731.29+151402.2; photo
z=0.227) is also an ETG. In fact, none of the bright radio-emitting
ETGs in A1095W show strong optical emission lines (according to
their SDSS spectra). Only the radio galaxy D, the central galaxy
(SDSS J104720.55+151503.6; though not classiﬁed as a BCG) of
the northwest galaxy concentration, shows weak line emission and
is classiﬁed as a low-ionization nuclear emission-line region, ac-
cording to the emission line ratios in the BPT diagram (Kauffmann
et al 2003). Therefore, much of the radio emission from the galaxies
may represent relics of their past AGN activities, probably related
to an early stage of the subcluster merger.
A1095E: In addition to its very asymmetric X-ray morphology
and the apparently large-scale elongated diffuse radio features, as
already described above, this cluster shows a strikingly rich set
of small-scale radio structures (Fig. 9b). Interestingly, the BCG
(SDSS J104800.48+151605.6; z=0.213) itself is not a radio source
and is a normal ETG according to its SDSS spectrum. To the east
of the BCG appears one-sided prominent radio lobe E. To the west
of the BCG is a more-elongated one-sided radio trail F. Its point-
like eastern head seems to coincide with another small group of
galaxies, one of which (SDSS J104759.27+151557.8; z=0.214) is
spectroscopically a normal ETG. The compact radio source H, far
away from the BCG and in the southern part of the cluster, has an
optical counterpart (SDSS J104801.21+151438.4; z=0.216), which
is an ETG with weak emission line. The locations of these radio
sources trace well the triangular X-ray morphology of the cluster.
Therefore, the radio, optical, and X-ray properties of the cluster all
suggest that it is a very unrelaxed system.
A1926S: The chain appearance of bright galaxies in this cluster
resembles its northeast-southwest elongated X-ray morphology as
shown in Fig. 8c. The large offset (∼ 290 kpc in projection) of
the BCG (SDSS J143021.94+243429.1; z=0.134) from the X-ray
centroid of the cluster is particularly striking. But no signiﬁcant ra-
dio emission is found in the NVSS and FIRST map. These facts
may indicate that the cluster is being assembled gently (i.e., not via
a major merger), which is consistent with its ﬂat radial tempera-
ture structure (Fig. 3). The location of the z=0.136 pair of galaxies
(Fig. 9c) to the north coincides with the hard X-ray peak in Fig. 2d,
which may be part of the ICM enhancement.
A1926N: The trailing northeastern low surface brightness radio
emission is oriented in a fashion similar to the extension of the
diffuse X-ray emission of this cluster (Fig. 9d). However, the X-ray
emission is weak and is strongly contaminated by relatively bright
point-like X-ray sources, the spectra of which can be well charac-
terized by power law spectra (Table 5). A high-resolution sensitive
X-ray observation is needed to further the investigation of the clus-
ter. Although classiﬁed as a normal ETG according to its SDSS
spectrum, the BCG (SDSS J143028.62+244019.2; z=0.136) posi-
tionally coincides with a bright X-ray source (marked as Source 3
in Fig. 2a) and with a radio source (Fig. 9d). The BCG appears ∼
90 kpc off from the global centroid of the large-scale X-ray emis-

sion of the cluster. Thus we may still tentatively conclude that the
cluster is a dynamically young system.
