ABSTRACT

The Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi LAT) collaboration has recently re-

ported on 50 months of measurements of the isotropic Extragalactic Gamma Ray

Background (EGRB) spectrum between 100MeV and 820GeV. Ultrahigh Energy

Cosmic Ray (UHECR) protons interact with the Cosmic Microwave Background

(CMB) photons and produce cascade photons of energies 10MeV-1TeV that con-

tribute to the EGRB ﬂux. We examine seven possible evolution models for

UHECRs and ﬁnd that UHECR sources that evolve as the Star Formation Rate

(SFR), medium low luminosity active galactic nuclei type-1 (L = 1043.5erg sec−1

in the [0.5-2]KeV band), and BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs) are the most ac-

ceptable given the constraints imposed by the observed EGRB. Other possibilities

produce too much secondary γ-radiation. In all cases, the decaying dark matter

contribution improves the ﬁt at high energy, but the contribution of still unre-

solved blazars, which would leave the smallest role for decaying dark matter, may

yet provide an alternative improvement.

The possibility that the entire EGRB can be ﬁtted with resolvable but not-

yet-resolved blazars, as recently claimed by Ajello et al. (2015), would leave little

room in the EGRB to accommodate γ-rays from extragalactic UHECR produc-

tion, even for many source evolution rates that would otherwise be acceptable.

We ﬁnd that, under the assumption of UHECRs being mostly protons, there is

not enough room for producing extragalactic UHECRs with AGN, GRB, or even

SFR source evolution. Sources that evolve as BL Lacs on the other hand, would

produce much less secondary γ-radiation and would remain a viable source of

UHECRs, provided that they dominate.

Introduction

The Cosmic Ray (CR) spectrum has been measured to unprecedented accuracy

between the eneries of ∼ 109eV and ∼ 1020eV. Two features in the spectrum where there

is a change in the CR spectral shape, the second Knee at the energy ∼ 0.6EeV (e.g.

Aloisio et al. 2007; Berezhko et al. 2012; Berezinsky 2014) and the Ankle at ∼ 5EeV (e.g.

Waxman 2000; de Marco & Stanev 2005), have been considered as the transition from a

Galactic dominated spectrum to an extragalactic dominated spectrum (see e.g. Allard et al.

2007; Aloisio et al. 2012).

At the transition, a change in the composition is not unexpected (e.g. Stanev et al.

1993). The High Resolution Flys Eye (HiRes) collaboration reported (Abbasi et al. 2010)

that the CR composition is dominated by protons above 1.6EeV. This result can indicate

on a transition below the Ankle. The Telescope Array collaboration (TA) measurements

(Jui & the Telescope Array Collaboration 2012) are consistent with those of HiRes for a

predominately protonic composition. These results are consistent with an earlier report

by HiRes (Abbasi et al. 2008) that claims to observe the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK)

cutoﬀ. The GZK cutoﬀ predicted by Greisen (1966) and Zatsepin & Kuz’min (1966)

independently, is an upper limit of E ∼ 50EeV to the CR spectrum due to interactions of

Ultra High Energy Cosmic Ray (UHECR) protons (E & 1EeV) on the Cosmic Microwave

Background (CMB) photons via pion photoproduction process. If UHECRs are dominated

by heavier nuclei, the steepening of the spectrum is not as sharp as the GZK and it occurs

at lower energies (Aloisio et al. 2013a,b). For this reason, the GZK cutoﬀ, assuming that it

is pinpointed with adequate energy resolution, is considered to be a signature of a proton

dominated composition of UHECRs.

The Pierre Auger collaborations results (Abraham et al. 2010; Boncioli 2014) are

inconsistent with those of HiRes and TA, and show a gradual increase in the average mass

– 5 –

of UHECRs with energy. This raises the possibility that the highest energy UHECRs are

not protons, but it is consistent with their being partly (∼ 1/2) protons, whereas mixed

composition models predict that at the highest energies there are no signiﬁcant number

of light nuclei. Moreover, there are diﬃculties with ﬁtting the UHECR spectrum with an

admixture of heavy elements (Aloisio et al. 2014). In this paper we therefore consider the

UHECR to be protons, or to be half protons by composition, bearing in mind that it is only

a hypothesis. The issue we consider is whether the secondary γ-rays that they produce are

consistent with the extragalactic diﬀuse gamma ray background. If not, this can be taken

as further evidence a) that they are mostly heavy nuclei (which typically requires them to

have a harder spectrum than E −2.0) (Decerprit & Allard 2011; Aloisio et al. 2014), or b)

that they are not extragalactic.

UHECRs are widely thought to be accelerated at astrophysical shocks (for a review see

e.g. Blandford & Eichler 1987). The energy spectrum of the accelerated particles is assumed

to be a power law N(E) ∝ E −α with a spectral index of α & 2. Observations conﬁrm

particles of energies E > 1020eV and even an E = 3 × 1020eV event (Bird et al. 1993)

has been detected. Possible sources that might be able to accelerate CRs up to energies

E & 1020eV, among others are Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) and radio galaxies (see e.g.

Norman et al. 1995; Biermann 1997; Bhattacharjee 2000; Torres & Anchordoqui 2004).

UHECR protons propagating in space are interacting on the CMB photons

and initiating an electromagnetic cascade. The result is observable diﬀuse γ-rays

(Wdowczyk et al. 1972). The two main interactions of protons on the CMB are pair

production p + γCM B → p + e+ + e−, at energies 2.4EeV . Ep . 50EeV, and pion

photoproduction p + γCM B → n + π+, p + γCM B → p + π0 at higher energies. The neutral

pions ultimately decay into high energy photons while the positive pions decay into high

energy photons, positrons, and neutrinos. The electrons and positrons, that emerge from the

– 6 –

decays, interact with the background photons via inverse Compton process e + γb → e′ + γ.

High energy photons are produced with a mean energy of (Blumenthal & Gould 1970)

εγ = 4/3(Ee/mec2)2εb, where Ee is the energy of the incoming electron, me is the rest mass

of the electron, c is the speed of light, and εb is the energy of the background photon.

The high energy photons interact with the Extragalactic Background Light (EBL) via pair

production process γ + γEBL → e+ + e−, producing a pair of electron and positron with

energy of Ee = εγ/2 each. These two processes, inverse Compton and pair production, drive

the development of an electromagnetic cascade. The cascade develops until the energy of

the photons drops bellow the pair creation threshold εth = (mec2)2/εb . At this stage the

photons stop interacting, while electrons continue losing energy and producing photons via

inverse Compton. The cascade results in photons of energy below ∼ 1TeV that contribute

to the isotropic diﬀuse γ-ray emission.

The isotropic diﬀuse γ-ray emission, also known as Extragalactic Gamma Ray

Background (EGRB), was ﬁrst detected by the SAS 2 satellite (Fichtel et al. 1977, 1978)

and interpreted as of extragalactic origin. Later on, Sreekumar et al. (1998) conﬁrmed the

existence of the EGRB by analyzing the EGRET data. In this work, we ﬁt the recently

reported (Ackermann et al. 2015) EGRB spectrum by Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi

LAT) collaboration between 100MeV and 820GeV.

2. UHECR spectrum calculations

In this section we follow Berezinsky et al. (2006) and calculate UHECR spectrum

under the assumptions of a pure proton composition, a homogeneous distribution of sources

between redshift z = 0 to the maximal redshift zmax and continuous energy losses. For the

energy loss rates of UHECR protons in interactions on the CMB we use the calculations

made by Berezinsky et al. (2006) as well.

– 7 –

The diﬀerential equation describing the energy loss rate of a UHECR proton at redshift

z is

−

dE
dt

= EH(z) + b(E, t)

(1)

where E is the proton energy at epoch t, b(E, t) is energy losses of UHECR protons

of energy E at epoch t to pair production and to pion photoproduction, and H(z) =

H0(Ωm(1 + z)3 + ΩΛ)1/2 is the Hubble constant at redshift z with the parameters Ωm = 0.27,

ΩΛ = 0.73 and H0 = 70km sec−1Mpc−1. Changing variable dt/dz = −1/(H(z)(1 + z)) and

integrating we obtain

E(Ez0, z) = Ez0 +Z z

z0

1 + z′ +Z z
dz′ E

z0

dz′

b(E, z′)

H(z′)(1 + z′)

(2)

Equation (2) describes the energy of a CR proton at redshift z where its energy at redshift

z = z0 is Ez0. The ﬁrst integral from the left describes the energy that a CR proton is

losing due to the expansion of the universe. The second integral describes the energy that

a CR proton is losing due to its interactions on the CMB photons. Assuming a power law

distribution for UHECR protons, the production rate of the particles at redshift z per unit

energy per unit comoving volume is

Qp(E, z) = K1F (z)E(E0, z)−α

(3)

where K1 is constant, α is the power law index, F (z) = const × (1 + z)m is the density

evolution of the UHECR sources as a function of the redshift, and m is called the evolution

index.

We assume that the number of protons is conserved. The interactions of protons on

the CMB always involve a proton, except for the positive pion production. In this case,

the outgoing neutron beta decays very fast to proton, electron, and anti neutrino electron.

So eventually the total number of protons is conserved. Then, the number of particles per

– 8 –

comoving volume at redshift z is calculated as

np(Ez0, z0)dEz0 = K1Z zmax

Jp(E0) = K1

H(z)(1 + z)

F (z) E −α dE

(5)

The UHECR spectrum is normalized to the experimental data through K1. The spectrum

in equation (5) is determined by the four parameters: α, m, zmax, and Emax. Emax is the

maximal energy that a CR proton can be accelerated to. So in equation (5) the energy

of a CR particle is limited by E(E0, z) ≤ Emax. For each set of these four parameters, a

diﬀerent UHECR spectrum can be calculated and normalized to the experimental data.

2.1. Energy density of photons resulted from UHECR interactions

The energy density of photons originating from UHECR interactions, can be calculated

by integrating over all energy losses of UHECR protons to the electromagnetic cascade. In

the pion photoproduction process, UHECR protons are losing energy to the electromagnetic

cascade and to the production of neutrinos. The fraction of energy that goes into the

electromagnetic cascade in this process is ∼ 0.6 (Engel et al. 2001). We denote by bem the

relative energy losses of UHECR protons to the electromagnetic cascade.

The amount of energy lost to the electromagnetic cascade, by a proton of energy E,

propagating from redshift z + dz to redshift z, is bem(E, z)dz/(H(z)(1 + z)). Multiplying

this amount of energy by the number of protons of energy E per unit volume at redshift

z, given in equation (4), and integrating over all proton energies, we get the total energy

density of photons produced by UHECR protons at redshift z

ωc(z)dz = dzZ Emax

0

dE

bem(E, z)

H(z)(1 + z)

np(E, z)(1 + z)3

(6)

– 9 –

where np(E, z)(1 + z)3 is the proper density of the protons. Integrating over all redshifts

and deviding by (1 + z)4 (as photons lose energy as 1/(1 + z) and a unit volume expands

by a factor of (1 + z)3) we get

ωc =Z Emax

0

dEZ zmax

bem(E, z)
H(z)(1 + z)2 np(E, z)

(7)

This energy density depends on the UHECR parameters α, m, zmax, and Emax.

3. The spectrum of γ-rays originating from UHECR interactions

The generation rate of γ-ray photons originating from UHECR interactions at redshift

z per unit energy per unit volume is calculated as

Qγ(ε, z) = K2(z)


εχ(cid:17)−3/2
(cid:16) ε
εχ(cid:17)−2
(cid:16) ε

for ε < εχ

for εχ ≤ ε ≤ εa

(8)

The spectral indexes were found by Berezinskii & Smirnov (1975). The normalization factor

K2(z) is constant in energy but depends on the redshift. For convenience we write equation

(8) in the following way

Qγ(ε, z) = K2(z)Qγ(ε, z)

(9)

εa = (mec2)2/εEBL is the threshold energy for pair production by a photon scattering

on the EBL. Suppose a photon of energy εa is interacting on the EBL. This photon

will produce an electron and a positron of energy εa/2 each. This electron (or positron)

will interact via inverse Compton on background photons, producing a photon of energy

εχ = 1/3(εa/mec2)2εb. So, photons of energies εχ ≤ ε ≤ εa do not interact with the

background photons, but electrons continue to produce high energy photons of energies in

this range. At energies below εχ, photons are created by electrons of energies below εa/2.

The γ-ray spectrum at the present time is calculated as

Jγ(ε) =

where Qtot is the total contribution at redshift z from all photons in the EBL spectrum.

the EBL from redshift z to redshift z = 0, observed at the present time with energy ε, given

photons of energy εb at redshift z per unit volume per unit energy. Eth is the threshold

energy for the pair production process given by

Eth =

For the calculations of the γ-ray spectrum at redshift z, we use the best ﬁt model in

Kneiske et al. (2004) as an EBL model.

4. Fitting the Fermi LAT data

In this section we ﬁt the EGRB measured by Fermi LAT. γ-rays from UHECRs and

from Star Forming Galaxies (SFGs) cannot explain the most energetic data points of Fermi

– 11 –

LAT. A high energy γ-ray ﬂux is required. We consider here a possible γ-ray ﬂux from

Dark Matter (DM) decay as the highest energy contribution to the EGRB.

4.1. Components

For calculating the contribution from SFGs, we use the γ-ray spectrum of our Galaxy

from Ackermann et al. (2015). We use the Sum of all modeled components in the right

panel of Figure 4 (Model A) in Ackermann et al. (2015) and subtract the total EGB

(Model A) in Ackermann et al. (2015), Figure 8. We assume that each SFG in the universe

produces this γ-ray spectrum. We assume that the mass density of SFGs in the universe is

half of the mass density of the universe, i.e ∼ 5 × 10−31gr/cm3. Further, we assume that

SFGs evolve in time as the Star Formation Rate (SFR) (equation 16). Lastly, we assume

that the γ-rays from the SFGs are attenuated by the EBL when propagating in space (see

Section 3 for details). Under these assumptions we can calculate the γ-ray spectrum from

SFGs in the universe.

As a high energy contribution to the EGRB, we use γ-rays from DM of mass

mc2 = 3TeV, decaying into bosons (W +W −). The spectrum we use is taken from Figure 7

in Murase & Beacom (2012). The DM lifetime that was used by Murase & Beacom (2012)

in Figure 7 is τ = 1.2 × 1027sec. We adjust this lifetime to optimize the ﬁt. The reason

for using the W +W − channel is the improvement of the ﬁt at high energies. Other decay

channels, such as DM → µ+µ− or DM → b¯b, do not give such a good ﬁt at high energies.

As an example, we also show a ﬁt using the µ+µ− decay channel.

We examine four possibilities for the evolution of UHECR sources: SFR, Gamma Ray

Bursts (GRBs), AGNs type-1, and BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs).

The SFR function is taken from Y¨uksel et al. (2008)

As suggested by Y¨uksel & Kistler (2007), we take the GRB evolution function to be

FGRB (z) ∝ FSF R(z)1.4. So we get

There is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the evolution functions of diﬀerent luminosity AGNs.

Hasinger et al. (2005) calculated the evolution functions of AGNs of four diﬀerent

luminosities in the soft X-ray band (0.5-2KeV): Low Luminosity AGNs (LLAGNs)

LX = 1042.5erg sec−1, Medium Low Luminosity AGNs (MLLAGNs) LX = 1043.5erg sec−1,

Medium High Luminosity AGNs (MHLAGNs) LX = 1044.5erg sec−1, and High Luminosity

AGNs (HLAGNs) LX = 1045.5erg sec−1. LLAGNs are considered as not being able to

accelerate CRs to ultra high energies (see e.g. Waxman 2004). We thus discuss in this work

the possibility that MLLAGNs, MHLAGNs, or HLAGNs are the sources of UHECRs:

For BL Lacs we use two diﬀerent evolution functions. Various studies have found BL Lacs

to evolve very slowly, or not evolve at all (see e.g. Caccianiga et al. 2002; Padovani et al.

2007). Thus, the ﬁrst evolution function we use is corresponding to a no evolution scenario:

FN oEvBL ∝ (1 + z)0

(21)

The second function is related to a subclass of BL Lacs - High Synchrotron Peaked (HSP)

objects. Ajello et al. (2014) used a set of 211 BL Lac objects detected by Fermi LAT

during the ﬁrst year of operation (Abdo et al. 2010). Ajello et al. (2014) have found that

the number density of HSP BL Lacs is strongly increasing with time (i.e. with decreasing

z) and that the number density of the 211 BL Lacs sample is almost entirely driven by this

population at z ≤ 1. For these objects, the evolution function can be described roughly by:

FHSP ∝ (1 + z)−6

Most of the UHECR spectra are calculated with two power law indexes, deﬁned as:

4.1.1. Blazars

(22)

(23)

Blazars have been considered (e.g Ajello et al. 2015; Giommi & Padovani 2015) as

possible sources of γ-rays that explain the EGRB measurements, since most of the resolved

– 14 –

sources are blazars. We show that the joint γ-ray ﬂux from blazars and from UHECRs

evolving as AGNs, GRBs, or SFR is too high and in most cases violates the limits imposed

by the Fermi LAT data even without any additional contribution from SFGs or DM.

UHECRs that evolve as BL Lacs, on the other hand, have enough room to ﬁt the Fermi LAT

data together with blazars. For a blazars contribution, we use the spectrum reported in

Ajello et al. (2015). This spectrum includes the resolved blazar sources. In order to get the

unresolved blazar spectrum, we subtract the Fermi LAT resolved sources (Ackermann et al.

2015) from the blazars spectrum.

4.2. Results

In ﬁgures 1-12, we present our results. Blazars are included only in ﬁgures 5 and 12.

In ﬁgures 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 we show UHECR spectra for diﬀerent parameters,

the corresponding γ-ray ﬂuxes (thin lines), and the total ﬂux from the three sources (thick

lines): SFGs, UHECRs, and DM decay. In these ﬁgures, the dashed-dotted curves diﬀer

from the solid blue line in one parameter, in order to show the sensitivity of the spectra

to the chosen parameters. We show cases where the UHECR spectra are normalized to

the HiRes data as well as cases where the spectra are normalized to the Auger data. The

Auger data have a statistical uncertainty of 22% (Abraham et al. 2010; Boncioli 2014). In

the plots where we present the HiRes data, we also present the Auger data with energy

increased by 16%. The recalibrated Auger data and the HiRes data agree well.

In Figure 1 we show ﬁts to the Fermi LAT data with UHECRs that are adjusted to the

HiRes data. The evolution model is SFR, except for one curve that is corresponding to the

MHLAGNs model. The DM in this plot is assumed to have a lifetime of τ = 4.61 × 1027sec.

In the upper panels of this plot we show the UHECR spectra and in the lower panels we

show the corresponding γ-ray ﬂuxes (the same lines as in the upper panels), with the SFGs

– 15 –

(magenta dashed line) and DM (violet dashed line) contributions, and the sum of the three

components (thick lines). In the left panels we show the sensitivity of the spectra to the

chosen parameters, as the dashed-dotted lines diﬀer from the blue line in one parameter.

The thick dashed blue line in the lower left panel is the same as the thick solid blue line

but without the DM contribution. In addition, in the lower right panel of this ﬁgure we

show how our estimate for the SFGs spectrum is compared to the spectrum in other works.

The thin dotted black line and the thick dotted black line are SFGs spectra calculated

by Tamborra et al. (2014) and by Lacki et al. (2014) respectively. Our line is in a good

agreement with both these spectra.

The maximum γ-ray contribution from UHECRs evolving as SFR is obtained at

redshift z ∼ 7, and in fact the contribution to the γ-ray ﬂux from sources with redshifts

above z = 4 is only a few percent of the total ﬂux. Above z ∼ 7, the contribution is

negligible.

In Figure 2 we show the total contribution from SFGs, UHECRs, and DM for diﬀerent

DM lifetimes. The blue line in this ﬁgure is the same as the blue line in Figure 1. As can be

seen from the ﬁgure, for this set of UHECR parameters, the shortest DM lifetime allowed

in order to respect the bounds set by the Fermi LAT data is τ = 3.75 × 1027sec. DM with

shorter lifetime (such as 2.5 × 1027sec presented in the ﬁgure) will cause a violation of the

limits imposed by the data.

In the upper panel of Figure 3 we show the uncertainties related to Figure 1 for SFR

evolution, with a maximum redshift of zmax = 7 and a maximum acceleration energy of

Emax = 1020eV. The blue band in Figure 3 is the possible range of γ-ray ﬂuxes related

to these parameters. Its lower limit is the thin solid orange curve in the lower right

panel of Figure 1 and its upper limit is the thin solid blue curve in the lower left panel

of Figure 1. The violet band represents DM contribution for lifetime values in the range

– 16 –

3.8-5.5 × 1027sec. Magenta dashed line is the SFGs contribution. The green band is the

total of the three components: UHECRs, DM, and SFGs. In order to show the importance

of the DM contribution to the ﬁt at high energies, we also show the yellow band, which is

the sum of the contributions from UHECRs and SFGs (without DM). As can be seen, the

high energy part of Fermi LAT data cannot be ﬁtted with only UHECRs and SFGs.

In the lower panel of Figure 3 we show a ﬁt to the Fermi LAT data, using DM decay

in the µ+µ− channel, with mass mc2 = 30TeV and a lifetime of τ = 1.1 × 1028sec. The

DM → µ+µ− spectrum was taken from Murase & Beacom (2012) and the lifetime was

adjusted (Murase & Beacom (2012) used τ = 2 × 1027sec). The thin dashed green line in

this ﬁgure is the DM → µ+µ− contribution. The thick dashed green line is the sum of

DM → µ+µ−, SFGs, and UHECRs (with parameters written in the plot). We compare this

ﬁt to the one with the contribution from the W +W − channel (thick violet dashed line). As

can be seen, The W +W − channel gives a much better ﬁt at high energies. Using the µ+µ−

DM, we cannot ﬁt all the high energy data points while keeping the γ-ray ﬂux below the

upper limit of the highest energy data point.

In Figure 4, we normalize the SFR curves to the unrecalibrated Auger data. The DM

lifetime in this ﬁt is τ = 3.87 × 1027sec. The lowest DM lifetime possible in this case is

3.06 × 1027sec. A lower lifetime will give a too high ﬂux. The γ-ray ﬂuxes here are lower

than in Figure 1, since the Auger data have a lower ﬂux than the HiRes data. This is

why we need a higher ﬂux at high energies, from DM decay, in order to ﬁt the Fermi LAT

data. Here, as in Figure 1, the dashed-dotted lines diﬀer from the solid blue line in one

parameter and the thick lines are the sum of the three contributions (UHECRs, SFGs,

abd DM). Note that in the left panels, the line corresponding to a maximum acceleration

energy of Emax = 1021eV (dashed-dotted green) and the line corresponding to the spectral

index of α1,2 = 2.5, 2.2 (dashed-dotted dark red) have almost identical γ-ray spectra. This

Fig. 3.— Upper panel: Uncertainties in the total γ-ray ﬂux from SFGs, UHECRs evolving

as SFR, and DM. The UHECR band (blue) is corresponding to the area between the thin

orange solid line and the thin blue solid line in the lower panels of Figure 1. This band

reﬂects the uncertainties in γ-ray spectra from UHECRs that evolve in time as SFR, have a

maximal acceleration energy of Emax = 1020eV, with maximal redshift of zmax = 7, and are

adjusted to the HiRes and recalibrated Auger data. The DM band (violet) is corresponding

to lifetimes of 3.8-5.5 × 1027sec. The yellow band is the total γ-ray ﬂux from UHECRs and

SFGs (without the DM). The green band is the total of UHECRs, SFGs, and DM. Lower

Panel: Comparison of a ﬁt to the Fermi LAT data using the W +W − decay channel (thick

dashed violet line) to a ﬁt using the µ+µ− channel (thick green dashed line). The DM

contributions are shown in thin magenta and green dashed lines. The contributions from

UHECRs and SFGs are also shown.

is why the total of the α1,2 = 2.5, 2.2 line, SFGs, and DM cannot be seen behind the thick

dashed-dotted green line.

In Figure 5 we show the total contribution of γ-rays from blazars and from UHECRs

evolving as SFR. The unresolved blazar spectrum as extrapolated by Ajello et al. (2015)

from the resolved blazar data is represented in Figure 5 by the thin black dashed line.

We consider the maximum and minimum γ-ray ﬂuxes from UHECRs that are adjusted to

HiRes data and from UHECRs that are adjusted to Auger data. The maximum redshift is

zmax = 7 and the maximum acceleration energy is assumed to be Emax = 1020eV. In all

cases, the total ﬂux of γ-rays from blazars and from UHECRs evolving as SFR is too high.

In the HiRes case, the sum of blazars and the maximum contribution from UHECRs is

already violating the limits imposed by the Fermi LAT data. The total with the minimum

contribution from UHECRs is reaching the edge of the Fermi uncertainties, leaving no room

for high or low energy components. In the case of Auger data, the totals are lower, but

still too high and it is very unlikely that a ﬁt to the entire data will be possible without

exceeding the boundaries. Also in this ﬁgure we show the sum of all unresolved components

(blazars, SFGs, and radio galaxies) in Ajello et al. (2015), Figure 3 (resolved point sources

have been removed), with an additional contribution from 3TeV W +W − decay DM with

lifetime of 4.61 × 1027sec. For 3TeV W +W − DM, this value of lifetime is the minimum

possible to add to Ajello et al. (2015) model, in order to respect the limits set by Fermi

LAT data.

In Figure 6 we do the same as in Figure 1, but for the GRB evolution model. The

lifetime of the DM is τ = 5 × 1027sec. As opposed to the SFR cases, in the GRB model,

the γ-rays are violating the limits imposed by the Fermi LAT data, unless we cut oﬀ the

maximum redshift. This violation can be seen in Figure 6 in sources with maximum redshift

of zmax = 4. The γ-ray spectrum from UHECRs with a spectral index of α1,2 = 2.34, 2.22,

– 21 –

break energy Ebr = 8 × 1018eV, maximum acceleration energy Emax = 1020eV, and

maximum redshift zmax = 4 (thin dashed-dotted orange line) is exceeding the boundaries

set by Fermi LAT even without the contributions from SFGs and DM. The thin solid black

line, corresponding to the parameters α1,2 = 2, 2.35, Ebr = 8 × 1018eV, Emax = 1020eV,

and zmax = 4 is not violating the limits imposed by the data, but the sum of it and the

contributions from SFGs and DM is violating them. The main diﬀerence between these two

lines is in the energy of transition from Galactic to extragalactic CRs. While in the orange

line case, the transition is below the second Knee at ∼ 0.3EeV, the transition in the case of

the black line is at the Ankle at ∼ 5EeV. For two UHECR spectra with the same Emax and

zmax, a lower energy of transition means a higher ﬂux of γ-rays. The γ-ray energy density

corresponding to the orange curve is 37% higher than the energy density corresponding to

the black curve.

In Figure 7, the UHECR spectra are normalized to the unrecalibrated Auger data.

The DM contribution has a lifetime of τ = 4 × 1027sec. The evolution model is GRB. Here,

as in Figure 6, the maximum redshift of the UHECR sources has to be cut oﬀ in order to

respect the boundaries set by Fermi LAT data.

In ﬁgures 8 and 9, the UHECR sources are assumed to be MLLAGNs. In Figure 8, the

spectra are normalized to the HiRes data and in Figure 9 they are normalized to the Auger

data. The MLLAGN sources give almost the same γ-ray spectra as the SFR and there is no

need in a cutoﬀ in the redshift. As in the SFR case, the γ-ray ﬂux from both UHECRs and

blazars is too high to ﬁt the Fermi LAT data. In Figure 8 the DM lifetime is 4.29 × 1027sec.

In Figure 9 the DM lifetimes is 3.75 × 1027sec and it can be as low as 2.86 × 1027sec without

violating the limits imposed by the data.

In Figure 10, the curves are corresponding to the MHLAGNs model, except for one

curve which is corresponding to the GRBs model. The spectra are normalized to the HiRes

– 22 –

data. In the MHLAGNs case, the cut oﬀ in redshift needs to be very low if we do not

want to violate the limits imposed by the data. As can be seen in the ﬁgure, the limits are

violated even for a zmax = 1.5 spectrum. In the case of HLAGNs as UHECR sources, the

γ-ray ﬂux is higher and the required cutoﬀ in the redshift is even lower. It is unlikely then,

that HLAGNs would be the sources of UHECRs, unless they are in the nearby universe.

In Figure 11, the UHECRs are adjusted to the HiRes data and their assumed sources

are non-evolving BL Lacs (left panels) and HSP BL Lacs (right panels). The HSP BL Lacs

evolve as (1 + z)m with a very negative m and thus have both a) a very low secondary γ-ray

contribution and b) a relatively high cutoﬀ energy. It can be seen from the ﬁgure that a

ﬁt to the Fermi LAT data is marginal with γ-rays from UHECRs evolving as HSP, γ-rays

from SFGs, and γ-rays from DM. The total ﬂux at (4 − 9) × 1010eV may be slightly too low

while the total ﬂux at high energies is the highest possible in order to respect the bounds

set by Fermi LAT. The non-evolving BL Lacs give a higher γ-ray ﬂux than the HSPs. Some

sets of UHECR parameters (such as α1,2 = 2.7, 2.5, Ebr = 8 × 1018eV, Emax = 1020eV, and

zmax = 7) provide better ﬁts to the Fermi LAT data than other sets of parameters (such as

α1,2 = 2, 2.4, Ebr = 8 × 1018eV, Emax = 1020eV, and zmax = 7).

In Figure 12 we show the total γ-ray contribution from UHECRs evolving as BL

Lacs (non-evolving BL Lacs in the upper panel and HSP BL Lacs in the lower panel), the

sum of all unresolved components (blazars, SFGs, and radio galaxies), as extrapolated

by Ajello et al. (2015) from the resolved blazar data, and DM. As opposed to the other

evolution models (see Figure 5), there is enough room for γ-rays originating both from

blazars and from UHECRs that evolve as BL Lacs. The UHECR parameters in this ﬁgure

are α1,2 = 2.7, 2.5, Ebr = 8 × 1018eV, Emax = 1020eV, zmax = 7 (upper panel) and α = 2.7,

Emax = 1020eV, zmax = 7 (lower panel). The unresolved part of the sum of all components

in Ajello et al. (2015) is represented by the thick dashed black line, the sum of it and the

– 23 –

γ-rays from UHECRs is represented by the thick dashed blue line, and the sum of it and

the γ-rays from UHECRs and from DM is represented by the thick solid blue line. The DM

lifetimes are 1.3 × 1028sec (non-evolving BL Lacs) and 5.9 × 1027sec (HSP BL Lacs). It can

be seen from the ﬁgure that the DM contribution improves the ﬁt at high energies because

we consider here only astrophysical sources that are too soft. However, blazars come closest

to ﬁtting the Fermi LAT data without DM.

5. Conclusions

GRB, AGN, and star formation were all more common in the past z & 1, with a

comoving density now varying as (1 + z)m with m & 3. Had UHECR sources been active

at z ∼ 1, photons from these backgrounds would pair produce with these UHECRs and the

pairs would ultimately make secondary γ-radiation. γ-rays originating as primaries from

SFGs and as secondaries from UHECRs, with an additional high energy contribution (e.g

from DM decay), can provide a good ﬁt to the EGRB measured by Fermi LAT. We found

that between the evolution models: SFR, GRBs, MLLAGNs, MHLAGNs, HLAGNs, and

BL Lacs, the preferable ones for UHECR sources are SFR, MLLAGNs, and BL Lacs. γ-rays

from UHECRs, whose sources evolve in time as SFR, as MLLAGNs, or as BL Lacs, do

not violate the bounds set by Fermi LAT measurements. A hypothetical class of UHECR

sources that evolve as SFR or as MLLAGNs, is in fact found to be quite robust and most

choices of free parameters (provided that the spectral index of the UHECRs was below

∼ 2.5) gave good ﬁts to both the EGRB and the UHECR spectra. This is consistent

with ﬁndings of other authors (Globus et al. 2015a,b). The secondary γ-rays from these

UHECRs are softer than the diﬀuse high energy γ-ray background observed by the Fermi

LAT, and these evolutionary models all give a better ﬁt if a contribution from decaying DM

particles with masses of ∼ 3 TeV are included.

– 29 –

In the case of BL Lacs whose comoving density does not decline or even increases

with time (i.e. with decreasing z), good ﬁts to the Fermi LAT data could be achieved

with a decaying DM contribution. But, the contribution of secondary γ-rays from these

UHECRs is not a major contribution, so other astrophysical theories for the origin of the

diﬀuse EGRB are not preempted by the hypothesis that UHECRs come from extragalactic

sources with a non-declining comoving density. The DM contribution here appears much

more signiﬁcant than in the other (stronger) evolution scenarios, because the other major

contributor, SFG, are assumed to give a softer spectrum than secondary γ-rays from

UHECRs. However, the possibility that the entire EGRB can be explained by ultimately

resolvable blazars has already been suggested, and, as these blazars become better resolved,

the lower limits on the lifetime of TeV DM particles will rise. The power in BL Lac objects

is about 8 · 1037erg sec−1 Mpc−3 (Ajello et al. 2014), as compared to 1.5 · 1036, 1.7 · 1037,

and 6.9 · 1037 for HLAGNs, MHLAGNs, and MLLAGNs respectively (Hasinger et al. 2005),

so it is not surprising that BL Lac objects would dominate UHECR production at present.

However, other types of AGN were more active in the past, and their past contribution

to the EGRB may have competed with that of BL Lac objects. One might then wonder

whether the EGRB imposes a limit on their being as eﬃcient in producing UHECRs.

Conceivably, there could be a physical reason why UHECR production becomes more

eﬃcient with cosmic time, e.g. because galactic magnetic ﬁelds grow and Emax therefore

increases.

In this work we assumed a pure proton composition. A mixed composition produces a

somewhat lower EGRB, but a good ﬁt to the data requires a very hard injection spectrum

with a spectral index of α ∼ 1-1.6 (Aloisio et al. 2014). Such a hard spectrum, might not

be achieved within the standard acceleration mechanisms that predict a steeper spectrum,

with α ≥ 2. Thus, the UHECR spectrum, to its highest energies, may have a large proton

component.

– 30 –

In ﬁtting the Fermi LAT data, we made use in γ-rays from DM of mass mc2 = 3TeV,

decaying into W +W −. The lifetimes we used in the ﬁts that did not include blazars

were τ = 3.08-5.45 × 1027sec. In the ﬁts where blazars were included (Figure 12), longer

lifetimes were needed: τ = 5.9 × 1027sec and τ = 1.3 × 1028sec. The shortest lifetime

possible (and still provide a good ﬁt) in this work was 2.86 × 1027sec and it was obtained

in the MLLAGNs model for UHECRs normalized to the Auger data. A lower limit of

∼ 6.2 × 1026sec was found recently by Di Mauro et al. (2015) for DM of the same properties.

Di Mauro et al. (2015) assumed that DM decay produces a e+e− ﬂux that contributes to

the AMS-02 experiment data (Aguilar et al. 2014a,b; Accardo et al. 2014). A more strict

lower limit on the DM lifetime was obtained by Giesen et al. (2015) by ﬁtting the AMS-02

data of anti-proton to proton ratio. The lower limit that was obtained (for DM of the same

parametes as we used in this work) by Giesen et al. (2015) is τ ∼ 1.3 × 1027sec. In this work

we obtained somewhat stricter lower limits on the DM lifetimes, especially in the ﬁts that

included blazars (Figure 12). In Figure 13 we show the lower limits on the DM lifetimes for

the W +W − channel obtained by Di Mauro et al. (2015) and Giesen et al. (2015), and the

range of limfetimes possible for the diﬀerent models in this work.

If the blazar contribution is as high as is claimed (e.g Ajello et al. 2015;

Giommi & Padovani 2015), then it would not leave enough room for producing ex-

tragalactic UHECRs with AGN-like, GRB-like or even SFR-like source evolution. The

diﬀuse gamma ray background that is expected for these evolutionary scenarios to

accompany the UHECR production, when added to the blazar contribution, sticks out

above the Fermi LAT measurements of the diﬀuse EGRB. By contrast, UHECRs that

evolve in time as BL Lacs, produce low enough γ-ray ﬂux that have enough room to ﬁt

the Fermi LAT data together with blazars. The addition of a high energy component from

DM decay improves the ﬁt even here, but the DM plays less of a role, so the improvement

should not be taken as a strong evidence for the existence of the decaying DM component.

– 31 –

Another, unforced possibility, is that the UHECRs, even at the highest energy, are

Galactic (Eichler et al. 2016). Here the energy requirements are greatly reduced and

Galactic GRBs could easily provide enough energy (Levinson & Eichler 1993; Eichler & Pohl

2011).
