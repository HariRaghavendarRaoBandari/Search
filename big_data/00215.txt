Considering the intrinsic nonlinearity in a nanomechanical resonator coupled to a charge qubit,
vacuum Rabi splitting eﬀect is studied in a nanomechanical QED (qubit-resonator) system. A
driven nonlinear Jaynes-Cummings model describes the dynamics of this qubit-resonator system.
Using quantum regression theorem and master equation approach, we have calculated the two-time
correlation spectrum analytically.
In the weak driving limit, these analytical results clarify the
inﬂuence of the driving strength and nonlinearity parameter on the correlation spectrum. Also,
numerical calculations conﬁrm these analytical results.

INTRODUCTION

In quantum optics [1] and quantum information, [2]
the well known Jaynes-Cummings model, [3] one of the
most important models, describes the light-matter inter-
action between a two-level quantum system (qubit) and a
boson (resonator). Generally in cavity QED system, [4]
nanomechanical QED system [5] and circuit QED sys-
tem, [6]vacuum Rabi splitting eﬀect has been used to
characterize the coupling strength between a qubit and
a resonator.

Recently, a nanomechanical resonator with frequency
of the order of 1 GHz approaches the quantum regime, [7,
8] it is getting closer to test the basic principles of quan-
tum mechanics. When a superconducting qubit [9, 10] is
coupled to a nanomechanical resonator, [11] we can study
quantum optical properties, such as, quantum decoher-
ence, [12, 13] Rabi oscillation, [14] vacuum Rabi split-
ting, [15] classical-quantum transition [16] and phonon
blockade. [17]

Increasing the amplitude of driving, the nonlinear-
ity response of nanomechanical resonator [18]
is not
negligible which can be used to detect the classical-
quantum transition. [19] When intrinsic nonlinearity of
nanomechanical resonator [20] is considered in the qubit-
resonator system, we can use superconducting qubit to
probe quantum ﬂuctuations of nonlinear resonator. [21]
Recently, the nonlinearity can be exploited to generate
nonclassical states in mechanical systems [22, 23] and se-
lectively address the nanomechanical qubit transitions in
quantum information processing. [24]

In this paper, the dissipative dynamics of the qubit-
resonator system is solved by master equation approach
and quantum regression theorem. [25] Comparing with
previous results, [15] the inﬂuence of the nonlinearity of
nanomechanical resonator on vacuum Rabi splitting ef-
fect is studied analytically and numerically.

In Sec.

The paper is organized as follows.

II, using
a driven nonlinear Jaynes-Cummings model, we describe
the dynamics of a qubit-resonator system consisting of a
superconducting qubit and a nonlinear nanomechanical
resonator. In Sec. III, the two-time correlation spectrum
is calculated analytically. In Sec. IV, vacuum Rabi split-
ting eﬀect is studied. Also numerical simulations conﬁrm
our analytical results. Finally, our conclusions are sum-
marized.

II. MODEL

In nanomechanical QED system, consisting a super-
conducting qubit and a nanomechanical resonator, we
can use a driven Jaynes-Cummings model to describe the
dynamics of this qubit-resonator system, [15]

H driven

JC

= ωaσ+σ− + g(cid:0)aσ+ + a†σ−(cid:1) + ωca†a

−ξ sin (ωpt)(cid:0)a + a†(cid:1) .

(1)

JC

Here H driven
is a driven Jaynes-Cummings type Hamil-
tonian. The lowering (raising) operator σ− (σ+) and the
annihilation (creation) operator a (a†) are deﬁned to de-
scribe the qubit with frequency ωa and the resonator with
frequency ωc respectively. The commutation relations,
[σ−, σ+] = σz and [a, a†] = 1, are satisﬁed. The last
term in Eq. (1) is a classical drive with driving constant
ξ and driving frequency ωp. The g denotes the interac-
tion strength between the qubit and the resonator.

Considering the nonlinearity of nanomechanical res-
onator, nanomechanical resonator is not assumed to be
an ideal resonator again. Moving into a frame with ro-
tating frequency ωp, the total Hamiltonian for this qubit-
resonator system writes [15]

Ht = ∆aσ+σ− + g(cid:0)aσ+ + a†σ−(cid:1) + ∆ca†a

−ξ(cid:0)a + a†(cid:1) + χa†a + χ(cid:0)a†a(cid:1)2

,

which describes the dynamics of a driven nonlinear
Jaynes-Cummings model. The linear part χa†a and non-
come from a quartic potential x4. [20]

Here the nonlinearity parameter χ is small, χ ≪ g.

linear part χ(cid:0)a†a(cid:1)2

(2)

Some parameters in the Hamiltonian Eq. (2) are

∆a = ωa − ωp, ∆c = ωc − ωp.

(3)

The detuning δ between the frequencies of the resonator
and the qubit is

δ = ∆c − ∆a.

III. TWO-TIME CORRELATION SPECTRUM

In previous results, [15] the induced electromotive force

between two ends of nanomechanical resonator is

V = iBlr ωc

2M

(a† − a).

(5)

To characterize the vacuum Rabi splitting in this
nanomechanical QED system, the two-time correlation
spectrum for the V is

SV (ω) =

1
π

ReZ ∞

0

dτ e−iωτ hV (τ )V (0)i .

(6)

Based on those results in Eqs. (5,6), the two-time corre-
lation function hV (τ )V (0)i writes

hV (τ )V (0)i ∝ (cid:10)a†(τ )a(0)(cid:11) +(cid:10)a(τ )a†(0)(cid:11)
− ha(τ )a(0)i −(cid:10)a†(τ )a†(0)(cid:11) .

(7)

Considering the interaction with the environment, we
use the master equation to describe dissipative dynamics
of the qubit-resonator system, [25]

˙ρ = −i [Ht, ρ] + κ(cid:0)2aρa† − a†aρ − ρa†a(cid:1)

(2σ−ρσ+ − σ+σ−ρ − ρσ+σ−) ,

+

γ
2

(8)

where the density operator ρ describes the time evolution
of the qubit-resonator system. The latter two terms in
Eq. (8) describe the decay process of the resonator and
the qubit respectively. The parameters κ and γ denote
the decay rates of the resonator and the qubit. Here the
Markov approximation is satisﬁed.

In this case, the number operator N = σ+σ− + a†a is
deﬁned to characterize the total number of excitations of
the qubit-resonator system. The operator N satisﬁes

N |j, ki = (j + k) |j, ki ,

where |j, ki = |ji ⊗ |ki is the state of the qubit-resonator
system, the index j (k) denotes the state of the qubit
(resonator) and satisﬁes σ+σ−|ji = j|ji (a†a|ki = k|ki)
for j = 0, 1 (k = 0, 1, ...).

In this paper, the weak driving limit is adopted, ξ →
0. When time approaches inﬁnite, t → ∞, the qubit-
resonator system will decay into the vacuum state |00i.
The weak driving ξ will induce the transitions from the

2

vacuum state |00i to the other excited states (|01i and
|10i). Under the lowest order perturbation theory, we
need to consider only one-phonon excitation in the qubit-
resonator system,

N = j + k = 0, 1.

(9)

The Hilbert space for the reduced density matrix ρ in
Eq. (8) reduces into a smaller subspace with a truncated
basis

{|j, ki , j + k = 0, 1} .

(10)

Thus, in this truncated basis, the corresponding den-
sity matrix elements satisfying the master equation in
Eq. (8) are

(11)

In the long-time limit, the system stays in a steady state,
we can take ρ00,00 ∼ 1 and ρ00,00 ≫ ρ01,01 (ρ10,10). Here
can see that ρ00,01 (ρ00,10) scales as the order of ξ and
ρ01,01 (ρ10,10) scales as the order of ξ2. Keeping terms of
the ξ and dropping the higher terms of the ξ2, we get

In the limit of weak driving, we can neglect the terms

which are proportional to the ξ2 in Eq. (22).

From the above results in Eq. (12), we can calculate

(16)

where ρ (0) = ρss and the index ss means the steady

IV. VACUUM RABI SPLITTING

Generally in vacuum Rabi splitting, the splitting fre-
quency ∆ω provides the information of the coupling g
between the qubit and the resonator. As seen in Eq. (23),
nonlinearity parameter χ modiﬁes the decay rate Γ1 (Γ2)
and central frequency ω1 (ω2) of two peaks in the spec-
trum SV (ω). And in the limit of weak driving, the ξ
does not aﬀect the spectrum SV (ω), it means that we
can use this driven nonlinear Jaynes-Cummings model to
characterize vacuum Rabi splitting eﬀect very well. The
corresponding splitting frequency between two peaks in
the spectrum SV (ω) is

∆ω = |ω1 − ω2| = 2ReG

(24)

which is independent of the driving strength ξ and de-
termined by the couple strength g, the detuning δ, decay
rate κ (γ) and nonlinearity parameter χ.

Assuming nanomechanical resonator as an ideal res-
onator, χ = 0, the spectrum SV (ω) in Eq. (23) will
be same as the previous results. [15] When the reso-
nant condition (δ = 0) and the strong-coupling limit
(g >> [κ, γ]) are adopted, we obtain the well-known
splitting frequency [4]

∆ω ≃ 2g.

(25)

To further clarify the dependence of correlation spec-
trum SV (ω) on nonlinearity parameter χ and the driv-
ing strength ξ more clearly, the resonant condition is
adopted, ∆a = ∆c = 1.0. The other parameters are
g = 0.2, κ = 0.004, γ = 0.004 and 1 GHz is taken as the
unit for all these parameters. [15, 24, 27]

Numerical calculations by QuTiP [28] are illustrated
with some plots in the following. In Fig. 1, we choose
the values of ξ = 0.02 and χ = 0.01, the increasing of
the number of total excitations N tells that the value of

SV (ω).

Figure 2 shows, in the limit of weak driving (ξ ≪ g),
there are two peaks in the spectrum and the increas-
ing of the driving strength does not aﬀect the spectrum
obviously, which conﬁrms the analytical calculations in
Eq. (23). Then we take the value of ξ = 0.02 in the
following plots.

As shown in Fig. 3, the increasing of nonlinearity pa-
rameter leads to the shift of central frequency of two
peaks dramatically and does not change the distance be-
tween the centers of two peaks obviously because nonlin-
earity parameter is much smaller than the coupling g, we
can see it in Eq. (24).

linearity parameter χ. These numerical results agree with

tain that the weak driving strength ξ does not change
the splitting frequency ∆ω, nonlinearity parameter χ
changes the heights of two peaks (Reη1 and Reη2) and
the shifts of central frequency (ω1 and ω2) obviously.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, vacuum Rabi splitting eﬀect is studied to
provided the information of the coupling g. Considering
the intrinsic nonlinearity in nanomechanical resonator, a
driven nonlinear Jaynes-Cummings model is used to de-
scribe the dynamics of the qubit-resonator system. Using
quantum regression theorem, the dissipative dynamics of
the qubit-resonator system is solved by master equation
approach. Here, the two-time correlation spectrum is an-
alytically calculated to clarify the dependence of correla-
tion spectrum on the driving strength ξ and nonlinearity
parameter χ. Because of small nonlinearity in nanome-
chanical resonator, we ﬁnd that nonlinearity parameter
leads to the shifts of central frequency (ω1 and ω2) and
does not change the splitting frequency ∆ω obviously.
In Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, numerical results plotted by QuTiP
agree with the analytical results in Eq. (23).
