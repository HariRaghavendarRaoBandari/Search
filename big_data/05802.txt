The existence of non-local quantum correlations is certainly the most important speciﬁc property
of the quantum world. However, it is a challenging task to distinguish correlations of classical origin
from genuine quantum correlations, especially when the system involves more than two parties, for
which diﬀerent partitions must be simultaneously considered. In the case of mixed states, inter-
mediate levels of correlations must be introduced, coined by the name inseparability. In this work,
we revisit in more detail such a concept in the context of continuous-variable quantum optics. We
consider a six-partite quantum state that we have eﬀectively generated by the parametric down-
conversion of a femtosecond frequency comb, the full 12 × 12 covariance matrix of which has been
experimentally determined. We show that, though this state does not exhibit ”genuine entangle-
ment”, it is undoubtedly multipartite-entangled. The consideration of not only the entanglement of
individual mode-decompositions but also of combinations of those solves the puzzle and exempliﬁes
the importance of studying diﬀerent categories of multipartite entanglement.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Entanglement appears nowadays as a major subject
of research in quantum physics, long after the pioneer-
ing contributions of Einstein, Podolsky, Rosen [1] and
Schr¨odinger [2].
It is the main quantum resource in a
vast number of applications in quantum information [3].
Entanglement witnesses can uncover such quantum cor-
relations [4, 5] in either discrete variables, when measure-
ments are made using photon counters, or in continuous
variables by employing homodyne detection, as far as
quantum states of light are concerned.

Pure entangled states have been ﬁrst considered in
bipartite systems. The case of mixed correlated states
turns out to be more involved, and an intermediate sit-
uation between factorized and entangled states has been
introduced, namely the separable states, which are sta-
tistical mixtures of factorized pure states [6]. A number
of entanglement probes for continuous-variable systems
have been studied [4, 5], the partial transpose test be-
ing among the most popular ways to pinpoint insepa-
rability. These criteria are in most cases suﬃcient but
not necessary to detect the diﬀerent levels of correlation.
The problem is simpler if one restricts oneself to bipar-
tite Gaussian states, for which the partial transposition
of the covariance matrix is a necessary and suﬃcient en-
tanglement identiﬁer [7–9].

The complexity of the separability problem increases
by a large amount when one wants to tackle the case of
three- or, more generally, multipartite systems. In these
situations one has a rapidly increasing number of choices
in the bunching of parties on which one searches for a

possible factorization. Hence, the inseparability between
the individual degrees of freedom exhibits a much richer
and complex structure which begins to be studied [10–
12]. For example, the diﬀerence between bipartite and
multipartite systems is highlighted by the existence of
multimode Gaussian states whose entanglement cannot
be uncovered by the partial transposition [13, 14].

As a special case, combinations of all possible biparti-
tions of the total system have been the subject of many
studies. A state which is not a statistical mixture of
bipartite factorized density matrices is called in the liter-
ature “genuinely” multipartite entangled. The detection
of genuine entanglement is at the focus of attention [15–
23]. This interest can be explained by the fact that gen-
uine entanglement implies multipartite entanglement for
every other separation of the modes. However, if a state
does not exhibit this speciﬁc kind of entanglement, no
further conclusions on other forms of multipartite quan-
tum correlations can be drawn. Thus, it is certainly in-
dispensable to study what happens beyond genuine en-
tanglement. This is the subject of the present paper.

On the experimental side of continuous-variable quan-
tum optics, multipartite quantum correlated states have
been ﬁrst produced by mixing, in an appropriate way,
diﬀerent squeezed states on beam splitters [24]. More re-
cently, multimode Gaussian states (either spatial or fre-
quency modes) have been directly generated by a mul-
timode optical nonlinear device [25, 26].
In the multi-
frequency case, the experimental determination of the
full covariance matrix of a ten-mode “quantum frequency
comb” has allowed to uncover the complex structure of its
quantum properties, and in particular the entanglement
of all its possible partitions. [27–29].

In this paper, we will characterize states which are not
genuinely entangled and yet exhibit a rich multipartite
entanglement structure. In order to achieve this, we will

2

formulate diﬀerent notions of separability and entangle-
ment, then we will provide a method to qualify them
in a general case. Using such a theoretical method, we
will uncover the structure of multimode entanglement in
a six-mode Gaussian state that has been produced ex-
perimentally. Using multimode parametric downconver-
sion of a femtosecond frequency comb source, we gener-
ate such a highly multimode quantum state of light that
spans on many frequency modes. Even though this state
does not exhibit genuine entanglement, it is shown to
include all other forms of higher-order entanglement.

II. COMBINATIONS OF MODAL PARTITIONS

We consider multimode states which are based on a
N -fold tensor product Hilbert space H = H1 ⊗ . . .⊗HN ,
where Hj is the local Hilbert space of the j-th mode. A
particular K-partition I1: . . . :IK decomposes the set of
modes, {1, . . . , N}, into K non-empty, disjoint subsets
Ik (for k = 1, . . . , K). We will call such a partition an
individual K-partition.
The corresponding pure factorized states are product
states, |sI1:...:IK(cid:105) = |aI1(cid:105)⊗. . .⊗|aIK(cid:105), consisting of states
Hj. Subsequently, a continuous-variable,
mixed I1: . . . :IK-separable state is deﬁned as

|aIk(cid:105) ∈(cid:78)

j∈Ik

ˆσI1:...:IK =

dP (sI1:...:IK )|sI1:...:IK(cid:105)(cid:104)sI1:...:IK|,

(1)

(cid:90)

where P is a classical probability distribution over the
set of pure (continuous-variable) separable states.

A state is called K-separable if it can be written as a
statistical mixture of separable states with respect to the
diﬀerent K-partitions I1: . . . :IK,

ˆσK =

pI1:...:IK ˆσI1:...:IK ,

(2)

(cid:88)

I1:...:IK

where pI1:...:IK are probabilities and ˆσI1:...:IK are the cor-
responding I1: . . . :IK-separable states in Eq. (1). We will
refer to this combination of individual K-partitions as
convex combination of K-partitions. A state is called K-
entangled if it cannot be written in the manner speciﬁed
in Eq. (2). In particular, a state which is not “bisepa-
rable” (K = 2) is precisely the “genuinely multipartite
entangled state” studied in the literature.

Figure 1 shows the diﬀerent kinds of separability (or
entanglement) in the tripartite scenario, N = 3. The cir-
cles represent pure states, which are the extremal points
of the convex hull of separable states with respect to
given partitionings. A state lying outside of these sets
are entangled in that particular notion. For K = 3, we
have the statistical mixture of pure, fully separable states
|s{1}:{2}:{3}(cid:105) (red, left pattern in top row of Fig. 1). For
K = 1, we trivially get all states (blue, right pattern).

The partitions for K = 2 (green) consist of three in-
dividual bipartitions, shown in the middle row of Fig. 1.
The (green) circle on the top-left corresponds to a pure

FIG. 1. (Color online) Partitionings of a tripartite system.
The circles, ◦,
indicate pure state representatives for dif-
ferent notions of separability/entanglement (distinguished by
the lightness[color]). The top row depicts the convex sets of
K-partitions. The K=2 case is a convex combination of the
individual bipartitions I1:I2, which are given in the pattern
in the middle row. The bottom shows the overlay of the in-
dividual bipartitions (dashed bordered sets) as an inset into
the convex set of all bipartitions (solid borders). The target
state (cid:63) is a convex combination of 2-partite separable states.
It is therefore not genuinely entangled, but 3-entangled.

state |s{1,2}:{3}(cid:105), which is not of the form |s{1}:{2}:{3}(cid:105),
|s{1,2}:{3}(cid:105), or |s{1,3}:{2}(cid:105). Thus,
it is entangled with
respect to those notions of separability. Similarly, the
(green) circle on the top-right and the two (green) middle
circles are exclusively separable with respect to the indi-
vidual partition {1}:{2, 3} and {1, 3}:{2}, respectively.
All of them are certainly K = 2-separable in the convex
combination of all bipartitions.
In the bottom row of Fig. 1, we also show the three in-
dividual bipartitions {1, 2}:{3}, {1, 3}:{2}, and {1}:{2, 3}
(dashed borders) included into the convex combination of
biseparable states (solid border). Our target state (indi-
cated by a star) is entangled with respect to all individ-
ual bipartitions, but it is separable with respect to the
convex combination of bipartitions. These states are par-
ticularly interesting as they are not genuine multipartite
entangled. We will show explicitly for a six-partite sys-
tem, N = 6, that such states still exhibit rich multipartite
entanglement properties.

III. ENTANGLEMENT CRITERIA FOR

CONVEX COMBINATIONS

A criterion for detecting entanglement of states is
based on the entanglement witnesses [30].
It can be
formulated as follows: A state is entangled if a Hermi-

tian operator ˆL exists, whose expectation value is smaller
than the minimal attainable value for all separable states
ˆσ [31],

3
covariance matrix of a Gaussian state, assuming (cid:104) ˆξj(cid:105) = 0.
Thus, the most general form of a Gaussian test operator
ˆL is the quadratic combination

(cid:104) ˆL(cid:105) < inf

ˆσ

{tr( ˆLˆσ)}.

(3)

ˆL =

ˆξi

ˆξj,

This criterion is general and covers any kind of insepara-
bility. It applies therefore to either individual partitions
or convex combinations. Using this result and the follow-
ing property,

The equation labels over the equal signs indicates that
those equations have been used for rewriting.
The minimization of (cid:104)sI1:...:IK| ˆL|sI1:...:IK(cid:105) for pure,
I1: . . . :IK-separables states has been treated in Ref. [31].
There, so-called “separability eigenvalue equations” have
been derived. The solution of those equations for a given
observable ˆL yields the minimal separability eigenvalue
gminI1:...:IK
, which is also the desired inﬁmum for separa-
ble states of the individual K-partition I1: . . . :IK. We
can conclude: A state is inseparable with respect to the
convex combination of all K-partitions (K-entangled), if
and only if there exists a Hermitian operator ˆL, such that

(cid:104) ˆL(cid:105) < gmin

K = min

Although this condition clearly diﬀers from the approach
for individual partitions [29], it is remarkable that we can
use a similar calculus. The method of separability eigen-
values was introduced to uncover entanglement of indi-
[31].
It serves now for detecting entanglement among convex
combinations of all K-partitions [inequality (5)].

IV. WITNESSING MULTIMODE GAUSSIAN

STATES

A Gaussian state is fully described by its covariance

matrix. In the following, we will use the notation

ˆξ = (ˆx1, . . . , ˆxN , ˆp1, . . . , ˆpN )T

(6)

for a vector containing the amplitude (ˆxj) and phase (ˆpj)
quadratures of all possible modes (j = 1, . . . , N ). The
covariance matrix C of a Gaussian state can be written
in terms of the symmetrically ordered elements C ij =
(cid:104) ˆξi
ˆξi(cid:105)/2 − (cid:104) ˆξi(cid:105)(cid:104) ˆξj(cid:105). As local displacements do not
aﬀect the entanglement, it is suﬃcient to analyze the

ˆξj + ˆξj

with a symmetric, positive deﬁnite 2N × 2N -matrix
M = (Mij)2N
i,j=1. Note that Williamson’s theorem al-
lows us to diagonalize such a matrix M into a form
diag(λ1, . . . , λN , λ1, . . . , λN ) in terms of symplectic op-
erations, see, e.g., [32].
an individual partition I1: . . . :IK is given by [29]:

Material of Ref. [29]). Finally, the entanglement condi-
tion (5) is given by the bound

in Eq. (8)(cid:9) .

Hence, we have formulated an inﬁnite number (for
any positive, symmetric matrix M ) of multipartite K-
entanglement probes in an analytical form. This includes
as a subclass Gaussian tests for genuine entanglement,
K=2 > (cid:104) ˆL(cid:105), which have been recently studied [23].
gmin
In order to get the best entanglement signature of all
test operators ˆL in terms of matrices M [Eq. (7)], we take
the analytical solutions in Eqs. (8) and (9) and numeri-
cally minimize the signed signiﬁcances:

ΣI1:...:IK =

(cid:104) ˆL(cid:105) − gminI1:...:IK

∆(cid:104) ˆL(cid:105)

and ΣK =

(cid:104) ˆL(cid:105) − gmin

K

∆(cid:104) ˆL(cid:105)

,

(10)
where ∆(cid:104) ˆL(cid:105) denotes the experimental error of (cid:104) ˆL(cid:105), by
ﬁnding the optimal matrix M for each of those signiﬁ-
cances. The signed signiﬁcance is negative, Σχ < 0, if
the state is entangled with respect to the given notion
of separability, χ = K or χ = I1: . . . :IK, which is certi-
ﬁed with a signiﬁcance of |Σχ|-standard deviations. The
numerical minimization was performed with a genetic al-
gorithm [29] which can, in principle, not only ﬁnd local
minima, but also global ones [33]. Hence, one could claim
that a positive value Σχ corresponds to a χ-separable co-
variance matrix. However, we will more carefully state
in such a case that no χ-entanglement can be detected.

V. CHARACTERIZATION OF THE SPOPO

MULTIMODE QUANTUM STATE

The details on the experimental generation and the
characterization of the produced state in terms of uncor-

related squeezed “supermodes” can be found in Refs. [27]
and [28]. The light under study is a femtosecond fre-
quency comb of zero mean value spanning over roughly
∼ 105 individual equally spaced frequency components,
generated by parametric down conversion of a pump fre-
quency comb in a synchronously pumped optical para-
metric oscillator (SPOPO).

It is analyzed through a series of balanced homodyne
detections that use diﬀerent pulse shaped local oscillators
of adjustable spectrum. This allowed us to experimen-
tally determine the full covariance matrix C, containing
the noise variances in diﬀerent frequency bands covering
the whole spectrum of the SPOPO state, as well as the
correlations between them. Assuming a Gaussian dis-
tribution of the quantum ﬂuctuations, a reasonable as-
sumption in the present situation, one retrieves in such
a way the full information about the generated quantum
state, at least within the frequency resolution given by
the width of the frequency bands used in the measure-
ments. For the experiment described here, the spectrum
was partitioned into six bands of equal energy, which al-
lowed us to determine the 144 matrix elements C ij of the
12 × 12 covariance matrix together with the correspond-
ing experimental uncertainties ∆C ij.

Uncorrelated supermodes, i.e., well deﬁned combina-
tions of frequency modes corresponding to femtosecond
pulses of speciﬁc shapes [34], were extracted from the
matrix. They have squeezing levels between −2.6 dB and
+3.0 dB. The generated state is clearly mixed, as its pu-
rity, trˆρ2 = (det C)−1/2 = 86.4%, is below one.

VI. ENTANGLEMENT STRUCTURE OF A

SIX-MODE SPOPO STATE

For an N =6-mode state, 203 possible individual parti-
tions exist. That is one trivial partition I1 = {1, . . . , 6},
31 bipartitions I1:I2, 90 tripartitions, 65 four-partitions,
15 ﬁve-partitions, and one six-partition {1}: . . . :{6}.
Hence, we have six convex combinations of K-partitions.
The results of our analysis are shown in Fig. 2 in terms
of the minimized signed signiﬁcances in Eq. (10). The
trivial partition K = 1 yields ΣK=1 > 0, which means
that the measured covariance is a physical one. The value
ΣK=2 > 0 shows that no detectable genuine entangle-
ment exist in the SPOPO quantum frequency comb. Yet,
for all K ≥ 3, K-entanglement is veriﬁed with a signiﬁ-
cance of at least seven standard deviations, ΣK>2 < −7.
Such types of multipartite entanglement are not accessi-
ble with entanglement probes that are only sensitive to
genuine entanglement.
Considering the circles in the insets for 1 ≤ K ≤ 6
in Fig. 2, it can be seen that the same six-mode state is
entangled with respect to all nontrivial, individual parti-
tions – even for K = 2. Therefore, the SPOPO state is
entangled with respect to any individual bipartition, even
though it cannot be identiﬁed as a genuinely entangled
state: The subtle structures of multipartite entanglement

The insets for 2 ≤ K ≤ 5 give the values for the individual

better visibility, the positive part of the ordinate has a dif-
ferent scaling than the negative (entangled) part. Despite no
signature of genuine entanglement, Σ2 > 0, the state shows

are invisible for genuine entanglement probes.
Here, we see clearly that entanglement of some or even
all individual partitions I1: . . . :IK of the length K does
not necessarily imply K-entanglement. Rather, it is the
convex combination of the individual partitions that is
responsible for the separability or inseparability. The
inverse, however, is true: K-entanglement implies entan-
glement with respect to all individual K-partitions. This
follows from the condition (5) by taking a proper test op-
erator ˆL for the convex combination and the same ˆL for
every individual K-partition, as gmin
. Let us
ﬁnally stress that this approach can be extended to study
other convex combinations of some individual partitions
which are not limited by a ﬁxed K-value.

VII. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

We have studied diﬀerent forms of K-party entangle-
ment in multimode states. An analytical approach to
construct the corresponding entanglement tests was de-
rived and further elaborated for covariance based entan-
glement probes. To optimize over the resulting inﬁnite
set of all analytical Gaussian witnesses, a numerical op-
timization was performed. This approach allows us to
classify entanglement in Gaussian states with an arbi-
trary number of modes.

We then focused on the characterization of K-partite
entanglement of multi-mode Gaussian states, that we ap-
plied to a parametrically generated multimode frequency
comb. It was shown for a six-mode example that our sys-
tem shows an interesting form of entanglement, though it
did not exhibit genuine multipartite entanglement. That
is, the SPOPO state turns out to be a biseparable state
which is K-entangled for any K=3, . . . , 6. Moreover, we
detected entanglement with respect to all individual par-

5

titions, even all the individual bipartitions. Thus, the
absence of genuine entanglement does not give much in-
sight into the entanglement structure.

This work proves the great interest to investigate the
nature of entanglement beyond genuine entanglement in
highly multipartite systems. A lot of questions remain to
be investigated concerning other possible types of multi-
partite entanglement and in particular their relation to
quantum tasks in various types of quantum computing
protocols. Our construction of more general entangle-
ment criteria, likely to access multipartite quantum cor-

relations beyond bipartitions, provides a good starting
tool to tackle such problems.

As a comment to the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen para-
dox [1], Schr¨odinger emphasized that a compound quan-
tum system includes more information than provided by
the individual subsystems [2]. Considering our scenario
at hand, we may extend such a statement. Namely, mul-
tipartite entanglement is much richer than one can infer
from the genuine entanglement of bipartitions.
