Abstract—This work considers energy management in a grid-
connected microgrid which consists of multiple conventional gen-
erators (CGs), renewable generators (RGs) and energy storage
systems (ESSs). A two-stage optimization approach is presented
to schedule the power generation, aimed at minimizing the long-
term average operating cost subject to operational and service
constraints. The ﬁrst stage of optimization determines hourly
unit commitment of the CGs via a day-ahead scheduling, and
the second stage performs economic dispatch of the CGs, ESSs
and energy trading via an hour-ahead scheduling. The combined
solution meets the need of handling large uncertainties in the
load demand and renewable generation, and provides an efﬁcient
solution under limited computational resource which meets both
short-term and long-term quality-of-service requirements. The
performance of the proposed strategy is evaluated by simulations
based on real load demand and renewable generation data.

I. INTRODUCTION

Microgrids are considered as promising ingredients for
smart grids to integrate renewable energies in a reliable and
economic manner. As renewable resources are dynamic and
stochastic in nature, the energy management of microgrids be-
comes challenging and critical. This drives extensive research
to resolve the challenges confronted [1]. As a key step, it
is important to establish a reliable model of the microgrids
that best describes the underlying physics. Various models
have been developed in the literature which often ignore
or oversimplify certain complicate operational constraints,
such as the start-up/shut-down cost, minimum on/off time
and limited ramp up/down rate of conventional generators
(CGs), the imperfect charging/discharging processes of energy
storage systems (ESSs) and the associated aging cost, the
forecast errors of the load demand and the generation of
renewable generators (RGs). By using the simpliﬁed models,
various energy management systems have been developed in
favor of their own approaches while maintaining technical
tractability [2]–[7]. However, this leaves questions on their
actual performances because the effects of the ignored com-
plicate constraints are largely unexamined. Considering such a
situation, it is of importance to re-think about the management
system design based on a more accurate microgrid model
which takes the realistic features and constraints into account.
This work makes an effort in this direction. We consider a
microgrid consisting of multiple RGs, CGs and ESSs, which
works in a grid-connected mode and can trade energy with the

external market. We develop an energy management approach
which ﬁrst schedules the unit commitment (UC) of the CGs in
a day-ahead manner and then conducts economic dispatch of
the CGs, ESSs and energy trading in an hour-ahead manner.
The UC is aimed at minimizing the whole-day operating cost
using the day-ahead hourly forecast of the load demand, re-
newable supply and electricity prices. The forecast errors could
be large due to variations and uncertainties in the demand and
renewable energy generation. As a result, the solution obtained
may deviate much from the ideal optimal solution. This
motivates the real-time economic dispatch which maintains
the UC solution but uses more accurate one-hour forecast data
to optimize the generation. Furthermore, the dispatch solution
approximately optimizes the long-term average operating cost
of the microgrid while meeting both a short-term and a long-
term quality-of-service (QoS) requirement in addition to the
operational constraints. Because it only assumes unbiased and
bounded errors in the forecast data, the dispatch solution also
avoids the need of identifying probability distributions of the
errors and enables a simple implementation.

Unlike the existing literature,

the microgrid model we
develop includes all typical components integrated in a ﬂexible
manner, and keeps almost all major features and realistic oper-
ational constraints of each component, as brieﬂy mentioned at
the beginning. We also distinguish elastic from inelastic load
demand, of which the former can be curtailed or shifted while
the latter must be satisﬁed. The long-term average curtailment
is required to be below a given percentage. The mismatch
between the scheduled generation and the load demand is
penalized, which mimics the compensation for the degraded
service to electricity users and the adjustment cost induced to
electricity providers. The joint consideration of these practical
aspects leads to the new problem formulation and motivates
the development of our unique two-stage approach for obtain-
ing a solution.

The day-ahead UC and the hour-ahead economic dispatch
are formulated and solved as mixed-integer programs (MIPs)
at the ﬁrst and second stages, respectively. We set up a virtual
microgrid and conduct simulations based on real trace data.
The achieved economic performances are compared between
the proposed strategy founded on a realistic microgrid model
and its variants that assume simpliﬁed models. The value
is justiﬁed, and some
of adopting a more realistic model
discussions are made based on the new observations.
Notation. We use NCG, NRG and NESS to denote the sets
of CGs, RGs and ESSs, respectively. Given a scalar x, the term
(x)+ equals max{x, 0}. The time is discretized into slots as

indicated by 0, 1, ..., T −1 and collected in the set T , where T
is the length of the planning time horizon. Each time slot refers
to a period of one hour. The words “energy” and “power”
are used interchangeably whenever the energy is meant for a
single time slot. Boldface and normal letters are used to denote
vectors and scalars, respectively, and “w.r.t.” (or “s.t.”) is an
abbreviation for “with respect to” (or “subject to”). The rest
notation is deﬁned in the context when it ﬁrst appears.

II. MODELING THE MICROGRID

This section models each component of a microgrid by

describing its cost function and operational constraints.

A. CG Model

Consider a CG i ∈ NCG in time slot t ∈ T . Let its on/off
status be indicated by 1/0 of ui,t, and its power output be
scheduled as pi,t. Its operating cost consists of the start-up cost
i,t(pi,t) and maintenance
csu
i
cost C m
i,t(pi,t), of which the ﬁrst two appear only if the relevant
operations occur. The total cost is thus expressed as
Ci,t(ui,t−1, ui,t, pi,t) = csu

, shut-down cost csd

i ui,t−1(1 − ui,t)

i , fuel cost C f

i ui,t(1 − ui,t−1) + csd
+ C f
i,t(pi,t),

i,t(pi,t) + Cm

i,t(0) = 0 [8]. The CG emits
where we have assumed that C m
carbon gases when it is on, and the amount is estimated as
Ei(pi,t). The actual amount is thus expressed as ui,tEi(pi,t).
The operation of the CG must satisfy a couple of operational

constraints. Its output power is bounded as,
ui,tpi,min ≤ pi,t ≤ ui,tpi,max,

(1)

where pi,min and pi,max are the lower and upper bounds,
respectively. The power outputs of two sequential time slots
cannot change too much, that is,

|pi,t − pi,t−1| ≤ ripi,max

(2)
where ri ∈ (0, 1] is the ramp rate coefﬁcient. Also, the CG
must remain on (or off) in time slot t if the duration of the
on (or off) status, denoted by ton
i,t), is less than a given
amount of time, denoted by T on
i,min). This calls for
the following minimum on/off time constraints [8]:

i,t (or toff
i,min (or T off

i,min

i,min

(cid:1) (ui,t−1 − ui,t) ≥ 0,
(cid:1) (ui,t − ui,t−1) ≥ 0.

(3)

B. RG Model

The RGs are assumed to be kept on and non-dispatchable. It
is sufﬁcient to model their aggregate power output, denoted by
pRG,t for each time slot t, which is stochastic in time. Since
the true value of pRG,t for a future time slot t is unknown, it
is assumed to be estimated as ˆpRG,t, which is unbiased and
has a bounded error as follows:

E{ˆpRG,t} = pRG,t, |ˆpRG,t − pRG,t| ≤ δRG,t,

(4)
where the symbol E is the expectation operator and δRG,t is
a given bound of the forecast error.

Let the charge and discharge rates of ESS i be scheduled as

discharged (or not charged). These variables satisfy

where pc
i,max are the corresponding upper bounds.
The two constraints ensure that charge and discharge comply
with the rate limits and do not happen in the same time slot.
After charge/discharge, the state of charge (SOC) of the ESS,
denoted by si,t, changes and renews into
i,t/ηd

(6)
si,t = si,t−1 + (ηc
i ∈ (0, 1] are the energy conversion coefﬁcients,
where ηc

in time slot t is thus given by

i,t) + C d

D. Load Demand Model

The demand is either inelastic or elastic load, which must
be satisﬁed and can be curtailed/shifted, respectively. Let their
aggregate amounts be die,t and de,t in time slot t, respectively,
satisfying de,t ≥ de,min > 0 for a certain constant de,min. If
part of the elastic demand is unsatisﬁed, it incurs a shortage
cost to compensate the affected customers. Likewise, if the
generation exceeds the total demand, it incurs a cost to adjust
generation for balancing supply with demand. The shortage (or
surplus) cost is denoted by Cshort,t(xt) (or Csurp,t(xt)), which
is zero if the shortage (or surplus) amount xt is equal to 0.

Let the demands die,t and de,t be forecasted as ˆdie,t and ˆde,t,
respectively, and the forecast errors satisfy the next conditions:

E{ ˆdie,t} = die,t, | ˆdie,t − die,t| ≤ δie,t,
E{ ˆde,t} = de,t, | ˆde,t − de,t| ≤ δe,t,

(8)

where δie,t and δe,t are the given error bounds. For conve-
nience, we also deﬁne the net demand as dnet,t (cid:44) die,t +
de,t − pRG,t, with a corresponding forecast value ˆdnet,t (cid:44)
ˆdie,t + ˆde,t − ˆpRG,t and the associated error bound δnet,t (cid:44)
δie,t + δe,t + δRG,t. And let δnet,max (cid:44) maxt∈T δnet,t.
E. Interaction with External Energy Market

The microgrid is connected to a host power system and can
trade energy with the external energy market. Let the energy
purchase and sale prices be given as cb,t and cs,t for time slot
t, respectively, which satisfy 0 < cp,min ≤ cp,t ≤ cp,max and
0 < cs,min ≤ cs,t ≤ cs,max. To avoid trading arbitrage, we

assume that cp,t > cs,t (otherwise, the microgrid will always
purchase and then sell the same energy to make proﬁt). Let
the amount of energy to purchase and sell be scheduled as pp,t
and ps,t, respectively, as are bounded by,

0 ≤ pp,t ≤ pp,max, 0 ≤ ps,t ≤ ps,max,

(9)
where pp,max and ps,max are the transaction limits in one time
slot. The transaction incurs the following cost to the microgrid:

Cm,t(pp,t, ps,t) = cp,tpp,t − cs,tps,t.

Minimization of this cost implies pp,tps,t = 0, i.e., purchase
and sale of energy do not happen in the same time slot.
F. Service Requirements

The microgrid needs to meet some QoS requirements.
The dispatchable power generation from the CGs, ESSs and
energy market must meet the inelastic demand minus the non-
dispatchable generation from the RGs, but not exceed an upper
bound of the net demand. Also, both the maximum and the
average percentages of unsatisﬁed elastic demand must not
exceed the levels given by αmax and αavg, respectively.

Deﬁne the dispatchable supply as

pi,t +

i∈NCG

i∈NESS

i,t − pc
(pd

i,t) + pp,t − ps,t, (10)
and let pt (cid:44) pdisp,t + pRG,t, which is the total energy
generation. The aforementioned QoS requirements impose
three constraints for each time slot t: die,t − pRG,t ≤
pdisp,t ≤ ˆdnet,t + δnet,t,
and
≤ αavg, where the
lim sup
T→∞
two scalars satisfy 0 ≤ αavg ≤ αmax < 1 (the time-average
constraint becomes redundant if αavg = αmax).

is the tightest bound derived by using (4) and (8). These
constraints are more complicated than the QoS constraints
used in the literature [6], [7], because of taking the forecast
errors of load demand and renewable generation into account.
In addition, the total carbon emission of the microgrid in
each time slot t must not exceed a given amount Mt, namely,
(13)

ui,tEi(pi,t) ≤ Mt,

(cid:88)

and the microgrid must maintain a predeﬁned operating re-
serve, Rt, to prepare for meeting emergent demand, i.e.,

(pi,max − pi,t) ≥ Rt.

III. PROBLEM FORMULATION

The operation of the microgrid is reviewed periodically.
Each review aims to schedule the power generations of the
CGs, the charge/discharge rates of the ESSs and the trading
with the external power market to minimize the time-average
operating cost of the microgrid, subject to constraints (1)-
(14). Some of the constraints are nonlinear, which make
the optimization complex. Before presenting the optimization
problem, we introduce linearizations of the nonlinear terms
and constraints to enable a more efﬁcient solution process.
A. Linearization of Nonlinear Terms/Constraints

First,

introduce a binary variable vi,t satisfying vi,t =
ui,t−1ui,t, for each i ∈ NCG and t ∈ T . Then the CG cost
Ci,t(ui,t−1, ui,t, pi,t) has an equivalent form which is linear
in ui,t:

Ci,t(ui,t, vi,t, pi,t) = csu

i (ui,t − vi,t) + csd
+ C f

i (pi,t) + C m

i (pi,t),

i (ui,t−1 − vi,t)

where the symbol Ci,t has been abused to denote the new cost
function. Under minimization of the above cost, the nonlinear
equality condition on vi,t is equivalent to
vi,t ≤ ui,t−1, vi,t ≤ ui,t,

(15)

which is a linear inequality for each i ∈ NCG and t ∈ T .

Second, because ui,t − vi,t and ui,t−1 − vi,t are indicators
of whether the CG i is started up or shut down at the start of
time slot t, respectively, the minimum on/off time constraints
(3) can be reformulated as the following linear inequalities:

ui,τ ≥ ui,t − vi,t, ∀ 1 ≤ τ − t ≤ T on
i,min − 1,
ui,τ ≤ 1 − (ui,t−1 − vi,t), ∀ 1 ≤ τ − t ≤ T off

i,min − 1,

(16)

for each i ∈ NCG and t ∈ T .
Third, the supply shortage and surplus cost functions can
be written more explicitly as Cshort,t(wt) and Csurp,t(pdisp,t −
ˆdnet,t + wt), where wt is the amount of shortage satisfying:

wt ≥ 0, wt ≥ ˆdnet,t − pdisp,t.

(17)

This is valid under the minimization of the two costs.
B. The Energy Management Optimization Problem

t , (pc

Let ut (cid:44) (ui,t) for all i ∈ NCG, which is a column vector
collecting the on/off status variables of all CGs in time slot
t, and πt (cid:44) [pT

power variables of time slot t. The vectors are deﬁned as pt

i ∈ NESS. We also let zt (cid:44) [wt, vT

all auxiliary variables, where vt (cid:44) (vi,t) for all i ∈ NCG,
i,t) for all i ∈ NESS. The energy management

(18)
Problem P0 has a time-average cost function, a time-average
load service constraint and a couple of operational constraints
with real and binary decision variables. These all make the
problem hard to be solved exactly. A sub-optimal solution is
thus explored in the next section which integrates an ofﬂine
and an online solution.

IV. APPROXIMATE SOLUTION APPROACH

The start-up and shut-down costs and time coupling con-
straints make it difﬁcult to optimize a CG’s generation online.
This motivates us to determine its hourly on/off status (i.e.,
the UC solution) day ahead, and to optimize the speciﬁc
supplies from the CGs, ESSs and external market hour ahead
while respecting the UC solution. This leads to a two-stage
optimization approach for obtaining a sub-optimal solution to
P0. The ﬁrst-stage optimization is solved as an MIP with a 24-
hour horizon, and the second-stage is reduced to an MIP with
a one-hour horizon by applying the Lyapunov optimization
method. Each of the two MIPs can be an MILP or MINLP,
depending on the sub-cost functions in (18).

A. Day-ahead UC

The present purpose is to determine the UC solution for
each CG to be implemented in the next day. With the forecast
of electricity demand and renewable supply available for the
next day, we solve P0 with T = 24 h. The parameter
αmax is temporally set to the value of αavg for computing a
conservative schedule to tackle the uncertainties in the forecast
data. In the optimization, we ensure that constraints (2), (6),
(15) and (16), which interlace variables of two neighboring
days, are correctly enforced by using the values of relevant
variables realized in the last day. The resulting problem is an
MIP and can be solved ofﬂine by standard solvers.

t , z∗

a 24 h of interest. We then keep the UC solution {u∗
t}t∈T ,
but re-optimize the remaining solution by using more accurate
one-hour forecast data in the next stage.

Suppose the full solution is obtained as {u∗

B. Real-time Economic Dispatch

Because of variations and uncertainties in the demand and
renewable supply,
the energy generation scheduled in the
ﬁrst stage may deviate much from the optimal solution. To
mitigate the deviation, we proceed to re-optimize the energy
generation using the more accurate hour-ahead forecast data
while maintaining the UC solution obtained in the ﬁrst stage.
To respect the UC solution obtained in the ﬁrst stage, we
need to enforce the following constraint in this real-time stage:

pi,t ≤ τi,tripi,max,

(19)

4

if a CG i has been scheduled to be on at time t until t + τi,t,
where τi,t is the duration of the on status. This constraint
ensures that it is feasible in the online stage for the CG to
decrease its generation to zero at a time scheduled in the ﬁrst
stage, without violating the ramp rate constraint given in (2).
1) Solution via Lyapunov optimization: The Lyapunov op-
timization method is mainly developed to solve optimization
problems with a time-averaged objective and time-average
equality/inequality constraints, in which the decision variables
are constrained in some implicit sets that depend only on the
present time slot [9]. To apply the method, we ignore the ramp
rate constraint (2) that crosses two time slots but will restore it
later to enforce feasibility, and also to relax the SOC constraint
E{si,T −βi} = 0, where βi > 0 and its value
(7) as limT→∞ 1
T
needs to be selected appropriately.

Virtual queues for the time-averaged terms are carefully
deﬁned based on the Lyapunov optimization method. To
meet the time-average service constraint (12), a virtual queue
backlog Qt is introduced which evolves as follows:
− αavg, 0

It accumulates the percentage of unsatisﬁed elastic demand.
Meanwhile, to meet the relaxed SOC constraint, which is
a time-average constraint on the charge and discharge rates,
another virtual queue backlog Si,t is deﬁned for each i ∈
NESS which evolves as follows:

Si,t = Si,t−1 + qi,t = si,t − βi,
i,t − pd

where qi,t (cid:44) (ηc

the SOC, and the parameter βi is selected such that the SOC
value si,t can be controlled within the given limits without
imposing the original SOC constraint.

The derivations of βi and Vmax are motivated by the recent

respectively identically and independently distributed over all
time slots, as was similarly done with a simpliﬁed microgrid
model in [6]. Since in reality this assumption is not satisﬁed
in general, we rely on simulations instead to evaluate the
performance of the obtained sub-optimal schedule.

V. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

This section sets up a virtual microgrid and conducts
simulations with real trace data. The objectives are two folds:
(i) corroborating the empirical performance of the proposed
energy management approach under demand and supply un-
certainties; and (ii) investigating the impacts of employing
oversimpliﬁed component models on the generation schedule
and the economic performance.

A. The Microgrid Setup

The simulated microgrid has one wind farm, three CGs and
two ESSs, and it interacts with an external energy market.
The speciﬁcations of these components are given below. The
units of mass, time, power, energy and cost are in kg, h, kW,
kWh and $ (US), respectively, unless otherwise speciﬁed. The
parameter V is set to Vmax as computed per (23).

RGs: The RGs mimic a group of wind turbines that form
a wind farm. The aggregate power trace is extracted from a
wind farm in California for one summer week [10], and then
scaled to a maximum output of 1.2 MW, as shown in Fig. 1.
The aggregate output power in each time slot is assumed to
be forecasted with a zero-mean error that follows a uniform
distribution. The maximum error is proportional to the absolute
change in the output power of the time slot w.r.t. that of the
previous time slot, and the proportion coefﬁcient is increasing
in the forecast horizon. Further, the error is capped within 80%
of the minimum and 120% of the maximum output powers.
CGs: There are three CGs, with aggregate output power up
to 3 MW. Their parameters are given in Table I [11], and their
cost and carbon emission functions are given in Table II [12].
ESSs: The two ESSs are composed of small Li-ion batteries,
and their speciﬁcations are given in Table III. The charging and
discharging cost functions are approximated by three piece-
wise linear functions, which were experimentally obtained for
a Li-ion battery with a capacity of 8.1 W [13]. Each cost
function accounts for the battery’s life loss in terms of the
initial purchase cost. When the operation is updated at a period
of one hour, the cost has the following explicit form:

where ci is the unit capital cost ($/Wh) to purchase the ESS
i; zi is an auxiliary variable; γi is the fraction of a single
cyclic aging cost incurred by fully charging the battery from
empty; and ni (cid:44) Ei,cap/0.0081, which is the number of battery
modules that form the ESS i, each with a capacity of 0.0081
kW. The battery’s price ci is divided by 0.8 because in practice
a battery typically needs to be replaced if its useable capacity
drops down to 20% of its original capacity. The inequality
constraints are essential to enforce the piece-wise linear aging
models, and the coefﬁcient (ak, bk) takes the values of (0.0020
h, 0.0086 Wh), (0.0026 h, 0.0060 Wh) and (0.0134 h, -0.0884

Wh) for k equal to 1, 2 and 3, respectively [13]. In the
simulations, we set c1 = c2 = 0.25 $/Wh (which is the ESS
price pursued in the next few years [14]), and γ1 = γ2 = 0.5,
and the initial SOCs as s1,0 = 0.5 and s2,0 = 0.6 for the two
ESSs with the smaller and the larger capacities, respectively.
Energy market: The price of buying electricity from the
energy market is obtained from PG&E [4], [15]. The price has
three different values in each day, which is 0.232 $/kWh during
the peak hours 12-18, 0.103 $/kWh during the mid-peak hours
8-12 and 18-20, and 0.056 $/kWh during the remaining off-
peak hours. The price of selling electricity to the energy market
is assumed to be 60% of the purchase price. The purchase and
sale power are both upper bounded by 1 MW.

Load demands: The demand trace is the hourly electricity
consumption data of a college in California for a typical
summer week [16]. Its maximum power is scaled to be 3
MW, as shown in Fig. 1. The inelastic demands are randomly
generated within 70%-90% of the total demands, and the rest
are treated as the elastic demands. The demands are assumed
to be forecasted with zero-mean errors which follow uniform
distributions. The maximum forecast error is proportional to
the absolute change in the corresponding demand of the time
slot w.r.t. that of the previous time slot, and the proportion
coefﬁcient is equal to 5% and 10% for the inelastic and elastic
demands, respectively. The error is capped within 80% of the
minimum and 120% of the maximum demand.

Service requirements: The long-term average percentage
of unsatisﬁed elastic demand is set to be no more than 30%,
while the maximum percentage is set to 40%. When there is a
supply shortage (or surplus), the shortage (or surplus) cost at
a price of 0.06 (or 0.07) $/kWh is imposed to the microgrid
as a penalty. In addition, the total amount of carbon emission
is kept below 1,337.6 kg/h (which is the amount generated
by the three CGs working at 95% of their maximum output
powers), and the operating reserve is maintained no less than
5% of the aggregate maximum output power of the three CGs.

B. Case Studies

1) Value of the second-stage optimization: The real-time
economic dispatch performed in the second stage aims to
optimize the amount of energy generated, stored and traded
based on the hour-ahead forecast data, which respects the UC
solution obtained in the ﬁrst stage. The added value comes
from the more accurate data available. This is veriﬁed by
the simulation results shown in Fig. 1 (the parameters αavg
and αmax are set to 0.3 to enable a fair comparison). The
second-stage optimization contributes to a lower operating cost
compared to that when only the ﬁrst-stage optimization is
applied. And the cost ($13,764) is close to the ideal benchmark
cost ($13,537) obtained by optimizing the one-week schedule
as a whole using the error-free forecast data.

only the ﬁrst stage of the proposed optimization is applied; (b) both
stages of the proposed optimization are applied; and (c) the hourly
operating costs and hourly demand forecasting errors.

2) Value of having a good model: The start-up/shut-down
and charging/discharging costs are often inappropriately mod-
eled to enable simpler models in the literature, e.g., [6], [7]. It
is of interest to examine the consequences. As shown in Fig. 2,
when the start-up/shut-down cost is not incorporated into the
optimization model, the schedule leads to frequent shut-downs
and start-ups of the CGs. This increases the actual operating
cost to $15,964, which is higher than its counterpart ($13,843)
when both types of costs are incorporated. The consequence is
more serious when the charging and discharging costs are not
included in the optimization, which leads to frequent charges
and discharges of the ESSs and consequently a higher operat-
ing cost of $25,468. The results demonstrate the importance
of having appropriate cost models for both CGs and ESSs,
which can considerably reduce the total operating cost.

3) Sensitivity to forecast errors: As both day-ahead and
hour-ahead forecast errors of the demands and renewable
generation are increased by multiplying a common factor ρ,
the impacts to the generation schedule are reﬂected in the
increase of the total operating cost. As shown in Fig. 3(a),
the cost increment by applying the two-stage optimization
approach is small for ρ increasing from 0.5 to 2. In contrast,
the cost increase is signiﬁcantly much larger if only the ﬁrst-
stage optimization is applied. This indicates that the two-stage
approach is robust against forecast errors, mostly owing to the
second-stage optimization with a shorter forecast lead time.
The curves in Fig. 3(b) depict the evolutions of the cumulative
differences of the total operating costs for ρ = 1, 1.5 and
2 relative to that for ρ = 0.5, which verify again that the
operating cost increases with the forecast errors.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

This work presented a two-stage optimization approach to
schedule the energy generation in a microgrid based on a
realistic model. The approach integrates a day-ahead UC and
an hour-ahead economic dispatch as a way to handle large
uncertainties in the demand and the renewable generation.
The combined solution approximately optimizes the long-term
average operating cost of the microgrid subject to operational
constraints and both short-term and long-term service require-
ments. The simulations conducted with real trace data verify
the efﬁcacy of the proposed approach, and demonstrate the
importance and value of adopting realistic models for the
components, especially the ESSs, in a microgrid.

Our future work includes conducting performance analysis
of the proposed scheduling approach and extending the case
studies to other aspects of the microgrid, such as the impacts
of the service requirements and design parameters on the
generation scheduling and economic performance.
