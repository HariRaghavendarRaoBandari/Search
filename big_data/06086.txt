Abstract
The recent interest in a light gauge boson in the framework of an extra U(1) symmetry motivates searches in the mass range below
1 GeV. We present a search for such a particle, the dark photon, in e+e− → Uγ, U → π+π− based on 28 million e+e− → π+π−γ
events collected at DAΦNE by the KLOE experiment. The π+ π− production by initial-state radiation compensates for a loss of
sensitivity of previous KLOE U → e+ e− , µ+ µ− searches due to the small branching ratios in the ρ − ω resonance region. We
found no evidence for a signal and set a limit at 90% CL on the mixing strength between the photon and the dark photon, ε2, in the
U mass range between 527 and 987 MeV. Above 700 MeV this new limit is more stringent than previous ones.

Keywords: dark matter, dark forces, dark photon, U boson

1. Introduction

A new kind of matter, called dark matter (DM), which does
not absorb or emit light, has been postulated since the early
’30s of the past century [1] and its existence is now widely ac-
cepted [2]. However, its interpretation is still among the great-
est and fascinating enigmas of Physics. The current paradigm

assumes that the DM is a thermal relic from the Big Bang, ac-
counting for about 24% of the total energy density of the Uni-
verse [2] and producing eﬀects only through its gravitational
interactions with large-scale cosmic structures. To include the
DM in a particle theoretical framework, the Standard Model
(SM) is usually complemented with many extensions [3–7] that
attribute to the DM candidates also strong self interactions and
weak-scale interactions with SM particles. Among the possi-
ble candidates, a Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP)
aroused much interest since a particle with weak-scale annihi-

lation cross section can account for the DM relic abundance
estimated through the study of the cosmic microwave back-
ground [2]. The force carrier in WIMP annihilations could be
a new gauge vector boson, known as U boson, dark photon, γ(cid:48)
or A(cid:48), with allowed decays into leptons and hadrons. Its assidu-
ous worldwide search has been strongly motivated by the astro-
physical evidence recently observed in many experiments [8–
14] and by its possible positive one-loop contribution to the
theoretical value of the muon magnetic moment anomaly [15],
which could solve, partly or entirely, the well known 3.6 σ dis-
crepancy with the experimental measurement [16].

(cid:48)

In this paper we assume the simplest theoretical hypothesis
according to which the dark sector consists of just one extra
abelian gauge symmetry, U(1), with one gauge boson, the U bo-
son, whose decays into invisible light dark matter are kinemati-
cally inaccessible. In this framework the dark photon would act
like a virtual photon, with virtuality q2 = m2
U. It would couple
to leptons and quarks with the same strength and would appear
(its width being much smaller than the experimental mass res-
olution) as a narrow resonance in any process involving real or
virtual photons. The coupling to the SM photon would occur
by means of a vector portal mechanism [3], i.e. loops of heavy
dark particles charged under both the SM and the dark force.
The strength of the mixing with the photon is parametrized by
a single factor ε2 = α
/α which is the ratio of the eﬀective dark
and SM photon couplings [3]. The size of the ε2 parameter is
expected to be very small (10−2 − 10−8) causing a suppression
of the U boson production rate. The U boson decays into SM
particles would happen through the same mixing operator, with
the corresponding decay amplitude suppressed by an ε2 factor,
but are still expected to be detectable at high luminosity e+e−
colliders [17–19].
KLOE has already searched for radiative U boson produc-
tion in the e+e− → Uγ , U → e+e−, µ+µ− processes [20, 21].
The leptonic channels are aﬀected by a decrease in sensitivity
in the ρ− ω region due to the dominant branching fraction into
hadrons. For a virtual photon with q2 < 1 GeV2, the coupling
to the charged pion is given by the product of the electric charge
and the pion form factor, e Fπ(q2). The eﬀective coupling of the
U boson to pions is thus predicted to be given by the product
of the virtual photon coupling and the kinetic mixing param-
eter ε e Fπ(q2) [19]. Being far from the π+π− mass threshold
(see Section 3) ﬁnite mass eﬀects can be safely neglected. We
thus searched for a short lived U boson decaying to π+π− in
a data sample corresponding to 1.93 fb−1 integrated luminos-
ity, by looking for a resonant peak in the dipion invariant mass
spectrum with initial-state radiation (ISR) π+π−γ events.

2. The KLOE detector

The KLOE detector operates at DAΦNE , the Frascati φ-
factory. DAΦNE is an e+e− collider usually operated at a cen-
ter of mass energy mφ (cid:39) 1.019 GeV. Positron and electron
beams collide at an angle of π−25 mrad, producing φ mesons
nearly at rest. The KLOE detector consists of a large cylindrical
drift chamber (DC) [22], surrounded by a lead scintillating-ﬁber
electromagnetic calorimeter (EMC) [23]. A superconducting

2

coil around the EMC provides a 0.52 T magnetic ﬁeld along
the bisector of the colliding beams. The bisector is taken as the
z axis of our coordinate system. The x axis is horizontal, point-
ing to the center of the collider rings and the y axis is vertical,
directed upwards.

The EMC barrel and end-caps cover 98% of the solid
angle. Calorimeter modules are read out at both ends by
4880 photomultipliers.
Energy and time resolutions are
E(GeV) ⊕ 100 ps,

respectively. The drift chamber has only stereo wires and is 4 m
in diameter, 3.3 m long. It is built out of carbon-ﬁbers and op-
erates with a low-Z gas mixture (helium with 10% isobutane).
Spatial resolutions are σxy ∼ 150 µm and σz ∼ 2 mm. The mo-
mentum resolution for large angle tracks is σ(p⊥)/p⊥ ∼ 0.4%.
The trigger uses both EMC and DC information. Events used in
this analysis are triggered by at least two energy deposits larger
than 50 MeV in two sectors of the barrel calorimeter [24].

3. Event selection

We selected π+π−γ candidates by requesting events with
two oppositely-charged tracks emitted at large polar angles,
50◦ < θ < 130◦, with the undetected ISR photon miss-
ing momentum pointing – according to the π+π−γ kinematics
– at a small polar angles (θ < 15◦, θ > 165◦). The tracks
were required to have the point of closest approach to the z axis
within a cylinder of radius 8 cm and length 15 cm centred at
the interaction point.
In order to ensure good reconstruction
and eﬃciency, we selected tracks with transverse and longitu-
dinal momentum in the range p⊥ > 160 MeV or p(cid:107) > 90 MeV,
respectively.
Since the π+π−γ cross section behaviour as a function of
the ISR photon polar angle is divergent (∝ 1/θ4
γ), the track
and the photon acceptance selections make the ﬁnal-state ra-
diation (FSR) and the φ resonant processes relatively unimpor-
tant, leaving us with a high purity ISR sample and increasing
our sensitivity to the U → π+π− decay [25].

The Monte Carlo simulation of the Mππ spectrum was pro-
duced with the PHOKHARA event generator [26] with the K¨uhn–
Santamaria (KS) [27] pion form factor parametrization and in-
cluded a full description of the KLOE detector (GEANFI pack-
age [28]). The collected data were simulated including φ de-
cays and leptonic processes e+e− → (cid:96)+(cid:96)−γ(γ), (cid:96) = e, µ. The
main background contributions aﬀecting the ISR π+π−γ sam-
ple are the resonant e+e− → φ → π+π−π0 process and the ISR
and FSR e+e− → (cid:96)+(cid:96)−γ(γ), (cid:96) = e, µ processes (they will be de-
ﬁned as “residual background” in the following). We reduced
their contribution by applying kinematic cuts in the Mtrk − M2
plane, as explained in Refs. [29, 30]. M2
ππ is the squared invari-
ant mass of the two selected tracks in the pion mass hypothesis
while Mtrk is the mass of the charged particles associated to the
tracks, computed in the equal mass hypothesis and assuming
that the missing momentum of the event pertains to a single
photon. Distributions of the Mtrk variable for data and simu-
lation are shown in Fig. 1, where the Mtrk > 130 MeV cut to
discriminate muons from pions is also indicated.

and φ → π+π−π0. Figure 2 shows the fractional components of
the residual background, FBG, individually for each contribut-
ing channel and their sum. The residual background rises up
to about 6% at low invariant masses and to 5% above 0.9 GeV,
decreasing to less than 1% in the resonance region.

formed with the Gounaris-Sakurai |Fπ|2 parametrization (red open squares) for
the Mππ invariant mass spectrum. The ﬁgure insert shows in detail the agree-
ment achieved in the ρ − ω mixing region (779–791 MeV).

A very good description of the ρ− ω interference region (see
the insert of Fig. 3) was achieved by producing a dedicated
sample using PHOKHARA as event generator with the Gounaris-
Sakhurai (GS) pion form factor parametrization [32]. The gen-
eration process used properly smeared distributions in order to
account for the dipion invariant mass resolution (1.4–1.8 MeV).
In Fig. 3 the measured data spectrum is compared with the
results of this simulation process, which includes the residual
background.

4. Irreducible background parametrization and estimate
Except for the ρ − ω region, we estimated the irreducible
background directly from data. For each U mass hypothesis the
data are ﬁtted in a Mππ interval centred at MU and 18-20 times
wider than the Mππ resolution σMππ. The background is mod-
elled by a monotonic function using Chebyshev polinomials up
to the sixth order and is estimated using the sideband technique,
by excluding from the ﬁt the data in the region ±3 σMππ around
MU [20]. The procedure is repeated in steps of 2 MeV in MU.
Fits with the best reduced χ2 are selected as histograms rep-
resenting the background. For all used mass intervals, the dis-
tributions were found to be smooth, with no “wiggles” in any
mass sub-range. An example of the ﬁt procedure is reported in
Fig. 4. Figure 5 shows the distribution of the diﬀerences (pulls)
between data and the ﬁtted background normalized to the data
statistical error. Also shown is a Gaussian ﬁt of this distribu-
tion. The mean and width parameters of the Gaussian ﬁt are
around zero and one, respectively.

Measured data are represented in black, simulated π+π−γ and µ+µ−γ in red.

rejected.

A particle ID estimator (PID), L±, deﬁned for each track with
associated energy released in EMC and based on a pseudo-
likelihood function, uses calorimeter information (size and
shape of the energy depositions and time of ﬂight) to suppress
radiative Bhabha scattering events [29–31].

Figure 2: Fractional backgrounds, normalized to the π+π−γ contribution, from
the π+π−π0, e+e−γ, and µ+µ−γ channels after all selection criteria.

Electrons deposit their energy mainly at the entrance of the
calorimeter while muons and pions tend to have a deeper pen-
etration in the EMC. Events with both tracks having L± < 0
are identiﬁed as e+e−γ events and rejected. The eﬃciency of
this selection is larger than 99.95% as evaluated using measured
data and simulated π+π−γ samples.
After these selections, about 2.8 × 107 events are left in the
measured data sample. We then applied the same analysis chain
to the Monte Carlo simulated data: most of the selected sam-
ple consists of π+π−γ events, with residual ISR (cid:96)+(cid:96)−γ, (cid:96) = e, µ

ground with the PHOKHARA generator and to the smearing
procedure in the 779-791 MeV mass range.

Figure 6:
Fractional systematic error on the estimated background. Blue
points: errors from the sideband ﬁt procedure; black points: errors estimated
from the PHOKHARA Monte Carlo simulation for the ρ − ω interference region.

The evaluation of the systematic uncertainties on the ﬁtted
background was performed by adding in quadrature, bin by bin,
the contributions due to the errors of the ﬁt and a systematic er-
ror due to the ﬁt procedure. The ﬁrst is obtained by propagating,
for each ﬁt interval, the corresponding errors of the ﬁt parame-
ters. The second is evaluated by varying the ﬁt parameters by
±1σ and computing the maximum diﬀerence between the stan-
dard ﬁt and the ﬁt derived by using the modiﬁed parameters.
The systematic error is less than 1% in most of the mass range.
In the ρ − ω region the systematic error is computed by
adding in quadrature the contributions due to the theoretical
uncertainty of the Monte Carlo generator (0.5% [26]), the sys-
tematic error due to the residual background evaluation (0.3 %,
computed by changing the analysis cuts within the correspond-
ing experimental resolutions), the contribution of the smear-
ing procedure (0.8%, obtained by varying the applied smear-
ing of ±1 σ), and the systematic uncertainty on the luminosity
(0.3 % [26]). The resulting total systematic error is about 1%.
The total systematic uncertainty due to the background eval-
uation is shown in Figure 6. The full list of the systematic ef-
fects taken into account is summarized in Table 1. They do
not aﬀect the irreducible background estimate performed with
the sideband ﬁtting technique, but partially contribute to the
background estimate in the ρ − ω region (see above) and en-
ter in the determination of the selection eﬃciency and the lu-
minosity measurement. Finally, in Fig. 7 we show the global
analysis eﬃciency as estimated with the full π+π−γ simulation
(PHOKHARA generator + GEANFI [28]). This includes contri-
butions from kinematic cuts, trigger, tracking, acceptance and
PID-likelihood eﬀects. The total systematic error on the global
analysis eﬃciency ranges between 0.7% and 0.4% as Mππ in-
creases.

Figure 5: Distribution of the diﬀerences (pulls) data-background normalized to

The region of ρ−ω interference is not smooth (see Fig. 3) and
then not easy to be ﬁtted with the sideband technique. We thus
estimated the background in this region by using the PHOKHARA
generator with smeared distributions, as explained in Section 3
and shown in Fig. 3 for the 779–791 MeV mass range.

5. Systematic errors and eﬃciencies

The main systematic uncertainties aﬀecting this analysis are
related to the evaluation of the irreducible background. As two
diﬀerent procedures were used in diﬀerent mass ranges, the es-
timate of the systematic error accounted for two independent

6. Upper limits

We did not observe any excess of events with respect to the
estimated background with signiﬁcance larger than three stan-
dard deviations over the whole MU explored spectrum. We thus
extracted the mass dependent limits on ε2 at 90% conﬁdence
level (CL) by means of the CLS technique [33]. The procedure
requires as inputs the measured invariant mass spectrum, the es-
timated irreducible total background and the U boson signal for
each Mππ bin. The measured spectrum is used as input without
any eﬃciency or background correction. The signal is gener-
ated varying the U boson mass hypothesis in steps of 2 MeV.
At each step, a Gaussian peak is built with a width correspond-
ing to the invariant mass resolution of the dipion system. The
systematic uncertainties were taken into account by performing
a Gaussian smearing of the evaluated background according to
the estimates in Section 5 and Fig. 6. The results of the statis-
tical procedure are shown in Figure 8 in terms of the number
NCLS of U boson signal events excluded at 90% CL.

We computed the limit on the mixing strength ε2 by means

of the following formula [20, 21]:

ε2 =

α(cid:48)

NCLS/(eﬀ · L)

where eﬀ is the global analysis eﬃciency (see Fig. 7), L is

is the eﬀective e+e− → U → π+π− cross section integrated
over the single mass bin centered at Mππ = MU with ε = 1.
The uncertainties on H, eﬀ, L, and I, propagate to the system-
atic error on ε2 via eq. (1). The resulting uncertainty on ε2 is
lower than 1% and has been taken into account in the estimated
limit. Figure 9 shows the results from eq. 1 after a smoothing

7. Conclusions

We used an integrated luminosity of 1.93 fb−1 of KLOE
data to search for dark photon hadronic decays in the e+e− →
Uγ, U → π+π− continuum process. No signal has been ob-
served and a limit at 90% CL has been set on the coupling factor
ε2 in the energy range between 527 and 987 MeV. The limit is
more stringent than other limits in the ρ − ω region and above.
