Abstract. Rare earth ions have exceptionally long coherence times, making them an
excellent candidate for quantum information processing. A key part of this processing
is quantum state transfer. We demonstrate that high ﬁdelity quantum state transfer
between two ensembles of rare earth ions can be achieved by time reversing the
connecting optical quantum channel, and suggest using a gradient echo memory to
perform this time reversal. We demonstrate that the superradiant coupling between
the ensemble of ions and an intermediate cavity coupled to the optical channel can lead
to higher transfer ﬁdelities than would otherwise be possible with an individual ion.
We suggest increasing the size of the ensemble can overcome unwanted loss processes
that reduce the transfer ﬁdelity.

Superradiance-enhanced quantum state transfer with time reversal

1. Introduction

High ﬁdelity quantum state transfer will play an important role in quantum information
processing [1, 2]. State transfer using a quantum optical channel, in particular, allows
high speed transfer over long distances with little loss [3, 4]. The challenge is to
determine a method to coherently transfer the quantum state of an ‘emitter’ system
to a ‘receiver’ system. It has been recognized that perfect state transfer can be achieved
when the equation of motion of a single qubit is a time-reversed version of the receiver
[5]. This principle underpinned the earliest proposal for transferring the state between
two qubits with an optical channel, where the coupling between the systems and the
channel was engineered such that the carrier photon had a time symmetric wavepacket
[5]. However, the time symmetric approach does not scale when transferring the
state between ensembles of qubits, as the number of constraining equations increases
exponentially with the number of photons in the optical channel facilitating the transfer.
Instead, we propose time reversing the quantum optical channel using a Gradient Echo
Memory (GEM) [6, 7, 8, 9] to achieve perfect transfer between two ensembles of qubits.
Furthermore, we argue that ensembles of qubits can achieve higher transfer ﬁdelities
than individual qubits when superradiant coupling between the qubits and the quantum
channel is possible.

typical experiments involve ensembles of

We propose an implementation of our protocol with rare-earth ion crystals. Rare-
earth ion crystals have exceptionally long coherence times: among hyperﬁne transitions,
T2 coherence times can be as long as hours [10]. Furthermore, work with stoichiometric
crystals has shown that it is possible to get very strong interactions between nearby
ions [11], making rare earth ions ideal for quantum information processing. Previous
quantum state transfer proposals with rare earth ions have targeted individual ions [12].
However, addressing individual rare earth ions is challenging, with few demonstrations
[13, 14];
ions [10], and most quantum
information processing proposals have targeted ensembles [15, 16, 17, 18]. Here we
show that working with ensembles rather then individual sites presents an advantage,
as the collective phenomenon of superradiance can be used improve the eﬃciency of
coupling into the GEM. This has previously been exploited in experiments to enter the
cavity QED regime with an ensemble of rare earth ions and an optical resonator [19].
The key to achieving strong coupling between a cavity and an ensemble is having a small
inhomogeneous linewidth that matches the linewidth of the cavity [20]; inhomogeneous
linewidths smaller than the hyperﬁne level spacing have recently been achieved in
stoichiometric crystals [21].

Previous work that considered state transfer between ensembles through optical
channels focused on transferring a perturbative, single excitation [22, 23]. We consider
a diﬀerent state transfer problem that is non-perturbative; our aim is to take an ensemble
of separable, identical (up to a rotation in phase) qubits in an arbitrary quantum state
and transfer this state onto another ensemble.
The manuscript is structured as follows:

in section 2, we demonstrate that the

Superradiance-enhanced quantum state transfer with time reversal

principle of time reversal can be used to transfer the state between two identical quantum
systems, up to a sign change in the Hamiltonian, as long as they have unique dark states.
In section 3, we demonstrate that a GEM can be used to physically realize time reversal
of a coherent pulse in an optical quantum channel. In section 4, we present a proposal for
quantum state transfer between two ensembles of rare earth ions, examine the possible
advantages of superradiant coupling, and discuss what aﬀects the ﬁdelity of the transfer.
Finally, in section 5 we discuss implementation considerations for our transfer scheme
and its impact in the context of quantum control.

2. Generic quantum state transfer through time reversal

Here we demonstrate that the time-reversal of a quantum channel can be used to perform
perfect state transfer between two quantum systems with a unique dark steady state and
identical Hamiltonians, up to a sign change. We consider two systems: an ‘emitter’ and
a ‘receiver’. The emitter has a Hamiltonian Hem = H and coupling operator Lem = L.
We assume the emitter has a dark pure state, meaning L|ψss(cid:105) = 0 and H|ψss(cid:105) = h|ψss(cid:105),
which is the unique steady state of the system [24]. We can write down the Langevin
equation for an arbitrary Hermitian operator of the emitter system:

˙Xem(t) = − iXemHem − [Xem, L†

em](Lem/2 + bem,in(t)) + a.t.

(1)

where a.t. refers to adjoint transpose of all terms to the left. The output of this system
will be bem,out(t) = Lem(t) + bem,in(t). We set the initial state of the system and bath
to be |Ψem(t = 0)(cid:105) = |0(cid:105) ⊗ |ψ0(cid:105) ⊗ |0(cid:105) where we partition the bath at a time t into
an input before the system and an output after the system, and both are initially in
a vacuum state |0(cid:105). The system has a unique dark state, so we can be certain it will
asymptotically approach a separable state |Ψem(t = T )(cid:105) = |0(cid:105) ⊗ |ψss(cid:105) ⊗ |φ(cid:105), where |φ(cid:105)
is some multi-photon output state, for any pure state initial condition. We assume that
the system gets very close to this steady state in a time T . We can approximate that
bem,out(t) ≈ bem,in(t) for t ≥ T , meaning the output will no longer be correlated with the
system. Thus, we can trace out the emitter system without losing purity of the output
state. Next we consider some receiver system which obeys its own Langevin equation,
but we use a diﬀerent time index τ :

˙Xre(τ ) = − iXreHre − [Xre, L†

re](Lre/2 + bre,in(τ )) + a.t..

(2)

Our aim is to engineer this system such that its evolution is a time reversal of
the emitter. Speciﬁcally, we want the expectation of the error operator E(X, τ ) =
Xre(τ ) − Xem(t = T − τ ), for an arbitrary X, to be zero for 0 ≤ τ ≤ T . We ﬁrst
set the input of the system to be a sign-changed time reversal of the emitter output:
bre,in(τ ) = −bem,out(t = T − τ ) = −Lem(t = T − τ ) − bem,in(t = T − τ ). We can write
down the equation of motion of E(X, τ ) as follows:

˙E(X, τ ) = − iXre(τ )Hre(τ ) − iXem(t = T − τ )Hem(t = T − τ )

− [Xre(τ ), Lre(τ )](Lre(τ ) − Lem(t = T − τ ))/2

+ ([Xre(τ ), Lre(τ )] − [Xre(t = T − τ ), Lre(t = T − τ )])
× (Lem(t = T − τ )/2 + bem,in(t = T − τ )) + a.t..

(3)

In order to ensure E(X, τ = 0) = 0 we set the initial condition for the receiver to be the
ﬁnal state of the emitter, in terms of the whole state: |Ψre(τ = 0)(cid:105) = |φ(cid:48)(cid:105) ⊗ |ψss(cid:105) ⊗ |0(cid:105)
where |φ(cid:48)(cid:105) is the time reversed quantum channel and |ψss(cid:105) is the steady state of both
the emitter and receiver. Note this initial state was only possible to prepare because the
emitter had a unique dark state. Next to ensure ˙E(X, τ = 0) = 0 we set Hre = −H and
Lre = L. It can then be shown the solution E(X, τ ) = 0 for 0 ≤ τ ≤ T satisﬁes (3), as
this implies Xre(τ ) = Xem(t = T −τ ). The receiver will evolve in a time reversed manner
with respect to the emitter, such that ﬁnal state of the receiver will be the initial state
of the emitter: |Ψre(T )(cid:105) = |0(cid:105) ⊗ |ψ0(cid:105) ⊗ |0(cid:105). Hence we can perform perfect state transfer
between two identical quantum systems, up to a sign change in the Hamiltonian, with
unique dark states by simply time reversing the output of the bath and setting the initial
condition of the receiver to be the ﬁnal condition of the emitter.

3. Time reversal of a quantum channel using a GEM

The next challenge is to determine a physical system that will time reverse a quantum
channel. We will use a GEM to achieve this goal. A GEM is described by the following
Hamiltonian and coupling operator [9]:

HGEM = s(t)

Here Ξ is the bandwidth of the memory, ζ is the optical depth and s(t) is the sign of
the gradient which can be changed between ±1.

We can write down the following Heisenberg equations of motion for the atomic
excitation operator a(ξ, t) in terms of the input operator bGEM,in(t) and the equation for
the output operator bGEM,out(t):

The GEM is operated in two stages. First, a write stage between t = 0 to T , where
s(t) = +1. Here the atomic ﬁeld, initially in a vacuum, stores a light pulse injected into
the memory through bin(t). This is followed by the read stage between t = T to 2T ,
where s(t) = −1. Here what was stored in the atomic ﬁeld is read out through bout.

where χ(ζ) =
Strictly speaking (7) and (8) describe the wavepackets of the state, rather than the
operators, which we consider a and b to mean from this point on (see [9] for details).
We can see that what is stored in the memory is almost the Fourier transform of the
input pulse, up to a time dependent phase distortion which is independent of the input
pulse. If we pass the output of the GEM through a time dependent phase plate, i.e.
b(cid:48)
GEM,out(T + t) = SP P (T + t)bGEM,out(T + t) where SP P (T + t) = 1 for t < 0 and
eiζ ln(t(T−t)Ξ2)−2i arg(χ(ζ)) for t ≥ 0, then the ﬁnal output of the memory can be related to
the input as:

GEM,out(T + t) = (1 − e−2πζ)bGEM,in(T − t).
b(cid:48)

(9)

Hence the output of the GEM is a time reversed, attenuated version of the input. The
attenuation can be made arbitrarily small by increasing the optical depth ζ. This makes
the GEM the ideal candidate to reverse a quantum channel.

4. State transfer between two ensembles of rare earth ions

We propose an implementation of the generic state transfer using rare earth ion crystals
as shown in ﬁgure 1. An emitter crystal is coupled to an optical quantum channel
through a mediating ring cavity. The output of the emitter is fed into a GEM and
stored. The gradient of the GEM is ﬂipped and the stored light is sent to the receiver
crystal. The GEM acts as a perfect impedance matcher for the receiver ensemble by
time reversing the light it received from the emitter ensemble.

We assume that two spectrally identical ensembles of ions in the emitter and receiver
crystals have been prepared in the same hyperﬁne state, which we label |g(cid:105), using
hole-burning techniques. We assume the inhomogeneous linewidth of the ensemble is
very small and we neglect it for the ﬁrst part of our analysis. This assumption is not
necessary, which we show at the end of this section; however, we make it to ensure
we can compare the dynamics of a single ion vs an ensemble on equal footing (the
inhomogeneous linewidth is inherently the property of an ensemble). We assume an
electric ﬁeld can be applied to bring an optical transition between the ground state
|g(cid:105) and some excited state |e(cid:105) into resonance with the cavity and driving laser. We
also employ so-called cycling transitions [25] by applying appropriate magnetic ﬁelds
to minimize spontaneous emission events into other unwanted hyperﬁne levels. For
example, Pr3+:Y2SiO5 could be used, where the 3H4 level is used for |g(cid:105) and 1D2 is used
for |e(cid:105) [25].

Figure 1. An ensemble of rare earth ions termed the ‘emitter’ is coupled, with strength
g, to a ring cavity, which in turn is coupled, with strength κ, to a to quantum channel.
The quantum channel is passed through a GEM, with a controllable gradient s(t)
and optical depth ζ, and phase correction plate SPP(t). The resultant time reversed
signal from the emitter is sent to an identical ’receiver’ crystal, up to a sign change in
the Hamiltonian, where it is perfectly absorbed thus transferring the state. Both the
emitter and receiver have a spontaneous emission loss rate of γ. The laser and detector
are used for initial state preparation and measurement of the transfer performance.

The emitter and receiver ions are described by the following Hamiltonian and

coupling operator to the quantum channel:

(10)

(11)

Here the cavity has been brought into resonance with the optical transition between
|e(cid:105) → |g(cid:105) and we have moved into a rotating frame. The ensemble label l represents the
emitter l = em or receiver l = re, g is the coupling strength between an individual ion
and the cavity, cl is the cavity annihilation operator, κ is the coupling rate between the
cavity and the quantum channel, and sl is the sign of the Hamiltonian: through phase
matching the cavity to the ensemble we set sem = 1 and sre = −1. Jl is the collective
coupling operator between the ions and the cavity. We assume the cavity mode is a
plane wave with wave vector k0, such that the coupling operator is

Jl =

e−ixl,j·k0σl,j.

Where: σl,j = |g(cid:105)(cid:104)e|l,j; Nl is the number of ions in the emitter and receiver. Except
in the last ﬁgure, we set the number of ions to be the same and simply refer to the
number of both as N = Nem = Nre; xl,j is the position of the jth ion in the emitter
or receiver. The position of the ions will be ﬁxed, so we can make a transformation of
j=1 σl,j. Even if the positions of the ions are
diﬀerent in the emitter and receiver, after making the transformation, the Hamiltonians
will now be identical up to a sign change. We assume each individual ion also undergoes
spontaneous emission loss at a rate γ, i.e. Lloss

The emitter and receiver ensembles satisfy our requirements for perfect state
transfer. They have identical coupling operators and their Hamiltonians are of opposite
sign Hem = −Hre. We are interested in transferring the state of an ensemble of

Latexit font size 20ptSuperradiance-enhanced quantum state transfer with time reversal

identical ions. Thus the initial condition of the emitter ions and cavity is of the form
j=1 (sin(θ0/2)|g(cid:105) + cos(θ0/2)eiφ0|e(cid:105))em,j where |0(cid:105) is the vacuum state for
|ψθ0,φ0(cid:105) = |0(cid:105) ⊗N
the cavity. States of this kind can be prepared using optical laser pulses [16]. Assuming
we start in a state of this kind, the ensemble will evolve into a unique dark steady state:
|ψss(cid:105) = |0(cid:105) ⊗N

j=1 |g(cid:105)l,j, which is common to the emitter and receiver.

The total Hamiltonian Htotal and coupling operator Ltotal for the proposed scheme

where L(cid:48)
The timing of the transfer proceeds as follows: at t = 0 the emitter crystal is
prepared in some state |ψem(0)(cid:105) = |ψθ0,φ0(cid:105). The output of the emitter is written on
to the GEM over a time period T , which is suﬃcient time for the emitter to enter the
dark state |ψem(T )(cid:105) ≈ |ψss(cid:105). The gradient of the GEM is ﬂipped at time T and the
output is passed through the phase plate to the receiver ensemble. The receiver has
|ψre(T )(cid:105) = |ψss(cid:105). The time ﬂipped output of the
been initialized in the dark state:
emitter is then absorbed by the receiver. In the ideal case, we expect the ﬁnal state of
the receiver to be the initial state of the emitter |ψre(2T )(cid:105) ≈ |ψθ0,φ0(cid:105).

In what follows we perform a set of numerical simulations to verify the performance
of the GEM in ideal conditions and investigate how loss aﬀects the transfer performance.

4.1. Coupling to the quantum channel

Before we consider the entire transfer process, we highlight the advantage of using an
ensemble rather than individual rare earth ions when coupling to a quantum channel.
Our ﬁrst challenge is to engineer the emitter such that the majority of excitation
is transferred into the quantum channel instead of other loss mechanisms. We have
assumed that each individual ion undergoes spontaneous emission, with rate γ, which
is not captured by our quantum channel. We thus want to couple the light from the
cavity into the quantum channel as fast as possible. By linearizing the ensemble it can
N , which we use
be shown that the critical dampening rate for the cavity is κ = 2g
for the remainder of the paper.

√

Next we look at the parameters of the ions. There are N ions which are
collectively coupled to the cavity with a strength g. This results in a superradiant
enhancement of the eﬀective coupling strength to the quantum channel. We do not
use this approximation in our simulations, but for the purpose of analysis, we can
adiabatically eliminate the cavity, which gives an eﬀective coupling operator L(cid:48)
√
em =
2gJem/
In this limit, we can
see that the coupling between the ions and the channel is collective. This results
in N 2 scaling of the spontaneous emission rate into the quantum channel, namely,
Pcol = (cid:104)ψθ0,φ0|L(cid:48)†

κ between the ensemble and the quantum channel.

We are interested in the relative rate of spontaneous emission into the quantum
channel compared to other modes, speciﬁcally R = Pcol/Ploss = 4N g2/γκ = 2
N g/γ,
where we have replaced κ with its critical dampening value.

Our aim is to make R as large as possible, to maximize the light spontaneously
emitted into the quantum channel compared to other loss channels. Increasing g/γ is
possible by using cavities with small mode volumes [12], but achieving this in practice
with rare earth ions has been challenging [28]. In contrast, achieving extremely large
N in rare earth ions is straightforward. A large R is the key advantage ensembles have
over individual rare earth ions.

We demonstrate the advantage of

light emitted into the quantum channel Iout =(cid:82) T

large N for the coupling eﬃciency η =
Iout/N cos2(θ0/2) numerically in ﬁgure 2. The coupling eﬃciency is deﬁned as the total
out(t)bout(t)(cid:105) compared to the total
†
excitation in the initial ensemble of atoms N cos2(θ0/2). We perform the simulation with
a direct method for N = 1 to 7 and a mean ﬁeld method for larger particle numbers,
see Appendix A for details. Furthermore, we consider three initial states of θ0: π/4, π/2
and 3π/4. In all cases the quantum eﬃciency eventually improves with particle number,
although there is a small dip in the direct simulations after N = 1.

N and T = 20/κ.

√

In terms of the convergence between the mean ﬁeld method and direct method,
we see that the solutions asymptotically approach one another in the limit of large
N . However, the rate of convergence is slower for states close to θ0 = 0. The
convergence is so slow in the θ0 = π/4 case that we can not conﬁrm, quantitatively,
that the methods converge with the maximum number of particles we could simulate
with the direct method: N = 7. The reason for this slow convergence is that the mean-

text size 30Superradiance-enhanced quantum state transfer with time reversal

ﬁeld description of the coupling has a nonphysical, unstable ﬁxed point for an initial
condition of θ0 = 0 (see Appendix A). This means the mean-ﬁeld simulations tend to
signiﬁcantly underestimate the true eﬃciency for initial states close to the excited state.
Fortunately, as we can see in ﬁgure 2, the mean-ﬁeld is always strictly below the direct
solution. Hence it can be thought of as a lower bound for the eﬃciency that gets tighter
as the particle number N increases.

The superradiant coupling can also assist in selecting an individual optical
transition between the many possible hyperﬁne transitions.
The superradiant
enhancement only occurs on the transition which is resonant with the cavity. Oﬀ-
resonant transitions interfere with one another, making collective emission unlikely.

4.2. Complete quantum state transfer

We perform a numerical simulation of the quantum state transfer protocol in a system
with small loss, γ/g = 0.1, and a high quality GEM with optical depth ζ = 2.
Direct simulations of a GEM become rapidly computationally expensive as the number
of photons increases. Fortunately, as we have demonstrated in ﬁgure 2, mean-ﬁeld
simulations make reliable quantitative predictions for ensembles with N ≥ 7 and initial
states θ0 ≥ π/2, and give a good lower bound on ﬁdelity for initial states θ0 < π/2 that
tightens as N increases. Hence, we use two simulation methods: a direct method for
the N = 1 case, and a mean-ﬁeld method for N (cid:29) 1 (see Appendix B for details).

In ﬁgure 3 we plot the dynamical ﬂow of excitation from the emitter to the

l cl(cid:105), and the memory as Ea(ξ, t) = (cid:104)a(ξ)†a(ξ)(cid:105). In
†
the N = 1 case, we can see that the evolution of the emitter and receiver is close to
symmetric about T , and the receiver almost reaches the initial state of the emitter. The
ﬁnite amount of loss γ/a results in some loss of excitation and an imperfect transfer.
However, this loss can be overcome through superradiant coupling. This is shown in
the N = 106 case. Here we see that the evolution of the emitter and receiver is now
perfectly symmetric and the receiver ﬁnishes almost exactly in the initial state of the
emitter. Furthermore, comparing the ensemble to individual ion transfer, we can see
that the shape of the cavity output does depend on N , and the time it takes to perform
the transfer is much shorter in the N = 106 case compared to the N = 1 case.

4.3. Eﬀects of imperfections

To get a more detailed understanding of how imperfections aﬀect the system, we now
look at the transfer ﬁdelity as a function of initial state, number, loss and optical depth
in ﬁgure 4. We deﬁne the ﬁdelity F of the transfer with regard to the average state of
j=1 Trl,j[ρ]/N where
Trl,j is deﬁned as tracing over all systems except the jth ion of the emitter l = em or

the ion. Speciﬁcally, we deﬁne the average ion state to be ¯ρl =(cid:80)N
receiver l = re and the ﬁdelity is F = ||(cid:112)¯ρem(0)(cid:112)¯ρre(2T )|| where ||·|| is the trace norm.

(solid black line), and in b with N = 10 (dotted red line), N = 103 (dashed green
line) and N = 104 (solid blue line); in both plots γ/g = 0.1 and ζ = 2. Fidelity is
plotted against the optical depth ζ and loss γ in c and d with θ0 = π/2, N = 1 in c
and N = 106 in d. All simulations have φ0 = 0, κ = 2g

N , and T = 50/κ.

√

In ﬁgure 4 part a we consider how the initial state aﬀects the transfer process. For a
ﬁxed γ and ζ, we plot the ﬁdelity of state transfer as a function of the initial state. The
state transfer ﬁdelity only depends on the excited state population, and is independent of
φ0. The transfer ﬁdelity clearly depends on θ0 and is worst when the state is initialized in
|ψem(0)(cid:105) = |e(cid:105). This is because our protocol transfers the amplitude of the excited state,
but the receiver is already initialized in the ground state. Consequently, we will always
achieve a perfect transfer ﬁdelity when |ψem(0)(cid:105) = |g(cid:105), independent of any imperfections
in the system.

Furthermore, we see that the lower-bound provided by the mean ﬁeld prediction is
overly conservative when the states are close to θ0 = 0. As we increase the number of
particles N , the lower bound on ﬁdelity improves. However, the ﬁxed point at θ0 = 0
makes the mean-ﬁeld simulation technique uninformative for the θ0 = 0 case, and we
have to analyze the situation physically.

When θ0 = 0, there exists no relative phase relationship between the ions in the
ensemble as they are all in the excited state. In this case, the probability of the ﬁrst
emission into the cavity mode compared to other modes will be independent of the
particle number. Instead it will only be a function of the geometry, or more speciﬁcally,

abdcSuperradiance-enhanced quantum state transfer with time reversal

12

the mode volume of the ensemble. In this case the ensemble will not necessarily have an
advantage over an individual ion. But this is only true when θ0 = 0; when θ0 =  is small,
a phase relationship will develop between the ions, meaning emission into the cavity vs
other modes will start to scale with N . More speciﬁcally, we expect an ensemble to start
√
having a distinct advantage over an individual ion (for the same mode volume) when
N . Thus the volume of initial states where an ensemble has a clear advantage
 > 1/
over an individual ion also increases with particle number. Lastly, working with an
ensemble provides more ﬂexibility with geometry, which may provide an advantage over
an individual ion even in the case of θ0 = 0, but we leave this as an open question for
future work.

In ﬁgure 4 part b-d we consider the deleterious eﬀects of loss and lower optical
depths. We perform a scan over loss γ and optical depth ζ versus ﬁdelity, with a
ﬁxed g and initial state. We can see that the ﬁdelity monotonically decreases as the
loss increases, or when the optical depth gets smaller. In most applications there will
be some ﬁnite ﬁdelity for transfer required before error correction can be employed to
compensate. Fortunately, given some initial state and target ﬁdelity, we can overcome
a ﬁnite loss rate γ by simply using a larger N , as shown in ﬁgure 4. Similarly, the
performance of a GEM can be improved by using a larger optical depth ζ, which can
be achieved by increasing the rare earth ion density. In both cases, stoichiometric rare
earth ion crystals with narrow inhomogeneous linewidths could be used to achieve very
large N and ζ as required for highly eﬃcient state transfer.

ions in the receiver compared to emitter Nre/Nem with Nem = 106, θ0 = π/2, φ0 = 0,
ζ = 2, γ = 0, κ = 2g

Nem and T = 50/κ.

√

The last imperfection we simulate is an imbalance in number between the ions. We
can only simulate this case with the mean-ﬁeld method. In ﬁgure 5 we plot the ﬁdelity
of transfer as a function of the ratio between Nre/Nem. We can see the transfer ﬁdelity
is perfect when Nem = Nre, but reduces as the number of ions between the emitter
and receiver become unbalanced. Fortunately, this problem is solved by simply using a
larger ensemble. Assuming that the number of ions in the ensembles are randomly chosen
from a Poisson distribution with the same mean N , which is reasonable given they are

Superradiance-enhanced quantum state transfer with time reversal

13

√
typically prepared optically with lasers that also obey Poisson statistics, the standard
N . Given this distribution, the
deviation in the distribution of the ions will scale as
√
mean fraction will be Nre/Nem = 1, with the standard deviation in the fraction being
N . Consequently, using a larger ensemble results in a fraction close to one, and a
1/
higher ﬁdelity.

4.4. Finite inhomogeneous broadening

In practice, the Hamiltonians for the emitter and receiver ensemble will include an
additional term to account for the non-zero inhomogneous broadening of the ensemble:

N(cid:88)

Hl =

∆l,jσ+

z − islg(Jlc

l − J
†

†

(15)

density function l(∆), where(cid:82) ∞

j=1

Where, each ∆l,j is a random variable sampled from the inhomogeneous broadening
−∞ d∆l(∆) = N . We assume that the inhomogeneous
broadening distribution is the same for the emitter and receiver (∆) = em(∆) = re(∆)
and it is an even function such that (∆) = (−∆). In the limit of very large N according
to the law of large numbers Hem ≈ −Hre; furthermore, the dark state remains the same.
Consequently, even with the addition of a non-zero inhomogeneous broadening perfect
state transfer can still be achieved.

5. Discussion

We have described a method for transferring a quantum state from one quantum system
to another by way of a GEM and described its implementation using rare earth ions.
The implementation we presented includes an optical coupling link between crystals
to allow for transport over long distances. However, this is not vital, and initial
experimental demonstrations could even be made with a single crystal performing the
role of emitter, memory, and receiver by using controllable electrodes to create three
distinguishable regions along the direction of light. Likewise, the cavity is not the
only way to enhance the superradiant coupling along the light direction. Another
option is to change the geometry of the ensemble to make a long, skinny cylinder
[29]. This ensures superradiant ampliﬁcation mostly occurs along the cylinder axis.
With these modiﬁcations, implementing this protocol in a rare earth crystal is relatively
straightforward, particularly as GEMs have previously been demonstrated in rare earth
crystals [6]. The only additional component required in our implementation is the time
dependent phase shift at the output, which can be achieved using a time-dependent
applied electric ﬁeld to change the detuning of the rare-earth ions at the end of the
GEM.

The next most important experimental imperfection that was not explicitly included
was dephasing in the hyperﬁne states. However, all independent decoherence processes
scale as N , as opposed to N 2, so they can be overcome by stronger superradiant coupling.

Superradiance-enhanced quantum state transfer with time reversal

14

In the broader context of quantum control, this work is a novel example of using
a non-causal ﬁlter to achieve a coherent control goal. As we have performed a time
reversal on the quantum channel, the input ﬁeld to the receiver is both non-Markov
and non-causal [26]. There has been extensive work on solving causal ﬁltering problems
with coherent quantum components [30, 31, 32, 33, 34], but very little on coherent non-
causal ﬁlters. This is primarily because it has been unclear how to coherently implement
a non-causal ﬁlter. Here we see GEMs are an excellent candidate to perform coherent
non-causal ﬁltering of a signal. More complex non-causal ﬁlters could be produced by
reading out diﬀerent parts of the memory at diﬀerent times depending on the control
goal.

In summary, we have shown generic state transfer is possible by time-reversal of a
quantum channel. We have given an implementation of this protocol using rare-earth
ion crystals and a GEM. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that state transfer of rare-
earth ion ensembles is possible, and that the transfer ﬁdelity of ensembles can beneﬁt
from collective phenomena, namely, superradiance.

Appendix A. Simulations for coupling to the channel

In this appendix we describe the simulation methods and approximations used to provide
insight into the coupling between the emitter and quantum channel. We only need to
model the emitter in this case. The master equation for the emitter is:

N(cid:88)

˙ρem(t) = − i[Hem, ρem] + D[Lem](ρ) +

D[Lloss

em,j](ρ).

(A.1)

j=1

Where D[L](ρ) = LρL† − (L†Lρ + ρL†L)/2. We perform direct numerical simulations
of this master equation using the python package qutip [35, 36] for small N , which is
presented in ﬁgure 2. However, the dimension of the Hilbert space scales exponentially
with N , thus we need an approximate method for large N ; we choose to apply the
mean-ﬁeld approximation.

The mean ﬁeld approximation is applied by ﬁnding the equation of motion of the
em,j(cid:105), where k = x, y, z which
following expectation values: νem = (cid:104)cem(cid:105) and ς k
correspond to the appropriate Pauli matrices, then assuming all higher order expectation
em,j(cid:105) = νemς x
values can be factorized, e.g. (cid:104)cemσx
em,j. Applying this approximation we get
the following equations of motion:

em,j = (cid:104)σk

em,j(t) = 2gς z
˙ς x
˙ς y
em,j(t) = 2gς z

em,j(cid:60)(νem) − γς x

The equations of motion have an important symmetry: assuming the ions start in the
same state, they will remain in the same state. Furthermore we are primarily interested
in the average state of the ions, speciﬁcally: ¯ς k
em,j/N . Assuming that the
initial state of the emitter is |ψθ0,φ0(cid:105), we can simplify the equations of motion to:

em = ¯ς y

em = νem = 0 and ¯ς z

em = −1, the mean-ﬁeld predicts ˙νem = ˙¯ς k

We note that the mean-ﬁeld makes a nonphysical prediction, with regard to the coupling
between the cavity and the ions, that an unstable ﬁxed point exists. In particular, if
we set γ = 0 and have an initial condition of |ψθ0,φ0(cid:105) with θ0 = 0, which corresponds
to ¯ς x
em = 0. This
is nonphysical; if the ions start in an excited state the excitation will enter the cavity
and be emitted. Physically, this process involves correlations forming between the ions
and cavity, which the mean-ﬁeld has neglected. This results in the mean-ﬁeld being
overly conservative in its predictions of eﬃciency and ﬁdelity, making it best thought
of as a lower-bound. The numerical solutions to (A.6)-(A.9) presented in ﬁgure 2 were
completed with the python package scipy [37].

Appendix B. Simulations for ﬁdelity of transfer

We use two methods to simulate the full state transfer and determine the ﬁdelity: a
direct truncation method and a mean-ﬁeld method.

To perform a direct simulation for N = 1, we simulate the non-Hermitian

unnormalised wave equation of the total system [26]:
totalLtotal/2)| ˜ψ(cid:105).
†

| ˜ψ(t)(cid:105) = (−iHtotal − L

˙

(B.1)

We are considering the N = 1 case where all parts of the system are initially prepared
in their respective ground states except the emitter. Consequently, there will be at
most one excitation in the system at any given time. This allows us to truncate the
wavefunction to the following form

| ˜ψ(t)(cid:105) =

ψ0 +

dξψa(ξ)a†(ξ) +

(ψσ,lσ

Where ψ0(t), ψa(ξ, t), ψσ,l(t), ψc,l(t) are wavefunction coeﬃcients and |0(cid:105) refers to a state
where the ions are in the ground state with the GEM and cavities in their vacuum state.

Superradiance-enhanced quantum state transfer with time reversal

The linear dynamical equations for these coeﬃcients are:

˙ψσ,em(t) = gψc,em − γψσ,em/2,
˙ψc,em(t) = −gψσ,em − κψc,em/2,
˙ψa(ξ, t) = −is(t)ξψa(ξ) − ζ

˙ψc,re(t) = gψσ,re − κψc,re/2 +(cid:112)ζκψ(cid:48)

Where ψ(cid:48)

−Ξ dξψa(ξ).

dξ(cid:48)ψa(ξ(cid:48)) + i(cid:112)ζκψc,em,

Normally the non-Hermitian wave equation must be stochastically simulated many
times and averaged to get the density matrix of the system [26]. However after a jump
occurs the wave equation enters the state |0(cid:105), which is a dark steady state for the
non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. In this special case, we only have to simulate (B.1) once,
then the density matrix for the total system is ρtotal(t) = Pjump|0(cid:105)(cid:104)0| + | ˜ψ(cid:105)(cid:104) ˜ψ| where
Pjump = 1 − (cid:104) ˜ψ| ˜ψ(cid:105). We can use this density matrix to calculate the transfer ﬁdelities.
For large N we use a mean-ﬁeld approximation to estimate the ﬁdelity of the

transfer. We start with the master equation for the total system

˙ρtotal(t) = −i[Htotal, ρtotal] + D[Ltotal](ρ) +

We can calculate the transfer ﬁdelity from the mean-ﬁeld expectations by taking
advantage of the Pauli operator density matrix factorization: ρ = (σxς x + σyς y + σzς z +
I)/2. The initial state will be pure, hence we can factorize it as ¯ρem(0) = | ¯ψem(cid:105)(cid:104) ¯ψem|,
which we can use to simplify the ﬁdelity to F = (cid:104) ¯ψem(0)|¯ρre(2T )| ¯ψem(0)(cid:105). Replacing the
Pauli expansion for the emitter density matrix gives us the expression:

F = (ς x

em(0)ς x

em(0)ς y

re(2T ) + ς z

em(0)ς z

Simulations presented of (B.3)-(B.8) and (B.10)-(B.18) in ﬁgure 3 were performed
with the diﬀerential equation package XMDS2 [38].
In order to improve numerical
eﬃciency for the ﬁdelity scans, simulations of (B.3)-(B.8) and (B.10)-(B.18) presented
in ﬁgure 4 were performed using the broadband solution of the GEM (9) instead of
numerically solving (B.5) and (B.14), and were performed using the python package
