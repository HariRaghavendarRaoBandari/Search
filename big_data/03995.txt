Abstract

Dirac showed that in a (k − 1)-connected graph there is a path through each
k vertices. The path k-connectivity πk(G) of a graph G, which is a generalization
of Dirac’s notion, was introduced by Hager in 1986.
In this paper, we study path
connectivity of line graphs.

Keywords: connectivity, Steiner tree, packing, path connectivity, line graph.

Introduction

An interpersonal network is represented as a graph, where a node is a processor and
an edge is a communication link. Broadcasting is the process of sending a message from
the source node to all other nodes in a network.
It can be accomplished by message
dissemination in such a way that each node repeatedly receives and forwards messages.
Some of the nodes and/or links may be faulty. However, multiple copies of messages can
be disseminated through disjoint paths. We say that the broadcasting succeeds if all the
healthy nodes in the network ﬁnally obtain the correct message from the source node
within a certain limit of time. A lot of attention has been devoted to fault-tolerant broad-
casting in networks [13, 18, 20, 42]. In order to measure the degree of fault-tolerance, the
above disjoint path structure connecting two nodes is generalized into some tree structures
connecting more than two nodes, see [25, 27, 32]. To show the properties of these gener-
alizations clearly, we hope to state from the connectivity in Graph Theory. We divide our
introduction into the following four subsections to state the motivations and our results
of this paper.

1.1 Connectivity and k-connectivity

All graphs considered in this paper are undirected, ﬁnite and simple. We refer to [3] for
graph theoretical notation and terminology not described here. For a graph G, let V (G),
E(G) and δ(G) denote the set of vertices, the set of edges and the minimum degree of G,
respectively. For S ⊆ V (G), we denote by G − S the subgraph obtained by deleting from
G the vertices of S together with the edges incident with them. Connectivity is one of the
most basic concepts in graph theory, both in combinatorial sense and in algorithmic sense.
As we know, the classical connectivity has two equivalent deﬁnitions. The connectivity
of G, written κ(G), is the minimum size of a vertex set S ⊆ V (G) such that G − S is
disconnected or has only one vertex. We call this deﬁnition the ‘cut’ version deﬁnition of
connectivity. A well-known theorem of Whitney [44] provides an equivalent deﬁnition of
connectivity, which can be called the ‘path’ version deﬁnition of connectivity. For any two
distinct vertices x and y in G, the local connectivity κG(x, y) is the maximum number of
internally disjoint paths connecting x and y. Then κ(G) = min{κG(x, y) | x, y ∈ V (G), x 6=
y} is deﬁned to be the connectivity of G. Similarly, the classical edge-connectivity also has
two equivalent deﬁnitions. The edge-connectivity of G, written λ(G), is the minimum size
of an edge set M ⊆ E(G) such that G − M is disconnected or has only one vertex. We
call this deﬁnition the ‘cut’ version deﬁnition of edge-connectivity. For any two distinct
vertices x and y in G, the local edge-connectivity λG(x, y) is the maximum number of edge-
disjoint paths connecting x and y. Then λ(G) = min{λG(x, y) | x, y ∈ V (G), x 6= y} is
deﬁned to be the edge-connectivity of G, which can be called the ‘path’ version deﬁnition;
see [12]. For connectivity and edge-connectivity, Oellermann published a survey paper;
see [38].

Although there are many elegant and powerful results on connectivity in graph theory,
the classical connectivity and edge-connectivity cannot be satisﬁed considerably in practi-
cal uses. So people want some generalizations of both connectivity and edge-connectivity.
For the ‘cut’ version deﬁnition of connectivity, we are looking for a minimum vertex-cut
with no consideration about the number of components of G − S. Two graphs with the
same connectivity may have diﬀerent degrees of vulnerability in the sense that the dele-
tion of a vertex cut-set of minimum cardinality from one graph may produce a graph with
considerably more components than in the case of the other graph. For example, the star
K1,n and the path Pn+1 (n ≥ 3) are both trees of order n + 1 and therefore connectivity
1, but the deletion of a cut-vertex from K1,n produces a graph with n components while
the deletion of a cut-vertex from Pn+1 produces only two components. Chartrand et al.
[6] generalized the ‘cut’ version deﬁnition of connectivity. For an integer k (k ≥ 2) and a
graph G of order n (n ≥ k), the k-connectivity κ′
k(G) is the smallest number of vertices
whose removal from G produces a graph with at least k components or a graph with fewer
than k vertices. Thus, for k = 2, κ′
2(G) = κ(G). For more details about k-connectivity,
we refer to [6, 21, 38, 39]. The k-edge-connectivity, which is a generalization of the ‘cut’
version deﬁnition of classical edge-connectivity was initially introduced by Boesch and

2

Chen [4] and subsequently studied by Goldsmith in [22, 23] and Goldsmith et al. [24]. For
more details, we refer to [2, 37].

1.2 Generalized connectivity and generalized edge-connectivity

The generalized connectivity of a graph G, introduced by Hager [16], is a natural and
nice generalization of the ‘path’ version deﬁnition of connectivity. For a graph G = (V, E)
and a set S ⊆ V of at least two vertices, an S-Steiner tree or a Steiner tree connecting S
(or simply, an S-tree) is a subgraph T = (V ′, E ′) of G that is a tree with S ⊆ V ′. Two
Steiner trees T and T ′ connecting S are said to be internally disjoint if E(T ) ∩ E(T ′) = ∅
and V (T ) ∩ V (T ′) = S. For S ⊆ V (G) and |S| ≥ 2, the generalized local connectivity
κ(S) is the maximum number of internally disjoint Steiner trees connecting S in G. Note
that when |S| = 2 a minimal Steiner tree connecting S is just a path connecting the
two vertices of S. For an integer k with 2 ≤ k ≤ n, generalized k-connectivity (or k-
tree-connectivity) is deﬁned as κk(G) = min{κ(S) | S ⊆ V (G), |S| = k}. Clearly, when
|S| = 2, κ2(G) is nothing new but the connectivity κ(G) of G, that is, κ2(G) = κ(G),
which is the reason why one addresses κk(G) as the generalized connectivity of G. By
convention, for a connected graph G with less than k vertices, we set κk(G) = 1. Set
κk(G) = 0 when G is disconnected. This concept appears to have been introduced by
Hager in [16]. It is also studied in [7] for example, where the exact value of the generalized
k-connectivity of complete graphs are obtained. Note that the generalized k-connectivity
and the k-connectivity of a graph are indeed diﬀerent. Take for example, the graph H1
obtained from a triangle with vertex set {v1, v2, v3} by adding three new vertices u1, u2, u3
and joining vi to ui by an edge for 1 ≤ i ≤ 3. Then κ3(H1) = 1 but κ′
3(H1) = 2.
There are many results on the generalized connectivity or tree-connectivity, we refer to
[7, 26, 27, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 40].

The following Table 1 shows how the generalization proceeds.

Table 1. Classical connectivity and generalized connectivity

As a natural counterpart of the generalized connectivity, we introduced in [34] the
concept of generalized edge-connectivity, which is a generalization of the ‘path’ version

3

deﬁnition of edge-connectivity. For S ⊆ V (G) and |S| ≥ 2, the generalized local edge-
connectivity λ(S) is the maximum number of edge-disjoint Steiner trees connecting S in
G. For an integer k with 2 ≤ k ≤ n, the generalized k-edge-connectivity λk(G) of G is then
deﬁned as λk(G) = min{λ(S) | S ⊆ V (G) and |S| = k}. It is also clear that when |S| = 2,
λ2(G) is nothing new but the standard edge-connectivity λ(G) of G, that is, λ2(G) = λ(G),
which is the reason why we address λk(G) as the generalized edge-connectivity of G. Also
set λk(G) = 0 when G is disconnected. Results on the generalized edge-connectivity can
be found in [31, 34, 34].

1.3 Path connectivity and path edge-connectivity

Dirac [10] showed that in a (k − 1)-connected graph there is a path through each k
vertices. Related problems were inquired in [45]. In [17], Hager revised this statement to
the question of how many internally disjoint paths Pi with the exception of a given set S of
k vertices exist such that S ⊆ V (Pi). The path connectivity of a graph G, introduced by
Hager [17], is a natural specialization of the generalized connectivity and is also a natural
generalization of the ‘path’ version deﬁnition of connectivity. For a graph G = (V, E) and
a set S ⊆ V (G) of at least two vertices, a path connecting S (or simply, an S-path) is a
subgraph P = (V ′, E ′) of G that is a path with S ⊆ V ′. Note that a path connecting S
is also a tree connecting S. Two paths P and P ′ connecting S are said to be internally
disjoint if E(P ) ∩ E(P ′) = ∅ and V (P ) ∩ V (P ′) = S. For S ⊆ V (G) and |S| ≥ 2, the local
path connectivity πG(S) is the maximum number of internally disjoint paths connecting S
in G, that is, we search for the maximum cardinality of edge-disjoint paths which contain
S and are vertex-disjoint with the exception of the vertices in S. For an integer k with
2 ≤ k ≤ n, the path k-connectivity is deﬁned as πk(G) = min{πG(S) | S ⊆ V (G), |S| = k},
that is, πk(G) is the minimum value of πG(S) when S runs over all k-subsets of V (G).
Clearly, π1(G) = δ(G) and π2(G) = κ(G). For k ≥ 3, πk(G) ≤ κk(G) holds because each
path is also a tree.

The relation between generalized connectivity and path connectivity are shown in the

following Table 2.

Table 2. Two kinds of tree-connectivities

As a natural counterpart of path k-connectivity, we recently introduced the concept of

4

path k-edge-connectivity. Two paths P and P ′ connecting S are said to be edge-disjoint
if E(P ) ∩ E(P ′) = ∅. For S ⊆ V (G) and |S| ≥ 2, the path local edge-connectivity ωG(S) is
the maximum number of edge-disjoint paths connecting S in G. For an integer k with 2 ≤
k ≤ n, the path k-edge-connectivity is deﬁned as ωk(G) = min{ωG(S) | S ⊆ V (G), |S| = k},
that is, ωk(G) is the minimum value of ωG(S) when S runs over all k-subsets of V (G).
Clearly, we have

ωk(G) = δ(G),
ωk(G) = λ(G),
ωk(G) ≤ λk(G),

for k = 1;
for k = 2;
for k ≥ 3.

The following observation is immediate.

Observation 1.1 (1) Let G be a connected graph. Then πk(G) ≤ ωk(G) ≤ δ(G).

(2) Let G be a connected graph with minimum degree δ. If G has two adjacent vertices

of degree δ, then πk(G) ≤ ωk(G) ≤ δ − 1.

Lemma 1.2 [16] Let k, n be two integers with 3 ≤ k ≤ n, and let Kn be a complete graph
of order n. Then

πk(Kn) = (cid:22) 2n + k2 − 3k
2(k − 1) (cid:23) .

Note that each graph is a spanning subgraph of a complete graph. So the following

result is immediate.

Observation 1.3 Let k, n be two integers with 3 ≤ k ≤ n, and let G be a graph of order
n. Then

0 ≤ πk(G) ≤ (cid:22) 2n + k2 − 3k
2(k − 1) (cid:23) .

Lemma 1.4 Let G be a graph of order n. If n is even, then π3(G) = n
is a complete graph of order n.

is the unique graph with this property. We only need to show that πk(Kn \ uv) < n
2 − 1
for any uv ∈ E(Kn). Pick one vertex w ∈ V (Kn) − {u, v}. Choose S = {u, v, w}.
If
we choose uvw as a path, then any other S-Steiner path occupies at least two vertices
of V (G) − S, and hence π(S) ≤ 1 + ⌊ n−3
2 ⌋ = n
2 − 1. Suppose that uv and vw belong to
diﬀerent S-Steiner path. Then π(S) ≤ 2 + ⌊ n−5

paths. So the following result is immediate.

1.4 Application background of these parameters

In addition to being a natural combinatorial measure, the path k-(edge-)connectivity
and generalized k-(edge-)connectivity can be motivated by their interesting interpretation
in practice. For example, suppose that G represents a network. If one considers to connect
a pair of vertices of G, then a path is used to connect them. However, if one wants to
connect a set S of vertices of G with |S| ≥ 3, then a tree has to be used to connect
them. This kind of tree for connecting a set of vertices is usually called a Steiner tree,
and popularly used in the physical design of VLSI circuits (see [14, 15, 41]).
In this
application, a Steiner tree is needed to share an electric signal by a set of terminal nodes.
Steiner tree is also used in computer communication networks (see [11]) and optical wireless
communication networks (see [9]). Usually, one wants to consider how tough a network can
be, for the connection of a set of vertices. Then, the number of totally independent ways
to connect them is a measure for this purpose. The path k-connectivity and generalized
k-connectivity can serve for measuring the capability of a network G to connect any k
vertices in G.

1.5 Main results of this paper

Chartrand and Stewart [8] investigated the relation between the connectivity and edge-

connectivity of a graph and its line graph.

Theorem 1.8 [8] If G is a connected graph, then

(1) κ(L(G)) ≥ λ(G) if λ(G) ≥ 2.

(2) λ(L(G)) ≥ 2λ(G) − 2.

(3) κ(L(L(G))) ≥ 2κ(G) − 2.

In Section 2, we investigate the relation between the path connectivity and path edge-

connectivity of a graph and its line graph.

6

In their book, Capobianco and Molluzzo [5], using K1,n as their example, note that the
diﬀerence between the connectivity of a graph and its line graph can be arbitrarily large.
They then proposed an open problem: Whether for any two integers p, q (1 < p < q),
there exists a graph G such that κ(G) = p and κ(L(G)) = q. In [1], Bauer and Tindell
gave a positive answer of this problem, that is, for every pair of integers p, q (1 < p < q)
there is a graph of connectivity p whose line graph has connectivity q.

Note that the diﬀerence between the path k-connectivity of a graph G and its line
graph L(G) can be also arbitrarily large. Let n, k be two integers with 2 ≤ k ≤ n, and

−3k

let G = K1,n. Then L(G) = Kn, πk(G) = 0 and πk(L(G)) = j 2n+k2

2(k−1) k. In fact, we can

consider a similar problem: Whether for any two integers p, q, 1 < p < q, there exists a
graph G such that πk(G) = p and πk(L(G)) = q. It seem to be not easy to solve this
problem for a general k.
In this paper, we focus our attention on the case k = 3 and
q ≥ 2p − 1, and give a positive answer of this problem.

2 Path connectivity of line graphs

Hager [16] obtain the following result.

Lemma 2.1 [16] Let G be a graph of order n, and let k be an integer with 3 ≤ k ≤ n. If
κ(G) ≥ 2k−2ℓ, then πk(G) ≥ ℓ.

Corollary 2.2 Let G be a graph of order n, and let k be an integer with 3 ≤ k ≤ n. Then

22−kκ(G) ≤ πk(G) ≤ κ(G).

For general k, we can easily derive the following result.

Proposition 2.3 Let G be a graph of order n. If G is 2-edge-connected, then

(1) 22−kωk(G) ≤ πk(L(G));
(2) ωk(L(G)) ≥ 22−kωk(G);
(3) πk(L(L(G)) ≥ 23−k(πk(G) − 1).

Proof. For (1), from Corollary 2.2 and Theorem 1.8, we have

πk(L(G)) ≥ 22−kκ(L(G)) ≥ 22−kλ(G) ≥ 22−kκ(G) ≥ 22−kπk(G).

For (2), from (1) of this proposition, Corollary 2.2 and Theorem 1.8, we have

ωk(L(G)) ≥ πk(L(G)) ≥ 22−kκ(L(G)) ≥ 22−kλ(G) ≥ 22−kωk(G).

For (3), from (1) of this proposition and Corollary 2.2, we have

πk(L(L(G))) ≥ 22−kκ(L(L(G))) ≥ 22−k(2κ(G) − 2) = 23−k(κ(G) − 1) ≥ 23−k(πk(G) − 1).

7

For k = 3, we can improve the above result, and obtain the following theorem.

Theorem 2.4 Let G be a 2-connected. Then

(1) ω3(G) ≤ π3(L(G)).

(2) ω3(L(G)) ≥ ω3(G) − 1.

(3) π3(L(L(G)) ≥ π3(G) − 1.

Proof.
such that ω3(G) = ℓ with ℓ ≥ 1. Let e1 = v1v′
G corresponding to the vertices e1, e2, e3 in L(G), respectively.

For (1), let e1, e2, e3 be three arbitrary distinct vertices of the line graph of G
3 be those edges of

1, e2 = v2v′

Consider three distinct vertices of the six end-vertices of e1, e2, e3. Without loss of
generality, let S = {v1, v2, v3} be three distinct vertices. Since ω3(G) = ℓ, there exist ℓ
edge-disjoint S-Steiner paths in G, say P1, P2, · · · , Pℓ. We deﬁne a minimal S-Steiner path
P as an S-Steiner path whose sub-path obtained by deleting any edge of P does not connect
S. Choosing any two edge-disjoint minimal S-Steiner paths Pi and Pj (1 ≤ i, j ≤ ℓ) in G,

we will show that the paths P ′
j corresponding to Pi and Pj in L(G) are internally
disjoint S-Steiner paths. It is easy to see that Pi ∪ Pj has two possible types, as shown
in Figure 1. Since Pi and Pj are edge-disjoint in G, we can ﬁnd internally disjoint Steiner
paths P ′
j connecting e1, e2, e3 in L(G). We give an example of Type a, see Figure

3 Graphs with prescribed path connectivity and path edge-

connectivity

In [16], Hager got the following result.

Lemma 3.1 [16] Let Ka,b be a complete bipartite graph with a + b vertices, and let k be
an integer with 2 ≤ k ≤ a + b. Then

πk(Ka,b) = min(cid:26) a

k − 1

,

b

k − 1(cid:27) .

The following corollary is immediate from the above theorem.

Corollary 3.2 Let a, b be two integers with 2 ≤ a ≤ b, and Ka,b denote a complete
bipartite graph with a bipartition of sizes a and b, respectively. Then

π3(Ka,b) = j a
2k .

In this section, we consider the problem mentioned in Subsection 1.5 for the case q ≥
2p − 1. Let us put our attention on the complete bipartite graph G = K2p,2q−2p+2. Since
q ≥ 2p−1, it follows that 2q −2p+2 ≥ 2p. From Corollary 3.2, π3(G) = π3(K2p,2q−2p+2) =
p. Now we turn to consider the line graph of complete bipartite graph G = K2p,2q−2p+2.

Recall that the Cartesian product (also called the square product) of two graphs G and
H, written as G(cid:3)H, is the graph with vertex set V (G) × V (H), in which two vertices
(u, v) and (u′, v′) are adjacent if and only if u = u′ and (v, v′) ∈ E(H), or v = v′ and
(u, u′) ∈ E(G). Clearly, the Cartesian product is commutative, that is, G(cid:3)H ∼= H (cid:3)G.

The following lemma is from [43].

9

Lemma 3.3 [43] For a complete bipartite graph Kr,s, L(Kr,s) = Kr(cid:3)Ks.

From the above lemma, L(G) = L(K2p,2q−2p+2) = K2p(cid:3)K2q−2p+2. In order to obtain
the exact value of π3(L(G)) = π3(K2p(cid:3)K2q−2p+2), we consider to determine the exact
value of the Cartesian product of two complete graphs.

Before proving Lemma 3.4, we deﬁne some notation. Let G and H be two connected
graphs with V (G) = {u1, u2, . . . , un} and V (H) = {v1, v2, . . . , vm}, respectively. Then
V (G ◦ H) = {(ui, vj) | 1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ j ≤ m}. For v ∈ V (H), we use G(v) to denote
the subgraph of G ◦ H induced by the vertex set {(ui, v) | 1 ≤ i ≤ n}. Similarly, for
u ∈ V (G), we use H(u) to denote the subgraph of G ◦ H induced by the vertex set
{(u, vj ) | 1 ≤ j ≤ m}.

Lemma 3.4 Let p, q be two integers with p ≥ 2 and q ≥ 3. Then

π3(K2p(cid:3)K2q−2p+2) = q.

Let G = K2p and H = K2q−2p+2. Set V (G) = {u1, u2, · · · , u2p} and V (H) =

Proof.
{v1, v2, · · · , v2q−2p+2}. From Lemma 1.4, we have

π3(G(cid:3)H) = π3(K2p(cid:3)K2q−2p+2) ≤ π3(K2q+2) ≤ q.

It suﬃces to show that π3(G(cid:3)H) ≥ q. We need to show that for any S = {x, y, z} ⊆
V (G(cid:3)H), there exist q internally disjoint S-Steiner paths. We complete our proof by the
following three cases.

Case 1. x, y, z belongs to the same V (H(ui)) (1 ≤ i ≤ r).

Without loss of generality, we assume x, y, z ∈ V (H(u1)). Since π3(H) = π3(K2q−2p+2)
= q − p + 1, there exist q − p + 1 internally disjoint S-Steiner paths P1, P2, · · · , Pq−p+1 in
H(u1). Let xj , yj, zj be the vertices corresponding to x, y, z in H(uj) (2 ≤ j ≤ 2p). Then
the paths Qi induced by the edges in {xx2i, x2iy2i, y2iy, yy2i+1, y2i+1z2i+1, z2i+1z} (1 ≤ i ≤
p − 1) are p − 1 internally disjoint S-Steiner paths. These paths together with the paths
P1, P2, · · · , Pq−p+1 are q internally disjoint S-Steiner paths, as deisred.

Case 2. Only two vertices of {x, y, z} belong to some copy H(ui).

We may assume x, y ∈ V (H(u1)), z ∈ V (H(u2)). Let x′, y′ be the vertices correspond-

ing to x, y in H(u2), and let z ′ be the vertex corresponding to z in H(u1).

Suppose z ′

6∈ {x, y}. Without loss of generality, let x = (u1, v1), y = (u1, v2) and
z ′ = (u1, v3). Then the path Q1 induced by the edges in {xy, yy′, y′z}, the path Q2 induced
by the edges in {xx′, x′z, zz ′, z ′y} and Pi induced by the edges in {x(u1, v2i), (u1, v2i)y,
y(u1, v2i+1), (u1, v2i+1)(u2, v2i+1), (u2, v2i+1)z} (2 ≤ i ≤ q−p) are q−p+1 internally disjoint
S-Steiner paths. Note that all the edges of these paths are between H(u1) and H(u2). Let
xj, yj , zj be the vertices corresponding to x, y, z ′ in H(uj) (3 ≤ j ≤ 2p). The the paths Qj
induced by the edges in {xx2j+1, x2j+1y2j+1, x2j+1y, yy2j+2, y2j+2z2j+2, z2j+2z} (1 ≤ j ≤

p − 1) are p − 1 internally disjoint S-Steiner paths. These paths together with the paths
Q1, Q2, P2, P3, · · · , Pq−p are q internally disjoint S-Steiner paths, as desired.

Suppose z ′ ∈ {x, y}. Without loss of generality, let x = (u1, v1) and y = (u1, v2).
Then the path Q induced by the edges in {xy, yz} and Pj induced by the edges in
{x(u1, v2j−1), (u1, v2j−1)y, y(u1, v2j), (u1, v2j)(u2, v2j), (u2, v2j)z} (2 ≤ j ≤ q − p + 1) are
q − p + 1 internally disjoint S-Steiner paths. Let xj, yj , zj be the vertices correspond-
ing to x, y, z ′
in H(uj) (3 ≤ j ≤ 2p). Then the paths Qi induced by the edges in
{xx2i+1, x2i+1y2i+1, y2i+1y, yy2i+2, y2i+2z2i+2, z2i+2z} (1 ≤ i ≤ p − 1) are p − 1 internally
disjoint S-Steiner paths. These paths together with the paths Q, P1, P2, · · · , Pq−p are q
internally disjoint S-Steiner paths, as desired.

Case 3. x, y, z are contained in distinct H(ui)s.

We may assume that x ∈ V (H(u1)), y ∈ V (H(u2)), z ∈ V (H(u3)). Let y′, z ′ be
the vertices corresponding to y, z in H(u1), x′, z ′′ be the vertices corresponding to x, z in
H(u2) and x′′, y′′ be the vertices corresponding to x, y in H(u3).

Suppose that x, y′, z ′ are distinct vertices in H(u1). Without loss of generality, let
x = (u1, v1), y = (u2, v2) and z = (u3, v3). Let xj, yj , zj be the vertices correspond-
ing to x, y, z ′
in H(uj) (4 ≤ j ≤ 2p). Then the path R1 induced by the edges in
{xx′, yx′, yy′′, y′′z}, the path R2 induced by the edges in {xy′, yy′, yz ′′, z ′′z}, the path
R3 induced by the edges in {xz ′, zz ′, yy2p, y2pz2p, z2pz} and Pj induced by the edges in
{x(u1, v2j), (u1, v2j)(u2, v2j ), y(u2, v2j), y(u2, v2j+1), (u2, v2j+1)(u3, v2j+1), (u3, v2j+1)z} (2 ≤
j ≤ q −p) are q −p+2 internally disjoint S-Steiner paths. The the paths Qi induced by the
edges in {xx2i−1, x2i−1y2i−1, y2i−1y, yy2i, y2iz2i, z2iz} (2 ≤ i ≤ p−1) are p−2 internally dis-
joint S-Steiner paths. These paths together with the trees R1, R2, R3, P2, P3, · · · , Pq−p−1
are q internally disjoint S-Steiner paths, as desired.

Suppose that two of x, y′, z ′ are the same vertex in H(u1). Without loss of generality,
let x = (u1, v1), y = (u2, v1) and z = (u3, v2). Let xj , yj, zj be the vertices corresponding to
x, y, z ′ in H(uj) (4 ≤ j ≤ 2p). Then the path R1 induced by the edges in {xy, yx′′, x′′z}, the
path R2 induced by the edges in {xx2p, x2py2p, y2py, yz ′′, z ′′z} and Pj induced by the edges
in {x(u1, v2j−1), (u1, v2j−1)(u2, v2j−1), (u2, v2j−1)y, y(u2, v2j), (u2, v2j )(u3, v2j), (u3, v2j)z}
(2 ≤ j ≤ q − p + 1) are q − p + 2 internally disjoint S-Steiner paths. The the paths
Qi induced by the edges in {xx2i−1, x2i−1y2i−1, y2i−1y, yy2i, y2iz2i, z2iz} (2 ≤ i ≤ p −
1) are p − 2 internally disjoint S-Steiner paths. These paths together with the paths
R1, R2, P2, P3, · · · , Pq−p+1 are q internally disjoint S-Steiner paths, as desired.

Suppose that x, y′, z ′ are the same vertex in H(u1). Without loss of generality,
let x = (u1, v1), y = (u2, v1) and z = (u3, v1). Then the path R1 induced by the
edges in {xy, yz}, the path R2 induced by the edges in {xz, y(u2, v2q−2p+2), (u2, v2q−2p+2)
(u3, v2q−2p+2), (u3, v2q−2p+2)z} and Pj induced by the edges in {x(u1, v2j), (u1, v2j )(u2, v2j),
y(u2, v2j), y(u2, v2j+1), (u2, v2j+1)(u3, v2j+1), (u3, v2j+1)z} (1 ≤ j ≤ q − p) are q − p + 2 in-
ternally disjoint S-Steiner paths. Let xj , yj, zj be the vertices corresponding to x, y, z ′ in

11

H(uj) (4 ≤ j ≤ 2p). The the paths Qi induced by the edges in {xx2i, x2iy2i, y2iy, yy2i+1,
y2i+1z2i+1, z2i+1z} (2 ≤ i ≤ p − 1) are p − 2 internally disjoint S-Steiner paths. These
paths together with the paths R1, R2, P1, P2, · · · , Pq−p are q internally disjoint S-Steiner
paths, as desired.

From the above argument, we conclude that for any S = {x, y, z} ⊆ V (G(cid:3)H), there
exist q internally disjoint S-Steiner paths, and hence π(S) ≥ q. From the arbitraries of S,
we have πk(G) = q.

From Lemma 3.4, the following result holds.

Theorem 3.5 For any two integers p, q with q ≥ 2p − 1, p ≥ 2 and q ≥ 3, there exists a
graph G such that π3(G) = p and π3(L(G)) = q.
