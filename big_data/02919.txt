appear diﬀerent nonlinear coherent modes. Here we concentrate on two types of such coherent
modes, vortex ring solitons and vortex rings. In a cylindrical trap, vortex ring solitons can be
characterized as nonlinear Hermite-Laguerre modes, whose description can be done by means
of optimized perturbation theory. The energy, required for creating vortex ring solitons, is
larger than that needed for forming vortex rings. This is why, at a moderate excitation energy,
vortex rings appear before vortex ring solitons. The generation of vortex rings is illustrated by
numerical simulations for trapped 87Rb atoms.

1. Introduction
Nonlinear Schr¨odinger (NLS) equation exhibits diﬀerent kinds of soliton-like solutions. Various
solitonic solutions are well known for the NLS equation in nonlinear optics [1, 2] and in Bose-
Einstein condensates [3, 4]. The behavior of solitons in both these nonlinear media possesses
many common features [5, 6].

Here we concentrate on two types of solutions to the NLS equation, vortex ring solitons and
vortex rings. The theoretical study of such solutions is usually based on the assumption of
their existence at the initial moment of time, after which one considers their temporal dynamics
starting from the given initial condition. In a realistic situation, in order to create a soliton
in a Bose-condensed system, it is necessary to apply an external perturbation rendering the
condensate strongly nonequilibrium. There are several ways of perturbing the system. Trap
rotation or laser rotation inside a trap is known to produce quantum vortices and vortex
lattices [7]. To generate a variety of other coherent modes, it has been suggested [8–10] to
shake the condensed system, which can be realized either by trap shaking [8–11] or by scattering
length modulation [12,13]. A special variant of a double-loop pattern of laser stirring [14] shows
the eﬀect similar to trap shaking.

Ring dark solitons are known in optics [15] and in Bose-Einstein condensate [8–11, 16, 17].
Ring vortex solitons can be stable for weak atomic repulsion, but become unstable for suﬃciently
strong eﬀective repulsion, such as is typical for trapped atoms. However, their lifetime can be
rather long, of order of seconds, which allows one to treat them as metastable objects [18, 19].

Note that bright vortex solitons, existing for attractive atomic interactions, are unstable in three
dimensions [20, 21].

In the presence of external perturbations, vortex ring solitons experience snake instability [22]
and can split into multiple fragments [19], and ﬁnally decay into vortex rings [23, 24]. A
reconnection between vortex lines can also lead to the emission of vortex rings [25, 26].

In the present paper, we consider the situation, when Bose-condensed trapped atoms are
subject to an external perturbation, which corresponds to trap shaking. The setup is explained
in Sec. 2. Such trap shaking can generate diﬀerent nonlinear coherent modes, including vortices
and ring vortex solitons [8–11]. The deﬁnition of coherent modes, as stationary solutions to
the NLS equation, is given in Sec. 3. When the eﬀective coupling parameter is asymptotically
small, it is possible to approximate the solutions to the NLS equation by Gauss-Laguerre modes.
We show that, even for arbitrarily strong coupling parameter, nonlinear coherent modes can be
well characterized by Hermite-Laguerre modes, provided the description is done by means of
optimized perturbation theory [27, 28].

In our previous papers [29–32], we have demonstrated that by shaking a trapped Bose-Einstein
condensate, we can generate the following nonequilibrium states: weak nonequilibrium, vortex
state, vortex turbulence, grain turbulence, and wave turbulence. Analyzing now in more detail
the initial stage of weak nonequilibrium, we numerically simulate the three-dimensional NLS
equation and ﬁnd out that, when no special resonance conditions are involved, in the regime
of moderately strong perturbations, vortex rings arise. This happens yet before vortices start
appearing in the vortex stage and far before vortex turbulence develops. The results of the
numerical simulation, observing vortex rings, are presented in Sec. 4.

To summarize, in the present paper we show the following:
(i) We demonstrate that vortex ring solitons, that are a particular case of nonlinear coherent
modes, can be characterized as Hermite-Laguerre modes, provided optimized perturbation
theory is used. By vortex ring solitons, we understand circular dark solitons with circulation
around the trap axis.

(ii) A vortex ring is deﬁned as a circular line of zero density, with circulation around each of
its elements. By numerical simulations, we show that a moderate trap shaking produces vortex
rings in a trapped 87Rb.

(iii) We explain why vortex rings arise before vortex ring solitons and even before vortices.
This is because the generation of vortex rings requires much less energy than that needed for
the creation of other nonlinear coherent modes, including vortices and vortex ring solitons.

2. Shaken trap setup
We consider Bose atoms in a trap described by the harmonic trap potential

x + r2
where r2

where N is the number of atoms.

Temperature is assumed to be low, so that almost all atoms are in the Bose condensed
state. The shape of the atomic cloud in the trap can be estimated in the Thomas-Fermi
approximation [7], which yields the cloud radius

and the cloud length

Trap shaking is accomplished by imposing an additional time-dependent potential, resulting

in the total potential

consisting of the stationary conﬁning potential U (r) and an alternating potential V (r, t). The
latter is chosen so that to vibrate the trap without rotation. The shaking potential has the form

(10)

The primed variables x′, y′, and z′ are shifted and tilted with respect to the original spatial
variables x, y, and z, as is explained in Ref. [33].

3. Vortex ring solitons
Vortex ring solitons are a particular case of nonlinear coherent modes that can be introduced as
solutions to the NLS equation possessing a circulation around the trap axis, characterized by a
nonzero winding number. Coherent modes can be generated by strongly shaking a trap. In a
cylindrical trap, coherent modes can be represented as Hermite-Laguerre modes, which can be
done not only for weak interactions, but for any strong atomic interactions, provided Optimized
Perturbation Theory [27, 28] is employed.

Stationary states of Bose-condensed atoms are described by the stationary NLS equation

ˆH[η]η(r) = Eη(r) ,

with the nonlinear Hamiltonian

ˆH[η] = −

The normalization condition for the condensate function is

Then, with the dimensionless Hamiltonian

the eigenvalue problem (11) reads as

ˆH[ψnmj]ψnmj(r, ϕ, z) = Enmjψnmj(r, ϕ, z) .

In Figs. 1, 2, and 3, we present the radial density of coherent modes for diﬀerent quantum
numbers. The radial number n deﬁnes the number of nodes, while the winding number m
characterizes circulation. For numerical calculations, we accept the parameters as in our previous
experiments with 87Rb, described in Refs. [29–33], where

α = 0.11 ,

g = 1.96 × 104 ,

αg = 2.156 × 103 .

For comparison, we present vortex solutions, with nonzero m, and non-circulating solutions,
with m = 0.

4. Generation of vortex rings
The typical radii of rings appearing in a trap are much larger than the coherence length lc and,
clearly, smaller than the trap radius R,

Ring characteristics can be estimated resorting to the Thomas-Fermi approximation [7].

Normalizing the Thomas-Fermi condensate function yields the condensate energy

Taking the latter for estimating the coherence length gives

ρ(0) = 0.537

lc = Rs 4πL

15gl⊥

(33)

The vortex ring characteristics have been considered by Iordanskii [34], Amit and Gross [35],
Roberts and Grant [36], and Jones and Roberts [37]. Following Refs. [35, 36], for the energy of
a vortex ring, in units of ω⊥, we have

ER = 2π2ρrRl2

⊥ ln(cid:18)2.25

rR

lc (cid:19) ,

(34)

where the density ρ is to be taken at the location of the ring.

Since the density is smaller close the boundary of a trapped atomic cloud, we expect that it
is easier to create rings close to the boundary, since this requires smaller energy. The following
numerical simulations conﬁrm this.

Generally, a vortex ring moves with velocity that, far from the cloud edges, can be estimated

as

vR =



2mrR

ln(cid:18)6.12

rR

lc (cid:19) ,

(35)

the velocity being directed perpendicular to the ring plane. The ring possesses a stationary
position (although nonequilibrium) when its radius is rR ∼ 0.6 R. But in the standard
situation the ring has an inherent tendency to propagate along the z axis.
In a trap, the
ring oscillates [38, 39]. Estimating the period of the ring oscillation [40] one has

TR ∼

.

4πR/lc

ωzpln(R/lc)

(36)

Substituting here the expressions for R and lc, we ﬁnd

TR ∼

4π(αg)2/5

ωzpln(0.5αg)

.

(37)

For the accepted setup, where ωz = 2π × 23 Hz, we get TR ∼ 0.7s.
We accomplish numerical solution of the NLS equation, with the shaking potential (9), using
the method of Ref. [41]. It turns out that the ﬁrst nonequilibrium stage of perturbation, classiﬁed
in Refs. [30–32] as the regime of weak nonequilibrium, is not as dull. At this stage, there are
yet no vortices. However, there appear vortex rings. A vortex ring is deﬁned as a circular line
of zero density, with a winding number ±1 around each of the line elements. Numerically, zero
density implies 10−8ρ(0). Some typical vortex rings are shown in Fig. 4. Rings usually appear
in pairs, so that their total number is even.

In order to understand why vortex rings appear before vortices, we need to compare their

energies. The energy of a vortex of length L can be written [7, 31, 32] as

EL =

2π
3

ρ(0)l2

⊥L ln(cid:18)0.949

R

lc(cid:19) ,

(38)

where ρ(0) is the density at the trap center. Since the total number of atoms, in the Thomas-
Fermi approximation, is

ρ(0)R2L ,

(39)

it is also possible to write

N ≡Z ρ(r) dr =

4π
15

EL =

5l2
⊥

2R2 N ln(cid:18)0.949

R

lc(cid:19) .

Comparing the vortex energy (38) with the ring energy (34), we take rR ∼ 0.6R, which
gives the relation ρ(rR) ∼ 0.7ρ(0) between the atomic density close to the ring location and the
density at the center. Then we obtain

ER
EL ∼ α .

(40)

In the considered setup, α ∼ 0.1. Hence the ring energy is an order smaller than the vortex
energy. Therefore it is much easier to generate vortex rings, requiring to pump into the system
much less energy than that needed for producing vortices. It is possible to expect that up to
around ten vortex rings could be generated before vortices will start arising. The energy of
other coherent modes, including vortex ring solitons is larger than that of basis vortices with
the winding number ±1. Hence their appearance is even less probable than that of the simple
vortices, unless special resonant conditions are imposed.

5. Conclusion
We have analyzed the possibility of creating vortex ring solitons and vortex rings in a shaken
Bose-Einstein condensate of trapped atoms. The consideration is based on the NLS equation,
assuming that practically all atoms are condensed. Vortex ring solitons are dark solitonic
solutions, with circulation around the symmetry axis of the trap. Vortex rings are circular
vortices with circulation around each of their elements. Vortex ring solitons can be described
analytically by solving the NLS equation using optimized perturbation theory. This solution is
valid for an arbitrary strength of atomic interactions, contrary to the simple perturbation theory
admissible for only very weak interactions.

Numerical simulation of the three-dimensional NLS equation demonstrates the appearance
of vortex rings. This happens in the regime of a rather moderate perturbation, yet before

vortices could arise. That regime corresponds to the weak nonequilibrium stage, according to
the classiﬁcation of Refs. [30–32].

The energy of a vortex ring is essentially smaller than that of a basic vortex with circulation
±1. In turn, the energy of a simple vortex is smaller than that of other coherent modes, including
vortex ring solitons [42,43]. This explains why, under moderate trap shaking, vortex rings appear
long before vortices, since their generation requires much less energy to be injected into the trap.
Even if higher-energy coherent modes would be produced at the initial moment of time, they
would disintegrate into the lower-energy modes, such as vortices and vortex rings. Vortex rings
can also occur in the stage of vortex turbulence [44, 45]. However, to reach this regime requires
much stronger trap shaking. The investigation of the possible vortex-ring creation under vortex
turbulence, realized by trap shaking, is in the progress.
