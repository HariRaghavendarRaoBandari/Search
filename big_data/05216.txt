We report high-pressure muon-spin rotation and magnetization experiments on the magnetic
and the superconducting properties of the cuprate system La2−xBaxCuO4 with x = 0.155 (LBCO-
0.155). As a remarkable result, this bulk superconductor LBCO-0.155 exhibits static spin-stripe
order. Moreover, the superconducting (SC) transition temperature Tc and the spin-stripe order
temperature Tso nearly coincide (Tc(p) (cid:39) Tso(p)) at all p investigated (0 ≤ p ≤ 2.3 GPa). We also
observed a pressure induced transition from long-range spin stripe order to a disordered magnetic
state at p(cid:63) (cid:39) 1.6 GPa, coexisting with a SC state with substantial superﬂuid density. These results
together with the observed phase seperation between the SC and the long-range magnetic state
indicate that static magnetic order and SC pairing correlations develop in a cooperative fashion
in LBCO-0.155, and provide a new route of understanding the complex interplay between static
magnetism and superconductivity in the stripe phase of cuprates.

INTRODUCTION

Cuprate high-temperature superconductors (HTSs)
have complex phase diagrams with multiple compet-
ing ordered phases.
One of the most astonishing
manifestations of this competition occurs in the sys-
tem La2−xBaxCuO4 (LBCO) [1], where the bulk su-
perconducting (SC) transition temperature Tc exhibits
a deep minimum at x = 1/8 [2–4]. At this doping
level neutron and x-ray diﬀraction experiments revealed
two-dimensional static charge and spin-stripe order [5–
9]. While the relevance of stripe correlations for high-
temperature superconductivity remains a subject of con-
troversy, the collected experimental data indicate that
the tendency toward uni-directional stripe-like ordering
is common to cuprates [3, 4, 10, 11]. Exploring the role
of stripe formation for the occurence of high-temperature
superconductivity in cuprates is paramount to elucidate
the microscopic pairing mechanism.

La1.48Nd0.4Sr0.12CuO4, coexisting with the ordering
of static spin-stripes, but with frustrated phase order
between the layers [12–16]. On the theoretical front, the
concept of a sinusoidally modulated [pair-density wave
(PDW)] SC order (with the same period as the spin
correlations so that its amplitude varies from positive
to negative) was introduced, which is intimately inter-
twined with spatially modulated antiferromagnetism
[17–19]. It has been proposed that both the PDW and
the uniform d-wave states are close competitors for the
SC ground state [17–19].

Motivated by the question whether

the PDW

state is relevant at hole concentrations x (cid:54)= 1/8 in
La2−xBaxCuO4, Xu et. al.
investigated the system
La2−xBaxCuO4 with x = 0.095 using inelastic neutron
scattering [20]. In this bulk superconductor with Tc = 32
K low energy, incommensurate quasi-static antiferromag-
netic spin correlations were observed. The coexistence
of bulk superconductivity and antiferromagnetic (AFM)
spin correlations was explained in terms of a spatially
modulated and intertwined pair wave function [17–20].
There are only a few reports proposing the relevance of
a PDW state in suﬃciently underdoped La2−xSrxCuO4
[21] and YBa2Cu3O6−x [22, 23]. At present it is still un-
clear to what extent PDW order is a common feature of
cuprate systems where stripe order occurs.

Recently, magnetism and superconductivity in LBCO-
1/8, where the stripe order is most stable and magnetism
occupies nearly the full volume of the sample, were stud-
ied by means of the muon-spin rotation (µSR) technique
as a function of pressure up to p (cid:39) 2.2 GPa [24]. It was
found that application of hydrostatic pressure leads to
a remarkable decrease/increase of the magnetic/SC vol-
ume fraction. But even at the highest applied pressure
the spin order is long-range and occupies a substantial
fraction of the sample. Because of the pressure limit, we
were not able to investigate whether it is possible to com-
pletely suppress magnetic order and fully restore super-
conductivity in the stripe phase under pressure. Such an
investigation will give important hints for the relevance
of the concept of intertwined coexistence of magnetism
and superconductivity in striped cuprates.

In this work, we report on high pressure µSR (pmax
= 2.2 GPa) and magnetization (pmax = 3.1 GPa) stud-
ies of the magnetic and superconducting properties of
polycrystalline La2−xBaxCuO4 with x = 0.155 (LBCO-

EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

Sample preparation

Polycrystalline samples of La2−xBaxCuO4 with x =
0.155 were prepared by the conventional solid-state reac-
tion method using La2O3, BaCO3, and CuO. The single-
phase character of the samples was checked by powder
x-ray diﬀraction. All the measurements were performed
on samples from the same batch.

Pressure cells for magnetization and µSR

experiments

Pressures up to 2.3 GPa were generated in a double
wall piston-cylinder type of cell made of MP35N mate-
rial, especially designed to perform µSR experiments un-
der pressure [26, 27]. As a pressure transmitting medium
Daphne oil was used. The pressure was measured by
tracking the SC transition of a very small indium plate
by AC susceptibility. The ﬁlling factor of the pressure
cell was maximized. The fraction of the muons stopping
in the sample was approximately 40 %.
The magnetic susceptibility was measured under pres-
sures up to 3.1 GPa by a SQUID magnetometer
(Quantum Design MPMS-XL). Pressures were gen-
erated using a diamond anvil cell (DAC) [28] ﬁlled
with Daphne oil which served as a pressure-transmitting
medium. The pressure at low temperatures was deter-
mined by detecting the pressure dependence of the SC
transition temperature of Pb.

0.155). The system LBCO-0.155 (x > 1/8) is a good
superconductor with a well deﬁned SC transition, and ex-
hibits charge order as shown by x-ray and neutron diﬀrac-
tion experiments [25]. Here, we show that LBCO-0.155
also exhibits static spin-stripe order. Remarkably, both
static magnetism and superconductivity set in at approx-
imately the same temperature Tso (cid:39) Tc = 30.5 (5) K at
ambient pressure. Moreover, both Tc and Tso exhibit the
similar pressure dependence, i.e. Tc(p) (cid:39) Tso(p), which
is an interesting ﬁnding. The observed pressure indepen-
dent SC volume fraction of LBCO-0.155, together with
the antagonistic pressure dependence of the magnetic vol-
ume fraction Vm and the superﬂuid density ρs suggest
frustrated phase separation between the SC and magnetic
ground states, leading to a phase that is inhomogeneous
on an intermediate length scale. The observed phase sep-
aration and the simultaneous appearance of static mag-
netism and superconductivity at all pressures indicate
that static order and SC pairing correlations develop in
a cooperative fashion in LBCO-0.155, forming a spatially
self-organised pattern. Thus, the concept of intertwined
order may be relevant for the interpretation of these re-
sults.

Here, Vm denotes the relative volume of the magnetic

characteristic for an incommensurate spin density wave
and has been observed in cuprates with static spin stripe
order [31]. λnm is the relaxation rate of the nonmagnetic
part of the sample. The total initial assymetry Atot =
AS(0) + APC(0) (cid:39) 0.285 is a temperature independent
constant. A typical fraction of muons stopped in the
sample was AS(0)/Atot (cid:39) 0.40(3) which was assumed to
be temperature independent in the analysis. The µSR
time spectra were analyzed using the free software pack-
age MUSRFIT [29].

RESULTS

High pressure magnetic susceptibility data

Figure 1 shows the temperature dependence of the
zero-ﬁeld-cooled (ZFC) magnetic susceptibility χZFC for
LBCO-0.155 recorded in a magnetic ﬁeld of µ0H = 0.5
mT for selected hydrostatic pressures after substraction
of the background signal from the empty pressure cell.
At ambient pressure superconductivity sets in at Tc =
30.5 (5) K (Appendix A and Fig. 7). With increasing
pressure Tc increases with 3 K/GPa up to p (cid:39) 1.5 GPa
where it reaches Tc = 35(1) K, then it stays constant up
to p = 2.2 GPa. For p > 2.2 GPa, Tc has the tendency to
decrease up to the highest pressure of p = 3.1 GPa (see
the inset of Fig. 1). The pressure dependence of Tc is
displayed in Fig. 2 and will be discussed later. The mag-
nitude of χZFC at the base temperature (T = 5 K) is also
enhanced with applied pressure (see Fig. 1) from |χZFC|
= 0.45(5) at p = 0 GPa to the saturated value |χZFC| =
0.65(5) at p (cid:39) 1 GPa. It was found that χZFC(5 K) scales
with λ−2(T = 0) (λ is the magnetic penetration depth) as
determined from transverse ﬁeld µSR experiments (Fig-
ure 8). According to the Shoenberg model [30], χZFC
in a granular sample is expected to scale with λ−2 due
to the penetration of the magnetic ﬁeld on a distance λ
from the surface of each individual grain. By comparing
the experimental data to the Schoenberg model [30] we
conclude that the increase of |χZFC| is solely caused by
an increase of λ−2. This also explains why |χZFC| < 1
at all applied pressures, indicating that the SC volume
fraction in LBCO-0.155 is pressure independent. More-
over, it is not possible to extract an absolute value for the

the data by means of Eq. (1).

Analysis of ZF-µSR data

A substantial fraction of the µSR asymmetry originates
from muons stopping in the MP35N pressure cell sur-
rounding the sample. Therefore, the µSR data in the
whole temperature range were analyzed by decomposing
the signal into a contribution of the sample and a contri-
bution of the pressure cell:

A(t) = AS(0)PS(t) + AP C(0)PP C(t),

(1)

where AS(0) and AP C(0) are the initial asymmetries and
PS(t) and PP C(t) are the muon-spin polarizations be-
longing to the sample and the pressure cell, respectively.
The pressure cell signal was analyzed by a damped Kubo-
Toyabe function [26]. The response of the sample consists

Static magnetism as a function of pressure

Figures 3a and b show representative ZF µSR
time spectra for a polycrystalline LBCO-0.155 sample,
recorded at 5 K at ambient and at selected hydrostatic
pressures up to p = 2.2 GPa. For ambient pressure the
ZF µSR time spectrum taken at 40 K is also shown in
Fig. 3a. At T = 40 K, no muon spin precession, but
only a very weak depolarization of the µSR signal is ob-
served (see Fig. 3a). This weak depolarization and its
Gaussian functional form are typical for a paramagnetic
material and reﬂect the occurrence of a small Gaussian

Kubo-Toyabe depolarization, originating from the inter-
action of the muon spin with randomly oriented nuclear
magnetic moments. At T ≈ 5 K damped oscillations due
to muon-spin precession in internal magnetic ﬁelds are
observed at pressures up to p = 0.67 GPa. The µSR
time spectra are well described by a zeroth-order Bessel
function which is characteristic for an incommensurate
spin density wave, suggesting the presence of long-range
static spin-stripe order in LBCO-0.155 [9, 31] up to p
= 0.67 GPa. The oscillation frequency is nearly pres-
sure independent. On the other hand, for p ≤ 0.67 GPa
the amplitude of this oscillation gradually decreases with
increasing pressure, indicating a reduction of the mag-
netic volume fraction under pressure.
In the pressure
range 0.83 GPa ≤ p ≤ 2.2 GPa, instead of the oscilla-
tory behavior seen in the spin-ordered state for p ≤ 0.67
GPa, a rapidly depolarizing ZF-µSR time spectrum is
observed (see Fig. 3b). For clarity, Fig. 3b shows ZF-
µSR time spectra after subtraction of the pressure cell
signal from the total one (Appendix B and Fig. 9). One
can clearly see a rapidly depolarizing component visible
at early times (≤ 0.25 µs) of the spectra, while the non-
magnetic part of the sample gives rise a slow relaxation
component, apparent at longer times (> 0.25 µs). The
fast depolarization of the µSR signal (with no trace of an
oscillation) could be either due to a broad distribution of
static ﬁelds, and/or to strongly ﬂuctuating magnetic mo-
ments. To discriminate between these two possibilities,
we have performed decoupling experiments in longitudi-
nal ﬁelds (Appendix C and Fig. 10). LF-µSR experi-
ments showed that at modest external ﬁelds between 25
and 50 mT (of the order of the internal quasistatic mag-
netic ﬁelds) the muon spins are fully decoupled from the
internal magnetic ﬁelds, demonstrating that the weak in-
ternal ﬁelds are static rather than dynamic, supporting
the quasi-static origin of the fast depolarization at pres-
sures above 0.83 GPa. The rapid exponential relaxation
of the ZF-µSR signal implies that the spread of the local
magnetic ﬁeld must be fairly large. A possible explana-
tion may be that the spatially inhomogeneous magnetic
state seen by µSR is strongly disordered. This means
that in LBCO-0.155 pressure causes a transition from the
long-range static spin-ordered to a strongly disordered
state at p ∼ 1 GPa.

Next, we present the pressure dependences of the mag-
netic volume fraction Vm and the static spin-stripe order
temperature Tso in LBCO-0.155, extracted from the ZF-
µSR data. Figures 4a and b show the temperature de-
pendence of Vm in the pressure range of 0 ≤ p ≤ 0.67
GPa (long-range spin-stripe ordered state) and 0.83 GPa
≤ p ≤ 2.2 GPa (disordered spin-stripe state), respec-
tively. Below Tso (cid:39) 30 K, Vm increases progressively
with decreasing temperature, and acquires nearly 50 %
at ambient pressure at the base temperature T = 2 K.
At low temperature Vm signiﬁcantly decreases with in-
creasing pressure, reaching about 12 % at 0.67 GPa (see

stripe state observed in the pressure range 0.83 GPa ≤ p
≤ 2.2 GPa exhibits a much weaker pressure dependence
and acquires about 15 % at T = 5 K (see Fig. 4b). It is
interesting to note that while Vm decreases with pressure,
the transition temperature to the magnetically ordered
state Tso increases upon pressure. In order to extract Tso
from µSR, TF-µSR experiments in weak transverse ﬁeld
were carried out. Figure 5 shows the TF-µSR asymmetry

signals the appear-
ance of magnetic order in the spin-stripe phase, where
the muon spins experience a local magnetic ﬁeld larger
than the applied magnetic ﬁeld. As a result, the fraction
of muons in the paramagnetic state decreases. The on-
set temperature Tso is deﬁned as the temperatures where
the linearly extrapolated low and high temperature data
points intersect (see Fig. 5), yielding Tso = 30(1) K at p
= 0 GPa. By applying pressure Tso ﬁrst increases with
increasing pressure, reaching Tso = 35(1) K at 1.65 GPa,
and then tends to saturate as shown in Fig. 2. Note that
Tc(p) (cid:39) Tso(p) at all applied pressures up to 2.2 GPa.
This is a remarkable ﬁnding.

The temperature dependence of the µSR relaxation
rate σsc was also measured in the vortex state of LBCO-
0.155 at various applied pressures (Appendix F). σsc is
proportional to the second moment of local magnetic ﬁeld
distribution present in the sample. Below Tc the relax-
ation rate σsc starts to increase from zero with decreasing
temperature due to the formation of the ﬂux-line lattice
(FLL) in the SC state (Fig. 13b). The µSR relaxation
rate σsc is the measure of the superﬂuid density ρs ac-
cording to the relation: σsc ∝ ρs ≡ ns/m∗, where ns is
the SC carrier density, and m∗ is the eﬀective mass of
the SC carriers.

DISCUSSION

In order to compare the inﬂuence of pressure on the
SC and magnetic properties of LBCO-0.155, the pressure
dependences of the magnetic transition temperature Tso,
the SC transition temperature Tc, and the magnetic vol-
ume fraction Vm as well as the µSR relaxation rate σsc
are plotted in Figs. 2 and 6a.

The most essential ﬁndings of the present work are the
following: 1) Tc and Tso have very similar values at all
applied pressures as shown in Fig. 2. Both increase up
to (cid:39) 35(1) K at p (cid:39) 1.5 GPa and are nearly constant at

higher pressures up to p (cid:39) 2.2 GPa. 2) Pressure causes a
transition from the long-range static spin-stripe ordered
(0 ≤ p ≤ 0.67 GPa) to a strongly disordered (p ≤ 0.83
GPa) spin-stripe state (see Fig. 6a). In view of recent
theoretical and experimental works [32], we interprete
the observed disordered state as evidence for glassy
spin-stripe order. While the absence of long-range stripe
order in the presence of disorder is inevitable in two
dimensions, a new possible glassy state, the so-called
spin-density-wave (SDW) glass state, has recently been
proposed [32].
In this SDW glass phase the spins are
frozen in time, but the phase of the SDW is randomly
disordered in space. The spins retain a common axis
along which they randomly point up or down (spin
nematic order).
In the present case, because pressure
does not aﬀect the impurity concentration, the high
pressure putative glassy state is most probably caused by
possible frustrated phase separation [33] between the SC
and magnetic ground states in LBCO-0.155, which will

experimental evidence of a similar pressure evolution of
the SC and the magnetic transition temperatures and
a pressure induced change of the magnetic state in the
stripe phase of cuprates.

Besides the above results, other interesting ﬁndings
evident from Figs. 2 and 6a include the strong increase
of the superﬂuid density ρs ∝ σsc under pressure and
the reduction of the magnetic volume fraction Vm
under pressure, despite the fact that Tso increases with
pressure. As shown in Fig. 6a, the low-temperature
(T = 5 K) value of σsc ∝ ρs increases with increasing
pressure and reaches a constant value at p (cid:39) 1 GPa,
which is (cid:39) 35 % larger than the one at p = 0 GPa.
As already discussed above the SC volume fraction is
nearly constant under pressure. On the other hand
the magnetic volume fraction, Vm at T = 5 K sharply
decreases with pressure from (cid:39) 40 % at ambient pressure
to approximately 15 % at p = 0.83 GPa. For p > 0.83
GPa in the disordered stripe state Vm remains nearly
constant. While below p (cid:39) 0.83 GPa, antagonistic
pressure behavior between Vm and ρs is observed, above
p (cid:39) 0.83 GPa the disordered magnetic state coexists with
superconductivity with substantial superﬂuid density.
To further elucidate the interplay between Vm and ρs, it
is important to understand the origin for the pressure
enhancement of ρs. The Uemura relation in HTSs
reﬂects a remarkable correlation between Tc and the
zero-temperature µSR relaxation rate σSC(0) ∝ 1/λ2(0)
for cuprate HTSs [34]. This relation Tc vs. σ(0) which
seems to be generic for various families of cuprate HTSs
has the following features: In the underdoped regime Tc
∝ σ(0) (Uemura line) (see Fig. 6b). At higher doping Tc
saturates and becomes independent of σ(0), and ﬁnally
in the heavily overdoped regime Tc is suppressed. The
initial linear form of the Uemura relation indicates that
for these unconventional HTSs the ratio Tc/EF (EF
is the Fermi energy) is up to two orders of magnitude
larger than for conventional BCS superconductors. The
Uemura relation for the present µSR pressure data of
LBCO-0.155 are shown in Fig. 6b. As indicated by the
red solid line the slope Sp = (δTc/δP )/(δσsc(0)/δP ) is
a factor of (cid:39) 2 smaller than that expected from the
Uemura line [34] with SU = (δ Tc/δP )/(δσsc(0)/δP )
(cid:39) 40 K/µs. A similar substantial deviation from the
Uemura line was also observed in previous pressure
studies of YBa2Cu3O7 [35] and YBa2Cu4O8 [36, 37] as
well as in oxygen-isotope eﬀect studies of various cuprate
superconductors [38]. A slope which is a factor two
smaller than that of the Uemura line implies that the
increase of the superﬂuid density ρs(0) ∝ σ(0) is caused
not only by an increase of the SC carrier density ns,
but very likely also by a decrease of the eﬀective mass
m∗ of the SC carriers. This result together with the ob-
served bulk superconductivity detected by high pressure

susceptibility measurements and the simultaneous onset
of magnetism and superconductivity in LBCO-0.155 is
diﬃcult to explain in terms of a macroscopically phase
separated scenario of regions that are entirely SC and
others that are entirely magnetic [39]. To reconcile
the present results one may assume that the system
organizes itself so as to minimize the overlap between
magnetic and superconducting order parameters by
intertwining with each other. This is consistent with the
concept of a spatially modulated SC (PDW) state which
may avoid the amplitude-modulated antiferromagnetic
spin correlations by intertwining with them [17–19].
Within the scenario of the intertwined orders one may
understand that Tc(p) (cid:39) Tso(p) and the coexistence of
the high-pressure magnetic disordered stripe state and
bulk superconductivity. Moreover,
it also shares the
concept of phase separation, but on a short length scale.
The frustrated phase separation between the SC and
the long-range magnetic ground states in LBCO-0.155
leading to a state that is inhomogeneous on an interme-
diate length scale would be a possible explanation for
the antagonistic pressure behaviour between Vm and ρs.
This also means that the two coexisting phases are in
microscopic proximity to each other.

Furthermore, one should note the diﬀerences and sim-
ilarities between the pressure eﬀects observed in the
present system LBCO-0.155 and in LBCO-1/8 [24]:

1) At ambient pressure in LBCO-0.155, a well deﬁned
bulk SC transition with Tc = 30.5 (50) K takes place,
while in pollycrystaline LBCO-1/8 two SC transitions
were observed [24, 40]. The ﬁrst transition appears at
Tc1 (cid:39) 30 K, interpreted as the development of 2D super-
conductivity in the CuO2 planes. The second transition,
observed at Tc2 (cid:39) 5 K, corresponds to the transition to
a 3D SC phase.
2) In the case of LBCO-0.155 positive and strong pres-
sure eﬀects on both Tc and Tso with Tc(p) (cid:39) Tso(p) are
present. By contrast, in LBCO-1/8 the pressure eﬀect
on Tso is negative up to p (cid:39) 1.5 GPa and above it be-
comes positive. On the other hand, the pressure eﬀects
of Tc1 and Tc2 are positive for the whole pressure range
investigated. The values of Tso and Tc1,2 are also quite
diﬀerent for all applied p.

3) The magnetic volume fraction Vm(0) is strongly
reduced under pressure in both LBCO-0.155 and LBCO-
1/8. However,
in the latter system a simultaneous
increase of the SC volume fraction Vsc(0) is observed.
However, in LBCO-0.155 Vsc(0) is pressure independent,
suggesting bulk superconductivity in the entire sample
volume at all p. Most of the experimental facts listedq
above point
to substantial diﬀerences between the
pressure eﬀects of LBCO-1/8 and LBCO-0.155 with x
far away from 1/8.

To understand these diﬀerences between LBCO-1/8

CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, magnetism and superconductivity were
studied in LBCO-0.155 by means of magnetization and
µSR experiments as a function of pressure up to p (cid:39)
3.1 GPa.
It was found that in this system at ambient
pressure both long-range static magnetism and supercon-
ductivity sets in at approximately the same temperature
Tso (cid:39) Tc = 30.5 (5) K. Antagonistic pressure behaviour
between the magnetic volume fraction Vm and the su-
perﬂuid density ρs was observed in LBCO-0.155 under
pressure up to p (cid:39) 0.83 GPa, which was interpreted in
terms of a frustrated phase separation scenario. Interest-
ingly, above p (cid:39) 0.83 GPa, where ρs acquires a constant
value, the long-range static spin-stripe order is not sup-
pressed, but is replaced by a disordered quasi-static mag-
netic state, which persists up to the highest applied pres-
sure. Even more importantly, Tc and Tso have very sim-
ilar values at all pressures, indicating the simultaneous
appearance of static magnetic order and superconductiv-
ity at all applied pressures in LBCO-0.155. The present
ﬁndings provide clear experimental evidence of a pressure
induced change of the magnetic state as well as the same
pressure evolution of the SC and the magnetic transition
temperatures in the stripe phase of cuprates. The com-
bined experimental results of the observed phase separa-
tion between the magnetic and the SC ground states, the
presence of a robust magnetic state in the high pressure
SC state with a substantial superﬂuid density, and the
very similar values for Tso(p) and Tc(p) strongly suggests
that static magnetic order and SC pairing correlations
develop in a cooperative fashion in LBCO-0.155.

and LBCO-0.155, pressure eﬀects on the structural prop-
erties of these systems are crucial. Note that already at
ambient pressure the structural properties of these two
systems are quite diﬀerent. While in LBCO-1/8 a discon-
tinuous transition from a low-temperature orthorhombic
(LTO) to a low-temperature tetragonal (LTT) phase is
observed [8, 41], LBCO-0.155 shows a transition from the
LTO to the so called low-temperature less orthorhom-
bic (LTLO) phase [8]. Diﬀerent structural properties of
these two systems may be one of the possible reasons
for the diﬀerences in the observed pressure eﬀects. This
is supported by the above mentioned experimental fact
that the sign of the pressure eﬀect on Tso in LBCO-1/8
changes from negative to positive at p (cid:39) 1.5 GPa, above
which the LTT structural phase is suppressed [25].

without the pressure cell

Figure 7 shows the temperature dependence of the
zero-ﬁeld cooled susceptibility χZFC and the magnetic
volume fraction Vm extracted from the µSR data for pol-
lycrystalline LBCO-0.155 without pressure cell. Remark-
ably, both magnetism and superconductivity sets in at
approximately the same temperature Tso (cid:39) Tc = 29.5
(5) K.

As shown in Fig. 8, χZFC(5 K) increases with increas-
ing pressure and scales with the µSR relaxation rate
σsc(T = 0) ∼ λ−2 obtained from TF µSR experiments
(λ is the magnetic penetration depth). This ﬁnding is a
characteristic feature of the so-called Schoenberg method
[30]. This method describes the measurement of the dia-
magnetic Meissner fraction χZFC of a powder of SC par-
ticles whose size is less than or equal to the penetration
depth λ. In this limit London [42] calculated for a sphere
of radius r made of isotropic material χ = r2/15λ2 ∼
λ−2. This implies that the increase of χZFC under pres-
sure is solely caused by an increase of σsc (see Fig. 8).
Consequently, the SC volume fraction in LBCO-0.155 is
pressure independent.

GPa, a rapidly depolarizing ZF-µSR signal is observed
(see Fig. 9a). It is diﬃcult to see the signal with weak
exponential depolarization due to the substantial signal
coming from the pressure cell (see Fig. 9b). For clarity,
we subtract the pressure cell signal from the total one for
p = 0.83 GPa and plot the resulting sample signal in the
inset of Fig. 9b.

APPENDIX C: Longitudinal ﬁeld µSR experiments

in LBCO-0.155

To discriminate whether the fast depolarization of the
µSR signal A(T ), observed at pressures p > 0.83 GPa,
is due to a broad distribution of static ﬁelds, and/or
to strongly ﬂuctuating magnetic moments, we have per-
formed decoupling experiments in a longitudinal ﬁeld.
Figure 10a shows Atot(t) measured at 5 K and p =
0.83 GPa with diﬀerent magnetic ﬁelds applied along the
initial direction of the muon spin polarization. These
experiments showed that at modest external ﬁelds be-
tween 25 and 50 mT (of the order of the internal qua-
sistatic ﬁelds) the muon-spin relaxation is substantially
suppressed. This means that the muon spins are fully
decoupled from the internal magnetic ﬁelds, demonstrat-
ing that the weak internal ﬁelds are static rather than
dynamic, supporting the quasi-static origin of the fast
muon-spin depolarization for p > 0.83 GPa. Figure 10b
shows Atot(t) recorded in a longitudinal ﬁeld (LF) of 10
mT at various temperatures. It clearly shows that the
muon-spin relaxation increases below about 35 K, pro-
viding further evidence for quasi-static magnetic order
in LBCO-0.155 at pressures up to 2.2 GPa.

experiments at p = 0.6 GPa

A fundamental question to answer is how magnetism
and superconductivity may coexist within the stripe
phase and how they further evolve under an externally
applied pressure. Since the muon is a local probe, the
µSR signals from spatially diﬀerent areas of the sam-
ple are not averaged but superimposed in the measured
spectra. This feature allows to distinguish between the
following possible scenarios: The ﬁrst one is the so called
phase separation scenario. The phase separation can be
macroscopic according to which superconductivity devel-
ops just within the parts of the sample remaining non-
magnetic down to low temperatures [43–45]. Another
case of phase separation between the SC and the mag-
netic ground states is when the electronic inhomogenity
is on an intermediate length scale. This also means that
the two coexisting phases are in microscopic proximity
to each other. The second possibility is microscopic co-
existence of the superconducting and magnetic order pa-
rameters [46, 47]. The third possibility is a nanoscale
segregation into magnetic domains [48, 49]. Muons are
sensitive to dipolar ﬁelds at a distance of up to a few
lattice spacings, so if nanoscale magnetic domains exist
then the fraction of muons experiencing static local mag-
netic ﬁelds could be signiﬁcantly higher than the fraction
of Cu sites carrying an ordered moment. Thus, if we have
nanoscale segregation we would see nearly full magnetic
and SC volumes, which is not the case for the investi-
gated system LBCO-0.155, excluding this possibility. As

spectrum. ZF-µSR time spectra A(t) obtained after cooling
the sample of LBCO-0.155 in zero magnetic ﬁeld from 50 K

discussed above, the ZF-µSR response of the magnetic
areas of the sample is characterized by a fast relaxing
signal visible at early times of the spectra, while a non-
magnetic volume shows slow relaxation, better visible at
longer times. In Fig. 11 two ZF-µSR time spectra taken
at the same temperature (T = 5 K) and pressure (p = 0.6
GPa) with diﬀerent magnetic histories are shown. The
ﬁrst µSR time spectrum was recorded after cooling the
sample from T (cid:39) 50 K to 5 K in zero magnetic ﬁeld.
The second ZF spectrum was obtained at constant tem-
perature after ramping the magnetic ﬁeld up to µ0H (cid:39)
30 mT and then setting it back to zero. The ZF-µSR
signal representing the non-magnetic volume of the sam-
ple exhibits a larger relaxation after the application of
an external ﬁeld at low temperatures (see Fig. 11). The
ZF-µSR response of the magnetic areas of the sample, as
evidenced by fast relaxations at early times of the spec-
trum, is also aﬀected by the magnetic history. However,
this eﬀect is less pronounced as compared to the one on
the non-magnetic part of the signal. Magnetic history de-
pendent magnetic and non-magnetic parts of the ZF-µSR
signal indicate that the superconducting and magnetic
ground states are phase seperated and that they are in
microscopic proximity to each other. Via the proximity
eﬀect a modicum of SC order will be induced in the mag-
netic regions. Any changes of the magnetic ﬁeld within
a superconductor with non-zero pinning leads to trap-
ping of magnetic ﬂux and, as a consequence, to a very
nonuniform ﬁeld distribution inside the superconducting
parts of the sample, giving rise to the history dependent
ZF-µSR signals presented above.

APPENDIX F: Probing the vortex state in

LBCO-0.155 as a function of pressure

Figure 12a exhibits transverse-ﬁeld (TF) µSR-time
spectra for LBCO-0.155, measured at the maximum ap-
plied pressure p = 2.2 GPa. Spectra above (45 K) and
below (5 K) the SC transition temperature Tc are shown.
Above Tc the oscillations show a small relaxation due to
the random local ﬁelds from the nuclear magnetic mo-
ments. Below Tc the relaxation rate strongly increases
with decreasing temperature due to the presence of a
nonuniform local magnetic ﬁeld distribution as a result
of the formation of a ﬂux-line lattice (FLL) in the SC
state. Figure 12b shows the Fourier transforms (FT) of
the µSR time spectra shown in Figs. 12a. At T = 5
K the narrow signal around µ0Hext = 10 mT originates
from the pressure cell, while the broad signal with a ﬁrst
moment µ0Hint < µ0Hext, marked by the orange solid
arrow in Fig. 12b, arises from the SC sample.

The TF µSR data were analyzed by using the following

012340.00.10.20.3ZFCZFC ﬁ 30 mT ﬁ ZF A (t)t (ms)La1.845Ba0.155CuO4T = 5 K, p = 0.35 GPa11
of the sample, respectively. γ/(2π) (cid:39) 135.5 MHz/T is
the muon gyromagnetic ratio, ϕ is the initial phase of
the muon-spin ensemble. Bint,s and Bint,pc represent the
local magnetic ﬁelds, probed by the muons, stopped in
the sample and the pressure cell, respectively. The re-
laxation rates σsc and σnm characterize the damping due
to the formation of the vortex lattice in the SC state
and of the nuclear magnetic dipolar contribution, respec-
tively. In the analysis σnm was assumed to be constant
over the entire temperature range and was ﬁxed to the
value obtained above Tc, where only nuclear magnetic
moments contribute to the µSR relaxation rate σ. The
Gaussian relaxation rate σpc reﬂects the depolarization
due to the nuclear magnetism of the pressure cell. It can
be seen from the FTs shown in Fig. 12b that the width
of the pressure cell signal slightly increases below Tc. As
shown previously [35], this is due to the inﬂuence of the
diamagnetic moment of the SC sample on the pressure
cell, leading to a temperature dependent σpc below Tc.
In order to consider this inﬂuence, we assume a linear
coupling between σpc and the ﬁeld shift of the internal
magnetic ﬁeld in the SC state: σpc(T ) = σpc(T > Tc) +
C(T )(µ0Hint,NS - µ0Hint,SC), where σpc(T > Tc) = 0.35
µs−1 is the temperature independent Gaussian relaxation
rate. µ0Hint,NS and µ0Hint,SC are the internal magnetic
ﬁelds measured in the normal and in the SC state, respec-
tively. As indicated by the solid lines in Figs. 12a and b,
the µSR time spectra are well described by Eq. (6). The
solid lines in panel (b) are the FTs of the ﬁtted curves
shown in Fig. 12a. The model used describes the data
rather well.

Below Tc a large diamagnetic shift of µ0Hint expe-
rienced by the muons is observed at all applied pres-
sures. This is evident in Fig. 13a where we plot the tem-
perature dependence of the diamagnetic shift ∆Bdia =
µ0[Hint,SC-Hint,NS] for LBCO-0.155 at various pressures,
where µ0Hint,SC denotes the internal ﬁeld measured in
the SC state and µ0Hint,NS the internal ﬁeld measured
in the normal state at 45 K. Note that µ0Hint,NS is tem-
perature independent. The SC transition temperature Tc
is determined from the intercept of the linearly extrap-
olated ∆Bdia curve and its zero line (we used the same
criterium for the determination of Tc from ∆Bdia(T ) as
from the susceptibility data χZFC(T ), presented in the
main text), yielding Tc = 28.3 (5) K for p = 0 GPa. This
value of Tc is in fair agreement with Tc = 30.5(9) K ob-
tained from the susceptibility data presented in the main
text. With increasing pressure Tc increases and reaches
Tc (cid:39) 35 K at p = 1.07 GPa. Above p = 1.07 GPa Tc seems
to saturate, which is in perfect agreement with the high-
pressure magnetization data (see Fig. 2). Application of
pressure causes an enhancement of the diamagnetic shift,
which reaches it‘s saturation value above p = 1.07 GPa.
The temperature dependence of the µSR relaxation
rate σsc of LBCO-0.155 in the SC state at selected pres-
sures is shown in Fig. 13b. The µSR relaxation rate σsc is

(Fig. 14a) takes place at the same applied pressure p (cid:39)

tions on σsc is still possible. Thus, we refrain here from

In Fig. 14b the asymmetries As,sc and As,m, which are
proportional to the SC and the magnetic fractions of the

An increase of As,sc and a simultaneous decrease of As,m
are observed upon increasing the pressure to p = 1.07
GPa. However, above both saturates. This is in excel-
lent agreement with observed pressure dependence of the
diamagnetic moment, obtained from the magnetization
experiments (see Fig. 8) and the magnetic volume frac-
tion, extracted from the ZF-µSR experiments (see Fig.
6a).
