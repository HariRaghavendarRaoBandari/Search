Abstract. Lemaˆıtre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) solutions have traditionally been conﬁned
to systems with no pressure in which the gravity is due to massive dust, but the
solutions are little changed in form if, as in cosmology, the pressure is uniform in
space at each comoving time. This allows the equations of cosmology to be deduced
in a manner that more closely resembles classical mechanics.
It also gives some
inhomogeneous solutions with growing condensations and black holes. We give criteria
by which the sizes of diﬀerent closed models of the universe can be compared and
discuss conditions for self-closure of inhomogeneous cosmologies with a Λ-term.

Pressure in LTB cosmologies

1. Introduction

2

Oppenheimer and Snyder [1] found the solution for a uniform cold sphere collapsing
under gravity to form a black hole. More general solutions that can make black holes
are contained in the Lemaˆıtre-Tolman-Bondi metrics [2, 3, 4].

[7]), the appearance of naked singularities (e.g.

The LTB spherically symmetric, non-static solutions of Einstein’s equations have
been widely used to investigate the formation of the Cauchy, apparent and event horizons
around black holes (see, e.g., [5, 6]), the formation of black-hole singularities in regions
devoid of matter (e.g.
[8, 9]), and
the subtle analysis of shell-crossing and shell-focusing singularities (e.g. [10, 11]). LTB
models have also played an important role in cosmology as exact inhomogeneous models,
supplying the framework to study the formation of structures as clusters of galaxies,
galaxies and voids within exact non-linear general relativity [12] and generalising,
for spherical symmetry, more astrophysical papers on evolution of structures in the
Einstein – de Sitter universe (see, e.g., [13, 14]). Most recently, the LTB models were
used to illustrate numerically the occurrence of permanent matter density spikes [15].

The popularity of the LTB cosmologies increased after the discovery of the
accelerated expansion when a possibility appeared that one does not need to evoke
the concept of dark energy if we live in an inhomogeneous universe (e.g. [16]). However,
it appears that simple LTB models are ruled out as an explanation of dark energy
when several observational eﬀects are considered simultaneously (see [17], p. 411 and
references therein).

Above we pointed out some important papers showing the role of the LTB solutions,
there are also excellent textbooks and monographs available in which the detailed
analysis of the LTB models is given and many other references are listed, see [17] –
[20]. In most of that work it is assumed that the pressure is zero. The ﬂuid particles
then move along time-like geodesics and the equations for dust become very close to
their counterparts in classical mechanics. However, the importance of the pressure
of the black body radiation at large redshifts has lessened enthusiasm for the LTB
derivation of the cosmological equations themselves because of this lack of pressure. In
his famous work [2] Lemaˆıtre, in contrast to Tolman [3] and Bondi [4], did consider the
Einstein equations for spherically symmetric, non-stationary, and inhomogeneous ﬂuids
with pressure. So, for example, the equation (10) below relating the time derivative
of mass to the radial pressure is contained in [2] (cf. Eq. 3.4). Within the explicit
solutions Lemaˆıtre considers pressure in a quasi-static situation, and in the case of the
homogeneous static sphere — the so-called Eddington problem‡.

More recently, an interesting generalization of the LTB models to include tangential
pressures but without each sphere pressing on the next were given by Gair [22, 23].
The tangential pressure is provided by angular momentum which may diﬀer from

‡ Krasi´nski [21] explains just how fundamental Lemaˆıtre’s contribution [2] is: the mass for spherically
symmetric ﬂuids (now called Misner-Sharp mass) is introduced, an anisotropic pressure is admitted,
and an attempt is made to explain formation of structures by an exact model.

shell to shell.
In the null limit these models generalize the Vaidya metric [24]. The
generalized LTB models including pressure were analyzed by using the ADM formalism
in [25, 26]. The exterior vacuum (Schwarzschild) spacetime described in generalized
Painlev´e-Gullstrand coordinates can be joined to the interior LTB region in a single
coordinate system. However, no dynamical solution with pressure was constructed.
S¨ussmann and collaborators [27, 28] considered a mixture of matter and radiation,
ρrad = 3p/c2. They gave some solutions of interest, but their form of metric in comoving
coordinates omits the gravitational eﬀects of spatial pressure gradients when compared
with the Landau and Lifshitz equations given below. However, the pressure gradients
are exactly balanced by the divergence of an appropriately chosen anisotropic pressure.
Their work was recently employed [29] to illustrate the results on the existence and
stability of shells separating expanding and collapsing regions in the LTB models with
anisotropic pressures.

Our aims in this paper are ﬁrstly to derive the equations of homogeneous cosmology
including pressure from the LTB approach. This shows how naturally Hoyle’s continuous
creation or inﬂation ﬁt into cosmology. It also demonstrates how closely those equations
resemble bound and unbound motion in spherical Newtonian dynamics and illustrate the
gravitational eﬀect of internal energy. Secondly we show how such eﬀects change typical
LTB pressureless solutions which we give as examples. Thirdly we consider criteria for
the spatial closure of cosmological models due to their own curvature and apply them
to spherical models. These are contrasted with conditions for bound motion.

2. Field equations and characteristic radii for LTB models with pressure

Following Landau and Lifshitz Classical Theory of ﬁelds p. 364, problem 4, with small
changes in notation, we write the metric as

ds2 = e−2ψc2 dt2 − e2λdχ2 − [r(χ, t)]2 d ˆr2,

(1)

where χ is a comoving coordinate that labels the diﬀerent spheres whose areas are
4π[r(χ, t)]2 at time t and ˆr is the unit Cartesian radial vector. Once any particular pole
for spherical polar coordinates is chosen we can express dˆr2 = dθ2 + sin2 θdφ2. Both ψ
and λ are functions of χ and t. We denote ∂/∂(ct) by a dot and ∂/∂χ by a prime. The
Einstein equations read (κ = 8πG/c4):

− κT 1
−κT 0
−κT 1

1 = κp = e−2λ(cid:2)(r′/r)2 − 2ψ′r′/r(cid:3) − e2ψ(2¨r/r + ˙r2/r2 + 2 ˙ψ ˙r/r) − 1/r2,
(2)
0 = −κρc2 = e−2λ(2r′′/r + r′2/r2 − 2λ′r′/r) − e2ψ(2 ˙λ ˙r/r + ˙r2/r2) − 1/r2, (3)
0 = 0 = 2e−2λ(− ˙r′/r + ˙λr′/r − ψ′ ˙r/r).
(4)

As yet the pressure p (χ, t) and the energy density ρ (χ, t) are general. In particular they
include contributions from any cosmological constant so p = pm−Λ/κ, c2ρ = c2ρm +Λ/κ
where the material has pressure and density pm, ρm. The conservation laws come from
the contracted Bianchi identities Dµ(T µ

ν ) = 0 which give

2 ˙λ + 4 ˙r/r = −2 ˙ρc2/(p + ρc2) ,

ψ′ = p′/(p + ρc2) .

(5)

Pressure in LTB cosmologies

The other components of Einstein’s equations give nothing new. The second of
equations (5) shows that if p is independent of χ then ψ is independent too. Then e−2ψ
is a function of t and we may deﬁne a new time τ such that dτ = e−ψcdt. The equations
are unchanged provided we put ψ = 0 and reinterpret a dot as ∂/∂τ . Equation (4)
reduces to ∂λ/∂τ = ∂(ln r′)/∂τ , so on integration dt we ﬁnd

e2λ = r′2/(1 + 2ε(χ)) ,

(6)

where the denominator is the integration ’constant’ which is a function of χ alone. ε
turns out to be the energy per unit mc2 of the shell labelled χ. Inserting this e2λ into
equation (2) and remembering that ψ = 0,

− κp = −2ε(χ)/r2 + (2¨r/r + ˙r2/r2) .

(7)

But ∂(r ˙r2)/∂τ = 2r ˙r¨r + ˙r3, so multiplying by 1
we obtain

2 r2 ˙r, integrating dτ and deﬁning MT , M,

2r ˙r2 = −Z τ
− εr + 1
MT (χ, τ ) = −Z τ

4πr2pm(τ )c−2 ˙rdτ,

where the integral is performed at constant χ i.e. over the past history of the shell
labelled χ and includes the integration ’constant’ which will depend on χ. We shall
later justify this notation by showing that MT is the total gravitating mass including
the contribution from dark energy. Notice that if MT is initially zero then all of it
is generated by negative pressure as in Hoyle’s continuous creation and in inﬂation.
Dividing by r and re-ordering the terms, we ﬁnd an equation with remarkable similarity
to the classical energy per unit mass of the shell labelled χ:

1

2 ˙r2 − GM(χ, τ )/(c2r) − Λr2/6 = ε(χ) ,
∂MT /∂τ = −4πp(τ )c−2r2 ˙r ,

∂M/∂τ = −4πpm(τ )c−2r2 ˙r .

(10)

The last two equations are interpreted as the loss (or increase) of mass due to the work
done in the expansion of the sphere. We now return to equation (3) and eliminate λ
and its derivatives by using (6). The resulting equation involves ε(χ) and its derivative
but these may be eliminated by use of (10). After a cavalcade of cancellations (see
Appendix) we are left with the pleasing result

M ′ = 4πr2ρm(χ, τ )r′,

(11)

which justiﬁes our notation and the interpretation of MT above. However, it should
be realised that this M is not the sum of the c−2 times the energy densities within
the sphere, because the element of volume is not 4πr2dr (except in the ﬂat case).
Indeed M contains a negative contribution from the gravitational binding energy. We
are used to the condition ε < 0 as being the condition for bound motion but this
is no longer true in the presence of the Λ-term. Rather the condition ˙r = 0 occurs
when ε = − [(GM/c2)/r + Λr2/6]. When there is no pressure, M reduces to the
integration ’constant’ M(χ) and then the quantity in square brackets has a minimum

Pressure in LTB cosmologies

at r = (3GM/c2Λ)1/3, so the motion will be bound if ε < −(3/2) [(GM/c2)2Λ/3]1/3. For
positive material pressure M is not constant (it decreases as the system expands); still
this same criterion for bound motion can be used provided M is interpreted as the M
at the time when ˙r2 has a minimum. Incorporating the value of eλ found above, the
metric now reads

ds2 = dτ 2 −

r′2dχ2

[1 + 2ε(χ)] − r2 d ˆr2.

(12)

In considering spatially closed models we show below that there will be a radius at
which r′ = 0; and by analogy with the homogeneous cosmological solutions we say that
the universe at such points is half-closed. To avoid a metric singularity there, this must
occur where ε(χ) = − 1
2 . But since ε is a function of χ alone, such a comoving sphere
has ε = − 1
2 for all time and to avoid metric singularities r′ has to remain zero on this
comoving sphere. We now ask how this spherical shell with ε = − 1
2 moves. If it emerges
from the Big Bang it may gravitationally decelerate suﬃciently for the expansion to cease
before the Λ-term starts accelerating it again§. In such a case its ˙r will become zero so
from equation (10) this will occur when M is related to r by GM/c2 = − 1
2 r. We
may characterise the extent of such solutions by the maximum radius that the ε = − 1
2
sphere reaches, or alternatively by the gravitating mass Massociated with that sphere
as it reaches that extent. There will also be solutions that collapse from inﬁnity and
bounce on the repulsion of the Λ-term and then expand to inﬁnity. For them there will
be a characteristic minimum radius and an associated gravitating mass. However, a
third class of spatially closed solutions start from the Big Bang and expand for ever.
For them there is no turning point, but they start decelerating after the Big Bang under
the inﬂuence of gravity but, before they reverse, the eﬀect of the Λ-term re-accelerates
them. There will be a time and a radius at which the ε = − 1
2 sphere has no acceleration.
At that moment we see from equation (7) that (−κpm + Λ)r2 = 1 + ˙r2. But combining
this with (10) for ˙r2 we ﬁnd

6 Λr3 + 1

r3 =

3GM/c2
Λ − 3κpm/2

.

(13)

Here M(χ, τ ) is to be evaluated for the χ at which ε = − 1
2 and with pm at the moment
at which that sphere has no acceleration. For a universe like ours pm was negligible at
this time as compared with Λ so the above equation eﬀectively relates the characteristic
gravitating mass to the characteristic radius.

If the metric describes a self-closed system, then there must be one point (or an
uneven number of points) where r′ = 0. To avoid singularities in the metric we need
ε(χ) = − 1
2 there. We shall label the (lowest) value of χ at which this happens χ1,
so ε(χ1) = − 1
It would be possible to have a closed system in which beyond χ1
2 .
the system is symmetrical with r(χ1 + ∆χ, τ ) = r(χ1 − ∆χ, τ ) with both ε(χ) and
M(χ, τ ) symmetrical about χ1. Notice that M ′ = 0 at χ1, but increases up to there and

§ Surprisingly, larger mass be it due to radiation or rest mass helps rather then hinders escape to
inﬁnity. This is because larger masses at ﬁxed ε emerge from the Big Bang with greater ˙r2.

thereafter M starts to decrease as χ increases past χ1. This decrease of the gravitating
mass of material within a sphere as χ is increased beyond χ1 can be interpreted as due
to the increase in binding energy exceeding the increase in rest energy from the addition
of another shell of matter.

3. The equations of homogeneous cosmology

We look for solutions of equations (10) and (13) in which the radius of any sphere at
any time is just a re-scaled model of the behaviour of any other sphere at that time.
Thus we look for solutions of the form r = a(τ )f (χ). Notice that replacing a by a/L
and f by Lf , with L constant, does not change r and furthermore that we are still free
to choose our labelling f of the diﬀerent spherical shells. Inserting this form into (10)
divided by f 2, and into (11), we get

From here we deduce that M = µ(τ )f 3 and 2ε = −Kf 2 with K constant and

6 Λa2 = [GM(χ, τ )/(af c2) + ε(χ)] /f 2,

3 4πa3ρm ,

µ = 1
˙a2/a2 − Λ/3 = 8πGρm/(3c2) − K/a2 ,

˙µ = −4πa2 ˙apm(τ )/c2 ,

(14)

(15)

(16)

(17)

from which we see that ρm has to be a function of τ only. Cosmologists often use the
freedom to choose L described above to rescale a so that for |K| > 0 the old |K|/a2
becomes the new 1/a2. Thus eﬀectively we may take K = k = ±1, 0. Putting the form
for r and ε into (7),

Λ − κpm = k/a2 + (2¨a/a + ˙a2/a2) .

Equations (16) and (17) are the standard cosmological equations and the metric now
has g11 = −a2f ′2/(1− kf 2). For k = +1 we may now choose the labelling of our spheres
to be f (χ) = sin χ, and f = sinh χ for k = −1, and f = χ for k = 0. With these the
metric is

ds2 = dτ 2 − a2(cid:2)dχ2 + f 2 d ˆr2(cid:3) .

3.1. Cosmological solutions

(18)

Our solutions contain the cosmological constant explicitly, so our pressure term is only
pm(τ ), the matter pressure which is important during the relativistic/radiation era when
pm = 1
3ρmc2 ∝ a−4. We now concentrate on the special case of a radiation universe with a
Λ term since this gives an explicit solution. The more general cosmological solutions give
qualitatively similar results when cold dark matter and baryons are included. Equation
(16) then takes the form with σ, ˜σ, ˜k deﬁned below

a2 ˙a2 = 1

3 Λa4 − ka2 + σ = 1

˜k = 3k/(2Λ) ,

σ = 1

3 Λh(a2 − ˜k)2 + ˜k2(˜σ − 1)i = F (a2) ,

˜σ = 4σΛ/(3k2) .

3 κρmc2a4 = const ,

(19)

Pressure in LTB cosmologies

Notice that when ˜σ ≥ 1, ˙a is never zero, so the universe either expands for ever or
contracts for ever, but when ˜σ < 1 reversals will take place at positive a2. Putting T =
3 Λ τ , equation (19) integrates via the substitutions a2 − ˜k = ˜k√˜σ − 1 sinh χ, ˜σ > 1
2q 1
and a2 − ˜k = ˜k√1 − ˜σ, ˜σ < 1 to give

a2 = ˜k h1 ± √˜σ − 1 sinh(T − T0)i ,
= ˜k [1 + exp(±(T − T0))] ,
= ˜k h1 ± √1 − ˜σ cosh(T − T0)i ,
=p3σ/Λ sinh(T − T0),
= k (cid:2)σ − (τ − τ0)2(cid:3) ,
= 2√σ (τ − τ0) ,

(20)

˜σ > 1,

˜σ = 1 ,

˜σ < 1 ,

k = 0 ,
|k| > 0 , Λ = 0 ,
|k| = 0 , Λ = 0 .

By suitable choices of T0 it is possible to set T = 0 when a = 0 for most, but not all of
these solutions. Thus

√˜σ sinh T − 2 sinh2(T /2)i ,

a2 = ˜k h±
=p3σ/Λ sinh T,

where only positive solutions for a2 are allowed.

|˜σ − 1| > 0 ,
k = 0 ,

The nature of these solutions is best seen graphically. Figure 1 shows the graph of
a2 ˙a2 = F (a2) as a function of a2. It is drawn for ˜k > 0, ˜σ > 1, so that all positive values
of a are accessible with F > 0. When ˜σ < 1 the only change is that the horizontal axis
moves up to the level such as that of the dotted line, then only the two regions drawn
with a continuous line are accessible, so there are solutions between a = 0 and the ﬁrst
O-point which then return to the origin and also solutions between the second O-point
and inﬁnity. These solutions collapse from inﬁnity but bounce due to cosmic repulsion
at that O-point and then expand to inﬁnity. When ˜k ≤ 0, the minimum of F moves
3 Λ˜k2˜σ, which
to negative a2, so for real a, F increases with a2 and at the origin F = 1
is positive, so all positive values of a are accessible.
[A very similar graphical analysis
holds for the more general case that includes cold dark matter but there the analysis is
in terms of a rather than a2 to wit, ˙a2 = ˜F (a) = 1
3 8πGρdc−2a3)/a + k.]

3 Λ a2 + σa−2 + ( 1

When there is no Λ-term the solutions (20) become

a2 = kτ (cid:2)2√σ − τ(cid:3) ,

a2 = 2√στ ,

|k| > 0 ,
k = 0 ,

(21)

(22)

where we have chosen the expanding solutions and set a possible τ0 = 0. In the k = 0
solution the pressure pm ∝ τ −2 and this holds also for the other solutions when τ is
small.

4. General LTB solutions and global pressure eﬀects

In this section we give an example of an inhomogeneous pressureless closed LTB solution
that develops a black hole at the origin. We then consider its modiﬁcation when a Λ

term is included and ﬁnally the eﬀects of a homogeneous pressure.

A pretty example is given by setting x = M/MU = sin3 χ, where MU is the constant

gravitating mass of half the closed universe (i.e. that with χ ≤ π/2) and also taking

ε

χ ≤ π/2,
π/2 ≤ χ ≤ π .

(24)

We take 0 < α < 1 and notice that at χ = π/2, x = 1, H = 1. For general Λ and
pm = 0 we see from equation (10) that the radius of the sphere with gravitational
mass M/MU = x = sin3 χ at the ’time’ τ since the Big Bang is given via the integral

When Λ = 0 this can be exactly integrated and for ε < 0 it gives r(τ ) parametrically

in terms of parameter η:

τ =R dr/ ˙r =R r[2εr2 + 2GMc−2r + 1
r =(cid:2)GMc−2/(−ε)(cid:3) sin2 η ,
2πτ /τU = [2η − sin(2η)] H(x) ,

τU = 2πGMU c−2 .

(25)

(26)

For Λ = 0, τU is the ’time’ between the Big Bang and the Big Crunch but that is
not true for Λ not zero. A singularity forms at the origin where η = π at time
τ /τU ≥ C/(C + 1), C ≪ 1, and its mass grows almost self-similarly when x is in
the range C 1/α ≪ x/x1 ≪ 1. The constant x1 gives the mass at which the self-similar
growth of the singularity ceases. (A suitable special case is given by taking the constant
α = 1/2.) The universe becomes uniform again as χ increases towards π/2, where M
approaches MU , and it remains uniform in π/2 ≤ χ ≤ π. The elimination of η is easy

near the singularity and also near η = π/4, π/2. The mass, Ms, in the singularity at
time τ is given by setting η = π, so

H(xs) = τ /τU ,

xs = Ms/MU .

(27)

Approximating the expression for H above by [C + (x/x1)α] /(C + 1) we solve for the
mass in the singularity and ﬁnd

Ms = M1 [(C + 1)τ /τU ) − C]1/α ,
C/(C + 1) ≤ τ /τU ≪ 1 ,

M1 = x1MU ;

(28)

Ms grows proportionally to τ 1/α over the self-similar range indicated above. A black hole
forms around this singularity. No light can escape from the sphere of radius r = 2GM/c2,
so we use this rather than the asymptotic deﬁnition which for closed universe would give
the whole mass of the universe. When the singularity’s mass is small compared with
the mass of the universe, the black hole forms where the parameter η is near 2π and in
that region η is readily eliminated giving

Setting 2GMc−2/r = 1 we ﬁnd the mass of the black hole, Mb, is given by,

r =(cid:2)GMc−2/(−ε)(cid:3)(cid:2)(3π/2)(1 − H −1τ /τU )(cid:3)2/3 .
H(xb) − 2xb/(3π) = τ /τU ,

xb = Mb/MU .

(29)

(30)

Comparison with equation (27) shows that the black hole has a mass only a little more
than its central singularity; for example, for α = 1
2 and C 2 ≪ x/x1 ≪ 1, xs/x1 ≃
(τ /τU )2 then Mb/Ms ≃ [1 + 4τ

x1].

4.1. Eﬀect of cosmic repulsion

When the Λ-term is present the black hole formation is hardly aﬀected. The integral
for the time can be well approximated by setting Λr4/3 = Ar2 + Br in the region of the
turn-around radius r = r0 which is the relevant root of the cubic

(34)

The latter is proportional to r−1/2 and becomes minus one at the black hole. When
x ≫ x1 and when χ ≥ π/2, H = 1, and we ﬁnd that the density is uniform in space
but depends on time, to wit 8πGρm/c2 = 3(2GM/c2)−2 sin6 η with η related to time via
(26) with H = 1. In these regions the universe expands or contracts uniformly.

By contrast the Λ-term is really important when Λ > (3GMU /c2)−2 as there is
no turnaround radius for the ε = − 1

leaving behind the sphere with (−2ε)3/2 = 3GMc−2Λ1/2. All material with smaller M
eventually falls back into the black hole. Using equations (23) and (24) with C neglected,

4.2. The gravity of internal energy

To get equation (6) we took the pressure at each cosmic time to be uniform. This
is always true of the pressure due to the Λ-term and true of material pressure in
homogeneous cases. In inhomogeneous situations it only occurs astrophysically when
radiative cooling is strong so that denser regions cool to give pressure equality. When
applied to LTB solutions pressure uniformity removes all forces due to pressure gradients
but it leaves the gravity of the changing internal energy and it is this that changes M
due to the external work done. Here we brieﬂy consider how such eﬀects inﬂuence LTB
solutions. We turn to the second equation (10) which is of the same form whether or
not there is a pressure pm(τ ), the only diﬀerence being that M depends on τ as well
as χ. Let us consider a sphere at the moment when it turns around and compare it
with a sphere of the same ε(χ) and the same r which is also at its turn-around in
a pressureless LTB solution. Then the two M must be the same. However, during
the subsequent collapse the M, in the case with pressure, will increase, provided pm
˙M = 4πpmc−2r2(− ˙r), so the subsequent collapse rate will only be
is positive, since
enhanced by the p(τ ) term. When ε ≥ 0 the second equation (10) together with the
requirement that M ≥ 0 shows that no turning points are possible so everything expands
(or in a shrinking universe collapses). When there is no cosmical constant (or when its
eﬀects are negligible), a negative ε(χ) ensures that there will be a turning point where
r = −ε/(GM), so such systems will collapse whether or not they are within an ever
expanding universe.

The considerations at the end of Section 3 suggest that the pressure pm = ̟τ −2 is
a natural choice when Λ = 0 and generally when τ is small. Then equation (7) becomes

− κ̟/τ 2 = −2εZ −4/3 + (4/3) ¨Z/Z ,

Z = r3/2.

(35)

We have already shown that ε < 0 leads to collapse so we here treat the marginal case
ε = 0, which is exactly soluble since the equation is linear in Z. The ansatz Z ∝ τ s+1/2
gives s2 − 1

where M1, A, B, τ1 are ’constants’ of integration dependent on χ. The unperturbed
cosmological solution has B = 0, 3κ̟ = 1 and we see that the B solutions blow up
relative to that cosmological solution near the Big Bang.

5. Characterisation and closure with spherical topology

To characterise and compare diﬀerent model universes we need some measure of how big
or how massive they are. For a closed pure radiation Λ = 0 universe the total entropy
provides a conserved natural measure of its extent. Likewise for a pure dust closed
universe the total gravitational mass within the ε = − 1
2 sphere provides a conserved
natural measure. However when we ask for a conserved natural measure of a universe
containing both dust and radiation, we can not sensibly add entropy to mass and no
natural conserved physical quantity replaces them. A way out of this diﬃculty is to
use the maximum radius of the ε = − 1
2 sphere. While that works well when the
cosmical constant is zero, many closed universes with Λ have no such radius. However
the characteristic radius deﬁned by zero acceleration considered in section 2 can be used
to take over from the turn-around-radius for those universes that lack the latter and
arise from the Big Bang. Furthermore this radius is correctly larger as LTB universes of
larger gravitational mass are considered. Thus although there is no obvious conserved
physical quantity associated with this radius the fact that it can be determined from
the initial conditions and the equations of motion means that it is a conserved quantity
in the sense of dynamics and is thus suitable as a classiﬁcation parameter. In the above
we considered the extent of diﬀerent simple closed spherical universes and showed that
they could collapse to a Big Crunch, or to a growing singularity or could have parts
that expanded for ever.

We now consider criteria for a universe to be closed into a spherical topology by its
own intrinsic curvature rather than by a topologist’s ﬁat. A solid angle of 4π ensures
the closure of a two dimensional surface surrounding a point. We have sought but
not found an integral over the intrinsic curvature of a 3-surface which gives a criterion

Pressure in LTB cosmologies

12

for its closure due to that curvature. By analogy with 2-surfaces we expect that an
unbounded 3-surface which has a positive lower bound to its curvatures will be closed.
Indeed Myers’ theorem [30] states that an n-dimensional Riemannian manifold is closed
if there is no boundary and its Ricci curvature tensor satisﬁes Rµνuµuν ≥ C1 > 0 for
all unit vectors uα with C1 constant. However, that gives only a suﬃcient condition
as there are many surfaces with negative or zero scalar curvatures in places which are
nevertheless closed.

For homogeneous, isotropic, pressure-free universes without a Λ-term all closed
models recollapse after expansion; the converse statement is also true — homogeneous
isotropic models with p = 0 = Λ which recollapse are closed. This, however, is not valid
for LTB models. Bonnor [31] considered the LTB cosmologies without a Λ-term and
gave an example of an open universe ﬁlled with matter in which every sphere eventually
collapses, thus demonstrating that eventual collapse can occur without spatial closure.
So spatial closure neither implies eventual collapse nor is it needed for such collapse.

Now let us turn to the Myers theorem. It was used by Galloway in 1977 [32] to
discuss closure for non-rotating, possibly anisotropic, inhomogeneous dust cosmological
models. His theorem can be generalised to apply to the LTB models with spatially
uniform pressure and a cosmological constant. Following [32] we take the metric in
the form ds2 = dt2 − γjkdxjdxk; in the case of the LTB universes the spatial metric
Introduce a 4-vector X µ tangent to the
is given by the spatial part of metric (12).
hypersurface V 3
t (t = const) at the point P and then extend it along the ﬂow through
P generated by u = ∂/∂t so that the Lie Bracket [u, X] = 0. For the LTB spacetimes
with metric (12) the vector X is given by X µ = (0, X j(r, θ, φ)). Next we calculate the
expansion Θ of a small ﬂuid element given by Θ = uµ
;µ. For the LTB metric with (12)
we obtain Θ = ( ˙r′/r′) + 2( ˙r/r). The averaged Hubble parameter is deﬁned by h = Θ/3.
Now let X = (γklX kX l)1/2 be the length of X. Then according to [32], the ﬁrst two
conditions that ensure closure require that at each point P of a section V 3
t (t = t0)
there is recession in all directions, i.e., ∂X/∂t > 0 for all X, and the rate of recession
is decreasing, ∂2X/∂t2 ≤ 0. These conditions are met soon after the Big Bang in the
LTB models and the topology of the universe can not change as the models evolve so
if the universe is closed, then it remains closed. Expressing X for the LTB models and
requiring ∂X/∂t > 0 and ∂2X/∂t2 ≤ 0 for all X, we arrive at the following inequalities
(38)

¨r < 0 ,

r′¨r′ ≤ 0 ,
˙r ≥ 0 ,
r′¨r′ + ˙r′ + (r′/r)2( ˙r2 + r¨r) − 2(r′/r) ˙r ˙r′ ≤ 0 .

˙r′r′ ≥ 0 ,

(39)
For the homogeneous FLRW universes we just get ˙r ≥ 0, ¨r < 0. The conditions
considered so far remain unaﬀected by pressure or by Λ. The last condition suﬃcient
for closure puts restrictions on the three-dimensional Ricci tensor Rik of V 3
t which may
be expressed in terms of the spatial components of the four-dimensional Ricci tensor
Rik and the time derivatives of gik giving the extrinsic curvature of V 3
in the four-
t
dimensional space-time (see, e.g., equations (7), (9) and (10) in [32]). Now in the
presence of a homogeneous pressure that can involve Λ we ﬁnd the spatial components

Pressure in LTB cosmologies

13

of the four-dimensional Ricci tensor to be given by

Rik = 1

2 gikR + κTik = 1

(40)
Note that our signature is opposite to that used in [32], and −gik = γik introduced above.
The procedure identical to that described in [32] then implies that the last condition
that ensures closure is

2 κ(ρc2 − p)(−gik) .

(41)

inf (cid:2)(4/3)πG(ρc2 − p) − h2(cid:3) = C1 > 0 ,

where h is given by Θ/3 and the inﬁmum is taken for all points in V 3
t0. The LTB model is
closed and ﬁnite if the conditions (38), (39) and (41) are satisﬁed. Since in [32] Λ is not
considered we show what the inequality (41) implies in the simple FLRW model with
dust and Λ. Then h2 = ( ˙a/a)2 and the pressure corresponding to Λ is p = −Λ/κ and
condition (41) becomes ( ˙a/a)2 − 1
3 8πρ/c2 + Λ/3) < 0. This is only slightly stronger
than what follows directly from the exact cosmological equations for FLRW models,
namely ( ˙a/a)2 − ( 1
3 8πρ/c2 + Λ/3) = −k/a2. Thus the model is closed provided k = +1.
In any closed spherically symmetric universe r(χ, τ ) must return to zero at χ = π
say, so there must be a point where r′ = 0 and we found in section 2 that such a point
must be comoving with M reaching its maximum there as a function of χ. When there
is no pressure M is a function of χ alone so this is then an overall maximum.

6. Conclusions

We have explored the derivation of the cosmological models through the Lemaˆıtre-
Tolman-Bondi approach generalized to include homogeneous pressure term and a non-
vanishing cosmological constant. The presence of pressure implies the changing of mass
of each individual spherical shell in the LTB models. If the mass is initially zero then
all of it can be generated by negative pressure as in Hoyle’s continuous creation or
inﬂation. The change of the mass of a sphere can be interpreted as the work done in
the expansion/contraction of the sphere. We considered especially closed models and
pointed out that there are diﬀerent types of motion depending on the repulsive role of
the cosmological term. Using the LTB methods we also obtained explicit homogeneous
cosmological solutions with both the cosmological term and pressure due to radiation.
In a more general setting we analyzed the pressureless closed LTB solution in which
a black hole develops at the origin and then considered the eﬀects of a Λ-term and of
a homogeneous pressure. The Λ-term does not aﬀect the black hole formation but
aﬀects its ﬁnal growth particularly when Λ is larger than (3GMU /c2)−2, where MU is
the constant gravitating mass of half the closed universe. Then the universe expands
for ever leaving behind the black hole. We give the formula for its asymptotic mass.

Although we assume that the material pressure is time-dependent but spatially
homogeneous the gravity of internal energy is changed due to the external work and
such eﬀects inﬂuence the behavior of the LTB solutions. For example, the collapse rate
increases due to the pressure term because mass increases with (positive) pressure.

Pressure in LTB cosmologies

14

By analogy to the radiation-ﬁlled Einstein-de Sitter universe we considered the LTB
models with Λ = 0 and pressure p ∝ τ −2. Under these assumptions we found the LTB
solutions in which the gravitating masses can be explicitly determined. As compared
with homogeneous case some of these inhomogeneous solutions blow up near the Big
Bang relative to the standard models but others can emerge acceptably from the Big
Bang. In more general situations in which the pressure is close to homogeneous, one
can turn to the perturbation theory of the LTB models with pressure we present.

Finally, we applied Myers’ theorem, well-known in geometry but not used in the
LTB context, to give criteria for the self-closure of inhomogeneous spherical cosmologies
with a cosmological constant.

With ε < 0, y > 0, there is one (unphysical) negative root r0 = r3 which is readily found
by the standard procedure of writing r0 = w + y/w and solving the tri-quadratic for

w that results. We thus ﬁnd r3 = −b1/3(cid:2)(1 + √1 − Y 2)1/3 + (1 − √1 − Y 2)1/3(cid:3) , Y =
y3/2/b; since this is a root, we can subtract the expression on the left of (A.4) evaluated
at r3 and divide the result by r0− r3 to ﬁnd the quadratic for the other two roots, which

seek; the other root is the minimum radius of the universe that contracts from inﬁnity
but bounces on the Λ-term before returning to inﬁnity.
