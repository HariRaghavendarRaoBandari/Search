Abstract. For arbitrary positive integer n, we describe a large class of right-angled
Coxeter systems (W, S) for which the visual boundary ∂∞(W, S) is homeomorphic to the
n-dimensional Sierpi´nski compactum. We also provide a necessary and suﬃcient condition
for a planar simplicial complex L under which the right angled Coxeter system (W, S) whose
nerve is L has the visual boundary ∂∞(W, S) homeomorphic to the Sierpi´nski curve.

1. Introduction.

The boundary at inﬁnity (or the visual boundary) of a Coxeter system (W, S) is a
compact metric space canonically associated to the system, denoted ∂∞(W, S). It reﬂects
some aspect of the large-scale behaviour of the associated Coxeter group W , and in case
when W is word-hyperbolic, it coincides with the Gromov boundary ∂W of W . (We refer
the reader to Chapter 12 in [Da] for a detailed exposition of this concept.) In this paper,
for arbitrary positive integer n, we describe, a large class of right-angled Coxeter systems
(W, S) for which the boundary ∂∞(W, S) is homeomorphic to the n-dimensional Sierpi´nski
compactum.

1.1 Deﬁnition. The n-dimensional Sierpi´nski compactum is a compact metric space
described, uniquely up to homeomorphism, as any subspace Π of the sphere Sn+1 satisfying
the following conditions:
(1) the complement of Π is dense in Sn+1;
(2) each connected component U of Sn+1 \ Π is an open (n + 1)-cell in Sn+1, i.e. the
pair (Sn+1, U ) is homeomorphic to the standard pair (Sn+1, int(Bn+1)), where Bn+1
denotes here the hemisphere in Sn+1;

(3) the family U of all connected components of the complement Sn+1 \ Π is null, i.e. for
(4) closures U of the components U ∈ U are pairwise disjoint.

any ǫ > 0 only ﬁnitely many of these components have diameter greater than ǫ;

The uniqueness property in the above deﬁnition was proved by Cannon [Ca], see
also Theorem 7.2.7 in [DV]. The set of conditions appearing in this deﬁnition is called the
positional characterization of the n-dimensional Sierpi´nski compactum. The 1-dimensional
Sierpi´nski compactum coincides with the space better known as Sierpi´nski surve or Sierpi´n-
ski carpet.

We now explain the special terminology appearing in the statement of the main result

of the paper, Theorem 1.3 below.

1.2 Deﬁnition (sphere with holes). An (n + 1)-sphere with holes is a simplicial complex
L equipped with a PL embedding into the PL (n + 1)-sphere Sn+1 satisfying the following
properties:
(0) L is a proper subspace of Sn+1;
(1) L is ﬂag;
(2) for any connected component Ω of Sn+1 \ L, denoting its closure in Sn+1 by Ω, the
pair (Sn+1, Ω) is PL homeomorphic to the standard pair (Sn+1, Bn+1), where the
topological boundary bd(Ω) = Ω \ Ω corresponds to the boundary sphere ∂Bn+1;
(3) the boundary bd(Ω) of any component Ω of Sn+1 \ L is a full subcomplex of L.

The term 3-convexity appearing below in the statement of Theorem 1.3 is explained
in Section 4 (see Deﬁnition 4.1). In the same section we show that for any positive integer
n there are many simplicial complexes L to which the theorem applies.

1.3 Theorem. Let (W, S) be a right-angled Coxeter system whose nerve L is an (n + 1)-
sphere with holes. Suppose also that the following two conditions hold:
(1) for any two distinct connected components of Sn+1 \ L, their closures in Sn+1 are
(2) the boundary bd(Ω) of any component Ω of Sn+1 \ L is a 3-convex subcomplex of L.
Then the visual boundary ∂∞(W, S) is homoemorphic to the n-dimensional Sierpi´nski com-
pactum.

either disjoint, or intersect at a single simplex of L;

Figure 1. Examples of nerves of non-hyperbolic right-angled Coxeter groups

with Sierpi´nski carpet boundaries.

In the case n = 1, Theorem 1.3 can be used to extend Theorem 1 of [Sw2] (which
characterizes those right-angled word-hyperbolic Coxeter groups with planar nerves whose
Gromov boundary is homeomorphic to the Sierpi´nski curve) to non-hyperbolic case. More
precisely, we call a simplicial complex unseparable if it is connected, has no separating

2

simplex, no separating pair of nonadjacent vertices, and no separating full subcomplex iso-
morphic to the (simplicial) suspension of a simplex. Theorem 1.3 yields then the following.

1.4 Corollary. Let (W, S) be a right angled Coxeter system with planar nerve L. Then the
boundary ∂∞(W, S) is homeomorphic to the Sierpi´nski curve if and only if L is unseparable
and distinct from a simplex and from a triangulation of S2.

Examples of some nerves of non-hyperbolic right-angled Coxeter systems with Sierpi´n-
ski carpet boundaries are presented at Figure 1. The ”only if” part of the corollary is
provided by Lemma 1.1 in [Sw2]. Thus, in order to deduce the corollary from Theorem
1.3, it is suﬃcient to note that if a planar ﬂag simplicial complex L is unseparable, distinct
from a simplex and from a triangulation of S2 then it is a 2-sphere with holes satisfying
conditions (1) and (2) of Theorem 1.3. We omit a straightforward proof of this observation.

1.5 Remark. As we show below (in Lemmas 4.8 and 4.9), examples of Coxeter systems
(W, S) to which Theorem 1.3 applies, and for which the corresponding group W is word-
hyperbolic, appear only in dimensions n ∈ {1, 2}. (Non-hyperbolic examples appear in
arbitrary dimension.) This leads to a question, whether there are any right-angled word-
hyperbolic Coxeter groups with Gromov boundary homeomorphic to the n-dimensional
Sierpi´nski compactum, for n ≥ 3. This question seems to remain open.

The paper is organized as follows. Sections 2 and 6 contain essential arguments for
proving Theorem 1.3, and Sections 3–5 present various preparatory results and techniques
applied in these essential arguments. More precisely, in Section 2 we present this part of
the argument which uses only the assumption that the nerve L of a right-angled Coxeter
system (W, S) is an (n + 1)-sphere with holes. Under this restricted assumption, we
construct an embedding of ∂∞(W, S) into Sn+1, and we show that under this embedding
the subspace ∂∞(W, S) satisﬁes conditions (1) and (2) of the positional characterization
(given in Deﬁnition 1.1) of the n-dimensional Sierpi´nski compactum. In Section 6 we use
the full strength of the assumptions of Theorem 1.3, i.e. we assume that the sphere with
holes L satisﬁes also assumptions (1) and (2) from the statement. We then show that, under
the embedding into Sn+1 described in Section 2, the subspace ∂∞(W, S) satisﬁes conditions
(3) and (4) of Deﬁnition 1.1. This concludes the proof that ∂∞(W, S) is homeomorphic to
the n-dimensional Sierpi´nski compactum.

Section 3 contains a preparatory result of independent interest, namely that the visual
boundary of a CAT(0) (n + 1)-dimensional PL manifold with nonempty connected convex
boundary is homeomorphic to the n-disk Bn (see Proposition 3.1, which is in fact slightly
stronger). This result is essentially used in Section 2, to show that under the described
embedding of ∂∞(W, S) in Sn+1 the components of the complement are open (n + 1)-cells
in Sn+1 (which corresponds to condition (2) in Deﬁnition 1.1).

In Section 4 we present the concept of 3-convexity, which appears in assumption (2)
of the statement of Theorem 1.3. We then derive basic properties of this concept, and
discuss existence of nerves L satisfying all the assumptions of Theorem 1.3, for any n.

In Section 5 we consider convex subcomplexes in CAT(0) cubical complexes which
satisfy the additional assumption of local 3-convexity (which means that the link of the
subcomplex at its any vertex is a 3-convex subcomplex in the corresponding vertex link
of the whole complex). We then deduce some rather strong global geometric property of

3

such subcomplexes, which resembles the behaviour of convex subsets in hyperbolic spaces
(see Proposition 5.2 for the statement). This global property plays crucial role in our
arguments in Section 6. The concept of local 3-convexity in CAT(0) cubical complexes
seems to be interesting on its own, and potentially useful for other applications.

In Section 6 (and more precisely in Lemma 6.3) we describe one more technical concept
of independent interest, namely a natural family of metrics (compatible with the topology)
on the visual boundary ∂∞X of a complete CAT(0) space X. Surprisingly, these metrics
seem to be not widely known. We use one of these metrics for showing that the family of
connected components of the complement Sn+1 \ ∂∞(W, S) is null (which corresponds to
condition (3) in Deﬁnition 1.1).

2. Some conclusions for arbitrary (n + 1)-spheres with holes L.

In this section we work under the assumption that the nerve L of a right-angled
Coxeter system (W, S) is an (n + 1)-sphere with holes (i.e. we ignore conditions (1) and
(2) from the statement of Theorem 1.3). We show the following result, which is a ﬁrst
step in the proof of Theorem 1.3. (Note that assertions (1) and (2) below correspond to
conditions (2) and (1) in Deﬁnition 1.1, respectively.)

2.1 Proposition. Let (W, S) be a right-angled Coxeter system whose nerve L is an (n+1)-
sphere with holes. Then
(1) there is an embedding of ∂∞(W, S) in Sn+1 such that the connected components of its

complement are open (n + 1)-cells in Sn+1;

(2) topological dimension of the boundary satisﬁes dim(∂∞(W, S)) = n, and hence for any

embedding of ∂∞(W, S) in Sn+1 the complement is dense in Sn+1.

To get assertion (1) above, we ﬁrst describe and analyze below, after quick review of
the general geometric bockground, a speciﬁc embedding of ∂∞(W, S) in Sn+1. (We will
use this embedding not only here, but also in the later sections of the paper, in other parts
of the proof of Theorem 1.3.) We also make essential use of a technical result, Proposition
3.1, whose statement and proof are presented in the next section. A short proof of assertion
(2) is given at the end of this section.

Throughout this paper we will often work with CAT (0) geodesic metric spaces, as
described e.g. in [BH]. Given a complete CAT(0) space E, we denote by ∂∞E the visual
boundary (at inﬁnity) of E, as deﬁned e.g. in Chapter II.8 in [BH]. We note that if F ⊂ E
is a closed convex subspace of a complete CAT(0) space, then F is also complete and
CAT(0), and the boundary ∂∞F is canonically a subset in the boundary ∂∞E.

Most of the CAT (0) spaces under our interest will be cubical complexes. Recall that
a cubical complex X is CAT(0) (for the standard piecewise euclidean metric dX ) iﬀ X is
connected, simply connected, and its every vertex link Lk(v, X) is a ﬂag simplicial complex
(cf. Theorem 5.20 on p. 212 in [BH]). A subcomplex Y of a CAT(0) cubical complex X
is convex (in the sense that for any two points of Y the geodesic in X connecting these
points is contained in Y ) iﬀ Y is connected and for each vertex v ∈ Y the link Lk(v, Y ) is
a full subcomplex in the corresponding link Lk(v, X).
Recall also that for any right-angled Coxeter system (W, S), its nerve L is a ﬂag sim-
plicial complex, and its associated Coxeter-Davis complex Σ is a CAT (0) cubical complex

4

whose every vertex link is isomorphic to L (see Proposition 7.3.4 and Theorem 12.2.1(i) in
[Da]). If WT is a special subgroup of W corresponding to a subset T ⊂ S, then (WT , T ) is
also a right-angled Coxeter system, and its nerve LT is canonically a full subcomplex of L.
Moreover, the Coxeter-Davis complex ΣT of the system (WT , T ) is canonically a subcom-
plex in Σ, and for any vertex v of ΣT the pair of links (Lk(v, Σ), Lk(v, ΣT )) is isomorphic
to the pair (L, LT ). In particular, ΣT is a convex subcomplex of Σ and its visual boundary
∂∞ΣT is a subspace in ∂∞Σ.

Now, under notation and assumptions of Proposition 2.1, we describe a speciﬁc em-
bedding of ∂∞(W, S) in Sn+1. Given an embedding of L in Sn+1 as in the deﬁnition of an
(n + 1)-sphere with holes, for each connected component Ω of the complement Sn+1 \ L at-
tach to L, along the subcomplex bd(Ω) (which is a PL triangulated n-sphere), the simplicial
cone over this subcomplex. This yields a ﬂag PL triangulation L′ of the sphere Sn+1 such
that L appears in L′ as a full subcomplex. Denote by (W ′, S′) the right-angled Coxeter
system with nerve L′. Since the boundary of a special subgroup is naturally a subspace in
the boundary of a right-angled Coxeter group, we get that ∂∞(W, S) ⊂ ∂∞(W ′, S′). Since
the latter boundary is homeomorphic to the sphere Sn+1 (see e.g. Theorem (3b.2) in [DJ]
or Corollary 1 in [Dr]), it follows that ∂∞(W, S) is embedded in Sn+1.

After ﬁxing an embedding L < L′ as above, note that if L is a trangulation of the
sphere Sn then both assertions of Proposition 2.1 follow from Corollary 3.3 (given in
the next section). Thus, in the remaining part of the argument we assume that L is
not a triangulation of Sn.
In this setting, we introduce some further terminology and
notation which will be used both in this section and in the remaining part of the paper.
Denote by Σ = Σ(W, S) and Σ′ = Σ(W ′, S′) the Coxeter-Davis complexes associated to
the respective Coxeter systems. We then obviously have S ⊂ S′, W < W ′ (as a special
subgroup) and Σ ⊂ Σ′ (as a convex subcomplex in a CAT (0) cubical complex). We
also have ∂∞(W, S) = ∂∞Σ ⊂ ∂∞Σ′ = Sn+1 as the explicit manifestation of the above
mentioned embedding of ∂∞(W, S) in Sn+1.
For any connected component Ω of the complement L′ \ L, let C = bd(Ω) be the
subcomplex of L′ coinciding with the topological boundary of Ω in L′.
It follows from
our assumptions that C is a PL triangulation of Sn, and the pair (L′, C) is (up to PL
homeomorphism) the standard pair of PL spheres (Sn+1, Sn). We call each subcomplex
C as above a peripheral cycle of L in L′. In the now considered case, when L is not a
triangulation of Sn, each peripheral cycle is a proper subcomplex of L.

Note that, by condition (3) in Deﬁnition 1.2, any peripheral cycle C is a full sub-
complex of L. Consequently, it is also a full subcomplex of L′, and thus it describes a
special subgroup of both W ′ and W , which we denote WC (and the corresponding induced
Coxeter system by (WC, SC)). Denote by ΣC = Σ(WC, SC) the Coxeter-Davis complex of
the system (WC, SC), and view it canonically as a subcomplex in Σ′ = Σ(W ′, S′). Since
C is full both in L′ and L, we get that ΣC is a convex subcomplex of both Σ and Σ′.

Since the pair of nerves (L′, C) is the standard pair of PL spheres, locally ΣC looks in
Σ′ like an (n + 1)-dimensional hyperplane in the euclidean (n + 2)-space. Since both ΣC
and Σ′ are connected and simply connected (in fact, they are PL homeomorphic to the
euclidean spaces En+1 and En+2, respectively, see Theorem 10.6.1 in [Da]), it follows that
ΣC decomposes Σ′ into the union of two subcomplexes H such that H \ ΣC is a connected

5

component of Σ′ \ ΣC. We call these subcomplexes the halfspaces for ΣC in Σ′. Note that
each such halfspace H is a convex subcomplex of Σ′. This follows from the following two
observations:

• a vertex link of H either coincides with the corresponding vertex link of Σ′, or these
links form a pair isomorphic to the pair (L′, D), where D is one of the (n+1)-disk
subcomplexes in L′ bounded by C;

• any subcomplex D as above is a full subcomplex of L′.

In particular, H is a CAT (0) cubical PL (n+2)-manifold with convex boundary ∂H = ΣC.
Next lemma is a direct consequence of Proposition 3.1 (a technical result whose state-

ment and proof are given in the next section).

If H0, H1 are the halfspaces for ΣC in Σ′ then, viewing the boundaries

2.2 Lemma.
∂∞Hi, ∂∞ΣC as subspaces in ∂∞Σ′ ∼= Sn+1, we have:
(1) ∂∞H0 ∩ ∂∞H1 = ∂∞ΣC and ∂∞H0 ∪ ∂∞H1 = ∂∞Σ′;
(2) ∂∞Hi are closed (n+1)-cells in ∂∞Σ′ such that bd(∂∞Hi) = ∂∞ΣC, where bd denotes

the topological boundary in ∂∞Σ′;

(3) ∂∞Hi \ ∂∞ΣC are the connected components of ∂∞Σ′ \ ∂∞ΣC, and they are open
(n + 1)-cells in ∂∞Σ′; we also have ∂∞Hi \ ∂∞ΣC = ∂∞Σ′ \ ∂∞Hi+1, where i + 1 is
viewed modulo 2.

2.3 Lemma. Let C be a peripheral cycle of L in L′. Then one of the halfspaces obtained
by splitting Σ′ along ΣC contains Σ, and the other intersects Σ only at ΣC.
Proof: We ﬁrst give an alternative description of the halfspaces for ΣC in Σ′. Recall that
the group W ′ canonically coincides with the vertex set of the cubical complex Σ′, while S′
canonically coincides with the vertex set of L′. Let D+
C be the subcomplex of L′ equal to
the (n + 1)-disk bounded by C and containing L. Denote also by D−
C the complementary
(n + 1)-disk in L′ bounded by C. Consider the following condition for a reduced expression
g = s1 . . . sn of an element g ∈ W ′ (where all si ∈ S′):
(∗) the ﬁrst letter si not belonging to SC, if appears at all in the expression, corresponds

to a vertex in D+

Denote by W +

It follows easily from the Tits’ characterization of reduced expressions in Coxeter groups
(see Theorem 3.4.3 in [Da]) that property (∗) does not depend on the choice of a reduced
expression for g, hence it is a condition for g.
C the set of all g ∈ W ′ whose reduced expresions satisfy (∗). Denote
C in condition (∗) is replaced with D−
also by W −
C .
It is not hard to observe (and we leave it without any further justiﬁcation) that the two
halfspaces for ΣC in Σ′ are exactly the subcomplexes of Σ′ spanned by the sets W +
C and
W −
C , viewed as subsets in the vertex set of Σ′. (Here, by the subcomplex spanned by a
vertex set we mean the maximal subcomplex having this set as the vertex set.) Accordingly,
we denote the two halfspaces by H +

C is a connected component of the comple-
ment ∂∞Σ′ \ ∂∞Σ = Sn+1 \ ∂∞(W, S). This component is an open (n + 1)-cell in Sn+1,
and its topological boundary coincides with ∂∞ΣC.

We now pass to describing all other connected components of the complement of ∂∞Σ
in ∂∞Σ′. Note that the group W acts on ∂∞Σ′ so that it preserves the subspace ∂∞Σ. In
particular, for any w ∈ W the set ∂∞Σ′ \ w · ∂∞H +
C ) is a connected
component of ∂∞Σ′ \ ∂∞Σ. Moreover, one easily observes that

Due to the above observation (1), we denote by ∂∞Σ′ \ ∂∞( ¯w · H +
C ), where ¯w ∈ W/WC
is a coset, the space ∂∞Σ′ \ ∂∞(w · H +

observations (1) and (2), the family

) are distinct.

∂∞Σ′ \ ∂∞( ¯w · H +

C ) : C is a peripheral cycle of L in L′, and ¯w ∈ W/WC

consists of pairwise distinct connected components of ∂∞Σ′ \ ∂∞Σ. We will show that in
fact there are no other components in this complement.
2.5 Lemma. Each connected component of ∂∞Σ′\∂∞Σ has a form U = ∂∞Σ′\∂∞( ¯w·H +
C )
for some peripheral cycle C of L in L′, and for some coset ¯w ∈ W/WC.
Proof: Start with observing that

Σ =\C \¯w∈W/WC

¯w · H +
C ,

where C runs through all peripheral cycles of L in L′. This follows fairly easily from the
description of the vertex sets of the halfspaces H +
C , as given in the proof of Lemma 2.3.
As a consequence, we have

∂∞Σ =\C \¯w∈W/WC

∂∞( ¯w · H +
C ).

From this we get that

∂∞Σ′ \ ∂∞Σ = ∂∞Σ′ \ \C \¯w∈W/WC

∂∞( ¯w · H +

C )! =[C [¯w∈W/WC(cid:18)∂∞Σ′ \ ∂∞( ¯w · H +
C )(cid:19),

which clearly yields the assertion.

Denoting by Per(L, L′) the set of all peripheral cycles of L in L′, we can summarize

the above discussion as follows.

7

2.6 Corollary. Let L be an (n + 1)-sphere with holes distinct from a triangulation of the
sphere Sn, and let L < L′ ∼= Sn+1 be an embedding as described at the beginning of this
section. Then

U = {∂∞Σ′ \ ∂∞( ¯w · H +

C ) : C ∈ Per(L, L′), ¯w ∈ W/WC}

is the family of all connected components of the complement ∂∞Σ′ \ ∂∞Σ. Each U ∈ U
is an open (n + 1)-cell in ∂∞Σ′ = Sn+1. If U = ∂∞Σ′ \ ∂∞( ¯w · H +
C ) then its closure U
and its topological boundary bd(U ) in ∂∞Σ′ can be expressed as U = ∂∞( ¯w · H −
C ) and
bd(U ) = ∂∞( ¯w · ΣC).
Proof of Proposition 2.1(1): In the case when L is a triangulation of Sn, the assertion
follows from Corollary 3.3 (given in the next section). In the remaining case, it follows
from Corollary 2.6.

Proof of Proposition 2.1(2): Denote by vcd(W ) the virtual cohomological dimension
of W . It follows from results of Mike Davis that

vcd(W ) = max{k : H

k−1

(L \ σ) 6= 0, for some simplex σ of L, or H

k−1

(L) 6= 0}

(see Corollary 8.5.5 in [Da]). Moreover, by the fact that W acts geometrically on Σ and
is virtually torsion-free, the pair (Σ ∪ ∂∞(W, S), ∂∞(W, S)) is a Z-structure (in the sense
of Bestvina described in [Be]) for any torsion-free ﬁnite index subgroup H < W . Since,
by Theorem 1.7 of [Be] we then have dim ∂∞(W, S) = cd(H) − 1 (where cd(H) is the
cohomological dimension of H), it follows that dim ∂∞(W, S) = vcd(W ) − 1. Since L is a
proper subpolyhedron in Sn+1, we get (from the above formula of Davis) that vcd(W ) ≤ n,
and hence dim(∂∞(W, S)) ≤ n.
On the other hand, being an (n + 1)-sphere with holes, L contains a full subcomplex
C which is a PL triangulation of the sphere Sn. Denote by (WC, SC) the Coxeter system
for the special subgroup WC < W induced by C. By Theorem (3b.2)(iii) of [DJ], the
boundary ∂∞(WC, SC) is then homeomorphic to Sn, and thus the boundary ∂∞(W, S)
contains an embedded copy of Sn. Hence dim(∂∞(W, S)) ≥ n, which completes the proof.
3. Visual boundary of a CAT (0) manifold with convex boundary.

It is known that the visual boundary of a complete CAT (0) PL (n + 1)-manifold is
homeomorphic to the sphere Sn (see [DJ], Theorem (3b.2)(iii)). The aim of this section is
to extend this result as follows.

3.1 Proposition. Let H be a complete piecewise euclidean CAT (0) PL-manifold of di-
mension n + 1 with nonempty connected convex boundary N = ∂H. Then the pair of
visual boundaries (∂∞H, ∂∞N ) is homeomorphic to the pair (Bn, Sn−1), where Bn is the
standard closed euclidean n-ball and Sn−1 = ∂Bn.

Before getting to the proof of the proposition, we present its two immediate corollaries,

which are of independent interest.

3.2 Corollary. Let M be a complete piecewise euclidean PL (n + 1)-manifold and N its
closed connected PL submanifold of dimension n. Suppose that M is CAT (0) and N is

8

convex in M . Then the pair of visual boundaries (∂∞M, ∂∞N ) is homeomorphic to the
standard pair of spheres (Sn, Sn−1).

Next corollary concerns arbitrary Coxeter groups, not only the right-angled ones.

3.3 Corollary. Let (W ′, S′) be a Coxeter system whose nerve L′ is a PL triangulation of
the n-sphere. Let L be a full subcomplex of L′ such that the pair (L′, L) is PL homeomorphic
to the standard pair of spheres (Sn, Sn−1). Let S be the vertex set of L, and denote
by (W, S) the Coxeter system of the special subgroup induced by S. Then the pair of
visual boundaries (∂∞(W ′, S′), ∂∞(W, S)) is homeomorphic to the standard pair of spheres
(Sn, Sn−1).

Proof: Denote by Σ′ and Σ the Coxeter-Davis complexes of the systems (W ′, S′) and
(W, S), respectively. Viewed naturally as a subcomplex, Σ is convex in Σ′. Moreover,
under assumptions on L′ and L, Σ′ is a complete piecewise euclidean CAT (0) PL-manifold
of dimension n + 1, and Σ is its convex closed PL submanifold of dimension n. Corollary
3.2 yields then the assertion.

The rest of this section is devoted to the proof of Proposition 3.1. In this proof we
follow the lines of the proof of Theorem (3b.2)(iii) in [DJ] (see also the appendix in [Sw1]).
In particular, we use the technique of cellular sets and cell-like maps, whose basic elements
we now recall.

In our setting below, a manifold is a (not necessarily compact) topological manifold
with boundary (possibly empty). A compact subset E of a manifold M is cellular if the
quotient space M/E (obtained by collapsing E to a point) is homeomorphic to M , and the
quotient map q : M → M/E can be approximated by homeomorphisms. The latter means
that for any ﬁxed metric d in M/E (compatible with the topology) and any continuous
positive function δ : M → R+ there is a homeomorphism h : M → M/E such that for all
x ∈ M we have d(q(x), h(x)) < δ(x).
Cellular subsets of a manifold can be also characterised as admitting systems of neigh-
bourhoods of a special form. To make a precise statement, recall that an n-cell in an
n-dimensional manifold M is any subset B ⊂ M which in some neighbourhood in M looks
like:
(1) Bn in Rn, if B ⊂ int(M );
(2) Bn

+ = {x ∈ Rn

A nonempty compact metric space of ﬁnite topological dimension is cell-like if it can
be embedded as a cellular subset in some manifold (for justiﬁcation of this characterization,

9

see the remark in the middle of page 114 in [Ed]). Obviously, each cellular subset of a
manifold is cell-like, but the converse is not true (i.e. there are non-cellular embeddings
of cell-like spaces in manifolds). A map between metric spaces is cell-like if it is a proper
surjection and each point preimage is cell-like.

We now recall few preparatory results which will be needed in our proof of Proposition
3.1. The next result is due to Siebenmann [Si] for n ≥ 5, Quinn [Qu] for n = 4, Armentrout
[Ar] for n = 3 and R. L. Moore [Mo] for n ≤ 2. The case of manifolds with nonempty
boundary is carefully addressed in [Si], and the cases involving dimension 3 hold because
the Poincare conjecture is true.

3.5 Approximation Theorem. Each cell-like map between manifolds with boundary is
a near-homeomorphism, i.e. it can be approximated by homeomorphisms. More precisely,
if f : M → N is cell-like and d is any metric in N (compatible with the topology) then for
any continuous positive function δ : M → R+ there is a homeomorphism h : M → N such
that for all x ∈ M we have d(f (x), h(x)) ≤ δ(x).

The next result seems to be well known (it appears as Lemma 2 in the appendix to

[Sw1], where its proof is included).

If f : A → B is a cell-like surjection between ﬁnite dimensional metric

Next two preparatory results give some useful criteria for recognizing cellular subsets
in spheres and disks. First of them presents a well known characterization of cellular
subsets in spheres Sn as those which are point-like (i.e.
such that the complement is
homeomorphic to Rn). The second one is a less well known analogue for those subsets in
disks which intersect the boundary.

3.7 Lemma (see Theorem on page 114 in [Ed]). A closed subset E of the sphere Sn is
cellular iﬀ the complement Sn \ E is homeomorhic to Rn.
3.8 Lemma. Let E be a closed subset of the n-disk Dn such that E ∩ ∂Dn 6= ∅. Suppose
that the complement Dn \ E is homeomorphic to Rn
Proof: We need to indicate arbitrarily close open neighbourhoods of E in Dn which are
open n-cells (of the form (Bn

and let Br denote the euclidean closed ball of radius r in Rn

r → ∞, the set Dn \ h(Br) becomes as close to E as necessary. We claim that Dn \ h(Br)
is also an open n-cell in Dn. This follows fairly directly from the generalized Schoenﬂies
theorem.

+. Then E is cellular in Dn.

+)◦). Let h : Rn

Having ﬁnished the preparations, we now state two auxilliary results which will lead
us to the proof of Proposition 3.1. The term π-convexity appearing in Lemma 2 means
that any geodesic of length less than π having both endpoints in the subspace, is entirely
contained in this subspace.

Lemma 1. Let n be a positive integer, and let H be a complete piecewise euclidean CAT (0)
PL-manifold of dimension n, with nonempty connected convex boundary N = ∂H. Then
for any x ∈ N and any R > 0:

10

(B(n)) the sphere SR(x, H) is an (n − 1)-manifold and SR(x, N ) is its boundary;
(C(n)) for any R′ > R the geodesic projection towards x, ρR′,R : SR′ (x, H) → SR(x, H),
(D(n)) the pair (SR(x, H), SR(x, N )) is homeomorphic to the pair (Bn−1, Sn−2).

is a cell-like map;

Lemma 2. Let n be a positive integer, and let P be a complete piecewise spherical CAT (1)
PL-manifold of dimension n, with nonempty π-convex boundary Q = ∂P . Then for any
v ∈ Q:
(AS(n)) for any R ∈ (0, π] the open metric ball BR(v, P ) is homeomorphic to the open
(CS(n)) for any R < R′ < π the geodesic projection towards v, ρR′,R : SR′ (v, P ) →

n-dimensional half disk, and BR(v, Q) corresponds to its boundary;

SR(v, P ), is a cell-like map.

We will prove all the assertions of Lemmas 1 and 2 by induction with respect to the
dimension n. For n = 1 all of these statements are obviously true. The main inductive
step will consist of the following implications:

• AS(n − 1) ⇒ [B(n) ∧ CS(n) ∧ C(n)];
• [B(n) ∧ C(n)] ⇒ D(n);
• CS(n) ⇒ AS(n).

We will also show (prior to proving the lemmas) the implication (∀n C(n) ∧ D(n)) ⇒
Proposition 3.1.

Proof of Proposition 3.1 (assuming ∀n C(n) ∧ D(n)):
and let x ∈ N ⊂ H be any point. Recall that we have

Let H and N satisfy the assumptions of the proposition (in particular, dim H = n+1),

∂∞H = lim
←−

[{SR(x, H) : R > 0}, {ρR′,R : R′ > R}]

and

∂∞N = lim
←−

[{SR(x, N ) : R > 0}, {ρR′,R|SR′ (x,N) : R′ > R}],

where ρR′,R are the geodesic projections. Since by C(n+1) these bonding maps ρR′,R are all
cell-like, it follows from Approximation Theorem 3.5 that they are near-homeomorphisms.
By a result of M. Brown (Theorem 4 in [Br]), if we ﬁx an increasing sequence of radii Ri →
∞, then we can also choose homeomorphisms hi : SRi (x, H) → SRi−1(x, H) (appropriately
close to the maps ρRi,Ri−1) such that the visual boundary ∂∞H is homeomorphic to the
inverse limit

lim
←−

[{SRi(x, H)}, {hi}].

By D(n + 1), this inverse limit is homeomorphic to Bn. Moreover, according to Brown’s
description of an explicit homeomorphism F : ∂∞H → lim←−[{SRi (x, H)}, {hi}] as above
(provided in the proof of Theorem 1 in [Br]), any point z ∈ ∂∞H which is represented
by a string (zi) (of the inverse system [{SRi(x, H)}, {ρRi,Ri−1}]) is mapped by F to a
point y represented by a string (yi) given by yi = limj>i hi ◦ . . .◦ hj−1(zj). In particular, if
z ∈ ∂∞N , we have that all zi ∈ SRi(x, N ), and consequently all yi ∈ SRi (x, N ) too, because

11

homeomorphisms preserve boundary. It follows that under F the subset ∂∞N ⊂ ∂∞H is
mapped to the subset

lim
←−

[{SRi(x, N )}, {hi|SRi (x,N)}] ∼= Sn−1 ⊂ Bn ∼= lim

←−

[{SRi(x, H)}, {hi}].

Since we know that ∂∞N is homeomorphic to Sn−1 (by the result from [DJ] mentioned
at the beginning of this section), it follows that F maps ∂∞N onto the above subset, and
this completes the proof.

We now turn to the inductive proof of Lemmas 1 and 2, following the scheme outlined

right after the statement of Lemma 2.
Proof of the implication AS(n − 1) ⇒ B(n):
We refer to the argument as in the proof of the implication (Ln−1) ⇒ (Tn) in [DJ],
in a long paragraph beginning at the end of page 371 and ending in the middle of the
next page. This argument, without any change, shows that SR(x, H) \ SR(x, N ) is an
(n − 1)-manifold. Thus, to get B(n), it is suﬃcient to show that any y ∈ SR(x, N ) has an
open neighbourhood in SR(x, H) homeomorphic to the (n− 1)-dimensional open half-disk
(Bn−1
+ )◦. For the latter, it is obviously suﬃcient to show that any y as above has a closed
neighbourhood ∆ in the closed ball BR(x, H) such that the pair (∆, ∆ ∩ BR(x, N )) is
homeomorphic to the pair (Bn
), with y corresponding to a point on the boundary
∂Bn−1

+, Bn−1

So let y ∈ SR(x, N ) be any point. Denote by v ∈ Lk(y, H) the point induced by the
geodesic [y, x]. The argument from [DJ] mentioned above, after applying to our setting,
shows that for small ε > 0 the ball of radius ε in BR(x, H) centered at y is homeomorphic
to the quotient

.

Bπ/2(v, Lk(y, H)) × [0, ε] / Bπ/2(v, Lk(y, H)) × {0} ∪ Sπ/2(v, Lk(y, H)) × [0, ε],

where the intersection of this ε-ball with BR(x, N ) corresponds to the subset

Bπ/2(v, Lk(y, N )) × [0, ε] / Bπ/2(v, Lk(y, N )) × {0} ∪ Sπ/2(v, Lk(y, N )) × [0, ε]

+ )◦, (Bn−2

and where y corresponds to the point obtained from the collapsed set. Now, it follows
from AS(n− 1) that the pair of open metric balls (Bπ/2(v, Lk(y, H)), Bπ/2(v, Lk(y, N ))) is
homeomorphic to the standard pair of open balls ((Bn−1
)◦). This easily implies
the last assertion of the previous paragraph, and hence completes the proof.
Proof of the implication AS(n − 1) ⇒ [CS(n) ∧ C(n)]:
We present a proof of the implication AS(n − 1) ⇒ C(n), and it will become clear
that the same argument yields also the implication AS(n − 1) ⇒ CS(n).
Let p ∈ SR(x, H), and denote shortly by ρ the geodesic projection ρR′,R : SR′ (x, H) →
SR(x, H). To prove that ρ is cell-like, we need to show that the preimage ρ−1(p) is a cell-
like set. We will show this for the case when p ∈ SR(x, N ), by an argument following that
in the proof of Lemma (3b.1) and Theorem (3b.2) in [DJ] (see also the appendix to [Sw1]).
The argument in the remaining case p ∈ SR(x, H) \ SR(x, N ) is analogous, follows more

12

directly from that in [DJ], builds upon Lemma 3.7 rather than Lemma 3.8, and we omit
its details.

So suppose p ∈ SR(x, N ). Our proof consists of two steps which correspond to the

following two claims.
Claim 1. Let y ∈ N = ∂H, and let v be any point from the sublink Lk(y, N ) ⊂ Lk(y, H)
(where the latter pair of links is homeomorphic to the standard pair (Bn−1, ∂Bn−1)). Then
the complement in L := Lk(y, H) of the open ball Bπ(v, L) is a cellular subset of L.

˜R′,R

To prove Claim 1, denote the complement L\Bπ(v, L) by ShL(v) and call it the shadow
of v in L. Since N is a complete CAT (0) manifold, it satisﬁes the geodesic extension
property, and since it is convex in H, it follows that the shadow ShL(v) has nonempty
intersection with the sublink Lk(y, N ). Thus, ShL(v) is a closed subset in the (n − 1)-disk
L, and it intersects the boundary ∂L. On the other hand, by AS(n − 1), the complement
L \ ShL(v) = Bπ(v, L) is homeomorphic to the open (n − 1)-dimensional half-disk.
It
follows then from Lemma 3.8 that Sh(v, L) is cellular in L, hence the claim.
Claim 2. If p ∈ SR(x, N ) then the preimage ρ−1(p) is cell-like.
To prove Claim 2 we use an idea communicated to us by Mike Davis. Suppose a con-
trario that the preimage ρ−1(p) is not cell-like. Consider all geodesic rays in H started
at x and passing through p, and let [x, ˜p] be the largest geodesic segment contained in all
of those geodesic rays (it may happen that ˜p = p). Consider the link Lk(˜p, H) and the
point ˜v ∈ Lk(˜p, H) corresponding to the geodesic segment [x, ˜p]. Then the shadow of ˜v
in Lk(˜p, H) is nontrivial. Put ˜R = dH(x, ˜p). Since ˜p has a metric cone neighbourhood
in H (see e.g. Theorem 7.16 on page 104 in [BH]), there is ˜R′ > ˜R such that the preim-
age ρ−1
(p) is homeomorphic to the shadow ShLk(˜p,H)(˜v). In particular, it follows from
Claim 1 that ρ−1
(p) is homeomorphic to a cellular subset of Lk(˜p, H), and hence it is
cell-like. Since we have ρ−1(p) = ρ−1
p1 ∈ ρ−1
Iterating the argument as above, we get an inﬁnite sequence of points pn lying on
a common ﬁnite geodesic segment started at x with the following property: denoting by
vn ∈ Lk(pn, H) the point corresponding to the segment [x, pn], we have that the shadow
ShLk(pn,H)(vn) is nontrivial. On the other hand, it is not hard to realize that for any
geodesic segment [x, y] the set of points p ∈ [x, y] with such nontrivial shadows is discrete,
and hence ﬁnite (cf. Fact 4 in the appendix to [Sw1]). This contradiction concludes the
proof of Claim 2, and hence also the proof of the implication AS(n − 1) ⇒ C(n).
Proof of the implication [B(n) ∧ C(n)] ⇒ D(n):
Note that, if r > 0 is suﬃciently small, the pair (Sr(x, H), Sr(x, N )) is homeomorphic
to the pair (Bn−1, Sn−2) by the fact that x has a metric cone neighbourhood in H. Since
by C(n), for any R > r the map ρR,r : SR(x, H) → Sr(x, H) is cell-like, the assertion of
D(n) follows from Approximation Theorem 3.5 combined with B(n).
Proof of the implication CS(n) ⇒ AS(n):
Note that for small R the assertion of AS(n) follows from the existence of a metric
cone neighbourhood of v in P . Fix some r > 0 such that Br(v, P ) is a cone neighbourhood.
It remains to prove the assertion for R ∈ (r, π]. Given any R as above, put c := r
R , and

(p)], it follows from Lemma 3.6 that there is

R′, ˜R′ [ρ−1
˜R′,R

(p) such that ρ−1

R′, ˜R′ (p1) is not cell-like.

consider the map f : BR(v, P ) → Br(v, P ) deﬁned as follows. For any p ∈ BR(v, P ) put
rp := dP (v, p), and then put f (p) := ρrp,crp(p). Obviously, f is a continuous surjection
between open balls (which are n-manifolds), and we claim that f is cell-like.
Indeed,
obviously we have f −1(v) = {v}, and for any q ∈ Br(v, P ), q 6= v, putting rq = dP (v, q), the
preimage f −1(q) is easily seen to be homeomorphic to the set ρ−1
(q). Since rq/c < R ≤
π, it follows from CS(n) that the latter set is cell-like, and hence f is cell-like as well. Now,
applying Approximation Theorem 3.5 we get a homeomorphism h : BR(v, P ) → Br(v, P ),
which shows that BR(v, P ) is homeomorphic to the open n-dimensional half-disk. Since
obviously we have ∂BR(v, P ) = BR(v, Q), the second part of the assertion of AS(n) follows
as well, which completes the proof.

4. 3-convexity in simplicial complexes.

In this section we present the concept of 3-convexity for subcomplexes in simplicial
complexes, and discuss existence of various classes of examples of simplicial complexes L
satisfying all the assumptions of Theorem 1.3.

3-convexity.

Given a simplicial complex K, we consider the combinatorial distance function distK
between its vertices given by minimizing the length (i.e. the number of edges) of polygonal
paths in the 1-skeleton K (1) of K connecting these vertices.

4.1 Deﬁnition (3-convexity). A subcomplex J in a simplicial complex K is 3-convex if it
is a full subcomplex and if for any two vertices of J staying at distance 2 in K any path
of length 2 in K (1) connecting these vertices is entirely contained in J.

Next lemma presents a useful property of 3-convex subcomplexes. Given a simplex σ
in a simplicial complex K, we denote by stK (σ), and call the star of σ in K, the subcomplex
of K being the union of all simplices of K containing σ.

4.2 Lemma. A full subcomplex J of a ﬂag simplicial complex K is 3-convex if and only
if for any vertex v ∈ J the union J ∪ stK (v) is a full subcomplex of K. Moreover, if J is
3-convex in K then for any simplex σ ∈ J the union J ∪ stK (σ) is a full subcomplex of K.
Proof: Let σ ∈ J and let v1, . . . , vm be any vertices of J ∪ stK(σ) pairwise connected with
edges in K. By ﬂagness of K, there is a simplex spanned on these vertices, and we denote
it τ . We need to show that τ ⊂ J ∪ stK (σ).
If v1, . . . , vm ∈ J, we get τ ⊂ J by fullness of J, and this clearly yields the assertion.
We will show that otherwise all vertices v1, . . . , vm are contained in stK (σ). Let v ∈
{v1, . . . , vm} be a vertex not contained in J, and suppose that u ∈ {v1, . . . , vm} is a vertex
not contained in stK (σ). Then u ∈ J, and there is w ∈ σ such that distK (u, w) = 2. By
3-convexity of J, the geodesic path (u, v, w) is then contained in J, which contradicts the
choice of v. Thus, {v1, . . . , vm} ⊂ stK (σ) in this case, and the assertion follows by the fact
that star of any simplex in a ﬂag simplicial complex is its full subcomplex.
To complete the proof, it remains to show that if for each vertex v ∈ J the union
J ∪ stK (v) is full in K then J is 3-convex in K. Let v1, v2 be any vertices of J lying at
distance 2 in K, and let (v1, w, v2) be any geodesic between them in K (1). If w /∈ J then
we have [w, v2] 6⊂ J ∪ stK (v1), contradicting fullnes of the latter union.

Constructing 3-convex subcomplexes.

In this subsection, given any polyhedron P and its subpolyhedron Q, we present a
construction of a ﬂag triangulation of P for which Q forms a 3-convex subcomplex. This
construction allows to justify the existence of many simplicial complexes L satisfying the
assumptions of Theorem 1.3, in arbitrary dimension n (see Example 4.6 below).

4.3 Deﬁnition (relative barycentric subdivision). Let K be a simplicial complex and
J its subcomplex. The barycentric subdivision of K relative to J, denoted K ′
J , is the
subdivision of K obtained as follows. First, subdivide barycentrically each 1-simplex of K
not contained in J, and then, recursively with respect to the dimension, subdivide each
higher dimensional simplex not contained in J by coning its already subdivided boundary.
Alternatively, take as the vertex set of K ′
J all vertices of J and the barycenters b(σ) of
all simplices σ of K not contained in J; simplices of K ′
J are spanned precisely by the sets
of form {v1, . . . , vq, b(σ1), . . . , b(σp)}, where q ≥ 0, p ≥ 0, the vertices v1, . . . , vq span a
simplex τ of J (empty when q = 0), σ1, . . . , σp are some simplices of K not contained in
J, and τ ⊂ σ1 ⊂ . . . ⊂ σp.

Note that the subcomplex J ⊂ K, with its original simplicial structure induced from
J . Next few lemmas collect various further properties of

K, is also a subcomplex of K ′
relative barycentric subdivision.

4.4 Lemma. If a subcomplex J of a simplicial complex K is ﬂag then the subdivision K ′
J
is also ﬂag. In particular, if J is a full subcomplex of a ﬂag complex K then the subdivision
K ′

J is also ﬂag.

Proof: Let A be a set of vertices of K ′
J which are pairwise connected with edges. Suppose
A = {u1, . . . , uk, b(ρ1), . . . , b(ρm)}, where u1, . . . , uk are some vertices of J and ρ1, . . . , ρm
are some simplices of K not contained in J. By the assumption on A, the vertices u1, . . . , uk
are pairwise connected with edges of J, and since J is ﬂag, they span a simplex τ in J.
Again, by the assumption on A, for any two simplices ρi, ρj one of them is a face of the
other. Consequently, we may assume that ρ1 ⊂ . . . ⊂ ρm. Moreover, the existence of edges
in K ′
J between b(ρ1) and any of the ui implies that τ ⊂ ρ1. It follows then directly from
J (in Deﬁnition 4.3) that the set A spans a simplex of K ′
the description of simplices in K ′
J .
Hence ﬂagness of K ′
J .

4.5 Lemma. If a subcomplex J of a simplicial complex K is ﬂag and full in K then J is
a 3-convex subcomplex of K ′
J . In particular, if J is a full subcomplex of a ﬂag complex K
then J is 3-convex in K ′
J .

Proof: The fact that J is a full subcomplex of K ′
J is obvious. To show that J is also
3-convex, consider any vertices v, w of J at combinatorial distance 2 in K ′
J . Suppose on
the contrary that there is a combinatorial geodesic (v, u, w) in the 1-skeleton of K ′
J such
that u /∈ J. By deﬁnition of K ′
J , the 1-simplex (v, u) must have the form (v, bσ) for some
simplex σ of K containing v, and (u, w) must have the form (bτ , w) for some simplex τ
of K containing w. It follows that σ = τ , and we get that u and w belong to the same
simplex of K. Since J is full in K, the edge (v, w) is an edge of J, and hence also an edge
of K ′

J , contradicting the fact that distK ′

(v, w) = 2.

4.6 Example. Using Lemmas 4.4 and 4.5, one can construct many simplicial complexes
L satisfying the assumptions of Theorem 1.3, in arbitrary dimension n. Indeed, consider
any PL triangulation N of the (n + 1)-sphere, and any collection σ1, . . . , σk of pairwise
nonintersecting (n + 1)-simplices of N , with k ≥ 1. Let M be the simplicial complex
obtained from N be deleting interiors of all simplices σ1, . . . , σk. Obviously, M is a PL
triangulation of an (n+1)-manifold with boundary (k times punctured (n+1)-sphere). Let
M ′ be the ﬁrst barycentric subdivision of M , and let J be its subcomplex corresponding
to the boundary. Then obviously M ′ is ﬂag, and J is a full subcomplex of M ′. Putting
L = (M ′)′
J , we obtain (in view of Lemma 4.4) a ﬂag simplicial complex for which J is (by
Lemma 4.5) a 3-convex subcomplex. Consequently, the connected components of J (which
correspond to subcomplexes bd(Ω) of Deﬁnition 1.2) are also 3-convex in L. This shows
that L satisﬁes all the assumptions of Theorem 1.3.

Similarly, given any polyhedron P and its any subpolyhedron Q, and starting from any
triangulation M of P for which Q induces a subcomplex, we can apply the same procedure
as above to get a ﬂag triangulation L of P for which Q induces a 3-convex subcomplex.

Flag-no-square spheres with holes having all peripheral cycles 3-convex.

In this subsection we discuss existence of examples of (n + 1)-spheres with holes, in
various dimensions n, satisfying all the assumptions of Theorem 1.3, and such that the
associated Coxeter group W is word-hyperbolic.

Recall that, given an (n+1)-sphere with holes L (viewed as PL embedded in the sphere
Sn+1), a peripheral cycle in L is any subcomplex C which is induced by the topological
boundary bd(Ω) of a connected component Ω of the complement Sn+1 \ L.
A simplicial complex K is said to satisfy the ﬂag-no-square condition if it is ﬂag and
for any closed cycle γ of length 4 in the
the following no-empty-square property holds:
1-skeleton of K there is at least one diagonal of γ (i.e. an edge connecting some pair of
opposite vertices of γ) in K. Recall that a right-angled Coxeter group W is word-hyperbolic
if and only if its nerve L satisﬁes the ﬂag-no-square condition (see Corollary 12.6.3 in [Da],
as applied to the right angled case).

We will ﬁrst show an example of a 3-sphere with holes which is ﬂag-no-square and
which satisﬁes all the assumptions of Theorem 1.3. More precisely, by Lemma 4.8 below,
the 580-disk described in Deﬁnition 4.7 is such an example. In view of Theorem 1.3, this
leads to an example of a right-angled hyperbolic Coxeter group whose Gromov boundary
is homeomorphic to the 2-dimensional Sierpi´nski compactum. On the other hand, we will
show that for n ≥ 3 there are no examples of (n + 1)-spheres with holes which satisfy the
ﬂag-no-square condition, and to which Theorem 1.3 applies (see Lemma 4.9 below).
Consider the 600-cell, the convex regular 4–polytope with Schl¨aﬂi symbol {3, 3, 5}
(see e.g.
[C]). Denote by X600 the boundary of the 600–cell, a 3-dimensional simplicial
polyhedron homeomorphic to the 3-dimensional sphere. Recall that, when viewed as a
simplicial complex, X600 consists of 600 3-simplices and has 120 vertices. Its vertex links are
icosahedra and edge links are pentagons. We will only exploit the combinatorial simplicial
structure of X600.

4.7 Deﬁnition. The 580-disk is the simplicial complex obtained from X600 by deleting
open star of any vertex. We denote it by X580.

16

Note that X580 is a PL triangulation of the 3-dimensional disk B3 consisting of 580
3-simplices, and its boundary ∂X580, which corresponds to the link of the deleted vertex,
is an icosahedral triangulation of the 2-sphere.

4.8 Lemma. The 580-disk X580 is a ﬂag-no-square simplicial complex, and the boundary
∂X580 is its 3-convex subcomplex.

Proof: To prove the lemma, we need the following fact, whose proof can be found in [PS]
(see Lemma 2.1 in that paper).

Lemma 1. X600 satisﬁes the ﬂag-no-square property.

Next two claims exhibit basic properties of the 580-disk, resulting from Lemma 1.

Claim 1. The 580-disk X580 satisﬁes the ﬂag-no-square property.

To get Claim 1, note that X580 is a full subcomplex in X600. This follows from a more
general easy observation that, given any simplicial complex K and its any vertex v, the
subcomplex of K obtained by deleting the open star of v is full. Since the ﬂag-no-square
property is inherited by full subcomplexes, the claim follows by referring to Lemma 1.

Claim 2. The boundary ∂X580 is a full subcomplex of the 580-disk X580.

To get Claim 2, denote by D the closed star of this vertex of X600 which does not
belong to X580. Since closed star of any vertex in a ﬂag simplicial complex is a full
subcomplex, and since X600 is ﬂag (see Lemma 1), we get that D is a full subcomplex of
X600. Since ∂X580 = D ∩ X580, the claim is a consequence of the following general fact:
if A is a full subcomplex of a simplicial complex K then for any subcomplex B of K the
intersection A ∩ B is a full subcomplex of B.

In view of Claims 1 and 2, it remains to show that, given any two vertices x, z of ∂X580
at combinatorial distance 2 in the 1-skeleton of X580, and any polygonal path (x, y, z)
connecting them in X580, we have y ∈ ∂X580. View X580 as a subcomplex in X600, and let
v be the vertex of X600 not contained in X580. Consider the 4-cycle (x, y, z, v, x) in X600.
Since the combinatorial distance between x and z in the 1-skeleton of X600 is easily seen
to be 2 (e.g. since X580 is full in X600), it follows from Lemma 1 that y is adjacent to v in
X600. But this means that y ∈ ∂X580, which completes the proof of Lemma 4.8.

Our ﬁnal observation is the following lemma, which implies that using Theorem 1.3,
one cannot construct an example of a right-angled word-hyperbolic Coxeter group whose
Gromov boundary is an n-dimensional Sierpi´nski compactum, for any n ≥ 3.
4.9 Lemma. If n ≥ 3, then there is no (n + 1)-sphere with holes L satisfying conditions
(1) and (2) of Theorem 1.3 and the ﬂag-no-square condition.

Proof: Let L be an (n + 1)-sphere with holes satisfying the assumtions (1) and (2) of
Theorem 1.3 and the ﬂag-no-square condition. For any peripheral cycle C of L, attach to
L the simplicial cone over C, thus getting a PL triangulation L′ of the (n + 1)-sphere. We
will show that L′ satisﬁes the ﬂag-no-square condition.

Flagness of L′ easily follows from ﬂagness of L and the fact that the peripheral cycles
It remains to show that L′ satisﬁes the no-empty-square

are full subcomplexes of L.

condition. More precisely, let γ = (w, x, y, z, w) be a 4-cycle in the 1-skeleton of L′. We
need to show that γ has at least one of the diagonals in L′.

If γ is contained in L, existence of a diagonal follows from the assumption that L is
ﬂag-no-square. Otherwise, γ has a vertex, say w, which is the cone vertex of one of the
cones, say the cone over a peripheral cycle C, attached to L. We then have that x and z
necessarily belong to C. If y is also a vertex of C, the edge (w, y) is a diagonal of γ. If x is
adjacent to z in C, the edge (x, z) is a diagonal of γ. It remains to consider the last case
when x is not adjacent to z in C and y is not contained in C.

The last case mentioned above has two subcases. In the ﬁrst subcase, suppose that
y is a vertex of L. Then existence of the path (x, y, z) contradicts 3-convexity of C in L,
and hence this subcase is not possible. In the second and last subcase, y has to be the
cone vertex of the cone over a peripheral cycle C ′ of L distinct from C. But then the non-
adjacent vertices x, z belong to the intersection C ∩ C ′, which contradicts the assumption
that such intersection is either empty or a single simplex of L. So this subcase is also not
possible, and hence L′ satisﬁes the ﬂag-no-square condition.

The lemma is now a consequence of nonexistence of ﬂag-no-square triangulations of

spheres Sn+1 for n ≥ 3 (cf. Corollary 5.7 in [PS]).

Lemma 4.9, and the comment right before its statement, suggest the following.

4.10 Question. Given an integer n ≥ 3, does there exist a right-angled Coxeter group W
which is word-hyperbolic and whose Gromov boundary ∂W is an n-dimensional Sierpi´nski
compactum?

5. Local 3-convexity in CAT(0) cubical complexes.

In this section we use the concept of 3-convexity to present some strengthened notion
of convexity (called local 3-convexity) in CAT(0) cubical complexes. We then derive, as
Proposition 5.3 below, some rather strong global geometric property of locally 3-convex
subcomplexes. This property is essential for our arguments in Section 6.

5.1 Deﬁnition (local 3-convexity). A subcomplex Y of a cubical complex X is locally
3-convex if for each vertex v ∈ Y the link Lk(v, Y ) is a 3-convex subcomplex in the
corresponding link Lk(v, X).

Before stating the main result of this section, concerning some global behaviour of

locally 3-convex subcomplexes, we make few preparations.

To each complete convex subspace Y of a CAT(0) space X (in particular, to any convex
subcomplex Y of a CAT(0) cubical complex X) there is associated a map π : X → Y ,
called projection to Y , given by π(x) = y, where y is the unique point of Y closest to x
(cf. Chapter II.2 in [BH]). The following observation will be used later in our arguments.

5.2 Lemma. Let X be a CAT(0) cubical complex and Y its convex subcomplex. Then for
any vertex v of X its projection to Y is also a vertex.
Proof: Supose that π(x) = y, where y ∈ Y is not a vertex. We need to show that x is not
a vertex. Let σ be the cubical face of Y such that y belongs to the interior of σ. Let [x, y]
denote the geodesic in X from x to y. Since y is the point of Y closest to x, there is a face

18

τ in X containing σ and such that the ﬁnal part of [x, y] is contained in τ and orthogonal
to σ.
In particular, there is a pair of opposite codimension 1 faces in τ such that the
part of [x, y] contained in τ is parallel to those two faces, and disjoint with them both.
Then, using induction, we observe that [x, y] satisﬁes the same property with respect to
any cubical face τ ′ of X that it crosses (here we use the fact that [x, y] is the concatenation
of ﬁnitely many segments, each of which is contained in a single cubical face, cf. Corollary
7.29 on p. 110 in [BH]). In particular, it follows that [x, y] omits all vertices of any cubical
face of X that it crosses, and hence x is not a vertex of X. This completes the proof.

We denote by stc(v, X), and call the cubical star of a vertex v in a CAT(0) cubical
complex X, the subcomplex of X equal to the union of all cubical faces of X containg v.

5.3 Proposition. Let X be a CAT(0) cubical complex, and let Y be its convex subcomplex
which is locally 3-convex. Let v be any vertex of X, and denote by u the vertex of Y equal
to the projection of v to Y . Let ρ be any geodesic ray in X started at v and representing
a point ξ ∈ ∂∞Y ⊂ ∂∞X. Then
(a) ρ intersects the subcomplex stc(u, Y );
(b) except for a bounded initial subsegment, ρ is contained in Y .

Proof: The proof is split into several parts, and it occupies the rest of this section.

Thickened hyperplanes and extended half-spaces.

We refer to hyperplanes and half-spaces in CAT(0) cubical complexes, as described
e.g. in [W], Sections 2.4, 3.2 and 3.3. Given any oriented edge e = (p, q) of X, denote by
Je the hyperplane in X dual to e, i.e. the hyperplane orthogonal to e and passing through
the midpoint of e. Denote by He this closed half-space for Je which contains p. Recall
that both Je and He are convex subspaces in X, and that the hyperplane Je is canonically
a CAT(0) cubical complex.

Denote by J ∗

e , and call the thickened hyperplane in X dual to e, the subcomplex of
X being the union of all cubical faces of X intersected by Je. Note that, as a cubical
complex, J ∗
e is isomorphic to the product Je × I, where I is the 1-cube. Moreover, given
any vertex o in J ∗
e , there is a unique edge ε in X containing o and intesecting Je; denoting
by tε the vertex in the link Lk(o, X) induced by ε, we have Lk(o, J ∗
e ) = st(tε, Lk(o, X)). In
particular, Lk(o, J ∗
e ) is a full subcomplex of Lk(o, X), and hence any thickened hyperplane
J ∗
e is a convex subcomplex of X.

Denote by H ∗

equal (as a set) to the union He ∪ J ∗
Lk(s, X) or Lk(s, H ∗
subcomplex of X.

e ) = Lk(s, J ∗

e , and call the extended half-space of X induced by e, the subcomplex
e ) =
e is a convex

e . Since for any vertex s ∈ H ∗

e ), we get that any extended half-space H ∗

e either Lk(s, H ∗

Compare [W], Section 3.3, where extended hyperplanes are called hyperplane carriers,

and extended half-spaces are called halfspace carriers.

The subcomplex P and its basic properties.

Given X, Y , v and u as in the proposition, denote by E Y

in Y with the initial vertex u, and put

u the set of all oriented edges

H ∗
e .

P := \e∈E Y

u

19

Obviously, P is a convex subcomplex of X.
Claim 1. P ∩ Y = stc(u, Y ).

To prove Claim 1, note that for each e ∈ E Y

Y dual to e, we have Je,Y = Je ∩ Y . Similarly, if H ∗
Y induced by e, we have H ∗
e ∩ Y . Consequently, we have
e(cid:19) ∩ Y = \e∈E Y
(He ∩ Y ) = \e∈E Y

P ∩ Y =(cid:18) \e∈E Y

e,Y ,

and the latter intersection obviously coincides with the cubical star stc(u, Y ), thus justi-
fying the claim.
Claim 2. v ∈ P .

Since He ⊂ H ∗

e , to prove Claim 2, it is suﬃcient to show that for each e ∈ E Y

u we have
v ∈ He. To do this, suppose it is not true, i.e. v /∈ He for some e ∈ E Y
u . Since u ∈ He, the
geodesic [v, u] crosses the hyperplane Je. Let z be the point in the intersection [v, u] ∩ Je
closest to u. Consider the geodesic triangle T = ∆(u, m, z), where m is the midpoint of
the edge e. Since z ∈ Je, the angle of T at m equals π/2. Since the side [u, m] of T is
contained in Y , and since u is the projection of z to Y , the angle of T at u is ≥ π/2.
Finally, the angle of T at z is > 0. This contradicts the fact that the sum of angles in any
geodesic triangle in a CAT(0) space is ≤ π, thus completing the proof of Claim 2.
Convexity of Y ∪ P .
To prove that the subcomplex Y ∪ P is convex, observe ﬁrst that it is obviously
connected. It is then suﬃcient to show that for any vertex z ∈ Y ∪ P the link Lk(z, Y ∪ P )
is a full subcomplex in the link Lk(z, X). Obviously, this is true for any vertex z ∈ Y ∪ P
disjoint with the intersection P ∩ Y , by convexity of both P and Y . It remains to check
this property for vertices z ∈ P ∩ Y , i.e. for vertices z ∈ stc(u, Y ), see Claim 1 above.
For z = u we have Lk(u, P ∪ Y ) = Lk(u, X), because stc(u, X) ⊂ P ∪ Y , and hence
the above mentioned property follows trivially. Suppose z ∈ P ∩ Y = stc(u, Y ), and
z 6= u. Let σ be the smallest cubical face of X containing u and z. Let e1, . . . , em be
the edges adjacent to u in σ, oriented so that u is their initial vertex. Obviously, we have
e1, . . . , em ∈ E Y
u . Let d1, . . . , dm be the edges of σ adjacent to z and parallel to e1, . . . , em
respectively. Equip them with the orientations consistent with those of e1, . . . , em, i.e.
such that z is their terminal vertex. Denote by t1, . . . , tm the vertices in Lk(z, X) induced
by the edges d1, . . . , dm respectively. Denote also by τ the simplex of Lk(z, X) spanned by
the vertices t1, . . . , tm (i.e. induced by the face σ). We then have

Lk(z, P ) = Lk(cid:18)z, \e∈E Y

where the last equality follows by an easy observation that for e ∈ E Y
have Lk(z, H ∗

e ) = Lk(z, X). As a consequence, we get

u \ {e1, . . . , em} we

Lk(z, P ∪ Y ) = Lk(z, Y ) ∪ Lk(z, P ) = Lk(z, Y ) ∪ [Lk(z, H ∗

dm )] =

= Lk(z, Y ) ∪ [st(t1, Lk(z, X)) ∩ . . . ∩ st(tm, Lk(z, X))] = Lk(z, Y ) ∪ st(τ, Lk(z, X)).

Since Lk(z, Y ) is 3-convex in Lk(z, X), and since τ ⊂ Lk(z, Y ), it follows from the above
equality and from the second assertion of Lemma 4.2 that Lk(z, P ∪Y ) is a full subcomplex
of Lk(z, X). This completes the proof of convexity of the subcomplex P ∪ Y ⊂ X.
Proof of assertions (a) and (b) of the proposition.

Let ρ be a geodesic ray as in the proposition. If v ∈ Y , assertion (a) is obvious since
u = v, and assertion (b) follows from convexity of Y . So assume that v /∈ Y . By the fact
that Y ∪ P is convex, it makes sense to speak of the subset ∂∞(Y ∪ P ) ⊂ ∂∞X. Since
∂∞Y ⊂ ∂∞(Y ∪ P ), we have ξ ∈ ∂∞(Y ∪ P ), and since v ∈ P ⊂ Y ∪ P , we get that ρ
is contained in Y ∪ P . To prove (a), suppose on the contrary that ρ does not intersect
stc(u, Y ) = P ∩ Y . Since P \ (P ∩ Y ) is open and closed in (P ∪ Y ) \ (P ∩ Y ), and since
v ∈ P \ (P ∩ Y ), the ray ρ must be contained in P \ (P ∩ Y ). Since P ∩ Y is bounded,
it follows that dY ∪P (ρ(t), Y ) = dX(ρ(t), Y ∩ P ) → ∞ as t → ∞. By convexity of Y ∪ P ,
the distances in Y ∪ P are the same as those in X, and hence dX(ρ(t), Y ) → ∞ as t → ∞,
which contradicts the assumption that limt→∞ ρ(t) = ξ ∈ ∂∞Y . Thus assertion (a) follows.
A similar argument shows that, after leaving P ∩ Y , the geodesic ray ρ stays in Y , which
yields assertion (b).

6. Completing the proof of Theorem 1.3.

To prove Theorem 1.3, we consider (under notation and assumptions of this theorem)
an embedding of the visual boundary ∂∞(W, S) in the sphere Sn+1 as described in Section
2. We need to verify that, under this embedding, ∂∞(W, S) satisﬁes conditions (1)–(4)
of Deﬁnition 1.1. Note that conditions (1) and (2) have been already veriﬁed in Section
2 (see Proposition 2.1(2) and Corollary 2.6). It remains to verify conditions (3) and (4),
which we do below, in Propositions 6.1 and 6.4.

Closures of complementary components are pairwise disjoint.

This subsection is devoted to the proof of the following.

either disjoint, or intersect at a single simplex of L;

6.1 Proposition. Let (W, S) be a right-angled Coxeter system whose nerve L is an (n+1)-
sphere with holes, and suppose that the following two conditions hold:
(1) for any two distinct connected components of Sn+1 \ L, their closures in Sn+1 are
(2) the boundary bd(Ω) of any component Ω of Sn+1 \ L is a 3-convex subcomplex of L.
Consider an embedding of the boundary ∂∞(S, W ) in Sn+1, as described in Section 2. Then
the closures of any two distinct connected components of Sn+1 \ ∂∞(W, S) are disjoint.

We use the setting and the notation ﬁxed at the beginning of Section 2. In particular,
∂∞(W, S) = ∂∞Σ is realized as a subspace of Sn+1 = ∂∞Σ′ = ∂∞(W ′, S′), for appropriate
choice of the nerve L′ ⊃ L. By Lemma 2.5, connected components of Sn+1 \ ∂∞(W, S) =

21

∂∞Σ′ \ ∂∞Σ are parametrized by the pairs (C, ¯w) : C ∈ Per(L, L′), ¯w ∈ W/WC and have
form

U = UC, ¯w = ∂∞Σ′ \ ∂∞( ¯w · H +

C ) = ∂∞( ¯w · H −

C ) \ ∂∞( ¯w · ΣC).

The topological boundary bd(U ) coincides then with the set ∂∞( ¯w · ΣC). Thus, to prove
Proposition 6.1, it is suﬃcient to show the following.

6.2 Lemma. Under assumptions of Proposition 6.1, if (C1, ¯w1), (C2, ¯w2) are distinct pairs
such that Ci ∈ Per(L,L’) and ¯wi ∈ W/WCi then the sets ∂∞( ¯w1 · ΣC1 ) and ∂∞( ¯w2 · ΣC2 )
are disjoint (as subsets of ∂∞Σ).

Proof: We will need the following.
Claim. If the intersection ¯w1 · ΣC1 ∩ ¯w2 · ΣC2 is not empty then it consists of a single
cubical cell of the complex Σ.

To prove the claim, we refer here to the combinatorial description of the Coxeter-
Davis complex Σ, as a cubical complex, given in [Da], Chapter 7, Section 7.3.
In this
description, the cubical cells of Σ are in 1-1 correspondence with the cosets of ﬁnite special
subgroups of W , and in particular the vertices of Σ are in 1-1 correspondence with W .
For any C ∈ Per(L, L′) and any ¯w = w · WC ∈ W/WC, the vertex set of the subcomplex
¯w · ΣC can be identiﬁed with the subset w · WC ⊂ W . Obviously, if C1 = C2 = C and
¯w1 = w1·WC 6= ¯w2 = w2·WC then the subsets w1·WC1 and w2·WC2 are disjoint. It follows
that under assumption of the claim we have C1 6= C2. Now, since ¯w1 · ΣC1 ∩ ¯w2 · ΣC2 6= ∅,
there is a vertex w ∈ W which belongs to this intersection. We then have ¯w1·ΣC1 = w·ΣC1
and ¯w2 · ΣC2 = w · ΣC2 . Consequently, by invariance under W , to prove the claim it is
suﬃcient to show that the intersection ΣC1 ∩ ΣC2 is a single cell. The vertex sets of the
subcomplexes ΣC1 and ΣC2 correspond to the subgroups WC1 , WC2 < W , respectively.
Obviously, we have WC1 ∩ WC2 = WC1∩C2 , where W∅ denotes the trivial subgroup. By the
assumption (1) of Proposition 6.1, C1 ∩ C2 is either empty, or a single simplex of L. The
special subgroup WC1∩C2 is then ﬁnite. As a consequence, the intersection ΣC1 ∩ ΣC2 is
exactly the cell of Σ corresponding to the subgroup WC1∩C2 viewed as a coset of a ﬁnite
special subgroup in W , hence the claim.

To conclude the proof of Lemma 6.2, consider any two points ξ1, ξ2 belonging to the
sets ∂∞( ¯w1·ΣC1 ) and ∂∞( ¯w2·ΣC2 ), respectively. Fix any vertex v of Σ, and denote by ρ1, ρ2
the geodesic rays in Σ started at v and representing the points ξ1, ξ2 respectively. Note that
for any vertex u of any subcomplex ¯wi·ΣCi the pair of vertex links (Lk(u, Σ), Lk(u, ¯wi·ΣCi)
is isomorphic (as a pair of simplicial complexes) to the pair (L, Ci). By assumption (2) of
Proposition 6.1, it follows that each ¯wi · ΣCi is a convex and locally 3-convex subcomplex
of Σ. Applying Proposition 5.3(b), we get that each of the rays ρi, except for a ﬁnite
subsegment, is contained in the corresponding subcomplex ¯wi · ΣCi . In view of the claim,
this implies that ρ1 6= ρ2, and consequently ξ1 6= ξ2, hence the lemma.

By what was said above, this also concludes the proof of Proposition 6.1.

Natural metrics on the visual boundary of a CAT(0) space.

In this subsection we describe a family of natural metrics (compatible with the cone
(A metric of

topology) on the visual boundary ∂∞X of a complete CAT(0) space X.

22

this form will be used in the argument in the next subsection.) Recall that in a complete
CAT(0) space any point x0 ∈ X can be connected to any ξ ∈ ∂∞X with the unique
geodesic ray (see [BH], Chapter II, Proposition 8.19). Recall also that for distinct geodesic
rays r, r′ based at a common point of X the function t → dX (r(t), r′(t)) is convex (see
[BH], Chapter II, Proposition 2.2), and hence for any real A > 0 there is exactly one t with
dX (r(t), r′(t)) = A. The following fact was observed by Damian Osajda, see Proposition
9.6(1) in [OS].
6.3 Lemma. Let X be a complete CAT(0) space, x0 ∈ X a point, and A > 0 a real
number. For ξ, η ∈ ∂∞X, ξ 6= η, let rξ, rη be the unique geodesic rays from x0 to ξ and η,
respectively. Put dA(ξ, η) := t−1, where t is the unique number with dX(rξ(t), rη(t)) = A.
Then dA is a metric on ∂∞X compatible with the cone topology.

The family of complementary components is null.

The last missing element in the proof of Theorem 1.3 is the following.

either disjoint, or intersect at a single simplex of L;

6.4 Proposition. Let (W, S) be a right-angled Coxeter system whose nerve L is an (n+1)-
sphere with holes, and suppose that the following two conditions hold:
(1) for any two distinct connected components of Sn+1 \ L, their closures in Sn+1 are
(2) the boundary bd(Ω) of any component Ω of Sn+1 \ L is a 3-convex subcomplex of L.
Consider an embedding of the boundary ∂∞(S, W ) in Sn+1, as described in Section 2. Then
the family of connected components of Sn+1 \ ∂∞(W, S) is null.
Proof: We come back to the notation introduced at the beginning of Section 2. Note
that, in view of Corollary 2.6, the family of closures of the connected components of
Sn+1 \ ∂∞(W, S) coincides with the family

C ) : C ∈ Per(L, L′), ¯w ∈ W/WC.
Obviously, it is then suﬃcient to show that this last family is null.

∂∞( ¯w · H −

Order the family of all half-spaces in Σ′ of form ¯w · H −

C as above into a sequence
(Hk)k≥1, and recall that these half-spaces are all convex. Fix any vertex v0 ∈ Σ′, and for
each k ≥ 1 denote by uk the projection of v0 to Hk (which is a vertex, by Lemma 5.2).
Claim 1. Put tk = dΣ′(v0, uk). Then limk→∞ tk = ∞.

To prove Claim 1, note that each half-space Hk is the union of a collection of (n + 2)-
cubes of Σ′, and that two diﬀerent half-spaces Hk have no such (n + 2)-cube in common.
The claim follows then from uniform ﬁniteness of Σ′.

Claim 2. Each half-space Hk is a convex and locally 3-convex subcomplex of Σ′.

To prove Claim 2, we only need to check that Hk is locally 3-convex in Σ′. Assume
without loss of generality that Hk = ¯w · H −
C , and put Σk = ¯w · ΣC. Obviously, if v is a
vertex of Hk not belonging to Σk then the link Lk(v, Hk) coincides with the link Lk(v, Σ′).
If v ∈ Σk then the pair (Lk(v, Σ′), Lk(v, Hk)) is isomorphic to the pair (L′, Ω), where Ω is
the subcomplex of L′ equal to the closure of the connected component of L′\L bounded by

23

C. Thus, in order to prove the claim, we need to show that the subcomplex Ω is 3-convex
in L′.

To prove the latter statement, note ﬁrst that since C is a full subcomplex of L′, the
same is true for Ω. To get 3-convexity of Ω, consider any combinatorial geodesic (x, y, z)
in the 1-skeleton of L′, with x and z belonging to Ω. We need to show that y belongs to
Ω. This is obviously true if some of the vertices x, z does not lie on the boundary cycle C.
So we may assume that both x and z are in C. If y is a vertex of L, it must belong to C,
and hence to Ω, by 3-convexity of C in L. If y is not in L, it belongs to some component
′
Ω′ of the complement L′ \ L. It follows that both x and z belong then to the closure Ω
.
Since x and z are not adjacent, condition (1) of the proposition implies that Ω′ = Ω, and
hence again y ∈ Ω. This completes the proof of Claim 2.

To conclude the proof of Proposition 6.4, we now pass to estimating the diameter of
the subset ∂∞Hk with respect to some metric dA in ∂∞Σ′ = Sn+1. More precisely, put
A = 2√n + 2, and consider the metric dA in ∂∞Σ′ as described in Lemma 6.3, for the
base point v0. Let ξ, η be any points of ∂∞Hk, and let rξ, rη be the geodesic rays in Σ′,
started at v0, and representing points ξ, η respectively. In view of Claim 2, Proposition
5.3(a) implies that rξ, rη pass through the cubical star stc(uk, Hk). Since obviously for
each k ≥ 1 the diameter of the cubical star stc(uk, Hk) is bounded above by A, and since
the distance from v0 to Hk is equal to tk, we get that dΣ′(rξ(tk), rη(tk)) ≤ A, and hence
dA(ξ, η) ≤ 1/tk. This means that for the metric dA we have diam(Hk) ≤ 1/tk. The
proposition follows then by Claim 1.
