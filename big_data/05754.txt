ABSTRACT

We have measured the sky-projected spin-orbit alignments for three transiting Hot Jupiters, WASP-
103b, WASP-87b, and WASP-66b, using spectroscopic measurements of the Rossiter-McLaughlin
eﬀect, with the CYCLOPS2 optical-ﬁber bundle system feeding the UCLES spectrograph on the
Anglo-Australian Telescope. The resulting sky projected spin-orbit angles of λ = 3◦ ± 33◦, λ =
−8◦ ± 11◦, and λ = −4◦ ± 22◦ for WASP-103b, WASP-87b, and WASP-66b, respectively, suggest
that these three planets are likely on nearly aligned orbits with respect to their host star’s spin axis.
WASP-103 is a particularly interesting system as its orbital distance is only 20% larger than its host
star’s Roche radius and the planet likely experiences strong tidal eﬀects. WASP-87 and WASP-66 are
hot (Tef f = 6450 ± 120 K and Tef f = 6600 ± 150 K, respectively) mid-F stars making them similar
to the majority of stars hosting planets on high obliquity orbits. Moderate spin-orbit misalignments
for WASP-103b and WASP-66b are consistent with our data, but polar and retrograde orbits are not
favored for these systems.

WASP-87 & WASP-66) — techniques: radial velocities

1. INTRODUCTION

Measurements of the projected obliquity (i.e., sky-
projected angle between planetary orbits and their host
star’s spin axis) of exoplanetary systems are key to un-
derstanding the various mechanisms involved in the for-
mation and migration of extrasolar planets (Albrecht
et al. 2012b, e.g.,). Ninety-one exoplanetary systems5,
including WASP-66, WASP-87, and WASP-103 as re-
ported here, have measured projected obliquities, as of
2015 November. These measurements have revealed a
stunning diversity of planetary orbits that includes 36
planets on signiﬁcantly misaligned orbits (|λ| > 22.5◦),
15 of which are on nearly polar orbits (67.5◦ < |λ| <
112.5◦ or 247.5◦ < |λ| < 292.5◦), and nine are on retro-
grade orbits (112.5◦ ≤ |λ| ≤ 247.5◦). The vast major-
ity of reported spin-orbit alignments come from spectro-
scopic measurements of the Rossiter-McLaughlin eﬀect
(e.g., Rossiter 1924; McLaughlin 1924; Queloz et al. 2000;
Ohta et al. 2005), a radial velocity anomaly produced
during planetary transits from the rotationally broad-
ened stellar line proﬁles of a star being asymmetrically
distorted when speciﬁc regions of the stellar disk are oc-
culted by a transiting planet.

Hot Jupiters orbiting stars cooler than 6250 K have
been observed to be generally in spin-orbit alignment,

while hotter stars are seen to host high obliquity systems,
as noted by Winn et al. (2010a), Albrecht et al. (2012b),
& others. The reason for this observed dichotomy is
thought to be linked to the amount of mass in the stel-
lar convective envelope, which acts to tidally dampen
orbital obliquities. Therefore, the realignment timescale
for planets is believed to be correlated with the stellar
convective envelope mass. Cooler stars have a thicker
convective envelope than hotter stars (as supported by
stellar interior models, see, Pinsonneault et al. 2001) and
can thus drive planets that are on highly misaligned or-
bits onto low obliquity orbits more quickly. Albrecht
et al. (2012b) proposes that the mechanism(s) responsi-
ble for migrating giant planets into short period orbits
are also randomly misaligning their orbits. Stars with
Tef f > 6250 K can only weakly dampen orbital obliq-
uities and are thus unable to realign planetary orbits.
Therefore, the Albrecht et al. (2012b) model predicts
stars with Tef f > 6250 K should be observed to host
planets on a random distribution of orbital obliquities
while cooler stars should host planets on nearly aligned
orbits.

An expansion of the parameter space for which spin-
orbit angles are measured will be important for testing
whether these observed trends continue to hold and so
test models for orbital migration. In particular, obliquity
measurements need to be carried out for suitable sys-
tems that belong to the least explored parameter space,
which includes sub-Jovian, long-period, and multi-planet
systems. Several mechanisms have been proposed for
producing Hot Jupiters and misaligning their orbits and
these can generally be grouped into two categories: disk
migration and high eccentricity migration. Disk migra-
tion occurs through the interactions between a planet
and its surrounding proto-planetary disk (e.g., see, Ward
1997). Migration through this process leads to the pro-
duction of short period planets on well-aligned orbits

2

Addison et al.

(Bate et al. 2010), therefore, this mechanism is disfavored
for producing the observed population of Hot Jupiters
on high obliquity orbits. High eccentricity migration
through either Kozai-Lidov resonances (Kozai 1962; Li-
dov 1962; Fabrycky & Tremaine 2007), planet-planet
scatterings (Chatterjee et al. 2008), secular chaos (Wu
& Lithwick 2011), or some combination of these mecha-
nisms appears to be the likely route for producing mis-
aligned Hot Jupiters.

To further expand the sample of planets with spin-
orbit alignment measurements, we have observed the
Rossiter-McLaughlin eﬀect for WASP-66b, WASP-87b,
and WASP-103b, three recently discovered Hot Jupiter
planets from the Wide Angle Search for Planets (see, Hel-
lier et al. 2012; Anderson et al. 2014; Gillon et al. 2014).
These systems were predicted to have large observable
velocity anomalies and were good candidates for follow-
up observations to determine their orbital obliquities.

WASP-103 is a late F star with a mass of M(cid:63) =
1.220+0.039
−0.031 R(cid:12), eﬀective
temperature of Tef f = 6110 ± 160 K, and has moder-
ate rotation (v sin i(cid:63) = 10.6 ± 0.9 kms−1) as reported by

Gillon et al. (2014).
MP = 1.490 ± 0.088 MJ , moderately inﬂated with a ra-
dius of RP = 1.528+0.073
−0.041 RJ , and an orbital period of
just P = 0.925542 ± 0.000019 day (Gillon et al. 2014).

WASP-103 is a particularly interesting system as it
consists of a Hot Jupiter that is orbiting at only 1.2 times
the Roche radius of the host star and 1.5 times its stel-
lar diameter (Gillon et al. 2014). The planet likely ex-
periences strong tidal forces that cause signiﬁcant mass
loss with Roche-lobe overﬂow and is very near the edge
of being tidally disrupted. Measuring the spin-orbit an-
gle for this system could potentially oﬀer insights into
the processes involved in the migration of WASP-103b
to its current ultra-short-period orbit. This planet cur-
rently has the second shortest orbital period of all plan-
etary systems with reported spin-orbit angle measure-
ments (WASP-19b has the shortest orbital period with
a measured obliquity, Hellier et al. 2011; Albrecht et al.
2012b; Tregloan-Reed et al. 2013).
WASP-87 is a mid-F star with a mass of M(cid:63) = 1.204±
0.093 M(cid:12), radius of R(cid:63) = 1.627±0.062 R(cid:12), eﬀective tem-
perature of Tef f = 6450 ± 120 K, and rotating with a
v sin i(cid:63) = 9.6 ± 0.7 kms−1 as reported in Anderson et al.
(2014).
It hosts a giant planet with a mass of MP =
2.18 ± 0.15 MJ , with a radius of RP = 1.385 ± 0.060 RJ ,
and an orbital period of P = 1.6827950 ± 0.0000019 day
(Anderson et al. 2014). A possible bound early-G stel-
lar companion was observed 8.2" from WASP-87 by An-
derson et al. (2014). WASP-87 was predicted to be a
good candidate for follow-up Rossiter-McLaughlin obser-
vations due to the high v sin i(cid:63) and large RP .
WASP-66 is a mid-F star with a mass of M(cid:63) =
1.30 ± 0.07 M(cid:12), radius of R(cid:63) = 1.75 ± 0.09 R(cid:12), eﬀec-
tive temperature of Tef f = 6600 ± 150 K, and rotat-
ing with a v sin i(cid:63) = 13.4 ± 0.9 kms−1 as reported in
It hosts a massive planet with a
Hellier et al. (2012).
mass of MP = 2.32 ± 0.13 MJ , slightly inﬂated with a
radius of RP = 1.39 ± 0.09 RJ , and an orbital period of
P = 4.086052±0.000007 day (Hellier et al. 2012). WASP-
66 was also predicted to be a good candidate for follow-up
Rossiter-McLaughlin observations.

2. OBSERVATIONS

We carried out the spectroscopic observations of
WASP-103b, WASP-87b, and WASP-66b using the CY-
CLOPS2 ﬁber feed with the UCLES spectrograph on
the Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT). The instrumen-
tal set-up and observing strategy for both transit ob-
servations closely followed that presented in our previ-
ous Rossiter-McLaughlin publications (i.e., WASP-79b
and HATS-3b, Addison et al. 2013, 2014a). We used
a thorium-argon calibration lamp (ThAr), to illumi-
nate all on-sky ﬁbers, and a thorium-uranium-xenon
lamp (ThUXe), to illuminate the simultaneous calibra-
tion ﬁber, for calibrating the observations. We provide a
summary of the observations in Tables 1 & 2.

2.1. Spectroscopic Observations of WASP-103b

Spectroscopic transit observations of WASP-103b were
obtained on the night of 2014 May 22, starting ∼ 50 min
before ingress and ﬁnishing ∼ 15 min after egress. A total
of 13 spectra were obtained on that night (seven during
the ∼ 2.5 hr transit) in good observing conditions for Sid-
ing Spring Observatory with seeing between 0.7" to 1.1"
and some patchy clouds. WASP-103 was observed at an
airmass of 1.3 for the ﬁrst exposure, 1.5 near mid-transit,
and 2.4 at the end of the observations. A S/N = 29 per
2.5 pixel resolution element at λ = 5490 ˚A (in total over
all 16 ﬁbers) was obtained at an airmass of 1.3, 0.8" see-
ing, and integration times of 1000 s.

We also obtained two out-of-transit observations of
WASP-103b on the previous night (May 21) and at-
tempted to use them to determine the radial velocity

oﬀset between our data set and the Gillon et al. (2014)
data set. Observing conditions on this night were good
with seeing ∼ 1.0" and clear skies. A S/N = 28 per 2.5
pixel resolution element at λ = 5490 ˚A (in total over all
16 ﬁbers) was obtained for WASP-103 when observed at
an airmass of 1.3.

2.2. Spectroscopic Observations of WASP-87b

We observed WASP-87b on the night of 2015 February
28, starting 70 min before ingress and ﬁnishing 80 min
after egress. A total of 17 spectra were obtained on that
night (including nine during the ∼ 3 hr transit) in good
observing conditions with seeing between 0.9" to 1.3".
WASP-87 was observed at an airmass of 1.8 for the ﬁrst
exposure, 1.20 near mid-transit, and 1.1 at the end of the
observations.

2.3. Spectroscopic Observations of WASP-66b

We obtained transit observations of WASP-66b on the
night of 2014 March 21, starting ∼ 30 min before ingress
and ﬁnishing ∼ 20 min after egress (see Table 2 for a sum-
mary of these observations). A total of 15 spectra with
an exposure time of 1200 s were obtained on that night
(11 during the ∼ 4.5 hr transit) in good observing con-
ditions with seeing ∼ 1.2" and some patchy clouds. The
airmass at which WASP-66 was observed varied from 1.0
for the ﬁrst exposure, 1.1 near mid-transit, and 2.2 at the
end of the observations. A S/N = 39 per 2.5 pixel reso-
lution element at λ = 5490 ˚A (in total over all 16 ﬁbers)
was obtained at an airmass of 1.0 and in 1.2" seeing.

2.4. Independent Determination of Stellar Rotational

Velocity

We determined the stellar rotational velocity for
WASP-103 and WASP-66 independently of the Rossiter-
McLaughlin eﬀect by ﬁtting a rotationally broadened
Gaussian to a least-squares deconvolution line proﬁle for
every spectral order (as done in Addison et al. 2013,
2014a) of the two best spectra of WASP-103 and WASP-
66. For WASP-103, v sin i(cid:63) = 8.8 ± 0.7 kms−1, and
for WASP-66, v sin i(cid:63) = 11.8 ± 0.4 kms−1. v sin i(cid:63) de-
termined from the Rossiter-McLaughlin eﬀect for these
two systems (as presented in § 4) is consistent with
the values determined from the least-squares deconvolu-
tion method, but with signiﬁcantly larger uncertainties.
v sin i(cid:63) as reported in Gillon et al. (2014) and Hellier et al.
(2012) for WASP-103 and WASP-66, respectively, are
inconsistent with the values determined from the least-
squares deconvolution method. Gillon et al. (2014) did
not specify the method they used to derive the v sin i(cid:63)
value of WASP-103. Hellier et al. (2012) and Anderson
et al. (2014) determined v sin i(cid:63) values of WASP-66 and
WASP-87, respectively, by ﬁtting several unblended Fe I
line proﬁles.

3. ROSSITER-MCLAUGHLIN ANALYSIS

Spectroscopic data were reduced by tracing each ﬁber
and optimally extracting each spectral order using cus-
tom MATLAB routines developed by the authors (see
Addison et al. 2013, 2014a). For WASP-103 and WASP-
66, each of the 15 useful ﬁbers, in each of the 17 use-
ful orders, are used to estimate a radial velocity (and

associated uncertainty) by cross-correlation with a spec-
trum of a bright template star, HD 157347, of similar
spectral type to the targets, using the IRAF task, fx-
cor, as described in Addison et al. (2013, 2014a). For
WASP-87, we found the best radial velocities were pro-
duced by cross-correlation of each of the 15 useful ﬁbers,
in each of the 17 useful orders with a 5000 K synthetic
template star. A variety of templates were trialed for
cross-correlation, including observations of other bright
template stars (such as HD 10700, HD 206395, and HD
86264), as well as synthetic spectra of F and G type
stars. The lowest inter-ﬁder6 velocity scatter was ob-
tained using the spectrum of HD 157347 for WASP-
103 and WASP-66. The weighted average velocities for
each observation were computed and the uncertainties for
each weighted velocity were estimated from the weighted
standard deviation of the ﬁder velocity scatter. The
weighted radial velocities for the WASP-103, WASP-87,
and WASP-66 transit observations, including their un-
certainties and total S/N, are given in Tables 3 and 5,
respectively.

The Exoplanetary Orbital Simulation and Analysis
Model (ExOSAM, see Addison et al. 2013, 2014a) was
used to determine the best ﬁt λ and v sin i(cid:63) values
for WASP-103, WASP-87, and WASP-66 from Rossiter-
McLaughlin eﬀect measurements. We have imple-
mented a Metropolis-Hastings Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) algorithm in ExOSAM that replaces the
Monte Carlo model used in Addison et al. (2014a) to
derive accurate posterior probability distributions of λ
and v sin i(cid:63) and to opitmize their ﬁt to the radial veloc-
ity data. Our MCMC procedure largely follows from
Collier Cameron et al. (2007) and is outlined as fol-
lows. There are 16 input parameters used to model the
Rossiter-McLaughlin eﬀect for these three systems, of
which 14 are prior values given by Gillon et al. (2014)
for WASP-103, Anderson et al. (2014) for WASP-87, and
Hellier et al. (2012) for WASP-66. The 14 priors are: the
planet-to-star radius ratio (Rp/R(cid:63)); the orbital inclina-
tion angle (I); the orbital period (P ); the mid-transit
time (T0) at the epoch of observation; a radial velocity
oﬀset (Vd) between the AAT data sets presented here and
previously published data sets; a velocity oﬀset term (Vs)
accounting for systematic eﬀects between the AAT data
sets taken over multiple nights; planet-to-star mass ratio
(Mp/M(cid:63)); orbital eccentricity (e); argument of perias-
tron (); two adopted quadratic limb-darkening coeﬃ-
cients (q1 and q2); the micro-turbulence velocity (ξt); the
macro-turbulence velocity (vmac); and the center-of-mass
velocity (VTP ) at published epoch TP .

We ﬁxed q1 and q2, ξt, vmac, and VTP to their literature
values. All three planets are also consistent with being
on circular orbits so we ﬁxed e = 0 and  = 0. The
two out-of-transit observations obtained on 2014 May 21
for WASP-103 could not be reliably used in constrain-
ing Vd between our data and Gillon et al. (2014) data.
This was due to systematic velocity oﬀsets between the
two nights that could not be well characterized from the
small number of out-of-transit radial velocities that were
obtained. We discarded the two observations from May
21 and determined Vd using the six out-of-transit radial

ﬁber in a single spectral order in the echellogram.

Addison et al.

velocities taken on the night of the transit. Therefore,
the velocity diﬀerence, Vs, between the May 21 and 22
data sets was not used in modeling the velocity anomaly.
For WASP-66 and WASP-87, Vs was not used in model-
ing the velocity anomaly since the objects were observed
only on one night.

We assumed Gaussian distributions for the other six
priors (Rp/R(cid:63), I, P , T0, Vd, and Mp/M(cid:63)) and allowed
them to perform a random walk in the MCMC. Values for
these parameters are randomly drawn from a Gaussian
distribution centered on the previously accepted MCMC
iteration and their reported 1σ uncertainties, as given in
Tables 6, 7, and 8 for WASP-103, WASP-87, and WASP-
66, respectively, as described by Equations 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
& 6. The 1σ prior uncertainties remained ﬁxed in the
MCMC, but are multiplied by the scale factor f , an adap-
tive step-size controller that evolves with the estimated
uncertainties for the proposal parameters λ and v sin i(cid:63)
as described below.

Rp/R(cid:63)i = Rp/R(cid:63)i−1 + σRp/R(cid:63) G(0, 1)f

Ii = Ii−1 + σI G(0, 1)f

Pi = Pi−1 + σP G(0, 1)f

T0i = T0i−1 + σT0G(0, 1)f

Vdi = Vdi−1 + σVd G(0, 1)f

(4)

(5)

Mp/M(cid:63)i = Mp/M(cid:63)i−1 + σMp/M(cid:63) G(0, 1)f

(6)
Where i is the current iteration and i− 1 is previously
accepted MCMC iteration, σRp/R(cid:63) is the standard devi-
ation on Rp/R(cid:63), σI is the standard deviation on I, σP is
the standard deviation on P , σT0 is the standard devia-
tion on T0, σVd is the standard deviation on Vd, σMp/M(cid:63)
is the standard deviation on Mp/M(cid:63), G(0, 1) is a random
Gaussian deviate of mean zero and standard deviation of
unity, and f is an adaptable scale factor that is used to
ensure that the acceptance rate is maintained close to the
optimal value of 25% (see, Tegmark et al. 2004; Collier
Cameron et al. 2007).

λ and v sin i(cid:63) represent our proposal parameters for
describing the Rossiter-McLaughlin eﬀect. They perform
a random walk through the parameter space that maps
out the joint posterior probability distribution by the
generation of a cloud of points. A value is drawn for λ
and v sin i(cid:63) at each MCMC iteration (i) by perturbing the
previously accepted proposal values by a small random
amount as described by Equations 7 & 8.

λi = λi−1 + σλG(0, 1)f

v sin i(cid:63),i = v sin i(cid:63),i−1 + σv sin i(cid:63) G(0, 1)f

(7)

(8)

Where σλ is the standard deviation on λ and σv sin i(cid:63)

is the standard deviation on v sin i(cid:63).

We initially set f = 0.5, but allow it to evolve in con-
junction with the estimated proposal uncertainties. Fol-
lowing the procedure of Collier Cameron et al. (2007), we

adjust f and update the uncertainties for λ and v sin i(cid:63)
from the Markov chains themselves on every 100th ac-
cepted MCMC iteration. The reason for allowing the
λ and v sin i(cid:63) uncertainties to evolve with f is to en-
sure that their step sizes are suﬃcient for the adequate
exploration of the parameter space. The simple linear
algorithm fnew = 400fold/NT is used to determine f ,
where NT is the number of trailed proposals during the
previous 100 successful iterations.

The best ﬁt values and conﬁdence intervals for λ and
v sin i(cid:63) are determined from calculating the joint poste-
rior probability distribution, given as the following:

P(Rp/R(cid:63), I, P, T0, Vd, Mp/M(cid:63), λ, v sin i(cid:63))

P(D | λ, v sin i(cid:63), Rp/R(cid:63), I, P, T0, Vd, Mp/M(cid:63))
= exp(−χ2/2)

(9)
Where P(Rp/R(cid:63), I, P, T0, Vd, Mp/M(cid:63), λ, v sin i(cid:63)) and
P(D | λ, v sin i(cid:63), Rp/R(cid:63), I, P, T0, Vd, Mp/M(cid:63)) are the
prior probability distribution and the likelihood of ob-
taining the observed data D given the model M , respec-
tively. χ2 is calculated as:

Where i is the ith accepted proposal, ND is the number
of radial velocities D being ﬁtted to the model M , and
n is the nth radial velocity datum.

To determine the best ﬁt λ for WASP-103, WASP-
87, and WASP-66, we imposed a weak prior on v sin i(cid:63)
and assume a ﬂat prior on λ. This was done by set-
ting the prior to the v sin i(cid:63) value determined from the
least-squares deconvolution method for WASP-103 and
WASP-66 (see Section 2.4) and the value determined
spectroscopically by Anderson et al. (2014) for WASP-
87, using the 2σv sin i(cid:63) as the uncertainty for v sin i(cid:63).
The decision to impose a weak prior on v sin i(cid:63) for these
three systems was based on reducing the potential bias
on λ from the large radial velocity uncertainties, inade-
quate sampling of the Rossiter-McLaughlin eﬀect during
their transits, and the strong correlations between λ and
v sin i(cid:63) from the small impact parameter.

The decision as to whether to accept or reject a given
set of proposals is made by the Metropolis-Hastings rule
(Collier Cameron et al. 2007). This rule states that if

Qi ≤ Qi−1, then the new proposal values are accepted;
otherwise if Qi > Qi−1, then the proposals are accepted
with probability exp(−∆Q/2), where ∆Q ≡ Qi − Qi−1
and Qi = χ2
i . The algorithm ﬁrst converges to the op-
timal solution and then explores the parameter space
around it.

The optimal solutions of λ and v sin i(cid:63) for WASP-103,
WASP-87, and WASP-66 were computed from the mean
of the MCMC chains. Likewise, σλ and σv sin i(cid:63) are com-
puted from the standard deviation of their mean. We
obtained suﬃcient convergence and well-mixing of the
Markov chains from 10,000 accepted MCMC iteration
with no ‘burn-in’ period. Burn-in is a colloquial term
that describes the process in which a certain number of
iterations at the start of a MCMC run are discarded and
the rest are kept for calculating the best ﬁt parameters
and conﬁdence intervals. Geyer (2011) has suggested this
procedure is mostly unnecessary as long as the Markov
chain is started reasonably close to the equilibrium dis-
tribution (determined from preliminary MCMC runs or
some prior knowledge of the distribution). Therefore,
we follow the advice of Geyer (2011) by not applying a
burn-in phase in ExOSAM.

locities over-plotted.

The posterior probability distribution for λ and v sin i(cid:63)
resulting from our MCMC simulations are shown in Fig-
ure 2. The 1σ and 2σ conﬁdence contours are plotted,
along with normalized density functions marginalized
over λ and v sin i(cid:63) with ﬁtted Gaussians. A non-Gaussian
distribution for λ and v sin i(cid:63) is observed, suggesting
that the parameters are correlated with each other or
with other input parameters. λ and v sin i(cid:63) are typically
degenerate when the transit impact parameter is small
(b ≤ 0.25).
The Rossiter-McLaughlin eﬀect is seen as a positive
anomaly between ∼ 80 minutes prior to mid-transit and
mid-transit and then as a negative anomaly between mid-
transit and ∼ 80 minutes after mid-transit. This indi-
cates that the planet ﬁrst transits across the blue-shifted
hemisphere during ingress and then across the red-shifted
hemisphere during egress, producing a nearly symmetri-
cal velocity anomaly as shown in Figure 1. Therefore, the
orbit of WASP-103b is nearly aligned with the spin-axis
of its host star (i.e., that is the system is in “spin-orbit
alignment”).
A projected obliquity of λ = 3◦ ± 33◦ and a v sin i(cid:63) =
6.5±2.0 kms−1 was obtained for this system. The v sin i(cid:63)
measured from the Rossiter-McLaughlin eﬀect is anoma-
lously low compared to the value determined from the
least-squares deconvolution method (8.8 ± 0.7 kms−1)
and reported by Gillon et al. (2014) as 10.6± 0.9 kms−1.
Additional radial velocities covering the WASP-103b
transit are needed in order to obtain a more precise spin-
orbit angle.

non-Gaussian and suggest that there are some correlations between
λ and v sin i(cid:63).

3.2. WASP-87 Results

We determined the best-ﬁt projected obliquity and
v sin i(cid:63) for WASP-87b as λ = −8◦ ± 11◦ and v sin i(cid:63) =
9.8 ± 0.6 kms−1 (using a prior on v sin i(cid:63)), respec-
tively, as given in Table 7.
The v sin i(cid:63) measured
from the Rossiter-McLaughlin eﬀect is in agreement
with the value reported by Anderson et al. (2014) of
9.6 ± 0.7 kms−1 ˙Figure 3 shows the modeled Rossiter-
McLaughlin anomaly with the observed velocities over-
plotted.

This system appears to be well-aligned as shown by
the nearly symmetrical velocity anomaly in Figure 3 and
moderate misalignments (λ ≥ 22.5◦) can be ruled out
by > 2σ. The Rossiter-McLaughlin eﬀect is seen as a
positive anomaly between ∼ 100 minutes prior to mid-
transit and mid-transit and then as a negative anomaly
between mid-transit and ∼ 100 minutes after mid-transit.
The posterior probability distribution for λ and v sin i(cid:63)
resulting from our MCMC simulations are shown in Fig-
ure 4. The 1σ and 2σ conﬁdence contours are plot-
ted, along with normalized density functions marginal-
ized over λ and v sin i(cid:63) with ﬁtted Gaussians.

3.3. WASP-66 Results

Table 8 presents the best-ﬁt parameters and their 1σ
uncertainties for WASP-66. The best-ﬁt solution for
λ is λ = −4◦ ± 22◦ and v sin i(cid:63) = 12.1 ± 2.2 kms−1.
The v sin i(cid:63) measured from the Rossiter-McLaughlin ef-
fect is consistent (to within the measured uncertain-
ties) with the value reported by Hellier et al. (2012) of
13.4 ± 0.9 kms−1 and the value we determined using the

Figure 5. Spectroscopic radial velocities of the WASP-66 taken
just before, during, and after the transit. These are plotted as a
function of time (minutes from mid-transit at 2456738.13445 HJD)
along with the best ﬁtting model and corresponding residuals. The
ﬁlled blue circles with red error bars are radial velocities obtained in
this work on 2014 March 21. The zero velocity oﬀset for our dataset
was determined from the Hellier et al. (2012) out-of-transit radial
velocities (not shown). The velocities appear to be anomalously
below the best ﬁt model of the Rossiter-McLaughlin eﬀect during
the ﬁrst half of the transit. The cause for this is unknown but might
be due to the planet transiting over a star spot, random noise in
the data, or systematic eﬀects that have not been accounted for in
producing the radial velocities.

least-squares deconvolution method (11.8 ± 0.4 kms−1).
High obliquity orbits can be ruled from our data, but ad-
ditional radial velocities covering the WASP-66b transit
are needed to lock down a more precise spin-orbit an-
gle. A modeled Rossiter-McLaughlin anomaly with the
observed velocities over-plotted is shown in Figure 5.

Figure 6 shows the resulting posterior probability dis-
tribution of λ and v sin i(cid:63), including the locations of the
1σ and 2σ conﬁdence contours, for WASP-66 from the
MCMC simulations. We have also produced normalized
density functions, marginalized over λ and v sin i(cid:63) and
with ﬁtted Gaussians, as shown in Figure 6. The result-
ing distribution for λ and v sin i(cid:63) appears to be Gaus-
sian, indicating that these parameters are mostly uncor-
related.

Similar to WASP-103b and WASP-87b, the observed
Rossiter-McLaughlin eﬀect for WASP-66b is seen as a
positive anomaly between ∼ 140 minutes prior to mid-
transit and mid-transit and then as a negative anomaly
between mid-transit and ∼ 140 minutes after mid-transit,
as shown in Figure 5. This indicates that the orbit of
WASP-66b is nearly aligned with the spin-axis of its host
star.

4. DISCUSSION

We have carried out measurements of the spin-orbit
alignments for three Hot Jupiters, WASP-103b, WASP-
87b, and WASP-66b. Our results indicate that the three
planets are in nearly aligned orbits with respect to the
projected rotational axis of their host star. The spin-
orbit angle measured for WASP-103b is λ = 3◦ ± 33◦.

1 and 2 σ conﬁdence regions (in yellow and red respectively). Fit-
ted Gaussians (in red) are shown separately for the marginalized
distributions over λ (above) and v sin i(cid:63) (right).

(A color version of this ﬁgure will be available in the online jour-
nal.)

The best ﬁt v sin i(cid:63) for WASP-103b using the Rossiter-
McLaughlin eﬀect and not imposing an informative prior
on v sin i(cid:63) is v sin i(cid:63) = 6.5 ± 2.0 kms−1, which is in dis-
agreement (within uncertainties) with both the value de-
termined from the least-squares deconvolution method
and with the value of 10.6±0.9 kms−1 reported by Gillon
et al. (2014). This is concluded to potentially be due stel-
lar line broadening mechanisms other than rotation.
We measured a projected obliquity of λ = −8◦ ± 11◦
for WASP-87b. The stellar rotational velocity of WASP-
87 from the Rossiter-McLaughlin eﬀect is v sin i(cid:63) =
9.8 ± 0.6 kms−1. This is in agreement (within uncer-
tainties) with the value of 9.6 ± 0.7 kms−1 reported by
Anderson et al. (2014). Out of the three systems ana-
lyzed in this work, WASP-87b has the best constrained
spin-orbit angle.
For WASP-66b, the spin-orbit angle is determined to
be λ = −4◦ ± 24◦. The best ﬁt v sin i(cid:63) obtained us-
ing the Rossiter-McLaughlin eﬀect is v sin i(cid:63) = 12.1 ±
2.2 kms−1, which is in agreement with both the value de-
termined from least-squares deconvolution and the value
of 13.4 ± 0.9 kms−1 reported by Hellier et al. (2012).
Additional radial velocities of the Rossiter-McLaughlin
eﬀect for both WASP-103 and WASP-66 are required
to rule out moderately misaligned orbits, however, polar
and retrograde orbits are disfavored for both systems.

The tidal dissipation timescale was determined for
WASP-103b, WASP-87b and WASP-66b following the
procedures given by Albrecht et al. (2012b). For WASP-
103b, the tidal dissipation timescale is τCE = 1.24 ×
109 yr (using the convective timescale for alignment). It
is helpful to normalize τCE to a useful stellar timescale
of 5 Gyr which results in τCE
5Gyr = 0.248. If the mass of
the convective envelope is taken into account (the sec-
ond approach of Albrecht et al. 2012b), the timescale
becomes τmcz = 3.11 × 106 yr. Normalizing this to the
model age for the host star (Tzams = 4.0× 109 yr) results
in τmcz

The tidal dissipation timescale for WASP-87b is τRA =

= 7.77 × 10−4.

that would not be very eﬃcient at realigning a high obliq-
uity planetary orbit. In addition, Anderson et al. (2014)
found a nearby early-G star 8.2" from WASP-87A that
appears to be a bound companion, suggesting that Kozai
resonances might have inﬂuenced the obliquity of WASP-
87b. Given these circumstances, WASP-87b was pre-
dicted to have high probability of being misaligned, but
was observed to be on a low obliquity orbit.

for this planet is low (though moderate misalignments
cannot be ruled out). Orbital obliquities are thought
to be distributed randomly from the migration processes
that produce Hot Jupiters, regardless of the value of Tef f
(Winn et al. 2010a; Albrecht et al. 2012b). Therefore,
the observed obliquities should be randomly distributed
for systems with long τmcz and low obliquites for sys-
tems with short τmcz (Winn et al. 2010a; Albrecht et al.
2012b). Alternatively, WASP-66b and WASP-87b could
have undergone type 1 and 2 disk driven migration (e.g.,
Lin et al. 1996) and therefore never had their orbits mis-
aligned by the migration process.

It is important to emphasize that the true spin-orbit
angle (ψ) cannot be determined directly by the Rossiter-
McLaughlin eﬀect (e.g., see Fabrycky & Winn 2009). In-
stead, we measure the sky projected spin-orbit angle (λ),
since the orientation of the stellar rotation axis to our
line of sight is unknown. Fabrycky & Winn (2009); Mor-
ton & Johnson (2011); Chaplin et al. (2013) have shown
that λ is only a lower limit on ψ and that a small |λ|
does not necessarily translate as a small true misalign-

ment (|ψ|). However, a large |λ| does indicate a large
value for |ψ| (Fabrycky & Winn 2009). There are ways
of constraining the true spin-orbit angle (see e.g., Fab-
rycky & Winn 2009; Morton & Johnson 2011; Perryman
2011; Chaplin et al. 2013). One way to estimate the in-
clination of a star’s spin axis (i(cid:63)) is by combining the
projected rotational velocity (v sin i from line broaden-
ing), the stellar rotational period Prot (from high preci-
sion photometry), and R(cid:63) (from accurate knowledge of
the spectral type). Then using sin i(cid:63), I, and λ, one can
determine ψ (see, Chaplin et al. 2013). Asteroseismol-
ogy is a powerful technique that provides an additional
means of estimating sin i(cid:63) and determining ψ for tran-
siting planets, independent of the Rossiter-McLaughlin
eﬀect (e.g., see, Chaplin et al. 2013).

Winn et al. (2010a) and Albrecht et al. (2012b) noted
a dependence between the eﬀective temperature of a host
star and the degree of orbital misalignment of its planet.
They observed that obliquities generally fall into two dis-
tinct populations. The coolest stars (T < 6250 K) tend
to host planets with well aligned orbits while stars hot-

ter than 6250 K host planets with a wide distribution of
orbital obliquities.

Figure 7 shows an updated version of the projected or-
bital obliquity verses stellar temperature plot from Es-
posito et al. (2014) and Addison et al. (2014a), with our
measured spin-orbit angles for WASP-103b, WASP-87b,
and WASP-66b and from our recently published work on
WASP-79b (Addison et al. 2013) and HATS-3b (Addison
et al. 2014a). This ﬁgure suggest that the temperature
trend observed in previous studies is no longer so clear
cut. A substantial number of stars with Tef f < 6250 K
host planets on misaligned orbits. Of the 68 stars with
Tef f < 6250 K that have measured spin-orbit angles, 21
(∼ 31%) host planets on misaligned orbits.

The most obvious outliers in Figure 7 are the six plan-
ets labeled to left of the dashed red line at Tef f = 6250 K
which are on signiﬁcantly misaligned orbits. These sys-
tems clearly break the observed trend between obliquity
and temperature. However, two of those planets (WASP-
80b, Triaud et al. 2013a; and WASP-2b, Albrecht et al.

2011) do not have well constrained λ values despite the
small uncertainties reported. For WASP-80b, this is due
to λ being almost entirely dependent on the value of
v sin i(cid:63). For WASP-2b, Albrecht et al. (2011) could not
detect the Rossiter-McLaughlin eﬀect from the 66 spec-
tra they obtained for this system that span the tran-
sit using the Planet Finding Spectrograph on Magellan
and the High Dispersion Spectrograph on Subaru, con-
tradicting the signiﬁcant misalignment measured by Tri-
aud et al. (2010) from the 15 spectra they obtained using
the High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher.

The sample of stars with measured spin-orbit angles
still does appears to show that λ has a weak depen-
dence on host star temperature. Around 52% ± 17%
of stars (out of 31 that have measured spin-orbit an-
gles) with Tef f ≥ 6250 K host planets on misaligned or-
bits. This is in contrast to the ∼ 32% ± 12% of stars
with Tef f < 6250 K (that have measured spin-orbit an-
gles as previously mentioned) that host planets on mis-
aligned orbits. Based on these statistics, high obliquity

orbits are more likely ((cid:38) 1σ) to be found around stars
Tef f ≥ 6250 K than stars Tef f < 6250 K (a trend that
has been noted by Winn et al. 2010a; Albrecht et al.
2012b; and others).

The (weakly) observed temperature trend might be ex-
plained by the thickness of the stellar convective enve-
lope and its ability to tidally dampen orbital obliqui-
ties (as discussed in Addison et al. 2014a). Stars with
Tef f ≥ 6250 K have thin convective layers, therefore,
planet-star tidal interactions are weak and unable to re-
align highly misaligned orbits (Albrecht et al. 2012b). In
contrast, stars with Tef f < 6250 K have a thicker convec-
tive envelope, that results in stronger planet-star tidal in-
teractions and shorter realignment timescales. It should
be noted that while Tef f = 6250 K is often used (e.g.,
Winn et al. 2010a; Albrecht et al. 2012b) as the dividing
boundary between stars with thin vs thick convective lay-
ers, this boundary is only approximate. The convective
zone mass actually decreases exponentially as a function
of stellar temperature above Tef f ∼ 5500 K while de-
creasing linearly below this temperature (Pinsonneault
et al. 2001).

Hence, the ability of a star to host planets on high
obliquity orbits for billions of years is dependent more
on the tidal-dissipation timescale than just the stellar
eﬀective temperature. Cool stars can host planets on
misaligned orbits if the tidal-dissipation timescale for re-
alignment is very long (i.e., as suggested by the realign-
ment timescale Equations 2-4 in Albrecht et al. 2012b).
The relationship between tidal-dissipation timescale and
orbital obliquity is more clearly illustrated in Figure 8,
which is an updated plot7 from Albrecht et al. (2013)
and Addison et al. (2014a) using Equations 11 and 12.
It shows a trend towards higher orbital obliquities for
longer relative tidal-dissipation timescales. This trend
does appear to be more obvious than the widely reported
temperature vs obliquity correlation (see Figure 7). This
is likely because high obliquities are dependent on other
relevant physical parameters (i.e., a/R(cid:63), MP /M(cid:63), and
MP /M(cid:63)) than just stellar temperature alone.

star has convective or radiative envelope. Albrecht et al.

envelope for stars Tef f ≥ 6250 K are too thin to realign
orbital obliquities and therefore set the boundary at that

trend of cool stars (Tef f < 6250 K) hosting planets on low obliq-
uity orbits (WASP-80b, Triaud et al. 2013a; HAT-P-11b, Winn

tion the gradual thinning of the convective envelope with
increasing stellar temperature.

To circumvent this issue, Albrecht et al. (2012b) de-
vised a second approach for calculating the tidal dissipa-
tion timescales by deriving an equation that takes into
account the mass of the convective envelope (τmcz, see
Equation 13).

Where Mcz is the amount of mass in the convective

also informed us that the equation for τmcz (given as
1/τmcz ∝ 1/Mcz in the publication Albrecht et al. 2012b)
is incorrect and should be 1/τmcz ∝ Mcz. This correction
has been implemented in Equation 13 and is the equation
being used in this work.

We present Table 9, which list the Tef f , age, λ, ψ (if
known), Mcz, τCE or τRA, and τmcz and their associated
uncertainties of the exoplanetary systems with measured

WASP-103 reported in this publication, as a reference

summary of all these tidal dissipation timescales and the
stellar convective zone masses. The stellar and plane-
tary physical parameters used for calculating Mcz, τCE
or τRA, and τmcz were obtained from the TEPCat cat-
alog9 and the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia10. Mcz
were calculated from the EZ-Web11 tool made available

Results from a direct imaging survey, carried out by
Ngo et al. (2015) to search for stellar companions around
Hot Jupiters with measured spin-orbit alignments, shows
no correlation between the incidence of stellar compan-
ions and planets being on misaligned or eccentric orbits.
The Ngo et al. survey targeted a sample of 50 systems,
27 hosting planets on misaligned and/or eccentric or-
bits and 23 on well-aligned and circular orbits (classi-
ﬁed as the ‘control sample’), to determine if any corre-
lations exist between misaligned/eccentric Hot Jupiters
and the incidence of stellar companions. They discov-
ered 19 stellar companions around 17 stars and from this
result determined that the companion fraction for sys-
tems hosting misaligned planets is approximately equal
(to within their reported uncertainties) to that of spin-
orbit aligned systems. Their survey suggest that stellar
companions may not play a dominant role in produc-
ing planets on high obliquity orbits. Interestingly, Law
et al. (2014) found tentative evidence (at the 98% con-
ﬁdence) for stellar companions leading to an increased
rate of close-in giant planets from a adaptive optics sur-

vey of 715 Kepler planetary system candidates with the
Robo-AO robotic laser adaptive optics system. There-
fore, migration mechanisms that require the presence of
stellar companions to operate, such as the Kozai mech-
anism (Kozai 1962; Lidov 1962; Fabrycky & Tremaine
2007), are disfavored. Other migration scenarios, such
as planet-planet scattering (Chatterjee et al. 2008) or
primordial disk misalignments (from binary companions
that were present at an earlier epoch but later removed
through dynamical processes, see Batygin 2012), might
be more favored.

Our group is also conducting a similar direct imag-
ing survey, but in the southern hemisphere, to search for
stellar companions around planetary systems with mea-
sured spin-orbit alignments. We are using the Magellan
Adaptive Optics (MagAO) system on the 6.5 m Magel-
lan Telescope at the Las Campanas Observatory in Chile
to survey nearby stars within 250 pc (see, Addison et al.
2014b,a). The results from our direct imaging search will
be available soon and will complement the Ngo et al.
(2015) survey. Taken together, the results from the two
surveys will provide a strong test of the Kozai mechanism
as the dominant driver for misaligning planetary orbits.
In addition to these direct imaging searches, a radial
velocity survey was conducted by Knutson et al. (2014)
of 51 transiting planetary systems (50 of which were in
the Ngo et al. 2015 direct imaging survey). Knutson et
al. found no correlation between planets on high obliq-
uity orbits and the occurrence rate of long-period mas-
sive planetary companions. This seems to suggest that
planet-planet scattering may also not be playing a sig-
niﬁcant role in shaping the orbital obliquities of planets.
Ngo et al. (2015) oﬀer an alternative hypothesis, propos-
ing that the protoplanetary disks are perturbed out of
alignment at the epoch of star and planet formation due
to primordially bound stellar binaries. The binary com-
panions are later removed from the planetary systems
through dynamical interactions between stars in crowded
stellar clusters, eliminating their current observational
signatures (Malmberg et al. 2007; Ngo et al. 2015).

If high obliquity Hot Jupiters are indeed the result of
primordial disk misalignments, then there should be a
signiﬁcant number of debris disks observed to be in mis-
alignment with the spin axis of their host star. Recent
observations of well-aligned debris disk (e.g., Kennedy
et al. 2013; Greaves et al. 2014), however, argue against
this mechanism being responsible for the majority of
spin-orbit misalignments. This model can also be tested
from measurements of spin-orbit alignments in co-planar
multi-planet systems with stellar companions. Since mul-
tiple transiting planet systems are nearly co-planar (at
least for the planets that are transiting), presumably
their orbits trace the plane of the protoplanetary disk
from which the planets formed originally (Albrecht et al.
2013). Therefore, misalignments produced through dy-
namical mechanisms would result in planets on various
orbital planes and with diﬀerent observed obliquities. If
these systems are found to be predominantly in spin-
orbit alignment, then high obliquity Hot Jupiter systems
are likely the result of high eccentricity migration (i.e.,
planet-planet scatterings, secular chaos, Kozai-Lidov res-
onances, etc.) instead of primordial star-disk misalign-
ments (Albrecht et al. 2012b). If, however, the obliqui-
ties of multi-planet systems are similarly distributed to

Spin-orbit alignments of WASP-103b, WASP-87b, & WASP-66b

13

those observed for Hot Jupiters, then this would suggest
that spin-orbit misalignments are produced through pro-
cesses other than migration such as primordial disk mis-
alignments. Recent spin-orbit alignment measurements
of transiting multi-planet systems have revealed that six
host planets on low obliquity orbits (Sanchis-Ojeda et al.
2012; Albrecht et al. 2013; Chaplin et al. 2013; Sanchis-
Ojeda et al. 2015), while one host planets on misaligned
orbits (Huber et al. 2013). Statistical studies on the dis-
tribution of orbital obliquities of Kepler transiting plan-
ets, using the photometric stellar rotational amplitudes
produced from star spots in the Kepler lightcurves, sug-
gest that planets are more likely to be found on mis-
aligned orbits around hot stars than cool stars (Mazeh
et al. 2015) and if they orbit a star with only a single de-
tected transiting planet as opposed to orbiting a star with
multiple detected transiting planets (Morton & Winn
2014). The sample size, however, is too small to draw
any deﬁnitive conclusions. Therefore, more multi-planet
systems need to have their spin-orbit angles measured to
test the primordial disk misalignments hypothesis and
to resolve the migration processes of high obliquity plan-
ets. Such a sample of suitably bright stars with multiple
transiting planets should be found by the ongoing K2
mission, the new two-wheel operation mode of Kepler, in
the near future (e.g., see Howell et al. 2014).

5. CONCLUSIONS

Measurements of the spin-orbit angles of WASP-66b,
WASP-87b, and WASP-103b from the work presented
in this paper, taken together with the whole sample of
systems, seems to support the Winn et al. (2010a) and
Albrecht et al. (2012b) hypothesis that Hot Jupiters once
had a broad distribution of orbital obliquities (from the
migration mechanisms that produced them). In addition,
the data suggest that high eccentricity migration mod-
els are slightly more favored over disk migration models.
This is because planets migrate too quickly (according to
the current disk migrations models) and misaligned de-
bris disk appear to be rare (though the sample size is still
too small to draw deﬁnitive conclusions). Alternatively,
high obliquities could be produced from a combination of
two or more mechanisms operating concurrently (e.g., see
Morton & Johnson 2011). It is even possible that there is
no ‘one’ dominant mechanism common to all Hot Jupiter
systems, implying diﬀerent mechanisms are operating in
each system and this is dependent on the initial forma-
tion conditions of the system. Therefore, we believe a
lingering question still remains: what are the dominant
mechanism(s) producing high obliquity Hot Jupiters?

Resolving this question will require a further expansion
of the sample of systems with measured spin-orbit angles,
in particular: low-mass planets, long-period planets, and
multi-planet systems. Finally, direct imaging (e.g., Ad-
dison et al. 2014b; Ngo et al. 2015) and radial velocity
(e.g., Knutson et al. 2014) searches for stellar and plane-
tary companions around stars hosting Hot Jupiters with
spin-orbit angle measurements will empirically test Kozai
resonances (one of the most commonly proposed migra-
tion mechanisms) as the dominant driving force behind
the production of the large number of Hot Jupiters on
high obliquity orbits.

Note – The sample of planetary systems with measured spin-orbit angles were selected from the Rossiter-McLaughlin Catalogue and the Ren´e Heller’s
Holt-Rossiter-McLaughlin Encyclopaedia on 2015 November. λ and ψ values, along with the associated uncertainties were obtained from the Holt-Rossiter-
McLaughlin Encyclopaedia. The other stellar and planetary parameters used to calculate Mcz, as well as the realignment timescales (τRA, τCE, and τmcz)
were taken from The Rossiter-McLaughlin Catalogue, The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia, and the references provided.
a Systems with no reported age in the literature are set to 0.5 Gyr.
b We found HAT-P-13 had started evolving oﬀ the main-sequence at ∼ 3.5 Gyr and was quite evolved at the reported age of 5.0 Gyr, using the EZ-Web stellar
evolution tool. Therefore, we determined Mcz and computed τmcz assuming a stellar age at 3.5 Gyr.
c We found WASP-15 to be pretty evolved at the reported age of 3.9 Gyr, using the EZ-Web stellar evolution tool. Therefore, we set the stellar age to the
lower age estimate of 2.6 Gyr to determine Mcz and compute τmcz.
d The EZ-Web tool stopped evolving WASP-20 after ∼ 6 Gyr since it had evolved well oﬀ the main-sequence and is likely a white dwarf at the reported age
of 7 Gyr. We thus assumed a stellar age of 1 Gyr for determining Mcz and computing τmcz since the stellar properties from EZ-Web best matched those that
are published.
e We found WASP-71 to be fairly evolved at the reported age of 2.5 Gyr, using the EZ-Web stellar evolution tool. Therefore, we set the stellar age to the
lower age estimate of 2.0 Gyr to determine Mcz and compute τmcz.
