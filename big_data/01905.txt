(Dated: 15 March 2016)

Generalized quantum master equations (GQMEs) are an important tool in modeling chemical and physical
processes. For a large number of problems it has been shown that exact and approximate quantum dynamics
methods can be made dramatically more eﬃcient, and in the latter case more accurate, by proceeding via the
GQME formalism. However, there are many situations where utilizing the GQME approach seems to oﬀer no
advantage over a direct evaluation of the property of interest. Here we provide a more detailed understanding
of the conditions under which these methods will oﬀer beneﬁts. In particular, we derive exact expressions for
the memory kernel for systems both in and out of equilibrium, and show the conditions under which these
expressions will be guaranteed to return a result identical to that obtained from direct simulation. We also
show the conditions which approximate methods must satisfy if they are to oﬀer diﬀerent results when used
in conjunction with the GQME formalism. These exact analytical results thus provide new insights as to
when proceeding via the GQME approach can improve the accuracy or eﬃciency of simulations.

Generalized quantum master equations (GQMEs) pro-
vide a formal framework to describe the time evolu-
tion of observables and correlation functions in complex,
many-body, systems based on the projection operator
method.1–3 The generalized master equation formalism
has found extensive use both in allowing eﬃcient and
accurate calculations of material properties,
including
diﬀusion constants of liquids,4–8 density ﬂuctuations in
glasses,9–12 and structural relaxation in polymers.13,14 In
addition, it has also been heavily exploited as an anal-
ysis tool to uncover the inherent timescales in complex
chemical systems,15 as a dimensionality reduction tech-
nique in the development of coarse-grained molecular
models,16 and more broadly in areas such as meteorologi-
cal and ﬁnancial time-series analysis and optimal predic-
tion methods.17–20 The central quantity in the GQME
formalism is the the memory kernel, which encodes the
eﬀect of the projected dynamical degrees of freedom on
the observable. However, the standard expressions for
the memory kernel contain projected dynamical quanti-
ties that are impractical to simulate directly. This has led
to the development of a number of ways to approximate
the memory kernel that allow it to be recast in terms
of unprojected dynamical quantities,21,22 assumed func-
tional forms,23 or a given (perturbative or Markovian)
limit.24–29

Just over a decade ago, Shi and Geva derived a for-
mally exact representation for the memory kernel of the
Nakajima-Zwanzig GQME that requires only projection-
free input.30 This representation opened the door to using

either numerically exact or approximate methods to sim-
ulate the memory kernel. For exact treatments, whose
computational cost increases severely with propagation
time, exploiting the rapid decay of the memory kernel
has been shown to allow for signiﬁcant gains in the eﬃ-
ciency of simulating charge and energy transport in the
condensed phase.30–40 When approximate dynamics are
used, such as those arising from the quantum-classical
and semiclassical hierarchies,41–45 signiﬁcant improve-
ments in both accuracy and eﬃciency have been achieved
when used to calculate the memory kernel compared to
their direct application.31,32,46–49 However, it has been
shown that such improvements sensitively depend on how
one calculates the projection-free partial kernels that are
used to construct the memory kernel.49 These observa-
tions naturally raise questions as to why this is and when
proceeding via the projection operator formalism will be
advantageous.

Here we show, for both equilibrium and nonequilib-
rium systems, the conditions under which proceeding via
the GQME formalism yields results that are guaranteed
to be identical to the original dynamics used in the pro-
jection free input, and suggest ways in which this lim-
itation can be overcome. To achieve this we show how
the memory kernel governing the evolution of equilib-
rium and nonequilibrium systems can be exactly cast in
terms of unprojected correlation functions, which can be
straightforwardly simulated using either exact or approx-
imate methods. By analyzing these expressions we derive
the necessary requirements for an approximate dynam-
ics to yield the same results when used directly and as
an approximation to the memory kernel in the GQME
approach. These results thus provide insights into when
GQME methods might allow for improvement in accu-

racy or eﬃciency in equilibrium and nonequilibrium sit-
uations in a diverse set of systems.

To begin we consider the Nakajima-Zwanzig GQME,1,2
which provides a route for describing the reduced dynam-
ics of systems out of equilibrium. In this scheme the total
system is decomposed into two parts: the system, which
consists of all the degrees of freedom of interest in the
problem, and the bath, which comprises the remaining
degrees of freedom. For equilibrium systems the Mori
approach is typically the preferred formulation.3 How-
ever, the Mori formalism, which renders distinction be-
tween system and bath unnecessary, is general and can
also be used for equilibrium and nonequilibrium prob-
lems. Indeed, as observed in Ref. 49, both the Mori and
Nakajima-Zwanzig approaches can be written in a uni-
ﬁed formalism stemming from the projected equation of
motion for the propagator,

d
dt

eiLt = eiLtiL = eiLt(P + Q)iL

(1)

 [ ˆH, ·], ˆH is the
where the Liouville operator is L = 1
Hamiltonian operator, P is a projection operator and
Q = 1 − P is the complementary projection operator.

Central to the Mori approach is the appropriate choice
of projection operator, P. In the following, we assume
that it takes the form,

P = |A)(A|,

(2)

where A contains a subset of observables which are of
particular interest. The deﬁnition of the inner product
is chosen such that (A|A) = 1, thus satisfying the idem-
potency condition, P 2 = P. Consequently, the comple-
mentary projector, Q, is by construction orthogonal to
the subspace deﬁned by P.

Using the Dyson operator identity

eiLt = eiQLt + Z t

0

dτ eiL(t−τ )(PiL)eiQLτ ,

(3)

to expand the second term in the second equality of
Eq. (1) yields

d
dt

eiLt = ieiLtPL + iQeiLQtL

− Z t

0

dτ eiL(t−τ )PLQeiLQτ L.

2

Direct evaluation of the memory kernel in Eq. (6) is prob-
lematic, as it requires the action of the projected propa-
gator, eiQLt.

To circumvent the diﬃculty of the projected propaga-
tor, the Dyson identity, Eq. (3), can be used to obtain a
self-consistent expansion of the memory kernel,

K(t) = K1(t) + Z t

0

dτ K3(t − τ )K(τ ),

(7)

where the partial (auxiliary) kernels,

K1(t) = (A|LQeiLtQL|A),
K3(t) = −i(A|LQeiLt|A),

(8)

(9)

no longer require the use of projected dynamics. The la-
bels for the partial kernels of 1 and 3 are chosen so as to
be consistent with earlier work.30,31,46–49 In principle, the
memory kernel K(t) can be obtained by generating K1(t)
and K3(t) from simulation and solving Eq. (7) numer-
ically. Depending on the choice of projection operator
and deﬁnition of the inner product, one can specialize
this result to equilibrium correlation functions or equi-
librium population dynamics.

In the equilibrium case the Kubo-transformed correla-
tion function is obtained by deﬁning the inner product
as

(A|O|A) ≡ Z β

0

dλ Tr[ρeqA†(0)OA(iλ)] · χ−1
AA,

(10)

where O is a general superoperator in Liouville space,
ρeq = Z −1e−β ˆH is the canonical density operator, Z =
Tr[e−β ˆH ] is the partition function, β = 1/kBT is the in-
verse of the thermal energy, and χAA = Tr[ρA†(0)A(0)].
Commonly, the elements of the vector A are chosen to
consist of a dynamical variable, a, which is a function of
the coordinates and momenta of the system, and its time
derivative, ˙a = iLa. For example, in the case of diﬀusion
a could be chosen to be the position or velocity of some
or all of the particles, and for infra-red spectroscopy as
the system dipole moment.

In nonequilibrium cases the inner product may be de-

ﬁned as49

(4)

(A|O|A)nm ≡ Tr[RBA†

nOAm],

(11)

Restricting our attention to correlation functions de-
ﬁned by the inner product of the elements constituting
P, the equation of motion for the propagator in Eq. (4)
yields the following Mori-type GQME for the correlation
function C(t) = (A|A(t)),

˙C(t) = C(t) ˙C(0) − Z t

0

dτ C(t − τ )K(τ ),

(5)

and the memory kernel, K(t), takes the form,

K(t) = (A|LQeiQLtQL|A).

(6)

where the set {An} spans a limited subspace of total
Hilbert space of the system, and RB is an operator that
belongs to the complementary space, which is convention-
ally denoted as the bath. The normalization condition on
RB requires that the trace over the bath degrees of free-
dom yield unity, TrB[RB] = 1. The elements of A can,
for example, be chosen such that {An} spans all outer
products of the system states and RB = eβHB /TrB[eβHB ]
corresponds to the canonical distribution for the bath de-
grees of freedom. Such a choice for the projector provides
access to nonequilibrium population and coherence dy-
namics of the system, and has been used in the context of

the spin-boson model,30,31,39,46,47,49 and in a wide class
of quantum impurity models to access site occupation
dynamics in the presence of one or more noninteracting
fermionic or bosonic baths.34–38,40

The expressions in Eqs. (7), (8), and (9) have been
shown to improve the accuracy of the dynamics produced
by a number of approximate methods31,46–49 when used
in the GQME formalism. However, one can take these
exact expressions and manipulate them using relation-
ships that are exactly satisﬁed in quantum mechanics to
obtain alternative expressions that, when approximated,
can yield diﬀerent results. Here we show the manipula-
tions that one can make that can be proved to rigorously
return a result that is identical to that obtained using the
approximate method directly, irrespective of the method
employed. Extension of this analysis reveals the condi-
tions that must be satisﬁed by an approximate method
to guarantee that the same result is obtained no mat-
ter which route, or way of formally rewriting the partial
kernels, is taken.

To derive exact expressions for the partial kernels
which, when used to obtain the dynamics using Eqs. (5)
and (7), are guaranteed give the same result as a di-
rect simulation, regardless of the dynamics approach
employed, one begins by expanding the complemen-
tary projection operator Q and applying the Liouville
operators.49 Carrying out the former operation for K3
(Eq. (9)) yields,

K3(t) = −i(A|LeiLt|A) + i(A|L|A)(A|eiLt|A).

(12)

The Liouville operator, L, can then be applied backwards
on the static part or forwards to generate the time deriva-
tive. Doing the latter allows the partial kernel to be writ-
ten purely as a function of C(t) and its time derivatives,

K3(t) = − ˙C(t) + ˙C(0)C(t).

(13)

Proceeding similarly for K1 gives,

K1(t) = (A|LeiLtL|A) − ˙C(0)C(t) ˙C(0)

+ i ˙C(0)(A|eiLtL|A) + i(A|LeiLt|A) ˙C(0)

= (A|eiLtL2|A) − ˙C(0)C(t) ˙C(0)

+ i{ ˙C(0), (A|eiLtL|A)}

= − ¨C(t) + { ˙C(0), ˙C(t)} − ˙C(0)C(t) ˙C(0),

(14)

where in the second and last equalities the braces denote
the anticommutator.

Due to the convolution-based structure of the equa-
tions relating the full memory kernel to the partial mem-
ory kernels,
it is particularly convenient to consider
its Fourier-Laplace representation. The Fourier-Laplace
transform of C(t) is deﬁned as,

C(ω) = Z ∞

0

dt eiωtC(t),

(15)

3

and its nth time-derivative, C(n)(t) ≡ dn

dtn C(t), is

C(n)(ω) = (−iω)nC(ω) −

n

(−iω)n−kC(k−1)(t = 0).

Xk=1

(16)
Application of the Fourier-Laplace transform to Eq. (7)
gives,

K(ω) = [1 − K3(ω)]−1K1(ω)

(17)

and to Eqs. (14) and (13) yields,

K1(ω) = −Ω(ω)[1 + C(ω)Ω(ω)],
K3(ω) = 1 + Ω(ω)C(ω),

(18)
(19)

where Ω(ω) = iω + ˙C(t = 0). Fourier-Laplace trans-
forming and rearranging the equation of motion for the
correlation function in Eq. (5) results in

K(ω) = C(ω)−1[1 + C(ω)Ω(ω)],

(20)

where we have used C(t = 0) = 1, which follows from the
idempotency property of the projector.

Using the Fourier-Laplace transforms of the memory
kernels in Eqs. (18) and (19) in Eq. (17) and inserting
the result into the left hand side of Eq. (20) returns the
identity C(ω) = C(ω). Hence, when one uses expressions
for the partial kernels that depend only on the original
correlation function, C(t), and its time-derivatives, one is
certain to recover exactly the same result as would be ob-
tained from a direct application of the dynamics used to
calculate the partial kernels. This result therefore proves
that no accuracy beneﬁt can be obtained through the
GQME for any approximate method using Eqs. (13) and
(14).53More explicitly, using manipulations that are ex-
actly satisﬁed by quantum mechanics to recast the par-
tial kernels in terms of the original correlation function
and its time derivatives removes any potential beneﬁt for
gains in accuracy by proceeding via the GQME formal-
ism.

It should be noted that all the expressions given for
the partial memory kernels in the preceding equations
(i.e., Eqs. (8) and (9) as well as Eqs. (14) and (13)) are
guaranteed to give the same result as a direct applica-
tion when exact quantum dynamics is used to generate
them. However, if the partial kernels are shorter-lived
than the correlation function, one can still obtain signiﬁ-
cant eﬃciency gains when using numerically exact meth-
ods, which scale poorly with simulation time.

The fact that Eqs. (13) and (14) cannot be used to ob-
tain an increase in accuracy for any approximate method
begs the question: What are the conditions that an ap-
proximate method must satisfy to guarantee that the
same result will be obtained by using Eqs. (8) and (9)
as Eqs. (14) and (13)? Identifying such conditions allows
the identiﬁcation of the classes of approximate methods
which cannot gain accuracy beneﬁts by combination with
the GQME formalism. Indeed, we can immediately see

that approximate methods only need to satisfy two such
conditions. The ﬁrst is that

d
dt

C(t) = (A|eiL′t[iL′A]),

(21)

where L′ indicates a Liouville operators corresponding
to an approximate dynamics. Explicitly, this condition
requires that the correlation function of A and the op-
erator resulting from the action of the Liouvillian acting
on A is equivalent to the time-derivative of the original
correlation function. While the equality in Eq. (21) is
trivially maintained for numerically exact methods, the
same is not necessarily true for approximate methods.
The second condition requires that the approximate Li-
ouville operator commutes with the propagator,

[L′, eiL′t] = 0.

(22)

These conditions are all that are required of an approx-
imate method to perform the manipulations in Eq. (14)
and likewise to obtain Eq. (13) from Eq. (9).

In the case of equilibrium correlation functions, where
the Liouville operator commutes with the canonical den-
sity matrix, Eq. (22) is equivalent to time-translational
invariance. For example, dynamics methods such as
CMD,52 RPMD,50,51 and purely classical mechanics sat-
isfy these properties and thus are guaranteed not to ob-
tain increased accuracy when used to approximate equi-
librium correlation functions via the GQME approach.
However, for nonequilibrium correlation functions, and
for methods that do not satisfy these conditions, one
can expect the dynamics resulting from the GQME to
diﬀer from the direct application of the approximate
method, as has been shown in previous work where sig-
niﬁcant gains in both eﬃciency and accuracy have been
achieved.31,32,46–49

In this paper we have provided a set of exact expres-
sions for the memory kernel in the Mori and Nakajima-
Zwanzig GQME formalisms. These expressions for the
memory kernel can be simulated directly using exact or
approximate dynamics methods. We have shown that
when the memory kernel is formally cast in terms of
the original correlation function and its time derivatives,
the GQME is guaranteed to return the same result as
that obtained from a direct simulation, regardless of
the method used to construct the kernel. We have fur-
ther speciﬁed the criteria that an approximate dynamics
method must satisfy to produce GQME dynamics that
are identical to the direct dynamics, independent of the
way the partial kernels are expressed. In cases where no
such beneﬁt in accuracy can be obtained, one may still
expect the GQME scheme to yield improved eﬃciency if
the memory kernels are short-lived. Conversely, violation
of the criteria in Eqs. (21) and (22) imply that the re-
sulting GQME dynamics will in general be diﬀerent from
direct simulation of the correlation functions. Previous
studies31,46–49 have indeed conﬁrmed this fact, showing
that the GQME approach is capable of yielding signiﬁ-
cant gains both in eﬃciency and accuracy when one does

4

not invoke the formal recasting of the partial kernels in
Eqs. (13) and (14). These insights thus outline a path for
future applications of the GQME formalism by allowing
one to assess the beneﬁts that it may aﬀord.
