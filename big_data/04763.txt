ON THE HARNACK INEQUALITY FOR DEGENERATE AND SINGULAR ELLIPTIC

EQUATIONS WITH UNBOUNDED LOWER ORDER TERMS VIA SLIDING

PARABOLOIDS

NAM Q. LE

Abstract. We use the method of sliding paraboloids to establish a Harnack inequality for linear, degenerate
and singular elliptic equation with unbounded lower order terms. The equations we consider include uniformly

elliptic equations and linearized Monge-Amp`ere equations. Our argument allows us to prove the doubling estimate

for functions which, at points of large gradient, are solutions of (degenerate and singular) elliptic equations with
unbounded drift.

1. Introduction and statement of the main result

This paper is concerned with establishing a Harnack inequality for linear, degenerate and singular elliptic
equations with unbounded lower order terms via the method of sliding paraboloids originated from works of Cabr´e
[2] and Savin [15]. The equations we consider include uniformly elliptic equations as in Krylov-Safonov’s theory
[11] and degenerate and singular elliptic, linearized Monge-Amp`ere equations as in Caﬀarelli-Guti´errez’s theory
[5]. Our argument allows us to prove the doubling estimate for functions which, at points of large gradient, are
solutions of (degenerate and singular) elliptic equations with unbounded drift. These functions have been recently
studied by Imbert-Silvestre [9] and Mooney [13].

We begin by recalling the theory of Krylov and Safonov. In 1979, Krylov-Safonov [11] established their celebrated

Harnack inequality for nonnegative solutions to linear, uniformly elliptic equations in non-divergence form

Krylov-Safonov’s Harnack inequality states that if v ∈ W 2,n
Ω ⊂ Rn, then for any ball B2r(x0) ⊂⊂ Ω, we have

There are many proofs of Krylov-Safonov’s Harnack inequality. In this paper, we focus on their original proof which
has been successfully extended to other equations including fully nonlinear equations, degenerate and singular
equations, and equations with lower order terms.

The idea of the proof is the following; see also Caﬀarelli-Cabr´e [4]. In the ﬁrst step, we show that the distribution
function of v, |{v > t}| decays like t−ε (Lε estimate) for some small positive constant ε depending only on n, λ,
and Λ. Thus, up to universal constants depending only on n, λ, and Λ, v is comparable to v(x0) in Br(x0) except
a set of very small measure. In the second step, we show that if v(x∗) is much larger than v(x0) at some point x∗

in Br(x0), then by the same method (now applying to C1 − C2v), we also ﬁnd that v is much larger than v(x0) in
a subset of Br(x0) of positive measure. This contradicts the Lε estimate in the ﬁrst step.

There are three main estimates in the proof of the Lε estimate.

Measure estimate: This estimate says that if v ∈ W 2,n
loc (Ω) is a nonnegative supersolution to (1.1) in
B3r(x0) ⊂⊂ Ω and v is small at least at a point, say, less than or equal to 1, in Br(x0) then, the superlevel
set {v > M (n, λ, Λ)} ∩ B2r(x0) in the double ball B2r(x0) covers at most (1 − δ(n, λ, Λ)) fraction of its
measure, for some universal constants δ(n, λ, Λ) ∈ (0, 1) and M (n, λ, Λ) > 0. This estimate is not diﬃcult
and is traditionally based on the Aleksandrov-Bakelman-Pucci (ABP) maximum principle (see, for example,
Gilbarg-Trudinger [7, Theorem 9.1]). In the ABP estimate, we need the lower bound on the determinant of
the coeﬃcient matrix which is the case here.
Doubling estimate: This estimate says that if v ∈ W 2,n
loc (Ω) is a nonnegative supersolution to (1.1) in
B3r(x0) ⊂⊂ Ω and v is at least 1 in Br(x0) then in the double ball B2r(x0), the value of v is not smaller
than a positive constant c(n, λ, Λ). This estimate is traditionally based on the construction of subsolutions.
Power decay estimate: This estimate establishes the geometric decay of {v > t} ∩ Br(x0). It is based on
the measure and doubling estimates and a covering lemma which is a consequence of geometric properties
of Euclidean balls.

The next two sections will be devoted to reviewing some interesting and fairly new ideas in obtaining the measure
and doubling estimates, used in the proofs of Harnack inequality for non-divergence form elliptic equations, other
than the ones mentioned above.

1.1. On measure estimate. In [2], Cabr´e devised a new method to prove measure estimate in order to prove a
Harnack inequality on Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative sectional curvature. The idea is to estimate the
measure of the superlevel set of supersolutions by sliding some speciﬁc functions from below and estimating the
measure of the set of contact points. In [2], Cabr´e uses the distance function squared which is a natural replacement
of quadratic polynomials in a Riemannian manifold.

In [15], Savin introduced the method of sliding paraboloids (see Deﬁnition 2.1) from below to obtain the measure
estimate thus bypassing the use of ABP estimate. Here paraboloids of constant opening are slided from below
till they touch the graph of v for the ﬁrst time. These are the points where we use the equation and obtain the
lower bound for the measure of the touching points. Since the values of the solution at the touching points are
universally bounded from above, we obtain the measure estimate. This method was later extended by Wang [19]
to parabolic equations.

There has been an increasing number of papers inspired by Savin’s method. We would like to mention three

recent papers [1, 9, 13] that are most relevant to the content of our paper.

In [1], Armstrong and Smart study regularity and stochastic homogenization of fully nonlinear equations without
uniform ellipticity. In order to carry out their analysis, they prove new deterministic regularity estimates in which
the dependence on a uniform upper bound for the ellipticity is replaced by that of its Ln-norm. One of the key
arguments in [1] involves touching from below by translation of the singular function |x|−α, for suitably large α,
which is a subsolution of the equation under consideration.

In [9], Imbert and Silvestre establish a Harnack inequality for functions which, at points of large gradient, are

solutions to linear, uniformly elliptic equations

(1.4)

aijvij + b · Dv = f

where the drift b is bounded. The measure estimate in [9] was established by touching the graph of v from below
by translation of the cusps functions of the form −|x|1/2. In [13], Mooney establishes the Harnack inequality for
these equations with Ln drift b. One main contribution of [13] is a new proof of the measure estimate in [9] that
uses sliding of paraboloids from below at all scales and a set decomposition algorithm.

HARNACK INEQUALITY VIA SLIDING PARABOLOIDS

1.2. On doubling estimate. An attractive feature in Mooney’s proof of the doubling estimate for (1.4) in [13]
is to slide barriers ϕ(x), of the form |x|−α for suitably large α, from below until they touch the graph of v and
use the equation at the contact points. The barriers are indeed subsolutions of (1.4) when the drift b and the
nonhomogeneous term f are bounded. One subtle point in this method is the translation invariant property of
barriers. Roughly speaking, this says that if

then we also have

aij (x)ϕij (x − y) ≥ 1 in B3(0) \ B2(0) for y ∈ B1(0).

aij(x)ϕij (x) ≥ 1 in B4(0) \ B1(0)

This property holds for uniformly elliptic equations like (1.4) with (aij) satisfying (1.2) while it does not hold for
degenerate elliptic equations such as the linearized Monge-Amp`ere equations; see (1.7) in the next section.

1.3. Doubling estimate via sliding paraboloids. Motivated by Mooney’s approach to the doubling estimate
and Savin’s sliding paraboloid method in obtaining the measure estimates, we slide generalized paraboloids (see
Deﬁnition 2.2) from below to obtain the doubling estimate for linear, degenerate and singular elliptic equations
that include uniformly elliptic equations as in Krylov-Safonov’s theory [11] and linearized Monge-Amp`ere equations
as in Caﬀarelli-Guti´errez’s theory [5]. This in turn also works for equations with unbounded lower order terms.
The integrability assumptions on the lower terms are similar to those of uniformly elliptic equations studied in the
work of Trudinger [17].

The key observation is simple: if v is a nonnegative supersolution of an elliptic equation aij vij ≤ 0 then −v−ε
is also a supersolution. This property does not depend on the ellipticity of the coeﬃcient matrix (aij ). Thus, we
can slide (generalized) paraboloids from below to touch the graph of −v−ε. However, due to the degeneracy and
singularity nature of the equations considered in this paper, in order to obtain the doubling estimate, we need
to modify the paraboloids by certain convex function at points where there is a lack of uniform ellipticity. This
modiﬁcation is also needed in the traditional proof using subsolution construction; see the function hε and hδ in
the proofs of Lemmas 4.2 and 4.1.

Our argument also applies to functions which are solutions to equations of linearized Monge-Amp`ere type, but

only at points where the gradient is large; see Remark 4.3 and Lemma 4.4.

1.4. Harnack inequality via sliding paraboloids. Combining our new argument in establishing the doubling
estimate with Savin’s measure estimates, we can prove a Harnack inequality for linear, degenerate and singular
elliptic equations with unbounded lower order terms via the method of sliding paraboloids. We hope that this
uniﬁed treatment of the estimates in proving Harnack inequality will have further applications in degenerate
equations.

1.5. Statement of the main result. We now state precisely the main result proved in this paper. Let λ, Λ, ˜λ
and ˜Λ be given positive constants with λ ≤ Λ and ˜λ ≤ ˜Λ. Let Ω ⊂ Rn be an open, convex and bounded domain.
Assume that a strictly convex function u satisﬁes the Monge-Amp`ere equation

(1.5)

λ ≤ det D2u ≤ Λ in Ω

in the sense of Aleksandrov; see, for example, Guti´errez [8, Deﬁnition 1.2.1]. Then u ∈ C1,α∗ for some α∗ depending
only on n, λ, Λ; see, for example [8, Theorem 5.4.5] and Theorem 2.13 in Section 2. Throughout, we denote the
cofactor matrix of the Hessian matrix D2u = (uij)1≤i,j≤n by

U = (det D2u)(D2u)−1 ≡ (U ij )1≤i,j≤n.

Let A = (aij)1≤i,j≤n be a symmetric matrix satisfying
(1.6)

˜λU ≤ A ≤ ˜ΛU.

We will denote by Su(x, h) the section of u centered at x ∈ Ω with height h; see Deﬁnition 2.5.

NAM Q. LE

Our main result is the following Harnack inequality for the linear, degenerate and singular elliptic equations,
which are (D2u)−1-like, with unbounded lower order terms. By abuse of terminology, we call these equations
linearized Monge-Amp`ere equations associated with the potential u.

Theorem 1.1 (Harnack inequality). Assume that (1.5) and (1.6) are satisﬁed in Ω. Suppose that v ≥ 0 is a
W 2,n

(1.7)

Remark 1.2. We note that, under the assumption (1.5), D2u is not bounded and thus (1.7), though elliptic, can
be both degenerate and singular. In fact, the best regularity we can have from (1.5) only is D2u ∈ L1+ε(Ω) where ε
is a small constant depending on n, λ and Λ. This follows from De Philippis-Figalli-Savin’s and Schmidt’s interior
W 2,1+ε estimates [6, 16] for the Monge-Amp`ere equation.
Remark 1.3.

(i) We will sometimes use (1.7) in the form trace(AD2v) + b · Dv + cv = f.
(ii) When u = 1
In this case, we can take α∗ = 1.
(iii) When ˜λ = ˜Λ = 1, A = U and (1.7) becomes a linearized Monge-Amp`ere equation with lower order terms.

2 |x|2, U = In and (1.7) becomes a linear, uniformly elliptic equations in non-divergence form.

Remark 1.4. When b = 0 and c = 0, we can take h0 = ∞ and N (h, h0) = 1 in Theorem 1.1. In this case,
Theorem 1.1 was discovered in the fundamental work of Caﬀarelli-Guti´errez [5, Theorem 5] for f = 0 with the
extension to the nonhomogeneous case by Trudinger-Wang [18, Theorem 3.4].

Theorem 1.1 is also related to a recent paper by Maldonado [12]. In [12], Maldonado established an interior
Harnack inequality for nonnegative solutions to the nonhomogeneous linearized Monge-Amp`ere equation with lower
order terms where the drift term has a special structure and the coeﬃcient c has a sign. Certain boundedness on
the lower order term was assumed. More precisely, Maldonado considered equations of the type

(1.9)

trace(cid:0)(D2u)−1D2v(cid:1) + b ·(cid:16)(D2u)−1/2Dv(cid:17) + cv = f.

Here u is a strictly convex, twice continuously diﬀerentiable function on Rn whose associated Monge-Amp`ere
measure µu(x) := det D2u(x)dx is stricly positive and satisﬁes a doubling property; the functions b, c, f satisfy

b, c, f ∈ L∞; c ≤ 0; and (D2u)−1/2b ∈ Ln.

These conditions on the lower order terms allow the use of the ABP maximum principle to (1.9). The Harnack
inequality in [12] extends the fundamental work of Caﬀarelli-Guti´errez [5] in the case with no lower order terms
and the Monge-Amp`ere measure µu(x) satisﬁes the (µ∞)-condition which is stronger than the doubling condition.
The proof of Harnack inequality in [12] was proved by means of real analysis techniques in spaces of homogeneous
type. These include exploiting the variational structure of (1.9), local-BMO estimates and Poincar´e-type inequality
within the Monge-Amp`ere quasi-metric structure. This proof diﬀers from that in [5] and in this paper. Here, we
also slide paraboloids and then using normalization techniques as in [5].

Remark 1.5. We require the high integrability of the drift term b in Theorem 1.1 in order to obtain a small
Ln-norm of the rescaled drift when we rescale (1.7); see Section 5.2 and Lemma 5.2. This will allow us to apply
the measure estimate in Lemma 3.1 and the doubling estimate in Lemma 4.1 to the rescaled equation.

Remark 1.6. We expect that the measure localization technique of Safonov [14] can be combined with the sliding
paraboloids argument in this paper to prove the Harnack inequality for solutions to (1.7) when b ∈ L
seems that new method is required to establish the Harnack inequality for (1.7) when b ∈ Ln.

In this paper, a positive constant depending only on p, λ, Λ, ˜λ, ˜Λ and the dimension n of Rn is called universal.
We denote universal constants by c1, C, C1, C2, K, M, δ, · · · , etc, and their values may change from line to line. We
use C(·, ·) to emphasize the dependence of C on the parameters in the parentheses. Universal constants in Sections

3 and 4 do not depend on p. Repeated indices are summed, such as aij vij =Pn

We can assume that all functions u, v in this paper are smooth and thus solutions can be interpreted in the
classical sense. However, our estimates do not depend on the assumed smoothness but only on the given structural
constants. Thus, by a standard approximation argument (see, for example [7, Section 9.1]), our estimates also hold
for v ∈ W 2,n

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present some notation and background results
needed in the rest of the paper. The following sections of the paper use these results but otherwise are self-contained
and quite elementary. We prove the measure estimate, Lemma 3.1, in Section 3. In Section 4, we prove the doubling
estimate, Lemma 4.1. In Section 5, we prove the power decay estimate, Theorem 5.3. Theorem 1.1 will be proved
in the ﬁnal Section 6.

2. Preliminaries

In this section, we present some notation and background results needed in the rest of the paper. These
include generalized paraboloid associated with a convex function, section of a convex function, the Aleksandrov
maximum principle, John’s lemma, basic linear algebra facts, key geometric properties of solutions to the Monge-
Amp`ere equation, the Vitali covering lemma and the growing ink-spots lemma in the context of the Monge-Amp`ere
equation.

2.2. Basic deﬁnitions.

Deﬁnition 2.1 (Paraboloid). A paraboloid P of opening a and vertex y ∈ Rn is a quadratic function of the form

for some constant C ∈ R.

P (x) = C −

|x − y|2

Deﬁnition 2.2 (Generalized paraboloid). A generalized paraboloid P , associated with a convex, C1 function u,
of opening a and vertex y ∈ Rn is a function of the form

P (x) = C − a[u(x) − u(y) − Du(y) · (x − y)]

for some constant C ∈ R.

Clearly, Deﬁnition 2.1 is a special case of Deﬁnition 2.2 with u(x) = 1
We will frequently use the following lemma, due to Fritz John [10, Theorem 3].

2 |x|2.

Lemma 2.3 (John’s lemma). Let Ω ⊂ Rn be a compact, convex set with nonempty interior. Then there is an
aﬃne transformation T x = Ax + b where the n × n matrix A is invertible and b ∈ Rn such that

In Lemma 2.3, the transformation T is said to normalize Ω.

B1(0) ⊂ T (Ω) ⊂ Bn(0).

Deﬁnition 2.4 (Normalized convex set). We say that a convex set Ω ⊂ Rn is normalized if B1(0) ⊂ Ω ⊂ Bn(0).

A central notion in the theory of Monge-Amp`ere equation is that of sections, introduced and investigated by

Caﬀarelli; see, for example [3]. They will play the role that balls do in the uniformly elliptic equations.

Deﬁnition 2.5 (Section). Let u ∈ C1(Ω) ∩ C(Ω) be a convex function in Ω. The section of u centered at x with
height h, denoted by Su(x, h), is deﬁned by

Su(x, h) = {y ∈ Ω : u(y) < u(x) + Du(x) · (y − x) + h}.

If u(x) = 1

2 |x|2 in Ω then Su(x, h) = B√2h(x) ∩ Ω.

2.3. Some useful estimates. We will use the following gradient estimate for a convex function.

Lemma 2.6 (Gradient estimate). Let Ω ⊂ Rn be a bounded convex set and u ∈ C1(Ω) ∩ C(Ω) a convex function
in Ω. If x ∈ Ω, then

|Du(x)| ≤

maxy∈∂Ω u(y) − u(x)

dist(x, ∂Ω)

.

Proof of Lemma 2.6. We include here a simple proof for reader’s convenience. Let r := dist(x, ∂Ω). Then, for each
ε > 0, y0 = x + r Du(x)

|Du(x)|+ε ∈ Ω. Hence, by convexity

Thus

u(y) ≥ u(y0) ≥ u(x) + Du(x) · (y0 − x) = u(x) + r

dist(x, ∂Ω)

and by letting ε → 0, we obtain the desired estimate.

(cid:3)

We recall the Aleksandrov maximum principle; see for example [8, Theorem 1.4.2].

Theorem 2.7 (Aleksandrov maximum principle). Let Ω ⊂ Rn be a bounded, open and convex set, and u ∈ C(Ω)
a convex function with u = 0 on ∂Ω. Then, for all x0 ∈ Ω, we have

|u(x0)|n ≤ C(n)[diam(Ω)]n−1dist(x0, ∂Ω)ZΩ

We will use the following linear algebra lemma.

Lemma 2.8 (Matrix inequalities). Assume that A, B ∈ Sn.

Proof of Lemma 2.8. The proof of (a) is standard so we omit it.
(b) Let In ∈ Sn be the identity matrix. Since B is positive deﬁnite, we can rewrite the hypotheses as

B−1/2AB−1/2 ≥ −aIn, and trace(B−1/2AB−1/2) ≤ D.

Hence

B−1/2AB−1/2 ≤ [a(n − 1) + D]In ≤ (an + D)In

and therefore, we obtain A ≤ (an + D)B as asserted.
(c) Let P be an orthogonal matrix such that A = P DP t where D is the diagonal matrix:

D = diag(λ1, · · · , λn).

Then

trace(A−1) = trace(D−1) and aijbibj = (Ab) · b = (P DP tb) · b = (DP tb) · (P tb).

Because |P tb| = |b|, it suﬃces to prove the lemma for the case A = D = diag(λ1, · · · , λn). In this case, the lemma
is equivalent to proving the obvious inequality:

2.4. Review on the Monge-Amp`ere equation. Most of the results in this section are taken from Guti´errez
[8]. We assume throughout this Section 2.4 that u is a strictly convex solution to the Monge-Amp`ere equation

λ ≤ det D2u ≤ Λ in an open, bounded and convex domain Ω ⊂ Rn.

We will use the following volume growth for compactly supported sections; see ([8, Corollary 3.2.4].

Lemma 2.9 (Volume estimate for section). Suppose that Su(x, h) ⊂⊂ Ω. Then

[C(n, λ, Λ)]−1hn/2 ≤ |Su(x, h)| ≤ C(n, λ, Λ)hn/2.

We will use the engulﬁng property of sections; see [8, Theorem 3.3.7].

Theorem 2.10 (Engulﬁng property of sections). There is a universal constant θ0(n, λ, Λ) > 2 with the following
property: If Su(y, 2h) ⊂⊂ Ω and x ∈ Su(y, h), then we have Su(y, h) ⊂ Su(x, θ0h).

We will use the following estimate on the size of sections; see [8, Theorem 3.3.8].

Theorem 2.11 (Size of section). Suppose that Su(0, t0) ⊂⊂ Ω is a normalized section, that is, B1(0) ⊂ Su(0, t0) ⊂
Bn(0). Then there are universal constants µ(n, λ, Λ) ∈ (0, 1) and C(n, λ, Λ) such that for all sections Su(x, h) ⊂⊂ Ω
with x ∈ Su(0, 3/4t0), we have

Su(x, h) ⊂ BChµ(x).

We will use the following inclusion and exclusion property of sections; see [8, Theorem 3.3.10].

8

NAM Q. LE

Theorem 2.12 (Inclusion and exclusion property of sections). There exist universal constants c0(n, λ, λ) > 0 and
p1(n, λ, Λ) ≥ 1 such that

(i) if 0 < r < s ≤ 1 and x1 ∈ Su(x0, rt) where Su(x0, 2t) ⊂⊂ Ω, then

Su(x1, c0(s − r)p1 t) ⊂ Su(x0, st);

(ii) if 0 < r < s < 1 and x1 ∈ Su(x0, t)\Su(x0, st) where Su(x0, 2t) ⊂⊂ Ω, then

Su(x1, c0(s − r)p1 t) ∩ Su(x0, rt) = ∅.

In fact, we can choose p1 = (n + 1)µ−1 where µ is the constant in Theorem 2.11.

We recall the C1,α∗ regularity property of strictly convex solution to the Monge-Amp`ere equation; see [8,

Theorem 5.4.5].

Theorem 2.13 (C1,α∗ regularity). There exists a universal constant α∗(n, λ, Λ) ∈ (0, 1] such that u is C1,α∗ (Ω).
More quantitatively, if Su(x0, t) ⊂⊂ Ω is a normalized section and x, y ∈ Su(x0, t/2) then

|Du(x) − Du(y)| ≤ C(n, λ, Λ)|x − y|α∗.

Lemma 2.14. There exist universal constants K(n, λ, Λ), ˆK(n, λ, Λ) > 1 with the following properties:

(i) Let θ0 be as in Theorem 2.10. If

Su(x1, 4θ0h1), Su(x2, 4θ0h2) ⊂⊂ Ω, Su(x1, h1) ∩ Su(x2, h2) 6= ∅ and 2h1 ≥ h2

then

(ii) If Su(x, t) ⊂ Su(y, h) where Su(y, ˆKh) ⊂⊂ Ω then Su(x, Kt) ⊂ Su(y, ˆKh).

Su(x2, h2) ⊂ Su(x1, Kh1).

Proof of Lemma 2.14. (i) We can choose K = 2θ2
0. Indeed, suppose that x ∈ Su(x1, h1) ∩ Su(x2, h2) and 2h1 ≥ h2
where Su(x1, 4θ0h1), Su(x2, 4θ0h2) ⊂⊂ Ω. Then, by the engulﬁng property of sections in Theorem 2.10, Su(x2, h2) ⊂
Su(x, θ0h2) ⊂ Su(x, 2θ0h1) and x1 ∈ Su(x1, h1) ⊂ Su(x, 2θ0h1). Again, by the engulﬁng property, we have
Su(x, 2θ0h1) ⊂ Su(x1, 2θ2
(ii) The existence of ˆK is due to Lemma 2.9 and Theorem 2.12. Indeed, by Lemma 2.9, the inclusion Su(x, t) ⊂
Su(y, h) ⊂⊂ Ω implies that t ≤ C(n, λ, Λ)h. From x ∈ Su(y, ˆKh) ⊂⊂ Ω and Theorem 2.12, we can ﬁnd c1(n, λ, Λ)
small, universally such that Su(x, c1 ˆKh) ⊂ Su(y, ˆKh). Thus it suﬃces to choose ˆK = KCc−1
to get Su(x, Kt) ⊂

Su(y, ˆKh).

0h1) ≡ Su(x1, Kh1).

2.5. Vitali covering lemma. In the context of the Monge-Amp`ere equation, we have the following Vitali covering
lemma; see also [6, Lemma 1].

Lemma 2.15 (Vitali covering). Suppose that u is a strictly convex solution to the Monge-Amp`ere equation λ ≤
det D2u ≤ Λ in a bounded and convex set Ω ⊂ Rn. Let θ0 and K be as in Theorem 2.10 and Lemma 2.14,
respectively.

(i) Let S be a collection of sections Sx = Su(x, h(x)) where Su(x, 4θ0h(x)) ⊂⊂ Ω. Then there exists a

For reader’s convenience, we include its standard proof using the engulﬁng property of sections of solutions to

the Monge-Amp`ere equation.

Proof of Lemma 2.15. (i) From the volume estimate for sections in Lemma 2.9 and Su(x, h(x)) ⊂⊂ Ω, we ﬁnd that

We deﬁne Fi ⊂ Si as follows. Let F1 be any maximal disjoint collection of sections in S1. By the volume estimate
in Lemma 2.9, F1 is ﬁnite. Assuming F1, · · · , Fk−1 have been selected, we choose Fk to be any maximal disjoint

Each Fk is again a ﬁnite set.

We claim that the countable subcollection of disjoint sections Su(xi, h(xi)) where Sxi ∈ F :=

Fk satisﬁes

the conclusion of the lemma. To see this, it suﬃces to show that for any section Sx ∈ S, there exists a section
Sy ∈ F such that Sx ∩ Sy 6= ∅ and Sx ⊂ Su(y, Kh(y)). The proof of this fact is simple. There is an index j such

that Sx ⊂ Sj . By the maximality of Fj, there is a section Sy ∈

Fk with Sx ∩ Sy 6= ∅. Because h(y) > H

2j and

2j−1 , we have h(x) ≤ 2h(y). By Lemma 2.14, we have Sx ⊂ Su(y, Kh(y)).

h(x) ≤ H

By the compactness of D, we can choose a ﬁnite number of sections Su(xi, h(xi)) (i = 1, · · · , m) which cover D. (cid:3)

2.6. Growing ink-spots lemma. In the proof of the power decay estimate in Theorem 5.3, we use the following
consequence of Vitali’s covering lemma. It is often referred to as the growing ink-spots lemma which was ﬁrst
introduced by Krylov-Safonov [11]; see also Imbert-Silvestre [9, Lemma 2.1]. The term ”growing ink-spots lemma“
was coined by E. M. Landis.

Lemma 2.16 (Growing ink-spots lemma). Suppose that u is a strictly convex solution to the Monge-Amp`ere
equation λ ≤ det D2u ≤ Λ in a bounded and convex set Ω ⊂ Rn. Let ˆK be as in Lemma 2.14. Assume that for
some h > 0, Su(0, ˆKh) ⊂⊂ Ω.

Let E ⊂ F ⊂ Su(0, h) be two open sets. Assume that for some constant δ ∈ (0, 1), the following two assumptions

are satisﬁed:

(i) If any section Su(x, t) ⊂ Su(0, h) satisﬁes |Su(x, t) ∩ E| > (1 − δ)|Su(x, t)|, then Su(x, t) ⊂ F ;
(ii) |E| ≤ (1 − δ)|Su(0, h)|.

Then |E| ≤ (1 − c2δ)|F | for some constant c2 depending only on n, λ and Λ.

Proof of Lemma 2.16. The proof here follows the line of argument in Imbert-Silvestre [9] in the case u(x) = 1
2 |x|2.
For every x ∈ F , since F is open, there exists some maximal section which is contained in F and contains x. We
choose one of those sections for each x ∈ F and call it Su(x, ¯h(x)).

If Su(x, ¯h(x)) = Su(0, h) for any x ∈ F , then the conclusion of the lemma follows immediately since |E| ≤

(1 − δ)|Su(0, h)| by (ii) and F = Su(0, h) in this case, so let us assume that this is not the case here.

10

NAM Q. LE

We claim that |Su(x, ¯h(x)) ∩ E| ≤ (1 − δ)|Su(x, ¯h(x))|. Otherwise, we could ﬁnd a slightly larger section ˜S

containing Su(x, ¯h(x)) such that | ˜S ∩ E| > (1 − δ)| ˜S| and ˜S 6⊂ F , contradicting (i).

The family of sections Su(x, ¯h(x)) covers the set F . Let θ0 be as in Theorem 2.10 and K as in Lemma 2.14.

Note that, by Lemma 2.14 and K = 2θ2

0 > 4θ0, we have

Su(x, 4θ0¯h(x)) ⊂ Su(x, K¯h(x)) ⊂ Su(0, ˆKh) ⊂⊂ Ω.

By the Vitali covering Lemma 2.15, we can select a subcollection of disjoint sections Sj := Su(xj , ¯h(xj)) such that

F ⊂

∞

[j=1

Su(xj , K¯h(xj )).

The volume estimates in Lemma 2.9 then imply that, for each j, we have

|Su(xj , K¯h(xj ))| ≤ C(n, λ, Λ)|Su(xj , ¯h(xj))|.

By construction, Sj ⊂ F and |Sj ∩ E| ≤ (1 − δ)|Sj|. Thus, we have that |Sj ∩ (F \ E)| ≥ δ|Sj|. Therefore

|F \ E| ≥

3. Measure estimate and sliding paraboloids from below

In this section, we prove the measure estimate for supersolution of (1.7) by sliding paraboloids from below. Our

measure estimate states as follows.

Lemma 3.1 (Measure estimate). Assume that (1.5) and (1.6) are satisﬁed in Ω. Suppose that v ≥ 0 is a W 2,n
solution of

loc (Ω)

(3.10)

aij vij + b · Dv + cv ≤ f

in a normalized section Su(0, 4t0) ⊂⊂ Ω. There are small, universal constants δ1 > 0, α1(n, λ, Λ) > 0, ε1 > 0 and
a large, universal constant M1(n, λ, Λ) > 1 with the following properties. If

and

then

inf

Su(0,α1t0)

v ≤ 1

kbkLn(Su(0,4t0)) + kc−kLn(Su(0,4t0)) + kf +kLn(Su(0,4t0)) ≤ ε1

|{v > M1} ∩ Su(0, t0)| ≤ (1 − δ1)|Su(0, t0)|.

Proof of Lemma 3.1. Since B1(0) ⊂ Su(0, 4t0) ⊂ Bn(0), and Su(0, 4t0) ⊂⊂ Ω, the volume estimates in Lemma 2.9
give that

C1(n, λ, Λ)−1 ≤ t0 ≤ C1(n, λ, Λ).

Our proof below uses this range of t0 but not its speciﬁc value, so we can assume without loss of generality that
t0 = 1. Denote for simplicity St = Su(0, t) for t > 0.
Suppose v(x0) ≤ 1 at x0 ∈ Sα1 where α1 ∈ (0, 1/8). Consider the set of vertices V = Sα1. For each y ∈ V , we
slide the generalized paraboloids −a[u(x) − Du(y) · (x − y) − u(y)] + Cy of opening a > 0 until they touch the graph

HARNACK INEQUALITY VIA SLIDING PARABOLOIDS

11

of v from below at some point x ∈ S1, called the contact point. In terms of the notation ﬁrst introduced in [15], we
deﬁne the contact set by

Aa(V, u, S1, v) = {x ∈ S1 : there is y ∈ V such that inf
S1

(v + a[u(·) − Du(y) · (· − y) − u(y)])

= v(x) + a[u(x) − Du(y) · (x − y) − u(y)]}.

Claim. There exists a large, universal constant a(n, λ, Λ) such that

Aa(V, u, S1, v) ⊂ S1.

Indeed, for each y ∈ V , we consider the function

P (x) = v(x) + a[u(x) − Du(y) · (x − y) − u(y)]

and look for its minimum points on S1. Because y ∈ Sα1 ⊂ S1/8, we can use Theorem 2.12 to get a universal
constant c1(n, λ, Λ) such that Su(y, c1) ⊂ S1. Therefore, if x ∈ ∂S1, then we have

(3.11)

P (x) ≥ a[u(x) − Du(y) · (x − y) − u(y)] ≥ ac1(n, λ, Λ).

Let θ0(n, λ, Λ) be the universal constant in Theorem 2.10. Then, at x0, we have

(3.12)

P (x0) ≤ 1 + a[u(x0) − Du(y) · (x0 − y) − u(y)] ≤ 1 + aα1θ0.

The last inequality follows from the engulﬁng property. Indeed, we have x0, y ∈ Sα1 and hence by the engulﬁng
property of sections in Theorem 2.10, x0, y ∈ Su(0, α1) ⊂ Su(y, θ0α1). Consequently,

u(x0) − Du(y) · (x0 − y) − u(y) ≤ θ0α1.

Fix α1(n, λ, Λ) > 0 small, universal and a, M1 large depending only on n, λ and Λ, such that

(3.13)

M1 = 2 + aα1θ0 < ac1.

Then, from (3.11) and (3.12), we deduce that P attains its minimum on S1 at a point x ∈ S1. Hence Aa(V, u, S1, v) ⊂
S1, proving the Claim.

In the above argument, we ﬁnd from (3.12) and (3.13) that

(3.14)

v(x) ≤ P (x0) < M1 for all x ∈ Aa(V, u, S1, v).

Now, for each vertex y ∈ V , we look at the contact point x ∈ S1, that is

v(x) + a[u(x) − Du(y) · (x − y) − u(y)] ≤ v(z) + a[u(z) − Du(y) · (z − y) − u(y)] for all z ∈ S1.

Then

which gives

(3.15)

Dv(x) = a(Du(y) − Du(x))

Du(y) = Du(x) +

1
a

Dv(x)

and, from the gradient estimate in Lemma 2.6,

(3.16)

|Dv(x)| ≤ aC(n, λ, Λ).

From the minimality of P at x, we have

(3.17)

D2v(x) ≥ −aD2u(x).

Hence, upon diﬀerentiating (3.15) with respect to x, we ﬁnd

(3.18)

Using (1.6) and (3.17) at x, we have

D2u(y)Dxy = D2u(x) +

1
a

D2v(x) ≥ 0.

˜λU ij(vij + auij) ≤ aij (vij + auij)

from which we deduce that

na˜λ + ˜λtrace((D2u)−1D2v) ≤ (det D2u(x))−1[aijvij + aaijuij] ≤ (det D2u(x))−1aij vij + an˜Λ.

It follows that

trace((D2u)−1D2v) ≤ ˜λ−1(det D2u(x))−1aij vij + an[˜Λ/˜λ − 1].

Now using the equation (3.10) only at x, that is

trace(AD2v) ≤ f − b · Dv − cv ≤ f +(x) + |b(x)||Dv(x)| + c−(x)v(x),

and recalling det D2u(x) ≥ λ by (1.5), we ﬁnd that

Combining this with (3.17) and the basic estimates in Lemma 2.8 (b), we ﬁnd

trace((D2u)−1D2v(x)) ≤ ˜λ−1λ−1(cid:0)|b(x)||Dv(x)| + c−(x)v(x) + f +(x)(cid:1) + an[˜Λ/˜λ − 1].
− aD2u(x) ≤ D2v(x) ≤ haC(n, ˜λ, ˜Λ) + ˜λ−1λ−1(cid:0)|b(x)||Dv(x)| + c−(x)v(x) + f +(x)(cid:1)i D2u(x)

≤ aC(n, λ, Λ, ˜λ, ˜Λ)(1 + |b(x)| + c−(x) + f +(x))D2u(x).

(3.19)

Now, taking the determinant in (3.18) and invoking (3.19), we obtain

det D2u(y) det Dxy = det(D2u(x) +

1
a

D2v(x))

≤ C(n, λ, Λ, ˜λ, ˜Λ)(1 + |b(x)|n + |c−(x)|n + |f +(x)|n) det D2u(x).

This together with (1.5) implies the bound

0 ≤ det Dxy ≤ C(n, Λ, λ, ˜λ, ˜Λ)(1 + |b(x)|n + |c−(x)|n + |f +(x)|n).

Recall from (3.14) that, v < M1 on the set E := Aa(V, u, S1, v) of contact points. Moreover, by deﬁnition, E is a
closed set and thus measurable. By the area formula, we have

|Sα1 | = |V | =ZE

|det Dxy| ≤ C(n, Λ, λ, ˜λ, ˜Λ)(cid:16)|E| + kbkn

≤ C(n, λ, Λ, ˜λ, ˜Λ)|{v < M1} ∩ S1| + C(n, λ, Λ, ˜λ, ˜Λ)εn

If ε1 is small, universal, then C(n, λ, Λ, ˜λ, ˜Λ)εn
thus

1 ≤ |Sα1 |/2 by the volume estimate of sections in Lemma 2.9 and

Then, using the volume estimate of sections in Lemma 2.9, we ﬁnd that

|Sα1| ≤ 2C(n, λ, Λ, ˜λ, ˜Λ)|{v < M1} ∩ S1|.

|S1| ≤ C∗|{v < M1} ∩ S1|

for some C∗ > 1 universal. The conclusion of the Lemma holds with δ1 = 1/C∗.

(cid:3)

4. Doubling estimate and sliding paraboloids from below

In this section, we prove the doubling estimate for supersolution of (1.7) by sliding paraboloids from below. The

key doubling estimate is the following lemma.

Lemma 4.1 (Doubling estimate). Assume that (1.5) and (1.6) are satisﬁed in Ω. Suppose that v ≥ 0 is a W 2,n
solution of

loc (Ω)

(4.20)

aij vij + b · Dv + cv ≤ f

in a normalized section Su(0, 4t0) ⊂⊂ Ω. Let α ∈ (0, 1/8). There is a small constant ε2 depending only on
n, λ, Λ, ˜λ, ˜Λ and α so that if

and if v ≤ 1 at some point in Su(0, t0) then v ≤ M2(n, Λ, λ, ˜λ, ˜Λ, α) in Su(0, αt0).

kbkLn(Su(0,4t0)) + kc−kLn(Su(0,4t0)) + kf +kLn(Su(0,4t0)) ≤ ε2

HARNACK INEQUALITY VIA SLIDING PARABOLOIDS

13

A simpler version of Lemma 4.1 is the following:

Lemma 4.2 (Doubling estimate for equations without lower order terms). Assume that (1.5) is satisﬁed in Ω.
Suppose that v ≥ 0 is a W 2,n
loc (Ω) solution of U ij vij ≤ 0 in a normalized section S4 := Su(0, 4) ⊂⊂ Ω. Denote for
simplicity St = Su(0, t) for t > 0. Let α ∈ (0, 1/8). If v ≥ 1 in Sα then v ≥ c(n, Λ, λ, α) in S1.

For reader’s convenience, we present a proof of Lemma 4.2 using the traditional construction of barriers. Another
purpose in giving this proof is to motivate the introduction of the modiﬁcation functions hε and hδ in the proof of
Lemma 4.1. We do not need these functions in the uniformly elliptic equations (such as (1.7) with u(x) = 1
2 |x|2)
but they seem to be unavoidable in the degenerate and singular equations.

Proof of Lemma 4.2. Subtracting an aﬃne function from u, we can assume that u ≥ 0, u(0) = 0, Du(0) = 0.
Recall that B1(0) ⊂ Su(0, 4) ⊂ Bn(0). To prove the lemma, it suﬃces to construct a subsolution w : S2\Sα −→ R,
i.e., U ijwij ≥ 0, with the following properties:

w ≤ 0 on ∂S2, w ≤ 1 on ∂Sα, w ≥ c(n, Λ, λ, α) in S1\Sα.

Our ﬁrst guess is

w = C(α, m)(u−m − 2−m)

where m is large, depending only on n, λ, Λ and α.

Let (uij)1≤i,j≤n be the inverse matrix (D2u)−1 of the Hessian matrix D2u. We can compute for W = u−m −2−m

(4.21)

uijWij = mu−m−2[(m + 1)uijuiuj − uuijuij] = mu−m−2[(m + 1)uijuiuj − nu].

By Lemma 2.8(c)

(4.22)

uijuiuj ≥

|Du|2

trace(D2u)

.

If x ∈ S2 \ Sα and y = 0 then from from the convexity of u, we have 0 = u(y) ≥ u(x) + Du(x) · (0 − x) and therefore,

(4.23)

|Du(x)| ≥

u(x)
|x|

≥

α
n

≡ 2c0(n, α) on S2 \ Sα.

In view of (4.22) and (4.23), it is clear that in order to obtain uijWij ≥ 0 using (4.21), we only have trouble when
kD2uk is unbounded. But the set of bad points, i.e., where kD2uk is large, is small. Here is how we see this.
Because Su(0, 4) is normalized, we can deduce from Aleksandrov maximum principle, Theorem 2.7 applied to u − 4,
that

dist(Su(0, 3), ∂Su(0, 4)) ≥ c1(n, λ, Λ)

for some universal c1(n, λ, Λ) > 0. By Lemma 2.6, Du is bounded on S3. Now let ν denote the outernormal unit
vector ﬁeld on ∂S3. Then, using the convexity of u, we have kD2uk ≤ ∆u. Thus, by the divergence theorem,

ZS3

kD2uk ≤ZS3

∆u =Z∂S3

∂u
∂ν

≤ C(n, λ, Λ).

Therefore, given ε > 0 small, the set

has measure bounded from above by

Hε = {x ∈ S3 | kD2uk ≥

1
ε

}.

|Hε| ≤ Cε.

To construct a proper subsolution bypassing the bad points in Hε, we only need to modify w at bad points. Roughly
speaking, the modiﬁcation involves the convex solution to

det D2uε = 2nΛχHε , uε = 0 on ∂S4.

Here we use χE to denote the characteristic function of the set E: χE(x) = 1 if x ∈ E and χE(x) = 0 if otherwise.
The problem with this equation is that the solution is not in general smooth while we need two derivatives to

14

NAM Q. LE

construct the subsolution. But this smoothness problem can be ﬁxed, using approximation as in the proof of the
doubling estimate in Caﬀarelli-Guti´errez [5, Theorem 2], as follows.

We approximate Hε by an open set ˜Hε where Hε ⊂ ˜Hε ⊂ S4 and the measure of their diﬀerence is small, that is

| ˜Hε \ Hε| ≤ ε.

We introduce a smooth function ϕ with the following properties:

ϕ = 1 in Hε, ϕ = ε in S4 \ ˜Hε, ε ≤ ϕ ≤ 1 in S4.

Let hε be the convex solution to

(4.24)

det D2hε = 2nΛϕ, hε = 0 on ∂S4.

Note that hε ≤ 0 in S4. Since the right hand side 2nΛϕ of the above equation is smooth and strictly positive, by the
C2,α estimates for the Monge-Amp`ere equation (see, for example, Caﬀarelli [3, Theorem 2]), we have hε ∈ C2,α(S4)
for all α ∈ (0, 1). From the Aleksandrov maximum principle, Theorem 2.7, we have on S4

We need to estimate the above right hand side. From the deﬁnitions of ˜Hε and ϕ, we can estimate

|hε| ≤ Cndiam(S4)(cid:18)ZS4

2nΛϕ(cid:19)1/n

.

ZS4

ϕ =ZHε

+Z ˜Hε\Hε

ϕ +ZS4\ ˜Hε

ε ≤ |Hε| + | ˜Hε \ Hε| + εC(n, λ, Λ) ≤ C(n, λ, Λ)ε.

It follows that for some universal constant C1(n, λ, Λ),

(4.25)

|hε| ≤ C1(n, λ, Λ)ε1/n on S4.

By the gradient estimate in Lemma 2.6, we have on S2

(4.26)

We choose ε small so that

(4.27)

Let

|Dhε(x)| ≤

−hε(x)

dist(S3, ∂S4)

≤ C2(n, λ, Λ)ε1/n.

C1(n, λ, Λ)ε1/n ≤ 1/4, C2(n, λ, Λ)ε1/n ≤ c0(n, α).

˜V = (u − hε) and ˜W = ˜V −m − 2−m.

Then, from (4.23), (4.25)-(4.27), we have

(4.28)

| ˜V | ≤ 3 and |D ˜V | ≥ c0(n, α) on S2 \ Sα; α ≤ ˜V ≤ 1 + 1/4 < 5/4 on S1\Sα.

Now, compute as before

uij ˜Wij = m ˜V −m−2[(m + 1)uij ˜Vi ˜Vj − ˜V uij ˜Vij ] = m ˜V −m−2[(m + 1)uij ˜Vi ˜Vj + ˜V (uij(hε)ij − n)].

We note that, by Lemma 2.8 (a), and (4.24),

uij(hε)ij = trace((D2u)−1D2hε) ≥ n(det(D2u)−1 det D2hε)1/n ≥ 2n on Hε.

It follows that uij ˜Wij ≥ nm ˜V −m−1 on Hε. On (S2 \ Sα)\Hε, we have trace(D2u) ≤ nε−1. Thus, from (4.28) and
Lemma 2.8 (c), we have

uij ˜Wij ≥ m ˜V −m−2[(m + 1)uij ˜Vi ˜Vj − n ˜V ]

≥ m ˜V −m−2[(m + 1)

|D ˜V |2

trace(D2u)

− n ˜V ]

≥ m ˜V −m−2[(m + 1)n−1εc2

0(n, α) − n ˜V ] ≥ 0

if we choose m large, depending only on n, λ, Λ and α. Therefore, uij ˜Wij ≥ 0 on S2 \Sα and hence ˜W = ˜V −m −2−m
is a subsolution to uijvij ≥ 0 on S2 \ Sα.

HARNACK INEQUALITY VIA SLIDING PARABOLOIDS

15

Finally, by (4.28) and ˜W ≤ 0 on ∂S2, we choose a suitable C(α, n, λ, Λ) so that the subsolution of the form

˜w = C(α, n, λ, λ)( ˜V −m − 2−m)

satisﬁes ˜w ≤ 1 on ∂Sα. Now, we obtain the desired universal lower bound for v in S1 from v ≥ ˜w on S1\Sα and
v ≥ 1 on Sα.
(cid:3)

Proof of Lemma 4.1. As in the proof of Lemma 3.1, we can assume that t0 = 1. Denote for simplicity St =
Su(0, t) for t > 0. Then B1(0) ⊂ Su(0, 4) ⊂ Bn(0). Subtracting an aﬃne function from u, we can assume that

u ≥ 0, u(0) = 0, Du(0) = 0.

We argue by contradiction. Assume that v(x0) = 1 at some point x0 ∈ S1 and that v > M2 everywhere in Sα for
some large M2 to be determined. Because Su(0, 4) is normalized, we can deduce from the Aleksandrov maximum
principle, Theorem 2.7 applied to u − 4, that

for some universal c1(n, λ, Λ) > 0. As in the proof of Lemma 4.2, for each δ > 0, the set

dist(Su(0, 3), ∂Su(0, 4)) ≥ c1(n, λ, Λ)

Hδ = {x ∈ S3 | kD2uk ≥

has measure bounded from above by |Hδ| ≤ C(n, λ, Λ)δ. As in the proof of Lemma 4.2, we can construct a convex
function hδ ∈ C(S4) ∩ C2(S4) with the following properties:

det D2hδ = (1 + 2 ˜Λ/˜λ)nΛ in Hδ, hδ = 0 on ∂S4, hδ ≤ 0 in S4,

and, if δ is small, depending only on n, λ, Λ, ˜λ, ˜Λ and α, we have

Note that (i) is possible due to Theorem 2.11 and the C1,α∗ estimate for u in Theorem 2.13. Indeed, if y ∈ Sβ

Let x ∈ S3 be a maximum point of Qy on S3. Then, we have the following claims.

Claim 2. ε[v(x) + 1]−ε−1trace((D2u)−1D2v(x)) ≥ n˜Λ/˜λ.

Claim 5. | det Dxy| ≤ C(n, λ, Λ, ˜λ, ˜Λ, α)[|b(x)|n + |c−(x)|n + |f +(x)|n].

Given these claims, we ﬁnish the proof of the lemma as follows. Denote the contact set by E. Then, since y ∈ Sβ,
we have from Claim 5 and the area formula,

|Sβ| ≤ZE

| det Dxy| ≤ C(cid:16)kbkn

This is a contradiction to the smallness of ε2. The lemma is proved.
We now proceed with the proofs of the claims.
Proof of Claim 1. Claim 1 follows from the following observations:

Ln(E) + kc−kn

Ln(E) + kf +kn

Ln(E)(cid:17) ≤ Cεn

2 .

(a) For all x ∈ ∂S3, we have Qy(x) < Qy(x0).
(b) For all x ∈ Sα, we have Qy(x) < Qy(x0).

Let us consider (a) which is equivalent to

(4.30)

[v(x) + 1]−ε − [v(x0) + 1]−ε ≤

3
4

[u(x) − u(x0) − Du(y) · (x − x0) − hδ(x) + hδ(x0)] for all x ∈ ∂S3.

Suppose x ∈ ∂S3. Then, since x, x0 ∈ S4 ⊂ Bn(0), |x − x0| ≤ 2n. By (4.29) and (i), (4.30) follows from

u(x) − u(x0) − Du(y) · (x − x0) − hδ(x) + hδ(x0) ≥ 2 − |Du(y)||x − x0| −

Suppose x ∈ Sα. We estimate the left hand side of (4.31) from above, using (4.29) and (i), by

Proof of Claim 2. At the maximum point x ∈ S3 \ Sα of Qy, we have the following information:

(c) Dw(x) = 3
(d) D2w(x) ≤ 3

4 [Du(x) − Du(y) − Dhδ(x)],
4 [D2u(x) − D2hδ(x)].

Equation (c) gives Du(y) = Du(x) − Dhδ(x) − 4

3 Dw(x). Diﬀerentiating this expression with respect to x yields

(4.33)

D2u(y)Dxy = D2u(x) − D2hδ(x) −

Moreover, by convexity, (i) and (4.29)

Furthermore, by the gradient estimate for u in Lemma 2.6 and (4.29), we also have an upper bound for Dw(x)

(4.35)

|Dw(x)| ≤ C(n, λ, Λ).

From w(x) = [v(x) + 1]−ε, we ﬁnd

(4.36)
and, with a ⊗ b denoting the matrix (aibj)1≤i,j≤n for a = (a1, · · · , an) ∈ Rn and b = (b1, · · · , bn) ∈ Rn,
(4.37)

D2w(x) = ε(ε + 1)[v(x) + 1]−ε−2Dv(x) ⊗ Dv(x) − ε[v(x) + 1]−ε−1D2v(x).

Dw(x) = −ε[v(x) + 1]−ε−1Dv(x)

It follows from inequality (d) that

Combining this estimate with (4.37), we obtain

There are two cases:
Case 1: x ∈ Hδ. In this case, by Lemma 2.8 (a)

trace((D2u)−1D2hδ(x)) − n ≥ n[det(D2u(x))−1 det D2hδ(x)]1/n − n ≥ (1 + 2 ˜Λ/˜λ)n − n = 2n˜Λ/˜λ

and Claim 2 easily follows from this estimate and (4.38).
Case 2: x ∈ (S3 \ Sα) \ Hδ. Then kD2u(x)k ≤ 1
and (4.34), we ﬁnd

The last inequality follows from (ii). In this case, by recalling (4.38), we see that Claim 2 also follows. In all cases,
we have Claim 2.
Proof of Claim 3. By the maximality of Qy(x), we have Qy(x) ≥ Qy(x0). Therefore, recalling v(x0) = 1, we have

[v(x) + 1]−ε ≥ [v(x0) + 1]−ε −

Recalling (i), (4.29), x0 ∈ S1 and Claim 1, we can estimate

Proof of Claim 4. From Claim 3, we deduce that v(x) is bounded from above

(4.40)

v(x) ≤ C(n, λ, Λ, ˜λ, ˜Λ, α).

Then, by (4.36), |Dv(x)| is also bounded from above, because

(4.41)

|Dv(x)| = ε−1[v(x) + 1]ε+1|Dw(x)| ≤ C(n, λ, Λ, ˜λ, ˜Λ, α).

By (d) and (4.37), we have

From (1.6), we obtain at x

D2u(x) + ε[v(x) + 1]−ε−1D2v(x) ≥ 0.

Hence , from (1.5), we have

ε[v(x) + 1]−ε−1trace((D2u)−1(x)D2v(x)) ≤ ˜λ−1λ−1ε[v(x) + 1]−ε−1trace(AD2v) +

n[˜Λ/˜λ − 1].

3
4

It follows from Claim 2 that

n˜Λ/˜λ ≤ ε[v(x) + 1]−ε−1trace((D2u)−1(x)D2v(x))

≤ ˜λ−1λ−1ε[v(x) + 1]−ε−1trace(AD2v) + n[˜Λ/˜λ − 1].

Therefore,

n˜λλε−1[v(x) + 1]ε+1 ≤ trace(AD2v).

Now using the equation (4.20) only at x, that is

(4.42)

we obtain

trace(AD2v) ≤ f − b · Dv − cv ≤ f +(x) + |b(x)||Dv(x)| + c−(x)v(x),

n˜λλε−1 ≤ f +(x) + |b(x)||Dv(x)| + c−(x)v(x).

Therefore, Claim 4 follows from the upper bounds of v(x) and |Dv(x)| in (4.40) and (4.41).
Proof of Claim 5. From (d) and (1.6), we can use −D2w ≥ − 3

Recalling (4.37), we ﬁnd −D2w(x) ≤ ε[v(x) + 1]−ε−1D2v(x), and hence,

n˜λ + ˜λtrace((D2u)−1(−D2w)) ≤ (det D2u(x))−1ε[v(x) + 1]−ε−1trace(AD2v) +

3

n˜Λ.

3
4

Since det D2u(x) ≥ λ by (1.5), it follows that

trace((D2u(x))−1(−D2w(x))) ≤ ˜λ−1λ−1ε[v(x) + 1]−ε−1trace(AD2v) + n[˜Λ/˜λ − 1].

Now using the equation (4.20) only at x, or (4.42), we ﬁnd that

trace((D2u(x))−1(−D2w(x))) ≤ ˜λ−1ε[v(x) + 1]−ε−1λ−1[|b(x)||Dv(x)| + c−(x)|v(x)| + f +(x)] + n[˜Λ/˜λ − 1].

By Lemma 2.8(b), we deduce that

−D2w(x) ≤ (cid:16)n˜Λ/˜λ + ˜λ−1ε[v(x) + 1]−ε−1λ−1[|b(x)||Dv(x)| + c−(x)v(x) + f +(x)](cid:17) D2u(x)

≤ C(n, λ, Λ, ˜λ, ˜Λ, α)[|b(x)| + c−(x) + f +(x)]D2u(x),

where we used Claim 4 in the last inequality. Recalling (4.33), we get

D2u(y)Dxy ≤ C(n, λ, Λ, ˜λ, ˜Λ, α)[|b(x)| + c−(x) + f +(x)]D2u(x).

Taking the determinant of both sides, and using (1.5), we obtain Claim 5.

(cid:3)

Remark 4.3. From (4.34) and (4.36), we ﬁnd

|Dv(x)| = ε−1[v(x) + 1]ε+1|Dw(x)| ≥

ε−1α
2n

.

Thus the above argument also applies functions that satisfy the equations (4.20) only at points where the gradient
is large.

We record the above remark in the following lemma.

HARNACK INEQUALITY VIA SLIDING PARABOLOIDS

19

Lemma 4.4 (Doubling estimate for degenerate and singular elliptic equations with unbounded drift that hold
only where the gradient is large.). Assume that (1.5) and (1.6) are satisﬁed in Ω. Let α ∈ (0, 1/8). There are
small constants δ2, ε2 depending only on n, λ, Λ, ˜λ, ˜Λ and α with the following properties. Suppose that v ≥ 0 is a
W 2,n
loc (Ω) solution of aijvij + b · Dv + cv ≤ f in a normalized section Su(0, 4t0) ⊂⊂ Ω, but only at points where the
gradient of v is large, that is |Dv| ≥ δ2. If

kbkLn(Su(0,4t0)) + kc−kLn(Su(0,4t0)) + kf +kLn(Su(0,4t0)) ≤ ε2

and if v ≤ 1 at some point in Su(0, t0) then v ≤ M2(n, Λ, λ, ˜λ, ˜Λ, α) in Su(0, αt0).

5. Rescaling and Power decay estimate

In this section, we discuss rescaling of the linearized Monge-Amp`ere equation (1.7) using John’s lemma and

prove a power decay estimate for supersolution of (1.7).

5.1. Critical density estimate. Combining Lemmas 3.1 and 4.1, we obtain the following result:

Proposition 5.1 (Critical density estimate with Ln drift). Assume that (1.5) and (1.6) are satisﬁed in Ω. Suppose
that v ≥ 0 is a W 2,n

loc (Ω) solution of

aij vij + b · Dv + cv ≤ f

in a normalized section Su(0, 4t0) ⊂⊂ Ω. There is a small, universal constants δ > 0, ε3 > 0 and a large constant
M > 1 with the following properties. If

kbkLn(Su(0,4t0)) + kc−kLn(Su(0,4t0)) + kf +kLn(Su(0,4t0)) ≤ ε3

and for some nonnegative integer k

(5.43)

|{v > M k+1} ∩ Su(0, t0)| > (1 − δ)|Su(0, t0)|

then v > M k in Su(0, t0).

Proof. Let α1, δ1, ε1, M1 be as in Lemma 3.1. We choose α in Lemma 4.1 to be α1 and let ε2, M2 be the universal
constants obtained from this lemma. Let

We ﬁrst prove the proposition for k = 0. Since M2 > 1, the function ˜v = v/M2 is a W 2,n

loc (Ω) solution of

δ := δ1; M := M1M2, and ε3 = min{ε1, ε2}.

in a normalized section Su(0, 4t0) ⊂⊂ Ω where ˜f = f /M2 and

aij ˜vij + b · D˜v + c˜v ≤ ˜f

kbkLn(Su(0,4t0)) + kc−kLn(Su(0,4t0)) + k ˜f +kLn(Su(0,4t0)) ≤ ε3 ≤ ε1.

Since (5.43) holds for k = 0,

|{˜v > M1} ∩ Su(0, t0)| > (1 − δ)|Su(0, t0)| = (1 − δ1)|Su(0, t0)|,

we conclude from Lemma 3.1 that inf Su(0,α1t0) ˜v > 1, so v > M2 in Su(0, α1t0). Applying Lemma 4.1 to v, we
obtain that v > 1 in Su(0, t0). Thus, the conclusion of the proposition holds for k = 0. Now, for k ≥ 1, we apply
the result in the case k = 0 to v/M k to get the desired lower bound v > M k for v on Su(0, t0).

5.2. Rescaling the linearized Monge-Amp`ere equation. Assume that (1.5) and (1.6) are satisﬁed in Ω. In
this section, we record how the equation

(5.44)

aij vij + b · Dv + cv ≤ f

changes with respect to normalization of a section Su(x0, h) of u. By subtracting u(x0) + Du(x0) · (x − x0) + h
from u, we may assume that u |∂Su(x0,h)= 0 and u achieves its minimum −h at x0. By John’s lemma, we can ﬁnd
an aﬃne transformation T x = Ahx + bh such that

(5.45)

Let

B1(0) ⊂ T −1(Su(x0, h)) ⊂ Bn(0).

˜u(x) = (det Ah)−2/nu(T x), ˜v(x) = v(T x).

Then from (1.5), we have

(5.46)

λ ≤ det D2 ˜u ≤ Λ in T −1(Su(x0, h)),

˜u = 0 on ∂T −1(Su(x, h)) and

B1(0) ⊂ ˜S := T −1(Su(x, h)) = S˜u(y, (det Ah)−2/nh) ⊂ Bn(0)

where y is the minimum point of ˜u in T −1(Su(x0, h)).
The equation (5.44) becomes

(5.47)

˜aij ˜vij + ˜b · D˜v + ˜c˜v ≤ ˜f (x)

where the coeﬃcient matrix ˜A =(cid:0)˜aij(cid:1)1≤i,j≤n is given by

˜A = (det Ah)2/nA−1
and the lower order terms ˜b, ˜c and ˜f are given respectively by

(5.48)

h A(A−1

h )t.

(5.49)

˜b(x) = (det Ah)2/nA−1

h b(T x), ˜c(x) = (det Ah)2/nc(T x), ˜f (x) = (det Ah)2/nf (T x).

For completeness, we include the standard computation leading to (5.47). We have

D ˜u = (det Ah)−2/nAt

hDv, D2˜v = At

hD2vAh.

hDu; D2 ˜u = (det Ah)−2/nAt

hD2uAh; D˜v = At

The cofactor matrix ˜U = ( ˜U ij )1≤i,j≤n of D2 ˜u is related to U and Ah by
h (D2u)−1(A−1
(5.50)

˜U = (det D2 ˜u)(D2 ˜u)−1 = (det D2u)(det Ah)2/nA−1

h )t = (det Ah)2/nA−1

h U (A−1

h )t.

Therefore, by (5.48),

˜aij ˜vij (x) = trace( ˜AD2˜v) = (det Ah)2/ntrace(AD2v(T x)) = (det Ah)2/naijvij (T x)

and hence, recalling (5.44),

˜aij ˜vij(x) = (det Ah)2/n[f (T x) − c(T x)v(T x) − b(T x) · Dv(T x)] = ˜f (x) − ˜c˜v − ˜b · D˜v

where ˜b, ˜c, ˜f are deﬁned by (5.49). Thus, we get (5.47) as asserted.
We remark from (5.46), (5.48) and (5.50) that ˜u and ˜A also satiisfy the structural conditions (1.5) and (1.6). This
is the aﬃne invariance property of (1.7) under rescaling.
Using the volume estimates in Lemma 2.9, we ﬁnd from (5.45) that

(5.51)

[C(n, λ, Λ)]−1hn/2 ≤ det Ah ≤ C(n, λ, Λ)hn/2.

The interior C1,α∗ estimate for u in Theorem 2.13 shows that

Su(x0, h) ⊃ B(x0, c1h

Then in our rescaling process, the Ln norms of b, c, f are under control if h is bounded by a universal constant c∗

We summarize the above discussion in the following lemma.

if Su(y, h) ⊂ Bn(x0) then h ≤ c∗.

Lemma 5.2 (Critical density estimate with Lp drift). Assume that (1.5) and (1.6) are satisﬁed in Ω. Let p >
n(1+α∗)
. There is a small number ε4 depending only on p, n, λ, Λ, ˜λ and ˜Λ with the following property. Suppose

that v ≥ 0 is a W 2,n

loc (Ω) solution of

in a section Su(x0, h) ⊂⊂ Ω with h ≤ 4c∗ and
(5.57)

kbkLp(Su(x0,h)) + kc−kLn(Su(x0,h)) + kf +kLn(Su(x0,h)) ≤ ε4.

Let M and δ be as in Proposition 5.1. If for some nonnegative integer k, we have

(5.58)

|{v > M k+1} ∩ Su(x0, h/4)| > (1 − δ)|Su(x0, h/4)|

then v > M k in Su(x0, h/4).

Proof of Lemma 5.2. Rescaling the equation as above, we obtain (5.47) on a normalized section of ˜u, ˜S =
T −1(Su(x, h)) ≡ S˜u(y, 4t0). If ε4 is small, depending only on p, n, λ, Λ, ˜λ and ˜Λ , then from (5.57) and (5.54)-
(5.56), we ﬁnd

k˜bkLn( ˜S) + k˜c−kLn( ˜S) + k ˜f +kLn( ˜S) ≤ ε3.

Note that

T −1({v > M k+1} ∩ Su(x0, h/4)) = {˜v > M K+1} ∩ S˜u(y, t0); T −1(Su(x0, h/4)) = S˜u(y, t0).

Thus, the assumption (5.58) implies

|S˜u(y, t0) ∩ {˜v > M k+1}| > (1 − δ)|S˜u(y, t0)|.

Proposition 5.1 applied to (5.47) gives ˜v > M k on S˜u(y, t0). Rescaling back, we have v > M k in Su(x0, h/4). (cid:3)

Suppose that

v ≤ 1.

Then there are universal constants C1(n, λ, Λ, ˜λ, ˜Λ) > 1 and ε(n, λ, Λ, ˜λ, ˜Λ) ∈ (0, 1) such that

|{v > t} ∩ Su(0, t0)| ≤ C1t−ǫ|Su(0, t0)| for all t > 0.

Proof of Theorem 5.3. Let δ ∈ (0, 1) and M > 1 be the constants in Proposition 5.1. The conclusion of the theorem
follows from the following decay estimate for Ak := {v > M k} ∩ Su(0, t0):

|Ak| ≤ C2M−ǫk|Su(0, t0)|.

Note that Ak’s are open sets and Ak ⊂ A1 for all k ≥ 1. Recalling inf Su(0,t0) v ≤ 1, by Lemma 5.2, we have

|Ak| ≤ |A1| ≤ (1 − δ)|Su(0, t0)| for all k.

Claim. If a section Su(y, t) ⊂ Su(0, t0) satisﬁes

(5.60)

|Su(y, t) ∩ Ak+1| > (1 − δ)|Su(y, t)|,

then Su(y, t) ⊂ Ak.

Indeed, from Su(y, t) ⊂ Su(0, t0) and Lemma 2.14, we have

(5.61)

Then (5.59) gives

Su(y, 4t) ⊂ Su(0, ˆKt0) ⊂⊂ Ω.

kbkLp(Su(y,4t)) + kc−kLn(Su(y,4t)) + kf +kLn(Su(y,4t)) ≤ ε4.

Thus, all the hypotheses of Lemma 5.2 are satisﬁed on Su(y, 4t). Applying this lemma, we conclude from (5.60)
that v > M k on Su(y, t). This proves the Claim.
Using the Claim and Lemma 2.16, we obtain

and therefore, by induction,

|Ak+1| ≤ (1 − cδ)|Ak|,

|Ak| ≤ (1 − c2δ)k−1(1 − δ)|Su(0, t0)| = C2M−ǫk|Su(0, t0)|,

where ε = − log(1 − c2δ)/ log M and C2 = (1 − c2δ)−1(1 − δ). This ﬁnishes the proof.

(cid:3)

Remark 5.4. We need a universal constant ˆK in the above lemma to guarantee the validity of (5.61). If u(x) =
2 |x|2 then Su(y, t) = B√2t(y) and (5.61) holds when ˆK = 4. Under (1.5) only, sections of u can have degenerate

geometry, namely, they can be long and thin in diﬀerent direction.

6. Harnack inequality

In this section, we prove Theorem 1.1. It follows from the following theorem and a covering argument.

Theorem 6.1 (Harnack inequality for section with small height). Assume that (1.5) and (1.6) are satisﬁed in Ω.
Suppose that v ≥ 0 is a W 2,n
loc (Ω) solution of (1.7) in a section S := Su(x0, h) ⊂⊂ Ω where f ∈ Ln(S), c ∈ Ln(S)

Given Theorem 6.1, we can prove our main result as stated in Theorem 1.1.

Proof of Theorem 1.1. Let ε5(n, p, λ, Λ, ˜λ, ˜Λ) and h0 be as in Theorem 6.1. By Theorem 2.12, there is a small,
universal constant τ (n, λ, Λ) ∈ (0, 1/8) such that if x ∈ Su(x0, h) := D then

Su(x, 8τ h) ⊂ Su(x0, 2h).

We ﬁrst consider the case h ≥ h0. By Lemma 2.15 (ii), we can select from D ⊂Sx∈D Su(x, τ h0) a ﬁnite covering

as asserted. The proof of Theorem 1.1 is complete.

(cid:3)

The rest of the section is devoted to the proof of Theorem 6.1.

Proof of Theorem 6.1. Let δ ∈ (0, 1) and M > 1 be the constants in Proposition 5.1 and ε ∈ (0, 1) be the constant
in Theorem 5.3. Let ε4 and c∗ be as in Lemma 5.2. We choose ε5 so that

Cε5 ≤

ε4

16M

where C is the universal constant appearing in (5.53)- (5.56). We rescale our equation, the domain, and functions as
in Section 5.2. Since h ≤ h0, by (5.53) and (5.55), the functions ˜b, ˜c satisfy on the normalized ˜S = T −1(Su(x0, h)) =
S˜u(y, 4t0) the bound

(6.65)

We need to show that

˜v ≤ C(n, λ, Λ, ˜λ, ˜Λ)(cid:18) inf

S ˜u(y,t0/2)

˜v + k ˜fkLn( ˜S)(cid:19) .

Without loss of generality, we can assume that t0 = 1 and y = 0. We now drop the tildes in our argument. By
changing coordinates and subtracting an aﬃne function from u, we can assume that u ≥ 0, u(0) = 0, Du(0) = 0.
For simplicity, we denote St = Su(0, t). The theorem follows from the following Claim.
Claim. If inf Su(0,1/2) v ≤ 1 and kf kLn(S) ≤ ε4

16M then for some universal constant C, we have supSu(0,1/2) v ≤ C.

Indeed, for each τ > 0, the function

satisﬁes aijvτ

ij + b · Dvτ + cvτ = f τ where

vτ =

inf Su(0,1/2) v + τ + 16M kf kLn(S)/ε4

Thus,

v + τ + 16M kf kLn(S)/ε4(cid:19) .

Sending τ → 0, we get the conclusion of the theorem.

HARNACK INEQUALITY VIA SLIDING PARABOLOIDS

25

We now prove the Claim, following the line of argument in Imbert-Silvestre [9] in the case u(x) = 1

2 |x|2. Let
β > 0 be a universal constant to be determined later and let ht(x) = t(1 − u(x))−β be deﬁned in Su(0, 1). We
consider the minimum value of t such that ht ≥ v in Su(0, 1). It suﬃces to show that t is bounded by a universal
constant C, because we have then

sup

v ≤ C sup

(1 − u)−β ≤ 2βC.

Su(0,1/2)

Su(0,1/2)

If t ≤ 1, we are done. Hence, we further assume that t ≥ 1.

Since t is chosen to be the minimum value such that ht ≥ v, then there must exist some x0 ∈ Su(0, 1) such
that ht(x0) = v(x0). Let r = (1 − u(x0))/2. Let H0 := ht(x0) = t(2r)−β ≥ 1. By Theorem 2.12, there is a small
constant ˆc and large constant

such that

(6.67)

p1 = (n + 1)µ−1

Su(x0, ˆKˆcrp1 ) ⊂ Su(0, 1),

where ˆK is the constant in Lemma 2.14.

We bound t by estimating the measure of the set {v ≥ H0/2} ∩ Su(x0, ˆcrp1 ) from above and below. The estimate
from above can be done using Theorem 5.3. First, recalling S = ˜S = Su(0, 4), we ﬁnd from (6.65), kf kLn(S) ≤ ε4
16M
and (6.67) that

kbkLp(Su(x0, ˆK ˆcrp1 )) + kckLn(Su(x0, ˆK ˆcrp1 )) + kf kLn(Su(x0, ˆKˆcrp1 )) ≤ ε4.

Then, Theorem 5.3 tells us that

(6.68)

|{v > H0/2} ∩ Su(x0, ˆcrp1 )| ≤ CH−ǫ

0 |Su(x0, ˆcrp1 )| ≤ CH−ǫ

0 |Su(0, 1)| ≤ Ct−ǫ(2r)βǫ.

To estimate the measure of {v ≥ H0/2} ∩ Su(x0, ˆcrp1 ) from below, we apply Lemma 5.2 to C1 − C2v on a small
but deﬁnite fraction of this section. Let ρ be the small universal constant and β be a large universal constant such
that

(6.69)

M(cid:0)1 − ρ)−β − 1(cid:1) =

, β ≥

n(n + 1)

2µε

.

Consider the section Su(x0, c1rp1 ) where c1 ≤ c∗. We claim that 1 − u(x) ≥ 2r − 2ρr in this section if c1 is
universally small. Indeed, if x ∈ Su(x0, c1rp1 ) then by Theorem 2.11, we have |x − x0| ≤ C(c1rp1 )µ ≤ cµ/2
1 ρr for
small, universal c1. Hence, by the gradient estimate in Lemma 2.6

1 − u(x) = 2r + u(x0) − u(x) ≥ 2r − ( sup

Su(0,1)

|∇u|)|x − x0| ≥ 2r − C(n, λ, Λ)cµ/2

1 ρr ≥ 2r − 2ρr.

The maximum of v in the section Su(x0, c1rp1 ) is at most the maximum of ht which is not greater than t(2r −
2ρr)−β = (1 − ρ)−βH0. Deﬁne the following functions for x ∈ Su(x0, c1rp1 )

w(x) =

(1 − ρ)−βH0 − v(x)
((1 − ρ)−β − 1) H0

, and ¯f =

c(1 − ρ)−βH0 − f
((1 − ρ)−β − 1) H0

.

Note that w(x0) = 1, and w is a non-negative solution of

(6.70)

aij wij + b · Dw + cw = ¯f in Su(x0, c1rp1 ).

Observe that, by (6.69), (6.65) and the assumption on f in our Claim,

k ¯fkLn(S) ≤

c(1 − ρ)−β

((1 − ρ)−β − 1)

kckLn(S) +

1

((1 − ρ)−β − 1)

kf kLn(S)

= (2M + 1)kckLn(S) + 2M kf kLn(S) ≤ ε4/2.

Therefore,

(6.71)

kbkLp(Su(x0,c1rp1 )) + kckLn(Su(x0,c1rp1 )) + k ¯fkLn(Su(x0,c1rp1 )) ≤ ε4.

NAM Q. LE

From (6.70) and (6.71), we can use Lemma 5.2 to obtain

(6.72)

|{w ≤ M } ∩ Su(x0, 1/4c1rp1 )| ≥ δ|Su(x0, 1/4c1rp1 )|.

In terms of the original function v, this is an estimate of a subset of Su(x0, 1/4c1rp1 ) where where v is larger than

because of the choice of ρ and β in (6.69). Thus, we obtain from (6.72) the estimate

|{v ≥ H0/2} ∩ Su(x0, c1rp1 )| ≥ δ|Su(x0, c1rp1 )|.

for some universally small c3. By the choice of β in (6.69), we ﬁnd that t is universally bounded. The proof of
