Abstract

We describe small dominating sets of the incidence graphs of ﬁnite projec-
tive planes by establishing a stability result which shows that dominating sets are
strongly related to blocking and covering sets. Our main result states that if a dom-

inating set in a projective plane of order q > 81 is smaller than 2q + 2⌊√q⌋ + 2 (i.e.,

twice the size of a Baer subplane), then it contains either all but possibly one points
of a line or all but possibly one lines through a point. Furthermore, we completely
characterize dominating sets of size at most 2q +√q + 1. In Desarguesian planes, we
could rely on strong stability results on blocking sets to show that if a dominating
set is suﬃciently smaller than 3q, then it consists of the union of a blocking set and
a covering set apart from a few points and lines.

Introduction

Since the pioneering work of Berge, Cockayne, Hedetniemi, Ore, Vizing and others con-
cerning domination in graphs (see for instance [17]), the study of domination-related
functions became a wide branch in graph theory. Given a graph G = (V, E), a subset
D ⊆ V is a dominating set of G if its closed neighborhood ∪v∈DN[v] = V . The domination
number is the number of vertices in a smallest dominating set of G.

Let Πq be an arbitrary ﬁnite projective plane of order q. The purpose of this paper is
to characterize small dominating sets of the incidence graph of Πq. Generally, we do

1

not assume that the plane is built on a ﬁnite ﬁeld Fq; if we do, we denote the plane by
PG(2, q). For an introduction to ﬁnite projective and aﬃne planes, see [2].

We consider ﬁnite planes as incidence structures and hence, unless causing confusion,
we identify them with their incidence graphs and mix the graph theoretic and geometric
terminology. Thus we refer to the vertices of this incidence graph as points and lines of
the projective plane. Throughout the paper, D = PD ∪ LD denotes a dominating set in
(the incidence graph of) a ﬁnite projective plane Πq where PD is a subset of the points
and LD is a subset of the lines. For a point P , [P ] denotes the set of lines incident with
P . Dually, if we want to emphasize the diﬀerence between a line ℓ and the set of points
incident with ℓ, we might write [ℓ] to indicate the latter.

The idea to systematically study dominating sets of (incidence graphs of) combinatorial
designs appeared in the work of Goldberg et al. [16]. Among others, they proved the
accurate lower bound on the size of minimal dominating sets of projective planes of order
q and formulated a conjecture on the structure of dominating sets that attain this bound.
Our Theorem 1.5 veriﬁes this conjecture and goes far beyond by establishing a stability
result.

Theorem 1.1. [16] The domination number of the incidence graph of an arbitrary pro-
jective plane of order q is 2q.

In case of ﬁnite projective planes, the similar concept of blocking sets has been widely
investigated since the late 60’s.

Deﬁnition 1.2. A set of points is a blocking set in Πq if every line of Πq intersects the
set in at least one point. A set of lines is a covering set in Πq if every point of Πq lies on
at least one line of the set.

It is clear that blocking sets and covering sets are dual concepts. The smallest examples
of blocking sets in Πq are lines; they have q + 1 points. Blocking sets containing a full line
are called trivial. The trivial examples for covering sets are full pencils, i.e., the set of
q +1 lines incident with an arbitrary point. Other important examples of blocking sets are
Baer subplanes, which exist only if q is a square, and they have q + √q + 1 points. Note
that we can similarly deﬁne blocking sets for aﬃne planes. We provide more information
on projective and aﬃne blocking sets in Section 2.

The union of a blocking set and a covering set of Πq clearly provides an example for a
dominating set in Πq. In fact, to dominate a line ℓ, a dominating set D must contain
either one of the points of ℓ or ℓ itself, which means that PD dominates (blocks) all lines
not in LD, and LD dominates (covers) all points not in PD. Hence, in some sense, a small
dominating set has to be close to the union of a blocking set and a covering set. Our main
Theorems 1.5 and 1.7 can be considered as formal versions of this statement.

A dominating (blocking) set is minimal if it does not contain a smaller dominating (block-
ing) set. Since dominating sets are closed under addition of further vertices, we only
consider minimal ones. A minimal dominating set D might contain more than one point
whose removal from D provides a set which dominates every line and point except the

2

removed point itself. Thus although D was minimal, removing two points from it and
adding the line incident with both points would result in a smaller dominating set. This
phenomenon motivates the following concept.
Deﬁnition 1.3. We call a dominating set D = PD ∪LD of Πq stable, if it is minimal and
there is no dominating set D′ ⊃ D such that |D′| = |D| + 1 and D′ contains a dominating
set of size less than |D|.
From every minimal dominating set one may get a stable one after some steps of exchang-
ing some incident points and lines and some deletion. Essentially we claim that small
stable dominating sets are the union of a blocking set and a covering set after the deletion
or addition of at most two vertices.

It is convenient to deﬁne a class of dominating sets in projective planes that contain or
almost contain a trivial blocking or covering set.

Deﬁnition 1.4. We call a dominating set a primal dominating set if it contains q con-
current lines or q collinear points (possibly a full pencil or a full line).
Theorem 1.5. Let D be a minimal dominating set in the incidence graph of an arbitrary
projective plane Πq, q ≥ 5. If |D| ≤ 2q + √q + 1, then D is stable. Furthermore, one of
the following holds:

• D is primal, and

(i) |D| = 2q, and D is the union of q collinear points on a line ℓ and q concurrent

lines through a point P such that P ∈ ℓ, P, ℓ /∈ D,

(ii) |D| = 2q + 2, and D is the union of all q + 1 points of a line ℓ and q + 1
concurrent lines through a point P such that P 6∈ ℓ,
(iii) |D| = 2q + √q + 1, and either (a) there is a Baer subplane Π′ and a point
P ∈ Π′ such that LD = [P ] and PD = Π′ \ {P}, or (b) D is the dual of the
structure described in (a),
(iv) 3q−1 > |D| > 2q +√q + 1; moreover, if D is stable, then (a) LD is a full pencil
and PD consists of all but possibly one point of a nontrivial minimal blocking
set of Πq, or (b) LD is a full pencil plus a line ℓ and PD consists of all but
possibly one points of a minimal aﬃne blocking set of Πq \ ℓ, or (c) D is the
dual of the structure described in (a) or (b),

(v) |D| ≥ 3q − 1.

• D is not primal, and
(vi) |D| ≥ 2q + 2(cid:4)√q(cid:5) + 2, provided that q > 81.

Remark 1.6. Note that some lower bound on q is essential. For example, if one considers
the point set of an oval (if q is odd) or hyperoval (if q is even) and the skew lines to this
point set, the obtained structure is clearly a non-primal dominating set of size q + 1 +

q(q − 1)/2 or q + 2 + q(q − 1)/2, which can be smaller than 2(q +√q + 1) for small values
of q. Also, if P, Q ∈ ℓ, then ([ℓ] \ {P, Q}) ∪ (([P ] ∪ [Q]) \ {ℓ}) is a non-stable dominating
set of size 3q − 1, which is not greater than 2q + √q + 1 if q ≤ 4.

3

It is easy to see that the structures described in Theorem 1.5 (i)-(iv) are dominating sets.
They are very close to the union of a blocking set and a covering set at least one of which
is trivial. Indeed, let B be a blocking set of Πq, and let P be an arbitrary point. Then
D = (B \{P})∪ [P ] is clearly a dominating set of size |B| + q or |B| + q + 1, depending on
whether P ∈ B or P /∈ B, respectively. However, D may not be a minimal dominating set
even if B is a minimal blocking set; for example, if a line ℓ through P contains q points
of B, then ℓ is not essential for D, so we may exclude it from D. Regarding Theorem 1.5:
when B is a line, we get (i) if P ∈ B and (ii) if P /∈ B; if B is a Baer subplane, we get (iii)
if P ∈ B, and we get a dominating set of size 2q + √q + 2 if P /∈ B. Note that if we let B
be a blocking set of the aﬃne plane Πq \ ℓ for some line ℓ of Πq and P /∈ ℓ is an arbitrary
point, then D = (B \ {P}) ∪ ([P ] ∪ {ℓ}) is also a dominating set.
Theorem 1.5 (vi) is sharp when q is a square: the union of a Baer subplane and a dual
Baer subplane meets the bound. We conjecture that this is the only case when Theorem
1.5 (vi) is sharp; for more details, see Section 4.

In PG(2, q), due to its algebraic manner, strong stability results on blocking sets could
have been obtained, which equip us to prove much stronger correspondences between
dominating, blocking and covering sets than for general projective planes.

Theorem 1.7. Let D be a (not necessarily stable) non-primal dominating set in PG(2, q),
q = ph, p prime.

• If |D| ≤ 5
• If |D| ≤ 8

and LD is a covering set.

2, then PD is a blocking set and LD is a covering set.

2q − 3
3q − 2, then either |PD| ≤ |LD| and PD is a blocking set, or |LD| ≤ |PD|

3q − 2.

• If h = 1, then |D| > 8
• If |D| ≤ 3q − 6√q + 3, h ≥ 2 and p ≥ 200, then either |PD| ≤ |LD| and PD can be
extended to a blocking set by adding at most three points to it, or |LD| ≤ |PD| and
LD can be extended to a covering set by adding at most three lines to it.
• If |D| ≤ 3q − 6√q + 3 and h = 1, then either |PD| ≤ |LD| and PD contains q − 3
collinear points, or |LD| ≤ |PD| and LD contains q − 3 concurrent lines. (That is,
the smaller of PD and LD can be extended to a trivial blocking or covering set by
adding at most four points or lines.)

The paper is built up as follows.
In Section 2, we brieﬂy introduce the results and
terminology regarding blocking sets we need in the sequel; then we proceed by proving
our main Theorem 1.5 in three steps. First we describe stable primal dominating sets and
verify parts (i) to (v) in Subsection 2.2. Then we show that a small minimal non-primal
dominating set D cannot have long secants. Next we prove that if D has only short
secants, then the desired bound |D| ≥ 2q + 2(cid:4)√q(cid:5) + 2 holds, conﬁrming the missing part
of the main theorem. Let us note that it is quite technical to handle the case when q is
not a square. In Section 3, we treat the Desarguesian case and prove Theorem 1.7. We
end with some open problems and general remarks on the topic in Section 4.

2 Proof of the main theorem

Throughout this section, D = PD ∪ LD is a dominating set in an arbitrary projective
plane Πq.

2.1 Results on blocking sets

It is easy to see that the set of all points of an arbitrary line of Πq is a blocking set of size
q + 1 (these example are called trivial blocking sets). Let us give a quick result.

Proposition 2.1 (folklore). A set of k points blocks at most kq + 1 lines. Equality holds
if and only if the k points are collinear.

Proof. Let {P1, . . . , Pk} be a set of k points. P1 blocks exactly q + 1 lines. For i ≥ 2,
as PjPi is already blocked by Pj (1 ≤ j ≤ i − 1), Pi blocks at most q new lines with
equality if and only if P1, . . . , Pi are collinear. Hence the total number of lines blocked is
q + 1 + (k − 1)q. The case of equality follows immediately.
The above easy calculation shows that any blocking set must contain at least q + 1 points
and in case of equality, it is the point set of a line. A blocking set is nontrivial if it does
not contain a full line. A point of a blocking set B is called essential (for B) if B \ {P} is
not a blocking set, and a blocking set is minimal if and only if all its points are essential.
A Baer subplane in Πq is a subplane of order √q + 1 (so q must be a square). It is well-
known that a Baer subplane Π′ has q +√q + 1 points and every line intersects Π′ in either
one point (i.e., the line is a tangent line) or √q+1 points (i.e., the line is a (√q+1)-secant),
every point of Π′ is incident with exactly √q + 1 (√q + 1)-secants, and every point not
in Π′ is incident with exactly one (√q + 1)-secant. Hence a Baer subplane is a blocking
set, and the set of (√q + 1)-secants of a Baer subplane (that is, a dual Baer subplane)
is a covering set, both of size q + √q + 1. Baer subplanes always exist in Desarguesian
projective planes of square order. Bruen gave a combinatorial characterization of the
smallest nontrivial blocking sets.

Result 2.2. [10] A nontrivial blocking set in an arbitrary projective plane Πq of order q
has at least q + √q + 1 points. Moreover, if this lower bound is met, then the blocking set
consists of the points of a Baer subplane of Πq.

For general aﬃne planes, the best but probably not sharp lower bound known is similar.

Result 2.3. [3, 11] If B is a blocking set in an arbitrary aﬃne plane Aq of order q, then
|B| ≥ q + √q + 1.

Since Bruen’s paper, many results have been obtained which describe the possible size
and structure of blocking sets, mostly in Desarguesian projective planes. See [5] for more
details.

2.2 Primal dominating sets

First we treat primal dominating sets that contain q concurrent lines. Due to duality, it
is enough to handle this case.

Lemma 2.4. Let D = PD ∪ LD be a minimal dominating set in an arbitrary projective
plane Πq of size less than 3q − 1. Suppose that there is a point P such that |[P ]∩LD| = q.
Let ℓ be the unique line in [P ]\LD. Then LD = [P ]\ ℓ and PD = [ℓ]\{P}; hence |D| = 2q
and D is stable.
Proof. We have two cases: either every point of ℓ except possibly P belongs to PD or there
exists Q ∈ ℓ, Q 6= P such that Q /∈ PD. In the former case, ([ℓ] \ {P}) ∪ ([P ] \ {ℓ}) ⊆ D
is a dominating set of size 2q and, by minimality, this is D. It is easy to see that this
construction is stable. In the latter case, we consider three disjoint groups of elements of
D. There are q lines of LD through P ; the q lines on Q diﬀerent from ℓ must either be in
LD or contain a point from PD, which requires q more elements of D; furthermore, each
one of the q− 1 points of ℓ\{P, Q} is also dominated by D so it is either in PD or on a line
of LD, which requires q − 1 more elements of D. Thus |D| ≥ 3q − 1, a contradiction.
Lemma 2.5. Let D = PD ∪LD be a stable dominating set in an arbitrary projective plane
Πq of size less than 3q − 1. Suppose that there is a point P such that |[P ] ∩ LD| = q + 1.
Then we have the following possibilities.

1. LD = [P ], P /∈ PD and PD ∪ {P} is a blocking set in Πq for which the only non-

essential point may be P ;

2. ∃!ℓ /∈ [P ] : LD = [P ] ∪ ℓ, P /∈ PD and PD ∪ {P} is a blocking set in the aﬃne plane

Πq \ ℓ for which the only non-essential point may be P .

Proof. As [P ] ⊆ LD, every point is dominated by [P ] and, clearly, P /∈ PD as D is
minimal. If there were at least two lines in LD \ [P ], adding their intersection point to D
provided a dominating set with at least two surplus lines, in contradiction with D being
stable.
If there is exactly one line ℓ in LD \ [P ], then PD ∩ ℓ = ∅ (otherwise D \ {ℓ} was also a
dominating set), hence PD ∪ {P} is a blocking set in the aﬃne plane Πq \ ℓ. If LD \ [P ] is
empty, then PD must block every line except possibly those of LD, thus PD ∪ {P} forms
a blocking set of Πq. Since D is minimal, any point Q ∈ PD is incident with a line not in
LD that is tangent to PD. As [P ] ⊂ LD, these lines are tangents to PD ∪ {P}, so every
point of PD is essential for the respective (aﬃne or projective) blocking set.
Lemmas 2.4 and 2.5 (and their duals) allow us to use Results 2.2 and 2.3 on projective
and aﬃne blocking sets in order to prove the assertions of Theorem 1.5 (i)-(v).

Proof of Theorem 1.5, primal case. Let D be a minimal primal dominating set. If |D| ≥
3q − 1, we have Theorem 1.5 (v). If |D| < 3q − 1, then by primality and duality we may
assume that there is a point P such that |[P ] ∩ LD| ≥ q.

6

Suppose ﬁrst that D is stable. Then, according to Lemmas 2.4 and 2.5, P /∈ PD and we
have the following possibilities:

• |D| = 2q, and D is exactly the dominating set described in Theorem 1.5 (i).
• LD = [P ] and B = PD ∪ {P} is a projective blocking set.
If B is minimal, then it is a line, a Baer subplane, or |B| > q + √q + 1 (Result
2.2). If B is a line, then PD consists of precisely q collinear points; hence the dual
of Lemma 2.4 gives that |LD| = q, a contradiction with LD = [P ]. If B is a Baer
subplane, then |PD| = q +√q and |LD| = q + 1 give |D| = 2q +√q + 1 (Theorem 1.5
(iii)). If B is neither a line nor a Baer subplane, then |D| > 2q + √q + 1 (Theorem
1.5 (iv)).
If B is not minimal, then PD = B \ {P} is a minimal blocking set, hence either PD
is a line or |PD| ≥ q + √q + 1. If PD is a line, then |D| = 2(q + 1) (Theorem 1.5
(ii)). If PD is a Baer subplane, then |D| > 2q + √q + 1 (Theorem 1.5 (iv)).
• ∃!ℓ /∈ [P ] : LD = [P ]∪ℓ, PD∪{P} is an aﬃne blocking set in Πq\ℓ. Then |LD| = q+2
and |PD| ≥ q + √q (Result 2.3), hence |D| > 2q + √q + 1 (Theorem 1.5 (iv)).

D ∪ L′
D

Suppose now that D is a smallest minimal non-stable primal dominating set, and suppose
to the contrary that |D| ≤ 2q + √q + 1. (Note that if q > 4, then |D| < 3q − 1 follows.)
|[P ] ∩ LD| = q is not possible, otherwise D would be stable by Lemma 2.4. By the
properties of D, we can obtain a stable dominating set D′ = P′
by adding a vertex
v to D and removing the appearing surplus vertices (at least two) from it. We claim that
D′ is primal. Suppose to the contrary. If |[P ] ∩ L′
D| ≥ q, we are ready; otherwise there
are two lines, e1 and e2 in [P ] \ L′
. As D′ is not primal, both lines contain at least one
D
point not in P′
D ∪ {P} and, as |P′
D| ≤ |PD| + 1, we ﬁnd a point R /∈ (PD ∪ P′
) on, say,
D
e1. Then the q lines of [R] \ {e1}, the points of [e1] \ {P, R} are dominated by distinct
vertices of D′, at most one of which may not be in D; hence, as [P ] ⊂ LD, we see that
|D| ≥ q + q − 1 − 1 + q + 1 = 3q − 1, a contradiction. So D′ is indeed primal, stable, and
|D′| ≤ 2q + √q.
According to the above veriﬁed possibilities, D′ is one of the structures given in Theorem
1.5 (i) and (ii), both of which are symmetric in the roles of points and lines. Hence,
without loss of generality, we may assume that v = Q is a point. Considering the two
D ⊂ [e] for a line e, Q ∈ e, and either |D′| = 2q and all lines of
possibilities, we see that P′
[Q]\{e} are tangents to P′
, or D′ = [e]∪ [P ] for some P /∈ e and all lines of [Q]\{e, P Q}
D
are tangents to P′
. In both cases, these lines must be dominated by pairwise distinct
D
vertices of D \D′, so we get |D| ≥ 2q − 1 + q = 3q − 1 and |D| ≥ 2(q + 1)− 1 + q − 1 = 3q,
respectively, in contradiction with |D| ≤ 2q + √q + 1 (under q > 4).

2.3 Non-primal case: short secants, improved bounds on |D|

Having described primal stable dominating sets, we always suppose in the sequel that
every line of Πq intersects PD in at most q − 1 points and dually, every point of Πq is on

7

at most q − 1 lines of LD. We will see that in this case, PD cannot have long secants,
nor can LD densely cover any point. To prove this, we need some simple results that
establish connections between the maximal number of points covered by a set of lines and
its maximum coverage number.

Lemma 2.6 (folklore). Suppose that L is a set of lines in Πq such that the maximum
number of concurrent lines in L is exactly c. Then the number of points covered by L is
at most

c2 − (|L| + 1)c + |L|(q + 1) + 1.

Proof. Let n = |L| and L = {ℓ1, . . . , ℓn} so that ℓ1, . . . , ℓc are concurrent. Then for every
c + 1 ≤ i ≤ n, ℓi covers at most q + 1 − c points that are not covered by ℓ1, . . . , ℓc. Thus
the total number of covered points is at most 1 + cq + (n− c)(q + 1 − c) = c2 − (n + 1)c +
n(q + 1) + 1.

Deﬁnition 2.7. Let c = c(LD) be the maximal number such that there exists a point P
with |[P ] ∩ LD| = c; dually, k = k(PD) is the maximal number such that there exists a
line ℓ with |ℓ ∩ PD| = k.
Lemma 2.8. Suppose that |LD| + 2 − q ≤ c ≤ q − 1. Then |LD| ≥ 4q − 2 − |D|.
Proof. As D is a dominating set, LD covers every point not in PD. Compared with the
bound of Lemma 2.6, we obtain

c2 − (|LD| + 1)c + |LD|(q + 1) + 1 ≥ q2 + q + 1 − |PD|.

By the assumption on c, the maximum of the left-hand side in c is achieved for c = q − 1
(and c = |LD| + 2 − q), thus

2|LD| + |PD| ≥ 4q − 2.

Substituting |PD| + |LD| = |D|, we obtain the stated formula.
We will also need an easy bound.

Proposition 2.9. |D| ≥ q2 + q− (q− 1)|PD| and |D| ≥ q2 + q− (q− 1)|LD|. In particular,
if |D| < 3q − 1, then |PD| ≥ q and |LD| ≥ q.
Proof. As every line not blocked by PD must be in LD, Proposition 2.1 gives |D| =
|PD| + |LD| ≥ |PD| + q2 + q + 1 − (|PD|q + 1) = q2 + q − (q − 1)|PD|. If |D| < 3q − 1, this
immediately gives |PD| ≥ q. By duality, we are done.
Note that Proposition 2.9 relies on Proposition 2.1 only and it immediately gives |D| ≥ 2q
(Theorem 1.1); moreover, the characterization of equality also follows from Proposition
2.1.

Now we are ready to prove that if a stable dominating set is small but not primal, then
c and k are small. More precisely,

8

Proposition 2.10. Assume that D is not primal. Suppose that |D| +|PD| ≤ 4q−3. Then
k ≤ |PD| − q + 1. If |D| + |LD| ≤ 4q − 3, then c ≤ |LD| − q + 1. Both assertions hold if
|D| ≤ (5q − 3)/2.
Proof. By duality, it is enough to treat the assertions regarding c. If |D| ≤ (5q − 3)/2,
then Proposition 2.9 gives |PD| ≥ q, so |LD| ≤ |D| − q, whence |D| + |LD| ≤ 4q − 3
follows. As D is not primal, c ≤ q − 1 holds. By |D| + |LD| ≤ 4q − 3, Proposition 2.8
gives c ≤ |LD| − q + 1.
By Proposition 2.10, we see that if PD is not too large, then it has no long secants. On
the other hand, PD must block almost all lines (the lines of LD may not be blocked). In
such a situation the standard equations have already proved useful [6, 10], so we use them
in the next proposition, a major step in the proof. Note that by duality, |PD| ≤ |LD| may
be assumed.

Proposition 2.11. If D is a non-primal dominating set in Πq, q > 81, of size |D| ≤
2(q + √q + 1), then |PD| > q + 2√q + 1 − k holds or |PD| ≥ q +(cid:4)√q(cid:5) + 1.

The proof of this proposition is quite laborous, so we devote a standalone subsection to
it. Note that if Proposition 2.11 holds, then we are ready to conﬁrm Theorem 1.5:

Proof of Theorem 1.5, second part. Suppose that D is non-primal, |D| ≤ 2(q + √q + 1),
and q > 81. By duality, assume that |PD| ≤ |LD|. Proposition 2.11 yields either |PD| >
q + 2√q + 1 − k or |PD| ≥ q + (cid:4)√q(cid:5) + 1. In the former case, together with Proposition
2.10 we get 2|PD| > q + 2√q + 1− k + (q + k − 1), which also implies |PD| ≥ q +(cid:4)√q(cid:5) + 1.
Thus |D| ≥ 2|PD| ≥ 2(q +(cid:4)√q(cid:5) + 1).

2.4 Proof of Proposition 2.11

Throughout this section we suppose that |D| ≤ 2(q + √q + 1), |PD| ≤ q + 2√q + 1 − k,
and we are about to show that |PD| ≥ q + (cid:4)√q(cid:5) + 1. Note that k ≥ (cid:4)√q(cid:5) + 2 implies
immediately that |PD| ≥ q +(cid:4)√q(cid:5)+1 (Proposition 2.10), so we also assume k ≤ (cid:4)√q(cid:5)+1.
Note that if k = 2, then |PD| ≤ q + 2 and, as all skew lines to PD are in LD, we have
|LD| ≥ q2 + q + 1 − |PD|(q + 1) +(cid:0)|PD|2 (cid:1) ≥ (cid:0)q
2.4.1 The case k ≤ √q

2(cid:1) > |D| if q ≥ 8. Thus we assume k ≥ 3.

Take an arbitrary ordering of the lines of Πq and let mi be the number of the points of
PD on the ith line. Observing that mi = 0 implies that the corresponding line is in LD,
s := |{i : mi = 0}| ≤ |LD| follows. Then counting in two diﬀerent ways the number of
pairs (P, ℓ) with P ∈ PD ∩ ℓ, and triples (P, Q, ℓ) with P, Q ∈ PD ∩ ℓ, we obtain what are
referred to as the standard equations:

mi = |PD|(q + 1),

Xi=1

mi(mi − 1) = |PD|(|PD| − 1).

Consider the sum

w(PD) := Xi:mi>0

(mi − 1)(mi − k)

(2.1)

As mi ≤ k for all 1 ≤ i ≤ q2 + q + 1, we have that w(PD) ≤ 0. On the other hand, using
the standard equations we obtain

w(PD) = Xi:mi>0

mi(mi − 1) − k Xi:mi>0

mi + Xi:mi>0

k

= |PD|2 − (k(q + 1) + 1)|PD| + k(q2 + q + 1 − s).

Then s ≤ |LD| and |PD| + |LD| = |D| imply

w(PD) ≥ |PD|2 − (kq + 1)|PD| + k(q2 + q + 1 − |D|).

(2.2)

Using |D| ≤ 2(q + √q + 1), |PD| ≤ q + 2√q + 1 − k and q + 2√q + 1 − k ≤ (kq + 1)/2
(which holds if k ≥ 3), the right hand side of inequality (2.2) can be estimated as
0 ≥ w(PD) ≥ |PD|2 − (kq + 1)|PD| + k(q2 + q + 1 − |D|)
≥ (q + 2√q + 1 − k)2 − (kq + 1)(q + 2√q + 1 − k) + k(q2 + q + 1 − 2(q + √q + 1))
= (q + 1)(√q − k)2 + 4(q + √q)(√q − k) + 2(√q − k).

(2.3)

This is in turn a contradiction if √q− k > 0. Note that k = √q is only possible if we have
equality in (2.3), hence |PD| = q + 2√q + 1 − k = q + √q + 1, which ﬁts our assertion.
Thus the only case we still have to consider is k = (cid:4)√q(cid:5) + 1.
2.4.2 Non-existence of D with k = (cid:4)√q(cid:5) + 1 and |PD| ≤ q +(cid:4)√q(cid:5) − 1, q ≥ 27
Substituting k = (cid:4)√q(cid:5) + 1 and |PD| ≤ q +(cid:4)√q(cid:5) − 1 ≤ q + 2√q − k into (2.2), we get an

improved version of (2.3):

0 ≥ w(PD) ≥ |PD|2 − (kq + 1)|PD| + k(q2 + q + 1 − |D|)
≥ (q + 2√q − k)2 − (kq + 1)(q + 2√q − k) + k(q2 + q + 1 − 2(q + √q + 1))
> −2(q + 2√q − k) − 1 + (kq + 1) + (−3q − 4√q − 1)
≥ q√q − 4q − 6√q − 1,

(2.4)

a contradiction if q ≥ 27.
All in all, we have to exclude the only remaining case k = (cid:4)√q(cid:5) + 1 and |PD| = q +(cid:4)√q(cid:5).
It will be handled by reﬁning the estimate 0 ≥ w(PD) .

10

2.4.3 Non-existence of D with k = (cid:4)√q(cid:5) + 1 and |PD| = q +(cid:4)√q(cid:5), q > 81
Substituting k = (cid:4)√q(cid:5) + 1 into (2.3) yields

w(PD) ≥ −3q − 4√q − 1.

(2.5)

We introduce the following

Deﬁnition 2.12. For any line ℓ, let the weight of ℓ be deﬁned as

w(ℓ) = (cid:26) 0

(|ℓ ∩ PD| − 1)(|ℓ ∩ PD| − k)

if ℓ ∩ PD = ∅,
otherwise.

We call a line ℓ heavy if w(ℓ) < 0 (these are exactly the secants which are neither tangents,
nor maximal secants).

If a line ℓ is ﬁxed and P ∈ ℓ, let wℓ(P ) = Pl : P∈l6=ℓ w(l).

This deﬁnition provides that for any line ℓ,

w(PD) = w(ℓ) +XP∈ℓ

wℓ(P ).

(2.6)

This enables us to study how a line, depending on how many points it has in PD, eﬀects
w(PD), for which (2.5) is a lower bound. According to the following lemma, the length of
a secant of PD can take on very few values only.
Lemma 2.13. Suppose that k = (cid:4)√q(cid:5) + 1 and |PD| = q +(cid:4)√q(cid:5), q > 81. Then every line
intersects PD in 0, 1, k − 1 or k points.
Proof. Let ℓ be an m-secant, 2 ≤ m ≤ k − 2. Let P ∈ ℓ \ PD. Suppose that P
is covered by a k-secant. Let s(P ) be the number of skew lines to PD on P . Then
|PD| ≥ m + k + (q − 1 − s(P )), so s(P ) ≥ m + k + q − 1 − |PD| = m. Let t be the number
of points in ℓ\PD that are covered by a k-secant. As all skew lines are in LD, we see that
t ≤ |LD|/m. Note that |LD|/m + m ≤ |LD|/2 + 2 whenever 2 ≤ m ≤ |LD|/2 (recall that
q ≤ |LD| ≤ q + √q + 2), thus at least

q + 1 − m − |LD|/m ≥
points of ℓ \ PD are not covered by any k-secant.
Suppose now that P is not covered by any k-secant. As |PD| > q + m, there must be
another heavy line on P besides ℓ, so −(k − 2) ≥ wℓ(P ). Also, −(k − 2) ≥ w(ℓ) =
(m − 1)(m − k) which, by (2.6) yields
−(cid:18) q − √q − 4

According to Lemma 2.13, we call a line ℓ a long secant if |ℓ ∩ PD| ≥ (cid:4)√q(cid:5). In our ﬁnal
step, we resolve the case when |PD| = q +(cid:4)√q(cid:5) = q + k − 1 and every long secant of PD
is of size (cid:4)√q(cid:5) or (cid:4)√q(cid:5) + 1.
We call a point of type (α, β) if α is the number of k-secants and β is the number of k − 1
secants through it. Then α(k−1)+β(k−2)+1 = |PD| = q+k−1 holds. The non negative
solutions of this Diophantine equation are of form {(α0 − t(k − 2), β0 + t(k − 1)), t ∈ N}.
Since β ∈ [0, q+k−2
k−2 ]∩ Z, we have at most two types of points in PD; more precisely, β0 > 4
implies that every point is incident to the same number of k-secants and (k − 1)-secants
(if q ≥ 36).
Let a and b denote the number of points of type (α0, β0) and of type (α0 − (k − 2), β0 +
(k − 1)), respectively. Note that a + b = q + k − 1. We can determine the number N of
k-secants and number N′ of k − 1-secants with a simple double counting argument:

N =

aα0 + b(α0 − k + 2)

and N′ =

aβ0 + b(β0 + k − 1)

(2.7)

The number M of exterior points is q2 + q + 1 − |PD| = q2 − k + 2.
Let pi denote the number of long secants through the ith exterior point. Then the (dual)
standard equations give

Either there exists an exterior point P incident with at least three long secants, or pi ∈
{1, 2} ∀i ∈ {1, . . . , M}.
In the former case, let ℓ be a skew line to PD on P . Then,
as each non-secant line through P and each point of ℓ must be dominated, we obtain
|D| ≥ 3(k − 1) + (q − 3) + q > 2(q + ⌊√q⌋ + 1) if q > 25, a contradiction.

Otherwise, consider the expression

enough, where feasibility means that √q < k ≤ √q + 1, 0 ≤ β0 ≤ q+k−2
which we always assume in the sequel; moreover, all these parameters are integers.
First we show that if β0 ≥ 2 and q is large enough, then F (q, k, β0, b) < 0, hence (2.10)
has no feasible solutions even among real numbers.
Suppose ﬁrst that b = 0. Then the coeﬃcient of the leading term of F (q, k, β0, 0)·k2(k−1)2
in q is increasing in k on the interval [√q,√q + 1]; for k = √q + 1, it is (3 − 2β0) which,
if q is large enough, indeed yields F (q, k, β0, 0) < 0 as β0 ≥ 2. To keep the bound
on q suﬃciently low, applying formal and numerical calculations it can be shown that
F (q, k, β0, 0) is convex in k on the interval [√q,√q + 1] for any ﬁxed β0 ≥ 0 (if q ≥ 60),
and it is decreasing in β0 on the interval [0, q+√q−2
√q−2 ] for any ﬁxed k ∈ [√q,√q + 1] (if
q ≥ 126). As for any q ≥ 21, F (q,√q, 2, 0) and F (q,√q + 1, 2, 0) are both negative, we
conclude that if β0 ≥ 2 and q ≥ 126, then F (q, k, β0, 0) < 0, hence there is no feasible
solution for (2.10) with b = 0.
Now suppose b > 0, which implies β0 ≤ 4. One can calculate that in this case, if q ≥ 130,
F (q, k, β0, b) ≤ F (q, k, β0, 0), where the latter one is negative as we have seen before,
hence (2.10) has no feasible solutions with b ≥ 0 if β0 ≥ 2 and q ≥ 130.
Now it remains to handle the the cases (I) β0 = 0 and (II) β0 = 1. Taking into
consideration the integer values of (2.7) and the equation α0(k − 1) = q (case (I)) or
α0(k − 1) = q + k − 2 (case (II)), these conclude to the following possibilities:
(I.a) α0 = k − 1, β0 = 1, k = √q + 1, moreover k | 2b and N′ = b + k
(I.b) α0 = k, β0 = 1, k(k − 1) = q,
(I.c) α0 = k + 1, β0 = 1, k2 − 1 = q, moreover k | 2b − 2 and N′ = b + k + 2
(II.a) α0 = k, β0 = 0, k2 − 2k + 2 = q, moreover k | 2b and N′ = b
(II.b) α0 = k + 1, β0 = 0, q = k2 − k + 1, moreover k | 2b − 2 and N′ = b.
Solving (2.10) with these parameters, only (I.a) and (II.a) give feasible integer solutions
for b ∈ [0, q + k − 1], namely b = k/2 and b = k, respectively (if q ≥ 21). These cases can
be excluded by combinatorial reasoning: b ≥ 2 implies that there exist 2 points covering
at least 2(k − 1) − 1 (k − 1)-secants together, which is larger than N′ = 3
2k (case (I.a)) or
N′ = k (case (II.a)) (if q ≥ 25).
An exhaustive search for integer feasible solutions of (2.10) in case of q ≤ 130 shows that
if q ≥ 30, then every such solution comes with β0 = 0 or β1 = 1, so they can be excluded
by the above argument. All in all, we obtain that if q > 81, then (2.10) has no integer
feasible solutions that can be realized with a dominating set.

moreover k | 2b and N′ = b + k + 1

3 Dominating sets of PG(2, q)

In this section, using strong results on blocking sets of Desarguesian projective planes,
we strongly improve the general Theorem 1.5. Roughly we show that if a (not necessarily
primal) dominating set of PG(2, q) is signiﬁcantly smaller than 3q, then it must (almost)
contain a blocking or a covering set. Let us ﬁrst collect the results that have a key role
in this section.

Result 3.1 (Jamison [18], Brouwer–Schrijver [9]). A blocking set in a Desarguesian aﬃne
plane of order q has at least 2q − 1 points.
The above result is easily seen to be equivalent with the following.

Result 3.2. Let B be a blocking set of PG(2, q), and let P be an essential point for B.
Then there are at least 2q + 1 − |B| tangents to B through P .
Result 3.3 (Blokhuis [4]). A blocking set in PG(2, q), q prime, has at least 3
points, or contains a line.
Result 3.4 (Blokhuis–Storme–Sz˝onyi [8]). Let B be a blocking set in PG(2, q), q = ph >
16, p prime, that contains neither a line nor a Baer subplane. Let c2 = c3 = 2−1/3 and
cp = 1 for p > 3. Then |B| ≥ q + cpq2/3 + 1.
Note that the main result of [8] is more general as it concerns multiple blocking sets, but
we do not need it here.
Result 3.5 (Sz˝onyi–Weiner [21]). Let B be a set of points in PG(2, q), q = ph, h ≥ 2.
Denote the number of skew lines to B by δ, and suppose that δ ≤ 1
100pq. Assume that
|B| < 3

2(q + 1 − √2δ). Then B can be extended to a blocking set by adding at most

2(q + 1)

points to it.

2q + 1 − |B|

Result 3.6 (Sz˝onyi–Weiner [22]). Let B be a set of points of PG(2, q), q = p prime, with
at most 3
2(q + 1) − ε points. Suppose that the number δ of skew lines to B is less than
3(ε + 1)(cid:1)2
(cid:0) 2

/2. Then there is a line that contains at least q − 2δ

q+1 points of B.

A partial cover of PG(2, q) with h > 0 holes is a set of lines in PG(2, q) such that the
union of these lines covers all but exactly h points. We will also use the dual of the
following result due to Blokhuis, Brouwer and Sz˝onyi [7].

Result 3.7 ([7]). A partial cover of PG(2, q) with h > 0 holes, not all on one line if
h > 2, has size at least 2q − 1 − h/2.
Now we proceed with examining small dominating sets of PG(2, q).
dominating set, then Theorem 1.5 can be reﬁned in the following way.

If D is a primal

14

Theorem 3.8. Let D be a minimal primal dominating set of PG(2, q), q > 16. Deﬁne cp
as in Result 3.4. Then we have one of the cases (i)–(v) of Theorem 1.5 with the following
additions:

• case (b) of (iv) is not possible (nor its dual);
• if |D| < 3q − 1, then D is stable;
• if 3q − 1 > |D| > 2q +√q + 1, then either (a) |D| = 2q +√q + 2, and equality holds
if and only if there is a Baer subplane Π′ and a point P /∈ Π′ such that LD = [P ]
and PD = Π′ (or D is the dual structure), or (b) |D| ≥ 2q + cpq2/3 + 1.

D| − 1 + |L′

D|, where t(Q) is the set of tangents to P′
D
D|. The details are left for the reader.

Proof. Throughout we suppose that |D| < 3q − 1. Suppose ﬁrst that |D| > 2q + √q + 1.
Then we have case (iv) of Theorem 1.5. Assume that D is stable. Let B be the minimal
In case (a), either B is a Baer subplane, or |B| ≥
blocking set of cases (a) or (b).
q +cpq2/3 +1. In the former case, |D| > 2q +√q +1 yields P /∈ B, whence |D| = 2q +√q +2
and the assertion follows. In the latter case, |D| ≥ q + 1 + |B| − 1 > 2q + cpq2/3 + 1. In
case (b), by Result 2.3, |B| ≥ 2q − 1, so |D| ≥ q + 2 + |B| − 1 = 3q.
Now we claim that there cannot be a non-stable primal dominating set of size less than
3q − 1. To prove this, we follow the steps and notation of the proof of the respective
part of Theorem 1.5 (page 6). By duality we may assume that v = Q is a point. Then
|D| ≥ |P′
D| + |t(Q) \ L′
through Q.
By Result 3.2, |t(Q)| ≥ 2q + 1 − |P′
For q ≤ 16, some weaker results prior to 3.4, see [1, Section 5], provide useful bounds on
blocking sets that could be applied in the proof. Not to get lost in details, we omitted
including these. It follows, however, that already for q ≥ 9, |D| = 2q + √q + 2 is possible
if and only if D is the union of a Baer subplane and a full pencil (or the dual structure).
Next we treat non-primal dominating sets. The next proposition can be regarded as a
strengthening of Proposition 2.10. Recall that c is the maximal number of concurrent
lines in LD.
Proposition 3.9. Let D = (PD,LD) be a non-primal dominating set in PG(2, q), q = ph,
p prime. If |D| +|PD| ≤ 4q − 3, then PD is a blocking set. Dually, if |D| +|LD| ≤ 4q − 3,
then LD is a covering set.
Proof. Suppose that |D| + |PD| ≤ 4q − 3. If PD blocks all but exactly 0 < h ≤ |LD| lines,
then the dual of Result 3.7 yields two options. The ﬁrst option is |PD| ≥ 2q − 1−|LD|/2,
which gives |D| +|PD| ≥ 4q − 2, a contradiction. The second option is that all the h lines
not blocked by PD go through one point, say, P . But then PD ∪ {P} is a blocking set in
PG(2, q), for which P is an essential point. Then there are at least 2q − |PD| (Result 3.2)
skew lines to PD through P . This means c ≥ 2q − |PD|. On the other hand, Proposition
2.10 gives c ≤ |PD| − q + 1 (under c < q, so if D is not a primal dominating set). These
give 2|PD| ≥ 3q − 1. By Proposition 2.9, 4q − 3 ≥ |D| ≥ q2 + q − (q − 1)|LD|, whence
|LD| ≥ q − 1 follows, so |D| + |PD| ≥ 4q − 2, a contradiction. Thus we conclude that PD
is a blocking set.

15

Theorem 3.10. Let D be a non-primal dominating set in PG(2, q), q = ph, p prime.

• If |D| ≤ (5q − 3)/2, then PD is a blocking set and LD is a covering set.
• If |D| ≤ (8q−6)/3, then either |PD| ≤ |LD| and PD is a blocking set, or |LD| ≤ |PD|
and LD is a covering set.
• If |D| ≤ 3(q + 1 − 2√q), p ≥ 200, and h ≥ 2, then either |PD| ≤ |LD| and PD can
be extended to a blocking set by adding at most three points to it, or |LD| ≤ |PD|
and LD can be extended to a covering set by adding at most three lines to it.

Proof. Assume that |D| ≤ (5q− 3)/2. Then, as |LD| ≥ q (Proposition 2.9), |PD| ≤ |D|− q
follows, hence |D| + |PD| ≤ 4q − 3, thus Proposition 3.9 yields that PD is a blocking set.
By duality, LD is a covering set.
Suppose that |D| ≤ (8q − 6)/3. By duality we may assume |PD| ≤ |LD|. Then |PD| ≤
|D|/2, so |D| + |PD| ≤ 3|D|/2 ≤ 4q − 3, thus Proposition 3.9 applies.
Suppose now that |D| ≤ 3(q + 1−2√q), p ≥ 200, h ≥ 2. As |PD| ≥ q, |LD| = |D|−|PD| ≤
2(q +1−2√q) ≤ 3
2 (q +1−p2|LD|).
2q. By duality we may assume |PD| ≤ |LD|, so |PD| ≤ 3

Theorem 3.11. Let D = (PD ∪ LD) be a non-primal dominating set in PG(2, q), q = p
prime. Then

• |D| ≥ (8q − 5)/3;
• if |D| ≤ 3q + 3 − 6√q, then either |PD| ≤ |LD| and PD contains q − 3 collinear
points, or |LD| ≤ |PD| and LD contains q − 3 concurrent lines.

2(q + 1), hence |D| ≥ 3(q + 1), a contradiction.

Proof. If |D| ≤ (8q − 6)/3, then Theorem 3.10 yields that, say, |PD| ≤ |LD|, and PD is a
blocking set. As D is non-primal, PD must not contain a line, hence Blokhuis’ celebrated
Result 3.3 gives |PD| ≥ 3
2(q +1)−3√q,
Assume now |D| ≤ 3q +3−6√q and, by duality, |PD| ≤ |LD|. Then |PD| ≤ 3
9(3√q + 1)2, so Result 3.6 applies with ε = 3√q. Hence PD contains at
and |LD| ≤ 2q ≤ 2
least q − 4q/(q + 1) > q − 4 collinear points.
Remark 3.12. Some restrictions on |D| are indeed needed in Theorem 3.10. Let ℓ0 =
{P0, P1, . . . , Pq} be a line, let [P0] = {ℓ0, ℓ1, . . . , ℓq}, and let ℓ1 = {P0, Q1, Q2, . . . , Qq}.
Choose 1 ≤ t ≤ q − 1. Let us deﬁne PD as {P2, . . . , Pq, Q1, . . . , Qt}, and deﬁne LD as
{ℓ2, . . . , ℓq, P2Qt+1, . . . , P2Qq}. Then PD ∪ LD is a dominating set of size 3q − 2, and
neither PD is a blocking set, nor LD is a covering set.

16

Remark 3.13. Theorem 3.10 does not remain valid in non-Desarguesian projective planes.
E.g., there is a projective plane Πq (in fact, a Hall plane) of square order q that contains
Baer subplanes, and there is a suitable line ℓ ∈ Πq such that there is an aﬃne blocking
set B in Πq \ ℓ of size ⌊4q/3 + 5√q/3⌋ [12]. We may choose a dual Baer subplane S of
Πq that contains the line ℓ. Then B ∪ S is a dominating set of Πq of size ≈ 7q/3 < 5
2q,
yet its point set is not a blocking set of Πq.

4 Final remarks and open problems

We conjecture that |D| = 2(q +(cid:4)√q(cid:5) + 1) in Theorem 1.5 (vi) is only possible when q is a
square, PD forms a Baer subplane and LD forms a dual Baer subplane (if q is large). More
generally, it seems that if a small enough dominating set D contains neither q collinear
points nor q concurrent lines (i.e., it is not primal), then it must be the union of a blocking
set and a covering set. However, the plain description of the case of equality in Theorem
1.5 (iii) seems hard. It is closely related to our following conjecture.

Conjecture 4.1. Let Πq be an arbitrary projective plane of order q (q square, large
enough), and suppose that Π′ is a Baer subplane of Πq.
If a line set L of Πq of size
|L| ≤ q + √q + 1 covers all points of Πq not in Π′, then L is a covering set (so L also

covers the points of Π′).

In the above setting, if L is not a full pencil, then Π′∪L is a non-primal dominating set of
size at most 2q +2√q +2, hence it reaches equality in Theorem 1.5 (vi), so the conjectured
characterization would imply Conjecture 4.1. Note that if the plane is Desarguesian, then
Conjecture 4.1 is already implied by Theorem 1.7; moreover, with the help of stability
results on blocking sets, one can prove a much stronger assertion.
From a constructive point of view, if one considers a set P of points and the set L of lines
skew to P, then adds every point to P which is not covered by L, the obtained structure
will be a minimal dominating set.
In this way all dominating sets can be constructed
whose points and lines are pairwise not incident. In another terminology, these are the
1-dominating independent sets of the incidence graph, see [15, 19]. Note that avoiding
incidences is not necessary in general.

We have seen a strong connection between minimal dominating sets and minimal blocking
sets in Πq. The size of minimal blocking sets in Πq have a well known upper bound, namely
it exceed the size q3/2 + 1 of a unital [11]. Hence the question naturally rises whether
similar upper bounds exist concerning minimal dominating sets. Dominating independent
sets provide a wide range of examples with size close to q2.

The presented stability result, Theorem 1.5 can be viewed as a special case of the inves-
tigation of domination properties in combinatorial designs. This question was recently
raised by Goldberg et al. in [16] who proved several bounds on the domination number
of designs. As dominating sets and blocking sets are somewhat similar and related con-
cepts, let us mention that the study of blocking sets in combinatorial designs started much
earlier, see e.g. the paper of Bruen and Thas [11].

In projective planes, t-fold blocking sets play an important role as well. On the other
hand, multiple domination also has a broad literature (see e.g. [14, 17]) which yields the
following problem.

Problem 4.2. Describe small minimal t-dominating sets in arbitrary or in Desarguesian
projective planes.

Once small minimal dominating sets are classiﬁed, a natural extremal question would be
to study the following

Problem 4.3. Determine the order of magnitude of the number of dominating sets, in-
dependent dominating sets, minimal dominating sets in projective planes.
