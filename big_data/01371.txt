HAMILTONIAN PRISMS ON 5-CHORDAL GRAPHS

GAO MOU

Abstract. In this paper, we provide a method to ﬁnd a Hamiltonian cycle
in the prism of a 5-chordal graph, which is (1 + ǫ)-tough, with some special
conditions.

1. Preliminaries

The toughness of graphs is a concept introduced by Chv´atal [6], when he was
doing research on Hamiltonicity of graphs. A graph G is called β-tough, if for any
p ≥ 2, it cannot be split into p components by deleting less than nβ vertices. It
is not diﬃcult to prove that every k-tough graph is 2k-connected. A graph G is
called k-chordal, if for any circle C in G with length |C| ≥ k, C has a chord in
G. Usually, we call a 3-chordal graph a chordal graph for convenience. Clearly, a
chordal graph is also k-chordal for any k ≥ 3.

Chv´atal posed a famous conjecture, which is still open today, saying that there
exists a constant β such that every β-tough graph is Hamiltonian. Clearly, being
1-tough is a necessary condition for being Hamiltonian. What is more, there ex-
ist 2-tough graphs which are not Hamiltonian [1]. In recent decades, researchers
found many special classes of graphs for which Chv´atal’s conjecture is true, for
example, chordal graphs [9], 2K2-free graphs [5], and planar graphs [12]. Moreover,
researchers are also interested in many kinds of analogies of Hamiltonian cycles,
such as k-walks, Hamiltonian-prisms, and 2-factors. A k-walk in a graph G is a
closed walk visiting each vertex of G at least once but at most k times. Clearly, a
Hamiltonian cycle can be considered as a 1-walk. And a p-walk is trivially a q-walk,
for integers p ≤ q. The prism over a graph G is the Cartesian product G × K2 of
G with the complete graph K2. If G × K2 is Hamiltonian, then we say G is prism-
Hamiltonian, and we call G × K2 the Hamilton-prism of G. It is not diﬃcult to
prove that being prism-Hamiltonian is a property stronger than admitting 2-walk
but weaker than being Hamiltonian [10]. For k-walks in graphs, there is also a
well-known open conjecture, which is posed by Jackson and Wormald, saying that
every 1
k−1 -tough graph admits a k-walk [8]. A 2-factor in a graph is a spanning
subgraph, which is consisted of several disjoint cycles. An edge-dominating cycle C
in a graph G is a cycle such that the induced subgraph on V (G) − V (C) contains
no edge.

Here we list several well-known results relative chordal graphs and 5-chordals on

the topic of Hamiltonicity.

Theorem 5. [2] Every 3

The main result in this paper is following:

2. Main Results

Theorem 6. Let G be a (1 + ǫ)-tough 5-chordal graph, if G contains an edge-
dominating cycle, then G is prism-Hamiltonian.

The proof of this theorem is consisted of the following two lemmas, one of which

is from [7], while another is new.

Lemma 1. [7] Let G be (1 + ǫ)-tough, for some ǫ > 0.

(1) If G contains an edge-dominating cycle C with even number of vertices,

then the prism over G is Hamiltonian.

(2) If G contains an edge-dominating cycle C = v1v2 · · · v2p+1v1 of odd length,
and there are three vertices v1, v2q and v2q+1, for some 1 ≤ q ≤ p, inducing
a triangle in G, then the prism over G is Hamiltonian.

Lemma 2. Assuing C = v1v2 · · · vpv1 is a cycle of odd length in a 5-chordal G,
then there exist three vertices vi, vi+2q−1, vi+2q of C (the index is in module p),
which induce a triangle in G.

Proof. If p = 3, then let i = 1 and q = 1, so the result holds trivially. If p ≥ 5,
then by 5-chordality, there must be an chord on C. Without loss of generality, we
can assume that v1 is one endpoint of a chord e. If another endpoint of e is v3,
then we have proved the result. Otherwise, e = v1vt divides C into two cycles:
C1 = v1v2 · · · vtv1 and C2 = v1vt · · · vt+1vpv1.

If t is odd, then by mathematical induction, we can ﬁnd triangle with the prop-

erty we want in C1.

If t is even, then we can relabel the vertices of C2 by v′

3 = vt+1
and so on. Clearly, this relabelling process does not change the odd-even of the
index. So, by mathematical induction, there is a triangle we want in C2, and this
triangle is also the one we want in C.

1 = v1, v′

2 = vt, v′

(cid:3)

Combining the two lemmas above, we have ﬁnished the proof of Theorem 6

3. Applications

Now, we are interested in the question that under what condition, we can ﬁnd
an edge-dominating cycle in a 5-chordal graph? Here we list several well-known
results on this topic.

Lemma 3. [4] Let G be a 2-connected graph of order n. If

δ3(G) := min{X

i≤3

d(xi)|x1, x2, x3are independent vertices in G} ≥ n + 2,

then all longest cycles in G are edge-dominating.

Two edges are called remote if they are disjoint and there is no edge joining
them. Let NG(v) stand for the set of vertices in G which are adjacent to v. For an
edge e = uv in G, we deﬁne the degree d(e) of e by d(e) = |NG(u) ∪ NG(v) − {u, v}|.

Lemma 4. [13] Let G be a k-connected graph (k ≥ 2) such that, for every k + 1
mutually remote edges e0, e1, . . . , ek of G,

k

d(ei) >

k(|V (G)| − k).

Then G contains an edge-dominating cycle.

Lemma 5. [14] Let G be a 2-connected graph. If d(e1) + d(e2) > |V (G)| − 4 for
any remote edges e1, e2, then all longest cycles in G are edge-dominating cycles.

Combining the three lemmas above and Theorem 6, we get the following corol-

laries.

Corollary 1. Let G be a (1 + ǫ)-tough 5-chordal graph of order n. If

then G is prism-Hamiltonian.

δ3(G) ≥ n + 2,

Corollary 2. Let G be a (1 + ǫ)-tough 5-chordal graph such that, for every 3
mutual remote edges e1, e2, e3 of G,

d(ei) >

(|V (G)| − 3).

Corollary 3. Let G be a (1+ǫ)-tough 5-chordal graph. If d(e1)+d(e2) > |V (G)|−4
for any remote edges e1, e2, then G is prism-Hamiltonian.

Remarks 1. The results in this paper is almost trivial now. So, we are looking for
some “non-trivial” condition for 5-chordal graphs to have edge-dominating cycles.
Especially, we hope to ﬁnd a toughness condition for 5-chordal graphs to have such
cycles.
