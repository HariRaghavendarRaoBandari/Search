THE CHROMATIC NUMBER OF FINITE TYPE-GRAPHS

CHRISTIAN AVART, BILL KAY, CHRISTIAN REIHER, AND VOJTĚCH RÖDL

Abstract. By a ﬁnite type-graph we mean a graph whose set of vertices is the set of all
k-subsets of rns “ t1, 2, . . . , nu for some integers n ě k ě 1, and in which two such sets
are adjacent if and only if they realize a certain order type speciﬁed in advance. Examples
of such graphs have been investigated in a great variety of contexts in the literature with
particular attention being paid to their chromatic number.
In recent joint work with
Tomasz Łuczak, two of the authors embarked on a systematic study of the chromatic
numbers of such type-graphs, formulated a general conjecture determining this number
up to a multiplicative factor, and proved various results of this kind. In this article we
fully prove this conjecture.

§1. Motivation

Our goal in this article is to analyze the asymptotic behaviour of the chromatic number
of certain ﬁnite graphs, that are called type-graphs in the sequel. In general the vertex
set of such a graphs is, for some positive integers n ě k, the collection of all k-element
subsets of the set rns “ t1, 2, . . . , nu. Whether two such subsets are to be connected
by an edge or not is decided solely in terms of the mutual position of their elements or,
equivalently, it only depends on the order type that this pair of sets realizes. Before
deﬁning these type-graphs accurately, we would like to ﬁx some notation concerning order
types of pairs of ordered sets.
In particular we shall encode such order types as ﬁnite
sequences consisting of ones, twos, and threes. At ﬁrst sight, allowing rational numbers
in the deﬁnition that follows might look unnecessarily general, but it will turn out to be
useful at a later occasion.
Deﬁnition 1.1. Let X and Y be two ﬁnite sets of rational numbers with |X Y Y | “ ‘
and X Y Y “ tz1, z2, . . . , z‘u, these elements being listed in increasing order. We say that
the order type of the pair pX, Y q is the sequence τ “ pτ1, . . . , τ‘q and set τpX, Y q “ τ if

τi “

if zi P XzY ,
if zi P Y zX ,
if zi P X X Y .

For example, given X “ t1, 2, 3, 5u and Y “ t3, 4, 5u we get τpX, Y q “ 11323. Clearly
for any ﬁnite sequence τ consisting of ones, twos, and threes there are two ﬁnite subsets X
and Y of Q with τ “ τpX, Y q and in fact one may even ﬁnd such sets with X, Y Ď N.

The case most relevant for the deﬁnition of type-graphs below is |X| “ |Y |.

Deﬁnition 1.2. Consider two nonnegative integers k and ‘. By a type of width k and
length ‘ we mean the order type of a pair pX, Y q with X, Y Ď Q, |X| “ |Y | “ k, and
|X Y Y | “ ‘.

So τ “ 123312 is a type of width 4 and length 6 that is realized, e.g., by X “ t1, 3, 4, 7u
and Y “ t2, 3, 4, 9u. It is not hard to observe that in any type of width k and length ‘
there appear ‘´ k ones, ‘´ k twos, and 2k ´ ‘ threes. As a degenerate case we regard the
empty sequence ∅ as an empty type of width and length 0. A type is said to be trivial if
it consists of threes only, or in other words if its width equals its length.

Now we are prepared to deﬁne the main objects under consideration in this article.

Deﬁnition 1.3. For a nontrivial type τ of width k and an integer n ě k, the type-graph
Gpn, τq is the graph with vertex set
in which two vertices X and Y are declared to
be adjacent if and only if we have τpX, Y q “ τ or τpY, Xq “ τ.

Such graphs and their chromatic numbers have been studied in numerous articles. For
example, it is known that the shift graph Gpn, 132q has chromatic number rlogpnqs, where
the base of the logarithm is 2.
It is straightforward to check that these shift graphs
are triangle-free, and thus they provide explicit examples of triangle-free graphs with
arbitrarily large chromatic number. More generally, Erdős and Hajnal [3] considered the
type-graph Gpn, σkq with

and the inﬁnite analogues of this graph that naturally arise when one replaces the ﬁnite
number n by an arbitrary cardinal number. Concerning the chromatic number of the ﬁnite
graphs Gpn, σkq they obtained the following result that we will apply later.

Here for any t P N and any suﬃciently large n P N, we denote the t-fold iterated base 2
logarithm of n by logptqpnq. Strictly speaking Erdős and Hajnal did mainly focus on the
case where n is inﬁnite, see [3, Lemma 2], but their method of proof applies to ﬁnite values
of n as well. The thus adapted proof may be found with more details in [2] or [7]. In the
latter reference, the alternative language of ordered Ramsey theory is used. We note that
the inﬁnite case of Theorem 1.4 has applications to the computation of inﬁnite Ramsey
numbers [3, Theorem 1] and refer the reader interested in further applications of inﬁnite
type-graphs to [9], [4], [6], and [5].

Another interesting consequence of Theorem 1.4 is that it provides us with explicit
examples of graphs having large chromatic number and large odd girth.
In fact, any
odd cycle contained in Gpn, σkq has at least the length 2k ` 1. This line of thought was
substantially continued by Nešetřil and Rödl, who used unions of general type-graphs in
some of their early work on structural Ramsey theory, see e.g. [8].

The problem of determining the chromatic number of general ﬁnite type-graphs was
recently approached in joint work of Łuzcak and two of the current authors [1]. The
last section of that article contains a conjecture, restated as Theorem 1.8 below, that
predicts this number asymptotically up to a constant multiplicative factor. In particular
this conjecture implies that for each nontrivial type τ there exists a nonnegative integer β
with χ
as n tends to inﬁnity. When intending to calculate β
from τ the ﬁrst thing one has to do is to express τ as a product of as many other types as
possible. The next two deﬁnitions help us to talk about this process:
Deﬁnition 1.5. Given two ﬁnite sequences τ “ pτ1, . . . , τ‘q and τ1 “ pτ1
write τ τ1 for their concatenation pτ1, . . . , τ‘, τ1
Deﬁnition 1.6. A nonempty type is said to be irreducible if it cannot be written as the
concatenation of two nonempty types.

It should be clear that each nonempty type τ can be written in a unique manner as
the concatenation of several irreducible types. In fact, one ﬁnds this unique factorization
of τ by keeping track of the numbers of ones and twos already encountered while reading
τ from left to right, and starting a new factor at every moment where these two numbers
Gpn, τq
are equal. As it will turn out, most of our work concerning χ
addresses the
irreducible case. Once it is solved, the reducible case reduces to that case.

`

˘

In the next section, we describe an algorithm which partitions any given irreducible
type τ into so-called blocks. Notice that if τ is trivial, i.e., a string of threes, we must
have τ “ 3 and in this case the number of blocks is going to be 1. On the other hand, any
nontrivial irreducible type is going to be partitioned into at least 2 blocks.

The rest of this article is structured as follows: In Section 2 we describe the block
algorithm and thus clarify the meaning of our main results. Then the next two sections
are dedicated to the proofs of the lower and upper bounds appearing in Theorem 1.7.
Finally, in Section 5 we will deduce Theorem 1.8 by means of a product argument.

§2. The block algorithm

In this section we describe an algorithm partitioning the terms of any irreducible type τ
into blocks of consecutive terms. We will call this algorithm the block algorithm and the
partition it produces will be referred to as the block decomposition of τ.

As said above, if τ is trivial we have τ “ 3 by irreducibility. In this special case we
regard τ as consisting of one block only, namely τ itself. If τ ‰ 3, then the ﬁrst digit of τ
is either a one or a two, because otherwise we could write τ “ 3 for some type  ‰ ∅,
contrary to the irreducibility of τ. We call τ primary if it starts with a one and secondary
if it starts with a two.

Given a subsequence B of a type τ that consists of consecutive terms, we write 1pBq
for the total number of ones and threes occurring in B, and 2pBq for the total number of
twos and threes in B.

Now we are ready to explain how the block algorithm is applied to any primary irre-

ducible type τ. Processing τ from left to right we are to perform the following steps:

(i ) The ﬁrst block B1 consists of all the initial ones appearing in τ.
(ii ) In general, if the block Bi has just been constructed, the next block Bi`1 consists
of the next consecutive digits of τ such that 2pBi`1q “ 1pBiq and such that subject
to this condition the block Bi`1 is as long as possible.

(iii ) The algorithm stops when all the terms of τ have been placed in a block.

THE CHROMATIC NUMBER OF FINITE TYPE-GRAPHS

5
E.g., for the type τ “ 1121112121212222 we get B1 “ 11, B2 “ 211121, B3 “ 212122,
and ﬁnally B4 “ 22. One may use appropriate spacing to make the outcome of the block
algorithm notationally visible and write, for instance,

τ “ 11 211121 212122 22 .

Similarly the type 131122311222 decomposes into

1 311 22311 222

and for the type σ4 “ 13332 that we have already encountered in (1.1) the algorithm
produces

σ4 “ 1 3 3 3 2 .

Fact 2.1. When applied to a primary irreducible type τ the block algorithm does indeed
provide a factorization τ “ B1B2 ¨ . . . ¨ Bb of τ into some nonempty blocks B1, . . . , Bb,
where b ě 2. Moreover, we have 1pBbq “ 0.
Proof. Since τ starts with a one, rule (i ) gives us a ﬁrst block B1 ‰ ∅. Now let i
be the largest integer for which the block algorithm produces in its ﬁrst i steps some
nonempty blocks B1, . . . , Bi. This happens by an initial application of (i ) followed by i´1
applications of (ii ). Let C denote the ﬁnite sequence satisfying

τ “ B1 ¨ . . . ¨ BiC .

(2.1)
We intend to show that either C “ ∅ so that the algorithm stops, or 0 ă 1pBiq ď 2pCq,
meaning that the algorithm produces a further nonempty block Bi`1. The latter alterna-
tive, however, would contradict the maximality of i.

Recall that by construction we have 2pB1q “ 0 and 1pBjq “ 2pBj`1q for all j P ri ´ 1s.

This yields

1pB1 ¨ . . . ¨ Bi´1q “ 2pB1 ¨ . . . ¨ Biq

(2.2)
and in combination with (2.1) and 1pτq “ 2pτq it follows that 1pBiq ď 1pBiCq “ 2pCq.
So if 1pBiq ą 0 we could use (ii ) once more to obtain the next nonempty block Bi`1,
contrary to the maximality of i.

Thus we must have 1pBiq “ 0 and (2.2) entails that B1 ¨ . . . ¨ Bi is a type. By (2.1) and
the irreducibility of τ it follows that C “ ∅, meaning that the algorithm stops with a ﬁnal
application of rule (iii ). Now b “ i, the moreover-part was obtained at the beginning of
this paragraph, and b ě 2 is clear.
(cid:3)

So far we have only talked about primary types. For dealing with secondary types we
use the following symmetry: If τ denotes any ﬁnite sequence of ones, twos, and threes, we

CHRISTIAN AVART, BILL KAY, CHRISTIAN REIHER, AND VOJTĚCH RÖDL

6
write τ1 for the sequence obtained from τ by replacing all ones by twos and vice versa.
Evidently if τ is a secondary irreducible type, then τ1 is a primary irreducible type and
thus we already know how to ﬁnd its block decomposition τ1 “ B1B2¨. . .¨Bb. Now we have
τ “ B1
b and we deﬁne this to be the block decomposition of τ. In particular, τ
and τ1 have the same numbers of blocks.

Notice that if τpX, Y q “  holds for some ﬁnite sets X, Y Ď Q, then τpY, Xq “ 1
follows. In particular, for any type τ the two type-graphs Gpn, τq and Gpn, τ1q are the
same and thus it suﬃces to prove Theorem 1.7 for primary τ.

1B1

2 ¨ . . . ¨ B1

We conclude this section with two statements concerning irreducible types and the block

algorithm that will be employed in Section 4.
Lemma 2.2. Suppose that τ is a primary irreducible type of width k and that X, Y Ď Q
are two ﬁnite sets with τ “ τpX, Y q. Let X “ tx1, . . . , xku and Y “ ty1, . . . , yku, the
elements being listed in increasing order. Then we have

(a ) xi ă yi for all i P rks
(b ) and xi`1 ď yi for all i P rk ´ 1s.

Proof. Let τ “ pτ1, . . . , τ‘q, where ‘ denotes the length of τ. We contend that

if i P rk ´ 1s and xi ď yi, then xi`1 ď yi.

(2.3)

To show this, let yi be the m-th element in the increasing enumeration of X Y Y .
In
view of 1 ď i ă k we have 1 ď m ă ‘ and thus pτ1, . . . , τmq cannot be a type due to the
irreducibility of τ. This in turn yields |X X p´8, yis| ‰ |Y X p´8, yis| “ i. But assuming
xi ď yi the number |X Xp´8, yis| is at least i, so that altogether it must be at least i` 1,
which means that xi`1 ď yi. This proves (2.3).

Next we show (a ) by induction on i. The base case x1 ă y1 follows from τ being
primary. For the induction step we suppose that xi ă yi holds for some i ă k. Then (2.3)
entails xi`1 ď yi ă yi`1, which concludes the argument.

Finally (b ) is an immediate consequence of (2.3) and (a ).

(cid:3)

We now come to the only place in the proof of Theorem 1.7 where the demand from
the second rule of the block algorithms that the blocks should end with as many ones as
possible is utilized. The purpose of the following lemma is that, roughly speaking, it tells
us how the “blocks” of two ﬁnite sets X and Y realizing an irreducible type τ overlap each
other. This will be useful in Subsection 4.1 for embedding Gpn, τq into an auxiliary graph
whose chromatic number is easier to bound from above.

Lemma 2.3. Let τ “ B1B2¨. . .¨Bb be the block decomposition of some primary irreducible
type whose width is k and set spiq “ 2pB1 ¨ . . . ¨ Biq for all i P rbs. Then for any two
sets X and Y satisfying τ “ τpX, Y q, say X “ tx1, . . . , xku and Y “ ty1, . . . , yku with the
elements listed in increasing order, we have xspi`1q ă yspiq`1 ď xspi`1q`1 for all i P rb ´ 2s.
ř
Proof. Let X Y Y “ tz1, . . . , z‘u, the elements again being listed in increasing order. Fix
j“1 |Bj|. By rule (ii ) of the block algorithm the block Bi`1
any i P rb ´ 2s and set β “
cannot start with a one and thus we have zβ`1 P Y . In combination with

i

spiq “ 2pB1 ¨ . . . ¨ Biq “ |Y X p´8, zβs|

yspiq`1 “ zβ`1 .

(2.4)

this yields

Similarly we have

spi ` 1q “ 2pB1 ¨ . . . ¨ Bi`1q “ 1pB1 ¨ . . . ¨ Biq “ |X X p´8, zβs|

and thus xspi`1q ď zβ as well as zβ`1 ď xspi`1q`1. The desired conclusion follows from these
(cid:3)
two estimates and (2.4).

§3. The lower bound – uncolourability

In this section we shall prove the lower bound from Theorem 1.7. So we intend to show
that a certain graph Gpn, τq cannot be coloured with a certain “small” number of colours.
Recall that for any graph H and any natural number r, the statement χpHq ą r means the
same as saying that there is no graph homomorphism from H to the r-clique Kr. Thus
one strategy to prove such an uncolourability statement is to exhibit a homomorphism
from some auxiliary graph G to H, with χpGq ą r already being known. So in the light
of Theorem 1.4 our task reduces to:

Proposition 3.1. For every nontrivial irreducible type τ of width k with b blocks and
every integer n ě b there is a graph homomorphism

ϕ: Gpn, σb´1q ÝÑ Gpkn, τq .

For the construction of such a homomorphism, we will make use of the following

Fact 3.2. If B denotes a ﬁnite sequence of ones, twos, and threes, and Y Ď Q has
size 2pBq, then there is a set X Ď Q with τpX, Y q “ B.

This can easily be shown by induction on the number of ones appearing in B and we

leave the details to the reader.

8
CHRISTIAN AVART, BILL KAY, CHRISTIAN REIHER, AND VOJTĚCH RÖDL
Proof of Proposition 3.1. As said above we may assume that τ is primary. Let

τ “ B1B2 ¨ . . . ¨ Bb

be the block decomposition of τ. We commence by deﬁning recursively an auxiliary
sequence R0, R1, . . . , Rb of ﬁnite subsets of Q with

|Ri´1| “ 2pBiq

for all i P rbs .

(3.1)
Since B1 consists exclusively of ones, such a sequence needs to start with R0 “ ∅.
Once Ri´1 has been deﬁned for some i P rbs, we use Fact 3.2 to obtain a set Ri Ď Q
satisfying τpRi, Ri´1q “ Bi. Notice that for i ă b this yields |Ri| “ 1pBiq “ 2pBi`1q, so
that the construction may be continued. We also get |Rb| “ 1pBbq “ 0 and hence Rb “ ∅
from Fact 2.1.

In view of (3.1) we have

2pBiq “ 2pτq “ k
and thus there exist k rational numbers α1 ă . . . ă αk with

§4. The upper bound – constructing colourings

This entire section is dedicated to the proof of the upper bound from Theorem 1.7. The
strategy we use is to embed the type-graph Gpn, τq into some other graph Gb´1pnq that
depends solely on b and n but not on τ itself. Thereby the task we are to perform gets
reduced to the problem of colouring these auxiliary graphs with “few” colours and it seems
that this new problem is more susceptible to an inductive treatment than the old one.
4.1. Embedding type-graphs. We begin by deﬁning the auxiliary graphs Gbpnq men-
tioned above.

Deﬁnition 4.1. For any positive integers b and n we set

Wbpnq “ tpx1, . . . , x2b´1q| 1 ď x1 ď x2 ď . . . ď x2b´1 ď nu

and

Vbpnq “ tpx1, . . . , x2b´1q P Wbpnq| x1 ă x3 ă . . . ă x2b´1u .

yu, á
á

By Gbpnq we mean the graph with vertex set Vbpnq in which an unordered pair e Ď
Vbpnq is declared to be an edge if we can write e “ tá
x “ px1, . . . , x2b´1q, and
x,
y “ py1, . . . , y2b´1q such that
á

(i ) x1 ă y1 ď x3 ă y3 ď . . . ď x2b´1 ă y2b´1
(ii ) and xj`1 ď yj for j P r2b ´ 2s.
It should perhaps be observed that the conditions (i ) and (ii ) from this deﬁnition do
not determine uniquely how the elements of the multiset tx1, . . . , x2b´1u Y ty1, . . . , y2b´1u
are ordered. This makes it more plausible, of course, that many type-graphs embed
homomorphically into Gbpnq and in fact we have
Theorem 4.2. For any nontrivial irreducible type τ with b ě 2 blocks and every positive
integer n there is a graph homomorphism ϕ: Gpn, τq ÝÑ Gb´1pnq.
Proof. As usual we may assume that τ is a primary type of width k, say. Let τ “ B1 ¨ . . . ¨ Bb
be its block decomposition and deﬁne spiq “ 2pB1 ¨ . . . ¨ Biq for any i P rbs. Since

10
whenever 1 ď x1 ă . . . ă xk ď n. So roughly speaking ϕ remembers where the “blocks”
of such a set tx1, . . . , xku start and end and forgets everything else.

It remains to verify that ϕ sends edges of Gpn, τq to edges of Gb´1pnq. For this purpose let
any two vertices X and Y of Gpn, τq with τpX, Y q “ τ be given and write X “ tx1, . . . , xku
as well as Y “ ty1, . . . , yku, listing the elements in increasing order. We need to show that
tϕpXq, ϕpY qu is an edge of Gb´1pnq, i.e., that the clauses (i ) and (ii ) from Deﬁnition 4.1
are satisﬁed.

Now by Lemma 2.2 (a ) we have in particular xspiq`1 ă yspiq`1 for all i P rb ´ 1s and
Lemma 2.3 tells us that yspiq`1 ď xspi`1q`1 holds for all i P rb ´ 2s. Both statements
together yield condition (i ) from Deﬁnition 4.1.

For the veriﬁcation of (ii ) we consider the cases that the index j appearing there is
odd or even separately. To deal with the case where j is odd we need to check that
xspi`1q ď yspiq`1 holds for all i P rb´ 2s and Lemma 2.3 informs us that this is indeed true.
For even j we need that xspi`1q`1 ď yspi`1q holds for all i P rb ´ 2s and this was obtained
(cid:3)
in Lemma 2.2 (b ).

Now it is clear that in order to complete the proof of Theorem 1.7 we just need to

establish the following result.

Theorem 4.3. For every positive integer b we have

2pb´1q2 ` op1q

logpb´1qpnq .

Throughout the rest of this section we deal with the proof this theorem. We will proceed
by induction on b, considering the base cases b “ 1 and b “ 2 separately. The main idea
for the induction step is to relate the graphs Gbp2nq to Gb´1pnq to each other. Roughly
speaking, we will show that for any b ě 3 the vertex set of the graph Gbp2nq may be
split into about 22b´3 pieces, each of which induces a graph that embeds homomorphically
into Gb´1pnq. For the construction of half of these homomorphisms it will be helpful to
bear the following symmetry in mind.
Fact 4.4. For any positive integers b and n the bijection η : Vbp2nq ÝÑ Vbp2nq given by

is an automorphism of Gbp2nq.

We leave the easy proof of this assertion to the reader.

We also identify subsets of V2p2mq with the subgraphs of G2p2mq that they induce. Ev-

Moreover, using condition (ii ) from Deﬁnition 4.1 it is easy to check that the sets B and C
are independent. This concludes the proof of (4.2) and, thus, the proof of Lemma 4.5. (cid:3)
Before we proceed to the colouring of Gbp2nq for b ě 3 we introduce some auxiliary

`

functions.
Lemma 4.6. Given any integers x and y with 1 ď x ă y there exist a positive integer f
and an odd positive integer q such that

pq ´ 1q ¨ 2f´1 ă x ď q ¨ 2f´1 ă y ď pq ` 1q ¨ 2f´1 .

Moreover, f and q are uniquely determined by x and y so that we may write f “ fpx, yq
as well as q “ qpx, yq.

CHRISTIAN AVART, BILL KAY, CHRISTIAN REIHER, AND VOJTĚCH RÖDL

Proof. Let us ﬁrst prove the existence of f and q. To this end, we pick an integer n with
y ď 2n. Then we expand x´ 1 and y ´ 1 in the binary system using n digits and allowing
leading zeros. Say that this yields x´ 1 “ xn´1 . . . x1x0 and y´ 1 “ yn´1 . . . y1y0. Next we
compare these expansions from left to right and let xf´1 ‰ yf´1 be the ﬁrst place where
they diﬀer. Notice that x ă y entails xf´1 “ 0 and yf´1 “ 1. Finally we let q be the
number with binary representation q “ xn´1 . . . xf1.

So formally we have

x ´ 1 “ n´1ÿ

yi ¨ 2i ,
and xj “ yj for j P rf, n ´ 1s. Clearly, q is odd and

wherefore f and q are as desired.

The uniqueness of f and q may likewise be shown by studying the binary expansions

of x ´ 1 and y ´ 1. An alternative argument proceeds as follows:

Given x and y, let pf, qq and pf1, q1q be two pairs with the requested properties. Due
to symmetry we may suppose f ď f1. Now we have pq ´ 1q ¨ 2f´1 ă x ď q1 ¨ 2f1´1 and
consequently q ď q1 ¨ 2f1´f. Similarly q1 ¨ 2f1´1 ă y ď pq ` 1q2f´1 yields q1 ¨ 2f1´f ď q. The
combination of both estimates reveals q “ q1¨2f1´f but, since q is odd, this if only possible
if f “ f1 and q “ q1.
(cid:3)

We would like to point out that the uniqueness of f and q is several times going to be
essential in the arguments that follow. By redoing the above proof of this uniqueness more
carefully one can show the following monotonicity property of the function f.
Lemma 4.7. For any three positive integers x, y, and z such that x ă y ď z the inequality
fpx, yq ď fpx, zq holds.
Proof. For brevity we set f “ fpx, yq, q “ qpx, yq, f1 “ fpx, zq, and q1 “ qpx, zq. Arguing
indirectly we assume f1 ă f. Now pq1 ´ 1q ¨ 2f1´1 ă x ď q ¨ 2f´1 entails q1 ď q ¨ 2f´f1 and
similarly q ¨ 2f´1 ď y ď z ă pq1 ` 1q ¨ 2f1´1 leads to q ¨ 2f´f1 ď q1. Hence we must have
q1 “ q ¨ 2f´f1, contrary to the fact that q1 is odd.
(cid:3)

THE CHROMATIC NUMBER OF FINITE TYPE-GRAPHS

13

The following will be a standard argument later on.

Lemma 4.8. For any positive integers x ă y ď z and f with f “ fpx, yq “ fpx, zq we
have

pq ´ 1q ¨ 2f´1 ă x ď q ¨ 2f´1 ă y ď z ď pq ` 1q ¨ 2f´1 ,

where q “ qpx, yq “ qpx, zq.
Proof. Deﬁne q “ qpx, yq. Lemma 4.6 gives

pq ´ 1q ¨ 2f´1 ă x ď q ¨ 2f´1 ă y ď pq ` 1q ¨ 2f´1

and thus q ¨ 2f´1 is the least multiple of 2f´1 which is at least x. Due to f “ fpx, zq this
yields qpx, zq “ q and hence z ď pq ` 1q ¨ 2f´1.
(cid:3)

Next we record another property of f that shall be utilized later.

Lemma 4.9. If any four positive integers t, x, y, and z satisfy t ď x ă y ď z and
fpx, yq “ fpx, zq, then fpt, yq “ fpt, zq holds as well.
Proof. Setting f “ fpt, zq and q “ qpt, zq we get

pq ´ 1q ¨ 2f´1 ă t ď q ¨ 2f´1 ă z ď pq ` 1q ¨ 2f´1

from the deﬁnition of these quantities.

Of course the claim would easily follow from q ¨ 2f´1 ă y. So from now on we may

assume y ď q ¨ 2f´1 towards contradiction. This yields

pq ´ 1q ¨ 2f´1 ă t ď x ă y ď q ¨ 2f´1 ă z ď pq ` 1q ¨ 2f´1 ,

and in particular we obtain fpx, zq “ f but fpx, yq ‰ f, thus reaching a contradiction. (cid:3)
To conclude our dicussion of the auxiliary functions f and q we state how they interact

with the map η introduced in Fact 4.4.
Fact 4.10. For any integers x and y with 1 ď x ă y ď 2n we have

fpx, yq P rns ,

and

Again we leave the straightforward veriﬁcation to the reader. We may now return to

the problem of colouring the graphs Gbp2nq.

This accounts for the summand 2b ´ 6 on the right-hand side of our claim and we may

from Fact 4.4 constitutes an isomorphism between A and C, wherefore

(4.7)
The main idea for proving this is to split A into at most 22b´4 further sets, each of which
is either independent or has the property of being homomorphically mapped into Gb´1pnq
by a certain function ϕ that is to be introduced next. Observe that by the ﬁrst statement
from Fact 4.10 and by Lemma 4.7 there is a map ϕ: A ÝÑ Wb´1pnq deﬁned by

We call two vertices á

It is plain that equivalence is an equivalence relation and that the number of its equivalence

So let any two equivalent vertices á

connected by an edge of Gbp2nq, the notation for this being as in Deﬁnition 4.1. For any
i P r2b ´ 3s we set

x and á

αi “ fpx1, xi`2q

(4.9)
Notice that there is no misprint in the last formula – it is true that βi “ fpy1, yi`2q
holds as well, and actually this fact is very relevant to our main concern, but it will only
be shown at a rather late moment of our argument.

and βi “ fpx1, yi`2q .

Combining the assumption that tá
x,

yu be an edge of Gbp2nq with Lemma 4.7 we infer
á
(4.10)

α1 ď β1 ď α3 ď β3 ď . . . ď α2b´3 ď β2b´3

as well as

Next we would like to show

α2b´3 ă β2b´3 .

(4.11)

(4.12)

Assume contrariwise that α2b´3 “ β2b´3, i.e., fpá

xq “ fpx1, y2b´1q. Lemma 4.8 yields

xq ă x1 ď Tpá
T ´pá
so in combination with tá
yu being an edge and with á
á
x,

xq ă x2b´1 ă y2b´1 ď T `pá
xq ,

x P A we obtain

xq ă x1 ă y1 ď x2b´3 ď Tpá

xq ď x2b´1 ď y2b´2 ď y2b´1 ď T `pá
xq .
x „ á
xq. Using á

yq “ Tpá

xq and fpy1, y2b´2q “ fpy1, y2b´1q “ fpá

It follows that Tpá
y we may
deduce fpx1, x2b´2q “ fpx1, x2b´1q. Now Lemma 4.8 shows that qpx1, x2b´2q “ qpx1, x2b´1q
holds as well and consequently we have Tpá
xq ă x2b´2 ď y2b´3. Thus we get a contradiction
to á

y P A, whereby (4.12) is proved.
Extending this result we contend that more generally we have

αi ă βi

for all i P r2b ´ 3s .

(4.13)

Arguing indirectly again, we let i denote the largest counterexample to this claim. Notice
that (4.12) tells us i ď 2b ´ 4. Set q “ qpx1, xi`2q, T ´ “ pq ´ 1q ¨ 2αi´1, T “ q ¨ 2αi´1, and
T ` “ pq ` 1q ¨ 2αi´1. Due to Lemma 4.8 our indirect assumption αi “ βi entails

T ´ ă x1 ď T ă xi`2 ď yi`2 ď T ` ,

which together with xi`2 ď xi`3 ď yi`2 shows fpx1, xi`2q “ fpx1, xi`3q. Now á
y dis-
closes fpy1, yi`2q “ fpy1, yi`3q and by Lemma 4.9 it follows that fpx1, yi`2q “ fpx1, yi`3q.
Using Lemma 4.8 again we obtain

x „ á

T ´ ă x1 ď T ă xi`3 ď yi`3 ď T `

THE CHROMATIC NUMBER OF FINITE TYPE-GRAPHS

17
and thus αi`1 “ βi`1, contrary to the maximality of i. Thereby (4.13) is proved as well.
Now we are ready to conﬁrm the alternative deﬁnition of βi announced above. That is,

for any i P r2b ´ 3s we claim

(4.14)
To see this, set q “ qpx1, yi`2q, S´ “ pq ´ 1q¨ 2βi´1, S “ q ¨ 2βi´1, and S` “ pq ` 1q¨ 2βi´1.
Now

βi “ fpx1, yi`2q “ fpy1, yi`2q .

and x3 ă y3 ď yi`2. Hence S ă x3 would entail

S´ ă x1 ď S ă yi`2 ď S`

S´ ă x1 ď S ă x3 ď S`

and, consequently, α1 “ fpx1, x3q “ βi ě β1, which contradicts the case i “ 1 of (4.13).
This proves x1 ă y1 ď x3 ď S, which in turn establishes (4.14).

Putting everything together, the equations (4.9) and (4.14) yield

ϕpá

xq “ pα1, α2, . . . , α2b´3q

and

ϕpá

yq “ pβ1, β2, . . . , β2b´3q

and by (4.13) we may strengthen (4.10) to

α1 ă β1 ď α3 ă β3 ď . . . ď α2b´3 ă β2b´3 .

In particular this shows that ϕpá
yq are indeed vertices of Gb´1pnq and together
with (4.11) it further shows that these two vertices are adjacent. This concludes the proof
(cid:3)
of (4.8) and, hence, the proof of Proposition 4.11.

xq and ϕpá

Let us now summarize why all the work performed in this subsection demonstrates

Theorem 4.3.
Proof of Theorem 4.3. We argue by induction on b. The base cases b “ 1 and b “ 2 have
been dealt with in (4.1) and Lemma 4.5 respectively. In the light of Proposition 4.11 the
(cid:3)
induction step is easy.

Finally we would like to emphasize again that the combination of Proposition 3.1,

Theorem 4.2, and Theorem 4.3 implies Theorem 1.7.

§5. Reducible types

Having thus said everything we want to say about the chromatic number of irreducible
type-graphs, we devote the present section to the proof of Theorem 1.8. So we consider
any nontrivial type τ and let τ “ 12 ¨ . . . ¨ t be its factorization into irreducible types.
For each i P rts the number of blocks into which i decomposes is denoted by bi and we set
b˚ “ maxpb1, . . . , btq. Finally, let k be the width of τ and let i have width ki for i P rts.

Fact 5.1. For every i P rts and every integer n ě k there is a graph homomorphism

ϕi : Gpn, τq ÝÑ Gpn, iq .

Proof. Set r “ 1p1 ¨ . . .¨ i´1q and s “ 1p1 ¨ . . .¨ iq. Clearly i has width ki “ s´ r, and,
since 1, . . . , i are types, we also have r “ 2p1 ¨ . . . ¨ i´1q and s “ 2p1 ¨ . . . ¨ iq. Now it
