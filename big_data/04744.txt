Abstract

We have given a summary on our theoretical predictions of three kinds of topological semimet-

als (TSMs), namely, Dirac semimetal (DSM), Weyl semimetal (WSM) and Node-Line Semimetal

(NLSM). TSMs are new states of quantum matters, which are diﬀerent with topological insula-

tors. They are characterized by the topological stability of Fermi surface, whether it encloses band

crossing point, i.e., Dirac cone like energy node, or not. They are distinguished from each other

by the degeneracy and momentum space distribution of the nodal points. To realize these intrigu-

ing topological quantum states is quite challenging and crucial to both fundamental science and

future application. In 2012 and 2013, Na3Bi and Cd3As2 were theoretically predicted to be DSM,

respectively. Their experimental veriﬁcations in 2014 have ignited the hot and intensive studies

on TSMs. The following theoretical prediction of nonmagnetic WSM in TaAs family stimulated a

second wave and many experimental works have come out in this year. In 2014, a kind of three

dimensional crystal of carbon has been proposed to be NLSM due to negligible spin-orbit coupling

and coexistence of time-reversal and inversion symmetry. Though the ﬁnal experimental conﬁr-

mation of NLSM is still missing, there have been several theoretical proposals, including Cu3PdN

from us. In the ﬁnal part, we have summarized the whole family of TSMs and their relationship.

1. Introduction

Classiﬁcation of electronic states is one of the key concepts in condensed matter physics.

An usual way to classify the electronic states in solids is based on the symmetry principle,

by which most of the states as well as the transitions among them can be understood. For

example, the ferro-electric and ferro-magnetic states can be understood as states that break

the spacial inversion and time reversal symmetries, respectively. The Landau theory for

phase transitions is very successful in condensed matter physics, which is built entirely on

the symmetry principle. In the recent thirty years, another way to classify condensed matter

systems has been developed through a completely diﬀerent point of view, i.e. topology. The

ﬁrst type of systems which can be classiﬁed by its topological features is the 2D electron

gas under high magnetic ﬁeld. Once there are integer number of Landau levels being fully

2

occupied, the system is in n-th integer quantum Hall state (IQHS) with quantized Hall

conductance.1 Further analysis of IQHS by TKNN revealed that the IQHS has very deep

topological origin.2,3 Although diﬀerent IQHS are the same in terms of symmetry, they

can be characterized by diﬀerent integers (TKNN number or Chern number), which can

be expressed by the integral of the Berry’s curvature over the whole magnetic Brillouin

zone (BZ).2 This integer number is called topological invariance, which can not be changed

without closing the energy gap of the system.

After the discovery of IQHS, it was anticipated that the concept of topological electronic

states should not be limited only to 2DEG under external magnetic ﬁeld4. The idea ought to

be generalized to the realistic materials as well. In about ten years ago, the idea of ﬁnding

electronic states that can be classiﬁed by topological invariance in solid state materials

has been realized in a class of band insulators, topological insulator.5–8 Similar with the

IQHS, the TI can be characterized by topological invariances or indices but the diﬀerence

is that these indices, called Z2 indices, can only take two possible value, even or odd.

The TI, characterized by odd Z2 indices, has unique Dirac like surface (or edge) states,

which is unavoidable as long as the time reversal symmetry is preserved. The ﬁrst TI

proposed by theorists is graphene9, while due to its extremely small energy gap (about
10−3 meV) opened by spin-orbit coupling,10 it hard to observe any physical properties of
TI in graphene. The prediction of TI state in HgTe/CdTe quantum well was made by

the Stanford group11 and had been conﬁrmed experimentally a year after.12 The discovery

of 3D TI Bi2Se3 family13–15 makes it much easier to study all kinds of properties of TI
including the transport under magnetic ﬁeld, thermal electric properties16,17 as well as the

possible topological superconductor phase induced by proximate eﬀect.18–20 With Doping of

the magnetic elements into the Bi2Te3 family thin ﬁlms, another long awaited topological

phase, quantum anomalous Hall state (QAHE)4,21–23, has been theoretically predicted24 and

experimentally observed.25 The QAHE can be viewed as a kind of IQHS without Landau

Levels (no external magnetic ﬁeld).23

With the successful discovery of those topological insulating states, it is nature to ask

wether or not metals can be classiﬁed by topological invariances as well. Although till

now the general topological classiﬁcation for metals is still unclear, we now have ways to

classify a special type of metals, the semimetals, where the zero energy contour in energy

dispersion or Fermi surface contains only isolated points (or lines for 3D systems) rather

3

than surfaces. These Fermi nodes (or nodal lines) are caused by the band crossing points

(also called as nodes or nodal points) right at the Fermi level. The semimetal can be viewed

as the special type of “insulator” as well, where the energy gap only closes at those isolated

k-points or lines. In 2D systems, graphene can be viewed as the ﬁrst well studied topological

semimetal (TSM), where the low energy physics can be well described by the 2D massless

Dirac equation. The line integral of the Berry connection along any closed loops in the BZ

will accumulate a phase π (0) if the loop (doesn’t) encloses the Dirac point and this phase

can be used as the topological invariance, which manifests itself in the unique Landau level

structure under magnetic ﬁeld. While as we will introduce below, similar to graphene the

band crossing points can also occur in 3D materials. Although the band crossings in 3D and

2D do share some similarities, it is indeed very diﬀerent. The most essential diﬀerence comes

from the factor that without extra degeneracy, i.e. the spin degeneracy for fermions, the band

crossings in 3D can only be shifted but not removed by small perturbations in Hamiltonian.

While in comparison, the band crossing points in 2D is caused by crystalline symmetry on

some special k-points in the BZ and will disappear immediately once a small perturbation

is added to break that symmetry. Therefore in 3D, the crossing points between two non-

degenerate bands can be viewed as “topological defects”, which are the stable objects like

the vortices in the ﬂuid. Such crossing points are called Weyl points (Weyl nodes) because

the low energy physics around them can be well described by the Weyl equation, which is

well known in particle physics and contains only half of the freedom of the Dirac equation.26

Weyl nodes in crystalline solids were ﬁrst studied as magnetic monopoles in momentum

space in the context of anomalous Hall eﬀect27 As will be illustrated in detail below, Weyl

points have chirality deﬁned as the sign of the determinant for the velocity tensor, which is

another unique point in 3D. It has been proved mathematically that Weyl points generated

in any lattice model can only come in pairs with opposite chirality.28–30 In fact, the only

way to remove Weyl points is to move a pair of Weyl points with opposite chirality to a

same k point and annihilate them. The most important eﬀect generated by these “chiral

electrons” is so called “chiral anomaly” describing the adiabatic electron pumping caused

by the joint eﬀect of the external magnetic and electric ﬁelds between Weyl points with

opposite chirality.31 The chiral anomaly (or ABJ anomaly) will generate current along the

direction of the magnetic ﬁeld leading to negative magneto resistance when the magnetic

and electric ﬁelds are parallel to each other.32,33 Besides the negative MR, chiral anomaly

4

can also generate more eﬀects in transport34 and optical properties,35–38 as well as the chiral

magnetic eﬀect39,40, nonlocal transport,41 and chiral gauge anomaly.42

The nodal point behaves like the magnetic monopole in crystal momentum space, being

a “source” or “sink” of Berry curvature, the ﬁeld of Berry ﬂux.23,27,43 Fig. 1 shows the

typical band structure and the topological relationship between Fermi surface (with Fermi

level slightly oﬀ the node) and magnetic monopoles. The Dirac semimetal (DSM) has its

Fermi surface encloses two monopoles with opposite topological charge “kissing” at the same

k-point, while WSM always has opposite monopoles in pair and they are well separated.30

Node-Line semimetal (NLSM) is a special case with nodal points forming a periodically

continuous line or closed ring in the momentum space. After a loop of adiabatic evolution

along a closed path interlocked with the nodal ring, eigenstates on one of the crossing bands

will acquire a Berry phase of π, which stabilize its ring like Fermi surface. Therefore, these

three kinds of TSM can be identiﬁed by the degeneracy and distribution of nodal points.

These exotic nontrivial TSMs are expected to have intriguing quantum phenomena and

physical properties. Their realistic material realization become very important and crucial

to bring them into the realm of experimental study and potential application in future.

As we have pointed out in Ref. 44, the quick development of ﬁrst-principles calculation

methods and software packages, together with the intrinsic robustness of band topology

immune to perturbation and numerical error, ensure the predictive power of the stat-of-art

ﬁrst-principles calculation for the topological materials. The remarkable successful stories

include the 2D TIs11,12, 3D TIs13–15, Chern insulators supporting quantum anomalous Hall

eﬀect24,25, 3D topological crystalline insulators45,46 and so on. In this topical review, we will

brieﬂy summarize our theoretical material proposals for three types of TSMs, namely DSM,

WSM and NLSM. Some of them have been conﬁrmed by experimental observations after

our predictions. Experimentally, the most direct and eﬃcient way to observe the TSMs is to

use the angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) technique, which can detect the

band structure and even its spin polarization. There are basically three important hallmarks

of TSMs to be observed by ARPES, including the 3D Dirac/Weyl points, the Fermi arcs on

the surface47 and the spin texture of Fermi arcs.

Here m represents the mass term and couples the two massless Weyl fermions described
by ±σ · k with opposite chirality.26,49,50 If m is ﬁnite, this equation describes the massive
Dirac fermion as shown in Fig. 1 assuming the Fermi level inside of the gap. If m is zero,

it describes the massless Dirac fermion composed by two massless Weyl nodes overlapping

each other. If Fermi level is slightly shifted oﬀ the Dirac node, the Fermi surface encloses

a pair of Weyl nodes. The number of pairs can be looked as a topological invariance to

identify DSM.

In a general band inversion mechanism as shown in Fig. 2, the band inversion between

two spin degenerate bands can cause four-fold degenerate energy nodal points. However,

in general situation as discussed by S. Murakami,51,52 including SOC will open a band

gap at the four-fold degenerate band crossing points. This leads to insulating state and

most probably the system becomes a TI, or a topological crystalline insulator, or any other

insulator. However, we think such band gap opening is not inevitable and it can be well

protected by some crystal symmetry as long as the two spin degenerate bands belong to two

diﬀerent 2D irreducible representations of the little group at the k-point where the band

crossing happens. Therefore, the candidate of DSM must have at least two diﬀerent 2D

irreducible representations in its double space group. This is a necessary condition but not

enough one. This ﬁnding is very crucial and it directly guides the theoretical prediction of

DSM in Na3Bi53 and Cd3As2.54

2.1: Na3Bi

In 2012, present authors and their collaborators predicted that DSM might be realized in

some hexagonal phase of alkali pnictides A3B (A=Alkali metal, B=As, Sb or Bi) represented
by Na3Bi.53 Its crystal structure is shown in Fig. 3. There are two nonequivalent Na sites,

Na(1) and Na(2), in one unit cell. Na(1) and Bi form simple honeycomb lattice layers

stacking along the c-axis. Na(2) atoms are inserted at the interlayer position, connecting

these layers on top of Bi atoms. From the ionic picture, due to the closed-shell conﬁguration
where the number of valence electrons (3×Na-s1+Bi-p3) is equal to 6, one may expect Na3Bi
is a semiconductor, similar to Na3Sb55. However, the electronegativity of Bi is weaker than

Sb, which makes Na3Bi be DSM rather semiconductor like Na3Sb.

The calculated band structures of Na3Bi are shown in Fig. 4. They suggest that the

valence and conduction bands are dominated by Bi-6p and Na-3s states. Around the Fermi

level, the top valence band is mostly from Bi-6px,y states and the lowest conduction band is

mostly from Na(1)-3s orbital. These features are similar to those of Na3Sb55 except that in

Na3Bi, the Na-3s band is lower than Bi-6px,y by about 0.3 eV at Γ, and this value is enhanced

to be 0.7 eV in the presence of SOC. This is a typical picture of band inversion44 but absent

in Na3Sb. The band inversion is due to the heavier Bi, which has higher 6p-states and larger

SOC compared to Sb. Since GGA usually underestimates the band gap and results in the

overestimation of band inversion, the band inversion is further conﬁrmed by the calculation

using hybrid functional HSE56,57. The band inversion persisted and Na-3s band is around

0.5 eV lower than Bi-6p ones. K3Bi and Rb3Bi have the similar band structure and band

topology with band inversion around 0.33 eV and 0.42 eV, respectively.

Diﬀerent from topological insulators such as Bi2Te3 and Bi2Se3,13,58 Na3Bi is a semimetal

with two nodes (band-crossings) exactly at Fermi level as shown in Fig. 4. Its Fermi surface

consists of two isolated Fermi points, which are located at (0, 0, kc

c ) along the
Γ-A line. Around each node, the band dispersions is linear, resulting in a 3D Dirac cone.

1% compression along y axis will open up a gap ≈5.6 meV. This insulating state, however,
is topologically non-trivial with Z2=17,8 due to the inverted band structure around the Γ

point. This fact leads to coexistence of both bulk 3D Dirac cone and topological surface

states (a single pair) as long as the crystal symmetry protecting band crossings stands. As

shown in Fig. 5(a), the solid Dirac cone is from the projection of bulk 3D Dirac cone onto

[001]-surface overlapped with the topological surface states. Such distinguished property of

DSM is more obvious if inspecting its side surface on which two Dirac cones are projected

at two diﬀerent points. As shown in Fig. 5(b), the solid Dirac cone from bulk states is well

separated from the topological surface Dirac cone. While the surface states merge into the

bulk states at the Dirac points where bulk band gap closes. Thus, if Fermi level passes

through the bulk Dirac nodes, the surface Fermi surface has Fermi arc structures as shown

in Fig. 5(c).

ill deﬁned at the two singular points (corresponding to the projection of bulk Dirac points to

the surface). The spin texture of surface states has helical structure, quite similar to that of

topological insulators, but the magnitude of spin vector vanishes at the singular points. This

kind of Fermi surfaces has never been found before, and it can be understood following the
discussions for Weyl semimetal.47,59 If the 4×4 Dirac point is split into two separated 2×2
Weyl points in momentum space by breaking time reversal or inversion symmetry60,61, the

Fermi surface of surface states will also split into open segments which are Fermi arcs dis-

cussed in Weyl semimetal. In Fig. 5(d), an exchange ﬁeld breaking time-reversal symmetry

separates the touch of two Fermi arcs.

All these characters in contrast to conventional metals and topological insulators have

been be experimentally conﬁrmed by successive ARPES measurements.62–64 The extraor-

dinary magneto transport property in DSM Na3Bi due to chiral anomaly has also been

conﬁrmed experimentally.65–67

2.2: Cd3As2

After the theoretical prediction of DMS in Na3Bi, the experimental works to conﬁrm

it have been intensively performed.

It is soon found to be unstable in air. Therefore,

the present authors and their collaborators were motivated to ﬁnd other better materials

to be more suitable for experimental studies. The well known compound Cd3As2 was re-

investigated and was found to be another DSM candidate in 2013.54 Similarly, it has a single

pair of Dirac points in bulk and Fermi arcs on proper surface. In particular, in one of its

phase the spin degeneracy of crossing bands is lifted away from the Dirac points, in star

contrast to other examples53,68. It is further suggested that its quantum well structure can

naturally support the quantum spin Hall (QSH) eﬀect. The other nice aspect of Cd3As2 is
its high carrier mobility up to 15000 cm2V−1s−1 at room temperature and 80000 cm2V−1s−1
at 4 K, reported about 50 years ago69. These advantages make it a promising candidate for

future experimental studies and potential applications.

The crystal structure of Cd3As2 is complicated. In Fig. 6, there are hypothetical anti-

ﬂuorite Cd8As4 and zinc blende Cd4As4. The Cd6As4 is obtained with two diagonal sites of

Cd vacancy in Cd8As4. This is the basic building block of real Cd3As2 crystal structure. If

the arrangement of building block is random, i.e., the distribution of these vacancies is ran-

dom, one may treat it by virtual crystal approximation (VCA) for simplicity70,71. However,

is correction73 to the crystal structure after our original work published. This vacancy or-

dering and very large uint cell of Cd3As2 has brings serious problems for theoretical studies

in history, and there has been no ﬁrst-principles calculation before Ref. 54.

Cd3As2 belongs to the II3-V2-types narrow gap semiconductor family.69 It has drawn a lot
attention since it has been believed to have inverted band structure,74–77 whereas all others

Cd3P2, Zn3As2 and Zn3P2 have normal band ordering. In contrast to other inverted band

compounds (like HgTe, HgSe, and α-Sn), Cd3As2 belongs to tetragonal symmetry, and is
the representative of this group, which has the splitted valence band top at (cid:126)k=0.

Similar to most of the semiconductors with anti-ﬂuorite or zinc-blende structures, the

low energy electronic properties of Cd3As2 are mostly determined by the Cd-5s states (con-

duction bands) and the As-4p states (valence bands), as shown in Fig. 7. However, there are

two distinct features: (1) band-inversion around Γ with the s-band (red solid cycle) lower

than the p ones, which is an important sign of non-trivial topology; (2) it is semimetallic

with band crossings along the Γ-Z path. This band-crossing is unavoidable since the two

bands belong to diﬀerent (Λ6 and Λ7) representations respectively, as distinguished by C4

rotational symmetry around kz axis. The diﬀerent representation prohibits hybridization

between them, resulting in the protected band-crossing. The crossing points locate exactly

at the Fermi level due to charge neutrality requirement and the Fermi surface has only a

single pair of Dirac points (two symmetric points along Γ-Z related by TR). Structure I and

II share these common features with small but remarkably diﬀerence as will be addressed in

As had been attempted with perturbation method78, vacancy ordering and BZ folding

play important role for the band-inversion, in contrast to the cases of HgTe or Ag2Te79, where

it was driven by the the shallow d states. To prove this, Cd3As2 with hypothetic anti-ﬂuorite

structure without vacancy in Fig. 6(a) has been calculated by using VCA method, compared

with the usual ﬁrst-principles calculation for Cd3As2 in the same anti-ﬂurite structure but

with Cd vacancy in Fig. 6(b). It is found that the VCA calculation gives out normal band

ordering at Γ but the one with Cd vacancy results in inverted band ordering. At the BZ

boundary X point of the hypothetic anti-ﬂuorite structure without Cd vacancy, there exists

shallow s and p states, which will be folded to Γ in realistic structure with Cd vacancy

ordering. Therefore, the hybridization among the states with the same representation will

push them away from each other, i.e, make the lowest s-state even lower and highest p-state

higher, resulting in the robust band inversion at Γ. The band-inversion calculated from the

generalized gradient approximation (GGA) is about 0.7 eV for both structure I and II. The

possible underestimation of the s-p gap within GGA is improved by the calculations with

HSE method.56,57 The band-inversion around 0.3 eV is obtained, being consistent with most

of the existing experimental evidence, such as the optical and transport measurements.74,75

The inverted band structure discussed above suggests that Cd3As2 is topologically non-

trivial. However, due to the four-fold rotational symmetry, it is in fact a 3D DSM with a

pair of 3D Dirac points at the Fermi level. This is slight diﬀerent from Na3Bi. Similarly, if

the four-fold rotational symmetry is broken, two Weyl fermions with opposite chirality will

be annihilate each other, resulting in a massive Dirac fermions with ﬁnite band gap. The

resulting insulator is a strong TI.

Similar as Na3Bi, Cd3As2 has coexistence of bulk and surface Dirac cone in its surface

state. The semi-inﬁnite (001) and (110) surfaces of the structure II Cd3As2 are presented

in Fig. 8. For (001) surface, the surface projection of continuous bulk states superposes

the non-trivial surface states. The Fermi surface of this surface is just a point as shown

in Fig. 8(b). For (110) surface, the non-trivial surface states are clear. The Fermi surface

of such topological surface states has two half-circle Fermi arcs touching at the singularity

points where the surface projection of bulk Dirac points exists.

It is noted that structure II has no inversion symmetry and no Kramer degeneracy at

general momenta. As shown in Fig. 9, the bulk Dirac cone in structure II has spin splitting

spin polarized bulk Dirac cone is quite similar to the Weyl cone in WSM of TaAs family.

Soon after this theoretical prediction, the present authors and their collaborators have

observed the 3D bulk Dirac cone80,81 and surface states82 in Cd3As3 through ARPES mea-

surement. Other experimental works include Ref. 83–87.

B. Yang and N. Nagaosa have classiﬁed Na3Bi and Cd3As2 as DSM carrying quantized

topological invariant,88 while BiO2

68 and distorted spinel89 as the class having only a single

Dirac point at a time-reversal invariant momentum. The classiﬁcation of DSM is further

investigated by Gibson et al.90 and several similar DSM candidates have also been proposed

by Du et al.91 As originally pointed out by S. Murakami,51,52, DSM can also be obtained at

the topological phase transition point for IS conserved system. Bi1−xSbx

92,93 is believed to

be DSM at the phase transition point from TI to normal insulator. We have proposed that

ZrTe5 and HfTe5 are DSM only at the phase transition point from weak to strong TI.40,94–96

3. Weyl Semimetal

As discussed before, DSM has Dirac nodes composed by two opposite chiral Weyl nodes

“kiss” at the same k-point due to the degeneracy in spin degree of freedom. In condensed

matters, such spin degeneracy at general k-point is usually protected by coexistence of time-

reversal symmetry (TRS) and inversion (IS). It is known as Kramer degeneracy. Breaking

either TRS or IS might result in two-fold degenerate Weyl nodes. This leads to two types of

WSM, i.e., the magnetic WSM and nonmagnetic noncentrosymmetric WSM. The ﬁrst WSM

was proposed to be in pyrochlore iridates with all-in/all-out magnetic ordering by X. Wan

et al.47 In the same year, our collaborators and us59 proposed that ferromagnetic half-metal

HgCr2Se4 might be a WSM with pair of Weyl nodes having topological charge of 2, so called

double WSM.97 However, the magnetic WSM suﬀers from the complex domain structure in

ARPES measurement. There is still no material deﬁnitely conﬁrmed to be magnetic WSM

up to now. Finding a nonmagnetic WSM is thus very important. In this section, we will

introduce our theoretical predictions of FM HgCr2Se4 and noncentrosymmetric nonmagnetic

TaAs family. The recent progress in nonmagnetic WSM is the proposal of type-II WSM98

in WTe2.99

3.1: Magnetic Weyl Semimetal: HgCr2Se4

In 2011, it was proposed that a spinel structural compound HgCr2Se4 might be a WSM
under its ground state. Compared with the former proposal of WSM47, HgCr2Se4 has only

16

one pair of Weyl cones around Fermi level and each Weyl cone has topological charge of

2. HgCr2Se4 has quite simple ferromagnetic (FM) ordering and robust against choice of

on-site Coulmb interaction parameter U . Before WSM state was proposed in it, HgCr2Se4

was known as a FM spinel exhibiting large coupling eﬀects between electronic and mag-

netic properties100.

It shows quite interesting properties like giant magnetoresistance101,

anomalous Hall eﬀect102, and red shift of optical absorption edge103. Its experimental Curie
temperature Tc is high (around 106∼120 K), and the saturated moment is around 5.64
µB/f.u.104,105, approaching the atomic value expected for high-spin Cr3+. Its transport be-

havior is diﬀerent from other FM chalcogenide spinels, like CdCr2Se4 and CdCr2S4 which are

clearly semiconducting. HgCr2Se4 exhibits semiconducting character in the paramagnetic

state but metallic in the low temperature FM phase101,106,107.

The spinel structure, with space group Fd¯3m, can be related to the zinc blende and/or

diamond structures. As shown in Fig. 10, taking Cr2Se4 cluster as a single pseudo-atom

(called X) located at the center of mass, HgX becomes a typical zinc blende structure. The

pseudo atom X is actually a small cube formed by 4 Cr atoms and 4 Se atoms located at the

cube corners alternatively. The cubes are connected by sharing the Cr atoms at the corner.

As the result, each Cr atom is octahedrally coordinated by 6 nearest Se atoms. There are

two HgX formula unit (f.u.)

in each unit cell, and they are connected by the inversion

symmetry similar to the two atoms in the diamond structure.

The ﬁrst-principles calculation conﬁrms that FM solution is considerably more stable

than non-magnetic solution by about 2.8eV/f.u. lower in totoal energy. The obtained mag-

netic moment (6.0 µB/f.u.) agrees with experimental value104,105 very well. The electronic

structures shown in Fig. 11 (a) and (b) suggest that it can be approximately characterized as

a “zero-gap half-metal” in the case without spin-orbit coupling (SOC). It is zero-gap because

there is band touching around Γ at Fermi level in spin down channel; it is half-metal since

there band gap in the up-spin channel. The 3d-states of Cr3+ are in the conﬁguration of
t3↑
2ge0↑
g manifolds. The
Se-4p states are from -6 to 0 eV, being fully occupied and contribute to the valence band

g . The band gap is due to crystal ﬁeld splitting of the t3↑

2g and e0↑

g t0↓

maxima dominantly. By hybridizing with Cr-3d states, Se-4p are slightly spin-polarized

but with opposite moment (about -0.08 µB/Se) to that on Cr. The zero-gap behavior in

spin down channel is the most important character. It suggests the inverted band structure

around Γ, which is similar to the case in HgSe or HgTe108,109.

in HgSe or HgTe. The only diﬀerence is the presence of exchange splitting in HgCr2Se4.
The band inversion, |S,↓(cid:105) being lower than |P,↓(cid:105) at Γ as shown in Fig. 11(c), is due to the
following two factors. Firstly, the Hg-5d states are very shallow (located at about -7.0 eV

in Fig. 11(a)) and its hybridization with Se-4p states pushes the antibonding Se-4p states
higher, similar to that in HgSe. Secondly, the hybridization between unoccupied Cr-3d↓ and
Hg-6s↓ states in the down spin channel pushes the Hg-6s↓ state lower in energy (Fig. 11 (b)
and (c)). Therefore, the |S,↓(cid:105) is about 0.4eV lower than |P,↓(cid:105) states at Γ, and it is further
enhanced to be 0.55eV in the presence of SOC. It is important to check the correlation

eﬀect beyond GGA. It has been shown that semiconducting CdCr2S4 and CdCr2Se4 can be

well described by the LDA+U calculations with eﬀective U around 3.0 eV110,111. The same

LDA+U calculations for HgCr2Se4 show that the band-inversion remains unless the U is

unreasonably large (> 8.0 eV).

crossing-B is a closed loop surrounding Γ point in the kz=0 plane, as schematically shown in
Fig. 12(a). For the 2D planes with ﬁxed-kz (kz (cid:54)= 0 and kz (cid:54)= ±kc
z), the band structures are
all gapped in the sense that a curved Fermi level is deﬁned. Thus, the Chern number C for
each kz-ﬁxed plane can be evaluated. It is found that C = 0 for the planes with kz < −kc
z and kz (cid:54)= 0. The crossing-A

points locate at the phase boundary between C = 2 and C = 0 planes, i.e. kz = ±kc

crossing-B points forming the closed loop in kz = 0 plane are just accidental and it is due

to the presence of crystal mirror symmetry with respect to the kz=0 plane. The crossing-B

is not as stable as crossing-A in the sense that it can be changed by changing of the crystal

symmetry. This node-line becomes a hot topic recently as we will discuss in the next section.

exists. The in-plane band dispersions near the Weyl nodes at kz = ±kc

than linear, with a phase of 4π for the chiral spin texture as shown in Fig. 12(c). The two
Weyl nodes located at ±kc

monopoles carrying gauge ﬂux in (cid:126)k-space as shown in Fig. 12(d). The band-crossing loop

This Chern semi-metal state realized in HgCr2Se4 will lead to novel physical consequences,

which can be measured experimentally. The 8-bands Kane model ﬁtted from ﬁrst-principles

calculations is used for the numerical demonstration. First, each kz-ﬁxed plane with non-zero

Chern number can be regarded as a 2D Chern insulator, and there must be chiral edge states
for such plane if an edge is created. By Replacing kx with −i∂x and using open boundary
condition along x (or y) direction, one can obtain the edge states for each ﬁxed-kz. The

number of edge states is two for the case of C=2 as shown in Fig. 13(a), or zero for the case

of C=0. If the chemical potential is located within the gap, only the chiral edge states can

contribute to the Fermi surface, which are isolated points for each Chern insulating plane

but nothing for the plane with C=0. Therefore the trajectory of such points in the (kx, kz)

surface or (ky, kz) surface form non-closed fermi arcs, which can be measured by ARPES as

shown in Fig. 13 (b). This is very much diﬀerent from the conventional metals, where the

Fermi surfaces must be either closed or interrupted by the Brillouin zone boundary. The

possible Fermi arcs has been recently discussed from a view point of accidental degeneracy

for pyrochlore iridates47. In general, any magnetic system with band-crossing nodes at Fermi

level may show Fermi arcs on its surface. As demonstrate in Fig. 13, the calculated Fermi
arcs for HgCr2Se4 not only end at kz=±kc
z, but also are interrupted by the kz=0 plane,
where the Node-line exists. Nevertheless, for WSM the Fermi arcs should be stable because

the Weyl nodes are topologically unavoidable.

The QAHE, however, is an unique physical consequence characterizing the WSM nature

in ferromagnetic HgCr2Se4 quantum-well structure.23 For 2D band insulators, the transverse

h , where C is the Chern number. Such a
quantum Hall eﬀect without magnetic ﬁeld has been long-pursued,4,21,23,24 but only achieved

experimentally in 2013 in magnetic ion doped topological insulator ﬁlms as theoretically

predicted in 2010.23–25 In HgCr2Se4, considering the kz-ﬁxed planes, the Chern number C

is non-zero for limited regions of kz due to the band inversion around Γ as discussed above.

In the quantum well structure, the low energy states around Γ are quantized into subbands,
with |Hn(cid:105) and |En(cid:105) for hole and electron subbands, respectively. All the subbands’ energy
level change as function of ﬁlm thickness. As shown in Fig. 14, when the thickness of the

ﬁlm is very thin the band inversion in the bulk band structure will be removed entirely

by the ﬁnite size eﬀect. With the increment of the thickness, the band inversion among

these subbands restores, which results in jumps in the Chern number or the Hall coeﬃcient
22,23. As shown in Fig. 14(b), the critical thickness of the ﬁlm is around 21˚A. The

σxy
subsequent jumps of σxy is in unit of 2e2/h due to the change of 2 in Chern number. This

brings an interesting way to realize high plateau quantum Hall conductivity of 2 in QAHE,

being distinguished from present experimentally achievable magnetic doped TI system.23 In

fact, the strong anomalous Hall eﬀect has been observed for the bulk samples of HgCr2Se4

102.

This is in sharp contrast to pyrochlore iridates, where the anomalous Hall eﬀect should be

vanishing due to the AF ordering.

Inspired by this theoretical proposal, recent detailed transport studies have revealed that

the ground state of HgCr2Se4 has nearly full spin-polarized current in its s-orbital conduction

band, which is a strong evidence for its half-metallicity.113

3. 2: Non-magnetic Weyl Semimetal: TaAs family

In addition to the two magnetic WSMs, namely pyrochlore iridate Rn2Ir2O7

47 and spinel

HgCr2Se4

59 introduced above, other proposals involve a ﬁne-tuned multilayer structure com-

posed of normal insulator and magnetically doped TIs60 or just magnetic ion doped TIs.114

All of them involve magnetic compounds and the spin degeneracy of the bands is removed by

breaking time reversal symmetry. However, these proposals are still waiting for experimental

conﬁrmation.

As mentioned above, WSM can also be generated by breaking the spatial inversion sym-

metry only but keeping time-reversal symmetry. This is the nonmagnetic and noncentrosym-

metric WSM. Compared with the magnetic WSM, nonmagnetic WSM has the following

advantages. 1) it can be more easily studied by ARPES measurement since the alignment of

23

magnetic domains is not required; 2) without the spin exchange ﬁeld, the unique structure of

Berry curvature related with magnetic monopoles leads to very unusual transport properties

under external magnetic ﬁeld. Such properties are not mixed by the self-magnetization of

the magnetic sample.

There have been several proposals for WSM in system without inversion symmetry, such

as a superlattice composed of alternatively stacking normal and topological insulators,60,115

elemental Tellurium or Selenium crystal under proper pressure,116 the ﬁne-tuned solid solu-

tion of ABi1−xSbxTe3 (A=La and Lu)117 around the topological transition points.51,52 There

is none of the above has been realized experimentally due to the following possible problems:

1) very ﬁne control, such as quantum well thickness and doping concentration, is required

in sample preparation; 2) applying pressure makes the other measurement very diﬃcult.

In the end of 2014, our collaborators and us have posted the theoretical prediction that

TaAs,TaP, NbAs and NbP single crystals are natural WSM and possess 12 pairs of Weyl

points.118 Compared with the other proposals, this family of materials are completely stoi-

chiometric without any additional doping, external strain or pressure. High quality sample

can be easily obtained and experimental veriﬁcation becomes quite easier.

Unlike in the case of pyrochlore iridates and HgCr2Se4, inversion symmetry is kept and

the appearance of Weyl points can be immediately inferred from the product of the parities

at all the time reversal invariant momenta (TRIM).119–121 For the TaAs family, parity is

no longer a good quantum number. It is found that the appearance of Weyl points can be

inferred by analyzing the mirror Chern numbers (MCN)46,122 and Z2 indices5,119,123,124 for the

four mirror and time reversal invariant planes in the BZ. Similar as many other topological

materials, the WSM phase in this family is also induced by band inversion, which, in the

absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), leads to nodal rings in the mirror plane. Once SOC is

turned on, each nodal ring will be gapped with the exception of three pairs of Weyl points,

which lead to fascinating physical properties including the complicated Fermi arc structures

on surface.

The experimental crystal structure of TaAs125 is shown in Fig. 15. It has body-centered-

tetragonal structure with nonsymmorphic space group I41md (No. 109) lacking inversion
symmetry. The measured lattice constants are a=b=3.4348 ˚A and c=11.641 ˚A. Both Ta

and As are at 4a Wyckoﬀ position (0, 0, u) with u=0 and 0.417 for Ta and As, respectively.

To calculate the topological invariant such as MCN and surface states of TaAs, we have

generated atomic-like Wannier functions for Ta 5d and As 4p orbitals using the scheme

described in Ref. 126

The band structure of TaAs within GGA without including SOC is shown in Fig. 15(c).

There is clear band inversion and multiple band crossing features near the Fermi level along

ZN, ZS and ΣS paths. In Fig.15(b), the shadowed planes are two mirror planes, namely

Mx, My, while the dashed lines indicate two glide mirror planes, namely Mxy, M−xy. The

plane spanned by Z, N and Γ points is invariant under mirror My and the energy bands
within the plane can be labeled by mirror eigenvalues ±1. Further analysis shows that the
two bands that cross the Z to N line belong to opposite mirror eigenvalues and hence the

crossing between them is protected by mirror symmetry. Similar band crossings can also be

these band crossing points form a “nodal ring” in the ZNΓ plane as shown in Fig.16(b).

Unlike for the situation in ZNΓ plane, in the two glide mirror planes (Mxy and M−xy), the

band structure is fully gaped with the minimum gap around 0.5 eV.

The bands near the Fermi energy are mainly formed by Ta 5d orbitals, which have quite

strong SOC. SOC brings dramatic changes in the band structure near Fermi level, as plotted

in Fig. 15(d). It seems that the previous band crossings on the nodal rings in ZNΓ plane

are all gaped. Detailed symmetry analysis reveals that the bands “2” and “3” in Fig.15(d)

belong to opposite mirror eigenvalues, indicating the almost touching point along the ZN

line is completely accidental. In fact there is a small gap of roughly 3 meV between bands

“2” and “3” as illustrated by the inset of Fig.15(d). Therefore, the ZNΓ plane becomes fully

gapped with SOC included.

There are three critical questions to be addressed to convincingly identify TaAs as a WSM.

1) Do Weyl nodes really exist? 2) How many of them? 3) Where are they? Since Weyl nodes

are at general k-points with accidental double degenerate eigen energy, numerical method

always has error due to discrete sampling of 3D momentum space. No matter how dense

the sampling grid is used, ﬁnite numerical error exists and brings diﬃculty in identifying

the existence of massless Dirac cone like band structure. Some eﬃcient way mathematically

rigorous is necessary to make ﬁnal conclusion.

Since TaAs has no inversion center, the widely used and most simpliﬁed parity conﬁgura-

tion method119–121,124 can not be applied to identify the existence of WSM. Another strategy

is thus developed in Ref. 118. As previously mentioned, the space group of the material pro-

vides two mirror planes (Mx and My), where MCN can be deﬁned. If a full gap exists for the

entire BZ, the MCN would directly reveal whether this system is a topological crystalline

insulator45 or not. Interestingly, if the system is not fully gaped MCN is still useful to ﬁnd

out whether the material hosts Weyl points in the BZ or not. Besides the two mirror planes,

there are two additional glide mirror plane (Mxy and M−xy). MCN is not well deﬁned for

the glide mirror planes, but Z2 index is still well deﬁned here since these two planes are

time reversal invariant and electronic states inside of them are insulator. The Wilson loop

method44,127 is applied to calculate the MCNs for the two mirror planes and Z2 indices for

the two glide mirror planes. To determine the MCNs for the mirror plane Mx, Wilson loops

along kx direction with ﬁxed kz are deﬁned. All the occupied bands at k-points in this plane

non-trivial helical edge modes due to non-zero MCN in ZNΓ plane, which generates a single

27

pair of FS cuts along the projective line of the ZNΓ plane, i.e. the x- or y-axis in Fig. 16(c).

Whether these Fermi cuts will eventually form a single closed Fermi circle or not depends on

the Z2 index for the two glide mirror plane, which are projected to the dashed blue lines in

Fig. 16(c). Since the Z2 indices for the glide mirror planes are trivial, there are no protected

helical edge modes along the projective lines of the glide mirror planes, the dashed blue

lines in Fig. 16(c), and the Fermi level cuts along the x- or y-axis in Fig. 16(c) must end
somewhere between the x- or y− axis and the diagonal lines. That means they must be
Fermi arcs, ending at the surface projection of Weyl points in the bulk band structure of

TaAs.

The existence of Weyl points is conﬁrmed. The left questions are the total number and

the exact positions of them. As mentioned above, this is a hard task since the Weyl points

are located at generic k points without any symmetry. For this purpose, we calculate the

integral of the Berry curvature on a closed surface in k-space, which equals to the net

chirality of the Weyl nodes enclosed by the given compact surface. Due to the four fold

rotational symmetry and mirror planes that characterize TaAs, one only needs to search for

the Weyl points within the reduced BZ, i.e., one eighth of the whole BZ. The total chirality

or monopole charge enclosed in the whole reduced BZ is found to be one. This guarantees

the existence of, and odd number of Weyl points in one eighth of BZ. To determine the

exact location of each Weyl point, the reduced BZ is divided into very dense k-grid and the

Berry curvature or the “magnetic ﬁeld in momentum space”27,126,128 is calculated as shown

in Fig. 17. From this, one can easily identify the precise positions of the Weyl points by

searching for the “source” and “drain” points of the “magnetic ﬁeld”. Around the Weyl

points, the hedgehog like Berry curvature is clearly shown in Fig. 17.

Therefore, there are totally twelve pairs of Weyl points in TaAs as illustrated in Fig. 16(a).

All of them are in the vicinity of the nodal rings on two of the mirror invariant planes in

the SOC-free case. There are two types of Weyl nodes. W2 are those located oﬀ the kz = 0

plane, totally eight pairs. W2 is those located exactly in the kz = 0 plane, totally four

pairs. All W1 Weyl nodes are related by mirror symmetry, four-fold rotational symmetry,

and time reversal symmetry, so does it for W2. However, W1 and W2 are not related by any

symmetry and they can have diﬀerent velocity matrix and located at diﬀerent energy. For

example, in TaAs, W2 nodes are about 2 meV above the Fermi energy and form eight tiny

hole pockets, while the W1 nodes are about 21 meV below the Fermi level to form sixteen

on tight-binding model from MLWFs of Ta d and Te p orbitals. SOC is included as onsite

terms with 0.3 eV for Ta d and 0.2 eV for Te p as ﬁtted from ﬁrst-principles calculation with

SOC included. The band structures for the other three materials TaP, NbAs and NbP are

very similar. The precise positions of the Weyl points for all these materials are summarized

in Table. I.

One of the hallmark of WSM is the Fermi arcs on the surface.39,47,59 In TaAs family, there

are multiple Weyl points. When they are projected to one surface, some of them might be

on top of each other.

It is easy to see that the total number of surface modes at Fermi

level crossing a closed circle in surface BZ must equal to the sum of the “monopole charge”

of the Weyl points inside the 3D cylinder that projects to the given closed circle. Another

important fact determining the behavior of the surface states is the MCN introduced in

the above discussion, which limits the number of FSs cutting certain projection lines of the

mirror plane as long as this mirror symmetry is still preserved on the surface.

By using the Green’s function method44, the surface states for both (001) and (100)

surfaces have been calculated as shown in Fig. 18 together with its Fermi surface. On the

(001) surface, the crystal symmetry is reduced to C2v leading to diﬀerent behavior for the
surface bands around ¯X and ¯Y points respectively. Along the ¯Γ- ¯X or ¯Γ- ¯Y lines, Fermi

surface crosses it twice with opposite Fermi velocity. This satisﬁes the constraint from the

MCN for ΓZN plane. In addition to the MCN, the possible “connectivity pattern” of the

Fermi arcs on the surface has to link diﬀerent projection points of the Weyl nodes with

opposite chirality. However, for the (001) surface of TaAs, the connectivity pattern of the

Fermi arcs that satisfy all the conditions discussed is not unique. Only the appearance

of “Fermi arcs” on the (001) surface is guaranteed since all the projective points on the

(001) surface are generated either by a single Weyl point or by two Weyl points with the

same chirality. The Fermi arc connectivity pattern for (001) surface shown in Fig. 18(b)

is obtained from our ab-initio calculation on a non-relaxed surface described by the TB

model based on MLWFs of Ta d and Te p orbitals. Changes of surface potentials or the

simple relaxation of the surface charge density might lead to modiﬁcation of the Fermi arc

connectivity pattern and result in topological Fermi arc phase transitions on the surface.

30

The extremely long Fermi arcs which cross the zone boundary along the ¯X to ¯M line is

quite interesting. Comparing with other proposed WSM materials, the Fermi arcs in TaAs

families are much longer, which greatly facilitates their detection in experiments.

On the other hand, the surface states on (100) surface of TaAs are much more complicated

as shown in Fig. 18(c) and (d). The biggest diﬀerence between them is that all the projected

Weyl points on the (100) surface are formed by a pair of Weyl points with opposite chirality,

which does not guarantee (but does not disallow) the existence of the Fermi arcs. The

only constraint for the (100) surface states is the nonzero MCN of the ΓZN plane, which
generates a pair of chiral modes along the ¯Γ ¯Y line, the projection of the mirror plane, as

illustrated in Fig.18(d).

After this theoretical perdition, our collaborators and us have reported several experimen-

tal works to conﬁrm it. Totally, there are four hallmarks of WSM in TaAs family have been

observed: 1) Fermi arcs on its (001) surface;129 2) Weyl nodes in its bulk state;130 3) negative

magnetoresistivity due to “chiral anomaly”;131 4) Spin texture of the Fermi arcs on (001)

surface.132 The other experimental works appeared include Ref. 133–143. The topological

superconductivity144–147 is also expected for either DSM or WSM, and several experimental

eﬀorts148–150 have been reported.

4. Node-Line Semimetal

In the former two sections, we have discussed the TSMs with isolated Dirac cone like nodes

at or close to the Fermi level. However, there is another interesting electronic states having

the nodes forming a closed ring or periodically continuous line in momentum space. Such

kind of semimetal state now is known as topological nodal semimetal61 or topological Node-

Line semimetal (NLSM).151 In 2011, Burkov et al. proposed that a ﬁne tuned superlattice

of normal insulator and TI with broken TRS might realize NLSM.61 This is basically a

model proposal rather than a practically realizable material candidate.

In this section,

we will introduce some realistic 3D compounds proposed to host NLSM. The underlying

mechanism is also based on band inversion, which causes Node-Line when both TRS and IS

are conserved and SOC is neglected for light element compounds.

4. 1: All Carbon Mackay-Terrones Crystal

In 1992, A. L. Mackay and H. Terrones proposed that152 graphene can be extended to

form 3D networks by placing graphitic tiles consisting of 4- to 8-membered rings onto the

Schwarz minimal surface. Such kind of 3D all carbon allotrope is called as Mackay-Terrones

crystal (MTC). Schwarz minimal surface is a 3D periodic minimal surface with its mean

curvature H = (k1 + k2)/2 being zero and Gaussian curvature (K = k1k2) being negative

everywhere on it. The above k1 and k2 are the principal curvatures. There are various

Schwarz minimal surfaces, such as primitive (P), diamond (D) and gyroid (G) surface. One

type of MTC based on P-surface is shown in Fig. 19. Diﬀerent from C60-like fullerene, which

has positive Gaussian curvature, MTC has negative Gaussian curvature and is periodically

connected. It is shown such all-carbon MTC can host non-trivial electronic states, including

topological node-lines and 3D Dirac points, which are distinct from its 2D counter material

graphene. Similar node-lines have also been proposed in optimally tuned photonic crystal

they are essentially diﬀerent. The occupied and unoccupied low energy bands are triply-

degenerate at Γ, and have T1g (even parity) and T2u (odd parity) symmetry, respectively.

Moving away from Γ point, their degeneracy is lifted but at R point, their degeneracy is

recovered again. However, the odd and even eigenstates exchanges their energy ordering,

which is a typical band inversion picture. Thus, the band inversion leads to the band

will open a band gap on the nodal points and it becomes a 3D strong TI with Z2 index

Including SOC

(1;111)119,124 if the lower (upper) half of the anti-crossing bands are thought as occupied

(unoccupied). However, the computed SOC splitting is very small, around 0.13 meV or

equivalent to 1.5 K temperature, which can be neglected when temperature is higher than

1.5 K.

Without SOC, the most interesting thing found in MTC is that the band crossing points

lead to nodal lines rather than nodal points. In fact, the band crossings form closed loops

in the 3D momentum space, and generate three circular-like node-lines around the R point,

as shown in Fig. 20.

Detailed analysis indicates that these node-lines are protected by two factors. One is the

34

-0.4-0.3-0.2-0.100.10.20.30.40.5ΓMΓRRXEnergy (eV)ΓXMR(b)(a)Xcoexistence of TRS and IS and the other is that the SOC is negligible. The cubic symmetry

of MTC leads to three in-plane nodal rings. The node-lines are not necessarily to be ﬂat in

energy, i. e., the crossing points might be at diﬀerent energy level at diﬀerent k, which leads

to compensated electron and hole pockets along the node-lines.

Diﬀerent from other proposals for the topological node-lines, such as that in Ref. 61,

the appearance of node-lines in MTC is very stable and does not require ﬁne tuning of

any parameter. This mechanism to generate topological node-lines in 3D materials only

requires TRS, IS and negligible SOC, which can be easily applied to a large class of materials

consisting of mainly the light elements.

This topologically stable node-line semimetal state can have nontrivial surface states.61,155–158

For the (001)-surface, the three node-line rings are projected to be a ring and two orthog-

onal diameter segments inside of it as shown in Fig. 21(a). The (001)-surface state is

calculated based on a six-band TB model using both Green’s function method and slab-

model method.44 There is a nearly ﬂat surface band nestled inside of the projected node-line

ring with its band width being about 40 meV due to the particle-hole asymmetry. The

peak-like surface density of states contributed by this nearly ﬂat band is clearly shown in

Fig. 21(b). This is proposed to be an important route to high temperature surface supercon-

ductivity.159,160 The weight of wave function of the surface ﬂat band on each layer is shown

in Fig. 21(c). It penetrates just three layers into bulk with most of the weight on the surface

layer. The surface localization of these ﬂat bands is well resolved for those separated from

bulk bands. The nestled ﬂat surface states have small dispersion and their eigen energy

distribution in surface BZ is shown in Fig. 21(d), which looks like some vibrational mode

of “drumhead”. Such “drumhead”-like states are readily to be detected by angle-resolved

photoelectron spectroscopy or scanning tunnel microscope.

Recently, there have been many other eﬀorts in studying the NLSM,161–169 including the

theoretical proposal of Cu3PdN to be introduced in the following.

4. 2: Anti-Perovskite Cu3PdN

In this section, cubic anti-perovskite Cu3PdN is introduced.164 It is another example

system hosts Node-Line semimetal state protected by the coexistence of TRS and IS in case

with band inversion and negligible SOC. However, Pd is heavy element and quite strong

SOC might open band gap along the nodal line as discussed in Section 3. 2. Interestingly,

in Cu3PdN, the C4 rotational symmetry will protect the nodal points on the rotation axis

35

between two solid Dirac cones, which are the projection of one of the node-line circles as

indicated in the inset (red circle). The other two node-line rings are projected as two

orthogonal diameters (green line). (b) The surface density of state. (c) The wave function

and leads to DSM state. This is totally diﬀerent from the situation in TaAs, where SOC

opens band gap along the whole nodal ring but results in Weyl nodes oﬀ the nodal ring

plane. Thus, Cu3PdN is a DSM with three pairs of Dirac nodes distinguished from Na3Bi

and Cd3As2 with only one pair as shown in Section 2. 1 and 2. 2, respectively.

surface Brillouin zone. The three nodal line rings (orange color) and three pairs of Dirac

points (red points) without and with SOC included, respectively, are schematically shown.

Cubic perovskite Cu3PdN is shown in Fig. 22 together with its BZ and projected surface

BZ. The band structure of Cu3PdN is shown in Fig. 23. The valence and conduction bands

are mainly from Pd-4d (blue) and Pd-5p (red) states, respectively. The fatted bands indicate

there is band inversion at R with Pd-5p lower than Pd-4d by about 1.5 eV. This band

inversion is checked by hybrid functional56,57 calculation. If SOC is neglected the occupied

and unoccupied low energy bands are triply degenerate at R. These states belong to the
3D irreducible representations Γ−
5 of Oh group at R point, respectively. The band
inversion process in Cu3PdN is shown explicitly in Fig. 23(b), where the energy levels of
5 and Γ−
Γ+
4 bands at R point are calculated under diﬀerent hydrostatic strains. The band
inversion happens at a = 1.11a0 (a0 is experimental lattice constant) and the inversion

4 and Γ+

energy increases as further compressing the lattice.

The intriguing point of the Cu3PdN band structure without SOC is that the band cross-

ings due to the band inversion form a nodal ring because of the coexistence of TRS and

IS as addressed in Section 4. 1. Due to the cubic symmetry, there are three mutually

perpendicular nodal rings centering R as schematically shown in Fig. 22.

band structure with SOC included. A small gap is opened in the R-X direction while the

Dirac point in the R-M direction is stable and protected by crystal symmetry C4 rotation.

When SOC is considered with spin degree of freedom included, the six-fold degenerate

states at R are split into one four-fold and one two-fold degenerate states. Around the Fermi

level, the occupied one has Γ+

8 symmetry. Both
of them are four-fold degenerate. Along R-X direction, the little group symmetry is lowered

8 symmetry and the unoccupied one has Γ−

to C2v. The four-fold degenerate states at R are split into two-fold degenerate states. The
two bands seem to cross each other have the same Γ5 symmetry and a gap ∼0.062 eV is
opened at the intersection as shown in the inset of Fig. 23(b).

However, along R-M direction, the symmetry is characterized by C4v double group. As

38

indicated in Fig. 23(c), the two sets of bands close to Fermi energy belong to Γ7 and Γ6

representation, respectively. They are decoupled and the crossing point on R-M path is

unaﬀected by SOC.They form a Dirac node near the Fermi energy as shown in Fig. 23(c),

which is protected by C4 rotational symmetry53,54,170. If C4 rotational symmetry is broken,

the Dirac node will be gapped and the Z2 indices of such gapped system are (1;111), indi-

cating a strong TI. The band structure of Cu3PdN is diﬀerent from that of antiperovskite
Sr3PbO171 and Ca3PbO172, where the band inversion happens at Γ point and the involved

bands belong to the same irreducible presentation, which leads to anti-crossing along Γ-X

direction.

The band inversion and the 3D Dirac cones in Cu3PdN suggest the presence of topologi-

cally nontrivial surface states. The calculated band structures and surface density of states

(DOS) on semi-inﬁnite (001) surface are presented in Fig. 24.

Without SOC, the bulk state is the same as MTC151 and there exists surface ﬂat bands

nestled inside the projected nodal line ring on the (001) surface, namely the “drumhead”

states as shown in Figure 24(a). The peak-like DOS from these nearly ﬂat bands is also

clearly shown. The small dispersion of this “drumhead” state comes from the fact that

the nodal line ring is not necessarily on the same energy level due to the particle-hole

asymmetry61,151,173. Such 2D ﬂat bands and nearly inﬁnite DOS are proposed as a route to

achieving high-temperature superconductivity159,160,173.

In the presence of SOC, each ring is driven into one pair of Dirac nodes. The (001) surface
state band structure in Fig. 24(b) clearly shows the gapped bulk state along ¯Γ- ¯M direction

and the existence of surface Dirac cone due to topologically nontrivial Z2 indices as seen
in Na3Bi53 and Cd3As2.54 The bulk band structure along R-X and R-M overlap each other
when projected onto (001) surface along the ¯X- ¯M path. The bulk Dirac cones are hidden

by other bulk bands. Therefore, it is diﬃcult to identify the detailed connection of Fermi

arcs in the Fermi surface plotting as shown in Fig. 25, though some eyebrow-like Fermi arcs

can be clearly seen around these projected Dirac nodes.

5. Discussion and Prospect

Topological semimetals, as a nontrivial extension of topological classiﬁcation of electronic

quantum state from insulator to metal, have been a spotlight in the ﬁeld of condensed matter

physics in recent years. The theoretical prediction of these topologically nontrivial quantum

state has played a crucial role in stimulating this ﬁeld greatly. An uncompleted survey on the

39

with SOC . Without SOC, the nearly ﬂat surface bands are clearly shown in the white

dashed box around ¯M point.

existing theoretical proposals of candidate compounds for each member of TSMs have been

listed in Table. II. The DSM classiﬁcation is following those of Ref. 174. Presently widely

studied DSM materials Na3Bi and Cd3As2 are both predicted ﬁrstly and then conﬁrmed

experimentally. The ﬁrst WSM of TaAs family is also predicted by theoretical calculation.

and recently they are under intensive study. The proposed FM half-metal states in HgCr2Se4

has also been conﬁrmed and it is now much close to the ﬁnal conﬁrmation of its double WSM

state. NLSM is the next challenge to be discovered and the predicted candidates are waiting

for their experimental veriﬁcations.

As mentioned in the introduction, the most interesting phenomena cause by the existence

of the Weyl points near the Fermi energy is so called chiral anomaly, where the electrons

under parallel magnetic and electric ﬁeld will be pumped from one Weyl nodes to another

one with opposite chirality. In solid states, this pumping process will be eventually balanced

potential at 0.12 eV (green dashed line in Fig. 24 (b). The yellow dots are projected Dirac

by the inter-valley scattering terms generated by the impurities leading to a steady state

carrying extra chiral current along the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld with the strength being

promotional to the inner product of E and B ﬁelds. How chiral pumping eﬀect can manifests

itself in experimental measurable quantities is one of the key issues in the study of TSM now.

Both theoretical analysis and experimental studies seem to suggest that the chiral anomaly

will cause universal negative magneto resistance being proportional to -B2 only in the weak

magnetic ﬁeld limit.

In the quantum limit under strong magnetic ﬁeld, the inter Valley

scattering rate will depend on ﬁeld strength as well, which make the behavior of magneto

resistance in quantum limit to be related to the detail properties of the impurity potential

and non universal. Although the negative magneto resistance under parallel magnetic and

electric ﬁelds has been experimentally observed in several Weyl, Dirac and even massive

Dirac materials, how this can be explained uniquely by chiral anomaly is still far from

clear. Other eﬀects that may induced by chiral anomaly, i.e. chiral magnetic eﬀect, nonlocal

transport eﬀect and unique optical properties, are still to be observed experimentally.

Through this topical review, the relationship among these TSMs is revealed and summa-

each other.

rized in Fig. 26. In the spinless case without including SOC, the coexistence of TRS and

IS protects the NLSM state where the band inversion leads to nodal points. Starting from

such NLSM, including SOC might lead it to DSM (such as Cu3PdN), TI (such as MTC)

and WSM (such as TaAs family). For DSM, introducing diﬀerent mass term can drive it to

normal insulator or TI and breaking either TRS or IS will lead to WSM.
