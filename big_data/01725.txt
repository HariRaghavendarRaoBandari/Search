Materials which possess a high local density of states varying at a subwavelength scale theoretically
permit to focus waves onto focal spots much smaller than the free space wavelength. To do so
metamaterials -manmade composite media exhibiting properties not available in nature- are usually
considered. However this approach is limited to narrow bandwidths due to their resonant nature.
Here, we prove that it is possible to use a fractal resonator alongside time reversal to focus microwaves
onto λ/15 subwavelength focal spots from the far ﬁeld, on extremely wide bandwidths. We ﬁrst
numerically prove that this approach can be realized using a multiple channel time reversal mirror,
that utilizes all the degrees of freedom oﬀered by the fractal resonator. Then we experimentally
demonstrate that this approach can be drastically simpliﬁed by coupling the fractal resonator to a
complex medium, here a cavity, that eﬃciently converts its spatial degrees of freedom into temporal
ones. This allows to achieve deep subwavelength focusing of microwaves using a single channel
time reversal. Our method can be generalized to other systems coupling complex media and fractal
resonators.

Controlling the propagation of waves in complex me-
dia is of fundamental interest in a wide range of research
ﬁelds from imaging in biological tissues to geophysics and
telecommunications. In the past, it was shown that wave-
front shaping techniques permit to image and focus waves
in and through multiple scattering or reverberating me-
dia. Such methods can experimentally vary between the
diﬀerent ﬁelds: Time reversal is used in microwaves and
acoustics [1–4], whereas phase conjugation [5, 6], spatial
light modulators [7–9], or photoacoustics [10] are used in
optics. However, those methods rely on the same basis:
They make use of spatial or temporal degrees of free-
dom [11–13] or both [3, 8, 14–18] to focus waves in com-
plex media. So called spatial degrees of freedom corre-
spond to the number of independent collected modes at a
ﬁxed frequency, whereas the temporal degrees of freedom
refer to the number of uncorrelated modes within a given
bandwidth.

Focusing waves in complex media amounts to coher-
ently add such modes either at a given location with
wave-front shaping or at a given time and location with
time reversal. In the vicinity of the focal spot the modes
interfere constructively in a spatiotemporal window, and
destructively out of it. The dimensions of such coher-
ence window are ﬁxed by the correlation time, given by
the inverse of the bandwidth of the modes supported by
the medium, and correlation length of the ﬁeld, given by
the highest spatial frequency of the eigenmodes [3].

Reducing the size of the focal spot down to subwave-
length dimensions is of prime importance for bio-imaging
or nanolithography applications. This requires media
with a LDOS varying at the subwavelength scale which
can be achieved with subwavelength varying random me-
dia [9, 19–23]. Yet such approach is very limited in
resolution in optics because of the small values of the

electric permittivity. Another approach consists in using
metamaterials that can eﬃciently manipulate the evanes-
cent waves [24–33]. However, the resonant nature of such
materials restricts such approach to narrow bandwidths,
which limits the number of degrees of freedom that can
be harnessed. Moreover, dissipation not only equally re-
strains the number of degrees of freedom but also the
ﬁeld of view of metamaterial based lenses.

In this Letter, we prove in the microwave domain that
it is possible to focus waves at deep subwavelength scales
and on very wide bandwidths, using a fractal resonator.
To do so we ﬁrst use a one channel time reversal mir-
ror [11] and a Hilbert fractal resonator of order 6. Yet,
we prove that such approach results in a very low focusing
quality owing to the poorly resonant nature of the fractal.
Hence we simulate a multiple channel time reversal in or-
der to increase the number of exploited spatial degrees
of freedom, and show that it allows deep subwavelength
focusing of microwaves with very low residual sidelobes.
We ﬁnally propose to simplify drastically this approach
by coupling the fractal to a complex medium, that con-
verts these spatial degrees of freedom into temporal ones.
Henceforth we use a very simple experimental apparatus
consisting of a reverberating cavity opened by a fractal
resonator, and demonstrate experimentally focal spots as
small as λ/15, obtained with one channel far ﬁeld time
reversal.

Fractals [34] are geometrical objects with a Hausdorﬀ
dimension [35] which is diﬀerent from their topological
dimension. They also possess self-similarity and scale in-
variant properties: A phenomenon occurring at a given
scale also occurs at many other ones. Hence, a fractal res-
onator exhibits in a wide bandwidth many log-periodic
resonances [36–38]. Those scale invariant properties are
widely used in physics and engineering to design meta-

materials [36, 39–43], wide band antennas [44, 45], ﬁl-
ters [37, 46, 47], cavities and diﬀusers [48, 49] in optics,
microwaves and acoustics.

We decide to use a planar fractal in order to manipulate
a convenient ﬂat lens. Moreover focusing waves wherever
in its near ﬁeld also requires the fractal to be as homo-
geneous as possible. Hence, we choose to work with the
Hilbert curve (Fig. 1(a) presents a Hilbert curve of order
4). The Hilbert curve is one dimensional but ﬁlls a two
dimensional plane: It is a one dimensional object with a
Hausdorﬀ dimension of two. The total length of the nth
fractal order is Ln = l0(2n−1/2n) for a footprint of l2
0: Its
total length Ln is much larger than its apparent length
l0. Therefore a metallic Hilbert fractal is nothing else
than a folded wire, and its fundamental mode schemat-
ically occurs at a wavelength λn ≈ Ln/2 ≈ l02n−2. In
other words, a Hilbert resonator possesses a footprint
much smaller than the wavelength at resonance and con-
stitutes a subwavelength resonator. Here, we use this
property to set a high number of subwavelength modes
in our bandwidth: the higher the fractal order, the higher
the LDOS and the more subwavelength the modes. Dissi-
pation is also limited as we work in transmission on a ﬂat
resonator with waves impinging on the transverse size of
the fractal, contrary to previous works [29, 31]. Hence
the Hilbert curve provides three main beneﬁts compared
to other resonators: It ﬁlls a two-dimensional plane, it
exhibits many resonances, and such resonances are sub-
wavelength and occur in a very wide bandwidth.

We start by measuring the transmission through a
Hilbert curve of order 6 from the far ﬁeld. The set-
up is shown on Fig. 1(a): A network analyzer measures
the transmission through a metallic fractal. The latter
is made of copper and is printed with a PCB lithogra-
phy technique on a dielectric substrate. Its footprint is
120 mm by 120 mm wide for a total length of 7.7 m. As
this footprint corresponds to the wavelength at 2 GHz,
the resonator supports a very large number of subwave-
length resonances that permit the waves to go through,
although the holes in the metal are very small (around a
few millimeters) compared to the wavelength [40]. On
one side a horn antenna emits microwaves within the
1.5 GHz to 3 GHz bandwidth from the far ﬁeld at 1.5 m
of the fractal, and the network analyzer measures the re-
ceived voltage on a probe placed on the other side in the
near ﬁeld of the fractal. The latter is placed at 0.5 mm of
the fractal on a two dimensional translation stage which
scans the plane in a 120 by 120 mm2 area.

The network analyzer measures a transmission spec-
trum for all probe positions, from which we obtain the
transient Green’s function of the medium with an inverse
Fourier transform. Fig. 1(b) presents the transmission
spectrum averaged on the positions. Fig. 1(c) presents
the measured time signal at a given position of the near
ﬁeld probe: After a 5 ns delay corresponding to the time
of ﬂight for the 1.5 m distance between the two anten-

nas, a signal is received. The resonating nature of the
fractal lengthens the initial 0.67 ns pulse, and we mea-
sure a longer coda that decreases with a characteristic
time of 15 ns. Within the 1.5 GHz to 3 GHz bandwidth,
this signal provides 12 temporal degrees of freedom [50],
that we can use to focus the wave ﬁeld at a given time
and position, r0. We use here a broad band approach
to synchronize the subwavelength modes: time reversal.
Experimentally, the time signal recorded at the position
r0, would be time reversed and sent back from the horn
antenna, and the near ﬁeld probe would measure the ﬁeld
received at any position r. We do so numerically as this
amounts to compute the cross-correlation of the signal
measured at position r0 with the signal measured at po-
sition r. Fig. 2(d) presents the maximum value over time
of the energy of the computed ﬁeld. A subwavelength
spot of size λ/10 (where λ is the central wavelength) is
obtained at the focal position r0 with a single antenna
emitting from the far ﬁeld. However for other targeted lo-
cations (Fig. 2(e,f)), there are supplementary illuminated
hot spots, even far away from the target, in addition to a

FIG. 2: Simulations: focusing with an order 6 Hilbert frac-
tal and 10 spatial degrees of freedom. (a) Simulated set-up.
The Hilbert curve is illuminated by 90 plane waves (45 angles
of incidence and two orthogonal polarizations) of Gaussian
pulses, three of them are represented in red, blue and green.

high background. Even if subwavelength focal spots are
obtained, the low quality background and the additional
hot spots decrease the focusing quality with a low signal
to noise ratio (SNR) [50].

In order to improve the focusing quality and the SNR,
a solution is to increase the number of spatial degrees
of freedom, i.e. the number of source antennas. There-
fore we decide to illuminate the fractal with 90 diﬀerent
plane waves (45 diﬀerent incident angles and 2 orthogonal
polarizations [50]). We opt for a numerical study (using
CST Microwave studio) as such a procedure would be ex-
perimentally cumbersome. First, we simulate the ﬁelds
excited by each of those 90 plane waves. However those
plane waves produce only 10 uncorrelated ﬁelds on the
fractal [50], meaning that the number of spatial degrees
of freedom is Ns = 10 instead of the expected 90. We
evaluate the number of temporal degrees of freedom to
Nt = 22 [50]. The latter is higher than in previous mea-
surements, but of the same order of magnitude. Hence
the total number of spatiotemporal degrees of freedom
is Ntot = Ns × Nt = 220. We then use time reversal to
synchronize those degrees of freedom at a given time and
at position r0. To do so, the signals previously measured
at r0 for every plane wave are time reversed and sent
back through their corresponding plane wave. We record
the sum of the interfering ﬁelds in a plane at 1 mm of
the fractal. Three focal spots displayed on Fig. 2 exhibit
very sub-wavelength dimensions (around λ/10), and a
very low background. Those results prove that increas-

ing the number of spatial degrees of freedom by an order
of magnitude eﬃciently improves the focusing capabili-
ties of the fractal.

However using such a number of transient sources is ex-
perimentally challenging. As a consequence, we propose
a very simple experimental set-up shown on Fig. 3(a). We
use a steel commercial cavity of 1 m3 volume, opened on
one side by the fractal (Fig. 3(a)). The Q factor is about
1800. An isotropic antenna is placed inside the cavity
to replace the horn antenna of Fig. 1(a). As schemed
on Fig. 3(b), the cavity creates ﬁctive sources as mirror
images of the real ones, and which provide additional de-

incident wave vectors). As there
is only one real source, the number of spatial degrees of
freedom is 1. However, the ﬁctive sources provide addi-
tional temporal degrees of freedom by increasing the time
of ﬂight from the emitters to the fractal. Hence the tem-
poral signal measured is much longer with a cavity than
without: The number of temporal degrees of freedom
has been increased. Indeed, as shown on the Fig. 3(c),
the measured signal now attenuates more slowly in a
characteristic time of 300 ns: The coda lasts 20 times
longer. We note that the envelope of the transmission
spectrum with a cavity is quite diﬀerent than without
it, as the horn antenna has been replaced by an isotropic
WI-FI antenna, which operates in a narrower bandwidth.
Therefore, the total number of spatiotemporal degrees of
freedom is Ntot = 150 [50], a bit lower than in simu-
lations, but of the same order of magnitude, and much
higher than the number of degrees of freedom obtained
in free space with only one antenna. This enhancement
is directly translated into the spectral domain: The ini-
tial modes are now 20 times better resolved than with
only one antenna, as we see on the averaged transmis-
sion (Fig. 3(d)).

Now that we have experimentally increased by an or-
der of magnitude the number of degrees of freedom of the
fractal resonator, we can focus waves with one-channel
time reversal, as we did in the ﬁrst experiment. Fig. 3(e-
g) show the results with the maximum value over time
of the energy at each position of the measurement plane.
We see subwavelength focal spots at the desired places,
with full widths at half maximum around 8 mm, less than
λ/15. Contrary to the case without a cavity on Fig. 2(d),
there is no side lobe and the background is very low with
a high SNR. The results are equivalent to the simula-
tion results with multiple illuminations, but thanks to
the cavity, we obtained them with a single emitter.

In order to study the impact of the fractal order, we
run similar experiments for orders ranging from 4 to 7.
The average focal widths for each order are shown in
Fig. 3(h). The sizes of the focal spots decrease with the
fractal order, owing to the fact that the higher the order,
the smaller the coherence length of the resonator. How-
ever, this phenomenon saturates for the highest measured
fractal orders. In such cases, the modes have a very high
spectral density, and cannot be resolved anymore even
by our cavity, which leads to the saturation of the num-
ber of temporal degrees of freedom. A Hilbert fractal of
order 6 printed on a low loss dielectric substrate (NEL-
TEC NH9338ST, tangent loss δ = 3 10−3), does not
show signiﬁcant diﬀerences compared to the FR4 sub-
strate (tan δ = 3 10−2), underlying the fact that the
modes of the Hilbert fractal of order 6 are just resolved
by the cavity which limits the focusing for higher fractal
orders.

The last point to clarify is the role of the cavity.
Namely, how can this complex medium exploit optimally

the degrees of freedom of the fractal resonator ? To il-
lustrate this point, we compare the modes measured in a
narrow bandwidth without and with a cavity. Fig. 4(a)
presents the considered bandwidth of 2.18 to 2.28 GHz,
with a smooth transmission spectrum without a cavity,
and well resolved modes for the transmission with a cav-
ity. In this bandwidth, we select 10 frequencies close to
each other (green arrows of Fig. 4(a)). Fig. 4(b) and (c)
show the phase of the transmission of the ﬁelds at two
among of those frequencies (2.218 GHz and 2.23 GHz)
measured without a cavity : They are almost identical.
Indeed, the cross-correlation coeﬃcients (Fig. 4(d)) of
those ten modes are very high (above 0.7). Hence the
electromagnetic ﬁelds are the same at any of these fre-
quencies: There is only one temporal degree of freedom
in this bandwidth. On the contrary, the ﬁelds obtained
with the cavity at the ﬁrst and last frequencies are very
diﬀerent (Fig. 4(e) and (f)) as conﬁrmed by the very
low cross-correlation coeﬃcients of the ten modes infe-
rior to 0.5. Hence, with a cavity, all those modes are
quasi-uncorrelated: Any of them provide a temporal de-
gree of freedom for the focusing. The cavity provides
spectrally distinguishable illuminations on the fractal res-
onator within one resonance of the fractal. This permits
to replace the multiple illuminations thanks to the com-
plexity of the cavity: a single spatial degree of freedom
(one source) can provide multiple temporal degrees of

In this Letter, we have achieved sub-wavelength focus-
ing down to λ/15 from the far ﬁeld using a fractal res-
onator and time reversal in the microwave domain. Play-
ing with the spatial and temporal degrees of freedom, we
have shown that fractals are good candidate to achieve
subwavelength resolution and proved that by adding a
reverberating medium, multiple illuminations can be re-
placed by a single one. We also illustrated the impact
of the fractal order: a fractal resonator possesses a very
high number of low frequency modes. The majority of
those subwavelength modes cannot be excited by a sin-
gle source. To reveal and make use of such modes, it is
necessary to increase the number of degrees of freedom.
We believe that such approach, that is coupling a com-
plex medium with a fractal resonator can be generalized
to other domains. For instance in optics, one could use
a random medium to increase the number of degrees of
freedom and to resolve the modes of a metallic ﬁlm at
the percolation threshold [51], which is fractal.
