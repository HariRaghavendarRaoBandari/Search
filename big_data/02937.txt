Geometric estimation of a potential and cone

conditions of a body

Abstract

We investigate a potential obtained as the convolution of a radially symmetric function and the
characteristic function of a body (the closure of a bonded open set) with exterior cones. In order to
restrict the location of a maximizer of the potential into a smaller closed region contained in the inte-
rior of the body, we give an estimate of the potential using the exterior cones of the body. Moreover,
we apply the result to the Poisson integral for the upper half space.

Introduction

Let Ω be a body (the closure of a bounded open set) in Rm. We consider a potential of the form

KΩ(x, t) =ZΩ

k (|x − ξ| , t) dξ, x ∈ Rm, t > 0,

(1.1)

and investigate its spatial maximizer.

When k(r, t) is given by the Gauss kernel, the potential KΩ(x, t) is the solution of the Cauchy problem

for the heat equation with initial datum χΩ,

WΩ(x, t) =

1

(4πt)m/2 ZΩ

exp −|x − ξ|2

4t ! dξ, x ∈ Rm, t > 0.

(1.2)

A spatial maximizer of WΩ is called a hot spot of Ω at time t.

In [4], Chavel and Karp showed that Ω has a hot spot for each t, that any hot spot belongs to the
convex hull of Ω, and that the set of hot spots converges to the one-point set of the centroid (center
of mass) of Ω as t goes to inﬁnity with respect to the Hausdorﬀ distance. Furthermore, calculating the
Hessian of WΩ(·, t) : Rm → R, in [9], Jimbo and Sakaguchi indicated that Ω has a unique hot spot
whenever t ≥ (diam Ω)2/2. Roughly speaking, the large-time behavior of hot spots was studied in [4, 9].
(To tell the truth, in [4, 9], the above properties of hot spots were shown for a non-zero non-negative
bounded compactly supported initial datum. But, in this paper, we are interested in the case where the
initial datum is given by the characteristic function of a body.)

In contrast, in [10], Karp and Peyerimhoﬀ gave a geometric heat comparison criteria and investigated
the small-time behavior of hot spots. Roughly speaking, they compared two heat ﬂows for two points
in two diﬀerent bodies by using the distance functions from the complements and showed that any
sequence of hot spots of Ω at time tℓ converges to an incenter of Ω as tℓ tends to zero. Let us review
their exact statement as below: Let X and Y be bodies in Rm; Fix two constants R > S ≥ 0; Let

1

X ′ = {x ∈ X| dist(x, X c) ≥ R}, and Y ′ = {y ∈ Rm| dist(y, Y c) ≤ S}; Then, we can choose a small
time τ such that if 0 < t < τ , then, for any x ∈ X ′ and y ∈ Y ′, we have HX (x, t) > HY (y, t); Taking
X = Y = Ω and R = R∞(Ω) = max dist(ξ, Ωc) (the inradius), we can conclude that, for any decreasing
sequence {tℓ} with zero limiting value and any hot spot h(tℓ) of Ω at time tℓ, the distance between h(tℓ)
and the set of incenters IΩ = {ξ ∈ Ω| dist(ξ, Ωc) = R∞(Ω)} tends to zero as ℓ goes to inﬁnity. (To tell
the truth, they investigated the above comparison theorem in Riemannian manifolds. But, in this paper,
we are interested in Euclidean case.) We also refer to [12, pp. 2–3] for the small-time behavior of hot
spots.

On the other hand, in [19], for the kernel k in (1.1), the author gave a suﬃcient condition implying
the results shown in [4, 9]. As a by-product, for example, his suﬃcient condition can be applied to the
Poisson integral for the upper half space,

PΩ(x, h) =

2h

σm (Sm)ZΩ(cid:16)|x − ξ|2 + h2(cid:17)−(m+1)/2

dξ, x ∈ Rm, h > 0,

(1.3)

where σm denotes the m-dimensional spherical Lebesgue measure. Precisely, his suﬃcient condition
implies that the function PΩ(·, h) : Rm → R has a maximizer for each h, that any maximizer of PΩ(·, h)
belongs to the convex hull of Ω, that the set of maximizers of PΩ(·, h) converges to the one-point set of
the centroid of Ω as h goes to inﬁnity with respect to the Hausdorﬀ distance, and that PΩ(·, h) has a
unique maximizer whenever h ≥ √m + 2 diam Ω.
Here, we remark that the Poisson integral PΩ satisﬁes the Laplace equation for the upper half space,

that is,

PΩ(x, h) = χΩ(x), x ∈ Rm \ ∂Ω.

(1.4)

(1.5)

In order to understand the geometric meaning of the author’s results on maximizers of PΩ(·, h), let
AΩ = σm(Sm)PΩ/2. The function AΩ is obtained in the following manner: Let x be a point in Rm, and
h a positive constant; Deﬁne the map

p(x,h) : Ω × {0} ∋ (ξ, 0) 7→

(ξ, 0) − (x, h)
|(ξ, 0) − (x, h)| ∈ Sm;

(1.6)

The solid angle of Ω at (x, h) is deﬁned as the m-dimensional spherical Lebesgue measure of the image
p(x,h)(Ω) (see Figure 1), and direct calculation shows

σm(cid:0)p(x,h)(Ω)(cid:1) = hZΩ(cid:16)|x − ξ|2 + h2(cid:17)−(m+1)/2

dξ = AΩ(x, h).

(1.7)

In [22], the solid angle of Ω as (x, h) was regarded as the “brightness” of Ω having a light source at (x, h).
We call a maximizer of AΩ(·, h) an illuminating center of Ω of height h. Thus, the properties of PΩ shown
in [19] are understood as the large-height behavior of illuminating centers. In other words, it was shown
that the large-parameter behavior of spatial maximizers of PΩ is similar to that of WΩ.

From such backgrounds, in this paper, in order to compare small-parameter behavior of spatial max-
imizers of PΩ and WΩ, we mainly investigate the small-height behavior of illuminating centers. Informal
computation shows

AΩ(x, h)

(1.10)

Here, we remark that the latter equality (1.10) holds whenever 0 < ε < dist(x, Ωc) (see Proposition 2.7).
It is expected that any sequence of illuminating centers of height hℓ converges to a maximizer of V (−1)
as hℓ tends to zero. This expectation comes from the following procedure: Let ε > 0 be small enough;
Suppose that, for any small enough h > 0, any illuminating center is at least ε away from the boundary
of Ω; Since the Poisson kernel is radially symmetric, the solid angle of Bε(x) at (x, h) depends only on
ε and h; Decomposing the solid angle function as AΩ(x, h) = AΩ\Bε(x)(x, h) + ABε(x)(x, h), a point c(h)
is an illuminating center if and only if it is a maximizer of AΩ\Bε(·)(·, h); As h tends to zero, the kernel
(|x − ξ|2 + h2)−(m+1)/2 converges to |x − ξ|−(m+1) uniformly for ξ in Ω \ Bε(x); Roughly speaking, if the
height parameter h is small enough, then we have

In order to formulate the above procedure, we have to give a closed subset in the interior of Ω such
that it contains all the illuminating centers for any small enough h > 0. This is because we can use the
expression (1.10) of the potential V (−1)
only in the interior of Ω. Namely, in (1.10), we want to take a
uniform ε for illuminating centers of any small enough height and maximizers of V (−1)

We refer to [1, 2, 17, 18, 19, 20] for the study on the location of maximizers of a potential. Some
authors tried to restrict the location of maximizers of a potential into a smaller region. Using the moving
plane argument ([5, 21]), all the maximizers of a potential with a radially symmetric strictly decreasing
kernel are contained in the minimal unfolded region of Ω. (The minimal unfolded region is sometimes
called the heart.) But, in general, the minimal unfolded region of Ω is not contained in the interior of Ω
(see Example 2.22).

In this paper, assuming the uniform interior cone condition for the complement of the body Ω (see

Deﬁnition 2.1) and taking the following three steps, we formulate the above procedure:
Step 1. We give a constant 0 < ˜R < R∞(Ω) such that, for any x ∈ Ω with dist(x, Ωc) = R∞(Ω) and
belongs

(x). Namely, any maximizer of V (−1)

(y) < V (−1)

y ∈ Ω with dist(y, Ωc) ≤ ˜R, we have V (−1)
to the inner-parallel body of Ω of radius ˜R.

Ω

Ω

Step 2. For any constant 0 < b < 1, there exits a positive h0 such that if 0 < h < h0, then, for any
x ∈ Ω with dist(x, Ωc) = R∞(Ω) and y ∈ Rm with dist(y, Ωc) ≤ b ˜R, we have AΩ(y, h) < AΩ(x, h).
Namely, if h is suﬃciently small, then any illuminating center belongs to the inner-parallel body of
Ω of radius b ˜R.

Step 3. The limit point of any illuminating center of height hℓ must be a maximizer of V (−1)

Ω

.

Moreover, the above argument can be extended to a general case. Precisely, we give the same estimate

as in the ﬁrst step to the Hadamard ﬁnite part of the Riesz potential,

Also, we give the same estimate as in the second step to a potential of the form (1.1). In other words,
our main result in this paper is the estimate of a potential like the second step, and, as its by-product,
we derive the small-height behavior of illuminating centers.

2 Preliminaries

2.1 Cone conditions

Let us prepare the cone conditions which are related to the complexity of the boundary of a body.
Throughout this paper, we understand that C is an open cone of vertex x, axis direction v, aperture
angle κ and height δ if C is given as

C =nx + ρRv(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

0 < ρ < δ, R ∈ SO(m), Rv · v > cos

Deﬁnition 2.1. An open set U in Rm satisﬁes the uniform interior cone condition if there exists an
open cone C in Rm such that, for each point x ∈ U , we can take an open cone of vertex x contained in
U and congruent to C.

Deﬁnition 2.2. An open set U in Rm satisﬁes the uniform boundary inner cone condition if there exists
an open cone C in Rm such that, for each point x ∈ ∂U , we can take an open cone of vertex x contained
in U and congruent to C.

The proof of the following Lemma is due to Hiroaki Aikawa.

Lemma 2.3. Let U be an open set in Rm. If U satisﬁes the uniform interior cone condition for an open
cone C of aperture angle κ and height δ, then it also satisﬁes the uniform boundary inner cone condition
for the cone C.

Proof. Fix a point x on the boundary of U . For each natural number n, we take a point ξn from
B1/n(x) ∩ U . Thanks to the uniform interior cone condition of U , we can take an open cone C(ξn) of
vertex ξn contained in U and congruent to C. Let vn be the axis direction of C(ξn). Since the unit
sphere Sm−1 is compact in Rm, we may assume that the sequence {vn} converges to a direction v.
Let C(x) be the open cone of vertex x and axis direction v congruent to C. We show that C(x) is
contained in U . Suppose that C(x) is not contained in U . We take a point from C(x) ∩ U c. The point
can be expressed as x + ρRv for some 0 < ρ < δ and rotation matrix R with Rv · v > cos(κ/2). We
remark that the point ξn + ρRvn is in C(ξn). Since C(ξn) is contained in U for any n, we have

where θ = arccos(Rv · v). On the other hand, for any large enough n,

|(x + ρRv) − (ξn + ρRvn)| ≥ dist (ξn + ρRvn, U c) ≥ minnδ − ρ, ρ sin(cid:16) κ
2 − θ(cid:17)o ,

|(x + ρRv) − (ξn + ρRvn)| <

which is a contradiction.

2 − θ(cid:17)o ,

Remark 2.4. Let Ω be a body (the closure of a bounded open set) in Rm. Regarding a half space as
a cone of aperture angle π and height +∞, Ω is convex if and only if the complement of Ω satisﬁes the
uniform boundary inner cone condition of aperture angle π and height +∞.
Remark 2.5. In Lemma 2.3, for an open set U , we showed that the uniform interior cone condition
implies the uniform boundary inner cone condition. We remark that the converse statement does not
always hold. For example, let us consider an open unit disc and remove a cusp from the disc near the
center. Let U be such an open set. Then, U satisﬁes the uniform boundary inner cone condition but not
the uniform interior cone condition.

The author would like to express his gratitude to Professor Hiroaki Aikawa for informing him of this

example.
Problem 2.6. Let U be the interior of a body in Rm. Does the uniform boundary inner cone condition
of U imply the uniform interior cone condition of U ?

2.2 Renormalization of the Riesz potential

Let Ω be a body (the closure of a bounded open set) in Rm. We consider the Riesz potential of Ω of order
0 < α < m,

We remark that if α ≤ 0, then the above integral diverges for any interior point x of Ω. In [17], O’Hara
extended the potential V (α)
to the case of α ≤ 0 by using the same renormalizing process as in the
deﬁnition of his energy of knots introduced in [15, 16]. Precisely, for α ≤ 0 and x ∈

Since this statement will play an important role in this paper, we review its proof (see also [17, Lemma

2.4]).

Proof. We show the statement in the case of α < 0. Replacing the renormalization term, the proof in
the case of α = 0 goes parallel.

Fix an arbitrary interior point x of Ω. Let 0 < δ < ε < dist(x, Ωc). Since we have

we get

Ω \ Bε(x) = (Ω \ Bδ(x)) \ (Bε(x) \ Bδ(x)),

Suppose that the complement of Ω satisﬁes the uniform boundary inner cone condition for an open

Deﬁnition 2.11 ([17, Deﬁnition 3.1]). Let Ω be a body in Rm. An interior point c of Ω is called an
rα−m-center of Ω if it gives the maximum value of the restriction of V (α)

Remark 2.12. The name of a maximizer of V (α)
a radial center of a star body A as a maximizer of a function of the form

Ω , rα−m-center, is originated in [13]. Moszy´nska deﬁned

ΦA(x) =ZSm−1

ϕ (ρA−x(v)) dσ(v), x ∈ Ker A :=(cid:8)ξ ∈ A(cid:12)(cid:12)∀η ∈ A, ξη ⊂ A(cid:9) ,

where ρA−x(v) = max{λ ≥ 0|x + λv ∈ A} is the radial function of A with respect to x, and ξη denotes
the line segment from ξ to η. If ϕ(r) = rα/α (0 < α < m), then the function ΦA coincides the Riesz
potential V (α)
A .

Her motivation comes from the study on the intersection body of a star body. Intersection bodies were
introduced by Lutwak in [11] to given an aﬃrmative answer to Busemann and Petty’s problem [3]. The
intersection body of a star body A is deﬁned by the radial function as ρIA = Volm−1(A ∩ v⊥). Thus, the
deﬁnition depends on the position of the origin. In [13], Moszy´nska looked for an optimal position of the
origin (see also [14, Part III]).

We refer to [6] for the physical meaning of the study on centers of a body. The uniqueness of a radial
center was discussed in [7, 13] but the investigation in [7] has an error, and it was pointed out in [17, 20].

Using the form of the potential V (α)

Ω in Remark 2.12, we can show the concavity of V (α)

Ω if Ω is convex.

Theorem 2.13 ([17, Theorem 3.12]). Let Ω be a convex body in Rm. For α ≤ 1, the potential V (α)
strictly concave on Ω. In particular, Ω has a unique rα−m-center.

2.3 Properties of the solid angle function AΩ
Let Ω be the closure of an open set in Rm. We consider the solid angle of Ω at (x, h) ∈ Rm × (0, +∞).
From its deﬁnition mentioned in the introduction, we can show the following properties:

ARm (x, h) =

h→0+

AΩ(x, h) =

, x ∈ Rm, h > 0,
χΩ(x), x ∈ Rm \ ∂Ω.

(2.5)

(2.6)

In [19, 20], the author investigated properties of the solid angle function AΩ. Let us prepare some

terminologies and properties of AΩ from [19].

Since the integrand of AΩ is strictly decreasing with respect to |x − ξ|, for any point p in the com-
plement of the convex hull of Ω, taking a point p′ on the boundary of the convex hull of Ω with
|p − p′| = dist(p, (conv Ω)c), we obtain AΩ(p, h) < AΩ(p′, h). Hence the continuity of AΩ(·, h) imply
the existence of a maximizer of AΩ(·, h) if Ω is compact.
Proposition 2.14 ([19, Proposition 5.16]). Let Ω be a body in Rm. For any h > 0, the solid angle
function AΩ(·, h) has a maximizer, and all of them are contained in the convex hull of Ω.
Deﬁnition 2.15 ([19, Deﬁnition 5.23]). Let Ω be a body in Rm. A point c is called an illuminating
center of Ω of height h if it gives the maximum value of AΩ(·, h). Let us denote the set of illuminating
centers by AΩ(h), that is,

The derivative of AΩ(·, h) vanishes at a point x if and only if the point x satisﬁes the equation

AΩ(c, h) = max

(2.7)

which tells us the limiting point of an illuminating center of height h as h goes to inﬁnity.

Proposition 2.16 ([19, Proposition 5.19]). Let Ω be a body in Rm. The set of illuminating centers
converges to the one-point set of the centroid of Ω as h goes to inﬁnity with respect to the Hausdorﬀ
distance.

The small-height behavior of illuminating centers will be investigated in Theorem 5.8.

2.4 Properties of a potential with a radially symmetric kernel

Let Ω be a body (the closure of a bounded open set) in Rm. We consider a potential of the form

KΩ(x) =ZΩ

k (|x − ξ|) dξ, x ∈ Rm.

(2.8)

We understand that the kernel k satisﬁes the condition (C0
interval (0, +∞), and if

as r tends to 0+.

In [19], the author investigated properties of the potential KΩ. Let us prepare some terminologies

and properties of KΩ from [19].

Let ψ be a smooth function so that ψ(r) = 0 if 0 ≤ r ≤ 1, 0 ≤ ψ′(r) ≤ 2 if 1 ≤ r ≤ 2, and ψ(r) = 1 if

(2.10)

is continuous and converges to KΩ uniformly on Rm as ε tends to 0+. Thus, we obtain the continuity of
KΩ.

Proposition 2.17 ([19, Proposition 2.3]). Let Ω be a body in Rm. If k satisﬁes the condition (C0
some β > 0, then the potential KΩ is continuous on Rm.

β) for

In the same manner as Proposition 2.14, we can show the existence of a maximizer of KΩ.

Proposition 2.18 ([19, Proposition 3.2]). Let Ω be a body in Rm. If k is strictly decreasing and satisﬁes
the condition (C0
β) for some β > 0, then the potential KΩ has a maximizer, and all of them are contained
in the convex hull of Ω.

Deﬁnition 2.19 ([19, Deﬁnition 3.3]). Let Ω be a body in Rm. A point c is called a k-center of Ω if it
gives the maximum value of KΩ. We denote the set of k-centers of Ω by KΩ, that is,

KΩ =(cid:26)c ∈ Rm(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

KΩ(c) = max
x∈Rm

KΩ(x)(cid:27) .

For the potential KΩ(x, t) deﬁned in (1.1), we call a maximizer of KΩ(·, t) a k-center at time t.
Proposition 2.20. Let Ω be a convex body in Rm. Let Ω′ be a convex body contained in the interior of
Ω. Put

d(Ω, Ω′) = inf {|z − w| |z ∈ ∂Ω, w ∈ Ω′} , D(Ω, Ω′) = sup{|z − w| |z ∈ ∂Ω, w ∈ Ω′} .

Let k be positive and satisfy the condition (C0
[d(Ω, Ω′), D(Ω, Ω′)], then KΩ is strictly concave in Ω′.

2.5 The minimal unfolded region of a body

Let Ω be a body (the closure of a bounded open set) in Rm. Using the radial symmetry of the kernels of
the potentials mentioned in the previous subsections, we can restrict the region containing those centers.
We introduce the restricted region and its properties from [2, 17, 19] (see also [1, 18, 20]).

Deﬁnition 2.21 ([17, Deﬁnition 3.3]). Let v be a direction in the unit sphere Sm−1, and b a real
parameter. Let Reﬂv,b be the reﬂection of Rm in the hyperplane {z ∈ Rm|z · v = b}. Put
v,b(cid:17) ⊂ Ωo

v,b = Ω ∩ {z ∈ Rm| z · v ≥ b} , l(v) = minna ∈ R(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)∀b ≥ a, Reﬂv,b(cid:16)Ω+

(see Figure 2). Deﬁne the minimal unfolded region of Ω by

Ω+

U f (Ω) = \v∈Sm−1 {z ∈ Rm| z · v ≤ l(v)} .

Example 2.22 ([2, Lemma 5], [17, Example 3.4]).

(1) The minimal unfolded region of the disjoint

union of three discs is surrounded by the lines through two centers of discs (see Figure 3).

(2) The minimal unfolded region of an acute triangle is surrounded by the mid-perpendiculars of edges

and the bisectors of angles (see Figure 4).

(3) The minimal unfolded region of an obtuse triangle is surrounded by the largest edge, its midper-
pendicular and the bisectors of angles (see Figure5). We remark that the minimal unfolded region
of Ω is not always contained in the interior of the convex hull of Ω even if Ω is convex.

Remark 2.23 ([2, Proposition 1], [17, p. 381]).

(1) The centroid (center of mass) of Ω is contained in

U f (Ω). Hence U f (Ω) is not empty.

(2) U f (Ω) is compact and convex.

(3) U f (Ω) is contained in the convex hull of Ω.

Using the moving plane method ([5, 21]), we can restrict the location of the centers prepared in the

previous subsections.
Proposition 2.24. Let Ω be a body in Rm. For α ≤ 0, any rα−m-center of Ω belongs to the minimal
unfolded region of Ω.

Proof. Let x be an interior point of Ω in the complement of the minimal unfolded region of Ω. We show
that the point x is not an rα−m-center of Ω.

We can choose a direction v ∈ Sm−1 with l(v) < x · v. Let b = (l(v) + x · v)/2. Then, the region

Reﬂv,b(Ω+

v,b) is contained in Ω, and Ω \ (Ω+

v,b ∪ Reﬂv,b(Ω+

v,b)) has an interior point.

which completes the proof.

Remark 2.25. In [17, Theorem 3.5], O’Hara asserted the same statement as Proposition 2.24 when Ω
has a piecewise C1 boundary. But, in this paper, we does not assume the smoothness of a body Ω.

In the same manner as in Proposition 2.24, we can restrict the location of k-centers of Ω into the

minimal unfolded region of Ω.

Proposition 2.26 ([19, Proposition 4.9]). Let Ω be a body in Rm. If k is strictly decreasing and satisﬁes
the condition (C0
β) for some β > 0, then any k-center of Ω belongs to the minimal unfolded region of Ω.

Remark 2.27. We refer to [8] for the location of rα−m-centers. Herburt showed that the (unique)
r1−m-center of a smooth convex body A belongs to the interior of A.

For α ≤ 0, we discuss the location of rα−m-centers in Theorem 3.3 and Corollary 3.4. For α > 1, any
rα−m-center of a body Ω belongs to the intersection U f (Ω)∩ (conv Ω)◦. This statement follows from the

11

fact that, for a boundary point x of conv Ω and the unit outer normal ﬁeld n of conv Ω, the derivative

∂V (α)
∂n(x)

Ω

(x) = (α − m)ZΩ

rα−m−2(x − y) · n(x)dy

does not vanish.

Herburt’s theorem does not follow from the same argument as in the case of α > 1. This is because
Ω is not diﬀerentiable at any boundary point of Ω. Also, the minimal unfolded region of

the potential V (1)
Ω touches the boundary of Ω in general (see Example 2.22).

Hence, for 0 < α < 1, the location of rα−m-centers is unknown.

3 Estimation of an rα−m-potential

Let Ω be a body (the closure of a bonded open set) in Rm. By Proposition 2.24, the set of rα−m-centers
(α ≤ 0) of Ω is contained in the minimal unfolded region of Ω. But, by Lemma 2.9, it is expected that
any rα−m-center does not exist “near” the boundary of Ω. For example, when Ω is an obtuse triangle in
R2, the minimal unfolded region of Ω touches the boundary of Ω, but it is expected that any rα−2-center
belongs to a smaller closed region contained in the interior of the minimal unfolded region of Ω. Let us
show that the expectation is true when the complement of Ω satisﬁes the uniform boundary inner cone
condition.

Let C(x) = C(x; κ, δ) be an open cone of vertex x, axis direction e1, aperture angle 0 < κ ≤ π and

height 0 < δ ≤ +∞, that is,

In order to complete the proof, we prepare the following notation:

Uθ = Rot1m(θ) (C (Re1) ∩ BD(0) ∩ {ξm ≥ 0} − Re1) + Re1,
Lθ = Rot1m(θ) (C (Re1) ∩ BD(0) ∩ {ξm ≤ 0} − Re1) + Re1.

The non-negativity of the diﬀerence ∆(θ, φ) implies

(cid:18)ZL0 −ZLθ(cid:19)|ξ|α−m dξ ≤(cid:18)ZUθ −ZU0(cid:19)|ξ|α−m dξ,

13

and hence, we get

ZC(Re1)∩BD (0) |ξ|α−m dξ =ZU0∪L0 |ξ|α−m dξ ≤ZUθ∪Lθ |ξ|α−m dξ.

If δ ≤ D − R, then Cθ(Re1) = Cθ(Re1) ∩ BD(0) = Uθ ∪ Lθ, that is, the proof is completed in this

case. Let us consider the case of δ ≥ √D2 − R2. Using the non-negativity of ∆(θ, φ), we can show

Vol ((Uθ ∪ Lθ) \ (Cθ (Re1) ∩ BD(0))) ≤ Vol ((Cθ (Re1) ∩ BD(0)) \ (Uθ ∪ Lθ))

(see Figure 7). Hence we obtain

ZUθ ∪Lθ |ξ|α−m dξ ≤ZCθ(Re1)∩BD (0) |ξ|α−m dξ,

which completes the proof .

Lemma 3.2. Let α ≤ 0, 0 < κ ≤ π, 0 < δ ≤ +∞, D > 0, and 0 < R0 < D. Deﬁne the function
0≤θ≤(π−κ)/2 ZCθ(Re1)∩BD (0) −ZBD (0)\BR0 (0)!|ξ|α−m dξ, R > 0,

E(R) = E (R; α, κ, δ, D, R0) =

min

where Cθ(Re1) = Cθ(Re1; κ, δ) is the cone deﬁned in (3.3).

(1) The function E is strictly decreasing.

(2) There exists a unique positive constant ˜R = ˜R(α, κ, δ, D, R0) such that E(R) > 0 if R < ˜R, and that

E(R) < 0 if R > ˜R. In particular, ˜R is the unique zero point of E.

(3) The unique zero point ˜R is less than R0.

Proof. (1) Let 0 < R1 < R2. We denote by θj an angle giving the minimum value in the deﬁnition of

14

E(Rj ). The strictly decreasing behavior of the function r 7→ rα−m implies

E (R1) = ZCθ1 (R1e1)∩BD(0) −ZBD (0)\BR0 (0)! |ξ|α−m dξ
> ZCθ1 (R2e1)∩BD(0) −ZBD (0)\BR0 (0)! |ξ|α−m dξ
≥ ZCθ2 (R2e1)∩BD(0) −ZBD (0)\BR0 (0)! |ξ|α−m dξ

= E (R2) .

(2) First, we remark that E(R) is negative for R ≥ R0. This is because, for any 0 ≤ θ ≤ (π − κ)/2
and R ≥ R0, Cθ (Re1) ∩ BD(0) is contained in the annulus BD(0) \ BR0 (0).
Next, we show that E(R) diverges to +∞ as R → 0+. We take a small enough ε > 0 so that
εδ < D − R0. Then, for any 0 ≤ θ ≤ (π − κ)/2 and R ≤ R0, the small cone εCθ(Re1) is contained in the
ball BD(0). From Lemma 3.1, we have

Therefore, Lemma 2.9 implies

min

0≤θ≤(π−κ)/2ZεCθ (Re1)∩BD (0) |ξ|α−m dξ =ZεC(Re1)∩BD (0) |ξ|α−m dξ.
E(R) ≥ ZεC(Re1)∩BD (0) −ZBD (0)\BR0 (0)!|ξ|α−m dξ → +∞

as R → 0+.

Hence the continuity of E implies the existence and uniqueness of a zero point of E.
(3) The statement was shown in the proof of (2) as E(R) is negative for R ≥ R0.

Theorem 3.3. Let α ≤ 0. Let X and Y be bodies in Rm. Suppose that the complement of Y satisﬁes
the uniform boundary inner cone condition of aperture angle κ and height δ. Let R0 > 0, and ˜R =
˜R(α, κ, δ, diam Y, R0) be as in Lemma 3.2. For any points x ∈ X with dist(x, X c) ≥ R0 and y ∈ Y with
dist(y, Y c) ≤ ˜R, we have V (α)
Proof. If R0 is greater than half of the diameter of Y , then the statement obviously hods. Let us consider
the case where R0 is not greater than half of the diameter of Y .

(y) < V (α)

X (x).

Fix an interior point y of Y . Let y′ be a boundary point of Y with |y − y′| = dist(y, Y c). From the
uniform boundary inner cone condition of the complement of Y , there is a direction v(y) such that we
can take an open cone of vertex y′, axis direction v(y), aperture angle κ and height δ. Let θ(y) be the
angle between (y′ − y)/|y′ − y| and v(y). By radial symmetry of the kernel of V (α)

Corollary 3.4. Let α ≤ 0. Let Ω be a body in Rm whose complement satisﬁes the uniform boundary
inner cone condition of aperture angle κ and height δ. Any rα−m-center of Ω belongs to the intersection

We take an open cone C of aperture angle κ and height δ such that the complement of Ω0 satisﬁes
the uniform interior cone condition for C. Then, for any 0 < ε ≤ 1, the complement of the body Ωε
satisﬁes the uniform interior cone condition for C. We remark diam Ωε = 2√10 and R∞(Ωε) = 1 for any

Since U f (Ω) = [−2, 2] × {0}m−1 and ˜R < 1, Corollary 3.4 implies that any rα−m-center of the body

4 Estimation of a potential with a summable kernel

Let Ω be a body (the closure of a bounded open set) in Rm. In this section, we estimate a potential of
the form

K (α)

Ω (x, t) =ZΩ

kα (|x − ξ| , t) dξ, x ∈ Rm, t > 0.

(4.1)

Assumption 4.1. For the kernel kα in (4.1), we assume some or all of the following conditions:
(1) kα(·, t) is strictly decreasing and satisﬁes the condition (C0
(2) We can choose a pair of positive functions (ψ, ¯kα) such that the kernel kα is expressed as k(r, t) =

β) for some β > 0.

ψ(t)¯kα(r, t), and that ¯kα(r, t) converges to rα−m for each positive r as t tends to 0+.

(3) For each positive t, we have

(4) For any positive ρ, we have

ZRm

kα (|ξ| , t) dξ = 1.

lim

t→0+ZRm\Bρ(0)

Usually, a radially symmetric non-negative kernel is said to be summable if it satisﬁes the conditions (3)
and (4).

X and Y be bodies in Rm. Suppose that the complement of Y satisﬁes the uniform boundary inner cone
condition of aperture angle κ and height δ. Let R0 > 0, and ˜R = ˜R(α, κ, δ, diam Y, R0) be given in Lemma
3.2. For any 0 < b < 1, there exists a positive τ1 such that if 0 < t < τ1, then, for any x ∈ X with
dist(x, X c) ≥ R0 and y ∈ Y with (b/2) ˜R ≤ dist(y, Y c) ≤ b ˜R, we have K (α)
Proof. If R0 is greater than half of the diameter of Y , then the statement obviously holds. Let us assume
that R0 is not greater than half of the diameter of Y .

Y (y, t) < K (α)

Thanks to the uniform boundary inner cone condition of the complement of Y , in the same manner
as in Theorem 3.3, for any point y ∈ Y , we can choose a constant 0 ≤ θ(y) ≤ (π − κ)/2 such that, for

By the assumption for the kernel kα and the compactness of the body Y , there exits a positive constant
τ1 such that if 0 < t < τ1, then, for any ξ ∈ (C((b/2) ˜Re1; π, +∞) ∩ Bdiam Y (0)) ∪ (Bdiam Y (0) \ BR0(0)),

Theorem 4.7. Let α ≤ 0. Suppose that kα satisﬁes all the conditions in Assumption 4.1. Let X and
Y be bodies in Rm. Suppose that the complement of Y satisﬁes the uniform interior cone condition of
aperture angle κ and height δ. Let R0 > 0, and ˜R = ˜R(α, κ, δ, diam Y, R0) be given in Lemma 3.2. For
any 0 < b < 1, there exists a positive τ such that if 0 < t < τ , then, for any x ∈ X with dist(x, X c) ≥ R0
and y ∈ Rm with dist(y, Y c) ≤ b ˜R, we have K (α)

Y (y, t) < K (α)

X (x, t).

Proof. Thanks to Lemma 2.3, the complement of Y satisﬁes the uniform boundary inner cone condition
of aperture angle κ and height δ. Let τ1 and τ2 be as in Propositions 4.4 and 4.6, respectively. Taking
τ = min{τ1, τ2}, we obtain the conclusion.
Corollary 4.8. Let α ≤ 0 and kα be as in Theorem 4.7. Let Ω be a body in Rm whose complement satisﬁes
the uniform interior cone condition of aperture angle κ and height δ. Let ˜R = ˜R(α, κ, δ, diam Ω, R∞(Ω))
be given in Lemma 3.2. For any 0 < b < 1, there exits a positive constant τ such that if 0 < t < τ , then
any kα-center of Ω at time t is contained in the intersection (Ω ∼ b ˜RBm) ∩ U f (Ω).
Proof. Thanks to Proposition 2.26, all the kα-centers are contained in the minimal unfolded region of Ω.
Hence, combining Theorem 4.7, we obtain the conclusion.

Example 4.9. Let α ≤ 0. Suppose that kα satisﬁes all the conditions in Assumption 4.1. Let ε, Ωε, C

˜R(α, π, +∞, diam Ω, R∞(Ω)) be given in Lemma 3.2. Let 0 < b < 1, and Ω′ = (Ω ∼ b ˜RBm) ∩ U f (Ω).
Suppose the existence of a positive constant τ ′ such that, for any 0 < t < τ ′, kα(r, t)rm−1 is decreasing
on the interval [d(Ω, Ω′), D(Ω, Ω′)] with respect to r. There exists a positive constant τ ≤ τ ′ such that,
for any 0 < t < τ , K (α)
Ω (·, t) is strictly concave on Ω′. In particular, Ω has a unique kα-center at time
0 < t < τ .
Proof. Since (Ω ∼ b ˜RBm) ∩ U f (Ω) is convex and contained in the interior of Ω, Propositions 2.20
guarantees the conclusion.

Theorem 4.12. Let α ≤ 0. Suppose that kα satisﬁes all the conditions in Assumption 4.1. Let Ω be
a body in Rm whose complement satisﬁes the uniform interior cone condition of aperture angle κ and
height δ. For any decreasing sequence {tℓ} with zero limiting value and any kα-center cα(tℓ) at time tℓ,
the distance between cα(tℓ) and the set of rα−m-centers tends to zero as ℓ goes to +∞.
Proof. Thanks to Corollary 4.8, we may assume that any kα-center at time tℓ belongs to the inner-parallel
body of Ω of radius (1/2) ˜R, where ˜R = ˜R(α, κ, δ, diam Ω, R∞(Ω)) is given in Lemma 3.2. Since the inner-
parallel body is compact, without loss of generality, we assume that {cα(tℓ)} converges to a point cα.
In order to show that cα is an rα−m-center of Ω, we assume that cα is not any rα−m-center, and let us
derive a contradiction.

Proof. Theorem 2.13 guarantees the uniqueness of an rα−m-center of Ω. Hence Theorem 4.12 implies the
conclusion.

5 Applications to the Poisson integral

Let Ω be a body (the closure of a bounded open set) in Rm. In this section, we apply the results in
the previous section to the Poisson integral for the upper half-space. In other words, we consider the

x ∈ X with dist(x, X c) ≥ R0 and y ∈ Rm with dist(y, Y c) ≤ b ˜R, we have AY (y, h) < AX (x, h).

0 < b < 1, there exists a positive h0 such that, for any 0 < h < h0, any illuminating center of Ω of height
h is contained in the intersection (Ω ∼ b ˜RBm) ∩ U f (Ω).

terval has an illuminating center. In particular, the Poisson integral PΩε (·, h) has at least two maximizers

Poisson kernel guarantees the existence of a positive constant 1 + ˜R ≤ ρ(h) ≤ 2 such that the set of
illuminating centers of Ω of height h contains the sphere ρ(h)Sm−1 for any suﬃciently small h.
Corollary 5.7. Let Ω be a convex body in Rm. Let ˜R = ˜R(−1, π, +∞, diam Ω, R∞(Ω)) be given in

that, for any 0 < h < h0, the Poisson integral PΩ(·, h) is strictly concave on Ω′. In particular, Ω has a
unique illuminating center of height 0 < h < h0.
Proof. We can directly show that if h ≤p(m − 1)/2d(Ω, Ω′), then the function r 7→ (r2+h2)−(m+1)/2rm−1
is decreasing for d(Ω, Ω′) ≤ r ≤ D(Ω, Ω′). Let h′
0 = sup{h > 0|AΩ(h′) ⊂ Ω′ ∀h′ < h}. Taking
h0 = min{p(m − 1)/2d(Ω, Ω′), h′
