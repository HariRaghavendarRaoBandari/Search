Numerical calculations of excitonic properties of novel nanostructures, such as nanowire and
crystal phase quantum dots, must combine atomistic accuracy with an approachable computational
complexity. The key diﬃculty comes from the fact that excitonic spectra details arise from atomic-
scale contributions that must be integrated over a large spatial domain containing a million and
more of atoms. In this work we present a step-by-step solution to this problem: combined empirical
tight-binding and conﬁguration interaction scheme that unites linearly scaling computational time
with the essentials of the atomistic modeling. We benchmark our method on the example of well-
studied self-assembled InAs/GaAs quantum dot. Next, we apply our atomistic approach to crystal
phase quantum dots containing more than 10 million atoms.

Accurate calculations of excitonic properties of semi-
conductor quantum dots1 must fulﬁll two apparently con-
tradictory conditions. The ﬁrst constraint is the neces-
sity of handling computational domains containing mil-
lions of atoms.2,3 The second requirement is the atom-
istic accuracy necessary for the accurate description of
the excitonic spectra.4–7 First principles modeling such
as the density functional theory8 or GW-Bethe-Salpeter-
equation approach9 for self-assembled10 or nanowire11
quantum dots is still beyond the reach of modern com-
puters. Continuous matter approaches like the eﬀective
mass approximation or k · p method12,13 have demon-
strated the capability of describing main features in QDs
spectra;10,14 however, these methods are restricted by the
resolution on the scale of a unit cell.15 One of the key ex-
amples is the bright exciton splitting,16–18 where sophis-
ticated multi-band approaches are needed to accommo-
date for the correct symmetry of the underlying crystal
lattice.19–22 Apart from symmetry issues, even the most
elaborate continuous matter tactics cannot fully account
for eﬀects of alloying,3 lattice randomness,23, interface
eﬀects,24,25 or crystal phase symmetry26,27 for which a
truly atomistic approach is needed.

Practical methods,

capturing atomistic structure
in-
of quantum dots and their surrounding matrix,
clude two semi-empirical approaches:
the empirical
tight-binding28–35 and the empirical pseudopotential
method.36–38 Typical calculations using these approxi-
mate approaches involve three subsequent stages:39–42 a)
calculation of equilibrium position of constituent atoms,
b) calculation of quasielectron and quasihole states, and
c) inclusion of excited quasiparticles interactions via
screened Coulomb potential, solved by some sort of con-
ﬁguration interaction (exact diagonalization) method.

Although the stages of ﬁnding positions (strains) and
quasi-particle calculations are often far from trivial, the
key computational issue for approaches aiming to quan-
titatively describe nanosystem spectra is the ultimate
step: the many-body calculation. This part of calcula-
tion is of particular importance as in a typical quantum
dot photoluminescence experiment one does not observe

the single-particle spectra, but rather many-body spec-
tra of charged and neutral (multi-) excitonic complexes.1
Therefore in a realistic calculation the single particle part
of the computation must be followed by a many-body
calculation. Similarly to post-Hartree-Fock methods of
quantum chemistry,43 the many-body calculation follow-
ing the single-particle part is often the most time de-
manding stage of the entire empirical computations se-
quence. In particular, as a necessary prerequisite for the
many-body calculation typically numerous two-particle
integrals must be ﬁrst calculated using quasiparticle func-
tions. In the tight-binding (TB) approach, for N atoms,
A basis functions per atom, and M quasiparticle states
there are O(N 4A4M 4) two-particle integrals, and the
computational eﬀort will thus formally scale as the fourth
power in number of atoms, what leads to a practically un-
tractable problem for typical quantum dots with numbers
of atoms exceeding a million.

In this paper we present an approximated method for
eﬃcient order-N calculation of screened Coulomb and
exchange integrals within the tight-binding framework.
Apart from linear scaling our method accounts for terms
that are customarily neglected in a typical tight-binding
calculation of Coulomb matrix elements. We test our ap-
proach on the example of million-atom InAs/GaAs lens-
shape self-assembled quantum dots and ﬁnally apply our
approach to multi-million-atom crystal phase quantum
dots.

I. COULOMB MATRIX ELEMENTS

At the moment one of the most successful empirical
computational procedures is the empirical pseudopoten-
tial method.36,39 This approach uses “realistic” empir-
ical pseudopotentials that reproduce correct band gaps
and eﬀective masses. Those potentials can be accom-
modated with a relatively small plane wave basis set
and are used to obtain the single-particle eigenvectors
as solution of the Schr¨odinger equation with an auxil-
iary basis set of strained Bloch function of the under-

lying bulk.44 Whereas conceptually straightforward, the
practical implementation of the empirical pseudopoten-
tial method for quantum dots has been so far limited only
to A. Zunger and co-workers.

On the contrary, numerous theoretical groups utilize
diﬀerent ﬂavors of the empirical tight-binding method.
The latter approach origins from the Slater-Koster
scheme of orthogonal tight-binding,45 whereas Hamilto-
nian matrix elements are given in terms of several empir-
ical constants46 determined to reproduce bulk properties
such as eﬀective masses, bulk deformation potentials and
gaps at diﬀerent points of the Brillouin zone.47 Fitting
process is usually far from trivial48; however, for a wide
family of materials, there are reliable and accurate tight-
binding parameter sets available in the literature.47–52

The

tight-binding method applied to a typical
nanowire or self-assembled quantum dot problem pro-
duces a Hamiltonian matrices of dimensions extending
106; however, due to the nearest-neighbors approxima-
tion the Hamiltonian matrix is sparse. Then, for se-
lected single particle states (close to energy band gap) the
eigenproblem can be solved eﬃciently using e.g. Krylov
iterative methods, such as Lanczos53 or Arnoldi54 algo-
rithm, therefore resulting in a linear scaling of compu-
tational time with respect to the number of atoms in
a computational domain. Like many other numerical
approaches the empirical tight-binding beneﬁts consid-
erably from the parallelization that further reduces the
overall computation time.3

The tight-binding or linear combination of atomic or-

bitals (LCAO) wave function is given as:

ψ(~r) =

N

A

X~R

Xα

b ~Rα(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
~RαE =

N

A

X~R

Xα

b ~Rαφ ~Rα(~r − ~R) (1)

where the summation goes over all (N ) atoms ~R and
all (A) over atomic orbitals α centered on a given atom,
whereas b ~Rα are basis expansion coeﬃcients. Assuming
a statically screened9 Coulomb interaction, the Coulomb
matrix elements Vijkl are given by:33

Vijkl =Z Z ψ∗

ǫ( ~r1, ~r2) | ~r1 − ~r2|

ψk( ~r2)ψl( ~r1)

(2)

is an integral calculated in a basis of tight-binding

(“atomic”) orbitals.

If treated directly, this procedure would result in
O(N 4A4)
terms (atomic integrals) constituting one
quasi-particle Coulomb matrix element, where N is the
number of atoms in the domain (typically N ∼ 106 for
self-assembled and nanowire quantum dots) and A is
number of (spin-)orbitals associated with each of atoms
(e.g. 20 for the sp3d5s⋆ TB model34). To further compli-
cate matters, practical calculation demands computation
not of one, but numerous electron-electron, hole-hole,
and electron-hole Coulomb matrix elements calculated
using Eq. 3. For example, in a typical quantum dot cal-
culation involving 12 electron states and 12 hole states
(including spin), the total number of these quasi-particle
Coulomb matrix elements reaches 105, whereas in certain
situations22 number of quasi-particle states (M ) used for
the calculation must be further extended. Either way,
the overall computation time scales as O(N 4A4M 4).

Typically, this formidable problem is resolved by uti-
lizing a series of approximations,32,33 including neglect of
three- and four-center integrals ω.29 Further approxima-
tions involve multi-pole expansion of single integral ω and
retaining monopole-monopole contributions only.32,33

Finally one gets an approximate form of Coulomb ma-

trix elements:33

where the ﬁrst term is the long-range, bulk-screened,
contribution to the two-center integral built from the
monopole-monopole interaction55,56 of two charge den-
sities localized at diﬀerent atomic sites. The second term
is the on-site unscreened part, calculated by direct inte-
gration using atomic orbitals.28,29 This approach is justi-
ﬁed by the fact that the screening (Thomas-Fermi) radius
(≈ 2–4 ˚A) is on the order of a bond length15,29 result-
ing in nearly bulk screening of oﬀ-site (long-range) terms
and limited screening of on-site (short-range) terms con-
tribution. A potential problem arising here is the choice
of atomic basis used for calculation of ω on-site integrals.
The generally important matter of basis dependence will
be discussed later in more detail.

tion and ψ’s are single-particle, electron or hole, wave

The second summation in Eq. 5 over on-site terms can
be further simpliﬁed by neglecting exchange terms and

Whereas relatively uncomplicated, Eq. 5 and Eq. 6 give
reasonable agreement with the experiment and other
computational approaches.32,34,35 The above procedures
(Eq. 5 and Eq. 6) give also far more approachable O(N 2)
scaling of a single Coulomb matrix element calculation
rather than impractical O(N 4) of the straightforward
method (Eq. 3). Further reduction of the computational
time (but not the scaling factor) can be achieved by utiliz-
ing multi-scale57 approaches (i.e. using smaller domains
at diﬀerent stages of the computation). While not aﬀect-
ing the scaling properties, the usage of numerical libraries
such as BLAS can further reduce the computation time
by avoiding time consuming recalculation40 of interme-
diate terms.

Apart from the advantages, the above methods (Eq. 5
and Eq. 6) reveal two apparent issues. The ﬁrst is a
non-linear O(N 2) scaling of the computational time lead-
ing to exploding computational complexity for domains
containing millions of atoms. The second problem is
an possible inaccuracy related to the two-center and the
monopole-monopole approximations.

II. WAVE-FUNCTION RECONSTRUCTION

In what follows we present a numerical method that
eﬀectively addresses above issues. Let us starts by reiter-
ating that the LCAO representation of the tight-binding
wavefunction leads to a non-linear scaling of the two-
particle Coulomb matrix elements calculation with re-
spect to the number of atoms in the domain. There-
fore, after TB stage of calculation, we convert TB eigen-
states from a typical LCAO wave-functions to a real-
space tight-binding wave-function representations. This
stage is achieved by an introduction of a three dimen-
sional, uniform real-space grid with complex values. At
each point of the spatial grid we use Eq. 1 (assuming par-
ticular basis set) to calculate the wave-function values.
We repeat this procedure and process in this way each
of several lowest electron and hole functions obtained by
the tight-binding procedure, obtaining the real space grid
representation for each of the considered functions. The
resolution of the grid, common for all functions, is de-
termined by convergence studies and will be discussed
later. We denote this stage of calculation as the “wave-
function grid reconstruction” or simply “wave-function
reconstruction”. The beneﬁts of this transformation will
become apparent soon. Later we will discuss in detail the
eﬀect of the basis choice used in Eq. 1.

The computational cost of the straightforward single
wave-function reconstruction using Eq. 1 is proportional
to number of atoms N and the number of grid points
P resulting in O(N P ) computation time for the sin-
gle quasi-particle function reconstruction. For accurate
computations and high grid resolution, P should clearly
be proportional (even exceeding) than N leading to the
unfavorable O(N 2) scaling at this stage of calculation.
However, let us notice that in an orthogonal tight-binding

3

method it is legitimate to assume that for any point in
space ~r the value of the tight-binding wave-function ψ can
be replaced by a contribution from several atomic neigh-
bors only lying within a certain “cut-oﬀ” radius Rcut:

ψ (~r) =

N

A

X~R

Xα

b ~Rαφ ~Rα(~r − ~R)

A

≈ X|~r− ~R|<Rcut

Xα

b ~Rαφ ~Rα(~r − ~R)

(7)

More strictly, rather than due to orthogonality, this as-
sumption originates from atomic orbitals spatial local-
ity, i.e. relatively small spatial extent of atomic orbitals
when compared to dimensions of the entire system. Sim-
ilar assumptions are typically utilized in the context of
other linear-scaling approaches,58 that rely heavily on the
use of strictly conﬁned basis orbitals, i.e. orbitals zero-
ing beyond a certain radius. One way of achieving this
goal is the method of Sankey and Niklewski59 where the
(pseudo-) atom is embedded within a spherical box of
ﬁnite radius.

Should Rcut be much smaller then the system size then
the number of atoms (Ncut) within the cut-oﬀ radius:
Ncut ≪ N . More importantly, for quantum dots embed-
ded in bulk-like matrix, Ncut should be relatively con-
stant and independent from N , leading to O(N ) scaling
of the tight-binding wave-function reconstruction time.

A straightforward implementation of Eq. 7 would in-
volve iteration over grid points and therefore implicitly
perform costly calculations of distances between all grid
points and all atoms. Instead, in our implementation, we
iterate over all atoms and update only grid points within
a neighborhood deﬁned as a cube of edge length equal to
2Rcut. This procedure can also be eﬃciently parallelized.
In case of semiconductor quantum dots above assump-
tions and exact value of Rcut will be veriﬁed later by nu-
merical tests. The size of the reconstruction grid should
be equal to spatial system dimensions increased in all
directions by necessary margins equal to Rcut. We also
note that we separately compute and store spin-up and
spin-down wave-function components at each grid point.
Once the reconstruction is ﬁnished, the wave-function is
ﬁnally renormalized on the grid.

With the TB wave-function given in real-space we can
follow with the calculation of Coulomb matrix elements
using Eq. 2. Straightforward substitution of real-space
wave-functions into Eq. 2 and direct integration would
however lead to O(P 2) ∝ O(N 2) complexity. Fortu-
nately, this equation be conveniently evaluated in the
reciprocal space. Eq. 2 can be cast in a general form:60

Vijkl =Z Z ρil(~r) G(~r − ~r′) ρjk(~r′) dV dV ′,

(8)

where ρil = ψi∗ψl, ρjk = ψj∗ψk and G(~r − ~r′) is the
screened Coulomb interaction. Then, potential Vjk cal-

4

culated from quasi-density ρjk is given as:

Vjk(~r) =Z G(~r − ~r′) ρjk(~r′) dV ′

(9)

For a discrete case, assuming regular grid with the grid
step h, we obtain:

Vjk[~r] =X~r′

G[~r − ~r′] ρjk[~r′] h3 = (G ∗ ρjk)[~r] h3

(10)

where ~r and ~r′ are points on a discrete grid and (G ∗ ρjk)
is a full convolution between quasidensity ρjk and the
screened Coulomb interaction G(~r − ~r′), which is deﬁned
on a three-dimensional domain twice as large as ρjk (as
it includes both positive and negative shifts) in every di-
mension. Therefore, the density grid must also be padded
with zeros, resulting in 8P grid points instead of P . Due
to this padding, the full convolution (G ∗ ρjk) is equiva-
lent to the circular convolution, which in turn can be ef-
fectively computed using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
algorithm61 in O(P log P ) time.

Since we use FFT purely as a computational tool to
calculate full (not circular) convolution, we do not intro-
duce any undesired periodicity to the problem. Details of
this approach are given e.g. in Ref.62. This technique is a
standard in digital signal processing for a discrete Fourier
transform treatment of non-periodic signals convoluted
with a response function of a ﬁnite duration. Otherwise,
Eq. 10 would typically converge slowly with respect to
the grid (supercell) volume. Diﬀerent techniques includ-
ing multi-pole expansion60,63,64 or truncated Coulomb
interaction64 would be typically necessary to speed up
this convergence.

The method we utilize seems not to be often used in
the electronic structure calculation, most likely due to
the increased memory demand. In our case the size of the
FFT domain is eﬀectively doubled in all three directions.
As a practical beneﬁt, we do not need to perform con-
vergence tests with respect to the domain size as Eq. 11
gives exactly the same results as the direct integration of
Eq. 2. In the latter part of the text we will additionally
verify that statement by performing numerical tests of
the eﬀective range of the Coulomb interaction. We also
note that in other approaches the size of the supercell is
often much larger then the actual system size.64 More-
over, extending the FFT domain is not aﬀecting the time
needed for the wave-function reconstruction, but only the
(relatively short) time of the FFT calculation.

Vijkl is ﬁnally given as a straightforward O(P ) ∝ O(N )

summation over all grid points:

ρil[~r] Vjk[~r]h3

(11)

Vijkl =X~r

For a given jk pair of tight-binding (grid recon-
structed) functions, Vjk and the FFT transform are cal-
culated only once and are used to calculate all resulting
Coulomb matrix elements Vijkl, therefore avoiding costly
recalculation of Vjk.

Our approach accounts for dielectric eﬀects at diﬀer-
ent levels of approximation. For example, we can use
any form of distance dependent dielectric function, e.g.
a Thomas-Fermi model of Resta65 customarily utilized
in the empirical-pseudopotential method calculations.64
Apart from the distance-dependence, we can account for
the spatial dependence of the dielectric medium. Details
of this latter approach will be discussed elsewhere.
In
the current paper G is either taken as a Fourier trans-
form of Coulomb bulk-screened interaction or is given by
a Thomas-Fermi model of Resta.65 Finally, we note that
due to introduction of large spatial grid our method de-
mands substantially larger computer memory than the
simple model (Eq. 5).

III. LATTICE AND THE SINGLE PARTICLE

SPECTRA

As discussed in the introduction, the calculation con-
sists of several major steps: ﬁrst atomic positions are
calculated. For lattice mismatched system (such as
InAs/GaAs quantum dots) to calculate strain relaxed po-
sitions we use the atomistic valence force ﬁeld (VFF) ap-
proach of Keating.66,67 This method is described in more
detail in Ref.68,69 and in our previous papers.4,33–35 We
note here only that the VFF approach is a O(N ) method
and can be eﬃciently parallelized allowing for treatment
of domains containing 108 atoms.35 For InP crystal phase
quantum dots, we neglect strain eﬀects.26,27

Once the atomic positions are given, we use them
to calculate single particle energies with the empiri-
cal nearest-neighbor tight-binding model that accounts
for strain, spin-orbit interactions, crystal lattice symme-
try, and wurtzite crystal ﬁeld splitting in case of zinc-
blende/wurtzite mixed crystal phase quantum dots.34,35
The single-particle tight-binding Hamiltonian for the
system of N atoms and m orbitals per atom can be writ-
ten, in the language of the second quantization, in the
following form:

ˆHT B =

tiα,jβ c+

(12)

where c+
iα (ciα) is the creation (annihilation) operator
of a carrier on the orbital α localized on the site i, Eiα
is the corresponding on-site (diagonal) energy, and tiα,jβ
describes the hopping (oﬀ-site, oﬀ-diagonal) of the par-
ticle between the orbitals on (four) nearest neighboring
sites. Coupling to further neighbors is neglected, whereas
λiα,β (on-site, oﬀ-diagonal) accounts for the spin-orbit
interaction following the description given by Chadi.70

For InAs/GaAs system we use tight-binding parame-
ters set from Ref.47 in sp3d5s⋆ parametrization. More

details of the sp3d5s⋆ tight-binding calculation were dis-
cussed thoroughly in our earlier papers.34,35

For InP crystal phase quantum dots we have used Vogl
et al.49 sp3s⋆ tight-binding parameters augmented to ac-
count for the spin-orbit splitting (126 meV70). We have
additionally modiﬁed these parameters to account for the
increased wurtzite’s band gap (1.474 eV71), the valence
band oﬀset (64.6 meV71) between the wurtzite and zinc
blende segments, and the wurtzite crystal ﬁeld splitting
(26 meV72). The tight-binding parameters used in the
calculation for both phases are summarized in Table I.

For million-atom systems the size of the tight-binding
Hamiltonian34,47 typically exceeds 107, reaching 108 for
the largest crystal phase quantum dot considered in this
work. However, due to the nearest-neighbor approxima-
tion, the Hamiltonian matrix is sparse and the number
of non-zero matrix-elements scales as O(N ). Hamilto-
nian elements are calculated on-demand without occu-
pying computer’s memory. Several lowest electron and
hole states are found by means of Lanczos algorithm with
matrix-vector multiplication parallelized using the MPI
library. We reiterate that thanks to the application of
Lanczos algorithm, and the sparse form of Hamiltonian,
the process of partial Hamiltonian diagonalization scales
linearly with the domain size. More details will be shown
in the following section.

IV. BENCHMARKS

Once single-particle states are calculated, we move
to the eﬃcient calculation of Coulomb matrix ele-
ments. We ﬁrst illustrate our method on the exam-
ple of “standard”34,39 lens-shaped InAs/GaAs quantum
dot. The quantum dot has a diameter of 25 nm and a
height of 3.5 nm and is located on a 0.6 nm thick wetting
layer. The InAs quantum dot and the wetting layer are
embedded into GaAs matrix, with the total number of
atoms in the tight-binding computational domain reach-
ing 0.6 × 106 atoms. This “standard” quantum dot will
be used to benchmark our approach, while later in the
paper we will present results for InP crystal phase quan-
tum dots.

In the tight-binding method the Hamiltonian ma-
trix elements are treated as empirical parameters and
the basis is not explicitly speciﬁed. Due to this free-
dom there are several practical choices possible for
the basis functions.
These typically include Slater
orbitals,29,73 and Hermann-Skillman orbitals.74,75 Slater-
type orbitals are deﬁned by simple rules giving ap-
proximate analytic atomic wave functions,
in form of
φµ = NµYµ (θ, φ) rn−1e−αr, where n is the principal
quantum number, Nµ is the normalization constant, µ
denotes orbital symmetry, and Yµ (θ, φ) corresponding
spherical harmonic, ﬁnally α is a screening constant ob-
tained by a set semi-empirical principles. On the other
hand, Hermann-Skillman orbitals are be obtained by self-
consistent numerical calculations for free atoms and ions.

FIG. 1. Comparison of Slater-type (upper row) orbitals and
Herman-Skillman (lower row) orbitals charge density distribu-
tion for indium and arsenic atomic s valence orbitals. The dis-
tance between indium and arsenic corresponds to InAs bond
length.

Importantly, we note here that there is ongoing research
for new tight-binding schemes76,77 that would remove the
basis ambiguity and directly relate tight-binding param-
eters with a well deﬁned orbital set.
Slater orbitals have analytical

formulation, how-
ever Hermann-Skillman orbitals should correspond more
closely to the actual atomic states. None of these
basis sets is orthogonal (due to non-zero overlaps be-
tween orbitals on neighboring atoms), as assumed by the
Slater-Koster tight-binding approach, however Hermann-
Skillman orbitals are also better localized in space
(Fig. 1) and have smaller overlap between neighboring
sites, whereas Slater orbitals have tails extending over
many lattice sites.

Our implementation accepts any form of orbitals de-
ﬁned as a product of radial and angular parts, whereas
the radial part can be given by an analytical or nu-
merical form. Therefore our method can,
in princi-
ple, utilize orbitals such as those generated by TB-DFT
approach78, or new schemes of empirical tight-binding
parameterization.76,77

mate the single exciton and excitonic complexes binding
energies at the level of Hartree-Fock approximation.35
Figure 2 shows that the cut-oﬀ radius of ≈ 1.5 nm is
suﬃcient for the converged (within 0.1% accuracy) cal-
culation of these Coulomb integrals. We performed nu-
merical tests for numerous quantum dot systems (includ-
ing nanocrystals, self-assembled and nanowire quantum
dots) and generally found that the cut-oﬀ radius of 1.5–
2.0 nm for Herman-Skillman, and 2.0–2.5 nm for Slater
orbitals, is suﬃcient to achieve this level of accuracy. We
also found that the cut-oﬀ radius is, to a large degree,
independent from the size and shape of the investigated
nanosystem.

We note as well that there are ≈ 500 atoms within
1.5 nm cut-oﬀ radius, potentially contributing to a single
grid point. As discussed earlier this is a much smaller
number then total ≈ 106 number of atoms in the compu-
tational domain. Therefore without the Rcut optimiza-
tion (Eq. 7) the reconstruction stage would take 103 times
longer, rendering the entire calculation impractical.

Figure 3 shows the evolution of the same Coulomb in-
tegrals for the same quantum dot system as discussed
earlier (using Herman-Skillman orbitals as well) however
as a function of the grid spatial resolution and assuming
a ﬁxed cut-oﬀ radius equal to 1.5 nm. For large grid steps
there are noticeable oscillations related to the overlap of

the regular computational grid and the underlaying zinc-
blende crystal lattice. These oscillations are particularly
pronounced at the grid spacings 0.2–0.3 nm comparable
to typical InAs and GaAs bond-lengths, however for a
grid step h lower than 0.09 nm integral values stabilize.
Importantly, already for h ≈ 0.1 nm the relative uncer-
tainty due to grid spacing errors is < 1%. We checked
that these conclusions can be generalized to all other in-
tegrals entering the excitonic calculation. Unless spec-
iﬁed otherwise, the results presented below refer to the
h = 0.08 nm = 0.8 ˚A grid step. Further increase of grid
resolution (decrease of h) seem unnecessary as excitonic
properties of quantum dots are determined by contribu-
tions from valence orbitals rather the subatomic details
of atomic cores.

For h ≈ 0.1 nm there is about 100 grid points per
atom, each point storing spin-up and spin-down part of
the wavefunction. For comparison, in the LCAO form
and sp3d5s⋆ parameterization there are 20 spin-orbitals
per atom and therefore 20 (complex) expansion coeﬃ-
cients per single atom. Therefore we note the memory
needed to store the wave-function in the real-space repre-
sentation is increased by factor ≈ 10 (20 for sp3s⋆) when
compared to the conventional TB-LCAO form. For a
million-atom system this corresponds to ≈ 3 GB per sin-
gle TB wavefunction and can be eﬃciently handled by

modern day computers. To summarize, the cut-oﬀ ra-
dius of about 2 nm and grid-step of about 0.1 nm were
found satisfactory for the reasonable convergence of se-
lected Coulomb matrix elements.

Table II shows various Coulomb direct and exchange
integrals calculated for InAs/GaAs lens-shaped quantum
dot (D = 25 nm, h = 3.5 nm) using diﬀerent approaches.
For this particular nanosystem the electron-electron re-
pulsion has larger magnitude than electron-hole attrac-
tion or hole-hole repulsion. In all considered cases there is
only a minor diﬀerence due to dielectric screening model
used in a calculation. This conﬁrms our general conclu-
sion that Coulomb interactions in typical self-assembled
quantum dots are nearly bulk screened as discussed ear-
lier in the text. For the case of Jee all approaches give
similar value of 25–26 meV. There is, however, a substan-
tial discrepancy between diﬀerent approaches for direct
integrals involving hole states, i.e. Jeh and Jhh. This is
particularly noticeable for Jhh ≈ 17.5 meV obtained us-
ing Slater-type orbitals, whereas both Herman-Skillman
orbitals and the simple model of Eq. 6 predict Jhh to
vary between 20.5 and 21.25 meV.

The above diﬀerences can be understood in terms of
atomic orbitals contributions to single particle states.
Whereas, the ground electron and hole states have quite
similar envelopes34, they have much diﬀerent (s- and p-
type correspondingly) dominant orbital contributions. In
particular, p-type (and d-type) Slater-type orbitals are
typically substantially more delocalized in space than
corresponding Herman-Skillman orbitals. Therefore the
diﬀerence between both basis sets is due to spatial extent
of basis orbitals, what will be veriﬁed later in the text.

Apart from Coulomb direct integrals, Table II shows
three selected exchange integrals. Those integrals play
important role in the control of quantum dot excitonic
ﬁne structure.16 The dark-bright exciton exchange split-
ting is determined predominantly by a (real) exchange
matrix element, which also conserves spin: h e↑h⇑e↑h⇑ i,
whereas h e↑h⇓e↓h⇑ i is responsible for mixing of two
bright-excitonic states (e↑h⇓ and e↓h⇑) and therefore
leads to the bright-exciton splitting. Finally h e↑h⇑e↓h⇓ i
mixes two dark states (e↑h⇑ and e↓h⇓) and leads to the
dark-exciton splitting.
In all above cases we used no-
tation where e↑ and e↓ is a Kramers degenerate pair of
states corresponding to the electron ground state energy.
Analogous notation has been used for hole states as well.
For the case of exchange integrals the eﬀect of the basis
has very noticeable consequences. Again, whereas results
obtained using Herman-Skillman orbitals and Eq. 6 agree
reasonably, especially for the electron-hole exchange (≈
0.25 meV), the value calculated by using Slater-type or-
bitals is about three time larger and close to 0.8 meV.
Even larger diﬀerence is reported for integrals related to
the bright-exciton splitting (anisotropic electron-hole ex-
change) and the dark-exciton splitting. In this case the
Slater-type orbitals basis overestimates the other two ap-
proaches by more than an order of magnitude. It should
be noted that the bright-exciton splitting (ﬁne structure

splitting) for cylindrical (or close to cylindrical) quantum
dots observed in the experiment is typically on the order
of 10 to 100 µeV, therefore in clear disagreement with
the approach using Slater-type orbitals.

To study this eﬀect further, Figure 4 shows the same
integrals as presented in Table II, however calculated
as a function of the Coulomb interaction radius which
can be artiﬁcially limited to a certain radius rmax ≡
max |R − R′|.
In this case for a simple model, Eq. 6
is simply replaced with the following formula:

where λ > 0 plays a role of a smoothing parameter. For
clarity we emphasize that the Coulomb interaction cut-
oﬀ radius is a diﬀerent quantity from the wave-function
reconstruction cut-oﬀ radius studied in Fig. 2.

For all considered integrals their values stabilize for
the Coulomb interaction cut-oﬀ radius ≈ 20 nm compa-
rable to the quantum dot diameter. This further proves
that the calculation is free from any eﬀects of the im-
age charges. Fig. 4 (upper row) demonstrates rather
small contributions to the direct matrix elements for
this nanosystem that originate from on-site and nearest-
neighbor contributions, and that these integrals are dom-
inated by the long-range contributions. Interestingly, for
the case of exchange integrals there are noticeable max-
ima in their modulus at about 8–10 nm, corresponding

to approximately one-third of quantum dot diameter (or
three times the quantum dot height). With further in-
crease of the Coulomb interaction cut-oﬀ radius modules
of exchange integrals are reduced and their values sta-
bilize at 20 nm. As this eﬀect is visible for the simple
model (Eq. 6) as wells as for calculations involving ba-
sis, this suggest that there are two long-range, monopole-
monopole contributions to exchange integrals of opposite
character. On the other hand, for the case of exchange
integrals calculated using Slater-type orbitals the short-
range (< 3 nm) contribution is apparently dominant and
is likely responsible for the overestimation of integral val-
ues as compared to other approaches.

As discussed earlier, in case of semiconductor quan-
tum dots, one could assume that for sites which are
far enough apart from each other the exact structure
of the localized orbitals is not important32 and that the
long-range contributions are dominated by the monopole-
monopole interaction of two charge densities localized at
diﬀerent sites. This assumption is clearly not fulﬁlled
for Slater-type orbitals which extend over many lattice
constants from the site center. This is especially impor-
tant for the bright-exciton splitting that has been shown
to be strongly related to the (local) electron-hole non-
orthogonality on the scale of a unit cell.55,56 Slater-type
orbitals localized on neighboring sites, i.e. within the
same unit cell, are clearly (Fig. 1) far from orthogonal,
resulting in strongly overestimated value of anisotropic
exchange integral.

In order to study these eﬀects further, we note that
bulk on-site atomic energies are shifted with respect to
their free atom counterparts.47 By the same token, the
spatial extent of basis orbitals in bulk should be reduced
as compared with free atoms. This claim has been re-
cently supported by work by Benchamekh et al.76 where
microscopic (Bloch) functions for tight-binding model
where obtained by a process in which screening con-
stants α of Slater-type orbitals were optimized by the
ﬁtting. Ref.76 shows that the ﬁtting procedure has rela-
tively small eﬀect on well localized 4s and 4p orbitals (sp3
in tight-binding), e.g. altering 4s screening constant from
1.7 to 1.94. On the other hand, the screening constant

of Slater-type 4d arsenic orbital is increased signiﬁcantly
from 0.27 in free atom case to 0.96 for arsenic site in
GaAs bulk crystal. The screening constant of 5s (i.e. s⋆)
orbital is aﬀected even more, being increased from 0.4 to
over 1.74 for the bulk case. This eﬀectively corresponds
to eﬀective “compression” of atomic orbitals in bulk, and
is especially pronounced for higher orbitals of the largest
spatial extent. These results indicate strong (exponen-
tial) dumping of atomic orbital tails at long distance as
compared to free atoms counterparts, what is apparent
radial density plot as seen on Figure 5. This procedure
reduces signiﬁcantly basis functions tails and the contri-
bution from a given site is on average eﬀectively limited
to the radius of about 1 nm.

Whereas modiﬁed screening constants are currently
not available for indium arsenide, we repeated our calcu-
lations using an approach in which we increased screening
constants on s, p, d, and s⋆ orbitals all atomic species
in the nanosystem by the following values: 0.36, 0.25,
0.7, 1.3. These values are close to modiﬁcations reported
by Ref.76. Results of our calculations are shown on the
right-hand column (Opt. STO) in Table II.

In the optimized case Coulomb and exchange inte-
gral values are similar to those given by a more con-
ﬁned Herman-Skillman basis or the asymptotic model of

Eq. 6 (TB-LCAO). This is particularly pronounced for
exchange integrals, e.g. for |h e↑h⇓e↓h⇑ i| (related to the
bright-exciton splitting) where the “compressed” Slater-
type orbitals give values order of magnitude smaller than
unmodiﬁed orbitals and very close to that of Eq. 6. Oth-
erwise, we note that the choice of unmodiﬁed Slater-type
basis results in severe overestimation of above integrals
due to the overlap of orbitals between far (> 1.0 nm)
neighbors.

V. CRYSTAL PHASE QUANTUM DOTS

Crystal phase quantum dots26,27,72 gained recently a
lot of attraction due to nearly perfect interface between
crystal phases constituting the system, well deﬁned (with
monolayer accuracy) height, and the lack of alloying ef-
fects pestering spectral reproducibility3,79,80 of typical
self-assembled quantum dots.
In this section we apply
our method to a single InP crystal phase quantum dot.
We model this nanostructure by a zinc-blende InP seg-
ment of 1 nm height (3 monolayers, single ABC stacking
sequence) along the [111] direction, embedded between
two 30 nm (100 MLs) long wurtzite InP segments grown
along [0001] direction. Fig. 6 shows corresponding energy
band alignment of the studied system, plotted along the
growth axis, and schematics of the nanosystem. The to-
tal height of the system exceeds 60 nm, whereas we vary
nanowire diameter from 12 to 70 nm, therefore a number
of atoms in the system varies from close 0.3 to over 10
million atoms.

Fig. 7 shows the eﬀective single particle gap (deﬁned as
the energy diﬀerence between ground electron and hole
state) calculated for the crystal phase quantum dot as
a function of a diameter. Importantly, the eﬀective gap
varies substantially from over 1.5 eV for the lowest con-
sidered diameter (11.7 nm) to ≈ 1.46 eV for the largest

considered diameter of 70.4 nm. This results shows that
it is in principle possible to tailor the eﬀective gap of
these nanostructure by control of a nanowire diameter.
On the other hand, Fig. 7 reveals the signiﬁcant role of
lateral conﬁnement, therefore without precise control of
diameter crystal phase quantum dots are subject to a
potential spectral inhomogeneity.

computation scales practically linearly as a function of
number of atoms. The small steps on the plot are re-
lated to parallel computation and load-balancing issues,
i.e. problem of uniform division of a discrete atomic grid
to a discrete number of processors.

As mentioned in the introduction, experimental spec-
tra are obtained for the interacting electron-hole pair, i.e.
exciton. Therefore we follow our single-particle calcu-
lation with a many-body conﬁguration interaction (CI)
calculation. We performed our calculations using two
approaches, ﬁrst is the traditional TB-LCAO method of
Eq. 6 that involved O(N 2) summations, and the second is
our linear-scaling approach. In other to execute this com-
parison we have utilized a limited CI basis involving low-
est three (with spin, six) electron states and lowest four
(with spin, eight) hole states. For each diameter, we have
calculated the total of 1296 electron-electron integrals,
2 × 2304 = 4608 electron-hole Coulomb and exchange
integral, and 4096 hole-hole integrals. Note: Number of in-
tegrals to be calculated is eﬀectively reduced by a factor of four due
to the symmetries of Coulomb matrix elements. Computation
of these integrals is a prerequisite not only for the single
exciton calculations (which involve only electron-hole in-
teractions), but also for other excitonic complexes such
as a biexciton (that additionally needs electron-electron
and hole-hole integrals).
In particular, the above ba-
sis results in total 48 conﬁgurations for the single exci-
ton and 420 conﬁgurations for the biexciton. Such num-
ber of conﬁgurations presents little computational eﬀort
for the CI Hamiltonian diagonalization; however, due to
rapidly (M 4) increasing number of Coulomb matrix ele-
ments, further increase of the CI basis would results in
prohibitive computational times for the method of Eq. 6,
and would render the comparison between methods im-
practical.

FIG. 10. Time of the Coulomb matrix elements calculation
for two diﬀerent approaches (see the text).

Fig. 9 shows the excitonic binding energy for the dis-
cussed crystal phase quantum dot as a function of di-
ameter. The exciton binding energy is deﬁned as a en-
ergy diﬀerence between the ground state of the interact-
ing electron-hole pair and the single particle gap studied
earlier. With the increasing of diameter, the magnitude
(absolute value) of the binding energy decreases from a
high-lateral conﬁnement regime (≈ 14 meV) for small di-
ameters, to nearly bulk-like binding energy of ≈ 6 meV
for the largest diameter. This ﬁgure reveals a transition
from quantum dot-like to a quantum well-like conﬁne-
ment for large diameter systems. The unexpected steps
(e.g. 33 nm) in otherwise monotonous function are an
artefact of a limited (not converged) conﬁguration inter-
action basis set. Most importantly, we note the in the
range where both methods can be compared with each
other (d < 50 nm) they produce practically identical out-
put. We note as well the results shown here were obtained
for the grid step of 1.0 ˚A, yet they diﬀer only by a tiny
fraction of a meV (typically 0.05 meV) from results ob-
tained on the 0.8 ˚A grid. Additionally, we point that due
to C3v symmetry crystal phase quantum dots have ex-
actly vanishing excitonic ﬁne structure6 as conﬁrmed by
our studies, therefore these systems are to a large degree
free from basis dependence artifacts mentioned earlier.

Whereas the excitonic results reported by both meth-
ods are nearly identical, the cost of the computational
diﬀers dramatically as shown on Fig. 10. With the do-
main size growing from 0.28 to 4.5 million atoms, the time
spend in Eq. 5 calculation is increased by more than ≈
460 times, showing strong non-linear scaling. This scal-

ing is even more unfavorable than O(N 2), most likely due
to the increased memory-bandwidth usage (and band-
width bottleneck) for the large number of atoms. On the
other hand, the wave-function reconstruction approach
shows nearly linear scaling, i.e.
the time of computa-
tions is increased by ≈ 30 factor, corresponding to similar
growth of the number of atoms in the domain. The tim-
ings presented on Fig. 10 were obtained for grid spacing
equal to 1 ˚A. We note that for higher resolution grids the
time and memory demand is increased, e.g. by ≈ 40%
factor for the 0.9 ˚Agrid spacing.

In principle, a further speedup could be achieved: both
results were obtained on the same 240-core computer
cluster system, however the FFT part of the calculation
where run on 48 cores only, due to the limited scaling
of the FFT algorithm (as implemented in the FFTW li-
brary, which we have used in this work). Artifacts of
the FFT parallelization are well visible on Fig. 11 where
the total time of the calculation in our approach was di-
vided into the contribution from the reconstruction part
and the FFT step of the computations. The reconstruc-
tion itself scales practically linear as function of number
of atoms and in fact the overall time is dominated by
this stage. Noticeable steps in time dependence of the
FFT part are related to a) additional padding of the re-
construction domain, to ensure good performance of the
FFT, and b) the load balancing issues on parallel com-
puter system. In fact, the FFT time spent in 10-million
case is smaller than in 7-million case, as the grid in the
larger case can be more eﬃciently divided by the number
of processors.

11

We have checked that quasi-linear scaling properties of
our approach are not limited to this particular system,
but instead, it is a general feature, with similar scaling
properties for various nanosystems such as: nanocrystals,
nanowires, self-assembled and nanowire quantum dots.

VI. SUMMARY

We have presented a method for an eﬃcient,
order-N calculation of excitonic spectra of semiconductor
nanosystems. Our method is directly applicable to ten-
million-atom nanostructures, such as crystal phase quan-
tum dots. The ﬁrst steps of strain (only for lattice mis-
matched systems) and the empirical tight-binding calcu-
lation are followed by the eﬃcient calculation of Coulomb
matrix elements and the conﬁguration interaction ap-
proach. Our approach redeﬁnes the tight-binding LCAO
single particles wave-functions on a three-dimensional,
regular grid. The process of wave-function reconstruction
can be performed eﬃciently by relying of a ﬁnite extent of
basis orbitals, with the cut-oﬀ radius smaller than 2.5 nm.
The grid step of about 0.8–1.0 ˚Awas found suﬃcient for
the convergence of the key Coulomb and exchange in-
tegrals aﬀecting excitonic spectra. The grid reproduced
form of the wave-function allows for the application of
Fourier space methods for the calculation of Coulomb
matrix elements that beneﬁt tremendously from the Fast
Fourier Transform algorithm. Our method goes beyond
traditional two-center and monopole-monopole approx-
imations, further our approach can account for diﬀer-
ent models of dielectric screening function and utilize
diﬀerent basis set such as those generated by TB-DFT
approach or new schemes of tight-binding parameteri-
zation. We studied the role of a basis by comparing
results obtained with Slater-type and Herman-Skillman
orbitals and the simpliﬁed O(N 2) approach. We ana-
lyzed the eﬀects of basis locality and orthogonality and
found that long-range tails of basis orbitals aﬀect signif-
icantly values of important electron-hole exchange inte-
grals. The eﬀect of local basis orthogonality is partic-
ularly important for calculations involving bright- and
dark- excitons splitting. The straightforward applica-
tion of highly non-orthogonal Slater-type orbitals would
lead to severe overestimation of bright-exciton splitting
as compared with other approaches. On the other hand
Herman-Skillman orbitals, or recently optimized Slater-
type orbitals, should correspond more closely to the ac-
tual atomic states, however more accurate calculations
of the excitonic ﬁne structure should involve basis sets
directly designed for tight-binding calculations.

Finally, we illustrate our approach with the calcula-
tion for the crystal phase quantum dots with diameter
exceeding 70 nm and number of atoms exceeding 10 mil-
lion. We demonstated pronounced diameter dependence
of both the eﬀective gap and the excitonic binding en-
ergy, with transition to nearly bulk-like binding energy
for the largest diameter system.

12

Linear scaling with number of atoms opens an route
for semi-empirical atomistic calculations of large semi-
conductor systems with number of atoms reaching 108
in near future. Due to its eﬃciency, the method should
allow for new possible application such as self-consistent
calculations for multi-million-atom nanosystems or accu-
rate nanostructure excitonic calculations involving large
many-body basis sets. The range of potential appli-
cations varies from quantum dots of diﬀerent species,
through nanowires, up to modeling of electronic prop-
erties of single dopants embedded in multi-million atoms
transistors.
