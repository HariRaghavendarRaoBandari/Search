We study the masses of open charm and bottom tetraquark states within the diquark-antidiquark scenario
in the relativized quark model proposed by Godfrey and Isgur. The diquark and antidiquark masses are ﬁrstly
solved by relativized quark potential, and then treated as the usual antiquark and quark, respectively. The masses
of tetraquark states are obtained by solving the Schr¨odinger-type equation between diquark and antidiquark. We
ﬁnd the masses of sq¯b ¯q tetraquark conﬁguration are much higher than that of X(5568). This conclusion disfavors
the possibility of X(5568) as a tetraquark state within the diquark-antidiquark scenario. Further experimental
searches are needed to clarify the nature of the signal observed by D0 collaboration.

INTRODUCTION

−1.6 MeV.

−1.9 MeV and 21.9 ± 6.4+5.0

Recently, the D0 collaboration reported the observation of a
narrow structure X(5568) in the X(5568) → B0
sπ± decay pro-
cess based on the pp collision data at √s = 1.96 TeV [1].
Given the ﬁnal states, the X(5568)+ should have four diﬀer-
ent quark ﬂavors su¯b ¯d. The mass and width are 5567.8 ±
2.9+0.9
−2.5 MeV, respectively. Assum-
ing the ﬁnal B0
sπ+ in S wave, the quantum number is I(JP) =
1(0+). Other possibility is that the structure decays through
the chain B0∗s π+, B0
sγ, where the soft photon is not detected.
In the later situation, the quantum number of the new state
would be I(JP) = 1(1+), and the mass is shifted by addition
the mass diﬀerence m(B∗s) − m(Bs) = 48.6+1.8
The discovery has immediately attracted interests and theo-
retical studies on X(5568) with diﬀerent interpretations. Con-
sidering the mass, strong decay, and decay constant, most
works explain the X(5568) as a tetraquark state within the
framework of QCD sum rule and simple quark model [2–13].
This explantation is also suggested by D0 collaboration. Be-
side this prime interpretation, the properties under molecular
picture are studied [14, 15], and some works also investi-
gate the partners of X(5568) [16, 17]. So far, some doubts
exist in the understanding of X(5568). In Ref. [18], the au-
thors suggest that X(5568) may be resulted by the near thresh-
old rescattering eﬀects. Moreover, the quite large production
rate of X(5568) can not be understood by general hadroniza-
tion mechanism [19]. Comprehensive discussions are per-
formed by Burns and Swanson very recently, and ﬁnd that
the threshold, cusp, molecular, and tetraquark models are all
disfavored [20].

Before the observation of X(5568), there have been some
studies on open charm and bottom tetraquark states, which
mainly focus on their masse spectra [21–32]. Those calcula-
tions include diquark-antidiquark picture, compact tetraquark,
mixture of quark-antiquark and four quark components, and
molecular sceneario, which intends to reveal the nature of

D∗s0(2317). Some calculations indicate the D∗s0(2317) can
be treated as tetraquark state [21, 22], while others give
much higher masses of four quark components than that
of D∗s0(2317) as well as the DK threshold [23–27]. For
the molecular scenario, most works indicate that a weekly
bounded DK state can be obtained [28–30], while others sug-
gest the attraction between these two pseudoscalar mesons is
not strong enough to form bound state [31]. In the open bot-
tom sector, higher masses are given in diquark-antidiquark
pictures [27], and it is found the B ¯K system can be weekly
bounded [29, 32].

Unlike the D∗s0(2317), the X(5568) can not be regarded as
a conventional meson or the mixture of quark-antiquark and
four quark components due to its four distinct quark ﬂavors.
The molecular interpretation can not give the right mass and
can be excluded [15, 20, 28, 29, 32]. The tetraquark ex-
planation is supported by QCD sum rule and simple quark
model [3–13], but disfavored by the relativistic calculation
and general discussions [20, 27]. Hence, it is natural to study
the open charm and bottom tetraquark masses within a more
realistic potential model, which is helpful to disentangle this
conﬂict. Furthermore, with experimental progress, more and
more open charm resonances have been observed in recent
years [33–40], which provide good opportunities to search for
open charm tetraquark candidates both theoretically and ex-
perimentally.

In this work, we choose the relativized quark model to cal-
culate the masses of diquark and tetraquark states. The rel-
ativized quark model, proposed by Godfrey and Isgur, have
been extensively used to predict the properties of the con-
ventional mesons [41, 42].
It has been concluded that this
model gives a uniﬁed description of light mesons, heavy-light
mesons and heavy quarkonium, and therefore, it is suitable
to deal with the X(5568) state, in which both light-light and
heavy-light systems are included. Moreover, the relativistic
eﬀects are also considered in the model, which may be es-
sential for the light quarks. We perform a calculation in the
diquark-antidiquark picture following the route proposed by
Ebert, Faustov, and Galkin [27, 43–48]. The corresponding
diquark and antidiquark masses are estimated with the rela-
tivized potential ﬁrstly, an then treated as the usual antiquark
and quark, respectively. The masses of tetraquark states are,

therefore, obtained by solving the Schr¨odinger-type equation
between diquark and antidiquark. We ﬁnd that our results give
much higher masses of sq¯b¯q tetraquark conﬁguration. It dis-
favors the assumption of X(5568) as a tetraquark state. More-
over, the possible candidates of open charm tetraquark states
are also discussed in this work.

This paper is organized as follows. The relativized quark
model is brieﬂy introduced and the masses of diquarks are
calculated in Sec. II. The masses of tetraquark states and dis-
cussions are presented in Sec. III. Finally, we give a short sum-
mary in the last section.

II. MASSES OF DIQUARKS

The Hamiltonian between quark and antiquark in the rela-

tivized quark model can be expressed as

account of the relativistic eﬀects according to the relativized
scheme. The explicit forms of these interactions and the de-
tails of this relativization procedure can be found in Appendix
A of Ref. [41]. For the quark-quark interaction in a diquark,
the relation ˜Vqq(p, r) = ˜Vq ¯q(p, r)/2 is employed since we only
consider the ¯3 type diquark in color. All the model parameters
used in our calculations are taken from Ref. [41].

For the diquark, the qq locates in S wave. The spin-parities
of diquark are JP = 0+ and JP = 1+, named as scalar di-
quark and axial diquark, respectively. We use the Gaussian
expansion method to solve the Hamiltonian (1) with ˜Vqq(p, r)
potential [49]. The masses of these diquarks are listed in Ta-
ble. I.

III. MASSES OF TETRAQUARK STATES

With the diquark listed in Tab. I, we can calculate the
masses of tetraquarks regarded as the bound states of diquark
and antidiquark. While the diquark structure is considered,
the form factor F(r) emerges in the Coulomb-like one-gluon
exchange potential, that is, the −1/r term in quark-antiquark
interaction becomes −F1(r)F2(r)/r in diquark-antidiquark in-
teraction. The F(r), which stands for the internal structure
of diquark, can be approximated with a high accuracy by the
following expression [27]

F(r) = 1 − e−ξr−ζr2

where the ξ and ζ are the nonnegative real numbers. It can
be found that the form factor satisﬁes 0 ≤ F(r) ≤ 1. In our
present work, we calculate the tetraquark mass with F(r) = 1,
and we will discuss the eﬀects induced by this form factor
qualitatively later on.

In the F(r) = 1 case, the screen eﬀects due to ﬁnite size
of the diquark are totally neglected, namely, the diquark is
treated as a point-like antiquark or the distance between di-
quark and antidiquark is large enough [22, 50–56]. The pre-
dicted masses of open charm and bottom tetraquark states in
1S ground states are shown in Tab II. For the sq¯b¯q quark con-
tent, we also plot the mass spectrum in Fig. 1. We ﬁnd that
for a certain quark ﬂavor, the lowest state is the JP = 0+ A ¯A
type diquark-antidiquark conﬁguration. This order of mass
spectrum is diﬀerent with the results of Ref. [27], in which
the JP = 0+ S ¯S type is the lowest one. The spin-spin interac-
tion provides the ﬁne splitting with coeﬃcients of -2, -1, and
2 for the 0+, 1+, and 2+ A ¯A states, respectively, while no ﬁne
structure exists for the S ¯S tetraquark. Although the mass of A
type diquark is higher than that of S type, the larger ﬁne split-
ting induced by the spin-spin interaction can reduce JP = 0+
A ¯A state to be the lowest one. The lowest mass of JP = 0+
sq¯b ¯q state, in our calculation, is 6150 MeV, which is much
larger than the mass of X(5568) state. The lowest mass of
JP = 1+ sq¯b ¯q state is 6210 MeV, which is also larger than
mX(5568) + m(B∗s) − m(Bs). Hence, our calculated results disfa-
vor the possibility of X(5568) as a tetraquark state within the
diquark-antidiquark scenario.

Diﬀerent from our results, some works claim that they can
describe the mass of X(5568) in tetraquark picture. In those
papers, the selected masses of diquarks are lower than ours,
and they are not consistently obtained by solving the quark
model potentials. For example, a set of parameters with
mbq = 5.249 GeV and msq = 0.590 GeV are used to calculate
the masses of sq¯bq tetraquarks, in which the lowest JP = 0+
states is about 150 MeV higher than the X(5568) [4, 22]. If
we take those lighter diquark values as the masses of A type
diquarks and solve the relativized Schr¨odinger-type equation,
we can also obtain a rather low tetraquark mass of 5672 MeV.

states [20]. Another argument is that the tetraquark masses
can be estimated by spin-averaged mass of mesons roughly.
This situation occurs in studying the masses of XYZ states,
where the tetraquark and molecular pictures can both give
similar masses in most cases [57]. The spin-averaged mass
of B∗, B, K∗, and K is 6107 MeV [20], which is well consis-
tent with the 6150 MeV (A ¯A case) in our present calculation.
When the ﬁnite size of diquark is considered, the one-
gluon exchange interaction between diquark and antidiquark
becomes weaker as well as the spin-spin interaction. The
masses of tetraquarks will increase, while the ﬁne splitting be-
comes smaller. This situation is the same as the case adopted
by Ebert, Faustov, and Galkin, where the mass of JP = 0+ S ¯S
type tetraquark is the lowest and the ﬁne splitting is small [27].
In the F(r) = 0 limit, only the linear conﬁning interaction re-
mains, and the three A ¯A type tetraquark states degenerate. Of
course, the X(5568) can not be described as a tetraquark state
even the ﬁnite size and form factor of the diquark are intro-
duced.

Finally, for the open charm resonances observed by LHCb
and BaBar collaboration in recent years [33–40], extensive
theoretical works have been performed in conventional c¯q and
c ¯s pictures within quark pair creation model [58–61], chiral
quark model [62], and heavy quark symmetry [63, 64]. From
the masses, spin-parities, decay modes and lots of theoretical
analyses in the literature, the D∗(2600), D∗1(2760), D∗s1(2760),
and D∗s1(2860) are believed to have the spin-party 1−, the
D(2750)/DJ(2740) has the spin-parity 2−, and D∗3(2760) and
D∗s3(2860) have the spin-parity 3−. Those states have lower
masses and the opposite parities to S wave tetraquark states,
which can be hardly described in tetraquark pictures. The
DJ(3000) and DsJ(3040) are two unnatural states, while the
D∗J(3000) has natural spin-parity. The masses of these three
states are all around 3 GeV. Various theoretical interpretations
of these three resonances are not in agreement with each other.
The properties of DJ(3000), DsJ(3040), and D∗J(3000) and the
possible tetraquark conﬁgurations in Godfrey-Isgur potential,
are shown in Tab. III. We expected that more experimental in-
formation are needed to reveal the natures of these resonances.

However, our present consistent calculations both for diquarks
and tetraquarks in the realistic potential does not support the
X(5568) as a tetraquark state.

Moreover, we know that the masses of bsu ﬂavor baryons
Ξb and Ξ∗b are 5794 and 5945 MeV, respectively. It is natural
to believe that the sq¯b ¯q tetraquarks, containing an additional
valence quark, should be above or at least around these two

IV. SUMMARY

In this work, we study the masses of open charm and bot-
tom tetraquark states in the diquark-antidiquark pictures us-
ing the relativized quark model proposed by Godfrey and Is-
gur. The diquark and antidiquark masses are obtained with

the relativized potential, which is the half of q ¯q interaction.
Then, the diquark and antidiquark are regarded as the usual
antiquark and quark, respectively. The form factor, simulat-
ing the diquark (antiquark) internal structure, is neglected in
our calculations. This assumption means the diquark is treated
as point-like or the distance between diquark and antidiquark
is large enough.

The masses of tetraquark states are obtained by solving the
Schr¨odinger-type equation between diquark and antidiquark.
We ﬁnd the masses of sq¯b ¯q tetraquark conﬁguration are much
higher than that of X(5568), which disfavors the possibility
of X(5568) as a tetraquark state. The eﬀects induced by form
factor and ﬁnite size of diquark are qualitatively discussed,
and the other possible candidates of open charm tetraquark
states are also investigated. We expect that further experimen-
tal information are needed to reveal the nature of the signal
observed by D0 collaboration.

It should be stressed that the very recent discussions based

on chiral symmetry and heavy quark symmetry supports our
conclusion [65]. Moreover, the new results of LHCb collab-
oration observed no peak at X(5568) in pp collision [66].
