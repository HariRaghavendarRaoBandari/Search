A hollow cylindrical micron-scale structure is proposed to enhance and manipulate

the laser plasma interaction. It is shown through 3-D particle-in-cell simulations that

the incident laser pulse intensity is enhanced within the tube. A detailed study of

the intensiﬁcation optimizes the tube dimensions and provides a characterization of

the in-tube intensity. By coupling the micro-tube plasma lens to a traditional ﬂat

interface, we show an increase in on-target intensity. We detail proton energy en-

hancement as a potential application of the micro-tube plasma lens target, where the

tube structure acts to focus the light and provide additional electrons that enhance

the accelerating sheath ﬁeld.

INTRODUCTION

The interaction of intense laser pulses with structured interfaces is of great interest due to

its applications in the generation of high energy electrons, protons, and x-rays. Experimen-

tally, structured target interaction with high intensity laser pulses showed an enhancement

in laser absorption1–3. Recently, snow targets have shown the ability to enhance proton

energies when compared to ﬂat interfaces4. Silicon micro-wire array towers have been used

to demonstrate an enhancement in electron energy and high energy electron yield5. Cone

targets have long been studied for their eﬀects on electron transport6–8.

As technology that can be used for target fabrication has progressed9, advanced struc-

tured interfaces have become an active area of theoretical and simulated research. The

use of cone targets and cone-tube targets has shown an enhancement in energy and di-

rectionality of proton beams10–14. Front surface structures, such as towers and near-critical

density plasmas, have shown an enhancement in proton energy as well15–18. Micro-wire array

targets were suggested to create a highly directed energetic electron beam with enhanced

bremsstrahlung radiation19,20 . The use of hollow cylindrical targets has been demonstrated

to produce bright x-rays and attosecond pulses21,22. Additionally, rear-surface structures

have been demonstrated to collimate secondary electron and ion beams23–25. By making use

of ultrahigh contrast lasers made possible by XPW26 or plasma mirrors27,28, it is possible

for structured interfaces to eﬀectively manipulate the laser-plasma interaction in ways that

remain unexplored and underutilized.

In this article, we present a characterization of the laser pulse inside a micro-tube plasma

(MTP) target. The MTP acts to redistribute the incident pulse intensity within the tube,

resulting in a localized intensiﬁcation of the incident pulse. We explore the eﬀects of varying

the MTP diameter, which allow us to determine the distance from the entrance of the tube to

the intensiﬁed hot spot. We characterize the intensiﬁed in-tube laser pulse through particle-

in-cell (PIC) simulations. Then, by placing a foil at the rear of the optimized MTP lens,

the on-target intensity can be greatly enhanced. Enhanced proton energy is studied as a

potential application of the MTP lens, where we show an increase in maximum attainable

proton energies up to a factor of 3.4 in the optimized case.

II. SIMULATION SETUP

Simulations were performed with the 3D PIC code VLPL29. For ion acceleration simula-
tions, a y-polarized laser pulse propagates along the x-direction in a simulation box of 75λ ×
12λ × 12λ in x × y × z, where λ = 0.8µm is the laser wavelength. During MTP optimization
simulations, the x-dimension of the simulation box was varied to decrease simulation time,

while the y- and z-dimensions remained constant. The cell size was held constant at 0.02
× 0.1 × 0.1 in the x × y × z dimensions for all simulations. A time step of ∆t = 0.008T ,
where T = 2π/ω0 (ω0 is the laser frequency) is chosen to meet the resolution criterion for

relativistic electron motion30. A transversely super-gaussian laser pulse with pulse proﬁle
ay = a0e−(r/σ)4−(t/τ )2 is focussed to a position of 29λ onto a CH2 substrate foil with thick-
ness 5λ. The foil thickness is chosen such that for all geometries studied, the dominant ion

acceleration mechanism is expected to be target normal sheath acceleration (TNSA). The

laser amplitude is initially a0 = 50 where a = eEl/meω0c , duration τ = 12T , and focal spot

σ = 3λ, which are chosen to closely match the parameters of the Scarlet laser housed at

Ohio State University31,32. On the front surface of the foil, we position carbon microtubes of

varying length (L) and inner diameter (ID) with a wall thickness of λ, as shown in Figure 1a.

The length of a given microtube ID was chosen based on optimization of the intensiﬁcation

factor as discussed below. The electron density of the tube is chosen to be ne = 180nc
(nc = me0ω2/e2 is the critical plasma density) to imitate the electron density of tubes that

are easily manufactured using 3-D printing techniques. The rear CH2 foil is initialized to

ne = 150nc. The whole target is initially cold and fully ionized.

III. SIMULATION RESULTS

The full detail of light intensiﬁcation within a MTP lens can be found elsewhere33. In

short, a laser pulse incident on a hollow cylindrical aperture will undergo diﬀraction. In

the near-ﬁeld Fresnel region, the result is a boost of the intensity within the cylinder re-

sulting from a redistribution of the incident pulse. Previous work showed by varying the

pulse intensity while maintaining the tube geometry that there is an intensity dependent

intensiﬁcation factor, where as the incident pulse becomes more intense the intensiﬁcation

factor increases. The intensity dependence results from additional diﬀraction caused by tube

tube electron density (purple), proton density (green), and laser intensity (red) at t=10T (a), 30T

(b), and 50T (c), respectively. The laser enters from the left of the simulation and is incident on

a micro-tube plasma (MTP) lens coupled to a 5λ thick CH2 foil. The length (L) and the inner

diameter (ID) of the MTP lens are varied to locate the intensity spike on the rear substrate and

optimize the on-target intensity.

electrons being dragged into the hollow region of the MTP. In order to optimize the inten-

siﬁcation eﬀect, we perform simulations on MTP targets with variable dimensions. Since

diﬀraction is dependent on the geometrical properties of the hollow cylinder, we ﬁx the in-

4

cident pulse parameters while varying the tube dimensions to characterize the in-tube laser

proﬁle. Then, using the MTP structure as a focusing element, we place an optimized MTP

on the front surface of a ﬂat CH2 foil and investigate the MTP eﬀects on proton acceleration.

A. Tube Length Optimization and Characterization

By varying the ID of the MTP target, the location and level of intensiﬁcation varies

greatly. As such, we conducted an extended study on the optimal relation between tube

ID and length. The tube ID was studied without the rear CH2 in order to determine the

ﬁeld as seen at the location of peak intensity, the results of which are summarized in Table

I. The ID was varied from 2-7λ using a laser pulse as described above. The intensiﬁcation

factor, deﬁned as ηpeak = Ipeak, in tube/Ipeak, input, is noted for each tube diameter studied.

With a smaller tube, the diﬀraction eﬀect coupled with the background plasma focussing

eﬀect causes the peak intensity to be closer to the entrance of the tube. As the ID is

increased, the focussing position is shifted farther from the entrance of the tube. A peak

intensity snapshot is shown in Figure 2 (a)-(c). As shown, the highest peak intensity from

the geometries studied is found with the 2λ ID tube (ηpeak = 8.56), although simulation

results suggest this intensiﬁcation is short lived, as detailed later in the text. The 4λ ID

tube also demonstrates an exemplary peak intensiﬁcation (ηpeak = 8.36), with the peak

intensity falling lower for the larger ID tubes.

In order to fully characterize the in-tube

pulse proﬁle, we examine the lifetime of the focussing eﬀect to determine the inﬂuence of

increase background plasma that is found at smaller tube ID.

In order to characterize the focal spot lifetime, we locate the position and time of peak

intensity within the micro-tube. We record the intensity in the entire simulation every half

laser period. At the time of the peak intensiﬁcation, we average the intensity longitudinally
in space over x = ±λ/4 from the location of peak intensity, as shown in Figure 2 (a)-(c),
where the green box indicates the location where the averaging takes place. This is repeated
for ±12 laser periods from the peak time in order to capture the majority of the beam.
After this averaging, we note the peak value of the averaged intensity, Iave, in tube. We deﬁne

the intensiﬁcation of the beam averaged in this way as ηave = Iave, in tube/Iave, input, where

Iave, input is the peak value of the input pulse average in the same manner as Iave, in tube. The

results from this averaging technique is shown in Figure 2 (d)-(f), while line-outs of these

intensity distributions are shown in (g)-(i). We ﬁnd that ηave is best for ID = 4λ with a

value of 5.0, while the average intensiﬁcation falls oﬀ on either side of this peak. The 4λ ID

matches the peak intensity with hot-spot duration well, resulting in an ηpeak greater then 8

and an ηave up to 5.

B. Proton Acceleration Enhancement

With a well characterized interaction between the incident pulse and variable MTP lenses,

a series of simulations coupling a CH2 foil to the location of the peak intensity have been

performed. The proton energy spectrum for four representative cases is shown in Figure 3

pulse, while cases 1-6 show the eﬀects of varying the ID of a micro-tube plasma lens. The length

column represents the distance from the entrance of the MTP lens where the peak intensity occurs.

The peak intensiﬁcation is deﬁned as ηpeak = Ipeak, in tube/Ipeak, input. The average intensiﬁcation,

ηave = Iave, in tube/Iave, input, is calculated by an averaging technique described in the body of the
paper. The spot size is listed as the FWHM in y × z for the pulse averaged in space over a half

to determine the eﬀects of light intensiﬁcation without the MTP plasma eﬀects included.

at t = 90T , where the incident pulse is focussed on the front of the CH2 foil at t = 30T .

For reasons shown below, although the optimized 4λ gives the best on-target intensity, this

does not necessarily equate to the best ion energy spectrum with the rear foil parameters

studied in this work.

Instead, the highest energy protons found in our study arise from

the 6λ ID MTP. This result indicates that the enhancement of TNSA does not solely arise

from the intensiﬁed on-target laser ﬁeld, but is more likely a combination of several eﬀects.

As is known, TNSA is more relied on hot electrons but less sensitive to the laser intensity

I). It is thus natural to assume that introducing the tube also enhances the generation

(∼ √

of energetic electrons.

We identify two main components that are responsible for the enhanced ion energy: a

higher on-target intensity and an enhanced sheath ﬁeld. In an eﬀort to elucidate the eﬀects

from the contributing factors, an additional simulation with an altered incident pulse onto

a ﬂat CH2 was performed. In order to determine the eﬀects of the high on-target intensity

(case 5, blue) at T=90. The most energetic ions are found using the optimized parameters for a

6λ ID MTP target.

independently of the plasma eﬀects of the tube, we used the beam conditions as characterized

at the peak location in the tube to irradiate a ﬂat foil.

1.

Increased On-Target Intensity

In the TNSA model, the maximum ion energy scales as Eion,max α I 1/234. If the enhance-

ment in maximum ion energy were due only to the intensiﬁcation within the tube, the highest

proton energy would arise from the 4λ ID tube. This is not the case, as the 6λ ID tube

produces a maximum proton energy of 232 MeV, whereas the 4λ ID MTP target achieves

a peak proton energy of 166.5 MeV. In an eﬀort to understand the eﬀect of intensiﬁcation

on the proton energy distribution, we perform a simulation using a laser pulse with a0 = 87

interacting with a ﬂat CH2. As shown in Table I, the pulse matches reasonably well with

the characterized pulse for our initial investigations with the 6λ ID MTP lens. The proton

energy spectrum from this simulation is shown in green in Figure 3. The maximum proton

energy from the a0 = 87 simulation reaches 78 MeV, which is slightly higher than that of

the a0 = 50 simulation (black, 66 MeV), but not nearly as high as the maximum energy

achieved with optimized MTP targets. Clearly, the dominant eﬀect of proton enhancement

8

cannot be attributed solely to the intensiﬁcation in this target regime.

2. Enhanced Sheath Field

The substrate thickness dictates that the majority of high energy protons originate from

the rear of the CH2 foil. As such, the dominant factor in the proton acceleration is the

sheath ﬁeld. In order to understand the sheath ﬁeld eﬀect, we look at the electric ﬁelds

that arise at the rear of the foil in the 6λ ID MTP target and compare this to the ﬂat

CH2 foil. Figure 4 shows the longitudinal electric ﬁelds for the two cases at t = 30T and

t = 50T . The 6λ ID MTP target has a sheath ﬁeld that not only has a higher peak value

(>100 MV/µm) as evident by Figure 4 (a)-(b), but also has an extended longitudinal range

as seen in the (c)-(d) of the same ﬁgure. Additionally, we compare the maximum sheath

FIG. 4. Electron density (grayscale) and the longitudinal electric ﬁeld Ex (color scale) in the x-y

plane at z=0 for a (a),(c) ﬂat foil and (b),(d) 6λ ID MTP lens target (Case 5) at the time the peak

of the laser pulse reaches the front of the CH2 foil (a)-(b) and 20T later in the simulation (c)-(d).

Note the log scale of electron density in (a)-(b) to show the periodic electron bunches located in

the tube, while the linear scale of electron density in (c)-(d) highlight the increased front-surface

target deformation when using the MTP lens target. The proton distribution on a log scale 20T

after the peak reaches the front of the CH2 foil is shown in (e)-(f).

ﬁeld value for the two cases every two laser periods through the interaction of the laser pulse

(Figure 5). The sheath ﬁeld in the 6λ ID case develops at an earlier time than the ﬂat CH2,

9

and reaches a peak value that is nearly double that of the ﬂat foil. It is worth noting that

while the increased on-target intensity is not the primary contributing factor to enhanced

TNSA, the strong deformation of the substrate interface in the MTP case in Figure 4 (d)

indicates an increased hole-boring velocity compared to the ﬂat interface in (c). This is a

direct consequence of the enhanced on-target intensity with the MTP lens target.

FIG. 5. Maximum sheath ﬁeld (solid line) and proton energy (dashed line) evolution for the ﬂat

CH2 foil (Case 0, blue) and the optimized 6λ MTP lens target(Case 5, red) where 0T corresponds

to the peak of the incident pulse reaching the front surface of the CH2 foil.

The sheath ﬁeld enhancement is attributed to high density electron bunches that are

pulled out of the tube from the transverse laser electric ﬁeld and accelerated forward via

direct laser acceleration (DLA) of the laser pulse12. When the laser pulse is suﬃciently

intense, these electrons can stay in the acceleration phase for a longer time. As the laser

reaches the critical surface of the rear foil, the electrons decouple from the laser, and move

through the rear foil, as seen in Figure 1b. These electrons are clearly visible in Figure 4b,

and act to periodically enhance the sheath ﬁeld as shown in the colorscale of the Figure 4b.

The high density, highly localized electrons result in an electric sheath ﬁeld that is far greater

than one would expect from bulk hot electrons typically associated with TNSA of ions as

described by the ponderomotive scaling35. Additionally, the sheath ﬁeld peak value at later

times (Figure 4(c)-(d)) is similar in the two cases; however, the longitudinal extent of the

sheath ﬁeld is greatly enhanced in the case of the MTP lens target. The simulation results

demonstrate that the conﬁnement of localized electron bunches that result from the MTP

lens structured interface give rise to enhanced sheath ﬁelds and ultimately, much higher

10

proton energies.

IV. CONCLUSION

In conclusion, we investigated the interaction of a highly relativistic laser pulse with

micro-tube plasma lens coupled to traditional ﬂat interfaces. By varying the dimensions of

the MTP lens, we characterize the in-tube laser pulse to optimize the on-target intensity.

Finally, we establish a potential application of the MTP lens target by demonstrating an

enhancement in proton energy when comparing to traditional ﬂat interfaces. The enhanced

ion acceleration is a results from laser pulse intensiﬁcation as well as localized electron

bunches that are guided by the MTP walls. Other intensity favorable mechanisms such as

radiation pressure acceleration (RPA)36,37, break-out afterburner acceleration (BOA)38, and

X-ray generation39 would likely beneﬁt more so than TNSA from the MTP target, and these

studies are currently underway. Our results show that with current laser and 3D printing

technology, it is possible to increase the on-target intensity and eﬃciently acceleration ions

to signiﬁcantly higher energies.
