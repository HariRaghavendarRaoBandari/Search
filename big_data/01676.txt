EXPLOSIVE SOLUTIONS OF PARABOLIC STOCHASTIC

PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS WITH L´eVY NOISE

KEXUE LI, JIGEN PENG, JUNXIONG JIA

Abstract. In this paper, we study the explosive solutions to a class of parbolic
stochastic semilinear diﬀerential equations driven by a L´evy type noise. The suf-
ﬁcient conditions are presented to guarantee the existence of a unique positive
solution of the stochastic partial diﬀerential equation under investigation. More-
over, we show that positive solutions will blow up in ﬁnite time in mean Lp-norm
sense, provided that the initial data, the nonlinear term and the multiplicative
noise satisﬁes some conditions. Several examples are presented to illustrated the
theory. Finally, we establish a global existence theorem based on a Lyapunov
functional and prove that a stochastic Allen-Cahn equation driven by L´evy noise
has a global solution.

1. Introduction

Fujita [21] considered the initial-boundary problem for a semilinear parabolic

equation

= ∆u + u1+α, t > 0, x ∈ Rd,

∂u
∂t
u(x, 0) = a(x), x ∈ Rd,

(1.1)



Fujita showed that there does not exist a global solution for any nontrivial nonneg-

ative initial data when 0 < dα < 2, and there exists a global solution for suﬃciently

small initial data when dα > 2. Hayakawa [23] proved that (1.1) has no global

solution for any nontrivial nonnegative initial data in the critical case dα = 2 if the

dimension d equals 1 or 2.

Fujita [22] studied the initial-boundary problem for a semilinear parabolic equation

Denote λ0 as the smallest eigenvalue of −∆ and the corresponding eigenfunction

Assume that f satisﬁes the following

(f.1) f is locally Lipschitz continuous.

(f.2) f (0) ≥ 0 and f (r) > 0 for r > 0.

(f.3) 1/f is integrable at t = +∞.

(f.4) f is convex in [0, ∞).

(f.5) f (r) − λ0r > 0 for r >RD a0φ0dx, where a0 = exp(−k|x|2), k > 0, x ∈ Rd.

Fujita [22] showed that if D is bounded, a(x) ≥ 0 in D and f satisﬁes (f.1)- (f.5),

then the solution of (1.2) blows up in ﬁnite time. As a special case that f (r) =

r1+α(α > 0), the solution of (1.2) blows up in ﬁnite time if

We refer to [20] about the many developments on solutions of nonlinear parabolic

equations may blow up in ﬁnite time.

Recent years, stochastic partial diﬀerential equations has attracted the atten-

tion of many researchers.

It is of interest to study the non-existence of global

solutions to parabolic stochastic partial diﬀerential equations perturbed by random

noise as follows:



du = ∆u + f (u) + σ(u)dWt, t > 0, x ∈ D,

u(x, 0) = g(x), x ∈ D,

u(x, t) = 0, x ∈ ∂D.

(1.3)

When f (u) ≡ 0, σ(u) = uγ (γ ≥ 1), Mueller [24] considered the equation

∂u
∂t

= ∆u + uγ ˙W , γ ≥ 1, t > 0, 0 ≤ x ≤ J,

u(t, 0) = u(t, J) = 0,



(1.4)

where ˙W = ˙W (t, x) is 2-parameter white noise and u(x, 0) is nonnegative and con-

tinuous. The conclusion is that for 1 ≤ γ < 3

2, u exists for all time. Mueller [25]
showed that when u(x, 0) is a continuous nonnegative function on [0, J], vanishing

at the endpoints, but not identically zero, then there is a positive probability that

the solution u of (1.4) blows up in ﬁnite time if γ > 3/2. When σ(u) ≡ 1 and the

Laplacian operator ∆ is replaced by the inﬁnitesimal generator of a C0 semigroup,

Prato and Zabczyk [14] considered the stochastic semilinear equation

( du = (Au + F (u))dt + dW

u(0) = ξ,

(1.5)

where A is the generator of semmigroup S(t) = eAt on a Banach space E, and F is

a mapping from E into E. W is a Wiener process deﬁned on a probability space

(Ω, Ft, P ). ξ is an F0-measurable E-valued random variable. They assumed that F

satisﬁes the Lipschitz condition on bounded sets of E. This property of F together

with some other conditions ensure that (1.5) has a unique non-exploding solution.

When σ(u) = σ (positive constant), W is a 2-dimensional Brownian sheet, f is

a nonnegative, convex function such thatR ∞

proved that the solution to (1.3) blows up in ﬁnite time with probability one for every

0 1/f < ∞, Bonder and Groisman [26]

nonnegative initial datum u(x, 0) ≥ 0. Dozzi and L´opez-Mimbela [27] considered

the equation (1.3) with σ(u) = κu, where β, κ are given positive numbers, Wt is a

standard one-dimensional Brownian motion. They proved that the solution of (1.3)

blows up in ﬁnite time with positive probability if f (u) ≥ Cu1+β (u > 0, C > 0 ).

a continuous Wiener random ﬁeld deﬁned in a complete probability space (Ω, F , P )

with a ﬁltration Ft. W (x, t) has mean EW (x, t) = 0 and covariance function q(x, y)

deﬁned by

E{W (x, t)W (y, t)} = (t ∧ s)q(x, y), x, y ∈ Rd,

where t ∧ s = min{t, s} for 0 ≤ t, s ≤ T . Let H = L2(D), H 1 = H 1(D) be

the L2-Sobolev space of ﬁrst order and H 1

0 the closure in H 1 of the space of C 1-

functions with compact support in D. Under the usual conditions, such as coercivity

conditions, Lipschitz continuity and boundedness conditions, Eq.(1.6) has a a unique

global strong solution u ∈ C([0, T ]; H) ∩ L2([0, T ]; H 1) (see [4, Theorem 3-7.2]).

To consider positive (nonnegative) solutions, the author assume that the following

conditions hold:

(P1) There exists a constant δ ≥ 0 such that

(P2) The function f (r, x, t) is continuous on R × D × [0, T ] such that f (r, x, t) ≥ 0

for r ≤ 0 and x ∈ D, t ∈ [0, T ].

(P3) The initial datum g(x) on D is positive and continuous.

Chow [12] proved that the solution of Eq.(1.6) is positive. Under some suitable

conditions, Chow [12, 2] showed that the positive solutions of a class of stochastic

reaction-diﬀusion equations will blow up in the Lp-norm sense, p ≥ 1. Chow and Liu

5

[3] considered the problem of explosive solutions in mean Lp-norm sense of semilinear

stochastic functional parabolic diﬀerential equations of retarded type.

Lv and Duan [1] considered the Eq.(1.6) with A = △, the Laplacian operator,

the nonlinear term f is assumed to be satisﬁed by an inequality, which is weaker

than the condition (P2), the noise intensity σ allows to be higher nonlinear than the

square nonlinear (see [1, formula (3.2)]). They proved that the noise could induce

ﬁnite time blow up of solutions.

Recent years, stochastic partial diﬀerential equations driven by L´evy noise have

attracted many attentions (see, for example, [15, 5, 9, 17, 14, 18, 8, 6, 10]). But

there are few results about the existence of explosive solutions to stochastic partial

diﬀerential equations with L´evy noise in the literature. Bao and yuan [7] considered

the stochastic reaction-diﬀusion equations with jumps

that the solution of (1.7) blows up in ﬁnite time. It should be pointed out that the

nonlinear term b : [0, ∞) × R × O 7→ R is assumed to be locally Lip-continuous w.r.t

the second variable such that b(t, r, x) ≥ 0 for any r ≤ 0, however, there are many

functions don’t satisfy this condition, for example, b(r) = r(1 − r2). And O ⊂ Rn is

assumed to be bounded, the proof of Theorem 2.1 in [7] depends on the boundedness

of volume of O. The results of [7] can’t be generalized to the case for unbounded

domain, such as O = Rn.

In this paper, we study the problem of explosive solutions to a class of semi-

linear stochastic parabolic diﬀerential equations driven by L´evy noise. The paper

is organized as follows.

In Section 2, we recall some basic results for semilinear

stochastic parabolic equations with L´evy noise. In Section 3, under some assump-

tions, we prove that the existence of positive solutions of a semilinear stochastic

reaction-diﬀusion equation.

In Section 4, under some suitable conditions on the

drift or diﬀusion term, we prove that the solutions of stochastic parabolic diﬀeren-

tial equations will blow up in a ﬁnite time in mean Lp-norm sense, p ≥ 1. Some

examples are presented to illustrate the theory. In Section 5, we establish a global

existence theorem based on a Lyapunov functional. We show that the existence of

global solution to stochastic Allen-Cahn equation driven by L´evy noise.

2. Preliminaries

Let D be a domain in Rd, which has a smooth boundary if it is bounded.

Denote L2(D) by H, the usual L2 real Hilbert space with the inner product (·, ·)

and norm k · k, respectively. Let H 1 = H 1(D) be the L2-Sobolev space of ﬁrst order.

Denote H 1

0 the closure in H 1 of the space of C 1-functions with compact support

in D. Denote by D([0, T ], H) the space of all c`adl`ag paths from [0, T ] into H. Let

W (x, t) be a continuous Wiener random ﬁeld deﬁned on a complete probability space

(Ω, F , P) with a ﬁltration Ft. W (x, t) has mean zero and covariance function q(x, y)

such that

EW (x, t) = 0, E{W (x, t)W (y, t)} = (t ∧ s)q(x, y), s, t ∈ [0, T ], x, y ∈ Rd.

The associated covariance operator Q in H with kernel q(x, y) is deﬁned by

(Qφ)(x) =ZD

q(x, y)φ(y)dy, x ∈ D, φ ∈ H.

7

In this paper, we assume that the covariance function q(x, y) is bounded, continuous

and there is q0 > 0 such that

sup
x,y∈D

|q(x, y)| ≤ q0 and Tr Q =ZD

q(x, x)dx < ∞.

Let (Z, B(Z) be a measurable space. Denote by N(dt, dz) the Poisson random

measure with intensity measure dtν(dz) on R+ × Z, here R+ = [0, ∞), dt is the

Lebesgue measure on R+, ν(dz) is a σ-ﬁnite measure on (Z, B(Z)). Denote by

eN (dt, dz) = N(dt, dz) − dtν(dz) the compensated Poisson measure. Assume that W

and N are independent.

equation in domain D ⊂ Rd:

Let ut = u(·, t), Ft(u) = f (u, ·, t), Σt(u) = σ(u, ∇u, ·, t), Γt(u, z) = ϕ(u, ·, z, t)



satisfy the Lipschitz continuity and boundedness conditions, the equation (2.2) has

a unique global strong solution u ∈ L2([0, T ]; H −1) ∩ D([0, T ]; H)( see Theorem 3.2,

[6]).

To consider the positive solutions, we assume that (2.1) has a unique (strong)

8

solution. In addition, we assume that

(A1)

f (u, x, t) ≥ a1uβ + a2u,

where a1, a2 ∈ R, β > 1, (−1)β ∈ R and

> 0, if (−1)β = 1,

< 0, if (−1)β = −1.

ϕ2(u, x, z, s) ≤ ψ(z)|u(x, s)|µ.

(2.4)

(A4) the initial datum g(x) on D is positive and continuous.

As in [12], let η(r) = r− denote the negative part of r for r ∈ R, or η(r) = 0,

if r ≥ 0 and η(r) = −r if r < 0. Set k(r) = η2(r) so that k(r) = 0 for r ≥ 0 and

k(r) = r2 for r < 0. For ε > 0, let kε(r) be a C 2-regularization of k(r) deﬁned by

Lemma 2.1. (see [12]). The ﬁrst two derivatives k′

ε, k′′

ε of kε are continuous and

satisfy the conditions: k′

ε(r) = 0 for r ≥ 0; and k′′

ε (r) ≥ 0 for any r ∈ R. Moreover,

as ε → 0, we have

kε(r) → k(r), k′

ε(r) → −2η(r) and k′′

ε (r) → 2θ(r),

(2.6)

where θ(r) = 0 for r ≥ 0, θ(r) = 1 for r < 0, and the convergence is uniform for

r ∈ R.

3. Positive solutions

In this section, we will consider the existence of positive solution of Eq. (2.1).

Theorem 3.1 Suppose that the conditionss (A1)-(A4) hold. Then the solution of

initial-boundary value problem (2.1) with nonnegative and continuous data remains

positive so that u(x, t) ≥ 0, a.s. for almost every x ∈ D and for all t ∈ [0, T ].

Remark 3.1. The assumption (A1) is weaker than the assumption (H1) in [7]. For

example, if we consider the Allen-Cahn type equation, f (u) = u − u3 doesn’t satisfy

(H1), but f satisﬁes (A1).

Remark 3.3. If it is assumed that β ∈ (0, 1), for the case 1 + β ≤ m < 2 and

1 + β ≤ q < 2, by the Lp interpolation inequality and Young inequality, we can get

the corresponding results.

4. Explosive solutions

13

In this section, we consider the unbounded solutions of the equation (2.1).

For the elliptic equation:

( Aϑ = −λϑ, in D,

ϑ = 0, on ∂D,

(4.1)

it is well known that all the eigenvalues of −A are strictly positive, increasing and

the eigenfunction φ corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue λ1 does not change sign

in the domain D (see p. 355, [16]). We can normalize it in such a way that

φ(x) ≥ 0,

ZD

φ(x)dx = 1.

(4.2)

Theorem 4.1. Suppose the initial-boundary value problem (2.1) has a unique local

solution and the conditions (A1)-(A4) hold. In addition, we assume that λ1 > a2,

a1 > 0, and

and if λ1 < a2, we assume thatRD g(x)φ(x)dx > 0, where λ1 is the smallest eigen-

value of −A and φ is the corresponding eigenfunction. Then, for any p ≥ 1, there

exists a constant Tp > 0 such that

Proof. By Theorem 3.1, Eq. (2.1) has a unique positive solution. We will prove

the theorem by contradiction. We suppose (4.3) is false. Then there exists a global

positive solution u such that

for any T > 0. Let φ be the the eigenfunction deﬁned in (4.1). Deﬁne

ξ in D, independent of Wt. The equality (4.4) can be interpreted as an expectation

for Eq. (4.11).

Since T is arbitrary, this results in a contradiction. Therefore, the mean square

inequality, we see that (4.14) holds for each p ≥ 2. (cid:3)

Remark 4.1. In [2], [3], the correlation function q(x, y) is assumed to satisfy the

inequality

ZDZD

q(x, y)v(x)v(y)dxdy ≥ q1ZD

v2(x)dx

(4.21)

for any positive v ∈ H and for some q1 > 0.

In fact, this assumption is not suitable.

If the domain D is bounded and

20

q ∈ (0, 1], by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have

ZDZD

q(x, y)v(x)v(y)dxdy ≤(cid:0)ZD

v(x)dx(cid:1)2

≤ µ(D)ZD

v2(x)dx,

where µ(D) is the volume of D. By (4.21), (4.22), we have µ(D) ≥ q1.

(4.22)

If the

bounded domain D is small enough, then we get a contradiction.

Remark 4.2. We consider the problem (4.13) with a Levy-type noise, and the

coeﬃcient operator A is more general than the Laplacian, it is easy to see that

Theorem 4.2 is the generalization of Theorem 4.3 in [1].

Example 4.2. Consider the following problem in a spherical domain D = B(R) in

sponding to the Poisson random measure N(dt, dz), W (x, t) is a continuous Wiener

random ﬁeld with the covariance function

q(x, y) = b0 exp{−ρ(x · y)}, x, y ∈ R3.

i=1 xiyi. Here A = △,

For x, y ∈ B(R), we have

q(x, y) ≥ κ = b0 exp{−ρR2}.

Then for any non-negative v ∈ H,

ZDZD

q(x, y)v(x)v(y)dxdy ≥ κ(cid:0)ZD

v(x)dx(cid:1)2.

The condition (A1′) holds. It is obvious that f = u1+α > 0 for u > 0, the condition

(A2′) holds. Let G(u) = µ2u4, σ0(u) = µu4. Then σ(u, x, t) = µu4 = σ0(u)

and σ2

0(u) = G(u2). σ0 and G are both continuous, positive and convex. The

condition (A3′) is satisﬁed. Let ϕ0(u, z) = c0zu6. Assume R ∞
K(u) = (cid:0)c0R ∞

0 z2ν(dz)(cid:1)u6. Then ϕ(u, x, z, t) = c0zu6 = ϕ0(u, z). ϕ0 and K are

both positive and convex. The condition (A4′) holds. The smallest eigenvalue of

0 z2ν(dz) < ∞, let

21

the elliptic equation (4.1) is λ1 = ( π

b0 exp{−ρR2}µ2u4 +(cid:0)c0R ∞

0 z2ν(dz)(cid:1)u6 − 2( π

The condition (A5′) is satisﬁed. If a0 is suﬃciently large, simliar to (4.12),we have

RD g(x)φ(x)dx > M. By Theorem (4.2), the solution of (4.23) will blow up in ﬁnite

time in Lp-norm for any p ≥ 2.

Now we consider the explosive solution problem for (2.1), when the domain D

is unbounded, for example, D = Rd. Let B(R) = {x ∈ Rd : |x| < R}.

Theorem 4.3. Assume that the initial-boundary value problem (2.1) has a unique

local solution and the conditions (A1)-(A3) hold, where D = Rd. Then for any

R > 0, there exists a constant Tp(R) > 0 such that

lim

t→Tp(R)−

E(cid:8)ZB(R)

|u(t, x)|p(cid:9)1/p

= ∞,

provided that the conditions of Theorem 4.1 holds for p ≥ 1 or the conditions of

Theorem 4.2 holds for p ≥ 2, where D = Rd.

Proof. The proof follows the spirit of the one for Theorem 3.3 in [3]. For the sake

of completeness, we present it. We only consider the case under the conditions of

Theorem 4.1, since the proof under the conditions of Theorem 4.2 is similar.

By restricting the solution u to B(R), let ˆu(t) = RB(R) u(x, t)φ(x)dx ≥ 0 as

deﬁned by (4.4). Since u ≥ 0 on the boundary ∂B(R), by Green’s identity,

(Aut, φ) = −λ1φ +Z∂B(R)

u(x, t)(cid:0) −

∂φ(x)

∂ν (cid:1)dS.

(4.24)

Denote n = (n1, n2, . . . , nd) as the unit outward normal vector to the boundary

∂B(R). Since there exists a constant c > 0 such that Pd
all x ∈ D and ξ = (ξ1, . . . , ξd) ∈ Rd. We have ν · n =Pd

i,j=1 aij(x)ξiξj ≥ c|ξ|2 for

i,j aijninj ≥ 0. This implies

that the conormal ν(x) is an exterior direction ﬁeld. Since φ > 0 in B(R) and φ = 0

on ∂B(R), we have

22

∂φ(x)

∂ν

≤ 0.

(4.25)

Putting (4.24) into (4.5), by (4.25), we obtain the inequality (4.7). The rest of proof

can be completed as in Theorem 4.1. (cid:3)

Remark 4.3. In [7], when the domain D = Rd, it seems impossible to consider

the existence of the position solution of initial-boundary value problem (2.1) and

the explosionn of the position solution. The reason is that the proof of Theorem

2.1 in [7] relies on the fact that the volume V (D) of domain D is bounded. In [7],

the proofs of Theorem 3.1 and Theorem 4.1 are both rely on Theorem 2.1. So for

D = Rd, they are not valid.

(1) Φ : UT → R is locally bounded and continuous such that its ﬁrst two partial

derivatives ∂tΦ(v, t), Φ′(v, t) and Φ′′(v, t) exist for each (v, t) ∈ UT .

(2) The derivatives ∂tΦ and Φ′ ∈ V are locally bounded and continuous in UT .

(3) For any Γ ∈ L1(V ), the map: (v, t) → T r[Φ′′(v, t)Γ] is locally bounded and

continuous in (v, t) ∈ UT .

(4) Φ′(·, t) : U → V is such that (Φ′(·, t), v) is continuous in t ∈ [0, T ] for any v ∈ V

and

for some κ > 0.

kΦ′(v, t)k ≤ κ(1 + kvk), (v, t) ∈ U × [0, T ],

Let U ⊂ V be a neighborhood of the origin. By a similar statement to that in

[4, pp. 228], we present the deﬁnition of Lyapunov functional. Deﬁne the operator

Lt as follows:

LtΦ(v, t) =

Φ(v, t) +

where Q is the covariance operator.

A strong Itˆo functional Φ : U × R+ → R is said to be a Lyapunov functional

for the equation (5.2), if

(1) Φ(0, t) = 0 for all t ≥ 0, and, for any ε > 0, there is a δ > 0 such that

Φ(h, t) ≥ δ, and

LtΦ(v, t) ≤ 0.

Let uh

t be a strong solution of the equation (5.1) with uh

0 = h.

Deﬁnition 5.1. The solution uh

t is said to be nonexplosive if

for any T > 0. If the above holds for T = ∞, the solution is said to be ultimately

bounded.

Lemma 5.1. Let Φ : U × R+ → R+ be a Lyapunov functional and let uh

t denote the

strong solution of (5.2). For r > 0, let Br = {h ∈ V : khk < r} such that Br ⊂ U.

Deﬁne

τ = inf{t > 0 : uh

t ∈ Bc

r, h ∈ Br},

with Bc

r = V \Br. We put τ = T if the set is empty. Then the process φt =

Φ(uh

holds

Theorem 5.1. If there exists an Itˆo functional Ψ : V × R+ → R+ and a constant

α > 0 such that

LtΨ ≤ αΨ(v, t) for any v ∈ V,

and the inﬁmum inf t≥0,khk≥r Ψ(h, t) = Ψr exists such that limr→∞ Ψr = ∞, then the

solution uh

t does not explode in ﬁnite time.

Proof. Let Φ(v, t) = e−αtΨ(v, t). We have

LtΦ(v, t) =

Theorem 5.2. Let 1 < m < 2, 1 < n < 2 and the initial datum h(x) on D is

positive and continuous. Suppose that R ∞

Proof.

In view of the proof of Theorem 3-6.5 in [4, pp. 86] and the proof of

Theorem 3.2 in [6], we can show that the equation (5.1) has a local strong solution.

By Theorem 3.1, the solution is positive. Deﬁne Φ(v, t) = kvk2
