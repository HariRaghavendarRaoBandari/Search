Abstract. This is the second of two papers establishing structural properties of
R2, the structure giving rise to pure patterns of resemblance of order two, which
partially underly the results in [2] and [3] as well as other work in the area.

For the entire paper, we will assume ρ is an arbitrary additively indecom-
posable ordinal and α is an epsilon number greater than ρ. By Lemma 5.8
of [4], κρ

α is additively indecomposable.

The Order Reduction Theorem says that for η < θρ

α,η is essentially
isomorphic to an initial segment of Rα
2 . The important point is that this
reduction reduces the lengths of chains in ≤2: if the longest chain of elements
of J ρ
α,η with respect to ≤2 has length n + 1 where n ∈ ω then the longest
chain among the elements of the corresponding initial segment of Rα
2 with
respect to the analogue of ≤2 in Rα

2 has length at most n.

2(α), J ρ

The Second Recurrence Theorem for ≤2 says roughly that the initial seg-
ment of Rα
2 corresponding to Iωη grows by adding ρ new intervals of the form
I α
β each time η increases. In the case ρ = 1, which is essentially R2, this says
one new interval is added each time η increases.

Section 1 contains background.
Section 2 introduces the notion of local incompressibility.
Section 3 establishes the Order Reduction Theorem.
Section 4 establishes the Second Recurrence Theorem for ≤2.

1 Preliminaries

We will use the notation from [4] except we will need to be more careful
about parameters in deﬁnitions as we now discuss. As in [4], our metatheory

is KPω, Kripke-Platek set theory with the axiom of inﬁnity (see [1]).

2 , in Rσ

Assume X is a set of ordinals and σ is an additively indecomposable
ordinal. We will say that X is σ-closed if it is closed in Rσ (recall the
deﬁnition of closed from [4] which is not the same as being topologically
closed). We will say that a map h : X → ORD is a σ-covering of X if h is a
2 . Similarly, ˜X is a σ-covering of
covering of X, as a substructure of Rσ
X if ˜X is a covering of X when X and ˜X are viewed as a substructures of Rσ
2 .
Similary, we will say that h is a σ-embedding of X if h is an embedding of X,
as a substructure of Rσ
2 . We will say that h is a σ-isomorphism of X
and Y if h is an isomorphism of X and Y as substructures of Rσ
2 . We will say
X and Y are σ-isomorphic if there is a σ-isomorphism of X and Y . We will
also write X ∼=σ Y when X and Y are σ-isomorphic. On the other hand, we
will almost always use the notation κσ
β,ξ and
σ
β,ξ in the case σ = ρ and β = α. So, we continue to suppress parameters in
J
this case and write κξ, Iξ, θ1, index, θ2, νξ, Jξ and J ξ respectively.

which will be abbreviated as RTSI, implies the following.

Deﬁnition 2.1 Assume X is a set of ordinals. Let M be the collection of
ordinals µ such that µ is divisible by κα and X ∩ [µ, µ + κα) 6= ∅. For µ ∈ M,
there is a unique nonempty subset Rµ of κα such that X ∩[µ, µ+κα) = µ+Rµ.
The indexed family Rµ (µ ∈ M) will be called the interval decomposition
of X. If 0 ∈ Rµ and Rµ is incompressible for each µ ∈ M, we will say that
X is locally incompressible.

Notice that X is ρ-closed iﬀ Rµ is ρ-closed for all µ ∈ M. Moreover, X
is κα-closed iﬀ 0 ∈ Rµ for all µ ∈ M. Hence, if X is locally incompressible
then X is both ρ-closed and κα-closed.

Lemma 2.2 Assume X is a ﬁnite ρ-closed set of ordinals with interval de-
composition Rµ (µ ∈ M).

1. Assume X ′ has interval decomposition R′

ρ-incompressible ρ-covering of Rµ or R′

µ is either a
µ = Rµ for µ ∈ M then X ′ is a

2. Assume µ1 and µ2 are divisible by κα and µ1 ≤ µ2. If µ1 ≤ X < µ2 +κγ
where γ < α then there is a locally incompressible set X ′ such that
X ⊆ X ′ and µ1 ≤ X ′ < µ2 + κγ.

3. Assume X is locally incompressible. If h is a ρ-covering of X such that

h(µ) is divisible by κα for all µ ∈ M then

h(µ + χ) ≥ h(µ) + κγ

whenever χ ∈ Rµ and χ ∈ Iγ.

µ. Deﬁne h on X
Proof. For part 1, let hµ be the ρ-covering of Rµ onto R′
by h(µ + χ) = µ + hµ(χ) whenever χ ∈ Rµ. Since ρ divides κα, Lemma 2.4
of [4] implies h is an embedding of X into Rρ.

Notice that if µ ∈ M ∩ X then h(µ) = µ + hµ(0) = µ + 0 = µ (since

index(hµ(0)) ≤ index(0) = 0).

To show h is a ρ-covering, assume χi ∈ Rµi for i = 1, 2 and µ1 + χ1 <ρ

k

µ2 + χ2. We will show h(µ1 + χ1) ≤ρ

k h(µ2 + χ2).

First consider the case when χ1 6= 0. By RTSI, µ1 = µ2. Let µ be
k χ2. Since hµ is a ρ-covering,
k µ + hµ(χ2) i.e.

k hµ(χ2). By RTSI once again, µ + hµ(χ1) ≤ρ

the common value. By RTSI again, χ1 ≤ρ
hµ(χ1) ≤ρ
h(µ1 + χ1) ≤ρ

k h(µ2 + χ2).

Now consider the case when χ1 = 0.

If χ2 = 0 then h(µi) = µi for
i = 1, 2 from which the desired conclusion is trivial. Assume χ2 6= 0. By
RTSI, k = 1. Let γ = index(χ2). So, κγ ≤ χ2 ≤ max1(κγ). By RTSI,
µ2 + κγ≤ρ
1µ2 + max1(κγ). Since
index(hµ2(χ2)) ≤ γ, hµ2(χ2) ≤ max1(κγ). Therefore, h(µ1) = µ1≤ρ
1µ2 +
hµ2(χ2) = h(µ2 + χ2).

1µ2 + max1(κγ). Since µ1≤ρ

1µ2 + χ2, µ1≤ρ

For part 2, let Rµ (µ ∈ M) be the interval decomposition of X. For each
µ and
µ. One easily checks

µ ∈ M, let R′

µ]). Let X ′ = Sµ∈M R′

For part 3, assume µ ∈ M. Let Q1 = {χ ∈ Rµ | h(µ + χ) < h(µ) + κα}

and Q2 = Rµ − Q1. Clearly, Q1 < Q2.

We claim Q1 6≤ρ

1 Q2. Assume χi ∈ Qi for i = 1, 2. We will show χ1 6≤ρ χ2.

Since this is clear if χ1 = 0, we may assume 0 < χ1. Therefore,

h(µ) < h(µ + χ1) < h(µ) + κα ≤ h(µ + χ2)

By RTSI, h(µ + χ1) 6≤ρ
By RTSI again, χ1 6≤ρ

1 h(µ + χ2). Since h is a ρ-covering, µ + χ1 6≤ρ
1 χ2.

1 µ + χ2.

By part 8 of Lemma 6.4 of [4], Q1 is ρ-incompressible. Deﬁne f : Q1 → κα

by

h(µ + χ) = h(µ) + f (χ)

We claim f is a ρ-covering of Q1. Assume χ1, χ2 ∈ Q1 and χ1 <ρ
assumption implies 0 < χ1. By RTSI, µ + χ1 ≤ρ
ρ-covering, RTSI implies that f (χ1) ≤ρ

k χ2. The
k µ + χ2. Since h is a

k f (χ2).

To prove the conclusion of part 2, assume χ ∈ Rµ and χ ∈ Iγ. If χ ∈ Q2
the conclusion of part 2 is clear. So, we may assume χ ∈ Q1. Since f is a
ρ-covering of Q1 and Q1 is ρ-incompressible, index(f (χ)) ≥ index(χ) = γ.
Therefore, f (χ) ≥ κγ. By deﬁnition of f , this implies the desired conclusion.

Lemma 2.3 Assume λ is a limit ordinal, ν < λ is divisible by κα, X ⊆ ν is
a ﬁnite ρ-closed set and Y is a family of nonempty ﬁnite ρ-closed subsets of
λ such that

• Y is coﬁnal in λ.

• The elements of Y have the same cardinality.

• remρ[Y1] = remρ[Y2] for all Y1, Y2 ∈ Y.

For Y ∈ Y, let MY be the set of µ which are divisible by κα such that Y
intersects [µ, µ + κα). There exists ﬁnite R ⊆ κα and Y ′ ⊆ Y such that

1. R is ρ-incompressible and 0 ∈ R.

2. Y ′ is coﬁnal in λ.

3. There is a ρ-covering of X ∪ Y into X ∪ (MY + R) for all Y ∈ Y ′.

Proof. Assume Y ∈ Y. Let RY,µ (µ ∈ MY ) be the interval decomposi-
RY,µ ∪ {0}. Clearly, Y ⊆ MY + RY . Since
the elements of MY are divisible by κα which in turn is divisible by ρ,
remρ[MY,µ] ∪
{0} = remρ[Y ] ∪ {0}. Since remρ[Y ] is ﬁxed as Y varies over Y, so is
remρ[RY ].

tion of Y . Let RY = Sµ∈MY
remρ[Y ] =Sµ∈MY

remρ[MY,µ]. Therefore, remρ[RY ] =Sµ∈MY

Lemma 3.3 of [4] implies there exists Y ′ ⊆ Y which is coﬁnal in λ such
∼=ρ RY2 for all Y1, Y2 ∈ Y ′. Moreover, we may assume ν ≤ Y for
that RY1
Y ∈ Y ′. This implies that X < MY for Y ∈ Y ′. Let R be a ρ-incompressible
covering of RY for Y ∈ Y ′. Since RY is a subset of κα, so is R. Since 0 ∈ RY ,
0 ∈ R.

Assume Y ∈ Y ′. Part 1 of Lemma 2.2 implies X ∪ (MY + R) is a covering
of X ∪(MY +RY ). This implies there is a covering of X ∪Y into X ∪(MY +R).

3 The Order Reduction Theorem

Recall that we are assuming ρ is an arbitrary additively indecomposable
ordinal and α is an epsilon number greater than ρ.

We will see that if ξ1 < ξ2 < θ2 are additively indecomposable then Jξ1
is isomorphic to a proper initial segment of Jξ2. For the proof, we collapse
the ≤ρ
1 connectivity components of each small interval to single points. More
precisely, in Deﬁnition 3.1 below the interval νξ + κα · δ + Iγ is replaced by
the single point νξ + κα · δ + κγ when γ < α and νξ + κα · δ + κγ ∈ Jξ. We will
see that the resulting structure is essentially isomorphic to an initial segment
of Rα
2 and use that result to establish a second recurrence theorem for the
length of Jξ in the following section.

Deﬁnition 3.1 Deﬁne J
the form νξ + κα · δ + κγ where γ < α. The operation ια,ξ is the unique order

ϕξ : J ξ → dom(ιξ) by

′

ϕξ(νξ + κα · δ + χ) = α · δ + index(χ)

when χ < κα.

As usual, we should include the parameter ρ in the notation for ια,ξ and
α,ξ. Similarly for ϕξ. Since both ρ and α are clear from the context,

write ιρ
we will simply write ιξ and ϕξ.

The following observations will be used often.

• For all ordinals α · δ + γ in the domain of ιξ with γ < α,

implying

ιξ(α · δ + γ) = νξ + κα · δ + κγ

ιξ(α · δ + γ) = ιξ(α · δ) + κγ

• If σ ∈ dom(ιξ) is divisible by α then ιξ(σ) is divisible by κα.

• If µ ∈ J ξ is divisible by κα then µ ∈ J

ξ (µ) is divisible by α.

• ιξ is continuous and the domain of ιξ has a maximal element if it is

bounded.

• ϕξ is weakly order preserving i.e. if σ, τ ∈ J ξ and σ ≤ τ then ϕξ(σ) ≤

ϕξ(τ ).

• ϕξ extends ι−1

ξ and

ϕξ(µ + χ) = ι−1

ξ (µ) + index(χ)

whenever µ + χ ∈ J ξ, µ is divisible by κα and χ < κα.

• If λ is in the domain of ιξ then ιξ(λ) is the least σ such that ϕξ(σ) = λ.

• If Z is an α-closed subset of the domain of ιξ then ιξ[Z] is κα-closed.

• If Z is a κα-closed subset of J ξ then ϕξ[Z] is α-closed.

The second observation follows from the continuity of γ 7→ κγ.
The following lemma will be the key to the inductive proof of the Order

Reduction Theorem.

Lemma 3.2 Assume ξ < θ2, λ ∈ dom(ιξ) and

1. Assume Z ⊆ J is ﬁnite, ρ-closed and κα-closed with νξ ∈ Z. Also,
suppose g : ϕξ[Z] → λ is an α-covering of ϕξ[Z] with g(0) = 0. There
exists a ρ-covering g ′ : Z → ιξ(λ) which is an embedding of Z into Rκα
such that

(∗)

g ′(µ + χ) = (ιξ ◦ g ◦ ι−1

ξ )(µ) + χ

whenever µ + χ ∈ Z, µ is divisible by κα and χ < κα.

2. Assume Z ⊆ [0, λ] is α-closed and ιξ(λ) ∈ Jξ. Also, suppose Z ∗ ⊆ J
is locally incompressible, νξ ∈ Z ∗, ιξ[Z] ⊆ Z ∗ and h : Z ∗ → J is a
ρ-covering of Z ∗ with h(νξ) = νξ. There exists an α-covering h′ : Z →
[0, λ] such that

(∗∗)

h′(σ + γ) = (ι−1

whenever σ + γ ∈ Z, σ is divisible by α and γ < α.

3. Assume λ′ ∈ [1, λ]. λ′ ≤α

1 λ + 1 iﬀ λ + 1 is in the domain of ιξ and

ιξ(λ′) ≤ρ

1 ιξ(λ + 1).

Proof. Notice that J is an initial segment of J ξ. Let ˜δ and ˜γ be ordinals
such that λ = α · ˜δ + ˜γ and ˜γ < α. By part 13 of Lemma 8.6 of [4],
J = [νξ, νξ + κα · ˜δ + κ˜γ+1).

(Part 1) By Lemma 2.4 of [4], in order to show that (∗) deﬁnes an
embedding of Z into Rκα, it suﬃces to show that if µ ∈ Z is divisible by κα
then g ′(µ) is deﬁned and divisible by κα.

Assume µ ∈ Z is divisible by κα. Our assumption implies µ ∈ J

Therefore, g ′(µ) = ιξ(g(ι−1

ξ (µ))) is divisible by κα.

ξ (µ)) is divisible by α.

Since ρ divides κα, Z is ρ-closed and g ′ is an embedding of Z into Rκα,

g ′ is clearly an embedding of Z into Rρ.

To show that the range of g ′ is contained in ιξ(λ), assume µ+χ ∈ Z where
µ is divisible by κα and χ < κα. To establish g ′(µ + χ) < ιξ(λ), it suﬃces to
show ϕξ(g ′(µ + χ)) < λ. Let γ = index(χ). Since ϕξ(µ + χ) = ι−1

Since g ′ is an embedding of Z into Rκα, g ′(µi) is divisible by κα for i = 1, 2.
Case 1 of Part 1. Assume µ1 + χ1 = νξ.
Since g(0) = 0, one easily checks g ′(νξ) = νξ. So, we need to show
νξ ≤ρ
k g ′(µ2 + χ2). When k = 1 this follows from the fact that νξ ≤ρ
1 β for all
β ∈ J ξ. Suppose k = 2. Since νξ ≤ρ
2 µ2 + χ2, RTSI implies χ2 = 0. Since g ′ is
an embedding of Z into Rκα, g ′(µ2) is divisible by κα. Since g ′(µ2) < ιξ(λ),
g ′(µ2) ∈ Jξ. This implies that νξ ≤ρ

2 µ2.

Case 2 of Part 1. Assume µ1 + χ1 6= νξ, χ1 = 0 and χ2 6= 0.
By RTSI, we must have k = 1. Let γ = index(χ2). Since µ1 ≤ρ

1 µ2 + χ2

and κγ ≤ χ2,

µ1 ≤ρ

Since νξ < µ1 < µ2 + χ2, the assumptions of the lemma imply

Since index(χ2) = γ, κγ ≤ρ

1 χ2. RTSI impies

g ′(µ1) ≤ρ

1 g ′(µ2) + χ2

Therefore,

g ′(µ1) ≤ρ

1 g ′(µ2) + χ2 = g ′(µ2 + χ2)

Case 3 of Part 1. Assume µ1 + χ1 6= νξ and χ1 = χ2 = 0.
The assumptions of the lemma and the assumption that g is an α-covering

easily imply that g ′(µ1) ≤ρ

k g ′(µ2).

Case 4 of Part 1. Assume χ1 6= 0.
By RTSI, µ1 = µ2 and χ1 ≤ρ

k χ2. RTSI also implies g ′(µ1) + χ1 ≤ρ

k

g ′(µ1) + χ2 i.e. g ′(µ1 + χ1) ≤ρ

k g ′(µ2 + χ2).

(Part 2) Since ιξ(λ) ∈ Jξ, part 13 of Lemma 8.6 of [4] implies that

J ⊆ Jξ.

By parts 9 and 10 of Lemma 8.6 of [4], an element µ of Jξ is divisible by
2 µ. Since νξ ∈ Z ∗ and h ﬁxes νξ, h(µ) is divisible by κα whenever

κα iﬀ νξ ≤ρ
µ ∈ Z ∗ is divisible by κα.

By Lemma 2.4 of [4], in order to show that (∗∗) deﬁnes an embedding of
Z into Rα, it suﬃces to show that if σ ∈ Z is divisible by α then h′(σ) is
deﬁned and divisible by α.

Assume σ ∈ Z is divisible by α. Our assumption implies ιξ(σ) is divisible
by κα. Moreover, the assumptions of part 2 imply ιξ(σ) is in the domain
of h. By the remark above, h(ιξ(σ)) is divisible by κα. This implies that
h(ιξ(σ)) ∈ J

ξ (h(ιξ(σ))) is divisible by α.

ξ and h′(σ) = ι−1

′

Claim for Part 2. If σ + γ ∈ Z where σ is divisible by α and γ < α

then h′(σ + γ) ≤ ϕξ(h(ιξ(σ + γ))).

ϕξ(h(ιξ(σ + γ))) = ϕξ(h(ιξ(σ) + κγ))
≥ ϕξ(h(ιξ(σ)) + κγ)

(remarks before the lemma)
(part 3 of Lemma 2.2)

9

ξ (h(ιξ(σ))) + γ

= ι−1
= h′(σ) + γ
= h′(σ + γ)

(h(ιξ(σ)) is divisible by κα)

To see that the range of h′ is contained in [0, λ], assume σ + γ ∈ Z where
σ is divisible by α and γ < α. By the assumptions for part 2, ιξ(σ + γ) ∈ Z ∗
and h(ιξ(σ + γ)) ∈ J. By deﬁnition of J, ϕξ(h(ιξ(σ + γ))) ∈ [0, λ]. This and
the claim imply h′(σ + γ) ≤ λ.

To complete the proof of part 2, assume σi + γi ∈ Z where σi is divisible

by α and γi < α for i = 1, 2 and

σ1 + γ1 <α

k σ2 + γ2

We will show h′(σ1 + γ1) ≤α
and σ1 6= 0.

k h′(σ2 + γ2). Our assumption implies that γ1 = 0

Case 1 of Part 2. Assume γ2 6= 0.
By RTSI, k = 1. By the assumptions of the lemma,

ιξ(σ1) ≤ρ

1 ιξ(σ2 + γ2) = ιξ(σ2) + κγ2

Since h is a ρ-covering,

h(ιξ(σ1)) ≤ρ

1 h(ιξ(σ2) + κγ2)

By part 3 of Lemma 2.2, h(ιξ(σ2)) + κγ2 ≤ h(ιξ(σ2) + κγ2). Therefore,

h(ιξ(σ1)) ≤ρ

1 h(ιξ(σ2)) + κγ2

Since σ1 6= 0, νξ = ιξ(0) < ιξ(σ1) implying 0 ≤ h(νξ) < h(ιξ(σ1)). Since
h(ιξ(σ2)) + κγ2 is in the domain of ι−1
ξ

, this implies

h′(σ1) ≤α

1 h′(σ2 + γ2)

by the assumptions of the lemma and the deﬁnition of h′.

Case 2 of Part 2. Assume γ2 = 0.
The assumptions the lemma and the assumption that h is a ρ-covering

easily imply the desired conclusion.

(Part 3)
(⇒) Assume λ′ ≤α

1 λ + 1. Recall that λ = α · ˜δ + ˜γ where ˜γ < α and
J = [νξ, τ ) where τ = νξ + κα · ˜δ + κ˜γ+1. Notice that if λ + 1 were in the

10

domain of ιξ then ιξ(λ + 1) = τ . By Lemma 3.1 of [4], λ′ is a limit multiple
of α implying ιξ(λ′) is a limit multiple of κα.

Claim for (⇒) of part 3. Assume X ⊆ ιξ(λ′) and Y ⊆ [ιξ(λ′), τ ) are
ﬁnite sets which are both ρ-closed and κα-closed. There exists a ρ-covering
of X ∪ Y into ιξ(λ′) which ﬁxes X and is an embedding of X ∪ Y into Rκα.
Let X0 be the set whose elements are νξ along with the set of all µ ∈ X
such that µ ≤ρ
2 µ′ for some µ′ ∈ Y . By Lemma 3.9 of [4], it suﬃces to ﬁnd a
ρ-covering of X0 ∪ Y into ιξ(λ′) which is an embedding of X0 ∪ Y into Rκα,
ﬁxes X0 and maps Y above X (clearly, the extension of such a ρ-covering of
X0 ∪ Y to X ∪ Y which ﬁxes the elements of X will still be an embedding
into Rκα).

By part 4 of Lemma 8.6 of [4], νξ ≤ X0. By RTSI, each element of X0 is

divisible by κα implying X0 is both ρ-closed and κα-closed.

Since X0 and Y are both ρ-closed and κα-closed, X0 ∪ Y is both ρ-closed
and κα-closed. By the remarks preceding the previous lemma, ϕξ[X0] and
ϕξ[Y ] are α-closed.

If β ∈ X ∩ J ξ then, since β < ιξ(λ′), ϕξ(β) < λ′. Since λ′ ≤α

1 λ, there is
an α-covering g of ϕξ[X0] ∪ ϕξ[Y ] into λ′ which ﬁxes ϕξ[X0] and maps ϕξ[Y ]
above ϕξ(β) for all β ∈ X ∩ J ξ. Since νξ ∈ X0, 0 ∈ ϕξ[X0] and g(0) = 0.
By part 1, there is a ρ-covering g ′ : X0 ∪ Y → ιξ(λ) which is an embedding
of X0 ∪ Y into Rκα such that g ′(µ + χ) = (ιξ ◦ g ◦ ι−1
ξ )(µ) + χ whenever
µ + χ ∈ X0 ∪ Y , µ is divisible by κα and χ < κα.

To see that g ′ ﬁxes the elements of X0, suppose µ + χ ∈ X0 where µ is
divisible by κα and χ < κα. Since all elements of X0 are divisible by κα,
χ = 0. Since g ﬁxes elements of ϕξ[X0] = ι−1
ξ

[X0], g ′ clearly ﬁxes µ.

To see that g ′ maps Y above X, it is enough to show g ′ maps Y above
X ∩ J ξ. Suppose β ∈ X ∩ J ξ and µ + χ ∈ Y where µ is divisible by
κα and χ < κα. To show β < g ′(µ + χ), it suﬃces to show β < g ′(µ).
Since g ′(µ) = ιξ(g(ι−1
ξ (µ)). Since
ι−1
ξ (µ) = ϕξ(µ) (by one of the the observations before the lemma), this
follows from the choice of g.

ξ (µ))), it suﬃces to have ϕξ(β) < g(ι−1

To see that g ′ maps Y into ιξ(λ′), assume µ + χ ∈ Y where µ is divisible
by κα and χ < κα. We will show g ′(µ + χ) < ιξ(λ′). Since ιξ(λ′) is a multiple
of κα and g ′(µ + χ) = g ′(µ) + χ, it suﬃces to show g ′(µ) < ιξ(λ′). Since
g ′(µ) = ιξ(g(ι−1

ξ (µ))), this follows from the fact that g(ι−1

ξ (µ)) < λ′.

This completes the proof of the claim.
To show that ιξ(λ′) ≤ρ

ρ-closed sets. We will show there is a ρ-covering of X ∪ Y into ιξ(λ′) which
ﬁxes X.

Let X + be the union of X with the collection of µ which are divisible by
κα such that X intersects [µ, µ + κα). Since κα is divisible by ρ, X + is both
ρ-closed and κα-closed. Clearly, X + ⊆ ιξ(λ′). Similarly, let Y + be the union
of Y with the collection of µ which are divisible by κα such that Y intersects
[µ, µ + κα). As with X +, Y + is both ρ-closed and κα-closed.

By the claim, there is a ρ-covering of X + ∪ Y + into ιξ(λ′) which ﬁxes X +.

The restriction to X ∪ Y is the desired ρ-covering of X ∪ Y .

We still need to show λ + 1 is in the domain of ιξ. For this, it suﬃces to

show τ ∈ J ξ.

First consider the case when ξ + 1 = θ2. Since ιξ(λ′) ≤ρ

1 τ and ιξ(λ′) ∈ Iα,

τ ∈ Iα implying τ ∈ Jξ = J ξ.

Suppose ξ + 1 < θ2. In this case, J ξ = [νξ, νξ+1]. Argue by contradic-
tion and assume that τ 6∈ J ξ. This implies νξ+1 < τ . We will derive a
contradiction by showing this implies νξ ≤ρ

By part 14 of Lemma 8.6 of [4], νξ ≤ρ
To show νξ ≤ρ

1 νξ whenever ζ ∈ Y and ζ ≤ρ

2↓, assume X ⊆ νξ and Y ⊆ [νξ, νξ+1) are ﬁnite ρ-closed
sets. We will show there is a ρ-covering h of X ∪ Y into νξ which ﬁxes X such
that h(ζ) ≤ρ
1 νξ+1. As above, there exists ﬁnite
X + ⊆ νξ containing X which is both ρ-close and κα-closed, and there exists
ﬁnite Y + ⊆ [νξ, νξ+1) containing Y which is both ρ-closed and κα-closed. We
may assume νξ ∈ Y +. Let Y1 = Y + ∩ [νξ, ιξ(λ′)) and Y2 = Y + ∩ [ιξ(λ′), νξ+1).
Clearly, Y1 and Y2 are both ρ-closed and κα-closed. By the claim, there is a ρ-
covering h1 of X +∪Y1∪Y2∪{νξ+1} into ιξ(λ′) which is an embedding into Rκα
and ﬁxes X + ∪ Y1. Since h1 is an embedding into Rκα, h1(νξ+1) is divisible
by κα. Moreover, νξ = h1(νξ) < h1(νξ+1) < ιξ(λ′) < ιξ(λ) ≤ νξ+1. Therefore,
νξ ≤ρ
2 h1(νξ+1). This implies there is a ρ-covering h2 of X + ∪ Y1 ∪ h1[Y2]
into νξ which ﬁxes X + such that h2(ζ) ≤ρ
1 νξ whenever ζ ∈ Y1 ∪ h1[Y2] and
ζ ≤ρ
1 h1(νξ+1). The composition of h1 and h2 restricted to X ∪ Y is the
desired ρ-covering h.

Let X0 consist of 0 along with those σ in X such that σ ≤α

2 σ′ for some
σ′ ∈ Y . By Lemma 3.9 of [4], it suﬃces to ﬁnd a covering of X0 ∪ Y into λ′

12

which ﬁxes X0 and maps the elements of Y above X.

By Lemma 3.1 of [4], each element of X0 is a multiple of α. Therefore,
each element of ιξ[X0] is a multiple of κα. This implies that ιξ[X0] is locally
incompressible. Since 0 ∈ X0, νξ = ιξ(0) ∈ ιξ[X0].

By part 2 of Lemma 2.2, there is a ﬁnite subset Y ∗ of [ιξ(λ′), ιξ(λ + 1))
which is locally incompressible such that ιξ[Y ] ⊆ Y ∗. Since both ιξ[X0] and
Y ∗ are locally incompressible, ιξ[X0] ∪ Y ∗ is locally incompressible.

Since ιξ(λ′) ≤ρ

1 ιξ(λ + 1), there is a ρ-covering h of ιξ[X0] ∪ Y ∗ into ιξ(λ′)
which ﬁxes ιξ[X0] and maps Y ∗ above ιξ(ζ) for each ζ ∈ X. By part 2, there
is an α-covering h′ of X0∪Y into [0, λ] such that h′(σ+γ) = (ι−1
ξ ◦h◦ιξ)(σ)+γ
whenever σ + γ ∈ X0 ∪ Y , σ is divisible by α and γ < α.

To see that h′ ﬁxes X0, assume σ + γ ∈ X0 where σ is divisible by α
and γ < α. Since each element of X0 is a multiple of α, γ = 0. Since
ιξ(σ) ∈ ιξ[X0] and ιξ[X0] is ﬁxed by h, σ is ﬁxed by h′.

To see that h′ maps Y above X, assume ζ ∈ X and σ + γ ∈ Y where σ is
divisible by α and γ < α. Since σ ∈ Y , it suﬃces to show ζ < h′(σ). Since
ιξ(σ) ∈ Y ∗, ιξ(ζ) < h(ιξ(σ)) by choice of h. Applying ι−1

, ζ < ι−1

To see that h′ maps Y into λ′, assume σ + γ ∈ Y where σ is divisible by
α and γ < α. Since λ′ is divisible by κα and h′(σ + γ) = h′(σ) + γ, to show
h′(σ + γ) < λ′ it suﬃces to establish that h′(σ) < λ′. This follows from the
deﬁnition of h′ and the fact that h(ιξ(σ)) < ιξ(λ′).

Proof. Let K be the collection of ordinals λ in the domain of ιξ such that
for k = 1, 2 and all λ′ ∈ [1, λ), (⋆) holds. We will show that K = dom(ιξ) by
induction.

Assume λ ∈ dom(ιξ) and λ′ ∈ K for all λ′ < λ.
First, suppose k = 1 and assume λ′ ∈ [1, λ). If λ is a limit ordinal then
(⋆) follows from the induction hypothesis using the continuity of ιξ and part
2 of Lemma 3.8 of [4]. On the other hand, if λ is a successor ordinal then (⋆)
follows from part 3 of Lemma 3.2.

We now consider the case k = 2. Assume λ′ ∈ [1, λ).

2 λ.

(⇒) Assume λ′ ≤α
By Lemma 3.1 of [4] and part 1 of Lemma 3.6 of [4], both λ′ and λ are
limit multiples of α. Therefore, both ιξ(λ′) and ιξ(λ) are limit multiples of
κα.

We ﬁrst show that ιξ(λ′) ≤ρ

2↓ ιξ(λ). The proof is similar to the forward

direction of part 3 of Lemma 3.2.

Assume X ⊆ ιξ(λ′) and Y ⊆ [ιξ(λ′), ιξ(λ)) are ﬁnite ρ-closed sets. Let X0
be the set whose elements are νξ along with all µ ∈ X such that µ ≤ρ
2 µ′ for
some µ′ ∈ Y . By Lemma 3.9 of [4], it suﬃces to ﬁnd a ρ-covering f of X0 ∪ Y
into ιξ(λ′) which ﬁxes X0 and maps Y above X such that f (µ) ≤ρ
1 ιξ(λ′)
whenever µ ∈ Y and µ ≤ρ

1 ιξ(λ).

By part 4 of Lemma 8.6 of [4], νξ ≤ X0. By RTSI, each element of X0 is

divisible by κα implying X0 is both ρ-closed and κα-closed.

Let Y + be the union of Y with the collection of µ which are divisible by
κα such that Y intersects [µ, µ + κα). Since κα is divisible by ρ, Y + is both
ρ-closed and κα-closed. Since ιξ(λ′) is divisible by κα, Y + ⊆ [ιξ(λ′), ιξ(λ)).

Without loss of generality, we may replace Y by Y +
Since λ′ ≤α

2 λ, there is a covering g of ϕξ[X0] ∪ ϕξ[Y +] into λ′ such that g
1 λ′ whenever

ﬁxes ϕξ[X0], ϕξ(β) < g[ϕξ[Y +]] for each β ∈ X ∩ J ξ and g(σ) ≤α
σ ∈ ϕξ[Y ] and σ ≤α

1 λ.

Since νξ ∈ X0, 0 = ϕξ(νξ) ∈ ϕξ[X0] and g(0) = 0.
By part 1 of Lemma 3.2, there is a ρ-covering g ′ of X0 ∪ Y + such that
ξ ◦ g ◦ ιxi)(µ) + χ whenever µ + χ ∈ X0 ∪ Y +, µ is divisible by

g ′(µ + χ) = (ι−1
κα and χ < κα.

By a straightforward argument similar to that in the forward direction
of part 3 of Lemma 3.2, g ′ maps X0 ∪ Y + into ιξ(λ′), ﬁxes X and maps Y
above X.

Suppose µ ∈ Y + and µ ≤ρ

1 ιξ(λ). Since ιξ(λ) is a multiple of κα, µ must
be a multiple of κα by RTSI. Therefore, µ is in the range of ιξ and, by the
case k = 1, ι−1

by the induction hypothesis.

1 λ′ implying g ′(µ) ≤ρ

The restriction of g ′ to X0 ∪ Y is the desired ρ-covering f .
We now show ιξ(λ′) ≤ρ
Assume X is a ﬁnite ρ-closed subset of ιξ(λ′) and Y is a collection of
ﬁnite ρ-closed sets which is coﬁnal in ιξ(λ′) such that X < Y for Y ∈ Y and
∼=ρ X ∪ Y2 for all Y1, Y2 ∈ Y. Also, suppose β < ιξ(λ). We will show

there is Y ∈ Y and a covering of X ∪ Y into ιξ(λ) which ﬁxes X and maps

Y above β. This suﬃces by Lemma 3.4 of [4].

Since λ is a limit multiple of α and ιξ is continuous, we may assume there
is β ′ < λ which is a multiple of α such that β = ιξ(β ′). Moreover, we may
assume λ′ < β ′. Our assumptions imply β is a multiple of κα.

Let X0 be the set whose elements are νξ along with those µ ∈ X such
that for each Y ∈ Y there exists µ′ ∈ Y such that µ ≤ρ
2 µ′. As before,
νξ ≤ X0. Also, each element of X0 is divisible by κα implying X0 is locally
incompressible. In particular, X0 is both ρ-closed and κα-closed.

Since ιξ(λ′) is a limit multiple of κα, there is ν < ιξ(λ′) which is a multiple

of κα such that X0 < ν. We may assume ν ≤ Y for Y ∈ Y.

By Lemma 3.10 of [4], it suﬃces to show that there exists Y ∈ Y and a

covering of X0 ∪ Y into ιξ(λ) which ﬁxes X0 and maps Y above β.

For Y ∈ Y, let MY be the set of µ such that µ is divisible by κα and Y

intersects [µ, µ + κα).

Since X ∪ Y1

∼=ρ X ∪ Y2 for Y1, Y2 ∈ Y, remρ[Y ] and card(Y ) are constant
as Y varies over Y. By Lemma 2.3 there is a ρ-incompressible subset R of κα
and Y ′ ⊆ Y such that 0 ∈ R, Y ′ is coﬁnal in ιξ(λ′), and there is a ρ-covering
of X0 ∪ Y into X0 ∪ (MY + R) for all Y ∈ Y ′.

Since 0 ∈ R, MY + R is locally incompressible for Y ∈ Y ′. In particular,

MY + R is both ρ-closed and κα-closed for Y ∈ Y ′.

Assume Y ∈ Y ′. Since X0 and MY +R are κα-closed, ϕξ[X0]∪ϕξ[MY +R]
[MY ]+index[R]

is α-closed. Moreover, ϕξ[MY +R] = ϕξ[MY ]+index[R] = ι−1
ξ
implying remα[ϕξ[MY + R]] = index[R].

Since remα[ϕξ[MY + R]] is ﬁxed as Y ranges over Y ′, Lemma 3.3 of [4]
implies there is a subcollection Y ′′ of Y ′ which is coﬁnal in ιξ(λ′) such that
ϕξ[X0] ∪ ϕξ[MY1 + R] ∼=α ϕξ[X0] ∪ ϕξ[MY2 + R] for all Y1, Y2 ∈ Y ′′.

Since ιξ(λ′) is a limit multiple of κα and Y ′′ is coﬁnal in ιξ(λ′), we clearly
have that MY (Y ∈ Y ′′) is coﬁnal in ιξ(λ′). This implies that ϕξ[MY + R]
(Y ∈ Y ′′) is coﬁnal in λ′.

Assume Y ∈ Y ′′. Since λ′ ≤α

2 λ, there is an α-covering g of ϕξ[X0] ∪
ϕξ[MY + R] into λ which ﬁxes ϕξ[X0] such that β ′ < g[ϕξ[MY + R]]. Since
νξ ∈ X0, 0 = ϕξ(νξ) ∈ ϕξ[X0]. Therefore, g(0) = 0. By part 1 of Lemma 3.2,
there is a ρ-covering g ′ of X0 ∪ (MY + R) into ιξ(λ) such that g ′(µ + χ) =
(ιξ ◦ g ◦ ι−1
ξ )(µ) + χ whenever µ + χ ∈ X0 ∪ (MY + R), µ is divisible by κα
and χ < κα.

A straightforward argument shows g ′ ﬁxes each element of X0, being
divisible by κα, and g ′ maps each element of MY , hence of MY + R, above
ιξ(β ′).

(⇐) Assume ιξ(λ′) ≤ρ

of [4], λ′ is a limit multiple of α implying ιξ(λ′) is a limit multiple of κα. By
RTSI, ιξ(λ) is a multiple of κα implying λ is a multiple of α.

2 ιξ(λ). By the case k = 1, λ′ ≤α

We ﬁrst show λ′ ≤α

2 ↓ λ. The proof is similar to that of the reverse

direction of part 3 of Lemma 3.2.

Assume X ⊆ λ′ and Y ⊆ [λ′, λ) are ﬁnite α-closed sets. We will show
1 λ′

there is an α-covering h′ of X ∪ Y in λ′ which ﬁxes X such that h′(σ) ≤α
whenever σ ∈ Y and σ ≤α

1 λ.

Let X0 be the set whose elements are 0 along with those σ in X such that
σ ≤α
2 σ′ for some σ′ ∈ Y . By Lemma 3.9 of [4], it suﬃces to ﬁnd a covering
h′ of X0 ∪ Y into λ′ which ﬁxes X0 and maps the elements of Y above X
such that h′(σ) ≤α

1 λ′ whenever σ ∈ Y and σ ≤α

1 λ.

By Lemma 3.1 of [4], each element of X0 is a multiple of α. Therefore,
each element of ιξ[X0] is a multiple of κα. This implies that ιξ[X0] is locally
incompressible. Since 0 ∈ X0, νξ = ιξ(0) ∈ ιξ[X0].

By part 2 of Lemma 2.2, there is a ﬁnite subset Y ∗ of [ιξ(λ′), ιξ(λ)) which
is locally incompressible such that ιξ[Y ] ⊆ Y ∗. Since both ιξ[X0] and Y ∗ are
locally incompressible, ιξ[X0] ∪ Y ∗ is locally incompressible.

Since ιξ(λ′) ≤ρ

ﬁxes ιξ[X0] and maps Y ∗ above ιξ(ζ) for each ζ ∈ X such that h(µ) ≤ρ
whenever µ ∈ Y ∗ and µ ≤ρ
α-covering h′ of X0 ∪ Y into λ such that h′(σ + γ) = (ι−1

ξ ◦ h ◦ ιξ)(σ) + γ

As in the proof of the reverse direction of part 3 of Lemma 3.2, h′ is a

covering of X0 ∪ Y into λ′ which ﬁxes X0 and maps Y above X.

Assume σ ∈ Y and σ ≤α

1 ιξ(λ′). By the induction hypothesis and the deﬁnition of h′,

We now show that λ′ ≤α
Assume X is a ﬁnite α-closed subset of λ′ and Y is a collection of
nonempty ﬁnite α-closed subsets of λ′ which is coﬁnal in λ′ such that X < Y
∼=α X ∪ Y2 whenever Y1, Y2 ∈ Y. Also, suppose
for all Y ∈ Y and X ∪ Y1
that β < λ. We will show that there is Y ∈ Y and an α-covering of X ∪ Y
into λ which ﬁxes X and maps Y above β. We may assume that λ′ ≤ β.

Let X0 be the set whose elements are 0 along with those σ ∈ X such
that for each Y ∈ Y there exists σ′ ∈ Y such that σ ≤α
ρ σ′. By Lemma
3.1 of [4], each element of X0 is a multiple of α. Therefore, each element of

16

ιξ[X0] is divisible by κα implying that ιξ[X0] is locally incompressible. Also,
νξ = ιξ(0) ∈ ιξ[X0].

By Lemma 3.10 of [4], it suﬃces to show that there exists Y ∈ Y and a

covering of X0 ∪ Y into ιξ(λ) which ﬁxes X0 and maps Y above β.

Since X ∪ Y1

∼=α X ∪ Y2 for all Y1, Y2 ∈ Y, remα[Y1] = remα[Y2] for all
Y1, Y2 ∈ Y. Let R be the common value of remα[Y ] as Y ranges of Y. Since
each element of Y is α-closed, 0 ∈ R.

Assume Y ∈ Y. Let MY consist of the elements of Y which are divisible
by α. Since Y is α-closed, Y ⊆ MY + R. Since 0 ∈ R, MY + R is α-closed.
Notice that ιξ[MY + R] = ιξ[MY ] + {κγ | γ ∈ R} and the elements of

ιξ[MY ] are divisible by κα for Y ∈ Y. Since 0 ∈ R, 0 = κ0 ∈ {κγ | γ ∈ R}.

By Lemma 6.7 of [4], there is a ρ-incompressible set R∗ which contains
{κγ | γ ∈ R} such that index(max(R∗)) is the largest element of R. Since
0 ∈ {κγ | γ ∈ R}, 0 ∈ R∗.

Assume Y ∈ Y. By choice of R∗, ιξ[MY + R] ⊆ ιξ[MY ] + R∗. Since
the elements of ιξ[MY ] are divisible by κα and 0 ∈ R∗, ιξ[MY ] + R∗ is locally
incompressible. Since both ιξ[X0] and ιξ[MY ]+R∗ are locally incompressible,
ιξ[X0] ∪ (ιξ[MY ] + R∗) is locally incompressible. Since ιξ(λ′) is divisible by
κα and MY < λ′, ιξ[MY ] + R∗ < ιξ(λ′). Using the fact that the elements of
ιξ[MY ] are divisible by κα again, remρ[ιξ[MY ] + R∗] = remρ[R∗].

Since remρ[ιξ[MY ] + R∗] is ﬁxed as Y varies over Y, Lemma 3.3 of [4],
implies there is a subcollection Y ′ of Y which is coﬁnal in λ′ such that ιξ[X0]∪
(ιξ[MY1]+R∗) ∼=ρ ιξ[X0]∪(ιξ[MY2]+R∗) for all Y1, Y2 ∈ Y ′. Since min(MY ) ∈
Y for Y ∈ Y, min(MY ) (Y ∈ Y ′) is coﬁnal in λ′. By the continuity of ιξ,
ιξ(min(MY )) (Y ∈ Y ′) is coﬁnal in ιξ(λ′). Therefore, ιξ[MY ] + R∗ (Y ∈ Y ′)
is coﬁnal in ιξ(λ′).

Fix Y ∈ Y ′. Since ιξ(λ′) ≤ρ

2 ιξ(λ), there is a ρ-covering of ιξ[X0]∪(ιξ[MY ]+
R∗) into ιξ(λ) which ﬁxes ιξ[X0] and maps ιξ[MY ] + R∗ above ιξ(β). Since
νξ ∈ ιξ[X0], h(νξ) = νξ. By part 2 of Lemma 3.2, there is an α-covering h′ of
X0 ∪ (MY + R) into λ such that h′(σ + γ) = (ι−1
ξ ◦ h ◦ ιξ)(σ) + γ whenever
σ + γ ∈ X0 ∪ (MY + R), σ is divisible by α and γ < α.

Since the elements of X0 are divisible by α, an easy argument shows X0

is ﬁxed by h′.

To show that h′ maps MY + R above β, it suﬃces to show h′ maps the
elements of MY above β. This is straightforward from the deﬁnition of h′
and the fact that the elements of MY are divisible by α and h maps ιξ[MY ]
above ιξ(β).

4 The Second Recurrence Theorem for ≤2

Recall that we are assuming ρ is an arbitrary additively indecomposable
ordinal and α is an epsilon number greater than ρ.

Lemma 4.1 If η1 < η2 and ωη2 < θ2 then Jωη1 is ρ-isomorphic to a proper
initial segment of Jωη2 .

Proof. Deﬁne λi so that Jωηi = [νωηi , νωηi + λi) for i = 1, 2. Notice that λ2
may be ∞. Let λ be the minimum of λ1 and λ2.

Claim. The map from [νωη1 , νωη1 + λ) to [νωη2 , νωη2 + λ) given by

νωη1 + β 7→ νωη2 + β

is a ρ-isomorphism.

As substructures of Rρ, both [νωη1 , νωη1 + λ) and [νωη2 , νωη2 + λ) are iso-
morphic to initial segments of Rρ implying [νωη1 , νωη1 + λ) is isomorphic to
[νωη2 , νωη2 + λ) as substructures of Rρ.

Suppose κα · δj + χj < λ and χj < κα for j = 1, 2. We need to show

νωη1 + κα · δ1 + χ1 ≤ρ

k νωη1 + κα · δ2 + χ2

iﬀ

νωη2 + κα · δ1 + χ1 ≤ρ

k νωη2 + κα · δ2 + χ2

for k = 1, 2. This follows from RTSI when χ1 6= 0 and from the Order
Reduction Theorem when χ1 = χ2 = 0. Assume χ1 = 0 and χ2 6= 0. By
RTSI, both sides of the equivalence fail if k = 2. So, we may assume k = 1.
By RTSI again, νωηi + κα · δ2 + κγ ≤ρ
1 νωηi + κα · δ2 + χ2 for i = 1, 2 where
γ = index(χ2). Therefore, νωηi + κα · δ1 ≤ρ
1 νωηi + κα · δ2 + χ2 is equivalent to
νωηi + κα · δ1 ≤ρ
1 νωηi + κα · δ2 + κγ for i = 1, 2. The Order Reduction Theorem
implies that νωηi + κα · δ1 ≤ρ
1 α · δ2 + γ for
i = 1, 2. The desired equivalence follows.

1 νωηi + κα · δ2 + κγ iﬀ α · δ1 ≤α

Argue by contradiction and assume λ2 ≤ λ1.
Notice that Jωη1 = [νωη1 , νωη1 +1) implying νωη1 + λ1 = νωη1 +1 and λ1 is

divisible by κα.

First, assume that ωη2+1 = θ2. In this case, Jωη2 = J ωη2 = [νωη2 , max(Iα)].

We will derive a contradiction by showing νωη2 ≤ρ

1 max(Iα) + 1.

Assume X ⊆ νωη2 and Y ⊆ Jωη2 are ﬁnite ρ-closed sets. We will show
there is a ρ-covering of X ∪ Y into νωη2 which ﬁxes X. By part 4 of Lemma
8.6 of [4], X 6≤ρ
2 Y . By Lemma 3.9 of [4], it will suﬃce to ﬁnd a ρ-covering of
Y into νωη2 which maps Y above X. By the claim, Jωη1 contains a ρ-closed
set which is ρ-isomorphic to Y . By the continuity of ξ 7→ νξ, there exists
η < ωη2 such that X < νη. Since η, ωη1 < ωη2, η + ωη1 < ωη2. By the First
Recurrence Theorem for ≤2, Jη+ωη1 ∼=ρ Jωη1 . Therefore, Jη+ωη1 contains a
ρ-closed set ˜Y which is ρ-isomorphic to Y . Since X < νη < ˜Y < νωη2 , the
ρ-isomorphism of Y and ˜Y is the desired ρ-covering of Y .

Now, suppose ωη2 + 1 < θ2. We will derive a contradiction by showing
2 νωη2 +1. In this case, Jωη2 = [νωη2 , νωη2 +1) and νωη2 +1 = νωη2 + λ2.

νωη2 ≤ρ
Therefore, λ2 is divisible by κα.

To show νωη2 ≤ρ

of Lemma 8.6 of [4], X 6≤ρ
2 Y . By Lemma 3.9 of [4], it will suﬃce to ﬁnd a
ρ-covering h of Y into νωη2 which maps Y above X such that h(β) ≤ρ
1 νωη2
whenever β ∈ Y and β ≤ρ
1 νωη2 +1. Let R satisfy Y = νωη2 +R. Clearly, R is ρ-
closed. Choose η < ωη2 such that X < νη. Let ξ = η+ωη1. Since η, ωη1 < ωη2,
ξ < ωη2. By the First Recurrence Theorem for ≤2, Jωη1 ∼=ρ Jξ. This implies
νξ+1 = νξ + λ1. By the claim, Jωη2 is ρ-isomorphic to an initial segment of
Jξ. Therefore, νξ + R ∼=ρ νωη2 + R = Y . Also, X < νξ + R < νξ+1 ≤ νωη2 .

We consider two cases.
First, suppose λ = λ1 = λ2.
We claim the ρ-isomorphism νωη2 + ζ 7→ νξ + ζ is the desired ρ-covering
of Y . To establish this, suppose ζ ∈ R and νωη2 + ζ ≤ρ
1 νωη2 +1. We will show
that νξ + ζ ≤ρ
1 νωη2 + ζ ′
whenever ζ ≤ ζ ′ < λ2. Since Jωη2 is ρ-isomorphic to an initial segment of
Jξ, νξ + ζ ≤ρ
1 νξ + ζ ′ whenever ζ ≤ ζ ′ < λ2. By part 2 of Lemma 3.8 of [4],
νξ + ζ ≤ρ

1 νωη2 +1 = νωη2 + λ, νωη2 + ζ ≤ρ

1 νωη2 . Since νωη2 + ζ ≤ρ

1 νξ + λ = νξ+1 ≤ρ

1 νωη2 .

Now, consider the case when λ2 < λ1. Since λ2 is divisible by κα, so is
νξ + λ2. Since νξ + λ2 < νξ + λ1 = νξ+1, this implies νξ ≤ρ
2 νξ + λ2. Therefore,
there is a ρ-covering g of νξ + R into νξ which maps νξ + R above X such
that g(νξ + ζ) ≤ρ
1 νξ whenever ζ ∈ R. Let h be the function on Y deﬁned by
h(νωη2 + ζ) = g(νξ + ζ). Clearly, h is a ρ-covering of Y .

To complete the proof of this case, assume ζ ∈ R and νωη2 + ζ ≤ρ

1 νωη2 +1.
1 νξ + λ2. Therefore,
(cid:3)

By an argument similar to the previous case, νξ + ζ ≤ρ
h(νωη2 + ζ) = g(νξ + ζ) ≤ρ

1 νξ ≤ρ

1 νωη2 .

Lemma 4.2 Assume ωη < θ2. If η′ < η then dom(ιωη′ ) ⊆ dom(ιωη ).

Proof. Assume η′ < η.

Since νωη′ +1 is the largest element of J ωη′ , ϕωη′ (νωη′ +1) is the largest ele-
ment of the domain of ιωη′ . Since νωη′ +1 is divisible by κα, there exists δ such
that νωη′ +1 = νωη′ + κα · δ. Therefore, ϕωη′ (νωη′ + κα · δ) = α · δ is the largest
element of the domain of ιωη′ . Since Jωη′ is ρ-isomorphic to a proper initial
segment of Jωη by Lemma 4.1, Jωη′ is ρ-isomorphic to [νωη , νωη + κα · δ) and
νωη + κα · δ ∈ Jωη . Therefore, α · δ = ϕωη(νωη + κα · δ) is in the domain of ιωη .
Since α · δ is the largest element of the domain of ιωη′ , dom(ιωη′ ) ⊆ dom(ιωη ).
(cid:3)

Lemma 4.3 Assume ξ < θ2 and νξ <ρ
2 ν. If Y ⊆ [νξ, ν) is ρ-closed and
νξ ∈ Y then there exists η such that ωη < ξ and a ρ-covering h of Y into Jωη
such that h(νξ) = νωη and h(µ) ≤ρ

1 νωη+1 whenever µ ∈ Y and µ ≤ρ

1 ν.

Proof. Assume Y ⊆ [νξ, ν) is ρ-closed and νξ ∈ Y .

Since νξ <ρ

2 ν, parts 1 and 11 of Lemma 8.6 of [4] imply ξ is a limit
ordinal. Therefore, there is a ρ-covering h1 of Y into νξ such that ν1 < h1[Y ]
and h1(µ) ≤ρ

1 νξ whenever µ ∈ Y and µ ≤ρ

1 ν.

There exists ξ ′ < ξ such that h1(νξ) ∈ Jξ ′. Since ν1 < h1[Y ], 1 ≤ ξ ′.
Deﬁne a function h2 on the range of h1 such that

h2(β + ǫ) =(νξ ′ + ǫ

β + ǫ

if β = h1(νξ)
if β 6= h1(νξ)

(1)

whenever β + ǫ is in the range of h1, β is divisible by ρ and ǫ < ρ. By Lemma
2.4 of [4], h2 is an embedding of the range of h1 into Rρ. Clearly, the range
of h2 is contained in [νξ ′, νξ).
1 ν, h1(νξ) ≤ρ

1 νξ. By RTSI, h1(νξ) is divisible by κα. Therefore,
2 h1(νξ). This easily implies that h2 is a ρ-covering of the range of h1.
1 νξ,

Let X be the intersection of Jξ ′ with the range of h2. Since νξ ′+1 ≤ρ

Since νξ ≤ρ

νξ ′ ≤ρ

there is a ρ-covering h3 of the range of h2 into νξ ′+1 which ﬁxes X.

Since νξ ′ is the least element of X and h3(νξ ′) = νξ ′, νξ ′ is the least element
of the range of h3. Therefore, the range of h3 is contained in [νξ ′, νξ ′+1) = Jξ ′.

20

Since ξ ′

6= 0, ξ ′ = ζ + ωη for some ζ and η. By the First Recurrence

Theorem for ≤2, there is an isomorphism h4 of J ξ ′ and J ωη.

Let h = h4 ◦ h3 ◦ h2 ◦ h1.
Since the composition of ρ-coverings is a ρ-covering, h is a ρ-covering of

Y .

A simple computation shows that h(νξ) = νωη.
Since the range of h3 is contained in Jξ ′, the range of h is contained in

Jωη.

Assume µ ∈ Y and µ ≤ρ

1 ν. We will show h(µ) ≤ρ

1 νωη+1. In the case

µ = νξ, h(µ) = νωη implying h(µ) ≤ρ

1 νωη+1. So, we may assume νξ < µ.

By choice of h1, h1(µ) ≤ρ
1 ν, νξ ≤ρ
2 ν and µ ≤ρ

1 νξ. By RTSI, h1(µ) is divisible by κα. Since
νξ ≤ρ
2 µ. Therefore, h1(νξ) ≤ρ
2 h1(µ). By part 4 of
Lemma 8.6 of [4], h1(µ) < νξ ′+1 implying h1(µ) ∈ Jξ ′. Since h1(νξ) < h1(µ),
this implies h2(h1(µ)) = h1(µ). Since h3 ﬁxes the elements of X, h3(h1(µ)) =
h1(µ). Therefore, h(µ) = h4(h1(µ)). Since h1(µ) ≤ρ
1 νξ ′+1. Since
h4 is an isomorphism of J ξ ′ and J ωη , h(µ) = h4(h1(µ)) ≤ρ
1 h4(νξ ′+1) = νωη+1.

The Second Recurrence Theorem for ≤2 below provides a computation
of the lengths of the intervals J ξ in terms of the intervals I α
β . By the First
Recurrence Theorem for ≤2, this reduces to calculating the lengths of the
intervals J ξ when ξ has the form ωη.

Theorem 4.4 (Second Recurrence Theorem for ≤2) If ωη < θ2 and
η = λ + n where n ∈ ω and λ is a multiple of ω, possibly 0, then α · λ < θα

and the following hold.

1. If ωη + 1 < θ2 then the following hold.

(a) If the largest element of I α

then the largest element of the domain of ιωη is max(I α
κα
α·(η+1).

α·λ is not a successor multiple of α

α·λ is a successor multiple of α then the

2. If ωη + 1 = θ2 and α + 1 < θ1 then the following hold.

21

(a) If the largest element of I α

the largest element of the domain of ιωη is max(I α
γ < α.

α·λ is not a successor multiple of α then
α·η+γ) for some

(b) If the largest element of I α

α·λ is a successor multiple of α then η is
a successor ordinal and the largest element of the domain of ιωη is
max(I α

α·η′+γ) for some γ < α where η = η′ + 1.

3. If ωη + 1 = θ2 and α + 1 = θ1 then η + 1 = θα
1 .

Proof. Recall that Theorem 8.8 of [4] says that either θ2 = ∞ or θ2 = θ + 1
where θ is inﬁnite and additively indecomposable.

Notice that for ξ < θ2, if Jξ is unbounded iﬀ α + 1 = θ1 and ξ + 1 = θ2.

Moreover, Jξ is unbounded iﬀ the domain of ιξ is unbounded.

We claim that if ξ + 1 < θ2 then the largest element of the domain of ιξ
is a successor multiple of α. To see this, suppose ξ + 1 < θ2. The largest
element of J ξ is νξ+1 which is a successor multiple of κα by part 11 of Lemma
8.6 of [4]. Therefore, the largest element of the domain of ιξ, ϕξ(νξ+1), is a
successor multiple of α.

When Jωη is bounded, deﬁne f (η) to be the largest β such that κα

β ∈
dom(ιωη ). By part 3 of Lemma 3.2, if ξ < θ2 and the domain of ιξ intersects
β then dom(ιξ) contains I α
I α
β . Therefore, if Jωη is bounded then the largest
f (η)). By the previous paragraph, if ωη + 1 < θ2
element of dom(ιωη ) is max(I α
then the largest element of I α
f (η) is a successor multiple of α.

We will now establish the theorem by induction on η. Let K be the class

of ordinals η such that the theorem holds.

Assume η is an ordinal such that η′ ∈ K whenever η′ < η and suppose

ωη < θ2 and η = λ + n where n ∈ ω and λ is a multiple of ω.

Case 1. Assume η = 0.
In this case, λ = n = 0 and ωη = 1.
Since I α

α·λ = I α

0 = {0} by part 1 of Lemma 5.4 of [4], and 0 is not a
successor multiple of α, the only clause which is not vacuously true is 2(a).
By parts 1 and 11 of Lemma 8.6 of [4], νm = κα · (m + 1) for m ∈ ω.
Therefore, J ωη = J 1 = [ν1, ν2] = [κα · 2, κα · 3] implying that the domain
of ιωη is [0, α]. By parts 1 and 8 of Lemma 8.6 of [4], I α
α·(η+1) = I α
α = {α}.
Therefore, the largest element of the domain of ιωη is max(Iα·(η+1)).

Case 2. Assume η is a successor ordinal.

22

Let η = η′ + 1. In this case, n > 0 and η′ = λ + (n − 1). By the induction

hypothesis, α · λ < θα
1 .

Since ωη′ + 1 < θ2, the largest element of J ωη′ is νωη′ +1 which is a suc-
cessor multiple of κα. Therefore, there exists a successor ordinal δ such
that the largest element of J ωη′ is νωη′ + κα · δ. Therefore, max(dom(ιωη′ )) =
ϕωη′ (νωη′ +1) = α·δ. Since J ωη′ is bounded, f (η′) is deﬁned and max(dom(ιωη′ )) =
max(I α

f (η′ )). Therefore, max(I α

f (η′ )) = α · δ.

Claim 1 for Case 2. Jωη′ ∼=ρ [νωη , νωη + κα · δ) and νωη + κα · δ ∈ Jωη.
By Lemma 4.1, Jωη′ is ρ-isomorphic to a proper initial segment of Jωη .
Since Jωη′ = [νωη′ , νωη′ + κα · δ), this implies that Jωη′ ∼=ρ [νωη , νωη + κα · δ)
and νωη + κα · δ ∈ Jωη.

By Lemma 6.7 of [4], there is an α-incompressible set Z whose largest

element is α · δ.

Since ϕ−1

exists Z ∗ ⊆ ϕ−1
and ιωη [Z] ⊆ Z ∗.

ωη [[0, α · δ]] = [νωη , νωη + κα · δ], part 2 of Lemma 2.2 implies there
ωη [[0, α · δ]] which is locally incompressible such that νωη ∈ Z ∗

Claim 2 for Case 2. νωη + κα · δ + κα 6∈ Jωη.
To prove the claim, argue by contradiction and assume νωη + κα · δ + κα ∈

Jωη.

Since νωη + κα · δ + κα is divisible by κα, νωη ≤ρ

2 νωη + κα · δ + κα. By
Lemma 4.3, there is a ζ < η and ρ-covering of Z ∗ into Jωζ which maps νωη
to νωζ . By Lemma 4.1, Jωζ is ρ-isomorphic to an initial segment of Jωη′ .
Therefore, we may assume ζ = η′. Since Jωη′ ∼=ρ [νωη , νωη + κα · δ), there is a
ρ-covering h of Z ∗ into [νωη , νωη + κα · δ) such that h(νωη) = νωη.

By part 2 of Lemma 3.2, there is an α-covering h′ of Z into [0, α · δ] such
ωη ◦ h ◦ ιωη )(σ) + γ whenever σ + γ ∈ Z, σ is divisible by

that h′(σ + γ) = (ι−1
α and γ < α.

Since Z in α-incompressible and α · δ is the largest element of Z, we we
will contradict part 9 of Lemma 6.4 of [4] by showing h′(α · δ) < α · δ. This
inequality follows from the deﬁnition of h′ and the fact that h(ιξ(α · δ)) ∈
h[Z ∗] < νωη + κα · δ.

To verify part 1, assume ωη + 1 < θ2.
The assumption ωη + 1 < θ2 implies Jωη = [νωη , νωη+1). Since νωη+1 is a
successor multiple of κα, Claims 1 and 2 imply that νωη +1 = νωη + κα · δ + κα.
Therefore,

max(dom(ιωη )) = ϕωη (νωη+1)

23

= ϕωη (νωη + κα · δ + κα)
= α · δ + α
= max(I α
= max(I α

f (η′ )) + α
f (η′ )+α)

To establish part 1(a), assume max(I α

α·λ) is not a successor multiple of α.
By the induction hypothesis, f (η′) = α · (η′ + 1) = α · η. By the string of
equalities above, the largest element of the domain of ιωη is max(I α
α·(η+1)) as
desired.

To establish part 1(b), assume max(I α

α·λ) is a successor multiple of α. By
the induction hypothesis, f (η′) = α · η′. By the string of equalities above,
the largest element of the domain of ιωη is max(I α

α·η) as desired.

This concludes the proof of part 1 for Case 2.

To verify part 2, assume ωη + 1 = θ2.
The assumption ωη + 1 = θ2 implies J ωη = Jωη . Using Claim 2, this
implies that α · δ + α 6∈ dom(ιωη ). On the other hand, Claim 1 implies that
α · δ ∈ dom(ιωη ). Therefore, there exists γ < α such that max(dom(ιωη )) =
α · δ + γ. Similar to the computation above, we have

max(dom(ιωη )) = α · δ + γ
= max(I α
= max(I α

f (η′ )) + γ
f (η′ )+γ)

To establish part 2(a), assume max(I α

α·λ) is not a successor multiple of α.
By the induction hypothesis, f (η′) = α · (η′ + 1) = α · η. By the string of
equalities above, the largest element of the domain of ιωη is max(I α
α·α+γ) and
γ < α as desired.

To establish part 2(b), assume max(I α

α·λ) is a successor multiple of α. By
the induction hypothesis, f (η′) = α · η′. By the string of equalities above, the
largest element of the domain of ιωη is max(I α

α·η′+γ) and γ < α as desired.

This concludes the proof of part 2 for Case 2.
Since Claim 2 implies that Jωη is bounded, the hypothesis of part 3 fails

and part 3 holds vacuously.

Case 3. Assume η is a limit ordinal.
In this case, n = 0 and λ = η.
By the induction hypothesis, part 1 of the theorem holds with η replaced
by η′ for all η′ < η. Since f (η′) is either α · η′ or α · (η′ + 1) for all η′ < η,

24

α · η is the least upper bound of the ordinals f (η′) for η′ < η and α · η < θα
1 .
Moreover, if η1 < η2 < η then f (η1) < f (η2).

By Lemma 4.2, κα

closed interval, this implies that κα
of dom(ιωη ).

f (η′) ∈ dom(ιωη ) for η′ < η. Since the domain of ιη is a
α·η is a subset

α·η ∈ dom(ιωη). Therefore, I α

First, suppose I α

α·η is unbounded. This implies that α · η + 1 = θα
1 .
By Corollary 7.3 of [4], α · η is an epsilon number greater than α implying
α · η = η and, hence, η + 1 = θα
α·η a subset of the domain of ιωη ,
Jωη is unbounded implying ωη + 1 = θ2. Therefore, the conclusion of part 3
holds. Parts 1 and 2 hold vacuously.

1 . Since I α

For the remainder of the proof, assume I α

α·η is bounded. This makes part

3 vacuously true.

Write the largest element of I α

α·η as α · δ + γ where γ < α.

Claim 1 for Case 3. νωη + κα · δ + κγ ∈ J ωη.
This follows from the fact νωη + κα · δ + κγ = ιωη (α · δ + γ).

Claim 2 for Case 3. If α · δ + γ is not a successor multiple of α then

νωη + κα · δ + κγ ∈ Jωη.

Assume α·δ+γ is not a successor multiple of α. This implies νωη +κα·δ+κγ
is not a successor multiple of κα. By Claim 1, νωη + κα · δ + κγ ∈ J ωη . In
case ωη + 1 = θ2, J ωη = Jωη and the desired conclusion follows. Suppose
ωη + 1 < θ2. Since J ωη = [νωη νωη+1] and νωη+1 is a successor multiple of κα,
νωη + κα · δ + κγ ∈ [νωη , νωη+1) = Jωη.

By Lemma 6.7 of [4], there is an α-incompressible set Z such that max(Z) =

α · δ + γ. By part 2 of Lemma 2.2, there is a locally incompressible subset
Z ∗ of [νωη , νωη + κα · δ + κγ+1) such that ιωη [Z] ⊆ Z ∗ and νωη ∈ Z ∗. By part
13 of Lemma 8.6 of [4], [νωη , νωη + κα · δ + κγ+1) ⊆ J ωη . Therefore, Z ∗ is a
subset of J ωη .

Claim 3 for Case 3. νωη + κα · δ + κα 6∈ Jωη.
The proof is similar to that of Claim 2 for Case 2.
Argue by contradiction and assume νωη + κα · δ + κα ∈ Jωη.
Since νωη + κα · δ + κα is divisible by κα, νωη ≤ρ

2 νωη + κα · δ + κα.
By Lemma 4.3, there is a η′ < η and ρ-covering h1 of Z ∗ into Jωη′ which
maps νωη to νωη′ . Since νωη′ +1 is a multiple of κα, there exists δ′ such that
νωη′ +1 = νωη + κα · δ′. Since max(J ωη′ ) = νωη′ +1, this implies max(I α
f (η′ )) =
max(dom(ιωη′ )) = ϕωη′ (νωη + κα · δ′) = α · δ′. Since f (η′) < α · η, this implies
α · δ′ < α · δ + γ.

25

By Lemma 4.1, Jωη′ is ρ-isomorphic to a proper initial segment of Jωη .
Let h2 be the ρ-isomorphism of Jωη′ and [νωη , νωη + κα · δ′). Let h = h2 ◦ h1.
h is a ρ-covering of Z ∗ into [νωη , νωη + κα · δ′) and h(νωη ) = νωη . By part
2 of Lemma 3.2, there is an α-covering h′ of Z into [0, α · δ + γ] such that
h′(σ + ζ) = (ι−1
ωη ◦ h ◦ ιωη )(σ) + ζ whenever σ + ζ ∈ Z, σ is divisible by α and
ζ < α.

We claim h′ maps Z into [0, α·δ′) which contradicts fact Z is α-incompressible.

To see this, it suﬃces to show h′(α·δ +γ) < α·δ′. Since h(ιξ(α·δ)) ∈ h[Z∗] <
νωωη + κα · δ′, the deﬁnition of h′ implies h′(α · δ) < α · δ′. Since α is additively
indecomposable, h′(α · δ + γ) = h′(α · δ) + γ < α · δ′.

Claim 4 for Case 3.

If α · δ + γ is a successor multiple of α then

νωη + κα · δ 6∈ Jωη.

Argue by contradiction and assume α · δ + γ is a successor multiple of
α but νωη + κα · δ ∈ Jωη. This implies δ is a successor ordinal and γ = 0.
Therefore, Z ∗ ⊆ [νωη , νωη + κα · δ + κ1) = [νωη , νωη + κα · δ].

Since νωη + κα · δ is divisible by κα, νωη ≤ρ

2 νωη + κα · δ. Let Z − be
Z ∗ − {νωη + κα · δ}. Since Z ∗ ⊆ [νωη , νωη + κα · δ], Z − ⊆ [νωη , νωη + κα · δ).
By Lemma 4.3, there is a η′ < η and ρ-covering h1 of Z − into Jωη′ such that
h1(νωη ) = νωη′ and h1(µ) ≤ρ
1 νωη + κα · δ .
Since νωη′ +1 is a multiple of κα, there exists δ′ such that νωη′ +1 = νωη + κα · δ′.
Since max(J ωη′ ) = νωη′ +1, this implies max(I α
f (η′ )) = max(dom(ιωη′ )) =
ϕωη′ (νωη + κα · δ′) = α · δ′. Since f (η′) < α · η, this implies α · δ′ < α · δ.

1 νωη′ +1 whenever µ ∈ Z − and µ ≤ρ

By Lemma 4.1, Jωη′ is ρ-isomorphic to a proper initial segment of Jωη .
Let h2 be the ρ-isomorphism of Jωη′ and [νωη , νωη + κα · δ′). Deﬁne h on Z ∗
by

h(β) =(h2(h1(β))

νωη + κα · δ′

if β 6= νωη + κα · δ
if β = νωη + κα · δ

(2)

Notice that the range of h is contained in [νωη , νωη + κα · δ′].

We claim that h is a ρ-covering of Z ∗. By Lemma 2.4 of [4], h is an

embedding of Z ∗ into Rρ.

Clearly, the restriction of h to Z − is a ρ-covering of Z −.
Since δ is a successor ordinal, νωη + κα · δ is not a limit of ordinals which
2 µ implies µ is divisible by κα, νωη + κα · δ is
2 µ. By part 2 of Lemma 3.6 of [4], there
2 νωη + κα · δ.

are divisible by κα. Since νωη ≤ρ
not a limit of ordinals µ with νωη ≤ρ
is no µ such that νωη < µ and µ <ρ

26

Since νωη + κα · δ′ < νωη + κα · δ ∈ J ωη, νωη + κα · δ′ ∈ Jωη and νωη ≤ρ
2
νωη + κα · δ′. This fact and the conclusions of the previous two paragraphs
easily imply h is a ρ-covering of Z ∗.

By part 2 of Lemma 3.2, there is an α-covering h′ of Z into [0, α · δ] such
ωη ◦ h ◦ ιωη )(σ) + ζ whenever σ + ζ ∈ Z, σ is divisible by

that h′(σ + ζ) = (ι−1
α and ζ < α.

Clearly, h′(α · δ) = α · δ′. Since α · δ = max(Z) and δ′ < δ, this contradicts

the fact that Z is α-incompressible.

To verify part 1, assume ωη +1 < θ2. This implies that Jωη = [νωη , νωη+1).
To establish part 1(a), assume α · δ + γ is not a successor multiple of α.
We will show that max(dom(ιωη )) = max(I α
α·(η+1)). Since νωη+1 is a successor
multiple of κα, Claims 2 and 3 imply that νωη +1 = νωη +κα ·δ +κα. Therefore,

max(dom(ιωη )) = ϕωη (νωη+1)

= ϕωη (νωη + κα · δ + κα)
= α · δ + α
= α · δ + γ + α
= max(I α

α·η+α)

To establish part 1(b), assume α · δ + γ is a successor multiple of α. We
will show that max(dom(ιωη )) = max(I α
α·η). In this case γ = 0. Since νωη+1
is a successor multiple of κα, Claims 1 and 4 imply that νωη+1 = νωη + κα · δ.
Therefore,

max(dom(ιωη )) = ϕωη (νωη+1)

= ϕωη (νωη + κα · δ)
= α · δ
= α · δ
= max(I α

α·η)

This concludes the proof of part 1 for Case 2.

To verify part 2, assume ωη + 1 = θ2.
The assumption ωη + 1 = θ2 implies J ωη = Jωη. By Claims 1 and 4,

α · δ + γ is not a successor multiple of α making part 2(b) vacuously true.

By Claim 3 and the fact J ωη = Jωη , α · δ + α 6∈ dom(ιωη). Since α · δ +
γ ∈ dom(ιωη), this implies there exists γ ′ < α such that max(dom(ιωη )) =
α · δ + γ + γ ′. To establish part 2(a), we will show that max(dom(ιωη )) =
max(I α

α·δ+γ ′).
