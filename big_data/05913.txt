Hard State

ABSTRACT

Utilizing an archived Suzaku data acquired on 2007 December 25 for 46 ks, X-
ray spectroscopic properties of the dipping and eclipsing low-mass X-ray binary EXO
0748−676 were studied. At an assumed distance of 7.1 kpc, the data gave a persistent
unabsorbed luminosity of 3.4 × 1036 erg cm−2 s−1 in 0.6 − 55 keV. The source was in a
relatively bright low/hard state, wherein the 0.6 − 55 keV spectrum can be successfully
explained by a “double-seed” Comptonization model, incorporating a common corona
with an electron temperature of ∼ 13 keV. The seed photons are thought to be supplied
from both the neutron star surface, and a cooler truncated disk. Compared to a sample
of non-dipping low-mass X-ray binaries in the low/hard state, the spectrum is subject
to stronger Comptonization, with a relatively larger Comptonizing y-parameter of ∼
1.4 and a larger coronal optical depth of ∼ 5. This result, when attributed to the high
inclination of EXO 0748−676, suggests that the Comptonizing corona may elongate
along the disk plane, and give a longer path for the seed photons when viewed from
edge-on inclinations.

Introduction

Neutron-star low-mass X-ray binaries (hereafter LMXBs), luminous X-ray objects in the
Milky Way and other galaxies, are low-magnetic-ﬁeld neutron stars (NSs) accreting materials from
their low-mass companions through Roche lobe overﬂow. They are found either in the high/soft
state (HSS) or the low/hard state (LHS) (e.g., White & Mason 1985; Mitsuda et al. 1984, 1989).
For “atoll” sources including the LMXBs studied in the present paper, these physical states corre-
spond respectively to the “banana” and “island” states (Hasinger & van der Klis 1989), which are
based on empirical color-color diagrams. In the LHS, an LMXB exhibits a rather hard spectrum
extending to ∼ 100 keV, which is considered to arise from thermal Comptonization, wherein some
soft photons are boosted to higher energies by hot electrons (Sunyaev & Titarchuk 1980) in a vicin-
ity of the NS. The cloud of hot electrons is often referred to as “Comptonizing corona” (hereafter
CC; Chapline & Stevens 1973; Lamb & Sanford 1979).

Generally, the CC is identiﬁed as a geometrically thick and optically thin accretion ﬂow,
which is considered to form near an accreting compact object when the mass accretion rate is
relatively low (Lightman & Eardley 1974). Recent Suzaku observations (e.g., Sakurai et al. 2012,
2014) are conﬁrming that the CC in several LMXBs is accreting relatively isotropically onto the
NS, at least when the luminosity is ∼ 1% of the Eddington luminosity (Ledd; Matsuoka & Asai
2013; Sakurai et al. 2014). However, the more detailed geometry of the inﬂowing corona is still
unclear. In particular, it is still unknown whether it is very spherical, or oblate towards the disk
plane. Thus we are motivated to compare “dipping” and “non-dipping” LMXBs in the LHS, in
order to further study the coronal shape.

Dipping LMXBs, or “dippers”, are characterized by periodic dips in their X-ray intensity, and
are considered to be intrinsically the same as non-dipping LMXBs, except for their more edge-on
inclination angles. If CC has an oblate shape, dipping LMXBs would show systematically stronger
Comptonization in the non-dipping period, because the seed photons must pass through the CC
with a longer path. Indeed, dippers have been reported to exhibit rather hard X-ray spectra over a
large range of luminosity. Examples include BeppoSAX observations of 4U 1915−05 (Church et al.
1998), XB 1254−690 (Iaria et al. 2001), XB 1323−619 (Bałuci´nska-Church et al. 1999) and EXO
0748−676 (Sidoli et al. 2005).

In these previous studies of dipping LMXBs, the X-ray spectra were in most cases ﬁtted
with an empirical cutoﬀ power-law model. However, this is not physical, and does not enable
detailed comparison between dippers and other LMXBs. Given this, Zhang et al. (2014) studied
a Suzaku data set of 4U 1915−05 in the HSS. They successfully reproduced the 0.8 − 45 keV
spectrum of this source, using the canonical two component spectral model (Mitsuda et al. 1984)
that describes broadband X-ray spectra of non-dipping LMXBs in the HSS. Furthermore, they
found that the blackbody component of this dipper is more strongly Comptonized than in nor-

– 3 –

mal LMXBs. This gives evidence that the CC in the HSS is rather ﬂattened to the accretion disk
plane, in agreement with the report by Gladstone et al. (2007), that dipping LMXBs in the HSS
have systematically harder spectra than normal LMXBs. In the LHS, however, evidence of ﬂat-
tened coronae has so far been obtained only in black hole binaries (BHBs, e.g., Makishima 2007;
Heil et al. 2015). So, in the present paper, we intend to carry out similar studies for LMXBs in the
LHS.

For the above purpose, we again choose the Japanese satellite Suzaku (Mitsuda et al. 2007),
which possesses both a high energy resolution and a broadband coverage. Among the four LHS
dipping LMXBs (EXO 0748−676, XB 1323−619, XTE J1710−281 and 4U 1822−37) in suzaku
archive, we selected EXO 0748−676, which has the highest X-ray ﬂux as indicated in Table 1 of
Zhang et al. (2014). From an EXOSAT observation, Parmar et al. (1986) ﬁrst discovered that EXO
0748−676 shows irregular intensity dips and a total eclipse, synchronized with its orbital period of
3.82 hr, and constrained the source inclination angle to be i = 75◦ − 83◦. We hence ﬁx i = 80◦ in
the present paper. Since then, the object has been studied by many authors, including Cottam et al.
(2001), Jimenez-Garate et al. (2003), Sidoli et al. (2005) and D´ıaz Trigo et al. (2011). However,
except for Sidoli et al. (2005), most of these publications focused on the dip phenomenon or X-ray
bursts, without much attention to the intrinsic persistent emission. In the present work, we utilize
the Suzaku observation of this source, in order to obtain physical constrains on the source accretion
scheme (section 5.1), including the shape of the CC (from section 5.2).

In the present paper, we employ a source distance of d = 7.1 ± 1.2 kpc, which is based
on the detailed analysis of helium-dominated X-ray bursts with photospheric radius expansion
(Galloway et al. 2008). This value is consistent with an upper limit from analysis of persistent
spectra by D´ıaz Trigo et al. (2011), but is larger than is indicated by the X-ray burst analysis assum-
ing hydrogen-dominated atmosphere (d ∼ 5 kpc, Wolﬀ et al. 2005; Galloway et al. 2008). Thus,
we include a distance uncertainty of 30%.

2. Observation

EXO 0748−676 was observed by Suzaku on 2007 December 25 (MJD 54459) with ObsID
of 402092010. The observation started at 05:41:13, and ended at 07:00:24 the next day with an
elapsed time of 91.0 ks and a net exposure time of 45.9 ks. The soft X-ray band (0.2 − 12 keV)
was covered by three cameras of the X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (XIS 0, XIS 1 and XIS 3) on
board, while XIS 2 had stopped working before this observation. We utilized only XIS 0 and XIS 3
to extract light curves (section 2.2) and spectrum (section 3), because these front-illuminated CCD
cameras are more accurately calibrated than XIS 1 which uses a back-illuminated CCD chip. In
the hard X-ray band above 10 keV, we analyzed HXD-PIN data which have an energy coverage up

– 4 –

to 70 keV. The data from HXD-GSO were not employed because the source was not signiﬁcantly
detected therein. Both the XIS and HXD-PIN data were analyzed by HEAsoft version 6.13, with
the calibration database of version 20070731 for the XIS, and version 20070710 for the HXD.

2.1. XIS and HXD-PIN Data Analysis

In the present observation, XIS 0 and XIS 3 were both operated in the normal mode using
1/4 window option. For each CCD camera, events with pixel formats of 3 × 3 and 5 × 5 were
combined, and the events with grades 0,2,3,4 and 6 were selected. The total count rate was ∼ 11.0
cts s−1 per XIS camera. With a time resolution of 2 s, photon pileup is negligible (Yamada et al.
2012). Thus, around the X-ray center at α = 07h48m31.19s and δ = -67◦45′09.52′′ (J2000.0), we
accumulated on-source events over a circle of 2′, which contains 90% of the source counts. The
background regions were chosen to be two circles from two edges of the CCD, each located 7′
from the source center, with a radius of 1′.4; the total background area equals to the source area.
The background-subtracted source count rate in the 0.6 − 10 keV range is 9.33± 0.01 cts s−1, when
averaged between XIS 0 and XIS 3.

The source was detected up to 55 keV with HXD-PIN. The raw 12 − 55 keV count rate was
1.06 ± 0.01 cts s−1 on average, among which 0.54 cts s−1 was Non X-ray Background (NXB)
according to the NXB model provided by the HXD team. Contribution from the Cosmic X-ray
Background (CXB) was calculated to be 0.02 cts s−1 using a model as

CXB(E) = 9.41 × 10−3 (cid:18) E

1 keV(cid:19)−1.29

exp(cid:18)−

E

40 keV(cid:19)

(1)

(Boldt 1987), where the unit is photons cm−2 s−1 keV−1 FOV−1. After subtracting both NXB and
CXB, and further correcting the data for the dead time with a command hxddtcor, the 12 − 55
keV PIN signal count rate became 0.58 ± 0.01 cts s−1.

2.2. Light Curves

Figure 1 (left panels) shows background-subtracted (using lcmath) light curves of the XIS
and HXD-PIN, and the ratio of the latter to the former. From the HXD-PIN data we subtracted
only the NXB, since the CXB is constant and rather minor. Multiple dips are seen in the light
curves, especially in that of the XIS, as repeatedly reported and explained to be caused by an
ionized absorber on the accretion disk (D´ıaz Trigo et al. 2006). Four type I X-ray bursts were also
detected at observation times of 30.0 ks, 47.0 ks, 64.6 ks and 85.7 ks. Detailed analysis of the

– 5 –

dips and bursts are out of the scope of this paper. Except for the dips and bursts, both the XIS and
HXD-PIN count rates, and hence the hardness ratio, remained constant within ∼10%.

After excluding the bursts, we folded the XIS and HXD-PIN light curves and the hardness
ratio at the orbital period of Porb = 13766.8 s measured by Parmar et al. (1986). Phase 0 (=1)
was set to be the middle of the eclipse, which refers to 06:12:03 of 2007 December 25 (MJD =
54459.26018). The results are shown in the right panels of ﬁgure 1. The dips (except for the
eclipses) are noticed only in the XIS light curve over an orbital phase φ ∼ 0.6 − 1.1, while the rest
can be considered as non-dip phases.

3. Analysis of Non-Dip Spectra

3.1. Preparation of Spectra

Since the XIS and HXD-PIN light curves are both approximately constant (ﬁgure 1), we
utilized the whole observation period for the non-dip spectral analysis, but excluding the orbital
phases of φ = 0.6 − 1.1 in reference to ﬁgure 1. The type I X-ray bursts (with the 0.6-10 keV
XIS count rate > 12 cts s−1) were also removed. By further requiring the simultaneous presence
of the XIS and HXD-PIN data, the remaining exposure became 16.2 ks, which is ∼ 35% of the
total exposure. Spectra from XIS 0 and XIS 3 were co-added; so were their responses. To analyze
the HXD-PIN data, we utilized the “XIS nominal” response ﬁle released from the HXD team, and
the CXB contribution was included in a model as a ﬁxed component of equation (1). We chose an
energy range of 0.6 − 10 keV for the XIS, and 12 − 55 keV for the HXD-PIN data. To avoid the
calibration uncertainties around the instrumental silicon K-edge and the gold M-edge, we excluded
1.7 − 1.9 keV and 2.2 − 2.4 keV energy ranges of the XIS spectrum, respectively. The instrumental
Al K-edge, which is not fully accounted for by the response, was ﬁtted by an edge model, with the
edge energy ﬁxed at 1.56 keV. The cross normalization of HXD-PIN relative to the XIS was ﬁxed
at 1.158 (Kokubun et al. 2007).

Figure 2(a) shows the derived count spectrum, and ﬁgure 2(b) shows its νFν form. Thus,
the spectrum extends up to ∼ 20 keV with a hard slope, and then turns over gradually. It can be
approximated (with χ2/ν = 295.6/142) by the model highecut∗powerlaw, deﬁned as

A(E) = 

with a photon index Γ ∼ 1.7, a cutoﬀ energy Ec ∼ 22 keV, and an e-folding energy Ef ∼ 60 keV,
while K is the normalization. The low Γ value indicates that the source was in the LHS with strong

– 6 –

Comptonization, while the value of Ec suggests a relatively low coronal electron temperature. The
data-to-model ratio in panel (c) reveals a soft excess below ∼ 1 keV, which suggests that the overall
emission may contain more than a single component.

3.2. Single-Seed Comptonization Models

Although the empirical model in ﬁgure 2 is roughly successful, it is not yet fully accept-
able, and it has little physical meaning. Hence, we attempt to ﬁt the spectrum with the canonical
two-component spectral model for LMXBs, diskbb+bbody (Mitsuda et al. 1984), applying the
Comptonization code nthcomp (Zdziarski et al. 1996; ˙Zycki et al. 1999) on either (single-seed)
or both (double-seed) of the two optically-thick components. In Sakurai et al. (2012), the model
diskbb+nthcomp[bbody], in which the seed photons are from the NS surface as indicated by the
square bracket, successfully explained the LHS spectra of Aql X−1 obtained with Suzaku. Thus,
we ﬁrst applied the same model to the spectra of EXO 0748−676. Column density of photoelectric
absorption was ﬁxed to the Galactic line-of-sight value of NH = 1.1×1021 cm−2, because the source
locates ∼ 2.4 kpc below the Galactic plane, as calculated from its Galactic latitude b = −19.8◦,
and the source distance of 7.1 kpc; hence, the source is outside the neutral hydrogen disk of the
Galaxy.

The obtained results are shown in ﬁgure 3(a). Around 0.8 − 1.2 keV, we noticed some negative
residual features that cannot be explained by the Galactic absorption, with the ﬁt goodness of χ2(ν)
= 175.0 (142). Thus we added a partial ionized absorber with the code zxipcf in XSPEC, using a
grid of XSTAR photoionized absorption models (Reeves et al. 2008). The absorber column density
Nabs, the ionization parameter log(ξ), and the absorber covering fraction were set to be free, while
the redshift was ﬁxed to 0. The ﬁt gave Nabs < 1.1 × 1022 cm−2 and log(ξ) ∼ 2.4, together with
χ2(ν) = 166.5 (139). However, as shown in ﬁgure 3(b), an absorption feature was still evident at ∼
1 keV, which may be related to Neon Lyα1. We hence added a Gaussian absorption model, with
the 1σ line width ﬁxed at 20 eV.

Through the above improvements, the ﬁt has become fully acceptable with χ2(ν) = 142.8(137),
as shown in table 1 labeled as “single-seed” model, and in ﬁgure 3(c). The obtained inner-disk tem-
perature kTin ∼ 0.2 keV and the radius Rin ∼ 160 km indicate a disk truncated at a large radius. For
the NS blackbody, which serves as the seed component of the nthcomp model, the data gave only
an upper limit of kTbb ∼ 0.25 keV, and a lower limit of Rbb ∼ 33 km as speciﬁed by the nthcomp
normalization. However, this value of Rbb is much larger than the neutron star radius, even consid-
ering the 30% distance uncertainty. This means that the data requires more seed photons than are
available from the NS surface, encouraging us to consider a “double-seed” modeling in the next
subsection.

– 7 –

In addition to the above attempts, we also considered two more single-seed Comptonization
models. One is bbody+nthcomp[diskbb], assuming that the seed photons are supplied only from
the disk. This is equivalent to some disk Comptonization models (e.g., Church & Balucinska-Church
1995). The other is a partial NS Comptonization model, bbody+nthcomp[bbody], in which some
fraction of the NS blackbody is Comptonized while the rest is directly visible, and the disk emis-
sion is not detected. Both models gave acceptable ﬁts to the data; however, neither of them was
physically acceptable. The disk Comptonization model gave too large a blackbody radius as Rbb >
100 km, trying to explain the soft excess with a rather low temperature, and too large a disk radius
as Rin > 1000 km to supply a suﬃcient number of seed photons. In the partial NS Comptonization
model, the directly seen bbody component and the Comptonized seed bbody both became too
large in radius as Rbb > 100 km, for a similar reason as above. Thus, we no longer consider these
two models hereafter.

−0.2 keV with a reasonable blackbody radius of 2.9+8.0

We further examined the spectrum for the possible presence of other additional components,
especially a directly seen NS blackbody emission (e.g., Lyu et al. 2014), and disk reﬂection (e.g.,
Di Salvo et al. 2015). By adding another bbody component to our ﬁnal single-seed solution (ﬁgure
3c), the ﬁt was improved by ∆χ2 = −7.46 for ∆ν = -2. The derived blackbody temperature is
0.4+0.1
−0.9 km. However, the Comptonized bbody
component did not change signiﬁcantly, so that the total blackbody radius further increased and
hence the ﬁt became even more unphysical. For the disk reﬂection, we multiplied a reflect
component on our model and derived a scaling factor (the solid angle divided by 2π) of ∼ 0.16.
However, the ﬁt was improved only by ∆χ2 = −0.9 for ∆ν = -1; thus we do not consider that a
reﬂection component is very necessary in this high inclination system.

3.3. Double-Seed Comptonization Models

In order to overcome the seed-photon shortage revealed in section 3.2, we next consider a
“double-seed” Comptonization, namely, the case wherein the disk emission and the NS black-
body are both Comptonized to jointly produce the hard continuum. The model thus becomes
nthcomp[diskbb]+nthcomp[bbody] with the common Galactic absorption. The values of kTe and
Γ were ﬁrst constrained to be the same between the two Comptonization components, but the ﬁt
was far from acceptable since the model could not explain the slightly concave spectral shape. As
indicated by recent results on LMXBs in the LHS (e.g., Sakurai et al. 2014), the disk is likely to
be truncated at a large distance from the central NS, and hence it is reasonable to assume diﬀerent
optical depths for the two Comptonization components. Hence, we allowed them to have diﬀerent
values of Γ, while kTe was kept the same. This model was found to be successful with χ2(ν) =
134.6 (136). Compared to the single-seed model, it is better by ∆χ2 = −6.5, for a decrease of only

– 8 –

by ∆ν = −1.

The successful ﬁt obtained above is shown in table 1 as “double-seed” model, and in ﬁgure
3(d). Thus, the Comptonized disk emission takes a larger fraction of the soft-band emission below
2 keV, compared to the solution of the single-seed model. As a result, the NS component moved to
higher energies with a higher kTbb and a considerably smaller Rbb which is physically acceptable
within errors. This solves the problem encountered in the single-seed modeling. The value of
Rin has become even larger than that obtained in the single-seed modeling, but its lower limit is
still reasonable at ∼ 150 km, calculated using the lower limit on the distance (5 kpc, Galloway et al.
2008) and the upper limit on the inclination (75◦, Parmar et al. 1986). The coronal temperature has
remained relatively unchanged from the single-seed model. The slope Γ for the disk has been found
to be much larger (steeper) than that for the NS, resulting in a ∼ 5 times smaller coronal optical
depth (table 1). This is reasonable considering the large value of Rin. We further allowed the two
Comptonized components to have diﬀerent values of kTe. Then, the disk component favored a
lower value of kTe, but the ﬁt goodness did not change signiﬁcantly.

Based on this modeling, the unabsorbed source ﬂux in 0.6 − 55 keV was calculated to be
5.7 × 10−10 erg cm−2 s−1, which gives an unabsorbed luminosity of 3.4 × 1036 erg cm−2 s−1 in 0.6
− 55 keV and 5.2 × 1036 erg cm−2 s−1 after bolometric correction. The latter corresponds to ∼
0.025 Ledd assuming a hydrogen-dominated donor star. The luminosity could be twice higher if we
considered the inclination eﬀect, or lower by a factor of 2 if taking into account the 30% distance
uncertainty.

4.

Suzaku Archived Sample of Non-dipping LMXBs

So far, we have successfully explained the Suzaku spectra of EXO 0748−676 using a spectral
model that was developed to explain those of non-dipping LMXBs in the LHS. The next task is to
examine whether the derived model parameters, in particular τ and kTe, diﬀer between the present
dipping source and other non-dipping ones. For this purpose, we performed, after Sakurai (2015),
a survey of “normal” LMXB spectra in the Suzaku archive. In addition to dippers, we also excluded
high magnetic ﬁeld sources (e.g., Her X−1, GX 1+4, 4U 1626−67, and 4U 1822−37; Sasano et al.
2014), ultra compact X-ray binaries (with hydrogen-depleted donor stars), and symbiotic binaries
(with evolved companions), because the accreting matters in the latter two types of systems are
considered to have non-solar electron-to-baryon number ratios, which may aﬀect the Comptoniza-
tion details. As listed in Table 2, this selection left us with 43 observations of 16 normal LMXBs.
As shown by Sakurai (2015), the hardness ratio H between the 20 − 40 keV HXD-PIN signal rates
to the 5 − 10 keV XIS-FI signal rates (both with the background subtracted) serves as a good state
indicator. Thus, 16 observations of 8 sources were found to sample the LHS, with H > 0.03;

– 9 –

these are listed in Table 3. Among them, the six observations of Aql X−1 (ObsID from 402053020
to 402053070) were previously analyzed by Sakurai et al. (2014) and were updated by Sakurai
(2015). Besides, GS 1826−238 was further studied in detail by Ono et al. (2016), of which the
results are quoted in the present paper.

We analyzed the data of the remaining 15 observations employed similar procedures as de-
scribed in section 2.1. A major diﬀerence is that the XIS background events were taken from an
annulus with the inner radius of 4′ and the outer radius of 5′. Moreover, the emission from Aql
X−1 was detected with HXD-GSO up to > 100 keV.

We then ﬁt the spectra of the XIS and the HXD jointly, using either the single-seed or the
double-seed models employed in the previous section. As for the Comptonization code, either
nthcomp or compPS (Poutanen & Svensson 1996) was adopted when the optical depth is τ & 2
or τ . 2, respectively. The latter model was employed under spherical geometry, namely the
geometry parameter of 4 in XSPEC. In an overlapping parameter region at τ ∼ 2, the two codes
yielded very similar kTe and τ within ∼ 3% (Sakurai 2015). Since these LHS sources span a large
range (∼ 5 orders of magnitude) of luminosities (or mass accretion rates), their spectra exhibited
some variety. For example, the disk emission was undetectable from the two faintest sources, Cen
X−4 and SLX 1737−282, and the three faintest observations of Aql X−1. Twelve out of the 15
spectra were explained by the single-seed modeling (section 3.2), while the remaining three (two
from 4U 1705−44, and one from Aql X−1) required the double-seed modeling. However, unlike
EXO 0748−676, these data sets preferred a common corona with the same kTe and τ for the two-
seed sources. The disk reﬂection was found to be necessary only for three observations of Aql
X-1 (ObsID from 402053020 to 402053040), as already published in Sakurai et al. (2012). The ﬁt
results to the 15 spectra are summarized in Table 3. We discuss these results in section 5.

5. Discussion and Conclusion

5.1. The Spectral Modeling of EXO 0748−676

During the present Suzaku observation, EXO 0748−676 was in the LHS because it exhibited
a very hard spectral slope of Γ ∼ 1.7 up to ∼ 20 keV (ﬁgure 2). This classiﬁcation is also supported
by its high value of the hardness ratio (section 4), H = 0.077 ± 0.002. Its persistent luminosity,
Lbol ∼ 0.025+0.025
−0.013 Ledd, is relatively high among LMXBs in the LHS, considering that the soft-
to-hard state transition luminosity for LMXBs is generally 0.01 − 0.04 Ledd (Maccarone 2003;
Matsuoka & Asai 2013). Such a luminous hard-state LMXB is however not rare, as the luminosity
range of the Suzaku LHS sample spans from . 0.01 to ∼ 0.1 Ledd (Table 3).

The broadband Suzaku spectrum of this object has been described successfully with the canon-

ical two-component model for LMXBs (Mitsuda et al. 1984), namely, the NS and disk emissions,
plus Comptonization. The data indicate a “double-seed” Comptonization condition (sections 3.2
and 3.3), where the NS blackbody emission and the disk emission are both Comptonized, to form
the hard continuum and to acquire a higher color temperature, respectively. Assuming a common
electron temperature, the obtained value of kTe ∼ 13 keV is relatively low for LMXBs in the LHS,
as judged from the compilation in Table 3, where most of the other sources show kTe > 20 keV. The
optical depths of the two components were calculated using equation (2) of Zhang et al. (2014),
so were the Comptonizing y-parameters deﬁned therein. As clearly seen in ﬁgure 3(d), the disk
component is less Comptonized than the NS component, because the corresponding disk/NS ratio
of τ is ∼ 1/5, and the ratio of y-parameters is ∼ 1/10. Considering the large value of Rin, it suggests
that the corona is centrally localized, and the disk intrudes into only the outer part of the corona.
Similar results were obtained by Ono et al. (2016) on GS 1826−238, that only an inner region of a
truncated accretion disk is Comptonized.

We further compared the above results with the compilation of the Suzaku sample shown in
Table 3. There, the ﬁt results to the 16 LHS spectra of the 8 LMXBs can be classiﬁed into three
categories, based on their best-ﬁt models; while these categories all involve Comptonized NS emis-
sion, their diﬀerence is in the disk emission. The ﬁve observations in category 1 (C1) did not have
disk emission detected in the Suzaku spectra, and their luminosities are all < 0.01Ledd. In seven
observations with LX & 0.01Ledd, forming category 2 (C2), the disk was detected but it did not
need to be Comptonized. Finally, in the four most luminous observations with LX ∼ 0.1Ledd, to
be called category 3 (C3), the disk emission was also strongly Comptonized by a corona that can
be considered either to be the same (with the same kTe and τ values) as for the NS Comptoniza-
tion (406010010 of Aql X−1 and 4U 1705−44), or to have a lower temperature (GS 1826−238;
Ono et al. 2016). The luminosity of EXO 0748−676 is higher than in most of the LMXBs in C2,
and lower than (ignoring the inclination eﬀect) in all LMXBs in C3. The accretion scheme of this
source is likely in between those of LMXBs with single-seed and double-seed Comptonization,
because the ﬁt prefers disk Comptonization, but to a less extent than that of the NS.

Further comparing the results on EXO 0748−676 (Table 1) with those of the other LMXBs
(Table 3), two possible diﬀerences are noticed; the considerably larger value of Rin, and the some-
what lower kTbb (. 0.4 keV vs. & 0.5 keV). However, we consider these to be still within systematic
uncertainties of the spectral modeling, for the following reasons. First, the disk emission of EXO
0748−676 is very much weakened by the high inclination, and couples strongly with the neutral
and ionized absorptions at the softest end of the spectrum. As a result, the diskbb and its Comp-
tonization must be subject to considerable systematic uncertainties. Second, in ﬁgure 3(d), the
value of kTbb is constrained only by the 1−2 keV data points, where the Rayleigh-Jeans regime
of the underlying blackbody is directly visible. Since this is the very energy range where the
disk emission and the Comptonized blackbody overlap, the systematic uncertainties will propagate

– 11 –

from the former to the latter. To test the above inferences, we re-ﬁtted the EXO 0748−676 spectra
with the same model as in ﬁgure 3(d), but ﬁxing kTbb at 0.5 keV. Then, the ﬁt goodness decreased
only slightly, by ∆χ2 = 16.2 for ∆ν = +1. Therefore, we do not consider that the model parameters
of EXO 0748−676 are deviated from those of the other objects.

5.2. Properties of the Comptonizing Corona

Now we discuss the Comptonizing eﬀects of EXO 0748−676. Judging directly from the
spectral shape, EXO 0748−676 exhibited a hard spectral slope of Γ = 1.7 in 5 − 20 keV, an energy
band dominated by the Comptonized NS emission and is free from interstellar absorption. It could
be even harder as once revealed by BeppoS AX in 2000, wherein the spectrum extended to ∼ 100
keV with Γ ∼ 1.3 (Sidoli et al. 2005). Other non-dipping LHS LMXBs, in contrast, show a rather
ﬂat slope in νFν plot of Γ ∼ 2 in the same energy range. Examples in the literatures include the
persistent LMXBs in the LHS, GS 1826−238 (ﬁgure 2 of Ono et al. 2016), 4U 1728−34 (ﬁgure 6 of
Tarana et al. 2011), 4U 1705−44 (top panel in ﬁgure 3 of Lin et al. 2010) and 4U 1812−12 (ﬁgure
2 of Tarana et al. 2006), and the transient LMXBs in the LHS, Aql X−1 (ﬁgure 2 of Sakurai et al.
2014) and 4U 1608−522 (top left panel in ﬁgure 5 of Tarana et al. 2008). The harder spectral slope
indicates that EXO 0748−676 has stronger Comptonization of the NS component than the others.
Let us more quantitatively compare EXO 0748−676 with the Suzaku sample. For this pur-
pose, ﬁgure 4(a) shows the calculated Compton y-parameter of the present sources, including EXO
0748−676, against their bolometric luminosity LX. From the low luminosity end, the y-parameter
remains approximately constant at ∼ 0.5 within errors till 2 − 4 × 1036 erg s−1, and then increases
towards higher luminosities. The point of EXO 0748−676, plotted in diamond, is an obvious out-
lier with a ∼ 1.5 − 3 times higher y value than sources with similar LX. This conﬁrms that the NS
emission is more strongly Comptonized in EXO 0748−676 than in the other sources. Furthermore,
this eﬀect must be attributed to a larger τ of EXO 0748−676, because it has a rather low kTe.
Indeed, this expectation is directly conﬁrmed in an LX-τ plot presented in ﬁgure 4(b), where EXO
0748−676 again stands out.

Although the luminosity is the primary quantity to control the behavior of LMXBs, it is
subject to distance (and some extent inclination) uncertainties. Moreover, a hysteresis eﬀect
(Meyer-Hofmeister et al. 2005; Miyamoto et al. 1995) may complicate the behavior of sources
near the transition luminosities, including EXO 0748−676. Hence, we introduce a new parameter
Q ≡ kTe/kTbb proposed by Makishima (2014), which represents a balance between the electron
heating from ions, and their cooling through Comptonization by the seed photons. This quantity
is independent of the source distance, and has been conﬁrmed to be free from the hysteresis. It
hence serves as a good state indicator, which separates the HSS (Q . 7) from the LHS (Q & 10)

– 12 –

(Makishima 2014; Sakurai 2015). We show Q-y and Q-τ diagrams in ﬁgure 4(c) and ﬁgure 4(d),
respectively. Thus, the systematically larger y and τ of EXO 0748−676 are still apparent, even
when LX is replaced by Q.

Because EXO 0748−676 has a very high inclination compared to the other LMXBs consid-
ered here, its large τ can be most naturally ascribed to a ﬂattened coronal shape, which will give a
longer path length when viewed from high inclinations. As indicated by ﬁgure 4(b) and 4(d), the
τ value of EXO 0748−676 is about twice of the average value of the other LMXBs with the same
LX and Q. Assuming that the corona has an axi-symmetric ellipsoidal geometry, that the electron
density does not depend signiﬁcantly on the sources, and that the inclination is i = 80◦ in EXO
0748−676 and typically ∼ 45◦ in the other sources, the higher value of τ by a factor of ∼ 2 can be
explained if the corona has an aspect ratio of ∼ 3:1. Combined with Zhang et al. (2014), who found
evidence for a ﬂattened corona in the HSS dipper 4U 1915-05, the present study further suggests
that the CC in the LMXBs has an oblate shape in general, although its exact geometry is yet to be
quantiﬁed.

The present results are very similar to the reported evidence for ﬂattened coronae in BHBs
in the LHS by Makishima (2007) and Heil et al. (2015). Especially, Heil et al. (2015) reported
that ﬂattened coronae are present in a wide range of hard and intermediate states. In summary,
we suggest that the ﬂattened coronal shape is common to LMXBs and BHBs, and to be rather
independent of their spectral states.

Fig. 1.— Suzaku light curves and hardness ratio of EXO 0748−676 with a time binsize of 128 s
(left panels), and those folded on Porb = 13766.8 s with 64 phase bins per period after excluding the
bursts (right panels), where phase 0 (= 1) refers to 06:12:03 of 2007 December 25. Panels (a) and
(a′) show the background-subtracted 0.6 − 10 keV XIS light curves (averaged between XIS 0 and
XIS 3). Panels (b) and (b′) show NXB-subtracted 12 − 55 keV HXD-PIN light curves, including
the CXB contribution by ∼ 0.02 cts s−1. The HXD-PIN vs. XIS hardness ratios are shown in (c)
and (c′).
