We perform a Taylor series expansion of Tsallis distribution by assum-
ing the Tsallis parameter q close to 1. The q value shows the deviation
of a system from a thermalised Boltzmann distribution. By taking up to
ﬁrst order in (q − 1), we derive an analytical result for Tsallis distribution
including radial ﬂow. Further, in the present work, we also study the speed
of sound (cs) as a function of temperature using the non-extensive Tsallis
statistics for diﬀerent q values and for diﬀerent mass cut-oﬀs.

1. Introduction

Tsallis distribution has been successful in explaining the transverse mo-
mentum spectra observed at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)
and at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) with a non-extensive parameter q.
Here q shows the deviation of a system from a thermalised Boltzmann sys-
tem. We incorporate the radial ﬂow in the Tsallis statistics by using Taylor
series expansion to get an analytical expression. It is believed that c2
s in the
hadronic medium decreases to zero in the ﬁrst order phase transition from
hadronic phase to QGP phase. Therefore, the study of c2
s is important to
locate the QCD phase boundary.

One obtains the relevant thermodynamical quantities by using f q[1]. As-
suming the non-extensive parameter q close to 1, Tsallis distribution func-
tion, f q, can be expanded in Taylor series in (q − 1), which is given by,

This result is used to calculate the momentum spectra [1]. In Fig. 1 we show
ﬁts to the normalized diﬀerential π− yields in (0− 5)% Pb+Pb collisions at
√
sNN = 2.76 TeV with the Tsallis (solid line) and Boltzmann distributions
(dashed line). Also, ﬁts with the Tsallis distribution keeping terms to ﬁrst
order (dash-dotted line) and second order in (q − 1) (dotted line) are shown
in Fig. 1. In Fig. 2 the ﬁts are with the Tsallis distribution including ﬂow
keeping terms to ﬁrst order in (q − 1) (dashed line). The ﬂow velocity is
ﬁxed at v = 0.609, with T = 146 MeV, q = 1.030 and the radius of the
volume is R = 29.8 fm. The lower part of the ﬁgures show the deviation
from data points. For truncation of the series expansion up to the ﬁrst order
with pure Tsallis distribution, one needs to satisfy two conditions [1], i.e.

T < 1 and q|1 − q|(cid:16) E

3. Momentum spectra including radial ﬂow in (q − 1)

In order to incorporate the eﬀect of radial ﬂow on the momentum spectra
and to see how it could improve to explain the momentum spectra obtained
in Pb+Pb collisions, we have included a constant ﬂow velocity, v, and the
invariant yield is given by,

4. Speed of Sound in a Physical Hadron Resonance Gas

For a physical hadron resonance gas, we use Tsallis form of Fermi-Dirac
(FD) and Bose-Einstein (BE) statistics according to particle species [2],
which is given by,

fT (E) ≡

the ± sign in the denominator stands for FD and BE respectively. In the
limit q → 1, expq reduces to the standard exponential. The square of speed
of sound is the change in pressure with change in energy density, which is
given by

plotted as a function of temperature in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, taking diﬀerent
mass cut-oﬀs for q=1.05 and q=1.15.

5. Summary

Taylor series expansion of Tsallis distribution in (q − 1) is used to in-
troduce the radial ﬂow in an analytic way in addition to the study of the
degree of deviation from equilibrium Boltzmann distribution. The pT spec-
tra for 0-5 % central Pb+Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV is well described with
inclusion of radial ﬂow up to ﬁrst order in (q − 1). The speed of sound
for physical resonance gas has been calculated for diﬀerent non-extensive
parameters q. Further, taking higher q values seems to increase the speed
of sound near the limiting temperature (TH ) as compared to the extensive
Boltzmann statistics. For higher q values the critical behaviour of speed
of sound occurs earlier as compared to extensive statistics, which indicates
an earlier phase transition in non-extensive statistics. This seems to be a
function of degree of deviation from equilibrium statistics.
