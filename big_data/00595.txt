Gravitation, holographic principle, and extra

dimensions

Abstract

Within the context of Newton’s theory of gravitation, restricted to
point-like test particles and central bodies, stable circular orbits in
ordinary space are related to stable circular paths on a massless, un-
movable, undeformable vortex-like surface, under the action of a tidal
gravitational ﬁeld along the symmetry axis. An interpretation is made
in the light of a holographic principle, in the sense that motions in or-
dinary space are connected with motions on a selected surface and
vice versa. Then ordinary space is conceived as a 3-hypersurface
bounding a n-hypervolume where gravitation takes origin, within a
n-hyperspace. The extension of the holographic principle to extra
dimensions implies the existence of a minimum distance where test
particles may still be considered as distinct from the central body.
Below that threshold, it is inferred test particles lose theirs individu-
ality and “glue” to the central body via uniﬁcation of the four known
interactions and, in addition, (i) particles can no longer be conceived
as point-like but e.g., strings or membranes, and (ii) quantum eﬀects
are dominant and matter turns back to a pre-big bang state. A more
detailed formulation including noncircular motions within the context
of general relativity, together with further knowledge on neutron stars,

Introduction

According to current QCDM cosmologies, the universe as a whole is increas-
ingly expanding e.g., [1] which cannot be true for subsystems. For instance,
massive (exceeding about 20 solar masses) stars at the end of evolution are no
longer pressure-balanced and collapse into a black hole e.g., [2] where matter
may safely be conceived as turned into a pre-big bang state, implying uniﬁca-
tion of the four known interactions as predicted by supersymmetric theories
e.g., [3]. In the light of general relativity, the ﬁnal conﬁguration is point-like
but the occurrence of quantum eﬀects could yield strings or membranes, leav-
ing the gravitational ﬁeld outside the instability region (where test particles
cannot remain in stable equilibrium) spherical-symmetric. Deeper investiga-
tion on neutron stars and quark stars (if their existence is proved), which are
celestial bodies most similar to black holes, could provide further insight on
the formulation of quantum gravity.

A simpliﬁed description can be made within the framework of Newton’s
theory of gravitation, where spherical-symmetric matter distributions can be
conceived as point-like outside their boundaries. The concept of space cur-
vature may be introduced considering a vortex-like surface under the action
of a tidal gravitational ﬁeld along the symmetry axis, where the distance of a
surface point from the symmetry axis relates to the distance of a test particle
from a central body. The current paper aims to answer two speciﬁc questions
restricted, for simplicity, to circular motions.

First, could stable circular orbits (radius, R) described by a test particle
(mass, m) around a central body (mass, M) be related to stable circular
paths described by a test particle (mass, m) on a massless, unmovable, un-
deformable vortex-like surface, subjected to a constant gravitational force,
−GMm/R2, directed downwards along the symmetry axis? If yes, a princi-
ple of corresponding states could be expressed as a holographic principle in
the sense that motions in ordinary space are connected with motions on a
selected surface and vice versa.

Second, could the above mentioned holographic principle be extended to
ordinary space, conceived as a 3-hypersurface, where test particles are sub-
jected to a constant gravitational force from extra dimensions? If yes, could
quantum eﬀects and uniﬁcation of the four known interactions be interpreted

2

in this context?

The ﬁrst and second question raised are dealt with in Section 2 and 3,
respectively. The discussion is drawn in Section 4. The conclusion is shown
in Section 5. A special vortex-like surface and an analogy for the invariance
of light velocity are presented in Appendix A and B, respectively.

2 A holographic principle

Let a test particle of mass, m, move along a stable circular orbit of radius,
R, around a central body of mass, M. Let both the test particle and the
central body be conceived as point-like. The balance of gravitational and
centrifugal force at a generic point of the orbit, after little algebra reads:

V 2 =

GM
R

;

(1)

where G is the constant of gravitation and V the circular velocity.

Let a vortex-like, massless, unmovable, undeformable surface (in short,
surface) be subjected to a tidal gravitational ﬁeld along the symmetry axis,
implying constant attraction directed downwards, as depicted in Fig. 1. Let
the surface be deﬁned as z = f (w), w2 = x2+y2, with the following boundary
conditions:

lim

w→∓∞

df
dw

= 0± ;

lim
w→0∓

df
dw

= ±∞ ;

(2)

where the vertical axis is directed downwards. Let P ≡ (w, z) be a generic
point on the surface; w0, z0, the intercepts of a tangent to the surface, lying
on a meridional plane and crossing P, and θ the angle deﬁned by the tangent
and the axis, w, see Fig. 1.

The equation of the tangent is:

w0z + z0w = w0z0 ;
tan θ = −

= −

z0
w0

z0 − z

w

;

−w tan θ > 0 ;

(3)

(4)

where θ → 0± implies w → ∓∞, z → 0+, and θ → (π/2)∓ implies w → 0∓,
z → +∞. The evaluation of θ needs the knowledge of the surface equation.
With regard to a test particle on a selected point, P, of the surface, the
gravitational force, Fg, can be splitted into a normal component, Fg cos θ,
balanced by the reaction due to surface unmovability and undeformability,
and a tangential component, Fg sin θ, directed downwards i.e. towards in-
creasing z, see Fig. 1. Similarly, the centrifugal force, Fc, can be splitted into

3

a normal component, Fc sin θ, balanced by the reaction due to surface unmov-
ability and undeformability, and a tangential component, Fc cos θ, directed
upwards i.e. towards increasing |w|, see Fig. 1.
Fg sin θ + Fc cos θ = 0. The choice, Fg = GMm/R2, translates into:

Motion along a stable circular path, |w| = const, z = const, implies

v2 = −

GM
R

w
R

tan θ =

GM
R

z0 − z

R

;

where v is the circular velocity.

The combination of Eqs. (1) and (5) yields:

v2
V 2 = −

w
R

tan θ =

z0 − z

R

;

and the substitution of Eq. (4) into (6) produces:

w =

v2
V 2

R
z0

w0 ;

(5)

(6)

(7)

where the intercepts of the equation of the tangent, w0 and z0, see Fig. 1,
can be determined using the surface equation, z = f (w). In the special case
where the meridional section of the surface shows branches of equilateral
hyperbola, one ﬁnds w0/z0 = w/z and Eq. (7) reduces to:

z
R

=

v2
V 2

;

(8)

for a formal demonstration, an interested reader is addressed to Appendix
A.

The above results may be summarized into a single statement.

Holographic principle. Given a central body of mass, M, and a vortex-
like, unmovable, undeformable surface subjected to a tidal gravitational ﬁeld
along the symmetry axis, implying constant attraction directed downwards,
any test particle moving on a stable circular orbit of radius, R, and velocity,
V , has a counterpart on the vortex-like surface, moving along a stable circular
path of radius, |w|, and velocity, v, around the symmetry axis, where w =
(v/V )2(R/z0)w0.

In general, the above statement should be conceived as a principle of
corresponding states: the term “holographic” has to be intended in the sense
that motions in ordinary space are connected with motions on a selected
surface and vice versa.

4

The above considerations could, in principle, be extended to general rela-
tivity but, for simplicity, are restricted to classical mechanics, which implies
velocities up to inﬁnity. If light velocity is assumed as an empirical upper
limit, v ≤ c, stable orbits cannot occur below a critical radius, Rc, expressed
via Eq. (1) as:

Rc =

GM
c2

;

(9)

according to Newton’s theory of gravitation. Its counterpart in general rela-
tivity, using Schwarzschild’s metric, reads e.g., [4]:

Rc =

3GM

c2

;

(10)

which is three times larger.

Similarly, stable circular paths on a vortex-like surface, centered on the
symmetry axis, cannot occur below a critical radius, |wc|, expressed via
Eqs. (7) and (9) as:

wc = Rc

w0
z0

=

GM
c2

w0
z0

;

(11)

where v = V = c.

3 Gravitation and extra dimensions

Let ordinary space be conceived as a 3-hypersurface bounding a n-hypervolume,
totally (n = 4) or partially (n > 4). Let the source of the gravitational ﬁeld
lie within the hypervolume and let the hypersurface be curved in presence of
matter via gravitational interaction. To this respect, the following analogy
can help.

With regard to a planet surrounded by a liquid shell, a global ocean say,
the source of the gravitational ﬁeld within the hypervolume is represented by
the whole planet and matter within the hypersurface by the water surface,
respectively. In absence of matter (empty ordinary space), the water surface
is totally ﬂat. In presence of negligible amount of matter, the water surface
can be considered ﬂat to a good extent. In presence of considerable amount
of matter, the water surface is curved by gravitational interaction. A test
particle on the curved surface is subjected to the tangential component of
the gravitational force, as the normal component is balanced by the surface
tension. In principle, the curvature angle with respect to the horizontal plane
ranges from θ = 0 (vortex top) to θ = ∓π/2 (vortex bottom).

5

Keeping in mind the above mentioned analogy, let the whole range of
curvature be represented as an equilateral hyperbolic funnell i.e. a revolution
ﬁgure related to the rotation of the bottom branch of an equilateral hyperbola
around the axis, z, as depicted in Fig. 1, where the axis, w, w2 = x2 + y2,
lies on the horizontal plane and the axis, z, is directed along the free-fall
direction within the hyperspace. Accordingly, the equation of the funnell,
via Eq. (18) in Appendix A, reads:

(x2 + y2)z2 = k2 ;

z > 0 ;

(12)

due to the symmetry with respect to the rotation axis, z.

Let a test particle of mass, m, move on a stable circular orbit of radius, R,
around a central body of mass, M, both conceived as point-like for simplicity.
Let Fg, FG; Fc, FC; denote gravitational and centrifugal forces acting on
the test particle within the hypersurface (ordinary space) and hypervolume
(hyperspace), respectively, which implies the following relations:

FG sin θ + FC cos θ = 0 ;
GMm

Fg = FG sin θ = −
Fc = FC cos θ =

mV 2

R

;

(13)

(14)

(15)

R2

;

where G is the constant of gravitation and V the orbital velocity. The com-
bination of Eqs. (13)-(15) yields Eq. (1) and, in particular, Eq. (9) assuming
light velocity as an empirical upper limit.

The gravitational force within the hypervolume via Eq. (14) reads:

FG = −

GMm
R2 sin θ

;

(16)

where R2 sin θ = const according to the assumption of hypersurface where
test particles are subjected to a constant gravitational force, FG, from extra
dimensions along the symmetry axis. Then θ → 0 implies R → +∞ and,
in addition, R2 sin θ = R2
In general, the
following relation holds:

0, where R0 relates to θ = π/2.

θ = arcsin(cid:18)R0
R (cid:19)

2

;

(17)

in terms of the orbit radius, R. On the other hand, R0 → 0 can be inferred
from general relativity e.g., [5], and a nonzero R0 can be interpreted as due
to quantum eﬀects, which act to “close” the bottom of the funnell.

6

Let a ﬁnite matter distribution, spherical-symmetric for simplicity, be de-
ﬁned by a total mass, M, within a ﬁnite radius, R. Accordingly, curvature
eﬀects are directly proportional to the angle, θ, between the horizontal axis
and the tangent on a selected point, with regard to a meridional section of
the funnell, as depicted in Fig. 2. Curvature eﬀects are larger on the surface,
which can be related to the angle, θ = θinf, involving the inﬂexion point of
related meridional section. Within the matter distribution, curvature eﬀects
are reduced due to Newton’s theorem e.g., [6] and removed at the centre,
where no gravitational attraction takes place as (in the current interpreta-
tion) the gravitational force, FG, has null tangential component.

The velocity of a test particle in a stable circular orbit, on the surface
of the matter distribution, is increasing for decreasing R until V = c for
R = Rc. Lower radii, R < Rc, would imply a vortex-like distorsion but the
bottom of the funnel is expected to be “closed” by quantum eﬀects behind
a threshold, R = Rmin ≥ R0, related to θ = θmax ≤ π/2. For R < Rmin,
θ < θmax, up to R = 0, θ = 0, where no gravitational attraction takes place,
as expected. Accordingly, θc ≤ θmax ≤ π/2, which implies Rc ≥ Rmin ≥ R0,
via Eq. (17).
If, in particular, Rc = (3/2)Rg, Rmin = R0 = Rg, where
Rg = 2GM/c2, with regard to Schwarzschild black holes in general relativity
e.g., [7] (Chap. XI, §97), then Eq. (17) reduces to θc = arcsin(Rmin/Rc)2 =
arcsin(4/9) ≈ 0.1466π.
In summary, stable circular orbits of test particles around a central body
can occur for R ≥ Rc, implying V ≤ c, while the motion of test particles
is unstable for R < Rc up to R = Rmin. Beyond that threshold, quantum
eﬀects are expected to be dominant and test particles are “glued” to the
central body.

4 Discussion

According to the holographic principle inferred in Section 2, stable circular
orbits of a test particle of mass, m, around a central body of mass, M,
can be related to stable circular paths of a test particle of mass, m, on a
vortex-like, massless, unmovable, undeformable surface, subjected to a tidal
gravitational ﬁeld along the symmetry axis, implying constant attraction
directed downwards. In other words, the gravitational action on the ordinary
space can be related to the gravitational action on an axisymmetric surface.
By analogy, the gravitational action on a n-hyperspace can be related to the
gravitational action on an axisymmetric 3-hypersurface, coinciding with the
ordinary space. For reasons of simplicity, considerations have been restricted
to circular motions within Newton’s theory of gravitation, but it can safely

7

be expected an extension to generic motions within the theory of general
relativity.

If gravitational attraction takes origin from a n-hypervolume, the ori-
gin of (ordinary) space curvature is no longer due to matter in itself, but
to gravitation from extra dimensions. Then matter appears to be entirely
passive, in the sense that it can no longer be thought of as source of gravita-
tional ﬁeld. In this view, extra dimensions extend as well as ordinary ones,
contrary to assumptions of superstring theories, where extra dimensions are
highly compressed e.g., [3].

The main consequence of the above mentioned analogy is the occurrence
of quantum eﬀects, in the sense that a test particle can approach a central
body (both considered as point-like) up to a threshold, R = Rmin, preserv-
ing its intrinsic properties. A physical interpretation could be the following.
First, for suﬃciently short distances, masses can no longer be conceived as
point-like, but perhaps as strings or membranes, similarly to charged par-
ticles e.g., protons and electrons, where the electric charge cannot be con-
ceived as point-like. Second, for suﬃciently large densities, the four known
interactions are expected to be uniﬁed into a superinteraction, according to
supersymmetric theories e.g., [3], where particles could be “glued” similarly
to quarks into adrons. In other words, the occurrence of a superinteraction
implies matter returns to a pre-big bang state.

5 Conclusion

Within the context of Newton’s theory of gravitation, for an assigned (point-
like) test particle and (point-like) central body, stable circular orbits in ordi-
nary space have been related to stable circular paths on a vortex-like, mass-
less, unmovable, undeformable surface, subjected to a tidal gravitational ﬁeld
along the symmetry axis, implying constant attraction directed downwards,
and a holographic principle has been proposed. If ordinary space is conceived
as a 3-hypersurface bounding a n-hypervolume where gravitational interac-
tion takes origin, the extension of the above mentioned holographic principle
has implied a minimum distance behind which test particles lose theirs in-
dividuality (intended as collection of intrinsic properties) and “glue” to the
central body via uniﬁcation of the four known interactions, behind which (i)
particles can no longer be conceived as point-like but perhaps as strings or
membranes, and (ii) quantum eﬀects are dominant and matter returns to a
pre-big bang state.

The generalization of the procedure to noncircular motions within the
context of general relativity, together with further knowledge about neutron

8

stars, quark stars, black holes, e.g., [8] could provide further insight on the
formulation of quantum gravity.

A A guidance example

As a guidance example, let the meridional section of the vortex-like surface
coincide with branches of equilateral hyperbola, as:

wz = ∓k ;

(18)

where the right-hand side is positive or negative according if the hyperbola
branch lies on the fourth or third quadrant, respectively, see Fig. 1. Let
P ≡ (wP , zP ) be a generic point on the hyperbola.

9

The intersection of the hyperbola with a generic straight line, expressed

as:

z = aw + b ;

(19)

can be inferred via substitution of Eq. (19) into (18), as solution of the related
second-degree equation in w. The result is:

wP = −b ∓ √b2 ∓ 4ak

;

(20)

where the double signs are uncorrelated.

The straight line is tangent to an hyperbola branch provided the discrim-

inant is null, as:

accordingly, the coordinates of the tangential point are:

accordingly, θ is positive or negative if related to an hyperbola branch lying

The substitution of Eqs. (25) and (26) into (7) after little algebra pro-

duces:

zP =

(28)

which is equivalent to Eq. (8) and, in particular, v = V implies zP = R;
v = V = c implies zP = Rc = GM/c2.

B An analogy for light velocity invariance

Let bodies (particles, in particular) be conceived as spherical vessels moving
on a global ocean. Let light be conceived as a circular wave on the ocean
which can be induced via e.g., vessel oscillations along the vertical direction.
Then waves propagate on the ocean surface, regardless of vessel motion. The
concept of “light velocity in vacuum” appears to be meaningless e.g., [9] in
that, according to current cosmologies, space is permeated by a sort of dark
energy e.g., [1] and, on the other hand, quantum vacuum is also permeated
by (minimum) energy e.g., [10].

Conceptually, wave velocity can be determined in the following way. Let
vessels move between equally spaced series of buoies, similarly to electric
trains between high-voltage tralisses. Let ∆s be the distance between adja-
cent buoies (along motion direction), and let ∆t be the time of wave propa-
gation between adjacent buoies (along motion direction) which, in principle,
can be determined from vessels. Accordingly, wave velocity can be inferred
as vw = ∆s/∆t, regardless of vessel motion i.e. reference frame comoving
with a vessel.

In addition, wave velocity cannot be exceeded by vessel velocity, v < vw.
The limit, v → vw, would imply vessels be turned into water, where waves
can propagate.
Finally, the reference frame comoving with the ocean i.e. at rest with

respect to the ocean can be conceived as “privileged”.

As mentioned in Section 3, ordinary space can be related to ocean surface

and extra dimensions to ocean volume.

The angle, θ, can be inferred from the equation of the surface, z = f (w),
