Abstract: We derive a precise dictionary between micro-state geometries and open
string condensates for a large class of excitations of four dimensional BPS black holes
realised in terms of D3-branes intersecting on a six-torus. The complete multipole
expansion of the supergravity solutions at weak coupling is extracted from string
amplitudes involving one massless closed string and multiple open strings insertions
on disks with mixed boundary conditions.

1. Introduction

The fuzzball proposal [1, 2] relates black-hole micro-states to smooth and horizon-less
geometries with the same asymptotics (the same mass and charges) as the putative
black hole but diﬀering from it in its interior. The (semi)classical black-hole geometry
only results from a coarse-graining approximation of the micro-state solutions. For
black holes corresponding to D-brane bound-states, the micro-states can be realised
and counted in terms of open-string excitations of the D-branes constituents [3, 4].
As a result, the fuzzball proposal suggests a one-to-one correspondence between
open-string condensates and the geometries generated by them.

The best understood example is the two-charge BPS system in type IIB theory for
which the whole family of micro-state geometries is known [5, 6]. The solutions can
be written in several diﬀerent U-duality related frames. In [7], the asymptotic form
of the general micro-state geometries associated to a system of D1- and D5-branes
has been derived from disk amplitudes computing the emission rate of closed string
states from open string condensates at the D1-D5 intersections. The two-charge
system represents a somewhat degenerate example of a black hole in that its classical
geometry has a singular horizon of zero size. Smooth horizons in the supergravity
limit require systems with 3- or 4-charges. Unfortunately, despite signiﬁcant progress
(see [8]-[17] and references therein for recent results and reviews), a similar analysis
for 3- and 4-charge black holes is still missing since a family of micro-state solutions
large enough to account for the black hole entropy is not yet known.

Aim of this paper is to partially ﬁll in this gap, providing a direct link between
micro-state geometries and open string condensates for a large class of 4-charge black
hole microstates. We realise the four-dimensional BPS black holes in the ‘democratic’
frame of four mutually intersecting stacks of D3-branes on T 6. We focus on a family of
black hole solutions characterised by eight (‘lovely’ rather than ‘hateful’) harmonic
functions in the type IIB theory. This family is dual to the extensively studied
BPS solutions [18]-[23] describing D0-D2-D4-D6 brane bound-states in the type IIA
theory or intersecting M2 and M5 branes in M-theory carrying non-trivial momentum
and KK monopole charge. Amusingly, in the D3-brane frame, the eight harmonic
functions are described entirely in terms of excitations of the metric and the four-form
RR ﬁeld.

The micro-state geometries will be derived from disk amplitudes computing the
emission rate of massless closed string states from open string condensates binding
the diﬀerent stacks of D3 branes. The disk amplitude computes the leading correc-
tion to the supergravity solution in the limit of small string coupling gs. In principle
the supergravity solution can be recovered by plugging the result into the type IIB
equations of motion and solving recursively order by order in gs. Equivalently, one
can expand the general micro-state solution to order gs and match it against the
result of the string amplitude. Proceeding in this way, we identify three class of

– 2 –

micro-states depending on whether the open string condensate involves either one
D3-brane stack or the intersection of two or four diﬀerent stacks. We dub the three
classes as L, K and M solutions referring to the names of the harmonic functions
underlying the solutions. We remark that disk contributions add and at this lin-
ear order both the metric and the four-form potential can be written as a sum of
harmonic functions. In particular, we ﬁnd that four of the harmonic functions (L)
specifying the solution are associated to the four diﬀerent disks with a single bound-
ary, three harmonic functions (K) are associated to the three inequivalent 2-charge
intersections and the last one (M) is sourced by a 4-charge open string condensate.
The three types of micro-state geometries fall oﬀ at inﬁnity as Qi/r, QiQj/r2 and
Q1Q2Q3Q4/r3 respectively. Higher multipole modes are generated by insertions of
untwisted (boundary-preserving) open strings on the boundary of the disk, much
in the same way as for the D1-D5 system [11]. Remarkably, as we will see, the
micro-state angular momentum is fully accounted for by the type K component of
the solution.

Solutions of type M are particularly interesting since the number of disks with
four diﬀerent boundaries grows with the product of the four charges N = Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4,
the same quartic invariant entering in the black-hole entropy formula S = 2π√N.
It is tempting to speculate that after quantization the corresponding micro-states
may account for the entropy of the putative black-hole much in the same way as the
entropy of the 2-charge system with N = Q1Q2 is reproduced by quantisation of the
proﬁle function describing D1-D5 intersections [5, 24] or, equivalently, D3-D3’ pair
intersections, in the systems that we consider here1.

We remark that the class of 4-charge micro-state solutions generated by open
string condensates that we ﬁnd here is larger than the family of supergravity solutions
explicitly known. This is at variant with the 2-charge systems, where the most general
micro-state [6] is reproduced by 2-charge intersections [7]. In the case of 4 charges we
ﬁnd new solutions looking pretty much like the K and M solutions, but tilted with
respect to the background D3-brane geometry. It would be interesting to understand
whether these could be accommodated in a larger class of micro-state geomatries or
should be excluded on the basis of supersymmetry or stability conditions (D- and
F-ﬂatness) for the open strings.

The plan of the paper is as follows.

In Section 1 we introduce the ‘eight-ful’
harmonic family of supergravity solutions in the ‘democratic’ frame of D3-branes.
We identify three sub-classes of solutions that we dub L solutions, K solutions and
M solutions. In Section 2, we focus on solutions sourced by disks with a single type
of boundary condition. We compute disk amplitudes involving the insertion of a
closed string NS-NS or R-R vertex operator in the bulk and an arbitrary number
In Section 3, we compute disk amplitudes with
of untwisted open string scalars.

1Indeed, in our case, any pair of D3-branes intersect along a string in T 6 and can be mapped

into D1-D5 or F1-P1 via U-dualities.

– 3 –

two twisted open string insertions that intertwine between two diﬀerent boundary
conditions. In Section 4, we compute disk amplitudes with four diﬀerent boundaries
conditions. The computations are much more involved (they are equivalent to a 6-
point open string amplitude) but one can numerically integrate the ﬁnal correlators
and get a ﬁnite result both for NS-NS and R-R closed string insertions in the bulk.
Remarkably, NS-NS and R-R correlators are proportional to the same integrals,
so their numeric values are irrelevant for the identiﬁcation of the dual supergravity
solution. We ﬁnally draw our conclusions and indicate directions for further research.
In the appendices we collect our conventions for string correlators and present the
derivation of the D3-brane solution starting from its T-dual description in Type IIA
theory.

2. Supergravity solution

We consider four-dimensional BPS black hole solutions of type IIB supergravity
consisting of D3-branes intersecting on T 6. The solutions are characterised by a non-
trivial metric and a ﬁve-form ﬂux with all the other ﬁelds of type IIB supergravity
vanishing. In this sector, the type IIB equations of motion take the extremely simple
and elegant form2

A family of solutions can be found by acting with three T-dualities on the more
familiar class [21, 23] describing systems of D0-D2-D4-D6 branes in type IIA theory
(see Appendix for details). The solutions can be written in terms of eight harmonic
functions (a = 1, . . . 8, I = 1, 2, 3)

Solutions with non-zero KI and M will be associated to condensates involving
twisted open strings. These excitations modify the geometry of the putative black
hole in its interior while preserving the same asymptotic fall oﬀ at inﬁnity. Con-
sequently, KI and M should decay faster than |x|−1 at inﬁnity. We thus focus on

or, equivalently, that the function µ deﬁned in (2.4) starts at order 1/r3, in contrast
with ZI and PI that start at order 1/r and 1/r2, respectively. Since at linear order in
αD3, the harmonic functions entering in the solution simply add, we can consider the
contribution of each harmonic function separately. More precisely, we deﬁne three
basic classes of solutions: L solutions are associated to the harmonic functions LI and
V with KI = M = 0. K solutions are generated by turning on a single KI harmonic
function for a given I and taking M = −KI. Finally M solutions are associated to

the orthogonal combination M +PI KI that is generated at order 1/r3. In other

words the dipole modes of M and KI in (2.8) vanish in this class.

The family (2.5) can be seen as the “superposition” of these three basic classes
of solutions. We remark that disks emissions simply add but massless closed string
states interact with each other. This entails non-linearity, so the resulting solution
will not be the naive “superposition” of its constituents as it is obvious from (2.5).
In the rest of this section, we display the supergravity solutions for the three basic
classes of micro-state geometries.

2.1 L solutions

A representative of the L class of micro-state solutions is given by taking

V = L(x)

M = KI = 0

LI = 1

in (2.5). This results into

dA = ∗3dL

˜eI = d˜yI

α0 = A

This solution is generated by distributing D3-branes of type 0 in table 1 along R3.
Similar solutions are found by turning on LI associated to the other three types of
D3-branes in the table3.

2.2 K solutions

Next we consider solutions with

K3 = −M = K(x)
For this choice one ﬁnds

µ = 0

LI = V = 1

K1 = K2 = 0

(2.13)

e−2U = 1

α0 = βI = 0

∗3dw = −dK

˜e1 = d˜y1

˜e2 = d˜y2

α1 = α2 = −(dt + w)

α3 = −dt

˜e3 = d˜y3 − K dy3

β0 = dt (2.14)

and the resulting supergravity solution reduces to (discarding d-exact terms)

ds2 = −(dt + w)2 +
C4 = −(dt + w) ∧ ˜e3 ∧ (dy1 ∧ d˜y2 + d˜y1 ∧ dy2)

i(cid:1) − 2 K dy3 d˜y3 + K 2 dy2

(2.15)

Similar solutions are found by turning on K1 or K2. We would like to stress that K
solutions in general carry angular momentum, unlike L and M solutions.

2.3 M solutions

Finally we consider solutions with

K2 = M = M(x)

µ = M

LI = V = 1

K1 = K3 = 0

(2.16)

Now one ﬁnds

e−2U = √1 − M 2
˜e1 = d˜y1 + M dy1
α0 = −Mdt
α1 = α3 = −dt
1 − M 2
β0 = (1 − M 2) dt + (1 + M 2) w2

˜e3 = d˜y3 + M dy3 w = 0

˜e2 = d˜y2
α2 = −dt + w2
β1 = β3 = M(dt − w2)

dw2 = −∗3dM (2.17)

β2 = M dt

The Type IIB supergravity solution reads (discarding d-exact terms)

The harmonic functions Ha entering into the supergravity solutions can be conve-

(2.20)

with Pi1...in(x) a totally symmetric and traceless rank n tensor providing a basis of

multi-pole expansion

and so on. We notice that even if the explicit form of Pi1...in(x) can quickly become
messy as n grows, the form of the Fourier transform is very simply. Indeed writing

one ﬁnds that the Fourier transform of the harmonic functions Pi1...in(x) are simply
polynomials of the momenta divided by k2

˜Pi1...in(k) =

(2.25)

Disk amplitudes will be conveniently written in this basis. We notice that even if
the single harmonic components Pi1...in(x) are singular at the origin, in analogy with
the 2-charge case [25, 2], one may expect that for a generic choice of the coeﬃcients
ci1...in the inﬁnite sum (2.20) produce a fuzzy and smooth geometry.

3. Disk amplitudes and 1-charge microstates

At weak coupling, the gravitational background generated by a D-brane state can be
extracted from a disk amplitude involving the insertion of a closed string states in
the bulk and open string states specifying the D-brane micro-state on the boundary.
The open string state, or condensate, is speciﬁed by a boundary operator O given

– 8 –

by a trace along the boundary of the disk of a product of constant open string ﬁelds.
The proﬁle of a supergravity ﬁeld Φ in the micro-state geometry can be reconstructed
from the string amplitude AΦ,O(k) after Fourier transform in the momentum k of
the closed string state. Moreover, since we consider constant open string ﬁelds we
can take all open string momenta to vanish. For simplicity, we take kyI = k˜yI = 0
and set k0 = 0, so that the only non vanishing components of the closed string
momentum ki lay along the 3 non compact space directions. In order to keep the
mass-shell condition k2 = 0, we analytically continue ki to complex values, and
i ≈ 0. More precisely, the deviation δ ˜Φ(k) from ﬂat space of a ﬁeld ˜Φ(k)
require Σik2
is extracted from the string amplitude via the bulk-to-boundary formula

δ ˜Φ(k) =(cid:18)−

i

k2(cid:19) δAΦ,O(k)

δΦ

(3.1)

with (−i/k2) denoting the massless closed string propagator for the (transverse)
physical modes.

We notice that the limit of zero momenta for open string states is well deﬁned
only in the case the disk diagram cannot factorize into two or more disks via the
exchange of open string states.
Indeed, in presence of factorization channels the
string amplitude has poles in the open string momenta and the underlying world-
sheet integral diverges. We will always carefullly choose the open string polarisations
in such a way that no factorization channels be allowed. As a result, one ﬁnds that,

up to 1/k2, δeΦ(k) is a polynomial in ki and therefore can be expressed as a linear

combination of harmonic functions ˜Pi1...in(k) in momentum space

In this section we illustrate the stringy description of the micro-state geometry for
the very familiar case of parallel (wrapped) D3-branes. The vacua of this system
are parametrised by the expectation values of the (three) scalar ﬁelds φi, along the
non-compact directions. The general open string condensate involves an arbitrary
number of insertions of the ‘untwisted’ ﬁeld φi on the boundary of the disk. On
the other hand, the associated micro-state geometry is described by a D3-brane
solution characterised by a smooth multi-pole harmonic function determined by the
open string condensate [26]. The string computation will allow us to ﬁx the relative
normalisation between the NS and RR vertices that will be used in the analysis of
2- and 4-charge intersections in the next sections.

3.1 L solutions at weak coupling

We start by considering the supergravity solution generated by a single stack of D3-
branes, let us say of type 0. The gravity solution is given by (2.12). At linear order

with E = h + b the polarization tensor containing the ﬂuctuation h of the metric
and b of the B-ﬁeld and cN S a normalisation constant. The momentum of the closed
string state will be labeled by k. Henceforth we denote by X(z) the holomorphic
part of the closed string ﬁeld X(z, ¯z) = X(z) + RX(¯z) with R the reﬂection matrix
implementing the boundary conditions on the disk. More precisely, R is a diagonal
matrix with plus one (+1) and minus one (-1) along the Neumann and Dirichelet
directions, respectively. In particular for a disk of type 0, we have plus along t, yI
and minus along xi, ˜yI. Consequently kR = −k. We choose length units whereby
α′ = 2. Moreover we exploit SL(2, R) invariance of the disk to ﬁx the positions of the
closed string and the ﬁrst of the open string insertions. Other open string vertices
are integrated along the real line to take into account all possible orderings of the
insertions.

4Here the correlator is evaluated for generic n 6= 0 and the n = 0 term is obtained by extrapola-
tion. A direct evaluation of this term is subtler since there are not enough insertions to completely
ﬁx the SL(2, R) world-sheet invariance.

(3.14)

In particular, the harmonic function for a single D3-brane at position a, is realized
by taking

ξ(φ) ∼ ei a φ

(3.15)

that reproduces the multipole expansion (2.21) of L(x) according to (3.13). Similar
results can be found by considering disks ending on D3-branes associated to the
harmonic functions LI.

We conclude by observing that D- and F-ﬂatness conditions may restrict the
choices for ξi1...in. Indeed for pointlike branes, the ﬂatness conditions require [φi, φj] =
0, so the matrices φi can be simultaneously diagonalized and written in terms of N0
positions in R3 [26].

δgM N dxM dxN = −2 dt w − 2 K dy3 ˜dy3 + . . .

In this section we compute the disk amplitude generating the metric of the K so-
lutions. K solutions will be associated to string fermionic bilinears localised at the
intersections of two D3-branes. The relevant string amplitude has been computed in
[7] for the case of D1-D5-branes. Here we review this computation, adapting it to
the case of D3-branes, and include the eﬀect of untwisted open string insertions in
order to account for higher multi-pole modes of the harmonic function K.

We consider a non-trivial open string condensate
OAB = tr ¯µ(AµB) ξ(φ)

(4.6)

with ¯µA a fermionic excitation of the open string starting from D30 and ending
on D33 and µB a fermion excitation of the open string with opposite orientation.
Here and below we denote with trace the sum over Chan-Paton indices along the
boundary of the disk. We organise states in representations of the SO(1, 5) Lorentz
symmetry rotating the six-dimensional hyper-plane along which the two stacks of
branes are NN or DD, i.e. the space-time and the y3, ˜y3 directions. Upper (lower)
indices A = 1, . . . 4 and M = 1, . . . 6 run over the right (left) spinor and vector
representations of this group, respectively. The projection onto the symmetric part
is required by the irreducibility of the string diagram since the anti-symmetric part
of the fermionic bilinear produces a scalar ﬁeld φ[AB] and consequently a factorisation
channel.

The relevant disk amplitude can be written as

AN S−N S

µ2,ξ(φ) =Z dz4hc(z1) c(z2) c(z3)i(cid:10)V¯µ(z1) Vµ(z2) W (z3, z4) Vξ(φ)(cid:11)

To evaluate the correlator one can consider a speciﬁc component and then use
SO(6) invariance to reconstruct its covariant form. For instance, if we take A =
B = 1
2(+ + +), the open string condensate contributes a net charge +2 along the
ﬁrst three complex directions, so that only the ψ:ψψ: term can contribute to the
correlator. The relevant correlators are

the harmonic function K3 describes a particular component of the fermion bilinear
condensates connecting two branes parallel along the (y3, ˜y3)-plane. Similarly K1,2
represents fermion bilinear condensates connecting branes parallel along the 1 and 2
planes (tori).

We conclude by noticing that other choices for the 2-charge condensate give rise
to solutions that do not belong to the ‘eight-ful’ harmonic family (2.5). In particular,
taking non-zero values of vty3 ˜y3, vty3i or vt˜y3i give rise to solutions with non-trivial
bij, g˜y3t or by3t components, respectively. These components can be matched against
a more general 2-charge solution obtained from [6] after two T-dualities. We refer
the reader to [7] for a detailed match of these components in the T-dual D1-D5
description.

to

5.1 NS-NS amplitude

We consider now string amplitudes on a disk with boundary on all four types of
D3-branes. In particular we consider the insertions of four fermions µa starting on
a D3-brane of type (a) and ending on a D3-branes of type (a + 1) with a = 0, 1, 2, 3
(mod 4), in a cyclic order. We notice that unlike the case of two boundaries now
the condensate is complex6. The charge conjugate condensate can be deﬁned by
replacing each µa with its charge conjugate ﬁeld ¯µa and running along the boundary
of the disk with the same cyclic order but in reversed sense. The real and imaginary
parts of the string amplitude can be selected by turning on the real and imaginary
parts of the condensate respectively.

We consider the following NS-NS amplitude

µ4,ξ(φ) = hc(z1) c(z2) c(z4)iZ dz3dz5dz6

ducibility of the string diagram. As a result Oαβ ˙α ˙β transforms in the (3, 3) of the
SU(2)L × SU(2)R Lorentz group and can be better viewed as a symmetric and
traceless tensor vµν. We notice that even though the presence of the four diﬀerent

comes together with its charge conjugate ¯µa, the overall conﬁguration preserves only N = 1 SUSY
(1/8 BPS) and fermions connecting all four type of D3 brane form two pairs of opposite chirality.

– 17 –

D3-branes breaks the Lorentz symmetry down to SO(4), the string amplitude is
invariant under SO(4) × U(1)3 since the U(1)3 rotations of the three internal tori
do not change the relative angles between branes. We notice also that space-time
chirality determines the internal U(1)3 charges of the twisted fermions. In particular
µα
1 and ¯µ ˙α
4 have
opposite charges with respect to the third internal U(1). Therefore the open string
condensate vµν carries no U(1)3 charges.

To evaluate the correlator we specialize to α = β = 1

2(−+).
Only the four fermion piece of the closed string vertex can compensate for the net +2
charge of the open string condensate and two of these fermions have to be taken along
the ﬁfth plane. In addition since the net internal U(1)3 charge of the condensate is
zero, the only choices for the ψM ψN fermions in the closed string vertex are (M, N) =
(I, ¯I) with I = 1, 2, 3, 4

Noticing that real and imaginary parts of the amplitude contribute to symmetric
(ER)(M N ) and antisymmetric parts (ER)[M N ] we conclude that a purely imaginary

branes along the disk. These condensates lead again to solutions of type M but
with internal coordinates that are permuted among one another. On the other hand,
turning on the real part of the condensate (5.6) will produce solutions with a non-

it as an open question to establish whether or not an extended family of supergravity
solution accounting for these brane excitations can be explicitly written.

that ΨM
Σ (k) = :kψψM CΣ: is a world-sheet primary ﬁeld of dimension 13/8, belonging
to the 128 of SO(1, 9), with CΣ the spin ﬁeld of negative chirality. Again taking
α = β = 1
2 (−+), it is easy to see that the net charge −2 of
the condensate can be only compensated by the kψψM term in the closed string
vertex with SΛ and CΣ both carrying charge − 1
2 along the ﬁfth direction. This
leads to eight choices for SΛ. On the other hand, once SΛ is chosen, the charges of
ΨM
Σ (k) = :kψψM CΣ: are completely determined by charge conservation. For example,

Since I2, I4 are real and I1,I3 purely imaginary, a purely imaginary condensate

selects the I1, I3 and ¯I1, ¯I3 components.

The resulting string amplitude can then be written as

6. Conclusions and outlook

We have provided a direct link between open string condensates and a large class
of micro-state geometries associated to four-dimensional BPS black holes consisting
of D3-branes intersecting on T 6. For speciﬁc choices of the condensates, we match
the order gs of the micro-state solutions (2.5) against disk amplitudes involving a
NS-NS or R-R closed string state and zero, two or four twisted open string fermions
besides an arbitrary number of untwisted scalars. Each mixed disk is associated
to a harmonic function that for the class of supergravity solutions under consid-
eration here can be written as a linear combination of eight harmonic functions
Ha = {LI, V, KI, M}. The eight functions describe the distribution of single, 2- and
4-intersections in the R3 non compact space directions.

The M class of micro-states is particularly interesting since the number of disks
with four diﬀerent boundaries grows with the product of the four charges N =
Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4. In a ﬁrst approximation, the function M can then be viewed as an N-
center harmonic function with moduli space spanned by the N positions on R3 up to
SN -permutations. One may then expect that the number of micro-states in this class
grows as e2π√N/6, the number of conjugacy classes of SN or equivalently the partitions

of N, at large N. This suggests that the 4-charge micro-states identiﬁed in this work
may account for a large fraction of the states contributing to the (putative) black
hole entropy. A quantitative study of this issue remains one of the most challenging
and exciting questions left open by our work.

Although we have worked mostly with D3-branes that are either parallel (along
some directions) or perpendicular (along other directions), our analysis can easily be
adapted to branes intersecting at arbitrary angles and preserving the same amount of
supersymmetry (1/8 of the original 32 super-charges) [32, 33] or branes intersecting
in orbifolds [34, 35]. The open strings living at the intersections will be described in
terms of twist-ﬁelds [36, 37, 38] that generalise the Z2 twist ﬁelds that appeared in
the present analysis. We have explicitly checked that one-, two- and four- open string
insertions source for classical supergravity proﬁles similar to those obtained in this
paper. We defer a detailed analysis to future work. For the time being we would like
to stress that oﬀ-diagonal components of the internal metric can mimic the eﬀect of
tilting the branes thus changing their intersection angles. Furthermore, it is amusing
to observe that the 5 harmonic functions that appear in the static solutions found in
[32, 33, 34, 35] can be identiﬁed with V, LI and M. This is consistent with the fact
that setting KI = 0 produces micro-state geometries with no angular momentum.

Our solution generating technique have useful physical applications, both for
understanding the physics of multi-center extremal solutions and for constructing
new smooth micro-states geometries for under-rotating extremal black holes in four
and higher dimensions. Indeed, in addition to reproducing all known supergravity
solutions in the ‘eightful’ harmonic family for certain choices of the condensates, we

– 22 –

have shown that other choices are possible that can generate new 4-charge micro-state
geometries beyond the ones available in the literature.

B.1 D0-D2-D4-D6 solution

A family of under-rotating multi-center black hole solutions corresponding to a gen-
eral system of D0-D2-D4-D6 branes in type IIA theory wrapped on T 6 was con-
structed in [21, 23]. The solutions are parametrised by eight harmonic functions
(a = 1, . . . 8, I = 1, 2, 3)

We stress that the inclusion of C5 and C7 is required in order to get a self-dual ﬁve-
form ﬁeld F5 = dC4 after T-dualities. Only after the inclusion of these terms, the
Buscher’s rules map solutions of type IIA to solutions of IIB and viceversa.

B.2 D34-solution

The D0-D2-D4-D6 system can be mapped to a system of solely D3-branes apply-
ing three T-dualities along ˜y1, ˜y2 and ˜y3. T-duality mixes the supergravity ﬁelds
according to the generalised Buscher rules [5]:

where by z we denote the direction along with T-duality is performed and the metric
is understood in the string frame. Applying this rules one ﬁnds that after T-dualities
along ˜y1, ˜y2 and ˜y3 the dilaton and the B-ﬁeld becomes trivial while the metric maps
to

Now let us consider the RR ﬁelds.
It is easy to see that the two terms involving
the metric g in the T-duality transformations of RR ﬁelds in (B.8) do not contribute
to the metric (B.9). More precisely, the term proportional to C (n−1)
[m1...mn−2|z B|mn−1|z
cancels because C and B always share two indices while the term proportional to
C (n−1)
[m1...mn−2|z gz|mn−1] cancels because the original metric is always diagonal along the
two-torus along one of whose two coordinates the following T-duality transformation
is performed. As a result, the T-duality transformations can be written in the simple
form

where we decompose the R-R forms

′(n) = C (n−1)

into a components containing or not the direction d˜yI along which the T-duality is
performed. After T-dualities along ˜y1, ˜y2 and ˜y3, one ﬁnds that all RR ﬁelds are
mapped to the four-form C4 that can be written in the form

C4 = α0 ∧ ˜e1 ∧ ˜e2 ∧ ˜e3 + 1

2ǫIJK αI ∧ dyI ∧ ˜eJ ∧ ˜eK

+ β0 ∧ dy1 ∧ dy2 ∧ dy3 + 1

2 ǫIJK βI ∧ ˜eI ∧ dyJ ∧ dyK

One can check that the ﬁve form ﬂux

obtained from (B.13) is self-dual as required.
