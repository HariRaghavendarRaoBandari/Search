ABSTRACT
We present 8.5(cid:48)(cid:48) resolution 1.1mm continuum imaging and CO spectroscopic redshift mea-
surements of eight extremely bright submillimetre galaxies identiﬁed from the Planck and
Herschel surveys, taken with the Large Millimeter Telescope’s AzTEC and Redshift Search
Receiver instruments. We compiled a candidate list of high redshift galaxies by cross-
correlating the Planck Surveyor mission’s highest frequency channel (857 GHz, FWHM =
4.5(cid:48)) with the archival Herschel Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE) imag-
ing data, and requiring the presence of a unique, single Herschel counterpart within the 150(cid:48)(cid:48)
search radius of the Planck source positions with 350 µm ﬂux density larger than 100 mJy,
excluding known blazars and foreground galaxies. All eight candidate objects observed are
detected in 1.1mm continuum by AzTEC bolometer camera, and at least one CO line is de-
tected in all cases with a spectroscopic redshift between 1.3 < zCO < 3.3. Their infrared
spectral energy distributions mapped using the Herschel and AzTEC photometry are con-
sistent with cold dust emission with characteristic temperature between Td = 43 K and 84
K. With apparent infrared luminosity of up to LIR = 3 × 1014µ−1L(cid:12), they are some of
the most luminous galaxies ever found (with yet unknown gravitational magniﬁcation factor
µ). The analysis of their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) suggests that star formation is
powering the bulk of their extremely large IR luminosities. Derived molecular gas masses of
MH2 = (0.6 − 7.8) × 1011M(cid:12) (for µ ≈ 10) also make them some of the most gas-rich high
redshift galaxies ever detected.

INTRODUCTION

Submillimetre bright galaxies (“SMGs” hereafter) have emerged
as an important component in our understanding of the evolution
of galaxy formation in dusty, high-mass, starburst systems (see
the reviews by Blain et al. 2002; Casey et al. 2014). Studies of
SMGs capture the dust enshrouded young stars and the supernovae
remnants of massive early type OB stars within the cores of Gi-
ant Molecular Clouds (GMCs), revealing the nature of stellar as-
sembly in the early universe through sub-mm through radio obser-
vations of thermal emission and molecular emission lines. SMG
studies contribute to comprehensive multi-wavelength analyses of

c(cid:13) 2016 RAS

growth and evolution of some of the earliest forming galaxies emit-
ting in the rest-frame IR (see Blain et al. 2002, and references
therein). The epoch of massive galaxy formation and growth en-
compasses a rich period (1 < z < 3.5) of star formation, whereby
parsec–to–kiloparsec scale GMCs are changing their distribution
in the galaxy throughout various stages of merging, gas accretion
and star formation. This epoch consists of active star formation
rates that are particularly bright in the infrared to sub-millimeter
ranges. The Planck mission’s all-sky survey (Planck Collaboration
I 2014) has proven to be useful in detecting highly luminous galax-
ies (LIR > 1012−14L(cid:12)) over a wide range of redshift (Ca˜nameras
et al. 2015; Planck Collaboration XXVII 2015; Planck Collab-

2

K. C. Harrington et al.

oration XXXIX 2016). The Planck Collaboration predicted that
Planck’s detectors would be sensitive to nearby galaxies as well as
extremely high redshift galaxies, including SMGs that exhibit ther-
mal dust emission reaching upwards to 100% in the far-infrared
(FIR; see Efstathiou et al. 2000; Johnson et al. 2013). The high
redshift SMGs have a local analog in the ultra-luminous infrared
galaxies (ULIRGs). An intended cross-correlation between Her-
schel and Planck’s highest frequency channels has been acutely
beneﬁcial in discovering some of the most luminous IR galaxies,
and recent Herschel observations using SPIRE instrument have re-
vealed extremely luminous dusty star forming galaxies emitting in
the IR (e.g., Casey et al. 2012, 2014; Heinis et al. 2013; Ivison et al.
2013). Covering the wavelengths up to 350 µm, the Planck survey
is adept at detecting these highly luminous point sources across the
entire sky; and, it is the ﬁrst all-sky survey with the required sen-
sitivity to systematically identify the most luminous sources in the
Universe.

One of the key attributes that makes submillimetre surveys
such as by Planck particularly powerful is the negative k-correction
in the Rayleigh-Jeans (RJ) part of the thermal dust emission that
uniquely allows a nearly distance-independent study of high red-
shift dusty IR sources as the relative ﬂux density observed in the
submillimetre wavelengths (200-1000 µm) is unaffected by red-
shift out to z (cid:62) 10 (Blain 1998). This provides us with a remark-
able ability to identify and investigate the frequency and the overall
importance of these dusty starburst galaxies throughout the cos-
mic history of galaxy assembly. Within the past decade it has also
become possible to detect the CO emission lines from these galax-
ies using ground-based telescopes and interferometers such as the
Large Millimeter Telescope Alfonso Serrano (LMT), the Jansky
Very Large Array (JVLA), and the Atacama Large Millimeter Ar-
ray (ALMA). In addition to yielding secure spectroscopic redshifts
for these optically faint population (e.g., Yun et al. 2012, 2015;
Zavala et al. 2015), sensitive observations of CO emission in these
galaxies can provide critical information on the total cold gas con-
tents and their relation to the stellar and dark matter masses of the
host galaxies and spatial distribution and dynamics of the ongoing
star formation activities.
Given the large beam size (θ (cid:62) 5(cid:48)) and the high confusion
noise (>100 mJy in the 857 GHz band), Planck-identiﬁed high red-
shift sources are likely exceptional objects, either strongly lensed
(Ca˜nameras et al. 2015; Geach et al. 2015) or highly clustered (Ne-
grello et al. 2005; Fu et al. 2012; Clements et al. 2014). Obser-
vational data on strongly lensed objects usually require a detailed
lensing model, requiring additional work to interpret the results. On
the other hand, the magnifying property of a gravitational lens can
reveal structural details of gas and star formation down to scales of
10 to 100 parsec, well beyond the reach of even ALMA or JVLA
(e.g., Yun et al. 2007; Swinbank et al. 2011; Tamura et al. 2015).
Lensing can also allow us to probe an intrinsically much fainter
population (Knudsen et al. 2008, 2009; Dessauges-Zavadsky et al.
2015). One key motivation for this study is to identify strongly
lensed SMGs from the Planck survey in order to exploit grav-
itational lensing and to probe physical details of star formation
and gas properties that are not accessible through the conventional
means.

Here, we present our identiﬁcation of eight extremely lumi-
nous infrared galaxies successfully identiﬁed as intrinsically bright
and likely lensed sources through a cross-correlation analysis be-
tween the archival Planck and Herschel database. This is a pilot
study for a larger program to identify a large sample of extremely
luminous high redshift SMGs identiﬁed by the Planck survey. In

§ 2 we discuss our selection methods for the gravitationally lensed
SMG candidate sources. In § 3 we will discuss our observations
of these Planck-Herschel sources using the LMT and it’s two in-
struments: Redshift Search Receiver (RSR) and AzTEC. In § 4
we present spectral energy distribution analysis of all of the tar-
get sources, and the detailed discussions of individual sources are
summarized in § 5. Finally, the nature of these Planck-Herschel
sources are discussed in the context of the gas and dust properties
derived from the new LMT observations in § 6. We adopt a ΛCDM
cosmology with H0 = 70 km s−1 Mpc−1 with Ωm = 0.3, and
ΩΛ = 0.7 throughout this paper.

2 IDENTIFICATION OF BRIGHT Planck-Herschel SMG

CANDIDATES

Our candidate Planck SMGs were selected primarily by cross-
correlating the Planck Catalog of Compact Sources (PCCS), a
dataset including roughly 24,000 point source objects (Planck Col-
laboration XXVIII 2014), with the combined catalogs of three
Herschel large area surveys: Herschel Multi-tiered Extragalactic
Survey (HerMES, Oliver et al. 2012), Herschel Stripe 82 Survey
(HerS-82, Viero et al. 2014), and Herschel DDT “Must-Do” Pro-
grammes. These Herschel source catalogs were generated using
the public domain pipeline data products obtained from the Her-
schel Science Archive (HSA)1. We limited our searches only to the
PCCS sources at Galactic latitude |b| > 30◦ in order to minimize
the Galactic source contamination.
To begin, we identiﬁed all Herschel catalog sources located
with a 150(cid:48)(cid:48) search radius (approximately the beam size of the
Planck 857 GHz band) of every PCCS source catalog position.
Low redshift galaxies can be eliminated using the SPIRE colour
(see Wardlow et al. 2013). Negrello et al. (2010) and Wardlow et
al. have reported a high efﬁciency (100% and 70%, respectively) of
identifying lensed high redshift IR galaxy using S500µ > 100 mJy
as a selection criteria. We adopt S350µ (cid:62) 100 mJy as our selection
method for the best candidate Herschel counterpart since our sam-
ple selection relies mostly on the Planck 857 GHz (350 µm) band
detection. All counterparts identiﬁed with known blazars are also
removed (see below). As seen in Figure 1, our ﬁnal selected Her-
schel counterpart candidates lie within about 50(cid:48)(cid:48) (1σ) of the Planck
source position. The presence of a point source with this ﬂux den-
sity indicates a rare and truly luminous and dusty source given the
thermal dust emission seen in typical spectral energy distribution
models (LIR = 1.3 × 1013L(cid:12) for a S300µ = 100 mJy source at
z = 2; e.g., Efstathiou et al. 2000; Casey et al. 2012). Through
examining the models for the expected spectral energy distribution,
sources peaking at 350 µm reveal a galaxy/galaxies at a high red-
shift (1 < z < 4), whereby the UV-heated dust is redshifted from
the infrared and strongly observed in the submillimetre to millime-
tre wavelengths. One good indicator of a high redshift luminous
dusty galaxy is the characteristic ﬂat spectral energy distribution in
the submillimetre regime of the spectrum, with the dust peak oc-
curring within the Herschel 250, 350, and 500 µm band. We note
that the Planck 350 µm ﬂux density is in some cases signiﬁcantly
larger than the Herschel 350 µm ﬂux (see Table 3), partly because
Planck confusion noise is high.

Given the large Planck beam size, we use the positions of the
Herschel SPIRE 350 µm counterpart for identifying counterparts in

of any bright optical counterparts in the SDSS or POSS-II plate im-
ages. One of which is found in the Akari Deep Field, with a ﬂux
density greater than 300 mJy in the SPIRE 350 µm band. Because
of its declination being out of reach for the LMT, this source is ex-
cluded from our follow up investigation. The last remaining source
has been identiﬁed as a rediscovery of MIPS J142824.0+352619
(z = 1.325), also identiﬁed by Wardlow et al. (2013) as a gravi-
tationally lensed candidate. Further information on this source is
found in § 5. We note that Clements et al. (2014) found proto-
cluster candidates in the same ﬁelds by cross-correlating the PCCS
with the Herschel catalogues.

2.2 PCCS 857 GHz and Herschel-Stripe 82 Survey

Viero et al. (2014) released Herschel band-merged catalog of
27,257 point sources in the HerS-82 survey. Covering 79 deg2, this
is another major Herschel wide area survey. It had been predicted
by Viero et al. that the HerS-82 survey has the ability to detect
roughly 100 IR galaxies at high redshift (i.e. LIR > 1012L(cid:12) at
z (cid:62) 2). There are 42 Herschel catalog matches to 16 Planck can-
didate sources found in this survey area, and on average there are
2 to 3 Herschel sources found within our 2.5(cid:48) search radius. Of
these original 16 Planck sources we discover 7 objects with a Her-
schel counterpart with S350µ (cid:62) 100 mJy. Of these 7 sources, Her-
schel data show that two are bright, low-z galaxies: CGCG 385-062
(z = 0.047 with S350µ > 450 mJy) and NGC 585 (z = 0.018 with
S350µ > 300 mJy). One well-known ﬂat spectrum radio quasar,
LBQS 0106+0119 (z = 2.099), is also rediscovered with its red
SPIRE colour. The four remaining sources are included in our list
of high redshift SMG candidates. One of these sources has no NED
match, and two are associated with a faint SDSS source, while
the ﬁnal source is associated with a 2MASS source. Because of
scheduling restrictions, we were able to conduct follow-up obser-
vations for only one (PJ020941.3) of these sources using the LMT,
and only this source is considered part of our Planck sample pre-
sented in this study.

2.3 PCCS 857 GHz and Herschel DDT “Must-Do” Survey

The Herschel DDT “Must-Do” Survey2 is a targeted imaging sur-
vey of 199 PCCS sources using the Herschel-SPIRE instrument,
designed to investigate the nature of these Planck sources. We iden-
tify a total of 75 Herschel sources matched to 21 Planck sources
meeting our selection criteria. On average there are 3 to 4 Herschel
sources within the search area for each of the Planck sources, and
we identiﬁed a total of 13 Herschel sources with S350µ > 100
mJy. We further excluded six well-known Quasi-Stellar Objects
(QSOs) whose submillimetre emission is not associated with dust:
PKS 2252-282, PKS 0402-362, ESO 362-G021, PKS 0537-441,
3C 279, and PKS 1335-127. One Planck source is the Herschel re-
solved bright, low-z galaxy, NGC 5777 (z = 0.007 with S350µ >
650 mJy). The remaining six Planck-Herschel counterparts are in-
cluded in our selection of targets likely to be high redshift SMGs.
Unknown to us initially, the Planck instrument team has its
own program to identify and study high redshift galaxies in their
survey, and this Herschel DDT “Must-Do” Survey is apparently
part of their effort to verify the candidate high redshift Planck
sources using higher resolution images (Ca˜nameras et al. 2015).

other wavelengths. We exclude radio-loud AGNs and bright, late-
type foreground galaxies (z < 1) by ﬁrst examining a 30(cid:48)(cid:48) search
radius using NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED) and the
all-sky point source catalog from the Wide Field Infrared Sur-
vey Explorer (WISE), the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS; Con-
don et al. 1998), and Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-
Centimeters (FIRST; Becker et al. 1995; White et al. 1997). We
obtained images of the majority of our sources using the Sloan Dig-
ital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Second Palomar Observatory Sky
Survey (POSS-II) database to look for any possible low redshift
foreground galaxies missed by other methods, and extremely faint
optical counterparts are also identiﬁed in some cases. We use WISE
photometry to examine the apparent brightness of these sources in
the 3.4, 4.6, 11, and 22 µm bands (see Table 5). If a source exhibits
a strong detection in the 11 µm and 22 µm channels, a possibility
of a power-law AGN is further explored.

2.1 PCCS 857 GHz and HerMES

The HerMES (Oliver et al. 2012) is one of the large Herschel cos-
mology surveys spanning a total of 94.8 deg2 in combined area. We
constructed a master catalog of 139,270 sources from the SPIRE
photometry taken from 9 independent ﬁelds. Overall there are 19
Planck point sources falling within these survey areas, and 250
matched Herschel sources are identiﬁed with them. For each of the
19 Planck sources there are on average 13 Herschel sources found
within our 2.5(cid:48) search radius. We identiﬁed 15 of these Planck ob-
jects having at least one Herschel SPIRE detection with a 350 µm
ﬂux density at or greater than 100 mJy.

Using NED we found that 13 of the Planck candidate sources
with a bright Herschel counterpart are associated with low redshift
galaxies or galaxy pairs. The remaining two Planck candidates are
likely to be luminous high redshift sources due to their exceedingly
high ﬂux, ﬂat SED across the three SPIRE bands, and the absence

our sample. Detailed comparisons of individual objects are given
in § 5.

3 LMT OBSERVATIONS

Here we present our observations of the bright Planck-Herschel
sources using the LMT (Hughes et al. 2010) atop the 15,000 ft high
Volcan Sierra Negra in Puebla, Mexico. During the Early Science
(ES) campaign when our observations were taken, the LMT was
operating with a primary reﬂector consisting of 3 rings of fully
functioning active surface system, totaling 32.5-m in diameter. Two
facility instruments were available: the Redshift Search Receiver (a
broadband spectrometer system covering 72-111 GHz with a 38
GHz in total bandwidth, Erickson et al. 2007) and AzTEC (1.1mm
imaging camera with 144 pixels, Wilson et al. 2008). All eight
Planck-Herschel sources presented here are observed with both in-
struments.

3.1 Redshift Search Receiver Measurements

Our observations include redshift measurements taken with the
Redshift Search Receiver operating in the frequency window of 73–
111 GHz, with 4 detector pixels organized in a dual–beam, dual–
polarization conﬁguration. The RSR beam-switches at 1 kHz be-
tween the two beams separated by 78(cid:48)(cid:48) in Azimuth direction on
the sky, providing a stable baseline. The backend receiver consists
of an auto-correlator system that covers a total of 38 GHz spec-
tral bandwidth simultaneously with a spectral resolution of 31.25
MHz. Table 1 provides information of the integration time for each
source. For the majority of the sources a CO line was evident within
15 minutes of integration, and only 3 of our sources needed a longer
integration to yield a CO detection with a S/N ratio (cid:62) 4.

The measured RSR spectra of all eight observed sources cov-
ering the entire redshift range are shown in Figure 2, and the mea-
sured and derived CO line quantities are summarized in Table 2.

As discussed in detail by Yun et al. (2015), two or more CO transi-
tions fall within the RSR spectral band at z (cid:62) 3.15, and a unique
redshift for the CO source can be determined from the RSR spec-
trum alone (as is the case for the z = 3.256 source PJ160917.8).
If only one CO line is detected as in the seven out of eight cases
shown in Fig. 2, additional information is required to determine
the exact redshift. We derive a unique redshift for all eight Planck-
Herschel sources observed using their panchromatic photometric
redshift support as discussed in Appendix A.

The zoom-in view of the individual CO lines in Figure 3
clearly shows that all of the CO lines are fully resolved by the
RSR, some with the characteristic “top hat” proﬁle commonly seen
for CO lines in rotationally supported galaxies, while others show
an asymmetric proﬁle of a more complex kinematics, perhaps re-
sulting from differential lensing. The measured line widths ∆V ,
corrected for the instrumental resolution (see appendix), ranges be-
tween 372 and 652 km s−1. For the ﬁve sources in common with
Ca˜nameras et al. (2015), the measured line widths and line integrals
agree well with theirs, with the median ratios of 1.1 and 0.81, re-
spectively, except for PJ105353.0 (our line width and line ﬂux are
factors of 1.6 and 1.9 larger).

The CO line luminosity, L(cid:48)

CO, is computed for each observed

with SCO∆V in Jy km s−1, νobs in GHz, and DL in Mpc.
The molecular gas mass MH2 is derived ﬁrst by converting these
line luminosities to L(cid:48)
CO(1−0) using the average “SMG” ratios
of L(cid:48)
CO(1−0) = 0.85, L(cid:48)
CO(1−0) = 0.66,
and L(cid:48)
CO(1−0) = 0.46 (Carilli & Walter 2013) and
then applying the standard CO-to-H2 conversion factor of αCO =
4.3 M(cid:12) [K km s−1 pc2]−1 (Bolatto et al. 2013). As discussed in
detail by Bolatto et al. in their review article, this conversion from
L(cid:48)
CO(1−0) to MH2 can vary by a factor of up to 5 or more, de-
pending on metallicity, excitation, and dynamical state of the gas.
However, there are no compelling reasons to believe any of these
concerns are important for these Planck-Herschel or other high red-
shift sources (see the detailed discussions by Scoville et al. 2015),
and we adopt the standard Galactic conversion factor. The derived
molecular gas masses MH2 = (5.5 − 78) × 1011µ−1M(cid:12) (uncor-
rected for an unknown magniﬁcation factor µ) are extremely large
and make these Planck-Herschel sources some of the most lumi-
nous CO emitters ever detected – see Figure 9 by Carilli & Walter
(2013) for a comparison. One of these sources, PJ020941.3, is al-
ready shown to be a strongly lensed object with a magniﬁcation
of µ ≈ 13 (Geach et al. 2015), yielding the intrinsic gas mass of
2.0 ± 0.1 × 1011M(cid:12). Even if they are all strongly magniﬁed with
µ ∼ 10, their gas masses corrected for lensing are still comparable
to some of the most gas-rich SMGs ever studied.

3.2 AzTEC Measurements

Continuum observations were made with the AzTEC camera (Wil-
son et al. 2008), a 1.1mm continuum camera that is a facility in-
strument on the LMT between March 21 and May 18 of 2014.
Only the inner 32-m diameter area of the LMT’s primary mirror
was illuminated during these Early Science observations, leading
to a beam diameter (FWHM) of 8.5(cid:48)(cid:48). The telescope executed a
modiﬁed Lissajous pattern in order to modulate the telescope bore-
sight on the sky. This pattern is described in Wilson et al. (2008)
though the pattern parameters were adjusted for the LMT to pro-
vide a fully-sampled 1.5(cid:48) area of sky with near-uniform coverage.

Figure 2. The RSR spectra of the eight Planck-Herschel sources. For the two sources that are detected with S/N ∼ 5 (PJ142823.9 & PJ160722.6), the
location of the CO line is shown with an arrow to guide the eye. A more detailed zoom-in view is shown in Fig. 3.

For each source, the pattern was centered on the location of the
Herschel source coordinates matched to the low resolution Planck
point source detections. The observations were made over a wide
range of atmospheric conditions with 225 GHz opacities ranging
from τ225 = 0.09 to 0.3. On-source integration times varied from
3-40 minutes depending on the quality of the detection as measured
in real time. Pointing corrections were applied for each observation
based on pointing measurements of nearby radio quasars made im-
mediately prior to or immediately following the science observa-
tion. The measured pointing corrections with respect to the nomi-
nal LMT pointing model were 1 − 4(cid:48)(cid:48) in azimuth and 9 − 20(cid:48)(cid:48)in
elevation.

AzTEC observations were calibrated using a set of 106 beam-
maps of bright radio quasars and asteroids made during the full
observing season. The full set of maps were used to measure the
elevation-dependent gain of the telescope. For these observations
a correction as large as a factor of 1.4 in gain was required for
the lowest-elevation observations. The resulting ﬂux uncertainty, as
measured by a concurrent monitoring program is 10 per cent. We
note that, starting from the fall of 2014, the removal of an astigma-
tism term from the primary mirror using the active surface system
resulted in a ﬂat gain curve for the entire elevation range.

The data for each source was reduced using the AzTEC Stan-
dard Pipeline described in detail in Wilson et al. (2008) and Scott
et al. (2008). Since we are nominally searching for point sources,
we use the standard Wiener ﬁltering technique described in Per-

c(cid:13) 2016 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–??

era et al. (2008). The pipeline produces a ﬁltered signal map (in
Jy/beam), a ﬁltered weight map (in beam2/Jy2), and a ﬁltered point
spread function. Because of the Wiener ﬁlter, the ﬂux of any de-
tected point source may be read directly from the peak-ﬂux pixel
near the center of the source. A typical noise in the AzTEC images
is σ ∼ 1.5− 4 mJy, and our target sources are detected with S/N =
4-20 (see Fig. 4). These values are reported in Table 3, with a min-
imum measurement uncertainty of 10 per cent for sources detected
with S/N > 10.

4 SPECTRAL ENERGY DISTRIBUTION ANALYSIS OF

THE Planck-Herschel SOURCES

4.1 Modiﬁed Blackbody Model

We explore constraints on the infrared luminosity and attempt to
characterize the dust emission for these systems by analyzing their
SEDs using a modiﬁed blackbody model. We adopt the functional
form based on the derivation by Yun & Carilli (2002) for the mod-
iﬁed blackbody model. A detailed accounting of our method is
outlined in Appendix C. As summarized in Table 4, the charac-
teristic dust temperature Td and IR luminosity, derived primarily
from the three Herschel SPIRE band photometric measurements
(250, 350, and 500 µm) and the AzTEC 1100 µm continuum
measurements (see Table 3), range between 43-84 K and LIR =
(1−28)×1013µ−1L(cid:12). There is a good constraint on most sources

(see Fig. C1), although dust temperature is not constrained well for
some of our sources. The best ﬁt models are also shown in solid
magenta lines in Figure 5, suggesting that the wavelength coverage
of our photometric data is not sufﬁcient to fully probe their dust
SED in some cases. The star formation rates in Table 4 are calcu-
lated using the empirical calibration by Kennicutt (1998), corrected
for the Kroupa IMF [i.e., SF R = LIR/(9.4 × 109L(cid:12)) M(cid:12)/yr].

4.2 Template SED Analysis

In addition to their Herschel SPIRE and AzTEC photometry that
trace the peak of the dust SED, all eight Planck-Herschel sources
are clearly detected in a wide range of wavelength bands, from op-
tical to radio as shown in Figures 6 & 7 (also see Table 5). By
analysing these SEDs using model templates, it may be possible to
gain additional insights into the nature of their extreme luminosity.
In particular, we compare the observed SEDs with the model SEDs
of young stellar clusters embedded in a giant molecular cloud and
evolved by different amounts of time by Efstathiou et al. (2000)
in Figure 5. Since the discrete SED templates available cannot be
tuned for a particular object, especially in the UV, optical, and near-
IR where source and dust geometry can lead to a large dispersion,
we only ﬁt the long wavelength data at λ (cid:62) 70 µm. The good
agreement between the data and the models suggests that intense
star formation activities can account for most of the observed prop-
erties in nearly all cases. The radio to millimeter wavelengths part
of the SED is constructed using the well established radio-IR cor-
relation for star forming galaxies as described by Yun & Carilli
(2002), and the observed 1.4 GHz radio emission is also consistent
with the radio and IR luminosity being powered by a pure starburst

tion of AzTEC on LMT and are mostly centered on the peak of the Her-
schel 350 µm image shown in contours (increments of 100 mJy, except for
PJ160722.6, which is in increment of 50 mJy).

best ﬁt dusty starburst SEDs with different starburst ages by Efstathiou et al. (2000) at the ﬁxed CO redshifts (see Table 2). Modiﬁed blackbody models ﬁtting
only the Herschel and AzTEC photometry are shown in thick magenta lines. In all cases, the new AzTEC 1100 µm points are shown as ﬁlled circles probe the
RJ portion of the dust spectra. An elliptical galaxy SED template by Polletta et al. (2007) covering the optical wavelength bands is also shown using a black
dashed line for the four sources with an obvious foreground galaxy in the SDSS plates.

in nearly all cases – see additional discussions on the nature of the
powering source in § 6.1.2.

Using the best ﬁt SED models shown in Figure 5, we compute
the template based IR luminosity (LIR,SB) between 8-1000 µm
and star formation rate SF RSB for each Planck-Herschel source
(see Table 4). The IR luminosity derived from the best ﬁt template
SED ranges between (1.4− 29)× 1013µ−1L(cid:12), in good agreement
with the estimates from the modiﬁed blackbody model calculation
discussed above (§ 4.1). This is not surprising given that the Her-
schel SPIRE photometry points constrain the bulk of the luminosity
in both models.

A signiﬁcant deviation from the Efstathiou templates is seen
in the rest frame optical portion of the SEDs in at least four cases.
A subset of these sources are already known to be lensed by a fore-
ground galaxy (see § 5 and Ca˜nameras et al. 2015), and the pres-
ence of one or more foreground lensing galaxy along the same line
of sight is naturally expected. Indeed, for PJ020941.3, PJ132302.8,
PJ160722.6, and PJ160917.8, an addition of an elliptical galaxy
SED by Polletta et al. (2007) nicely accounts for the excess ﬂux in
the rest frame optical bands, as shown in Figure 5. This photomet-
ric evidence for a foreground lensing galaxy is further discussed
below for individual objects (see § 5).

5 ANALYSIS OF INDIVIDUAL SOURCES
5.1 PJ020941.3

PJ020941.3 is a Planck source found in the Herschel-Stripe 82
Survey ﬁeld and is associated with the z = 0.202 galaxy
SDSS J020941.27+001558.5. Our photometric redshift analysis

c(cid:13) 2016 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–??

predicts a lensed, dusty starburst galaxy at z ≈ 2.5 with the
dust peak near 350 µm with S350µ = 897 ± 89 mJy. We de-
tect 1100 µm continuum emission easily using AzTEC, measuring
S1100µ = 147 ± 20 mJy, centered on the Herschel source posi-
tion (see Fig. 4). Using the RSR we detected CO (3-2) line at 97.31
GHz, yielding a redshift of z = 2.5536 ± 0.0002 (a single line
redshift resolved using the photometric redshift support as shown
in Fig. A1).

The nature of this source, also known as ‘9io9’ (Geach et al.
2015), is unique due to the fact that two unrelated research teams
have identiﬁed it entirely independently. Our initial selection of
PJ020941.3 arose from matching Planck’s 857 GHz position co-
ordinates to Herschel SPIRE observations in the HerS-82 survey
(see § 2.3). As we were ready to observe this source using the
LMT, a Director’s Discretionary Time request was made by an in-
dependent team based in the United Kingdom. The preliminary re-
sults from VISTA-CFHT Stripe 82 survey (Geach et al. in prep)
were combined to form multiple iJKs band images of potential
lens candidates. Tens of thousands of images were passed along to
the SPACEWARPS citizen science project (Marshal et al. in prep,
More et al. in prep), whereby this collaboration made its way to the
British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) Stargazing Live! broad-
cast from 7th January 2014 to 9th January 2014. Citizen scientists
were trained to identify the features reﬂective of gravitational lens-
ing, and the partial red Einstein ring of ’9io9’ was chosen as the best
lens candidate. Their follow-up spectroscopy yielded redshifted op-
tical emission lines at z = 2.553, and their lensing model con-
structed from near-infrared imaging data suggests a lensing magni-
ﬁcation of µ ≈ 10.

coverage range for FIRST and SDSS surveys, and we show instead the NVSS 1.4 GHz and 2MASS Ks band images.

5.2 PJ105353.0

One of Planck sources observed by the ”Must-Do” Herschel
SPIRE program, PJ105353.0, also known as the radio source
NVSS J105352+055623, is one of our brightest sources. It has a
350 µm ﬂux density of 996 ± 100 mJy, and it peaks in the 250 µm
band at 1028±103 mJy. This is the second brightest AzTEC source
we detected with S1100µ = 98± 10 mJy, well centered on the Her-
schel SPIRE 350 µm peak position (see Fig. 4). The bright line de-
tected by the RSR at 86.334 GHz (Fig. 2) is robustly identiﬁed as
CO (3–2) line by the photometric redshift support (see Fig. A1),
placing this object at z = 3.0053 ± 0.0003. No bright optical
source is seen on any of the SDSS images. Its ﬂat spectral energy
distribution in the SPIRE bands clearly indicates that this is indeed
a high redshift source, and its exceedingly high ﬂux is expected
to be a lensed thermal emission from a dusty background source.
The 1.4 GHz radio continuum reported by the NVSS, 6.5 ± 1.3
mJy, is slightly above what is expected from its far-IR emission
(see Fig. 5), and this “radio-excess” may be an indication of a radio
AGN (see Yun et al. 2001). Ca˜nameras et al. (2015) identify the sin-
gle line detected using the IRAM 30m telescope as CO (3–2) line
at “z = 3.0”, and their 2(cid:48)(cid:48)resolution 870 µm image obtained us-
ing the Submillimeter Array (SMA) shows a single source without
clear evidence for lensing.

5.3 PJ112714.5

PJ112714.5 is a Herschel “Must-Do” survey source and is one of
our brightest sources with a ﬂat SED across the Herschel SPIRE
channels, peaking in the 250 µm band. An AzTEC source with
S1100µ = 24 ± 2 mJy is detected coincident with the Herschel
source as seen in Fig. 4, and it has a red WISE mid-IR coun-
terpart with detections in all four bands. The observed SED sup-
ports the RSR detected line at 106.877 GHz to be CO (3-2) at a
z = 2.2357 ± 0.0002 (see Fig. A1). Ca˜nameras et al. (2015) iden-
c(cid:13) 2016 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–??

tify the single line they detected using the IRAM 30m telescope as
CO (3–2) line at “z = 2.2”. Their 2(cid:48)(cid:48)resolution 870 µm SMA im-
age shows a single, slightly extended source without a clear optical
counterpart, offset from a group of galaxies at z ≈ 0.3, suggesting
possible lensing by a galaxy group rather than by a single fore-
ground galaxy (e.g., George et al. 2013; Timmons et al. 2015). An
NVSS radio source with S1.4GHz = 31 mJy (see Fig. 6) is also
found just 18 (cid:48)(cid:48) away, suggesting a rather confused and busy fore-
ground environment.

5.4 PJ120207.6

PJ120207 is another Herschel “Must-Do” survey source and is
one of our brightest 350 µm peakers (S350µ = 646 mJy) with
LIR (cid:62) 1014L(cid:12). The observed SED is ﬂat across the 250 and
350 µm bands and drops slightly at 500 µm. An AzTEC source
with S1100µ = 69 ± 7 mJy is detected coincident with the Her-
schel source as seen in Fig. 4, and it has a red WISE mid-IR
counterpart with detections in all four bands. No optical galaxy is
found at the AzTEC position, but there is an SDSS source (SDSS
J120207.68+533432.5) located 6.8(cid:48)(cid:48) away from the AzTEC po-
sition, and this zph ≈ 0.43 galaxy is a possible lensing source
(Ca˜nameras et al. 2015). The RSR has detected a single line at an
observed frequency of 100.501 GHz, which we identify as CO (3–
2) line at z = 2.4417 ± 0.0002. Ca˜nameras et al. (2015) identify
the same line detected using the IRAM 30m telescope as CO (3–2)
line at “z = 2.4”. Their 2(cid:48)(cid:48)resolution 870 µm SMA image shows
two sources separated by about 4(cid:48)(cid:48), suggesting lensing by a fore-
ground galaxy. No radio counterpart is found for this object in the
VLA FIRST survey.

5.5 PJ132302.9

PJ132302 is a bright 350 µm source (S35mu = 590 mJy) with
LIR (cid:62) 1014L(cid:12), and the dust peak of this Herschel “Must-Do”
survey source occurs in the 250 µm band with S250µ = 652 mJy.
An AzTEC source with S1100µ = 33 ± 3 mJy is detected coin-
cident with the Herschel source as seen in Fig. 4, and it also has
a red WISE mid-IR counterpart with detections in all four bands
(see Fig. 7). The SDSS image shows a crowded ﬁeld with a cluster
of sources that are identiﬁed as “stars” by the SDSS database. The
nearest match to the WISE source is SDSS J132302.83+5535555.1,
which is consistent with a z = 0.48 galaxy when analysed together
with the WISE and 2MASS photometry (see Fig. 5), possibly rep-
resenting the foreground lensing galaxy. The RSR has detected a
single line at an observed frequency of 101.202 GHz, which we
identify as CO (3–2) line at z = 2.4167± 0.0004. Ca˜nameras et al.
(2015) identify the same line detected using the IRAM 30m tele-
scope as CO (3–2) line at “z = 2.4”. Their 2(cid:48)(cid:48)resolution 870 µm
SMA image shows an unresolved source centered on a faint optical
source about 3(cid:48)(cid:48)northeast of the SDSS galaxy. The 1.4 GHz FIRST
source VLA J132303.1+553558.6 with S1.4GHz = 2.12 ± 0.26
mJy coincides with the SMA source position.

5.6 PJ142823.9

PJ142823.9 is a bright Herschel source previously identiﬁed as
‘HBootes03’ by Wardlow et al. (2013) and is also a well-known
z = 1.325 Spitzer-identiﬁed hyperluminous infrared galaxy
(HyLIRG) MIPS J142824.0+352619 (Borys et al. 2006; Swinbank
et al. 2006). An extensive discussion of this object is found in
these papers, and here we highlight only the details relevant to
our discussions. We identify the line detected at 99.131 GHz as
that of CO (2–1) line at z = 1.3257 ± 0.0003, and our mea-
sured line integral of S∆V = 4.5 ± 0.7 Jy km s−1 and the line
width of ∆V = 422 ± 21 km s−1 agree very well with the previ-
ously reported Nobeyama Millimeter Array measurements by Iono
et al. (2006, S∆V = 5.3 ± 1.2 Jy km s−1, ∆V = 386 ± 64
km s−1). Borys et al. (2006) have suggested gravitational lens-
ing by a foreground z = 1.034 as a possible explanation for the
large IR luminosity, with a modest magniﬁcation factor (µ < 10).
Hailey-Dunsheath et al. (2010) detected the 158-µm [C II] ﬁne-
structure line and derived a relatively large L[CII]/LF IR ratio of
≈ 2×10−3, much higher than those found in the local ULIRGs and
high-redshift QSOs and more similar to the values seen in the local
starburst galaxies like M82. This large L[CII]/LF IR ratio would
also be naturally explained by gravitational lensing.

5.7 PJ160722.6

PJ160722.6 is the faintest Herschel source matched with the Planck
catalog, with S250µ = 167 mJy and S350µ = 167 mJy, and
its ﬂat SED across the Herschel SPIRE bands is suggestive of
a high redshift source. Our AzTEC imaging revealed a relatively
faint source coincident with the Herschel source (see Fig. 4), with
S1100µ = 7.6 ± 1.0 mJy. This source is detected in all four WISE
bands (see Fig. 7), but its mid-IR SED is ﬂatter than those of the
others. When combined with the photometry from the United States
Naval Observatory B1.0 Catalog (Monet et al. 2003), the optical
to mid-IR SED indicates the presence of a foreground galaxy at
z ∼ 0.65 (see Fig. 5), likely lensing the background SMG. The
single line detected by the RSR at 92.826 GHz is identiﬁed as

the redshift CO (2–1) line at z = 1.4820 ± 0.0004 when anal-
ysed together with its panchromatic SED, as shown in Fig A1.
Its relatively low redshift and modest brightness in the Herschel
bands indicates that PJ160722.6 is a comparatively low luminos-
ity (LIR ≈ 2 × 1013L(cid:12)) object, similar to PJ142823.9 discussed
above. A faint NVSS 1.4 GHz radio source (S1.4GHz = 1.3 ± 0.5
mJy) is also found on the Herschel source position (see Fig. 7).

5.8 PJ160917.8

PJ160917 is another bright Herschel SPIRE source in the “Must-
Do” survey and a “350 µm peaker” with S350µ = 693 mJy. It
has a bright WISE counterpart with a relatively ﬂat SED across its
four bands, and it also has a relatively bright optical counterpart
in SDSS J160918.25+604522.2 with zph = 0.43 (see Fig. 7). A
bright AzTEC source with S1100µ = 73.8 ± 7.0 mJy, unresolved
by the 8.5(cid:48)(cid:48)beam, is detected with a high S/N, coincident with the
Herschel source position (see Fig. 4). Our RSR spectrum shows 2
bright lines (see Fig. 2), unambiguously identifying it as the highest
redshift object in our sample at z = 3.2557 ± 0.0003. Ca˜nameras
et al. (2015) report just one CO line at “z = 3.3”, and their
2(cid:48)(cid:48)resolution 870 µm SMA image shows a classic lensing morphol-
ogy of a partial arc, around the presumed lensing galaxy at z ≈ 0.5.
The 1.4 GHz FIRST VLA source with S1.4GHz = 1.50±0.30 mJy
coincides with the SMA source position.

5.9 Summary on Individual Sources

The well-studied object with the most extensive complementary
data, PJ020941.3, is clearly shown to be a high redshift hyperlu-
minous IR galaxy lensed by a foreground galaxy. Another well-
studied object PJ142823.9 has the smallest apparent luminosity
among our sample and has little evidence to support a lensing sce-
nario. Among the ﬁve Planck-Herschel sources with optical and
SMA continuum imaging by Ca˜nameras et al. (2015), PJ160917.8
is the clearest example of a strongly lensed object, while evidence
for lensing is not as clear for the remaining four. More sensitive,
higher resolution imaging will be necessary to establish the lensing
scenario for these remaining sources.

6 DISCUSSION
6.1 Extreme IR Luminosity of Planck-Herschel Sources

6.1.1

Sources with LIR (cid:62) 1014L(cid:12)

The most remarkable aspect of these Planck-Herschel sources is
that their IR (8-1000 µm) luminosity is among the largest ever
found. As seen in the comparison of our IR luminosity with other
luminous sources discovered by other recent IR surveys in Figure 8,
these Planck-Herschel sources (alongside the independently iden-
tiﬁed and overlapping targets by Ca˜nameras et al. 2015) account
for the majority of sources with rest-frame L8−1000µ (cid:62) 1014L(cid:12).
Nearly all of them either match or exceed the IR luminosity of
the WISE selected HyLIRGs by Tsai et al. (2015) that have re-
cently been reported as “the most IR luminous galaxies”. Five out
of the twenty WISE sources reported by Tsai et al. have rest-frame
LIR (cid:62) 1014L(cid:12), with the z = 4.593 source W2246−0526 being
the most luminous with LIR = 2.2 × 1014L(cid:12). In contrast, six out
of eight Planck-Herschel sources in our sample and G145.2+50.9
in the Ca˜nameras sample have LIR exceeding 1014L(cid:12), and our
brightest source, PJ105353.0 with LIR = 2.9 × 1014L(cid:12), is the

brightest IR galaxy ever discovered. The strongly lensed z = 3.91
QSO APM 08279+5255 (Irwin et al. 1998; Weiss et al. 2007) with
LIR = 2 × 1014L(cid:12) was the only known source with this type of
IR luminosity previously, and these new Planck and WISE surveys
have dramatically increased the number of objects with this type of
IR luminosity, by more than an order of magnitude.

Also shown in Figure 8 is the comparison of IR luminosity for
our sample of Planck-Herschel sources with the strongly lensed
SMGs discovered by Herschel (Bussmann et al. 2013; Wardlow
et al. 2013) and the South Pole Telescope (SPT,Vieira et al. 2013;
Weiß et al. 2013). Their large IR luminosity (LIR = 1012−14L(cid:12))
assisted by gravitational lensing made them popular targets of re-
cent studies of luminous IR galaxy and dusty starburst phenomenon
at z (cid:62) 2, during the epoch of galaxy build-up. This comparison
shows that our Planck-Herschel sources are on average 5-10 times
more luminous than these Herschel and SPT sources, and they are
the most luminous of the IR galaxies population that accounts for
a large fraction of the cosmic star formation history (Le Floc’h
et al. 2005; Caputi et al. 2007; Magnelli et al. 2011). We note that
two of our Planck-Herschel sources (PJ142823.9 & PJ160722.6)
as well as ﬁve of the Ca˜nameras sample sources have IR lumi-
nosity comparable to these Herschel and SPT sources, demonstrat-
ing that the Planck section is sensitive to these “lower luminosity”
(LIR ≈ 1013L(cid:12)) objects as well. None of the Planck selected
sources so far are at z > 4, unlike some of the SPT or Herschel
sources, and this can be accounted by the small sample size and the
comparatively shorter wavelength sample selection.

6.1.2 Nature of their high luminosity: AGN or star formation?

In the local Universe, the fraction of galaxies with a dominant AGN
contribution increases with IR luminosity (e.g., Sanders & Mirabel

galaxies by Kirkpatrick et al. (2013), adopted for WISE photometry instead
of Spitzer photometry. All symbols are the same as Fig. 8. Another IR QSO
H1413+117 is also shown using a diamond symbol in order to illustrate the
parameter space occupied by AGNs. Colour tracks for the z = 2 SF tem-
plate (solid blue line) and the featureless power-law AGN template (long
dashed red line) by Kirkpatrick et al. are shown, starting from z = 0.5 and
ending at z = 4, as marked by the arrows. The WISE photometry for all
sources shown are obtained from the NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive
(IRSA). The 3.4 µm ﬂux is that of the lensing galaxy in some cases (e.g.,
see Fig. 5), leading to a large scatter in the S11µ/S3.4µ ratio for the star
forming galaxies.

1996), and the same trend may also hold true in the earlier epochs.
Many of the high redshift galaxies identiﬁed by early IR surveys,
such as the Cloverleaf (H1413+117) and IRAS F10214+4724 (Bar-
vainis et al. 1992, 1995), are indeed hosting a luminous, dust-
obscured AGN. Therefore, it is natural to suspect ubiquitous AGN
activity among these Planck-Herschel sources, especially given
their extremely large IR luminosity (LIR (cid:62) 1014L(cid:12)) typically
associated with QSOs. Detailed follow-up studies of the SPT and
Herschel sources with LIR (cid:62) 1013L(cid:12) have concluded that many
are gravitationally lensed sources with a typical magniﬁcation fac-
tor of µ ≈ 10 (Bussmann et al. 2013; Vieira et al. 2013; Dye et al.
2014). If some or all of the Planck-Herschel sources are also mag-
niﬁed by a similar factor (µ ≈ 10 for PJ020941.3, Geach et al.
2015), then their intrinsic IR luminosity is LIR (cid:62) 1013L(cid:12), still in
the QSO regime.

A quantitative analysis of the AGN contribution to the total IR
luminosity is possible if the mid- to far-IR SED is fully mapped.
By analyzing a large sample of high redshift galaxies with exten-
sive mid- and far-IR data from Spitzer and Herschel, Kirkpatrick
et al. (2012, 2013) have shown that the energetic contribution by
AGN activity can be determined quantitatively through a spectral
decomposition, even for heavily obscured, Compton thick sources.
In particular, Kirkpatrick et al. (2013) have shown that combining
the longer wavelength photometry from Herschel with mid-IR pho-
tometry from Spitzer (or WISE) yields the most reliable separation
of AGN and SF dominated galaxies since they probe the widest
range of dust properties affected.

A modiﬁed version of this mid-IR to far-IR colour diag-

nostic plot, replacing Spitzer photometry bands with WISE pho-
tometry bands, is shown in Figure 9, and our Planck-Herschel
sources appear in the region dominated by star formation ac-
tivity. The two IR QSOs with the characteristic broad emission
lines, APM 08279+5255 (Irwin et al. 1998) and the Cloverleaf
(H1413+117, Barvainis et al. 1992, 1995) are located near the
colour track of the featureless power-law AGN (long dashed line),
as expected. All but one of the luminous WISE-selected IR galaxies
have a relatively ﬂat mid- to far-IR ﬂux ratio (S250µ/S11µ) charac-
teristic of power-law AGNs, but with systematically redder mid-IR
colour (S11µ/S3.4µ > 30). By analysing their SEDs, Tsai et al.
(2015) have concluded that these WISE-selected sources are likely
powered by highly obscured AGNs, with their hot dust (Td ∼ 450
K) accounting for the high luminosities. Their mid-IR colour is
systematically redder than the power-law AGN model track, but
this is a consequence of the “W1W2-dropout” selection in their
sample deﬁnition. In contrast, nearly all of our Planck-Herschel
sources (also by Ca˜nameras et al. 2015) as well as all of the
SPT- and Herschel-selected IR sources appear along the SF tem-
plate track (solid line). Kirkpatrick et al. (2015) have shown that
AGN-powered sources rapidly cross over from the SF dominated
to the AGN region on this diagnostic plot once the AGN contribu-
tion exceeds 60% of the total luminosity, and this analysis clearly
indicates that our Planck-Herschel sources are primarily powered
by SF activity. This conclusion is further supported by the fact that
nearly all Planck-Herschel sources also follow the radio-IR corre-
lation characteristic of star forming galaxies (see § 4.2 and Fig. 5),
and the nature of the energetic activities powering their large lu-
minosity is substantially different between the Planck-selected and
the WISE-selected SMGs, despite their similarly extremely IR lu-
minosity.

6.2 Molecular Gas Mass Estimates

6.2.1 Gas Mass Estimates from CO Line Luminosity

A standard method for deriving a total molecular gas mass from
a redshifted CO line measurement is to adopt a line ratio be-
tween different rotational transitions to estimate the CO (1–0) tran-
sition luminosity L(cid:48)
CO(1−0) and then to translate this line lumi-
nosity to a total molecular gas mass assuming an “αCO” con-
version factor (see the review by Carilli & Walter 2013). The
Table 2 by Carilli & Walter (2013) gives the average CO line
ratios for SMGs as L(cid:48)
CO(1−0),
and L(cid:48)
CO(1−0) of 0.85, 0.66, and 0.46, respectively.
Using these ratios, we can convert the measured CO line lumi-
nosities reported in Table 2 to L(cid:48)
CO(1−0) and then to MH2 us-
ing the “Galactic” conversion factor αCO ≡ MH2/L(cid:48)
CO(1−0) =
4.3M(cid:12) [K kms−1 pc−2]−1 (Bolatto et al. 2013).

CO(1−0), L(cid:48)

CO(4−3)/L(cid:48)

CO(2−1)/L(cid:48)

CO(3−2)/L(cid:48)

The derived total molecular gas masses of our eight Planck-
Herschel sources, uncorrected for the unknown magniﬁcation fac-
tor µ, range between µMH2 = 5.4× 1011M(cid:12) and 7.8× 1012M(cid:12).
For a typical magniﬁcation factor of µ ∼ 10, the intrinsic molecu-
lar gas masses range between (0.5− 8)× 1011M(cid:12), which are near
to top of the range of gas masses found for high redshift SMGs
that are not strongly lensed (see Carilli & Walter 2013). The mea-
sured line widths (FWHM) of 400-650 km s−1 are somewhat large,
but they are fairly typical for the most gas-rich SMGs (see Fig. 5
by Carilli & Walter). We note that earlier studies often used the
“ULIRG” conversion factor of 0.8M(cid:12)[K kms−1 pc−2]−1, lead-
ing to systematically smaller total gas mass, without a clear physi-
cally motivated justiﬁcation. Following Scoville et al. (2015), who

have argued for using the Galactic conversion even for high red-
shift SMGs after a thorough review of the topic, we also adopt the
Galactic conversion factor for our molecular gas mass estimates.
We revisit this decision by comparing these total molecular gas
mass estimates with the dust continuum based ISM mass estimates
in the next section (§ 6.2.2).

An upper bound to the total mass requires that the total gas
mass cannot exceed the dynamical mass of the system. A virial
mass of a pressure supported spherical system with a 1-D velocity
dispersion (σ ≡ F W HM/8ln2) is 6×109[ F W HM
400 km s−1 ]2RkpcM(cid:12),
where Rkpc is the characteristic radius of the system in kpc. For
a rotationally supported disk with a radius Rkpc, an equivalent
dynamical mass with a rotational speed Vcirc ≡ F HW M/2 is
9 × 109[ F W HM
400 km s−1 ]2RkpcM(cid:12). Therefore, the maximum possible
gas mass for a 10 kpc radius disk is 2.4 × 1011M(cid:12) for a galaxy
with observed CO line width of 650 km s−1, which exceeds the
CO-derived gas mass for the eight Planck-Herschel sources by fac-
tors of 2 to 30. These gas mass estimates may be somewhat over-
estimated, by a factor of order unity as discussed below. Account-
ing for the remainder of the difference requires that nearly all of
these galaxies must be strongly lensed by at least these factors (2
to 30), even though we lack any direct evidence for lensing in most
cases. The empirical estimate for the magniﬁcation factor based on
measured CO line width and line luminosity, as proposed by Har-
ris et al. (2012), is essentially a different formulation of this upper
mass limit.

6.2.2

ISM Mass Estimates from AzTEC 1100 µm Photometry

As an alternative to deriving total gas mass from CO measurements
that can be observationally expensive, Scoville et al. (2015) have
proposed an empirical calibration for total ISM mass derived from
the optically thin, long wavelength dust continuum emission and
adopting a gas-to-dust ratio (GDR). As shown in their Figure 1, CO
line luminosity L(cid:48)
CO is linearly correlated with the monochromatic
luminosity L850µ at the rest frame 850 µm for local star forming
galaxies, local ULIRGs, and z ∼ 2 SMGs, spanning over six orders

ratio of gas masses derived from AzTEC 1100 µm ﬂux (MISM ) to the
CO-derived MH2. The median GDR derived for the eight Planck-Herschel
sources is ≈ 250, while the median MISM /MH2 ratio is ≈ 0.65.

of magnitude in luminosity. This in turn can be used to derive a dust
mass using the constant scaling factor α850µ = L850µ/Md based
on the local calibration.

Our AzTEC 1100 µm photometry is well suited for this appli-
cation as we are probing near the Rayleigh-Jeans part of the spec-
trum (νrest = 260-470 µm) at the redshift of these Planck-Herschel
sources (see Fig. 5). Considering that the average IR luminosity
density should be at least 10 times higher for our Planck-Herschel
sources compared with the local and z ∼ 2 galaxies used for the
calibration, we adopt a dust temperature 1.5 times higher than con-
sidered by Scoville et al., or Td = 35 K3. Adopting Eq. A14 by
Scoville et al., the ISM mass, which is effectively the total molecu-
lar gas mass, can be derived from the observed AzTEC ﬂux density
as,

MISM (M(cid:12)) =

where DL is the luminosity distance in Mpc, and S1100µ is the
measured ﬂux density at 1100 µm in mJy (for λrest (cid:62) 250 µm).
Here we adopt the value of α850 = 6.7 × 1019 ergs/sec/Hz/ M(cid:12)
(Scoville et al. Eq. A11), and the RJ correction factor ΓRJ that
accounts for any deviation away from the ν2 dependance as

ΓRJ (Td, νobs, z) =

hνobs(1 + z)/kTd

exp(hνobs(1 + z)/kTd) − 1

.

The total ISM mass we derive for these Planck-Herschel
sources range between µMISM = 5.0 × 1011M(cid:12) and 5.1 ×
1012M(cid:12), uncorrected for the unknown magniﬁcation factor µ (see
Table 4). As shown in Figure 10, the median ratio between this
ISM mass and the CO-derived MH2 mass (§ 6.2.1) for our sample
is (cid:104)MISM /MH2(cid:105) ≈ 0.65, with a signiﬁcant scatter, and this indi-
cates that the ISM mass derived from the AzTEC 1100 µm photom-
etry is systematically smaller by a factor of 1.5 compared with the
CO-derived MH2. The sample plot also shows that the gas-to-dust
ratio for the same sample has a median value of (cid:104)MISM /Md(cid:105) ≈
250, which is close to the nominal value in the local Universe for
metal-rich galaxies (≈ 170, Draine et al. 2007). This median value
and the small scatter suggest that the ISM masses derived follow-
ing calibration by Scoville et al. (2015) and the dust masses derived
using an independent calibration (see Appendix D) are at least con-
sistent, probably because of their shared assumptions.

A possible explanation that our CO-derived MH2 might be
a slight over-estimate is in line with the results of recent theoreti-
cal works. By modeling the impact of metallicity, gas temperature,
and velocity dispersion, Narayanan et al. (2012) have postulated a
weakly dependent reduction in αCO with increasing velocity dis-
persion for high redshift galaxies with a larger turbulent support.
Speciﬁcally, Narayanan et al. model predicts a reduction in αCO
by 20% and 40% (compared with the Galactic value) with a factor
of 2 and 5 increase in velocity dispersion, respectively. A reduc-
tion in αCO by this magnitude would bring our MISM /MH2 ra-
tio and the gas-to-dust ratio to a much better agreement. We note
that our estimates of MH2 are systematically larger than those re-
ported by Ca˜nameras et al. (2015) by a signiﬁcant amount, with
the median for the ﬁve objects in common being 6.6 times larger
for our estimates. In their gas mass derivation, Ca˜nameras et al.
adopted the “ULIRG” conversion factor, which immediately leads

3 This adopted dust temperature is lower than the the luminosity-weighted
dust temperature derived from the IR SED analysis (Td = 42-84 K, see
Table 4), but Scoville et al. (2015) make a compelling argument for using a
lower, mass-weighted Td – see their Appendix A.2 for a detailed discussion.

c(cid:13) 2016 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–??

to 5 times smaller gas masses. In addition, Ca˜nameras et al. did
not explicitly account for the excitation dependent correction for
observing different CO rotational transitions (see Carilli & Walter
2013), leading to a further factor of 1.5 reduction in their H2 mass
estimates. Their combined effects should lead to 7.5 times smaller
H2 masses, which can more than account for the factor of 6.6 dif-
ference. The lower gas masses derived by Ca˜nameras et al. should
in turn lead to an average gas-to-dust ratio of GDR ≈ 354. These
considerations of average GDR and MISM /MH2 ratio suggest that
our CO-derived gas masses are within a factor of 2 of the correct
values.

7 CONCLUSIONS

A further understanding of how to link the IR galaxies making up
the cosmic infrared background (CIRB) with the entire galaxy pop-
ulation across all redshifts is revolutionized by the systematic de-
tection of gravitationally lensed SMGs. These systems are some
of the most interesting objects to study because the magnifying
property of lensing allow us to probe (1) physical details of the
intense star formation activities at sub-kpc scale that are beyond
the conventional means including the ALMA and the JVLA; and
(2) dusty star forming galaxies beyond the current detection limit,
with SF R = 10−100 M(cid:12) yr−1 that account for the bulk of stellar
mass build-up at 1 < z < 4.

In this pilot study for identifying a large population of strongly
lensed SMGs using the Planck survey data, we report our success-
ful identiﬁcation of eight candidate sources drawn from the Planck
Compact Source Catalog using the public Herschel archival data
and the results from our detailed follow-up investigation utiliz-
ing new AzTEC 8.5(cid:48)(cid:48)resolution 1100 µm imaging and CO spec-
troscopy using the Redshift Search Receiver on the LMT. Our new
observations have shown that these are some of the most lumi-
nous galaxies ever found with LIR up to 3 × 1014µ−1L(cid:12), and
our Planck-Herschel sources at redshifts of 1.3 < zCO < 3.3 are
also some of the most gas-rich galaxies found (MH2 = (0.6 −
7.8) × 1011M(cid:12) for µ ≈ 10). The SED analysis using the mid- to
far-IR colour diagnostic plot developed by Kirkpatrick et al. (2013)
shows that these sources are powered primarily by the intense SF
activity, unlike the similarly luminous IR galaxies identiﬁed in the
WISE survey by Tsai et al. (2015), which are powered primarily by
luminous AGNs. Our examination of the radio-IR correlation also
supports this SF scenario.

The results of our pilot study suggest that a much larger pop-
ulation of strongly lensed SMGs can be potentially found in the
Planck Compact Source Catalog, including sources with LIR down
to ∼ 1013µ−1L(cid:12). At least four (out of eight) Planck-Herschel
sources are associated with a bright foreground optical galaxy,
strongly supporting the lensing hypothesis, and the z = 2.554
source PJ020941.3 has been deﬁnitively shown to be a partial Ein-
stein ring lensed by a z = 0.2 foreground galaxy (µ ≈ 13, Geach
et al. 2015). A larger survey to identify a much larger sample of

4 Ca˜nameras et al. (2015) report gas-to-dust ratios of GDR = 32 − 112
using their CO-derived MH2 and dust mass derived from their SED mod-
eling. This low GDR suggests that either they under-estimate their gas
masses or over-estimate the dust masses. In deriving their dust masses,
Ca˜nameras et al. use the luminosity-weighted Td, which should lead to sys-
tematically lower estimates of Md, as explicitly cautioned to avoid by Scov-
ille et al. (2015). Therefore, it follows that their MH2 estimates are indeed
substantially under-estimated.

APPENDIX A: DETERMINING UNIQUE CO REDSHIFT
USING IR PHOTOMETRIC REDSHIFT

A unique redshift can be determined when two or more spectral
lines are detected in a single RSR spectrum, such as for PJ160917.8
in Fig. 2. Only one CO line falls within RSR band in the redshift
range between z = 0 and z ≈ 3.15, however, and additional in-
formation such as photometric redshift is needed in order to dis-
tinguish different redshift solutions – see discussions by Yun et al.
(2015). Speciﬁcally, Yun et al. have demonstrated the use of radio-
millimetric photometric redshift technique (Carilli & Yun 1999) as
an effective means to provide the redshift support using minimum
additional data. A more thorough photometric redshift analysis us-
ing all available photometry data can in principle provide a stronger
support for the redshift discrimination.

The use of a full photometric redshift analysis for deriving
a unique redshift solution for an RSR spectrum is demonstrated
in Fig. A1. For this analysis, photometric data points from WISE
(11 & 22 µm), Herschel, AzTEC, and VLA are analyzed using the
template SEDs by Efstathiou et al. (2000). A minimum χ2 value
for an entire suite of template SEDs is computed at each grid point
in the redshift-luminosity parameter space, and a map of the min-
imum χ2 values is constructed. The over-all best ﬁt solution with
the overall minimum χ2 is shown as an asterisk in each panel, and
it is often close to one of the redshift solutions corresponding to a
CO line seen in the RSR spectrum. The dotted and solid contours
denote the 68 and 90 percentile conﬁdence levels derived based
on the reduced χ2 values (Wall 1996), and a weighted likelihood
is used to select a unique redshift solution based on this analysis.
Vertical gaps and discontinuities in the conﬁdence contours seen
in some panels are the artifacts arising from the WISE photometry
points passing through the PAH emission line features in the SED
templates, which are generally not modeled very well by the tem-
plates used. These WISE photometry provide useful constraint on
the photometric redshift for high redshift dusty starbursts with their
characteristic red colour (see Yun et al. 2008, 2012), and including
these data is still helpful for narrowing down the acceptable solu-
tions, even with these apparent artifacts.

APPENDIX B: LINE WIDTH CORRECTION FOR THE
INSTRUMENTAL RESOLUTION

to be at

Unlike nearby spiral galaxies that are rotationally supported, many
high redshift CO sources are thought
least partially
pressure-supported, and their CO line proﬁles are often character-
ized as a Gaussian in shape. The frequency response of the RSR
is also roughly Gaussian. For a line with an intrinsic Gaussian
width σ0, the full width half maximum (FWHM) CO line width
is W0 = σ0
8ln2. The measured CO line then has a Gaussian
width of σc with an apparent line width of Wc = σc
8ln2, which
is the result of the intrinsic line width W0 convolved with the In-
strumental resolution of R = σR
R,
0 + σ2
the intrinsic line width W0 can be recovered as

8ln2. Since σc =(cid:112)σ2

Figure A1. A χ2 based panchromatic photometric redshift support for determining a unique CO redshift. The minimum χ2 solution is marked by an asterisk,
and the dotted and solid contour denote the 68 and 90 percentile conﬁdence levels (Wall 1996). Discrete possible redshift solutions corresponding to the
observed CO lines are shown as regularly spaced vertical lines in each panel.

The spectral channel width of 31.25 MHz translates to a veloc-
) km s−1, where νCO is the ob-
ity resolution of R = 100 ( 93.75
νCO
served CO line frequency in GHz. The CO line width ∆V reported
in Table 2 is the deconvolved line width W0 after correcting for
the instrumental spectral resolution of the RSR as shown here. The
magnitude of correction is small, (cid:54) 30 km s−1, and is expected
to be signiﬁcantly only when the line width is close to the spectral
resolution.

APPENDIX C: MODIFIED BLACKBODY MODEL

The dust mass estimates are highly dependent on the dust temper-
ature distribution amongst the ISM. Yun & Carilli (2002) provide
an expression for a radio-to-FIR spectrum parameterised by SFR,
dust temperature, and luminosity distance in their Eq 15. In order
to characterize the dust temperature for each source we adapted
this equation to its relative functional form with dust temperature
as a free parameter. In modeling the Rayleigh-Jeans part of the dust
spectrum, one can adopt a value for νc, the critical frequency at
which the light coming from the dust clouds becomes optically
thick. We take νc to be 2000 GHz (150 µm) as in Yun & Car-
illi. The dust emissivity index, β, is held ﬁxed at a value of 1.8 to
remain consistent with the comparative analyses by Scoville et al.
(2015). Typical values for β with respect to SMGs range from 1.5
to 2.0 (see Scoville et al. 2014). There are essentially two descrip-
tors of the SED model that uniquely characterize the best ﬁt once a
given value for β is assumed: a normalization factor related to the

total star formation rate SF R, and the dust temperature Td.

Sd(ν) =

(1.3 × 10−6)(SF R)(1 + z)ν3

L[e0.048ν0/Td − 1]
D2

0

[1 − e

−(ν0/νc)β

]

where ν0 ≡ (1 + z)ν is the frequency in the rest frame of the
object. A discrete range of normalization factors for each source
were recorded for every dust temperature sampled (ranging from
0.5-99.5 K with increments of 0.4 K) in order to compute min-
imum reduced χ2 values. In order to track the internal degener-
acy between the normalization factor and dust temperature and to
effectively characterize the upper and lower limits, we produce a
2-dimensional plot given the normalization factor versus the rest-
frame dust temperature.

The resulting SED analyses for each sample galaxy are shown
in Figure C1. The minimum χ2 is marked with an asterisk, and the
68 and 90 percentile conﬁdence levels computed following Wall
(1996) are shown by a solid and dot-dash contours. By modifying
the Yun & Carilli (2002) relation as adopted here, the term “SF R”
is no longer a true estimate of star formation rate and is simply a
scaling factor instead. We explicitly compute IR luminosity (LIR,
λ = 8-1000 µm) from the best ﬁt model and compute star forma-
tion rate using the calibration by Kennicutt (1998) corrected for the
Kroupa IMF. The best ﬁt modiﬁed blackbody model parameters
and derived quantities are reported in Table 4.

Figure C1. Best ﬁt χ2 analysis for the modiﬁed blackbody models. The minimum χ2 is marked with an asterisk while the 68 and 90 percentile conﬁdence
levels are shown by a solid and dot-dash contours (Wall 1996). A weak constraint on Td is shown by the elongation of the conﬁdence contours, and additional
photometry measurements just shortward of the dust peak will be essential for an improved characterization of Td.

APPENDIX D: DUST MASS CALCULATION

observed frequency νobs ≡ νrest/(1 + z) as

Following Hildebrand (1983), the total dust mass detected with a
ﬂux density of Sν at the observed frequency ν, located at a lumi-
nosity distance of DL is

Md =

Md =

where κν is the mass absorption coefﬁcient and Bν is the Planck
function,

Bν (T ) =

e(hν)/kT − 1

.

Mass absorption coefﬁcient κν is a major source of uncertainty,
arising from our poor understanding of the grain properties such as
density, size, shape, etc. (see Hughes et al. 1997). Several authors
reviewed this subject and produced new estimates with varying as-
sumptions (e.g. James et al. 2002; Dunne et al. 2003), all falling
within a factor of 2 of the Hughes et al. value κ800µ = 0.15 m2
kg−1. Thus for our dust mass calculation we adopt

κν = 0.15 [

where dust emissivity β = 1.8 is the same value used for the ISM
mass calculation in § 6.2.2. We a caution that a systematic uncer-
tainly of up to a factor of 2 may result from this choice of κν.

For a galaxy at high redshift z, we can re-write the equation
for dust mass in terms of the measured ﬂux density Sν,obs at the
