DOMINATION OF MULTILINEAR SINGULAR INTEGRALS

BY POSITIVE SPARSE FORMS

AMALIA CULIUC, FRANCESCO DI PLINIO, AND YUMENG OU

ABSTRACT. We establish a uniform domination of the family of trilinear multiplier forms with
singularity over a one-dimensional subspace by positive sparse forms involving L p-averages.
This class includes the adjoint forms to the bilinear Hilbert transforms. Our result strength-
ens the L p-boundedness proved in [21] and entails as a corollary a rich multilinear weighted
theory. In particular, we obtain Lq1(v1) × Lq2(v2)-boundedness of the bilinear Hilbert trans-
∩ RH2. Our proof relies on a stopping
form when the weights vj belong to the class A q+1
time construction based on newly developed localized outer-L p embedding theorems for the
wave packet transform.

1. INTRODUCTION AND MAIN RESULTS

The L p-boundedness theory of Calderón-Zygmund operators, whose prototype is the Hil-
bert transform, plays a central role in harmonic analysis and in its applications to elliptic
partial differential equations, geometric measure theory and related ﬁelds.

A recent remarkable discovery is that the action of a singular integral operator T on a
function f can be dominated in a pointwise sense by the averages of f over a sparse, i.e.
essentially disjoint, collection of cubes in Rn. This control is much stronger than L p-norm
bounds and carries signiﬁcantly more information on the operator itself. As of now, the
most striking consequence is that sharp weighted norm inequalities for T follow from the
corresponding, rather immediate estimates for the averaging operators. Such a pointwise
domination principle, albeit in a slightly weaker sense, appears explicitly for the ﬁrst time in
the proof of the A2 theorem by Lerner [17]. We also point out the recent improvements by
Lacey [11] and Lerner [15], and the analogue for multilinear Calderón-Zygmund operators
by Lerner and Nazarov [16]. Most recently, Bernicot, Frey and Petermichl [3] extend this
approach to non-integral singular operators associated with a second-order elliptic operator,
lying outside the scope of classical Calderón-Zygmund theory.

The main focus of the present article is to formulate a similar principle for the class of
multilinear multiplier operators, invariant under simultaneous modulations of the input
functions, which includes the bilinear Hilbert transforms. Besides their intrinsic interest,
our results yield a rich, and sharp in a suitable sense, family of multilinear weighted bounds
for this class of operators. These have been mentioned as an open problem in several related
works [7, 9].

Let Γ = {ξ = (ξ1, ξ2, ξ3) ∈ R3 : ξ1 + ξ2 + ξ3 = 0} and β ∈ Γ be a ﬁxed unit vector,

nondegenerate in the sense that

∆β = min
k6= j

|βk − β j| > 0.

We are concerned with the trilinear forms

The one-parameter family (with respect to β ) of trilinear forms adjoint to the bilinear
Hilbert transforms is obtained by choosing

m(ξ) = sign(ξ · β ).

In [21], substantially elaborating on the seminal work by Lacey and Thiele [12, 13], Mus-
calu, Tao and Thiele prove the following result.

Theorem 1. [21, Theorem 1.1] Let m be a multiplier satisfying (1.2). Then the adjoint
bilinear operators Tm to the forms Λm of (1.1) have the mapping properties

(1.3)

Tm : Lq1(R) × Lq2(R) → L

for all exponent pairs (q1, q2) satisfying 1 < inf{q1, q2} < ∞ and

.

Not unexpectedly, a pointwise domination principle for this class of bilinear operators is
not allowed to hold, as we elaborate in Remark 1.3 below. This obstruction is overcome by
introducing the closely related notion of domination by sparse positive forms of the adjoint
trilinear form, which we turn to in what follows.

We say that S is a η-sparse collection of intervals I ⊂ R if for every I ∈ S there exists a
measurable EI ⊂ I with |EI | ≥ η|I | such that {EI : I ∈ S} are pairwise disjoint. The positive
sparse trilinear form of type ~p = (p1, p2, p3) associated to the sparse collection S is deﬁned
by

we omit the subscript and write 〈 f 〉I when p = 1. A rather immediate consequence of the
Hardy-Littlewood maximal theorem is the following proposition.

Proposition 1.1. Let T be a bilinear operator. Suppose that for all tuples ( f1, f2, f3) ∈ C∞
there holds

2Yj=1

k f jkq j

provided that p j < q j ≤ ∞ for j = 1, 2 and inf{q1, q2} < ∞.

Our main result is a strengthening of Theorem 1 to a domination by positive sparse forms.
To formulate it, we need one more notion. We say that ~p = (p1, p2, p3) is an admissible tuple
if

(1.7)

1 ≤ p1, p2, p3 < ∞,

ǫ(~p) := 2 −

3Xj=1

If all the constraints hold with strict inequality, we say that ~p is an open admissible tuple.

Theorem 2. Let ~p be an open admissible tuple. There exists K = K(~p), N = N (~p) such that
the following holds. For any tuple ( f1, f2, f3) ∈ C∞

that

where the supremum is being taken over the family of multipliers m satisfying (1.2).

We stress that the constants K and N depend only on the exponent tuple ~p, and the choice
of the sparse collection S depends only on f1, f2, f3 and ~p and is, in particular, independent
of the multiplier m.

Remark 1.2 (Sharpness of Theorem 2). Let (q1, q2) be an exponent pair with 1 < inf{q1, q2} <
∞. Then there exists an open admissible tuple ~p = (p1, p2, p3) with p1 < q1, p2 < q2 if and
only if (1.4) holds for (q1, q2). This observation, coupled with Proposition 1.1, yields Theo-
rem 1 as a corollary of Theorem 2.

On the other hand, let φ be an even Schwartz function with 1

{β , γ} be an orthonormal basis of Γ. Deﬁne the family of multipliers on Γ

[−2−3,2−3],

while the family {m~σ,M : M ∈ N, ~σ ∈ {−1, 1}M } satisﬁes (1.2) uniformly. This implies that
the range (1.4) of Theorem 1 is sharp up to equality holding in (1.4) and, in turn, that
(1.8) cannot hold for any tuple violating (1.7). Hence, Theorem 2 is sharp up to possibly
replacing the assumption open admissible with the stronger admissible. The behavior of the
forms Λm for tuples at the boundary of the admissible region is studied in detail in [6].

Remark 1.3 (No uniform control by a bilinear positive sparse operator). For bilinear Calderón-
Zygmund operators T , there holds a pointwise domination by sparse operators of the type

|T ( f1, f2)(x )| ≤ C XI ∈S( f1, f2)

〈 f1〉I ,p1

〈 f2〉I ,p2

One can take p1 = p2 = 1: see [16]. Essentially self-adjoint operators T enjoying such
pointwise domination inherit the boundedness property

which, as described in the previous Remark 1.2, fails for the generic Tm of the class (1.2)
In fact, no L1-boundedness properties are expected to hold even
when inf{p1, p2} < 2.
for the bilinear Hilbert transforms. Summarizing, no such pointwise domination principle
can be obtained for Tm when inf{p1, p2} < 2 and, most likely, neither for the case when
inf{p1, p2} ≥ 2. Our formulation in terms of positive sparse forms overcomes this obstacle:
a similar idea, albeit not explicit, appears in the linear setting in [3].

Theorem 2 implies multilinear weighted bounds for the forms Λm. We remark that,
aside from unpublished work of X. Li [19], Theorem 3 and Corollary 4 below are the ﬁrst
examples of weighted estimates for a class of modulation invariant multipliers including
the bilinear Hilbert transform.

Our ﬁrst weighted theorem will actually involve multilinear A~p

~q Muckenhoupt constants.

Given any tuple ~p, a Hölder tuple ~q and a weight vector ~v = (v1, v2, v3) satisfying

(1.10)

For ~p = (1, 1, 1), these weight classes have been introduced in [18], to which we send for
an exhaustive discussion of their properties. A particular case of (1.11) (where p1 = 1)
appears in [10] as a necessary and sufﬁcient condition for weighted Lq-boundedness of the
bilinear fractional integrals.

Theorem 3. Let ~q be a Hölder tuple with 1 < q1, q2, q3 < ∞ and ~v be a weight vector satisfying
(1.10). Then there holds

One is usually interested in weighted estimates involving Muckenhoupt and reverse
Hölder constants of each single weight. Recall that the Aq and RHα constant of a weight v
on R are deﬁned as

remark that if q > 1 then [4, Section 3.8] v ∈ A q+1
that a theory of linear extrapolation for weights in the Aq ∩ RHα classes has been introduced
in [1]; see also the already mentioned monograph [4]. As a further application of Corollary
4, weighted, vector-valued estimates for multipliers Tm satisfying condition (1.2), extending
the results of [2, 22] can be obtained by a multilinear version of the extrapolation theory
of [1]. These extensions are the object of an upcoming companion article by the same
authors.

Structure of the article and proof techniques. The class of multipliers (1.2), in addition
to the familiar invariances under isotropic dilations and translations proper of Coifman-
Meyer type multipliers, enjoys a one-parameter invariance under simultaneous modulation
of the three input functions along the line Rγ = {β , (1, 1, 1)}⊥. The invariance properties of
the class (1.2) are essentially shared by a family of discretized trilinear forms involving the
maximal wave packet coefﬁcients of the input functions parametrized by rank 1 collection
of tritiles, which we call tritile form.

The ﬁrst step in the proof of Theorem 2, carried out in Section 2, is to establish that
for any multiplier m satisfying (1.2), the form Λm lies in the convex hull of ﬁnitely many
tritile forms. This discretization procedure is largely the same as the one employed in
[21]. Theorem 2 then reduces to the analogous result for tritile forms, Theorem 5. It is
of paramount importance here that the sparse collection S constructed in Theorem 5 is
independent of the particular tritile form.

The explicit construction of the collection S, and in fact the proof of Theorem 5, is
performed in Section 5 by means of an inductive argument. The intervals of S are, roughly
speaking, the stopping intervals of the p j-Hardy-Littlewood maximal function of the j-th
input. At each stage of the argument, the contribution of those wave packets localized
within one of the stopping intervals will be estimated at the next step of the induction,
after a careful removal of the tail terms. The main term, which is the contribution of

χI (x ) := χ x−c(I ))

the wave packets whose spatial localization is not contained in the union of the stopping
interval is estimated by means of a localized outer L p j embedding Theorem for the wave
packet transform.

This outer L p embedding, which is the concern of Proposition 4.1, is a close relative of the
main result of [5] by two of us, namely, a localized embedding theorem for the continuous
wave packet transform. In fact, while Proposition 4.1 is proved here via a transference ar-
gument based upon [5, Theorem 1], a direct proof can be given by repeating the arguments
of [5] in the discrete setting. The construction of the outer L p spaces on rank 1 collections,
which parallels the outer L p theory introduced by Do and Thiele in [8], is performed in
Section 3.

Finally, Section 6 contains the proof of the weighted estimates of Theorem 3 and 4.

Notation. Let χ(x ) = (1+|x |2)−1. For an interval I centered at c(I ) and of length ℓ(I ) = |I |,
we write

k f kL p(χ N

, 1 ≤ p < ∞,

k f kL∞(χ N

I ) = k f χ N

I k∞.

with N positive integer. We write

Mp( f )(x ) = sup

〈 f 〉I ,p

for the p-Hardy Littlewood maximal functions. Finally, the constants implied by almost
inequality sign ® and the comparability sign ∼ are meant to be absolute throughout the
article.

2. TRITILE MAPS

In this section, we reduce Theorem 2 to the corresponding statement for a class of mul-
tilinear forms which we call tritile maps. Throughout, we assume that the nondegenerate
unit vector β ∈ Γ is ﬁxed and let γ ∈ Γ be a unit vector perpendicular to β , spanning the
singular line of the multipliers m from (1.2).

2.1. Rank 1 collection of tri-tiles. A tile T = IT × ωT is the cartesian product of two
intervals IT , ωT with |IT ||ωT | ∼ 1. A tri-tile P = (P1, P2, P3) is an ordered triple of tiles
Pj, j = 1, 2, 3 with the property that

we denote by ~ωP = ωP1

2.2. Tritile forms. Let AN be a ﬁxed increasing sequence of positive constants. For each
tile T we deﬁne the adapted family Φ(T ) to be the collection of Schwartz functions φT
satisfying

2.3. Reduction to uniform bounds for tritile forms. The following lemma is a refor-
mulation of the well-known discretization procedure from [21]. Several versions of this
procedure have since appeared, see for instance the monographs [20, 23]. We omit the
standard (by now) proof.

Lemma 2.1. There exists a ﬁnite collection {P1, . . . , PG} of rank 1 collections of tritiles such
that, for any multiplier m satisfying (1.2) and any tuple of Schwartz functions f1, f2, f3, there
holds

|Λm( f1, f2, f3)| ≤

ΛP j ( f1, f2, f3)

GXj=1

and the adaptation constants {AN } of the adapted families deﬁning ΛP j depend on {CN } only.
Furthermore, the character G depends only on the nondegeneracy constant of β .

Theorem 2 is then an immediate consequence of Lemma 2.1 and of the following dis-

cretized version, whose proof is given in Section 5.

Theorem 5. Let ~p be an open admissible tuple. There exists K = K(~p), N = N (~p) such that
the following holds. For any tuple ( f1, f2, f3) with f j ∈ L p j (R) and compactly supported there

where the supremum is being taken over all rank 1 collections of tritiles P of ﬁnite cardinality
and adaptation sequence {AN }. In particular, the collection S depends only on f1, f2, f3 and the
tuple ~p.

3. OUTER L p

SPACES OF TRITILES

In this section, we formulate the outer measure space that is needed for our proof, which
is based on a ﬁnite rank 1 collection of tritiles P. Recall that ωP = co(3ωP1
).
The generating collection is the set of trees T ⊂ P(P). The set T ⊂ P is a tree with top data
(IT, ξT) if

, 3ωP3

, 3ωP2

IP ⊂ IT,

ξT ∈ ωP

∀P ∈ P.

By property d. of the rank 1 collections, we have that each tree T can be written as the
union

T = [1≤ j<k≤3

T \ (T j ∪ Tk)

(3.1)

(3.2)

where each T j is a tree with the same top data as T and has the additional property

{3ωPk

: P ∈ T j} are a pairwise disjoint collection for k 6= j.

The premeasure σ : T → [0, ∞) is given by

σ(T) := |IT|.

We now deﬁne a tuple of sizes on P, that is, homogeneous and quasi-subadditive maps
CP → [0, ∞]T . For each j = 1, 2, 3 we deﬁne the corresponding size on functions F : P → C
by

In this section, when we write dyadic interval, we mean intervals I ∈ D, where D is a ﬁxed
dyadic grid on R. Fix a dyadic interval Q ⊂ R and f ∈ L p(R). We deﬁne the p-stopping

In what follows, we ﬁx a ﬁnite collection of rank 1 tritiles P whose intervals {IP : P ∈ P}

are dyadic. We introduce the notation P≤(I ) = {P ∈ P : IP ⊂ I } and the set of good tritiles

Recalling the deﬁnition of the tritile maps from (2.2), we have the following proposition,
which is used to control the main term of the tritile forms (2.3) localized to 3Q.

Proposition 4.1. Let Q ⊂ R be a dyadic interval and f be a Schwartz function. For any
1 < p < 2, q > p′ there exists N = N (p, q) and K = K(p, q) such that

4.1. Proof of Proposition 4.1. The Proposition will be proved by a transference argument
using the main result of [5], which is the continuous parameter version recalled below.
However, Proposition 4.1 may also be obtained directly, by repeating the arguments of [5]
in the (simpler, in fact) discrete parameter setting. We leave the details to the interested
reader.

4.1.1. A continuous parameters version of Proposition 4.1. We need to deﬁne the continuous
outer measure space on the base set

P◦ = [−R, R] × (0, R] × [−R, R],

R = 10 max{c(IP ) + |IP | + c(ωP ) + |ωP | : P ∈ P};

we are using that P is a ﬁnite set. Let I ⊂ R be an interval and ξ ∈ R. The corresponding
generalized tent and its lacunary part, with ﬁxed geometric parameters g, b, are deﬁned by

T◦(I, ξ) = {(u, t, η) ∈ P◦ : 0 < t < |I |, |u − c(I )| < |I | − t, |η − ξ| ≤ gt −1},
T◦

ℓ(I, ξ) = {(u, t, η) ∈ T◦(I, ξ) : t|ξ − η| > b}.

DOMINATION OF MULTILINEAR SINGULAR INTEGRALS

We use the superscript ◦ to distinguish discrete trees T with top data (IT, ξT) from continu-
ous tents T◦ with same top data (IT, ξT). It will also be convenient to use the notation

T◦(I ) = {(u, t, η) ∈ P◦ : 0 < t < |I |, |u − c(I )| < |I | − t, }

for the projection of T◦(I, ξ) on the ﬁrst two components.

An outer measure µ◦ on P◦, with

as generating collection is then deﬁned via the premeasure σ(T◦(I, ξ)) = |I |. For F : Z → C
Borel measurable, we deﬁne the size

Denoting by L p(P◦, σ, s◦), L p,∞(P◦, σ, s◦) the corresponding strong and weak outer L p spaces,
we turn to the reformulation of the main result of [5]. A family of Schwartz functions

Φ := {φu,t,η : (u, t, η) ∈ P◦}

is said to be an adapted system with adaptation constants AN if

(4.8)

we have the following continuous parameter version of Proposition 4.1.

Proposition 4.2. [5, Theorem 1] Let Q ⊂ R be a dyadic interval and f be a Schwartz
function. For any 1 < p < 2, q > p′ there exists N = N (p, q) and K = K(p, q) such that

Remark 4.3. The above proposition is obtained by choosing λ = |Q|− 1
in [5, Theorem
1]. There are, however, two minor discrepancies between the result of [5] and the one
recalled above. The ﬁrst one is that, in deﬁnition (4.7), the intervals IM1 f ,p,Q are used
in place of I f ,p,Q. This change is necessary in order to perform a reduction argument to
compact support in η of F ◦( f ) see [5, Section 7.3.1], and can thus be avoided in the setup
of Proposition 4.2 since the parameter η is already in a compact interval. The second
difference is that the adapted family Φ used in [5] to deﬁne the wave packet transform

p

12

AMALIA CULIUC, FRANCESCO DI PLINIO, AND YUMENG OU

is obtained by applying dilation, translation and modulation symmetries to a ﬁxed mother
wave packet. However, the arguments of [5] adapt naturally to the more general transform
obtained from (4.6). We leave the details for the interested reader.

4.1.2. Transference. For each P ∈ P deﬁne

P ◦ :=(u, t, η) ∈ P◦ : |IP | ≤ t ≤ 2|IP |, u ∈ IP , η ∈ ωP .

Up to possibly splitting P into ﬁnitely many subcollections the sets {P ◦ : P ∈ P} are pairwise
disjoint subsets of P◦. Furthermore, the dudtdη-measure of P ◦ is comparable to |IP | up to
a constant factor. Let f be a ﬁxed Schwartz function and {φPj
: P ∈ P} be chosen such that

F j( f )(P) ≤ 2|〈 f , φPj

5. PROOF OF THEOREM 5

Now we are ready to prove Theorem 5, to which Theorem 2 has been reduced. Since for
any open admissible tuple ~r there exists an open admissible tuple ~p with max{p j} < 2 and
p j ≤ r j, it sufﬁces to prove the case max{p j} < 2. Such a tuple ~p is ﬁxed from now on.

5.1. Construction of the sparse collection. Let f j ∈ L p j (R), j = 1, 2, 3, be three compactly
supported functions and D be a dyadic grid. For all Q ∈ D, referring to the notation (4.1)
for I f ,p,Q we may then deﬁne

(5.1)

I ~f ,~p,Q := maximal elements of

I f j ,p j,Q

3[j=1

It is clear that the intervals I ∈ I ~f ,~p,Q are pairwise disjoint and that

(5.2)

XI ∈I ~f ,~p,Q

.

Furthermore, as a consequence of (4.3) for each f = f j, p = p j, there holds

(5.3)

inf
x∈3I

Mp j

f j(x ) ® 〈 f 〉3Q,p

∀I ∈ I ~f ,~p,Q, j = 1, 2, 3.

We now put together these stopping intervals in a single sparse collection S = S(D, f1, f2, f3)
of stopping intervals for the condition (4.1). Let us begin by choosing a partition of R by
intervals {Q k ∈ D : k ∈ N} with the property that supp f j ⊂ 3Q k for all j = 1, 2, 3 and k ∈ N.
For each k, let

S(Q k) =

Sℓ(Q k)

∞[ℓ=0

where S0(Q k) = {Q k} and, proceeding iteratively,

Sℓ(Q k) = [Q∈Sℓ−1(Qk )

I ~f ,~p,Q,

l = 1, 2, . . .

Finally, deﬁne

S = S(D, f1, f2, f3) =

S(Q k).

∞[k=0

By construction and by the packing property (5.2), S is a 1
2

-sparse subcollection of D.

5.2. Reduction to a single shifted dyadic grid. It is convenient to reduce to a canonical
choice of dyadic grids, as follows. Let

D j =2k[0, 1) +n + j

3 2k : k, n ∈ Z ,

j = 0, 1, 2

be the three canonical shifted dyadic grids on R. Recall the well known fact that for all
intervals I ⊂ R there exists a unique ˜I ∈ D0 ∪ D1 ∪ D2 with 3I ⊂ ˜I, |˜I | ≤ 6 · |3I |, and c(˜I ) is
least possible. We say that I has type j ∈ {0, 1, 2} if ˜I ∈ D j.

Fix a ﬁnite rank 1 collection P and a tuple of functions ~f = ( f1, f2, f3) as above. We split
P = P0 ∪ P1 ∪ P2 where P j = {P ∈ P : IP has type j}. For each j ∈ {0, 1, 2} we use the

previous construction with D = D j to obtain a 1

5.3. Proof of (5.4): main argument. A ﬁrst observation is that, since the intervals IP and

IP are comparable, and in view of the maximal deﬁnition of the tritile maps, there is no loss
in generality in what follows to assume IP = IP for all P ∈ P j, that is {IP : P ∈ P} ⊂ D j. In

fact, we are free to work with j = 0 and accordingly forgo the subscript j till the end of this
section.

The main step of the argument for Theorem 2 is summarized in the next lemma, whose
proof is postponed to the next subsection. Before the statement, it is convenient to recall
the notation

P≤(Q) := {P ∈ P : IP ⊂ Q}

associated to a generic ﬁnite collection of tritiles P. Let {Q k : k ∈ N} be the intervals
employed in the construction of S in Subsection 5.1. Since {Q k : k ∈ N} partition R, we
have the splitting

P =

P≤(Q k);

∞[k=0

in fact the union is ﬁnite, as the collection P is. Since S = ∪kS(Q k), (5.4) is a consequence
of

(5.5)

ΛP≤(Qk )( f1, f2, f3) = KAN XQ∈S(Qk )

|3Q|

3Yj=1

〈 f j〉3Q,p j

.

Estimate (5.5) is obtained by iteration of the lemma below, starting with Q = Q k, which
is legitimate because supp f j ⊂ 3Q k for any j = 1, 2, 3, and following the construction of
S(Q k).

Indeed, since ~p is open admissible and max{p j} < 2, using Proposition 4.1 we learn that
there exists a Hölder tuple ~q such that F j has the (LCq j ,p j

Let G j(P) := F j( f j)(P)1G ~f ,~p,Q

Among the 23 forms on the right hand side, the one corresponding with ~t such that t j = in

for us to bound the rest of the 23 − 1 forms. According to Proposition 5.2, which we state

5.5. Handling the tail terms. Now we proceed with the proposition that has been used in
the proof of Lemma 5.2 to estimate the tail term. In fact, we are going to derive it in a more

6. PROOF OF THEOREM 3 AND COROLLARY 4

6.1. Proof of Theorem 3. Fixing a tuple ~q = (q1, q2, q3) and weights ~v = (v1, v2, v3) as in
the statement of the theorem, and any open admissible tuple ~p with p j < q j for j = 1, 2, 3,
proving the theorem amounts to showing that

m (cid:12)(cid:12)Λm( f1, f2, f3)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ K(~p,~q, ~v)

3Yj=1

k f jkLq j (vj )

where K(~p,~q, ~v) is the constant appearing in the statement of the theorem, holds for all
tuples ~f = ( f1, f2, f3) ∈ C∞(R)3. We deﬁne

w j = vj

p j

j = 1, 2, 3.

Note that the ﬁniteness of the A~p

notices that k f jkLq j (vj ) = kg jkLq j (w j ). Applying the domination result from Theorem 2, we
bound the left hand side of (6.1) by

Therefore, (6.1) will follow from the estimate of the lemma below.

and using the disjointness of EQ and Hölder’s inequality, we estimate the remaining part of

The claimed estimate then follows by bookkeeping the last three observations and by rely-
ing upon the Lq j (w j)-boundedness of Mp j ,w j

( f j). The proof of the lemma is complete.

6.2. Proof of Corollary 4. First of all, we use the openness of the Aq and RHα classes and
the equivalence [4]

ws ∈ Aq ⇐⇒ w ∈ A q+s−1

to ﬁnd ǫ > 0 such that

where Q is a positive increasing function of its argument. We denote by q3 the dual expo-
nent of r and by v3 = u1−q3
the dual weight. We will prove the corollary by ﬁnding an open
admissible tuple ~p with p j < q j such that

and subsequently applying Theorem 3, which is made possible by (6.3).

Referring to the notation of (1.7), let ~p be an open admissible tuple with p j < q j and

ǫ = ǫ(~p). We set δ = 1 + ǫ and reparametrize
