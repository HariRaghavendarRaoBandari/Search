STABILITY OF GLOBAL EQUILIBRIUM FOR THE

MULTI-SPECIES BOLTZMANN EQUATION IN L∞ SETTINGS

MARC BRIANT

Abstract. We prove the stability of global equilibrium in a multi-species mix-
ture, where the diﬀerent species can have diﬀerent masses, on the 3-dimensional
torus. We establish stability estimates in L∞
x,v(w) where w = w(v) is either poly-
nomial or exponential, with explicit threshold. Along the way we extend recent
estimates and stability results for the mono-species Boltzmann operator not only
to the multi-species case but also to more general hard potential and Maxwellian
kernels.

Keywords: Multi-species mixture; Boltzmann equation; Perturbative theory;

Stability in L∞; Exponential trend to equilibrium.

1. Introduction

The multi-species Boltzmann equation rules the dynamics of a dilute gas composed
of N diﬀerent species of chemically non-reacting mono-atomic particles. More pre-
cisely, this equation describes the time evolution of Fi(t, x, v), the distribution of
particles of the ith species in position and velocity, starting from an initial distribu-
tion. It can be modeled by the following system of Boltzmann equations, stated on
R+ × T3 × R3,

(1.1)

∀ 1 6 i 6 N,

∂tFi(t, x, v) + v · ∇xFi(t, x, v) = Qi(F)(t, x, v)

with initial data

∀ 1 6 i 6 N, ∀(x, v) ∈ T3 × R3, Fi(0, x, v) = F0,i(x, v).

Note that the distribution function of the system is given by the vector F =
(F1, . . . , FN ).

The Boltzmann operator Q(F) = (Q1(F), . . . , QN (F)) is given for all i by

N

Qi(F) =

Qij(Fi, Fj),

where Qij describes interactions between particles of either the same (i = j) or of
diﬀerent (i 6= j) species and is local in time and space.

These expressions are a way to express the fact that collisions happening inside the
gas are only binary and elastic. Physically, it means that v′ and v′
∗ are the velocities
of two molecules of species i and j before collision giving post-collisional velocities
v and v∗ respectively, with conservation of momentum and kinetic energy:

The collision kernels Bij encode the physics of the interaction between two par-
ticles. We mention at this point that one can derive this type of equations from
Newtonian mechanics at least formally in the case of single species [8][9]. The rigor-
ous validity of the mono-species Boltzmann equation from Newtonian laws is known
for short times (Landford’s theorem [15] and, more recently, [12][16]).

1.1. Global equilibrium, stability and the perturbative regime. It is now
well known [11][10][4] that the symmetries of the collision operator imply the con-
servation of the total number density c∞,i of each species, of the total momentum of
the gas ρ∞u∞ and its total energy 3ρ∞θ∞/2:

i=1 mic∞,i is the global density of the gas. These expressions already
show that there exist non-trivial interactions between each species and the mixture,
unlike independent single-species Boltzmann equations that preserve the momentum
and energy of each of the species independently.

The operator Q = (Q1, . . . , QN ) also satisﬁes a multi-species version of the clas-
sical H-theorem [11] from which one deduces that there exists a unique global
equilibrium, i.e. a stationary solution F to (1.1), associated to the initial data
F0(x, v) = (F0,1, . . . , F0,N ). It is given by the global Maxwellian

∀ 1 6 i 6 N, Fi(t, x, v) = Fi(v) = c∞,i(cid:18) mi
By translating and rescaling the coordinate system we can always assume that u∞ =
0 and kBθ∞ = 1 so that the only global equilibrium is the normalized Maxwellian

Recently, E. Daus and the author [6] solved the existence and uniqueness problem
for the multi-species Boltzmann equation (1.1) around the global equilibrium µ
in L1
vL∞x (1 + |v|k) for k larger than an explicit threshold. They also proved the
stability of µ by showing the exponential decay in time of F(t) − µ as long as one
starts suﬃcently close to the global equilibrium.
The aim of the present article is to obtain similar results in L∞x,v settings. More
precisely we are interested in the exponential trend to equilibrium in L∞x,v with
polynomial or stretched exponential weights, thus proving the stability of µ.
In
other terms we study the existence, uniqueness and exponential decay of solutions
of the form Fi(t, x, v) = µi(v) + fi(t, x, v) for all i when one starts close to µ. This
is equivalent to solving the perturbed multi-species Boltzmann system of equations

(1.5)

∂tf + v · ∇xf = L(f) + Q(f),

or equivalently in the non-vectorial form

∀ 1 6 i 6 N,

∂tfi + v · ∇xfi = Li(f) + Qi(f),

where f = (f1, . . . , fN ) and the operator L = (L1, . . . , LN ) is the linear Boltzmann
operator given for all 1 6 i 6 N by

Li(f) =

Lij(fi, fj) with Lij(fi, fj) = Qij(µi, fj) + Qij(fi, µj).

If the mono-species Boltzmann equation has been extensively studied in the per-
turbative context (we refer to the discussion in [6] and the exhaustive review [17]),
the only result in our knowledge of a Cauchy theory for the multi-species case is [6].
We however mention the existing works [3][4], where they studied the diﬀusive limit
of the linear part of (1.5), [10], where they obtained an explicit spectral gap for the
linear operator L, and ﬁnally [11] where they derived the multi-species H-theorem
and dealt with the case of chimically reacting species.

MARC BRIANT

The main strategy of the present work is an analytic and non-linear adaptation
of a recent extension result for semigroups [14] that has also been used in [6] in a
diﬀerent setting. In a nutshell, we decompose the linear operator as L = −ν +A+B
where ν is a positive multiplication operator, A has some regularising properties and
B acts like a “small perturbation” of ν and decompose our full equation (1.5) into
a system of diﬀerential equations for f1 + f2 = f

∂tf1 + v · ∇xf1 = −ν(v)f1 + B (f1) + Q(f1 + f2)
∂tf2 + v · ∇xf2 = L(f2) + A(f1).

The key contribution of this article is a generalisation of the control of the operator B
in weighted L∞x,v. This operator was estimated in [14] in the case of mono-species with
hard spheres. We extend the result not only to multi-species but above all to hard
potential and Maxwellian kernels (see rigorous deﬁnition below). The possibility of
having diﬀerent masses is an intricate computational extension whereas the non hard
spheres case brings new diﬃculties and new behaviours for small relative velocities.
We conclude by emphasizing that our result includes the case of mono-species
Boltzmann equation recently obtained [14] and extend them to more general kernels.

1.2. Main result and organisation of the paper. We start with some conven-
tions and notations.

First, to avoid any confusion, vectors and vector-valued operators in RN will be
denoted by a bold symbol, whereas their components by the same indexed symbol.
For instance, W represents the vector or vector-valued operator (W1, . . . , WN ). We
shall use the following shorthand notation

hvi =q1 + |v|2.

The convention we choose for functional spaces is to index the space by the name
of the concerned variable, so we have for p in [1, +∞]

Lp
[0,T ] = Lp ([0, T ]) , Lp

t = Lp(cid:0)R+(cid:1) , Lp

x = Lp(cid:0)T3(cid:1) , Lp

v = Lp(cid:0)R3(cid:1) .

At last, for W = (W1, . . . , WN ) : R3 −→ R+ a strictly positive measurable function
in v, we will use the following vector-valued weighted Lebesgue spaces deﬁned by
their norms

kfkL∞x,v(W) =

N

Xi=1

kfikL∞x,v(Wi) where

kfikL∞x,v(Wi) =

sup

(x,v)∈T3×R3(cid:0)|fi(x, v)| Wi(v)(cid:1).

We will use the following assumptions on the collision kernels Bij. Note that there

were the assumptions also made in [6].
(H1) The following symmetry holds

Bij(|v − v∗|, cos θ) = Bji(|v − v∗|, cos θ)

for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ N.

(H2) The collision kernels decompose into the product
Bij(|v − v∗|, cos θ) = Φij(|v − v∗|)bij(cos θ),

1 ≤ i, j ≤ N,

STABILITY FOR THE MULTI-SPECIES BOLTZMANN EQUATION IN L∞ SETTINGS

5

where the functions Φij ≥ 0 are called kinetic part and bij ≥ 0 angular part.
This is a common assumption as it is technically more convenient and also
covers a wide range of physical applications.

(H3) The kinetic part has the form of hard or Maxwellian (γ = 0) potentials, i.e.

Φij(|v − v∗|) = C Φ

ij|v − v∗|γ, C Φ

ij > 0, γ ∈ [0, 1],

∀ 1 6 i, j 6 N.

(H4) For the angular part, we assume a strong form of Grad’s angular cutoﬀ (ﬁrst
introduced in [13]), that is: there exist constants Cb1, Cb2 > 0 such that for
all 1 ≤ i, j ≤ N and θ ∈ [0, π],

0 < bij(cos θ) ≤ Cb1| sin θ| | cos θ|,

b′ij(cos θ) ≤ Cb2.

Furthermore,

C b := min
1≤i≤N

inf

σ1,σ2∈S2ZS2

min(cid:8)bii(σ1 · σ3), bii(σ2 · σ3)(cid:9) dσ3 > 0.

We emphasize here that the important cases of Maxwellian molecules (γ = 0 and
b = 1) and of hard spheres (γ = b = 1) are included in our study. We shall use the
standard shorthand notations

(1.7)

b∞ij = kbijkL∞[−1,1]

and lbij = kb ◦ coskL1

S2

.

Under these assumptions we shall prove the following theorem.

Theorem 1.1. Let the collision kernels Bij satisfy assumptions (H1) − (H4) and
let wi = eκ1(√mi|v|)κ2 with κ1 > 0 and κ2 in (0, 2) or wi = h√mivik with k > k0 where
k0 is the minimal integer such that

Then there exist ηw, Cw and λw > 0 such that for any F0 = µ + f0 > 0 satisfying
the conservation of mass, momentum and energy (1.3) with u∞ = 0 and θ∞ = 1, if

kF0 − µkL∞x,v(w) 6 ηw

then there exists a unique solution F = µ + f in L∞x,v(w) to the multi-species Boltz-
mann equation (1.1) with initial data f0. Moreover, F is non-negative, satisﬁes the
conservation laws and
∀t > 0,

kF − µkL∞x,v(w) 6 Cwe−λwt kF0 − µkL∞x,v(w) .

The constants are explicit and only depend on N, w, the diﬀerent masses mi and
the collision kernels.

Remark 1.2. We make a few comments about the theorem above.

(1) As mentioned in the introduction the above Theorem has been proved in
vL∞x (1 + |v|k) ⊃ L∞x,v(w) in [6]. We therefore do not need to tackle the
L1
issue of existence or uniqueness and are only left with proving the a priori
stability of µ in the considered spaces.

MARC BRIANT

(2) Unlike the classical mono-species Boltzmann equation, the natural weights
for the multi-species case strongly depend on the mass of each species. As we
shall see, this will balance the cross-interactions generated inside the mixture.
(3) We emphasize here that the result still holds for any other global equilibrium
M(ci,∞, u∞, θ∞) and also that the uniqueness has only been obtained in a
perturbative regime, that is among the solutions written under the form F =
µ + f [6] with small f.

(4) In the case of identical masses and hard sphere collision kernels (γ = b = 1)
we recover the threshold k0 which has recently been obtained in the mono-
species case [14].

2. Decomposition of the linear operator and toolbox

As noticed in [14, Section 4] for the mono-species Boltzmann linear operator and
extended in [6, Section 6] for the multi-species case, the linear operator L can be
decompose into a regularizing operator and a “small perturbation” of the collision
frequency ν, where ν is a multiplicative operator deﬁned by

(2.1)

with

νi(v) =

νij(v),

N

Xj=1

νij(v) = C Φ

bij (cos θ)|v − v∗|γ µj(v∗) dσdv∗.

Each of the νij could be seen as the collision frequency ν(v) of a single-species
Boltzmann kernel with kernel Bij. It is well-known (for instance [8][9][18][14]) that
under our assumptions: νij(v) ∼ hviγ. We can be more explicit by making the
change of variable v∗ 7→ √mjv∗

νij(v) =

We shall use the decomposition derived in [6], that we recall now.

For δ in (0, 1), we consider Θδ = Θδ(v, v∗, σ) in C∞ that is bounded by one

everywhere, is exactly one on the set

and whose support is included in

(cid:8)|v| 6 δ−1
(cid:8)|v| 6 2δ−1

We deﬁne the splitting

and

|cos θ| 6 1 − 2δ(cid:9)

We have the following regularizing eﬀect for A(δ).

Lemma 2.1. Let wi = eκ1(√mi|v|)κ2 with κ1 > 0 and κ2 in (0, 2) or wi = h√mivik
with k > 5 + γ. Then for any β > 0 and δ in (0, 1), there exists CA > 0 such that
for all f in L∞x,v(w)

The constant CA is constructive and only depends on k, β, δ, N and the collision
kernels.

(cid:13)(cid:13)A(δ) (f)(cid:13)(cid:13)L∞x,v(hviβ µ−1/2) 6 CA kfkL∞x,v(w) .

Proof of Lemma 2.1. The operator A(δ) can be written as a kernel operator where
the kernels k(i),(δ)

are of compact support (see [6, Lemma 6.2]):

∀ i ∈ {1, . . . , N} , A(δ)

The desired estimate is therefore straightforward.

(cid:3)

The estimate on B(δ) is more delicate as it requires sharp estimates. Before de-
scribing the control on this operator, we need a technical lemma that gives a ﬁrst
estimate of the collision operator when applied to radially symmetric functions. Note
that this result is an extension of [14, Lemma 4.6] (proved in the case of hard spheres
γ = b = 1) not only to the multi-species framework but also to more general kernels.

The proof of Lemma 2.2 is technical and closely follows the one of [14, Lemma
4.6]. We therefore leave it in Appendix A for the sake of completeness and also
because the case mi 6= mj has to be handled carefully as we need to track down the
constants precisely.
The previous lemma can be directly use to obtain a control on the full non-linear
operator. This is a well-known result for the mono-species Boltzmann equation that
the control on the non-linear operator implies a loss of weight ν(v) in the case of a
polynomial weight and ν(v)1−c, with c > 0, in the exponential case (see for instance
[14, Lemma 5.16]). We prove here a similar result for the multi-species operator.

Lemma 2.3. Let wi = eκ1(√mi|v|)κ2 with κ1 > 0 and κ2 in (0, 2) or wi = h√mivik

with k > 5 + γ, there exists CQ > 0 such that for every f

kQi(f, g)kL∞x,v(cid:16)wiν−1+c(w)

i

(cid:17) 6 CQ kfkL∞x,v(w) kgkL∞x,v(w) ,

The constant CQ is explicit and depends only on w, N, the masses mi and the kernels
of the collision operator. The power c(w) is zero when w is polynomial and can be
taken equal to κ′2/γ for any 0 6 κ′2 < κ2 for w exponential.

Proof of Lemma 2.3. We remind the deﬁnition

Qi(f, g) =

Qij(fi, gj).

N

Xj=1

It is therefore enough to prove the estimate for Qij(fi, gj).

Firstly, since the collision kernels satisfy the Grad’s cutoﬀ assumption we can

decompose Qij into a loss and a gain term as

with Q+

ij has been deﬁned in Lemma 2.2 and

Qij(fi, gj) = C Φ

ij(cid:2)Q+

ij(fi, gj) − Q−ij(fi, gj)(cid:3)

Q−ij(fi, gj)(v) =(cid:18)ZR3×S2 |v − v∗|γ bij(cos θ)g∗j dσdv∗(cid:19) fi(v).

In this proof we will denote by C any positive constant independent of f, g and v.
We shall bound the gain and the loss terms separately.

Step 1: Estimate on the loss part. This operator can be controlled rather

easily. Indeed,

To conclude the estimate on the loss term, we bound |v − v∗|γ by hviγhv∗iγ and we
remind that hviγ 6 Cνi(v). The remaining integral in v∗ is ﬁnite due to the weights
wj(v∗) considered here.

|v′| > pmj/(2mi)|v∗| or |v′
also that w(|v|) > 1 it follows that the following always holds

We conclude this section with an explicit control for the operator B(δ).

Lemma 2.4. Let wi = eκ1(√mi|v|)κ2 with κ1 > 0 and κ2 in (0, 2) or wi = h√mivik
with k > k0. Take δ be in (0, 1). Then for all f in L∞x,v (wν) and all i in {1, . . . , N},

Moreover we have the following formula

CB(w, δ) = CB(w) + εw(δ)

where εw(δ) is an explicit function depending on w that tends to 0 as δ tends to 0

Remark 2.5. We emphasize here that, by deﬁnition of k0 given by (1.8), for every
choice of weight w considered in this work one has CB(w) < 1. We can thus ﬁx δ0
small enough such that for all δ 6 δ0, CB = CB(w, δ) < 1. In the rest of this article
we will assume that we chose δ 6 δ0 and for convenience we will drop the exponent
and use the following notations: B = B(δ), A = A(δ) and ﬁnally CB = CB(w, δ).

Proof of Lemma 2.4. Following the idea of [14] for the mono-species case in the hard
spheres model we split the operator B(δ)

in the form of f = f1 + f2. We look for f1 in L∞x,v (w) and f2 in L∞x,v(cid:0)hviβ

and f1(0, x, v) = f0(x, v),

2.5.

[6, Theorem 2.2] shows that there exists η > 0 such that if kf0kL1

a given n > 2 then there exists a unique solution f to the multi-species Boltzmann
vL∞x (cid:0)hvik(cid:1) with f0 as initial datum and satisfying the conservation
equation (3.1) in L1
of mass, momentum and energy. Our choice of weight w implies
kf0kL1

vL∞x (hvin) 6(cid:18)ZR3
and thus L∞x,v (w) ⊂ L1
vL∞x (hvin) for n in (2, 3). Therefore we can use the existence
and uniqueness result of [6, Theorem 2.2] to obtain a unique solution f to (3.1) in
L1
vL∞x (hvin) if kf0kL∞x,v(w) is suﬃciently small.
Moreover, [6, Section 6] showed existence and uniqueness of (f1, f2) such that
(f1+f2) satisﬁes the conservation of mass, momentum and energy. More precisely, [6,
Propositions 6.6 and 6.7] and the control (3.4) shows that if kf0kL∞x,v(w) is suﬃciently
small then there exist a unique f1 in L1
vL∞x (hvin) solution to (3.2) and a unique
µ−1/2(cid:1) and satisﬁes the following exponential decay

(3.4)

(3.5)

The constants C2 and λ2 are constructive.

As a conclusion, the proof of Theorem 1.1 will follow directly if we can prove that
f1 is indeed in L∞x,v(w) and decays exponentially. Thus, it is a consequence of the
following proposition.

Proposition 3.1. Let wi = eκ1(√mi|v|)κ2 with κ1 > 0 and κ2 in (0, 2) or w = h√mivik
with k > k0. Let f0 be in L∞x,v (w). There exist η1, λ1 > 0 such that if

kf0kL∞x,v(w) 6 η1

then the function f1 solution to (3.2) is in L∞x,v (w) and satisﬁes
kf1(t)kL∞x,v(w) 6 e−λ1t kf0kL∞x,v(w) .

∀t > 0,

The constants η1 and λ1 are constructive and only depends on N, w and the collision
kernel.

Unlike the case of L1

vL∞x (hvin) [6, Proposition 6.6], the proof of the exponential
decay in L∞x,v(w) cannot be treated by a direct Gr¨onwall lemma. We therefore adapt
a method developed in [5] and improved in [7] that relies on a Duhamel formula
along the characteristic trajectories for f1.

16

MARC BRIANT

Proof of Proposition 3.1. Since f1 is solution to (3.2) we can write each of its com-
ponents under their implicit Duhamel form along the characteristics. As the space
variable lives on the torus, these trajectories are straight lines with velocity v. We
thus have the following equality for almost every (x, v) in T3 × R3 and for every i in

We would like to bound wi(v)f1i(t, x, v) in x and v and we therefore bound each of
the three terms on the right-hand side.

Since νi(v) > ν0 > 0 for all i and v we have the following bound

We can now conclude by choosing ε and f0 suﬃciently small. Indeed, ﬁrst CB < 1
(see Remark 2.5 so we can choose CB < 1 − ε and thus CB/(1 − ε) < 1. Second,
the exponential decay of f2 given by (3.5) also implies that eεν0s kf2(s)kL∞x,v(w) 6

yields

Appendix A. Proof of Lemma 2.2

We will denote by δd the dirac distribution in dimension d. First of all, one has the
following rewriting (see [1, equation (3.6)] or [2, Lemma 1] or [14, equation (4.20)])

Then, by deﬁnition we have

does not depend on σ in S2 and A(a1, a2, a3, a4) is invariant under permutations of
the variables (a1, a2, a3, a4). Moreover, [14] also proved that for a1 > a2 > a3 > a4
one has

A(a1, a2, a3, a4) =

8π2

(a4 + a3 − max{(a1 − a2), (a3 − a4)}) .
