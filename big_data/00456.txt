We present the preliminary results of an ongoing series of spectroscopic observations of the
Small Magellanic Cloud star LHA 115-S 18 (S18), which has demonstrated extreme photospheric
and spectroscopic variability that, in some respects, is reminiscent of Luminous Blue Variables
(LBVs). In contrast to our previously published results, between 2012–2015 S18 remained in an
spectral state intermediate between S18’s “hot” and “cool” extremes. In conjunction with con-
temporaneous OGLE–IV photometric monitoring of S18, these data will be used to determine the
characteristic timescale of the variability and search for periodicities, in particular binary modu-
lated periodicity. We also present the results of a pilot study of the LMC star LHA 120-S 134.

1. Introduction

LHA 115-S 18 (S18) is a supergiant (sg) B[e] star in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC).
Properties of stars exhibiting the B[e] phenomenon include strong Balmer emission lines, the pres-
ence of forbidden emission lines in their optical spectra and a large infrared (IR) excess. These are
attributed to an extended circumstellar torus, with the IR excess originating from hot dust. Zickgraf
et al. (1985, 1986) [1, 2] propose a two component stellar wind model to explain the optical spectra
of sgB[e] stars in the Magellanic Clouds. The canonical model consists of a dense equatorial wind
or torus exhibiting a low outﬂow velocity and a radiation driven wind in the polar region, indistin-
guishable from that of a normal supergiant (see Figure 1). We note here that, whilst the description
above sounds similar to that of normal Be stars, the circumstellar environment of sgB[e] stars is
dense enough to permit the formation/survival of dust. X–ray observations indicate that S18 is ’X–
ray bright’, i.e. its X–ray luminosity is an order of magnitude greater than expected for a massive
single star of its bolometric luminosity (Antoniou et al. 2009 [3]; Clark et al. 2013 [4]; Bartlett et
al. in prep.). Binarity is typically invoked to explain such behaviour, with the excess high energy
emission either arising via shocks in a colliding wind binary, in which the secondary is a massive
star, or via accretion onto a compact companion.

In recent years it has become apparent that the majority (>70%) of the most massive stars do
not exist in isolation but form and evolve in binary systems (Sana et al. 2012 [5]). The interactions
between the two companions have a profound affect on their evolution and, in turn, have important
implications for other areas of astrophysics. There’s mounting support for the idea that B[e] stars
represent either interacting or newly formed, post–interaction binary systems (Kastner et al. 2010
[6]). Identifying sgB[e] binaries is, therefore, a priority as their properties will help constrain the
physics of mass transfer.

There are very few known sgB[e] stars with X–ray emission: XTE J0421+560/CI Camelopard-

alis (CI Cam; e.g. Bartlett et al. 2013 [7]), IGR J16318-4848 (e.g. Barragán et al. 2009 [8]) and
Wd1-9 (Clark et al. 2013 [9]). The ﬁrst two sources are bona ﬁde High-Mass X–ray Binary
(HMXB) systems, the third source a colliding wind binary. The HMXB GX301-2 (e.g. Fürst et al.
2011 [10]), also gets an ‘honourary mention’ in the ﬁrst category – whilst the optical counterpart
is formally that of an early B-hypergiant and not a sgB[e] star (e.g. Clark et al. 2012 [11]),
this system shares many characteristics with CI Cam and IGR J16318-4848, including an infrared
excess attributed to circumstellar dust, a strong 6.4 keV Fe–Kα line and high absorbing column
(nH ∼ 1023 cm−2).

With the exception of Wd1-9, which resides in a well studied cluster, the distances to the
Galactic X–ray emitting sgB[e] stars are plagued with uncertainties, which in turn leads to uncer-
tainties in the source luminosity and thus the nature of the compact object. GX301-2 has clear
pulsations detected at ∼ 685 s, unequivocally indicating that the accretor is a neutron star, but no
spin periods have been detected thus far in CI Cam or IGR J16318-4848. In contrast, the distance
to the Magellanic Clouds are well constrained; any uncertainty as to the position of a source within
these galaxies is trivial in comparison with their distance. As such, the population of sgB[e] stars
in the Magellanic Clouds may be key to understanding these systems.

Figure 3: Spectra of S18 around the HeII in its cool state (2010), hot state (2011) and the apparent interme-
diate state seen in SALT spectra (taken 2014 July 22). The main spectral transitions are labelled. Whilst the
morphology of S18 is similar to that of a late type, Nitrogen-rich Wolf-Rayet (WNLh) star, the line emission
is far stronger than any known example.

Clark et al. (2013) [4] present an optical study of S18 based on a combination of ‘new’ and
archival spectroscopic data and the 16 year OGLE II–IV photometric curve (see Figure 2). The
authors show that, unlike normal sgB[e] stars which historically have been considered essentially
static, S18 is highly variable. Both photometric (∆m∼ 1.3mag) and spectroscopic variability (evo-
lution from a P Cygni to WN9h spectral types implying T∗ ∼ 19 → 28kK) occurs with unprece-
dented rapidity; e.g. the ∆m∼ 0.9mag brightening in only ∼50 days. Moreover the spectral and
photometric changes appear completely uncorrelated.

Only one other sgB[e] star in the Magellanic Clouds is detected in X–rays: The Large Magel-
lanic Cloud (LMC) star LHA 120-S 134 (S134, see Massey et al. 2014 [12]). Interestingly it is also
the only other known B[e] star Galaxy, SMC and LMC to show the broad feature around 4686Å
(Zickgraf et al. 1986 [2]).

To date observations of S18 been obtained on an ad hoc basis, resulting in a sparsely sampled,
heterogeneous, low resolution data set. No modern multi epoch study of S134 has been made. Here
we report our preliminary results of an ongoing Priority 4 SALT RSS monitoring campaign of S18,
as well as a pilot study of S134, initiated in Semester 1 of 2014.

archival spectra, taken in 2010 and 2011. In our previous data S18 was typically observed in either
a “hot” or “cool” extreme, but in our observations between 2014–2015 we found S18 occupied nei-
ther state, but rather demonstrated a spectral morphology intermediate between the two. Note the
evolution in the Balmer series from a P Cygni proﬁle to pure, stronger emission and the appearance
of NIII and HeII. Whilst the morphology of S18 is similar to that of a WNLh star, the line emission
is far stronger than any known example.

The data, along with SALT observations of a comprehensive sample of WN Wolf–Rayets
taken for comparison, indicate that the strength and the line widths in the high excitation lines in
S18 (HeII & NIII) are inconsistent with a simple blend of B supergiant and N–rich WR. Instead the
exciting radiation from the central engine (whether accretion or colliding wind binary) must ionise
the circumstellar torus and associated disc wind that it drives, yielding the composite emergent
spectrum.

The top panel of Figure 4 shows the HeII 4686Å region of the SALT spectra of S18, taken in
Semester 1 of 2014. The data reveal unprecedented variability, on day to day timescales, compared
with months to years from our previous monitoring. We also note the transient P Cygni proﬁle in
the HeI series e.g. 4710Å line.

2.1 S18 as a Luminous Blue Variable/Supernova Imposter

Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs) are thought to represent a short-lived phase of very massive
stellar evolution in which instabilities drive dramatic mass loss. They occupy the same region of
the H-R diagram as sgB[e] stars and appear to be the immediate progenitors of some of the most
luminous SNe known (e.g. SNe 2005gl and 2006tf; Gal-Yam et al. 2009 [13]; Smith et al. 2008
[14]). By virtue of its dramatic spectroscopic and photometric variability, S18 trivially satisﬁes
the eponymous classiﬁcation criteria of LBVs, but does not conform to their typical behaviour
(Humphreys & Davidson, 1994 [15]) and more closely resembles the SNe impostors SN2000ch
and SN2009ip.

The LBV/colliding wind binary HD 5980 – an obvious comparator to S18 – shows modulation
of its very strong HeII 4686Å line phased to the 19.3 day orbital period (e.g. Koenigsberger et al.
2010 [16]). Based on the short term variability in the HeII line in S18 revealed by SALT, one might
ask whether periodic modulation is present on a similarly short period and hence whether S18 is
also a compact colliding wind binary.

HeII 4686Å has yet to reach its historical maximum intensity during our SALT observations.
Intriguingly, η Carinae is a binary with a period of 5.54 years that, again, is delineated by variability
in the HeII 4686Å emission (Teodoro et al. 2012 [17]). Could comparable long term behaviour
also be present in S18, superimposed on the rapid line proﬁle variability? Extending this idea, the
SNe impostors that S18 resembles by virtue of its rapid photometric variability (e.g. SN2000ch
and SN2009ip) are both HeII 4686Å emitters that show dramatic outbursts separated by years of
quiescence.

3. S134

The bottom panel of Figure 4 shows a representative SALT spectrum of S134, taken in Semester
2 of 2014. Unlike S18, the overall strength of the HeII 4686Å remained roughly constant over the

∼ 3 month period of the observations, although we note that the line proﬁle is variable. However,
we recognise that several studies of S18 taken in isolation would also be consistent with a lack of
variability in this line.

We know far less about S134 than S18 due to the lack of long term monitoring, although
[NeIII], [SIII] and [SIV] emission in the mid-IR Kastner et al. (2010) [6] imply excitation tempera-
tures of >60kK; in conjunction with both X–ray and HeII 4686Å emission providing a compelling
case for binarity (Bartlett et al. in prep.). Our SALT observations of S134 and benchmarking WR
stars show that the spectrum of S134 is consistent with a composite blend providing a compelling
case for binarity as suggested by Massey et al.
(2014) [12]. Our SALT observations of S134
and benchmarking WR stars show that the spectrum of S134 is consistent with a composite blend
(Bartlett et al. in prep.)

4. Conclusions

Despite having many similarities (i.e. X–ray emission and broad emission feature at 4686Å)
our SALT observations of S18 and S134 thus far suggest that they are very different binary systems.
The HeII 4686Å line in the spectrum of S134 is consistent with us directly observing a WNL star
in the system, whereas the strength of this line in the spectrum of S18 precludes this. Along
with its rapid variability, the strength of this line suggest S18 has more in common with the SNe
impostors SN2000ch and SN2009ip. At the time of writing, we have neither the cadence nor
sufﬁcient observations to search for short or long term periodic modulation with our current data
set to link S18 with such systems.

Data obtained since this meeting indicates that S18 currently completely lacks HeII 4686Å
emission; a state only observed four times in the past 60 years. The inferred absence of high
energy exciting radiation means that we will be able to determine the quiescent outﬂow velocity
and mass loss rate from S18 via modelling of the P Cygni proﬁles of the Balmer lines, providing
a benchmark to investigate the effect of ionisation by the central (binary star?) engine as it turns
back on again.

More generally, this campaign highlights the power of SALT Priority 4 programs, that is,
programs undertaken in more marginal conditions that do not strictly require SALT’s aperture.
Even during P4 intervals, SALT can provide homogeneous spectra of unprecedented signal to noise
and resolution. During these observations we also serendipitously identiﬁed a rare LBV eruption
in our WN10h star (HDE 269582 == BAT99-45 == LHA 120-S 83), highlighting the utility of our
P4 proposal.
