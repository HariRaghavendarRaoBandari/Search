Abstract

The two dimensional one component plasma 2dOCP is a classical system consisting of N identical
particles with the same charge q conﬁned in a two dimensional surface with a neutralizing background.
The Boltzmann factor at temperature T may be expressed as a Vandermonde determinant to the power
Γ = q2/(kBT ). Several statistical properties of the 2dOCP have been studied by expanding the Boltz-
mann factor in the monomial basis for even values of Γ. In this work, we use this formalism to compute
the energy of the 2dOCP on a sphere. Using the same approach the entropy is computed. The entropy as
well as the free energy in the thermodynamic limit have a universal ﬁnite-size correction term χ
12 log N ,
where χ = 2 is the Euler characteristic of the sphere. A non-recursive formula for coeﬃcients of mono-
mial functions expansion is used for exploring the energy as well as structural properties for suﬃciently
large values of Γ to appreciate the crystallization features for N = 2, 3, . . . , 9 particles. Finally, we make
a brief comparison between the exact and numerical energies obtained with the Metropolis method for
even values of Γ.

1 Introduction

Coulomb systems, plasmas and electrolytes are systems of charged particles interacting according to the
Coulomb’s law. The One-Component Plasma (OCP) or jellium is the simplest model of a Coulomb system.
It is a set of N identical pointlike particles of charge q embedded in a neutralizing background. The pair
potential between particles is the solution of the Poisson equation. This solution is logarithmic for a system
in two dimensions. The only dimensionless coupling constant is Γ = q2/(kBT ) where kB is the Boltzmann
constant and T is the temperature. In general, a two dimensional OCP (2dOCP) with logarithmic interaction
does not describe real (three-dimensional) charged particles conﬁned on a surface because they interact with
the usual inverse power law potential. However, this logarithmic case has been widely studied because it
oﬀers analytic solutions on diverse geometries particularly for Γ = 2 [1, 2, 3, 4]. At the special coupling
Γ = 2 where the 2dOCP is in the ﬂuid phase the distribution functions may be found exactly. In particular,

1

the pair correlation function g(r) is reduced to a gaussian form exp(−πρr2) with ρ the density. Expansions
around Γ = 2 suggests that the pair correlation function changes from the exponential form to an oscillating
one for a region with Γ > 2. This behaviour of the pair correlation function as the coupling is stronger has
been observed in Monte Carlo simulations [10][13]. For suﬃcient high values of Γ (low temperatures) the
2dOCP begins to crystallize and there are several works where the freezing transition is found. For the case
of the sphere Caillol et al. [10] localized the coupling parameter for melting at Γ ≈ 140.
In the limit Γ → ∞ the 2dOCP becomes a Wigner crystal. In particular, the spatial conﬁguration of the
charges which minimizes the energy at zero temperature for the 2dOCP on a plane is the usual hexagonal
lattice. Nowadays, the corresponding Wigner crystal of the 2dOCP on sphere or Thomson problem may be
solved numerically [11] and the unsolved analytical problem has been included in the Smale’s list of problems
for the 21st century. Experimentally, the dusty plasmas are one of the ways to obtain a bidimensional
Coulomb system on the plane. A plasma is an ionised gas with a low ionisation degree range frequently
referred as the fourth state of matter. If the Coulomb interaction energy of the particles is much higher
than the individual kinetic energy, then the particles may arrange themselves in a lattice forming a crystal.
Diﬀerent research groups studied these plasma crystals in the laboratory during the nineties [14, 15] by
conﬁning particles of several micrometers on horizontal layers whose observation is made by illuminating such
plane with HeNe laser light. There are also experimental investigations on two-dimensional spherical crystals
which are formed in the surface of water droplets in oil where defects of the ideal crystal as disclinations and
dislocations are observed in the laboratory [12].
The main objective of this work is to make exact computations of the energy and the entropy of the
2dOCP on a sphere at Γ (cid:54)= 2 and reproduce the well known results at Γ = 2. Previously, a converging series
expansions of the truncated pair correlation function on the disk at Γ = 4 was described in [6]. For the case
of the sphere it is possible to implement an extension of the expansion Vandermonde determinant to the
power Γ techniques used in the analytical computation of the free energy presented in [7, 8]. The results of
those works give the free energy for ﬁxed values of the temperature, therefore it is not straightforward to
obtain the internal energy from those results. Nevertheless, in this work we will obtain the internal energy
by using the relation that expresses it in terms of the pair correlation function. Once the internal energy is
known, the entropy would be found straightforwardly from the free energy and the internal energy.

This document is organized as follows. In the next section a description of the system and main deﬁnitions
will be done. Previously, the authors of [8] were able to obtain the partition ZN,Γ and pair correlation
function ρ(2)(θ) constrained to the condition Γ = q2/(kBT ) = 2, 4, ..., 2n with n a positive integer for several
geometries including the sphere. We will use some of these results to compute the energy and entropy
under the same restriction over coupling parameter. Section 3 summarizes the basic technique behind the
computation of ZN,Γ and ρ(2)(θ) and deﬁnes the notation adopted until the end of the document. Sections
4 and 5 are devoted to describe the exact energy and entropy computations including a comparison with
simulation results obtained with the Metropolis method. The analytic method described in this document
is mostly based in the expansion of the Vandermonde determinant to the power Γ using the monomial
functions mµ(z1, . . . , zN ) as a basis where z1, . . . , zN are related with the particle’s positions and µ labels
each monomial function. Since the energy and entropy will be expressed as expansions over the symmetric and
antisymmetric monomial functions, then two-diﬀerent techniques for computing the expansions coeﬃcients
{C (N )
µ (Γ/2)} are included in the appendix section. The ﬁrst technique uses the multinomial expansion
theorem to ﬁnd these coeﬃcients. The second technique is based in the partial derivatives diﬀerentiation of
the Vandermonde determinant to the power Γ combined with the Finite Diﬀerence Method (FDM) in order
to obtain C (N )
µ (Γ/2). Both methods give the exact value of coeﬃcients including the one based on FDM
because it uses the fact that n-order ﬁnite diﬀerence of a polynomial of order n is exact.

2 System description

This work will be focused in the study of the 2dOCP on a sphere. It is a classical system of N particles
with charge q on a two dimensional surface with a neutralizing background ρb. The Coulomb interaction
potential ν((cid:126)r1, (cid:126)r2) between two particle located at (cid:126)r1 and (cid:126)r2 with respect the center of the sphere is

ν((cid:126)r1, (cid:126)r2) = − log

where L is an arbitrary parameter which deﬁnes the length scale. In this writing we will study the 2OCP
on a sphere. The excess energy Uexc of the 2OCP is given by

Uexc = Upp + Ubp + Ubb

where the integrations are over the sphere and ρ(2)((cid:126)r1, (cid:126)r2) is the two-point correlation function. Since the
partition function may be computed for even values of the coupling parameter and ρ(2)((cid:126)r1, (cid:126)r2) is found by
functional derivatives of the partition function, then it is possible to compute Eq. (2) and the excess energy.

It coincides with the result for the 2DOCP in the bulk in a plane obtained by B. Jancovici [4] who used a

4.2 Energy and pair correlation function for N = 2

If we consider the simple case of a pair of particles N = 2, then the partitions are of the form µ = (µ1, µ2)
where

µ1 = p, p + 1,··· , 2p and µ2 = p, p − 1,··· , 0

and p = Γ/4. The coeﬃcients are

µ (2p) = (−1)µ1
C (2)

(cid:18)2p

µ1

We also have included the derivation as a particular case for N = 2 of the method described in section
7.2 (see Eq. (45)) which is equivalent to apply the binomial theorem and the orthogonality condition of the
monomial functions on Eq. (5). In fact, the idea to use the binomial theorem to ﬁnd C (2)
µ (Γ/2) is not new.
The method described in section 7 is just a generalization of this idea with the aim to ﬁnd C (N )
µ (Γ/2) for
other values of N and Γ. Using these results for partitions and coeﬃcients, then the partition function given
by Eq. (12) takes the form

N,Γ =

around θ = π as Γ goes to inﬁnity as it is shown in Fig. 3.

4.3 Energy and pair correlation function for N = 3

The excess energy as well as the pair correlation function may be obtained explicitly because the coeﬃcients
for three particles with µ3 = 0 are related with the well known coeﬃcients for two particles without any
restriction on partitions. The partitions and coeﬃcients are given by

is the multiplicity. A plot of the pair correlation function of three particles is shown in Fig. 4. For values
of Γ near to 2 the function ρ(2)
N =3 is practically delocalized because of high thermal excitations. As the
temperature is decreased to zero Γ → ∞ the pair correlation function is concentrated around φ = 2π/3
radians obeying to the fact that particles crystallize in a equilateral triangle and the azimuthal symmetry of
the system.

The excess energy may be obtained by using Eqs. (18), (17), and (3) with the explicit values of partitions

4.4 Asymptotic energy for N ≤ 4
The Wigner crystals for N ≤ 4 at vanishing temperature play an special role because they are the only
equidistant conﬁgurations of the Thomson problem. Since the cases N = 2, N = 3 and N = 4 correspond
to the antipodal nodes, equilateral triangle and the tetrahedron conﬁgurations respectively, then we may
compute the energy of these conﬁgurations by replacing the particle positions in Eq. (1) and using Eq. (3).

4.5 Energy for N ≥ 4 with Γ > 2 and comparison with the Metropolis method

Previous works [10] showed that Monte Carlo simulations of 2dOCP are reliable for a wide range of
Γ ∈ [0.5, 200]. This section of the document is devoted to the implementation of the usual Metropolis
method in the modest situation of a few particles 2dOCP with the aim to do a comparison between the
Metropolis method and the exact results described in previous sections.
In order to implement the nu-
merical algorithm we chose randomly a particle located at (cid:126)r on the sphere, later the particle was moved
to (cid:126)r(cid:48) = ˆRx(γ) ˆRy(β) ˆRz(α)(cid:126)r where ˆRx, ˆRx and ˆRy are rotations around the x, y and z axis of the Carte-

exp (−βδUk) < M with M ∈ [0, 1] a random number. The position of the mobile charges on the 2dOCP
tends to be ﬁxed for large values of Γ (this is high electric coupling or low temperature) and the Metropolis
method generates the conﬁgurations shown in Fig. 8. These conﬁgurations are intimately related with the
pair correlation function (see Fig. 9) of Eq. (13). For the case N = 4 where particles are arranged in the
vertices of a tetrahedron and the pair correlation function is concentrated around θ = 109.4712o as Γ reaches
high values. For N = 5 and N = 6 the function ρ(2)
N is concentrated around θ = 180o because there are
diﬀerent ways to rotate the triangular dipyramid and the octahedron locating a particle in the north pole
and another one in the south pole. As we add more particles new peaks on ρ(2)
N may emerge in the strong
coupling regime revealing the crystal structure of the OCP. However, as N is increased, it becomes less
evident to appreciate a direct connection between the individual positions of the Wigner crystal and ρ(2)
N
because there are more candidates to occupy the north pole. We have also calculated the exact numerical
value of excess energy for Γ = 2, 4, . . . by using Eqs. (3) and (17). The excess energy tends to a constant
as Γ (cid:29) 2 as is shown in Fig. 7. Such constant corresponds to the minimal energy of the corresponding
Wigner crystal. Similarly, the excess energy per particle tends to a constant, say uΓ, as the number of par-
ticles is increased holding the density unchanged (see Fig. 6). Although, the value of uΓ has not been fully
determined analytically at the thermodynamic limit, it is interesting to notice that the excess energy per
N,Γ=2/N = u2 − q2/(8N ) + O(1/N 2).
In contrast, energy per particle seems to oscillate around uΓ as N increases for suﬃciently large values of
Γ. The particle-particle energy computation via Eq. (17) as well as the pair correlation function Eq. (13)
require the knowledge of C (N )
µ (Γ/2) and partitions included in the sum. In general, it may be computational
expensive even for moderate values of N or Γ because the number of coeﬃcients tends to increase quickly

particle at Γ = 2 tends to u2 = −q2(cid:2)log(ρπL2) + γ(cid:3) /4 according to U (exc)

with these parameters. Fortunately, there are several algorithm for the determination of the coeﬃcients
[16, 17, 18] including the methods described in the Appendices A and B. In particular, the approach of [18]
seems to be the most eﬃcient. The results for the excess energy are shown in Tables 3-10 of Appendix D,
illustrating how Uexc changes as Γ varies, for ﬁxed values of the number of particles.

Alternatively, in Table 11 of Appendix E, it is shown how the excess energy varies as N increases for
three ﬁxed values of Γ = 4, 6, 8. The data shown in that table is computed with Eq. (19) and ﬁtted to an
ansatz of the form

Uexc = q2(AN + B + C/N + D/N 2)

(29)

which allow us to estimate the bulk excess energy per particle (uΓ = Aq2) and its ﬁnite size corrections. In
particular, we obtain u4/q2 = −0.5138290, u6/q2 = −0.54990 and u8/q2 = −0.570. We have ﬁxed L = 1
and ρb = 1 in the numerical data.

In Ref. [9] it is argued that the free energy F of two-dimensional Coulomb systems in a sphere is expected

to have a ﬁnite-size expansion given by

βF = N C1 +

χ
12

ln N + C2 + O(1/N )

(30)

where χ = 2 is the Euler characteristic of the sphere. From the relation U = ∂(βF )/∂β we deduce that the
expected ﬁnite size expansion of Uexc should indeed be of the form (29). Notice the absence of a logarithmic
(ln N ) ﬁnite-size correction in the internal energy U as opposed to the one appearing in the free energy (30),
and in the entropy, which will be discussed in the following section.

Fig. 10: Entropy. (left) Excess entropy per particle. (right) Total entropy of the 2OCP for Γ = 2. The
asymptotic function of S/N (solid line) ﬁts with the exact values (squares) even for small values of N . The
entropy of the ideal gas Sideal in the sphere (dashed line) is bigger than S for N > 1.

χ

As a result, the total entropy, as well as the Helmholtz free energy, is a function of the form S = B1N +
12 log N + B2 + ··· , when N → ∞, where B1 and B2 are constants. Moreover, the excess entropy Sexc
kB
is negative for N > 2 and decreases linearly as N → ∞ as it is shown in Fig. 10-(left). However, the total
entropy remains positive but lower than the entropy of the ideal gas on the sphere 0 < S ≤ Sideal. It may
be attributed to the fact that several microstates look less probable as the gas is charged. For instance, the
situation where particles are too close is not too probable in the ideal gas, but the same situation is less
probable if the particles are equally charged. The number of accessible microstates should decrease when
the Coulomb interaction is introduced because there is less freedom to choose a conﬁguration holding the
total energy unchanged. The numerical exact values of the excess entropy for Γ ≥ 2 are shown in Fig. 11.
In the regime of large values of Γ the ideal gas entropy as well as the excess entropy take negative values
contradicting the third law of thermodynamics which establishes that entropy of a perfect crystal at absolute
temperature is zero. This problem is inherited from the classical treatment assumed in the study of 2dOCP
where the entropy diverges as T → 0 to minus inﬁnity suggesting that quantum treatment is necessary to
ﬁnd its value correctly in the strong coupling regime.

Concluding remarks

In this work an approach was described to compute exactly some thermodynamic properties of the 2dOCP
on the sphere for Γ ≥ 2 by expanding the Bolztmann factor in terms of monomial functions basis. The excess
energy was exactly computed for even values of Γ and N = 2, . . . , 9 particles obtaining a good agreement
with the numerical simulations implemented with the Metropolis Method. The analytical expression for the
excess entropy for even values of Γ was also obtained.
A pair of problems must be faced before computing the excess energy for N ≥ 4 with the approach
described in this document. The ﬁrst one is to ﬁnd the coeﬃcients C (N )
µ (Γ/2) included in the harmonic
numbers average Eq. (18) and the second one is due to the rapid growing of the total number of partitions
as the number of particles or the coupling parameter is increased. These problems are related with the
practical evaluation of the expansion but not with the analytical expressions because they do not have
restrictions with how large or cold the system is. A solution to the ﬁrst task was to ﬁnd a numerical method
which allows to obtain the coeﬃcients exactly. For this aim, we developed two diﬀerent techniques based in
the multinomial theorem and the diﬀerence method. They are alternatives to the numerical methods with
recursion relations between coeﬃcients. The number of terms of the expansions for the energy and other
thermodynamic variables grows specially with N but signiﬁcantly lower when Γ is increased. This feature
permit us to obtain numerical exact results far from Γ = 2 at least for a few number of particles ﬁnding a
stronger connection between the analytical pair correlation function and the structure of the Wigner crystals
as the coupling parameter becomes larger.

All partitions µ may be found from the ﬁrst one usually called the root partition µ1
have used the following notation for the elements µα
and Np(N, Γ) the total number of partitions. For N = 3 and Γ = 4 the partitions are shown in Table 1.
The partition elements are obtained by adding or subtracting integers to the previous partition elements
i as a constant. For instance, the second partition (4, 1, 1) may be obtained from
(4, 2, 0) by a subtraction of 1 from µ1
3. Similarly, the third partition (3, 3, 0) is obtained
from the ﬁrst partition by subtracting 1 from µ1
2. These type of operations are usually
referred as squeezing. Following the same rules, the 4th partition may be obtained from the third and the
1 = (N − 1)Γ/2 − j1(α),
5th from the 4th. Therefore, the partition elements for N = 3 are of the form µα
3 = (N − 1)Γ/2 + j2(α) where ji(α) are positive integers which
2 = (N − 1)Γ/2 + j1(α) − j2(α) and µα

The computation of coeﬃcients with Eq. (44) requires to ﬁnd the set Iµ previously deﬁned in Eq. (43).
it is necessary to solve a set of N -equations of the form Km((cid:126)i, σm) − µm = 0 with
In other words,
m = 1, . . . , N under N !-conditions of the form ij−1 − ij ≥ 0 with j = 1, . . . , N !, i0 = Γ/2 and iN ! = 0
where (cid:126)i = (i1, . . . , iN !−1) are unknowns. Therefore, the vector solution is not unique dim(Iµ) ≥ 1 and it is
possible to ﬁnd more than one vector (cid:126)i solution associated to a single partition µ which makes harder to ﬁnd

Here the set Iµ is found with the function Solve of Mathematica and the output is summarized in Ta-
ble 2. Taking into account that we usually have to compute the coeﬃcients of partitions with µN = 0, then
the technique described here may be used for the computation of the coeﬃcients for values of Γ far from

2. In fact, we have used Eq. (44) to ﬁnd C (N )
µ (Γ/2) for N = 2, 3, 4 and 5 with values of Γ = 4, 8, . . . , 100.
In some sense the program implementation of Eq. (44) may be simple, since the only diﬃculty is to built
Iµ. However, the construction of Iµ for large values of N is hard even numerically because it will require to
handle a set of N ! inequalities with N equations. Although, this feature makes impractical the use of this
technique even for N > 5, Eq. (44) provides a straightforward way to ﬁnd analytically C (N )
µ (Γ/2) for N = 2
and N = 3 for any even value of Γ when µN = 0.

The partitions are given by

and

µα

Γ

with α = 1, 2, . . . ,Np and Np = Γ/4 + 1 the total number of partitions. For N = 2 the vector (cid:126)i has only one

26

(cid:26)

component i1 and the Iµ set given by Eq. (43) takes the form

Iµ :=

i1 : K1(i1, σ1) = µ1 ∧ K2(i1, σ2) = µ2 with

≥ i1 ≥ 0 ∧ µ1 ≥ µ2 ≥ 0

Γ

(cid:27)

with (σp

.

The components of the K-vector are K1(i1, σ1) = i1 = µ1 and K2(i1, σ2) = Γ/2 − i1 = µ2. From both
conditions it is obtained the solution i1 = Γ/4 + (α − 1) = µ1. Therefore, dim(Iµ) = 1 and the sum

(cid:80)

(i1,...,iN !−1)∈Iµ

of Eq. (44) has only one term

This is the same formula obtained by combination of the binomial theorem and Eq. (38).

(45)

B.3 Coeﬃcients for N = 3 with µN = 0
The partitions and coeﬃcients of N are connected with the previous ones of N −1 according to the properties
µα(N−1,Γ)
(Γ/2) when µN = 0. For this reason, the coeﬃcients
computation problem for N = 3 particles with µ3 = 0 is similar to the problem for N = 2 of the previous
section. In this case the partitions are given by

µ (Γ/2) = C (N−1)

+ Γ/2 = µα(N,Γ)

and C (N )

µ

1 = Γ + 1 − α,
µα

and

µα

3 = 0.

(46)

The number of partitions is found from the condition µ
Np
1 when Γ/2 is an odd number. The result is Np = Int (Γ/4 + 1) and the set Iµ is
µ

Np
1 = µ

Np
1 when Γ/2 is an even number and µ

Np
1 + 1 =

Iµ :=

(cid:126)i : K1((cid:126)i, σ1) = µ1 ∧ K2((cid:126)i, σ2) = µ2 ∧ K3(i1, σ3) = 0 with

≥ i1 ≥ i2 ≥ . . . ≥ i5 ≥ 0

Γ
2

(cid:26)

(cid:27)

where (cid:126)i = (i1, . . . , i5). The components of the K-vector are

K1((cid:126)i, σ1) = i2 + i4,

K2((cid:126)i, σ2) = Γ/2 + i1 − 2i2 + 2i3 − 2i4 + i5,

K3((cid:126)i, σ3) = Γ − i1 + i2 − 2i3 + i4 − i5,

and the permutation matrix is given by Eq. (41). The solution is the following

i1 = i2 = i3 =

Γ
2

and i4 = i5 =

+ 1 − α.

(47)

Therefore Iµ has only one vector (cid:126)i when µ3 = 0 as is shown in Table 2 for the particular case of Γ = 8 and
Eq. (44) takes the form

In principle, the coeﬃcients computation with Eq. (52) does not oﬀer remarkable implementation diﬃculties.
Nevertheless, it is important to note that C (N )
µ (Γ/2) may have a large value as Γ or N increase. For instance,
the coeﬃcient for N = 5 particles with µ = (100, 100, 100, 0) at Γ = 100 is

C (N =5)

(100,100,100,0)(40) = 2042816020019820636556288572807323741663688000.

This value may easily overﬂow the maximum integer value permitted by the computer. Usually, this max-
imum value varies with the program used to implement the coeﬃcients computation formula as well as the
architecture of the machine. Fortunately, in order to solve this problem it is possible to use multiple precision
arithmetic libraries as GMP [19] included in some of our computations.

D Excess energy as a function of Γ

In this section we report the excess energy Uexc obtained from the exact expression, Eq. (19), the value
obtained by Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, and their relative diﬀerence. We have set ρb = 1 and L = 1.
The result presented in these tables is oriented to understand how Uexc depends on Γ, when it varies in a
range from Γ = 2 up to a high coupling of Γ = 100.

Table 10: Excess energy for N = 9.

E Excess energy as a function of N

In this section, we report the excess energy Uexc obtained from the exact expression, Eq. (19), when N
increases, for three ﬁxed values of Γ = 4, 6, 8. As before, we have set ρb = 1 and L = 1. A four parameter
ﬁt to an ansatz of the form

Uexc = q2(AN + B + C/N + D/N 2)

(53)

is proposed. As explained in Sec. 4.5, this is the expected ﬁnite-size expansion for the excess energy. The ﬁt
is done with four consecutive values of N , and the convergence of the parameters A, B, C and D is observed
as N increases. This allows us to obtain the bulk value of the excess internal energy and the ﬁnite size
corrections.
