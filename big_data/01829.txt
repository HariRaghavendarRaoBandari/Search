EXACTNESS OF LOCALLY COMPACT GROUPS

JACEK BRODZKI, CHRIS CAVE, AND KANG LI

Abstract. We give a new characterization of exactness for locally compact groups.
In
particular we prove that a group is exact if and only if it admits an amenable action on a
compact Hausdorﬀ space. This answers a question by Anantharaman-Delaroche.

1. Introduction

The notion of an amenable action was ﬁrst introduced by R. Zimmer in 1978 where he
ﬁrst deﬁned an amenable ergodic action [36]. The deﬁnition generalised the ﬁxed point
property of amenable groups and was stated in terms of cocycles of the action on a Borel
space. This new deﬁnition of an amenable action was used to give a partial solution to a
problem in ergodic theory concerning skew products [36]. Zimmer showed that if a G-space
S is amenable and α : S × G → H is a cocycle, and also the skew product S ×α H is ergodic
then H is amenable.

Following on from Zimmer’s work, A. Connes, J. Feldman and B. Weiss used amenable
actions to great eﬀect by proving the striking result that a countable measured equivalence
relation R is amenable if and only if R is a union of an increasing sequence of ﬁnite equivalence
relations [8].

In 1979, C. Anantharaman-Delaroche generalised the notion of amenable action to con-
tinuous group actions on von Neumann algebras [1]. This deﬁnition is analogous to the exis-
tence of a G-invariant mean on L∞(G) for amenable groups. In particular, Anantharaman-
Delaroche proved that for a continuous action α of G on a von Neumann algebra M , the
crossed product W ∗(M, G, α) is injective whenever the action is amenable and M is injective.
She extended this notion even further to actions of discrete groups on C ∗-algebras [3] and
proved an analogous theorem in this context: If α is an amenable action of G on a nuclear
C ∗-algebra A, which means that G acts amenably on the von Neumann envelope A′′ of A,
then the reduced cross product A ⋊α,r G is nuclear.

In 2000, C. Anantharaman-Delaroche and J. Renault generalised the notion of amenability
to locally compact groupoids [2]. In particular a group acts amenably on a compact Hausdorﬀ
space if and only if the transformation groupoid X ⋊ G is topologically amenable. When a
group acts amenably on a compact Hausdorﬀ space then we say that the group is amenable
at inﬁnity.

At around the same time, G. Yu showed that if a discrete group coarsely embeds into a
Hilbert space (we call such groups embeddable) then it satisﬁes the coarse Baum–Connes
conjecture [35]. In particular, via a descent argument, Yu showed that if the classifying space
BG is a ﬁnite complex and G is embeddable then the Novikov conjecture holds for this group.
Since then the technical condition on BG has been removed [30]. Yu introduced property A
for a metric space in the same article [35]. This property is stronger than embeddability and
is also better behaved [35]. Soon afterwards, N. Higson and J. Roe showed that property
A for a discrete group and amenability at inﬁnity are equivalent [17]. This implies that a
discrete group acting amenably on a compact Hausdorﬀ space is embeddable, and so satisﬁes
the Novikov conjecture. It was an open question whether every group admits an amenable

action on a compact Hausdorﬀ space. However Gromov’s construction [13, 5], and more
recently Osajda’s contruction [21], show that there exist groups whose Cayley graphs contain
appropriately embedded expanders, which implies that these groups are not embeddable.

In 2004, Roe generalised the notion of property A to general metric spaces [27], and
S. Deprez and the third author recently showed that property A and amenability at inﬁnity
are equivalent in the class of locally compact second countable groups [11].
In the same
paper they showed that the Baum–Connes assembly map is injective for locally compact
second countable groups that have property A [11].

Related to this, in 1999 E. Kirchberg and S. Wassermann introduced the notion of exact
groups in their study of continuous reduced cross products of C ∗-bundles [18]. They showed
that in the discrete case their notion of exactness is equivalent to the exactness of the reduced
group C ∗-algebra. The question whether this is true in the general case of locally compact
groups is still open [18, Section 6]. In this article, unless stated otherwise a group will be
exact, if it is exact in the sense of [18].

Over the next few years it was established that exactness and amenability at inﬁnity
In the general setting of locally compact
are equivalent for discrete groups [22, 14, 4].
groups, amenability at inﬁnity implies exactness of the group [4].
In order to provide a
partial converse to this implication, Anantharaman-Delaroche introduced a weak version
of inner amenability called property (W) [4] in the context of locally compact groups. In
particular, if G is inner amenable and C ∗
r (G) is nuclear then G is amenable [23]. It follows
as a consequence of Theorem 7.3. from [4] that if a locally compact group is exact and has
property (W) then it is amenable at inﬁnity. Anantharaman-Delaroche posed the question
whether exactness is equivalent to amenability at inﬁnity [4, Question 9.3.]. We answer this
question positively in the setting of locally compact second countable groups in the form of
the following equivalences.

Theorem A. Let G be a locally compact second countable group. Then the following are
equivalent

(1) G is amenable at inﬁnity.
(2) G is exact.
(3) The following sequence is exact
0 → C0(G) ⋊L,r G → C lu

b (G) ⋊L,r G → C lu

b (G)/C0(G) ⋊L,r G → 0.

(4) C lu

b (G) ⋊L,r G is nuclear.

See Theorem 5.6. Here C lu

b (G) is the C ∗-algebra of bounded, left-uniformly continuous
functions on G, see Section 4 . We would like to point out that the situation in the non-
discrete locally compact case is very diﬀerent to that in the discrete case.
In both cases
it is true that amenability at inﬁnity implies exactness. While the converse is now well
established in the discrete case, the existing proofs do not translate to the non-discrete case.

We mention another direction in which these studies of amenability can be extended.
Weak amenability was ﬁrst introduced by M. Cowling and U. Haagerup in [9] and then it
was proved that discrete weakly amenable groups are amenable at inﬁnity. In this article we
show that this result extends to locally compact second countable groups, see Theorem 3.4:

Theorem B. Let G be a locally compact second countable group. If G is weakly amenable
then G is amenable at inﬁnity.

It is known that every locally compact second countable group is coarsely equivalent to
[16,

a uniformly discrete, uniformly locally ﬁnite metric space [31] [10, Theorem 2.B.4.]
Lemma 3.3.]. We call this discrete metric subspace a metric lattice.

A key diﬃculty facing us is that exactness for locally compact groups is not known to be
a coarse invariant, which closes the obvious way to promote the results from the discrete
case. Our main contribution in this paper is a construction that circumvents this issue, and

EXACTNESS OF LOCALLY COMPACT GROUPS

3

which allows us to lift the required properties from the metric lattice to the ambient locally
compact group. As a corollary of our construction we establish that exactness for locally
compact groups is in fact a coarse invariant, see Corollary 5.7.

Corollary C. If G and H are coarsely equivalent locally compact second countable groups,
then G is exact if and only if H is exact.

The article is arranged as follows. In Section 2 we introduce the ideas of coarse geometry
and property A that we will be using throughout. In Section 3 we show that locally compact
second countable weakly amenable groups have property A. This requires a detailed study
of properties of kernels and ghost operators deﬁned on a metric lattice of the group.

In Section 4 we introduce exactness of groups and amenable actions and in section 5 we
prove our main result. The idea of the proof is that if the group does not have property
A then the metric lattice does not have property A and so by [28, Theorem 1.3.]
there
exists a non-compact ghost operator in the uniform Roe algebra of the metric lattice. An
isometric lift of this ghost operator provides an obstruction to the exactness in the middle
of the sequence in Theorem A. Indeed, a delicate computation shows that the lifted ghost
operator belongs to the kernel of the surjective map on the right.

We conclude by combining Theorem A with H. Sako’s result [29] to deduce that for a
b (G) ⋊L,r G is locally reﬂexive then G is

locally compact second countable group G, if C lu
amenable at inﬁnity.

2. Preliminaries

In this section we introduce the notions of coarse geometry we will be using throughout
the article. We will also introduce the notion of a metric lattice and explain the connection
between property A on the metric lattice and property A on the locally compact second
countable group.

Deﬁnition 2.1. Let (X, dX ) and (Y, dY ) be metric spaces. We say a map f : X → Y is
coarse if the inverse image under f of any bounded subset in Y is bounded in X and if for
all R > 0, there exists S > 0 such that

dX(x, x′) ≤ R =⇒ dY (f (x), f (x′)) ≤ S

for all x, x′ ∈ X. Two coarse maps f, g : X → Y are close if dY (f (x), g(x)) is bounded on
X.

Deﬁnition 2.2. We say that two metric spaces X and Y are coarsely equivalent if there
exist two coarse maps f : X → Y and g : Y → X such that g ◦ f and f ◦ g are close to the
identity maps on X and Y , respectively.

Deﬁnition 2.3. A metric space (Z, d) is uniformly locally ﬁnite if supz∈Z |B(z, S)| < ∞ for
all S > 0, where B(z, S) denotes the closed ball {x ∈ Z : d(z, x) ≤ S}.

A uniformly locally ﬁnite metric space is necessarily discrete and countable. However
being uniformly locally ﬁnite is not a coarse invariant even on uniformly discrete spaces [16,
Example 3.4]:

Example 2.4. Consider the triple (Dn, dn, xn), where Dn is the discrete space with n points,
dn is the discrete metric on Dn and each xn is a ﬁxed element in Dn. Let Z = ⊔n∈NDn
equipped with the following metric d:

d(z, y) = dj(z)(z, xj(z)) + |j(z) − j(y)| + dj(y)(y, xj(y)),

where j(x) = n if and only if x ∈ Dn. So (Z, d) is a proper uniformly discrete space
that is not uniformly locally ﬁnite but is coarsely equivalent to N. In particular, (Z, d) has

EXACTNESS OF LOCALLY COMPACT GROUPS

4

bounded geometry (see deﬁnition below). The metric space (Z, d) is not uniformly locally
ﬁnite because |B(xn, 1)| ≥ n for all n ∈ N.

In order to make this a coarse invariant, we consider the following notion on metric spaces.

Deﬁnition 2.5. A metric space (X, dX ) has bounded geometry if it is coarsely equivalent to
a uniformly locally ﬁnite (discrete) metric space (Z, dZ ).

See [32, Proposition 4.2] or [33, Proposition 1.1.3]. In fact, we can choose (Z, dZ ) in the

above deﬁnition to be a lattice of X in the following sense.

Deﬁnition 2.6. Let (X, d) be a metric space. We say that a uniformly discrete subspace

Z ⊆ X is a metric lattice, if there is R > 0 such that X = Sz∈Z B(z, R).

Note that the inclusion map Z ⊆ X is a coarse equivalence and it follows from Zorn’s

lemma that every metric space always contains metric lattices.

Deﬁnition 2.7 ([35][27, Proposition 2.3.] [11]). Let X be a bounded geometry proper metric
space. We say that X has property A if for all R, ε > 0 there exists S > 0 and a continuous
positive type kernel k : X × X → C such that

• if d(x, y) > S then k(x, y) = 0.
• if d(x, y) < R then |k(x, y) − 1| < ε.

This deﬁnition reduces to Yu’s original deﬁnition [35] when X is a discrete uniformly
locally ﬁnite metric space. It is well known that for discrete metric spaces property A is
invariant under coarse equivalence [32, Proposition 4.2].

Recall that every locally compact second countable group G admits a proper left-invariant
metric d that generates the topology on G and that such a metric is unique up to coarse
equivalence [31] [10, Theorem 2.B.4., Corollary 4.A.6] [16, Theorem 2.8.]. We will say that a
metric that generates the topology on G is a compatible metric. Moreover, the proper metric
space (G, d) has bounded geometry [16, Lemma 3.3.]. There is a nice connection between
Yu’s property A and property A on locally compact second countable groups through metric
lattices.

Proposition 2.8 ([11], Theorem 2.3 and [27], Lemma 2.2). Let G be a locally compact
second countable group equipped with a proper left-invariant compatible metric d. Then the
following conditions are equivalent:

(1) The metric space (G, d) has property A.
(2) Every uniformly locally ﬁnite metric lattice (Z, d) in G has property A.
(3) There exists a uniformly locally ﬁnite metric lattice (Z, d) in G satisfying property

A.

The proposition above implies that property A on locally compact second countable groups
is a coarse invariant. When we say a locally compact second countable group G has property
A it will mean that there exists a proper left invariant compatible metric d such that the
metric space (G, d) has property A.

There is a well-known operator algebraic characterization of Yu’s property A on uniformly
locally ﬁnite metric spaces in terms of uniform Roe algebras which we now recall. Every a ∈
B(ℓ2(Z)) can be represented as a Z × Z matrix: a = [ax,y]x,y∈Z , where ax,y := haδy, δxi ∈ C.

We deﬁne the propagation of a = [ax,y]x,y∈Z ∈ B(ℓ2(Z)) by
sup{d(x, y) : x, y ∈ Z, ax,y 6= 0}.

Let ER be the set of all bounded operators on ℓ2(Z) whose propagations are at most R. In
fact, ER is an operator system, i.e. a self-adjoint closed subspace of B(ℓ2(Z)) which contains

the unit of B(ℓ2(Z)). Moreover, the union SR>0 ER is a ∗-subalgebra of B(ℓ2(Z)) .

Deﬁnition 2.9. The C ∗-algebra deﬁned by the operator norm closure in B(ℓ2(Z))

C ∗

u(Z) = [R>0

ER

is called the uniform Roe algebra of Z.

Theorem 2.10. [30, Theorem 5.3] Let (Z, d) be a uniformly locally ﬁnite metric space. Then
the following conditions are equivalent:

(1) The metric space (Z, d) has Yu’s property A.
(2) The uniform Roe algebra C ∗

u(Z) is nuclear.

Deﬁnition 2.11. (Yu, see [26, 11.5.2]) An operator a ∈ C ∗
u(Z) is called a ghost if ax,y → 0
as x, y → ∞. We denote by G∗(Z) the collection of all ghost operators, which forms a closed
two sided ideal in C ∗

u(Z) and contains the compact operators on ℓ2(Z).

A natural question is that are all ghost operators compact? One can prove that for
a uniformly locally ﬁnite space with property A, all ghost operators are compact ([26,
Prop. 11.43]). Recently, the converse implication was proved by Roe and Willett.

Theorem 2.12. [28] A uniformly locally ﬁnite metric space has property A if and only if
every ghost operator in the uniform Roe algebra is compact.

3. Ghost operators and Weak amenability

Let us start by recalling some deﬁnitions. A kernel k : X × X → C on a nonempty
set X is called a Schur multiplier if for every operator a = [ax,y]x,y∈X ∈ B(ℓ2(X)) the
matrix [k(x, y)ax,y]x,y∈X represents an operator in B(ℓ2(X)), denoted mk(a). If k is a Schur
multiplier, it follows from the closed graph theorem that mk deﬁnes a bounded operator on
B(ℓ2(X)). We deﬁne the Schur norm kkkS to be the operator norm kmkk of mk. For instance,
any normalized positive type kernel is a Schur multiplier of norm 1; here by normalized we
mean that k(x, x) = 1 for all x. The following characterization of Schur multipliers is well-
known and is essentially due to Grothendieck.

Theorem 3.1 ([25], Theorem 5.1). Let k : X × X → C be a kernel, and let C ≥ 0. The
following conditions are equivalent:

(1) k is a Schur multiplier with kkkS ≤ C.
(2) There exist a Hilbert space H and two bounded maps ξ, η : X → H such that k(x, y) =

hηy, ξxi for all x, y ∈ X and supx∈X kξxk · supy∈X kηyk ≤ C.

Let G be a locally compact group. A continuous function ϕ : G → C is a Herz-Schur

multiplier if and only if the kernel bϕ : G × G → C deﬁned by

s, t ∈ G

bϕ(s, t) = ϕ(s−1t),

is a Schur multiplier on G. We denote by B2(G) the Banach space of Herz-Schur multipliers

on G equipped with the Herz-Schur norm kϕkB2 = kbϕkS.

Deﬁnition 3.2 (Weak amenability [9]). A locally compact group G is weakly amenable if
there exists a net (ϕi)i∈I of continuous, compactly supported Herz-Schur multipliers on G,
converging uniformly to 1 on compact sets, and such that supi kϕikB2 < ∞.

It is well-known that discrete countable weakly amenable groups have property A [15,
20, 22, 17]. In what follows, we will show that the same statement is true for all locally
compact second countable groups. The idea of the proof is to give a uniformly bounded
Schur multiplier characterization of property A.

The next result is an analogue of [26, Prop. 11.43] where we use Schur multipliers in place

of positive type kernels in the deﬁnition of property A.

EXACTNESS OF LOCALLY COMPACT GROUPS

Proposition 3.3. Let (Z, d) be a uniformly locally ﬁnite metric space. Assume that there
exists a constant C > 0 such that for any R > 0 and ε > 0, there exist S > 0 and a Schur
multiplier k : Z × Z → C with kkkS ≤ C such that

• If d(x, y) > S, then k(x, y) = 0.
• If d(x, y) ≤ R, then |k(x, y) − 1| < ε.

Then every ghost operator in C ∗
that the metric space (Z, d) has Yu’s property A.

u(Z) is compact. In particular, it follows from Theorem 2.12

Proof. For each n ∈ N there exist Sn > 0 and a Schur multiplier kn : Z × Z → C with
kknkS ≤ C which is supported within the Sn-neighbourhood of the diagonal, and moreover
|kn(x, y) − 1| < 1
n for d(x, y) ≤ n. From Theorem 3.1 we note that supx,y∈Z |kn(x, y)| ≤ C
for all n ∈ N.

Let mkn : B(ℓ2(Z)) → B(ℓ2(Z)) be the bounded operator associated with kn. Let also

M (kn, R) = sup{|kn(x, y) − 1| | d(x, y) ≤ R}

Then for every R > 0 and any a ∈ ER, it follows that

kmkn(a) − ak ≤ sup
z∈Z

|B(z, R)| · kak · M (kn, R) → 0,

as n → ∞.

Since kmknk ≤ C for all n ∈ N, we have in fact that kmkn(a) − ak → 0 for all a ∈ C ∗

u(Z).

If H ∈ C ∗

Theorem 3.1]). So H is compact, as mkn(H) → H in the operator norm.

u(Z) is a ghost operator, then each mkn(H) is a compact operator (see [7,
(cid:3)

The following theorem extends [12, Theorem 6.1] to the case of locally compact groups.

Given a subset L of a group G we deﬁne Tube(L) to be the set

Tube(L) = {(s, t) ∈ G × G : s−1t ∈ L}.

Theorem 3.4. Let G be a locally compact second countable group. The following conditions
are equivalent:

(1) The group G has property A.
(2) If there is a constant C > 0 such that for any compact subset K ⊆ G and ε > 0, there
exist a compact subset L ⊆ G and a (continuous) Schur multiplier k : G × G → C
with kkkS ≤ C such that supp k ⊆ Tube(L) and

If G is weakly amenable, then in particular the group G has property A.

sup{|k(s, t) − 1| | (s, t) ∈ Tube(K)} < ε.

Proof. (1) ⇒ (2): It follows from [11, Theorem 2.3]. In fact, we can take C = 1 if we assume
that the positive type kernel in [11, Theorem 2.3] is normalized.

(2) ⇒ (1): Let d be a proper left-invariant compatible metric on G such that the metric
space (G, d) has bounded geometry. By the assumption, any uniformly locally ﬁnite metric
lattice Z in (G, d) satisﬁes the conditions in Proposition 3.3, and hence (Z, d) has property
A. We complete the proof by applying Proposition 2.8.
(cid:3)

4. Topologically amenable actions and crossed products of C ∗-algebras

In this section we recall some deﬁnitions and state results on topologically amenable

actions, where we refer to [2, 4], and crossed products of C ∗-algebras, see [24, 34].

Let Prob(G) denote the space of Borel probability measures on a locally compact group
G. It is the state space of the C ∗-algebra C0(G) and it carries two natural topologies: the
norm topology and the weak-∗ topology. Recall that a locally compact group G acts on a
locally compact Hausdorﬀ space X if there exists a homomorphism α : G → Homeo(X) such

EXACTNESS OF LOCALLY COMPACT GROUPS

that the map G × X → X given by (g, x) 7→ α(g)(x) is continuous. Note that G acts on its
probability space Prob(G) by

for all s ∈ G and any Borel subset U in G.

s.m(U ) = m(s−1(U )),

Deﬁnition 4.1. [2] We say that the action G y X is topologically amenable if there exists
a net (mi)i∈I of weak-∗ continuous maps x 7→ mx
i from X into the space Prob(G) such that

ks.mx

i k = 0

uniformly on compact subsets of X × G.

Deﬁnition 4.2. [4] We say that a locally compact group G is amenable at inﬁnity if it
admits a topologically amenable action on a compact Hausdorﬀ space X.

We omit the proof of the following lemma as it follows from the deﬁnition of an amenable

action.

Lemma 4.3. Let X and Y be compact Hausdorﬀ G-spaces. Assume that there exists a
continuous G-equivariant map f : X → Y . If the action G y Y is topologically amenable,
then so is the action G y X.

If a locally compact group G is amenable at inﬁnity, then there are some canonical choices
of compact spaces equipped with a topologically amenable action of the group G. For
instance, let us denote by C lu
b (G) the C ∗-algebra of bounded left-uniformly continuous func-
tions on G. That is
C lu

b (G) = {f ∈ Cb(G) : kLgf − f k∞ → 0 whenever g → e}

where Lgf (h) = f (g−1h) for all g, h ∈ G. Let βlu(G) be the spectrum of C lu
b (G). It is the
universal compact Hausdorﬀ left G-space equipped with a continuous G-equivariant inclusion
of G as an open dense subspace. Let ∂G := βlu(G)\G denote the boundary of βlu(G). It is
also a compact Hausdorﬀ space and the left translation action of G on βlu(G) restricts to
an action on ∂G. The inclusion map from ∂G into βlu(G) is also equivariant. The following
proposition summarises the relationships between the notions introduced here.

Proposition 4.4. [4, Proposition 3.4] Let G be a locally compact group. The following
conditions are equivalent:

(1) G is amenable at inﬁnity.
(2) The left translation action of G on βlu(G) is topologically amenable.
(3) The left translation action of G on ∂G is topologically amenable.

A G-C ∗-algebra consists of a C ∗-algebra A, a locally compact group G, and a group

homomorphism α : G → Aut(A) such that the map g 7→ αg(a) is continuous for all a ∈ A.

Deﬁnition 4.5. Let G be a locally compact group and A be a G-C ∗-algebra equipped
with the action α. A covariant representation of the G-C ∗-algebra A is a pair (π, U ) where
π : A → B(H) is a ∗-homomorphism and U : G → B(H) is a unitary representation of G
such that Usπ(a)U ∗

s = π(αs(a)) for all s ∈ G and a ∈ A.

We denote by Cc(G, A) the vector space of continuous A-valued functions on G with

compact support. Deﬁne a convolution product and involution on Cc(G, A) by

f ∗ g(s) = ZG

f (t)αt(g(t−1s)) dµ(t)

and

f ∗(s) =

αs(f (s−1)∗)

∆(s)

,

where ∆ is the modular function and µ is a left Haar measure on G, respectively, which we
now ﬁx from this point onwards. In this way, Cc(G, A) becomes a ∗-algebra.

EXACTNESS OF LOCALLY COMPACT GROUPS

Let us assume given a covariant representation (π, U ) of a G-C ∗-algebra A on a Hilbert

space H. Then

π ⋊ U (f ) = ZG

π(f (s))Us dµ(s)

deﬁnes a ∗-representation of Cc(G, A) on the Hilbert space H.
If π ⋊ U is faithful then
we deﬁne a norm on Cc(G, A) by kf k(π,U ) := kπ ⋊ U (f )k and we denote the completion of
Cc(G, A) with respect this norm by A ⋊(π,U ) G.
Deﬁnition 4.6. Let G be a locally compact group and A be a G-C ∗-algebra equipped with
the action α of G. The full crossed product A⋊α G is the completion of Cc(G, A) with respect
to the universal C ∗-norm k · ku given by

kf ku := sup{kπ ⋊ U (f )k : (π, U ) is a covariant represention of A}.

It follows from the deﬁnition that π ⋊ U extends to a ∗-representation of A ⋊α G for every

covariant representation (π, U ) of a G-C ∗-algebra A.

To deﬁne the reduced crossed product, we begin with a faithful ∗-representation π of the

G-C ∗-algebra A on a Hilbert space H. Deﬁne a ∗-representation πA

α of A on L2(G, H) by

(πA

α (a)ξ)(t) = π(αt−1(a))ξ(t),

for a ∈ A, t ∈ G and ξ ∈ L2(G, H). Let λ denote the left-regular representation of G
on L2(G). Then (πA
α , λ ⊗ 1) is a covariant representation of A. The regular representation
πA
α

⋊ (λ ⊗ 1) of Cc(G, A) on L2(G, H) is faithful.

Deﬁnition 4.7. Let G be a locally compact group and A be a G-C ∗-algebra equipped with
the action α. The reduced crossed product A⋊α,r G is the completion of Cc(G, A) with respect
to the reduced C ∗-norm k · kr given by

kf kr := kπA
α

⋊ (λ ⊗ 1)(f )k.

It is well-known that the reduced crossed product A ⋊α,r G does not depend on the choice
of the faithful representation π : A → B(H) [6, Proposition 4.1.5.]. Moreover, we have a
natural surjective ∗-homomorphism A ⋊α G → A ⋊α,r G.

For a given locally compact group G, the full crossed product (−) ⋊ G and the reduced
crossed product (−)⋊r G form functors from the category of G-C ∗-algebras to the category of
C ∗-algebras. Indeed, let A and B be G-C ∗-algebras with actions α and β, respectively. For
every equivariant ∗-homomorphism θ : A → B there are two canonical ∗-homomorphisms

θu : A ⋊α G → B ⋊β G,

and θr : A ⋊α,r G → B ⋊β,r G.

Example 4.8. Let Cb(G) be the space of bounded continuous complex valued functions on
G. Let M : Cb(G) → B(L2(G)) be the multiplication operator given by

(M (f )ξ)(x) = f (x)ξ(x),

where f ∈ Cb(G), ξ ∈ L2(G) and x ∈ G. It is clear that M is a faithful ∗-representation.
Let L and R be the left and right translations on Cb(G), respectively. More precisely,

(Lgf )(x) = f (g−1x) and (Rgf )(x) = f (xg),

for f ∈ Cb(G) and x, g ∈ G. We denote the space of bounded left (right) uniformly contin-
uous functions on G by C lu
b (G)). We have the left and right regular
representations λ, ρ : G → U (L2(G)) given by

b (G) (respectively C ru

(λgξ)(x) = ξ(g−1x) and (ρgξ)(x) = ξ(xg)∆(g)1/2,

where ξ ∈ L2(G) and g, x ∈ G. It follows that (M, λ) and (M, ρ) are covariant representations
of the C ∗-dynamical systems (C lu

b (G), G, R), respectively.

b (G), G, L) and (C ru

Strictly speaking C lu

(M,λ) G are represented on two diﬀerent

Hilbert spaces. However, we include a proof of the following standard result.

Proposition 4.9. In the notation introduced above, we have the following isomorphisms:

b (G) ⋊(M,ρ) G ∼= C lu
C ru

b (G) ⋊(M,λ) G ∼= C lu

b (G) ⋊L,r G ∼= C ru

b (G) ⋊R,r G.

Proof. Let ψ be the G-equivarant ∗-isomorphism ψ : C ru
Let ψ be the extension of ψ to

b (G) → C lu

b (G), ψ(f )(g) = f (g−1).

ψ : Cc(G, C ru

b (G)) → Cc(G, C lu

b (G))

where ψ(f )s(g) = fs(g−1). Let U : L2(G) → L2(G), (U ξ)(g) = ξ(g−1)∆(g−1)1/2 for all
ξ ∈ L2(G) and x ∈ G. Then the isomorphism

b (G) ⋊(M,ρ) G ∼= C lu
C ru

b (G) ⋊(M,λ) G

is given by the map f 7→ U ψ(f )U ∗ for all f ∈ Cc(G, C ru

b (G)).

Now ﬁx a unit vector η0 ∈ L2(G) and deﬁne a map

by

V1 : L2(G) → L2(G, L2(G))

(V1ξ)g(x) = ξ(g)η0(x)

for all ξ ∈ L2(G). Similarly, we deﬁne

V2 : L2(G, L2(G)) → L2(G, L2(G));

(V2ξ)g(x) = ξgx−1∆(x−1)1/2.

Finally, let V = V ∗

2 V1. Then there is an isomorphism

C lu

b (G) ⋊

(M,λ) G ∼= C lu

b (G) ⋊L,r G

given by f 7→ V f V ∗ for all f ∈ C lu

b (G) ⋊

(M,λ) G.

Let θ = ψ−1. Then θ is an isomorphism and extends to a ∗-isomorphism

θr : C lu

b (G) ⋊L,r G → C ru

b (G) ⋊R,r G.

(cid:3)

From this point on we shall use the isomorphisms C lu
b (G) ⋊(M,ρ) G ∼= C ru
C ru
It is well-known that M ⋊ ρ : C ru

b (G) ⋊R,r G without further mention.

b (G) ⋊(M,λ) G ∼= C lu

b (G) ⋊L,r G and

b (G) ⋊R G → B(L2(G)) factors through a faithful
∗-representation M ⋊r ρ of C ru
b (G) ⋊R,r G. Moreover, M ⋊r ρ induces a ∗-isomorphism
between C0(G) ⋊R,r G and the algebra of compact operators K(L2(G)) [34, Theorem 4.24.].
We can also conclude the same facts for (M, λ) on (C lu

b (G), G, L).

The following summary will be helpful in the next section.

Theorem 4.10. [3, 4] Let G be a locally compact group and X be a locally compact Hausdorﬀ
G-space. Consider the following conditions:

(1) The action of G on X is topologically amenable.
(2) (C0(X) ⊗ A) ⋊ G = (C0(X) ⊗ A) ⋊r G for every G-C ∗-algebra A.
(3) C0(X) ⋊r G is nuclear.

Then (1) ⇒ (2) ⇒ (3). Moreover, (3) ⇒ (1) if G is discrete.

Remark 4.11. Condition (3) does not imply condition (1) in general. For example, the
reduced group C ∗-algebra C ∗

r (G) is always nuclear if the group G is connected (see [23]).

5. Exactness of locally compact groups

In this section we show that the exactness of a locally compact second countable group is
equivalent to amenability at inﬁnity. This solves an open problem raised by Anantharaman-
Delaroche [4, Problem 9.3.]. We would like to point out that the situation in the locally
compact case is very diﬀerent to that in the discrete case.
In both cases it is true that
amenability at inﬁnity implies exactness. The converse is now well established in the discrete
case, but the existing proofs do not translate to the locally compact case. In this section we
provide the required proof.

Deﬁnition 5.1. [18, 19] We say that a locally compact group G is exact if the reduced
crossed product functor A → A ⋊r G preserves short exact sequences of G-C ∗-algebras. Here
we suppress the homomorphism α from the notation. Thus for every G-equivariant short
exact sequence of G-C ∗-algebras

0 → I → A → A/I → 0,

the corresponding sequence

of reduced crossed products is also exact.

0 → I ⋊r G → A ⋊r G → A/I ⋊r G → 0

Remark 5.2. The corresponding morphisms ιr : I ⋊rG → A⋊rG and qr : A⋊rG → A/I ⋊rG
are always injective and surjective, respectively. Moreover, Im ιr ⊆ ker qr. So the group G
is exact if and only if this inclusion is an equality for every G-C ∗-algebra A and an invariant
closed ideal I in A. However, the full crossed product functor is always exact by its universal
property. We mention here that Gromov [13, 5], and more recently Osajda [21] have provided
examples of non-exact groups.

We now identify all elements in A ⋊r G which are in ker qr. The next proposition provides
a useful criterion for this in terms of slice maps. Recall that for any normal linear functional
ψ ∈ B(L2(G))∗, the slice map Sψ corresponding to ψ is the continuous map deﬁned as follows

Sψ : A ⋊α,r G

⋊(λ⊗1)

πA
−−−−−−→ B(L2(G, H)) ∼= B(H)⊗B(L2(G))
α

idB(H)⊗ψ
−−−−−−→ B(H),

where πA
⋊ (λ ⊗ 1) is the regular representation associated to the reduced crossed product
α
A ⋊α,r G [18]. If ψ = ωξ,η, where ξ, η ∈ Cc(G) and ωξ,η(x) = hxξ, ηi for x ∈ B(L2(G)). Then
from the proof of [18, Lemma 2.1.] it follows

Sψ(f ) = ZGZG

ξ(g−1h)η(h)αh−1(f (g)) dµ(g)dµ(h),

f ∈ Cc(G, A).

Proposition 5.3. [18, Proposition 2.2] Let 0 → I → A → A/I → 0 be an exact sequence of
G-C ∗-algebras. For x ∈ A ⋊r G, the following are equivalent:

(1) x ∈ ker qr.
(2) Sψ(x) ∈ I for all ψ ∈ B(L2(G))∗.
(3) Sωξ,η (x) ∈ I for all ξ, η ∈ Cc(G).

Before we prove the main theorem, we need to construct a lifting procedure that will
establish a connection between a metric lattice Z and the ambient group G. This will be
done in the next two Propositions.

Proposition 5.4. Let G be a locally compact second countable group equipped with a proper
If Z is a uniformly locally ﬁnite metric lattice in the
left-invariant compatible metric d.
metric space (G, d), then there exist a faithful ∗-homomorphism Φ : C ∗
b (G) ⋊R,r G
and a c.c.p. map E : C ru

u(Z) → C ru
u(Z) satisfying the following properties:

b (G) ⋊R,r G → C ∗

(1) E ◦ Φ = IdC ∗
(2) T ∈ K(ℓ2(Z)) if and only if Φ(T ) ∈ C0(G) ⋊R,r G.

u(Z).

EXACTNESS OF LOCALLY COMPACT GROUPS

11

Proof. Since Z is uniformly discrete, we ﬁx δ > 0 such that for all z, w ∈ Z, d(z, w) > δ,
whenever z 6= w. Let ϕ be a continuous compactly supported positive valued function on
G such that supp ϕ ⊆ B(e, δ/4) and kϕk2 = 1. For z ∈ Z, set ϕz to be the function
g 7→ ϕ(z−1g) for g ∈ G. Clearly, each ϕz is supported on a δ/4-neighbourhood around z. As
Z is δ-uniformly discrete, each ϕz has disjoint support. In particular {ϕz : z ∈ Z} forms an
orthonormal set in L2(G).

Deﬁne an operator W : ℓ2(Z) → L2(G) as an extension of δz 7→ ϕz. Hence for η ∈ ℓ2(Z),

(W η)(x) = Xz∈Z

η(z)ϕz(x)

for all x ∈ G. Moreover, for ξ ∈ L2(G) and z ∈ Z

W ∗ξ(z) = Z ξ(y)ϕz(y) dµ(y).

It is clear that W is an isometry as it sends an orthonormal basis to an orthonormal set.

Let T ∈ C ∗

u(Z) have propagation R and denote hT δw, δzi by Tz,w. By left invariance of

the Haar integral we have that for all x ∈ G and all ξ ∈ L2(G),

(W T W ∗)(ξ)(x) = Xz∈Z

ϕz(x) Xw∈Z

Tz,wZG

ξ(y)ϕw(y) dµ(y)

=ZG Xz,w∈Z

ϕz(x)ϕw(xy)Tz,wξ(xy) dµ(y),

where we can switch the order of summation and integration as the sums are ﬁnite because
of the ﬁnite propagation of T .

Now, we deﬁne a function bT : G × G → C given by

bTy(x) = Xz,w∈Z

ϕz(x)ϕw(xy)Tz,w∆(y)−1/2.

(5.1)

for all (y, x) ∈ G × G. The supports of ϕz for all z ∈ Z are pairwise disjoint so for all
x, y ∈ G there is at most one pair (z, w) ∈ Z × Z such that ϕz(x) and ϕw(xy) are non-zero.

It follows that bTy is a bounded function for all y ∈ G. For a ﬁxed y ∈ G, if d(x, x′) < δ/4

and d(xy, x′y) < δ/4 then there exists at most one pair (z, w) ∈ Z × Z such that ϕz(x),
ϕz(x′) and ϕw(xy), ϕw(x′y) are all non-zero. For a ﬁxed x ∈ G, if d(y, y′) < δ/4 then there
is at most one w ∈ Z such that ϕw(xy) and ϕw(xy′) are both non-zero.

Claim: bT ∈ Cc(G, C ru
To prove the Claim, let us ﬁx ε > 0. First we show that for a ﬁxed y ∈ G, bTy ∈ C ru

b (G).
As ϕ is compactly supported it is uniformly continuous so there exists δ′ > 0 such that if
d(x, x′) < δ′ then

b (G)).

|ϕ(x) − ϕ(x′)| <

.

Let g ∈ G be such that d(e, g) + d(e, y−1gy) < min{δ′, δ/4}. Then there exists at most one
pair (z, w) ∈ Z × Z such that ϕz(x), ϕz(xg) and ϕw(xy), ϕw(xgy) are all non-zero. Hence
for all x ∈ G,

|RgbTy(x) − bTy(x)| ≤ |ϕ(z−1xg) − ϕ(z−1x)|ϕ(w−1xy)Tz,w∆(y)−1/2
As the choice of g did not depend on x ∈ G hence it follows kRgbTy − bTyk∞ < ε whenever
d(e, g) + d(e, y−1gy) < min{δ′, δ/4} and so bTy ∈ C ru
Now we show the map y 7→ bTy is compactly supported. Choose y ∈ G such that d(e, y) >

R + δ. Then for all x ∈ G there exists exactly one pair (z, w) ∈ Z × Z such that ϕz(x) and

+ |ϕ(w−1xgy) − ϕ(w−1xy)|ϕ(z−1x)Tz,w∆(y)−1/2 ≤ ε.

b (G).

EXACTNESS OF LOCALLY COMPACT GROUPS

12

ϕw(xy) are non-zero. However

d(z, w) > d(x, xy) − d(x, z) − d(w, xy) > R

and so Tz,w = 0. It then follows that bTy = 0 whenever d(e, y) > R + δ so indeed the map
y 7→ bTy is compactly supported.

Consider the continuous function y 7→ ∆(y)1/2. There exists t > 0 such that ∆(y)1/2 ≤ t

for all y ∈ B(e, R + δ). There exists δ′′ > 0 such that if d(y, y′) < δ′′ then

|ϕ(y) − ϕ(y′)| <

ε

kϕk∞kT kt

.

Let y, y′ ∈ G such that d(y, y′) < min{δ′′, δ/4}. Then there exists at most one w ∈ Z such
that ϕw(xy) and ϕw(xy′) are non-zero. Hence for all x ∈ G

|bTy(x) − bTy′(x)| ≤ |ϕ(w−1xy) − ϕ(w−1xy′)|ϕ(z−1x)Tz,wt ≤ ε.

Thus whenever d(y, y′) < min{δ′′, δ/4} it follows that kbTy − bTy′k < ε and so in particular
bT ∈ Cc(G, C ru
We now show that the operator W T W ∗ in B(L2(G)) is the image of bT under the faithful

∗-representation M ⋊r ρ. Indeed, for all ξ ∈ L2(G) and x ∈ G

b (G)). This ends the proof of the Claim.

(M ⋊r ρ)(bT )(ξ)(x) = ZG bTy(x)ξ(xy)∆(y)1/2 dµ(y) = (W T W ∗)(ξ)(x).

Since the image of M ⋊r ρ is closed, we conclude that W C ∗
of M ⋊r ρ. Hence, there is a well-deﬁned faithful ∗-homomorphism

u(Z)W ∗ is contained in the image

Φ : C ∗

u(Z) → C ru

b (G) ⋊R,r G

deﬁned by

Φ(T ) = (M ⋊r ρ)−1(W T W ∗).

If T has ﬁnite propagation, then it follows from our last calculation that Φ(T ) = bT .

We now deﬁne a c.c.p. map

by

where a ∈ C ru

b (G) ⋊R,r G.

E : C ru

b (G) ⋊R,r G → B(ℓ2(Z))

E(a) = W ∗M ⋊r ρ(a)W,

We claim that the image of E is contained in C ∗

u(Z). Indeed, let f ∈ Cc(G, C ru

b (G)) with

support in B(e, s) for some s > 0, then

hW ∗(M ⋊r ρ(f ))W δw, δzi = hM ⋊r ρ(f )(ϕw), ϕzi

= ZGZG

fy(x)ϕw(xy)∆(y)1/2ϕz(x) dµ(y)dµ(x).

However this integral is only non-zero when x ∈ B(z, δ/4) and xy ∈ B(w, δ/4). Thus
whenever d(z, w) > s + δ and x ∈ B(z, δ/4) and xy ∈ B(w, δ/4) it follows that

d(e, y) = d(x, xy) ≥ d(z, w) − d(xy, w) − d(x, z) > s.

Hence fy = 0 and so hW ∗M ⋊r ρ(f )W δw, δzi = 0 whenever d(z, w) > s + δ. In particular
E(f ) has propagation at most s + δ and so the claim follows.

Property (1) in the statement of the Proposition now follows from the constructions of Φ
and E. Furthermore, since W is an isometry and M ⋊r ρ induces a ∗-isomorphism between
C0(G) ⋊R,r G and K(L2(G)), property (2) follows from the fact that the compact operators
form a two-sided ideal.

Proposition 5.5. Let G be a locally compact second countable group equipped with a proper
left-invariant compatible metric d, and let Z be a uniformly locally ﬁnite metric lattice in the
metric space (G, d). Furthermore, let Φ : C ∗
b (G) ⋊R,r G be the map constructed in
Proposition 5.4. Then the image under Φ of the ghost ideal G∗(Z) is contained in the kernel
of the map

u(Z) → C ru

qr : C ru

b (G) ⋊R,r G → (C ru

b (G)/C0(G)) ⋊R,r G.

Proof. Let H ∈ G∗(Z). By Proposition 5.3, in order to prove that Φ(H) ∈ ker qr, it is
suﬃcient to show that Sωξ,η (Φ(H)) ∈ C0(G) for all ξ, η ∈ Cc(G), where Sωξ,η is the slice map
established in 5.3.

Given ε > 0 and ξ, η ∈ Cc(G), we need to ﬁnd C > 0 such that

d(e, x) > C ⇒ |Sωξ,η (Φ(H))(x)| < ε.

Consider the bounded continuous kernel k : G × G → C given by k(g, h) = ξ(g−1h)η(h).
Since both ξ and η are compactly supported, there exist two compact subsets K1 and K2
such that supp k ⊆ K1 × K2. Let D be a positive number such that

d(g, h) + d(e, h) + ∆(g)−1/2 ≤ D,

for all (g, h) ∈ K1 × K2. Choose a small ε′ > 0 such that

3ε′Dkξk∞kηk∞µ(K1)µ(K2)kϕk2

∞ ≤ ε.

Since H is a ghost, we choose a N > 0 such that if z, w /∈ B(e, N ) then |Hz,w| < ε′. As the
slice map Sωξ,η is continuous, we can choose an operator T ∈ C ∗
u(Z) of ﬁnite propagation
such that

kT − HkB(ℓ2(Z)) + kSωξ,η (Φ(T ) − Φ(H))k∞ < min{ε/3, ε′}.

In particular, |Tz,w − Hz,w| < ε′ for all z, w ∈ Z. We note that Φ(T ) = bT and for all x ∈ G

Sωξ,η (bT )(x) = ZGZG
= ZGZG

k(g, h) Xz,w∈Z

ϕz(xh−1)ϕw(xh−1g)Tz,w∆(g)−1/2 dµ(g)dµ(h).

Depending on x, there exists at most one pair (z0, w0) ∈ Z × Z such that ϕz0(xh−1) and
ϕw0(xh−1g) are non-zero. In particular (z0, w0) ∈ B(xh−1, δ/4) × B(xh−1g, δ/4).

Set C = N + D + δ/4. If d(e, x) > C and (g, h) ∈ K1 × K2, then

d(e, z0) ≥ d(x, e) − d(h, e) − d(z0, xh−1) > C − D − δ/4 = N,
d(e, w0) ≥ d(e, x) − d(xh−1g, x) − d(w0, xh−1g) > C − D − δ/4 = N.

In particular, |Tz0,w0| ≤ |Tz0,w0 − Hz0,w0| + |Hz0,w0| < 2ε′. It follows that

We are ready to prove the main theorem of this section. Recall that C lu

b (G) ∼= C(βlu(G))

and C lu

b (G)/C0(G) ∼= C(∂G).

Theorem 5.6. Let G be a locally compact second countable group. Then the following
conditions are equivalent.

(1) G is amenable at inﬁnity.
(2) G is exact.

(3) The sequence

0 → C0(G) ⋊L,r G → C(βlu(G)) ⋊L,r G → C(∂G) ⋊L,r G → 0

is exact.

(4) C(∂G) ⋊L G ∼= C(∂G) ⋊L,r G canonically.
(5) C(βlu(G)) ⋊L,r G is nuclear.

Proof. We will show that (1) ⇒ (2) ⇒ (3) ⇒ (1), (1) ⇒ (4) ⇒ (3) and (1) ⇔ (5).

(1) ⇒ (2): This follows from [4, Theorem 7.2].

(2) ⇒ (3): This follows from the deﬁnition of the exactness of G.

(3) ⇒ (1): We will show that if G is not amenable at inﬁnity, then the sequence in
condition (3) is not exact. It follows from [11, Corollary 2.9] and Proposition 2.8 that there
exists a uniformly locally ﬁnite metric lattice Z in G without Yu’s property A. Theorem
2.12 together with Propositions 5.4 and 5.5 imply that C ∗
u(Z) contains a non-compact ghost
T and that Φ(T ) is an obstruction for the exactness of the following sequence:

0 → C0(G) ⋊R,r G → C ru

b (G) ⋊R,r G → (C ru

b (G)/C0(G)) ⋊R,r G → 0.

We claim that this sequence is exact if and only if the sequence in condition (3) is exact.
Indeed, the inverse homeomorphism on G induces a commutative diagram:

0

C ru

b (G)) ⋊R,r G

(C ru

b (G)/C0(G)) ⋊R,r G

The claim follows by a diagram chase.

(1) ⇒ (4): This follows from Proposition 4.4 and Theorem 4.10.

(4) ⇒ (3): Consider the following canonical diagram:

C(βlu(G)) ⋊L G

C(∂G) ⋊L G

/ C0(G) ⋊L,r G

/ C(∂G) ⋊L,r G

/ 0.

The diagram commutes and the middle vertical arrow is surjective. Since the top sequence is
exact and the right vertical arrow is injective, the bottom sequence is also exact. (1) ⇒ (5):
This follows from Proposition 4.4 and Theorem 4.10.

(5) ⇒ (1): By assumption, the two isomorphic crossed products

b (G) ⋊R,r G ∼= C(βlu(G)) ⋊L,r G

are nuclear. Let Z be a uniformly locally ﬁnite metric lattice in G. Then it follows from
u(Z) factors through the nuclear C ∗-algebra
Proposition 5.4 that the identity map on C ∗
C ru
u(Z) is also nuclear. Therefore Z has property A, which implies
that G has property A. Therefore G is amenable at inﬁnity.

Corollary 5.7. If G and H are coarsely equivalent locally compact second countable groups,
then G is exact if and only if H is exact.

Proof. If G is exact, then it is amenable at inﬁnity, which is equivalent to property A. Since
property A is a coarse invariant, H also has property A, therefore H is exact.

6. Concluding remarks

We ﬁnish by connecting our work to a remarkable result of H. Sako:

Theorem 6.1 ([29]). Let (Z, d) be a uniformly locally ﬁnite metric space. Then the following
conditions are equivalent:

(1) The metric space (Z, d) has Yu’s property A.
(2) The uniform Roe algebra C ∗
(3) The uniform Roe algebra C ∗
(4) The uniform Roe algebra C ∗

u(Z) is nuclear.
u(Z) is exact.
u(Z) is locally reﬂexive.

We refer to [6] for more details. Combining Sako’s result with Proposition 5.4 and Theorem

5.6 we obtain an analogous result on locally compact second countable groups.

Corollary 6.2. Let G be a locally compact second countable group. Then the following
conditions are equivalent.

(1) G is amenable at inﬁnity.
(2) C ru
b (G) ⋊R,r G is nuclear.
(3) C ru
b (G) ⋊R,r G is exact.
(4) C ru
b (G) ⋊R,r G is locally reﬂexive.

Proof. If the algebra C ru
u(Z), where
Z is a metric lattice in G is also locally reﬂexive. Therefore Z has property A, so G has
property A and thus G is amenable at inﬁnity.
(cid:3)

b (G) ⋊R,r G is locally reﬂexive then the subalgebra C ∗
