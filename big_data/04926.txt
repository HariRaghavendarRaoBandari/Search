VARIETIES

SOUMYA BANERJEE AND MAHIR BILEN CAN

Abstract. We provide a GKM-type description of the equivariant K-theory of a smooth
projective spherical variety. This provides an integral K-theory version of Brion’s calculation
of equivariant Chow-cohomology of such varieties. We then analyze the torus equivariant
K-theory of wonderful compactiﬁcations of minimal rank symmetric varieties obtaining a
formula for their structure constants and generalizing some recent results of Uma in the
group case. We consider applications to Chow-rings using equivariant Riemann-Roch map.

1. Introduction

Let G be a connected reductive algebraic group and let B ⊆ G be a Borel subgroup and
T ⊆ B denote the maximal torus contained in B. Among G-varieties the particular class of
spherical varieties, namely varieties containing a dense B-orbit, are particularly important
and well studied. Well known examples include toric varieties, ﬂag varieties, symmetric
varieties and their compactiﬁcations, as well as reductive algebraic monoids. The main goal
of this article is to present a concrete description of the equivariant K-theory of a smooth
projective spherical G-variety. A secondary goal is to understand the structural aspects of T
(resp. G) equivariant K-theory of the important subclass of wonderful compactiﬁcations of
minimal rank symmetric varieties.

Historically speaking (generalized) equivariant cohomology theories were ﬁrst considered in
the context of topological spaces with action of a compact group. Building on earlier ideas of
Chang-Skjelbred, the theory was arguably put in a deﬁnitive form by Goresky, Kottwitz and
MacPherson (GKM) in [20]. Their seminal work was extremely inﬂuential and the subsequent
years saw a wealth of “GKM-type” results and their remarkable applications.

In algebraic geometry, building on Totaro’s ideas, Edidin and Graham in [14] provided a
viable deﬁnition of equivariant Chow-cohomology for schemes with action of a linear algebraic
group. Soon after, Brion in [8] gave an explicit presentation of the torus equivariant Chow-ring
A∗
T (X) of a T -scheme X. When X is a smooth projective spherical G-variety and T is the
maximal torus of G, Brion noted that his theorem specializes to a GKM-type presentation of
the T -equivariant Chow-ring, see loc. cit..

The algebraic K-theory of coherent equivariant sheaves on a scheme with a group action was
ﬁrst considered by Thomason. He established several foundational results such as localization,
homotopy-invariance etc.and techniques in [38]. More recently, Vezzosi and Vistoli were
successful in extending Thomason’s foundations to establish GKM-type results in some special
cases in [40, 41]. In particular, the result most relevant to this paper is the following theorem.
Theorem 1.1 (Vezzosi-Vistoli [41]). Suppose G is a diagonalizable group acting on a smooth
proper scheme X deﬁned over a perfect ﬁeld; denote by T the toral component of G, that
is the maximal subtorus contained in G. Then the restriction homomorphism on K-groups
KG,∗(X) → KG,∗(X T ) is injective, and its image equals the intersection of all images of the
restriction homomorphisms KG,∗(X S) → KG,∗(X T ) for all subtori S ⊂ T of codimension 1.
In this paper, our ﬁrst main result is a specialization of the above result to the particular
case of smooth and projective spherical varieties. We obtain an integral equivariant K-theory
version of Brion’s result in [8, Theorem 7.3].
Theorem 1.2. Let X be a smooth projective spherical G variety. Let T be a maximal
torus of G and R(T ) denote its representation ring. Then the set of T ﬁxed points X T is
ﬁnite and the T equivariant K-theory KT,∗(X) is isomorphic to the ring of ordered tuples
(1) fx − fy = 0 mod (1 − χ) when x, y are connected by a T stable curve with weight χ.
(2) fx − fy = fx − fz = 0 mod (1 − χ) and fy − fz = 0 mod (1 − χ2), where χ is a
root and an irreducible component of the subvariety XKer(χ) which contains the points
x, y, z is isomorphic to P2. There is an element in the Weyl group of G that ﬁxes x
and permutes the point y and z.
(3) fx − fy = fy − fz = fz − fw = fx − fw = 0 mod (1 − χ) where χ is a root and an
irreducible component of the subvariety XKer(χ) which contains the points x, y, z, w is
isomorphic to P1 × P1. There is an element in the Weyl group of G that ﬁxes two
points and permutes the other two.
(4) fx − fy = fz − fw = 0 mod (1 − χ) and fy − fz = 0 mod (1 − χ2n) and fx − fw = 0
mod (1 − χn), where n is an integer, χ is root and an irreducible component of
the subvariety XKer(χ) which contains the points x, y, z, w is isomorphic to the ruled
surface Fn. There is an element in the Weyl group of G that ﬁxes the points x and w
and permutes z and y.

x∈X T K∗(k) ⊗ R(T ) satisfying the following congruence conditions:

(fx) ∈(cid:81)

Moreover, the Weyl group W of G acts on the torus ﬁxed point set X T by permuting them

and the G equivariant K-theory is given by the space of W -invariants.

Roughly speaking, following the notation of Theorem 1.1, the proof of the above theorem

splits into two logical steps.

(i) Understanding the structure of the subvarieties X S.
(ii) Finding a tangible way to compute the K-theories KT,∗(X S).
To this end, the ﬁrst step already appears in Brion’s analysis of the equivariant Chow-rings
and we follow a similar strategy. In the second step, our solution is to relate the equivariant
K-theory computations to toric computations. This requires some inputs from theory of
compactiﬁcation of spherical homogeneous spaces of rank one (see Section 3) and some formal
properties of equivariant K-theory (see Section 2). A complete classiﬁcation of rank one
spherical varieties is due to Ahiezer and we heavily depend on his work, see [1, 6].

In a related development, building on operational K-theory developed by Anderson and
Payne, Gonzales in [19] considers operational K-theory of a variety with a torus action. In
this setup, he proves a GKM-type of result for T -skeletal varieties 1. An interesting feature
of operational K-theory is that it provides a far more manageable theory for non-smooth
varieties 2 and this allows Gonzalez to consider non-smooth varieties. However it turns out
that there exist interesting smooth spherical varieties which are not T -skeletal and we feel
that this justiﬁes the present work.

In another direction Joshua and Krishna in [23] establish a spectral sequence which serves
as an eﬀective computational tool in higher T -equivariant K-theory. In particular, let X be
smooth projective scheme with the action of an algebraic torus T satisfying some additional
hypothesis 3 then for any map of diagonalizable groups G → T they establish a spectral
sequence

Ep,q

2 = TorR(T )

p,q

(R(G), Kq([X/T ])) =⇒ Kp+q([X/G])

where R(T ) is the representation ring of the torus T and [X/G] (resp. [X/T ]) is the stacky
quotient. It follows from their constructions that when K0([X/G]) is known then one has
ring isomorphisms K0([X/G]) ⊗Z K∗(k) → K∗([X/G]) which recovers all higher K-theory.
It appears that their work in itself does not provide any new insight into the structure of
K0([X/G]) for a spherical variety. Our approach is substantially diﬀerent and perhaps much
more elementary. It appears that we can provide a more concrete information about the
structure of equivariant K-groups, see Theorem 4.10 for instance. Nonetheless there are some
similarities between the two approaches, compare Propostion 2.6 and Proposition 2.8 with
Theorem 1.2 in [23].

When a variety X is T -skeletal (i.e.

it has ﬁnitely many T -stable points and curves),
GKM-type theorems are often very concrete and they contain additional combinatorial
structures. The T -equivariant K-theory of ﬂag varieties is perhaps the most well known
example, see [21, 25, 22].

The wonderful compactiﬁcation of De Concini and Procesi [12] provides a rich supply of
smooth and projective spherical varieties which are not necessarily toric varieties or ﬂag
varieties. The wonderful compactiﬁcation of minimal rank symmetric varieties is known
to be T -skeletal, see [35]. When G is a semisimple group of adjoint type a complete
classiﬁcation of the irreducible components upto isomorphism is known. These are the
wonderful compactiﬁcations of three families (i) P SL2n/P Spn, (ii) P SO2n/P SO2n−1, (iii)
G (cid:39) G × G/∆G, where ∆G is the diagonal and an exceptional case E6/F4. The most well
studied case in literature is the case of G× G/∆G, the so called group case, see [3, 26, 34, 39].
The equivariant cohomology of these families were extensively studied by Bifet, De Concini
and Procesi in [3] using the setup of regular embeddings. In their seminal paper, among other
things, they associated a Reisner-Stanley system to a regular embedding. More recently,
Strickland used this Reisner-Stanley system to give an explicit presentation of the equivariant
cohomology of wonderful compactiﬁcations of minimal rank symmetric varieties see [34] (also
consider [26]).

1A T -variety X is called T -skeletal if there are ﬁnitely many T -ﬁxed points and T -stable curves in X.
2Operational K-theory agrees with ordinary K-theory for smooth varieties.
3All spherical varieties satisfy these hypothesis.

In the setting of equivariant K-theory, Uma in [39] studied the Grothendieck group of T
(and G) equivariant sheaves in the group case, where she used Reisner-Stanley systems to
explicate the structure of T (and G) equivariant K-theory.

In this paper we use a result, due to Brion and Joshua (see [9]), which gives an explicit
description of the T -ﬁxed points and T -stable curves of the wonderful compactiﬁcation of
minimal rank symmetric varieties, see Proposition 5.2. Using this result we are able to
generalize Uma’s results to all types and moreover we can recover the higher K-groups, see
Section 5.2. This answers some of the questions in [39, Section 3]. We believe our work
provides a diﬀerent perspective on her results.

There are well studied spherical varieties which are not of minimal rank. At present it
appears that there are interesting results about their ordinary cohomology and not much is
known in the equivariant setting. The structure theory of these varieties are more complicated
than the minimal rank and we plan to pursue it in a separate work.

Outline. We now present a detailed outline of the contents of this paper.

In Section 2, we present a collection of results in equivariant K-theory that is going to be
used throughout the paper. We begin by recalling the basic properties of equivariant K-theory
and then establish some general results in the particular case of torus actions. Subsequently
we recall Vezzosi and Vistoli’s treatment of equivariant K-theory of toric varieties and use it
to concretely compute some cases that will be used in sequel.

In Section 3, we study, using the notation of Theorem 1.1, the geometric structure of the
ﬁxed point locus X S. We show that irreducible components of these loci turn out to be
projective rank one spherical varieties studied by Aheizer in [1].

Subsequently in Section 4, we show how one can compute the equivariant K-theory of a
spherical variety by combining the results of the previous two sections. We begin by explicitly
computing the T -equivariant K-theory of some rank one spherical varieties borrowing heavily
from the toric computations established in Section 2. Then we show how to establish Theorem
1.2 by bootstrapping these cases. We consider the (well known) case of complete ﬂag varieties
as a demonstration of our results. Finally we recall the Merkurjev spectral sequence, that
allows one to compute ordinary K-theory from equivariant K-theory.

In the following section, Section 5, we begin by recalling some structure theory of wonderful
compactiﬁcations of symmetric varieties of minimal rank. We establish, using their structure
theory and the analysis of their torus invariant points and curves due to Brion and Joshua
(see Proposition 5.2), the structure of their equivariant K-theory. In the particular group
case we show how our results generalize Uma’s work. Our analysis allows us to establish a
(module) basis of the T -equivariant K-theory over the G-equivariant K-theory and give a
give a formula of their structure constants. Inspired by the work of Griﬀeth and Ram in [22]
(also see Graham and Kumar in [21]), we show in Section 5.2.1, that this basis is not positive
and this is related to the failure of positivity of the Steinberg basis.

In the non-equivariant setting, Riemann-Roch formalism gives an isomorphism between
the Grothendieck group of coherent sheaves and the Chow ring, see Fulton [18, Theorem
18.3]. The equivariant version has been established by Edidin and Graham in [15]. It turns
out that a necessary feature of equivariant setting is that it is necessary to work with certain
completions of the rational K-theory as well as the rational Chow-cohomology. However, we
found the similarity of Brion’s results in [8, Theorem 7.3] and ours extremely suggestive and

4

in Section 5.3 we show that how in certain cases 4 one can recover structure of Chow-rings
from K-theory computations, as is expected from the classical (non-equivariant) setup.

Finally in the short appendix we present some remarks about the Steinberg basis. We
believe that this is well known to the experts but we were unable to ﬁnd it in the literature.

1.0.1. Assumptions/ Notations. A variety is a reduced scheme of ﬁnite type deﬁned over an
algebraically closed ﬁeld k of characteristic zero. It is allowed to have irreducible components.
Points of a variety will always mean closed points.

Unless otherwise stated, our linear group G is always connected and reductive. A G-variety

X is a normal variety with an algebraic action of G.

The representable functor, from schemes over k to the category of sets, associated to a
scheme X will be denoted by X. The set X(A) will denote the A valued points of X for any
k-algebra A.

All tensor product of rings and modules will be over Z unless speciﬁed.

2. Background Results in K-theory

Equivariant algebraic K-theory is developed by Thomason in [38]. In this theory one
studies Quillen’s construction on the category of equivariant sheaves on a G-scheme X. Its
objects are deﬁned as follows.
Deﬁnition 2.1. [38, Section 1.2] Let a denote the action map G × X → X and let pX :
G× X → X denote the second projection. A G-equivariant sheaf on X is a pair (F, φ) where
F is a coherent sheaf on X and φ is an isomorphism φ : a∗F → p∗
XF of sheaves on G × X,
which satisﬁes the natural cocycle condition on G × G × X ⇒ G × X.

A morphism of equivariant sheaves (F, φ) and (F(cid:48), φ(cid:48)) is a morphism of sheaves which
commutes with isomorphisms φ and φ(cid:48). We denote the category of G-equivariant sheaves on
X by ShG(X). This is a small exact category. In this paper our main object of study will be
the K-theory of equivariant sheaves on smooth projective spherical varieties.

The equivariant K-groups admit various functorialities with respect to equivariant maps
of spaces and homomorphisms of the structure group G. These results are well known and
we recommend [11] for a quick summary. A basic feature of G-equivariant K-theory is
that it is canonically a K∗(k) ⊗ R(G) module, where R(G) is the the Grothendieck ring of
representations of G over the base ﬁeld k and K∗(k) is the K-theory of the underlying ﬁeld.

We start with a general proposition that allows us to simplify the underlying group G.

Proposition 2.2 (Faddeev-Shapiro Lemma, [29]). Let H be a closed subgroup of an algebraic
group G. Then for any G-variety X, the inclusion X (cid:44)→ X × G/H deﬁned by x (cid:55)→ (x, eH)
induces the isomorphisms

KG,n(X × G/H) (cid:39) KH,n(X),

for all n ≥ 0.
Remark 2.3. Notice that we do not assume reductivity of G in the above proposition.

For a given Borel subgroup B ⊂ G, let T ⊆ B denote a maximal torus and let U ⊂ B be
the maximal unipotent subgroup of B. Since U is an aﬃne space as a variety, say U (cid:39) An
for some n > 0, by the homotopy invariance property of K-theory (see [38, Theorem 4.1], )
and by the Faddeev-Shapiro Lemma we see that KB,n(X) (cid:39) KB,n(X × B/T ) (cid:39) KT,n(X).
Proposition 2.4 (Merkurjev, [29]). Let G be a (split) reductive group and B a Borel subgroup
and X be a smooth projective G-variety then the natural map

θ : R(B) ⊗R(G) KG,n(X) → KB,n(X)

is an isomorphism for all n ≥ 0.
Remark 2.5. In particular, we have

KT (X) = R(T ) ⊗R(G) KG(X).

When G is simply connected, a result of Steinberg (see [33]) shows that

R(G) (cid:39) R(T )W and R(T ) (cid:39) R(G) ⊗Z Z[W ],

where W is the Weyl group of (G, T ). Here, the ﬁrst isomorphism is an isomorphism of rings
and the latter is only an isomorphism of R(G)-modules. Consequently, we recover KG(X) as
the space of W -invariants in KT (X).

We show that for torus actions Proposition 2.2 takes a particularly nice form. We are

grateful to Dan Edidin for providing a proof of this proposition.
Proposition 2.6. Let T be an algebraic torus and T (cid:48) ⊂ T is a codimension one subtori. Let
X be a smooth projective T -variety. Then the canonical map
R(T (cid:48)) ⊗R(T ) KT,n(X) → KT (cid:48),n(X)

is an isomorphism.
Proof. Let L be a one-dimensional representation of T such that L \ {0} = T /T (cid:48). Let j
denote the obvious map j : X × T /T (cid:48) (cid:44)→ X × L, and p : X × L → X denote the projection
map. The pullback map p∗ : KT,n(X) → KT,n(X × L) is an isomorphism by the homotopy
invariance property of K-theory, [16, Theorem 11]. Also, we have the following commutative
diagram:

(1)

KT,n(X)

KT,n(X × T /T (cid:48))

KT (cid:48),n(X)

where res is the canonical restriction map induced by ShT (X) → ShT (cid:48)(X). The vertical
equality is a consequence of Proposition 2.2.

Thanks to [16, V.2, Corollary 27], in the top horizontal row above, the map res is split
exact and the the kernel of res is generated by the ideal (1 − χ) in KT,n(X) where χ ﬁts into
a short exact sequence

1 → T (cid:48) → T

χ→ Gm → 1.

As a result, we have

KT (cid:48),n(X) = KT,n(X)/(1 − χ)KT,n(X) = R(T (cid:48)) ⊗R(T ) KT,n(X).

(cid:3)
Corollary 2.7. Let T be an algebraic torus and T (cid:48) is any subtorus. Let X be any smooth
projective T -variety then the canonical map R(T (cid:48)) ⊗R(T ) KT,n(X) → KT (cid:48),n(X) is an isomor-
phism.
Sketch of the proof. We use induction on the codimension of T (cid:48). Let us choose a chain of
subtorus

T (cid:48) = T0 ⊂ T1 ⊂ ··· ⊂ Tr = T

such that each Ti is codimension one in Ti+1. The assertion follows by using Lemma 2.6
(cid:3)
inductively at each step.
Proposition 2.8. Let T (cid:48) ⊂ T be subtorus. Let X be a T variety such that T (cid:48) acts trivially
on X. Then we have an isomorphism KT,∗(X) ∼= R(T ) ⊗R(T /T (cid:48)) KT /T (cid:48),∗(X).
of T (cid:48) and let (cid:98)χ denote the unique lift of this character to T which is trivial on T /T (cid:48).
Proof. The torus T /T (cid:48) acts on X and the groups KT /T (cid:48),∗(X) are deﬁned. Let χ be a character

We consider the commutative diagram

functors a∗ ∼= π∗a∗ and pr∗

T × X to T and prX denote the projection to X.

∼= π∗pr∗

Next, we introduce the notion of “χ-twist” of an equivariant sheaf (F, µ) ∈ ShT /T (cid:48)(X). To

this end, let χ be a character of T (cid:48) and consider the map
(2)

T ((cid:98)χ) · π∗(µ) : a∗(F) → pr∗

χ · µ ..= pr∗

X(F).

(cid:40)
0
HomShT /T(cid:48) ((F, µ), (G, λ))

Observe that for any character η of T the regular function pr∗

T (η) is an invertible function
on T × X therefore in the above equation (2) χ · µ is an isomorphism of sheaves. Therefore
(F, χ · µ) is a T -equivariant sheaf on X.

The following assertion follows from the deﬁnition of morphisms of equivariant sheaves:

if χ (cid:54)= χ(cid:48)
if χ = χ(cid:48)

HomShT (X)((F, χ · µ), (G, χ(cid:48) · λ)) =

(3)
The construction deﬁnes a functor Tχ : ShT /T (cid:48)(X) → ShT (X) and we call Tχ(F) the χ-twist
of F. Let ShT (X)χ denote the subcategory Tχ(ShT /T (cid:48)(X)) of ShT (X). We observe obvious
equivalences of categories
(4)

∼=−→ ShT (X)χ(cid:48)·χ = Tχ(cid:48)·χ(ShT /T (cid:48)(X)).

Tχ(cid:48) : ShT (X)χ

The map of group schemes T → T /T (cid:48) is faithfully ﬂat by [42, Theorem 14.1], so the functor
π∗ induces an equivalence between the category of sheaves Sh(X × T /T (cid:48)) and Sh(X × T )
(see [5, Chapter 6]). Let D denote the inverse equivalence. Then given any equivariant sheaf
(F, α) in ShT (X) we get an isomorphism

D(α) : a∗(F) → pr∗

X(F)

of sheaves on X × T /T (cid:48). This makes (F,D(α)) into a T /T (cid:48)-equivariant sheaf. The functor
π∗ also preserves equivariant sheaves. In particular it is identical to the functor Tχe, where
χe is the trivial character, on equivariant sheaves.
Let us consider the abelian subcategory category C of ShT (X) whose objects are T -
equivariant sheaves (F, χ · D(α)) for any character χ of T (cid:48) and morphisms

HomC((F, χ · D(α)), (G, χ(cid:48) · D(α))) ..= HomShT (X)((F, χ · D(α)), (G, χ(cid:48) · D(α)))

(see eqn. (3) above).
Then C is equivalent to ShT (X) since any object (F, µ) in ShT (X) is of the form (F, χe ·
D(µ)) and the Hom-sets in ShT (X) are graded by the lattice of characters of T (cid:48). Thus the
K-theory of ShT (X) is the same as the K-theory of C.
We recall Quillen’s Q-construction which deﬁnes higher K-groups of an exact category
A as the homotopy groups of the classifying space BQ(A); see [43] for details. Using the
description of the category C we note that BQ(C) is a disjoint Hom(T (cid:48), Gm)-fold covering
space of BQ(ShT /T (cid:48)(X)). The functors Tχ in eqn. (4) induce an action of R(T (cid:48)) on BQ(C).
By taking homotopy groups we get that KT,∗(X) = KT /T (cid:48),∗(X) ⊗K∗(k) R(T (cid:48)).
The module KT /T (cid:48),∗(X) is an R(T /T (cid:48)) module and R(T ) = R(T (cid:48)) ⊗ R(T /T (cid:48)). This proves
the assertion.

2.1. Equivariant K-theory of toric varieties. In our work the equivariant K-theory
of some smooth toric surfaces ﬁgure prominently. In this section we recall some results
about their presentation. We follow Vezzosi and Vistoli in [41, §6] which gives a GKM type
presentation (see Remark 2.9 below) and a Reisner-Stanley type presentation (see Proposition
2.11 below) of the complete equivariant K-theory.

We recall some basic results from the theory of toric varieties to establish the notation.
Our reference for this section is [17]. Let T be an algebraic torus and we denote its
lattice of characters (respectively, co-characters) by MT (respectively, by NT ). Recall that
R(T ) = Z[MT ] and T = Homgp(MT , Gm). Given any homomorphism φ : T (cid:48) → T we have
a map φ∗ : Z[MT ] → Z[MT (cid:48)] which makes Z[MT (cid:48)] a Z[MT ] module. When φ is a closed
embedding the induced map φ∗ : MT → MT (cid:48) is surjective. We associate the subgroup
T (cid:48) ⊂ MT which consists of all characters of T that are trivial on T (cid:48) and we have an
M⊥
isomorphism MT = MT (cid:48) ⊕ M⊥
T (cid:48). When the underlying torus is clear from context we will
drop the subscript T from the (co)character lattices.
Let NR denote N ⊗ R, the real vector space spanned by the cocharacters of a torus. A toric
variety is a partial a compactiﬁcation X(∆) of the torus T = Homgp(M, Gm) in terms of a
rational fan ∆ ⊂ NR. Let ∆1 denote the set of all one dimensional cones of ∆. We restrict
ourselves to toric varieties X(∆) which are (i) smooth and (ii) proper; these correspond to the
conditions (i) ∆1 forms a lattice basis of N in the real vector space NR and (ii) the support
of the fan |∆| is all of NR.
Given a cone σ ∈ ∆, there is an associated torus orbit Oσ ⊂ X(∆). Let M (σ) = σ⊥ ∩ M
denote the subspace of characters trivial on σ. One can identify the stabilizer of a geometric
point in Oσ with the torus Homgp(M/M (σ), Gm). This shows that dimR(Oσ) = codimR(σ);
in particular cones of maximal dimension in ∆ correspond to the torus ﬁxed points and
the cones of codimension one correspond to T - stable curves. The isomorphism of spaces
Oσ = T /Tσ gives us an identiﬁcation of

KT,∗(Oσ) = KT,∗ ⊗ R(T /Tσ) = K∗(k) ⊗ R(Tσ) = K∗(k)[M (σ)].

A consequence of Theorem 1.1 is that the map of algebras

where ∆max is the set of maximal cones in ∆, is an injective map of R(T ) modules. Moreover
an element

is in the image of this homomorphism if and only if for any two maximal cones σ1 and σ2 the
restrictions of aσ1 and aσ2 to R(Tσ1∩σ2) coincide.
Remark 2.9. Theorem 1.1 for toric varieties demonstrates that the structure of equivariant
K-groups is encoded in a graph whose vertices are the torus ﬁxed points and edges the torus
ﬁxed curves. This is a direct K-theoretic analog of [20, Theorem 1.2.2] for manifolds with a
torus action.
T (cid:48) ⊂ T a codimension one torus then there is a unique generator of χσ1∩σ2 of M⊥
mod (1 − χσ1∩σ2) for maximal cones σ1 and σ2.

In particular, if we ﬁx identiﬁcations of Tσ with T for any maximal cone σ and Tσ1∩σ2 with
T (cid:48). Then an
K∗(k) ⊗ R(Tσ) belongs to KT,∗(X(∆)) if and only if fσ1 − fσ2 = 0

A presentation of K-theory in this form will be called GKM presentation.

Remark 2.10. We note in passing that one can consider a sheaﬁﬁed version of equivariant
K-groups on toric varieties and use the techniques developed in [37] to extend these results
to not necessarily smooth projective varieties.

This approach is taken in [2].

The above description of K-groups does not explicitly give generators of the algebra (or
modules) over K∗(k) (or R(T )). The situation is better when X(∆) is a smooth toric variety.
In this case there is a more explicit multiplicative Reisner-Stanley representation. Reisner-
Stanley presentation of equivariant cohomology of regular embeddings was ﬁrst studied by
Biﬀet, De Concini and Procesi in [3] and later for symmetric varieties by Strickland in [34].

Proposition 2.11 (The Reisner-Stanley presentation). Let X(∆) be a smooth toric variety.
If ∆1 denotes the set of all one dimensional cones of ∆, then there is an isomorphism of
K∗(k)-algebras

where the product is taken over all subsets S ⊆ ∆1 satisfying the condition:
(6)

the elements of S are not all contained in a maximal cone in ∆.

We refer the reader to [41, Theorem 6.4] for a proof of the above proposition. We note
however that a priori there is no R(T ) module structure on the ring on the left. The proof of
this theorem does give the explicit image of the generators xρ and it is possible to trace the
R(T ) module action explicitly in simple cases as we are going to demonstrate below. This
module structure will be useful in sequel so we recall the explicit map i on the generators
below.
We denote the one dimensional cones by ρ and the generator of the one dimensional integral
semigroup ρ ∩ N by vρ. Consider any maximal cone σ in the fan ∆ and let ρ1, ρ2, . . . , ρk
denote its one dimensional faces. The smoothness of X(∆) ensures that ρ1, ρ2, . . . , ρk form
an integral basis of N. The dual generators v∨

form an integral basis of M.

3. Torus actions on Spherical varieties

We consider a G-variety X satisfying the underlying assumptions in Section 1.0.1. In this
section we will analyze the structure of the irreducible components of the ﬁxed point locus
X S of particular diagonalizable subgroups S of G.
More precisely, for any G-variety X and any closed subgroup S ⊂ G we consider the

functor X S which associates to any aﬃne k-scheme A the set

X S(A) = {x ∈ X(A) |s · x = x for any s ∈ S(A)} .

The functor X S is a representable closed sub-functor of X. The ﬁxed point locus of S on X
is the closed subscheme X S of X, representing X S, with the reduced scheme structure.

We recall some standard results about reductive algebraic groups over ﬁelds. The main

reference for these results is the book [4].
Deﬁnition 3.1. Let S be any torus in G. Then S is called regular is S contains a regular
element of G and S is called singular if S is contained in inﬁnitely many Borel subgroups of
G.
Remark 3.2. We note that Borel in [4, IV,§13.1] deﬁnes a more general notion of a semi-regular
torus which gives a tautological classiﬁcation. However it turns out that for reductive groups
a semi-regular torus is in fact regular; see [4, IV , §13.7, Cor. 2]. As a result we have a
dichotomy: a torus S is either regular or singular.

A maximal torus T of G is always regular. A maximal singular subtorus S is necessarily a
codimension one subtorus. Let T be a maximal torus of G containing a maximal singular
subtorus S. In this case there is a root α of G (which depends on T ) such that S equals the
connected component of Ker(α).
3.0.4. Centralizers. We recall the structure of the centralizer CG(S) of a codimension one
torus S in a reductive group G. We ﬁx a maximal torus T of G containing S. It is known
that CG(S) is a connected reductive group. When S is regular then CG(S) is the maximal
torus T containing S. When S is singular, then CG(S) has semisimple rank one. If B is any
Borel subgroup of G such that S normalizes B then CB(S) is a Borel subgroup of CG(S) and
conversely any Borel subgroup of CG(S) is of the form CB(S).

14

3.1. Spherical Varieties.
Deﬁnition/Proposition 3.3. [6] Let X be a G-variety and B denote a Borel subgroup of
G. Then X is a spherical variety if any of the following equivalent conditions hold.

(1) The B-invariant rational functions on X are constant functions.
(2) The minimal codimension of a B-orbit in X is zero i.e. X has an open B-orbit.
(3) X has ﬁnitely many B-orbits.

A homogeneous spherical variety is a homogeneous space G/H which is also a spherical
G-variety.

The maximal G-orbit of a spherical variety X is a homogeneous spherical variety G/H
and this is equivalent to the condition that the subvariety B · H is open in G. Clearly the
subset B · H is open in G. The subgroups H ⊂ G satisfying this property are called spherical
subgroups. Condition (3) deﬁning a spherical variety above shows that the closure of a G-orbit
inside a spherical variety is a spherical variety.

The set of B-eigenvalues of the eigenvectors in k(X), the ﬁeld of rational functions on X,
is a ﬁnitely generated sublattice of the lattice of characters of B. The rank of this lattice is
an invariant of the spherical variety X and we will denote it by r(X).

3.1.1. Torus action on spherical varieties. A maximal torus T of G acts on a spherical
G-variety X. It turns out that the ﬁxed point set X T is ﬁnite. Indeed, let x be a torus ﬁxed
point in X with stabilizer Hx and we consider the closure of its G orbit G · x in X. We know
that G · x is a spherical variety and we can identify the Zariski tangent space at mx,G·x/m2
x,G·x
G-equivariantly with the lie algebra g/hx with adjoint action. A nontrivial T -ﬁxed subvariety
containing x corresponds to a nontrivial T ﬁxed and hence B-ﬁxed subspace (g/hx)B. Any
non-trivial vector in this subspace lifts to a rational B-ﬁxed function f on G · x which
contradicts the fact that G · x is a spherical variety.
Remark 3.4. If X is complete then Borel Fixed Point Theorem shows that X T is nonempty.
In particular, X T has at least dim(X) + 1 points, [4, Theorem 10.2, IV].

We consider the action of a codimension one torus S on a spherical variety X. Let T
denote a maximal torus containing S. The ﬁxed point locus X S is stable under the action of
the centralizer CG(S). The structure of X S, somewhat unsurprisingly, depends on whether S
is regular or singular.
Lemma 3.5. With the notation as above let B be any Borel subgroup of G which contains
T . Let x be a S ﬁxed point of X. The intersection of B · x with the ﬁxed point loci X S is the
CB(S) orbit CB(S) · x.
Proof. It is clear that CB(S) · x ⊆ B · x ∩ X S.

Let us ﬁx a realization, à la Springer [32, Chapter 8], of G with respect to the root system
Φ ..= Φ(G, T ) and Φ+ is the subset of positive roots. This gives us a family of homomorphisms
ϕα : Ga → G, indexed by α ∈ Φ, such that for any t ∈ T we get t · ϕα · t−1 = uα(α(t) · x).
The Borel subgroup B admits a decomposition B = T U and U is generated by the images
of (ϕα)α∈Φ+. To prove the converse assertion let y ∈ B · x ∩ X S. Then y = b0 · x for some
b0 ∈ B. We write b0 = t0 · u0 where t0 ∈ T , u0 ∈ U and we can moreover assume u0 = ϕα(z0)
for some z0 ∈ Ga.

15

We have

s · b0 · s−1 = t0 · ϕα(α(s)z0).
When α is a nontrivial character of S we have, for any s ∈ S,

When S is a singular torus and α is a root such that S ⊂ Ker(α) then clearly b0 ∈ CB(S).

y = s · y = t0ϕα(α(s)z0) · x = lim
s→0

t0ϕα(α(s)z0) · x = t0 · x.

This shows that we can write y = t0 · x for some t0 ∈ T and the conclusion follows.

(cid:3)

Corollary 3.6. We continue to use the notation of Lemma 3.5. In this case, if Y is any
irreducible component of X S then Y is a spherical CG(S)-variety.
Proof. The variety Y is a connected, hence irreducible, component of X S. Hence it is a
normal variety. The group CG(S) is connected, so it stabilizes Y . The ambient variety X is
spherical hence it has ﬁnitely many B-orbits; therefore the above lemma shows that Y has
(cid:3)
ﬁnitely many CB(S) orbits. Hence Y is a spherical CG(S) variety.
Corollary 3.7. We continue with the notation of Corollary 3.6. The variety Y has a
dimension at most two and as a CG(S)-spherical variety it has rank r(Y ) at most one.
Proof. A natural bound on dimension of Y comes from the dimension of CG(S). The assertion
is clear when the quotient CG(S)/S has dimension one. Consider the case when dim(CG(S)/S)
is greater than one and S is necessarily a singular torus. Since Y is a spherical variety one
can compute the dimension and rank by considering the open G-orbit.
The center ZS of CG(S) is contained in S by [4, Corollary 2(d), §13.16, IV]. Hence the action
of CG(S) on Y factors through the derived semisimple group GS
..= [CG(S), CS(S)]. Let BS
denote the derived Borel subgroup and HS denote the stabilizer of a generic point in the open
GS orbit in Y . The group CG(S) has semisimple rank one and hence GS = SL2 or P SL2.
The dimension of Y is bounded by the dimension of BS which is two. In this case the rank
of BS is at most the rank of its character lattice which is one.
(cid:3)
3.2. Rank one spherical varieties. A complete classiﬁcation of rank one spherical varieties
is available, see [1, 7] for details. When G is SL2 or P SL2
5the classiﬁcation is classical and it
depends on enumerating the spherical subgroups of G. These rank one compactiﬁcations will
be used in sequel so we recall the spherical subgroups, equivariant compactiﬁcations and the
boundary of the open G orbit in Table 1.
Let us return to the notation of the proof of Corollary 3.7. Let y0 be a generic point in the
open G orbit and consider the orbit map ϕ : G/H → Y given by g (cid:55)→ g · y. Let X denote
one of the equivariant compactiﬁcations in the Table 1 (depending on H). We consider the
birational G-equivariant map ϕ : X (cid:57)(cid:57)(cid:75) Y . The map ϕ is possibly undeﬁned in a codimension
two locus by Zariski’s Main Theorem. When X is two-dimensional the boundary is one
dimensional so the birational map ϕ extends by G-equivariance to the boundary.
When X is not the surface P1×P1 the boundary curves are not contractible (−1) curves and
X is a minimal model. So the map ϕ is necessarily an isomorphism. In the case X = P1 × P1
any contractible curve necessarily intersects the dense G orbit. Hence the map ϕ is an
isomorphism.

5We use G to distinguish the base case that is calculated explicitly in Section 4.1. The case of arbitrary

reductive group G depends on these calculations.

Proposition 3.8 ( Section 7.1 [8] ). Suppose S ⊂ T is a codimension one subtorus, and let
Y ⊆ X S be an irreducible. Then upto isomorphism Y is one of the following varieties.
1) a point,
2) a smooth P1,
3) a projective plane on which CG(S) acts through the projectivization of the non-trivial 3
4) a Hirzebruch surface Fn = P(OP1 ⊕ OP1(n)), on which CG(S) acts through the natural

action of SL2.

4. K-Theory of Spherical Varieties

We continue with notation from the preceding section.

4.1. Rank one case. Our main goal here is to ﬁrst compute the T -equivariant K-theory of
rank one G spherical varieties using computations in Section 2.1. We begin by ﬁrst explaining
our strategy.
Let X denote any of the two dimensional compactiﬁcations from Table 1. It is well known
that any such X is a 2-dimensional toric variety. Let T b denote the two dimensional big torus
of X and T denote a maximal torus of G.
We construct a closed embedding i : T (cid:44)→ T b which makes the identity map id : X → X

equivariant; in other words the following diagram:

(7)

The structure of KT b,∗(X ) is well understood from the computations in Section 2.1 and
since R(T ) is the ring of Laurent polynomials in one variable this tensor product is explicit.

We ﬁx co-ordinates which identiﬁes T with the maximal torus

and R(T ) = Z[χ±]. We identify R(T b) with Z[χ±

2.1.
The key to constructing the embedding i : T (cid:44)→ T b is the fact that for all varieties, listed
in Table 1, the complement of the open G orbit is a G stable hypersurface. The detailed
constructions are due to Ahiezer [1].
4.1.1. The case of X = P(sl2). We identify the coordinates [x0 : x1 : x2] on P(sl2) with
modulo scalars. The torus T b acts on P2 is by t · [x0 : x1 :
trace zero matrices:
x2] = [x0 : χ1(t) · x1 : χ2(t) · x2] and the torus T acts on sl2 by conjugation action. The
complement of the open G orbit is isomorphic to the quadric x2
0 + x1x2 = 0. We conclude that
the embedding i : T (cid:44)→ T b is given by t (cid:55)→ (t, t−1). The induced map on the representation
rings is given by

The following proposition is immediate from Proposition 2.6 and the GKM presentation in
Section 2.3.1.
Proposition 4.1. The T equivariant K-theory of P2 is given by 3-tuples (f1, f2, f3) where,
fi (for i = 1, 2, 3) belongs to the ring K∗(k)[χ±], which satisﬁes the conditions

f1 − f2 = 0 mod (1 − χ), f1 − f3 = 0 mod (1 − χ), and f2 − f3 = 0 mod (1 − χ2).

4.1.2. The case of X = P1 × P1. The diagonal P1 in X is the boundary of the open G-orbit.
The diagonal intersects the dense T b orbit. As a result, the only map of tori that preserves the
boundary of the compactiﬁcation is the diagonal map. The induced map on the representation
rings is given by

fi − fj = 0 mod (1 − χ) for i, j ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}.

Proposition 4.3. The T equivariant K-theory of Fn is given by a 4-tuple of elements in
(f1, f2, f3, f4), where fi (for i = 1, 2, 3, 4) belong to the ring K∗(k)[χ±], which satisﬁes the
conditions
f1 − f2 = 0 mod (1 − χ), f2 − f3 = 0 mod (1 − χ2n), f3 − f4 = 0 mod (1 − χ),

and f4 − f1 = 0 mod (1 − χn).
In our next proposition we compute the corresponding Reisner-Stanley presentations of

the T -equivariant K-theories of these surfaces.

Proof. The proposition follows from the fact that, using the notation at the beginning of
Section 4.1, we have a presentation R(T ) = R(T b)/I. As a result, by using Proposition 2.6
we get a presentation of the equivariant groups KT,∗(·) = KT b,∗(·)/I. The presentation of
the ideal I then follows from the explicit calculations of the R(T b) module structure on the
Resiner-Stanley presentation carried out in Sections 2.3.1 - 2.3.3.

We work out the case of P2 and the other two cases are similar. We get, using Section

4.2. Weyl group action. The Weyl group of G acts on the set of torus ﬁxed points and
the G equivariant K-theory is the ring of invariants.
We ﬁrst consider the important case when G is semisimple rank one. Let w0 denote the
non trivial element in the Weyl group. It permutes the torus ﬁxed points, thereby it acts
on the ring K∗(k)[χ±
σ ] (recall the notation used in Section 2.3 ). This action will be made
precise in the Proposition 4.5 below.
Recall that associated to each maximal cone σ of a fan ∆ there is a unique torus ﬁxed
point in the toric variety X(∆). Let us denote this torus ﬁxed point by xσ. Let e ∈ X(∆) be
any point in the dense torus T of X(∆). The point xσ is also the limit of the one parameter
orbit ν(t) · e where ν is any cocharacter in the interior of the cone σ.

We use the notations from Section 2.1 and Figures 2, 3 and 4 in the proposition below.
Proposition 4.5. Let w0 be the non-trivial element of the Weyl group of G. Then the w0
action on the compactiﬁcations X are given as follows.

w0←→ xσ13.

(1) If X = P1 then w0 permutes the two torus ﬁxed point.
(2) If X = P2 then w0(xσ12) = xσ12 and w permutes the other two torus ﬁxed points i.e.
w0←→ xσ34 and it leaves the other two torus ﬁxed points xσ23
(3) If X = P1 × P1 then xσ12
and xσ14 invariant.
(4) If X = Fn then xσ12
w0←→ xσ34 and it leaves the other two torus ﬁxed points xσ23 and

xσ23

xσ14 invariant.

Proof. Let X be as in the hypothesis. The ﬁrst case is well-known. The embedding i : T → T b,
considered in the diagram (7), deﬁnes a cocharacter in NT b. Let us denote this cocharacter
by i. We have a decomposition of lattices NT = Z · i ⊕ Z · i⊥. We extend the action of w to
NT by deﬁning w(i) = −i and w(i⊥) = i⊥. Any cocharacter of λ ∈ NT b decomposes uniquely
as n · i + m · i⊥. Hence we can calculate the w action by
w(λ)(t)

w(xσ) = lim
t→0

where λ is a cocharacter in the interior of σ. The proof of the proposition is now an easy
consequence of calculating the cocharacter i ∈ NT b. This is done in Section 4.1.
(cid:3)
This allows us to completely calculate the G-equivariant K-theory of rank one G wonderful

varieties.

Proposition 4.6. Let X be a rank one wonderful compactiﬁcation of G. Then its G equi-
variant K-theory is given as follows.

(1) If X = P1 then KG,∗(X ) = K∗(k) ⊗ R(T ).
(2) If X = P2, the KG,∗(X ) is given by a collection of elements in (f1, f2) in the ring

i=1 K∗(k)[χ±] which satisﬁes the condition

f1 − f2 = 0 mod (1 − χ).

(3) If X = P1 × P1, then KG,∗(X ) is given by a collection of elements (f1, f2, f3) in the

i=1 K∗(k)[χ±] which satisﬁes the condition

fi − fj = 0 mod (1 − χ) for all i, j ∈ {1, 2, 3}.

(4) If X = Fn, then KG,∗(X ) is given by a collection of elements in (f1, f2, f3) in the ring

i=1 K∗(k)[χ±] which satisﬁes the conditions

f1 − f2 = 0 mod (1 − χ2n), and f3 − f1 = 0 mod (1 − χn).

We consider the third part. Let (f1, f2, f3, f4) be an element in (cid:81)4

Proof. The ﬁrst assertion is well known and see Example 4.11 below for an outline of the proof.
The second and the third part of this proposition are direct consequences of Proposition 4.5,
Proposition 4.2 and Proposition 4.1.
i=1 K∗(k)[χ±] which
satisﬁes the conditions of Proposition 4.5. After taking invariants described in Proposition 4.5,
we note that the additional relations f1 = f3 and hence f3 − f2 = f1 − f2 = 0 mod (1 − χ2n)
(cid:3)
are imposed. This proves the proposition.
Remark 4.7. The Weyl group action can be transferred to the Reisner-Stanley presentations
in Proposition 4.4. It turns out that the action is not very well adapted to the variables xρ.
We will not use this action so we omit the details.
4.3. General results. In general one cannot hope to prove a result as explicit as Proposition
4.6 for a general smooth projective spherical variety. We have the following result.
Theorem 4.8. Let X be a smooth projective spherical G-variety. Let T be a maximal torus
of G. Then the set of T ﬁxed points X T is ﬁnite and the T equivariant K-theory KT,∗(X)
x∈X T K∗(k) ⊗ R(T )x which are subject to the
• fx − fy = 0 mod (1− χ) when x and y are connected by a T -invariant curve of weight
• fx − fy = fx − fz = 0 mod (1 − χ) and fy − fz = 0 mod (1 − χ2) where χ is a
root and an irreducible component of the subvariety XKer(χ) which contains the points
x, y, z is isomorphic to P2. There is an element in the Weyl group of G that ﬁxes x
and permutes the point y and z.
• fx − fy = fy − fz = fz − fw = fx − fw = 0 mod (1 − χ) where χ is a root and an
irreducible component of the subvariety XKer(χ) which contains the points x, y, z, w is
isomorphic to P1 × P1. There is an element in the Weyl group of G that ﬁxes two
points and permutes the other two.
• fx − fy = fz − fw = 0 mod (1 − χ) and fy − fz = 0 mod (1 − χ2n) and fx − fw = 0
mod (1 − χn), where n is an integer, where χ is a root and an irreducible component
of the subvariety XKer(χ) which contains the points x, y, z, w is isomorphic to the ruled

following additional congruences:

surface Fn. There is an element in the Weyl group of G that ﬁxes the points x and w
and permutes z and y.

The G equivariant K-theory is given by the space of W -invariants in the T equivariant
K-groups.
Proof. Let S denote a codimension one subtorus. We know that the irreducible components
of S ﬁxed points X S is either a smooth curve P1 or a G compactiﬁcation.

Using Proposition 2.8 we get an isomorphism of K-groups

KT,∗(X S) = KT /S,∗(X S) ⊗R(T /S) R(T ).

The structure of KT /S,∗(X S) follows from Section 4.1.
We know that the dimension of the subtorus ﬁxed subvariety is greater than one when
S ⊂ T is a singular subtorus. In this case the nontrivial Weyl group element of the centralizer
G lifts to the Weyl group of G.
(cid:3)
Remark 4.9. In [8, §7.3] Brion proves a similar result for the equivariant Chow-rings of
spherical varieties. This provided the main motivation for this paper. However we note that
the K-theory obtained here has integral structure whereas the equivariant Chow groups have
rational structure.

In general one can say a lot more about the structure of particular class of spherical
varieties. As an example, in the case of minimal rank symmetric varieties there all torus
ﬁxed points are connected by curves. In this case one can explicitly present the equivariant
K-theory!

The orbits of the Weyl group inside the torus ﬁxed points have rather involved combina-
torial structure, see [34] for a particular case. While the general picture is not very clear
remarkable results (and conjectures) have been proved (and proposed) in the case of wonderful
compactiﬁcations by Luna [27]. This indicates existence of interesting combinatorial structure
on the equivariant K-groups. The particular case of a group compactiﬁcation was worked
out by Uma in [39]. We wish to pursue some other cases in future.

We will now consider a Reisner-Stanley type presentation of equivariant K-groups. Given
any smooth projective spherical G-variety X we construct a piecewise linear topological space
P L(X) associated to X. The vertices of P L(X) are the torus ﬁxed points X T of X. Two
vertices are joined by an edge if there is a T -invariant curve joining them. Depending on
the variety X, a collection of three or four vertices are joined by a T -stable projective toric
surface (see table 1). To such a collection of points we attach a two dimensional polytope,
which is homothetic to the moment polytope of the corresponding T -stable variety, with
the vertices of the polytope mapping to the respective T -ﬁxed points. There are no higher
dimensional cells. Hence we have a bijection between the positive dimensional cells of P L(X)
and the non-trivial components of the ﬁxed point locus X S of codimension one subtorus S of
T . This is an analogue of the moment graph construction in topological equivariant theories.
There is a Weyl group action on P L(X).
Proposition 4.10 (Reisner-Stanley presentation). Let X be a smooth projective spherical G
variety and let P L(X) be the piecewise linear complex constructed in the preceding paragraph.
Let s be an edge or a two dimensional cell of P L(X) and Xs denote the corresponding
component. Then we have a map of rings

ϕs : KT /S,∗(Xs) ⊗R(T /S) R(T ) → KT,∗(X T ).

22

The image of the colimit of the family of the maps ϕs is identiﬁed with KT,∗(X).

Proof. Consider an irreducible component Xs, belonging to the ﬁxed point locus X S, as-
sociated to a positive dimensional cell s of P L(X). When Xs is isomorphic to P1 the RS
presentation of KT /S,∗(Xs) follows from Section 2.2. When Xs is higher dimensional, similar
presentation of KT /S,∗(Xs) is obtained in Proposition 4.4. In each of these cases (see Section
2.3), we have a map of KT /S,∗(Xs) into KT /S,∗(X T /S
is the torus T /S ﬁxed
point locus of Xs. We have a canonical map of rings

The proposition now follows directly from Theorem 1.1.

(cid:3)

The proof gives an immediate set of generators for KT,∗(X). The G-equivariant K-theory

is obtained by the considering the ring of W -invariants.

Example 4.11. We consider the complete ﬂag variety as a testing ground for comparing
the various presentations of the equivariant K-groups. We ﬁx a connected reductive group
G, a Borel subgroup B and a maximal torus T ⊂ B. This ﬁxes a root system ∆G of G and
we denote the associated Weyl group by W . Given any simple root α ∈ ∆G we denote the
associated element in W by sα. We let B denote the complete ﬂag variety G/B.
We note that, using Proposition 2.2 and the discussion after that we get KG,∗(B) = KB,∗(pt)
and KB,∗(pt) = KT,∗(pt) = K∗(k) ⊗ R(T ).

GKM presentation. The T -ﬁxed points and T -stable curves were described by Carrell in [10,
Theorem F]. It turns out, this data is given by the Bruhat graph WG; the vertices are the
T -ﬁxed points of B hence they are indexed by elements of the Weyl group. Two vertices w
and w(cid:48) are joined by a T -stable curve if w(cid:48) = sα · w for some reﬂection sα and (cid:96)(w) < (cid:96)(w(cid:48)).

w∈W K∗(k) ⊗ R(T ) by shifting the co-ordinates. As a result,
it suﬃces to check the congruences imposed at the identity. Thus any element in KT,∗(B)W
is determined by choosing fe ∈ R(T ). So, KT,∗(B)W = K∗(k) ⊗ R(T ).

RS presentation. We recall the notation used in Proposition 4.10. The piecewise linear space
P L(B) is just the (piecewise linear) realization of the Bruhat graph. Let sα be an edge of the
Bruhat graph joining vertices w0 and w1 = w0 · sα (see Figure 5 below). The component Xsα
is isomorphic to P1. We have RS presentation, following Section 2.2,

To compute the G-equivariant K-theory it suﬃces to look at the intersection of image of
ϕ and the subring K∗(k) ⊗ R(T ) of KT,∗(X T ) corresponding to the identity e ∈ W . The

4.4. Ordinary K-theory of Spherical varieties. One of the classical motivations behind
studying equivariant versions of cohomology theories (such as, cohomology, Chow-cohomology,
and K-theory) is that one can specialize the equivariant theory to compute the classical
cohomology theory. This is known as equivariant formality in a topological setting, see [20,
Section 6.3]. The analogous comparison results between equivariant K-theory and ordinary
K-theory of algebraic G-schemes is undertaken by Merkurjev in [29, Proposition 3.6 and
Theorem 4.2]. In particular he shows that when G is a split algebraic torus T and the
underlying variety X is smooth and projective there is a spectral sequence

degenerating at E2. Moreover under the above assumptions we get an isomorphism
(10)
where Z is a trivial R(T ) module.
Proposition 4.12. Let X be a smooth complete spherical G-variety. Let I denote the
augmentation ideal of R(T ) the representation ring of a maximal torus of G. Then the
ordinary K∗(X) is the quotient of KT,∗(X), by the submodule generated by the elements
I · KT,∗(X).
Remark 4.13. Using Theorem 4.8 we note that ordinary K- theory of a spherical variety is
determined by the structure of its torus ﬁxed points.

5. Applications

In this section, we are going to apply our results to compactiﬁcations of symmetric spaces
of minimal rank. We ﬁrst recall some known facts about symmetric varieties and their
compactiﬁcations without proofs. We recommend the articles [13, 31, 30] as a general
reference and for proof of these assertions.
5.1. Symmetric spaces and their compactiﬁcations. Throughout the rest of this section
G is a connected linear semisimple group of adjoint type unless explicitly mentioned otherwise.
Let θ : G → G be an involutive automorphism and H = Gθ denote the subgroup of θ-ﬁxed
points. The homogeneous space G/H is called a symmetric space. The group H is reductive
and without loss of generality we assume that it is connected 6
The rank of a spherical variety is always constrained by the inequality rank(G) ≥ rank(H)+
rank(G/H). A minimal rank variety is a variety such that the above inequality is an equality
for the open G-orbit. The symmetric spaces considered in this paper are of minimal rank.
Deﬁnition 5.1. A θ split torus of G is a torus S ⊂ G such that θ(s) = s−1 and a θ split
parabolic P of G is a parabolic subgroup such that P ∩ θ(P ) = Levi subgroup of P (and
θ(P )).

It turns out that for reductive groups nontrivial θ split torus always exist. So, we ﬁx a
maximal θ-split torus S and consider a minimal θ split parabolic P . Let L and Pu denote the
Levi and unipotent radical in P respectively. It follows from construction that L = CG(S).
The derived group of L is θ stable and it has no θ split torus. As a result, we conclude that
[L, L] ⊂ H. We ﬁx a maximal torus T of P containing S. As a consequence of the minimal
rank assumption we see that S × (T ∩ H) → T is an isogeny.

Let ΦG and ΦL denote the root system associated to the pairs (G, T ) and (L, T ). The
positive roots and the simple roots are denoted by Φ+
H) and ∆G (resp. ∆L). The
Weyl groups are denoted by WG (resp WL). The involution θ acts on roots and we have a
subset

G (resp. Φ+

Φ−θ ..=(cid:8)α ∈ Φ+

G | θ(α) < 0(cid:9) .

However, since [L, L] ⊂ H the action of θ is trivial on ΦL and WL. It turns out that we have
L of positive roots and correspondingly ∆G = ∆L ∪ ∆−θ for simple
a partition Φ+
roots, where ∆−θ ..= ∆ ∩ Φ−θ.

G = Φ−θ ∪ Φ+

6In the full generality one has to work with a ﬁnite cover of G/H 0 of G/H and then take GIT-quotients.

where ∗2 is the squaring map.
The injective map p : MS → MT on characters identiﬁes MS with the subspace generated
by the vectors α − θ(α). The nonzero vectors i(ΦG) in the image of the surjective map
i : MT → MS generate a (possibly non-reduced) root system denoted by ΦG/H and the image
..= i(∆−θ) is a basis of this system. It turns out that the associated Weyl group WG/H
∆G/H
of the root system equals NH(S)/CH(S). The linear automorphisms of ΦG/H are precisely
the automorphisms of MT that preserve the subspace p(MS). So we conclude that the θ
invariant elements of the Weyl group WG surjects onto WG/H. The partition of the root
system above then shows that
(12)
is exact.

Let us denote T θ ..= T ∩ H which is a maximal torus of H, under our assumptions. The
results of Brion and Joshua in [9, Section 1.4] show that we can identify the root ΦH with a
subset of ΦG and the Weyl group WH identiﬁes with the θ invariant elements of WG. As a
result, in the short exact sequence 12, above we can replace W θ
G by WH. It is also shown in
loc. cit. that the root system ΦG/H is reduced.

G → WG/H → 1

1 → WL → W θ

Let X be the wonderful compactiﬁcation of a minimal rank symmetric space G/H. The
closure of the torus S inside X, denoted by Y , is a toric variety. The fan associated to
this toric variety is the subdivison of the space of NS (the space of S-cocharacters) by the
Weyl chambers. Let Y0 denote the torus invariant aﬃne open sub-set deﬁned by the anti-
fundamental Weyl chamber 7. The Weyl group WG/H acts transitively on MS by construction.
Clearly Y = WG/K · Y0. The cone corresponding to the aﬃne subset Y0 is of maximal
dimension. So it corresponds to a unique torus ﬁxed point z0 ∈ Y0 and the torus ﬁxed points
of Y are parametrized by WG/H · z0.
We know from our analysis in Section 3.1 that ﬁxed point set X S(cid:48) is a homogeneous P SL2
variety. It is not hard to see, in the case of symmetric spaces, that (after possibly replacing
by a conjugate) the involution θ induces an involution on SL2 = NG(S(cid:48))/CG(S(cid:48)). It follows
that the ﬁxed point variety is understood in terms of wonderful symmetric compactiﬁcations
of SL2. The classiﬁcation of all such wonderful symmetric spaces, see below, shows that the
ﬁxed point variety can only be one dimensional. The combinatorial structure of these torus
ﬁxed points and curves is known.
Proposition 5.2 (Lemma 2.1.1 [9]). We continue with the notation above. The torus ﬁxed
points and the curves of wonderful symmetric space X and the toric variety Y admit following
parametrization:
(i) The T -ﬁxed points of X are exactly the points w · z0 where w ∈ WG/WL. The torus

ﬁxed points of Y are exactly w · z0 where w ∈ WH/WL = WG/H.

7This Weyl chamber corresponds to the simple roots −∆G/H.

(ii) For any positive root α ∈ Φ+

L, there exists unique irreducible T -stable curve Cα·z0
connecting z0 and αz0. The torus T acts on Cα·z0 via the character α. The curve is
isomorphic to P1 and we call these curves Type 1 curves.
(iii) For any simple root γ = α − θ(α) ∈ ∆G/H, there exists unique irreducible T -stable curve
Cγ·z0 connecting z0 and sαsθ(α) · z0. The torus T acts on Cγ·z0 by the character γ. The
curve is isomorphic to P1 and we call these curves Type 2 curves.
and Cγ·z0. They are all isomorphic to P1.

(iv) The irreducible T -stable curves in X are precisely the WG-translates of the curves Cα·z0

(v) The irreducible T -stable curves in Y are the WG/H-translates of the curves Cγ·z0.
5.2. K-theory of symmetric spaces. In this section we study the K-theory in the light of
the preceding proposition. Throughout this section X will denote a minimal-rank equivariant
compactiﬁcation and Y will denote the toric variety in Proposition 5.2. We continue use the
notation introduced in the previous section.

The following corollary is a straightforward consequence of Proposition 5.2 and Theorem 4.8.
Corollary 5.3. The T -equivariant K-theory KT,∗(X) of X is isomorphic to the space of

tuples (fw·z0) ∈(cid:81)

w∈WG/WL

K∗(k) ⊗ R(T ) such that

fw·z0 − fw(cid:48)·z0 =

0 mod (1 − α)
0 mod (1 − α · θ(α)−1)

if w−1w(cid:48) = sα
if w−1w(cid:48) = (sα · sθ(α))± .

(cid:40)

tuples (fw·z0) ∈(cid:81)

The T -equivariant K-theory KT,∗(Y ) of the toric variety Y is isomorphic to the space of

w∈WH /WL

K∗(k) ⊗ R(T ) such that

fw·z0 − fw(cid:48)·z0 = 0 mod (1 − α · θ(α)−1) and w−1w(cid:48) = (sα · sθ(α))±.

Next we relate the T -equivariant K-theories of X and Y . To this end, let W H denote the

minimal coset representatives of WG/WH. We have the following proposition.
Proposition 5.4. There is an isomorphism of rings

(cid:89)

w∈W H

KT,∗(Y ) ∼= KT,∗(X).

Moreover this is an isomorphism of K∗(k) ⊗ R(T ) modules.

Proof. Consider the chain of Coxeter groups WL ⊂ WH ⊂ WG. It introduces a map on the
quotient space π : WG/WL → WG/WH. We identify WG/WL (resp. WG/WH) set theoretically
with W L (resp. W H)-the minimal length coset representatives. Let π : W L → W H denote
the induced map of sets.
For any u ∈ W H, let Ru denote the image of the ring homomorphism ϕu deﬁned by the

shows that when u = e0 ∈ W H is the element of length zero (i.e. e0 corresponds to the
coset [WH]) Re0 = KT,∗(Y ). For an arbitrary u ∈ W H, its action on X and X T induces
automorphisms on KT,∗(X) and KT,∗(X T ). These automorphisms induce a ring isomorphism
between Re0 and Ru. This proves the proposition.
(cid:3)

Next we have a corollary describing G-equivariant K-theory. The proposition is a direct

consequence of the previous proposition however we prove it independently.
Corollary 5.5. The G-equivariant K-theory KG,∗(X) of X is isomorphic to WH-invariants
of the T -equivariant K-theory of the toric variety Y .
Proof. Recall that any element in KG,∗(X) = KT,∗(X)WG is identiﬁed with an element
X T K∗(k) ⊗ R(T ) satisfying certain congruences. These congruences are of

(fw)w∈WG/WL in(cid:81)

the type

fw − fw

(cid:48) = 0 mod (1 − χα) when the curve joining w, w
θ(α)) when the curve joining w, w

(cid:48) = 0 mod (1 − χαχ−1

fw − fw

(cid:48) is of Type 1;
(cid:48) is of Type 2.

The congruence condition is invariant with respect to WG/WL- translation action so it
suﬃces to check the congruences at the identity. However we have an identiﬁcation of
G ⊂ WG. The action of WH on a Type 1 curve does not stabilize it but the stabilizer
WH = W θ
of a Type 2 curve is non-trivial in WH (and precisely of order 2). So, to choose an element
(fw) ∈ KG,∗(X) it suﬃces to choose an element fe corresponding to the identity e ∈ WG/WL
and fw(cid:48) for every curve joining the point e and w(cid:48) by a Type 2 curve which also satisﬁes
the congruence condition imposed by the non-trivial stabilizer of the curve. So we have
KT,∗(X)WG = KT,∗(X)WH.

The T -ﬁxed points in the toric variety Y correspond to the Weyl Chambers associated to
the root system ΦG/H, by construction. The T -invariant curves correspond to the walls of the
Weyl chamber, and these are exactly the Type 2 curves in X. We have an action of WG/H on
Y and there is an identiﬁcation of WG/H with WH/WL so the only congruence conditions in
KT,∗(X)WH are exactly the same as those in KT,∗(Y )WH.
(cid:3)

5.2.1. T -equivariant K-theory. The toric variety Y is a compactiﬁcation of the maximal
anisotropic torus S and the torus T /S acts trivially on Y . Applying Proposition 2.8 in this
case shows us that
(14)

KT,∗(Y ) = KS,∗(Y ) ⊗ R(T /S).

In [3, §4], the authors show that one can associate a simplicial-complex CY to a smooth toric
variety Y whose vertices are one-dimensional rays of the fan (corresponding to the codimension-
one torus orbits) and higher dimensional simplices correspond to higher dimensional cones
in the fan of the toric variety8. Using this simplicial complex and the Reisner-Stanley
presentation of K-theory of toric varieties in [41], we obtain a direct sum decomposition
of KS,∗(Y ) = ⊕∆∈CY KS,∗(Y )∆ where KS,∗(Y )∆ is the K∗(k) ⊗ R(S) submodule of KS,∗(Y )
consisting of monomials supported on the sub-toric variety deﬁned by the cone ∆. The
setting in [3] is that of equivariant cohomology but their argument is algebraic and it goes
through in K-theory as well, see [39, Lemma 2.8] for details. As a result we obtain a direct
sum decomposition:

Remark 5.6. In the group case this recovers Lemma 2.8 of [39].
5.2.2. Structure constants. The factor KT,∗(Y ) essentially determines the T -equivariant K-
theory of KT,∗(X). As seen in Section 5.1, the toric variety Y is determined by the reduced
and irreducible root system ΦG/H with Weyl group WG/H. The root system ΦG/H determines
an adjoint algebraic group Γ(ΦG/H). Let BΓ(ΦG/H) denote the complete ﬂag variety of
Γ(ΦG/H). Then, using [24], we can identify the toric variety Y with the closure of the general
torus orbit of the maximal torus in the ﬂag variety BΓ(ΦG/H). The following lemma is
immediate:
Lemma 5.7. Let S denote the maximal torus of Γ(ΦG/H) compatible with the root system
ΦG/H. Then KS,∗(BΓ(ΦG/H)) = KS,∗(Y ).

.

The torus equivariant K-theory of ﬂag variety is a source of many combinatorial structures.
In particular Kostant and Kumar in [25] shows that in the case of the ﬂag variety BΓ(ΦG/H)
there is a remarkable basis, indexed by the Weyl group, called the Schubert basis of torus
equivariant K-theory over the underlying base ring K∗(k) ⊗ R(S). Let us denote this basis
by {[OXw]}w∈WG/H
A consequence of the minimal rank assumption is that the torus T /S appearing in equation
(14) above is the maximal torus of H (= Gθ). In [33], Steinberg discovered an explicit basis
of the ring R(T /S) in terms of the subring R(T )WH. Following Steinberg, this basis will be
denoted by {ew}w∈WH
According to Proposition 5.5, the G equivariant K-theory is obtained by the WH invariants
in KS,∗(Y ) ⊗ R(T /S). Recall that WH equals W θ
G and by equation (12) we know that WH
acts on Y by the quotient WG/H. So we have a basis of KS,∗(Y ) ⊗ R(T /S) over the base ring
K∗(k) ⊗ R(S) ⊗ R(T /S)WH, indexed by WG/H × WH, consisting of elements

are respectively the structure constants of the Schubert and the
Note that in the group case of G × G/∆G the Schubert basis and the Steinberg basis in
the equation (16) above correspond to the Schubert basis and Steinberg basis of the group G
and the indexing sets are all equal that is we have WG×G/∆G = WG.

The Schubert basis (in the equivariant setting) exhibits an interesting positivity phenom-
enon. We recommend the article by Griﬀeth and Ram [22] and Kumar and Graham [21]
for precise statements and conjectures for Schubert basis. In the light of the equation (17),
the positivity in equivariant K-theory would then depend on the structure constant of the
Steinberg basis, which to the best of our knowledge, is not very well studied. In the appendix
we compute the structure constants of type A and rank 2 and conclude that they are not
positive. This combined with the calculation in [22, Section 5] shows that the natural basis
in (16) above is not positive.
5.2.3. G-equivariant K-theory. The Weyl Group WG/H acts transitively on the Weyl chambers
of the root system ΦG/H and as a result the toric variety Y admits a cover by the WG/H-
translates of an aﬃne open set Y0. So we get the equality

This leads to the following structure theorem for G-equivariant K-theory.

KS,∗(Y )WG/H = KS,∗(Y )WH = KS,∗(Y0).

Proposition 5.8. The G-equivariant K-theory of X is

KG,∗(X) = KS,∗(Y0) ⊗ R(T /S)WH .

Proof. In the light of Proposition 5.2, it suﬃces to show KT,∗(Y )WH = KS,∗(Y0) ⊗ R(T /S)WH.
It follows from equation (14) that KS,∗(Y0) ⊗ R(T /S)WH ⊂ KT,∗(Y )WH and we will show
the other inclusion. To this end, let {ew}w∈WH
denote the the Steinberg basis of R(T /S)
forms a basis of KT,∗(Y ) over KS,∗(Y ) ⊗ R(T /S)WH.
over R(T /S)WH. Then {1 ⊗ ew}w∈WH
As noted above WH acts transitively on KS,∗(Y ) so taking WH invariants we get KS,∗(Y0) ⊗
(cid:3)
R(T /S)WH.
Remark 5.9. In the group a case similar decomposition of the Grothendieck group of equivariant
sheaves were obtained by Uma in [39].
5.3. Connections to equivariant intersection theory. In this section we will show an
eﬀective way to calculate the equivariant Chow-ring of smooth projective spherical varieties
from equivariant K-theory. This uses the equivariant Riemann-Roch map deﬁned by Edidin
and Graham in [15].
Notations/Assumptions. Throughout this section we will consider a smooth projective variety
X with the action of a connected linear reductive group G. Let T denote a maximal torus of
G with character lattice M. In contrast to the rest of the paper we will use the Grothendieck
group of T equivariant coherent sheaves on X with rational coeﬃcients by KT,Q(X) ..= KT,0⊗Q
which is a Q[M ](= KT,Q(pt)) module. Similarly the equivariant Chow-rings with rational
coeﬃcients will be denoted by A∗
T,Q(pt) module 9. There
9Our arguments in this section are rather formal. The expert will note that when applicable they extend
trivially to non-smooth spherical varieties using operational Chow-groups. These have been deﬁned by Edidin
and Graham [14].

of T ﬁxed points of X is ﬁnite and the natural restriction maps KT,Q(X) → KT,Q(X T ) and
T,Q → A∗

T,Q(X T ) are injective. When X is a smooth spherical G-variety these conditions

Deﬁnition 5.10. Continuing with the above notation we say that the equivariant K-theory
of X is commensurable if the embedding of KT,Q(X) → KT,Q(X T ) is deﬁned by ﬁnitely many
congruence conditions of the form fi = fj mod pij where fi, fj are elements of KT,Q(pt) and
pij belongs to the augmentation ideal I.

The analogous notion of a commensurable equivariant Chow-theory is straightforward.
The following proposition is the main result of this section.

Proposition 5.11. If the equivariant K-theory of X is commensurable then the equivariant
Chow-ring of X is commensurable. Furthermore given a presentation of equivariant K-
theory in terms of congruence conditions one can deduce a presentation of the equivariant
Chow-rings.
Proof. Let us assume that the equivariant K-theory of X is commensurable and it is deﬁned
by ﬁnitely many congruence conditions of the form fi = fj mod pij (where pij belongs to
the augmentation ideal I) with a ﬁnite index set (i, j) ∈ S.

In the commutative diagram (19) the left-most and the right-most horizontal squares are
commutative since completion is functorial. The arrows labeled i (resp. j) are injective by

assumption. Let us assume for now that the arrows(cid:98)i (resp. (cid:98)j) are also injections (this is

proved in Lemma 5.12 below). The vertical maps are given by the equivariant Riemann-Roch
morphism which is functorial.

Moreover the polynomials pi,j belong to the augmentation ideal I, so they are polynomials
(without constant terms) in the variables 1− χ, therefore τ T (pij) belongs to the augmentation
ideal J by the formula (18) above. Taking colimits, we ﬁnd an explicit system of ﬁnitely many
congruence equations deﬁning A∗

T,Q(X) is commensurable.

Finally Lemma 5.12 below completes the proof.
Lemma 5.12. The I-adic ﬁltration on KT,Q(X) and the ﬁltration induced on KT,Q(X) as a
submodule of KT,Q(X T ) with its I-adic ﬁltration are equivalent. The canonical completion
maps KT,Q(X) → (cid:92)KT,Q(X) are injective. The same assertions hold for the completions of
equivariant Chow-groups appearing in diagram (19) above.
Proof. The KT,Q(pt) module KT,Q(X T ) is ﬁnitely generated and KT,Q(pt) is a noetherian ring.
As a result, the assertion is a consequence of the Artin-Rees lemma and the second assertion
is a consequence of the Krull Intersection theorem [28, Chapter 8]. The proof for equivariant
(cid:3)
Chow-groups is identical.

When X is a G-variety then the Weyl group W of G acts on T -equivariant K-theory as
well the equivariant Chow-groups and the equivariant Riemann-Roch map from (cid:92)KT,Q(X T ) →

Appendix A. Some remarks on Steinberg Basis

Let G be a semisimple, simply connected algebraic group T a maximal torus of G with char-
acter lattice M. Let W be the Weyl group of G (identiﬁed with NG(T )/T ) and {α1, . . . , αn}
denote the simple roots. The corresponding coroots are denoted by α∨
i and the fundamental
weights (dual to α∨
Then for any reﬂection subgroup W (cid:48) of W , Steinberg constructs an explicit basis of Z[M ]W (cid:48)

S :(cid:8)ev = v−1(λv)(cid:9)

Steinberg’s construction specializes to the basis
(21)
where λv is the product (in Z[M ]) of the fundamental weights λi such that v−1(αi) < 0.

v∈W

The work of Griﬀeth and Ram in [22, Section 5] on the positivity of Schubert basis motivates

x ∈ Z[M ] is called positive with respect to B if x =(cid:80)

the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition A.1. (i). Let B = {ev}v∈W be any basis of Z[M ] over Z[M ]W . An element
v∈B fv · ev where the invariant Laurent

polynomials fv satisfy the property

(−l)((cid:96)(v))fv ∈ Z+[M ]

(i.e. (−l)((cid:96)(v))fv is a positive integral combination of monomials) where ((cid:96)(v)) ∈ {±1} is a
function that depends only on the Coxeter length of v.

(ii). A basis B is called positive if for any ev, ev(cid:48) ∈ B the elements ev · ev(cid:48) are positive.
The main result of this appendix is the following proposition.

Proposition A.2. The Steinberg basis S is not positive.
Proof. The proof of the proposition follows from explicit computations. These computations
were performed using the software SageMath [36]. The Steinberg basis for root system of
type A and rank 2 is presented in Table 2. Let us consider two elements of Z[M ]W deﬁned by
