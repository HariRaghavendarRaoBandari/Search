ON TRIPLE ZETA VALUES OF EVEN WEIGHT

AND THEIR CONNECTIONS WITH PERIOD

POLYNOMIALS

DING MA, KOJI TASAKA

Abstract. We study triple zeta values of even weight and show

various connections with period polynomials. As a result, an (ex-

pected) upper bound of the dimension of the vector space spanned

by certain triple zeta values is obtained.

1. Introduction

In 1994, Zagier [21, p.508] (see also [22, Section 3]) found a remark-
able connection between double zeta values and cusp forms for SL2(Z),
which he described as “starting at weight k = 12 there are relations over
Q among the numbers ζ(a, k − a) (a odd, 1 ≤ a ≤ k − 2) and the num-

ber of such relations is equal to the number of linearly independent cusp

forms of weight k” (for the correct assertion we have changed the range

of a in the original sentence). Then, in 2006, Gangl, Kaneko and Zagier

[10] studied this phenomena in detail and proved that for each even in-
teger k ≥ 12 the numbers ζ(a, k − a) (a odd, 3 ≤ a ≤ k − 2) satisfy

dim Sk relations, modulo Qζ(k), over Q, where Sk is the space of cusp
forms of weight k for SL2(Z). In this paper, as one of next-expected gen-
eralisations, we examine Q-linear relations among ζ(even, odd, odd)’s,

among ζ(odd, even, odd)’s and among ζ(odd, odd, even)’s modulo lower

depths, and relate them with cusp forms, or rather, period polynomi-

als. A similar study for ζ(odd, odd, odd) has been done by the second

author (see [18]). Our study will give a common generalisation of the

study of linear relations among ζ(odd, even)’s and among ζ(even, odd)’s

established by Zagier [23] as well, which was studied by the ﬁrst author

[8, 9] in more detail.

Let us present our main results ﬁrst. Instead of studying real multiple

zeta values (see (2.1)), we will mainly treat the motivic multiple zeta

value

ζ m(n1, . . . , nr),

since our study starts with the Galois theoretical argument developed

by Brown. We will employee the motivic multiple zeta value deﬁned in
[4, Deﬁnition 2.1], in which ζ m(2) is not treated as zero. Let us denote
by

ζ m
D(n1, . . . , nr)

the depth-graded motivic multiple zeta value, which is the motivic
multiple zeta value ζ m(n1, . . . , nr) modulo lower depths. In this paper,
we introduce j-th almost totally odd motivic multiple zeta values which
are depth-graded motivic multiple zeta values ζ m
D(n1, . . . , nr) at the
sequence consisting of an even integer nj ≥ 2 at the j-th index and odd
integers ni ≥ 3 for i 6= j (Deﬁnition 4.1). In particular, we only consider
j-th almost totally odd motivic triple zeta values for j ∈ {1, 2, 3} in

this paper: let

T (j)

N

denote the Q-vector space spanned by all j-th almost totally odd mo-
tivic triple zeta values of weight N. For instance, the space T (2)
10
D(3, 2, 5), and the space T (3)
spanned by ζ m
is
spanned by ζ m
N is deﬁned to be the triv-
ial space when there is no j-th almost totally odd motivic triple zeta

D(5, 2, 3), ζ m
D(3, 3, 2) over Q. The space T (j)

D(3, 4, 3) and ζ m

is

value of weight N.

The main results are as follows. Set

E(x) =

x2
1 − x2 = x2 + x4 + · · · , O(x) =

x3
1 − x2 = x3 + x5 + · · ·

and

S(x) =Xk>0

dimC Skxk =

x12

(1 − x4)(1 − x6)

= x12 + x16 + · · · .

The notation P aN xN ≤P bN xN means aN ≤ bN for all N.

Theorem 1.1. For j ∈ {1, 2}, we have

XN >0

dimQ T (j)

N xN ≤ E(x)O(x)2 − E(x)S(x).

Theorem 1.2. We have

XN >0

dimQ T (3)

N xN ≤ E(x)O(x)2 −

1
x2

E(x)S(x) − (

1
x

+ x)O(x)S(x).

Roughly speaking, these theorems say that there are Q-linear re-

lations among almost totally odd triple zeta values corresponding to
cusp forms since the coeﬃcient of xN in the power series expansion of
E(x)O(x)2 at x = 0 coincides with the number of generators of each
space T (j)
N (j = 1, 2, 3). It is expected that the opposite inequalities in
the above theorems hold for j = 2, 3 (see Remarks 5.5 and 6.8 for more

details).

For the proofs of Theorems 1.1 and 1.2, we will use a method de-
veloped by Brown [4]. Let H denote the Q-vector space spanned by

all motivic multiple zeta values. It was shown by Brown that there is
a non-canonical isomorphism φ : H → U as algebra comodules, where
U = U ′ ⊗ Q[f2] and U ′ = Qhf2i+1 | i ≥ 1i are deﬁned in Section 2.4.
Our ﬁrst goal (Section 3) is to compute the image of ζ m(n1, n2, n3)
under the non-canonical isomophism φ. We will give an explicit for-
mula of φ(ζ m(n1, n2, n3)) in terms of words consisting of fn’s, modulo
Qfn1+n2+n3 (Proposition 3.7). Since this expression uses a linear ba-
sis of U, the problem ﬁnding Q-linear relations among motivic triple

zeta values can be reduced to a simple linear algebra problem. Using

the coeﬃcients obtained from this expression, we deﬁne certain square
matrices C (j)
N for each j ∈ {1, 2, 3} (Deﬁnition 4.2). We will see that
all Q-linear relations among j-th almost totally odd motivic triple zeta
values arise from right annihilators of the matrix C (j)
N (Theorem 4.3),
and hence that the rank of the matrix C (j)
N equals the dimension of
the space T (j)
N (Corollary 4.4). Thus, we shall examine the rank of the
matrix C (j)
N .

Our idea to prove upper bounds of the rank of C (j)

N is to look at
left annihilators of the matrix C (j)
N since somehow they are related
to the coeﬃcients of restricted even period polynomials and odd period

4

polynomials. Here the restricted even period polynomial (resp. the odd
period polynomial) of degree N − 2 is deﬁned as an even (resp. odd),
homogeneous polynomial p(x1, x2) ∈ Q[x1, x2](N −2) of degree N − 2
such that p(x1, 0) = 0 and

(1.1)

p(x1, x2) − p(x2 − x1, x2) + p(x2 − x1, x1) = 0

(resp. p(x1, x2)−p(x1 + x2, x2)−p(x1 + x2, x1) = 0). An important fact
about these polynomials is that the dimension of the Q-vector space of

restricted even period polynomials (resp. odd period polynomials) of
degree N − 2, denoted by Wev
N ), equals the dimension of
the space of cusp forms of weight N for SL2(Z):

N (resp. Wod

(1.2)

N xN = S(x),

which is known as Eichler–Shimura–Manin correspondence (see [15,
Section 1.1] and see also [2, Section 1.1] for the space Wev
N ). With these
conventions, we will show that there are injections from the space of

restricted even period polynomials to the left annihilators of the ma-
trix C (j)
N for j = 1, 2 (see Section 5.2: a conjectural connection with the
derivative of restricted odd period polynomial will be described in Re-

mark 5.5) and from the space of odd period polynomials, the derivative

of restricted even period polynomials and restricted even period poly-
nomials to the left annihilators of the matrix C (3)
N (see Sections 6.2 and
6.3). These results give a lower bound of the space of left annihilators
of C (j)

N , and hence Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 are obtained.

Our study has an remarkable application. According to the parity

result (see [12, Corollary 8] and [19]), each depth-graded motivic triple
zeta value ζ m
D(n1, n2, n3) of even weight N can be expressed as Q-linear
combinations of ζ m
D(k3)’s with k1 + k2 + k3 = N and k3 even.
As far as we know, there are a few results (see [16, Theorem 5.2] and [17,

D(k1, k2)ζ m

Eq. (1.11)]) for the explicit expressions of the parity result. For this,

as a consequence of our results, we show a newly explicit expression of

the j-th almost totally odd motivic triple zeta value of even weight as
Q-linear combinations of ζ m

D(k3)’s (Theorem 5.6).

It is worth pointing out that the cases depth ≥ 4 are not treated in
this paper, since we can not compute φ(ζ m(n1, n2, n3, n4)) canonically.
To compute them, we may need to choose algebra generators in depth

4 corresponding to cusp forms, but these involves solving a few open

problems (see [5, 7]), which we do not treat in this paper.

The contents of this paper are as follows.

In Section 2, we recall

the theory of motivic multiple zeta values.
In Section 3, an explicit
formula of φ(ζ m(n1, n2, n3)) is given. Section 4 studies the matrix C (j)
N .
We will prove that the rank of these matrices equals the dimension of
the space T (j)
N . In Section 5, we give a proof of Theorem 1.1 (Section
5.2). This needs a certain lemma, which is treated in Section 5.1. As

a consequence of this lemma, one can give an explicit formula for j-

th almost totally odd motivic triple zeta values, which we discuss in

Section 5.3. Section 6 is devoted to proving Theorem 1.2.

2. Preliminaries

2.1. Motivic multiple zeta values. The deﬁnition of the motivic
multiple zeta value ζ m(n1, . . . , nr) we use is referred to [4, Deﬁnition
2.1]. We remark that ζ m(2) is not treated to be zero. A more elaborate
deﬁnition can be found in [6, Section 2.2] where the motivic multiple

zeta value is deﬁned as a motivic period of the Tannakian category of

the mixed Tate motives over Z.

Let H be the Q-vector space spanned by all motivic multiple zeta
values. As usual, we call n1 + · · · + nr the weight and r the depth for
ζ m(n1, . . . , nr). The space H has the structure of a graded Q-algebra:

H =MN ≥0

HN ,

where HN denotes the Q-vector space spanned by all motivic multiple
zeta values of weight N. We regard 1 ∈ Q as the unique motivic

multiple zeta value of weight 0 and depth 0 and the product is naturally

given by the shuﬄe product of iterated integrals (see (2.3) below).
There is the period map from the space H to R sending the motivic

6

D. MA, K. TASAKA

multiple zeta value ζ m(n1, . . . , nr) to the real number ζ(n1, . . . , nr), or
rather, the regularised multiple zeta value with respect to the shuﬄe

product (see [12, Section 2], and also [1, Deﬁnition 3.1] for our setting).

Here the multiple zeta value is deﬁned by

(2.1)

ζ(n1, . . . , nr) = X0<k1<···<kr

1

kn1
1 · · · knr
r

,

for integers n1, . . . , nr−1 ≥ 1 and nr ≥ 2.

2.2. Motivic iterated integrals. To compute the coaction on the
space H, we recall the motivic iterated integrals.

For ai ∈ {0, 1} we denote by

(2.2)

I m(a0; a1, . . . , aN ; aN +1) ∈ HN

the motivic iterated integral (see [4, (2.16)]), which is deﬁned by ex-

tending Goncharov’s motivic iterated integrals [11]. With this, the

motivic multiple zeta value is given in the following manner:

ζ m(n1, . . . , nr) = I m(0; 1, 0, . . . , 0

, . . . , 1, 0, . . . , 0

; 1).

| {z }

n1−1

| {z }

nr−1

For latter reference, we recall fundamental properties satisﬁed by

motivic iterated integrals (see [4, p.955]):

• The unit is given by I m(a; b) for a, b ∈ {0, 1}.
• The product is given by the shuﬄe product:

for all integers

N, N ′ ≥ 0 and ai ∈ {0, 1}, one has

I m(a0; a1, . . . , aN ; aN +N ′+1)I m(a0; aN +1, . . . , aN +N ′; aN +N ′+1)

I m(a0; aσ−1(1), . . . , aσ−1(N +N ′); aN +N ′+1),

(2.3)

= Xσ∈Σ(N,N ′)

where Σ(N, N ′) is the set of σ in the symmetric group SN +N ′
such that σ(1) < · · · < σ(N) and σ(N + 1) < · · · < σ(N + N ′).

• For N ≥ 1 and ai, a ∈ {0, 1}, we have

(2.4)

I m(a; a1, . . . , aN ; a) = 0.

• For any ai ∈ {0, 1}, we have

(2.5)

I m(a0; a1, . . . , aN ; aN +1) = (−1)N I m(aN +1; aN , . . . , a1; a0).

We remark that the last identity (2.5) essentially follows from (2.3)

and the path composition formula [11, (iii) p.224] satisﬁed by iterated

integrals.

We further remark that for any a, b, c ∈ {0, 1}, since I m(a; b; c) ∈

H1 = {0}, it can be seen from (2.3) that

I m(a; b; c)n = I m(a; b, . . . , b

(n ≥ 1).

2.3. Coaction on the space H. We recall the coaction ∆ on the
space H.

Let us denote by A the quotient algebra H/ζ m(2)H and by I a the
image of an motivic iterated integral I m in the space A. Then the space
H forms a graded A-comodule over Q (see [4, Theorem 2.4]) with the

coaction

∆ : H −→ A ⊗ H.

This coaction ∆ can be computed for the element (2.2) by the formula

(2.7)

(cid:26) kYp=0
X0≤k≤N Xi0<i1<···<ik<ik+1
⊗ I m(a0, ai1, . . . , aik; aN +1)(cid:27),

i0=0,ik+1=N +1

I a(aip; aip+1, . . . , aip+1−1; aip+1)

which can be found in [4, Eq.

(2.18)]. It is originally given by Gon-

charov (see [11, Eq. (27)]) with the factors interchanged. We note that
the quotient space A carries a Hopf algebra structure with the product
given by the shuﬄe product and the coproduct ∆ : A → A⊗A induced
by the coaction ∆ on H.

2.4. Algebra comodule structure of the space H. The A-comodule
H is isomorphic to a certain universal comodule U. We will now
describe the comodule U and a certain non-canonical isomorphism
φ : H → U.

Let U ′ be the noncommutative polynomial algebra freely generated

by symbols f2i+1 in weight 2i + 1:

U ′ = Qhf2i+1 | i ≥ 1i.

8

D. MA, K. TASAKA

The vector space U ′ is equipped with the product given by the shuﬄe
product x

fi1 · · · fir

x fir+1 · · · fir+s = Xσ∈Σ(r,s)

fiσ−1(1)

· · · fiσ−1(r+s)

and the coproduct given by the deconcatenation ∆•

(2.8)

∆•(fi1 · · · fir ) =

rXj=0

fi1 · · · fij ⊗ fij+1 · · · fir .

With this, the space U ′ is a Hopf algebra, where the antipode S (see
[13, Proposition V.2.4.]) is given by the formula

S(fi1 · · · fir ) = (−1)rfir · · · fi1.

which we do not use in this paper. We note that the Hopf algebra U ′ is
isomorphic to the ring of regular functions on the unipotent radical of

the motivic Galois group of the Tannakian category of the mixed Tate

motives over Z.

Let us consider the graded vector space

U := U ′ ⊗ Q[f2] =MN ≥0

UN ,

where f2 is a commutative symbol of weight 2 and the graded part
of weight N of U is denoted by UN . The space U carries a graded
U ′-comodule structure, with the coaction ∆• : U → U ′ ⊗ U satisfying
2 ) = ∆•(w)∆•(f2)k for any k > 0 and
∆•(f2) = 1 ⊗ f2 and ∆•(wf k
w ∈ U ′.

It was shown by Goncharov that there is a non-canonical embedding
: A → U ′ as Hopf algebras. Since we have H ∼= A ⊗ Q[ζ m(2)]
φ′
and ∆(ζ m(2)) = 1 ⊗ ζ m(2), the embedding φ′ can be extended to the
algebra comodule homomorphism φ : H → U, i.e. ∆• ◦ φ = (φ′ ⊗ φ) ◦ ∆
holds. By [4, Lemma 3.2], we can normalise the choice of embedding
φ : H → U as φ(ζ m(N)) = fN for N ≥ 2, where we put

f2k :=

ζ m(2k)
ζ m(2)k f k

2 (k ≥ 1).

Since the Hoﬀman basis conjecture is true for motivic multiple zeta

values [4, Theorem 1.1], we have the following theorem.

TRIPLE ZETA VALUES AND PERIOD POLYNOMIALS

9

Theorem 2.1. There is a non-canonical isomorphism

φ : H −→ U

as algebra comodules, sending ζ m(N) to fN for N ≥ 2.

Computing the image of the motivic multiple zeta value under the

isomorphism φ plays a crucial role in this paper. In the next section, we
shall compute φ(ζ m(n1, n2)) and φ(ζ m(n1, n2, n3)) by using the Brown
operator.

3. A computation of the isomorphism φ

3.1. The Brown operator Dm. Let us recall an inﬁnitesimal version
of the coaction ∆ introduced by Brown [4, Deﬁnition 3.1].

Let L := A>0/(A>0)2 be the tangent space of A, which is a Lie
coalgebra, and πm : A>0 → Lm the natural projection taking the

graded part of weight m of the graded vector space L =Lm>0 Lm.

Deﬁnition 3.1 (The Brown operator). We deﬁne the linear map Dm
for all odd integer m > 1 by the following composition map:

Dm : H ∆−1⊗id−→ A>0 ⊗ H πm⊗id−→ Lm ⊗ H.

One can easily check that the map Dm is a derivation (i.e. Dm(ξ1ξ2) =
(1 ⊗ ξ1)Dm(ξ2) + (1 ⊗ ξ2)Dm(ξ1) for any ξ1, ξ2 ∈ H). From (2.7), we
ﬁnd that the formula of the map Dm for the element (2.2) is given by

(3.1)

N −mXp=0

πm(I a(ap; ap+1, . . . , ap+m; ap+m+1))

⊗ I m(a0; a1, . . . , ap, ap+m+1, . . . , aN ; aN +1).

As in [4, p.959], in the formula (3.1), we call the sequence of consecutive
elements (ap; ap+1, . . . , ap+m; ap+m+1) on the left a subsequence of length
m of the original sequence and (a0; a1, . . . , ap, ap+m+1, . . . , aN ; aN +1) a
quotient sequence. For the subsequence (ap; ap+1, . . . , ap+m; ap+m+1), we
call the number of 1’s in {ap+1, . . . , ap+m} the depth.

3.2. A computation of the Brown operator Dm. In this subsec-
tion, we compute the Brown operator for motivic multiple zeta values.

the Q-vector space spanned by all motivic multiple zeta values of depth

formula Dm(ζ m(n1, . . . , nr)).

Proposition 3.3. For any integers n1, . . . , nr ≥ 1 with N = n1 + · · · +

For r = 2 and 3, Proposition 3.3 can be stated as follows.

Corollary 3.4. (i) For integers N, n1, n2 ≥ 1 with N = n1 + n2 and
an odd integer m with N > m > 1, we have

Dm(ζ m(n1, n2)) = e(cid:0)m,N −m

7] and also Remark 3.8), we have

eﬃcient am(n1, n2, n3) ∈ Q, we do not use it below.

Proof. We recall the inﬁnitesimal version of the coaction ∆• deﬁned in
(2.8) on U (see [4, Eq.

We remark that by above method we can not determine explicit
coeﬃcients of lower terms, such as fN . However, using the explicit
rational associator constructed by Brown [7, Section 7], one may be
able to give a closed formula for φ(ζ m(n1, n2, n3)), which we do not
need in this paper.

Remark 3.8. As a corollary of Proposition 3.7 (i), for N ≥ 5 odd and
positive integers n1, n2 ≥ 1 with N = n1 + n2, one immediately obtains

ζ m(n1, n2) ≡ Xm1+m2=N

This was proved by Zagier [21, Proposition 7] with an explicit coeﬃcient
of ζ m(N) provided. Similarly, we will give an explicit formula of the
parity result for certain motivic triple zeta values of even weight in

Section 4.3.

4. Linear relations among almost totally odd motivic

triple zeta values

4.1. Almost totally odd motivic multiple zeta values. We re-

call the depth-graded motivic multiple zeta values and introduce j-th

almost totally odd motivic multiple zeta values.

Denote by D the depth ﬁltration (see [5, Section 4]), which is an

increasing ﬁltration on H:

D0H = Q ⊂ D1H ⊂ · · · ⊂ DrH ⊂ · · · ⊂ H.

We note that the space H has the structure of a ﬁltered algebra with

respect to the depth ﬁltration D, i.e.

DrH · DsH ⊂ Dr+sH

holds for any r, s ≥ 0.

16

D. MA, K. TASAKA

Consider the following graded algebra:

We denote by

grDH :=Mr≥1

DrH(cid:14)Dr−1H.

ζ m
D(n1, . . . , nr)

an image of ζ m(n1, . . . , nr) in the bigraded Q-algebra grDH, called the
depth-graded motivic multiple zeta value. Note that by deﬁnition ζ m
D(2)
is non-zero.

Deﬁnition 4.1. For an integer r ≥ j ≥ 1, the depth-graded motivic
multiple zeta value ζ m
D(n1, . . . , nr) is called a j-th almost totally odd
motivic multiple zeta value if nj ≥ 2 is even and other ni’s are odd and
greater than 1.

We remark that the totally odd motivic multiple zeta values, which
are elements in grDA of the form ζ m
D(2n1 + 1, . . . , 2nr + 1), were origi-
nally introduced by Brown [5, Section 10] in recasting the Broadhurst-

Kreimer conjecture [3] as a statement of the homology of the depth-

graded motivic Lie algebra (see [5, Conjecture 4]). It is believed that

the Q-algebra generated by totally odd motivic multiple zeta values is

isomorphic to the graded dual of the universal enveloping algebra of
the Lie subalgebra godd of the depth-graded motivic Lie algebra gen-
erated by canonical generators in depth 1, and the generating series of

the dimension of the Q-vector space spanned by totally odd multiple

zeta values of weight N and depth r is therefore given by

1

1 − O(x)y + S(x)y2 .

Our almost totally odd motivic multiple zeta value is a parity-analogue

of totally odd one, so it is natural to expect that the generating series of

the Q-vector space spanned by almost totally odd multiple zeta values

of weight N and depth r is given by

E(x)y

1 − O(x)y + S(x)y2 ,

where the depth 1 space is deﬁned to be the Q-vector space spanned
by ζ m
D(2m)’s (m > 0). After this, this expectation will not be discussed

in any detail. We will restrict our attention to the j-th almost totally

odd motivic triple zeta value.

For j ∈ {1, 2, 3}, let

I(j)
N = {(n1, n2, n3) ∈ Z3

≥2 | N = n1+n2+n3, nj : even, ni : odd (i 6= j)}

be the set of j-th almost totally odd indices of weight N and depth 3.
Let us denote by T (j)
N the Q-vector space spanned by all j-th almost
totally odd motivic triple zeta values of weight N:

T (j)
N := hζ m

D(n1, n2, n3) | (n1, n2, n3) ∈ I(j)

The space T (j)

N is deﬁned to be the trivial space whenever I(j)

N = ∅.

4.2. Matrices C (j)
N mentioned in the in-
troduction and clarify the meaning of the right (resp. left) annihilator

N . We deﬁne the matrices C (j)

of them.

Let dN be the cardinality of the set I(j)

N . Note that

XN >0

dN xN = E(x)O(x)2.

We now deﬁne dN × dN matrices C (j)

N for j ∈ {1, 2, 3} as follows.

Deﬁnition 4.2. For each integer N > 0 and j ∈ {1, 2, 3}, the dN × dN
matrix C (j)

N is deﬁned by

n1,n2,n3 (cid:1)(cid:17)(m1,m2,m3)∈I

N =(cid:16)c(cid:0)m1,m2,m3
N , respectively, where the integers c(cid:0)m1,m2,m3

whose rows and columns are indexed by (m1, m2, m3) and (n1, n2, n3)
in the sets I(3)
deﬁned in Deﬁnition 3.6.

of the matrix C (j)

For j ∈ {1, 2, 3}, we denote by Vect(j)

We prove that ξ ∈ D2HN . Note that by Proposition 3.7 (ii) we have
φ(ξ) ∈ UN,2. The element ξ has an expression of ξ in terms of double
zeta values and single zeta values because of the parity result (see

[12, Corollary 8]). More precisely, since for each even integer N > 0
the space D3HN is generated by the elements ζ m(n1, n2)ζ m(n3) with
(n1, n2, n3) ∈ I(3)
N and D2HN , the element ξ can be expressed as a
Q-linear combination of the form

ξ = X(n1,n2,n3)∈I

(3)
N

bn1,n2,n3ζ m(n1, n2)ζ m(n3) + γ

with some bn1,n2,n3 ∈ Q and γ ∈ D2HN . Applying φ to the form (4.2),
one obtains

n1,n2≥3
n1,n2:odd

bn1,n2,n3ζ m(n1, n2)(cid:19)φ(ζ m(n3)) + φ(γ).

From Proposition 3.7 (i), the ﬁrst term in the right-hand side of the
above equation is a Q-linear combination of foddfoddfeven’s and fN .
Since φ(ξ) ∈ UN,2, we have

φ(cid:18) Xn1+n2=N −n3

n1,n2≥3
n1,n2:odd

bn1,n2,n3ζ m(n1, n2)(cid:19) ∈ QfN −n3,

and hence φ(ξ − γ) ∈ QfN . Thus, one has ξ ∈ D2HN .

We are now going to prove that if we have

ξ = X(n1,n2,n3)∈I

(j)
N

an1,n2,n3ζ m(n1, n2, n3) ∈ D2HN ,

then the coeﬃcient vector (an1,n2,n3)(n1,n2,n3)∈I
we have Dm(ζ m(N)) = πm(ζ m(N))⊗1, for any γ ∈ D2HN and (m1, m2, m3) ∈
I(3)
N it follows that

N . Since

(j)
N

lies in ker tC (j)

(cid:0)id ⊗ Dm2(cid:1) ◦ Dm1(γ) = 0.

By Deﬁnition 3.6 and Corollary 3.4, for (m1, m2, m3) ∈ I(3)
I(j)
N , one has

N and (n1, n2, n3) ∈

n1,n2,n3 (cid:1)ξm1 ⊗ ξm2 ⊗ ζ m(m3).
(cid:0)id ⊗ Dm2(cid:1) ◦ Dm1(cid:0)ζ m(n1, n2, n3)(cid:1) = c(cid:0)m1,m2,m3
Then, the statement follows from (cid:0)id ⊗ Dm2(cid:1) ◦ Dm1(ξ) = 0, which

completes the proof.

For a Laurent polynomial f (x1, x2, x3) ∈ Q[x±1

1 , x±1

3 ], consider

the following change of variables:

(5.1)

f (x1, x2, x3)(cid:12)(cid:12)σ1 = f (x2 − x1, x1, x3) − f (x2 − x1, x2, x3),
f (x1, x2, x3)(cid:12)(cid:12)σ2 = f (x3 − x2, x1, x2) − f (x3 − x2, x1, x3),
f (x1, x2, x3)(cid:12)(cid:12)σ3 = f (x1, x2 − x3, x2) − f (x1, x2 − x3, x3),
f (x1, x2, x3)(cid:12)(cid:12)σ4 = f (x2 − x1, x3 − x1, x1) − f (x1 − x2, x3 − x2, x2),
f (x1, x2, x3)(cid:12)(cid:12)σ5 = f (x3 − x2, x3 − x1, x3) − f (x2 − x3, x2 − x1, x2).

Lemma 5.1. For any Laurent polynomial f (x1, x2, x3) ∈ Q[x±1
satisfying f (±x1, ±x2, x3) = f (x1, x2, x3), we have

(5.2) (f(cid:12)(cid:12)(1 + σ3))(cid:12)(cid:12)(1 + σ1 + σ2) = (f(cid:12)(cid:12)(1 + σ1))(cid:12)(cid:12)(1 + σ2 + σ3 + σ4 + σ5),
where f(cid:12)(cid:12)(1 + σ∗) means f + f(cid:12)(cid:12)σ∗.

Proof. This can be veriﬁed by a straightforward calculation. For in-

stance, we obtain

f (x1, x2, x3)(cid:12)(cid:12)σ1(cid:12)(cid:12)σ2 = f (x1 − x3 + x2, x3 − x2, x2) − f (x1 − x3 + x2, x1, x2)

− f (x1 − x3 + x2, x3 − x2, x3) + f (x1 − x3 + x2, x1, x3).

The identity (5.2) is then obtained by using the assumption f (±x1, ±x2, x3) =
f (x1, x2, x3).

Thus, by Lemma 5.1 we complete the proof.

5.2. Proof of Theorem 1.1. In this subsection, we give a proof of

Theorem 1.1.

For N > 0 even, we deﬁne

CN =(cid:16)e(cid:0)m1,m2

n1,n2(cid:1)(cid:17)(m1,m2)∈IN (oo)

(n1,n2)∈IN (aa)

,

whose rows and columns are indexed by (m1, m2) and (n1, n2) in the
sets IN (oo) and IN (aa), respectively (for the set IN (∗∗), see (5.4)). For
this matrix CN , we have the following theorem.

Theorem 5.3. The following map

is an isomorphism as vector spaces.

Proof. This is essentially the same as [2, Proposition 3.2] (see also [18,

Proposition 3.4]). For completeness, we give a proof.

Suppose that p(x1, x2) = P(n1,n2)∈IN (oo) an1,n2xn1−1

Then, by (1.1) we have

Thus, the map is well-deﬁned, and its injectivity is obvious.

The statement that (an1,n2)(n1,n2)∈IN (oo) lies in ker CN is equivalent

to the statement that

(n1,n2)∈IN (ee)

was treated in [14, Section 3.2], where they proved that there is a
bijection from the space of restricted even period polynomials of Γ0(2)
to the left annihilators of the above matrix.

We are now in a position to prove Theorem 1.1.

TRIPLE ZETA VALUES AND PERIOD POLYNOMIALS

27

Proof of Theorem 1.1. By Corollary 5.2, the matrix C (j)
follows:

N is written as

C (j)

N =(cid:16)e(cid:0)m1,m2

n1,n2(cid:1)δ(cid:0)m3

n3(cid:1)(cid:17) (m1,m2,m3)∈I

(n1,n2,n3)∈IN (aae)

·(cid:16)h(cid:0)m1,m2,m3

N

Note that the left factor is a block matrix with blocks CN −k for k =
2, 4, . . . , N − 6:

n1,n2(cid:1)δ(cid:0)m3

(n1,n2,n3)∈IN (aae)

(3)
N

= diag(CN −2, CN −4, . . . , C6).

By linear algebra, the inequality

dimQ ker C (j)

N ≥ dimQ ker diag(CN −2, CN −4, . . . , C6)

holds. As a corollary of Theorem 5.3, for N > 0 even, we have

dimQ ker CN = dimQ Wev
N ,

and hence by (1.2)

XN >0

dimQ ker C (j)

N xN ≥ E(x)XN >0
= E(x)XN >0

dimQ ker CN xN

dimQ Wev

N xN = E(x)S(x).

Then Theorem 1.1 follows from Corollary 4.4 and (4.1).

(cid:3)

Remark 5.5. The above proof works for any j = 1, 2, 3, but these do

not give enough bounds when j = 1 and j = 3 (the case j = 3 is treated

in the next section). Numerically, we have the following conjectures:

dimQ ker C (1)

N xN ?=

1
x2

E(x)S(x),

dimQ ker C (2)

N xN ?= E(x)S(x),

XN >0
XN >0

or equivalently,

dimQ T (1)

N xN ?= E(x)O(x)2 −

1
x2

E(x)S(x),

dimQ T (2)

N xN ?= E(x)O(x)2 − E(x)S(x).

XN >0
XN >0

28

These were checked by Mathematica up to N = 30. From this, we ﬁnd
that there have to be more elements in ker C (1)
N corresponding to the
xN -term in

E(x)S(x) − E(x)S(x) = S(x),

which is nothing but the cusp forms of weight N. For this, we ob-

served a remarkable connection with the derivative of odd period poly-

nomials removing the ﬁrst and last terms (which should be called

the restricted odd period polynomial). For example, the row vector
(35, −42, 15, 0, 0, 0) is a basis of ker C (1)
12 , and these coeﬃcients are
obtained from the derivative of the odd period polynomial 4x9

5.3. The parity result for depth 3. As we mentioned in Remark

3.8, this subsection gives an explicit formula for the parity result for
motivic triple zeta values ζ m(n1, n2, n3) with (n1, n2, n3) ∈ I(j)
N . This is
a consequence of Corollary 5.2 and Proposition 3.7.

Theorem 5.6. Let N > 0 be an even integer. For each (n1, n2, n3) ∈
I(j)
N , we have

ζ m

D(n1, n2, n3) = X(k1,k2,k3)∈IN (aae)

ζ m(n1, n2, n3) − X(k1,k2,k3)∈IN (aae)

n1,n2,n3(cid:1)ζ m(k1, k2)ζ m(k3) ∈ D2HN .
h(cid:0) k1,k2,k3

TRIPLE ZETA VALUES AND PERIOD POLYNOMIALS

29

By the parity result, we know that there exist some rational numbers
and γ ∈ D2HN such that

(5.5)

ζ m(n1, n2, n3) = X(k1,k2,k3)∈IN (aae)

n1,n2,n3(cid:1)ζ m(k1, k2)ζ m(k3) + γ.
a(cid:0) k1,k2,k3

By Corollary 5.2 and Proposition 3.7, we have

φ(cid:0)ζ m(n1, n2, n3)− X(k1,k2,k3)∈IN (aae)

n1,n2,n3(cid:1)ζ m(k1, k2)ζ m(k3)−γ(cid:1) ∈ UN,2.
h(cid:0) k1,k2,k3

By (5.5), the left-hand side of the above is reduced to

(5.6)

φ(cid:0) X(k1,k2,k3)∈IN (aae)(cid:0)a(cid:0) k1,k2,k3

n1,n2,n3(cid:1) − h(cid:0) k1,k2,k3

n1,n2,n3(cid:1)(cid:1)ζ m(k1, k2)ζ m(k3)(cid:1).

Since by Proposition 3.7 (i), for (n1, n2, n3) ∈ IN (aae) we have

φ(ζ m(n1, n2)ζ m(n3)) ∈ hfm1fm2fm3 | (m1, m2, m3) ∈ I(3)

N iQ ⊕ QfN ,

it turns out that the element (5.6) lies in QfN , and hence

φ(cid:0)ζ m(n1, n2, n3)− X(k1,k2,k3)∈IN (aae)

n1,n2,n3(cid:1)ζ m(k1, k2)ζ m(k3)−γ(cid:1) ∈ QfN .
h(cid:0) k1,k2,k3

This completes the proof.

6. The parity (odd,odd,even)

6.1. Proof of Theorem 1.2. In this subsection, we give a proof of
Theorem 1.2. For this, we ﬁrst give an expression of the matrix C (3)
N
as a product of two square matrices, and then prove a lower bound of

the dimension of the space of left annihilators of each matrices.

N = ker FN ⊕(cid:0)Im FN ∩ ker EN(cid:1).

Thus, once we give a lower bound of the dimension of each of the above
spaces on the left, a lower bound of dimQ ker C (3)

N is obtained from

(6.1)

dimQ ker C (3)

N = dimQ ker FN + dimQ(cid:0)Im FN ∩ ker EN(cid:1).

For this, we shall prove the following inequalities:

Proposition 6.1. We have

XN >0

dimQ ker FN xN ≥(cid:0)x +

1

x(cid:1)O(x)S(x).

Proposition 6.2. We have

XN >0

dimQ(cid:0)Im FN ∩ ker EN(cid:1)xN ≥

1
x2

E(x)S(x).

The proofs of Propositions 6.1 and 6.2 are postponed until next sub-

sections.

Proof of Theorem 1.2. Combining (6.1) with Propositions 6.1 and 6.2,

we have

XN >0

dimQ ker C (3)

N xN ≥

1

E(x)S(x) + (

Thus, by Corollary 4.4 and (4.1), the proof is completed.

(cid:3)

6.2. Proof of Proposition 6.1. We ﬁrst recall the result of Zagier

[23, Section 6], and then prove Proposition 6.1.

For N > 0 odd, let

BN =(cid:16)e(cid:0)m1,m2

n1,n2(cid:1)(cid:17)(m1,m2)∈IN (oe)

(n1,n2)∈IN (oe)

,

where the set IN (oe) is deﬁned in (5.4). For this matrix, we can prove
the following theorem, just as Zagier [23, Section 6] did.

Theorem 6.3. For any N > 2 odd, there is an injection

Wod

N −1 ⊕ Wev

N +1 −→ ker BN .

Proof. The proof is almost the same as the proof in [23, Section 6]. We

describe it brieﬂy.

It is easily seen that the assertion that a row vector (an1,n2)(n1,n2)∈IN (oe)

lies in ker BN is equivalent to the statement that the polynomial q(x1, x2) =

P(n1,n2)∈IN (oe) an1,n2xn1−1

xn2−1

satisﬁes

q(x1, x2) − q(x2 − x1, x2) + q(x2 − x1, x1) = (odd polynomial in x1).

With this, one can easily check that the maps

p(x1, x2) = X(n1,n2)∈IN −1(ee)

By deﬁnition, the injectivity of each of these maps separately is obvious.

The injectivity of the combined map is also obvious since the images

have incompatible symmetry properties.

We remark that combining Theorem 6.3 with (1.2), one has

(6.2)

XN >0

dimQ ker BN xN ≥(cid:0)x +

x(cid:1)S(x).

the matrix FN is a block diagonal matrix with blocks BN −k for k =

(6.3)

FN = diag(BN −3, BN −5, . . . , B5).

We then obtain

dimQ ker FN = X3≤k≤N −5

dimQ ker BN −k,

and hence by (6.2) the proof is completed.

(cid:3)

Remark 6.4. It is expected that

which has been checked by Mathematica up to N = 30.

6.3. Proof of Proposition 6.2. In this subsection, we show that
there is an injective linear map from the space PN , which is the space
of (three variables) restricted even period polynomials, to the space
Im FN ∩ ker EN , and give a proof of Proposition 6.2.

Let us denote by PN the Q-vector space spanned by the polynomials

In order to describe the injective linear map from PN to Im FN ∩

(Claim 1) GN(cid:0)ρ(cid:0)PN(cid:1)(cid:1) ⊂ i0(cid:0) ker EN(cid:1),
(Claim 2) GN(cid:0)ρ(cid:0)PN(cid:1)(cid:1) ⊂ i0(cid:0)Im FN(cid:1),
(Claim 3) ker GN ∩ ρ(cid:0)PN(cid:1) = {0},
where we denote by 0 the zero vector in the space dVect

(3)
N . By the claims
1 and 2, we ﬁnd that the map GN is well-deﬁned, and its injectivity

follows from the claim 3. Thus, the proof of Theorem 6.5 is completed

by showing the above claims.

(Claim 1). Deﬁne the square matrix bEN by
n1,n2,n3 (cid:1)(cid:17)(m1,m2,m3)∈bI

We ﬁrst prove GN (ρ(cid:0)PN(cid:1)) ⊂ ker bEN , and then GN(cid:0)ρ(cid:0)PN(cid:1)(cid:1) ⊂ i0(cid:0) ker EN(cid:1).

By (1.1), for p(x1, x2, x3) ∈ PN we have

p(x1, x2, x3)(cid:12)(cid:12)(1 + σ1) = 0,

(6.5)

(6.7)

where σ1 is deﬁned in (5.1). From this, it is easily seen that we have

(6.6)

p(x1, x2, x3) + p(x2, x1, x3) = 0,

which is equivalent to the antisymmetry property of the coeﬃcients of

even period polynomials. Using these two relations, one can check that

the following identity holds:

(cid:0)p(cid:12)(cid:12)(σ1 + σ2)(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:12)(1 + σ1 + σ2) = 0,

which is a special case of [18, Eq.

n1,n2,n3 (cid:1) − δ(cid:0)m1

where we have used the relations (6.9) and (6.10) for the last equality. It
follows that the above last term coincides with the (n1, n2, n3)-th entry

of the row vector −bFN (ρ(p)), i.e. we have GN (ρ(p)) = −bFN (ρ(p)), and
hence GN (ρ(PN )) = bFN (ρ(PN )).
To prove bFN (ρ(PN )) ⊂ i0(cid:0)Im FN(cid:1), we need the following lemma.
Let bBN be the extended matrix of BN deﬁned by
n1,n2(cid:1)(cid:17)(m1,m2)∈IN (oe)∪{(N,0)}
bBN =(cid:16)e(cid:0)m1,m2
(an1,n2)(n1,n2)∈IN (oe)∪{(N,0)} ∈ ker bBN such that aN,0 6= 0.
Proof. Since bB3 = (cid:16)e(cid:0)3,0

3,0(cid:1)(cid:17) = (0), we have ker bB3 = Q. For the case

N ≥ 5 odd, such element in the statement is obtained from the ex-

where Bk is the k-th Bernoulli number (this is [20, Eq.

that we have eisk(x1, x2) = eisk(x2, x1). For N ≥ 5 odd, we set
p(x1, x2) = x1eisN −1(x1, x2) and deﬁne rational numbers an1,n2’s by

Since by deﬁnition we have aN,0(cid:0) = BN+1
(N +1)!(cid:1) 6= 0, the proof is done by
showing that the row vector (an1,n2)(n1,n2)∈IN (oe)∪{(N,0)} lies in ker bBN .
row vector (an1,n2)(n1,n2)∈IN (oe)∪{(N,0)} lies in ker bBN is equivalent to the

As in the proof of Theorem 6.3, one ﬁnds that the assertion that a

q(x1, x2) − q(x2 − x1, x2) + q(x2 − x1, x1) = (odd polynomial in x1).

Now let us denote by q(x1, x2) the left-hand side of (6.11). By [20,
Proposition in p.453] and [10, Lemma in p.14], it follows that

eisk(x1, x2) − eisk(x1 + x2, x2) − eisk(x1 + x2, x1) = 0,

and hence

p(x1, x2) = x1(eisN −1(x1 + x2, x2) + eisN −1(x1 + x2, x1)),

p(x2, x1) = x2eisN −1(x2, x1) = x2eisN −1(x1, x2)

= x2(eisN −1(x1 + x2, x2) + eisN −1(x1 + x2, x1)).

Combining the above equations, one has

p(x1, x2) = −p(x2, x1) + p(x1 + x2, x2) + p(x1 + x2, x1).

Then, one obtains

q(x1, x2) − q(x2 − x1, x2) + q(x2 − x1, x1)

= −p(x2, x1) + p(x2 + x1, x1) + p(x2 − x1, x1) − p(0, x1).

By deﬁnition, it is easily seen that the right-hand is an odd polynomial
in x1, so the proof is concluded.

(cid:3)

such that

Let us turn to the proof of the inclusion bFN(cid:0)ρ(cid:0)PN(cid:1)(cid:1) ⊂ i0(cid:0)Im FN(cid:1).
It suﬃces to show that for any v ∈ ρ(cid:0)PN(cid:1), there exists v′ ∈ Vect(3)

bFN (v) = i0(cid:0)FN (v′)(cid:1).
We note that, similar to (6.3), the matrix bFN is a block diagonal matrix
with blocks bBN −k for k = 3, 5, . . . , N − 3:

bFN = diag(bBN −3, bBN −5, . . . , bB3).

N,0 (cid:1) = 0 whenever N −
m > 0, it is easily seen that the equality bFN (i0(v′)) = i0(cid:0)FN (v′)(cid:1) holds.
Hence bFN(cid:0)ρ(cid:0)PN(cid:1)(cid:1) belongs to i0(cid:0)Im FN(cid:1), so does GN(cid:0)ρ(cid:0)PN(cid:1)(cid:1).

n3. Thus, the relation (6.12) can be reduced to
