Abstract. We consider a topological superconducting wire and use the string order parameter
to investigate the spatiotemporal evolution of the topological order upon a quantum quench
across the critical point. We also analyze the propagation of the initially localized Majorana
bound states after the quench, in order to examine the connection between the topological
order and the unpaired Majorana states, which has been well established at equilibrium but
remains illusive in dynamical situations.
It is found that after the quench the string order
parameters decay over a ﬁnite time and that the decaying behavior is universal, independent
of the wire length and the ﬁnal value of the chemical potential (the quenching parameter). It
is also found that the topological order is revived repeatedly although the amplitude gradually
decreases. Further, the topological order can propagate into the region which was initially in
the non-topological state. It is observed that all these behaviors are in parallel and consistent
with the propagation and dispersion of the Majorana wave functions. Finally, we propose a
local probing method which can measure the non-local topological order.

Spatiotemporal Evolution of Topological Order

1. Introduction

Traditionally, Landau’s symmetry-breaking theory [1, 2, 3] has long provided a universal
paradigm for the states of matter and their transitions. In this paradigm, continuous phase
transitions are driven by the spontaneous symmetry breaking and naturally described by local
order parameters. In recent decades, condensed-matter physics has witnessed the breakdown
of the symmetry-breaking theory in describing symmetry-protected topological states. One of
the most common and earliest examples is the quantum Hall effect [4, 5], where different
quantum Hall states have the same symmetry. Topological phase transitions involve the
change in internal topology rather than symmetry breaking [6, 7]. Necessarily, topological
states are classiﬁed by topological quantum numbers. For example, different quantum Hall
states are classiﬁed by the topological Chern number [8, 9], and topological insulators and
superconductors are characterized by the number of gapless boundary (surface, edge or
endpoint) states [10, 11, 7, 12] separated from gapped bulk states.

From the dynamical point of view, the classiﬁcation in terms of discrete topological
quantum numbers puts a serious limitation. For example, let us ask the question, how long
does it take for a topological order to form? Namely, how does the topological order emerge
or disappear temporally when system parameters are quenched across the critical point?
Within Landau’s paradigm, the approach to the corresponding questions is conceptually clear
because the local order parameters take continuous values and their dynamics are governed
by a differential equation of motion, so called the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation
[13, 14, 15].

Another conceptual difﬁculty in the dynamical description of topological order arises
from the fact that the topological quantum numbers or similar classiﬁcations concern about
the ground state(s).
In order to describe the full aspects of the temporal evolution of the
topological order, one has to take into account the excited states as well as the ground states.
To overcome these issues in the dynamical theory of topological order, a few different
approaches have been carried out previously: In Ref. [16], the ﬁdelity of the ﬁnal state with
respect to the initial state has been examined. Similarly, the survival and revival probabilities
[17, 18] or the Loschmidt echo [19] of the Majorana states after the quench have been also
investigated. In particular, the sudden coupling of the localized Majorana state to the normal
metallic (gapless) lead gives rise to universal features in the evolution of the Majorana wave
function [19]. For a ladder system studied in Ref. [20], the number of excited vortices in
plaquettes was inspected. It has also been suggested to use the Kibble-Zurek mechanism,
which was originally put forward to study the cosmological phase transitions of the early
Universe [21, 22] and later extended to classical phase transitions [23, 24]. This approach is
particularly simple and insightful as it is only based on the competition between the internal
and driving time scales. It has been shown that the original Kibble-Zurek scaling form does
not hold for the topological phase transitions [25, 26] but one can generalize it by properly
taking into account the multi-level structure due to the Majorana bound states [27].

However, none of these approaches directly measures the dynamic topological order;
they either resort to the ﬁdelity to the ground state or to the number of topological defects.
Here we note that in one spatial dimension one can draw a close analogy with the conventional
order by introducing a continuous parameter for the topological order [28]. The cost is
that unlike the conventional order parameter the so-called string order parameter for the
topological order is nonlocal:
It is deﬁned as the the expectation value of a product of
consecutive Majorana operators in a certain range with respect to the dynamical wave
function. It naturally captures the dynamical evolution of the topological order reﬂected in
the wave function, and is considered to be more suitable for experimental observations [28].

On these grounds, in this work we adopt the string order parameter [29, 30, 31] to
investigate the spatiotemporal evolution of the topological order upon a quantum quench
across the critical point in a topological superconducting wire [32, 33, 34, 35]. In addition,
we separately analyze the propagation of the initially localized Majorana bound states after
quenching. By comparing the propagations of the topological order and the Majorana states,
we examine the connection between them in the dynamical situations. It is stressed that while
the close connection between the topological order and the Majorana bound states has been
well established for the ground state, i.e., at equilibrium [32, 33, 34, 35], it is not obvious at
all in the dynamical situations, which involve excited states.

We ﬁnd that after the quench toward the nontopological phase,

the string order
parameters decay over a ﬁnite time before they vanish completely. Notably, this early
decaying behavior is universal in the sense that it does not depend on the wire length and
the ﬁnal value of the chemical potential (the quenched parameter). We also ﬁnd that the
topological order is revived repeatedly although the amplitude gradually decreases. More
interestingly, the topological order propagates into the regions which were initially prepared
in the non-topological state. It is observed that all these behaviors of the dynamical topological
order are in parallel and consistent with the propagation and dispersion of the Majorana wave
functions. Finally, we propose a local probing method which can measure the topological
order which is nonlocal in nature.

The rest of the paper is organized as following: Section 2 describes the model
Hamiltonian for the topological superconducting wire and deﬁnes the string order parameters.
For later use, it summarizes the mathematical and physical properties of the string order
parameters. Section 3 studies the time evolution of the string order parameter in a uniform
wire. It discusses the dynamical aspects of the topological order in terms of the propagation of
the Majorana wave functions. Section 4 investigate the case where only the central part of the
superconducting wire is initially in the topological phase and the outer part is topologically
trivial so that the propagation of the topological order is examined. Section 5 proposes
possible experimental methods to observe our ﬁndings. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper.

2. Topological Superconducting Wires and Topological Order

2.1. Model

In order to explore the time evolution of topological order under a quench, we consider
Kitaev’s spinless p-wave topological superconducting wire with ﬁnite number of sites N and
with open ends described by the tight-binding Hamiltonian [32]

with the hopping amplitude w > 0, the superconducting gap ∆, and the site-dependent
chemical potential µj(t). The phase of the superconducting order parameter is neglected
since it can be always gauged away. The fermion operator cj on site j can be decomposed
into the superposition of two Majorana fermion operators: cj = (γ2j−1 + iγ2j)/2, satisfying

since all the terms in Eq. (1a) either preserve the charge number or change it by even numbers.
This system has a topological invariant, known as the winding number, which takes values ±1
and 0. First consider the uniform and static case with µj(t) = µ. For |µ| > w, the fermion
parity is not broken and the system is in non-topological phase with no unpaired Majorana
fermions as demonstrated in Fig. 1(a). On the other hand, for |µ| < w and ∆ (cid:54)= 0, there are
topological phases with broken Z2 symmetry, and the topological invariant is 1 for ∆ > 0 or
−1 for ∆ < 0. In the topological phases two unpaired Majorana modes arise at two ends of
open and long chains, as shown Figs. 1(b) and (c): For example, for ∆ = w and µ = 0, the
Majorana fermions operators γ1 and γ2N are absent in the Hamiltonian (1b), giving two zero-
energy modes. Similarly, for ∆ = −w and µ = 0, γ2 and γ2N−1 are isolated. In these special
conditions or for inﬁnitely long chain, the ground state is doubly degenerate with deﬁnite
fermion parity P = ±1. The two-fold degeneracy coming from Z2 symmetry cannot be lifted
by small local perturbations unless they involve odd number of fermion operators such as cj or
†
kci, which is the reason why the phase is called topological. The phase transition between
cjc
topological and non-topological phases occurs at |µ| = w, where the system becomes gapless.

2.2. Topological Order

In our study we adopt the nonlocal string order parameter proposed by Bahri and Vishwanath
[29, 30, 31] to measure the topological order in quench dynamics. The physical meaning
of the string order parameter, especially in the Kitaev model (1b), can be understood in
its counterpart spin-1/2 model. Via the Jordan-Wigner transformation, the Kitaev model is
mapped onto the spin XY model in a transverse magnetic ﬁeld described by

topological superconducting wires as a function of the chemical potential µ in equilibrium at

type transition behavior: it is ﬁnite in the topological phase (µ < w) and vanishes in the
non-topological phase (µ > w).

with Jx = (w + ∆)/4 > 0, Jy = (w − ∆)/4 > 0, and hz = −µ/2. The Z2 symmetry in

spin model corresponds to a global spin ﬂip in the σx basis: P =(cid:81)N

Consider the Ising case with w = ∆ (or Jy = 0) for simplicity. This system, like its
counterpart (1a), experiences a phase transition at Jx = |hz| (that is, |µ| = w) from the spin
ordered phase (Jx > |hz|) to the disordered phase (Jx < |hz|). In the spin ordered phase or
ferromagnetic phase, the Z2 symmetry is broken like the topological phase in its counterpart.
The spin order in the ferromagnetic phase is reﬂected in the spin-x correlation between two
spins at end points: for N (cid:29) 1 [36],

So the non-vanishing value of the spin correlation proves the existence of the ferromagnetic
order over the whole chain. Noting that the spin order in the spin model is no other than
the topological order in the original model, the spin correlation can be used to measure the
topological order. Indeed, via the Jordan-Wigner transformation, the spin correlation can be
(cid:105)
expressed in terms of the Majorana operators as
j=2 (−iγ2j−1γ2j)

γ2N−1(cid:105) = (cid:104)(cid:81)N−1

This is the string order parameter for the topological order. Note that the order parameter
is based on the nonlocal operator, a string of Majorana operators, reﬂecting the fact that the
topological order is nonlocal property. On the contrary, its counterpart in the spin model,
N(cid:105), is deﬁned by local operators. The subscript x comes from the fact that the string
(cid:104)σx
order parameter (5) comes from the spin-x correlation. Clearly, this string order parameter
becomes exactly one for the conﬁguration in Fig. 1(b) since the Majorana fermions between
neighboring sites, γ2j and γ2j+1, are maximally paired. Figure 2 demonstrates that the string
order parameter in the Ising case displays the second-order transition behavior.
In general, the ferromagnetic ordering can arise along the spin-y direction if the spin
XY model (Jx, Jy (cid:54)= 0) is taken into account or when the system evolves with time under
the transverse magnetic ﬁeld so that the spins precess. Speciﬁcally, the spin-y correlation

Interestingly, this string order parameter vanishes for the conﬁguration in Fig. 1(b) but
becomes one for that in Fig. 1(c). Therefore, the spin-x and -y correlations capture two
different kinds of topological order for which the topological invariant is 1 or −1, respectively.
Hence, the sum of two order parameters deﬁnes the total topological order:

which is no other than the spin correlation (cid:104)σx

From the dynamical point of view, the most fascinating aspect of this string order
parameter is that it is deﬁned with respect to the wave function, not to the Hamiltonian. The
so-called topological invariants which are commonly used to clarify the topological property
of the system at equilibrium are basically the properties of the Hamiltonian. Therefore they
are inadequate for the study of the evolution of the topological order triggered by the change
of the Hamiltonian with time such as quench. Quite contrary, the string order parameter
Stop is the expectation value of Majorana operators with respect to the wave function which
evolves with time, so it can capture the dynamical evolution of the topological order in the
wave function.

The string order parameters can be deﬁned over a part of the chain as well as the whole.

For later use, we deﬁne the string order parameters for the region from site j1 to j2 as

Stop,x(j1, j2) = (cid:104)(cid:81)j2−1

2.3. Time Evolution and Majorana Correlation Matrix
In order to calculate the string order parameter, we ﬁrst introduce a 2N ×2N skew-symmetric
Majorana correlation matrix C(t) whose elements are deﬁned by
Ckk(cid:48)(t) = −i ((cid:104)γk(t)γk(cid:48)(t)(cid:105) − δkk(cid:48))

(9)
for k, k(cid:48) = 1,··· , 2N. The Hamiltonian (1a) is quadratic and one can apply Wick’s theorem
to evaluate the string order parameter. Wick’s theorem tells us that the expectation value of the
products of γk is the sum of all the possible products of the expectation values of pairs. The
permutation between operators can change the overall sign if it happens in an odd number.
The results can thus be expressed in terms of Pfafﬁan of the Majorana correlation matrix
[37, 38]. More explicitly,

Stop,x(j1, j2) = Pf[C (x)(j1, j2)], Stop,y(j1, j2) = − Pf[C (y)(j1, j2)],

(10)
where C (x)(j1, j2) and C (y)(j1, j2) are 2(j2 − j1) × 2(j2 − j1) submatrices of C formed by
rows and columns 2j1, 2j1 + 1,··· , 2j2 − 2, 2j2 − 1 and 2j1 − 1, 2j1 + 1, 2j1 + 2,··· , 2j2 −
3, 2j2 − 2, 2j2, respectively.

Spatiotemporal Evolution of Topological Order

equations of motion for the Majorana operators lead to the differential equation for (cid:101)Ckk(cid:48)(t) =

Now we formulate the time evolution of the correlation matrix C(t). The Heisenberg

since U (t) is orthogonal matrix. Note that if C(0) is real, the C(t) is real for all time t.

2.4. General Structure of Majorana Correlation Matrix

In general, the wave functions of the two Majorana edge states overlap with each other, giving
rise to a ﬁnite energy splitting (although exponentially small for a long chain). So the ground
state has a deﬁnite fermion parity: In our study we choose P = 1. Note that the fermion parity,
Eq. (2), is no other than the Pfafﬁan of C: P = Pf[C]. Therefore, Pf[C] = 1 throughout the
time evolution. On the other hand, the real 2N × 2N skew-symmetric matrix can be always
block-diagonalized by an orthogonal matrix V : C = V DV t with

where λn are real. Since Pf[C] = det[V ] Pf[D] = Pf[D] = (cid:81)N

n=1 λn = 1 and the
correlation between the Majorana operators cannot be larger than 1 in magnitude, one can
conclude that λn = 1 for all n. It leads to an interesting physical implication: In a proper
basis, each of 2N Majorana fermions forms a pair with another single Majorana fermion
(not a superposition of pairs with different Majorana fermions), resulting in N deﬁnite pairs.
The simplest examples are shown in Figs. 1(b) and (c); with the fermion parity ﬁxed, two
edge Majorana fermions, isolated otherwise, should form a non-local pair. It is stressed that
for a general dynamical wavefunction the Majorana fermions are not necessarily localized
at one site as in Figs. 1(b) and (c), but they can move along the wire or disperse with time.
Such propagation and spread of each Majorana fermion are reﬂected in the time evolution
matrix U (t). In other words, by tracking down the time evolution of each column of U (t),
one can ﬁnd that which Majorana fermion forms a pair with which Majorana fermion at each
time. Importantly, this information in turn can be used to interpret the dynamical change of
Stop with time. For example, Stop,x(j1, j2) would be maximal when the Majorana fermions
γ2j1 , γ2j1+1,··· , γ2j2−2, γ2j2−1 strongly form pairs by themselves. If any of them is bound
to that outside the region, then the topological order in that region must decrease.

2.5. Quench Dynamics

the study,

for simplicity, we take the Ising limit

in which the p-wave
Throughout
superconducting order parameter ∆ is equal to the hopping amplitude w: w+ = w and
w− = 0. The Ising case can reveal the key essence of the dynamics of the topological
order. Since we are interested in the quench dynamics of the system, the parameters of
the system are driven to change in time. Taking into account the feasibility of experimental
realization, the hopping amplitude as well as the superconducting gap is ﬁxed in time and
position-independent, while the position-dependent chemical potential µj(t), which can be
easily controlled experimentally, is varied with time so that the whole or a part of the system
experience dynamical topological phase transition.

In our study we consider two cases:

In the ﬁrst case, the wire is uniform so that

µj(t) = µ(t) and a quantum quench is applied at time t = 0

(cid:40)

µ(t) =

0,
µf ,

t < 0
t > 0

(18)

(cid:40)

so that the whole wire is driven from the deep topological phase (µ = 0) to the non-topological
phase (µ = µf > w). In the second case, only the central region with Nsys sites (called
as the system) is initially prepared in the topological phase (µj = µsys = 0) and the side
regions (called as the environment) with Nenv ≡ (N − Nsys)/2 sites in each side are in the
non-topological phase (µj = µenv > w). At time t = 0, the system part is driven to the
non-topological phase like in the environment:

µsys(t) =

0,
µf ,

t < 0
t > 0

and µenv(t) = µf .

(19)

For convenience, we set  = 1 and focus on the zero temperature case.

3. Time Evolution of Topological Order in Uniform Wire

In this section we consider the quantum quench of a uniform p-wave superconducting wire
from the topological to non-topological phase according to Eq. (18). Figure 3 displays the

Spatiotemporal Evolution of Topological Order

time evolution of Stop after the quantum quench at t = 0. Here we summarize the two
characteristic behaviors of the string order parameter uncovered in Fig. 3 (and below we
explain them in terms of the motion of Majorana fermions): (i) The topological orders deﬁned
by Eqs. (5), (6), and (7) do not die away immediately after the quench, but instead decay with
time before they vanish completely. Interestingly, the shape of Stop(t) during the decay and
the decaying time tdecay are quite universal: As long as µf is not too close to the transition
point w, we numerically ﬁnd wtdecay ≈ π, which is immune to the wire length N and the ﬁnal
value of the chemical potential µf . This size-independence is quite interesting considering
that the topological order is based on the nonlocal products of operators [see Eqs. (5) and (6)].
We also ﬁnd that as long as µf > w the overall behavior of Stop is qualitatively same for all
values of µf , except additional small oscillations whose amplitude and period decrease with
increasing µf , as seen in Fig. 3(a). (ii) The topological order is revived repeatedly although
the amplitude gradually decreases. Speciﬁcally, the topological order reappears at t ≈ nN/w
(n = 1, 2,··· ) and is kept for a duration time which is around 2tdecay, forming peaks centered
at t ≈ nN/w + tdecay, as seen in Figs. 3(a) and (b). The revival period, the time between the
peaks in Stop(t), is deﬁnitely related to the system size: trevival ∼ N/w. Surely, the revival is
the ﬁnite-size effect. Figure 3(c) shows that the maximum amplitude of Stop at its ﬁrst revival
decreases with the system size and that its dependence on N is immune to the quench strength

as long as µf is sufﬁciently larger than w. This observation can be explained in terms of the
dispersion of the Majorana wave function, which will be discussed in greater detail later. Note
that a similar kind of revival of Majorana physics has been reported by examining the survival
probability of edge Majorana states in the same system [17]. In their study the survival of
local Majorana wave function is maximal in the quench to the transition point (µf = w).
However, the revival of non-local topological order in our study turns out to be quite robust
no mater what value µf has.

In passing, we examine and compare the time evolutions of different string order
parameters, Stop,x/y as well as Stop, more closely. Figure 4 shows that unlike Stop
the string order parameters Stop,x/y oscillate rapidly in the anti-synchronized way. The
initial oscillation with π/2 phase difference between Stop,x/y can be understood in the spin
language.
Initially, the ferromagnetic coupling Jx = w/2 aligns all the spins in the x
direction. Turning on the transverse magnetic ﬁeld hz makes the spins precess in the xy
plane, transferring the correlation in the x direction into that in the y direction and vice versa.
The spin precession under the transverse ﬁeld is responsible for the oscillation whose period
is then inversely proportional to 1/|hz| ∝ 1/µf .

All those aspects of the change of the string order parameter with time can be explained
in terms of the time evolution of Majorana wave function reﬂected in the matrix U (t), as
we discuss in the remaining of the section. Figure 5 displays the time evolution of Majorana
wave function: Each row of the density plots corresponds to the wave function of the Majorana
state ordered in such a way that at t = 0 the nth state (1 ≤ n ≤ 2N) is localized at Majorana
site k = n. Hence, according to the initial pairing between Majorana fermions depicted in
Fig. 1(b), the n = 2j and 2j + 1 Majorana states (j = 1, 2,··· , N − 1) are paired and the
edge Majorana states (n = 1 and 2N) are also paired due to the fermion parity ﬁxing [see the
green and red lines in Fig. 5(a)]. While the wave functions of the Majorana states change with
time, theses pairings are maintained throughout the time evolution. Turning on the chemical
potential couples γ2j−1 and γ2j so that the Majorana fermions hop between two Majorana
sites in a real site j. At t = t1 ≈ π/2µf , the Majorana fermions in a real site exchange
between them [see Fig. 5(b)] so that the Majorana conﬁguration is almost same as Fig. 1(c),
resulting in Stop,x = 0 and Stop,y ≈ 1. At t = t2 ≈ π/µf , the Majorana fermions return to
their starting points [see Fig. 5(c)], restoring Stop,x ≈ 1 almost with Stop,y = 0.

topological superconducting wires after the quench, Eq. (18) with µf /w = 10. The times

Stop,x = 0 for the ﬁrst time, (c) t = t2 when Stop,y = 0 for the second time, (d) t = t3

oscillation of Stop,x/y is maximal again, (g) t = t6 = N/w, (h) t = t7 ≈ N/w + tdecay
when Stop is fully restored, and (i) t = 2t7. The green and red lines connecting rows indicates
the pairing between the pairs of Majorana states.

The oscillation is accompanied with the dispersion of the Majorana states, making the
pairing between the bulk and edge Majorana states gradually increasing and accordingly
weakening Stop. On top of it, each Majorana wave function (except n = 1, 2N Majorana
states) is split into two propagation modes, moving in opposite directions [see Figs. 5(d) and
(e)]. At t = t4 ≈ π/w [see Fig. 5(e)], the initial edge Majorana states (n = 1, 2N) enter into
the bulk completely, and the propagation of split Majorana states, initially starting in the bulk,
hits the ends of the chain so that the correlation between the bulk and edge Majorana fermions
becomes maximal, resulting in the vanishing of Stop,x/y and Stop. Since the decaying of
the topological order happens when the initial edge Majorana states enter into the bulk, the

decaying time does not depend on the system size. Also, noting that the propagation speed of
the Majorana states is mainly determined by the hopping amplitude w, the chemical potential
strength does not affect the decaying time tdecay.
the topological order parameters Stop and Stop,x/y remain being
suppressed except around t ∼ N/2w in which Stop,x and Stop,y oscillate out of phase. A
typical distribution of Majorana states in that period is shown in Fig. 5(f). One can see that
the Majorana states for n = 8 ∼ 13 become mostly localized at the boundaries and form
pairs by themselves: γ1 and γ2N , and γ2 and γ2N−1, simultaneously. The other Majorana
states inside the bulk are binding by themselves as well. It satisﬁes the condition to have
ﬁnite Stop,x/y as shown in Fig. 4. Note that the pairing inside the bulk is not like those in
Fig. 1(b) nor (c), where the Majorana fermions in neighboring sites form pairs, but instead is
more like that in Fig. 1(a), where the Majorana fermions in the same site is bound. Hence, it
results in the almost perfect cancellation between Stop,x and Stop,y, making Stop vanish. In
this respect, Stop, not Stop,x nor Stop,y, is the more adequate order parameter to measure the
topological order.

At t = t6 = N/w [see Fig. 5(g)], the front part of the initial edge Majorana wave
function (n = 1, 2N ) starts to reach the opposite ends, and the bulk Majorana states which
was split becomes reunited. That is, apart from the dispersion of Majorana states, the
Majorana conﬁguration starts to be restored to the initial one with reverse ordering, which
accordingly revives the topological order. At t = t7 ≈ N/w + tdecay [see Fig. 5(h)], the
topological order is maximally restored, restoring the initial Majorana conﬁguration. Note that
while the bulk states are considerably dispersed, the Majorana states for n = 1, 2N, forming a
strong pair, are still quite localized at the edges. This is the reason why the restoration of Stop
is quite strong. Finally, at t = 2t7 ≈ 2N/w [see Fig. 5(i)], the Majorana conﬁguration returns
to the initial one with much dispersion, leading to the second revival of the topological order.
Note that our analysis which tracks down the pairing between Majorana states explains why
the revival period of the topological order is N/w, the half of the round-trip period (= 2N/w)
of Majorana states.
Now we examine the time evolution of Stop(j1, j2) for central segments of the wire from
site j1 to site j2 = N +1−j1. Figure 6 shows that the revival of the topological order happens
for all Stop(j1, j2) simultaneously. It means that the pairing of Majorana fermions is like that
in Figs. 1(b) or (c) in any length scale, once the order is restored. For the quench in uniform
wires, this is the case as can be seen in Figs. 5(h) and (i).

Finally, we address interesting relations between the string order parameters Stop,x/y
and the elements of the correlation matrix C. From the observations up to now, it is obvious
that Stop,x increases as the Majorana fermions γk on sites k = 2,··· , 2N − 1 form strong

pairs by themselves. Under the condition that the fermion parity is ﬁxed, every Majorana
fermion should be bound to one of others. Hence, with Stop,x close to one by binding γk for
k = 2,··· , 2N −1, a strong pair between γ1 and γ2N should be formed. It implies that Stop,x
and C1,2N are positively correlated. A similar argument also leads to a positive correlation
between Stop,y and C2,2N−1. As proven in Appendix A, this kind of correlations is exact:

Stop,x = C1,2N
Stop,y = −C2,2N−1

(20a)
(20b)

[see Eqs. (A.7) and (A.8)]. Therefore, the topological order can be obtained simply from the
correlations between edge Majorana fermions. This result may lead to a false understanding
that the topological order is in fact local since C1,2N or C2,2N−1 are local correlations.
However, we can argue that the topological order is really nonlocal in two ways: (i) These
relations, Eqs. (20a) and (20b) are based on the assumption that the fermion parity is ﬁxed.
However, as pointed out in Ref. [31], the string order parameter is insensitive to the linear
combination of degenerate ground states with different parities. So even when the relations
between the string order parameter and the edge Majorana correlation are not valid, the
nonlocal string order parameter is still unambiguously deﬁned. (ii) The derivation leading to
Eqs. (20a) and (20b) states that the string order parameter over a part of the system is related
to the correlation outside the part [see Eq. (A.9)]. Equations (20a) and (20b) are special cases
where the remaining part consists of only two (edge) Majorana fermions. So the topological
order is truly global property of the system, reﬂecting the correlations all over the system.

4. Propagation of Topological Order into Non-Topological Regions

Now we consider the case in which only a central part (“system” with Nsys sites) of the
superconducting wire is initially in topological phase and the outer part (“environment”
with Nenv sites on the left and another Nenv sites on the right) is in non-topological phase,
according to Eq. (19). Figure 7 shows the time evolution of Stop,x(j1, j2) and Stop(j1, j2)
for every (centered) region (we take j1 and j2 symmetrically so that j2 = N + 1 − j1) of
the wire with N = 30 and Nsys = 10 (accordingly, Nenv = 10) after a sudden quench. At
t = 0, the system part is in topological phase so that Stop,x(j1, j2) = Stop(j1, j2) = 1 for

Figure 8. Density plot of the time evolution matrix |Ukn| for the time evolution of N = 30
and Nsys = 10 topological superconducting wires initially prepared as described in Fig. 7.
The times at which the matrix elements are taken are indicated in Fig. 7: (a) t = t8 when
Stop(5, 26) becomes maximal for the ﬁrst time, (b) t = t9 when Stop(1, 30) becomes
maximal for the ﬁrst time, and (c) t = t10 when Stop(11, 20) is fully revived for the ﬁrst
time. In all cases, Stop,y ≈ 0. The green and red lines connecting rows (in the right side of
the ﬁgures) indicates the pairing between the pairs of Majorana states. The red vertical lines
indicate the regions in which the topological order is measured. The blue small circles and
(solid and dotted) lines connecting them pick the Majorana pairs which mostly contributes to
the corresponding Stop,x.

Nenv < j1 ≤ N/2. However, the string order parameters for larger regions which extend into
the environment part are initially zero: Stop,x(j1, j2) = 0 for j1 ≤ Nenv since γ2j1 at site j1
in the environment region form a strong pair with γ2j1−1 which is not included in the string
of Majorana operators γ2j1γ2j1+1 ··· γ2j2−1 for Stop,x(j1, j2) [see Eq. (8a)].

After quench, Stop,x(j1, j2) and Stop(j1, j2) in the system part decays with time, which
is almost similar to the decay behavior observed in the uniform case [compare with Fig. 6].
However, very interestingly, the topological order parameters for larger region, which are
initially zero, become ﬁnite after some time passes [follow the solid and dotted lines in
Fig. 8]. We ﬁnd that the time for Stop(j1, j2) with j1 ≤ Nenv to be maximally increased is
approximately (Nenv + 1− j1)/w: For example, the time when Stop(1, N ) becomes maximal
is around Nenv/w. These ﬁndings strongly suggest that the topological order propagates into
the non-topological region with a constant velocity after the quench.

The mechanism for the propagation of the topological order can be understood in terms
of the time evolution of Majorana wave functions, as in the uniform case. Figure 8(a) shows
the snapshot of Majorana wave function at t = t8 when Stop(j1, j2) for j1 = 5 is maximal

with Stop,x(j1, j2) ≈ Stop(j1, j2) and Stop,y(j1, j2) ≈ 0 as marked in Fig. 7(b). The
Majorana fermions which are initially inside the system part and form the topological pairing
are split and propagate into either direction. At t = t8, the main part of the Majorana wave
functions covers the whole region of Majorana sites for Stop(j1, j2) with j1 = 5 as marked
by red vertical lines in Fig. 8(a). It clearly reveals that the propagation of the topological
order is connected to that of the Majorana wave functions, which determines the propagation
speed. The blue circles and lines connecting them in the ﬁgure pick some of the Majorana
pairings which make ﬁnite contribution to Stop,x and Stop. Moreover, since the Majorana
wave function has been spatially split, the pairing of Majorana fermions contributing to the
topological order is now nonlocal: The Majorana fermions are bound not only to the nearest
neighboring one but also to that moving in the opposite direction with increasing distance
between them (see the connections with dotted lines). Note that this nonlocal pairing leads
to the vanishing of Stop(j(cid:48)
1 > j1: While the topological order arises in
the region (j1, j2) for j1 = 5 at t = t8, it does not for smaller region. The reason is that
the pairing of Majorana fermions inside the smaller region is not closed by themselves due to
the nonlocal pairing. Some of Majorana fermions are bound to those outside the region. It is
quite different from the uniform case in which the topological order is revived in all scales.
On the other hand, we would like to point out that even when Stop(j1, j2) is maximal its value
is rather small: For example, Stop(j1, j2) ≈ 0.2 for j1 = 5. It is because the non-topological
pairing of Majorana fermions starting from the environment part is also propagating into that
region (j1, j2).

2) for almost all j(cid:48)

1, j(cid:48)

The topological order eventually covers the whole wire, which occurs at t = t9 as seen
in Fig. 7. At this time, the Majorana fermions forming the topological pairing reach their
outermost boundaries which are k = 2 and 2N − 1 for Stop,x [see the red vertical lines
in Fig. 8(b)]. So, although not perfect, the Majorana pairings become similar to those in
Fig. 1(b) with additional nonlocal pairings. After t = t9, the Majorana fermions maintaining
the topological pairing are reﬂected at the boundaries and some of them going inside the wire
so that the region having the topological order shrinks (follow the solid lines in Fig. 7). As
the Majorana wave functions propagate, the topological region should repeat expanding and
shrinking. However, the dispersion of the Majorana wave function causes topological order
to gradually decay.

While the topological region is determined mainly by the outermost boundaries of

quench used in Fig. 7. The shaded boxes mark the time interval in which those two quantities
are in perfect or good agreement with each other.

Majorana wave function with topological paring, the inner boundaries of Majorana fermions
can also deﬁne the topological region. Figure 8(c) shows the Majorana wave function at
t = t10 when Stop(j1, j2) for the system part (j1 = 11) is revived. While this revival is not
due to the recombination of split Majorana wave function as happens in Fig. 5(g), it can be
also explained in terms of the time evolution of Majorana wave functions. First, consider the
initial edge Majorana fermions, γ2×11−1 and γ2×20 for the topological system part, connected
by the red dotted line in Fig. 8. After the quench, they are split and the two parts of each of
them move outward and inward, respectively. So after some time passes (around t = t10/2)
the inner parts of their split Majorana wave functions cross each other. After that, they deﬁne
the boundaries of another topological region in which the topological pairing is signiﬁcant
as shown in Fig. 8(c). Such a revival of the topological order happens along the dotted lines
in Fig. 7. Since the boundary of the topological region is moving with time, this topological
order also propagates along the wire.

Since the propagation of the Majorana wave function is accompanied with its dispersion,
the topological order when it covers the whole wire should be weaker for longer wires.
Figure 9 clearly conﬁrms this expectation: Stop at its ﬁrst maximum decreases monotonically
with increasing Nenv, except small additional oscillations observed for µf close to w.
It
shows that as long as µf is large enough the value of µf does not affect the propagation of the
topological order as observed in the uniform case [compare with Fig. 3(c)].

In the previous section, we observed interesting relations between the string order
parameters and the elements of the Majorana correlation matrix, such as Eqs. (20a) and (20b),
for the uniform wire. Here we demonstrate that similar relations hold in the non-uniform
case as well. First, as seen in Fig. 10, the nonlocal topological order for the whole system,
Stop,x = Stop,x(1, 2N ) is exactly equal to the correlation C1,2N between Majorana fermions
at the ends of wire, which in fact comes from the exact identity, see Eq. (20a). Then, one
may question if a similar relation such as Stop,x(j1, j2) = C2j1−1,2j2 can hold for a part of
the system. As shown in Appendix A, there is no such equation identity. However, Fig. 10
demonstrates that the relation can be valid at least for a ﬁnite time after the quench. The
temporary agreement between Stop,x(j1, j2) and C2j1−1,2j2 can be understood in terms of
the general relation, Eq. (A.9). Until the topological order spreads over the region (j1, j2),
one can assume that the outer region remains strictly in the non-topological phase so that the
Majorana fermions in that region form the non-topological pairings like in Fig. 1(a) and the

5. Experimental Detection of Topological Order

While from the theoretical point of view the notion of the topological order is interesting and
useful in understanding new quantum states of matter, its direct measurement is highly non-
trivial even at the conceptual level since it is a nonlocal property. In this respect, the existence
of the string order parameter is encouraging because (although nonlocal) it is suitable with
current technology for experimental measurement [28].

Here we propose a local and direct experimental way to probe the topological order. It
is based on the relations between the string order parameters Stop,x/y and the elements of the
correlation matrix C [see Eqs. (20a) and (20b)] discussed in Sections 3 and 4. First, note that
the relations (20a) and (20b) allows us to rewrite the string order parameter Stop into

Spatiotemporal Evolution of Topological Order
where c± = (c1 ± cN )/
2 are the fermion operators on the hybridized fermionic states
between two end sites. Therefore, the string order parameter can be measured by probing the
occupancy of the hybridized state c± between the two end-site electrons c1 and cN .

Figure 11 shows the schematics of two experimental setups to probe the hybridized states
c±. The quantum dot (the orange disc in Fig. 11) is tunnel coupled to the end sites 1 and N of
the topological superconducting wire. It is described by the Hamiltonian of the standard form

Hprobe = −wp d†(cid:16)

eiΦ/Φ0 c1 + cN

(23)

where wp is the coupling strength (assumed to be the same for c1 and cN for simplicity), d and
d† are quantum dot electron operators, Φ is the additional ﬂux through the loop (the brown
arrow in Fig. 11) formed by the wire and the quantum dot, and Φ0 = h/e is the magnetic
ﬂux quantum. When Φ/Φ0 = 0, the hybridized electron c+ (c−) can (cannot) tunnel onto the
quantum dot because of the constructive (destructive) interference. For Φ/Φ0 = π, it is the
other way around. Therefore, by monitoring the excess electrons on the quantum dot, one can
†
selectively detect the occupancies (cid:104)c
±c±(cid:105).

To monitor the excess charge on the quantum dot, there are several schemes available
in the present state-of-the-art technology. Here we consider two different schemes. The
ﬁrst scheme [Fig. 11 (a)] is, in spirit, the same as the quantum optical method of detecting
the occupancy of excited atomic levels by observing the emitted photons [39] as no photon
is emitted by a ground-state atom. Operationally, it is similar to the on-demand single-
electron emitter [40, 41, 42]: An excess electron on the dot is taken out to an additional
normal lead L attached to the dot by temporally manipulating the dot energy level d(t).
The dot-lead coupling is characterized by the level-broadening parameter ΓL. Throughout
the measurement procedure, a bias voltage is applied so that µL < µ, where µL and µ are
the chemical potentials of the normal lead and the system, respectively. Initially, d is set
higher than µ so that no electron can tunnel into the quantum dot. At the desired moment of
measurement, d is lowered and tuned between µL and µ (µL < d < µ). The electron (if
any) occupying the hybridized state c± will tunnel into the quantum dot and then to the normal
lead. After a certain period τp of time, d is pushed back higher than µ. This procedure is
repeated with interval τr (1/τr is typically in the GHz range [40, 41, 42]) many times enough
for the electric current resolution. When the system is in the topological state, the Majorana
states at the ends of the wire are expected to be true bound states, the current is estimated to
be

(wp (cid:28) ΓL)

(24)

if the hybridized state c± is occupied; the current vanishes otherwise.

In the second scheme [Fig. 11 (b)], the excess electron on the quantum dot is probed by
continuously monitoring the current through a nearby quantum point contact [43, 44, 46, 47].
It is possible because the dot electron casts an additional Coulomb potential and reduces the
transmission probability from TQPC to T (cid:48)
QPC) through the
quantum point contact. The change in the current is given by

either case, the change in charge on the quantum dot can be monitored as fast as the radio-
frequency range. More detailed analyses including the effects of back-action noise are referred

6. Conclusion

We have considered a wire of topological superconductor and studied the temporal evolution
of the topological order upon a quantum quench across the critical point in terms of the string
order parameter. Unlike topological quantum numbers, which are commonly used to describe
the equilibrium topological order, the string order parameter is deﬁned with respect to the full
dynamical wave function and naturally captures the dynamical evolution of the topological
order reﬂected in the wave function. It is considered to be more suitable for experimental
observations [28]. We have found that the topological orders vanish with a ﬁnite decaying
time and that the initial decaying behavior is universal in the sense that it does not depend
on the wire length and the ﬁnal value of the chemical potential (the quenching parameter).
The revival of the topological order in ﬁnite-size wires and the propagation of the topological
order into the region which was initially in the non-topological state have been observed
and explained in terms of the propagation and dispersion of the Majorana wave functions.
Finally, we have found the exact relations between the string order parameters and some local
correlations, which are valid as long as the fermion parity is well deﬁned. Based on these
relations we have proposed a local probing method which allows to measure the topological
order which is supposed to be nonlocal.

Appendix A. Majorana Correlation Matrix and Topological Order

In this appendix we prove that the string order parameter over a part of the system is ultimately
related to the correlation outside of that region and ﬁnd the exact relation between them.

The Majorana correlation matrix C(t) deﬁned in Eq. (9) has the following properties as

In other words, C = V DV t where V is an

From the property (iii), one can derive

(A.2)
Now we recall the generalized Cramer’s rule [52]: For a nonsingular n× n matrix A and

det XI,J =

where I = {i1, i2,··· , ik} and J = {j1, j2,··· , jk} are ordered sets of indices (1 ≤ i1 ≤
··· ≤ ik ≤ n and 1 ≤ j1 ≤ ··· ≤ jk ≤ m), XI,J is the k × k submatrix of X with rows in
I and columns in J , and AB(I,J ) is the n × n matrix formed by replacing the ith
s column
of A by the jth
In Eq. (A.3), we substitute A = C, X = C−1, B = 12N×2N , and J = I. Then, the

Cramer’s rule gives rise to

(A.4)
since det AB(I,I) = det C ¯I, ¯I, where ¯I (also assumed to be ordered) is complementary to
I. Applying the properties (i-iii) of the Majorana correlation matrix C, we get

det C−1I,I =

det C ¯I, ¯I
det C

det CI,I = det C ¯I, ¯I

or Pf[CI,I]2 = Pf[C ¯I, ¯I]2

(A.5)

since CI,I and C ¯I, ¯I are also skew-symmetric. Explicit comparison between Pf[CI,I] and
Pf[C ¯I, ¯I] leads to

(A.6)
where the P (J ) is the number of permutations needed to transform the set of indices
{1, 2, . . . , 2N} to {i1, i2,··· , ik
}. Equation (A.6) is the

Eq. (A.6) leads to

Also, with I = {2, 2N − 1}, we obtain

C1,2N (t) = Pf[CI,I] = Pf[C ¯I, ¯I] = Stop,x.

C2,2N−1(t) = Pf[CI,I] = Pf[C ¯I, ¯I] = −Stop,y.

(A.7)

(A.8)

These are very interesting relations. Seemingly, the nonlocal string order parameters are
replaced by local correlations between edge Majorana fermions. However, it does not
mean that the topological order can be local. To the contrary, these relations insist that the
topological order is really nonlocal, which will be clariﬁed in the case (2) below. Note that
these relations are valid only when the fermion parity is ﬁxed.

(2) Suppose that J = {2j1, 2j1 + 1,··· , 2j2 − 2, 2j2 − 1}. Then,

Stop,x(j1, j2) = Pf[CJ ,J ] = Pf[C ¯J , ¯J ].

(A.9)

It states that the string order parameter over a part of the system (for example, from site j1 to
site j2) is ultimately related to the correlation outside of the part over which the topological
order is examined. This in turn seems to reﬂect the fact that the topological order is a global
(rather than local) property.
