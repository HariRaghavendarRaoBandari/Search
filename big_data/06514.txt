Italy

(Dated: 5 April 2016)

We review some of the exactly solvable one dimensional continuum ﬂuid models of equilibrium classical
statistical mechanics under the uniﬁed setting of functional integration in one dimension. We make some
further developments and remarks concerning ﬂuids with non pairwise-additive interaction. We then apply
our developments to the study of a particular non pairwise-additive Gaussian model for which we are unable
to ﬁnd a well deﬁned thermodynamics.

INTRODUCTION

The physics of one dimensional systems is simpler than
that one of higher dimensional ones. Speciﬁcally the free
energy of an interacting gas, a ﬂuid, has had an exact
solution only in one dimension. The apparent simplic-
ity of restricting motion to one spatial dimension is well
known and has had much appeal. But what is the re-
lation between the exactly soluble models of the one di-
mensional world and the richer and puzzling problems
of the three dimensional one? A one dimensional gas
was once thought to be incapable even of condensation.
Later with the introduction of inﬁnite range forces it has
been made to condense, but even so this liquid can never
freeze. What one ﬁnds is that these models are useful
tests of approximate mathematical methods, the solu-
tions of these models are surprisingly complex and inter-
esting, physical applications are often and unexpectedly
discovered, and more importantly they educate us to the
need of rigorous and exact analysis with which one can
have a better deﬁnition of reality. The fact that particles
can get around each other is responsible for much of the
structure of the ordinary world, and is also responsible
for the diﬃculties which the mathematical physicist en-
counter in studying it. In one dimension we renounce to
some of the structure in favor of the possibility of obtain-
ing an exact solution.

The importance of one dimensional physics also lies in
the fact that a number of many-body problems in higher
dimensions can be accurately mapped into one dimen-
sional problems.

L´eon Van Hove showed that one dimensional ﬂuids
with impenetrable particles each one interacting with a
ﬁnite number of neighbors do not have a phase transition
at a non zero temperature1.

In this work I will describe a way of simplifying the cal-
culation of the grand canonical partition function of an
ensemble of classical particles living in a one dimensional

world and interacting with a given pair-potential v, orig-
inally described by Edwards and Lenard in their paper
2 which I will call EL from now on. Using the notion of
a general Gaussian random process and Kac’s theorem,
they show how it is possible to express the grand partition
function as a one dimensional integral of the fundamen-
tal solution of a given partial diﬀerential equation. The
kind of partial diﬀerential equation will be ﬁxed by the
kind of diﬀusion equation satisﬁed by the Gaussian ran-
dom process. In sections II, III, and IV I will present EL’s
functional integration technique. In subsection V B I will
show how, in EL, the properties of the Wiener process
are used to solve “Edwards’ model” or “Lenard’s model”.
I will then show, in subsection V A, how one can use the
properties of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process to solve the
“Kac-Baker’s model”.

The main original contribution given in this work lies
in section VIII where I show how a generalized Ornstein-
Uhlenbeck process can be used to solve models with a
more general non pairwise-additive interaction potential.
In Section VI I show how EL propose to extract thermo-
dynamical informations from their functional integration
treatment and in section VII I show, following EL, how
it is possible to reduce the search of the grand partition
function, to a characteristic value problem, when the dif-
fusion equation is independent of “time”. In section VIII
I show how one has to renounce to this reduction, for
the generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process satisfying, in
general, a non separable diﬀusion equation. In subsec-
tion VIII A I then apply the theoretical framework of
such section to a non pairwise-additive penetrable Gaus-
sian interaction model.
In particular I will prove that
this model is thermodynamically unstable in its attrac-
tive version (which is also not H-stable) and I will ﬁnd
an approximate expression for the grand partition func-
tion of the repulsive version (which clearly is H-stable)
in terms of a triple series one of which is alternating.

More recently3 the functional integral technique of Ed-
wards and Lenard has been used to solve the statistical
mechanics of a one dimensional Coulomb gas with bound-
ary interactions as a one dimensional model for a colloidal
and soap ﬁlm.

I think that the success of the functional integration
method described in this work to ﬁnd exact solutions of
the equilibrium classical (non-quantum) statistical me-
chanics problem of one dimensional ﬂuids has certainly
been one of the motivations for the popularity acquired
by functional integration after the pioneering develop-
ments of Marc Kac and Richard Feynman. The link with
the theory of stochastic processes is just a beautiful ex-
ample of how many diﬀerent theoretical frameworks come
together in the few exact solutions of classical many-body
problems.

II. THE PROBLEM

The problem is to simplify the calculation of the grand
canonical partition function of a system of particles in
the segment [0, L] whose positions are labeled by xi with
i = 1, 2, . . . , N , in thermal equilibrium at a reduced tem-
perature θ, namely,

Ω =

∞

XN =0

zN

N ! Z L

0

dxN ···Z L

0

dx1 e− VN (x1,...,xN )

θ

.(2.1)

EL consider the total potential energy of the system to
be,

VN (x1, . . . , xN ) =

N

N

Xi=1

Xj=1

w(xi, xj ),

(2.2)

where w(xi, xj ) is a function of two variables depending
on the pair-potential v(|xi−xj|) and the kind of reservoir
exchanging particles with the system.

The main idea of EL, is to rewrite the grand partition

function as a functional average,

0 dx′ F (φ(x′))E
Ω =DeR L
=* ∞
N !Z L
XN =0

1

0

dxN ···Z L

0

(2.3)

dx1

F (φ(xi))+ .

N

Yi=1

And then choose F (φ) = z exp(iσφ), to get,

2

Ω =
∞

XN =0

zN

N ! Z L

0

dxN ···Z L

0

dx1 Deiσ PN

i=1 φ(xi)E , (2.4)

where in interchanging the average with the sum and the
integrals they use the linearity of the average. we haven’
t deﬁned the average yet so we will do it next.

III. AVERAGING OVER A GENERAL GAUSSIAN
RANDOM PROCESS

A general Gaussian random process φ(x) is deﬁned
by the postulate that for any ﬁnite number of points
x1, . . . , xN the joint probability density for φ(xk) in dφk
(we will often make use of the abbreviation φi ≡ φ(xi))
is of the form,

P (φ1, . . . , φN ) =

√det B
(2π)N/2 e− 1

2 PN

k=1 PN

l=1 Bklφkφl,(3.1)

where Bij = Bij (x1, . . . , xN ) are the elements of the pos-
itive deﬁnite matrix B.

Let αk be N arbitrary real numbers. Then,

Dei PN

i=1 αiφiE = e− 1

where C = B−1.

2 PN

k=1 PN

l=1 Cklαkαl,

(3.2)

Diﬀerentiating with respect to αk and αl (not excluding
k = l) and then setting all α to zero, one obtains,

hφ(xk)φ(xl)i = Ckl = C(xk, xl),

(3.3)

where C is a function of two variables only, called the
covariance function. From equations (3.2) and (3.3) fol-
lows that also Bij = B(xi, xj) is a function of just two
variables. The covariance completely characterizes the
statistical nature of φ(x)

Replacing all the α’s in equation (3.2) with σ and com-
paring (3.2) and (2.4) with (2.1) and (2.2) one recognizes
that,

C(x1, x2) =

2
θσ2 w(x1, x2).

(3.4)

This imposes a restriction to the systems that one can
treat. Namely we need w to be positive deﬁnite.

Why is all this useful is explained in the next section.

IV. KAC’S THEOREM

Consider a Markoﬃan process φ(x), i.e. one for which, given any increasing sequence of “times” x0, x1, . . . , xn, with

x0 ≤ x1 ≤ ··· ≤ xn, the probability density that φ(xk) is in dφk (with k = 0, 1, . . . , n) is the product,

P (φ1, . . . , φn) =Z ∞

−∞

n

Yk=1

P (φk, xk|φk−1, xk−1)R(φ0, x0)dφ0,

(4.1)

3

where P (φ1, x1|φ0, x0) is the conditional probability that φ(x1) is in an element dφ1 around φ1 given that φ(x0) = φ0
and R(φ, x) is the initial probability distribution for the process.4 Both the conditional probabilities and the initial
distribution are assumed to be normalized to unity over the interval φ ∈ [−∞, +∞],
dφ R(φ, x) = 1.

(4.2)

Z ∞

−∞

dφ1 P (φ1, x1|φ0, x0) =Z ∞

Any quantity which is an expression involving φ(x) is a random variable whose average value may be determined
using the probability (4.1).

One is interested in averages of the form,

W (x, x0) =DeR x

(4.3)

dx1 hF (φn, xn)··· F (φ1, x1)i.

Kac’s theorem takes advantage of the Markoﬃan property (4.1) to relate to each other the successive terms of this
series by an integral-recursion formula. It can be seen by inspection that,

Q =

Then one can write the following integral equation for Q,

dφ′ P (φ, x|φ′, x′)F (φ′, x′)Q(φ′, x′|φ0, x0). (4.5)

This is the main result of Kac’s theorem.

Now assuming that the stochastic process φ(x) satisﬁes

that Q satisﬁes,

a forward Fokker-Planck equation,

∂
∂x

P (φ, x|φ0, x0) = L(φ, x)P (φ, x|φ0, x0)

Q(φ, x|φ0, x0)

(4.7)

Q(φ, x0|φ0, x0) = R(φ, x0)

initial condition

it immediately follows from the integral formula (4.5),

If we now further assume φ(x) to be a Gaussian process
(so that equation (4.1) is of the form (3.1)) then we can

put together the result of the previous section (3.4) and
Kac’s theorem, to say that,

Ω = W (L, 0) =Z ∞

−∞

dφ Q(φ, L|0, 0) ,

(4.8)

where Q = Q(φ, x|φ0, x0) is the solution of the par-
tial diﬀerential equation (4.7) with F (φ, x) = F (φ) =
z exp(iσφ). This is the simpliﬁcation found by EL.

Note the following points:

• This certainly is a simpliﬁcation from a compu-
tational point of view and establishes a bridge
between non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and
the theory of stochastic processes and equilibrium
statistical mechanics in one dimension.

• When the operator L is independent of “time” (we
keep calling x time because it comes natural from
the notion of random process. In the present con-
text though x is the position of a particle along
his one dimensional world) then both P (φ, x|φ0, x0)
and Q(φ, x|φ0, x0) depend only on |x − x0| since F
does not depend explicitly on x.

• For a non-stationary random process φ(x) it is often
possible to choose a delta function as initial distri-
bution, i.e. R(φ, x0) = δ(φ−φ0), where φ0 = φ(x0).
In this case Q is the fundamental solution of the
partial diﬀerential equation (4.7).

• For a non-stationary random process the covariance
function C(x1, x2) = hφ(x1)φ(x2)i is not a function
of |x2 − x1| alone. The identiﬁcation of the covari-
ance with the pair-potential v demands that the
process be stationary because the pair-potential is
a function of the diﬀerence of the two position vari-
ables. But in some cases (due for example to the
presence of the reservoir) w may diﬀer from v (see
subsection V B).

As a ﬁnal remark, in EL is stressed the importance of
the Markoﬃan nature of the process. They observe that
the concept of a Markoﬃan process involves the idea of a
succession in “time” and this is meaningless when there
is more then one independent variable. So it seems to
be hard to extend the technique just described even to a
two dimensional system.

In the following section we will apply the functional
integration technique just described to some concrete ex-
ample.

V. EXAMPLES

dφ1 P (φ2, x2|φ1, x1)P (φ1, x1|φ0, x0).

(5.2)

Let us see now how all this works for two well known

Markoﬃan, Gaussian stochastic processes.

A. The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process

The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is a stationary pro-

cess deﬁned as follows,

R(φ0, x0) =

φ2
0
2

e−
√2π

,

(φ−φ0e−γ∆x)2

2S(∆x)

e−

P (φ, x|φ0, x0) =

with ∆x = |x − x0|,

p2πS(∆x)
S(∆x) = 1 − e−2γ∆x,

(5.3)

,

(5.4)

where γ is the inverse of the characteristic time constant
of the process, i.e. a positive real number.

The covariance for this process is,

C(x1, x2) = e−γ|x1−x2|.

(5.5)

The Fokker-Planck equation satisﬁed by the process
is the Smoluchowski diﬀusion equation for an harmonic
oscillator,

L(φ) = γ(cid:18) ∂2
∂φ2 +

∂
∂φ

φ(cid:19) .

(5.6)

So this process can be used to describe a system of

particles whose potential energy is,

w(x1, x2) =

θσ2
2

e−γ|x1−x2|.

(5.7)

Adding a hard-core part to this long range potential and
making it attractive by choosing σ pure imaginary, gives
the so called “Kac-Baker model”. Yang and Lee showed
that the presence of the hard core part is suﬃcient to
ensure the existence of the thermodynamic potential for
the inﬁnite system (L → ∞). This was calculated exactly
by Kac who also proved that the model has no phase
transitions (because of the inﬁnite range of the potential,
L. Van Hove’s proof is not applicable here). Later Baker
showed that if one sets,

σ = ir α0γ

θ

,

(5.8)

Note that due to the Markoﬃan nature of the stochas-
tic process the following two properties should be re-

(so that the integral of the potential is independent of γ)
and then takes the limit γ → 0 after the limit L → ∞,

then a phase transition of the classical Van der Waals
type is obtained. A model with exponential repulsive
pair-potential (exactly like the one in (5.7)) was studied
by D. S. Newman, who concluded that it did not show
phase transitions in the long range limit γ → 0.5

B. The Wiener process

We follow EL and introduce the Wiener process. It is

a non-stationary process deﬁned by (if x ≥ x0 > 0),

R(φ0, x0) =

P (φ, x|φ0, x0) =

φ2
0

4Dx0

e−
√4πDx0
e− ∆φ2
√4πD∆x

4D∆x

(5.9)

,

(5.10)

with ∆x = x − x0,
∆φ = φ − φ0,

where D is the diﬀusion constant of the Brownian pro-
cess, i.e. a positive real number.

The covariance for this process is,

C(x1, x2) = 2D min(x1, x2).

(5.11)

Although this process cannot be diﬀerentiated it can be
seen as the integral, φ(x) = R x
0 ds ξ(s), of the Gaussian
white noise process, ξ(x), deﬁned by hξ(x)i = 0 and
hξ(x1)ξ(x0)i = ζ2δ(x1 − x0) and the attribute Gaussian
implies that all cumulants higher than of second order
vanish. One just needs to set 2D = ζ2.

The Fokker-Planck equation satisﬁed by the process is

the Einstein diﬀusion equation,

L(φ) = D

∂2
∂φ2 .

(5.12)

So this process can be used to describe a system of

particles whose potential energy is,

w(x1, x2) = Dθσ2 min(x1, x2).

(5.13)

It was S. F. Edwards, see EL, who ﬁrst realized that this
is a Coulomb system: electrons of charge q living in the
segment [0, L] are in contact with an inﬁnite reservoir (in
the region x < 0, say). The reservoir exchanges particles
with the system of electrons giving rise to the statistical
ﬂuctuations in particle number. Take the system plus
reservoir electrically neutral as a whole and imagine the
system containing N electrons. Then there is a total
charge −N q in the reservoir. Gauss theorem then tells
that in the region x ≥ 0 there is a constant electric ﬁeld
of magnitude 2πN q, due to the presence of the reservoir.
Now choosing,

Which is readily recognized as the expected result for
the “Edwards’ model”. We are assuming that the line
is the real world in which each charge lives. So that
also its ﬁeld lines cannot escape from the line. Then
the electric potential of each charge is the solution of
d2ψ(x)/dx2 = −4πδ(x), i.e. ψ(x) = −2π|x|.
Note that due to the presence of the neutralizing reser-
voir, w is not just a function of |xi−xj| and consequently
the random process is not just a stationary one as in the
Kac-Baker example.

In this case Edwards has not been able to answer in a
deﬁnite way to the problem of continuity of the thermo-
dynamic functions.

VI. THERMODYNAMICS

Following EL, we want now comment brieﬂy on the
relevance of all this from the point of view of the ther-
modynamics of the system of particles. Given the grand
canonical partition function Ω = Ω(z, L, θ) the equation
of state follows from eliminating z between the two fol-
lowing equations,

P

ln Ω(z, L, θ),

n = z

ln Ω(z, L, θ).

(6.1)

(6.2)

where P is the pressure and n the number density of
particles. Sometimes one talks about chemical potential
µ (of the one-component system), instead of z. The two
are related by,

z =(cid:18) mθ

2π2(cid:19)1/2

eµ/θ > 0,

(6.3)

where m is the mass of the particles. All the other ther-
modynamic functions can be obtained from the internal
energy,

one can rewrite the total potential energy of the system
as,

(6.4)

where S is the entropy of the system. Or alternatively
from the Helmholtz free energy,

A(N, L, θ) = µN − θ ln Ω(z, L, θ).

(6.5)

It is often useful to simplify the problem by studying
just the asymptotic behavior of Ω in the inﬁnite system
limit L → ∞. This usually allows the recognition of
eventual phase transitions (as in the Yang and Lee theory
and L. Van Hove theorem) as singularities in the equation
of state. The equation of state for the inﬁnite system
becomes then,

VII. CHARACTERISTIC VALUE PROBLEM

Both the examples described have the common feature
that L is independent of time x. Under this circumstance
the problem of calculating the grand canonical partition
function Ω may be simpliﬁed even further, as shown in
EL.

Letting φ → φ/σ, the coeﬃcient function F (φ) in equa-
tion (4.7) is periodic with period 2π. It is then possible
to reduce the problem (4.7) to the characteristic value
problem of an ordinary diﬀerential operator on a ﬁnite
interval of the independent variable φ. Let,

˜Q(φ, x) =

∞

Xn=−∞

˜Q(φ, 0) =

∞

Xn=−∞

For the “Kac-Baker model” one ﬁnds for example
/√2πσ2, where
θ3 is an elliptical theta function6, and for the “Edwards’
n=−∞ δ(φ + 2πn). So, for this latter
case, ˜Q is the periodic fundamental solution of (4.7). It
then follows that,

˜Q(φ, 0) = θ3(cid:16)iπφ/σ2, e−2π2/σ2(cid:17) e−φ2/2σ2
model” ˜Q(φ, 0) =P∞

6

Then one looks for a complete orthonormal set of
eigenfunctions ym with relative eigenvalues λm (m =
0, 1, 2, . . .),

Z π

−π

dφ ym(φ)ym′ (φ) = δm,m′.

(7.5)

The expansion of ˜Q in terms of these functions is,

∞

˜Q(φ, x) =

Xm=0
Bm =Z π

−π

eλmxBmym(φ),

dφ ˜Q(φ, 0)ym(φ).

(7.6)

(7.7)

For example Bm = ym(0) for the “Edwards’ model”. The
grand partition function becomes,

∞

AmeλmL,

Ω(L) =

Xm=0
Am = BmZ π

−π

dφ ym(φ).

(7.8)

(7.9)

The λm and the ym depends parametrically on z which
enters into the deﬁnition of F (φ). Moreover since F (φ) =
F ∗(−φ) the λm are either real or occur in complex con-
jugate pairs.
Now assume that among the sequence of eigenvalue λm
there is one λ0 that is real and is bigger than the real part
of all the others then the following simpliﬁcation holds,

Ω(L → ∞) ∼ A0eλ0L .

(7.10)

The equation of state for the inﬁnite system then be-
comes,

n = lim

L→∞(cid:20)z

∂

∂z (cid:18) ln A0(z)

L

∂
∂z

λ0(z).

+ λ0(z)(cid:19)(cid:21)

(7.11)

(7.12)

For example for the ideal gas, σ → 0 and λ0(z) = az,
with a a constant.
Let us summarize the characteristic value problem for
the examples described. Denoting with a dash a ﬁrst
derivative respect to φ (. . .′ ≡ d . . . /dφ) we have:
(i) “Kac-Baker model” repulsive5,

γ[σ2y′′ + (φy)′] + zeiφy = λy,

(7.13)

Q(φ + 2πn, x|0, 0).

(7.1)

P = θλ0(z),

This function is the periodic solution of the partial dif-
ferential equation (4.7) and for x = 0 it reduces to,

R(φ + 2πn, 0).

(7.2)

= z

dφ ˜Q(φ, L).

(7.3)

(ii) “Edwards’ model”2,

Ω =Z π

−π

Since F and L do not depend on x, in solving (4.7) for ˜Q,
one may use the method of separation of variables. This
leads to the characteristic value problem,
[L(φ) + F (φ)] y(φ) = λy(φ),
y(φ + 2π) = y(φ).

(7.4)

2πq2

y′′ + zeiφy = λy,

this is the one component plasma or jellium system.

this is the two component plasma system of two kinds of
particles with charges ±q and the corresponding values
of z that by symmetry may be assumed equal without
loss of generality.

In all cases y(φ) is a function of period 2π (for the
attractive Kac-Baker model the periodicity is lost but
the characteristic value problem is still valid).

Unfortunately there is no simple way to solve explicitly
Eq. (7.13) for the Kac-Baker model. Nonetheless it is
apparent the existence of the thermodynamic limit for
the repulsive model, as was proved by D. S. Newman8.

In the Edwards’ model the presence of the neutralizing
reservoir is responsible (the potential energy of interac-
tion between the particles and the reservoir being pro-
portional to +x) for the charges all of the same sign to
accumulate at the origin resulting in a system with zero
density and pressure in accord with the fact that Eq.
(7.14) admits solutions in terms of modiﬁed Bessel func-

tions of the ﬁrst kind I±i√2θλ/πq2 (p2θzeiφ/πq2) which
form a complete set for λ = −m2 with m = 0, 1, 2, . . ., so
that λ0 = 0.
In the Lenard’s model the solutions of Eq. (7.15) is in
terms of even and odd Mathieu functions with charac-
teristic value a = −2λθ/πq2, parameter q = −2θz/πq2,
and argument φ/2. According to Floquet’s theorem, any
Mathieu function of argument φ can be written in the
form eirφf (φ), where f has period 2π and r is the Math-
ieu characteristic exponent. For nonzero q the Mathieu
functions are only periodic for certain values of a. Such
Mathieu characteristic values are given by ar = A(r, q)
with r integer or rational and A(0, q) ≤ A(r, q) for all
r, q. Then we will have λ0 = −(πq2/2θ)A(0,−2θz/πq2).
In Fig. 1 we show the equation of state of the Lenard
model at various temperatures θ for q = 1. We are then

VIII. A NON PAIRWISE-ADDITIVE PENETRABLE
INTERACTION MODEL

In the examples described we started from known
stochastic processes to ﬁnd which physical ﬂuid model
they may be able to describe. Actually one wants to
do the reverse: given a physical model, i.e. given w (a
positive deﬁnite function (3.4)), determine the stochas-
tic process that allows the desired simpliﬁcation for the
grand canonical partition function.

In the more general case one has to deal with w’s which
are not functions of the pair-potential alone, as happened
in the case of Edwards’ model. For example one may be
interested in modifying Edwards’ model for the case of a
Coulomb system moving but not living in [0, L] with ﬁeld
lines allowed to exit the segment and interacting with the
full three dimensional pair-potential v(x) = 1/√x2 + ε2,
with ε a small positive quantity so that v0 = 1/ǫ or
σ = 2/√εθ. A neutralizing uniform background in this
case gives rise to quadratic terms making even the one-
component system stable. To obtain the purely one di-
mensional case it is necessary to take the ε → 0 limit at
the end of the analysis of the quasi one dimensional case.
This problem has been solved by R. J. Baxter5 who de-
veloped a method for ﬁnding the partition function when
the pair-potential satisﬁes a linear diﬀerential equation
with constant coeﬃcients. His method still leads to an
eigenvalue problem but does not employ functional aver-
aging.

As a progress in this direction it is useful to reconsider
the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process in a more general way.
Consider the following stationary stochastic process,

R(φ0, x0) =

φ2

,

e−
√2π
e− (φ−φ0 A(∆x))2
p2πS(∆x)
S(∆x) = 1 − A2(∆x),

2S(∆x)

with ∆x = |x − x0|,

P (φ, x|φ0, x0) =

(8.1)

,

(8.2)

where the last deﬁnition assures the validity of the
Markoﬃan property (5.1). Clearly,
in order to sat-
isfy the Markoﬃan property (5.2) we need to require
A(x)A(y) = A(x + y) which is only satisﬁed by choos-
ing A as an exponential as in the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
process. Here we willingly violate this second property
and choose A as an arbitrary function. In order to have
P (φ, x0|φ0, x0) = δ(φ − φ0) we must also require that
limx→0 A(x) = 1.

The covariance for this process is,

C(xi, xj) =

2
θσ2 w(xi, xj ) =

j−1

Yk=i

A(|xk − xk+1|),(8.3)

with xi ≤ xi+1 ≤ xi+2 ≤ . . . ≤ xj . So the interac-
tion between particle i and particle j depends on how

many particles lie between them. This is a particular
non pairwise-additive interaction model.

It can be readily veriﬁed that the transition density of
this process satisﬁes the following forward Fokker-Planck
equation,

L(φ, x) = −

(8.4)

where the dot denotes diﬀerentiation with respect to
time ( ˙. . . ≡ d . . . /dx). All the properties of section
IV continue to hold. Then, calling v = Aθσ2/4 with
v(0) = v0 = θσ2/4, i.e penetrable particles, we can sim-
plify the thermodynamics of a ﬂuid with the following

and
B2(x) = 4γx. For this model we expect that the attrac-
tive, σ2 = 4v0/θ < 0, case is thermodynamically unstable
in agreement with the fact that the particles will tend to
collapse at a same point since the system is not H-stable
in the sense of Ruelle10. On the other hand we do not
know anything yet about the repulsive, σ2 > 0, case,
which is H-stable and therefore we must have P/θ < z.
For example, we know that there cannot be any conden-
sation but an interesting question is whether there can
be freezing11.

The problem (4.7) becomes

for a conﬁguration with x1 ≤ x2 ≤ x3 ≤ . . . ≤ xN .
Unfortunately in this case we cannot use the method
of separation of variables described in section VII since
L is time dependent.
Introducing the function B2(x) = −2d ln A(x)/dx
one can then say that according to Ito or Stratonovich
calculus9 the process deﬁned by Eqs. (8.1)-(8.2) satisﬁes
the following stochastic diﬀerential equation,

˙φ(x) = −

where ξ(x) is Gaussian white noise with ζ = 1. The

A. Example: A non pairwise-additive Gaussian model

For example we want to simplify the non pairwise-
additive interaction model ﬂuid of the previous section,

Clearly, approximating F (φ) ≈ z or, equivalently, set-
ting σ → 0, we get the ideal gas behavior. In fact the
solution to Eq. (8.7) is, in this simple case, Q(φ, x|0, 0) =
P (φ, x|0, 0)ezx, since ∂P/∂x = LP . So that from Eqs.
(4.8) and (4.2) immediately follows Ω = ezL.

In order to make some progress towards the solution of the full Eq. (8.7) we deﬁne L ≡ xR and H(x) = xR + F .

Since H at diﬀerent times do not commute we use the following Dyson series

Q(φ, x|0, 0) = U(x, 0)R(φ, 0),

First of all notice that, if the thermodynamic limit exists, we must have P = O(z2/γ, σ2)zθ with O a given function
of two variables such that limσ→0 O(a, σ2) = 1. Note that when there is no interaction between the particles v0 → 0
and/or at very high temperature θ → ∞, then σ → 0 and we end up with an ideal gas.
Then, if it was hk = 1 we would immediately ﬁnd the ideal gas behavior. On the other hand if it was gk = 1 we
would ﬁnd an unstable system for v0 < 0 and a stable system with P = 0 = n for v0 > 0 since

i=1(−1)m+idk+m,k,i ψi and dk+m,k,i some positive coeﬃcients. So that of course hk(0, η) = 1 for all

Then we can easily re-sum the series of Eq. (8.17) to say

pose ﬁrst that we had found for lk,i,

We could then immediately say that the attractive, σ2 <

series in Eq.
(8.28) would be not summable, whereas
the repulsive, σ2 > 0, case would be stable. In this latter
case O = limL→∞ ln ΩL/L would be ﬁnite and the system
would admit a well deﬁned thermodynamic limit without
phase transitions. The equation of state would be

so that P = O(n2/γ, v0/θ)nθ and for small n one would
have P ≈ nθ.
In order to make some progress towards the exact so-
lution we can then write dn,k,i = dn,k,1En,k,i and note
that En,k,1 = 1 and by inspection E2+i,2,i = 1. Now if
we had En,k,i = 1 for all n, k, i then we would get

This is a signal that our approximation is too brute.

In the appendix we report the ﬁrst few exact En,k,i.
Even if we found it too hard to guess the full analytic
expression from the ﬁrst few of them, the results of the
appendix can be used to reﬁne our analysis.

Note that the dependence of Ek+m,k,i on k is crucial be-

added to the H-stability condition P/θ < z, would be
enough to say that the repulsive Gaussian core model
only admits a zero pressure zero density state. Note also
that the dependence of En,k,i on i is also crucial because
otherwise for σ = 1 the argument of the ﬁrst two se-
ries would be symmetric under exchange of i and l which
would mean that the two models with γ > 0 and with
γ < 0 would have the same thermodynamics which is
clearly absurd12.

The ﬁrst alternating series has very slow numerical
convergence as L grows. We then found it diﬃcult to
extract even a numerical equation of state. Nonetheless
we found that the triple series is convergent at least in
the high temperature regime, 0 < σ2 ≪ 1.

In view of the H-stability upper bound of Eq. (8.38), Mk
should be decaying as 1/L4 or faster, at large L.
If it
decays faster, then Gk is independent of k and the only
possible state is a zero pressure one. If it decays as 1/L4,
from the results of the appendix we can say that it does
not increase with k and again the zero pressure state is
the only one possible in the thermodynamic limit. So,
in the end, we were unable to ﬁnd a regular thermody-
namics even for the repulsive stable case with positive γ.
Everything is pointing towards a zero pressure state in
the thermodynamic limit. This would be in agreement
with the observation that as θ → 0 the only conﬁgura-
(2.1) are the
tions contributing to the integral in Eq.
ones with minimum VN − µN which are those where the
particles are inﬁnitely spaced one another with n → 0.

B. Observation

Now, we can observe that applying the previous anal-
ysis to the pairwise-additive Kac-Baker model, v(x) =
v0e−γ|x|, γ > 0, the structure of the solution for the par-
tition function reads

initely say that the attractive model is thermodynami-
cally unstable. But we know that the repulsive case is a
pairwise-additive interaction model with a regular ther-
modynamics.

IX. CONCLUSIONS

We reviewed, under the uniﬁed setting of functional
integration in one dimension, some of the exactly solv-
able one dimensional continuum ﬂuid models of equilib-
rium classical statistical mechanics. Following the origi-
nal idea of Marc Kac we write the partition function of
each model as a path integral over particular Markoﬃan,
Gaussian stochastic processes. Following the idea of Sam
Edwards we further reduce the thermodynamic problem

11

for such ﬂuids to the solution of a second order ordinary
diﬀerential equation, the characteristic value problem.

In the work of Edwards and Lenard2 it is also given
a detailed analysis of how one can extend this method
to get solutions for the pair- and higher orders static
correlation functions.

We propose a generalization of the method which al-
lows to treat other models with a non pairwise-additive
interaction between the constituent penetrable particles
of the ﬂuid. The characteristic value problem of Edwards
cannot be used anymore but the simpliﬁcation of Kac re-
mains valid. We apply this further developments to the
simple case of the Gaussian core ﬂuid model for which
we prove that the attractive system is thermodynami-
cally unstable, in agreement with the fact that it is not
H-stable in the sense of Ruelle10, and ﬁnd an approxi-
mate expression for the exact partition function in terms
of a triple series one of which is alternating. We were
unable to ﬁnd a well deﬁned thermodynamics even for
the repulsive system. Everything suggest that the only
admitted state in the thermodynamic limit is the zero
pressure one.

Appendix A: The coeﬃcients En,k,i

In table I we list the ﬁrst exact En,k,i coeﬃcients for

i = 2, 3, 4 and the ﬁrst seven n.

From the table we can see how there is a very weak
dependence on k. So we can on a ﬁrst ground assume that
En,k,i ≈ En,2,i = en−i,i for all k. Moreover the entries of
the table satisfy the following recurrence relation

(A1)

e2,i = 1,
ej,2 = 2j−1 − 1,
ej,i = iej−1,i + ej,i−1,

(A2)
(A3)
with j = n − i. So that introducing the generating func-
tion ϕ(x, i) =P∞

j=2 ej,ixj we easily ﬁnd
ϕ(x, 2) = x2/(x − 1)(2x − 1),
ϕ(x, i)/x = iϕ(x, i) + ϕ(x, i − 1)/x,

(A4)
(A5)

with solution

x3

ϕ(x, i) =

,

(A6)

(x − 1)(−x)i(2 − 1/x)i−1

with (a)i = a(a + 1)··· (a + i − 1) = Γ(a + i)/Γ(a) the
Pochhammer symbol. The desired coeﬃcient ej,i is the
j-th coeﬃcient in the series expansion of ϕ(x, i) around
x = 0.

More precisely we can then write En,k,i = hn,k,ien−i,i
with hn,2,i = 1 and E2+i,2,i = 1. We can also observe
that En,k,i tends to decrease with k at ﬁxed n and i.
