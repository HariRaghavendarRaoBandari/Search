Disordered quantum networks, as those describing light-harvesting complexes, are often charac-
terized by the presence of peripheral ring-like structures, where the excitation is initialized, and
inner structures, reaction centers (RC), where the excitation is trapped and transferred. The pe-
ripheral rings often display distinguished coherent features: their eigenstates can be separated, with
respect to the transfer of excitation, in the two classes of superradiant and subradiant states. Both
are important to optimize transfer eﬃciency. In the absence of disorder, superradiant states have
an enhanced coupling strength to the RC, while the subradiant ones are basically decoupled from
it. Static on-site disorder induces a coupling between subradiant and superradiant states, thus cre-
ating an indirect coupling to the RC. The problem of ﬁnding the optimal transfer conditions, as
a function of both the RC energy and the disorder strength, is very complex even in the simplest
network, namely a three-level system. In this paper we analyze such trimeric structure choosing
as initial condition an excitation on a subradiant state, rather than the more common choice of an
excitation localized on a single site. We show that, while the optimal disorder is of the order of the
superradiant coupling, the optimal detuning between the initial state and the RC energy strongly
depends on system parameters: when the superradiant coupling is much larger than the energy gap
between the superradiant and the subradiant levels, optimal transfer occurs if the RC energy is at
resonance with the subradiant initial state, whereas we ﬁnd an optimal RC energy at resonance
with a virtual dressed state when the superradiant coupling is smaller than or comparable with
the gap. The presence of dynamical noise, which induces dephasing and decoherence, aﬀects the
resonance structure of energy transfer producing an additional “incoherent” resonance peak, which
corresponds to the RC energy being equal to the energy of the superradiant state.

INTRODUCTION

Photosynthetic bacteria utilize antenna complexes to
capture photons and convert the energy of the short-
lived electronic excitation in a more stable form, such
as chemical bonds. After absorption, the energy is trans-
ferred to a complex, called reaction center (RC), where
it initiates electron transfer, resulting in a membrane po-
tential. This very eﬃcient transfer occurs on a time-
scale of few hundreds of picoseconds and on a length-
scale of few nanometers, so that coherent quantum dy-
namics can enter the play, as recent experiments seem
to prove [1]. Quantum coherence can enhance trans-
port eﬃciency inducing Supertransfer and Superradiance
in light-harvesting complexes [2–4]. On the other hand,
quantum coherence can also be detrimental to transport,
as Anderson localization [5] and the presence of trapping-
free subspaces [6] show.

Superradiance [7–9], as viewed in the context of both
optical ﬂuorescence [10–12] and quantum transport in
open systems [2, 13–16], is not solely a many-body eﬀect.
Single-excitation superradiance is a prominent example

∗ giulio.giusteri@oist.jp

of genuinely quantum cooperative eﬀect [17], relevant in
natural complexes, which operate in the single excitation
regime since solar light is very dilute.

Natural complexes are subject to a noisy environment
with diﬀerent correlation time-scales (if compared to the
excitonic transport time):
(i) short-time correlations,
giving rise to dephasing (homogeneous broadening, as
considered e.g. in [18–21]) and (ii) long-time correlations,
producing on-site static disorder (inhomogeneous broad-
ening, as considered e.g. in [22, 23]). Following a com-
mon nomenclature, we will refer to the former eﬀect as
dephasing noise and to the latter as static disorder.

The role of environment is twofold: on one hand, it
can help transport since it destroys the detrimental co-
herent eﬀects, leading to noise-enhanced energy transfer,
i.e. the existence of a maximal eﬃciency at some interme-
diate noise strength, as found in the last decade by vari-
ous groups [6, 18–21, 24–30]. On the other hand, it can
suppress the beneﬁcial coherences leading to a quenching
of Supertransfer [15]. It is thus essential to consider this
non-trivial interplay.

Typical structures of bacterial photosynthetic com-
plexes display a RC placed at the center of the light-
harvesting complex I (LHI), with the chromophores ar-
ranged on a ring and surrounded by other ring structures
(called LHII) acting as peripheral antennae. The LHI-RC

structure describing light-harvesting complexes produces
a distinguished feature: the eigenstates of the peripheral
ring structure can be separated into two classes, superra-
diant and subradiant states, with respect to the transfer
of excitation towards the RC. In absence of both environ-
mental noise and static disorder, the superradiant states
are coupled to the RC with a coupling amplitude propor-
tional to √N , where N is the number of chromophores
in the ring, while subradiant states are basically decou-
pled from the RC. In presence of disorder, the subradiant
states can be coupled to the superradiant ones and, as
a consequence, only indirectly coupled to the RC states.
Note that the subradiant subspace, previously studied by
the authors [15], has been also analyzed in the literature
under the name of trapping-free subspace [6].

The optimization of excitation transfer eﬃciency from
peripheral states in networks displaying the Ring-RC
structure is a rather diﬃcult problem, even for a network
as simple as a trimer. Despite its simplicity, the trimer
model has been discussed in several papers as a paradig-
matic model [18, 31]. In particular, in [18] various opti-
mal conditions are explored in simple few-site networks in
the presence of dephasing noise but without static disor-
der. Since it is diﬃcult to clarify generic physical eﬀects
by studying speciﬁc natural systems, we rather investi-
gate the simplest model for quantum transport that dis-
plays the features mentioned above: a disordered trimer
with a superradiant and a subradiant state, on which the
excitation is initialized, along with an acceptor state (the
RC), where the excitation can be trapped, see Fig. 1a.
We believe this to be an essential step towards under-
standing the basic mechanism of transfer optimization in
more complex networks.

Here we discuss the optimization of excitation transfer
eﬃciency when the excitation is initially prepared on a
subradiant state rather than on a single site, as is usu-
ally done. There are two main reasons for considering
transport from a subradiant initial condition, related to
the presence of noise and disorder: (i) The thermaliza-
tion processes, typically at place in natural complexes,
such as the LHI-RC of purple bacteria, tend to populate
the lowest-energy levels, which include both superradi-
ant and subradiant states with respect to the RC and to
the electromagnetic ﬁeld [15, 32]. (ii) In absence of any
noise, subradiant states do not contribute to transport
eﬃciency. The presence of moderate static disorder hin-
ders super- and sub-radiance, causing subradiant states
to become signiﬁcantly open to transport. Hence, a mod-
erate disorder increases the transport eﬃciency of subra-
diant states. At the same time, a very large disorder
ultimately prevents transport, due to Anderson localiza-
tion. Since disorder is only detrimental for superradiant
states, the overall optimization of transfer is determined
by the behavior of subradiant states.

To pursue our goal, in Section II we present our trimer

model.

absence of disorder, while the subradiant state is decou-

the trimer model is shown in the superradiant-subradiant-RC
basis, see text.

pled from the RC, the superradiant state has an enhanced
coupling Vrc to the RC. We discuss the maximization of
the average (over disorder) transfer eﬃciency with re-
spect to both the detuning δErc between initial subradi-
ant state and RC and the strength W of disorder. We
have found two diﬀerent regimes depending on Vrc and
the energy gap ∆ between the subradiant and superra-
diant states. The optimal detuning is achieved when the
energy of the RC is at resonance with the initial state
(subradiant) for Vrc (cid:29) ∆, while we have found a less
trivial optimal detuning, namely δErc = V 2
rc/∆, in the
case Vrc ≤ ∆. This can be interpreted as a resonant con-
dition between dressed states. Concerning the optimal
disorder, we have found that it is always of the order
of Vrc, if Vrc is larger or comparable with ∆, while it is
smaller when Vrc (cid:28) ∆.

We analyze in Section III how our ﬁndings are af-
fected by dephasing. Since our aim is to analyze in de-
tail a very simpliﬁed model, we include in a paradigmatic
way the eﬀects of a dephasing environment, adopting the
Haken–Strobl model [33]. Such an eﬀective master equa-
tion assumes white-noise ﬂuctuations of the site energies,
thereby implying a high-temperature limit. Even if it is
possible to consider more reﬁned phononic baths, they
are not necessary here due to the simplicity of our model.
Moreover, they have been found to give results that are
qualitatively similar to those obtained with the Haken–
Strobl approach [2–4].

We show that dynamical noise induces an additional
resonance peak when the RC energy is equal to the energy
of the superradiant state.
Indeed, the incoherent path
opened by dephasing favours transport between those
states which are directly coupled, making the ﬁnal hop-
ping between the superradiant state and the RC the key
passage of the transport process. By contrast, the co-
herent resonance condition found in the absence of de-
phasing takes into account the interference eﬀects which
are present in the system as a whole, emphasizing the
role of the initial condition in determining the transport
eﬃciency.

where the action of the environment (static disorder) has
been taken into account by choosing the energy levels
Ek, k = 1, 2, as Gaussian random numbers with mean
zero and variance W 2, and no disorder has been added
to the RC site (its eﬀect can be naturally embedded as
additional disorder on the sites 1 and 2).

The loss of excitation through the RC has been de-
scribed by the non-Hermitian term −iκ/2. Throughout
the whole paper, κ is assumed to be small with respect
to the other coupling parameters. This choice is consis-
tent with the realistic photosynthetic models. In order
to make a close comparison with realistic systems and
following a standard procedure [2, 3, 14–16], we also in-
troduced the diagonal non-Hermitian terms −iΓﬂ/2, with
the ﬂuorescence constant Γﬂ much smaller than any other
energy scale (Ω, Ωrc, W, κ), representing the loss of exci-
tation from each site due to recombination.

It is convenient to move from the site-basis to the
subradiant-superradiant-RC basis by deﬁning the states

|SR (cid:105) =

from which the new Hamiltonian H easily follows (see

where the two Gaussian random variables x = (E1 −
E2)/2 and y = Erc − (E1 + E2)/2 are such that (cid:104)x(cid:105) = 0,
(cid:104)y(cid:105) = Erc, and (cid:104)x2(cid:105) = (cid:104)y2(cid:105) − E2
In this basis, the coupling between the subradiant state
and the RC vanishes, whereas the coupling between the
superradiant state and the RC is enhanced and it is
given by the matrix element Vrc = √2Ωrc. The struc-
ture of the Hamiltonian, depicted in Fig. 1b,
implies
that the excitation transfer from the subradiant state
to the RC can only be mediated by the superradiant
state, through the random coupling x. In this basis, the
trimer model subradiant-superradiant-RC corresponds to
a donor-bridge-acceptor (DBA) system without direct

3

coupling between the donor and the acceptor and with a
random coupling between donor and bridge and a random
acceptor energy. In spite of the fact that similar systems
have been widely studied in literature, the analysis devel-
oped in the present article concerning the optimization of
the decay of an excitation, initialized on the donor state
and dissipated at the level of the acceptor state, with the
stochastic terms considered here, appears to be new, to
the best of our knowledge. More importantly, our analy-
sis lies outside the regime of validity of perturbation the-
ory, which is used within the superexchange mechanism
[34] to study these systems. Indeed, the superexchange
mechanism can be applied only when the donor–bridge
coupling is much smaller than the donor–bridge energy
detuning (in our case this detuning can be even zero).

A most important quantity for such an analysis (moti-
vated by the study of light-harvesting complexes but also
relevant in a general context) is the eﬃciency, at the time
t, of energy transfer from the system into the RC. Given
an initial state |Ψin (cid:105), it is deﬁned as [19, 20]

and it represents the probability of escaping out of the
system up to the time t.
In the above deﬁnition the
brackets (cid:104). . .(cid:105)W indicate the average over disorder.
In numerical simulations we always consider the ef-
ﬁciency at a time t (cid:38) /Γﬂ. Note that the eﬃciency
strongly depends on the time t at which it is computed
for t < /Γﬂ, while it reaches a stable asymptotic value
η∞ for t (cid:38) /Γﬂ, thus motivating our choice. As Γﬂ → 0,
the asymptotic value of the eﬃciency is η∞ = 1 for any
choice of parameters. According to a common practice
in the study of light-harvesting systems, we will measure
energies in cm−1 and times in ps.

It is clear from (3) that the energy transfer eﬃciency is
strongly dependent upon the initial state, a feature also
studied in [23]. Indeed, if we start from the superradiant
state we are in a situation in which there is an enhanced
direct coupling to the RC at zero disorder. Thus, one
might think that the best situation occurs when the ex-
citation is on the superradiant state set at resonance with
the energy of the RC. In this situation disorder is only
detrimental to transport, since it tends to destroy the
superradiant coupling [10, 15] and it moves the system
out of resonance. On the other side, the excitation in
natural complexes is usually spread also on subradiant
states, due to the presence of a thermal bath. Since a
subradiant state is not directly coupled to the RC, it is
only through the action of disorder that the excitation
can be transferred from the initial state to the RC (i.e.
for W = 0, we have η = 0).

We will focus our attention on this non-trivial case
(see Fig. 1b), in which an initial excitation is on the sub-
radiant state at energy Ein = −Ω, coupled via x to the
superradiant state at energy Esr = Ω = Ein + ∆, which is
further coupled to the RC with the tunnelling amplitude

Vrc = √2Ωrc. Our aim is to ﬁnd the system conﬁgura-

ing the energy gap ∆ = 2Ω between the superradiant and
the subradiant states and the superradiant-RC coupling
Vrc, and assuming κ and Γﬂ to be perturbative quanti-
ties, we are left with two independent parameters to be
tuned to achieve the maximal eﬃciency: the subradiant-
RC detuning δErc = Erc− Ein and the strength W of the
random coupling x.
To pursue our goal we will ﬁrst analyze a fully deter-
ministic model obtained replacing the stochastic terms x
and y in equation (2) with deterministic parameters X
and Erc as follows:

(4)
In what follows, we analyze the results of the determin-
istic model comparing them with the results in presence
of disorder. In ﬁgures 2, 4, and 5 the results of the deter-
ministic model are shown in the left panels, while those
in presence of disorder, are in the right panels.

A. Optimal disorder and resonance conditions

According to our previous assumptions, the behavior
of the eﬃciency η in both the (X, δErc) and (W, δErc)
planes depends on the ratio between the two system pa-
rameters ∆ and Vrc. We ﬁrst consider the case ∆ = 0,
which corresponds to two uncoupled sites in the trimer
model (Ω = 0) equally connected to the RC. In this case,
the sole energy scale of the system is Vrc. We will subse-
quently consider the eﬀects of a ﬁnite gap ∆ (cid:54)= 0.
We observe that in most of the regimes we consider
here, where ∆ is very small compared to other param-
eters, we cannot rely on the superexchange interaction
approach (very eﬀective in other treatment of similar sys-
tems where a donor and an acceptor are not directly cou-
pled, see for instance [34]) to ﬁnd optimality conditions,
since the perturbative assumptions used there are not
generically valid in our context.

identifying the following global optimization condition:

Xopt = Vrc

and

δEopt

rc = 0 .

(5)

The estimate given in (5), obtained considering the co-
herent transfer of excitation between the subradiant and
the RC states, is a very good estimate also of the global
optimum of the transfer eﬃciency, as shown in Fig. 2
(blue cross in panel (a)). We observe that the condition
δErc = 0 is not necessary for the probability of being on
the RC to reach 1, but, in combination with X = Vrc, it
makes such transfer the fastest.

On the other hand, if we have some constraint on the
coupling X enforcing the condition X (cid:29) Vrc, the optimal
detuning is not given by δErc = 0. To ﬁnd the detuning
producing the optimal transfer in the case X (cid:29) Vrc we
can consider Vrc as a perturbation, obtaining the picture
illustrated in panel (a) of Fig. 3. The subradiant and
superradiant states couple and give rise to the dressed

which reduce to ε±(X) = Ein ± X for ∆ = 0 (recall that
we considered both κ and Γﬂ as small perturbations, that
can be neglected in ﬁnding the dressed energies). The
initial excitation is equally distributed on those levels,
and we can then identify two optimal detuning values by
the symmetric resonant tunneling conditions

(8)

In our case, since ∆ = 0, we have δErc(X) = ±X (see
dashed curves in Fig. 2). Note that in (8) we kept the
dependence on ∆, since it will be relevant to what follows.
As can be clearly seen from Fig. 2, the results obtained
from the deterministic model are in good agreement with
those in presence of disorder. Indeed, we can obtain an
excellent estimate for the global optimization condition
by simply substituting the deterministic coupling X with
W/√2 in (5) (blue cross panel (b) of Fig. 2).

1. The zero-gap case: ∆ = 0.

2. The ﬁnite-gap case I: Vrc (cid:29) ∆.

With ∆ = 0 our model corresponds to a tight-binding
chain of three sites, the ﬁrst (subradiant) is coupled via
X to the second (superradiant), with equal energy, which
is coupled to the RC with strength Vrc. It can be easily
checked that, if we initially excite the subradiant state,
the probability PRC(t) of ﬁnding the excitation on the
RC (which is a periodic function of time if we neglect the
non-Hermitian terms in (4)) can reach the maximal value
of 1 in the shortest time when X = Vrc and δErc = 0, thus

We now investigate whether the optimal conditions
given in equation (5) are valid also for ﬁnite values of
the energy gap ∆.

Let us ﬁrst consider the situation where ∆ < Vrc. We
see from Fig. 4 that the global optimization condition (5)
(blue cross) is still an excellent estimate for the conﬁg-
uration with maximal eﬃciency, and also the symmetric
resonances present for X (cid:29) Vrc follow the analytic pre-
diction (8) (see dashed curves in Fig. 4). Nevertheless,

2. The blue cross indicates the estimate (5) for the
optimal transfer conditions. The dashed curves indicate the resonances determined in (8). The values of the parameters are
∆ = 0 cm−1, Vrc = 1 cm−1, κ = 0.01 cm−1, and Γﬂ = 10−4 cm−1. We sampled the eﬃciency on a 100 × 100 uniform grid in
panel (a) and on a 100 × 200 uniform grid in panel (b), where the ensemble average over 2000 realizations of static disorder is
shown.

Fig. 4 enlightens a somewhat unexpected feature: if we
assume now the coupling X to be constrained within the
region X (cid:28) ∆ < Vrc, the RC energy producing the max-
imal eﬃciency, identiﬁed by a sharp resonance, is very
far from either Ein or ε±.

To understand such a resonance, we can now consider
X as a small perturbation, exploiting the picture illus-
trated in panel (b) of Fig. 3. The superradiant and the
RC states couple to give the dressed energy levels

which clearly depend on the RC energy Erc. The initial
excitation is all on the subradiant state, since X is small,
and a resonant tunneling criterion would now require Ein
to match the energies λ± of the superradiant-RC subsys-
tem. Nevertheless, we have Ein < Ein + ∆ < λ+ by
construction, so that the resonant condition for X (cid:28)

We sampled the eﬃciency on a 100× 300 uniform grid in both panels. In panel (b) the ensemble average over 2000 realizations
of static disorder is shown.

Concerning the model in presence of disorder, we can
again obtain an excellent estimate for the global opti-
mization condition by simply substituting the determin-
istic coupling X with W/√2 in (5) (blue cross in panel
(b) of Fig. 4).

3. The ﬁnite-gap case II: Vrc (cid:46) ∆.

If we now decrease further the ratio Vrc/∆ we ﬁnd the
following remarkable result (panel (a) of Fig. 5): the es-
timate (5), which was obtained for Vrc (cid:29) ∆, still identi-
ﬁes the global eﬃciency optimization in the deterministic
model (blue cross). Moreover, the resonances predicted
by (8) for X (cid:29) Vrc, ∆ and by (11) for X (cid:28) Vrc, ∆ still
correspond to the local optimization of the eﬃciency (see
white curves in Fig. 5). As for the model in presence of
disorder (panel (b) of Fig. 5), while the estimate (5) is
still within a region of signiﬁcant eﬃciency, the optimal
condition is modiﬁed by disorder, (see panels (c) and (d)
of Fig. 5 and the discussion below).
Indeed, when Vrc (cid:46) ∆ (Figure 5), disorder induces
some modiﬁcation of the global optimization conditions.
This eﬀect can be clearly seen by comparing panels
(c) and (d) of Fig. 5, which describe a situation with
Vrc/∆ ≈ 0.5. The average over disorder shifts the op-
timal detuning from δErc = 0 to the low-disorder reso-
nance δErc = V 2
rc/∆ given by (11). This can be explained
by the fact that the random coupling falls for many real-
izations in the region X < Vrc (cid:46) ∆, where the resonance

is for δErc = V 2
rc/∆ and not for δErc = 0. As far as op-
timal disorder is concerned, even if (5) overestimates its
actual value, it still gives an estimate within 5% of the
maximal eﬃciency (panel (d) of Fig. 5). In general for
Vrc (cid:28) ∆ we have veriﬁed that the optimal detuning is
still given by δErc = V 2
rc/∆, while the optimal disorder
shifts towards zero as Vrc decreases. This is again an ef-
fect of the average over disorder realizations, due to the
fact that the resonance condition δErc = V 2
rc/∆ is valid
for small disorder.

B. Summary for the case with only static disorder

Summarizing, the global optimization of the average
transfer eﬃciency η(t (cid:38) /Γﬂ) from the subradiant state
of the trimer into the sink placed at the RC is given by

Wopt/√2 (cid:39) Vrc

Another physically relevant question concerns the opti-
mal detuning at some ﬁxed disorder strength determined
by physiological conditions (natural systems are usually
subject to a deﬁnite range of static disorder).
In this
situation our results indicate that, if the disorder is con-
strained to be smaller than the energy gap ∆ and the

eﬃciency. The values of the parameters are ∆ = 20 cm−1, Vrc = 10 cm−1, κ = 0.01 cm−1, and Γﬂ = 10−4 cm−1. We sampled
the eﬃciency on a 100 × 600 uniform grid in panels (a) and (b) and on a 60 × 100 uniform grid in panels (c) and (d). In panels

zero, but it is always given by

(14)

with a signiﬁcant eﬃciency present only in a narrow band
around such optimal detuning. This result is at variance
with the intuitive expectation that the best transport
would be obtained at resonance with the initial state,
δErc = 0.

For large values of the static disorder, as a result of
the averaging procedure, we have a broad resonance cen-

tered around δErc = 0, which fades into two very broad
resonances centered around Erc = ε±(W/√2) given by
condition (7), characterized by a negligible eﬃciency.

III. THE EFFECT OF DEPHASING NOISE

We now discuss how the presence of dynamical noise
aﬀects the coherent features analyzed in the previous
section. The coupling to a dephasing environment is
modeled as stochastic ﬂuctuations of diagonal energies,
by adding to the Hamiltonian of the system the time-

with γφ/ being the dephasing rate. For the sake of com-
parison with the other system parameters, we represent
the intensity of dephasing by the energy parameter γφ.

This is a common way to include dephasing in exci-
ton dynamics, and it gives rise to the Haken–Strobl mas-
ter equation [33]. The Haken–Strobl approach has been
widely used in the past to include dephasing [10, 35]
and it has also been analyzed in many recent applica-
tions [16, 18–21, 24–30] for its simplicity and eﬀectiveness
in describing strong dephasing in the high-temperature
limit.

Within this approach, it is possible to analytically per-
form the average over white noise and then consider the
evolution of our trimer system as dictated by the fol-
lowing master equation for the average density matrix ρ
(h, k = 1, 2, 3 with 3 = RC):

where H is the non-Hermitian trimer Hamiltonian intro-
duced in (1), which contains the time-independent ran-
dom energies describing static disorder.

From the practical point of view, due to the low di-
mensionality of our model system, we can adopt a very
eﬀective computational strategy. Since Eq. (16) is a ﬁrst-
order linear diﬀerential equation for the average density
matrix ρ governed by a symmetric super-operator, we
can diagonalize the latter and then use the exponential
map to obtain, with great accuracy, the time-evolution
of ρ averaged over dynamical noise. We do this for each
realization of static disorder, performing eventually the
ensemble average. We can then say that the average over
dynamical noise is treated analytically, while the average
over static disorder is performed numerically.

The transfer eﬃciency, which depends upon the initial

density matrix ρin, is now given by

where (cid:104)...(cid:105)W represents the average over static disorder.
As before, we study the eﬃciency at the ﬂuorescence
time tﬂ = /Γﬂ. It is indeed clear that this is an impor-
tant time-scale for the system, since most of the excita-
tion goes away within tﬂ. Consequently, if the dephasing
γφ is smaller than the ﬂuorescence width Γﬂ, it will not
have enough time to signiﬁcantly aﬀect the system dy-
namics. On the other hand, when γφ > Γﬂ, the dephasing
will aﬀect the various coherent features of the dynamics
within the trimer, as we discuss below.

form grid with 100 points) for diﬀerent values of the dephasing
strength γφ, as indicated in the legend. The values of the pa-
rameters are ∆ = 0 cm−1, Vrc = 1 cm−1, κ = 0.01 cm−1,
and Γﬂ = 10−4 cm−1, the same as in Fig. 2. The ensemble
average is over 2000 realizations of disorder.

A. The zero-gap case

When considering the case with ∆ = 0, simple symme-
try considerations show that the optimal detuning must
remain δEopt
rc = 0 also in the presence of dephasing. In
order to conﬁrm this, we ﬁx W = Wopt (see (12)) and
study the eﬃciency as a function of the detuning δErc
for diﬀerent values of the dephasing strength γφ.

The results are reported in Fig. 6. First of all, we
observe that the presence of dephasing makes the sys-
tem more and more resistant to detuning between the
initial state and the RC. Indeed, while the eﬃciency is
still maximized for δErc = 0, it remains high in a region
which grows with γφ. This is consistent with the fact
that, while the width of the resonant peak in the vari-
able δErc for γφ = 0 can be considered as an eﬀect of
quantum coherence, the incoherent dynamics generated
by the Haken–Strobl master equation gives rise to higher
eﬃciency even oﬀ-resonance.

In order to show how the optimal disorder is aﬀected
by dephasing, we ﬁx δErc = δEopt
rc = 0 (optimal detuning
in absence of dephasing) and plot the correspondent ef-
ﬁciency as a function of the static disorder W (cid:48) = W/√2
for diﬀerent values of the dephasing γφ, see Fig. 7. The
dephasing, when not too strong compared with the ﬂuo-
rescence width, does not change the position of the max-
imal eﬃciency at Wopt.

A remarkable eﬀect is that dephasing (if not too
strong) enhances transport for small disorder strength
W < Wopt, while it is essentially irrelevant for W >
Wopt. This is consistent with the noise-assisted transport
picture [19, 20], which predicts that the eﬃciency is gen-
erally enhanced by dephasing, but it also suggests that

horizontal white line). This resonance, absent for small
dephasing, corresponds to the RC energy being equal to
the energy of the superradiant state. Even if our previous
estimate of optimal disorder still lies between the curves
enclosing the regions of 1% and 5% below the maximal
eﬃciency (blue circle in panel (b) of Fig. 8), the structure
of the contour lines is very diﬀerent for two reasons: (i)
transport is strongly enhanced by dephasing for small
disorder; (ii) due to the additional broad resonance at
δErc = ∆, we have two resonance peaks instead of one
(compare panels (a) and (b) of Fig. 8). For a larger
dephasing noise, only the broad resonance at δErc = ∆
remains.

We can thus conclude that the resonance δErc =
V 2
rc/∆, given by (11), coexists, in the presence of small
dephasing, with another resonance at δErc = ∆, which
eventually dominates the dynamics for large dephasing.
The latter condition shows that, even if we start from
the subradiant state, the incoherent dynamics generated
by dephasing rests upon the direct transfer to the RC
from the superradiant state, since the latter is continu-
ously populated by the action of dephasing. This is at
variance with the coherent resonance conditions found in
the previous section.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We considered a paradigmatic model of quantum net-
work, namely a trimer in which two sites are coupled to a
third site, representing a reaction center where the exci-
tation can be trapped. The optimal conditions of energy
transfer are analyzed in presence of diﬀerent kind of dis-
turbances: static disorder and dynamical noise. In simi-
lar networks the states can be classiﬁed as superradiant
or subradiant, based on how they transfer the excitation
into the reaction center.

Subradiant states are not directly coupled to the re-
action center, but static on-site disorder can eﬀectively
couple them with superradiant states. This opens an
indirect path for the transfer of excitation from subra-
diant states to the reaction center, mediated by the su-
perradiant state. The static disorder which activates the
transfer from subradiant states, when too strong, hinders
transport, so that an optimal disorder condition can be
determined.

We analyze in detail such a model. Four parameters
determine the diﬀerent regimes in which the trimer can
operate: the energy distance ∆ between the subradiant
and the superradiant state, the intensity W of static dis-
order, which induces a random coupling between subra-
diant and superradiant states, the direct coupling Vrc be-
tween the superradiant state and the reaction center, and
the detuning δErc between the subradiant initial state
and the reaction center.

We study how to optimize the energy transfer eﬃciency
by varying both the disorder strength W and the detun-
ing δErc. The optimal conditions in absence of dephasing

der strength W (cid:48) = W/

diﬀerent values of the dephasing strength (see legend). The

such noise-assisted transport is more eﬃcient when the
energy levels are suﬃciently close to each other. For suf-
ﬁciently large dephasing strength, the eﬃciency becomes
a decreasing function of W (cid:48), in such condition static dis-
order is only detrimental to transport (see dashed curve
in Fig. 7).

B. The ﬁnite-gap case

The results of the previous section show that, for the
zero-gap case, the presence of dephasing does not aﬀect
the estimate for the optimal detuning and also the opti-
mal disorder is modiﬁed only for a quite large dephasing
strength.

On the contrary, in the presence of a non-vanishing
gap ∆ between the subradiant initial state and the su-
perradiant one, dephasing changes the situation in a re-
markable way.
In Fig. 8 the average eﬃciency in the
plane (W (cid:48), δErc) is shown for two diﬀerent values of the
dephasing strength. The system parameters used in this
ﬁgure coincide with those of Fig. 5, except for the dephas-
ing. In panel (a) we present the case of small dephasing

dot, which represents the optimal conditions without de-
phasing, lies between the curves enclosing the regions of
1% and 5% below the maximal eﬃciency, and the small-
disorder resonance condition (13) is perfectly reproduced.
On the other side, in panel (b) of Fig. 8, where the case
of a larger dephasing is shown (γφ = 1.26 10−3 cm−1),
the picture is radically diﬀerent. A second important
resonance at δErc = ∆ appears (indicated by a dashed

γφ = 10−4 cm−1 is shown and it should be compared with the results shown in Fig. 5. In panel (b) the case of larger dephasing

and 5% (full curve) of the maximal eﬃciency. The values of the parameters are ∆ = 20 cm−1, Vrc = 10 cm−1, κ = 0.01 cm−1,
and Γﬂ = 10−4 cm−1, the same as in Fig. 5. We sampled the eﬃciency on a 120 × 400 uniform grid. The ensemble average is

noise are given by:

rc/∆ for Vrc (cid:46) ∆.

(i) W (cid:39) Vrc and δErc = 0 for Vrc (cid:29) ∆;
(ii) W (cid:39) Vrc and δErc = V 2
The origin of conditions (i) and (ii) can be synthet-
ically expressed as follows. The disorder strength W
determines the amplitude of the coupling between the
subradiant donor state (D) and the superradiant bridge
state (B), while Vrc is the coupling between the super-
radiant bridge state (B) and the RC acceptor state (A).
Thus the condition W (cid:39) Vrc implies a symmetry between
the D–B and B–A couplings, which optimizes transport.
Moreover, the condition δErc = 0 corresponds to a donor
and an acceptor with the same energy, which also helps
transport in a coherent regime. On the other hand, when

W (cid:39) Vrc (cid:46) ∆, the stochastic nature of the D–B coupling

induces a shift of the optimal detuning, which is now de-
termined by the presence, for small values of the D–B
coupling, of a sharp resonance in the transfer eﬃciency
at δErc = V 2

rc/∆.

Regarding the eﬀect of dynamical noise (modeled as
pure dephasing) on the various coherent features we an-
alyze, we show that our condition for the optimal disor-
der is still valid for a not too strong dephasing. On the
other hand, the optimal detuning can be strongly mod-
iﬁed, since dephasing produces an additional resonance
peak, corresponding to the superadiant bridge energy be-
ing equal to that of the RC acceptor. Such peak coexists

with the one obtained via the coherent resonance con-
ditions given above. Dephasing produces a general en-
hancement of the transfer eﬃciency for small disorder,
providing also a signiﬁcant stability with respect to the
energy detuning δErc.

We believe that the principles of our analysis, even
if it has been carried out on a very simple model, are
relevant to all those quantum networks in which a sub-
radiant (or trapping-free) subspace is present. Speciﬁ-
cally, we think that the interplay of an incoherent reso-
nant condition with a coherent one is a generic feature
of those quantum networks aimed at modeling realistic
light-harvesting complexes, such as ring structures with
a trapping site at their center akin to those observed in
natural LHI complexes.

Especially to understand the enhancement in trans-
port due to disorder, which is ubiquitous in natural light-
harvesting complexes, it is necessary to go beyond the
standard perturbative analysis, since the coupling be-
tween peripheral sites and the reaction center is coher-
ently enhanced by superradiance, producing a nontrivial
interplay with the various sources of noise and disorder.
