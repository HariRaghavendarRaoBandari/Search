ABSTRACT

Corona structures and processes during the pre-impulsive stage of solar erup-
tion are crucial to understanding the physics leading to the subsequent explosive
energy release. Here we present the ﬁrst microwave imaging study of a hot ﬂux
rope structure during the pre-impulsive stage of an eruptive M7.7 solar ﬂare,
with the Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH) at 17 GHz. The ﬂux rope is also
observed by the SDO/AIA in its hot passbands of 94 and 131 ˚A. In the microwave
data, it is revealed as an overall arcade-like structure consisting of several inten-
sity enhancements bridged by generally weak emissions, with brightness temper-
atures (TB) varying from ∼10,000 K to ∼20,000 K. Locations of microwave inten-
sity enhancements along the structure remain relatively ﬁxed at certain speciﬁc
parts of the ﬂux rope, indicating that the distribution of emitting electrons is af-
fected by the large scale magnetic conﬁguration of the twisted ﬂux rope. Wavelet
analysis shows a pronounced 2-min period of the microwave TB variation during
the pre-impulsive stage of interest. The period agrees well with that reported for
AIA sunward-contracting loops and upward ejective plasmoids (suggested to be
reconnection outﬂows). This suggests that both periodicities are controlled by
the same reconnection process that takes place intermittently at a 2-min time

scale. We infer that at least a part of the emission is excited by non-thermal en-
ergetic electrons via the gyro-synchrotron mechanism. The study demonstrates

Introduction

Coronal ﬂux ropes, i.e. magnetic structures consisting of ﬁeld lines twisted around each
other, are believed to be one of the major pre-eruptive agents of solar coronal mass ejections
(CMEs) with free magnetic energy to drive the eruption (e.g. Low & Hundhausen 1995; Chen
1996; Forbes 2000; Low 2001). Their existence has been revealed by latest observational
studies using high-quality imaging data of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA/SDO:
Lemen et al. 2012) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO: Pesnell et al. 2012) via
its high-temperature passbands at 131 ˚A (∼11 MK) and 94 ˚A (∼7 MK) (Zhang et al. 2012;
Cheng et al. 2013; Sun et al. 2014; Song et al. 2014, 2015). It has been therefore suggested
that such a pre-eruption ﬂux rope contains plasmas as hot as ∼10 MK, possibly heated by an
underlying reconnection process. Yet, it remains elusive about how the reconnection works
to heat or even form the ﬂux rope and whether non-thermal energetic electrons are produced
during the process.

An eruptive M7.7 ﬂare took place on 19 July 2012, with valuable observations that may
contribute to resolve the above issue. The event was well-observed by the SDO and Reuven
Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI: Lin et al. 2002) spacecraft, as
well as the ground-based microwave Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH: Nakajima et al.
1994; Takano et al. 1997). A number of studies on the event have been published, revealing
many intriguing evolutionary details of the ﬂare (e.g., Krucker & Battaglia 2014; Liu 2013;
Liu et al. 2013; Patsourakos et al. 2013; Sun et al. 2014; Morgachev et al. 2014).
It was
established that the eruption was associated with a pre-existing high-temperature ﬂux rope
structure according to AIA/SDO. The ﬂux rope was likely formed by a preceding C4.5 ﬂare
that took place ∼7 hours earlier. The rope stayed and evolved in the corona for several
hours before its eventual eruption leading to the M7.7 ﬂare and a fast CME propagating at
a speed > 1000 km s−1 (Patsourakos et al. 2013).

Liu et al. (2013) presented a comprehensive study on the event using both SDO and
RHESSI data. They found that the event belongs to the well-known Masuda-type ﬂare with

– 3 –

a hard x-ray (HXR) source high-lying in the corona above the ﬂaring soft x-ray (SXR) ar-
cade (Masuda et al. 1994). They examined the spacing diﬀerence between X-ray sources at
various energy bands, as well as the temperature distribution with a forward-modelling dif-
ferential emission measure (DEM) analysis (Aschwanden et al. 2013), to infer sites of plasma
heating and electron acceleration induced by reconnection. Along with other detailed mea-
surements on contracting/shrinking plasma loops and ejective plasmoids, they concluded
that the primary loci of heating and electron acceleration were in the reconnection outﬂow
regions, rather than the reconnection site itself. In addition, they also found that the recon-
nection outﬂows, as revealed by fast contracting loops and upward-ﬂowing plasmoids during
the ﬂare pre-impulsive stage, exhibited a quasi-periodic occurrence rate at ∼2 mins. This
last ﬁnding is of close relevance to the study presented here.

Most previous studies of this event focused on the SDO and RHESSI data, while the
microwave data of the event recorded by NoRH at 17 and 34 GHz have not been paid enough
attention. The coronal microwave emission is contributed by both thermal bremsstrahlung
and non-thermal gyro-synchrotron mechanisms (e.g., Dulk 1985). Emission given by the
latter carries valuable information about energetic electrons and magnetic ﬁeld strength and
geometry. Liu (2013) and Morgachev et al. (2014) did analyze the NoRH microwave data to
reveal the spatial and velocity distributions of energetic electrons along loops of the major
M7.7 ﬂare, yet mainly during the impulsive stage. Here we analyze the microwave data during
the pre-impulsive stage focusing on the relatively-weak yet signiﬁcant microwave emission in
the region corresponding to the hot AIA ﬂux rope structure. To our knowledge, this is the
ﬁrst imaging study of a hot ﬂux rope in the microwave regime. The study reveals valuable
information about the ﬂux rope structure and the generally weak reconnection process during
the ﬂare pre-impulsive stage. These are representative of major physical ingredients leading
to the eventual solar eruption. Section 2 introduces more relevant details of the event,
as already presented by other authors. The third section shows our major results on the
microwave emission associated with the ﬂux rope. The fourth section discusses the nature of
coronal microwave emission, which is followed by the section of conclusions and discussion.

2. Data analysis and overview of the M7.7 eruptive ﬂare

The M7.7 ﬂare occurred at 04:17 UT and peaked at 05:58 UT on July 19 2012. It was a
limb event from NOAA AR 11520. The event can be separated into pre-impulsive (04:17 UT
to 05:16 UT) and impulsive (05:16 UT to 05:43 UT) stages, according to the derivative of
the GOES SXR light curves and the HXR 25-50 keV proﬁles (c.f., Liu et al. 2013). The
emission from the northern ﬂare loop foot was partly occulted by the solar disk, allowing the

– 4 –

above-the-loop-top source of the HXR emission to be observed. In Figure 1(a-c), we present
the 131, 94, and 171 ˚A images observed at ∼04:47 UT, during the pre-impulsive stage to
show the pre-existing ﬂux rope structure. The rope is best seen at 131 ˚A and almost invisible
at 171 ˚A indicating it contains high-temperature plasmas. An accompanying animation is
available online showing the evolution of the event. The yellow dashed curves in Figure 1(a)
delineate the inferred outer border of the ﬂux rope structure, within which some twisted

connecting the tip of the cusp-like ﬂare loops and the northern end of the ﬂux rope (pointed
by the white arrow), which has been recognized as the high-temperature current sheet along
which reconnections took place (Liu et al. 2013).

In the pre-impulsive stage, the ﬂux rope structure exhibited a slow-rising motion (see
the online animation). Reconnection outﬂows in the form of downward contracting arcades
and ejective plasmoids have been observed along the current sheet structure (Liu 2013;
Liu et al. 2013). Of particular interest is the quasi-periodic occurrence of these reconnection-
induced features. Liu et al. (2013) found that there were 29 downward contracting arcades
and 25 ejective plasmoids from 04:15 to 05:25 UT, i.e., the pre-impulsive phase (see their
Figure 7). We repeated this analysis, and show our result in Figure 2(a) with height-
time maps along slice S1 (see Figure 1(a)). The red and black dashed tracks represent the
upward and downward moving structures, respectively. We found 24 contracting arcades
from 04:20 to 05:15 UT and 14 eruptive plasmoids from 04:20 and 04:50 UT, yielding an
average occurrence rate of 2.3 and 2.1 mins. Both outﬂows have their origin from the vertical
current sheet structure that is indicated by the central long-dashed line in Figure 2(a). The
linear-ﬁtting speeds of these tracks are in a range of 10 - 60 km s−1 for the downward-
moving structures and 50 - 400 km s−1 for the upward moving structures. These results are
consistent with those obtained by Liu et al. (2013), indicating the intermittent nature of the
pre-impulsive reconnection. Here we will examine whether this intermittency has imprints on
the microwave emission that is likely related to energetic electrons. Note that, according to
RHESSI the coronal HXR emission within the ﬂux rope at this stage is too weak to provide
statistically-meaningful photon counts.

For this purpose, we use the NoRH data recorded during the pre-impulsive stage of
this event at both 17 and 34 GHz, with a 1s cadence and beam size being ∼17 arcsecs for
17 GHz (shown in Figure 3(a)) and 8.7 arcsecs for 34 GHz. According to the NoRH analysis
manual (http://solar.nro.nao.ac.jp/norh/doc/, (manual version 3.3)), there are 3 diﬀerent
NoRH synthesis methods, named as Hanaoka, Koshix, and Fujiki programs, with the Koshix
one being the most appropriate for analyzing diﬀuse sources such as the one studied here.
So we mainly use this program for our study. For comparison, we also tried the Hanaoka
program, and found our main results are not aﬀected.

– 5 –

In the pre-impulsive phase of the M7.7 ﬂare, the activities of the Sun were limited to AR
11520 (there was no other bright active region) and the maximum brightness temperature
(TB) was roughly 30000 K. Therefore, the noise in the NoRH raw images (before applying
the CLEAN procedure) of the radio Sun is essentially determined by the system noise, which
is given by the sum of the antenna temperature due to the quiet Sun and the receiver noise
temperature. According to Takano et al. (1996), the system noise temperature for 1s data is
∼ 1000-1500 K for 17 GHz and ∼ 6000 K for 34 GHz. In the synthesis of 17 GHz images, we
set the CLEAN level to be 3000 K that is the default value, and integrated 12 frames (12s) of
NoRH raw images before applying the CLEAN algorithm to further reduce the system noise.
For 34 GHz data we used the Hanaoka program (note the Koshix program is not applicable
to 34 GHz data) and found that in the ﬂux rope region of interest TB is considerably less
than the corresponding sensitivity level (∼ 6000 K). Therefore, in the following we only
analyze the 17 GHz data of NoRH.

3. Microwave imaging of the pre-impulsive hot ﬂux rope structure

Coronal microwave sources were present around and above the cusp region following
the earlier C4.5 ﬂare, with enhanced activities during the pre-impulsive stage of the M7.7
ﬂare.
In Figure 1(d), we have over-plotted the ﬂux rope regime depicted by the dashed
curves in Figure 1(a).
It can be seen that some distinct yet relatively weak microwave
sources appear in the middle part of the ﬂux rope region. In Figure 3, we further present
4 snapshots of the NoRH microwave images. See also the online animation accompanying
Figure 1 for the evolutionary process from 04:35 UT to 04:55 UT. As mentioned, several
similar bright structures (referred to as microwave islands) with TB ∼10000 to over 20000 K
are present within the AIA 131 ˚A ﬂux rope structure. Between adjacent sources, relatively
weaker emission (TB ∼10000 - 14000 K) exists. This forms an overall arcade-like microwave
structure threaded by the localized brightness maxima. The number of these TB maxima
varies from 3 to 5. Their TB changes rapidly over time, yet their locations seem to be
relatively ﬁxed to speciﬁc parts of the large structure.

The arcade-like microwave structure is clearly separated from the bright ﬂaring loop
source, as seen from the second, third and forth columns of Figure 3, and the animation.
The overall microwave structure presents a gradually-rising motion. This agrees with the
very similar motion of the AIA ﬂux rope structure, as shown by the height-time maps along
slice S2 (see Figure 2(b)) (for AIA 131 ˚A data) and 2(c) (for NoRH 17 GHz data) from
which we see that the trajectory of the microwave source (indicated by a long-dashed line)
lies in the middle part of the ﬂux rope structure. The average rising speed of microwave

– 6 –

structure is ∼28 km s−1. This further supports the idea that the microwave arcade-like
structure corresponds to the internal part of the hot ﬂux rope observed in the AIA 131,
94 ˚A passbands. Note that it is not possible to tell which speciﬁc AIA structure in Figure 1
contains the microwave-emitting energetic electrons, since both background and foreground
structures are projected together onto the plane of the sky.

The energetic (or thermal) electrons accounting for the microwave emission are likely
produced and ﬁlled into the ﬂux rope by the ongoing reconnection during the pre-impulsive
stage. The reconnection is revealed by the AIA-observed contracting arcades and upward
ejection of plasmoids from the current sheet structure, according to previous studies (e.g.,
Liu 2013; Liu et al. 2013). In order to ﬁnd whether the intermittency associated with AIA re-
connection outﬂows (see Figure 2) have some imprint on the microwave emission, we conduct
wavelet analyses on the temporal proﬁles of TB in the ﬂux rope region.

To analyze the temporal variation of the microwave intensity, we ﬁrst average the TB
values in Region R for the overall ﬂux rope region (deﬁned in Figure 3), from 04:35 UT
to 04:55 UT. The normalized TB averages after subtracting the general variation trend are
presented as the red plot in Figure 4(a), and the obtained wavelet and global power spectra
in Figure 4(b), from which we see a signiﬁcant period of 2 mins which carries the strongest
spectral power. Almost the same 2-min period appears in a similar wavelet analysis for the
normalized average TB values in Circle C1 which is selected to be centered around the middle
microwave island and moving outward along S2.

For comparison, we also conduct wavelet analysis with the data representative of the
quite-Sun microwave background in Circle C2. See Figure 4(d) for the results. The power
is much weaker and no signiﬁcant periodicity exists. This indicates that the above 2-min
periodicity is physical and indeed associated with the microwave ﬂux rope structure.

Thus, we conclude that the microwave emission exhibits a signiﬁcant 2-min quasi-

periodic oscillation. The period agrees well with that reported for the AIA sunward-contracting
loops and upward ejective plasmoids (suggested to be reconnection outﬂows) during the same
period (see Figure 2, Liu et al. 2013), indicating both quasi-periodicities have the same phys-
ical origins given by the pre-impulsive reconnection along the thin vertical current sheet.

4. Discussion on the nature of the coronal microwave emission

The ﬁrst issue we should clarify is about the physical signiﬁcance of the weak coronal
microwave sources, i.e., whether the signals are real or produced artiﬁcially by the NoRH
image synthesis procedure. As mentioned in Sec. 2, the NoRH system noise of 1s data is

– 7 –

∼1000-1500 K, and we have integrated 12s of NoRH raw images before applying the CLEAN
algorithm to further reduce the noise. With a CLEAN level set to be 3000 K, we suggest
that sources observed at 17 GHz with TB >3000 K are real. The physical signiﬁcance of
these microwave sources are also supported by their location and dynamics that are highly
correlated with the AIA structure.

Then we need to infer whether the microwave sources are given by non-thermal en-
ergetic electrons via the gyro-synchrotron emission or by thermal electrons through the
bremsstrahlung emission, or by a combination of both (Dulk 1985). This is in general diﬃ-
cult since we cannot take direct measurements on thermal and magnetic parameters of the
corona sources. One traditional way to resolve this issue is to examine the rough microwave
spectrum using the NoRH two-frequency data (e.g., Narukage et al. 2014), however, as men-
tioned the 34 GHz data are below the NoRH sensitivity and not usable here. Nevertheless,
there still exists a qualitative approach to infer the nature of the microwave emission.

It is well-known that the plasma temperature and emission measure can be deduced
with the DEM method. Given these parameters, the thermal bremsstrahlung contribution
can be calculated with the following equation given by Dulk (1985) in the optical thin regime,

TB = 9.78 × 10−3

EM

ν 2T 1/2

× (24.5 + ln(T /ν))

(1)

where TB (K) is the brightness temperature, EM=n2L is the total emission measure (n (cm−3)
is the number density and L (cm) is the column depth), T (K) is the plasma temperature,
and ν (Hz) is the frequency. For the event of study, two groups of authors have done the
DEM analysis using diﬀerent methods (Liu et al. 2013; Sun et al. 2014). Here, we simply
read the published numbers of the DEM-weighted average T and EM, without repeating the
DEM analysis. Comparing Figure 6 of Liu et al. (2013) and Figure 11 of Sun et al. (2014),
we see that results of the two studies are qualitatively similar, with the ﬂux rope outlined
by regions of high T and EM, yet both parameters are still signiﬁcantly less than those in
the ﬂare loops. Within the C1 region deﬁned in Figure 3(d), around 04:50 UT we read from
Sun et al. (2014) that T is in a range of ∼ 6 - 8 MK and EM is in a range of ∼ 1 - 2.5 ×1028
cm−5, and from Liu et al. (2013) that T varies from 3 - 6 MK and EM varies from 1 - 2
×1028 cm−5. With these numbers, we obtain that the thermal TB at 17 GHz varies in a range
of 2000 - 6000 K. Assuming that there is not suﬃcient material cooler than these tempera-
ture ranges to contribute signiﬁcantly to the brightness temperature, the NoRH brightness
temperatures appear to require a non-thermal contribution.

To further show that at least the oscillating part of the microwave signals is non-thermal,
we examine temporal variations of light curves of diﬀerent AIA passbands which are related
to thermal plasmas to see whether a similar 2-min oscillation exists or not. If not, we may

– 8 –

attribute that the microwave oscillation reported above belongs to non-thermal emission
of energetic electrons. To do this, we plot in Figure 5 the light curves observed with the
AIA 131, 94, 335, 211, 193, and 171 ˚A passbands from 04:35 to 04:55 UT in the ﬂux rope
region (upper panel) and C1 region (lower panel). We see that in these EUV channels, the
light curves vary rather smoothly with most curves declining gradually (due to the rise and
expansion of the ﬂux rope) without any notable oscillations. This further supports that at
least the oscillating component of the microwave sources is given by non-thermal energetic
electrons, possibly through the gryo-synchrotron emission mechanism (Dulk 1985).

5. Conclusions and Discussion

Investigating pre-impulsive processes is of crucial importance to understanding the
physics leading to explosive energy release of solar eruption. Here we present such a study
using microwave imaging data of a ﬂux rope structure observed during the pre-impulsive
phase of the M7.7 ﬂare on July 19 2012. Previous studies on the same event already showed
the ﬂux rope is of high-temperature and is connected to the ﬂare reconnection region. Based
on these studies, we focus on the microwave data at 17 GHz obtained by NoRH to reveal
the microwave characteristics of the same structure. We ﬁnd that the ﬂux rope, while being
hot in general, contains microwave-emitting energetic electrons. The ﬂux rope, as viewed
in the microwave, exhibits several local maxima of emission intensities with relatively ﬁxed
locations. These maxima,
i.e., microwave islands, are bridged by generally weaker emission,
forming an overall arcade-like structure.

We also show that the ﬂux rope microwave sources seem at least partly due to non-
thermal energetic electrons, possibly at energies of hundreds of keV (e.g., White et al. 2011;
Kundu et al. 2001, 2004). High localization of these microwave sources indicates that the
energetic electrons may be aﬀected or conﬁned by the large scale magnetic structure within
the ﬂux rope. The conﬁnement is probably via the well-known magnetic mirror eﬀect if local
magnetic enhancements are present. These magnetic enhancements can be due to twisting
ﬂux rope ﬁeld lines and/or their interaction with nearby magnetic structures. Thus, the
microwave islands can be used to infer sites of magnetic enhancements within the ﬂux rope
structure, which are at present very diﬃcult, if not impossible, to measure directly.

It is also found that the microwave emission is characterized by a 2-min oscillation
period. The period agrees well with the occurrence rate of the AIA-observed contracting
loops and ejective plasmoids that are manifestations of reconnection outﬂows during the pre-
impulsive stage. This correlation indicates that the microwave periodicity is associated with
the reconnection that takes place and releases energetic electrons intermittently every ∼2-min

– 9 –

interval. Note that oscillations with similar periodicity during ﬂares have been reported and
attributed to ﬂare-released fast magneto-sonic wave trains (e.g., Ofman et al. 2011; Liu et al.
2012; Yang et al. 2015), or some external modulations by disturbances associated with the
sunspot (Sych et al. 2009; Reznikova & Shibasaki 2011) or the photosphere/chromosphere
oscillations (Kislyakova et al. 2011). These independent observational ﬁndings, together
with ours, point to an intermittent nature of the ﬂaring reconnections, not only during their
impulsive stage but also in the pre-impulsive stage.

presents the image of NoRH at 17 GHz. The yellow dashed curves in (a) delineate the ﬂux
rope structure in 131 ˚A which have been superposed onto the microwave image in (d). The
white arrow in (a) points to the vertical thin current sheet structure. Slices S1 and S2 are
used to plot the height-time maps shown in Figure 2. The short bars at the inner end of S1
and S2 indicate the starting point of distance measurement along the slice.

Fig. 2.— Height-time maps along Slices S1 and S2. See Figure 1 for slice locations. Panel (a)
is for AIA 131 ˚A to show the reconnection outﬂows, observed from 04:14 UT to 05:22 UT.
Downward-contracting loops are indicated by black dashed lines, upward moving plasmoids
by red dashed lines. The middle red long dashed line shows the reconnecting current sheet
region. Panels (b) and (c) are height-time maps along S2 for AIA 131 ˚A and the brightness
temperature data of NoRH at 17 GHz, respectively, from 04:35 UT to 04:55 UT. The NoRH
data are synthesis images processed by the Koshix program with 12 s integration of the raw
data. Dashed lines in (b) and (c) indicate the rising motion of the microwave structure.

Fig. 3.— Image sequence of the NoRH 17 GHz microwave data from 04:40 UT to 04:52 UT,
showing the brightness temperature (TB). Region R indicates the overall microwave ﬂux
rope regime observed at 17 GHz, and Circle C1 (C2) denotes the region surrounding the
middle microwave intensity enhancement (the solar background) with radius ∼20 arcsecs.
Both region R and Circle C1 move outward along S2 with a projection speed of ∼28 km s−1.
The beam size of NoRH 17 GHz is shown in panel (a).

Fig. 4.— Wavelet analysis of the NoRH 17 GHz TB temporal variations. Panel (a) shows
the averaged TB (normalized after trend subtraction) in Region R and C2 from 04:35 UT to
04:55 UT. Panels (b) and (c) show the corresponding power spectra and the global power
spectra given by wavelet analysis, respectively. Panels (d) is the wavelet results obtained
for the data averaged (also normalized with trend subtraction) in C2 (see Figure 3) from
04:35 UT to 04:55 UT. The trend proﬁle is obtained by taking average of the original TB
data every 400s. Subtracting the long-term average trend does not aﬀect the wavelet analysis
result as long as the term is much longer than 2 mins. The horizontal dashed lines in the
global spectra indicate the signiﬁcance level of 99%. Cross-hatched regions on the spectra
show the cone of inﬂuence. Note that around 0.5-1 min, there exist some spectral power.
However, the corresponding spectral features last only for few mins with much less power
than the 2-min one, and the associated period varies in a relatively-large range from 0.5 to
1 min. We therefore suggest that these periodicities are not signiﬁcant.
