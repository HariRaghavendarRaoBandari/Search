The concepts of Planck charges are summarized and extended in a consistent and uniﬁed manner
to include Planck currents. These Planck parameters form a set of indicators serving as the boundary
markers signaling the buﬀer zone separating the quantum gravity physics beyond Planck energy scale
from the ordinary physics below the Planck scale. Combining the concepts of Planck charges with
the Dirac electric-magnetic charge quantization relation, a lower bound is discovered and attributed
to the value of magnetic monopole as half of the Planck magnetic monopole. The value of the
running electric ﬁne structure constant is required to be conﬁned to a restricted interval to keep
physics involving magnetic monopoles below the Planck scale. It provides a prediction about the
hermitic Shangri-La, a remote place the magnetic monopoles are inhabiting near the boundary but
still within the scope of ordinary physics.
It opens a window of hope to the theoretical and/or
experimental probe for magnetic monopoles realizing that the situation is accessible in the early
universe.

I. Introduction
Magnetic monopoles have been wished for by physi-
cists for a preference for detailed duality between electric-
ity and magnetism.[1–3] Enthusiastic huntings for mag-
netic monopoles have not been defeated even though
they have been evading experimental investigations for
centuries.[4–6] Among the early important ﬁndings re-
garding magnetic monopoles in modern physics was
Dirac’s discovery of electric-magnetic charge quantiza-
tion relation.[7] The Dirac magnetic monopole was the-
oretically augmented as a topological soliton solution to
the ’t Hooft-Polyakov monopole, which contains Dirac
monopole as the far ﬁeld limit.[8, 9] Various attempts
of grand uniﬁed theories(GUTs) revived the possibility
for the existence of magnetic monopole under situations
like in the early universe. Magnetic monopoles have been
found common products in GUT symmetry breaking pro-
cesses down to Standard Model particle physics.[10–12]
As long as the GUT symmetry breaking process took
place sometime before the end of inﬂation, a short pe-
riod of rapid expansion of the early universe according
to the present standard inﬂationary cosmology, magnetic
monopoles can be produced, and then be stretched over
a large scale of the universe before the end of inﬂation so
that it leaves us very sparse trace of their appearance
and existence.[13–16] In a word, the scarcity of mag-
netic monopoles in the present universe does not deny
the possibility of the primordial abundance of magnetic
monopoles produced in the GUT symmetry breaking pro-
cess occurred during the early stage of the universe. The
theoretical probability of magnetic monopole existence
remains abundant and is still under active studies.

On the other hand, likewise to the situation for mag-
netic monopoles, a successful quantum theory of gravity
has been the purpose of a belabored search by theoretical
physicists for nearly half a century. Several provisional

strategies, such as superstring theory and loop quan-
tum gravity theory have been formulated after prolonged
attempts. The non-renormalizability of the straightfor-
wardly quantized theory of general relativity made physi-
cists the expectation that a successful quantum theory of
gravity should be drastically diﬀerent from the ordinary
ﬁeld theories working excellently at relatively low energy
scales when the quantum gravity eﬀects have not yet be-
come signiﬁcant. Serving as the boundary chain links
for the sphere of quantum gravity is a set of physical
quantities that at certain speciﬁc values, become critical
points beyond which the gravitational eﬀects of physical
processes grow to as important as their non-gravitational
eﬀects, namely the strong and electroweak interactions,
knowing that the gravitational eﬀects are a great many
orders of magnitude weaker than other forces of the Na-
ture at low energy scales. The energy scale as a major
controller of the strength of physical eﬀects, oﬀers one of
the major threshold indicators to the border of quantum
gravity: the Planck mass, or the Planck scale energy. A
group of physical parameters are needed as the anchor-
ing points of Planck scale, which together delineate the
border of quantum gravity.

This letter surveys a set of Planck scale anchoring
points. The concept of Planck charges: Planck mass,
Planck electric charge and Planck magnetic monopole
can be extended to Planck currents such as Planck elec-
tric current and magnetic current. By combining the
concepts of Planck electric and magnetic charges with
the Dirac electric-magnetic charge quantization relation,
it points out a window marked by a restricted range of
value for the electric ﬁne structure constant which is run-
ning by renormalization group ﬂow with energy scale. In-
side this window of hope, neither the electric charge nor
the magnetic charge/monopole would tough the danger-
ous quantum gravity border line so that ordinary physics

involving magnetic monopoles enjoys the possibility.

The conscious recognition of the existence of such a
window of hope advises that further eﬀorts at the low en-
ergy end can be conceded; and lots of attempts already in
the mid-high energy direction are receiving assuring con-
solation and encouragement to further continue. It pro-
vides a discriminative direction to the eﬀorts in search of
magnetic monopoles and shall become a driving towards
the eventual ﬁnding of the missing object.

II. Planck Charges as Mass, Electric Charge

and Magnetic Monopole

For later convenience, we ﬁrst do some reviews on
Planck charges.[17, 18] Einstein’s general relativity the-
ory of gravity is thought to be the approximation of
some quantum gravity theory necessary at ultra high
spacetime curvature and energy scale while Newtonian
gravitation is the weak ﬁeld approximation to Einstein’s
theory of general relativity. Traditionally, through di-
mensional analysis, the deterministic parameters can be
deﬁned through Newtonian gravitation relation for the
characterization of the so called Planck scale.

Pretendingly viewing an elementary particle as a minute
black hole, down to its Schwarzschild radius (rS = 2Gm
c2 )
the gravitational eﬀects of the particle become violent.
The reduced Compton wavelength (λ = 
mc ) is a char-
acteristic length scale of the quantum eﬀects for elemen-
tary particles. The Compton wavelength decreases but

2

the Schwarzschild radius increases with the energy of the
particle. These two length scales move to each other from
two sides of the Planck length when the energy of the par-
ticle approaches to that equivalent to Planck mass. Thus
coming to the energy scale as high as Planck mass and
down to the length scale as short as Planck length, both
the gravitational and the quantum eﬀects of elementary
particles are signiﬁcant, and particle physics and gravi-
tation are no longer disconnected with each other as they
were at lower energy and large length scales. The Planck
time is the characterization of how rapidly the relevant
physical processes are bursting at the Planck scale. The
Planck scale physics in the Nature is thought to occur at
the beginning of the Big Bang and inside black holes.

Nevertheless, this is not a complete set of physical
quantities that can be used in deﬁning the so called
Planck scale. Limits exist for various physical processes
to stop them from running into the dangerous zone of
quantum gravity physics. Bringing in the concept of
Planck electric charge and Planck magnetic monopole
marks a ﬁner deﬁnition of the Planck scale. Based on
the electric Coulomb’s law, in its scalar form,

F =

the requirement that the Coulomb’s constant ke assumes

Employing the deﬁnition of the Planck length lP , the
Planck time tP and the Planck mass mP obtained above,
the Planck electric charge is thus deduced:

QP =r c

(8)

Here e is the unit electron charge measured at the present
low energy experiment status.

Applying the above deﬁnition, the electric ﬁne struc-
ture constant is related to the ratio of the low energy
electron charge value to the Planck electric charge,

Gliding over a large span of energy scales, the eﬀects
of renormalization group ﬂow of quantum ﬁelds pushes
up the electric ﬁne structure constant towards the unit
value near Planck scale meanwhile the elementary elec-
tron charge increases to the Planck electric charge,

By ordinary physics is called the perturbative quantum
ﬁeld theoretic treatment of three of the four fundamental
interactions of the Nature from low to mid-high energy
scales. The strength of the electric interaction e.g., with
the electric ﬁne structure constant being a symbolic cou-
pling constant, is asserted to scale up with the energy
scale according to the renormalization group equation
analysis. An energy scale and an elevated electron elec-
tric charge value exist such that the ordinary perturba-
tive quantum ﬁeld theory breaks down as the coupling
constant approaches to unit value when the energy scale
coming close to the Planck mass and when the electron
electric charge coming close to the Planck electric charge.
In the meantime, the comparability between the gravita-
tional and non-gravitational eﬀects of physical processes
newly appearing near the Planck scale demands a uni-
ﬁed treatment of all the Nature’s four fundamental in-
teractions. But this should be an intrinsically diﬀerent
theoretical framework from the ordinary physics theories
valid only below the Planck energy scale.

If a strict duality between electricity and magnetism is
obeyed and the magnetic monopoles had existed, there
exists an interaction between two magnetic monopoles
following an electric equivalent magnetic Coulomb’s law,

(13)

Had the magnetic monopoles existed, the Planck mag-
netic monopole would be the threshold value for them to
play with gravity.

III. Planck Electric Current and Planck Mag-

netic Current

Limits should be set for force laws in electromagnetism
to avoid blundering into the Planck scale. One Ampere
of current is such deﬁned by combining Biot-Savat’s Law
and Lorentz force law that the magnetic force between
a unit length section of two equal and parallel electric
currents shall be some particular constant value.

Given that the electric current is determined by the grow-
ing charge and the motion of the particle, the Planck
electric charge is eﬀectively a combined constraint on the
renormalization and the energy of the particle.

The Maxwell equations and force laws involving mag-
netic monopoles can be derived given the duality between
electricity and magnetism. An interaction between two
separated parallel magnetic current sections shall follow
a force law dual to that of the electricity in the above,

IV. The Minimum Dirac Magnetic Monopole
and The Non-Quantum Gravity Window for
Dirac Magnetic Monopole

The Planck charges and Planck currents are derived
using the force laws as indicators of the strength of var-
ious interactions. A scale where the strength of various
interactions become comparable exists and is named the
Planck scale. Checking by directly plugging the deﬁni-
tion of various Planck charges and Planck currents back
into their respective force laws, it is heuristic to see that
the gravitation between two Planck masses, the electric
force between two Planck electric charges and the mag-
netic force between two Planck magnetic monopoles all
separated the Planck length apart share the same mag-
nitude: a force of unit value in the Planck units,

It tells that at the Planck scale all fundamental inter-
actions are of the same magnitude and require a uniﬁed
treatment. The dimensionless coupling constants con-
structed in analogue with the electric ﬁne structure con-
stant would all tend to unit value at the Planck scale,

The growth of charge or equivalently of the coupling con-
stants of most interactions with energy scale is a result of
the renormalization group ﬂow analysis in quantum ﬁeld
theory. For gravitation, considering an environment in
the early universe when the average energy per particle
was as high as the Planck mass, gravitation should be
considered as a strong coupling interaction. Notice that
a dilemma appears here that at the higher and higher en-
ergy scale as the coupling constants approach the closer
and closer to one, the validity of the ordinary perturba-
tive quantum ﬁeld theories which rely on the smallness of
coupling constants becomes the weaker and weaker. One
obvious consequence is that, even though we can deﬁne
the Planck scale as a clear point in parameter space, the
division between the ordinary physics and the Planck
scale quantum gravitational physics should really be a
buﬀer zone with fuzzy border line. A uniﬁed quantum
gravity theory containing the non-perturbative quantum
ﬁeld theory as an integral component should be needed
in this region but is missing at the moment.

A relation between Planck charges could also be shown,

mP

QmP =r ke

The Planck magnetic monopole, the Planck electric
charge and the Planck mass are proportional to each
other with the proportionality coeﬃcients being the
square roots of their strength constants.

Now let us consider the electric-magnetic charge quan-
tization relation that Dirac found by analyzing the mo-
tion of charge in the ﬁeld of magnetic monopole,[7]

Q · Qm = 2π · n, n ∈ Z

(22)

We show that combining the concepts of Planck
charges with Dirac’s electric-magnetic quantization rela-
tion produces interesting ﬁndings. Firstly, it is heuristic
to see what value the quantum number n should take if
both the electric and magnetic charges reach their Planck
values, by direct substitution,

QP · QmP = 2π · nP , n ∈ Z

• n = 0, no magnetic monopoles existed/exist at all;
• n = 1, a very narrow survival space at quite high

energy scales for magnetic monopoles exists.

Here we see a simplistic but powerful argument for the
scarcity of the magnetic monopoles in the universe.

The n = 1 narrow survival space for the magnetic
monopole is what we consider now. Solving for the mag-
netic monopole in terms of the electric charge from the
Dirac quantization relation, and set n = 1,

Qm =

2π

Q · n(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(n = 1) ⇒ Qm =

2π
Q

(26)

The value of the magnetic monopole is inversely propor-
tional to the value of the electric charge. The minimum
electric charge Q → e at the low energy end maps to a
magnetic monopole value greater than the Planck mag-
netic monopole which is forbidden, or unobservable.

Qm =

2π
e ≈

2π

(QP /11.706)

= 5.853QmP >QmP

(27)

As the renormalization group ﬂow brings up the electric
charge value with increasing energy scale, the magnetic
monopole decrease. This inverse relation is equivalently
expressed in terms of the coupling constants,

α · αm =

1
4

(28)

This relation is valid over a large span of energy scales
as long as neither of the two coupling constants breaks
the large value limit of one, the boundary of validity
of ordinary physics. The closer the physics dares run-
ning towards the Planck scale, the electric charge grows
the closer from minimum value e to the Planck charge
QP , and the magnetic monopole approach to a minimum
value limit,

(29)

Had magnetic monopoles really existed, this should be
the minimum eﬀect they bring to the physical experi-
ments. For it not to break the Planck magnetic monopole
ceiling Qm<QmP , the lowest electric charge is at

QmP = 2 ·

.

The smallness of nP = 2 is conceptually very impres-
sive. Planck charges are huge values which the electric
charge and magnetic monopole values should not exceed,
not to invalidate the current perturbative quantum ﬁeld
theory. That nP = 2 squeezes the survival space for
magnetic monopoles to only two choices:

1
2

QP <Q<QP ⇔

1
4

<α<1

We conclude that this range of value in terms of the
electric ﬁne structure constant is the hermitic Shangri-
La for the magnetic monopole, a remote but dreamy
paradise physicists have been sought for two centuries

where the magnetic monopoles are living their fairytale
life. There and only there is where physicists should go
and search.

V. Summary and Conclusion
Near a high energy scale characterized by the Planck
mass, the universal gravitation ceases being weak and de-
mands a uniﬁed treatment with other fundamental inter-
actions. The running tendency of the coupling constants
caused by the renormalization group ﬂow in perturbative
quantum ﬁeld theories demands that limits be speciﬁed
for various interactions to stop them from running into
the Planck scale where the perturbative quantum ﬁeld
theories themselves collapse besides that a uniﬁed the-
ory of all interactions is not yet at hand. These lim-
its become the conceptual foundation for the deﬁnition
of Planck charges. We show that the concepts can be
extended in a consistent and uniﬁed manner to include
Planck currents. They together form a set of boundary
markers signaling the buﬀer zone preventing the ordinary
physics below Planck scale from running into the sphere
of high energy quantum gravity physics.

As stated above, the Planck charges are the boundary
limits to ordinary physics. When applied to magnetic
monopole case obeying Dirac’s electric-magnetic charge
quantization relation, the maximum allowed Planck elec-
tric charge would mean a lower bound to the value
of magnetic monopole as half of the Planck magnetic
monopole. As the electric charge and magnetic charge
evolve inversely with energy scale, the electric charge
can not go lower than half of the Planck electric charge
for the magnetic charge not to touch the Planck mag-
netic monopole ceiling. Thus in terms of the value of
the electric ﬁne structure constant, the range 1
4 <α<1, is
the survival range for magnetic monopoles. Oue result
conﬁrms a similar conclusion in literature.[19]) This is
roughly about the energy scale of GUTs which is typi-
cally a few orders of magnitude lower the Planck mass.
We claim to have pointed out the location of the her-
mitic Shangri-La where the magnetic monopole are in-

5

habiting. Towards this direction further attempts should
be directed with hope, while eﬀorts at the low energy
end can be advised to be conceded. Such a conclusion
can provide discriminative directions to the century-long
project in search of magnetic monopoles.

Note that the curve of the running coupling constant
for magnetic monopole resembles that of quantum chro-
modynamics with asymptotic freedom.
It implies the
possibility of borrowing the concepts of quark conﬁne-
ment as one way of explanation for the diﬃculty of ﬁnd-
ing magnetic monopoles. It might be conjectured that
the strong coupling conﬁned magnetic monopole balls
might be a possible component for cosmological dark
matter. Some research attempts might be considered
relevant.[20]

In the above discussion, we have been considering that
all of the interactions reach the Planck scale and their
respective Planck values simultaneously. We also relied
on the electric ﬁne structure constant as the example the
running coupling constant with energy scale even though
at higher energy scales it can have larger theoretical em-
beddings. The number of diﬀerent GUT models are not
even small. Diﬀerent particle theory models can give
somewhat diﬀerent running curves. But the tendency
should be similar.
It is possible to discover more ac-
curate constrains than ours with suitable GUT models.
The validity of our result as discriminative, qualitative
direction to the eﬀorts in search of magnetic monopoles
will stand ﬁrm.
