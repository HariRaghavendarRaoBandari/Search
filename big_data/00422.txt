Colloidal shear thickening presents a signiÔ¨Åcant challenge because the macroscopic rheology be-
comes increasingly controlled by the microscopic details of short ranged particle interactions in
the shear thickening regime. Our measurements here of the Ô¨Årst normal stress diÔ¨Äerence over a
wide range of particle volume fraction elucidate the relative contributions from hydrodynamic lu-
brication and frictional contact forces, which have been debated. At moderate volume fractions we
Ô¨Ånd N1 < 0, consistent with hydrodynamic models, however at higher volume fractions and shear
stresses these models break down and we instead observe dilation (N1 > 0), indicating frictional
contact networks. Remarkably, there is no signature of this transition in the viscosity, instead this
change in the sign of N1 occurs while the shear thickening remains continuous. These results suggest
a scenario where shear thickening is driven primarily by the formation of frictional contacts, with
hydrodynamic forces playing a supporting role at lower concentrations. Motivated by this picture,
we introduce a simple model which combines these frictional and hydrodynamic contributions and
accurately Ô¨Åts the measured viscosity over a wide range of particle volume fraction and shear stress.

There is mounting evidence from recent experiments
[1, 2] and simulations [3] suggesting that contact fric-
tion plays a dominant role in colloidal shear thickening,
however this assertion is controversial because of con-
trary evidence. While friction-based models and simu-
lations capture the viscosity increase observed in exper-
iments, other experimental signatures, particularly the
stress anisotropy, are at odds with expectations for fric-
tional interactions [4].

Shear thickening, where a suspension‚Äôs viscosity Œ∑ =
œÉ/ ÀôŒ≥ increases with increasing shear stress œÉ (or shear
rate ÀôŒ≥), is important in a wide array of industrial pro-
cesses and applications, either something to be avoided
or a desired, engineered property [5‚Äì7]. Shear thickening
is observed in both granular suspensions, where the par-
ticle diameter d is generally d (cid:38) 10 ¬µm, and colloidal sus-
pensions, where d (cid:46) 10 ¬µm. In granular suspensions, the
evidence that friction drives shear thickening is well es-
tablished [8‚Äì16] but in colloidal suspensions shear thick-
ening is instead commonly attributed to diverging hydro-
dynamic lubrication forces, which lock particles together
in correlated ‚Äòhydroclusters‚Äô [17‚Äì21].

A key diÔ¨Äerence between friction and lubrication forces
lies in the stress anisotropy generated by these two types
of interactions. This diÔ¨Äerence is captured by the Ô¨Årst
normal stress diÔ¨Äerence N1 ‚â° œÉxx ‚àí œÉzz, where œÉij is the
stress tensor for a shear Ô¨Çow in the x direction with a
gradient along z. Simulations based on hydrodynamic
interactions show that shear-induced distortions of the
suspension microstructure and short ranged lubrication
forces drive N1 < 0 [7, 18, 19, 22]. Including repulsive
interactions or elastic particle deformations to these hy-
drodynamic models does not change the sign of N1 [23‚Äì
25], and N1 is predicted to become increasingly negative
as the particle concentration increases. In contrast, dila-

tancy (N1 > 0) is a well known feature of dense, frictional
granular materials [9, 26], reÔ¨Çecting the anisotropic na-
ture of the force chain network [27].

While proposed friction-based models for shear thick-
ening do not make explicit predictions for N1, at suÔ¨É-
ciently high volume fractions one expects frictional con-
tact networks to lead to dilation (N1 > 0), as in the gran-
ular case. Only a handful of experiments measure N1 in
shear thickening colloids, though most report N1 < 0
[4, 28‚Äì30], consistent with lubrication forces; the lone ex-
ception is a study using roughened particles [31]. Recent
experimental evidence for friction-driven colloidal shear
thickening focuses on the viscosity alone, either compar-
ing viscosity proÔ¨Åles to friction-based models [1] or using
shear-reversal techniques to separate contributions from
hydrodynamic and contact forces [2], and thus these ex-
periments do not address this discrepancy in the sign of
N1.

In this Letter we address this disagreement between
friction-based models and experiments. Detailing the be-
havior of both the viscosity Œ∑(œÉ, œÜ) and N1(œÉ, œÜ) over
a wide range of shear stresses and volume fractions in
colloidal silica spheres exhibiting continuous shear thick-
ening, we show that negative contributions to N1 from
lubrication forces can mask positive frictional contribu-
tions at moderate volume fractions, but at suÔ¨Éciently
high volume fractions and stresses, frictional interactions
become dominant and N1 transitions from negative to
positive. This highlights the need to include both lubri-
cation and friction to fully describe shear thickening at
moderate volume fractions, suggesting possible modiÔ¨Åca-
tions to purely friction-based models for shear thickening.
Here we work with unmodiÔ¨Åed d = 1.54 ¬µm silica
spheres (Bang Laboratories, Inc.
[33]) suspended in a
glycerol/water mixture (92% glycerol mass fraction). A

in (a) show the range of Œ∑r from T = 1‚ó¶C (upper bound) to T = 21‚ó¶C (lower bound) for œÜ ‚â• 0.52, all other quantities are
independent of T .

small amount of salt is added to screen electrostatic in-
teractions ([NaCl]= 0.001 mole/L), so that the Debye
screening length Œ∫‚àí1 = 7 nm is small compared to the
particle size. We prepare samples with volume fractions
0.28 ‚â§ œÜ ‚â§ 0.58 from a concentrated stock suspension
with œÜstk = 0.58, which we determine from confocal
imaging and particle locating in samples that have been
index matched and diluted by a known ratio. Our rela-
tive uncertainty in œÜ due to uncertainty in d and particle
locating errors is approximately 3%, e.g. œÜstk = 0.58 ¬±
0.02.

Rheology is performed under steady shear using an
Anton-Paar MCR302 with a R = 12.5 mm radius cone-
plate tool. In this geometry, N1 can be measured from
the axial force N1 = 2Fz/œÄR2. In order to access large
shear stresses at all volume fractions over limited range
of shear rates, we perform stress sweeps at Ô¨Åxed temper-
atures between T = 1 ‚ó¶C and T = 35 ‚ó¶C to adjust the
viscosity of the suspending Ô¨Çuid between Œ∑f = 1.7 Pa s
to Œ∑f = 0.107 Pa s. For œÜ ‚â§ 0.52, changing Œ∑f has no im-
pact on either the relative viscosity Œ∑r(œÉ) = Œ∑(œÉ)/Œ∑f or
N1(œÉ), and thus on the onset stress for shear thickening.
At higher œÜ there is a slight increase in the shear thick-
ening with increasing Œ∑f , though this variation is small
compared to the variation between samples at diÔ¨Äerent
œÜ. At all œÜ both Œ∑r(œÉ) and N1(œÉ) are reversible, with
no observable hysteresis in repeated up and down stress
sweeps. Similarly, we do not observe time dependence at
Ô¨Åxed œÉ, indicating that the Ô¨Çow curves in Figure 1 reÔ¨Çect

steady-state suspension properties. See the Supplemen-
tal Material for additional details [32].

The relative viscosity Œ∑r(œÉ) [Fig. 1(a)] exhibits features
characteristic of typical shear thickening colloidal suspen-
sions [5, 7]. At low œÉ there is mild shear thinning, fol-
lowed by a plateau at a value Œ∑N (œÜ), which we identify as
the high-shear Newtonian plateau (see the Supplemen-
tal Materials [32]). As the stress is further increased,
the viscosity begins to increase and then plateaus at a
higher value Œ∑ST S(œÜ). The Newtonian plateau viscosity
increases with volume fraction as Œ∑N (œÜ) = (1 ‚àí œÜ/œÜ0)‚àí2
with œÜ0 = 0.711 ¬± 0.007 [Fig. 2(a)], in good agreement
with previous measurements of the high-shear viscosity
in hard-sphere colloids [7, 34]. We can Ô¨Åt the shear
thickened plateau viscosity to the same form Œ∑ST S(œÜ) =
(1 ‚àí œÜ/œÜm)‚àí2 yielding œÜm = 0.592 ¬± 0.006. Distinct, di-
verging branches for the Newtonian and shear thickened
viscosity plateaus are observed in other systems, though
our measured œÜm is slightly larger than values reported
in previous studies[1, 30]. Though both Œ∑N and Œ∑ST S
increase with œÜ, the shear thickening onset stress is inde-
pendent of œÜ, again consistent with previous experiments
[1, 30, 35, 36].
To characterize the steepness of the shear thickening,
we Ô¨Åt the viscosity increase to Œ∑r ‚àù œÉŒ≤. The onset of
discontinuous shear thickening (DST) is deÔ¨Åned by Œ≤ =
1, which implies a steady viscosity increases at a Ô¨Åxed
shear rate, and Œ≤ < 1 corresponds to continuous shear
thickening. In our suspensions Œ≤ increases monotonically

with œÜ up to Œ≤ = 0.95 ¬± 0.05 at œÜ = 0.58, approaching
the DST onset.

While the transition to DST occurs at approximately
œÜ = 0.58, N1(œÉ, œÜ) reveals a transition elaborated below
that is not evident in Œ∑r [Fig. 1(b)] . For œÜ ‚â§ 0.52, N1 ‚âà
0 for œÉ (cid:46) 100 Pa, then drops below zero and becomes
increasingly negative as œÉ is increased. The decrease in
N1 becomes more pronounced as œÜ is increased up to
œÜ = 0.52. At higher volume fractions, N1(œÉ) initially
decreases below zero as before, but as œÉ increases further
N1(œÉ) reverses direction, crosses zero at a shear stress œÉc
and becomes positive.

Simulations based on lubrication hydrodynamics pre-
dict N1 < 0 and that N1 should scale linearly with ÀôŒ≥
in the high shear limit [19, 37], so that the dimension-
less Ô¨Årst normal stress coeÔ¨Écient Œ•1 ‚â° ‚àíN1/Œ∑f ÀôŒ≥ ap-
proaches a stress-independent constant. Below œÜ = 0.52,
where N1 remains negative, we Ô¨Ånd that Œ•1 is indeed
stress-independent above œÉ ‚âà 100 Pa, while below this
stress we cannot resolve N1 [Fig. 1(c)]. The average value
Œ•1,ST S(œÜ) increases monotonically with œÜ. An empirical

initially proposed to capture simulation results [37], was
shown to Ô¨Åt experimental results for œÜ ‚â§ 0.52 with K1 =
0.177 ¬± 0.022 and œÜmax = œÜm obtained from Œ∑ST S(œÜ)
[30]. Our results for œÜ ‚â§ 0.52 can be Ô¨Åt using this same
expression [Fig. 2(b)], with a nearly identical coeÔ¨Écient
K1 = 0.14 ¬± 0.01.

At higher volume fractions Œ•1(œÉ) is no longer stress-
independent, but instead changes sign as the suspensions
become dilatant. As œÜ increases, the crossover stress œÉc
decreases, in contrast to the shear thickening onset stress
which remains independent of œÜ. Below œÉc, we can iden-
tify a plateau in Œ•1 over a limited range of œÉ. This initial
plateau follows Eq. (1) up to œÜ = 0.56, even though Œ•1(œÉ)
eventually drops below zero. At œÜ = 0.58, the stress
ratio Œ± = N1/œÉ is approximately constant in the high-
stress limit [Fig. 1(d)], consistent with a simple geometric
model for force chains [27].
To characterize the stress ratio in the high-shear limit,
we deÔ¨Åne Œ±ST S(œÜ), taking the average over œÉ ‚â• 2500 Pa.
Below œÜ = 0.52, where N1 remains negative, Œ±ST S
slightly decreases with increasing œÜ. Noting that Œ•1 can
be rewritten as Œ•1 = ‚àí(N1/œÉ)Œ∑r = ‚àíŒ±Œ∑r, we see that
the singular term in Eq. (1) can be solely ascribed to the
viscosity divergence. Thus, as long the stress ratio Œ±
remains bounded, Ô¨Åts to Eq. (1) are guaranteed to give
the same œÜmax = œÜm where Œ∑ST S diverges, but does not
imply that N1 and Œ∑r are necessarily linked.
If lubri-
cation forces drive the rise in Œ∑ST S, N1 should become
increasingly negative as œÜ ‚Üí œÜm. Instead, N1 changes
dramatically and becomes positive prior to reaching œÜm,
revealing a lack of coupling between the viscosity and N1.

Positive values of N1 suggest that frictional forces are
present and become dominant as œÜ ‚Üí œÜm. Motivated
by this, we Ô¨Åt Œ∑r(œÉ, œÜ) using a recently proposed friction-
based model [1, 15]. The model assumes Œ∑r(œÜ) is con-
trolled by two distinct divergences, one at œÜ = œÜ0 for
frictionless contacts and a second divergence at a friction-
dependent œÜm < œÜ0, giving the two branches Œ∑ST S and
Œ∑N shown in Fig. 2(a). The full Ô¨Çow curves are given by

where œÜc(œÉ) = f œÜm + (1 ‚àí f )œÜ0 interpolates between
the two maximum volume fractions and f ‚àà [0, 1] repre-
sents the fraction of frictional contacts. In this model,
contacts become frictional when the compressive force
between neighbors exceeds a repulsive stabilizing force
Frep. While the precise form of f = f (œÉ, œÜ) depends on
the microstructure and the local contact force distribu-
tion, we Ô¨Årst adopt a simple ansatz f (œÉ) = e‚àíœÉ‚àó/œÉ. This
form is also used in [1], which they motivate by assuming
an exponential contact force distribution and counting

œÜ [Fig. 3(b)].

To understand the regime where fmax < 1, we posit
the formation of enduring frictional contacts requires not
only temporary local stresses exceeding œÉ‚àó, but also a
conÔ¨Åning force to maintain these contacts.At moderate
œÜ this many-body conÔ¨Ånement could be provided by hy-
drodynamic lubrication forces, reminiscent of the ‚Äòhydro-
cluster‚Äô model. In this speculative scenario, shear thick-
ening is driven by the formation of frictional contacts
within hydrocluster-like structures, though the fraction
of frictional contacts would be limited by the size of these
clusters so that fmax < 1. Since frictional contacts are
conÔ¨Åned within these Ô¨Ånite clusters, there are no sys-
tem spanning force chains and the normal stress diÔ¨Äer-
ence is dominated by lubrication forces, giving N1 < 0.
At some œÜperc < œÜm these clusters span the system so
that fmax ‚âà 1 and frictional contact networks percolate
throughout the system, driving the transition to N1 > 0.
The scenario proposed here bridges competing friction-
driven and lubrication-driven explanations for colloidal
shear thickening. At moderate concentrations, hydrody-
namic forces distort the microstructure and bring parti-
cles together, consistent with previous experiments where
hydrocluster-like structures have been observed [21] and
negative values of N1 directly linked to hydrodynamic
stresses [4]. However, the viscosity increase is ultimately
driven by the formation of frictional contacts within these
clusters, consistent with recent experimental evidence for
friction driven shear thickening [1, 2]. This scenario dif-
fers from proposed mechanisms for the onset of DST in
granular suspensions [8, 9].
Instead of dilation driving
shear thickening, both dilation and shear thickening are
separate consequences of frictional interactions. Dilation
requires system-spanning frictional contacts and hence
high volume fractions, while shear thickening can result
from non-system-spanning frictional contacts and hence
occurs over a wider range of volume fractions.

The transition in the sign of N1 observed here is qual-
itatively similar to results with roughened silica spheres
[31], where the onset of dilation at œÜ = 0.43 also precedes
the transition to DST at œÜ = 0.455. Both transitions oc-
cur at lower volume fractions, which we would expect as
enhanced roughness should increase the particle friction
and decrease œÜm; which may also explain the diÔ¨Äerence
between values in previous experiments [1, 30]. Recent
simulations which include both lubrication and frictional
interactions show a similar transition in the sign of N1,
with N1 (cid:46) 0 at œÜ = 0.5 and 0.53, but N1 > 0 at œÜ = 0.55
[3]. Other simulations, which also include lubrication
and friction but only explore moderate volume fractions
œÜ ‚â§ 0.45, Ô¨Ånd that friction weakly increases N1 but over-
all N1 remains negative [38, 39], again consistent with
our results. Normal stress diÔ¨Äerences have the potential
to serve as a sensitive diagnostic of particle interactions,
particularly the presence of frictional interactions. Our
results highlight the need for additional studies to de-

the fraction of local forces above Frep, which sets the
threshold stress œÉ‚àó ‚àù Frep/d2.

This friction-based model Ô¨Åts our results at high vol-
ume fractions, where we Ô¨Ånd N1 > 0, exceptionally well
[Fig. 1(a)]. Here we hold œÜm = 0.592 Ô¨Åxed, but leave
both œÉ‚àó and œÜ0 as adjustable parameters. Allowing œÜ0
to vary accounts for scatter in Œ∑N (œÜ), though the Ô¨Åt-
ted values agree with œÜ0 = 0.71 within uncertainty. At
lower volume fractions, where we Ô¨Ånd N1 < 0, there is no
change in the shear thickening onset nor any qualitative
change in the viscosity proÔ¨Åle Œ∑r(œÉ), suggesting this same
model can be applied. Indeed, Figure 1 shows that even
though N1 is strongly negative for œÜ = 0.52, dropping to
as low as -700 Pa, this friction-based model still captures
the shear thickening.

The model Ô¨Åts begin to overshoot the amount of shear
thickening below œÜ (cid:46) 0.5 [Fig. 3(a)]. Though the abso-
lute magnitude of this overshoot is small, this discrep-
ancy can be seen in the limiting viscosities, where the
relative diÔ¨Äerence between measured and Ô¨Åtted values for
‚àÜŒ∑ ‚â° Œ∑ST S ‚àí Œ∑N increases with decreasing œÜ [Fig. 2(a)].
We attribute this disagreement to our simple ansatz for
f (œÉ), where f ‚Üí 1 for œÉ (cid:29) œÉ‚àó, independent of œÜ. While
we might expect this close to œÜm, in dilute suspensions
we expect the Ô¨Çow to be dominated by momentary col-
lisions as opposed to enduring contacts.
If we instead
take f (œÉ, œÜ) = fmax(œÜ)e‚àíœÉ‚àó/œÉ with 0 ‚â§ fmax ‚â§ 1, we
can Ô¨Åt Œ∑(œÉ, œÜ) over our full range of œÜ. We Ô¨Ånd that

this point fmax monotonically decreases with decreasing

[32] See Supplemental Material [link will be inserted by pub-
lisher] for additional details concerning the dependence
of Œ∑r and N1 on temperature, P¬¥eclet number and time, a
comparison between values of Œ∑N measured here and in
previous experiments, and additional test verifying the
accuracy and robustness of the N1 measurements.

[33] Certain instruments and materials are identiÔ¨Åed in this
paper to adequately specify the experimental details.
Such identiÔ¨Åcation does not imply recommendation by
the National Institute of Standards and Technology nor
does it imply the materials are necessarily the best avail-
able for the purpose.
