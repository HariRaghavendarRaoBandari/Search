ON THE BOUNDEDNESS OF SLC SURFACES OF GENERAL TYPE

CHRISTOPHER D. HACON AND S ´ANDOR J KOV ´ACS

The purpose of this note is to give a new proof of Alexeev’s boundedness result for stable
surfaces which is independent of the base ﬁeld and to highlight some important consequences
of this result.

Let k be an algebraically closed ﬁeld, an slc model (X, B) is a projective semi-log canonical
pair such that KX + B is ample (see Deﬁnition 1.3 below). The main result of this paper is
the following.
Theorem 1 (Alexeev). Fix a constant υ > 0 and a DCC set C ⊂ [0, 1] ∩ Q. Then there
exists an integer r > 0 such that for any algebraically closed ﬁeld k and any two dimensional
slc model (X, B) deﬁned over k with coeﬀ(B) ⊆ C and (KX + B)2 = υ, r(KX + B) is very
ample.

Remark 0.1. This result was originally proved by V. Alexeev in a series of papers ([Ale89],
[Ale93], [Ale94] and [AM04]). The results there are stated for surfaces deﬁned over a ﬁxed
algebraically closed ﬁeld (of any characteristc) however, as pointed out to us by Alexeev, they
actually hold independently of the ﬁeld. We believe that this was known to some experts,
however there are some subtleties in Alexeev’s arguments that make the proof of the results
over an arbitrary ﬁeld not entirely routine. In this paper we propose an alternative proof
which we believe simpliﬁes and makes more transparent Alexeev’s original approach. The
main diﬀerences are: A substantial simpliﬁcation of the arguments needed from [Ale93]; The
use the eﬀective Matsusaka results of [Ter99] and [dCF15] (instead of the original papers of
Matsusaka and Koll´ar); The use of ultraproducts (cf. [Sch10] and [BHMM12]) to simplify
some of the arguments of [Ale94]. Of course most arguments are heavily inﬂuenced by
[Ale94].

The following result, which is of independent interest, is a key step in the proof of Theorem 1.
Theorem 2. Fix a DCC set C. Let V = {(KX + B)2} where (X, B) is a two dimensional
slc model (X, B) deﬁned over k, an algebraically closed ﬁeld, with coeﬀ(B) ⊆ C. Then V is
also a DCC set. In particular, there exists a number δ > 0, depending only on C, such that
if 0 < v ∈ V, then v ≥ δ.
Corollary 3. Fix constants ε, υ > 0 and a DCC set C ⊂ [0, 1] ∩ Q. Then the set of all
two dimensional ε log canonical pairs (X, B) deﬁned over k with coeﬀ(B) ⊆ C, KX + B nef
and big and (KX + B)2 ≤ υ is degree bounded, i.e., there exists a constant d > 0 such that

for any pair (X, B) as above there is a very ample divisor H on X such that H 2 ≤ d and
Bred · H ≤ d.

We have the following interesting application which should allow the construction of mod-

uli spaces of (semi-log-canonical) canonically polarized surfaces for p ≫ 0.
Theorem 4. Fix a constant υ > 0 and a DCC set C ⊂ [0, 1] ∩ Q. Then there exists a
number p0 > 0 such that if X → S is a projective morphism with connected ﬁbers from a
3-fold to a smooth curve deﬁned over an algebraically closed ﬁeld of characteristic p > p0,
and (X, B) is a pair such that coeﬀ(B) ⊆ C and for a general s ∈ S the ﬁber (Xs, Bs) is log
canonical and KXs + Bs is ample with (KXs + Bs)2 = υ, then there exist a proper, separable
ﬁnite morphism S′ → S, a projective morphism f ′ : X ′ → S′, and a pair (X ′, B′) such that

1. PRELIMINARIES

1.A. Deﬁnitions
We follow the deﬁnitions of [Kol13b] (in particular for discrepancies, terminal, klt and lc
pairs). A pair (X, B) consists of a variety X and an eﬀective Q-divisor B on X. The
set of coeﬃcients appearing in the irreducible decomposition B = Pr
i=1 biBi is denoted by
coeﬀ(B) = {bi|i = 1, . . . , r} and we let Bred = Pr
i=1 Bi. Recall that a pair (X, B) is ε-klt
(resp. ε-lc) if a(X, B) > ε− 1 (resp. a(X, B) ≥ ε− 1) where a(X, B) is the total discrepancy
of (X, B), in particular bi < 1 − ε (resp. bi ≤ 1 − ε).
We say that C ⊂ R is a DCC set if given any non-increasing sequence (ai)i∈N of elements
of C then (ai)i∈N is constant for all i ≫ 0. The typical example is I = {1 − 1
m|m ∈ N}. We
let I+ = {0}∪ {i =Pl
m , m ∈ N, f ∈ I+ ∩ [0, 1]}.
It is well known that I is a DCC set if and only if and only if D(I) is a DCC set. Recall the
following (see e.g., [Ale94, 2.7]).

p=1 ip|i1, . . . , il ∈ I} and D(I) = {a = m−1+f

Lemma 1.1 (Shokurov’s Log Adjunction Formula). Let (X, S +B) be a log canonical surface

pair where B =P biBi and S is a prime divisor with normalization ν : Sν → S, then
where the coeﬃcients of Diﬀ Sν (B) are 1 or of the form (n − 1 +P aibi)/n ∈ [0, 1] for some
n, ai ∈ N. In particular, coeﬀ(Diﬀ Sν (B)) ⊆ D(I) if coeﬀ(B) ⊆ I.

(KX + S + B)|Sν = KSν + Diﬀ Sν (B) = KSν + Diﬀ(0)Sν + B|Sν

For later use we recall the following elementary observation.

Lemma 1.2. Let (X, S + B) be a log canonical surface pair where S is a prime divisor with
normalization ν : Sν → S. Then for any 1 ≥ λ ≥ 0 we have
Proof. Let B =P biBi. It suﬃces to show that (n−1+λP aibi)/n ≥ λ(n−1+P aibi)/n. (cid:3)
For a, b ∈ R set a ∨ b = max{a, b} and a ∧ b = min{a, b}. Similarly, for A = P aiAi and
A′ =P a′

i)Ai. We say that
a pair (X, B) has simple normal crossings or is an snc pair if X is smooth and the support
of B consists of smooth divisors meeting transversely.

iAi R-divisors set A ∨ A′ =P(ai ∨ a′

i)Ai and A ∧ A′ =P(ai ∧ a′

(KX + S + λB)|Sν ≥ KSν + λDiﬀSν (B).

Deﬁnition 1.3. A scheme X is called demi-normal if it is seminormal, S2 and G1 or equiv-
alently if it is S2 and its codimension 1 points are either regular points or nodes (cf. [Kol13b,

The pair (X, B) is called semi-log canonical or slc if X is demi-normal, KX + B is Q-

5.1,10.14]). Let X be a demi-normal scheme with normalization π : eX → X and conductors
D ⊂ X and eD ⊂ eX. Let B ⊂ X be an eﬀective Q-divisor whose support does not contain
any irreducible component of D and eB ⊂ eX the divisorial part of π−1(B).
Cartier and (eX, eB + eD) is log canonical. An slc model (or semi log canonical model ) is a
Let π : X → U be a projective morphism of normal varieties, then by deﬁnition π∗OX (D) =
π∗OX (⌊D⌋). Given an R-divisor D on a normal projective variety X, the volume of D is
deﬁned as

projective pair (X, B) which is slc and such that KX + B is ample.

vol(D) = lim
m→∞

h0(OX(⌊mD⌋))

.

mn/n!

If D is nef, then vol(D) = Ddim X . Note that vol(λD) = λdim X vol(D) for any λ > 0.
It is easy to see that if f : X → Y is a morphism of normal projective varieties, then
vol(D) ≤ vol(f∗D) and if E is an R-Cartier divisor on Y such that D − f ∗E ≥ 0 is f -
excepional, then vol(E) = vol(D).
Let X be a quasi-projective variety then a b-divisor B over X is given by a collection of
divisors BX ′ on X ′ for any birational morphism X ′ → X with the property that if X ′′ → X
is another birational morphism and ν is a valuation corresponding to a divisor on X ′ and
X ′′, then multν(BX ′) = multν(BX ′′). In other words a b-divisor over X is deﬁned by its
multiplicity along any divisor over X. Similarly one deﬁnes R-b-divisors etc.
Let (X, B) be a pair. Then typical examples of R-b-divisors are as follows.
(1) the discrepancy b-divisor, A = AB is deﬁned by the equation

KX ′ = ν∗(KX + B) + AB,X ′

for any birational morphism ν : X ′ → X,

(2) the b-divisor L = LB is deﬁned by the equation

KX ′ + LB,X ′ = ν∗(KX + B) + EB,X ′

where LB,X ′ and EB,X ′ are eﬀective with no common components, for any birational
morphism ν : X ′ → X,
and multE(M) = 1 otherwise.

(3) the b-divisor M = MB is deﬁned by multE(M) = multE(B) if E is a divisor on X

We have (cf. [HMX13, 5.3]):

Proposition 1.4. Let (X, B) be a simple normal crossings projective pair, f : Y → X a log
resolution of (X, B), and g : X → Z a birational projective morphism such that (Z, g∗B) has
simple normal crossings. Then

exceptional.

(1) vol(KX + B) = vol(KY + Γ) for any R-divisor Γ such that Γ − LB,Y ≥ 0 is f -
(2) vol(KX + B) = vol(KX + Θ) where Θ = B ∧ Lg∗B,X .

Deﬁnition 1.5. We say that a set of varieties X is degree bounded if there exists a constant
m > 0 such that for each X ∈ X there is a very ample divisor H on X with H dim(X) < m. A

set of pairs P is degree bounded if there exists an integer m > 0 such that for each (X, B) ∈ P
there is a very ample divisor H on X with H dim(X) < m and H dim(X)−1 · Bred < m. A set of
pairs B is log birationally degree bounded if there exists a degree bounded set of pairs P such
that for any (X, B) ∈ B there exists a pair (Z, D) ∈ X and a birational map f : Z 99K X
such that Dred contains the strict transform of Bred and all f -exceptional divisors.

1.B. Ultraproducts
We brieﬂy recall a few results about ultraﬁlters and ultraproducts that will be needed in what
follows. The interested reader may consult [Sch10] and [BHMM12] for more background.

We ﬁx U a non-principal ultraﬁlter on N for the sequel. So U is a non-empty collection of

inﬁnite subsets of N such that

(1) if A ⊂ B ⊂ N and A ∈ U, then B ∈ U,
(2) if A, B ∈ U, then A ∩ B ∈ U, and
(3) for any A ⊂ N, either A or N \ A are in U.
We say that a property P (m) holds for almost all m ∈ N if {m ∈ N|P (m) holds} ∈
U. Let (Am)m∈N be a sequence of rings then the ultraproduct [Am] is deﬁned by [Am] :=
(cid:0)Qm∈N Am(cid:1) / ∼ where ∼ is the equivalence relation deﬁned by (am) ∼ (bm) iﬀ am = bm
for almost all m ∈ N.
[am] ∈ [Am] denotes the equivalence class corresponding to the
If, for
sequence (am)m∈N. Note that am only needs to be deﬁned for almost all m ∈ N.
almost all m ∈ N, the Am are reduced (resp. ﬁelds), then so is [Am]. Given a sequence of
homomorphisms of rings fm : Am → Bm then [fm] : [Am] → [Bm] is a homomorphism of
rings deﬁned by [fm]([am]) = [fm(am)].
Suppose now that Lm is a sequence of ﬁelds and k = [Lm]. For any ﬁxed integer n > 0,

we deﬁne the ring of internal polynomials

k[x1, . . . , xn]int = [Lm[x1, . . . , xn]] .

Note that the name is misleading as the elements of k[x1, . . . , xn]int are not necessarily
polynomials. There exists a natural embedding

k[x1, . . . , xn] ֒→ k[x1, . . . , xn]int

whose image is the set of elements g = [gm] ∈ k[x1, . . . , xn]int of bounded degree (i.e., such
that there exists an integer d with deg(gm) ≤ d for almost all m ∈ N). For an ideal
a ⊆ k[x1, ..., xN ] we put aint := a · k[x1, . . . , xn]int.

We have the following.

Theorem 1.6 ([vdDS84, Thm. 1.1]). The extension k[x1, . . . , xn] ֒→ k[x1, . . . , xn]int is faith-
fully ﬂat. In particular, for an ideal a ⊆ k[x1, . . . , xn], aint ∩ k[x1, . . . , xn] = a.

It follows from this theorem that ideals of k[x1, . . . , xn]int generated in bounded degree are
of the form [am] for a sequence of ideals am ⊆ Lm[x1, . . . , xn], which is generated in bounded
degree.
Given the ﬁelds Lm for m ∈ N and assuming the above constructions, the symbol [Xm]
stands for equivalence classes of sequences of schemes Xm of ﬁnite type over Lm with respect
[Xm] ∼ [Ym] iﬀ Xm = Ym for almost all m ∈ N. This [Xm] is
to the equivalence relation:
called an internal scheme over k. An internal morphism [fm] is deﬁned by (the equivalence
class of) a sequence of morphisms fm : Xm → Ym where as usual [fm] ∼ [gm] iﬀ fm = gm for

4

almost all m ∈ N. Similarly, an internal coherent sheaf on an internal scheme [Xm], denoted
by the symbol [Fm], is deﬁned as an equivalence class of sequences of coherent sheaves Fm
on Xm by the usual equivalence relation, [Fm] ∼ [Gm] iﬀ Fm ≃ Gm for almost all m ∈ N,
where Fm and Gm are coherent sheaves on Xm for almost all m ∈ N.
Using the above deﬁnition, we have a functor X 7→ Xint from separated schemes of ﬁnite
type over k to internal schemes, which when X is aﬀne, is deﬁned as follows: let X ֒→ AN
k be
a closed embedding deﬁned by the ideal a ⊂ k[x1, ..., xN ]. As observed above aint = [am] for
an appropriate sequence of ideals, and then we deﬁne Xm in AN
Lm by the ideal am (it is enough
to do this for almost all m ∈ N). Now we set Xint := [Xm]. A similar construction applies to
morphisms (for details see [BHMM12, pp. 1468-1469]) which implies that the above deﬁned
Xint is independent of the embedding we chose at the beginning and hence the construction
is functorial. By patching on an open cover of X we obtain Xint in the general case as well
as the same for morphisms.

Similarly to the functor X 7→ Xint one may also deﬁne a functor F 7→ Fint from co-
herent sheaves on X to internal coherent sheaves on Xint. The construction is relatively
straightforward; for details and basic properties see [BHMM12, pp. 1471-1472].

Notice that since the construction of the functor X 7→ Xint is based on the deﬁning ideal
sheaf of X and hence for a divisor D ⊂ X, the internal subscheme Dint ⊂ Xint is a divisor with
corresponding divisorial sheaf OXint(Dint) ≃ [OXm(Dm)]. In other words, for a divisor, the
corresponding internal divisor may be obtained either as an internal scheme or an internal
coherent sheaf. By [BHMM12, 3.5(i)] Cartier divisors correspond to Cartier divisors. An
internal pair (X, D) consists of an internal scheme X and an internal Q-divisor D ⊂ X. For
a pair (X, D) over k, we will use the notation (X, D)int := (Xint, Dint).

Lm with degree ≤ d. For any open aﬃne subset U ⊂ PN

Proposition 1.7. Fix d > 0 and let Lm be a sequence of ﬁelds. Let Xm be a sequence of
projective varieties deﬁned over Lm of bounded degree and dimension for almost all m ∈ N.
Then there exists a projective variety X deﬁned over k = [Lm] such that Xint = [Xm].
Proof. Since the Xm have bounded degree and dimension (for almost all m ∈ N), we may
assume that there are ﬁxed integers d, N > 0 such that for almost all m ∈ N, Xm is
embedded in PN
k let Uint = [Um] be
the corresponding internal scheme. Then [Xm ∩ Um] = (X U )int for some closed subscheme
X U ⊆ U by Theorem 1.6. Glueing the various X U we obtain the required closed subscheme
X ⊆ PN
k .
Lemma 1.8. Let X ⊂ PN
Xint = [Xm] and Lint = [Lm], then Lm is semiample for almost all m ∈ N.
Proof. Since L is semiample, there is an integer r > 0 such that L ⊗r deﬁnes a morphism
φ : X → PM
(1)], it
follows that L ⊗r
(1)) for almost all m ∈ N (where (φ)int = [φm]) by [BHMM12,
3.5(iii)]. Thus Lm is semiample for almost all m ∈ N.
(cid:3)
Lemma 1.9. Let (X, B) be a log canonical pair projective over k = ¯k = [Lm] and let
ν : X 99K Y be a good minimal model (resp. log canonical model), then (Xm, Bm) is a log
canonical pair projective over Lm and νm : Xm 99K Ym is a good minimal model (resp. log
canonical model) for (Xm, Bm) for almost all m ∈ N, where νint = [νm], Yint = [Ym] and
Bint = [Bm].

m → Xm is a log resolution for almost all m ∈ N and (KX ′/X )int = [KX ′

Proof. Since r(KX + B) is Cartier, so is r(KXm + Bm) for almost all m ∈ N by [BHMM12,
3.5(i)]. Let µ : X ′ → X be a log resolution of (X, B), then following [BHMM12, Proof of 4.1],
µm : X ′
m/Xm]. Since
the coeﬃcients of AX ′ = KX ′ − µ∗(KX + B) are ≥ −1, the same holds for the coeﬃcients of
m(KXm + Bm) for almost all m ∈ N (cf. [BHMM12, §3]). We only discuss
AX ′
the case of good minimal models (the other case is very similar). By assumption KY + BY
is semiample where BY = ν∗B. By Lemma 1.8, KYm + BYm is semiample for almost all
m ∈ N. Let p : W → X and q : W → Y resolve ν, then p∗(KX + B) ≥ q∗(KY + BY ) where
the inequality is strict along ν-exceptional divisors on Y . But then, if pm : Wm → Xm and
qm : Wm → Ym are the corresponding morphisms, we have p∗
m(KYm + BYm)
where the inequality is strict along νm-exceptional divisors on Ym.
(cid:3)

m(KXm + Bm) ≥ q∗

1.C. Effective Matsusaka and birational boundedness
We begin by recalling the following eﬀective version of Matsusaka’s theorem and a vanishing
theorem due to di Cerbo, Fanelli and Terakawa.

Theorem 1.10. Let X be a smooth surface and D be a big and nef Cartier divisor. Let
q0 := (2vol(KX) + 9)/(p − 1), then H i(OX (KX + qD)) = 0 for all i > 0 and q > q0.
Proof. See [Ter99] and [dCF15, 5.7].

(cid:3)

Theorem 1.11. Let X be a smooth surface and D be a big and nef Cartier divisor. Let
l = D2 − 5 (resp. l = D2 − 9) with l ≥ 0 then if |KX + D| has a base point at x ∈ X (resp.
|KX + D| does not separate points x, y ∈ X) then
(1) If X is not of general type nor quasi-elliptic of Kodaira dimension 1, then there
exists a curve C ⊂ X containing x (resp. containing one of the points x, y) such that
D · C < 2 (resp. D · C < 4),
(2) If X is of general type with D2 > vol(KX) + 6 (resp. D2 > vol(KX) + 9) or is quasi-
elliptic of Kodaira dimension 1 then there exists a curve C ⊂ X containing x (resp.
containing one of the points x, y) such that D · C ≤ 7 (resp. D · C ≤ 17).

Proof. See the main theorem of [Ter99] and [dCF15, 4.9, 4.11].

(cid:3)

Corollary 1.12. Let X be a normal surface and D a nef and big Cartier divisor such that
D2 ≥ vol(KX ), then |KX + qD| deﬁnes a birational morphism for any q ≥ 18.
Proof. Let µ : X ′ → X be a resolution and D′ = µ∗D. Pick a general point x ∈ X ′ (resp.
general points x, y ∈ X ′). If C is a curve on X ′ containing x (resp. containing x or y), then
qD′ · C ≥ q ≥ 18 and (qD′)2 = (qD)2 ≥ vol(KX) + 10. By Theorem 1.11, x is not a base
point of |KX ′ + D′| and |KX ′ + D′| separates x and y.

(cid:3)

We will also need the following result which is analogous to [HMX13, 3.1].

Theorem 1.13. Fix A ∈ N, δ > 0. Let (X, B) be a log canonical surface such that the
coeﬃcients of B are ≥ δ, vol(q(KX + B)) ≤ A and |KX + q(KX + B)| is birational for some
q > 0, then (X, B) is log birationally degree bounded.

Proof. The proof follows [HMX13, 3.1]. For the convenience of the reader we include a
sketch which highlights the main changes necessary to avoid the use of Kawamata-Viehweg
vanishing.

6

By a standard reduction (cf. [HMX13, 3.1]) we may assume that X is smooth and |KX +
q(KX + B)| induces a morphism φ : X → Z, i.e., |KX + q(KX + B)| = |M| + E where |M|
is basepoint-free. Let H be a very ample Cartier divisor on Z so that M = φ∗H. It suﬃces
to show that H 2 and φ∗Bred · H are bounded from above.

Clearly

H 2 = M 2 = vol(M) ≤ vol(KX + q(KX + B)) ≤ (q + 1)2vol(KX + B) ≤ 22A.

Let D0 be the sum of the components of B that are not φ-exceptional. Note that if G ∈ |M|,
then there is an eﬀective Q-divisor C such that

(1.C.1)
Let α = 2A + 10. Since B ≥ 0 and q > 0,

δD0 + G + C ∼Q (q + 1)(KX + B).

vol(q(KX + B)) ≥ vol(KX + B) ≥ vol(KX)

and so α ≥ 2vol(KX) + 10. Then

A.

Here the ﬁrst (in)equality follows as G ∼ M = φ∗H, the second is trivial, the third by Lemma
1.14 below, the fourth by (1.C.1), and the ﬁfth since 1+(1/δ+2α)(q+1)
≤ 2(1 + 1/δ + 2α). (cid:3)
Lemma 1.14. Let X be a normal surface, M a Cartier divisor such that |M| is base point
free and the induced map φ = φ|M | : X → Z is birational. Let L = 2αM for some integer
α ≥ vol(KX) + 10 and D be a sum of distinct prime divisors, then

q

D · L ≤ 4vol(KX + D + L).

Proof. By standard reductions, we may assume that (X, D) is an snc pair and the components
of D are disjoint and not φ-exceptional (cf. [HMX13, 3.2]). Now consider the short exact
sequence

0 → OX (KX + mL) → OX (KX + mL + D) → OD(KD + mL|D) → 0

(1.C.3)
Since R1φ∗OX(KX + mL) = 0 by the Grauert-Riemenschneider vanishing theorem (see
[Kol13b, 10.4] for a version that applies here) using the projection formula and Serre van-
ishing, it follows that

H 1(OX (KX + mL)) = H 1(φ∗OX (KX + mL)) = H 1(φ∗OX (KX) ⊗ OZ(mH)) = 0

for all m ≫ 0 and hence

(1.C.4)

H 0(OX (KX + mL + D)) → H 0(OD(KD + mL|D))

is surjective. We now claim that
Claim 1.15. It follows that h0(OX(KX + L)) > 0 and no component of D is contained in
the base locus of |KX + αM + D|.

y

Proof. Since α ≥ 2vol(KX ) + 10, by Theorem 1.10, H 1(OX (KX + αM)) = 0 and hence
H 0(OX(KX + αM + D)) → H 0(OD(KD + αM|D)) = ⊕H 0(ODi(KDi + αM|Di))
is surjective where D = P Di and each Di is a prime divisor. Since the components of D
are not φ exceptional, M · Di > 0, H 0(ODi(KDi + αM|Di)) 6= 0 for all i and so a general
element of H 0(OX (KX + αM + D)) does not vanish along any component of D.
The proof that h0(OX (KX + L)) > 0 is similar (and easier).
Now consider the following commutative diagram
−−−→

OX(KX + mL + D)

OD(KD + mL|D)

(cid:3)

OX ((2m − 1)(KX + L + D)) −−−→ OD((2m − 1)(KD + L|D))

where the vertical maps are induced by a general divisor in |(m − 1)(2KX + L + 2D)| =
|2(m − 1)(KX + αM + D)|. Since no component of D is contained in the support of this
divisor (Claim 1.15), it follows that

(1.C.5)

h0(OX ((2m − 1)(KX + L + D))) − h0(OX ((2m − 2)(KX + L + D) + KX + L)) =

Let P (m) = h0(OX(m(KX + L + D))), then P (m) = m2vol(KX + L + D) + o(m2). Since
h0(OX (KX + L)) > 0 (see Claim 1.15), we have h0(OX ((2m− 2)(KX + L + D) + KX + L)) ≥
P (2m − 2) and hence by (1.C.5), we have

h0(OD((KD + mL|D))).

(1.C.6)

P (2m − 1) − P (m − 2) ≥ Q(m) := h0(OD((KD + mL|D))) = mL · D + o(m).

Comparing leading terms of P (m) and Q(m), it follows that
4vol(KX + L + D) ≥ L · D. (cid:3)

2. THE PROOFS OF THE MAIN RESULTS

2.A. Preliminary results
Lemma 2.1. Fix C ⊂ [0, 1] a DCC set, then there exists a constant V > 0 such that if (X, B)
is a klt surface such that ρ(X) = 1, coeﬀ(B) ⊂ C and KX + B ∼Q 0, then (−KX )2 ≤ V .
Proof. Suppose that (−KX )2 > V , then for any smooth point x ∈ X there exists a Q-divisor
G ∼Q −KX such that multx(G) > V 1/2 (cf. [Laz04, 10.4.12]). Since ρ(X) = 1, we may
assume that all components of G contain a general point x ∈ X and in particular are not
contained in the support of B. Let Φ = (1 − δ)B + δG such that (X, Φ) is log canonical
but not klt. Notice that 0 < δ < 2/V 1/2 (cf. [Laz04, 9.3.2]). Perturbing G we may in fact
assume that there is a unique non-klt center Z for (X, Φ).

If Z is a divisor, then (since ρ(X) = 1) we may assume that δG = Z. Restricting to Z we

have

0 ≡ (KX + (1 − δ)B + δG)|Z = KZ + DiﬀZ((1 − δ)B).

8

Since deg DiﬀZ((1 − δ)B) ≥ 0 then deg(KZ) ∈ {0,−2}. If B 6= 0, then

2 = deg DiﬀZ((1 − δ)B)

(see Lemma 1.1) easily implies that δ is bounded from below (cf. [HMX14a, 5.2]) and hence
(−KX)2 is bounded from above. If B = 0 then KX ≡ 0 and the claim is trivial.
Therefore we may assume that dim Z = 0. Let ν : X ′ → X be the extraction of the
corresponding curve E of discrepancy −1 so that KX ′ + E + Φ′ = ν∗(KX + Φ) ∼Q 0 where
∗ Φ. Write KX ′ + B′ + aE = ν∗(KX + B) ∼Q 0 where a < 1. We run the ﬁrst
Φ′ = ν−1
step of the KX ′ + Φ′ ≡ −E minimal model program. If the induced rational map is a Mori
ﬁber space X ′ → W , then restricting to a general ﬁber F we let Φ′′ = Φ′|F , E′′ = E|F and
B′′ = B′|F , and if the induced rational map is a divisorial contraction π : X ′ → F , then we
let Φ′′, E′′ and B′′ be the pushforwards of Φ′, E and B′. We have that

KF + B′′ + aE′′ ≡ 0,
KF + B′′ + E′′ ≡ (1 − a)E′′ is ample and since Φ′′ ≥ (1 − δ)B′′, then

KF + Φ′′ + E′′ ≡ 0,

δB′′ ≡ (1 − a)E′′ + Φ′′ − (1 − δ)B′′ ≥ 0.

It follows that B′′ 6= 0 and KF + (1 − η)B′′ + E′′ ≡ 0 for some 0 < η < δ.
If dim F = 1, then since the coeﬃcients of B′′ are in the DCC set C, there exists a constant
β > 0 such that deg(ηB′′) = deg(KF + B′′ + E′′) ≥ β. But then, since KF + B′′ + aE′′ ≡ 0,
we have

2 ≥ deg(B′′) ≥ β/η > β/δ ≥ βV 1/2/2

and so V and hence (−KX )2 are bounded from above.
If dim F = 2, let (KF + B′′ + E′′)|E ′′ = KE ′′ + Diﬀ E ′′(B′′). Since (F, E′′) is purely log
terminal, then E′′ is smooth and by adjunction then the coeﬃcients of DiﬀE ′′(B′′) are in the
DCC set D(C) and so
where β = min{P b′
i ∈ D(C), P b′
i|b′

−2 + deg(Diﬀ E ′′(B′′)) = (KF + B′′ + E′′) · E′′ ≥ β − 2 > 0

as E′′ is rational,

However, by Lemma 1.2, we have

λ =

deg(DiﬀE ′′(B′′)) ≤

(KF + λB′′ + E′′)|E ′′ ≥ KE ′′ + λDiﬀE ′′(B′′) ≡ 0 ≡ (KF + (1 − η)B′′ + E′′)|E ′′

and so 1 − δ < 1 − η ≤ λ ≤ 2/β < 1. But then

Lemma 2.2. Fix C ⊂ [0, 1] a DCC set, then there exists an ε > 0 such that if (X, B) is a
projective klt surface such that ρ(X) = 1, coeﬀ(B) ⊂ C and KX + B ∼Q 0, then (X, B) is ε

Proof. Suppose that the claim is false. Then there is a sequence of pairs (Xn, Bn) as above
with total discrepancy a(Xn, Bn) = εn − 1 such that εn is a decreasing sequence with limit
0. Let C′ = C ∪ {1 − εn}n∈N then C′ is a DCC set. Suppose that (Xn, Bn) does not contain a
component of coeﬃcient 1 − εn. Let ν : X ′ → X = Xn be a projective birational morphism
extracting the corresponding divisor E so that ρ(X ′/X) = 1 and the exceptional divisor is
E. We may write KX ′ + B′ + eE = ν∗(KX + B) where e = 1 − εn. Since ρ(X ′) = 2 there
is a second extremal ray R2 (here R1 = [E]). Since (KX ′ + B′) · R2 = −eE · R2 < 0, it
follows that R2 is KX ′ + B′ negative and hence it can be contracted. Let µ : X ′ → X ′′ be
the corresponding contraction. If dim X ′′ = 1, then let F ≃ P1 be a general ﬁber. We have

0 = deg(KX ′ + B′ + eE)|F = −2 + (B′ + eE) · F = −2 +X bi + e

Since bi ∈ C, it is easy to see that e = 1 − εn is constant for n ≫ 0 which is impossible.
Therefore, we may assume that X ′ → X ′′ is a birational contraction. Then KX ′′ + B′′ + eS =
µ∗(KX ′ + B′ + eE) ∼Q 0. Replacing X by X ′′ and B by B′′ + eS, we may assume that B
contains a component S of coeﬃcient e = 1 − εn.

Write B = B′ + eS. We then have

εS2 = (1 − e)S2 = (KX + B′ + S) · S = deg(KS + Diﬀ S(B′)) ≥ β − 2

where β = min{P b′

Lemma 2.3. Fix C ⊂ [0, 1] a DCC set, then there exists a constant δ > 0 such that if
(X, B =Pr
i=1 biBi) is a klt surface such that KX + B is big, and bi ∈ C, then KX + (1− δ)B
is big.

(cid:3)

Proof. If this were not the case, then there is a sequence of klt surfaces (Xn, Bn) and a
decreasing sequence of numbers δn > 0 such that lim δn = 0 and κ(KXn + (1 − δn)Bn) ∈
{0, 1}. After running a (KXn + (1 − δn)Bn)-minimal model program, we may assume that
KXn + (1 − δn)Bn is nef. Now we run a KXn-minimal model program. After ﬁnitely many
divisorial contractions, we may assume that we have a Mori ﬁber space f : X ′
n → Zn. Since
each divisorial contraction is automatically KXn +(1−δn)Bn-trivial (see [HMX14a, 5.1, 5.2]),
we may assume that KX ′

n is nef and f is KX ′
If dim Zn = 1, let Fn ≃ P1 be a general ﬁber. We have

n · Fn 6= 0. Therefore 2/(1− δn) is a decreasing
sequence contained in the DCC set {P nibi|ni ∈ N, bi ∈ C}. Thus δn is evenytually constant
as required.
n ≡ 0 and the
n belong to a DCC set, say C′, by Lemma 2.2 there exists an ε > 0
coeﬃcients of (1 − δn)B′

Remark 2.4. An eﬀective version of (2.3) is proven in [AM04, 4.6].

Lemma 2.5. Fix ε > 0 then there exists a constant ̺ = ̺(ε) such that if (X, B) is a
projective ε-log canonical surface and −(KX + B) is nef, then rk Pic(X) ≤ ̺. In particular
the number of exceptional divisors of negative discrepancy aE(X, B) < 0 is at most ̺.
Proof. Let f : X ′ → X be a projective birational morphism such that KX ′ +B′ = f ∗(KX +B)
where B′ ≥ 0 and aE(X ′, B′) ≥ 0 for any divisor E exceptional over X ′ (in other words f
extracts precisely the divisors of negative discrepancy aE(X, B) < 0). Clearly −(KX ′ + B′)
is nef, X ′ is smooth and coeﬀ(B′) ∈ (0, 1 − ε]. By [Ale94, Theorem 6.3] (see also [AM04,
Theorem 1.8]) there exists a a constant ̺ = ̺(ε) such that ρ(X) ≤ ρ(X ′) ≤ ̺. Finally the
number of exceptional divisors of negative discrepancy is just ρ(X ′)− ρ(X) ≤ ρ(X ′)− 1 and
the lemma follows.

(cid:3)

Lemma 2.6. Fix k ∈ N and ε > 0. There exists an integer N = N(k, ε) such that if (X, B)
is an ε-klt surface singularity such that the number of exceptional divisors of discrepancy
aE(X, B) < 0 is ≤ k then NKX is Cartier and NG is Cartier for any integral Weil divisor
G contained in the support of B.
Proof. (See also [Ale94] and [AM04]) Let ν : X ′ → X be a partial resolution extracting all
divisors of discrepancy aE(X, B) < 0, in particular X ′ has at most du Val singularities which
are not contained in the support of B′ where KX ′ +B′ = ν∗(KX +B). By the classiﬁcation of
klt singularities [Ale81], the weights of each curve in the corresponding graph are bounded
by 2/ε (cf. [Ale94, Proof of 7.5]) and so there are only ﬁnitely many possibilities for the
corresponding graph. Let G = KX or G be a component of the support of B and G′ its

strict transform. Then we may write ν∗G = G′ +P eiEi where the Ei are exceptional
divisors and the denominators of the ei divide t = |det(Ek · Ek′)|. But then t(G′ +P eiEi)

is integral. Since X ′ has only du Val singularities, tν∗G is Cartier. By the Basepoint-free
theorem tG is Cartier (cf. the proof of [AM04, 4.7]).
(cid:3)

2.B. Proof of Theorem 2
We follow some ideas from [AM04] and [Ale94] applying techniques from [BHMM12]. We may
assume that C ⊃ {1− 1
m|m ∈ N}. Note that it suﬃces to prove the theorem for log canonical
pairs. To see this, consider an slc model (X, B) and its normalization ν : ∪Xi → X. Writing
KXi + Bi = (ν|Xi)∗(KX + B), we have log canonical models (Xi, Bi) such that coeﬀ(Bi) ∈ C
and (KX + B)2 =P(KXi + Bi)2. The claim now follows easily since if D is a DCC set, then
so is D′ = {P di|di ∈ D}.
Suppose now, by way of contradiction, that (Xm, Bm) is a sequence of slc surfaces deﬁned
over the algebraically closed ﬁeld Lm of characteristic pm > 0, such that coeﬀ(Bm) ⊆ C and
(2.B.1)
In particular we may ﬁx a constant V > 0 such that vol(KXm + Bm) ≤ V for all m ∈ N.

vol(KXm + Bm) > vol(KXm+1 + Bm+1).

Passing to a log resolution, we may assume that (Xm, Bm) is an snc pair. In fact, given a
m be the strict transform of Bm plus the exceptional

r for some r ≫ 0, we may assume

birational morphism X ′

Then we replace (Xm, Bm) by (X ′
condition, replacing the coeﬃcients that equal 1 by 1 − 1
that (Xm, Bm) is klt.

m) = vol(KXm + Bm) (cf. Proposition 1.4) and coeﬀ(B′

m → Xm let B′
m + B′
m, B′

Claim 2.7. [Ale94, 7.6] We may assume that the pairs (Xm, Bm) are log birationally bounded,
i.e., there exists a constant d > 0 and birational maps fm : Xm 99K Zm and very ample
divisors Hm on Zm such that H 2
m ≤ d and Hm · BZm ≤ d where BZm is the sum of the strict
transform of Bm and the Zm 99K Xm exceptional divisors.

m is klt and big. Let f ′

m : X ′

By Lemma 2.3 it follows easily that there is a ﬁnite set of rational numbers C′ depending
only on C and divisors 0 ≤ Dm ≤ Bm such that KXm + Dm is big and coeﬀ(Dm) ⊆ C′. By
[Ale94, 7.3] we may also assume that the number of components of Bm is bounded by a
constant (depending only on C). Let µm : Xm → X ′
m be a minimal model for KXm + Dm and
m + D′
m = (µm)∗Dm ≤ B′
D′
m → Zm
m = (µm)∗Bm. Note that KX ′
be the be the corresponding log canonical model for KXm + Dm and fm : Xm → Zm the
induced morphism. Since the number of components of Dm is bounded, it follows easily
that the number of divisors E over Zm of discrepancy aE(Zm, (fm)∗Dm) < 0 is bounded
from above. By Lemma 2.6, there exists an integer N > 0 depending only on C and V such
that Gm = N(KZm + (fm)∗Dm) is ample and Cartier. By Corollary 1.12, |KZm + qGm| is
birational for all q ≥ 18 and hence so is |KXm + 18N(KXm + Dm)| . Since Bm ≥ Dm, it
follows that |KXm + 18N(KXm + Bm)| is birational. Since vol(18N(KX + B)) ≤ (18N)2V , by
Theorem 1.13 (with q = 18N) it follows that the pairs (Xm, Bm) are log birationally degree
bounded.
Claim 2.8. We may assume that fm : Xm → Zm is a morphism given by a ﬁnite sequence
of blow ups along smooth strata of (Zm, bBZm) where bBZm = (BZm)red and that (Zm, bBZm) has
simple normal crossings and is degree bounded.
Proof. Let ([Zm], [bBZm]) be the internal pair associated to the sequence of pairs (Zm, bBZm)
where bBZm = (BZm)red. Since Zm and bBZm are degree bounded, it follows by Proposition 1.7
that there exists a pair (Z, bB) deﬁned over k = [Lm] such that (Z, bB)int = ([Zm], [bBZm]). Let
m], [bB′
ν : Z ′ → Z be a log resolution of (Z, bB) and bB′ = ν−1
]),
are degree bounded (for almost all m ∈ N). Replacing
m → Z ′
. Replacing (Xm, Bm) by (X ′
m) and Xm → Zm by
m we may assume that fm is a morphism, (Zm, BZm) has simple normal crossings

then it is easy to see that Z ′
(Xm, Bm) by an appropriate birational model (X ′
is a morphism with (f ′
m → Z ′
X ′
and is degree bounded.
Let (Z, bB) be the projective pair (over k) deﬁned above so that (Z, bB)int = ([Zm], [bBZm])
where as above bB and bBZm denote the reduced divisors. Let X ′′
m → Zm be a ﬁnite sequence of
strata such that every divisor E on Xm of discrepancy aE(Zm, BZm) < 0 is a divisor on X ′′
m.
Let B′′
m → Zm exceptional divisors which
are not also X ′′
99K Xm exceptional, taken with coeﬃcient 1−1/r for some r ≫ 0. Then one

can see easily that vol(KXm + Bm) = vol(KX ′′

m), we may therefore assume that each (Xm, Bm) is obtained
(cid:3)

m, B′′

For almost all m ∈ N, the strata of (Zm, bBZm) are in one-to-one correspondence with the
strata of (Z, bB) (cf. [BHMM12, 3.8]). Therefore, we deﬁne (X m, Bm) by blowing up the
corresponding strata on (Z, bB) and choosing the coeﬃcients of Bm to match those of Bm.
Let ν be any divisorial valuation over Z. Since the coeﬃcients belong to a DCC set, after
passing to a subsequence, we may assume that the sequence MBm(ν) is non decreasing and
hence that lim MBm(ν) exists. Notice that if MBm(ν) 6= 0, then ν corresponds to either
a component of bB or to a divisor exceptional over Z. If moreover MBm(ν) 6∈ {0, 1} then
the corresponding divisor is obtained by blowing up Z along some strata of bB. Therefore,
there are only countably many divisorial valuations ν for which MBm(ν) 6= MBk (ν). By
a standard diagonalization argument, we may assume that after passing to a subsequence,
there is a well deﬁned b-divisor over Z deﬁned by B(ν) = lim MBm(ν) for any valuation ν
over Z. Let Φ := BZ. Let Bm
Z Since C
satisﬁes the DCC, it follows that

Z be the pushforward of Bm to Z, then BZ = lim Bm

(2.B.2)

Z ≤ Φ

for almost all m ∈ N.

Claim 2.9. We may assume that

(2.B.3)

where Φ = BZ.

LΦ ≤ B,

Proof. We follow the proof of [HMX13, 5.7] checking that our choices do not aﬀect the volume
of KXm + Bm. Let (Z ′, B′) be the reduction of (Z, B) deﬁned in [HMX13, 5.7], so that if
Φ′ = B′

Z ′, then we have the inequality of b-divisors
LΦ′ ≤ B′.

Recall that the reduction (Z ′, B′) is given by a ﬁnite sequence of cuts where a cut is deﬁned
as follows: given a birational morphism of smooth projective varieties µ : Z ′ → Z and a
subset Σ of the µ exceptional divisors, for every valuation σ ∈ Σ, let Γσ = (LΦ ∧ B)Yσ, where
Yσ → Z is the divisorial contraction of the divisor over Z corresponding to σ which deﬁned
in [HMX13, 5.4] and Φ = BZ. Let Θ = ∧σ∈Σ(LΓσ )Z ′, the minimum of the divisors (Γσ)Z ′.
The cut of (Z, B), associated to Z ′ → Z and Σ, is the pair (Z ′, B′), where B′ = B ∧ MΘ, so
that B′
Z ′ = Θ ∧ BZ ′ and B′(ν) = B(ν) for any valuation ν corresponding to an exceptional
divisor over Z ′. We may assume that Z ′ → Z is given by a ﬁnite sequence of blow ups along
strata of bB and so we let Z ′
m → Zm be obtained by the corresponding sequence of blow ups
along strata of BZm for almost all m ∈ N. After possibly blowing up X m and replacing Bm
by its strict transform plus the exceptional divisor, we may assume that X m → Z factors via
a morphism X m → Z ′ and similarly we have morphisms Xm → Z ′
Now consider the divisors B′m on X m deﬁned by B′m = Bm ∧ (MΘm)Xm where Θm =
Yσ are the pushforwards of Bm to Z
∧σ∈Σ(LΓm
and Yσ. Then, as in the proof of [HMX13, 5.7], we may assume that B′ = lim MB ′m. Let
m be the divisors on Xm corresponding to B′m. We will show that vol(KXm + Bm) =
B′
vol(KXm + B′

m). Assuming this, we may replace Bm by B′

It then follows that

Thus, by (2.B.4) and Proposition 1.4

Bm ∧ (LΘm)Xm ≤ B′

m = Bm ∧ (MΘm)Xm ≤ Bm.

vol(KXm + Bm) = vol(KXm + B′

m).

Replacing Bm by B′

m the claim follows.

(cid:3)

Claim 2.10. For almost all m ∈ N we have vol(KZm + tΦZm) = vol(KZ + tΦ) for all
t ∈ [0, 1] ∩ Q.
Proof. There are ﬁnitely many birational morphisms {ψi : Z → W i}i∈I such that for any
t ∈ [0, 1], there exists an i ∈ I such that ψi is a minimal model for KZ +tΦ. Let [ψi
m] : [Zm] →
[W i
m] be the corresponding morphism of internal schemes. It is easy to see that for almost all
m,∗ΦZm)2 = (KW i + tψ∗ΦZ)2
m ∈ N this is a minimal model for KZm + tΦZm and (KW i
(cf. Lemma 1.9). Therefore, the claim follows.
(cid:3)

m + tψi

Now we observe that

vol(KXm + Bm) ≤ vol(KZm + BZm) ≤ vol(KZm + ΦZm),

where the ﬁrst inequality follows as BZm is the pushforward of Bm, and the second as
BZm ≤ ΦZm cf. (2.B.2).
On the other hand, for any ε > 0, the pair (Z, (1− ε)Φ) is klt with simple normal crossings
and hence there is a terminalization h : Y → Z (given by a ﬁnite sequence of blow ups along
strata of (Z, (1 − ε)Φ)) so that (Y, Ψ := L(1−ε)Φ) is terminal. We have that for some λ > 0,
(2.B.5)
where the last inequality follows from (2.B.3). For almost all m ∈ N we may consider hm :
Ym → Zm given by the same sequence of blow ups along strata of (Zm, ΦZm). Then, denoting
by BYm and Ψm the divisors on Ym corresponding to BY and Ψ, since BY = lim MBm,Y ,
comparing coeﬃcients of divisors on Y , by (2.B.5), for inﬁnitely many m ∈ N we have
Ψ ≤ MBm,Y and hence also Ψm ≤ MBm,Ym. It follows that then

Ψ ≤ (1 − λ)LΦ,Y ≤ LΦ,Y ≤ BY

(2.B.6)

vol(KZ + (1 − ε)Φ) = vol(KZm + (1 − ε)ΦZm) = vol(KYm + Ψm) ≤

≤ vol(KYm + MBm,Ym) = vol(KXm + Bm),

where the ﬁrst (in)equality follows from Claim 2.10, the second since (Ym, Ψm) is a terminal-
ization of (Zm, (1 − ε)ΦZm) (observe that Ψm = (L(1−ε)ΦZm )Zm and apply Proposition 1.4),
the third since Ψm ≤ MBm,Ym, and the fourth by Proposition 1.4. Taking the limit as ε → 0,
by (2.B.1) we obtain

vol(KZ + Φ) ≤ lim vol(KXm + Bm) < vol(KXm + Bm).

14

Combining this with the above equations and Claim 2.10, we have that

(2.B.7)

vol(KZ + Φ) < vol(KXm + Bm) ≤ vol(KZm + ΦZm) = vol(KZ + Φ)

for inﬁnitely many m. This is the required contradiction and it completes the proof of
Theorem 2.
(cid:3)

2.C. Proof of Theorem 1
It suﬃces to show that for any sequence of projective log canonical surfaces (Xm, Bm) with
ﬁxed volume (KXm + Bm)2 = v and coeﬀ(Bm) ∈ C, there exists an integer r > 0 such
that r(K ¯Xm + ¯Bm) is very ample where φm : Xm → ¯Xm is the log canonical model of
(Xm, Bm) and ¯Bm = φm,∗Bm. Arguing by contradiction (and passing to a subsequence),
assume that m!(K ¯Xm + ¯Bm) is not very ample for all m > 0. Following the notation in the
above proof, let Z → W be the log canonical model of (Z, Φ = BZ). Let [Zm] → [Wm]
be the corresponding morphism of internal schemes, so that for almost all m ∈ N we have
morphisms hm : Zm → Wm which are log canonical models for (Zm, ΦZm). We have
vol(KXm + Bm) = vol(KZm + ΦZm) ≥ vol(KZm + BZm) ≥ vol(KXm + Bm),

where the ﬁrst (in)equality follows since all inequalities in (2.B.7) are actually equalities, the
second since ΦZm ≥ BZm and the last as KZm + BZm is the pushforward of KXm + Bm.
Since KZm + BZm is big and has a log canonical model, and ΦZm ≥ BZm, it follows by
In particular,
[HMX14b, 2.2.2] that Zm → Wm is a log canonical model for (Zm, BZm).
(hm)∗BZm = (hm)∗ΦZm is rational and hence so is h∗Φ. But then by the result over the ﬁxed
ﬁeld k, we know that there is an integer r depending only on υ = vol(KXm + Bm) and C
such that r(KW + h∗Φ) is Cartier and very ample. But then r(KWm + hm,∗Φ) is Cartier and
very ample for inﬁnitely many m > 0. This is the required contradiction and the assertion
of Theorem 1 follows.

2.D. Proof of Corollary 3
We may assume that 1 − ε ∈ C. It suﬃces to show that any sequence of ε log canonical
projective pairs (Xm, Bm) with dim Xm = 2, coeﬀ(Bm) ∈ C, KXm + Bm nef and big and
vol(KXm + Bm) ≤ v is degree bounded.
Following the proof of Theorem 2, we may assume that (Z, BZ) is a simple normal crossings
pair with coeﬃcients ≤ 1−ε. Replacing Z by an appropriate birational model, we may in fact
assume that (Z, BZ) is terminal and hence so are (Zm, BZm). But then vol(KXm + Bm) =
vol(KZm + BZm) for almost all m ∈ N by Proposition 1.4 and so we may assume that
(Xm, Bm) = (Zm, BZm). Notice that we have replaced Xm by an appropriate birational
model and Bm by its strict transform plus the exceptional divisors with coeﬃcient (1 − ε),
hence KXm + Bm may no longer be nef. Let Bm be the divisors on Z corresponding to Bm
on Xm. Since the support of Bm has ﬁnitely many components and C is a DCC set, after
passing to a subsequence, we may assume that Bm ≤ Bm+1 ≤ Bm+2 ≤ . . . lim Bi = B∞. Let
m be the corresponding divisors on Xm, so that B∞
B∞
m ≥ Bm. We claim that KZ + B∞ is
big. If this were not the case, then Z would be covered by curves C with (KZ + B∞)· C ≤ 0.
But then, the same would be true for (Xm, Bm) as for almost all m ∈ N we have

0 ≥ (KZ + B∞) · C = (KXm + B∞

15

m ) · Cm ≥ (KXm + Bm) · Cm,

where (C)int = [Cm]. This contradicts the fact that KXm + Bm is big. Since being big is
an open condition, it follows that KZ + (1 − δ)B∞ is big for all 0 < δ ≪ 1 and we may
assume that (1 − δ)B∞ ≤ Bm ≤ B∞. The set of all minimal/canonical models Z → W for
pairs (Z, G) with (1 − δ)B∞ ≤ G ≤ B∞ is bounded. Arguing as in the proof of Claim 2.10
the corresponding rational maps Zm → Wm give minimal/canonical models for (Xm, Bm) for
almost all m ∈ N. Corollary 3 follows easily.
2.E. Proof of Theorem 4
Suppose that (Xm, Bm) is a sequence of pairs and Xm → Sm is a sequence of morphisms
from a projective 3-fold to a smooth curve deﬁned over Lm an algebraically closed ﬁeld of
characteristic pm > 0 such that lim pm = ∞ and the conclusion fails for each m. We let
(Xm,η, Bm,η) be the generic ﬁber deﬁned over the ﬁeld of rational functions ̥m = k(Sm). Let
(X m,η, Bm,η) be the pairs deﬁned over the algebraic closure ̥m obtained by the base change
̥m ⊂ ̥m. Since Bm,η ∈ C and vol(KX m,η + Bm,η) = vol(KXm,η + Bm,η) = υ, by Theorem 1,
there is a ﬁxed integer r > 0 (independent of m) such that r(KXm,η +Bm,η) is very ample. As
Xm and the components of Bm have bounded degree, by Proposition 1.7 there exists a pair

(X, bB) deﬁned over ̥ = [̥m] such that (X, bB)int = ([X m,η], [(Bm,η)red]). Since coeﬀ(Bm) ⊆
r(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) 0 ≤ a ≤ ro , after passing to a subsequence, we may assume that there is a divisor B on
n a
X such that Bint = [Bm,η]. Let k = [Lm] and S′ be a curve deﬁned over k such that k(S′) ⊃ ̥
is a ﬁnite extension and let (XS ′, BS ′) → Spec k(S′) be induced from (X, B) → Spec ̥ by
the base change Spec k(S′) → Spec ̥. Let (X ′, B′) → S′ be a compactiﬁcation. Since
char k = 0, after base changing, resolving and taking the relative canonical model, one may
assume that (X ′, B′) → S′ is a semistable family of log canonical models. Next consider the
corresponding internal objects X ′
m], and the corresponding
internal morphisms. Observe that (X ′
m is a semistable family for almost all
m ∈ N. This gives the required contradiction and proves Theorem 4.
