Abstract

We’ve performed precise measurements of electron scattering on molec-
ular hydrogen and deuterium by using the ”Troitsk nu-mass” setup. Elec-
trons were generated by the electron gun with an energy line width better
than 0.3 eV. The electron energies were 14, 17, 18.7, 19 and 25 keV.
The windowless gaseous tritium source (WGTS) was ﬁlled by hydrogen
isotopes and served as a target. The total column density was adjusted
to form a length of 0.35–0.7 of the electron mean free path. The inte-
gral spectrum of scattered electrons was measured by the electrostatic
spectrometer with a magnetic adiabatic collimation and relative energy
resolution 8.3·10−5. As a result, the shapes of molecular excitation and
ionization spectra were extracted for both isotopes. We did not ﬁnd any
diﬀerence between hydrogen and deuterium targets. The relative energy
dependence was extracted too.

Introduction

Experimental measurements of electron cross-section at keV energy with atomic
and molecular hydrogen are relevant for astrophysics and physics of low-temperature
plasma [1].
Intergalactic space electrons with low energy play an important
role in the investigation of interstellar clouds evolution [2]. Relation between
molecular excitation and ionization cross-sections is also crucial in calculation of
electron trapping in the system with magnetic mirrors. Such a trap is formed by
magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration in the windowless gaseous tritium source (WGTS)
used by experiment ”Troitsk nu-mass” in search for a sterile neutrino sign in the

1

tritium β-decay spectrum [3]. This experiment is aimed to measure β-spectrum
in a wide energy range. Thus, understanding of the trapping eﬀect at diﬀerent
electron energies becomes critical too. The previous measurements of electron
scattering on molecular tritium in the Troitsk experiment were carried out at
a ﬁxed electron energy of 18.6 keV [4] (in that article one could also ﬁnd the
energy loss measurement in quench condensed D2 ﬁlms). The energy resolution
in that measurement was about 3.5 eV. In the current setup we have a new
spectrometer with an energy resolution of 1.5 eV for 19 keV electrons [3]. This
allows us to measure the molecular excitation peak with better precision.

Accurate descriptions of inelastic cross-section for electron collisions with
light molecules and atoms were published long ago [5, 6]. For energies of elec-
trons much higher than the molecular ionization potential the Born approxima-
tion is applied to H2 with a wave function with two interaction centers. This
method allows one to evaluate cross-sections for all possible processes: genera-
tion of negative and positive molecular ions, excitation of molecular states [7],
dissociation or their combination [8].

The most practical formula for hydrogen matching the experimental cross-

section was presented by Lotz [9]:

σion ∼

log(cid:0) E
I (cid:1)E · I (cid:20)1 − b exp(cid:18)−c(cid:18) E

I

− 1(cid:19)(cid:19)(cid:21)

(1)

where σion - ionization cross-section, E -energy of electron, I - ionization po-
tential, b, c - numerical constants. The expression in square brackets describes
behavior at the electron energy of a few hundred electron-volts. At the energy
much higher than the ionization potential I formula 1 simpliﬁes to

σion ∼ log(cid:18) E

I (cid:19) /(E · I).

(2)

In paper [10] the absolute ionization cross-sections for diﬀerent gases were mea-
sured at energies under 20 keV. Our interest is not only in ionization cross
section and its energy dependence but in total inelastic cross-section including
molecular excitation and relation between excitation and ionization probabili-
ties.

In this paper we describe measurements of electron scattering on gaseous
hydrogen and deuterium using the electron gun and the new spectrometer. The
shapes of excitation and ionization spectra were extracted for electron energy
of 14, 17, 18.7, 19 and 25 keV. The paper is organized as a follows: ﬁrst,
the Troitsk experiment set up is brieﬂy described, then follows the explanation
of measurement procedure and data analysis. The last chapters presents our
results and summary.

2 Experimental set-up and procedure

The experimental set-up was very identical to that used in the previous mea-
surement [4] but with a new spectrometer which has about a factor of two better
energy resolution [3]. In brief, a Windowless Gaseous Tritium Source (WGTS)
ﬁlled with hydrogen isotopes served as a target. the WGTS with an axial mag-
netic ﬁeld was ﬁlled with gas, circulating in a closed loop. The main part of the

2

gas being exposed to the electron beam was contained in a 3 meter long pipe.
The pipe was kept at a constant temperature of about 30 K which is above the
boiling point for hydrogen and deuterium but lower than freezing temperature
for nitrogen and oxygen (thus eﬀectively removing these gases from interaction
volume). The pipe was continuously cooled down by the gaseous helium ﬂow
returning from cryostat to the refrigeration system, and heated by the heaters
wrapped around the pipe. The pipe temperature was controlled by a set of
sensors alongside the interaction volume and stayed better than ±0.3K during
one data taking run. This deﬁnes the relative gas density stability at the level
of 0.3/30 = 0.01. The average column density of hydrogen isotope was chosen
to be about 0.35–0.7 of the electron mean free path depending on electron en-
ergy and a particular ﬁll which corresponds to about 5 · 1016 molecules per cm2
. Electrons were generated by the electron gun located at the rear side of the
WGTS. The gun has a half transparent gold-plated quartz cathode connected to
the negative potential power supply and is illuminated by ultraviolet deuterium
lamp. Details of the gun design can be found in [3]. The electron energy spread
is deﬁned by stability of the high voltage power supply (HV), it was found to
be less than ±0.3 eV. Measurements were taken in two separate periods: at
electron energy 14, 18.7 and 25 keV in the ﬁrst run and at 14, 17, 19 keV in the
next one.

WGTS has a diﬀerentiating pumping system which prevents gas penetration
into the spectrometer. Electrons from the gun pass WGTS, scatter there with
some probability on target gas then enter the spectrometer with high vacuum
and a strong magnetic ﬁeld, B0 = 7.2 Tesla, in the pinch magnet and then
are adiabatically guided into a low ﬁeld Bm = 6 · 10−6 Tesla in the center of
the spectrometer. The size of the spectrometer is about 10 meter in length
and 2.8 meter in diameter. At the same time electrons are de-accelerated by
a strong electrostatic ﬁeld formed by a single cylinder-shaped electrode sitting
at the analyzing potential [3]. The spectrometer serves as an electrostatic ﬁlter
with a magnetic adiabatic collimation (MAC-E ﬁlter). By its principle this
is an integral spectrometer. The ﬁlter transmission function has a step-like
shape versus the applied potential and deﬁnes the slope versus the electron
energy as ∆E = E · Bm/B0, Fig. 1. At the other side of the spectrometer
there is another superconducting solenoid magnet with a ﬁeld strength of 2.1
Tesla, which collects all electrons onto the detector at the ground potential.
The electrons reaching the detector are accelerated to the original energy after
passing the electrode.

The Si (Li)-detector with a 10 nm gold window detects electrons with the
energy above 2 keV. After selecting a proper window for detector signal ampli-
tude, see Fig. 2, the relative counting rate at a particular spectrometer potential
was the main source of information for the scattering events.

The measuring procedure was the following: after getting all superconduct-
ing magnets at their nominal currents and conﬁrming that the WGTS pipe
temperature was stabilized, some portion of gas was injected into the closed
gas loop. The relative amount of gas was controlled by a pressure sensor (Px)
located in the warm (room temperature) part of the gas loop. Px is positioned
between the pump, which collects gas from both sides of the pipe, and the long
nozzle which cools gas to the pipe temperature and then injects gas in the mid-
dle of the pipe. A typical value of pressure measured by Px in this part of
the gas ﬂow loop was around 2.8–3.2 mm of Hg. We have to emphasize that

3

versus potential on the electrostatic electrode.

because of the nozzle at the entrance to the pipe, gas concentration inside the
pipe was much smaller than the value of Px. At the same time, it was found
that gas concentration in the pipe and Px are related very linearly. Beside Px
gas pressure was controlled by vacuum meters on both sides of the WGTS. At
the rear side a mass analyzer was connected to the pipe, which controlled gas
composition.

The electron energy from the gun was set by a high voltage (HV) power
supply between -14 kV and -25 kV. The output from this HV supply was also
connected to another ∆HV module, whose output gives an additional ∆HV
potential. This ∆HV can vary in the range -20 V to +900 V with a step of
0.1 V on top of the value of the main HVpower supply. The output of the
∆HV module is connected to the spectrometer. Such a conﬁguration prevents
possible high voltage ﬂuctuations in case of using two absolutely independent
HV modules. The absolute values of both power supplies were controlled by
two independent resistor dividers. The HV and dividers in sum gave stability
better than 0.15V over 200 seconds periods.

The goal of the measuring procedure is to scan electrostatic potential of
the spectrometer in the range slightly above the electron energy from the gun
to the value down to 300 V to catch the spectrum of the scattered electrons.
A typical integral spectrum measured at 18700 eV is shown in Fig. 3. There
is a sharp edge on the right similar to the step shown in Fig. 1, the slope of
which is determined by the energy resolution. Then, to the left from the step
there is a ﬂat area of about 12 V width which corresponds to the energy gap

surements at 18700 eV in hydrogen at diﬀerent HV spectrometer potentials.

between the non-scattered electrons and the electrons which lost energy after
molecular hydrogen excitation and ionization. The hight of this step relative to
the rate at the spectrometer HV lower than the electron energy by 200–300 V
(left points in Fig.3) roughly deﬁnes the probability for electron to pass WGTS
without scatterings. Then the integral spectrum goes up reﬂecting the number
of electrons which lost some energy, see below. The electron intensity was chosen
to lie between 3–6 kHz due to dead time of DAQ.

The whole spectrum was measured over 65–74 set points. To avoid the in-
ﬂuence of a possible intensity drift of the deuterium lamp (and consequently,
the electron ﬂux) control measurements were made at a monitor point of 300 V
down from the gun potential. Monitor points were collected after every two set
points. The counting rates between two monitor points were corrected for in-
tensity drift if this monitor distortion exceeded two statistical errors. Typically,
intensity was stable within 0.5% between two monitor points. Overall, it takes
about half an hour to write one data ﬁle. For one gas ﬁll in WGTS, for each
electron energy set, we try to keep even number of ﬁles by going in forward
and reverse high voltage directions. In the second round of measurements when
the electron energy was 14, 17 and 19 keV we also measured two energy points
for each gas ﬁll: 14 keV and 19 keV or 17 keV and 19 keV. This allowed us to
minimize the inﬂuence of diﬀerent column density from ﬁll to ﬁll and to get a
more precise cross section energy dependence.

3 Data processing and analysis

3.1 Preliminary data processing

The preliminary data analysis for this experiment was done in the following
sequence:

1. Initial readout of binary data ﬁles. The ﬁles contain a set of measurements
(points) for diﬀerent spectrometer potentials. Each point contains a time
stamp and amplitude for each event in the set.

2. Events were selected in a speciﬁc Si (Li)-detector amplitude window for
further processing. We used a ﬁxed wide window that only cuts oﬀ elec-
tronics noise and didn’t aﬀect the signal. All events in the window were
counted to get the resulting counting rate at each spectrometer set. This
counting rate was also corrected for eﬀective data acquisition dead time
of 8 µs which also accounted the event pile-up eﬀects.

3. Then, points at the same spectrometer potential values are averaged over

diﬀerent ﬁles for each electron energy set.

The integral spectrum after this procedure is shown in Fig. 3

3.2 Extraction of energy loss spectrum shape

The experimental spectrum for energy loss measurements can be represented by
the following expression:

S(U ) = Z Egun

U

R(U, E) · T r(ε)dE,

(3)

6

where R(U, E) is a spectrometer resolution function, see Fig. 1 (it is also de-
scribed in [11]), ε = Egun − E is an electron energy loss and T r(ε) is a gas
target transmission function. This expression also accounts for the electron gun
line width by using the resolution function, which was measured with the same
electron gun.

The transmission function T r(ε) itself consists of no-loss δ(ε) transmission
and a sum of single, double, triple and other scattering spectra with appropri-
ate weights pi = X ie−X
. Here X is a dimensionless parameter, called target
thickness, which equals the electron inelastic interaction probability during its
ﬂight through the target:

k!

It allows one to deﬁne :

X =

ltarget

λ

= ltargetnσtot.

T r(ε) = p0δ(ε) +Xi

piLi(ε),

(4)

(5)

with maximum i automatically chosen so that the probability of the highest
order scattering is less than 10−4. The scattering functions Li(ε) are obtained
by the subsequent convolution of a single scattering loss spectrum L(ε) = L1(ε)
with itself, Fig. 4

Figure 4: Contribution of double scattering in the measured energy loss spec-
trum. The triple scattering will be barely seen in this plot.

The aim of this experiment is to determine the shape of L(ε). It is rather
diﬃcult to extract the shape of transmission function T r(ε) directly from equa-
tion 3, but one can deﬁne this function and then ﬁt it to the experimental data.
We used parameterization similar to the one in the previous experiment [4]:

L(ε) = N orm


W 2

1

W 2

2

W 2

2 +4(ε−P2)2

7

(cid:17) ε ≤ εc

ε > εc

(6)

where A is a constant, Pi and Wi deﬁne position and width of the relevant terms,
εc is selected dynamically to ensure that the function is continuous and N orm
coeﬃcient is calculated automatically to keep the loss probability integral equal
to 1. The ﬁrst part of this piecewise equation corresponds to the energy losses
due to molecular excitations, the second one describes the continuous ionization
spectrum. The distinction of this parametrization from the similar one in [4]
is an automatic normalization and the fact that the position of the excitation
peak, P1, was set here as a free parameter. In [4] it was ﬁxed at 12.6 eV.

It should be noted, that since this description is not based on any physical
model, the diﬀerence between the excitation and ionization parts is rather vague.
Moreover, coeﬃcient A does not have any physical meaning due to the dynamic
nature of εc and the diﬀerence in normalization factors of both parts of the
piecewise equation.

3.3 Data ﬁtting and additional calculations

Data ﬁtting procedure was performed by combination of diﬀerent ﬁtting algo-
rithms including JMINUIT and Quasi-optimal weights ﬁtter [11]. Such a com-
plicated procedure is required because of a strong correlation between energy
loss function parameters. The spectrometer resolution function R(U, E) in Eq. 3
was taken from the electron gun measurements with an empty WGTS. In addi-
tion to the parameters used in Eq. 6 the ﬁtting procedure ﬁts the background
level, total intensity and the value of X.

In order to estimate the ionization part in the total loss spectrum, the follow-
ing procedure was used: we took analytic loss function with best-ﬁt parameters
and calculated the following integral:

IonizationT ail = Z ∞

εlow

L(ε)dε

(7)

Such a value does not show the true ratio between excitation and ionization
cross-sections, but εlow is selected to be larger than any excitation level. That’s
why this value is proportional to the relative ionization probability. We used
εlow = 17 eV since it guarantees to be above excitation levels.

The direct estimation of errors for Eq. 7 is rather complicated, therefore the

following procedure was used:

1. For each ﬁtted experimental data set there is a vector of the loss function
parameters (A, P1, P2, W1 and W2) and a corresponding covariance matrix
which can be used to construct multivariate normal distribution.

2. For each such distribution a sample of a few thousand parameter sets is

generated.

3. For each parameter set from this sample a loss function is constructed and

integral Eq. 7 is calculated.

4. The distribution of such integral values of Eq. 7 is considered to be the true
distribution of this ratio. It is is proved to be non-normal, but still one can
calculate its dispersion and standard deviation for qualitative analysis.

4 Results

4.1 Energy loss function

The best ﬁts for the energy loss spectra for hydrogen and deuterium at diﬀerent
electron energies are shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, respectively. Experimental
data were ﬁtted by Eq. 6 with 5 parameters which are position and width for
excitation and ionization peaks and ratio between excitation and ionization (the
background, intensity and source thickness were also ﬁtted but were not rele-
vant for the shape analysis). Fig. 7 shows typical error bands for this ﬁtting,
which are calculated by the procedure described in Section 3.3. One may con-
clude that within our error bars all energy loss functions are the same. For the
future practical usage we averaged over all of them. The ﬁnal ﬁt parameters are
presented in Table 1.

The values presented in the table have rather small error bands and it may
seem that distinction between parameters for, say, hydrogen and deuterium
is rather large in terms of these errors, but one should remember that all the
parameters in this parametrization are strongly correlated and, therefore, should
not be compared independently. The only visual way to compare such strongly
correlated parameter sets is to compare ﬁgures like Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 with the
error band presented in Fig. 7.

For the record, this is worth mentioning that ionization potentials for hy-
drogen atoms and molecules are diﬀerent. With an accuracy better than 10−4
the ionization potential for atoms of all hydrogen isotopes is 13.60 eV [12]. For
molecules these values are 15.426 eV, 15.467 eV, 15.487 eV for H2, D2 and T2,
respectively, and can be found in many reference books. Such a precision is
beyond the sensitivity of our experiment but it is possible to qualitatively check
the similarity between H2 and D2 in our energy range.

4.2 Relative electron energy dependence

The usage of the WGTS as a gas target, in contrast to the solid substrate,
makes it rather diﬃcult to compare cross sections at diﬀerent energies. Because
of the slow but continuous hydrogen absorption on the walls of all WGTS com-
ponents, gas concentration in the pipe goes down with time. Thus, we have
to reﬁll WGTS every 5-6 hours and each gas reﬁll has its own particular gas
concentration or column density. The typical measurement at one electron en-
ergy takes at least an hour, for better statistics – a few hours. Therefore, some
methods should be found to compare electron scattering at diﬀerent energies
with a good precision. We use two methods for such measurements. The ﬁrst
one is to take data at two electron energy during the same gas ﬁll and to make
some correction for the change in column density with time. Fig. 8 illustrates
a slow drop of the extracted gas target thickness X during one deuterium ﬁll.
The points for a few runs at 14 keV measurements really show the decrease of
X extracted during the ﬁt procedure to experimental data. At the beginning of
this particular ﬁll we took two runs at 19 keV as the reference data. The 14 keV

10

randomization of all ﬁtting parameters.

points were ﬁtted by exponential function and were extrapolated to the time of
19 keV measurements – two round symbols with extrapolation error bars on the
ﬁtted line. This line represents the relative column density during this ﬁll. One
can see that the experimental points at 19 keV are below the extrapolation line
giving exactly the diﬀerence between the total cross sections at two energies.
This relation explicitly comes from Eq. 4: X = ltargetnσtot. Such an extrapola-
tion procedure was done for other energy combination 14 keV and 19 keV. We
did not take the same ﬁll measurements for 18.7 and 25 keV electrons.

The second method is aimed to use an empirical fact that gas concentration
in the pipe is proportional to the value of our pressure sensor Px located in the
room temperature part of the gas loop, see Section 2. There is a limit on such
a measurement determined by precision of Px. The sensor readout has only
two digits, thus at typical values of 2.8–3.2 mm of Hg the precision is about
0.1/3 ≈ 0.03. In Fig. 9 we demonstrate stability of X/Px ratio for two energies.
The steps were caused by a change of X and Px value by 0.1 from run to run .
Diﬀerence of X/Px for two energies reﬂects the energy dependence of the cross
section. At the same column density the cross section at a smaller energy is
larger giving a larger extracted value of X at the same proportion.

The two methods, extrapolation and X/Px agree withing the errors where
this comparison was possible. The resulting relative energy dependence is shown
in Fig. 10. All points were normalized to the value at 14 keV. The solid line
represents the ﬁt by function according to Eq. 2. We also averaged values for
hydrogen and deuterium which agree within the errors.

bars show experimental and extrapolation errors.

5 Summary

The electron scattering on molecular hydrogen and deuterium has been mea-
sured at electron energies 14, 17, 18.7, 19 and 25 keV. Electrons were generated
by the electron gun with an energy line width better than 0.3 eV. A windowless
gaseous tritium source (WGTS) of the ”Troitsk nu-mass” setup was used as a
target. The integral spectrum of scattered electrons was measured by a MAC-E
type spectrometer with a relative energy resolution of 8.3·10−5. A phenomeno-
logical expression containing excitation and ionization parts was used to ﬁt the
integral spectra. As a result, the shapes of molecular excitation and ionization
spectra were extracted for both isotopes. There is no diﬀerence in extraction
spectra between hydrogen and deuterium molecules. The relative energy depen-
dence was extracted too. Two methods were used for this purpose: to take data
at two electron energies during one and the same gas ﬁll and to use a pressure
sensor Px for relative normalization of gas density in the pipe. Both methods
agree with each other and with the published empirical energy dependence. All
the obtained results will be used in data analysis to search for a sterile neutrino
in tritium beta decay.

The important result of this experiment is that energy loss spectrum shape
and the excitation to ionization ratio do not depend on the incident electron
energy in the investigated energy range. This fact will be further used in simu-
lations of the ”Troitsk nu-mass” setup.
