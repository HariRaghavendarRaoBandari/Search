In this paper, we investigate the electron Landau-level stability and its inﬂuence on the
electron Fermi energy, EF(e), in the circumstance of magnetars, which are powered by
magnetic ﬁeld energy. In a magnetar, the Landau levels of degenerate and relativistic
electrons are strongly quantized. A new quantity gn, the electron Landau-level stability
coeﬃcient is introduced. According to the requirement that gn decreases with increasing
the magnetic ﬁeld intensity B, the magnetic-ﬁeld index β in the expression of EF(e)
must be positive. By introducing the Dirac−δ function, we deduce a general formulae
for the Fermi energy of degenerate and relativistic electrons, and obtain a particular
solution to EF(e) in a superhigh magnetic ﬁeld. This solution has a low magnetic-ﬁeld
index of β = 1/6, compared with the previous one, and works when ρ ≥ 107 g cm−3
and Bcr ≪ B ≤ 1017 Gauss. By modifying the phase space of relativistic electrons, a
superhigh magnetic ﬁeld can enhance the electron number density ne, and decrease the

maximum of electron Landau level number, which results in a redistribution of electrons.
According to Pauli exclusion principle, the degenerate electrons will ﬁll quantum states
from the lowest Landau level to the highest Landau level. As B increases, more and
more electrons will occupy higher Landau levels, though gn decreases with the Landau
level number n. The enhanced ne in a superhigh magnetic ﬁeld means an increase in the
electron Fermi energy and an increase in the electron degeneracy pressure. The results
are expected to facilitate the study of the weak interaction processes inside neutron stars
and the magnetic-thermal evolution mechanism for megnetars.

1. Introduction

It is universally recognized that pulsars are highly magnetized neutron stars (NSs),
with surface dipole magnetic ﬁeld being about 1010 − 1012 Gauss. Megnetars are a
kind of pulsars powered by their magnetic energy rather than their rotational en-
ergy, and their surface dipole magnetic ﬁelds are generally 2−3 orders of magnitude
higher than those of radio pulsars (B ∗ = B/Bcr ≫ 1, Bcr = 4.414 × 1013 Gauss
is the quantum critical ﬁeld of electrons), and their internal magnetic ﬁelds might
be even higher (e.g., see Ref.1). Megnetars are categorized into two populations
historically: Soft Gamma−ray Repeaters (SGRs) and Anomalous X−ray Pulsars
(AXPs). The SGR ﬂares were explained as resulting from violent magnetic recon-
nections and crustal quakes, and the quiescent X-ray emission of AXPs (with X-ray
luminosities much larger than their spin-down luminosities) was attributed to the
decay of superhigh magnetic ﬁelds (e.g., see Ref. 2, 3) under which the Landau
levels of electrons are strongly quantized.

For the completely degenerate and relativistic electrons in β−equilibrium, the
distribution function f (Ee) obeys Fermi-Dirac statistics (see Ref. 4). When the tem-
perature T → 0, the electron chemical potential µe is also called “the electron Fermi
energy”, EF(e), which has the simple form of E2
ec4, with pF(e)
being the electron Fermi momentum. As an extremely important and indispensable
physical parameter in the equation of state (EoS) of a NS, the Fermi energy of elec-
trons directly exerts impact on the weak-interactions processes, including modiﬁed
Urca reactions, β−decay, electron capture, as well as the absorption of neutrinos
and anti-neutrinos, etc (see Ref. 5, 6). They will in turn inﬂuence the intrinsic EoS,
internal structure, thermal evolution, and even the overall properties of the star (see
Ref. 7). Therefore, it is of great signiﬁcance to study EF(e) in the circumstance of
a NS.

F(e) = p2

Since EF(e) increases with the increasing in the depth of a NS (see Ref. 8),
it is necessary to brieﬂy review the structure of the star. The structure of a NS
roughly includes an atmosphere and four major internal regions: the outer crust,
inner crust, outer core, and inner core. The outer shell comprises crystal lattices
and electrons, which are distributed from the surface of the star to the region
where the neutron-drop density (see Ref. 9) ρd is reached. At the point ρ = ρd,

the neutrons begin to overﬂow from the nuclei, forming a free neutron gas, and
the value of EF(e) is about 25 MeV (see Ref. 9, 10). The inner shell is mainly
composed of degenerate and relativistic electrons, non-relativistic nucleons and over-
saturated neutrons, distributed from the region of neuron-drop density to the shell-
core boundary (ρ ∼ 0.5ρ0, ρ0 = 2.8 × 1014 g cm−3 is the standard nuclear density).
Nuclei fully disappear at this density, and EF(e) is about 35 MeV. The outer core is
composed of neutrons and a small amount of electrons and protons, with the density
range being 0.5ρ0 ∼ 2.5ρ0. The Fermi energy of electrons in this region is estimated
as EF(e) = 60 × (ρ/ρ0)2/3 MeV (see Ref. 8). For the region with higher density,
the electron Fermi energy could exceed the muon rest-mass energy mµc2 = 105.7
MeV, and a small amount of muons(µ) are detected. The inner core is about several
kilometers in radius, and has a central density as high as ∼ 1015 g cm−3. When
ρ > ρtr, some nucleons will transform to exotic particles such as hyperons pion
condensates, kaon condensates, quarks and etc, here ρtr is the transition density of
singular particles. To date, the value of ρtr is uncertain. For example, Tsuruta et
al.(2009) (see Ref. 11) gave an estimate ρtr ∼ 4ρ0.

What we are most interested in is how a superhigh magnetic ﬁeld can inﬂuence
Landau levels of degenerate and relativistic electrons and their Fermi energy. Many
authors (see Ref. 12, 13, 14, 15) have carried out detailed studies on the inﬂuences
of a superhigh magnetic ﬁeld on the composition and the EOS of a NS. According
to the requirement of quantization of Landau levels, we introduced the Dirac−δ
function (see Ref. 16, 17), and obtained a particular solution to EF(e),

where Ye is the electron fraction, which is deﬁned as Ye = ne/nB, where ne and nB
are the electron number density, and the baryon number density, respectively (see
Ref. 16, 17). Furthermore, we deduced a general expression for Pe, the pressure of
relativistic electrons (see Ref. 4), discussed the quantization of the electron Landau
levels, and explored the inﬂuence of quantum electrodynamics eﬀects on the EoS.
The main conclusions included: The higher the magnetic ﬁeld intensity, the bigger
the electron pressure, and the high pressure is caused by high Fermi energy of
electrons; the total pressure of a magnetar is always anisotropic; compared with an
ordinary radio pulsar, a magnestar might be a denser NS if the anisotropic total
pressure is taken into consideration; a magnestar might have larger mass if the
positive energy contribution of the magnetic ﬁeld energy to the EoS is taken into
consideration (see Ref. 4).

Our research results pose a challenge to the prevalent viewpoint (see Ref. 18, 19):
In a superhigh magnetic ﬁeld, the higher the magnetic ﬁeld intensity B, the lower the
electron Fermi energy and the electron pressure. This prevalent viewpoint essentially
goes against the real requirement of the quantization of landau levels, due to the
introduction of an artiﬁcial and false assumption and the application of the solution
of a non-relativistic electron cyclotron motion equation (see Ref. 4) for speciﬁc

information).

Recently, after a careful examination, we found some inadequacies of our theo-
retical model, mainly including the following aspects: 1) No consideration was given
to the stability of Landau levels of electrons in a strong magnetic ﬁeld. Till now,
there has yet been no any relevant works or explicit analytical expression on the
stability coeﬃcient gn in the physics community due to the complexity of this is-
sue; 2) No explicit analytic expression for EF(e) and ne was provided. There was
no comparison between the relationship of EF(e) and ne in a superhigh magnetic
ﬁeld with that in a weak magnetic ﬁeld approximation (B ∗ ≪ 1), based on which,
the variation range of the magnetic ﬁeld index β in the expression is deﬁned; 3)
In the expression of EF(e), the application scope of B was not clearly deﬁned be-
cause the Fermi surfaces (in the momentum space) of electrons in a non-relativistic
magnetic ﬁeld are basically spherically symmetrical, whereas the Fermi ball (in the
momentum space) is turned into Landau cylinder in a relativistic magnetic ﬁeld
(see Ref. 20, 21, 22); 4) The most important thing is that the physical meaning of
the magnetic ﬁeld index β (β = 1/4) in the expression of EF(e) (see Ref. 16, 17) is
not clear.

With the increase in the magnetic ﬁeld intensity, the Landau cylinder becomes
longer and narrower. When the superhigh magnetic ﬁeld is too high, the Landau
cylindrical space will be streamlined into a one-dimensional linear chain, making
our model no longer applicable. Simply speaking, much detailed information in our
previous works has been neglected (especially, ignoring the discrepancy of diﬀer-
ent Landau levels of electrons) in the process of derivation of EF(e) and/or Pe.
Therefore, it is of great importance to modify the expression EF(e) in a superhigh
magnetic ﬁeld.

This paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we review the relationship
between EF(e) and ne in the weak magnetic ﬁeld approximation; in Section 3, we
deduce a general expression of EF(e) in a superhigh magnetic ﬁeld by introducing
the stability coeﬃcient of the Landau levels, and modify the particular solution to
EF(e), and in Section 4, we present our summary and discussion.

2. The Fermi Energy in The Weak Magnetic Field Approximation

This part mainly refers to Ref. 7. Based on the basic deﬁnition of the Fermi energy
of relativistic electrons, we obtain a particular solution to EF(e),

EF(e) = 60 × (

ρ

)1/3(

(MeV).

(2)

which is suitable for relativistic electron matter region in a NS. It is obvious that
EF(e) increases with Ye and ρ in the weak magnetic ﬁeld approximation. By means
of numerical simulation, we obtained some analytic expressions of Ye and ρ for
several reliable EoSs with which we can estimate EF(e) at any matter density by
combining these analytical expressions with boundary conditions7.

Although EF(e) in a weak magnetic ﬁeld approximation could be expressed
as the function of Ye and ρ, the Fermi energy of electrons is solely determined
by the electron number density ne. Since electrons are extremely relativistic, the
dimensionless electron Fermi momentum xe = pF(e)/mec ≫ 1, then we obtained
the relationship between EF(e) and ne,

EF(e) = mec2(1 + x2

in a weak magnetic ﬁeld approximation, where λe = h/mec = 2.4263× 10−10 cm is
the electron Compton wavelength.
All the other Fermi parameters of electrons are also solely determined by the
number density of free electron gas, ne. For example, the electron Fermi momentum
pF(e) = kF = (3π2ne)1/3, where kF = (3π2ne)1/3 is the Fermi wave vector of
electrons. For the Fermi kinetic energy of relativistic electrons, EF
K (e) ≈ cpF(e) =
c(3π2ne)1/3, and EF
K(e) ≫ mec2). However, the relations between ne and ρ in
diﬀerent density regions of a NS are usually unknown, and the known relations of
ne and ρ depend on the EoS in some speciﬁc matter models, and on the analytical
expression of Ye and ρ obtained from the EOS in a certain matter model.

3. Electron Fermi Energy in a Superhigh Magnetic Field

3.1. Stability of Electron Landau Level

We now consider a uniform magnetic ﬁeld B directed along the z-axis. In this case,
in the Landau gauge the vector potential ~A reads ~A = (−By, 0, 0). For extremely
strong magnetic ﬁelds, the cyclotron energy becomes comparable to the electron
rest-mass energy, and the transverse motion of the electron becomes relativistic. A
relativistic magnetic ﬁeld is often called the quantum critical magnetic ﬁeld (Bcr =
ec3/e = 4.414×1013 Gauss), which is obtained from the relation ω = mec2. The

(8)

for highly degenerate electron gas in a superhigh magnetic ﬁeld (see Ref. 18). It
is obvious that the maximum of the electron Landau level number decreases with
B when EF(e) and pF
z (e) are given. This is because the higher the magnetic ﬁeld
intensity, the more unstable the Landau levels of electrons, and the bigger the
Landau level number n, the lower the Landau-level stability.

Indeed, the issue concerning the Landau-level stability of charged particles in a
superhigh magnetic ﬁeld is so complicated that there has not been any relevant work
or explicit analytical expression in the physics community. In our previous works
(see Ref. 16, 17), we did not take into consideration the Landau-level stability of
electrons in a superhigh magnetic ﬁeld that limits the application of our model.
In this work, a new quantity, gn, the Landau-level stability coeﬃcient of electrons
in a superhigh magnetic ﬁeld, is introduced. Considering the uncertainty of the
electron microscopic states in a superhigh magnetic ﬁeld, we assume that gn takes
the power-law form

gn = g0nα

(n ≥ 1),

(9)

where n, g0 and α are the Landau level number, the ground- state level stability
coeﬃcient, and the stability index of Landau levels of electrons, respectively. When
n = 1, g1 = g0, i.e., the ground-state level has the same stability as that of the ﬁrst
excited level. According to quantum mechanics, the electrons at a higher energy
level are prone to have excited transitions towards a lower energy level. The bigger
the Landau level number, the shorter the level-occupying time for electrons, and the
lower the Landau-level stability, the higher the probability of the excited transition.
Since the ground state level has the highest stability and gn decreases with
increasing n, i.e., gn < gn−1 < gn−2, the stability index α should be negative. The
main reasons are as follows: If α = 0, then gn = gn−1 = · · · = g1 = g0, i.e., all
the Landau levels have the same stability, and the maximum of the Landau level
number, nm, can take any high value. This scenario is essentially corresponding to

March 8, 2016 1:38 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE

MPLA2016

the weak magnetic ﬁeld approximation; if α > 0, then gn > gn−1 > · · · = g1 = g0,
and under such a condition, a higher Landau level number means a higher stability,
and n can also take any high value, which is clearly contrary to the principles of
quantum mechanics. According to the analysis above, for degenerate and relativistic
electrons in a superhigh magnetic ﬁeld, the Landau-level stability index, α < 0.
Based on Eq.(9), we make a schematic diagram of gn and α, shown in Fig. 1.

As seen from Fig.1, for a given Landau level with n ≥ 1, the level stability
coeﬃcient gn increases with α slowly, and the bigger the Landau level number n,
the faster the change of gn with α. From what we have discussed above, the bigger
the Landau level number n, the greater the inﬂuence of the stability index α on gn,
and the larger the probability of a particle’s transition from a higher energy level
into a lower energy level.

It should be pointed out that, in atomic physics and statistics mechanics (see
Ref. 23, 25) the statistical weight describes the energy state density of microscopic
particles, in other words, a higher energy level number means a bigger statistical
weight. The higher the quantum number ν, the wider the energy level width, and the
more the microscopic state number of particles is. Here the Landau-level stability
coeﬃcient for electrons and the statistical weight are two totally diﬀerent concepts.

3.2. The Energy State Density of Electrons in Phase Space

In a superhigh magnetic ﬁeld, the Fermi surface (in momentum space) of electrons
becomes a narrow Landau cylinder. Combining Bcr = m2

where µe ∼ 0.927× 10−20 ergs Gauss−1 is the magnetic moment of an electron. The
continuous physical variables px and py (see Ref. 20), adopted in a non-relativistic
magnetic ﬁeld, will be no longer applicable. Thus, a quantized or discrete rela-
tivistic variable p⊥ must be adopted for replacement, where p⊥ is the electron
momentum perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld, p⊥ = mec((2n + 1 + σ)B ∗)1/2. The
microscopic state number in a 6-dimension phase-space element dxdydzdpxdpydpz
is dxdydzdpxdpydpz/h3. By using the relation 2µeBcr/mec2 = 1 and summing over
the electron energy states in a 6-dimension phase space, we can express the electron
energy state density (the number of states occupied by completely degenerate and
relativistic electrons in a unit volume) Npha as follows

where δ(p⊥/mec − [(2n + 1 + σ)B ∗]1/2) is the Dirac-δ function for electrons in a
superhigh magnetic ﬁeld. The physical signiﬁcance of the Dirac-δ function lies in
that, there doesn’t exist any microscopic quantum state between the n-th and n+1-
th Landau torus due to the strong quantization of the electron Landau levels. For
the ground state level (n = 0), the electron spin is antiparallel to B, so the Landau
level is non-degenerate (n = 0, σ = −1); whereas higher levels are doubly degenerate
(n ≥ 1, σ = ±1). Thus Eq.(11) can be rewritten as

Note that if the matter density is so high that the electron longitudinal kinetic
energy exceeds its rest-mass energy, or if the magnetic ﬁeld is so high that the
electron cyclotron energy exceeds its rest-mass energy, then the electron becomes
relativistic. Here we introduce a ratio q(α), which is deﬁned as q(α) = I1/I2, I1 =

In order to modify the formula for EF(e) in a superhigh magnetic ﬁeld, let us refer to
the Pauli exclusion principle (PEP) (see Ref. 24). According to the PEP, there are
no two identical fermions occupying the same quantum state simultaneously, thus
highly degenerate electrons in a superhigh magnetic ﬁeld have to ﬁll quantum states
from the lowest Landau level (the ground-state level) to the highest Landau level.
In the mean time, according to quantum mechanics, the larger the electron Landau
level number n, the more unstable the electron Landau level, and the electrons at
a higher energy level are prone to have excited transitions towards a lower energy
level by losing energy (e.g., releasing photons).

As the energy of the highest occupied states, the electron Fermi energy corre-
sponds to the maximum electron Fermi momentum. The resulted electron degener-
acy pressure contributes a small fraction of the total dynamic pressure (mainly from
neutron degeneracy pressure) countering against gravity collapse of a NS. Thus, the
PEP not only explains higher energy levels of electrons, but also is responsible for
the stability of the NS matter. In a NS, the electron number density ne is determined
by

(19)
where NA = 6.02× 1023 is the Avogadro constant. According to the requirement of
PEP, the electron energy state number per unit volume equals the electron number
per unit volume, we get

Eq.(21) is a new general expression of EF(e) in a superhigh magnetic ﬁeld, where
1+α
2(α+2) describes the magnetic ﬁeld index of the expression. For the sake of conve-
nience, the magnetic ﬁeld index is denoted by a quantity β, β = 1+α

2(α+2) .

In order to discuss a reasonable range of the Landau-level stability index α, we
generate a schematic diagram of β and α. In Fig. 2, the dot-dashed line represents a
singular point of α = −2; the dashed line represents β = 0, corresponding to α = −1.

Fig. 2. The relation between β and α..

The physical signiﬁcance of α = −1 is that EF(e) does not change with the variation
of B, which equivalents to the case of the weak-magnetic ﬁeld approximation. The
reasonable range of α is thus estimated as α < 0 but α 6= −1, −2. From Fig.
2, one can easily judge the relationship between EF(e) and B: When α < −2 or
−1 < α < 0, the magnetic ﬁeld index β > 0, and EF(e) increases with B; when
−2 < α < −1, the magnetic ﬁeld index β < 0, and EF(e) decreases with B.

Whether β is a positive or negative number depends on the actual value of α.
From the relation of EF(e) and ne in the weak magnetic ﬁeld approximation, it can
be seen that EF(e) is solely determined by ne, and EF(e) ∝ n1/3
(refer to Eq.(3)
in Section 2). From the general expression of EF(e) in a superhigh magnetic ﬁeld
(Eq.(20)), we can see that EF(e) ∝ (B ∗)
, i.e., EF(e) bears the relation
not only to ne but also to B, and the latter has great inﬂuence on the former by
modifying the phase space of electrons. It is also worth noticing that, the dimension
of EF(e) always remains unchanged no matter in a weak magnetic ﬁeld or in a
superhigh magnetic ﬁeld, i.e., EF(e) is proportional to n1/3

. Thus, we obtain

by comparing Eq.(3) with Eq.(21). Solving Eq.(22) yields α = −0.5, which lies in a
reasonable range of α, as estimated above. Inserting α = −0.5 into Eq.(22), we get
the magnetic ﬁeld index β = 1/6. Compared with Eq.(1), the value of β obtained
in this paper decreases by 1/12. In spite of the minimum disparity, the modiﬁed
magnetic ﬁeld index is obviously superior to that of previous one (see Ref. 16, 17).
This is because, in our previous works (see Ref. 16, 17), the magnetic ﬁeld index β
(β = 1/4) corresponds to α = 0, which means that diﬀerent Landau levels have the

March 8, 2016 1:38 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE

same stability, and the diﬀerences between two diﬀerent Landau levels are neglected.
In order to obtain an analytic expression for EF(e) in a superhigh magnetic
ﬁeld, we assume that the ground state level has the highest stability, and the max-
imum value of gn is g0 = 1. This provides us with much convenience for theoretical
derivations. Then the electron Landau-level stability coeﬃcient (see Eq.(7)) can be
expressed as g1 = g0 = 1, (n = 0, 1) and gn = n− 1

the magnetic eﬀects. Eq.(23) is a newly modiﬁed general expression for EF(e) and
ne in a superhigh magnetic ﬁeld.

By modifying the phase space of relativistic electrons, a superhigh magnetic ﬁeld
can enhance ne, and decrease the maximum of electron Landau level number, re-
sulting in a redistribution of electrons. As mentioned above, the strongly degenerate
electrons have to occupy all possible microscopic states up to the highest Landau
level, due to the requirement of the PEP. As B increases, more and more electrons
will occupy higher Landau levels (including the highest landau level), though gn
decreases with the Landau level number n. The enhanced ne in a superhigh mag-
netic ﬁelds means an increase in EF(e), corresponding to an increase in the electron
degeneracy pressure.

If B is too high, e.g., B > 1017 Gauss, the Landau cylinder will continuously
elongate in the direction of B, and could become a narrow electron chain, then
the maximum Landau level number is estimated to be nm = 1 or 2. Under such
circumstances, the premise of theoretical derivations in this paper will no longer
apply. Thus the applicable conditions for Eq.(23) are limited by ρ ≥ 107 g cm−3
and Bcr ≪ B ≤ 1017 Gauss.
The Fermi energy of electrons in a magnetar is related to Ye, ρ and B. Inserting
ne = NAYeρ into Eq.(23), we obtain a newly modiﬁed particular solution to EF(e)

MeV, respectively when B ∗ = 100, 50, and 10, respectively.

In order to compare the modiﬁed particular solution to EF(e) with that in our
previous works (see Ref. 17), we make schematic diagrams of EF(e) and B, as shown
in Fig.4.

When ρ = ρ0, and B ∼ (5.0 × 1013 − 1.0 × 1016) Gauss, we calculate the values
of EF(e) to be (60.34 − 145.92) MeV, and (46.1 − 134.83) MeV, respectively, by
using Eq.(24) and Eq.(1), respectively. Fig. 4 clearly shows that the value of EF(e)
obtained with Eq.(24) is slightly bigger than that obtained with Eq.(2). This is
mainly because that both the Fermi energy coeﬃcient (59.1 MeV) and the density
index (1/3) in Eq.(24) are higher than those in Eq.(1), although the magnetic ﬁeld
index β in Eq.(24) is lower than that in Eq.(2).

4. Summary and Discussion

By introducing the stability coeﬃcient of the electron Landau levels, we re-derive the
general expression of EF(e) in a superhigh magnetic ﬁeld, and obtained a modiﬁed
particular solution to EF(e). The solution has a lower magnetic ﬁeld index of β =
1/6, which is lower than the previous one by a factor of 1/12. Since there exists the
discrepancy of stability in diﬀerent Landau levels, we believe that this solution to
EF(e) is superior to the previous one (see Ref. 16, 17).

Just like in the weak magnetic ﬁeld approximation, the value of the electron
Fermi energy is determined solely by the electron number density. A superhigh

Fig. 4. The relations of EF(e) and B in superhigh magnetic ﬁelds. The range of B is (5.0 × 1013 −
1.0 × 1016) Gauss. In order to facilitate the calculation, the matter density is assumed as ρ = ρ0,
arbitrarily. The solid line and the dot-dashed line are ﬁtted by Eq.(24) and Eq.(1), respectively.

magnetic ﬁeld modiﬁes the phase space of electrons, and thus increases the electron
number density. The possible reasons are as follows:

(I) According to the requirement of electrical neutrality, the simple neutron
decay and continuous electron capture occur simultaneously in the interior of a NS.
However, a superhigh magnetic ﬁeld will cause the former process to be faster than
the latter (see Ref. 26). Since more neutrons in a superhigh magnetic ﬁeld will be
converted into protons, the proton fraction Yp (Yp = Ye) will increases, and the
electron number density (ne = NAYeρ) will also increase correspondingly.

(II) According to nuclear physics, the proton fraction describes the asymmetry
of nuclear matter, and the value of Yp bears close relation to the symmetry en-
ergy, the symmetrical energy gradient, the incompressible coeﬃcient, the volume
bound energy and other parameters of nuclear matter (see Ref. 27, 28). A super-
high magnetic ﬁeld may increase the asymmetry of nuclear matter and improve the
proton fraction. Thus, the average electron density of nuclear matter also increases
correspondingly.

Although the structure, properties and EoS of nuclear matter are strongly in-
ﬂuenced by a superhigh magnetic ﬁeld, there has been no relevant and detailed
research results in physics community, the study on how a superhigh magnetic ﬁeld
inﬂuences the asymmetry (the inﬂuence on the proton abundance in particular) of
nuclear matter will become one of our future research directions.

Since the electron Fermi energy is one of most important parameters of EoS, a su-
perhigh magnetic ﬁeld will inﬂuence the EoS of a NS, as well as on the electron Fermi
energy. Meanwhile, the particular solution to the electron Fermi energy obtained in

this paper will surely inﬂuence calculations of the neutron-decay rates, the electron
capture rates and the soft X-ray luminosity of a magnetar (see Ref. 16, 29, 17, 30).
As known to all, the cooling processes of a NS can be categorized into direct
Urca and modiﬁed Urca reactions (see Ref. 31). Theoretical research shows that,
direct Urca reactions in a ordinary NS with B ≪ Bcr are strongly suppressed by
Pauli blocking in a system composed of neutrons, protons and electrons, due to a
high threshold (see Ref. 32, 33, 34, 35, 36) for the proton fraction Yp ≥1/9. Direct
Urca reactions could take place (see Ref. 37, 18, 31) in the core of a supermassive
NS, where Yp could be higher than 0.11. However, when in a superhigh magnetic
ﬁeld B ≫ Brmcr, things could be quite diﬀerent if we take into account of the eﬀect
of the superhigh magnetic ﬁeld on Yp. This paper will be very useful in the future
study on direct Urca reactions in the circumstances of magnetars.

Modiﬁed Urca reactions are usually referred to as the standard cooling process
(see Ref. 31), in which the energy loss caused by resulting neutrinos plays an im-
portant role in the thermal evolution of a NS. Observations show that the surface
thermal temperatures of most of high-magnetic ﬁeld pulsars (see Ref. 38) are higher
than those of ordinary radio pulsars with same characteristic ages. It is found that,
the surface temperatures of magnetars (see Ref. 39, 40, 41, 44, 42 43) are also
signiﬁcantly higher than those of ordinary radio pulsars (see Ref. 44, 45). These ob-
servation ﬁndings not only challenge the standard cooling theory but also strongly
hint that the magnetic ﬁeld evolution and the thermal evolution of a magnetar are
closely related, and the surface thermal temperature of a magnetar might be posi-
tively correlated with the magnetic ﬁeld. The results of this paper will facilitate the
theoretical research on magneto-thermal evolution of magnetars.

It is expected that in the near future, our results will contribute to improving
the standard model of neutron star cooling (see Ref. 31), and will be tested and
developed by comparing the improved neutron star cooling model with magnetar
spectrum observations
