Abstract

A modiﬁed, deterministic SEIR model is developed for the 2014 Ebola epidemic occurring
in the West African nations of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. The model describes the
dynamical interaction of susceptible and infected populations, while accounting for the eﬀects
of hospitalization and the spread of disease through interactions with deceased, but infectious,
individuals. Using data from the World Health Organization (WHO), parameters within the
model are ﬁt to recent estimates of infected and deceased cases from each nation. The model is
then analyzed using these parameter values. Finally, several metrics are proposed to determine
which of these nations is in greatest need of additional resources to combat the spread of infec-
tion. These include local and global sensitivity metrics of both the infected population and the
basic reproduction number with respect to rates of hospitalization and proper burial.

1 Introduction

The most recent Ebola outbreak began in December 2013 and resulted in a devastating loss of life
in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. This outbreak has been the deadliest in the history of the
disease claiming more than 10, 000 lives to date [2]. The severity of the epidemic has prompted an
international response to halt further spread of the disease. In particular, eﬀorts arising within the
United States and China have provided additional relief to the region, but within 2014 this had
not been enough to end the epidemic.

Some basic facts about Ebola disease pathogenesis are well known. Those exposed to the virus
experience an 8-to-10 day incubation period during which they remain noninfectious, though the
time between exposure and the onset of symptoms ranges from 2 to 21 days [6]. Once a patient
becomes symptomatic, the virus may be transferred to others through direct contact with bodily
ﬂuids, such as blood and vomit. One important epidemiological feature of Ebola is that those
who are killed by the disease can still transmit the virus to susceptible individuals. Unlike most
pathogens, which cannot survive long on a deceased individual, Ebola does remain infectious after
a person succumbs to the disease [6]. In fact, the deceased are even more contagious than living
Ebola patients as the virus can force a victim’s body to release infectious ﬂuids including blood,
vomit, and fecal matter - especially in later stages of the disease. This ﬂuid release is among the
most visually harrowing symptoms of Ebola, present in some late-stage patients [6].

The spread of infection from deceased to susceptible individuals is a signiﬁcant problem in
Western Africa where local burial rituals often require washing, touching, or kissing the body of
the deceased. Among the traditional practices the WHO cautions against with Ebola victims
are family-led body preparation and religious rituals that require direct contact with the corpse.
Muslim tradition, for instance, requires that family members of the same gender wash the body
themselves before burial. Moreover, the lack of adequate health care within Guinea, Liberia, and
Sierra Leone has perpetuated the disease, as improper and unsafe burials place further individuals
at risk. Widespread reports from Liberia in late 2014 described Ebola victims laying on the streets
for days, drastically increasing the risk of infection [14]. The WHO estimates that contact with
deceased individuals has caused at least 20% of all infections [15]. Hence, the bodies of deceased
Ebola victims that have not been properly disposed and burial ceremonies, in which mourners have
direct contact with the body of the deceased, can play a large role in the transmission of the virus,
and these eﬀects cannot be neglected within an informative model.

Another important feature is the eﬀect of hospitalization. Due to their frequent interaction with
patients either under investigation or conﬁrmed to have contracted the Ebola virus, healthcare per-
sonnel are particularly susceptible to the disease.
In particular, they can be exposed to Ebola
by coming in contact with a patient’s body ﬂuids, contaminated medical supplies and equipment,
or contaminated environmental surfaces. For these reasons transmission between infectious, hos-
pitalized individuals and medical workers are non-negligible within a descriptive epidemic model.
Additionally, hospitalization and subsequent treatment does improve an infected patient’s chances
of recovery, and an increase in the use of medical facilities within a population can reduce the
damage caused by the epidemic.

While previous studies have focused predominantly on the eﬀects of contact tracing [11, 13], it
has recently been determined [9] that other aspects of disease pathogenesis, including hospitaliza-
tion, case isolation, and further introduction of sanitary funeral processes, must be better addressed
in order to fully mitigate further spread of the disease. Hence, the ultimate goal of the current
study is to construct a model for the most recent Ebola epidemic in Western African and identify
useful metrics to determine which of the aﬀected countries would beneﬁt most from the allocation
of additional resources, including new treatment facilities or greater manpower to ensure proper
burials. To this end, a deterministic model for the epidemic is constructed in the next section by
accounting for the speciﬁc characteristics of the disease, including the incubation period, increased
risk of infection from deceased individuals, and the eﬀects of hospitalization. Realistic parameter
values are determined by ﬁtting to given data for each of the nations and a separate analysis of
the respective reproduction numbers is conducted. In Section 3 we discuss local metrics other than
direct computation of the basic reproduction number (R0) which may allow one to determine the
optimal sites for resource allocation and inhibit the spread of the disease. These metrics include
ﬁtted parameter values, the local sensitivity of the infectious population, and the local minimization
of R0 with respect to parameter variation. Within Section 4 we propose and explore a new method
to compute the global sensitivity of R0 with respect to alterations in the most crucial parameter
values. Ultimately, we ﬁnd that of these three troubled nations, it is Liberia that would beneﬁt
most from the introduction of additional medical resources. In general, these tools - especially the
proposed activity scores of Section 4 - can be used to analyze future outbreaks in addition to the
most recent crisis. Finally, the relevant details of computations are contained within an appendix.

2 A Mathematical Model for Ebola

Our ﬁrst objective is to develop a mathematical model for the spread of Ebola in Western Africa by
accounting for the speciﬁc characteristics of the disease. SEIR models are often implemented when
studying the spread of infectious diseases that possess signiﬁcant incubation periods [7, 11, 13]. To
describe the spread of Ebola, a traditional SEIR model is augmented with additional compartments

based on the following assumptions. First, as the number of susceptibles is large, we neglect
stochastic eﬀects and formulate a deterministic model. Additionally, though the current epidemic
has lasted for over a year, we assume that the outbreak is not sustained by the introduction of
new susceptible individuals. Hence, national populations are near equilibrium and both births and
deaths are neglected amongst the total population. We further assume that infected individuals can
move to three diﬀerent removed compartments: removed and infectious (i.e. not properly buried),
removed and properly buried, and removed and recovered. This distinction is introduced to allow
for the scenario in which individuals who have died from the disease, but have not been properly
buried, may continue to infect susceptible individuals whom they contact.

We assume that those who recover from the disease are no longer susceptible, as survivors of
Ebola are thought to be immune to the strain of the virus that infected them [3]. Once hospitalized,
infected individuals can still spread the disease to members of the susceptible population. However,
we assume that patients who die within a hospital receive an immediate proper burial, and thus
cannot infect others once deceased. Finally, we assume that hospitalized individuals have a greater
chance of survival than infected, non-hospitalized individuals [6]. This is consistent with estimates
of the general Ebola fatality rate around 70% and the hospitalized fatality rate near 64% [1].

2.1 A Modiﬁed SEIR Model

With the aforementioned assumptions identiﬁed, we formulate a modiﬁed SEIR model to account
for the dynamics of the disease within a population. The model consists of the following seven
states, each a function of time t: (i) the susceptible proportion of the population S(t), (ii) the
exposed proportion (i.e., infected but asymptomatic) E(t), (iii) the infected proportion I(t), (iv)
the infected and hospitalized proportion H(t), (v) the removed but infectious proportion (i.e., those
who died from the disease but have not been sanitarily buried) RI (t), (vi) the removed and buried
proportion RB(t), and (vii) the removed and recovered proportion RR(t).

There are several ways in which the populations may be altered. First, susceptibles transfer

to the exposed population after coming into contact with either an infected individual (including
those who are hospitalized) or a body which is improperly buried. After the viral incubation
period, all exposed individuals move to the infected population. The infected move to one of three
populations: hospitalized, removed and infectious, or removed and recovered. Note that infected
individuals cannot move immediately to a removed and buried state since we assume that some
time is needed to bury an individual not receiving medical care at death. However, a proportion of
removed and infectious individuals transfer to removed and buried. Hospitalized individuals move
to either removed and buried or removed and recovered. Finally, all transmission terms are assumed
to be of mass-action form. Figure 1 summarizes these transition pathways between populations,
while Table 1 summarizes model parameters—all of which are nonnegative.

With RB and RR accounted for, the model is conservative, and compartments have been rescaled
so that each represents the proportion of a speciﬁc population with respect to the total population.
For example, denoting the total population constant by N = S + E + I + H + RI + RB + RR so

data for each nation from WHO Situation reports [16] and the Network Dynamics and Simulation
Science Laboratory at Virginia Tech [10]. The data sets contain cumulative values of infections
and deaths from each nation. However, the data are incomplete and/or irregularly reported; hence,
we remove outliers and time periods without suﬃcient reporting. The remaining number of data
points are 36, 90, and 61 for Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone, respectively.

Since the data represent cumulative quantities, but the model describes instantaneous propor-
tions of active infections, and diﬀering compartments are employed in our model for deaths, a direct
ﬁt is not immediately possible. Instead, to generate cumulative quantities, the time-integrated in-
fected population was ﬁt to the cumulative infected data. Also, our model includes three deceased
states, while the data do not diﬀerentiate among diﬀering death compartments. Thus, we assume
reported deaths in the data correspond to the properly buried population RB, and not the deceased
but infectious population RI , as the latter are likely unknown to data collectors.

To ﬁt the model parameters, an unconstrained nonlinear optimization was performed using
MATLAB’s fminsearch function, which utilizes a Nelder-Mead direct search method. Within
this solver nonlinear parameter constraints were enforced by using a barrier function to ensure
positive, realistic parameter values. The objective function, D(p), where p represents the vector of
parameters deﬁned in Table 1, is deﬁned as

D(p) :=

[Rdata(t) − N · RB(t; p)]2 +

where T is the discrete set of times at which the data is available, N is the total population for
a given nation, Rdata(t) is the recorded number of cumulative deceased individuals, and Cdata(t)
is the recorded number of cumulative infections. The initial conditions are the proportions as of
March 22, 2014. For example, the total estimated population of Liberia is N = 4.29 million, while
the number of reported infections on this date was 9, and hence I(0) = 9/(4.29× 106) = 2.1× 10−6.
Table 2 displays the ﬁtted parameter values for each independent country. Estimates of the
incubation period range between 8 and 10 days, so the daily probability of transition from the
exposed state to the infected state was assumed to be δ = 1
9 for simplicity. Figure 2 displays model
trajectories with ﬁtted parameters compared to the available data for Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra
Leone.

With parameter values established, the basic reproduction number (i.e., the average number

this quantity is found to be

.

(4)

We note that this quantity is independent of the parameters δ and ρ2 since neither the length of
the incubation period nor the death rate of hospitalized patients aﬀects the generation of secondary
infected cases. Utilizing ﬁtted parameter values the basic reproduction number for each nation was
computed, as expressed within Table 3. Liberia appears to be experiencing the greatest detrimental
eﬀects of the epidemic, as evidenced by this metric, but the corresponding value for Sierra Leone
is nearly as large, while Guinea does not diﬀer too dramatically from the others. Without further
intervention and new allocation of resources to ﬁght the disease, our model predicts that the
epidemic would continue to spread as of December 2014, generating a large number of new cases
each day - 23 in Guinea, 119 in Sierra Leone, and 736 in Liberia.

used to compute these values, namely Liberia - 72.3% (unhospitalized), 67% (hospitalized) and Sierra Leone - 69%
(unhospitalized) and 61.4% (hospitalized).

3 Local Metrics for resource allocation

Given the limited amount of resources available to these West African nations and the diminishing
availability of external aid from charitable organizations around the world, a natural question to
investigate is which of the nations currently experiencing an epidemic would beneﬁt most from
additional hospitalization and treatment resources. Thus, another major goal of this work is to
study diﬀerent metrics by which such decisions can be accurately established. Certainly, one way
to answer this question is to compare the computed basic reproduction numbers for each region
and allocate new resources to the one whose R0 value is largest. However, this single value may
not always capture a necessary level of detail within infection dynamics and doesn’t account for
parameter variation due to intervention. Hence, in this section we investigate both changes to R0
and a few other possible metrics to determine the placement and allocation of new resources.

3.1 Fitted Parameter Values

Computing some of the speciﬁc mean times and probabilities (see Table 4) can provide a preliminary
understanding of the epidemic. These quantities were derived directly from estimates of fatality
rates provided by [1] and the parameter values (Table 2) ﬁt to the data. For instance, the average
time from patient hospitalization to death was computed using the parameters ρ2 and γ2. Namely,
if tHD represents this average time, and the fatality rate of all hospitalized cases in Liberia is 67%, as
reported in [1], then the term ρ2γ2 within (1) can be represented as the product of the probability
that a hospitalized patient dies and the average rate at which a patient exits the hospitalized
population due to death, or

ρ2γ2 = 0.67 · 1
tHD

.

Using the ﬁtted values of ρ2 and γ2 in Liberia, one can uniquely determine tHD. In the same way, the
ﬁt parameters ρ1, γ1, ψ, and ω were used to determine the remaining stated mean times for Liberia
and Sierra Leone. These rates were not computed for Guinea as the behavior of the epidemic in
this nation diﬀers dramatically from the others, as noted in [11]. Because of this diﬀerence and the
comparatively small value of R0, we will disregard the spread of the disease within Guinea for the
remainder of the paper.

Figure 3: Contour plots of R0(ψ, ω). Parameters were varied from one-half their ﬁtted value to four times this
number. The black square represents the ﬁt parameter pair (ψ0, ω0).

Notice that Sierra Leone was determined to possess the longest average time from hospitalization
to recovery and a larger percentage of hospitalized cases, while Liberia experiences the longer wait
for proper burials on average. The two nations experience similar wait times for hospitalization. We
further note that neither possesses uniformly larger infection rates, as transmission from the infected
and hospitalized populations is largest in Liberia, but transmissions from deceased individuals is
greatest in Sierra Leone. In addition, the number of infectious individuals and the rate of growth of
the deceased population is largest within Liberia (Fig. 2). Other quantities, such as the proportion
of the total population stricken with the disease, could also be considered. In general, parameter
values alone, even when determined directly from the infected and deceased data sets, likely cannot
determine the country most in need of additional resources.

3.2 Greatest Reduction in R0

Since an analysis of the basic reproduction number is a traditional metric to characterize the spread
of disease, it is a natural quantity to consider reducing through intervention. In Section 2, values
of R0 were computed for each of the three nations. As a function of parameters within the model,
the basic reproduction number is expressed by (4).

Until new pharmaceutical and enhanced medical treatments are developed, it appears that the
parameters ρ1, ρ2, γ1, and γ2 cannot be greatly altered by the allocation of additional resources.
Similar statements hold true for the infection parameters (β1, β1, β3) and incubation period (δ),
which are all determined inherently by population interactions and the disease itself. The parame-
ters over which one has the greatest immediate control and are most strongly altered by the addition
of human resources are the hospitalization parameter ψ and rate of proper burial ω. Hence, we
may ﬁx the other parameters in the system and view R0 as a function of ψ and ω. Then, the local
rate of change of R0 with respect to these parameters should provide insight into the eﬃcacy of an
increase in either resource. Using (4), we compute

and because all parameters are positive, this quantity must be negative as well. With respect to
these parameters the quantity of interest for a nation is the marginal decrease in R0 created by an
increase in the current values of ψ or ω, which we denote by ψ0 and ω0 respectively. Computed values
of the partial derivatives and the magnitude of the respective gradients are displayed in Table 5.
Additionally, contour plots for the two nations are displayed in Figure 3. They clearly demonstrate
that the inﬂuence of ψ is much greater than that of ω. Hence, an increase in the hospitalization
of infected individuals would have a signiﬁcantly greater impact on the reproduction number than
devoting more resources to ensuring quick and proper burials of the deceased. Therefore, we reduce
the problem to viewing R0 as a function of ψ alone and investigate the relative impact that an
increase in ψ may have on R0. Hence, we ﬁx ω = ω0 and compute R(cid:48)
0(ψ0) for each of the three
0(ψ) < 0 for all ψ ≥ 0, the
countries, the values of which are represented within Table 6. Since R(cid:48)
minimal value of R0 is obtained by

while the maximal value occurs when no medical intervention is present and is

These respective values are also provided within Table 6. The information described by R(cid:48)
0(ψ)
suggests that additional medical resources to boost the hospitalization parameter, and hence reduce
the average time to hospitalization, will signiﬁcantly impact both Liberia and Sierra Leone, with a
slightly greater beneﬁt to the former nation in comparison to the latter.

3.3 Local Sensitivity of the Infected Population

Another possible metric is the change in the infected population as a function of the hospitalization
parameter ψ. As mentioned within the previous section, this parameter appears to be one of the
most controllable factors of the disease’s progression, and as we will show in the next section, it is
the most inﬂuential in terms of the value of R0. Hence, to conduct a local sensitivity analysis of the
infected population as a function of ψ only, we ﬁx all model parameters to their ﬁtted value except
for ψ. In particular, since this function I(t; ψ) is also time-dependent we must rely on simulations
of the system to approximate changes in this output over a period of time. This method was
implemented with changes in ψ made at two diﬀering points in time for Liberia and Sierra Leone.
In both implementations the parameter ψ is varied between one half and twice its ﬁtted value.

Figure 4: Reproduction numbers by nation. R0 as a function of hospitalization parameter (left) and the derivative
of R0 with respect to hospitalization parameter (right). The circles represent the values of these quantities at the
hospitalization level obtained from data.

The ﬁrst implementation focuses on changes in I(t; ψ) arising from varying ψ at time t = 0,
the beginning of the outbreak. Figure 5 depicts the results of this analysis.
In both countries,
we see that increased values of ψ correspond to decreases in I. However, increasing ψ in Liberia
produces a greater decrease in the infected population compared to that of Sierra Leone. This is
evident due to the scales of the graphs in Figure 5. The second implementation focuses on changes
in I(t; ψ) arising from altering the hospitalization parameter at the ﬁnal recorded time of the data
set, thereby simulating the implementation of new treatment strategies at the most recent time.
The initial conditions used for future forecasting are given by the last day of the data set. For each
value of ψ we forecast the model ﬁfty days into the future. Figure 6 summarizes the forecasting
sensitivity analysis. Again, within both countries we see that increasing ψ reduces I(t, ψ), but the
reduction in Liberia is much greater than in Sierra Leone.

Hence, from this metric we conclude that variations in the hospitalization rate have a signiﬁcant
impact on the rate of infection within both Sierra Leone and Liberia. However, the largest impact
is in the country of Liberia. A 30 percent increase in ψ leads to a nearly 1000 fewer infectious
individuals in Liberia by the end of the forecasting simulation, while the same increase in Sierra
Leone would result in a couple hundred fewer infectious individuals.

4 Global Metrics for resource allocation

Though the local sensitivity analyses of the previous section were informative, none eﬀectively
captures the eﬀects of large variations in model parameters on the quantity of interest. For instance,
when one evaluates the partial derivative of the reproductive ratio with respect to parameters it
must be done at a speciﬁc point x in the input parameter space. Within the context of the Ebola
model, input parameters can be represented by x = (β1, β2, β3, ρ1, γ1, γ2, ω, ψ) ∈ R8, while the input
parameter space Ω ⊂ R8 is deﬁned by the ranges of each parameter in x as summarized in Table 7.
Of course, the previous methods measured local sensitivity because model input parameters were
perturbed about a speciﬁc point x ∈ Ω in order to understand their eﬀect on variations in the model
output, e.g. ∂R0
∂ψ (x). Contrastingly, global sensitivity metrics account for parameter variation across
the entire input space Ω. Much like local measures of sensitivity, investigating the global eﬀects
of input parameters can allow us to establish a relative notion of importance among the model

inputs. One class of global sensitivity methods, known as active subspace methods, are particularly
useful for models with a scalar quantity of interest [4, 5]. As the usual quantity of interest in
epidemiological models is the scalar reproduction number R0 and this is a strong indicator of the
behavior of the disease, we will utilize active subspaces to perform a global sensitivity analysis of
R0(x).
To simplify our calculations we ﬁrst shift and scale the parameter space of dimension eight
to the hypercube [−1, 1]8 and equip it with a uniform probability density, ρ(x) = 2−8. Then,
active subspaces of the parameter space are deﬁned in terms of the eigenpairs of the 8× 8 positive,

Intervals of parameter values for Liberia and Sierra Leone. Each of these parameters deﬁne the dimensions
of the input parameter space Ω. Because this is a novel model, exact intervals for each parameter are neither known

ﬁtting parameter values in Section 3.1. We used data from [1] to construct estimates of the remaining parameter
intervals.

Notice that if λi = 0 for some i = 1, . . . , 8, then R0 is constant along the direction wi, and therefore
no change in this model output occurs from variations along the wi direction of the parameter input
space. Such structure can be exploited to reduce the dimension of the model. For instance, suppose
λn+1 (cid:28) λn for some n < 7. Then, we partition the orthogonal decomposition of C into

(cid:20)Λ1

, W =(cid:2)W1 W2

(cid:3) ,

Λ2

Λ =

(7)
where Λ1 is a diagonal matrix of the ﬁrst n eigenvalues, and W1 is the 8 × n matrix containing
the ﬁrst n eigenvectors. To identify an active subspace, we must estimate the eigenpairs Λ, W and
identify a gap amongst the eigenvalues. Because the dimension of our parameter space is relatively
small we use high order numerical integration rules to estimate C in (5). More speciﬁcally, we use
tensor product Gauss-Legendre quadrature on 88 points (eight per parameter dimension).

Next, deﬁne α ∈ R8 by

α = α(n) =

λj w2
j ,

(8)

j=1

where the exponent on the vector wj denotes an elementwise exponentiation, i.e. within each
component of wj. The entries of the vector α(n) are referred to as the activity scores of C, and we
use these numbers to rank the importance of the input parameters for the quantity of interest R0.
The active subspace’s construction provides insight into the interpretation of the activity scores [4,
Chapter 3]. Namely, the eigenvector w1 identiﬁes the most important direction in the parameter
space in the following sense: perturbing x along w1 changes R0 more, on average, than perturbing
x orthogonal to w1, as demonstrated in (6). The components of w1 measure the relative change
in each component of x along this most important direction, so they impart signiﬁcance to each
component of x. The second most important direction is the eigenvector w2, and the relative
importance of w2 is measured by the diﬀerence between the eigenvalues λ1 and λ2. For example,
if λ1 (cid:29) λ2, then R0(x) possesses a dominant one-dimensional active subspace, and the importance
of the components of x is captured by the components of w1. Therefore, to construct this global
sensitivity metric, it is reasonable to scale each eigenvector by its corresponding eigenvalue.

The results of computing the eigenvalues λi (i = 1, ..., 8) and pertinent eigenvector w1 for C are
presented in Figures 7 and 8, respectively. Notice that eigenvalues are displayed on a log scale, and

Figure 7: Magnitudes of the eigenvalues Λ from (5) on a logscale. The gap between the second and third eigenvalues
for both Liberia and Sierra Leone suggests a two-dimensional active subspace, i.e., n = 2. The computation of the
matrix C = W ΛW T in (5) (and therefore the eigenvalues) is done via tensor product Gauss-Legendre quadrature
on 88 points (eight per parameter dimension).

thus a notable (nearly two orders of magnitude) spectral gap occurs between λ1 and λ2 for each
nation. Hence, w1 displays the parameters of greatest global importance to R0, and we see that
it is ψ which is responsible for the greatest decrease in this output variable within either country.
This further justiﬁes the omission of variations in other parameters within the local analysis of
previous sections since, on average, they inﬂuence R0 much less than ψ. As an additional beneﬁt
of the active subspace method, we note that the computed activity score is actually independent
of the values of parameters estimated from the data, e.g. ω0 and ψ0. Instead, we merely require
a suitable range of parameter values in order to implement the method, and this can be much
easier to obtain than a realistic ﬁt of parameters from case data which tracks infected and deceased
individuals. As noted within Table 7 the intervals for these parameter values are easily obtained
as rate coeﬃcients from compiled statistics [1], such as the mean time from infection to recovery
or infection to death.

Revisiting Figure 7, a logical argument can be made that an even larger spectral gap occurs
within λ2 and λ3 for each nation. Thus, we have computed the corresponding activity scores α(2)
for each country and the resulting vector is shown in Figure 9. Here, we see that the activity
score for ψ within both α(1) and α(2) is signiﬁcantly greater within Sierra Leone than in Liberia.
This result suggests that if resources can be allocated so that the hospitalization rate within either
country is altered enough to render its current (or ﬁtted) value insigniﬁcant, then the basic repro-
duction number would experience a greater decrease by increasing the hospitalization rate in Sierra
Leone rather than Liberia. Thus, the beneﬁt of the active subspace method becomes clear - if large
variations of model input parameters are realistic, then the global sensitivity metric provided by
this method serves as a better decision-making tool than a classical, derivative-based local sensi-
tivity approach. In the former situation, the analysis suggests that allocating more resources for
hospitalization within Sierra Leone would have a larger impact than doing so within Liberia.

5 Conclusions and Future Work

To gain insight into the spread of the most recent Ebola epidemic within Western Africa, a mod-
iﬁed SEIR model was constructed that incorporates the eﬀects of interaction amongst infectious

In both countries, the parameter ψ is by far the most inﬂuential on the reproductive ratio. We may also conclude
that the parameters β2, ρ1, and ω have neglible inﬂuence on R0 in both Liberia and Sierra Leone. The computation
of the matrix C = W ΛW T in (5) (and therefore the activity scores) is done via tensor product Gauss-Legendre

individuals, including those who have succumb to the disease, and the population of susceptible
individuals. Upon creating the model, parameter values were ﬁt to known WHO case data [16]
gathered between March and December 2014 for Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Local metrics
were then proposed to determine the optimal location for the allocation of additional medical re-
sources. Finally, a novel global sensitivity metric was proposed and explored to allow for a greater
understanding of model output responses to changes within input parameters. The former analy-
sis clearly established that Liberia would most beneﬁt, via a reduced R0, from an increase in the
hospitalization rate. All of the software used to develop these tools has been compiled at

and is freely available to any parties wishing to further the results of the article.

Given the results of the previous sections, one must conclude that the optimal placement for
treatment facilities in Western Africa depends largely on the amount of new resources that can be
devoted to a speciﬁc country. If resources are scarce and parameters cannot deviate signiﬁcantly
from their current values, then local metrics imply that Liberia will experience the greatest beneﬁt
from additional resources. This can be seen in many ways, as Liberia possesses the larger current
value of R0, the smaller proportion of hospitalized cases, the greater rate of decrease in R0(ψ), and
the greatest decrease in the infected population as ψ is varied. Contrastingly, if the introduction of
new resources can drastically alter parameters within the model, then the global activity scores are
the pertinent metric, and they indicate that Sierra Leone will derive the greater beneﬁt. In either
case, our methods have clearly demonstrated the importance of the hospitalization rate amongst
all other parameters which appear in the model. Namely, Figures 8 and 9 show that the parameter
ψ has the largest impact on reducing R0 in both Liberia and Sierra Leone. Furthermore, Figure 9
conﬁrms our initial ﬁnding that the parameter ω, as well as β2 and γ1, has very little inﬂuence on
the basic reproduction number R0.

Given the scarce resources available for treatment in Western Africa, the conclusions drawn
herein are further veriﬁed by the state of the Ebola epidemic in Liberia as of April 2015.
In
December of 2014, The People’s Republic of China decided to place new treatment facilities within
Liberia [8], and the result has been a vast improvement in controlling the spread of the infection.
As of April 29, 2015 there had been no new cases in the nation of Liberia for 34 days and many
of the additional Ebola treatment centers within this region are either scheduled to scale-down,
in the process of closing, or have already closed. Furthermore, the Chinese government’s decision
to allocate resources toward the opening of an additional Ebola treatment facility in Liberia lends
credence to our ﬁndings, as the presented model and local metrics were able to arrive at the same
conclusions. Given a current and detailed data set, the tools developed within the current study,
including the modiﬁed SEIR model, the process for parameter estimation, and both local and
global metrics for determining the need for hospital resources, could all be used to identify optimal
resource allocation strategies for any number of future epidemics as well.

Appendix: Steady States and Basic Reproduction Number

To determine any non-zero steady state solutions, the rates of change for the S, E, I, H, and RI
populations were set to zero. As previously described, the equations for the removed-buried and
removed-recovered populations decouple from the model and thus were omitted. With this, we ﬁnd

Notice that within (11), S = 0 is one possible solution, which implies I = 0 and that all populations
are zero. As we assume throughout that the total population satisﬁes N > 0, this steady state is
not possible. Instead, imposing I = 0 within (11), we see that S is arbitrary. However, to satisfy
the total population constraint, we must have S = 1. Hence, we ﬁnd the unique infection-free
steady state ( ¯S, ¯E, ¯I, ¯H, ¯RI ) = (1, 0, 0, 0, 0).

To compute the basic reproduction number of the system with respect to this steady state, we
employ the Next Generation Matrix [12]. In particular, computing the gains and losses matrices
associated with (1), we ﬁnd
