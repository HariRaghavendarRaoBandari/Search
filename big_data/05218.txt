We report on four radio-detected cosmic-ray (CR) or CR-like events observed with the Antarctic Impulsive
Transient Antenna (ANITA), a NASA-sponsored long-duration balloon payload. Two of the four were previ-
ously identiﬁed as stratospheric CR air showers. A third stratospheric CR was detected during the ANITA-II
ﬂight. Here we report on characteristics these three unusual CR events, which develop nearly horizontally, 20-
30 km above the surface of the Earth. In addition, we report on one additional more steeply upward-pointing
CR-like event which has characteristics not easily explained by a CR hypothesis.

We have previously reported the observation of ultra-high
energy (UHE) cosmic ray (CR) air showers detected from sub-
orbital altitudes with the ANITA balloon payload [1] during
our 2007 ﬂight [2]. The initial blind neutrino-search analysis
that led to their identiﬁcation in the data found 16 events in a
signal box with an expected background of 1.6 events. Three
of these 16 events were deemed background: two of unknown
origin, and one a likely thermal noise ﬂuctuation with no ap-
parent signal content. The remaining 13 events were consis-
tent with geomagnetically-induced CR radio pulses seen in
reﬂection off the Antarctic ice surface. Three additional CRs
were also found in cross-correlation analysis after the unblind-
ing, including two events from directions above the geomet-
ric horizon but below the horizontal. These stratospheric air
showers represent a class of CR which has not been previously
observed.

ANITA [3] makes precise horizontal (Hpol) and vertical
(Vpol) polarization measurements of each detected impulse,
using custom dual-polarized quad-ridged horn antennas. For
the CR events, their horizontal planes of polarization corre-
lated closely with Lorentz-force components of the predomi-
nantly vertical Antarctic geomagnetic ﬁeld, once Fresnel coef-
ﬁcients for reﬂection from the ice surface were accounted for.

The above-horizon CR events had opposite polarity compared
to the reﬂected events, consistent with a lack of inversion by
reﬂection, and also had geomagnetically correlated planes of
polarization.
In addition to these two above-horizon events
observed in ANITA-I, an additional event of the same type
was observed in ANITA-II, selected according to its high cor-
relation to CR waveform templates. ANITA-II, which was op-
timized for in-ice neutrino detection, did not have a dedicated
CR trigger but still detected a small number of CR impulses
that had sufﬁcient signal strength.

Motivated by recent results in which searches for upward-
directed or Earth-skimming CR air showers have been used
to constrain the ﬂux of τ lepton decays arising from UHE
ντ [4–6], we have performed more detailed evaluation of the
properties of these apparently up-coming radio-detected CRs.
The three stratospheric events appear consistent with our ex-
pectations for ANITA’s acceptance to the known CR ﬂux at
energies above 1018 eV. In reviewing the other putative back-
ground events that passed our blind analysis cuts, we found
that one of these was dominated by Hpol content, consistent
with the geomagnetic parameters of a CR. It arrived at the
payload from a direction of 27.4◦ below the horizontal, which
was a fairly typical angle for the reﬂected CR events. Yet it

did not appear to correlate well with the reﬂected CR signal
shape, and was thus rejected as background at the time [2]. In
re-evaluating this event, we realized that the polarity and plane
of polarization are consistent with an air shower seen directly,
without the reﬂection phase inversion. However, its steep up-
ward pointing angle poses clear problems for interpretation.
In this report, we analyze characteristics of all four of these
unusual upward-directed events seen by ANITA, with speciﬁc
focus on what relation, if any, the previously excluded event
may have with τ-lepton-initiated air showers.

FIG. 1: Waveforms for the four events described here. Events

are indexed here and in the text by the letters A,B,C,D.

Table I shows characteristics of the three stratospheric
events. Angles of arrival relative to the payload horizon-
tal and their standard errors are determined through pulse-
phase interferometric mapping [7]. Distances to various in-
tegrated atmospheric column depths X, including the approxi-
mate depth of shower maximum Xmax, assuming a shower en-
ergy of ∼ 1018 eV, are given along the track, based on a stan-
dard atmosphere model for Antarctica, and with uncertainties
primarily dominated by the angle-of-arrival uncertainty. The
geodetic positions in each case are given according to the es-

timated location of Xmax.

Figure 1 shows the ﬁeld-strength waveforms for all of the
events, derived from coherent beam-forming [7], with the in-
strumental response then deconvolved. Both Hpol and Vpol
are plotted. The Hpol polarity of each of these events, checked
independently by two quantitative methods, is phase-reversed
with respect to the other 14 UHECR events which were in-
verted by reﬂection from the ice surface [1]. For CRs, Vpol
polarity and magnitude depends on components of the geo-
magnetic ﬁeld in the locale of the event, as we will quantify
later.

These three events at shallow elevation angles, which cor-
relate closely in pulse shape to our other sample of radio-
detected CRs, develop and propagate in the stratosphere, un-
der very rariﬁed densities. Their overall length is greatly mag-
niﬁed compared to showers observed by ground arrays. The
lowest of the three events has a likely ﬁrst interaction point
well beyond the geometric horizon, and will have largely dis-
sipated in the vicinity of the geometric horizon at ∼ 650 km.
The higher two events are at least 200 km, and possibly more
than 600 km in length, in both cases passing by the ANITA
payload before they have dissipated.
In the highest event,
which develops above 30 km, the shower was near its max-
imum development when it passed by ANITA. Geometric es-
timates of ANITA’s expected rate of CRs at these angles, us-
ing the acceptance determined by the reﬂected CRs [8], indi-
cates that the number of detected events is consistent with the
known CR spectrum at EeV energies.

To characterize these events more fully, we estimate their
Stokes parameters. Fig. 2 show I,Q,U,V in a spectro-temporal
decomposition for these three events. In all cases the linear
polarization components associated with Q and U are clearly
evident. In addition, in the two stronger events there is up to
25% Stokes V content, indicating circular polarization (CP)
present in the signal, well above the ≤ 3% residual instru-
mental polarization effects for our data. For all of the events
the total polarized fraction is 100% within statistical errors
due to thermal noise. CP in radio signals from CRs at the few
percent level has been hypothesized to arise from interference
between the primary signal generation from geomagnetic ef-
fects [9, 10], and the secondary signal from the Askaryan ef-
fect [11], but there is no currently accepted model to predict
the resulting CP content for our signals.

dicating both a linear and CP component; the CP fraction is
∼ 10% of the total polarization.

Table II shows parameters for event D under the hypothe-
sis that it is radio emission from a CR air shower, seen either
in reﬂection from the ice surface, or from a direct air shower
starting along the track from the surface to the payload, al-
though for the former case the polarity is inconsistent. For
the latter case, the only Standard Model (SM) physics origin
we know of for up-going air showers is from the interactions
or decay of a secondary lepton from a neutrino interaction;
however, at these angles, the chord distance through the Earth
most likely excludes neutrinos of the energies that ANITA is
likely to detect in such a process.

For a cosmic-ray air shower, the Lorentz force on the rel-
ativistic electron-positron pairs yields a plane of acceleration
in the local shower frame given by sinΨ = ˆv× ˆB, where ˆv is
a unit vector giving the shower direction, and ˆB the geomag-
netic ﬁeld direction. The resulting radiation Poynting vector
can then be extrapolated to the payload location for each event
to determine the predicted ﬁeld-strength ratio for Vpol to
Hpol. Residual non-vertical components of the Antarctic ge-
omagnetic ﬁelds will result in small but correlated Vpol com-
ponents for CR events; anthropogenic or other backgrounds
should have no correlation to geomagnetic reference planes.
Fig. 4 shows results of this analysis for the four events
considered here. The predicted Vpol component in each
case arises from the geomagnetic Lorentz force acting on the
shower charge in the region around the shower maximum

strong Hpol, and a correlated Vpol signal. The primary pulse
correlates well with both the above-horizon signals and the in-
version of the 14 reﬂected CR signals. There is also an excess
of noise evident in the trailing part of the signal, similar to
what is observed in several of the reﬂected CRs [2], although
in this case it appears more persistent and larger in amplitude.
In Fig. 3 we show the spectro-temporal plot of Stokes param-

exceed the magnitude of 3985267’s shape correlation coefﬁ-
cient with the previously identiﬁed CRs. Based on analysis of
the 80,000 anthropogenic background events seen in our blind
analysis, this chance probability is p = 0.022. An alternate
analysis in which we do not presume equal likelihood, but that
events with high relative correlation coefﬁcients to CRs might
preferentially survive in the signal box, gives a correspond-
ing probability of p = 0.10. Now including factors associated
with the polarity correlation (0.5), the geomagnetic correla-
tion (0.07), and using the background estimate of 1.6 events,
the estimated chance probability is 0.0013 ≤ p ≤ 0.0056. An-
thropogenic origin for this event is thus disfavored but not ex-
cluded at high conﬁdence.

In Table III we provide estimates of the energy of each of
the air showers considered here, based on the assumption of
scaling from simulations of down-going CR [8]. For event D
we consider only the upcoming hypothesis. The uncertainties
in each case arise primarily from the lack of precision in the
Xmax location and related systematic effects. More precise es-
timates will require detailed simulations that are beyond our
scope. For event D, a τ decay origin for the shower still leaves
large uncertainty in the location of the decay along the track;
indeed, a τ decay higher than about 6 km above the surface
leads to a shower that can exit the atmosphere before it even
reaches shower maximum.

However, the hypothesis of a τ decay poses difﬁcult prob-
lems of interpretation for the parent ντ. The minimum emer-
gence angle possible given our angular errors and the uncer-
tainty of where we are on the ∼ 1◦ emission cone is 25.4◦,
with a corresponding chord through the Earth of 5460 km,
about 17,000 km water equivalent for standard models of
Earth’s density proﬁle. At 1 EeV, the SM neutrino interaction
length is of order 2000 km water-equivalent, and the implied
attenuation coefﬁcient is ∼ 2× 10−4, effectively excluding a
neutrino origin for this event, even when the effects of ντ re-
generation are considered [12]. Indeed we ﬁnd that, for SM
cross sections, ANITA’s geometric acceptance to this type of
event should lead to more events observed closer to the hori-
zon, which are not seen.

SM uncertainties can in some scenarios lead to suppression
of the ν cross section at these energies [13]. Initial estimates
indicate suppression factors of 3-5 are required to make this
event a plausible ντ candidate. This large a suppression would
require revision of many current UHE neutrino limits (includ-
ing our own).

We note that the ice depth at the location of this event is 3-

Xmax. Errors on the predicted values arise primarily from
the combined uncertainties of the Hpol ﬁeld strength, and the
amplitude calibration between Vpol and Hpol. Measurement
errors are dominated by the thermal noise ﬂoor. The strato-
spheric events are all consistent within errors with geomag-
netic correlation, as is the case for event D, when evaluated
for the geomagnetic parameters of an upward-coming direct
event. If the observed polarity of event D were inverted com-
pared to what was observed, it could be marginally consistent
with a relected CR (at the 2.5σ level). However, the coher-
ently beam-formed signal-to-noise ratio for the ﬁeld strength
of this event is 16 : 1 for Hpol, and 4 : 1 for Vpol, rendering
the statistical chance of a mis-identiﬁcation of polarity com-
pletely negligible; we conclude that a reﬂected-CR hypothe-
sis is excluded for this event. We note also that the measured
Vpol/Hpol ratio of the largest secondary peak in this event,
occuring 4 ns after the primary peak, is consistent geomagnet-
ically with the ﬁrst peak, suggesting a similar physical origin
for these two components.

The original blind analysis that selected the ANITA-I CR
events [1] required only that the events show phase coher-
ence not present in thermal noise ﬂuctuations and that their
reconstructed position be isolated both temporally and spa-
tially from all other events. None of these cuts involved either
shape or polarity analysis, or correlation to geomagnetic pa-
rameters. We estimate the a posteriori probability that event D
would pass the initial blind analysis, and then the further se-
lections given here, as follows. We assume in one case that
all anthropogenic interference events have equal probability
of surviving as impulses isolated from any other events. We
then estimate the number of background events that equal or

rock, increasing the probability of survival to decay above the
ice surface. A τ-lepton may itself initiate an air shower as it
emerges from the ice at these high energies, and its radio emis-
sion would be delayed relative to the higher-altitude shower
produced by the τ-decay. Such a scenario could lead to the
correlated trailing noise observed within ≤ 10 ns of the pri-
mary peak in the waveform of this event, as it is consistent
with atmospheric delay if this portion of the signal originated
near the surface of the ice.

Current or future data may be able to conﬁrm or falsify
whether neutrino interactions are the origin of this event. To
optimize detection for in-ice neutrino events, ANITA-II had
a trigger design with low efﬁciency for CR-like events. For
ANITA-III’s ﬂight completed last year, the trigger for CR
events was reinstated, and data analysis is ongoing. ANITA-
IV is scheduled to ﬂy later this year.
