MINIMAL GRAPHS IN THE HYPERBOLIC SPACE

WITH SINGULAR ASYMPTOTIC BOUNDARIES

QING HAN, WEIMING SHEN, AND YUE WANG

Abstract. We study asymptotic behaviors of solutions f to the Dirichlet problem
for minimal graphs in the hyperbolic space with singular asymptotic boundaries under
the assumption that the boundaries are piecewise regular with positive curvatures. We
derive an estimate of such solutions by the corresponding solutions in the intersections
of interior tangent balls. The positivity of curvatures plays an important role.

Assume that Ω ⊂ Rn is a bounded domain. Lin [11] studied the Dirichlet problem of

the form

f = 0 on ∂Ω,

f > 0 in Ω.

Geometrically, the graph of f is a minimal surface in Hn+1 with its asymptotic boundary
at inﬁnity given by ∂Ω. We note that the equation in (1.1) is a quasilinear non-uniformly
elliptic equation. It becomes singular on ∂Ω since f = 0 there. Lin [11] proved that

(1.1) admits a unique solution f ∈ C( ¯Ω)T C ∞(Ω) if Ω ⊂ Rn is a C 2-domain with
a nonnegative boundary mean curvature H∂Ω ≥ 0 with respect to the inward normal
direction of ∂Ω. Concerning the higher global regularity, Lin proved f ∈ C 1/2( ¯Ω) if
H∂Ω > 0. In [7], we proved that under the condition H∂Ω ≥ 0, f ∈ C

This estimate does not depend on the regularity of the domain, which allows us to discuss
(1.1) in domains with singularity.
In [7], we also proved that (1.1) admits a unique

solution f ∈ C 1/2( ¯Ω)T C ∞(Ω) if Ω is a bounded domain which is the intersection of

ﬁnitely many bounded convex C 2-domains Ωi with H∂Ωi > 0.

Concerning asymptotic behaviors of solutions f of (1.1), we have the following result.

Let Ω be a bounded C 2,α-domain with H∂Ω > 0, for some α ∈ (0, 1). Then,

where d is the distance function to ∂Ω. We need to mention that the estimate (1.2) is
sharp under the present regularity assumption. If ∂Ω has a higher regularity, we can
expand more. For details, refer to [4].

In this paper, we study asymptotic behaviors of solutions f of (1.1) near boundaries

with singularity.

There have been only a few results concerning the boundary behaviors of solutions of
geometric PDEs in singular domains. This is partly due to the diversity of singularity
and complexity of the relevant geometric problems. The ﬁrst two authors studied the
asymptotic behaviors of solutions of the Liouville equation in [5] and solutions of the
Loewner-Nirenberg problem in [6] in singular domains and proved that the solutions are
well approximated by the corresponding solutions in tangent cones at singular points on
the boundary.

Asymptotic behaviors of solutions of (1.1) are more complicated than those of so-
lutions of the Liouville equation and solutions of the Loewner-Nirenberg problem. As
the estimate (1.2) illustrates, the positivity of the boundary mean curvature plays an
important role in the estimates of solutions near C 2,α-boundary. When we attempt to
generalize (1.2) to domains with singularity, we cannot compare solutions f of (1.1)
with the corresponding solutions in tangent cones if the tangent cones have zero mean
curvature wherever they are smooth. This is the case if the tangent cones are bounded
by ﬁnitely many hyperplanes. We need a “model” domain to preserve the positivity of
the boundary mean curvature. Such a model domain is provided by the intersection of
tangent balls at the singular points.

We prove the following result for n = 2.

Theorem 1.1. Let Ω be a bounded convex domain in R2 and, for 0 ∈ ∂Ω and some
R > 0, let ∂Ω ∩ BR consist of two C 2,α-curves σ1 and σ2 intersecting at the origin with
an angle µπ, for some constants α, µ ∈ (0, 1), such that σi has a positive curvature κi at
the origin, for i = 1, 2. Suppose f ∈ C( ¯Ω) ∩ C ∞(Ω) is the solution of (1.1) and h is the
corresponding solution in

r and a C 2,α-diﬀeomorphism T : Br → T (Br) ⊆ R2, with T (ΩT Br) = Ωµ,κ1,κ2T T (Br)
and T (∂ΩT Br) = ∂Ωµ,κ1,κ2T T (Br), such that, for any x ∈ Br,

where β is a constant in (0, α/2] and C is a positive constant depending only on R, α,
µ, and the C 2,α-norms of σ1 and σ2 in BR.

In the proof of Theorem 1.1, we will construct the map T , which is determined by the
distances to σi. We note that (1.3) generalizes (1.2) to singular boundaries. We point
out that if α is suﬃciently small, we can take β = α/2, which is optimal.

We now describe brieﬂy the proof of Theorem 1.1 is based on a combination of iso-
metric transforms and the maximum principle. Usually, when we discuss asymptotic
behaviors of solutions f in the domain Ω with a singularity at x0, we compare such so-
lutions with the corresponding solutions in tangent cones at x0. However, the positivity
of curvatures is not preserved for tangent cones. Instead, we use the solution fµ,κ1,κ2 in
Ωµ,κ1,κ2 deﬁned as intersections of tangent balls as stated in Theorem 1.1. Our goal is
to compare the solution f in Ω near x0 with the solution fµ,κ1,κ2 in Ωµ,κ1,κ2. We note
that a given point x in Ω may not necessarily be a point in Ωµ,κ1,κ2. So as a part of the
comparison of f with uVx0
, we need to construct a map T , which maps Ω near x0 onto
fµ,κ1,κ2 near x0, and to compare f (x) with fµ,κ1,κ2(T x). We achieve this in two steps.

the larger balls.

In the second step, we compare the solution f in Ω near x0 with the solution fµ,κ1,κ2

In the ﬁrst step, we construct two sets eB and bB with the property eB ⊆ Ω ⊆ bB near x.
To construct such sets eB and bB, we ﬁrst place two balls tangent to σi at pi, the closest
point to x on σi, for each i = 1, 2. We can form eB from the smaller balls and bB from
in Ωµ,κ1,κ2. To this end, we ﬁrst compare f with the solutions ef and bf in eB and
bB, respectively, and then compare ef and bf with fµ,κ1,κ2. We note that the sets eB,
bB, and Ωµ,κ1,κ2 have the same structure; namely, they are the intersections of two balls.

Comparisons of solutions in these sets are aided by isometric transforms in the hyperbolic
space.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we prove the existence of solutions of
(1.1) in inﬁnite cones and prove some basic estimates for these solutions. In Section 3,
we prove that asymptotic expansions near singular boundary points up to certain orders
are local properties.
In Section 4, we study the asymptotic expansions near singular
points with positive curvatures and prove Theorem 1.1.

2. Solutions in Cones

In this section, we discuss (1.1) in inﬁnite cones and prove the existence and uniqueness
of its solutions. We also derive some basic estimates. Throughout this section, we assume
n = 2.

For some constant µ < 1, deﬁne

Vµ = {(r, θ) | r ∈ (0,∞), θ ∈ (0, µπ)}.

This is an inﬁnite cone in R2, expressed in polar coordinates. Our goal is to ﬁnd a
solution f of (1.1) in the form

f = rh(θ)

in Ω = Vµ.

a composition of the following transformations.

First, consider

Now we proceed to prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions of (1.1) in cones.

QING HAN, WEIMING SHEN, AND YUE WANG

Theorem 2.3. Let Vµ the the cone as in (2.1), for some µ ∈ (0, 1). Then, there exists
a unique solution f of (1.1) for Ω = Vµ. Moreover, f has the form rh(θ).

Proof. We ﬁrst prove the existence. For any R > 0, set

Vµ,R = {(r, θ)| r ∈ (0, R), θ ∈ (0, µπ)}.

By Theorem 3.1 [7], there exists a unique solution fµ,R of (1.1) for Ω = Vµ,R and, by the
maximum principle and Lemma 2.1,

(2.11)

fµ,R ≤ Cα,µr(cid:18)sin

1+α

in Vµ,R.

By the maximum principle again, we have, for any positive R1 and R2 with R1 < R2,

(2.12)

fµ,R1 ≤ fµ,R2

in Vµ,R1.

Next, the uniqueness and scaling imply

For any positive δ suﬃciently small, set

k(cid:17) .
fµ,k(x) = kfµ,1(cid:16) x

Wµ,δ = {(r, θ) ∈ Vµ|r ∈ (0,∞), θ ∈ (δπ, (µ − δ)π)}.

Then for any x ∈ Wµ,δ, we have

d ≥ (sin δπ)r.

By employing the method in the proof of Theorem 3.2 in [7], we can prove, for any
x ∈ Wµ,δ and any k ≥ 2[|x| + 1],
(2.13)

|∇fµ,k| ≤ C(µ, δ, x).

In fact, for any k ≥ 2[|x| + 1], Bdx/4(x) ⊆ Vµ,k. By Step 1 in the proof of Theorem 3.2
in [7], we have

(2.14)

k∇fµ,kkLp(Bdx/4(x)) ≤ C(p, µ, δ)d

n
p .

Note that fµ,k ≥ fµ,2[|x|+1] for any k ≥ 2[|x| + 1], by (2.12). By combining with (2.14)
and proceeding as in Step 2 in the proof of Theorem 3.2 in [7], we can get (2.13) by
applying the W 2,p-estimate. Now for any x ∈ Vµ, there exists a positive small δ such
that x ∈ Wµ,δ. Then for any y ∈ Bdx/4(x) and large enough positive k, we have

|fµ,k(x) − fµ,k(y)| ≤ C(µ, δ, x)|x − y|.

Therefore, by (2.12) and the interior estimate, for any x ∈ Vµ, we have that fµ,R(x)
converges to some fµ(x) as R → ∞ and fµ ∈ C ∞(Vµ) is a solution of
(2.15)

By (2.11), fµ is continuous up to the boundary of Vµ and fµ = 0 on ∂Vµ. In summary, fµ
is a solution of (1.1) for Ω = Vµ. Moreover, for any positive integer k, fµ,kR(x) converges
to fµ(x) as R goes to inﬁnity. By the property

Let f1 and f2 be two solutions of (1.1) for Ω = Vµ. By Remark 2.3 [11], {(x, f1(x))}
and {(x, f2(x))} are two absolutely area-minimizing hypersurfaces with the asymptotic
boundary ∂Vµ. Let T1 be the map deﬁned in (2.10) with L = 1. Then, T −1

and maps the absolutely area-minimizing hypersurface {(x, fi(x))} with the asymptotic

boundary ∂Vµ to the absolutely area-minimizing hypersurface {(y,efi(y))} with the as-
ymptotic boundary ∂eΩ, i = 1, 2. By Corollary 2.4 [11], ef1 = ef2. Hence, f1 = f2.

Next, we proceed as Lin [11]. Let f be a solution of (1.1) in Ω. Locally near each
boundary point, the graph of f can be represented by a function over its vertical tangent
plane. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁx a boundary point of Ω, say the origin, and assume that the
vector en = (0,··· , 0, 1) is the interior normal vector to ∂Ω at the origin. Then, with
x = (x′, xn), the x′-hyperplane is the tangent plane of ∂Ω at the origin and the boundary
∂Ω can be expressed in a neighborhood of the origin as a graph of a smooth function
over Rn−1 × {0}, say

(cid:3)

xn = ϕ(x′).

We now denote points in Rn+1 = Rn × R by (x′, xn, t). The vertical hyperplane given by
xn = 0 is the tangent plane to the graph of f at the origin in Rn+1. We can represent
the graph of f as a graph of a new function u deﬁned in terms of (x′, 0, t) for small x′
and t, with t > 0. In other words, we treat Rn = Rn−1 × {0} × R as our new base space
and write u = u(x′, t). Then, for some R > 0, u satisﬁes

Lemma 2.4 follows from Theorem 1.1 [4] by taking ℓ = k = n + 1. In fact, c2,··· , cn
and cn+1,1 are coeﬃcients for local terms and have explicit expressions in terms of ϕ.
Meanwhile, cn+1 is the coeﬃcient of the ﬁrst nonlocal term.
Corollary 2.5. Let Vµ be the cone as in (2.1), for some µ ∈ (0, 1), and let f = rh(θ)
be the solution of (1.1) for Ω = Vµ as in Theorem 2.3. Then,

and

Proof. Take n = 2 and consider (2.21) at (r, θ) = (1, 0) ∈ ∂Vµ. Then, c2 = 0, c3,1 = 0,
and, by renaming the coeﬃcient for t3,

u = aµt3 + O(t4),

where aµ is a constant and

We write the coeﬃcient of t3 as aµ to emphasize its dependence on µ.

In Theorem 2.3, we proved the existence of solutions of (2.2) in Vµ and obtained the
unique solutions of the form f = rhµ(θ). Here, hµ(θ) is a function of θ on (0, µπ) and we
adopt the subscript µ to indicate that hµ.

We now compare hµ for diﬀerent µ.

Lemma 2.6. Let µ1 and µ2 be two distinct constants in (0, 1) and hµi(θ) be the solution
of (2.2) on (0, µiπ), for i = 1, 2. Then, for µ1 < µ2 < µ1 + δ(µ1),

We now compare aµ in (2.22) for diﬀerent µ.

Lemma 2.7. Let µ1 and µ2 be two distinct constants in (0, 1) and aµi be deﬁned as in

3. Local Asymptotic Expansions

In this section, we prove that asymptotic expansions near singular boundary points

up to certain orders are local properties.
Lemma 3.1. Let Ω and Ω∗ be two convex domains in R2 such that, for some x0 ∈ ∂Ω
and some R0 > 0,

Ω\ BR0(x0) = Ω∗\ BR0(x0),

and that ∂Ω∩BR0(x0) consists of two C 1,1-curves σ1, σ2 intersecting at x0 with the angle
between the tangent lines of σ1 and σ2 given by µπ, for some µ ∈ (0, 1). Suppose that f
and f∗ are solutions of (1.1) for Ω and Ω∗, respectively. Then, for some τ ∈ (0, 1),
(3.1)

|f (x) − f∗(x)| ≤ Cf (x)(cid:18)|x − x0|
r0 (cid:19)τ

for any x ∈ Ω ∩ Br0(x0),

where r0 and C are positive constants depending only on R, µ and the C 1,1-norms of σ1
and σ2 in BR0(x0).
Proof. Set νi to be the unit inner normal vector to σi at x0, for i = 1, 2. Note Ω ⊆ Vx0
since Ω is convex. By the maximum principle, we have, for any x ∈ Ω,
(3.2)

f (x) ≤ fµ(x) = |x − x0|hµ(θ),

where fµ is the solution of (1.1) for Ω = Vx0. We consider two cases.

Case 1. We ﬁrst prove (3.1) in the region {d ≥ |x − x0|
Since both σ1 and σ2 are C 1,1, there exists a positive constant R, depending only on

2}.
R0, µ, and the C 1,1-norms of σ1 and σ2 in BR0(x0), such that

eΩ ≡ BR(x0 + Rν1)\ BR(x0 + Rν2) ⊆ Ω.
Let ef be the solution of (1.1) for eΩ. The maximum principle implies
We note that the tangent cone of Ω at x0 is also the tangent cone of eΩ at a0. It is easy

to see that ∂BR(x0 + Rν1) and ∂BR(x0 + Rν2) intersect at two points, one of which is
x0 and another denoted by q. A simple calculation yields

f ≥ ef

Set L = R sin µπ

We consider the map TL introduced in (2.10). Then, TL maps the minimal surface

{(x,ef (x))} in H3 to the minimal surface {(y,efµ(y))} in H3 and maps conformally Ω0 to
an inﬁnite cone eV , which conjugates Vx0. Note
eV = Vx0 +

We now consider terms in II. For illustrations, we consider the following three terms:

For II1, we write

By (3.12), we have

II1 = −2Cα|x|α−2f 2h2h0[(x · ∇f )∆f − xifjfij],
II2 = −Cα(n − 1)|x|α−2f 2h2h0|∇f|2,

4. Singular Points with Positive Curvatures

Let Ω be a bounded convex domain in R2 and, for some x0 ∈ ∂Ω and R > 0, let
∂Ω ∩ BR(x0) consist of two C 2,α-curves σ1 and σ2 intersecting at the origin at an angle
µπ, for some constants α, µ ∈ (0, 1). Assume the curvature κi of σi at x0 is positive and
denote by Ri = 1/κi. Set

Ωx0,µ,κ1,κ2 = BR1(x0 + R1ν1)\ BR2(x0 + R2ν2),

where νi is the unit inner normal vector of σi at x0. Then, any x ∈ Ωx0,µ,κ1,κ2 near x0 is
uniquely determined by d1, d2, where di(x) is the distance from x to ∂BRi(Riνi). With
such a one-to-one correspondence between x ∈ Ωx0,µ,κ1,κ2 near 0 and (d1, d2) with d1 > 0
and d2 > 0 small, we rewrite the solution of (1.1) for Ω = Ωx0,µ,κ1,κ2 as

(4.1)

fx0,µ,R1,R2(d1, d2).

We prove the following result in this section.

Theorem 4.1. Let Ω be a bounded convex domain in R2 and, for some x0 ∈ ∂Ω and
R > 0, let ∂Ω ∩ BR consist of two C 2,α-curves σ1 and σ2 intersecting at x0 at an angle
µπ, for some constants α, µ ∈ (0, 1). Assume the curvature κi of σi at x0 is positive.
Suppose f ∈ C( ¯Ω) ∩ C ∞(Ω) is the solution of (1.1) in Ω. Then, for any x ∈ Ω close to
x0,

(4.2)

|f (x) − fx0,µ,R1,R2(d1, d2)| ≤ Cf (x)|x − x0|β,

where di is the distance to σi, fx0,µ,R1,R2 is the solution of (1.1) in Ωx0,µ,κ1,κ2 in terms
of d1 and d2, β is a constant in (0, α/2], and C is a positive constant depending only on
R, µ, α, and the C 2,α-norms of σ1 and σ2 in BR(x0).
Proof. Without loss of generality, we assume d1 ≤ d2. Then,

d2 ≤ |x − x0| ≤ Cd2.

We consider two cases.

Case 1. We ﬁrst consider the case d1 ≥ |x − x0|

3.1, speciﬁcally (3.5), we have

3

2 . By Case 1 in the proof of Lemma

(4.3)

f (x) = fµ(x)(1 + O(|x − x0|

1

2 )),

where fµ(x) is the corresponding solution of (1.1) on the tangent cone Vx0 of Ω at x0.
Let x∗ be the unique point in Ωx0,µ,κ1,κ2 determined by d1, d2. Then,

|x∗ − x| ≤ C|x − x0|2+α.

Note that Vx0 is also the tangent cone of Ωx0,µ,κ1,κ2 at x0. Hence,

fx0,µ,R1,R2(d1, d2) = fµ(x∗)(1 + O(|x∗ − x0|

1

2 )).

By the mean value theorem and θ ≥ |x − x0|

1

2 , we get

|fµ(x) − fµ(x∗)| ≤ C|x − x0|− 1

3|x − x0|2+α ≤ Cfµ(x)|x − x0|

Therefore,

Case 2. We consider d1 ≤ |x − x0|

We note that ∂BR1(x0 +R1ν1) and ∂BR2(x0 +R2ν2) intersect at two points, one of which
is x0 and another denoted by q. By Lemma 6.1 in [6] or calculating directly, we have

(x0 + bRiνpi) is di for i = 1, 2. Hence,
bf (x) = fx0,bµ, bR1, bR2
ef (x) = fx0,µ,R1,R2(d1, d2)(1 + O(|x − x0|γ)),
bf (x) = fx0,µ,R1,R2(d1, d2)(1 + O(|x − x0|γ)).
Set eL = |epeq|/2. By a translation and a rotation, we assume
Then, T eL|{x3=0} transforms eΩ conformally to an inﬁnite cone Veµ and T eL transforms the
minimal graph {(ex1,ef (ex))} with the asymptotic boundary ∂eΩ to the minimal graph
{(ey, feµ(ey))} with the asymptotic boundary ∂Veµ. With x = (x1, x2), set y = (y1, y2) such
that (y, feµ(y)) = T eL(x,ef (x)). For brevity, set
ef (x) ≤ C|x − x0| |x − x0|
|x − x0| ! 1

We have the desired result by combining (4.4), (4.6), and (4.7).

(cid:3)

We are ready to prove Theorem 1.1.

Proof of Theorem 1.1. We adopt the notations from Theorem 4.1 and its proof. Without
loss of generality, we assume x0 is the origin. For any x suﬃciently small, we deﬁne

T{σi}x = (d1(x), d2(x)),

where di(x) is the signed distance from x to σi with respect to νi, i = 1, 2, positive if x is
on the side of νi and negative if on another side. Refer to [6] for details. We emphasize
that T{σi} is deﬁned in a full neighborhood of the origin instead of only in Ω and that the
signed distance is used instead of its absolute value. Then, T{σi} is C 2,α near the origin
and its Jacobi matrix at the origin is nonsingular by the linear independence of ν1 and
ν2. Therefore, T{σi} is a C 2,α-diﬀeormorphism in a neighborhood of the origin. We have
a similar result for T{∂BRi (Riνi)}, with ∂BRi(Riνi) replacing σi, i = 1, 2. Then, the map
T = T −1
{∂BRi (Riνi)} ◦ T{σi} is a C 2,α-diﬀeomorphism near the origin and has the property
that the signed distance from x to σi is the same as that from T x to ∂BRi(Riνi), for
i = 1, 2. Therefore, Theorem 1.1 follows from Theorem 4.1.
