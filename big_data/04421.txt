ABSTRACT

A radio source that faded over 6 days, with a redshift z ≈ 0.5 host, has been identiﬁed by Keane
et al. (2016) as the transient afterglow to a Fast Radio Burst (FRB 150418). We report follow-
up radio and optical observations of the afterglow candidate, and ﬁnd a source that is consistent
with an active galactic nucleus (AGN). If the afterglow-candidate is nonetheless a prototypical FRB
afterglow, existing surveys limit the fraction of FRBs that produce afterglows to 0.25 for modulation-
index m = ∆S/ ¯S ≥ 0.7, and 0.07 for m ≥ 1, at 95% conﬁdence. Afterglow associations with the
barrage of bursts expected from future FRB surveys must satisfy constraints on the afterglow rate set
by state of the art slow-transient surveys.

INTRODUCTION

Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration,
intense (∼ 1 Jy) GHz transients that have dispersion
measures well in excess of expected Milky Way contribu-
tions (Lorimer et al. 2007; Thornton et al. 2013; Spitler
et al. 2014; Burke-Spolaor & Bannister 2014; Ravi et al.
2015; Petroﬀ et al. 2015; Masui et al. 2015; Keane et
al. 2016). Extragalactic FRBs would represent a truly
extraordinary class of radio emitter, likely corresponding
to exotic, cataclysmic events (for e.g., Kashiyama et al.
2013; Lyubarsky 2014; Kulkarni et al. 2014; Cordes &
Wasserman 2016).
If FRBs originate at cosmological
distances, studies of FRB samples will revolutionize
our understanding of the intergalactic medium (e.g.,
McQuinn 2014; Zheng et al. 2014).

Localization of an FRB to a host galaxy will not
only determine the distance-scale of FRBs, but will also
provide vital clues to evidence their origin, and realize
the anticipated diagnostic of the IGM. Keane et al.
(2016, hereafter K16) promptly followed up a Parkes
event, FRB 150418. The ﬁeld was imaged using the
Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) in the
4.5–8.5 GHz band. The ﬁrst observations began 2 hr
post-burst. The subsequent four epochs were at 5.8 d,
7.8 d, 56 d, and 190 d post-burst. Two variable sources
were identiﬁed: a potential Gigahertz-Peaked Spectrum
(GPS) source, and one that faded by a factor of ∼2.5 by
the third epoch (7.8 d).2

The latter source, identiﬁed with a redshift z ≈ 0.5
galaxy, was interpreted by K16 to be the transient after-
glow of FRB 150418. To clearly distinguish this event
from hypothetical FRB afterglows, we will refer to it as
K16ﬂare. K16 used previous surveys for week-timescale
variables and transients (e.g., Bell et al. 2015; Mooley

2 The ﬂux densities reported by K16 at the ﬁve epochs are 270±

50, 230 ± 20, 90 ± 20, 110 ± 20 and 90 ± 20 µJy respectively.

et al. 2016) to determine a false alarm probability of
< 0.1% of observing K16ﬂare in their observations.
K16 interpreted the light-curve of K16ﬂare as being
consistent with the radio emission sometimes observed
following a short gamma-ray burst (Fong et al. 2015).

The association between FRB 150418 and K16ﬂare,
if true, would be a spectacular conﬁrmation of the
cosmological nature of FRBs, enabling their application
to intergalactic-medium studies. However, even before
the publication ink was dry, Williams & Berger (2016)
reported persistent radio emission from the host galaxy
of K16ﬂare 11 months after the FRB, brighter than the
ﬁnal K16 measurement, and thus suggested that it was
an example of common variability in Active Galactic
Nuclei (AGN) and unrelated to the FRB. Given the
potential importance of K16’s discovery, we consider the
matter worthy of closer investigation.

The paper is organized as follows. In §2, we present
follow-up observations of the candidate FRB host galaxy
with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA), and
the W. M. Keck Observatory. In §3 we explore the hy-
pothesis that K16ﬂare is an AGN unrelated to the FRB.
In §4, we explore the consequences of the K16ﬂare-FRB
association asserted by K16. We present the implications
of our study to future FRB afterglow searches in §5, and
conclude with a summary in §6.

2. RADIO & OPTICAL OBSERVATIONS

On 2016 March 04 (MJD 57451) we undertook
observations over the frequency range 1–18 GHz of
K16ﬂare with the JVLA (DDT program 16A-432).
Our observations were conducted during a single 3.5 hr
block. The JVLA was in the C conﬁguration. We used
standard wide-band continuum observing set-ups and
3C 147 to place our observations on the Perley-Butler
ﬂux-density scale (Perley & Butler 2013). The data
were processed in CASA 4.5.2 with the standard

line shows a best-ﬁt power law spectrum to our data: Sν = (100 ± 5) [ν/10 GHz]α with α = 0.13 ± 0.10. We also show C-band (5 GHz)
ﬂux density measurements obtained by K16 between MJD 57130 and 57138 (red open circles) and by Williams et al. (2016) on MJD 57445

In the L-band (1.4 GHz) the image
rms was 50 µJy whereas it ranged from 4 to 10 µJy
across the S−Ku (2 GHz-18 GHz) band. We detected
a point-like source across the entire decimetric band
(Figure 1). The best-ﬁt (Ku-band) position (J2000) is
07h16m34.5592(6)s, −19◦00m39.73(1)s (1σ errors in the
ﬁnal signiﬁcant ﬁgures in parentheses).

between the two runs is m = 0.5 ± 0.1. For comparison,
the maximum two-epoch modulation index of K16ﬂare
in the K16 observations was m = 1.0 ± 0.3. Variability
of m (cid:46) 1 has been seen in other AGN (Mooley et al.
2016).

Separately, on MJD 57453, we observed the putative
host galaxy (WISE J071634.59−190039.2) with the Low
Resolution Imaging Spectrograph (LRIS Oke et al. 1995)
mounted on the Keck I telescope. We obtained three ex-
posures in the g and R optical bands with Keck-1/LRIS
in imaging mode, totaling 610 s on MJD 57453. Ob-
serving conditions were good, with 0.75(cid:48)(cid:48) R-band seeing.
The data were initially processed using D. Perley’s lpipe
software.4 Using an initial 10 s exposure, we obtained
an initial astrometric solution from the USNO-B2 cata-
log using D. Perley’s autoastrometry.py software, and
reﬁned the astrometry using stars with Ks magnitudes
between 10−14 from the 2MASS Point Source Catalog
(PSC; Skrutskie et al. 2006). The PSC astrometric ac-
curacy is 70–80 mas: we assume a 0.1(cid:48)(cid:48) (1σ) astrometric
accuracy to account for possible minor distortion in the
image. We then corrected the astrometry of our two 300-
s exposures using the shallow exposure, and co-added the
images. We obtained a deep Ks-band image of the ﬁeld
observed by M. Kasliwal (and presented in K16). An
overlay of the radio position on the ﬁnal R-band and
K-band images is shown in Figure 2.

3. K16FLARE AS A VARIABLE AGN

Williams & Berger (2016) note that the radio lumi-
nosity measured by K16, and the near-infrared colors
of the host galaxy WISE J071634.59−190039.2, are
consistent with that of a low-luminosity AGN. We note
that the radio source continues to vary even a year after
the FRB. Williams et al. (2016) reported a ﬂux-density
of 157 ± 6µJy (5 GHz band; 2016 Feb 27/28). Our
observations taken only six days later ﬁnd the source
to have decayed to 96±8 µJy. The modulation index5

It is not uncommon for elliptical galaxies without any
indication of an optical signature of nuclear activity to
harbor a nuclear black hole, with low accretion rate,
accompanied by low radio luminosity (e.g., Hodge et al.
2008). Variable radio emission in the (cid:38) 5 GHz band is
attributed to emission regions at milli-arcsecond scales,
and physically to relativistic shocks of compact jets
(Bignall et al. 2015). Indeed, it was keeping this issue
in mind that we designed our JVLA observations. The
spectrum seen in Figure 1 is ﬂat across this entire band
(1–18 GHz) and consistent with that seen in several
known AGN samples (Herbig & Readhead 1992; Kovalev
et al. 2002). A ﬂat spectrum is a key signature of an
AGN core. The bumps are suggestive of multiple,

should have seen eight afterglows; they found just one.
Even with the conservative all-sky FRB rate of Keane &
Petroﬀ (2015), the discrepancy between the expectation
and observations is large.

In Figure 3 we display the posterior probability density
functions of the areal density of radio sources which vary
on timescales of a week. The black vertical line shows
the expected areal density of FRB afterglows assuming
that all FRBs generate 6-day afterglows similar to
K16ﬂare. Even if FRBs are the only channel to create
6-day afterglows, the slow-transient surveys limit the
fraction of FRBs that produce (S ≥ 270 µJy) afterglows
to < 0.25, for m ≥ 0.7, and < 0.07 for m ≥ 1.0 with
95% conﬁdence. Therefore, if FRBs produce afterglows,
based on measured average slow-transient rate, K16 had
a (cid:46) 10% chance of seeing an afterglow to FRB 150418.

Furthermore, as can be seen from Figure 2 the radio
source coincides with the light centroid of the putative
host galaxy to within experimental errors, (cid:46) 0.1(cid:48)(cid:48).

The simplest hypothesis explaining (i) the persistence
of a ≈ 100 µJy ﬂat-spectrum source nearly a year af-
ter the K16 observation of K16ﬂare, (ii) its continued
variability on 6-day timescales, and (iii) the nuclear ori-
gin, is that WISE J071634.59−190039.2 hosts a nuclear
black hole accreting at a low rate. This hypothesis im-
plies that K16ﬂare was an example of AGN variability
and unrelated to the FRB. Despite this apparently com-
pelling conclusion, in the next section we explore obser-
vational constraints on possible radio afterglow emission
from FRBs from existing radio surveys for transients and
variables.

insight, we as-
In the absence of any additional
sume that K16ﬂare is a prototypical FRB afterglow
(S ≈ 270 µJy at 5.5 GHz, spectral
index of −0.7 at
maximum). We use the VLA radio variability surveys
of Mooley et al. (2016, hereafter M16) and Frail et al.
(2012, hereafter F12) to search for FRB afterglows. De-
tails of these two surveys can be found in the Appendix.
−1
We adopt a conservative all-sky FRB rate of 2500 day
for ﬂuence F > 2 Jy ms (Keane & Petroﬀ 2015).

Since each FRB afterglow lasts 6 days,

the ex-
pected slow-transient rate from FRB afterglows is
0.364 deg−2 epoch−1.
In the framework adopted for
this section, namely all FRBs have radio afterglows
similar to K16ﬂare, the 50-square degree 3-epoch 3-GHz
survey of M16 should have yielded about ﬁfty ﬁve
afterglows. They found none with m ≥ 1, and ﬁve with
m ≥ 0.7. Next consider the the 944-epoch, 0.0225 deg2
slow-transient 5-GHz survey analyzed by F12. F12

SEARCHES

Our experience with FRB 150418 (K16ﬂare) has
informed us of the potential pitfalls in associating FRBs
with afterglows. The areal density of 6-day FRB after-
glows at any given epoch ranges from 0 (FRBs are not
−2 (all FRBs are
associated with afterglows) to 0.37 deg
associated with afterglows). Depending on the fraction
f of FRB associated with afterglows, FRB-afterglows
can therefore form an insigniﬁcant part of the transient
sky, or completely dominate it. New surveys such as the
VLA Sky Survey (Myers et al. 2014) will systematically
explore the sub-mJy transient sky in the decimetric
band, better measuring the event background against
which FRBs afterglows will be searched for.

Machines of the future such as CHIME (Bandura et
al. 2014) and UTMOST (Caleb et al. 2016) are expected
to discover a barrage of FRBs ((cid:38) 1 day−1). Large FRB
samples, combined with follow-up observations for which

the background event rate is well known, will enable a
direct measurement of the fraction f of FRBs that are
associated with transient afterglows.
If the transient
background rate is λbg deg−2, and FRBs are localized
to Ω deg2, the detection of m afterglow candidates in
N follow-ups will yield the estimate f = m/N − λbgΩ.
≈ √
Based on Poisson statistics, the 1σ error in f will be
m/N for large m. Detection of m=100 transients in
follow-ups for instance, will constrain f with about 10%
fractional error (1σ).

While a statistical argument for FRB-afterglow asso-
ciation based on a large number of FRB follow-ups will
be compelling,
localization of an FRB itself at a few
arcsecond-level would imply an (almost) absolute conﬁr-
mation of the host galaxy. To this end, we have proposed
and intend to build a (cid:38) 10-element small dish array at
the Owens valley radio observatory to both detect the
brightest FRBs and provide a localization accuracy ade-
quate for secure identiﬁcation of host galaxies.

6. SUMMARY

We conducted radio and optical follow-up observations
of the afterglow candidate to FRB 150418 (K16ﬂare). We
detected persistent radio emission from the host galaxy
of K16ﬂare ∼ 1 year after the FRB, which is nuclear
in origin (0.1(cid:48)(cid:48) astrometric precision), and has a ﬂat ra-
dio spectrum (1–18 GHz). It is consistent with an AGN
core, and does not present prima facie evidence of being
associated with FRB 150418.

If K16ﬂare is nonetheless a prototypical FRB after-
glow, existing slow radio transient surveys limit the frac-
tion of FRBs that produce afterglows to < 0.25 for mod-
ulation indices (m = ∆S/ ¯S) of m ≥ 0.7, and < 0.07 for
m ≥ 1.0 (95% conﬁdence). The high areal density of
FRBs must be accounted for in computing the statistical
evidence for FRB-afterglow associations. Inferences on
the fraction of FRBs that are associated with afterglows,
of any kind, must be consistent with the rates of such
events measured by state of the art blind surveys.

A1: LIMITS FROM SLOW-TRANSIENT SURVEYS

APPENDIX

Afterglows probably emanate from expanding relativistic plasma where synchrotron self-absorption may be
important. For this reason, apart from the M16 survey (2–4 GHz) which K16 consider in their false-positive rate
calculation, we also consider limits on the transient areal density at 5 GHz by Frail et al. (2012, hereafter F12). F12’s
survey is at a similar frequency as the K16 afterglow, and has undergone rigorous tests to rule out false-candidates
due to imaging and interference-related artifacts6

The relevant survey parameters and ﬁndings are summarized in Table 1. M16 report a 3-epoch 50 deg2 survey, and
classify variables by their m-values: m = 2|S1 − S2|/(S1 + S2); S1 and S2 are ﬂux-densities between epochs. The
m-value for the K16 afterglow is m = 1 ± 0.3. The M16 survey has a completeness limit of S = 500 µJy at 3 GHz, or
327 µJy at 5.5 GHz assuming the same spectral index as the K16 afterglow. M16 found no transients, no variables
with m ≥ 1, and 5 variables with m ≥ 0.7. M16 list a total of 10 variables (their Table 3) with m ≥ 0.7, but half
of them are grossly inconsistent with the K16 afterglow; their ﬂux density drops and rises again on a 1 month timescale.

The F12 survey had a completeness limit of S = 300 µJy at 5 GHz (280 µJy at 5.5 GHz), and found just 1 transient;
RT 19970528 was seen in their single-epoch search and faded from 1731± 232 µJy to < 37 µJy within 7 days. As such,
it is similar to the K16 afterglow in its duration, but signiﬁcantly brighter.

To compare the survey limits and the K16 afterglow on equal footing, we have: (i) computed a ‘5.5 GHz equivalent’
completeness limit assuming a spectral index of −0.7, (ii) obtained the 95% conﬁdence limits on the Poisson parameter λ
in units of (4π sr)−1, and ﬁnally (iii) scaled the limits to a completeness ﬂux-density of 270 µJy by assuming a uniformly
distributed population in Euclidean space. The ﬁnal limits on λ are presented in the last column of Table 1 and in
Figure 3. These limits on the slow-transient areal density are valid for any afterglow, FRB-related or otherwise.

A2: AFTERGLOW RATE CALCULATION

Let Na be the number of FRBs expected within the slow-transient survey area per day. Let each FRB afterglow
last τa days. According to K16, τa ≈ 6 days. Let the slow-transient survey cadence be τs days. The total numbers

returns the smallest argument.
Since for both the M16 and F12 surveys τs > τa, the expected all-sky FRB afterglow rate is Neτa× (FRB all-sky
rate). If all FRBs produce an afterglow similar to the one reported by K16, then for an FRB rate of 2500 sky−1 day−1,
the expected number of detectable afterglows in the M16 and F12 surveys are 55 and 8 respectively.
