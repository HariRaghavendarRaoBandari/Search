Abstract

In this work, we ﬁnd an analytical ﬂat-membrane solution to the saddle point equations, derived

by Guinea et al. [Phys. Rev. B 89, 125428 (2014)], for the case of a suspended graphene membrane

of circular shape. We also ﬁnd how diﬀerent buckled membrane solutions bifurcate from the

ﬂat membrane at critical temperatures and membrane radii. The saddle point equations take

into account electron-phonon coupling and this coupling provides a residual stress even for a ﬂat

graphene layer. Below a critical temperature (which is exceedingly high for an inﬁnite layer) or

above a critical size that depend on boundary conditions, diﬀerent buckling modes that may be the

germ of rippling appear. Our results provide the opportunity to develop new feasible experiments

dealing with buckling in small suspended graphene membranes that could verify them. These

experiments may also be used to ﬁt the phonon-electron coupling constant or the bending energy.

INTRODUCTION

The discovery of graphene has spawned one of the most fertile scientiﬁc ﬁelds of today.

Its unique electrical [1] and mechanical properties [2] promise to revolutionize current tech-

nology, making extremely important to characterize the properties of graphene in order to

design and optimize new devices. Among mechanical properties, the presence of ripples

in suspended graphene [3] has aroused a great theoretical eﬀort focused on their explana-

tion from ﬁrst principles [4–10], and by using simple statistical mechanics models [11–15].

Thermal and external stresses have been used to create large ripples (wrinkles) in a layer

of graphene which is suspended over trenches [16]. These ripples have been explained using

classical elasticity [16] and seem to be qualitatively diﬀerent from the nanometer sized ripples

observed in [3, 17, 18]. The latter tend to be considered inherent to suspended graphene.

Even when ripples in graphene are not fully understood, one of the most promising ap-

proaches to ripple formation is the quantum mechanical study of the membrane and the

phonon-electron interaction as a mechanism for rippling [7, 8]. Since the graphene Debye
temperature is TD ∼ 1000 K, the quantum treatment of graphene seems justiﬁed at room
temperature. Perturbation treatments point to the vanishing of the renormalized bending

energy of the membrane as a possible mechanism for ripple formation [8, 10]. The desta-

bilizing eﬀects of quantum ﬂuctuations on the bending rigidity of crystalline membranes

(without electron-phonon interaction) have been considered in [19]. Within equilibrium the-

ory and without phonon-electron interaction, the eﬀect of (Matsubara) frequency-dependent

renormalization of the anharmonic coupling after elimination of in-plane phonons has been

considered in [20].

Recent experimental studies emphasize buckling eﬀects in suspended graphene, as buck-

ling is more easily characterized than ripple formation and can strongly aﬀect the design of

new graphene-based devices. Long-range buckling of the graphene sheet is pronounced near

defects and dislocations [21–26]. In [27], buckled bilayer and monolayer graphene are fully

clamped to circular holes in an electrode. Buckling is induced by the fabrication process

so that the sheets are buckled and strain-free at zero applied electric ﬁeld. In the exper-

iment, an external electric ﬁeld pressures the membrane and induces a sudden change in

the buckling direction (a “snap-through” eﬀect). A relation between the critical pressure

and the bending rigidity of bilayer graphene provides a measure of the latter. Even when

2

the graphene layer is not buckled initially, a strong enough electrostatic force can produce

irreversible buckling [28]. A spontaneous buckling eﬀect (“mirror buckling”) is also found by

Xu et al. in [29]. This eﬀect is systematically studied in [15], in a complementary approach

to that in [27]. In [15], the authors study a suspended graphene monolayer using scanning

tunnelling microscopy (STM). The microscope tip is located on the centre of an initially

non-buckled layer. The STM keeps a constant current and a variable potential between the

tip and the sample. Once the current is ﬁxed at a suﬃciently high value, the sample buckles

when the potential increases, similarly to the experiments in [27, 28].

These experimental eﬀorts have their theoretical counterpart through diﬀerent approaches

to the buckling of two dimensional (2D) layers such as graphene. A broad overview of the

eﬀects of strain in graphene and its relation with its electrical properties can be found in

[30]. The study of spontaneous buckling in graphene due to doping is carried out in [7]. In

polymerized membranes, buckling occurs below a critical temperature [31]. Phenomenolog-

ical models of crystalline membranes coupled to spins undergoing Glauber dynamics also

indicate that there are critical temperatures below which the membranes buckle [12, 13].

In [9], Guinea et al. have developed a model for suspended graphene based in the coupling

between ﬂexural phonons and electrons. They consider a 2D membrane in equilibrium that

is embedded in a 2 + d dimension space, where there are d dimensional out-of-membrane

displacements (d = 1 in the physical situation). Then they eliminate the in-plane phonons,

ignore the frequency dependence of the resulting couplings, use the self-consistent screening
approximation and perform a saddle-point analysis of the free energy in the limit as d → ∞.
The resulting saddle-point equations (SPEs) are time-independent and will be analyzed in

the present paper. They consist of one von K´arm´an type plate equation for the physical

out-of-plane displacement coupled to two equations for two auxiliary ﬁelds: one “scalar”

stress associated to membrane curvature and a ﬁeld associated to charge ﬂuctuations. We

expect these equations to describe buckling and ripples of the graphene membrane in a

stable stationary (equilibrium) conﬁguration after all possible transients have decayed. We

ﬁnd ﬂat membrane solutions with constant non-zero auxiliary ﬁelds. The linearization of

the stationary SPEs about these solutions accompanied by appropriate boundary conditions

provide an eigenvalue problem that yields critical values of temperature and membrane size

corresponding to the bifurcation of buckling states from the ﬂat membrane. Why?

The stationary SPEs provide stationary solutions to not yet derived dynamic SPEs that

3

should describe the graphene membrane out of equilibrium. Among them, we have found

the stationary ﬂat membrane solution. Other solutions may bifurcate from it at appropriate

parameter values. To ﬁnd them, we have to solve the eigenvalue problem that governs the

linear stability of the stationary ﬂat membrane solution to dynamic SPEs. The correspond-

ing eigenvalues give the growth of disturbances about the stationary solution. We do not

know the precise shape of the dynamic SPEs but we may surmise that stationary solutions

bifurcating from the ﬂat membrane appear when these eigenvalues are zero. But linearized

dynamic SPEs with zero eigenvalues are the same as linearized stationary SPEs, which we

know from [9]. These linearized stationary SPEs have nonzero solutions only for particular

values of the constant auxiliary ﬁelds that correspond to critical temperature and membrane

sizes. The eigenmodes solving these equations give the shape of the buckling states near

bifurcation points. A combination of eigenmodes may characterize ripples in graphene.

The rest of the paper is as follows. In section II we brieﬂy revise the derivation of the

stationary saddle-point equations [9] and write them in real (not Fourier) space. In section

III, we ﬁnd the ﬂat membrane solution of the SPEs for constant auxiliary ﬁelds. In Section

IV, we linearize the plate equation that forms part of the stationary SPE about the ﬂat

solution and add appropriate boundary conditions for a ﬁnite circular graphene sheet. Thus

we obtain an eigenvalue problem for critical values of the constant auxiliary ﬁelds. From the

critical auxiliary ﬁelds, we get critical values of temperature and membrane size at which

non-ﬂat buckled solutions may bifurcate from ﬂat ones. The linearized plate equations are

solved for a circular monolayer of graphene with two diﬀerent boundary conditions corre-

sponding to a free graphene layer and to a clamped sample. We obtain diﬀerent eigenmodes

(corresponding to vertical deformations of the layer) together with their respective critical

temperatures and radii. The critical radii allow us to predict the minimal size that allows

a graphene layer to buckle. Moreover the combination of the diﬀerent bifurcating modes

could be used to characterize ripples in graphene. The last section contains our conclusions.

II. MODEL AND SADDLE-POINT EQUATIONS

In [9], Guinea, Le Doussal and Wiese have considered the graphene sheet to be a 2D

membrane embedded in a larger space of dimension d + 2 and interacting with Nf d copies

of a free Dirac fermion. The real physical system has Nf = 4 (four ﬂavors, two valleys and

4

two spins) and d = 1 but Guinea et al have derived saddle-point equations involving the
out-of-plane displacement in the limit as d → ∞. Here we analyze buckling of the graphene
membrane using the saddle-point equations. Let us brieﬂy recall the model, the saddle-point

equations and their meaning. The model Hamiltonian consists of:

• The deformation energy of the graphene sheet is the sum of kinetic energy, Hkin, and

of curvature and elastic energy, Helas, with

d2x[κ(∇2ha)2 + λu2

ii + 2µu2

ij].

Helas =

Nf d(cid:88)

Here ui, i = 1, 2, are the in-plane phonon displacements, ha, a = 1, ..., d are the out-of-
plane ﬂexural phonon modes, uij := 1

2(∂iuj + ∂jui + ∂iha∂jha), λ and µ are the Lam´e

constants, and κ is the bending energy.

• The energy of the free Dirac fermions (in units such that  = 1),

γ=1

Here σ = (σx, σy) are the Pauli matrices, vF is the Fermi velocity of Dirac electrons
a = 5 eV (a = 1.4 ˚A is the side of a graphene

hexagon).

• The electron-phonon coupling

(4)

where δρ(x) is the the charge distribution on the graphene layer, ρ0 is the equilibrium

carrier density, and g0 is in the range between 4 and 50 eV.

• Finally the Coulomb interaction has the form

(5)

where V0(q) = 2πe2
is the Fourier transform of the electrostatic potential, V0(r) =
0q
e2/(0r), 0 is the dielectric constant of the environment and −e < 0 is the charge of
the electron.

5

Once all interactions are deﬁned, the resultant Hamiltonian is integrated over the in-plane

phonons, leading to a coupled theory of ﬂexural phonon modes and electrons. The frequency

dependence of the resulting couplings is ignored, as it is important only for temperatures

below 90 K [20], that we do not consider here. In this process, the Coulomb interaction

becomes

ˆV (q) =

The eﬀective Hamiltonian, depending only on the electrons and ﬂexural phonon modes,

is used to build a Matsubara equilibrium partition function. For later convenience, this

partition function is transformed using two ﬂuctuating auxiliary ﬁelds, σ and α, deﬁned

through the relation,

linear combination of Φ(x) and the charge disturbance δρ(x), whereas α(x) is a nonlocal

Henceforth from this equation we suppress the subscript 0 in all average quantities.

Let us now set µ = 0 as in [9]. It is important to note that the ﬂat membrane h(x) = 0

is always a solution of (??). However, the right side of (16) is not zero for h(x) = 0 and

therefore the trivial solution (h = σ = α = 0) is not a valid solution of the SPEs. As we will

see in the next section, h = 0 and non-zero σ and α is a valid solution. Nonzero auxiliary

ﬁelds σ and α provide a residual stress that induces plate buckling and rippling below

a certain critical temperature and over a critical plate size.

In a mathematically related

phenomenon, a growing bacterial bioﬁlm can be modeled as a plate with a growth tensor

that modiﬁes the elastic part of strain, acts as residual stress and may trigger ripples (called

wrinkles in that application) [32]. The critical growth term may then be sought by solving

an appropriate eigenvalue problem for h(x) coming from the linearized plate equations [33].

III. FLAT MEMBRANE WITH CONSTANT AUXILIARY FIELDS

We now seek simple solutions of equations (??)-(??) and (16) with µ = 0, σ(x) = σ (a

constant), α(x) = α (a constant) and h(x) = 0. Using that

IV. LINEARIZED EQUATION AND EIGENVALUE PROBLEM

We want to ascertain the linear stability of the solution found in the previous section,

h = 0 and constant auxiliary ﬁelds. For this we need to know the dynamics and to linearize

the corresponding SPEs about this solution. Let us assume that the dynamic SPEs are

so that

(24)

are the stationary SPEs (??)-(??) and (16). Let u0(p) be the ﬂat solution h = 0 and constant

σ(p) and α(p) of (20) and (22). Here p is a bifurcation parameter, later to be identiﬁed as

the temperature or the radius of a circular graphene membrane. Linear stability about u0
follows from substituting u(t) = u0 + eυtU in (??) and keeping terms of order U in the

(u0(p); p)U = υ
δ∂2u/∂t2 are functionals acting upon U ≡ U(x). For appropriate values
where δF

linearly stable. Then zero eigenvalues or eigenvalues with zero real part give the critical

values at which non-ﬂat solutions bifurcate from the ﬂat constant solution. Stationary

solutions bifurcate from u0(p) at those critical values of p for which υ = 0. At such pc, (??)

becomes

δF
δu

(u0(pc); pc)U = 0.

(26)

While the dynamic SPEs are not known, (??) are the known linearized stationary SPEs

about the ﬂat constant solution. We consider (??) as an eigenvalue problem for the critical

values pc and proceed to determine “eigenvalues” pc. The corresponding eigenvectors U

are buckling modes of the membrane issuing forth from the ﬂat constant solution. When

many of these modes become active we may have generated a variety of rippling states of

the graphene sheet.

To solve the linearized stationary SPEs, we need appropriate boundary conditions. To

solve the linearized plate equation (??), we need the value of σij in (??) for the constant
σ and α of (20) and (22). Now u = ∆−1σ solves the equation ∆u = σ with appropriate
boundary conditions. A solution is

u =

σ
4

|x|2 + u0, ∆u0 = 0.

For a circular plate with zero data Dirichlet boundary conditions at r = R the solution is

u = σ

4 (r2 − R2). Then, by (??) and (??), σij = σδij/2, and (??) becomes

∆2h =

There are diﬀerent eigenvalue problems associated to solving Equation (27) with diﬀerent

boundary conditions for a ﬁnite graphene membrane. Each of these problems yield its critical

temperature and size and allows us to know the shape of diﬀerent eigenmodes that appear

as buckled solutions of the suspended layer of graphene. We consider a ﬁnite circular layer

of graphene with a free border (natural boundary conditions) or a graphene sheet clamped

to a circular hole. Suspended graphene sheets are clamped at their boundaries but the case

of a free border is easier to treat mathematically, so we start by analyzing it.

The natural boundary conditions to solve (27) for a free circular graphene layer of radius

Let us ﬁrst solve the eigenvalue problem for H = ∆h: ∆H − σ

(29) corresponds to the ﬁrst zero γ1,0 = 2.4048 of the Bessel function J0(x). Note that

γ1,0 < γ1,1 < γ1,2 < γ2,0 < γ1,3. Thus there are two eigenvalues corresponding to azimuthal

eigenfunctions (m = 1, 2) between the ﬁrst two eigenvalues corresponding to radially sym-

metric eigenfunctions with m = 0.

The solution of ∆h = H that satisﬁes the other boundary condition is

We are interested in computing the critical temperature and radii. To this end, we use

(29) with equations (20) and (22), and ﬁnd that ripples appear below the critical temperature

Here Tn,m is the temperature (measured in Kelvin) at which the mode hn,m appears and R

lowest value considered in [9]) and κ = 1 eV. At room temperature, equation (??) gives us

B. Clamped Membrane

In this more realistic case, the boundary conditions are ˜h = 0 and ∂r

˜h = 0 at r = R
instead of (28). We use ˜h instead of h to distinguish the out-of-plane displacement in the

clamped case. Following the same procedure as for equations (29) and (30), we get

which agrees with (??) for m = 0.

According to (41), the critical radii are given by (??) with γn,m+1 instead of γn,m. Then the

critical radii of table III are greater than those in table II, and buckling of a clamped graphene

membrane should be observable only for radii over 24 nm. Thus a clamped membrane

remains ﬂat for larger radii than in the case of natural free boundary conditions. This is

according to our intuition that it is harder to buckle a clamped membrane than a membrane

with a free border. The lowest possible value of σ in (29) corresponds to γ1,1 = 3.8317.

Note that γ1,1 < γ1,2 < γ1,3 < γ2,1. Again there are two eigenvalues corresponding to

azimuthal eigenfunctions (m = 1, 2) between the ﬁrst two eigenvalues corresponding to

radially symmetric eigenfunctions with m = 0. These ﬁrst four modes given by (42) are

depicted in ﬁgure 2.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, the stationary saddle-point equations give the vertical displacement of a

graphene membrane and auxiliary ﬁelds associated to curvature and to charge ﬂuctuations,

provided elasticity and phonon-electron interaction are considered [9]. We have solved these

equations for a ﬂat circular graphene sheet under constant auxiliary ﬁelds. We have then

solved the SPEs linearized about the ﬂat membrane solution and subject to either free or

clamped boundary conditions. The latter problem has nonzero solutions only for discrete

values of the auxiliary ﬁelds. These discrete values correspond to critical values of tem-

perature and membrane radius at which buckling membrane solutions issue forth from the

ﬂat membrane. The ﬂat membrane is stable only for temperatures larger than critical and

radii smaller than critical. For an inﬁnite membrane, the predicted critical temperature is

extremely large and unphysical (186,000 K). However, critical radii at room temperature are

in the nanometer range. Diﬀerent modes of membrane buckling appear below speciﬁc criti-

cal temperatures and over speciﬁc critical radii, see tables II and III. The stability of these

modes is to be analytically determined, but experiments describing rippling [3] and buckling

[15] of graphene show that the ﬂat solution is not stable in most cases: Flat graphene has

only been observed when it stands over a substrate [36].

The calculated critical radii (tables II and III) suggest that the diﬀerent modes appearing

in ﬁgures 1 and 2 could be observed for a speciﬁc temperature and membrane size. This

brings the opportunity to develop new experiments, as no buckling should appear below the

minimum critical radius Rc. Similar experimental procedures to the ones in [27–29], where

suspended graphene layers were forced to buckle using an external electrical potential or a

STM, could be used to determine the value of Rc and the validity of our results. For this

purpose, suspended graphene layers may be clamped to holes of diﬀerent dimensions, under

diﬀerent temperatures. Checking when the layer may or not buckle, it should be possible to

get a better estimation of g and κ by ﬁtting the results of experiments with equation (32).

15

A diﬀerent approach to study the eﬀects due to the existence of non-ﬂat modes would

be experiments with graphene resonators [34, 35]. In this setting, when the external driving

force is suﬃciently strong to deform the graphene layer close to one of the stable buckling

modes (away from the ﬂat conﬁguration), the response of the resonator should be extremely

nonlinear.

Instead of oscillating around a single potential well (more or less parabolic)

corresponding to the rippled conﬁguration, the system may oscillate under inﬂuence of two

diﬀerent potential wells (the buckling modes). This eﬀect could be measured by observing

oscillation damping once the driving force is turned oﬀ.

Characterization of ripples in suspended graphene is not yet accurate enough to compare

with our results. Once the experimental techniques have been improved, experiments with

suspended graphene layers clamped to holes of diﬀerent radii should show ripples that are

combination of the possible bifurcating modes for these membranes (table III).

The study of diﬀerent solutions of the SPEs with position-dependent auxiliary ﬁelds σ

and α is left as future work. From a theoretical point of view, it is also interesting to take

into account the inﬂuence of external forces, such as an electrostatic force, and to study the

resulting dynamical eﬀects. Then we may be able to reproduce the transition from the ﬂat

membrane with superimposed ripples to the buckled membrane and compare with existing

STM experimental results [15].

These are two equations for three unknowns, σ, α and µ, so that we can give a value to µ

and solve for σ and α. We have already seen the consequences of setting µ = 0. What do

we get from other choices?

1. Assume that µ is selected so that µ + vF Λ = 0 and therefore the right hand side of

(B1) (which represents the Fermionic propagator in real space for x = 0) becomes ﬁnite as
Λ → ∞. Following the same steps as in previous sections, e.g. using equations (21) and
(29), we get (the minus sign corresponds to g < 0)

The right hand side of this equation contains the product R/β = RT . This produces a

critical radius (at which the graphene sheet starts buckling) that decreases when the tem-

perature increases. This is unphysical because increasing temperature would favor rippling,

contrary to experimental evidence [16].

Once the numerical values of the constants are taken into account, we notice that the left

hand side of (??) is positive, whereas the second term in the right hand side of this equation

(the minus sign corresponds to g < 0) is proportional to T R, and this again produces the

same unphysical eﬀect as before.

Thus we conclude that the physically meaningful choice of chemical potential is µ = 0 as

in [9]. We do not renormalize the parameters of the model and leave the natural ultraviolet

and infrared cutoﬀs Λ = 2π/a and q0 = 2π/R, respectively, in terms of the lattice constant
