Abstract The gravitational interaction between two objects on similar orbits can effect no-
ticeable changes in the orbital evolution even if the ratio of their masses to that of the central
body is vanishingly small. Christou (2005) observed an occasional resonant lock in the dif-
ferential node ∆Ω between two members in the Himalia irregular satellite group of Jupiter
in the N-body simulations (corresponding mass ratio ∼ 10−9). Using a semianalytical ap-
proach, we have reproduced this phenomenon. We also demonstrate the existence of two
additional types of resonance, involving angle differences ∆ω and ∆ (Ω + ϖ) between two
group members. These resonances cause secular oscillations in eccentricity and/or inclina-
tion on timescales ∼ 1 Myr. We locate these resonances in (a,e,i) space and analyse their
topological structure. In subsequent N-body simulations, we conﬁrm these three resonances
and ﬁnd a fourth one involving ∆ϖ. In addition, we study the occurrence rates and the sta-
bility of the four resonances from a statistical perspective by integrating 1000 test particles
for 100 Myr. We ﬁnd ∼ 10− 30 librators for each of the resonances. Particularly, the nodal
resonance found by Christou is the most stable: 2 particles are observed to stay in libration
for the entire integration.

1 Introduction

All planets in the solar system except Mercury and Venus have satellites (see, e.g., Murray
and Dermott 1999). Satellites are subject to many types of perturbations, for instance, solar
forcing and the oblateness of the host planet.

The Sun’s gravity induces a satellite’s orbit to precess at a rate, (see, for example, Inna-

nen et al. 1997)

˙ϖ(cid:12) ≈ 3k2m(cid:12)

where ϖ is the longitude of pericentre of the satellite, k2 the gravitational constant; m(cid:12) and
a(cid:12) are the solar mass and semimajor axis of the Sun’s relative motion with respect to the

planet; n is the satellite’s mean motion and n =(cid:112)k2m/a3 (where m is the mass of the host

planet and a the semimajor axis of the satellite). On the other hand, the oblateness of the
host planet also causes the orbit to precess at the rate (e.g., Roy 1978)

For a satellite with a below this value, its orbital evolution is mainly controlled by the plane-
tary oblateness, while one with a above this value is governed by solar perturbations. Based
on this, Burns (1986) deﬁned irregular satellites as those whose orbital evolution is domi-
nated by the Sun, i.e., with a > acrit (see also, Goldreich 1966). Thus inherently, this deﬁni-
tion mostly places constraints on the average distance from the satellite to the host planet.
Apart from the size, their orbits are often highly eccentric and inclined compared to the
regular satellites.
The eccentricity and inclination of the irregulars are generally high and their distribution
in [0,1) and [0◦,180◦) is not uniform (see, e.g., Jewitt and Haghighipour 2007). For example,
the inclinations of them are far from 90◦. This feature can be explained by Kozai-Lidov
dynamics (Lidov 1962; Kozai 1962) that involves the secular perturbation from the Sun.
√
Under solar forcing, the eccentricity and inclination of the satellite are coupled in such a way
1− e2 cosi is conserved while the eccentricity
that the vertical angular momentum H ∝
e and inclination i of the satellite may experience large-amplitude oscillations, especially
when i is high. This mechanism causes the absence of satellites with inclinations around 90◦
(Carruba et al. 2002). We will discuss this effect in detail in Sect. 3.

Most irregular satellites reside on retrograde, rather than prograde, orbits; this relates to
the so-called evection phenomenon (Yokoyama et al. 2008; Frouard et al. 2010). Evection
is linked to the mean motion of the Sun. If a satellite is too far from the planet, it will be
so perturbed by the Sun that its longitude of pericentre ϖ precesses at a rate comparable to
the solar mean motion. In this case, the angle ψ = ϖ − λ(cid:12) (where λ(cid:12) is the mean longitude
√
1− e2 may oscillate strongly and the
of Sun) may librate; the angular momentum G ∝
eccentricity may grow from ∼ 0 to 0.6 (Frouard et al. 2010). Thus the evection effect places
constraints on the stability of irregular satellites and inﬂuences their orbital distribution.
Furthermore, this effect is not symmetrical with respect to the inclination of 90◦ because
for prograde orbits, ϖ = Ω + ω (where Ω is the longitude of the ascending node and ω the
argument of pericentre) while for retrograde orbits, ϖ is the difference of the two angles.
As a result, the eccentricity of a prograde orbit is excited more efﬁciently than a retrograde
one, providing a possible mechanism to explain why the retrograde regime harbours more
irregular satellites (Nesvorn´y et al. 2003).

Secular Resonances Between Bodies on Close Orbits

A prominent feature of the irregular satellite population is that they form groups or
families (Nesvorn´y et al. 2003; Sheppard and Jewitt 2003). Members of the same family
have similar orbital elements. Families are thought to be the products of collisional evo-
lution. Nesvorn´y et al. (2003) used the Gauss equations to infer the degree of dispersion
within different groups of irregular satellites. They found that the Himalia family is more
widely dispersed than expected for a group of collisional fragments. Beaug´e et al. (2006)
and Beaug´e and Nesvorn´y (2007) developed a high order analytical method and used it to
calculate accurate precession rates of irregular satellites and to study the dynamical struc-
ture of the Kozai resonance. Based on this method, they determined the locations of secular
resonances and compared them with the positions of known irregular satellites; also, a new
family around Pasiphae was identiﬁed. Hinse et al. (2010) applied the MEGNO technique to
jovian irregular satellites and identiﬁed chaotic and quasi-periodic regions; they also found
some high-order mean motion resonances. Using similar methods, Frouard et al. (2011)
reported a number of resonances related to the Great Inequality and revealed the chaotic
diffusion in different irregular satellite groups.

All of the above work has assumed the irregular satellites to be massless. However, in
a manner similar to asteroid families (e.g., Carruba et al. 2003) a massive member of a
satellite family could exert strong perturbations on the smaller members and scatter their
orbits; Christou (2005) found that, gravitational scattering by Himalia operating over the
age of the solar system could be responsible for the large velocity dispersion observed by
Nesvorn´y et al. (2003). Christou used this effect to place constraints on the mass of Himalia.
He also observed a transient resonant lock between the nodes of Himalia and Lysithea,
another satellite in the family. Thus we suppose a massive member could have signiﬁcant
effects on the orbital evolution of the group and this phenomenon needs further study. Here,
as a case study, we focus our attention on the Himalia group of Jupiter and particularly on
the resonances identiﬁed by Christou.

The paper is organised as follows: in Sect. 2, we introduce the Himalia group, the phe-
nomenon of “nodal libration” and the model used to study it. Then in Sect. 3, we describe our
semianalytical approach to model the nodal libration and introduce other resonant phenom-
ena. The results of N-body simulations are presented in Sect. 4. Finally, Sect. 5 is devoted
to the conclusions and discussions.

2 The Himalia group, a nodal resonance and our model

The Himalia group is a prograde jovian irregular satellite group with ﬁve members: Himalia,
Elara, Lysithea, Leda and Dia. Himalia is the largest member that carries the group name;
it is at least 8 times more massive than any of the other four known members1. Emelyanov
(2005) studied the perturbation of Himalia on other satellites and estimated the mass to be
k2m = (0.28± 0.04) km3/s2, consistent with the estimate of Christou (2005) based on its
scattering effect. We adopt this mass estimate throughout the paper. The mean semimajor
axis, eccentricity and inclination of the group are 0.078 AU, 0.18 and 28◦, respectively.

In Christou (2005), where the main purpose was to study the inﬂuence of gravitational
scattering within the Himalia group, the effects of the Sun, Saturn and jovian oblateness
(corrected for the additional mass of Galilean satellites) were considered; Himalia and Elara

1 Dia was discovered in 2000 and then lost. It was recently recovered by S. S. Sheppard; see http:
//dtm.carnegiescience.edu/news/long-lost-moon-jupiter-found. For the mass estimates of
the members, see http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?sat_phys_par. For orbital elements, see http://ssd.
jpl.nasa.gov/?sat_elem. Parameters of other satellites from the latter two links will be used in Sect. 5.

were assumed to be massive and other family members were massless. In such a conﬁgu-
ration, it was found that the difference between the longitudes of the nodes of Lysithea and
Himalia ∆Ω = ΩL − ΩH could occasionally librate around π on a timescale of 1 Myr with
the amplitude of the oscillation in inclination being ∼ 0.1◦ (see ﬁgs. 4 and 5 of that work).
Christou also reported that, on entering and leaving the libration, signiﬁcant changes in the
inclination can occur. This provides a fast channel for the evolution of inclination and may
contribute to the large relative velocity dispersion in the Himalia group. We refer to this
phenomenon as “nodal resonance” or “nodal libration” hereafter.

Here, our goal is to speciﬁcally study this dynamical phenomenon. To isolate the relevant
dynamics, we work within a restricted four-body problem model containing Jupiter, the Sun,
a massive Himalia and a massless test particle; see Fig 1. Here, all bodies revolve around
Jupiter (in the relative sense). The Sun is assumed to be on a circular orbit.

Fig. 1 Illustration of the system that consists of Jupiter, the Sun, Himalia and a particle

In the following sections, we tackle this four-body problem with both semianalytical

and fully numerical methods.

3 Semianalytical approach

Our strategy is to split the four-body problem of Jupiter-Sun-Himalia-particle into two re-
stricted three-body problems that can be tackled separately using perturbation analysis. The
ﬁrst includes Jupiter, the Sun and Himalia. Since the mass of Himalia is vanishingly small
compared with those of Jupiter and the Sun, it is assumed to be also massless in this part.
Thus Himalia and the particle can be studied using the same technique. The second three-
body problem is comprised of Jupiter, massive Himalia and the massless particle. We de-
scribe in detail the methods dealing with the two restricted three-body problems in the fol-
lowing subsections. Then we explain how we combine the two.

In this paper, we use a normalised unit system in which the Solar mass is 1; jovian semi-
major axis is 1; gravitational constant is 1; thus the orbital period of Jupiter is approximately
2π; in practice, we have used 2π in time conversion for the N-body simulations described
in Sect. 4.

3.1 Kozai dynamics in the Jupiter-Sun-satellite restricted three-body problem

In the ﬁrst instance, solar perturbations dominate the evolution of Himalia and the particle.
A substantial body of literature has dealt with such “hierarchical” planet-Sun-satellite prob-
lems and has discussed the Kozai-Lidov mechanism (Lidov 1962; Kozai 1962). There, the
Hamiltonian of the system is expanded in terms of the ratio of semimajor axis of the satellite
to that of the Sun (we denote this ratio as α = a/a(cid:12) hereafter) and only the leading order
terms (of order α2; the “quadrupole” Hamiltonian) are retained. Actually, in our simple
model, the Sun has zero eccentricity, causing the octupole Hamiltonian (of order α3) to be
zero (see, e.g., Krymolowski and Mazeh 1999; Naoz et al. 2013). Then the mean anomalies
of the Sun and Himalia are eliminated. Owing to a “happy coincidence” (Lidov and Ziglin
1976), the quadrupole secular Hamiltonian is integrable. Speciﬁcally, this Hamiltonian is

(cid:2)(cid:0)−15e2 cos (2ω) + 9e2 + 6(cid:1)cos2 i + 15e2 cos (2ω)− 3e2 − 2(cid:3) ,

F =

k2m(cid:12)a2
16a3(cid:12)

(4)

in which k2 is the gravitational constant and m(cid:12) the mass of the Sun; a and a(cid:12) are semimajor
axes of the satellite and the Sun; e, i and ω are the satellite’s orbital eccentricity, inclination
and argument of pericentre, respectively (Kozai 1962; Naoz et al. 2013); this Hamiltonian
and its simpliﬁed forms will be referred to as the “Kozai Hamiltonian” hereafter. Apparently,
the Hamiltonian F and semimajor axis a are conserved. As the longitude of the ascending
√
node Ω does not appear in Eq. (4), the vertical component of the angular momentum H ∝
1− e2 cosi is constant as well. For a dynamical system governed by this Hamiltonian,
√
ω may librate around ±π/2 while the angular momentum G ∝
1− e2 may experience
large amplitude oscillation, giving rise to the Kozai resonance. All four giant planets have
such satellites (Nicholson et al. 2008). The libration in ω requires the inclination to exceed
≈ 40◦; this is not the situation for the Himalia group. Generally, such evolution under solar
perturbation is referred to as a “Kozai cycle”. In Kozai theory, the reference plane is the
orbital plane of Jupiter; this frame is used throughout the paper.

With this Hamiltonian, we can obtain the expressions for the nodal and apsidal preces-

sion rates of the satellite. The Hamiltonian will be further simpliﬁed in Subsect. 3.3.

3.2 Satellite interaction in the Jupiter-Himalia-particle restricted three-body problem

Here, we consider the subsystem comprised of Jupiter, Himalia and a massless test particle.
Since the orbits of the two satellites are close and may cross, the traditional expansion
of the disturbing function (e.g., Murray and Dermott 1999) is not applicable here. To tackle
this, we resort to treating the problem under the framework of coorbital theory. The crucial
differences between coorbital theory and the conventional treatment lie in the expansion in
the disturbing function and in the elimination of the mean anomalies. In coorbital theory,
no expansion is made with respect to the ratio of semimajor axes. The mean anomalies
of the two orbits are eliminated in a combined manner so that the difference in the mean
longitudes ∆λ remains. This enables the study of the variation of the relative semimajor axis
∆a (see, for example, Message 1966; Morais 1999). When studying the secular evolution of
the system, ∆λ is eliminated.
We follow H´enon and Petit (1986) (see also, Namouni 1999) and use the relative quan-
tities, e.g., the relative vector eccentricity er = eP − eH = (eP cosϖP − eH cosϖH,eP sinϖP −
eH sinϖH) (where ϖ is the longitude of pericentre) of the particle relative to Himalia.

6

Daohai Li, Apostolos A. Christou

We assume that Himalia and the particle are on similar orbits (i.e., with similar semima-
jor axes, eccentricities and inclinations), that their eccentricities and inclinations are much
smaller than unity and that their total mass is far smaller than that of the central body,
Jupiter. The semimajor axes, eccentricities and inclinations of the members of the group
are restricted to small ranges and the eccentricities are relatively small, satisfying the re-
quirement of coorbital theory. However, the inclination of the Himalia group is about 0.5
rad. As the main purpose of this section is to describe the dynamical structure qualita-
tively but not to provide a precise quantitative description of the orbital evolution, we di-
vide all inclinations by a factor of 3 in this section wherever coorbital theory is involved.
In this way, the eccentricities and inclinations are all around 0.17, better suiting the expan-
sion described below. We will brieﬂy discuss what the situation is if we apply the original
inclinations in Sect. 5. In this setting, the motion of the two satellites can be expressed
in a frame whose origin revolves around Jupiter on a circular orbit of semimajor axis a0
(a0 ∈ (min(aH,aP),max(aH,aP))); the frame also rotates along its z-axis at an angular ve-
locity of n0 =
0 (where mJ and mH are masses of Jupiter and Himalia,
respectively; the particle is massless). Omitting higher order terms in e and i and assuming
that the two satellites are not generally interacting, the Cartesian coordinates of Himalia in
this rotating frame can be expressed as the following functions of time (H´enon and Petit
1986; Namouni 1999)

k2(mJ + mH)/a3

(cid:113)

xH = aH(hH cosn0t + kH sinn0t) + (aH − a0)

where aH, hH = eH cosϖH, kH = eH sinϖH, pH = iH cosΩH, qH = iH sinΩH and λH are the
regular orbital elements of Himalia; similar equations apply for the particle. From the lin-
earity of these expressions, it can be seen that analogous expressions exist for the motion of
the particle relative to Himalia and the relative e and i are constant.

On account of a massive Himalia, the relative eccentricity and inclination begin to
evolve. It has been shown the secular evolution of relative e and i observe the following
potential (Luciani et al. 1995; Namouni 1999)

The coorbital secular potential (6) causes variations in er and ir; it also gives rise to
precession in ϖr and Ωr (Namouni 1999). These effects, in turn, are reﬂected in the evolution
of the particle’s elements (ϖP,eP) and (ΩP,iP).

3.3 Secular dynamics of the Jupiter-Sun-Himalia-particle system

Having isolated the relevant dynamics in the two sub-problems discussed in Subsects. 3.1
and 3.2, we now want to combine them. This is done so that both Himalia and the test
particle experience solar perturbation through the Kozai Hamiltonian (4); to this we add
the gravitational inﬂuence on the particle from Himalia by applying (9) to potential (6) and
adding the corresponding variation rates to the particle. Thus the equations of motion are

˙σH = f (cid:12)(σH)

˙σP = f (cid:12)(σP) + f coorb(σr) ,

and

(10)
where σ is an arbitrary orbital element; f (cid:12) refers to the solar perturbation and is a func-
tion of the elements of Himalia or the particle; f coorb represents the contribution from the
coorbital interaction potential and is a function of the relative elements. We now have an
eight-dimensional system of (ϖH,eH;ϖP,eP;ΩH,iH;ΩP,iP).

The evolution of the particle is generally dominated by solar perturbations even when
perturbations by both the Sun and Himalia are considered. We use a simple example to
demonstrate this point. According to Eqs. (4) and (6), and for the nominal orbits of Himalia
and Lysithea (as the particle), the timescales of precession in ϖP and ΩP induced by the
Ω ∼ 2π/ ˙Ω coorb ≈ 2.8× 107.
ϖ ∼ 2π/ ˙ϖ coorb ≈ 2.7× 107 and τcoorb
coorbital potential are τcoorb
For solar perturbations, the corresponding timescales are τ(cid:12)
ϖ ∼ 2π/ ˙ϖ(cid:12) ≈ 1.5 × 102 and
τ(cid:12)
Ω ∼ 2π/ ˙Ω(cid:12) ≈ 1.4×102. Noting that, according to Christou (2005), the timescale of nodal
libration is ∼ 106, thus the effects of a Kozai cycle should be considered as “fast” and can
be eliminated when tackling nodal libration.
Assuming that within a Kozai cycle, changes in eccentricity is small (∆e (cid:28) 1) and
applying some algebraic manipulations (see Appendix A for details), we have the following
“averaged” Kozai Hamiltonian

(cid:0)2 + 3e2(cid:1)(cid:0)1− 3cos2 i(cid:1) ,

FK = − k2m(cid:12)a2
16a3(cid:12)

(11)

where e and i are the “averaged” quantities over a Kozai cycle compared to the original ones
in Eq. (4). With this Hamiltonian, the precession rates of Ω and ϖ are constant. Rates of
group members are close with similar a, e and i.

As shown above, the inﬂuence of Himalia is several orders of magnitude smaller than
that of the Sun. We suggest that, the libration in ∆Ω is only possible where d∆Ω /dt is
vanishingly small under solar perturbations. With the Hamiltonian (11), we deﬁne a surface
in (a,e,i) space where all points on it share the same nodal precession rate with Himalia:
˙Ω (a,e,i) = ˙Ω|H (since ˙Ω is a function depending only on a, e and i); we call this a Surface

8

of Equal Precession Rate (SEPR) in Ω. We show the SEPR in Fig. 2; it is conceptually sim-
ilar to those discussed in Williams and Faulkner (1981) in the contact of secular resonances
in the main asteroid belt. Note that, until now, we do not assume small eccentricity or incli-
nation for the Kozai Hamiltonian; thus the SEPR applies to the real Himalia group, whose
inclination is about 0.5 rad.

Fig. 2 The surface of equal precession rate in Ω in (a,e,i) space. The location of the surface is calculated
using the Kozai Hamiltonian (11) without expansion in eccentricity or inclination. Points on the surface share
the same precession rate as Himalia in Ω. The black square represents the location of Himalia

However, as the coorbital potential (6) results from an expansion in eccentricity and
inclination, combining it with the full expression for the Kozai potential (11) seems super-
ﬂuous. Hence, we also expand (11) in e and i, retaining terms up to order four to arrive at
the following Kozai Hamiltonian

(cid:0)2i4 − 9e2i2 − 6i2 + 6e2(cid:1) .

F = − k2m(cid:12)a2
16a3(cid:12)

(12)

(13)

(14)

We then rewrite the Hamiltonian in normalised Poincar´e conjugate variables, and again we
adopt expansions in e and i. The variables are

¯g = −ϖ = −(Ω + ω), ¯G = e2/2;

¯h = −Ω , ¯H = i2/2.

Under the new variable set, the Kozai Hamiltonian becomes

(cid:0)2 ¯H2 − 9 ¯G ¯H − 3 ¯H + 3 ¯G(cid:1) .

F = − km(cid:12)a3/2

On the right-hand side of the above expressions, ( ¯g, ¯G) and (¯h, ¯H) are conjugate normalised
Poincar´e variables with subscripts “H” and “P” referring to Himalia and the particle, respec-
tively. On the left-hand side, angles (represented with lower-cased letters) with subscript “f”
are faster compared to those with subscript “s”, since the former are differences between,
while the latter are identical to, the original angles; the conjugate momenta are represented
with capital letters.

Thus the Kozai Hamiltonian of both Himalia and the particle assumes the following

The coorbital potential (6) is a branch function. Note that within the satellite group,
the quantity ar = (aP − aH)/a0 is always small. Taking the orbital elements of Lysithea for
example, ar ≈ 0.02 while er is of order 10−1. Thus the condition er|cosωr| < ar is rarely
satisﬁed and the potential form (7) dominates. We omit the other form and presume that the

ticle and Himalia. Hence, any effects that operate on timescales comparable to 2π/ ˙Ω are
considered “fast” (cf. transformation (15)) and we need to eliminate them. Since we have
assumed constant eccentricity and inclination in the Kozai theory (11) and (14), there is
nothing to remove in the Kozai Hamiltonian. However, the short timescale effects in the
coorbital potential (6) need elimination. We proceed as follows. First, we substitute the vari-
ables in the coorbital potential to express it in the same variables as the Kozai Hamiltonian
(16). Noting that the fast angles are controlled primarily by the Kozai potential, they precess
evenly with time (cf. Eq. (16)). Hence we perform two ﬁnite integrations and arrive at the
“slow” coorbital potential2:

We have now reached a system devoid of “fast” effects, i.e., those operating on timescales
similar to a Kozai cycle. Note that the coorbital potential is not a Hamiltonian in these vari-
ables (we show this in the Appendix B). However, we can still write down the equations of
motion of the system as

Here f (cid:12)
s,g is the rate of solar-driven variation in ¯gs and is derived directly from partial differ-
entiation of the Kozai Hamiltonian (16). The derivation of the coorbital potential contribu-
tion f coorb
is not so straightforward. Using the potential (17) and the equations of
motion (9), we can express the variational rates of the relative variables hr and kr exerted by
Himalia. The rates of the orbital elements of the particle are related to these rates through
Eq. (10). Then the transformation (15) allows us to derive the rates f coorb
in Eq.
(19). Analogous relations exist for ¯hf and ¯Hs. In this way, we arrive at the above equations
of motion (19). In essence, what we have is a four-dimensional system of ( ¯gs; ¯Gf; ¯hs; ¯Hf).
∆Ω = ΩP − ΩH, ∆ϖ = ϖP − ϖH, eP and iP.

When describing the dynamics of the system, we still use the original orbital elements

and f coorb

3.4 General dynamics

With the equations of motion above, we are able to integrate the system (19) numerically to
investigate its evolution3. We run test integrations and ﬁnd that, at most locations in phase
space, the angles ∆Ω and ∆ϖ circulate with small amplitude oscillations in eP and iP. This
is not unexpected and results from the fact that, for positions in the (a,e,i) space far from the
SEPR, solar perturbations cause ∆Ω and ∆ϖ to circulate fast, while the coorbital potential
contributes minor changes to the precession rates and introduces small amplitude variations
in eP and iP.

However, when near the SEPR, Himalia can be as efﬁcient as the Sun in changing the

orbital evolution; we show this in the following subsections.

3.5 Nodal resonance

In Fig. 3, we show an example of nodal libration in ∆Ω in our integrations of Eq. (19).
As observed in Christou (2005), the angle ∆Ω librates around π. While the inclination
oscillates in concert with the libration in the nodal difference, the eccentricity undergoes
only small amplitude and short time-scale variations. In fact, the eccentricity is a quasi-
conserved quantity here and in the two-dimensional system in Subsect. 3.7, it is actually
constant. The timescale of nodal libration is of order 106 (∼ 1 Myr) and the changes in
inclination are of order 10−3. To prove the postulate that the librator oscillates around the
SEPR when in resonance, we plot the signed distance from the particle to the surface in the
same ﬁgure. From the plot, it is clear that, when above the SEPR, ∆Ω increases and vice

3 All integrations of the equations of motion derived from Kozai and/or coorbital theory are carried out
with a 7th order Runge-Kutta method; the step-size is adjusted with an 8th order error estimate. The single
step error tolerance is 10−14.

versa4. Inherently, when in nodal libration, the particle is restricted to be near the surface
and to cross it regularly. This also shows the dominance of the Sun.

bottom panel: ∆Ω (red) and the signed “distance” to the SEPR (blue); x-axis: time in our adopted unit. Since
what matters is not the absolute “distance” but the relative position of the librating particle with respect to the
SEPR, we use the quantity ∆i to represent this relation. ∆i is the distance from the particle to the point in the
SEPR with the same a and e. Thus ∆i > 0 means the test particle is above the SEPR and vice versa

dt |H and d(Ω +ϖ)

Using the same method in Subsect. 3.3, we ﬁnd that the SEPR in terms of the pericentre
˙ϖ(a,e,i) = ˙ϖ|H exists. Furthermore, the SEPRs corresponding to the angle combinations
d(ϖ−Ω )
|H can be readily com-
puted. We present them together with the SEPR in Ω in Fig. 4. The four surfaces share the
same intersection curve.
Using our semianalytical model, we ﬁnd that two of these three angles, ∆ω = ∆ (ϖ −
Ω ) = ωP − ωH and ∆ (Ω + ϖ) = (ΩP + ϖP)− (ΩH + ϖH), can librate. We show examples
of these resonances in Figs. 5 and 6. Interestingly, we do not ﬁnd libration in the angle
∆ϖ = ϖP − ϖH; instead there is only slow circulation near its SEPR; see Fig. 7.

(a,e,i) = d(Ω +ϖ)

In the case of the ∆ω resonance in Fig. 5, while the angle librates about π, the varia-
tions of eccentricity and inclination are anti-correlated. This behaviour is reminiscent of the
Kozai resonance (Kozai 1962). As we will show in the next subsection, the quasi-conserved
quantity is (e2
P)/2, the component of the angular momentum along the z-axis; we plot
this quantity in the same ﬁgure.

P + i2

For the resonance of ∆ (Ω +ϖ) in Fig. 6, the angle librates about 0 while the eccentricity

and inclination are correlated. The quasi-conserved quantity in this case is (e2

P − i2

P)/2.

What we have shown here are the examples where the angles librate. When outside
libration but still close to the SEPRs, the angles circulate slowly and monotonically increase

4 In fact, the node precesses with negative rates. Thus when above the SEPR, the test particle has smaller

absolute precession rate.

the same timescale and in concert, like the case of the angle ∆ϖ described below.

For particles near the SEPR in ϖ, we detect no libration5 thus we show an example
of slow circulation in Fig. 7. When ∆ϖ circulates slowly, the eccentricity varies on the
same timescale while the inclination experiences only short-period oscillations. In essence,
inclination is the quasi-conserved quantity here. In this situation, the test particle cannot
cross the SEPR in ϖ, as is shown in the same ﬁgure. However, though the distance from

the particle to the SEPR remains positive for most of the time, it does become negative for
some time. According to the previous reasoning, the distance should not change its sign
when in circulation. We suggest that, because of the coorbital potential, the SEPR from
Kozai theory does not coincide with the SEPR of the full problem. As will be shown, the
coorbital potential causes a small displacement in the surface. Thus although the distance
in terms of the SEPR in Kozai potential changes the sign, the distance with respect to the
SEPR controlled by both Kozai and coorbital potential does not. See Fig. 9 for the inﬂuence
of coorbital potential on the equilibrium points (i.e., the real SEPR). In Sect. 5 we discuss
the reason why no examples of libration in ∆ϖ are observed here.

3.7 Phase space properties for the three types of resonance

Having established that the three types of resonance exist in the four-dimensional system
(19), we can reduce the system to two dimensions speciﬁcally to study the structure of
individual resonances when the frequencies are well separated. We elaborate our approach
for the nodal resonance and omit the details for the other two cases. Near the SEPR in Ω and
far from the common intersection curve of the four SEPRs, we have d∆Ω /dt (cid:28) d∆ϖ/dt.
At these positions, the effect of the Sun in altering ∆ϖ far outweighs that of the coorbital
interaction. Thus the evolution in ∆ϖ,eP is dominated by the Sun. In addition, under solar
forcing (16), there is only (rapid) precession in ∆ϖ and no evolution in e. Hence, ∆ϖ is now
a “fast” angle (compared to ∆Ω) and eP is constant. To isolate the evolution in (∆Ω ,iP), we
can perform the following averaging

to arrive at a two-dimensional system of (¯hs; ¯Hf) (Cf. Eq. (19)). Here, all effects operating on
timescales shorter than that of nodal libration are removed. We plot the evolution in (∆Ω ,iP)
space in Fig. 8; we elect to show the inclination relative to an empirically-determined value
of 0.22 to highlight the amplitude of the variation. The topological structure of the resonance
is clear: the system has two equilibrium points – a stable one with ∆Ω = π and an unstable
one with ∆Ω = 0; libration around the stable equilibrium point is allowed (which is the
resonance we see). Hence, we suggest that with the coorbital potential, each point in the
SEPR in Kozai potential is split into the two equilibrium points. This can be shown by
setting the variation rates in (20) to be zero. In Fig. 9, we show the positions of the two
stationary points as functions of varying eP. The shift of the equilibrium points from the
SEPR indicates the inﬂuence of the coorbital potential and is of order 10−5, reﬂecting the
weakness of the coorbital interaction compared to the Kozai dynamics.
Using similar techniques, we generate analogous plots for the resonances involving the
angles ∆ω = ∆ (ϖ −Ω ) and ∆ (Ω +ϖ) in Figs. 10 and 11. In dealing with these two types of
resonance, transformations to fully isolate the “slow” evolution are needed. The conserved
quantities in the two-dimensional systems that are the angular momenta conjugate to the
“fast” angles in the four-dimensional systems are

for the resonance in ∆ω and

H∆ (Ω +ϖ) =

for the resonance in ∆ (Ω + ϖ), respectively.

Similar to the concept resonance width, we use the amplitude of the oscillation of incli-
nation near the separatrix between libration and circulation as an indicator of the strength of
the resonance. It is then observed that, the resonance in ∆Ω is the strongest, which may be
the reason why it was the ﬁrst to be identiﬁed (Christou 2005). In Fig. 8, we observe that the
amplitude of the variation of inclination in ∆Ω resonance can be as high as ≈ 0.005. The
strengths of the resonances in ∆ω and ∆ (Ω + ϖ) are similar to each other: the amplitudes
of the oscillation of inclination are (cid:46) 0.001.

Since there is apparently no libration in ∆ϖ in the semianalytical model, the structure
of the phase space for the circulation should be trivial. Hence, we omit its phase diagram.
Similar with the reasoning above, in the case where the slow angle is ∆ϖ, the conserved
quantity is iP.

solve for eP and iP so that, d∆ω/dt = 0 and this is a point on the corresponding SEPR in ω. However, the
solution sometimes does not exist, which is the exact case for the H∆ω prescribed by the elements of Lysithea.
Thus we choose the point in the SEPR with the same semimajor axis and eccentricity as Lysithea. Then we
use the H∆ω of this point for all the trajectories plotted here. Cf. Fig. 5

survive in the full problem. For these reasons we perform extensive N-body simulations6 to
explore the parameter space of the real satellites.

The most important questions we wish to answer here are (i) how well the properties
of these resonances are represented by the semianalytical model and, (ii) the possibility for
a ﬁctitious member of the family to be involved in such resonances. To explore these, an
ensemble of massless test particles are integrated with Jupiter, the Sun and Himalia.

Beaug´e and Nesvorn´y (2007) used the metric

d2 = Ca(∆a/a)2 +Ce(∆e)2 +Ci(∆ sini)2

(23)

to represent the distance from a satellite to the centre of a family in the proper element
space (Ca,Ce and Ci are constant for a speciﬁc irregular satellite family). They proposed
that for the Himalia family, a satellite with d (cid:46) 320 m/s could be regarded as a member7. If
generating test particles with the above criterion only, we produce an ensemble of particles
with the eccentricity in the range (0.03,0.3) and inclination between (23◦,33◦). These are
too large, considering that the corresponding ranges for the real family are about (0.11,0.22)
and (27◦,29◦). To represent better the real family and to enhance the number density of
particles in (a,e,i) space, we further require the eccentricity to be less than 0.1 and the

6 All N-body simulations are implemented with the general Bulirsch-Stoer algorithm in the MERCURY
package (Chambers 1999; Hahn and Malhotra 2005) with a tolerance 10−12. Over an integration time of 108
yr, the errors in energy and angular momentum are both of order 10−10.

7 Note that, when they published the paper, four satellites: Himalia, Elara, Leda and Lysithea were con-
ﬁrmed as group members. The recently recovered ﬁfth member, Dia, has the largest semimajor axis and
eccentricity. Our simple experiments show that the criterion has to be updated to d (cid:46) 510 m/s to include Dia.
In this paper, we stick to the results of Beaug´e and Nesvorn´y (2007).

inclination less than 2◦ from the family mean values; these two values are approximately
twice those of the actual family. We do not apply speciﬁc restrictions on the semimajor
axes as long as they fulﬁl the distance criterion. The ﬁnal distribution of the test particles
is: a ∈ (0.745AU,0.795AU), e ∈ (0.06,0.26) and i ∈ (26◦,30◦). We generate 1000 such
particles. Strictly speaking, the metric is valid for proper elements. We have applied it to
osculating elements for simplicity. The particles, along with Jupiter, Sun and Himalia8, are
integrated for 100 Myr (about 5.3× 107 in our time unit). Our integrations take place in a
jovi-centric reference system. Following Hinse et al. (2010), we have changed the longitudes
of pericentre by adding a π so that, the elements are correct in the jovi-centric frame. The
solar eccentricity e(cid:12) has been set to zero.

Our N-body runs conﬁrm the existence of the resonances in ∆Ω, ∆ω and ∆ (Ω +ϖ) and
discover another one involving the angle ∆ϖ. We present examples of them in the following
subsection. In Subsect. 4.2, a statistical study of the resonances to address question (ii) stated
in the beginning of this section is presented.

4.1 Resonances in N-body simulations

In Fig. 12, we show a typical example of a test particle in (temporary) nodal libration with
Himalia. As in Christou (2005), the quantities e, i are averaged in a ∼ 5× 104 time window
to suppress the short-period oscllations. Some of these ﬂuctuations come from the Kozai
cycle.

The N-body simulations agree well with the semianalytical model in reproducing the
general features of the nodal resonance, e.g., the centre and period of libration in ∆Ω =

ΩP − ΩH (π and 106 respectively), the corresponding oscillation in inclination and the fail-
ure of the resonance to excite the eccentricity. Inspecting the example in Fig. 12 in detail, it
is found that, when the signed distance to the SEPR in (a,e,i) space, measured in ∆i (top
panel, the solid curve), is around the peak, ∆Ω increases and when ∆i is near the trough,
∆Ω decreases. This is consistent with the semianalytical example (Fig. 3) in the sense that
when the particle moves above the SEPR with higher inclination, it has higher nodal pre-
cession rate than Himalia (while its absolute value is lower since the rate is negative), and
vice versa; as ∆Ω approaches zero, the particle is pushed to cross the surface, causing the
libration. However, in this example, the distance does not oscillate exactly around zero, but
slightly below it. We suggest, this is because of the simpliﬁcations we made in Sect. 3.3 in
constructing the semianalytical model and especially, in calculating the SEPR; in the full
problem, such oscillations should be about zero. Alternatively, if we use the ﬁt to the data
from the N-body simulations (see Subsect. 4.2 and particularly, Eq. (27) and Fig. 19), the
result turns out to be better. When in libration, the distance ∆i (the dashed curve in the top
panel) does oscillate around zero. Also apparent is that, before about 1.4× 107, the distance
remains smaller than zero and ∆Ω keeps decreasing; then from roughly 1.9×107, the angle,
after passage through libration, becomes increasing, with the distance above zero.

time in our adopted unit. It is evident that, when in libration, i (but not e) is modulated on a timescale of
106. The distance ∆i has the same meaning as in Fig. 3: the solid curve is the distance to the SEPR from
semianalytical model (11); the dashed one is related to the ﬁtted surface (Cf. Eq. (27) and Fig. 19); the
horizontal dotted line marks a value of zero for ∆i

In Fig. 13 we show an example of the resonance in ∆ω = ∆ (ϖ −Ω ) = ωP−ωH. As ob-
served by our integrations of the semianalytical model (Fig. 5), the angle ∆ω librates around
π. The variation of the eccentricity and inclination is anti-correlated. This is reminiscent of
the Kozai cycle.

correlated: maxima (or minima) of e and i occur at the same time. Interestingly, for this
particular example, the rate of circulation of the angle ∆ω is not much faster than that of

appear superposed on the long-period correlated evolution. We believe that such short-period
effects are related to the circulation of ∆ω. Since the resonances are so close together in
(a,e,i) space (see Figs. 4 and 19), it is not surprising such slow circulation of an angle exists
inside the libration region of another angle.

Apart from the three types of resonance that appear in the semianalytical model and
conﬁrmed by our N-body runs here, we observe another type involving the angle ∆ϖ =
ϖP − ϖH. We illustrate it with an example in Fig. 15. The resonance in this angle seems to
be the weakest as the resonant angle and action do not behave as regular as those in other
three resonances. For the resonance in ∆ϖ, we expect that, while the inclination remains
nearly constant on the long term, the eccentricity oscillates periodically in accordance with
the libration in ∆ϖ. However, the resonance appears to be highly unstable in the sense that,
(i) the libration in ∆ϖ is intermittent and that (ii) the oscillation of eccentricity does not
correlate well with the variation of the angle. In Sect. 5, we will further explain this. The
libration in ∆ϖ will be referred to as “apsidal libration” or “apsidal resonance” thereafter.

4.2 Statistics of the N-body simulations

Using the high number of libration episodes observed in our simulations, we can draw some
statistical conclusions.
Out of the 1000 test particles, 37 are found to be in nodal resonance for longer than about
106 (by visual inspection); among those 37, 32 show libration for time spans (cid:38) 3× 106. A
duration of 106 corresponds to approximately two cycles of the nodal libration.

To identify episodes of libration automatically in the time series, we implement two
different approaches. The ﬁrst approach uses the discrete Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
algorithm in the package “Fastest Fourier Transform in the West” (Frigo and Johnson 2005)
to extract the periods and amplitudes of the periodic terms in the time series for ∆Ω and i;

where P(x) is the strength at period x, A a scaling factor, µ0 the centre of the normal distri-
bution and σ0 its dispersion. Taking the logarithm of both sides, we have

logP(x) = logA− (x− µ0)2
2σ 2

.

(25)

We ﬁt this quadratic function to the data to extract the strongest period µ0 and its strength
P(µ0). We have tried Gaussian ﬁtting of the deﬁned original strength and it often does not
converge. To improve the procedure, we instead weigh our data in an iterative process. The
weight is designed so that, points with periods closer to µ0 and/or with larger strength P are
more important; the weight function is

Wn =

1 + (Pn/ ¯P)M
1 +|xn − µ0|/∆x ,

(26)

in which (xn,Pn) is a (period, strength) combination from the FFT analysis, Wn its weight, ¯P
the mean strength of all periods, ∆x the total coverage in period and M a free parameter that
controls the importance of the periods with different strength P. The value of µ0 is updated
after each iteration. This process continues until either µ0 and P(µ0) converge or do not.
The analysis of inclination is complicated as it often shows multiple local extrema. Thus
for inclination, if M is too large, µ0 and P(µ0) can converge towards a local extremum. For
∆Ω, the ﬂuctuation is smaller, and a larger M allows us to achieve a better estimate of the
strongest period. From experiments, we choose M = 20 for ∆Ω and 4 for i; we use (xn,Pn)
only when xn ∈ (3× 105,9× 105) to reduce the inﬂuences of irrelevant periods. In addition,
we apply the criterion that if the ﬁtted P(µ0) is too small, we do not recognise the peak as
real. In this way, we can identify all the 32 resonant particles with total time in libration
≥ 3× 106, without any false positives.
Shown in Fig. 16 is the FFT analysis and the ﬁtting results of the same test particle
as in Fig. 12. Out of the entire integration time of 5.3× 107, the total duration in libration
is roughly 7 × 106. This is (7 × 106)/(5.3 × 107) ≈ 0.13 of the entire integration and it
generates a strong enough signature in FFT analysis that enables us to detect the libration.
The period of nodal libration from the ﬁt is 5.31× 105 for this particle whereas the average
period of the 32 cases is 5.73× 105. As stated above, the determination of libration period
in terms of ∆Ω is more reliable owing to the higher value of M in the weight function (26);
the two periods are from the analysis of ∆Ω.

However, the method described above does not work well for the resonances in ∆ω,
∆ (Ω +ϖ) and ∆ϖ. We suggest this issue mainly results from the different behaviour of the
resonances. For instance, in Fig. 14 for the resonance involving ∆ (Ω + ϖ), we see that the
behaviour in the time range (3.1×107,3.25×107) and in (3.36×107,3.5×107) are visually
different. Indeed, in the former, the particle is closer to the separatrix with larger amplitude
and longer period compared to the latter one where the particle is near the libration centre.
In nodal libration, the librator tends to stay near the separatrix (see Fig. 12); this may help
to generate strong FFT signals9. Also these resonances are weaker with smaller amplitudes
in the oscillations of e and/or i compared to the nodal resonance. These two factors may
cause the failure of the above method to identify these episodes of libration for the three
resonances.

To provide a universal approach valid for all the resonances, we introduce the following

method which detects libration depending on the behaviour of the angles only.

9 The particle in Fig. 18 described below is not a typical example: for a librator to be stable for 5.3× 107,

it has to lie well within the resonance. Most librators only pass through libration.

y-axis: the FFT algorithm generated strength (point, blue) and ﬁtted strength (dashed curve, blue) for i; x-axis:
period. This is the analysis of the same particle as in Fig. 12

The basic idea is that principally, when an angle is in libration, it cannot cross the point
that is π away from the libration centre and it must cross the libration centre regularly. For
instance, in the case of nodal libration (i.e., when the libration centre is π), the angle ∆Ω
should not cross 0 and it is supposed to cross π periodically. If this state of affairs persists,
we recognise it as a libration event. Additionally, we require the frequency of crossing the
libration centre and the rate of the librating angle to be within plausible ranges. Therefore,
the addition of these ﬁlters reduces signiﬁcantly the number of false positives. In testing the
method for nodal libration, we empirically choose the parameters so that it retrieves all the
32 librators found by the FFT-based method and without false positives. In this respect, the
two methods are mutually consistent.

With this method, we ﬁnd 32, 29, 19 and 11 particles in resonances involving ∆Ω, ∆ω,

∆ (Ω + ϖ) and ∆ϖ, respectively.

In the N-body simulations, the evolution of eccentricity and inclination often experi-
ences irregular short-period variations. It is then difﬁcult to estimate the strengths of the
resonances in terms of the amplitudes of the actions. Instead, we use the term “stability” to
describe the resonances in real N-body simulations. We deﬁne stability as the longest du-
ration of a single libration event from within the set of all such events. We extract the time
duration for each libration event of the four resonances; we plot the distribution of durations
of all such events in Fig. 17. The nodal resonance is the most stable, as it can lock a test
particle in libration for (cid:29) 107. Actually, we even have two particles remaining in libration
for the entire integration of ≈ 5.3× 107; see Fig. 18. The resonances in ∆ω and ∆ (Ω + ϖ)
are similarly stable; both can stay in libration for up to ≈ 107. The resonance in ∆ϖ is the
least stable: the libration cannot survive longer than ≈ 5.6×106. These results correlate with
the strength estimates in Subsect. 3.7: the resonance with the largest amplitude is the most
stable.

We compute the mean orbital elements of a librator when inside resonance and plot
them in Fig. 19. We only use the averaged elements inside the libration, since as noted by
Christou (2005), the elements may experience sudden changes in entering and/or leaving
libration (e.g., Figs. 14 and 21). In the same ﬁgure, we show the following quadratic ﬁt for
each type of the resonances:

in which the A j, j = 1, . . . ,5, are the coefﬁcients to be determined. These surfaces can be
regarded as the SEPRs in the full problem since they originate from N-body simulations.
Comparing them with the surfaces from semianalytical theory in Fig. 4, we ﬁnd that the
semianalytical model reproduces the relative positions and the overall slopes and shapes of
the surfaces fairly well. The main reason for the differences between the two models for
large inclination is that, the oscillation of eccentricity inside a Kozai cycle is not small here,
contrary to our assumption of small variation of eccentricity in deriving Eq. (11). The ﬁtted
surface for Ω has been used to plot the distance to the SEPR in Fig. 12 (top panel, dashed

(a,e,i) space in comparison with all integrated particles and with the real family members. The big round
points with different colours represent the librators of the four types. The surfaces with corresponding colours
are the ﬁtted SEPRs. The small grey points are the 1000 test particles. The unﬁlled square, circle, triangle and
diamond represent Dia, Elara, Leda and Lysithea, respectively. The black square is Himalia, again

To better highlight the positions of the resonant particles with respect to the SEPRs,
we perform another set of simulations with 2× 400 test particles. The generation of initial
conditions is, by and large, the same as the previous simulations except that here the initial
osculating semimajor axes only assume one of the two values a1 = 0.98 and a2 = 1.02 times
the family mean semimajor axis. Then we plot the averaged e and i of the librators found
in these 2 × 400 particles in the (e,i) plane and compare them with the positions of the
curves of equal precession rate (the intersections of the SEPRs with the a = a1 and a = a2
planes) in Fig. 20. Again, the curves of equal precession rate from semianalytical model
(solid curves) agree with those from the ﬁt (dashed curves). Note that, although the initial
osculating semimajor axes are uniquely deﬁned, they can vary signiﬁcantly over the course
of the simulations; thus the mean a could be different from a1 and a2. This explains the
excursion of a point from its corresponding ﬁtted curve. For example, in the lower panel, the
semimajor axis of the curves is exactly a1 while for the points, the semimajor axes may be
slightly different.

With the 1000 and 2×400 test particles, we have 54, 52, 38 and 28 in resonances of ∆Ω,
∆ω, ∆ (Ω + ϖ) and ∆ϖ. They are all considered in ﬁtting (27) while in Figs. 17 and 19,
only the 1000 particle integration results are plotted. We have visually checked these code
detected librators and conﬁrm that they are actual librators. However, since our method is
insensitive to short duration libration events, more short-lived librators are likely.

As noted in Christou (2005), it was possible that the nodal resonant passage had a net ef-
fect in the sense that the inclination, after the libration passage, could change ∼ 0.1◦, mostly
increasing. In our simulations, we have conﬁrmed the changes of similar amplitude; we ﬁnd
both directions are possible. Here, we show an example in Fig. 21. These resonance-induced
changes and the cumulative long-term consequences will be addressed in a forthcoming pa-
per.

5 Conclusion and discussion

We have investigated the dynamics of the Himalia irregular satellite group in a restricted
four-body problem scheme where Jupiter, Sun and the satellite Himalia have ﬁnite masses
while the test particle, representing a ﬁctitious group member, is massless. We combine the
Kozai with coorbital theories to construct a uniﬁed semianalytical model; the “fast” effects
(operating on timescales comparable to that of a Kozai cycle) are removed. Then we arrive

at a “slow” four-dimensional system. In this system, we are able to reproduce the main
characteristics of a libration in ∆Ω ﬁrst observed in the numerical simulations in Christou
(2005). We also identify two additional types of resonance involving the angles ∆ω and
∆ (Ω + ϖ); their locations in phase space can be approximated by the surfaces of equal
precession rate (SEPRs). In reducing the systems to two-dimensional ones, we determine
the phase space structure for each of the three resonances. Using numerical integrations of
the full Newtonian equations of motion, we conﬁrm the results of the semianalytical model
regarding the three types of resonance and ﬁnd a fourth type involving ∆ϖ. We analyse the
occurrence rate and stability of these resonances in the N-body simulations. The libration
periods of these four resonances are all of order 106; speciﬁcally, the FFT-based mean period
of nodal resonance is 5.73× 105 (∼ 1.08 Myr). The main properties of the resonances are
listed in Table 1.

In the semianalytical approach, the “evection” terms (Yokoyama et al. 2008; see also
Sect. 1) that relate the mean motion of the Sun with the apsidal rate of the satellite are
omitted. The evection effect can be important for satellites far from the planet (a (cid:38) rH/2; rH
is the Hill radius of the planet) where the precession rate is fast. In the planar prograde case,
the evection potential to the lowest order in α has the form (Frouard et al. 2010)

Revec ∼ m(cid:12)α3
a(cid:12)

e2 cos(2ϖ − 2λ(cid:12)),

(28)

where λ(cid:12) is the Solar mean longitude. We have implemented the evection corrections as
proposed in Cuk and Burns (2004) and found that it does not improve the precision of our
model signiﬁcantly. To be exact, with the corrections, we are still unable to approximate the
nodal rate accurately enough to locate the position of the SEPR (in the full N-body model).
Thus the evection correction is dropped. In addition, though the octupole solar perturbation
potential is zero owing to the circular orbit assumed for the Sun (e.g., Krymolowski and
Mazeh 1999), even higher order terms may contribute to the precession of the node and
shift the location of resonance slightly. Regarding our simple way in removing ω in Eq. (4)
and in reaching Eq. (11), there are semianalytical methods for this purpose (Henrard 1990).
But that approach requires the introduction of new variables that have no apparent physical
meaning, which we believe will complicate the interpretation of the results.

Our semianalytical model does not reproduce the apsidal resonance in ∆ϖ. The original
Kozai potential (4) is dependent on e only to order 2 but on i to higher orders (through
cosi) while in the coorbital potential (Eqs. (6) and (7)), e and i are symmetric. Thus this
shortcoming of the semianalytical model results from the Kozai potential, speciﬁcally the
truncated form of the solar forcing. The lack of higher order terms in e causes the absence

Secular Resonances Between Bodies on Close Orbits

27

of ¯G2 in the ﬁnal Kozai potential (14) while ¯H2 does exist. Thus after partial differentiation,
the rate ˙¯g does not depend on its conjugate angular momentum ¯G but ˙¯h does depend on ¯H.
Hence we suggest that, the Kozai potential not only gives rise to the SEPRs, it must also
play an important role in modulating ˙¯h (thus d∆Ω /dt) through ¯H. Therefore, terms like ¯G2
in the solar perturbation is needed for the apsidal libration, which is only possible in higher
order terms in α = a/a(cid:12). Indeed, if we artiﬁcially add a term ¯G2 in the Kozai potential,
the resonance in ∆ϖ can be retrieved in the semianalytical model. We believe this is why
we do not observe apsidal libration in the semianalytical model while it does appear in the
N-body simulations. This is probably why the apsidal resonance is the most unstable and
the weakest (see Figs. 15 and 17).

Although our semianalytical model is truncated in e and i, we test it with real Himalia
group inclinations (≈ 0.5) and ﬁnd that, the model does reproduce the three resonances at
these inclinations. However, by dividing the real inclinations by a factor of 3, the e and i
are similarly small and more consistent with the assumptions made in deriving the coorbital
interaction potential (6) (H´enon and Petit 1986; Namouni 1999).

We have simpliﬁed the problem to a restricted four-body problem model. In reality,
perturbations such as the oblateness of Jupiter and the effects of other planets exist. When
these additional factors are considered, we suggest these resonances may still persist. In our
analysis, the solar perturbation mainly arrests relative precession and makes the resonances
possible, though terms like ¯H2 do contribute directly to give rise to the resonances. On
the timescales we are interested in, it has been simpliﬁed in the form (14) containing no
angles. When a more elaborate model is constructed, probably similar simpliﬁcations can
be made and small changes in the resonance locations (in the form of the SEPRs) will likely
occur. In Christou (2005), Saturn and the jovian oblateness were taken into account and in
such a conﬁguration, he found the resonance in ∆Ω. Including other planets may introduce
additional dynamical effects such as secular resonances (see, e.g., Beaug´e and Nesvorn´y
2007; Frouard et al. 2011).

Similar to high order mean motion resonance (Moons 1997) and secular resonance (Bot-
tke et al. 2001), resonances involving other combinations of ∆Ω and ∆ϖ may exist. They
may be weaker and less stable, compared to the resonances described in this paper.

As shown in Figs. 4 and 19, the SEPRs are close together to each other, especially near
the massive satellite. Consequently, the resonances may interact with each other and give
rise to chaos; e.g., Fig. 14. Considering that Himalia may give other group members random
kicks during close encounters, it is not strange that a test particle may pass through more
than one type of resonance if we extend the N-body simulations long enough. Actually, in
our 100 Myr integration, we observe an example transiting from libration in ∆ϖ to libration
in ∆ (Ω + ϖ).

Considering that the retrograde irregular satellite groups are more prevalent in the solar
system and that, they often have a much more massive member, the resonances explored
in this paper for prograde satellites may have their counterparts in the retrograde case. For
example, the Ananke and Carme groups of Jupiter have inclinations around 150◦ and 165◦,
respectively. However, the most massive members in the two groups are only 0.004 and 0.02
of the mass of Himalia (mH) and this is possibly too small to allow resonance phenomena
to exist. As an experiment, we have run N-body simulations to test if a prograde massive
satellite of 0.01mH can induce nodal resonance and the results is positive – such low masses
may work. As the cases of evection phenomenon (described in Sect. 1), the deﬁnition of
ϖ becomes the difference between Ω and ω for retrograde orbits; it is possible that the

28

structure of the retrograde resonances is different, for instance, the libration centre may
change. For the masses and orbital elements mentioned here, see footnote 1.

Recently, Novakovi´c et al. (2015) reported a nodal resonance similar to the one discussed
here. Their resonance is due to Ceres and could be responsible for the inclination dispersion
in the Hoffmeister asteroid family. In their case, the main perturbation comes from Jupiter
and the mass ratio between Ceres and Jupiter is of order 10−7; in our situation, the mass
ratio mH/m(cid:12) is 10−12, arguably a more extreme case. Due to the similar nature of the two
problems, we suggest that other types of resonance (e.g., the one involving ∆ω) may exist
in the asteroid belt.

Finally, in Fig. 19 we see that, Dia, Elara and Leda are near the SEPR in (Ω +ϖ) while
Lysithea is close to the surface in Ω. To check whether the real satellites could be affected by
the resonances, we perform an additional integration using the orbits of the real moons for
1000 Myr. We ﬁnd that, Leda does enter the resonance in ∆ (Ω + ϖ). Thus some members
of the actual family may have been affected by these resonances. This will be addressed in
a future paper.

Appendix A Derivation of the “averaged” Kozai Hamiltonian

We derive the Kozai Hamiltonian (11) from its original form (4) here. First, we substitute
e and i in Eq. (4) in terms of the angular momenta G and H. Then we solve for G so
G = G(F,H,ω,const.), where const. refers to combinations of k, m(cid:12), a and a(cid:12). Note that in
this expression, F, H and const. are all constant and only ω and G are variable. Furthermore,
it can be shown with this equation that the variation in eccentricity during a Kozai cycle, ∆e2
is a small quantity (e.g., for Himalia’s nominal orbit, ∆e2 (cid:46) 0.03). Therefore, we assume that
the angular momentum G ∝

√
1− e2 can be expressed as

G2 = b0 + b1 cos2ω + . . . ,

(29)
where the coefﬁcients b1 (cid:28) b0. We can then express b0 and b1 as functions of F, H and
const. by comparing the above equation with G = G(F,H,ω,const.). Now, if we further
omit the term b1 cos2ω we have

G2 = b0 = b0(F,H,const.) ∝ 1−(cid:104)e(cid:105)2 .

(30)

Here, (cid:104)e(cid:105) is not the e in the original Hamiltonian (4) but the averaged e over a Kozai cycle.
Meanwhile, we also have H2 ∝ (1−(cid:104)e(cid:105)2)cos2(cid:104)i(cid:105) and (cid:104)i(cid:105) is the averaged i. Then we solve
Eq. (30) for F. So now F is a function of H, b0 = G2 and const.. After substituting (cid:104)e(cid:105) and
(cid:104)i(cid:105) into it, we arrive at the “averaged” Kozai Hamiltonian (11). The new eccentricity and
inclination are constant under the solar forcing; for simplicity, we still use the old notations
e and i.

Appendix B The non-canonical property of coorbital potential

As stated in Subsect. 3.3, the coorbital potential (6) (and hence (17)) is not canonical in
the variables used in Eq. (16). To prove this, we presume it is canonical and introduce the
following canonical transformations. For the ﬁrst transformation, we name the variables on
the left side as “absolute Cartesian” variables.

2 ¯GH sin ¯gH,

(cid:112)
(cid:112)2 ¯HH sin ¯hH,
(cid:112)
(cid:112)2 ¯HP sin ¯hP,

2 ¯GP sin ¯gP,

¯Gx,H =
¯Hx,H =
¯Gx,P =
¯Hx,P =

2 ¯GH cos ¯gH;

(cid:112)
(cid:112)2 ¯HH cos ¯hH;
(cid:112)
(cid:112)2 ¯HP cos ¯hP.

2 ¯GP cos ¯gP;

¯Gy,H =
¯Hy,H =
¯Gy,P =
¯Hy,P =

(31)

(32)

On the right-hand sides of the above expressions, ( ¯g, ¯G) and (¯h, ¯H) are conjugate Poincar´e
variables with subscripts “H” and “P” referring to Himalia and a particle, respectively. Then
another transformation is introduced. The variables on the left are referred to as “relative
Cartesian” variables.

√
√
2 + ¯Gy,H/
¯Gy,t = ¯Gy,P/
2,
√
√
¯Hy,t = ¯Hy,P/
2 + ¯Hy,H/
2,
√
√
2− ¯Gy,H/
¯Gy,r = ¯Gy,P/
2,
√
√
2− ¯Hy,H/
¯Hy,r = ¯Hy,P/
2,

√
√
2 + ¯Gx,H/
¯Gx,t = ¯Gx,P/
2;
√
√
2 + ¯Hx,H/
¯Hx,t = ¯Hx,P/
2;
√
√
2− ¯Gx,H/
¯Gx,r = ¯Gx,P/
2;
√
√
2− ¯Hx,H/
¯Hx,r = ¯Hx,P/
2.

This relates the variables with subscript “r” to the variables used in the coorbital theory as
given by Namouni (1999); see the paragraph containing Eqs. (6)-(9).

Now note that, since we assume the coorbital potential is canonical in the original
Poincar´e variables, it should preserve the Hamiltonian property in the variables above. How-
ever, since the coorbital potential contains only the relative elements, i.e., in the relative
Cartesian variables, it only depends on the variables with subscript “r”. Hence, if we consider
√
√
the Jupiter-Himalia-particle system. The quantities with subscript “t” will be conserved.
However, this is not possible. Taking ¯Gy,t = ¯Gy,P/
2 + ¯Gy,H/
2 for instance. Since the test
√
particle is massless, it should have no inﬂuence on Himalia and thus the second term on the
right hand side ¯Gy,H/
2 is constant. From the above reasoning, we know that, ¯Gy,t should
√
be conserved. This means that, the ﬁrst term on the right hand side, ¯Gy,P/
2 =

(cid:112) ¯GP sin ¯gP
will no change. Similarly,(cid:112) ¯GP cos ¯gP,(cid:112) ¯HP sin ¯hP and(cid:112) ¯HP cos ¯hP should all be constant.

If so, the orbital elements of the particle are not evolving under the perturbation of Himalia.
Of course this is not true – the coorbital potential is not a Hamiltonian in the variables used
here.

However, the level-curve like structure in the phase diagrams Figs. 8, 10 and 11 of
the three types of resonance suggests the existence of a conserved quantity (a Hamilto-
nian) for these two-dimensional systems. We have tried to construct one of the form of
FT = FS + A× RS (see Eqs. (16) and (17)), where A is a constant depending on some non-
changing parameters. For instance, for the case of nodal resonance, A could be a function
of the masses, the semimajor axes and the eccentricities (but not a function of inclinations).
However, the solution for A seems to be nonexistent (at least for the nodal resonance). Thus
we argue that, the conserved quantity of the two-dimensional systems might be of more
complicated forms.
