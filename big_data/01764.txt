singularity from GFT condensates

We study the expansion of the Universe using an eﬀective Friedmann equation obtained from the
dynamics of GFT isotropic condensates. A promising feature of this model is the occurrence of an
era of accelerated expansion, without the need to introduce an inﬂaton ﬁeld with an appropriately
chosen potential. Although the evolution equations are “classical”, the cosmological model is entirely
quantum and does not admit a description in terms of a classical spacetime. Consistency with
Riemannian geometry holds only at late times, when standard cosmology is recovered. Hence the
dynamics is given in purely relational terms. An eﬀective gravitational constant is seen to arise from
the collective behaviour of spacetime quanta, as described by GFT. The occurrence of a bounce,
which resolves the initial spacetime singularity, is shown to be a general property of the model.

Inﬂation, despite its undoubtful success in explaining
cosmological data and the numerous models studied in
the literature, still remains a paradigm in search of a
theory. The inﬂationary era should have occured at the
very early stages of our Universe, however the inﬂation-
ary dynamics are commonly studied in the context of
Einstein’s classical gravity and assuming the existence of
a classical scalar ﬁeld with a particularly tuned potential.
Clearly, the onset of inﬂation [1, 2] and the inﬂationary
dynamics must be addressed within a quantum gravity
proposal.
In this letter, employing results from Group
Field Theory [3] (GFT), we attempt to bridge the gap
between the quantum gravity era and the standard clas-
sical cosmological model. In particular, in the context of
GFT we propose a model that can account for an early
accelerated expansion of our Universe in the absence of
an inﬂaton ﬁeld. We hence show that modiﬁcations in
the gravitational sector of the theory can account for its
early stage dynamics. Indeed, it is reasonable to expect
that quantum gravity corrections at very early times –
when geometry, space and time lose the meaning we are
familiar with – may eﬀectively lead to the same dynamics
as the introduction of a hypothetical inﬂaton ﬁeld with
a suitable potential to satisfy cosmological data.

Group Field Theory is a non-perturbative and back-
ground independent approach to quantum gravity.
In
GFT, the fundamental degrees of freedom of quantum
space are associated to graphs labelled by algebraic data
of group theoretic nature. The quantum spacetime is
seen as a superposition of discrete quantum spaces, each
one generated through an interaction of fundamental
building blocks (called “quanta of geometry”), typically
considered as tetrahedra. In the continium classical limit,
one then expects to recover the standard dynamics of
General Relativity. In this sense, the notion of spacetime
geometry, gravity and time can be seen as emergent phe-
nomena. Group Field Theory cosmology is built upon

the existence of a condensate state of GFT quanta, in-
terpreted macroscopically as a homogeneous universe.

In Ref. [4] an eﬀective Friedmann equation was ob-
tained from the dynamics of a GFT condensate. The
condensate wave function can be written as σj = ρjeiθj ,
where j is a representation index. Evolution is purely
relational, thus all dynamical quantities are regarded as
functions of a massless scalar ﬁeld φ. Derivatives with
respect to φ will be denoted by a prime. There is a con-
served charge associated to θj:

The dynamics of macroscopic observables is deﬁned
through that of the expectation values of the correspond-
ing quantum operators. In GFT, as in Loop Quantum
Gravity, the fundamental observables are geometric op-
erators, such as areas and volumes. The volume of space
at a given value of relational time φ, is thus obtained
from the condensate wave function as

where Vj ∝ j3/2(cid:96)P l is the eigenvalue of the volume op-
erator corresponding to a given representation j. Using
this as a deﬁnition and diﬀerentiating w.r.t. relational
time φ one obtains, as in Ref. [4] the following equations,
which play the rˆole of eﬀective Friedmann (and accelera-
tion) equations describing the dynamics of the cosmos as
it arises from that of a condensate of spacetime quanta

Notice that these equations are written in terms of func-
tions of φ. In fact, as implied by the background inde-
pendence of GFT, and more in general of any theory of
quantum geometry, a priori there is no spacetime and
therefore no way of selecting a coordinate time. In par-
ticular, it is not possible to write the evolution equations
in terms of proper time, as it is customary for classical
homogeneous and isotropic models. In the following we
will restrict our attention to the case in which the con-
densate belongs to one particular representation of the
symmetry group. This special case can be obtained from
the equations written above by considering a condensate
wave function σj with support only on j = j0. Repre-
sentation indices will hereafter be omitted. Hence, we

As φ → ±∞, g(φ) →
m2 and the standard Friedmann
and acceleration equations are recovered. In that limit a
classical spacetime emerges and it is possible to introduce
the proper time. We can therefore write the evolution
equation of the Universe in the classical limit of GFT in
the form of an eﬀective Friedmann equation (H = ˙V

This equation should reduce to the conventional Fried-
mann equation in the large φ limit

(14)

Thus, consistency in the limit demands m2 = 3πG, which
put some constraints on the parameters of the micro-
scopic model based on its macroscopic limit (see Ref. [4]).
We would like to remark at this point why one cannot
take seriously the description of the dynamics given by
Eq. (14) and the classical conservation law πφ = ˙φV at
ﬁnite values of the scalar ﬁeld φ. In fact it is not possi-
ble to allow for a dynamical gravitational constant while
conserving energy-momentum. The two requirements are
incompatible because of the Bianchi identities. The only
possibility to go around this problem is to have an extra
dynamical source of energy-momentum, e.g. a time de-
pendent dark energy term as in Refs. [5],[6]. The Bianchi
identities are non-dynamical equations which necessar-
ily follow from the description of the gravitational ﬁeld
as the curvature of spacetime:
the failure to satisfy
them merely means that there is no spacetime altogether.
Therefore, the one discussed in this paper is a cosmolog-
ical model that makes no reference to spacetime. The
latter emerges just at inﬁnite (relational) time.

Let us discuss in more detail the properties of the
model at ﬁnite (relational) times. Eq. (11) predicts a
bounce when g(φ) vanishes. We denote by Φ the “in-
stant” when the bounce takes place. One can therefore
eliminate the integration constant b in favour of Φ

This is to be contrasted with classical cosmology (14),
where the rate of expansion is zero when the energy den-
sity vanishes.

It is possible to express the condition that the Universe
has a positive acceleration in purely relational terms. In
fact this very notion requires the existence of proper time
for its deﬁnition. In the standard cosmology it is sensible
to introduce the proper time t and the scale factor a,
related to the volume by the relation V = a3. Hence one

singularity in both cases.The origin in the plots correponds
to the bounce, occuring at φ = Φ. The asymptotic value for
large φ is the same in both cases and coincides with Newton’s
constant. In the case E < 0 this limit is also a supremum,
whereas in the E > 0 case Gef f has two maxima, equally
distant from the bounce, and approaches Newton’s constant
from above.

Clearly, the singularity is always avoided for E < 0 and,
provided Q (cid:54)= 0, it is also avoided in the case E > 0.
Moreover, if the GFT energy is negative, the energy den-
sity has a vanishing limit at the bounce for vanishing Q:

εmax = 0, E < 0.

The two conditions are obviously equivalent for large φ.
However, the second one has a wider range of applicabil-
ity, since it is physically meaningful also when there is
no classical spacetime and no sensible notion of proper
time can be introduced. Making use of Eq. (11) the last
condition can be rewritten as

(24)

This is satisﬁed trivially in a neighbourhood of the
bounce since g vanishes there and the l.h.s. of the in-
equality is strictly positive, see Figs. 3,4.
It is instead
violated at inﬁnity, consistently with a decelerating Uni-
verse in the classical regime.

OUTLOOK AND CONCLUSIONS

We studied the properties of a model of quantum cos-
mology obtained in Ref. [4] in the hydrodynamic limit
of GFT. We have shown that this model does not corre-
spond to the evolution of a classical spacetime. Therefore
it is not possible to talk about evolution with respect to
a time coordinate, instead evolution must be deﬁned in
a relational sense. In order to do this, we use a massless
scalar ﬁeld as a clock. The classical picture is recovered
in the limit of large times.

Therefore in this limiting case the energy density is zero
at all times. Nevertheless, the Universe will still expand

The main results of this work are two. First we have
shown that there is a bounce, taking place regardless of

-4-224ϕ0.20.40.60.81.0Geff-4-224ϕ0.20.40.60.81.01.21.4Geff4

The second result is the occurence of an era of ac-
celerated expansion without the need for introducing ad
hoc potentials and initial conditions for a scalar ﬁeld.
The picture given could replace the inﬂationary scenario.
Since it is an inherently quantum description of cosmol-
ogy, it does not share the unsatisfactory features of inﬂa-
tionary models, which were spelled out in the introduc-
tion.

The novel feature of this model, namely its incom-
patibility with Riemannian geometry, opens a window
towards understanding how to bridge the gap between
quantum geometry and the classical macroscopic world
as described by general relativity. It also creates more
perspectives from the GFT side, since after the phase
transition that gives rise to the condensate of spacetime
quanta, there must be yet another phase transition from
a pre-geometric phase, where the geometric properties of
the Universe, e.g. the volume, cannot be obtained from a
metric, to a properly called geometric phase. The model
we considered incidentally gives a phenomenological de-
scription of this phase transition below the critical point.
The properties of the phase transition of course are not
fully captured since it takes place as φ → ±∞.

Yet another interesting result is that, even though
Newton’s constant is related to, and actually constrains,
the parameter of the microscopic GFT theory (as shown
in [4]), the dynamics of the expansion of the Universe
is actually determined by the eﬀective gravitational con-
stant, which is instead determined by the collective be-
haviour of spacetime quanta. This would possibly shed
some light on the nature of the gravitational constant and
whether it actually deserves the status of being a funda-
mental constant, along with the possibility of measuring
its time variation.

Universe is undergoing an epoch of accelerated expansion fol-
lowing the bounce. Figure 3 corresponds to the case E < 0,
whereas Fig. 4 is relative to the opposite case E > 0. Notice
that for the latter there is a stage of maximal deceleration af-

It should be pointed out that the nature of this bounce is
quite diﬀerent as the one given by Loop Quantum Cos-
mology [7].
In fact in that case, the dynamics of the
cosmological background is governed by eﬀective equa-
tions which are still compatible with the principles of Rie-
mannian geometry. Only the sources appear eﬀectively
coupled in a diﬀerent way, which is however still compat-
ible with the Bianchi identities. In our case the Bianchi
identities are violated, which implies that the model is
kinematically incompatible with Riemannian geometry.
