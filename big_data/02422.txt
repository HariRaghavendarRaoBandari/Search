Weak convergence of Galerkin approximations of
stochastic partial diﬀerential equations driven by

additive L´evy noise

Abstract

This work considers weak approximations of stochastic partial diﬀerential equa-
tions (SPDEs) driven by L´evy noise. The SPDEs at hand are parabolic with ad-
ditive noise processes. A weak-convergence rate for the corresponding Galerkin
approximation is derived. The convergence result is derived by use of the Malli-
avin derivative rather then the common approach via the Kolmogorov backward
equation.

Keywords: Weak convergence, stochastic partial diﬀerential equation, L´evy
noise, Malliavin calculus

1. Introduction

In contrast to partial diﬀerential equations, the error analysis of approxima-
tions of solutions to stochastic (partial) diﬀerential equations (SPDEs) allows
for two conceptually diﬀerent approaches: weak and strong. Both of these kinds
of error analysis for SPDEs have been actively researched during the last two
decades. While the strong (or pathwise) error has been the subject of a vast
array of publications, the weak error, which is computed in terms of moments
of the solution process, has, to the date, garnered considerably less attention.

In this paper we consider weak-convergence rates of Galerkin approximations
of solutions to the parabolic stochastic partial diﬀerential equation given, for
t ∈ (0, T ] =: T, by

By H we denote a separable Hilbert space, A is a linear operator on H, f maps
T into H and G is a mapping from T into the linear, bounded operators form
some separable Hilbert space U (not necessarily equal to H) into H. Further,
L denotes a L´evy process deﬁned on the complete probability space (Ω, F , )
and it takes values in U .

For solutions to SPDEs like Equation (1), the strong-error rate of Galerkin
approximations has been considered, among others, in [3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 13, 14, 15,
17, 19, 20, 23]. In these references, SPDEs driven by either Gaussian or L´evy
noises are treated. Publications on weak approximations and their error analysis
are, among others, [1, 2, 5, 8, 10, 12, 16, 18, 21, 22], where, to a great extent,
SPDEs driven by Gaussian processes are considered.

In this paper, we consider an equivalent approach as in [22] and combine it
with the recent results on Malliavin calculus for L´evy driven SPDEs in [11]. In
our main result, Theorem 3.4, we show that the weak-convergence rate is twice
the strong-convergence rate. This is akin to the ﬁndings in [21], where a similar
equation is treated and a weak-convergence result for a Galerkin approximation
via the backward Kolmogorov equation is derived. Our methodology, however,
diﬀers considerably and, with it, the regularity assumptions required on the
functional of the solution.

The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we provide the notation
and the results on Malliavin calculus for inﬁnite dimensional L´evy processes
required for the weak-convergence result. In the third section, we introduce the
stochastic partial diﬀerential equation in question, as well as its approximation.
We then proceed with the proof of the main result on weak convergence of this
approximation.

2. Notation and preliminaries

Let (U, h·, ·iU ) and (H, h·, ·iH ) be separable Hilbert spaces and let L(U ; H)
be the space of all linear bounded operators from U into H endowed with the
usual supremum norm. If U = H, the abbreviation L(U ) := L(U ; U ) is used. An
element G ∈ L(U ; H) is said to be a nuclear operator if there exists a sequence
(xk, k ∈ ) in H and a sequence (yk, k ∈ ) in U such that

kxkkH kykkU < +∞

Xk∈

and G has, for ∈ U the representation

The space of all nuclear operators from U into H, endowed with the norm

kGkLN (U;H) := inf(Xk∈

∞

Xk=1

is a Banach space, and is denoted by LN (U ; H). If U = H, we use the abbre-
viation LN (U ). Furthermore, let L+
N (U ) denote the space of all nonnegative,
symmetric, nuclear operators on U , i.e.,

L+

N (U ) := {G ∈ LN (U )| hGy, yiU ≥ 0, hGy, ziU = hy, GziU for all y, z ∈ U } .

An operator G ∈ L(U ; H) is called a Hilbert-Schmidt operator if

for G, ˜G ∈ LHS(U ; H) and any orthonormal basis (ek, k ∈ ) of U . If U = H,
the abbreviation LHS(U ) := LHS(U ; U ) is used.
Given a measure space (S, S, µ) and r ∈ [1, +∞), we denote by Lr(S; H) the

the usual conditions. We denote by M2

2.1. Stochastic integration with respect to compensated Poisson random mea-

sures

Let (S, Σ, ν) be a σ-ﬁnite measure space. We introduce the notation ¯

Z+ :=
Z+ ∪ {+∞}. We, further, work on the measure space (S × T, Σ ⊗ B(T)) :=
(ST, ΣT) and denote by λ the Lebesgue measure on (T, B(T)).

WEAK CONVERGENCE OF SPDES WITH L ´EVY NOISE

Deﬁnition 2.1. A Poisson random measure on (ST, ΣT) with intensity mea-
sure µ := ν ⊗ λ is a mapping p : Ω × ΣT → ¯Z+ such that:

1. For all ω ∈ Ω, the mapping B 7→ p(ω, B) is a measure,

2. For all B ∈ ΣT, the mapping p(B) : ω 7→ p(ω, B) is a Poisson distributed

random variable with parameter µ(B),

3. For any pairwise disjoint B1, ..., BM ∈ ΣT, M ∈ , the random variables

p(B1), ..., p(BM ) are independent.

For B ∈ ΣT with µ(B) < ∞ we write

q(B) := p(B) − µ(B)

and call q the compensated Poisson random measure associated to p.

We assume that the underlying probability space is equipped with the ﬁl-

tration F = (Ft, t ∈ T) generated by q, i.e.,

Ft := σ(q((r, s] × A)|0 ≤ r < s ≤ t, A ∈ Σ, ν(A) < ∞).

With slight abuse of notation, we write q(t, A) := q((0, t] × A), for t ∈ T and
A ∈ Σ with ν(A) < ∞. Deﬁned like this we have that for all s, t ∈ T with s < t,
the increment q(t, A) − q(s, A) is independent of Fs and that (q(t, A), t ∈ T) is
a square integrable F -martingale.

As it is common, we start to deﬁne the stochastic integral with respect to a

compensated Poisson random measure, by considering elementary processes.

Deﬁnition 2.2. An H-valued stochastic process Φ : Ω × T × S → H is said to
be elementary if there exists some ﬁnite partition of T, given by 0 = t0 < ... <
tN = T , for some N ∈ , and for every n = 0, ..., N − 1 there exist pairwise
disjoint sets An

Mn ∈ Σ of ﬁnite ν-measure, such that

where Φn
The class of all elementary processes is denoted by E.

m ∈ L2(Ω; H) is Ftn -measurable, for m = 1, ..., Mn, n = 0, ..., N − 1.

For Φ ∈ E we deﬁne the stochastic integral with respect to the compensated

Poisson random measure q, for t ∈ T, by

It is clear that there is a unique

N 2

q (ST; H) := L2(Ω × T × S, PT(S),  ⊗ λ ⊗ ν; H),

where PT(S) denotes the σ-algebra of predictable sets in Ω × T × S, i.e.,

PT(S) := σ(cid:0){Fs × (s, t] × A|0 ≤ s < t ≤ T, Fs ∈ Fs, A ∈ Σ}
∪ {F0 × {0} × A|F0 ∈ F0, A ∈ Σ}(cid:1).

2.2. The Malliavin derivative

With the stochastic integral in hand, we shall outline the notion of the
Malliavin derivative as introduced in [11, Section 5]. Given a Poisson random
measure p on (ST, ΣT) with intensity measure µ = ν × λ, it will be convenient
to introduce the following notation. We write for a tuple B = (B1, ..., BM ),
B1, ..., BM ∈ ΣT, M ∈ ,

p(B) := (p(B1), ..., p(BM )),

and denote by em the m-th unit vector in R

M .

Deﬁnition 2.3. An H-valued random variable F : Ω → H is called cylindrical
if it has the form

n

F =

fi(p(B1), ..., p(BM ))hi,

Xi=1

M
+ → R and hi ∈ H
where Bm ∈ ΣT, with µ(BM ) < +∞ for m = 1, ..., M , fi : Z
for i = 1, ..., n, for some M, n ∈ . The collection of all H-valued cylindrical
random variables is denoted by C(Ω; H).

In the sequel, we always assume that the sets B1, ..., BM used in the repre-

sentation of F ∈ C(Ω; H) are pairwise disjoint.

WEAK CONVERGENCE OF SPDES WITH L ´EVY NOISE

Deﬁnition 2.4. For a cylindrical random variable F ∈ C(Ω; H), the Malliavin
derivative DF ∈ L2(Ω × ST; H) is deﬁned by

DF :=

M

Xi=1

Xm=1

(fi(p(B) + em) − fi(p(B))) 1Bm hi.

Note that the expression of the derivative does not depend on the particular
representation of F ∈ C(Ω; H). The proof of the following proposition can be
found in [11, Theorem 5.6].

Proposition 2.5. The operator D : C(Ω; H) ⊂ L2(Ω; H) → L2(Ω × ST; H) is
closable.

By abuse of notation, we let D stand for the closure of D : C(Ω; H) ⊂
1,2(Ω; H) the domain of this

L2(Ω; H) → L2(Ω × ST; H). We denote by D
closure which is a Banach space endowed with the norm

Proposition 2.6. Let φ : H → ˜H be Lipschitz-continuous, where ( ˜H, h·, ·i ˜H )
1,2(Ω; H). Then φ(F ) ∈
is an arbitrary separable Hilbert space, and let F ∈ D
D1,2(Ω; ˜H) with derivative

Dφ(F ) = φ(F + DF ) − φ(F ).

(4)

Proof. First, we assume that F ∈ C(Ω; H). Consider the sequence (φℓ, ℓ ∈ )
of functions φℓ : H → ˜H deﬁned by

φℓ(h) :=

ℓ

Xk=1Dφ(h), ˜hkE ˜H

˜hk,

h ∈ H,

where (˜hk, k ∈ ) denotes an arbitrary orthonormal basis of ˜H. Now, for every
ℓ ∈  we get

ℓ

φℓ(F ) =

gk(p(B1), ..., p(BM ))˜hk,

Xk=1

where the functions gk : Z

From this follows that, for all ℓ ∈ , φℓ(F ) ∈ C(Ω; ˜H) with derivative

If we prove that, for ℓ → ∞,

φℓ(F ) → φ(F ) in L2(Ω; ˜H) and
Dφℓ(F ) → φ(F + DF ) − φ(F ) in L2(Ω × ST; ˜H),

(5)

Equation (4) follows for φ, by the closedness of D. By the deﬁnition of (φℓ, ℓ ∈
) we have, for every h ∈ H, φℓ(h) → φ(h) as ℓ → ∞. This clearly forces
convergence a.e.
If we can ﬁnd dominating functions the
desired result follows from Lebesgue’s dominated convergence theorem. Indeed,
we have

in Equation (5).

kφℓ(F ) − φ(F )k ˜H ≤ kφ(F )k ˜H ≤ C (1 + kF kH ) ,

where we used the Lipschitz-property of φ and that, for all x ∈ H, ℓ ∈ ,

kφℓ(x) − φ(x)k ˜H ≤ kφ(x)k ˜H .

Further, we have

kDφℓ(F ) − (φ(F + DF ) − φ(F ))k ˜H

≤ kφℓ(F + DF ) − φℓ(F )k ˜H + kφ(F + DF ) − φ(F )k ˜H
≤ 2 kφ(F + DF ) − φ(F )k ˜H
≤ C kDF kH ,

where we used that, for all x, y ∈ H and ℓ ∈ ,

kφℓ(x) − φℓ(y)k ˜H ≤ kφ(x) − φ(y)k ˜H .

For F ∈ D1,2(Ω; H) arbitrary, we take a sequence (Fk, k ∈ ) ⊂ C(Ω; H)

such that

Fk → F in D1,2(Ω; H) as k → ∞.

Then, by the Lipschitz-continuity of φ, it holds that

kφ(Fk) − φ(F )kL2(Ω; ˜H) ≤ C kFk − F kL2(Ω;H) ,

where the right hand side tends to zero for k → ∞. By the closedness of D, the
proof is completed by showing that

Dφ(Fk) → φ(F + DF ) − φ(F ) in L2(Ω × ST; ˜H) as k → ∞.

WEAK CONVERGENCE OF SPDES WITH L ´EVY NOISE

8

For this purpose, we assume, by possibly considering a suitable subsequence of
(Fk, k ∈ ), that Fk → F -a.e. and DFk → DF  ⊗ µ-a.e. as k → ∞.
Since φ is continuous, we obtain convergence  ⊗ µ-a.e.. By the above and the
Lipschitz-continuity of φ, we have

kDφ(Fk) − (φ(F + DF ) − φ(F ))k ˜H

≤ kφ(Fk + DFk) − φ(Fk)k ˜H + kφ(F + DF ) − φ(F )k ˜H

≤ C(cid:0)kDFkkH + kDF kH(cid:1),

where the right-hand side converges in L2(Ω × ST). The result follows by the
application of a generalized version of Lebesgue’s dominated convergence theo-
rem.

Thanks to [11, Lemma 5.7], the operator D is densely deﬁned. Therefore

the following deﬁnition makes sense.

Deﬁnition 2.7. The divergence operator

δ : dom(δ) ⊂ L2(Ω × ST; H) → L2(Ω; H)

is deﬁned to be the adjoint of

D : D

1,2(Ω; H) ⊂ L2(Ω; H) → L2(Ω × ST; H).

From the deﬁnition, it is clear that, for all F ∈ D

1,2(Ω; H) and Φ ∈ dom(δ),

Lemma 2.8. For every φ ∈ L2(ST; H) it holds that δ(φ) ∈ D
D(δ(φ)) = φ.

1,2(Ω; H) and

Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that φ is a simple function

φ =

where Bi ∈ Σµ are pairwise disjoint sets and hi ∈ H. By [11, Lemma 5.9], we
have φ ∈ dom(δ) and

fi(p(B))hi,

where

fi(n) := ni − µ(Bi), n := (n1, ..., nM ) ∈ ZM

Thus, we get δ(φ) ∈ C(Ω; H) and

Now, let φ ∈ L2(ST; H) be arbitrary. We may choose a sequence (φℓ, ℓ ∈ )
of simple functions converging to φ in L2(ST; H). Since kδ(φℓ)kL2(Ω;H) =
kφℓkL2(ST;H), for ℓ ∈ , the sequence (δ(φℓ), ℓ ∈ ) converges in L2(Ω; H).
By the closedness of δ, we see that φ ∈ dom(δ) and δ(φℓ) → δ(φ) as ℓ → ∞.
Furthermore, we have

Dδ(φℓ) = φℓ → φ in L2(Ω × ST; H)

The assertion follows by the fact that D is closed.

We return to the situation where p is a Poisson random measure on (ST, ΣT)
with intensity measure µ = λ ⊗ ν. As before we consider the ﬁltration generated
by the corresponding compensated measure q.

Proposition 2.9. Let Φ ∈ N 2
Φ ∈ dom(δ) and

q (ST; H) be a predictable stochastic process. Then

δ(Φ) = I(Φ)(T ).

(7)

Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that Φ ∈ E is an elementary process as given in Equa-
tion (2) with Φn
m ∈ C(Ω; H), which are Ftn -measurable. As δ is linear we have,
by [11, Lemma 5.9],

δ(Φ) =

N −1

Mn

Xn=0

Xm=1

q((tn, tn+1] × An

m)Φn

m = I(Φ)(T ).

Since C(Ω; H) is dense in L2(Ω; H), the closedness of δ shows that E is contained
in dom(δ) and Equation (7) holds. Finally, since E is dense in N 2
q (ST; H),
applying the closedness of δ again, the assertion follows.

With the Malliavin derivative in hand we are able to prove the main result

on weak convergence.

3. Weak error estimate for the parabolic SPDEs

Assume L = (L(t), t ∈ T) is a L´evy process in a real separable Hilbert space
(U, h·, ·iU ) deﬁned on a ﬁltered probability space (Ω, F , (Ft, t ∈ T), ) satisfying
the usual conditions. We assume that for s, t ∈ T with s < t the increment
L(t) − L(s) is independent of Fs. We assume that L is square integrable and of

WEAK CONVERGENCE OF SPDES WITH L ´EVY NOISE

mean zero. It follows that L is a martingale with respect to (Ft, t ∈ T). It is
well-known that L is square integrable if and only if its L´evy measure ν satisﬁes

kuk2

U ν(du) < +∞.

(8)

ZU

Moreover, we assume that the Gaussian part of L vanishes. We always consider
a c`adl`ag modiﬁcation of L and deﬁne the jump process of L by ∆L(t) := L(t) −
L(t−), for t ∈ T. Let Q ∈ L+
N (U ) be the covariance operator of L, which is
determined by the L´evy measure ν via

hQx, ziU =ZU

x, z ∈ U.

deﬁnes a Poisson random measure on (T × U, B(T) ⊗ B(U )) with intensity
measure λ ⊗ ν. The associated compensated measure is denoted by

q := p − λ ⊗ ν.

In order to make the results of the previous section applicable, especially
Proposition 2.9, we assume that F and the ﬁltration (Ft, t ∈ T) are generated
by q.

Combining [21, Lemma A.2], Proposition 2.9 with (S, Σ) = (U, B(U )) and

Equation (6) we obtain
Proposition 3.1. If Φ ∈ L2(Ω×T, PT; LHS(U0; H)) and F ∈ D1,2(Ω; H), then

Our main objective is to prove weak convergence of the mild solution X :

Ω × T → H to the stochastic evolution equation

dX(t) + AX(t)dt = f (t)dt + G(t)dL(t)
X(0) = x0 ∈ H

(9)

We make the assumption:

WEAK CONVERGENCE OF SPDES WITH L ´EVY NOISE

11

Assumption 3.2. The data of the stochastic evolution equation (9) satisfy:

1. The linear operator A : D(A) ⊂ H → H is densely deﬁned, self-adjoint,

positive-deﬁnite and has a compact inverse.

2. The functions f : T → H and G : T → L(U ; H) are measurable and

bounded.

Under these conditions, −A is the generator of an analytic semigroup of con-
tractions (S(t), t ∈ T). The mild solution is then given by the variation of
constants formula

X(t) = S(t)x0 +Z t

S(t − s)G(s) dL(s).

Furthermore, by the assumption there exists an nondecreasing sequence
(λk, k ∈ ) of positive real numbers, which tends to ∞, and an orthonor-
mal basis (ek, k ∈ ) of H such that Aek = λkek. This enables us to deﬁne
fractional powers of the operator A in the following way.

x ∈ ˙H β, β ∈ {1, 2}, h ∈ (0, 1].

(11)

Discrete versions Ah : Vh → Vh of the operator A are then deﬁned in the
following way: For x ∈ Vh we deﬁne Ahx to be the unique element in Vh for
which

hx, yi ˙H 1 = hAhx, yi for all y ∈ Vh.

Obviously, Ah is self-adjoint and positive deﬁnite on Vh. Hence, −Ah is the
generator of an analytic semigroup of contractions on Vh, which is denoted by
Sh(t) := e−tAh, for t ∈ T. In what follows, we use the abbreviation

Fh(t) := Sh(t)Ph − S(t),

(12)
Given such a family of ﬁnite element spaces Vh ⊂ ˙H 1, we deﬁne, for h ∈ (0, 1],
an approximation (Xh(t), t ∈ T) of the solution (X(t), t ∈ T) to be the mild
solution to

t ≥ 0.

dXh(t) + AhXh(t)dt = Phf (t)dt + PhG(t)dL(t)
Xh(0) = Phx0 ∈ Vh

(13)

Therefore Xh : Ω × T → Vh, h ∈ (0, 1], is given by

Xh(t) = Sh(t)Phx0 +Z t

The following deterministic estimate will be used in the proof of our weak
error result stated in Theorem 3.4 below. For a proof, the reader is referred
to [24, Theorem 3.2]. There the result is formulated under the assumption that
−A is the Laplace operator with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions,
the proof, however, can be extended to the more general setting we work in.

Lemma 3.3. Let Equation (11) hold. Then there exists a constant C > 0 such
that for any h ∈ (0, 1] and t > 0

kFh(t)kL(H) ≤ Ch2t−1.

With this result in hand we prove our main result on weak convergence.

Theorem 3.4. Given a continuously Fr´echet-diﬀerentiable mapping φ : H → R
with Lipschitz continuous derivative, there exists a constant C(T ) > 0, indepen-
dent of h, such that

|E [φ(Xh(T )) − φ(X(T ))] | ≤ C(T )(1 + | ln(h)|)h2.

Proof. The mean value theorem yields
