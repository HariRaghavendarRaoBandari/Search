ABSTRACT

The ultrafast-rotating (Prot ≈ 0.44 d) fully convective single M4 dwarf V374 Peg is a well-known laboratory for studying intense
stellar activity in a stable magnetic topology. As an observable proxy for the stellar magnetic ﬁeld, we study the stability of the
light curve, and thus the spot conﬁguration. We also measure the occurrence rate of ﬂares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). We
analyse spectroscopic observations, BV(RI)C photometry covering 5 years, and additional RC photometry that expands the temporal
base over 16 years. The light curve suggests an almost rigid-body rotation, and a spot conﬁguration that is stable over about 16
years, conﬁrming the previous indications of a very stable magnetic ﬁeld. We observed small changes on a nightly timescale, and
frequent ﬂaring, including a possible sympathetic ﬂare. The strongest ﬂares seem to be more concentrated around the phase where
the light curve indicates a smaller active region. Spectral data suggest a complex CME with falling-back and re-ejected material, with
a maximal projected velocity of ≈ 675 km s−1. We observed a CME rate much lower than expected from extrapolations of the solar
ﬂare–CME relation to active stars.

1. Introduction

V374 Peg is an M4 dwarf (Reid et al. 1995) that ﬁrst raised in-
terest when Greimel & Robb (1998) detected frequent strong
ﬂares on the star. Batyrshinova & Ibragimov (2001) later ob-
served several ﬂares, including a superﬂare event, having 11m
amplitude in U ﬁlter. Montes et al. (2001) found, that V374 Peg
is part of the Castor kinematic group, thus has an age of approx-
imately 200 Myr. This young age is also supported by Vidotto
et al. (2011), who found evidence for a strong coronal wind.
Due to its high activity level and relative brightness (V ≈
11.m5), V374 Peg is a popular astrophysical laboratory for study-
ing stellar magnetic ﬁelds in young fully convective stars.
Donati et al. (2006) studied the magnetic ﬁeld of V374 Peg
using Zeeman–Doppler imaging on data covering three non-
consecutive rotations. They found that the star was rotating as a
solid body, and a dipole-like axisymmetric magnetic ﬁeld. This
result challenged theoretical dynamo models, which predicted
either rigid-body rotation with non-axisymmetric magnetic ﬁeld
(e.g. Küker & Rüdiger 1999), or axisymmetric ﬁelds, but with
diﬀerential rotation (e.g. Dobler et al. 2006). A recent study by
Yadav et al. (2015) proposed a dynamo model that can explain
solid-body rotation with dipole-like ﬁeld, and predicted long-

term stable magnetic conﬁguration. Based on observations from
three epochs spanning over a year Morin et al. (2008) detected a
very weak diﬀerential rotation and concluded that the magnetic
ﬁeld of V374 Peg is stable on this time scale.

In this paper we present analysis of photometric and spectro-

scopic data spanning over more than a half decade.

2. Observations
Photometric observations in BV(RI)C passbands were carried
out using the 1-m RCC telescope of Konkoly Observatory at
Piszkéstet˝o Mountain Station equipped with a Princeton Instru-
ments 1300 × 1300 CCD. The observations cover 71 nights in
total between 2008 July 31 and 2013 July 28 (HJDs 2454679–
2456502). Data reduction was done using standard IRAF1 pro-
cedures. Diﬀerential aperture photometry was done using the
DAOPHOT package. The resulting BV(RI)C light curves are
shown in Fig. 1. All ∆V data of this dataset is plotted together

1 IRAF is distributed by the National Optical Astronomy Observatory,
which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in As-
tronomy, Inc., under cooperative agreement with the National Science
Foundation.

against the rotational phase (see Sect. 3.3) in Fig. 2. We used
GSC 02215-01602, as comparison star for our light curves.

Additional CCD photometric data in Cousins R ﬁlter were
obtained from the automated 0.5-m telescope of the Climenhaga
Observatory of the University of Victoria from 1998 and 2000,
that were partly published in Greimel & Robb (1998).

The spectroscopic observations in 2012/2013 were carried
out by the 1-m RCC telescope, using the eShel spectrograph
of the Gothard Astronomical Observatory, Szombathely, Hun-
gary, in the spectral range 4200–8700Å with a resolution of
R ≈ 11 000 (Csák et al. 2014). The wavelength calibration was
done using a ThAr lamp. Reduction of these data was carried out
using standard IRAF procedures.

Additional spectra were downloaded from the public
database of Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope (CFHT)2. The
spectra were obtained between 2005 and 2009 by ESPaDOnS
(Donati 2003) with a spectral resolution of R ≈ 65 000 covering
the range between 3700–10400 Å. The spectroscopic observa-
tions are summarised in Table 1.

3. Analysis
3.1. Mass
Using the empirical absolute magnitude–mass calibration for
very low mass stars (M < 0.6M(cid:12)) of Delfosse et al. (2000), we
can get an empirical mass value following Morin et al. (2008).
According to the The Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS),
the magnitude of V374 Peg in J, H and K passbands are 7.635,
7.035, 6.777 magnitudes (Cutri et al. 2003), which translate to
the absolute magnitudes of 7.887, 7.287 and 7.029 respectively
using the parallax of 112.33 mas from the Hipparcos survey (van
Leeuwen 2007), if we neglect interstellar absorption (as the dis-
tance of the object is only 8.9 pc). These magnitudes yield to
mass values of 0.282, 0.285 and 0.281M(cid:12) for the three pass-
bands, respectively.

Using the magnitude–mass and magnitude–radius calibra-
tions for M-dwarfs of Mann et al. (2015) based on the K
magnitudes, we get a somewhat diﬀerent result as previously:
0.338 M(cid:12) for the mass and 0.335 R(cid:12) for the radius, in good agree-
ment with Morin et al. (2008). We can conclude that from these
diﬀerent methods the mass of V374 Peg is 0.30± 0.03M(cid:12)(the er-
ror estimated using the standard deviation of the diﬀerent mass
values).

3.2. Spectral energy distribution: is there an IR excess?
Scaltriti et al. (1993) studied active RS CVn systems, and found
infrared excess in 5 of 12 cases, which the authors interpreted as
evidence for an absorbing shell, a result of strong stellar wind.
Such excess was (unsuccessfully) searched also in active single

stars (Pandey et al. 2005), but was found in many fast rotating
evolved stars (Rodrigues da Silva et al. 2015). The latter authors
also considered the dust being the result of planetary collisions.
If we neglect interstellar reddening, we can easily determine
the intrinsic infrared colours of V374 Peg: (J − K)0 = 0.858
and (H − K)0 = 0.258 using the 2MASS magnitudes (Cutri et al.
2003). Comparing these values to the intrinsic colours of a main-
sequence M4 star (J − K = 0.839 , H − K = 0.282) based on the
work of Pecaut & Mamajek (2013), we ﬁnd a diﬀerence of 0.02
and −0.02 magnitudes, which is around the typical error of 0.03
magnitudes of the 2MASS observations.

The suggestion of Scaltriti et al. (1993), i.e., that stellar
winds due to high level of activity can induce infrared excess,
was further tested by plotting the spectral energy distribution
(SED), see Fig. 3. We used the VOspec tool3 that is capable
of obtaining both multi-wavelength photometric observations
and theoretical spectra. We downloaded ultraviolet observations
from the GALEX survey (Bianchi et al. 2011), and infrared ob-
servations from the 2MASS (Cutri et al. 2003), WISE (Cutri
& et al. 2014) and AKARI (Ishihara et al. 2010) surveys. We
also plotted our BV(RI)C observations from the Piszkéstet˝o RCC
telescope. To describe the photosphere we used the NextGen
(Hauschildt et al. 1999) model with the astrophysical parameters
of V374 Peg. All the points ﬁt the model photosphere, only the
measurements in the ultraviolet regime show a very strong ex-
cess consistent with the high chromospheric activity level. Thus
we conclude that V374 Peg does not have a signiﬁcant colour ex-
cess in the infrared bands, and does not possess a hot dust shell.

3.3. Fourier analysis

Fourier analysis of the photometric ∆RC data was performed
using MUFRAN4 (Kolláth 1990) – a code that can do discrete
Fourier transformation of data and pre-whiten light curves with
the detected frequencies – since this ﬁlter has the longest time
base of 16 years (1998–2013), as the observations at the Cli-
menhaga Observatory (Greimel & Robb 1998) were done using
only this ﬁlter. First, due to the diﬀerent comparison stars used at

the two observatories, the 1998 and 2000 datasets were shifted
to the mean RC of the Konkoly dataset, next, small amplitude
long-term trends were removed from the data. No systematic
long-term change resembling to a spot cycle, or part of it, was
found. The ﬁnal Fourier spectrum and the spectral window is
shown in Figure 4. The peak corresponding to stellar rotation is
at Prot = 0d.44570 ± 0d.00001 which is quite close to the ﬁnding
of 0.445679 days in Vida et al. (2011). We found the same re-
sult, Prot = 0.44570 days using the SLLK method (string length
method with Laﬂer–Kinman statistic, see Clarke 2002). In this
paper we used the following ephemeris:
HJD = 2453601.78613 + 0.44570 × E,
(1)
where HJD0 = 2453601.78613 is taken from Vida et al. (2011)
and E is the cycle count. After pre-whitening the Fourier spec-
trum with the signal of the rotation period, a very small peak
(with 0.m005 amplitude) corresponding to P = 0.445518 days in
the Fourier spectrum is seen. If we accept this as a signal origi-
nating also from the rotation, this would yield a diﬀerential ro-
tation shear of |α| = |∆P/P| (cid:38) 0.0004, which is very close to a
rigid-body rotation, in agreement with the ﬁndings of Vida et al.
(2013) and that of Morin et al. (2008) (α = 0.0004) and Donati
et al. (2006) (α = 0.0014). On GJ 1243, an other M4 star with
fast rotation of 0.59 days, Davenport et al. (2015) found a similar
diﬀerential rotation (|α| = 0.0011) to our estimate on V374 Peg.

ber of light curve points above 2σ/3σ after removing the eﬀect of spot-
tedness (bottom). Note that the top plot does not show the whole mag-
nitude range of ﬂares to better visualise the spotted light curve.

3.4. Light curve modelling

Light curve modelling was done using the code SpotModeL
(Ribárik et al. 2003) that applies an analytic approach, and uses
at most three circular starspots of homogeneous temperature
to ﬁt the photometric data. Limb darkening coeﬃcients were
adopted from Claret et al. (2012). From the colour indices we can
estimate the spot temperatures, we got about 3250 K for B − V
and V − IC indices (3267 ± 5K and 3244 ± 8K respectively, with
formal errors), supposing an unspotted temperature of 3400 K
corresponding to the dM4 spectral type. Thus, from the photo-
metric spot temperature model, we concluded, that the spots are
≈150 K cooler than the unspotted surface.
During the ≈5 years of observations, the light curve was very
stable (see Fig. 2), it can be described reasonably well by a two-
spot model. From the ∆V light curve, we can estimate the spot
parameters λ1 = 143 ± 2◦, β1 = 67 ± 3◦, γ1 = 42 ± 3◦ and
λ2 = 342±2◦, β2 = 71±4◦, γ2 = 36±4◦, where λ, β and γ means
the spot longitude, latitude and radius, respectively. According to
this model, the cool spots cover approximately 43% of the stellar
surface. This solution is of course not unique, and the parameters
are not independent. Spot latitude is the most uncertain, since
photometric observations hold only very little information on the
latitude of the spots, and the (formal) errors do not indicate the
uncertainty of the inclination.

4. Results
4.1. Photometric ﬂares

To study ﬂares on the star, we applied time series spot models to
remove the contribution of cool spots (see also Vida et al. 2009).
This was performed by SpotModeL, modelling the four-colour
light curves that were cleaned from ﬂares, in a time window of
100 days, and shifting this window by 30-day steps, thus reach-
ing a better-ﬁtting analytic solution to the observations. This ana-
lytic solution was then subtracted from the original observations,
leaving only the ﬂares and small scatter/variations on the level of
a few hundredth of magnitude.

All ∆B observations are plotted in Fig. 5 where the highest
amplitude ﬂares are truncated showing the spotted light curve

better. We can see in the top panel it is seen that ﬂares occur
in every phase of the rotational modulation. This could mean
many diﬀerent ﬂaring regions even near the pole so the ﬂares are
seen regardless of rotational phase. Such polar spot, would cause
only very small variations in the light curve, so other (non-polar)
active regions must be still present.

Since the time resolution of the data is not too high (around
3 minutes on average) small amplitude and short ﬂares could
be represented only by 1–2 deviating data points. The two his-
tograms on the bottom panel of Fig. 5 show the distribution of
such deviating points over 2σ (left) and 3σ (right) above the
folded light curve. A certain increase of such events is seen be-
tween phases 0.3–0.7 which suggests a more active centre of
ﬂaring on the stellar surface.

For the determination of the ﬂare frequency, we used the
method of Ishida et al. (1991), who deﬁned the mean occurrence
rate of ﬂares as:

n(cid:80) t ,
n being the number of observed ﬂares, and(cid:80) t (hr) the monitor-

ing time. We selected ﬂare events using the unspotted ∆B light
curve (see Sect. 3.4) by visual inspection, selecting ﬂares that
were brighter than 0.05 magnitude. To detect possible variations
in the ﬂaring activity, the ∆B light curve was divided into ﬁve
blocks (see top panel of Fig. 1). The ﬂare frequencies at the dif-
ferent blocks of the observations are summarised in Table 2. A
histogram of ﬂares with diﬀerent brightness is shown in Fig. 6.

The occurrence rate seems to be around 0.2–0.3 h−1, relatively
stable during the observations. However, ﬂares with peak bright-
ness higher than 0.m25 were only found in the second and fourth
block. In Fig. 6 we also show the cumulative ﬂare frequency dis-
tribution (log number of ﬂares that have larger amplitude than
log B, see e.g. Lacy et al. 1976; Hawley et al. 2014) as function
of the ﬂare amplitudes in B passband.

4.2. Flare energies

We selected a few well-observed ﬂare events which were de-
tected at least in two colours. There were deviating points caused
by ﬂares also in RC and IC passbands, but these detections were
too weak for modelling. We estimate ﬂare energies in diﬀerent
colours following the method in K˝ovári et al. (2007). Derived
values are listed in Table 3. Flare energy estimations are carried
out as follows. First, to derive the relative ﬂare energy for a given
−1 expression is integrated over the ﬂare duration,
event, the I0+ f
I0
where I0+ f
is the ratio of the ﬂaring and the quiescent intensi-
I0
ties at the selected photometric band. This quantity, deﬁned by
Eq. 2 in Gershberg (1972), is often mentioned in the literature
as equivalent duration. The total integrated ﬂare energy is then
obtained by multiplying the relative ﬂare energy by the basal
(i.e., quiescent) stellar ﬂux (see K˝ovári et al. 2007 for a more
detailed description). Flare energy values are estimated only for
those events, which are covered suﬃciently by multicolour ob-
servations.

Studies dedicated to photometric monitoring of dMe stars
such as EV Lac and AD Leo (Leto et al. 1997; Dal & Evren

2012) detected several ﬂares in B-band with energies up to
1033 erg, which ﬁts very well to the determined ﬂare energies of
V374 Peg. Moreover the most energetic solar ﬂares show total
energies up to 1033 erg (Schrijver et al. 2012; Kretzschmar et al.
2010). As one can see from Table 3, there are ﬂare energies de-
termined from B-band photometry, which show similar values,
underlining the violent and energetic nature of dMe star ﬂares.

The energy ratio emitted in the diﬀerent colors are about the
same for the ﬁrst event of a triple outburst at HJD 2454715.394,
and for the single events at HJDs 2455059.362 and 2455087.276,
being 1.37, 1.41, 1.41 for EB/EV, respectively. However, in case
of the triple event at 2454715 (see Fig. 10 for a detailed light
curve) the energy ratio EB/EV is decreasing during the three
consecutive outbursts (separated by about 1.4 and 0.5 hours) as
1.37, 1.28 and 1.10. The emitted energy decreases slower in V
than in B passband. This result strongly suggests that the three
consecutive eruptions are related. Such events are called sympa-
thetic ﬂares which were observed many times on the Sun, where
the origin of the ﬂares on the solar surface is well seen. One
such interesting example is the 2010 August 1 event on the Sun
where three prominence eruptions were observed in the same ac-
tive region consecutively, with about 6 and 12 hours diﬀerence.
The details of this event and its theoretical modeling is found in
Török et al. (2011), see also Attrill et al. (2007) and cf. K˝ovári
et al. (2007). Brieﬂy, these ﬂare events originate form successive
ﬂux rope eruptions triggered by nearby eruptions, in appropriate
magnetic ﬁeld structure of the solar corona.

The structure of the magnetic ﬁelds of M-dwarf stars, on a
much smaller surface are, to our best knowledge, simpler than
that of the Sun. Concerning stellar sympathetic ﬂares, similar
repetitive events to the triple ﬂare of V374 Peg were observed
on UV Cet by Panagi & Andrews (1995). The authors explained
the phenomenon by supposing strong dipolar magnetic ﬁeld on
the star, where propagation of MHD waves between the poles
through the corona and chromosphere triggers the eruptions at
the opposite poles. Such scenario is not unlikely on V374 Peg
either. According to Zeeman–Doppler imaging results of Donati
et al. (2006) and Morin et al. (2008) V374 Peg do have a strong
dipolar magnetic ﬁeld, which, similarly to UV Cet, may help in
triggering sympathetic eruptions.

enced by the ﬂares (this can be also a result of the low reso-
lution). The most powerful Hα ﬂares were observed in 2005.
Here, the increase of the Hα emission reappears after the con-
secutive rotations both around phases 0.2 and 0.9 with a small
phase shift (see also Fig. 11). A possible explanation for this
could be long-lived loop systems in the chromosphere that gen-
erate ﬂares/coronal mass ejections (CMEs).

On HJD 2453603 (see dynamic spectra in Fig. 9, H, He lines
in Fig. 12 and intensity curves for the Balmer lines in Fig. 14),
one can see 3 distinct blue wing enhancements with diﬀerent du-
rations and projected velocities, spanning over more than three
hours. The detailed chronology of these events is described in
Appendix A.

Interestingly, the overall level of the Hα line is quite low at
the time of the ﬁrst, double (or triple) peaked spectrum (see the
spectrum plotted in blue in Fig. 12). This could be similar to the
pre-ﬂare "dips" observed by Leitzinger et al. (2014) in the young
open cluster Blanco-1, although this feature – if real – is only
seen in one spectrum, and only in the Hα region. Unfortunately,
these events are very short (from a few seconds to a few min-
utes, see Leitzinger et al. 2014 and references therein) and rather
weak, thus the 5-minute sampling in our spectra is not optimal
for detecting these events.

To measure the ﬂux of the enhancement we select wave-
length windows which vary from 6547.0–6561.1 Å (722–
78 km s−1) to 6555.0–6561.1 Å (357–78 km s−1) from which we
subtract the continuum ﬂux measured in the same windows. The
continuum ﬂux level was adopted from the M4V star GJ699
taken from Cincunegui & Mauas (2004). As the blue-wing en-
hancement occurred during a ﬂare on V374 Peg it is diﬃcult to
disentangle the contribution from the ﬂare and the CME. We ex-
pect that the contamination of the blue wing of Hα from the ﬂare
occurs at small velocities close to Hα line center. With the usage
of ﬁxed windows we underestimate the total ﬂux caused by the
ejection. The estimation of the CME mass depends on the mea-
sured ﬂux. However, with the method we use for the estimation
of the CME mass (see next paragraph) we are able to determine
a lower limit to the CME mass only.

V374 Peg including also the observations from 1998 and 2000, after
removing long-term trends. The bottom plots show the change of Hα
equivalent width with rotational phase, colours brightening with time.

4.3. Variations of the Hα region

We obtained spectroscopic observations covering eight years
from 2005 August to 2013 August. The last three spectroscopic
observing runs – one with the CFHT, the last two with the 1-m
RCC telescope – have photometric support from the same ob-
serving season (cf. Fig. 1). As an example, the Hα regions from
the RCC observations are plotted in the online Fig. B.7.

To study the behaviour of the Hα line, we plotted its region as
dynamic spectra in Fig. 8. In these plots the horizontal and ver-
tical axes represent the wavelength/velocity shift and the phase,
respectively. The colour coding corresponds to the intensity of
the Hα region, i.e., colours darken with line strength. Triangles
at the left side of the plots show the phases of the observations.
The plot regions at missing phases were interpolated to the clos-
est measurements using spline interpolation. Colour coding is set
individually for each plot so the typical variations can be well
seen.

Equivalent width of the Hα line was measured for each spec-
trum using the splot task of IRAF. The variations of the equiv-
alent width with phase was plotted along with a phased light
curve (after pre-whitening with long-term trends) for compar-
ison in Fig. 11 (cf. Fig. 10 of Morin et al. 2008 for a similar
analysis of the 2005 observations).

The Hα line of V374 Peg is constantly in strong emission.
Obvious rotational modulation can be seen only in the 2009
CFHT spectra, in other cases the phased data are mainly inﬂu-

From the Hα blue wing ﬂux enhancement one can estimate

(3)

hν j−iA j−i

the mass of the CME. We use
MCME ≥ 4πd2Fem(Ntot/Ni)mHηOD
adopted from Houdebine et al. (1990). Eq. 3 is comprised of the
distance of the star d, the ﬂux of the emission feature Fem, the
total number of hydrogen atoms Ntot, the number of hydrogen
atoms in an excited state i, Ni, the opacity damping factor ηOD,
the mass of a hydrogen atom mH, the Einstein coeﬃcient for
transition A j−i, frequency ν, and Planck’s constant h. As we have
no estimation for the ratio Ntot/N3 (corresponding to Hα) we
follow the method from Leitzinger et al. (2014). First they used
the Balmer decrement (BD) to scale the measured Hα ﬂux to
Hγ, i.e. Fem,γ = Fem,α/BD, with BD = 3 valid for solar and
stellar ﬂares (Butler et al. 1988). Then the parameters of the Hγ
line can be used in Eq. 3, including the value Ntot/N5 ∼ 2 × 109
given by Houdebine et al. (1990) which is valid for temperatures
of about 20 000 K and densities of 1010 − 1012 cm−3 and was
derived from NLTE radiative transfer modelling. Furthermore,
we adopt ηOD = 2 to account for optical thickness of the lower
Balmer lines (Houdebine et al. 1990).

According to the above described estimation of the CME
mass, we ﬁnd a minimum CME mass in the order of 1016g.
This value is comparable to the most massive solar CME masses
reaching 1017g (see e.g. Vourlidas et al. 2010).

To estimate the expected number of CMEs above 1016 g
mass, we make use of the method applied in Leitzinger et al.
(2014). This method uses ﬂare rates predicted by the scaling of
ﬂare rate with stellar X-ray luminosity from Audard et al. (2000)
together with a CME mass-ﬂare energy relation from the Sun
(Drake et al. 2013) to estimate stellar CME rates from stellar X-
ray luminosities. Adopting log LX ≈ 28.4 erg s−1 for V374 Peg
(Hünsch et al. 1999) we infer 15–60 CMEs per day with a mass
> 1016 g for a range of ﬂare power law indices α of 1.8–2.3
(Leitzinger et al. 2014, their Fig. 5). These numbers are larger
than what has been observed in this study (1 event in 10 h), but
the detectability of stellar CMEs is aﬀected by projection eﬀects
(random directions of ejection, not always leading to suﬃciently
blue-shifted signals). Moreover, the extrapolation of ﬂare–CME
relations known from the Sun to young active stars is still de-
bated (Drake et al. 2013). In section 5.3 we discuss these results

Article number, page 8 of 13

with respect to the so far detected stellar CMEs from literature,
which are sparse.

In the case of the HJD 2453605 ﬂare event, no signiﬁcant

velocity shifts can be seen that could indicate CMEs.

5. Discussion
5.1. Connection between the photosphere and

chromosphere

The connection between the chromospheric and photospheric
activity on the Sun is known for a long time. Such connection
was also observed on other active stars, e.g., in the case of the
dM1–2 type EY Dra (Korhonen et al. 2010), the fully convective
K7-type T Tauri star TWA 6 (Skelly et al. 2008) and other BY
Dra type stars (Pandey et al. 2005). To study the behaviour of
the chromosphere, the Hα region is the most widely used proxy
for M dwarfs. In the case of a Sun-like connection between the
photosphere and chromosphere we would expect anticorrelation
between the light curve and the Hα equivalent width, i.e., the
chromospheric activity would increase at those phases, where
we see the dark spots in the light curve. The case is not neces-
sarily that obvious, since bright photospheric structures on the
Sun, as well as prominence-like features are seen better oﬀ-limb
rather than when projected against the stellar disc (Hall & Ram-
sey 1992). In Fig. 11 the Hα equivalent widths from diﬀerent
epochs are plotted along with the phased ∆R light curve. This
dataset has the longest time-span of 16 years, and shows stable
light curve all the time, before and after the spectroscopic ob-
servations were taken. Unfortunately the spectroscopic results
from the RCC telescope (in 2012 and 2013) are quite incon-
clusive, as the size of the telescope did not allow to use short
exposures, thus the shorter-term variations caused by possible
ﬂares cannot be temporally resolved. In the case of the CFHT
data (between 2005 and 2009) an obvious anticorrelation can be
seen in 2009 September. Without any indication of ﬂares, just
a rotational modulation was apparent. Interestingly, this is the
part of the photometric observation, where frequent strong ﬂare
activity was observed, there are photometric observations three
weeks before, and one week after these spectra were obtained.
In the case of the 2005 and 2006 spectra, no global trends are
seen, just variations caused by ﬂares, especially in 2005. Here,

the increase of the Hα activity seems to be concentrated around
phases 0.2 and 0.8–1.0, the latter being the part where the light
curve shows the faintest state.

In Fig. 15 folded ∆B light curves are plotted in those epochs
that were used for ﬂare statistics (see Sect. 4.1). The global shape
of the light curve, i.e., the large-scale spot conﬁguration does not
change in this time signiﬁcantly. Flares can be seen in all cases
at every phase, however the strongest ﬂares seem to be more
concentrated around phase 0.3–0.7 (see also Fig. 5).

5.2. Photometric variability

We found that the light curve, thus the overall surface struc-
tures are stable for at least 16 years on V374 Peg (cf. Fig. 11,
top panel). This agrees with the ﬁnding of Morin et al. (2008)
who found that the magnetic conﬁguration did not change on a
yearly time scale. The star furthermore seems to rotate as a rigid
body, or has a very weak diﬀerential rotation as we found from
the Fourier analysis (see Sect. 3.3), in agreement with the results
of Donati et al. (2006) based on Zeeman–Doppler images. Ac-
cording to the theoretical model of Küker & Rüdiger (2011), we
would expect α ≈ 0.008 for a star of 0.3M(cid:12) and Prot = 0.5 d. Our
ﬁndings are in good agreement with recent theoretical dynamo
model for fully convective stars of Yadav et al. (2015) which

suggests that these stars have stable magnetic ﬁelds, very small
diﬀerential rotation, polar spots, and active regions distributed
throughout the stellar phase (implying ﬂare distribution indepen-
dent of rotation phase).

However, besides this stable spot conﬁguration, the light
curve is not constant at all: small changes can be seen contin-
uously on a nightly timescale (see Fig. 15). These variations
are mainly seen between phases 0.3–0.6. These minute intensity
variations could be caused by newly born and decaying small
spots in the same active nest, similarly to the emerging ﬂux ropes
in active nests on our Sun.

5.3. CMEs

The CME/ﬂare detected on V374 Peg in the CFHT data on HJD
2453603 represents a unique event compared to the ones from
literature. First of all the length of the observations (more than
10 hours of continuous monitoring) enables the comparison of
variability before and after the event. Stellar CMEs are sporad-
ically observed phenomena, and their detection so far presented
in literature happened by chance, except the event presented by
Guenther & Emerson (1997), who performed a dedicated search
for stellar activity through spectrophotometry in Hα. In litera-
ture only single events, which the authors have assigned to stel-

lar CMEs, can be found. Houdebine et al. (1990) detected the
fastest CME so far on a late-type main-sequence star AD Leo
in the optical, which showed a maximum projected velocity of
≈ 5800 km s−1. Further events in the optical domain were pre-
sented by Gunn et al. (1994) on the dMe star AT Mic, Guen-
ther & Emerson (1997) on a dM0 weak-line T-Tauri star, and
Fuhrmeister & Schmitt (2004) on an old dM star. Stellar CME
events in the UV/FUV were presented by Bond et al. (2001)
on the pre-cataclysmic binary V471 Tau, and Leitzinger et al.
(2011) again on AD Leo. Interestingly, all detected CMEs with
the method of Doppler-shifted emission in optical spectra have
been detected on dMe stars to date.

In the case of V374 Peg, we detected three distinct blue-wing
enhancements which happened during a ﬂare (cf. the discussion
on sympathetic ﬂares in Sect. 4.2), after a quiet period of at least
3 hours (see Figs 9, 12 14). The chronology of the three events is
that at t0, BWE1 arises simultaneously with an Hα ﬂare. Nearly
2 hours later, BWE2 begins to rise, and ﬁnally 50 minutes later
the fastest event, BWE3 starts. We calculated an escape veloc-
ity for V374 Peg of ve ≈580 km s−1 using 0.30 M(cid:12) and 0.34
R(cid:12) (see Sect. 3.1). The projected maximum velocity of BWE3
(675 km s−1) is above the escape velocity, this means that dur-
ing this event, mass was ejected from the star. The two precur-
sor events (BWE1, BWE2) show maximum velocities below ve
(each ≈ −350 km s−1) and therefore can not be distinctively as-
signed to mass ejected from the star. If we assume that all three
events belong to the same active nest then BWE1 and BWE2
could also be failed eruptions. On the Sun, events have been
reported (Zhou et al. 2006) where prominences failed to erupt,
while the remaining ﬁlament has reformed, being then ejected,
and observed as a CME. The observed red wing enhancements
after the CME event could be a result of material falling back on
the stellar surface, as seen on the Sun.

If we assume that the event is connected with the photo-
spheric active regions, as seen e.g. on the Sun, but also other
stars (see e.g. Korhonen et al. 2010), we can give an estimation
of the real velocity of the CMEs. According to the spot models,
both active nests are located around 70◦ latitude (although this
is the most uncertain spot parameter), this means that the CME
happened roughly along the line of sight assuming an inclination
of 70◦ (see Donati et al. 2006). This suggests that the projected
velocity could be close to the true velocity of the ejection. An
uncertainty of ≈ 10◦ in the inclination or the spot latitude would
cause only a diﬀerence of 1–2% in the maximal speed of the
ejecta.
The three events span over a time range of ≈3 hours, which
corresponds to about 30% of the stellar rotation period. If, as
assumed above, the signatures are connected to the same active
nest, then the rotation of the nest has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on
the projected velocity of the events. BWE1 started at phase 0.72,
while the centre of the large spotted region is at λ ≈ 340◦, i.e.
0.94 phase. If this eruption happened in the middle of this nest,
we would thus only observe ≈ 19% of the actual velocity (ne-
glecting the eﬀect of the latitude), for BWE2 and BWE3 this
value is 95% and 98%, respectively. The large size of the active
region (γ ≈ 42◦ radius) however causes a rather large uncertainty
in these estimated values.

Although V374 Peg has a rotation period of < 0.5 days, its
Hα proﬁle is not suﬃciently rotationally broadened (v sin i =
36.5 km s−1, see Morin et al. 2008) to detect absorption features
as signatures of co-rotating clouds (Collier Cameron & Robin-
son 1989) which are commonly interpreted as stellar analogs of
solar prominences.

ever, the method to determine the mass of stellar CMEs used
in this paper is probably accurate only within an order of magni-
tude. Non-Local Thermal Equilibrium (NLTE) modelling is nec-
essary to self consistently calculate the radiative transfer from
which a more accurate mass may be determined.

The theoretical CME rate which we have deduced based on
the method presented in Leitzinger et al. (2014), relies on the
solar CME mass–ﬂare energy relation (Aarnio et al. 2012) and
the empirically determined ﬂare power-law from Audard et al.
(2000). Depending on the ﬂare index α the obtained CME rate
is 15–60 CMEs (M>Mc, Mc=1016 g) per day. However, only a
fraction of this number can be observed due to projection eﬀects
when assuming that CMEs can be ejected anywhere from the
star.

The stellar parameter on which the theoretical CME rate de-
pends on is the stellar X-ray luminosity as indicator for activity.
V374 Peg has a log Lx of 28.4 erg s−1 (Hünsch et al. 1999) which
is roughly one order of magnitude higher than for the Sun dur-
ing activity cycle maximum (Peres et al. 2000). The observed
CME rate of the Sun considering a whole cycle (Robbrecht et al.
2009) lies between 0.5 and 8 CMEs per day on average which
is lower than the theoretical CME rate of V374 Peg, as expected
(although it is possible that the reason for this discrepancy is that
we simply cannot observe most of the stellar CMEs). One has to
keep in mind that the solar–stellar analogy might work for solar-
like stars, the extrapolation of solar knowledge to dM stars has to
be done very carefully. The question if young stars exhibit also
more massive CMEs than the Sun is still an open issue.

However, the extrapolation of solar CME parameter distri-
butions is the only possibility at the moment to gain knowledge
on CME frequency on stars others than the Sun, since no obser-
vationally determined CME parameter distributions of late-type
main-sequence stars exist.

6. Summary
We summarised stellar parameters of V374 Peg in Table 4.

– The light curve is stable over about 16 years, that conﬁrms

the previous indications of a very stable magnetic ﬁeld;

– Besides the stable spot conﬁguration, small changes can be
seen on a nightly timescale, possibly caused by newly born
and decaying small spots in the same active nest;

– According to Fourier analysis, there is only one signiﬁcant
peak in the power spectrum corresponding to the stellar ro-
tation and an additional small amplitude signal close to it;

– The Fourier spectrum suggests very weak diﬀerential rota-
tion (almost solid-body), we found indication of a shear pa-
rameter of α = 0.0004;

– There is no sign of activity cycles in the light curve;
– Frequent ﬂaring was observed. The occurrence rate of weak
ﬂare seems to be similar in every season on average, but
the frequency of strong ﬂares varies on weekly-monthly
timescales within a year;

– Flares were observed at every rotation phase, the strongest
ﬂares seem to be more concentrated around phase 0.3–0.7,
i.e. where the light curve indicates a smaller active region
(or an activity nest on the southern hemisphere that can be
only partly seen);

– In the light curve a complex ﬂare was detected with repeated
eruptions. The similar B/V energy ratios suggest a sympa-
thetic ﬂare event;

– In the spectroscopic data a complex eruption including a
CME was detected with falling-back and re-ejected material,
with a maximal projected velocity of ≈ 675 km s−1;

– We estimate the mass of the ejecta higher that 1016 g, which

is comparable to the strongest solar CME masses;

– The observed CME rate is much lower than expected from
extrapolation of the solar ﬂare–CME relation to active stars,
that could indicate that the solar–stellar analogy could not be
applied to the cool dMe stars directly;

– The spectral energy distribution does not suggest hot dust
around the star that could be a result of high activity and
strong stellar wind.

and the double peaked feature is also less prominent. In the next
spectrum ≈ 5 minutes later the double peak almost disappears,
and the continuum levels is also lowered. During the next one
and a half hours the Hα peak stays increased whereas the wings
are not broadened anymore.

Then at HJD 2453603.966 (t2), the blue wing of Hα starts
to rise again (BWE2) although the peak is still increased. The
blue-wing asymmetry lasts for 50 minutes, and shows a maxi-
mum projected velocity of −350 km s−1 again. The red wing of
Hα increases much slower. Also the blue wings of Hβ and Hγ
increase and show projected velocities of −275 km s−1.

At HJD 2453604.001 (t3), although the blue wing of Hα
did not reach its quiescent form,
the Hα blue wing starts
to rapidly increase (BWE3) and forms a broad enhancement
present for ≈45 minutes, showing a maximum projected ve-
locity of −675 km s−1. And also the Hβ and Hγ show similar
blue wing enhancement, with maximum projected velocities of
−620 km s−1. After this turbulent events Hα, Hβ, and Hγ show
red wing enhancements lasting for nearly 2 hours.

Appendix B: Attempts on Doppler imaging
We have tried to derive Doppler images from the CFHT spectra
downloaded from the CFHT Science Archive with two codes:
TempMap (Rice et al. 1989) and INVERS7PD (Piskunov et al.
1990; Hackman et al. 2001). In both cases, three consecutive
spectra were averaged in order to increase signal-to-noise. The
resulting smearing were always lower than the surface resolu-
tion of our reconstructions, i.e., 5◦. Astrophysical parameters
were adopted from Donati et al. (2006) and Morin et al. (2008).
With TempMap, Kurucz atmospheric models (Kurucz 1993) were
used, while the INVERS7PD attempts were carried out with the
MARCS models. Atomic parameters were obtained from the
VALD database (Piskunov et al. 1995; Kupka et al. 1999).

The inversions were attempted on both Ca i 6439 and
Fe i 6430. Other mapping lines in the region have not been used
due to insuﬃcient line strength or heavy blending with molecular
bands. Ultimately, both inversion attempts proved unsuccessful.
We suspect that the causes are the following:
– Both the Kurucz and the MARCS models are insuﬃcient in

the domain of M dwarfs.

– It is possible, that due to the extremely strong chromospheric
activity, the otherwise photospheric lines (mostly in case of
the Ca i 6439) are burdened with emission cores.

– The region containing the lines used during the inversion is

heavily aﬀected by molecular bands.

Thus, synthesizing adequate model spectra and ﬁtting them to
the observed data proved virtually impossible. We conclude
however, that an inversion attempt on TiO bands might be possi-
ble with data of higher S/N.

Appendix A: Detailed description of the complex

CME event on HJD 2453603

On HJD 2453603 a complex CME event was observed in the
spectra (see dynamic spectra in Fig. 9, H, He lines in Fig. 12 and
intensity curves for the Balmer lines in Fig. 14). The chronology
is as follows: blue wing enhancement №1 (BWE1) starts at HJD
2453603.89 (t1), lasts for nearly ≈ 30 min. and reaches a max-
imum projected velocity of ≈ −350 km s−1. Also the red wing
of Hα is increased but not as signiﬁcant as the Hα blue wing.
At the same time the Hα proﬁle starts to rise and marks the be-
ginning of an impulsive ﬂare phase. We detect a double-peaked
Hα line, with maxima at −45 km s−1 and 15 km s−1, and also an
additional narrower peak at −65 km s−1 (see also Fig. 12). At
the same time the Hβ and Hγ lines rise dramatically and show
a symmetrically broadened line proﬁle, in contrast to the blue
asymmetric broadened Hα proﬁle (BWE1). Moreover the He i
line strength at 5876 Å also dramatically increases during the
impulsive ﬂare phase (see Figs. 12 and 13). In the next spectrum
≈ 15 minutes later, the narrow peak cannot be seen any more,
