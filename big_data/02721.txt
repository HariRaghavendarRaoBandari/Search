Abstract. Common models for two-phase lipid bilayer membranes are based on an energy
that consists of an elastic term for each lipid phase and a line energy at interfaces. Although
such an energy controls only the length of interfaces, the membrane surface is usually assumed
to be at least C 1 across phase boundaries. We consider the spontaneous curvature model for
closed rotationally symmetric two-phase membranes without excluding tangent discontinuities
at interfaces a priorily. We introduce a family of energies for smooth surfaces and phase ﬁelds
for the lipid phases and derive a sharp interface limit that coincides with the Γ-limit on all
reasonable membranes and extends the classical model by assigning a bending energy also to
tangent discontinuities. The theoretical result is illustrated by numerical examples.
Keywords: Γ-convergence, phase ﬁeld model, lipid bilayer, two-component membrane.

Introduction

Lipid bilayer membranes are the building block of numerous biological systems and appear
in a rich variety of shapes. In particular, membranes consisting of two or more lipid phases
display a complex morphology, which is aﬀected by their elastic properties as well as phase
separation [21, 9, 3].

A well-established model for the shape of two-phase vesicles is the spontaneous curvature

model, where equilibrium shapes are described as surfaces minimising the energy

among all closed surfaces M = M + ∪ M− ∪ ∂M +, M + ∩ M− = ∅ with prescribed areas for
M± (and prescribed enclosed volume) [7, 12, 13, 16, 22]. Here H and K are the mean and
the Gauss curvature of the membrane surface M , and µ is its area measure. The bending
rigidities k± > 0 and the Gauss rigidities k±G are elastic material parameters, and H±s , the
so-called spontaneous or preferred curvatures, are supposed to reﬂect an asymmetry in the

within each lipid phase but diﬀerent between the two phases.
Apart from the length H1(∂M +) of phase boundaries multiplied by a constant line ten-
sion σ, (1.1) does not control the membrane surface at the interface ∂M + = ∂M−; studies
of two-phase membranes, however, commonly include an a priori smoothness assumption.
J¨ulicher and Lipowsky [16] consider the Euler-Lagrange equations of (1.1) for axially sym-
metric membranes that have exactly one interface between the two lipid phases and are C1
across this interface. Du, Wang [28] and Lowengrub, R¨atz, Voigt [17] perform numerical
simulations using a phase ﬁeld for both the membrane and the lipid phases; Elliot and
Stinner [10, 11] consider a surface phase ﬁeld model. Convergence to the sharp interface
limit in these approaches is obtained by asymptotic expansion and under strong smoothness
assumptions on the limit surface; in particular, the membrane is again assumed to be at

least C1 across interfaces. In [14] we prove that for rotationally symmetric membranes this
regularity need not be assumed, but is included in the Γ-limit of an appropriate surface
phase ﬁeld approximation.

Mathematically, however, the natural setting for the energy (1.1) does not contain C1
regularity across interfaces. Moreover, the numerical simulations in [28, 10] show that
equilibrium shapes of models including C1 regularity have rather ample neck regions, see
also Figure 3.3 on the left, while shapes observed in experiments do not [3]. In this paper
we study a diﬀuse interface approximation for the lipid phases of rotationally symmetric
membranes whose sharp interface limit allows tangent discontinuities or kinks at interfaces,
thus inﬁnitesimally small neck regions. More precisely, for a closed surface Mγ obtained by
rotating a curve γ about the x-axis and an associated rotationally symmetric phase ﬁeld
u : Mγ → R, we consider an approximate energy of the form

W (u) dµ +(cid:90)Mγ

ε|B|2 dµ. (1.2)

Apart from the surface setting, the second integral in (1.2) is the usual Modica-Mortola
approximation of the interface energy. With a standard double well potential such as
W (u) = (1 − u2)2, the phase ﬁeld is forced to ±1 as ε → 0 and the ﬁrst integral in (1.2)
resembles the curvature energy in (1.1), provided that k, kG, and Hs are extensions of
k± = k(±1), k±G = kG(±1), and H±s = Hs(±1). The third integral, where B denotes the
second fundamental form of Mγ, is on the one hand necessary for compactness of energy-
bounded sequences as ε → 0. On the other hand, it assigns a curvature to kinks in the limit
by penalising their size, thereby providing a meaningful extension of (1.1).

The bending parameters and their extensions play a crucial role in our approxima-
tion. For biological membranes it is well-known that k± > 0, but measurements of the
Gauss rigidities are scarce. Available data suggest that k±G < 0 and that the inequalities
k± > −k±G/2 hold at least for some monolayers [23, 25]. It turns out that we need similar
conditions for the extensions: we let k, kG : R → R be continuous and bounded functions
such that k(±1) = k±, kG(±) = k±G,

infR k > 0,

sup

kG < 0,

and

infR (k + kG/2) > 0.

(1.3)

The preferred curvature extension Hs : R → R can be any continuous bounded function such
that Hs(±1) = H±s . Under these conditions there is a δ > 0 such that (1 − δ)k > −kG/2,
and Young’s inequality together with |B|2 = H 2 − 2K implies

where C > 0 depends only on k, kG, and Hs. By (1.4) the energy (1.2) provides weighted
L2-bounds for B and H, which are used to establish equi-coercivity and a lower bound
inequality. These bounds degenerate for u ≈ 0, and similarly to the Ambrosio-Tortorelli
approximation for free discontinuity problems [2], this degeneracy allows curvatures to be-
come large and yield kinks in the limit. Interestingly, conditions such as (1.3) also appear
in [4], where the authors obtain a partial Γ-convergence result for a diﬀuse interface ap-
proximation of the membrane surface of single-phase vesicles.

Under the above restrictions on the parameters, we prove that a limit of (1.2) is given

by

(1.5)

for membranes (γ, u), γ = (x, y) with membrane surface Mγ and lipid phases u ∈ {±1}.
Here S denotes the set of interfaces, that is, the set of jumps of u, and of tangent disconti-
nuities of γ. An interface is penalised essentially by its length 2πy(s) = H1(Mγ({s})), while
a kink carries an additional “bending” energy 2π|[γ(cid:48)](s)|y(s), where |[γ(cid:48)](s)| is the modulus
of the angle enclosed by the two one-sided tangent vectors at s modulo 2π. The constants
σ and ˆσ are given by

σ =(cid:90) 1

and

ˆσ = 2(cid:112)W (0).

(1.6)

The set Mγ({y > 0} \ S) is the part of Mγ that is obtained by rotating the restriction of
γ to {y > 0} \ S, and Lγ({y = 0}) denotes the length of the segment γ({y = 0}). Here
and in the following {y = 0} is the set where γ lies on the axis of revolution and {y > 0}
the set where it does not. A limit membrane (γ, u) for which (1.5) is ﬁnite may touch the
axis of revolution not only at the end points of γ, but also in regions in the interior, see
Figure 3.1 for a non membrane-like example. Our limit equals the Γ-limit of Fε on “good”
membranes where |γ(cid:48)| = const, and exactly regions on the axis of revolution prevent us
from obtaining full Γ-convergence. However, a “good” limit is for instance a membrane
that touches the axis of revolution only at countably many points, hence our result covers
reasonable biological membranes.

The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 is a brief recapitulation of surfaces of
revolution. In Section 3 we state our approximate setting, the limit, and the convergence
result; we also present some numerical examples and compare our model to one without
kinks. The proof of the convergence theorem is presented in Section 4, and in Section 5 we
consider some generalisations of our result, including a brief discussion of the full Γ-limit.

2 Surfaces of revolution
Let I ⊂ R be an open and bounded interval and γ = (x, y) : I → R × R
≥0 a Lipschitz
parametrised curve in the upper half of the xy-plane. We denote by Mγ the surface in R3
obtained by rotating γ about the x-axis, that is, Mγ is the image of I × [0, 2π) under the
Lipschitz continuous map

Φ : (t, θ) (cid:55)→ (x(t), y(t) cos θ, y(t) sin θ);

γ is called generating curve of Mγ. Since γ and Φ are Lipschitz, they are weakly and almost
everywhere diﬀerentiable with bounded derivatives. The length of γ, the area measure of
Mγ, and the area of Mγ are well-deﬁned and given by

Lγ =(cid:90)I

|γ(cid:48)(t)| dt,

dµ = |γ(cid:48)|y dt dθ,

and

Aγ = 2π(cid:90)I

|γ(cid:48)|y dt,

respectively. If J is a measurable subset of I, we denote by Mγ(J) the part of Mγ that is ob-
tained by rotating the curve segment γ(J) and write Lγ(J) and Aγ(J) for the corresponding
length and area.

After removing at most countably many constancy intervals, pulling holes together and
reparametrising, we may assume that γ is parametrised with constant speed |γ(cid:48)| ≡ Lγ/|I| =:
qγ > 0 almost everywhere in I [6, Lemma 5.23]. Then the tangent space T(t,θ)Mγ, which
exists for almost every (t, θ) ∈ I × [0, 2π), is spanned by the orthonormal vectors

and

(2.1)

Since Mγ is not necessarily embedded, tangent space, normal, and the quantities deﬁned
below are associated to the parameter (t, θ) and not to the point Φ(t, θ) on the surface Mγ.
We consider a function f : Mγ → Rk to be a function F : I × [0, 2π) → Rk of the
parameters; on embedded parts of Mγ this amounts to f (Φ(t, θ)) = F (t, θ). Given a tangent
vector ξ at (t0, θ0) ∈ I × (0, 2π), the directional derivative of f in direction ξ is deﬁned as

where η : (−δ, δ) → I ×[0, 2π) is a C1-curve satisfying η(0) = (t0, θ0) and d
The tangential gradient of f : Mγ → R is the vector

,

∇Mγ f = (Dξ1f )ξ1 + (Dξ2f )ξ2,

and since Dξ1f = |γ(cid:48)|−1∂tF , we obtain for a rotationally symmetric f , which does not
depend on θ, that

∇Mγ f (t, θ) =

F (cid:48)(t)

where | · | is the Euclidean norm in R3.

and

|∇Mγ f (t, θ)| =

|F (cid:48)(t)|
|γ(cid:48)(t)| ,

For the rest of this section let γ ∈ W 2,1

loc (I; R2) be twice weakly diﬀerentiable, thus
twice diﬀerentiable almost everywhere, and assume that y > 0 in I. Then the normal ν is
weakly diﬀerentiable, thus the shape operator S : T(t0,θ0)M → T(t0,θ0)M , ζ (cid:55)→ Dζν and the
second fundamental form B : T(t0,θ0)M × T(t0,θ0)M → R, (ζ, ξ) (cid:55)→ ξ · Sζ are well-deﬁned for
almost every (t0, θ0). The matrix representation with respect to the basis {ξ1, ξ2} of both
is diag(κ1, κ2) where

κ1 =

−y(cid:48)(cid:48)x(cid:48) + y(cid:48)x(cid:48)(cid:48)

|γ(cid:48)|3

and κ2 =

x(cid:48)
y|γ(cid:48)| .

(2.2)

The eigenvalues κ1, κ2 of S are the principal curvatures of Mγ, and κ1 is just the signed
(y(cid:48),−x(cid:48)). The mean curvature H and the
curvature of γ with respect to the normal
Gauss curvature K of Mγ are

H = trace S = κ1 + κ2

and

K = det S = κ1κ2.

1 + κ2

By |B|2 = |S|2 = κ2
2 we denote the squared Frobenius norm of S and B. The signs
of the principal curvatures and the mean curvature depend on the choice of the normal.
In the above setting a unit ball has outer unit normal ν as in (2.1) and curvatures κ1 =
κ2 = +1 when it is parametrised “from left to right” such that x(cid:48) ≥ 0, for instance by
γ(t) = (− cos t, sin t), t ∈ [0, π].

Let ϕ : I → R be an angle function for γ, that is, let ϕ(t) be the angle between the
positive x-axis and the tangent vector γ(cid:48)(t). Since W 2,1
loc(I), the angle
ϕ can be chosen continuously in I and is then uniquely determined up to adding multiples
of 2π. In terms of ϕ, the curve γ is characterised by ﬁxing one point and

3 The models

3.1 Approximate setting

We study the energy (1.2) with continuous bounded functions Hs, k, kG. The precise values
of k and kG do not enter our arguments as long as (1.3) is satisﬁed, so we assume k ≡ k± =
1 = −k±G ≡ −kG for simplicity of notation. Thus, our approximate energy is given by

Fε(γ, u) = Hε(γ, u) + Iε(γ, u),

(3.1)

where

Hε(γ, u) =(cid:90)Mγ

u2 (H − Hs(u))2 − u2K dµ

is the Helfrich energy of the membrane (γ, u) and

the interface energy. For J ⊂ I we denote by Fε(γ, u, J), Hε(γ, u, J), and Iε(γ, u, J) the
corresponding integrals restricted to the set Mγ(J). The double well potential W : R →
[0,∞) is a continuous function that vanishes only in ±1 and is C2 around these points; for
simplicity of notation we assume that W is symmetric.

We study (3.1) for rotationally symmetric membranes (γ, u) ∈ C × P, where

C :=(cid:110)γ = (x, y) ∈ C0,1(I; R2) ∩ W 2,1

loc (I; R2) :

and

The ﬁrst three conditions in the deﬁnition of C ensure that the constant speed curve γ
generates a closed surface Mγ. The requirement x(cid:48) ≥ 0 ﬁxes the orientation and, since
by embedding γ ∈ C belongs to C1
loc(I; R2), it guarantees that Mγ is embedded; its main
purpose is to exclude some very non membrane-like behaviour such as inﬁnitely many self-
intersections or zigzagging of curves in the limit. The L2-bound on B and the ﬁrst two
conditions on the phase ﬁelds ensure that (3.1) is well-deﬁned for (γ, u) ∈ C × P. The
uniform bound (cid:107)u(cid:107)
≤ C0 with a constant C0 (cid:29) 1 is more restrictive than necessary,
∞
and in many places in the proof it can be replaced by weaker conditions such as integral
bounds on u. We impose the L∞ bound for convenience though, and as one expects phase
ﬁelds with small energy to be roughly between +1 and −1 for small ε, this is not a strong
restriction.

The area constraints for the two lipid phases are incorporated by prescribing the area
of Mγ and the phase integral: if in (1.1) the areas of the lipid phases M± are A±, then the
choice A0 = A+ + A− and m = (A+ − A−)/A0 ensures the correct phase areas in the limit
ε → 0. Through the integral constraint the set P depends on the chosen γ ∈ C, but since we
usually consider pairs or membranes (γ, u), we suppress this fact in the notation. We neglect
the constraint on the enclosed volume of the membrane, because it is not necessary for our
considerations. It will become obvious that this constraint changes continuously under the
convergence we prove and can thus be reintroduced without changes of the arguments.
Remark. For γ ∈ C it is easy to see that Mγ is a C1 surface and Mγ(J) is a W 2,2 surface for
any J (cid:98) I. More precisely, γ = (x, y) ∈ C1(I; R2) ∩ W 2,2
loc (I; R2), y ∈ W 2,1(I), γ(cid:48) is perpen-
dicular to the axis of revolution at ∂I, and these regularity properties cannot be improved
[14, Section 2.2]. The energy (3.1) is invariant under reparametrisations that preserve the
orientation of γ and the regularity properties of (γ, u). In particular, if (γ, u) satisﬁes all
requirements of C × P but only |γ(cid:48)| (cid:54)= 0 instead of |γ(cid:48)| = const, the corresponding constant
speed parametrisation belongs to C × P and has the same energy. Hence, considering only
|γ(cid:48)| = const is no geometric restriction.

By our assumptions (1.3) on the bending parameters, the calculations in (1.4) yield

To establish compactness, we use that the ﬁrst variation of Mγ bounds the length of the
generating curve γ. Such a bound is for instance deduced from the well-known bound on
the intrinsic diameter from [26] or for surfaces of revolution easily proved by an integration
by parts as in [14, Section 2.3].

Remark. Combining Lemmas 3.1 and 3.2, we see that any sequence (γε, uε) ∈ C × P with
uniformly bounded energy has uniformly bounded length. For this conclusion we could
have argued with(cid:82) u2H 2 + εH 2 dµ directly, instead of using the second fundamental form
like ε(cid:82) H 2 dµ or ε(cid:82) |B|2 dµ is necessary to obtain the length bound. Let Mε be a sequence
of “dumbbells” that consist of two spheres, which are smoothly connected by a cylinder
of length lε and diameter hε, and let the phase ﬁeld uε be 0 on the cylinder and +1
and −1 on the spheres with exactly one transition with gradient of order ε−1 at each
connection. Then Hε ∼ 0 on the cylinder and Hε is bounded independently of ε on the
spheres. The contribution of uε ∼ 0 on the cylinder and of the two phase transitions
stems from(cid:82) ε|∇Mεuε|2 + 1
ε lεhε + hε, and the smoothing of the
connections between the cylinder and the spheres can be done where uε ∼ 0; see Section 4.3
for the details of the construction of a recovery sequence. Thus, if lε → ∞ and hε → 0 such
that lεhε ∼ ε, the energy without ε(cid:82) |B|2 dµ is bounded, but the length of the generating
curve is unbounded as ε → 0; (γε, uε) can easily be made admissible for some A0 and m,

ε W (uε) dµε and is of order 1

since the area and phase constraint, which are disturbed by the vanishing cylinder, can be
recovered by slightly perturbing the spheres. On the other hand, ε(cid:82) |B|2 dµ ∼ εlε/hε on
the cylinder, and therefore lε → ∞ is excluded by a uniform bound on Fε.
The scaling of ε in the stabilising term is critical. If the energy contains εp(cid:82) |B|2 dµ

with p > 1, the above example still works and there is no length bound. If p < 1, tangent
discontinuities in the limit are excluded, since an argument similar to the proof of Lemma 3.1
yields an Lq-bound for some q > 1 on the second fundamental form and thus on κ1; compare
the equi-coercivity arguments in Section 4.1.

3.2 Limit setting
The major technical diﬃculties in the limit of (3.1) as ε → 0 stem from the appearance
of kinks and from the axis of revolution. In particular, at the axis the compactness result
for sequences (γε, uε) and the regularity properties of the limit are weaker than elsewhere.
Limit curves will have parametrisations in

D :=(cid:110)γ = (x, y) ∈ C0,1(I; R2) :

|γ(cid:48)| ≡ qγ = const in{y > 0} , |γ(cid:48)| = x(cid:48) ≤ qγ in{y = 0} ,
y(∂I) = {0} , y ≥ 0, x(cid:48) ≥ 0
there is Sγ ⊂ {y > 0} s. t. H1(Mγ(Sγ)) < ∞ and
(cid:90)Mγ ({y>0}\Sγ )

|B|2 dµ < ∞, Aγ = A0(cid:111).

A curve γ ∈ D is globally Lipschitz with Lipschitz constant qγ, and its restriction to
{y > 0} is a constant speed parametrisation. Since {y > 0} ⊂ R is open, it is the union of
its countably many connected components, which are disjoint intervals. In a slight abuse
of language we refer to a component ω of {y > 0} also as component of γ and call Mγ(ω)
a component of Mγ. Thus, Mγ consists of at most countably many components, which are
connected through the axis of revolution.
Due to H1(Mγ(Sγ)) < ∞ the set Sγ ∩ J is ﬁnite for any J (cid:98) {y > 0}, and since S
can be written as countable union of such sets it is countable. The bound on the second
fundamental form yields γ ∈ W 2,2(J \ Sγ; R2). By embedding into C1(J; R2) the tangent
vector γ(cid:48) is continuous from either side at any s ∈ Sγ, that is, Sγ indeed contains the
tangent discontinuities of γ in {y > 0}.
In contrast to C, a component Mγ(ω) of Mγ, γ ∈ D is embedded only between adjacent
kinks, but in general not globally. Moreover, if kinks accumulate at a ∈ ∂ω, the limit of
γ(cid:48)(t) as t → a, t ∈ ω need not exist; γ(cid:48) is perpendicular to the axis of revolution in the
following weak sense.
Lemma 3.3. Let ω = (a, b) be a component of γ = (x, y) ∈ D and assume that (sj) ⊂ Sγ∩ω
is a decreasing sequence such that sj → a as j → ∞ and γ ∈ W 2,2(sj+1, sj) for all j ∈ N.
Then the one-sided approximate limit of x(cid:48) vanishes at a, that is

and |y(cid:48)| has one-sided approximate limit qγ. Moreover, γ is almost piecewise straight near

Figure 3.1: Example of a curve γ ∈ D. The component on the left is regular except for
one kink. In the right component kinks accumulate at both ends, where at the left end
the limit tangent exist, but at the right end it does not. In the centre there are countably
many self-similar components ωk decreasing from right to left such that one can easily ﬁnd
a scaling of γ(ωk) and Lγ(ωk) that leaves B bounded in L2.

Proof. Lipschitz continuity of y implies y(t) ≤ y(a) + qγ(t − a) ≤ qγρ in (a, a + ρ), hence
using (2.2) we conclude

The right hand side tends to zero as ρ → 0, because the L2-norm of the second fundamental
form of Mγ(ω \ Sγ) is ﬁnite. The approximate limit qγ of |y(cid:48)| follows from y(cid:48)2 = q2
γ − x(cid:48)2

For the straightness recall (2.6) and |B|2 ≥ |K| almost everywhere in ω, thus

Consequently,

and likewise for x(cid:48) due to x(cid:48) ≥ 0 and

|x(cid:48)(t) − x(cid:48)(s)|2 ≤ |x(cid:48)2(t) − x(cid:48)2(s)| = |y(cid:48)2(t) − y(cid:48)2(s)| ≤ 2qγ|y(cid:48)(t) − y(cid:48)(s)|.

According to Lemma 3.3, γ consists roughly of straight line segments when approaching
the component boundary, but the directions of these segments may vary as long as the
approximate limit is perpendicular to the axis of revolution. If kinks do not accumulate
near a component boundary, then, as for γ ∈ C, the classical limit tangent exists and is
perpendicular to the axis of revolution. An example for a curve in D is given in Figure 3.1.

To γ ∈ D we associate a phase ﬁeld u in

Q :=(cid:110)u : I → [−C0, C0] : u ∈ {±1} piecewise constant in{y > 0} ,

(cid:90)Mγ

u dµ = mA0, H1(Mγ(Su)) < ∞(cid:111).

M. Helmers

Here Su ⊂ {y > 0} denotes the jump set of u, and we call s ∈ Su and the corresponding
circle Mγ({s}) an interface of (γ, u). The set Q resembles the set of special functions of
bounded variation SBV with values in {±1}, weighted with the height y of the generating
curve γ = (x, y) ∈ D. Indeed, for u ∈ Q and any J (cid:98) {y > 0} we have u ∈ SBV (J;{±1}),
but jumps of height 2 may accumulate near the axis of revolution and u is not speciﬁed in
{y = 0}. We emphasise that in our notation Su and Sγ are subsets of {y > 0}, because kinks
and interfaces on the axis of revolution do not contribute to the limit energy deﬁned below.
Moreover, kinks are not restricted to interfaces, that is, there may be points s ∈ Sγ \Su. We
call such points ghost interfaces, as opposed to proper interfaces, since their contribution to
the limit energy is concentrated on lines as for interfaces and contains the interface energy
of the latter.

For (γ, u) ∈ D × Q we consider the energy F = H + I with Helfrich energy

H(γ, u) =(cid:90)Mγ ({y>0}\Sγ )

(H − Hs(u))2 − K dµ

and interface energy

I(γ, u) = 2π (cid:88)s∈Sγ∪Su(cid:0)σ + ˆσ|[γ(cid:48)](s)|(cid:1) y(s) + 2πˆσLγ({y = 0});

as before, F(·,·, J), H(·,·, J), and I(·,·, J) denote the restrictions to J ⊂ I. Recall that σ, ˆσ
are given by (1.6) and that |[γ(cid:48)](s)| denotes the modulus of the angle enclosed by the two
one-sided tangent vectors at s modulo 2π, that is, the jump of the tangent vector because
its length is ﬁxed. The size of {y = 0} appears in I, because it stems from the second
fundamental form in Iε, and {y = 0} might be interpreted as a (ghost) interface between
components of Mγ. As for Fε, we ﬁnd

H(γ, u) ≥ 1

and bounds corresponding to (3.3)–(3.5). Moreover, also F is invariant under reparametri-
sations that preserve orientation and regularity properties.

3.3 Convergence theorem
We extend Fε and F to C0(I; R2) × L1(I) by setting Fε(γ, u) = F(γ, u) = ∞ whenever
(γ, u) does not belong to C × P or D × Q, respectively. The main result of this paper is the
following theorem.
Theorem 3.4. The energies Fε are equi-coercive, that is, any sequence ((γε, uε)) ⊂ C × P
with uniformly bounded energy Fε(γε, uε) admits a subsequence that converges in C0(I; R2)×
L1({y > 0}) to some (γ, u) ∈ D×Q. Furthermore, Fε converges to F in the following sense:
• any sequence ((γε, uε)) ⊂ C0(I; R2) × L1(I) that converges to (γ, u) in C0(I; R2) ×

L1({y > 0}) satisﬁes the lower bound inequality

Fε(γε, uε) ≥ F(γ, u);

Fε(γε, uε) ≤ F(γ, u).

Theorem 3.4 diﬀers from Γ-convergence in two aspects. First, the underlying conver-
gence of the phase ﬁelds uε in L1({y > 0}) depends on the limit curve γ = (x, y), because
there is in general insuﬃcient control on uε in {y = 0}. Of course, due to (cid:107)uε(cid:107)
≤ C0 we
∞
could extract a weakly-(cid:63) convergent subsequence, but since the L∞-bound is artiﬁcial and
the value of the limit u in {y = 0} is not used by F, we prefer the above setting, where the
limit phase ﬁeld is essentially undeﬁned in {y = 0}. Second, in the upper bound inequality
we construct a recovery sequence only for limits (γ, u) with constant speed |γ(cid:48)| in all of I.
Nevertheless, as for Γ-convergence it is true that almost minimising sequences for Fε cluster
only in minimisers of F.
Corollary 3.5. Let (γε, uε) ∈ C ×P converge to (γ, u) ∈ D ×Q in C0(I; R2)× L1({y > 0})
such that Fε(γε, uε) = inf Fε + o(1)ε→0. Then (γ, u) minimises F in D × Q.
Proof. Given an arbitrary ((cid:101)η,(cid:101)w) ∈ D×Q,(cid:101)η = (x(cid:101)η, y(cid:101)η), a constant speed parametrisation of
the membrane represented by ((cid:101)η,(cid:101)w) is found as in Section 2 and the ﬁrst remark in Section
3.1: First, removing constancy intervals of(cid:101)η in {(cid:101)y = 0} does not change the membrane, its
area, energy F, or phase integral. Then, if (cid:101)η has no constancy intervals and I = (a, b), the
is strictly increasing, and the parametrisation (η, w) = ((cid:101)η ◦ ψ−1,(cid:101)w ◦ ψ−1), η = (xη, yη) has
constant speed L(cid:101)η/(b− a). Since ψ is aﬃne in each component of(cid:101)η, the pair (η, w) inherits
its diﬀerentiability properties and bounds in {yη > 0} from ((cid:101)η,(cid:101)w) in (cid:8)y(cid:101)η > 0(cid:9). Again,
Fε(ηε, wε) ≤ F(η, w) = F((cid:101)η,(cid:101)w),

With a recovery sequence (ηε, wε) for (η, w) we now obtain
F(γ, u) ≤ lim inf
ε→0

Fε(γε, uε) = lim inf
ε→0

and by arbitrariness of ((cid:101)η,(cid:101)w) we conclude that (γ, u) has minimal energy F.

The relation between F and Γ-limFε is discussed further in Section 5.

3.4 Numerical examples
Since it is deﬁned for relatively smooth membranes, Fε is better suited for numerical sim-
ulation than F and can be compared to an approximation of a limit without kinks given
by

Eε(γ, u) =(cid:90)Mγ

(H − Hs(u))2 − K dµ +(cid:90)Mγ

(3.6)
for (γ, u) ∈ C×P. The energy (3.6) has been studied in numerical simulations and by means
of formal asymptotic expansion for arbitrary smooth surfaces, for instance in [10, 11]. For
rotationally symmetric membranes the Γ-limit of (3.6) is given by

on membranes (γ, u) such that Mγ is a topological sphere [14].

For numerical illustrations we consider a gradient ﬂow type evolution for Eε and Fε
that consists of an L2 ﬂow for the surface and a weighted L2 ﬂow for the phase ﬁeld; the
constraints are incorporated by Lagrange multipliers. This ﬂow has to our knowledge ﬁrst
been studied in [10, 11], where the derivation of the ﬂow equations is presented in full detail.

The initial data for the simulations below is shown in Figure 3.2. The surface is a
cylinder of length 3 and radius 1/2 with spherical caps; it is centred in the origin so that

Figure 3.3 shows the numerically stationary membranes and the angle between their
generating curves and the positive x-axis for Eε and Fε with ε = 0.05. Obviously, while
there is a smooth and rather ample neck region for Eε, the curve for Fε makes a sharp
turn: the angle almost jumps from about −0.5 to 1.05, and the neck region is limited to a
small neighbourhood of the approximate kink, which compares well with the experimental
observations in [3]. Also, the light phase uε = 1 of the membrane is closer to a round sphere
for Fε than for Eε.

A diﬀerent behaviour can be seen in Figure 3.4, which shows the numerically stationary

membrane for the energy (cid:101)Fε that diﬀers from Fε in that no Gauss curvature is present; we
shape for the corresponding energy (cid:101)Eε is the same as for Eε in Figure 3.3, because the Gauss
curvature integral in Eε is a topological invariant. One can see that the neck for (cid:101)Fε has
smaller diameter than for (cid:101)Eε, there is, however, no kink, and the neck region is as ample as
for (cid:101)Eε.

4 Proof of Theorem 3.4

The proof of Theorem 3.4 follows the ideas of [15], where we studied a one-dimensional
analogue of two-phase membranes, and is split into the three steps equi-coercivity, lower
bound, and upper bound inequality. In the following we write Mε instead of Mγε and so
forth when considering sequences of membranes. If convenient for clariﬁcation, we also add
an index γ or ε to other quantities such as µ, H, and so on.

4.1 Equi-coercivity
Lemma 4.1. Let ((γε, uε)) ⊂ C×P be a sequence with uniformly bounded energy Fε(γε, uε).
Then there exist (γ, u) ∈ D × Q, γ = (x, y), a countable set S ⊂ {y > 0} with Sγ ∪ Su ⊂ S
and S ∩ J ﬁnite for any J (cid:98) {y > 0}, and a subsequence, not relabelled, such that

• γε ∗(cid:42) γ in W 1,∞(I; R2);
• uε → u in Lp({y > 0}) for any p ∈ [1,∞);
• γε (cid:42) γ in W 2,2
• in any J (cid:98) {y > 0} \ S there holds |uε| ≥ 1/2 for all suﬃciently small ε.

loc ({y > 0} \ S; R2);

Proof. Let γε = (xε, yε) and |γ(cid:48)ε| = qε. With Lemma 3.1, Lemma 3.2, and H¨older’s inequality
we ﬁnd

2πqε|I| = 2πLε ≤(cid:18)Aε(cid:90)Mε

H 2 dµ(cid:19)1/2

,

thus the sequence (qε) is uniformly bounded from above. Since translations in x-direction
do not change the energy, we may assume that all γε have a common end point. Hence,
(γε) is bounded in W 1,∞(I; R2) and we may extract a subsequence such that qε → q and
γε ∗(cid:42) γ = (x, y) in W 1,∞(I; R2) = C0,1(I; R). In particular, y ≥ 0, y(∂I) = {0}, and the
convergence of (γε) is uniform in I. Since the set of non-negative functions is closed under

A0 = Aε = 2πqε(cid:90)I

yε dt → 2πq(cid:90)I

y dt

we conclude that neither q = 0 nor y ≡ 0 in I. Without loss of generality, we assume q = 1,
thus |γ(cid:48)| ≤ 1 almost everywhere in I.
Uniform convergence implies that for any J (cid:98) {y > 0} there is a constant cJ > 0 such
that yε ≥ cJ in J for all suﬃciently small ε. Therefore,

and the well-known arguments of Modica and Mortola [19, 20] apply in J, see in particular
[5, Lemma 6.2 and Remark 6.3] for a proof in one dimension. The outcome is a ﬁnite set of
points SJ ⊂ J and a piecewise constant function u : J → {±1} whose jump set is contained
in SJ such that a subsequence of uε converges to u in measure and almost everywhere in
J \ SJ . Since (uε) is uniformly bounded in L∞(I), convergence in Lp(J) for any p ∈ [1,∞)
follows. Moreover, in the one-dimensional setting we obtain that in any set compactly
contained in J \ SJ we have |uε| ≥ 1/2 for all suﬃciently small ε.
Exhausting {y > 0} by a sequence of increasing sets such as Jk = {y > 1/k} as k → ∞
and taking a diagonal sequence, we ﬁnd an at most countable set S ⊂ {y > 0} with S ∩ J
ﬁnite for any J (cid:98) {y > 0}, a function u : {y > 0} → {±1} with Su ⊂ S, and subsequence
of (uε) that converges to u in measure and almost everywhere in {y > 0} and that satisﬁes
|uε| ≥ 1/2 in any J (cid:98) {y > 0} \ S for all suﬃciently small ε > 0 depending on J. From the
uniform L∞-bound on uε we infer convergence in Lp({y > 0}) for any p ∈ [1,∞).
Along this subsequence we establish further compactness of the curves. Given J (cid:98)
{y > 0} \ S, there holds qε ≤ 2, |uε| ≥ 1/2, and yε ≥ cJ for all suﬃciently small ε > 0.
Therefore, using (2.7) we ﬁnd that

of γ(cid:48) in J and that the whole sequence converges weakly in W 2,2(J; R2). This shows γε (cid:42) γ
loc({y > 0} \ S; R2) and γ(cid:48)ε → γ(cid:48)

by exhausting {y > 0}\ S. The inequality H1(Mγ(Su∪ Sγ)) < ∞ follows from (4.1) and the
fact that each kink or interface s ∈ Su ∪ Sγ carries at least an energy of 2πσy(s) in the limit
ε → 0. The details are given in the lower bound section and thus are omitted here.

The following corollary renders the convergence around possible kinks more precise and

will be used to establish the lower bound.
Corollary 4.2. For any subsequence as in Lemma 4.1 there are angle functions ϕε ∈
L∞(I) ∩ W 1,2
loc (I) of γε that converge weakly in BVloc({y > 0}) to an angle function ϕ of γ
in {y > 0}. Moreover, ϕ ∈ W 1,2(J \ S) for any J (cid:98) {y > 0}.
Proof. Without loss of generality let I = (0,Lγ) and qγ = 1. Since γε ∈ W 2,2
loc (I; R2)
and x(cid:48)ε ≥ 0 by deﬁnition of C, there are angle functions ϕε ∈ W 1,2
loc (I; [−π/2, π/2]) of γε.

is uniformly bounded by Lemma 3.1 for all suﬃciently small ε > 0. Hence, ϕε is uniformly
bounded in W 1,1(J) and there exists a subsequence that converges weakly in BV (J) to some
ϕ, that is, ϕε → ϕ in L1(J) and κ1,ε dt restricted to J converges weakly to the measure
dϕ(cid:48). Consequently, γ(cid:48)ε = qε(cos ϕε, sin ϕε) → (cos ϕ, sin ϕ) = γ(cid:48) in Lp(J; R2), that is, ϕ is an
angle function of γ. Since this argument can be applied to any subsequence, convergence of
the whole sequence (ϕε) in BV (J) follows, and ϕ is deﬁned almost everywhere in {y > 0}
by exhaustion. Arguing as for γ(cid:48)(cid:48)ε in Lemma 4.1, we obtain ϕε (cid:42) ϕ in W 1,2((cid:101)J) for any
(cid:101)J (cid:98) {y > 0} \ S and
Exhausting J (cid:98) {y > 0} by (cid:101)J (cid:98) J \ S yields ϕ(cid:48) ∈ L2(J \ S) and ϕ ∈ W 1,2(J \ S).

(4.2)
whenever (γε, uε) converges to (γ, u) in C0(I; R2) × L1({y > 0}), it suﬃces to consider
sequences such that the left hand side of (4.2) is ﬁnite and the limit inferior is attained.
Then by deﬁnition of Fε we have (γε, uε) ∈ C × P, and the equi-coercivity result yields
(γ, u) ∈ D × Q and the convergence properties listed in Lemma 4.1 and Corollary 4.2. In
the following we consider the bulk energy H, kinks and interfaces, and the axis of revolution
separately.

estimate the integral from above by extending its domain to Mε({y > 0}). The right hand

4.2.2 Kinks and interfaces
Next we consider the interface energies Iε and I in {y > 0}. Points in S \ (Su ∪ Sγ) do
not contribute to the limit energy I, so it suﬃces to examine s ∈ Su ∪ Sγ. In the following
let J (cid:98) {y > 0} be an interval around s such that J ∩ S = {s}, which exists because
S ∩ {y > y(s)/2} is ﬁnite. Again, we assume without loss of generality that qγ = 1.
If s ∈ Su \ Sγ is an interface without kink, we estimate the curvature term in Iε from
below by zero and use a standard argument for the other terms as in [5, Chapter 6]. That
is, from the convergence of uε we deduce that there are points aε, bε ∈ J such that aε → s,
bε → s, uε(aε) → −1, uε(bε) → +1, and without loss of generality aε < s < bε. By Young’s
inequality and a change of variables we obtain

If s ∈ Su ∩ Sγ is a kink and a proper interface, let (ϕε) be angle functions of (γε) in J

that converge weakly in BV (J) to an angle function ϕ of γ. We then have

ϕ(cid:48)εyε dt → [ϕ](s)y(s) −(cid:90)J\{s}

κ1y dt,

where κ1 = −ϕ(cid:48) ∈ L2(J \ {s}) is the curvature of γ in J \ {s} and [ϕ](s) the jump of the
angle ϕ at s. Since x(cid:48)ε ≥ 0, we may assume ϕε ∈ [−π/2, π/2], so that [γ(cid:48)] = [ϕ] ∈ [−π, π].
The key step for the lower bound in J is to formalise the intuition that γε approaches the
kink where uε is close to zero.

Proof. We show that the complement of Jε,δ in J contains only the absolutely continuous
part of dϕ(cid:48). Let β > 0 be arbitrary but ﬁxed, and let Uβ = [s − β, s + β]. As J \ Uβ (cid:98)
{y > 0} \ S, we have |uε| ≥ 2δ in J \ Uβ for all suﬃciently small ε according to Lemma 4.1,
and therefore J ∩ Jε,δ ⊂ Uβ. Writing wε = ϕ(cid:48)εyε + κ1y, we have

With the second integral we deal as in (4.5); the only diﬀerence is that we now ﬁnd an
interval (aε, bε) ⊂ J \ Jε,δ such that uε(aε) → δ, uε(bε) → 1 on one side of s, and the same
with −δ and −1 on the other side. Combining both estimates and taking the lower limit as

Taking the supremum over δ > 0 ﬁnishes the proof.

Finally, if s ∈ Sγ \ Su is a ghost interface, then the phase ﬁeld u is constant in J, say
u ≡ 1. The argument with the splitting of J into J ∩ Jε,δ and J \ Jε,δ is as in Lemma 4.5,
but now there is an interval (aε, bε) ⊂ J \ Jε,δ such that uε(aε) → δ, uε(bε) → 1 on either
side of s. Hence, we conclude

Iε(γε, uε, J) ≥ ˆσ|[γ(cid:48)](s)|y(s) + 4y(s)(cid:90) 1

and the right hand side is equal to ˆσ|[γ(cid:48)](s)|y(s) + σy(s) due to the symmetry of W . The
same argument holds when u ≡ −1 near s.

The above reasoning extends to any ﬁnite subset S of Sγ ∪ Su, and we obtain

lim inf
ε→0

Iε(γε, uε,{y > 0}) ≥ 2π(cid:88)s∈S(cid:0)ˆσ|[γ(cid:48)](s)| + σ(cid:1) y(s).

Since the left hand side is independent of S, we conclude the lower bound for kinks and
interfaces

Iε(γε, uε,{y > 0}) ≥ 2π (cid:88)s∈Sγ∪Su(cid:0)σ + ˆσ|[γ(cid:48)](s)|(cid:1) y(s) = I(γ, u,{y > 0}).

4.2.3 Axis of revolution

To motivate the lower bound estimate at the axis of revolution, we ﬁrst consider the simple
example that γε(t) = (qεt, yε), yε ∈ R is a straight horizontal line segment in R = {y = 0}
such that yε → 0 as ε → 0. Then κ1,ε = 0, while κ2,ε = 1/yε blows up and contributes to
the limit of Fε. From the uniform bound on

and x(cid:48)ε = qε → q = x(cid:48) in R we get uε → 0 in R. Therefore, the potential term contributes
to the limit energy. On the other hand, there is no reason for uε to have a large gradient in
R, and it is reasonable to assume that uε tends to zero suﬃciently fast so that there is no
contribution of Hε(γε, uε, R) in the limit. Then

4.3 Upper bound inequality

This section is devoted to the upper bound inequality

Fε(γε, uε) ≤ F(γ, u)

lim sup

ε→0

whenever (γ, u) ∈ D × Q has ﬁnite energy and γ is parametrised with constant speed.
We ﬁrst approximate (γ, u) by a sequence of simple membranes in D × Q that have a
ﬁnite number of components and ﬁnitely many (ghost) interfaces. We construct a recovery
sequence for such a simple membrane by employing essentially local changes to curve and
phase ﬁeld. A diagonal sequence then recovers (γ, u).
Throughout this section we assume that (γ, u) ∈ D × Q has ﬁnite energy F(γ, u) and
constant speed |γ(cid:48)| ≡ q in I, without loss of generality q = 1. Since the value of u in {y = 0}
does not enter the energy or our arguments, we assume u = 0 in {y = 0}.

4.3.1 Approximation by simple conﬁgurations

Lemma 4.6. Assume that Mγ has inﬁnitely many components. Then there is a sequence
(γδ, uδ) ∈ D × Q that converges to (γ, u) in C0(I; R2) × L1({y > 0}) as δ → 0 such that
F(γδ, uδ) → F(γ, u) and each Mδ has ﬁnitely many components.
Proof. Since Lγ, Aγ, and |F(γ, u)| are ﬁnite, approximations (γδ, uδ) can be constructed by
replacing all components of (γ, u), whose curve length is less than δ, with a horizontal on the
axis of revolution and phase ﬁeld equal to zero. Convergence of curves and phase ﬁelds as
δ → 0 are easily checked. The energy diﬀerence consists of the total energy of the removed
components and the interface energy of the new horizontals on the axis of revolution. Thus
we have

and both terms on the right hand side converge to 0 as δ → 0. The area diﬀerence satisﬁes

|F(γ, u) − F(γδ, uδ)| ≤ (cid:88)ω:Lγ (ω)≤δ(cid:16)|F(γ, u, ω)| + 2πˆσLγ(ω)(cid:17),
Aγ − Aγδ = 2π (cid:88)ω:Lγ (ω)≤δ(cid:90)ω

|γ(cid:48)|y dt ≤ 2πδ (cid:88)ω:Lγ (ω)≤δ

Lγ(ω) = o(δ),

and it remains to recover the constraints exactly so that (γδ, uδ) is admissible.

First, if there is an interval J (cid:98) {y > 0} \ Sγ ∪ Su such that x(cid:48) > 0 in J, then the
corresponding component belongs to (γδ, uδ) for all suﬃciently small δ > 0 and we can add
a perturbation that is compactly supported in J, tends to zero in W 2,2(J; R2) as δ → 0, and
recovers the area; if necessary, a reparametrisation ﬁxes the constant speed requirement.
If there is no such interval J, then γ consists only of vertical line segments interrupted by
kinks and the area constraint is easily established for Mγδ by adapting the length of two
adjacent line segments.

Second, if there is at least one proper interface without kink in (γ, u) then this interface
also belongs to (γδ, uδ) for all suﬃciently small δ. It can be moved by an order less than
δ and with change in energy of the same order to recover the phase integral constraint. If
(γ, u) contains no proper interface, introducing one or a ﬁnite number of new interfaces at
δ above the axis of revolution and ﬂipping the sign of uδ below
a height of order less than
these new interfaces recovers the constraint. The change in energy contributed by each new
interface is proportional to its height above the axis of revolution and thus vanishes in the
limit δ → 0.

Lemma 4.7. Assume that Mγ has ﬁnitely many components. Then there is a sequence
(γδ, uδ) ∈ D × Q that converges to (γ, u) in C0(I; R2) × L1({y > 0}) as δ → 0 such that
F(γδ, uδ) → F(γ, u) and H0(Sγδ ∪ Suδ ) < ∞. Every component ω = (a, b) of Mγδ meets
the axis of revolution in a line perpendicular to it, that is γ(cid:48)δ = (0, 1) near a in ω and
γ(cid:48)δ = (0,−1) near b. Two adjacent components are connected by a horizontal segment on

the axis of revolution.

Proof. The approximations are constructed by changing (γ, u) in segments of length of order
δ around component boundaries. More precisely, let ω = (a, b) be a component of Mγ and
δ > 0 suﬃciently small so that bδ = b − δ ∈ ω. In (bδ, b] we replace γ by

γδ(t) =(cid:40)(x(bδ), y(bδ) − t + bδ)
(x(bδ) + t − ˆbδ, 0)

if t ∈ (bδ, ˆbδ),
if t ∈ (ˆbδ, b),

that is, we move vertically down until we reach the axis of revolution at ˆbδ = y(bδ) + bδ and
ﬁll the remaining interval (ˆbδ, b] by moving to the right. At the other component boundary
a we do the same but with the horizontal to the left.

Making this replacement for every component, shifting remaining segments of γ slightly
in x-direction to glue all parts together continuously and setting the phase ﬁeld to, say, +1
on the new verticals and 0 on the horizontals we obtain (γδ, uδ) such that γδ → γ in C0(I; R2)
and uδ → u in L1(I). Denoting by Morig all parts of Mγ that have been removed and by
Mhor and Mver the introduced horizontals and verticals, the Helfrich energy diﬀerence is
bounded by

|H(γ, u) − H(γδ, uδ)| ≤(cid:90)Morig
|Hγ − Hs(u)|2 + |Kγ| dµ +(cid:90)Mver
∞µδ(Mver) → 0 as δ → 0, and the ﬁrst tends to 0 as
The second term is bounded by (cid:107)Hs(cid:107)2
δ → 0 due to µ(Morig) → 0 and uniform continuity of the integral. The diﬀerence in the
interface energy consists of original (ghost) interfaces that are omitted in (γδ, uδ), the two
probably introduced kinks for each component, and the new pieces on the axis of revolution.
Therefore, we obtain

Hs(uδ)2 dµδ.

(σ + ˆσ|[γ(cid:48)](s)|)y(s) + 2Nγ(σ + ˆσπ)δ + 2Nγ ˆσδ,

where Nγ denotes the number of components of γ. The ﬁrst term converges to 0 as δ → 0
because the sum over all (ghost) interfaces is ﬁnite, thus the energy diﬀerence vanishes in
the limit δ → 0. Since yδ ≤ y ≤ δ where γ has been replaced, one easily ﬁnds that |Aγ −Aδ|
is of order δ2; thus the constraints can be recovered as in Lemma 4.6.

If necessary, additional minor changes such as adding horizontal segments between ad-

jacent components or removing horizontals at ∂I can be applied.

From now on we assume that (γ, u) has the form of the approximations constructed in
Lemma 4.7. As an example, Figure 4.1 shows an approximation of the curve in Figure 3.1.

4.3.2 Kinks and interfaces
Let s ∈ Sγ be a kink, S = Sγ ∪ Su, and J (cid:98) {y > 0} with J ∩ S = {s}. For simplicity
of notation we formulate the following arguments for curves and phase ﬁelds given in an
interval J around s = 0; recall that |γ(cid:48)| = 1 in J. First we smooth out kinks by a linear
interpolation of the tangent angle of γ around s = 0. This local procedure disturbs the
constraints and disrupts the curve, so that we have to add some corrections, one of which
is a global shift in x-direction because of the requirement x(cid:48) ≥ 0.

parts in grey. Small components are removed and the ends of the remaining components
are replaced by line segments; between two adjacent components there is always a small
horizontal segment on the axis of revolution. The number of (ghost) interfaces is ﬁnite.

W 2,2(J; R2) such that

• γε satisﬁes inf J yε > 0 and x(cid:48)ε ≥ 0;

Proof. Let ϕ be an angle function for γ in J that is uniformly continuous on either side

By construction, ϕε ∈ [−π/2, π/2], that is x(cid:48)ε ≥ 0, and |γ(cid:48)ε| ≡ 1 in J. Also, γε → γ in
W 1,p(J; R2) because ϕε → ϕ in Lp(J) for any p ∈ [1,∞). Therefore, yε ≥ inf J y/2 > 0 for
all suﬃciently small ε.

It remains to correct the y-coordinate of the right end point of γε(J) and to calculate

the error in the area and phase integral constraint. We ﬁx (cid:101)J (cid:98) J \ Jε independently of all
suﬃciently small ε and f ∈ C∞c ((cid:101)J) such that f ≥ 0 and(cid:82)(cid:101)J f dt = 1. The perturbed curve

proﬁle, and the connection to 1.

Next we construct a recovery sequence for the phase ﬁeld in J which is in line with γε
of Lemma 4.8. It is well known, see for instance [1], that in the classical one-dimensional
Modica-Mortola setting the optimal ε-energy proﬁle for a transition of uε from −1 to +1 is
obtained by minimising

among functions u that satisfy u(0) = 0 and u(±∞) = ±1. Indeed, setting uε(t) = u(t/ε),
we ﬁnd

Gε(uε) = G1(u) ≥ 2(cid:90)R(cid:112)W (u)u(cid:48) dt = 2(cid:90)R(cid:112)W (u) du = σ.

Equality holds if and only if

which admits a local solution p with initial condition p(0) = 0 because(cid:112)W (·) is continuous.
Obviously, the constants +1 and −1 are a global super- and sub-solution of (4.9), hence p
can be extended to the whole real line. Since W (p) > 0 for p ∈ (−1, +1), p(t) converges to
±1 as t → ±∞. Thus p(t/ε) minimises Gε, and due to the symmetry of W we may assume
−p(−t) = p(t).

The building block pε of our phase ﬁeld recovery is given by

which connects pε = 0 and pε = 1 by an appropriately scaled optimal proﬁle and a linear

In the following lemma we estimate the interface energy of γε combined with a suitable
phase ﬁeld uε based on pε.
Lemma 4.9. Let γε be as in Lemma 4.8. Then there exists uε ∈ W 1,p(J) such that
(cid:107)uε(cid:107)L∞(J) ≤ C0, uε = u on ∂J, uε → u in Lp(J) for any p ∈ [1,∞), (cid:82)Mε(J) uε dµε =

Proof. If s = 0 is a proper interface let

uε(t) =(cid:40)pε(t)
−pε(−t)

if 0 ≤ t,
if 0 > t,

if u(t) = sign t in J, and the negative of it, if u(t) = − sign t; for a ghost interface take the
combination of pε(t) and pε(−t) or its negative. Obviously, uε → u in Lp(J), |uε| ≤ C0 in
J, and uε = u on ∂J. For the energy estimates we assume u(t) = sign t, the proof of the
other cases works with the obvious changes.

Due to uε ≡ 0 in Jε = (−δε, δε), Lemma 4.8 provides

Iε(γε, uε, Jε) ≤ 2πˆσ|[γ(cid:48)](0)|y(0).

Since γ ∈ W 2,2(J \ {0} ; R2) and γε = γ + o(1) in W 2,2(J \ Jε; R2), the curvature term in
Iε(γε, uε, J \ Jε) vanishes in the limit ε → 0. The other terms are easily estimated by

on the positive side of s = 0, and similarly on the other side. The second term on the right

integral is bounded by σ/2 and the supremum converges to y(0). Hence, taking the limit
superior as ε → 0 proves the upper bound for Iε(γε, uε, J). The estimate for the Helfrich
energy follows from Hε(γε, uε, J) = Hε(γε, uε, J \ Jε), using convergence of uε and γεχJ\Jε.

C0(I; R2) × L1({y > 0}) by combining the local approximations for kinks, interfaces, and

5 Generalisations and open problems

Finally, we discuss some extensions of Theorem 3.4 and open problems. First of all, the
proof is easily adapted to non-symmetric potentials W . In this case one splits σ into two

Kinks in two-phase lipid bilayer membranes

constants

σ+ =(cid:90) 1

0

2(cid:112)W (u) du

and

σ− =(cid:90) 0

−1

2(cid:112)W (u) du

and distinguishes proper interfaces and ghost interfaces in the diﬀerent phases u = ±1 by
the line tensions σ+ + σ−, 2σ+, or 2σ− instead of σ in the limit energy. One may also
consider potentials as W (u) = (1 − u)2 and drop the phase integral constraint. Then there
is only one lipid phase, and uε is merely an auxiliary variable that allows curvature induced
kinks in the limit. As already stated, rigidities other than k± = −k±G = 1 can be considered
as long as the conditions (1.3) hold. Also, the u2 in Hε can be replaced by other continuous
functions that are equal to 0 for u = 0 and 1 for u = ±1.

Without change of the proof, the constraint of prescribed area for the approximate

setting can be relaxed to

0 < inf
γ∈Cε

Aγ ≤ sup
γ∈Cε

Aγ < ∞,

and thus incorporated as penalty term in the energy. The same is true for the phase integral.
Other constraints that change continuously under the convergence proved in Lemma 4.1 can

also be imposed, for instance on the enclosed volume Vγ = π(cid:82)Mγ
The arguments can be adapted to open surfaces of revolution generated by curves γ =
(x, y) : I → R × R>0 with prescribed boundary conditions. Alternatively, a uniform bound
on y derived from an energy like Fε + G, where

x(cid:48)y2 dt.

G(γ) =(cid:90)Mγ (∂I)

dH1 = 2π(cid:88)s∈∂I

y(s),

is suﬃcient, as it still ensures a bound on the curve length [14]; the corresponding limit
F + G models open lipid bilayers with kinks, see for instance [27]. If boundary conditions
for γ(cid:48) are prescribed, then kinks may appear at the boundary in the sense that the tangent
vector of the limit curve diﬀers from the prescribed one and contributes to the limit energy
like a ghost interface.

5.1 Gauss curvature, axis of revolution, and full Γ-limit of Fε
G = k−G; then the Gauss curvature
In the study of membranes it is often assumed that k+
integral in (1.1) is a topological invariant and omitted, see for instance [16]. Therefore it is
desirable to drop the Gauss curvature in Fε and to consider

(cid:98)Fε(γ, u) =(cid:90)Mγ

u2(H − Hs(u))2 dµ + Iε(γ, u).

Since (cid:98)Fε still bounds the ﬁrst variation of Mγ, see Lemma 3.1 and the remark after Lemma

3.2, the arguments for equi-coercivity and the lower bound in bulk and at (ghost) interfaces
still apply. At the axis of revolution we obtain the estimate

ε→0 (cid:90)Mε(R)

lim inf

ε→0 (cid:98)Fε(γε, uε, R) ≥ ˆσ lim inf

(5.1)
in place of (4.7). A subsequence of the measure νε = |Hε|µε converges to some ν in the
sense of ﬁnite Radon measures, thus the right hand side of (5.1) is bounded from below by
ˆσν(R). We would like to connect ν(R) or (5.1) to the limit curve γ, but due to the lack of
good bounds on (γε) in R, we are able to do this only in special situations. If for instance
J ⊂ R is an interval, |γ(cid:48)ε| ≡ qε, x(cid:48)ε ≥ 0, and ϕε an angle function for γε we can use the angle
formulas (2.3), (2.4) and integrate by parts to ﬁnd

int R by such intervals J, we conclude

which does not provide any information about the axis of revolution at all and, as seen
before, cannot be recovered in general.

The following example satisﬁes R = ∂R and shows that ﬁnding the lower bound in int R
is not suﬃcient. Moreover, it highlights the diﬀerence between our limit energies and the

full Γ-limit of Fε and (cid:98)Fε. Let ρ = (xρ, yρ) be a periodic rectangular signal and

γεk (t) = (xk(t), yk(t)) =(cid:18) 0

yρ(kt)/k(cid:19)
εk(cid:19) +(cid:18)xρ(kt)/k2

smoothly to obtain closed surfaces of revolution of prescribed area. Then (cid:98)Fεk (γεk , uεk ) and

for t in some interval J, where εk = c/k, 0 < c (cid:28) 1; see Figure 5.1. Using the constructions
from Section 4.3, it is straightforward to check that (γεk , uεk ) with uεk ≡ 0 can be made ad-
missible by smoothing the kinks, reparametrising for constant speed, and extending γεk (J)
Fεk (γεk , uεk ) are uniformly bounded, and in the limit membrane (γ, u) the segment γεk (J)
collapses to a single point. Hence, if the other segments of γ do not touch the axis of
revolution in the interior, we have R = ∂R. The length of γεk (J) is 2 + 1/k, thus we ﬁnd
lim inf Fεk (γεk , uεk , J) ≥ 4π, but F(γ, u, J) = Lγ(J) = 0. This suggests that Γ-limFε is
not geometric, that is, it is not invariant under reparametrisations.
Recall, on the other hand, that the lower limit of Fε at the axis of revolution is non-
negative. Since changes of (γ, u) ∈ D × Q at the axis of revolution do not aﬀect area or
phase integral, removing segments of (γ, u) at the axis is admissible and only reduces the
limit energies. Minimisers of F and Γ-limFε should thus have no energy at the axis of
revolution at all, and for such membranes the two energies agree.
