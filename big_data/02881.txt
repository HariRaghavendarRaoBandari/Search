Abstract

Magnetic doping is expected to open a band gap at the Dirac point of topological insulators by

breaking time-reversal symmetry and to enable novel topological phases. Epitaxial (Bi1−xMnx)2Se3
is a prototypical magnetic topological insulator with a pronounced surface band gap of ∼ 100 meV.

We show that this gap is neither due to ferromagnetic order in the bulk or at the surface nor to the

local magnetic moment of the Mn, making the system unsuitable for realizing the novel phases. We

further show that Mn doping does not aﬀect the inverted bulk band gap and the system remains

topologically nontrivial. We suggest that strong resonant scattering processes cause the gap at the

Dirac point and support this by the observation of in-gap states using resonant photoemission. Our

ﬁndings establish a novel mechanism for gap opening in topological surface states which challenges

the currently known conditions for topological protection.

The topological surface state (TSS) of the three-dimensional topological insulator (3D

TI) Bi2Se3 forms a Dirac cone in the band dispersion E(k(cid:107)) of electron energy E versus wave

vector component k(cid:107) parallel to the surface [1]. Diﬀerently from graphene, the electron spin

is nondegenerate and locked to k(cid:107), and the Dirac crossing point is protected by time-reversal

symmetry (TRS) against distortions of the system [1, 2]. This stability has been theoretically

investigated demonstrating that nonmagnetic impurities at the surface and in the bulk can

form a resonance in the surface-state density of states (DOS) without opening a band gap
[3–5]. A magnetic ﬁeld breaks TRS lifting the Kramers degeneracy E(k(cid:107),↑) = E(−k(cid:107),↓)
between up (↑) and down (↓) spins, and can open a band gap at the Dirac point [1]. For the
two-dimensional quantum-spin-Hall system HgTe, the eﬀect of a perpendicular magnetic ﬁeld

on the topologically-protected edge state has been demonstrated successfully [6], and similar

eﬀects are expected from magnetic impurities in this system [7]. In subsequent studies on

HgTe, the eﬀect of the magnetic ﬁeld was much smaller, and recently in an inverted electron-

hole bilayer from InAs/GaSb, helical edge states proved robust in perpendicular magnetic

ﬁelds of 8 T [8]. At the surface of a 3D TI, calculations show that magnetic impurities can

open a gap at the Dirac point and exhibit ferromagnetic order with perpendicular anisotropy

mediated by the TSS through Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) exchange coupling

[4, 9, 10].

3D TIs with magnetic impurities have been studied by angle-resolved photoelectron spec-

troscopy (ARPES). The magnetic impurities have been employed in the bulk [11] and at
the surface of Bi2Se3 [10]. For Fe impurities, the opening of large surface band gaps of ∼100
meV was reported in both cases [10, 11]. In a previous work, however, we found that Fe

deposited on Bi2Se3 does not open a gap for a wide range of preparation conditions, reveal-

ing a surprising robustness of the TSS towards magnetic moments [12]. This conclusion also

extends to Gd/Bi2Se3 [13] and Fe/Bi2Te3 [14].

The absence of a surface band gap is consistent with the recent ﬁnding that Fe on Bi2Se3

does not favor a magnetic anisotropy perpendicular to the surface, at least in the dilute limit

[15]. In this respect, bulk impurities in TIs have an advantage over surface impurities in that

ferromagnetic order and perpendicular magnetic anisotropies have been achieved in the bulk

systems [11, 16–20, 23]. Fe incorporated in bulk Bi2Te3 is known to order ferromagnetically
with a Curie temperature (TC) of ∼12 K for concentrations of x = 0.04 showing an easy
axis perpendicular to the base plane [16, 17]. On the other hand, (Bi1−xFex)2Se3 has not

3

been found to be ferromagnetic at temperatures above 2 K [17]. For x = 0.16 and 0.25,

ferromagnetic order was found at 2 K [11]. By ARPES [24], surface-state band gaps in

(Bi1−xFex)2Se3 were reported and assigned to a magnetic origin for Fe concentrations from

x = 0.05 to 0.25 including nonferromagnetic concentrations such as x = 0.12 with a band

gap of 45 meV [11]. These band gaps have been attributed to short-range magnetic order.

Concerning Mn incorporation, bulk (Bi1−xMnx)2Se3 with x = 0.02 has been shown to exhibit

a surface band gap with an occupied width of 7 meV [11], which was suggested as indication

of ferromagnetic order induced by the TSS [11]. However, much larger surface band gaps

were observed for n-doped (Bi1−xMnx)2Se3 ﬁlms [20], where ferromagnetic order of Mn at
the surface was found to be strongly enhanced with TC up to ∼45 K. The ferromagnetic
order resulted in an unusual spin texture of the TSS. The TC at the surface was much higher

than in the bulk [20], which was partially attributed to Mn surface accumulation. A strong

enhancement of the surface TC was also predicted by mean-ﬁeld theory for this system [e.g.,

from 73 K (bulk) to 103 K (surface)] [25]. Magnetically-doped TIs with ferromagnetic order

are important as realizations of novel topological phases. When spin degeneracy is lifted by

the exchange splitting, bulk band inversion can occur selectively for one spin. If also the

Fermi level is in the band gap, as predicted for Cr and Fe in Bi2Se3 [26], this gives rise to

an integer quantized Hall conductance σxy in thin ﬁlms termed the quantized anomalous

Hall eﬀect [7, 26]. This has recently been reported for Cr in (Bi,Sb)2Te3 [27]. When a

perpendicular magnetization breaks TRS at the surface of a bulk TI, the resulting mass

and surface band gap give rise to quantized edge states.

In this case σxy is half-integer

quantized yielding a half quantum Hall eﬀect [28] which can be probed at ferromagnetic

domain boundaries at the surface [29] and leads to exotic topological magnetoelectric eﬀects

such as the point-charge-induced image magnetic monopole [30, 31]. Another topological

phase predicted for magnetically doped Bi2Se3 is the realization of a 3D Weyl fermion system

in which the Dirac-like dispersions become a property of the bulk [32].

Here we present a detailed investigation on the correlation between the TSS and magnetic

properties in the Bi-Mn-Se system, where the magnetic impurity Mn is introduced in the
bulk of ∼0.4 µm thick (Bi1−xMnx)2Se3 epilayers with concentrations up to x = 0.08. By
ARPES we ﬁnd remarkably large band gaps of ∼200 meV persisting up to temperatures
of 300 K far above TC, which is found to be ∼10 K at the surface showing only a limited
enhancement by ≤ 4 K over the bulk TC. We ﬁnd that the magnitude of the band gaps

4

by far exceeds that expected from TRS breaking due to magnetic order. By ARPES from

quantum-well states we exclude that Mn changes the inverted bulk band gap. Using reso-

nant photoemission and ab-initio calculations we conclude that, instead, impurity-induced

resonance states destroy the Dirac point of the TSS. We further support our conclusion by

showing that extremely low bulk concentrations of nonmagnetic In do also open a surface

band gap in Bi2Se3. Our ﬁndings have profound implications for the understanding of the

conditions for topological protection.

RESULTS

Concentration and temperature dependence of surface band gap. Figure 1 shows

Mn-concentration-dependent high-resolution ARPES dispersions of the TSS and bulk va-

lence band (BVB) states of (Bi1−xMnx)2Se3 with x up to 0.08 measured at 12 K and 50

eV photon energy. At this energy, contributions from the bulk-conduction band (BCB) do

not appear due to the dependence of the photoemission transitions on the component of the

electron wave vector perpendicular to the surface k⊥ [24], but the BCB is partially occupied

as data at 21 eV photon energy reveal (Supplementary Fig. 1). The clean Bi2Se3 ﬁlm (Fig.

1a) is n-doped and exhibits a well-resolved Dirac point with high photoemission intensity
at a binding energy of ED∼0.4 eV that is seen as an intense peak in the energy-distribution
curve (EDC) at zero momentum superimposed as red curve on the right-hand side of the

panel. The intact and bright Dirac point marked by a horizontal dashed line in Fig. 1a

demonstrates that the TSS is gapless in Bi2Se3. At larger binding energies, the lower half

of the Dirac cone overlaps with the BVB, which is observed for all (Bi1−xMnx)2Se3 samples

(Figs. 1b-d). Increasing Mn concentration, we ﬁnd a gradual upward shift of the band edges

in energy, revealing a progressive p-type doping (hole doping). Most notably, a surface band

gap opens at the Dirac point with increasing Mn content. In each EDC, the opening of the

gap is also evident from the development of an intensity dip at the binding energy of the

original Dirac point. Thus, the energy separation between the upper Dirac band minimum

and the energy position of the intensity dip is about half of the gap size. Note that the

horizontal dashed lines in Figs. 1b-d highlight the minimum limit of the gap size after tak-

ing into account the contribution from the linewidth broadening to the ARPES spectra (see

Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2). The surface band gap rapidly increases

with Mn content and exceeds 200 meV for x = 0.08. For x = 0.02, the suppression of

5

the Dirac point intensity as compared to the undoped Bi2Se3 ﬁlm indicates the existence

of a small gap. This is consistent with the fact that the TSS dispersion becomes slightly
parabolic and is characterized by an increased eﬀective mass of m∗ ≈ 0.09me for x = 0.02.
This value increases further to ≈ 0.15me for x = 0.08, where me is the free-electron mass.
The observed surface band gaps are similar to those previously reported [20], which

have been attributed to long-range ferromagnetism and TRS breaking of the topologically-

protected surface state [20]. Figures 2a-d show high-resolution ARPES dispersions of the

TSS as well as the normal-emission spectra through the Dirac point at temperatures of 12

and 300 K for x = 0.08 (see also Supplementary Fig. 3). Strikingly, there is no signiﬁcant

change as temperature is raised, and very clearly the band gap in the TSS persists up

to room temperature. Moreover, we ﬁnd a similar behavior for the whole sample series

independently of the Mn content, which challenges the dominant role of ferromagnetic

order in inducing the band gap in the TSS, unless the surface TC is above room temperature.

Bulk and surface magnetism. We begin in Fig. 3 with characterizing the bulk magnetic

properties using superconducting quantum-interference device (SQUID) magnetometry. The

comparison of measurements with in-plane and out-of-plane applied magnetic ﬁeld in Fig.

3a shows that at a temperature of 2 K the bulk easy axis lies in the surface plane. This

holds irrespectively of the Mn concentration. Since the opening of a gap at the Dirac point

requires a magnetization perpendicular to the surface [9], we concentrate in the following on

the out-of-plane component of the magnetization. In the hysteresis loops displayed in Fig. 3b

measured with an out-of-plane applied magnetic ﬁeld at diﬀerent temperatures, we observe

a narrow magnetic hysteresis at 4.2 K, whereas paramagnetic behavior emerges at 7 K once

the ferromagnetic transition has been crossed (inset in Fig. 3b). For a better determination

of TC we present in Fig. 3c modiﬁed Arrott plots according to a 3D Heisenberg ferromagnet,

normalized to the mass of the sample, with exponents β = 0.348 and γ = 1.41, from which

we deduce TC = 5.5 K in the bulk (see also Supplementary Fig. 4). This is well below the

temperature of our ARPES measurements shown in Figs. 1 and 2.

The only remaining possibility that long-range ferromagnetism opens the gap at the Dirac

point is an enhanced surface magnetism with magnetization perpendicular to the surface

[9, 20, 25]. This cannot be veriﬁed directly by the bulk-sensitive SQUID magnetometry.

Therefore, we perform x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) measurements at the Mn

6

L2,3-edges to probe the near-surface ferromagnetic order. The detection by total electron

yield leads to a probing depth in the nanometer range. Figure 4a shows for x = 0.04 the

normalized intensity of the Mn L2,3 absorption edges obtained upon reversal of the photon

helicity at a temperature of 5 K with an out-of-plane applied magnetic ﬁeld of 3 T. The

XMCD diﬀerence spectrum is shown in Fig. 4b, with the normalized XMCD diﬀerence

signal following one part of the out-of-plane hysteresis as a function of the applied magnetic

ﬁeld as inset. The temperature dependence of the XMCD signal measured in remanence (0

T applied magnetic ﬁeld) is presented in Fig. 4c for Mn concentrations of x = 0.04 and 0.08.

This signal is obtained after switching oﬀ an applied magnetic ﬁeld of 5 T perpendicular

to the surface, and represents the remanent XMCD, which is proportional to the remanent

magnetization of the ﬁlm surface. We clearly observe a ferromagnetic Mn component in the

remanent XMCD appearing around 640 eV which becomes increasingly more pronounced

at lower temperatures. The lineshape of the XMCD spectrum is similar to that of Mn

in GaAs [21], indicating a predominant d5 conﬁguration. More speciﬁcally, the lineshape

compares rather well with Mn in Bi2Te3 for which the comparison to an Anderson impurity

model recently gave a superposition of 16% d4, 58% d5 and 26% d6 character [22]. The

ferromagnetic Mn component shows surface ferromagnetic order in the remanent XMCD

only below 10 K for Mn concentrations of x = 0.04 and 0.08 (inset in Fig. 4c). On the

one hand, this result is not inconsistent with the predicted strong surface enhancement of

TC since the enhancement eﬀect vanishes already when chemical potential and Dirac point

diﬀer by 0.2 eV [25]. On the other hand, our XMCD result means that the magnetically

induced gap would have to close above 10 K.

Having established that the bulk and surface magnetic properties of our samples are

very similar, as a next step, we performed ﬁeld-cooling experiments to re-examine the bulk

magnetic properties. Figure 4d shows ﬁeld-cooled SQUID data for an applied magnetic

ﬁeld of 10 mT parallel and perpendicular to the surface plane. Above TC, there is no

preferential orientation of the anisotropy axis perpendicular to the surface. Additional

zero-ﬁeld-cooled SQUID data compare rather well with these results (Supplementary Fig.

5). Further XMCD measurements under an in-plane and out-of-plane applied magnetic

ﬁeld are consistent with the SQUID data and contained in Supplementary Fig. 6. These

XMCD and SQUID results strongly suggest that above TC also short-range static magnetic

order does not play a role at the surface or in the bulk, respectively (see Supplementary

7

Note 2), and that domains with partial or full out-of-plane magnetic order are absent.

We further support this conclusion by additional XMCD measurements carried out by

means of x-ray photoelectron emission microscopy (XMCD-PEEM) at room temperature,
with a lateral resolution of ∼20 nm. Figure 4e shows the XMCD image which due to the
light incidence (16◦ grazing) is sensitve to both in- and out-of-plane components of the
magnetization, with additional data given in Supplementary Figs. 7,8. The XMCD image

displays no magnetic domains at room temperature thus also excluding short-range static

inhomogeneous magnetic order with magnetization partially or fully in or out of the surface

plane, at least within our lateral resolution (see Supplementary Note 3 for details). A

similar conclusion can be drawn regarding out-of-plane magnetic short-range ﬂuctuations

(see discussion in Supplementary Note 4 and Supplementary Fig. 9). All our observations

taken together lead us to the important conclusion that the surface band gap is not due to

magnetism and, thus, the novel topological phases cannot be realized with (Bi1−xMnx)2Se3.

Absence of topological phase transition with concentration. There exists an alter-

native nonmagnetic explanation for the surface band gap. It is in principle possible that

the incorporation of Mn changes the bulk band structure and even reverts the bulk band

inversion, rendering Mn-doped Bi2Se3 topologically trivial. This topological phase transition

with concentration is, e.g., the basis for the HgTe quantum spin Hall insulator [6]. Inter-

estingly, it has been argued that a gap in the TSS can be a precursor of a reversed bulk

band inversion, as discussed for TlBi(S1−xSex)2 [33]. Indium substitution in Bi2Se3 behaves

similarly, and leads to a topological-to-trivial quantum phase transition with an inversion

point between 3% and 7% In in thin ﬁlms [34]. Figure 5 shows that the bulk band gap

stays constant within 4% of its value for 8% Mn incorporation. This statement is possible

because at low photon energies changes in the bulk band gap are traced most precisely from

quantum-well states in normal emission (k(cid:107)=0). The simultaneous quantization of BCB and

BVB is created by surface band bending after adsorption of small amounts of residual gas

[35]. This means that the scenario of reversed bulk band inversion does not hold here.

Another remarkable feature is the measured size of the surface band gap. A perpendicu-

lar magnetic anisotropy has recently been predicted by density-functional theory (DFT) for

Co in Bi2Se3 [36] as well as for 0.25 monolayer Co adsorbed on the surface in substitutional
sites, leading to a surface band gap of ∼ 9 meV [36] which, however, is one order of

8

magnitude smaller than the gaps observed here. For (Bi1−xMnx)2Te3, a surface band gap

of 16 meV has been calculated under the condition of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy

[37]. For Mn in Bi2Se3 at the energetically favored Bi-substitutional sites, an in-plane

magnetic anisotropy is predicted [38]. The size of the gap at the Dirac point is only 4 meV

[38]. Perpendicular anisotropy and ferromagnetic order are absent in our samples at the

temperature of the ARPES measurements.

Role of the local magnetic moment and intercalation scenarios. If the large local

magnetic moment of the Mn is responsible for the measured band gaps via TRS breaking,

the eﬀect should be equal or larger when Mn is deposited directly on the surface. Here we

argue in the following way: If TRS is broken only due to the Mn magnetic moment, we do

not require hybridization to open a gap. By depositing Mn we create a completely diﬀerent

environment for the Mn at the surface, allowing us to understand whether the Mn magnetic

moment is solely responsible for the opening of large surface band gaps via TRS breaking

and, ideally, without hybridization playing a role. Mn is very well suited for such comparison,

as due to the high stability of its half-ﬁlled d5 conﬁguration, its high magnetic moment is to

a large extent independent of the atomic environment and the resulting hybridization. DFT

obtains 4.0 µB for most substitutional sites (except for the hypothetical Se-substitutional

site with still 3.0 µB) and only for interstitial Mn the moment peaks with 5.0 µB [38]. Mn
deposition has been performed at ∼30 K in order to keep the Mn atoms isolated from each
other and on the surface. As the XMCD showed a predominant d5 conﬁguration for Mn

bulk impurities, which is most stable, we can assume the same magnetic moment for Mn

impurities deposited on the surface. Figure 6 shows that a similar p-doping occurs as with

the Mn in the bulk. In another respect, the magnetic moments do not act in a similar way

as in the bulk. Even 30% of a Mn monolayer on Bi2Se3 does not open a band gap at the

Dirac point. This result is similar to what we have observed for Fe on Bi2Se3 [12] and Bi2Te3

[14].

Most recently, the appearance of surface band gaps in ARPES at the Dirac point of the

TSS has been discussed based on diﬀerent mechanisms. One is momentum ﬂuctuations

of the surface Dirac fermions in real space as observed by scanning tunneling microscopy

measurements of Mn-doped Bi2Te3 and Bi2Se3 bulk single crystals [39]. However, these ﬂuc-

tuations amount to 16 meV [39], much less than the present band gaps. Another mechanism

9

is top-layer relaxation, i.e., breaking of the van-der-Waals bond between quintuple layers

during cleavage of bulk crystals as proposed in Ref.

[20]. This would open a gap due to

hybridization of TSS’s through the layer [40] but such an eﬀect does not occur for epitaxial

layers where no sample cleavage is employed for surface preparation.

If such a separation of quintuple layers occurs, it is more likely caused by the Mn.

Principally,

intercalated Mn in the van-der-Waals gaps could separate quintuple layers

electronically although such eﬀect has not been seen in experiments yet. At these new

interfaces TSS’s could form and if they would behave like in ultrathin Bi2Se3 ﬁlms,

they would hybridize and open a band gap [40]. However, band gaps of the order of
∼100 meV would correspond to an unrealistic Mn intercalation pattern grouping three
quintuple layers when compared to the ﬁlms of Ref. [40]. In order to estimate the amount

of Mn intercalation, we have analyzed the change of the bulk lattice constant in our

samples by x-ray diﬀraction (see Supplementary Note 5, Supplementary Figs. 10-13 and
Supplementary Tables 1,2). We ﬁnd that the c-lattice constant increases by ∼ 0.15% for
4% Mn and by ∼ 0.45% for 8% Mn. If we would assume that this is completely due to
an expansion of the van-der-Waals gaps, the interlayer distance would increase by only
∼ 1.8% for 4% Mn and by less than ∼ 5% for 8% Mn. According to DFT, intercalation
of transition metals into the ﬁrst van-der-Waals gap of Bi2Se3 leads to an expansion

between 10 and 20% [41]. New surface-state features can appear inside the bulk band gap

but in order to be split remarkably oﬀ the BVB and BCB edges, expansions between 20

and 50% are required [41].

In addition, we point out that, despite our observation of a

large surface band gap at room temperature, we observe a nearly-zero spin polarization

perpendicular to the surface (Supplementary Fig. 14). The absence of a hedgehog spin

texture pinpoints a non-TRS breaking mechanism underlying the origin of the gap, a fact

which is consistent with our conclusions derived from the magnetic properties. Moreover, it

is understood that we cannot verify a small magnetic band gap opening of few meV as cal-

culated in Refs. 36, 37 because much larger gaps are present in the whole temperature range.

Topological protection beyond the continuum model. As we ﬁnd that neither ferro-

magnetic order in the bulk or at the surface, nor the local magnetic moment of the Mn are

causing the large band gaps that we observe, as we can exclude the nonmagnetic explanation

of a reversal of the bulk band inversion and as we do not ﬁnd suﬃcient indications for the

10

nonmagnetic explanation of surface-state hybridization by van-der-Waals-gap expansion, we

point out a diﬀerent mechanism based on impurity-induced resonance states that locally

destroy the Dirac point.

In fact, recently the treatment of the topological protection in the continuum model [3–5]

has been extended for ﬁnite bulk band gaps [42, 43]. As a result, surface [42] and bulk

impurities [43] can mediate scattering processes via bulk states and the localized impurity-

induced resonance states emerging at and around the Dirac point lead to a local destruction

of the topological protection of the Dirac point. The resulting band gap opening depends

on the resonance energy, impurity strength U as well as spatial location of the impurities

[42, 43]. A typical gap size is of the order of 100 meV [42]. Moreover, the gap does not

rely on a particular magnetic property of the impurity and, therefore, the mechanism should

apply for magnetic impurities as well. The model can also explain the absence of the gap

when Mn impurities are placed on the surface, since bulk-like resonance states do not form

when Mn is placed only on the surface. A deﬁnite assignment, however, requires realistic

electronic structure calculations since a simple atomic Mn d5 conﬁguration does not lead to

states at the Dirac point.

To identify impurity resonances, we calculated for 8% Mn in Bi2Se3 at the Bi-

substitutional sites the corresponding DOS by ab-initio theory. The model structure used in

the calculations is shown in Fig. 7a, where Bi atoms (yellow) acquire Mn character (blue).

The results of the calculation are shown in Fig. 7b, where it is seen that Mn impurity states

(blue) strongly contribute to the total DOS (red) near the BVB maximum. The Mn impu-

rity states in the gap are clearly identiﬁed by assuming ferromagnetic order and subtracting

the minority from majority spin DOS. In experiment, impurity-band states are diﬃcult to

observe as the example of Ga1−xMnxAs teaches [44], where similarly to the present case

impurity states emerge near the BVB maximum. There are, in fact, indications for the

impurity resonances in our data. If we look at the photon-energy dependence from 16 to 21

eV in the ARPES results shown in Supplementary Fig. 15, we see that the surface band gap

is only well deﬁned with respect to the minimum of the upper Dirac cone and consistent for

16–21 eV as well as 50 eV (for 50 eV see Figs. 1,2 where the BCB does not appear). The

lower Dirac cone exhibits despite its two-dimensional nature a photon-energy (wave vector

perpendicular to the surface, k⊥) dependence when Mn is incorporated. The reason for this

diﬀerence is that the lower Dirac cone strongly overlaps with the BVB while the upper Dirac

11

cone does not overlap with the BCB. This can also be seen in Fig. 5, where an apparent
band gap of ∼ 200 meV occurs for 2% Mn at hν = 16 eV. At this small concentration,
such an apparent gap seems to be nearly closed at 18 eV, where the suppression of the

Dirac point intensity and the more parabolic TSS dispersion as compared to the undoped

Bi2Se3 ﬁlm indicates the existence of a small gap, in agreement with the results of Fig. 1.

Note that the minimum band gap in the photon-energy dependence deﬁnes the gap size (see

Supplementary Fig. 16). The minimum gap size observed at low photon energies agrees

well with the one obtained at 50 eV. At 8% Mn, the surface band gap opens at all photon
energies and reaches a minimum of ∼ 200 meV, i.e., it is determined rather unambiguously,
but some intensity appears in the surface band gap. Such intensity also appears in Ref. 20.

The role of the impurity resonance is exactly to couple the TSS to bulk states. This 3D

coupling is naturally diﬀerent for the upper and lower Dirac cone due to the diﬀerent bulk

overlap and thus seen as the photon-energy dependence of the lower half of the Dirac cone.

We applied resonant photoemission which fortunately is comparatively strong for Mn

due to its half-ﬁlled d-shell. Figures 7c,d show for 8% Mn oﬀ-resonant (hν = 48 eV) and

on-resonant photoemission (50 eV) measurements via the Mn 3p core level, focusing on the

region of the surface gap, respectively. The spectra were normalized to the photon ﬂux after

taking into account the photon energy dependence of the photoionization cross sections of

Bi 6p and Se 4p, respectively. Subtracting oﬀ-resonant from on-resonant data allows us to

visualize directly the contribution from impurity resonances in the ARPES spectrum, as

there is enhanced photoemission from d-like Mn states through decay of electrons that are

excited via 3p-3d transitions (Fig. 7e). The diﬀerence spectrum shown in Fig. 7f reveals

the existence of impurity resonances inside the surface band gap and near the valence-

band maximum. The resonances are seen in blue contrast and are marked with arrows,

similar to the calculations shown in Fig. 7b. The unexpectedly strong dispersion of the

resonant states with wave vector k(cid:107) is in qualitative agreement with our one-step model

photoemission calculations (see Supplementary Fig. 17 and Supplementary Note 6), and

additionally supports the physical picture of Mn-induced coupling to the bulk states. We

should emphasize that the Mn d5 conﬁguration conﬁrmed by our XMCD measurements oﬀers

much fewer states in the energy range of the Dirac cone than the other magnetic transition

metals. The fact that already Mn breaks the Dirac cone indicates that the present result is

of general importance for TIs doped with magnetic transition metals.

12

As nonmagnetic control experiment we have chosen thick In-doped Bi2Se3 bulk samples
which give rise to a trivial phase close to ∼ 5% In concentration. Supplementary Fig. 18
shows that a large band gap of the order of ∼ 100 meV appears at the Dirac point already
for a much smaller In concentration, namely 2%, far away from the inversion point of the

topological quantum-phase transition (see Supplementary Note 7 and Supplementary Fig.

19 for more details). In addition, spin-resolved ARPES measurements around k(cid:107) = 0 for

In-doped samples (Supplementary Fig. 14) reveal that the out-of-plane spin polarization is

zero, similarly to the result for the gapped Dirac cone in Mn-doped samples. Interestingly,

the size of the band gap for 2% In is of the same order as the one for 8% Mn whereas no gap

appears for 4% Sn (Supplementary Fig. 18). This indicates that the concentration range

at which the large surface gap develops varies from dopant to dopant. Based on the ideas

proposed recently [42, 43], this might be associated with the impurity-dependent strength

U , regardless whether the dopant is magnetic or not. Our control experiments demonstrate

the existence of a novel mechanism for surface band gap opening which is not directly

connected to long-range or local magnetic properties. Although it is not possible to directly

search for In impurity resonances in the photoemission experiment as there is no resonant

photoemission condition available, we point out for completeness that our conclusion on the

nonmagnetic origin of the surface band gap in Mn-doped Bi2Se3 ﬁlms would not have been

possible unless several ﬁndings in our experiment diﬀered from previous experiments [20].

This refers to the in-plane magnetic anisotropy, the absence of a temperature dependence of

the gap, a much lower TC, no out-of-plane spin polarization at the gapped Dirac point, no

enhanced surface magnetism, a photon-energy dependence of the band gap, and an available

resonant condition via the Mn 3p core level allowing us to directly observe the contribution

from in-gap states.

To summarize, we revealed the opening of large surface band gaps in the TSS of

Mn-doped Bi2Se3 epilayers that strongly increase with increasing Mn content. We ﬁnd

ferromagnetic hysteresis at low temperatures, with the magnetization oriented parallel to

the ﬁlm surface. Magnetic surface enhancement is absent. Even above the ferromagnetic

transition, we observe surface band gaps which are one order of magnitude larger than the

magnetic gaps theoretically predicted and, moreover, they do not show notable temperature

dependence. No indication for a Mn-induced reversal of the bulk band inversion and no

signiﬁcant enhancement of the surface magnetic ordering transition with respect to the

13

bulk are found. Control experiments with nonmagnetic bulk impurities, conducted in
the topological phase, reveal that surface band gaps of the order of ∼100 meV can be
created without magnetic moments. In line with recent theoretical predictions, we conclude

that the band gap opening up to room temperature in Mn-doped ﬁlms is not induced

by ferromagnetic order and that even the presence of magnetic moments is not required.

Our results are important in the context of topological protection and provide strong

circumstantial evidence that Mn-doped Bi2Se3 is not suited for observing the quantized

anomalous Hall eﬀect or the half quantum Hall eﬀect.

METHODS

Sample growth and structural characterization. The samples were grown by

molecular beam epitaxy on (111)-oriented BaF2 substrates at a substrate temperature of
360 ◦C using Bi2Se3, Mn, and Se eﬀusion cells. The Mn concentration was varied between
0 and 8%, and a two-dimensional growth was observed by in situ reﬂection high-energy

electron diﬀraction in all cases (see Supplementary Fig.

20 and Supplementary Note

8). All samples were single phase as indicated by x-ray diﬀraction. After growth and
cooling to room temperature, the ∼0.4 µm thick epilayers were in situ capped by an
amorphous 50 nm thick Se layer, which was desorbed inside the ARPES and XMCD
chambers by carefully annealing at ∼ 230 ◦C for ∼1 h. The Mn concentrations determined
by core-level photoemission were in good agreement with those obtained from energy

dispersive microanalysis (EDX), indicating no signiﬁcant Mn accumulation at the surface

of the samples (see Supplementary Fig. 21 and Supplementary Note 9).

High-resolution and spin-resolved ARPES. Temperature-dependent ARPES mea-

surements were performed at the UE112-PGM2a beamline of BESSY II at pressures
better than 1 · 10−10 mbar using p-polarized undulator radiation. Photoelectrons were
detected with a Scienta R8000 electron energy analyzer and the spin-resolved spectra were

obtained with a Mott-type spin polarimeter coupled to the hemispherical analyzer. For

the spin-resolved measurements of Mn-doped Bi2Se3samples, a magnetic ﬁeld of +0.3 T

was applied perpendicular to the surface plane at 20 K right before the acquisition of
the spectra. Overall resolutions of ARPES measurements were 5 meV (energy) and 0.3 ◦
(angular). Resolutions for spin-resolved ARPES were 80 meV (energy) and 0.75 ◦ (angular).

14

Magnetic characterization. The characterization of the bulk magnetic properties was

done by SQUID magnetometry. The bulk magnetization was recorded as a function of tem-

perature and applied magnetic ﬁeld applied either perpendicular (out-of-plane) or parallel

(in-plane) to the surface of the ﬁlms. The diamagnetic contribution of the BaF2 substrate

was derived from the ﬁeld-dependent magnetization curves at room temperature and

subtracted from all data. The characterization of the surface magnetic properties was done

by XMCD and XMCD-PEEM measurements at the UE46-PGM1 and UE49-PGM1a beam-

lines of BESSY II, respectively. The experiments were performed using circularly-polarized

undulator radiation and under the same pressure conditions as the ARPES measurements.

The XMCD absorption spectra were taken using a high-ﬁeld diﬀractometer as a function

of temperature and applied magnetic ﬁeld, and the XMCD-PEEM measurements were
performed at room temperature and under grazing incidence (16◦) with a lateral resolution
of ∼20 nm.

Theoretical calculations. The one-step model photoemission calculations were performed

using the results of ab-initio theory as an input, and taking into account wave vector and

energy-dependent transition matrix elements. The ab-initio calculations were performed

within the coherent-potential approximation using the KKR program package [45], with

spin-orbit coupling included by solving the four-component Dirac equation.

represent energy-distribution curves (EDCs) obtained in normal emission (k(cid:107)=0). A surface band

gap opens at the Dirac point of the TSS which increases in size with increasing Mn content. The

horizontal white-dashed lines highlight the minimum limit of the gap size after taking into account

the contribution from the linewidth broadening. The opening of the gap leads to an intensity dip

in the EDCs around the energy region of the original Dirac point. For x = 0.02, the suppression

of intensity at the Dirac point and the more parabolic surface-state dispersion are signatures of

a small gap. Besides the increased linewidth broadening due to the Mn impurities, these eﬀects

become more pronounced with increasing Mn content.
