Dynamic structure factor of liquid 4He across the normal-superﬂuid transition

We have carried out a microscopic study of the dynamic structure factor of liquid 4He across
the normal-superﬂuid transition temperature using the path integral Monte Carlo method. The
ill-posed problem of the inverse Laplace transform, from the imaginary-time intermediate scattering
function to the dynamic response, is tackled by stochastic optimization. Our results show a quasi-
particle peak and a small and broad multiphonon contribution. In spite of the lack of strength in the
collective peaks, we clearly identify the rapid dropping of the roton peak amplitude when crossing
the transition temperature Tλ. Other properties such as the static structure factor, static response,
and one-phonon contribution to the response are also calculated at diﬀerent temperatures. The
changes of the phonon-roton spectrum with the temperature are also studied. An overall agreement
with available experimental data is achieved.

INTRODUCTION

The most relevant information on the dynamics of a
quantum liquid is contained in the dynamic structure fac-
tor S(q, ω), which is experimentally measured by means
of inelastic neutron scattering.1 Probably, superﬂuid 4He
has been the most deeply studied system from both the-
ory and experiment and a great deal of information about
it is nowadays accessible.2 For many years, liquid 4He was
the only quantum ﬂuid showing Bose-Einstein conden-
sation and superﬂuidity until the discovery of the fully
Bose-Einstein condensate in 1995.3,4 Therefore, the num-
ber of measures of S(q, ω) at diﬀerent temperatures and
momentum transfer has been continuously growing, with
more reﬁned data along the years.5–10 The emergence
of strong quasi-particle peaks going down the normal-
superﬂuid transition ( Tλ = 2.17 K) has been associated
with the superﬂuidity of the system by application of the
Landau criterium. Much of the interest on the dynamics
of strongly-correlated liquid 4He is then related to the
eﬀects on the dynamics of this second-order λ-transition.
In the limit of zero temperature, the richest and most
accurate microscopic description of the dynamic response
of liquid 4He has been achieved by progressively more
sophisticated correlated basis function (CBF) theory.11
The development of this theory has been stimulated by
the continuous improvement of the experimental reso-
lution in inelastic neutron scattering. Recently, Camp-
bell et al.12 have incorporated three-body ﬂuctuations
in an extended CBF approach and proved a remarkable
improvement of both the excitation spectrum and full
S(q, ω), with features not so clearly seen before and that
are in nice agreement with the most recent experimen-
tal data.13 On the other hand, the most accurate tools
to deal with ground-state properties are the quantum
Monte Carlo (QMC) methods. In the case of bosons as
4He, these methods are able to produce essentially ex-
act results for its equation of state and structure prop-
erties which are in close agreement with experimental
data.14 Importantly, QMC methods are not restricted to

the limit of zero temperature and are equally powerful
to introduce the temperature as a variable through the
sampling of the statistical density matrix, implemented
by the path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) method.15

QMC methods

simulate quantum systems using
imaginary-time dynamics since they are intended for
achieving the lowest-energy state. Therefore, having no
access to real-time evolution one looses the possibility of
getting the dynamic structure factor by a Fourier trans-
form of the intermediate scattering function F (q, t), as it
happens in simulations of classical systems using Molec-
ular Dynamics. Quantum simulations are able to sam-
ple this time-dependent function but in imaginary time
τ , F (q, τ ), and from it to get the dynamic response
through an inverse Laplace transform. But it is well
known that this inverse transform is an ill-posed prob-
lem. This means, at the practical level, that the always
ﬁnite statistical error of QMC data makes impossible to
ﬁnd a unique solution for the dynamic structure factor.
Inverse problems in mathematical physics are a long-
standing topic in which elaborated regularization tech-
niques have been speciﬁcally developed.16 Focusing on
the inversion of QMC data, to extract the dynamic re-
sponse, several methods have been proposed in the last
years. Probably, the most used approach is the Max-
imum Entropy (ME) method which incorporates some
a priori expected behavior through an entropic term.17
This method works quite well if the response is smooth
but it is not able to reproduce responses with well-deﬁned
peaks.
In this respect, other methods have recently
proved to be more eﬃcient than ME. For instance, the
average spectrum method (ASM),18 the stochastic op-
timization method (SOM),19 the method of consistent
constraints (MCC),20 and the genetic inversion via falsi-
ﬁcation of theories (GIFT) method21 have been able to
recover sharp features in S(q, ω) which ME smoothed
out. All those methods are essentially stochastic op-
timization methods using diﬀerent strategies and con-
straints. It is also possible to work out the inverse prob-
lem without stochastic grounds22 by using the Moore-

Penrose pseudoinverse and a Tikhonov regularization.23
Other approaches try to reduce the ill-conditioned char-
acter of this inverse problem by changing the kernel from
the Laplace transform to a Lorentz one.24 Finally, the
computation of complex-time correlation functions has
been recently realized in simple problems and proved to
be able to severely reduce the ill-nature of the Laplace
transform.22

In this paper, we use the PIMC method to estimate
the dynamic response of liquid 4He in a range of tem-
peratures covering the normal-superﬂuid transition at
Tλ = 2.17 K. The inversion method from imaginary
time to energy is carried out via the simulated annealing
method, which is a well-known stochastic multidimen-
sional optimization method widely used in physics and
engineering.25 Our method is rather similar to the GIFT
one21 but changing the genetic algorithm by simulated
annealing. The GIFT method was applied to the study
of the dynamic response of liquid 4He at zero temperature
and proved to work much better than ME, producing a
rather sharp quasi-particle peak and also some structure
at large energies, corresponding to multiparticle excita-
tions.21 The temperature dependence of S(q, ω) has been
much less studied. Apart from a quantum-semiclassical
estimation of the response at high q,26 the only reported
results where obtained by combining PIMC and the ME
method which worked well in the normal phase but not
in the superﬂuid part.27 Therefore, the signiﬁcant eﬀect
of the temperature on the dynamics of the liquid through
the λ transition was lost. We show that the improvement
on the inversion method leads to a signiﬁcantly better de-
scription of S(q, ω) in all the temperature range studied,
with reasonable agreement with experimental data.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. A short
description of the PIMC method and a discussion of the
inversion method used is contained in Sec. II. In Sec. III,
we report the results achieved for the dynamic response,
excitation spectrum, phonon strength and lowest energy-
weighted sum rules across the transition. Finally, the
main conclusions and a summary of the main results are
contained in Sec. IV.

II. METHOD

The thermal density matrix of a quantum system is

given by

which in coordinate representation turns to

h ˆOi = Z dR ρ(R, R; β) O(R) ,

2

(3)

with R = {r1, . . . , rN } for an N -particle system. Deep
in the quantum regime, i.e. at very low temperature, the
estimation of the density matrix for a many-body system
is obviously a hard problem. However, the convolution
property of ˆρ,

ρ(R1, RM+1; β) = Z dR2 . . . dRM

M

Yj=1

ρ(Rj , Rj+1; τ ) ,

(4)
with M an integer and τ = β/M , shows how to build
the density matrix at the desired temperature T from
a product of density matrices at a higher temperature
M T . If the temperature is large enough, one is able to
write accurate approximations for ˆρ and thus the quan-
tum density matrix can be calculated, as stated by the
Trotter formula

e−β( ˆK+ ˆV ) = lim

M→∞(cid:16)e−τ ˆKe−τ ˆV(cid:17)M

.

(5)

In Eq. (5), we have considered a Hamiltonian ˆH = ˆK+ ˆV ,
with ˆK and ˆV the kinetic and potential operators, re-
spectively.
In the limit of high temperature the sys-
tem approaches the classical regime where e−β( ˆK+ ˆV ) =
e−β ˆKe−β ˆV . This factorization, called primitive approx-
imation, is however not accurate enough to simulate a
quantum liquid as 4He because the number of required
terms (beads) M is too large. To make our PIMC sim-
ulations of superﬂuid 4He reliable, we use a fourth-order
time-step (τ ) approximation due to Chin, following the
implementation discussed in Ref. 29. Liquid 4He is a
Bose liquid and thus we need to sample not only particle
positions but permutations among them. To this end, we
use the worm algorithm.30

In the present work, we are mainly interested in calcu-
lating the intermediate scattering function F (q, τ ), de-
ﬁned as

F (q, τ ) =

with ˆρq(τ ) = PN

ator. The function F (q, τ ) is the Laplace transform of
the dynamic structure factor S(q, ω) which satisﬁes the
detailed balance condition,

ˆρ =

,

where β = 1/(kBT ), kB is the Boltzmann constant, and
Z = Tr(e−β ˆH) is the partition function. The knowledge
of ˆρ allows for the calculation of the expected value of
any operator ˆO,

τ ) = F (q, τ ). Therefore, it is necessary to sample this
function only up to β/2 (half of the polymer representing
each particle in PIMC terminology). From the PIMC
simulation, one samples F (q, τ ) at the discrete points in
which the action at temperature T is decomposed (Eq.
4).

In Fig.

1, we show the characteristic behavior of
F (q, τ ) for three diﬀerent q values at T = 1.2 K. These
are monotonously decreasing functions ending at a ﬁnite
value at T /2 which approaches zero when T → 0. The
initial point at τ = 0 corresponds to the zero energy-
weighted sum rule of the dynamic response, which in turn
is the static structure factor at that speciﬁc q value,

m0 = S(q) = Z ∞

−∞

dω S(q, ω) .

(9)

With the PIMC results for F (q, τ ), the next step is to
ﬁnd a reasonable model for S(q, ω) having always in mind
the ill-conditioned nature of this goal. In our scheme, we
assume a step-wise function,

Sm(q, ω) =

Ns

Xi=1

ξi Θ(ω − ωi) Θ(ωi+1 − ω) ,

(10)

with Θ(x) the Heaviside step function, and ξi and Ns
parameters of the model. As our interest relies on the
study of homogeneous translationally invariant systems,
the response functions depend only of the modulus q.
Introducing Sm(q, ω) in Eq. (8), one obtains the corre-

sponding model for the intermediate scattering function,

Fm(q, τ ) =

β − τ (cid:16)e−(β−τ )ωi − e−(β−τ )ωi+1(cid:17)(cid:21)

(11)

Written in this way, the inverse problem is converted
into a multivariate optimization problem which tries to
reproduce the PIMC data with the proposed model, Eq.
11. To this end, we use the simulated annealing method
which relies on a thermodynamic equilibration procedure
from high to low temperature according to a predeﬁned
template schedule.25 The cost function to be minimized
is the quadratic dispersion,

χ2(q) =

Np

Xi=1

[F (q, τi) − Fm(q, τi)]2 ,

(12)

with Np the number of points in which the PIMC estima-
tion of the intermediate scattering function is sampled.
Eventually, one can also introduce as a denominator of
Eq.
(12) the statistical errors coming from the PIMC
simulations. However, we have checked that this is not
aﬀecting so much the ﬁnal result since the size of the
errors is rather independent of τ .

The optimization leading to S(q, ω) is carried out
over a number Nt of independent PIMC calculations of
F (q, τ ). Typically, we work with a population Nt = 24
and for each one we perform a number Na = 100 of inde-
pendent simulated annealing searches. The mean average
of these Na optimizations is our prediction for the dy-
namic response for a given F (q, τ ). We also register the

gives slightly more structure (see inset in Fig. 2). Also,
the eﬀect of selecting the best χ2 models seems to be not
much relevant.

In Fig. 3, we compare the results obtained for the dy-
namic structure factor at T = 1.2 K and saturated vapor
pressure (SVP) with previous results obtained using the
Maximum Entropy (ME) method.27 The ME results are
signiﬁcantly broader, mainly at the lowest q value, and
with only smooth features. This broadening is probably
a result of the entropic prior used in those estimations,
which seems to favor smooth solutions. In the ﬁgure, we
can observe that the position of the ME peak is coinci-
dent with ours but the ME solution lacks of any structure
beyond the quasi-particle peak (see Appendix for addi-
tional comparisons between ME and our stochastic opti-
mization procedure). In our estimation, we do not use
any prior information in the search of optimal reconstruc-
tions and thus it is free from any a priori information ex-
cept that the function is positive deﬁnite for any energy.
Moreover, the simulated annealing optimization leads to
dynamic responses that fulﬁl the energy-weighted sum
rules m0 and m1,

without imposing them as constraints in the cost function
(Eq. 12). Also, the m−1 sum-rule, related to the static
response, is in agreement with experiment (see next Sec-
tion).

mean value of χ2 (Eq. 12) of the Na optimizations. As an
example, the mean value of χ2 in a simulation with data
at T = 1.2 K and q = 1.91 ˚A−1 is 2.19 · 10−5, with mini-
mum and maximum values of 2.37 · 10−6 and 3.80 · 10−4,
respectively. At this same temperature, Np = 41 and
the number of points of the model S(q, ω) (Eq. 11) is
Ns = 150.

With the outcome for the Nt series we have tried dif-
ferent alternatives to get the ﬁnal prediction. We can
take just the statistical mean of the series or a weighted
mean, in which the weight of each function is the in-
verse of its corresponding χ2, to give more relevance to
the best-ﬁtted models. Additionally, we have also tried
to make both of these estimations but selecting the 20%
best functions according to its χ2. In Fig. 2, we plot the
results obtained following these diﬀerent possibilities. All
the results are quite similar, with minor diﬀerences; only
at large energies we can observe that the weighted mean

We have performed PIMC calculations of liquid 4He
following the SVP densities, from T = 0.8 to 4 K. The
interatomic potential is of Aziz type31 and the number of
particles in the simulation box, under periodic boundary
conditions, is N = 64.
In some cases we have used a
larger number of particles (N = 128) without observing
any signiﬁcant change in F (q, τ ). The number of terms
M (Eq. 4) is large enough to eliminate any bias coming
from the path discretization; we used τ = 0.0104 K−1.

We compare our result for the dynamic response in
the superﬂuid phase with experimental data from Ref.
5 in Fig. 4. The theoretical peak is located around an
energy which is very close to the experimental one but
it is still broader than in the experiment. However, the
strength (area) of this peak is in good agreement with the
experimental one, as we will comment later. The quasi-
particle peak disappears in the normal phase, above Tλ,
as we can see in Fig. 5. In this ﬁgure, we compare our
results at T = 4 K with experimental outcomes at the
same T . In this case, we see that both the position of
the peak and its shape is in an overall agreement with
the experiment.

One of the main goals of our study has been the study
of the eﬀect of the temperature on the dynamics of liquid
4He. In Fig. 6, we report results of S(q, ω) in a range

gion of the spectrum, with q = 0.88 ˚A−1. At this low
q value, the behavior with T is not much diﬀerent for
the superﬂuid and normal phases, a feature which is also
observed in neutron scattering data.2 We observe a pro-
gressive broadening of the peak with T which appears
already below Tλ and continues above it. Even at the
highest temperature T = 4 K, we identify a collective
peak corresponding to a sound excitation.2 The main dif-
ference between both regimes is that the quasi-particle
energy below Tλ is nearly independent of T whereas, in
the normal phase, this energy decreases in a monotonous

sponse with T is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent.
In Fig. 7, we
report results of S(q, ω) at q = 1.91 ˚A−1 at diﬀerent
temperatures across Tλ. The most relevant feature is
the drop of the quasi-particle peak for T > Tλ. In the
superﬂuid phase, the peak remains sharp with a nearly
constant energy. Just crossing the transition (in our data
for T ≥ 2.3 K), the peak disappears and only a broad re-
sponse is observed, with an energy that moves slightly
down. According to the Landau criterium the existence
of a roton gap implies a critical velocity larger than zero
and thus a superﬂuid phase. Our PIMC data is consistent

with this picture since we observe as the resulting super-
ﬂuid density, derived from the winding number estimator,
goes to zero at Tλ, in agreement with the disappearance
of the roton excitation in S(q, ω).

Our results for the temperature dependence of the ro-
ton energy ∆(T ) are shown in Fig. 8. For temperatures
T < 1.5 K, ∆(T ) is practically constant around a value
8.60 K, in agreement with experiment.33. For larger tem-
peratures, still in the superﬂuid part, this energy gap
starts to decrease with the largest change around the
transition temperature. For temperatures T > 2.5 K,
the peak vanishes and ∆(T ) ﬂattens but then one really
can not continue speaking about the roton mode. In the
same ﬁgure we report experimental results for the roton
energy in the superﬂuid phase. At same temperature,
our results agree well with the experimental ones which
show some erratic behavior around T ≃ 2 K but com-
patible with a decrease of the roton gap with T . Still
in the same ﬁgure, we report the ﬁt used in Ref. 33,
that is based on the roton-roton interaction derived from
Landau and Khalatnikov theory.34 This law seems to be
right only at the qualitative level, with signiﬁcant devi-
ation with our results and still larger discrepancies with
the experimental values.

The results obtained for S(q, ω) in the present calcu-
lation are summarized in Fig. 9 as a color map in the
momentum-energy plane.
In the superﬂuid phase, the
phonon-roton curve is clearly observed, with the highest
strength of the quasi-particle peak located in the roton
minimum, in agreement with experiment. The multipar-
ticle part above the single-mode peak is also observed but
without any particular structure. At T = 2 K the roton
peak is still observed but some intensity starts to appear

appears much more diﬀuse.

The excitation energy of the collective mode is shown
in Fig. 10 at diﬀerent temperatures. Our results at the
lowest temperatures, T = 0.8 and 1.2 K, are indistin-
guishable within the statistical errors and are in close
agreement with the inelastic neutron scattering data at
T = 1.2 K from Refs. 35 and 36, except at the end of the
spectrum (Pitaevskii plateau). In fact, for q > 2.5 ˚A−1
the dynamic response that we obtain from the recon-
struction of the imaginary-time intermediate scattering
function is rather broad and one can not distinguish the
double peak structure observed in experiments. Also, no-
tice that the energies corresponding to q . 0.5 ˚A−1 are
not accessible in our simulations since our minimum qmin
value is restricted to be 2π/L, with L the length of the
simulation box. At T = 2 K, very close to the superﬂuid
transition temperature, we observe as the energies of the
maxon and roton modes signiﬁcantly decrease whereas
the phonon part is less changed. When the temperature
is above the transition, we can observe that the maxi-
mum of the peaks, now much broader, seem to collapse
again in a common curve around the maxon. Instead, in
the roton it seems that the energy could increase again
at the largest temperature. This latter feature is quite
unexpected and could be a result of our diﬃculty in the
localization of the maximum in a rather broad dynamic
response. The overall description on the evolution of the
phonon-roton spectrum with T is in close agreement with

The static structure factor S(q) is the zero energy-
weighted sum rule of the dynamic response (Eq. 9).
This function can be exactly calculated using the PIMC
method as it is the value of the imaginary-time inter-
mediate scattering function at τ = 0.
In Fig. 11, we
show results of S(q) for the range of analyzed tempera-
tures. The eﬀect of the temperature on the position and
height of the main peak is quite small, in agreement with
the x-ray experimental data from Ref. 37. We observe
a small displacement of the peak to larger q values and
a simultaneous decrease of the height when T increases.
These eﬀects can be mainly associated to the decrease of
the density along SVP when the temperature grows. For
values q . 0.5 ˚A−1 we do not have available data due
to the ﬁnite size of our simulation box. Therefore, we
can not reach the zero momentum value which is related
to the isothermal compressibility χT through the exact
relation

S(q = 0) = ρkBT χT ,

requirement of this condition produces that S(q) starts
to develop a minimum around q ≃ 0.5 ˚A−1 when T in-
creases. Our results also show this feature but for larger
T (∼ 3.6 K) than in experiments (∼ 3 K) due to our lack
of data at low q.

From the dynamic structure factor, we can calculate

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have carried out PIMC calculations of liquid 4He
in a wide range of temperatures across the normal-
superﬂuid transition Tλ to calculate the imaginary-time
intermediate scattering function F (q, τ ). From these
functions one can in principle access to the dynamic
response S(q, ω) through an inverse Laplace transform.
But this is an ill-conditioned problem that can not be
solved to deal with a unique solution. In recent works,21
it has been shown that the use of stochastic optimiza-
tion tools can produce results with a richer structure
than previous attempts relying on the maximum entropy
method.17 We have adopted here the well-known sim-
ulated annealing technique to extract the dynamic re-
sponse, without any a priori bias in the search in order
to get a result as unbiased as possible. In spite of the
lack of any constraint in the cost function, we have veri-
ﬁed that the three lowest energy-weighted sum rules are
satisfactorily satisﬁed giving us some conﬁdence on the
reliability of our algorithm.

The results of the dynamic response are still not
enough sharp in the quasi-particle peaks of the super-
ﬂuid phase but the position of the peaks and the area be-
low them are in nice agreement with experimental data.
Interestingly, our results show clearly the signature of
the transition in the roton peak, whose amplitude drops
rapidly for T > Tλ. The eﬀect of the temperature on
the phonon-roton spectrum, static structure factor, and
static response has been also studied.

The diﬃculties of extending correlated perturbative
approaches to ﬁnite T have lead to a really unexplored
dynamics of superﬂuid liquid 4He, at least from a micro-
scopic approach. With the present work, which can be
considered an extension and improvement of a previous
work based on the maximum entropy method,27 we have
shown that the combination of PIMC and stochastic re-
construction is able to produce a satisfactory description
of the quantum dynamics at ﬁnite temperature. We are
also convinced that in the near future we can improve
even more the present results.
In this respect, one of
the more promising avenues could be the estimation of
complex-time correlation functions, instead of the merely
imaginary ones, which can reduce the ill-posed character
of the inversion problem due to its non-monotonic struc-
ture.22

obtained for χ(q) at temperatures 1.2, 2.0, and 2.5 K.
We observe that at low q the eﬀect of T is negligible
but around the peak, q ≃ 2 ˚A−1, is really large. In the
superﬂuid regime, the height of the peak clearly increases
with T , a feature that has not been reported previously
neither from theory nor from experiment. At T = 2.5 K,
in the normal phase, the main peak decreases again in
agreement with the absence of the roton. In the ﬁgure,
we plot experimental data35,36 at T = 1.2 K which is
close to our result at low q but with less strength in the
peak. Results from QMC at zero temperature from Ref.
21 are in an overall agreement with ours at the lowest T ,
but somehow ours have a slightly higher peak.

The dynamic response of liquid 4He is usually written

as the sum of two terms,

S(q, ω) = S1(q, ω) + Sm(q, ω) ,

(16)

where S1(q, ω) stands for the sharp quasi-particle peak
and Sm(q, ω) includes the contributions from scattering
of more than one phonon (multiphonon part). The in-
tensity (area) below the sharp peak is the function Z(q)
which we report in Fig. 13. Our results are compared
with experimental data at T = 1.2 K from Refs. 35
and 36. As we commented previously, our quasi-particle
peaks are less sharp than the experimental ones due to
the uncertainties in the inversion problem from imagi-
nary time to energy. However, the area below the peak
is not so far from the experimental outcomes. Up to the
maximum of the peak, our results are compatible with
the experimental function. However, our data lead to
a peak with less strength and after that, for larger mo-
menta, our results scatter signiﬁcantly due to the diﬃ-
culties in the determination of the area below the peak.

APPENDIX

In Fig. 3, we have compared results for S(q, ω) derived
from our stochastic optimization method and results re-
ported in Ref. 27 using ME. As the intermediate scatter-
ing function F (q, τ ) used in both estimations is diﬀerent
and used by diﬀerent authors it could happen that the
diﬀerences observed in Fig. 3 were due more to the dif-
ferences between the calculated imaginary-time response
than to the inversion method itself. To clarify this point,
we report in this Appendix results of two additinal com-
parisons.

In Fig. 14, we report results for S(q, ω) at q = 0.62
˚A−1 using our imaginary-time data and stochastic opti-
mization.
In the ﬁgure, we also show the dynamic re-
sponse that we have obtained by applying our inversion
method to the imaginary-time data reported in Ref. 27.
Finally, the ﬁgure also shows the ME results reported in
Ref. 27 but for a slightly diﬀerent q value since results
for q = 0.62 ˚A−1 are not given in that paper. As one can
see, starting from their published data and applying our
method the results compare favorably with our response
S(q, ω). Therefore, the diﬀerent quality of the input data
is so small that no eﬀect is observed.

In order to make a more clear comparison between
both inversion methods we show in Fig. 15 results for
the dynamic response using our data for F (q, τ ). At the
same q value than in Fig. 14, we report results obtainded
with stochastic optimization and using the ME method.
The results are similar to the ones shown in Fig. 14 and
lead to the same conclusion, that is, the ME method gen-
erates smoother functions than our method. This conclu-
sion is in agreement with a similar analysis reported by
Vitali et al.21.
