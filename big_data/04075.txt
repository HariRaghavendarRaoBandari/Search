The aLIGO detection of the black-hole binary GW150914 opened a new era for probing extreme
gravity. Many gravity theories predict the emission of dipole gravitational radiation by binaries.
This is excluded to high accuracy in binary pulsars, but entire classes of theories predict this eﬀect
predominantly (or only) in binaries involving black holes. Joint observations of GW150914-like
systems by aLIGO and eLISA will improve bounds on dipole emission from black-hole binaries by
ﬁve orders of magnitude relative to current constraints, probing extreme gravity with unprecedented
accuracy.

Introduction. The recent advanced LIGO (aLIGO) [1]
observation of gravitational-waves (GWs) heralds the era
of GW astrophysics, which will probe the universe in a
way that is new and complementary to traditional tele-
scopes [2]. The GWs detected were emitted in the late
inspiral, merger, and ringdown of a black-hole (BH) bi-
nary system with (source-frame) masses 36+5−4M(cid:12) and
29+4−4M(cid:12) at a redshift of z = 0.09+0.03−0.04 [3]. While the
existence of GWs had been demonstrated indirectly by
their backreaction on the orbital evolution of binary pul-
sars [4], GW150914 represents the ﬁrst direct detection,
and also provides the most convincing evidence to date
of the very existence of BHs.

With several new detectors coming online in the next
few years, the aLIGO detection is only the beginning.
Advanced Virgo [5] will start its science runs in 2016,
while KAGRA [6] is under construction and the LIGO
India project [7] has been approved. Pulsar timing ar-
rays [8–11] are already observing the nHz GW frequency
window, and ESA’s evolving Laser Interferometer Space
Antenna (eLISA) [12] will target frequencies in the mHz;
the latter two operate in frequency bands complementary
to the 10–103 Hz range probed by terrestrial detectors.
At least some GW sources will likely have electromag-
netic or neutrino/cosmic-ray counterparts, the observa-
tion of which can provide a wealth of additional informa-
tion on their nature, formation, and environment.

An important fact that only became clear with the
aLIGO detection is that sources like GW150914 will not
only be visible in the aLIGO band, but also in the mHz
eLISA band, thus opening the prospect for multi-band
GW astronomy [13] (see also [14]). Indeed, [13] predicts
that from a few to thousands of BH binaries with total
masses ∼ 50–100M(cid:12) will be detected by eLISA in a 5
year mission. These systems inspiral in the eLISA band
for years before chirping out of it and re-appearing to
merge in the aLIGO band, typically after a few weeks.

Observations with eLISA will allow for the measurement
of system parameters before detection with aLIGO. This
may help localize the source in the sky in a timely/more
accurate manner, thus increasing the chances of ﬁnd-
ing an electromagnetic counterpart, and it will also al-
low predicting the coalescence time in the aLIGO band
weeks/months in advance, with errors (cid:46) 10 s [13].

This exciting prospect, however, depends heavily on
whether or not the design of the eLISA detector is dra-
matically descoped, a topic currently under investigation
by ESA (see e.g. [15–18] for investigations of the impact
of diﬀerent designs on eLISA science). Indeed, as high-
lighted in [13], cost-saving measures, such as the decrease
in the number of laser links from six to four, or shortening
the mission duration or the length of the interferometer
arms, may dangerously impact eLISA’s capability to re-
solve GW150914-like binaries.
In this Letter, we show
that an excessive descope of the eLISA conﬁguration –
one that makes the detection of GW150914-like BH bi-
naries impossible – will miss out on an incredible oppor-
tunity to perform a generic test of gravitational theories:
to constrain the existence of BH dipole gravitational ra-
diation to an accuracy that surpasses current constraints
by ﬁve orders of magnitude.

Motion and GW emission in extensions of GR. Theo-
ries of gravity that extend GR typically aﬀect the motion
of bodies and GW emission. Though the details of these
changes to the dynamics depend on the speciﬁc theory,
some common traits can be identiﬁed.
In most theo-
ries, the gravitational ﬁeld is described by a spin-2 met-
ric tensor ﬁeld, and by additional ﬁelds (see e.g. [19] for
a review). As a result of the interaction between mat-
ter and the new ﬁelds, “ﬁfth forces” may arise, which
can in general be both conservative and dissipative. The
latter can be thought of as energy-momentum exchanges
between matter and the new ﬁelds, i.e. the stress-energy
tensor of matter is not generally conserved. For weakly-

gravitating bodies or in regimes of weak gravitational
ﬁelds (like on Earth or in the solar system), modiﬁca-
tions to the dynamics are excluded to high conﬁdence
by particle-physics and gravitational experiments [20].
However, if the additional ﬁelds do not couple to mat-
ter at tree level, then their eﬀect on the motion will be
suppressed, i.e the “weak” equivalence principle – the
universality of free fall in weak-gravity regimes – will be
satisﬁed, and these experimental tests will be passed.

The motion of strongly-gravitating bodies, such as neu-
tron stars (NSs) and BHs, can more easily deviate from
the GR expectation in modiﬁed gravity theories.
In-
deed, an eﬀective coupling between the extra ﬁelds and
matter, even if suppressed at tree level, typically re-
appears at higher perturbative orders. This is because
the extra ﬁelds generally couple non-minimally to the
metric, which in turn is coupled to matter via gravity.
Therefore, when gravity is strong, the non-minimal cou-
pling causes the emergence of (eﬀective) ﬁfth forces and
energy-momentum exchanges between matter and the ex-
tra ﬁelds, thus leading to deviations from the universality
of free fall [21, 22]. These are referred to as violations of
the “strong” equivalence principle, or the “N¨ordtvedt ef-
fect” (especially when referring to accelerations).

A modiﬁcation of the motion of strongly-gravitating
bodies will leave an imprint in the GWs these bodies
emit. In GR, GW emission is predominantly quadrupo-
lar, as monopole and dipole emission are forbidden by
the conservation of the matter stress-energy tensor. In
modiﬁed gravity, however, the matter stress-energy ten-
sor is generally not conserved due to the N¨ordtvedt ef-
fect, thus allowing monopole and dipole emission [20].
Dipole radiation, in particular, is the dominant eﬀect for
quasi-circular binary systems, although its actual pres-
ence and magnitude generally depend on the nature of
the binary components and the modiﬁed theory of grav-
ity in question. In addition to dipole radiation, conserva-
tive modiﬁcations to the dynamics (e.g. to the binary’s
binding energy/Hamiltonian) may also be present, but
they are typically subdominant as they enter at higher
post-Newtonian (PN) order1 [23–25].

Let us sketch how dipole radiation comes about by con-
sidering one of the simplest GR extensions. In “scalar-
tensor” (ST) theories of the Fierz, Jordan, Brans and
Dicke (FJBD) type [26–28], the gravitational interaction
is mediated by the usual spin-2 metric ﬁeld and by a
gravitational scalar ﬁeld. The latter has a standard ki-
netic term in the action (up to a ﬁeld redeﬁnition), is
minimally coupled to matter, and directly coupled to the

1 In the PN approximation, the ﬁeld equations are solved pertur-
batively in the ratio (v/c), v being the binary relative velocity.
Terms suppressed by (v/c)2n relative to the leading order are
said to be of nPN order.

2

Ricci scalar. Because of the standard kinetic term, the
scalar obeys the Klein-Gordon equation, with a source
(due to the coupling to the Ricci scalar in the action)
that depends on the matter stress-energy. Therefore, the
scalar is not excited in globally vacuum spacetimes, and
can only be non-constant because of non-trivial boundary
or initial conditions (e.g. if the scalar ﬁeld is not initially
uniform, in which case it undergoes a transient evolu-
tion before settling to a constant [29], or if cosmological
or non-asymptotically-ﬂat boundary conditions are im-
posed [30, 31]). Therefore, BH spacetimes (isolated or
binary) generally do not excite a scalar ﬁeld (i.e. are said
to have “no hair”) and do not emit dipole radiation in
these theories [32, 33].

Nevertheless, FJBD-like ST theories predict that
dipole emission should be present in binaries involving
at least one NS. This has been historically very impor-
tant, because binary pulsar observations constrain pos-
sible deviations of the orbital period decay away from
the GR prediction to high accuracy. For example, the
double binary pulsar PSR J0737-3039 [34, 35] constrains
δ ≡ |( ˙P /P )non GR − ( ˙P /P )GR|/( ˙P /P )GR (cid:46) 10−2 [36–
38], while the binary pulsar J1141-6545 [39] constrains
δ (cid:46) 6 × 10−4. These observations place very stringent
constraints on several gravitational theories, including
FJBD-like ST ones.

One can easily derive a precise bound on gravita-
tional dipole emission with binary pulsar observations by
parametrizing a dipole ﬂux correction to the GW power
as

˙EGW = ˙EGR

1 + B

(1)

(cid:34)

(cid:19)−1(cid:35)

(cid:18) Gm

r12c2

where ˙EGR is the GR GW ﬂux (given at leading or-
der by the quadrupole formula), m and r12 are the bi-
nary’s total mass and orbital separation, and B is a
theory-dependent parameter that regulates the strength
of the dipole term (e.g. in FJBD-like ST theories, B =
5(∆α)2/96, where ∆α is the diﬀerence between the scalar
charges of the two bodies [33, 40]). Dipole emission is
enhanced (relative to quadrupolar emission) by a fac-
tor (Gm/r12c2)−1, i.e.
it is a -1PN eﬀect that domi-
nates over the GR prediction at large separations (or low
frequencies). Since ˙P /P = −(3/2) ˙EGW/|Eb|, Eb being
the Newtonian binding energy of the binary, one obtains
δ = | ˙EGW/ ˙EGR − 1| = |B|(Gm/r12c2)−1 (cid:46) 10−2. This
leads to the approximate bound |B| (cid:46) 6×10−8 with PSR
0737-3039 [38] and |B| (cid:46) 2× 10−9 with PSR J1141–6545.
Similar bounds follow from other binary pulsar observa-
tions.

These bounds place stringent constraints on several
theories that predict dipole GW emission in the inspi-
ral of binaries involving at least one NS, e.g. numer-
ous FJBD-like ST theories (especially those that pre-
dict spontaneous scalarization for isolated NSs [40–43]),

Lorentz-violating gravity theories [23, 24], or theories
with a MOND-like phenomenology [44]. Binary pulsars,
however, are less eﬃcient at testing theories where dipole
radiation activates late in the inspiral – e.g.
certain
FJBD-like ST theories where NSs do not spontaneously
scalarize in isolation, but undergo “dynamical scalariza-
tion” in close binaries [45–50] –, or theories that predict
dipole emission predominantly (or only) in BH binaries.

Let us focus on the latter case. ST theories more gen-
eral than FJBD-like ones couple the scalar ﬁeld not only
to the Ricci scalar, but also to more general curvature in-
variants such as the Gauss-Bonnet invariant or the Pon-
tryagin density [51, 52]. In these cases, the equation for
the scalar has a source that depends not only on the mat-
ter stress-energy (like in FJBD-like theories) but also on
matter-independent curvature terms. The former typi-
cally induces dipole radiation in NS binaries and follows
from coupling the scalar ﬁeld to the Ricci scalar in the
action, while the latter do not vanish in vacuum, may
induce dipole radiation in BH binaries, and follow from
coupling the scalar to more general curvature invariants.
Therefore, bounds on dipole emission from binary pulsars
and BH binaries are complementary, as they constrain
diﬀerent couplings in the action. As an extreme exam-
ple, one can select these couplings to eliminate dipole
emission from binary pulsars altogether, while retaining
dipole emission from BH binaries. This is the case in
shift-symmetric dilatonic Gauss-Bonnet gravity [51, 53],
where the scalar interacts with the curvature only via a
linear (in the action) coupling to the Gauss-Bonnet in-
variant.

A similar situation is expected in theories with vector
ﬁelds (e.g. Lorentz violating gravity and theories with
a MOND phenomenology) or tensor ﬁelds (i.e. bimet-
ric gravity theories), where the contribution of the ex-
tra ﬁelds does not vanish in vacuum. This causes BHs
to possess extra “hairs” besides the GR ones (mass and
spin) [54–60], leading to dipole emission from BH bina-
ries, at least in principle2. Finally, as mentioned above,
even within FJBD-like ST theories, dipole BH emission
might arise from non-trivial (e.g. cosmological) boundary
conditions. In light of all this, it makes sense to constrain
dipole radiation experimentally without theoretical bias.

Currently, the most stringent constraint on vacuum
dipole radiation follows from the orbital decay rate of
the A0620-00 low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB), a main
sequence star in orbit around a BH. By assuming that the
observed orbital decay is consistent with GR, one obtains
the 1σ constraint |B| < 1.9 × 10−2 [61]. This bound is

2 A rigorous proof of the existence of BH dipole radiation in these
theories is not yet available, as GW emission in the presence of
extra vector and tensor modes is quite involved, c.f. the calcula-
tion in [24] for NS binaries in Lorentz-violating gravity.

sensitive to systematics in the astrophysical model, e.g.
the BH is accreting from the star, hence the orbital decay
rate depends on the mass transfer rate and on the angular
momentum carried away by stellar winds, which are not
known a priori.

Projected constraints on dipole GW emission from BH
binaries. A clean prospect for probing extreme gravity
using GWs emitted by BH binaries is to constrain the
presence of dipole emission. Unfortunately, since aLIGO
only sees BH binaries near merger, the dipole term is
subdominant in the aLIGO band, and thus can only be
weakly constrained [62]. However, if a GW150914-like
BH binary is ﬁrst observed by eLISA and then by aLIGO,
as suggested by [13], dipole emission can be constrained
with exquisite precision.

Let us provide an approximate physical argument for
why this is so.
If GR is correct, the BH binary that
produced GW150914 was emitting at a GW frequency
fGW,i ≈ 0.016 Hz (in the middle of the eLISA band)
If eLISA had been in opera-
5 years before merger.
tion in its best conﬁguration (i.e.
the “classic LISA”
N2A5M5L6 conﬁguration of [15]), it would have mea-
sured the parameters of the system with outstanding ac-
curacy, predicting in particular the time at which the
system would have merged in the aLIGO band to within
5 s. However, if the GR ﬂux is modiﬁed by a dipole
term as in Eq. (1), the binary will coalesce earlier, be-
cause dipole emission will shed additional energy and
angular momentum. To quantify this eﬀect, consider
the evolution of the GW frequency fGW under Eq. (1):
dfGW/dt = −(dfGW/dEb) ˙EGW. One can compute the
time ∆t needed by GW150914 to go from the initial fre-
quency fGW,i to the merger frequency fGW,m ≈ 132 Hz
by integrating (dfGW/dt)−1. By requiring that the diﬀer-
ence |(∆t)GR− (∆t)non GR| be less than an uncertainty of
5 s on the merger time, a joint eLISA-aLIGO observation
of GW150914 would constrain |B| (cid:46) 3 × 10−11.

To check this estimate and compare it to the con-
straints that will be available when eLISA ﬂies, we per-
form a Fisher-matrix analysis to obtain bounds on B. We
use the (quasi-circular, non-spin-precessing) PhenomB
inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform of [63, 64], with the
addition of a single parametrized post-Einsteinian [25,
65, 66] inspiral phase term at −1 PN order (ΨppE =
β(πMf )b/3, with β = −(3/224)η2/5B and b = −7, where
η = m1m2/m2, m = m1 + m2 is the total mass and
M = (m1 + m2)η3/5 is the chirp mass). The parameters
of this model are then (A, φc, tc,M, η, χeﬀ , B), where A
is an overall amplitude, (φc, tc) are the phase and time of
coalescence and χeﬀ is an eﬀective spin parameter. We
have checked that, when constraining a -1PN order ef-
fect, a Fisher analysis with the PhenomB model leads to
results that are very close to those obtained using the
PhenomD model [62, 67].

We take the aLIGO noise curve at design sensitivity
from [68], and that at the time of the GW150914 detec-

tion from [69]. For eLISA, we use sky-averaged, six-link
sensitivity curves, since GW150914-like events will be
considerably more diﬃcult to resolve with four links [13].
We consider a 5 year mission, and allow multiple op-
tions for the arm length (1, 2, or 5 Gm, i.e. A1, A2,
A5) and the low frequency noise (N2 for the expected
LISA Pathﬁnder performance, N1 for a noise ten times
worse) [15]. We assume that the observation is simulta-
neously done by two instruments (either the two indepen-
dent eLISA interferometers, or the aLIGO Hanford and
Livingston sites). To combine aLIGO and eLISA results,
we add the Fisher matrices and then invert the sum to
obtain the variance-covariance matrix [70, 71].

We explore the projected bounds on B with sev-
eral BH binaries. For GW150914-like systems, we con-
sider total masses m = (50, 80, 100)M(cid:12) (as well as
m = 65M(cid:12) for the actual GW150914 event), a mass
ratio q ≡ m1/m2 = 0.8, dimensionless spin parameters
(χ1, χ2) = (0.4, 0.3), and a luminosity distance dL = 400
redshift z ∼ 0.085). For massive BH bi-
Mpc (i.e.
naries, we consider m = (104, 105, 106)M(cid:12), with large
(χ1, χ2) = (0.9, 0.8) spins, mass ratios q = (0.3, 0.8),
and dL = (16, 48) Gpc (i.e. z ∼ 2 and 5). We also
consider extreme/intermediate mass-ratio inspirals (EM-
RIs/IMRIs),
for which we consider individual masses
(10, 105)M(cid:12), (10, 104)M(cid:12), (102, 105)M(cid:12), (103, 105)M(cid:12),
dL = (1, 5) Gpc [z ∼ (0.2, 0.8)], and spins (χ1, χ2) =
(0.5, 0.8) in all cases.

Figure 1 summarizes our 1σ bounds on B. eLISA ob-
servations of GW150914-like systems lead to constraints
typically ﬁve orders of magnitude stronger than the cur-
rent A0620-00 constraints, and six orders of magnitude
stronger than current aLIGO constraints. This is because
when these binaries produce GWs in the eLISA band,
they are widely separated and thus they emit dipole ra-
diation abundantly. For example, 5 years prior to merger
(while in the eLISA band), the GW150914 binary had an
orbital velocity of 0.03 c, which increased to 0.22 c before
entering the aLIGO band at ∼ 10 Hz.

The combined aLIGO-eLISA observations lead to con-
straints that are a factor of 2–3 more stringent than
eLISA observations alone. These combined constraints
are roughly three orders of magnitude worse than the ap-
proximate calculation presented earlier because the lat-
ter does not account for correlations between parameters.
We have indeed veriﬁed that we recover that bound if we
assume that all parameters except β (or equivalently B)
are known exactly, i.e.
if we assume that the variance
on β is simply given by the inverse of the corresponding
diagonal entry of the Fisher matrix.

eLISA observations of massive BH binaries and EM-
RIs/IMRIs would also be able to place constraints on
BH dipole radiation, although these are typically weaker.
How strong these bounds are depends on the orbital sep-
aration (or relative velocity) of these binaries when they
emit GWs in the eLISA band. For example, eLISA will

like BH binaries (stars), massive BH binaries (ﬁlled cir-
cles) and EMRIs/IMRIs (ﬁlled triangles) – as a function
of the instrument – aLIGO at the time of the GW150914

well as joint observations by aLIGO and eLISA/Classic LISA

rent constraint on vacuum dipole radiation from LMXB

of GW150914-like sources leads to the most stringent con-
straints, which are 5 orders of magnitude stronger than cur-
rent bounds.

be sensitive only to the very late inspiral and merger-
ringdown of very massive BH binaries, which is why these
lead to weaker constraints in Fig. 1.

One may wonder whether the projected constraints
discussed above are robust, given that gravity modiﬁca-
tions inducing dipole emission, if present, will typically
change the GW model not only at -1PN order in the
waveform phase, but also at higher PN orders. However,
one can show explicitly [62], at least in FJBD theory, that
these higher order corrections only aﬀect a Fisher anal-
ysis like ours by at most 10%. The addition of a large
number of terms in the GW phase at multiple PN orders
is not only unnecessary, but actually counterproductive
as it dilutes the ability to extract any information from
the signal (as ﬁrst pointed out in [72, 73] and recently
veriﬁed in [67]).

Finally, our constraints are relevant for theories where
the gravity modiﬁcations are not completely screened
on the scale of BH binaries. Indeed, to our knowledge
there is no proposed screening mechanism that can com-
pletely screen gravity modiﬁcations at small scales in
dynamical situations such as those of interest here (see

Curr. aLIGODesgn aLIGON1A1C-N1A1N1A2C-N1A2N1A5C-N1A5N2A1C-N2A1N2A2C-N2A2Classic LISAaLIGO-LISA10-810-710-610-510-410-310-2constraint on |B|A0620-00 LMXBMBHsGW150914GW150914-likeIMRIsEMRIse.g. [44, 74–76] and discussion in [53]). Similarly, we im-
plicitly assume that modiﬁed gravity eﬀects do not ap-
pear suddenly and non-perturbatively at speciﬁc energy
scales/resonances (see e.g. [32, 45–50, 77]).

Conclusion. The realization that GW150914-like BH
binaries could be multi-band GW-astronomy targets for
aLIGO and eLISA opens a unique door to study various
physical mechanisms in extreme-gravity regimes. The
generation of dipole radiation (as well as other poten-
tial eﬀects) can be tested by such joint eLISA-aLIGO
observations with unprecedented precision. This excit-
ing prospect, however, will only materialize if the eLISA
design is not excessively descoped.
