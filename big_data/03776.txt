ABSTRACT
We compare mid–infrared 3.6 and 4.5 µm Warm Spitzer observations for Cepheids in the
Milky Way and the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. Using models, we explore in detail
the eﬀect of the CO rotation–vibration band–head at 4.6 µm on the mid–infrared photom-
etry. We conﬁrm the temperature sensitivity of the CO band–head at 4.6 µm and ﬁnd no
evidence for an eﬀect at 3.6 µm. We compare the ([3.6] − [4.5]) period–colour relations in the
MW, LMC, and SMC. The slopes of the period–colour relations for the three galaxies are in
good agreement, but there is a trend in zero–point with metallicity, with the lowest metallicity
Cepheids having redder mid–IR colours. Finally, we present a colour–[Fe/H] relation based
on published spectroscopic metallicities. This empirical relation, calibrated to the metallicity
system of Genovali et al. (2014), demonstrates that the ([3.6] − [4.5]) colour provides a reli-
able metallicity indicator for Cepheids, with a precision comparable to current spectroscopic
determinations.

1 INTRODUCTION

The mid–infrared has many well-known advantages when applied
to distance-scale measurements for Cepheids. First, at these long
wavelengths, the eﬀects of extinction are dramatically reduced
compared to optical bands (as much as 15 to 20 times smaller
in the mid–infrared, Indebetouw et al. 2005). Second, the intrinsic
width of the mid–infrared period–luminosity (PL) relation is also
reduced, with the dispersion of the LMC PL relation at 3.6 µm
being only ±0.10 mag, compared to ±0.20 mag at the V band
(Scowcroft et al. 2011; Fouqué et al. 2007; Ngeow et al. 2012). Fi-
nally, the mid–infrared bands are located in the Rayleigh–Jeans
tail of the stellar spectrum; thus, the eﬀect of temperature changes
are minimised, such that the mid–infrared light curves are both
lower amplitude (compared to their optical counterparts) and highly
symmetric. In the optical many tens of observations are needed
to suﬃciently sample the ‘sawtooth’ light curve shape. In the
infrared, however, only a handful of observations are required
(Scowcroft et al. 2011, hereafter S11).

The Spitzer Carnegie Chicago Hubble Program (CCHP, P.I.

⋆ E-mail: vs@obs.carnegiescience.edu (VS)

c(cid:13) 2016 The Authors

W. Freedman, PID 60010, Freedman et al. 2011) was designed to
take advantage of these facts, employing mid–infrared 3.6 µm ob-
servations of Cepheids for its recalibration of the Hubble constant
(H0) in the mid–infrared (Freedman et al. 2012). The CCHP has
obtained observations at 3.6 and 4.5 µm from Warm Spitzer, and in
the ﬁrst instance expected to use both of these bands to determine
distances to Cepheids in the Milky Way (MW), Large Magellanic
Cloud (LMC), Local Group and beyond. However, as demonstrated
by Marengo et al. (2010), S11, and Monson et al. (2012, hereafter
M12), the 4.5 µm band is aﬀected by the carbon monoxide (CO)
band–head at 4.6 µm. As we will show in Sections 3 and 4, the
abundance of CO in a Cepheid’s atmosphere is strongly aﬀected
by temperature, which induces opacity variations throughout the
star’s pulsation cycle. This temperature dependent opacity change
is echoed on a population–wide scale, varying as a function of pul-
sation period. The width of the 4.5 µm Cepheid period–luminosity
(PL) relation is intrinsically slightly larger than the 3.6 µm PL
(1.112 mag compared to 1.105 mag) due to this change in opac-
ity. Uncorrected for the metallicity eﬀect, the [4.5] PL relation has
so far been excluded from CCHP Cepheid distance determinations
(see Scowcroft et al. 2013; Rich et al. 2014; Scowcroft et al. 2016,
for examples of the 4.5 µm distance modulus disagreeing with

other distance moduli). The 3.6 µm Cepheid observations, how-
ever, have provided measurements of individual Cepheids precise
to 4.7% in distance, delineating the internal structure of the SMC
(Scowcroft et al. 2016, hereafter S16).

One of the outstanding problems in the study of Cepheids
as distance indicators is the eﬀect of metallicity. There has been
a great deal of debate over the past few decades over the direc-
tion and size of the eﬀect of metallicity on Cepheid magnitudes,
particularly at optical wavelengths, with theoretical and empiri-
cal results often in conﬂict (e.g. Marconi et al. 2010; Groenewegen
2013). Romaniello et al. (2008) give a review of recent measure-
ments of the metallicity parameter γ = δµ/δ log Z. Their summary
demonstrates that a consensus is yet to be reached, with measure-
ments ranging from γ = −0.88 mag dex−1 to γ = +0.05 mag dex−1.
While most empirical measurements of γ tend to ﬁnd negative val-
ues, meaning that the true distance modulus is larger than the one
obtained when neglecting the eﬀect of the metallicity, many theo-
retical estimates of the parameter ﬁnd the opposite. Sandage et al.
(1999) found that the eﬀect of metallicity on the Cepheid dis-
tance modulus changed with wavelength, increasing from γ =
−0.02 mag dex−1 at the B band, to γ = +0.08 mag dex−1 at V and
to γ = 0.10 mag dex−1 in the I band. Alibert et al. (1999) found a
diﬀerent eﬀect in their theory–based study, concluding instead that
the PL slope changed with metallicity.

More recently, Bono et al. (2010) studied the reddening–free
Wesenheit indices constructed from optical and near–IR bands us-
ing pulsation models, ﬁnding that metallicity has a negligible eﬀect
on the log P−WVI and log P−WJK relations, but did signiﬁcantly af-
fect the log P − WBV relation. Marconi et al. (2005) resolved some
of theoretical-empirical discrepancy by including in their models
not only the dependence on the metal abundance but also the eﬀect
of the assumed helium to metal enrichment ratio, ﬁnding a metal-
licity correction trend in agreement with the one based on the spec-
troscopic study by Romaniello et al. (2005). Particularly notable is
the study of Shappee & Stanek (2011), who found a large eﬀect
with γ = −0.80 mag dex−1 using Cepheids in M101. However,
Majaess et al. (2011) demonstrate that a metallicity eﬀect this large
would bring the Cepheid distance of the Magellanic Clouds into
severe disagreement with other distance indicators.

With conﬂicting results from both theory and observation, the
CCHP chose to deal with the eﬀect of metallicity by obtaining data
at the mid–infrared wavelengths probed by Spitzer/IRAC, where
the eﬀects of metallicity were predicted to be smaller. We will show
in this paper, consistent with the results of Marengo et al. (2010),
Scowcroft et al. (2011), and Monson et al. (2012), that this is true
for the observations at 3.6 µm, but not for the 4.5 µm data. However,
as we have one metallicity–free band, one metallicity–dependent
band, and a sub–sample of Cepheids with spectroscopic metallic-
ities compiled by Genovali et al. (2014, hereafter G14), we can in
fact calibrate the metallicity eﬀect at 4.5 µm for the ﬁrst time.

The paper is set out as follows: In Section 2 we describe the
data sources we use for our analysis. In Section 3 we discuss the CO
band–head present in the IRAC 4.5 µm ﬁlter, and the chemical pro-
cesses that are occurring to change the opacity at this wavelength.
Section 4 describes the mid–infrared period–colour (PC) relations
for Cepheids. In Sections 5 and 6 we assess the eﬀect of metallicity
on the mean PC relations, and show that the mid–infrared Cepheid
colour can be used as a robust indicator of metallicity. We present
our conclusions in Section 7.

2 DATA

In this work we bring together the mid–infrared, Warm Spitzer
observations taken by the CCHP (M12; S11; S16), with spectro-
scopic metallicities compiled in G14. Many earlier studies of the
eﬀect of metallicity on Cepheid magnitudes relied on nearby Hii
region abundances as proxies for the average values of metallic-
ities of Cepheid populations (Kennicutt et al. 1998; Macri et al.
2006; Scowcroft et al. 2009). This technique is problematic for
two reasons. First, large numbers of Hii regions are required to
trace galactic metallicity gradients. For example, in their study
of M33, Rosolowsky & Simon (2008) found that the uncertain-
ties in the metallicity gradients are systematically underestimated.
Such underestimation would lead to incorrect inferences about the
metallicity gradient, hence incorrect derivations of γ. Second, the
traditional method of deriving metallicities in Hii regions uses
collisionally excited lines (CEL). These metallicities have been
shown to be poor tracers of stellar abundance (e.g. Stasi´nska 2004;
Simón-Díaz & Stasi´nska 2011; Blanc et al. 2015). The metallicity
measurements in Zaritsky et al. (1994), which have been adopted
as standard in many Cepheid studies, use the CEL technique and
as such do not trace the individual Cepheid metallicities in a mean-
ingful way.

There are, however, individual metallicities available for our
program stars that are better to use for the purposes of our study.
We combine these with high–precision mid–infrared photometry
to study the mid–infrared period–colour relation and its response
to changing metallicity.

The data sources are described below in Sections 2.1 and 2.2.
Our sample is summarised in Table 1; the ﬁrst 10 rows are shown
for information regarding its style and content. The full table is
provided as supplementary material.

2.1 Photometric Data — Spitzer IRAC

The mid–IR data used in this work are from 3.6 and 4.5 µm Warm
Spitzer IRAC observations, taken as part of the CCHP. In this work
we use the photometry of M12 for 37 Milky Way Cepheids, S11
for 85 LMC Cepheids, and S16 for 92 SMC Cepheids. Representa-

tive mid–IR light curves from the CCHP sample are shown in Fig-
ure 1. Each Cepheid is represented by three panels, with the top two
showing the [3.6] and [4.5] data and gloess (Persson et al. 2004)
ﬁtted light curve, and the bottom panel showing the ([3.6] − [4.5])
colour curve.

The Spitzer data were taken such that each Cepheid was ob-
served at 24 (MW and LMC) or 12 (SMC) epochs, designed to be
approximately equally spaced through a single pulsation cycle. For
Cepheids with P ≤ 12 days the observations were randomly taken,
as equally spaced observations over such a short time frame would
be problematic to schedule. This observing strategy gave full cov-
erage of the light and colour variations of the Cepheid through its
pulsation cycle.

The Cepheids in this sample were chosen to be useful for the
CCHP distance scale calibration program. To that end, they are all
isolated (i.e photometrically uncrowded), well studied stars. The
MW sample was chosen to maximise overlap with high precision
independent distance measurements, such as the parallax sample
from Benedict et al. (2007). The LMC sample is focussed on longer
period (P ≥ 6 days) Cepheids as these are the most readily ob-
served in more distant galaxies. The SMC observations were taken
as part of a CCHP follow up program (P.I. B. Madore, PID 70010,
Madore et al. 2010), choosing the most isolated, long period targets
from the sample of previously identiﬁed Cepheids in that galaxy.

2.2 Spectroscopic Data — The Genovali et al. Compilation

We adopt metallicities from the tabulation of G14, which is the
most comprehensive list of Cepheid metallicities derived from
high–resolution spectroscopy for the Milky Way and Magellanic
System. To build this compilation, G14 combined numerous litera-
ture studies, many of which use similar instruments and/or similar
methods. G14 put all of the studies onto the same metallicity sys-
tem by measuring zero–point oﬀsets between diﬀerent studies (see
their section 4.1). While this is not a truly homogeneous sample
(i.e. one taken with the same instrument and analysed identically),
the G14 compilation is the most complete and most homogenised
sample available. Thus, it permits the largest sample of Cepheids
by which to study the eﬀects of metallicity on a star–by–star basis
within the goals of this work. We refer the reader to G14 (tables
2 and 4) and Genovali et al. (2013) (table 2) for the detailed mea-
surements for individual Cepheids in the MW (including the study
originating the measurement). The Magellanic Cloud data is largely
from Romaniello et al. (2008), but we refer the reader to G14 (table
7) for the original data on individual stars. Typical uncertainties on
the [Fe/H] abundances are approximately 0.1 dex.

3 THE CO BAND–HEAD

The presence of a strong CO vibration-rotation band–head sit-
uated at 4.6 µm in stars has been known for many years (for
the ﬁrst discussions of the “COmosphere in late–type stars”, see
Ayres 1994; Wiedemann et al. 1994). The ﬁrst hints of its eﬀects
on the mid–infrared magnitudes and colours of Cepheids were
noted by Marengo et al. (2010), who saw a large dispersion in the
([3.6] − [4.5]) period–colour relation (their ﬁgure 5). They also
showed theoretical models, demonstrating that as a Cepheid pul-
sates, (hence changes temperature) the depth of the CO feature —
squarely situated in the IRAC [4.5] band — would also change
(their ﬁgure 6). However, the Marengo et al. study was limited to
single–phase observations of 29 Galactic Cepheids with a period

MNRAS 000, 1–9 (2016)

range of ∼ 2 to ∼ 42 days. With the advent of Warm Spitzer and
the full–phase CCHP Cepheid observations (examples of which are
given in Fig. 1) we are now able to investigate the time resolved ef-
fect.

3.1 Mechanism for opacity changes at 4.5 µm

Alongside H2, CO is one of the most abundant stellar molecules,
with a high dissociation energy at 11.09 eV (Sauval & Tatum
1984). CO is formed in stellar atmospheres by radiative associa-
tion, via the reaction

C + O → CO + γ

where γ is an emitted photon.

(1)

Destruction by photodissociation is not prevalent in stellar at-
mospheres as self–shielding prevents the UV photons necessary for
dissociation from reaching the molecules. For the temperatures of
Cepheids, typically between 4000 K and 6000 K, the main destruc-
tion mechanism for CO is chemical dissociation, speciﬁcally re-
actions involving the rearrangement of atoms in neutral molecules
(Thi et al. 2005). The most important reaction at these temperatures
is the endothermic reaction

H + CO → C + OH

(2)

which has an activation energy corresponding to 2500 K. The other
signiﬁcant reactions involve the hydrogenation of CO, resulting in
the formation of HCO:

CO + H + M → HCO + M

where M designates a third body, or

CO + H2 + M → HCO + H.

Finally

CO + OH+ → CO2 + H

(3)

(4)

(5)

becomes important if the H2 abundance is not suﬃciently high for
hydrogenation.

The reaction rate coeﬃcients, k, of the processes described
by Equations 1 to 5 depend on temperature, T , via the modiﬁed
Arrhenius equation (Petty et al. 1977)

RT (cid:21) cm3 s−1,

k(T ) = αT β exp(cid:20) −Ea
where α and β are constants, R is the gas constant, and Ea is the
activation energy. With k(T ) for radiative association remaining
approximately constant around 10−16 cm3 s−1, and the dominant
method of destruction (Eqn. 2) ranging between ∼ 10−17 cm3 s−1
at the coolest Cepheid temperatures and ∼ 10−15 cm3 s−1 for the
hottest (Wakelam et al. 2015).

(6)

Each of the reactions in Equations 1 through 5 results in a
change in the amount of CO present in the Cepheid’s atmosphere,
hence a change in opacity of the CO band–head. Figure 2 shows
the cycle of destruction and formation of CO molecules in the at-
mosphere of HV 900 — an LMC Cepheid with a 47.515 day period.
As the Cepheid radius increases, its temperature decreases (with a
slight phase lag), allowing the C and O atoms in the Cepheid’s at-
mosphere to once again form CO. This increase in the amount of
CO in the Cepheid’s atmosphere increases the opacity of the star at
4.6 µm and the surrounding wavelengths, causing a decrease in the
emitted 4.5 µm ﬂux. This causes a ﬂattening in the [4.5] light curve
and induces a variation in the ([3.6] − [4.5]) colour of the Cepheid.
As the star reaches maximum radius, changing from expansion to

[4.5] light curves and the ([3.6] − [4.5]) colour curve. The uncertainties on individual points are comparable to the size of the plotted points in the light curves.

contraction, it begins to heat up again. The increase in temperature
causes the CO molecules to be chemically destroyed once more,
allowing the 4.5 µm radiation to once again escape from the star.
This increase in ﬂux boosts the [4.5] magnitude and once again
varies the ([3.6] − [4.5]) colour.

Plateaus are seen in the mid–IR colour curves for Cepheids
when the maximum temperature is reached. For the hottest Cepheid
temperatures (approximately 6000 K at mean light, see models dis-
cussed in Section 4) destruction of CO is the dominant reaction. At
this point, the variation in ([3.6] − [4.5]) colour saturates, and we
observe the ﬂat–topped colour curves seen in Fig. 2.

3.2 Cepheid Near–IR and Mid–IR Colour Curves

If the 3.6 µm ﬂux were also aﬀected, either by CO or some other
element or molecule, the mid–IR bands would be unsuitable for
Cepheid distance measurements. Fortunately, this is demonstrably
not the case. The near– and mid–infrared colour curves in Fig-
ure 3 illustrate empirically that the CO eﬀect is conﬁned to the
[4.5] magnitudes alone, consistent with predictions from model
atmospheres (Castelli & Kurucz 2003) and template light curves
(Pejcha & Kochanek 2012).

Pejcha & Kochanek (2012) created template Cepheid light
curves in 29 photometric bands between 0.3 and 8.0 µm, using 287
MW, LMC, and SMC Cepheids with P > 10 days. They deﬁne the
eﬀect of temperature at a given wavelength as

where Fi is the ﬂux in ﬁlter i . In this analysis, we adopt the βi values
given in their table 3. We can quantify the expected temperature
eﬀects on a given colour (X − Y) as

∆βx,y = βx − βy

points are Spitzer photometric data from S11, with error bars smaller than
the size of the plotted points. Solid lines are the gloess light curve ﬁts to the
data. The dashed vertical lines show the phase of the minimum and maxi-
mum light of the Cepheid, deﬁned by diﬀerentiation of the [3.6] light curve.
There is a slight phase lag between the min[4.5] and min[3.6]. At maximum
light, the [3.6] light curve ﬂows smoothly, whereas the [4.5] light curve ex-
periences a plateau. This plateau is due to the suppression of 4.5 µm ﬂux by
the CO band–head “turning on”, as is seen in the bottom panel. The shaded
region shows where the 4.5 µm ﬂux is being suppressed, due to the inter-
action between the 4.5 µm photons and the CO molecules in the Cepheid’s
atmosphere. As the star reaches maximum light (hence approaches mini-
mum radius and maximum temperature) the CO is chemically destroyed
and the 4.5 µm photons are once again free to stream out of the star.

curves, ﬁt using gloess. The original data are from Persson et al.
(2004) and S11. First we consider the near–IR colour curves in-
volving J, H and K only (the top two curves on the plot). The
(J − K) curve (orange solid line) shows some temperature variation
that comes from the J band (the shortest wavelength, where tem-
perature has the most signiﬁcant eﬀect, βJ = 2.246 ± 0.005, βK =
1.553 ± 0.005, ∆βJ,K = 0.693 ± 0.007). As we expect, the (H − K)
colour curve (red dashed line), however, is almost completely ﬂat.
This is because we have now entered the region where spectra of
objects of diﬀerent temperatures are parallel (βH = 1.724 ± 0.005,
∆βH,K = 0.171 ± 0.007 hence ∆βH,K < ∆βJ,K), so temperature
changes result in a much smaller colour change.

The blue, solid curve close to zero (centre of the plot) is the
mid–IR ([3.6] − [4.5]) colour curve. The variation of this curve is
the opposite form to the (J −K) curves; i.e. as the (J −K) colour gets
redder, the ([3.6] − [4.5]) colour gets bluer. This is consistent with
the colour change in the IRAC bands being driven by the CO band–
head at 4.6 µm, which theory tells us will show up as a temperature–
opposite feature (β[3.6] = 1.442 ± 0.023, β[4.5] = 1.726 ± 0.020,
hence ∆β = −0.284 ± 0.030). However, this curve is insuﬃcient to
determine if the eﬀect is limited to one ﬁlter or aﬀects both.

Next, we consider the colours involving the near–IR bands and
[3.6]. For (J − [3.6]) (green solid line, bottom of plot) we see that
the colour curve has the same shape as the temperature induced
near–IR curve. As expected, it is not ﬂat. At 3.6 µm two stars of
diﬀerent temperatures will have parallel spectral slopes, but at the
wavelength of the J band they will not, inducing a colour curve in
(J − [3.6]). It has a slightly higher amplitude than the (J − K) curve.
The fact that this curve follows the shape of the pure near–IR colour
curves is the ﬁrst suggestion that CO is not aﬀecting [3.6].

Finally, we examine the (J −[4.5]) colour curve (purple dashed
line, bottom of plot). This curve follows the same temperature vari-
ation that the (J − [3.6]) colour follows, but the amplitude is de-
creased. This behaviour indicates that the temperature sensitivity
in the J band is being directly opposed by the inverse–temperature
eﬀect in the [4.5] band, and conﬁrms that the CO eﬀect on Cepheid
magnitudes is conﬁned to the [4.5] mid–IR band alone.

at 2.3 and 4.6 µm can clearly be seen. The 2.3 µm overtone band–head
falls close to the KS band and does not aﬀect the mid–IR observations.
The 4.6 µm band–head begins in the [4.5] IRAC ﬁler and spreads to longer
wavelengths, having no aﬀect on the [3.6] observations. The depth of the
CO features increase with decreasing temperature, suppressing the ﬂux in
the [4.5] ﬁlter at longer periods. The depth of the features also decreases
when moving from higher to lower metallicity. These eﬀects are echoed in
the colour curves; the amplitude of the colour curves increases with increas-
ing period and metallicity, as is seen in Figure 1.

peratures of Cepheids with periods between ∼ 6 and 100 days, as-
suming the period–temperature relation of Sandage et al. (2004).
As the temperature decreases, the depth of the CO feature in-
creases. This makes the Cepheid appear bluer in its [3.6] − [4.5]
colour. The temperature dependence of the depth of the CO feature
is reﬂected in the Cepheid colour curves as a change in amplitude
with period, such that the cooler, long period Cepheids have larger
amplitude colour curves. This is seen in the colour curves in Fig-
ure 1. Also of note is the change in the depth of the feature with
metallicity. This is discussed in detail in Section 5.

These models also demonstrate the utility of the 3.6 µm ob-
servations for precision distance measurements. It is clear that the
CO feature falls exclusively within the IRAC [4.5] ﬁlter and has
no eﬀect on the [3.6] magnitudes. Similarly, the overtone feature at
2.3 µm, which appears at slightly longer wavelengths than the KS
ﬁlter has no eﬀect on the [3.6] band. The colour curves shown in
Figure 3, are consistent with the models presented in Figure 4, and
we conclude that the IRAC [3.6] band provides an excellent tool
for precision distance measurements.

Figure 5. Period–colour relation for all three galaxies. The short period
plateau is seen in the MW sample, and the long period inversion is in the
Magellanic Cloud samples. The mean period–colour relations of each sam-
ple are clearly oﬀset from one another, with the oﬀsets moving to redder
colours with decreasing metallicity.

4 THE PERIOD–COLOUR RELATION

Given the temperature diﬀerence between the longer and shorter
period Cepheids, and the destruction and formation of CO
molecules in a Cepheid’s atmosphere is strongly temperature de-
pendent, we should expect to see a mid–infrared Cepheid period–
colour relation. Figure 5 shows the period–colour relations for the
Cepheids in the three galaxies. Figure 6 shows model period–
colour relations derived from the ATLAS9 LTE models from
Castelli & Kurucz (2003) combined with the log P − log Teﬀ and
log P − log g relations from Sandage et al. (2004), ﬁtting to their
ﬁgure 3 for log Teﬀ, and adopting their equation 49 for log g. We
adopt the LMC log P − log Teﬀ relation for the SMC as no suitable
relation was found at this metallicity. The three model metallicities
([M/H] = +0.2, −0.5, −1.0) were selected as the closest match to
the average metallicities of the Cepheids in each of our samples.

The Cepheid period–colour relation can be described by sev-
eral features; the main period–colour relation, the short–period
plateau (P < 6 d or log P < 0.8, seen mainly in the Galactic
Cepheids due to the period distributions of our samples), and the
long–period inversion (P > 60 d or log P > 1.8). Each of these
features will now be addressed in turn.

4.1 The Mid–Infrared Period–Colour Relation Between 6

and 60 Days

Between approximately 6 and 60 days (0.8 ≤ log P ≤ 1.8), all
three galaxies exhibit well deﬁned period–colour relations. We per-
formed independent unweighted, least–squares ﬁts to each sample
for PC relations of the form

([3.6] − [4.5]) = a(log P − 1.0) + b.

(9)

The values of a, b and their respective uncertainties for each galaxy
are given in Table 2. The slopes are in good agreement for each of
the galaxies, but with signiﬁcantly diﬀerent intercepts.

For the remaining analysis, we adopt the slope deﬁned by the
LMC sample as it is the most well-deﬁned sample for this period
range, and we reﬁt the PC relations using this ﬁxed slope of −0.09±
0.01 mag.

ble 3.

The PC relations from Equation 10 and Table 3 are plotted in
Figures 5 and 6 as solid coloured lines. It is clear in Figure 6 that
the empirical PC relations are well described by the model relations
in the intermediate period range (10 < P < 60 days). Below 10
days the model PC relations begin to plateau for all samples (as
described in Section 4.2), but there are insuﬃcient data in our LMC
and SMC samples to study this eﬀect in detail between 6 and 10
days. We therefore assume a linear relation between 6 < P < 60
days, consistent with other CCHP works.

4.2 The Short–Period Plateau

The short period MW sample in Figure 5 demonstrate the high tem-
perature eﬀect that is also seen throughout the Cepheid’s pulsation
cycle. At periods below ∼10 days (∼ log P = 1, log Teﬀ = 3.78 K,
Sandage et al. 2004), the period–colour relation appears to ﬂatten
out, in the same way that the mid–IR light curves plateaued at high
temperatures. This is the same mechanism.

At these periods, the temperatures of the Cepheids are such
that rate coeﬃcient of CO destruction is an order of magni-
tude higher than for formation (Wakelam et al. 2015). The CO
molecules are chemically dissociated, and the 4.5 µm ﬂux is not
suppressed. The CO band–head has no eﬀect on Cepheids at these
periods.

This is also seen in Figure 6, which shows model PC relations
derived at metallicities corresponding to the three galaxies. At short
periods, the three PC relations converge to a single plateau. This is
further demonstrated in Figure 4, where at the highest temperatures
temperatures the CO feature is indistinguishable from the contin-
uum. We see the plateau in our MW data, but unfortunately do not
have enough Cepheids in the LMC and SMC samples at short pe-
riod to see the eﬀect at these metallicities.

4.3 The Ultra Long–Period Inversion and the Eﬀects of

Rotation

Ultra long period (ULP) Cepheids (those with periods greater
than approximately 60 days) are infamously not well understood
(Sandage & Tammann 1968; Madore & Freedman 1991). They are
generally excluded from distance scale works as they tend to fall
well below an extrapolation of the mean period–luminosity (PL)
relation for shorter periods, and may even adhere to their own dis-
tinct PL relation (Bird et al. 2009). The deviation of ULP Cepheids
from the mid–infrared PL relation has also been noted in previous
CCHP works (e.g. Scowcroft et al. 2011). There have been sugges-
tions that the ﬂattening of the PL beyond 80 – 100 days may itself
be useful as a standard candle (e.g. Fiorentino et al. 2010, 2013;
Clementini 2011, and references therein), but currently the ULP
PL relation remains uncalibrated.

As can be seen in Figure 5, the inversion of the period–colour
relation at periods greater than 60 days is dramatic. This behaviour
may give us important clues about the evolution of Cepheids.
Anderson et al. (2014) demonstrated that the ratio of the rotation
rate of a Cepheid to the critical rotation rate, ω, which decreases
with increasing mass, is correlated with luminosity, L, such that
a lower ω leads to a lower L. This decrease in rotation leads to
decreased rotational mixing on the main sequence. For the high-
mass stars, modiﬁcation of the CNO abundances by rotational mix-
ing dominates over abundance changes from ﬁrst dredge–up. In
the long-period region the low temperature boosting of CO abun-
dance is counteracted by the lack of CNO enhancement due to di-
minished rotational mixing. In the long period region of Figure 5
(i.e. 1.8 ≤ log P ≤ 2.2), the Cepheids have approximately the
same Teﬀ (as derived from their (V − K) colours; Parsons 1971;
van Belle et al. 1999), so the change in mid–IR colour may plausi-
bly be driven by the changes in CNO surface abundances and log g
driven by decreases in ω with increasing mass. Exacerbating this
eﬀect could be the lack of ﬁrst dredge up for high mass Cepheids,
as proposed by Bono et al. (2000), further diminishing the surface
abundances of CNO. A full investigation of the ultra long period
inversion is beyond the scope of this paper.

period–colour relation has been chosen as ﬁducial, and ∆([3.6] − [4.5]) in-
dicates the deviation in colour from that relation at a given period. The
[Fe/H] values are the spectroscopic values for Cepheids in common with
G14. There is a clear trend of mid–infrared colour with [Fe/H], demonstrat-
ing that the IRAC colour can be used as a reliable metallicity indicator for
Cepheids in nearby galaxies. Y Oph was removed from the MW sample as
its large deviation from the mean PC relation cannot be explained. Remov-
ing this star has a negligible eﬀect on the result.

5 THE EFFECT OF METALLICITY

Figure 5 shows the PC relations for all three galaxies plotted on
the same scale. The three PC relations follow the same slope, and
are systematically oﬀset by approximately the same amount. The
LMC has an average metallicity of approximately half solar, and
the SMC has an average metallicity of approximately one quarter
solar (Russell & Dopita 1992, using a combination of Hii regions
and F supergiants). Figures 5 and 6 suggest that metallicity is the
reason for the oﬀset zero–points.

The simulated spectra summarised in Figures 4 and 6 add fur-
ther weight to this conclusion. Figure 4 shows how the depth of the
CO feature, which corresponds to the amplitude of the colour ef-
fect, changes with metallicity. The empirical PC relations are well
matched by simulated PC relations corresponding to the average
metallicities of the three galaxies in Figure 6. This is further evi-
dence that the oﬀset mid–IR PC relations are due to diﬀerences in
the average metallicity of the host populations.

Rather than consider the galaxies as mono–abundance popu-
lations, we can use the metallicities compiled by G14 to test metal-
licity directly for individual Cepheids. In order to ensure the best
quality calibration of the metallicity eﬀect we only use those stars
which have full phase light curves from Spitzer. The full G14 sam-
ple has a much larger number of MW Cepheids available, but these
do not have full phase coverage by Spitzer at this time. Spectro-
scopic metallicities are available for 33 MW, 20 LMC and 13 SMC
Cepheids in common with our Spitzer sample. Constraining the
sample to Cepheids with periods between 6 and 60 days (the re-
gion where the PC relation is empirically consistent with linear),
our sample reduces to 24, 18 and 10 in the MW, LMC and SMC,
still with enough overlap to quantify the eﬀect of metallicity on the
mid–infrared colour of Cepheids.

In Figure 7, the LMC PC relation is selected as ﬁducial.
∆([3.6] − [4.5]) is deﬁned as the deviation of a point from the mean
LMC PC relation. The [Fe/H] abundances are taken directly from
G14. As Figure 7 shows, there is a clear trend of colour diﬀer-

ence with metallicity, demonstrating that the diﬀerent zero–points
seen in Fig. 5 are due to the diﬀerent average [Fe/H] abundances
of the host galaxies. Figure 8 further emphasises this point, show-
ing now the period–colour relation for only those stars with spec-
troscopic metallicities. Here it can clearly be seen that the three
samples are following oﬀset period–colour relations, following the
trend set down by their average metallicities.

6 MID–IR COLOUR AS A METALLICITY INDICATOR

Figures 5 and 7 demonstrate the theoretical and empirical utility of
the mid–infrared period–colour relations as a metallicity indicator.
For populations of Cepheids, the average metallicity can be esti-
mated by determining the zero–point oﬀset of the PC relation from
the LMC. However, the true power of the mid–infrared colour as a
metallicity indicator is for the individual Cepheids. Very few spec-
troscopic measurements of the metallicities of LMC and SMC (or
more distant) Cepheids currently exist, and they are time consum-
ing to obtain. Using the data shown in Fig. 7, the metallicity of an
individual Cepheid can be obtained using the relation

[Fe/H] = 10.09∆([3.6] − [4.5]) − 0.34,

where

∆([3.6] − [4.5]) = ([3.6] − [4.5])LMC − ([3.6] − [4.5]),

(11)

(12)

([3.6] − [4.5])LMC is the mid–IR colour predicted from the ﬁdu-
cial LMC PC relation deﬁned by Equation 10 and Table 2, and
([3.6] − [4.5]) is the measured mid–IR colour of the Cepheid. This
empirical relationship has a standard deviation of 0.20 dex. The un-
certainties on the MW [Fe/H] abundances range from 0.05 dex to
over 0.25 dex per Cepheid, with the Magellanic Cloud Cepheids
estimated to be subject to an internal uncertainty of ∼ 0.10 dex
(Romaniello et al. 2008).

This relation is deﬁned in terms of the Spitzer IRAC mid–
infrared bands. However, 2018 will see the launch of JWST, which
will supersede Spitzer in terms of mirror size and resolution. JWST
has the potential to observe many thousands of Cepheids in the
MW, Magellanic Clouds, Local Group and beyond using NIRCam
(Burriesci 2005). The NIRCam F356W and F444W bands are ex-
tremely similar to those of IRAC (Gardner et al. 2006), meaning

that the CO band–head that is fundamental to this technique will
still be present in the the longer wavelength ﬁlter. Using the ﬁl-
ter curves available from STScI in November 2015, we recreated
the synthetic PC relations in the JWST NIRCam bands at the aver-
age MW, LMC and MW metallicities. We can predict the NIRCam
equivalent of Equation 11:

[Fe/H] = 10.30∆([F356W] − [F444W]) − 0.19.

(13)

Using the JWST/NIRCam prototype exposure time calculator1 we
predict that we will be able to measure the metallicities of indi-
vidual Cepheids to the same accuracy as presented in this work, in
galaxies as distant as NGC 4258 (7.6 Mpc, Humphreys et al. 2013).
This will be a huge improvement over what is currently achievable
with Spitzer. We will be able to map out the whole Local Group
in the three spatial dimensions using the F356W band, and add the
metallicity dimension using the mid–IR colour. NGC 4258 is a key
galaxy for the Cepheid distance scale as it is home to a megamaser
system which can be used to calculate an accurate and precise geo-
metric distance. This galaxy not only provides an independent cross
check of the Cepheid calibration, but is beyond the Local Group.
This large distance places it in an environment more comparable to
supernova host galaxies, where dynamical eﬀects are less signiﬁ-
cant. A detailed understanding of NGC 4258, including a study of
its metallicity structure, will be important for both Cepheid studies
and cosmology.

7 CONCLUSIONS

The cyclical colour variation and period–mean–colour relation seen
in mid–IR observations of Cepheids is due to the CO band–head at
4.6 µm, which is aligned with the IRAC [4.5] ﬁlter. The variation
in colour of a single Cepheid is due to the CO being chemically
destroyed at high temperatures, and recombining at lower temper-
atures. The same eﬀect is seen in the mean–PC relation, where the
period of a Cepheid in the sample is intrinsically linked to its mean
temperature.

We have discovered that the mid–IR period–colour relation
for Cepheids with 6 ≤ P ≤ 60 d is dependent on metallicity. We
have calibrated this eﬀect, such that the metallicity of an individ-
ual Cepheid in this period range can be predicted via the relation
presented in Eqn. 11, which has a dispersion of 0.20 dex. This is
competitive with the uncertainties on individual Cepheid metallici-
ties in the MW, LMC and SMC. With the advent of JWST, we will
be able to make mid–IR photometric metallicity measurements of
individual Cepheids of this quality out to the distance of NGC 4258
(d = 7.6 Mpc, Humphreys et al. 2013) with ease.

The inversion of the PC relation at long periods is consistent
with a reduction in rotational mixing in high mass Cepheids. This is
consistent with the predictions of Anderson et al. (2014), and pro-
vides further evidence for rotation as a solution to the Cepheid mass
discrepancy, rather than convective core overshooting.

Through the study of Cepheid light curves and synthetic spec-
tra we have conﬁrmed that the temperature dependent eﬀect is con-
ﬁned to the [4.5] Spitzer band, and does not contaminate the [3.6]
band. We conclude that the 3.6 µm period–luminosity relation is
suitable for measuring high precision Cepheid distances.
