ABSTRACT

Recently, Maccone and Pati have given two stronger uncertainty relations based on the sum of variances and one of them
is nontrivial when the quantum state is not an eigenstate of the sum of the observables. We derive a family of weighted
uncertainty relations to provide an optimal lower bound for all situations and remove the restriction on the quantum state.
Generalization to multi-observable cases is also given and an optimal lower bound for the weighted sum of the variances is
obtained in general quantum situation.

Introduction
In Kennard’s formulation1 of Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle2, for any single quantum particle, the product of the uncer-
tainties of the position and momentum measurements is at least half of the Planck constant (see also the work of Weyl3)

Later Robertson4 derived the uncertainty principle for any pair of observables A and B with bounded spectrums:

D A· D B >

2|h[A,B]i|,

(1)

(2)

where D A2 = hA2i−hAi2 is the variance of operator A over the state |y i. Eq. (2) can be derived from a slightly strengthened
inequality, the Schr¨odinger uncertainty relation5

wherebA = A−hAiI and I is the identity operator.
All these inequalities6, 7 can be trivial even if A and B are incompatible on the state of the system |y i, for instance, when
|y i is an eigenstate of either A or B. Despite of this, the variance-based uncertainty relations possess a clear physical meaning
and have variety of applications in the theory of quantum information processing such as entanglement detection8, 9, quantum
spin squeezing10–14, and quantum metrology15–17.
Recently Maccone and Pati have presented two stronger uncertainty relations18 based on the sum of variances and their
inequalities are guaranteed to be nontrivial when |y i is not a common eigenstate of A and B. Though there are many formula-
tions of the uncertainty relation in terms of the sum of entropic quantities19, 20, Maccone and Pati’s relations capture the notion
of incompatibility except when the state is an eigenstate of the sum of the operators. Their ﬁrst relation for the sum of the
variances is

(3)

(4)

D A2 + D B2

> ±ih[A,B]i +|hy |A± iB|y ⊥i|2 := LMP1,

which is valid for any state |y ⊥i orthogonal to the state of the system |y i while the sign should be chosen so that ±ih[A,B]i is
positive. Denote the right-hand (RHS) of Eq. (4) by LMP1. Their second uncertainty relation also provides a nontrivial bound
even if |y i is an eigenstate of A or B:

D A2 + D B2 >

1

2|hy ⊥A+B|A + B|y i|2 := LMP2,

(5)

where |y ⊥A+Bi (cid:181)
(A + B−hA + Bi)|y i) is a state orthogonal to |y i. It is easy to see that the RHS LMP2 of Eq. (5) is nontrivial
unless |y i is an eigenstate of A + B. Moreover, based on the same techniques, Maccone and Pati also obtained an amended

Heisenberg-Robertson inequality:

D AD B > ±

i
2h[A,B]i/(1−

2 | hy |

A
D A ± i

D B|y ⊥i |2),

(6)

which reduces to Heisenberg-Robertson’s uncertainty relation when minimizing the lower bound over |y ⊥i, and the equality
holds at the maximum. The goal of this paper is to give a new method of measuring the uncertainties to remove the restriction
on the bounds such as LMP2.

Actually, both the entropic uncertainty relations and the sum form of variance based uncertainty do not suffer from trivial
bounds. Generalizing Deutsch’s entropic uncertainty relation21, Maassen and Ufﬁnk22 used certain weighted entropic uncer-
tainties to derive a tighter bound. Adopting a similar idea to the uncertainty relations based on R´enyi entropy, we propose a
deformed uncertainty relation to resolve the restriction of Maccone-Pati’s variance based uncertainty relation. i.e. the new
uncertainty relation will provide a nontrivial bound even when the state is an eigenvector of A + B. Moreover, we show that
the original Maccone-Pati’s bound is a singular case in our general uncertainty relation and the usual sum of variances can
be extracted from weighted sum of uncertainties. Our work indicates that it seems unreasonable to assume a priori that ob-
servables A and B have equal contribution to the variance-based sum uncertainty relation. Our family of uncertainty relations
are proved to possess an optimal bound in various situations according to the state of the system. In particular, all previous
important variance-based sum uncertainty relations are special cases of our weighted uncertainty relation.

We remark that there is another approach of measurement uncertainty23, 24 to the uncertainty principle which deals with
joint measurability and measurement-disturbance. Our methods can also be used to generalize the joint measurability, also
known as preparation uncertainty23, and to obtain a tighter bound.

Results
We ﬁrst consider the weighted uncertainty relations based on the sum of variances of two observables, then generalize it into
multi-observable cases. All observables considered in the paper will be assumed to be non-degenerate on a ﬁnite-dimensional
Hilbert space. We will show that our weighted uncertainty relations give optimal lower bounds and all previous important
variance-based sum uncertainty relations are special cases of the new weighted uncertainty relation.
Theorem 1 For arbitrary observables A, B and any positive number l , we have the following weighted uncertainty relation:

(1 + l )D A2 + (1 + l −1)D B2 >− 2ih[A,B]i +|hy |(A− iB)|y ⊥1 i|2 + l −1|hy |(l A− iB)|y ⊥2 i|2 := L1,

(7)

ensure the RHS is positive.

The equality condition for Eq. (7) holds if and only if |y ⊥1 i (cid:181)

which is valid for all |y ⊥1 i and |y ⊥2 i orthogonal to |y i. If −2ih[A,B]i is negative then one changes the sign in Eq. (7) to
(l bA + ibB)|y i. Denote the RHS
of Eq. (7) by L1. Clearly LMP1 as a special case of L1, as liml →1L1 = LMP1. When l varies, one obtains a family of
uncertainty relations and the lower bounds L1 provide inﬁnitely many uncertainty relations with weighted contributions for
measurements A and B. This will be advantageous when the ratio hAi/hBi is not close to 1.

(bA + ibB)|y i while |y ⊥2 i (cid:181)

See Methods for a proof of Theorem 1.

Theorem 2 For arbitrary observables A, B and any positive l , we have the following weighted uncertainty relation:

(1 + l )D A2 + (1 + l −1)D B2 > |hy |A + B|y ⊥A+Bi|2 + l −1|hy |(l A− B)|y ⊥i|2 := L2,

(8)

where the equality holds if and only if |y ⊥i (cid:181)
Denote the RHS of Eq. (8) by L2. Note that the lower bound L2 is a nontrivial generalization of LMP2, as the latter is
a proper bound unless |y i is an eigenstate of A + B. Even when |y i is an eigenstate of A + B, the new uncertainty bound
L2 is also nonzero except for l = −1 (Eq. (8) still holds for any nonzero real l ). This means that in almost all cases the
lower bound provided by Eq. (8) is better except for l
6= −1 and it compensates for the incompatibility of the observables.
Obviously the bound LMP2 is a special case of L2 by canceling |hy |(l A− B)|y ⊥i|2 when l = 1.

See Methods for a proof of Theorem 2.
Both lower bounds of the weighted uncertainty relations can be combined in a single uncertainty relation for the sum of

Theorems 1 and 2 provide a strengthened uncertainty relation and remove the limitation of the Maccone-Pati bounds. In

fact, in the case when |y i is an eigenstate of A or B, both Heisenberg-Robertson’s and Schr¨odinger’s uncertainty relations are
trivial, nevertheless our lower bound remains nonzero unless |y i is a common eigenstate of A and B, but this is essentially
equivalent to the classical situation. It is also easy to see that if |y i is an eigenstate of A± iB, |hy |A± iB|y ⊥i|2 in LMP1 will
vanish while the term |hy |(A− iB)|y ⊥1 i|2 + l −1|hy |(l A− iB)|y ⊥2 i|2 in L1 is still nonzero unless l = 1. Moreover, LMP2
will become null when |y i is an eigenstate of A + B, but at the same time L2 is still nontrivial.

Besides having a nontrivial bound in almost all cases, our weighted uncertainty relations can also lead to a tighter bound
for the sum of variances. We give an algorithm to extract the usual uncertainty relation when one of Maccone-Pati’s relations
becomes trivial. Choose two l i: l 1 > 1 > l 2 > 0 and enter our uncertainty relations Eq. (7). Denote bi = (1 + l i)D A2 + (1 +

which always provides a nontrivial lower bound for the sum of variances even when the state is an eigenvector of A + B. This
clearly shows that the weighted uncertainty relations can help recover the uncertainties and remove the restriction placed in
Maccone-Pati’s uncertainty relation. Furthermore, taking the limit of l i → 1 one has that for k = 1,2

For simplicity we refer to the RHS of Eq. (10) or the derived bound in Eq. (11) as our lower bound of the sum of variances,
which usually is a multiple of our bound from the weighted sum (see FIG. 1). In FIG 1 one will see that our bound 1

derived in Eq. (11) is always tighter than the Maccone-Pati bound LMP2. In Eq. (14) we will use another method to show that
our bound is tighter than Maccone-Pati’s bound.

The bound L2 = L2(l ) is a function of l . To analyze when L2(l ) best approximates (1 + l )D A2 + (1 + l −1)D B2,
we deﬁne the error function f (l ) = (1 + l )D A2 + (1 + l −1)D B2 − L2(l ). At an extremal point l 0, the bound L2(l ) is
closest to the weighted sum and one of the following two conditions must hold. Either f ′(l 0) does not exist or f ′(l 0) =
2(1) = D A2 − D B2, then l = 1 is the extremal point and we call it an equilibrium point of

while f ′(l ) = −l −2 sin2 q < 0, hence f (1) > f (l ),∀l > 1 (for ﬁxed q ). So for this |y i, Jy and Jz never contribute equally to
the uncertainty relation, which explains the need for a weighted uncertainty relation. FIG. 3 shows the error function f (l ) and
L2(l ). In general f is a function of both l and q , ﬁnding its extremal points involves a PDE equation. For higher dimension
quantum states or multi-operator cases, the situation is more complicated.

increases, which means that better estimation may be obtained

In general, all variance-based sum uncertainty relations can mix in weights to provide an optimal lower bound. To compare
the variance-based sum uncertainty relation with weighted uncertainty relation, take the lower bound L2 for a more detailed
analysis: set l = 1 then D A2 + D B2 > 1
2|hy |(A− B)|y ⊥i|2, it is not only a typical variance-based sum
uncertainty relation, but also provides a better lower bound than Maccone-Pati’s lower bound LMP2. Moreover, this lower
bound can be further improved by a mixture of weights.

We now generalize the weighted uncertainty relations to multi-operator cases. To emphasize our point, we recall the trivial

generalization from Maccone-Pati’s lower bound.

See Methods for a proof of Lemma 1.

Notice that |y i can be an eigenstate of (cid:229)

Ai without being that of any Ai, in which case the lower bound is still trivial.
However, the bound is not optimal and sometimes becomes trivial when the observables are incompatible in the general
situation. We now introduce generalized weighted uncertainty relations to deal with these drawbacks.

|y ⊥S i = (S−hSi)|y i/D S. We can select suitable l i such that max(Li j, L0) is nontrivial. They are zero if and only if |y i is

a common eigenstate of all observables, which happens only when the system is equivalent to the classical situation. In this
sense our weighted uncertainty relation can handle all possible quantum situations.

If two or more terms in the RHS of these equality are replaced by the Cauchy-Schwarz’s inequality simultaneously, the
corresponding lower bound can not be bigger than the one by replacing just one term. In other words, max(Li j, L0) is better
than the lower bounds by changing more than one term. The LHS of Eq. (20) has only positive coefﬁcients since l i are
positive.

Discussions
There are several physical motivations and mathematical considerations behind our method. First, to remove the restriction
of one of Macconne-Pati’s uncertainty relations (i.e. when y
is an eigenstate of A + B) and recover the lower bound for
D 2(A) + D 2(B), we consider a perturbation of A and B, or rather, A′ = √1 + l A, B′ = √1 + l −1B (l > 0). Then

D 2(A′) + D 2(B′) = (1 + l )D 2(A) + (1 + l −1)D 2(B).

(21)

This means that the lower bound of the sum of variances can be obtained by scaled observables. Actually with the given
measurement data of the variances, it is easy to compute the lower bound using our new formula. This is in line with the
general strategy of perturbation method, just as many singular properties can be better studied through deformation.

Secondly, the idea of the weighted sum or average is similar to well-known techniques used in both statistical mechanics
and mathematical physics. Through the weighted averages one may know better about the whole picture in an unbiased way.
Thirdly, the weighted sum is actually a q-deformation of the original sum of variances. In fact, the sum 2D 2(A) + 2D 2(B)

is deformed to

[2]l 1/2D 2(A) + [2]l −1/2D 2(B),

where [2] = l 1/2 + l −1/2 is the quantum integer of 2 used widely in quantum groups, Yang-Baxter equations, and quantum
integrable systems or statistical mechanics. The opposite phase factors l ±1/2 in front of the variances reﬂect a balance of the
weighted distribution.

Last but not the least, the usual sum of variances can be solved from our weighted sums (see Eqs. (10-11)), and the
derived bound is proved to be tighter than the original Maccone-Pati’s bound. Noted that, there is another result connect with
uncertainty relations in terms of weighted sums of variances, for more detail, see29.

Conclusions
The Heisenberg-Robertson and Schr¨odinger uncertainty relations have been skillfully generalized by Maccone and Pati in

order to capture the concept of incompatibility of the observables A and B on the quantum system |y i. Although other
generalizations of Maccone-Pati’s relations have been considered30 by reﬁning the RHS, our generalization provides a non-
trivial lower bound in all quantum situations. One of Maccone-Pati’s relations becomes trivial when |y i is an eigenstate of
A + B. To remove the restriction of their relation, we have proposed a weighted uncertainty relation to obtain a better lower
bound for the sum of the variances. The parametric uncertainty relations form a family of Bohr-type inequalities and take into
account of individual contribution from the observables so that they are nontrivial in almost all cases except when |y i is a

common eigenstate of all observables. In particular, Maccone-Pati’s uncertainty relations are special cases of our deformed
weighted uncertainty relations. Furthermore, we have shown that the sum of variances can be extracted from our weighted
sums and our derived bound is always tighter than Maccone-Pati bound LMP2 (see discussion before Eq. (11)). We have
also derived weighted uncertainty relations for multi-observables and the lower bound has been proved to be optimal in all
quantum cases.

Methods
Proof of Theorem 1 We start by recalling the parallelogram law in Hilbert space. Let A and B be two observables and |y i a

ﬁxed quantum state. One has that

is a nonzero real number and a ∈ C with modulus one. In fact, the identity can be easily veriﬁed by expanding
D (A− a B)2 and l −1D (l A + a B)2 using D (A)2 = hy |bA2|y i.
We now derive the weighted uncertainty relation in the form (1 + l )D A2 + (1 + l −1)D B2. Since k (bA − ibB)|y i k2=
−2ih[A,B]i+ k (bA + ibB)|y i k2, combine with Cauchy-Schwarz inequality completes the proof.
Proof of Theorem 2 If we set a = −1 in Eq. (23), then we get the result directly.

2D A2 + 2D B2 =k (bA + a bB)|y i k2 + k (bA− a bB)|y i k2,

for any |a | = 1. Since D (A + B) =k (bA +bB)|y i k, D (A− B) =k (bA−bB)|y i k, we can obtain Eq. (4) when a = ±i and Eq. (5)
when a = 1. Note that LMP2 may be zero even if A and B are incompatible. For example this happens if |y i is an eigenstate
of A + B. Our idea is to consider a perturbation of A + B, or A and B to ﬁx this. We consider the generalized parallelogram law
in Hilbert space in the following form:

Proof of Corollary 1 For l > 0, set A′ = √1 + l A,B′ = √1 + l −1B (see Eq. (21)), so

where the RHS L2(l ,A′ ,B′ ) satisﬁes that supl L2(l ,A′ ,B′ ) > L2(1,A′,B′ ) which implies that the weighted uncertainty
relation is better than the ordinary sum: (D A′ )2 + (D B′)2 > supl L2(l ,A′ ,B′ ) > L2(1,A′,B′). Followed by parameter trans-
formation, we get Eq. (14).
Proof of Theorem 4 For arbitrary weighted uncertainty relation xD A2 + yD B2, denote f (x,y) = x+y

xy > 0, then

xD A2 + yD B2 =

f (x,y)

[ f (x,y)xD A2 + f (x,y)yD B2].

Set l = f (x,y)x− 1 = x

xD A2 + yD B2 =

The right-hand is a positive lower bound of uncertainty relation

Proof of Lemma 1 We recall Maccone-Pati’s lower bound LMP2 using a different method.

Note that 2D AD B 6 D A2 + D B2 and D (A + B) 6 D A + D B, therefore D A2 + D B2 > 1

D (A + B)2. The physical meaning is
that the total ignorance of an ensemble of quantum states is less than or equal to the sum of individual ignorance. This means
that the sum of uncertainties obeys the convexity property31:
