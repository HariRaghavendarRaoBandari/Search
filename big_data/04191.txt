SINGULAR EQUIVALENCE OF FINITE DIMENSIONAL ALGEBRAS

WITH RADICAL SQUARE ZERO

A. R. NASR-ISFAHANI

Abstract. Let Q be a ﬁnite quiver. We give an operation on Q which creates a new
quiver Q′ with fewer vertices, such that the ﬁnite dimensional algebras kQ/J 2 and
kQ′/J 2 are singularly equivalent. This operation is very general quiver move which
simultaneously includes as speciﬁc examples the moves which arise naturally in symbolic
dynamics (e.g., (elementary) strong shift equivalent, (in-out) splitting, source elimina-
tion, etc.).

1. Introduction

Throughout this paper Q will denote a quiver, and k will denote an arbitrary ﬁeld. The
path algebra of Q with coeﬃcients in k denote by kQ, and its two-sided ideal generated
by arrows denote by J. The singularity category of kQ/J 2, denoted Dsg(kQ/J 2), is the
Verdier quotient category of the bonded derived category of ﬁnitely generated kQ/J 2-
modules with respect to the full subcategory consisting of perfect complexes [14, 25].
The singularity category Dsg(kQ/J 2) of kQ/J 2 is trivial if and only if kQ/J 2 has ﬁnite
global dimension. Thus the singularity category of kQ/J 2 measures the homological
singularity of kQ/J 2. Note that the singularity category Dsg(kQ/J 2) of kQ/J 2 is triangle
equivalent to the full subcategory consisting of compact objects of stable derived category
Kac(kQ/J 2-Inj) of kQ/J 2 [22].

The Leavitt path algebra of Q with coeﬃcients in k, denoted Lk(Q), was introduced and
investigated by P. Ara, M. A. Moreno and E. Pardo in [7] and by G. Abrams and G. Aranda
Pino in [1]. Leavitt path algebras are generalization of the algebras constructed by Leavitt
in [23] to produce rings R that do not have the Invariant Basis Number property (i.e.,
Rm
R as left R-module with m 6= n). These algebras can be considered as an algebraic
R
counterpart of analytic graph C ∗-algebras. Leavitt path algebras have arisen in a variety
of diﬀerent contexts as diverse as analysis, noncommutative algebra, noncommutative
algebraic geometry, symbolic dynamics, number theory and representation theory.

Recently X. W. Chen and D. Yang in [15] discovered a nice connection between the
derived category of diﬀerential graded Lk(Q)op-modules and the homotopy category of
acyclic complexes of injective kQ/J 2-modules. X. W. Chen and D. Yang proved that: If
Q is a ﬁnite quiver without sinks, then there are triangle equivalences Kac(kQ/J 2−Inj) ≃
D(Lk(Q)op) and Dsg(kQ/J 2) ≃ perf (Lk(Q)op) (which obtains from ﬁrst equivalence re-
stricting to compact objects). Also they proved that: Let Q and Q′ be ﬁnite quivers

without sinks. Then the algebras kQ/J 2 and kQ′/J 2 are singularly equivalent if and only
if there is a triangle equivalence Kac(kQ/J 2-Inj) ≃ Kac(kQ′/J 2-Inj) if and only if there
is a triangle equivalence Kac(kQ/J 2-P roj) ≃ Kac(kQ′/J 2-P roj) if and only if the Leavitt
path algebras Lk(Q) and Lk(Q′) are derived equivalent if and only if the Leavitt path
algebras Lk(Q) and Lk(Q′) are graded Morita equivalent.

Our aim in this paper is to give an operation on a ﬁnite quiver Q which produces a
new quiver Q′, such that the ﬁnite dimensional algebras kQ/J 2 and kQ′/J 2 are singularly
equivalent. For the proof we use the X. W. Chen and D. Yang’s Theorem [15] and show
that the Leavitt path algebras Lk(Q) and Lk(Q′) are graded Morita equivalent. Several
authors in [3], [4], [5] and [20] have investigated certain constructions on quivers which
preserve the (graded) Morita equivalence class of the associated Leavitt path algebras.
This results are algebraic analogue of the analytic result were given in [10], [12], [13], [16],
[17] and [18]. In the above papers the authors explored the connections between symbolic
dynamics and Leavitt path algebras (graph C ∗-algebras).

The graded Morita equivalence property of Leavitt path algebras not only important in
the context of Leavitt path algebras and singularity of path algebras, but also has appli-
cations in the noncommutative algebraic geometry. S. P. Smith in [27] and R. Hazrat in
[20] studied the connections between Leavitt path algebra and noncommutative algebraic
geometry. Combining the results of Smith and Hazrat we see that for ﬁnite quivers Q
and Q′ without sinks, if Lk(Q) and Lk(Q′) are graded Morita equivalent then the cate-
gories QGr(kQ) (resp. qgr(kQ)) and QGr(kQ′) (resp. qgr(kQ′)) are equivalent, where
QGr(kQ) (resp. qgr(kQ)) is the category of quasi-coherent (resp. coherent) sheaves on
noncommutative projective scheme P rojnc(kQ).

The paper is organized as follows.

In Section 2 we recall some deﬁnitions and ba-
sic properties of Leavitt path algebras, diﬀerential graded algebras and noncommutative
algebraic geometry that we need in the paper. In section 3 we give our main result, The-
orem 3.1, which provide suﬃcient conditions for quivers Q and Q′ such that the Leavitt
path algebras Lk(Q) and Lk(Q′) are graded Morita equivalent. Also in this section we
discusses some corollaries and applications of the main Theorem. Note that the results of
this section not only clariﬁes the already known results, but also give a positive answer
of the Hazrat’s question in [20, Remark 31.], provide new examples of interesting quiver
moves which preserve the graded Morita equivalence class of the associated Leavitt path
algebras, and extends some known results. Finally, in the last section we give the proof
of the main Theorem.

2. Definitions and Preliminaries

2.1. Leavitt path algebras. A quiver Q = (Q0, Q1, r, s) consists of two sets Q0 and
Q1 together with maps r, s : Q1 → Q0. The elements of Q0 are called vertices and the
elements of Q1 edges. A quiver Q is said to be ﬁnite if Q0 and Q1 are ﬁnite sets. A vertex
which emits no edges is called sink ; a vertex which emits inﬁnitely-many edges is called
inﬁnite emitter.

A ﬁnite path µ in a quiver Q is a ﬁnite sequence of edges µ = α1 . . . αn such that
r(αi) = s(αi+1) for i = 1, . . . , n − 1. In this case, n = l(µ) is the length of µ. We view
the elements of Q0 as paths of length 0. For any n ∈ N the set of paths of length n

SINGULAR EQUIVALENCE OF FINITE DIMENSIONAL ALGEBRAS WITH RADICAL SQUARE ZERO3

is denoted by Qn. Also, Path(Q) stands for the set of all ﬁnite paths, i.e., Path(Q) =

Sn∈N Qn. We denote by µ0 the set of the vertices of the path µ = α1 . . . αn, that is, the

set {s(α1), r(α1), . . . , r(αn)}. A path µ = α1 . . . αn is closed if r(αn) = s(α1), in this case
µ is said to be based at the vertex s(α1). The closed path µ is called a cycle if it does not
pass through any of its vertices twice, that is, if s(αi) 6= s(αj) for every i 6= j.

A sequence {αi}i∈N of edges in Q is called an inﬁnite path in case r(αi) = s(αi+1) for
all i and Q∞ stands for the set of all inﬁnite paths. For each α ∈ Q1, we call α∗ a ghost
edge. We let r(α∗) denote s(α), and we let s(α∗) denote r(α).

Deﬁnition 2.1. Let Q be an arbitrary quiver and k an arbitrary ﬁeld. The Leavitt path
algebra Lk(Q) is deﬁned to be the k-algebra generated by a set {v : v ∈ Q0} of pairwise
orthogonal idempotents together with a set of variables {α, α∗ : α ∈ Q1} which satisfy
the following conditions:

(1) s(α)α = α = αr(α) for each α ∈ Q1.
(2) r(α)α∗ = α∗ = α∗s(α) for each α ∈ Q1.
(3) (The “CK-1 relations”) For each α, β ∈ Q1, α∗α = r(α) and α∗β = 0 if α 6= β.
(4) (The “CK-2 relations”) For each v ∈ Q0 with 0 < |s−1(v)| < ∞,

v = X{γ∈Q1, s(γ)=v}

γγ∗.

The relations (CK1) and (CK2) are called the ”Cuntz-Krieger relations” after the re-
lations introduced by Cuntz and Krieger for their eponymous C ∗-algebras. Another def-

set of vertices Q0 and also has the same edges Q1 together with the so-called ghost edges
α∗ for each α ∈ Q1, which go in the reverse direction to that of α ∈ Q1. Thus, Lk(Q)

inition for Lk(Q) can be given using the extended quiver bQ. This quiver has the same
can be deﬁned as the usual path algebra kbQ subject to the Cuntz-Krieger relations. As a

consequence, if A is any k-algebra which contains a set of elements satisfying these same
relations (we call such a set a Q-family), then there is a (unique) k-algebra homomorphism
from Lk(Q) to A mapping the generators of Lk(Q) to their appropriate counterparts in
A. We will refer to this property as the Universal Homomorphism Property of Lk(Q).

generators xi, yi, 1 ≤ i ≤ n and relations xiyj = δij, for each i, j andPn

Recall that the classical Leavitt algebra, Lk(1, n), is the free associative k-algebra withe
i=1 yixi = 1. Many
well-known algebras can be realized as the Leavitt path algebra of a quiver. Classical
Leavitt algebras Lk(1, n) for n ≥ 2 can be obtained by the rose with n petals. The ring of
Laurent polynomials k[x, x−1] is the Leavitt path algebra of the quiver given by a single
loop. Matrix algebras Mn(k) can be realized by the An (i.e.
line quiver with n vertices
and n − 1 edges) (for more details see [1], [26], and [2]).

A singular vertex is a vertex that is either a sink or an inﬁnite emitter, and we denote
sing as regular

the set of singular vertices by Q0
vertices. Note that a vertex v ∈ Q0 is a regular vertex if and only if 0 < |s−1(v)| < ∞.

sing. We refer to the elements of Q0

reg := Q0\Q0

We deﬁne a relation ≥ on Q0 by setting v ≥ w if there exists a path µ in Q from v
to w, that is, v = s(µ) and w = r(µ). A subset H of Q0 is called hereditary if for each
v ∈ H, v ≥ w implies that w ∈ H. A set H ⊆ Q0 is saturated if for any regular vertex v,
r(s−1(v)) ⊆ H implies v ∈ H. The set T (v) = {w ∈ E0|v ≥ w} is the tree of v, and it is
the smallest hereditary subset of Q0 containing v. The hereditary saturated closure of a

(a) Λ0(X) = T (X),
(b) Λn(X) = {y ∈ Q0|s−1(y) 6= ∅, r(s−1(y)) ⊆ Λn−1(X)} ∪ Λn−1(X), for n ≥ 1

2.2. Diﬀerential graded algebras. The deﬁnitions of this section are borrowed from
[15, section 2] and [21] .

Let A be a G-graded algebra. A graded right A-module M is deﬁned to be a right A-
module M with a direct sum decomposition M = ⊕g∈GMg, where each Mg is an additive
subgroup of M such that MgAh ⊆ Mg+h for all g, h ∈ G. Elements m ∈ Mg are said to be
homogeneous of degree g, and are denoted by |m| = g. We denote by Gr-A the category
of graded right A-modules with degree preserving morphism, or GrG-A to emphasis the
category is G-graded.

One of the useful properties of Lk(Q) is that it is a graded algebra. Let G be a group
with identity element e and w : Q1 → G be a weight map. Also deﬁne w(α∗) = w(α)−1

and w(v) = e, for each α ∈ Q1 and v ∈ Q0. Then the path algebra kbQ of the extended
quiver bQ is a G-graded k-algebra and since Cuntz-Krieger relations are homogeneous,
components Lk(Q) =Ln∈Z Lk(Q)n satisfying Lk(Q)nLk(Q)m ⊆ Lk(Q)n+m. Actually,

then Lk(Q) is a G-graded k-algebra. The usual grading given to a Leavitt path algebra is
a Z-grading by taking w(α) = 1, w(α∗) = −1 and w(v) = 0, for each α ∈ Q1 and v ∈ Q0.
In this case the Leavitt path algebra can be decomposed as a direct sum of homogeneous

Lk(Q)n = spank{pq∗ : p, q ∈ Path(Q), l(p) − l(q) = n}.

Every element x ∈ Lk(Q)n is a homogeneous element of degree n. An ideal I is graded

if it inherits the grading of Lk(Q), that is, if I = Ln∈Z(I ∩ Lk(Q)n). Tomforde in [29]

(see also [8, Theorem 3.5]) proved that:(Graded Uniqueness Theorem) Let Q be a quiver
and let Lk(Q) be the associated Leavitt path algebra with the usual Z-grading. If A is a
Z-graded ring, and π : Lk(Q) → A is a graded ring homomorphism with π(v) 6= 0 for all
v ∈ Q0, then π is injective.

Deﬁnition 2.2. ([21, Deﬁnition 2.3.2]) Let A and B be G-graded algebras.

(1) Let M be a graded right A-module and g ∈ G. The graded right A-module M(g) =
⊕h∈GM(g)h, where M(g)h = Mg+h, is called the g-suspended, or g-shifted graded right
A-module.

(2) For each g ∈ G, the g-suspension functor Tg : Gr-A → Gr-A, M 7→ M(g) is an

isomorphism with the property TgTh = Tg+h, g, h ∈ G

(3) A functor φ : Gr-A → Gr-B is called a graded functor if φTg = Tgφ for each g ∈ G.
(4) A graded functor φ : Gr-A → Gr-B is called a graded equivalence if there is a

graded functor ψ : Gr-B → Gr-A such that ψφ ∼=gr 1Gr-A and φψ ∼=gr 1Gr-B.

(5) If there is a graded equivalence between Gr-A and Gr-B, we say A and B are graded
equivalent or graded Morita equivalent and we write Gr-A ≈gr Gr-B, or GrG-A ≈gr GrG-
B to emphasis the categories are G-graded.

(6) A functor φ : Mod-A → Mod-B is called graded functor if there is a graded functor
: Gr-A → Gr-B such that the following diagram, where the vertical functors are

φ′
forgetful functor, commutes.

The functor φ′ is called an associated graded functor of φ.
(7) A functor φ : Mod-A → Mod-B is called a graded equivalence if it is graded and an

A diﬀerential graded algebra (or simply dg algebra) is a graded algebra A with a
diﬀerential d : A → A of degree one such that d(ab) = d(a)b+(−1)|a|ad(b) for homogeneous
elements a, b ∈ A. We take a Leavitt path algebra Lk(Q) as a diﬀerential graded algebra
with trivial diﬀerential. A right diﬀerential graded A-module (or simply right dg A-
module) M is a right graded A-module M = ⊕n∈ZMn with a diﬀerential dM : M → M
such that dM (ma) = dM (m)a + (−1)|m|md(a) for homogeneous elements a ∈ A and
m ∈ M. A morphism between dg A-modules is a morphism of graded A-modules which
commutes with the diﬀerentials. Let C(A) be the category of dg A-modules. Let M be a
graded A-module. Chen and Yang in [15] associate a graded A-module M[1] to M such
that M[1]n = Mn+1 and the A-action ◦ on M[1] is deﬁned as m ◦ a = (−1)|a|ma. This
gives rise to the translation functor [1] : Gr-A → Gr-A of categories. The translation
functor [1] : C(A) → C(A) is deﬁned similarly and the diﬀerential is given by dM [1] =
−dM . We denote by K(A) the homotopy category of dg A-modules. Note that K(A)
is a triangulated category. We denote by D(A) the derived category of dg A-modules,
which is obtained from C(A) by formally inverting all quasi-isomorphisms. Denote by
Mod-A the abelian category of right A-modules, Inj-A the category of injective right A-
modules and by P roj-A the category of projective right A-modules. Consider K(Inj-A)
(resp. K(P roj-A)) the homotopy category of complexes of injective (resp. projective)
A-modules, which is a triangulated subcategory of K(A). A complex X ∈ C(A) is
called acyclic if Hn(X) = 0, for all n ∈ Z. The triangulated subcategory of K(Inj-A)
(resp. K(P roj-A)) consisting of acyclic complexes will be denoted by Kac(Inj-A) (resp.
Kac(P roj-A)).

We denote by Qop, the opposite quiver of Q and by Lk(Q)op, the opposite algebra of
Lk(Q), which is also viewed as a diﬀerential graded algebra with trivial diﬀerential. Chen
and Yang in [15] proved the following proposition which we use it in this paper.
Proposition 2.3. [15, Proposition 6.4] Let Q and Q′ be ﬁnite quivers without sinks. Then
the following statements are equivalent:

(1) the algebras kQ/J 2 and kQ′/J 2 are singularly equivalent;
(2) the Leavitt path algebras Lk(Q) and Lk(Q′) are graded Morita equivalent;
(3) the Leavitt path algebras Lk(Q) and Lk(Q′) are derived equivalent;
(4) the opposite Leavitt path algebras Lk(Q)op and Lk(Q′)op are derived equivalent;
(5) there is a triangle equivalence Kac(Inj-kQ/J 2) ∼−→ Kac(Inj-kQ′/J 2);
(6) there is a triangle equivalence Kac(P roj-kQop/J 2) ∼−→ Kac(P roj-kQ′op/J 2).

2.3. Noncommutative algebraic geometry. Let Λ be a noncommutative algebra, Gr-
Λ the category of Z-graded right Λ-modules and F dim-Λ the Serre subcategory of ﬁnite

dimensional submodules. Noncommutative algebraic geometry studies the quotient cate-
gory QGr(Λ) = Gr-Λ/F dim-Λ. This is not a new idea. About 60 years ago, Serre proved
that: If Λ is a commutative algebra which is generated by a ﬁnite number of elements of
degree 1, then the category of quasi-coherent sheaves on the scheme P roj(Λ) is equivalent
to QGr(Λ). In Noncommutative algebraic geometry a noncommutative scheme P rojnc(Λ)
is deﬁned such that the category of quasi-coherent sheaves on P rojnc(Λ) is QGr(Λ). When
Λ is a coherent algebra, qgr(Λ) := gr-Λ/f dim-Λ is viewed as the category of coherent
sheaves on P rojnc(Λ), where gr-Λ is the full subcategory of Gr-Λ consisting ﬁnitely pre-
sented graded right Λ-modules and f dim-Λ is the full subcategory of gr-Λ consisting of
ﬁnite dimensional modules. Paul Smith in [27] discovered a nice connection between the
category QGr(kQ), where Q is a ﬁnite quiver, and the category of graded modules over
Leavitt path algebra Lk(Q). He also proved that: If Q is a ﬁnite quiver, then triangulated
categories Dsg(kQ/J 2) and qgr(kQ) are equivalent [27, Theorem 1.6]. Let Q and Q′ be
ﬁnite quivers without sinks, if the Leavitt path algebras Lk(Q) and Lk(Q′) are graded
Morita equivalent, then by Proposition 2.3 and [27, Theorem 1.6] we have qgr(kQ) and
qgr(kQ′) are equivalent.

Let A and B be square matrices with entries in N. If there exist a pair of matrices L
and R with non-negative integer entries such that A = LR and B = RL then we say A
and B are elementary strong shift equivalence [24, Deﬁnition 7.2.1]. We say A and B are
strong shift equivalent if there is a chain of elementary strong shift equivalences from A
to B. Also A and B are called shift equivalent if there are non-negative integer matrices
C and D such that An = CD and Bn = DC, for some n ∈ N, AC = CB and DA = BD.
Note that the notion of (strong) shift equivalence comes from symbolic dynamics (for
more details see [24]). Recently Smith in [28] proved that: If the incidence matrices of
quivers Q and Q′ are strong shift equivalent, then QGr(kQ) and QGr(kQ′) are equivalent.
Hazrat in [20, Proposition 15] proved that: For ﬁnite quivers Q and Q′ with no sink, if
Lk(Q) and Lk(Q′) are graded Morita equivalent, then the incidence matrices of quivers
Q and Q′ are shift equivalent. He also proved that: For ﬁnite quivers Q and Q′ with no
sink, if the incidence matrices of quivers Q and Q′ are shift equivalent, then QGr(kQ)
and QGr(kQ′) are equivalent ([20, Corollary 24]). Combining this results we have: For
ﬁnite quivers Q and Q′ with no sink if Lk(Q) and Lk(Q′) are graded Morita equivalent,
then QGr(kQ) and QGr(kQ′) are equivalent.

3. Main theorem and its applications

In this section we give the main theorem of this paper and some applications of the
main theorem. Also we show that several known constructions are corollaries of the main
theorem.

The following theorem is our main theorem, which we prove it in section 4. We denote

the cyclic subgroup of a rational numbers Q generated by 1/n, by (1/n)Z

Theorem 3.1. Let Q be a quiver with ﬁnite number of vertices (but it can have vertices
which are inﬁnite emitters), k an arbitrary ﬁeld, Q′0 ⊂ Q0 such that Q0
sing ⊆ Q′0 and if
µ ∈ Path(Q) is a cycle then Q′0 ∩ µ0 6= ∅. Let Q′ be the quiver with vertex set Q′0 and
one edge eµ for each path µ ∈ Path(Q)\Q0 with s(µ), r(µ) ∈ Q′0 and r(µi) ∈ Q0\Q′0
for 1 ≤ i < l(µ), such that s(eµ) = s(µ) and r(eµ) = r(µ), and let n = max{l(µ)|µ ∈

SINGULAR EQUIVALENCE OF FINITE DIMENSIONAL ALGEBRAS WITH RADICAL SQUARE ZERO7

Path(Q)\Q0, s(µ), r(µ) ∈ Q′0 and r(µi) ∈ Q0\Q′0 f or 1 ≤ i < l(µ)}. Then Lk(Q′) and
Lk(Q) are (1/n)Z-graded Morita equivalent.

Remark 3.2. Note that for a given quiver Q, choosing a diﬀerent sets Q′0, Q′′0 ⊂ Q0
satisfying the conditions of Theorem 3.1 give a diﬀerent graded Morita equivalences. For
example, let

By Theorem 3.1, Lk(Q′) and Lk(Q) are Z-graded Morita equivalent, but Lk(Q′′) and
Lk(Q) are (1/2)Z-graded Morita equivalent.

Remark 3.3. Note that in Theorem 3.1, Lk(Q′) and Lk(Q) are not Z-graded Morita
equivalent in general. For example, let

Q : •1

, and Q′0 = {1}. Lk(Q′) and Lk(Q) are not Z-graded Morita equivalent but they are
(1/2)Z-graded Morita equivalent.

Let G be a group and A =Lg∈G Ag be a G-graded algebra. The set GA = {g ∈ G|Ag 6=

0} is called the support of A.

Remark 3.4. Note that in Theorem 3.1 the support of Lk(Q′), (1/n)ZLk(Q′) is Z, but the
support of Lk(Q), (1/n)ZLk(Q), is not equal to Z in general.

Then we say that Q1 and Q2 are elementary strong shift equivalent (Q1 ∼ES Q2) via
Q3. We deﬁne strong shift equivalence (denoted by ∼S) to be the equivalence relation on
row-ﬁnite quivers generated by elementary strong shift equivalence. It is easy to see that
ﬁnite quivers Q1 and Q2 are elementary strong shift equivalent if and only if incidence
matrices BQ1 and BQ2 are elementary strong shift equivalence. Note that in this case if
BQ1 = LR and BQ2 = RL, where L and R are matrices with non-negative integer entries,

Corollary 3.8. Let Q1, Q2 and Q3 be ﬁnite quivers which contain no sinks and which
satisfy the conditions that Q1 ∼ES Q2 via Q3. Then Leavitt path algebras Lk(Q1) and
Lk(Q2) are (1/2)Z-graded Morita equivalent. Also if Q1 ∼S Q2, then Lk(Q1) and Lk(Q2)
are (1/2)Z-graded Morita equivalent.

by Theorem 3.1, Lk(Q2) and Lk(Q3) are (1/2)Z-graded Morita equivalent and the result
follows.
(cid:3)

Note that Hazrat in Theorem 30 of [20] proved Corollary 3.8 and ask the following
question: Let Q1 and Q2 be ﬁnite quivers with no sinks which are elementary strong shift
equivalent with quiver Q3. Whether Lk(Q1) and Lk(Q2) are actually Z-graded Morita
equivalent?
The following proposition gives the positive answer of Hazrat’s question.

Proposition 3.9. Let H be a subgroup of a group G, R and S be G-graded rings such
that GR, GS ⊆ H. If R and S are graded Morita equivalence as G-graded rings, then R
and S are graded Morita equivalence as H-graded rings.

Proof. Assume that R and S are graded Morita equivalence as G-graded rings. By The-
orem 2.3.7 of [21] (see also Proposition 5.3 and Theorem 5.4 of [19]), Mod-R is G-graded
equivalent to Mod-S. Thus there exists a functor Φ : Mod-R −→ Mod-S, which is
G-graded and equivalence. So there exists a G-graded functor Φ′ : GrG-R −→ GrG-S
such that the following diagram, where the vertical functors are forgetful functors, is
commutative.

GrG-R

F

Mod-R

φ′

/ GrG-S

F

/ Mod-S

Since Φ′ is G-graded functor, then for each g ∈ G, Φ′Tg = TgΦ′, where Tg : GrG-R → GrG-
R, M 7→ M(g) is g-suspension functor. Choose a set U of left coset representatives of

for each h ∈ H (since GS ⊆ H, then χ(M) ∈ GrH-S). Let φ′′ = χφ′ψ : GrH-

H in G, and let χ : GrG-S −→ GrH-S be deﬁned by letting χ(M)h = Lu∈U Muh,
R −→ GrH-S, where ψ : GrH-R −→ GrG-R such that for M = Lh∈H Mh ∈ GrH-R,
ψ(M) = Lg∈G Mg, and Mg = 0 for each g ∈ G \ H (since GR ⊆ H then ψ(M) ∈ GrG-
Thus χφ′ψTh1(M) = χTh1φ′ψ(M) = χ(Lg∈G(φ′ψ(M))gh1) = Lu∈U,g∈G(φ′ψ(M))ugh1.
Th1φ′′(M) = Th1(Lu∈U,g∈G(φ′ψ(M))ug) = Lu∈U,g∈G(φ′ψ(M))ugh1. Then φ′′Th1 = Th1φ′′

R). We claim that φ′′ is an associated H-graded functor of φ. For each h1 ∈ H and
M ∈ GrH-R, φ′′Th1(M) = χφ′ψTh1(M). Since Φ′ is G-graded functor, φ′Th1 = Th1φ′.

and so φ′′ is a graded functor. Also the following diagram is commutative.

GrH-R

Thus φ′′ is an associated H-graded functor of φ and hence R and S are graded Morita

Corollary 3.10. Let Q1, Q2 and Q3 be ﬁnite quivers which contain no sinks and which
satisfy the conditions that Q1 ∼ES Q2 via Q3. Then Leavitt path algebras Lk(Q1) and

Lk(Q2) are Z-graded Morita equivalent. Also if Q1 ∼S Q2, then Lk(Q1) and Lk(Q2) are
Z-graded Morita equivalent.

Proof. By Corollary 3.8, Lk(Q1) and Lk(Q2) are (1/2)Z-graded Morita equivalent. But
the supports of Lk(Q1) and Lk(Q2) are equal to Z and so the result follows by Proposition
3.9.
(cid:3)

By using of the Corollary 3.10 we have the following corollary which shows that, the
main result of [28], Proposition 15.(2) and Corollary 24 of [20] are corollaries of Theorem
3.1.

Corollary 3.11. i) Let L and R be N-valued matrices such that LR and RL make sense.
Let QLR be the quiver with incidence matrix LR and QRL the quiver with incidence matrix
RL. Then Lk(QLR) and Lk(QRL) are graded Morita equivalent.
ii) If the incidence matrices for Q and Q′ are strong shift equivalent, then Lk(Q) and
Lk(Q′) are graded Morita equivalent.

A shift space (X, α) over a ﬁnite alphabet A is a compact subset X of AZ that is stable
under the shift map α deﬁned by α(f )(n) = f (n + 1). Let Q be a ﬁnite quiver with no
sources and sinks. The shift space XQ, whose alphabet is the set of arrows in Q is called
the edge shift of Q [24, Deﬁnition 2.2.5]. Edge shifts are subshifts of ﬁnite type. Also
one may associate a subshift of ﬁnite type XM to every square 0 − 1 matrix M having
no zero rows or columns [24, Deﬁnition 2.3.7]. The alphabet is now the set of vertices for
the quiver whose incidence matrix is M. Shift spaces (X, αX) and (Y, αY ) are conjugate
(equivalence), or topologically conjugate, if there is a homeomorphism ϕ : X → Y such
that αY ϕ = ϕαX. Williams’s Theorem explains the importance of strong shift equivalence:

Theorem 3.12. (Williams’s Theorem [30, Theorem A]) Let M and N be square N-valued
∼= XN if and
matrices and XM and XN the associated subshifts of ﬁnite type. Then XM
only if M and N are strong shift equivalent.

By using Williams’s Theorem and Corollary 3.11 we have the following corollary.

Corollary 3.13. Let (X, α) and (X, β) be subshifts of ﬁnite type, and Q and Q′ quivers
such that (X, α) = XQ and (X, β) = XQ′. If (X, α) and (X, β) are conjugate, then Lk(Q)
and Lk(Q′) are Z-graded Morita equivalent.

3.2. Splitting. The notion of (in, out)-splitting, introduced by D. Lind and B. Marcus
in [24] for using in symbolic dynamic. Authors of [13] and [5] use this notion in graph C ∗
algebras and Leavitt path algebras.

Deﬁnition 3.14. ([13, Section 5], [5, Deﬁnition 1.9]) Let Q = (Q0, Q1, r, s) be a quiver.
For each v ∈ Q0 with r−1(v) 6= ∅, partition the set r−1(v) into disjoint nonempty subsets
ξv
1 , · · · , ξv
m(v) where m(v) ≥ 1 (If v is a source then we put m(v) = 0). Let P denote the
resulting partition of Q1. We form the in-split quiver Qr(P) from Q using the partition
P as follows:

Qr(P)0 = {vi|v ∈ Q0, 1 ≤ i ≤ m(v)} ∪ {v|m(v) = 0},

SINGULAR EQUIVALENCE OF FINITE DIMENSIONAL ALGEBRAS WITH RADICAL SQUARE ZERO11

Qr(P)1 = {ej|e ∈ Q1, 1 ≤ j ≤ m(s(e))} ∪ {e|m(s(e)) = 0},

and deﬁne rQr(P), sQr(P) : Qr(P)1 → Qr(P)0 by
sQr(P)(ej) = s(e)j and sQr(P)(e) = s(e),
rQr(P)(ej) = r(e)i and rQr(P)(e) = r(e)i where e ∈ ξr(e)

. Conversely, if Q and Q′ are
quivers, and there exists a partition P of Q1 for which Qr(P) = Q′, then Q is called an
in-amalgamation of Q′.

Deﬁnition 3.15. ([13, Section 3], [5, Deﬁnition 1.12]) Let Q = (Q0, Q1, r, s) be a quiver.
For each v ∈ Q0 with s−1(v) 6= ∅, partition the set s−1(v) into disjoint nonempty subsets
v, · · · , ξm(v)
ξ1
where m(v) ≥ 1 (If v is a sink then we put m(v) = 0). Let P denote the
resulting partition of Q1. We form the out-split quiver Qs(P) from Q using the partition
P as follows:

v

Qs(P)0 = {vi|v ∈ Q0, 1 ≤ i ≤ m(v)} ∪ {v|m(v) = 0},

Qs(P)1 = {ej|e ∈ Q1, 1 ≤ j ≤ m(r(e))} ∪ {e|m(r(e)) = 0},

and deﬁne rQs(P), sQs(P) : Qs(P)1 → Qs(P)0 for each e ∈ ξi
sQs(P)(ej) = s(e)i and sQs(P)(e) = s(e)i,
rQs(P)(ej) = r(e)j and rQs(P)(e) = r(e). Conversely, if Q and Q′ are quivers, and there
exists a partition P of Q1 for which Qs(P) = Q′, then Q is called an out-amalgamation
of Q′.

The following corollary shows that Proposition 15.(1) of [20] and Corollary 4.1 of [28]

are corollaries of Theorem 3.1.

Corollary 3.16. Let Q be a ﬁnite quiver with no sinks, P be a partition of Q1, Qr(P)
the in-split quiver from Q using P and Qs(P) the out-split quiver from Q using P. Then
Lk(Q), Lk(Qr(P)) and Lk(Qs(P)) are Z-graded Morita equivalent.

Proof. By [13, Proposition 6.3] Q ∼ES Qr(P) and by [13, Proposition 6.2] Q ∼ES Qs(P).
Then the result follows by Corollary 3.10.
(cid:3)

Deﬁnition 3.17. ([5, Deﬁnition 1.2]) Let Q = (Q0, Q1, r, s) be a quiver with at least two
vertices, and let v ∈ Q0 be a source. We form the source elimination quiver Q\v of Q as
follows:

Hazrat in [20, Proposition 13] proved that, if Q is a ﬁnite quiver with no sinks and
v ∈ Q0 is a source, then Lk(Q) and Lk(Q\v) are graded Morita equivalent. In the following
corollary we generalize this proposition.

Corollary 3.18. Let Q be a quiver with ﬁnite number of vertices and v ∈ Q0 be a source
which is not inﬁnite emitter or sink. Then Lk(Q\v) and Lk(Q) are Z-graded Morita
equivalent.

Proof. Put Q′0 = Q0\{v}, then the result follows by Theorem 3.1.

(cid:3)

Let Λ = k(Q, ρ) be a ﬁnite dimensional path algebra over a ﬁeld k of the ﬁnite quiver
(Q, ρ) with relations. Let v be a source in Q and ¯ev the corresponding idempotent in Λ. We
have ¯evΛ ¯ev ≃ k and ¯evΛ(1− ¯ev) = 0. If (Q′, ρ′) denotes the quiver with relations we obtain
by removing the vertex v and the relations starting at v, then (1− ¯ev)Λ(1− ¯ev) ≃ k(Q′, ρ′).
Thus k(Q, ρ) is obtained from Λ′ = k(Q′, ρ′) by adding one vertex v, together with arrows

and relations starting at v. Then we have Λ ≃(cid:18)

(1 − ¯ev)Λ ¯ev Λ′ (cid:19). Λ is called one-point

extension of Λ′ [11, Page 71].

By Proposition 2.3 and Corollary 3.18 we have the following corollary.

Corollary 3.19. Let Λ be a ﬁnite dimensional algebra which is one-point extension of
Λ′. Then the algebras Λ/J 2 and Λ′/J 2 are singularly equivalent.
Deﬁnition 3.20. ([5, Deﬁnition 1.6]) Let Q = (Q0, Q1, r, s) be a quiver and v ∈ Q0. Let
v∗ and f be symbols not in Q0 ∪ Q1. We form the expansion quiver Qv from Q at v as
follows:

v = Q0 ∪ {v∗},

v = Q1 ∪ {f },

if e = f,
otherwise.

Conversely, if Q and Q′ are quivers, and there exists a vertex v of Q for which Qv = Q′,
then Q is called a contraction of Q′.

G. Abrams et al. in [5, Corollary 3.4] proved that, if k is an inﬁnite ﬁeld, Q is row-ﬁnite

quiver and v ∈ Q0, then Lk(Q) and Lk(Qv) are Morita equivalent.
Corollary 3.21. Let Q be a quiver with ﬁnite number of vertices and v ∈ Q0 which is not
inﬁnite emitter or sink. Then Lk(Qv) and Lk(Q) are (1/2)Z-graded Morita equivalent.
Proof. Put Q′0 = Q0

v\{v∗}, then the result follows by Theorem 3.1.

(cid:3)

Deﬁnition 3.22. ([5, Deﬁnitions 1.18 and 1.19]) A quiver transformation is called stan-
dard if it is one of these six types:
in-splitting, in-amalgamation, out-splitting, out-
amalgamation, expansion, and contraction. Analogously, a function which transforms a
non-negative integer matrix A to a non-negative integer matrix B is called standard if
the corresponding quiver operation from QA to QB is standard. If Q and Q′ are quivers,
a ﬂow equivalence from Q to Q′ is a sequence Q = Q0 → Q1 → · · · → Qn = Q′ of quivers
and standard quiver transformations which starts at Q and ends at Q′. We say that Q
and Q′ are ﬂow equivalent in case there is a ﬂow equivalence from Q to Q′. Analogously,
a ﬂow equivalence between matrices A and B is deﬁned to be a ﬂow equivalence between
the quivers QA and QB.

SINGULAR EQUIVALENCE OF FINITE DIMENSIONAL ALGEBRAS WITH RADICAL SQUARE ZERO13

By using Corollaries 3.16, 3.18 and 3.21 we have the following:

Corollary 3.23. Let Q and Q′ be quivers with ﬁnite number of vertices and no sinks such
that Q and Q′ are ﬂow equivalent. Then Lk(Q) and Lk(Q′) are (1/2)Z-graded Morita
equivalent.

3.3. Delays. The deﬁnitions of this section are borrowed from [13, section 4] (see also [5,
Deﬁnitions 3.2 and 3.5].

Deﬁnition 3.24. Let Q = (Q0, Q1, r, s) be a quiver. A map ds : Q0 ∪ Q1 → N ∪ {∞}
such that:

(i) if w ∈ Q0 is not a sink then ds(w) = sup{ds(e)|s(e) = w}, and
(ii) if ds(x) = 1 for some x then either x is a sink or x emits inﬁnitely many edges,
is called a Drinen source-vector. Note that only vertices are allowed to have an inﬁnite
ds-value; moreover if ds(v) = ∞ and v is not a sink, then there are edges with source v
and arbitrarily large ds-value. From this data we construct a new quiver as follows: Let

ds(Q)0 = {vi|v ∈ Q0; 0 ≤ i ≤ ds(v)}, and

ds(Q)1 = Q1 ∪ {f (v)i|1 ≤ i ≤ ds(v)},

and for e ∈ Q1 deﬁne rds(Q)(e) = r(e)0 and sds(Q)(e) = s(e)ds(e). For f (v)i deﬁne
sds(Q)(f (v)i) = vi−1 and rds(Q)(f (v)i) = vi. The resulting quiver ds(Q) is called the
out-delayed quiver of Q for the Drinen source-vector ds.

In the out-delayed quiver the original vertices correspond to those vertices with super-
script 0. Inductively, the edge e ∈ Q1 is delayed from leaving s(e)0 and arriving at r(e)0
by a path of length ds(e). The Drinen source vector ds is strictly proper if, whenever v has
inﬁnite valency, there is no vi with inﬁnite valency unless i = ds(v) < 1. A Drinen source
vector ds which gives rise to an out-delayed quiver ds(Q) which may be constructed using
a ﬁnite sequence of strictly proper Drinen source vectors is said to be proper.

Deﬁnition 3.25. Let Q = (Q0, Q1, r, s) be a quiver. A map dr : Q0 ∪ Q1 → N ∪ {∞}
satisfying:

(i) if w is not a source then dr(w) = sup{dr(e)|r(e) = w}, and
(ii) if dr(x) = ∞ then x is either a source or receives inﬁnitely many edges,
is called a Drinen range-vector. We construct a new quiver dr(Q) called the in-delayed

quiver of Q for the Drinen range-vector dr as follows:

dr(Q)0 = {vi|v ∈ Q0; 0 ≤ i ≤ dr(v)}, and

dr(Q)1 = Q1 ∪ {f (v)i|1 ≤ i ≤ dr(v)};

and for e ∈ Q1 we deﬁne rdr(Q)(e) = r(e)dr(e) and sdr(Q)(e) = s(e)0. For f (v)i we deﬁne

sdr(Q)(f (v)i) = vi and rdr(Q)(f (v)i) = vi−1.

Corollary 3.26. Let Q be a quiver with ﬁnite number of vertices, ds : Q0 ∪Q1 → N∪{∞}
be a Drinen source-vector and dr : Q0 ∪ Q1 → N ∪ {∞} be a Drinen range-vector.
i) There exists a positive integer n such that Lk(ds(Q)) and Lk(Q) are (1/n)Z-graded
Morita equivalent if and only if ds is proper.

14

A. R. NASR-ISFAHANI

ii) There exists a positive integer n such that Lk(dr(Q)) and Lk(Q) are (1/n)Z-graded
Morita equivalent.

Proof. i) Put Q′0 = Q0, then it is easy to see that if ds is strictly proper, then the
conditions of Theorem 3.1 are satisﬁed. So the result follows by Theorem 3.1. If ds is not
proper, then there are at least two vertices f (v)i, f (v)j with 0 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ ds(v) emitting
inﬁnitely many edges. In this case there is an ideal generated by f (v)i in Lk(ds(Q)) which
was not present in Lk(Q). Then Lk(ds(Q)) is not Morita equivalent (and so is not graded
Morita equivalent) to Lk(Q).
ii) Put Q′0 = Q0, then the result follows by Theorem 3.1.

Deﬁnition 3.27. ([6, Deﬁnition 9.1]) Given a quiver Q, let MnQ be the quiver formed

Deﬁnition 3.29. ([24, Deﬁnition 2.3.10]) Let Q be a quiver and n ≥ 2. The nth higher
edge quiver of Q is a quiver Q[n] with the vertex set equal to the collection of all paths
of length n − 1 in Q, and the edge set containing exactly one edge from e1e2 · · · en−1 to
f1f2 · · · fn−1 whenever e2e3 · · · en−1 = f1f2 · · · fn−2 (or r(e1) = s(f1) if n = 2), and none

The next corollary shows that Corollary 1.4 of [28] is a corollary of Theorem 3.1.

Corollary 3.31. Let Q be a ﬁnite quiver which contain no sinks. Then for all integers
n ≥ 2, Lk(Q) and Lk(Q[n]) are Z-graded Morita equivalent.

Proof. Let Q′ be a quiver with the vertex set Q′0 = Q0 ∪ Q1, and edge set containing
exactly one edge from v ∈ Q0 to e ∈ Q1 whenever s(e) = v, exactly one edge from e ∈ Q1
to v ∈ Q0 whenever r(e) = v, and none otherwise. Then it is easy to see that Q ∼ES Q[2]
via Q′. Q[2] and Q′ are ﬁnite quiver which contain no sinks, and so by Corollary 3.10,
Lk(Q) and Lk(Q[2]) are Z-graded Morita equivalent. An easy computation shows that

(Q[n−1])2 = Q[n], then by induction on n we can see that Lk(Q) and Lk(Q[n]) are Z-graded

(cid:3)

By Theorem 3.1, Proposition 2.3 and results of section 2.3 we have the following corol-

lary:
Corollary 3.32. Let k an arbitrary ﬁeld, Q and Q′ be ﬁnite quivers without sinks such
that one of the following conditions satisfy;

a) Q′ ∼ES Q,
b) Q′ ∼S Q,
c) Q′ = Qr(P) for some partition P of Q1,
d) Q′ = Qs(P) for some partition P of Q1,
e) Q′ = Q\v for some v ∈ Q0 which is a source and not inﬁnite emitter or sink.
f ) Q′ = MnQ for some positive integer n,
g) Q′ = Q[n] for some positive integer n.

Then the following statements hold:

(1) The algebras kQ/J 2 and kQ′/J 2 are singularly equivalent;
(2) The Leavitt path algebras Lk(Q) and Lk(Q′) are derived equivalent;
(3) The opposite Leavitt path algebras Lk(Q)op and Lk(Q′)op are derived equivalent;
(4) There is a triangle equivalence Kac(Inj-kQ/J 2) ∼−→ Kac(Inj-kQ′/J 2);
(5) There is a triangle equivalence Kac(P roj-kQop/J 2) ∼−→ Kac(P roj-kQ′op/J 2).
(6) The categories qgr(kQ) and qgr(kQ′) are equivalent;
(7) The categories QGr(kQ) and QGr(kQ′) are equivalent.

4. Proof of the main theorem

In this section we give the proof of Theorem 3.1. We need the following lemmas in the
proof of Theorem 3.1. In the next lemmas we assume that the conditions of Theorem 3.1
are satisﬁed. The following lemmas are ﬁnite version of [16, Lemma 3.3, Lemma 3.6], we
give the proof for the convenience of reader.

Lemma 4.1. For each v ∈ Q0\Q′0 we have v ≥ Q′0.
Proof. Assume on a contrary that there exists v ∈ Q0\Q′0 such that there is no path in
Path(Q) with source v and range in Q′0. Since v is not a sink, then there exists an edge
µ1 with s(µ1) = v. By assumption r(µ1) ∈ Q0\Q′0 and r(µ1) (cid:3) Q′0. Since Q0 is ﬁnite,
continuing in this way gives a cycle µ = µ1µ2 · · · µn ∈ Path(Q) with s(µi) ∈ Q0\Q′0 for
each i which is a contradiction, and so v ≥ Q′0.
(cid:3)

Let v ∈ Q0. We deﬁne Bv := {µ ∈ Path(Q)\Q0 | s(µ) = v, r(µ) ∈ Q′0 and r(µi) ∈

(ii) If Bv is ﬁnite and Bv 6= ∅, then 0 < |s−1
(iii) Assume that Bv is ﬁnite and nonempty. If {e, w | e ∈ Q1, w ∈ Q0} is a Q-family,

Q (v)| < ∞.

Q0\Q′0 for each 1 ≤ i < |µ|}.
Lemma 4.2. (i) If Bv = ∅ then v ∈ Q′0.

then v =Pα∈Bv αα∗.

16

A. R. NASR-ISFAHANI

Proof. (i) Let v ∈ Q0\Q′0, then by Lemma 4.1 there is a path α ∈ Path(Q) such that
s(α) = v and r(α) ∈ Q′0. Let i be the minimum indices that r(αi) ∈ Q′0, then α1α2 · · · αi ∈
Bv and the result follows.

(ii) Let α ∈ s−1

Q (v). If r(α) ∈ Q′0, then α ∈ Bv, and if r(α) ∈ Q0\Q′0, then by part (i),
Q (v)| < |Bv| < ∞.

there exists β ∈ Br(α) and so αβ ∈ Bv is an extension of α. Thus |s−1
Since Bv 6= ∅, v cannot be a sink and so 0 < |s−1

Q (v)| and the result follows.

(iii) Put l(Bv) := max{|α| : α ∈ Bv}. Since Bv is ﬁnite and nonempty then this
number is well-deﬁned. We use induction on l(Bv). Assume that l(Bv) = 1. We show
that Bv = s−1
Q (v). Since l(Bv) = 1 then each path in Bv is a single edge and so Bv ⊆
s−1

Q (v) and r(e) ∈ Q0\Q′0, then by (i), there exists a
path α ∈ Br(e). Thus eα ∈ Bv is a path of length grater than 2, which is contradiction.
Hence r(e) ∈ Q′0 and so e ∈ Bv. Then Bv = s−1
Q (v) and the CK-2 relation implies that

Q (v) ee∗ = Pα∈Bv αα∗. Now assume that l(Bv) = n and for each w ∈ Q0 with

Lemma 4.3. Let {e, v | e ∈ Q1, v ∈ Q0} be a Q-family in Lk(Q), qv = v for v ∈ Q′0 and
Teα = α for eα ∈ Q′1. Then {Teα, qv | eα ∈ Q′1, v ∈ Q′0} is a Q′-family in Lk(Q′).

eα = T ∗

Proof. The set {qv|v ∈ Q′0} is a set of nonzero mutually orthogonal idempotents because
the set {v|v ∈ Q′0} is. For each eα ∈ Q′1, α ∈ Path(Q) and so s(Teα)Teα = Teαr(Teα)
and r(Teα)T ∗

r(β) ∈ Q′0, which is contradicting α ∈ Bv and so neither one of α, β is an extension

A homogeneous element e of a graded ring A is called full homogeneous idempotent if

e2 = e and AeA = A. The following lemma proved in [20] by R. Hazrat.

Lemma 4.4. ([20, Example 2.]) Let A be a graded ring and e be a full homogeneous
idempotent of A. Then eAe is graded Morita equivalent to A.

Now we are ready to proof our main result. In the proof of the Theorem 3.1 we use the
general idea of [13, Theorem 4.2]. Several authors in [16, Theorem 3.1], [5, Theorem 3.3]
and [20, Proposition 13.] use this idea, but details of proofs case by case are diﬀerent.

Proof of Theorem 3.1. Let A = {µ|µ ∈ Path(Q)\Q0, s(µ), r(µ) ∈ Q′0 and r(µi) ∈ Q0\Q′0
f or 1 ≤ i < l(µ)} and n = max{l(µ)|µ ∈ A}. First we give a (1/n)Z-graded structure
to the Leavitt path algebras Lk(Q′) and Lk(Q). Let G = (1/n)Z and set w(v) = 0 for
each v ∈ Q′0, w(α) = 1 and w(α∗) = −1 for each α ∈ Q′1. Then we obtain a natural
(1/n)Z-grading on Lk(Q′) with the support Z. Set w(v) = 0 for each v ∈ Q0. For any
µ = µ1 · · · µn ∈ A, set w(µi) = 1/n. Now for any µ = µ1 · · · µn−1 ∈ A inductively we
If in the ﬁrst step we set w(µ1) = · · · = w(µj) = 1/n
deﬁne weight of µi for each i.
(after reordering the µi’s if needed) for some j ≤ n − 1, then we set w(µr) = 1/n for
each j + 1 ≤ r ≤ n − 2 and w(µn−1) = 2/n. Otherwise we set w(µi) = 1/n for each
1 ≤ i ≤ n − 2 and w(µn−1) = 2/n. Inductively we obtain the weight of any edge of Q
which lies on some path µ = µ1 · · · µj ∈ A, for some 1 ≤ j ≤ n. For any edge α of Q
which dose not lie on the paths µ = µ1 · · · µj ∈ A, for each 1 ≤ j ≤ n, we set w(α) = 1.
Also for any α ∈ Q1, we set w(α∗) = −w(α). Then we obtain a natural (1/n)Z-grading
on Lk(Q). Note that by this grading for any µ ∈ A, deg(µ) = 1.

Let {e, v | e ∈ Q1, v ∈ Q0} be a Q-family in Lk(Q), qv = v for v ∈ Q′0 and Teα = α
for eα ∈ Q′1. By Lemma 4.3, {Teα, qv | eα ∈ Q′1, v ∈ Q′0} is a Q′-family in Lk(Q′). Put
{eα, v} be the canonical Q′-family. The Universal Homomorphism Property of Lk(Q′)
implies that, there exists a k-algebra homomorphism

π : Lk(Q′) → Lk({Teα, qv})

such that π(eα) = Teα and π(v) = qv, for each eα ∈ Q′1 and v ∈ Q′0. For each eα ∈ Q′1 we
set w(Teα) = 1, w(T ∗
eα) = −1 and for each v ∈ Q′0, we set w(qv) = 0. Then Lk({Teα, qv})
is a Z-graded (also (1/n)Z-graded) algebra. Note that Lk(Q′) is a (1/n)Z-graded algebra
with the support Z. It is not diﬃcult to see that π is a Z-graded ring homomorphism
with π(v) = qv 6= 0 for each v ∈ Q′0. The Graded Uniqueness Theorem [29, Theorem
4.8], implies π is a Z-graded isomorphism. Suppose that Q′0 = {v1, v2 · · · , vm} and
i=1 vi, then e is an idempotent in Lk({Teα, qv}). We claim that eLk(Q)e =
Lk({Teα, qv}). For each v ∈ Q′0, obviously qv = v ∈ eLk(Q)e and for each eα ∈ Q′1,
Teα = eTeαe ∈ eLk(Q)e. Then eLk(Q)e ⊇ Lk({Teα, qv}). Now let λµ∗ ∈ Lk(Q). Suppose
that eλµ∗e 6= 0, then eλµ∗e = λµ∗, s(λ), s(µ) ∈ Q′0 and r(λ) = r(µ). We consider the
following two cases to show that eλµ∗e ∈ Lk({Teα, qv}).

put e = Pm

◦ Case 1: r(λ) ∈ Q′0. We ﬁrst show that λ is a product of paths in Sm

i=1 Bvi. Assume
that λ = λ1λ2 · · · λt.
If t = 1, by deﬁnition of Bv the assertion holds. Now suppose
that the assertion holds for paths of length less than t. If there exists 1 ≤ i < t such
that r(λi) ∈ Q′0, then λ = (λ1 · · · λi)(λi+1 · · · λt) and the result follows by inductive
hypothesis. If there is no such i, then λ ∈ Bs(λ) by deﬁnition. Thus λ ∈ Lk({Teα, qv}).
Since r(µ) = r(λ) ∈ Q′0, the same argument shows that µ ∈ Lk({Teα, qv}) and so eλµ∗e =
λµ∗ ∈ Lk({Teα, qv}).

◦ Case 2: r(λ) ∈ Q0\Q′0. Since r(λ) ∈ Q0\Q′0 and Q0

sing ⊆ Q′0 by deﬁnition of Br(λ),
Br(λ) is a ﬁnite set and by part (i) of Lemma 4.2, Br(λ) 6= ∅. Let j = max{i|s(λi) ∈ Q′0}
and α = λ1 · · · λj−1, β = λj · · · λ|λ|. So we have λ = αβ and s(α), r(α), s(β) ∈ Q′0 and for
each 1 ≤ i ≤ |β|, r(βi) ∈ Q0\Q′0. Similarly we can decompose µ as a product γδ for some
paths γ, δ ∈ Path(Q) with the same properties as α and β, respectively. Case 1 shows
that α, γ ∈ Lk({Teα, qv}). Since Br(λ) is ﬁnite and nonempty, and r(λ) = r(β) = r(δ), by
βη(δη)∗ =
i=1 Bvi. Thus
βδ∗ ∈ Lk({Teα, qv}) and hence λµ∗ is a ﬁnite sum of elements of Lk({Teα, qv}). Then
λµ∗ ∈ Lk({Teα, qv}). Now let a ∈ eLk(Q)e. By [29, Corollary 3.2], each x ∈ Lk(Q) has the
i , such that for each 1 ≤ i ≤ t, αi, βi ∈ Path(Q), r(αi) = r(βi) and
i=1 λi(eαiβ∗
i e ∈ Lk({Teα, qv})

part (iii) of Lemma 4.2 we have βδ∗ = βr(λ)δ∗ = β(Pη∈Br(λ)

λi ∈ k. Thus a =Pt

ηη∗)δ∗ =Pη∈Br(λ)
In the last equation we use the fact that βη, δη ∈ Sm

and so a ∈ Lk({Teα, qv}). Then eLk(Q)e = Lk({Teα, qv}) and our claim follows.

Now we show that Q0 is the hereditary saturated closure of B = {v1, v2 · · · , vm}.
We have Q′0 ⊆ B. Let v ∈ Q0\Q′0, then by part (i) of Lemma 4.2, Bv 6= ∅. The same
argument as in the Case 2 shows that Bv is ﬁnite. Then by Lemma 4.2, 0 < |s−1
Q (v)| < ∞.
Let l(Bv) := max{|α| : α ∈ Bv} as in the proof of Lemma 4.2. By induction on l(Bv)
we show that v ∈ B. If l(Bv) = 1 then the same argument as in the proof of Lemma
4.2 implies that for each α ∈ s−1(v), r(α) ∈ Q′0. Since 0 < |s−1
Q (v)| < ∞, then v ∈ B.
Now suppose that for each w ∈ Q0\Q′0 if 1 ≤ l(Bw) ≤ n then w ∈ B, and assume that
l(Bv) = n + 1 > 1. For each α ∈ s−1(v), we have either r(α) ∈ Q0 or r(α) ∈ Q0\Q′0.
Suppose that r(α) ∈ Q0\Q′0, then by Lemma 4.2, Br(α) 6= ∅ and so l(Br(α)) ≥ 1. Thus
1 ≤ l(Br(α)) ≤ n, since each path β ∈ Br(α) gives a path αβ ∈ Bv with length |β| + 1
and hence r(α) ∈ B by inductive hypothesis. Then for any edge α ∈ s−1(v), r(α) ∈ B,
and so v ∈ B, since v is regular. Thus Q0\Q′0 ⊆ B and so Q0 is the hereditary saturated
i=1 Lk(Q)viLk(Q) = Lk(Q) and
so e = v1 + · · · + vm is a full homogeneous idempotent of Lk(Q). Then by Lemma 4.4,
Lk(Q) and eLk(Q)e are (1/n)Z-graded Morita equivalent. Thus Lk(Q) and Lk(Q′) are
(1/n)Z-graded Morita equivalent and the result follows.
