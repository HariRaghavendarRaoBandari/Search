Abstract. We study the eﬀect of a non-Abelian SU (2) gauge potential on the
topological semimetal induced by a magnetic ﬁeld having π-ﬂux per plaquette and
acting on fermions in a cubic lattice. The Abelian π-ﬂux term gives rise to a spectrum
characterized by Weyl points. When the non-Abelian part is turned on, due to the
presence of a C4 rotation symmetry, the Weyl points assume a quadratic dispersion
along two directions and constitute double monopoles for the Berry curvature. We
examine both analytically and numerically the main features of this system, focusing
on its gapless surface modes, the so-called Fermi arcs. We discuss the stability
of the system under conﬁning hard-wall and harmonic potentials, relevant for the
implementation in ultracold atom settings, and the eﬀect of rotation symmetry
breaking.

1. Introduction

The study of topological phases of matter and the structure of their energy bands have
been very active ﬁelds of research in the last decade [1–5]. Prominent examples of
gapless systems displaying topological features are topological semimetals, in which
the band structure mimics the main properties of the critical points of topological
insulators and superconductors. This is the case of the so-called Weyl semimetals [6–8]
in three space dimensions (3D): gapless systems characterized by non-trivial boundary
phenomena protected by topological properties of their bands. These systems present
zero-energy bulk modes with linear dispersion, called Weyl nodes, which are protected
against generic local perturbations of the Hamiltonian.

The Weyl nodes have a topological origin since they constitute monopoles of
the Berry curvature of the bandstructure. This guarantees their stability against
perturbations and gives rise to protected gapless surface modes, called Fermi arcs, that
connect the projections of the Weyl nodes on the surface Brillouin zone [6]. Beside
the usual Weyl semimetals, characterized by a linear dispersion of the Weyl nodes, the
introduction of extra rotational symmetries in the system can lead to the formation
of more exotic states. In this case, the band-touching points can be characterized by
quadratic or cubic dispersion relations, and constitute monopoles of higher charges for
the Berry connection [9].

Weyl nodes can be obtained by breaking either time-reversal or spatial inversion
symmetry. The recent experimental realizations of Weyl semimetals are based on the
breaking of spatial inversion symmetry, in compounds such as tantalum arsenide [10–12]
and niobium arsenide [13]. In similar experiments, the appearance of gapless Fermi arcs
was observed on the surface of compounds like semimetal bismuth trisodium [14] and
tantalum arsenide [12] through photoemission measurements. Beside these solid state
setups, an alternative experimental realization of Weyl points, similarly based on the
breaking of space-inversion symmetry, was obtained in photonic crystals [15]. So far, no
physical realization of Weyl semimetals has been implemented by breaking time-reversal
symmetry, but several theoretical proposals have been presented in this direction. They
include the use of magnetic impurities [7], complex next-nearest-neighbour hoppings in
cubic lattices [16], or particular patterns of staggered magnetic ﬁelds [17–19].

A diﬀerent strategy to achieve a Weyl semimetal is to use, in a tight-binding model
of fermions on a cubic lattice, a magnetic ﬁeld such that the ﬂux per plaquette is
π [20,21]. This model, which is the 3D counterpart of the 2D model presented in [22], is
relevant for the implementation of conical band-touching points in the energy spectrum
of ultracold fermions subject to an artiﬁcial gauge potential [23]. For ultracold gases
the magnetic ﬁeld is indeed synthetic and can be simulated in a number of ways [24]. A
recent proposal to realize a π-ﬂux per plaquette in 3D lattices of ultracold fermions is
based on space-dependent phases obtained through laser-assisted tunneling which could
be implemented with the current technology [25].

On the theoretical side, this is one of the simplest conceptual realizations of a

Weyl semimetal, since it is obtained in a cubic lattice through a simple Abelian gauge
potential corresponding to a uniform magnetic ﬁeld. Its possible realization in ultracold
atoms loaded in optical lattices would allow to reach the required large values of the ﬂux,
which are diﬃcult to implement in the usual solid state scenarios. Another advantage
of considering similar ultracold atom systems is that in these setups one can also study
generalizations of the Abelian π-ﬂux model that involve artiﬁcial non-Abelian gauge
potentials [24], as well as the eﬀects of a spin-momentum coupling independent on the
position.

In this paper we explore the eﬀects of a non-Abelian SU (2) gauge potential on
the topological properties of Weyl semimetals. Such a potential mimics the eﬀect of
a spin-orbit coupling involving only two momentum components. Similar to a Rashba
or Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling, it has an anisotropic nature: the motion on the ˆz
direction is decoupled from the spin.

In previous works, theoretical investigations showed that synthetic non-Abelian
gauge potentials are an eﬃcient way of implementing exotic quantum Hall systems
[26–32] or topological phases [33–37] in two-dimensional lattices, and that laser assisted
tunneling may provide useful tools for the simulation of particles like massless Dirac
fermions [27], Wilson fermions [38] or Weyl fermions [39].

Here we consider the case of Weyl semimetals in three dimensions subject to SU (2)
gauge potentials and we examine how a spin-orbit coupling modiﬁes the Weyl fermion
physics of cubic lattices in the presence of a π-ﬂux in each plaquette [23, 25]. The
models we analyze are tight-binding Hamiltonians of two-component fermions in cubic
lattices with nearest-neighbor hopping only. Such three-dimensional models are well-
suited to describe the behavior of ultracold fermionic gases loaded in optical lattices and
subject to artiﬁcial non-Abelian gauge potentials (see, for example, [40, 41]) which act
on the inner components of the atoms. In turn, these cold atom systems can be realized
experimentally following several techniques, ranging from laser-assisted tunneling to
lattice modulations. Recent advances in the realization of two-dimensional gauge
potentials and topological phases of matter [42–49] pave the way for the implementation
of three-dimensional models as well, representing diﬀerent gapped and gapless phases.
Our work is organized as follows. In Section 2 we brieﬂy review the cubic lattice
model with π-ﬂuxes, known to host Weyl points. In Section 3 we add a uniform non-
Abelian gauge potential, mimicking the eﬀect of spin-orbit coupling, and we describe
the spectrum and symmetries of the system. The latter shows two inequivalent double-
Weyl points, discussed in Subsection 3.1, as allowed by the C4 rotational symmetry of
the model. After discussing the properties of the Weyl points, in the Subsections 3.2
and 3.3 we focus on the numerical and analytical study of surface modes (Fermi arcs)
in the presence of hard-wall trapping potentials. In Subsection 3.4 we investigate the
eﬀect of a non-Abelian potential with broken rotational symmetry. In Subsection 3.5
we analyze the eﬀect of a harmonic trapping potential, usually present in cold atom
experiments. We ﬁnally summarize our ﬁndings in Section 4. Further calculations are
presented in Appendix A and Appendix B, where we calculate the Berry charge for a

double-Weyl point and discuss the eﬀect of gauge symmetry breaking.

2. Cubic lattice with π ﬂuxes

A well-known strategy to achieve Weyl points in a cubic lattice model is to introduce a
gauge potential corresponding to a π-ﬂux in each square plaquette.
In this Section
we review the main properties of tight-binding Hamiltonian for fermions subjected
to such a magnetic ﬁeld. This model has been studied extensively, see for example
[20, 21, 23, 25, 50]. We consider a single species of (polarized) fermions, while two-
component fermionic mixtures will be considered in the next Section.

Consider the Abelian vector potential in the Hasegawa gauge [21]:

(cid:126)AAB = π (z − y, y − z, 0) ,

(1)

where the lattice spacing is set to 1 for simplicity. The resulting magnetic ﬁeld is
(cid:126)B = π (1, 1, 1), so that each lattice plaquette is pierced by a ﬂux π. The tight-binding
Hamiltonian of this system reads

H = −ω

(cid:90) (cid:126)r+ˆj

(cid:126)r and c(cid:126)r are fermionic creation and annihilation operators at lattice site (cid:126)r, ω is

where c

θj ((cid:126)r) =

(cid:126)AAB ((cid:126)r) · d(cid:126)r .

(3)

(cid:126)r

Using Eq. (1) in Eq. (3) one gets θx = π (z − y), θy = π (y − z) + π/2 and θz = 0.
To describe this system in the translationally invariant case,
it is useful to adopt
the Hasegawa approach [21] by using a basis deﬁned in momentum space: we divide
the Hamiltonian in 2 × 2 sub-blocks by considering pairs of states {kx, ky, kz} and
{kx, ky + π, kz − π}. In this basis the 2 × 2 Hamiltonian can be rewritten as

H((cid:126)k) = −2ωτx cos kx + 2ωτy cos ky − 2ωτz cos kz ,

(4)

where τi are Pauli matrices and (cid:126)k are in the magnetic Brillouin zone [51]. With the
gauge choice (1) we can choose kx ∈ [−π, π), ky ∈ [−π, π), and kz ∈ [0, π). The
eigenstates of τx label the even and odd sublattices in the ˆy− ˆz plane respectively. Only
one dimension of the Brillouin zone can be halved, reﬂecting the fact that the states
come in pairs and, to obtain the cosine terms, we had to sum the two coupled states
{kx, ky, kz} and {kx, ky + π, kz − π} corresponding to equivalent points in the Brillouin
2 (±1,±1, 1). Notice that these
zone. The spectrum of Eq. (4) shows Weyl points at π
Weyl points are stable also when an anisotropy is introduced in the hopping amplitudes:
H((cid:126)k) = −2ωxτx cos kx + 2ωyτy cos ky − 2ωzτz cos kz. The system remains a semimetal
also when local attractive interactions are added, up to a critical value of the interaction

strength due to the vanishing density of states [52], as discussed in a variety of 2D and
3D lattices, including the 3D π-ﬂux model [53].

We observe that the Weyl nodes can be obtained by breaking either time-reversal or
spatial inversion symmetry, considered in their canonical (translational invariant) form.
However, it has been shown that in systems with local gauge symmetries the breakdown
of the canonical time-reversal (T ) or spatial inversion (P) symmetry does not imply
in general a breaking of the corresponding physical symmetries [50].
In this case it
is possible to engineer Weyl semimetals whose dynamics is invariant under both the
physical symmetries. In the following we are going to denote by P and T the physical
symmetries. We refer to [50] for a discussion of the diﬀerence between canonical and
physical time- and space-reversal symmetry for the Abelian π-ﬂux potential.

3. The anisotropic SU (2) model

A rich phenomenology is obtained by the introduction of a non-Abelian term in the
gauge potential. To this purpose, we consider a two-component mixture of fermions on
a cubic lattice subject to the vector potential

(cid:126)A ≡ (cid:126)AAB + (cid:126)ANAB ≡ π (z − y, y − z, 0) σ0 + q(σx, σy, 0) ,

(5)

where σi are Pauli matrices characterizing the two components of the inner degree of
freedom of the atoms. The Abelian term (cid:126)AAB is the gauge potential considered in the
previous Section, given by Eq. (1), which now contains the 2 × 2 identity matrix σ0.
The parameter q determines the intensity of the non-Abelian term (cid:126)ANAB, [37] which is
gauge equivalent to both a 2D Rashba and a Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling.

The experimental realization of 3D optical lattices characterized by appropriate
magnetic ﬂuxes may be obtained through suitable laser-assisted tunneling in all the
three directions (see, for example, [25]). Engineering the SU (2) potential however, seems
to be a more challenging task. There exists a proposal to create such potentials in the
absence of a lattice [54]. Several theoretical works have focused instead on the realization
of SU (2) potentials based on laser-assisted tunneling amplitudes among diﬀerent inner
species [55] (see also the review [56] and references therein) or shaking techniques [57].
In Eq. (5) the Pauli matrices σi refer to the (pseudo)spin 1/2 degree of freedom,
which may represent diﬀerent hyperﬁne levels in ultracold atomic setups in optical
lattices (see [24, 41] for reviews about artiﬁcial gauge potentials in ultracold atomic
systems). However, this pseudospin could also be interpreted as associated to a further
sublattice degree of freedom if we consider a 3D structure composed by layers of
honeycomb lattices such as the ones realized experimentally using shaking techniques.
In this case the SU (2) non-Abelian potential can be obtained as the eﬀect of next-
nearest-neighbor hopping with particular phases.

The potential (5) produces a system obeying the same discrete symmetries as in the
Abelian case. The system Hamiltonian can be written in terms of generalized tunneling

U z = 1 .

(9)
The canonical time-reversal symmetry T corresponds to a transformation (cid:126)A → − (cid:126)A,
which maps U j → U j†. The initial and ﬁnal Hamiltonians are however related by a U (2)
gauge transformation Uyc(cid:126)r,s = (σz)s,s(cid:48) eiπyc(cid:126)r,s(cid:48), such that the equation T HT † = U†
y HUy
holds. Therefore, T ≡ UyT = σz eiπyT deﬁnes the physical time-reversal transformation.
The spatial inversion symmetry is instead given by the real-space transformation:

z → 1/2 − z ,

y → 1/2 − y ,

x → 1/2 − x ,

(10)
which leaves all phases θj unchanged, since eiπ(z−y) = e−iπ(z−y). Therefore P = P , P
being the physical space inversion symmetry, and H = P †HP .

Using the same Brillouin zone as in the Abelian model, the momentum space form

of the Hamiltonian in Eq. (6) reads

H((cid:126)k)
= − cos q cos kxτx +cos q cos kyτy−cos kzτz +sin q sin kxτx⊗σx−sin q sin kyτy⊗σy .
2ω
(11)
This Hamiltonian can be put in a more symmetric form by a momentum shift kx →
kx + π, equivalent to a gauge transformation.
In this way a Dresselhaus spin-orbit
coupling in its standard form is also obtained. Moreover it becomes explicit that the
model in Eq. (11) displays a C4 symmetry corresponding to rotations of angles π/2
around the ˆz axis (including a rotation of both (cid:126)σ and (cid:126)τ ).

Diagonalizing (11) we obtain the following eigenvalues:

sin2 q(cid:0)4 − 2 cos2 q(cos 4kx + cos 4ky) − 4 sin2 q (cos 2kx + cos 2ky − cos 2kx cos 2ky)(cid:1) .

(13)
The spectrum is composed of four sub-bands, two having positive and two negative
energy, linked by a particle-hole symmetry C = τy ⊗ σyK, with K complex conjugation,
such that Eq. (11) transforms as:

H((cid:126)k) = −C H∗(−(cid:126)k)C−1 .

Furthermore, a unitary parity operation is implemented by the operator σz:

The two-dimensional limit of the model in Eq. (6) can be addressed considering
diﬀerent hopping ωj in the diﬀerent directions and then simply sending to zero the
hopping amplitude ωz along ˆz, ωz → 0,
in all the resulting expressions for the
Hamiltonian and their energies. Keeping ωx = ωy ≡ ω we do not break the C4 rotational
symmetry and we ﬁnd that the anisotropic model of Eq. (11) with ωz → 0 is equivalent,
√
via the unitary global transformation U = (τz + τy)/
2 to the model studied in [37] in
the case of Abelian ﬂux π. This mapping corresponds to the transformation from the

Hasegawa to the Landau gauge in real space: (cid:126)A → (cid:126)A − (cid:126)∇(cid:0)(z − y)x + y2

2 − zy(cid:1). In this

2D limit a canonical time-reversal symmetry is deﬁned as T = τxσyK. The system is
then in the topologically non-trivial symmetry class DIII [1, 4, 5, 58] but it is a gapless
system, corresponding to a thermal metal [59] or semimetal phase.

3.1. Double-Weyl points

0

= π

In the presence of the non-Abelian term (cid:126)AN AB the two central bands touch at zero
2 (±1,±1, 1) of the Brillouin zone. Unlike the Abelian
energy in the points (cid:126)k(±,±)
case, the energy dispersion around these Weyl nodes is quadratic in the ˆkx − ˆky plane,
whereas it remains linear in the ˆkz direction. Therefore such nodes are called double-
Weyl points [9]. They can be shown to be the fusion of two simple Weyl points into
a double monopole of the Berry ﬂux with charge Q = ±2 (see Appendix A) and they
appear due to the C4 symmetry of the Hamiltonian (11). If this rotational symmetry
is broken by a small perturbation, the double-Weyl points split into two single Weyl
points. We refer to [9] for a detailed study of the multi-Weyl points stabilized by point
group symmetries and to [60] for a numerical analysis of a compound of strontium
silicide, where double-Weyl points appear due to a weak spin-orbit coupling, similar to
the non-Abelian gauge potential we consider.

The zero-energy points appear only when the τz term in Eq. (11) vanishes, thus
for kz = π/2. To show this, we can decompose the Hamiltonian (11) into two anti-
commuting parts, H = Hxy (kx, ky) + Hz (kz) with Hz = −2ωτz cos kz, such that
{Hxy, Hz} = 0. This implies that the term Hz couples pairs of eigenstates of Hxy
with opposite eigenenergies ±εxy. Therefore, in order to obtain eigenstates of the full
Hamiltonian at zero energy, we must consider, on one side, pairs of eigenstates of Hxy
with εxy = 0 and, on the other, a vanishing operator Hz. Otherwise, a gap would open
between the two states in each pair (see more details in [61]).

To examine the system in the proximity of the double-Weyl points it is useful to
apply a perturbative approach and expand the Hamiltonian in series of the momenta
In this way we deﬁne an eﬀective 2 × 2 Hamiltonian which

approximates the behavior of the two intermediate energy bands in a neighborhood
of the band-touching points.

the x-direction, at x = 0 and x = 120a. We set q = π/4, and kz = π/2. The color
scale shows the eigenstate amplitude on the ﬁrst and last 12 sites from the boundaries.
Double-Weyl nodes with opposite chirality overlap in the surface Brillouin zone, causing
their Fermi arcs to interact and acquire a non-trivial dispersion. Only half of the
Brillouin zone is shown, since the dispersion is symmetric for ky → −ky.

For simplicity, we focus on the point (cid:126)k = {π/2, π/2, π/2}. In the basis |τzσz(cid:105), the
states |↑↓(cid:105),|↓↑(cid:105) have vanishing energy at the double-Weyl point, whereas the states
|↑↑(cid:105) ± |↓↓(cid:105) have an energy ±2ω sin q. Once we expand all the terms in the momenta
to second order, we may consider the Hamiltonian as a perturbation of the trivial
Hamiltonian H = 0 for the two states.
In the basis of the two intermediate bands,
this eﬀective Hamiltonian reads:

(cid:16)˜k2

˜kx

˜kyτy + 2ω˜kzτz,

(16)

where ˜ki = ki − π/2.

It can be shown that Heﬀ deﬁnes, in proximity of the point (cid:126)k = (π/2, π/2, π/2), a
magnetic monopole of charge 2 for the Berry ﬂux (see Appendix A). Therefore, similarly
to the conventional Weyl semimetals [6], it is expected to give rise to unconventional
protected zero-energy surface states.

3.2. Zero-energy Fermi arcs and breaking of the gauge symmetry

For both the Abelian and non-Abelian gauge-invariant models, the eﬀect of a surface
orthogonal to the ˆz direction is trivial: no gapless surface mode can appear for a surface
at z = 0, as can be shown by an explicit calculation in the presence of a hard-wall
potential. In contrast, surfaces orthogonal to either ˆx or ˆy (the two cases are rotationally
equivalent) present two localized surface modes which emerge from the projection of the
double-Weyl points on the surface Brillouin zone. However, these states interact in
pairs due to the overlap of double-Weyl points with opposite chirality, and no protected
zero-energy Fermi arcs appear (see Fig. 1).

Figure 2. Bandstructure in an inﬁnite slab geometry with hard-wall boundary
conditions at x − y = 0 and x − y = 120a, using the same parameters and the same
conventions as Fig. 1. Double-Weyl points of the same chirality overlap in the surface
Brillouin zone, and are connected by zero-energy Fermi arcs.

The overlap of double Weyl points in the ˆkx and ˆky directions is caused by two
symmetries of the Hamiltonian in Eq. (11), which can be expressed as translations by
π in momentum space. We get

H (kx, ky, kz) = −τxH (kx + π, ky, kz) τx ,
H (kx, ky, kz) = −τyH (kx, ky + π, kz) τy .

(17)

(18)

These transformations relate Weyl points with opposite chirality through a translation
along ˆkx or ˆky. Thus, for each double Weyl point, there exists a symmetric point which
shares either the same kx or ky coordinate. Further reﬂection symmetries characterize
the Hamiltonian (11) and entail the same eﬀect (see Appendix B for more details).

Therefore, the system described by the potential (5) presents zero-energy Fermi
arcs only on surfaces that are not orthogonal to the main lattice directions. In Fig. 2
we show the band structure of the Hamiltonian (6) on an inﬁnite slab oriented along
the ˆx + ˆy diagonal direction, with hard-wall boundaries at x − y = 0 and 120a. In this
case only Weyl points with the same chirality overlap, leading to protected zero-energy
Fermi arcs connecting their projections on the surface Brillouin zone and localized on
the boundaries of the system.

In order to obtain protected zero-energy Fermi arcs also on surfaces deﬁned along
the main lattice directions for either x = 0 or y = 0, it is necessary to break the previous
symmetries (17) and (18). Since they are independent on (cid:126)σ, these symmetries are left
untouched when varying the SU (2) component of the gauge potential (5). The situation
becomes diﬀerent if we instead consider the introduction of an additional term which
breaks the SU (2) gauge invariance and, therefore, the physical time-reversal symmetry.
The system is then no longer a P T invariant Weyl semimetal, but a usual Weyl

semimetal with broken T . An example is given by the perturbation Hxx ≡ hxσx ⊗ τx,
corresponding to a staggered Zeeman term

Hxx = hxσx cos [π(y − z)] ,

(19)

which may be realized by considering optical lattices tuned close to appropriate anti-
magic wave-lengths [55].

This perturbation is invariant under the spatial inversion in Eq. (10), but breaks
instead the physical time-reversal symmetry UyT . The term Hxx commutes with Hxy
at the double Weyl points and anti-commutes with Hz, thus avoiding the opening of an
energy gap at the band-touching points. Additionally, Hxx breaks both the translational
symmetries along kx of the kind (17), as well as the kx-reﬂection symmetries listed in
Appendix B. Therefore it leads to the formation of Fermi arcs on surfaces orthogonal
to the ˆx direction, as seen in Fig. 3.

Finally we notice that Hxx breaks both the canonical particle-hole symmetry C and
the C4 rotational symmetry around the ˆz axis. Therefore all the double Weyl points
split into pairs of Weyl points as shown in Fig. 4.

3.3. Fermi arcs wavefunction

In the presence of the staggered Zeeman term (19) and of a boundary on the system
orthogonal to either ˆx or ˆy, the existence of the Fermi arcs can be shown analytically.
For this purpose we start from the Hamiltonian:
Hxy + Hxx = − cos q cos kxτx ⊗ σ0 + cos q cos kyτy ⊗ σ0+

+ (sin q sin kx + hx) τx ⊗ σx − sin q sin kyτy ⊗ σy ,

(20)

in which we ﬁxed ω = 1/2 for the sake of simplicity and kz = π/2 since it is a necessary
requirement to obtain a vanishing energy due to the condition Hz = 0.

Figure 4. Energy of the two intermediate bands in the presence of the staggered
Zeeman term for kz = π/2, q = π/4, h = 1/3. The Zeeman term splits the double-
Weyl points in such a way that there are pairs of Weyl points that do not overlap once
projected in the ˆkx direction. For clarity only half of the Brillouin zone is shown.

First, we show that there are Weyl points located at kx = −π/2 which have no
counterpart at kx = π/2. For kx = −π/2 the Hamiltonian takes the block oﬀ-diagonal

det A(ky) = − cos2 q + sin2 ky − (h − sin q)2 = 0

sin ky = ±(cid:112)

we get:

h2 − 2h sin q + 1 .

(24)
If h < 2 sin q (we consider 0 < q < π) four Weyl points appear for kx = −π/2. It is
easy to verify that such Weyl points have no counterpart for kx = π/2 (see Fig. 4), and
therefore do not overlap with other band-touching points once projected on a surface
Brillouin zone along ˆkx.

To ﬁnd an approximate expression for the Fermi arc wavefunctions appearing on
the surface at x = 0, we adopt the approach discussed in [61, 62], starting from the
Hamiltonian (20). We expand it to ﬁrst order in kx in a neighborhood of the Weyl
points at kx = −π/2 and then substitute kx = −i∂x, since translational invariance

The Fermi arc wavefunctions are zero-energy eigenstates for the Hamiltonian Hxy.
By considering a value kz (cid:54)= π/2, however, they acquire a dispersion given by Hz =
−2ωτz cos kz.

The approximate solution of Eq. (31) relies on the ﬁrst order expansion of the
Hamiltonian in kx and, for example, it is not in exact agreement with Eq. (24), which
deﬁnes the correct extension of the Fermi arcs in ky. Furthermore we emphasize that
the Fermi arcs appear for h < 2 sin q, as deduced from Eq. (24) and not for h < sin q
as predicted by (30). However, the approximate solution Eq. (31) allows to verify
analytically the existence of the zero-energy Fermi arcs and gives a good description
of these surface states when q (cid:28) π/2 and h < 0. In this case both the exponential
decay and the oscillatory term properly match the numerical results (see Fig. 5). By
increasing q the oscillatory term is only qualitatively captured, and its decay length
does not match the numerical solution.

obtained in an inﬁnite slab geometry of thickness Lx = 800, with q = 0.2 and h = −0.05
at momenta ky = π/2 + 0.02 and kz = π/2 using the Hamiltonian (11). The thick
black curve is the analytic result (31). For small values of q and negative h Eq. (31)
provides a good approximation of the Fermi arcs wavefunctions.

3.4. Eﬀect of the breaking of rotational symmetry on double-Weyl points and Fermi
arcs

We saw above that double-Weyl points occur for arbitrary intensity of the non-Abelian
gauge ﬁeld (cid:126)ANAB in (5). However, a central ingredient for the emergence of double-Weyl
points is C4 rotational symmetry around the ˆz axis which implies that the coeﬃcient in
front of σx and σy in (5) must be the same for the two components.

In real experiments, however, this assumption can be violated. For this reason
it is important to examine the eﬀect of a weak perturbation breaking the rotational
symmetry. Such anisotropy can be modelled by the new vector potential:

(cid:126)A = π (z − y, y − z, 0) σ0 + (qx σx, qy σy, 0) ,

(32)

where we consider in general qx (cid:54)= qy.

Similarly to the previous situation deﬁned by (5), a closed expression for the
four energy bands resulting from (32) can be obtained, but the ﬁnal formula for the
eigenenergies is rather complicated and not particularly enlightening. Therefore, we
will not give it here, limiting instead the discussion to its main features.

The main result is that, as expected, for small anisotropies qx ≈ qy, each double-
Weyl point splits into two inequivalent single Weyl points with linear dispersion,
separated along the direction corresponding to the largest between |qx| and |qy|. A
typical situation is shown in Fig. 6.

In this case, the Fermi arcs of the double-Weyl points in a diagonal slab split into
two Fermi arcs, partially overlapping and related to the single-Weyl points. Since the
two Weyl points are generated by the same double-Weyl node, and therefore have the

Figure 6. Splitting of a double-Weyl point in two single-Weyl points in presence of

splitting of one double-Weyl cone is shown.

same charge, there cannot be any detrimental interactions between these Fermi arcs,
and the latter are pinned to zero energy.

For small perturbations given by δq = |qx − qy|, as the ones coming from
imperfections in real experiments, we ﬁnd that the distance between the Weyl points
is linear in δq. This implies that in realistic setups such a perturbation could be
controlled to be negligible with respect to the adopted detection techniques. The same
considerations apply to the Fermi arcs.

We observe that a similar phenomenology would be generated by the introduction
In the case ωx (cid:54)= ωy the

of diﬀerent hopping amplitudes in the ˆx and ˆy directions.
rotational symmetry is indeed trivially broken.

Concerning the experimental observations of single and double Weyl points in
ultracold atom settings, the main tools available with current ultracold-atom technology
rely on the possibility of detecting the shape of the energy bands and the Berry curvature
as a function of the momenta. Regarding the band mapping, several techniques,
including Bragg spectroscopy, have already been successfully applied in 1D and 2D
systems (see the general technology in [63] or the notable recent detection of 2D Dirac
cones in an experimental set-up [64]). Also the detection of Berry curvatures has
been already applied to several 2D systems: these observations include interferometric
experiments [65] and measurments of the population in diﬀerent energy bands [66], also
in the case of non-Abelian Berry connections in two-band systems [67]. Once extended
in a 3D setup, this would allow a direct measurement of the Berry monopole for both
single and multi-Weyl points.

3.5. Zero-energy states in the presence of a harmonic trap

The experimental setups of ultracold atomic gases loaded in optical lattices is usually
based on either harmonic trapping potentials or the implementation of a hard-wall
conﬁnement for the atoms obtained through optical box traps [68] or light-intensity

Double Weyl points and Fermi arcs of topological semimetals in...

15

masks [69, 70]. It is therefore interesting to examine the behaviour of the zero-energy
modes in the presence of both these potentials and to evaluate how they are related to
the double-Weyl points.

By trapping the atoms in this way, the sharp box-shaped potentials allow us to
deﬁne precise surfaces for the system, whereas the role of a weak harmonic trapping can
be assimilated to a space-dependent chemical potential in a local density approximation
regime.

We assume the previous diagonal slab geometry with a harmonic potential which

depends only on the distance from the center. The single-particle Hamiltonian is

Htrap = H + m Ω2(x − y)2/2 − µ,

(33)

where H is given by Eq. (6). In the central part of the trap the harmonic potential is
negligible and for values of the chemical potential such that 0 < µ (cid:46) 2ω the system is
in a metallic phase with the two lowest bands fully occupied and the third band only
partially ﬁlled. In a local approximation, the Fermi surface with zero energy corresponds
to a set of closed lines around the double-Weyl points.

By increasing the distance |x−y| from the center, the harmonic potential eﬀectively
reduces the local chemical potential. Therefore, the Fermi surface shrinks at ﬁrst towards
the double-Weyl points, until a distance such that m Ω2(x − y)2 = 2µ where only the
double-Weyl points remain as zero-energy states. Moving further towards the surfaces,
the system is again in a metallic phase, now with the second band partially ﬁlled.
Here the zero-energy modes deﬁne larger and larger contours around the band-touching
points. Finally, on the hard-wall boundary at |x − y| = L, zero-energy surface modes
appear. Their energy can be roughly estimated by:

Hsurface ≈ −2ωτz cos kz − µ + mΩ2L2/2.

(34)
This dispersion relation implies that the Fermi arcs are shifted by ±δkz from their
previous momentum kz = π/2 in order to compensate for the trapping energy. This
approximation however fails when properly considering the penetration of the surface
modes in the bulk.

In Fig. 7 we plot the states around zero energy on the surface Brillouin zone for
the diagonal slab geometry. We used a value of the trapping Ω such that the local
chemical potential ranges from µ to −µ with µ < ω. Our numerical results show
that the gapless surface states interpolate, with curved shapes, between the zero-energy
Fermi surfaces surrounding the projections of the double-Weyl points, as emerging from
previous discussions [6, 62].

This is the expected result as long as the trapping is weak enough in such a way
that on the boundary of the system the local chemical potential still falls within the
second band. At variance, if the trapping increases further such that µ (cid:38) ω, all the
surface Brillouin zone will be covered by bulk zero-energy states, and the boundary of
the system will be locally found in a gapped phase corresponding to an insulator, where

Figure 7. In the top part of the ﬁgure we plot in the surface Brillouin zone the states
with energy |E| < 0.02ω in the presence of a harmonic trapping potential. We use an
inﬁnite slab geometry with boundaries at x−y = 0 and 80a. The color scale depicts the
eigenstate intensity on the ﬁrst and last 8 sites from the boundaries. The parameters
Ω and µ are chosen in order to have the potential energy ranging from −0.5ω to +0.5ω
from the center of the system towards the surface. The double-Weyl points become
extended regions of bulk states with zero energy, which are connected by Fermi arcs,
bent by the harmonic trap. For comparison, the states without the harmonic trap are
shown in the lower part of the ﬁgure.

only the ﬁrst band is ﬁlled. Even larger values of Ω can then lead to the appearance
of a new metallic phase corresponding to a partial ﬁlling of the ﬁrst band close to the
boundary.

The zero-energy Fermi surfaces, appearing directly as states in the Brillouin zone,
can be experimentally probed through a band mapping based on Bragg spectroscopy
[63], analogously to the bulk states (see the end of Subsection 3.4).

4. Outlook

A ﬂourishing research activity about Weyl semimetals is developing in the last few years
with the aim of proposing and experimentally realizing these systems and classifying
the various types of Weyl nodes (see, e.g., the very recent work [71]).
In this paper
we analyzed the eﬀects of a non-Abelian gauge potential on a system of two-species
fermions moving in a cubic lattice with nearest neighbor hopping only. We considered
in particular the case of an U (2) potential describing both a π magnetic ﬂux in each
plaquette and a spin-orbit coupling. When the non-Abelian component of the potential
preserves a C4 rotation symmetry along the ˆz axis, the system is characterized by double-
Weyl-points. These are zero-energy band-touching points with a quadratic dispersion
along two directions, and correspond to double monopoles for the Berry connection. Our
ﬁndings provide a useful and simple analytical model for their realization and conﬁrm

the numerical results showing that the introduction of a suitable spin-orbit coupling can
lead to the formation of double-Weyl points [60].

The double-Weyl points lead to the formation of peculiar surface states.

In a
slab geometry oriented in a diagonal direction in the xy plane, pairs of zero-energy
Fermi arcs originate from each of these zero-energy bulk states. When the boundary
is instead orthogonal to one of the main directions, ˆx or ˆy, the surface modes interact
and acquire a non-trivial dispersion. In this case, in order to obtain Fermi arcs, the
breakdown of the speciﬁc symmetries is required. This can be achieved, for instance, by
an additional staggered Zeeman term. However, the latter also breaks the translational
and C4 rotational symmetries, splitting the double-Weyl points in pairs of single-Weyl
ones.

In the same way, any anisotropy breaking the C4 rotational symmetry leads to a
splitting of the double-Weyl points. However, we expect that the amount of anisotropy
occurring in real experiments is small, and does not lead to sensible diﬀerence from the
behaviour characteristic of these points.

We ﬁnally analyzed the eﬀects of the harmonic trapping, showing that it leads to
the formation of topological metals with non-trivial Fermi surfaces, while preserving the
zero-energy surface modes.

Appendix A. Double-Weyl points as Berry monopoles

The eﬀective Hamiltonian (16) describes the two internal bands in a neighborhood of
one of the double-Weyl points and it allows to evaluate an approximated behavior of
their associated Fermi arcs. The double-Weyl points are monopoles with charge two of
the Berry ﬂux associated to each of the two central bands. In order to show this we
consider the particular case of q = π/4 and we evaluate the ﬁeld F = (cid:126)∇ × (cid:126)A related to
the Berry connection Aj = −i(cid:104)ψ|∂˜kj
ψ(cid:105) calculated from the eﬀective Hamiltonian (16).

By integrating the ﬂux of F for a closed surface around the Weyl point in (cid:126)k =

Appendix B. Overlap of the double-Weyl points and symmetries

The overlap of double-Weyl points on the surface Brillouin zone along the canonical
directions of the lattice is caused by the symmetries of the Hamiltonian (11), including
the momentum translations in (17) and (18). Here we focus on the plane where the
Weyl points lie, kz = π/2, and list the symmetries of Hxy that must be broken to avoid
such overlaps.
First, there are anti-commuting reﬂection symmetries which map either kx → −kx

or ky → −ky:

Hxy (kx, ky) = −τzσyHxy (−kx, ky) τzσy ,
Hxy (kx, ky) = −τzσxHxy (kx,−ky) τzσx .

(B.1)

(B.2)

Then we must consider commuting reﬂection symmetries corresponding to the same
reﬂections:

Hxy (kx, ky) = σyHxy (−kx, ky) σy ,
Hxy (kx, ky) = σxHxy (kx,−ky) σx .

(B.3)

(B.4)

Finally we must take into account commuting translational symmetries of the kind:

Hxy (kx, ky) = τyHxy (kx + π, ky) τy ,
Hxy (kx, ky) = τxHxy (kx, ky + π) τx .

(B.5)

(B.6)

The eﬀect of these sets of symmetries is that, given a Weyl point in a particular
position, there will be two symmetric zero-energy points, with opposite monopole charge,
which share respectively the same kx and ky component.

Therefore, analogously to the symmetries (17,18), also the previous relations imply
that, if we consider a boundary orthogonal to either the ˆx or the ˆy direction, two Weyl

Double Weyl points and Fermi arcs of topological semimetals in...

19

points with opposite Berry monopole will overlap in the surface Brillouin zone and the
related Fermi arcs will acquire a non-zero energy.

In order to avoid this, we have to introduce an additional term in the Hamiltonian,
in such a way to break the symmetries (17,B.1,B.3,B.5) to avoid overlaps in the kx
direction, or to break (18,B.2,B.4,B.6) in order to avoid the overlaps in the ky direction.
As discussed in the main text, such an additional term necessarily breaks the SU (2)
gauge invariance and anti-commutes with Hz. Thus a simple Zeeman splitting is
not suﬃcient. The term Hxx in Eq.
(19) violates all the symmetries in the set
(17,B.1,B.3,B.5).
